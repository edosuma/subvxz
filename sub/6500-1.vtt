03:27.972 --> 03:28.936
Why must you be this way?

03:29.974 --> 03:33.171
Why is there always a problem?
It's a good question.

03:35.046 --> 03:37.014
Do you want to go home?
Do you want to turn around?

03:37.081 --> 03:40.414
- Yes!
- It's the Himalayas!

03:40.485 --> 03:43.181
How long have I been talking
about the Himalayas?

03:43.254 --> 03:45.518
- How long?
- Far too long.

03:46.657 --> 03:50.491
Horst, when we get there,
can you give me a hand, please?

03:50.561 --> 03:53.655
- Yes, of course.
- Ingrid, stop it.

04:12.016 --> 04:15.452
Let's try to make the best of this.

04:18.022 --> 04:20.115
Where's this idiot
who's supposed to meet us?

04:22.160 --> 04:23.218
Move!

04:27.398 --> 04:28.729
Mr. Harrer.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.461
I have your tickets.

04:30.535 --> 04:34.403
- I'm late. Take me to my train.
- No, you don't understand.

04:34.472 --> 04:37.873
I am Peter Aufschnaiter.
I am leading the expedition.

04:37.942 --> 04:40.035
- How do you do?
- Here's our celebrity!

04:40.111 --> 04:42.045
Mr. Harrer?

04:42.113 --> 04:46.072
<i>May I say, Mr. Harrer,
on behalf of the Reichssportsfuhrer...</i>

04:46.150 --> 04:49.347
we are honored to have
such a great German hero on the team.

04:49.420 --> 04:51.888
Thank you, but I'm Austrian.

04:51.956 --> 04:54.322
Yes, but I'm sure that
as a distinguished member...

04:54.392 --> 04:57.418
of the National Socialist Party,
you would be proud to plant...

04:57.495 --> 05:02.489
our country's flag on the summit
of Nanga Parbat when you reach it.

05:02.567 --> 05:04.535
Hans Lobenhoffer.

05:04.602 --> 05:06.194
Lutz Chicken.

05:09.107 --> 05:11.735
And a picture with your lovely wife.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.547
And Mr...

05:17.615 --> 05:20.550
Horst Immendorf. Family friend.
No picture necessary.

05:23.955 --> 05:25.889
When is the little one due,
Mrs. Harrer?

05:25.957 --> 05:28.448
About the time my husband
reaches the base camp.

05:30.061 --> 05:32.393
Thank you.

05:32.463 --> 05:35.091
Why don't you tell the entire
stinking country our troubles?

05:36.868 --> 05:39.268
I'm getting on that train.
Do you have anything you want to say?

05:43.307 --> 05:44.365
Fine.

05:45.576 --> 05:47.510
Go. Leave.

05:49.413 --> 05:51.904
I'll see you in four months.

05:53.818 --> 05:56.150
- Take good care of her, Horst.
- I will, Heinrich.

07:17.468 --> 07:20.164
<i>We will travel 5,000 miles.</i>

07:20.238 --> 07:22.832
<i>When we reach India,
we will head for the Himalayas...</i>

07:22.907 --> 07:25.842
<i>and the ninth highest peak
on Earth, Nanga Parbat.</i>

07:25.910 --> 07:29.402
<i>Germany calls it "Unserberg...
Our Mountain. "</i>

07:30.681 --> 07:33.616
<i>Before us, four German expeditions
attempted it.</i>

07:33.684 --> 07:35.242
<i>All failed.</i>

07:35.319 --> 07:38.982
<i>Eleven climbers were killed
in storms and avalanches.</i>

07:39.056 --> 07:43.618
<i>By now, the conquest of Nanga Parbat
is a national obsession...</i>

07:43.694 --> 07:46.060
<i>a matter of German pride.</i>

07:51.469 --> 07:53.994
<i>July 29, 1939.</i>

07:54.071 --> 07:57.905
<i>We have already made Camp Four
at 22,000 feet.</i>

07:57.975 --> 08:02.969
<i>Overhead is the Rekiak Glacier
and a difficult climb up the icefall.</i>

08:06.083 --> 08:08.677
<i>The baby must be
at least one month old now.</i>

08:10.321 --> 08:13.620
<i>I have been
so confused and distracted.</i>

08:13.691 --> 08:16.489
<i>I can't climb
with my usual confidence.</i>

08:43.120 --> 08:45.281
Are you all right?

08:50.628 --> 08:52.220
Shit!

08:53.998 --> 08:57.661
- Are you all right?
- Shall we come down?

08:59.970 --> 09:01.767
Lost a crampon!

09:01.839 --> 09:03.568
Go ahead!

09:26.163 --> 09:28.893
The weather's getting bad.
We should rope up.

09:30.501 --> 09:35.939
- Did you hurt yourself back there?
- Just a scratch. I'll lead.

10:05.536 --> 10:07.401
Rocks!

10:07.471 --> 10:09.803
Look out below!

10:18.048 --> 10:20.516
Hold me!

10:33.063 --> 10:34.997
Have you got me?

10:44.041 --> 10:45.975
Hold me!

11:47.805 --> 11:50.171
You should have told me
how bad that wound was.

11:50.941 --> 11:53.910
I should take a look at it.
I could sew it up.

11:58.916 --> 12:00.645
It's not your problem.

12:03.654 --> 12:05.588
Actually, it is my problem.

12:05.656 --> 12:08.784
- It's my life.
- What?

12:08.859 --> 12:12.488
When you conceal a serious injury
and put my life at risk...

12:12.563 --> 12:14.531
I consider that my problem.

12:14.598 --> 12:17.692
No, you put your life at risk.
I saved it, so shut up!

12:17.768 --> 12:19.963
Please, it is not your place...

12:20.037 --> 12:21.629
Shut up!

12:23.374 --> 12:26.104
The next time you lie
about an injury, Heinrich...

12:27.077 --> 12:29.011
you're off the team.

12:32.349 --> 12:34.146
Try it.

13:54.665 --> 13:58.396
<i>August 4th, Camp Five.
Some fierce storms have passed.</i>

13:58.469 --> 14:01.461
<i>My teammates are nervous
about the avalanches...</i>

14:01.538 --> 14:04.006
<i>so we've been holed up for days.</i>

14:04.074 --> 14:08.306
<i>Aufschnaiter should take advantage of
this lowland weather to make high camp.</i>

14:08.379 --> 14:12.042
<i>But he disagrees with me. Fool.</i>

14:14.151 --> 14:17.086
<i>It seems the others don't mind
sitting here waiting...</i>

14:17.154 --> 14:19.918
<i>hoping, doing nothing.</i>

14:19.990 --> 14:24.723
<i>So much time to question
one's self is not good.</i>

14:27.297 --> 14:30.289
<i>I am beginning to think
this whole expedition was a mistake.</i>

14:48.886 --> 14:50.820
Run! Avalanche! Get out!

14:55.926 --> 14:57.120
Leave everything!

15:11.909 --> 15:13.843
Put that down!

15:15.079 --> 15:16.808
We are going down now!

15:16.880 --> 15:19.747
If they're frightened of a storm,
send them down to Camp Two.

15:19.817 --> 15:23.150
I could summit on my own!
Always give the best man his shot!

15:23.220 --> 15:25.711
He's trying to tell us
he's the best man.

15:25.789 --> 15:28.019
Give me two Sherpas.
I can make Camp Six by tonight...

15:28.092 --> 15:30.026
and my final attack tomorrow!

15:30.094 --> 15:33.063
- We are going down now as a team!
- I've earned that peak!

15:33.130 --> 15:35.064
- I want that peak!
- As a team! That's an order!

15:35.132 --> 15:38.693
That is an order! An order!

15:39.903 --> 15:41.495
Follow me!

16:43.734 --> 16:46.862
Dalai Lama photo. Good protection.

16:46.937 --> 16:49.804
<i>Take it, Si Hib.
It will protect you.</i>

16:49.873 --> 16:53.240
No, that means nothing to me.

16:53.310 --> 16:55.938
Dalai Lama. Dalai Lama photo.

16:56.013 --> 16:57.776
<i>Si Hib, take it.</i>

16:57.848 --> 16:59.782
Good protection for you.

17:13.497 --> 17:14.797
Good afternoon, Herr Harrer.

17:14.832 --> 17:16.097
Good afternoon, Herr Harrer.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.327
Well, let's hope that Germany
retreats from Poland...

17:18.402 --> 17:20.597
as quickly as you did
from your mountain.

17:20.671 --> 17:23.138
It might save you some prison time.

17:24.907 --> 17:26.842
What is this? Who are you?

17:26.910 --> 17:31.938
- I'm sorry, but you're under arrest.
- What charge? Failure to summit?

17:32.015 --> 17:33.482
I'm afraid not.

17:34.651 --> 17:38.815
You see, war has been declared between
His Majesty's Government and Germany.

17:38.889 --> 17:43.952
So all enemy aliens on British Empire
soil are now prisoners of war.

18:27.738 --> 18:30.673
- Stop, or I'll shoot!
- Hands up!

18:30.741 --> 18:33.403
No, you don't understand!
I'm Austrian! I'm a climber!

18:33.477 --> 18:36.708
I have nothing to do
with your silly war!

18:42.252 --> 18:45.813
I can walk myself.
This is an insult!

18:47.658 --> 18:50.684
You think you have the last word,
but you don't!

18:50.761 --> 18:53.525
Pigs! All of you, pigs!

19:07.010 --> 19:08.944
<i>October 15, 1939.</i>

19:11.715 --> 19:14.616
<i>Reaching prison camp,
I make a promise to myself.</i>

19:16.486 --> 19:20.718
<i>I will be lying beside Ingrid before
the summer solstice of the new year.</i>

19:22.626 --> 19:25.151
<i>The Himalayas are right in front of us.</i>

19:25.228 --> 19:28.197
<i>It will be easy to escape
and get lost in them.</i>

19:41.078 --> 19:44.639
<i>My fourth escape attempt
brings me no closer to my goal.</i>

19:45.716 --> 19:48.082
How far did you get this time?

19:48.151 --> 19:52.087
<i>All I have achieved is a certain
dubious celebrity among the prisoners.</i>

20:16.980 --> 20:20.746
<i>If only my hand could express
what is in my heart.</i>

20:35.265 --> 20:37.529
I hear the guards
are mailing letters for you.

20:38.735 --> 20:39.929
Yes.

20:40.003 --> 20:42.471
Would you mail these?

20:45.042 --> 20:47.442
Thank you.

20:47.511 --> 20:49.877
Hey, Heinrich, have you read this book?

20:49.946 --> 20:52.312
It was checked out to you.

20:57.554 --> 21:00.523
- We need to talk to you.
- What about?

21:00.590 --> 21:02.057
About this.

21:10.567 --> 21:13.468
Impressive. When do you plan to leave?

21:13.537 --> 21:15.562
After monsoon season. And you?

21:17.374 --> 21:21.470
I see you've chosen
my route through Tibet.

21:21.545 --> 21:25.481
The few foreigners who have tried
never came back. So, good luck.

21:25.549 --> 21:28.814
- Would you like to come with us?
- Why?

21:28.885 --> 21:32.048
After all, you are the authority
on jailbreak around here.

21:32.122 --> 21:35.683
- We could benefit from your experience.
- Please.

21:37.327 --> 21:39.591
Stop this embarrassing charade.

21:41.064 --> 21:44.898
Every time you escape,
the patrols are doubled and tripled.

21:44.968 --> 21:48.233
It is making life very difficult
for the rest of us.

21:48.305 --> 21:51.365
I prefer to travel on my own,
but thanks for thinking of me.

22:00.050 --> 22:01.984
The mailman has come.

22:40.790 --> 22:42.382
<i>Dear Heinrich:</i>

22:42.459 --> 22:46.156
<i>Please sign the enclosed divorce papers
and send them to my lawyer.</i>

22:46.229 --> 22:50.290
<i>Horst and I intend to be married
as soon as the divorce is finalized.</i>

22:50.367 --> 22:52.301
<i>As for your letter, yes.</i>

22:52.369 --> 22:56.328
<i>Your son, Rolf Harrer, was born
while you were climbing the mountain.</i>

22:56.406 --> 23:00.342
<i>He is now two years old
and calls Horst "papa."</i>

23:00.410 --> 23:02.605
<i>When he is old enough,
I will tell him...</i>

23:02.679 --> 23:05.307
<i>his real father was lost
in the Himalayas.</i>

23:05.382 --> 23:07.441
<i>It seems the kindest thing
to say considering...</i>

23:07.517 --> 23:09.985
<i>you never wanted the child anyway.</i>

23:10.053 --> 23:12.613
<i>Needless to say,
I have no intention...</i>

23:12.689 --> 23:16.420
<i>of "resolving our differences"
as you suggested.</i>

23:16.493 --> 23:19.951
<i>They were resolved
the moment you left Austria.</i>

23:20.030 --> 23:23.193
<i>I'm sorry you have been
imprisoned in India...</i>

23:23.266 --> 23:27.464
<i>and hope this dreadful war will soon
be over for everyone's sake.</i>

23:27.537 --> 23:29.129
<i>Ingrid.</i>

24:57.260 --> 24:58.591
I'm coming with you.

25:07.370 --> 25:08.837
This is your plan?

25:12.876 --> 25:16.004
In my humble opinion,
this is ridiculous.

25:16.079 --> 25:18.946
Then since you are so humble,
we won't ask your opinion.

26:04.561 --> 26:06.791
Open the charts. Turn around.

26:06.863 --> 26:10.765
Keep your back to the gate.
Open the charts!

26:26.082 --> 26:29.279
Keep talking. Wait for my signal.

26:30.387 --> 26:32.412
We are clear. Okay.

26:45.869 --> 26:47.461
Open the gates!

26:55.145 --> 26:58.706
See to this. Open the gates!

27:33.883 --> 27:35.851
I'm going off on my own.

27:35.919 --> 27:37.978
So, good luck.

28:13.590 --> 28:19.460
<i>First escape from prison camp,
November 18, 1939.</i>

28:19.529 --> 28:22.657
<i>Rolf Harrer...
three and a half months old.</i>

28:24.968 --> 28:29.029
<i>My 30th birthday, July 6, 1941.</i>

28:29.105 --> 28:33.940
<i>Rolf Harrer... exactly one year,
11 months and 26 days.</i>

28:36.379 --> 28:39.780
<i>Last escape from Dehra Dun.
Rolf Harrer...</i>

31:08.031 --> 31:12.263
Take two and sleep it off.
I'll send you a bill in the morning.

31:16.339 --> 31:18.273
What are you doing here?

31:18.341 --> 31:23.506
I missed you so much.
I thought I'd pay you a visit.

31:27.483 --> 31:29.917
What about the others?

31:29.986 --> 31:32.614
The Italians were caught
outside Nelang.

31:32.689 --> 31:35.749
Lutz and Hans got sick
and had to turn back.

31:37.794 --> 31:40.786
- Sorry to hear that.
- I'm sure you're heartbroken.

31:43.433 --> 31:47.392
May I impose upon your generous nature
and camp here tonight?

31:47.470 --> 31:49.404
Be my guest.

31:49.472 --> 31:52.669
Thank you.
It is very gracious of you.

32:13.129 --> 32:15.063
- Good.
- What else do you have in there?

32:15.131 --> 32:17.361
A ten-piece orchestra?

32:17.433 --> 32:21.836
By the way, I heard
the Japanese have retreated...

32:21.904 --> 32:25.931
all the way back to Shanghai so even
if you make it to the Chinese border...

32:26.008 --> 32:27.999
you may have difficulty
catching up with them.

32:28.077 --> 32:30.705
I don't care if they're repelled
all the way back to Tokyo.

32:30.780 --> 32:32.771
You should if you want
to get back to Austria.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.911
- But I don't.
- Don't what?

32:38.221 --> 32:40.917
- Plan to go back.
- Why not?

32:44.160 --> 32:47.095
No particular reason.

32:47.163 --> 32:48.960
When you get there, tell my wife...

32:49.031 --> 32:53.058
that two years in prison camp is roughly
equivalent to four years of marriage.

32:53.136 --> 32:55.696
And I'm glad to be free of them both.

32:58.708 --> 33:02.940
I'm not going back either,
not until this shameful war is over.

33:03.012 --> 33:05.742
- And where are you headed?
- Tibet.

33:05.815 --> 33:10.411
Then on to China,
see if I can find some work there.

33:11.587 --> 33:12.952
And you?

33:13.022 --> 33:17.482
By my calculations, the Chinese border
is 2,058 kilometers away.

33:17.560 --> 33:20.154
Tibet is 68.

33:20.229 --> 33:24.393
It's a long way to travel
with such a heavy load.

33:25.501 --> 33:27.867
No, just full of food.

33:27.937 --> 33:30.735
- Precisely.
- Mine.

33:32.508 --> 33:34.066
That's too bad.

33:34.143 --> 33:37.977
Those mountains are treacherous.
There are glaciers to be crossed.

33:38.047 --> 33:40.242
If you had roped up to me,
I could have kept you alive.

33:40.316 --> 33:42.648
Considering your performance
the last time we roped up...

33:42.718 --> 33:44.913
I think I'm safer without you.

33:49.225 --> 33:50.487
Of course.

33:54.864 --> 33:59.164
But I think you are wrong about
that Tibetan border calculation.

33:59.235 --> 34:02.432
By my measurements,
it is 65 kilometers.

34:05.675 --> 34:07.609
Care to wager a kilo of food on that?

34:10.513 --> 34:14.449
All you've got is some stale crackers.

34:15.918 --> 34:18.614
But I'm right. I'll win.

35:00.196 --> 35:03.029
<i>Tibet, the roof of the world.</i>

35:03.099 --> 35:06.227
<i>It feels as though we have
ascended a medieval stone fortress...</i>

35:06.302 --> 35:09.135
<i>towering above the center of Asia.</i>

35:09.205 --> 35:11.696
<i>This is the highest country on Earth.</i>

35:11.774 --> 35:13.708
<i>And the most isolated.</i>

35:22.718 --> 35:24.242
There it is.

35:25.288 --> 35:27.188
Tibet.

35:28.357 --> 35:32.020
- Exactly 68 kilometers.
- Congratulations.

35:33.396 --> 35:35.694
Unfortunately, you've eaten
all your winnings.

35:53.816 --> 35:55.044
Yes.

35:55.117 --> 35:58.086
Just smile and say yes.
It's better that way.

36:01.691 --> 36:03.886
It's amazing what you learn
in prison, isn't it?

36:13.769 --> 36:15.327
Tibet.

36:18.040 --> 36:20.634
- No foreigners allowed in Tibet.
- Oh, please!

36:20.710 --> 36:22.234
No foreigner!

36:22.311 --> 36:24.302
Oh, please!

36:31.454 --> 36:34.617
Yes. Thank you. Of course.

37:02.184 --> 37:04.152
No translation needed.

37:35.718 --> 37:38.016
Some people are glad to see us.

37:38.087 --> 37:40.385
Don't let it get to your head.

37:40.456 --> 37:44.586
When the Tibetans clap hands, it means
they are driving out evil forces.

37:50.733 --> 37:52.667
We need to find food.

38:07.083 --> 38:10.712
It is the prophecy. It says here...

38:10.786 --> 38:14.984
in the final testament
of great thirteenth Dalai Lama.

38:15.057 --> 38:18.823
"It may happen that, in Tibet,
religions and government...

38:18.894 --> 38:21.658
will be attacked by outside forces.

38:21.730 --> 38:25.029
Unless we can guard our own country...

38:25.101 --> 38:28.332
monks and their monasteries
will be destroyed.

38:28.404 --> 38:32.170
The lands and property
of government officials will be seized.

38:32.241 --> 38:36.075
The Dalai Lama and all
the revered holders of the faith...

38:36.145 --> 38:38.670
will disappear and become nameless."

38:38.747 --> 38:42.444
Now you understand why we are not
welcome to foreigners here?

38:42.518 --> 38:46.614
Yes, but you must understand
we're not here to threaten or harm.

38:46.689 --> 38:48.919
We just need food,
and then we'll be on our...

38:48.991 --> 38:51.016
His Excellency, the Garpon.

38:57.433 --> 39:01.062
Your Eminence, we're happy to see you.

39:01.137 --> 39:04.038
We wanted to apologize.

39:04.106 --> 39:05.698
Apologize.

39:08.677 --> 39:11.703
And give you this really special gift.

39:14.383 --> 39:16.476
Please, from us.

39:16.552 --> 39:19.817
Long live the Dalai Lama,
His Holiness.

39:26.662 --> 39:29.722
Thank you for the picture.
Go back to India!

39:36.205 --> 39:40.608
<i>Two days into Tibet's western frontier
and we are graciously kicked out.</i>

39:41.710 --> 39:43.940
<i>Our guides have strict orders
to escort us...</i>

39:44.013 --> 39:47.176
<i>to the Indian border
some 40 kilometers away...</i>

39:47.249 --> 39:50.082
<i>and to shoot us
if we attempt escape.</i>

40:23.852 --> 40:25.945
Must mean hello.

40:26.021 --> 40:28.285
As long as they don't try to kiss me.

40:32.528 --> 40:35.053
We have to stock up. I'm broke.

40:36.498 --> 40:38.432
Don't look at me.

40:38.500 --> 40:41.867
We have to eat, Peter.
Know what time it is?

40:43.239 --> 40:45.605
It is not negotiable.

40:45.674 --> 40:48.165
My father gave it to me
when I climbed Mount Blanc.

40:48.244 --> 40:50.371
Everyone's climbed Mount Blanc.

40:50.446 --> 40:52.641
If I had a watch like this,
I would trade it.

41:36.358 --> 41:38.792
- Where did you get this jacket?
- North Tibet.

41:38.861 --> 41:41.386
Communism soldier come from China.
Very nice.

41:41.463 --> 41:44.432
They give food, money. Very nice.
Communism soldier.

41:47.069 --> 41:49.469
You like military uniforms, yes?

41:50.606 --> 41:54.440
I have German army boots.
For you. Yes?

41:54.510 --> 41:55.875
Wait.

42:04.486 --> 42:07.114
Give me these, for the guards.

42:07.189 --> 42:08.656
Look!

42:14.763 --> 42:16.890
Like this. You like?

42:19.101 --> 42:21.069
Very good. They're tough.

42:21.136 --> 42:24.902
My friend, shall I show you
how German soldiers march?

42:30.079 --> 42:32.343
You must make this face.

42:41.557 --> 42:43.889
Come! Yes.

42:43.959 --> 42:45.551
Stop!

42:47.529 --> 42:50.657
Excellent. Yes.
You, with practice.

42:51.500 --> 42:55.197
Now, I will show you
how German soldiers run.

42:59.675 --> 43:01.609
Stand like this.

43:49.892 --> 43:51.826
Guess what?

43:53.495 --> 43:55.292
All clear.

44:18.187 --> 44:20.849
Know what time it is?

44:23.392 --> 44:27.761
You think I'm so happy
to be traveling with you...

44:27.830 --> 44:30.390
I should foot the bill?

44:30.466 --> 44:33.867
You are such a big man
you don't need to contribute?

44:35.037 --> 44:36.629
You have a problem?

44:36.705 --> 44:38.138
Remind me...

44:39.274 --> 44:42.368
what you said at the bazaar back there.

44:42.444 --> 44:47.780
"If I had a watch like that,
I would trade it."

44:50.118 --> 44:52.951
You do not have one.

44:53.021 --> 44:56.320
You cheap, lying bastard!
You have three!

45:08.403 --> 45:10.871
This is junk
from some Italian prisoners.

45:10.939 --> 45:13.339
I don't give a shit!

45:13.408 --> 45:15.535
Haven't you ever heard of a principle?

45:15.611 --> 45:18.102
What principle?

45:18.180 --> 45:21.172
You want a watch?
Go ahead. Pick one.

45:21.250 --> 45:23.741
- And keep your principles.
- Look at you!

45:25.254 --> 45:28.348
Caught being a selfish brat
and you're gloating!

45:28.423 --> 45:31.324
You're acting like an old woman.
What do you want?

45:31.393 --> 45:34.760
Try apologizing.

45:34.830 --> 45:36.889
Try feeling a little remorse.

45:36.965 --> 45:40.457
And if all else fails,
try wiping that smirk off your face!

45:40.536 --> 45:42.970
Take your stinking watch
and shut up!

45:44.273 --> 45:48.505
I don't need another boring sermon from
some frustrated glorified tour guide.

45:58.186 --> 46:00.552
No wonder you are always alone.

46:00.622 --> 46:03.819
No one can stand
your miserable company.

46:35.824 --> 46:38.224
Please, take them.

46:47.269 --> 46:49.635
It was wrong of me to hide them.

47:00.916 --> 47:03.248
- Keep this.
- No.

47:07.856 --> 47:12.316
I didn't deserve it either.
Go ahead.

47:29.177 --> 47:32.112
He'll be three and a half years old now.

47:36.485 --> 47:39.886
Pretty soon, she'll tell him
I was lost in the Himalayas.

47:43.291 --> 47:44.724
Which is fine.

47:46.662 --> 47:48.254
Why?

47:51.366 --> 47:54.460
Better a dead father
than a lousy father.

47:56.304 --> 47:58.238
Write him a letter.

47:59.741 --> 48:01.902
Let him know you're still alive.

48:10.752 --> 48:13.016
New York.

48:17.559 --> 48:19.151
Venice.

48:24.900 --> 48:28.063
- Paris.
- Your Holiness, where are you?

48:28.136 --> 48:30.229
It is time for your lesson.

48:35.610 --> 48:40.513
Your Holiness, where are you?
It is time for your lesson.

48:43.685 --> 48:45.209
<i>Dear Rolf Harrer:</i>

48:46.288 --> 48:48.552
<i>I'm a person you don't know...</i>

48:48.623 --> 48:51.421
<i>a man you've never met.</i>

48:51.493 --> 48:54.223
<i>But you are someone
who occupies my mind...</i>

48:54.296 --> 48:56.196
<i>and my heart...</i>

48:56.264 --> 48:58.357
<i>in this distant land
where I have gone.</i>

49:00.502 --> 49:04.461
<i>If you can imagine a hidden place
tucked safely away from the world...</i>

49:04.539 --> 49:07.940
<i>concealed by walls
of high, snowcapped mountains...</i>

49:08.009 --> 49:11.604
<i>a place rich with all the strange
beauty of your nighttime dreams...</i>

49:13.281 --> 49:15.215
<i>then you know where I am.</i>

49:18.220 --> 49:20.154
<i>In the country
where I am traveling, Tibet...</i>

49:21.056 --> 49:24.423
<i>people believe if they walk
long distances to holy places...</i>

49:24.493 --> 49:27.326
<i>it purifies the bad deeds
they've committed.</i>

49:27.395 --> 49:29.920
<i>They believe
the more difficult the journey...</i>

49:29.998 --> 49:32.626
<i>the greater the depth
of purification.</i>

49:36.004 --> 49:39.804
<i>I've been walking from one faraway
place to the next for many years...</i>

49:40.976 --> 49:43.137
<i>as long as you have lived.</i>

49:44.312 --> 49:47.839
<i>I have seen seasons change
across the high plateaus.</i>

49:47.916 --> 49:51.147
<i>I have seen wild kiangs
migrate south in winter...</i>

49:51.219 --> 49:54.154
<i>and sweep back across the fields
when spring appears.</i>

49:56.124 --> 49:58.615
<i>In this place,
where time stands still...</i>

49:58.693 --> 50:00.627
<i>it seems that everything is moving...</i>

50:01.596 --> 50:03.461
<i>including me.</i>

50:06.868 --> 50:08.836
<i>I can't say I know where I'm going...</i>

50:08.904 --> 50:11.930
<i>nor whether my bad deeds
can be purified.</i>

50:13.441 --> 50:16.535
<i>There are so many things
I have done which I regret.</i>

50:17.646 --> 50:21.446
<i>But when I come to a full stop,
I hope you will understand...</i>

50:21.516 --> 50:25.145
<i>that the distance between us
is not as great as it seems.</i>

50:26.822 --> 50:28.653
<i>With deep affection...</i>

50:28.723 --> 50:32.215
<i>your father, Heinrich Harrer.</i>

50:33.195 --> 50:34.787
Get up.

50:44.773 --> 50:46.365
My God!

50:51.112 --> 50:52.977
I'll give you these.

51:13.435 --> 51:15.767
Yellow head!

51:15.837 --> 51:18.772
- No! Wait! We have nothing!
- Give me money!

51:18.840 --> 51:20.273
We have no money!

51:20.342 --> 51:22.242
Give me watch!

51:22.310 --> 51:24.835
- Give me clothes!
- We have nothing for you!

52:30.278 --> 52:32.212
Wait!

52:37.919 --> 52:39.853
Where are you headed?

52:44.392 --> 52:47.156
I have permit.

52:58.606 --> 53:00.540
Lhasa. I have permit.

53:46.988 --> 53:51.084
It is unseemly for the spiritual leader
of Tibet to spy on people.

53:56.131 --> 54:00.090
<i>Only a month ago, we were certain
of death at the hands of bandits.</i>

54:00.168 --> 54:05.936
<i>And today, we have reached the gates
of the forbidden city of Lhasa.</i>

54:06.007 --> 54:08.805
<i>It is as difficult a goal as Mecca...</i>

54:08.877 --> 54:13.644
<i>and precisely as attractive
because it is closed to all foreigners.</i>

54:15.050 --> 54:17.484
<i>Even in our miserable condition...</i>

54:17.552 --> 54:20.544
<i>we feel the lure
of Tibet's holiest city...</i>

54:20.622 --> 54:23.022
<i>home of the Dalai Lama.</i>

54:23.858 --> 54:26.793
<i>Only a few foreigners
had penetrated its mysteries.</i>

55:31.860 --> 55:35.023
Oh, my God!

55:46.774 --> 55:49.766
- Is it over?
- No, it is not over.

56:31.152 --> 56:34.087
You are invited to stay
for lunch, if you like.

56:35.290 --> 56:36.882
We'd like that very much.

56:38.560 --> 56:41.358
I am Tsarong. Welcome to my home.

56:41.429 --> 56:43.829
I am Peter.

56:48.269 --> 56:50.499
Lord Chamberlain, may I request...

56:50.572 --> 56:54.235
an audience with the regent
and ministers of the cabinet?

56:54.309 --> 56:58.678
It's about two foreigners
who came to Lhasa.

57:03.751 --> 57:05.685
With respect, Rinpoche...

57:06.654 --> 57:09.748
if your intention is to stop the Chinese
from recruiting political allies...

57:09.824 --> 57:15.228
then demanding that they stop
trying to bribe monks...

57:15.296 --> 57:17.696
is not the most effective tactic.

57:19.968 --> 57:24.268
I asked the opinion of the ministers,
not that of a mere secretary.

57:27.575 --> 57:31.102
Of course. Forgive me.

57:31.179 --> 57:33.044
You may leave now.

57:33.114 --> 57:36.606
Start translating the letter
as written.

57:36.684 --> 57:39.244
Of course.

57:56.537 --> 57:59.836
Do you realize how many men
could survive such an ordeal?

58:00.842 --> 58:02.810
We should respect them.

58:02.877 --> 58:06.938
If we return them to India,
they'll surely go back to prison.

58:07.015 --> 58:10.348
But they have no purpose here,
Kungo Tsarong. No place to live.

58:10.418 --> 58:14.252
I have invited them to stay
at my guest quarters...

58:14.322 --> 58:18.656
assuming you would grant them permission
to remain in Lhasa, of course.

58:18.726 --> 58:21.593
Invited them to stay at your place?

58:22.163 --> 58:23.653
But why?

58:23.731 --> 58:26.757
Must one have reason
to help those in need?

58:29.904 --> 58:31.394
Beast.

58:36.244 --> 58:38.178
I think she said you stink.

59:13.281 --> 59:16.148
You do not need
to introduce yourselves.

59:16.217 --> 59:18.151
I know who you are.

59:18.986 --> 59:21.284
I am Pema Lhaki.

59:21.356 --> 59:25.156
Ngawang wishes to make a gift to you,
so please take your clothes off.

59:29.330 --> 59:31.525
Let's get started.
I don't have all day.

59:31.599 --> 59:36.901
Well, this is most kind
of Ngawang Jigme.

59:36.971 --> 59:39.439
Who is he to be so thoughtful?

59:39.507 --> 59:41.975
Secretary to the ministers
of the government.

59:42.043 --> 59:44.705
He wished to make you
a gift of new clothes.

59:44.779 --> 59:47.805
Please select your preferred
article of clothing.

59:50.451 --> 59:52.078
You're a seamstress?

59:52.153 --> 59:56.214
I am a tailor, sir,
the only tailor in Lhasa...

59:56.290 --> 01:00:00.124
who has been to Calcutta and
can reproduce these silly costumes.

01:00:02.830 --> 01:00:05.731
So, I pick?

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:08.268
Yes, choose whichever you like.

01:00:12.106 --> 01:00:14.301
- And you can make any of these?
- Yes.

01:00:15.176 --> 01:00:18.145
- Very good.
- Did you make this?

01:00:18.212 --> 01:00:21.443
- Yes.
- Beautiful.

01:00:21.516 --> 01:00:23.211
- Thank you.
- Do you like this?

01:00:23.284 --> 01:00:25.218
Whichever you like.

01:00:28.289 --> 01:00:30.985
I will have this handsome tweed jacket.

01:00:31.058 --> 01:00:34.721
And this pair of sporting
woolen trousers, please.

01:00:34.796 --> 01:00:37.162
- Good choice.
- Thanks.

01:00:37.231 --> 01:00:39.165
And you, sir?

01:00:42.804 --> 01:00:45.466
- Perhaps you could choose for me.
- Thank you.

01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:53.102
<i>Please, sir, take off your chu-pa.
I would like to measure.</i>

01:01:05.993 --> 01:01:07.688
Stand still, please.

01:01:11.899 --> 01:01:13.833
This way, please.

01:01:18.372 --> 01:01:20.306
- Stand still.
- Sorry.

01:01:29.283 --> 01:01:31.979
- No moving, please.
- I'm sorry.

01:01:41.629 --> 01:01:43.893
That way, you will never fall.
It's perfect.

01:01:43.965 --> 01:01:47.628
Still, walking up mountains
is a fool's pleasure, Heinrich.

01:01:47.702 --> 01:01:50.068
Not so foolish, really.

01:01:54.642 --> 01:01:56.132
Look at this.

01:01:58.613 --> 01:02:00.171
Go ahead.

01:02:04.952 --> 01:02:08.115
That's after I climbed
the Eiger North Face.

01:02:12.627 --> 01:02:18.031
That's Olympics.
Gold medal. Not important.

01:02:18.099 --> 01:02:23.059
Then this is another great difference
between our civilization and yours.

01:02:23.137 --> 01:02:24.900
You admire the man...

01:02:24.972 --> 01:02:29.136
who pushes his way to the top
in any walk of life...

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:32.577
while we admire the man
who abandons his ego.

01:02:35.316 --> 01:02:38.615
The average Tibetan wouldn't think
to thrust himself forward this way.

01:02:55.536 --> 01:02:57.595
Gentlemen.

01:03:00.942 --> 01:03:03.502
- I'm sorry. Have we met?
- No, we have not.

01:03:03.578 --> 01:03:06.138
I am Ngawang Jigme.

01:03:10.284 --> 01:03:13.276
- Yes, of course.
- Forgive us.

01:03:13.354 --> 01:03:16.050
Thank you for your generous gift.

01:03:16.123 --> 01:03:18.318
It's wonderful. Thank you.

01:03:20.561 --> 01:03:25.157
You are most welcome.
I am sure we will meet again.

01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:40.278
Perhaps you could help us explain...

01:03:40.348 --> 01:03:42.441
why the ministers...

01:03:42.516 --> 01:03:46.316
demand that the Chinese government...

01:03:46.387 --> 01:03:50.289
"...cease making generous
financial contributions...

01:03:50.358 --> 01:03:54.522
to Tibetan monasteries."

01:03:54.595 --> 01:03:58.929
Do our gifts displease your government?

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.198
I cannot speak for the regent
nor the ministers, Excellence.

01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:05.602
I am only a mere secretary.

01:04:05.673 --> 01:04:10.167
Not for long, I presume.
Sit down.

01:04:17.885 --> 01:04:21.321
A man of such obvious talent
cannot be satisfied...

01:04:21.389 --> 01:04:25.792
with just translating letters.

01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:28.988
Your diplomatic skill...

01:04:29.063 --> 01:04:31.861
would be richly rewarded here.

01:04:35.102 --> 01:04:38.765
Serving my country faithfully
is reward enough, Excellence.

01:04:42.043 --> 01:04:44.011
I ask permission to take my leave.

01:05:54.615 --> 01:05:57.311
It looks like we're both in need
of a good tailor today.

01:05:58.252 --> 01:05:59.776
Yes, there's a...

01:06:00.821 --> 01:06:03.085
Please, take a seat.

01:06:46.901 --> 01:06:49.335
Do you like these?
I'll buy them for you.

01:06:49.403 --> 01:06:52.600
Thank you,
but I don't eat much meat.

01:06:52.673 --> 01:06:55.836
- Don't eat meat?
- He says they are knives from West.

01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:58.276
You put them on your feet to cut meat.

01:07:02.349 --> 01:07:04.340
They are ice skates.

01:07:04.418 --> 01:07:06.886
You put them on your feet...

01:07:06.954 --> 01:07:08.285
to skate...

01:07:08.355 --> 01:07:11.017
to glide...
sort of dance on ice.

01:07:11.091 --> 01:07:12.991
- Yeah.
- Why?

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:16.689
- Why not?
- It's another fool's pleasure.

01:07:21.502 --> 01:07:23.902
Let's get them.
How mu...

01:07:28.909 --> 01:07:31.503
No, for this?

01:07:31.579 --> 01:07:33.171
Ten.

01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:37.383
And for this?

01:07:37.451 --> 01:07:39.385
Did you see?

01:07:40.287 --> 01:07:42.221
Did you see that?

01:07:53.367 --> 01:07:57.064
- Did you hurt yourself?
- No, thank you. I'm okay.

01:07:57.137 --> 01:08:00.698
Here we go. Up.

01:08:00.774 --> 01:08:04.870
- You okay? Did you bang your head?
- No, I'm having fun.

01:08:04.945 --> 01:08:07.277
- You must hold on.
- Watch me!

01:08:20.828 --> 01:08:23.160
- Do not look too much at the ground.
- All right.

01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:25.288
- Look only into my eyes.
- Yes, all right.

01:08:42.616 --> 01:08:46.108
Can I help you?
Here, take my hand.

01:08:53.961 --> 01:08:57.761
- Are you happy?
- Very happy.

01:09:21.555 --> 01:09:24.388
<i>I try to picture you, Rolf...</i>

01:09:24.457 --> 01:09:27.154
<i>and this is what I see:</i>

01:09:27.227 --> 01:09:30.457
<i>a young boy who is strong
and bright...</i>

01:09:31.865 --> 01:09:34.890
<i>a boy filled with curiosity
about life...</i>

01:09:36.904 --> 01:09:40.965
<i>a boy who isn't afraid
to learn from his mistakes.</i>

01:10:03.764 --> 01:10:05.288
Hello, married woman.

01:10:06.867 --> 01:10:09.165
Hello, bachelor man.

01:10:14.742 --> 01:10:16.573
Congratulations.

01:10:18.746 --> 01:10:22.079
Well, come in.

01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:25.346
<i>The Japanese army is facing
a growing challenge...</i>

01:10:25.419 --> 01:10:27.853
<i>not from China's unified front...</i>

01:10:27.921 --> 01:10:30.151
<i>but from the powerful
Chinese Communist Army.</i>

01:10:30.224 --> 01:10:32.590
<i>Under the control
of Mao Tse-tung...</i>

01:10:35.829 --> 01:10:39.390
The rumor is that
the Communists have taken over...

01:10:39.466 --> 01:10:42.264
the whole of North and Central China.

01:10:42.336 --> 01:10:44.236
Rumor? It's a fact.

01:10:44.304 --> 01:10:47.171
Ngawang keeps me up-to-date
on all China's war news.

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.915
So, how are things at Kungo Tsarong's?

01:11:03.991 --> 01:11:07.449
Frankly, I wouldn't know.
I moved out five months ago.

01:11:07.528 --> 01:11:10.929
Really? Has it been this long
since we have seen you?

01:11:10.998 --> 01:11:15.128
- Apparently it has.
- And have you been busy?

01:11:15.202 --> 01:11:18.262
This is why I'm extremely busy...

01:11:18.338 --> 01:11:21.364
since I've been hired to survey
the entire city of Lhasa.

01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:27.703
Unfortunately, your place is too
far out for me to include it on my map.

01:11:29.049 --> 01:11:31.415
We like our privacy.

01:11:33.921 --> 01:11:35.650
Yes, apparently so.

01:11:37.958 --> 01:11:40.825
What about women?
Have you met anyone you like?

01:11:42.396 --> 01:11:43.795
Women.

01:11:43.864 --> 01:11:47.095
Since I failed miserably
with an Austrian wife...

01:11:47.167 --> 01:11:49.829
an exotic failure with
a Tibetan wife seems misguided.

01:11:49.903 --> 01:11:53.805
But to answer your question,
no, I haven't. You?

01:11:56.176 --> 01:12:00.112
A friend's good fortune
is a blessing.

01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:02.114
I'm sorry you resent ours.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.584
You must be very lonely and sad.

01:12:30.911 --> 01:12:32.970
The war is over!

01:12:33.046 --> 01:12:34.775
Have the Communists won?

01:12:34.848 --> 01:12:37.783
Your war, my friend.
Germany has surrendered.

01:12:45.025 --> 01:12:49.462
- Where are you going?
- Back home. Austria.

01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:11.911
Mr. Harrer, letter.

01:13:17.658 --> 01:13:19.819
We miss you.

01:13:22.262 --> 01:13:23.661
I miss you.

01:13:40.814 --> 01:13:43.339
"Dear Mr. Heinrich Harrer:

01:13:43.417 --> 01:13:45.749
You are not my father.

01:13:45.819 --> 01:13:49.380
Please stop writing me letters.

01:13:49.456 --> 01:13:51.515
Rolf Immendorf."

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:22.345
Honorable Harry Harrer?

01:14:27.628 --> 01:14:29.823
- Yes?
- A letter for you.

01:14:30.931 --> 01:14:34.298
The Honorable Heinrich Harrer
doesn't want any more letters.

01:14:34.368 --> 01:14:38.464
It is from the Great Mother
of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.

01:15:08.368 --> 01:15:10.393
Thank you for coming, Mr. Harrer.

01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:13.496
Thank you for inviting me,
Great Mother.

01:15:23.116 --> 01:15:26.847
Do you know the rules
of protocol concerning my son?

01:15:28.789 --> 01:15:33.852
Not exact... I know one bows
and performs prostrations.

01:15:35.429 --> 01:15:37.897
When you are in the presence
of His Holiness...

01:15:37.964 --> 01:15:40.262
you must always be standing...

01:15:40.334 --> 01:15:44.270
bent in obeisance,
hands folded in supplication.

01:15:44.338 --> 01:15:48.365
If seated, you must always
be seated lower than he.

01:15:48.442 --> 01:15:52.401
Never look him in the eye.
Never speak before he does.

01:15:52.479 --> 01:15:55.539
Always refer to him
as "Your Holiness."

01:15:55.615 --> 01:15:59.642
Never turn your back to him.
And never, never touch him.

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:03.156
He is the reincarnation
of Avalokiteshvara...

01:16:03.223 --> 01:16:05.191
the Bodhisattva of Compassion.

01:16:06.793 --> 01:16:09.762
After his recognition,
he was renamed...

01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:14.961
Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang
Yeshi Tenzin Gyatso...

01:16:15.035 --> 01:16:19.768
Holy Lord, Gentle Glory,
Eloquent, Compassionate...

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:24.607
Learned Defender of the Faith,
Ocean of Wisdom.

01:16:25.812 --> 01:16:29.748
His Holiness, the Dalai Lama,
would like to meet you.

01:16:32.886 --> 01:16:37.550
As his advisors have not permitted
a private audience with you...

01:16:37.624 --> 01:16:43.085
His Holiness has asked me to bring you
along to my monthly audience.

01:16:51.838 --> 01:16:54.272
I'd be honored and moved.

01:18:55.462 --> 01:18:56.656
Yellow head.

01:19:06.506 --> 01:19:09.031
You have hair on your arms too?
And legs?

01:19:19.386 --> 01:19:21.411
- How about you?
- Mr. Harrer.

01:19:26.326 --> 01:19:28.692
It's an honor to meet you,
Your Holiness.

01:19:41.474 --> 01:19:43.032
Do you like movies?

01:19:45.779 --> 01:19:47.906
You know, I haven't seen a movie
in about eight years.

01:19:47.981 --> 01:19:51.576
- But as I recall, yes, very much.
- So do I.

01:19:51.651 --> 01:19:56.588
- I'm glad to hear that.
- I have a movie projector. And films.

01:19:56.656 --> 01:20:00.820
I want to build a movie house.
Here, at the Potala.

01:20:00.894 --> 01:20:04.261
- With seats and everything.
- Seats would be advisable.

01:20:04.331 --> 01:20:06.162
Can you build it?

01:20:08.668 --> 01:20:11.228
- Excuse me?
- Can you build a movie house for me?

01:20:11.304 --> 01:20:15.104
My advisors cannot disapprove,
and you will be well paid.

01:20:15.175 --> 01:20:18.372
And you will have to come here every day
to build it, every single day.

01:20:18.445 --> 01:20:22.677
When you are here, you'll visit me. We
can have conversations on many topics.

01:20:22.749 --> 01:20:25.411
I would like to learn
about the world you come from.

01:20:25.485 --> 01:20:29.251
For example, where is Paris, France?
And what's a Molotov cocktail?

01:20:29.322 --> 01:20:31.085
And who is Jack the Ripper?

01:20:32.425 --> 01:20:34.416
You can tell me many things.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.833
I'm proud to be of service,
Your Holiness.

01:21:05.725 --> 01:21:07.659
What is the problem?

01:21:10.096 --> 01:21:11.324
Worms.

01:21:11.398 --> 01:21:13.889
Please, no more hurting worms.

01:21:13.967 --> 01:21:16.094
- Please.
- Worms?

01:21:16.169 --> 01:21:21.232
In a past life, this innocent worm
could have been your mother.

01:21:21.307 --> 01:21:23.241
Please, no more hurting.

01:21:23.309 --> 01:21:26.244
It's impossible. Please, no more.

01:21:28.214 --> 01:21:30.580
But you see, Tibetans believe...

01:21:30.650 --> 01:21:34.142
all living creatures were
their mothers in a past life.

01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:38.623
So we must show them respect
and repay their kindness.

01:21:38.692 --> 01:21:42.560
And never, never
harm anything that lives.

01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:46.065
You can't ask a devout people
to disregard a precious teaching.

01:21:46.132 --> 01:21:48.066
Yes, but Your Holiness...

01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:54.301
with true respect,
we can't possibly...

01:21:56.710 --> 01:21:59.440
I'm sorry, but we can't
possibly rescue all the worms...

01:21:59.512 --> 01:22:02.345
not if you want a theater
finished in this lifetime.

01:22:02.415 --> 01:22:05.680
You have a clever mind.
Think of a solution.

01:22:05.752 --> 01:22:09.051
And in the meantime, you can
explain to me what is an elevator.

01:22:41.988 --> 01:22:45.685
Antarctica.
That's down below.

01:22:48.228 --> 01:22:49.160
Here.

01:22:51.598 --> 01:22:53.623
Fantastic.

01:22:59.239 --> 01:23:00.672
England.

01:23:03.543 --> 01:23:06.307
Don't look at me for help.

01:23:08.281 --> 01:23:09.714
Here?

01:23:17.490 --> 01:23:18.923
Shift.

01:23:21.161 --> 01:23:24.187
Oh, I know him.
Honk. Hello!

01:23:26.065 --> 01:23:27.089
Turn!

01:23:29.135 --> 01:23:31.069
Brake!

01:24:02.235 --> 01:24:07.138
The robe of a minister is so much finer
than your old brown robe, isn't it?

01:24:08.374 --> 01:24:09.898
Please.

01:24:09.976 --> 01:24:12.206
Everyone, please.

01:24:12.278 --> 01:24:14.610
You must be very clever
to get such a good promotion.

01:24:15.782 --> 01:24:18.216
I did not intend to be
a secretary forever.

01:24:18.284 --> 01:24:20.650
Apparently so.

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:23.450
Well, congratulations.

01:24:37.303 --> 01:24:38.930
Evil omen!

01:24:45.245 --> 01:24:48.476
<i>From his headquarters
in Peking...</i>

01:24:48.548 --> 01:24:51.676
<i>the Chairman, Mao Tse-tung,
was triumphantly proclaimed leader...</i>

01:24:51.751 --> 01:24:53.776
<i>of the new
People's Republic of China.</i>

01:24:56.689 --> 01:25:00.682
<i>Chairman Mao vowed that the first task
of the Communist regime...</i>

01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:03.991
<i>is to reunite
the Chinese motherland.</i>

01:25:04.063 --> 01:25:07.089
<i>He declared that
the remote kingdom of Tibet...</i>

01:25:07.166 --> 01:25:10.192
<i>is an integral part
of the Chinese territory...</i>

01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:12.295
<i>and must join
the great new republic.</i>

01:25:12.372 --> 01:25:14.840
"...and must join
the great new republic."

01:25:14.908 --> 01:25:18.503
People's Republic of China
is advised...

01:25:18.578 --> 01:25:23.743
the government of Tibet
recognizes no foreign sovereign.

01:25:23.816 --> 01:25:26.307
We are an independent nation.

01:25:26.386 --> 01:25:30.083
All the Chinese officials will be
expelled from the borders of Tibet.

01:25:31.024 --> 01:25:32.958
We wish you a happy return
to your homeland.

01:25:33.026 --> 01:25:36.826
Have a safe and pleasant journey
back to China.

01:25:36.896 --> 01:25:40.992
May you have a safe and
pleasant journey back to China.

01:25:42.635 --> 01:25:46.332
We wish you a happy return
to your homeland.

01:25:46.406 --> 01:25:48.772
May you have happiness
and prosperity.

01:25:51.444 --> 01:25:52.877
Let me see.

01:25:54.380 --> 01:26:00.182
You have a very long lifeline,
unlike others here.

01:26:59.045 --> 01:27:02.242
When we are facing the light,
it's day, yes?

01:27:02.315 --> 01:27:04.875
When we are in shadow,
it's night.

01:27:04.951 --> 01:27:08.887
So if the sun is just rising
in Lhasa...

01:27:09.856 --> 01:27:12.654
that means it is just setting...

01:27:12.725 --> 01:27:16.126
in New York City, perhaps.

01:27:16.195 --> 01:27:19.631
That's why it can't be the same time
in every place.

01:27:19.699 --> 01:27:23.635
- Does that answer your question?
- Yes!

01:27:52.598 --> 01:27:54.532
Tell me more.

01:27:56.869 --> 01:27:59.133
What else do you want to know?

01:28:00.506 --> 01:28:04.602
In a few moments, you will be
entering the world of mass media.

01:28:04.677 --> 01:28:07.111
I can hear news
from all over the planet?

01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:10.013
I don't know if they have live
broadcasts from the Tonga Islands...

01:28:10.083 --> 01:28:13.780
but generally speaking, yeah.

01:28:13.853 --> 01:28:16.651
Do you listen to news
from your country?

01:28:16.722 --> 01:28:20.749
From Austria?
No, not really.

01:28:20.827 --> 01:28:22.795
Give me some light, Ku-Dun.

01:28:22.862 --> 01:28:26.525
- Why? It's your home.
- Not anymore it isn't.

01:28:26.599 --> 01:28:29.227
But don't you have
friends and family there?

01:28:29.302 --> 01:28:31.930
A few friends, no family.

01:28:33.639 --> 01:28:35.937
Keep the light steady,
Your Holiness.

01:28:38.144 --> 01:28:40.374
Why? Is everyone dead?

01:28:42.849 --> 01:28:46.250
Do you know there's another sentence
construction aside from the question?

01:28:49.222 --> 01:28:51.554
I was married,
but I'm divorced.

01:28:53.459 --> 01:28:55.017
What did you do?

01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:07.904
I didn't want a child,
so I ran away to climb a mountain.

01:29:07.974 --> 01:29:10.238
You have a child?

01:29:12.345 --> 01:29:15.576
Although I've never seen him.

01:29:16.816 --> 01:29:20.775
All right. Let me show you
how this thing works.

01:29:37.570 --> 01:29:40.437
- Give it all you've got.
- Yes, Mr. Harrer.

01:30:21.881 --> 01:30:23.314
Happy Christmas.

01:30:24.383 --> 01:30:25.816
Thank you.

01:30:37.797 --> 01:30:40.493
- What is this special occasion?
- This is Christmas.

01:30:41.334 --> 01:30:44.599
And this is for you, my friend.
Go on.

01:31:33.252 --> 01:31:35.186
<i>"I found it in a shop
in the Barkhor.</i>

01:31:36.055 --> 01:31:39.650
<i>It has traveled a long way
and finally come back home.</i>

01:31:39.725 --> 01:31:43.183
<i>Thank you for your friendship.
Heinrich. "</i>

01:32:07.219 --> 01:32:09.153
It is incredible.

01:32:12.191 --> 01:32:14.125
Thank you for saving my life.

01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:27.234
<i>... must be liberated
from religious oppressors.</i>

01:32:27.306 --> 01:32:29.240
<i>Tibetans must be reunited...</i>

01:32:29.308 --> 01:32:31.105
<i>- with their brothers and sisters...
- Turn that off.</i>

01:32:31.177 --> 01:32:34.476
<i>- of the great family of new China.
- I'm very sorry.</i>

01:32:34.547 --> 01:32:37.516
<i>Foreigners control
Tibet's corrupt government.</i>

01:32:37.583 --> 01:32:41.986
<i>Our Tibetan comrades must be liberated
from foreign imperialists.</i>

01:32:42.054 --> 01:32:45.080
<i>Tibet's million serfs
must be freed.</i>

01:32:45.157 --> 01:32:48.251
How many foreigners
are there in Tibet?

01:32:48.327 --> 01:32:50.852
You, Heinrich.

01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:52.591
<i>Tibet will be liberated.</i>

01:33:55.961 --> 01:33:59.021
He asked for you, Mr. Harrer.

01:34:13.045 --> 01:34:18.244
They were destroying the village
I was born in, Takster in Amdo.

01:34:18.317 --> 01:34:20.649
It was terrible.

01:34:20.719 --> 01:34:24.314
It was just a dream.
You had a bad dream. That's all.

01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:28.326
But it was so real.
Where did it come from?

01:34:29.595 --> 01:34:33.656
My mind could never imagine
such terrible things.

01:35:16.542 --> 01:35:21.411
I can't sleep.
I'm afraid the dream will come back.

01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:26.743
A couple of insomniacs.

01:35:29.655 --> 01:35:31.247
Tell me a story.

01:35:34.193 --> 01:35:36.491
Tell me a story
about climbing mountains.

01:35:36.562 --> 01:35:41.727
That's one way to fall asleep.
Those stories bore even me.

01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:44.064
Then tell me
what you love about it.

01:35:44.136 --> 01:35:45.569
What...

01:35:48.841 --> 01:35:52.777
The absolute simplicity.
That's what I love.

01:35:53.979 --> 01:35:57.506
When you're climbing,
your mind is clear...

01:35:57.583 --> 01:35:59.915
freed of all confusions.

01:35:59.985 --> 01:36:01.782
You have focus.

01:36:03.289 --> 01:36:06.952
And suddenly
the light becomes sharper...

01:36:07.026 --> 01:36:09.654
sounds are richer...

01:36:09.728 --> 01:36:12.288
and you are filled with...

01:36:12.364 --> 01:36:15.925
the deep, powerful presence of life.

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:24.903
I've only felt that way
one other time.

01:36:24.977 --> 01:36:26.808
When?

01:36:31.517 --> 01:36:33.576
In your presence, Ku-Dun.

01:36:36.055 --> 01:36:38.020
The Chinese have already secured
much of the northern border regions.

01:36:38.055 --> 01:36:39.986
The Chinese have already secured
much of the northern border regions.

01:36:40.059 --> 01:36:43.392
They have ransacked a village,
destroyed the monasteries...

01:36:43.462 --> 01:36:46.226
burnt scriptures
and defaced holy relics.

01:36:46.298 --> 01:36:48.357
We've been told they've
even killed some monks...

01:36:48.434 --> 01:36:51.665
- Which village?
- Takster in Amdo.

01:36:51.737 --> 01:36:54.763
It's where His Holiness was born.

01:37:05.784 --> 01:37:07.217
Go ahead.

01:37:09.622 --> 01:37:12.557
When you were defense minister
to the previous Dalai Lama...

01:37:12.625 --> 01:37:15.116
then you wanted to
reorganize the army.

01:37:15.194 --> 01:37:17.128
Can you do it now?

01:37:17.196 --> 01:37:21.690
The People's Liberation Army
is one million troops strong.

01:37:21.767 --> 01:37:25.294
We have 8,000 men
with 50 pieces of artillery...

01:37:25.371 --> 01:37:27.862
and a few hundred mortars
and machine guns.

01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:29.601
The task is hopeless.

01:37:29.675 --> 01:37:32.166
Then you refuse
the appointment, do you?

01:37:34.913 --> 01:37:37.347
No. I accept it with honor.

01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:41.246
You two gentlemen know about wars.

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:43.720
What type of weapon
do you recommend?

01:37:57.770 --> 01:38:00.330
It seems the Chinese troops are
advancing toward our northern borders.

01:38:00.406 --> 01:38:02.931
Where's His Holiness?

01:38:03.008 --> 01:38:05.033
<i>The glory of
a British coronation.</i>

01:38:05.110 --> 01:38:08.136
<i>Nowhere in the world
is there anything half so wonderful.</i>

01:38:08.213 --> 01:38:11.376
<i>Only once or twice in the life of each
one of us comes such a day as this...</i>

01:38:11.450 --> 01:38:14.112
<i>when we know that we are watching
history in the making...</i>

01:38:14.186 --> 01:38:18.054
<i>when we know that generations to come
will look back on this day...</i>

01:38:18.123 --> 01:38:21.320
<i>for May 12, 1937, will be
one of the dates in history...</i>

01:38:21.393 --> 01:38:24.954
<i>that schoolchildren will learn about
maybe a thousand years from now.</i>

01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:26.622
<i>Every moment
the thrill of excitement...</i>

01:38:26.699 --> 01:38:31.227
Do you think someday people will
look at Tibet on the movie screen...

01:38:31.303 --> 01:38:33.294
and wonder what happened to us?

01:38:33.372 --> 01:38:35.135
<i>The coronation coach moves forward.</i>

01:38:35.207 --> 01:38:37.675
I don't know.

01:38:37.743 --> 01:38:39.836
Don't you have all the answers?

01:38:43.982 --> 01:38:45.950
I don't.

01:38:53.258 --> 01:38:56.921
<i>On the same field where Tibetans
traditionally gathered for picnics...</i>

01:38:56.995 --> 01:38:58.963
<i>ground was cleared
to build an airstrip...</i>

01:38:59.031 --> 01:39:02.523
<i>so that the plane carrying
three Chinese generals could land.</i>

01:39:02.601 --> 01:39:06.196
<i>Nearby, the Tibetan army
practiced its maneuvers.</i>

01:39:06.271 --> 01:39:09.001
<i>Some of the soldiers
wear ancient mesh armor.</i>

01:39:09.074 --> 01:39:12.510
<i>They bring old muskets
and spears as artillery.</i>

01:39:12.578 --> 01:39:18.175
<i>The spectacle of a peace-loving nation,
vainly attempting to create a military.</i>

01:39:18.250 --> 01:39:21.413
<i>The fears of war
on my friends' faces...</i>

01:39:21.487 --> 01:39:26.083
<i>strike a deeply buried
personal chord.</i>

01:39:26.158 --> 01:39:28.854
<i>Echoes of the aggressions
of my own country...</i>

01:39:28.927 --> 01:39:31.919
<i>the will to overpower
weaker peoples...</i>

01:39:31.997 --> 01:39:35.091
<i>bring shame to me.</i>

01:39:35.167 --> 01:39:39.627
<i>I shudder to recall how once long ago
I embraced the same beliefs...</i>

01:39:39.705 --> 01:39:41.764
<i>how at one time I was, in fact...</i>

01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:46.072
<i>no different from
these intolerant Chinese.</i>

01:39:47.813 --> 01:39:50.304
<i>The Tibetans say an enemy
is the greatest teacher...</i>

01:39:50.382 --> 01:39:53.510
<i>because only an enemy can help
develop patience and compassion.</i>

01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:57.487
<i>They believe with rock-like faith
that the power of their religion...</i>

01:39:57.556 --> 01:40:00.116
<i>will protect them
against these Chinese.</i>

01:40:01.827 --> 01:40:03.954
<i>In preparation for
the generals' visit...</i>

01:40:04.029 --> 01:40:07.123
<i>sacred ceremonies are performed
throughout Lhasa.</i>

01:40:07.199 --> 01:40:12.398
<i>Sculptures of deities have been carved
with great care in butter.</i>

01:40:12.471 --> 01:40:17.170
<i>As the sun melts them, they become
a reminder that nothing lasts.</i>

01:40:30.556 --> 01:40:34.287
<i>The rising star of the cabinet,
Minister Ngawang Jigme...</i>

01:40:34.359 --> 01:40:36.953
<i>made an offering of his own
to greet the Chinese generals...</i>

01:40:37.029 --> 01:40:39.020
<i>and lead them through Lhasa.</i>

01:40:42.167 --> 01:40:45.102
Raising their flag is an honor
the Chinese don't deserve.

01:40:45.170 --> 01:40:48.697
When you are not strong enough to fight,
you should embrace your enemy.

01:40:48.774 --> 01:40:51.971
With both arms around you,
he cannot point a gun at you.

01:40:52.044 --> 01:40:55.536
Nothing in politics
is a matter of honor, my friend.

01:42:00.913 --> 01:42:05.543
History repeats itself,
even in paradise.

01:42:07.019 --> 01:42:10.477
General, we shall have
our audience with His...

01:42:35.814 --> 01:42:40.274
General, the monks have been making
this mandala of sand for many days.

01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:44.118
It is a symbol of
enlightenment and peace.

01:42:44.189 --> 01:42:45.520
General!

01:42:57.869 --> 01:43:01.532
We do not sit lower than he does.

01:43:01.606 --> 01:43:03.767
But, General,
it is our custom.

01:43:04.376 --> 01:43:06.310
I can sit down there.

01:43:23.195 --> 01:43:25.925
Your Holiness,
this is General Chang Jing Wu...

01:43:25.998 --> 01:43:29.331
General Than Gua,
General Than Gua San.

01:43:29.401 --> 01:43:32.234
They wish to have
an audience with you.

01:43:33.672 --> 01:43:36.971
May you have happiness
and prosperity.

01:43:38.477 --> 01:43:43.176
They are promising regional autonomy
and religious freedom...

01:43:43.248 --> 01:43:48.185
if Tibet accepts that China
be its political master.

01:43:50.489 --> 01:43:56.121
Until I attain my majority, the
regent is the political leader of Tibet.

01:43:56.194 --> 01:43:58.628
You should have requested
an audience with him...

01:43:58.697 --> 01:44:00.722
to discuss these important matters
of the world.

01:44:02.567 --> 01:44:06.003
My experience of such things
is limited.

01:44:07.572 --> 01:44:10.166
I am a simple Buddhist monk.

01:44:10.242 --> 01:44:14.872
All I know is the scripture
and the words of Lord Buddha.

01:44:14.946 --> 01:44:20.111
He said, "All beings tremble
before danger and death.

01:44:20.185 --> 01:44:22.153
Life is dear to all.

01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:27.157
When a man considers this,
he does not kill or cause to kill."

01:44:27.225 --> 01:44:28.817
You must understand.

01:44:28.894 --> 01:44:33.661
These words are ingrained
in the heart of every Tibetan.

01:44:33.732 --> 01:44:39.170
It is why we are a peaceful people
who reject violence on principle.

01:44:40.772 --> 01:44:45.209
I pray you will see this is
our greatest strength...

01:44:45.277 --> 01:44:47.575
not our weakness.

01:44:48.647 --> 01:44:51.115
I thank you for your visit.

01:44:53.952 --> 01:44:57.115
An offering
to the Enlightened Ones.

01:45:12.104 --> 01:45:15.073
Religion is poison.

01:46:22.507 --> 01:46:25.874
The Chinese have attacked
the Tibetan frontier near Den-Go.

01:46:38.557 --> 01:46:42.721
"Today at the dawn, 84,000 troops
of the 1st and 2nd Field Armies...

01:46:42.794 --> 01:46:47.231
under the overall command
of General Chang Jing Wu...

01:46:47.299 --> 01:46:50.928
attacked the Tibetan frontier
near Den-Go.

01:46:51.002 --> 01:46:54.961
The Tibetan army believes
an attack on Chamdo is imminent.

01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:58.009
<i>Ngawang Jigme,
our newly appointed governor...</i>

01:46:58.076 --> 01:47:00.340
<i>is preparing to send troops
toward the Chinese column...</i>

01:47:00.412 --> 01:47:03.279
<i>in order to stop
their progression. "</i>

01:47:04.449 --> 01:47:08.180
As you know, Chamdo
is the gateway to Tibet.

01:47:08.253 --> 01:47:11.051
If Chamdo falls,
the whole of Tibet will fall.

01:47:11.122 --> 01:47:14.387
If I did not know that, I would not
have been appointed governor.

01:47:14.459 --> 01:47:19.988
You do realize our troops are committed
to fighting the Chinese to the last man.

01:47:20.065 --> 01:47:22.158
<i>They would rather die than surrender.</i>

01:47:24.002 --> 01:47:28.666
Rest assured, there will be no surrender
as long as I am in Chamdo.

01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:54.109
Radio Lhasa.

01:50:55.180 --> 01:50:57.341
Now.

01:50:57.415 --> 01:51:00.248
We request permission
to surrender.

01:51:00.318 --> 01:51:03.253
- But there will be no surrender...
- I said, "Radio Lhasa."

01:51:03.321 --> 01:51:06.051
Permission to surrender now.

01:51:52.537 --> 01:51:56.166
<i>We lost the war in 11 days,
Heinrich.</i>

01:51:56.241 --> 01:51:58.903
<i>This surrender is
our death sentence.</i>

01:52:00.245 --> 01:52:05.740
<i>And I'm afraid our friend
Ngawang Jigme has issued it.</i>

01:52:05.817 --> 01:52:11.187
<i>He abandoned Chamdo and then
destroyed the ammunition dumps.</i>

01:52:12.457 --> 01:52:15.756
Without weapons and ammunition...

01:52:15.827 --> 01:52:18.762
there was no hope for
the troops who wanted to fight.

01:52:20.098 --> 01:52:23.431
<i>Our guerrillas could have held
the mountain passes for months...</i>

01:52:24.335 --> 01:52:26.200
<i>even years.</i>

01:52:26.271 --> 01:52:31.265
<i>It would have bought us time to make
appeals for help to other nations.</i>

01:52:31.342 --> 01:52:33.708
<i>Now it's lost.</i>

01:52:33.778 --> 01:52:35.973
<i>They broke down the gates.</i>

01:53:24.362 --> 01:53:26.455
Hello, my friend.

01:53:33.371 --> 01:53:35.305
We did what was the best
for our country...

01:53:36.407 --> 01:53:38.341
for Tibet.

01:53:39.577 --> 01:53:43.980
On the way to Lhasa, I would see
Tibetans wearing these jackets.

01:53:44.048 --> 01:53:46.209
"Chinese soldiers.
Very nice.

01:53:46.284 --> 01:53:50.812
Give food, clothes, money.
Very nice."

01:53:50.888 --> 01:53:54.517
It's strange to me that something
so harmless as a jacket...

01:53:54.592 --> 01:53:58.494
could symbolize
such a great lie.

01:54:03.001 --> 01:54:05.731
After all these years, you still
do not understand Tibetan ways.

01:54:06.971 --> 01:54:10.532
To return a gift is unforgivable.

01:54:13.578 --> 01:54:17.014
A man who betrays his culture
should not preach about its customs.

01:54:23.855 --> 01:54:26.790
There was a time
I would have wished you dead...

01:54:26.858 --> 01:54:29.053
but your shame
will be your torture.

01:54:29.127 --> 01:54:32.563
And your torture
will be your life.

01:54:32.630 --> 01:54:34.962
I wish it to be long.

01:54:46.744 --> 01:54:49.542
We pray that His Holiness,
the Dalai Lama...

01:54:49.614 --> 01:54:53.516
will be granted the power
to unify his people.

01:54:53.584 --> 01:54:58.521
We humbly ask the Tibetan government
to honor our request...

01:54:58.589 --> 01:55:02.753
and let the Dalai Lama
attain his political majority.

01:55:57.348 --> 01:56:00.283
You have the entire palace
in a panic.

01:56:02.253 --> 01:56:04.983
I'm hiding from the world
for a day.

01:56:08.059 --> 01:56:10.823
Kind of difficult
in a glasshouse, no?

01:56:16.601 --> 01:56:18.899
<i>It's The Moonlight...</i>

01:56:18.970 --> 01:56:20.961
by Debussy.

01:56:23.741 --> 01:56:27.074
What else do you know
about this song?

01:58:05.343 --> 01:58:06.626
Him, him and him.

01:58:06.661 --> 01:58:07.909
Him, him and him.

01:58:20.758 --> 01:58:24.660
I hope you've received your invitation
to the enthronement ceremony.

01:58:24.729 --> 01:58:25.991
Yes. Thank you.

01:58:26.063 --> 01:58:28.793
- It's next week.
- Thank you.

01:58:42.413 --> 01:58:45.439
Do I look like an egghead?

01:58:45.516 --> 01:58:47.711
No, they suit you.

01:58:50.087 --> 01:58:52.521
We have a saying in Tibet...

01:58:52.590 --> 01:58:57.152
"If the problem can be solved,
there is no use worrying about it.

01:58:57.228 --> 01:59:00.095
If it can't be solved,
worrying will do no good."

01:59:01.399 --> 01:59:02.889
So stop worrying.

01:59:04.335 --> 01:59:08.829
You have to leave Tibet.
Your life's at great risk.

01:59:10.441 --> 01:59:15.208
Forgive my presumption, but I made
arrangements to get you out safely.

01:59:15.279 --> 01:59:18.942
We should leave after the enthronement.
The Chinese would never expect it...

01:59:19.016 --> 01:59:24.249
How can I help people if I run away from
them? What kind of leader would I be?

01:59:26.123 --> 01:59:28.421
I have to stay here.

01:59:28.492 --> 01:59:30.858
Serving others
is my path to liberation.

01:59:41.739 --> 01:59:44.731
- Then I don't go either.
- Why not?

01:59:44.809 --> 01:59:47.972
Because you are my path
to liberation.

01:59:50.181 --> 01:59:55.346
The Buddha said, "Salvation
does not come from the sight of me.

01:59:55.419 --> 01:59:59.048
It demands strenuous effort
and practice.

01:59:59.123 --> 02:00:03.958
So work hard and seek
your own salvation diligently."

02:00:06.497 --> 02:00:08.795
I am not your son...

02:00:10.301 --> 02:00:13.099
and I never thought of you
as my father.

02:00:14.271 --> 02:00:17.297
You were much too informal
with me for that.

02:00:28.486 --> 02:00:30.977
Do you ever think about him?

02:00:45.069 --> 02:00:47.469
And what do you think about?

02:00:58.749 --> 02:01:02.651
It's not the conscious thought
really.

02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:05.154
It's just always there.

02:01:13.564 --> 02:01:16.829
When I crossed Tibet,
he was with me.

02:01:16.901 --> 02:01:19.233
When I came to Lhasa,
he was with me.

02:01:19.303 --> 02:01:21.567
When I sit beside you,
he's...

02:01:23.541 --> 02:01:25.532
there with me.

02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:34.010
I can't even imagine how I pictured
the world without him in it.

02:01:36.987 --> 02:01:40.184
Then you should go home
and be his father.

02:01:47.398 --> 02:01:49.229
I know.

02:01:51.102 --> 02:01:53.866
You have finished
your job with me.

02:01:56.841 --> 02:01:58.968
But you have to stay
for my enthronement.

02:01:59.043 --> 02:02:02.604
I want you to see me
in all my pomp and glory.

02:02:05.683 --> 02:02:07.810
It'd be a pleasure, my friend.

02:03:26.463 --> 02:03:28.624
From the government of Tibet...

02:03:28.699 --> 02:03:31.293
to Your Holiness,
the fourteenth Dalai Lama...

02:03:31.368 --> 02:03:33.302
we ask you to rule your people...

02:03:33.370 --> 02:03:38.137
as the spiritual and
temporal leader of Tibet.

02:03:43.781 --> 02:03:48.081
By your prayers and wishes,
I humbly accept.

02:04:43.741 --> 02:04:46.574
Butter tea.
It was never my cup of tea.

02:04:50.047 --> 02:04:54.143
- One was enough.
- Yes, we must follow the custom.

02:04:54.218 --> 02:04:59.019
A fresh cup of tea is poured
for the loved one departing.

02:05:03.894 --> 02:05:08.160
It sits untouched,
waiting for his return.

02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:13.592
May all travelers find happiness
wherever they go.

02:06:13.664 --> 02:06:18.863
Without any effort may they accomplish
whatever they set out to do.

02:06:18.936 --> 02:06:22.133
And having safely
returned to the shore...

02:06:22.206 --> 02:06:26.973
may they be joyfully reunited
with their relatives.

02:06:38.689 --> 02:06:40.156
Mr. Harrer...

02:06:44.061 --> 02:06:45.494
from His Holiness.

02:08:18.388 --> 02:08:20.913
- Hello, Horst.
- Hello, Heinrich.

02:08:20.991 --> 02:08:24.722
Rolf, come out to meet him.

02:08:24.795 --> 02:08:27.730
No, I don't want to.

02:08:29.399 --> 02:08:30.832
May I?

02:10:10.601 --> 02:10:13.399
Rolf, take your time.

02:10:30.354 --> 02:10:32.379
Well done, son.

02:10:33.457 --> 02:10:34.890
Well done.
