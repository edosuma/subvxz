WEBVTT

00:06.441 --> 00:08.878
- Where is the money, Tara?
- What money?

00:08.921 --> 00:10.836
No!

00:10.880 --> 00:12.664
- Enter the access key!

00:13.839 --> 00:15.145
- Nolan, it's Tara Coleman.

00:15.189 --> 00:17.495
Tell me what you know
about Treadstone.

00:17.539 --> 00:20.498
- Ask me again if you're
ever passing through Moscow.

00:20.542 --> 00:23.327
- What are you planning
on doing with Stiletto Six?

00:23.371 --> 00:24.850
- That is not your concern.

00:24.894 --> 00:26.939
- Are you selling the missile?
- Petrushka--

00:26.983 --> 00:28.376
- I deserve to know.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.856
- A group of North Koreans
are purchasing it.

00:38.081 --> 00:40.779
- That's the woman
who woke you up?

00:40.823 --> 00:42.390
- This is a rogue agent

00:42.433 --> 00:44.609
helping a psychopathic killer
escape the authorities,

00:44.653 --> 00:47.047
and none of it
is agency sanctioned.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.744
This ends now!

01:07.589 --> 01:09.373
- I ran into some people
from Treadstone.

01:09.417 --> 01:10.853
I overheard them talking.

01:10.896 --> 01:13.290
They're sending a team
to our house.

01:13.334 --> 01:14.726
And they're planning
on killing

01:14.770 --> 01:16.293
some guy named
Marcus Sachs tonight.

01:16.337 --> 01:17.729
They're sending another asset.

01:17.773 --> 01:19.949
They're gonna murder him
and his wife.

01:19.992 --> 01:21.298
We need to help him, Sam.

01:21.342 --> 01:23.605
We got to do something.

01:41.449 --> 01:44.365
Oh.

01:44.408 --> 01:48.586
- Marcus?
- My wife.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.110
- He's using your wife
as a trap.

01:50.153 --> 01:51.372
- Who?

01:51.415 --> 01:53.069
- The man sent here
to kill you.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.331
- I need to see my wife!
- Hey.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.116
That's exactly
what he wants you to do.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.595
Trust me.
Listen.

01:57.639 --> 02:01.077
Get back behind that corner,
stay low, avoid the windows.

02:01.121 --> 02:04.124
Hey, move, please.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.256
Okay?

02:25.493 --> 02:27.451
Hey, listen,
we got you, all right?

02:27.495 --> 02:29.888
Just shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

03:24.856 --> 03:27.076
- Vincent, please.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.488
- It's okay.
It's okay.

04:56.644 --> 04:59.342
- Sam?

04:59.386 --> 05:01.213
- They're both dead.

05:05.392 --> 05:08.786
This is where both of us
are gonna end up...

05:08.830 --> 05:12.486
just two bodies
lying on the floor somewhere.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.488
I don't want you to die
in my arms.

05:14.531 --> 05:16.446
- Okay, listen,
let's keep moving.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.274
- We can't move fast enough.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.972
That guy you followed,
he's gonna let Treadstone know

05:21.016 --> 05:24.019
that you're alive,
and they're gonna find us.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.679
Doug.

05:34.682 --> 05:38.120
- It's gonna sound crazy,
but hear me out.

05:39.208 --> 05:42.994
He's my height. He's my weight.
Complexion's close enough.

05:43.038 --> 05:45.040
Sam, I can pass as him.

05:50.088 --> 05:52.134
- Yeah, I mean, if you shave
and cut your hair, but--wait.

05:52.177 --> 05:55.050
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
this is insane.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.230
But sure, if--I mean,
if they think you're dead,

06:01.273 --> 06:03.058
it will buy us time.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.842
- I'll code in as Vincent.

06:04.886 --> 06:09.020
Let's see if we can access his
phone using facial recognition.

06:11.893 --> 06:14.635
- Okay.

06:14.678 --> 06:16.985
We tell 'em the target's down.

06:22.207 --> 06:25.080
We tell 'em I'm down, too.

06:25.123 --> 06:27.561
- And then you're Vincent?

06:27.604 --> 06:29.867
- Send it in.

06:40.487 --> 06:44.404
It's an order
to destroy your body.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.581
- Let's do it.

08:13.362 --> 08:16.104
- Yuri.

08:47.962 --> 08:51.052
- I put my best men on the job.

08:51.095 --> 08:52.836
- Then...

10:10.479 --> 10:13.221
- Tell Nolan
Tara Coleman is here.

10:13.264 --> 10:16.616
- Tara Coleman.

10:34.938 --> 10:37.637
- Hey, Tara.

10:38.768 --> 10:41.162
- I need your help.

10:43.077 --> 10:44.818
What is this?

10:44.861 --> 10:45.949
- Oh, we're harvesting footage

10:45.993 --> 10:48.082
from a Pakistani
Air Force drone.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.692
- For who?

10:49.736 --> 10:51.868
- Corporate clients thinking
about investing heavily

10:51.912 --> 10:53.261
in Karachi.

10:53.304 --> 10:55.219
- Tell me about Treadstone.

10:55.263 --> 10:56.917
- Huh, nice to see you, too.

10:56.960 --> 11:00.877
I just watched a mercenary
hold a gun to Meghan's head

11:00.921 --> 11:02.662
and pull the trigger.

11:05.316 --> 11:09.756
We both know she'd want us
to keep pushing ahead.

11:09.799 --> 11:11.453
- What does that entail?

11:11.496 --> 11:13.455
- Getting answers.
- Answers about what?

11:13.498 --> 11:14.935
- Treadstone, Stiletto Six,

11:14.978 --> 11:16.632
Yuri Leniov,
the North Koreans--

11:16.676 --> 11:18.721
- We could get killed for just
having this conversation.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.288
Slow down.

11:20.331 --> 11:22.333
- My moves are only as good
as the information that I have,

11:22.377 --> 11:23.683
and I need more of it.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.293
- That's not a plan.

11:25.336 --> 11:28.600
- Did you have a plan when you
leaked the Crypt 4 story to me?

11:31.038 --> 11:33.301
- Do you remember Blackbriar?

11:33.344 --> 11:35.042
- The CIA black ops unit

11:35.085 --> 11:36.696
that got exposed
in the press years ago.

11:36.739 --> 11:39.133
- Blackbriar was part
of Treadstone.

11:39.176 --> 11:41.962
At first, I thought it was some
kind of assassination program,

11:42.005 --> 11:43.485
but it's deeper than that.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.966
They deal with human
performance and enhancement.

11:46.009 --> 11:50.274
I'm talking about the next wave
of military operations.

11:50.318 --> 11:53.408
- And tell me
about Yuri Leniov.

11:54.931 --> 11:57.934
I will never let this
come back on you, Nolan.

12:03.505 --> 12:05.463
- All right, listen up.

12:06.595 --> 12:09.337
Get me everything
on Yuri Leniov.

12:18.825 --> 12:22.524
- We got about an hour
before the CIA tracks us down.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.700
- I'm working on a plan.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.312
- You need to turn me in.

12:28.356 --> 12:30.358
- No.

12:30.401 --> 12:32.186
- You have to, Edwards.

12:32.229 --> 12:34.057
Make them think
you're cooperating.

12:34.101 --> 12:37.017
- In their eyes,
I'm aiding a killer.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.670
They want both of us dead.

12:38.714 --> 12:42.674
- Okay, cut a deal with them,
then--your life for mine.

12:45.112 --> 12:46.722
- I won't do that to you.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.811
- You said you want to know
who's waking us up.

12:48.855 --> 12:51.205
- I do.
- Then you have to keep going

12:51.248 --> 12:52.684
without me.

12:52.728 --> 12:56.427
- We'll figure this out.

12:56.471 --> 12:58.865
Look,
you did your part, okay?

12:58.908 --> 13:03.130
You gave me the chance
to see my daughter.

13:03.173 --> 13:05.610
And I'm good.

13:16.099 --> 13:18.406
- I need to go back
to Treadstone.

13:18.449 --> 13:19.842
- What?

13:19.886 --> 13:21.235
- I'm gonna reach out to them
and find out

13:21.278 --> 13:24.107
what the hell
is going on.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.897
- They will
fucking kill you, Sam.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.159
- No, no, they know me.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.769
They'll want to
hear me out first.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.772
- What are you gonna tell them?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.165
- I don't know.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.428
I'll tell 'em that
you disappeared on me

13:40.471 --> 13:42.430
three days ago
and that I'm fucking scared.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.127
I'll tell them
that I made a mistake,

13:44.171 --> 13:45.607
I'm sorry,
I want to make things right.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.783
I'll improvise.
- No, this is too dangerous.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.525
- Don't you want to find out
what the fuck is going on?

13:58.576 --> 14:01.014
- When does this end?

14:06.497 --> 14:10.023
- It just has to end
when we know that we're safe.

14:11.502 --> 14:15.593
And it ends
when we're back together.

14:19.336 --> 14:21.295
- I saw a quarry
on the way over here.

14:21.338 --> 14:23.732
We can drop Vincent
there, okay?

14:25.255 --> 14:27.954
- Yeah, okay.

14:33.350 --> 14:35.091
- So, like most ex-KGB guys

14:35.135 --> 14:37.050
who got rich
after the Cold War,

14:37.093 --> 14:40.096
Yuri had most of his files
sealed or destroyed.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.837
- It says here he worked

14:41.881 --> 14:43.839
on the Stiletto Six
missile program.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.103
Almost everyone else who worked
on it with him is dead.

14:47.147 --> 14:49.758
- This guy Max Schneider--
he was found dead

14:49.801 --> 14:50.846
just a couple days ago.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.935
FSB called it a suicide.

14:52.979 --> 14:55.155
Slashed his own wrists open
in the bathroom.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.766
He was one of Yuri's
investment partners

14:57.809 --> 14:59.811
dating back to the 1990s.

14:59.855 --> 15:01.813
- What else did Yuri and Max
work on together

15:01.857 --> 15:03.728
whilst they were
in the KGB?

15:03.772 --> 15:05.556
- Something called Cicada.

15:07.602 --> 15:09.865
- General Kwon in London...

15:09.909 --> 15:13.086
he said,
"They're waking people up.

15:13.129 --> 15:15.827
The cicadas--
it's starting again."

15:15.871 --> 15:18.526
- Cicada's analog.
- Meaning?

15:18.569 --> 15:21.964
- It's an older physical file.
It was never digitized.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.400
- I need to see it.

15:23.444 --> 15:25.054
Kwon mentioned Cicada
and was leading me

15:25.098 --> 15:28.144
to Stiletto Six--
there's a connection.

15:28.188 --> 15:30.233
- It's in the RGVA--

15:30.277 --> 15:32.496
Russian State Military Archive.

15:32.540 --> 15:37.588
And it was opened
for academic research in 1990.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.069
- Do you know
where it's located?

15:40.113 --> 15:41.636
- Oh, it says here

15:41.679 --> 15:44.508
the file's stored
in an access-restricted room.

15:44.552 --> 15:47.250
- If you can harvest
Pakistani drone footage,

15:47.294 --> 15:48.991
you can get me credentials.

15:57.869 --> 16:00.960
- Special Activities will have
a unit waiting to intercept us.

16:01.003 --> 16:03.353
I told you they want
us both dead.

16:03.397 --> 16:05.181
- Edwards...

16:05.225 --> 16:06.966
trust me.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.711
- They're heading west
on Anderson Highway

16:13.755 --> 16:16.453
at 52 miles an hour.

16:16.497 --> 16:20.283
- Target will make contact
with Alpha Team in 30 seconds.

16:21.719 --> 16:23.199
- Hive, this is Alpha One.

16:23.243 --> 16:25.941
Be advised,
we have visual on the target.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.682
- Clear copy, Alpha One.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.817
- Confirm weapons free.

16:37.518 --> 16:39.781
Repeat, confirm weapons free.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.049
- There has to be
another way, Dan.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.746
- Haynes has killed
seven people.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.096
- Edwards is still one of ours.

16:50.139 --> 16:51.706
- Are you willing to bet
our careers on it?

16:51.749 --> 16:53.708
Testify to that in front
of a fucking Senate committee?

16:53.751 --> 16:57.016
- Alpha One to Hive.
We have a visual on the target.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.061
Please confirm weapons free.

16:59.105 --> 17:02.934
Permission to engage.

17:02.978 --> 17:05.459
- No, I'm not doing this.

17:07.983 --> 17:11.595
- This is Hive,
weapons are free.

17:11.639 --> 17:13.510
- Confirmed.

17:22.824 --> 17:24.608
- We're in their range.

17:35.228 --> 17:37.012
- Right there, break left!

17:43.018 --> 17:45.107
- Alpha Team has lost visual.

17:46.978 --> 17:49.633
- Switching satellite imager
to FLIR.

17:49.677 --> 17:53.202
- What's Alpha Team's position?
- 100 yards out.

18:08.217 --> 18:10.132
- We have a problem.
- What is it?

18:10.176 --> 18:11.873
- There's only one man
in that car.

18:11.916 --> 18:13.918
- Jesus Christ.

18:13.962 --> 18:17.139
- Let me see your hands!

18:20.186 --> 18:23.014
- Where the hell is
Stephen Haynes?

18:23.058 --> 18:24.364
- We have visual
on Matt Edwards.

18:24.407 --> 18:28.672
- We need eyes on Haynes!
Haynes is gone.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.546
It's Matt Edwards.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.548
- All right, route it
through our audio.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.900
- Matt?
- I want to come in.

18:38.943 --> 18:42.164
- Then why did you run?
- I know the mission directive.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.557
I was running with Alpha Team

18:43.600 --> 18:45.515
when Blackbriar blew up,
remember?

18:45.559 --> 18:48.257
I know they're here to kill us.
Who authorized this--Levine?

18:48.301 --> 18:50.041
- Oh, you got it
all wrong, Matt.

18:50.085 --> 18:51.782
- If anything happens to me,

18:51.826 --> 18:54.045
Haynes is gonna turn this place
into a fucking slaughterhouse.

18:54.089 --> 18:57.484
- We can discuss this, Matt.

18:57.527 --> 19:00.356
- Instruct Alpha One
to take the shot.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.185
- You give me 30 seconds
to talk this through.

19:03.229 --> 19:04.665
- Haynes is posted up

19:04.708 --> 19:07.363
with my AR-15 and 200 rounds
of ammunition.

19:07.407 --> 19:11.759
- Get me a fucking
heat signature on Haynes.

19:11.802 --> 19:13.717
- There is no signature
for him, sir.

19:13.761 --> 19:16.111
- How is that possible?

19:17.025 --> 19:18.374
Edwards could be bluffing.

19:18.418 --> 19:22.073
Haynes might be
long gone by now.

19:22.117 --> 19:23.466
- Matt...

19:23.510 --> 19:25.773
I need proof
that Haynes is on site.

19:31.474 --> 19:35.565
- Hive, we're under fire.
Unknown shooter.

19:37.437 --> 19:38.960
Where's the shooter?

19:39.003 --> 19:41.092
- He could be using
a reflective blanket.

19:41.136 --> 19:42.833
- God damn it.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.109
- What's it gonna be, Ellen?

20:04.290 --> 20:06.248
- Do what he says.

20:11.253 --> 20:13.299
- Matt, I'll see you soon.

20:17.781 --> 20:21.481
- Come on out
with your hands up.

20:21.524 --> 20:24.223
Hive, we have the shooter.

20:31.360 --> 20:34.276
Hold it there.

20:35.364 --> 20:38.193
- Put your weapon
on the ground!

20:38.237 --> 20:39.629
Now!

20:48.464 --> 20:51.772
- On the ground.

20:51.815 --> 20:54.383
- That's affirmative,
Alpha Team leader.

20:54.427 --> 20:57.212
Edwards and Haynes--
both in custody.

21:02.696 --> 21:04.306
- Alpha,
what is their proximity

21:04.350 --> 21:05.829
to your current position?

21:09.877 --> 21:11.313
- Uh, two klicks.

22:00.362 --> 22:03.931
- You will get the first bite,
as agreed.

22:03.974 --> 22:08.501
- The warhead is already
en route to Cyprus.

22:14.985 --> 22:16.770
- Who the hell is that?

22:37.399 --> 22:38.400
- Aah!

24:01.657 --> 24:04.617
- Aah! Aah!

24:33.341 --> 24:35.517
- Turn off the cameras.
- Matt.

24:35.561 --> 24:38.433
- I don't trust anyone
in this place.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.697
All that footage will do
is put a target on our backs.

25:00.150 --> 25:02.631
- And when did you
stop trusting me?

25:02.675 --> 25:05.460
- Around the same time
you issued a kill order

25:05.504 --> 25:08.289
on Stephen Haynes.

25:08.332 --> 25:10.683
That was an execution, Ellen.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.380
- I was justified.

25:12.423 --> 25:15.122
- He signed over his life
to this place.

25:15.165 --> 25:16.558
He let them erase everything

25:16.602 --> 25:18.473
that might have gotten
in the way of his service.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.344
I think he deserved
more than a bullet.

25:20.388 --> 25:22.129
- He killed seven people.

25:22.172 --> 25:25.480
- Don't you want to know why?
- Of course I want to know why.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.351
- You're too busy
thinking about optics

25:27.395 --> 25:28.614
and running risk analysis.

25:28.657 --> 25:30.267
- How dare you?

25:30.311 --> 25:32.095
- You're protecting yourself.

25:32.139 --> 25:35.185
- No, I was protecting you
today, Matt.

25:35.229 --> 25:38.711
- Haynes could have helped us.

25:38.754 --> 25:39.973
- I have a family.

25:40.016 --> 25:41.496
- You think they'd
want to see you

25:41.540 --> 25:43.367
covering up mistakes
for the CIA?

25:43.411 --> 25:45.631
- I think they want to see me
stay out of fucking prison,

25:45.674 --> 25:47.154
is what I think.

25:47.197 --> 25:50.723
I'm the one who signed off
on this operation.

25:50.766 --> 25:52.289
I am the one who gave you

25:52.333 --> 25:54.335
the freedom to go out
and investigate,

25:54.378 --> 25:57.381
and I got a trail
of fucking bodies in return.

25:58.426 --> 26:02.082
You went dark, and you
left me holding the bag.

26:04.214 --> 26:05.868
And let me tell you
something--

26:05.912 --> 26:07.957
if this goes public...

26:08.001 --> 26:10.220
it's me that's gonna burn.

26:11.874 --> 26:14.573
- Who woke up Haynes?

26:14.616 --> 26:15.661
- I don't know.

26:15.704 --> 26:17.706
- Why did he kill
an ExPo whistle-blower

26:17.750 --> 26:19.186
in that store?

26:19.229 --> 26:21.536
Who was the agency woman
in the photo I sent you?

26:21.580 --> 26:25.105
What's her connection
to all of this?

26:36.595 --> 26:38.292
- Go home, Matt.

27:41.964 --> 27:44.575
God damn it, Ellen.

27:49.276 --> 27:51.495
- He's locked out, sir.

27:51.539 --> 27:54.107
- Get me a full surveillance
package on Matt Edwards

27:54.150 --> 27:55.848
effective immediately.

27:55.891 --> 27:57.632
- Yes, sir.

28:11.515 --> 28:14.823
- All right everyone,
she's in the lobby.

28:36.192 --> 28:38.629
- What's the holdup?
- Her ID card should be clear.

28:38.673 --> 28:41.763
- Well, it's not. Hurry up.

28:44.984 --> 28:47.334
- Don't give it to him.
He'll know it's fake.

28:49.031 --> 28:50.772
- I'm trying
a different packet.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.208
- Try faster.

29:23.849 --> 29:26.677
- Okay, so, remember,
you're a visiting professor

29:26.721 --> 29:29.158
researching Cold War tariffs.

29:56.751 --> 29:59.580
- Okay, so you're gonna go
straight and up the stairs

29:59.623 --> 30:04.106
in three, two, one, now.

30:25.084 --> 30:27.216
Okay, so, when you're
at the top of the stairs,

30:27.260 --> 30:29.436
you're gonna take your left...

30:29.479 --> 30:32.569
and around, keep going,

30:32.613 --> 30:34.789
going, and stop.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.967
Okay, Row R, shelf 44.

30:46.235 --> 30:47.802
- Okay.

30:50.631 --> 30:52.285
- Start uploading images.

31:03.470 --> 31:05.254
Okay, now hold still.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.910
There's a guard
right under you.

31:19.529 --> 31:20.922
Okay, clear.

31:21.967 --> 31:26.449
Okay, Yuri Leniov was
a KGB major back in the '70s.

31:26.493 --> 31:28.103
He was managing Cicada.

31:28.147 --> 31:30.149
- What was he working on
specifically?

31:30.192 --> 31:31.715
- Any items
with intelligence value

31:31.759 --> 31:33.152
have been blacked out.

31:33.195 --> 31:35.894
All I see are random locations
and names.

31:37.330 --> 31:41.464
- Uh, cross-reference
those Cicada names

31:41.508 --> 31:44.380
against those
on the Stiletto Six program.

31:49.211 --> 31:51.387
- All right, we got a hit.

31:51.431 --> 31:53.563
Sergeant Petra Andropov.

31:55.174 --> 31:57.611
There's a guard coming
in less than ten seconds.

31:57.654 --> 31:59.700
- I'm not done.

31:59.743 --> 32:01.354
- Get out of there.

32:07.882 --> 32:10.624
Five, four,

32:10.667 --> 32:14.845
three, two...

32:14.889 --> 32:16.108
Okay, what do we got?

32:16.151 --> 32:19.067
- Born in Moscow.
December 19, 1951.

32:19.111 --> 32:20.634
- Parents were part
of a farming collective

32:20.677 --> 32:21.678
in St. Petersburg.

32:21.722 --> 32:23.071
That's where she was raised.

32:23.115 --> 32:25.813
- Graduated from
the KGB Academy in 1968,

32:25.856 --> 32:27.075
top of her class.

32:27.119 --> 32:30.165
- Married a civilian
named Oleg Volkov

32:30.209 --> 32:31.514
but kept her maiden name.

32:31.558 --> 32:33.168
- Okay, financials?

32:33.212 --> 32:35.518
- Nothing since 1995.

32:35.562 --> 32:37.216
- No bank accounts,
no credit cards,

32:37.259 --> 32:40.001
no utility bills,
zero digital footprint.

32:40.045 --> 32:42.873
- How is that possible?
- It's not.

32:42.917 --> 32:46.312
Three, two, one, now.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.533
All we know is
that Yuri oversaw

32:50.577 --> 32:53.449
Sergeant Andropov's work
on the Cicadas in the '70s

32:53.493 --> 32:57.018
and the Stiletto Six program
until 1995.

32:57.062 --> 32:59.368
- She was still a sergeant
in 1995?

32:59.412 --> 33:00.630
- Yeah.

33:00.674 --> 33:02.676
- That woman was a rising star
in the KGB,

33:02.719 --> 33:05.418
and for some reason, her career
totally stalled after Cicada.

33:05.461 --> 33:07.986
- It's an anomaly.

33:08.029 --> 33:10.379
- Yuri Leniov is the bookend
to her career.

33:10.423 --> 33:13.252
They have a history.
- Too bad she's a ghost.

33:14.818 --> 33:17.604
- Where's her husband now?

33:22.739 --> 33:25.046
- I have an address for him
in Kursk.

33:25.090 --> 33:26.656
- Give it to me.

33:34.751 --> 33:37.624
- This is the address
on Vincent's driver's license.

33:42.846 --> 33:45.762
- I don't know
if this is gonna work.

33:45.806 --> 33:48.896
- It has to work.
- It's a long shot, Doug.

33:49.940 --> 33:51.768
- You trained this guy,
you know everything about him.

33:51.812 --> 33:53.683
- Yeah, but now I've got
to give you a lifetime

33:53.727 --> 33:57.861
of information before he gets
tasked with another mission.

34:01.213 --> 34:03.563
- I can do this with your help.

34:23.235 --> 34:25.585
- Vincent has a cache
hidden somewhere--

34:25.628 --> 34:27.935
passports, IDs, money.

34:27.978 --> 34:29.676
- Let's find it.

34:29.719 --> 34:31.373
- We made him
an art dealer--

34:31.417 --> 34:33.158
cover for
international flights,

34:33.201 --> 34:35.638
one-man business,
diverse contacts.

34:35.682 --> 34:37.553
- What was his life like?

34:37.597 --> 34:39.686
- Father was Wall Street,
mother was in fashion.

34:39.729 --> 34:42.602
Upper West Side, Dalton,
house in Montauk.

34:42.645 --> 34:44.125
- What the hell's that mean?

34:44.169 --> 34:46.954
- Vincent's cover story was
that he came from money.

34:46.997 --> 34:48.477
- Yeah?

34:48.521 --> 34:49.957
Wife?

34:50.000 --> 34:51.132
- Uh, ex-wife--

34:51.176 --> 34:54.048
married six years,
no kids, former model.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.964
They met at
a Cindy Sherman retrospective.

35:12.066 --> 35:14.024
- Found it

35:15.548 --> 35:17.637
- He was fluent in English,
French, Spanish,

35:17.680 --> 35:21.162
Portuguese, Russian,
Mandarin, and Farsi.

35:21.206 --> 35:24.731
- He spoke eight languages?
- Yeah.

35:26.689 --> 35:28.561
Hey, same as you.

35:28.604 --> 35:31.999
Cicadas spent
their lives undercover.

35:32.042 --> 35:34.871
- If I'm gonna become Vincent,
we better get started.

35:37.352 --> 35:38.658
- Well, he tore his right ACL

35:38.701 --> 35:40.094
during the first month
of training

35:40.138 --> 35:43.053
and always favored it
subconsciously.

35:43.097 --> 35:45.012
- Like this?

35:45.055 --> 35:46.622
- Yeah, good.

35:46.666 --> 35:48.189
- What else?

35:48.233 --> 35:51.192
- Combat medicine,
wilderness survival,

35:51.236 --> 35:52.672
disaster relief.

35:52.715 --> 35:54.369
How to run a tail,
lose a tail,

35:54.413 --> 35:56.328
and pick nine different locks
in less than a minute.

35:56.371 --> 35:58.982
You know the Koran by heart
and the right place to sit

35:59.026 --> 36:01.724
during a tea ceremony
in Szechuan.

36:01.768 --> 36:03.161
He wrote with his left hand

36:03.204 --> 36:05.554
and did everything else
with his right.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.821
Okay, now in Arabic.

36:47.814 --> 36:51.078
- How do I look?

36:53.428 --> 36:55.430
Like him.

38:03.759 --> 38:06.501
- Put your hands
where I can see them!

38:06.545 --> 38:07.850
Do it now!
Don't move!

38:07.894 --> 38:10.244
- This is American soil!
- Stand down!

38:10.288 --> 38:11.463
- Don't move!

38:11.506 --> 38:13.508
- My name is Soyun Pak.

38:13.552 --> 38:15.336
I'm a citizen of North Korea,

38:15.380 --> 38:17.860
and I have urgent information
for the CIA.

38:22.691 --> 38:25.477
- Hey, back off!

38:25.520 --> 38:27.392
She's coming with us.

38:29.394 --> 38:31.265
- Stand down!

38:45.758 --> 38:47.934
- Ma'am, come here.

39:18.181 --> 39:19.531
- Tara?

39:19.574 --> 39:22.534
- It's good to hear your voice.
- Are you okay?

39:22.577 --> 39:25.493
- Well, I've been through a lot
since the last time we talked.

39:25.537 --> 39:27.321
- That makes two of us.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.583
What is this about?

39:28.627 --> 39:30.846
- Yuri Leniov.

39:30.890 --> 39:32.892
His men murdered
my friend Meghan

39:32.935 --> 39:35.242
in Berlin
right in front of my face.

39:35.285 --> 39:36.417
- Jesus.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.637
- He's connected
to Stiletto Six

39:38.680 --> 39:39.812
and an old program called--

39:39.855 --> 39:40.987
- Cicada.

39:41.030 --> 39:42.467
- General Kwon mentioned it.

39:42.510 --> 39:43.772
- I remember.

39:43.816 --> 39:45.774
- It's an old Russian program.

39:45.818 --> 39:47.472
Everyone who worked on it
with him is dead

39:47.515 --> 39:50.083
except for the woman
I'm going to see right now.

39:50.126 --> 39:51.563
- Well, who is she?

39:51.606 --> 39:55.741
- She's a former KGB agent
called Andropov.

39:55.784 --> 39:58.134
- Okay,
find out everything you can

39:58.178 --> 40:00.136
and call me
as soon as you finish.

40:00.180 --> 40:01.529
- I will.

40:27.816 --> 40:31.472
- Sergeant Andropov?

40:31.516 --> 40:32.995
- Who are you?

40:33.039 --> 40:34.388
- My name is Tara Coleman.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.173
I'd to talk to you
about Yuri Leniov.

40:38.653 --> 40:40.525
I'm a journalist.

40:50.839 --> 40:52.798
- Come in.

40:52.841 --> 40:55.017
Let's have some tea.

41:03.983 --> 41:06.507
- ♪ Getting hard to sleep,
blood is in my dreams ♪

41:06.551 --> 41:09.336
♪ Love is killing me,
trying to figure it out ♪

41:12.818 --> 41:15.473
♪ Nothing better to do

41:15.516 --> 41:18.345
♪ I'm still in here
