00:02.458 --> 00:04.883
<i>Ah, relationships.</i>

00:04.908 --> 00:08.266
<i>In college, they're in
a constant state of flux.</i>

00:08.299 --> 00:10.602
<i>If you're lucky enough
to be in a relationship</i>

00:10.627 --> 00:13.227
<i>that's clearly defined,
and you know exactly</i>

00:13.252 --> 00:16.939
<i>where you stand, that's when
everything feels secure.</i>

00:16.973 --> 00:20.476
<i>And sometimes,
even without an official label,</i>

00:20.501 --> 00:22.269
<i>you can still feel secure</i>

00:22.303 --> 00:25.307
<i>as long as you're both on the same page.</i>

00:25.339 --> 00:27.708
<i>But then there are those other times,</i>

00:27.742 --> 00:30.612
<i>when you haven't clearly
defined your relationship</i>

00:30.645 --> 00:33.315
<i>and neither party is on the same page,</i>

00:33.347 --> 00:35.951
<i>which leads to only one thing...</i>

00:35.984 --> 00:37.886
<i>utter confusion.</i>

00:37.918 --> 00:39.821
Thank you, man.

00:41.088 --> 00:42.490
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:42.524 --> 00:44.859
So, uh, the girls are leaving
to go get something to eat,

00:44.893 --> 00:46.460
but I was wondering,

00:46.493 --> 00:49.030
do you just... wanna get out of here?

00:49.063 --> 00:51.499
Maybe go back to your place?

00:51.533 --> 00:52.701
I do wanna do that, yes.

00:52.734 --> 00:53.635
Okay.

00:53.667 --> 00:55.237
Um, but I was thinking

00:55.270 --> 00:56.471
I was just gonna hang back

00:56.503 --> 00:58.005
and kick it
with Vivek and Doug tonight...

00:58.039 --> 01:00.208
if that's cool with you.

01:00.241 --> 01:01.877
Oh.

01:01.910 --> 01:04.012
- Yeah. Of course.
- You sure?

01:04.044 --> 01:06.647
No, no. Very cool. I totally get it.

01:06.681 --> 01:09.051
No problem.

01:09.083 --> 01:11.719
Houston, she's got a problem.

01:47.922 --> 01:51.292
Ana and Aaron are obviously
having an awkward moment.

01:51.326 --> 01:53.628
Now, normally, I'd go in
and rescue my friend

01:53.660 --> 01:55.930
from this mild to excruciating
embarrassment,

01:55.964 --> 01:57.032
but given all the messiness

01:57.065 --> 01:58.767
happening with the girls lately...

01:58.800 --> 02:00.002
We're not friends anymore.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.038
You're just a girl I live with.

02:03.071 --> 02:04.239
I'm not doing this right now.

02:04.271 --> 02:05.740
Why? 'Cause you're doing our professor?

02:07.275 --> 02:10.377
...I've decided to stay
right here in my own lane.

02:10.411 --> 02:12.114
Hey, babe, you want get out of here,

02:12.146 --> 02:14.916
do something fun and different,
just you and me?

02:14.948 --> 02:16.984
Ooh. I guess that's a yes.

02:22.789 --> 02:24.091
Hey, you hungry?

02:24.125 --> 02:26.294
Me and Ana are meeting
Sky and Nomi at the diner.

02:26.327 --> 02:28.430
Uh, we just gonna post up for a minute.

02:28.463 --> 02:31.333
But, I mean, I may be
in the mood for some dessert.

02:31.365 --> 02:33.167
Ooh. I could definitely
go for some dessert.

02:33.201 --> 02:34.436
It's my cheat day.

02:37.138 --> 02:38.673
Oh, you mean [bleep].

02:38.705 --> 02:40.542
- Okay.
- Yeah.

02:42.442 --> 02:43.511
All right.

02:44.878 --> 02:46.447
Thank you.

02:46.481 --> 02:48.350
Text me when you get home
so I know you made it safe?

02:48.382 --> 02:49.451
- Sure.
- Okay.

02:49.483 --> 02:52.086
- Later, dude.
- Hey.

02:52.120 --> 02:55.524
So, you're kicking it with us
instead of having sex with Ana.

02:55.556 --> 02:57.826
- That feels dumb.
- Uh, I'm sorry.

02:57.858 --> 02:59.426
Am I not allowed to hang out
with the fellas?

02:59.459 --> 03:01.095
Besides, I didn't see Doug go with Jazz.

03:01.128 --> 03:03.164
You saw me give her a kiss goodbye.

03:03.197 --> 03:04.431
You gave homegirl your cheek

03:04.465 --> 03:05.834
like it was your grandma or something.

03:05.866 --> 03:07.602
I'm just saying, that's weird for that

03:07.634 --> 03:09.838
"new new gotta smash phase."
I don't get it.

03:09.870 --> 03:12.673
It's really not that deep, guys.
Don't overread it.

03:12.707 --> 03:14.775
Yeah, but it seems like you not
feeling her like that.

03:14.809 --> 03:16.277
Incorrect, dude.

03:16.311 --> 03:17.779
I'm definitely still feeling her.

03:17.811 --> 03:20.381
It's just that we're on,
I think, two different pages.

03:20.414 --> 03:22.517
You know, I'm in the prologue,
and she's...

03:22.549 --> 03:24.219
Working on the movie adaptation.

03:24.251 --> 03:25.352
Possibly.

03:25.386 --> 03:27.188
Just between us hanging out every night

03:27.221 --> 03:28.455
and her trying to hold my hand...

03:28.489 --> 03:29.524
- Ooh! What?!
- Oh, God. What?

03:29.556 --> 03:31.525
Hold his hand? No.

03:31.559 --> 03:34.295
You cannot just be running up
and grabbing black dudes' hands.

03:34.328 --> 03:35.963
Why is that such a big deal?

03:35.996 --> 03:38.299
Because they just
don't get down like that.

03:38.333 --> 03:39.633
The last time a black man

03:39.667 --> 03:41.469
trusted somebody to take his hand,

03:41.501 --> 03:42.970
we all ended up on ships.

03:43.003 --> 03:46.740
Okay, that is bullshit.
Doug holds my hand all the time.

03:46.774 --> 03:48.076
Where?

03:48.108 --> 03:50.878
On roller coasters, in movie theaters,

03:50.912 --> 03:52.147
in haunted houses,

03:52.180 --> 03:53.815
and at the altar calls during church.

03:53.847 --> 03:57.418
Right. Dark, scary, religious
places where no one can see.

03:57.452 --> 03:59.154
Okay. I got to interject here.

03:59.186 --> 04:01.188
This is not just
a black man thing, okay?

04:01.221 --> 04:02.656
It's an <i> all</i> man thing.

04:02.690 --> 04:04.893
I hold women's hands all the time,

04:04.925 --> 04:06.695
whether they're black, white, Pinay...

04:06.727 --> 04:07.761
Okay.

04:07.794 --> 04:09.663
...Honduran, Russian...

04:09.697 --> 04:11.499
Okay, I definitely don't think
you need to trip

04:11.531 --> 04:13.334
because all the creepin'
around you guys have done,

04:13.368 --> 04:15.002
he's definitely feeling you.

04:15.036 --> 04:18.273
Okay, then why is it that I can
hold his <i> pinga</i> in my hand,

04:18.305 --> 04:19.940
but not his hand in my hand?

04:19.973 --> 04:21.843
Because anybody can hold
a penis in their hand,

04:21.875 --> 04:23.544
but holding a hand in a hand?

04:23.577 --> 04:25.279
That is reserved for "wifey" status.

04:25.312 --> 04:28.550
Have you and Aaron even talked
about being exclusive yet?

04:28.582 --> 04:31.118
Well, no. Not explicitly, but...

04:31.151 --> 04:32.454
Guys, come on.

04:32.486 --> 04:34.455
I assume that after everything
we have been through,

04:34.488 --> 04:36.123
- it's pretty clear.
- Oh, girl.

04:36.156 --> 04:38.192
Do not assume anything ever

04:38.226 --> 04:39.694
when it comes to relationships, okay?

04:39.726 --> 04:42.529
And that, by the way, that's
definitely not just a man thing.

04:42.562 --> 04:44.365
Guys, we text all the time,

04:44.399 --> 04:45.600
we're always together,

04:45.632 --> 04:47.101
and... and we sleep together...

04:47.134 --> 04:48.370
Every night, bro?

04:48.403 --> 04:49.604
- Yeah.
- Peep game.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.473
If you're not hooking up
with other people

04:51.505 --> 04:53.642
and you're regularly
smashing the same person,

04:53.675 --> 04:55.210
you're definitely in a relationship.

04:55.243 --> 04:56.978
What? That is insane, dude.

04:57.010 --> 04:58.545
Tell me why I need to be hooking up

04:58.579 --> 05:00.247
with other girls
to not be in a relationship.

05:00.281 --> 05:01.382
<i>You're</i> insane.

05:01.416 --> 05:02.651
Why are you not hooking up
with other girls?

05:02.683 --> 05:04.885
So many options, so little time.

05:04.918 --> 05:06.154
You know what?

05:06.187 --> 05:08.256
For someone who rubs himself
to sleep every single night,

05:08.288 --> 05:09.990
you sure do have an awful lot
to say about my sex life.

05:10.024 --> 05:11.393
Hey, why do you know
my schedule, though?

05:11.425 --> 05:12.426
Why do you <i> tell</i> me your schedule?

05:12.459 --> 05:13.460
You right.

05:13.493 --> 05:15.229
Yo, real question is,

05:15.262 --> 05:17.498
do you not want to be with Ana, man?

05:17.531 --> 05:19.300
I don't know how to answer that, okay?

05:19.334 --> 05:21.002
I've been with her for like a month.

05:21.034 --> 05:22.236
I don't know what I want.

05:22.269 --> 05:24.271
Bottom line is everything you doing...

05:24.305 --> 05:27.309
the hanging out,
the smashing every night...

05:27.341 --> 05:30.144
that's all signs
of a full-on relationship.

05:30.178 --> 05:31.279
No.

05:31.312 --> 05:32.280
Walks like a duck,
it quacks like a duck,

05:32.312 --> 05:33.914
it bangs like a duck.

05:33.947 --> 05:35.449
Bro, you've wifed up a Cuban duck.

05:35.483 --> 05:36.985
Quack, quack, bitch.

05:37.017 --> 05:39.353
Wow. Look who it is.

05:39.387 --> 05:41.822
Wassup, Aaron?

05:41.856 --> 05:43.457
Hey.

05:43.490 --> 05:46.260
<i>Bears are found on the
continents of North America,</i>

05:46.293 --> 05:48.295
<i>South America, Europe, and Asia.</i>

05:48.329 --> 05:49.698
Mm.

05:49.731 --> 05:52.334
This is your idea
of something fun and different?

05:52.367 --> 05:53.335
We've done this exact thing,

05:53.368 --> 05:56.271
like, three times this week.

05:56.303 --> 05:57.805
I mean, we get it.

05:57.839 --> 06:00.307
The cute, little bear falls,
climbs up a cute, little tree.

06:00.341 --> 06:02.276
The end.

06:02.310 --> 06:06.014
But do you really get it, though?

06:06.046 --> 06:07.981
You need to look closer.

06:08.014 --> 06:10.050
Like, right now, in this elevated state,

06:10.084 --> 06:11.786
I see...

06:11.819 --> 06:13.621
I see so much more.

06:13.654 --> 06:16.725
I see the sunlight
dappling tiny green leaves.

06:16.757 --> 06:19.127
I can see...

06:19.159 --> 06:21.795
triumph over adversity.

06:21.829 --> 06:23.565
Zoey...

06:23.598 --> 06:25.500
this is more, way more,

06:25.533 --> 06:28.069
than a bear climbing a tree.

06:28.101 --> 06:31.072
This is the very meaning of life.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.476
You sound like an insane person.

06:37.010 --> 06:38.545
Mm-hmm.

06:38.579 --> 06:40.848
And I want to get on your level.

06:40.882 --> 06:42.384
Your level can't handle my level.

06:42.416 --> 06:44.485
No, I'm being serious.

06:44.519 --> 06:46.488
I want to get really high.

06:46.521 --> 06:49.424
Like, Luca Jae Hall high.

06:51.192 --> 06:52.560
Copy.

06:55.430 --> 06:56.598
You wanna go on an adventure?

06:56.630 --> 06:59.333
Yes.

07:04.038 --> 07:05.907
Has that tea set always been there,

07:05.940 --> 07:07.608
or am I already high?

07:07.642 --> 07:10.512
Wait, so, we're gonna, like...

07:10.545 --> 07:11.679
drink the weed?

07:11.711 --> 07:13.380
Trust me.

07:13.413 --> 07:17.185
Tonight, I am your shaman.

07:17.218 --> 07:18.853
Copy?

07:18.885 --> 07:20.687
I have heard that some guys

07:20.721 --> 07:23.091
are just so afraid of being vulnerable

07:23.123 --> 07:24.858
that when they find
someone that they really like,

07:24.892 --> 07:26.026
they just... they really want

07:26.060 --> 07:27.228
to try and protect their heart,

07:27.260 --> 07:30.397
so they... they push the woman away.

07:30.430 --> 07:32.233
And where exactly did you hear that?

07:32.266 --> 07:33.368
I think I read it somewhere.

07:33.401 --> 07:35.237
"Chicken Soup for the Thirsty Soul"?

07:36.504 --> 07:37.705
I'm sorry.

07:37.738 --> 07:39.307
I keep forgetting
other people have feelings.

07:39.339 --> 07:41.476
Yes, and right now, they're hurt.

07:41.509 --> 07:42.477
Yeah.

07:42.509 --> 07:45.045
Guys, I just want answers.

07:45.079 --> 07:47.048
What is happening with Aaron?

07:47.081 --> 07:48.116
How does he feel about me?

07:48.149 --> 07:49.716
Okay, we can't answer that.

07:49.750 --> 07:51.084
There's only one person who can.

07:51.118 --> 07:53.221
Jesus.

07:53.254 --> 07:55.457
What? He truly is the only One.

07:55.490 --> 07:56.624
Mm.

07:56.656 --> 07:58.726
She... She's not wrong.

07:58.759 --> 07:59.762
But I'm still gonna go talk to Aaron.

07:59.787 --> 08:00.727
- No!
- Unh-unh!

08:00.760 --> 08:02.831
Don't let her go.
Asking a man about his feelings

08:02.863 --> 08:04.399
is like setting yourself on fire.

08:04.432 --> 08:06.568
But right now,
I feel like a crazy person,

08:06.601 --> 08:08.803
and I have to figure out
what the hell is going on!

08:08.836 --> 08:11.072
Okay.

08:11.105 --> 08:12.941
Excuse me.

08:12.973 --> 08:15.543
Girl, you better let her go.

08:17.377 --> 08:18.445
I will pray on my way.

08:18.478 --> 08:19.680
Thank you.

08:19.714 --> 08:21.249
I'm so drunk, I got another drink.

08:21.281 --> 08:23.851
But for real, where have you been?

08:23.884 --> 08:25.652
I haven't seen you around campus lately.

08:25.685 --> 08:26.687
I've been around.

08:26.721 --> 08:28.622
I mean, I'm the R.A. now,

08:28.656 --> 08:30.257
so policing my little Hawkins babies

08:30.291 --> 08:32.993
and just kind of
saving the world, really.

08:33.025 --> 08:34.027
Yeah.

08:34.059 --> 08:35.429
'Cause I thought

08:35.462 --> 08:37.265
maybe you had got boo'd up or something.

08:37.297 --> 08:38.631
Hmm?

08:38.666 --> 08:39.600
Boo'd up?

08:39.633 --> 08:41.268
No.

08:41.301 --> 08:42.302
No, I'm solo.

08:42.335 --> 08:45.205
Super solo. Yeah, solo dolo.

08:45.238 --> 08:47.307
All the way.

08:47.340 --> 08:49.810
So then, what are you doing
later tonight?

08:50.978 --> 08:52.180
What am I doing tonight?

08:52.213 --> 08:54.348
Uh...

08:54.382 --> 08:56.917
Quack, quack, bitch.

08:58.652 --> 09:01.455
I guess I'm kicking with you tonight.

09:01.488 --> 09:03.724
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Good.

09:10.897 --> 09:12.666
- Hey.
- Ohhh.

09:12.699 --> 09:15.469
Um... Ana. Hi.

09:15.502 --> 09:16.738
Where's Aaron?

09:16.771 --> 09:17.805
Um...

09:17.838 --> 09:20.208
Um...

09:20.241 --> 09:21.543
Uh, bathroom?

09:21.575 --> 09:22.844
Yeah.

09:22.877 --> 09:26.647
He had the bubble guts,
um, and then he went home,

09:26.680 --> 09:29.483
uh, to go to sleep,

09:29.517 --> 09:31.084
probably for the rest of the night.

09:31.118 --> 09:32.219
Right.

09:32.252 --> 09:33.488
Mm-hmm. Alone.

09:33.521 --> 09:34.488
- Right.
- Mm.

09:34.521 --> 09:35.823
Right.

09:35.855 --> 09:37.558
Okay.

09:37.592 --> 09:38.593
Thanks.

09:41.127 --> 09:42.863
This dude got us lying for him, man.

09:42.896 --> 09:44.898
He's 100% in a relationship.

09:44.931 --> 09:45.999
Hm.

09:46.032 --> 09:47.435
No? Okay.

09:47.468 --> 09:50.872
Well, you were right because
that wine... that's fantastic.

09:52.540 --> 09:54.943
Did you not get my voicemail?
These people won't leave.

09:54.975 --> 09:56.209
Oh. Okay.

09:56.243 --> 09:57.844
Did you want me to, like,
swing back in an hour?

09:57.877 --> 09:58.879
No, no, no. It's too late.

09:58.912 --> 10:00.047
Um...

10:00.080 --> 10:01.449
Nomi, hey.

10:01.482 --> 10:02.784
No, he... Uh, come in.

10:02.816 --> 10:04.918
- I completely forgot. Come on.
- Hey.

10:04.951 --> 10:08.188
Everyone, this is my student, Nomi.

10:08.222 --> 10:10.725
Nomi, this is, uh, everybody else,

10:10.757 --> 10:12.707
including Professor Chavez

10:12.732 --> 10:14.176
- from the Music Department.
- Oh.

10:15.429 --> 10:16.564
Hi. It's really nice to meet you.

10:16.597 --> 10:17.632
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:17.656 --> 10:19.791
Nomi has this voracious appetite...

10:19.834 --> 10:21.301
- I do.
- ...for second wave feminism.

10:21.334 --> 10:22.536
I love it.

10:22.570 --> 10:23.871
It's... It's... It's incredible,

10:23.903 --> 10:26.202
and I promised her a copy

10:26.227 --> 10:27.952
- of the documentary "Bloody Town Hall."
- Mm-hmm.

10:27.977 --> 10:29.241
- Have you ever seen it?
- I can't wait.

10:29.266 --> 10:30.410
Well, then I don't want
to keep you waiting.

10:30.444 --> 10:32.613
- Okay. Okay.
- Just go have a seat. I'm gonna go find it.

10:32.646 --> 10:34.916
Be here.

10:34.949 --> 10:36.952
- Hey.
- Hello.

10:38.018 --> 10:40.320
<i>So, Luca made oolong tea</i>

10:40.353 --> 10:44.092
<i>infused with Blueberry Hornet
and... I'm not sure what else.</i>

10:44.124 --> 10:46.226
<i>After one cup, I felt nothing...</i>

10:46.260 --> 10:49.163
<i>so I snuck another cup.</i>

10:49.195 --> 10:50.731
<i>And then...</i>

10:50.765 --> 10:55.470
I am officially Luca Jae Hall high.

10:55.502 --> 10:59.607
The shaman does not approve
that second cup.

10:59.640 --> 11:02.076
Oh.

11:02.108 --> 11:04.811
Watching this makes me realize

11:04.844 --> 11:07.748
that we are tiny, tiny specs,

11:07.781 --> 11:11.185
just like these swans.

11:11.218 --> 11:14.856
One dies, and the other one
just keeps on living.

11:14.888 --> 11:17.257
I mean, what else
is a swan supposed to do

11:17.291 --> 11:18.925
but live, you know?

11:18.959 --> 11:20.161
Hmm.

11:24.330 --> 11:26.334
We're in a relationship.

11:26.367 --> 11:27.702
Mm. Yeah, we are.

11:28.868 --> 11:30.637
- But who knows, right?
- Hm?

11:30.670 --> 11:33.775
Nothing is for sure.

11:33.808 --> 11:35.043
Um...

11:35.075 --> 11:37.478
Do you think that we're gonna
be together forever

11:37.511 --> 11:40.147
or just another college statistic,

11:40.180 --> 11:41.782
destined to perish?

11:41.815 --> 11:44.051
Maybe you need...

11:44.084 --> 11:46.887
Don't leave me.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.222
Okay. I'm not going anywhere.

11:48.254 --> 11:51.792
But how do you know that?

11:51.825 --> 11:54.127
What if another swan comes along?

11:54.161 --> 11:55.863
What if you lose interest?

11:55.896 --> 11:57.464
What if <i> I</i> lose interest?

11:57.497 --> 11:58.632
Is my...

11:58.666 --> 11:59.700
Do you feel that?
Is my tongue swelling up?

11:59.733 --> 12:00.968
Babe, your tongue is fine.

12:01.001 --> 12:03.471
Take some breaths and ride the tea.

12:03.503 --> 12:04.971
Don't let the tea ride you.

12:05.004 --> 12:07.808
Just... breathe.

12:10.276 --> 12:13.214
Yeah, you're right.

12:13.247 --> 12:14.681
I feel a lot better.

12:14.714 --> 12:16.718
Oh, I am riding the tea.

12:16.751 --> 12:19.054
Riding the tea, riding the tea,
riding the tea.

12:20.220 --> 12:22.589
No, tea is riding me. I have to go.

12:24.291 --> 12:25.993
Don't look at me!

12:27.000 --> 12:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:02.396 --> 13:03.897
Just ignore it.

13:33.794 --> 13:35.896
Rochelle, you want in on this pizza?

13:35.930 --> 13:37.799
Nah, I'm good.

13:42.435 --> 13:44.738
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.

13:44.771 --> 13:46.273
What?

13:46.306 --> 13:47.608
I'm sorry. I can't...

13:47.641 --> 13:48.943
- What?
- I can't do this.

13:48.975 --> 13:50.277
Why?

13:50.310 --> 13:52.479
I just...

13:52.512 --> 13:55.916
I don't know. I just... I-I can't.

14:02.122 --> 14:04.892
Bye, you guys. Good to see you again.

14:22.409 --> 14:23.978
- You were fantastic.
- Mm.

14:24.011 --> 14:26.613
Oh, wait.
Where did you go when you left?

14:26.646 --> 14:28.114
I hid behind a car across the street.

14:28.147 --> 14:29.282
- You did not.
- I did.

14:29.315 --> 14:30.618
- No, you didn't.
- I did.

14:30.651 --> 14:32.853
- Did anyone see you?
- No. I was like a ninja.

14:36.323 --> 14:37.625
- I have to say...
- Mm-hmm.

14:37.657 --> 14:40.728
- ...lying to my co-workers with you...
- Uh-huh.

14:40.761 --> 14:41.863
it's kind of hot.

14:41.896 --> 14:44.131
Yeah. It's really hot.

14:53.574 --> 14:56.142
Oh. Heyyy.

14:56.175 --> 14:58.879
Hey. Are you okay?

14:58.912 --> 15:00.647
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:00.680 --> 15:04.752
I kind of over-served myself
on Luca's tea.

15:04.785 --> 15:09.757
Just needed to touch
some cold tile, you know?

15:09.790 --> 15:11.592
Um, are <i> you</i> okay?

15:11.624 --> 15:15.495
Uh... I'm all right.

15:15.528 --> 15:17.530
Want to talk about it?

15:17.564 --> 15:20.166
Uh...

15:20.199 --> 15:23.036
I mean, this is kind of
an embarrassing conversation

15:23.070 --> 15:24.671
for me to have with you, so...

15:24.704 --> 15:25.739
Embarrassing?

15:25.772 --> 15:28.909
You do... see me right now, right?

15:31.478 --> 15:33.948
It can't get much more
embarrassing than this.

15:42.555 --> 15:45.258
Uh, I'm just...

15:45.291 --> 15:46.393
I'm really confused

15:46.426 --> 15:48.762
about what's going on with Aaron.

15:48.795 --> 15:50.031
Mm-hmm.

15:50.064 --> 15:52.233
He's just been giving me
such mixed messages lately,

15:52.266 --> 15:55.102
and I just... I just wish
I knew what he wanted.

15:55.135 --> 15:57.038
I-I wish I knew what was in his head.

15:57.070 --> 15:58.705
Like, does he want to be with me?

15:58.738 --> 16:00.407
Does he want to have a relationship?

16:00.440 --> 16:02.075
- Okay. Hold on, hold on.
- Does he even want to keep this thing going?

16:02.108 --> 16:03.978
- Hold on. Hold on!
- Because he's acting like...

16:04.011 --> 16:07.381
Who cares what he wants?

16:07.414 --> 16:09.750
What do <i> you</i> want?

16:09.782 --> 16:12.585
I mean...

16:12.618 --> 16:14.588
I want to be with him.

16:14.621 --> 16:16.924
Well, there you go.

16:16.956 --> 16:18.725
Go tell him what you want.

16:18.758 --> 16:20.794
Go tell him how you feel.

16:22.863 --> 16:24.832
You know,

16:24.864 --> 16:26.499
you give good advice when you're high.

16:26.532 --> 16:28.902
I'm not high anymore, but thanks.

16:30.503 --> 16:31.605
Bye, Nomi.

16:36.877 --> 16:37.844
Hey.

16:37.877 --> 16:39.280
Hey.

16:42.483 --> 16:43.751
How was your night?

16:43.784 --> 16:46.620
- Hm?
- Were you with Paige?

16:46.652 --> 16:48.488
Yeah, why?
Do you want to judge me again?

16:48.521 --> 16:50.925
No. So, the other night...

16:50.958 --> 16:52.660
Mm-hmm.

16:52.693 --> 16:55.429
...when we got into it at the hotel...

16:55.462 --> 16:57.131
I was out of line.

16:58.331 --> 16:59.866
- Hmm.
- Seeing you with Professor Hewson

16:59.900 --> 17:01.469
just kind of threw me,

17:01.502 --> 17:03.771
and, you know, I should have
considered the fact

17:03.803 --> 17:08.340
that you're obviously
an evolved and amazing human.

17:08.375 --> 17:11.512
You should be able to live
your life however you want to.

17:11.544 --> 17:14.180
- Mm-hmm.
- Free of my judgment.

17:14.214 --> 17:16.715
Yeah.

17:16.750 --> 17:19.787
You know what, um, would really help me

17:19.819 --> 17:21.954
get over this fighting thing faster?

17:21.989 --> 17:24.157
- Hm?
- Like four more eggs in a nest.

17:24.191 --> 17:26.060
It would really do it.

17:26.092 --> 17:28.294
Hey.

17:28.328 --> 17:29.997
Okay, why are you so obsessed

17:30.030 --> 17:33.067
with watching "The Price is Right"?

17:33.099 --> 17:36.971
I enjoy watching active military
win Toyota hatchbacks.

17:37.003 --> 17:40.206
Yeah. Sorry for tweaking
so hard last night.

17:40.240 --> 17:43.310
You know I don't actually
worry about us, right?

17:43.342 --> 17:45.646
Paranoia happens
on that sneaky second cup.

17:45.678 --> 17:46.813
Mm-hmm.

17:46.847 --> 17:49.316
I mean, it did scare me
a little, though.

17:49.348 --> 17:52.552
I know that no one can promise
anyone a happily ever after,

17:52.586 --> 17:53.721
but can we promise

17:53.753 --> 17:56.523
to make every moment
we have together special?

17:56.557 --> 17:58.692
Please?

17:58.724 --> 18:00.493
If I could give you

18:00.527 --> 18:03.097
a Toyota hatchback to seal the deal,

18:03.129 --> 18:04.531
I would.

18:04.564 --> 18:06.499
Thank you.

18:06.532 --> 18:08.668
<i>So, thanks to Luca's weed tea,</i>

18:08.702 --> 18:11.839
<i>I'd realized that there was
no point in stressing about</i>

18:11.871 --> 18:14.340
<i>a future that I couldn't control.</i>

18:16.976 --> 18:19.079
<i>And it also allowed me to help Ana</i>

18:19.112 --> 18:22.215
<i>finally take back her control.</i>

18:24.283 --> 18:29.022
So, um... I've been replaying
last night at the club

18:29.056 --> 18:30.858
over and over again, you know?

18:30.890 --> 18:33.226
Should I be mad? Can I be mad?

18:33.260 --> 18:35.695
Look, this is on me, honestly,

18:35.729 --> 18:39.533
because I haven't been
exactly straight with you.

18:39.566 --> 18:41.602
And I, uh... I owe you an explanation.

18:41.635 --> 18:43.137
I realize that.

18:43.169 --> 18:44.871
Um...

18:44.905 --> 18:46.639
I was doing some thinking
last night, just kind of...

18:46.673 --> 18:48.608
You mean...

18:48.641 --> 18:50.710
when you weren't in your room?

18:50.743 --> 18:54.247
- It's not like that.
- No, it's whatever.

18:54.281 --> 18:56.216
No, it's actually not "whatever."

18:56.250 --> 18:58.219
It's just...
Look, when I thought about it,

18:58.252 --> 19:02.056
I realized that I couldn't be mad

19:02.089 --> 19:03.823
because we haven't said what we are.

19:03.857 --> 19:07.060
So that's why I asked you to come over

19:07.093 --> 19:11.564
because I-I want to be honest
about what I want.

19:11.598 --> 19:13.666
Okay.

19:13.700 --> 19:14.836
What is that?

19:17.271 --> 19:19.673
I want us to be together.

19:19.705 --> 19:23.409
<i>Honesty will always lead
an undefined relationship</i>

19:23.443 --> 19:25.812
<i>to its definition.</i>

19:25.846 --> 19:28.249
You know, last week when you, um,

19:28.281 --> 19:31.519
- you talked about us being a couple...
- Mm-hmm.

19:31.551 --> 19:34.454
...it just kind of made me
realize that, uh...

19:34.487 --> 19:35.688
I don't know.

19:35.722 --> 19:37.992
Maybe we're in two different spaces.

19:38.024 --> 19:39.493
You know?

19:39.525 --> 19:43.263
I mean, I love doing
what we're doing, but I...

19:43.297 --> 19:44.932
For me, personally,

19:44.964 --> 19:47.935
I just don't know if I'm ready
to be in, like, a full...

19:47.967 --> 19:49.936
full-on relationship right now,

19:49.970 --> 19:53.339
you know... in my life.

19:53.373 --> 19:55.342
So...

19:55.375 --> 19:58.012
Oh.

19:58.044 --> 19:59.379
Okay.

20:01.181 --> 20:02.950
But I think you're so dope, you know?

20:02.983 --> 20:07.154
- And I wish you...
- I think you should leave now.

20:10.490 --> 20:12.626
