six because of an argument?

39:09.096 --> 39:09.972
{\an1}Like, what does that
have to say about you?

39:10.056 --> 39:11.474
Please don't.

39:13.642 --> 39:14.769
Wow.

39:14.852 --> 39:16.729
On the surface Jionni
looks like a nice kid

39:16.812 --> 39:18.105
{\an8}but at the end of the day

39:18.189 --> 39:19.398
{\an8}that kid was
a *** wangster.

39:26.989 --> 39:29.784
Jionni, please!

39:29.867 --> 39:32.036
Jionni, please.

39:32.119 --> 39:33.120
Where'd he go?

39:33.204 --> 39:35.873
{\an8}Jionni knows exactly
who he's dating.

39:35.956 --> 39:38.125
{\an7}For Jionni to get mad
about Nicole

39:38.209 --> 39:38.876
{\an7}acting a little crazy
in a club

39:38.959 --> 39:41.796
{\an8}that's weak.

39:41.879 --> 39:44.715
{\an8}[rock song playing]

39:51.722 --> 39:52.973
{\an8}Where is he?

39:57.228 --> 39:59.355
{\an8}I'm really
a good girlfriend.

39:59.438 --> 40:00.981
{\an8}I didn't cheat on you.
I didn't do anything.

40:01.065 --> 40:03.567
{\an7}May be a little crazy
when I drink, but that's it.

40:03.651 --> 40:04.527
{\an8}Like...

40:04.610 --> 40:07.822
{\an7}I just don't understand
why he left me

40:07.905 --> 40:08.531
{\an8}'cause he knows
that I love him.
