00:17.930 --> 00:19.260
What are you doing?

00:20.400 --> 00:22.500
What does it look like I'm doing?

00:22.510 --> 00:24.560
I'd rather not say.

00:25.730 --> 00:28.120
I'm trying to open these cinnamon buns.

00:28.150 --> 00:29.350
Why?

00:29.360 --> 00:32.100
I thought I'd try and
do a little baking.

00:33.660 --> 00:35.470
You drunk?

00:35.490 --> 00:37.340
A little bit.

00:39.970 --> 00:44.750
Why is it child-proof? Are
kids o. d. 'ing on this stuff?

00:44.760 --> 00:46.920
Have you considered
reading the instructions?

00:46.940 --> 00:49.730
Ooh, listen to Mr. College Boy.

00:51.070 --> 00:56.240
To open, strike sharply
on edge of counter. Really?

00:56.250 --> 00:58.370
Really.

00:58.660 --> 01:01.430
All right. I'll play along.

01:03.030 --> 01:08.060
I christen thee H. M. S.
Kitchen Table. Godspeed.

01:14.950 --> 01:18.210
I think we got a bad bun tube.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.150
Gimme.

01:24.090 --> 01:26.360
You just gotta know how to whack it.

01:29.580 --> 01:32.840
I bow to your superior expertise.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.810
So, how come you're all spiffed up?

01:35.830 --> 01:37.250
I've got a date.

01:37.260 --> 01:39.390
Oh, two nights in a row.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.800
So, who's the glutton for punishment?

01:41.810 --> 01:45.490
At the risk of tooting my own horn, I
am actually seeing two different women.

01:45.520 --> 01:47.600
- Wow, two women.
- Yeah.

01:47.610 --> 01:50.520
And yet you're still
tooting your own horn.

01:53.340 --> 01:54.510
Hey, you know what's fun?

01:54.530 --> 01:57.320
When you can talk 'em into
tooting each other's horns.

01:57.710 --> 01:59.390
I'm not seeing them at the same time.

01:59.410 --> 02:01.660
Well, that makes it more difficult.

02:01.670 --> 02:04.220
But not impossible.

02:05.400 --> 02:08.240
u put the icing on after it
comes out of the oven, right?

02:08.250 --> 02:10.130
Right. Drizzle, don't squeeze.

02:10.139 --> 02:12.520
Thus spake the whacker.

02:15.610 --> 02:19.630
So, what prompted this
break from serial monogamy?

02:19.640 --> 02:22.650
I don't know, I'm just tired of
putting all my eggs in one basket.

02:22.660 --> 02:24.200
The basket being a woman?

02:24.210 --> 02:24.940
Yes.

02:24.950 --> 02:27.490
And the eggs being your bun tube?

02:28.900 --> 02:33.430
No, see, the thing is, when I'm just dating
one woman at a time, if she dumps me...

02:33.440 --> 02:35.800
When she dumps you.

02:36.390 --> 02:39.150
Either way, I have to start
from scratch finding a new woman.

02:39.160 --> 02:42.130
However, when I'm dating two
women, if one of them dumps me...

02:42.140 --> 02:45.170
When one of them dumps you.

02:45.180 --> 02:47.350
Either way, I'm not alone.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.810
Wait a second. Wait a second.

02:49.260 --> 02:53.560
You're saying that it's advantageous
to date more than one woman at a time?

02:53.980 --> 02:56.830
Good Lord, man, you're a genius!

02:57.920 --> 02:59.480
Yeah, ha-ha.

02:59.490 --> 03:01.760
We must tell other men!

03:01.770 --> 03:04.370
Okay, maybe I'm a
little late to the party.

03:04.380 --> 03:05.650
A little late?

03:05.670 --> 03:09.120
The girl already jumped out of the
cake and everybody's had a piece.

03:09.130 --> 03:11.150
Well, late or not, I'm here.

03:11.170 --> 03:16.190
And it turns out when it comes to 40-year-old, divorced
moms in the San Fernando Valley, I'm quite the catch.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.190
I'm not surprised.

03:17.220 --> 03:18.070
You're not?

03:18.080 --> 03:21.530
Lights out at fat camp, a
jelly bean is steak tartar.

03:22.290 --> 03:26.430
Hey, I'm single, employed,
disease-free, well-read,

03:26.440 --> 03:30.640
cute as a bug and perfectly capable of
pretending to like other people's children.

03:30.650 --> 03:31.930
Impressive.

03:31.940 --> 03:36.240
Do these broads know that you're dipping
your chip in the salsa and the guacamole?

03:37.000 --> 03:37.790
What?

03:37.810 --> 03:41.700
You know, hittin' two
pinatas with one stick?

03:42.000 --> 03:45.240
Toppin' off both tanks
with the same hose?

03:45.250 --> 03:48.190
Throwin' your balls down two alleys?

03:49.270 --> 03:51.580
Still don't get it?

03:52.030 --> 03:54.660
No, I got it. And, uh,
and thank you. Um...

03:54.670 --> 03:55.770
but no, they don't know.

03:55.780 --> 03:59.510
These are divorced Valley moms trolling for
a new schmuck to replace the old schmuck.

03:59.530 --> 04:01.810
And you let them think
that might be you?

04:01.820 --> 04:04.950
It's not like I have to lie.
Look at me-- I scream schmuckdom.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.580
They're rising. It's a miracle.

04:08.870 --> 04:11.960
Yes, the miracle of yeast. I gotta go.

04:11.970 --> 04:13.490
Go, my son.

04:13.510 --> 04:17.700
Drizzle thy frosting on the
divorced sticky buns of the Valley.

04:44.750 --> 04:47.040
You're a great cook, Uncle Charlie.

04:47.050 --> 04:48.800
It's no big deal.

04:48.810 --> 04:51.940
Those chefs on TV act like they're
curing leprosy or something.

04:54.490 --> 04:56.170
Can you make meat loaf?

04:56.180 --> 04:58.370
Does it come in a tube?

05:00.790 --> 05:03.770
No-- God-- it
comes on a plate.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.520
Can I have some of that?

05:13.770 --> 05:15.150
Beer? No.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.400
Why not?

05:16.410 --> 05:19.540
Because when you're 14, you
don't ask your uncle for beer.

05:20.100 --> 05:22.030
Who do I ask?

05:22.540 --> 05:23.640
I don't know...

05:23.650 --> 05:28.060
try hangin' outside a liquor store and look for a
guy wearing house slippers and talking to himself.

05:29.640 --> 05:31.850
What's his name?

05:36.600 --> 05:39.170
You can't have any beer, Jake.

05:39.180 --> 05:41.150
Man, I thought you were cool.

05:41.160 --> 05:43.320
I am. And you know what makes me cool?

05:43.330 --> 05:46.480
The fact that your opinion
means less than squat to me.

05:49.090 --> 05:51.210
How old were you when
you had your first beer?

05:51.220 --> 05:54.350
13... two...

05:54.360 --> 05:56.030
Yeah, right.

05:56.060 --> 05:58.080
Listen, we're not talking about
me. We're talking about you.

05:58.090 --> 05:59.420
What about me?

05:59.440 --> 06:05.640
Well, it's like this: Alcohol is for people
who can afford to lose a few brain cells.

06:08.220 --> 06:10.250
Yeah? So?

06:10.580 --> 06:12.700
I rest my case.

06:17.170 --> 06:19.560
What case?

06:29.270 --> 06:31.300
Morning, buddy. How
do you like your eggs?

06:31.310 --> 06:33.820
In an Easter basket.

06:35.880 --> 06:37.870
Scrambled it is.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.290
- Morning.
- Morning.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.260
- Whatcha doing?
- Cooking breakfast.

06:41.270 --> 06:42.490
How do you like your eggs?

06:42.500 --> 06:43.880
Sunny side up.

06:43.890 --> 06:46.190
Scrambled it is.

06:46.450 --> 06:48.470
Cooking for Dummies.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.310
No offense, Jake. I'm
actually cookin' for everybody.

06:54.310 --> 06:56.500
What brought this on?

06:56.510 --> 06:59.980
I Don't know. I... thought
I'd expand my horizons a bit.

07:02.740 --> 07:03.900
What?

07:03.910 --> 07:07.670
I'm just trying to figure out how
scrambled eggs are gonna get you laid.

07:08.630 --> 07:10.550
You and me both.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.280
I got it!

07:16.010 --> 07:17.590
Hello?

07:17.600 --> 07:20.230
Oh, hi, Stephanie.

07:20.530 --> 07:23.690
Yeah, yeah, I, uh, I
had a great time, too.

07:23.700 --> 07:26.110
Yes, it-it was special.

07:26.120 --> 07:29.340
I-I don't usually do that
on a first date either.

07:31.640 --> 07:34.560
Thank you for letting
me do that, by the way.

07:37.460 --> 07:39.830
- Tonight? Oh, gee.
- Hey, Alan!

07:39.840 --> 07:42.390
- How do you like your eggs?
- Uh, uh, one sec.

07:42.400 --> 07:45.740
Charlie, Stephanie wants to see me tonight, but
I already made a date with Katie. What do I do?

07:45.750 --> 07:47.990
Scrambled it is.

07:50.960 --> 07:56.940
Uh, uh, the thing is, uh, I already made plans,
uh, with my, uh, you know, son, who I love dearly.

07:57.530 --> 07:59.910
- What are we doing?
- Nothing. Go away.

08:00.890 --> 08:02.820
Oh, oh, w-what are we doing?

08:02.830 --> 08:07.340
Uh, uh, well, he and I have this, uh, this
father-son thing uh, where once a week, we...

08:07.360 --> 08:09.140
- Rent go-karts.
- Rent go-karts.

08:09.150 --> 08:10.320
And, uh... and, uh...

08:10.330 --> 08:11.880
- Eat pizza.
- And eat pizza.

08:11.890 --> 08:13.290
- And, uh...
- And drink beer.

08:13.300 --> 08:15.050
And drink... Go away!

08:16.390 --> 08:22.090
and, and drink, uh, uh, a lot of water,
which the body needs to, uh, to stay healthy.

08:22.100 --> 08:25.190
Um, anyway, we-we're
on for Saturday, right?

08:25.200 --> 08:29.600
Uh, okay, uh, uh, great, great.
Good. I-I'll see you then. Okay, bye.

08:31.190 --> 08:33.990
- We're not going
go-karting, are we? - No.

08:35.419 --> 08:38.309
You're using me for your
own purposes, aren't you?

08:38.990 --> 08:41.210
Here's $20.

08:42.159 --> 08:44.850
Hey, Alan. Taste these.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.760
Why does it smell like bourbon?

08:50.410 --> 08:53.660
The book said "season to taste."

08:55.550 --> 08:57.950
Just kidding. I spilled.

08:58.810 --> 09:00.440
N-No, thank you.

09:00.450 --> 09:02.330
Suit yourself.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.090
A little too much egg.

09:10.890 --> 09:12.300
Jake, let's go!

09:12.310 --> 09:14.490
I told your mother I'd
have you back by 7:00.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.630
Hey, Alan, Alan, Alan.

09:18.550 --> 09:20.570
Would you taste my hollandaise sauce?

09:20.920 --> 09:22.160
You made hollandaise sauce?

09:22.180 --> 09:24.130
You tell me.

09:27.490 --> 09:30.030
You did not make hollandaise sauce.

09:31.030 --> 09:33.490
Damn you, eggs Benedict.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.470
Charlie, why are you doing this?

09:35.480 --> 09:36.270
Doing what?

09:36.280 --> 09:37.600
In the six years that
I have been living here,

09:37.610 --> 09:40.820
the only time I've seen you turn
on the stove was to light a cigar.

09:41.610 --> 09:43.970
Yeah, well, people grow, people change.

09:43.980 --> 09:46.600
People get drunk while
watching the Food Network.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.890
Jake, let's go!

09:48.920 --> 09:53.890
Uh, I may not be back till late-- I'm planning
on giving my rose to bachelorette number two.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.550
Only you could gay up bangin' two women.

10:03.900 --> 10:07.350
Says the man in the apron with
the curdled hollandaise sauce.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.890
So you admit it is hollandaise sauce?

10:09.900 --> 10:12.210
Mom said you could drop me off
at Gabe's house so we can study.

10:12.220 --> 10:13.250
Are you really gonna study?

10:13.270 --> 10:15.150
- Sure.
- Great.

10:15.160 --> 10:18.120
See that? He respects
me enough to lie to me.

10:18.670 --> 10:20.860
Hey, Alan.
Speaking of lies--

10:21.190 --> 10:25.980
at some point, one of these broads is gonna ask you
a question for which you will have no ready answer.

10:26.000 --> 10:26.800
Like what?

10:26.820 --> 10:29.420
Well, it could be as simple as:
"What did you do last night?"

10:29.430 --> 10:33.980
or as tricky as: Why is there
a pasty stuck to your testicles?

10:35.970 --> 10:38.240
The point is, you need to be careful.

10:38.250 --> 10:40.370
So you're gonna teach
me how to lie to women?

10:40.380 --> 10:44.570
Well, do you know enough to pull the
pasty off and say "Happy Anniversary"?

10:46.420 --> 10:48.010
I do now.

10:48.040 --> 10:51.820
Another thing you need to remember is always
answer a question with another question.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.110
- What do you mean?
- Exactly.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.860
- What?
- Great, you're all set.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.910
- Drunk again?
- Yep.

11:01.890 --> 11:04.100
Well, thank you. I
appreciate the advice.

11:04.110 --> 11:05.330
I've got more.

11:05.340 --> 11:10.190
Charlie, please don't take this the wrong way,
but if a semi-functioning wino, such as yourself,

11:10.200 --> 11:14.480
can date several women at the same
time, I'm quite certain I can handle two.

11:17.630 --> 11:20.300
Why would I take that the wrong way?

11:23.780 --> 11:26.550
Tastes like stale ass.

11:32.030 --> 11:35.600
Is it just me or does this thing we
have feel really, really comfortable?

11:35.610 --> 11:37.230
Oh, yeah.

11:37.240 --> 11:40.200
I mean, you know, maybe not pet-names-
for-our-pee-parts comfortable,

11:40.220 --> 11:42.610
but we're certainly getting there.

11:43.790 --> 11:48.740
Oh, hey, next week, my ex is taking
my daughter to see his parents,

11:48.750 --> 11:52.700
so you and I can spend
the whole weekend in bed.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.530
That-that sounds great.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.710
I'll leave myself alone till then.

11:59.580 --> 12:03.450
Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait--
uh, uh, next weekend?

12:03.460 --> 12:10.440
Uh, you know, uh, I'll have to check, but I-I-I
think Saturday is a-a working Saturday for me.

12:10.450 --> 12:12.110
Oh, no. Really?

12:12.120 --> 12:15.380
Yeah, yeah, it's unfortunate,
but in today's economic climate,

12:15.390 --> 12:19.210
Saturday is no longer the Sabbath for anybody
except perhaps very religious Jewish people.

12:19.230 --> 12:22.150
You know, the guys with
the beards and the hats?

12:22.170 --> 12:23.960
Did you see Yentl? I love that movie.

12:23.970 --> 12:26.680
That's one I wouldn't mind owning.

12:27.470 --> 12:30.440
Alan, are you seeing another woman?

12:31.820 --> 12:34.710
Charlie, are you seeing another woman?

12:34.720 --> 12:36.610
Why would you ask me that?

12:36.620 --> 12:39.240
I just need to know I can trust you.

12:39.260 --> 12:42.430
ah, well, trust is a two-way street.

12:42.440 --> 12:43.770
I know.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.230
Do you?

12:45.270 --> 12:48.940
Because without trust,
all we have is sex.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.850
Well, you can trust me, Charlie.

12:52.860 --> 12:54.600
God, I hope so.

12:54.620 --> 12:57.630
I've been hurt before.

12:58.180 --> 13:01.340
I won't hurt you. I promise.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.770
Okay, then.

13:05.750 --> 13:07.590
Another woman?

13:07.600 --> 13:08.950
Yeah.

13:08.980 --> 13:11.840
You think I'm involved
with another woman?

13:11.870 --> 13:12.620
Yeah.

13:12.640 --> 13:16.550
You actually think I'm seeing someone
else at the same time I'm seeing you?

13:16.560 --> 13:17.120
Yeah.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.400
How did you know?

13:23.320 --> 13:24.470
Do you need to get that?

13:24.480 --> 13:26.200
Are you crazy?

13:27.490 --> 13:30.710
Hey, it's Charlie. Do your
thing when you hear the beep.

13:32.810 --> 13:35.780
Hey, Uncle Charlie, it's
me, Jakey. I'm drunk.

13:35.790 --> 13:41.810
How are you? Are you with a
girl? Does she have big ones?

13:42.640 --> 13:44.860
Jake, where are you?

13:45.640 --> 13:47.840
What mall?

13:48.260 --> 13:51.450
They all have pretzel
stands, you doofus.

13:53.060 --> 13:56.450
Okay, you stay right where
you are, and I'll come get you.

13:57.520 --> 14:00.300
We'll talk about that later.

14:00.310 --> 14:02.680
They're big enough.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.540
I love you too, buddy.

14:06.990 --> 14:09.860
Yeah, we have shared some good memories.

14:10.740 --> 14:13.190
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

14:14.110 --> 14:16.620
Do you have to go?

14:17.160 --> 14:19.520
No, we got time.

14:24.790 --> 14:27.380
What the heck took you so long?

14:27.390 --> 14:30.350
Believe me, I came
as quickly as I could.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.250
What is that?

14:32.260 --> 14:34.280
It's a pretzel. You want some?

14:34.290 --> 14:35.860
No, thanks.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.970
It's got jalapenos!

14:37.980 --> 14:39.830
Oh, you're gonna regret that.

14:39.850 --> 14:41.990
- What do you mean?
- You'll see.

14:42.390 --> 14:44.020
Where'd you get the booze, knucklehead?

14:44.030 --> 14:45.490
I did what you told me to do.

14:45.500 --> 14:48.630
Me and Gabe gave money to
a creepy guy to buy us beer.

14:48.640 --> 14:49.760
Oh, Jake.

14:49.780 --> 14:52.380
His name was Satellite Jack.

14:52.390 --> 14:55.450
He said the government
stole his kidneys.

14:55.460 --> 14:58.360
Is $20 too much for a six-pack?

14:58.370 --> 15:02.230
Not when a guy with no kidneys named
Satellite Jack is buying it for you.

15:02.690 --> 15:04.340
Where'd you get the $20?

15:04.360 --> 15:06.000
It was a bribe from my father.

15:06.030 --> 15:06.810
You're kidding.

15:06.820 --> 15:10.730
I know. For a cheap guy, he
can be surprisingly generous.

15:11.310 --> 15:12.770
That's true.

15:12.790 --> 15:15.480
Deep down I love him.

15:16.140 --> 15:18.370
And I love you, too.

15:18.840 --> 15:21.760
Great. Everybody loves everybody.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.160
So, where's your friend?

15:24.170 --> 15:28.300
Gabe? He ditched me when I started
throwing up, the bat rastard.

15:29.440 --> 15:30.870
- Get out of the car.
- What?

15:30.880 --> 15:33.410
I just had it detailed--
get out, get out, get out.

15:33.420 --> 15:36.700
All right, but I'm tellin'
ya I'm all done throwin' up.

15:38.950 --> 15:42.240
I see what you mean
about those jalapenos.

15:43.480 --> 15:49.020
Listen, my mom still thinks I'm studying at Gabe's
house, so I don't think I should go home at this time.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.150
What do you expect to do?

15:51.180 --> 15:54.130
I don't know. You up
for an R-rated movie?

15:54.700 --> 15:57.330
Boobies, no violence.

16:00.470 --> 16:02.890
Step away from the car.

16:03.390 --> 16:06.340
- Nope, false alarm.
- Wait for it.

16:06.350 --> 16:08.480
Wait for what?

16:09.820 --> 16:12.040
Oh, how about that?

16:12.730 --> 16:14.110
You get any on your shoes?

16:14.120 --> 16:16.020
A little.

16:18.050 --> 16:19.990
There's a plastic bag in the trunk.

16:20.020 --> 16:24.970
Remove your shoes and place them in the bag,
then seal it and put it back in the trunk.

16:24.980 --> 16:26.430
Okay.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.330
- Then climb in after it.
- Okay.

16:44.910 --> 16:47.050
- Alan?
- Surprise.

16:47.060 --> 16:49.690
I thought you were with
your son go-karting.

16:49.710 --> 16:53.300
Yeah, listen, um, I lied about that.

16:53.330 --> 16:55.580
But I can't lie anymore.

16:55.590 --> 16:59.810
I was with another woman, but
all I could think about was you.

16:59.820 --> 17:04.510
I'm a one-woman man and,
baby, you're that woman.

17:04.920 --> 17:06.230
MAN: Who is it, honey?

17:06.240 --> 17:07.760
Just a salesman. Go away.

17:07.770 --> 17:09.210
Wait a minute-- are
you seeing someone else?

17:09.230 --> 17:11.099
Get lost!

17:11.410 --> 17:14.000
I-I thought we had something special.

17:14.010 --> 17:17.800
Who's in there? Are you married?
Because I really thought...

17:42.170 --> 17:45.070
You know, your body's
sending you a message.

17:45.080 --> 17:48.280
Yeah, it's sayin' I really
should chew my food more.

17:49.110 --> 17:52.450
Look at that shrimp. You could
wash it off and rve it again.

17:53.710 --> 17:56.820
Your body is also telling
you that alcohol is poison.

17:56.830 --> 17:59.150
If it's poison, why do you drink it?

17:59.170 --> 18:02.310
Because there are things
inside of me I need to kill.

18:03.370 --> 18:06.630
You can't kill bad feelings
with alcohol, Uncle Charlie.

18:06.660 --> 18:07.570
Right.

18:07.580 --> 18:09.910
And you can't stuff your
emotions with cupcakes.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.160
Believe me, I've tried.

18:12.170 --> 18:13.900
I'm sure you have.

18:13.920 --> 18:17.390
And if you ever need to talk about
any of this stuff, I'm here for you.

18:18.790 --> 18:20.550
Good to know.

18:20.570 --> 18:23.440
Whoa, felt that one in my nuts.

18:24.180 --> 18:26.700
ALAN: Hello? Anybody home?

18:26.710 --> 18:28.320
Are you gonna rat me out?

18:28.340 --> 18:31.620
Jake, buddy, how could
you even ask me that?

18:40.480 --> 18:42.940
Hey, what's goin' on?

18:43.930 --> 18:47.350
Jake took the 20 bucks you gave
him and got drunk with a friend.

18:53.820 --> 18:56.300
Bad boy.

19:05.450 --> 19:08.770
So... how 'bout a beer?

19:19.000 --> 19:21.400
Never... again.

19:22.440 --> 19:24.400
Me neither.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.250
You know what the problem is?

19:28.260 --> 19:30.530
The women, the drinking...

19:30.550 --> 19:33.370
You guys look at me
and you think it's easy.

19:33.380 --> 19:37.090
But what you don't see is all the years
of hard work and dedication it took

19:37.110 --> 19:41.130
to make me the happy-go-lucky,
drunken, ass-wrangler I am today.

19:42.820 --> 19:44.420
Charlie?

19:44.430 --> 19:47.230
Oh, sorry, baby, I had
a little family drama.

19:47.260 --> 19:51.440
Remember, you said if I gave you what
you want, you'd give me what I want.

19:51.470 --> 19:54.680
Oh, right--
breakfast in bed.

19:55.110 --> 19:56.380
How do you like your eggs?

19:56.390 --> 19:58.250
Scrambled.

19:58.270 --> 20:00.250
Yes!

20:05.250 --> 20:07.900
You know, young man,

20:08.190 --> 20:12.210
if I hadn't have been
electrocuted earlier this evening,

20:12.680 --> 20:17.030
you and I'd be having a
serious talk right now.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.310
Yeah. Hold on.
