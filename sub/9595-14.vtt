So we can get an idea
of his most recent activities.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.251
Okay.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.487
Wow. You hacked in there
pretty fast, man.

08:08.489 --> 08:10.655
That's some
next-level stuff, son.

Can't anybody
just get onto facebo--?

08:12.826 --> 08:15.494
No, I did something special,
and dad loves me for it.

08:15.496 --> 08:17.963
All right.
Let's see here. Okay.

08:17.965 --> 08:20.832
Look at these pictures
zoey tagged this guy in.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.567
They are
entirely too close.

08:22.569 --> 08:23.869
Man, that's less than
a phone book's difference

08:23.871 --> 08:24.970
Between them.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.705
Holding hands?!

08:26.707 --> 08:28.540
Unh-unh. No, no, no.
That's almost first base.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.008
I do not like that.

08:30.010 --> 08:33.545
Oh, my god!
Are they kissing?!

08:33.547 --> 08:36.548
Wow.
He really is french.

08:36.550 --> 08:37.983
This ends right now.

[ knock on door ]

08:39.152 --> 08:41.686
Zoey, we need to talk.
All right?

08:41.688 --> 08:43.855
This guy is not
good enough for you.
Dad!

08:43.857 --> 08:46.892
Sweetheart,
you're young.

08:46.894 --> 08:47.993
You'll have
plenty of time to --

08:47.995 --> 08:50.762
Dad, it's over
between me and andre.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.932
Oh -- no!

08:53.934 --> 08:54.900
Mnh!

08:54.902 --> 08:56.668
Really?

08:56.670 --> 09:02.741
Look, babe,
I know it's hard right now,

09:02.743 --> 09:04.910
But breaking up with him
is the right thing to do.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.312
No, dad.
He broke up with<i> me.</i>

09:07.314 --> 09:09.981
What?

09:09.983 --> 09:11.683
How dare he?!

09:15.122 --> 09:17.756
I can't believe
he broke up with her.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.024
Oh, hey, diane.
What's wrong?

09:19.026 --> 09:21.126
We got
a zoey problem.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.594
What?

09:22.596 --> 09:24.963
Sweetheart, are you concerned
about your sister?

09:24.965 --> 09:27.666
Yes, I'm concerned!
She ate all the ice cream.

Everybody knows
that chunky monkey is mine.

09:30.304 --> 09:32.804

See that?
Mm-hmm.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.778
Now both of our daughters
are upset

09:39.780 --> 09:40.946
Because
of this monster.

09:40.948 --> 09:41.947
Okay, listen.

09:41.949 --> 09:44.950
That maybe zoey
just wasn't right for him?

09:44.952 --> 09:46.851
You mean
not<i> white</i> for him.

09:46.853 --> 09:48.687
Oh, my god! Dre!
What?

09:48.689 --> 09:49.988
There is zero evidence

09:49.990 --> 09:51.656
That race had anything
to do with this!

09:51.658 --> 09:55.961
Our daughter is perfect,
so there is no other reason.
Ohh.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.964
I hate bigotry.
And that kid is a bigot.

09:58.966 --> 10:02.000
All right? He's a filthy,
french, cheese-munching bigot.

10:02.002 --> 10:05.303
Dre, they broke up.
Isn't that what you wanted?

10:05.305 --> 10:06.838
What I wanted
was some ice cream,

10:06.840 --> 10:08.039
But we don't have
any more,

10:08.041 --> 10:09.774
So now I have to
go downstairs

10:09.776 --> 10:11.810
And eat a bag
of semi-sweet chocolate chips

10:11.812 --> 10:14.779

takes my pain away!

10:14.781 --> 10:17.215
Um...Pam.

10:17.217 --> 10:20.051
Yeah?
I kind of got a situation.

10:20.053 --> 10:22.053
The other day,
I noticed

And then this morning,

10:30.998 --> 10:33.264
I noticed
that she got a roommate.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.966
Yeah, well,
you got to get used to it.

10:34.968 --> 10:38.103
Once a couple move in,
others are not far behind.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.939
So how long before downtown
gets totally gentrified?

10:40.941 --> 10:42.774
It happens fast.
Oh.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.242
When you get to be
my age,

Amazing.
How did you know that?
