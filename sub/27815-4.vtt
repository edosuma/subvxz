00:02.380 --> 00:05.000
Dad owed money in Mexico.
Did he tell you that ?

00:05.625 --> 00:07.220
That's why we left.

00:07.300 --> 00:08.547
Did you promise her money ?

00:09.500 --> 00:11.220
- How much ?
- A hundred grand !

00:11.300 --> 00:13.340
- I need it by tonight.
- Tonight ?

00:13.420 --> 00:15.767
- I'll take care of this.
- Yeah, someone has to.

00:16.012 --> 00:17.292
So you left me up there.

00:17.372 --> 00:19.540
I had a choice to make.
And I chose Anna.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.020
I'll always choose Anna.

00:21.100 --> 00:21.927
Come on.

00:23.020 --> 00:24.091
Nice.

00:24.171 --> 00:26.160
I don't know what it is.
Or how to sell it.

00:28.920 --> 00:31.960
No, Jesus ! Jack you're not supposed
to take the whole lot !

00:33.400 --> 00:35.420
- Hundred and fifty ?
- What you take me for ?

00:39.892 --> 00:41.480
You're afraid, aren't you ?

00:41.600 --> 00:43.420
It's not him I'm afraid of, Anna.

00:43.500 --> 00:44.660
Who then ?

00:44.740 --> 00:46.878
If the cop's are anywhere nearby...

00:46.958 --> 00:49.820
You know what happens
to your wife and kids.

00:50.578 --> 00:52.260
I did a bad thing,

00:52.340 --> 00:54.460
If I asked you to do something for me,
would you ?

00:54.540 --> 00:55.620
Name it.

00:55.700 --> 00:58.460
When I said I put the drugs back...
I might have lied a little bit.

01:00.900 --> 01:01.980
Fuck.

- First bicuspid.
- In German, bitte schon.

04:02.740 --> 04:08.100
Premolar. Second bicuspid.
Premolar zwei.

04:08.180 --> 04:11.180
- Next.
- First molar, second molar...

04:11.260 --> 04:13.940
Third molar.

04:14.020 --> 04:17.740
Molar eins, molar zwei. Why do I have
to learn them in German ?

04:18.019 --> 04:20.660
Because most of our patients
prefer German.

04:23.260 --> 04:27.860
Thomas !

04:27.940 --> 04:30.540
Geh schlafen now !

04:31.460 --> 04:33.100
He should have been in bed
hours ago.

04:33.180 --> 04:36.500
You'd better brush your teeth, Thomas if
you don't want to end up in the chair !

04:36.580 --> 04:39.100
Rosa ?

04:39.180 --> 04:43.700
- Weisheitszahn.
- Excuse me ?

04:44.420 --> 04:47.220
- Weisheitszahn.
- Weisheitszahn. I said that.

04:47.900 --> 04:50.780
Wisdom tooth !

04:52.540 --> 04:55.580
Did I ever tell you
how proud of you I am ?

04:55.660 --> 04:57.620
I'm a laughing stock,

04:58.340 --> 05:01.580
no one takes me seriously
as a barrel racer, I'm a freak.

05:01.900 --> 05:04.540
- You have character.
- I don't want character.

05:04.620 --> 05:08.620
But you have character.
Everything you do has character.

05:08.700 --> 05:11.460
The character to practice every day,

05:11.540 --> 05:14.940
the character to stand up for yourself,
for our beliefs,

05:16.140 --> 05:18.660
for the life you'd like to lead.

08:52.460 --> 08:54.300
Hey.

08:57.380 --> 09:00.500
Are you sure you want this ?

09:38.540 --> 09:40.220
Put the gun down.

09:42.700 --> 09:44.660
You just asked for this, Anna.

09:52.580 --> 09:56.900
Give her one reason
why she shouldn't kill you.

10:02.300 --> 10:05.820
I let my daughter stay here
because she needed a safe place.

10:07.660 --> 10:09.900
What the fuck were you thinking ?

10:15.740 --> 10:19.140
You smuggle a bunch of cocaine then
whinging to my daughter about it ?

10:19.220 --> 10:21.380
Please.

10:23.540 --> 10:28.420
- My family...
- No. My fucking family.

10:31.300 --> 10:33.420
I think you should kill him.

10:34.660 --> 10:37.620
Mum, please don't.

10:42.020 --> 10:45.220
- What's he doing ?
- Praying ? I think.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.860
Jesus.

10:51.700 --> 10:54.220
Back in the room mate.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.780
I don't make deals with the devil.

10:57.860 --> 10:59.620
Good the Devil's a fucking fairy tale.

10:59.700 --> 11:03.860
I'm your worst fucking nightmare
and I'm in your fucking kitchen.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.740
- Who's the bagman ?
- What ?

11:09.860 --> 11:11.860
- Who's the bagman ?
- I don't understand.

11:11.940 --> 11:13.820
You bring it over the border
then what ?

11:13.900 --> 11:15.220
- They text me.
- They text you what ?

11:15.300 --> 11:18.380
- Instructions.
- Show me.

11:22.180 --> 11:25.260
Give me your phone.

11:41.340 --> 11:46.260
- It's in Spanish.
- Muchas fucking gracias.

11:48.980 --> 11:52.900
So park your truck outside the motel
and leave it unlocked.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.700
This was the first text
I ever received.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.740
- Drugs in the truck ?
- I never know where.

11:59.460 --> 12:01.220
Then what ?

12:02.220 --> 12:04.900
- I get a good night's sleep.
- That easy ?

12:04.980 --> 12:07.220
- The first time, yeah.
- Then what ?

12:08.740 --> 12:11.820
- Something happened.
- What ?

12:13.580 --> 12:15.700
You.

12:15.780 --> 12:18.100
I came back and you were
searching the houses.

12:18.180 --> 12:19.980
So I hid the drugs
on a neighbor's property.

12:20.060 --> 12:21.940
Hang on.

12:23.140 --> 12:25.260
You've done this before ?

12:28.540 --> 12:30.900
Twice.

12:32.020 --> 12:34.100
Did you know that ?

12:38.180 --> 12:39.660
You still feeling it ?

12:40.380 --> 12:43.020
- What ?
- The Holy Spirit ?

12:44.780 --> 12:47.380
- Fuck off.
- Exactly.

12:47.460 --> 12:51.340
- The first time was a small amount.
- But you're a pro though, right ?

12:51.540 --> 12:55.980
- I am an innocent man, Mr. Worth.
- No, you are not.

13:04.700 --> 13:06.700
Jack ?

13:10.140 --> 13:12.740
He's a drug smuggler, Anna.

13:37.100 --> 13:39.060
Do you put that up your bum ?

13:39.940 --> 13:42.780
- Stop it.
- What ? They do.

13:43.380 --> 13:46.300
Don't you ? They do !
They hide it up their arses.

13:48.060 --> 13:51.380
Here you are. 4.37pm today.

13:52.300 --> 13:55.500
No caller ID. This him ?

13:56.180 --> 13:58.620
- Yeah.
- What'd he tell you ?

13:59.140 --> 14:01.300
Park the drugs outside
a motel in Stavely.

14:01.380 --> 14:03.020
- When ?
- Tonight.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.820
Give you a deadline ?

14:06.980 --> 14:09.060
Midnight.

14:12.540 --> 14:14.740
Okay, they're in worse trouble
than we thought.

14:14.820 --> 14:18.420
No, they're fucked.
They are so fucked.

14:19.100 --> 14:23.820
He's three hours late to delivering
five million quid's worth of cocaine.

14:24.460 --> 14:28.260
I mean, there's nothing
we can do love, really.

14:29.500 --> 14:34.020
- Okay, let's go, Anna.
- Please, help me.

14:34.100 --> 14:35.540
- It's too late.
- No, it can't be !

14:35.620 --> 14:38.780
- There's nothing we can do.
- They're lying.

14:38.860 --> 14:40.460
- Tell him.
- What ?

14:41.180 --> 14:44.540
- You found the fucking bag !
- What ?

14:44.620 --> 14:47.700
- Tell him !
- Where is it ?

14:47.980 --> 14:50.060
- They found it. Then they lost it.
- Lost it ?

14:50.140 --> 14:52.460
- But he can find it again. Can't you ?
- You should sit down.

14:52.540 --> 14:54.380
You lost the...

15:10.220 --> 15:13.740
Anna, any minute now they're going
to turn up looking for their drugs.

15:13.820 --> 15:16.380
- And we can't be here when it happens.
- Do you think I'm scared ?

15:16.460 --> 15:20.140
- Of a cartel ? Yeah, you should be.
- Whitey was shot in the heart.

15:20.540 --> 15:22.740
There's nothing a cartel can do
to scare me.

15:25.020 --> 15:26.860
- Where is the bag now ?
- Fuck knows.

15:30.500 --> 15:33.820
Under the bed, under the bed, yes.

15:35.660 --> 15:38.940
Under the bed. Go there.

15:39.020 --> 15:42.300
Go, stay down.

15:42.380 --> 15:46.060
Please go, you stay there.

15:59.580 --> 16:02.540
Look, I tell you what.

16:12.540 --> 16:14.540
I could kill him.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.540
- Kill him ?
- You got a better idea ?

16:19.620 --> 16:20.900
- No.
- Right.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.820
But I can't accept killing.

16:24.660 --> 16:26.700
Please.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.740
- Help me find the drugs.
- That's not going to happen.

16:30.820 --> 16:33.380
- Why not ?
- Because I'm going to kill him.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.780
For fuck's sake, Jack, you can't
just murder a cartel bagman.

16:35.860 --> 16:37.260
Course I can.

16:37.340 --> 16:39.660
Cartel's a fucking walk in the park
compared to a British hooligan.

16:39.740 --> 16:42.820
I should know. I've been to Mexico.
They're never letting me back in there.

16:42.900 --> 16:45.620
- Dad don't.
- Why not ?

16:45.700 --> 16:49.980
- Because it won't end there, will it ?
- Well, it will for us.

16:51.780 --> 16:55.740
But not for Johan ! Or his family.

16:56.340 --> 16:57.780
So ?

16:57.860 --> 17:00.620
"So ? " If you kill one of them,
they'll send more men here.

17:00.700 --> 17:02.420
Probably wipe out
the whole fucking colony.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.220
Fucking good.

17:16.900 --> 17:19.099
Do you recognize that ?

17:24.380 --> 17:27.180
- Yeah.
- What is it ?

17:29.060 --> 17:31.420
It's a ring.

17:31.500 --> 17:34.060
Whose ring ?

17:37.020 --> 17:39.100
Helen's.

17:41.620 --> 17:43.860
Who gave it to her ?

17:46.700 --> 17:50.420
- I did.
- What does it say on the inside ?

17:53.460 --> 17:56.540
- To Helen.
- What else ?

18:01.620 --> 18:03.540
Love, Jack.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.780
So you told her you loved her
then you ruined her life...

18:07.860 --> 18:11.620
- He was doing his job, Anna.
- And murdered her son.

18:20.060 --> 18:22.340
Who killed our son.

18:24.780 --> 18:27.700
Who killed your brother,

18:27.780 --> 18:31.060
almost killed your mum.

18:31.140 --> 18:34.300
You fucked them up as well as us.

18:38.020 --> 18:41.340
That's two families
you've wrecked.

18:41.420 --> 18:45.500
- Depends on your point of view.
- Yeah it does.

18:45.580 --> 18:48.940
The least you can do
is save this one.

18:52.340 --> 18:56.060
You stole his drugs.
And then you lost his bag.

18:57.140 --> 18:58.980
Help him.

19:17.620 --> 19:20.620
- What is this ?
- Rhubarb wine.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.100
That's fucking horrible.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.960
Are you going to look for the bag ?

20:09.320 --> 20:11.600
I would be grateful, Mr. Worth.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.160
Can you protect your family ?

20:23.160 --> 20:25.560
I can protect my family, yeah.

20:35.120 --> 20:36.920
Pick it up.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.760
First time ?

21:13.600 --> 21:15.960
I've held a rifle.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.720
- Bunnies ?
- Deer.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.360
- Ever shot anyone ?
- Course he hasn't.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.720
Have you ever shot anyone ?

21:39.760 --> 21:42.600
You can't protect them, can you ?

21:43.480 --> 21:45.640
I can.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.040
I'll protect them.

21:50.320 --> 21:53.640
- How ?
- Guns.

21:53.720 --> 21:56.040
There's a shit load
in the back of that truck.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.160
No fucking way.

21:58.240 --> 22:01.800
You taught me to shoot, mum.
Remember ?

22:03.720 --> 22:07.400
Do they know they're in danger,
your family ?

22:07.880 --> 22:10.280
No.

22:10.360 --> 22:14.000
- Let's tell them, shall we ?
- Please...

22:14.280 --> 22:18.000
- Please.
- Hey.

22:19.400 --> 22:22.360
Thomas, please, come out...

22:22.440 --> 22:25.880
Thomas. Come out, Thomas, please.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.720
Sarah ?

22:47.200 --> 22:49.920
Can I borrow you a minute ?

22:51.200 --> 22:53.160
Stay here.

22:58.680 --> 23:00.800
Stay here.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.640
Are you okay ?

23:15.440 --> 23:17.440
What are you doing here ?

23:19.600 --> 23:23.040
What are you all doing
in my kitchen ?

23:24.480 --> 23:26.720
How long you been married, Sarah ?

23:29.520 --> 23:31.400
Long enough.

23:37.440 --> 23:40.720
Do you consider your husband
an honest man ?

23:42.760 --> 23:44.840
- Is this an interrogation ?
- Yeah, it is.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.560
Go back to the bedroom.

23:47.640 --> 23:51.080
My husband is an honest man, yes.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.800
- They don't know.
- Know what ?

23:57.720 --> 23:59.920
I think you might.

24:01.880 --> 24:04.840
- What is he talking about ? ?
- Leave my family alone.

24:04.920 --> 24:08.960
You should have thought of that before
you fucked with mine, shouldn't you ?

24:09.040 --> 24:12.840
What about all those people down there
in that fucking church of yours ?

24:14.000 --> 24:15.320
Do they know ?

24:15.400 --> 24:18.240
Know what ?
What's he talking about, papa ?

24:18.320 --> 24:20.520
What about all these people
you dunk in that fucking river,

24:20.600 --> 24:22.880
my daughter included by the way ?

24:26.120 --> 24:28.600
Do they know your lying to them ?

24:31.840 --> 24:33.840
Do you want me to tell her ?

24:37.360 --> 24:40.440
What do you call a man
who tells lies ?

24:42.200 --> 24:44.200
- A liar.
- My husband's not a liar !

24:47.560 --> 24:49.880
- No !
- Jack, no !

24:50.600 --> 24:53.240
For sentimental reasons
I always go on two.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.360
- Five. Four. Three.
- Sarah.

24:56.480 --> 25:00.560
- Two.
- I traffic cocaine !

25:00.640 --> 25:02.840
I traffic cocaine.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.840
I traffic, I traffic.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.480
- Cocaine ?
- Yeah. It's a drug. Class A. Illegal.

25:28.560 --> 25:31.840
- Even in Canada apparently.
- I know what cocaine is !

25:31.920 --> 25:33.800
Good. Cause your husband
just smuggled

25:33.880 --> 25:35.880
five million dollars' of it
across two borders.

25:35.960 --> 25:40.200
That is twenty-five years taking it up
the arse in the showers

25:40.280 --> 25:43.520
then smiling at your family
through shatter-proof plastic.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.120
What's all this about ?

25:54.840 --> 25:56.800
Angela ?

25:57.480 --> 25:59.520
It's about Anna.

26:00.680 --> 26:01.920
That's ridiculous.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.840
Ridiculous is that
I thought she was safe here.

26:03.920 --> 26:06.800
I thought she was safer
here with you than me.

26:06.880 --> 26:09.280
Imagine how that felt,

26:09.360 --> 26:13.360
thinking that my little girl
was safer with another woman.

26:15.320 --> 26:17.520
But I'm a fucking idiot
cause it was all a lie.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.640
Yeah, but they are all liars,
aren't they ?

26:20.880 --> 26:23.280
They don't pay their taxes,

26:23.360 --> 26:27.160
they use their kids as slave labor,
treat their women like shit.

26:27.240 --> 26:31.600
I mean, we didn't raise you
to be treated like shit, darling.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.120
How dare you ?

26:36.200 --> 26:38.880
In my house.

26:38.960 --> 26:42.000
How dare you speak about us
in this way.

26:43.880 --> 26:47.000
You think because I choose
to wear these clothes,

26:47.080 --> 26:50.720
because I choose to obey my husband,

26:50.800 --> 26:53.400
because I choose to follow Scripture.

26:54.200 --> 26:57.800
You think that makes me a fool ?

26:58.680 --> 27:00.040
You know nothing about us.

27:00.120 --> 27:04.240
You know nothing about our beliefs,
you know nothing about our marriage.

27:04.320 --> 27:07.240
I do actually.

27:07.840 --> 27:11.760
- He's a criminal, Sarah.
- My husband is an honest man.

27:11.840 --> 27:16.160
- Your husband is a fucking moron.
- And he's put you all in danger.

27:16.240 --> 27:19.400
Johan, tell the truth.

27:20.720 --> 27:24.520
You've always told the truth.
Tell her.

27:24.600 --> 27:27.400
Tell her what it means
to be married in the eyes of God.

27:29.400 --> 27:33.200
We are one flesh, tell her.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.600
Tell her.

27:37.640 --> 27:41.760
Tell her we don't lie to each other.

27:41.840 --> 27:44.240
Tell her ! Speak !

27:45.480 --> 27:47.720
Why won't you speak ?

27:49.240 --> 27:52.760
Look at me.
Why won't you look at me ?

27:52.840 --> 27:57.320
Tell me the truth !

28:09.960 --> 28:12.400
I am what they say I am, Sarah.

28:15.680 --> 28:18.280
I am a criminal.

28:26.760 --> 28:29.680
Don't touch me !

28:50.800 --> 28:52.040
Here.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.640
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

30:08.880 --> 30:11.640
I knew you were hiding something.

30:12.560 --> 30:15.520
The thought crossed my mind

30:17.360 --> 30:20.160
that you'd met someone else.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.880
So I said to myself, I said.

30:25.960 --> 30:30.440
Sarah, rid yourself of poisonous
thoughts !

30:31.920 --> 30:35.800
Rid yourself of doubt.
Be the wife he deserves !

30:39.080 --> 30:42.680
I never kept a thing from you
for twenty-two years

30:44.720 --> 30:48.040
and you have made a stupid
little woman of me.

30:50.480 --> 30:53.960
If you knew something was wrong,
why didn't you ask him ?

30:56.240 --> 30:58.240
He's your husband !

31:01.080 --> 31:03.040
Mama.

31:05.240 --> 31:09.320
You must have heard him. At night.
You must have done.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.480
He doesn't sleep.

31:14.040 --> 31:17.280
Every night for months now
he just gets up,

31:17.360 --> 31:22.400
and he goes into his study
or the kitchen and he just walks,

31:22.480 --> 31:25.880
all night, backwards and forwards,
around and around the kitchen table.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.520
Until I want to scream.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.840
I asked you if anything was wrong

31:32.920 --> 31:36.080
and you didn't trust me
enough to tell me.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.200
Instead you opened up to her...

31:43.200 --> 31:46.160
You don't see what
you don't want to see.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.920
You don't hear what
you don't want to hear.

31:50.440 --> 31:53.920
Your hope your faith,
your endless optimism.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.320
They're all about looking away.
They're all lies, Mama.

31:59.640 --> 32:02.920
You are of one flesh.
You are as much of a liar as he is.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.400
And you ?

32:05.680 --> 32:07.600
What about you ?

32:08.360 --> 32:11.360
You and your plan
to leave the colony ?

32:13.160 --> 32:16.360
You're going to run
away from home, Rosa ?

32:19.560 --> 32:22.840
- Anna ?
- I didn't say anything.

32:23.200 --> 32:26.040
- Then how did she know ?
- I'm your mother.

32:26.720 --> 32:28.800
I'm your mother.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.160
So what you know that,
but you don't know this ?

32:32.240 --> 32:36.760
I hate it here !
This place is bullshit !

32:39.520 --> 32:43.680
It has nothing to do with Jesus
or God or love or anything.

32:43.760 --> 32:45.720
It's just about a bunch
of hateful old men

32:45.800 --> 32:49.040
who wanna use rules
to keep everyone in line !

32:56.680 --> 32:58.600
Look at you,

33:00.880 --> 33:03.280
look where your rules have got you.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.360
Jack.

33:15.840 --> 33:18.760
- I know, tick tock.
- Wait, what about them ?

33:18.840 --> 33:22.760
- What about us ?
- Tell them, Jack.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.640
You're all going to die.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.120
- We need to clear out.
- We're going to die ?

33:43.200 --> 33:44.700
I'm not leaving until
I know why he did it.

33:44.780 --> 33:46.680
- Does it matter, Anna ?
- It matters to me and probably them.

33:46.760 --> 33:48.840
- I can answer.
- Money, darling. That's why he did it.

33:48.920 --> 33:50.600
- Was it ? Money ?
- Dad.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.960
Why is he turning the lights off ?
What's happening ?

33:53.040 --> 33:57.000
- Thomas.
- They murdered my brother !

34:07.480 --> 34:09.600
There was a drought.

34:10.560 --> 34:12.440
Our colony was dying !

34:12.520 --> 34:16.679
We needed diesel to irrigate the soil,
but we couldn't afford it.

34:17.040 --> 34:21.320
I met a man, a business man
in Casas Grandes.

34:22.159 --> 34:23.679
He offered me a loan.

34:24.639 --> 34:26.400
The Elders were against it,

34:26.480 --> 34:29.920
but Sarah's brother Eli and I
took the money in secret.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.520
The crop failed.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.760
And I couldn't repay the debt.

34:38.679 --> 34:41.679
Then Eli, he went missing.

34:43.480 --> 34:47.600
The Elders they sent out search
parties. But there was no sign.

34:48.080 --> 34:50.360
- Come on, we have to go.
- No wait.

34:50.440 --> 34:53.760
Thomas came to stay with us.
Days passed.

34:57.320 --> 34:59.840
Then Thomas found his father.

35:02.200 --> 35:03.520
What was left of him.

35:05.760 --> 35:08.560
His body was missing.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.800
There was just...

35:17.840 --> 35:20.200
His head.

35:22.480 --> 35:26.800
So, I dug a pit and buried it.

35:27.240 --> 35:31.160
I kept the truth from you, Sarah.
And from you, Rosa.

35:31.320 --> 35:34.240
Only Thomas and I knew.

35:35.120 --> 35:37.160
Thomas,

35:37.880 --> 35:40.520
who has never spoken a word
since that day.

35:43.200 --> 35:48.160
You said he'd fled the colony,

35:48.240 --> 35:50.400
you said...

35:51.960 --> 35:55.160
You said he'd abandoned us.

35:55.240 --> 35:58.160
Why did you not tell me
the truth, Johan ?

36:00.440 --> 36:03.200
I wanted to protect you, Sarah.

36:07.040 --> 36:10.480
I searched the Scriptures
for guidance,

36:10.560 --> 36:12.960
but found nothing.

36:13.040 --> 36:17.040
All I had was my faith.
And sometimes not even that.

36:18.560 --> 36:22.440
Despite all that you still took me in ?
And kept me ?

36:22.520 --> 36:24.400
Even when my dad went mental ?

36:34.820 --> 36:38.580
- I don't condemn him, Anna.
- That's a relief.

36:38.660 --> 36:41.420
Your father is a violent man

36:42.220 --> 36:44.380
but at least he has courage.

36:46.980 --> 36:51.060
I have often asked myself
if my pacifism was just cowardice.

36:52.420 --> 36:54.300
Now I know.

36:58.900 --> 37:02.460
I am a proud, dishonest human being.

37:03.700 --> 37:06.780
And if I have never done
another man harm

37:08.100 --> 37:10.780
it's only because
I've never had cause to.

37:12.860 --> 37:14.700
Stop.

37:17.780 --> 37:20.820
I am all those things.

37:20.900 --> 37:23.340
We are one flesh.

37:36.060 --> 37:38.940
Look at them.

37:51.620 --> 37:53.820
Why can't we be like that ?

37:57.020 --> 38:00.940
We never all sit and talk.
And really listen.

38:04.380 --> 38:06.820
All we do is hurt each other.

38:13.340 --> 38:15.700
That night on the river.

38:19.380 --> 38:21.180
I felt safe.

38:27.220 --> 38:28.740
And you're jealous.

38:28.820 --> 38:32.180
You hate him because I love him.

38:33.100 --> 38:37.100
I'm just worried, darling,
I'm worried.

38:37.180 --> 38:40.060
- I don't know him.
- I do.

38:40.140 --> 38:43.420
I know everything about him.
And so do his family.

38:44.660 --> 38:46.540
He lied.

38:47.380 --> 38:51.140
But most of the time
he tells the truth.

38:52.820 --> 38:56.940
And that's why they trust each other.
We're the opposite.

38:58.060 --> 39:01.580
We lie to each other all the time.

39:05.660 --> 39:09.140
This whole fucking family was built
on lies.

39:17.820 --> 39:20.460
I tried to hang myself.

39:23.300 --> 39:27.540
I mean I actually tried to kill myself.

39:30.100 --> 39:34.500
Not once... Have either of you
talked to me about it...

39:37.020 --> 39:38.820
Anna,

39:43.020 --> 39:45.940
I want to talk about it.

39:46.020 --> 39:50.500
I felt safer with this family than
I've ever felt with either of you.

39:55.980 --> 39:58.180
Maybe

39:58.940 --> 40:01.940
Petey is better off without us.

40:16.860 --> 40:19.100
Please help them.

40:19.860 --> 40:22.140
We're trying, darling.

40:25.740 --> 40:27.420
The both of you must leave
with Jack and Angela.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.220
- What about you ?
- You cannot stay here.

40:29.380 --> 40:31.260
- We're not leaving without you.
- Come with us.

40:31.340 --> 40:35.180
- It's me they want.
- Why ?

40:37.580 --> 40:39.100
The drugs are missing.

40:44.060 --> 40:46.540
Look if we stay here, we're gonna die.

40:54.540 --> 40:58.660
Thomas, are you okay ?

41:06.540 --> 41:08.860
Mum, this is Thomas.

41:09.500 --> 41:10.940
He's six.

41:12.140 --> 41:15.460
He's the same age Petey'd be
if he was alive.

41:15.580 --> 41:19.420
- I know how old Petey is !
- What going to happen to him ?

41:22.500 --> 41:24.080
Anna...

41:24.500 --> 41:26.460
- My god.
- Shit.

41:26.820 --> 41:28.540
What's going on ?

41:31.340 --> 41:33.660
- Put them on the ground.
- Everyone, on the ground.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.300
Get down !

41:52.340 --> 41:55.060
- Hello ?
- Motherfucker.

41:57.980 --> 42:00.980
You've fucked up big time.

42:05.140 --> 42:06.780
What is your problem ?

42:06.860 --> 42:09.860
No, I don't have a problem.

42:09.940 --> 42:11.780
You have a problem.
