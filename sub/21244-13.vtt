00:05.670 --> 00:07.290
All right, everybody,

00:07.290 --> 00:09.830
for lunch I have made
a spiralized beet noodle

00:09.830 --> 00:11.830
with a little bit
of whipped feta.

00:11.830 --> 00:13.330
Honey, this looks delicious.

00:13.330 --> 00:14.960
I can't wait to dig in.

00:14.960 --> 00:17.920
I can't wait to dig a hole

00:17.920 --> 00:19.420
Dang!

00:21.080 --> 00:23.670
Sorry, but I don't think
that whipped feta

00:23.670 --> 00:25.330
is the culinary
equivalent of...

00:25.330 --> 00:26.670
[circuits buzzing]

00:26.670 --> 00:29.460
Uh, guys, I think
something's wrong.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.500
Yeah, it's called
spiralized beet noodles.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.960
No, I'm talking

is full,

00:41.830 --> 00:44.080
she's programmed
to return to The Organization

00:44.080 --> 00:45.620

Oops.

[whirring]

Oh. Where?

02:31.460 --> 02:32.880
It's over by the mirror.

Very funny, Judy.

-Stop it!
-Ow!

02:46.380 --> 02:47.540
I warned you.

02:47.540 --> 02:49.750
-[laughing]
-Okay, excuse me,

02:49.750 --> 02:52.460
but am I the only on here
who is worried

02:52.460 --> 02:55.000
about getting kicked
out of The Organization? Again?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.790
She's right.
We need to take a look

02:56.790 --> 02:58.460
at all the footage
Judy has stored
on her foot.

02:58.460 --> 03:00.670
Ha ha! Footage.

03:00.670 --> 03:02.540
Get it? Footage?

03:02.540 --> 03:03.710
Judy, do you mind?

03:03.710 --> 03:04.710
My pleasure.

03:04.710 --> 03:07.250
Ow!

03:07.250 --> 03:09.670
It's time to switch
to Bluetooth.

03:09.670 --> 03:11.460
All right,
let's get to work.

03:11.460 --> 03:13.670
Now we need to delete
anything that Judy
saw us do

03:13.670 --> 03:15.670
that we don't want
The Organization to see.

03:15.670 --> 03:17.620
Oh, it's not
just what I've seen.

03:17.620 --> 03:20.670
I've got cameras everywhere.

03:20.670 --> 03:23.080
Uh, just
out of curiosity,

03:23.080 --> 03:24.880
there aren't cameras
in the pantry, are there?

03:24.880 --> 03:29.540
Of course not,
Spongy Cakes At 3 a.m. Guy.

03:29.540 --> 03:31.670
I sleep eat.
It's not my fault.

03:31.670 --> 03:32.920
Okay,
first things first,

03:32.920 --> 03:34.540
we need to get rid
of all the footage

03:34.540 --> 03:36.460
where I tell Marisa
that we're spies.

03:36.460 --> 03:37.670
Oh, and the
part where I don't
memory spray Marisa

03:37.670 --> 03:39.670
because she knows
we're spies.

03:39.670 --> 03:41.580
Oh, and the part
where she gets involved
with us being spies.

03:41.580 --> 03:45.080
So basically everything
with Marisa in it.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.830
So what I'm hearing is,

03:46.830 --> 03:51.080
we're about to see
a Marisa movie!

03:51.080 --> 03:52.670
No, what you're hearing is

03:52.670 --> 03:56.290
you're about to get cut
from the Cooper Movie.

03:56.290 --> 03:57.960
Okay,
never mind that now.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.750
KC, we need to do
something

03:59.750 --> 04:01.380
that we've never
been able to do before.

04:01.380 --> 04:02.710
Get rid of Marisa.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.040
No offense.

04:04.040 --> 04:05.670
Some taken.

04:09.620 --> 04:13.580
All right, um...
I'm going to spray you now,

04:13.580 --> 04:15.960
and you're gonna forget
everything that happened

04:15.960 --> 04:17.170
in the last six hours.

04:17.170 --> 04:18.580
When you wake up,
chances are

04:18.580 --> 04:20.670
you're still gonna
be mad at me,

04:20.670 --> 04:23.330
and you're not gonna
want to be my friend anymore.

04:23.330 --> 04:26.380
And even though
you won't like me,

04:26.380 --> 04:28.710
I will always love you.

04:28.710 --> 04:29.710
[whimpering]

04:31.460 --> 04:34.040
Okay. I think
that I'm ready.

04:38.460 --> 04:41.210
I know that was hard
for you, KC.

04:41.210 --> 04:43.170
'Cause it sure
was hard for me.

04:44.830 --> 04:46.460
But we didn't
have a choice.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.380
I get it.

04:48.380 --> 04:50.120
I mean, Marisa could never
know the truth about us.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.000
I'm proud of you, honey.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.080
Mm-hmm.

04:59.750 --> 05:01.620
[whispering] Marisa?

05:02.710 --> 05:03.750
All clear.

05:03.750 --> 05:05.960
Mm, what
was that, vanilla?

05:05.960 --> 05:07.290
With a hint of lavender.

05:07.290 --> 05:09.710
Nice. Fake
memory erasing spray

05:14.460 --> 05:16.000
Guys, look, Marisa!

05:16.000 --> 05:18.420
Yes! Marisa
came to save us!

05:18.420 --> 05:20.080
Wait.
Marisa came to save us?

05:20.080 --> 05:22.620
How did Marisa
know we needed saving?

05:22.620 --> 05:24.790
And how exactly is she
going to rescue us?

05:24.790 --> 05:27.880
Marisa?
Break the glass!

[clangs twice]

05:43.750 --> 05:45.250
Come on, Marisa,
you can do this, okay?

05:45.250 --> 05:46.250
Try something.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.210
What the heck
is she doing?

05:54.210 --> 05:56.000
Showing us
what a big mouth she has?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.040
Because we already knew that.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.710
No. Know what, she's right.

06:00.710 --> 06:02.670
She's not dumb. She's smart.

06:02.670 --> 06:06.380
She's also someone whose grandma
made her take opera lessons.

06:07.540 --> 06:10.540
[holding piercing note]

06:10.540 --> 06:12.670
Amazing!

06:12.670 --> 06:14.120
Yes!

06:14.120 --> 06:16.670
One tailgate party.

06:16.670 --> 06:18.880
Admit it-- not only
do I have party-dar,

06:18.880 --> 06:20.750
but I did help you
on this mission,

06:20.750 --> 06:22.960
and I would be a good spy!

06:22.960 --> 06:24.920
Yeah, Marisa, could you
say that a little louder?

06:24.920 --> 06:27.170
I don't think they heard you
at the University of China.

06:27.170 --> 06:29.330
Wait. Whoa, whoa.

06:29.330 --> 06:30.710
There's a better party
across town.

06:30.710 --> 06:33.620
Live band. Cute,
age-appropriate drummer.

06:33.620 --> 06:35.250
Clarissa out.

06:36.920 --> 06:40.540
Wow. I can't believe
she recorded everything.

06:40.540 --> 06:42.580
Well, that's not
entirely bad.

06:42.580 --> 06:43.880
Maybe we can all
watch that time

06:43.880 --> 06:45.500
I was in the school play
and starred

06:45.500 --> 06:47.460
as Willy Loman
in Death of a Salesman.

06:47.460 --> 06:49.830
Death of an Audience
is what they should
have called it.

06:51.380 --> 06:53.080
Look, I think you guys
are actually really lucky.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.750
Judy is like a walking,
talking family album--

06:56.750 --> 06:59.960
except my family album
doesn't make fun of me
as I look through it.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.920
It should.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.120
I don't know,
it is kind of fun
just to look back.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.790
I mean, so much of
what we do,

07:07.790 --> 07:09.620
we're not supposed to talk
about ever again.

07:09.620 --> 07:11.500
Hey, if we're taking a walk
down memory lane,

07:11.500 --> 07:13.880
I'll never forget
that assignment in Rio.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.380
Ah, that was fun.

07:15.380 --> 07:16.920
Yeah, Dad,
that wasn't an assignment.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.790
We were on the run
from a crazed killer.

07:20.580 --> 07:22.790
Well, we survived.

07:22.790 --> 07:25.420
That's always fun.

07:25.420 --> 07:28.210
It's true. We've done
a lot of cool missions.

07:28.210 --> 07:30.830
A couple of them I even
got to leave the van for.

07:32.250 --> 07:34.000
And forgot to put
the emergency brake on,

07:34.000 --> 07:37.120
and the van rolled away.

07:37.120 --> 07:39.790
Can we just focus
on the positive?

07:39.790 --> 07:42.960
He's right.
My favorite missions
have always been the ones

07:42.960 --> 07:44.210
we've done as a family.

07:44.210 --> 07:46.710
Yeah, we are at our best
when we're together.

07:46.710 --> 07:49.210
And Ernie's not in charge
of putting the emergency
brake on.

07:51.080 --> 07:52.170
Hey, remember this?

08:03.960 --> 08:06.040
Okay, I have a visual
on you guys.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.420
Can everyone hear me?
Ah-choo!

08:08.420 --> 08:09.920
[all]
Bless you!

08:09.920 --> 08:11.420
I guess everyone
can hear me.

08:14.290 --> 08:16.040
I have a visual
on the targets.

08:16.040 --> 08:19.000
It's time to bake
the biscuits!

08:19.000 --> 08:20.250
What does that even mean?

08:20.250 --> 08:21.960
I'm trying to come up
with a catchphrase.

08:21.960 --> 08:26.290
The guy in the van
always has a catchphrase.

08:26.290 --> 08:28.380
Well, catch a new phrase.

08:31.250 --> 08:33.380
-Wow.
-Whoa!

08:33.380 --> 08:35.620
[appreciative whistle]

08:35.620 --> 08:37.290
[pleased chatter]

08:39.000 --> 08:41.040
Hi-dee-ho, there,
Bung Hillian!

08:41.040 --> 08:43.460
My family and I
are from out of town.

08:43.460 --> 08:45.420
We live in Toledo, Ohio

08:45.420 --> 08:48.580
and we're on our way
to Williamsburg, Virginia.

08:48.580 --> 08:51.830
You know, where they churn
butter the old-fashioned way.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.960
With a churner!

08:53.960 --> 08:55.830
All right, that's enough
out of you, Sparky.

08:55.830 --> 08:57.290
[forced chuckle]

08:57.290 --> 08:59.960
Anyway, as I was saying,
we're lost.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.960
I can't find Route 60.

09:01.960 --> 09:05.000
Now I've misplaced a lot
of things in my day,
by golly,

09:05.000 --> 09:07.500
but never a highway!

09:07.500 --> 09:10.830
Think maybe you can help me out?
I've got my map here.
It's in my fanny pack.

09:10.830 --> 09:12.960
You ever seen...?

09:14.830 --> 09:17.710
Hey! I've been on my hog
for the past few hours.

09:17.710 --> 09:20.290
So what does it take to get
a little sarsaparilla
around here?

09:20.290 --> 09:22.920
Travel back in time?

09:22.920 --> 09:26.790
Well, then I'll take a lemonade.
Make it a double.

09:27.920 --> 09:28.880
[laughter]

09:28.880 --> 09:31.250
-Ahh, good times.
-Yeah.

09:31.250 --> 09:34.750
Delete, delete, delete.
Delete, delete, delete.

09:34.750 --> 09:39.460
Wait. Delete, delete,
delete. Delete.

09:39.460 --> 09:43.080
Uh-oh. You've just
deleted our assignment
at the circus.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.500
So?

09:45.960 --> 09:47.670
So it was a major mission.

09:47.670 --> 09:51.040
Agent Johnson will notice
that that footage is gone.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.620
Okay. No big deal.
Dad, all you gotta do

09:52.620 --> 09:54.120
is drag the arrow
back into the trash bin

09:54.120 --> 09:55.920
where you put
the other memories,

09:55.920 --> 09:57.210
and then just pull 'em
back out to the desktop.

09:57.210 --> 10:00.080
Wait. It's not in
the trash bin anymore.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.120
That's because you
permanently deleted it!

10:02.120 --> 10:03.960
Wait a minute.

10:03.960 --> 10:07.670
Are you saying that
we cannot recover that footage?

10:07.670 --> 10:10.830
What part of "permanently
deleted" do you not understand?

10:12.960 --> 10:14.330
Uh, actually,
you know what, Judy?

10:14.330 --> 10:15.920
I'm going to have
to disagree with you.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.880
As my mom and the makers
of Compute Nanny would attest,

10:18.880 --> 10:22.830
nothing is ever permanently
deleted off your computer.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.920
Learned that one
the hard way.

10:27.330 --> 10:29.540
Okay, let's not pay
attention to the one

10:29.540 --> 10:32.620
with the $5 million built-in
operating system

10:32.620 --> 10:34.080
and take the word of a girl

10:34.080 --> 10:37.540
who thinks rebooting
happens in a shoe store.

10:38.830 --> 10:40.080
Okay, so
what I'm hearing

10:40.080 --> 10:42.710
is that it's
permanently deleted.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.830
Guys, this isn't good.

10:44.830 --> 10:47.080
I mean, Agent Johnson
is gonna know that we're
tampering with evidence.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.120
What are we gonna do?

10:49.120 --> 10:51.880
Okay, guys,
all we need is somebody
to blame it on, right?

10:51.880 --> 10:53.120
We need a fall guy,

10:53.120 --> 10:56.040
somebody who is
totally expendable,

10:56.040 --> 10:59.250
completely unsuspecting.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.290
Ernie, uh, do you mind
leaving the room

11:01.290 --> 11:03.250
for a few minutes while
we have a brief conversation

11:03.250 --> 11:05.920
behind your back?

11:05.920 --> 11:09.120
Sure, no problem.
I'll just be--

11:09.120 --> 11:11.080
Hey! Wait a minute!

11:16.920 --> 11:18.330
Tampering with evidence
is going to get us

11:18.330 --> 11:19.380
kicked out
of the Organization.

11:19.380 --> 11:20.920
Yeah, well,

11:20.920 --> 11:22.750
it doesn't have to be
all of us.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.620
K.C., for the last time,

11:26.620 --> 11:29.380
your brother is not
taking the fall...

11:29.380 --> 11:32.000
unless he loves us.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.040
I got it. I know how
we can recover the footage

11:35.040 --> 11:38.620
so Johnson doesn't know
that we deleted anything.
Okay, how?

11:38.620 --> 11:40.500
We'll recreate
the circus mission
in front of a green screen.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.420
Dad, find a camera.

11:42.420 --> 11:45.210
I'll set up the tightrope
from the kitchen island
to the couch.

11:45.210 --> 11:47.620
K.C., go put on
your most colorful
bathing suit.

11:47.620 --> 11:49.750
Marisa, how's your
Monrovian accent?

11:49.750 --> 11:52.170
[bad Monrovian accent]
It's incredible!

11:52.170 --> 11:54.210
Good enough.

11:54.210 --> 11:56.290
You'll play Lazlo,
the tightrope guy.

11:56.290 --> 11:57.380
Yes.

11:59.710 --> 12:01.330
Mom, do you still have
that ceramic tiger

12:01.330 --> 12:03.000
that you made
in your pottery class?

12:03.000 --> 12:06.330
I'm gonna need you
to stand behind it and roar.

12:06.330 --> 12:08.330
Everybody ready?
Let's do this.

12:08.330 --> 12:10.290
You know, Ernie,
I gotta say, I'm impressed.

12:10.290 --> 12:13.000
-Thank you!
-Yeah, this is the dumbest
idea you've ever had.

12:15.210 --> 12:17.790
And believe me, brother,
you have had a lot of
dumb ideas.

12:17.790 --> 12:19.420
And if you don't believe me...

12:19.420 --> 12:21.830
let's take a look.

12:21.830 --> 12:25.250
[muttering]
...some here.

12:25.250 --> 12:27.830
Our first step
is to lure Zane
out in the open.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.040
Any ideas?

12:29.040 --> 12:31.210
I know.
We'll film a commercial

12:31.210 --> 12:33.380
advertising one of
those million-dollar
sweepstake prizes.

12:33.380 --> 12:36.540
We'll pump it to Zane's cable
system a hundred times a day

12:36.540 --> 12:38.380
until he can't help
but enter the contest.

12:38.380 --> 12:40.080
Once he subscribes
to the three magazines

12:40.080 --> 12:41.380
and sends in his entry form,

12:41.380 --> 12:43.250
he'll move to
the semi-final rounds.

12:43.250 --> 12:44.880
Eventually we'll
declare him the winner,

12:44.880 --> 12:46.540
and when he comes
to collect his prize,

12:46.540 --> 12:48.670
we'll jump in and grab him
and put him in prison.

12:50.250 --> 12:52.830
Just one problem.

12:52.830 --> 12:56.210
We're gonna need one of
those giant novelty checks.

12:56.210 --> 12:59.080
Yeah...that's the one problem
with that plan.

13:00.620 --> 13:03.170
Bro, I know you're gonna
do absolutely great

13:03.170 --> 13:04.380
leading this mission.

13:04.380 --> 13:06.580
It should be
pretty easy, though.

13:06.580 --> 13:08.830
All we gotta do is break
into Nelson Monroe's condo,

13:08.830 --> 13:11.670
get the SD card containing
all the crucial information,
and then get out.

13:11.670 --> 13:14.540
That is
the standard procedure.

13:14.540 --> 13:16.750
But where's the pizzazz?

13:16.750 --> 13:18.290
The creativity?

13:18.290 --> 13:21.170
The... wow factor?

13:24.500 --> 13:26.040
Ernie, is that a...

13:26.040 --> 13:28.670
Handmade scale model
of Monroe's condo,

13:28.670 --> 13:31.040
built entirely with
popsicle sticks?

13:31.040 --> 13:33.460
Yes. Yes, it is.

13:35.290 --> 13:38.170
Oh, I forgot to...
[gasps]

13:38.170 --> 13:40.080
Brett Willis.

13:44.080 --> 13:47.080
Let me explain.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.420
There's nothing
to explain.

13:48.420 --> 13:50.920
You almost destroyed
my family.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.330
Now you will
be destroyed.

13:57.500 --> 13:58.960
Are you done?

13:58.960 --> 14:00.710
Not yet.

14:04.420 --> 14:06.750
Now I'm done.

14:06.750 --> 14:08.540
[all laughing]

14:08.540 --> 14:10.290
Oh, that's cool.

14:10.290 --> 14:12.540
I'm not
the only one who does
stupid stuff, you know.

14:12.540 --> 14:15.120
Oh, well, I sure hope
you're not referring to me.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.330
Well, if the clown shoe
fits, go ahead and wear it.

14:18.330 --> 14:19.540
Uh!

14:19.540 --> 14:20.750
Excuse me!

14:20.750 --> 14:21.960
Is anybody in this family

14:21.960 --> 14:23.710
gonna stick up
for me here?

14:23.710 --> 14:27.920
[all muttering]

14:27.920 --> 14:30.380
Seriously?
When have I ever done
something stupid?

14:30.380 --> 14:31.380
All right, people.

14:31.380 --> 14:33.330
Settle in, put your feet
up, and relax.

14:33.330 --> 14:37.170
This could be longer than
all the Harry Potter movies
put together.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.290
Phew.

14:52.120 --> 14:53.290
Good night.

14:53.290 --> 14:55.120
Hey, everybody.

14:55.120 --> 14:58.380
Um, I will be talking about
the Industrial Revolution.

14:58.380 --> 15:02.330
While today we enjoy many
of the modern conveniences,

15:02.330 --> 15:06.000
uh, that,
um, the-- the--

15:06.000 --> 15:10.670
mo-modern conveniences
that-that...

15:12.080 --> 15:15.790
[heart pounding]

15:18.710 --> 15:21.750
-[slo-mo laughter]
-[gulps]

15:21.750 --> 15:23.540
[retches]

15:26.580 --> 15:28.880
Well, you definitely
got it in the bag.

15:30.420 --> 15:32.750
Wow, you have
really soft hair.

15:33.830 --> 15:36.290
K.C., that's the bear.

15:39.420 --> 15:41.330
Oh. [chuckles]
Right.

15:41.330 --> 15:42.210
My bad.

15:44.920 --> 15:47.500
[all laughing]

15:47.500 --> 15:49.380
I'm sorry.
Was I mistaken?

15:49.380 --> 15:52.080
Was that not you
doing all those
ridiculous things?

15:52.080 --> 15:54.670
Oh, please. You're acting
like you never barfed
in a purse before.

15:54.670 --> 15:56.670
It was a laptop bag,
and you know it!

15:56.670 --> 15:57.880
Oh, does it really matter?

15:57.880 --> 15:59.420
Yes, it does matter!

15:59.420 --> 16:00.420
Okay, stay focused!

16:00.420 --> 16:01.540
And stop arguing.

16:01.540 --> 16:03.380
No, stay focused.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.250
Well, they can't focus
because they're arguing.

16:05.250 --> 16:06.540
There's not enough going on?

16:06.540 --> 16:08.330
You really want to make
an issue out of this?

16:08.330 --> 16:09.880
I don't know where they
get it from.

16:09.880 --> 16:11.290
It's not my fault those
two are always arguing.

16:11.290 --> 16:12.500
Are you saying
it's my fault?

16:12.500 --> 16:15.330
I'm saying
it's not my fault.

16:15.330 --> 16:18.960
-[both arguing]
-They don't know
where we get it from.

16:18.960 --> 16:21.120
Well, look at that.
I do!

16:21.120 --> 16:22.540
-Okay.
-Hey, give me the thing.

16:22.540 --> 16:23.880
That's all right.
We don't need to see that.

16:23.880 --> 16:24.960
There we go.

16:24.960 --> 16:27.330
And there it is.

16:30.420 --> 16:32.710
We're running out
of time, Craig.

16:32.710 --> 16:34.960
The time it takes me
to stop doing what I'm doing

16:34.960 --> 16:36.960
to listen to you say
we're running out of time

16:36.960 --> 16:39.330
is time I could be using
to figure this thing out.

16:39.330 --> 16:41.250
That's exactly
what you said

16:41.250 --> 16:44.120
when you were deactivating
that bomb in Argentina.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.290
Your eyebrows grew back,
didn't they?

16:48.170 --> 16:49.620
You always do this, Craig.

16:49.620 --> 16:52.500
Always, Kira?
I always do this?

16:52.500 --> 16:54.750
As in every time I try
to open a bank vault

16:54.750 --> 16:58.040
my kids are trapped in
while their oxygen runs out?

16:58.040 --> 16:59.330
Now, please.

16:59.330 --> 17:01.120
Give me some space.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.250
I can feel you breathing
on the back of my neck.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.120
Did you find me
anything to eat?

17:05.120 --> 17:06.580
I've been working out
for two hours, and I'm starving.

17:06.580 --> 17:08.380
I found some soup.

17:08.380 --> 17:11.420
Soup?! How am I
supposed to eat that
and keep moving, baby?

17:11.420 --> 17:12.830
Let's try.

17:12.830 --> 17:14.380
Okay, wait, wait.

17:14.380 --> 17:16.790
Be careful.
Wait, wait, wait!

17:16.790 --> 17:18.040
[both talking at once]

17:18.040 --> 17:19.420
I'm trying to do it.

17:19.420 --> 17:22.830
Wait. Wait a minute.
Now I can't see.

17:22.830 --> 17:25.420
Let me try and...
Wait, here.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.790
Slow down!

17:27.790 --> 17:29.250
If you would
bring your face down!

17:29.250 --> 17:31.170
Never mind, never mind.
I'm full.

17:31.170 --> 17:33.380
Thank you.
I'm not hungry anymore.

17:34.330 --> 17:36.540
Okay, okay, okay.

17:36.540 --> 17:39.330
Okay, so we had a few
minor disagreements.

17:39.330 --> 17:40.500
And some major ones.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.210
And some major ones.

17:42.210 --> 17:44.540
But people who really
love each other--

17:44.540 --> 17:46.790
Can argue
and still get past it.

17:46.790 --> 17:48.920
Ohh! That's right.

17:48.920 --> 17:52.040
My big, bad-- whoo!--
spy daddy!

17:52.040 --> 17:54.540
[laughter]

17:54.540 --> 17:56.540
Ecch!
That was more disgusting

17:56.540 --> 17:58.460
than when K.C.
puked in a bag.

17:59.790 --> 18:01.380
[knock on door]

18:01.380 --> 18:03.380
-Who is it?
-Agent Johnson.

18:03.380 --> 18:05.120
Ooh. We need to hide Judy.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.420
-Okay, I'll collapse her.
-It only lasts two minutes.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.750
-Why would it last two minutes?
-That's what the manual said.

18:09.750 --> 18:11.500
-Why would it say that?
-I don't know!

18:11.500 --> 18:14.460
I didn't write it,
I just read it.

18:14.460 --> 18:15.670
Well, put her foot
back on.

18:15.670 --> 18:17.830
Uh, coming!
Just one second!

18:20.830 --> 18:23.250
[whirring sound]

18:24.830 --> 18:26.920
[Judy] Ow!
I can still feel that!

18:26.920 --> 18:29.250
Sorry, my bad.

18:29.250 --> 18:30.500
Hey, what about Marisa?

18:30.500 --> 18:31.670
Shove her
under the couch too!

18:31.670 --> 18:33.620
Or I can just go out
the front door.

18:33.620 --> 18:35.420
Seriously, we haven't
talked about me in forever,

18:35.420 --> 18:37.500
so I'm so over this.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.710
Just go.

18:38.710 --> 18:40.460
Ready?

18:40.460 --> 18:41.540
Okay.

18:42.620 --> 18:44.380
Agent Johnson! My man!

18:44.380 --> 18:45.580
[happy exclamation]
Uh... okay.

18:45.580 --> 18:47.500
What you, uh,
what you doin' here?

18:47.500 --> 18:49.250
I'm here to pick up
Judy. Where is she?

18:49.250 --> 18:50.830
She's not under the couch.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.080
[nervous chuckle]

18:57.380 --> 18:58.830
Well?

18:58.830 --> 19:00.830
Well what?

19:00.830 --> 19:02.580
What is wrong
with all of you?

19:02.580 --> 19:05.670
I came here to pick up Judy
for her scheduled upload.

19:05.670 --> 19:08.580
For the last time,
where is she?

19:08.580 --> 19:11.120
Uh, she left to meet you
at the Organization

19:11.120 --> 19:12.500
an hour ago.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.460
I just came from
the Organization.

19:14.460 --> 19:15.710
She wasn't there.

19:15.710 --> 19:17.460
Excuse me, Agent Johnson,

19:17.460 --> 19:20.250
are you saying that you
don't know where Judy is?

19:20.250 --> 19:21.750
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

19:21.750 --> 19:23.500
Okay, so you're admitting
to losing

19:23.500 --> 19:26.290
a multimillion-dollar,
state-of-the-art robot.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.960
No, I didn't say
I lost her.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.250
Ohh! I get it.

19:30.250 --> 19:33.250
You're accusing us
of losing her.

19:33.250 --> 19:34.580
[overlapping chatter]

19:34.580 --> 19:35.830
No, no, I-I--

19:35.830 --> 19:38.670
Where is your proof,
Agent Johnson?

19:38.670 --> 19:40.330
Where is your proof?

19:40.330 --> 19:42.080
Where is that?

19:42.080 --> 19:43.880
You're right,
I blew it.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.460
I should probably go back
to the Organization
and look for Judy.

19:46.460 --> 19:48.420
Yeah, you probably should,

19:48.420 --> 19:50.290
but you're the boss,
so, you know, it's
your decision.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.830
Yeah. Yeah.

19:51.830 --> 19:53.960
[whirring sound]

19:53.960 --> 19:56.460
[Judy] Ow!

19:56.460 --> 19:57.540
What was that?

19:57.540 --> 19:59.170
Raccoons!

20:00.920 --> 20:02.670
Well, I am just shocked

20:02.670 --> 20:05.880
at the level of deception
in this family.

20:05.880 --> 20:08.040
I am disappointed
in all of you.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.460
Really? Well, you're
acting all innocent now,

20:10.460 --> 20:11.960
but you have pulled
plenty of your own stuff

20:11.960 --> 20:13.540
these past few years,
Miss Mouth.

20:13.540 --> 20:15.500
I don't know what
you're referring to.

20:15.500 --> 20:18.670
[incredulous chuckle]
Well, shall I play
the video for you?

20:18.670 --> 20:20.040
Oh, I think I shall.

20:20.040 --> 20:21.920
Connect your foot.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.460
[foot snaps into place]

20:27.420 --> 20:29.420
[whirring sound]

20:30.580 --> 20:32.620
[trilling sound]

20:34.830 --> 20:36.960
Hello. I'm J.U.D.Y.

20:36.960 --> 20:40.460
I'll be posing as the
adorable little sister
that everyone wished they had.

20:40.460 --> 20:43.380
But in reality,
I'm here to assist you
on missions.

20:43.380 --> 20:46.460
I can calculate the risk
of any dangerous scenario.

20:46.460 --> 20:49.170
I speak 47 languages,
and in a pinch,

20:49.170 --> 20:51.710
I can be used
as a flotation device.

20:51.710 --> 20:53.710
[K.C. laughs]

20:53.710 --> 20:56.710
What an adorable little robot.

20:56.710 --> 20:57.620
[shouts]

20:59.120 --> 21:02.670
R2D2 is a robot, honey,
I'm a J.U.D.Y.

21:02.670 --> 21:05.330
Junior Undercover Digital Youth.

21:05.330 --> 21:08.960
And do yourself
a favor, don't get all
up in my grill again.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.380
[laughs joyfully]

21:13.620 --> 21:15.580
Please, please, please.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.000
Ernie, is that you?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.710
Yes, it's me!

21:20.710 --> 21:22.000
You remember me?

21:22.000 --> 21:23.790
More important,
you remember you?

21:23.790 --> 21:26.120
Yes, of course.
I'm Judy,

21:26.120 --> 21:27.540
and you're
my big brother Ernie.

21:27.540 --> 21:28.710
[relieved sigh]

21:28.710 --> 21:30.790
Wow. I thought for a minute

21:30.790 --> 21:32.750
I'd never reprogram
you right.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.750
I'm sorry.
Reprogram me?

21:34.750 --> 21:36.290
What does that even mean?

21:36.290 --> 21:37.670
It means you were
malfunctioning,

21:37.670 --> 21:39.330
and I needed to
reprogram you.

21:39.330 --> 21:40.750
Still not following.

21:40.750 --> 21:43.420
You're a robot.

21:43.420 --> 21:45.120
I'm a robot?!

21:48.000 --> 21:50.750
[shrieking]

21:50.750 --> 21:53.210
What have you done to me?

21:53.210 --> 21:54.710
Help! Somebody help!

21:54.710 --> 21:58.170
I'm a monster!

21:58.170 --> 21:59.330
[all laughing]

21:59.330 --> 22:02.880
-She is some mess!
-Always.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.000
-Judy, what's wrong?
-Yeah, you okay?

22:05.000 --> 22:07.790
Yeah, it's just...
those are my memories.

22:07.790 --> 22:10.790
It's what makes me
a part of this family.

22:10.790 --> 22:14.380
If you delete them,
it's like you're
deleting our journey--

22:14.380 --> 22:17.080
almost like you're
deleting me.

22:17.080 --> 22:20.830
Judy, it's not about
footage on a tape, okay?

22:20.830 --> 22:22.620
It's about how we feel
about each other.

22:22.620 --> 22:24.670
Yeah, and the way we
have each other's back.

22:24.670 --> 22:26.500
The way that we
care about each other.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.790
The way we would do
anything for each other.

22:28.790 --> 22:30.790
That's what family
is about.

22:30.790 --> 22:33.460
And I promise you,
there is absolutely no one

22:33.460 --> 22:35.250
who could ever delete that.

22:35.250 --> 22:38.500
K.C., that was so
sweet and touching...

22:38.500 --> 22:40.080
and totally useless!

22:43.000 --> 22:45.040
Did you forget that
I'm a robot?

22:45.040 --> 22:48.420
Once things are deleted,
I'll never remember it again!

22:48.420 --> 22:50.790
You know, she's right.
We don't have a choice.

22:50.790 --> 22:52.290
We're just gonna have to
leave all her memories

22:52.290 --> 22:53.750
and suffer the consequences.

22:53.750 --> 22:56.250
Or we can back up all that
incriminating evidence

22:56.250 --> 22:57.790
onto a separate hard drive,

22:57.790 --> 22:59.830
send her to the Organization
for an upload,

22:59.830 --> 23:02.170
then reinstall all her
memories when she gets back.

23:02.170 --> 23:03.880
Hmm. You could have
mentioned that

23:03.880 --> 23:06.880
about an hour ago!

23:06.880 --> 23:09.750
I would have, but you kept
telling me to leave the room!

23:10.750 --> 23:12.120
No, I didn't.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.670
Really?
You don't think so?

23:13.670 --> 23:15.710
Would you like me
to replay the footage?

23:15.710 --> 23:18.750
No, no, no, no.
Just... bring it in, guys.

23:18.750 --> 23:23.250
[happy chuckles]

23:23.250 --> 23:24.750
[woman] Rob, your name's
on TV!
