Hey, how are you?

How was your vacation?

02:18.181 --> 02:19.617
Fantastic,

02:19.661 --> 02:21.184
but I needed another month.

And we think
it'll be even better

when you have
a second name partner.

-Excuse me?
-WINSTON: We want you

09:53.114 --> 09:55.246
to share responsibility.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.379
We think that'll be better
for the firm.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.424
Yeah, but the firm
is great as it is.

09:59.468 --> 10:02.602
We agree, but imagine how well
it could work with two of you.

10:03.820 --> 10:06.257
Uh, did you go hunting

10:06.301 --> 10:07.911
with Diane's husband?

10:07.955 --> 10:08.956
OSMAN:
Yes.

10:08.999 --> 10:10.610
And that's when you decided

10:10.653 --> 10:13.003
-that I needed help?
-OSMAN: No, no, that has nothing

10:13.047 --> 10:14.614

What are they doing?

12:22.567 --> 12:24.265
-Measuring.
-Why?

12:24.308 --> 12:26.920
NAME PARTNER:
To see which office is bigger.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.312
Uh, who chooses the art?

12:28.356 --> 12:29.661
-I don't know.
-I see.

12:29.705 --> 12:31.359
-20 feet.
-By 18.

12:31.402 --> 12:34.231
Okay, not great.
Let's try in here.

12:37.669 --> 12:39.976
How many floors?

12:40.020 --> 12:42.239
Uh... does Liz know
you're doing this?

12:42.283 --> 12:43.545
Who's Liz?

12:43.588 --> 12:44.807
JULIUS:
The other name partner.

12:44.851 --> 12:45.852
Yeah, she knows.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.636
Um, how many floors are there?

12:47.679 --> 12:50.813
Associate's floor downstairs,
STR Laurie upstairs.

12:50.857 --> 12:53.947
Think in terms
of breaking down walls.

12:53.990 --> 12:56.166
No, no, no, no. I-I don't know
exactly what it is

12:56.210 --> 12:58.821
you think you're doing,
but I think we should call Liz.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.867
Adriano, go downstairs and

13:00.910 --> 13:02.564
tell the associates
to come on up here.

13:02.607 --> 13:04.044
We'll use, uh, this...

13:04.087 --> 13:07.047
space in the meantime. Um...

13:07.090 --> 13:09.179
What is your name?

13:09.223 --> 13:11.573
Julius Cain.
I'm a partner. Yours?

13:11.616 --> 13:13.488
Ri'Chard.

13:13.531 --> 13:14.663
Hands.

13:17.057 --> 13:18.275
Julius, hands.

13:18.319 --> 13:19.842
What is this?

13:19.886 --> 13:21.322
Giving Him honor.

13:25.761 --> 13:27.284
[clears throat]

13:27.328 --> 13:30.244
We thank you, God,
for this opportunity.

13:30.287 --> 13:33.203
We are, as always,
your humble servants.

13:33.247 --> 13:36.598
We plan to kick ass
in your name.

13:36.641 --> 13:38.687
We ask Jesus to bless

13:38.730 --> 13:39.949
this place.

13:39.993 --> 13:41.821
And in your name we pray.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.040
-ASSISTANTS: Amen.
-Break! [whoops]

13:44.084 --> 13:45.999
[drills whirring]

13:46.042 --> 13:47.565
[line ringing]

13:47.609 --> 13:49.480
Come on, Liz.

13:49.524 --> 13:51.091
-[cell phone buzzing]
-LIZ: Wait a minute,
Miss Dormer,

13:51.134 --> 13:52.222
I'm sorry, wait a minute.

13:52.266 --> 13:53.658
These are all options

13:53.702 --> 13:54.964
that you could've chosen.

13:55.008 --> 13:57.097
I didn't know
what I was choosing.

13:57.140 --> 13:59.142
Miss Dormer,
what does that say up there?

13:59.186 --> 14:00.491
Go ahead, read it.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.015
WILLOW:
"Click the body type

14:02.058 --> 14:04.191
-you want."
-LIZ: "If you change your mind,

14:04.234 --> 14:06.497
just delete and start again."
Did you really

14:06.541 --> 14:08.978
-not know what that meant?
-I'm new to all this.

14:09.022 --> 14:10.414
[clears throat]

14:14.027 --> 14:16.377
You may want to go a bit easier.
We don't want to lose the judge.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.553
Well, when you cross,
you can do it your way.

14:18.596 --> 14:19.902
And yet,

14:19.946 --> 14:22.644
Miss Dormer, you
chose the sexiest avatar,

14:22.687 --> 14:24.472
with the largest breasts

14:24.515 --> 14:26.604
-and these clothes.
-WILLIAM: Objection.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.432
-"Counselor is testifying."
-Counselor is testifying,
Your Honor.

14:28.476 --> 14:30.565
"That's not testifying,
that's describing."

14:30.608 --> 14:32.175
LIZ:
This is not testifying,
Your Honor.

14:32.219 --> 14:33.524
I am merely describing
what is here.

14:33.568 --> 14:35.439
WILLIAM:
Your Honor, this is blaming

14:35.483 --> 14:37.224
the victim, pure and simple.

14:37.267 --> 14:39.443
-I am merely setting out...
-We're talking about an assault.

14:39.487 --> 14:41.532
-Stop, stop. Stop!
-[Liz and William
continue arguing]

14:41.576 --> 14:43.795
-"One at a time."
-One at a time.

14:43.839 --> 14:45.972
-[Liz and William
continue arguing]
-Diane, do you have a minute?

14:47.277 --> 14:49.366
I think William Schultz
just brought in

14:49.410 --> 14:51.847
some metaverse goggles
and a haptic suit.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.588
You think he's gonna
have the judge try them on?

14:53.631 --> 14:56.025
Yes. We should at least object
about the haptic suit.

14:56.069 --> 14:57.722
Was Willow wearing one?

14:57.766 --> 14:59.594
When she was attacked? Yes, but

14:59.637 --> 15:01.465
we don't know at what setting,
and that leaves a lot of room

15:01.509 --> 15:03.511
-for manipulation.
-Got it.

15:03.554 --> 15:04.904
Uh, Diane.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.993
I heard you in court.
Are you okay?

15:08.951 --> 15:11.606
Have you ever heard
of déjà vécu?

15:11.649 --> 15:13.695
-Déjà vu?
-No, vécu.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.523
It's-it's not just a moment.

15:15.566 --> 15:17.394
-It's a whole day.
-Groundhog Day?

15:17.438 --> 15:19.266
Yeah, something like that.

15:19.309 --> 15:20.963
Liz and I have
been through this...

15:21.007 --> 15:22.704
moment before,
and I have no idea

15:22.747 --> 15:24.662
-how to get out of it.
-Maybe you shouldn't try.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.708
Maybe it's your superpower.

15:29.580 --> 15:31.191
MARISSA:
Carmen, guess what.

15:31.234 --> 15:33.715
No, you have to guess.
No, I'm not gonna tell you.

15:33.758 --> 15:37.675
-Uh, Marissa,
I-I can't talk right now.
-I did exactly

15:37.719 --> 15:39.677
what you said
and Diane gave me the motion.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.070
I'm arguing it in an hour.

15:41.114 --> 15:43.594
Marissa, I have to go.

15:43.638 --> 15:45.509
Okay, call me back.
I need some advice.

15:56.607 --> 15:59.349
Carmen. Hello.

15:59.393 --> 16:01.786
It is so good to see you.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.614
-Thank you.
-Mr. Lester?

16:03.658 --> 16:05.790
I'm sorry you had to be
brought in this way,

16:05.834 --> 16:08.184
but my client worries
his whereabouts

16:08.228 --> 16:10.447
will be communicated
to the police.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.449
I assured him
that we could trust you,

16:12.493 --> 16:14.495
but he wanted to meet you first.

16:14.538 --> 16:17.933
So, this is Ben-Baruch.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.198
She's Black.

16:22.242 --> 16:24.287
CHARLES:
Yes, but that's a good thing.

16:24.331 --> 16:26.028
I recommended you

16:26.072 --> 16:29.466
to Ben because we believe
the feds are coming after him

16:29.510 --> 16:31.512
for a murder he didn't commit.

16:31.555 --> 16:34.036
-BEN-BARUCH:
Where were you born?
-Bakersfield.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.344
How long have you been a lawyer?

16:37.387 --> 16:39.389
Eight months.

16:39.433 --> 16:42.827
CHARLES:
Her inexperience is a feature,

16:42.871 --> 16:44.264
not a bug.

16:44.307 --> 16:45.787
Talk to Rivi.

16:47.441 --> 16:48.920
Gal.

16:52.489 --> 16:54.274
[sighs]

16:54.317 --> 16:56.928
This is the evidence against me.

16:56.972 --> 16:59.714
I need to decide whether
to fly to Brazil or stay.

16:59.757 --> 17:02.021
He needs to know
if his case is winnable.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.545
If it's not, he'd rather leave.

17:04.588 --> 17:06.634
[cell phone rings]

17:14.468 --> 17:15.904
Marissa.

17:15.947 --> 17:16.905
MAN:
The government is making you

17:16.948 --> 17:19.647
suck dick or go to prison!

17:19.690 --> 17:22.737
Go to prison! Fascists!

17:22.780 --> 17:24.695
Carmen, I'm ready
for the continuance.

17:24.739 --> 17:25.914
I just need some advice.

17:25.957 --> 17:27.698
Marissa, you'll be fine.

17:27.742 --> 17:29.700
You've been doing this for
six months at Wackner's court.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.267
I know, I just want to know
how much to turn on the heat.

17:31.311 --> 17:32.529
You'll know
as soon as you start.

17:32.573 --> 17:34.140
Marissa, I-I really have to go.

17:34.183 --> 17:35.402
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:35.445 --> 17:38.013
Marissa, we'll-we'll talk, yeah?

17:38.057 --> 17:40.494
COURT CLERK:
Safred Corp v. Lila Royce.

17:40.537 --> 17:42.365
Parties please
approach the bench.

17:42.409 --> 17:43.975
[indistinct chatter]

17:44.019 --> 17:45.803
What is this, a continuance?

17:45.847 --> 17:47.544
Yes, Your Honor,
and I would like to, uh,

17:47.588 --> 17:49.155
remind the court
that this is the third

17:49.198 --> 17:50.852
continuance requested

17:50.895 --> 17:52.158
by the defense.

17:52.201 --> 17:54.203
HANDGROVE:
I believe that is true.

17:54.247 --> 17:58.120
Not sure why I'm granting
a third continuance, counselor.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.296
[sirens wailing outside]

18:08.565 --> 18:10.437
Hello?

18:10.480 --> 18:12.352
Uh...

18:16.095 --> 18:18.097
HANDGROVE:
Okay, continuance denied.

18:18.140 --> 18:21.404
Let's reconvene Thursday
for trial.

18:21.448 --> 18:22.710
[gavel bangs]

18:24.103 --> 18:26.453
It's the, uh, yips.

18:26.496 --> 18:28.281
Happens to the best of us.

18:29.412 --> 18:31.936
Thank you for your
arguments, counselors.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.460
And for your testimony, ma'am.
I am prone

18:33.503 --> 18:35.462
to grant the defense's motion
to dismiss...

18:35.505 --> 18:36.724
-Your Honor.
-DAVIES: No, counselor.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.552
This is not an assault.

18:38.595 --> 18:40.162
And do you know how I know?

18:40.206 --> 18:42.164
Because it didn't happen.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.732
And your client could've
just as easily taken off

18:44.775 --> 18:47.430
-her goggles.
-Your Honor, we ask
for a brief demonstration.

18:47.474 --> 18:48.475
-Objection.
-Objection. Your Honor...

18:48.518 --> 18:50.433
What kind of demonstration?

18:50.477 --> 18:51.869
The best way for Your Honor
to understand what Willow

18:51.913 --> 18:54.481
went through is to
follow in her footsteps.

18:54.524 --> 18:56.091
-A demonstration
cannot accurately...
-There's too much room

18:56.135 --> 18:57.484
-for manipulation, Your Honor.
-WILLIAM: Look,

18:57.527 --> 18:59.007
we can connect the goggles
to the court TV.

18:59.050 --> 19:01.531
Then everyone can see
it's above board.

19:01.575 --> 19:02.837
DIANE:
Your Honor, this is crazy.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.100
You have appropriately whetted

19:05.144 --> 19:07.058
my interest.
Let me see those things.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.456
-Let go. I will...
-No, I can...
I will choose the avatar.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.937
-be more than happy to do it.
-We represent Chumhum.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.330
-I understand. Let me...
-This is... I think

19:17.373 --> 19:18.374
if you're gonna do
the demonstration...

19:18.418 --> 19:20.202
Okay, stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.162
I will choose my own avatar.

19:38.002 --> 19:39.090
Uh... [sighs]

19:40.657 --> 19:42.398
Your Honor, I must object.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.095
That look is too provocative.

19:44.139 --> 19:45.314
It's not provocative enough.

19:45.358 --> 19:48.187
Just shut up, everybody.

19:49.579 --> 19:50.798
All right, what happens now?

19:50.841 --> 19:52.321
I'm gonna give you
the haptic suit.

19:52.365 --> 19:53.931
It lets you feel
what you're seeing.

19:53.975 --> 19:56.020
You can put it on
over your robe.

19:56.064 --> 19:58.240
-DIANE: Your Honor, we object
to the haptic suit.
-All right.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.068
[Velcro rips]

20:00.111 --> 20:01.548
Well...

20:01.591 --> 20:03.898
Now I feel like an idiot.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.726
All right, what's next?

20:07.075 --> 20:08.685
DAVIES and AVATAR:
Oh.

20:08.729 --> 20:10.861
Look at all this.

20:10.905 --> 20:13.516
Oh, well, this is very different
than anything... [laughs]

Ah, listen to how sexy I am.

Oh.

Happy birthday, Mr. President.

Do you need help there,
young miss?

20:27.051 --> 20:28.531
Oh, he can hear me.

RI'CHARD:
Okay.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.486
This is how this works.

21:10.530 --> 21:11.922
Whoever receives the golf ball

21:11.966 --> 21:15.099
has five seconds
to say what they hate

21:15.143 --> 21:16.927
about this firm.

21:16.971 --> 21:19.321
If you take longer,
you're fired.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.670
-Are you serious?
-Sir,

21:20.714 --> 21:22.368
you have to learn
one thing about me.

-I am never not serious.

What do you hate
about this firm?
