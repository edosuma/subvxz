They don't fit,

01:16.534 --> 01:19.534
and your ad said,
"We fit every foot."

01:19.534 --> 01:22.367
Yes, ma'am, but our problem is
what we're dealing with

01:22.367 --> 01:24.667
is not what Webster meant
by "feet."

01:24.667 --> 01:26.701
Now, let's face it, girls,

01:26.701 --> 01:30.434
what we've got here
are rib roasts with nails.

01:30.434 --> 01:31.834
Now, what I would suggest

01:31.834 --> 01:34.234
is surrounding your tootsies
with those little brown potatoes

01:34.234 --> 01:36.501
wrapped in foil
and serve with dry wine.

01:36.501 --> 01:37.601
Oh!

01:37.601 --> 01:38.868
Well!

01:48.367 --> 01:49.501
Oh, over here, dear.

01:49.501 --> 01:51.400
Just put them anywhere.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.501
Hi, Al.

01:52.501 --> 01:54.167
Honey, you would've been
so proud of me.

01:54.167 --> 01:58.834
I spent every penny you have,
but not a cent more.

01:58.834 --> 02:01.067
Now I need a little tip
for Alejandro.

02:01.067 --> 02:03.601
Sure. Don't touch my wife.

02:06.234 --> 02:08.633
Kmart, tomorrow,
10-ish.

02:08.633 --> 02:11.133
Peg, I understand
your great need to shop.

02:11.133 --> 02:12.868
After all,
you have to do something

02:12.868 --> 02:15.400
to break up
that nothing you do at home,

02:15.400 --> 02:16.534
but, you know,

02:16.534 --> 02:19.300
as I was vacuuming
my shirt this morning,

02:19.300 --> 02:21.968
I said to myself,
"Hey, I got a wife. I have to.

02:21.968 --> 02:25.334
Why else would I not care
about my health?"

02:25.334 --> 02:26.567
What's your point, Al?

02:26.567 --> 02:29.133
I don't have
any clean shirts, Peg.

02:29.133 --> 02:31.367
Do what I do,
buy a new one.

02:31.367 --> 02:34.133
Well, I would have,
but I didn't want to wake you,

02:34.133 --> 02:36.601
prying my wallet
out of your claws.

02:36.601 --> 02:38.067
Let's try this,

02:38.067 --> 02:41.200
pretend the mall closes at 3,
go home and clean my clothes.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.267
What am I being punished for?

02:44.934 --> 02:47.801
Okay, Al, I'll do the wash,

02:47.801 --> 02:49.434
but first,
give me some more money.

02:49.434 --> 02:51.133
I need quarters for the machine.

02:51.133 --> 02:53.133
Hey, you're not gonna get me
with that one twice.

02:53.133 --> 02:54.000
We own that machine.

02:57.100 --> 02:59.601
I don't wanna do the wash, Al.

02:59.601 --> 03:02.801
There's nothing to buy there.

03:02.801 --> 03:04.234
I know, let's compromise.

03:04.234 --> 03:06.267
Gimme some money,
and on your way home,

03:06.267 --> 03:09.400
you can pick up Chinese food,
and we'll have a nice dinner.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.767
Peg, I'm serious.
Look at this shirt.

03:11.767 --> 03:14.434
It doesn't show up in a mirror.

03:14.434 --> 03:16.300
Now, go home, do the wash.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.834
Until then, you're cut off,
understand? No money.

03:18.834 --> 03:20.634
Yes, Al.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.033
Now, if you'll excuse me,

03:22.033 --> 03:24.834
the sun is setting,
and my shirt wants to party.

03:24.834 --> 03:26.234
I have to put these shoes away.

03:56.033 --> 03:58.100
Better take something
for that cough, Peg.

03:58.100 --> 04:00.400
Oh, I already did.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.767
Honey, I'm gonna go home now

04:03.767 --> 04:06.667

doing your laundry.

Guess what I just saw.

04:25.234 --> 04:27.534
A mother
with her children.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.267
No.

04:29.267 --> 04:30.667
Al, I just saw Elvis.

04:30.667 --> 04:31.968
Elvis who, Peg?

04:31.968 --> 04:33.801
Elvis Presley.

04:33.801 --> 04:35.100
The King.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.868
The Pelvis.

04:36.868 --> 04:38.968
Peg, let me explain
three things to you.

04:38.968 --> 04:41.334
Number one, Elvis is dead.

04:41.334 --> 04:43.567
Number two, Elvis wasn't
any good when he was alive.

04:43.567 --> 04:45.200
And number three,
if he was alive,

04:45.200 --> 04:48.000
he'd want you to clean my shirt.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.200
You don't believe me?

04:49.200 --> 04:50.400
As much as I believed you

04:50.400 --> 04:52.133
when you told me
cleaning promotes heart disease.

04:52.133 --> 04:54.100
Well, that was a mistake.

04:54.100 --> 04:55.133
They meant smoking,

04:55.133 --> 04:57.334
but I didn't want
to quit smoking.

04:57.334 --> 04:59.801
Honey, I really did.
I just saw Elvis.

04:59.801 --> 05:01.767
There's only one dead guy
in the mall, Peg,

05:01.767 --> 05:03.601
and you're looking at him.

05:03.601 --> 05:05.901
Now, go home
and clean my shirt!

05:05.901 --> 05:08.267
Al, I saw Elvis.

05:08.267 --> 05:10.567
And if it turns out
that it really was him,

05:10.567 --> 05:13.667
I want you to give me $500.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.367
Peg, if it turns out
to be Elvis,

05:15.367 --> 05:17.167
I'll give you everything I have.

05:17.167 --> 05:19.234
I'd rather have $500.

05:21.067 --> 05:22.767
So I searched
every store in the mall,

05:22.767 --> 05:24.801
but Elvis was gone.

05:24.801 --> 05:26.634
I know it was him, Marcy.

05:26.634 --> 05:29.267
He looked just like he did
when they buried him.

05:29.267 --> 05:32.601
I loved Elvis.
I wish he were alive.

05:32.601 --> 05:35.601
He's the one person
I'd cheat on Steve with.

Well...him and
Boom Boom Mancini.

05:40.834 --> 05:43.167
I'm telling you, Marcy,
I saw him.

05:43.167 --> 05:45.534
Look, Peggy, a lot of people
think they saw Elvis.

05:45.534 --> 05:47.968
He was an idol, a sex symbol.

05:47.968 --> 05:49.667
And with men
what they are today,

05:49.667 --> 05:51.834
is it any wonder
we look to the dead

05:51.834 --> 05:54.267
for a little excitement.

05:54.267 --> 05:55.901
Believe me, Peggy,

more than I do.

05:58.701 --> 06:00.701
I've been to Graceland.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.567

is Elvis is dead,

06:43.734 --> 06:46.167
and we should get on
with our lives.

06:46.167 --> 06:47.167

06:50.834 --> 06:54.667
that you just had more sex
today in this house

06:54.667 --> 06:58.834
than I've had
in 16 years of marriage...

married to Elvis?

be right.

08:10.434 --> 08:13.234
The numbing in the fingers
is only temporary.

08:13.234 --> 08:15.434
It's caused by

Did he really
give you a massage?

12:15.367 --> 12:18.033
Well, it was more like
he kind of bumped into me,

12:18.033 --> 12:20.133
but, you know,
when you're married to Al,

12:20.133 --> 12:22.434
that <i>is</i> a massage.

12:22.434 --> 12:24.334
Go on, go on.

Well, his exact words were,
"Excuse me, ma'am,"

Oh, I envy you, Peggy.

12:48.534 --> 12:49.901
My only brush with destiny

12:49.901 --> 12:52.801
was when Clark Gable
came to me in a dream and said,

12:52.801 --> 12:56.367
"Keep your own teeth
as long as you can."

burst, and I woke up.

how Elvis sneered
