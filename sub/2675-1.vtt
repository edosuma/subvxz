02:27.816 --> 02:29.235
Mother... shittin'...

02:29.318 --> 02:30.736
son of a...

02:30.819 --> 02:32.738
Ass! Ooh!

02:32.821 --> 02:34.198
I just...

02:40.120 --> 02:41.539
I was told...

02:41.622 --> 02:43.207
Have you seen...
I was told that if...

02:43.290 --> 02:46.210
I was late again I would be
summarily dismissed.

03:35.885 --> 03:37.595
Mmm. No, no.

03:54.069 --> 03:55.529
Just a moment.

03:56.864 --> 03:59.366
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

03:59.450 --> 04:00.743
Just a moment.

04:01.994 --> 04:04.330
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

04:04.413 --> 04:05.831
Just a moment.

04:07.833 --> 04:10.169
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

04:10.252 --> 04:11.587
Just a moment.

04:12.630 --> 04:14.673
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

04:15.549 --> 04:17.009
Just a moment.

04:17.091 --> 04:19.094
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

04:19.928 --> 04:22.223
Hello, Peter. What's happening?

04:22.306 --> 04:25.434
Ahh... we have
sort of a problem here.

04:25.518 --> 04:27.937
Yeah.
You apparently didn't put...

04:28.020 --> 04:30.356
one of the new cover sheets
on your T.P.S. reports.

04:30.439 --> 04:34.276
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about that.
I... I forgot.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.195
Mmm... yeah.

04:36.278 --> 04:37.738
You see, we're putting
the cover sheets...

04:37.821 --> 04:40.699
on all T.P.S. reports now
before they go out.

04:40.783 --> 04:43.536
Did you see the memo
about this?

04:43.619 --> 04:46.872
Yeah. Yeah,
I have the memo right here.

04:46.956 --> 04:48.374
I just, uh, forgot...

04:48.457 --> 04:50.835
but, uh, it's not shipping out
till tomorrow...

04:50.918 --> 04:52.336
so there's no problem.

04:52.419 --> 04:54.171
Yeah.

04:54.255 --> 04:55.631
If you could just go ahead
and make sure...

04:55.714 --> 04:58.884
you do that from now on,
that would be great...

04:58.968 --> 05:00.886
and, uh, I'll go ahead
and make sure...

05:00.970 --> 05:03.097
you get another copy
of that memo, OK?

05:03.180 --> 05:06.183
No. I have the memo.
I've got it... It's right...

05:06.267 --> 05:08.853
Hello, Phil. What's happening?

05:08.936 --> 05:10.020
Um...

05:10.104 --> 05:13.148
I came by here yesterday...

05:13.232 --> 05:16.068
Four teams
out on the Spanish point...

05:16.151 --> 05:18.320
discovered a shipwreck
off the coast...

05:18.404 --> 05:19.572
Milton?

05:20.489 --> 05:21.740
Hi. Uh...

05:21.824 --> 05:23.826
could you turn that down
just a little bit?

05:23.909 --> 05:26.120
But I was told
that I could listen...

05:26.203 --> 05:28.831
to the radio at a reasonable
volume from 9:00 to 11:00.

05:28.914 --> 05:31.417
Yeah. I know you're allowed to.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.879
I was just thinkin'
maybe like a personal favor.

05:34.962 --> 05:38.591
Well, I... I... I told Bill
if Sandra's going to...

05:38.674 --> 05:42.094
listen to her headphones
while she's filing...

05:42.178 --> 05:43.762
then I should be able
to listen to the radio...

05:43.846 --> 05:45.264
while I'm collating...

05:45.347 --> 05:47.349
so I don't see why I should have
to turn down the radio.

05:47.433 --> 05:48.517
Yeah. All right. OK.

05:48.601 --> 05:50.728
I enjoy listening
at a reasonable volume...

05:50.811 --> 05:51.896
Thanks.

05:51.979 --> 05:53.314
from 9:00 to 11:00.

05:53.397 --> 05:54.815
Hi, Peter.

05:54.899 --> 05:56.859
What's happening?

05:56.942 --> 05:59.445
We need to talk
about your T.P.S. reports.

05:59.528 --> 06:01.864
Yeah. The cover sheet.
I know. I know.

06:01.947 --> 06:03.032
Bill talked to me about it.

06:03.115 --> 06:05.659
Yeah. Did you get that memo?

06:05.743 --> 06:07.995
Yeah, I got the memo,
and I understand the policy...

06:08.078 --> 06:10.664
and the problem is just
that I forgot the one time...

06:10.748 --> 06:12.583
and I've already
taken care of it...

06:12.666 --> 06:14.376
so it's not even really
a problem anymore.

06:14.460 --> 06:17.254
Ah! Yeah.

06:17.338 --> 06:18.839
It's just we're putting
new cover sheets...

06:18.923 --> 06:21.342
on all the T.P.S. reports
before they go out now...

06:21.425 --> 06:23.802
so if you could go ahead
and try to remember...

06:23.886 --> 06:26.472
to do that from now on,
that'd be great.

06:26.555 --> 06:27.723
All right!

06:32.478 --> 06:34.313
Just a moment.

06:35.731 --> 06:38.192
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

06:38.275 --> 06:39.485
Peter Gibbons.

06:40.569 --> 06:41.654
Yes.

06:41.737 --> 06:43.614
Corporate accounts
payable. Nina speaking.

06:43.697 --> 06:44.782
Just a moment.

06:44.865 --> 06:46.283
I have the memo.

06:48.202 --> 06:50.120
No. Not again. I...

06:50.204 --> 06:52.498
Why does it say paper jam
when there is no paper jam?

06:52.581 --> 06:54.542
I swear to God,
one of these days...

06:54.625 --> 06:57.670
I just kick this piece of shit
out the window.

06:57.753 --> 06:59.672
You and me both, man.

06:59.755 --> 07:00.965
That thing is lucky
I'm not armed.

07:03.384 --> 07:04.426
Piece of shit.

07:04.510 --> 07:06.387
"Samir...

07:07.263 --> 07:08.973
"Na-Na...

07:09.056 --> 07:10.808
"Na-Naga..."

07:10.891 --> 07:12.643
- No. Thanks.
- Unh-huh!

07:12.726 --> 07:13.978
Please.

07:14.061 --> 07:17.147
"Michael... Bolton"?

07:17.231 --> 07:18.399
That's me.

07:18.482 --> 07:20.568
Wow! Is that your real name?

07:20.651 --> 07:22.069
Yeah. Ahem.

07:22.695 --> 07:24.905
So are you related
to that singer guy?

07:24.989 --> 07:26.782
No.
It's just a coincidence.

07:26.866 --> 07:28.033
Oh.

07:29.869 --> 07:32.746
No one in this country
can pronounce my name right.

07:33.539 --> 07:34.957
It's not that hard.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.168
"Na-ee" and then "anajaad."
Nayanajaad.

07:37.251 --> 07:39.253
At least your name
isn't Michael Bolton.

07:40.421 --> 07:42.131
You know, there's
nothing wrong with that name.

07:42.214 --> 07:44.133
There was
nothing wrong with it...

07:44.216 --> 07:45.885
until I was
about twelve years old...

07:45.968 --> 07:48.179
and that no-talent
ass clown became famous...

07:48.262 --> 07:49.388
and started winning Grammys.

07:49.471 --> 07:50.556
Hmm.

07:50.639 --> 07:54.643
Well, why don't you just go
by Mike instead of Michael?

07:54.727 --> 07:56.896
Why should I change?
He's the one who sucks.

07:57.229 --> 07:58.314
Hey, guys.

07:58.397 --> 07:59.982
What's up, G?

08:00.065 --> 08:01.984
Wanna go to Chotchkie's,
get some coffee?

08:02.067 --> 08:03.569
Oh, it's a little early.

08:03.652 --> 08:06.030
I gotta get outta here.
I think I'm gonna lose it.

08:06.113 --> 08:07.198
Uh-oh.

08:07.281 --> 08:10.117
Sounds like somebody's
got a case of the Mondays.

08:14.997 --> 08:17.166
Boy, I tell ya, some days.

08:17.249 --> 08:19.251
One of these days,
it's just gonna be like...

08:22.129 --> 08:23.255
Heh heh heh!

08:23.339 --> 08:25.257
So, can I get you gentlemen
something more to drink...

08:25.341 --> 08:26.425
or maybe something
to nibble on...

08:26.509 --> 08:29.011
some pizza shooters, shrimp
poppers, or extreme fajitas?

08:29.762 --> 08:31.055
- Just coffee.
- OK!

08:31.138 --> 08:32.972
Sounds like a case
of the Mondays.

08:37.895 --> 08:41.815
What if we're still doin' this
when we're fifty?

08:41.899 --> 08:44.568
It would be nice to have
that kind of job security.

08:45.402 --> 08:46.820
Lumbergh's gonna have me work
on Saturday.

08:46.904 --> 08:48.822
I can tell already.

08:48.906 --> 08:50.991
I'm gonna end up doin' it,
because, uh...

08:51.075 --> 08:52.868
because I'm a big pussy...

08:52.952 --> 08:54.995
which is why I work
at Initech to begin with.

08:55.079 --> 08:56.705
Uh, yeah, well,
I work at Initech...

08:56.789 --> 08:58.833
and I don't consider myself
a pussy, OK?

08:58.916 --> 09:01.252
Yes. I am also not a pussy.

09:01.335 --> 09:03.462
They're gonna find out
the hard way I'm not a pussy...

09:03.546 --> 09:05.172
if they don't start treating
their software people better.

09:05.256 --> 09:06.799
That's right.

09:06.882 --> 09:08.467
They don't understand.

09:08.551 --> 09:10.636
I could program a virus that'd
rip that place off big time.

09:10.719 --> 09:12.263
Yeah.

09:12.346 --> 09:13.514
Big time.

09:15.266 --> 09:16.475
Whoa!

09:16.559 --> 09:17.726
There she is.

09:18.811 --> 09:21.397
Peter, you know,
you always talk about this girl.

09:22.231 --> 09:24.483
If you're so obsessed with her,
why don't you just ask her out?

09:24.567 --> 09:25.734
Oh, I can't do that.

09:26.694 --> 09:27.987
I'm just another
asshole customer.

09:28.070 --> 09:30.614
You can't just walk up
to a waitress and ask her out.

09:30.698 --> 09:32.741
Besides, I'm still trying
to work it out with Anne.

09:33.576 --> 09:36.495
Oh, that reminds me.
I can't play poker on Friday.

09:36.579 --> 09:37.913
Why not?

09:37.997 --> 09:42.001
I'm gonna see this occupational
hypnotherapist with Anne.

09:42.084 --> 09:44.420
Dude,
an occupational hypnotherapist?

09:44.503 --> 09:46.881
I know. Anne wants me to go.

09:46.964 --> 09:48.257
She thinks it might help.

09:49.091 --> 09:50.926
Um...

09:51.010 --> 09:53.387
You know,
sometimes I think that...

09:53.470 --> 09:55.973
I get thinking
that she's cheating on me.

09:56.056 --> 09:57.474
Yeah. I know what you mean.

09:57.558 --> 09:59.059
Yeah.

10:00.269 --> 10:01.437
What is that supposed to mean?

10:02.771 --> 10:03.939
Nothing.

10:04.982 --> 10:07.151
Why don't you just tell Anne
that you're not into hypnosis...

10:07.234 --> 10:08.319
and you wanna play poker
with us?

10:08.402 --> 10:09.987
I can't do that.
She'll get all pissed off...

10:10.070 --> 10:14.408
and, besides, I think the guy
might actually be able to help.

10:14.491 --> 10:16.076
I mean,
he did help Anne lose weight.

10:16.952 --> 10:18.329
Peter, she's anorexic.

10:18.412 --> 10:20.164
Yeah, I know.

10:20.247 --> 10:21.582
The guy's really good.

10:22.750 --> 10:25.252
Yeah, well, I don't think any
occupational hypnotherapist...

10:25.336 --> 10:27.004
is gonna help you solve
any of your problems.

10:27.087 --> 10:28.839
Hey, and speaking of problems...

10:28.923 --> 10:30.382
what's this I hear about you
having problems...

10:30.466 --> 10:31.675
with your T.P.S. reports?

10:31.759 --> 10:34.136
Yeah. Didn't you get that memo?

10:36.555 --> 10:38.349
Hey! Hey, guys! Peter!

10:38.432 --> 10:40.059
Is that Smykowski?

10:40.893 --> 10:42.061
- Samir!
- What's he doing?

10:42.144 --> 10:43.812
Oh, probably workin' on
another heart attack.

10:43.896 --> 10:45.648
I've been lookin'
all over for you guys!

10:45.731 --> 10:48.484
Have you seen this?
I knew it. I knew it.

10:48.567 --> 10:50.194
What?
It's a staff meeting. So what?

10:50.277 --> 10:52.821
So what?
We're all screwed. That's what.

10:52.905 --> 10:54.532
They're gonna downsize Initech.

10:54.615 --> 10:56.825
What are you talking
about? How do you know that?

10:56.909 --> 10:59.161
How do I know? They're
bringing in a consultant.

10:59.245 --> 11:00.329
That's how I know.

11:00.412 --> 11:02.122
That's what this staff meeting's
all about.

11:02.206 --> 11:03.999
It happened
at Initrode last year.

11:04.083 --> 11:05.835
You have to interview
with this consultant.

11:05.918 --> 11:07.670
They call them
efficiency experts...

11:07.753 --> 11:08.879
but what you're really doing...

11:08.963 --> 11:10.339
is interviewing
for your own job.

11:10.422 --> 11:11.715
Every week you say
you're gonna lose your job...

11:11.799 --> 11:12.967
and you're still here.

11:13.050 --> 11:15.427
Not this time. I bet
I'm the first one laid off.

11:15.511 --> 11:17.638
The thought of having to go to
the state unemployment office...

11:17.721 --> 11:19.765
and stand in line
with those scumbags...

11:19.849 --> 11:21.225
Shit.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.228
You know there are people
in this world...

11:24.311 --> 11:26.730
that don't have to put up
with all this shit?

11:26.814 --> 11:28.983
Like that guy
that invented the pet rock.

11:29.817 --> 11:32.236
You see,
that's what you have to do.

11:33.070 --> 11:35.155
You have to use your mind...

11:35.239 --> 11:37.324
and come up with some really
great idea like that...

11:37.408 --> 11:39.702
and you can make millions...
never have to work again.

11:39.785 --> 11:41.912
You think the pet rock
was a really great idea?

11:41.996 --> 11:43.831
Sure it was.

11:43.914 --> 11:46.041
The guy made a million dollars.

11:48.627 --> 11:51.380
You know, I had an idea
like that once...

11:51.463 --> 11:52.923
a long time ago.

11:54.091 --> 11:55.551
Really? What was it, Tom?

11:56.260 --> 11:58.137
Well, all right.

11:58.220 --> 12:02.224
It was
a "Jump to Conclusions" mat.

12:03.809 --> 12:06.103
You see, it would be this mat...

12:06.187 --> 12:08.355
that you would
put on the floor...

12:08.439 --> 12:12.651
and it would have different
conclusions written on it...

12:12.735 --> 12:15.029
that you could jump to.

12:20.075 --> 12:22.328
That is the worst idea
I've ever heard in my life, Tom.

12:22.411 --> 12:26.123
Yes. Yes, it's horrible,
this idea.

12:28.584 --> 12:30.169
Uh, look...

12:30.252 --> 12:31.587
I gotta get outta here.

12:32.421 --> 12:33.422
I'll see you guys later...

12:33.506 --> 12:35.424
if I still have a job.

12:36.258 --> 12:37.343
Yeah.

12:37.426 --> 12:39.220
Our high school
guidance counselor...

12:39.303 --> 12:41.639
used to ask us what you would do
if you had a million dollars...

12:41.722 --> 12:42.806
didn't have to work...

12:42.890 --> 12:46.101
and whatever you'd say
was supposed to be your career.

12:46.185 --> 12:47.645
So if you wanted
to fix old cars...

12:47.728 --> 12:49.480
then you're supposed
to be an auto mechanic.

12:49.563 --> 12:50.648
So what did you say?

12:50.731 --> 12:52.608
I never had an answer.

12:53.567 --> 12:55.319
I guess that's why
I'm working at Initech.

12:55.402 --> 12:56.862
No. You're working at Initech...

12:56.946 --> 12:59.031
'cause that question
is bullshit to begin with.

12:59.114 --> 13:00.741
If everyone listened to her,
there'd be no janitors...

13:00.824 --> 13:03.160
because no one would clean shit
if they had a million dollars.

13:03.244 --> 13:05.621
You know what I would do
if I had a million dollars?

13:05.704 --> 13:08.833
I would invest half of it
in glorious mutual funds...

13:08.916 --> 13:11.335
and then take the other half
to my friend Asadulah...

13:11.418 --> 13:12.503
who works in securities...

13:12.586 --> 13:14.713
Samir. Samir,
you're missing the point.

13:14.797 --> 13:16.382
The point of the exercise is
you're supposed to figure out...

13:16.465 --> 13:18.926
what you would want to do if...

13:20.052 --> 13:22.930
"PC load letter"?
What the fuck does that mean?

13:45.077 --> 13:47.872
Hey, Peter, man!
Check out channel nine!

13:47.955 --> 13:49.165
Check out this chick!

13:49.248 --> 13:51.667
Damn it! Lawrence,
can't you just pretend...

13:51.750 --> 13:53.711
like we can't hear
each other through the wall?

13:53.794 --> 13:56.046
Oh, sorry, man!
Anne over there or somethin'?

13:56.130 --> 13:57.298
No, but...

13:58.257 --> 14:00.843
If you want to talk to me,
just come over.

14:04.221 --> 14:07.266
Hey, man, check this out, dude.

14:09.602 --> 14:12.104
The key is early detection.

14:12.188 --> 14:13.272
Tumors that are detected...

14:13.355 --> 14:15.316
Aw, jeez, Lawrence.

14:15.399 --> 14:17.151
Sorry, man. I thought
you'd want to see this.

14:18.277 --> 14:19.653
Doesn't that chick
look like Anne?

14:19.737 --> 14:21.322
Yeah.

14:21.405 --> 14:22.615
A little bit. I...

14:22.698 --> 14:24.491
Hey, she hasn't been over here
in a while.

14:24.575 --> 14:25.951
You two still goin' out?

14:26.035 --> 14:27.661
Yeah.

14:27.745 --> 14:29.246
I guess. I... I don't know.

14:29.330 --> 14:31.624
Sometimes I get the feeling
like she's cheating on me.

14:31.707 --> 14:33.876
Yeah. I get that feeling,
too, man.

14:35.336 --> 14:36.795
What do you mean by that?

14:36.879 --> 14:38.422
I don't know, man.

14:39.215 --> 14:41.467
I just get that feeling
lookin' at her, like...

14:41.550 --> 14:43.886
she's the type of chick
that just...

14:44.887 --> 14:46.055
Uhh.

14:48.974 --> 14:51.143
Oh, I'm sorry, man. Look, I... I...

14:51.227 --> 14:53.270
You know,
I'm talkin' outta my ass.

14:53.354 --> 14:54.688
Forget it. Don't worry.
It's all right.

14:54.772 --> 14:56.482
Just... I had a rough day.

14:56.565 --> 14:58.192
Tell me about it, man.

14:58.275 --> 14:59.735
Ohh...

15:00.819 --> 15:02.571
Ooh, I gotta wake my ass up...

15:02.655 --> 15:05.658
at six A.M..
every day this week...

15:05.741 --> 15:07.868
drag up to Las Golindas.

15:07.952 --> 15:10.746
I'm doin' the drywall up there
at the new McDonald's.

15:11.372 --> 15:12.540
Let me ask you something.

15:13.874 --> 15:16.126
When you come in on Monday, and
you're not feelin' real well...

15:16.210 --> 15:17.336
does anyone ever say to you...

15:17.419 --> 15:19.922
"Sounds like someone
has a case of the Mondays"?

15:21.549 --> 15:22.716
No.

15:23.551 --> 15:24.969
No, man.

15:26.262 --> 15:27.638
Shit, no, man.

15:27.721 --> 15:30.307
You'd get your ass kicked,
sayin' something like that, man.

15:30.391 --> 15:31.976
Huh.

15:32.059 --> 15:33.477
We still goin' fishin'
this weekend?

15:33.561 --> 15:35.646
Ah, Lumbergh's gonna have me
come in on Saturday.

15:35.729 --> 15:36.814
I just know it.

15:36.897 --> 15:38.315
Well, you can
get out of that easily.

15:38.399 --> 15:40.442
Yeah? How?

15:40.526 --> 15:41.694
Well...

15:42.403 --> 15:44.154
when a boss wants you
to work on Saturday...

15:44.238 --> 15:47.199
he generally asks you
at the end of the day, right?

15:47.283 --> 15:48.367
Yeah.

15:48.450 --> 15:50.452
So all you gotta do is
avoid him... that's all right...

15:50.536 --> 15:52.746
I got it... on the last few hours
on Friday...

15:52.830 --> 15:54.665
duck out early...

15:54.748 --> 15:56.333
turn off
your answering machine...

15:56.417 --> 15:58.085
you should be home free, man.

16:00.546 --> 16:02.214
That's a really good idea.

16:03.090 --> 16:04.258
Fuckin' "A," man.

16:05.050 --> 16:09.847
Lawrence, what would you do
if you had a million dollars?

16:09.930 --> 16:11.849
I'll tell you what I'd do, man.

16:13.017 --> 16:15.186
Two chicks
at the same time, man.

16:19.607 --> 16:21.108
That's it?

16:21.192 --> 16:22.359
If you had a million dollars...

16:22.443 --> 16:24.486
you'd do two chicks
at the same time?

16:24.570 --> 16:27.323
Damn straight. I've always
wanted to do that, man.

16:27.406 --> 16:30.159
I think if I were a millionaire,
I could hook that up, too...

16:30.242 --> 16:31.994
'cause chicks dig dudes
with money.

16:32.077 --> 16:33.454
Well, not all chicks.

16:33.537 --> 16:36.290
The type of chicks that would
double up on a dude like me do.

16:36.373 --> 16:37.500
Good point.

16:37.583 --> 16:39.502
What about you, now?
What would you do?

16:39.585 --> 16:40.961
Besides two chicks
at the same time?

16:41.045 --> 16:42.213
Well, yeah.

16:42.296 --> 16:43.839
Nothing.

16:44.840 --> 16:45.925
Nothin', huh?

16:46.008 --> 16:48.177
I would relax.

16:48.260 --> 16:50.429
I would sit on my ass all day.

16:52.097 --> 16:53.682
I would do nothing.

16:53.766 --> 16:56.352
You don't need a million dollars
to do nothin', man.

16:56.435 --> 16:57.895
Take a look at my cousin.

16:57.978 --> 17:00.064
He's broke, don't do shit.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.861
Corporate accounts
payable. Nina speaking.

17:05.944 --> 17:07.363
Just a moment.

17:07.445 --> 17:09.865
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

17:09.949 --> 17:11.825
Just a moment.

17:11.909 --> 17:14.161
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

17:14.244 --> 17:15.829
Just a moment.

17:16.747 --> 17:18.499
So, you should ask yourself...

17:18.582 --> 17:21.126
with every decision you make...

17:21.210 --> 17:23.337
"Is this good for the company?

17:23.420 --> 17:25.047
"Am I helping with..."

17:25.130 --> 17:26.632
Is that the guy?

17:26.714 --> 17:28.843
Yeah. We're screwed.

17:28.926 --> 17:31.554
OK, then, um...

17:32.429 --> 17:35.057
I'd like to go ahead
and welcome, uh...

17:35.140 --> 17:37.476
a new member to our team here.

17:37.560 --> 17:38.894
This is, uh...

17:40.062 --> 17:41.480
Bob Slydell.

17:43.107 --> 17:45.025
Yeah. Uh...

17:45.109 --> 17:47.528
Bob is a consultant.

17:48.737 --> 17:51.198
Yeah. He's gonna be
sort of, uh...

17:52.741 --> 17:53.826
helping us out...

17:53.909 --> 17:55.327
a little here...

17:55.411 --> 17:56.829
asking some questions...

17:56.912 --> 17:58.372
maybe seeing
if there are some ways...

17:58.455 --> 18:01.167
we can make things run
a little more smoothly...

18:01.250 --> 18:02.418
around here.

18:03.502 --> 18:05.254
Yeah.

18:05.337 --> 18:07.631
Oh, and remember, next Friday...

18:07.715 --> 18:10.050
is Hawaiian shirt day.

18:11.886 --> 18:15.639
So, you know, if you want to,
go ahead and, uh...

18:15.723 --> 18:17.308
wear a Hawaiian shirt and jeans.

18:18.517 --> 18:21.187
And I said I don't care
if they lay me off, either.

18:21.270 --> 18:22.479
Because I told Bill...

18:22.563 --> 18:24.982
that if they move my desk
one more time...

18:25.065 --> 18:27.818
then I'm... I'm quitting.
I'm going to quit...

18:27.902 --> 18:29.361
and I told Dom, too...

18:29.445 --> 18:32.656
because they've moved my desk
four times already this year...

18:32.740 --> 18:34.909
and I used to be over
by the window...

18:34.992 --> 18:38.204
and I could see the squirrels,
and they were married...

18:38.287 --> 18:40.498
but then they switched
from the Swingline...

18:40.581 --> 18:43.000
to the Boston stapler, but
I kept my Swingline stapler...

18:43.083 --> 18:45.002
because it didn't
bind up as much...

18:45.085 --> 18:47.630
and I kept the staples
for the Swingline stapler.

18:47.713 --> 18:48.797
OK, Milton.

18:48.881 --> 18:50.966
No, it's not OK,
because if they make me...

18:51.050 --> 18:54.470
If they take my stapler,
then I'll... I'll... I'll...

18:54.553 --> 18:56.805
I'll set the building on fire.

18:56.889 --> 18:59.141
OK, well, that sounds great.

18:59.225 --> 19:00.976
Uh, I'll talk to you later,
all right? Bye.

19:01.060 --> 19:02.228
Peter...

19:18.202 --> 19:19.411
Good-bye.

19:41.851 --> 19:43.227
Come on.

19:45.646 --> 19:47.356
Oh, for cryin'...

20:09.128 --> 20:11.589
Hello, Peter. What's happening?

20:11.672 --> 20:13.299
Um...

20:13.382 --> 20:15.301
I'm gonna need you...

20:15.384 --> 20:17.219
to go ahead
and come in tomorrow...

20:17.303 --> 20:21.432
so if you could be here
around...

20:21.515 --> 20:23.976
nine, that would be great.

20:24.059 --> 20:25.269
OK?

20:27.021 --> 20:28.981
Oh, oh, and I almost forgot.

20:29.064 --> 20:30.816
Um...

20:30.900 --> 20:33.652
I'm also gonna need you
to go ahead and come in...

20:33.736 --> 20:36.280
on Sunday, too, OK?

20:36.363 --> 20:37.990
We, um...

20:38.073 --> 20:39.825
lost some people this week...

20:39.909 --> 20:41.994
and, uh...

20:42.077 --> 20:44.079
we need to sort of play
catch-up.

20:44.163 --> 20:45.414
Thanks.

20:49.418 --> 20:50.961
So I was sitting
in my cubicle today...

20:51.045 --> 20:55.049
and I realized, ever since
I started working, um...

20:56.342 --> 20:58.802
every single day of my life
has been worse than...

20:58.886 --> 21:00.596
the day before it.

21:01.555 --> 21:05.267
So that means that every single
day that you see me...

21:06.227 --> 21:08.103
that's on the worst day
of my life.

21:08.854 --> 21:10.314
What about today?

21:10.397 --> 21:11.649
Is today
the worst day of your life?

21:11.732 --> 21:14.360
- Yeah.
- Wow. That's messed up.

21:17.238 --> 21:18.739
I'm sorry.

21:18.822 --> 21:20.032
Go on.

21:20.115 --> 21:23.661
Is there any way
that you could sort of...

21:23.744 --> 21:26.497
just zonk me out so that, like,
I don't know...

21:26.580 --> 21:28.999
that I'm at work... in here?

21:29.083 --> 21:30.501
Could I come home...

21:30.584 --> 21:34.004
and think that I've been fishing
all day or something?

21:34.088 --> 21:36.799
That's... really not what I do,
Peter.

21:36.882 --> 21:38.133
Heh.

21:38.217 --> 21:39.385
However...

21:40.386 --> 21:42.930
the good news is,
I think I can help you.

21:43.889 --> 21:46.058
I want you to do something
for me, Peter.

21:47.726 --> 21:49.937
I want you to try and relax.

21:53.482 --> 21:56.485
I want you to relax
every muscle in your body...

21:56.569 --> 22:00.906
beginning with your toes
to your fingertips.

22:03.659 --> 22:05.828
Now I want you
to relax your legs.

22:07.204 --> 22:09.832
You're beginning to feel
your eyelids getting heavy...

22:10.958 --> 22:13.169
as you slip deeper and deeper...

22:13.252 --> 22:16.505
into a state
of complete relaxation.

22:16.589 --> 22:20.759
All your cares and concerns
are disappearing.

22:20.843 --> 22:22.344
Deeper and deeper.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.346
Way down.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.640
Your concern about your job...

22:27.433 --> 22:29.643
melts away...

22:29.727 --> 22:31.645
way...

22:31.729 --> 22:33.147
way down.

22:33.230 --> 22:34.565
Unh.

22:37.193 --> 22:39.069
Now, when I count backwards
from three...

22:39.778 --> 22:42.531
you'll be in a state
of complete relaxation.

22:42.615 --> 22:45.576
Your worries, cares,
and inhibitions will be gone...

22:46.410 --> 22:48.287
and you will remain
in that state...

22:49.497 --> 22:51.790
until I snap my fingers.

22:51.874 --> 22:53.334
Three.

22:53.417 --> 22:55.085
Deeper and deeper.

22:55.169 --> 22:56.795
Way...

22:56.879 --> 22:58.339
way down.

22:58.422 --> 23:00.424
Two.

23:00.508 --> 23:02.510
Deeper and deeper...

23:02.593 --> 23:05.429
W-w-w-way down...

23:07.473 --> 23:09.850
Whu... whu...

23:09.934 --> 23:11.143
One.

23:12.311 --> 23:15.064
Oh, my God!
Dr. Swanson!

23:16.106 --> 23:17.816
Ew... ew...

23:17.900 --> 23:19.151
- Is he breathing?
- Call 911!

23:19.235 --> 23:22.988
Oh! Where's the phone?
Where's the goddamn phone?!

23:49.056 --> 23:50.558
Ahh...

23:58.065 --> 24:00.192
Yeah, hi, it's Bill Lumbergh.

24:00.276 --> 24:01.485
It's about...

24:01.569 --> 24:03.320
ten o'clock.

24:03.404 --> 24:04.822
Yeah. Just, uh...

24:04.905 --> 24:06.282
wondering where you are.

24:08.909 --> 24:11.996
Yeah. Hi.
It's Bill Lumbergh again.

24:12.079 --> 24:12.997
Uh...

24:13.080 --> 24:14.665
I just wanted
to make sure you knew...

24:14.748 --> 24:17.209
that we did start
at the, uh...

24:17.293 --> 24:19.670
usual time this morning.

24:19.753 --> 24:22.965
Yeah. It isn't a half day
or anything like that...

24:23.048 --> 24:25.009
so if you could just go ahead...

24:25.092 --> 24:27.094
and get here
as soon as possible...

24:27.178 --> 24:29.054
that would be terrific.

24:35.519 --> 24:36.687
Ahh...

24:48.574 --> 24:50.784
Yeah. Hi. It's Bill Lum...

24:50.868 --> 24:54.121
Yeah. It's...
Yeah. Hi. It's Bill Lumber...

24:54.205 --> 24:55.998
Yeah. It's me again.

24:56.081 --> 24:58.918
Uh, I was away from my desk
for a minute.

24:59.001 --> 25:02.171
Just checking in.

25:03.380 --> 25:04.465
Hello?

25:04.548 --> 25:06.217
Peter, what's going on?

25:06.300 --> 25:07.468
Huh?

25:07.551 --> 25:09.970
It's three-thirty.
Why aren't you at work?

25:11.388 --> 25:12.973
Because I... I...

25:13.057 --> 25:14.475
I didn't feel like it.

25:15.226 --> 25:16.644
Peter, what's gotten into you?

25:16.727 --> 25:18.729
First, you just sit there
while Dr. Swanson dies...

25:18.812 --> 25:21.649
then you walk out and embarrass
me in front of my friends...

25:21.732 --> 25:23.400
and don't blame this
on hypnosis, either.

25:23.484 --> 25:25.277
That's total bull...

25:31.325 --> 25:33.452
Listen, asshole.
Nobody hangs up on me.

25:33.536 --> 25:34.995
We're through.

25:35.079 --> 25:36.997
Oh, and one more thing...

25:37.081 --> 25:39.166
I've been cheating on you!

25:44.296 --> 25:47.049
So, from now on,
only use the new time sheets...

25:47.132 --> 25:51.637
if you've worked on two or more
job codes in one day...

25:51.720 --> 25:54.682
and you need the extra columns
to fit it all in.

25:54.765 --> 25:56.058
Otherwise,
use the old time sheets...

25:56.141 --> 25:57.643
Where's Peter?

25:57.726 --> 25:59.144
I heard he didn't show up
this weekend.

25:59.228 --> 26:00.312
Uh, I don't know.

26:00.396 --> 26:01.897
...really, really help us out.

26:01.981 --> 26:03.482
Who's that guy?

26:03.566 --> 26:07.236
So, uh... any questions?

26:20.875 --> 26:22.293
Hi. I'm Peter.

26:22.376 --> 26:23.460
Hi. Can I help you?

26:23.544 --> 26:24.670
What are you doin'
for lunch today?

26:24.753 --> 26:28.299
Uh, well, our specials today
are blackened chicken.

26:28.382 --> 26:30.676
It's actually right there
on the board. Excuse me.

26:33.804 --> 26:35.139
Hey, look who's back!

26:35.222 --> 26:36.932
Table for three to...

26:39.768 --> 26:41.687
I was askin'
what you were doin' for lunch.

26:41.770 --> 26:43.397
Would you like to have lunch
with me?

26:44.982 --> 26:46.192
Are you... are you serious?

26:46.275 --> 26:47.443
Yeah.

26:48.611 --> 26:51.739
Yeah. I... I don't think
I'm supposed to do that.

26:52.364 --> 26:54.742
Oh. OK, well,
I'll tell you what I'll do.

26:54.825 --> 26:56.243
I'm gonna go next door
and get a table...

26:56.327 --> 26:57.995
and if you'd like
to join me, uh...

26:58.078 --> 26:59.330
no big deal, all right?

26:59.413 --> 27:01.290
And if not, that's cool, too.

27:01.373 --> 27:02.583
- OK?
- OK.

27:02.666 --> 27:03.792
All right.

27:04.793 --> 27:05.878
When you say,
"next door..."

27:05.961 --> 27:08.464
do you mean
Chili's or Flinger's?

27:08.547 --> 27:10.174
Flinger's.

27:10.257 --> 27:11.425
OK.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.929
What you do at Initech...

27:15.012 --> 27:17.806
is you take the specifications
from the customers...

27:17.890 --> 27:20.309
and you bring them down
to the software engineers?

27:20.392 --> 27:22.645
Yes. Y-yes.
That's... that's right.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.355
Well, then I just have to ask...

27:24.438 --> 27:25.648
why couldn't the customers...

27:25.731 --> 27:29.276
just take them directly
to the software people, huh?

27:29.360 --> 27:31.403
Well, I'll tell you why.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.323
Uh, because...

27:34.406 --> 27:37.660
engineers are not good
at dealing with customers.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.411
Uh-huh. So...

27:40.412 --> 27:45.084
you physically take the specs
from the customer?

27:46.043 --> 27:47.253
Well...

27:48.671 --> 27:51.799
no. My secretary does that
or the fax.

27:51.882 --> 27:53.592
Huh.

27:53.676 --> 27:55.386
So then you must
physically bring them...

27:55.469 --> 27:56.512
to the software people.

27:56.595 --> 27:57.721
Well...

27:59.098 --> 28:00.182
no.

28:00.266 --> 28:01.517
I mean...

28:01.600 --> 28:03.143
sometimes.

28:03.227 --> 28:07.481
What... what would you
say you do here?

28:08.566 --> 28:10.651
Well, look,
I already told you.

28:10.734 --> 28:12.987
I deal with
the goddamn customers...

28:13.070 --> 28:14.864
so the engineers don't have to.

28:14.947 --> 28:16.991
I have people skills.

28:17.074 --> 28:19.034
I am good at dealing
with people!

28:19.118 --> 28:20.494
Can't you understand that?!

28:20.578 --> 28:22.997
What the hell is wrong
with you people?!

28:23.080 --> 28:24.290
I...

28:30.921 --> 28:32.006
Let's see...

28:32.089 --> 28:34.300
you are...

28:34.383 --> 28:35.676
Michael...

28:37.094 --> 28:39.805
- Bolton?
- Yeah.

28:41.223 --> 28:42.391
Is that your real name?

28:43.142 --> 28:44.310
Yeah.

28:46.353 --> 28:48.397
Are you any relation
to the pop singer?

28:48.480 --> 28:50.482
No, it's... it's
just a coincidence.

28:50.566 --> 28:52.109
Ha ha.
To be honest with you...

28:52.193 --> 28:53.819
I love his music. I do.

28:53.903 --> 28:56.030
- I'm a Michael Bolton fan.
- Me, too.

28:56.113 --> 28:57.781
For my money, I don't
know if it gets any better...

28:57.865 --> 29:00.326
than when he sings
"When a Man Loves a Woman."

29:00.409 --> 29:02.328
But you must really
love his music, huh?

29:05.247 --> 29:06.540
Yeah, he's... he's...

29:06.624 --> 29:08.292
he's pretty...
he's pretty good, I guess.

29:08.375 --> 29:09.960
You're goddamn right, he is.

29:10.044 --> 29:12.505
Right.

29:12.588 --> 29:15.049
So tell me, what's
your favorite song of his?

29:15.966 --> 29:17.384
Mmm...

29:20.137 --> 29:22.139
I don't... I don't know.
Heh heh.

29:22.223 --> 29:24.558
I mean, I guess I sort
of like them all.

29:24.642 --> 29:27.770
That's a riot.
I'm the exact same way.

29:27.853 --> 29:29.104
But it must be twice
as hard for you...

29:29.188 --> 29:30.606
being you have
the same name as him.

29:30.689 --> 29:33.567
I celebrate
the guy's entire catalogue.

29:33.651 --> 29:36.153
Anyway, let's get down
to business, Michael.

29:36.237 --> 29:38.405
You know,
you can just call me Mike.

29:43.869 --> 29:44.954
Hi.

29:45.037 --> 29:46.330
Hey.

29:48.249 --> 29:51.126
I wonder if I'm allowed
to, uh, wear this in here?

29:51.961 --> 29:53.295
I think it would be OK.

29:54.964 --> 29:56.048
Would you like to sit down?

29:56.131 --> 29:57.383
OK.

29:58.551 --> 29:59.718
Ahh.

30:01.220 --> 30:02.304
Wow!

30:02.388 --> 30:05.140
This place is really... nice.

30:05.224 --> 30:07.518
Yeah. Is it?

30:07.601 --> 30:09.812
Yeah, my God,
compared to Chotchkie's!

30:09.895 --> 30:12.231
I like the uniforms better,
anyways.

30:13.065 --> 30:14.149
I like yours.

30:14.233 --> 30:15.401
Ugh!

30:18.654 --> 30:20.239
"We're not in Kansas anymore."

30:20.322 --> 30:22.366
Yeah.

30:22.449 --> 30:24.827
Really. Ha ha.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.328
It's on your...

30:27.663 --> 30:29.832
Ohh! Yeah. That's...

30:29.915 --> 30:31.792
That's, uh...

30:31.876 --> 30:34.837
That's one of my...
my pieces of flair.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.005
What's a "piece of flair"?

30:36.088 --> 30:38.090
Oh, it's, uh, where, you know...

30:38.174 --> 30:41.719
like these suspenders and, uh,
buttons, they're all sort of...

30:41.802 --> 30:43.846
We're actually required
to wear...

30:43.929 --> 30:46.891
um, fifteen pieces of flair.

30:46.974 --> 30:49.143
It's really stupid, actually.

30:49.226 --> 30:50.436
Do you get to pick 'em
yourself?

30:50.519 --> 30:51.979
Yeah, yeah, we do.

30:52.062 --> 30:53.189
Although I didn't actually
choose these.

30:53.272 --> 30:57.568
I just sort of grabbed,
you know, fifteen buttons.

30:57.651 --> 31:00.404
I don't even know what they say.
I don't really care.

31:01.071 --> 31:02.698
I don't really like
talking about my flair.

31:02.781 --> 31:04.158
OK.

31:04.241 --> 31:07.244
So, where do you, work, Peter?

31:07.328 --> 31:08.829
Initech.

31:08.913 --> 31:10.706
And... Yeah?
What... what do you do there?

31:11.790 --> 31:13.459
I sit in a cubicle...

31:13.542 --> 31:16.545
and I update bank software
for the 2000 switch.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.089
What's that?

31:19.173 --> 31:21.300
Well, see, they wrote
all this bank software...

31:21.383 --> 31:23.302
and, uh, to save space...

31:23.385 --> 31:25.137
they used two digits
for the date instead of four.

31:25.221 --> 31:28.140
So like 98 instead of 1998.

31:28.224 --> 31:31.435
Uh, so I go through these
thousands of lines of code...

31:31.519 --> 31:34.313
and, uh...
It doesn't really matter.

31:34.396 --> 31:37.274
I, uh, I don't like my job,
and, uh...

31:37.358 --> 31:39.652
I don't think I'm gonna go
anymore.

31:40.903 --> 31:42.154
You're just not gonna go?

31:42.238 --> 31:43.405
Yeah.

31:43.489 --> 31:44.657
Won't you get fired?

31:45.574 --> 31:46.784
I don't know.

31:46.867 --> 31:50.663
But I really don't like it,
and, uh, I'm not gonna go.

31:51.831 --> 31:52.832
So you're gonna quit?

31:52.915 --> 31:56.085
Nah-uh. Not really. Uh...

31:56.168 --> 31:57.753
I'm just gonna stop going.

32:00.047 --> 32:01.131
What?

32:01.215 --> 32:03.300
Uh, when did you decide
all that?

32:03.384 --> 32:04.468
About an hour ago.

32:04.552 --> 32:05.970
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

32:06.053 --> 32:07.221
An hour ago.

32:08.556 --> 32:10.099
So you're gonna get another job?

32:10.182 --> 32:12.309
I don't think I'd like
another job.

32:12.393 --> 32:16.230
Well, what are you going to do
about money and bills and...

32:16.313 --> 32:18.816
You know, I've never
really liked paying bills.

32:18.899 --> 32:20.401
I don't think
I'm gonna do that, either.

32:22.444 --> 32:23.571
Ahh...

32:23.654 --> 32:25.739
well, so what do you want to do?

32:25.823 --> 32:27.783
I want to take you
out to dinner...

32:27.867 --> 32:30.161
and then I want to go back to my
apartment and watch "Kung Fu."

32:30.244 --> 32:31.579
Do you ever watch "Kung Fu"?

32:33.706 --> 32:35.374
I love "Kung Fu."

32:35.457 --> 32:37.710
- Channel 39.
- Totally.

32:37.793 --> 32:39.545
You should come over
and watch "Kung Fu" tonight.

32:39.628 --> 32:41.589
- OK.
- Great.

32:41.672 --> 32:43.799
OK. Can we order lunch first?

32:43.883 --> 32:45.426
- Yeah.
- OK.

33:00.900 --> 33:03.194
Took a stapler off my desk...

33:09.783 --> 33:12.495
Anyway, sounds great, Bob.
See you in a few.

33:15.164 --> 33:17.625
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

33:17.708 --> 33:19.293
Nothing.

33:19.376 --> 33:21.295
I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead...

33:21.378 --> 33:23.631
and move your desk
again, so...

33:23.714 --> 33:26.467
if you could go ahead
and get it as far back...

33:26.550 --> 33:28.385
against that wall as possible...

33:28.469 --> 33:29.720
that would be great.

33:29.803 --> 33:31.305
No, because I was...

33:31.388 --> 33:32.848
That way,
we'll have some room...

33:32.932 --> 33:34.725
for some of these boxes
and things...

33:34.808 --> 33:37.937
we need to put in here,
and, uh...

33:38.020 --> 33:41.440
Oh. Oh, there it is.

33:41.524 --> 33:44.193
Here, let me just go ahead
and get that from you.

33:46.362 --> 33:47.655
Great.

33:48.823 --> 33:52.076
So if you could just get to that
as soon as possible...

33:52.159 --> 33:54.870
that would be terrific, OK?

33:54.954 --> 33:57.623
Thanks a bunch, Milton.
Good-bye.

33:57.706 --> 34:00.042
OK.

34:01.043 --> 34:03.420
I could set the building
on fire.

34:06.715 --> 34:08.717
- Peter.
- Michael.

34:08.801 --> 34:09.885
What the hell's going on, man?

34:09.969 --> 34:11.804
I thought you'd come in here
and start shooting.

34:11.887 --> 34:13.931
No. I just came to get
my address book.

34:14.014 --> 34:15.139
I'm not gonna stay.

34:15.224 --> 34:17.518
I got a phone number,
Mike, that I don't wanna lose.

34:17.601 --> 34:19.311
What?
Peter, you're in deep shit.

34:19.395 --> 34:21.397
You were supposed to come in
Saturday. What were you doing?

34:22.273 --> 34:25.109
Michael, I did nothing.

34:25.192 --> 34:26.652
I did absolutely nothing...

34:26.735 --> 34:29.655
and it was everything
that I thought it could be.

34:29.737 --> 34:32.324
I hope you have
a better story for Lumbergh.

34:32.408 --> 34:34.994
You're supposed to be at your
interview with the consultants.

34:35.077 --> 34:36.203
The who?

34:36.286 --> 34:38.581
The consultants.
What has gotten into you?

34:40.541 --> 34:43.835
Oh, yeah... right.

34:44.753 --> 34:47.590
Wait, Peter.
You gotta postpone it, man.

34:47.672 --> 34:48.757
Tell 'em you've been sick.
Make something up.

34:48.841 --> 34:50.967
Oh, no way. No, I feel great.

34:51.051 --> 34:52.887
It's the best day of my life.

34:55.139 --> 34:57.474
Next batter
looks like a Peter Gibbons.

34:57.558 --> 34:58.684
Uh-huh.

34:58.767 --> 35:01.061
Ah, there you are.
We were just talking about you.

35:01.145 --> 35:02.771
You must be Peter Gibbons.

35:02.855 --> 35:04.190
Uh-huh. Terrific.

35:04.273 --> 35:06.650
I'm Bob Slydell. This is
my associate Bob Porter.

35:06.734 --> 35:08.152
Oh, hi, Bob. Bob.

35:08.235 --> 35:10.779
Grab a seat
and join us for a minute or two.

35:12.323 --> 35:14.033
You see, what we're
actually trying to do here...

35:14.116 --> 35:17.036
is we're just,
we're trying to get a feel...

35:17.119 --> 35:18.996
for how people spend their day
at work.

35:19.079 --> 35:20.706
So if you would...

35:20.789 --> 35:24.376
would you walk us through
a typical day for you?

35:25.544 --> 35:27.796
- Yeah.
- Great.

35:27.880 --> 35:31.342
Well, I generally come in
at least fifteen minutes late.

35:31.425 --> 35:33.844
Uh, I use the side door.

35:33.928 --> 35:36.889
That way Lumbergh can't see me.

35:36.972 --> 35:40.893
And after that, I just sort of
space out for about an hour.

35:40.976 --> 35:43.479
Uh, "space out"?

35:43.562 --> 35:44.647
Yeah.

35:44.730 --> 35:46.565
I just stare at my desk.

35:46.649 --> 35:48.108
But it looks like I'm working.

35:48.192 --> 35:51.987
I do that for probably
another hour after lunch, too.

35:52.071 --> 35:53.864
I'd say in a given week...

35:53.948 --> 35:55.783
I probably only do
about fifteen minutes...

35:55.866 --> 35:58.744
of real, actual work.

36:00.246 --> 36:03.457
Peter,
would you be a good sport...

36:03.541 --> 36:05.501
and indulge us and just...

36:05.584 --> 36:06.627
tell us a little more?

36:06.710 --> 36:08.170
Oh, yeah.

36:08.254 --> 36:11.924
Let me tell you something
about T.P.S. reports.

36:12.007 --> 36:13.133
Ahh...

36:13.217 --> 36:16.595
The thing is, Bob,
it's not that I'm lazy.

36:16.679 --> 36:18.639
It's that I just don't care.

36:18.722 --> 36:20.891
Don't... don't care?

36:20.975 --> 36:23.477
It's a problem of motivation,
all right?

36:23.561 --> 36:25.145
Now, if I work my ass off...

36:25.229 --> 36:27.106
and Initech
ships a few extra units...

36:27.189 --> 36:28.983
I don't see another dime.

36:29.066 --> 36:30.693
So where's the motivation?

36:31.443 --> 36:33.320
And here's something else,
Bob...

36:33.404 --> 36:35.322
I have eight different bosses
right now.

36:35.406 --> 36:36.490
- I beg your pardon?
- Eight bosses.

36:36.574 --> 36:37.658
- Eight?
- Eight, Bob.

36:37.741 --> 36:40.494
So that means that
when I make a mistake...

36:40.578 --> 36:44.123
I have eight different people
coming by to tell me about it.

36:44.206 --> 36:47.501
That's my only real motivation,
is not to be hassled.

36:47.585 --> 36:48.794
That and the fear
of losing my job.

36:48.878 --> 36:50.713
But you know, Bob...

36:50.796 --> 36:52.464
that'll only make someone
work just hard enough...

36:52.548 --> 36:53.716
not to get fired.

36:54.383 --> 36:57.303
Would you bear with me
for just a second, please?

36:57.386 --> 36:58.721
OK.

36:59.972 --> 37:01.724
What if...
and believe me...

37:01.807 --> 37:04.768
this is strictly hypothetical...

37:04.852 --> 37:08.856
but what if you were offered
some kind of a stock option...

37:08.939 --> 37:10.649
equity-sharing program?

37:10.733 --> 37:11.984
Would that do anything for you?

37:12.067 --> 37:14.278
I don't know. I guess.
Listen, I'm gonna go.

37:14.361 --> 37:17.323
Uh, it's been really nice
talking to both of you guys.

37:17.406 --> 37:18.657
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

37:18.741 --> 37:21.327
Pleasure's all on this
side of the table, trust me.

37:21.410 --> 37:22.953
Good luck
with your layoffs, all right?

37:23.037 --> 37:24.788
I hope your firings
go really well.

37:24.872 --> 37:25.998
- OK.
- Thanks a lot.

37:26.081 --> 37:27.833
Great. Wow.

37:35.466 --> 37:37.801
So, Peter, what's happening?

37:37.885 --> 37:39.261
Listen, uh...

37:46.644 --> 37:48.979
Joanna, would you
come here a minute, please?

37:49.063 --> 37:50.940
Yeah.

37:51.023 --> 37:55.194
I'm sorry I was late, but I
was having lunch, and I, uh...

37:55.277 --> 37:56.904
We need to talk about
your flair.

37:57.780 --> 38:00.658
Really?
I... I have fifteen pieces on.

38:00.741 --> 38:02.201
I also...

38:02.284 --> 38:05.412
Well, fifteen
is the minimum, OK?

38:05.496 --> 38:06.580
Oh. OK.

38:06.664 --> 38:08.582
Now, you know,
it's up to you whether or not...

38:08.666 --> 38:11.502
you want to just
do the bare minimum or...

38:11.585 --> 38:12.795
Well, like Brian, for example...

38:12.878 --> 38:16.257
has thirty-seven pieces of flair
on today.

38:16.340 --> 38:17.633
And a terrific smile.

38:17.716 --> 38:20.052
OK, so you want me to wear more?

38:21.679 --> 38:22.763
Look, Joanna...

38:22.847 --> 38:23.931
Yeah?

38:24.014 --> 38:25.850
People can get
a cheeseburger anywhere, OK?

38:25.933 --> 38:29.061
They come to Chotchkie's for
the atmosphere and the attitude.

38:29.854 --> 38:31.146
OK? that's what
the flair's about.

38:31.230 --> 38:32.898
- It's about fun.
- Yeah.

38:32.982 --> 38:35.151
OK, so more then, yeah?

38:36.902 --> 38:40.114
Look, we want you
to express yourself, OK?

38:40.197 --> 38:44.618
Now if you feel that the bare
minimum is enough, then, OK...

38:44.702 --> 38:47.454
but some people choose
to wear more...

38:47.538 --> 38:49.415
and we encourage that, OK?

38:50.749 --> 38:52.751
You do want to express yourself,
don't you?

38:53.878 --> 38:54.962
Y-yeah.

38:55.045 --> 38:57.464
OK, great, great.
That's all I ask.

38:57.548 --> 38:59.175
OK.

39:00.301 --> 39:03.012
Right, so there's
three more people...

39:03.095 --> 39:05.097
we can easily lose.

39:05.181 --> 39:08.392
Then there's Tom Smykowski.

39:09.310 --> 39:10.394
He's useless.

39:10.477 --> 39:12.021
Gone.

39:12.104 --> 39:13.689
Sounds good to me.

39:13.772 --> 39:16.150
Here's a peculiar...

39:16.233 --> 39:18.486
- Uh, Milton Waddams.
- Who's he?

39:18.569 --> 39:20.571
You know, squirrelly
looking guy. Mumbles a lot.

39:20.654 --> 39:21.739
Oh, yeah.

39:21.822 --> 39:23.491
We... we can't actually
find a record...

39:23.574 --> 39:25.826
of him being
a current employee here.

39:25.910 --> 39:27.703
I looked into it
more deeply...

39:27.786 --> 39:29.705
and I found that
apparently what happened...

39:29.788 --> 39:32.500
is that he was laid off
five years ago...

39:32.583 --> 39:33.751
and no one ever
told him about it...

39:33.834 --> 39:36.295
but through some kind of glitch
in the payroll department...

39:36.378 --> 39:37.671
he still gets a paycheque.

39:37.755 --> 39:40.591
So we just went ahead
and fixed the glitch.

39:40.674 --> 39:41.759
Great.

39:41.842 --> 39:44.512
So, uh, Milton has been let go?

39:44.595 --> 39:45.679
Just a second there,
professor.

39:45.763 --> 39:49.308
We, uh, we fixed the glitch.

39:49.391 --> 39:51.519
So he won't be receiving
a paycheque anymore.

39:51.602 --> 39:54.063
So it'll just work itself out
naturally.

39:54.146 --> 39:57.191
We always like to avoid
confrontation whenever possible.

39:57.274 --> 39:58.359
The problem is solved
from your end.

39:59.610 --> 40:03.072
I'd like to move us
right along to a Peter Gibbons.

40:03.155 --> 40:05.699
Now, we had a chance
to meet this young man...

40:05.783 --> 40:08.369
and, boy, that's just
a straight shooter...

40:08.452 --> 40:10.120
with upper management
written all over him.

40:10.204 --> 40:12.581
Eech. Ooh.

40:12.665 --> 40:15.960
Yeah. Um...

40:16.043 --> 40:17.294
I'm going to have to go ahead...

40:17.378 --> 40:19.505
and sort of disagree
with you there.

40:19.588 --> 40:22.132
Yeah, uh, he's been
real flaky lately...

40:22.216 --> 40:25.970
and I'm just not sure
that he's the caliber person...

40:26.053 --> 40:28.305
that we would want
for upper management.

40:28.389 --> 40:31.058
He's also been having
some problems...

40:31.141 --> 40:33.060
with his T.P.S. reports.

40:34.144 --> 40:36.021
I'll handle this.

40:36.105 --> 40:39.149
We feel...

40:39.233 --> 40:41.318
that the problem
isn't with Peter.

40:41.402 --> 40:43.154
Mm-mmm.

40:43.237 --> 40:45.322
It's that you haven't
challenged him enough...

40:45.406 --> 40:46.490
to get him really motivated.

40:46.574 --> 40:47.741
There it is.

40:49.160 --> 40:51.620
Yeah... Ah, well...

40:51.704 --> 40:53.956
I'm just not sure about that
right now.

40:54.039 --> 40:56.750
Yeah, Bill, let me ask
you a real quick question here.

40:56.834 --> 41:00.129
How much time would you say
you spend each week...

41:00.212 --> 41:02.214
dealing with
these T.P.S. reports?

41:07.428 --> 41:08.596
Yeah...

42:16.038 --> 42:17.248
Hey, Peter, man!

42:17.331 --> 42:20.876
Check out channel nine.
It's the breast exams. Whoo!

42:36.725 --> 42:37.977
Hi, Peter.

42:38.060 --> 42:39.812
Oh, hi, Dom.

43:28.235 --> 43:30.112
So... Peter...

43:30.196 --> 43:31.280
what's happening?

43:31.363 --> 43:34.658
Ahh, now,
are you going to go ahead...

43:34.742 --> 43:38.579
and have those T.P.S. reports
for us this afternoon?

43:38.662 --> 43:40.039
No.

43:41.290 --> 43:43.792
Ahh... yeah...

43:43.876 --> 43:45.753
So I guess we should
probably go ahead...

43:45.836 --> 43:48.714
and have a little talk, hmm?

43:48.797 --> 43:51.800
Not right now, Lumbergh,
I'm... I'm kinda busy.

43:51.884 --> 43:55.721
In fact, I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead.

43:56.597 --> 43:57.806
Just come back another time.

43:57.890 --> 44:00.309
I got a meeting with the Bobs
in a couple of minutes.

44:01.393 --> 44:03.521
Uh, I wasn't aware
of a meeting with them.

44:03.604 --> 44:05.814
Yeah, they called me at home.

44:10.611 --> 44:11.695
That sounds good, Peter.

44:11.779 --> 44:13.948
And, uh, we'll go ahead and...

44:14.031 --> 44:16.325
get this all fixed up for you.

44:16.408 --> 44:17.451
Great.

44:22.456 --> 44:25.167
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

44:26.460 --> 44:28.796
I... I didn't receive
my paycheque this week.

44:28.879 --> 44:33.467
Uh, you're going to have to talk
to payroll about that.

44:33.551 --> 44:34.802
I did and they said...

44:34.885 --> 44:36.679
Milt, we're gonna go ahead...

44:36.762 --> 44:40.474
and move you downstairs
into storage "B."

44:40.558 --> 44:42.268
No, I... I...

44:42.351 --> 44:46.313
New people are coming,
and we need the space.

44:46.397 --> 44:47.648
But there's no space...

44:47.731 --> 44:51.318
So if you could go ahead
and pack your stuff...

44:51.402 --> 44:53.070
and move it down there...

44:53.154 --> 44:55.156
that would be terrific.

44:55.239 --> 44:56.532
OK?

44:56.615 --> 44:58.617
Uh, excuse me...

44:58.701 --> 45:04.290
I believe you have my stapler,
please. Hmm.

45:04.415 --> 45:06.667
You've been missing
a lot of work lately.

45:06.750 --> 45:08.919
I wouldn't say
I've been missing it, Bob.

45:10.337 --> 45:11.589
Good one.

45:11.672 --> 45:13.465
Oh, that's terrific, Peter.

45:13.549 --> 45:16.677
I'm sure you've... you've heard
some of the rumors...

45:16.760 --> 45:18.470
circulating
around the hallways...

45:18.554 --> 45:21.307
about how we're going to do
a little "housecleaning..."

45:21.390 --> 45:22.641
with some software people.

45:22.725 --> 45:25.895
Well, Bob, I have heard that.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

45:25.978 --> 45:27.980
We'll be getting rid
of these people.

45:28.063 --> 45:32.860
First, Mr. Samir Naga...

45:32.943 --> 45:34.111
Naga...

45:34.195 --> 45:37.406
Naga-gonna work here
anymore, anyway.

45:37.490 --> 45:40.868
And Mr. Mike Bolton.
Nobody's gonna miss him.

45:40.951 --> 45:42.620
You're gonna layoff
Samir and Michael?

45:42.703 --> 45:45.206
Yeah. We're gonna bring
in some entry-level graduates.

45:45.289 --> 45:47.458
Farm some work out to Singapore,
that's the usual deal.

45:47.541 --> 45:48.792
It's standard
operating procedure.

45:48.876 --> 45:51.045
Do they know this yet?

45:51.128 --> 45:53.297
No. No, of course not.

45:53.380 --> 45:56.175
We find it's always better
to fire people on a Friday.

45:56.258 --> 45:58.469
Studies have
statistically shown...

45:58.552 --> 46:00.221
there's less chance
of an incident...

46:00.304 --> 46:01.972
if you do it at the end
of the week.

46:02.056 --> 46:05.142
Peter, what we'd like to do
is put you into position...

46:05.226 --> 46:08.896
to have as many
as four people...

46:08.979 --> 46:10.272
working right underneath you.

46:10.356 --> 46:12.483
This is a big promotion, Pete.

46:12.566 --> 46:15.194
So you're going
to fire Michael and Samir...

46:15.277 --> 46:17.112
and give me more money?

46:19.073 --> 46:20.783
Uh-huh.

46:20.866 --> 46:23.035
Wow!

46:23.118 --> 46:26.080
Hmm. Yeah.

46:26.163 --> 46:28.958
That's it.
That's exactly what I need.

46:29.041 --> 46:30.292
Give it to me.

46:30.376 --> 46:31.836
Come on, you little fucker,
let's go.

46:31.919 --> 46:33.462
That's what I need.
Let's do that.

46:33.546 --> 46:36.090
Let's do exactly that,
you little fuck...

46:36.173 --> 46:37.967
- Michael.
- Hey.

46:38.050 --> 46:39.426
Listen to me.

46:41.971 --> 46:43.556
What are you doing tonight?

46:45.099 --> 46:47.977
Michael, there comes
a point in a man's life...

46:48.060 --> 46:50.563
and maybe that time for you
is now...

46:51.689 --> 46:55.317
when it doesn't hurt to start
thinking about the future.

46:55.401 --> 46:57.486
Uh, no offence there, Peter...

46:57.570 --> 46:59.321
but speak for yourself there,
sport.

46:59.405 --> 47:02.575
I'm not the one who's been
flakin' out at work.

47:02.658 --> 47:06.662
I know you had this religious
experience or whatever...

47:06.745 --> 47:09.498
but get your shit together,
or you're gonna get canned.

47:10.499 --> 47:13.002
Yeah, and, uh, and I... Listen...

47:14.044 --> 47:15.796
That virus
you're always talking about...

47:15.880 --> 47:18.007
the one that could
rip off the company...

47:18.090 --> 47:19.508
for a bunch of money.

47:19.592 --> 47:20.843
Yeah, what about it?

47:20.926 --> 47:22.595
Well, how does it work?

47:23.387 --> 47:24.763
It's pretty brilliant.

47:24.847 --> 47:26.974
What it does is every time
there's a bank transaction...

47:27.057 --> 47:29.476
where interest is computed...
there are thousands a day...

47:29.560 --> 47:31.520
the computer ends up with
these fractions of a cent...

47:31.604 --> 47:33.105
which it usually rounds off.

47:33.189 --> 47:35.524
What this does is it takes
those little remainders...

47:35.608 --> 47:37.526
and puts it into an account.

47:37.610 --> 47:40.321
- This sounds familiar.
- They did it in "Superman III."

47:40.404 --> 47:41.530
Right, uh...

47:41.614 --> 47:43.324
An underrated movie, actually.

47:43.407 --> 47:46.702
There were hackers that did it
in the seventies as well.

47:46.785 --> 47:49.788
- So they check for this now.
- No, here's the thing.

47:49.872 --> 47:53.125
Initech's so backed up with all
the software we're updating...

47:53.209 --> 47:54.335
they'd never notice.

47:54.418 --> 47:56.420
You're right.

47:56.504 --> 47:58.839
Even if they wanted to, they
couldn't check all that code.

47:58.923 --> 48:01.926
Thumbs up their asses.
Thumbs up their asses.

48:02.009 --> 48:05.930
So, Michael, what's
to stop you from doing this?

48:06.013 --> 48:08.557
It's not worth the risk.
I got a good job.

48:09.767 --> 48:12.228
What if you didn't have
a good job?

48:13.687 --> 48:14.897
Cock gobblers!

48:18.567 --> 48:22.321
Samir and I are
the best programmers they got.

48:22.404 --> 48:24.573
You haven't been showin' up,
and you get to keep your job.

48:24.657 --> 48:26.450
Actually, I'm being promoted.

48:26.534 --> 48:29.161
- What?!
- I know, Michael.

48:29.245 --> 48:31.747
It's completely unfair.

48:31.831 --> 48:34.291
And I realized something today.

48:34.375 --> 48:37.294
It's not just about me
and my dream of doing nothing.

48:37.378 --> 48:39.380
It's about all of us together.

48:41.048 --> 48:44.385
I don't know what happened to me
at that hypnotherapist.

48:44.468 --> 48:46.971
Maybe it was just shock,
and it's wearing off now...

48:47.054 --> 48:49.723
but when I saw that fat man
keel over and die...

48:49.807 --> 48:52.768
Michael, we don't have
a lot of time on this earth.

48:52.852 --> 48:55.771
We weren't meant to spend it
this way.

48:55.855 --> 48:59.150
Human beings were not meant
to sit in little cubicles...

48:59.233 --> 49:01.152
staring at computer screens
all day...

49:01.235 --> 49:02.319
filling out useless forms...

49:02.403 --> 49:04.029
and listening
to eight different bosses...

49:04.113 --> 49:06.532
drone on
about mission statements.

49:06.615 --> 49:09.493
I told those fudgepackers
I liked Michael Bolton's music.

49:09.577 --> 49:13.247
Ohh. That is not right, Michael.

49:13.330 --> 49:16.167
For five years now,
you've worked your ass off...

49:16.250 --> 49:20.296
hoping for a promotion,
profit sharing, or something.

49:20.379 --> 49:21.755
Five years...

49:21.839 --> 49:24.633
of your mid-twenties now gone.

49:24.717 --> 49:25.968
And you're gonna
go in tomorrow...

49:26.051 --> 49:28.637
they're gonna throw you
out on the street.

49:28.721 --> 49:30.472
You know why?

49:30.556 --> 49:34.977
So Bill Lumbergh's stock
will go up a quarter of a point.

49:35.060 --> 49:36.645
Ugh.

49:36.729 --> 49:38.814
Michael, let's make
that stock go down...

49:38.898 --> 49:40.858
and let's take enough money
out of that place...

49:40.941 --> 49:44.236
so that we never have
to sit in a cubicle ever again.

49:45.696 --> 49:47.615
Your software works, right?

49:47.698 --> 49:49.366
Of course it works.
That's not the point.

49:50.826 --> 49:52.912
Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't
know how to install it.

49:52.995 --> 49:55.498
I don't know the credit union's
software well enough. OK?

49:55.581 --> 49:58.542
Yeah. But Samir does.

49:59.376 --> 50:00.836
But that's not much money.

50:00.920 --> 50:02.129
That's the beauty of it.

50:02.213 --> 50:06.258
Each withdrawal, it's a fraction
of a cent, too small to notice.

50:06.342 --> 50:08.511
But you take a few thousand
withdrawals a day...

50:08.594 --> 50:10.012
you space it out
over a couple of years...

50:10.095 --> 50:12.348
that's a few
hundred thousand dollars.

50:12.431 --> 50:13.641
It's like "Superman III."

50:13.724 --> 50:15.768
"Superman III"?

50:15.851 --> 50:19.522
I have to leave now.
I have to get my résumé ready.

50:19.605 --> 50:23.776
For another job where
they can fire you for no reason?

50:23.859 --> 50:26.570
That's right. If I'm lucky.

50:26.654 --> 50:30.783
I'm tired of being
pushed around. Aren't you?

50:30.866 --> 50:33.619
Yes, but I'm not going to do
anything illegal.

50:33.702 --> 50:36.121
Illegal?
Samir, this is America.

50:36.205 --> 50:38.249
Come on. Sit down.

50:39.208 --> 50:41.418
Come on. This isn't Riyadh.

50:41.502 --> 50:44.421
They're not going
to saw your hands off here.

50:44.505 --> 50:46.882
The worst they'd do is put you
for a couple of months...

50:46.966 --> 50:50.261
into a white-collar,
minimum-security resort.

50:50.344 --> 50:54.014
Shit, we should be so lucky.
They have conjugal visits there.

50:54.098 --> 50:55.724
- Really?
- Yes.

50:55.808 --> 50:57.101
Shit!

50:57.184 --> 50:59.937
I'm a free man. I haven't had
a conjugal visit in six months.

51:00.020 --> 51:01.772
So what do you think?

51:01.856 --> 51:04.358
This thing is actually
pretty fail-safe, Samir.

51:04.441 --> 51:05.651
Samir?

51:07.361 --> 51:10.114
You came here looking
for a land of opportunity.

51:10.197 --> 51:13.325
And this is the knock
of that opportunity.

51:13.409 --> 51:15.786
Tomorrow is your last day
at Initech.

51:15.870 --> 51:17.371
You have two options...

51:17.454 --> 51:19.832
unemployment
or early retirement.

51:19.915 --> 51:21.500
What's it gonna be?

51:22.293 --> 51:23.878
- I have a question.
- Yes?

51:23.961 --> 51:27.673
In this conjugal visits,
you can have sex with women?

51:27.756 --> 51:30.467
Yep, you sure can.

51:33.971 --> 51:35.139
OK, I'll do it.

51:35.222 --> 51:38.100
That's what I'm talkin'
about when I talk about America!

51:38.184 --> 51:39.560
Can we discuss the plan?

51:39.643 --> 51:41.312
OK, yeah, good, right.

51:41.395 --> 51:42.855
It works like a computer virus.

51:42.938 --> 51:45.524
All we do is load it into
the credit union's mainframe.

51:45.608 --> 51:46.775
It'll do the rest.

51:46.859 --> 51:49.195
Get me that disk,
and I'll take it from there.

51:49.278 --> 51:52.114
Before we go any further,
all right?

51:52.198 --> 51:54.700
We have to swear to God,
Allah...

51:54.783 --> 51:57.286
that nobody knows about this
but us, all right?

51:57.369 --> 52:00.456
No family members,
no girlfriends. Nobody.

52:00.539 --> 52:01.749
- Of course.
- Agreed.

52:01.832 --> 52:04.001
Don't worry, man!
I won't tell anyone, either.

52:04.084 --> 52:06.295
- What the fuck is that?
- Don't worry. He's cool.

52:06.378 --> 52:09.757
All right. Here's how
I see it all going down.

52:09.840 --> 52:12.635
Peter, congratulations.
This is one heck of a promotion.

52:12.718 --> 52:13.928
Thank you, Bob.

52:14.011 --> 52:16.305
We'll get some people
under you right away.

53:42.016 --> 53:43.267
That was easy.

53:43.350 --> 53:45.352
Yeah, I guess it was.

53:45.436 --> 53:47.021
What'd you do with the...

53:47.188 --> 53:48.981
Hey, man.

53:49.064 --> 53:50.733
Oh, hey, Drew.

53:50.816 --> 53:52.443
You guys hear
about Tom Smykowski?

53:52.526 --> 53:53.611
That he got laid off?

53:53.694 --> 53:55.196
No, man, check it out.

53:55.279 --> 53:57.823
Last week, after he found out
he was getting laid off...

53:57.907 --> 54:01.285
he tries to kill himself by
running the car in the garage.

54:01.368 --> 54:02.495
Is he dead?

54:02.578 --> 54:04.121
No, man, check it out.

54:04.205 --> 54:07.333
His wife comes home early
and catches him.

54:07.416 --> 54:09.293
He tries to play it off
like nothing happened.

54:09.376 --> 54:12.296
I was having some trouble
with the shifter here.

54:12.379 --> 54:13.672
It's jammed.

54:13.756 --> 54:16.217
I... I couldn't get it
into drive.

54:16.300 --> 54:18.969
- I... I... I mean, reverse.
- You OK, Tom?

54:19.053 --> 54:21.347
Then as he's lookin' at her...

54:21.430 --> 54:23.432
he decides he wants to live.

54:23.516 --> 54:24.975
Yeah, I think I'm OK.

54:25.059 --> 54:26.435
Right.

54:26.519 --> 54:28.687
Seems to be working now.

54:30.481 --> 54:32.191
See you later, honey.

54:32.274 --> 54:33.526
Love ya.

54:35.110 --> 54:38.989
But as soon as he backs
out of his driveway... Bam!

54:39.073 --> 54:41.700
He gets slammed big-time
by a drunk driver.

54:41.784 --> 54:43.744
- Is he OK?
- Sort of.

54:43.828 --> 54:46.956
Broke both his wrists, legs,
a couple of ribs, his back...

54:47.039 --> 54:49.208
but he's getting
a huge settlement out of this.

54:49.291 --> 54:50.459
Like seven figures.

54:50.543 --> 54:52.044
He's getting out
of the hospital tomorrow.

54:52.127 --> 54:54.046
He's throwing a big party
this weekend to celebrate.

54:54.129 --> 54:56.131
We're all invited.

54:56.215 --> 54:58.843
I'm thinking I might take
that new chick from logistics.

54:58.926 --> 55:01.470
Things go well, I might be
showing her my "Oh" face.

55:01.554 --> 55:03.931
Oh, oh, oh...

55:04.014 --> 55:07.059
You know what I'm talking about.
Oh.

55:07.142 --> 55:09.270
Yeah. Right.

55:09.353 --> 55:10.688
See you guys there.

55:12.022 --> 55:15.234
Wow, our last day at Initech.

55:16.527 --> 55:18.529
I can't believe
they had security escort us out.

55:18.612 --> 55:20.865
It's not like
we're going to steal something.

55:23.117 --> 55:24.243
I stole something.

55:24.326 --> 55:26.328
Oh, yeah. I guess we all did.

55:26.412 --> 55:29.081
No, I stole something else.

55:30.124 --> 55:31.584
What did you steal?

55:33.169 --> 55:35.462
Call it a going-away present.

57:12.685 --> 57:14.145
Who's got my keys?

57:14.228 --> 57:15.604
I'm driving.

57:15.688 --> 57:17.356
Everything is gonna be OK.

57:17.439 --> 57:19.275
All right? OK?

57:19.358 --> 57:20.943
It's fun, and it's exciting.

57:21.026 --> 57:23.571
I gotta... I gotta go. All right?

57:23.654 --> 57:24.822
Joanna's coming over.

57:24.905 --> 57:28.075
Don't worry.
You're worrying. All right?

57:28.159 --> 57:30.286
Monday morning, we're gonna
check the account balance.

57:30.369 --> 57:31.453
Everything will be OK.

57:31.537 --> 57:33.664
Don't miss Tom's barbecue.
I'll see you there.

57:33.747 --> 57:35.457
All right? Good night!

57:35.541 --> 57:38.210
Back up in your ass
with the resurrection

57:40.796 --> 57:42.923
What were you guys
celebrating last night?

57:43.007 --> 57:47.720
Oh, um... I'm not really
at liberty to talk about it.

57:50.931 --> 57:52.558
I really can't.

57:55.269 --> 57:58.314
So, when the subroutine
compounds the interest...

57:58.397 --> 58:00.608
it uses all these
extra decimal places...

58:00.691 --> 58:02.568
that just get rounded off.

58:02.651 --> 58:04.195
So we simplified
the whole thing...

58:04.278 --> 58:07.531
and we round 'em all down
and drop the remainder...

58:07.615 --> 58:09.617
into an account that we opened.

58:10.743 --> 58:12.161
So you're stealing?

58:13.204 --> 58:15.039
Uh, no.
No, you don't understand.

58:15.122 --> 58:18.876
It's, uh, very complicated.
It's, uh...

58:18.959 --> 58:21.962
It's aggregate, so I'm talking
about fractions of a penny...

58:22.046 --> 58:25.341
and, uh, over time,
they add up to a lot.

58:25.424 --> 58:29.136
Oh, OK. So you're gonna make
a lot of money, right?

58:29.220 --> 58:30.513
- Yeah.
- Right.

58:30.596 --> 58:31.680
It's not yours?

58:31.764 --> 58:33.933
Uh... well, it becomes ours.

58:34.016 --> 58:35.851
How is that not stealing?

58:38.521 --> 58:41.732
I don't think
I'm explaining this very well.

58:41.816 --> 58:44.902
Um, the 7-Eleven, right?

58:44.985 --> 58:47.238
You'd take a penny
from the tray.

58:47.321 --> 58:48.572
From the crippled children?

58:48.656 --> 58:49.782
No, that's the jar.

58:49.865 --> 58:53.369
I'm talking about the tray...
the pennies for everybody.

58:53.452 --> 58:54.787
Oh, for everybody. OK.

58:54.870 --> 58:56.956
Yeah.
Well, those are whole pennies.

58:57.039 --> 59:00.960
I'm just talking about
fractions of a penny, OK?

59:01.043 --> 59:02.795
But we do it
from a much bigger tray...

59:02.878 --> 59:04.964
and we do it
a couple of million times.

59:05.047 --> 59:06.465
So what's wrong with that?

59:06.549 --> 59:08.175
I don't know.
It just seems wrong.

59:08.259 --> 59:09.426
It's not wrong.

59:09.510 --> 59:10.678
Initech is wrong.

59:10.761 --> 59:13.264
Initech is an evil corporation,
all right?

59:13.347 --> 59:15.432
Chotchkie's is wrong.

59:15.516 --> 59:17.434
Doesn't it bother you that you
have to get up in the morning...

59:17.518 --> 59:19.520
and you have to put on
a bunch of pieces of flair?

59:19.603 --> 59:21.981
Yeah, but I'm not about
to go in and start...

59:22.064 --> 59:23.732
taking money from the register.

59:23.816 --> 59:25.025
Well, maybe you should.

59:26.819 --> 59:30.114
The Nazis had pieces of flair
that they made the Jews wear.

59:30.197 --> 59:31.448
What?

59:33.159 --> 59:34.785
Look, we don't... I'm...

59:34.869 --> 59:36.495
We don't have
to talk about this now.

59:36.579 --> 59:40.082
Let's just go to the barbecue,
all right?

59:43.169 --> 59:45.838
Michael, Samir,
how you doin'?

59:45.921 --> 59:47.047
- Hey, Tom.
- Hello, Tom.

59:47.131 --> 59:50.176
I'd like you to meet
my lawyer Rob Newhouse.

59:50.259 --> 59:52.970
Rob, Michael. Samir.

59:53.053 --> 59:56.515
Peter! How are you?
I'm glad you could make it.

59:56.599 --> 59:59.602
Tom, hi. This is somebody
I'd like you to meet.

59:59.685 --> 01:00:01.520
- This is, uh, Joanna.
- Hi.

01:00:01.604 --> 01:00:04.023
Hi. Forgive me
for not getting up.

01:00:10.696 --> 01:00:13.532
Ooh, ooh.

01:00:13.616 --> 01:00:16.035
Peter, come here a minute.
I wanna show you something.

01:00:17.369 --> 01:00:19.997
Well... what do you think?
It's a prototype.

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.832
Huh... that's...

01:00:21.916 --> 01:00:24.502
that's exactly as you
described it.

01:00:26.504 --> 01:00:29.006
Uh, listen, I heard about
your... your settlement.

01:00:29.089 --> 01:00:30.257
Congratulations.

01:00:30.341 --> 01:00:31.467
Well, thanks, Peter.

01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:35.429
You know, I'm glad you're here,
because I wanted to talk to you.

01:00:35.513 --> 01:00:38.849
I know how you get depressed
about your job and all, and...

01:00:38.933 --> 01:00:41.602
I just wanted you to know
that I know how you feel.

01:00:41.685 --> 01:00:43.354
I used to be the same way.

01:00:43.437 --> 01:00:45.439
- Really?
- Sure.

01:00:45.523 --> 01:00:47.149
Maybe I didn't whine as much.

01:00:47.233 --> 01:00:50.069
But I bet I hated my job
even more than you...

01:00:50.152 --> 01:00:52.446
and I'd been doing it
for over thirty years.

01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:53.823
Wow.

01:00:53.906 --> 01:00:57.451
Just remember, if you
hang in there long enough...

01:00:57.535 --> 01:01:00.788
good things can happen
in this world.

01:01:00.871 --> 01:01:02.957
I mean, look at me.

01:01:03.958 --> 01:01:05.376
Thanks, Tom.

01:01:06.418 --> 01:01:08.295
Ah, sure.

01:01:13.676 --> 01:01:16.887
Conjugal visits?
Not that I know of.

01:01:16.971 --> 01:01:19.598
Minimum-security prison
is no picnic.

01:01:19.682 --> 01:01:21.809
I have a client in there
right now.

01:01:21.892 --> 01:01:23.519
He says the trick is...

01:01:23.602 --> 01:01:25.437
kick someone's ass
the first day...

01:01:25.521 --> 01:01:26.981
or become someone's bitch.

01:01:27.064 --> 01:01:29.650
Then everything
will be all right.

01:01:29.733 --> 01:01:31.360
Why do you ask, anyway?

01:01:31.443 --> 01:01:33.696
Oh, no, we just...

01:01:33.779 --> 01:01:34.989
It's a...

01:01:41.245 --> 01:01:43.289
- Hey, Peter.
- Drew.

01:01:43.372 --> 01:01:45.541
That's something
about old Smykowski, huh?

01:01:45.624 --> 01:01:47.418
- Yeah.
- Lucky bastard.

01:01:48.586 --> 01:01:51.755
Hey, isn't that the girl
that works over at Chotchkie's?

01:01:51.839 --> 01:01:53.591
Yep.

01:01:53.674 --> 01:01:55.259
Who's she here with?

01:01:55.342 --> 01:01:56.635
She's with me.

01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:00.598
- Really?
- Yep.

01:02:00.681 --> 01:02:04.143
All right, Peter.
Ooh, ooh, right on.

01:02:05.186 --> 01:02:07.313
Make sure you wear a rubber,
dude.

01:02:09.607 --> 01:02:10.733
Why's that, Drew?

01:02:10.816 --> 01:02:12.443
Are you kidding me?

01:02:12.526 --> 01:02:14.612
She gets around. All right?

01:02:16.113 --> 01:02:18.115
She does, does she?

01:02:18.199 --> 01:02:20.326
Oh, yeah, like a record.

01:02:23.204 --> 01:02:24.622
Like with who?

01:02:24.705 --> 01:02:27.625
Oh, let's see, uh...

01:02:27.708 --> 01:02:29.877
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

01:02:31.003 --> 01:02:32.713
Uh, let me see, who else?

01:02:34.798 --> 01:02:35.966
Lumbergh?

01:02:38.344 --> 01:02:40.679
What if you get caught?

01:02:40.763 --> 01:02:43.974
Oh, I just don't know
if this was such a good idea.

01:02:44.058 --> 01:02:47.102
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
for you to sleep with Lumbergh.

01:02:47.186 --> 01:02:48.521
What?

01:02:48.604 --> 01:02:49.814
What are you...

01:02:50.981 --> 01:02:52.942
Oh, right, Lumbergh.

01:02:53.025 --> 01:02:54.485
Aah!

01:02:54.568 --> 01:02:57.696
Oh... God... Lumbergh!

01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:59.782
Peter, what is wrong with you?

01:02:59.865 --> 01:03:01.575
That was, like, two years ago.

01:03:01.659 --> 01:03:03.035
What? Did you know him?

01:03:03.118 --> 01:03:04.703
Yeah, I know him. I know him.

01:03:04.787 --> 01:03:06.080
He's my boss.

01:03:06.163 --> 01:03:09.583
He's my unholy,
disgusting pig of a boss.

01:03:09.667 --> 01:03:11.710
Oh, he's not that disgusting.

01:03:11.794 --> 01:03:15.005
He represents all
that is soulless and wrong...

01:03:15.089 --> 01:03:16.799
and you slept with him.

01:03:16.882 --> 01:03:20.261
Hey, that is none
of your business, OK?

01:03:20.344 --> 01:03:23.180
I didn't ask you who you slept
with before we were together.

01:03:23.264 --> 01:03:24.431
I don't care.

01:03:24.515 --> 01:03:26.600
I didn't think you
slept with guys like Lumbergh!

01:03:26.684 --> 01:03:28.853
Listen to you.

01:03:28.936 --> 01:03:30.396
Who do you think you are?

01:03:30.479 --> 01:03:32.982
How dare you judge me?

01:03:33.065 --> 01:03:35.860
I mean, what are you?
You think you're an angel?

01:03:35.943 --> 01:03:38.654
No, you're just
this penny-stealing...

01:03:38.737 --> 01:03:41.407
wannabe criminal man.

01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:43.159
Yeah, well, that may be.

01:03:43.242 --> 01:03:45.703
But at least I never
slept with Lumbergh.

01:03:45.786 --> 01:03:47.079
OK, that's... I'm done.

01:03:47.163 --> 01:03:50.416
I wanna get out of the car, OK?
Stop.

01:03:50.499 --> 01:03:52.293
Call me when you grow up.

01:03:52.376 --> 01:03:54.545
Wait. That's probably
never gonna happen.

01:03:54.628 --> 01:03:55.754
So don't call me, OK?

01:03:55.838 --> 01:03:58.048
Say hello to Lumbergh for me!

01:04:04.972 --> 01:04:06.765
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

01:04:06.849 --> 01:04:08.392
Lumbergh fucked her.

01:04:08.476 --> 01:04:10.644
Lumbergh fucked her.

01:04:10.728 --> 01:04:12.646
That is great.

01:04:12.730 --> 01:04:15.774
I mean, she was seeing
the "Oh" face for sure.

01:04:15.858 --> 01:04:19.612
Ohh, ohh, ohh.

01:04:19.695 --> 01:04:21.280
Ooh.

01:04:21.363 --> 01:04:23.991
If you could just move
a little bit to the left.

01:04:24.074 --> 01:04:26.452
That's it. Great.

01:04:26.535 --> 01:04:28.662
Peter, what's happening?

01:04:28.746 --> 01:04:33.626
Um, could you give me
those T.P.S. reports ASAP, OK?

01:04:33.709 --> 01:04:34.877
Oh!

01:04:49.099 --> 01:04:50.684
- Joanna.
- Yeah.

01:04:51.268 --> 01:04:53.062
We need to talk.

01:04:53.145 --> 01:04:55.022
Do you know what this is about?

01:04:58.943 --> 01:05:00.611
My, uh, flair?

01:05:00.694 --> 01:05:02.780
Yeah.

01:05:02.863 --> 01:05:06.659
Or your lack of flair,
because, uh...

01:05:06.742 --> 01:05:09.119
I'm counting,
and I only see fifteen pieces.

01:05:09.203 --> 01:05:11.497
Let me ask you a question,
Joanna.

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:15.709
What do you think of a person
who only does the bare minimum?

01:05:17.253 --> 01:05:19.964
Huh, what do I think?
Um, you know what, Stan...

01:05:21.215 --> 01:05:24.260
if you want me to wear
thirty-seven pieces of flair...

01:05:24.343 --> 01:05:26.637
like your, uh, pretty boy
over there, Brian...

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.305
why don't you just
make the minimum...

01:05:28.389 --> 01:05:30.349
thirty-seven pieces of flair?

01:05:30.432 --> 01:05:33.018
Well, I thought
I remembered you saying...

01:05:33.102 --> 01:05:35.312
that you wanted
to express yourself.

01:05:35.396 --> 01:05:37.356
Yeah.
You know what? Yeah, I do.

01:05:37.439 --> 01:05:39.900
I do want to express myself.

01:05:39.984 --> 01:05:42.820
And I don't need thirty-seven
pieces of flair to do it.

01:05:44.363 --> 01:05:46.949
All right? There's my flair. OK?

01:05:47.032 --> 01:05:51.328
And this is me
expressing myself. OK?

01:05:51.412 --> 01:05:53.122
There it is.

01:05:53.205 --> 01:05:54.748
I hate this job.

01:05:54.832 --> 01:05:57.501
I hate this goddamn job,
and I don't need it.

01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:14.393
Oh, shit.

01:06:14.477 --> 01:06:16.061
- Shit.
- Shit.

01:06:16.145 --> 01:06:18.647
- Shit.
- Son of a bitch.

01:06:18.731 --> 01:06:21.442
- Shit.
- This is a fuck.

01:06:21.525 --> 01:06:22.610
I... I... Shit.

01:06:22.693 --> 01:06:24.111
What happened?

01:06:24.195 --> 01:06:26.363
You tell me, Michael!
It's your software!

01:06:26.447 --> 01:06:27.990
Yes, it's your software.

01:06:28.073 --> 01:06:30.242
Corporate accounting
is sure as hell gonna notice...

01:06:30.326 --> 01:06:32.995
three hundred five thousand,
three hundred...

01:06:33.078 --> 01:06:36.290
twenty-six thirteen, Michael!

01:06:36.373 --> 01:06:37.708
Oh, shit.

01:06:37.791 --> 01:06:39.793
They probably
won't know it's gone...

01:06:39.877 --> 01:06:41.587
for another three or four days.

01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:45.216
Michael! You said this thing
was gonna take two years.

01:06:45.299 --> 01:06:47.760
What happened? You said
the thing was supposed to work!

01:06:47.843 --> 01:06:49.094
Technically, it did work.

01:06:49.178 --> 01:06:50.471
No, it didn't!

01:06:50.554 --> 01:06:53.432
It did not work, Michael, OK?

01:06:53.516 --> 01:06:55.100
OK.

01:06:55.184 --> 01:06:58.312
I must have put a decimal point
in the wrong place or something.

01:06:58.395 --> 01:07:00.940
I always do that. I always
mess up some mundane detail.

01:07:01.023 --> 01:07:05.069
Oh! Well, this is not
a mundane detail, Michael!

01:07:05.152 --> 01:07:06.654
Quit getting pissed at me.

01:07:06.737 --> 01:07:08.656
This was all your idea, asshole.

01:07:09.907 --> 01:07:11.867
All right. OK.

01:07:11.951 --> 01:07:14.453
Let's try not to get
pissed off at each other.

01:07:14.537 --> 01:07:17.039
Let's calm down, try to figure
this thing out together.

01:07:17.122 --> 01:07:20.793
We gotta close that account
before it gets bigger.

01:07:20.876 --> 01:07:25.047
Happy birthday to you

01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:30.094
Happy birthday to you

01:07:30.177 --> 01:07:35.766
Happy birthday, Mr. Lumbergh

01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:39.979
Happy birthday to you

01:07:44.275 --> 01:07:45.609
Looks terrific.

01:07:45.693 --> 01:07:46.819
Mmm.

01:07:46.902 --> 01:07:49.613
Here, Peg, you wanna
get everybody started?

01:07:52.867 --> 01:07:54.034
Mmm.

01:07:54.118 --> 01:07:55.494
Oh, that is terrific.

01:07:55.578 --> 01:07:56.871
Just terrific.

01:07:56.954 --> 01:08:00.749
Thanks, everybody.
I really, really appreciate it.

01:08:00.833 --> 01:08:02.126
It's very special.

01:08:02.209 --> 01:08:04.420
Now, Milton, don't be greedy.

01:08:04.503 --> 01:08:07.756
Let's pass it along and make
sure everyone gets a piece.

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:10.926
But last time I didn't
receive a piece and I was told...

01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:12.511
Just pass.

01:08:12.595 --> 01:08:17.808
OK, here. But this...

01:08:19.393 --> 01:08:22.897
The cake...
There's lots of cake?

01:08:23.939 --> 01:08:26.942
The ratio of people to cake
is too big.

01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:46.921
I could set
the building on fire.

01:08:47.004 --> 01:08:51.091
Is there some way
to just give the money back?

01:08:51.175 --> 01:08:53.969
Hand them a cheque for the exact
amount they're missing?

01:08:54.053 --> 01:08:56.971
I... I think
they'd figure that out.

01:08:57.055 --> 01:08:59.308
Well, we have to do something.

01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:01.393
Maybe we could launder
the money.

01:09:02.728 --> 01:09:04.688
That's a great idea.

01:09:04.772 --> 01:09:05.814
OK, how do we do that?

01:09:05.898 --> 01:09:07.608
I don't know.

01:09:07.691 --> 01:09:09.359
I don't even know what it means.
I was hoping you knew.

01:09:09.443 --> 01:09:11.153
I think coke dealers do it.

01:09:11.237 --> 01:09:13.823
OK, all right.
Do we know any coke dealers?

01:09:14.698 --> 01:09:16.200
My cousin's a cokehead.

01:09:21.705 --> 01:09:23.249
Fuck.

01:09:23.332 --> 01:09:24.582
We're in deep shit.

01:09:24.667 --> 01:09:28.337
Yes, we are in very,
very deep shit.

01:09:33.341 --> 01:09:35.261
- Milton.
- Yes.

01:09:35.344 --> 01:09:36.511
What's happening?

01:09:36.595 --> 01:09:39.098
Say, Milton,
you know what'd be great?

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:40.265
But... no.

01:09:40.349 --> 01:09:42.100
Since you're down here...

01:09:42.184 --> 01:09:45.395
it would be really great
if you could just sort of...

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:48.232
take care of the cockroach
problem we've had in here.

01:09:48.314 --> 01:09:51.318
That's really not my job, and I
haven't received my paycheque...

01:09:51.402 --> 01:09:53.194
For now,
why don't you go ahead...

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:56.615
and get yourself a flashlight
and a can of pesticide...

01:09:56.699 --> 01:09:57.867
and crawl down...

01:09:57.950 --> 01:10:00.369
Bill?
We need you upstairs right away.

01:10:00.452 --> 01:10:02.288
We got a big problem... big.

01:10:02.371 --> 01:10:05.291
Some major glitch in accounting,
a lot of money missing.

01:10:10.504 --> 01:10:11.672
'Scuse me.

01:10:13.507 --> 01:10:14.675
'Scuse me.

01:10:17.344 --> 01:10:21.265
OK... but that's
the last straw.

01:10:21.348 --> 01:10:23.767
Here we go, here we go.

01:10:23.851 --> 01:10:28.105
Uh, launder.
"To clean," no. "To wash..."

01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:31.400
"To conceal the source
of money...

01:10:31.484 --> 01:10:34.737
"as by channeling it through
an intermediary."

01:10:35.529 --> 01:10:36.906
"To conceal..."

01:10:36.989 --> 01:10:39.450
That doesn't really
help us, Michael.

01:10:39.533 --> 01:10:41.243
I can't believe
what a bunch of nerds we are.

01:10:41.327 --> 01:10:43.454
We're looking up money
laundering in a dictionary.

01:10:43.537 --> 01:10:48.042
Yeah, well, you guys
can both eat my ass, OK?

01:10:48.125 --> 01:10:49.835
I can't believe Joanna
slept with Lumbergh.

01:10:49.919 --> 01:10:51.086
That's what I can't believe.

01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:54.131
- Yeah. You didn't know that?
- Yeah, you didn't know that?

01:10:54.215 --> 01:10:56.258
A couple of years ago,
before he moved to Atlanta.

01:10:58.719 --> 01:11:02.598
You mean Ron Lumbergh,
the Initrode guy? The young guy?

01:11:02.681 --> 01:11:05.184
Yeah.
Who'd you think I meant? Bill?

01:11:07.228 --> 01:11:10.064
Her fucking... Her children
would have hooves.

01:11:11.941 --> 01:11:13.609
Ron's not related to Bill,
is he?

01:11:15.069 --> 01:11:16.779
Who's that?

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:19.281
All right, nobody panic.

01:11:19.365 --> 01:11:21.033
Probably just Lawrence.

01:11:24.537 --> 01:11:26.288
Good evening, sir.
My name is Steve.

01:11:26.372 --> 01:11:27.873
I come from a rough area.

01:11:27.957 --> 01:11:29.542
I used to be addicted
to crack...

01:11:29.625 --> 01:11:31.502
but now I'm off
and trying to stay clean.

01:11:31.585 --> 01:11:34.004
That is why I'm selling
magazine subscriptions.

01:11:34.088 --> 01:11:36.090
- No, no.
- Wait a minute.

01:11:36.173 --> 01:11:38.133
You used to be
addicted to crack?

01:11:39.385 --> 01:11:40.928
Yeah. Um...

01:11:42.555 --> 01:11:44.682
Look, I'm very sorry.

01:11:44.765 --> 01:11:47.268
I do not know anything
about any money laundering.

01:11:47.351 --> 01:11:49.770
We're not asking you
about money laundering.

01:11:49.854 --> 01:11:51.230
All we need is for you
to hook us...

01:11:51.313 --> 01:11:53.107
If he doesn't
know anybody...

01:11:53.190 --> 01:11:54.942
No. Wait a minute.

01:11:55.025 --> 01:11:57.945
Look, you just give us
the name of one drug dealer.

01:11:58.028 --> 01:12:00.447
I could talk to him.
I have good networking skill.

01:12:00.531 --> 01:12:01.657
I lied.

01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:04.785
All that stuff I said
about being a crackhead...

01:12:04.869 --> 01:12:07.288
just helps me sell magazines.

01:12:07.371 --> 01:12:09.874
I'm actually an unemployed
software engineer.

01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:16.755
- You're a software engineer?
- Yep.

01:12:16.839 --> 01:12:19.383
Things, they must be
very rough for you.

01:12:19.466 --> 01:12:21.093
Actually, man...

01:12:21.177 --> 01:12:23.179
I make more money selling
magazine subscriptions...

01:12:23.262 --> 01:12:24.722
than I ever did at Initrode.

01:12:24.805 --> 01:12:26.932
Heh. At Initrode?

01:12:27.016 --> 01:12:28.976
Wait a minute,
you're not gonna tell anybody...

01:12:29.059 --> 01:12:30.394
about all this stuff
we told you.

01:12:30.478 --> 01:12:33.689
I mean, we know a lot of
the same people. That's...

01:12:35.524 --> 01:12:38.194
Actually, um,
that all depends.

01:12:43.073 --> 01:12:46.160
What am I gonna do with
forty subscriptions to "Vibe"?

01:12:47.453 --> 01:12:48.537
We never should have done this.

01:12:48.621 --> 01:12:50.456
What were we thinking?

01:12:51.373 --> 01:12:52.458
You know what I can't
figure out?

01:12:52.541 --> 01:12:55.711
How is it that all these stupid
Neanderthal Mafia guys...

01:12:55.794 --> 01:12:57.171
can be so good at crime...

01:12:57.254 --> 01:12:59.757
and smart guys like us
can suck so badly at it?

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.383
We're new to it, though.

01:13:01.467 --> 01:13:03.969
If we had more experience...

01:13:04.053 --> 01:13:07.431
No. You know what I think?
I think we're screwed.

01:13:07.515 --> 01:13:08.974
I think
there's enough evidence...

01:13:09.058 --> 01:13:11.101
all over that building
to link us to this.

01:13:11.185 --> 01:13:13.270
Even if we could launder money,
I wouldn't want to.

01:13:13.354 --> 01:13:14.939
What we've done is bad enough.

01:13:15.022 --> 01:13:16.273
We get caught
laundering money...

01:13:16.357 --> 01:13:18.317
we're not going
to white-collar resort prison.

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.320
No. We're going to federal
"pound me in the ass" prison.

01:13:21.403 --> 01:13:23.447
I don't want to go
to any prison.

01:13:23.531 --> 01:13:25.783
Why the hell did I do this?

01:13:25.866 --> 01:13:28.536
I've never done anything wrong
in my whole life.

01:13:28.619 --> 01:13:29.829
We weren't thinking clearly...

01:13:29.912 --> 01:13:32.081
because you told us
we were losing our jobs.

01:13:32.164 --> 01:13:34.458
Now look at us, we're worried
about going in a prison.

01:13:34.542 --> 01:13:36.752
Don't worry about it.
I'll think of something.

01:13:38.462 --> 01:13:40.506
I'm going home.

01:13:40.589 --> 01:13:41.757
Me, too.

01:13:43.425 --> 01:13:47.596
You are a very...
bad person, Peter.

01:14:07.825 --> 01:14:09.201
Lawrence, you awake?

01:14:09.285 --> 01:14:10.536
Yeah.

01:14:12.288 --> 01:14:13.497
You wanna come over?

01:14:13.581 --> 01:14:14.665
No, thanks, man.

01:14:14.748 --> 01:14:16.959
I don't want you
fucking up my life, too.

01:14:22.506 --> 01:14:25.384
In light of the senselessness
of these heinous crimes...

01:14:25.467 --> 01:14:27.887
that you have committed
against Initech...

01:14:27.970 --> 01:14:30.973
I hereby sentence you,
Michael Bolton...

01:14:31.056 --> 01:14:35.895
and Samir Naan... Nanadajibad...

01:14:35.978 --> 01:14:38.230
to a term of no less
than four years...

01:14:38.314 --> 01:14:41.901
in a federal
"pound me in the ass" prison.

01:14:45.738 --> 01:14:47.531
Peter Gibbons...

01:14:47.615 --> 01:14:50.367
you've led a trite
and meaningless life...

01:14:52.119 --> 01:14:55.039
and you're a very bad person.

01:15:32.284 --> 01:15:33.452
Hey.

01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:37.414
You're not working
at Chotchkie's anymore, huh?

01:15:37.498 --> 01:15:39.667
No, no. I got fired.

01:15:40.459 --> 01:15:42.920
- What happened?
- I flipped off my boss.

01:15:43.003 --> 01:15:45.089
Some customers...

01:15:45.172 --> 01:15:46.924
Actually, a line cook...

01:15:47.007 --> 01:15:49.009
but he just happened
to be standing there, so...

01:15:50.302 --> 01:15:52.388
I might be going away
for a while.

01:15:52.471 --> 01:15:55.891
Uh... to jail.

01:15:55.975 --> 01:15:57.893
You were right
about that computer scam.

01:15:57.977 --> 01:15:59.311
That was a bad idea.

01:15:59.395 --> 01:16:01.981
I'm gonna take the blame for it,
I decided.

01:16:03.149 --> 01:16:05.401
I'm on my way now
to return the money...

01:16:05.484 --> 01:16:07.862
and leave the confession
under Lumbergh's door.

01:16:10.239 --> 01:16:11.490
Joanna, I want to apologize.

01:16:11.574 --> 01:16:14.076
I had no right to get pissed off
at you about Lumbergh.

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.744
Lumbergh is not my problem.

01:16:15.828 --> 01:16:17.872
It wasn't even
the right Lumbergh.

01:16:17.955 --> 01:16:21.834
I don't know why I can't just...
go to work and be happy...

01:16:21.917 --> 01:16:24.336
like I'm supposed to,
like everybody else.

01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:26.589
Peter, most people
don't like their jobs.

01:16:26.672 --> 01:16:30.634
But you go out there and find
something that makes you happy.

01:16:30.718 --> 01:16:32.595
Yeah. Well...

01:16:34.263 --> 01:16:36.307
I may never be happy
at my job...

01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:39.268
but I think that if
I could be with you...

01:16:39.351 --> 01:16:41.353
that I could be happy
with my life.

01:16:41.437 --> 01:16:43.439
I've been a real asshole.

01:16:43.522 --> 01:16:46.609
But, if you'd give it
another shot, I promise...

01:16:46.692 --> 01:16:47.943
OK, shut up.

01:16:52.364 --> 01:16:55.117
Whoa! Hey, what's going on here?

01:16:55.201 --> 01:16:57.703
Get a room, you two! Ha ha!

01:17:01.165 --> 01:17:03.250
I hate that guy.

01:17:54.176 --> 01:17:56.262
Then Mr. Lumbergh
told me to talk to payroll...

01:17:56.345 --> 01:17:58.931
and then payroll told me
to talk to Mr. Lumbergh.

01:17:59.014 --> 01:18:01.600
And I still haven't received
my paycheque.

01:18:01.684 --> 01:18:04.353
And he took my stapler,
and he never brought it back.

01:18:04.436 --> 01:18:06.772
And then they moved my desk
to storage room "B."

01:18:06.856 --> 01:18:08.691
And there was
garbage on it, and...

01:18:08.774 --> 01:18:11.277
Why don't you go back down
and sit at your desk?

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:12.820
Mr. Lumbergh
should be here any minute.

01:18:12.903 --> 01:18:16.115
- Mr. Lumbergh...
- Just go sit at your desk.

01:18:16.198 --> 01:18:18.659
OK. But, I... I'm gonna just...

01:18:26.333 --> 01:18:28.169
I have to take
my stapler back...

01:18:28.252 --> 01:18:31.964
because I told him
it's my stapler.

01:18:36.844 --> 01:18:38.679
It's my stapler.

01:18:38.762 --> 01:18:42.516
A Swingline, the brand
I've been using for a long time.

01:19:01.702 --> 01:19:03.037
Lawrence, you in there?

01:19:04.872 --> 01:19:06.916
Whoa. Hey, Peter, man.

01:19:06.999 --> 01:19:08.667
Hey.

01:19:08.751 --> 01:19:10.961
So, I might be going away
for a while.

01:19:11.045 --> 01:19:12.963
Yeah, I know, man.

01:19:13.047 --> 01:19:15.549
It's a bummer, dude.
What can I say?

01:19:15.633 --> 01:19:17.676
Yeah. Yeah.

01:19:19.345 --> 01:19:22.848
Well, time to go face the music.

01:19:22.932 --> 01:19:25.518
You take care of yourself
if I don't see you, all right?

01:19:25.601 --> 01:19:28.103
You too, man.
Take her easy, bud.

01:19:28.187 --> 01:19:29.647
All right.

01:19:30.773 --> 01:19:32.149
Hey, Peter.

01:19:32.233 --> 01:19:33.901
Yeah?

01:19:35.027 --> 01:19:36.695
Watch out for your cornhole,
bud.

01:19:38.197 --> 01:19:39.615
OK, Lawrence.

01:19:53.337 --> 01:19:55.840
Stay clear, now.
Stay clear.

01:19:55.923 --> 01:19:58.092
Holy shit.

01:21:07.578 --> 01:21:10.331
Wait a minute.
Let me take a look at that.

01:21:11.165 --> 01:21:12.541
You don't want that, Peter, man.

01:21:12.625 --> 01:21:14.001
That's toasted, man.

01:21:14.084 --> 01:21:17.296
I think I know someone
who might want this.

01:21:28.599 --> 01:21:29.767
Hey, man.

01:21:31.018 --> 01:21:32.812
Wanna go to lunch?

01:21:33.562 --> 01:21:34.855
Brought mine in a pail...

01:21:34.939 --> 01:21:37.525
plus Joanna's supposed
to come by a little later.

01:21:38.526 --> 01:21:40.945
How do you like your new job?

01:21:41.028 --> 01:21:42.947
Not too bad, not too bad.

01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:44.615
How's Penetrode?

01:21:44.698 --> 01:21:46.325
Initrode.

01:21:46.408 --> 01:21:47.701
They're all right.

01:21:47.785 --> 01:21:49.119
It's work.

01:21:49.203 --> 01:21:50.871
Yeah, yeah.

01:21:50.955 --> 01:21:52.623
Probably get you a job there.

01:21:52.706 --> 01:21:54.500
No, thanks. I, uh...

01:21:54.583 --> 01:21:56.001
I'm doing good here.

01:21:57.837 --> 01:22:01.674
So, uh...
we're gonna be OK, right?

01:22:01.757 --> 01:22:03.592
Yeah.

01:22:04.510 --> 01:22:06.971
I think the fire pretty much
took care of everything.

01:22:07.054 --> 01:22:09.640
I wonder if the money burn up.

01:22:09.723 --> 01:22:10.975
It would be shame.

01:22:11.058 --> 01:22:12.434
Yeah.

01:22:12.518 --> 01:22:15.396
So you sure you don't
want us to get you a job?

01:22:15.479 --> 01:22:18.774
That's one thing
I'm definitely sure of.

01:22:20.943 --> 01:22:22.820
All right, chief.

01:22:22.903 --> 01:22:24.155
You guys take care, all right?

01:22:24.238 --> 01:22:25.614
All right.

01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:27.741
Stay in touch, man.

01:22:27.825 --> 01:22:29.577
OK. Will do.

01:22:33.789 --> 01:22:35.708
This isn't so bad, huh?

01:22:36.876 --> 01:22:41.839
Making bucks, getting exercise,
working outside.

01:22:41.922 --> 01:22:43.716
Fuckin' "A."

01:22:46.343 --> 01:22:48.095
Fuckin' "A."

01:23:06.572 --> 01:23:08.782
Excuse me. Excuse me, señor.

01:23:08.866 --> 01:23:10.743
May I speak to you, please?

01:23:10.826 --> 01:23:13.412
I asked for a mai tai,
and they brought a piña colada.

01:23:13.496 --> 01:23:15.789
And I said no salt, no salt...

01:23:15.873 --> 01:23:17.583
for the margarita,
but it had salt on it.

01:23:17.666 --> 01:23:20.252
Lo siento mucho, señor.
Pinche gringo.

01:23:20.336 --> 01:23:23.923
I won't be leaving a tip,
'cause I could...

01:23:24.006 --> 01:23:25.841
I could shut
this whole resort down.

01:23:25.925 --> 01:23:27.468
Sir?

01:23:27.551 --> 01:23:32.014
I'll take my traveler's cheques
to a competing resort.

01:23:33.933 --> 01:23:36.435
I could write a letter
to your board of tourism.

01:23:36.519 --> 01:23:38.771
I could have this place
condemned.

01:23:38.854 --> 01:23:43.609
I could put, I could put
strychnine in the guacamole.

01:23:43.692 --> 01:23:46.237
There was salt on the glass,
big grains of salt.

01:24:01.168 --> 01:24:03.128
Give a ride
on the old bone roller coaster.

01:24:03.212 --> 01:24:05.256
Aaaah!

01:24:19.854 --> 01:24:21.480
Don't come back
in a dress, man.

01:24:21.564 --> 01:24:23.774
Ha ha ha. You big fag.

01:24:46.505 --> 01:24:47.756
I'm working
at Hooters now, you know...

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.842
and it's very cool.

01:24:50.305 --> 01:24:56.723
