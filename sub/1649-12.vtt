WEBVTT

00:02.920 --> 00:04.785
(truck approaches )

00:16.392 --> 00:19.179
Rick:
Dale could get under your skin.

00:20.980 --> 00:23.437
He sure got under mine,

00:25.318 --> 00:28.151
because he wasn't afraid
to say exactly what he thought,

00:29.447 --> 00:31.358
how he felt.

00:35.328 --> 00:37.569
That kind
of honesty is rare

00:40.416 --> 00:42.782
and brave.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.923
Whenever I'd make
a decision,

00:51.135 --> 00:52.841
I'd look at Dale.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.763
He'd be looking back at me
with that look he had.

00:59.727 --> 01:02.719
We've all seen it
one time or another.

01:07.151 --> 01:10.689
I couldn't always read him,
but he could read us.

01:12.114 --> 01:13.979
( whistles )

01:14.158 --> 01:16.274
Rick: He saw people
for who they were.

01:17.620 --> 01:19.406
He knew things about us--

01:20.539 --> 01:22.370
the truth,

01:24.001 --> 01:25.502
who we really are.

01:27.296 --> 01:30.584
In the end, he was talking
about losing our humanity.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.168
(walkers growling )

01:32.343 --> 01:34.800
He said this group
was broken.

01:39.016 --> 01:41.348
The best way to honor him
is to unbreak it.

01:41.519 --> 01:44.386
Set aside our differences
and pull together,

01:44.563 --> 01:48.101
stop feeling sorry
for ourselves

01:48.276 --> 01:50.892
and take control
of our lives,

01:52.196 --> 01:54.312
- our safety...
- ( grunts)

01:54.490 --> 01:56.355
...our future.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.027
We're gonna
prove him wrong.

02:09.213 --> 02:11.329
From now on

02:11.507 --> 02:13.998
we're gonna
do it his way.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.585
That is how
we honor Dale.

02:20.016 --> 02:22.883
(grunting)

02:35.239 --> 02:36.900
(shouts)

02:37.074 --> 02:38.939
( wheezes )

02:49.211 --> 02:51.793
(theme music playing )

03:25.247 --> 03:28.114
Rick: Gonna be tight,
14 people in one house.

03:28.292 --> 03:30.283
Hershel:
Don't worry about that.

03:30.461 --> 03:32.918
With the swamp hardening,
the creek drying up...

03:33.089 --> 03:34.829
With 50 head of cattle
on the property,

03:35.007 --> 03:36.918
we might as well be ringing
a damn dinner bell.

03:37.093 --> 03:40.506
She's right. We should've
moved you in a while ago.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.426
All right, let's move
the vehicles near each of the doors

03:44.600 --> 03:46.340
- facing out toward the road.
- Just leave it there.

03:46.519 --> 03:48.100
Rick: We'll build
a lookout in the windmill,

03:48.270 --> 03:50.556
another in the barn loft.
That should give us sightlines

03:50.731 --> 03:52.187
both sides of the property.

03:52.358 --> 03:55.145
T-Dog, you take the perimeter
around the house.

03:55.319 --> 03:56.604
Keep track of everyone
coming and going.

03:56.779 --> 03:57.939
What about standing guard?

03:58.114 --> 04:00.275
I need you and Daryl
on double duty.

04:00.449 --> 04:02.064
Gotcha.

04:02.243 --> 04:05.451
l'll stock the basement
with food and water,

04:05.621 --> 04:08.829
enough that we can all survive
there a few days if need be.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.284
What about patrols?

04:10.459 --> 04:11.699
Let's get this area
locked down first.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.833
After that,
Shane'll assign shifts

04:14.004 --> 04:17.792
while me and Daryl take Randall
offsite and cut him loose.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.428
We're back to that now?

04:22.638 --> 04:24.344
It was the right plan
first time around.

04:24.515 --> 04:26.051
Poor execution.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.635
That's a slight understatement.

04:27.810 --> 04:30.051
You don't agree,
but this is what's happening.

04:30.229 --> 04:32.345
Swallow it. Move on.

04:32.523 --> 04:34.514
You know that Dale's death
and the prisoner--

04:34.692 --> 04:36.853
that's two separate things, right?

04:38.612 --> 04:40.694
You wanna take Daryl
as your wingman,

04:40.865 --> 04:42.947
be my guest.

04:44.076 --> 04:46.112
- Thank you.
- You got it.

04:58.716 --> 05:01.048
(engine starts)

05:09.268 --> 05:11.634
Hershel: | see why you're not
taking Shane with you.

05:11.812 --> 05:16.306
Just know I've got no more
patience where he's concerned.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.600
He's turning over a new leaf.

05:21.906 --> 05:23.316
Andrea.

05:24.450 --> 05:26.156
When I'm out with Daryl,

05:26.327 --> 05:28.818
help Hershel keep an eye
on things around here.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.952
Me?

05:31.123 --> 05:33.500
Shane's got a way of letting things
get out of hand,

05:33.667 --> 05:36.249
especially when
he's all torqued up.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.911
I think we're all
a bit torqued up at this point.

05:39.089 --> 05:42.047
If you're staying here permanently,
he's got to understand

05:42.218 --> 05:45.551
that it's what Rick and I say,
not whatever he wants.

05:45.721 --> 05:48.633
- You've become close.
- We talk.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.547
Then you know
he's not a bad guy.

05:50.726 --> 05:52.717
He's just
his own worst enemy.

05:52.895 --> 05:54.977
You want me
to babysit Shane?

05:55.147 --> 05:57.854
I need to make sure
every time I leave the farm

05:58.025 --> 05:59.390
all hell doesn't break loose.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.105
Then maybe
you should stop leaving.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.943
- Will you keep an eye on things?
- Of course.

06:13.207 --> 06:15.243
(squeaking )

06:18.379 --> 06:21.121
- Hey, Shane?
- What's up, man?

06:21.298 --> 06:23.960
What you doing,
wandering around by yourself?

06:25.553 --> 06:27.589
If, um--
if I tell you something,

06:27.763 --> 06:29.754
will you promise
not to tell my parents?

06:29.932 --> 06:33.470
I think it's probably a bad idea
for both of us, bud.

06:37.106 --> 06:39.472
(sighs)

06:40.568 --> 06:42.854
Hey, Carl.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.768
Why don't you come on back?

06:53.581 --> 06:55.663
Go on.

06:59.837 --> 07:02.453
I took it from Daryl's motorcycle.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.963
If he found out I took it,
he'd kill me.

07:05.134 --> 07:07.420
(sighs)

07:07.595 --> 07:09.210
What were you doing
with this?

07:13.726 --> 07:17.093
Dale. It's my fault
that he died.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.812
Carl, why would you say that, man?
He got bit by a walker.

07:20.983 --> 07:22.598
- Why are you saying that?
- I saw that walker.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.687
l was gonna shoot it.

07:27.656 --> 07:30.068
(sighs)

07:31.619 --> 07:33.325
It was stuck in the mud.

07:33.495 --> 07:36.532
l was-- I was throwing
rocks at it and stuff.

07:36.707 --> 07:40.245
But I was gonna do it--
shoot it right in the head.

07:40.419 --> 07:43.456
And it-- it got free,
came after me and...

07:45.132 --> 07:48.090
I ran away. lfl had killed it,
Dale would still be here.

07:48.260 --> 07:49.796
Carl, I want you
to stop that, okay?

07:51.138 --> 07:52.594
This ain't your fault.

07:52.765 --> 07:54.756
But you need
to hold onto this.

07:54.933 --> 07:57.015
You need
to protect yourself.

07:59.271 --> 08:01.432
As long as I'm around you,
nothing's gonna happen to you, Carl.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.689
But I can't keep
my eyes on you 24/7.

08:03.859 --> 08:05.690
Only you can do that.
Carl, take it.

08:05.861 --> 08:07.442
I'm never touching
another gun again.

08:07.613 --> 08:10.195
- That ain't an option, Carl, okay?
- Just give it back to Daryl.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.718
(squeaking )

08:43.649 --> 08:45.685
( breathing heavily )

08:48.028 --> 08:50.064
(grunting)

08:59.331 --> 09:00.946
The men are in there.

09:08.090 --> 09:10.627
You can put your stuff
upstairs in my room.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.716
With your dad
in the house?

09:16.265 --> 09:19.632
ljust-- I'm just gonna
put my stuff over there.

09:31.613 --> 09:34.104
Whoa. Don't--don't--
don't strain yourself.

09:35.117 --> 09:36.778
Thank you.

09:36.952 --> 09:39.944
Rick and Carl and l are taking
the corner of the living room.

09:41.165 --> 09:43.281
You can put that
in my room.

09:43.459 --> 09:46.246
You'll be
more comfortable there.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.626
We can't do that.

09:47.796 --> 09:49.707
A pregnant woman and child
sleeping on the floor

09:49.882 --> 09:52.624
- while I've got a bed to myself?
- This is still your house.

09:52.801 --> 09:56.464
It's our home.
I'll take the couch downstairs.

09:56.638 --> 09:59.129
On nights when I came home
reeking of bourbon,

09:59.308 --> 10:01.720
my wife would lock
the bedroom door.

10:01.894 --> 10:05.762
I'm sad to say that couch
and | become old friends.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.191
If you two can't decide,
I'll take it.

10:09.485 --> 10:12.227
Thank you.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.144
The couch is mine.

10:14.323 --> 10:18.191
It's gonna get real cozy
real fast in here.

10:23.415 --> 10:25.451
( distant hammering )

10:30.798 --> 10:33.164
( hammering continues)

10:36.053 --> 10:38.635
Wouldn't that be easier
if you waited for some help?

10:38.806 --> 10:42.264
Ain't no use waiting for
something that ain't gonna come.

10:42.434 --> 10:44.891
No, I'll just--

10:45.062 --> 10:47.223
just do it all myself.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.146
Yeah, you always do,

10:50.317 --> 10:53.024
just like that time you showed up
Rick fixing our sink.

10:53.195 --> 10:55.481
( laughs )
Yeah.

10:55.656 --> 10:58.693
Just so you know, that's not the reason
your basement flooded.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.279
You can thank Rick
for that--

11:01.453 --> 11:04.570
using rubber washers
with a metal pipe.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.163
Please come down.

11:22.266 --> 11:26.259
So after Sophia, |--

11:28.897 --> 11:31.058
I thought
we'll figure this out.

11:31.233 --> 11:35.647
You know,
we'll heal somehow.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.572
After Dale?

11:44.580 --> 11:46.116
This is real.

11:49.418 --> 11:51.329
And we can't...

11:51.503 --> 11:54.165
keep it at bay.
It's already got us.

11:56.466 --> 11:59.378
And itjust
keeps coming, doesn't it?

12:02.598 --> 12:05.681
I made a mess of things.

12:05.851 --> 12:08.433
I put you and Rick at odds.

12:09.688 --> 12:12.475
I don't even know
whose baby this is.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.069
I can't imagine
how hard that is on you.

12:22.659 --> 12:26.447
You led us out of Atlanta
with no thought for yourself.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.122
( crying )
Do you remember that night?

12:31.293 --> 12:34.160
The flames, the--

12:36.089 --> 12:37.920
and I'm sitting in your car

12:38.091 --> 12:40.673
thinking, "We're gonna
be all right.

12:40.844 --> 12:43.551
He's gonna make it all right.
We'll get out of here."

12:44.932 --> 12:47.173
And I never
thanked you for that.

12:49.811 --> 12:52.143
Even though things got...

12:52.314 --> 12:56.057
( chuckles )
confused between us,

12:58.445 --> 13:00.106
you were there for me.

13:02.199 --> 13:05.191
You were there for me.
Thank you.

13:10.165 --> 13:12.326
You don't need
to thank me for that.

13:12.501 --> 13:15.334
- Of course I do. Of course I do.
- No, you--

13:16.964 --> 13:19.080
Whatever happened
between us,

13:19.257 --> 13:22.124
whatever the hell we thought it was--
and notjust you, but--

13:26.848 --> 13:29.510
I'm sorry, Shane.

13:29.685 --> 13:33.177
Please believe me.
I am so sorry.

13:51.373 --> 13:54.285
Take him out to Senoia--
hour there, hour back,

13:54.459 --> 13:56.791
give or take.
We may lose the light,

13:56.962 --> 13:59.453
but we'll be halfway
home by then.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.373
This little pain in the ass
will be a distant memory.

14:02.551 --> 14:04.416
Good riddance.

14:04.594 --> 14:07.085
Carol's putting together
some provisions for him,

14:07.264 --> 14:09.346
enough to last
a few days.

14:13.645 --> 14:15.601
That thing you did last night--

14:17.315 --> 14:20.102
Ain't no reason you should
do all the heavy lifting.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.232
So are you good with all this?

14:25.407 --> 14:27.693
I don't see you and l
trading haymakers

14:27.868 --> 14:31.076
on the side of the road.
Nobody'd win that fight.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.743
I'm gonna take a piss.

14:39.755 --> 14:41.666
Hey, man,
you seen Carl lately?

14:41.840 --> 14:43.421
He's inside
with his mother.

14:43.592 --> 14:45.457
Look, he came to me.

14:45.635 --> 14:48.422
Okay, I wasn't supposed
to say anything,

14:48.597 --> 14:50.337
but he was out
in the swamps yesterday

14:50.515 --> 14:53.507
and he came across a walker
stuck in the mud.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.676
He got scared, ran off.

14:55.854 --> 14:58.095
The same walker
that killed Dale?

14:58.273 --> 15:00.309
That's the one.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.855
- I'll have Lori talk to him.
- Look, I think--

15:05.030 --> 15:07.021
I think he wants
to talk to his father.

15:07.199 --> 15:09.440
Well, I need this Randall thing
done already.

15:09.618 --> 15:12.530
Man, that needs
to wait, okay?

15:15.874 --> 15:18.240
It's my call.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.789
How about
I ride out with Daryl?

15:21.963 --> 15:24.375
Be good for us to spend
a little time together.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.380
Nah, I need you here.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.626
Don't think
I'll handle it right, huh?

15:29.805 --> 15:31.921
- Didn't say that.
- What did you say?

15:34.851 --> 15:36.432
You know, your son--

15:37.437 --> 15:38.973
he gave me this.

15:39.147 --> 15:40.808
You should get that
back to Daryl, huh?

15:40.982 --> 15:43.143
Freeing that prisoner...
( chuckles )

15:43.318 --> 15:46.230
more important to you
than Carl.

15:53.829 --> 15:55.865
(engine sputtering )

15:58.083 --> 16:01.496
Andrea. Hey, did you try
pumping the gas pedal?

16:01.670 --> 16:03.376
I think it's been
parked too long.

16:03.547 --> 16:04.912
You gotta tap it
three times...

16:05.090 --> 16:06.626
And give her a twist.
I know, I know.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.916
- ( sighs)
- ( engine sputters)

16:09.094 --> 16:11.380
Let me see.

16:25.110 --> 16:27.726
Uh, Dale told me

16:27.904 --> 16:30.111
that in these old vehicles

16:30.282 --> 16:32.147
the points get corroded.

16:33.285 --> 16:35.276
Screwd rive r?

16:36.580 --> 16:38.411
Flathead.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.343
Could you
hand me a file?

17:18.830 --> 17:20.695
I let him down.

17:21.958 --> 17:23.949
He was proud of you.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.368
Maybe not in that moment,

17:26.546 --> 17:28.787
but overall.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.501
Oh, that's easy
for you to say.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.506
You had his back.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.929
l have my share
of regrets,

17:35.096 --> 17:37.633
but I think that he knew

17:37.807 --> 17:40.059
how much
we cared for him.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.847
(crying)

17:48.860 --> 17:50.896
That might do it.

17:58.870 --> 18:00.531
Glenn.

18:18.515 --> 18:20.176
I bet it'll work.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.138
(engine starts)

18:26.147 --> 18:28.274
( laughs)

18:28.441 --> 18:30.432
-( hammering )
- ( sawing )

18:38.952 --> 18:41.409
(engine starts)

18:58.430 --> 19:00.466
Mom said you'd be here.

19:01.933 --> 19:04.345
( sighs )
Told her I would stand lookout.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.469
I got tired of helping
around the house.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.854
Take it.

19:17.407 --> 19:20.945
What happened to Dale
had nothing to do with you.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.823
He died, Dad.

19:26.458 --> 19:27.914
Yeah.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.336
Yeah.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.622
Feels like there's a lot
of that going around.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.589
That's why I need you.

19:41.806 --> 19:44.297
No more kid stuff.

19:45.727 --> 19:47.467
lwish you could have
the childhood I had,

19:47.645 --> 19:49.510
but that's not
gonna happen.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.849
People are gonna die.

19:56.571 --> 20:00.063
I'm gonna die. Mom.

20:01.743 --> 20:04.450
There's no way you can
ever be ready for it.

20:06.081 --> 20:08.163
I try to be, but I can't.

20:08.333 --> 20:11.416
The best we can do now
is avoid it as long as we can,

20:11.586 --> 20:13.702
keep one step ahead.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.466
| wish I had
something better to say,

20:20.637 --> 20:22.878
something--
something more profound.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.557
My father was
good like that.

20:33.691 --> 20:36.273
But I'm tired, son.

20:38.279 --> 20:40.019
Please take it.

20:57.465 --> 20:59.376
(grunting)

21:01.302 --> 21:03.714
( lock clicks)

21:27.245 --> 21:29.281
- ( thuds)
- ( muffled yelp )

21:33.585 --> 21:35.621
( breathing deeply )

21:44.137 --> 21:45.673
(sighs)

22:03.865 --> 22:06.652
(grunts)

22:14.501 --> 22:16.537
( handcuffs rattle )

22:20.840 --> 22:23.377
(whimpering)

22:26.638 --> 22:28.594
- ( chuckles)
- ( moans)

22:41.236 --> 22:44.319
Only got
so many arrows.

22:44.489 --> 22:46.400
Is that Dale's gun?

22:46.574 --> 22:48.735
Yeah.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.243
Wish I knew where
the hell mine is.

22:53.414 --> 22:55.826
- Ready?
- Yeah.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.207
- I'll get the package.
- Thanks.

23:04.092 --> 23:05.798
Yo, Randy.

23:07.095 --> 23:09.131
Governor called.
You're off the hook.

23:20.441 --> 23:22.272
Oh, hell no.

23:22.443 --> 23:25.105
-( leaves rustling )
-( Randall panting )

23:27.448 --> 23:29.985
Shane:
Shh! Go that way.

23:33.121 --> 23:34.736
Go on, go on.

23:38.626 --> 23:41.709
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Now, look.

23:41.879 --> 23:44.256
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Hey, hey, come on. Come on.

23:44.424 --> 23:46.915
| get it. I'm the last face you probably
want to see, huh?

23:47.093 --> 23:49.459
Listen, I'm gonna take you
up out of here, okay?

23:49.637 --> 23:51.923
I'm gonna get this off
of you so you can breathe,

23:52.098 --> 23:53.804
but I want you
to keep quiet.

23:53.975 --> 23:56.637
You listen good.
Do you hear me? Okay.

23:56.811 --> 23:58.312
- Don't do nothing stupid.
- ( moans)

23:58.479 --> 23:59.980
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
- ( whimpers)

24:00.148 --> 24:01.854
Hey, hey, keep it quiet.

24:04.152 --> 24:06.814
Now your group--
you know where they're at?

24:06.988 --> 24:08.819
- No, I don't. I really--
- Okay.

24:08.990 --> 24:11.481
Get your little ass up here.
Now I'm the only shot

24:11.659 --> 24:13.820
of you getting out of these
woods alive. You hear me?

24:13.995 --> 24:16.452
Now you start talking, boy.
Where are they at?

24:16.623 --> 24:19.990
We had a camp
set up off the highway.

24:20.168 --> 24:21.999
About five miles from here.

24:22.170 --> 24:25.003
- Okay. Okay.
- Who knows if they're still there?

24:25.173 --> 24:28.040
Okay. So you're gonna
take me to 'em?

24:29.177 --> 24:31.168
Why?

24:31.346 --> 24:33.337
Because, man, |--
I'm just--

24:33.514 --> 24:35.254
I'm done
with this group, man.

24:35.433 --> 24:37.424
They're doomed and I want
no part of it.

24:37.602 --> 24:41.686
- That's all.
- So you're not gonna kill me?

24:41.856 --> 24:44.472
Come on, man.
If I was, you'd be dead.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.767
Come on.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.855
Hey, you ain't
gotta be so rough.

24:49.030 --> 24:51.396
We're on the same side now.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.281
You're gonna like it with us.

24:54.452 --> 24:56.363
Gets a little crazy
sometimes,

24:56.537 --> 24:58.528
but it's
a tough bunch of guys.

24:58.706 --> 25:00.412
You'll fit in good.

25:01.709 --> 25:03.620
Less talking,
more walking.

25:03.795 --> 25:07.708
Look, I run my mouth
when | get nervous.

25:08.716 --> 25:10.502
I can't help it.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.633
I got a lot
going on, you know?

25:12.804 --> 25:14.385
It ain't all about you.

25:14.555 --> 25:16.716
I ain't saying it's about me.

25:16.891 --> 25:18.677
Just trying to--

25:18.851 --> 25:20.716
- ( screams )
-( bones snap )

25:20.895 --> 25:23.102
(bodythuds)

25:44.919 --> 25:46.750
(grunts)

25:53.594 --> 25:55.721
( panting )

26:10.403 --> 26:11.939
- Maggie: What's wrong?
- Glenn: Randall's missing.

26:12.113 --> 26:14.445
Maggie:
Missing? How?

26:14.615 --> 26:16.606
Hershel:
How long's he been gone?

26:16.784 --> 26:18.445
Rick:
It's hard to say.

26:18.619 --> 26:20.200
The cuffs are
still hooked.

26:20.371 --> 26:23.113
- He must've slipped 'em.
- Is that possible?

26:23.291 --> 26:24.952
It is if you've got
nothing to lose.

26:25.126 --> 26:27.993
The door was secured
from the outside.

26:43.895 --> 26:46.762
( shouting )
Rick! Rick!

26:47.899 --> 26:50.641
- What happened?
- He's armed!

26:50.818 --> 26:52.809
- He's got my gun!
- Carl: Are you okay?

26:52.987 --> 26:54.978
I'm fine. Little bastard
just snuck up on me.

26:55.156 --> 26:57.738
- He clocked me in the face.
- All right, Hershel, T-Dog,

26:57.909 --> 26:59.319
get everybody
back in the house.

26:59.494 --> 27:01.576
Glenn, Daryl, come with us.

27:01.746 --> 27:04.658
- T, I'm gonna need that gun.
- Carol: Just let him go.

27:04.832 --> 27:06.493
That was the plan, wasn't it,
to just let him go?

27:06.667 --> 27:08.168
The plan was to cut him loose
far away from here,

27:08.336 --> 27:09.951
not on our front step
with a gun.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.336
Don't go out there.
Y'all know what can happen.

27:12.507 --> 27:13.747
Get everybody back
in the house.

27:13.925 --> 27:16.291
Lock all the doors
and stay put!

27:16.469 --> 27:19.006
- Let's go, back in the house.
- Okay.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.632
I saw him head up through the trees
that way before I blacked out.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.426
I'm not sure how long.

27:26.604 --> 27:27.969
He couldn't
have gotten far.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.853
He's hobbled,
exhausted.

27:30.024 --> 27:31.935
- Glenn: And armed.
- Rick: So are we.

27:32.109 --> 27:34.361
- Can you track him?
- No, I don't see nothing.

27:34.529 --> 27:36.861
Hey, look, there ain't no use
in tracking him, okay?

27:37.031 --> 27:38.771
He went that way.
We just need to pair up.

27:38.950 --> 27:40.531
We spread out, we just chase
him down. That's it.

27:40.701 --> 27:42.862
The kid weighs
a buck-25 soaking wet.

27:43.037 --> 27:44.777
You trying to tell us
he got the jump on you?

27:44.956 --> 27:47.038
I'd say a rock pretty much
evens those odds, wouldn't you?

27:47.208 --> 27:49.369
All right, knock it off. You and Glenn
start heading up the right flank.

27:49.544 --> 27:51.034
Me and Shane'll
take the left.

27:51.212 --> 27:53.703
Remember, Randall's not
the only threat out there.

27:53.881 --> 27:55.667
Keep an eye out
for each other.

28:03.724 --> 28:06.215
( crickets chirping )

28:32.670 --> 28:34.956
Looks like
it's busted pretty bad.

28:37.258 --> 28:38.794
It's fine, man.

28:39.927 --> 28:41.758
Don't worry about me.

28:53.733 --> 28:56.145
(wings flap )

29:09.373 --> 29:11.113
(sighs)

29:11.292 --> 29:13.328
This is pointless.
Give me a light.

29:24.055 --> 29:26.262
( groans )
Come on.

30:08.683 --> 30:10.594
Glenn:
We're just back to square one.

30:10.768 --> 30:13.851
If you're gonna do a thing,
you might as well do it right.

30:34.625 --> 30:37.332
There's two sets
of tracks right here.

30:37.503 --> 30:40.165
Shane must've followed him
a lot longer than he said.

30:44.552 --> 30:47.089
There's fresh blood
on this tree.

30:51.934 --> 30:53.470
There's more tracks.

30:53.644 --> 30:55.635
Looks like they're
walking in tandem.

30:55.813 --> 30:57.724
(animal howls)

30:58.816 --> 31:00.147
Sorry.

31:03.487 --> 31:05.569
Yeah, there was
a little dust up right here.

31:05.740 --> 31:09.653
- Glenn: What do you mean?
- I mean, something went down.

31:09.827 --> 31:11.692
This is getting weird.

31:13.914 --> 31:15.620
Had a little trouble.

31:21.756 --> 31:24.247
( rustling )

31:30.139 --> 31:31.549
( whistles softly )

31:53.245 --> 31:55.236
(growling)

32:12.932 --> 32:15.139
(gurgles)

32:15.309 --> 32:17.345
( both panting )

32:23.567 --> 32:25.228
Nice.

32:28.948 --> 32:30.609
( squelches )

32:43.671 --> 32:45.536
Does this way feel right?

32:47.174 --> 32:48.550
As right as any.

32:51.929 --> 32:54.841
- Snatched your gun, huh?
- Yeah.

32:55.015 --> 32:57.222
It's my favorite piece, too.

32:57.393 --> 32:58.974
Gonna wish he'd--

32:59.145 --> 33:02.228
wish he'd killed me
when | find his sorry ass.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.353
Go on.

33:16.871 --> 33:18.907
Got his neck broke.

33:29.550 --> 33:31.381
He's got no bites.

33:31.552 --> 33:33.588
Yeah, none you can see.

33:35.306 --> 33:38.264
No, I'm telling you
he died from this.

33:39.852 --> 33:41.888
How's that possible?

34:08.255 --> 34:10.246
Rick:
You say he got you with a rock?

34:10.424 --> 34:12.665
That's what I said.

34:15.638 --> 34:17.924
Inside the shed?

34:23.938 --> 34:27.101
'Cause that door was shut
when T-Dog rolled up.

34:30.736 --> 34:32.601
I saw that, too.

34:34.448 --> 34:37.155
Must've slipped through
the rafters in the roof.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.811
So this is where
you plan to do it?

35:09.316 --> 35:10.817
It's a good place as any.

35:10.985 --> 35:13.897
At least have the balls
to call this what it is--

35:16.824 --> 35:18.735
murder.

35:22.496 --> 35:25.158
You really believe if you walk
back onto that farm alone--

35:25.332 --> 35:27.823
- no me, no Randall--
- I want you to hush up.

35:28.002 --> 35:30.960
You really believe they're gonna buy
whatever bullshit story you cook up?

35:31.130 --> 35:33.337
That's just it.
It ain't no story.

35:34.466 --> 35:37.173
I saw that prisoner
shoot you down.

35:37.344 --> 35:38.845
I ran after him.

35:39.013 --> 35:41.675
I snapped his neck.

35:42.683 --> 35:44.514
It ain't gonna be easy,

35:44.685 --> 35:46.721
but Lori and Carl--
they'll get over you.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.558
They done it before.

35:51.692 --> 35:53.523
They just gonna have to.

35:53.694 --> 35:55.935
( exhales deeply )

35:57.323 --> 35:58.984
Why?

35:59.158 --> 36:01.399
Why now?

36:02.703 --> 36:04.989
I thought we worked
this all out.

36:05.164 --> 36:06.904
( laughs )
We tried to kill each other, man.

36:07.082 --> 36:09.414
What you think?
We was just gonna forget about it?

36:09.585 --> 36:11.416
We gonna ride off
into the sunset together?

36:11.587 --> 36:13.873
You're gonna kill me
in cold blood?

36:15.049 --> 36:16.710
Screw my wife?

36:16.884 --> 36:18.499
Have my children--
my children--

36:18.677 --> 36:20.793
call you Daddy?
Is that what you want?

36:22.264 --> 36:24.380
That life won't
be worth a damn.

36:24.558 --> 36:26.389
I know you.

36:28.062 --> 36:30.223
You won't be able
to live with this.

36:33.233 --> 36:35.315
What you know about
what I can live with?

36:37.237 --> 36:39.569
You got no idea what I can live with,
what I live with!

36:39.740 --> 36:42.231
You wanna talk about
what I can do, Rick?

36:42.409 --> 36:44.741
How about what
you can do? Here lam.

36:44.912 --> 36:47.904
Come on, man.
Raise your gun.

36:49.583 --> 36:52.199
- No. No, lwill not.
- What happened, Rick?

36:52.378 --> 36:54.039
I thought you weren't
the good guy anymore.

36:54.213 --> 36:55.293
Ain't that what you said?

36:55.464 --> 36:57.796
Even right here, right now,
you ain't gonna fight for 'em?

36:57.966 --> 37:00.048
I'm a better father
than you, Rick.

37:00.219 --> 37:02.585
I'm better for Lori
than you, man.

37:02.763 --> 37:05.095
lt's 'cause I'm a better man
than you, Rick.

37:05.265 --> 37:06.880
'Cause I can be here
and I'll fight for it.

37:07.059 --> 37:10.517
But you come back here and you
just destroy everything!

37:14.608 --> 37:16.690
You got a broken woman.

37:18.112 --> 37:19.773
You got a weak boy.

37:19.947 --> 37:23.189
You ain't got the first clue
in how to fix it.

37:25.828 --> 37:27.784
Raise your gun.

37:27.955 --> 37:30.287
You're gonna have
to kill an unarmed man.

37:35.129 --> 37:36.960
Watch my hand.

37:38.090 --> 37:39.705
Nice and easy.

37:50.269 --> 37:52.806
Easy does it.

37:58.444 --> 38:00.810
Now listen to me, Shane.

38:02.698 --> 38:05.485
There is still
a way back from this.

38:05.659 --> 38:07.900
Nothing has
happened here.

38:09.204 --> 38:11.320
We're gonna
lay down our guns

38:12.624 --> 38:15.161
and we're gonna walk
back to the farm

38:17.129 --> 38:18.244
together.

38:22.009 --> 38:23.670
Back to Lori.

38:24.678 --> 38:26.509
Back to Carl.

38:31.518 --> 38:34.100
Put this all behind us.

38:42.362 --> 38:43.863
- ( Shane grunting)
- ( gunshot)

38:44.031 --> 38:45.896
Rick: Shh.

38:51.705 --> 38:54.196
(gurgling)

38:54.374 --> 38:56.365
Damn you for making me
do this, Shane.

38:56.543 --> 39:00.536
This was you, not me!
You did this to us!

39:00.714 --> 39:04.377
This was you, not me!
Not me!

39:08.055 --> 39:10.137
Not me!

39:13.894 --> 39:16.727
(gurgling)

39:27.199 --> 39:29.565
( breathing stops)

39:35.749 --> 39:37.785
(crying)

39:43.423 --> 39:46.085
(wailing)

39:47.427 --> 39:49.008
Son of...

39:59.898 --> 40:01.604
( growls )

40:01.775 --> 40:03.766
( Rick breathing heavily )

40:16.582 --> 40:19.119
( growls )

40:31.513 --> 40:34.050
( growls )

40:39.146 --> 40:40.852
Carl: Dad?

40:54.036 --> 40:55.901
Carl.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.496
You know...

41:04.796 --> 41:06.661
you should be
back home with Mom.

41:06.840 --> 41:09.001
(gun clicks)

41:14.014 --> 41:16.380
( growls )

41:22.981 --> 41:24.846
Just-- just put the--

41:25.025 --> 41:26.731
put the gun down.

41:26.902 --> 41:29.018
( snarls )

41:30.906 --> 41:33.192
It's not what it seems.
Please.

41:33.367 --> 41:35.198
(gunshot)

41:36.995 --> 41:39.156
(whimpering)

41:44.920 --> 41:46.956
(walkers growling )

41:59.351 --> 42:01.057
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

42:34.469 --> 42:37.506
