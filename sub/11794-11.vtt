00:06.873 --> 00:09.843

00:09.876 --> 00:12.846

01:18.078 --> 01:21.147
Our group
project for Economics
is to start a business.

01:21.181 --> 01:23.083
We put our heads
together this weekend,

01:23.083 --> 01:26.986
 and all we got was a headache.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.789
  Hey gang, got any ideas
  for a business yet?

01:29.823 --> 01:31.157
- Nothing.
- Nada.

01:31.191 --> 01:33.193
   - Zilch.
   - The deadline is today.

01:33.226 --> 01:36.096
We're gonna get
an F for sure.

01:36.129 --> 01:37.997
  Here guys,
  these are for you.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.166
   - Gee, thanks.
   - These are nice.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.902
  I made these friendship
  bracelets in Fashion Club.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.671
   Did you make one for me?

01:44.704 --> 01:47.107
 For you, I'm making
 a friendship muzzle.

01:48.608 --> 01:49.943
I'm speechless.

01:49.976 --> 01:51.611
   That's the idea.

01:52.012 --> 01:53.780
( bell rings )

01:56.383 --> 01:58.985
 Good morning,
 my future financial wizards.

01:59.019 --> 02:01.688
 All:
 Good morning.

02:01.721 --> 02:05.625
  Let's get started. Let's hear
  your new business ideas.

02:05.658 --> 02:06.893
  Gentlemen.

02:11.297 --> 02:15.135
   Mr. Tuttle, like,
   we're calling our company

02:15.168 --> 02:17.103
   "Surf and Fold."

02:18.838 --> 02:21.207
 You tie this
 piece of cardboard
 to your bike,

02:21.241 --> 02:25.145
 pedal to the beach,
 and then... show them, dude.

02:25.178 --> 02:27.247
You open it up

02:27.280 --> 02:29.816
  and ride the waves!

02:31.351 --> 02:32.819
You have a comment, Mr.
Slater?

02:32.852 --> 02:35.989
  If you surf on cardboard,
  it'll sink!

02:36.089 --> 02:38.658
Bummer.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.794
  Don't let the skeptics,
  the cynics, and the critics

02:40.827 --> 02:42.262
  talk you out of your dream!

02:42.295 --> 02:46.399
 - Radical.
 - Here's your $100 seed money.

02:46.433 --> 02:49.669
  And may success
  unfold before you!

02:49.703 --> 02:51.738
( repeating )
Motivated,
motivated, motivated...

02:53.773 --> 02:56.209
  Okay, Mr. Poindexter,
  your group's next.

02:56.242 --> 02:57.711
 Okay.

03:01.047 --> 03:04.117
  Now as we all know,
  this is a pocket protector.

03:04.150 --> 03:07.854
 It keeps your
 shirt clean from those
 yucky pen and pencil smudges.

03:07.887 --> 03:10.056
   But it gets dirty itself.

03:10.056 --> 03:14.060
So we plan to revolutionize
active wear with...

03:14.060 --> 03:16.696
  a pocket protector
  protector!

03:18.365 --> 03:23.636
   Mr. Poindexter, do you
   really believe
   in this product?

03:23.670 --> 03:27.073
   - Yes, we do.
   - We do. When do we eat?

03:27.974 --> 03:31.111
Then make it,
promote it and sell it!

03:31.144 --> 03:35.648
  Here's your seed money.
  Plant it and make it grow.

03:35.682 --> 03:37.717
( repeating )
Motivated,
motivated, motivated...

03:39.185 --> 03:43.189
Okay, Miss Spano,
what about your group?

03:43.223 --> 03:46.860
 Well, Mr.
 Tuttle, I'm afraid we
 couldn't agree on anything...

03:46.893 --> 03:49.162
  Until this morning.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.099
  - Kelly, give me your hand.
  - Zack, what are you doing?

03:53.099 --> 03:57.337
 Mr. Tuttle, there's nothing
 more important in life
 than your friends.

03:57.370 --> 03:59.706
   So what better gift
   from a friend to a friend

03:59.739 --> 04:03.843
 than beautiful,
 handmade friendship bracelets!

04:05.178 --> 04:06.880
   Awesome!

04:08.148 --> 04:10.050
  The public is never wrong.

04:10.050 --> 04:13.053
   Ignore the pouters,
   the doubters,
   and the shouters.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.288
   Project approved!

04:15.321 --> 04:18.725
 - Hey guys, we're in business!
 - Slater: All right.

04:20.493 --> 04:23.196
Lisa says she can make
19 bracelets in a day,

04:23.229 --> 04:25.198
  but she isn't gonna
  have time to sleep.

04:25.231 --> 04:26.399
  So?

04:26.433 --> 04:29.736
 If you want to be a success,
 you have to make sacrifices.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.905
   We're gonna need
   a lot more than 19 a day.

04:31.938 --> 04:32.839
 You think so?

04:32.872 --> 04:36.109
 You saw the reaction
 those bracelets got.

04:36.142 --> 04:37.844
  We could get rich.

04:37.877 --> 04:40.313
   Hey, we wouldn't have
   to go to school anymore.

04:40.347 --> 04:42.749
   We could buy the school.

04:45.485 --> 04:48.121
  Fame and fortune,
  the final frontier.

04:48.154 --> 04:50.357
This is your host,
Robin Screech,

04:50.390 --> 04:52.959
  inviting you to another
  symphony of success

04:52.992 --> 04:56.096
 on "Lifestyles of the Rich
 and Shameless."

04:59.366 --> 05:01.768
 We're standing in the building
 that bracelets bought.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.270
 A former school
 converted to a factory by...

05:04.304 --> 05:07.907
  who would have believed it...
  former student Zack Morris,

05:07.941 --> 05:10.744
  now the fifth richest man
  in America.

05:10.777 --> 05:13.713
   Fourth.
   I just bought Bill Cosby.

05:13.747 --> 05:16.049
 Mr. Morris,
 how many friendship bracelets

05:16.049 --> 05:17.884
  do you produce here
  each year?

05:17.917 --> 05:20.887
  Well, let's just ask
  the factory foreman, Robin.

05:21.788 --> 05:23.256
You rang, boss?

05:24.557 --> 05:28.061
 Yes. What was
 our volume last year, Slater?

05:28.061 --> 05:31.231
   Two billion bracelets, boss.
   Yeah.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.066
 Two billion!

05:35.201 --> 05:38.204
  How can you possibly produce
  so many handwoven articles

05:38.238 --> 05:40.073
   in a single year?

05:40.073 --> 05:42.409
 Zack, I gotta get more sleep!

05:42.442 --> 05:44.878
 I know you do, Lisa.

05:44.911 --> 05:48.081
 For Christmas
 I'm giving you a nap.

05:48.114 --> 05:49.549
  Thank you.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.286
Mr. Morris,
President Bush called.

05:53.319 --> 05:55.455
 He wants a friendship bracelet
 for Gorbachev.

05:55.488 --> 05:57.390
  And Vice President Quayle
  broke his

05:57.424 --> 06:00.093
 when he tried
 to put over his head.

06:00.126 --> 06:01.494
Again?

06:03.196 --> 06:05.532
 That fetching young woman
 doing Zack's bidding

06:05.565 --> 06:09.035
 is his childhood chum,
 Jessie Spano.

06:09.035 --> 06:12.272
Beauty and brains,
what a package.

06:13.473 --> 06:15.542
And sir,
your chauffeur is here.

06:15.575 --> 06:17.477
   Send him in, Miss Spano.

06:22.349 --> 06:25.919
 As you can see,
 Zack Morris has not
 forgotten the little people.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.321
  You're due at your yacht club
  in 15 minutes, sir.

06:28.355 --> 06:31.057
 The limo is waiting
 to take you to the helicopter.

06:31.057 --> 06:34.928
  Ahem. You know, Robin,
  this used to be my office.

06:34.961 --> 06:38.164
 Who cares?
 You're not Rich and Shameless.

06:41.167 --> 06:44.337
 Well, Robin, I'd love to chat,

06:44.371 --> 06:47.273
  but I've gotta go live
  my life of luxury.

06:47.307 --> 06:48.575
Hello, darling.

06:48.608 --> 06:51.611
  Let's sail to Hawaii
  and buy it.

06:51.644 --> 06:53.213
 Mmm.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.482
  And there he goes,

06:55.515 --> 06:58.351
following that red carpet
all the way to the top.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.420
Until next time,
this is Robin Screech,

07:00.453 --> 07:04.891
  hoping you all have milkshake
  wishes and
  cheeseburger dreams!

07:08.094 --> 07:10.330
  Okay, Preppie.
  We're here.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.365
Hi, guys.
Thanks for coming over.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.934
  This is so exciting!
  The hottest idea in school,

07:15.035 --> 07:16.336
 and we're all in it together!

07:16.369 --> 07:17.937
  That's right. Yeah.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.539
If we're gonna
make any money,

07:19.572 --> 07:21.574
 we're gonna have
 to mass produce
 these babies.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.310
 My friends in the Fashion Club
 say they can make 60 a day.

07:24.344 --> 07:27.580
 - 80 if we pay them.
 - 60's fine.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.316
 Now, did anybody come up
 with a name for our company?

07:30.350 --> 07:33.219
 Yeah, l did.
 We're selling
 friendship bracelets,

07:33.253 --> 07:35.221
 and we're all friends right?

07:35.255 --> 07:38.658
 What about
 "Friendship Forever"?

07:38.692 --> 07:41.961
 I love it.
 It's so... friendly!

07:42.062 --> 07:43.263
   Perfect.

07:43.296 --> 07:47.067
 Now,
 the next order of business
 is picking a vice president.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.069
 Well, you came up
 with the bracelet idea, Zack.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.437
   So l really think
   it should be you.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.973
 Me? What, are you kidding?
 I'm president.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.108
   Says who?

07:55.141 --> 07:58.078
 Yesterday we all agreed Jessie
 would be the president!

07:58.078 --> 07:59.379
Remember, Zack?

07:59.412 --> 08:01.381
 Yeah, but that was when we
 didn't have anything.

08:01.414 --> 08:04.017
Now we have
a million dollar idea.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.885
  I don't want
  Jessie to blow it.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.354
 Why would l blow it?

08:07.387 --> 08:11.291
 Because you've got to be
 ruthless, cunning and tough
 to be president.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.460
 Not a sensitive
 marshmallow like you.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.528
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

08:15.562 --> 08:20.066
   You cried when Kermit
   and Miss Piggy broke up.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.269
 Well, if that's the way
 you feel, I'll just start
 my own company!

08:24.104 --> 08:26.272
Yeah, you and who else?

08:26.306 --> 08:29.175
- Me else.
- Me else, too.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.177
 You're being unfair.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.246
  What does fair
  have to do with it?

08:33.279 --> 08:35.081
 We're talking
 about business here.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.217
 - Coming, Lisa?
 - How can l?

08:37.250 --> 08:39.152
  The man recognizes
  my genius.

08:39.184 --> 08:42.288
  And l can't leave my best pal
  and my best gal.

08:42.322 --> 08:45.492
 Please, go with them.

08:45.525 --> 08:49.295
 Fine, you start your
 own company and we'll see
 who outsells who.

08:49.329 --> 08:52.465
You bet we will, bubba.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.009
   - There you go.
   - Thanks.

09:03.043 --> 09:06.079
 All right, take yours.
 Thank you.

09:06.112 --> 09:08.848
  There you go.
  All right.

09:12.152 --> 09:17.023
  Well, well, well, if it isn't
  the three marketeers.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.292
   I don't see a booth
   for your product.

09:19.325 --> 09:22.429
But if you beg me,
l might take you back.

09:24.030 --> 09:28.234
 I wouldn't beg you to spit
 if my eyebrows were on fire.

09:29.803 --> 09:33.039
Mr.
Morris, how are our friends
at Friendship Forever?

09:33.039 --> 09:37.077
 Friendly, sir.
 So far our net profit is $120!

09:38.578 --> 09:40.847
   Magnificent, Mr. Morris.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.850
  Miss Spano, l hear
  you spawned
  a separate company.

09:43.883 --> 09:46.186
Yes, Mr. Tuttle.
And we'd like to
 present a video

09:46.219 --> 09:48.555
 that will introduce
 our new product to the class.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.057
Slater, if you please?

09:52.158 --> 09:54.427
 This ought to be good
 for a laugh.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.941
  I was never good
  at making friends.

10:07.974 --> 10:10.577
 Never could get
 a date for the dance.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.346
And l tried everything.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.983
   I tried everything
   l could think of.

10:17.017 --> 10:20.387
And then l discovered
"Buddy Bands."

10:20.420 --> 10:23.256
And now for only 3.95,

10:23.289 --> 10:26.092
my dance card is full.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.362
( dance music playing )

10:48.248 --> 10:50.150
- Buddy Bands.
- Buddy Bands.

10:50.183 --> 10:54.087
Buddy Bands.
Hey, they work.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.022
 ( applause )

11:03.063 --> 11:06.466
 You're right, Zack.
 What a joke!

11:06.499 --> 11:08.101
 Mr. Tuttle, l object!

11:08.134 --> 11:10.070
That's the same product
we're selling.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.271
 No, it's not.

11:11.304 --> 11:14.474
 Yours is a stupid wristband
 and ours is a clever headband.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.444
 There's room for
 similar products in
 the marketplace, Mr. Morris.

11:17.477 --> 11:20.180
Look at Pepsi and Coke,
Avis and Hertz.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.982
  Bologna and whipped cream.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.351
He's got a point, Zack.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.419
 Project approved, Miss Spano.

11:26.453 --> 11:29.689
 And l commend the three of you
 on a superlative
 piece of promotion.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.558
   - Thank you, Mr. Tuttle.
   - Thank you.

11:31.591 --> 11:34.327
It's gonna play in selected
classrooms
throughout the week.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.729
( bell rings )

11:35.762 --> 11:40.533
 And Buddy Bands
 are on sale as of right now!

11:40.567 --> 11:42.469
   How's
   Friendship Forever going?

11:42.502 --> 11:44.971
  Downhill.
  We had the market cornered

11:45.005 --> 11:46.506
   and now we're losing out
   to a competitor.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.475
 Really?
 The same thing happened to me

11:48.508 --> 11:50.377
  when they opened a restaurant
  down the street.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.713
  But l got my customers back
  by offering them a premium.

11:53.747 --> 11:57.117
Buy two eggs...

11:57.117 --> 11:59.419
  - get the third one free.
  - Zack: All right.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.588
 Buy three eggs and...

12:03.656 --> 12:05.425
get a chicken.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.131
  You know,
  a premium's not a bad idea.

12:11.164 --> 12:14.067
  Yeah, but what can we offer
  with a friendship bracelet?

12:14.067 --> 12:15.669
 A free friend
 with every purchase?

12:20.507 --> 12:22.275
  Here's your
  friendship bracelet

12:22.308 --> 12:25.412
   and here's
   your friend for an hour.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.592
Okay, Peggy. It's 5:00.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.661
  We're not done yet, friend.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.544
 Screech, what's
 the matter with you?

12:57.577 --> 12:59.746
 For the first time in my life,

12:59.779 --> 13:02.682
   I'm the most popular kid
   in school...

13:03.750 --> 13:06.453
 and it's killing me!

13:08.388 --> 13:10.623
   Zack, you can't ask him
   to make anymore friends.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.158
 Look at him.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.062
  You know,
  you're right, Lisa.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.164
Starting tomorrow,
you're the new premium.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.432
  Me?

13:19.466 --> 13:22.202
 Well,
 hey, there's lots of guys
 who'd like you for a friend,

13:22.235 --> 13:24.604
just don't let it interfere
with your work.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.239
   That's it, Zack.

13:26.272 --> 13:31.311
  I'm outta here and I'm taking
  the Fashion Club with me.

13:31.344 --> 13:34.347
   Screech, would you like
   to rejoin the human race?

13:34.381 --> 13:36.816
  You always said
  l wasn't a member.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.086
  I'll sneak you in.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.722
   Hey, Screech, where are you
   going? You're my friend.

13:42.756 --> 13:47.193
  Sorry, Zack.
  Being your friend
  is too exhausting.

13:48.528 --> 13:49.863
 Here.

14:00.740 --> 14:03.309
 We should have walked out
 on Zack when you did.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.844
   Our company's different.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.347
  I may be President,
  but everyone has equal say.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.617
   - Right.
   - We're like one
   big happy family.

14:10.650 --> 14:14.220
The girls in Fashion Club
can't believe
you're gonna pay them.

14:14.254 --> 14:17.924
  Zack thought "salary"
  was some kind of vegetable.

14:20.427 --> 14:23.063
 There's our former boss now.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.937
  Look, he's pretending
  to close down his business.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.372
 Clever move.

14:35.342 --> 14:38.878
   Guys, l don't think
   he's pretending.

14:38.912 --> 14:41.815
  Hey, Preppie,
  what's the problem?

14:41.848 --> 14:45.218
 Labor shortage?
 Production slowdown?

14:47.287 --> 14:50.090
Don't tell me Bayside's
brilliant business mind

14:50.090 --> 14:51.791
 turned out to be an airhead!

14:51.825 --> 14:55.328
 Hey, I know when I'm licked.

14:55.362 --> 14:57.097
I'll take a Buddy Band,
please.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.406
   Well, all right!
   He's outta there!

15:06.439 --> 15:08.842
   Now we've got a lock
   on the friendship market.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.944
Slater,
you and l are gonna buy
enough fabric

15:11.044 --> 15:12.946
 to make
 300 more Buddy Bands.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.749
   - Let's make it 500.
   - Jessie: Great!

15:15.782 --> 15:19.819
 Lisa, you're gonna get
 the Fashion Club to crank
 them out tonight!

15:19.853 --> 15:22.088
   Wait a minute.
   You want to risk
   all our profits?

15:22.122 --> 15:25.825
 Hey, there's no risk now.
 We eliminated our competition.

15:25.859 --> 15:28.928
Wait a minute.
I thought you said
everyone had equal say.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.363
What about my opinion?

15:30.397 --> 15:32.298
Lisa, there just isn't time
for your opinion!

15:32.332 --> 15:35.368
I want 500 more Buddy Bands
by tomorrow morning.

15:42.175 --> 15:46.780
  Get your Buddy Bands!
  Your forehead's
  naked without one!

15:51.818 --> 15:54.087
   Mr. Belding,
   I've been looking
   all over for you.

15:54.087 --> 15:57.357
  I should have known you were
  here buffing those biceps.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.492
You'd be surprised how many
whistles this arm gets

15:59.526 --> 16:02.028
 when l signal for a left turn.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.132
  Huh? Huh?
  ( laughs )

16:06.166 --> 16:08.034
  Now, sir...

16:08.068 --> 16:11.237
  I'd like you to have
  this Buddy Band
  as a gift from me.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.306
 I thought you were pushing
 friendship bracelets.

16:13.340 --> 16:16.042
   Those are out, sir.
   These are in now.

16:16.042 --> 16:19.079
 I jumped on
 the Buddy Bandwagon.

16:19.112 --> 16:22.716
 You want to give me
 a Buddy Band?

16:22.749 --> 16:25.051
Badly.

16:25.085 --> 16:28.288
  Look, sir, l know
  we've had our differences,

16:28.321 --> 16:30.757
 but having you wear
 my Buddy Band

16:30.790 --> 16:32.792
   would mean so much to me.

16:33.493 --> 16:37.097
Zack, this is historic.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.798
We're relating!

16:38.832 --> 16:41.134
 Not as principal and student,

16:41.167 --> 16:44.771
   not as detentioner
   and detentionee,

16:44.804 --> 16:46.806
but as Zack and Richie.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.242
We're having
a moment here, brother.

16:51.378 --> 16:54.280
Boy, these things
really do work.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.084
 Here you go.
 Thanks for
 shopping Buddy Bands.

16:58.084 --> 17:01.221
 Who would've ever guessed
 Buddy Bands
 would be such a hit?

17:09.029 --> 17:12.866
  Hey, fellow Buddy Bander.
  Looking good.

17:15.335 --> 17:18.771
  I see you and Mr. Belding
  have the same
  taste in headgear.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.240
Personally, l wouldn't
be caught dead

17:20.272 --> 17:22.208
   wearing anything
   the principal would wear.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.279
  - I want my money back.
  - Why? Is something wrong?

17:26.311 --> 17:29.315
 We'll be glad to refund
 your money if your Buddy
 Band's defective.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.817
Belding's wearing one.

17:30.850 --> 17:33.553
   You can't get
   more defective than that.

17:50.170 --> 17:54.074
 Here we go,
 500 more Buddy Bands.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.109
 This should last
 for at least an hour.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.448
   Was it something l said?

18:04.851 --> 18:08.388
  It's all my fault!
  It's all my fault!

18:08.421 --> 18:10.190
 Why is it your fault?

18:10.223 --> 18:12.525
  Because I was afraid to blame
  greedy Miss Jessie.

18:12.559 --> 18:15.128
She's bigger than l am.

18:15.161 --> 18:16.329
  Well, he's right, you know.

18:16.363 --> 18:19.599
You and Slater
wanted to crush Zack
so much you got greedy.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.568
   Come on, give me a break.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.036
You are greedy.

18:23.036 --> 18:24.904
   Face it,
   you guys went overboard.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.474
 - Let me tell you something...
 - Let me tell you something.

18:27.507 --> 18:30.110
 - ( all shouting )
 - All right, hold it!

18:30.143 --> 18:32.112
They're right, Jessie.

18:32.145 --> 18:36.049
  We tried to beat Zack and we
  wound up beating ourselves.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.055
   Look who's here.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.497
  Why aren't you
  sitting with them?

18:50.530 --> 18:53.066
 'Cause they don't like me
 very much right now.

18:53.066 --> 18:55.201
  - I put them out of business.
  - Why?

18:55.235 --> 18:57.170
   'Cause they put me
   out of business.

18:57.203 --> 19:01.307
That's too bad.
Can l get you anything?

19:01.341 --> 19:04.844
  I don't feel like
  having anything right now.

19:04.878 --> 19:08.448
  How about four friends
  with a Screech on the side?

19:11.651 --> 19:13.853
  Do you have our check, Max?

19:13.887 --> 19:16.089
   No, but I think I've got
   something better.

19:21.261 --> 19:25.131
- All: Whoa!
- Slater:
All right, thanks, Max.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.666
   Why don't you thank him?

19:29.235 --> 19:33.039
  Poor Zack.
  He looks so alone.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.941
  Are you guys thinking
  what I'm thinking?

19:35.041 --> 19:36.676
  Yeah, let's get more fries.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.413
Screech,
I'm talking about Zack.

19:45.051 --> 19:47.454
 Zack, let's be friends again.

19:47.487 --> 19:48.922
Really?

19:48.955 --> 19:51.591
 You mean you all forgive me?

19:51.624 --> 19:53.560
   What does this tell you?

19:57.297 --> 19:59.132
  Do you forgive us?

20:00.433 --> 20:02.135
 Sure.

20:05.271 --> 20:08.174
   I've missed you so much.

20:10.076 --> 20:12.412
 My, how you've grown.

20:14.414 --> 20:18.651
  I missed you all, too.
  Come on, sit down.

20:18.685 --> 20:21.154
  I bet Mr. Tuttle will give us
  all Fs tomorrow

20:21.187 --> 20:22.689
 because our products failed.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.291
 Hey, our products didn't fail.
 We did.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.360
   But who says
   we have to fail tomorrow?

20:27.394 --> 20:29.362
   What are you driving at,
   Preppie?

20:29.396 --> 20:33.199
 This baby was a good idea,
 and so was this baby.

20:33.233 --> 20:36.469
   Now, if we put them together
   maybe something
   new can be born.

20:36.503 --> 20:38.238
   Sorry, l have to go home.

20:38.271 --> 20:40.040
   But why?

20:40.073 --> 20:43.643
 My mom wants to be the one
 to tell me how
 babies are born.

20:46.413 --> 20:49.382
 Next, Mr. Poindexter's
 company:

20:49.416 --> 20:53.586
  a final net profit of $270.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.622
 - Boy: Whoa!
 - Boy #2: All right.

20:55.655 --> 20:58.692
   How many pocket protector
   protectors did you sell?

20:58.725 --> 21:00.760
 Well, actually, none.

21:00.794 --> 21:03.563
   We used a $100
   to buy out Surf and Fold,

21:03.596 --> 21:07.500
   and we made a bundle selling
   their
   surfboards as car visors.

21:12.439 --> 21:16.209
 Ingenious, inventive,
 and just plain smart!

21:16.242 --> 21:19.479
 I'm giving your project an A,
 and put one on my dashboard.

21:21.414 --> 21:25.418
 Next, it seems Friendship
 Forever and Buddy Bands merged

21:25.452 --> 21:27.220
  and came up
  with a new product.

21:27.253 --> 21:30.156
   Yes, sir, we took friendship
   one step further

21:30.190 --> 21:32.092
and invented...

21:32.592 --> 21:34.194
  Love Cuffs!

21:34.227 --> 21:36.329
  You see, it's a new way
  for guys and girls

21:36.363 --> 21:38.765
   to say how they feel
   about each other.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.634
  Why do l always
  get stuck with him?

21:43.203 --> 21:45.372
It's destiny, darling.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.375
We sold just enough
to break even,

21:48.408 --> 21:50.543
and then gave our inventory
to Nerds R Us.

21:50.577 --> 21:51.611
  That's us.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.481
We feel that friendship
is just a fad,

21:54.514 --> 21:57.550
 so we're going to market
 the Buddy Bands as bookstraps.

21:57.584 --> 22:00.787
You gave away
your inventory?

22:00.820 --> 22:04.324
The goal of this project
was to run
a successful business.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.129
We'd rather be friends.

22:09.162 --> 22:10.630
   I see...

22:10.663 --> 22:13.299
   So we're ready for whatever
   grade you wanna give us.

22:13.333 --> 22:16.803
   But please don't
   make it too low.
   I hyperventilate.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.605
  Miss Spano,

22:19.472 --> 22:21.808
   raise that chin.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.577
 If you learned
 that it was a mistake

22:24.611 --> 22:29.449
  for a company to be cold,
  calculating, and cutthroat,

22:29.482 --> 22:31.418
   if you learned
   that it's better

22:31.451 --> 22:35.588
  to be happy, helpful
  and humane,

22:35.622 --> 22:39.859
why then you've learned
the best
business lesson of all!

22:39.893 --> 22:42.195
   You all get an A!

22:52.739 --> 22:55.308
  ( instrumental
  theme music plays )
