00:03.544 --> 00:06.130
If the demon tablet shuts the gates
of hell, what can the angel tablet do?

00:06.339 --> 00:09.717
I can't let you take that, Dean.
I know I have to protect this tablet.

00:09.926 --> 00:11.260
- From Naomi?
- And from you.

00:11.427 --> 00:13.137
From me? What are you talking about?

00:13.346 --> 00:15.515
- Cass. Damn it.
- My name is Naomi.

00:15.723 --> 00:18.476
I know. And I know what you did to Cass
after Purgatory.

00:18.684 --> 00:20.561
They're controlling us, Castiel.

00:20.770 --> 00:24.398
And now Castiel is in the wind
with a hydrogen bomb in his pocket.

00:24.607 --> 00:26.442
God built a series of tests.

00:26.651 --> 00:28.778
When you do all three,
you can slam the gates.

00:28.986 --> 00:30.821
- The second trial?
- An innocent soul...

00:31.030 --> 00:33.449
...has to be rescued from hell
and delivered unto heaven.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.076
Aah!

00:35.243 --> 00:36.494
It's done.

00:37.245 --> 00:40.248
Second trial hit you a lot harder
than that first one.

00:40.456 --> 00:42.583
- He's in my head, Dean.
- The fear, the hiding.

00:42.750 --> 00:45.002
And if he's in my head,
he knows where I am.

00:45.169 --> 00:47.380
Thought you could elude me forever?

00:47.588 --> 00:49.590
- He's gone.
- Little geek made a run for it.

00:49.799 --> 00:51.676
Yeah, but where?

01:31.048 --> 01:32.842
Kevin. Come on, it's us. Open up.

01:34.594 --> 01:35.720
We're bleeding out here.

01:37.930 --> 01:38.973
Come on, man. It's me.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.436
- Now it's wet me.
- You forgot the knock.

01:43.644 --> 01:45.521
What's the point if you don't use it?

01:45.730 --> 01:47.815
Sorry, Kevin.

01:49.900 --> 01:51.277
We got it.

01:56.657 --> 01:58.200
Got what?

01:59.201 --> 02:02.163
We caught a tip that Crowley
was moving his Earth-side operations...

02:02.371 --> 02:06.709
- ...so we, uh, laid ourselves an awesome trap.
- And it worked.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.503
We got the other half of the tablet.

02:11.130 --> 02:12.840
What?

02:13.341 --> 02:15.676
It's the light
at the end of your tunnel, kid.

02:16.260 --> 02:18.471
Don't say we never got you nothing.

02:19.180 --> 02:22.141
Holy crap. Are you kidding?

02:23.392 --> 02:24.644
We can get the third trial.

02:25.978 --> 02:29.774
We can finally figure out how to close
the gates of hell on Crowley's ass forever.

02:30.441 --> 02:31.942
Sounds good to me.

02:32.151 --> 02:34.570
We digging up the other half of that thing
or what?

02:36.030 --> 02:37.448
Don't need to.

02:40.785 --> 02:44.789
So, uh, ahem, Special K,
you keep your nose to the God-stone.

02:44.997 --> 02:46.916
We're gonna drive out
and make a lot of noise...

02:47.083 --> 02:50.419
...a long way from here,
keep the safe boat safe for you.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.591
We'll be back
as soon as we can, okay?

02:58.552 --> 02:59.887
I guess he's okay.

03:00.096 --> 03:02.431
All right. Don't forget
to lock up after us.

03:33.629 --> 03:36.173
So it's three trials.

03:36.841 --> 03:40.136
Three trials and the Winchesters
get to lock the door on me.

03:42.638 --> 03:43.931
Ha!

03:44.140 --> 03:47.643
You, fake Sam...

03:47.810 --> 03:49.437
...if you're gonna tip our hand...

03:49.645 --> 03:52.356
...I'll have to scrub
Kevin's short-term memory again...

03:52.565 --> 03:56.068
...and that's risky.
So watch the patois in there.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.486
Patois?

03:58.070 --> 03:59.113
Your slang.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.158
"Special K", "nose to the God-stone."
That's the way Dean speaks.

04:02.324 --> 04:04.869
Sam is...

04:05.035 --> 04:08.164
...more basic, more sincere.

04:08.372 --> 04:14.128
Remember, I want two distinct,
authentic characterizations.

04:15.129 --> 04:16.839
Yes, sir.

04:23.512 --> 04:25.765
I was born to direct.

04:37.276 --> 04:38.527
All right, here we go.

04:38.736 --> 04:43.032
John Winchester's famous
cure-all kitchen-sink stew.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.617
There you go.

04:44.825 --> 04:48.871
Enough cayenne pepper in there to burn
your lips off, like Dad used to make.

04:50.080 --> 04:54.335
You want me to do the whole, uh,
airplane thing with the spoon?

04:56.796 --> 04:58.506
When was the last time you ate?

04:59.298 --> 05:02.676
- I don't...
- Days, Sam. It's been three days.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.224
When did you get that?

05:08.432 --> 05:10.726
When did you start
throwing off heat waves?

05:11.727 --> 05:14.897
- Here.
- Enough. Dean, please.

05:18.234 --> 05:22.571
The bloody handkerchiefs, the fever,
the shaky legs, this is not good.

05:22.738 --> 05:24.323
Well, I'm not good...

05:24.532 --> 05:28.828
...and I'm not going to be good
until we can start moving again...

05:29.036 --> 05:30.871
...until I can start the third trial.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.833
Trial? I wouldn't let you start a moped.

05:35.668 --> 05:39.713
We're on the rails with this thing, okay?
And the only way out of it is through it...

05:39.922 --> 05:40.923
...believe me, I know.

05:41.090 --> 05:44.760
And you know how bad I wanna slam the door
on all those sons of bitches.

05:45.427 --> 05:48.264
But you gotta let me
take care of you, man.

05:48.472 --> 05:50.766
You gotta let me help you
get your strength back.

05:52.309 --> 05:55.980
This isn't a cold or a fever...

05:56.188 --> 05:59.400
...or whatever it is
you're supposed to feed.

05:59.608 --> 06:01.569
This is part of it all.

06:01.777 --> 06:05.531
Those first two trials,
they're not just things I did.

06:05.739 --> 06:08.701
They're doing something to me.

06:08.909 --> 06:10.995
They're changing me, Dean.

06:27.344 --> 06:29.972
- It's Kevin.
- Finally.

06:34.810 --> 06:36.520
Sam, Dean...

06:37.354 --> 06:41.358
...I set up this message with some software
and a remote server so it'd send itself...

06:41.525 --> 06:43.986
...if I didn't reset it
with a command once a week.

06:44.653 --> 06:47.156
Which means I didn't reset it this week.

06:47.364 --> 06:49.366
And there's only one reason I wouldn't.

06:49.575 --> 06:52.119
Which means if you're
watching this, then l...

06:53.162 --> 06:55.414
Then I'm dead.

06:59.335 --> 07:01.170
I'm dead, you bastards!

07:01.378 --> 07:04.089
So screw you, screw God
and everybody in between!

07:07.718 --> 07:09.803
Crowley must have gotten to me...

07:10.012 --> 07:13.015
...and the one thing I know
is that I won't break this time.

07:15.059 --> 07:17.311
I'm not sure how I know, but I do.

07:18.228 --> 07:20.898
I've been uploading all my notes
and translations.

07:21.106 --> 07:23.484
I'm sending you the links
so you can get all of it.

07:24.109 --> 07:26.946
You guys are gonna
have to try to figure out the rest.

07:30.908 --> 07:31.951
I'm sorry.

07:34.578 --> 07:37.790
I know it was my job, but I couldn't...

07:42.878 --> 07:44.421
I'm sorry.

07:48.884 --> 07:50.511
Damn it!

08:01.647 --> 08:05.275
Yeah. I know you haven't seen him,
Keel. Nobody has.

08:05.442 --> 08:08.779
All right, well, if you talk to Garth,
just have him call in.

08:08.988 --> 08:12.449
- Yeah.
- Garth still MIA?

08:13.617 --> 08:15.035
Yeah.

08:15.452 --> 08:18.956
How about the other prophets in line?
I mean, if Kevin is, uh...

08:20.249 --> 08:24.003
Is dead, then won't one of them
be activated?

08:24.211 --> 08:26.213
Nothing. No, not a peep.

08:28.882 --> 08:33.846
Here we are, no lead, no tablet, squat.

08:35.556 --> 08:38.933
Well, I mean, we got all this.

08:41.061 --> 08:42.604
We should have moved him here.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.998
I guess I've been acquiring the taste.

09:01.206 --> 09:03.584
Yeah, the coffee's not too bad here.

09:05.335 --> 09:08.630
You know, I remember
when you first discovered it.

09:08.839 --> 09:12.593
Before you started brewing it,
you'd just chew the berries.

09:12.801 --> 09:16.096
Folktale is true, by the way.
You learned it from the goats.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.809
Been on the road a long time, huh?

09:21.810 --> 09:24.730
Feels like I've been on the run forever.

09:27.441 --> 09:31.653
Um, I'm sorry, mister, but you're gonna
have to order more than coffee...

09:31.862 --> 09:34.948
- ...if you wanna keep the table.
- Of... Of course. Um...

09:36.950 --> 09:39.578
I'll have the smart-heart
beer-battered tempura tempters.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.498
Of course. Coming right up.

09:49.838 --> 09:51.632
They're getting closer.

09:51.840 --> 09:53.133
What's that, chief?

09:58.055 --> 10:02.101
I swear to God, Lance,
the guy just disappeared.

10:10.192 --> 10:11.777
You on the crack again, Perry?

10:16.740 --> 10:18.992
Ion, tell me that you have good news.

10:19.368 --> 10:23.831
He's using a clever tactic.
It's a restaurant called Biggerson's.

10:24.414 --> 10:27.835
Humans have built hundreds
almost exactly alike.

10:28.043 --> 10:31.380
- What are you talking about?
- It's their sameness.

10:32.172 --> 10:34.675
Castiel is using it against us.

10:34.842 --> 10:37.719
We try to orient ourselves, but it's
as if we're in every Biggerson's...

10:37.886 --> 10:40.139
...trapped in a quantum superposition.

10:40.305 --> 10:44.893
Now, he chooses which to go to next,
that's what's giving him the edge.

10:45.060 --> 10:47.146
You're saying that you can't catch him?

10:47.938 --> 10:51.650
There's just so many Biggerson's.

10:52.901 --> 10:54.027
Very well.

10:54.903 --> 10:57.072
You say he can't be caught.

10:59.241 --> 11:03.412
Then we will simply
have to make him stop.

11:07.374 --> 11:08.750
Hm.

11:12.254 --> 11:13.964
- There it is again, every time.
- Hm?

11:15.007 --> 11:17.926
This symbol, I know it.

11:18.093 --> 11:20.596
Now, Kevin has it down
as sort of like a signature...

11:20.804 --> 11:22.014
...for the scribe of God.

11:22.222 --> 11:25.684
It appears every time Metatron
makes one of his, uh, like, editor's notes.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.477
Okay.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.730
But I think I've seen it before.

11:29.938 --> 11:30.981
It was a long time ago.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.776
It was one of my, uh,
humanities courses at Stanford.

11:37.404 --> 11:40.866
They taught word of God at Stanford?

11:41.074 --> 11:44.161
No, uh, it was an overview
of Native American art.

11:44.369 --> 11:45.621
I think it's a petroglyph.

11:46.580 --> 11:47.915
A petro-what-now?

11:48.498 --> 11:51.877
This one belonged to a tiny tribe
in Colorado. More of a clan, really.

11:52.044 --> 11:55.005
It says here they held onto
their scrap of mountains...

11:55.214 --> 11:57.549
...when all the other tribes
fell to the white man.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.927
So this glyph was a territorial marker.

12:00.135 --> 12:03.931
Closest translation, "Messenger of God."

12:09.853 --> 12:11.688
Messenger of God.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.858
Messenger of God.
Dean, we have to go there.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.027
On that hunch? You can barely function.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.571
I'm only gonna get worse.

12:19.780 --> 12:23.617
I mean, until I get back to the real job,
until we find the third trial.

12:23.784 --> 12:26.536
We're out of prophets. We're not gonna
figure out what Kevin couldn't.

12:26.745 --> 12:30.374
I say we go to this messenger of God
who wrote it in the first place.

12:30.582 --> 12:32.209
And you think that this Metatron...

12:32.417 --> 12:35.545
...is hiding out in the mountains
with a bunch of Indians?

12:36.213 --> 12:38.048
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

12:40.425 --> 12:44.429
You're not really supposed
to say "Indians," it's...

12:44.972 --> 12:46.598
We should go.

12:49.059 --> 12:50.602
You are delirious.

13:03.198 --> 13:05.117
You have to stop.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.412
They said you have to stop.

13:09.037 --> 13:10.497
No.

13:10.706 --> 13:14.251
- They said you have to stop.
- No.

13:15.627 --> 13:17.045
...To stop.

13:21.216 --> 13:23.051
You have to stop.

13:24.428 --> 13:26.513
- No.
- You have to stop.

13:27.973 --> 13:31.018
They said you have to stop.

13:33.687 --> 13:36.023
You have to stop.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.749
Nice place.

14:10.891 --> 14:12.934
Morning. Hi.

14:13.935 --> 14:15.645
Uh, we'd like a room.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.444
Here, please.

14:39.961 --> 14:41.088
Did you hear that?

14:43.173 --> 14:44.800
Hear what?

14:48.804 --> 14:50.138
He has the flu.

14:56.478 --> 14:58.480
You have to stop.

14:59.147 --> 15:01.983
You have to stop. They said...

15:02.150 --> 15:03.652
Aah!

15:04.861 --> 15:07.697
Ah. Can't hear myself think.

15:07.906 --> 15:11.243
We were supposed to be their shepherds,
not their murderers.

15:11.451 --> 15:13.662
Not always, angel.

15:14.830 --> 15:18.792
There was that day back in Egypt
not so long ago...

15:19.000 --> 15:21.670
...where we slew every firstborn infant...

15:21.837 --> 15:24.714
...whose door wasn't splashed
with lamb's blood.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.759
And that was just PR.

15:28.343 --> 15:29.803
Well, I wasn't there.

15:30.470 --> 15:33.682
Oh, you were there.

15:33.849 --> 15:36.143
You just don't remember it.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.353
How...?

15:38.812 --> 15:43.525
How many times have you torn
into my head and washed it clean?

15:44.359 --> 15:46.695
Frankly, too damn many.

15:52.868 --> 15:55.829
You're the famous spanner in the works.

15:55.996 --> 15:59.207
Honestly, I think you came off the line
with a crack in your chassis.

15:59.875 --> 16:02.669
You have never done
what you were told...

16:03.503 --> 16:05.380
...not completely.

16:05.964 --> 16:08.508
You don't even die right, do you?

16:08.717 --> 16:12.471
Where is the angel tablet, Castiel?

16:13.972 --> 16:17.309
In the words of a good friend...

16:18.643 --> 16:20.479
...bite me.

16:22.230 --> 16:25.901
Oh, we'll bite. Don't worry.

16:27.652 --> 16:31.781
Go. Search all these Biggerson's.

16:34.201 --> 16:36.328
He must have hidden it along the way.

16:48.215 --> 16:49.716
I can barely see.

16:52.594 --> 16:53.762
I need food.

16:57.724 --> 17:00.227
All right.
"Barbecue ribs, mashed potatoes..."

17:00.435 --> 17:01.811
Garlic mashed potatoes.

17:02.437 --> 17:05.607
"Garlic mashed potatoes,
mixed greens with baby lettuce...

17:05.815 --> 17:09.569
...cornbread and, uh, pad thai."

17:10.278 --> 17:13.573
Garth says there's a good little place
on the other side of town.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.953
What the hell? Kid's been working hard.

17:28.128 --> 17:32.634
- Those guys aren't half bad.
- No, sir. You chose well.

17:32.842 --> 17:36.638
Of course, if I wasn't running everything,
I could have played Dean myself.

17:36.846 --> 17:39.307
Oh, you would have made
a great Dean, sir.

17:50.402 --> 17:55.282
Regular tourist mecca we got here.
We're the only guests in this whole place.

17:55.490 --> 17:58.785
Last entry in the registry
was in '06.

17:59.452 --> 18:01.997
Hey, you remember when, uh...

18:02.163 --> 18:05.083
When dad took us to the bottom
of the Grand Canyon...

18:05.292 --> 18:06.501
...on that pack-mule ride?

18:07.002 --> 18:09.671
- The what?
- And your, uh...

18:10.422 --> 18:13.091
Your mule kept farting...

18:13.300 --> 18:18.513
...just letting go, like gale force.

18:19.472 --> 18:21.683
Dude, you were like 4 years old.
I barely remember that.

18:24.185 --> 18:26.896
Ah... You rode a farty donkey.

18:27.272 --> 18:31.276
Okay. Uh, I'm gonna go check out
the Two Rivers Travel Museum...

18:31.484 --> 18:32.527
...and Trading Post.

18:32.694 --> 18:36.489
Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna, um...

18:36.656 --> 18:40.118
I'm gonna follow the hotel manager,
Dr. Scowley-Scowl.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.621
He's like a villain from Scooby-Doo.

18:42.829 --> 18:48.043
No, hey, uh, Little Big Man,
you should get some rest.

18:49.044 --> 18:50.337
Yeah, I can do that too.

18:53.423 --> 18:57.719
The people of the Two Rivers tribe
came to this land centuries ago...

18:57.927 --> 19:00.055
...a land that was harsh and stony.

19:01.431 --> 19:05.018
But their mighty leader
told his people that they must stay here.

19:05.226 --> 19:07.354
He claimed that this
was the home on Earth...

19:07.562 --> 19:09.648
...of the Great Spirit's
sacred messenger...

19:09.856 --> 19:13.026
...and that if they made offerings,
their blessings would be many.

19:13.234 --> 19:15.570
- What were the offerings?
- Huh?

19:15.737 --> 19:19.741
Uh, what did the Great Spirit's
sacred messenger ask for?

19:19.949 --> 19:21.034
Stories.

19:23.244 --> 19:26.039
He asked the people to tell him stories.

19:32.087 --> 19:34.506
I bet I know what the blessings were.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.175
Sam?

21:04.429 --> 21:07.015
I've been all over them. It's not there.

21:09.309 --> 21:13.354
Why? Why are you doing this?

21:14.272 --> 21:17.317
Let us put the tablet back
where it should be.

21:18.693 --> 21:22.071
- I need to protect it.
- From the angels?

21:23.364 --> 21:25.074
From all of us.

21:28.161 --> 21:31.372
I'm just going to have to pull you apart,
aren't I?

21:43.885 --> 21:45.720
Naomi, darling.

21:47.972 --> 21:49.557
Miss me?

22:02.278 --> 22:04.781
- Get off. What the hell?
- Take it easy, Sam.

22:04.989 --> 22:06.032
Aah!

22:06.241 --> 22:08.409
Hey. Whoa, whoa. Take it easy. Take it...

22:08.576 --> 22:10.245
Ah.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.455
Found you on the floor, passed out.

22:12.664 --> 22:15.959
Your temperature was 107.
I had to force it down, or you were toast.

22:16.167 --> 22:18.044
He's here, Dean.

22:18.586 --> 22:21.422
Metatron is here.
I know it. I can hear him.

22:22.006 --> 22:24.175
- What are you talking about?
- All I know...

22:24.801 --> 22:26.636
...is that I'm connected to it somehow.

22:27.011 --> 22:29.180
What, like you got a link to him,
like a prophet?

22:29.389 --> 22:30.765
I don't know.

22:31.307 --> 22:33.518
I just know he's here. Metatron is here.

22:34.227 --> 22:35.687
Okay. Here where?

22:37.605 --> 22:38.648
I can show you.

22:40.358 --> 22:41.860
I can show you. The manager...

22:42.068 --> 22:43.653
...he was delivering books to him.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.363
- Books?
- Books.

22:45.864 --> 22:49.158
Hardcovers, paperbacks, novels, books.

22:50.076 --> 22:51.494
Stories.

22:54.205 --> 22:55.248
Do you like it?

22:55.665 --> 22:59.502
I had my R&D people melt down
one of your angel blades...

22:59.711 --> 23:01.379
...cast it into bullets.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.423
Seems to do the trick.

23:03.631 --> 23:04.799
How dare you.

23:05.174 --> 23:08.887
I am the daringest devil
you've ever met, love.

23:13.516 --> 23:15.184
We've been here before, haven't we?

23:17.145 --> 23:18.855
Let's see who blinks first.

23:25.987 --> 23:27.322
Hm.

23:35.997 --> 23:37.040
Hi, Cass.

23:41.127 --> 23:42.462
That's right, Cass.

23:43.046 --> 23:45.131
I got me an angel on the payroll.

23:47.425 --> 23:51.262
It's that kind of universe these days. Heh.

23:58.394 --> 24:02.982
Now grab him and follow me.

24:05.568 --> 24:06.945
Hey, kid, you okay?

24:07.153 --> 24:10.323
I can't, all right?
It's the break in the stone.

24:10.531 --> 24:12.659
There's key writing. I can't make it out.

24:14.494 --> 24:15.536
You guys were right.

24:15.745 --> 24:18.623
I do need the other half of the tablet
to get the trial.

24:18.831 --> 24:20.208
It's not too far from here.

24:23.086 --> 24:26.673
Awesome. Uh... Well, what's the 10-20?

24:27.465 --> 24:33.721
Just wanted to take a moment away
from the main action, ha...

24:35.974 --> 24:40.645
...to chat with my old business partner.

24:41.229 --> 24:43.606
I assume you won't die just yet.

24:43.815 --> 24:46.442
Takes a painful long time to bleed out
from the gut.

24:47.652 --> 24:50.113
You can do whatever you want, Crowley.

24:50.321 --> 24:53.908
I will never tell you
where I buried the tablet.

24:55.076 --> 24:58.246
I know, Cass. I know.

24:58.746 --> 25:00.331
Luckily...

25:01.040 --> 25:03.292
...I don't believe you have to.

25:03.459 --> 25:08.423
I've been getting regular updates
from my expensive friend here.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.758
Naomi should have caught you...

25:10.967 --> 25:13.928
...seeing as lately, she's been
knuckles deep in that melon of yours.

25:14.637 --> 25:20.977
She thinks that your touching the tablet
has broken her spell over you. Mm?

25:21.894 --> 25:27.692
The tablets weren't meant for the angels
and they weren't meant for you.

25:28.651 --> 25:33.156
She's got a lot on her plate,
so you can't fault her for missing it.

25:33.322 --> 25:35.450
I was thinking to myself, "Self...

25:35.658 --> 25:39.746
...if Cass got away from her
by touching the tablet...

25:39.954 --> 25:43.249
...why would he ever stop
touching the tablet?"

25:44.000 --> 25:45.460
And then I thought to myself:

25:46.335 --> 25:47.920
"Self...

25:48.629 --> 25:51.382
...he hasn't stopped touching the tablet,
now, has he?"

26:18.868 --> 26:22.288
Oh, you're a pip, you are. Heh-heh.

26:24.540 --> 26:26.000
What?

26:32.256 --> 26:33.382
This is the king.

26:33.591 --> 26:36.219
The kid told us where the other half was,
but it wasn't.

26:38.846 --> 26:40.723
Dab of crap tricked us...

26:40.932 --> 26:44.685
...sent us into
some kind of hunter mousetrap.

26:45.228 --> 26:48.064
You jackasses. You're ruining my streak.

26:50.024 --> 26:51.526
Watch him.

26:53.861 --> 26:55.279
I'll be right back.

26:57.198 --> 26:58.825
I should be taking you to the ER.

26:59.033 --> 27:01.202
They can't do anything for me.

27:01.410 --> 27:04.747
You know,
I've been remembering things...

27:04.956 --> 27:06.415
...little things, so clearly...

27:06.624 --> 27:07.667
What, donkey rides?

27:07.875 --> 27:10.545
You used to read to me,
um, when I was little.

27:10.753 --> 27:13.714
I mean, really little, from that old, uh...

27:13.923 --> 27:16.425
...Classics illustrated comic book.
You remember that?

27:16.634 --> 27:17.802
No.

27:18.010 --> 27:19.428
Knights of the Round Table.

27:19.637 --> 27:22.723
King Arthur's knights
were all on the quest for the Holy Grail.

27:22.932 --> 27:25.685
And I remember looking
at this picture of Sir Galahad...

27:25.893 --> 27:28.187
...and he was kneeling...

27:29.480 --> 27:31.315
...and light streaming over his face.

27:31.482 --> 27:37.280
And I remember thinking, uh...

27:38.447 --> 27:40.575
...I could never go on a quest like that...

27:43.161 --> 27:47.039
...because I'm not clean.

27:49.167 --> 27:52.086
I mean, I was just a little kid.

27:55.047 --> 27:58.467
You think maybe I knew?

27:59.218 --> 28:01.429
I mean, deep down that...

28:02.471 --> 28:06.601
...I had demon blood in me...

28:06.767 --> 28:08.644
...and about the evil of it...

28:09.187 --> 28:14.567
...and that I wasn't pure?

28:15.776 --> 28:17.737
Sam, it's not your fault.

28:17.945 --> 28:23.117
It doesn't matter anymore,
because these trials...

28:26.078 --> 28:28.122
...they're purifying me.

28:38.758 --> 28:42.220
They were here, the books, the boxes.

28:43.095 --> 28:44.597
They're gone.

29:28.307 --> 29:29.558
Who are you?

29:31.143 --> 29:32.520
Metatron?

29:34.313 --> 29:36.565
This is Metatron? This is Metatron?

29:37.358 --> 29:39.360
Sit down.

29:51.664 --> 29:55.459
- Who sent you?
- We came on our own.

29:55.668 --> 29:57.378
We're the Winchesters.

29:57.628 --> 29:59.088
I'm Dean, this is Sam.

29:59.797 --> 30:02.842
You work for Michael? Or Lucifer?

30:06.095 --> 30:07.888
What, you really haven't heard of us?

30:09.598 --> 30:13.144
What kind of angel are you?
We're the frigging Winchesters.

30:22.611 --> 30:24.155
How far can this go?

30:24.322 --> 30:26.407
Shut up.

30:28.242 --> 30:29.243
Ion.

30:29.493 --> 30:32.330
How far can we let it all drop?

30:32.538 --> 30:35.916
This charge was left to us.
It's our mission.

30:36.167 --> 30:39.670
Do you even know
what the mission was?

30:41.422 --> 30:45.259
They've been in all our heads.

30:46.927 --> 30:52.183
We aren't machines
for them to program and reprogram.

30:52.391 --> 30:54.435
That wasn't what this was meant to be.

30:55.770 --> 30:57.938
Nothing matters.

30:59.774 --> 31:02.360
You are so wrong, brother.

31:07.448 --> 31:09.241
It all matters.

31:27.593 --> 31:29.428
You little prat.

31:31.722 --> 31:33.057
You having fun yet?

31:36.644 --> 31:37.686
Screw you.

31:38.896 --> 31:40.314
Am I seeing this?

31:42.942 --> 31:44.485
How'd you figure it out?

31:45.319 --> 31:47.488
It started when they forgot
the secret knock.

31:48.572 --> 31:50.908
But really, it was the way they acted.

31:51.075 --> 31:53.744
I don't think on their best day
Sam and Dean would go into town...

31:53.911 --> 31:55.955
...and get me a barbecue dinner...

31:56.163 --> 31:59.333
...not when there are leftover burritos
in the fridge.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.585
So...

32:02.837 --> 32:05.714
...my demons were too polite?

32:07.508 --> 32:08.801
Yeah.

32:09.677 --> 32:12.012
Well, I'll be a son of a whore.

32:13.472 --> 32:17.351
Michael and Lucifer,
those dudes are in the deep fryer.

32:17.518 --> 32:19.270
Yeah. We put them there ourselves.

32:20.604 --> 32:23.190
What about Gabriel and Raphael?

32:23.649 --> 32:24.775
Dead.

32:24.984 --> 32:26.277
You really don't know this?

32:27.611 --> 32:30.364
- I've been very careful.
- Hey, can you...?

32:31.740 --> 32:32.950
Can you turn that down?

32:33.159 --> 32:35.035
Turn what down?

32:36.412 --> 32:37.955
Oh.

32:38.998 --> 32:42.877
- You're resonating.
- Resonating? What do you mean?

32:43.377 --> 32:45.129
You've undertaken the trials.

32:46.338 --> 32:48.883
You're trying to pull
one of the great levers, aren't you?

32:50.551 --> 32:52.052
You're pretty far along too.

32:52.970 --> 32:55.973
You get that far along,
you start resonating with the word.

32:56.974 --> 32:59.018
Or with its source on the material plane.

33:01.020 --> 33:02.188
With me.

33:03.147 --> 33:05.232
You said you were being careful.
Careful how?

33:05.858 --> 33:08.986
I'm not one of them.
I'm not an archangel.

33:09.528 --> 33:11.780
Really more run-of-the-mill.

33:11.989 --> 33:16.911
I worked in the secretarial pool before God
chose me to take down the word.

33:18.078 --> 33:22.208
Anyway, he seemed very worried
about his work...

33:22.416 --> 33:25.085
...what would happen to it when he left...

33:25.294 --> 33:27.880
...so he had me write down instructions.

33:28.714 --> 33:31.800
Then he was gone.

33:33.761 --> 33:35.846
After that...

33:37.431 --> 33:39.934
...the archangels took over.

33:41.060 --> 33:44.605
They cried and they wailed.

33:44.855 --> 33:48.734
They wanted their father back.
I mean, we all did.

33:49.443 --> 33:53.614
But then... Then they started to scheme.

33:54.198 --> 33:57.826
The archangels decided
if they couldn't have Dad...

33:58.035 --> 34:00.287
...they'd take over the universe
themselves.

34:01.497 --> 34:06.293
But they couldn't do anything that big
without the word of God.

34:07.211 --> 34:10.339
So I began to realize...

34:10.547 --> 34:14.051
...maybe they would realize...

34:14.635 --> 34:17.221
...they needed me.

34:17.804 --> 34:22.976
So you get a ruffle in your feathers
and just decide to disappear...

34:23.226 --> 34:25.478
...go stick your head in the sand forever?

34:27.481 --> 34:30.109
You have no idea
what's been going on out there?

34:30.317 --> 34:32.110
Nope.

34:33.571 --> 34:34.989
That's the whole point.

34:35.155 --> 34:41.120
You soldiers down in the garrison,
at least they let you believe the lie.

34:41.328 --> 34:44.456
Upstairs, working for Naomi,
working in Intelligence...

34:44.665 --> 34:47.626
...we had no option but
to live in the dirt.

34:48.168 --> 34:52.880
She never reset me completely.
I always knew too much. I had to...

34:53.172 --> 34:55.342
- I had to do my job.
- Ion.

34:56.510 --> 34:58.012
Shut up.

35:07.187 --> 35:11.108
So you've been holed up here,
or in a wigwam...

35:11.317 --> 35:15.362
...or before that in some cave,
listening to stories, reading books?

35:17.031 --> 35:19.825
And it was something to watch.

35:20.618 --> 35:23.996
What you brought to his Earth...

35:24.204 --> 35:28.292
...all the mayhem, the murder...

35:28.459 --> 35:34.381
...just the raw, wild invention
of God's naked apes...

35:35.549 --> 35:36.925
...it was mind-blowing.

35:38.218 --> 35:44.224
But really...
Really, it was your storytelling.

35:44.850 --> 35:50.481
That is the true flower of free will.

35:50.689 --> 35:53.901
At least, as you've mastered it so far.

35:54.485 --> 35:58.781
When you create stories,
you become gods...

35:58.947 --> 36:03.744
...of tiny, intricate dimensions
unto themselves.

36:04.244 --> 36:06.747
So many worlds.

36:06.997 --> 36:12.836
I have read as much as it's possible
for an angel to read...

36:13.045 --> 36:14.296
...and I haven't caught up.

36:15.881 --> 36:17.424
You know what?

36:19.677 --> 36:20.928
Pull the frigging trigger.

36:23.472 --> 36:24.515
What?

36:24.723 --> 36:27.101
- Pull the frigging trigger...
- Sam.

36:27.267 --> 36:29.186
- ...you cowardly piece of garbage.
- Hey.

36:29.395 --> 36:31.605
All the time you've been hiding here...

36:31.772 --> 36:33.982
...how much suffering
have you read over?

36:34.191 --> 36:35.275
Humanity's suffering.

36:36.110 --> 36:38.779
And how much of it
has been at the hands of your kind?

36:39.363 --> 36:41.198
Hey, hey.

36:41.907 --> 36:42.950
You want a story?

36:43.784 --> 36:46.912
Try Kevin Tran's story.

36:47.121 --> 36:48.288
He was just a kid.

36:48.455 --> 36:51.125
He was a good straight-A kid,
and then he got sucked in...

36:51.291 --> 36:53.627
...to all of this angel crap...

36:53.794 --> 36:58.257
...and became a prophet
of the word of God, your prophet.

36:59.842 --> 37:01.760
You should've been
looking out for him, but no...

37:01.927 --> 37:04.972
...instead you're here holed up
reading books.

37:07.766 --> 37:11.520
He's dead now, because of you.

37:17.443 --> 37:19.653
You know the Winchesters
are up to the third trial?

37:21.905 --> 37:23.532
That they're gonna
shut the door on hell?

37:24.658 --> 37:26.452
I'm not worried, kid.

37:31.081 --> 37:33.751
You have no idea
what's on this demon tablet.

37:35.252 --> 37:38.589
The power you could've gotten with this,
if you weren't running around...

37:38.756 --> 37:42.968
- ...like a chicken with his head cut off.
- You think I can't make you tell?

37:45.012 --> 37:47.973
I know you can't,
and you do too.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.143
You know what?

37:51.351 --> 37:53.437
I've already won.

37:54.521 --> 37:58.150
I have the angel tablet, you little smudge.

38:00.986 --> 38:03.947
And I got deals and plans up the jacksie.

38:04.156 --> 38:05.365
And I don't...

38:05.866 --> 38:07.951
...need...

38:08.160 --> 38:09.203
...you.

38:53.539 --> 38:55.999
Is that it? Is he good?

38:57.084 --> 38:59.294
Give him a minute.

39:08.387 --> 39:11.223
How did you get past
Crowley's angel warding?

39:11.431 --> 39:14.268
I'm the scribe of God. I erased it.

39:14.601 --> 39:17.354
But you saw, right? I mean...

39:17.563 --> 39:19.815
...you're caught up on everything
that's been going on?

39:19.982 --> 39:24.027
On the crap that your brethren's
been doing to humanity all this time?

39:24.736 --> 39:26.822
I saved the boy, didn't I?

39:27.197 --> 39:28.907
But are you in?

39:29.116 --> 39:30.200
With us, I mean.

39:31.869 --> 39:34.830
You really intend on closing
the doors of hell?

39:37.624 --> 39:39.376
Seems like the thing to do, don't it?

39:41.003 --> 39:42.796
It's your choice.

39:43.297 --> 39:45.382
And that's what this has all been about...

39:45.591 --> 39:48.302
...the choices your kind make.

39:49.845 --> 39:51.930
But you're gonna have to weigh that choice.

39:52.848 --> 39:56.560
Ask yourself,
what is it going to take to do this?

39:57.019 --> 40:00.147
And what will the world be like
after it's done?

40:02.316 --> 40:04.860
Dean? Dean!

40:11.617 --> 40:12.951
Kevin?

40:14.036 --> 40:15.829
Hey.

40:18.832 --> 40:20.584
We thought we lost you, kiddo.

40:22.419 --> 40:24.004
I'm good.

40:25.130 --> 40:29.092
Second half of the tablet. And I got it.

40:30.218 --> 40:31.261
Third trial.

40:34.306 --> 40:35.849
I didn't tell Crowley.

40:38.644 --> 40:41.521
- So, what is it?
- To cure a demon.

40:48.278 --> 40:49.321
Yeah.

40:52.574 --> 40:54.034
Who are you?

40:59.998 --> 41:01.541
Cure a demon?

41:02.084 --> 41:05.087
Ignoring the fact that I have no idea
what that actually means...

41:05.253 --> 41:07.130
...if we do this, you get better, right?

41:07.297 --> 41:11.927
I mean, you'll stop trying to cough up
a lung and bumping into furniture?

41:13.387 --> 41:18.141
I feel better, yeah, um,
just having a direction to move in.

41:18.684 --> 41:21.395
Good, because where we're headed
doesn't sound like a picnic.

41:23.355 --> 41:25.482
But we're heading somewhere.

41:26.566 --> 41:28.318
The end.

41:39.955 --> 41:41.123
Cass?

41:43.333 --> 41:45.002
A little help here.
