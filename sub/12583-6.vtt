WEBVTT

00:38.413 --> 00:40.498
The worst part of going on vacation

00:40.582 --> 00:43.001
is the look on her face
when we head out the door.

00:43.084 --> 00:45.211
Are we talking about Ladybird or Peggy?

00:45.295 --> 00:47.756
-
Whoa, down girl.

00:49.007 --> 00:49.841
Hi, guys.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.428
Meet my new friend, Buster.

00:53.511 --> 00:54.929
Say hello, Buster.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.933
Pretty dog. Weak handshake.

00:59.017 --> 01:01.352
-Buster, play.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.731
Boy, Bill, that is a magnificent animal.

01:04.814 --> 01:07.400
Yeah, I got him through
a new military program

01:07.484 --> 01:10.779
where you adopt the pet of a GI
while he's on his tour of duty.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.573
Well, all right.
That's a great way to serve our country.

01:13.656 --> 01:16.659
Supporting our enlisted men,
one dog at a time.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.953
Hey, I was just gonna take Ladybird
up to the lake.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.288
You and Buster wanna come along?

01:20.371 --> 01:24.292
Sorry, Buster does his community service
at the VFW today.

01:24.501 --> 01:25.668
Some of those old guys

01:25.752 --> 01:27.670
haven't felt a tongue
on their face for years.

01:27.754 --> 01:28.713
Here, boy.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.216
Hey, Bill, can civilians get in on this,

01:31.299 --> 01:33.468
or is it just a perk for the Armed Forces?

01:33.551 --> 01:34.677
Anyone can do it.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.763
All you have to do is take a pledge

01:36.846 --> 01:39.682
to "perform all functions
necessary and possible

01:39.766 --> 01:41.392
for the animal's well-being."

01:41.476 --> 01:43.353
A pledge?

01:43.436 --> 01:47.398
Okay. Now, we start here
two weeks from today.

01:47.482 --> 01:50.819
We drive 400 miles
and catch a riverboat tour

01:50.902 --> 01:52.529
up the mighty Mississip.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.115
Then it is on to Graceland in Memphis,

01:55.198 --> 01:58.535
and then to the Cowboys/Titans game
in Nashville.

01:58.618 --> 02:02.539
And on the way back, we get to stop
at Willis' Famous Barbecue

02:02.622 --> 02:05.125
where the ribs fall off the bone
or your money back.

02:05.208 --> 02:08.086
Now, Bobby, Memphis to Nashville,

02:08.169 --> 02:10.338
that's a long stretch without a rest stop.

02:10.421 --> 02:13.758
I'm already training.
I've had four glasses of water today.

02:13.842 --> 02:17.262
It's been two hours and nine minutes,
and I feel fine.

02:17.345 --> 02:19.264
Peggy. Bobby. Great news.

02:19.347 --> 02:23.017
We can adopt the dog of a GI
while he's on his tour of duty.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.687
I... I don't know, Hank. Another dog?

02:25.770 --> 02:28.356
Not just any dog, the dog of a soldier.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.692
Come on, think about our patriotic duty.

02:30.775 --> 02:32.443
I'll take care of it, I promise.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.571
I'll do everything.
You won't even know it's here.

02:34.654 --> 02:37.031
We are going on vacation in two weeks.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.242
We're gonna have to board Ladybird
as it is...

02:39.325 --> 02:40.160
Don't worry.

02:40.243 --> 02:44.122
I told the military we can't take the dog
until after we get back from our trip.

02:44.205 --> 02:48.459
Well, as long as it doesn't interfere
with the vacation, I suppose it's...

02:48.543 --> 02:49.586
All right.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.173
It's nice to see him so happy.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.509
A coozie?

02:56.593 --> 02:58.845
Since when are you so fancy
all of a sudden?

02:58.928 --> 03:00.847
You too good for us now?

03:01.514 --> 03:02.515
Hey, guys.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.768
You are looking at a guy
who has just been approved

03:05.852 --> 03:08.271
for the GI Foster Pet Program.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.439
-Yay!
-Way to go, man.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.399
Do you know what kind of dog
you're getting?

03:11.482 --> 03:13.318
No, but his name's Duke.

03:13.401 --> 03:16.946
You tell me a dog named Duke
won't take a bullet for you.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.203
This is so amazing.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.495
He knew it was empty.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.460
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.797
We don't have to go through Oklahoma.

03:36.841 --> 03:37.675
Hill residence.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.761
<i>This is Army Sergeant Williamson.</i>

03:39.844 --> 03:41.763
<i>We're going to need you
to take possession of Duke</i>

03:41.846 --> 03:44.474
<i>between 0900 and 0915 tomorrow morning.</i>

03:44.557 --> 03:48.353
What? But I thought I made it very clear
that we didn't want Duke

03:48.436 --> 03:50.813
until after we got back from our vacation.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.441
<i>Patriotism doesn't take a vacation, sir.</i>

03:55.902 --> 03:59.280
This is the smallest bottle of Prell
that I have ever seen.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.823
Check out the lotion.

04:01.282 --> 04:03.243
Dang it. I just used it all.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.829
I got a call from the Armed Forces...

04:06.913 --> 04:10.041
Duke is coming a little earlier
than expected.

04:10.124 --> 04:11.793
Uh, like tomorrow.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.711
But we're leaving in less than a week.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.047
You just call them back
and tell them it's too early.

04:16.130 --> 04:17.048
Don't worry.

04:17.131 --> 04:20.551
I talked to the guy who owns the farm
where Ladybird is gonna stay,

04:20.635 --> 04:23.221
and he says another dog
would be no problem.

04:23.888 --> 04:26.432
Why do we need toilet seat covers?

04:26.516 --> 04:28.309
One word. Tennessee.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.439
They'll be here any second.

04:33.648 --> 04:34.857
Is everybody ready?

04:35.191 --> 04:36.859
You're, uh... You're wearing that?

04:36.943 --> 04:39.279
Dog, Hank. It's a dog.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.446
Car.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.993
Hey, Bill. My dog
is about to be delivered.

04:45.076 --> 04:48.705
That's great.
I just got a gift basket from my GI.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.249
Get this: He's a Blue Angel.

04:51.332 --> 04:55.628
He's the one that made France mad
by flying under the Eiffel Tower.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.757
Oh, my God, they're here.

05:12.061 --> 05:13.146
Morning, Mr. Hill.

05:13.896 --> 05:16.733
On behalf of the Armed Forces,
thank you for your generosity.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.985
I present to you... Duke.

05:22.530 --> 05:23.406
Come here, boy.

05:36.544 --> 05:38.755
That's a dang ol' thing, isn't it?

05:40.506 --> 05:41.341
Uh, Hank,

05:41.424 --> 05:43.593
looks like that cat ate your dog.

05:49.098 --> 05:50.600
Uh, about Duke...

05:51.059 --> 05:51.976
he's a cat.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.562
I was supposed to get a dog.
My neighbor got a dog.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.606
Yeah, and I wanted to be an F-18 pilot.

05:56.689 --> 05:59.150
One psych exam later,
I'm delivering you a cat.

06:00.526 --> 06:01.611
Uh, oh, wait.

06:01.694 --> 06:04.697
I already have a dog.
So a cat would be in danger.

06:04.781 --> 06:07.492
That would be treason, right?

06:08.201 --> 06:10.286
Sir, is this your signature here, sir?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.371
Yes.

06:11.454 --> 06:12.872
And is this your two page addendum

06:12.955 --> 06:16.000
stating how it would be your honor
to fulfill your patriotic duty?

06:16.084 --> 06:17.877
I believe you quoted
"The Star-Spangled Banner"

06:17.960 --> 06:18.795
in its entirety.

06:23.633 --> 06:24.759
Huh...

06:28.721 --> 06:29.931
Dad!

06:30.640 --> 06:31.933
Cat?

06:35.436 --> 06:37.814
Okay, this won't be so bad.

06:37.897 --> 06:41.692
I bet while we're gone, we can board Duke
for just a few more dollars a day.

06:41.776 --> 06:45.696
Lovely. And in the meantime,
where are we going to keep this?

06:45.780 --> 06:49.283
Well, Private Hennessey
left us an information dossier

06:49.367 --> 06:51.411
we're supposed to follow.
Let's see what he says.

06:51.494 --> 06:52.954
Mom, look out.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.288
Ohh...

06:56.249 --> 06:57.166
Yep.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.292
Yup.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.585
Mm-hmm.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.968
Hank, looks like the cat
is out of the bag.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.137
Oh...

07:09.220 --> 07:11.514
this has been a cat-astrophe.

07:12.765 --> 07:16.769
Uh, cat... c... uh...

07:16.853 --> 07:19.772
You got a cat.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.108
So, one of our fighting men has a cat?

07:22.191 --> 07:24.068
-What of it?
-Hey, guys.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.571
Wow, you two are looking good.

07:26.654 --> 07:29.657
I see the perfect fusion
of master and animal.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.577
I can't tell where one ends
and the other begins.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.996
Oh, I feel great.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.498
Good ol' Buster's built my wind up.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.502
Well, that must be Duke. He's...

07:43.254 --> 07:44.547
-cute.
-Dang it, Bill,

07:44.630 --> 07:48.301
why didn't you tell me you could get stuck
with a cat in this program?

07:48.384 --> 07:50.261
Come on, Hank, cats aren't so bad.

07:50.344 --> 07:51.888
One of Buster's best friends

07:51.971 --> 07:56.017
is a cat that does recon missions
with a camera strapped to his back.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.854
I don't think yours does that, though.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.071
Eh, eh...

08:09.155 --> 08:10.740
eh... oh... oh...

08:12.241 --> 08:13.075
Try this.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.244
Once you start playing with it,
you won't want to stop.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.664
Ah, no, thanks.
I just need to get some cat food.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.626
You see, I was recently forced
to take care of a cat,

08:21.709 --> 08:24.837
and I need to know
which one of these I should buy. Quickly.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.464
Oh, all that stuff is garbage.

08:26.547 --> 08:29.675
What your cat needs is this:
Scientific Formula.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.636
Eighteen dollars a bag?

08:31.719 --> 08:33.262
What's wrong with all this other stuff?

08:33.346 --> 08:36.015
Well, between you and me,
it's practically inedible.

08:36.098 --> 08:37.767
We should really be in jail
for carrying it.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.061
All right, fine.

08:40.144 --> 08:42.563
Give me a bag of the Scientific Formula.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.606
Which flavor?

08:43.689 --> 08:45.691
I recommend the Italian herb chicken.

08:45.775 --> 08:46.901
Delicious.

08:52.532 --> 08:56.202
Do you think Private Hennessey enlisted
just to get away from that thing?

08:56.285 --> 08:57.912
Oh, put it out of your mind, Hank.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.039
In a week, we'll be at Graceland.

09:00.414 --> 09:02.833
I wonder if they'll let us shoot
a television.

09:04.669 --> 09:05.878
Oh, Hank.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.922
Bobby, get Duke off the dinner table.

09:08.005 --> 09:10.216
He just threw up,
I don't want to touch him.

09:10.299 --> 09:11.592
Pick him up with a napkin.

09:11.676 --> 09:15.179
Do you want me to take him off the table,
or do you want me to eat my vegetables?

09:15.263 --> 09:16.681
Because I can't do both.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.349
Fine, I'll do it.

09:18.432 --> 09:20.810
Ah. Dang it.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.731
I hope you like the smell
of a cranberry bog,

09:25.815 --> 09:28.693
because it is the only thing
that counteracts the cat stink.

09:28.776 --> 09:31.237
Ugh. Wave some of that stuff over here.

09:32.071 --> 09:35.324
Oh, my God.
The cat has soiled in my shoes.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.577
-Where is he?
-He's in my room.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.121
If I stop petting him, he'll bite me.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.665
I've read that dossier cover-to-cover,

09:42.748 --> 09:46.168
and nowhere in it does it say anything
about pooping in shoes.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.878
You know I hate this cat,

09:47.962 --> 09:50.381
but there might actually be
something wrong with him.

09:50.464 --> 09:52.592
Maybe you should take him to Dr. Yandell.

09:52.675 --> 09:53.676
I can't.

09:53.759 --> 09:54.844
If there are any problems,

09:54.927 --> 09:58.180
I'm supposed to take him to Dr. Leslie
at the Vet Consortium.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.182
That place with the valet parking?

10:00.266 --> 10:02.101
Wait, we're not paying for this, are we?

10:02.184 --> 10:03.769
We have our vacation to think about.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.897
It's like having a bomb
strapped to my lap.

10:07.481 --> 10:09.150
It's part of my commitment.

10:09.233 --> 10:12.737
I can't ask Duke's owner
to take it out of his combat pay.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.822
I've got to go to the bathroom.

10:26.834 --> 10:29.295
I'm Hank Hill. Uh, this is Duke.

10:29.378 --> 10:31.380
We have an appointment with Dr. Leslie.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.257
What's the nature of your cat's problem?

10:33.341 --> 10:35.676
Uh... he's pooping in my shoes.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.845
Okay, go ahead and have a seat.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.723
And we ask that you please
not make eye contact

10:40.806 --> 10:42.224
with Mr. Javier's parrot.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.893
He's got anger issues.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.863
Hello, you must be Duke's caregiver.

10:55.946 --> 10:57.239
I'm Dr. Leslie.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.575
How are you feeling today, Mr. Duke?

10:59.659 --> 11:02.370
Uh, yeah, so, I don't know cats,

11:02.453 --> 11:04.789
so I can't really tell
if anything is wrong.

11:04.872 --> 11:08.209
That's the thing about animals.
They can't tell us what's wrong.

11:08.292 --> 11:11.128
And take it from me,
they can't understand our jokes.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.840
Why don't you gently restrain him

11:14.924 --> 11:17.385
so I can take some blood
and check his vitals?

11:17.510 --> 11:21.347
Uh, yeah, don't you have
a strap or a clamp or something?

11:21.430 --> 11:24.100
If you prefer, you could lay
on the examination table

11:24.183 --> 11:25.935
and hold Duke to your chest.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.314
Mm-hmm.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.317
Very good.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.695
Well, everything seems normal, Mr. Hill.

11:35.778 --> 11:39.615
Oh, great, then I just need you
to sign this Army form stating that, uh,

11:39.699 --> 11:42.535
"Everything within reason has been done

11:42.618 --> 11:45.162
to ensure the proper health
of said animal."

11:45.246 --> 11:47.456
Everything hasn't been done, Mr. Hill.

11:47.540 --> 11:51.127
Sure, Duke "looks" normal
but I did not spend four extra years

11:51.210 --> 11:53.462
specializing in small animal treatment
to just look.

11:53.546 --> 11:58.050
I want to do some more tests on Duke
to make sure we don't miss anything.

11:58.300 --> 12:01.137
EKG, MRI, maybe an iodine trace.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.346
Okay.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.390
First off, we're gonna need to ensure

12:04.473 --> 12:06.225
that Duke has been getting
the proper diet.

12:06.308 --> 12:07.893
Oh, I'm way ahead of you, Doctor.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.521
I already have him
on the Scientific Formula.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.357
You can't feed that to a cat.

12:13.441 --> 12:16.902
Mr. Hill, Duke should only be eating
Vet's Brand.

12:16.986 --> 12:21.157
You're asking me to spend $57
on a bag of cat food?

12:21.240 --> 12:23.784
Well, we can't expect Duke
to buy it on his salary.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.705
Uh, you see? Nothing.

12:27.788 --> 12:31.250
-Okay, that's gonna be $543.
-What?

12:31.333 --> 12:33.002
Bone density test?

12:33.085 --> 12:36.505
Lactose intolerance test? Allergy panel?

12:36.589 --> 12:37.965
I know it sounds a bit pricey,

12:38.048 --> 12:40.009
but these people
have all the best equipment.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.261
Well, almost all the best equipment.

12:42.344 --> 12:44.430
You never stop selling, do you, Tommy?

12:44.513 --> 12:46.515
You're in good hands. I don't have a pet,

12:46.599 --> 12:48.309
but I'd bring my son here,
if they'd let me.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.227
Listen, I can't afford this.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.271
I'm taking my family on vacation.

12:52.354 --> 12:55.232
I'm just doing this because
I made a pledge to the Army.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.734
I don't even like cats.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.041
That's it. Here, boy.

13:15.252 --> 13:17.254
Ah. Dang it.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.381
Okay, droop your eyelids.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.259
Now un-flare that nostril.
That's it. Perfect.

13:22.343 --> 13:25.429
Dad, look at my poker face.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.140
We are gonna take everything
from that riverboat

13:28.224 --> 13:29.141
but the paddle wheel.

13:29.225 --> 13:32.186
Uh, yeah. I'm sorry, you guys,

13:32.269 --> 13:35.564
but Duke's vet visit
just cost us the Riverboat stop.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.732
-What?
-What?

13:36.816 --> 13:39.985
This is no longer a valid TripTik.

13:40.069 --> 13:43.113
I knew it. I knew this whole thing
would blow up in our faces.

13:45.366 --> 13:48.369
Hank, let's just get rid of this cat.
It's ruining our lives.

13:48.452 --> 13:51.455
I can't do that.
It'll be fine, you'll see.

13:51.539 --> 13:56.252
Maybe we won't be able to stay in hotels,
but we can camp... in the car.

14:00.714 --> 14:01.590
Hill residence.

14:01.674 --> 14:02.800
It's Dr. Leslie.

14:02.883 --> 14:06.136
Duke's blood work came back,
and his blood sugar is normal...

14:06.220 --> 14:09.723
no adult-onset diabetes,
no hypertension, no hemophilia.

14:09.807 --> 14:10.891
Oh, that's great.

14:10.975 --> 14:14.520
<i>But we did notice
his white blood cell count is up slightly.</i>

14:14.770 --> 14:15.938
What does that mean?

14:16.021 --> 14:18.649
Could be nothing, could be cancer.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.693
I'm gonna need you to come in
with Duke right away.

14:24.446 --> 14:27.575
I'd like to do a complete physical workup
to cover all our bases.

14:27.658 --> 14:31.704
I also recommend this.
It's what we call a feline mobility cart.

14:31.787 --> 14:33.497
Wait. The cat can't walk?

14:33.581 --> 14:36.083
Of course he can walk.
But rolling is easier.

14:36.166 --> 14:39.253
You see, it may relieve
some pressure and redirect blood flow.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.422
Plus... alloy wheels.

14:41.505 --> 14:44.008
But all this could be for nothing, right?

14:44.091 --> 14:46.760
I mean, Duke may not have
anything wrong with him.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.304
Boy, that'd be great.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.514
-I'd like to go in.
-In?

14:50.598 --> 14:53.601
Do a small exploratory surgery,
rule some things out.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.853
What's that gonna cost me?

14:55.936 --> 14:56.854
Guesstimate?

14:56.937 --> 15:00.065
Between $1,000 and $2,000 and $3,000.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.817
That's a lot of money.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.819
See, my family and I were...

15:04.069 --> 15:06.488
kinda going on this vacation...

15:06.572 --> 15:08.782
Would it kill you not to go on vacation?

15:09.241 --> 15:10.618
Because it may kill Duke.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.914
Do you take traveler's checks?

15:18.334 --> 15:20.669
You and your stupid patriotism.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.588
I'm sure that cat will thank you

15:22.671 --> 15:25.007
for canceling our vacation
by hissing at you.

15:25.090 --> 15:28.218
I expanded my bladder for this trip.

15:28.552 --> 15:29.929
Thanks a lot, Dad.

15:40.856 --> 15:44.401
I can't believe what they want me to do
to get Duke ready for surgery.

15:44.485 --> 15:45.819
To keep him sterile,

15:45.903 --> 15:48.030
I have to put on
these little paper booties

15:48.113 --> 15:50.866
-before he uses the litter box.
-Excuse me.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.078
I believe your dog left this toy
in my yard.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.038
So sorry about that.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.873
He likes pretty ladies.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.500
Oh.

15:59.583 --> 16:00.960
Well, thank you.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.213
Here's my number, in case any more
of his toys go missing.

16:04.505 --> 16:05.381
Dad.

16:05.464 --> 16:09.176
Duke's wheels tracked poo
all over my bedsheets.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.059
Tiptop news, Mr. Hill.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.395
We've eliminated even a remote possibility

16:19.478 --> 16:22.064
that Duke has lung cancer, stomach cancer,

16:22.147 --> 16:23.482
or pancreatic cancer.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.150
Oh, thank God.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.403
So, uh, can you sign the release?

16:27.486 --> 16:30.531
Now we can move on to Duke's
circulatory and skeletal systems.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.828
$150 for a feline enema?

16:35.911 --> 16:37.454
I could do it for half that.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.164
I wish I could let you, Peggy.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.000
Duke is bleeding us dry, Hank.

16:41.083 --> 16:44.586
I think it is time to take him
to our vet for a second opinion. Come on.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.588
You get the crate,
I'll get the oven mitts.

16:49.466 --> 16:51.343
That's a cute little cart you got him in.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.262
Do you have a little mouse
that rides in there, too?

16:53.345 --> 16:58.350
Uh, I swore I would do all that I could
for the care of this cat... in writing.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.020
Well, you've had him tested
from his brain to his behind.

17:01.103 --> 17:04.023
Sounds to me like you have.
You want me to sign that?

17:04.106 --> 17:07.651
Well, thank you, but I need
Duke's vet of choice to do it,

17:07.735 --> 17:09.111
Dr. Bradley Leslie.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.613
Oh, he's topnotch. Best in his field.

17:11.697 --> 17:14.950
Well, I was kinda hoping
you'd tell me he was a quack,

17:15.034 --> 17:16.493
and I wouldn't have to listen to him.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.954
And he's costing me a fortune.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.749
Well, he's got
all those new fancy machines.

17:21.832 --> 17:24.501
And if you've got the machines,
by God, you're gonna use them.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.379
But truth is, sometimes cats just get old.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.214
Duke's going to die someday,

17:29.298 --> 17:31.133
but not of anything he's got right now.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.760
But he keeps vomiting.

17:32.843 --> 17:35.137
Cats vomit. They eat, poop and vomit.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.138
That's what they do.

17:36.221 --> 17:39.516
So you're telling me
I sacrificed my family's vacation

17:39.600 --> 17:42.061
so this guy can pay
for his fancy machines?

17:42.144 --> 17:44.980
Yeah, you wouldn't believe
how much some of 'em go for.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.983
Tommy, how much one of those
ultra-magnetic doohickeys

17:48.067 --> 17:49.568
you keep yammering about set me back?

17:49.651 --> 17:52.071
The Magnetic Ultrasonic Imager 9220?

17:52.154 --> 17:53.322
You don't want to know.

17:53.405 --> 17:54.907
It's so expensive,
no one can make money on it.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.075
We only sold two:

17:56.158 --> 17:58.243
one in Beverly Hills and one in Aspen.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.746
I could have one delivered
within the week.

18:00.829 --> 18:03.499
So, wait. That machine's
even more expensive

18:03.582 --> 18:05.334
than the ones Dr. Leslie has?

18:05.417 --> 18:08.504
Oh, yeah. He's got a 9210.
That's a solid unit.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.422
But this baby's seven percent
more accurate,

18:10.506 --> 18:11.632
and it comes in chrome.

18:11.715 --> 18:13.675
Can I have some of those brochures?

18:13.759 --> 18:17.596
Uh, just take one, though.
They're also really expensive.

18:27.815 --> 18:28.857
Mr. Hill.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.276
Teresa didn't tell me
you had an appointment.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.196
I don't. Look,
I just stopped by to tell you

18:34.279 --> 18:36.323
there will be no more surgeries

18:36.406 --> 18:38.951
or tests or anything else done to my cat.

18:39.034 --> 18:40.452
And I want you to sign this.

18:40.536 --> 18:44.289
There are still several more tests
we can perform, Mr. Hill.

18:44.373 --> 18:47.501
You see, we have a responsibility
to these creatures.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.128
Duke can't tell us he wants to live...

18:49.211 --> 18:51.505
Yeah, yeah, I know
and he can't joke around.

18:51.588 --> 18:52.965
But I bet if he could talk,

18:53.048 --> 18:56.802
he'd say he wants to be put through
the Magnetic Ultrasonic Imager.

18:56.885 --> 18:57.886
I've got one of those.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.473
9220.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.309
Says here that the 9220

19:04.393 --> 19:07.729
is seven percent more accurate
than the old 9210.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.732
Yes, but seven percent
more accuracy

19:10.816 --> 19:12.901
hardly justifies me
spending that kind of money.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.113
I'd have to use the machine on pets
and their owners to break even.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.281
It's just too expensive.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.324
Well, that seems like the kind of decision

19:19.408 --> 19:21.702
you'd want to leave
to that woman and her bird,

19:21.785 --> 19:22.744
or that guy and...

19:22.828 --> 19:24.872
whatever the hell that thing is.

19:24.955 --> 19:27.875
I'm sure they'd like to know
you've been depriving them

19:27.958 --> 19:30.836
of the latest in full-body
diagnostic testing.

19:30.919 --> 19:33.630
I wish I had enough
of these pamphlets for everyone.

19:33.714 --> 19:36.675
Hey, I guess I could go out there
and read it out loud.

19:36.758 --> 19:38.177
Now hold on a minute.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.761
That machine would bankrupt me.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.597
I've got to draw the line somewhere.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.183
We all have to draw the line somewhere.

19:44.266 --> 19:47.936
Is that 9220 something
you should be using on Frank?

19:51.273 --> 19:52.983
You can keep that pen.

19:53.066 --> 19:56.195
It's from some company
that makes Viagra for lizards.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.946
Works for snakes, too.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.329
Well, it's 3:00.

20:05.412 --> 20:09.124
Right about now, Dr. Leslie
is turning Duke over to Private Hennessey.

20:12.461 --> 20:15.464
Look, I know this isn't the kind of trip
we all had in mind.

20:15.756 --> 20:19.301
Bobby, why don't you go ahead
and have the "21-Rib Salute?"

20:19.635 --> 20:22.888
Really? It's not an entree, it's an event.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.975
So, how much money do we have left
in the vacation fund?

20:27.601 --> 20:29.686
Ninety-eight dollars.

20:29.811 --> 20:32.648
Which means, well,
this is as far as we can go.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.653
You know, just being away from Duke
feels like a holiday.

20:37.736 --> 20:40.322
Good food, family, the Cowboys.

20:40.405 --> 20:43.116
Now this is what I call a dream vacation.

20:45.953 --> 20:49.039
Army sergeant Bill Dauterive
relinquishing command of Buster.

20:49.122 --> 20:52.000
On behalf of myself and the crew
of the USS <i>Eisenhower,</i>

20:52.084 --> 20:52.918
I say thank you.

20:59.466 --> 21:00.592
Wow.

21:02.177 --> 21:05.389
-How you getting home, Sergeant?
-I, I, uh...

21:07.266 --> 21:11.061
You ever pulled two Gs? Don't worry.
Buster'll sit on your lap.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.144
-<i>Oh, this has been</i><i>a cat-astrophe.</i>
