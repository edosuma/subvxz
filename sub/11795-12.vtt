<i>( bell rings )</i>

00:04.270 --> 00:06.673
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.705 --> 00:09.542
  <i>* I don't think I'll ever</i>
  <i>make it on time</i>

00:09.576 --> 00:12.479
  <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
  <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.512 --> 00:16.216
 <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
 <i>just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.248 --> 00:21.688
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.721 --> 00:24.824
   <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
   <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:27.761
   <i>* And my dog ate</i>
   <i>all my homework last night</i>

00:27.794 --> 00:30.663
  <i>* Ridin' low on my chair</i>
  <i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

00:30.697 --> 00:34.167
 <i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>

00:34.200 --> 00:38.838
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:52.819 --> 00:56.256
   <i>* It's all right</i>
   <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:56.289 --> 00:58.625
   <i>* It's all right</i>

00:58.658 --> 01:03.096
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved</i>
   <i>by the bell *</i>

01:16.109 --> 01:18.411
 Does everyone know their parts
 in this movie?

01:18.445 --> 01:20.180
I want it to be great.

01:20.213 --> 01:23.083
   Hey, relax, Preppie.
   It's only a student film.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.252
   Quiet on the set.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.258
  All right. Now Jessie,
  you're the history teacher.

01:32.292 --> 01:35.829
The alien will come through
that door and
suck out your brain.

01:35.862 --> 01:38.365
 Zack, why can't he
 suck out your brain?

01:38.398 --> 01:41.768
 Because someone
 already did.

01:41.801 --> 01:45.138
 Very funny.
 All right, places, everybody.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.342
"Alien Invasion of Bayside"
take one.

01:50.543 --> 01:52.579
   Cue the hideous
   creature.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.115
   Hi, guys.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.717
Cut.
Wrong hideous creature.

01:57.751 --> 02:00.286
   - How's the movie going?
   - Great, Mr. B.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.455
   Thanks for letting us use
   the school's new camera.

02:02.489 --> 02:04.457
   Just be careful with it.

02:04.491 --> 02:07.127
 We have waited two years
 to get this video equipment.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.495
  You've got my word.

02:08.527 --> 02:11.231
   That's what
   makes me nervous.

02:12.365 --> 02:15.135
   All right, now,
   places everybody.

02:15.168 --> 02:17.070
   - Take two.
   - ( slate snaps )

02:18.238 --> 02:20.373
Action!

02:20.407 --> 02:23.309
   As you know, the Battle
   of Gettysburg was
   the turning point

02:23.343 --> 02:26.079
   of the Civil War.
   Until that time,

02:26.112 --> 02:28.248
the South had the North
on the run.

02:28.281 --> 02:30.417
( sputtering )

02:32.452 --> 02:37.090
   The alien is sucking out
   her brain!

02:37.090 --> 02:41.094
  Mighty fine brains.

02:41.127 --> 02:45.498
After the battle one
of the great speeches in
history was made by...

02:45.532 --> 02:48.601
  President Pee Wee Herman.
  ( mimics laugh )

02:50.804 --> 02:53.406
 Our teacher's hurt.
 Get the school nurse.

02:55.475 --> 02:59.245
   This is awful.
   Her head's empty.

02:59.279 --> 03:00.847
 Who did this?

03:00.880 --> 03:03.650
   Don't look at me.
   I'm an innocent
   alien bystander.

03:03.683 --> 03:07.487
 Don't trust him.
 He has brain breath.

03:07.520 --> 03:11.725
   Turn your sweet little head.
   I want some dessert.

03:11.758 --> 03:15.462
   Back off, bug face.
   No one messes up my hair.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.732
   Ow-ww!
   My tooth!

03:18.765 --> 03:21.234
   Cut, cut!
   This isn't in the script.

03:23.236 --> 03:25.372
   Ooh... when Belding
   hears about this,

03:25.405 --> 03:27.207
  he's really going
  to be mad.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.810
   Wow. You think he cares
   that much about my tooth?

03:34.080 --> 03:37.083
 Don't you understand?
 I am president of the school.

03:37.083 --> 03:39.085
 My whole reputation
 is at stake.

03:39.119 --> 03:42.088
  I promised Mr. Belding
  I'd be
  responsible for the camera.

03:42.122 --> 03:45.091
 Look guys,
 why don't we all chip in
 and buy a new camera?

03:45.125 --> 03:47.227
Great idea.
How much does it cost?

03:47.260 --> 03:49.596
Around $1,200.

03:49.629 --> 03:51.765
   Well, I have $23.

03:51.798 --> 03:54.501
I have $36 saved
from birthday presents.

03:54.534 --> 03:58.338
- How about you, Lisa?
- I owe my father $112.

03:58.371 --> 04:02.242
   Then I think the best thing
   to do is... blame Jessie.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.113
 Me?
 How can you blame me?

04:07.147 --> 04:09.349
  That is so irresponsible,
  so disloyal, so...

04:09.382 --> 04:13.186
Oh, stop being
a "stiff pickle," okay?

04:14.688 --> 04:18.158
  This is nothing.
  Here's a guy
  with real trouble.

04:18.190 --> 04:22.062
  A swarm of bees
  carried him off
  to be their queen.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.332
 Say what?
 What are you reading?

04:26.366 --> 04:28.401
"The National Babbler."

04:28.435 --> 04:31.371
 It's one of
 those trashy papers
 that makes up their own news.

04:31.404 --> 04:34.207
 Yeah, they'll print anything.

04:34.240 --> 04:38.545
 Hey, look at this.
 "The Babbler" will pay $1500

04:38.578 --> 04:40.580
 for "the best picture
 of an alien."

04:40.613 --> 04:43.183
   - Let me see that.
   - Zack:
   Look at that right there.

04:43.216 --> 04:45.485
$1500?

04:45.518 --> 04:48.088
Guys, we could buy
a new camera with that.

04:48.088 --> 04:52.092
 I know, but where on earth
 are we going to find an alien?

05:08.174 --> 05:10.543
 Jessie, what are you doing
 dressed like that?

05:10.577 --> 05:12.712
   Trying to avoid Belding.

05:12.746 --> 05:15.181
   He's been asking me
   for that camera all week.

05:15.215 --> 05:18.051
 - I feel so guilty.
 - You shouldn't
 feel guilty, Jessie.

05:18.084 --> 05:21.121
You should feel stupid.

05:24.424 --> 05:26.526
 Excuse me.
 You're new here, aren't you?

05:26.559 --> 05:28.561
  Welcome to Bayside.

05:28.595 --> 05:30.563
 <i>No comprende, senor.</i>

05:30.597 --> 05:33.667
 Oh. You must be
 an exchange student.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.402
  <i>Si.</i>

05:35.435 --> 05:40.173
What's your name...
I mean, <i>nombre?</i>

05:40.206 --> 05:42.175
<i>Nombre?</i>

05:42.208 --> 05:46.079
Maria...
Maria Tortilla.

05:46.112 --> 05:48.081
   Beautiful name.
   Nice to meet you.

05:48.114 --> 05:51.551
 - I hope you like America.
 - America, <i>si.</i>

05:53.620 --> 05:55.588
 - Hi, Mr. Belding.
 - Hey, Zack.

05:55.622 --> 05:58.224
   - Hi, Jessie.
   - Jessie?

05:58.258 --> 06:01.227
   <i>- Buenos nachos.</i>
   - Not so fast,
   "Miss Tortilla."

06:01.261 --> 06:04.197
What is going on,
Jessie?

06:04.230 --> 06:08.168
 What's going on?
 Golly, that's a good question.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.371
   Zack, you want to answer
   for "Hessie"?

06:13.473 --> 06:16.343
 Well, sir, we've just finished
 our movie.

06:16.376 --> 06:22.649
 You've heard of Batman?
 Jessie played "Bat-mamacita."

06:22.682 --> 06:26.052
   Good.
   Then where is my camera?

06:26.052 --> 06:28.254
   Right here, sir.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.460
   I've got to hand it
   to you, Preppie.

06:33.493 --> 06:37.263
  I never thought "The Babbler"
  would believe
  Screech as an alien.

06:38.531 --> 06:40.734
 Zack Morris?

06:44.270 --> 06:46.339
  I'm looking
  for a Zack Morris.

06:46.373 --> 06:49.242
  I'm a Zack Morris.

06:49.275 --> 06:51.077
  Did you take this picture?

06:51.111 --> 06:53.146
Actually,
we all took it.

06:53.179 --> 06:56.416
  Then I'd like to ask you
  a few questions,
  if you don't mind.

06:56.449 --> 06:58.685
  Oh, you must be
  from the newspaper.

06:58.718 --> 07:01.087
   They said they might send
   somebody to interview us.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.223
   Interview?
   Oh, right, right.

07:04.557 --> 07:07.093
 The name's Thompson.

07:07.127 --> 07:10.296
   Now tell me, have you seen
   the alien more than once?

07:10.330 --> 07:13.133
I see him a lot more
than I want to.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.135
 Fascinating.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.771
Sounds like you've had many
close encounters
with the creature.

07:17.804 --> 07:20.040
   Don't remind me.

07:20.073 --> 07:24.210
   Wow.
   You know,
   close encounters like...

07:24.244 --> 07:26.446
   like that are
   worth big money.

07:26.479 --> 07:29.182
Really?
Like how much?

07:29.215 --> 07:32.519
  We'd pay $10,000
  if I could meet this alien.

07:32.552 --> 07:34.621
   $10,000?

07:34.654 --> 07:36.656
Do you mind
if we speak privately?

07:36.690 --> 07:40.226
 Not at all.
 What do you want to tell me?

07:41.061 --> 07:43.063
   I meant
   with my friends.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.131
  You meant
  with your friends.

07:45.165 --> 07:48.635
   I knew that.
   I'll be right over here.

07:48.668 --> 07:52.472
 Zack,
 whatever you're thinking,
 just stop. We were lucky once.

07:52.505 --> 07:55.375
  All we have to do is convince
  this guy that
  Screech is an alien.

07:55.408 --> 07:58.211
   - Why would he believe that?
   - Because he wants to.

07:58.244 --> 08:01.147
I mean, come on, this guy
would believe anything.

08:01.181 --> 08:04.150
   - Guys,
   what do we have to lose?
   - Right.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.453
  For 10,000 bucks,
  let's take a shot.

08:06.486 --> 08:10.023
 - I don't like this.
 - Who cares?

08:10.056 --> 08:13.093
 Look, just trust me.
 This will work, okay?

08:17.364 --> 08:19.566
 Mr. Thompson?

08:21.234 --> 08:23.336
I think I can
arrange a meeting
with you and the alien.

08:23.370 --> 08:26.706
   Wow. Here's my number.
   Call me anytime.

08:26.740 --> 08:29.342
   All right.
   I'll be in touch.

08:31.211 --> 08:34.214
 Eagle three,
 this is Lieutenant Thompson.

08:34.246 --> 08:37.082
  We've made contact.

08:44.824 --> 08:46.926
  Hey Screech,
  how'd it go at the dentist?

08:46.960 --> 08:51.097
   I had my tooth filled this
   morning and now I pick
   up radio stations.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.234
- Zack: You're kidding.
- Come on.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.836
 ( dance music plays )

09:01.007 --> 09:03.009
   It's kind of neat.
   Except when this big guy

09:03.009 --> 09:07.380
   held me up to his ear and
   tried to shove
   a cassette in my mouth.

09:07.414 --> 09:10.483
 We've got something really
 important to
 talk to you about.

09:10.517 --> 09:15.922
 Radio DJ: <i>Hello, L.A.</i>

09:16.022 --> 09:18.825
 Does this happen
 all the time?

09:18.858 --> 09:20.860
 DJ: <i>The time is 9:00.</i>

09:20.894 --> 09:23.029
Just depends
on where I'm standing.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.732
 Well, let's move you.

09:25.765 --> 09:28.501
   <i>( radio tuning, static )</i>

09:32.372 --> 09:34.774
- There we go.
- There, that's better.

09:34.808 --> 09:37.877
All right now, Screech,
if we can
convince "The Babbler"

09:37.911 --> 09:42.048
  that you really are an alien,
  they'll pay us $10,000.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.085
- Gee, I don't know.
- Now, Screech,

09:45.118 --> 09:48.521
  just think of what you can do
  with your share.

09:48.555 --> 09:51.925
  I could buy a new tractor
  for my ant farm.

09:51.958 --> 09:53.960
  Then you'll do it?

09:54.060 --> 09:56.062
I'll have to let
you know later.

09:56.062 --> 09:58.898
 I've got to drop
 this doctor's note
 off at Mr. Belding's office.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.867
All right, well meet us
at lunch, okay?

10:00.900 --> 10:03.303
  Announcer: <i>For country eatin'</i>
 <i>there's no beatin'</i>

10:03.336 --> 10:06.940
   <i>Billy Joe Bob's</i>
   <i>House O' Possum.</i>

10:10.310 --> 10:13.446
 Let me get this straight...
 you're
 a lieutenant in the Air Force?

10:13.480 --> 10:16.249
 - Where's your uniform?
 - It's under my suit.

10:16.282 --> 10:19.285
I'm working undercover.
( laughs )

10:19.319 --> 10:22.055
   It's a little
   Air Force humor.

10:22.088 --> 10:25.158
Dale Thompson,
UFO Investigation Unit.

10:26.926 --> 10:28.895
  Bad spot for that.

10:28.928 --> 10:31.498
 I'll get 'em.
 It's okay. It's okay.

10:31.531 --> 10:34.067
  I'm here to investigate
  an alien sighting.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.803
   You really believe there are
   people here
   from other planets?

10:36.836 --> 10:39.839
  Well, they have to be
  somewhere.

10:39.873 --> 10:43.476
  Lieutenant,
  I think you're wasting
  your time here at Bayside.

10:43.510 --> 10:46.179
 The only flying saucers here
 are in the school cafeteria.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.451
  Then there have been
  sightings?

10:51.484 --> 10:55.488
   That was a joke, Lieutenant,
   like food fights, kids...

10:55.522 --> 10:57.957
Oh, a joke?
That's very...

10:57.991 --> 11:00.960
  I'm new on the job,
  Mr. Belding. I have to check
  out everything.

11:01.061 --> 11:04.464
 Besides, one of your students
 claims to have made contact.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.866
 What student?

11:06.900 --> 11:08.835
 Zack Morris.

11:10.136 --> 11:12.906
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, I got it.

11:12.939 --> 11:16.943
I'll just put it over here.
Zack Morris, huh?

11:16.976 --> 11:20.814
  Listen the only thing "alien"
  to Zack Morris
  is good behavior.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.383
  Why don't I just
  show you his file?

11:28.855 --> 11:32.092
   You know, maybe
   I better hold onto this.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.994
  Please.
  I've got two hands.

11:42.969 --> 11:47.140
  I'll look
  through this material.
  Fascinating stuff.

11:47.173 --> 11:50.910
 Trust me, there's nothing
 unusual going on at Bayside.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.246
  Except perhaps you.

11:53.279 --> 11:55.315
 - ( intercom buzzes )
<i>- Mr. Belding?</i>

11:57.350 --> 11:59.819
   - Yes?
  <i>- Please report to the gym.</i>

11:59.853 --> 12:03.790
<i>The water polo team</i>
<i>has a horse in the pool again.</i>

12:03.823 --> 12:05.859
  Thank you.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.828
 Kids love horseplay.

12:09.929 --> 12:13.166
  Excuse me.
  I'll be right back.

12:17.103 --> 12:20.240
 ( knocking )

12:20.273 --> 12:22.809
   Hi. I'm looking
   for Mr. Belding.

12:22.842 --> 12:23.910
 He just left.

12:23.943 --> 12:27.881
  I'll just leave this note
  on his desk.

12:27.914 --> 12:31.951
Pilot: <i>Wind, three-five</i>
<i>pressure. Ready to land.</i>
<i>We are coming in.</i>

12:31.985 --> 12:33.987
What was that?

12:34.087 --> 12:36.256
  Ground control: <i>Come in,</i>
 <i>vector-niner-zebra...</i>

12:36.289 --> 12:38.792
Wait a minute.

12:38.825 --> 12:42.529
Who, or should I say
what, are you?

12:44.464 --> 12:46.433
  Zack: <i>Come on, Screech.</i>
 <i>Don't worry about it.</i>

12:46.466 --> 12:50.103
  It'll be easy to convince
  Mr.
  Thompson you're from space.

12:50.136 --> 12:52.138
   I don't know
   if I can do that.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.174
   Screech, we're all going
   to be there to help you.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.142
 - Jessie: Yeah.
 - Zack: That's right.

12:56.176 --> 12:59.012
   Just for insurance,
   I asked Max
   to show you a few tricks.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.949
   I think I can teach you
   how to act like an alien.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.918
You remember Mork,
from "Mork and Mindy"?

13:04.951 --> 13:07.053
 He had a strange way
 of drinking.

13:07.053 --> 13:09.856
  Lisa, could I have
  some of your malt?

13:13.226 --> 13:15.295
 - Whoa!
 - All right!

13:16.963 --> 13:18.798
  ( burps )
  Excuse me.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.768
Screech: That's great, Max.
Do some more.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.372
  This one's from
  my Uncle Martin.
  He's "My Favorite Martian."

13:25.405 --> 13:28.074
   This one will
   convince anyone.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.815
  This is all great, Max,
  but we have to make

13:35.849 --> 13:38.084
   this reporter believe
   that Screech is an alien.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.887
 The best illusions are created
 in the mind of the beholder.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.123
 Here's what
 we can do...

13:43.156 --> 13:45.392
 Zack: This way,
 Mr. Thompson.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.427
   This is where we usually
   see the alien.

13:47.460 --> 13:53.099
   I still don't understand why
   an alien would
   appear at a school.

13:53.099 --> 13:56.002
 Maybe he wants to take English
 as a second language.

13:56.102 --> 13:58.138
 <i>( electronic whirr )</i>

13:59.506 --> 14:02.042
 Hey, I heard those same noises
 the last time,

14:02.042 --> 14:04.411
  just before
  the alien appeared.

14:08.481 --> 14:12.952
 Telekinesis. A sure sign
 of a close encounter.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.290
  Mr. Thompson,
  that's him.

14:17.323 --> 14:20.260
   That's it.
   That's the alien.

14:20.293 --> 14:23.830
  Amazing.
  Another life form.

14:28.835 --> 14:31.371
 He likes you.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.811
   Mr. Thompson,
   I wouldn't get too close.

14:37.844 --> 14:41.214
  Oh, I have to. This is a once
  in a lifetime opportunity.

14:41.247 --> 14:44.317
 Greetings.
 I come here in peace.

14:44.351 --> 14:48.088
  Greetings back.
  I came in my mother's car.

14:48.121 --> 14:52.125
   - I mean, my mothership.
   - He speaks our language.

14:52.158 --> 14:54.127
  It must be
  instantaneous translation.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.796
  Yeah, I have an ear
  for human.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.838
  - ( antenna clatters )
  - ( Screech gasps )

15:04.871 --> 15:07.874
 I think it's
 time for the alien
 to return to his planet now.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.510
Wait a minute.
Something
weird's going on here.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.046
   That's what close encounters
   are all about, sir.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.382
   Now about that
   $10,000 check...

15:15.415 --> 15:17.851
if he's an alien,
I'm from Mars.

15:17.884 --> 15:20.253
- I'll take
an out-of-state check.
- Who are you?

15:20.286 --> 15:22.956
News anchor:
<i>This is Biff Logan</i>
<i>with the nightly news.</i>

15:23.056 --> 15:24.958
 I've heard that mouth before.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.893
  You're that weird kid I saw
  in the principal's office.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.362
All right,
what is going on here?

15:29.396 --> 15:33.466
 Hey everyone. Come on out.
 The game's over.

15:40.907 --> 15:42.776
  You saw right
  through us.

15:42.809 --> 15:45.912
  So this was all just
  some teenage prank?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.914
 Who do you think
 you're fooling, kid?

15:47.947 --> 15:50.950
For one thing,
I'm not a kid.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.956
I'm tired of pretending
I'm one of you ugly
humans all these years.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.893
Screech, what are you
talking about?

15:59.926 --> 16:03.029
 I'm not Screech.
 I'm "Zorch."

16:07.100 --> 16:09.269
He really is an alien.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.038
This explains so much.

16:12.038 --> 16:14.407
 This is truly
 an historic occasion.

16:14.441 --> 16:17.110
  Even when I
  thought it was real
  and sensed it was a prank,

16:17.143 --> 16:19.913
 I really still sensed
 it was real.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.948
   Once we get the alien
   to Washington,
   we'll have to see

16:22.048 --> 16:24.951
 - about getting
 you kids a medal.
 - And $10,000, right?

16:25.051 --> 16:27.120
Well, that'd be up
to the government, son.

16:27.153 --> 16:30.924
 I'm Lieutenant Thompson,
 Special Agent, UFO Division.

16:30.957 --> 16:32.792
  - You're with the government?
  - That's right.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.527
 I'm taking the alien
 in for tests.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.863
 - Tests?
 - What kind of tests?

16:36.896 --> 16:40.066
  We'll know more about our new
  little friend
  once we dissect him.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.969
Dissect?
Yikes!

16:46.873 --> 16:49.476
   ( keystrokes clattering )

16:59.452 --> 17:01.287
 Hey, Screech.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.289
 How about
 turning off the light
 and finishing it another day?

17:03.323 --> 17:07.060
 There might not
 be another day.
 I'm writing my will.

17:07.093 --> 17:09.128
Oh-hh!

17:11.164 --> 17:14.067
 After I'm gone, make sure Lisa
 gets my reptile collection.

17:14.099 --> 17:17.037
 It'll ease her pain.

17:17.069 --> 17:19.305
 Look, will you relax?

17:19.339 --> 17:22.375
 By noontime tomorrow I'll have
 this all
 straightened out, okay?

17:22.409 --> 17:24.477
 Now can we go
 to sleep now?

17:32.552 --> 17:35.088
  I got to say
  my prayers.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.498
  Dear "Big Guy in the Sky,"

17:47.233 --> 17:50.270
  it's "The Screecher" again.

17:51.705 --> 17:54.507
 Well, I guess I'm gonna be
 seeing you real soon.

17:55.642 --> 17:59.145
If I have to go to heaven,
can Zack come with me?

18:04.384 --> 18:09.189
 The first day in
 a new place is hard
 when you don't know anybody.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.224
 Amen.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.694
 - Let's turn in!
 - Thank you.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.239
 Hey Screech,

18:26.272 --> 18:28.675
  you really want me to go
  to heaven with you?

18:28.708 --> 18:32.812
 Of course.
 You're my best friend.
 I'd really miss you.

18:37.751 --> 18:39.819
   Thanks, Screech.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.261
 Zack?

18:48.294 --> 18:49.429
 Yeah?

18:49.462 --> 18:52.432
 Do they wear underwear
 in heaven?

18:57.370 --> 19:00.240
   ( high-pitched chuckle )

19:00.273 --> 19:02.275
  Let me get this straight,
  Lieutenant,

19:02.308 --> 19:04.644
   you think Screech Powers
   is an alien?

19:04.678 --> 19:09.149
   He's the most bizarre
   creature I've ever seen.

19:09.182 --> 19:12.452
That's true,
but it doesn't mean
he's from outer space.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.121
 Are you questioning
 my expertise?

19:16.656 --> 19:18.625
 Or are you just
 covering up?

19:18.658 --> 19:21.027
 Aliens never travel alone,
 you know.

19:21.061 --> 19:23.063
 Let me see those ears,
 mister.

19:23.096 --> 19:25.331
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
Let go!

19:25.365 --> 19:27.400
You know, maybe
you should just leave.

19:27.434 --> 19:31.037
 You're disrupting my school,
 and frankly you're bugging me.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.239
Okay, Belding.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.241
   You're messing
   with the federal
   government here.

19:35.275 --> 19:38.545
 And Uncle Sam can
 get pretty crabby
 with a guy like you.

19:38.578 --> 19:43.149
 Produce that alien by 3:00
 and that's an order, mister.

19:45.752 --> 19:48.121
<i>( door closes )</i>

19:49.122 --> 19:51.224
Forgot my hat.

19:52.125 --> 19:53.393
 You really think this'll work?

19:53.426 --> 19:55.595
 Have I ever let you down, sir?

19:55.628 --> 19:58.531
  I wish you hadn't
  said that.

19:58.565 --> 20:01.768
 Well, Belding, I'm glad to see
 you came to your senses.

20:01.801 --> 20:05.672
- Now where's my alien?
- He'll be
beaming in momentarily.

20:05.705 --> 20:09.075
 - ( lockers bang )
 - Screech: I'm here!

20:09.109 --> 20:12.278
  Come on out, Screech.
  The lieutenant is waiting.

20:16.716 --> 20:20.253
  Well, I see he's back
  to wearing that
  strange-looking human mask.

20:20.286 --> 20:22.589
   Hey, the strange-looking
   part is me.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.591
All right, you might have
fooled me once before,

20:24.624 --> 20:26.626
but this time
you're coming with me.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.529
 Are you sure you have
 the right alien, Lieutenant?

20:34.901 --> 20:37.137
   What's going on?

20:40.640 --> 20:42.609
 What is this, a joke?

20:42.642 --> 20:45.645
 Like you said, Lieutenant,
 "Aliens never travel alone."

20:45.679 --> 20:48.581
 That's right. Looks like
 if you're going to take one...

20:48.615 --> 20:51.217
You're going to have
to take us all.

20:53.153 --> 20:55.822
   I'm not really an alien,
   Lieutenant.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.757
 I just used this
 to fool you.

20:57.791 --> 21:00.326
   Well that's
   not very honest.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.596
   Neither is
   telling a bunch of kids
   you're from a newspaper.

21:03.630 --> 21:06.599
   - Zack: That's right.
   - Students: Yeah!

21:06.633 --> 21:11.171
  I knew I should have listened
  to my mother and
  become a doctor.

21:11.204 --> 21:13.640
I guess we won't be
seeing him for a while.

21:16.242 --> 21:19.079
 We might be seeing him
 sooner than we had hoped, sir.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.114
These are his car keys.

21:21.147 --> 21:24.117
- Zack!
- It was a backup plan.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.852
  I couldn't let him
  take away my buddy.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.254
Hey, you realize
this is the first time

21:28.288 --> 21:30.290
we've been on the same side
on anything?

21:30.323 --> 21:34.260
  - That's right.
  - We should
  team up more often.

21:34.294 --> 21:37.197
   ( together )
   Mmm... I don't think so.
