My father met with you

I wanna know what
you told him that night.

00:15.319 --> 00:16.799

I don't wanna say no, but I have
to. My family is a disaster.

Are you sure it's your family

- Don't go with him.
- Well, you're too late.

- I already told him I would.
- Tell him you're not.

It's not about Aaron.
It's about our parents.

understand your sudden flip.

I don't know. I...I guess
it was the snowflake ball.

after the funeral.

to go look for him.

02:32.935 --> 02:34.241
Wait, since when do
you have an Uncle Jack?

It's Bart's younger brother.
