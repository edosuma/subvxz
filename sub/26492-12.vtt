00:08.258 --> 00:10.176
[narrator] <i>Previously on</i> Riverdale:

00:10.260 --> 00:12.637
-What are you doing?
-What we did all summer.

00:12.721 --> 00:14.806
[Moose] My dad is right over there.

00:15.015 --> 00:15.849
Why?

00:16.266 --> 00:18.268
He's the new RROTC instructor.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.854
-Welcome, cadets.
-Excuse me, Major Mason.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.522
Hope it's not too late to join.

00:22.605 --> 00:24.691
Can I get another bartender in here?

00:25.483 --> 00:27.068
Toby. Toby. I know him.
Listen, Andrews.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.322
You are in freefall,
and I am not having it.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.324
You broke the code.
Turn in your jackets and go.

00:33.408 --> 00:34.409
[Toni] You serious, Jones?

00:34.492 --> 00:37.454
I'm a Serpent by blood.
You can't take that away from me.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.582
[Veronica] I think my mom may have
hired someone to shoot my father,

00:40.665 --> 00:43.501
so she could profit
from the sale of his drug operation.

00:43.585 --> 00:46.254
We're gonna destroy them
before my mom sells everything.

00:46.337 --> 00:47.380
[Hermione] What did you do?

00:47.464 --> 00:50.341
My buyer is coming, Veronica.
They are gonna want blood.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.432
[Jughead] <i>Riverdale is like Bizarro Town.</i>

00:57.724 --> 01:00.685
<i>Where murder, mystery,</i>
<i>and candy drugs aren't the exception,</i>

01:00.769 --> 01:01.770
<i>they're the norm.</i>

01:02.103 --> 01:04.064
<i>And you forget, sometimes,</i>

01:04.147 --> 01:06.399
<i>that people are still</i>
<i>just living their lives.</i>

01:06.775 --> 01:09.611
<i>Doing things as ordinary</i>
<i>as getting married.</i>

01:09.736 --> 01:11.071
You don't want a big wedding?

01:11.154 --> 01:13.239
We just finalized our divorces, Kevin.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.700
And this is the second marriage
for both of us.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.535
With everything that's going on
in Riverdale--

01:17.619 --> 01:20.288
We just wanna go down to Town Hall
and keep it simple.

01:21.539 --> 01:22.540
If I may.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.626
We fully disagree.

01:25.043 --> 01:28.880
But we're not the ones getting married,
so, we respect your decision,

01:29.464 --> 01:32.842
as long as you let us throw you
an after-party at La Bonne Nuit.

01:33.301 --> 01:34.135
Ah.

01:34.219 --> 01:37.097
If there's no wedding reception,
the Gargoyle King has won.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.018
Okay, but a small one.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.354
Fabulous, I'll send out invites today.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.107
-Marcus.
-Tom.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.234
Cadet Keller, ladies.

01:49.317 --> 01:51.653
-How are you all doing?
-We're good, thank you.

01:51.861 --> 01:53.696
Actually, we've got some news.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.282
Tom and I are finally tying the knot,

01:56.366 --> 01:59.744
and these two are throwing us
an after-party downstairs.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.789
You and Moose can be our first invites.
How about it?

02:03.665 --> 02:06.459
I'll... check my calendar, Sierra.

02:11.798 --> 02:12.799
What's his deal?

02:12.882 --> 02:15.552
Marcus and I used to be good friends.

02:15.635 --> 02:19.556
We did RROTC together,
but we just grew apart.

02:19.639 --> 02:22.350
It's probably the jealousy.

02:22.433 --> 02:23.268
Well...

02:23.643 --> 02:25.895
Marcus always had a crush on me,
as you know.
-[chuckles]
-But I only had eyes for you.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.315
Lucky me.

02:31.526 --> 02:32.443
Mm.

02:32.944 --> 02:35.363
Feels so good to sleep
in a real bed, doesn't it?

02:36.197 --> 02:38.491
Far away from the rural horrors
of Tent City?

02:38.992 --> 02:41.786
Well, I don't miss the cold or the mud,
that's true.

02:41.870 --> 02:42.704
But...

02:43.329 --> 02:44.330
I don't know.

02:45.039 --> 02:46.249
I miss the gang, babe.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.084
[cell phones beeping]

02:48.501 --> 02:49.502
[Cheryl sighs]

02:51.129 --> 02:52.714
Oh, my God, our SAT scores.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.925
I pray mine are good enough
for Highsmith College.

02:56.050 --> 02:58.386
Women of my family have gone there
for generations.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.597
I don't intend to break Blossom tradition.

03:06.561 --> 03:10.106
Much like <i>Desert Hearts,</i>
my score's not perfect, but it's close.

03:10.356 --> 03:11.566
How'd you fare, Tee-Tee?

03:14.402 --> 03:16.905
Flawless, as I've always known you to be.

03:17.906 --> 03:18.740
[chuckles]

03:20.366 --> 03:23.286
[Hermione] Since you two vigilantes
took it upon yourselves

03:23.369 --> 03:26.206
to burn all the Fizzle Rocks
that I had already sold,

03:26.289 --> 03:29.500
you are gonna come up with the money
to pay back what's owed.

03:31.294 --> 03:34.464
-How do we do that?
-I'd start with the speakeasy's coffers.

03:35.590 --> 03:39.594
We don't make nearly enough to pay off
whatever kingpin you're working with, Mom.

03:39.677 --> 03:41.971
Well, then I suggest you get creative,
<i>mija.</i>

03:42.055 --> 03:43.097
And quickly.

03:43.181 --> 03:46.351
The buyer who has a reputation
for being dangerously unhinged

03:46.434 --> 03:47.977
is on their way to Riverdale,

03:48.061 --> 03:51.648
and looking to get paid back in full
for the drugs they are not getting.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.068
Who is this buyer?

03:55.151 --> 03:57.654
You don't need to know.
They're sending an intermediary.

03:58.154 --> 04:01.241
How much money are we talking about,
Mrs. Lodge?

04:09.457 --> 04:12.335
And suddenly, I'm in an episode of <i>Ozark.</i>

04:12.418 --> 04:15.046
No, but you are in the big leagues now,

04:15.630 --> 04:17.423
and it is time to sink or swim.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.972
[Cheryl] Furthermore,
I've successfully balanced my duties

04:24.055 --> 04:27.433
as captain of the River Vixens
and president of the student body,

04:27.517 --> 04:30.061
whilst maintaining a 4.2 GPA,
perfect attendance,

04:30.144 --> 04:32.438
and achieving an almost perfect SAT store.

04:32.897 --> 04:33.982
For these reasons,

04:34.065 --> 04:36.526
I'm an exemplary candidate
for Highsmith College.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.695
Not to mention, I'm legacy.

04:39.153 --> 04:40.363
You are, Ms. Blossom.

04:40.905 --> 04:44.534
However, most recently,
Highsmith College's Board of Directors

04:44.617 --> 04:48.579
have decided it's time
to diversify our student body

04:48.663 --> 04:52.375
with women from outside the alumni pool.

04:53.751 --> 04:56.087
This is a new initiative?

04:56.170 --> 04:58.923
I'm afraid so.
But long overdue, don't you agree?

04:59.007 --> 05:01.009
Oh. Absolutely.

05:01.509 --> 05:04.971
I'm just imagining which board member
suddenly developed a conscience.

05:10.768 --> 05:13.271
Hey. I need to ask you something. Hey.

05:14.772 --> 05:17.233
-Will you be my date to my dad's wedding?
-Kevin--

05:17.317 --> 05:19.986
It's a public event.
You haven't come out to your dad.

05:20.069 --> 05:23.031
But maybe it's time.
I mean, how long have we been together?

05:23.698 --> 05:25.575
-Since summer started.
-So, forever.

05:26.075 --> 05:29.912
And I love a clandestine grope
as much as the next gay guy,

05:30.204 --> 05:31.956
but we've never spent a night together.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.418
-You don't think I want to?
-So do it. Just talk to your dad.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.921
-Dad.
-Major Mason.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.508
-Told you they were in here, sir.
-Cadet Mason, Cadet Keller.

05:42.925 --> 05:45.970
The meeting with the Naval Academy
recruitment officer is about to start.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.764
So, on the double.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.643
Sorry, Kev. I can't.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.398
[sighs]

06:01.152 --> 06:02.320
[Josie] Hey, Sweet Pea.

06:02.987 --> 06:04.739
Hope you don't mind me dropping by.

06:04.822 --> 06:06.407
Always happy to see you, Josie.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.576
Especially if this is a...

06:09.786 --> 06:10.787
A booty call?

06:11.162 --> 06:13.873
Wouldn't be our first one
since our summer fling ended.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.210
Well, it's not.

06:17.960 --> 06:18.795
Um...

06:19.253 --> 06:22.215
I don't know if you've heard,
but my mom is getting married.

06:22.673 --> 06:23.674
To Kevin's dad.

06:24.008 --> 06:27.387
And I wanted to know
if you would be my date to the wedding.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.389
As your boyfriend?

06:30.848 --> 06:32.517
Does it have to be so official?

06:32.600 --> 06:33.601
[chuckles]
Look, Josie...

06:36.270 --> 06:37.271
I like you.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.316
I'd be all in with you in a second, but...

06:41.484 --> 06:44.737
But you sliding into my life
whenever you don't wanna be alone...

06:45.655 --> 06:46.697
I'm not built that way.

06:47.698 --> 06:50.034
Maybe that makes me needy, but I just...

06:52.203 --> 06:54.497
I gotta get off
this merry-go-round with you.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.917
[jazz music playing]

07:03.673 --> 07:05.633
So, this is the infamous Maple Club.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.095
And no surprise,
it's as cheap and callow as your efforts

07:09.178 --> 07:11.347
to sabotage my admission
to your alma mater.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.351
I spoke to the headmistress
at Highsmith College.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.520
She enlightened me about a new policy

07:17.603 --> 07:20.523
that seems designed specifically
to keep me from attending.

07:20.606 --> 07:23.401
I can't think of anyone else
who would stoop so low, Mumzie.

07:23.568 --> 07:24.610
Care to explain?

07:24.694 --> 07:26.237
Oh, Cheryl.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.699
The hallowed halls of Highsmith
shall not be polluted

07:30.116 --> 07:33.035
by someone of your... alignment.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.538
You are an aberration.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.124
I'm so sure the alumni newsletter
would be thrilled

07:38.207 --> 07:41.544
to profile a twice-widowed dominatrix
with a proclivity for poison.

07:41.627 --> 07:44.714
With the financial gifts
I bestowed upon them over the years,

07:44.797 --> 07:46.299
I doubt they would bat an eye.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.010
Now, accept it, Cheryl.

07:49.093 --> 07:50.928
This is the price of salt.

07:51.512 --> 07:54.390
Your presence
shall not besmirch Highsmith.

07:58.519 --> 07:59.437
[chuckles]

07:59.854 --> 08:02.273
The charges against you are very serious.

08:02.356 --> 08:04.358
Oh, well, what do you suggest?

08:04.442 --> 08:06.486
I could request an injunction.

08:06.569 --> 08:09.280
[chuckles] I think
I'd like to go straight to trial.

08:09.363 --> 08:10.615
[both laughing]

08:12.825 --> 08:13.868
Where are you going?

08:13.951 --> 08:17.705
I am having a little snack
before having my other snack.

08:17.788 --> 08:18.706
[laughs]

08:24.378 --> 08:25.379
What is it?
"Fair Sierriana,

08:38.476 --> 08:39.519
Friar Thomas,

08:40.978 --> 08:43.564
congratulations on your upcoming nuptials.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.901
If you wish to live
to see this blessed event,

08:47.235 --> 08:49.612
you must reunite
with your Midnight Club to co--

08:50.404 --> 08:53.574
To complete Ascension Night,
once and for all."

08:56.869 --> 08:57.870
"Tell no one,

08:58.663 --> 09:00.498
or your children will pay the price.

09:01.415 --> 09:02.416
Best wishes...

09:03.834 --> 09:04.919
the Gargoyle King."

09:19.308 --> 09:22.311
Well, someone looks like
they could use an epaulet to cry on.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.398
I'm not trying to carb-shame you,

09:25.481 --> 09:27.817
but whatever's on your mind,
it's not worth it.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.528
So, put down the Swizzler,

09:31.028 --> 09:32.488
and tell me your tale of woe.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.198
I could use the distraction.

09:35.116 --> 09:35.992
Well...

09:36.909 --> 09:38.202
there's this guy.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.870
And we've been having problems.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.038
Moose, you mean?

09:42.123 --> 09:43.541
Please. I have eyes.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.626
I saw you lounging together
at my pool party,

09:45.710 --> 09:48.129
like a community theater production
of <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley.</i>

09:48.421 --> 09:50.631
The Koose ship's been trouble
from the gay get-go.

09:50.715 --> 09:53.050
Maybe it's time you move on.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.177
I can't go back to Fox Forest.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.430
Oh, sullen, tender-hearted Kevin.

09:58.389 --> 10:00.224
I'm not talking about cruising.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.643
I'm talking about Bumble.

10:05.229 --> 10:06.272
Look.

10:07.481 --> 10:11.402
I'm sure you can find a well-adjusted,
handsome, out-and-proud fella here.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.613
That'd be nice.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.781
But I like Moose a lot.

10:16.574 --> 10:20.578
I just wish he'd be honest with his dad,
so we could date, you know, openly.

10:20.661 --> 10:21.621
What's his hang-up?

10:21.704 --> 10:25.499
Major Mason's not the biggest fan
of our persuasion.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.794
It burns me that there are people
in this town that still believe

10:28.878 --> 10:31.922
that being gay is anything less
than rapturous.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.595
Maybe Moose would come out
if he liked me more.

10:37.845 --> 10:40.306
No. It's not your fault, Kevin.

10:40.389 --> 10:43.059
Your aesthetic may be firmly rooted
in the 1950s,

10:43.142 --> 10:45.186
but you're a catch in any decade.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.271
As for the object of your affection,

10:47.355 --> 10:51.525
maybe he just needs
the subtlest of nudges.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.196
A bulldozer wouldn't be enough.

10:56.864 --> 10:59.784
Attention, students,
it's time for the daily announcements.

11:00.034 --> 11:03.204
As Riverdale High's first openly lesbian
student body president,

11:03.621 --> 11:07.708
<i>I'm announcing the launch of a new club.</i>
<i>An LGBTQIA alliance.</i>

11:07.792 --> 11:11.420
<i>With the mission to find and support</i>
<i>our queer and questioning students.</i>

11:11.504 --> 11:15.007
In that spirit,
this week's blind item will be on theme.

11:15.925 --> 11:20.179
A certain oh-so-hunky,
all-American RROTC cadet is afraid

11:20.262 --> 11:21.597
to come out of the closet.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.018
Let's show him
that Riverdale High is welcoming,

11:26.102 --> 11:28.688
so he and his Broadway-loving boyfriend
can finally PDA,

11:28.771 --> 11:31.232
like the other sex-crazed couples
amongst us.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.861
For lunch today,
we're having shepherd's pie. Thank you.

11:39.573 --> 11:42.785
-[Moose] Did you put Cheryl up to that?
-What, her not-so-blind item?

11:42.868 --> 11:43.869
Of course not.

11:44.328 --> 11:47.957
I'm opposed to publicly outing people,
except conservative politicians.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.500
Have people guessed it's you?

11:50.209 --> 11:51.043
No.

11:52.002 --> 11:53.170
I don't know, maybe.

11:53.629 --> 11:54.463
Moose...

11:55.506 --> 11:58.968
Putting aside what Cheryl did,
we've been together for a while now.

11:59.051 --> 12:02.054
I can't keep playing Brokeback Riverdale
with someone who's in the closet.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.682
Either you come out to your dad,

12:04.765 --> 12:07.184
or, I'm sorry, but we're breaking up.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.771
Either way, I respect your decision.

12:21.949 --> 12:24.368
-What the hell were you thinking?
-Just now?

12:24.452 --> 12:26.662
About the sweet revenge
I'll get on Mumzie.

12:26.746 --> 12:30.332
Hopefully with help from you,
and your camera, shutterbug of my dreams.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.585
-You just outed Moose.
-No, I didn't.

12:33.252 --> 12:36.505
It was a blind item, Toni.
No one knows I was referring to him.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.758
Moose's father could've heard
that announcement.

12:38.841 --> 12:42.219
-Oh, my God. Is this our first fight?
-Cheryl, get some perspective.

12:43.345 --> 12:46.348
Did you know that my uncle hated the fact
that I dated girls?

12:46.891 --> 12:49.518
That's why the Serpents
were so important to me.

12:51.061 --> 12:54.106
They were like my non-judgmental family.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.067
Now I don't have them.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.029
Toni, I'm sorry.

13:00.696 --> 13:01.739
I didn't realize.

13:01.822 --> 13:02.948
Of course you didn't.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.326
Because you're too busy being Cheryl,

13:05.409 --> 13:07.870
causing chaos,
regardless of the consequences.

13:08.037 --> 13:08.913
Look, babe.

13:08.996 --> 13:13.209
I get that you're mad at your mom,
and you're pissed that you're not going

13:13.292 --> 13:15.961
to some college
that I could never get into or afford.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.547
-If it's about money--
-Just stop and listen to me.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.469
Highsmith College was your legacy.

13:25.429 --> 13:26.680
The Serpents were mine.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.267
Now they're not.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.187
Toni, I'll...

13:33.813 --> 13:35.147
I'll fix this.

13:35.815 --> 13:36.774
What part?

13:37.191 --> 13:38.317
All of it.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.530
You are the most important person
in my life.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.368
I'll do whatever it takes
to make all these things right.

13:49.286 --> 13:50.704
But I may need your help.

14:02.758 --> 14:03.759
Josie. Hey.
Archie, hey.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.262
Am I interrupting?

14:07.471 --> 14:08.597
I was just practicing.

14:09.348 --> 14:12.768
There is a recruiter from Juilliard
holding local auditions,

14:12.852 --> 14:14.687
and my slot's this afternoon.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.189
Don't be nervous. You're gonna kill it.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.358
[laughs] If I could even get there.

14:20.609 --> 14:21.735
It's at Seaside,

14:21.819 --> 14:24.989
and I just assumed
that Sweet Pea would give me a ride,

14:25.072 --> 14:27.533
but I didn't even get a chance to ask him.

14:28.617 --> 14:29.451
Sweet Pea?

14:30.995 --> 14:32.538
-Wait, are you guys--?
-No.

14:32.621 --> 14:35.040
I ended it,
so that I could focus on my music,

14:35.708 --> 14:37.042
which is what I always do.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.586
Stay focused.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.339
So much so that I've pushed everyone away.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.925
And I can't ask my mom for a ride,

14:45.009 --> 14:47.553
she doesn't even know
that I have this audition.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.222
Because if she knew,
and I didn't do well at it,

14:50.306 --> 14:52.558
she'd start asking me
about my backup plans,

14:52.641 --> 14:53.684
which I don't have.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.231
Let me take you.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.066
I got the jalopy.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.277
Really?
Absolutely.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.405
Just remember this moment,

15:06.488 --> 15:09.199
when you're accepting
your Best New Artist Grammy.

15:09.283 --> 15:10.117
Okay?

15:10.576 --> 15:11.577
Okay.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.124
[Reggie] What's up, Ronnie?

15:17.333 --> 15:18.334
We're dead.

15:18.626 --> 15:19.877
We're officially dead.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.379
That or we're about
to have our kneecaps broken.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.798
Courtesy of whoever this mystery buyer is.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.550
Does that really happen?

15:26.634 --> 15:30.721
I've combined my liquid funds
from Pop's and La Bonne Nuit.

15:30.804 --> 15:33.015
We're not even a quarter of the way there.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.184
Is robbing banks still a thing?

15:35.267 --> 15:38.938
Although the thought of being Bonnie
to your Clyde is intriguing...

15:40.439 --> 15:44.026
banks have round-the-clock
security guards with guns.

15:44.109 --> 15:47.321
But if they're anything
like my dad's lame-ass security guards...

15:47.780 --> 15:48.739
[sighs]

15:51.116 --> 15:52.826
Holy crap, I'm a genius.

15:52.910 --> 15:55.162
My dad keeps cash
in a safe at the dealership.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.914
Enough to make up the difference.

15:56.997 --> 16:00.000
I'm not gonna let you steal
from your own family.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.711
That dealership is my legacy,
so, technically,

16:02.795 --> 16:04.672
I'd borrow money from my future self.

16:04.755 --> 16:08.634
And everything's insured,
so, my dad will get a sweet payout,

16:08.717 --> 16:12.221
more than he deserves for all the shiners
he's given me over the years.

16:16.183 --> 16:17.393
This is lunacy.

16:20.270 --> 16:23.273
But it might be inspired lunacy.

16:26.151 --> 16:28.862
-How would we get it all done?
-My dad's security guard

16:28.946 --> 16:30.906
is only on duty at night after closing,

16:30.990 --> 16:35.369
so, I'd hit the lot during the day,
probably lunchtime,

16:35.661 --> 16:39.456
when my dad is usually at Pop's,
with a customer,

16:39.707 --> 16:42.292
trying to close a sale.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.336
You could wear a Gargoyle mask,

16:44.420 --> 16:45.838
so as not to get recognized.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.382
And I, of course, would come with you,

16:48.966 --> 16:50.843
as we're in this mess together.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.429
You can be my <i>Baby Driver.</i>

16:54.430 --> 16:56.932
Just, please, don't scratch my car.

16:57.474 --> 16:58.308
Okay?

17:07.818 --> 17:09.236
So, we all received letters,

17:09.319 --> 17:10.821
to finish Ascension Night.

17:10.904 --> 17:13.866
-This was taped to my trailer.
-Mine came to the dealership.

17:13.949 --> 17:16.035
Thought you caught the Gargoyle King, FP.

17:16.493 --> 17:19.329
Tall Boy was using the game
as a cover to deal drugs,

17:19.413 --> 17:23.167
but he wasn't the one setting up chalices
back when we were in high school.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.921
We're not really taking this seriously,
are we?

17:28.005 --> 17:31.091
We have to assume this is real,
if only for our kids' sake.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.886
And then what?
We leave them home alone all night,

17:33.969 --> 17:36.430
while we run around,
pretending to be teenagers?

17:36.513 --> 17:39.183
May I remind you
what happened last Ascension Night?

17:39.558 --> 17:40.768
Someone ended up dead.

17:41.351 --> 17:43.562
We don't have any choice in the matter.

17:43.645 --> 17:45.939
We all know why this is happening again,

17:46.023 --> 17:47.024
and now.

17:47.941 --> 17:52.071
Two members of the original Midnight Club
are daring to get married,

17:52.654 --> 17:53.697
to be happy.

17:53.781 --> 17:56.867
And the Gargoyle King,
whoever or whatever he is,

17:57.951 --> 17:59.078
wants to destroy that.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.789
He is a vicious and petty god.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.749
And if we don't finish the game now,

18:04.583 --> 18:07.211
the Gargoyle King is
never gonna leave us alone.

18:07.294 --> 18:09.713
Maybe if we do this,
we catch the son of a bitch.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.048
There's only one problem.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.843
The letter says
we all have to participate.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.472
I'll talk to Hiram.

18:18.555 --> 18:21.600
All right, it's settled, then.
We finish the game we started.

18:38.575 --> 18:39.618
[woman] Name?

18:40.786 --> 18:41.787
Josephine McCoy.
All right, then.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.501
Whenever you're ready.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.352
[gunshots]

19:15.863 --> 19:16.697
Go, go, go.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.243
Oh, my God, Reggie.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.494
-Were you shot?
-Yeah.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.622
I got the money,
but there was security after all.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.416
-Well, are you okay?
-Drive, drive.

19:32.838 --> 19:36.466
-[Cheryl] Thanks for your help, Toni.
-Just remember your promise to me.

19:36.800 --> 19:40.012
Don't worry, babe. I have a mega-plan,
and this is only step one.

19:43.724 --> 19:46.101
Operation Fifty Shades of Blackmail
is underway.
What in God's name
are you jezebels doing here?

19:58.363 --> 20:00.824
Whatever mad, sapphic caper you're on,

20:00.908 --> 20:03.827
I won't have you jeopardize
my thriving business.

20:03.911 --> 20:08.290
Step down from the Highsmith College Board
and revoke your ban on my admittance,

20:08.373 --> 20:11.335
or I'll go public with these photos
of your sorry clientele.

20:12.628 --> 20:16.173
I am far from ashamed of my work, Cheryl.

20:16.590 --> 20:21.261
Need I remind you
that blackmail is far more illegal

20:21.345 --> 20:23.555
than anything that goes on
at the Maple Club,

20:23.847 --> 20:25.474
all of which is consensual.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.309
[Toni] How will your clients feel,

20:27.392 --> 20:29.561
once we publish their names and photos?

20:30.187 --> 20:31.939
[Cheryl] Don't test us, Mumzie.

20:32.022 --> 20:34.524
We know how to dominate, too.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.611
[Archie] <i>Did it come through?</i>

20:37.694 --> 20:39.613
-[Josie] Um...
-[Archie] What does it say?

20:40.197 --> 20:42.616
"Unfortunately, we are...

20:44.409 --> 20:48.288
unable to invite you
to callbacks this year."

20:48.580 --> 20:49.581
I'm sorry, Josie.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.752
I know I'm biased, Archie,
but I think I killed that audition.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.630
I sang my heart out.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.591
And it still wasn't enough.

20:59.675 --> 21:00.842
Then they're crazy.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.304
-They don't deserve you.
-I've given so much to this.

21:05.514 --> 21:10.018
And all along, I've been saying,
"It's okay. It'll be worth it."

21:10.644 --> 21:13.981
I've built up so many walls
to focus on this one thing,

21:14.064 --> 21:14.898
and now...

21:17.067 --> 21:18.652
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

21:20.153 --> 21:21.154
And I'm alone.

21:22.114 --> 21:22.948
Hey.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.701
-You're not alone.
-I am.

21:25.784 --> 21:28.287
I can't even get a date
to my mom's wedding.

21:29.329 --> 21:31.623
-That speaks volumes.
-I'll do it.

21:32.457 --> 21:33.542
What, be my date?

21:34.668 --> 21:37.212
I've been alone these last few months.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.047
Either literally...

21:40.799 --> 21:43.677
or feeling like I'm from Mars,
and it sucks.

21:43.760 --> 21:44.594
Yeah.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.181
So, maybe I can help you
feel a little less alone.

21:48.849 --> 21:49.683
Okay.

21:50.183 --> 21:51.601
[Reggie] <i>I can't believe I was shot.</i>

21:51.685 --> 21:54.271
Are you sure
you don't wanna go to a doctor, Reggie?

21:54.521 --> 21:56.648
No, it's just a graze.

21:57.024 --> 22:00.110
Besides, now I can say I've been shot.

22:00.193 --> 22:03.113
Except you can't,
since we want everyone to believe

22:03.196 --> 22:06.033
that the Gargoyle Gang robbed
your father's dealership.

22:06.366 --> 22:07.617
Right, right.

22:09.828 --> 22:10.662
Okay.

22:11.747 --> 22:15.083
-Let's see how much money we just copped.
-And pray it's enough.

22:17.919 --> 22:19.212
[grunts]

22:20.047 --> 22:20.881
What?
A dye pack?

22:22.924 --> 22:23.800
Oh, hell.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.052
We're screwed.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.641
[school bell ringing]

22:35.687 --> 22:37.439
I did it. I told my dad.

22:37.981 --> 22:39.358
What? You did? How'd it go?

22:39.441 --> 22:44.112
He was quiet and weird at first,
but then okay, I think.

22:44.654 --> 22:47.824
We went to Pop's after,
got chicken pot pie, which is a good sign.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.911
I'm so proud of you, Moose.

22:50.994 --> 22:52.412
That mean you'll be my date?

22:52.829 --> 22:54.873
Yeah, and more importantly...

22:55.707 --> 22:57.959
we should do it, spend the night together.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.128
Question is, where?

23:01.129 --> 23:04.716
Don't worry. I know the perfect spot,
where no one will interrupt us.

23:07.094 --> 23:09.262
In a fortuitous turn of events,
Ms. Blossom,

23:09.346 --> 23:12.432
Highsmith College's policy
not to admit legacy candidates

23:12.516 --> 23:16.144
has been reconsidered,
so, we may proceed with our interview.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.854
Respectfully, Headmistress Patricia,

23:17.938 --> 23:20.732
I know you only perform a limited number
of one-on-ones.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.902
With my qualifications,
legacy status or not,

23:23.985 --> 23:25.362
I'm obviously a shoo-in.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.406
I'd like to cede my time

23:27.489 --> 23:30.117
to another
unquestionably worthy candidate.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.078
Ms. Antoinette Topaz.

23:33.578 --> 23:36.331
Future photojournalist,
and Nobel Peace Prize recipient.

23:36.915 --> 23:39.084
It's a pleasure to meet you, headmistress.

23:39.751 --> 23:42.838
Knock them dead, babe,
and remember, this is only step two.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.424
Yes. Please, have a seat.

23:46.550 --> 23:49.469
-Do you have your portfolio with you?
-[Toni] Yes, I do.

23:50.011 --> 23:51.721
Whoever you are, please, be chill.

23:59.855 --> 24:02.315
[The North Panics'
"Haven't You Heard?" playing]

24:06.111 --> 24:07.946
Oh, great. More teenagers.

24:13.118 --> 24:15.829
Here's your money,
or as much as we could get of it.

24:27.799 --> 24:29.426
Veronica Lodge, I presume.

24:30.177 --> 24:34.181
I can't believe your mom sent you out here
to sort out her mess.

24:34.848 --> 24:38.185
I mean, I know she's cutthroat,
but, man, that's cold as ice.

24:38.268 --> 24:40.145
Sorry, are we supposed to know you?

24:40.228 --> 24:41.563
I'm Gladys Jones.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.734
You might know my kid, Jughead.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.778
-What?
-Seriously?

24:48.862 --> 24:50.947
You're Jughead's mom?

24:51.031 --> 24:53.408
Mrs. Jones,
if you could give us more time,

24:53.492 --> 24:55.702
we could get you the rest of the money.

24:55.785 --> 24:57.370
Just don't break our kneecaps.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.376
I gotta say, I do admire the fact

25:03.460 --> 25:05.795
that you two came here,
knowing you were short.

25:05.879 --> 25:08.215
Shows you know how to take responsibility.

25:08.298 --> 25:09.466
Look at the two of you.

25:09.674 --> 25:10.634
[scoffs]

25:10.926 --> 25:13.512
You remind me a bit of me and FP,
back in the day.
I'll tell you what.
I'm sticking around for a while.

25:16.598 --> 25:19.935
So, I will take your money,
but I'm gonna have to charge you a fee,

25:20.143 --> 25:22.354
because I'm gonna need
to get it laundered...

25:22.854 --> 25:23.897
every which way.

25:23.980 --> 25:24.814
Understood.

25:25.273 --> 25:27.651
We'll figure out a payment plan
for the rest.

25:27.776 --> 25:30.695
But in exchange,
you're gonna lend me those sweet wheels.

25:32.447 --> 25:33.448
Not Bella.

25:34.366 --> 25:38.286
Please, Mrs. Jones, Reggie loves that car.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.705
I'll make sure
I take real good care of her.

25:41.122 --> 25:42.374
Oh, wait, one more thing.

25:42.457 --> 25:45.627
Just as a favor,
don't tell Jughead about our business.

25:46.461 --> 25:50.048
I mean, if you do,
I'm gonna have to tell Hiram

25:50.131 --> 25:52.926
about his missus going behind his back
for a cut,

25:53.718 --> 25:55.595
and that'd be bad for all of us.

[Cheryl] <i>Greetings, Moose.</i>

25:59.975 --> 26:01.977
What the hell, Cheryl? What do you want?

26:03.562 --> 26:05.438
To apologize.

26:06.273 --> 26:07.899
Outing you was wrong.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.986
For so many reasons.

26:12.112 --> 26:15.031
It's a personal decision
that I shouldn't have taken from you.

26:15.615 --> 26:16.658
I'm sorry.
Apology accepted.

26:23.415 --> 26:24.541
And that's step three.

26:24.833 --> 26:25.667
Bon appétit.

26:27.085 --> 26:28.128
Cheryl.

26:28.712 --> 26:32.340
I'm not saying what you did was right,
but it kind of turned out okay.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.426
I'm out to my dad.

26:38.263 --> 26:41.099
We're finally gonna do it.
Tonight in some secret bunker.

26:41.182 --> 26:43.018
Well, well, well, Moose.

26:43.268 --> 26:46.271
In that case, I'd bring a fresh set
of sheets, if I were you.

[FP] The Gargoyle King wants us
to finish Ascension Night.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.807
Better start by finding the chalices.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.684
Then we flip for our fates,

27:24.768 --> 27:26.019
and drink up, game over.

-You want us to drink poison?
-[Sierra] Not quite.

Let's get these chalices,
get this over with.

27:54.964 --> 27:57.801
-Should we wait for the Lodges?
-We're already here, Sierra.

27:57.884 --> 28:00.512
Friends, good to see you again.

28:00.595 --> 28:02.639
I'm certain
not all of you feel the same way.

28:02.722 --> 28:05.183
I sure as hell don't,
but we're here on a mission,

28:05.266 --> 28:06.726

Yeah, we did. Nothing.

I made it a quest.

The Gargoyle King told them
their brothers needed help.

"When you are weak, I am weak."

about my inclinations,

they sent me to the Sisters
to get help for my...

33:40.226 --> 33:42.145

33:42.478 --> 33:45.356
<i>and where I started playing</i>
<i>Gryphons and Gargoyles,</i>

33:45.565 --> 33:49.694
<i>which I later learned Tommy played, too,</i>
<i>with his Midnight Club.</i>

33:50.611 --> 33:53.614
<i>The Sisters cured me of impure thoughts.</i>

33:53.990 --> 33:55.491

33:55.867 --> 33:59.370
as I have been all these years.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.667
But then I heard Tom
and Sierra were getting married,

34:04.751 --> 34:09.797
just as my own son, Moose,
told me he was seeing Tom's boy.

Well, after everything
that Kevin and Moose just went through,

38:00.653 --> 38:04.365
Moose, your friends are here and I'm here,
and you can live with any of us.

38:04.448 --> 38:05.283
Kevin.

38:05.741 --> 38:06.575
Hey.

38:08.369 --> 38:10.204
I can't live here.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.749
At least not for a little while.

38:29.432 --> 38:30.558
I'll miss you, Marmaduke.

38:31.559 --> 38:32.977
I'll miss you, Kevin Keller.

38:53.914 --> 38:56.208
It's so messed up, what Major Mason did.

38:56.292 --> 38:59.378
It was the Sisters' conversion therapy.
It twisted his soul.

39:00.504 --> 39:03.549
Well, I'm glad we got you
out of that hellhole when we did.

39:03.841 --> 39:06.218
I'll never forget the day you saved me,
Tee-Tee.

39:06.510 --> 39:10.222
And since you've done so much for me,
I wanted to do something for you.

39:10.890 --> 39:12.558
Call it step four.

39:17.271 --> 39:18.272
What's this?

39:19.315 --> 39:21.233
[Cheryl] A gang, if you want it.

39:21.317 --> 39:24.195
You said you were missing
having the Serpents as a family.

39:24.278 --> 39:26.947
I found some other girls
who were looking for support,

39:27.031 --> 39:28.032
or community,

39:28.115 --> 39:30.785
or just good old-fashioned fisticuffs.

39:31.202 --> 39:35.998
And I thought
maybe we could start a new family.

39:40.711 --> 39:45.174
Cheryl, this is the most badass
and romantic thing you've ever done.

39:46.967 --> 39:49.929
[clearing throat]
Uh... Do we have a name yet?

39:50.346 --> 39:52.014
How about...

39:54.183 --> 39:56.185
the Pretty Poisons?
Pretty by day, poison by night.

40:00.898 --> 40:01.899
I love it.

40:03.067 --> 40:05.194
-You said you have an update for me?
-Yeah.

40:05.277 --> 40:06.404
But first...

40:07.113 --> 40:10.408
You could've told us
that the secret buyer was Jughead's Mom.

40:11.867 --> 40:13.869
Wait. Gladys showed up?

40:15.287 --> 40:18.749
I assumed that she would've sent
one of her deputies up from Toledo.

40:18.833 --> 40:19.667
Nope.

40:20.167 --> 40:21.502
And about Toledo, Mom?

40:22.795 --> 40:23.921
I've got news for you.

40:24.880 --> 40:27.591
I don't think Gladys is leaving
anytime soon.

40:30.344 --> 40:34.181
Everything's going how you said, Mom.
Dad's wrapped around my pinky.

40:35.141 --> 40:36.475
You're his weakness, baby.

40:38.018 --> 40:41.814
Which means we got the whole town, JB.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.733
Your old man's the sheriff.

40:45.359 --> 40:47.528
The mayor owes us serious cash.

40:47.611 --> 40:50.072
Hell, even her daughter's
working for me now.

40:50.156 --> 40:51.157
Oh, yeah.

40:52.366 --> 40:54.660
We moved to the right place
at the right time.

40:54.785 --> 40:55.786
I could feel it.

40:57.288 --> 41:00.416
<i>♪ Where ♪</i>

41:00.791 --> 41:04.378
<i>♪ Where do we belong? ♪</i>

41:11.260 --> 41:12.094
Archie.
