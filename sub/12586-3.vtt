WEBVTT

00:35.326 --> 00:37.996
-This is definitely my good side.

00:38.079 --> 00:43.585
The cheekbone, the eyebrow,
it all comes together nicely.

00:43.668 --> 00:46.463
This side, I’m all chin.

00:46.629 --> 00:47.964
-

00:49.883 --> 00:50.717
Uh.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.926
Hey, guys.

00:52.010 --> 00:55.472
Don’t we all do weird things when we think
no one’s watching?

00:55.555 --> 00:57.682
-Well, I’ll be going now!
-Get him!

01:10.403 --> 01:11.571
I want to live!

01:12.489 --> 01:13.323


01:13.406 --> 01:15.992
-You’re right. He is funny.
Told ya.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.619
"I want to live."

01:17.702 --> 01:18.953
Good one, Bobby.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.330
Huh?

01:20.413 --> 01:24.167
Bobby Hill, we want you to be
a powder-puff cheerleader with us.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.543
Here’s your pom-poms.

01:27.337 --> 01:30.131
We got spirit, how about you?

01:34.969 --> 01:36.137
-It’s gonna be a test of...

01:36.221 --> 01:38.139
...will and strength to have fake boobs

01:38.223 --> 01:40.266
and not be touching them all the time.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.144
I don’t see what’s funny
about powder-puff.

01:43.228 --> 01:48.066
The girls playing football, the football
players in skirts cheering them on.

01:48.149 --> 01:48.983
Eh!

01:49.067 --> 01:50.777
Maybe you’re not getting the joke.

01:50.902 --> 01:54.197
We get to dress like girls
and act like girls.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.323
It’s funny.

01:55.406 --> 01:58.952

"Hi, Bobby! I’m gonna make you a roast."

01:59.953 --> 02:00.829
Roast.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.206
Cross-dressing’s been done, Joseph.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.500
I know I had a prop-comedy phase.

02:05.583 --> 02:06.835
But I’ve grown.

02:06.918 --> 02:09.170
I’ve been watching reruns of "Seinfeld."

02:09.254 --> 02:12.590
And I’m impressed
with the observational humor.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.093
That’s where my comedy is now.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.220
Hill! Two-man huddle! Let’s go!

02:17.971 --> 02:19.305
Okay.

02:21.307 --> 02:25.019
I hear your jokes and bits and sketches
are hilarious!

02:25.103 --> 02:27.564
They had better be.
I got a losing football program.

02:27.647 --> 02:31.818
And the only thing that’s going to save
my bacon is a good powder-puff game.

02:31.901 --> 02:35.488
Yeah. But isn’t powder-puff
about girls playing football?

02:35.572 --> 02:37.490
Nobody watches the girls!

02:37.574 --> 02:40.076
It’s all about you boys
and your tom-fooligans!

02:40.160 --> 02:43.746
Mess this up and I’ll be back teaching
math to the slowpokes!

02:44.789 --> 02:45.790
Break!

02:50.003 --> 02:51.045
Have you seen this?

02:51.129 --> 02:53.882
Yeah. PTA having another fundraiser.

02:53.965 --> 02:57.343
If you don’t give them money,
they threaten you with volunteering job.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.762
Swipe credit card, avoid conflict.

02:59.846 --> 03:00.763
Oh no.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.348
This time I am calling their bluff.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.143
I’m gonna go to one of those meetings
and volunteer.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.812
Yeah, my time worth more than that.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.564
Well, mine is not.

03:10.648 --> 03:13.484
Isn’t the word "carburetor" redundant

03:13.651 --> 03:15.653
since it already has the word "car" in it?

03:15.737 --> 03:17.989
Shouldn’t they just be called "buretors"?

03:18.072 --> 03:21.159
-Well, actually, Bill, the word comes...
-Hey, everybody!

03:21.242 --> 03:25.788
Guess whose star-athlete son has been
selected for powder-puff cheerleading?

03:25.872 --> 03:29.375
My son! Joseph Gribble was chosen.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.922
Dale, we were in the middle
of an important conversation.

03:34.005 --> 03:34.839
Yeah, Dale.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.342
Hank doesn’t want to talk
about powder-puff football.

03:37.425 --> 03:39.219
He wants to talk about "buretors".

03:39.302 --> 03:41.846
Maybe we could just stand quietly.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.350
That’s fine.
I’ll just carry on an internal dialogue.

03:50.021 --> 03:52.106
Yes!

03:55.860 --> 03:57.278
Is this the PTA meeting?

03:57.403 --> 03:59.864
-I’m so glad I’m not late.
-Oh, but you are.

03:59.948 --> 04:04.077
We take our first break after 20 minutes.
It gets pretty intense.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.246
-People need a macaroon.
-I see.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.081
We avoid a lot of tears this way.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.500
But you should feel free
to cry on my shoulder,

04:10.583 --> 04:11.834
or any other body part you want.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.879
Well, oh...

04:15.505 --> 04:16.589
Excuse me.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.717
-But aren’t you...
-Yes! PJ Finster.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.261
Hun Chin Ko’s dad.

04:22.387 --> 04:23.846
-Time!
-All right.

04:24.472 --> 04:26.808
And don’t forget to bring up
the bake sale.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.146
I now call this meeting back to order.

04:34.232 --> 04:39.487
I’d like to propose an allocation of funds
to pay for more janitorial supplies.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.990
They’ve been cleaning
with just water for a week.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.992
We finished new business before the break.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.159
Okay.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.911
But there’s a stickiness issue.

04:46.995 --> 04:50.957
Carl, I left a high-powered law firm
to spend time with my family.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.876
And I’m giving up time with my family
to be here.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.338
If you want to talk stickiness, put your
hand on the kitchen counter at my house.

04:58.464 --> 04:59.299
Well put.

04:59.382 --> 05:02.802
Ah. Excuse me. I’m new here. Peggy Hill!

05:02.885 --> 05:06.431
Now, those animal soap carvings
the kids make in art class,

05:06.514 --> 05:09.267
what if we repurpose those?

05:09.350 --> 05:10.685
Nobody likes them anyway.

05:10.768 --> 05:12.937
You know, normally I shun newcomers.

05:13.021 --> 05:17.775
But that kind of out-of-the-box thinking
is gonna get you on the PTA fast track.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.110
You get me.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.530
It’d just be a shame to throw it out.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.449
It’s only 15 years old.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.284
Hey, Bobby.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.621
You’re not gonna believe
what happened to me today.

05:30.705 --> 05:33.750
I got picked for powder-puff cheerleading.

05:34.584 --> 05:35.418
Don’t worry.

05:35.501 --> 05:38.129
I’ve got some great ideas
about how to get out of it.

05:38.212 --> 05:41.841
They can’t make me cheer
if they think I have lockjaw.

05:41.924 --> 05:44.469
Huh? What do you think, Dad?

05:45.345 --> 05:48.181
I can’t believe you got picked
for powder-puff!

05:48.264 --> 05:51.768
Well, that’s an honor usually reserved
for football players.

05:51.851 --> 05:52.894
This is great!

05:52.977 --> 05:53.895
What?

05:53.978 --> 05:57.482
I’m so happy for you, Hank!
And you too, Bobby!

05:57.565 --> 06:00.568
Good things don’t usually happen
to the un-athletic.

06:00.651 --> 06:03.946
Bobby, I had given up hope
of you ever making a team.

06:04.030 --> 06:08.743
But this is finally a chance to be part
of a time-honored football tradition.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.119
Uh-huh.

06:10.203 --> 06:14.749
So you want me to dress up like a girl
and run around with pom-poms?

06:14.832 --> 06:15.750
Yes.

06:15.833 --> 06:19.295
Hey, remember when I "gave birth"
to a football?

06:20.380 --> 06:25.259
Yeah. And we wrapped it in a baby blanket
and kicked it through the goal post.

06:25.343 --> 06:28.054
I understand you think it’s great and all.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.890
But comedy is very subjective.

06:30.973 --> 06:32.475
And men in drag?

06:32.558 --> 06:36.896
Well, I’m sorry, Dad,
but it just isn’t my thing.

06:37.772 --> 06:39.023
It is now, Bobby.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.234
Because you’re gonna be a cheerleader.

06:41.317 --> 06:43.569
Now, let’s go find you a dress!

06:49.909 --> 06:52.578
Bobby, you can’t throw a rock
at a Rotary Club meeting

06:52.662 --> 06:53.996
without hitting a former...

06:54.080 --> 06:55.248
...powder-puff cheerleader.

06:55.331 --> 06:57.959
Tom Hutto down at AAA, powder-puff.

06:58.042 --> 07:01.045
David McDavid at Wide Track Motors,
powder-puff.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.382
Bob Decker from Centex Escrow,
powder-puff.

07:04.465 --> 07:05.466
Great.

07:05.550 --> 07:08.970
Now, the kind of brassiere you choose
as a cheerleader

07:09.053 --> 07:11.472
will determine your cheer personality.

07:11.556 --> 07:15.560
Are you the fun-loving buxom one?
Or the flat-chested brainiac?

07:18.187 --> 07:19.772
This one, I guess.

07:19.856 --> 07:20.815
Good choice.

07:23.359 --> 07:24.527
Now...

07:24.694 --> 07:25.778
...let’s get you made up.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.623
Run!

07:37.707 --> 07:39.959
Okay, team, let’s go!

07:40.042 --> 07:41.210
Over here! Over here!

07:41.294 --> 07:42.295
Together!

07:42.420 --> 07:43.921
Run!

07:44.964 --> 07:47.091
-Go, Longhorns!
-Hey, cheerleaders!

07:48.259 --> 07:51.721
That doesn’t look like flouncing
and bouncing to me!

07:56.684 --> 07:58.561
You’re in over your head, Kleehammer.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.063
Hill!

08:01.147 --> 08:02.482
Comedy bow-wow!

08:02.565 --> 08:04.275
Cherry picker now!

08:07.904 --> 08:08.946
Hill!

08:09.030 --> 08:12.200
What do you think of all the boys
blowing kisses to the crowd

08:12.283 --> 08:14.118
like a gaggle of beauty queens?

08:14.202 --> 08:15.953
It’s fine, I guess.

08:16.037 --> 08:20.583
All right, boys! Get in line and blow
kisses till your arms turn to jelly!

08:20.666 --> 08:22.335
Hill says it’s funny!

08:22.418 --> 08:25.463
-Coach. Coach.
-Not now, Beth.

08:25.546 --> 08:28.549
All right, pucker, smooch, and blow!

08:33.012 --> 08:34.096
Kiss!

08:34.180 --> 08:36.682
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

08:38.726 --> 08:40.144
Alexis.

08:40.228 --> 08:43.064
I’ve noticed
that there are 41 PTA committees.

08:43.147 --> 08:44.732
I believe they can be condensed...

08:44.815 --> 08:45.900
...into a fewer number.

08:45.983 --> 08:49.820
My estimate is ten
but my guesstimate is six.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.697
Great thinking, Peggy.

08:51.781 --> 08:54.784
Sounds like a project for you, me, and PJ.

08:54.867 --> 08:55.701
Yay!

08:55.785 --> 08:57.995
I’ll call home and have Lima
start the kids’ homework.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.789
This might take a good long while.

08:59.872 --> 09:00.831
But I made a choice.

09:00.915 --> 09:02.208
I stand by it.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.793
And I have no regrets.

09:03.876 --> 09:08.381
I hope one of you brought a sleeping bag
big enough for two, or more.

09:13.469 --> 09:17.390
Then we practiced popping
each other’s boob balloons.

09:17.473 --> 09:21.394
And then we practiced popping
each other’s butt balloons.

09:21.477 --> 09:23.813
You’re doing balloon work already?

09:23.896 --> 09:26.774
Well, I’m sure Coach Kleehammer
knows what he’s doing.

09:26.857 --> 09:29.193
You know what would make
your outfit perfect?

09:29.277 --> 09:30.903
My old striped tube top.

09:32.321 --> 09:34.699
I am not wearing Mom’s clothes!

09:34.782 --> 09:38.953
Look, Dad, this just isn’t working for me.
I hate it!

09:40.037 --> 09:44.709
Fine. If you can’t see how important
this is, then go ahead and quit.

09:44.792 --> 09:45.960
I’m free?

09:46.043 --> 09:47.128
This is great!

09:47.211 --> 09:48.421
Well, we’ll see.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.339
When you’re face to face
with your teammates,

09:50.423 --> 09:52.466
it might not be so easy to quit.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.593
Are you kidding?

09:53.676 --> 09:55.928
I’ve quit more things than you’ve started.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.519
Gribble, you call that demure?

10:03.603 --> 10:05.980
I, I don’t know what that means, sir.

10:06.063 --> 10:07.940
When I say bat your eyelashes...

10:08.024 --> 10:09.275
...I mean bat them!

10:09.358 --> 10:10.443
Okay, now watch.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.777
This is where Hill comes in.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.988
See? He’s created a character.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.741
The exasperated bobbysoxer.

10:16.824 --> 10:17.700
Princess.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.410
Now, that’s funny!

10:21.829 --> 10:25.291
Actually, guys,
I’ve got something to tell you.

10:25.374 --> 10:28.002
Everybody listen up!
Hill’s got something to tell us!

10:28.085 --> 10:29.962
Yeah, the thing is...

10:30.046 --> 10:31.047
He’s continuing.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.466
I needed to tell you guys that...

10:33.549 --> 10:36.636
Anything. Anything at all you can say
to help these boys?

10:46.854 --> 10:51.942
First of all, Kurt, your pantyhose
should be darker and baggier.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.695
And Eric, you shouldn’t wear
pantyhose at all.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.781
You’ve got hairy legs in middle school.

10:56.864 --> 10:58.115
Don’t waste that.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.826
We’re gonna need props.

11:03.996 --> 11:07.166
<i>♪ Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind ♪</i>

11:07.249 --> 11:09.502
<i>♪ Hey Mickey, hey Mickey ♪</i>

11:10.294 --> 11:13.464
<i>♪ Oh Mickey, you're so fine
You're so fine, you blow my mind ♪</i>

11:13.547 --> 11:14.465
<i>♪ Hey Mickey ♪</i>

11:16.801 --> 11:19.637
<i>♪ Oh Mickey, what a pity,
you don't understand ♪</i>

11:19.720 --> 11:22.890
<i>♪ You take me by the heart
when you take me by the hand ♪</i>

11:23.099 --> 11:26.102
<i>♪ Oh Mickey, you're so pretty,
can't you understand? ♪</i>

11:26.310 --> 11:28.396
<i>♪ It's guys like you, Mickey ♪</i>

11:29.063 --> 11:33.150
<i>♪ Ooh what you do Mickey, do Mickey
Don't break my heart, Mickey ♪</i>

11:42.159 --> 11:43.494
So how’d they take it?

11:43.577 --> 11:45.913
Well, they took it pretty good...

11:45.996 --> 11:48.332
...because I’m staying.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.252
I knew you couldn’t let them down.

11:51.335 --> 11:54.130
Thanks for making me dress up
like a girl, Dad.

11:56.257 --> 11:59.760
You know that after this is over,
you can’t do this anymore, right?

11:59.844 --> 12:00.678
Oh, I know.

12:02.596 --> 12:03.723
Meeting adjourned.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.728
So, congratulations, Peggy.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.272
Your restructuring proposal passed
with flying colors.

12:11.355 --> 12:12.189
Thank you.

12:12.273 --> 12:15.192
I’m just glad I got through my argument
before all the whooping

12:15.276 --> 12:17.486
from the powder-puff cheerleading
practice started.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.196
What is going on out there exactly?

12:19.280 --> 12:20.948
Could you explain it to me in detail?

12:21.031 --> 12:23.951
If I have to miss Circle Time
at Kidnasium, so be it.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.495
Well, it’s an annual football game.

12:26.579 --> 12:30.249
But the girls are the players
and the cheerleaders are the boys.

12:30.332 --> 12:33.043
They wear makeup and wigs and act silly.

12:33.127 --> 12:36.464
Boys are making fun of girls?

12:36.547 --> 12:37.840
Yes.

12:37.923 --> 12:40.926
You know, my son Bobby is actually kind of
the head cheerleader.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.094
Mm-hm.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.973
He keeps knocking over lamps around
the house with his big, clumsy boobs.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.392
That kind of mockery does untold damage

12:48.517 --> 12:51.270
to a young girl’s fragile psyche.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.272
My daughter was hysterical recently

12:53.355 --> 12:57.193
when an eighth-grade boy told her her
ponytail looked like a piece of doodie.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.028
Thank God I was home to console her!

12:59.111 --> 13:00.946
Which was my choice,
stand by it, no regrets.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.448
Well, that’s terrible.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.700
Have you tried putting her hair up
in a bun?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.660
No, no. That could look like poop too.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.955
See, it starts out innocently
with a boy teasing a girl.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.625
Then that same boy dresses
like a cheerleader.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.919
Then little Mary Jo Honor Student

13:15.002 --> 13:17.588
is having her buttocks slapped
in a rap video!

13:17.671 --> 13:21.759
That is the saddest hypothetical story
I have ever heard.

13:21.842 --> 13:24.094
But powder-puff is all just in fun.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.013
So was pouring pigs’ blood on Carrie.

13:26.096 --> 13:27.473
Poor girl had to kill everyone.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.061
I will not let that happen.

13:34.104 --> 13:35.815
Lima, I’ll be home late.

13:35.898 --> 13:38.317
I have another fire to put out.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.361
Ready! Okay!

13:40.444 --> 13:43.030
We’re red hot and can’t be stopped.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.741
We’re red hot and can’t be stopped.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.159
I love that cheer.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.703
But seriously, you have to stop.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.413
What’s going on down there?

13:51.497 --> 13:54.124
Boys, this here’s the PTA president.

13:54.208 --> 13:57.127
And she’s making me call off
the cheerleading part of things.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.754
-What?
-That’s not fair.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.214
But I’m so pretty!

14:00.297 --> 14:02.007
Why is this happening, Mom?

14:03.300 --> 14:07.680
Sometimes things that are funny
to everybody are not really funny at all.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.932
You can’t take this away from us!

14:10.015 --> 14:11.600
You just can’t!

14:11.684 --> 14:13.018
Sorry, boys.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.197
I guess I won’t be needing this anymore.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.157
I guess not.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.494
Hello, Peggy.

14:30.578 --> 14:31.579
Hello, Hank.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.205
Hello, Mom!

14:34.540 --> 14:38.669
So what else did you destroy today
besides powder-puff football?

14:38.752 --> 14:40.713
Actually, class favorites.

14:40.796 --> 14:43.632
And, technically, the powder-puff game
is still going on.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.093
Maybe the girls will play well
for the first time ever

14:46.176 --> 14:49.096
since they won’t have anyone
on the sidelines making fun of them.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.348
Those boys weren’t making fun of anyone.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.518
They were just doing
what powder-puff cheerleaders do.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.897
So you won’t be offended
if I stuff a sock in my jeans

14:57.980 --> 14:59.523
and strut around the neighborhood?

14:59.607 --> 15:01.317
That would be hilarious!

15:01.400 --> 15:02.735
Do it, Mom! Do it!

15:02.818 --> 15:05.821
No! I am not gonna do it!
And neither are you!

15:14.580 --> 15:15.414
Dangit, Carl.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.250
These boys weren’t hurting a soul
and you know it.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.210
You’ve got to do something about this.

15:20.294 --> 15:23.923
If you’re asking me to go up
against the PTA, the answer is no.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.216
I’m not walking into that buzz saw.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.970
You can’t just sit back
and watch this great tradition die.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.476
All right, you didn’t hear this from me.

15:35.559 --> 15:37.394
But PTA’s a democracy, Hank.

15:37.478 --> 15:38.395
You’re a parent.

15:38.479 --> 15:41.148
You bring a motion to the floor
and you get the votes,

15:41.231 --> 15:42.983
you can bring the cheerleaders back.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.235
Democracy in action.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.154
The answer was there all along.

15:47.237 --> 15:49.239
The beauty of it is, it’s not on me.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.575
Well, I got to go
to the geography classroom.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.702
Some kid drew groin on Florida.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.165
All those in favor?

16:02.086 --> 16:03.921
Motion to turn the air on is accepted.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.424
That completes new business.

16:07.508 --> 16:08.592
Wait.

16:08.676 --> 16:09.718
I have a motion...

16:09.802 --> 16:11.136
...I’d like to bring to the floor.

16:11.845 --> 16:14.473
Reluctantly, the chair allows.

16:17.935 --> 16:22.481
Powder-puff cheerleading has been
a grand and often hilarious tradition

16:22.564 --> 16:25.734
in Tom Landry Middle School athletics.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.946
You’ll notice how much fun
all these kids are having.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.705
I don’t see anyone who looks offended.

16:37.788 --> 16:40.374
Look. They’re all having
the time of their lives.

16:40.457 --> 16:41.709
The time of their lives!

16:43.377 --> 16:46.630
What’s really offensive is watching
those girls play football!

16:47.464 --> 16:49.633
You’re really not helping, Coach.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.553
In summation, powder-puff cheerleading

16:52.636 --> 16:54.888
is a way for these boys to have some fun,

16:54.972 --> 16:59.643
make people laugh, and create friendships
that will last a lifetime.

17:00.686 --> 17:01.729
It’s true.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.106
I think these men make a good point.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.608
Maybe we should reconsider
our stance on this.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.901
I can’t do that.

17:07.985 --> 17:11.488
It would undermine my leadership.
I can’t risk all this.

17:13.157 --> 17:17.661
What’s "all this?" Staying here all night
when we could be home with our families?

17:20.748 --> 17:21.749
Peggy...

17:23.250 --> 17:27.421
...you are interfering with procedure
and gavel handling!

17:27.504 --> 17:29.840
I support Mister Hill’s motion.

17:31.008 --> 17:32.760
This isn’t about ridicule.

17:32.843 --> 17:35.095
It’s about freedom of expression.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.431
Girls should be able to play football

17:37.514 --> 17:42.519
and boys should be able to put on skirts
and wigs and cheer their hearts out.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.354
Gay men should be able...

17:44.438 --> 17:45.731
...to come out of the closet

17:45.814 --> 17:49.401
and be openly and unapologetically gay.

17:49.485 --> 17:52.738
And working mothers should be able
to go back to work

17:52.821 --> 17:56.116
if that is what they really want.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.327
Who’s gay in the PTA?

17:58.410 --> 17:59.578
Spicy!

17:59.661 --> 18:02.539
Ladies and gentlemen,
parents and teachers,

18:02.623 --> 18:06.251
I move to reinstate
the powder-puff cheerleaders!

18:06.335 --> 18:07.669
Is there a second?

18:07.753 --> 18:09.505
-I second.
-Hey-hey-hey!

18:10.297 --> 18:11.298
Sorry.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.133
That’s how we second a motion
in the gun club.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.094
Show of hands. All those in favor.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.430
Opposed.

18:21.266 --> 18:24.353
A tie. Carl, you know how this works.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.605
The principal’s vote breaks any ties.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.066
So what’s it gonna be?

18:37.866 --> 18:41.370
Huh! Uh! Oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.289
Ah, Carl.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.624
Sorry, Hank.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.417
Motion fails to pass!

19:01.181 --> 19:04.852
You know, if this was a movie,
we’d get to be cheerleaders again.

19:04.935 --> 19:07.146
And Kurt Russell would be my dad!

19:07.229 --> 19:10.357
We’re gonna find a way to fight this.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.025
I don’t know about you,

19:12.109 --> 19:16.905
but my pantyhose came three to a pack
and I plan on using all three!

19:22.744 --> 19:23.662
Here!

19:23.745 --> 19:24.913
Run!

19:25.956 --> 19:27.374
Hey.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.711
Hey, this isn’t my fault.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.796
Hey, get off me!

19:37.968 --> 19:39.553
Blue 32!

19:39.636 --> 19:42.055
Blue 32, hike! Run!

19:45.809 --> 19:48.103
Come on, you guys! Get it together!

20:01.074 --> 20:02.910
Ready? Okay!

20:02.993 --> 20:05.037
"Shake it but don’t break it.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.747
Took your mama nine months to make it!"

20:06.830 --> 20:07.831
I said...

20:07.915 --> 20:09.499
"Shake it but don’t break it.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.335
Took your mama nine months to make it!"

20:11.418 --> 20:12.252
I said...

20:12.336 --> 20:13.921
-Thank you, sweet Jesus.
-Whoo-hoo.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.547
Yeah, whoo.

20:16.965 --> 20:19.176
Look, Bobby’s rallying his troops.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.093
Whoo-hoo.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.261
Ah-ha-ha.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.847
And hey.
He’s starting a fake catfight.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.767
And Joseph’s storming off.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.727
My son’s a diva!

20:28.810 --> 20:30.646
You can’t do this! It’s been banned!

20:30.729 --> 20:31.855
What’s been banned?

20:31.939 --> 20:36.652
We’re just fans of powder-puff football
who happen to be cross-dressers!

20:36.735 --> 20:40.072
Or does the PTA have some problem
with cross-dressing?

20:40.155 --> 20:41.490
No, no! Of course not!

20:41.573 --> 20:44.243
Transvestite and transgender individuals
are protected

20:44.326 --> 20:46.036
when participating in public activity.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.790
-Ooh, yeah
-I love that.

20:49.873 --> 20:52.292
I’m having a contraction!

20:54.503 --> 20:57.422
It’s a bouncing baby ball!

20:57.589 --> 20:59.007
Way to go, guys.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.217
-Let me through.
-...enjoy that.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.678
Shh. It’s okay.

21:03.762 --> 21:04.888
Look, Hank.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.808
Have you ever seen
such a beautifully punted baby?

21:07.891 --> 21:10.435
Well, that sure does bring back memories.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.980
We’re red hot and can’t be stopped.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.816
We’re red hot and can’t be stopped.

21:15.899 --> 21:18.277
We’re red hot and can’t be stopped.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.988
We’re red hot and can’t be stopped.

21:54.521 --> 21:55.856
-<i>But I’m so pretty!</i>
