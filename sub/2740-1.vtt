<i>A land of harmony and hope.</i>

00:50.217 --> 00:52.549
<i>This is our land.</i>

<i>Oceania.</i>

<i>These are our people.</i>

01:00.961 --> 01:05.193
<i>The workers, the strivers, the builders.</i>

01:09.603 --> 01:12.003
<i>These are our people.</i>

01:12.839 --> 01:16.673
<i>The builders of our world, struggling...</i>

01:17.210 --> 01:19.906
<i>fighting, bleeding...</i>

01:21.148 --> 01:22.581
<i>dying.</i>

01:22.983 --> 01:27.283
<i>On the streets of our cities
and on the far-flung battlefields.</i>

01:28.088 --> 01:31.353
<i>Fighting against the mutilation
of our hopes and dreams.</i>

01:37.197 --> 01:38.630
<i>Who are they?</i>

01:39.432 --> 01:42.333
<i>Eurasia! Eurasia!</i>

01:44.104 --> 01:46.368
<i>They are the dark armies.</i>

01:48.041 --> 01:51.238
<i>The dark, murdering armies of Eurasia.</i>

01:53.713 --> 01:56.614
<i>In the barren deserts of Africa and India...</i>

01:57.017 --> 01:58.985
<i>on the oceans of Australasia...</i>

01:59.085 --> 02:02.543
<i>courage, strength, and youth are sacrificed.</i>

02:03.323 --> 02:08.192
<i>Sacrificed to barbarians,
whose only honor is atrocity.</i>

02:13.733 --> 02:16.133
<i>But even as we grasp at victory...</i>

02:16.469 --> 02:19.302
<i>there is a cancer, an evil tumor...</i>

02:19.873 --> 02:23.274
<i>growing, spreading in our midst.</i>

02:24.110 --> 02:26.772
<i>Shout, shout...</i>

02:26.947 --> 02:28.812

02:29.182 --> 02:31.207
Goldstein!

02:34.721 --> 02:37.451
<i>Nothing the Party says is true.</i>

02:37.891 --> 02:40.359
<i>Nothing the Party does is good.</i>

02:41.328 --> 02:43.922
<i>Even the war itself isn't real.</i>

02:45.265 --> 02:47.927
<i>The Party wants you to believe
we are at war...</i>

02:48.034 --> 02:52.095
<i>so as to channel your aggressions
away from their rightful target...</i>

02:52.205 --> 02:53.536
<i>the Party.</i>

02:55.008 --> 02:56.771
<i>Big Brother is not real.</i>

02:58.144 --> 03:00.942
<i>He is pure fiction, created by the Party.</i>

03:01.648 --> 03:03.809
<i>The real rulers of the State...</i>

03:03.917 --> 03:06.977
<i>are unknown, faceless manipulators...</i>

03:07.087 --> 03:09.214
<i>who, because they are not known...</i>

03:09.322 --> 03:12.814
<i>are able to wield power
without let or hindrance.</i>

03:14.361 --> 03:18.229
<i>People of Oceania, you are being duped.</i>

03:19.199 --> 03:22.566
<i>The Party doesn't serve the people,
it serves itself.</i>

03:23.136 --> 03:25.434
<i>We are not at war with Eurasia.</i>

03:26.539 --> 03:29.337
Death! Death! Traitor!

03:30.877 --> 03:33.277
<i>You are being made into obedient...</i>

03:33.380 --> 03:36.213
<i>stupid slaves of the Party.</i>

03:37.384 --> 03:39.284
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

03:39.753 --> 03:42.381
<i>See the evil that is happening to you.</i>

03:43.056 --> 03:46.150
<i>The Party drops bombs on its own citizens.</i>

03:46.259 --> 03:47.226
Traitor!

03:47.327 --> 03:50.854
<i>It is the Party, not the Eurasians,
who are our enemies.</i>

03:52.666 --> 03:53.894
<i>Rise up.</i>

03:54.434 --> 03:56.163
<i>Throw off the yoke.</i>

03:56.670 --> 04:01.164
<i>You have nothing to lose,
and everything to gain.</i>

04:02.309 --> 04:04.573
<i>People of Oceania.</i>

04:35.141 --> 04:36.301
<i>Big, Big, Big....</i>

05:50.283 --> 05:52.308
<i>Innuendo, deleted.</i>

05:53.553 --> 05:55.953
<i>Intransigence, rendered as crime.</i>

05:57.357 --> 05:58.346
<i>Inversion....</i>

07:10.263 --> 07:11.730
Back, Day One.

07:27.247 --> 07:31.308
<i>Ref. Times 1 4-2-84, Page 3,

<i>"Miniprod Forecasts Increase

07:35.488 --> 07:38.252
<i>"from 20 to 25 Grams Per Week."</i>

07:56.409 --> 08:00.175
<i>I confess to spreading the rumor,
on orders from Goldstein...</i>

08:00.847 --> 08:04.374
<i>that the war is not really with Eurasia,
but with Eastasia.</i>

08:05.351 --> 08:09.754
<i>That, for years, in fact since the days
of our glorious Revolution...</i>

08:09.856 --> 08:11.983
<i>I had no faith in our future.</i>

08:13.126 --> 08:16.493
<i>I forged government announcements
and falsified figures...</i>

08:16.596 --> 08:19.827
<i>quoted for agricultural
and industrial production.</i>

08:20.633 --> 08:25.536
<i>As a result of mental disturbance from
my experiences during the atomic wars...</i>

08:26.372 --> 08:29.739
<i>I was a willing subject
of Goldstein's influence.</i>

08:30.577 --> 08:32.977
<i>I was stubborn and egocentric.</i>

08:33.078 --> 08:36.640
<i>When ownlife thoughts occurred to me,
I reveled in them.</i>

08:36.883 --> 08:39.351
<i>I went into the proletarian zones...</i>

08:39.485 --> 08:43.854
<i>I had sex with prostitutes,
I deliberately contracted syphilis.</i>

08:45.225 --> 08:48.524
<i>It was at this time
that I made contact with the Resistance.</i>

08:49.028 --> 08:53.192
<i>I was personally contacted
by the archtraitor, Goldstein...</i>

08:53.299 --> 08:56.462
<i>and ordered to assassinate
certain Inner Party officials.</i>

08:56.569 --> 08:57.593
Bugger!

08:57.704 --> 08:59.035
<i>This I did.</i>

09:00.340 --> 09:04.572
<i>My agents forged documents
and gained entry into the Ministry....</i>

09:04.677 --> 09:06.577
<i>"Thoughtcrime is death."</i>

09:08.014 --> 09:10.482
<i>"Thoughtcrime does not entail death."</i>

09:11.684 --> 09:13.618
<i>"Thoughtcrime is death."</i>

09:15.722 --> 09:19.419
<i>"I have committed,
even before setting pen to paper..."</i>

09:19.993 --> 09:23.087
<i>"the essential crime
that contains all others in itself."</i>

09:23.196 --> 09:27.064
<i>I have spent many hours
of my free time, encouraging my agents...</i>

09:27.166 --> 09:30.567
<i>to deface Party posters
and hoarding announcements.</i>

09:31.437 --> 09:34.338
<i>I read and memorized Goldstein's book.</i>

09:34.941 --> 09:38.934
<i>For 30 years,
I have plotted to bring down the Party.</i>

09:39.479 --> 09:41.504
<i>I was sick in mind and body.</i>

09:42.282 --> 09:46.082
<i>Together with my colleagues,
Aaronson and Rutherford...</i>

09:46.519 --> 09:49.647
<i>I did counterfeit
important Party documents...</i>

09:51.090 --> 09:54.582
<i>including ex-London permits
and travel passes.</i>

09:55.094 --> 09:57.722
<i>And that by use of these documents...</i>

09:58.064 --> 10:01.261
<i>my agents traveled freely
throughout Airstrip One...</i>

10:01.367 --> 10:04.825
<i>encouraging insurrection
and organizing a massive counterplot...</i>

10:04.937 --> 10:08.634
<i>to destroy the innermost faction
of the Oceanian leadership.</i>

10:10.677 --> 10:12.110
<i>Furthermore...</i>

10:13.179 --> 10:17.115
<i>I used my position of privilege
within the Inner Party...</i>

10:17.984 --> 10:20.919
<i>to pervert and betray the truth at all times...</i>

10:21.020 --> 10:25.923
<i>and to suggest, wherever possible,
that our traditional allies in Eastasia...</i>

10:26.759 --> 10:28.784
<i>were in fact, our deadly enemies.</i>

10:29.095 --> 10:32.064
<i>"April the 4th, 1984."</i>

10:32.198 --> 10:34.860
<i>In my position as Chief Factory Planner...</i>

10:35.034 --> 10:36.092
<i>"I think..."</i>

10:36.202 --> 10:38.136
<i>I stole military plans...</i>

10:38.438 --> 10:42.602
<i>and, at vast financial profit,
sold them to the Eurasian leadership.</i>

10:42.742 --> 10:44.369
<i>"...to the past..."</i>

10:45.044 --> 10:46.875
<i>"or to the future..."</i>

10:47.780 --> 10:50.248
<i>"to an age when thought is free."</i>

10:51.517 --> 10:54.315
<i>"From the age of Big Brother..."</i>

10:54.420 --> 10:57.150
<i>"from the age of the Thought Police..."</i>

10:59.325 --> 11:00.952
<i>"from a dead man..."</i>

11:02.628 --> 11:03.925
<i>"greetings!"</i>

11:52.512 --> 11:56.004
<i>30-to-40 group, take your places, please.</i>

11:57.250 --> 12:00.481
<i>Right, let's see which one of us
can touch his toes.</i>

12:00.586 --> 12:03.987
<i>Right over from the hips,
brothers and sisters, please.</i>

12:04.223 --> 12:06.191
<i>One, two.</i>

12:16.169 --> 12:19.764
<i>Smith? 6079, Smith, W.?</i>

12:20.907 --> 12:21.874
<i>Yes, you.</i>

12:22.542 --> 12:23.839
<i>Bend lower.</i>

12:24.877 --> 12:27.243
<i>You're not trying. Watch me.</i>

12:35.788 --> 12:38.279
<i>There, brother. That's what I want.</i>

12:38.925 --> 12:42.452
<i>Anyone under 45 is perfectly
capable of touching his toes.</i>

12:42.829 --> 12:45.229
<i>I'm 39, and I've had four children.</i>

12:45.398 --> 12:48.595
<i>We don't all have the privilege
of fighting in the front line.</i>

12:48.701 --> 12:51.192
<i>Remember our boys on the Malabar Front.</i>

12:51.404 --> 12:54.100
<i>Just think what they have to put up with.</i>

12:55.842 --> 12:59.642
<i>Production of water-heaters
is up 1.5 percent.</i>

13:00.847 --> 13:03.338
<i>Switchgear, 4.5 percent.</i>

13:03.549 --> 13:06.040
<i>Electrical wiring, 10 percent.</i>

13:06.652 --> 13:08.552
<i>Cigarettes, 18 percent.</i>

13:08.754 --> 13:11.052
<i>Bricks, 3 percent.</i>

13:11.390 --> 13:12.914
Morning, Smith.

13:13.025 --> 13:14.219
Parsons.

13:16.262 --> 13:17.820
Heard the rumor?

13:18.064 --> 13:19.622
No. Good news, is it?

13:19.799 --> 13:21.699
I should say so, yes.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.798
Choco rations going up.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.228
Really?

13:25.638 --> 13:27.731
Twenty-five grams next week.

13:28.107 --> 13:29.506
Doubleplus good.

13:30.877 --> 13:33.243
<i>Speakwrites, 14 percent.</i>

13:33.346 --> 13:35.974
<i>Vibra-aging castings, 9 percent.</i>

13:36.282 --> 13:40.582
By the way, Smith, I seem to have run out
of razor blades for some reason.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.450
You wouldn't happen to have any spare,
would you?

13:43.556 --> 13:46.047
I'm sorry, brother. I'm on the last one.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.259
<i>Bandages, 9 percent.</i>

13:48.794 --> 13:51.786
<i>In 1983, Oceania's coal output...</i>

13:51.898 --> 13:54.298
<i>reached 630 million tons.</i>

13:55.234 --> 13:59.830
<i>In 1976, coal output was 605 million tons...</i>

14:00.273 --> 14:02.468
<i>an increase of 4.1 percent.</i>

14:03.309 --> 14:05.903
<i>5.3 million tractors were produced...</i>

14:06.212 --> 14:09.147
<i>an increase of 17.6 percent.</i>

14:10.016 --> 14:11.745
<i>6.1 million trucks...</i>

14:11.851 --> 14:14.615
I wanted to ask you if you've got
any razor blades?

14:14.720 --> 14:16.779
I've tried all over the place.

14:16.889 --> 14:19.687
I've been using the same one for six weeks.

14:19.892 --> 14:23.259
<i>...a staggering increase of 93.4 percent.</i>

14:24.797 --> 14:27.129
Did you see the prisoners
hanged yesterday?

14:27.233 --> 14:30.361
No, I was working.
But I shall see it on the screens.

14:40.980 --> 14:43.312
You'll pick up the gin on the way?

14:46.319 --> 14:47.786
I'll have two.

14:52.558 --> 14:57.086
<i>2.9 million Airstrip One
Mark 5 submachine guns...</i>

14:58.064 --> 15:02.296
<i>3.1 million Grenville gas-operated
light machine guns...</i>

15:02.435 --> 15:03.629
Give me a gin.

15:03.736 --> 15:08.696
<i>2.2 million .5 Victory
recoil-operated heavy machine guns...</i>

15:09.976 --> 15:12.069
<i>6 million rifle grenades...</i>

15:12.178 --> 15:15.614
<i>9 million Perry pineapple pin grenades...</i>

15:15.948 --> 15:18.508
<i>and 1.4 million lightweight...</i>

15:18.618 --> 15:21.678
<i>spigot-launching,
anti-tank rocket projectors.</i>

15:23.155 --> 15:24.816
<i>Food production is also up...</i>

15:24.924 --> 15:28.018
-How's the Newspeak Committee?
-Working overtime.

15:28.294 --> 15:31.320
<i>...butter, 2 percent, milk, 6 percent.</i>

15:31.430 --> 15:34.092
Plusbig waste is in adjectives.

15:35.401 --> 15:39.132
Plusbig problem is timing the language
to scientific advance.

15:43.643 --> 15:46.703
It's a beautiful thing,
the destruction of words.

15:49.048 --> 15:52.506
You won't have seen the Dictionary,
10th edition yet, Smith?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.510
It's that thick.

15:55.221 --> 15:57.883
The 1 1th edition will be that thick.

16:00.359 --> 16:03.851
So the Revolution will be complete
when the language is perfect.

16:03.963 --> 16:08.229
The secret's to move from translation,
to direct thought, to automatic response.

16:08.334 --> 16:12.532
No need for self-discipline.
Language coming from here, not from here.

16:12.738 --> 16:14.228
Excuse me for intruding.

16:14.340 --> 16:17.776
You're saying that we'll be rid of
the last vestiges of Goldsteinism...

16:17.877 --> 16:19.845
when the language has been cleaned.

16:19.945 --> 16:23.346
-I couldn't agree with you more, brother.
-Absolutely.

16:27.286 --> 16:30.414
<i>Praise be to our leader
and the Party workers!</i>

16:34.860 --> 16:37.954
<i>Other munitions production figures
are as follows.</i>

16:38.631 --> 16:41.862
<i>70,000 M-20 tank destroyers...</i>

16:41.967 --> 16:43.992
<i>with 76-mm cannon.</i>

16:45.271 --> 16:46.431
Smith. Syme.

16:50.943 --> 16:53.275
It's encouraging to think that by 2050...

16:53.379 --> 16:57.281
not a single person will be able
to have a conversation like this.

16:57.550 --> 16:58.744
Except the proles?

16:58.851 --> 17:01.376
The proletariat don't count. They're animals.

17:02.221 --> 17:03.984
See the hanging?

17:04.557 --> 17:06.047
Missed it, myself.

17:06.157 --> 17:07.819
Bloody committees.

17:11.497 --> 17:16.093
<i>35,000 Black Eagle 500 cc motorbicycles.</i>

17:19.271 --> 17:21.102
Doubleplus good, this.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.776
You know, I don't think
there's a single piece of meat in this stew.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.781
Looks like meat. Tastes like meat.

17:30.649 --> 17:32.310
It isn't meat at all.

17:32.618 --> 17:34.142
Doubleplus good.

17:35.321 --> 17:36.913
Not like it, Smith?

17:37.022 --> 17:39.047
Yes, it's too rich for me.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.221
Do you mind if i...

17:41.794 --> 17:45.560
<i>Brothers and sisters,
the battle for production has been won.</i>

17:45.765 --> 17:48.632
<i>Completed returns
show that the standard of living...</i>

17:48.734 --> 17:51.897
<i>has risen by no less than 20 percent
over the last year.</i>

17:52.638 --> 17:57.041
<i>All over Oceania there've been spontaneous
demonstrations of Party workers...</i>

17:57.143 --> 17:59.509
<i>voicing their gratitude and joy!</i>

18:00.312 --> 18:04.749
<i>In honor of this massive overfulfillment
of the ninth three-year plan...</i>

18:04.850 --> 18:09.753

18:18.497 --> 18:20.192
<i>"If there is hope..."</i>

18:20.566 --> 18:22.466
<i>"it lies in the proles."</i>

18:23.435 --> 18:26.233
<i>"If they could become conscious
of their own strength..."</i>

18:26.338 --> 18:29.000
<i>"they would have no need to conspire."</i>

18:29.341 --> 18:31.605
<i>"History does not matter to them."</i>

18:42.388 --> 18:44.253
<i>"It was three years ago..."</i>

18:45.524 --> 18:47.287
<i>"on a dark evening."</i>

18:48.327 --> 18:50.295
<i>"Easy to slip the patrols."</i>

18:50.763 --> 18:53.493
<i>"And I'd gone into the proletarian areas."</i>

18:56.969 --> 19:00.336
<i>"There was no one else in the street,
and no telescreens."</i>

19:06.478 --> 19:08.378
<i>"She said, '$2.'"</i>

19:11.150 --> 19:12.845
<i>"So I went with her."</i>

19:16.422 --> 19:18.219
<i>"She had a young face..."</i>

19:19.525 --> 19:21.117
<i>"painted very thick."</i>

19:24.830 --> 19:27.230
<i>"It was really the paint that appealed to me..."</i>

19:27.333 --> 19:29.631
<i>"the whiteness of it, like a mask..."</i>

19:30.469 --> 19:32.437
<i>"and the bright red lips."</i>

19:35.608 --> 19:36.802
Come on.

19:52.224 --> 19:54.215
<i>"There were no preliminaries."</i>

19:55.494 --> 19:59.590
<i>"Standing there, with the scent
of dead insects and cheap perfume..."</i>

19:59.698 --> 20:02.531
<i>"I went ahead and did it, just the same."</i>

21:04.563 --> 21:06.360
Rutherford unperson.

21:06.632 --> 21:08.259
Substitute Ogilvy.

21:09.168 --> 21:11.500
Ogilvy bio, details as follows:

21:12.338 --> 21:13.635
"War hero."

21:14.073 --> 21:16.371
"Recently killed, Malabar Front."

21:16.976 --> 21:21.072
<i>"Today awarded posthumous
Order of Conspicuous Merit, Second Class."</i>

21:29.555 --> 21:31.750
<i>I accuse myself of sabotage...</i>

21:32.391 --> 21:34.757
<i>embezzlement of Party funds...</i>

21:35.260 --> 21:37.455
<i>sale of military secrets...</i>

21:37.563 --> 21:40.657
<i>of being in the pay
of the Government of Eurasia...</i>

21:40.766 --> 21:44.258
<i>of being a sexual pervert
and a thoughtcriminal.</i>

21:46.105 --> 21:49.734
<i>I exploited my trusted position
at the Ministry of Peace...</i>

21:49.908 --> 21:52.536
<i>to mislead our allies in Eastasia...</i>

21:53.112 --> 21:58.072
<i>and also to corrupt youth by means
of seditious literature and drugs.</i>

22:01.487 --> 22:03.682
<i>I am guilty on all counts.</i>

22:04.790 --> 22:06.052
<i>I stand here...</i>

22:06.158 --> 22:08.251
<i>a victim of the influence of....</i>

22:08.360 --> 22:10.920
<i>"Under the spreading chestnut tree..."</i>

22:11.530 --> 22:12.861
<i>"I sold you..."</i>

22:13.565 --> 22:15.055
<i>"you sold me."</i>

22:17.169 --> 22:18.727
<i>And I ask only...</i>

22:19.838 --> 22:21.066
<i>for you to accept...</i>

22:22.141 --> 22:23.938
<i>my love of our leader.</i>

23:59.138 --> 24:00.628
Can I help you?

24:05.811 --> 24:07.438
Anything special?

24:08.614 --> 24:09.876
I was here before.

24:11.383 --> 24:12.816
Razor blades.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.354
You sold me the notebook.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.480
Yes.

24:21.393 --> 24:22.655
Please look around.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.686
What's this?

24:52.090 --> 24:53.921
It's a beautiful thing.

24:54.893 --> 24:56.588
Over 100 years old.

25:00.365 --> 25:02.162
Cost you $4.

25:20.185 --> 25:23.677
There's another room upstairs
that you might like to see.

25:24.122 --> 25:26.147
But there's not much in it.

25:27.259 --> 25:28.886
Just a few things.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.119
My woman's dead.

26:04.930 --> 26:07.592
I'm just trying to sell the furniture.

26:12.804 --> 26:14.567
It's a beautiful bed...

26:15.040 --> 26:17.406
if you can get the bugs out of it.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.217
Interested in old prints at all?

26:36.862 --> 26:40.298
The frame's fixed to the wall,
but I daresay I could unscrew it.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.526
How did this escape?

26:43.435 --> 26:45.062
I know what it is.

26:45.737 --> 26:49.468
It's the museum in the street
outside the Palace of Justice.

26:49.908 --> 26:54.368
"Oranges and lemons,
say the bells of St. Clement's"

26:54.780 --> 26:56.247
What was that?

26:58.417 --> 26:59.884
Something old.

27:27.879 --> 27:29.278
<i>War is peace!</i>

27:30.449 --> 27:32.144
<i>Freedom is slavery!</i>

27:32.984 --> 27:34.815
<i>Ignorance is strength!</i>

27:38.790 --> 27:41.759
<i>A triumph of willpower over the orgasm.</i>

27:42.861 --> 27:46.262
<i>At a rally of the Anti-Sex League
in Victory Square tonight...</i>

27:46.365 --> 27:50.233
<i>held to celebrate a 50-percent decrease
in civil marriages...</i>

27:50.402 --> 27:53.769
<i>over 10,000 Party women
took a vow of celibacy...</i>

27:53.872 --> 27:57.171
<i>and pledged themselves as vessels
for the artificial insemination....</i>

27:57.275 --> 27:58.742
<i>"I hate her."</i>

27:59.378 --> 28:02.211
<i>"I should kill her before she denounces me."</i>

28:03.648 --> 28:07.243
<i>"I have disliked her
from the first moment of seeing her."</i>

29:12.150 --> 29:13.549
<i>Sector 43...</i>

29:14.286 --> 29:16.516
<i>929 male...</i>

29:16.988 --> 29:19.252
<i>753 female.</i>

29:20.125 --> 29:21.922
<i>Sector 44...</i>

29:22.027 --> 29:23.790
<i>437 male...</i>

29:24.763 --> 29:26.321
<i>609 female.</i>

29:27.999 --> 29:29.296
<i>Sector 45...</i>

29:30.001 --> 29:32.401
<i>222 male...</i>

29:32.571 --> 29:34.163
<i>220 female.</i>

29:35.106 --> 29:36.403
<i>Sector 46....</i>

29:36.575 --> 29:38.702
<i>-Are you hurt?
-It's nothing.</i>

29:40.879 --> 29:42.244
It's my arm.

29:43.548 --> 29:45.709
I'll be all right in a second.

29:46.084 --> 29:47.745
<i>Brother, could you....</i>

29:56.595 --> 29:58.187
Are you all right?

29:58.463 --> 29:59.862
It's nothing.

30:00.932 --> 30:03.457
I only gave my wrist a bit of a bang.

30:05.570 --> 30:07.265
Thank you, brother.

31:07.232 --> 31:08.563
<i>Who is she?</i>

31:09.568 --> 31:12.628
<i>All I know is that she works
in the corner section...</i>

31:12.737 --> 31:16.195
<i>probably on the proletarian
novel-writing machines.</i>

31:27.252 --> 31:29.345
Mrs. Parsons? A spanner?

31:30.488 --> 31:32.479
Under the sink, beside you.

31:52.811 --> 31:54.506
Thank you, brother.

31:54.946 --> 31:58.438
I wouldn't have had to bother you,
but my husband's out late.

31:58.950 --> 32:00.281
Committees.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.918
You know what us Parsons are like.

32:03.221 --> 32:05.314
You're a thoughtcriminal.

32:08.393 --> 32:11.123
They haven't been out much.

32:12.130 --> 32:13.392
Thank you, brother.

32:13.498 --> 32:15.898
<i>Attention! Your attention, please!</i>

32:16.267 --> 32:19.930
<i>A newsflash has this moment arrived
from the Malabar Front.</i>

32:20.071 --> 32:24.405
<i>The forces of Oceania in South India
have won a glorious victory.</i>

32:25.176 --> 32:28.304
<i>I am authorized to say
that the war against Eurasia...</i>

32:28.413 --> 32:31.246
<i>is within measurable distance of its end.</i>

32:31.349 --> 32:34.750
<i>40,000 Eurasian soldiers
have been killed or captured.</i>

33:31.509 --> 33:33.067
Can you hear me?

33:33.645 --> 33:34.669
Yes.

33:35.380 --> 33:37.678
Do you have an ex-London permit?

33:38.349 --> 33:39.407
Yes.

33:40.118 --> 33:42.484
Can you get Sunday afternoon off?

33:44.155 --> 33:45.213
Yes.

33:45.390 --> 33:46.687
Take this.

33:51.696 --> 33:54.859
It's quite precise. I rely on you to destroy it.

33:56.101 --> 33:58.092
Are you sure you can come?

33:58.603 --> 33:59.661
Yes.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.952
On your own, brother?

34:55.860 --> 34:58.658
No, I'm joining the Vic Mans
community hiking group.

34:59.497 --> 35:01.965
I was held up on urgent Minrec business.

35:12.610 --> 35:16.774
<i>Sing to the bravest on the sturdy fortress</i>

35:16.881 --> 35:21.375
<i>Sing to the soldiers on the battlefields</i>

35:21.686 --> 35:25.884
<i>Sing to the airmen in the burning azure</i>

35:26.124 --> 35:30.083
<i>Sing to the farmers' rising yields</i>

35:30.595 --> 35:34.929
<i>We are the children, builders of the future</i>

35:35.099 --> 35:39.468
<i>And we the children swear to thee</i>

35:39.671 --> 35:44.108
<i>Loyal devotion, fearless devotion</i>

35:44.209 --> 35:48.475
<i>And to die with dignity</i>

35:48.680 --> 35:50.739
<i>Sing to the faithful....</i>

35:55.386 --> 35:57.149
<i>A daring and resourceful maneuver...</i>

35:57.255 --> 36:00.088
<i>under the personal direction
of B.B. himself...</i>

36:00.191 --> 36:04.093
<i>ensuring the total annihilation of
the Eurasian heavy-armored divisions....</i>

36:48.907 --> 36:49.896
Look.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.713
It's a dream.

37:01.686 --> 37:03.017
I want you.

37:05.189 --> 37:06.383
Not here.

37:07.258 --> 37:09.726
Come back to the woods, it's safer.

37:23.041 --> 37:25.009
Have you done this before?

37:25.276 --> 37:26.573
Of course.

37:27.445 --> 37:29.072
Hundreds of times.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.613
-With Party members?
-Yes.

37:33.484 --> 37:35.111
Inner Party members?

37:35.219 --> 37:38.245
Not with those bastards.
Though there's plenty who would.

37:38.356 --> 37:40.824
Look, I hate purity.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.526
I hate goodness.

37:44.062 --> 37:46.656
I don't want virtue to exist anywhere.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.028
I want everyone corrupt.

37:49.167 --> 37:51.158
I ought to suit you, then.

37:51.903 --> 37:53.837
I'm corrupt to the core.

37:54.339 --> 37:56.204
Do you like doing this?

37:57.809 --> 37:59.572
<i>I don't mean just me.</i>

38:00.411 --> 38:01.742
I adore it.

39:09.614 --> 39:10.842
Winston?

39:11.549 --> 39:14.882
We shall meet in the place
where there is no darkness.

39:29.700 --> 39:34.501
<i>Adult literacy amongst the proletariat
has risen by 56 percent.</i>

39:35.473 --> 39:39.375
<i>The proletarian infant mortality rate
has dropped by 12 percent.</i>

39:39.977 --> 39:44.846
<i>Incidences of leukemia, tuberculosis,
and meningitis have dropped considerably.</i>

39:45.883 --> 39:50.081
<i>Improved diet has been responsible
for a dramatic decrease in rickets.</i>

39:50.621 --> 39:52.885
<i>Eye diseases show a steep drop.</i>

39:53.324 --> 39:56.384
<i>So, too, do deaths
from pneumonia and smallpox.</i>

39:56.994 --> 39:59.758
<i>The improvement in
sewerage and drainage systems...</i>

39:59.897 --> 40:02.297
<i>has resulted in better health, overall.</i>

40:03.534 --> 40:07.197
<i>State rodent operatives
report a 50-percent reduction...</i>

40:07.338 --> 40:10.933
<i>in the number of vermin
in the central proletarian zones.</i>

40:12.009 --> 40:14.603
I just want to finish by saying a few words...

40:14.712 --> 40:18.910
about the impact
of this imminent neurological breakthrough.

40:20.284 --> 40:23.481
When the orgasm
has been finally eradicated...

40:23.821 --> 40:27.689
the last remaining obstacle
to the psychological acceptance...

40:27.792 --> 40:32.161
of the principles of Ingsoc,
as applied to artsem, will be overcome.

40:32.830 --> 40:36.493
In other words, the unorthodox tendencies
towards ownlife...

40:37.168 --> 40:40.501
which constantly threaten
the natural erosion of the family unit...

40:40.838 --> 40:44.604
will no longer have
the biological support of the organism.

40:45.610 --> 40:50.138
As we all know, the biological and
social stimulation of the family leads to...

40:50.414 --> 40:53.542
private reflection, outside Party needs...

40:53.985 --> 40:57.216
and to the establishment
of unorthodox loyalties...

40:57.321 --> 40:59.949
which can only lead to thoughtcrime.

41:00.791 --> 41:05.091
The introduction of artsem, combined
with the neutralization of the orgasm...

41:05.196 --> 41:08.188
will effectively render obsolete the family...

41:08.366 --> 41:11.699
until it becomes impossible
to conceptualize.

41:12.703 --> 41:13.931
Thank you.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.447
Excuse me, brother.

41:33.591 --> 41:35.650
You dropped your ink pencil.

41:36.060 --> 41:37.550
Thank you, sister.

41:41.532 --> 41:43.727
<i>A pincer movement has developed...</i>

41:43.834 --> 41:47.827
<i>involving the floating fortresses
of the Eurasian 17th Fleet...</i>

42:07.658 --> 42:08.886
Not much.

42:12.763 --> 42:15.095
Not much left at all, these days.

42:15.633 --> 42:16.793
Walls.

42:18.336 --> 42:19.963
Police don't like us much.

42:21.639 --> 42:23.004
That room...

42:23.908 --> 42:25.273
how much?

42:26.310 --> 42:28.039
$4 a week.

42:53.070 --> 42:54.731
Traitor!

43:03.748 --> 43:05.443
Traitor! Criminal!

43:27.972 --> 43:30.941
<i>Big, Big, Big....</i>

43:40.718 --> 43:43.778
<i>A vast military buildup

<i>in the number of
radio-controlled rocket bombs...</i>

<i>directed at the most
densely populated areas of Airstrip One....</i>

43:57.902 --> 43:59.369
<i>It is folly...</i>

43:59.870 --> 44:03.670
<i>as though deliberately,
we move one step nearer the grave.</i>

44:04.742 --> 44:07.643
<i>I can't understand why

44:08.512 --> 44:10.480
<i>she, who is so careful.</i>

44:23.327 --> 44:24.419
Hello.

44:28.799 --> 44:30.562
<i>Let me show you what I've brought.</i>

44:40.077 --> 44:41.135
Look.

44:44.615 --> 44:45.912
What is it?

44:46.951 --> 44:48.248
Real sugar.

44:49.553 --> 44:50.986
Not saccharin.

44:52.022 --> 44:55.253
<i>And I've got a loaf of bread,
proper white bread...</i>

44:56.527 --> 44:57.789
and jam.

45:00.030 --> 45:01.725
A real tin of milk.

45:04.568 --> 45:05.626
Look.

45:08.939 --> 45:10.099
Coffee.

45:12.777 --> 45:14.108
Real coffee.

45:14.779 --> 45:16.747
Inner Party. Half a kilo.

45:18.649 --> 45:21.049
How did you manage
to get a hold of all this?

45:21.152 --> 45:23.950
There's nothing those bastards don't have.

45:27.124 --> 45:28.716
Aren't you pleased?

45:28.826 --> 45:29.850
Yes.

45:30.828 --> 45:32.125
Of course.

45:39.537 --> 45:40.765
Real tea.

45:41.872 --> 45:44.102
There's been a lot of tea about lately.

45:44.208 --> 45:46.699
They've captured India or something.

45:49.280 --> 45:50.577
I want you.

45:51.982 --> 45:53.347
I want you, too.

45:55.152 --> 45:56.176
Wait.

45:57.588 --> 46:00.284
Turn around, and don't look until I tell you.

46:19.944 --> 46:21.434
Listen to that.

46:22.880 --> 46:26.748
How can she make a song
written by a machine sound so beautiful?

46:33.757 --> 46:35.691
You can turn around now.

46:51.408 --> 46:53.501
<i>-I....
-Winston....</i>

46:58.983 --> 47:00.473
Do you like me?

47:04.688 --> 47:06.178
More than ever.

47:22.439 --> 47:25.499
<i>Was there ever a time

<i>"all else follows."</i>

48:02.846 --> 48:04.711

<i>We'll rehab the war from a neutral zone,

<i>I've been reading
your Newspeak articles in The Times.</i>

50:15.245 --> 50:16.303
Yes.

50:16.680 --> 50:20.013
You write very elegantly.
That is not my own opinion.

50:20.551 --> 50:24.317
I was recently talking to a friend of yours,
who is an expert.

50:24.421 --> 50:27.288
His name has slipped my memory
for a moment.

50:27.725 --> 50:32.526
What I wanted to say was, that there were
one or two unwords, only very recent.

50:33.497 --> 50:37.058
Have you seen the 10th edition
of the Newspeak Dictionary?

50:37.468 --> 50:40.562
No, we're still using
the 9th edition at Minrec.

50:40.971 --> 50:44.873
A few advance copies
have been segregated. I have one myself.

50:47.377 --> 50:49.174
You might be interested.

50:49.279 --> 50:50.303
Yes.

50:50.948 --> 50:53.883
There are some plus skillful
new developments.

50:54.318 --> 50:56.377
Let me give you my address.

50:59.223 --> 51:01.714
I'm usually at home in the evenings.

51:01.825 --> 51:04.851
If not, my servant
will give you the dictionary.

51:16.940 --> 51:19.272

Half the water's boiled away.

52:42.359 --> 52:44.293
What does the clock say?

52:46.063 --> 52:47.792
It says 21 :00 hours.

52:51.268 --> 52:53.862
What time do they cut the light
in your flats?

52:53.971 --> 52:55.063
23:30.

52:56.006 --> 52:57.940
At the hostel it's 23:00.

53:03.580 --> 53:04.911
What is it?

53:05.349 --> 53:06.782
I don't know.

53:08.118 --> 53:11.576
A little chunk of history
that they've forgotten to alter.

53:12.322 --> 53:14.381
Message from 100 years ago.

53:25.235 --> 53:28.636
"Oranges and lemons,
say the bells of St. Clement's"

53:28.739 --> 53:32.402
"You owe me three farthings,
say the bells of St. Martin's."

53:32.509 --> 53:35.171
Who taught you that? What is it?

53:36.980 --> 53:39.448
I don't know. I just know it.

53:46.523 --> 53:48.889
You know, the only thing to do...

53:49.493 --> 53:52.223
is to walk out of here before it's too late...

53:52.329 --> 53:54.627
and never see one another again.

53:55.832 --> 53:56.890
Yes.

53:57.801 --> 53:59.530
<i>Our luck can't last.</i>

54:02.506 --> 54:03.973
You're young...

54:05.309 --> 54:07.675
you look normal, you're innocent.

54:07.778 --> 54:11.305
You keep clear of people like me,
and you might stay alive.

54:12.683 --> 54:14.548
What you do, I do.

54:16.887 --> 54:18.115
I've thought it out.

54:22.125 --> 54:24.116
I'm good at staying alive.

54:36.573 --> 54:38.541
When shall we meet again?

54:38.976 --> 54:41.536
Not for several weeks. It's not safe.

54:49.453 --> 54:51.182
Give me half an hour.

54:56.827 --> 54:57.919
I love you.

55:04.134 --> 55:05.192
Julia...

55:06.870 --> 55:09.338
Do you think the Resistance is real?

55:10.173 --> 55:11.197
No.

55:11.575 --> 55:13.133
None of it's real.

55:50.480 --> 55:53.643
Steamer! Dead overhead! Get down!

56:44.634 --> 56:48.730
...round the clock, plus a 153 sets
in eyes top a P.M.A. Willmer.

56:52.275 --> 56:54.573
<i>"Oceania is at war with Eastasia."</i>

56:54.911 --> 56:57.846
<i>"Oceania has always been
at war with Eastasia."</i>

56:58.315 --> 57:02.183
<i>"Eurasia is our ally.
Eurasia has always been our ally."</i>

57:03.987 --> 57:06.046
<i>"Everything fades into mist."</i>

57:06.756 --> 57:09.816
<i>"The past is erased, the erasure forgotten."</i>

57:10.794 --> 57:14.389
<i>"A lie becomes truth
and then becomes a lie again."</i>

57:52.402 --> 57:53.733
What is it?

57:58.808 --> 58:00.139
I dreamt...

58:03.013 --> 58:04.708
about my mother.

58:09.819 --> 58:11.252
What, darling?

58:29.539 --> 58:31.769
<i>It was during the wars...</i>

58:32.976 --> 58:34.603
<i>before the Party.</i>

58:48.425 --> 58:49.585
Winston!

59:01.304 --> 59:03.135
<i>I couldn't help myself.</i>

59:05.141 --> 59:07.109
<i>I knew what I had done...</i>

59:08.078 --> 59:10.103
<i>and I couldn't help myself.</i>

59:29.799 --> 59:32.962
<i>When I went back, hours later...</i>

59:35.572 --> 59:37.836
<i>my mother and sister were gone.</i>

59:40.877 --> 59:42.742
<i>I never saw them again.</i>

59:52.989 --> 59:55.480
So it's not just staying alive.

59:56.126 --> 59:58.424
It's staying human that's important.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:03.065
What counts...

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.560
is that we don't betray each other.

01:00:06.836 --> 01:00:09.862
If you mean confessing,
we're bound to do that.

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:11.872
Everybody does.

01:00:12.509 --> 01:00:13.942
You can't help it.

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:16.579
I don't mean confessing.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.971
Confessing isn't betrayal.

01:00:20.884 --> 01:00:22.442
I mean feelings.

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:27.385
If they can make me change my feelings...

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:31.491
they can stop me from loving you.

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:35.756
That will be real betrayal.

01:00:38.902 --> 01:00:40.563
They can't do that.

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:44.270
It's the one thing they can't do.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:46.506
They can torture you...

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:49.368
and make you say anything.

01:00:51.348 --> 01:00:53.816
But they can't make you believe it.

01:00:56.086 --> 01:00:58.077
They can't get inside you.

01:00:58.188 --> 01:01:00.315
They can't get to your heart.

01:01:04.728 --> 01:01:06.696
<i>I'm going to see O'Brien.</i>

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:09.658

<i>actively engaged in the latest conspiracy....</i>

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:49.762
Not much of this gets
to the Outer Party, I'm afraid.

01:02:51.701 --> 01:02:52.725
To our leader.

01:02:52.836 --> 01:02:56.772
<i>...that our eternal allies in Eurasia
are turning against us.</i>

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:02.207
<i>More nests of conspirators
and saboteurs have been uncovered...</i>

01:03:02.312 --> 01:03:05.076
<i>and further arrests are expected shortly.</i>

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:13.711
<i>You can....</i>

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:17.784
Yes. We are allowed that privilege.

01:03:19.496 --> 01:03:21.088
Some more of this?

01:03:21.698 --> 01:03:23.290
It's called wine.

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:41.414
There are thoughtcriminals
who maintain the Resistance is not real.

01:03:42.752 --> 01:03:44.583
Believe me, Winston...

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:46.812
it is very real.

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:51.758
Perhaps you are not familiar
with how it operates.

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:54.193
I'm attentive to the news.

01:03:55.265 --> 01:03:56.391
Indeed.

01:03:56.733 --> 01:04:00.066
Perhaps you imagine
a huge network of conspirators...

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:02.899
prepared to commit
any atrocity to demoralize...

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:05.440
and weaken the order of our society.

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:08.569
The reality is infinitely more subtle.

01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:12.578
If Goldstein himself...

01:04:13.216 --> 01:04:18.119
fell into the hands of the Thought Police,
he could not give them a list of his agents.

01:04:18.755 --> 01:04:20.780
Such a list does not exist.

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:25.722
They're not an organization
in the sense we know.

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:29.426
Nothing holds it together but an idea.

01:04:30.934 --> 01:04:34.165
There is no possibility of change
in their lifetime.

01:04:34.804 --> 01:04:36.965
In the face of the Thought Police...

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.231
they cannot act collectively.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.901
Individually, they cheat...

01:04:43.846 --> 01:04:46.576
forge, blackmail, corrupt children...

01:04:46.683 --> 01:04:48.981
spread disease and prostitution...

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:55.484

from generation to generation.

<i>in a thousand years....</i>

Thank you.

<i>This is no longer war.</i>

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:09.158

<i>We must smash them.</i>

01:06:56.245 --> 01:06:58.076

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:37.816
<i>we shall,
as a demonstration of our resolve...</i>

01:07:38.688 --> 01:07:41.657
<i>as a sure sign to those
who attempt to threaten...</i>

01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:43.726
<i>our Party and our State...</i>

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:46.788
<i>we shall execute publicly...</i>

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:50.161
<i>the same number of Eastasian prisoners...</i>

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:53.793
<i>by hanging, drawing and quartering.</i>

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.835
<i>Big, Big, Big....</i>

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:48.283
<i>"In accordance to the principles
of Doublethink..."</i>

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:51.051
<i>"it does not matter if the war is not real..."</i>

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:54.129
<i>"or when it is, that victory is not possible."</i>

01:08:54.462 --> 01:08:58.763
<i>"The war is not meant to be won.
It is meant to be continuous."</i>

01:08:59.702 --> 01:09:02.170
<i>"The essential act of modern warfare..."</i>

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:05.399
<i>"is the destruction of the produce
of human labor."</i>

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:11.139
<i>"A hierarchical society is only possible
on the basis of poverty and ignorance."</i>

01:09:13.049 --> 01:09:15.643
"In principle,
the war effort is always planned..."

01:09:15.751 --> 01:09:18.652
"to keep society on the brink of starvation."

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:23.755
<i>"The war is waged by the ruling group
against its own subjects."</i>

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:27.956
<i>"And its object is not victory
over Eurasia or Eastasia..."</i>

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:32.689
<i>"but to keep the very structure
of society intact."</i>

01:09:38.374 --> 01:09:39.500
Julia?

01:09:40.776 --> 01:09:42.243
Are you awake?

01:10:01.998 --> 01:10:04.592
There is truth, and there is untruth.

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:09.762
To be in a minority of one
doesn't make you mad.

01:10:14.744 --> 01:10:16.336
Julia, my love...

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:19.939
I understand how.

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:23.749
<i>I don't understand why.</i>

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:48.974
I'm hungry.

01:10:51.213 --> 01:10:53.306
Let's make some more coffee.

01:11:11.334 --> 01:11:12.494
The water's cold.

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:23.540
There's no oil in it.

01:11:25.181 --> 01:11:27.741
That's strange. I thought it was full.

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:36.357
<i>They say that time heals all things</i>

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:43.097
<i>They say you can always forget</i>

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:49.337
<i>But the smiles and the tears</i>

01:11:49.572 --> 01:11:53.235
<i>across the years</i>

01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:58.771
<i>they twist my heartstrings yet.</i>

01:11:58.881 --> 01:12:00.405
She's beautiful.

01:12:06.389 --> 01:12:09.324
She's a meter across the hips. Easily.

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:11.926
It's her style of beauty.

01:12:17.299 --> 01:12:18.994
The future is hers.

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:29.034
We are the dead.

01:12:31.247 --> 01:12:32.771
We are the dead.

01:12:33.816 --> 01:12:35.408
<i>You are the dead.</i>

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:40.014
<i>Remain exactly where you are.</i>

01:12:40.322 --> 01:12:42.756
<i>Make no move until you are ordered.</i>

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:49.554
Now they can see us.

01:12:49.665 --> 01:12:51.394
<i>Now we can see you.</i>

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.668
<i>Clasp your hands behind your heads.</i>

01:12:55.171 --> 01:12:58.663
<i>Stand out in the middle of the room.
Stand back-to-back.</i>

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.343
<i>Do not touch one another.</i>

01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:05.940
The house is surrounded.

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.948
<i>The house is surrounded.</i>

01:13:09.618 --> 01:13:11.813
I suppose we may as well say goodbye.

01:13:11.921 --> 01:13:15.152
<i>You may as well say goodbye.
While we're on the subject...</i>

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:18.021
<i>"Here comes a candle to light you to bed."</i>

01:13:18.461 --> 01:13:21.225
<i>"Here comes a chopper
to chop off your head."</i>

01:14:34.937 --> 01:14:36.370
Pick that up.

01:14:52.188 --> 01:14:53.621
Thought Police.

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:35.454
<i>6079 Smith. Open your eyes.</i>

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:03.087
Parsons.

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:07.628
Keep away from me, Smith.

01:16:09.698 --> 01:16:11.666
I'm an agent of Goldstein.

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:19.173
I didn't know it myself.

01:16:21.644 --> 01:16:24.511
Thoughtcrime is so insidious.

01:16:26.482 --> 01:16:28.450
It just creeps up on you.

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:38.293
My daughter found it out.

01:16:40.029 --> 01:16:41.656
Very proud of her.

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:47.630
Very grateful I've been discovered
before it's too late.

01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:56.267
They won't shoot me, will they, Smith?

01:16:57.379 --> 01:17:00.405
I know I could be very useful
in a labor camp.

01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:11.286
<i>Room 101.</i>

01:17:19.068 --> 01:17:20.035
No.

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:25.097
<i>Please, you don't have to take me there.</i>

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:27.609
Why?

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:30.675
There's nothing I won't confess.

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:32.940
Nothing.

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:36.477
I've told you everything already.

01:17:38.087 --> 01:17:40.351
What is it you want me to know?

01:17:43.425 --> 01:17:45.290
Take him instead of me.

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:48.695
He's the thoughtcriminal. It's him you want.

01:18:40.749 --> 01:18:42.376
They got you, too.

01:18:43.152 --> 01:18:45.245
They got me a long time ago.

01:18:48.791 --> 01:18:51.282
You knew this would happen, Winston.

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:54.419
Don't deceive yourself.
You've always known it.

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:16.210
The photos of you and the girl
will be recycled for proletarian use.

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:58.259
Do you know where you are, Winston?

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:02.028
I don't know.

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:04.663
I can guess.

01:20:06.101 --> 01:20:08.035
In the Ministry of Love.

01:20:09.037 --> 01:20:11.631
Do you know how long you've been here?

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:13.231
No.

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:15.769
Weeks?

01:20:16.979 --> 01:20:18.139
Months?

01:20:19.348 --> 01:20:21.714
Do you know why you're here?

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:27.984
Shall I tell you why we brought you here?

01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:30.155
To cure you.

01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:32.418
To make you sane.

01:20:44.206 --> 01:20:45.503
That was 40.

01:20:45.607 --> 01:20:49.065
You can see that the numbers
on this dial run up to 100.

01:20:50.312 --> 01:20:53.213
Will you please remember
that, during our conversation?

01:20:53.315 --> 01:20:56.978
I have it in my power
to inflict pain on you at any time...

01:20:57.085 --> 01:20:59.451
and in whatever degree I choose.

01:21:06.128 --> 01:21:09.894
You know perfectly well
what is the matter with you, Winston.

01:21:10.098 --> 01:21:14.194
You've known it for years, though
you've fought against the knowledge.

01:21:14.303 --> 01:21:16.294
You are mentally deranged.

01:21:17.005 --> 01:21:19.439
You suffer from a defective memory.

01:21:20.909 --> 01:21:24.276
You never tried to cure yourself of it,
because you did not choose to.

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:28.649
It was a small effort of will,
which you were not ready to make.

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:32.186
For example...

01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:36.052
which power is Oceania at war with?

01:21:37.926 --> 01:21:39.325
Eastasia.

01:21:41.496 --> 01:21:43.896
Oceania is at war with Eastasia.

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:46.295
Eastasia.

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:48.161
Good.

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:52.501
And Oceania has always been at war
with Eastasia, has it not?

01:21:55.177 --> 01:21:57.907
Tell me what you think you remember.

01:22:03.085 --> 01:22:04.712
I remember...

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:09.681
that until only a week
before I was arrested...

01:22:10.525 --> 01:22:13.153
we weren't at war with Eastasia at all.

01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:16.453
It was Eurasia.

01:22:19.001 --> 01:22:21.162
That lasted four years, I think.

01:22:21.269 --> 01:22:22.793
Another example.

01:22:23.438 --> 01:22:25.030
A serious delusion.

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:30.207
Photographs about which
you've had hallucinations...

01:22:31.146 --> 01:22:33.910
which you believed you held in your hand.

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:37.946
They never existed.

01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:48.893
Say what you were about to say, Winston.

01:22:48.997 --> 01:22:50.430
They exist...

01:22:52.067 --> 01:22:53.364
in memory.

01:22:55.404 --> 01:22:56.769
I remember.

01:22:58.373 --> 01:22:59.806
You remember.

01:23:01.209 --> 01:23:02.870
I do not remember.

01:23:04.179 --> 01:23:07.706
Only the disciplined mind
can see reality, Winston.

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:12.286
It needs an act of self-destruction...

01:23:12.587 --> 01:23:14.077
an effort of the will.

01:23:15.323 --> 01:23:17.655
Do you remember writing in your diary:

01:23:17.759 --> 01:23:21.752
<i>"Freedom is the freedom to say
two plus two equals four"?</i>

01:23:23.932 --> 01:23:24.956
Yes.

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:27.766
How many fingers am I holding up?

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:29.394
Four.

01:23:29.871 --> 01:23:34.399
And if the Party says there are not four,
but five, then how many?

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:36.735
Five.

01:23:43.985 --> 01:23:45.009
No.

01:23:46.521 --> 01:23:49.012
That's no use. You're lying.

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:52.887
How many fingers, please?

01:23:56.765 --> 01:23:58.995
Four. What else could I say?

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:04.969
Five, or anything you like.
Will you please stop it?

01:24:06.608 --> 01:24:08.098
Stop the pain.

01:24:12.514 --> 01:24:14.175
How can I help it?

01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:20.415
How can I help
what I see in front of my eyes?

01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:24.324
Two and two makes four.

01:24:25.527 --> 01:24:27.222
Sometimes, Winston.

01:24:27.996 --> 01:24:31.397
Sometimes they are five,
sometimes they are three.

01:24:32.567 --> 01:24:35.195
Sometimes they are all of them at once.

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:48.739
Neither the past, nor the present,
nor the future...

01:24:49.351 --> 01:24:51.319
exists in its own right.

01:24:52.187 --> 01:24:54.348
Reality is in the human mind...

01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:57.785
not in the individual mind...

01:24:58.527 --> 01:25:01.860
which makes mistakes and soon perishes...

01:25:03.565 --> 01:25:05.829
but in the mind of the Party...

01:25:06.501 --> 01:25:09.800
which is collective and immortal.

01:25:13.675 --> 01:25:15.540
-Again.
-No.

01:25:23.418 --> 01:25:25.409
How many fingers, Winston?

01:25:27.722 --> 01:25:28.814
Four.

01:25:30.258 --> 01:25:32.522
Four, I suppose there are four.

01:25:33.461 --> 01:25:35.258
I tried to see five.

01:25:37.032 --> 01:25:38.590
I wish I could.

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:39.962
Which do you wish?

01:25:40.068 --> 01:25:43.765
To persuade me that you can see five,
or really to see them?

01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:46.001
Really to see them.

01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:49.802
Again.

01:25:58.887 --> 01:26:00.479
How many, Winston?

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:13.767
I don't know.

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:19.900
Better.

01:26:38.093 --> 01:26:41.859
<i>No one escapes, Winston.
There are no martyrs here.</i>

01:26:43.265 --> 01:26:45.927
<i>All the confessions made here are true.</i>

01:26:47.435 --> 01:26:50.734
We do not destroy the heretic
because he resists us.

01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:54.766
As long as he resists us,
we never destroy him.

01:26:55.810 --> 01:26:58.870
We make him one of ourselves
before we kill him.

01:26:59.781 --> 01:27:02.875
We make his brain perfect
before we blow it out.

01:27:04.085 --> 01:27:05.416
And then...

01:27:06.521 --> 01:27:10.514
when there is nothing left
but sorrow and love of Big Brother...

01:27:11.426 --> 01:27:14.054
we shall lift you clean out of history.

01:27:14.696 --> 01:27:18.496
We shall turn you into gas
and pour you into the stratosphere.

01:27:19.434 --> 01:27:21.402
Nothing will remain of you.

01:27:22.037 --> 01:27:23.971
Not a name in a register.

01:27:24.673 --> 01:27:26.971
Not a memory in a living brain.

01:27:28.209 --> 01:27:31.975
You will be annihilated in the past,
as well as in the future.

01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:35.543
Three thousand.

01:27:43.992 --> 01:27:46.051
<i>This time it won't hurt you.</i>

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:51.060
Before we bring this session to an end...

01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:54.168
I want you to ask me your questions.

01:27:54.502 --> 01:27:56.697
I want you to clear your mind.

01:28:00.241 --> 01:28:01.333
Julia.

01:28:02.243 --> 01:28:04.177
She betrayed you, Winston...

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:06.577
immediately, unreservedly.

01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:12.183
All her rebellion, deceit,
folly, dirty-mindedness...

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:14.312
has been turned out of her.

01:28:17.926 --> 01:28:19.826
Does Big Brother exist?

01:28:20.795 --> 01:28:22.092
Of course.

01:28:24.699 --> 01:28:26.428
The same way as me?

01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:30.062
You do not exist.

01:28:33.942 --> 01:28:38.140
You've not asked me the question
that is uppermost in your mind.

01:28:39.214 --> 01:28:41.375
You know what is in Room 101.

01:28:43.118 --> 01:28:45.518
Everyone knows what's in Room 101.

01:28:50.258 --> 01:28:51.384
Now...

01:28:52.527 --> 01:28:54.358
fix your eyes on mine.

01:29:11.579 --> 01:29:14.309
<i>What country is Oceania at war with?</i>

01:29:17.986 --> 01:29:19.578
<i>I don't remember.</i>

01:29:20.388 --> 01:29:22.879
<i>Oceania is at war with Eastasia.</i>

01:29:23.591 --> 01:29:25.388
<i>Do you remember that now?</i>

01:29:25.493 --> 01:29:26.585
Yes.

01:29:28.463 --> 01:29:30.829
<i>How many fingers am I holding up?</i>

01:29:32.834 --> 01:29:33.858
Five.

01:29:34.836 --> 01:29:37.930
You see, at least, that it is possible.

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:45.245
You've understood the reality of the past...

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.341
and of the present.

01:29:48.983 --> 01:29:50.712
Now for the future.

01:29:52.887 --> 01:29:54.479
A question:

01:29:55.323 --> 01:29:58.224
"How does one man
assert power over another?"

01:30:00.595 --> 01:30:02.392
By making him suffer.

01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:05.723
Exactly. Obedience is not enough.

01:30:07.635 --> 01:30:11.731
Power is inflicting pain and humiliation.
Otherwise, you cannot be sure.

01:30:12.173 --> 01:30:15.108
Power is tearing human minds apart...

01:30:16.511 --> 01:30:20.607
and putting them together again
in new shapes of your own choosing.

01:30:21.182 --> 01:30:23.650
Power is not a means, it is an end.

01:30:24.619 --> 01:30:28.988
In our world, there will only be triumph
and self-abasement.

01:30:30.158 --> 01:30:32.524
Everything else, we shall destroy.

01:30:33.228 --> 01:30:35.662
The past is forbidden. Why?

01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:40.293
Because when we can cut man
from his own past...

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:45.205
then we can cut him from his family,
his children, other men.

01:30:47.909 --> 01:30:50.969
There is no loyalty,
except loyalty to the Party.

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:55.515
There is no love, except love of Big Brother.

01:30:56.084 --> 01:30:59.986
All competing pleasures, we will destroy.

01:31:02.423 --> 01:31:05.790
If you want a vision of the future, imagine...

01:31:05.927 --> 01:31:08.657
a boot stamping on a human face forever.

01:31:16.738 --> 01:31:19.764
You are thinking
that my face is old and tired...

01:31:21.209 --> 01:31:23.370
that while I talk of power...

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:26.571
I'm unable to prevent
the decay of my own body.

01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:30.984
But the individual is only a cell.

01:31:32.287 --> 01:31:36.053
And the weariness of the cell
is the vigor of the organism.

01:31:36.591 --> 01:31:38.991
-You'll fail.
-Why?

01:31:40.762 --> 01:31:42.320
It's impossible.

01:31:43.765 --> 01:31:47.394
Hatred, the fear of life.

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:50.569
Why is hate less vital than love?

01:31:51.573 --> 01:31:53.040
I don't know.

01:31:53.208 --> 01:31:55.142
But somehow you'll fail.

01:31:56.044 --> 01:31:58.012
Something will defeat you.

01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.380
Life will defeat you.

01:32:01.816 --> 01:32:04.649
We control life at all levels.

01:32:06.054 --> 01:32:07.954
We create human nature.

01:32:09.023 --> 01:32:11.184
Men are infinitely malleable.

01:32:12.727 --> 01:32:17.323
Or perhaps you've returned to your old idea
that the proletarians will arise.

01:32:17.932 --> 01:32:19.866
Put it out of your mind.

01:32:20.401 --> 01:32:22.426
They are helpless animals.

01:32:23.271 --> 01:32:25.398
Humanity is the body.

01:32:26.975 --> 01:32:30.775
I don't care. In the end, they'll beat you.

01:32:31.913 --> 01:32:34.973
Sooner or later, they'll tear you to pieces.

01:32:36.884 --> 01:32:38.476
On what evidence?

01:32:40.188 --> 01:32:41.849
Goldstein's book.

01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:47.183
I wrote it.
Or, at least, I collaborated in writing it.

01:32:48.096 --> 01:32:51.031
No book is individually produced,
as you know.

01:32:52.634 --> 01:32:54.602
I just believe it.

01:32:56.738 --> 01:32:58.467
I know you'll fail.

01:33:00.141 --> 01:33:02.132
Something in this world...

01:33:03.144 --> 01:33:06.045
<i>some spirit you will never overcome....</i>

01:33:06.914 --> 01:33:08.973
What is it, this principle?

01:33:10.285 --> 01:33:11.912
I don't know.

01:33:13.288 --> 01:33:14.915
The spirit of man.

01:33:16.224 --> 01:33:18.488
And do you consider yourself a man?

01:33:19.294 --> 01:33:20.318
Yes.

01:33:23.131 --> 01:33:25.759
If you are a man, you're the last man.

01:33:27.201 --> 01:33:28.964
Your kind is extinct.

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:31.601
We are the inheritors.

01:33:33.474 --> 01:33:36.068
Do you understand that you are alone?

01:33:37.879 --> 01:33:39.813
You are outside history.

01:33:41.182 --> 01:33:42.581
You unexist.

01:33:46.621 --> 01:33:47.781
Get up.

01:34:06.441 --> 01:34:07.738
Come here.

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:27.025
Look at you.

01:34:28.496 --> 01:34:30.259
You're rotting away.

01:34:43.077 --> 01:34:44.806
That is the last man.

01:34:46.247 --> 01:34:49.080
If you are human, that is humanity.

01:34:51.052 --> 01:34:53.020
It will not last forever.

01:34:54.422 --> 01:34:57.289
You can escape from it
whenever you choose.

01:34:58.226 --> 01:35:00.057
Everything depends on you.

01:35:00.161 --> 01:35:01.526
You did it.

01:35:02.764 --> 01:35:05.130
You reduced me to this.

01:35:05.633 --> 01:35:07.032
No, Winston.

01:35:08.236 --> 01:35:10.295
You reduced yourself to it.

01:35:11.672 --> 01:35:13.537
When will you shoot me?

01:35:16.210 --> 01:35:18.075
Might take a long time.

01:35:19.347 --> 01:35:21.281
But don't give up hope.

01:35:22.083 --> 01:35:24.483
Everyone is cured sooner or later.

01:35:26.821 --> 01:35:28.413
And in the end...

01:35:29.957 --> 01:35:31.652
we shall shoot you.

01:35:32.527 --> 01:35:34.757
The law of gravity is nonsense.

01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:37.425
No such law exists.

01:35:38.099 --> 01:35:39.896
If I think I float...

01:35:40.601 --> 01:35:42.569
and you think I float...

01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:44.628
then it happens.

01:35:44.906 --> 01:35:46.237
I love you.

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:49.999
You have the strength, Winston.
You have the whole Party.

01:35:50.545 --> 01:35:52.172
You are the Party.

01:35:52.513 --> 01:35:55.380
You're one of us, one of the chosen.

01:35:56.117 --> 01:35:57.482
I love you.

01:35:58.419 --> 01:36:00.011
I love you, too.

01:36:08.996 --> 01:36:10.258
Julia, my love.

01:36:21.943 --> 01:36:23.069
<i>Get up.</i>

01:36:29.784 --> 01:36:31.547
<i>Stand up straighter.</i>

01:36:32.987 --> 01:36:34.750
<i>Look me in the face.</i>

01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:42.962
Tell me, Winston, and remember, no lies.

01:36:45.099 --> 01:36:48.227
What are your true feelings
towards Big Brother?

01:36:49.504 --> 01:36:51.938
-I hate him.
-You must love him.

01:36:53.541 --> 01:36:55.634
It's not enough to obey him.

01:36:56.477 --> 01:36:58.104
You must love him.

01:37:00.281 --> 01:37:01.543
Room 101.

01:37:29.043 --> 01:37:32.206
You asked me once, Winston,
what was in Room 101.

01:37:33.314 --> 01:37:37.045
I told you that you knew, already.
Everyone knows.

01:37:40.388 --> 01:37:42.686
The thing that is in Room 101 ...

01:37:43.891 --> 01:37:46.189
is the worst thing in the world.

01:37:57.438 --> 01:37:59.998
It goes beyond fear of pain or death.

01:38:01.509 --> 01:38:05.309
It is unendurable,
and it varies from individual to individual.

01:38:06.814 --> 01:38:10.580
It may be burial alive or castration...

01:38:11.552 --> 01:38:13.486
or many other things.

01:38:18.225 --> 01:38:20.716
In your case, it is rats.

01:38:21.896 --> 01:38:22.920
No.

01:38:28.402 --> 01:38:30.836
Please. What do you want me to do?

01:38:31.205 --> 01:38:33.537
You will do what is required of you.

01:38:33.841 --> 01:38:36.309
What? What is it?

01:38:37.445 --> 01:38:40.312
<i>How can I do it if I don't know what it is?</i>

01:38:42.249 --> 01:38:45.377
In the proletarian areas,
they will attack a baby...

01:38:46.153 --> 01:38:49.088
and within five minutes, strip it to the bone.

01:38:49.857 --> 01:38:52.587
They also attack the sick and dying.

01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:58.691
They show astonishing intelligence
in knowing when a human being is helpless.

01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:08.802
Please.

01:39:13.748 --> 01:39:17.047
<i>The mask fits over your head,
leaving no exit.</i>

01:39:18.352 --> 01:39:19.979
<i>I press the first lever...</i>

01:39:20.087 --> 01:39:22.578
and the rats move into
the front compartment.

01:39:23.824 --> 01:39:27.453
I press the second,
and the door of the cage will slide up.

01:39:28.829 --> 01:39:32.196
These starving brutes
will shoot at you like bullets.

01:39:32.667 --> 01:39:35.659
Have you ever seen a rat
leap through the air?

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:42.967
They will leap onto your face
and bore straight into it.

01:39:43.811 --> 01:39:46.405
Sometimes they attack the eyes first.

01:39:48.783 --> 01:39:52.617
Sometimes they burrow through the cheeks
and devour the tongue.

01:39:57.658 --> 01:40:01.389
Tell me. What do you want?

01:40:07.301 --> 01:40:08.666
No, please.

01:40:16.811 --> 01:40:18.403
I love you.

01:40:20.448 --> 01:40:23.508
Do it to her! Do it to Julia!

01:40:23.984 --> 01:40:26.452
I don't care what you do to her,
but do it to her!

01:40:26.554 --> 01:40:29.580
Tear her my face off!
Do it to Julia, not to me!

01:40:31.225 --> 01:40:33.216
Do it to Julia!

01:40:37.131 --> 01:40:38.359
Not me!

01:40:42.837 --> 01:40:46.773
<i>A vast military buildup has been reported
in the Sahara Desert...</i>

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:49.308
<i>in Sectors 17 and 18 of the war zones.</i>

01:40:50.678 --> 01:40:53.169
<i>That is the end of the announcement.</i>

01:41:32.453 --> 01:41:33.647
Brother.

01:41:42.563 --> 01:41:43.996
On the house.

01:41:51.806 --> 01:41:53.569
Thank you for coming.

01:41:57.611 --> 01:42:01.672
<i>You are warned to stand by
for an important announcement at 15:30.</i>

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:04.617
<i>This is news of
the gravest national consequence...</i>

01:42:04.718 --> 01:42:06.652
<i>concerning the war with Eurasia.</i>

01:42:06.754 --> 01:42:07.914
<i>15:30.</i>

01:42:09.857 --> 01:42:12.519
Are you worried about the African front?

01:42:14.695 --> 01:42:19.223
<i>The news is disquieting in the extreme.
I've been worrying about it all day.</i>

01:42:20.067 --> 01:42:22.558
It's not just a question of losing Africa.

01:42:22.670 --> 01:42:27.369
For the first time, the territory of Oceania
itself is threatened by invasion.

01:42:27.608 --> 01:42:29.269
<i>It's inconceivable.</i>

01:42:37.251 --> 01:42:40.516
It must have been possible
to outflank them in some way.

01:42:47.962 --> 01:42:49.623
I have an instinct.

01:42:51.498 --> 01:42:53.125
There's bad news on the way.

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:00.997
I told them all about you.

01:43:04.378 --> 01:43:07.677
I'm only thankful they got me
before it was too late.

01:43:08.082 --> 01:43:10.380
Yes, I told them about you, too.

01:43:11.452 --> 01:43:12.942
Thoughtcrime...

01:43:15.422 --> 01:43:17.390
sexcrime, all your treachery.

01:43:26.367 --> 01:43:28.358
I have a meeting to go to.

01:43:32.373 --> 01:43:33.897
We must meet again.

01:43:36.710 --> 01:43:37.768
Yes.

01:43:40.848 --> 01:43:42.577
We must meet again.

01:44:00.267 --> 01:44:02.963
<i>I accuse myself of the following crimes:</i>

01:44:04.004 --> 01:44:06.802
<i>I have seduced Party members
of both sexes...</i>

01:44:07.374 --> 01:44:09.934
<i>I've been to the proletarian areas...</i>

01:44:10.377 --> 01:44:13.972
<i>I deliberately contracted syphilis
in order to spread the disease...</i>

01:44:14.081 --> 01:44:16.549
<i>to my wife and other Party members.</i>

01:44:17.184 --> 01:44:20.950
<i>Together with other agents,
I have counterfeited banknotes...</i>

01:44:21.789 --> 01:44:26.158
<i>wrecked industrial machinery,
polluted the water supply...</i>

01:44:27.061 --> 01:44:29.996
<i>guided Eurasian rocket bombs
to targets on Airstrip One...</i>

01:44:30.097 --> 01:44:32.429
<i>by means of coded radio signals.</i>

01:44:34.368 --> 01:44:38.168
<i>I stand here, a victim of the influence
of Emmanuel Goldstein.</i>

01:44:39.073 --> 01:44:40.938
<i>Guilty on all counts.</i>

01:44:42.743 --> 01:44:45.837
<i>I'm glad I was caught.
I was mentally deranged.</i>

01:44:47.247 --> 01:44:48.714
<i>Now I am cured.</i>

01:44:50.351 --> 01:44:54.788
<i>I ask only for you to accept
my love of our leader.</i>

01:44:56.223 --> 01:45:00.421
<i>I ask only to be shot
while my mind is still clean.</i>

01:45:12.973 --> 01:45:14.668
<i>A glorious victory!</i>

01:45:14.908 --> 01:45:17.433
<i>A vast, strategic maneuver to outflank...</i>

01:45:17.544 --> 01:45:21.310
<i>the Eurasian Forces on the African front
has been successful.</i>

01:45:22.383 --> 01:45:27.320
<i>Perfectly coordinated, it has resulted
in the utter rout of the Eurasian Army.</i>

01:45:28.222 --> 01:45:33.023
<i>There have been nearly a million prisoners.
It has been an utter rout.</i>

01:45:33.994 --> 01:45:35.188
Waiter?

01:45:37.631 --> 01:45:42.091
<i>This immense victory brings the war
within measurable distance of its end.</i>

01:45:44.138 --> 01:45:45.628
Wonderful news.

01:46:43.297 --> 01:46:44.594
<i>I love you.</i>
