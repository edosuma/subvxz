00:00.939 --> 00:03.414
So last you was all
watching this, it was, like...

00:05.000 --> 00:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:14.289 --> 00:16.203
He'll love the hell out of that.

00:16.203 --> 00:17.436
That's my baby boy.

00:17.436 --> 00:18.907
Cotton is a man.

00:18.910 --> 00:20.836
Kick her out of the
group, and get that bitch

00:20.836 --> 00:22.069
away from my son.

00:22.069 --> 00:23.336
What about Otis?

00:23.336 --> 00:25.769
It's being handled.

00:25.769 --> 00:27.002
My dad's in jail.

00:27.002 --> 00:28.703
Must be why you're so
tight with your mom.

00:28.703 --> 00:30.603
I ain't got no
time for your activating, boy.

00:30.603 --> 00:31.936
You see they killin' us out here.

00:31.939 --> 00:34.893
Danielle Jackson
was shot and killed by police.

00:34.893 --> 00:36.503
No, no, no.

00:36.503 --> 00:37.581
They took her.

00:51.936 --> 00:53.436
Seems like bad things

00:53.436 --> 00:55.836
always happenin' to good people.

00:55.836 --> 01:00.203
Romans 8:28 says: "And we know
that for those who love God,

01:00.203 --> 01:02.902
"all things work together for good,

01:02.902 --> 01:06.236
for those who are called
according to his purpose."

01:06.236 --> 01:09.336
Lord, I'm tryin' to figure it out,

01:09.336 --> 01:11.836
but I can't see the purpose in this.

01:11.836 --> 01:14.869
She was so bossy.

01:14.869 --> 01:16.736
Ooh.

01:16.736 --> 01:18.503
From the minute she was born,

01:18.503 --> 01:20.103
she started running things.

01:20.103 --> 01:22.936
She was a...

01:22.936 --> 01:28.336
she was a doer, she was a go-getter.

01:28.336 --> 01:32.769
And she worked her way through school.

01:34.769 --> 01:36.336
What a child.

01:36.336 --> 01:40.069
She'll stand the test.

01:40.069 --> 01:42.836
What happened to Danielle,

01:42.839 --> 01:45.119
it was wrong.

01:45.122 --> 01:47.122
It was wrong!

01:47.125 --> 01:50.436
And it's this world that we live in!

01:50.436 --> 01:53.603
And the way we live in it.

01:53.603 --> 01:54.627
It's the reason

01:54.630 --> 01:57.670
why she's not here.

02:00.836 --> 02:02.570
Sister Gladys,

02:02.570 --> 02:05.348
we are all gonna lift you up in prayer.

02:06.336 --> 02:09.502
There's so many moments

02:09.502 --> 02:11.869
where the energy and the sadness

02:11.869 --> 02:14.122
has overtaken this congregation.

02:14.125 --> 02:18.269
Once again, trying to find the words

02:18.269 --> 02:21.036
to encourage you.

02:21.036 --> 02:23.869
This is a sister,

02:23.869 --> 02:25.836
a daughter,

02:25.836 --> 02:27.570
a granddaughter,

02:27.570 --> 02:30.503
a niece, a friend, a cousin,

02:30.503 --> 02:32.670
that's gone too soon.

02:32.670 --> 02:35.301
I'd like to invite

02:35.304 --> 02:38.533
my sister in Christ, Sister Kelly Price.

05:02.103 --> 05:04.736
_

05:06.570 --> 05:08.603
Jahil, por favor.

05:08.603 --> 05:11.736
Just cut the crap,
will you? Just cut it!

05:11.736 --> 05:13.536
You speak perfect English.

05:13.536 --> 05:17.203
Okay.

05:17.203 --> 05:19.503
I'm sorry I lied to you.

05:19.503 --> 05:21.103
Why did you?

05:21.103 --> 05:22.298
I needed a place to stay.

05:22.301 --> 05:24.203
Oh, just stop, all right? Stop!

05:24.203 --> 05:26.536
- I'm...
- Stop lying!

05:26.536 --> 05:28.069
I'm not.

05:28.069 --> 05:30.570
I had no money, no job, nowhere to go.

05:30.570 --> 05:34.002
"Ayude me por favor.
No tengo dónde ir."

05:34.002 --> 05:37.069
Probably some rich kid,
got disowned by your family.

05:37.069 --> 05:38.869
No, I'm not.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.967
I just happen to have a good ear.

05:40.967 --> 05:43.967
I learned from American songs and TV.

05:43.967 --> 05:45.367
And you can sing.

05:45.367 --> 05:47.166
Yeah, I heard you in the shower.

05:47.166 --> 05:49.441
You knew I was there.
You wanted me to hear you.

05:49.444 --> 05:51.444
No, I actually didn't.

05:54.166 --> 05:56.633
But I'm glad you finally did hear me.

05:56.633 --> 05:59.367
You know what?

05:59.367 --> 06:01.166
You a hustler.

06:01.166 --> 06:02.934
I know one when I see one.

06:02.934 --> 06:05.467
Just like you.

06:09.967 --> 06:11.200
Just like me?

06:11.200 --> 06:13.467
Mm-hmm.

06:13.467 --> 06:14.867
So, what?

06:14.867 --> 06:16.633
You want me to believe
it was just by chance

06:16.633 --> 06:18.033
you came knocking at my door?

06:18.033 --> 06:20.867
I don't believe in chance.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.700
I've always dreamed of being a singer.

06:27.700 --> 06:29.000
Especially here in the States.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.600
Oh, is that right?

06:30.600 --> 06:31.967
Yeah.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.033
So are you gonna kiss me?

06:39.266 --> 06:41.000
Take off my shoes.

06:47.266 --> 06:49.467
You better keep your story
straight with them girls.

06:51.033 --> 06:52.667
Of course.

06:52.667 --> 06:54.194
Good.

06:55.834 --> 06:58.033
Take off my belt.

07:24.914 --> 07:28.047
Look, I honestly think we
need to take all this hurt

07:28.050 --> 07:30.450
that's amongst us and
do the right thing.

07:31.667 --> 07:33.700
And that's taking it to the streets.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.000
Going to the police

07:35.000 --> 07:36.633
and protestin'.

07:36.633 --> 07:39.200
Oh, so you want to
give the police a reason

07:39.200 --> 07:40.767
to do even more damage.

07:40.767 --> 07:42.836
Since when do we need
to give 'em a reason?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.500
You turn on the news right now,

07:45.500 --> 07:47.243
all you see is black
people being killed.

07:47.246 --> 07:48.618
Then they want to say

07:48.621 --> 07:51.033
"unfortunate mistake at
a routine traffic stop."

07:51.033 --> 07:53.100
I'm with Derek.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.166
You know how this story goes, Pastor.

07:55.166 --> 07:57.266
A cop gets a smack on
the wrist and it's over.

07:57.266 --> 07:59.633
If we stay quiet, they'll
think it's okay with us.

07:59.633 --> 08:01.834
And it's not okay.

08:01.834 --> 08:03.943
- Of course it's not.
- Right.

08:03.946 --> 08:05.698
We need to be going down
to the police station

08:05.700 --> 08:07.200
and demand an indictment.

08:08.633 --> 08:10.266
You know what Dr. King said:

08:10.266 --> 08:12.266
"A riot is the language of the unheard."

08:12.266 --> 08:14.891
We're not rioting. Period.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.600
And we ain't gonna just pray, either.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.125
This ain't what you want.

08:33.393 --> 08:34.993
Yo, yo!

08:34.993 --> 08:37.460
I know. Meeting at 7:30.

08:37.460 --> 08:40.493
How 'bout you sing at the rally?

08:40.493 --> 08:42.059
Sing?

08:42.059 --> 08:44.327
No, I'm not doing that.

08:44.327 --> 08:46.360
- Why not?
- Because...

08:46.360 --> 08:48.194
it's about Danielle, not us.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.960
Your group should sing.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.526
Protest songs are a tradition.

08:51.526 --> 08:53.993
Odetta sang at the March on Washington.

08:53.993 --> 08:55.893
We're not Odetta.

08:55.893 --> 08:58.526
Especially not Star. I don't trust her

08:58.526 --> 09:00.273
- to take it seriously, all right?
- You're wrong.

09:00.275 --> 09:02.960
Star is... out of her mind,

09:02.960 --> 09:04.393
but she's down.

09:04.393 --> 09:05.893
But I'm not talking about Star.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.194
I'm talking about you.

09:07.194 --> 09:10.660
Come on, baby, just sing. Keep it 100.

09:12.060 --> 09:15.227
You want to move the people?

09:15.227 --> 09:16.493
Come on.

09:18.893 --> 09:20.727
All right, what
are we trying to say here?

09:20.727 --> 09:22.660
That it's the same old
story, day after day,

09:22.660 --> 09:24.194
and it's only getting worse.

09:25.980 --> 09:27.780
That works.

09:28.641 --> 09:30.307
What's up?

09:32.294 --> 09:34.493
Derek wants us to sing for the protest.

09:34.493 --> 09:35.626
I like that.

09:35.626 --> 09:37.393
I told him I wasn't sure.

09:37.393 --> 09:38.693
I didn't want it to become

09:38.693 --> 09:40.892
just another social media op for us.

09:40.895 --> 09:42.440
You mean me.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.192
Why don't you just say it?

09:46.192 --> 09:48.359
You like the spotlight
more than the music.

09:49.135 --> 09:50.825
Look, we're taking a stand for Danielle

09:50.825 --> 09:53.426
and her family.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.092
But I can't imagine you know
what everyday people go through.

09:56.092 --> 09:58.159
Everyday people like who, you?

09:58.159 --> 10:01.992
No, I can't. Bitch, I'm everyday people.

10:01.992 --> 10:04.123
I wasn't born with a
silver spoon up my ass.

10:04.126 --> 10:05.525
It doesn't
matter where I'm from.

10:05.525 --> 10:07.025
College Park or Park Avenue,

10:07.025 --> 10:08.592
I'm black wherever I go.

10:08.592 --> 10:09.692
Okay.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.011
And so am I.

10:12.492 --> 10:14.859
Oh, wow.

10:16.992 --> 10:20.792
So, I'm just too white for both of you.

10:20.792 --> 10:23.925
That's what this is.

10:23.925 --> 10:25.959
Okay.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.658
And that's how you feel, too?

10:27.658 --> 10:29.492
Bein' half-black?

10:29.492 --> 10:31.342
People don't see me that way.

10:34.792 --> 10:37.959
Don't ever confuse my
determination for our fame

10:37.959 --> 10:39.959
with me being able to understand

10:39.959 --> 10:41.292
and feel everybody right now.

10:43.825 --> 10:47.123
God, how could you box me in with them?

10:49.078 --> 10:50.795
Both of you should
know better than that.

10:52.692 --> 10:56.426
You want to do this
thing by yourselves, cool.

10:56.426 --> 11:00.125
I'll go to Hunter's.
I can't believe this.

11:00.125 --> 11:01.792
Should we go after her?

11:01.786 --> 11:03.619
You can.

11:03.622 --> 11:06.755
I've got a song to write.

11:10.326 --> 11:12.025
Who is it?

11:26.192 --> 11:28.125
What a dump.

11:28.125 --> 11:30.959
It's nice to see you, too, sweetheart.

11:30.959 --> 11:32.658
Are we alone?

11:32.658 --> 11:34.890
Yeah, my niece is at work.

11:34.893 --> 11:37.320
Your niece?

11:37.323 --> 11:39.125
Right.

11:39.125 --> 11:43.393
So I assume you're, uh,
you're here about Star?

11:43.396 --> 11:45.259
That little cow actually asked

11:45.259 --> 11:47.859
to have a three-way with me and my son.

11:47.859 --> 11:49.252
Look, I mean, what do
you want me to do, huh?

11:49.254 --> 11:51.036
I gave you my word. I'm on it.

11:51.039 --> 11:52.834
But your real issue should
be with Hunter, okay.

11:52.836 --> 11:54.958
He's attracted to a
certain type of woman.

11:54.961 --> 11:56.989
He can't help himself.

11:56.992 --> 11:58.525
Neither can you.

11:58.525 --> 12:01.592
You want her just as much as he does.

12:01.592 --> 12:03.525
I see right through you.

12:03.525 --> 12:05.426
Look, what makes you think
cutting her from the group

12:05.426 --> 12:06.825
is gonna break them up, anyway?

12:06.825 --> 12:09.925
She's a pathological narcissist.

12:12.491 --> 12:14.491
When she loses her footing,

12:14.491 --> 12:16.521
she's gonna throw a raging tantrum,

12:16.524 --> 12:19.157
and then her true, ugly
colors will come through.

12:19.157 --> 12:21.091
You sure about that, hon?

12:22.924 --> 12:25.091
I know where all the bodies are buried.

12:26.405 --> 12:29.005
Don't make me dig 'em up.

12:31.911 --> 12:33.911
It reeks of sex in here.

12:43.124 --> 12:45.924
So are you gonna fire Star?

12:45.924 --> 12:48.057
Hell no. That bitch is crazy.

12:48.057 --> 12:49.663
Look, no one's good enough for her son.

12:49.666 --> 12:51.124
He bankrolls her life.

12:51.124 --> 12:53.224
So what are you gonna do?

12:53.224 --> 12:55.424
What business is that of yours?

12:55.424 --> 12:58.257
I saw you bury a man,

12:58.257 --> 13:01.291
and you still can't trust me?

13:02.837 --> 13:04.591
No, listen, I got to deal with this.

13:04.591 --> 13:06.890
All right? I've got to
take care of some stuff.

13:06.890 --> 13:08.331
_

13:08.334 --> 13:10.374
Yeah, I got to get her off my back,

13:10.377 --> 13:12.610
find a way to keep her away from Star.

13:13.724 --> 13:15.890
Maybe I can help with that.

13:30.091 --> 13:31.724
Man...

13:31.724 --> 13:34.890
She was good people,
C. Her next lifetime,

13:34.890 --> 13:36.657
she gonna come back as a white woman.

13:37.657 --> 13:40.491
Hopefully a rich one.

13:40.494 --> 13:42.884
Hey, Ma, I think this salon is cursed.

13:42.884 --> 13:45.401
I mean, how many more bodies
gonna drop around here?

13:45.404 --> 13:47.491
What you talking about, bodies dropping?

13:47.491 --> 13:49.239
What she talking about, C?

13:49.242 --> 13:50.534
Miss Jenkins died.

13:50.537 --> 13:52.624
You know, the choir
director that had the stroke?

13:52.624 --> 13:56.091
Oh, damn. Good.

13:56.091 --> 13:57.700
She wore me out, anyway, honey.

13:57.703 --> 13:59.363
Every time you see her,
all she want to talk about

13:59.365 --> 14:01.431
is them four grandsons
of hers that's in jail.

14:02.991 --> 14:03.991
Bruce...

14:15.724 --> 14:18.724
Simone, don't you even think
about leaving this house.

14:18.724 --> 14:20.324
It's a peaceful protest.

14:20.324 --> 14:22.458
They always start off peaceful.

14:22.458 --> 14:24.324
Just remember, the
Atlanta police department

14:24.324 --> 14:26.314
is not the highest authority,

14:26.317 --> 14:29.350
no matter what they think... God is.

14:29.353 --> 14:31.320
Now, you're grown, I can't stop you.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.720
But you're underage and
you live in my house.

14:33.720 --> 14:36.453
So if you walk out that door,
don't bother coming back.

14:40.693 --> 14:42.793
Disrespectful little ass.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.053
Come on, let's get something to eat.

14:49.053 --> 14:50.954
No.

14:50.954 --> 14:53.520
You're not my mother.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.954
I'm gonna go sleep in Cotton's room.

15:06.578 --> 15:08.643
Thank you, Father God,

15:08.643 --> 15:10.942
for everything that You are,

15:10.942 --> 15:14.076
and everything You continue to be.

15:14.076 --> 15:16.876
Amen.

15:19.588 --> 15:21.155
What you praying for?

15:22.076 --> 15:23.976
Danielle.

15:23.976 --> 15:27.710
And the eternal hell for her kids?

15:27.710 --> 15:29.309
The kids are gonna be just fine.

15:29.309 --> 15:32.103
How? They can't even find their father.

15:32.106 --> 15:34.338
They're gonna end up in
the foster care system.

15:34.338 --> 15:37.039
You had nothing better
else to do this morning

15:37.039 --> 15:39.084
than to come here and
mess with my peace?

15:43.305 --> 15:45.438
We're supposed to be
singing in the rally,

15:45.438 --> 15:47.997
but Miss Carlotta won't let me go.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.106
Well, she's probably
concerned about your safety.

15:50.106 --> 15:52.605
Derek says it's gonna
be a peaceful protest.

15:52.605 --> 15:54.305
Supposedly.

15:54.305 --> 15:57.117
You know, I do a lot of
work in this community,

15:57.120 --> 16:00.169
and you may come in with
the most peaceful intentions,

16:00.172 --> 16:01.338
and things get crazy.

16:01.338 --> 16:04.338
Police brutality, rioting...

16:04.338 --> 16:06.338
Derek wants us to sing
to lift people's spirits.

16:06.338 --> 16:07.972
That's God's work, too.

16:07.972 --> 16:10.139
Look, I... I'm not gonna

16:10.139 --> 16:11.939
get in between you and Carlotta.

16:11.939 --> 16:13.505
You know, that's not my place.

16:13.505 --> 16:15.033
Okay, see?

16:15.040 --> 16:17.240
That's why our country
is in the state it's in.

16:17.240 --> 16:20.373
Because nobody's willing
to stick up for nobody.

16:22.807 --> 16:24.907
You can go back to praying, Pastor.

16:24.907 --> 16:27.206
I hope it helps.

16:42.340 --> 16:43.740
Eva.

16:43.740 --> 16:46.173
What are you doing here?

16:46.173 --> 16:48.306
Uh, it's about Star.

16:48.306 --> 16:50.306
Is she okay?

16:50.306 --> 16:53.340
Yeah, she's just very triste.

16:53.340 --> 16:55.007
Uh, because of her friend.

16:55.007 --> 16:57.616
Oh, yeah, I know. It's tragic.

16:57.619 --> 17:00.306
Yeah, you should do
something to animarla.

17:00.306 --> 17:01.874
Ani what?

17:01.874 --> 17:05.140
Uh, give to her happiness.

17:05.140 --> 17:06.397
Okay, yeah.

17:06.401 --> 17:08.401
You got any ideas?

17:08.404 --> 17:10.503
Take her away a few days.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.140
Like a romantic getaway?

17:14.140 --> 17:16.473
¿Porque no?

17:43.040 --> 17:46.807
Ed... how they treating
you in here, bro?

17:46.807 --> 17:48.840
Same as they treated you.

17:48.840 --> 17:50.206
What's up?

17:51.840 --> 17:55.007
Arlene. She's out of control.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.707
Yeah, she is.

17:56.707 --> 17:59.012
She's showing her ass
'cause I'm in here.

17:59.015 --> 18:01.237
And you felt sorry for her

18:01.240 --> 18:03.040
when I used to knock
her upside the head.

18:05.373 --> 18:07.240
She still come visit you?

18:07.240 --> 18:11.407
Yeah, every Saturday, like clockwork.

18:11.407 --> 18:13.645
And she still don't know?

18:13.648 --> 18:15.373
You think I'm gonna tell that bitch

18:15.373 --> 18:17.673
that she's the reason I'm here?

18:17.673 --> 18:20.173
That she's the one
that put me behind bars?

18:20.173 --> 18:24.206
I tell her I love her,
I miss her, I need her,

18:24.206 --> 18:26.040
and I can't wait to hug her again.

18:28.290 --> 18:30.140
Listen, man, I don't
come visit you 'cause

18:30.140 --> 18:31.840
I know you don't like to chitchat,

18:31.840 --> 18:35.974
so, uh, I'll cut to the chase.

18:35.974 --> 18:38.673
I'm back in the game.

18:38.673 --> 18:40.340
Come on, man, music.

18:40.340 --> 18:41.840
You know that's my thing.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.293
And I'm onto something big.

18:43.296 --> 18:44.955
I got this girl group I just signed,

18:44.958 --> 18:46.168
and, yo, the lead girl,

18:46.171 --> 18:47.362
I'll tell you, you've never seen

18:47.364 --> 18:48.564
anything like it in your life.

18:48.567 --> 18:51.173
But here's the thing,
she's dating your boy.

18:51.173 --> 18:54.400
And nobody's good enough for her boy.

18:55.473 --> 18:58.040
Arlene, she's gotta be checked.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.306
I mean, you got
anything you can give me?

19:00.306 --> 19:02.907
Something on her?

19:19.905 --> 19:22.239
These bags under my eyes are crazy.

19:23.656 --> 19:25.526
I haven't slept in days.

19:28.673 --> 19:30.673
How's the song coming?

19:30.673 --> 19:32.640
I finished it.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.407
I think I want you to
sing the first verse.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.373
Why don't you or Simone sing it?

19:36.373 --> 19:40.673
Because I think it fits your voice.

19:43.573 --> 19:45.640
All right, cool.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.140
I'm going to Hunter's.

19:47.140 --> 19:49.874
He has some surprise for me.

19:49.874 --> 19:51.526
You know the rally's tonight?

19:51.529 --> 19:53.363
We need to rehearse.

19:53.366 --> 19:56.019
Okay. I'll be back at
the rehearsal space later.

19:56.974 --> 19:58.740
Are we cool?

19:58.740 --> 20:01.473
Just don't be late.

20:05.501 --> 20:08.701
♪ It's okay... ♪

20:11.140 --> 20:13.540
So, we good?

20:13.540 --> 20:15.874
- Actually, no.
- What?

20:15.874 --> 20:18.373
I know you wasn't
faking what we just did.

20:18.373 --> 20:19.740
No, I wasn't.

20:19.740 --> 20:23.140
I have needs, Carlotta.

20:23.140 --> 20:26.322
I'm a man, just like your son.

20:30.604 --> 20:34.837
Look...

20:34.837 --> 20:37.671
we're gonna figure this out.

20:41.004 --> 20:43.238
Simone wants to go to the rally.

20:43.238 --> 20:45.138
Well, you're just going

20:45.138 --> 20:47.837
from one uncomfortable
subject to the next.

20:47.837 --> 20:50.238
She's got a lot of potential.

20:50.238 --> 20:52.771
Few do these days.

20:52.771 --> 20:54.604
I mean, you can't hate on that.

20:54.604 --> 20:56.637
No, what she is is a little con artist,

20:56.637 --> 20:58.304
going to you behind my back.

20:58.304 --> 21:02.104
The best thing you can
do is show up for her.

21:02.104 --> 21:04.771
Support her. Try and make
her feel like you're equal.

21:04.771 --> 21:07.997
Equal? She ain't paying no bills.

21:11.470 --> 21:14.238
Simone is different.

21:14.238 --> 21:17.291
She like her mother was.

21:17.294 --> 21:21.241
Just go to the rally. Support her.

21:21.244 --> 21:24.238
Stand with her, and you'll be
able to keep your eyes on her.

21:24.238 --> 21:27.238
And how should I handle Cotton?

21:27.238 --> 21:29.404
I'm still praying on that one.

21:31.600 --> 21:35.285
Look, come downstairs.

21:35.288 --> 21:37.821
I'm gonna make you some lunch.

21:38.881 --> 21:41.348
Well, why can't I have it here?

21:44.160 --> 21:46.637
You are something.

21:46.637 --> 21:49.004
Where's your sister?
She said she'd be here.

21:49.004 --> 21:50.149
I keep texting her,

21:50.152 --> 21:51.696
but she's not answering.

21:51.699 --> 21:53.737
Hola.

21:53.737 --> 21:57.271
Um... ¿Star aquí?

21:57.271 --> 22:00.771
Oh, Star is definitely not aquí.

22:00.771 --> 22:02.971
She went off with her dumbass baller

22:02.971 --> 22:04.637
that she keeps on a very short leash.

22:04.637 --> 22:06.138
I think he has her on the leash.

22:06.138 --> 22:07.437
Leash?

22:07.437 --> 22:08.504
No entiendo.

22:08.504 --> 22:10.087
No te preocupes.

22:10.407 --> 22:12.887
_

22:25.271 --> 22:26.971
How did I fall asleep?

22:26.971 --> 22:28.470
You needed the rest.

22:28.470 --> 22:29.771
You didn't sleep last night.

22:29.771 --> 22:32.271
Where are we and where are we going?

22:32.271 --> 22:34.138
It's a surprise.

22:34.138 --> 22:36.138
I don't like surprises, Hunter.

22:36.138 --> 22:39.071
Oh, my God, I'm so late for rehearsal.

22:39.071 --> 22:40.749
I was supposed to be there hours ago.

22:40.752 --> 22:41.904
How long have we been driving?

22:41.904 --> 22:43.271
Just a couple hours, maybe.

22:43.274 --> 22:45.394
A couple of hours? Where are we going?

22:45.397 --> 22:46.897
Jekyll Island. It's off the coast.

22:46.900 --> 22:48.404
Figured we'd get away a few days.

22:48.404 --> 22:50.138
Hello?

22:50.138 --> 22:51.390
Where the hell are you?

22:51.392 --> 22:53.138
Tonight's important.
It's about Danielle.

22:53.138 --> 22:54.687
Yeah, no, I know I'm late.

22:54.690 --> 22:55.856
I'm on my way back, okay?

22:55.859 --> 22:56.925
On your way back?

22:56.928 --> 22:58.470
Yeah, I'm coming right now.

22:58.470 --> 23:00.971
You're not coming
anywhere. Give me that.

23:00.971 --> 23:02.520
- Hello?
- Hunter, give me my phone.

23:02.523 --> 23:04.397
Yeah, so, so, uh, she's
taking the day off.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.672
Give me my phone. Stop playing with me!

23:07.425 --> 23:08.858
Star? Hello?

23:09.937 --> 23:11.504
Oh, my God!

23:11.504 --> 23:13.470
Hello?

23:14.844 --> 23:16.883
- What is wrong with you?!
- Get back in the car.

23:16.886 --> 23:19.196
- That phone cost me money.
- I'll buy you a new one.

23:19.199 --> 23:20.299
That's not the point.

23:20.299 --> 23:22.698
I know your type

23:22.698 --> 23:24.332
and I am not the one.

23:24.332 --> 23:26.399
Hey, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.

23:26.399 --> 23:28.690
- No, no, it's not okay!
- Tell me what you want, I'll do it.

23:28.692 --> 23:31.010
- I'll do it.
- I want you to drive me back to the city.

23:32.494 --> 23:34.494
All right.

23:39.499 --> 23:41.798
Star, okay, fine.

23:41.798 --> 23:43.529
I'll drive you back.

23:53.765 --> 23:55.466
This is supposed to be
a three-part harmony.

23:55.466 --> 23:57.132
Can't you just rewrite it for two?

23:57.132 --> 23:58.832
No, there's no time.

23:58.832 --> 24:00.199
Someone needs to fill in.

24:00.199 --> 24:01.431
Can Cotton sing?

24:01.434 --> 24:03.332
You're joking, right?

24:03.332 --> 24:05.591
Okay, don't worry.
Star's gonna get here.

24:05.594 --> 24:07.332
I knew this was gonna happen.

24:07.332 --> 24:11.732
Uh, I can try... until she comes.

24:11.732 --> 24:13.232
Girl, you sing?

24:13.232 --> 24:14.499
Mm, poquito.

24:14.499 --> 24:18.232
Okay. Let's hear something.

24:39.698 --> 24:41.915

24:41.918 --> 24:43.451
Okay.

24:44.299 --> 24:46.332
But this is just until
Star gets here, right?

24:46.332 --> 24:48.876
- O-Of course.
- Yeah, I just don't want her

24:48.879 --> 24:50.512
to have any weird feelings about this.

24:50.515 --> 24:52.165
N... claro, no.

24:52.168 --> 24:53.164
Uh, me either.

24:53.167 --> 24:55.366
- All right. Let's do this.
- Cool.

24:55.366 --> 24:57.165

25:08.165 --> 25:09.965
If you're here
to drag my ass home,

25:09.965 --> 25:11.165
you can forget about it.

25:11.168 --> 25:12.486
I'm not here for that,

25:12.489 --> 25:13.665
you little con artist.

25:13.665 --> 25:15.865
I know you went to the
pastor behind my back.

25:15.865 --> 25:17.713
Yeah, well, it worked.
You're here, ain't you?

25:17.716 --> 25:19.798
You know, your mom and me

25:19.798 --> 25:21.798
sang at a club during the L.A. riots.

25:21.798 --> 25:24.366
We barely made it out alive.

25:24.366 --> 25:27.399
I got a bad feeling about this thing.

25:27.399 --> 25:31.199
Danielle would not want you
risking your lives like this.

25:31.199 --> 25:33.165
Say her name!

25:33.165 --> 25:34.732
Say her name!

25:34.732 --> 25:37.776
Say her name! Say her name!

25:37.779 --> 25:40.232
Say her name! Say her name!

25:40.232 --> 25:41.698
Hey.

25:41.698 --> 25:43.499
- Where's Star at?
- Where do you think?

25:43.499 --> 25:46.656
But it's okay, we have a backup.

25:46.659 --> 25:48.054
What do you mean, "backup"?

25:48.057 --> 25:51.518
Eva. Turns out she has mad pipes.

25:51.521 --> 25:52.834
Oh, is that right?

25:52.837 --> 25:54.065
Say her name!

25:54.065 --> 25:56.032
As protesters rally outside

25:56.032 --> 25:58.466
of Atlanta's Zone 5 Police Station,

25:58.466 --> 26:00.345
we've just received this report:

26:00.348 --> 26:03.132
the police chief will
now address the meeting...

26:03.132 --> 26:04.798
Indict him!

26:04.798 --> 26:07.466
Indict him! Indict him!

26:07.466 --> 26:10.732
Indict him! Indict him!

26:10.732 --> 26:13.083
- Everything all right?
- Just keeping an eye out.

26:13.086 --> 26:15.754
Can't let no outside agitators
mess up what we're about now.

26:17.065 --> 26:18.632
Y'all good? Y'all ready?

26:18.632 --> 26:20.399
Indict him!

26:20.399 --> 26:22.165
Indict him!

26:22.165 --> 26:23.981
We want justice for Danielle Jackson.

26:23.984 --> 26:25.532
- Yes! Yes!
- Right now!

26:25.532 --> 26:26.865
We want an indictment.

26:26.865 --> 26:28.232
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

26:28.232 --> 26:29.466
And we will stay here

26:29.466 --> 26:30.665
for as long as we have to.

26:30.665 --> 26:32.366
- Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

26:32.366 --> 26:34.798
Until the D.A. and
the Atlanta Police Department

26:34.798 --> 26:36.165
do the right thing.

26:39.032 --> 26:42.132
Indict him! Indict him!

26:42.132 --> 26:45.798
Indict him! Indict him! Indict...

26:53.586 --> 26:55.352
...calls that the officer

26:55.355 --> 26:57.032
involved in the shooting be indicted.

26:57.032 --> 26:59.499
Indict him! Indict him!

26:59.499 --> 27:01.065
Indict him!

27:01.065 --> 27:04.243
Thank you, thank you, thank you, guys.

27:04.246 --> 27:06.475
If y'all can just quiet down
for a little bit, please.

27:06.478 --> 27:08.612
I have a... a few ladies
who have something to say.

27:08.615 --> 27:10.499
They were really close
to Danielle Jackson

27:10.499 --> 27:12.565
and they got something to
say that y'all should hear.

27:12.565 --> 27:14.740
Let's honor her

27:14.743 --> 27:16.999
and make these police say her name.

29:27.847 --> 29:29.780
We want an indictment.

29:29.780 --> 29:30.903
- Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

29:30.906 --> 29:32.381
Fewer than one
in three black people

29:32.383 --> 29:34.411
killed by police this year
were suspected of a crime

29:34.413 --> 29:35.580
or allegedly armed.

29:37.213 --> 29:40.483
Let me guess. All of
this happened by chance.

29:41.380 --> 29:44.447
You wanted to get rid of Star.

29:44.447 --> 29:46.021
So did I.

29:47.977 --> 29:49.977
We work well together.

29:49.977 --> 29:53.377
You're starting to
scare me, and I like it.

29:53.377 --> 29:55.877
Let's get out of here.

30:00.644 --> 30:01.844
Come on, let's get going.

30:01.844 --> 30:03.644
The police chief is about to speak.

30:03.644 --> 30:05.677
I can already tell you
what he's gonna say.

30:05.677 --> 30:08.510
I'm not going anywhere.

30:08.510 --> 30:09.644
Neither am I.

30:17.610 --> 30:19.610
Where you think you going, Miss Thang?

30:19.610 --> 30:21.644
Get out of my way. I
got a man waiting for me.

30:21.644 --> 30:25.711
Oh. You better quote
Valley of the Dolls, bitch.

30:25.711 --> 30:28.610
This is breaking news.

30:28.610 --> 30:30.044
Turn that up.

30:30.044 --> 30:33.811
Good evening.
First and foremost,

30:33.811 --> 30:37.044
I'd like to extend my deepest
sympathies to the family

30:37.044 --> 30:38.844
and the loved ones of Danielle Jackson.

30:38.844 --> 30:40.977
Extension, denied.

30:40.977 --> 30:42.644
...gathering outside in her honor.

30:42.644 --> 30:45.377
I also know that they are
anxiously awaiting news,

30:45.377 --> 30:47.377
but I want to caution everyone.

30:47.377 --> 30:50.143
Regardless of what you
feel about the information

30:50.146 --> 30:51.380
you're about to hear,

30:51.383 --> 30:54.377
you are expected to conduct
yourselves in a civil manner

30:54.377 --> 30:57.211
and to observe the 10:00 p.m. curfew.

30:57.211 --> 30:59.964
After a thorough review

30:59.967 --> 31:02.777
of the traffic stop incident
involving Danielle Jackson,

31:02.777 --> 31:05.111
there are no charges at this time.

31:05.111 --> 31:09.644
Officer Dugan is
suspended on paid leave.

31:18.444 --> 31:19.877
He got off?

31:19.877 --> 31:21.510
Well, what did you expect?

31:27.677 --> 31:29.677
Now let's get the hell out of here.

31:29.677 --> 31:31.677
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

31:33.610 --> 31:35.644
How many more people have to die

31:35.644 --> 31:37.544
before the police are held responsible?

31:37.544 --> 31:39.278
No more!

31:39.278 --> 31:41.278
How many more people have to die

31:41.278 --> 31:43.958
- before the police are held responsible?
- No more!

31:43.961 --> 31:45.261
Say this with me:

31:45.264 --> 31:47.011
No justice, no peace.

31:47.011 --> 31:49.144
No crooked police.

31:49.144 --> 31:51.644
No justice, no peace.

31:51.644 --> 31:53.144
No crooked police.

31:53.144 --> 31:55.211
No justice, no peace.

31:55.211 --> 31:57.011
No crooked police.

31:57.011 --> 31:59.677
No justice, no peace.

31:59.677 --> 32:01.477
No crooked police.

32:01.477 --> 32:03.211
No justice, no peace.

32:03.211 --> 32:05.444
No crooked police.

32:05.444 --> 32:07.344
No justice, no peace.

32:23.377 --> 32:24.844
No crooked police!

32:34.644 --> 32:36.610
Yo, heads-up, Derek!

32:36.610 --> 32:37.844
We got infiltrators!

32:41.311 --> 32:43.610
Get behind me. Move!

32:43.610 --> 32:44.988
Not without Derek.

32:44.991 --> 32:46.844
Well, stay your stupid ass here then.

32:46.844 --> 32:48.610
No, no, Alex! Alex!

32:48.610 --> 32:49.977
Derek!

32:49.977 --> 32:51.944
No justice, no peace!

32:51.944 --> 32:53.544
This is not what we're about!

32:53.544 --> 32:56.111
Get off him!

32:56.111 --> 32:57.677
You okay, sir?

32:57.677 --> 32:59.269
About to call you an ambulance.

32:59.272 --> 33:01.644
This is not Black Lives Matter!

33:07.510 --> 33:09.311
I'm gonna call the ambulance
for you right now, okay? I...

33:09.311 --> 33:11.311
I'm just tryin' to help!

33:11.311 --> 33:12.477
Derek!

33:12.477 --> 33:13.811
Alexandra!

33:13.811 --> 33:15.444
I'm not leaving without him.

33:15.444 --> 33:16.956
You gonna end up in jail.

33:16.959 --> 33:19.644
No, not without Derek! Derek!

33:19.644 --> 33:21.844
- Derek!
- No justice, no peace!

33:23.677 --> 33:25.644
Yo!

33:25.644 --> 33:28.477
You got the wrong guy.
You got the wrong guy!

33:29.722 --> 33:31.782
No justice, no peace!

33:34.620 --> 33:36.095
Are they answering yet?

33:36.095 --> 33:38.292
It's still ringing.

33:38.295 --> 33:40.061
Don't worry, he's gonna be fine.

33:40.061 --> 33:42.261
He can't stay in there.

33:42.261 --> 33:44.928
I got to go. I got to tell
his grandma or something.

33:44.928 --> 33:47.061
Miss Carlotta already told her.

33:49.328 --> 33:50.861
- Zone 5 Station.
- Yes, hello?

33:50.861 --> 33:52.261
Hi, I'm looking for Derek Jones.

33:52.261 --> 33:54.128
He got arrested at the protest.

33:54.128 --> 33:56.328
Are y'all okay?

33:57.828 --> 33:59.395
Derek got arrested.

33:59.395 --> 34:00.728
What happened?

34:00.728 --> 34:02.961
Well, if you were there,
you would have known.

34:02.961 --> 34:07.628
We got stuck, and my phone was broken.

34:07.628 --> 34:09.056
I saw y'all at the protest,

34:09.060 --> 34:10.793
by the way, singing with Mamacita.

34:10.793 --> 34:12.562
She covered your ass.

34:12.562 --> 34:14.628
I didn't need my ass
covered, I needed to be...

34:14.628 --> 34:16.428
Shut up!

34:16.428 --> 34:18.320
I'm trying to get through
to Derek, all right?

34:18.322 --> 34:20.395
Good luck with that.

34:21.770 --> 34:23.960
He needs an attorney
or something, right?

34:23.960 --> 34:26.428
Nah, just bail.

34:26.428 --> 34:27.980
I got to get him out of there.

34:29.661 --> 34:32.793
Damn. We don't have the car anymore.

34:32.793 --> 34:34.628
Dammit, we should have kept the car.

34:34.628 --> 34:36.761
Otis is dead, why does he need a car?

34:36.761 --> 34:38.893
It was a smoking gun, though.

34:38.893 --> 34:41.828
Thank you. Don't put me on hold again.

34:41.828 --> 34:44.001
Yeah, I'm looking for
Derek Jones, my friend.

34:44.004 --> 34:46.761
Yeah, J-O-N-E-S.

34:46.761 --> 34:48.428

35:54.161 --> 35:56.604
Must feel good being right all the time.

36:03.595 --> 36:06.495
Let me tell you something.

36:06.495 --> 36:09.728
You right, I'm not your mother.

36:09.728 --> 36:11.019
I shouldn't have said that.

36:11.022 --> 36:12.592
No, let me finish.

36:12.595 --> 36:17.061
I was wrong to stop you
from going to that rally.

36:17.061 --> 36:19.728
What y'all were trying
to do was the right thing.

36:19.728 --> 36:22.828
Yeah, but we lost.

36:22.828 --> 36:24.794
No.

36:24.794 --> 36:26.761
That's not true.

36:28.761 --> 36:31.128
You win by speaking the truth,

36:31.128 --> 36:33.395
no matter what.

36:33.395 --> 36:37.061
Your music tonight...

36:37.061 --> 36:39.261
that was the truth.

36:43.495 --> 36:47.995
Sometimes I'm jaded, cynical,

36:47.995 --> 36:50.928
but I don't want you to become that way.

36:50.928 --> 36:53.495
I'm sorry.

37:05.728 --> 37:07.228
Didn't Cotton go out tonight?

37:07.228 --> 37:08.794
Yeah, her date picked her up.

37:11.961 --> 37:14.907
Oh, wait, that's Alex.

37:14.910 --> 37:16.077
You want a drink?

37:16.828 --> 37:18.794
- Whiskey.
- With what?

37:18.794 --> 37:21.828
Whiskey.

37:21.828 --> 37:24.495
So check this out. I
went down to that, uh,

37:24.495 --> 37:25.961
that training gym... you know, that one

37:25.961 --> 37:27.161
down at Atlantic Station?

37:27.161 --> 37:28.761
What?

37:28.761 --> 37:30.894
That's crazy, if you ask me.

37:30.894 --> 37:34.661
Coke and the gym... at your age?

37:34.661 --> 37:36.661
It's gonna equal a heart attack.

37:36.661 --> 37:38.761
There's that, um...

37:38.761 --> 37:40.295
that equipment manager down there.

37:40.295 --> 37:41.628
What's his name?

37:41.628 --> 37:44.661
- Roberto something?
- I don't know.

37:44.661 --> 37:47.782
Yeah, he and me had a pretty
interesting conversation.

37:49.095 --> 37:51.261
Started talking about Hunter.

37:51.261 --> 37:53.562
It was funny... something...

37:53.562 --> 37:55.495
something about P.E.Ds?

37:55.495 --> 37:58.462
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

37:58.462 --> 38:00.628
Yeah, you do.

38:00.628 --> 38:03.228
Performance-enhancing drugs?

38:03.228 --> 38:05.261
He said Hunter had been
taking them for years.

38:05.261 --> 38:07.168
All those vitamin B12 shots?

38:08.371 --> 38:10.459
The shame of it is
something like that gets out,

38:10.462 --> 38:11.628
it could end his career.

38:13.328 --> 38:15.295
You wouldn't do that to Hunter.

38:15.295 --> 38:16.928
Call my bluff.

38:20.595 --> 38:23.328
You got a lot of damn nerve.

38:23.328 --> 38:25.562
After I save your sorry-ass life,

38:25.562 --> 38:26.628
this is how you thank me?

38:26.628 --> 38:28.128
Get out of my house.

38:28.128 --> 38:30.495
Let me tell you something,
you go talk to Maggie,

38:30.495 --> 38:32.295
and I will tell anyone who listens

38:32.295 --> 38:34.696
what you did to make
your son a football star.

38:36.961 --> 38:38.562
What do you what?

38:38.562 --> 38:40.794
The whole deal is off. You're out.

38:40.794 --> 38:44.794
I'm taking those girls
to the top, my way.

38:56.928 --> 38:58.828
I got it.

39:25.459 --> 39:28.091
_

40:01.326 --> 40:04.026
What the hell is that?

40:52.495 --> 40:54.128
Where you coming from tonight?

40:54.128 --> 40:55.728
Home.

40:55.728 --> 40:59.022
License and registration?

40:59.025 --> 41:02.292
I don't have it on me.

41:02.295 --> 41:04.295
Step out of the vehicle.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.395
For what?

41:05.395 --> 41:07.228
Step out of the vehicle now.

41:07.228 --> 41:09.228
Don't make me ask you again.

41:09.228 --> 41:11.462
You got to be kidding me.

41:13.228 --> 41:14.828
You just pulled over the wrong girl.

41:14.828 --> 41:16.228
Put your hands against the vehicle.

41:16.228 --> 41:18.395
You can't profile me. I know my ri...

41:18.395 --> 41:20.995
- Lassiter, easy.
- Stand down, Swiley.

41:20.995 --> 41:23.154
- You're just gonna let him do this?
- Shut up.

41:24.228 --> 41:26.295
- You're under arrest.
- For what?

41:26.295 --> 41:29.462
Yo, I said for what?

41:29.462 --> 41:32.328
Can't even tell.

41:32.328 --> 41:34.095
Stop, you're hurting me.
