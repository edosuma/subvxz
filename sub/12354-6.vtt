<i>Marty:
Previously on House of lies...</i>

00:01.962 --> 00:03.730
U.S. national bank
has requested

00:03.765 --> 00:05.098
a sit-down with
a team headed

00:05.133 --> 00:07.299
specifically by you. Ah.

00:07.333 --> 00:10.268
I mean, I don't have to tell you how
valued you are here at galweather.

00:10.303 --> 00:12.604
You are one of our stars.

00:12.638 --> 00:14.138
My God. I have a 94% match

00:14.173 --> 00:15.608
with a shy Sarah.

00:15.642 --> 00:18.276
Doug. (Gasps) That's your match?

00:18.311 --> 00:20.411
When I'm through with the job,
I'm staring at a boatload of cash.

00:20.446 --> 00:21.946
And what happens when
you leave galweather?

00:21.980 --> 00:23.248
If you ever leave?

00:23.282 --> 00:24.616
What's that supposed to mean?

00:24.650 --> 00:25.783
And you met your husband.

00:25.818 --> 00:28.119
Yes, Kevin.
He's amazing.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.120
He's smart. (Sighs)

00:29.155 --> 00:30.956
I'm a... I'm a lucky girl.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.525
To think that your boss

00:32.558 --> 00:34.194
tried to talk me
out of hiring you.

00:34.228 --> 00:35.495
Um...

00:35.530 --> 00:36.763
My-my boss what?

Enlightened leadership.</i>

00:42.837 --> 00:45.938
Team enhancement.

00:45.972 --> 00:48.440
These are the hallmarks

00:48.475 --> 00:50.643
of the apex program.

00:50.677 --> 00:52.678
Now, during our stay here,

00:52.712 --> 00:54.012
we are going to be hearing

00:54.046 --> 00:56.213
from some of
the brightest minds,

00:56.248 --> 00:58.516
the most forward thinkers,

00:58.550 --> 01:00.451
leaders in the field

01:00.485 --> 01:04.187
of cutting-edge
corporate innovation.

01:04.221 --> 01:07.223
Simply put, this weekend
is a game-changer.

01:07.258 --> 01:08.958
The apex institute.

01:08.993 --> 01:11.027
Galweather stearn's
latest attempt

01:11.061 --> 01:12.462
at distancing itself

01:12.496 --> 01:13.697
from its sordid past.

01:13.731 --> 01:14.965
So we pay

01:14.999 --> 01:16.199
these assholes a fuck-ton

01:16.233 --> 01:17.800
of our hard-fleeced money

01:17.835 --> 01:20.236
so they can sell us
the same old antiquated bullshit

01:20.270 --> 01:22.505
about team building
and leadership skills,

01:22.539 --> 01:26.142
repackaged as the future
in corporate ingenuity.

01:26.176 --> 01:27.577
It's all part of
the "new ethics."

01:27.611 --> 01:29.245
Spearheaded by this woman.

01:29.279 --> 01:31.414
Julianne hofschraeger.

01:31.448 --> 01:33.850
That wolf in Gucci clothing

01:33.884 --> 01:35.084
that tried to Judas me

01:35.119 --> 01:36.719
on the U.S. national bank
consult.

01:36.754 --> 01:39.323
Now, I can either stir up
a shit storm

01:39.357 --> 01:41.825
of epic proportions
over this, or...

01:41.859 --> 01:44.327
I can just sit back

01:44.362 --> 01:45.862
and smile and nod,

01:45.896 --> 01:48.031
collect my riches,

01:48.066 --> 01:49.333
while she tries to convince us

01:49.367 --> 01:51.335
that we've entered into an era

01:51.369 --> 01:53.536
of new values based leadership.

It is a new era

01:59.243 --> 02:01.877
An era of responsible,

02:01.912 --> 02:05.114
values based leadership.

02:05.148 --> 02:09.518
A time for us not
simply to survive,

02:09.553 --> 02:12.188
but to thrive.

02:12.222 --> 02:13.923
As a family.

02:15.225 --> 02:16.426
Marty:
All right, guess we gotta

02:16.460 --> 02:18.094
do this bullshit. Hey.

02:18.129 --> 02:20.263
Come on. Let's go
get the boy wonder.

02:23.767 --> 02:25.735
I was wondering if you were
gonna show up.

02:25.769 --> 02:27.103
Well, you can stop wondering.

02:27.137 --> 02:28.504
You okay?

02:28.539 --> 02:29.939
Do you really want
to hear about it?

02:29.974 --> 02:31.174
I didn't think so.

02:34.044 --> 02:36.012
Am I bleeding? Are you all right?

02:36.046 --> 02:37.647
Feel like...
Punched you in the face.

02:37.681 --> 02:39.982
Went right in the face.
Doug: Yeah! Oh, God, yeah!

02:40.017 --> 02:42.618
(Doug moans,
bedsprings creaking)

02:42.653 --> 02:44.320
Oh... my God.

02:44.354 --> 02:46.020
Yeah, okay, there is it.

02:46.055 --> 02:47.552
(Gasps)
Doug: That's...

02:47.587 --> 02:49.020
(Laughs) What is that?

02:49.054 --> 02:50.454
He is definitely masturbating.

02:50.488 --> 02:52.556
(Woman moans) What,
with a split personality?

02:52.590 --> 02:53.824
Maybe...
Sounds like...

02:53.858 --> 02:55.725
(Doug groaning loudly) Doug? Oh, Doug.

02:55.760 --> 02:56.993
Doug! Doug! Doug! Doug!

02:57.028 --> 02:59.628
Doug? Doug! Okay, what?

02:59.663 --> 03:00.829
Jesus, Doug. Doug: Jesus Christ.

03:00.864 --> 03:02.297
How the fuck did you
get this room?

03:02.332 --> 03:05.035
I, um, house-sat for Pam
the events coordinator

03:05.069 --> 03:07.204
last weekend. Who cares, who
cares about the room, okay?

03:07.238 --> 03:08.472
What?
Is your girlfriend here?

03:08.506 --> 03:09.473
Doug does not
have a girlfriend.

03:09.507 --> 03:10.740
Yeah, I do.

03:10.775 --> 03:12.976
Sarah. I met her
in San Diego. Marty,

03:13.010 --> 03:14.377
I talk about her all the time.

03:14.411 --> 03:15.678
It just doesn't ring a bell.

03:15.713 --> 03:16.879
So she's here?

03:16.914 --> 03:17.980
Mm-hmm. Well, let's meet it.

03:18.014 --> 03:20.149
"It"? Her... she... is, um...

03:20.183 --> 03:22.084
No way.

03:22.118 --> 03:23.652
(Laughing): No way.

03:23.686 --> 03:24.719
She is... (Clears throat)

03:24.754 --> 03:26.187
She's indisposed at the moment.

03:26.222 --> 03:27.688
Another time.
We have no problem waiting.

03:27.723 --> 03:29.356
I don't know.
Well, he has a sitting area.

03:29.391 --> 03:31.725
An actual fucking sitting
area... Okay. No. Hey, Jeannie.

03:31.759 --> 03:33.026
Hey, hey! No!
(Talking over each other)

03:33.060 --> 03:34.560
Guys! No! I don't...

03:34.595 --> 03:35.828
Oh. Hey.

03:35.863 --> 03:38.030
Okay.
Shut the fuck up.

03:38.065 --> 03:39.264
(Giggles) Hi.

03:39.299 --> 03:40.365
This is the pod.
Yeah.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.667
This is great.

03:41.701 --> 03:43.334
Finally get to meet the pod. Yeah.

03:43.369 --> 03:44.569
Right.

03:44.603 --> 03:45.936
Not at all awkward.
(Sighs)

03:45.971 --> 03:47.771
To do that.
I'm sorry. Um...

03:47.805 --> 03:49.072
Yeah, you know
what? Um...

03:49.106 --> 03:50.873
This is Marty, and Clyde.

03:50.908 --> 03:53.008
I'm Clyde. It's very
nice to meet you. Oh!

03:53.043 --> 03:54.176
Oh! Oh, my goodness.

03:54.211 --> 03:55.511
That's a weird style
got a towel on.

03:55.545 --> 03:57.379
Of shaking hands.
And, um, Jeannie,

03:57.414 --> 03:58.914
of course.
Jeannie.

03:58.948 --> 04:00.682
Always outside our door
when we've had sex.

04:00.717 --> 04:02.017
(Laughs)

04:02.051 --> 04:03.252
Does feel like that,
doesn't it?

04:03.286 --> 04:04.520
How does that work?
It's...

04:04.554 --> 04:07.056
So... So. So...

04:07.090 --> 04:08.591
Why don't you get scrubbed up

04:08.625 --> 04:11.060
and let's go sit in the
stupid-ass lotus position?

04:11.094 --> 04:12.561
Yeah. I will. I'm coming.

04:12.596 --> 04:14.196
Right behind you.

04:14.231 --> 04:16.599
(Giggles) I heard it as I was saying it.

04:16.632 --> 04:18.100
I heard it as well.

04:18.135 --> 04:19.202
(Laughing)

04:19.236 --> 04:20.370
Um...
Uh...

04:20.404 --> 04:21.938
So... oh, yes. Yes. Very nice

04:21.973 --> 04:24.105
to meet all of you.
It was so nice

04:24.139 --> 04:25.438
to meet you, Sarah. Okay,
yeah, we covered that, Clyde.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.739
And, Doug?
Yeah?

04:26.773 --> 04:28.373
You sound like a
foghorn when you come.

04:28.407 --> 04:29.874
(Laughing) Go.

04:29.909 --> 04:31.876
(Clyde imitating foghorn):
Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

04:31.910 --> 04:33.577
Hee-haw... Get off of me. Fuck you.

04:33.612 --> 04:35.812
<i>Marty: Like if the
queen Mary got a donkey</i>

04:35.847 --> 04:37.214
stuffed into its foghorn.

04:37.248 --> 04:38.949
Well, she wants to fuck you.

04:38.983 --> 04:41.084
Hmm?
No...

04:41.119 --> 04:42.619
Hmm?
No.

04:42.654 --> 04:43.921
Oh, okay.

04:46.624 --> 04:49.092
Okay, hello, everyone.

04:49.127 --> 04:50.727
Or should I say...

04:50.762 --> 04:52.329
"Na-mayste."

04:52.363 --> 04:54.597
Nah, I wouldn't say
that. Doug: Hey, guys.

04:54.632 --> 04:56.799
Sorry I'm late.
Had to change the sheets,

04:56.834 --> 04:58.100
if you know what I mean.

04:58.135 --> 04:59.469
This is exciting, isn't it?

04:59.503 --> 05:01.771
Dr. day is a God

05:01.806 --> 05:03.640
in the field
of mindful meditation.

05:03.674 --> 05:05.108
The man doesn't get out of bed

05:05.143 --> 05:06.343
for less than six figures.

05:06.377 --> 05:07.978
Ooh, he sounds great.

05:08.012 --> 05:09.146
He sounds lazy.

05:09.180 --> 05:10.848
So... head on out.

05:10.882 --> 05:12.582
We're gonna meditate!
"Na-mayste."

05:12.617 --> 05:13.817
Yes. "Na-mayste."
"Na-mayste."

05:13.851 --> 05:15.285
Oh, hey,

05:15.320 --> 05:16.587
Marty, can I...?

05:16.621 --> 05:18.255
Just for a sec, just for a sec.

05:18.289 --> 05:19.490
So, um...

05:19.524 --> 05:20.758
I wanted to, uh, check in,

05:20.792 --> 05:22.460
see how everything
is going with brynn

05:22.494 --> 05:24.095
and U.S. national.

05:24.129 --> 05:25.629
Great. Yeah, I
think brynn is...

05:25.664 --> 05:27.031
Very satisfied.
Great.

05:27.065 --> 05:28.299
Were there some concerns?

05:28.333 --> 05:29.767
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

05:29.801 --> 05:31.202
Honestly, I was just,
I was just checking in.

05:31.236 --> 05:32.469
I'm sure you're gonna

05:32.504 --> 05:34.104
knock it out of the park for us.

05:34.139 --> 05:35.305
Well, thank you for that
vote of confidence.

05:35.340 --> 05:36.306
Yeah.
Okay.

05:36.341 --> 05:38.508
Oh, wait!
Wait, wait.

05:38.542 --> 05:39.976
Really exciting news.

05:40.011 --> 05:43.213
We dug deep in the coffers
and we were able to get

05:43.247 --> 05:45.149
Malcolm gladwell.

05:45.183 --> 05:47.150
No!
Seriously.

05:47.185 --> 05:49.019
Wow. He is going to
fly in this afternoon

05:49.054 --> 05:50.387
to speak to the partners

05:50.422 --> 05:53.491
about choice and happiness.
That is awesome.

05:53.525 --> 05:55.192
Fuckin' a, huh? (Laughs) Right.

05:55.227 --> 05:56.394
It's great. Yeah, it's unbelievable.

05:56.428 --> 05:58.129
I wish I could be here for it.

05:58.163 --> 06:00.131
Do you have someplace more
important that you have to be?

06:00.165 --> 06:02.367
Well, not...
Look, my kid...

06:02.401 --> 06:04.135
It's performing arts day
at his school,

06:04.169 --> 06:05.203
and I gotta...
In Los Angeles?

06:05.237 --> 06:06.304
Yeah.
Wh...

06:06.338 --> 06:07.538
I mean, th-that's a

06:07.573 --> 06:09.040
two hour drive each way.

06:09.074 --> 06:10.375
Uh, if I'm lucky.

06:10.409 --> 06:12.243
I mean, it is Los
Angeles, you know.

06:12.277 --> 06:13.678
Marty...

06:13.712 --> 06:15.346
You kn...

06:15.380 --> 06:17.014
This weekend, um...

06:17.048 --> 06:19.983
This seminar, this is
really important for

06:20.018 --> 06:21.485
the future of this company.

06:21.519 --> 06:23.020
Yeah.
Your future.

06:23.055 --> 06:24.255
Mm.

06:24.290 --> 06:26.024
Don't you think that you should

06:26.058 --> 06:28.026
be here for all of it?

06:28.060 --> 06:29.393
I mean... I would love to, and I wish

06:29.428 --> 06:30.895
there were two of me--
a lot of people do--

06:30.929 --> 06:32.330
but I made a promise
to my son, so...

06:32.364 --> 06:34.899
Oh... look. I cannot

06:34.933 --> 06:37.068
tell you the number
of dance recitals

06:37.102 --> 06:39.237
and soccer games
that I have missed

06:39.271 --> 06:40.505
over the years.

06:40.539 --> 06:42.006
And I-I still
think I am

06:42.040 --> 06:43.774
a pretty good parent.

06:43.809 --> 06:45.445
I'm sure you do.

06:45.479 --> 06:48.050
Are.

06:49.219 --> 06:52.054
You know what?

06:52.088 --> 06:54.356
I am confident

06:54.391 --> 06:56.792
that you are going to
make the right decision.

07:20.118 --> 07:21.318
Hey, Clyde.

07:21.352 --> 07:23.119
Sarah, right?
Yeah.

07:23.154 --> 07:24.888
I didn't even see you here,
that's crazy.

07:24.922 --> 07:26.456
I was just laying down for
a bit. (Laughs politely)

07:30.127 --> 07:31.761
Your body looks like you got burnt
a little bit. Does it? (Gasps)

07:31.796 --> 07:33.630
Oh, fuck... You're right. Yeah.

07:33.665 --> 07:35.265
Do you see, when you put
your hand on... Oh, I got it.

07:35.300 --> 07:36.634
Thank you. (Laughs)

07:36.668 --> 07:37.935
Sure.
Okay.

07:37.969 --> 07:39.436
Yeah.

07:41.139 --> 07:42.606
You know, someday
we're gonna chat

07:42.640 --> 07:43.941
when I have clothes on.

07:43.975 --> 07:46.244
Bite your tongue.
(Laughs)

07:46.278 --> 07:48.279
So you and Doug
met on a dating web site?

07:48.314 --> 07:50.515
We did, yeah.

07:50.550 --> 07:51.983
What would a girl like you,

07:52.018 --> 07:53.519
just hot

07:53.553 --> 07:54.920
as hell...
Okay.

07:54.955 --> 07:56.589
Need with a dating web site?

07:56.623 --> 07:58.992
(Giggles) Um...

07:59.026 --> 08:01.127
They're a great way to weed
out douchebags.

08:01.161 --> 08:02.962
Yeah?

08:02.996 --> 08:04.363
Yeah.

08:04.397 --> 08:05.864
I get it.
No, that makes total sense.

08:05.899 --> 08:07.767
(Laughs) Let me help you out.

08:07.801 --> 08:09.502
Uh, actually,
that's fine. I'm okay.

08:09.536 --> 08:10.836
Thanks, though. Stop it.
You have such tiny hands...

08:10.870 --> 08:12.471
Yeah.
...And you have so much skin.

08:12.505 --> 08:14.106
Oh, they're doing the job.
Really?

08:14.140 --> 08:15.307
Yeah. Thank you.
Do you know what you

08:15.341 --> 08:16.511
really need? And
it's gonna sound weird...

08:16.543 --> 08:17.476
Oh, I'm actually fine.

08:17.510 --> 08:18.811
Women always forget
the cleavage.

08:18.845 --> 08:20.312
The breasts always get
most of the attention.

08:20.346 --> 08:21.814
No, I don't think they do.
No one forgets their...

08:21.848 --> 08:22.949
Are you sure?
Yeah.

08:22.984 --> 08:24.853
Never forget.
Never... (Laughs) Right.

08:24.887 --> 08:27.224
Your tits are like 9/11.

08:27.258 --> 08:28.459
All right.
Yeah.

08:28.493 --> 08:30.193
Okay. So I'm gonna head out.

08:30.228 --> 08:32.395
But if you need anything,
you know my room number, okay?

08:33.698 --> 08:35.499
Um...

08:35.533 --> 08:36.799
All right, nice to see you.

08:36.833 --> 08:38.301
Nice to see you, too.

08:38.336 --> 08:39.669
Take care.

08:39.703 --> 08:41.671
You take care of your own self. I will.

08:41.706 --> 08:43.239
Don't forget, okay?

08:43.274 --> 08:44.541
Yep.
Okay.

08:45.943 --> 08:48.045
(Whispering):
Jesus Christ.

08:48.079 --> 08:50.847

Almost missed it.

08:50.882 --> 08:52.583
(Piano playing)

08:52.617 --> 08:54.753
Hey, pop.
Hey.

08:54.787 --> 08:57.389
I didn't miss anything, right? No.

08:57.424 --> 09:01.525
Oh, that was wonderful.
So beautiful. Thank you, girls.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.693
How about that?

09:03.728 --> 09:05.829
Hey.
Hey.

09:05.863 --> 09:09.032
Hey, baby.
Mmm. Sorry I'm late.

09:09.066 --> 09:10.667
I didn't miss him, did I?

09:10.701 --> 09:12.235
No, no. He's up next.

09:12.269 --> 09:13.536
Oh, sweet.

09:13.571 --> 09:15.271
Gita: Mrs. Anderson's
fourth-grade class.

09:15.306 --> 09:17.073
(Chuckles)

09:17.108 --> 09:18.542
What?

09:18.576 --> 09:20.777
Huh? We'll talk about this later.

09:20.811 --> 09:23.246
Oh, yeah, we'll definitely
gonna talk about it later.

09:23.280 --> 09:27.251
Okay, now our next group had
their hearts set on "krumping"

09:27.285 --> 09:30.087
for you all, but although
we're against

09:30.121 --> 09:34.257
any form of artistic censorship,
we're also big fans of being

09:34.292 --> 09:37.060
respectfully appropriate.

09:37.095 --> 09:39.263
So please welcome Roscoe kaan,

09:49.106 --> 09:50.907

All right, who cares?
Um, a guy

10:56.836 --> 10:58.804
with a dick
with big granny titties.

10:58.838 --> 11:00.806
It's okay. Paper and at the lower

11:00.840 --> 11:03.608
left-hand side, what is it?
A signature. Is there a movie

11:03.643 --> 11:04.976
<i>called big titty signatures?</i>

11:05.011 --> 11:06.511
(Groans) What?

11:06.545 --> 11:08.480
Growling, hitting the board

11:08.514 --> 11:11.483
Okay, time's up. Again.

11:11.517 --> 11:13.051
No! Come on! Serious?
God, "Santa claus!"

11:13.085 --> 11:15.387
Where do you see Santa claus
in any of that shit?

11:15.421 --> 11:17.522
"Saint," obviously, halo.

11:17.556 --> 11:18.656
Then what is this?

11:18.691 --> 11:20.559
These are big titties.
Do you see 'em?

11:20.593 --> 11:21.793
That's hands together!

11:21.828 --> 11:23.728
Old grandma titties!
Don't disrespect the hands.

11:23.763 --> 11:24.996
And then there's
just like a document.

11:25.031 --> 11:26.865
It's a contract.
This is the clause part.

11:26.900 --> 11:29.635
You expect me, you expect me
to get the clause part?

11:29.669 --> 11:31.303
Saint clause.
Santa claus.

11:31.337 --> 11:33.071
You're a fucking idiot, okay?
You're honestly the worst

11:33.105 --> 11:35.173
person I've ever seen in
my whole fucking life.

11:35.207 --> 11:36.841
You're gonna eat it
out there today, oberholt!

11:36.876 --> 11:38.043
We are gonna win on that raft.

11:38.077 --> 11:39.544
Why don't you do some more coke,
Francis?

11:39.579 --> 11:41.646
Never done coke
a day in my life.

11:41.681 --> 11:43.048
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

11:43.082 --> 11:45.083
What's wrong with you?
Get out of here!

11:45.117 --> 11:48.986
Don't tell me what to do? Hey,
Doug. We're gonna win, dick.

11:49.021 --> 11:50.154
Hey, Francis.

11:50.188 --> 11:52.023
Don't say hello to Francis.
You know what?

11:52.057 --> 11:53.324
Hey, just take the tape, guys.

11:53.358 --> 11:54.825
Wait. For real?

11:54.860 --> 11:56.327
Yeah. That guy's an asshole.
He made fun of my hair earlier.

11:56.361 --> 11:57.862
Yeah.
What? You have beautiful hair.

11:57.896 --> 11:59.497
Thank you. Let's go. Stop it. Come on.

11:59.531 --> 12:01.699
Go, go, go.
Look at you.

12:01.734 --> 12:04.035
Look at them.
Look at them.

12:04.069 --> 12:05.370
Yeah, they look like winners.

12:05.404 --> 12:06.837
Why are they trying so hard?

12:06.872 --> 12:08.372
<i>Why aren't you trying so hard?!</i>

12:08.407 --> 12:11.007
Because who gives a fuck?
Because we can win this thing!

12:11.041 --> 12:14.243
Being a team!
That's what this is about.

12:14.278 --> 12:16.345
Oh, my God! This is you.

12:16.379 --> 12:18.047
You're driv... Don't be
an asshole. Give me that.

12:18.081 --> 12:20.215
The raft's almost done.

12:20.250 --> 12:22.852
We're almost finished, oberholt.
You getting nervous, asshole?

12:22.886 --> 12:24.786
What's your fucking problem,
Francis?

12:24.821 --> 12:26.588
My fucking problem is
you and your pod walk around

12:26.623 --> 12:28.524
like you're the shit.

12:28.558 --> 12:30.025
Not so much the shit when

12:30.060 --> 12:32.228
Marty kaan's not around to hold
your hand, are ya?! (Laughs)

12:32.262 --> 12:33.930
Finished! It's done! Yes!

12:33.964 --> 12:36.733
Shit! Come on.
Keep going.

12:36.767 --> 12:38.568
Keep going.
Fuck it, let's go.

12:38.603 --> 12:41.071
No, no, no, no. We're not done.
We have to secure the bamboo.

12:41.105 --> 12:43.073
The bamboo's fucking fine.
Grab that end right now.

12:43.107 --> 12:44.808
One, two, three, up.
You better row

12:44.843 --> 12:46.877
like a fucking champion
out there, Doug.

12:46.911 --> 12:48.439
What? Me? When was that decided?

12:48.474 --> 12:50.072
Did you or did you not
row crew at Harvard?

12:50.106 --> 12:51.306
Well, as second alternate.
I never made it out

12:51.340 --> 12:53.274
of the rowing tanks.
Now is your fucking chance.

12:53.308 --> 12:54.908
I don't know. I feel like
we have an unfair advantage.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.643
Doug, Doug, will you be
a team player

12:56.677 --> 12:57.944
for once in your fucking life?!

12:57.978 --> 12:59.545
What did you...? Me?
I'm always a team player!

12:59.580 --> 13:01.748
Doug, get in the fucking raft!
Get in the fucking raft!

13:01.783 --> 13:03.584
Okay, okay, yeah.
Go! Ready?

13:03.618 --> 13:04.885
Up. Pop it in there.

13:04.919 --> 13:07.154
Get the hell out of
there. Go, go, go, go, go!

13:07.188 --> 13:10.056
Fuck.
Let's go. Let's go.

13:10.090 --> 13:14.160
No way. Uh-uh, no fucking way.
That is not stable.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.228
Go, goddamn it! All right,
all right, all right!

13:16.262 --> 13:19.565
All right, here we go. Jeannie,
don't push me. Doug, right now.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.468
I got it. I got it. Give me
the oar. Give me the oar!

13:22.502 --> 13:26.004
Oh, God! Oh, my God,
oh, my God!

13:26.039 --> 13:27.539
(Crowd shouting)

13:27.574 --> 13:28.907
Nice shorts.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.609
Hey, man, fucking
second place, asshole.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.777
Yeah, Doug!

13:31.811 --> 13:34.212
Huh?!

13:34.247 --> 13:36.315
(Overlapping shouting)

13:36.349 --> 13:39.418
Stop smiling. Just go!

13:39.452 --> 13:41.019
Oh, my God!

13:42.355 --> 13:44.790
I got this, man, I got this!

13:44.824 --> 13:46.359
You got it, Doug.
Let's go, Dougie.

13:46.393 --> 13:47.627
Doug! Doug!

13:47.661 --> 13:50.096
(Gasps)

13:52.466 --> 13:54.433
Fuck you, oberholt!

13:54.468 --> 13:56.602
Doug?
Doug?

13:56.637 --> 14:01.507
Help me! I can't swim!
I can't swim!

14:01.541 --> 14:03.141
Do something!

14:03.176 --> 14:04.810
(Yells)

14:04.844 --> 14:06.478
You fucking losers!

14:06.512 --> 14:07.946
We win!

14:07.981 --> 14:10.449
Oh, my God.

14:10.484 --> 14:12.751
(Crowd cheering)

14:14.554 --> 14:16.321
You're a big fucking
idiot, Doug.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.656
It's that shallow?

14:19.893 --> 14:21.360
Ooh, God, is the heating on?

14:21.394 --> 14:24.497
Ugh! Take it,
just get it all off.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.667
Yeah, can you...?
I've got it, yeah.

14:26.701 --> 14:28.302
You know, it's my fault really

14:28.337 --> 14:29.704
if you think about it.

14:29.738 --> 14:30.972
I should have

14:31.007 --> 14:32.708
just been honest
with them, you know?

14:32.742 --> 14:34.843
Yeah, they they wouldn't have
bullied you into doing it.

14:34.878 --> 14:38.080
Bullied? What? I don't think
I was exactly bullied.

14:38.114 --> 14:42.018
Really? So, what,
you volunteered?

14:42.052 --> 14:44.588
Even though you don't
know how to swim?

14:44.622 --> 14:47.758
Well, no. Come on. It's a little
more complicated than that.

14:47.792 --> 14:49.660
Oh, sounds like it.

14:49.694 --> 14:51.562
You're gonna be late
for your party.

14:51.596 --> 14:52.830
<i>Our party.</i>

14:52.864 --> 14:54.732
Yeah, I don't think I should go.

14:54.767 --> 14:55.934
No, it's no problem, honestly.

14:55.968 --> 14:57.402
I'm just gonna say
you're a new hire.

14:57.437 --> 14:59.070
(Groans)
I don't want to go, Doug!

14:59.105 --> 15:00.606
What? Why not? Honestly? Yeah.

15:00.640 --> 15:04.343
Because the people you work with
are assholes. No, they're not.

15:04.377 --> 15:06.379
Yeah, and they don't respect
you, yeah.

15:06.413 --> 15:09.415
And I don't wanna be around
them. They... listen to me.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.417
They do respect me.
It's a consultant thing.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.286
They kinda have
their own way of doing it.

15:13.320 --> 15:16.556
Okay, well, I don't think they
were being very respectful

15:16.590 --> 15:19.025
when they knocked on our door
while we were having sex.

15:19.059 --> 15:22.394
Well, in fairness, they did wait
until we were finished, so...

15:25.999 --> 15:27.467
I'm sorry.

15:27.501 --> 15:29.435
And they weren't respectful
of you at your...

15:29.470 --> 15:31.037
Boat race thing.
I know.

15:31.072 --> 15:34.040
And Clyde certainly wasn't
respectful of me when he hit on me.

15:34.075 --> 15:36.810
Clyde hit on you?

15:36.844 --> 15:38.778
When I was laying out
by the pool.

15:38.813 --> 15:42.416
Were you wearing that, that sexy
little pink two-piece?

15:42.450 --> 15:44.218
What the fuck does that have
to do with anything?

15:44.252 --> 15:45.819
Hold on.
That's not what I mean.

15:45.854 --> 15:47.621
You just look so sexy

15:47.656 --> 15:49.623
in that thing.
You do. And, and,

15:49.658 --> 15:52.159
listen, I know Clyde, all right?
He talks a very big game,

15:52.194 --> 15:55.730
but I honestly don't think he
would "hit on you" hit on you.

15:55.764 --> 16:00.802
Mm-hmm, okay. He offered
to rub sunblock on my tits.

16:00.836 --> 16:03.104
Well, that's kind of like
a handshake for Clyde.

16:03.139 --> 16:05.907
Oh, Doug. I'm sorry. I
don't know why I do it.

16:05.942 --> 16:08.577
Honestly, you-you act like these
people are better than you,

16:08.611 --> 16:09.645
and they're not.

16:09.679 --> 16:10.913
You're smarter.

16:10.948 --> 16:12.481
Well, yeah.

16:12.516 --> 16:15.117
Yeah, you're more
handsome, okay? (Chuckles)

16:15.152 --> 16:17.920
You're better than them.

16:17.954 --> 16:20.155
And the fact
that you don't see it

16:20.190 --> 16:22.858
kinda makes you seem
like a putz.

16:27.964 --> 16:29.799
I'm gonna go get ready.

16:29.833 --> 16:31.634
Okay.

16:36.140 --> 16:39.175
Clyde: And what's gonna
happen when the raft breaks?

16:39.209 --> 16:40.710
You're gonna start drowning.

16:40.744 --> 16:42.278
Hey, have you guys...? Hey, hi. Hey.

16:42.312 --> 16:43.477
Have you guys seen Marty?

16:43.512 --> 16:44.710
Why?

16:44.744 --> 16:47.544
Um, 'cause I want to know.

16:47.579 --> 16:49.149
Well, he's not back yet.

16:49.183 --> 16:50.986
Well, fuck him then.
Let's have a party!

16:51.020 --> 16:52.220
Let's get some shots.

16:52.255 --> 16:54.656
(All clamoring)

16:54.690 --> 16:55.723
Let's do one more!

16:57.826 --> 17:00.461
Gotta hear it. Give me one
Marty b-school story.

17:00.495 --> 17:02.463
Oh, yeah. Come on.
More, more, more, more.

17:02.497 --> 17:03.498
He made me a mix tape once.

17:03.532 --> 17:04.866
Marty made you a mix tape?

17:04.900 --> 17:06.501
Shut the the fuck up.
Marty kaan?

17:06.535 --> 17:08.236
Did you guys remember
that song, "I swear"?

17:08.270 --> 17:10.037
Are you kidding me.
Yes, or course.

17:10.071 --> 17:11.505
You know what?
You know what? I bet

17:11.540 --> 17:13.007
he went to the all-4-one's
version

17:13.040 --> 17:14.509
over the far superior

17:14.542 --> 17:16.810
both:
John Michael Montgomery.

17:16.845 --> 17:19.146
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna make you a mix cd.

17:19.181 --> 17:19.981
Daddy!

17:20.015 --> 17:21.749
Oh, there he is.

17:21.782 --> 17:23.150
Marty!

17:23.185 --> 17:26.521
You guys seem
to be having a good time.

17:26.555 --> 17:27.922
Tamara was actually
just telling us

17:27.955 --> 17:29.691
what a sweetheart
you were in b-school.

17:29.725 --> 17:32.694
I am putting all your shit out
there tonight, honey.

17:32.729 --> 17:33.829
That's fantastic.

17:33.863 --> 17:35.230
Did you use to bring her coffee

17:35.265 --> 17:38.667
when she was up sleepy
all night studying? Mm-hmm.

17:38.701 --> 17:41.403
How you used to go
to poetry slams together.

17:41.437 --> 17:43.071
How you made her
an admittedly flawed,

17:43.105 --> 17:46.541
but nonetheless thoughtful
mix tape.

17:46.575 --> 17:50.078
(Singsongy): You loved
Tamara! You loved Tamara!

17:50.113 --> 17:52.347
(Laughs)

17:52.382 --> 17:54.283
I got a little bit drunk.

17:54.317 --> 17:55.718
Yeah, we could tell.

17:55.752 --> 17:57.053
Yeah, what started all this?

17:57.087 --> 17:58.621
I was just saying how much

17:58.655 --> 18:00.690
this party reminds me of the
ones we had at b-school.

18:00.724 --> 18:03.225
Really? Well, unless there's
a keg of natty ice somewhere

18:03.260 --> 18:05.294
and Monica's passed out
in the corner, I don't think

18:05.329 --> 18:06.896
this is anything
like b-school days.

18:06.930 --> 18:09.899
Oh, okay, well, maybe I just
wanted to reminisce.

18:09.933 --> 18:11.467
And now,

18:11.502 --> 18:13.036
I think I want to dance.

18:13.070 --> 18:14.871
Oh, boy. Marty, do you want to dance?

18:14.906 --> 18:15.872
(Giggles)

18:15.907 --> 18:16.940
Marty, come dance with me.

18:16.975 --> 18:18.442
Dance, Marty.

18:18.476 --> 18:22.780
No, no, no, not unless I get
caught up with you guys first.

18:22.814 --> 18:24.314
Okay, all right, well,
if you're gonna go to the bar,

18:24.349 --> 18:26.249
just get us another, um,

18:26.284 --> 18:28.385
a bottle 'cause we're empty,
we're done.

18:28.420 --> 18:29.586
Get a bottle.

18:29.621 --> 18:30.587
A bottle?
Mm-hmm.

18:30.622 --> 18:31.588
You sure?

18:31.622 --> 18:33.423
I'm sure, I swear.

18:33.457 --> 18:35.892
I swear!

18:35.926 --> 18:37.761
All:

18:37.795 --> 18:40.496

18:47.304 --> 18:49.939
Just checking in.
Checking... (Laughs)

18:49.973 --> 18:52.442
So, uh, how was
your son's recital?

18:52.476 --> 18:54.277
Oh, it was amazing.
Was it?

18:54.311 --> 18:56.145
Yeah, really fantastic--
not to be missed.

18:56.180 --> 18:57.614
Y-you know what?

18:57.648 --> 18:58.915
So was Mr. gladwell.

18:58.949 --> 19:00.317
Ooh, he was brilliant.

19:00.351 --> 19:03.019
Great. I wish that you
could've been there.

19:03.053 --> 19:04.954
Yeah, there's no goddamn way
I can keep doing this.

19:04.988 --> 19:06.522
I'm sorry.
Doing what?

19:06.556 --> 19:08.090
This, this passive aggressive
bullshit dance that we do

19:08.125 --> 19:09.959
whoa, whoa. While you try to handle me.

19:09.993 --> 19:11.160
I'm not following you. I
can't fucking take it, Jules.

19:11.194 --> 19:12.528
I'm not foll...
I'm sorry.

19:12.562 --> 19:14.330
Really, are you sure?
Because you're

19:14.364 --> 19:15.932
a lot of things, Jules,
but stupid isn't one

19:15.966 --> 19:17.934
of them.
Okay.

19:17.968 --> 19:19.869
Is this about to be real?

19:19.904 --> 19:21.972
What you're gonna say right now,
you're gonna hit me the real...

19:22.006 --> 19:23.673
The real straight talk?
Marty.

19:23.707 --> 19:24.941
Bring it.

19:24.975 --> 19:26.643
You should know
that this aggression...

19:26.677 --> 19:28.211
This aggression?

19:28.245 --> 19:30.179
This aggression of yours

19:30.214 --> 19:34.150
will no longer be tolerated
by this company.

19:34.184 --> 19:37.486
Is that straight enough for you?

19:44.060 --> 19:45.827
Yeah. (Clears throat)

19:45.862 --> 19:48.998
(Laughs) Yeah,
I'm sorry, it's, uh...

19:49.032 --> 19:50.299
(Groans)

19:50.333 --> 19:51.800
It's not gonna happen again.

19:51.835 --> 19:55.904
I so sincerely hope really
that you mean that

19:55.939 --> 19:58.840
because together I
know that we can do

19:58.875 --> 20:00.976
great things for this company.

20:01.010 --> 20:02.344
We all just...

20:02.378 --> 20:04.679
We have to know our place.

20:11.422 --> 20:14.258
(Quietly):

Hey, hey, Jeannie,
can I talk to you for a second?

20:44.092 --> 20:45.294
No.

20:45.328 --> 20:46.430
(Laughs) Come on.

20:46.464 --> 20:48.902
Hey, no, just take...
Just for one second.

20:48.936 --> 20:51.538
No, Doug.
(Laughs)

20:51.572 --> 20:53.874
No, Jeannie, for real,
honestly, please?

20:53.908 --> 20:55.876
Fine.
Okay, all right.

20:55.911 --> 20:57.945
Sorry, uh...

20:57.980 --> 21:00.815
Oh, they have...
Um...

21:00.849 --> 21:02.116
What, what's up?

21:02.151 --> 21:03.918
All right, so,
I'm just gonna...

21:03.953 --> 21:05.220
Come right out and ask.

21:05.254 --> 21:07.889
Do you think that
Clyde would ever, uh,

21:07.924 --> 21:09.124
hit on Sarah?

21:09.158 --> 21:10.626
(Inhales deeply)

21:10.660 --> 21:13.728
Yes, definitely. Why?

21:13.763 --> 21:15.563
Why-why?

21:15.598 --> 21:17.065
Because we're friends.

21:17.099 --> 21:19.567
Because...

21:19.601 --> 21:20.902
Doug?

21:20.936 --> 21:22.570
Oh, no, no, Doug.

21:22.604 --> 21:24.939
Clyde does not care about you.

21:24.974 --> 21:26.107
Clyde doesn't care about me.

21:26.142 --> 21:27.275
Clyde just cares about Clyde.

21:27.310 --> 21:29.177
That's...

21:29.212 --> 21:31.113
But you know that, right?

21:31.147 --> 21:33.248
Huh? Yeah.

21:33.283 --> 21:35.016
Yeah. (Laughs)

21:35.051 --> 21:36.685
It's Clyde.
Right.

21:36.719 --> 21:38.654
It's Clyde. No, that's
what I was saying.

21:38.688 --> 21:40.589
It's Clyde, classic Clyde.
Right.

21:40.623 --> 21:41.757
That's what you
were saying, okay.

21:41.791 --> 21:43.358
Water off a duck's back for me.

21:43.393 --> 21:46.128
Doug, there you are. Hello.
Yeah, you found me.

21:46.162 --> 21:47.863
I was looking for you.
I'm right here.

21:47.897 --> 21:49.264
You ready to call it a night? Yeah.

21:49.298 --> 21:51.466
I was just saying to Jeannie,
let's get out of here.

21:51.501 --> 21:52.868
Mm-hmm.
Okay, so, um...

21:52.902 --> 21:54.102
I can't find my purse.

21:54.137 --> 21:55.937
You lost it somewhere?

21:55.972 --> 21:57.639
Yeah, so I'm...
You want to...?

21:57.674 --> 21:59.174
Oh, gosh, yeah, of course.

21:59.209 --> 22:00.842
I'll, uh, I'm on the case.

22:00.877 --> 22:02.377
Okay.

22:02.411 --> 22:04.879
Good night, Jeannie.

22:04.914 --> 22:06.882
We're not gonna have
a problem, are we?

22:06.916 --> 22:08.884
Why would we have a problem?

22:08.918 --> 22:10.152
You know,

22:10.186 --> 22:12.487
your crush
that you have on Doug.

22:12.522 --> 22:14.990
(Laughs)

22:15.024 --> 22:17.293
I don't have a crush
on Doug. Mm-hmm, okay.

22:17.327 --> 22:19.495
I don't... no, Sarah,
I do not have a cru...

22:19.529 --> 22:22.464
I am not at all
interested in-in Doug.

22:22.499 --> 22:25.034
Great, so just leave it there.
Yeah. Okay.

22:25.068 --> 22:26.135
And we won't have any problems.

22:26.169 --> 22:28.070
Correct, correct.

22:28.104 --> 22:31.474
Great, then have a good night.

22:32.543 --> 22:36.674
The fuck is happening tonight?

22:36.708 --> 22:38.871
I tell everybody in the office.

22:38.905 --> 22:40.706
Ask this guy right now-- Doug?
No, you don't.

22:40.740 --> 22:42.007
Haven't I always said that
zanna's the hottest girl

22:42.041 --> 22:43.542
in the office?
And then he says...

22:43.576 --> 22:45.076
No, no, he says

22:45.110 --> 22:46.844
he'd let you blow him
if you lost ten pounds.

22:46.878 --> 22:48.679
That's a joke, that's a joke. Wha...?

22:48.713 --> 22:49.878
That's... he's just
kidding around.

22:49.913 --> 22:51.812
Well, thank you, Doug. Sorry. Zanna?

22:51.846 --> 22:53.347
Why would you have to
lose weight to blow me?

22:53.381 --> 22:54.514
Doug?

22:54.549 --> 22:56.649
What the fuck was that?

22:56.683 --> 22:58.551
I would like to know why
you don't respect me, Clyde.

22:58.585 --> 23:01.520
I don't know, maybe it's 'cause
you're a fucking cockblock?

23:01.555 --> 23:03.155
No, no, no, I mean it.
A real answer.

23:03.190 --> 23:04.690
Why don't you respect me?

23:04.725 --> 23:08.194
Are you being serious?
Yeah.

23:08.228 --> 23:09.695
All right, here it comes, Doug.

23:09.729 --> 23:11.931
This is what you want--
Doug, I respect you.

23:11.965 --> 23:13.666
Then why would you
hit on my girlfriend?

23:13.700 --> 23:15.367
Is that what this is about?

23:15.402 --> 23:17.937
Doug, I'm not trying to steal
your fucking girlfriend.

23:17.971 --> 23:20.372
Yeah, because you couldn't
steal my girlfriend.

23:20.407 --> 23:21.840
Aw... I...

23:23.410 --> 23:25.678
I can, I can if I wanted to.

23:25.712 --> 23:27.546
You know, Clyde,

23:27.581 --> 23:31.250
most people here think that
you're just a selfish asshole.

23:31.285 --> 23:34.187
But not me, I've never thought
that-- you know what I think?

23:34.221 --> 23:37.090
I think that you're a sad,
deeply insecure little man,

23:37.125 --> 23:39.860
who has to tear people down just
to feel better about himself.

23:39.895 --> 23:41.896
I do think that you are
a good person,

23:41.930 --> 23:45.299
but I feel truly sorry for you.

23:46.835 --> 23:48.703
(Quietly):
Yeah.

23:48.737 --> 23:51.439
Is this what you're like when
you start getting laid, man?

23:51.474 --> 23:52.807
'Cause honestly I don't like it.

23:52.841 --> 23:55.109
Well, I do.

23:56.312 --> 23:57.279
I really do.

23:57.313 --> 23:58.380
And if you'll excuse me,

23:58.414 --> 23:59.748
I'm gonna go

23:59.782 --> 24:01.950
and fuck
my really hot girlfriend.

24:06.356 --> 24:09.224
I'm saying you look
good out there, girl.

24:09.259 --> 24:11.226
Oh, am I taking you back?

24:11.260 --> 24:13.795
Maybe, I still got the moves.

24:13.829 --> 24:16.731
Mm, have you tried
the jacuzzi in your room yet?

24:16.765 --> 24:18.900
You do not have a
jacuzzi in your room.

24:18.934 --> 24:20.134
Yes, are you...

24:20.169 --> 24:21.769
Fuck.
You jealous?

24:21.804 --> 24:24.072
Well, I'm not gonna
be sleeping in a room

24:24.106 --> 24:26.340
that doesn't have a jacuzzi,
I'll tell you that, goddamn...

24:26.375 --> 24:28.109
Mm. It's just the
principle of the thing.

24:28.143 --> 24:30.411
So where we gonna sleep, Marty?

24:32.014 --> 24:33.681
(Laughing)

24:35.718 --> 24:37.085
What's with you?

24:37.119 --> 24:38.820
Where you...? I don't know, tonight...

24:38.855 --> 24:40.355
The sloppy drinking...

24:40.389 --> 24:42.758
Uh, first of all, I'm
not sloppy. Well...

24:42.792 --> 24:44.460
You've been off since
you got here, Tamara.

24:44.494 --> 24:47.429
Marty kaan, are you
concerned about me?

24:47.463 --> 24:49.931
Are you gonna tell me
what the fuck's up?

24:49.966 --> 24:50.932
No, I'm not.

24:50.967 --> 24:52.000
No.

24:52.035 --> 24:53.368
Not.

24:53.403 --> 24:55.938
Not unless
you tell me something,

24:55.972 --> 24:57.105
something deep.

24:57.140 --> 24:59.141
Something dark.

24:59.175 --> 25:01.143
Something nobody else knows.

25:01.177 --> 25:03.479
Mm-hmm.
(Clears throat)

25:03.513 --> 25:05.548
I'm leaving the company.

25:05.582 --> 25:08.183
What?

25:08.218 --> 25:10.319
When?

25:10.353 --> 25:11.787
I don't know.

25:11.822 --> 25:14.991
But I'm done with this bullshit.

25:15.025 --> 25:17.794
All this...

25:17.829 --> 25:21.666
Running in circles and this
bitch trying to handle me.

25:21.700 --> 25:24.369
I mean, I-I try
really fucking hard

25:24.403 --> 25:26.370
just to-to hang in here,

25:26.405 --> 25:30.173
and make this shit work,
but it's over, it's done.

25:32.710 --> 25:34.044
You know what I think?

25:34.078 --> 25:36.246
I think I got under
your skin a little bit.

25:37.415 --> 25:38.915
You did.

25:38.950 --> 25:40.884
Mm...

25:42.253 --> 25:44.654
So that's my deal.

25:44.689 --> 25:46.690
(Exhales)

25:47.926 --> 25:50.494
So, Kevin decides
to take this job

25:50.528 --> 25:52.095
in New York even
after we promised

25:52.130 --> 25:54.831
one another that once
the kids were old enough

25:54.866 --> 25:57.401
that my career
would take priority.

25:57.435 --> 25:59.403
(Sighs)

25:59.437 --> 26:02.174
He hasn't changed
much since b-school.

26:02.208 --> 26:05.777
No, no, he has not
changed at all actually.

26:07.246 --> 26:09.214
So, what does this mean?

26:09.248 --> 26:11.216
It means as far as I'm concerned

26:11.250 --> 26:13.285
my marriage is over.

26:19.492 --> 26:21.125
We're about to close
this area down.

26:21.160 --> 26:22.694
Thanks.

26:22.728 --> 26:24.228
Hey, what's your name again?

26:24.263 --> 26:25.797
Amy.
Amy.

26:25.831 --> 26:28.699
Have you been in the
jacuzzis in these rooms?

26:28.734 --> 26:30.701
As far as my bosses know,

26:30.736 --> 26:32.103
I have not.
Oh!

26:32.137 --> 26:34.640
You're a bad girl, Amy.
Oh, Amy.

26:34.674 --> 26:37.581
What about tonight--
you want to, um,

26:37.616 --> 26:40.055
want to try it out tonight--
I mean, it's open invitation.

26:40.089 --> 26:42.724
(Laughs)

26:42.758 --> 26:45.394
What?

26:45.428 --> 26:48.397
And frightened Marty runs away.

26:48.431 --> 26:51.403
You're such a pussy.

26:51.437 --> 26:54.806
How am I pussy for...

26:54.841 --> 26:57.275
Trying to have a three-way.

27:02.681 --> 27:04.115
(Scoffs)

27:07.485 --> 27:10.221
Ah, fuck.
