to get in and not get caught.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.206

09:59.473 --> 10:04.478

into her door cam footage.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.940
Oh.
But it was to find
any information I could.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.026
Yeah, of course. S-So
you just sort of hacked it?

10:10.067 --> 10:11.902

into her door cam footage.

to unlock the door.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.702

10:19.744 --> 10:21.370

10:50.650 --> 10:53.027
Oh, I need to take this. Sorry.
Okay.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.779
Hey, man, what's up?

10:54.820 --> 10:56.113
GENE:
Simmons demoted me.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.281
What?

10:57.323 --> 10:58.824
You're joking.
Yeah.

10:58.866 --> 11:00.785
I don't really want
to talk about it, but...

11:00.826 --> 11:02.953
look, for what it's worth,
I gave the new chief

11:02.995 --> 11:05.122
the recommendation
to keep you on.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.958
Well, I mean, thanks, mate,
but are you okay?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.752
Uh, it's whatever.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.545
I'm on traffic duty.

11:11.587 --> 11:12.755
Damn.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.090
Okay, well, listen,
call me later

11:14.131 --> 11:15.758
or we can get
a pint or something.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.551
Yeah, will do.

11:23.432 --> 11:26.102
Okay, so we're supposed to grab
our passports in 20 minutes.

11:26.143 --> 11:27.603
Then we head to the border.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.897
Which border?
Hot or cold?

11:29.939 --> 11:31.941
Um, uh, hot?

11:31.982 --> 11:33.275
(laughs):
Mexico it is.

11:33.317 --> 11:35.277
I am honestly happy
to never see Chicago again

11:35.319 --> 11:36.570
for the rest of my life.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.866
Uh...

11:40.908 --> 11:44.286
You know what, can we... can we,
can we actually make a stop?

11:44.328 --> 11:46.247
A stop? I-I don't think
we have much time.

11:46.288 --> 11:49.125
Please. It's-it's
really important.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.419
What, your parents?

11:51.460 --> 11:53.170
No.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.174
There's someone to see you.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.428
Hi.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.932
Hi.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.690
What do you want?

12:12.732 --> 12:15.359
Um...

12:15.401 --> 12:16.777
Well...

12:18.738 --> 12:20.865
I just...

12:20.906 --> 12:22.867
You said you
needed me,

12:22.908 --> 12:26.078
and I'm sorry, I haven't
been there, but...

12:26.120 --> 12:27.580
I have to go.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.249
For a long time.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.001
Right.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.086
Because
you killed someone.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.588
Uh, no, I...

12:35.629 --> 12:38.174
Love that you're still
lying to me.

12:38.215 --> 12:39.550
I'm not lying.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.343
Whatever.

12:41.385 --> 12:44.555
Now that you're here,
could you do me a favor?

12:44.597 --> 12:46.474
Could you get me

12:46.515 --> 12:49.518
some more of those pills
that I took?

12:49.560 --> 12:51.395
My friends
won't do it.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.730
What?

12:53.981 --> 12:56.066
That landed you in the hospital.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.819
So? It was worth it.

12:58.861 --> 12:59.945
No, it wasn't.

12:59.987 --> 13:01.947
Yeah, it was.

13:01.989 --> 13:05.075
To just not care

13:05.117 --> 13:07.912
about anything that happened?

13:07.953 --> 13:10.748
(exhales)

13:10.790 --> 13:13.918
I-I get it. I get...

13:13.959 --> 13:17.421
how good it feels
to not feel anything,

13:17.463 --> 13:18.923
to numb everything,

13:18.964 --> 13:20.966
but that doesn't
end well.

13:21.008 --> 13:23.052
Okay? Look what happened to me.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.470
Really?

13:24.512 --> 13:26.847
You can't do this anymore.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.518
You could die.

13:30.559 --> 13:34.355
Don't you get it? I don't care.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.360
You don't mean that.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.864
I do.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.367
I actually do.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.161
Don't say that, please.

13:49.912 --> 13:55.668
If you're just gonna lecture me,
I have my dumb uncle for that.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.713
You can go.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.591
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Text from Amber.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.886
On my way home from school now,
can I bring you anything?

14:05.928 --> 14:09.139
Please leave me alone, Murphy.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.391
Please.

14:10.432 --> 14:12.810
Just leave me alone.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.403
(sniffles)

14:31.078 --> 14:32.746
We can't go.

14:33.706 --> 14:34.915
What?

14:34.957 --> 14:36.709
That drug really messed her up.

14:38.002 --> 14:39.837
It ruined her. She's willing

14:39.879 --> 14:42.339
to throw her life away.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.842
I can't let Trey
get away with that.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.970
I thought I--
I thought we... (sighs)

14:48.012 --> 14:49.346
I thought we could just run away

14:49.388 --> 14:51.974
and then I would not
think about it, but I...

14:54.518 --> 14:56.395
...I can't.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.938
She's messed up.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.484
If you don't want him
to get away with it,

15:02.526 --> 15:04.862
then he won't.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.114
Okay?

15:07.156 --> 15:08.449
Serious?

15:08.490 --> 15:10.034
Yeah.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.827
I love you so much.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.537
I love you too, Murph.
Thank you.

15:16.165 --> 15:18.584
I'm gonna call Gene, okay?

15:18.626 --> 15:20.294
(car doors close)

15:23.631 --> 15:25.382
There's a step there.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.264
You look like you're having fun.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.892
Yeah, just pulled over
an 82-year-old woman

15:34.934 --> 15:37.102
trying to make it to her
grandson's soccer game.

15:37.144 --> 15:39.063
Really fighting
the good fight, you know?

15:39.104 --> 15:40.230
What's up?

15:40.272 --> 15:43.317
Um... It was Trey.

15:45.402 --> 15:47.738
Who was Trey?
In the club.

15:47.780 --> 15:51.951
It was Trey,
and we let him get away.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.494
You what?
It wasn't my idea.

15:53.535 --> 15:54.662
No, wait a minute, I don't...

15:54.703 --> 15:57.081
I don't want to hear that.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.833
Do you understand,
I lost my job today?

15:59.875 --> 16:01.835
We can still get him.
No, we can't!

16:01.877 --> 16:04.088
Okay, I know-- I recognize
you can't see me right now,

16:04.129 --> 16:06.924
but I am far from anything
that resembles power.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.384
Who cares, you're
still a cop right?

16:08.425 --> 16:09.843
(scoffs)

16:09.885 --> 16:12.012
I-I obviously
made a mistake.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.556
But Trey is the one
that's killing people.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.183
Killing kids.

16:16.225 --> 16:19.019
Okay? So, yes,
he-he got away for now,

16:19.061 --> 16:22.272
but now we at least
know who's running this thing.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.650
Don't let him get away
because you're mad at me.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.610
You're better
than that.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.195
Come on, Gene.

16:31.949 --> 16:34.368
I'm on thin ice right now
with my boss.

16:37.204 --> 16:38.956
I got to make
my stupid ticket quota,

16:38.998 --> 16:40.374
but I'm-a call you
when I'm done.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.419
Thank you. Thank you.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.379
I'm not doing this for you.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.761
Uh, anyway, y-you
can't tell Darnell.

16:52.803 --> 16:55.723
I know.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.057
SARAH:
Hey.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.643
Hey.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.146
You okay?

17:03.856 --> 17:05.566
I don't know.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.485
Yeah, I get it.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.487
We got into this
because we actually wanted

17:10.529 --> 17:12.114
to make things better.

17:14.366 --> 17:18.287
And it turns out

17:18.328 --> 17:24.084
that it's just red tape
and corruption

17:24.126 --> 17:25.836
at the top.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.422
And for what?

17:31.633 --> 17:33.761
Maybe I'm done.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.847
Done?

17:36.889 --> 17:39.683
No. No, you can't quit.

17:39.725 --> 17:40.934
Come on, Sarah.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.525
(sighs)

17:48.567 --> 17:50.861
(sniffles)

17:50.903 --> 17:53.363
I just can't believe
I did this to Darnell.

17:53.405 --> 17:58.368
So, you're thinking
about quitting?

17:58.410 --> 18:00.746
I don't... I don't understand.

18:00.788 --> 18:03.248
There's only so much
that he can take.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.669
(sighs)
Sarah...

18:07.711 --> 18:11.548
No, look, I am not the kind
of person that throws away

18:11.590 --> 18:14.384
her whole career
for some dude, but...

18:14.426 --> 18:16.929
We're not even doing
any good anymore.

18:16.970 --> 18:18.889
So what's the point?

18:20.849 --> 18:22.559
So let me get this straight.

18:22.601 --> 18:25.562
You're thinking about walking
away from your job for Darnell?

18:25.604 --> 18:27.898
My job almost got
Darnell killed.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.734
I know, but...
I am the reason for that.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.486
No, you aren't.
I am.

18:32.528 --> 18:35.572
I put him in a really,
really dangerous situation

18:35.614 --> 18:37.991
because I thought
it could help our investigation.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.078
If that's the kind of person

18:41.120 --> 18:44.540
that this job
turns someone into,

18:44.581 --> 18:46.166
I don't want it.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.839
I care about this person.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.008
A lot.

18:58.554 --> 19:02.850
Don't throw your
career away for him.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.356
It was Trey in the club.

19:12.192 --> 19:14.403
Darnell let him go.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.332
(sighs)
What's going on?

19:27.374 --> 19:29.960
You tell me.
(laughs softly)

19:30.002 --> 19:32.796
I really wouldn't know.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.049
It was Trey.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.427
Sarah...

19:38.468 --> 19:39.595
Don't even. Don't even.

19:39.636 --> 19:42.389
You made a total fool out of me.

19:42.431 --> 19:46.643
God, I really trusted you.

19:46.685 --> 19:47.644
I thought that...

19:47.686 --> 19:49.980
We...
Clearly, we're not.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.566
I can explain.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.443
Oh, you can explain?

19:54.484 --> 19:56.320
Why don't you explain it
to all the parents

19:56.361 --> 19:58.488
who will never see
their kids again,

19:58.530 --> 19:59.990
thanks to your buddy.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.826
I feel sick for them, I do.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.329
But I am telling you,
this is not Trey's fault.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.289
Oh, my God.
You're a cop.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.750
You see things
as either good or bad,

20:09.791 --> 20:11.752
but it's not like that.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.670
God, I'm such an idiot.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.507
I thought you'd turned a corner.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.926
I have.

20:18.967 --> 20:21.470
This is a joke.

20:21.511 --> 20:24.598
You claim that you want to help
all these street kids.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.100
It's not about that.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.228
You actually want to clear
your guilt

20:29.269 --> 20:32.439
because you think
Tyson's dead because of you.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.901
Go to therapy or something
and leave me out of it.

20:37.861 --> 20:39.780
Just get out
of my house.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.667
(door closes)

21:00.092 --> 21:01.718
Are you sure this worked?

21:01.760 --> 21:04.263
She won't see us
on the door cam?
See?

21:04.304 --> 21:06.265
We're nowhere
to be found.
How did you do that?

21:06.306 --> 21:08.183
I don't reveal my secrets.

21:09.851 --> 21:11.270
Okay, so what are
we looking for?

21:11.311 --> 21:14.147
Drugs, guns.

21:14.189 --> 21:15.774
Anything to incriminate Murphy.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.526
Okay.
Yeah.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.489
All right. Here we are.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.158
Uh, carpet's kind of
torn, so be careful.

21:27.577 --> 21:29.204
Cool place.

21:29.246 --> 21:29.955
Yeah, my brother
owns it.

21:29.997 --> 21:34.710
He's redoing it right now,
so he said we can hide out here.

21:35.752 --> 21:37.379
MAX:
Watch your step here.

21:40.841 --> 21:42.551
God, it smells so bad in here.

21:42.592 --> 21:45.095
Ooh. Sorry.
(chuckles)

21:45.137 --> 21:47.597
Okay, so...

21:47.639 --> 21:50.058
What you, what you thinking?

21:51.977 --> 21:54.646
About? What are we-- What?

21:54.688 --> 21:55.939
What are we thinking?

21:55.981 --> 21:58.483
How you plan to take Trey down.

21:58.525 --> 22:01.903
MAX:
We know who it is now,
so go arrest him.

22:01.945 --> 22:03.405
Okay.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.824
Okay.

22:05.866 --> 22:09.536
Okay, see, unfortunately,
that requires evidence.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.163
Something we would have had,
had we, uh,

22:11.204 --> 22:12.664
caught him in the act
of holding you hostage.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.333
Okay, I-- Please,
can we move on?

22:14.374 --> 22:16.126
Okay.
I apologized, Gene. I'm sorry.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.794
I sort of lost my dream job
because of it,

22:17.836 --> 22:19.629
so, uh, forgive me if I don't
give you a hug just yet.

22:19.671 --> 22:21.798
What do you want me to say?
Guys, stop.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.258
If Murphy doesn't hold up
her end of the deal,

22:23.300 --> 22:24.801
the chief
will revoke it.

22:24.843 --> 22:27.637
So we have to figure
this out in a hurry.

22:27.679 --> 22:29.848
Trey gave me 50 grand.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.392
What?

22:32.434 --> 22:35.520
He gave me hush money.

22:35.562 --> 22:38.231
Can we check that for
fingerprints or something?

22:38.273 --> 22:42.736
Trey touching $50,000
isn't illegal, Murphy.

22:44.696 --> 22:47.616
Well, clearly product
or money from selling product

22:47.657 --> 22:49.034
is gonna pass through
the club at some point,

22:49.076 --> 22:51.286
so maybe put
a surveillance team on it.
Oh!

22:51.328 --> 22:53.580
Thank you for that tip.
I know how to do my job, Max.

22:53.622 --> 22:56.124
Mm.
Look around, man.
I'm at the bottom.

22:56.166 --> 22:59.252
I can't put
any teams on anything.

23:05.801 --> 23:10.222
But for the time being,
I can still make arrests.

23:10.263 --> 23:13.433
So if we catch Trey
in the act, I can charge him.

23:13.475 --> 23:14.935
We just don't have
a ton of protection,

23:14.976 --> 23:18.855
and we're going after
a pretty big beast here.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.816
So if we're gonna take a shot,

23:20.857 --> 23:22.859
we can't miss.

Get down here.

There's, like, a-a bag
that looks like drugs, I think.

Okay, thank you, Dr. Meyers.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.211
What did he say?

25:04.252 --> 25:05.837
Uh...

25:06.379 --> 25:10.675
Uh, he said it was
stress-induced blindness.

25:10.717 --> 25:12.844
I-I knew it was a thing,
I just...

25:12.886 --> 25:14.930
it never happened before.

25:14.971 --> 25:17.516

Yeah, makes it worse.

25:17.557 --> 25:19.726
It's back a bit now,

25:19.768 --> 25:23.021
but the doctor says I need
to find some coping mechanisms.

25:23.063 --> 25:26.942
Otherwise my condition will
degrade at a more rapid rate.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.282

I have to stop all this.

26:06.523 --> 26:08.108
Yeah, probably.

You know, all I wanted this
whole time is just the truth.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.157

but I just, I...

26:24.749 --> 26:26.126
I needed it.

if we could get enough evidence

26:31.798 --> 26:34.968
or-or something...

26:37.721 --> 26:40.390

to killing Nia.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.976
You know,
admit that she used me.

29:04.868 --> 29:05.994
Cool.

29:06.035 --> 29:07.537
I could use the help.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.706
I don't know
if you could tell, but...

29:09.748 --> 29:11.833
business is going really well.

29:11.875 --> 29:14.878
Yeah, clearly. Clearly.

How the hell
did all this happen, man?

29:16.671 --> 29:18.757

29:18.798 --> 29:20.425
I'm running it.

29:20.467 --> 29:22.010
But there's this rich
white real estate guy,

29:22.051 --> 29:23.970
he's funding
the entire operation.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.764
Word?

29:25.805 --> 29:27.640
With money like his,

29:27.682 --> 29:30.018
we can get things
off the ground pretty quickly.

29:40.236 --> 29:41.404
20%.

29:41.446 --> 29:45.074
But we make 48 bucks
on every pill.

29:45.116 --> 29:48.286
So, wait, I sold Bolt.

29:48.328 --> 29:49.621
It's 50 bucks.

29:49.662 --> 29:51.748
You're saying it costs
two dollars to make?

29:51.790 --> 29:53.708

29:57.962 --> 30:00.673
Yeah. It's, uh...

30:02.634 --> 30:03.843
...economical.

30:05.094 --> 30:07.514
Yeah, but I mean...

30:07.555 --> 30:10.850
You know, kids are taking
this thing, too, dude.

30:12.310 --> 30:13.686

It's just business.

30:20.652 --> 30:26.533
Anyway, do you think you could

30:26.574 --> 30:30.537

30:30.578 --> 30:33.540

30:33.581 --> 30:36.042

30:36.084 --> 30:37.627
All right.

30:44.008 --> 30:46.719
Don't bills have,
like, serial numbers?

30:46.761 --> 30:48.805
Can we use that?
To do what?

30:48.847 --> 30:51.808
To-to trace them back
to wherever they came from,

30:51.850 --> 30:52.934
or something?

30:52.976 --> 30:54.310
It's not like a GPS.

30:54.352 --> 30:55.061
And I'm not like a cop.

30:55.103 --> 30:57.897
But why-- why am I the only
one coming up with anything?

30:57.939 --> 30:59.566
The only one?
Do you have anything to offer?

30:59.607 --> 31:01.609

31:04.821 --> 31:06.614
Absolutely not.

31:09.367 --> 31:10.952
I'm serious. Leave.
Listen to me. Please,

31:10.994 --> 31:12.495
just hear me out.
She said leave, man.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.455
Please, just hear me out.

31:14.497 --> 31:16.958
Trey thinks
I'm in with him, okay?

31:18.042 --> 31:19.294

31:19.335 --> 31:20.461
I'm deep on the inside.

31:20.503 --> 31:22.297

I'm with you guys.

31:26.342 --> 31:27.719
All right?

31:29.262 --> 31:31.014
You were right.

31:31.055 --> 31:33.099
About everything.

31:33.141 --> 31:36.811
Trey's cutting his pills
with fentanyl.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.690
He knows
he's killing kids.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.692
Murphy told us it was your idea
to let him walk this morning.

31:42.734 --> 31:43.902
I know,
and I was wrong.

31:43.943 --> 31:47.280
I got caught up in my emotions.

31:47.322 --> 31:51.784
Something I think everyone here
has done at least once or twice.

31:51.826 --> 31:56.289
Look, I already found out
more about Bolt

31:56.331 --> 31:58.875
in one meeting with Trey

31:58.917 --> 32:01.753
than the entire time
we've been working on this.

32:01.794 --> 32:04.881
He's got some investor,
some rich real estate guy

32:04.923 --> 32:06.007
who's funding it all.

32:06.049 --> 32:09.135
If we can figure out
who that is,

32:09.177 --> 32:11.387
we can cut the entire thing
off at the source.

32:11.429 --> 32:13.514
How do we know you're not lying?

32:16.893 --> 32:19.896
I know you have no reason
to trust me. I get that.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.065
But I swear to you.

32:25.151 --> 32:27.654
I swear on Tyson's grave,
Murphy.

32:27.695 --> 32:30.531
I am with you.

32:30.573 --> 32:32.992
I'm with you.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.747
He's telling the truth.

32:39.082 --> 32:41.042

nothing else, so...

32:51.219 --> 32:53.262
Fine, we'll work with you.

32:53.304 --> 32:56.724
But you know taking
down the Bolt operation

32:56.766 --> 32:59.227
means taking Trey down
with it, right?

33:00.937 --> 33:02.146
I know.

34:45.500 --> 34:46.876
whatever he wants to hear.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.586
MURPHY:
What he wants to hear
is that I'm gonna

34:48.628 --> 34:51.255
rot in prison for
the rest of my life.

34:51.297 --> 34:53.382
We all know he's not gonna
accept anything other than that.

34:53.424 --> 34:54.634
He's crazy.
SARAH:
He's here.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.351
(sighs)

35:06.020 --> 35:07.980
Hey, man.
JOSH: Hey, man.

35:10.149 --> 35:12.777
You all right?

35:12.819 --> 35:14.987
Hey. Thanks
for meeting me, man.

35:16.989 --> 35:18.449
I've had a brutal day.

35:18.491 --> 35:21.035
I know you have too, sorry.
Oh... Yeah, no, it's cool.

35:21.077 --> 35:24.038
Uh, but I have to say, I'm not
much of a bowler these days.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.915
Hey, Josh, listen.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.875
What the hell is going on?

35:27.917 --> 35:30.461
GENE:
I knew if I told you I was
with Murphy, you wouldn't come.

35:30.503 --> 35:32.463
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
What's she doing here?

35:32.505 --> 35:35.174
GENE:
She's helping me with
the investigation, okay?

35:35.216 --> 35:36.926
Just give me a second
to explain.
Helping?

35:36.968 --> 35:38.803
You-you gave
her a deal?
No.

35:38.845 --> 35:40.763
That's why she
got a mistrial.
No.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.306
Okay.
So you're doing this

35:42.348 --> 35:43.307
out of the kindness
of own heart?

35:43.349 --> 35:44.308
Yes, I am!

35:44.350 --> 35:46.060
JOSH: Sure.
She is.

35:47.687 --> 35:48.771
Josh, Chloe was
in the hospital...
JOSH: You're lying!

35:48.813 --> 35:50.022
I'm not listening

35:50.064 --> 35:51.691
to a word you say.
GENE:
Josh.

35:51.732 --> 35:53.109
JOSH:
And you, I can't believe
you did this to me, mate.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.277
Josh.

35:54.318 --> 35:56.195
Josh, stop.

36:03.286 --> 36:04.537
Josh?

36:14.255 --> 36:15.631
(Josh panting)

36:15.673 --> 36:16.716
Josh?

36:18.676 --> 36:20.052
You all right?

36:23.723 --> 36:25.558
Let me help you.

36:33.608 --> 36:35.484
GENE:
All right, we're
gonna turn left here.

36:35.526 --> 36:38.237
There's a wall to your
right. There you go.

36:43.993 --> 36:45.661
(sniffles)

36:45.703 --> 36:48.372
It's m-my eyesight.

36:48.414 --> 36:51.334
It'll come back in a minute.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.461
This happened earlier today?

36:53.502 --> 36:54.712
Yeah.

36:56.672 --> 36:58.674
You...

36:58.716 --> 37:01.844
You really, you really didn't
give her a deal?

37:03.888 --> 37:07.141
No. No, man,
I w-- I wouldn't do that.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.897
So she really is doing
all of this just for Chloe?

37:12.939 --> 37:14.607
Yeah.

37:16.275 --> 37:18.194
Wow.
(sniffles)

37:18.236 --> 37:19.654
Well, I'm sorry, man.

37:19.695 --> 37:21.197
I'm sorry, man,
I didn't believe you.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.448
Of course you wouldn't
do something like that.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.867
I just--
I, uh, I'm sorry.
Mm-mm. Mm...

37:24.909 --> 37:27.662
It's okay. It's okay.

37:27.703 --> 37:29.997
I do want to help you, though.

37:31.582 --> 37:33.209
Yeah?
Yeah.

37:33.251 --> 37:38.005
But I'm gonna need something
from Murphy first.

37:41.092 --> 37:43.135
GENE:
There's a chair
right in front of you.

37:43.177 --> 37:44.345
There you go.

37:47.682 --> 37:49.642
I'll give you guys
some privacy.

37:49.684 --> 37:52.228
(exhales)

37:52.270 --> 37:53.646
(clears throat)

38:01.404 --> 38:03.781
What can I do for you, Josh?

38:05.741 --> 38:08.077
Admit that you
killed Nia Bailey.

38:10.037 --> 38:11.706
That's what you want?

38:11.747 --> 38:12.957
Yes.

38:14.208 --> 38:15.543
Are you really this petty?

38:15.584 --> 38:18.087
Come on.
Petty? (scoffs)

38:18.129 --> 38:20.006
You think that this is petty?

38:20.047 --> 38:22.133
Listen, listen, I just,

38:22.174 --> 38:24.176
I need the truth.
You want the truth?

38:25.886 --> 38:28.097
The truth is,

38:28.139 --> 38:30.808
I didn't kill her.

38:30.850 --> 38:31.976
I've never killed anyone.

38:32.018 --> 38:33.728
But w-why are you
still lying to me?

38:33.769 --> 38:37.815
I'm not lying, Josh.
I'm not lying. I-I don't...

38:40.985 --> 38:45.656
Listen, I spent my entire
career trying to catch Nia.

38:45.698 --> 38:48.492
My entire career
trying to catch Nia.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

38:48.534 --> 38:50.953
And-and-and...

38:50.995 --> 38:54.457
you just, you used me.

38:54.498 --> 38:55.833
Hmm.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.378
Well, I didn't use you.

39:00.671 --> 39:02.381
I actually liked you.

39:03.966 --> 39:06.886
Sure.
I did.

39:06.927 --> 39:09.638
You were like this...

39:09.680 --> 39:14.018
this sliver of-of good and...

39:14.060 --> 39:15.227
(laughs)

39:15.269 --> 39:18.439
Um, I mean, I...

39:18.481 --> 39:19.732
I fell for you.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.153
Then you turned
into a complete psycho.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.905
(chuckles)

39:25.946 --> 39:29.950
You're the reason I'm
this complete psycho.

39:29.992 --> 39:32.703
I think it was kind of brewing.

39:32.745 --> 39:34.330
(chuckles)

39:34.372 --> 39:36.165
See, I really liked you, too.

39:36.207 --> 39:39.835
I mean, I-I really liked you,
and-and that's why all of this,

39:39.877 --> 39:43.005
all of this, that's why
it was so hard on me.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.257
Yeah. Okay.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.761
I hear you.

39:48.803 --> 39:51.180
Um...

39:51.222 --> 39:53.682
I guess, for what
it's worth, uh...

39:53.724 --> 39:55.851
I'm really sorry.

40:00.815 --> 40:02.691
(grunts)

40:02.733 --> 40:04.026
What are you doing?
(laughs)

40:04.068 --> 40:05.903
Wow. I...

40:05.945 --> 40:08.072
I think about you so much.

40:08.114 --> 40:10.658
The way you smell.

40:10.699 --> 40:13.119
The way you...
The way you taste.

40:15.996 --> 40:18.541
Josh, come on.

40:18.582 --> 40:20.793
(chuckles):
What? It's okay.

40:20.835 --> 40:23.212
It's okay, look-- this is...

40:23.254 --> 40:24.380
Hey, come on.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.549
Get off me, you freak.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.261
What?

40:30.302 --> 40:33.514
But you... You-you owe me.

40:33.556 --> 40:35.015
I don't owe you anything.

40:35.057 --> 40:37.309
Well... (scoffs)

40:39.270 --> 40:40.396
You...

40:40.438 --> 40:41.981
It's...

40:42.022 --> 40:43.524
Stop it.

40:45.734 --> 40:48.487
Listen, if you're not
gonna give me that,

40:48.529 --> 40:50.114
then I need to hear it

40:50.156 --> 40:52.741
from your mouth that
you killed Nia Bailey.

40:52.783 --> 40:55.619
(grunts)
Say it. Say it.

40:55.661 --> 40:57.246
Say it.

40:57.288 --> 41:00.332
You need my help, so say it!

41:04.879 --> 41:06.297
Okay, listen to me.

41:06.338 --> 41:08.841
Listen to me.
(whimpering)

41:10.301 --> 41:13.762
You're on your own, bitch.
