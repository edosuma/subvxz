09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Just be confident.
We're the top dog.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.520
Just be confident.
We're the top dog.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.160
We're the top dogs.
I don't think we are.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.680
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, my goodness!

10:03.720 --> 10:05.600
All good? All good?
No, I'm great. OK, top dog.

10:05.640 --> 10:06.920
You know, what?
Be confident and laugh.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.960
(LAUGHTER)

10:11.360 --> 10:12.440
Get down!

10:14.040 --> 10:15.320
What the bloody hell
are youse doing?

10:15.360 --> 10:17.240
Youse are meant
to use the back gate.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.360
Hey.
Oh, hi, we didn't realise.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.400
There was one. Sorry.

10:19.440 --> 10:22.280
Yeah, you're right.
You droppin' off or pickin' up?

10:22.320 --> 10:25.360
Ahh, potentially dropping off.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.440
Legs buggered?
Ahh, yes.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.560
Does it come with the rig?

10:30.600 --> 10:32.360
Yes, he needs them.
The rig is... Yeah.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.320
Sweet.
OK.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.160
So, do you have... Ooh!

10:37.200 --> 10:39.880
Any experience
with special needs dogs?

10:39.920 --> 10:42.360
Dogs are dogs, love.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.040
$300 for drop off.
OK.

10:45.080 --> 10:46.800
Ahh, he might need
his urine expressed, though.

10:46.840 --> 10:50.080
Do you know, how to do that?
Yeah, no worries.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.600
But...but do you know how to do it?

10:51.640 --> 10:53.160
You droppin' off or not?

10:53.200 --> 10:56.480
Ahh, well, possibly,
but this is a high-needs dog.

10:56.520 --> 10:59.320
Nah, youse are high-needs people.

10:59.360 --> 11:00.000
Dogs are dogs. Shut up, Bobo.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.360
Dogs are dogs. Shut up, Bobo.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.880
Gordon, I really...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:03.920 --> 11:04.920
I think we should go.
Yeah.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.200
Bugger youse then.
Fricken time wasters.

11:07.240 --> 11:08.880
Sorry, Jenny.
Come on, Bobby.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.160
Come on. Come on, inside.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.200
Right, here he comes.
Good boy. Come on! Inside!

11:13.240 --> 11:14.680
Good boy.
Come on!

11:14.720 --> 11:15.880
Gordon, you've backed me up
against the gate.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.240
Alright, can we...
I can't open the fucking gate.

11:17.280 --> 11:18.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Move forward.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.000
Jesus Christ.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.360
Yeah, I mean, so,
Jenny's definitely not vaccinated.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.480
Wouldn't have thought so.

11:25.800 --> 11:26.800
Bretty.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.960
Hey, mate, the neighbours
are still looking for a dog.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.760
Oh, really?
Oh, what?

11:30.800 --> 11:33.680
They said that...that rescue place
was a bit weird.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.240
A bit? Fucken hell.
My god.

11:36.280 --> 11:39.280
Anyway, Phoebe is the Mum's name.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.760
I'll text you all her dets
and she'll be expecting your call.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.200
But they're a really nice family.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.760
OK. Yep, sounds good man.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.520
Thanks, Brett.
Did...did Meggles text?

11:48.560 --> 11:51.200
Yeah. She... Yeah.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.560
Is everything OK?

11:53.600 --> 11:56.200
Yep. Yep. Yep.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.160
It's cool. Cool, cool.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.640
What's that mean?

11:59.680 --> 12:00.000
Ahh, nah. All good.
She did, thanks.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.080
Ahh, nah. All good.
She did, thanks.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.120
Anyways, gotta crack on. OK.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.520
OK.
Alright.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.760
See ya.
Bye.

12:09.480 --> 12:10.560
Ooh!

12:10.600 --> 12:12.320
OK.

12:12.360 --> 12:13.840
What do you think,
should we do this?

12:13.880 --> 12:16.280
Yeah, I mean,
anything's better than that.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.120
(LAUGHTER)

12:21.160 --> 12:22.160
Yeah.

12:22.200 --> 12:25.040
Oh, and it turned out
the British guy, Nigel.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.080
Yeah?

12:26.120 --> 12:28.120
Yeah, is some drug dealer mate
of Roman's.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.840
What?
Sorry, what British guy?

12:29.880 --> 12:31.040
The one that fell out the window.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.200
Sorry, someone fell out the window?
Yeah.

12:35.240 --> 12:36.240
Well, did he survive?

12:36.280 --> 12:39.160
Yeah, but now he's suing us.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.040
What!
Gordon told me you'd freak out.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.120
Freak out?
Yes!

12:42.160 --> 12:43.280
What was he doing up there?
I don't know!

12:43.320 --> 12:45.080
Maybe I should go.
BOTH: No, no, no.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.120
Sorry, that's so...

12:46.160 --> 12:47.640
This is so boring.
Don't do that, no.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.640
We don't want to hear
about all this work stuff.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.360
OK.
You didn't come here for that.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.840
Did you?

12:53.880 --> 12:55.160
No, you did not come here

12:55.200 --> 12:57.880
so, that you could hear about Brett
and Gordon's incompetence.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.000
Hey guys, is a debit card OK?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.240
Hey guys, is a debit card OK?

13:01.280 --> 13:03.200
Oh, no, no, no, this is on us.
Yeah.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.760
No, no, no, for the party.
It's $500, yeah?

13:06.800 --> 13:07.960
You're paying for the whole party?

13:09.560 --> 13:10.560
Um, yeah.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.960
I...I think Ash got the impression
that Gordon would pay,

13:13.000 --> 13:14.120
which is... which is our bad.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.200
Meggles, look, Gordo can pay
for his girlfriend's party.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.240
Come on.

13:18.280 --> 13:20.720
Ahh, actually I think they broke up.

13:20.760 --> 13:21.800
BOTH: Oh.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.520
Well, whatever.
You're not paying for this.

13:24.560 --> 13:25.560
Is she, Chi?

13:25.600 --> 13:29.000
No, way. No, no, no.
This is on us.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.120
Yeah.
Are you serious?

13:30.160 --> 13:31.320
Yep. Deadly.
Yeah.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.800
Oh, my god, thank you guys.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.720
Thank you so much. You're the best.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.120
OK.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.560
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.560
Thank you really.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.680
Thank you, Bretty, mwah.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.720
You guys are fucking legends.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.960
Oh, you're a legend.
Oh, you are.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.560
And I just...

13:51.600 --> 13:53.960
I hope I didn't make too much
of a dick of myself at the party.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.760
No, hey, hey,
we had some really good chats.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.880
Yeah, so, did we.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.000
It's embarrassing for me

14:00.000 --> 14:00.200
It's embarrassing for me

14:00.240 --> 14:03.880
because I actually don't remember
anything after shots.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.000
I was wasted.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.280
Yeah, me too. You think I remember?

14:06.320 --> 14:07.440
Oh, for sure.
I don't...

14:07.480 --> 14:08.600
Sorry, was I even talking to you?

14:08.640 --> 14:10.520
(INDISTINCT TALK)

14:12.080 --> 14:14.000
What'd we even... Did we talk.
Yeah. Exactly.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.360
I don't know, did we talk?

14:15.400 --> 14:17.360
(LAUGHTER)
OK, OK.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.840
Thank you. Thanks, guys.

14:18.880 --> 14:20.240
Thank you for coming in.
See ya.

14:20.280 --> 14:21.320
Yeah!
Yep.

14:23.480 --> 14:26.480
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

14:51.440 --> 14:53.560
Can I have a...
Shut up! Shut up.

15:01.760 --> 15:02.840
Third time lucky.

15:04.840 --> 15:05.920
(BELL TOLLS)

15:08.880 --> 15:10.280
Hi!
Hi.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.560
I'm Phoebe. Hi, Gordon and Ashley.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.240
Hello, Phoebe, how are you?

15:14.280 --> 15:16.600
Oh, there you are!

15:16.640 --> 15:19.160
Look at this precious little man.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.920
Hello! Oh, kisses!

15:22.960 --> 15:24.920
Oh, kisses. Thank you!

15:27.880 --> 15:30.960
Please, come on in.
Would you like a coffee, or a tea?

15:31.000 --> 15:34.200
BOTH: Oh.
Um...
Do you wanna...

15:34.240 --> 15:35.280
Oh, please you can meet Angus

15:35.320 --> 15:38.200
and Berlin is so excited
to meet this little guy.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.360
Yeah, OK.
Yes, great.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come in!

15:40.640 --> 15:43.640
(SOFT MUSIC)

15:47.920 --> 15:49.040
You have frizzy hair.

15:51.360 --> 15:52.640
What do I have?

15:52.680 --> 15:54.520
Frizzy hair.
Oh, do I?

15:54.560 --> 15:57.200
She does, yeah, yeah.
My Mum's prettier.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.600
Oop!
Berlin!

16:02.400 --> 16:05.360
Our chihuahua, Peppy, died
the year before last.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.280
He was 18, you know.

16:07.320 --> 16:10.160
So, it really took us
a long time to get over it.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.320
Oh, yeah, I bet.

16:12.360 --> 16:13.840
Good innings.
BOTH: Mm.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.800
And when Brett's Mum, Diana,
told us about this dog

16:15.840 --> 16:19.200
we just thought,
you precious little thing.

16:19.240 --> 16:22.240
And seeing him here, he really is.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.360
Yeah, he's very special.
Yeah.

16:25.560 --> 16:28.960
Did she mention that
he might need help doing a wee,

16:29.000 --> 16:30.240
going to the toilet in time?

16:30.280 --> 16:33.120
Yep, already YouTubed that
and ready to go, so...

16:33.160 --> 16:34.440
Oh.
Oh, wow.

16:34.480 --> 16:35.480
That's great.

16:35.520 --> 16:36.560
Yeah.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.680
And if...if I could ask one favour?

16:38.720 --> 16:39.720
Sure.

16:39.760 --> 16:42.560
If you wouldn't mind not
changing his name

16:42.600 --> 16:44.480
because it would be his third name

16:44.520 --> 16:47.160
and it just might be
a bit confusing for him.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.800
What was... What was his name again?

16:48.840 --> 16:53.880
Colin.
Yeah.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.840
Yeah, it's a weird name for a dog.
Mm.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.000
Yeah, don't love it.

17:00.040 --> 17:03.200
Ahh, well, I mean,
something then that sounds like,

17:03.240 --> 17:05.920
you know, ah, like Corin?

17:05.960 --> 17:07.000
Corin?

17:08.040 --> 17:10.000
Or Gollum?
Gollum.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.599
From 'Lord Of The Rings'.
Yeah, nah.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.160
What do you want
to call him, Berlin?

17:15.200 --> 17:16.280
Peppy!

17:16.319 --> 17:17.680
Are you sure, sweetheart?

17:17.720 --> 17:19.920
Peppy was... Peppy's name.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.760
I want Peppy.

17:21.800 --> 17:25.120
Oh. She does know that...
that's not Peppy, though, so...

17:25.160 --> 17:26.560
Of course she does.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.079
But I think
if she wants to call him Peppy,

17:28.120 --> 17:29.160
it doesn't matter.

17:29.200 --> 17:32.360
Do you love Peppy, darling?
Peppy, come here. Peppy! Peppy!

17:32.400 --> 17:34.280
Oh, Peppy it is.

17:34.320 --> 17:37.920
Yay! Vroom! Vroom!
Ahh, no, don't do that.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.200
Can we not... Can we not do that?
Vroom! Vroom!

17:39.240 --> 17:41.960
Be gentle, Berlin.
Vroom! Vroom!

17:43.920 --> 17:45.840
Stop. How do you make...

17:45.880 --> 17:48.640
Can you be gentle, Berlin.
She's being gentle.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.240
He's my dog now.

17:51.280 --> 17:53.480
Peppy! Come on, Peppy!

18:01.080 --> 18:02.800
Thank you for not making
it a big goodbye.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.080
It's less traumatic for Peppy.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.760
Yep.
Yeah, of course. No, worries.

18:07.080 --> 18:08.120
Yeah.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.880
And just let us know
if you've got any questions,

18:09.920 --> 18:11.480
any issues, anything.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.280
Of course.
Day or night.

18:13.320 --> 18:15.440
Yeah.
I'm sure we'll be fine.

18:15.480 --> 18:16.480
Totally.

18:16.520 --> 18:17.520
Cool, cool.
Let's go.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.400
Yeah, and just send some photos
when you can.

18:19.440 --> 18:23.400
OK. Well, take care.
It was so lovely to meet you both.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.160
Bye-bye!
OK, bye.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.080
Was that the right thing to do?

18:34.280 --> 18:35.360
I think so.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.480
Will he be OK?

18:44.760 --> 18:45.840
I mean...

18:47.720 --> 18:49.960
Dogs are pragmatists, you know?
I mean...

18:52.080 --> 18:54.880
Yeah, he's special,
but he's gonna...

18:54.920 --> 18:58.320
He's gonna love
whoever feeds him, won't he?

18:58.360 --> 19:00.000
That was always the deal
between humans and dogs.

19:00.000 --> 19:00.560
That was always the deal
between humans and dogs.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.920
It's always been the deal, you know?

19:01.960 --> 19:05.480
We let them sit near the campfire
and we'd feed them scraps,

19:05.520 --> 19:06.640
and they'd protect us

19:06.680 --> 19:08.720
when the lions were nearby,
you know?

19:08.760 --> 19:11.240
So, it's...

19:11.280 --> 19:13.680
it's kind of transactional.

19:13.720 --> 19:17.000
Doesn't make it less real,
but it's fine.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.120
He'll be happy.

19:18.160 --> 19:19.920
Yeah, but we loved him.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.800
Yeah. Yeah.

19:21.840 --> 19:24.840
(PHONE RINGS)

19:26.880 --> 19:27.880
Hi, Mum.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.720
Ashley, where are you?

19:29.760 --> 19:31.920
I'm just with Gordon.
What's going on?

19:31.960 --> 19:33.920
Something's happened. I need you.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.360
What's happened?
Are you... Are you OK?

19:36.400 --> 19:39.600
No, I'm not. It's Lee.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.000
Please come here. I need you.

19:41.040 --> 19:43.040
OK, OK, OK, just breathe.
Breathe, Mum.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.040
OK, I'll be there soon.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.800
What's wrong?
Oh, fuck knows.

19:48.840 --> 19:51.800
It's like she knew that
I was having a moment.

19:51.840 --> 19:54.840
(SOFT MUSIC)

20:08.280 --> 20:09.360
OK.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.560
I'd better go see
what's up with Mum.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.920
Yeah.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.240
You OK?
Yeah.

20:25.520 --> 20:26.800
I guess I'll see you round?

20:26.840 --> 20:27.920
Yeah, definitely.

20:30.840 --> 20:32.240
Is that it?

20:32.280 --> 20:33.360
What?

20:35.600 --> 20:36.640
OK.

20:38.040 --> 20:40.520
Well, I...I...I have to go.
Bye, Gordon.

20:42.760 --> 20:44.080
Ciao for now.

20:51.480 --> 20:55.720
I said, "No, Lee, it's not spam."

20:55.760 --> 20:57.000
It's all over Facebook.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.160
Everyone can see

20:58.200 --> 21:00.000
how many Candy Crush games
you've played.

21:00.000 --> 21:00.920
how many Candy Crush games
you've played.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.600
He's played literally hundreds
of Candy Crush games

21:04.640 --> 21:07.080
with this 21-year-old Korean girl,

21:07.120 --> 21:09.680
but he kept saying it was spam.

21:09.720 --> 21:12.240
Oh, you're joking, Mum.

21:12.280 --> 21:14.200
But then I went through his phone,

21:14.240 --> 21:16.160
and she's all through
his chatsnap as well.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.680
And he's been sending her money,
my money.

21:18.720 --> 21:21.160
And it's been going on for months.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.920
Oh, my god. Mum, I'm so sorry.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.320
You were right about him, Ashley.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.760
You were.

21:29.800 --> 21:34.160
Well, you know,
I'm...I'm sorry that I was right.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.680
No, I'm sorry
that I didn't listen to you.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.840
I'm sorry that I believed him
and not you.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.480
You are my family.

21:40.520 --> 21:41.560
It's OK, Mum.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.080
No, it's not OK.
You're my only family.

21:45.760 --> 21:50.040
I love you so much, Ashley Maree.

21:50.080 --> 21:51.240
Oh, Mummy.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.640
(PHONE RINGS)
Oh.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.760
Oh, I've gotta take this.

21:59.800 --> 22:00.000
Just make yourself comfortable,
darling.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.240
Just make yourself comfortable,
darling.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.480
This could take a while.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.120
Well, what have you got to say
for yourself?

22:08.520 --> 22:10.600
Don't call me
if you're going to lie to me.

22:38.840 --> 22:41.840
(SOBS)

22:47.440 --> 22:52.320
Gordy, you left the window open.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.080
Ahh, fuck it.

23:12.840 --> 23:15.640
Are you crying about us
or are you crying about Colin?

23:16.680 --> 23:19.720
Ahh, oh, it's everything.

23:19.760 --> 23:23.720
If it were like a pie chart,

23:23.760 --> 23:24.800
what would it look like?

23:26.040 --> 23:27.120
Um...

23:29.960 --> 23:32.160
I don't know. It's a lot.

23:33.720 --> 23:34.800
It's just, um...

23:36.960 --> 23:39.040
this is a once in a year cry,
you know.

23:40.880 --> 23:43.280
What's the saddest thing though?

23:43.320 --> 23:44.920
Does it matter?

23:44.960 --> 23:45.960
Well, yeah,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.360
'cause I was just going
to have a little cry too and...

23:48.400 --> 23:49.680
Were you?
Yeah.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.520
I mean, it wasn't going to be like

23:51.560 --> 23:54.440
an Irish keening
like what you're doing,

23:54.480 --> 23:55.920
but you know,

23:55.960 --> 23:59.240
'cause I just have lots of
little cries throughout the year.

23:59.280 --> 24:00.000
What was yours about?

24:00.000 --> 24:00.360
What was yours about?

24:01.800 --> 24:02.880
Pie chart-wise.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.280
I asked you first.

24:08.360 --> 24:09.440
Um...

24:12.760 --> 24:14.800
I think I accidentally
opened my heart

24:14.840 --> 24:16.600
to a crippled dog...

24:18.440 --> 24:21.120
And then you slipped through
the opening at the same time.

24:25.960 --> 24:28.080
If this is falling in love,
I really don't like it.

24:28.120 --> 24:31.320
I'm not a fan
'cause it's exhausting.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.600
I feel a bit like I'm going insane.

24:39.960 --> 24:42.200
Do you?
Yeah.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.120
That's nice.
Is it?

24:48.960 --> 24:50.040
So, what do we do?

24:51.960 --> 24:54.960
(SOFT MUSIC)

25:04.840 --> 25:06.720
I think we go get our dog back.

25:06.760 --> 25:08.480
Oh, thank god.

25:08.520 --> 25:09.560
Let's do it.

25:12.480 --> 25:15.680
I hated that fucking family.
Oh, they were fucked.

25:16.960 --> 25:19.240
Who calls their kid Berlin?
Wankers.

25:21.960 --> 25:23.680
How are we gonna get him back?
Oh, I don't know.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.400
We'll...we'll figure it out
on the way.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.920
We are gonna make
that little girl cry though.

25:30.200 --> 25:34.280
Good.

25:41.160 --> 25:44.400
# I ain't got time
To roll the beast down

25:44.440 --> 25:47.800
# But if I don't then
How I'm gon' eat?

25:47.840 --> 25:51.160
# I'm doing just fine
With all of this pride

25:51.200 --> 25:54.560
# I'm lucky I got somewhere to sleep

25:54.600 --> 25:57.960
# I'm living on the word
Of other peoples' promises

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
# That I don't think
They even gon' keep

26:00.040 --> 26:01.120
# They not gon' keep

26:01.160 --> 26:04.480
# But they said I could "move in"
And "don't worry about the rent"

26:04.520 --> 26:07.800
# But they really want me out
On the streets

26:07.840 --> 26:09.600
# If they show you who they are

26:09.640 --> 26:11.440
# You better believe them now

26:11.480 --> 26:14.680
# 'Cause if you don't
You're gonna have problems

26:14.720 --> 26:16.400
# You wanna worry around

26:16.440 --> 26:18.200
# And put yourself in the ground

26:18.240 --> 26:20.640
# 'Cause that's what happens
When you allow them... #

26:20.680 --> 26:21.680
(CHORUS)

26:21.720 --> 26:24.040
# But it ain't that type of party

26:24.080 --> 26:25.080
# Oh, no

26:25.120 --> 26:27.080
# Imma' make it baby,
You're gonna see

26:27.120 --> 26:28.120
# Gonna see

26:28.160 --> 26:29.360
# 'Cause it ain't that. #

26:29.400 --> 26:32.400
