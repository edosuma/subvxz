WEBVTT

00:10.400 --> 00:11.740
Using stratosphere rockets

00:11.820 --> 00:14.110
dropped on us
from 60 to 70 miles up,

00:14.200 --> 00:15.950
Germany is engaged
in another form

00:16.030 --> 00:17.490
of terror raiding.

00:17.580 --> 00:19.540
To flying bombs is added V2,

00:19.620 --> 00:21.020
another wholly
indiscriminate weapon

00:21.080 --> 00:23.250
used as a morale booster

00:23.330 --> 00:25.120
for the German people.

00:25.210 --> 00:28.090
It's the truly typical effort of
the mortally-injured Nazi beast

00:28.170 --> 00:30.630
to attempt to tear down
everything as he goes under.

01:01.240 --> 01:04.620
<i>What would you say was
Mr. Donovan's state of mind</i>

01:04.709 --> 01:06.710
<i>on the night in question?</i>

01:07.920 --> 01:09.630
I mean, the guy
had a screw loose.

01:09.710 --> 01:11.340
Wasn't anyone's

01:11.420 --> 01:13.460
<i>fault but his own.</i>

01:20.390 --> 01:23.520
<i>Where were you at
the time of the explosion?</i>

01:23.600 --> 01:26.190
<i>The one you really
should be talking to is Jack.</i>

01:26.270 --> 01:28.020
He's the last one
to see him alive.

01:29.770 --> 01:31.690
<i>In your opinion,</i>

01:31.770 --> 01:33.690
<i>why did Mr. Donovan
commit suicide?</i>

01:33.780 --> 01:36.490
<i>This wasn't a suicide.</i>

01:36.570 --> 01:38.030
Frater E.D. ascended.

01:38.110 --> 01:41.450
His body of light has become one
with the universe.

01:45.040 --> 01:47.620
<i>What are you talking about...
ascended?</i>

01:49.540 --> 01:52.380
<i>Ascension is what
we are all striving for...</i>

01:52.460 --> 01:55.710
<i>to come ever closer
to the divine.</i>

01:55.800 --> 01:57.220
But this was not ascension.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.220
This was the demise
of a broken man

01:59.300 --> 02:02.680
led down the wrong path.

02:05.640 --> 02:09.229
<i>There's a lot of conflicting
reports about what happened,</i>

02:09.310 --> 02:11.560
<i>but a lot of them implicate you.</i>

02:11.650 --> 02:13.230
<i>Ernest wanted to die.</i>

02:13.320 --> 02:15.530
<i>I was the only one
that tried to stop him.</i>

02:15.610 --> 02:17.240
<i>What about your Magus?</i>

02:17.320 --> 02:20.610
He was...
he was too preoccupied.

02:20.700 --> 02:23.080
With what?

02:24.660 --> 02:27.750
Let's just say,
the Magus prioritizes the needs

02:27.830 --> 02:29.750
of some people over others.

02:29.830 --> 02:33.380
And unfortunately, Ernest
slipped through the cracks.

02:37.510 --> 02:39.430
<i>This is Orange Grove's darkest hour.</i>

02:39.510 --> 02:42.600
This cult has turned Arthur
Fleming's magnificent estate

02:42.680 --> 02:45.260
into a stomping ground
for perverts,

02:45.350 --> 02:46.810
homosexuals and Negroes.

02:46.890 --> 02:48.600
I had my life threatened.

02:48.680 --> 02:51.100
Attacked because I dared speak
against them,

02:51.190 --> 02:52.900
but their blood lust
won't be sated.

02:52.980 --> 02:55.440
What happened here
was no accident.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.110
It was a human sacrifice.

03:00.700 --> 03:02.990
You do realize why
I have a hard time

03:03.070 --> 03:06.330
taking any of your
claims seriously?

03:06.410 --> 03:08.950
Your stepfather's been
a prominent member

03:09.040 --> 03:10.620
of this community for decades.

03:10.710 --> 03:12.710
Got the church behind him.

03:12.790 --> 03:15.920
You have a fringe
religion that uses sex

03:16.000 --> 03:18.630
and the promise of great powers
to manipulate its members.

03:18.710 --> 03:20.420
Your own husband

03:20.510 --> 03:22.970
has said the leader of your cult

03:23.050 --> 03:25.140
<i>has been abusing that power.</i>

03:27.260 --> 03:30.430
The only abuse of power
I see is the one

03:30.520 --> 03:32.810
that's happening
right in front of me.

03:36.900 --> 03:38.820
Coroner's report came in.

03:38.900 --> 03:41.740
Bones we found in the rubble
are from a goat.

03:42.740 --> 03:44.950
We don't have a body?

03:45.030 --> 03:47.830
Donovan used over 200 gallons
of Class-A explosives.

03:47.910 --> 03:49.200
Anything within 15 feet

03:49.290 --> 03:51.330
of the blast would
have been incinerated.

03:51.410 --> 03:54.380
Doesn't matter. We don't have
a body, we don't have a case.

03:54.460 --> 03:55.830
Hey, Detective?

03:55.920 --> 03:57.630
You got to listen to this.

03:57.710 --> 04:00.170
What do you got?
The recordings we found?

04:03.220 --> 04:06.680
Looking for help,
and they were just 14, 15.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.350
They weren't ready to be
mothers.

04:08.430 --> 04:09.890
Jesus.

04:09.970 --> 04:11.890
So you gave them freedom.

04:11.980 --> 04:13.850
You honored their will?

04:13.940 --> 04:15.850
Yes.

04:15.940 --> 04:18.980
All right, listen
to the rest of these. Now.

04:19.070 --> 04:21.029
<i>Let him greet the sun at dawn,</i>

04:21.110 --> 04:22.990
giving the sign of his grade.

04:23.070 --> 04:25.070
And let him say in a loud voice:

04:25.160 --> 04:29.660
Hail unto Thee who art Ra
in Thy rising, even unto Thee

04:29.740 --> 04:32.000
who art Ra in Thy strength.

04:32.080 --> 04:35.370
<i>I could feel his thighs</i>

04:35.460 --> 04:37.920
<i>tremor in my hands as he came.</i>

04:38.000 --> 04:40.250
<i>Was the best
dice game in Vernon.</i>

04:40.340 --> 04:43.220
<i>Any time she ask,
I just tell Betty</i>

04:43.300 --> 04:45.220
<i>I was out
trying to drum up gigs.</i>

04:45.300 --> 04:47.680
<i>Angie's husband
would get violent on her,</i>

04:47.760 --> 04:50.010
<i>so, when he came looking
for her, I paid some guys</i>

04:50.100 --> 04:51.890
<i>from the shop
to show him how it feels.</i>

04:51.970 --> 04:54.180
<i>There. Doesn't it feel better</i>

04:54.270 --> 04:56.020
<i>to unburden yourself?</i>

05:03.610 --> 05:05.400
Mr. Parsons,

05:05.490 --> 05:07.610
you can go.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.410
It's about goddamn time.

05:09.490 --> 05:12.160
- Not all of you.
- Hold on. You're under arrest.

05:12.240 --> 05:14.306
- Six of you are under arrest.
- Hands behind your back.

05:14.330 --> 05:15.636
- We're taking you in for bookmaking.
- Well, what are...?

05:15.660 --> 05:17.540
What are you doing?
These people had nothing

05:17.620 --> 05:19.590
to do with
Frater E.D.'s actions.

05:19.670 --> 05:21.436
They're all on record
admitting to other crimes.

05:21.460 --> 05:22.550
What do you mean?

05:22.630 --> 05:24.260
They told him,

05:24.340 --> 05:26.050
and he recorded it.

05:26.130 --> 05:27.590
The fuck is he talking about?

05:27.680 --> 05:29.970
All right, let's go.

05:30.050 --> 05:31.310
Get up.

05:31.390 --> 05:32.560
What is he talking about?

05:32.640 --> 05:34.560
I don't understand.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.921
We'll get a lawyer first thing.
We'll get you out of here!

05:38.350 --> 05:39.610
Come on.

06:59.940 --> 07:03.020
For as much as thou hast made

07:03.110 --> 07:05.440
the Law of Freedom thine,

07:05.520 --> 07:07.400
thou hast lived

07:07.480 --> 07:11.820
in light and liberty and love.

07:18.120 --> 07:21.500
I still don't understand
why he did it.

07:21.580 --> 07:23.500
Ask him.

07:23.580 --> 07:26.170
He's more likely to
tell you the truth.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.460
You're still angry.

07:30.420 --> 07:33.300
What did you mean when you said
they weren't just workings?

07:37.100 --> 07:39.220
Are you in love with him?

07:41.980 --> 07:44.190
I'm not.

08:22.730 --> 08:24.390
All right, now, back it up.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.650
You should go to hell!

08:29.360 --> 08:30.480
Get out of Pasadena!

08:30.570 --> 08:32.490
Sinner!

08:41.870 --> 08:43.039
The cult permits

08:43.120 --> 08:44.039
lewd conduct...

08:44.120 --> 08:46.000
Shh, he's coming.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.670
This is ridiculous.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.630
Everybody listen up!

08:54.720 --> 08:58.640
You can't always believe what
you read in the papers, okay?

08:58.720 --> 09:02.310
There was no human sacrifice.

09:02.390 --> 09:05.640
There was a lot of booze and
some fun that got out of hand,

09:05.730 --> 09:07.730
but that is it.

09:08.860 --> 09:11.650
Now, everybody get back to work.

09:11.730 --> 09:14.150
Everything is fine.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.660
You heard him.
Get back to work.

09:16.740 --> 09:19.200
I'm sorry, Mr. Parsons,

09:19.280 --> 09:21.160
but you're no longer authorized.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.330
What are you talking about?
My lab is back there.

09:23.410 --> 09:24.870
I'm just the messenger, sir,

09:24.960 --> 09:27.500
but your security
clearance has been revoked.

09:27.580 --> 09:29.630
Who issued that order?

09:33.460 --> 09:36.010
I know you're in there,
you son of a bitch!

09:36.090 --> 09:38.010
Come out and tell me yourself!

09:38.090 --> 09:40.180
Fuck.

09:40.260 --> 09:41.850
Sounds like Jack's here.

09:41.930 --> 09:43.680
He didn't leave me much choice.

09:43.770 --> 09:46.690
Mr. Parsons either knew
he had a Nazi living in his home

09:46.770 --> 09:49.270
and failed to report it,
or he didn't know,

09:49.350 --> 09:51.360
which shows an utter lack
of judgment.

09:51.440 --> 09:53.400
Either way,
Mr. Parsons has proven himself

09:53.480 --> 09:55.070
to be a major security risk.

09:55.150 --> 09:57.030
Surely, Professor, Jack...

09:57.110 --> 10:00.030
Richard, friendship is
an admirable quality,

10:00.120 --> 10:03.700
but our responsibilities
are more than one man.

10:03.790 --> 10:05.080
Professor's right, son.

10:05.160 --> 10:07.250
And with Mr. Parsons
off the project,

10:07.330 --> 10:10.210
the main obstacle
to funding JPL has been removed.

10:10.290 --> 10:11.750
So, now,

10:11.840 --> 10:13.550
back to business.

10:13.630 --> 10:15.880
Go ahead and crack open
those folders.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.050
As I'm sure you know by now,

10:18.130 --> 10:19.840
the Krauts have started
pounding London

10:19.930 --> 10:22.510
with their V2s, but there is

10:22.600 --> 10:25.850
the smallest sliver
of a silver lining.

10:25.930 --> 10:27.890
One of the V2s

10:27.980 --> 10:31.270
that landed in Dulwich
failed to detonate.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.230
We have an intact V2?

10:34.320 --> 10:36.740
Not we.

10:36.820 --> 10:38.400
Our allies in Britain.

10:38.490 --> 10:40.910
Yes, our colleagues there
have invited us

10:40.990 --> 10:43.080
to examine it in person.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.910
Of course, a mission like this

10:44.990 --> 10:47.540
requires the utmost secrecy,

10:47.620 --> 10:50.790
so that means that no one...

10:50.870 --> 10:52.830
and I do mean no one...

10:52.920 --> 10:55.840
outside this room
can know about it.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.730
- Jack...
- Who does Wallace think he is,

11:11.810 --> 11:14.480
keeping me out of
the project I created?

11:14.560 --> 11:16.530
Jack, that party was a disaster.

11:17.980 --> 11:21.030
Hey, if any of what Wallace said
is true, then...

11:21.110 --> 11:23.160
What?

11:23.240 --> 11:25.780
Then you are a security risk.

11:27.870 --> 11:29.846
I trust you haven't divulged
any information you shouldn't.

11:29.870 --> 11:31.790
You had no fucking right.
I did nothing wrong.

11:31.870 --> 11:34.460
You withheld information, and
you lied to a federal officer.

11:34.540 --> 11:36.686
- Withheld what information?
- About the people in your house.

11:36.710 --> 11:38.130
I didn't know she was a...

11:38.210 --> 11:39.630
She was a Nazi. I know.

11:39.710 --> 11:41.630
But what you don't know
can kill you, Jack.

11:41.720 --> 11:44.760
- Brigitte fled Germany.
- That's right,

11:44.850 --> 11:46.810
and she happened
to ensconce herself in the home

11:46.890 --> 11:49.270
of a prominent
military scientist.

11:49.350 --> 11:52.600
And now, maybe,
maybe that's a coincidence,

11:52.690 --> 11:55.810
but when it comes
to threats of national security,

11:55.900 --> 11:57.940
there can be no margin
for error, and the same goes

11:58.020 --> 11:59.706
for your relationship
with Aleister Crowley.

11:59.730 --> 12:02.280
For the last time, I do not have

12:02.360 --> 12:03.716
a relationship
with Aleister Crowley.

12:03.740 --> 12:05.320
The more you deny it,

12:05.410 --> 12:07.346
- the deeper you dig yourself in.
- If you've been lying

12:07.370 --> 12:08.660
to Agent Wallace,

12:08.740 --> 12:11.580
do yourself a favor,
and come clean.

12:12.580 --> 12:14.290
Please.

12:14.370 --> 12:17.380
It's good advice,
Mr. Parsons.

12:18.880 --> 12:21.510
I've never met Aleister Crowley.

12:21.590 --> 12:25.180
And he has never instructed me
to act against the interests

12:25.260 --> 12:27.180
of my government.

12:27.260 --> 12:29.810
Okay.

12:29.890 --> 12:31.890
I believe you.

12:33.940 --> 12:35.730
We'll clear this up
when I get back.

12:35.810 --> 12:37.310
Get back from where?

12:40.940 --> 12:42.990
Richard.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.880
The party at your
mansion was eye-opening.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.720
For all its peculiarities,

13:06.800 --> 13:10.060
your religion seems to value
something that I also

13:10.140 --> 13:12.390
hold very dear:

13:12.470 --> 13:14.060
truth.

13:14.140 --> 13:15.890
You know, it can't be easy,

13:15.980 --> 13:18.560
living so far away
from your ideals.

13:24.780 --> 13:27.700
Maybe it's time
we cut out the middleman

13:27.780 --> 13:30.030
and I talk
to the Great Beast himself.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.250
Jack, if you want
to be reinstated

13:35.330 --> 13:36.710
into the missile project,

13:36.790 --> 13:41.130
then this is the only card
you have left to play.

14:04.150 --> 14:05.740
Little hard to know
what to pack,

14:05.820 --> 14:07.740
since you can't tell me
where you're going.

14:07.820 --> 14:10.740
I'm sorry, but the
military's being very strict,

14:10.820 --> 14:12.450
especially after that party.

14:12.530 --> 14:14.910
Can't say I'm surprised.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.420
Still, it doesn't sit right,

14:18.500 --> 14:20.790
Jack being cut out like this.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.670
I know he's your friend, but...

14:23.750 --> 14:25.630
maybe it's for the best?

14:27.090 --> 14:29.470
You can finally run things
the way you want.

14:29.550 --> 14:31.300
- No more curveballs.
- Those curveballs

14:31.390 --> 14:33.680
have led to some
of our biggest breakthroughs.

14:37.730 --> 14:39.640
Can I ask you something?

14:39.730 --> 14:41.980
This Aleister Crowley,

14:42.060 --> 14:44.860
is he really as bad
as people say?

14:44.940 --> 14:47.110
Why do you ask?

14:47.190 --> 14:48.780
Well, not because of you.

14:48.860 --> 14:50.460
I probably shouldn't be telling
you this,

14:50.530 --> 14:54.160
but he is a big reason
why Jack is in so much trouble.

14:54.240 --> 14:55.790
Some people even think

14:55.870 --> 14:59.040
that Crowley's working
with the enemy.

14:59.120 --> 15:01.040
Well, I don't know anything
about that.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.840
But... he's not someone
you want to cross,

15:03.920 --> 15:05.460
that's for sure.

15:05.550 --> 15:07.420
What do you mean?

15:09.760 --> 15:12.180
It's very important that I know.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.810
When I left Thelema,

15:17.890 --> 15:19.020
I thought,
"No big deal."

15:19.100 --> 15:20.890
Do what thou wilt, right?

15:26.480 --> 15:29.190
Then this showed up
in my mailbox.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.240
I was a measly second degree.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.910
But Crowley took time
to threaten me.

15:33.990 --> 15:36.580
He said if I
ever exposed Thelema

15:36.660 --> 15:38.540
or spoke out against it,

15:38.620 --> 15:40.370
he'd expose all my secrets.

15:40.460 --> 15:41.870
Jesus.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.250
What secrets was
he referring to?

15:44.330 --> 15:45.710
Don't worry.

15:45.790 --> 15:48.000
You know everything
there is to know.

15:48.090 --> 15:50.340
Now <i>you're</i> the one
keeping secrets.

15:50.420 --> 15:53.840
I wish I could tell you, but
if I lost my clearance, too...

15:53.930 --> 15:54.720
Can you at least tell me

15:54.800 --> 15:56.640
if they're sending you
anywhere dangerous?

16:00.520 --> 16:01.890
Richie?

16:01.980 --> 16:04.400
It's just a research trip.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.730
What if something
happens to you?

16:06.820 --> 16:08.860
How will I know
where to find you?

16:08.940 --> 16:10.900
Nothing is going to happen.

16:10.990 --> 16:14.860
I'll be thinking about you
the entire time.

16:17.830 --> 16:20.580
Guess that'll have to do.

16:25.330 --> 16:26.840
Shoes.

16:44.690 --> 16:47.810
Walter Bennett, please rise.

16:52.190 --> 16:54.610
You are charged
with illegal gambling,

16:54.700 --> 16:56.110
public perversion, and...

16:56.200 --> 16:57.950
miscegenation.

16:58.030 --> 16:59.660
How do you plead?

16:59.740 --> 17:01.080
Not guilty.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.580
Your Honor,
given awareness of this case

17:03.660 --> 17:05.619
and the clear menace
the defendants

17:05.710 --> 17:06.960
pose to society,

17:07.040 --> 17:09.500
any leniency with respect

17:09.589 --> 17:12.089
to bail could itself be
a threat to public morality.

17:12.170 --> 17:13.630
Your Honor, it is our contention

17:13.720 --> 17:15.130
that Mr. Bennett's case,

17:15.220 --> 17:16.470
along with his codefendants,

17:16.550 --> 17:18.339
is concerned fundamentally

17:18.430 --> 17:20.349
with the free practice
of religion.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.180
They are not menaces to society,

17:22.270 --> 17:24.180
nor do they pose
any flight risk.

17:24.270 --> 17:26.980
The First Amendment does
not cover criminal activity,

17:27.060 --> 17:30.320
and there are several
serious offenses here.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.650
Bail for Mr. Bennett
will be set at $30,000.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.660
This is all your fault!

17:43.750 --> 17:46.120
Ms. Joan Rossi,

17:46.210 --> 17:49.000
please rise.

17:50.380 --> 17:53.300
You're being charged with
performing illegal abortions

17:53.380 --> 17:55.970
in your occupation as a nurse.

17:56.050 --> 17:57.840
How do you plead?

18:04.600 --> 18:07.230
$250,000?

18:07.310 --> 18:09.560
Rockefeller himself
couldn't bail 'em out.

18:09.650 --> 18:11.190
Hey, head high, tails up.

18:11.270 --> 18:13.860
We'll be in touch
when we have a trial date.

18:13.940 --> 18:16.240
- Even if we sold the house...
- We're not at that yet.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.400
Well, we got to do something.
Did you see Walt?

18:18.490 --> 18:19.820
Someone's been beating on him.

18:19.910 --> 18:21.280
Perhaps there's some other way.

18:21.370 --> 18:23.030
- Like what, Magick?
- You're the reason

18:23.120 --> 18:24.870
- we're in this situation.
- Well, at least

18:24.950 --> 18:28.540
I have never led a man down the
path to his own destruction.

18:28.620 --> 18:30.210
This is not the time.

18:30.290 --> 18:33.550
Patty.

18:33.630 --> 18:35.470
Justice should be swift
after what they've done

18:35.550 --> 18:37.590
to Virgil and our family.

18:37.670 --> 18:39.010
Jail is not punishment enough.

18:39.090 --> 18:40.720
It'll have to do.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.930
I'd like to put the
whole matter to bed.

18:46.850 --> 18:49.390
Patty, dear.

18:49.480 --> 18:53.150
The D.A. was just telling us
this will all be over soon.

18:53.230 --> 18:54.400
Then we can help you...

18:54.480 --> 18:56.230
I want you
to understand something.

18:56.320 --> 18:59.070
I have a new home now,
a new family.

18:59.150 --> 19:01.450
A family of fornicators
and murderers.

19:01.530 --> 19:04.080
If we're capable
of one human sacrifice,

19:04.160 --> 19:06.040
what's one more?

19:29.480 --> 19:31.230
Is that for the V-2s?

19:31.310 --> 19:33.230
Yes, sir.
Whole city's on high alert.

19:33.310 --> 19:35.230
But the skies seem quiet
tonight.

19:35.320 --> 19:38.230
They move faster than the speed
of sound, don't they?

19:38.320 --> 19:40.450
It's the ones
you don't hear that get you.

19:40.530 --> 19:42.820
Filip.

19:42.910 --> 19:45.120
Oh.

19:45.200 --> 19:48.450
It's good to see you,
my old friend.

19:48.540 --> 19:51.620
- I wish it were under better circumstances.
- Yes.

19:51.710 --> 19:54.250
Gentlemen, please follow me.

19:58.210 --> 20:01.340
It's, uh, right this way.

20:01.420 --> 20:03.130
Even on our heels,

20:03.220 --> 20:05.300
Hitler keeps us on our toes.

20:05.390 --> 20:06.640
Fortunately,

20:06.720 --> 20:11.430
not all of his vengeance
weapons explode.

20:21.900 --> 20:23.110
No.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.820
No one's going to prison.

20:28.580 --> 20:31.410
Well, I guess we'll have to
just get a new lawyer then.

20:34.710 --> 20:36.330
What's happening now?

20:36.420 --> 20:38.710
He wants them all to cut
deals with the prosecutor.

20:38.800 --> 20:39.710
The police have found witnesses

20:39.800 --> 20:43.050
to corroborate the recordings.

20:45.430 --> 20:47.970
You have to believe...

20:48.050 --> 20:49.810
I never meant to hurt anyone.

20:49.890 --> 20:51.060
Why would I believe you?

20:51.140 --> 20:52.890
You won't even tell me

20:52.980 --> 20:55.020
why you made them
in the first place.

20:55.100 --> 20:57.020
Everything I did,

20:57.110 --> 21:00.020
everything we did was because
I thought I could trust you.

21:00.110 --> 21:02.320
You can.

21:03.650 --> 21:05.490
All I had to do
was let you go to Mexico.

21:05.570 --> 21:07.200
Then none of this
would have happened.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.330
No, please.

21:13.410 --> 21:16.250
Tell me you don't regret it all.

21:24.090 --> 21:26.590
We can make this right.

21:38.980 --> 21:41.270
<i>A beating heart.</i>

21:41.360 --> 21:45.530
An engine capable
of producing 25 tons of thrust.

21:45.610 --> 21:48.070
The injection nozzles
adjust the fuel

21:48.160 --> 21:51.240
and oxidizing ratios
as the combustion is happening.

21:51.330 --> 21:53.540
Your fuel technician
will have a right bloody time

21:53.620 --> 21:55.080
sorting out how it works.

21:55.160 --> 21:57.540
Fortunately, I hear your man...

21:57.620 --> 21:59.250
Parsons, isn't it?

21:59.330 --> 22:01.960
Is a bit of a savant.

22:03.500 --> 22:04.880
Well,

22:04.960 --> 22:07.720
I'll leave you all to it.

22:12.680 --> 22:13.930
I know what you're thinking.

22:14.020 --> 22:14.930
He should be here.

22:15.020 --> 22:15.930
He only has himself to blame.

22:16.020 --> 22:17.700
He's the only one who
understands chemistry

22:17.730 --> 22:19.650
this complex.

22:19.730 --> 22:21.980
We're hurting ourselves
by not having him here.

22:22.070 --> 22:25.440
I know I have defended
Mr. Parsons in the past.

22:25.530 --> 22:29.240
But there is a world
with great thinkers

22:29.320 --> 22:32.740
who will emerge
once this war's over.

22:32.830 --> 22:37.290
And none come
with Mr. Parsons' liabilities.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.210
Are you planning
on staying late?

22:43.290 --> 22:44.170
Sarah offered me

22:44.250 --> 22:45.800
a ride.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.970
There's still
a lot of work to do.

22:48.050 --> 22:49.970
Anything I can help with?

22:50.050 --> 22:51.970
Got all the help I need
right here.

22:52.050 --> 22:54.470
Thanks.

22:54.560 --> 22:57.140
If you're gonna have
a pity party,

22:57.230 --> 22:59.690
at least put on better music.

23:02.560 --> 23:04.320
There you go.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.650
When I put on the radio,
I like to escape,

23:06.730 --> 23:09.320
not be reminded
that everything is so dreary.

23:09.400 --> 23:12.320
It'd take a lot more than music
to make me forget.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.670
To a brighter tomorrow.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.140
Can I ask you a question?

23:32.220 --> 23:35.350
If you had to choose
between the Agape

23:35.430 --> 23:38.520
and the thing
you've always wanted,

23:38.600 --> 23:40.770
which would you choose?

23:40.850 --> 23:42.190
That's easy.

23:42.270 --> 23:43.860
They're one and the same to me.

23:49.490 --> 23:51.700
I think your ride's
probably waiting.

23:53.950 --> 23:57.700
You know, I really don't like
this new look on you.

23:57.790 --> 23:59.540
What look?

23:59.620 --> 24:02.540
Failure.

24:04.630 --> 24:09.210
Figure out what you need
to do to win and do it.

25:25.870 --> 25:28.580
Why did you want to meet here?

25:28.670 --> 25:31.960
You're calling a number
that's been compromised.

25:32.050 --> 25:35.470
Obviously, they know
we are meeting.

25:35.550 --> 25:36.970
How? I never told anyone.

25:37.050 --> 25:39.350
Well, maybe
your phone is tapped.

25:39.430 --> 25:41.680
Agent Wallace seems to be
watching your every move.

25:41.760 --> 25:43.310
I need you to talk to him.

25:43.390 --> 25:44.850
Not a chance in hell.

25:44.930 --> 25:46.640
Well, he's convinced
you're a traitor.

25:46.730 --> 25:49.310
He can think I'm
King George for all I care.

25:49.400 --> 25:51.320
I don't answer to him.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.650
Well, I do.

25:52.730 --> 25:53.836
And this is
the only way I'm gonna get

25:53.860 --> 25:55.150
my fucking clearance back.

25:55.240 --> 25:56.610
If I lose my position,

25:56.700 --> 25:58.380
everything I've been
working for goes away.

25:58.450 --> 26:00.870
Oh, Frater J.P., why
would you fear that?

26:00.950 --> 26:04.790
Your work is far too essential

26:04.870 --> 26:06.330
to the Great Work

26:06.410 --> 26:08.040
to just be forgotten.

26:08.120 --> 26:11.710
What is this fucking
"Great Work"? Hmm?

26:11.790 --> 26:13.630
Open your eyes.

26:13.710 --> 26:16.550
This World War is
a blood sacrifice

26:16.630 --> 26:18.680
on a global level.

26:18.760 --> 26:22.640
And weapons that wield
the power of the gods

26:22.720 --> 26:24.720
will help man to realize

26:24.810 --> 26:27.560
that he needs no god.

26:27.640 --> 26:30.900
And you hold the key
to making those weapons.

26:30.980 --> 26:35.740
If your government cannot
appreciate your talents,

26:35.820 --> 26:37.570
well, there are others who will,

26:37.650 --> 26:42.240
and they will pay mightily
for your services.

26:45.830 --> 26:47.870
You're talking about treason.

26:47.960 --> 26:50.290
There is no such thing
as treason

26:50.370 --> 26:54.710
when your only allegiance
is to mankind himself.

26:56.630 --> 27:01.340
You meet me here tonight...

27:01.430 --> 27:03.970
and get ready to
face your destiny.

27:09.310 --> 27:13.270
The man of will
breaks all boundaries.

27:26.990 --> 27:28.410
You sure about this?

27:28.500 --> 27:30.290
Sister Joan showed me how.

27:30.370 --> 27:32.080
Even did it for me once.

27:32.170 --> 27:34.090
Few years back
when Walter and I...

27:35.630 --> 27:38.550
But the test was negative.

27:38.630 --> 27:40.420
You'll have another chance
once he's out.

27:40.510 --> 27:44.140
People who like us don't usually
get out once we in.

27:44.220 --> 27:46.600
Uh, but we gotta
stay focused on our...

27:46.680 --> 27:47.930
on our intention.

27:48.020 --> 27:49.680
Can you hold it?

28:00.740 --> 28:02.820
Let the truth be known.

28:07.700 --> 28:09.160
There.

28:09.250 --> 28:11.120
Should manifest
an answer in a day or two.

28:11.210 --> 28:13.830
If the frog lays eggs,

28:13.920 --> 28:15.790
you'll know you're with child.

28:16.250 --> 28:18.050
We need you to be strong now.

28:18.130 --> 28:20.460
You're the reason we all here.

28:20.550 --> 28:22.590
You gave us a paradise.

28:22.680 --> 28:25.510
Before it all
came crashing down.

28:25.590 --> 28:29.180
True, but just like
Thelema teaches us,

28:29.270 --> 28:32.270
from destruction comes rebirth.

28:39.570 --> 28:42.320
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

28:45.070 --> 28:47.950
Morning.

28:52.040 --> 28:54.500
Have you even slept,
Dr. Onsted?

28:54.580 --> 28:59.210
If the V2s don't get you,
the time difference will.

28:59.300 --> 29:01.460
Actually, Professor...

29:03.380 --> 29:05.510
that's not what
was keeping me up.

29:05.590 --> 29:08.300
There's something I need
to deal with today...

29:08.390 --> 29:10.310
in the city.

29:10.390 --> 29:12.270
Could transport be arranged?

29:14.270 --> 29:15.850
Of course.

29:19.320 --> 29:20.916
You're making the right
choice, Mr. Parsons.

29:20.940 --> 29:23.570
I'm making the necessary choice.

29:23.650 --> 29:25.200
Okay.

29:25.280 --> 29:27.030
Where exactly did
he say to meet?

29:29.660 --> 29:31.740
I want to hear you say it again.

29:34.290 --> 29:37.710
When Crowley is in custody,
you will be reinstated.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.760
Outside the
Soviet Travel Bureau.

29:51.640 --> 29:54.520
I thought you said you just
wanted to talk to him.

29:56.140 --> 29:58.060
I do.

29:58.150 --> 30:00.770
But a man like Crowley
might take some convincing.

30:25.630 --> 30:27.380
This is it, Dr. Onsted.

31:40.210 --> 31:41.830
- Shit.
- The elevator!

31:41.920 --> 31:42.960
There he is!

31:46.250 --> 31:47.670
Go, take the stairs. Go!

31:47.760 --> 31:49.670
- Shit.
- Go! Go!

32:12.240 --> 32:14.160
Out of the way.

32:14.240 --> 32:15.870
Move.

32:15.950 --> 32:18.490
He's over there.
Keep moving, keep moving.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.460
Hello.

32:22.870 --> 32:25.040
Wait.

32:25.130 --> 32:27.290
I'm looking for the
man who wrote this.

32:31.260 --> 32:33.720
I'm a friend of Jack Parsons.

32:33.800 --> 32:36.260
He's in the elevator.

32:36.350 --> 32:38.640
He's over there!

32:54.320 --> 32:56.070
Wallace!

32:56.160 --> 32:57.740
Everybody, stay back!

32:57.830 --> 32:58.830
Don't shoot him!

32:58.870 --> 33:00.410
Hands behind your...

33:00.490 --> 33:03.250
What is wrong with you?
What's going on?

33:03.330 --> 33:06.290
It's not him.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.260
It's not him.

33:18.720 --> 33:21.640
Are you Aleister Crowley?

33:21.720 --> 33:24.560
Yes.

33:24.640 --> 33:27.150
How can I help you?

33:27.230 --> 33:30.230
There's a lot of people looking
for you.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.790
You don't happen
to be a Canadian, do you?

33:45.870 --> 33:47.960
Excuse me?

33:48.040 --> 33:53.420
Canadian soldiers
have the best tri.

33:53.510 --> 33:58.340
And I am... running low.

34:14.690 --> 34:16.449
Mm.

34:16.530 --> 34:18.530
Can I interest you
in one of these?

34:18.610 --> 34:19.989
It only costs...

34:20.070 --> 34:21.449
a shilling each.

34:21.530 --> 34:23.790
No. Sorry.

34:23.870 --> 34:27.000
I'm a friend of Jack Parsons.

34:28.290 --> 34:30.460
My name is Richard Onsted.

34:34.300 --> 34:35.840
Sir?

34:39.929 --> 34:41.679
Who the fuck are you?

34:41.760 --> 34:45.850
I just said, I'm Richard Onsted.

34:45.929 --> 34:48.980
I'm a friend of Jack Parsons.

34:49.060 --> 34:50.850
You do know who he is?

34:50.940 --> 34:53.190
Yes, yes. Frater J.P., yes.

34:54.940 --> 34:57.690
Fucking cunt!

34:57.780 --> 34:59.360
Did he send you here?

34:59.450 --> 35:02.530
What? No.

35:02.620 --> 35:04.540
My name is Richard Onsted.

35:04.620 --> 35:06.870
Richard Onsted. I heard you
the first two times.

35:06.950 --> 35:10.420
You and
Frater J.P. used to

35:10.500 --> 35:14.340
ride your bicycles down
to Devil's Gate Dam

35:14.420 --> 35:18.300
and set off your rockets
when you were boys.

35:18.380 --> 35:21.510
Saw your first
naked girl there, too,

35:21.590 --> 35:24.600
skinny dipping in the reservoir.

35:26.010 --> 35:27.270
How do you know that?

35:27.350 --> 35:30.560
Magick, you twat.

35:30.640 --> 35:33.650
I am a master.

35:33.730 --> 35:35.730
Master-bator.

35:35.820 --> 35:37.570
That's what
you're probably thinking.

35:37.650 --> 35:41.570
But I'm also
a master fucking magician.

35:41.660 --> 35:44.740
Since you know so much,

35:44.830 --> 35:47.410
are you also aware that you've
created quite an impediment

35:47.490 --> 35:48.700
for Jack and his work?

35:52.790 --> 35:55.420
Mm. People inside Army
intelligence think

35:55.500 --> 35:58.960
that you and he have
been meeting secretly.

35:59.050 --> 36:03.390
But I see now that that is
not possible, considering.

36:03.470 --> 36:05.220
Considering what?

36:05.300 --> 36:07.680
That you're...

36:10.310 --> 36:14.100
That you're in London
and he's in Los Angeles.

36:14.190 --> 36:16.360
You can help clear his name.

36:16.440 --> 36:18.900
And why would I do that?

36:19.900 --> 36:21.280
'Cause...

36:21.360 --> 36:23.110
he believes in you...

36:23.200 --> 36:24.950
and he needs your help.

36:25.030 --> 36:28.120
You have no idea what he needs.

36:28.200 --> 36:30.160
I'm his best friend.

36:30.250 --> 36:31.960
"I'm his <i>best</i> friend."

36:32.040 --> 36:34.750
"His best friend."

36:34.830 --> 36:38.590
Fucking rubbish.

36:42.510 --> 36:44.470
I can't imagine that...

36:44.550 --> 36:48.060
"Canadian tri" comes cheap
during wartime.

36:49.850 --> 36:51.310
Not to mention these...

36:51.390 --> 36:53.190
lovely living quarters.

36:53.270 --> 36:56.860
I'm guessing Jack and his money
help fund that.

36:56.940 --> 37:00.570
Do you know where
Jack's funding comes from?

37:02.070 --> 37:04.200
The United States government.

37:04.280 --> 37:05.570
So...

37:05.660 --> 37:08.780
unless you want
all this to dry up...

37:08.870 --> 37:12.620
I need you to help me help him.

37:39.730 --> 37:41.280
Sorry for the delay.
We'll be with you

37:41.360 --> 37:42.940
as soon as we get
our end sorted.

37:43.940 --> 37:46.240
Take all the time you need.

38:03.590 --> 38:05.590
- I got it from here.
- Yes, sir.

38:08.680 --> 38:11.470
So, how can I help you,
Mr. Miller?

38:14.770 --> 38:18.350
The leader of the "satanic cult"

38:18.440 --> 38:20.940
has a confession to make.

38:26.490 --> 38:28.450
I know the D.A. wants
a big arrest

38:28.530 --> 38:31.580
to splash across
the front pages.

38:31.660 --> 38:34.040
Is this all true?

38:34.120 --> 38:35.750
If I sign it,

38:35.830 --> 38:38.540
won't that make it true?

38:38.620 --> 38:41.040
Why would you do that?

38:41.130 --> 38:44.090
As Moses said to Pharaoh,

38:44.170 --> 38:46.550
"Let my people go."

38:46.630 --> 38:50.680
All you have on them
are petty crimes.

38:50.760 --> 38:53.890
Why not give people
what they really want?

38:53.970 --> 38:57.980
The man corrupting
their fair city behind bars

38:58.060 --> 39:00.270
and away from their children.

39:00.350 --> 39:02.230
It's not the public
that I'm concerned with.

39:02.310 --> 39:03.480
It's the law.

39:03.570 --> 39:06.320
Your law is your city's.

39:06.400 --> 39:09.280
Mine is love.

39:09.360 --> 39:12.490
Both inspire loyalty.

39:12.570 --> 39:14.280
Both...

39:14.370 --> 39:17.660
make us do things we regret.

39:17.750 --> 39:20.290
And what is it that you regret,
Mr. Miller?

39:20.370 --> 39:22.750
Assuming that the D.A.
will agree.

39:24.210 --> 39:27.460
I would confess to adultery,

39:27.550 --> 39:29.670
to perversion,

39:29.760 --> 39:32.680
to sodomy.

39:32.760 --> 39:37.600
I'd confess to encouraging
behaviors and lifestyles

39:37.680 --> 39:40.850
offensive to the people
of Los Angeles,

39:40.940 --> 39:44.440
as well as fraud:

39:44.520 --> 39:48.280
claiming I can heal the sick,

39:48.360 --> 39:51.320
communicate
with the spirit world,

39:51.400 --> 39:54.660
perform miracles...

39:54.740 --> 39:56.080
when...

39:56.160 --> 39:57.990
really, I am...

39:58.080 --> 40:00.460
just a man.

40:00.540 --> 40:03.170
Imperfect.

40:03.250 --> 40:05.250
Like you.

40:45.630 --> 40:48.000
Joseph?

40:48.090 --> 40:49.460
How?

40:52.420 --> 40:53.760
Oh, my God.

40:53.840 --> 40:55.590
Oh, I'm so sorry.

41:00.470 --> 41:02.930
You okay?

41:06.940 --> 41:08.060
Walter.

41:08.150 --> 41:09.570
Hey.

41:09.650 --> 41:11.440
- It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

41:13.650 --> 41:15.360
Let's get you cleaned up.

41:15.450 --> 41:16.620
Yeah, sounds good.

41:16.700 --> 41:18.160
You're home now, baby.

41:20.830 --> 41:23.000
Joan? What's wrong?

41:25.000 --> 41:27.250
Where's Alfred?

41:35.130 --> 41:37.680
Yes, sir, Agent Wallace,
I can hear you loud and clear.

41:37.760 --> 41:38.930
Great.

41:39.010 --> 41:41.060
I have Mr. Parsons here with me.

41:42.890 --> 41:46.390
I'd like you to tell him
what you told me earlier.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.940
I found him, Jack.

41:49.020 --> 41:51.940
Crowley. He's in London.

41:52.030 --> 41:54.400
You've been telling the truth.

41:54.490 --> 41:56.506
There's no way you could
have been meeting with him.

41:56.530 --> 41:59.320
He's been here the entire war.

41:59.410 --> 42:02.240
Could you repeat
that, Mr. Onsted?

42:02.330 --> 42:04.910
I'm not sure that
Mr. Parsons heard you.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.790
Aleister Crowley's here, Jack.

42:07.870 --> 42:09.830
He's sick with syphilis.

42:09.920 --> 42:12.090
Guy can barely leave his room.

42:12.170 --> 42:14.130
I even got him to give me
a signed affidavit

42:14.210 --> 42:15.920
attesting to his whereabouts.

42:16.010 --> 42:18.300
I've passed it along
to Agent Wallace

42:18.390 --> 42:22.010
and asked that your clearance
be reinstated immediately.

42:22.100 --> 42:24.430
This obviously was just
a big misunderstanding.

42:24.520 --> 42:27.100
Thank you for the
illuminating information,

42:27.190 --> 42:28.940
Mr. Onsted.
Safe travels home.

42:29.020 --> 42:31.230
No, no, no.
Richard, wait.

42:32.980 --> 42:34.820
He's mistaken.

42:34.900 --> 42:37.490
Crowley can't be in London.
He was gonna meet me.

42:37.570 --> 42:39.570
He gave this card...

42:41.740 --> 42:44.330
The war and
all the stress you're under,

42:44.410 --> 42:45.910
it can get to people.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
No, General,
that's not what's happening.

42:48.080 --> 42:50.960
Richard doesn't know Crowley
from Adam.

42:51.040 --> 42:52.340
Maybe he's...

42:52.420 --> 42:54.670
- maybe he's trying to set me up.
- Son,

42:54.750 --> 42:56.210
he-he was trying to help you.

42:56.300 --> 42:58.470
Jack, this whole time
I was convinced

42:58.550 --> 43:00.470
that you were dangerous.

43:00.550 --> 43:04.810
And I thought that what was
in here helped prove it.

43:14.070 --> 43:16.320
But it turns out...

43:16.400 --> 43:19.530
that you're just delusional.

43:40.090 --> 43:42.640
You have ten minutes,
Mr. Miller.

43:51.690 --> 43:54.150
Why didn't you tell me?

43:56.650 --> 44:00.280
You built us a beautiful home.

44:00.360 --> 44:04.490
Based on love
and freedom, trust.

44:06.160 --> 44:09.120
I violated that trust.

44:11.370 --> 44:13.420
You didn't act alone.

44:15.500 --> 44:18.380
You made those recordings
for Master Crowley, didn't you?

44:21.340 --> 44:23.260
I know how difficult
it must have been

44:23.340 --> 44:25.350
for you to keep it
secret from us.

44:26.850 --> 44:30.350
That only one man
could demand such loyalty.

44:30.430 --> 44:33.770
Crowley is...

44:33.850 --> 44:36.520
complicated.

44:36.610 --> 44:38.110
Full of wisdom.

44:38.190 --> 44:40.320
Full of... vice.

44:40.400 --> 44:43.410
But with an invincible spirit.

44:43.490 --> 44:47.330
When he sent me here
to spread his new religion,

44:47.410 --> 44:50.450
he wanted a way to know
his congregation,

44:50.540 --> 44:54.120
even if he never had a chance
to meet them in the flesh.

44:54.210 --> 44:56.960
The recordings...

44:57.040 --> 44:59.750
were my solution.

45:01.380 --> 45:04.470
I was carrying out his wishes,

45:04.550 --> 45:07.220
but...

45:07.300 --> 45:11.640
I accept full responsibility
as Magus.

45:11.720 --> 45:13.560
Perhaps you were.

45:15.060 --> 45:17.860
But you have
another responsibility now.

45:36.750 --> 45:38.630
I'll-I'll get out of here.

45:38.710 --> 45:42.550
I'll... I'll figure something.

45:44.420 --> 45:47.140
How?

46:26.590 --> 46:28.510
Where's Susan?

46:28.590 --> 46:31.680
She went to go see Alfred.

46:33.180 --> 46:36.270
He turned himself in, so
the others could go free.

46:37.770 --> 46:40.060
Is she trying to bail him out?

46:40.150 --> 46:43.530
No. She said she had something
important to tell him.

46:48.110 --> 46:49.610
Are you okay?

46:49.700 --> 46:51.910
You were out at
Braxton's all day.

46:51.990 --> 46:54.200
I was starting to
worry about you.

46:56.870 --> 47:00.920
Whatever it is,
you can trust me, I won't tell.

47:03.710 --> 47:06.590
I see things.

47:06.670 --> 47:09.090
Things other people don't.

47:09.180 --> 47:10.890
I know.
You're a visionary.

47:10.970 --> 47:13.760
This house, your company...

47:13.850 --> 47:16.470
all came into existence

47:16.560 --> 47:18.270
because you saw
what others couldn't.

47:18.350 --> 47:21.270
Do you really believe that?

47:21.350 --> 47:23.820
I believe in you.

47:29.570 --> 47:32.160
Tell me what you want.

47:34.830 --> 47:37.120
I'll go first.

47:48.010 --> 47:50.050
I want it all.
