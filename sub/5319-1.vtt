01:58.181 --> 02:00.822
82 on scene. Possible 51/50.

02:07.401 --> 02:09.481
Copy that, AV-2. Paramedics in route.

02:10.082 --> 02:11.249
Oh, shit.

02:11.250 --> 02:13.548
AV-2 to control. I can't wait for a bus.

02:14.339 --> 02:15.682
What's the problem, AV-2?

02:15.683 --> 02:18.001
It's Pernell Harris.
I've got to get him out.

02:26.930 --> 02:28.118
Judge Harris.

02:28.363 --> 02:29.543
Judge Harris!

02:30.329 --> 02:31.605
Can you hear me?

02:35.501 --> 02:37.428
Judge Harris, my name is Sergeant Kessler

02:37.449 --> 02:39.229
from the San Vicente police department.

02:41.384 --> 02:42.680
Let me help you out.

02:43.460 --> 02:44.897
Is his name on any of the paperwork?

02:44.898 --> 02:46.667
He's a John Doe under observation.

02:46.668 --> 02:47.836
Not even admitted.

02:48.395 --> 02:49.433
How is he?

02:49.434 --> 02:51.515
We ran a full battery of diagnostic tests.

02:51.516 --> 02:53.313
Aside from being slightly dehydrated,

02:53.314 --> 02:54.631
he's in perfect health.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.862
They found him naked in
the middle of a fountain.

02:56.863 --> 02:59.119
- It can't be all good.
- I meant physically.

02:59.120 --> 03:02.230
Mentally and emotionally, you can
probably answer that better than me.

03:09.976 --> 03:11.163
Nice shirt.

03:14.626 --> 03:15.932
You okay?

03:17.465 --> 03:19.105
You better tell me you're okay.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.724
I'm okay.

03:24.194 --> 03:25.717
Let's get you home.

03:26.828 --> 03:28.732
I need to talk to PJ first.

03:28.733 --> 03:30.690
Pernell, we talked about this.

03:31.256 --> 03:32.746
You don't get a say in this, doc.

03:32.747 --> 03:33.659
No offense.

03:33.660 --> 03:35.637
I think the doctor's just being careful.

03:35.968 --> 03:37.324
You... you need to rest.

03:37.325 --> 03:39.332
- We'll... we'll see PJ later.
- No.

03:40.363 --> 03:42.253
Hold on, Pernell. I'm
afraid I have to insist.

03:42.254 --> 03:44.337
You're talking in a tone
that implies an authority

03:44.338 --> 03:46.647
I don't think you have, Dr. Williams.

03:47.135 --> 03:48.626
What am I, on house arrest?

03:49.512 --> 03:51.988
Well, then, shut the fuck up
and get the fuck out of my way.

03:58.704 --> 03:59.977
Hey, there, little lady.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.099
Hi.

04:02.487 --> 04:03.769
How you holdin' up?

04:04.883 --> 04:06.107
Pretty good.

04:07.355 --> 04:08.806
Where's my boy?

04:09.044 --> 04:10.672
Room 757.

04:11.771 --> 04:13.576
It's down the hall to the left.

04:20.689 --> 04:22.592
I thought he didn't want to see PJ.

04:22.966 --> 04:24.563
Guess he changed his mind.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.104
Well, is he okay?

04:28.077 --> 04:29.550
I don't know.

04:41.181 --> 04:42.381
Hey, PJ.

04:44.309 --> 04:45.477
I'm here.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.406
I thought you'd be up by now.

04:59.195 --> 05:00.924
I should have known.

05:01.141 --> 05:03.309
You always knew how to milk the moment.

05:30.084 --> 05:31.775
If you can hear me...

05:35.063 --> 05:36.820
Just squeeze my hand.

05:42.474 --> 05:44.031
One little squeeze.

05:51.976 --> 05:54.985
Come on, slugger. Show me somethin'.

06:04.909 --> 06:07.236
You can't give me one little squeeze?

06:15.631 --> 06:16.506
Thank you.

06:30.325 --> 06:32.438
Dr. Chatwin said that, um...

06:33.196 --> 06:37.179
PJ was so young and healthy, he, um...

06:37.640 --> 06:40.983
He can give the gift
of life to eight people.

06:48.318 --> 06:50.228
If he doesn't make it.

06:52.851 --> 06:55.690
Dr. Chatwin said he already didn't make it.

06:57.211 --> 06:59.829
We just need to decide
when to turn the machine off.

07:02.817 --> 07:03.817
You better keep your mouth shut

07:03.818 --> 07:05.901
about me cryin' when you wake up.

07:07.401 --> 07:08.945
Just so you know...

07:09.474 --> 07:13.384
When you do wake up, you
get whatever you want.

07:14.571 --> 07:16.263
I'm puttin' everything on the table.

07:16.957 --> 07:18.758
Even the money for your startup.

07:18.759 --> 07:20.265
You want to catch lightning?

07:21.843 --> 07:24.017
I will gladly pay for the goddamn bottle,

07:25.405 --> 07:27.567
but you got to wake up first. Deal?

07:28.464 --> 07:29.944
Why don't we start with the promise

07:29.962 --> 07:32.186
you already made to me?

07:39.308 --> 07:41.604
You said you'd make sure he paid.

07:43.063 --> 07:45.151
Remember that?

07:46.130 --> 07:48.192
Yeah, I do remember, PJ,

07:48.193 --> 07:49.900
and I will.

07:51.236 --> 07:53.299
But they got to find the guy first.

07:53.913 --> 07:55.856
You find him.

07:56.994 --> 07:58.040
What?

07:58.041 --> 07:59.651
Pernell?

08:00.554 --> 08:02.084
He, uh...

08:04.888 --> 08:07.104
You got to talk to him as if he's awake,

08:07.105 --> 08:08.480
even if he's not.

08:08.481 --> 08:10.454
I heard that someplace.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.458
You made a promise to me.

08:19.919 --> 08:21.492
Keep it.

08:26.894 --> 08:28.090
Let's go.

08:40.668 --> 08:42.457
Ah, somebody tagged the sign?

08:42.458 --> 08:44.390
Shit. Perfect.

08:44.770 --> 08:47.348
Asa, call Burk over in public works.

08:47.349 --> 08:49.258
Tell him to get this sign fixed immediately.

08:49.259 --> 08:50.359
You got his number?

09:01.755 --> 09:03.526
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

09:05.771 --> 09:07.872
I appreciate you coming
out on short notice, Guy.

09:07.873 --> 09:08.813
My pleasure, Mr. Mayor,

09:08.814 --> 09:10.527
but did I misread the invitation?

09:10.528 --> 09:12.334
I didn't know this was a black tie affair.

09:12.335 --> 09:14.320
Walking my daughter down
the aisle in about an hour,

09:14.321 --> 09:16.312
but I wanted to show you something first.

09:16.831 --> 09:18.308
Did you ever heard of Ardenwood?

09:18.309 --> 09:19.992
It's the pride of Fremont.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.743
Big old farm that's the same today

09:21.744 --> 09:23.083
as it was 120 years ago.

09:23.084 --> 09:25.399
You go there and you can
churn butter or milk a cow.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.282
Sounds like a good time.

09:26.283 --> 09:28.104
This is the place where time stops.

09:29.174 --> 09:31.599
Does that sound like a good
home for Brooks Innovations?

09:31.600 --> 09:34.029
Well, Mr. Brooks would rather have
his headquarters in San Vicente.

09:34.030 --> 09:35.405
I think that's pretty obvious.

09:35.406 --> 09:37.973
And then why the fuck did you
re-open negotiations with Fremont?

09:37.974 --> 09:40.765
Mr. Brooks believes in keeping
all his options open, just in case.

09:40.766 --> 09:42.347
Things have been done that
can't be taken back. All right?

09:42.348 --> 09:44.544
Too much money has passed hands
to be havin' second thoughts.

09:45.060 --> 09:46.818
This train is moving, understand?

09:46.819 --> 09:49.191
I do, but is everyone we
need still on the train?

09:49.192 --> 09:50.951
- Hell yes.
- Even Judge Harris?

09:50.952 --> 09:53.135
We heard he missed a few
days of work last week.

09:53.136 --> 09:54.173
Didn't tell anybody.

09:54.174 --> 09:55.915
Heard how they found him yesterday too.

09:55.916 --> 09:57.914
The man's son shot himself in the head.

09:58.182 --> 10:00.495
If he had a few bad days,
I think he gets a pass.

10:00.496 --> 10:02.216
Of course he does. Any man would.

10:02.217 --> 10:04.310
But a big part of our
plan to make San Vicente

10:04.311 --> 10:05.896
the epicenter of Brooks Innovations

10:05.897 --> 10:07.315
hinges on the judge.

10:07.316 --> 10:08.787
Grieving can be a long process.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.441
Pernell can multitask.

10:10.442 --> 10:11.468
As soon as we know that for sure,

10:11.469 --> 10:13.099
we'll stop looking at other options.

10:13.100 --> 10:13.968
Yeah.

10:18.102 --> 10:19.671
Sorry to pull you out of your game, chief.

10:19.672 --> 10:21.278
Something like this, I
figured I should just call.

10:21.279 --> 10:22.570
Stop apologizing.

10:22.596 --> 10:24.589
- Where is he?
- Detective squad room.

10:24.960 --> 10:25.780
I'm sorry, judge.

10:25.781 --> 10:27.609
I'm not authorized to show you the file.

10:27.610 --> 10:30.520
Fine. Don't show me anything.

10:30.544 --> 10:33.165
Just verbally express to
me the list of the suspects.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.305
Can you at least do that?

10:34.428 --> 10:35.819
Easy, Pernell.

10:36.322 --> 10:37.575
We're the good guys, remember?

10:37.576 --> 10:39.003
Toby, you need to talk to this guy.

10:39.671 --> 10:41.732
He's not telling me anything
about Jocelyn's case.

10:41.939 --> 10:43.374
That's 'cause he's not on the case.

10:43.375 --> 10:44.564
Well, shouldn't he be?

10:44.591 --> 10:46.099
Shouldn't the whole department be?

10:46.100 --> 10:47.496
Her case is my top priority.

10:47.497 --> 10:49.295
- I have my three best on it.
- Really?

10:50.416 --> 10:52.427
Some piece of shit rapes my daughter-in-law,

10:52.428 --> 10:54.304
has my son watch the whole goddamn thing,

10:54.305 --> 10:56.800
and he's walkin' around free
for seven fuckin' months?

10:56.801 --> 10:58.029
Not from lack of trying.

10:58.030 --> 10:59.439
You know what you can do in seven months,

10:59.440 --> 11:00.931
if you're trying?

11:00.932 --> 11:02.863
You can build a house from the ground up.

11:02.864 --> 11:04.375
Go around the world in a sailboat.

11:04.376 --> 11:05.688
Hell, you can have a fuckin' baby

11:05.689 --> 11:07.306
in seven months if you'll press.

11:07.307 --> 11:09.736
I am pushing this case as hard
as if it were my own daughter.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.854
Then you must not give a
shit about your own daughter.

11:14.192 --> 11:16.133
You're under strain right now.

11:16.715 --> 11:17.957
I'm going to let that slide.

11:17.958 --> 11:19.300
No, I don't want you to let it slide.

11:19.301 --> 11:21.292
I want you to let me see the file!

11:21.293 --> 11:23.906
Not while it's active.

11:23.907 --> 11:25.091
Why not?

11:25.581 --> 11:28.510
I'm a judge! I'm family of the victim!

11:28.787 --> 11:30.599
You worried about somebody
checkin' on your work?

11:35.522 --> 11:36.849
Pull the file.

11:37.517 --> 11:39.763
Make a copy for the judge.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.035
You made us miss the ceremony.

11:43.135 --> 11:44.721
I wasn't up for a wedding.

11:46.191 --> 11:47.518
You think I was?

11:47.519 --> 11:49.443
Just figured it's your
best friend's daughter,

11:49.444 --> 11:52.843
so out of respect, you should show up.

11:52.844 --> 11:54.582
So I got my shit together.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.464
Instead you go to the police station?

11:56.465 --> 11:58.707
Somebody had to light a
fire under Toby's ass.

12:00.737 --> 12:02.403
Wish you could have told me.

12:03.042 --> 12:05.534
I was this close from calling 911 again.

12:06.291 --> 12:08.017
You know, Crystal, I'm a grown man.

12:08.018 --> 12:09.104
I mean, you don't have to call the police

12:09.105 --> 12:11.042
every time I leave the goddamn house.

12:14.128 --> 12:15.336
I'm sorry.

12:17.321 --> 12:19.079
The last time you left here,

12:19.640 --> 12:21.951
you didn't come back for three days.

12:21.952 --> 12:23.671
What... no, actually, you never came back.

12:23.672 --> 12:25.246
They found you.

12:25.247 --> 12:26.306
Naked.

12:26.307 --> 12:27.508
In the middle of a fountain.

12:27.509 --> 12:29.128
But, hey, at least you were alive.

12:29.819 --> 12:31.663
At least I didn't lose my husband and my son

12:31.664 --> 12:33.301
in the course of a week.

12:37.025 --> 12:38.736
I should have left you a note.

12:39.785 --> 12:41.255
You okay?

12:43.693 --> 12:46.224
- You're asking too much of me.
- I'm sorry.

12:52.186 --> 12:54.814
So you want to tell me where you
disappeared to for three days?

12:56.878 --> 12:58.362
It's, uh...

13:00.034 --> 13:01.489
All kind of a blur.

13:01.490 --> 13:05.758
Okay. Why don't we start with
what happened to your clothes?

13:08.902 --> 13:10.498
I left them at the church.

13:10.920 --> 13:11.847
What?

13:12.272 --> 13:14.165
I think I got baptized.

13:15.724 --> 13:16.985
By who?

13:22.196 --> 13:22.926
Hello.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.299
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:24.870 --> 13:27.973
I have a check drawn from
this bank I'd love to cash.

13:30.755 --> 13:32.245
One moment, please.

13:48.209 --> 13:49.995
Your teller verified the signature,

13:50.022 --> 13:51.386
and the amount can't be a problem.

13:51.387 --> 13:53.339
I'm sure Mr. Harris' account
could cover that check

13:53.340 --> 13:55.787
a hundred times over. Am I right?

13:55.788 --> 13:57.862
Judge Harris must have been
in a very generous mood.

13:57.863 --> 13:59.322
Well, he caught the spirit.

13:59.323 --> 14:01.078
What she means is God called him,

14:01.079 --> 14:02.730
and he answered. Praise the Lord.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.308
That's wonderful,

14:04.309 --> 14:07.159
except we can't cash a
check this size on the spot.

14:07.160 --> 14:08.984
I'd be happy to open an account with, say,

14:08.985 --> 14:10.773
a $5,000 starting balance?

14:10.774 --> 14:12.875
We could get the other 45 in cash.

14:12.915 --> 14:14.303
What's the name of your church again?

14:14.304 --> 14:15.772
The Hand of God Chapel.

14:16.078 --> 14:18.313
It's a spirit-filled ministry.

14:23.533 --> 14:26.003
Uh, and you're a registered 501-3C?

14:26.004 --> 14:28.350
Technically that piece
of paperwork's pending.

14:28.351 --> 14:29.972
It should be official any day now.

14:30.342 --> 14:32.683
Best I can do is put a
three-day hold on the check.

14:35.326 --> 14:38.380
You really think the Lord's
work should wait three days?

14:39.117 --> 14:40.490
I'm sorry.

14:44.863 --> 14:46.530
You mind if I visit your restroom?

14:46.531 --> 14:47.252
Uh, certainly.

14:47.253 --> 14:49.139
It's, uh, just to the left of reception.

14:49.495 --> 14:50.551
Mm.

14:57.344 --> 14:59.170
Do you ever make exceptions?

14:59.171 --> 15:00.972
I'd already be making an exception.

15:00.973 --> 15:04.554
Normally there's a seven-day
hold on amounts over $10,000.

15:04.555 --> 15:05.834
Mm.

15:06.972 --> 15:11.613
But theoretically is there
ever a case where, uh,

15:11.614 --> 15:14.803
you could cash a check
like this on the spot?

15:17.667 --> 15:19.937
Theoretically, um...

15:20.958 --> 15:23.169
I suppose that there are some times,

15:24.082 --> 15:27.938
special circumstances that warrant
cashing a check of this size.

15:28.383 --> 15:29.195
Hm.

15:29.610 --> 15:33.200
God needs Paul to save souls, Mr. O'Neill,

15:34.216 --> 15:36.775
and that is a 24/7 fight.

15:37.891 --> 15:40.102
Because Satan doesn't take time off.

15:40.498 --> 15:44.449
Not three days or three hours

15:44.450 --> 15:46.498
or even three minutes.

15:48.254 --> 15:52.360
So I need you to tell me

15:52.647 --> 15:54.845
what it would take for our circumstances

15:54.846 --> 15:56.646
to be considered special.

16:08.881 --> 16:10.372
$45,000.

16:11.752 --> 16:13.089
Here you are, sir.

16:16.219 --> 16:17.658
God bless you.

16:18.015 --> 16:19.134
You have a good day.

16:19.135 --> 16:20.487
You too.

16:25.328 --> 16:26.772
Oh, no. Those are for after.

16:29.235 --> 16:30.783
I thought it started at 5:00.

16:32.290 --> 16:33.530
Oh.

16:35.361 --> 16:36.803
Well, take a seat.

16:42.548 --> 16:43.892
Uh, closer.

16:43.893 --> 16:45.350
This one's good.

16:45.840 --> 16:47.071
I don't bite.

16:49.962 --> 16:51.223
Thank you for coming.

16:51.658 --> 16:53.297
I thought we'd open with a prayer.

17:00.098 --> 17:03.267
Heavenly Father, we ask that
you bless this Bible study.

17:03.975 --> 17:07.974
We know that we're not worthy
of your love or protections,

17:07.976 --> 17:10.095
but you give it to us unconditionally.

17:10.634 --> 17:13.387
In the name of Jesus we pray. Amen.

17:15.805 --> 17:17.349
Oh. Amen.

17:18.492 --> 17:19.635
You didn't bring a Bible?

17:19.813 --> 17:21.354
I ain't got a Bible.

17:29.484 --> 17:31.370
Now this is a...

17:31.371 --> 17:32.776
It's kind of a checklist from David

17:32.777 --> 17:34.533
on how good the Lord is.

17:35.442 --> 17:39.874
People say... hm, people might say

17:40.355 --> 17:42.099
"What's so good about God?"

17:42.516 --> 17:44.918
and now you... Hey, Montgomery.

17:45.348 --> 17:46.820
You here for the Bible study?

17:46.821 --> 17:48.728
Ha! It's game time.

17:50.730 --> 17:52.221
Let's go!

17:52.781 --> 17:54.304
Would you mind turning that off, please?

17:54.305 --> 17:55.974
Nah. It's my team, dog.

18:04.242 --> 18:04.859
I'm sorry.

18:04.860 --> 18:06.787
This room is reserved for Bible study.

18:07.369 --> 18:09.478
You're welcome to join us if you'd like.

18:11.581 --> 18:12.530
What the fuck?

18:21.760 --> 18:24.271
Give me this motherfuckin' remote, man.

18:24.272 --> 18:26.852
Don't nobody give a fuck
about your Bible study, K.D.

18:26.853 --> 18:29.196
Shoot, meth-mouth, he
only here for the donuts.

18:29.584 --> 18:31.415
You can pray all you want, preacher boy,

18:31.683 --> 18:33.175
but the TV...

18:33.176 --> 18:34.718
stays on.

18:42.266 --> 18:46.892
Tico, would you start
reading verse eight, please?

18:48.877 --> 18:51.169
"The lord is gracious and merciful..."

18:51.170 --> 18:53.459
Oh, you got to take that to the house!

18:53.460 --> 18:55.231
"Slow to anger and
abounding in steadfast love."

18:55.232 --> 18:56.972
- "The lord is good to all"
- Come on, get loose!

18:56.973 --> 18:58.781
"And mercy is over all that he has made."

18:58.782 --> 19:00.306
You gotta catch that! Come o...

19:00.307 --> 19:01.361
Ohh!

19:04.951 --> 19:07.275
You're gonna respect God's time!

19:08.825 --> 19:10.455
Oof!

19:13.272 --> 19:14.907
You don't fool me, motherfucker.

19:22.356 --> 19:23.966
It's not over?

19:31.461 --> 19:33.460
I'm sorry we missed Zoie's wedding.

19:33.786 --> 19:35.546
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
you'll get another shot.

19:35.547 --> 19:38.033
That girl's mighty fickle. How's Pernell?

19:38.034 --> 19:39.571
You heard how they found him, right?

19:40.084 --> 19:41.883
Did you know he gave 50 grand to a preacher

19:41.884 --> 19:42.860
he's never met before?

19:42.861 --> 19:44.186
He thinks he might be born again.

19:44.187 --> 19:45.580
If he doesn't get a grip real quick,

19:45.581 --> 19:47.202
it's gonna cost us a lot more than that.

19:49.540 --> 19:50.899
Went through the rape database.

19:50.900 --> 19:53.509
This guy in Sebastopol, serial rapist.

19:53.510 --> 19:54.726
Same M.O.

19:55.090 --> 19:57.306
Has the husband watch
while he's rapin' the wife.

19:57.713 --> 19:59.336
They ruled him out.

19:59.337 --> 20:00.686
Can you believe that shit?

20:00.707 --> 20:02.171
Toby know about this?

20:02.172 --> 20:03.902
He's leaving out the part

20:03.903 --> 20:06.072
about how the guy's been in San Quentin

20:06.073 --> 20:07.697
the past three years.

20:07.921 --> 20:09.970
He probably figured he
didn't break out of prison,

20:09.971 --> 20:11.830
rape Jocelyn, and then...

20:12.434 --> 20:13.688
Break back into prison.

20:13.689 --> 20:16.055
You know, you got to think
outside the box here.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.757
Maybe somebody let him out.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.233
Maybe motherfucker had a cellmate

20:19.234 --> 20:20.492
he taught all his tricks to.

20:20.493 --> 20:21.785
A protege did it.

20:24.472 --> 20:25.753
When was the last time you slept?

20:26.296 --> 20:27.640
Been a few days.

20:28.650 --> 20:30.753
Hm, didn't shower either.

20:32.463 --> 20:33.739
I talked to Guy.

20:34.137 --> 20:35.714
He said Mr. Brooks and everybody

20:35.715 --> 20:37.398
at Brooks Innovations
send their condolences.

20:37.399 --> 20:38.998
Yeah, everybody's sending
condolences and flowers

20:38.999 --> 20:40.801
like PJ's already fucking dead.

20:41.523 --> 20:43.272
They're worried about you.
They need to know you're okay.

20:43.273 --> 20:44.500
Well, I'm not okay!

20:46.041 --> 20:49.588
And I'm not gonna be okay
until I keep my promise to PJ.

20:55.578 --> 20:57.842
Then they need to think that
you're okay in the meantime,

20:58.144 --> 20:59.909
or they might think about
taking their project elsewhere.

20:59.910 --> 21:01.159
See what I mean?

21:02.423 --> 21:03.572
They said that?

21:03.573 --> 21:04.681
To my face.

21:04.843 --> 21:06.842
I told 'em not to worry. I know you.

21:07.167 --> 21:08.666
And as hard as it is right now,

21:08.667 --> 21:10.793
you'll pull through. You
always do what it takes.

21:10.794 --> 21:11.997
I'm fine.

21:11.998 --> 21:13.341
I told 'em you'd be back to work Monday.

21:13.342 --> 21:15.286
- I wasn't lying, was I?
- I'll be there.

21:16.896 --> 21:18.244
I'll be there.

21:23.941 --> 21:25.428
I got to do the whole four?

21:26.103 --> 21:27.436
I thought you said two years.

21:27.437 --> 21:28.823
I was pushing for two.

21:28.824 --> 21:30.666
But you caught a bad break
with the judge on this.

21:30.667 --> 21:31.683
How's that?

21:31.684 --> 21:33.121
The guy you're goin' in front of?

21:33.122 --> 21:35.925
They call him Judge Maximum,
as in maximum sentence.

21:36.547 --> 21:38.322
If you walk in without this plea,

21:38.323 --> 21:40.803
I guarantee he will not
only revoke your parole,

21:41.223 --> 21:43.755
but he'll tack on the maximum
sentence for this latest offense.

21:46.294 --> 21:47.545
Sorry.

22:01.223 --> 22:02.991
Good morning, Mrs. Harris.

22:03.092 --> 22:04.259
I'm Sergeant Kessler.

22:04.359 --> 22:08.163
- Is your husband around?
- He's at work.

22:08.263 --> 22:10.999
Oh, I thought he'd be taking a few days off.

22:11.100 --> 22:13.535
No, he's fine. Why?

22:13.635 --> 22:16.205
- Bail is set at 50,000.
- That's not right, Your Honor.

22:16.305 --> 22:17.339
My client's not a flight risk.

22:17.439 --> 22:19.374
People versus Keith Dennison.

22:23.578 --> 22:25.280
You have anything to say, Mr. Dennison,

22:25.380 --> 22:28.317
before I send your sorry ass back to prison?

22:29.718 --> 22:31.186
Yes, sir.

22:35.457 --> 22:40.195
I believe God has a plan for everyone.

22:40.295 --> 22:42.897
Me standing in front of you right now,

22:42.997 --> 22:44.799
it's part of his plan.

22:44.899 --> 22:46.368
This ain't a coincidence.

22:46.468 --> 22:48.503
No, it's not a coincidence, Mr. Dennison.

22:48.603 --> 22:52.341
You beat a man, and that's against the law.

22:52.441 --> 22:56.145
But my calling is to spread the word of God,

22:56.178 --> 22:58.147
and I'm pretty sure the
devil was using Montgomery

22:58.180 --> 23:00.749
to try to stop me.

23:00.849 --> 23:03.418
I'd do it again.

23:06.155 --> 23:08.022
Play it again?

23:15.364 --> 23:16.898
What the hell language is that?

23:16.998 --> 23:18.533
- Sound like Muslim.
- You mean Arabic?

23:18.633 --> 23:19.901
I mean like a fuckin' terrorist.

23:20.001 --> 23:21.170
I hate to say it.

23:21.203 --> 23:22.937
He's speaking in tongues.

23:23.037 --> 23:24.906
My aunt does that at her church.

23:25.006 --> 23:27.176
Oh, Jesus Christ.

23:27.276 --> 23:28.977
If he's on some kind of religious trip...

23:29.077 --> 23:30.812
Who do we know that speaks tongues?

23:30.912 --> 23:32.046
Can you call your aunt down here?

23:32.181 --> 23:33.248
What the fuck? We're not looking

23:33.348 --> 23:34.449
for a tongue translator, all right?

23:34.549 --> 23:36.351
We want this buried, not shared.

23:36.451 --> 23:38.387
Show some respect for
your fucking godfather.

23:40.355 --> 23:42.191
So you don't care if you go back to prison?

23:42.257 --> 23:43.892
Better to lose favor in the eyes of man

23:43.992 --> 23:45.794
than in the eyes of the Lord.

23:45.894 --> 23:47.562
It's like you said,

23:47.662 --> 23:50.499
a man who knows his calling
must do everything in his power

23:50.599 --> 23:51.833
to live up to it.

24:01.876 --> 24:03.111
Have we met?

24:03.212 --> 24:05.580
Not officially, sir.

24:05.680 --> 24:10.285
I saw you get baptized at
Hand of God four days ago.

24:10.385 --> 24:14.456
You opened my eyes to
what it means to be saved,

24:14.556 --> 24:19.027
and now I see you're a modern day Solomon.

24:19.127 --> 24:21.230
So whatever decision you make here today,

24:21.263 --> 24:23.732
I'm good with it.

24:34.643 --> 24:37.246
Uh, Mr. Dennison, uh...

24:37.279 --> 24:38.947
Did you, uh...

24:39.047 --> 24:40.949
Did you fear for your safety

24:41.049 --> 24:45.387
or for the safety of anyone
around you at the time?

24:47.822 --> 24:49.624
Uh, yeah.

24:49.724 --> 24:51.125
Um, yes, sir.

24:51.260 --> 24:52.994
Montgomery's a big man.

24:53.094 --> 24:55.930
Your Honor, uh, Mr. Dennison
has already willingly

24:56.030 --> 24:57.131
signed a plea agreement.

24:57.266 --> 24:58.433
The question here is sentencing.

24:58.533 --> 25:00.101
So you acted to protect yourself?

25:00.269 --> 25:01.503
Yes, sir.

25:01.603 --> 25:03.438
Judge Harris, I'd like
to bring your attention

25:03.538 --> 25:06.641
to the timeline of violence
perpetrated by Mr. Dennison.

25:06.741 --> 25:09.578
It includes 11 assault and batteries for

25:09.678 --> 25:12.847
with a deadly weapon, negligent homicide,

25:12.947 --> 25:14.383
and 2 attempted murders.

25:14.483 --> 25:16.985
This man's never gone more
than six months without

25:17.085 --> 25:20.389
some sort of physical attack
on another human being,

25:20.489 --> 25:22.724
and these are only the ones we know about.

25:22.824 --> 25:25.994
I'm assuming that all this was
before you were born again, right?

25:26.094 --> 25:27.462
Yes, sir.

25:27.562 --> 25:29.364
Were you born again two days ago

25:29.464 --> 25:31.065
when you beat a man near to death

25:31.165 --> 25:32.767
because he wouldn't turn off the TV?

25:32.867 --> 25:35.169
He just said that that particular attack

25:35.304 --> 25:36.871
was in his own self-defense.

25:36.971 --> 25:39.308
The victim was sitting down
with his back to the defendant.

25:39.408 --> 25:40.775
Charge is dismissed.

25:40.875 --> 25:42.043
Praise God!

25:42.143 --> 25:43.445
Your Honor, we have a signed plea.

25:43.545 --> 25:45.780
Bang, bang, bang, Mr. McCauley.

25:45.880 --> 25:48.983
That means we're done.

26:02.196 --> 26:03.598
Oh.

26:03.698 --> 26:04.399
Ahh.

26:17.979 --> 26:20.849
Mm.

26:24.753 --> 26:27.922
Ah.

26:28.022 --> 26:29.057
Come on, Pernell.

26:29.157 --> 26:30.359
Randy's gonna be knocking soon.

26:30.459 --> 26:32.861
Two more minutes.

26:42.070 --> 26:43.738
Are you crying?

26:46.375 --> 26:49.077
Tess...

26:49.177 --> 26:50.945
This has to stop.

26:51.045 --> 26:52.146
What are you talkin' about?

26:52.246 --> 26:53.382
I mean, I love this.

26:53.448 --> 26:55.950
This is beautiful, but...

26:59.287 --> 27:01.155
I can't do this anymore.

27:01.255 --> 27:02.691
I'm married.

27:04.926 --> 27:08.196
You've been married for 20-some odd years.

27:08.296 --> 27:10.965
I know, but now I'm baptized.

27:11.065 --> 27:12.401
What?

27:13.402 --> 27:15.970
Yeah.

27:17.672 --> 27:20.409
I think I'm born again, and, uh,

27:20.442 --> 27:23.712
I'm pretty sure this is against the rules.

27:32.186 --> 27:33.321
Are you serious?

27:33.422 --> 27:35.490
Pernell Harris catching religion?

27:35.590 --> 27:37.426
That doesn't even sound right.

27:37.526 --> 27:40.462
But I still want to be friends.

27:42.196 --> 27:45.500
I love talkin' to you, Tessie.

27:45.600 --> 27:49.938
I don't want that to end.

27:55.544 --> 27:56.978
He's in a meeting.

27:57.078 --> 27:58.212
You think I give a damn?

27:58.312 --> 28:00.081
In a meeting!

28:03.685 --> 28:05.854
Sweetie, here's how this is gonna work.

28:05.954 --> 28:07.255
Okay?

28:07.355 --> 28:09.524
No more standing appointment.

28:09.624 --> 28:12.160
You want to see me, you call.

28:12.260 --> 28:15.464
If you do, I'll be here.

28:15.530 --> 28:17.466
Hour minimum, as usual.

28:17.499 --> 28:20.301
1,500 per hour, as usual.

28:20.469 --> 28:25.273
What we do... is up to you.

28:25.373 --> 28:27.175
We're just gonna talk.

28:27.275 --> 28:30.278
Hm.

28:30.378 --> 28:32.547
That's good.

28:35.550 --> 28:38.587
I like talking to you.

28:44.593 --> 28:46.661
Found this on the Internet.

28:46.761 --> 28:50.499
It's a story about people
who woke up from comas.

28:50.532 --> 28:53.768
Made me think of PJ.

29:03.878 --> 29:07.816
What does it fix if I turn off that machine?

29:07.916 --> 29:10.552
You've got a lot of healing to do,

29:10.652 --> 29:13.087
and we can't start wrestling
with the real issues

29:13.187 --> 29:16.625
until you say good-bye.

29:18.927 --> 29:23.532
I don't know if I'm ready for that.

29:23.632 --> 29:25.333
Is it because you're afraid

29:25.433 --> 29:28.302
you'll never get the answers you need?

29:28.402 --> 29:30.071
It's because it's my fault.

29:31.673 --> 29:34.543
That's what he told me in the note.

29:36.511 --> 29:39.314
You told everyone he didn't leave a note.

29:40.515 --> 29:42.116
The police...

29:42.216 --> 29:43.618
Me.

29:43.718 --> 29:46.455
Oh, well, he didn't leave it for you.

29:57.131 --> 29:58.900
He's in the crapper.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.569
You can go in.

30:04.005 --> 30:06.441
Ohh...

30:06.541 --> 30:08.843
What crawled up your ass and died?

30:08.943 --> 30:10.144
Ha ha ha.

30:10.244 --> 30:12.581
Doc put me on new blood pressure meds.

30:12.681 --> 30:14.516
They're givin' me the shits.

30:14.616 --> 30:16.485
I wouldn't make it from here
to my car without an accident.

30:16.585 --> 30:18.219
Your husband's not helping.

30:18.319 --> 30:22.090
Some whack job psychopath
came in spouting religious stuff.

30:22.190 --> 30:24.258
Pernell let him off scot-free.

30:24.359 --> 30:26.294
Supervising judge just opened a review.

30:26.395 --> 30:28.897
They're lookin' to suspend him.

30:30.098 --> 30:32.567
Well, you better get your ass

30:32.667 --> 30:34.703
in front of that, bobo.

30:34.803 --> 30:35.837
Trust me.

30:35.937 --> 30:37.305
As soon as I can get my ass off this toilet,

30:37.406 --> 30:38.907
I'll get to work on that.

30:39.007 --> 30:40.742
A lot of these little
fires we're dealin' with

30:40.842 --> 30:42.877
seem to be getting fueled by religion.

30:42.977 --> 30:45.580
I'm startin' to wonder about
Pernell's little baptism.

30:45.680 --> 30:47.215
A preacher with the wrong intentions

30:47.315 --> 30:50.685
could have a field day with him right now.

30:50.785 --> 30:52.987
- I'll talk to the preacher.
- Good.

30:53.087 --> 30:57.426
It's all hands on deck until
Pernell comes to his senses.

30:57.492 --> 31:01.496
Maybe I should tell the B.A.P.A.

31:01.596 --> 31:03.331
that Pernell can't make the award's dinner?

31:03.432 --> 31:05.233
Can't do that.

31:05.333 --> 31:07.469
Guy Guillet's sending a rep.

31:07.569 --> 31:09.538
Shit. They'll see for themselves

31:09.638 --> 31:12.106
Pernell's not on his rocker.

31:12.206 --> 31:13.842
Exactly.

31:13.942 --> 31:16.244
We need to manage this
from the Pernell side.

31:16.344 --> 31:17.712
I'll work on keeping him on the bench.

31:17.812 --> 31:20.982
You make sure that
preacher gets the message.

31:24.352 --> 31:27.589
Here.

31:27.689 --> 31:30.659
- Finish this.
- Ooh.

31:30.759 --> 31:33.828
Good for your blood pressure and the shits.

31:33.928 --> 31:37.566
Hey, send Asa in here.
I need some toilet paper.

31:51.145 --> 31:53.482
Can I help you?

31:53.582 --> 31:56.485
Oh, my God. I know you!

31:57.686 --> 31:59.253
From the soap, right?

31:59.353 --> 32:00.955
Young and the Restless.

32:01.055 --> 32:02.924
Right?

32:03.024 --> 32:04.559
Oh, my God, I can't remember
your character's name.

32:04.659 --> 32:06.661
- It was Josh.
- Josh.

32:06.761 --> 32:08.096
That was a long time ago. Wow.

32:09.498 --> 32:12.333
Reverend Curtis. It's a pleasure.

32:12.501 --> 32:14.603
Crystal Harris.

32:14.703 --> 32:17.706
I believe you baptized my husband.

32:22.577 --> 32:27.549
Tell me, how did you and
Pernell get so close?

32:27.649 --> 32:29.551
He came to me looking for answers,

32:29.651 --> 32:32.521
so I put him in touch with Jesus.

32:32.587 --> 32:36.057
And for that you get 50 grand?

32:36.157 --> 32:38.392
That's what a personal connection to Jesus

32:38.527 --> 32:39.994
is going for these days?

32:40.094 --> 32:41.896
I want you to know I
didn't ask for that money,

32:41.996 --> 32:44.198
but we're already putting
it to work for the Lord.

32:44.298 --> 32:45.534
Hm.

32:45.567 --> 32:49.103
That's a very nice suit you have on.

32:49.203 --> 32:51.105
New?

32:51.205 --> 32:54.976
But then everything
about you is kind of new,

32:55.076 --> 32:56.678
isn't it?

32:56.778 --> 33:01.315
Actor-turned-con-artist-turned preacher.

33:01.415 --> 33:02.751
Oh, I did my research.

33:02.851 --> 33:09.057
You weren't born Paul Curtis, were you...

33:09.157 --> 33:10.559
- Oliver?
- Hmm.

33:10.659 --> 33:13.261
When I got saved, I decided to take a name

33:13.361 --> 33:15.196
from the Bible.

33:17.331 --> 33:19.868
That makes sense.

33:19.968 --> 33:24.038
Was my husband making sense
when he wrote you that check?

33:24.138 --> 33:25.640
Don't... don't answer that.

33:25.740 --> 33:26.808
I don't want you to worry about that.

33:26.908 --> 33:28.577
I want you to keep that money.

33:28.643 --> 33:30.945
Just pretend you won the lottery,

33:31.045 --> 33:36.718
except this prize, it comes with a string,

33:36.818 --> 33:40.622
and if you don't stay the
hell away from my husband,

33:40.722 --> 33:43.457
I will pull that string,

33:43.592 --> 33:48.396
and I will use it...

33:48.496 --> 33:51.432
To strangle you.

33:51.600 --> 33:56.137
Everything about you.

33:56.237 --> 34:00.809
I don't understand why
you're in such a goddamn rush.

34:00.909 --> 34:02.644
I've talked to the experts, and they all say

34:02.744 --> 34:05.513
that there's no chance of getting PJ back.

34:05.614 --> 34:07.816
It's the way that he shot himself.

34:07.916 --> 34:09.918
- It's the part of the brain...
- Experts can be wrong,

34:10.018 --> 34:11.753
- you know?
- I'm not waiting.

34:15.356 --> 34:18.126
I would really like for us to agree

34:18.226 --> 34:20.895
so we can all say our
good-byes the right way.

34:20.995 --> 34:26.534
But I am his wife, and
I get to make this call.

34:26.635 --> 34:28.168
I'm sorry.

34:34.507 --> 34:36.043
Shit.

34:36.143 --> 34:40.982
Are we gonna go by what the movies say?

34:42.516 --> 34:44.652
No. TV?

34:45.920 --> 34:47.388
No.

34:47.487 --> 34:51.525
We have to define our manhood
by what the Bible says...

34:51.659 --> 34:52.560
- Paul.
- God damn it...

34:52.661 --> 34:54.896
He said it was important.

35:00.769 --> 35:03.237
I need you to pray over my son.

35:03.337 --> 35:05.974
I will. Here's the problem.

35:06.074 --> 35:08.877
I have a sermon to prepare.
Maybe tomorrow...

35:08.977 --> 35:10.679
They're talking about
pulling the plug on my boy.

35:10.745 --> 35:12.546
This is not a tomorrow situation.

35:12.681 --> 35:14.148
Why don't we take brother Harris'

35:14.248 --> 35:16.985
- request to prayer circle?
- That's a splendid idea!

35:17.085 --> 35:19.020
Even better for your son.
Matthew 18:20 says,

35:19.120 --> 35:20.722
"Where two or three are
gathered in my name."

35:20.822 --> 35:22.123
"I am present."

35:22.223 --> 35:23.692
Well, then bring the fucking prayer circle

35:23.758 --> 35:24.959
- to the goddamn hospital.
- Uh...

35:25.059 --> 35:26.795
What the fuck is your problem?

35:26.895 --> 35:29.731
I got a visit from your wife,
and she made it very clear

35:29.831 --> 35:31.099
that she would like to be involved

35:31.199 --> 35:33.534
in designing your spiritual path,

35:33.702 --> 35:36.437
and it probably wouldn't
involve Hand of God.

35:36.537 --> 35:38.707
Did she threaten you?

35:42.811 --> 35:46.047
There are things from my past

35:46.147 --> 35:53.321
that could severely damage
my ability to spread the word

35:53.421 --> 35:57.826
if they, uh... came to light.

35:57.926 --> 36:00.061
So this is a business decision.

36:02.997 --> 36:07.101
Did you know that my great
granddaddy built this city

36:07.201 --> 36:09.437
and it's been passed
down from one generation

36:09.537 --> 36:12.140
to the next ever since?

36:12.240 --> 36:15.844
My wife is a powerhouse,
there's no doubt about that,

36:15.944 --> 36:18.479
but she married up,

36:18.579 --> 36:20.949
and if there's anybody who
can hurt you in this town,

36:21.049 --> 36:26.287
it's the honorable Pernell fucking Harris.

36:29.223 --> 36:31.525
Everybody says he's dead, Lord,

36:31.625 --> 36:33.261
and they're ready to make it official,

36:33.361 --> 36:37.198
but we know where there
is a will, there is a way,

36:37.298 --> 36:40.468
and if it's God's will,
there is a path to life.

36:40.568 --> 36:42.904
Come on, son.

36:43.004 --> 36:44.505
It's okay. This is the way you check

36:44.605 --> 36:46.140
to see if he's comin' out of a coma.

36:46.240 --> 36:47.776
Keep goin'.

36:47.876 --> 36:52.113
So, Lord, we humbly ask
that you give us a sign.

36:52.213 --> 36:54.849
Not for us, but for the non-believers.

36:54.949 --> 36:56.684
Give me somethin', PJ.
Give me something now.

36:56.785 --> 36:57.919
Oh, Jesus.

36:58.019 --> 37:00.188
Help PJ! Show them, Lord.

37:00.288 --> 37:01.956
Right now that, yes, he is engaged...

37:02.056 --> 37:03.157
- Come on, PJ.
- In an epic battle,

37:03.257 --> 37:04.826
but he is not lost, he is not gone.

37:04.926 --> 37:06.594
- Move something.
- Make it quick, Lord!

37:06.694 --> 37:08.129
- Move!
- Give us a sign

37:08.229 --> 37:09.831
that he is with you, Lord,
that he is engaged.

37:09.931 --> 37:13.034
- Yes, it's...
- Oh, shit.

37:13.134 --> 37:15.236
- What? What?
- Oh, shit.

37:15.336 --> 37:16.537
Uh, Lord, we know...

37:16.637 --> 37:18.139
Why won't you keep your promise?

37:18.239 --> 37:19.941
- I'm trying.
- And help PJ

37:20.041 --> 37:21.609
- in this moment of need.
- Help me with

37:21.709 --> 37:22.911
- this blood here, will you?
- A destiny...

37:23.011 --> 37:24.879
What are you waiting for?

37:24.979 --> 37:27.181
I'm waiting for the cops
to find the guy who did it.

37:27.281 --> 37:29.150
Can I get some towels over here? Hurry!

37:29.250 --> 37:31.685
- And, yes, Lord!
- The stream of justice

37:31.820 --> 37:33.221
is winding but true.

37:33.321 --> 37:37.391
I cannot serve justice until
I understand who did it!

37:37.491 --> 37:40.194
Uh, be with us, Lord!
We know you have a plan.

37:40.294 --> 37:42.063
- Follow the stream.
- The glory of the Lord

37:42.163 --> 37:44.232
- rises upon you, PJ!
- Follow the stream.

37:44.332 --> 37:46.200
We see the darkness covers the earth,

37:46.300 --> 37:47.836
and... and we know that just because

37:47.936 --> 37:49.470
it's not working today doesn't mean

37:49.570 --> 37:51.505
it's not gonna work tomorrow,
and we're gonna...

37:51.605 --> 37:53.474
We're gonna get on our
hands and knees and pray.

37:53.574 --> 37:56.845
We know you healed the
sick and raised the dead.

37:56.878 --> 37:58.847
If you can bring Lazarus
back from the grave,

37:58.947 --> 38:00.681
you can surely wake PJ up.

38:00.849 --> 38:02.316
Please, wake him up now. Please!

38:02.416 --> 38:03.584
What's wrong?

38:03.684 --> 38:05.053
You're standing in the blood.

38:05.153 --> 38:07.521
You're standing in the blood!

38:07.621 --> 38:08.857
What blood?

38:29.477 --> 38:30.544
False alarm.

39:13.087 --> 39:15.323
Oh, Anne. Glad you could make it.

39:15.423 --> 39:17.825
Thank you. So where's the guest of honor?

39:17.926 --> 39:19.093
Oh, he's here, making his rounds.

39:19.193 --> 39:21.529
Great. Can't wait to see him.

39:21.629 --> 39:23.397
Mmm. Enjoy.

39:29.303 --> 39:33.174
Tonight, we honor a man who understands

39:33.274 --> 39:36.410
the important work we do as law enforcement,

39:36.510 --> 39:41.015
who rewards that work
by making sure criminals

39:41.115 --> 39:43.751
get the justice they deserve.

39:43.851 --> 39:45.219
No one will be mad

39:45.319 --> 39:47.588
if you're not in the mood to give a speech.

39:47.688 --> 39:51.192
Just get up there, say
thank you, and get off.

39:51.292 --> 39:53.928
It is with great pride that I award

39:54.028 --> 39:56.697
the Civilian's Badge of Merit

39:56.797 --> 40:01.035
to our friend Pernell Harris.

40:01.135 --> 40:02.603
Way to go, Your Honor.

40:13.614 --> 40:14.915
Oh.

40:15.016 --> 40:16.417
Nice.

40:21.322 --> 40:23.591
You deserve it.

40:25.059 --> 40:28.429
Thank you, John.

40:37.805 --> 40:39.207
As many of you know, um,

40:39.307 --> 40:42.310
my family is in the middle of a...

40:42.410 --> 40:46.014
very difficult time...

40:46.080 --> 40:49.717
And John even offered
to reschedule to give me

40:49.817 --> 40:52.153
the time to do what...

40:52.253 --> 40:55.489
whatever it is you do when...

40:55.589 --> 41:00.294
your son shoots himself
and is lying in a coma.

41:13.441 --> 41:17.311
But the more I thought about it,

41:17.411 --> 41:20.881
the more determined I was to be here,

41:21.049 --> 41:23.217
especially here,

41:23.317 --> 41:27.888
because you all deal with
tragedy all the time,

41:28.056 --> 41:30.158
and still you show up the next day,

41:30.258 --> 41:34.862
even on your worst day, to
put your lives on the line,

41:34.962 --> 41:37.298
because that is your job.

41:37.398 --> 41:39.367
So if you can do that,

41:39.467 --> 41:42.903
then I should be able
to muster the fortitude

41:43.071 --> 41:46.207
it takes to show up

41:46.307 --> 41:49.143
for some good music

41:49.243 --> 41:51.912
and some great food, and, uh,

41:52.080 --> 41:55.449
some shiny hardware.

41:59.553 --> 42:02.423
And this is not some five and dime tin star.

42:02.523 --> 42:04.092
This is the real thing.

42:04.125 --> 42:05.359
In fact, give me a set of cuffs,

42:05.459 --> 42:07.161
and I may arrest somebody on my way out.

42:07.261 --> 42:08.362
Or better yet,

42:08.462 --> 42:10.598
when I get home.

42:10.698 --> 42:11.832
You watch out, sweetie.

42:14.702 --> 42:18.106
My beautiful wife, ladies and gentlemen.

42:20.874 --> 42:22.376
Oh!

42:24.878 --> 42:26.747
Don't touch it!

42:31.785 --> 42:33.554
Nobody move.

42:36.157 --> 42:38.759
Nobody fuckin' move!

43:18.566 --> 43:21.835
What's your name?

43:21.935 --> 43:25.639
What is your name?

43:25.739 --> 43:27.275
Shane.

43:27.375 --> 43:29.543
Honey, let's go.

43:33.181 --> 43:34.882
Uh, let's have one more big hand for...

43:34.982 --> 43:39.720
- I'm following the stream.
- For Judge Pernell Harris.

43:39.820 --> 43:40.888
Pernell.

43:40.988 --> 43:42.623
Play something. Play something.

43:44.192 --> 43:48.696
Let's go home.

43:48.796 --> 43:50.030
Walk with me.

43:59.207 --> 44:01.509
Reverend Paul says I'm anointed.

44:05.279 --> 44:08.649
It happens when you're born again.

44:08.749 --> 44:11.319
God gives everyone gifts.

44:11.419 --> 44:14.199
For some the gifts are more
pronounced than for others.

44:15.289 --> 44:18.326
Depends on what God has planned for you.

44:18.426 --> 44:24.498
These voices that I'm hearing,
these visions that I'm seeing,

44:24.598 --> 44:26.700
they're real.

44:29.403 --> 44:31.372
God is speaking to me...

44:33.106 --> 44:34.442
through PJ.

44:36.344 --> 44:38.078
What is PJ...

44:38.246 --> 44:41.749
I mean God... telling you to do?

44:50.123 --> 44:52.360
Get the man who raped Jocelyn.

44:55.463 --> 44:57.331
I appreciate your flair for the dramatics,

44:57.431 --> 44:59.333
but this is going a bit far, Guy.

44:59.433 --> 45:01.269
It's not a show, Robert.
The key to this deal is gone.

45:01.335 --> 45:02.603
We have no choice but to cut our losses.

45:02.703 --> 45:04.171
Pernell is just part of the team.

45:04.272 --> 45:05.839
Remember, you got the mayor of San Vicente

45:05.939 --> 45:08.108
- standing right in front of you.
- You've been extremely helpful,

45:08.276 --> 45:09.477
but let's be honest, Pernell's the reason

45:09.577 --> 45:11.545
we got the land and the tax incentive.

45:11.645 --> 45:14.782
He's the reason we got to
build without union labor.

45:14.882 --> 45:16.784
Not he. We.

45:16.884 --> 45:19.287
I can get Pernell to do whatever
it is we need him to do.

45:19.387 --> 45:21.121
Just tell me. What's it gonna take

45:21.289 --> 45:23.457
to keep this deal on track?

45:23.557 --> 45:25.659
Well, let's start with something easy.

45:25.759 --> 45:27.761
Have him sign the eminent domain order

45:27.861 --> 45:29.563
- for the Vallco Drive.
- And if he does,

45:29.663 --> 45:32.500
you end negotiations with Fremont.

45:32.600 --> 45:37.004
No, but I'll put 'em on hold.

45:37.104 --> 45:38.972
It's as far as I can go.

45:45.579 --> 45:46.814
Shit.

45:46.914 --> 45:49.016
- Where's my signing pen?
- I'm sure it's at home.

45:49.116 --> 45:50.150
I had it this morning.

45:50.318 --> 45:51.385
Hey, here.

45:51.485 --> 45:54.322
I told Guy he could file this today.

46:00.994 --> 46:03.331
I can't do this right now.
My mind's not here.

46:03.364 --> 46:04.732
You don't need your mind.

46:04.832 --> 46:07.435
Just sign it. Please.

46:07.535 --> 46:10.404
The Brooks deal is riding on this, Pernell.

46:10.504 --> 46:12.940
I got this urge. Won't go away.

46:13.040 --> 46:16.176
It's like my dick just stays hard,

46:16.344 --> 46:17.978
but I don't need pussy.

46:18.078 --> 46:19.179
What do you need, Pernell?

46:19.347 --> 46:20.448
Please, tell me what the hell you need.

46:20.548 --> 46:21.949
I need justice for PJ.

46:22.049 --> 46:24.552
He shot himself.
There's no justice for that.

46:27.988 --> 46:30.424
I'm sorry, but somebody
had to put that out there.

46:33.961 --> 46:36.364
This all goes back to
when Jocelyn got raped.

46:36.464 --> 46:38.632
PJ's never been the same since,

46:38.732 --> 46:40.934
and not catching the rapist
only makes things worse.

46:41.034 --> 46:43.437
- They're gonna get the guy.
- I told 'em who it is!

46:43.537 --> 46:46.239
- The kid from the banquet?
- Shane Caldwell!

46:46.374 --> 46:47.741
I said, "Toby, go pick this kid up."

46:47.841 --> 46:50.844
- He won't do it.
- Give us a second.

46:52.179 --> 46:53.781
You're in crazy town, Pernell.

46:53.881 --> 46:55.416
If you talked to Toby, right?

46:55.516 --> 46:57.918
You say, "Toby, bring in
this Shane Caldwell,"

46:58.018 --> 47:00.253
I don't have to think
about this shit anymore.

47:00.388 --> 47:02.390
I could focus on other things.

47:04.858 --> 47:07.861
Are you holding this deal hostage?

47:07.961 --> 47:10.464
You know you got more to lose
in this than anybody, right?

47:10.564 --> 47:12.400
If Brooks Innovations pulls out,

47:12.466 --> 47:14.234
all that money you poured
into that land grab

47:14.402 --> 47:15.569
goes bye-bye.

47:15.669 --> 47:17.137
You think I give a shit about money?

47:17.237 --> 47:19.206
You should, and it's not just money.

47:19.306 --> 47:20.674
This is about legacy.

47:20.774 --> 47:22.843
I'm trying to secure our city's future.

47:22.943 --> 47:25.045
And I'm trying to get some fucking closure.

47:30.684 --> 47:32.553
You want me to arrest
an innocent man, a cop,

47:32.653 --> 47:34.221
just to make Pernell feel better?

47:34.321 --> 47:36.156
Don't arrest him. Just bring him in.

47:36.256 --> 47:38.191
Ask him a few questions. No harm, no foul.

47:38.291 --> 47:39.427
On what grounds?

47:39.493 --> 47:40.861
On the grounds that this whole city

47:40.961 --> 47:42.430
will come tumbling down if you don't.

47:42.530 --> 47:44.231
See what I mean?

47:44.331 --> 47:45.999
Just say you have an anonymous tip.

47:46.099 --> 47:48.536
Yeah, from a man who's
off his goddamn rocker.

47:48.636 --> 47:49.537
You should be getting Pernell help,

47:49.637 --> 47:51.439
not feeding his delusions.

47:51.472 --> 47:53.173
I'm not gonna put Shane
Caldwell through the wringer.

47:53.273 --> 47:54.808
He doesn't deserve it.

47:54.908 --> 47:56.810
You think I give a damn
about that cop's feelings?

47:56.910 --> 47:58.479
He is the microscopic speck of paint

47:58.579 --> 48:00.147
in a big picture I'm painting.

48:00.247 --> 48:02.550
You, you're just a teeny-tiny
bit bigger than the speck.

48:02.650 --> 48:04.818
Pernell, on the other hand,
is the fucking canvas,

48:04.918 --> 48:06.987
and without him, I have to start over.

48:07.087 --> 48:09.690
I'm too lazy to start over. You read me?

48:09.790 --> 48:12.726
Now I'm gonna keep this
in the form of a request,

48:12.826 --> 48:15.496
but the only fucking answer
I want to hear is yes.

48:15.596 --> 48:17.465
Will you please bring Shane Caldwell

48:17.531 --> 48:21.134
in for questioning?

48:23.103 --> 48:25.473
There's nothing to be nervous about, Shane.

48:25.573 --> 48:26.740
Just want to clear some things up.

48:26.840 --> 48:28.542
Am I gonna need somebody with me,

48:28.642 --> 48:30.678
- like, from the union?
- You're within your rights,

48:30.778 --> 48:32.680
but I think it's best if
we keep this unofficial.

48:32.780 --> 48:36.316
I'm thinking about your best
interests when I say that.

48:36.484 --> 48:39.386
What... what do you want to know?

48:39.487 --> 48:42.556
Where were you the night of April 17th?

48:42.656 --> 48:44.157
Um...

48:44.257 --> 48:45.659
That's like seven months ago.

48:45.759 --> 48:49.997
It's the night Jocelyn Harris was raped.

48:54.502 --> 48:56.804
That's what this is about?

48:56.904 --> 48:59.139
- I know this can't be easy.
- Don't get worked up, Shane.

48:59.239 --> 49:01.108
Just tell me if there's
anything familiar about him...

49:01.208 --> 49:03.310
Body movements, sound
of his voice, anything.

49:03.410 --> 49:04.878
Just gonna ask you a few questions

49:04.978 --> 49:06.747
- and let you get back to work.
- There's something.

49:06.847 --> 49:08.516
It's just I don't know what it is,

49:08.616 --> 49:10.651
- but there's something about him.
- What did I tell you?

49:10.751 --> 49:12.920
I knew it! You think I raped somebody?

49:13.020 --> 49:14.722
Nobody's accusing you of anything.

49:14.822 --> 49:16.323
I just want to know where you were.

49:16.423 --> 49:18.959
I was at work, chief.

49:19.059 --> 49:20.728
Swing shift.

49:20.828 --> 49:22.329
I was on a vandalism report

49:22.429 --> 49:24.131
when the 2-6-1 came over the radio.

49:24.231 --> 49:28.335
I offered to respond, and
I was told to stand by.

49:28.435 --> 49:30.604
Later that night, dispatch called

49:30.704 --> 49:33.541
and asked me to do a courtesy visit.

49:33.641 --> 49:34.908
I spent the rest of my shift

49:35.008 --> 49:38.411
parked outside the victim's house.

49:38.512 --> 49:40.047
Shit.

49:44.117 --> 49:47.588
Yeah, I couldn't sleep until he got there.

49:47.688 --> 49:49.757
He would shine a light through the window

49:49.857 --> 49:51.525
every half an hour so just to let me know

49:51.625 --> 49:53.761
that he was still there.

49:53.861 --> 49:58.131
He's the reason I made it
through that first night.

50:08.876 --> 50:10.778
But you got to understand, I'm not wrong.

50:10.878 --> 50:12.445
- I know it was him.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

50:12.546 --> 50:13.647
He was working. He couldn't have done it.

50:13.747 --> 50:15.215
That's just an alibi.

50:20.688 --> 50:22.089
You could set the time
and the date on the camera

50:22.189 --> 50:23.256
to whatever you want.

50:23.356 --> 50:24.958
Every cruiser has a transponder.

50:25.058 --> 50:27.527
His time and location's confirmed by GPS,

50:27.628 --> 50:28.962
unless you think the goddamn satellites

50:29.062 --> 50:30.798
- are lying to us too.
- We're done here.

50:30.898 --> 50:33.524
- No, we're not.
- Pernell, what more do you want?

50:41.041 --> 50:43.276
No fuckin' way.

50:43.376 --> 50:45.879
I want to talk to my rep.

50:51.985 --> 50:54.988
You're supposed to make
sergeant next month, right?

50:55.088 --> 50:57.725
Nothing that's happened here changes that,

50:57.825 --> 51:01.962
but the second I call your
rep, this becomes official.

51:02.062 --> 51:06.199
Shane Caldwell was questioned
in connection to a rape.

51:06.299 --> 51:07.701
It'll be in writing,

51:07.801 --> 51:12.640
and your future will go
backwards very quickly.

51:12.673 --> 51:16.844
Now, are you sure you
want me to make that call?

51:35.362 --> 51:38.365
I need you to stand up

51:38.465 --> 51:40.934
and approach the glass.

52:13.901 --> 52:16.469
What's he doing?

52:16.569 --> 52:18.571
What's he doing?

52:18.706 --> 52:20.774
He was wearing a mask,

52:20.874 --> 52:22.109
but you saw his privates, didn't you?

52:22.209 --> 52:24.411
That's the one thing

52:24.511 --> 52:25.512
- you had to have seen.
- Oh, my...

52:25.612 --> 52:26.714
- Come on, come on.
- No.

52:26.814 --> 52:28.749
- Just take a quick look.
- No!

52:28.849 --> 52:32.052
There's got to be something you recognize.

52:38.826 --> 52:41.094
I need you to lift your shirt, please.

52:41.194 --> 52:43.196
We need to see.

52:53.741 --> 52:56.243
That man raped you.

52:56.343 --> 52:57.577
He raped you!

52:57.745 --> 52:59.246
And he made PJ watch!

52:59.346 --> 53:01.014
Now you look at him!

53:01.114 --> 53:02.515
Let go of me. Please let go of me!

53:02.615 --> 53:03.917
He needs to face justice for what he did!

53:04.017 --> 53:05.285
Look at him. Look at him!

53:05.385 --> 53:07.220
Look!

53:07.320 --> 53:09.156
I need to know.

53:11.959 --> 53:15.328
Help me, Jocelyn.

53:15.428 --> 53:16.997
Help PJ.

53:28.776 --> 53:31.578
There are pieces of that night

53:31.678 --> 53:34.414
that I've been able to forget.

53:37.617 --> 53:40.253
Not a lot.

53:40.353 --> 53:42.489
Not enough.

53:42.589 --> 53:47.660
But there are some pieces
that I just don't remember.

53:47.795 --> 53:49.797
What the penis on the man

53:49.863 --> 53:53.801
who raped me for an hour
in front of my husband

53:53.867 --> 53:55.202
looks like

53:55.302 --> 53:59.840
is one of those things I don't remember,

53:59.940 --> 54:01.809
and I will do everything within my power

54:01.909 --> 54:04.511
to keep it that way.

54:04.611 --> 54:06.179
Does that help?

54:16.824 --> 54:18.992
We're done, Shane. I'm sorry.

54:33.974 --> 54:35.442
Sign the fuckin' order.

55:05.238 --> 55:09.242
Brother Harris, what's on your mind?

55:09.342 --> 55:12.179
I think God's vision was wrong.

55:12.279 --> 55:13.881
His vision's never wrong. He's God.

55:13.947 --> 55:17.150
Are you sure?

55:17.250 --> 55:21.154
Because everyone I know thinks I'm crazy,

55:21.254 --> 55:23.991
and I'm startin' to wonder myself.

55:24.091 --> 55:26.960
Well, that'd be in the
same company as Moses,

55:27.060 --> 55:31.331
John the baptist, and Jesus himself.

55:31.431 --> 55:34.167
So...

55:34.267 --> 55:38.138
You don't think he could
just be fuckin' with me?

55:38.238 --> 55:39.539
You know, like a test?

55:39.639 --> 55:41.441
God doesn't test his children.

55:41.541 --> 55:43.343
The devil does.

55:44.744 --> 55:48.315
You see, God gives you free will

55:48.415 --> 55:50.817
so you can prove your
faith by believing in him

55:50.918 --> 55:52.953
during times of trial.

55:53.053 --> 55:54.922
And the devil saves his best tricks

55:55.022 --> 55:57.790
for God's anointed ones.

55:57.925 --> 55:59.159
If you're being tested,

55:59.259 --> 56:01.361
that means you're on the right track.

56:21.548 --> 56:23.083
You got a minute?

56:26.219 --> 56:27.620
Yeah.

56:35.695 --> 56:38.065
Stayin' out of trouble?

56:38.165 --> 56:40.600
Yes, sir. Praise God.

56:43.536 --> 56:46.806
I wasn't gonna say this in court, but, uh,

56:46.974 --> 56:50.843
you were right about what you said.

56:50.978 --> 56:54.447
God chose me to mete out justice.

56:54.547 --> 56:57.384
Just like Solomon.

56:57.484 --> 56:59.619
I knew it.

56:59.719 --> 57:01.221
I knew it.

57:02.990 --> 57:05.192
But I can't do it alone.

57:07.660 --> 57:09.462
Solomon had this guy, Benayah.

57:09.562 --> 57:10.897
Benaiah.

57:10.998 --> 57:14.067
That was one bad ass motherfucker.

57:18.071 --> 57:21.574
You want to know what else God told me?

57:25.012 --> 57:28.481
He wants you...

57:28.581 --> 57:30.717
To be my Benaiah.

57:33.453 --> 57:35.722
I can do that.

57:38.025 --> 57:40.193
Where you been?

57:41.861 --> 57:43.530
Bible study.

57:46.599 --> 57:48.901
Jocelyn called.

57:49.036 --> 57:52.039
She's turning off the machine tomorrow.

57:52.139 --> 57:54.107
You can't come.

57:54.207 --> 57:57.477
You're not allowed anywhere near her.

58:03.116 --> 58:06.153
- All I did was...
- Oh, I heard what you did.

58:06.253 --> 58:08.221
I'm surprised she didn't
commit suicide herself.

58:08.321 --> 58:09.789
I'm keeping my promise to PJ.

58:09.889 --> 58:12.325
Stop saying that.

58:12.425 --> 58:15.962
Whatever it is you
wanted to do it for him...

58:16.063 --> 58:19.299
You should have done it while he was alive.

58:21.701 --> 58:24.304
He is alive.

58:29.809 --> 58:31.111
Whoo!

58:31.211 --> 58:32.912
Make a bunch! Make a bunch!

58:33.080 --> 58:33.913
Make a bunch!

58:34.081 --> 58:35.615
As many as you can.

58:35.715 --> 58:36.783
Come on. Go straight back.

58:36.883 --> 58:38.351

What the hell are you doing here?

01:00:26.659 --> 01:00:28.795
I told you that he wasn't allowed in here.

01:00:28.895 --> 01:00:30.096
- It's not up to her.
- What?

01:00:30.197 --> 01:00:31.464
This is a 48-hour stay of the court,

01:00:31.564 --> 01:00:33.166
during which time you're required to keep

01:00:33.266 --> 01:00:35.435
Pernell Harris Junior
connected to a ventilator

01:00:35.535 --> 01:00:38.738
and take all necessary
measures to keep him alive.

01:00:38.838 --> 01:00:40.673
He's already dead.

Why? Why?

01:00:49.982 --> 01:00:50.917
Why? Why?

01:00:51.017 --> 01:00:53.453

What you're describing is
called an acute stress reaction.

01:01:20.647 --> 01:01:23.350
It's a common reaction to traumatic events.

01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:26.519
The more extreme the event,
the more extreme the reaction.

01:01:26.619 --> 01:01:28.255
Praise God!

01:01:28.288 --> 01:01:32.024
Praise God! Praise God!

01:01:32.124 --> 01:01:34.661
God worked a miracle today!

01:01:34.761 --> 01:01:36.763
Yes, he did.

01:01:38.798 --> 01:01:41.768
Literally reached down

01:01:41.868 --> 01:01:44.003
and made his will be done.

01:01:44.103 --> 01:01:45.872
That's right.

01:01:45.972 --> 01:01:48.040
And he used this man to do it.

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:49.976
In some cases, a person's reality

01:01:50.076 --> 01:01:51.511
can actually be altered.

01:01:51.611 --> 01:01:54.080
It's easier than you think for imagination

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.782
to become hallucination.

01:01:55.882 --> 01:01:57.884
Come on up, brother Pernell!

01:01:57.984 --> 01:02:01.087
You testify! Testify!

01:02:01.187 --> 01:02:02.489
Tell them your story.

01:02:02.589 --> 01:02:06.158
Tell them your story. Thank you, Jesus!

01:02:12.699 --> 01:02:16.002
I don't know exactly what to say,

01:02:16.102 --> 01:02:18.305
except, um...

01:02:19.539 --> 01:02:22.008
God just taught me the miracle of life.

01:02:25.612 --> 01:02:27.714
Of course he thinks they're real.

01:02:27.814 --> 01:02:31.150
The hallucinations activate
the same perceptual systems

01:02:31.318 --> 01:02:32.652
of the brain as reality.

01:02:32.752 --> 01:02:34.754
Please, just tell me there's a pill.

01:02:34.854 --> 01:02:37.490
I'm not a good man.

01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:39.359
I drink, I whore, I lie.

01:02:39.459 --> 01:02:40.760
We're all sinners saved by grace.

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:42.395
Amen.

01:02:42.495 --> 01:02:47.834
Before last week, I was
only in church two times.

01:02:47.934 --> 01:02:51.338
One for my wedding...

01:02:51.371 --> 01:02:53.340
And one for my mother's funeral.

01:02:53.406 --> 01:02:55.808
That's okay. Jesus loves you.

01:02:55.908 --> 01:02:56.843
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:02:56.943 --> 01:02:58.678
Yes, he does. Amen.

01:02:58.778 --> 01:03:00.513
Medication won't be nearly enough.

01:03:00.613 --> 01:03:04.951
He needs to be treated by a
professional in a hospital.

01:03:07.487 --> 01:03:09.722
I didn't rape that girl.

01:03:09.822 --> 01:03:13.225
I didn't rape anybody. I swear to God.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:14.994
Stop lying, Shane.

01:03:15.094 --> 01:03:18.831
I know the truth.

01:03:18.931 --> 01:03:20.400
You raped that woman,

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:22.268
and now God wants you struck down.

01:03:22.369 --> 01:03:24.771
No! God would never tell anybody

01:03:24.871 --> 01:03:26.873
to kill somebody.

01:03:26.973 --> 01:03:28.575
God is love.

01:03:28.675 --> 01:03:33.780
Well, you got to brush up
on your Bible studies, boy.

01:03:36.248 --> 01:03:38.050
"Rejoice with him, o, heavens;

01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:40.219
"Bow down to him, all gods,

01:03:40.387 --> 01:03:42.422
"For he avenges the
blood of his children,

01:03:42.522 --> 01:03:44.023
and takes vengeance on
his adversaries."

01:03:44.123 --> 01:03:47.527
- Wait, please...
- He repays those who hate him.

01:03:47.627 --> 01:03:49.429
Just listen to me... God, please!

01:03:49.529 --> 01:03:50.863
And cleanses his people's land.

01:03:50.963 --> 01:03:51.964
Aah!

01:04:02.909 --> 01:04:05.678
I don't know the Bible like I should.

01:04:05.778 --> 01:04:07.947
I don't even know the Lord's prayer.

01:04:08.047 --> 01:04:09.982
God sees your heart.

01:04:10.082 --> 01:04:11.851
But I do know this.

01:04:11.951 --> 01:04:13.420
- God called.
- Yes.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.188
- Praise Jesus.
- Amen.

01:04:16.288 --> 01:04:17.924
And I answered.

01:04:18.024 --> 01:04:20.893
Amen! Praise God!

01:04:22.429 --> 01:04:24.296
Hallelujah! Amen!

01:04:24.431 --> 01:04:27.133
You can still go to heaven, Shane.

01:04:27.233 --> 01:04:28.835
Do you want to?

01:04:36.075 --> 01:04:37.644
Yeah.

01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:48.688
Do you accept Jesus as your lord and savior?

01:04:48.788 --> 01:04:49.956
Okay.

01:04:50.056 --> 01:04:51.357
Say "I do."

01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:52.592
I do.

01:04:52.692 --> 01:04:57.497
Say "Dear Lord,
please forgive me."

01:04:57.597 --> 01:04:58.998
- Jesus!
- Saves!

01:04:59.098 --> 01:05:00.299
- Jesus!
- Saves!

01:05:00.467 --> 01:05:02.835
- Jesus!
- Saves!

01:05:06.238 --> 01:05:12.078
Dear Lord, please forgive me.

01:05:12.178 --> 01:05:15.982
They made me rape her.

01:05:16.082 --> 01:05:18.184
What did you say?

01:05:18.284 --> 01:05:20.553
I just wanted to get the book,

01:05:20.653 --> 01:05:23.590
but they said that I had to rape her.

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:26.325
- Who's they?
- I had to do it that way.

01:05:26.493 --> 01:05:30.296
- Who's they?
- Dear Lord...

01:05:30.396 --> 01:05:32.665
Please forgive me.

01:05:32.765 --> 01:05:34.801
No. Who's they?

01:05:34.901 --> 01:05:37.103
Who made you?

01:05:37.203 --> 01:05:38.270
Who made you, Shane?

01:05:38.505 --> 01:05:40.673
Who's they?
