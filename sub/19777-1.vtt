Object approaching Xircon Relm.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.502
Oh, my God!

02:23.143 --> 02:25.211
Object transferred.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.947
Location Unknown.

02:39.325 --> 02:43.095
We both know what was in that box.
What we don't know

02:43.096 --> 02:44.596
where it is.

02:44.597 --> 02:47.099
- Sir, I'm very sorry, I...
- Find it!

02:47.100 --> 02:50.636
Yes, sir.

02:50.637 --> 02:53.540
The box people! The box!

02:56.075 --> 02:57.477
Your ball, doormat.

03:02.649 --> 03:03.849
Let's play zone.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.451
That's for defense, dummy.

03:06.886 --> 03:08.320
Matt, just gimme the ball.

03:08.321 --> 03:10.956
Cover it through Bryce.
Knock him on his butt.

03:10.957 --> 03:13.258
No! That's what he expects.

03:13.259 --> 03:14.961
We need the element of surprise.

03:16.162 --> 03:18.163
Boomer.

03:18.164 --> 03:20.832
Surprise? That's more
like a catastrophe.

03:20.833 --> 03:22.000
I can't shoot.

03:22.001 --> 03:24.636
Okay, let's just use, "L.S."

03:24.637 --> 03:28.707
Right, your famous logical
strategy app that never works.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.009
If we put in all the
data on Bryce's team,

03:31.010 --> 03:32.344
this will tell us how to win.

03:32.345 --> 03:33.946
What's logical strategy anyway?

03:33.947 --> 03:36.516
Well, that's just a way of thinking
that I turned into an app.

03:37.617 --> 03:38.850
There.

03:38.851 --> 03:41.820
Okay Mr. I.T., what does it say?

03:41.821 --> 03:43.355
Find four better players.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.892
All right come on, zeros,
we don't have all day.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.394
- Ready?
- Break.

03:52.765 --> 03:53.933
Way to go, Bryce.

04:02.275 --> 04:03.675
Boomer, keep the shot.

04:03.676 --> 04:05.278
Shoot, you can do it.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.357
Come on, Bryce. Way to go.

04:19.591 --> 04:22.928
Sorry Matt, I guess
I blew it again.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.062
Don't worry about it.

04:24.063 --> 04:26.298
Eighteen to zero.

04:26.299 --> 04:28.100
He was fouled and you know it.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.435
No. That's not a foul.

04:31.170 --> 04:32.804
That's a foul.

04:32.805 --> 04:34.273
You're such a jerk, Bryce.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.842
Why don't yo pick on someone
with your same size.

04:36.843 --> 04:38.110
That could be hard to find.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.379
So, try me.

04:40.313 --> 04:42.815
Your daddy drank away all
your family's money.

04:49.522 --> 04:52.557
Okay, okay, okay. I give.

04:52.558 --> 04:54.793
We're all really sorry
you have to move.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.462
We're gonna miss
having a re-match.

04:58.231 --> 05:01.334
Your dad was smart. He
left a long time ago.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.837
Why do I hate that guy so much?

05:05.838 --> 05:07.339
'Cause he's a jerk.

05:07.340 --> 05:10.042
Mel, that was a
rhetorical question.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.176
What's rhetorical?

05:11.177 --> 05:13.178
Let's just get the ball and go.

05:13.179 --> 05:15.548
Oh! It's right under Jenny.

05:16.916 --> 05:19.651
Matt, now's your chance
to go and talk to her.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.921
Gimme a break. He's never
said one word to her.

05:22.922 --> 05:24.423
And why would he?

05:24.424 --> 05:26.358
She's one of Bryce's girls.

05:26.359 --> 05:27.794
No, she's not.

05:28.394 --> 05:29.896
She's different.

05:31.130 --> 05:32.764
Oh, I touched a nerve.

05:32.765 --> 05:35.902
If she's so different, why
don't you go get the ball.

05:37.870 --> 05:39.038
That's what I thought.

05:46.045 --> 05:49.682
I swear, before I leave, I'm gonna
pound Bryce into the ground.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.384
Watch this.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.453
Hiya!

05:54.454 --> 05:55.988
I call that move shock.

05:56.322 --> 05:57.589
And awe.

05:57.590 --> 05:59.959
It needs more shock and a
little less awe. Okay?

06:03.463 --> 06:05.997
Could this be any uglier?

06:05.998 --> 06:09.267
The park looks pretty epic.
There's even the rock wall.

06:09.268 --> 06:11.236
Yeah, right where my house is.

06:11.237 --> 06:13.138
Mine's where that
huge building is.

06:13.139 --> 06:15.775
Hey look, they added a QR code.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.113
Hi, I'm, Billy Weller and

06:21.114 --> 06:24.549
this is Xircon Corporation's
investment in your future.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.551
It's pretty cool, right?

06:26.552 --> 06:31.556
Xircon Plaza will provide hundred's of
jobs and a big boost to your economy.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.592
But those changes are
just the beginning.

06:33.593 --> 06:38.463
With the new technologies I'm developing,
changing America won't be far off.

06:38.464 --> 06:40.500
Xircon. Here today,

06:41.134 --> 06:42.702
for your better tomorrow.

06:47.774 --> 06:49.708
Well, it's not gonna happen.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.382
Because in two days
when the council votes,

06:51.394 --> 06:53.078
our parents are gonna
be there to stop it.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.312
Get real, Bauer.

06:54.313 --> 06:55.881
Money talks.

06:55.882 --> 06:59.117
Bryce and his daddy's pals have
a lot more influence than us.

06:59.118 --> 07:01.052
We'll see about that.

07:01.053 --> 07:03.055
This is my home.
I'm not leaving.

07:04.223 --> 07:06.426
Lies. Bunch of lies.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.162
He's bringing "The Shadow" here.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.564
What are you talking about?

07:12.198 --> 07:13.432
It's the Pandora Project.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.835
Look, it's right
there, plain as day.

07:17.570 --> 07:19.237
What's he talking about?

07:19.238 --> 07:20.673
I don't see anything.

07:21.808 --> 07:23.743
- Where's that...
- That was weird.

07:24.777 --> 07:25.944
Who was that?

07:25.945 --> 07:28.313
- Just a looser.
- What was he saying?

07:28.314 --> 07:29.581
Who knows.

07:29.582 --> 07:30.917
Let's just go to the cabin.

07:45.331 --> 07:49.201
Maybe it's better we move, start over
somewhere where no one knows us.

07:49.202 --> 07:52.904
I hate change and my therapist
says it's terrible for my OCD.

07:52.905 --> 07:55.640
They can't break up our group.
You guys are my best friends.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.977
You think they'll still let
us play and the rock wall?

08:15.962 --> 08:19.064
Come on, Boomer, this could be your
last chance to finally make it over.

08:19.065 --> 08:20.365
Without getting wet.

08:20.366 --> 08:21.900
Want me to help you?

08:21.901 --> 08:24.469
No, I'll do it. I'll do it.
You guys just,

08:24.470 --> 08:26.105
go ahead, I'll catch up.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.053
Okay.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.655
Use L.S.

08:47.126 --> 08:49.228
Climb between rocks.

08:50.062 --> 08:51.197
Between rocks.

09:02.241 --> 09:03.441
You okay?

09:03.442 --> 09:06.077
Actually yeah, I barely
felt my aqua-phobia.

09:06.078 --> 09:08.680
You're a walking
disaster, you know that?

09:08.681 --> 09:10.650
It's not my fault
the rock moved.

09:11.317 --> 09:12.450
That's not a rock.

09:12.451 --> 09:13.920
Whoa, what is that?

09:26.365 --> 09:28.099
- Dope.
- Wow.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.168
We're in trouble.

09:31.470 --> 09:32.837
Shadow?

09:32.838 --> 09:34.574
Isn't that what the
homeless guy said?

09:36.175 --> 09:37.242
U.S. Military?

09:37.243 --> 09:38.578
You know what's probably inside?

09:39.312 --> 09:40.412
Guns!

09:40.413 --> 09:42.247
We're really in trouble.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.748
Let's take it to the cabin.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.417
We can't just take it.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.920
Eddie, are you crazy? There
could be explosives in there.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.656
Grenades, weapons
grade plutonium.

09:51.657 --> 09:53.292
We're definitely taking it.

09:56.228 --> 09:57.729
These are plans for something.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.365
Why would they be out here?

10:00.366 --> 10:01.901
There's only one
way to find out.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.202
It's still not moving.

10:04.203 --> 10:08.373
Make sure to get something that
will pry it open or something.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.408
- Hand me that pipe.
- Let me try.

10:10.409 --> 10:11.509
Try the other latch.

10:11.510 --> 10:12.677
- No, no, no.
- Come on!

10:12.678 --> 10:14.446
Okay, move your slimy fingers.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.648
Just... no, not that, there.

10:16.649 --> 10:18.550
Maybe we can pick it?

10:18.551 --> 10:20.485
How? There's no place for a key.

10:20.486 --> 10:21.787
Stand back.

10:23.689 --> 10:25.557
Okay, yeah, like that's
really gonna work.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.431
- Okay, so we tried
everything except

10:27.443 --> 10:29.327
use L.S. -

10:29.328 --> 10:31.130
I knew Mel could it.

10:41.073 --> 10:43.242
SG 8000.

10:44.176 --> 10:45.910
Toy Gue-Gun?

10:45.911 --> 10:47.412
It's definitely our plans.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.714
More like toys.

10:49.715 --> 10:52.350
What's he gonna be doing
with a bunch of toys?

10:52.351 --> 10:53.719
That don't even work.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.288
Cool!

11:01.661 --> 11:04.063
Ugh. I feel weird.

11:05.631 --> 11:07.298
Hey, look at these.

11:07.299 --> 11:10.169
Try it on. They've got to
help you better than yours.

11:13.439 --> 11:14.774
Matt. Catch.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.912
Way too big.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.814
Here.

11:23.616 --> 11:24.950
How do I look?

11:25.618 --> 11:27.986
Like Mel, with a hat.

11:27.987 --> 11:30.355
Yeah, the arch, it's a tad low.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.425
Boomer, this isn't a shoe store.

11:34.126 --> 11:35.227
That's everything.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.962
These are lame.

11:37.963 --> 11:40.398
The military can have mine back.

11:40.399 --> 11:41.934
- Me too.
- Yeah.

11:58.651 --> 12:01.519
Hey, Matt. I need your opinion.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.022
Are these two on the nose?

12:04.323 --> 12:06.257
No. It's fine.

12:06.258 --> 12:09.762
Okay, good, 'cause I'm gonna make 20
more of these for the rally tomorrow.

12:11.263 --> 12:12.998
- Hey, mom.
- Yeah?

12:14.166 --> 12:16.202
Do you think we can
actually stop it?

12:17.136 --> 12:18.536
We've got to try.

12:18.537 --> 12:21.272
You know, it's not just our
homes, it's the wet lands too.

12:21.273 --> 12:24.043
We can't just let them come in here
and ruin the local environment.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.248
Okay. I know that look.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.252
- What's wrong?
- It's just...

12:33.886 --> 12:35.154
What if we move out of town,

12:36.322 --> 12:37.790
will dad ever visit us?

12:38.691 --> 12:40.425
Um...

12:40.426 --> 12:43.195
I don't know. I hope so.

12:45.297 --> 12:47.399
Why'd he leave us for
that other family?

12:48.033 --> 12:49.934
Weren't we good enough?

12:49.935 --> 12:53.906
Matt. We're better than good enough.
Okay?

12:54.807 --> 12:56.708
Now, listen...

12:56.709 --> 12:58.377
Lights out in ten minutes.
I mean it.

13:58.537 --> 13:59.605
Help!

14:00.606 --> 14:03.007
Matt, what happened?

14:03.008 --> 14:05.343
What are you talking about?
My face...

14:05.344 --> 14:06.545
Your face is fine.

14:10.382 --> 14:11.483
Are you okay?

14:12.351 --> 14:13.385
Yeah.

14:14.453 --> 14:15.554
Sorry.

14:19.258 --> 14:20.391
- Sick.
- Whoa.

14:20.392 --> 14:21.594
Awesome.

14:23.295 --> 14:25.196
How did you do that?

14:25.197 --> 14:28.033
Any face I look at,
I turn into it.

14:31.437 --> 14:32.937
Wow.

14:32.938 --> 14:36.908
You see, there's two sensors, touch
them both and it completes the circuit.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.510
I bet the other
toys have them too.

15:08.974 --> 15:11.242
I don't see any sensors.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.479
Boomer, can you give me a
flashlight from the kitchen?

15:17.383 --> 15:20.052
- Whoa, did you just see that?
- What?

15:26.125 --> 15:28.726
The front leg of a right
triangle is 18 cms,

15:28.727 --> 15:31.195
and it's area is 108 sq cms.

15:31.196 --> 15:33.999
It's perimeter is 51.6 cms.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.701
Did I just say that?

15:36.702 --> 15:38.037
Here's something.

15:44.410 --> 15:45.477
That...

15:46.111 --> 15:47.212
was...

15:47.546 --> 15:49.547
awesome!

15:49.548 --> 15:50.950
Did you guys find any sensors?

15:51.250 --> 15:52.518
Yes!

incredible simulation.

16:35.127 --> 16:37.997
- Help. Help. Help. Help. Help.
- Right here.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.403
Are these the coolest
toys ever or what?

16:47.072 --> 16:48.439
I bet these are secret weapons.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.709
What? Is the army going to
amuse the enemy to death?

16:51.710 --> 16:55.046
Yeah. And there isn't an
army base within 100 miles.

16:55.047 --> 16:56.681
Maybe it's from a toy company.

16:56.682 --> 16:59.084
Have you ever seen toys
that can do all this?

17:01.720 --> 17:04.989
There's like a mini computer
in here, in electrodes.

17:04.990 --> 17:06.723
Look at this tiny battery.

17:06.724 --> 17:08.426
How can these
things do all this?

17:09.728 --> 17:11.195
Maybe this ball is the answer.

17:11.630 --> 17:13.064
Who cares?

17:13.065 --> 17:14.866
The real question is

17:14.867 --> 17:16.334
what are we gonna do with them?

17:16.335 --> 17:19.871
Something tells me you already
know the answer to that.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.006
Silly wilding. Wonder
what this does?

17:23.876 --> 17:25.676
No, no, no, no, no, no.

17:28.446 --> 17:30.348
What'd you do to me?

17:34.119 --> 17:35.420
Oh my god!

17:35.421 --> 17:37.623
I feel amazing, let's
clean this cabin.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.744
It was here.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.221
All right zeros...

18:10.222 --> 18:13.525
you wanted a re-match, we're
not waiting for Bauer.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.310
Oh, man...

18:32.311 --> 18:34.446
- Lucky shot.
- Yeah.

18:35.547 --> 18:36.782
Your last.

19:03.742 --> 19:06.245
This is gonna be fun.

19:32.171 --> 19:37.242

19:40.746 --> 19:41.914
Wow.

19:57.429 --> 19:59.731
- Where's the payload?

Not by a long shot.

21:28.587 --> 21:31.522
Guys... You've got to see this.

21:31.523 --> 21:33.858
Matt, you just missed the show.

21:33.859 --> 21:35.027
Wait till you see mine.

21:35.560 --> 21:36.662
Come on.

21:47.105 --> 21:48.540
Cool.

21:48.807 --> 21:49.974
Wow.

21:52.844 --> 21:54.612
- Wow.
- Crazy.

21:54.613 --> 21:55.780
Awesome.

21:55.781 --> 21:58.449
Someone should tell Mark
Zuckerberg about this.

21:58.450 --> 22:01.285
Welcome to Holopedia, 7.0.

22:01.286 --> 22:02.821
Updated every year.

22:03.488 --> 22:06.024
Wait, that's 25 years from now.

22:06.358 --> 22:07.591
Oh, I get it.

22:07.592 --> 22:10.027
This thing predicts the future.

22:10.028 --> 22:12.930
No, no, no. This is the future.

22:12.931 --> 22:14.032
Watch this.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.233
Search Xircon Plaza.

22:16.234 --> 22:17.769
But that hasn't been built yet?

22:18.136 --> 22:20.037
Yes, it has.

22:20.038 --> 22:21.806
What's that supposed to be?

22:21.807 --> 22:24.408
That's what Weller's
gonna do to our homes?

22:24.409 --> 22:25.743
Here's goes the neighborhood.

22:25.744 --> 22:27.778
That's not what's
on the billboard.

22:27.779 --> 22:30.147
Exactly. It's just like
the homeless guy said.

22:30.148 --> 22:33.384
Weller's lying about all of this.
We have to get this to the police.

22:33.385 --> 22:38.656
Come on, you're expecting us to believe
this ball thing is from the future?

22:38.657 --> 22:40.524
Of course, all the toys are.

22:40.525 --> 22:43.127
How else do you explain stuff
like a holographic Wikipedia.

22:43.128 --> 22:46.263
Holograms are images produced
by waves for reconstruction

22:46.264 --> 22:48.934
using lasers to record
the defraction pattern.

22:49.768 --> 22:51.736
Then how else do
you explain that?

22:51.737 --> 22:55.673
You're saying the army is
experimenting in time travel?

22:55.674 --> 22:58.075
- Someone is.
- No. No way.

22:58.076 --> 23:00.845
This is just some high-tech
game, that's all.

23:00.846 --> 23:04.015
Okay, there's only one way to prove
is this is really from the future.

23:05.150 --> 23:06.784
Search tomorrow's news.

23:06.785 --> 23:08.853
Use current location and date?

23:08.854 --> 23:12.491
Use current location,
but tomorrow's date.

23:14.926 --> 23:18.929
What did I say? That's our
local newspaper from tomorrow.

23:18.930 --> 23:22.166
Okay, excuse me while I'm
having an anxiety attack.

23:22.167 --> 23:26.437
What? Oh, man. Xircon Plaza
is actually gonna happen.

23:26.438 --> 23:28.606
We're gonna loose
our homes for sure.

23:28.607 --> 23:31.743
Uh, guys, there's
something else.

23:33.912 --> 23:34.979
Wait a minute.

23:34.980 --> 23:36.114
That's us!

23:37.015 --> 23:38.483
Missing?

23:40.919 --> 23:42.053
Someone's coming.

24:03.008 --> 24:04.109
All right.

24:06.144 --> 24:07.479
Come on.

24:19.691 --> 24:21.192
- Are they gone?
- Yeah, for good.

24:21.193 --> 24:22.527
- All clear.
- Come on.

24:25.163 --> 24:26.430
Who are they?

24:26.431 --> 24:28.232
I hope they're janitors.

24:28.233 --> 24:30.801
Janitors don't wear black suits.

24:30.802 --> 24:34.071
If this thing's right, those
guys could be looking for us.

24:34.072 --> 24:37.909
If this thing's right,
it could be a lot worse.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.743
Right.

24:39.744 --> 24:42.214
Let's split up. Meet at
the bikes in 15 minutes.

24:52.357 --> 24:54.259
Go, go, go, go, go.

25:24.523 --> 25:28.526
If we don't find those boys and those plans
before the meeting tonight happens Joe,

25:28.527 --> 25:30.929
he's gonna be very unhappy.
Come on.

25:41.740 --> 25:44.341
Uh. Oh. Sorry. Sorry.

25:44.342 --> 25:45.710
No. It is my fault.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.113
- Jenny?
- Yes.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.181
Do I know you?

25:53.084 --> 25:54.786
Um, no.

25:55.854 --> 25:58.289
No, I've seen you at school.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.658
You must be new.

26:00.125 --> 26:04.729
Has anyone every told you, you
look just like Justin Prince?

26:05.997 --> 26:07.498
Yeah. All the time.

26:07.499 --> 26:12.937
Quantum Theory today, Wormholes
in Space, Catcher in the Rye...

26:12.938 --> 26:14.605
Think I've read most of these.

26:14.606 --> 26:18.542
You have? Boys around here,
only read Instagram posts.

26:18.543 --> 26:20.678
Catcher in the Rye is
my all time favorite.

26:20.679 --> 26:23.315
Really? That was my dad's too.

26:23.982 --> 26:25.616
It was?

26:25.617 --> 26:27.918
He passed away a
couple of years ago.

26:27.919 --> 26:31.188
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

26:31.189 --> 26:33.657
I'm living with my
gross step-father now.

26:33.658 --> 26:35.693
Can't stand him.

26:35.694 --> 26:38.196
So if you're not just in
Prince, what's your name?

26:41.466 --> 26:43.001
It's Holden.

26:44.636 --> 26:46.070
That's amazing.

26:46.071 --> 26:47.638
Just like in the book.

26:47.639 --> 26:49.273
I'm Jenny Johnstone.

26:49.274 --> 26:52.811
I'm sorry about knocking into you.
Will you forgive me?

26:53.778 --> 26:56.547
Sure, I think I
could manage that.

27:00.752 --> 27:02.954
Sorry, just some
guy from school.

27:03.254 --> 27:04.455
Bryce.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.324
He's asking if I
wanna see him later.

27:06.858 --> 27:08.292
And?

27:08.293 --> 27:11.262
Are you kidding, that guy's about as
interesting as watching hair grow.

27:12.564 --> 27:14.766
Okay. See you around...

27:15.467 --> 27:16.735
Holden.

27:17.402 --> 27:18.670
Bye.

27:22.607 --> 27:25.076
I actually spoke to
Jenny Johnstone.

27:42.460 --> 27:43.861
Finally. What took you?

27:43.862 --> 27:45.897
I ran into someone I know.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.401
Look there.

27:51.269 --> 27:52.569
Mine's stuck.

27:52.570 --> 27:54.039
Leave it. Ride with me.

28:07.719 --> 28:11.588
Yeah!

28:11.589 --> 28:13.357
- We lost them.
- Piece of cake.

28:13.358 --> 28:16.761
Well, Matt, looks like your little
crystal ball was wrong about us.

28:20.465 --> 28:22.067
Uh, I wouldn't be so sure.

28:31.443 --> 28:32.944
Go, go, go!

28:41.352 --> 28:43.253
They're definitely not janitors.

28:43.254 --> 28:45.622
Whoever they are,
they're coming fast.

28:45.623 --> 28:46.891
What do we do?

28:47.492 --> 28:49.993
You tell us, you tell us.

28:49.994 --> 28:51.895
Grab and hold onto
my bike, Eddie.

28:51.896 --> 28:54.032
- What?
- Just do it.

28:57.268 --> 28:59.137
- Quick, quick.
- Grab it.

29:03.708 --> 29:05.009
Got it.

29:05.777 --> 29:08.213
Mel, grab on the
back of my bike too.

29:10.381 --> 29:11.449
Come on.

29:12.317 --> 29:14.585
- Do it.
- I can't get it.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.887
Come on, Mel.

29:18.456 --> 29:19.524
Xircon?

29:20.125 --> 29:21.226
I got it.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.360
Okay, hold on.

29:37.142 --> 29:39.443
Hold on, they're gaining on us.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.612
Boomer, go faster.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.380
I can't.

29:43.381 --> 29:47.152
The ratio of the bike chain appears
circumference is at maximum tolerance.

29:51.022 --> 29:52.090
No.

29:52.557 --> 29:53.825
No!

30:09.307 --> 30:10.641
They're gaining on us.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.211
Whatever you're gonna
do, do it now.

30:15.780 --> 30:18.349
Come on. They'll run us down.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.494
Who's the zeros now?

30:35.633 --> 30:37.501
Oh-oh, they're back.

30:37.502 --> 30:38.903
Do something quick.

30:40.271 --> 30:41.605
They're coming.

30:41.606 --> 30:43.541
Well, now, Bauer.

30:59.824 --> 31:02.626
It didn't work. Try
something else.

31:02.627 --> 31:04.863
I can't peddle much longer.

31:26.017 --> 31:30.154
Yeah!

31:32.724 --> 31:34.092
Yes!

31:36.027 --> 31:37.027
Ew!

31:39.631 --> 31:41.232
That's not helping.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.337
- We did it.
- That's amazing.

31:47.338 --> 31:49.139
Man, that was better
than Grand Theft Auto.

31:49.140 --> 31:50.541
Did you see those guys?

31:51.042 --> 31:52.644
Mud all over them.

31:53.611 --> 31:55.380
That wasn't mud.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.347
Ew!

31:57.348 --> 31:59.683
Guys, this is not funny.

31:59.684 --> 32:01.885
Okay. They were
trying to get us.

32:01.886 --> 32:03.320
We have to go to the police.

32:03.321 --> 32:05.889
We can't now. I dropped that
ball and they've got it.

32:05.890 --> 32:08.225
Without the hologram,
they'll never believe us.

32:08.226 --> 32:10.193
Let's go home and
tell our parents.

32:10.194 --> 32:12.729
No. If those guys can
find us at school,

32:12.730 --> 32:14.831
they probably know
where we live.

32:14.832 --> 32:17.734
We'll call our parents and tell them that
we're sleeping over at each other's houses.

32:17.735 --> 32:20.438
If we're not going home,
or to the police,

32:21.005 --> 32:22.307
where are we gonna go?

32:22.874 --> 32:24.142
Our home away from home.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.247
Maybe we should just
get rid of them.

32:30.248 --> 32:32.683
No way. I'm not finished with
Bryce and his friends yet.

32:32.684 --> 32:35.886
Okay, look, we cannot keep them.
It's too dangerous.

32:39.757 --> 32:41.426
Uh, what? Am I still smart?

32:44.162 --> 32:46.364
- What was that?
- Just the wind.

32:48.366 --> 32:49.434
Shush...

32:50.535 --> 32:53.438
Hey, guys, where's the box?

33:00.611 --> 33:04.481
They know about this
cabin, you have to leave.

33:04.482 --> 33:08.052
Wait. Aren't you the guy
from our neighborhood?

33:10.855 --> 33:12.255
Ooh.

33:12.256 --> 33:14.825
I love what you've
done with this place.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.729
Very nuevo-rustic.
Do you get wi-fi?

33:18.696 --> 33:21.031
What are you doing here?
Who are you?

33:21.032 --> 33:22.666
Allow me to introduce myself,

33:22.667 --> 33:26.738
my name is William Wisconsin,
but everyone calls me, Wizz.

33:29.273 --> 33:32.509
Okay, Mr. Wizz, what do
you know about all this?

33:32.510 --> 33:35.513
I think the better question
is, what do you know?

33:36.214 --> 33:38.116
Let me see those plans.

33:40.118 --> 33:42.352
From inside the box
that you found.

33:42.353 --> 33:45.957
The only thing we found in the
box were a bunch of toys.

33:46.257 --> 33:47.924
Toys?

33:47.925 --> 33:49.761
What in god's name are
you talking about?

34:03.274 --> 34:04.475
Amazing.

34:06.110 --> 34:07.445
I look awful.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.549
A bunch of toys.

34:12.550 --> 34:15.252
Seven years, they trying to bring
something back from the future,

34:15.253 --> 34:17.221
all they get is a box of toys.

34:18.022 --> 34:19.489
What are you doing?

34:20.058 --> 34:21.559
I'm getting out of Dodge.

34:22.627 --> 34:23.893
Why?

34:23.895 --> 34:25.795
They want the plans to
something more deadly

34:25.797 --> 34:27.231
and they're not gonna stop now.

34:28.565 --> 34:29.801
I know too much.

34:31.101 --> 34:33.070
I started the Pandora Project.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.505
I was a chief engineer.

34:35.505 --> 34:37.306
Darn!

34:37.308 --> 34:40.177
When I figured out what
Weller was after, I quit.

34:40.178 --> 34:42.145
I swore I'd never work again.

34:42.146 --> 34:44.915
See, Weller's not just
buying up your neighborhood

34:44.916 --> 34:47.251
to build a mall and
some kiddie parks.

34:47.685 --> 34:49.485
What is he doing?

34:49.487 --> 34:51.222
He's gonna destroy the future.

34:53.291 --> 34:57.594
One of the toys we found was
some type of hologram Wikipedia.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.329
It showed us
tomorrow's newspaper.

34:59.330 --> 35:00.765
It said that we were missing.

35:01.399 --> 35:02.666
What do we do?

35:02.667 --> 35:05.302
Wait a minute, a toy that
can show the future?

35:05.303 --> 35:07.572
That could give us the
proof to stop Weller.

35:08.406 --> 35:09.574
Which one is it?

35:12.343 --> 35:13.678
We don't have it anymore.

35:13.978 --> 35:15.413
Weller does.

35:15.613 --> 35:16.880
Great.

35:16.881 --> 35:19.584
Tell Billy, I said hello.
And goodbye.

35:20.518 --> 35:24.221
Wait, Mr. Wizz,
you've gotta help us.

35:24.222 --> 35:28.191
Look kid, I used to think I
can change things, be a hero.

35:28.192 --> 35:30.427
I don't live in that
fantasy world anymore.

35:30.428 --> 35:34.232
Unless you find that hologram,
nothing is gonna help you.

35:39.871 --> 35:41.271
He's right.

35:41.272 --> 35:42.873
We've gotta get that ball back.

35:42.874 --> 35:44.508
- Let's...
- You're nuts.

35:44.509 --> 35:47.278
It's the only way we could save
ourselves and our neighborhood.

35:47.879 --> 35:49.679
When I was in the library,

35:49.680 --> 35:52.949
I heard those two guys talking about
some meeting tonight at Heaven's Stone.

35:52.950 --> 35:54.252
What's that?

35:54.652 --> 35:56.319
Just searched it.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.421
The residence of Billy Weller.

35:58.422 --> 36:00.791
We can get in there, with
the help of these toys.

36:01.692 --> 36:04.528
- I don't have time for this.
- Why?

36:04.529 --> 36:07.497
Too busy using your gloves to
get back at people you hate?

36:07.498 --> 36:09.666
You're acting just like Bryce.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.768
Guys, don't you see?

36:11.769 --> 36:14.337
You can't just act like
none of this ever happened.

36:14.338 --> 36:18.742
It has. And now it's up to
us to do something about it.

36:18.743 --> 36:21.178
Those guys, they have real guns,

36:21.179 --> 36:23.980
with real bullets.
Not fake poop.

36:23.981 --> 36:25.650
Yeah, we can't go
up against them.

36:26.250 --> 36:27.752
You're talking like zeros.

36:28.586 --> 36:30.020
If we give up now,

36:30.021 --> 36:33.324
that's exactly what we're gonna
be for the rest of our lives.

36:33.891 --> 36:35.560
If we live that long.

36:37.328 --> 36:39.230
And I still hate these arches.

36:54.445 --> 36:56.146
Two guards, how can
we gonna get in?

36:56.147 --> 36:59.549
We can't just ask nicely. Matt,
how are these toys gonna help us?

36:59.550 --> 37:00.784
I got it.

37:00.785 --> 37:03.721
With the help of these gloves,
I'll take both guards out.

37:04.121 --> 37:05.255
Hiya!

37:05.256 --> 37:07.624
Okay, no. I don't hear you.

37:07.625 --> 37:11.161
I'm gonna run super fast past
them, they won't even see me.

37:11.162 --> 37:13.330
Identify optimum
avenue of approach,

37:13.331 --> 37:16.233
employ counter maneuvers,
commence active information.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.434
Wait, guys.

37:17.435 --> 37:19.570
Why don't we just see if
they have a back door

37:20.938 --> 37:22.273
Or we could do that.

37:45.162 --> 37:46.430
This is the meeting.

37:46.964 --> 37:48.598
We gotta get in there.

37:48.599 --> 37:51.469
Sure, let's just waltz right in.

37:52.903 --> 37:55.373
I'm checking the city
hall building records.

37:59.176 --> 38:01.444
Got it. There a passage
way end of the stairs

38:01.445 --> 38:03.380
That'll take us straight
to the back of the room.

38:03.381 --> 38:06.349
Mel, you're like the coolest
Apple on the planet.

38:06.350 --> 38:08.918
I know. Follow me.

38:08.919 --> 38:13.089
All right, gentlemen, we have
some good news and some bad news.

38:13.090 --> 38:14.825
First the good news, Franklin...

38:15.826 --> 38:17.028
I wrote it down.

38:22.466 --> 38:26.536
As promised, our quantum teleportation
of a solid state system,

38:26.537 --> 38:29.839
was a success. A
Scientific breakthrough.

38:29.840 --> 38:33.843
We found a negative mass wormhole
with significant exotic matter,

38:33.844 --> 38:38.848
and brought an object from the
future, into the present.

38:38.849 --> 38:40.550
That's ours.

38:40.551 --> 38:44.421
It didn't arrive exactly
where we planned,

38:44.422 --> 38:48.091
but that problem has
been corrected.

38:48.092 --> 38:52.996
As you can see, this was
supposed to contain blueprints.

38:52.997 --> 38:57.400
Unfortunately, all we
found inside, was this.

38:57.401 --> 38:58.902
What is it?

38:58.903 --> 39:03.473
Well, we don't, know yet. But
what we do know is that it takes

39:03.474 --> 39:07.210
advanced highly developed
intelligence to open it and power.

39:07.211 --> 39:08.713
Yeah, Bauer.

39:10.014 --> 39:12.282
Any more, ice cream?

39:12.283 --> 39:14.284
Rocky Roads is my favorite.

39:14.285 --> 39:16.319
All right, this concerns
me not just for us

39:16.320 --> 39:18.288
but for our allies as well.

39:18.289 --> 39:20.857
No, of course. We
understand that.

39:20.858 --> 39:24.494
And we really do wanna address
all of your concerns.

39:24.495 --> 39:29.165
Every contingency has been
looked at from every angle.

39:29.166 --> 39:33.470
Now that we've proven that the
Pandora Project is a success,

39:33.471 --> 39:37.807
why settle for plans when
we can get the real thing.

39:37.808 --> 39:41.778
Gentlemen, tomorrow
morning, at 08:00 hours,

39:41.779 --> 39:45.049
we're going to grab
the shadow itself.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.052
You could do that? This soon?

39:48.853 --> 39:49.987
Well, in a word...

39:50.254 --> 39:51.655
Oh, yes.

39:52.156 --> 39:53.823
That was two words.

39:53.824 --> 39:56.659
All right, this case is small. What
happens if something goes wrong?

39:56.660 --> 40:00.630
I assure you it won't. We've
taken every precaution.

40:00.631 --> 40:04.935
Tomorrow morning, Pandora's
box will be open.

40:06.003 --> 40:09.907
Gentlemen, the future awaits.

40:17.381 --> 40:18.749
Gentlemen...

40:20.918 --> 40:22.485
What's a shadow?

40:22.486 --> 40:23.987
What's Pandora's box?

40:23.988 --> 40:26.891
I don't know but they don't sound good.
Come on.

40:28.759 --> 40:31.227
Too much ice cream. Sugar crash.

40:31.228 --> 40:35.865
Later tonight, take this ball thingy and
this box back to the lab for testing.

40:35.866 --> 40:37.300
All right, what
about those kids?

40:37.301 --> 40:38.835
I-I'm not worried
about the kids.

40:38.836 --> 40:41.739
Yeah, they're probably at home
with their mommys and daddys.

40:42.807 --> 40:43.874
Uh, okay.

40:48.212 --> 40:49.946
Great plan, Bauer.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.181
What now?

40:51.182 --> 40:53.049
We gotta get to that lab.

40:53.050 --> 40:55.752
- Boomer, Google the address.
- Way ahead of you.

40:55.753 --> 40:59.789
All right. 24,000
Pine Hill Road.

40:59.790 --> 41:02.125
- That has to be it. Let's go.
- Okay.

41:06.564 --> 41:09.533
- Oh gosh, oh gosh...
- Wait, upstairs.

41:16.941 --> 41:18.542
Ow, Mel, get off my foot.

41:19.443 --> 41:20.743
Someone get the lights.

41:20.744 --> 41:22.179
I think I see the light.

41:26.383 --> 41:28.384
Jenny! What are you doing here?

41:28.385 --> 41:29.586
I live here.

41:29.587 --> 41:32.322
Whoa, wait, Weller's
your step-dad?

41:32.323 --> 41:35.258
Yes. And who are you?

41:35.259 --> 41:37.228
Wait, don't you guys
go to my school?

41:37.828 --> 41:38.962
Yeah.

41:38.963 --> 41:42.232
I'm Matt Bauer, but
I can explain.

41:42.233 --> 41:44.735
We... Um, all of us... I...

41:45.369 --> 41:46.637
Holden will explain.

41:47.071 --> 41:48.238
Holden?

41:48.239 --> 41:49.639
Holden?

41:49.640 --> 41:52.642
Yeah. Holden, my cousin.

41:52.643 --> 41:54.979
He had to go to the
bathroom, I'll go get him.

41:56.480 --> 41:57.915
What is going on?

41:58.949 --> 42:01.284
You guys better have a
good explanation for this.

42:01.285 --> 42:02.820
There's security
all around here.

42:03.254 --> 42:04.387
Yeah, we saw them.

42:04.388 --> 42:08.559
You're very... guarded
like, a tiger.

42:14.431 --> 42:16.866
Matt had to use the
bathroom anyway.

42:16.867 --> 42:19.069
Holden, what's this all about?

42:20.571 --> 42:23.106
Wow. You can Matt
really dress alike.

42:23.107 --> 42:25.008
Yup. They sure do.

42:25.009 --> 42:28.177
So, do you know about
the Pandora Project?

42:28.178 --> 42:30.748
I overheard my step-father
talking about it.

42:31.048 --> 42:32.615
Why?

42:32.616 --> 42:35.052
This is gonna sound
really strange but, um...

42:36.186 --> 42:37.988
It has to do with time travel.

42:39.690 --> 42:42.525
Your step-dad brought toys
here from the future.

42:42.526 --> 42:44.027
And tomorrow morning,

42:44.028 --> 42:46.830
he's gonna bring something else
that will change everything.

42:47.264 --> 42:48.599
For the worse.

42:51.135 --> 42:54.705
Yeah, right. You've been reading
way too much science fiction.

42:56.273 --> 42:57.608
Watch this.

43:11.789 --> 43:15.125
- Okay...
- Watch this.

43:21.966 --> 43:23.833
What was that? How
did you do that?

43:23.834 --> 43:25.935
That is physically impossible.

43:25.936 --> 43:28.871
Not with shoes from
25 years from now.

43:28.872 --> 43:31.174
One of the toys can
show the future.

43:31.175 --> 43:35.345
But it's in your step-dad's
lab, can you help us get it?

43:35.346 --> 43:38.916
You guys all live where my step-dad's
project is gonna be built, right?

43:39.917 --> 43:41.752
Everyone says you're
lying to stop it.

43:42.319 --> 43:44.153
No, no.

43:44.154 --> 43:47.224
We're just trying to save our
homes, you have to believe us.

43:49.727 --> 43:52.896
Jenny, it's security, we heard
voices upstairs. Are you okay?

43:56.667 --> 43:58.368
This is Jenny.
Someone's in my room.

43:58.369 --> 43:59.970
Okay, time to go.

44:04.408 --> 44:06.476
I guess I was wrong about you.

44:06.477 --> 44:08.379
You are just like them.

44:09.613 --> 44:11.382
Matt, gotta go.

44:19.823 --> 44:20.924
Matt?

44:22.159 --> 44:23.893
Who's Holden?

44:23.894 --> 44:26.329
Just some guy Jenny
was starting to like.

44:26.330 --> 44:27.597
The mask's off.

44:27.598 --> 44:29.767
Guard, guard, guard.

44:32.436 --> 44:33.771
We gotta go.

44:35.272 --> 44:38.941
Hello, it's so great
to finally meet you.

44:38.942 --> 44:40.510
Franklin's has told
me so much about you.

44:40.511 --> 44:44.080
If you found anything else in
that box, it belongs to us.

44:44.081 --> 44:46.849
You... You know, you're right...

44:46.850 --> 44:50.086
We're really sorry
about, all of this.

44:50.087 --> 44:53.589
We'll give you the toys back
and maybe you can let us go.

44:53.590 --> 44:54.958
What are you doing?

45:08.505 --> 45:10.441
Ugh, sticky.

45:11.375 --> 45:13.309
We gotta go. We gotta go.

45:13.310 --> 45:14.377
Bye.

45:18.215 --> 45:19.450
Let go of me.

45:23.754 --> 45:25.955
All right, enough. Enough.

45:25.956 --> 45:29.827
Jenny, go back to your
room, everything is fine.

45:32.796 --> 45:35.432
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't...

45:49.146 --> 45:50.481
Hey, come here.

45:54.518 --> 45:56.886
Wonderful. Another guard.

45:56.887 --> 45:58.856
Weller's keeping a lot
of them employed.

45:59.456 --> 46:00.957
What's the play?

46:00.958 --> 46:03.427
I don't know. I'm thinking.

46:07.865 --> 46:09.299
I can help.

46:11.502 --> 46:12.936
Did you bring your security?

46:13.570 --> 46:16.339
Look, I'm sorry about that,

46:16.340 --> 46:18.876
but it all sounded so weird.

46:19.510 --> 46:21.277
How's I supposed to react?

46:21.278 --> 46:24.380
I don't know. Maybe by
giving us a chance.

46:24.381 --> 46:26.249
Not just going off by
what other people say.

46:26.250 --> 46:28.151
Bryce and his group
aren't my friends.

46:28.152 --> 46:31.320
Believe me. I hate those snobs.

46:31.321 --> 46:34.158
Look, whatever my step-father is
up to, I'm sure it's not good.

46:34.591 --> 46:35.958
I wanna help.

46:35.959 --> 46:37.861
How do we know we can trust her?

46:39.763 --> 46:41.764
Can you get us inside?

46:41.765 --> 46:43.473
Getting four of you in
there, past the guard

46:43.485 --> 46:45.205
and into the underground
lab is impossible.

46:45.903 --> 46:48.071
But, maybe one.

46:49.807 --> 46:51.308
Where's Holden?

46:55.879 --> 46:58.815
- Matt, you better tell her.
- Yeah.

46:58.816 --> 47:00.184
Tell me what?

47:02.719 --> 47:04.154
He-he's not really...

47:06.657 --> 47:07.857
here.

47:07.858 --> 47:09.992
He... He's down by
the golf carts.

47:09.993 --> 47:11.661
You can meet him there.

47:11.662 --> 47:13.363
We'll... We'll wait
for you outside.

47:13.630 --> 47:14.965
Good luck.

47:16.366 --> 47:17.534
Jenny...

47:19.703 --> 47:21.038
Thanks.

47:25.042 --> 47:26.610
Just gimme the mask. Come on.

47:33.584 --> 47:35.451
Jenny? You came?

47:35.452 --> 47:37.321
Maybe I'm not the
girl you think I am.

47:37.955 --> 47:39.456
You could say the same for me.

47:40.290 --> 47:41.924
Now, how do we get in?

47:41.925 --> 47:43.293
That's why I'm here.

47:49.266 --> 47:50.534
Jenny?

47:52.736 --> 47:55.071
What are you doing
out here so late?

47:55.072 --> 47:57.974
My step-dad wanted me to get
some more stuff left in the lab.

47:57.975 --> 47:59.509
You know how he is
about homework.

48:00.444 --> 48:02.612
At 11 o'clock at night?

48:02.613 --> 48:04.314
He can be a real pain sometimes.

48:06.950 --> 48:08.385
I-I better give him a call.

48:16.894 --> 48:18.861
Sure, call him.

48:18.862 --> 48:20.463
Maybe he'll be in a
better mood this time.

48:20.464 --> 48:22.064
He fired he last guard
that woke him up.

48:22.065 --> 48:23.666
Hello, McGibson,

48:23.667 --> 48:26.169
why are you calling my
private cell phone number?

48:31.708 --> 48:33.043
Go ahead.

48:34.645 --> 48:36.013
Straight A's.

48:36.446 --> 48:37.614
Study hard.

48:40.183 --> 48:44.153
Lucky for you, I know where my
step-father hides the code.

48:44.154 --> 48:46.990
- What are we looking for?
- All right. There.

48:55.966 --> 48:58.001
What's so important about this?

48:58.235 --> 48:59.369
Watch.

49:13.317 --> 49:16.385
[robotic voicWelcome
to Holopedia, 7.0,

49:16.386 --> 49:18.221
updated every year.

49:21.825 --> 49:25.094
Holographic projections.
Amazing.

49:25.095 --> 49:27.096
Like I said, this
shows the future.

49:27.097 --> 49:29.966
And what your step-father
is gonna do with it.

49:29.967 --> 49:34.370
Search American history,
25 years from now.

49:34.371 --> 49:38.774
America, 25 years in the future is
the dominant leader of the world.

49:38.775 --> 49:43.145
The richest of Americans far surpass
those in any other country.

49:43.146 --> 49:45.181
Unemployment is only 50 percent.

49:45.182 --> 49:49.885
And less than 73 percent of the
population live under the poverty line.

49:49.886 --> 49:53.923
Despite the treat of nuclear war
from every region on the globe.

49:53.924 --> 49:57.426
Our leader assures us
that we will be safe.

49:57.427 --> 49:58.628
That's my step-dad.

49:59.663 --> 50:02.198
My fellow Americans,

50:02.199 --> 50:05.634
the chimes of midnight
as fast approaching.

50:05.635 --> 50:07.236
But we will prevail.

50:07.237 --> 50:11.040
When I brought sophisticated
technology and weapons here,

50:11.041 --> 50:13.609
twenty-five years ago
and became your leader.

50:13.610 --> 50:18.681
I did so with one purpose in
mind, to strengthen America.

50:18.682 --> 50:21.118
We did that and so much more.

50:21.785 --> 50:23.420
He's going to run America.

50:24.388 --> 50:26.590
Not if we get this
to the police.

50:26.923 --> 50:28.525
Shut down.

50:40.804 --> 50:42.105
All right, get him.

50:44.808 --> 50:51.181
Oh, so uncool. You should
be more careful next time.

50:52.282 --> 50:54.217
I can't wait to play with this.

50:55.752 --> 50:57.119
Let go of me.

50:57.120 --> 50:58.555
Don't hurt him.

50:59.790 --> 51:01.058
Get off me.

51:02.793 --> 51:04.161
Matt?

51:05.028 --> 51:07.630
This was in that box too?

51:07.631 --> 51:09.166
So cool!

51:09.633 --> 51:10.834
Mr. Weller.

51:11.768 --> 51:13.270
Look who we found.

51:14.337 --> 51:18.674
Oh, perfect. Now I
can show all of you,

51:18.675 --> 51:22.411
what you'll be missing,
tomorrow morning.

51:22.412 --> 51:25.781
Welcome to the greatest
invention of the 21st century.

51:25.782 --> 51:27.416
The Pandora Project.

51:27.417 --> 51:31.388
That's a quantum computer,
just like the Pentagon uses.

51:31.955 --> 51:33.722
Very good.

51:33.723 --> 51:38.727
A 512 cubit to be exact. The most
complex system ever designed.

51:38.728 --> 51:40.930
The Pentagon only has one.

51:40.931 --> 51:42.531
We have two.

51:42.532 --> 51:45.968
Up there, is another
one, just like this one.

51:45.969 --> 51:49.572
In case this one fails, but
that's just the beginning.

51:49.573 --> 51:55.745
Anything, from the past or the
future, can be brought right here.

51:56.880 --> 51:59.315
Nothing living yet,

51:59.316 --> 52:01.617
but once we move
into Xircon Plaza,

52:01.618 --> 52:04.587
we'll be on the strongest meridian
point in the United States.

52:04.588 --> 52:09.091
Only your homes and the
inconvenience of a few species

52:09.092 --> 52:12.361
are keeping us from moving living things
like sending someone back in time.

52:12.362 --> 52:15.631
To make a few adjustments.

52:15.632 --> 52:19.034
Until then, we will follow what
offers the best opportunity.

52:19.035 --> 52:22.972
We've been sending waves into a
fissure in the space time continuum,

52:22.973 --> 52:26.041
which come back as images and
using that, we've created a map.

52:26.042 --> 52:30.079
Which has helped us to locate exactly
what we've been looking for.

52:30.080 --> 52:32.282
- Franklin.
- Yes. Yes.

52:37.087 --> 52:38.455
The Shadow.

52:40.790 --> 52:42.791
Very good. Ahead of the class.

52:42.792 --> 52:46.562
In 25 years, that will be a
relic in a military hanger

52:46.563 --> 52:52.434
but to us, now, it makes our
weapon systems look like toys.

52:52.435 --> 52:54.570
- Franklin, can you pan right?
- Sure.

52:54.571 --> 52:57.807
- No, my right.
- Yeah. Yeah. Right.

52:59.743 --> 53:02.678
Franklin, these graphics are so
bad, when are we gonna upgrade it?

53:02.679 --> 53:04.747
I'm sorry, the I.T.
guy is on vacation.

53:04.748 --> 53:06.982
That's the box we found.

53:06.983 --> 53:09.885
We thought the plans would be
in that box, they weren't.

53:09.886 --> 53:13.589
But we wanted to test quantum
teleportation with something small.

53:13.590 --> 53:16.825
We were able to determine
the spin rate and direction

53:16.826 --> 53:19.895
of it's entangled partner in
the future and pull that box,

53:19.896 --> 53:23.299
right through a
wormhole in space.

53:23.300 --> 53:25.235
How did you keep
the wormhole open?

53:27.003 --> 53:30.873
Jenny, at least you've been
paying attention in school...

53:30.874 --> 53:32.508
We've been using
negative energy,

53:32.509 --> 53:34.510
all calculated by our
quantum computer.

53:34.511 --> 53:39.281
And now that our coordinates have been
corrected, tomorrow morning at 08:00 hours

53:39.282 --> 53:41.951
we're gonna grab
the shadow itself.

53:41.952 --> 53:43.519
And with that
advance technology,

53:43.520 --> 53:46.455
our capabilities
will be limitless.

53:46.456 --> 53:48.258
So that's how
you're gonna do it.

53:49.092 --> 53:50.759
Do what?

53:50.760 --> 53:52.394
Destroy the future.

53:52.395 --> 53:55.164
Oh, so you-you think...

53:55.165 --> 53:58.500
you think that all
this fancy technology,

53:58.501 --> 54:03.240
is gonna turn me into a madman
who's going to destroy the world

54:04.441 --> 54:05.642
Yeah.

54:05.976 --> 54:07.743
Not!

54:07.744 --> 54:11.247
I'm not gonna destroy the
world, I'm gonna save it.

54:11.248 --> 54:15.418
For you, you, you, you. For you.

54:16.853 --> 54:18.822
I'm going to control it.

54:19.556 --> 54:20.956
Right?

54:20.957 --> 54:22.591
Take them away.

54:22.592 --> 54:25.661
Go, take them go. Take 'em away.

54:25.662 --> 54:27.529
- Stop it. That hurts.
- Let me go.

54:27.530 --> 54:30.766
You wanted to know what I was
doing, all you had to do was ask.

54:30.767 --> 54:35.037
[JennReally? You barely talk to me since
mom went to take care of grandma.

54:35.038 --> 54:36.839
Don't you bring up your mother?

54:36.840 --> 54:40.710
I'm doing this for her and for you. You
have no idea how important this is.

54:41.745 --> 54:42.846
More than you know.

54:43.413 --> 54:44.480
What are you doing?

54:44.481 --> 54:47.016
Tonight, you stay
in the safe room.

54:47.017 --> 54:49.418
No one comes in and
no one goes out.

54:49.419 --> 54:52.388
And by the way, don't get
too attached to those boys.

54:52.389 --> 54:54.758
Oh, and don't forget
to brush your teeth.

55:05.969 --> 55:07.871
Oh, yes. Go, go.

55:08.972 --> 55:10.239
Where's the ball?

55:10.240 --> 55:12.474
We'll take it. What's the rent?

55:12.475 --> 55:14.978
It's free. So glad you like it.

55:15.779 --> 55:17.780
You lucked out, the
closet was too small.

55:17.781 --> 55:21.450
FYI, all the doors and windows are
locked and alarm from the outside so,

55:21.451 --> 55:25.321
if you try to escape, my good friends
here will be happy to escort you back.

55:25.322 --> 55:27.991
Now, let's hand everything over.

55:28.658 --> 55:29.793
Right over there.

55:37.334 --> 55:39.234
Oh, I'm mad at you.

55:39.235 --> 55:42.438
Stick that over... I
don't wanna touch that.

55:42.439 --> 55:44.606
Okay, anything else,
any other surprises?

55:44.607 --> 55:46.208
You can't keep us here.

55:46.209 --> 55:49.211
Oh, I think I can,
who's gonna stop me?

55:49.212 --> 55:54.817
According to U.S. Code, Title 18,
Part One, Chapter 55, Section 1201,

55:54.818 --> 55:58.722
kidnapping of a minor is a federal offense.
Punishable up to five years.

56:00.924 --> 56:02.391
Any more surprises?

56:02.392 --> 56:04.794
Hands. Let's take those off.

56:06.663 --> 56:09.699
I think I'd like
the shoes as well.

56:10.967 --> 56:13.369
There you go. Hustle it up.

56:13.370 --> 56:18.907
Got five more seconds,
four, three, two, and one.

56:18.908 --> 56:22.010
Perfect, now I have all my
Christmas shopping done.

56:22.011 --> 56:25.447
Fellas, I want you to come back
here and remove all the sugars.

56:25.448 --> 56:28.518
All these peaks and crashes.

56:33.123 --> 56:34.523
They're gonna kill us.

56:34.524 --> 56:35.691
They can't do that.

56:35.692 --> 56:38.694
Great. Just when I was
getting over my FTD.

56:38.695 --> 56:41.564
- Whats that?
- Fear of dying disorder.

56:43.666 --> 56:46.535
Jenny and I saw a glimpse
into the future.

56:46.536 --> 56:48.605
Everything was so horrible.

56:49.439 --> 56:50.907
We're never getting outta here.

56:53.042 --> 56:56.045
It's all my fault.
It's always my fault.

56:57.313 --> 57:00.049
I'm just a zero. Always will be.

57:00.717 --> 57:01.851
Matt...

57:02.852 --> 57:04.421
We're all zeros.

57:05.155 --> 57:06.555
And it's not so bad.

57:06.556 --> 57:10.692
I mean, who else gets to ride
bikes at 80 miles an hour?

57:10.693 --> 57:13.195
Crush Bryce at basketball,

57:13.196 --> 57:17.734
and spray Weller's guys with enough
poop to make them reek, forever.

57:19.536 --> 57:22.739
We maybe zeros but we're
pretty darn awesome.

57:24.474 --> 57:25.908
He's right.

57:25.909 --> 57:27.043
- Thanks.
- Come on.

57:43.359 --> 57:48.330
As you know, I offered this project to
the government but they laughed at me.

57:48.331 --> 57:50.098
Politicians.

57:50.099 --> 57:53.268
You gentlemen understand, whoever
controls technology, controls everything.

57:53.269 --> 57:56.305
Yeah but why stop 25 years from now?
Why no go further?

57:56.306 --> 57:59.608
Twenty-five? We can certainly go
further and we certainly will.

57:59.609 --> 58:01.043
How many of these are there?

58:01.044 --> 58:03.712
We found ten so far. but there
are many other weapons.

58:03.713 --> 58:07.115
As soon as Pandora's Box is
open, there's no turning back.

58:07.116 --> 58:10.219
Have a seat. Don't hover,
you make me nervous.

58:10.220 --> 58:11.787
- Franklin?
- Here you are.

58:11.788 --> 58:13.790
- Thank you.
- Gentlemen.

58:16.626 --> 58:19.061
This is level... This is level
one, I'm on level five.

58:19.062 --> 58:20.762
I know, I've reset it.

58:20.763 --> 58:24.033
But if you've reset it, I get to go back
to the beginning, I've earned level five.

58:26.336 --> 58:27.836
What time is it?

58:27.837 --> 58:30.940
Seven. Only one hour till
Weller gets his plane.

58:33.076 --> 58:35.410
Boomer.

58:35.411 --> 58:38.681
I just had this weird dream where
we all had to save the world.

58:40.049 --> 58:42.217
Okay, please tell me
that was a dream.

58:42.218 --> 58:44.654
Mel!

58:47.357 --> 58:49.424
Chocolate cake and cold pizza?

58:49.425 --> 58:50.860
I love this place!

59:05.375 --> 59:06.608
Wizz?

59:06.609 --> 59:09.444
Pick the fruit. Whoa!
Where's the ghost?

59:09.445 --> 59:10.947
Oh, where am I?

59:12.248 --> 59:13.616
Who's here?

59:15.318 --> 59:16.552
Oh.

59:16.553 --> 59:18.120
It's you boys...

59:18.121 --> 59:20.924
Sorry I always dream
about playing Pac Man.

59:21.524 --> 59:23.358
So Weller got you too?

59:23.359 --> 59:25.261
Yeah, you okay?

59:25.962 --> 59:27.030
I will be.

59:29.699 --> 59:32.267
Try the cake, it's so moist.

59:32.268 --> 59:33.936
Wizz, we know everything.

59:33.937 --> 59:36.072
Weller's getting that plane
in less than an hour.

59:36.506 --> 59:38.206
A toast.

59:38.207 --> 59:39.708
To the greatest inventions!

59:39.709 --> 59:43.378
Gunpowder, the atomic bomb,
and now, the Pandora Project.

59:43.379 --> 59:46.950
May geniuses like me stop working
for mad men like Weller.

59:48.818 --> 59:50.686
There's got to be
a way outta here.

59:50.687 --> 59:52.621
Yeah, without setting
off the alarms.

59:52.622 --> 59:55.824
Impossible. Every exit is wired.
I checked it out.

59:55.825 --> 59:58.060
I got it! How about
the air went?

59:58.061 --> 01:00:01.997
I checked that too. Too
small, even for a kid.

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:05.867
I know I'm not smart and everything but
this house has secret passageways.

01:00:05.868 --> 01:00:07.769
Maybe there's one in here.

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:10.139
- Good idea.
- Yeah.

01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:12.208
Okay, let's look.

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:24.320
Nothing here.

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:26.789
Or here.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:29.359
Nothing.

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:33.062
Sorry, it's just
another stupid idea.

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:41.303
What?

01:00:41.304 --> 01:00:43.206
Mel, you're a genius.

01:00:43.506 --> 01:00:45.273
Turn around.

01:00:45.274 --> 01:00:48.610
Wow. I've never figured
anything out before.

01:00:48.611 --> 01:00:50.579
Maybe if I had more often.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.249
Okay. Let's not
get carried away.

01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:57.086
Wizz, you coming with us?

01:00:59.022 --> 01:01:00.322
Why?

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:01.957
What is there for me out there?

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:04.893
Maybe if you stop drinking,
you'll find out.

01:01:04.894 --> 01:01:06.728
What do you know,
you're just a kid.

01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:08.597
Come with us, Wizz.

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:10.867
Maybe this is your chance
to be a hero again.

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:18.240
Jenny, where are you?

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:20.175
I'm in here.

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:23.112
- You in there? -The door
is locked, I can't get out.

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:27.116
This hero stuff better
start getting easier.

01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:30.986
All right, genius,
use your head.

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:32.320
Yeah?

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:37.626
- Good job.
- Thanks.

01:01:37.627 --> 01:01:39.394
Boy, am I glad to see you guys.

01:01:39.395 --> 01:01:42.698
Jenny, I'd like to introduce you
to our really good friend...

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:45.267
- Wizz!
- Jenny, Jenny...

01:01:45.268 --> 01:01:47.069
It's so good to see you.

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:49.104
- Sorry about the smell.
- It's okay.

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:51.907
Matt, I think I can get
my hands on a car.

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:53.375
Jenny, can I use your phone?

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:54.744
Yeah, it's downstairs.

01:01:57.146 --> 01:01:58.214
Hey Jenny...

01:01:58.981 --> 01:02:01.049
I'm sorry about Holden.

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:02.919
I guess I won't be needing
that mask anymore.

01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:04.854
You never did.

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:07.522
Do you know where the toys are?

01:02:07.523 --> 01:02:09.191
I know where my step-dad
hides everything.

01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:11.828
Come on, they're in the
storage room downstairs.

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:19.801
Stop hovering, you
make me nervous.

01:02:19.802 --> 01:02:21.570
Vector Warning.

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:24.539
Vector Warning. Vector Warning.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.807
What's happening?

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:30.747
Oh.

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:32.315
Pause it.

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:36.985
One moment.

01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:41.156
Every once in a while, the computer
detects a flaw in the weapon we selected.

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:43.959
It's like hitting a speed
bum in a gap through time.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.927
Initialing remedy sequencing.

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:47.596
Vector corrected.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.464
Resume sequence.

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:52.400
The computer spots it, new sequencing is
rewritten and the problem is corrected.

01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:53.869
What if you hit the speed bump?

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:55.570
Oh, well, in theory,

01:02:55.571 --> 01:02:59.975
a massive energy like an electrical
surge can travel back through time.

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:03.411
By controlling where the wave
ends up, one could have a...

01:03:03.412 --> 01:03:05.147
A very destructive weapon.

01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:07.582
Oh well... yeah.

01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:23.466
Oh. Oh, hey. Sorry sir, I
thought you were inside.

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:27.235
Yeah, right away, sir. Okay.

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:46.956
Sorry, sir. It's a little problem
with the gate. One second.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.061
You okay, sir?

01:03:52.895 --> 01:03:56.399
Yeah. One minute and...

01:03:58.301 --> 01:03:59.869
All right, there you go.

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:02.138
See ya.

01:04:04.207 --> 01:04:05.474
Have a good one.

01:04:44.213 --> 01:04:45.213
After you.

01:04:48.918 --> 01:04:52.320
Well, if it ain't
the four stooges.

01:04:52.321 --> 01:04:53.521
Yeah.

01:04:53.522 --> 01:04:55.457
Jenny's maid told me that,

01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:57.960
her and some of her friends
were gonna be here.

01:04:58.561 --> 01:04:59.996
Hello, Bryce.

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:02.898
I've been waiting for this.

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:04.733
Well, that makes two of us.

01:05:11.841 --> 01:05:13.342
Is that the best you can do?

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:22.451
- Get off me!
- I got it, I got.

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:25.154
This is gonna be fun.

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:46.141
What happened to the mask?

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:47.710
Looks like it's outta juice.

01:05:50.413 --> 01:05:51.714
Where are they?

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:01.157
You ready to quit, tough guy?

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:03.459
There's something wrong.

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:12.268
Clap your hand twice.

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:17.073
You want some more?

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.253
Do it, Eddie.

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:33.456
Pound him.

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:36.025
Bryce, get up.

01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:43.666
Let's get outta here.

01:06:51.073 --> 01:06:53.174
Eddie, you had Bryce. Okay?

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:55.143
You had him, you could
have finished him.

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:56.512
Why didn't you?

01:07:01.817 --> 01:07:03.352
'Cause then, I'll
be just like him.

01:07:03.719 --> 01:07:04.786
What?

01:07:04.787 --> 01:07:06.254
Are we being nice now?
Is this...

01:07:06.255 --> 01:07:07.722
I don't know how long

01:07:07.723 --> 01:07:10.259
the reserve powers on these
things are gonna last, but...

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.561
Here goes nothing.

01:07:22.004 --> 01:07:23.371
What took you so long?

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:25.306
We ran into some old friends.

01:07:25.307 --> 01:07:27.642
Have any of your toys
been loosing power?

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:28.811
Yeah, my gloves.

01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:30.678
My hat.

01:07:30.679 --> 01:07:32.148
My shoes, too.

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:35.884
The gun too.

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:37.653
Check if there's
a reserve power?

01:07:40.556 --> 01:07:41.590
Nope.

01:07:43.659 --> 01:07:47.062
Now what do we do? We got a
bunch of toys that don't work.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:49.931
We could just throw
them at the guards.

01:07:49.932 --> 01:07:52.500
How about we be as
violent as we want,

01:07:52.501 --> 01:07:56.305
in the safety and comfort of
our own video games, okay?

01:07:57.173 --> 01:07:59.074
- Come on.
- Or we could just...

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:01.510
give it a shot if that-that
works too. Okay.

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:08.717
Three minutes to transfer.

01:08:17.693 --> 01:08:19.127
Wow!

01:08:20.496 --> 01:08:23.231
Okay, we have to recharge
a couple of the toys.

01:08:23.232 --> 01:08:25.500
One small battery
will do the trick.

01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:28.136
Where's the Energizer
Bunny when you need him?

01:08:28.136 --> 01:08:29.770
Think I may have just found him.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:32.841
If they have quantum
computers, we can't stop them.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:37.645
If we get close enough to observe
the subatomic particles,

01:08:37.645 --> 01:08:38.712
we can actually affect them.

01:08:38.714 --> 01:08:41.015
And change their value.
That's brilliant, Jenny.

01:08:41.015 --> 01:08:42.484
Okay, here's the plan.

01:08:47.022 --> 01:08:50.292
Two more minutes, is
this awesome or what?

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.926
Franklin, where's my game?

01:08:52.928 --> 01:08:54.863
- Your what?
- Franklin.

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:58.133
I don't have it.
Did you loose it?

01:08:58.134 --> 01:08:59.502
Looking for this?

01:09:02.004 --> 01:09:05.273
Thanks for the battery.
It came in handy.

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:09.176
William. Boy, what you didn't
like my accommodation?

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:12.080
You accommodations were fine, it's
the hosts we're not happy with.

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:13.515
Shut it down.

01:09:13.515 --> 01:09:16.718
Oh no, you're not serious.
Not after all your hard work

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:18.653
Shut it down!

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.321
And if I don't?

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:24.160
This device shoots a beam that
will instantly incapacitate it.

01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:27.761
Spoken like a true pacifist.

01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:30.599
You're bluffing. That's just
one of those dumb toys.

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:32.167
Try me.

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:35.303
Why do you wanna shut this down?

01:09:35.304 --> 01:09:37.840
I think you know very well why.
Why don't you tell them?

01:09:50.986 --> 01:09:52.854
Oh-Oh. Oh, God.

01:09:57.159 --> 01:09:58.760
Okay, okay.

01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:01.229
Can we have some help here?
Can we have some help here?

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:03.131
Can you take him?
Okay, here we go.

01:10:03.132 --> 01:10:05.300
You've weaponized humor?

01:10:05.301 --> 01:10:07.068
You think it'll work
with the North Koreans?

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:10.705
I love that toy.

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:13.174
As soon as we take apart this
plane, this thing is next.

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:16.845
Okay boys, you know the drill. Let's
hand everything, hand everything over.

01:10:19.615 --> 01:10:22.350
You're gonna destroy the world
and you don't even care.

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:24.953
We care, William, remember
why we're doing this.

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:27.355
We're doing this because I care.

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:30.258
Grid point lock,
transfer to commence.

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:31.727
It's show time!

01:10:34.496 --> 01:10:36.398
Increase power by ten percent.

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:41.904
Micron stabilizers in
three, two, one, mark.

01:11:14.903 --> 01:11:16.037
Is that...

01:11:16.038 --> 01:11:18.374
Is that... Is that the shadow?

01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:42.997
Oh, my God!

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:46.702
Perfect.

01:11:49.071 --> 01:11:50.838
Oh, God.

01:11:50.839 --> 01:11:52.007
Look, what we've done.

01:11:53.108 --> 01:11:55.544
This is... It's a miracle.

01:12:07.289 --> 01:12:09.557
- I know.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

01:12:09.558 --> 01:12:12.493
this is the most important
day of my life.

01:12:12.494 --> 01:12:16.598
Obviously, I could have
done this alone...

01:12:17.399 --> 01:12:19.834
I wanted to share
it with all of you.

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:24.440
I-I don't want your thanks, I don't
want your gratitude, I just...

01:12:25.874 --> 01:12:26.942
You're welcome.

01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:31.046
Clap! Clap!

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:34.582
All right, stop. Stop.

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:38.019
This plane, is the beginning

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.856
of a new world order.

01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:43.525
Nothing can stop us now.

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:50.064
Check it, check it please.

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:51.567
Where's my plane?

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.000
Where...

01:12:53.001 --> 01:12:54.902
Where's my plane? Franklin!

01:12:54.903 --> 01:12:56.070
Working on it, sir.

01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:58.239
What's going on? I want answers.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.774
I'll give you an answer.

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:01.776
Looks like our little
diversion worked.

01:13:01.777 --> 01:13:04.946
It allowed someone to affect your
cubits in your backup computer.

01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:06.415
I taught him well.

01:13:08.517 --> 01:13:10.853
I sent the plane back
to where it belongs.

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:27.602
Jenny, you are in so much trouble.
Take that mask from her.

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:31.105
Billy, it's time to
show them the truth.

01:13:31.106 --> 01:13:32.440
What's he doing? Stop him.

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:34.009
- No, no, no, no.
- Stop him.

01:13:37.713 --> 01:13:38.814
What the...

01:13:42.951 --> 01:13:45.853
December 25th, 25
years from now.

01:13:45.854 --> 01:13:48.957
Merry Christmas, the
day that time ends.

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:54.162
This is the reason our signals
can never go beyond that date.

01:13:54.163 --> 01:13:55.831
And you knew about it all along.

01:13:57.566 --> 01:14:01.169
But I can change it. I swear,
I can change the future.

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:02.970
You won't.

01:14:02.971 --> 01:14:06.508
You'll take the technology from the
Shadow and build and unstoppable army.

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:08.710
Look, where it gets you.

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:11.345
There's your precious future.

01:14:11.346 --> 01:14:13.715
Your ego and your greed
is destroying it.

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.466
-Oops, a little speed bump

01:14:26.478 --> 01:14:28.396
in the continuum. -What?

01:14:28.397 --> 01:14:30.631
Unable to initiate
remedy sequence.

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:33.502
I guess I deactivated the
remedy controls as well.

01:14:34.002 --> 01:14:36.003
What's going on?

01:14:36.004 --> 01:14:41.609
Gentlemen, I'd say that the Pandora Project
has just been officially canceled.

01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:45.146
Electrical surge to hit
in T minus 90 seconds.

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:46.881
Evacuate premises.

01:14:46.882 --> 01:14:48.516
You're dead.

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:50.618
If you stay, chances
are you will be too.

01:14:50.619 --> 01:14:52.520
Come on guys, let's
get outta here.

01:14:59.027 --> 01:15:02.064
Guys leave them, they don't
belong in this time.

01:15:06.969 --> 01:15:09.136
T-minus one minute.

01:15:09.137 --> 01:15:10.338
This is the only way out.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:12.406
You gotta jump it,
you can do it.

01:15:12.407 --> 01:15:14.643
- Okay.
- Okay, I'll go first.

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:17.779
We're running outta time.

01:15:21.316 --> 01:15:22.817
Nice.

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:23.918
Jump, Mel.

01:15:23.919 --> 01:15:25.187
Oh no, come on.

01:15:26.388 --> 01:15:28.557
Nice. You did it.

01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:30.424
You know, you go.

01:15:30.425 --> 01:15:32.493
Not till you're safely over.

01:15:32.494 --> 01:15:34.962
I can't. I can't do that.

01:15:34.963 --> 01:15:38.032
Yes you can. Just
don't look at it.

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:39.700
T-minus 30 seconds.

01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:42.303
You don't understand,
I need the shoes.

01:15:42.304 --> 01:15:45.773
You can do this. You don't
need the shoes anymore.

01:15:45.774 --> 01:15:48.543
The real power is
already inside of you.

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:50.244
You just have to trust yourself.

01:15:50.245 --> 01:15:51.712
You can do it.

01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:53.681
- Come on, Boomer, you got this.
- You can do this.

01:15:53.682 --> 01:15:55.249
You got this. Come on.

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:56.652
I can do this.

01:15:57.252 --> 01:15:58.587
You can do it.

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:06.929
Yes.

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:11.966
- I did it.
- You did it.

01:16:11.967 --> 01:16:14.069
Up the stairs, we
gotta get outta here.

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:17.505
Send it all back.

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:19.546
- 15, 14, 13, 12...
- I'm doing the

01:16:19.558 --> 01:16:21.610
best I can, there's
no one else here.

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:32.621
Six, five, four,
three, two, one...

01:16:33.288 --> 01:16:34.690
This is gonna hurt.

01:16:40.162 --> 01:16:41.395
Is it okay?

01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:44.967
A little help. Thank you.

01:16:47.469 --> 01:16:50.037
I think we did it.

01:16:50.038 --> 01:16:51.105
Yeah. Well, I hope so.

01:16:51.106 --> 01:16:53.342
'Cause I am definitely
not doing that again.

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:55.777
Only one way to find out.

01:17:09.925 --> 01:17:12.827
Welcome to Holopedia, 7.0,

01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:14.562
updated every year.

01:17:14.563 --> 01:17:16.197
Search Xircon Plaza.

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:19.433
Xircon Plaza was
canceled and never done.

01:17:19.434 --> 01:17:21.736
We did it! Yeah

01:17:21.737 --> 01:17:23.771
Okay, okay, okay.

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:26.574
Search American history,
25 years from today.

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:31.445
America 25 years from today, is
a rich and productive nation.

01:17:31.446 --> 01:17:33.314
Unemployment is
under two percent.

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:37.918
Crime is lowest in 25 years and the
democracy is stronger than ever.

01:17:37.919 --> 01:17:38.854
We did it.

01:17:38.855 --> 01:17:41.656
We actually saved the future.

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:45.593
Ladies and Gentlemen the Commander
and Chief of the United States.

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:47.294
Wait a minute,
that looks like...

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:48.529
It couldn't be.

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:49.964
It is.

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:51.098
Justin Beiber.

01:17:51.099 --> 01:17:52.900
Oh!

01:17:52.901 --> 01:17:55.671
Okay, maybe we didn't
save the future.

01:17:57.372 --> 01:17:58.806
Program interrupt.

01:17:58.807 --> 01:18:01.109
Stand by for
pre-recorded message.

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:08.883
Hello. This is a pre-recorded message
from 25 years in the future.

01:18:08.884 --> 01:18:12.887
If you've come this far, I can safely
assume everything is all right.

01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:15.056
So congratulations Matt,

01:18:15.057 --> 01:18:21.696
Eddie, Boomer, Mel,
Jenny, and Wizz.

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:24.032
Matt, if I look familiar
to you, I should.

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:25.701
I'm you.

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:29.737
And here's another
shocker, you have a son.

01:18:29.738 --> 01:18:33.641
He plays with the daughter of a man who
runs an Air Force Storage facility.

01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:35.776
The one, Weller tried
to take the plane from.

01:18:35.777 --> 01:18:39.948
I changed the password on that chest near
the plane to something we always said.

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:45.052
And then I told my son to take the
plans out and keeps his toys in there.

01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:46.687
Just in case.

01:18:46.688 --> 01:18:49.123
Matt, I've wondered what
I would say to you.

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:51.960
I could tell you all
about myself but...

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:54.562
why ruin the surprises.

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:58.799
I guess I just wanna tell all of
you, what you already know by now.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.569
You're destiny isn't
written in stone.

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:03.738
You don't have to be zeros,

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:06.640
so go out there and make
your dreams come true.

01:19:06.641 --> 01:19:08.275
Matt, are you coming?

01:19:08.276 --> 01:19:09.945
Yeah, just a minute honey.

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:15.416
Well, I gotta go now. Good luck.

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:18.920
Oh, and don't see
Transformers 18, it sucks.

01:19:19.454 --> 01:19:21.288
Sure, it does.

01:19:21.289 --> 01:19:24.525
Oh I forgot, I installed the
self-destruct in this program

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:26.962
just in case it ever fell
into the wrong hands.

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:29.931
So long.

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:42.309
Wow, that's heavy.

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:43.845
Meeting your future self.

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:46.915
Yeah but, that woman's voice,

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:49.518
it sounded so familiar.

Hey, guys, later tonight, I'm picking
up Jenny, and heading to the mall.

01:20:45.207 --> 01:20:46.141
Anyone wanna come?

01:20:46.142 --> 01:20:47.741
Can't, I'm studying for math.

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:49.510
I'm pulling up the uni-files.

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:52.713
Sorry, I have track, I'm
trying out for the long jump.

01:20:52.714 --> 01:20:55.851
And I've got my, "Stand up for kids"
meeting today, maybe tomorrow?

01:20:57.652 --> 01:21:00.454
Whoa guys, that's
the Xircon car.

01:21:00.455 --> 01:21:02.390
But Xircon went outta business.

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:10.965
Anyone up for a little Pac Man?

01:21:10.966 --> 01:21:13.100
Wizz! How you doing?

01:21:13.101 --> 01:21:16.103
You're looking at the new CEO
of Xircon, thanks to you.

01:21:16.104 --> 01:21:18.505
I'm taking this company
in a whole new direction.

01:21:18.506 --> 01:21:23.077
We reassembled the machine and
got a signal, from the future.

01:21:23.078 --> 01:21:24.245
Something's coming here.

01:21:24.246 --> 01:21:26.448
I need your help. Can
you come right now?

01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:28.416
Let's do it.

01:21:28.817 --> 01:21:30.251
Follow me.

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:31.319
Go ahead.
