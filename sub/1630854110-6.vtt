00:04.395 --> 00:06.310
<i>Dr. Ben Song
risked everything</i>

00:06.354 --> 00:08.704
<i>when he used the
Quantum Leap Accelerator</i>

00:08.747 --> 00:10.619
<i>to travel back in time.</i>

00:10.662 --> 00:13.187
<i>Now, our team's working
to find out why</i>

00:13.230 --> 00:16.538
<i>as he leaps between bodies
with no memory of who he is...</i>

00:16.581 --> 00:19.149
<i>He still has one hope...</i>

00:19.193 --> 00:21.499
<i>that his next leap</i>

00:21.543 --> 00:25.155
<i>takes him back to the place</i>

00:25.199 --> 00:29.072
<i>and people he calls home.</i>

00:32.641 --> 00:34.121
Look, it's kinda
like our first date.

00:34.164 --> 00:37.037
Totally.
It's--it's exactly like that.

00:37.080 --> 00:40.779
I may not remember
the specifics,

00:40.823 --> 00:42.651
but I remember how I feel,

00:42.694 --> 00:45.523
and how much I care about you, Addison,

00:45.567 --> 00:48.483
and that I'll do anything
to find my way back to you

00:48.526 --> 00:53.879
so we could start over,
build new memories together.

00:55.751 --> 00:59.102
There's nothing I want
more than that, Ben.

00:59.146 --> 01:00.669
Is it possible
to kiss a hologram?

01:00.712 --> 01:02.366
Because I really want to
right now.

01:03.759 --> 01:04.803
Whoa.

01:04.847 --> 01:06.196
You made a serious miscalculation

01:06.240 --> 01:07.763
coming here, Ben.

01:07.806 --> 01:09.547
- Did he just call you Ben?
- How did you know my name?

01:09.591 --> 01:11.201
I know everything about you,

01:11.245 --> 01:13.943
Dr. Ben Song
from the year 2022.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.553
I know what you're doing.

01:15.597 --> 01:18.600
But if you value your life,
you need to stop following me.

01:18.643 --> 01:20.167
Do you understand?

01:25.433 --> 01:26.564
Did you just see that?

01:26.608 --> 01:28.392
Did someone just
recognize Ben?

01:28.436 --> 01:29.785
- How?
- They knew his name.

01:29.828 --> 01:32.266
They literally called him
Dr. Ben Song from 2022.

01:32.309 --> 01:33.832
I was more concerned with the

01:33.876 --> 01:35.095
"stop following me if you know
what's good for you" part.

01:35.138 --> 01:37.793
How is this possible?

01:37.836 --> 01:40.187
May--maybe they're
another time traveler.

01:40.230 --> 01:41.231
No.

01:41.275 --> 01:42.711
Another leaper,

01:42.754 --> 01:44.147
someone else traveling
through time just like Ben.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.670
Another leaper?

01:45.714 --> 01:47.150
If they're using technology
that's similar to ours,

01:47.194 --> 01:48.934
then they would see Ben as Ben,

01:48.978 --> 01:51.285
the exact same way that we do
in the imaging chamber.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.548
It's the only explanation.
- Similar technology?

01:53.591 --> 01:55.245
Uh, this is
a one-of-a-kind setup.

01:55.289 --> 01:57.073
That we know of.

01:57.117 --> 02:01.382
Okay, is this why Ben leapt?
To follow this person?

02:01.425 --> 02:03.775
Follow them where?
A-and why?

02:03.819 --> 02:06.126
And what is going on?

02:08.258 --> 02:10.565
When I was a kid
and my parents broke up,

02:10.608 --> 02:12.915
I blamed my mom.

02:12.958 --> 02:15.309
Probably because I barely
saw my dad after that.

02:15.352 --> 02:19.313
And she was the only one
still around to be mad at.

02:19.356 --> 02:20.705
You know, I--

02:20.749 --> 02:23.360
I took the job at St. Luke's
because I--

02:23.404 --> 02:26.363
I thought it would
make our lives better.

02:26.407 --> 02:28.626
We've been stuck in a rut
for a long time.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.933
I--I thought
maybe a change of venue,

02:30.976 --> 02:32.195
some more money in our pockets,
but--

02:32.239 --> 02:33.588
Hey!

02:33.631 --> 02:36.025
But it didn't.

02:36.068 --> 02:39.071
John, are you even
listening to me?

02:39.115 --> 02:40.812
Um.
Sorry.

02:40.856 --> 02:43.902
Uh, yes.

02:43.946 --> 02:46.992
We're in San Francisco, right?

02:47.036 --> 02:48.516
I get it.

02:48.559 --> 02:51.345
You didn't wanna move here.
You've made that very clear.

02:51.388 --> 02:52.433
I tried, John.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.261
I went to therapy,

02:54.304 --> 02:58.308
I--I changed my hours
to better suit your--

02:58.352 --> 03:00.615
I've been killing myself
trying to make this work.

03:00.658 --> 03:03.139
But I--I--I can't.
I can't do it anymore.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.576
I want a divorce.

03:05.620 --> 03:08.623
Oh.

03:08.666 --> 03:10.712
From me?

03:10.755 --> 03:13.193
Please don't joke
or be dismissive right now.

03:13.236 --> 03:14.672
I'm not--

03:14.716 --> 03:16.761
<i>The Battle
of the Bay continues.</i>

03:16.805 --> 03:19.721
<i>Game Three
of the 1989 World Series,</i>

03:19.764 --> 03:22.854
<i>the Oakland Athletics against
the San Francisco Giants.</i>

03:22.898 --> 03:25.030
<i>I'm Al Michaels--</i>
- Wait a minute.

03:25.074 --> 03:26.641
What year is it?

03:26.684 --> 03:27.859
1989.

03:27.903 --> 03:30.688
John, did you hear
anything I just said?

03:30.732 --> 03:32.386
I don't think I can be married
to you anymore.

03:32.429 --> 03:34.866
They're not gonna play.
This game got canceled.

03:34.910 --> 03:37.521
We need to go.
We need to go, now.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.262
No, no.
We need to talk.

03:39.306 --> 03:40.524
You can't keep running--

03:40.568 --> 03:42.700
Everything is about
to collapse around us.

03:42.744 --> 03:45.007
It already has.
I'm done, John.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.530
And if you're not gonna
fight for us any--

03:46.574 --> 03:47.749
Please, we need to go, okay?

03:47.792 --> 03:49.533
We need to go.

03:49.577 --> 03:51.361
Everybody, we need
to get out of here, now!

04:15.951 --> 04:18.258
- Holy--
- I got you!

04:19.737 --> 04:22.827
Look out!

04:30.182 --> 04:31.314
It's over.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.272
- Oh, my God!
- It's okay, ma'am.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.969
Thank God!

04:36.058 --> 04:37.494
Are you okay?

04:37.538 --> 04:39.322
Yeah, I think so.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.759
Are you?

04:41.803 --> 04:43.370
Yeah.

04:43.413 --> 04:45.502
How did you know
that was gonna happen?

04:45.546 --> 04:47.243
I don't know.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.419
I just...

04:49.463 --> 04:51.639
remembered it.

04:51.682 --> 04:54.119
My husband's been hurt bad!

04:54.163 --> 04:56.992
Somebody, my husband!

04:57.035 --> 04:58.820
It's okay, it's okay.

04:58.863 --> 05:01.083
Hey, I'm a doctor.
My name's Naomi.

05:01.126 --> 05:03.041
Let me take a look.

05:03.085 --> 05:05.305
I'll try and find help!

05:16.228 --> 05:18.622
Stop!
Hey, stop!

05:18.666 --> 05:20.363
Please, we have injured
down the street.

05:20.407 --> 05:21.973
You gotta get to them.
- On it.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.934
- Hey.
- Oh, thank God.

05:25.977 --> 05:28.066
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

05:28.110 --> 05:29.372
Are you okay?

05:29.416 --> 05:30.765
Who was that guy
at Salvation?

05:30.808 --> 05:32.810
He recognized me.
You saw that, right?

05:32.854 --> 05:36.771
Yeah, I--we think
he's another leaper.

05:36.814 --> 05:40.078
Another leaper? Like another
person leaping through time?

05:40.122 --> 05:41.079
How is that possible?

05:41.123 --> 05:42.951
Uh, we don't know yet.

05:42.994 --> 05:45.040
Look, there's a lot of
things we don't understand.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.389
Well, that's comforting.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.696
Look, the entire team
is on it.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.915
Is this why I left in the
first place, to follow them?

05:50.959 --> 05:52.090
We're asking
the same questions.

05:52.134 --> 05:54.658
But--and you're
not gonna like this,

05:54.702 --> 05:56.834
but you can't focus
on that right now.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.836
How could I possibly
think about anything else?

05:58.880 --> 06:01.491
You have to focus
on this leap.

06:01.535 --> 06:02.753
Let us worry about
the last one.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.320
I know, I know.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.801
But if you don't keep
making it through these leaps,

06:06.844 --> 06:08.933
you will get stuck in the past.

06:08.977 --> 06:10.021
Okay?

06:10.065 --> 06:13.677
Please, for me, for you.

06:13.721 --> 06:16.419
Let's just focus on this one.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.855
Okay.
All right.

06:17.899 --> 06:19.727
Uh... <i></i>

06:19.770 --> 06:21.337
Hey.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.253
Okay, it looks like Ziggy says
you jumped into John Harvey?

06:24.296 --> 06:27.256
Yeah, from what I can tell,
not the greatest dude.

06:27.299 --> 06:28.692
Any idea why I'm here?

06:28.736 --> 06:30.215
I'm having a hard time
getting a reading.

06:30.259 --> 06:32.435
Well, his--his wife
asked me for a divorce,

06:32.479 --> 06:34.306
justifiably it sounds like.

06:34.350 --> 06:35.699
But I can't be
here to fix that.

06:35.743 --> 06:37.092
- Uh--
- John.

06:37.135 --> 06:38.876
Oh.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.965
- Oh, ambulance got to you?
- Yeah. I got him stabilized.

06:41.009 --> 06:42.053
He's on his way
to the hospital.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.446
Come on.

06:43.490 --> 06:44.447
We have to get home and
make sure Jason's okay.

06:44.491 --> 06:45.579
Jason?

06:45.622 --> 06:47.711
- Our son?
- Yeah. Oh, our son.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.452
I love Jason so much.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.193
Where's--where--
you lead the way.

06:52.499 --> 06:53.543
Okay.

06:53.587 --> 06:54.544
I gotta switch
his handlink out.

06:54.588 --> 06:55.502
I'll meet you at the house.

07:02.726 --> 07:05.903
This handlink's messed up.

07:05.947 --> 07:07.514
I'll run diagnostics on it,

07:07.557 --> 07:11.343
but you can use an old version
in the meantime.

07:11.387 --> 07:12.736
Hey. <i></i>

07:12.780 --> 07:14.129
- I know.
- Nice.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.478
What do you have
on the new leaper?

07:15.522 --> 07:18.089
Well, we are
calling them Leaper X.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.613
No, we are not.

07:19.656 --> 07:20.614
It was worth a shot.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.050
So it's been 12 hours.

07:22.093 --> 07:23.747
What do we think
is happening here?

07:23.791 --> 07:25.270
And I want this
in plain English, please.

07:25.314 --> 07:28.012
So we're looking at
three possible scenarios.

07:28.056 --> 07:29.753
Number one,
a foreign government

07:29.797 --> 07:31.320
somehow got a hold
of the schematics

07:31.363 --> 07:33.322
for the quantum leap machine
and built one of their own.

07:33.365 --> 07:34.976
Unlikely.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.281
I feel like the CIA would've
at least picked up chatter

07:36.325 --> 07:37.587
and let me know.
- Yeah.

07:37.631 --> 07:38.893
And for what it's worth,

07:38.936 --> 07:40.416
the other leaper
was using an American accent.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.722
Fair point.

07:41.765 --> 07:43.593
So scenario number two,

07:43.637 --> 07:45.465
a private company
is behind this.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.162
Some billionaire
or defense contractor

07:47.205 --> 07:48.946
got enough pieces
of this shared with them

07:48.990 --> 07:51.122
and can now travel
through time.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.951
Elon Musk or Zuck
being able to control the past?

07:53.995 --> 07:56.171
Ugh.
That's terrifying.

07:56.214 --> 07:58.434
We made sure that
no single contractor

07:58.478 --> 08:01.611
had the plans for this facility
when we were constructing it.

08:01.655 --> 08:04.005
We took every effort
to make sure no one knew

08:04.048 --> 08:05.528
what we were building
down here.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.312
But it is possible.

08:07.356 --> 08:11.621
Scenario number three,
and this is a real mind... cuss.

08:11.665 --> 08:13.144
So full warning.

08:13.188 --> 08:14.668
Already don't like it.

08:14.711 --> 08:17.627
Someone's using our facility
to leap.

08:17.671 --> 08:19.934
No.
That's not possible.

08:19.977 --> 08:21.370
Right?

08:21.413 --> 08:22.937
We would've gotten an alert,
like when Ben jumped.

08:22.980 --> 08:26.549
No, we wouldn't, not if
they're using it in the future.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.029
Wait.
So you're saying--

08:28.072 --> 08:29.552
We don't know
who's controlling the program

08:29.596 --> 08:31.511
five years from now,
ten years from now,

08:31.554 --> 08:32.990
50 years from now.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.166
The person you ran into
may not have jumped yet,

08:35.210 --> 08:37.299
but will in the future.

08:37.342 --> 08:38.561
This makes my head hurt.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.389
Yeah.
You are not the only one.

08:40.432 --> 08:43.566
I don't want theories.
I don't want scenarios.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.481
You have access to
the most powerful

08:45.525 --> 08:47.483
quantum computer in the world.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.704
I want to know what we're
really dealing with here, now.

08:54.142 --> 08:56.274
Jason?

08:56.318 --> 08:58.276
Jason?
He's not here.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.235
Let me check Brandon's house.

09:02.846 --> 09:05.370
Well, they <i>look</i> happy.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.024
They are not.

09:07.068 --> 09:08.983
Sounds like this has
been coming for a while,

09:09.026 --> 09:10.332
irreconcilable differences.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.552
I can't imagine I'm here
to save their marriage.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.336
I know.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.947
Any word from the brain trust?

09:16.991 --> 09:20.342
Lot of theories,
not a lot of answers.

09:20.385 --> 09:22.039
Cool.

09:28.611 --> 09:31.266
Oh, this has me...

09:34.617 --> 09:37.098
Are my parents still together?

09:42.625 --> 09:47.543
Are they alive?

09:47.587 --> 09:50.241
I'm sorry, Ben.

09:50.285 --> 09:53.897
Uh, you didn't really have
a relationship with your dad.

09:53.941 --> 09:55.856
Your mom raised you.

09:55.899 --> 10:00.338
She brought you to the States
when you were nine.

10:00.382 --> 10:03.124
Honestly, you didn't
really talk about her much.

10:03.167 --> 10:08.433
All I know is that she died
when you were in high school.

10:08.477 --> 10:10.348
Ben.

10:18.313 --> 10:19.662
I remember her.

10:19.706 --> 10:22.404
Really?

10:22.447 --> 10:24.754
What do you remember?

10:24.798 --> 10:28.628
Her cooking.

10:28.671 --> 10:31.456
The smell is...

10:31.500 --> 10:33.328
so comforting.

10:35.635 --> 10:39.290
Feeling safe.

10:39.334 --> 10:42.337
Feeling so safe.

10:48.648 --> 10:52.564
That's it.

10:55.829 --> 10:58.222
I never talk about her?

10:58.266 --> 11:01.138
No.

11:01.182 --> 11:02.705
There were a lot
of things about you

11:02.749 --> 11:06.535
that were still
a mystery to me.

11:06.578 --> 11:09.494
I'm sorry for adding more.

11:11.888 --> 11:14.543
Are you close
with your parents?

11:14.586 --> 11:19.156
Um, it's complicated.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.984
Probably would take longer
to catch you up

11:21.028 --> 11:22.682
than we have time for.

11:25.336 --> 11:27.556
They're both still alive, though.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.344
Okay.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.176
You think Jason tore this up?

11:39.220 --> 11:41.091
Well, his parents <i>
are</i> getting divorced.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.353
I mean, can you blame him?

11:42.397 --> 11:43.703
Yeah, but I get
the sense from Naomi

11:43.746 --> 11:45.922
she hadn't told anyone.

11:45.966 --> 11:47.532
Addison, where's this kid?

11:52.799 --> 11:55.062
Oh, no.

11:55.105 --> 11:58.761
Jason Harvey died in the
aftermath of the earthquake.

11:58.805 --> 12:01.111
Ben, that's what
you're here to do.

12:01.155 --> 12:03.984
You have to save Jason.

12:10.599 --> 12:12.296
- We have their photo.
- What?

12:12.340 --> 12:13.384
Leaper X.

12:13.428 --> 12:14.951
We're not calling them that.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.387
I know.
But we have their photo.

12:16.431 --> 12:17.954
I pulled it from
the imaging chamber feed.

12:17.998 --> 12:19.347
How is that possible?

12:19.390 --> 12:20.957
I thought you might ask.
Can you come downstairs?

12:21.001 --> 12:23.133
I set up some props
to make this less brain hurt-y.

12:23.177 --> 12:26.093
You--

12:28.008 --> 12:29.400
So where'd you get those?

12:29.444 --> 12:31.141
Maduka has got
a whole diorama thing

12:31.185 --> 12:32.316
going on in his office.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.362
It started off
kinda small and fun,

12:34.405 --> 12:35.929
but it's ballooned
into this whole thing

12:35.972 --> 12:37.495
where I think we're all just
kinda worried about him now.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.149
Stay on target, Jen.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.195
Right. Sorry. Okay.

12:41.238 --> 12:43.719
So this represents
one of our hosts,

12:43.763 --> 12:45.242
one of the people
Ben leaps into.

12:45.286 --> 12:49.638
On his last leap,
he was Diego de La Cruz.

12:49.681 --> 12:50.857
Okay.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.380
So to the world,
Ben's walking around,

12:52.423 --> 12:54.295
and he still looks like Diego, right?

12:54.338 --> 12:55.731
Even to Ben.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.081
When Ben looks in the mirror,
it's Diego he sees.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.256
Jen, I know all this.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.344
I'm building to a thing, Magic.

13:00.388 --> 13:01.998
Build faster.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.695
Okay.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.697
So we can monitor Ben
in the past

13:05.741 --> 13:07.090
through the imaging chamber here

13:07.134 --> 13:09.658
because of the way
the imaging chamber feed works,

13:09.701 --> 13:11.878
when Addison is in there,
she doesn't see Diego.

13:11.921 --> 13:15.925
She sees Ben as Ben.

13:15.969 --> 13:17.971
Got it?
- Yes, of course.

13:18.014 --> 13:21.975
So is the cowboy, the host
our other leaper jumped into.

13:22.018 --> 13:24.542
To the outside world,
they look like the cowboy.

13:24.586 --> 13:27.197
But if they're using quantum
leap technology like ours,

13:27.241 --> 13:29.591
when we see them
in the imaging chamber--

13:29.634 --> 13:31.593
We wouldn't see the cowboy.

13:31.636 --> 13:33.813
We'd see them,
what they actually look like.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.597
I mean,
that's my theory at least.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.120
And if we know
what they look like--

13:37.164 --> 13:39.819
We can run their photo scan
through the NSA databases,

13:39.862 --> 13:40.732
see if we get a hit.

13:40.776 --> 13:43.735
And put a name to the face.

13:43.779 --> 13:45.215
Nice work.

13:45.259 --> 13:46.521
Ian!

13:46.564 --> 13:48.262
Look,
I don't wanna scare you,

13:48.305 --> 13:50.568
but basically
everyone who's alive

13:50.612 --> 13:52.919
has an image of their face
in one database or another.

13:52.962 --> 13:54.877
I mean, we're practically
doing it to ourselves.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.661
If we're lucky,
we'll get a hit from a DMV

13:56.705 --> 13:59.229
or something that shows up
with a lot of additional info.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.014
But worst case scenario,
we get a hit,

14:01.057 --> 14:03.103
we at least know that they're
not far off in the future.

14:03.146 --> 14:06.280
I just can't get my mind
around a private company

14:06.323 --> 14:08.064
running its own
quantum leap program.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.674
It would be very, very bad.

14:15.463 --> 14:16.768
You do realize that this

14:16.812 --> 14:18.031
could take, like, a week, right?

14:18.074 --> 14:19.467
A week?

14:19.510 --> 14:21.469
There are hundreds
of thousands of databases.

14:21.512 --> 14:23.427
I mean,
this is trillions of images

14:23.471 --> 14:24.951
that it has to sort through
and compare.

14:24.994 --> 14:26.822
- I can't wait that long.
- God.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.868
Sometimes I wish Ben were here
to explain to you

14:28.911 --> 14:30.521
how amazing
what I'm doing is

14:30.565 --> 14:31.609
and how it can't be rushed.

14:31.653 --> 14:32.741
It's gonna take
what it's gonna--

14:32.784 --> 14:36.571
Take.

14:36.614 --> 14:38.268
We have a hit.
How did you do that?

14:38.312 --> 14:40.140
- Magic.
- Okay.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.576
Whoa.
We got a lot here.

14:41.619 --> 14:44.448
Richard Martinez,
he's a Marine, pretty new one.

14:44.492 --> 14:46.755
Did one tour,
won a <i>bunch</i> of medals,

14:46.798 --> 14:48.409
stationed in Camp Pendleton.

14:48.452 --> 14:52.195
That's right down the road
from here.

14:52.239 --> 14:53.980
Are you sure he is--he's--

14:54.023 --> 14:55.068
Say it.

14:55.111 --> 14:57.592
You know you wanna say it.

14:57.635 --> 15:00.812
Are you sure he's Leaper X?

15:00.856 --> 15:02.640
Well, unless he swapped faces
with someone in the past,

15:02.684 --> 15:04.860
then, yes, this is 100% him.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.122
Call Pendleton.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.471
I want to know
where this guy is right now.

15:07.515 --> 15:09.125
- On it.
- Pull Addison.

15:09.169 --> 15:12.433
I want her to confirm this
is the guy she saw in there.

15:15.044 --> 15:16.524
We got him to say it.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.134
How are we supposed
to find him

15:18.178 --> 15:19.396
in the middle of an earthquake?

15:19.440 --> 15:21.659
We don't even know
if he's still alive.

15:21.703 --> 15:22.922
Ian, where we are we at
with Ziggy?

15:22.965 --> 15:24.880
Ziggy said
there's a 93% chance

15:24.924 --> 15:26.621
that Ben is there
to save Jason,

15:26.664 --> 15:28.318
so he must still be alive.

15:28.362 --> 15:30.494
And I'll dive into the records
and see if I can find out more.

15:30.538 --> 15:32.714
But Addison, we're gonna
need you to step out.

15:32.757 --> 15:35.325
We think we have our guy ID'd. <i>
- Okay. Stand by.</i>

15:36.761 --> 15:39.286
Hey, Brandon just told
me he spoke with Jason

15:39.329 --> 15:41.853
two hours ago,
and he was really upset,

15:41.897 --> 15:43.638
that he wanted to go home.
But he didn't come back.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.161
Did he?
- No.

15:45.205 --> 15:47.555
This doesn't make any sense.
Where would he have gone?

15:47.598 --> 15:50.732
I don't know,
but look at this.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.995
Is there any way he could've
found out about the divorce?

15:53.039 --> 15:56.694
Oh, my God.

15:56.738 --> 15:59.871
I was on the phone
this morning with a lawyer.

15:59.915 --> 16:04.006
He must've overheard me.
This is my fault.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.661
He's out there alone.
He could be hurt.

16:06.704 --> 16:08.924
He could be--
- Hey, hey.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.187
I know you're scared.
I am, too.

16:11.231 --> 16:14.538
But we're not gonna let
anything happen to him, okay?

16:14.582 --> 16:18.368
Do you have any idea
where he would go?

16:18.412 --> 16:19.543
I don't know.

16:19.587 --> 16:20.849
Come on, Naomi. Think.

16:20.892 --> 16:22.720
He must have a favorite place
in the city.

16:22.764 --> 16:24.722
Well, you would know better
than I would.

16:24.766 --> 16:28.030
Since we've moved,
he's been so distant with me.

16:28.074 --> 16:31.425
We--we moved from Oakland.
That's why he's an A's fan.

16:31.468 --> 16:32.730
What are you saying?

16:32.774 --> 16:34.167
Brandon said Jason
wanted to go home.

16:34.210 --> 16:37.387
This picture of us,
that was from our old place.

16:37.431 --> 16:39.215
Maybe that's where he's going.

16:39.259 --> 16:40.564
It makes sense.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.175
We were so happy there,

16:42.218 --> 16:44.046
and he always says
how much he misses it.

16:44.090 --> 16:46.353
Ben, Ian just forwarded me
public records.

16:46.396 --> 16:47.528
The Harveys' old apartment building

16:47.571 --> 16:48.485
collapsed in the quake.

16:48.529 --> 16:51.010
It went down at 7:34 p.m.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.446
That's an hour and a half
from now.

16:52.489 --> 16:54.448
Oakland's that way.
- We gotta go, now.

16:54.491 --> 16:55.927
But it's across the Bay.
How are we gonna get there?

16:55.971 --> 16:57.668
- Working on it.
- Uh, bridge is down.

16:57.712 --> 16:59.061
Ferries and trains
aren't running either.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.541
But the BART does run
under the Bay.

17:00.584 --> 17:02.064
Are you crazy?
We can't take the BART.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.761
I didn't say anything
about the BART.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.198
But there's an
auxiliary tunnel that

17:05.241 --> 17:06.503
runs parallel to the tracks.

17:06.547 --> 17:09.028
You can walk it.
- We can walk it. Come on.

17:09.071 --> 17:10.420
You just said
you didn't want to.

17:10.464 --> 17:11.943
I was convinced otherwise.

17:11.987 --> 17:13.902
All right.
Let's just get there.

17:13.945 --> 17:15.251
Ben, I have to check
on something.

17:15.295 --> 17:16.557
I'll be back as soon as I can.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.124
Be careful.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.997
<i>Power outages
and wire services</i>

17:22.041 --> 17:23.564
<i>are now coming in
with other reports.</i>

17:23.607 --> 17:25.305
<i>The entire upper deck,</i>

17:25.348 --> 17:27.307
<i>it just seemed to collapse
during the shaking.</i>

17:27.350 --> 17:28.612
<i>Getting reports now that</i>

17:28.656 --> 17:29.744
<i>at least 50 people
are dead tonight.</i>

17:38.405 --> 17:40.929
Whoa.
Yeah, that's him.

17:40.972 --> 17:42.583
Who is he?

17:42.626 --> 17:45.281
Sergeant Richard Martinez.
He's a Marine out at Pendleton.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.240
- He's currently on leave.
- That's convenient.

17:47.283 --> 17:48.415
The CO's pretty sure

17:48.458 --> 17:49.807
he's visiting his mom in
El Cerrito.

17:49.851 --> 17:50.939
You have an address?

17:50.982 --> 17:53.028
I'm hurt you had to ask.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.986
We're gonna go talk
to this guy.

17:55.030 --> 17:56.336
He'd been on mission,
he still needs

17:56.379 --> 17:57.728
to leap at the end of this.

17:57.772 --> 18:00.601
Yeah. He's good.
He's remembering more.

18:00.644 --> 18:03.430
Good, 'cause whether it's Ben
or this Martinez guy,

18:03.473 --> 18:07.129
someone is gonna tell me what
the hell is going on, <i>today.</i>

18:14.136 --> 18:16.660
<i>It Is 6:30 p.m., dark.</i>

18:16.704 --> 18:20.751
<i>Power, phones, water is out
around San Francisco.</i>

18:20.795 --> 18:24.146
<i>Emergency crews are trying
to look for victims.</i>

18:24.190 --> 18:26.801
<i>We have one report,
KRON Television,</i>

18:26.844 --> 18:29.282
<i>saying that 53 people
are dead on the bridge.</i>

18:29.325 --> 18:30.761
Pretty sure
it's the same time as it was

18:30.805 --> 18:33.112
when you checked your watch
ten seconds ago.

18:36.593 --> 18:39.553
Are we really not
gonna talk about this?

18:39.596 --> 18:41.424
About what?

18:41.468 --> 18:43.557
Oakland.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.994
You can say it.
We never should've left.

18:46.037 --> 18:48.431
I promise
I wasn't gonna say that.

18:48.475 --> 18:50.868
No, but it is
what you're thinking.

18:50.912 --> 18:52.870
I'm the one who wanted to move.

18:52.914 --> 18:54.524
I thought the job
at St. Luke's

18:54.568 --> 18:57.832
was gonna be great
for all of us.

18:57.875 --> 19:00.922
It got us into a better place,
Jason into a better school.

19:00.965 --> 19:03.185
You know how smart he is.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.187
But all he saw
was leaving his--

19:05.231 --> 19:07.711
his friends, his home,
his life.

19:07.929 --> 19:09.322
I don't wanna be here!

19:09.365 --> 19:10.888
Come back.

19:11.976 --> 19:14.588
And he resents you for it.

19:14.631 --> 19:17.286
- Maybe I made a mistake.
- No.

19:17.330 --> 19:19.419
You did what you thought
was best for this family.

19:21.421 --> 19:24.424
You're a good mom.
I can see that.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.861
Am I?

19:26.904 --> 19:30.212
I work all the time.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.605
I barely see the two of you.

19:31.648 --> 19:36.349
And--and when I do,
Jason's so angry with me.

19:36.392 --> 19:40.135
And now, with this--
this divorce,

19:40.179 --> 19:43.530
I'm afraid
he's gonna hate me forever.

19:46.707 --> 19:49.275
Somebody, help us!

19:53.583 --> 19:55.498
Okay, if he's working
for a third party,

19:55.542 --> 19:56.891
how do you wanna play this?

19:56.934 --> 19:58.675
I wanna grab him by the
collar and start yelling,

19:58.719 --> 20:01.548
"Are you illegally
leaping through time?"

20:01.591 --> 20:04.725
Magic, rare moment
of sarcasm for you.

20:04.768 --> 20:06.335
I dig it.

20:06.379 --> 20:08.250
I think our only play here
is to get him talking,

20:08.294 --> 20:09.599
see what we can find out.

20:09.643 --> 20:12.385
Got it.
Good cop, good cop.

20:12.428 --> 20:13.821
Something like that.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.870
- Can I help you?
- Hello. Richard Martinez?

20:19.914 --> 20:21.220
Yes.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.526
Admiral Herbert Williams.
I hope it's okay.

20:23.570 --> 20:26.355
Your CO gave me
your home address.

20:26.399 --> 20:27.748
Come in, sir.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.576
In for what?

20:29.619 --> 20:31.360
Whatever.

20:31.404 --> 20:33.580
I--I don't understand.

20:33.623 --> 20:35.495
Sir, an admiral just showed
up at my doorstep unannounced

20:35.538 --> 20:37.845
in plain clothes
with a real serious vibe.

20:37.888 --> 20:40.151
This is about some special ops
or secret mission,

20:40.195 --> 20:41.892
you had me at hello.

20:41.936 --> 20:42.937
I'm in, sir.

20:42.980 --> 20:44.765
Well, I appreciate that.

20:44.808 --> 20:47.115
But that's not what--

20:47.158 --> 20:49.117
may we come in?

20:49.160 --> 20:50.423
Yeah.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.650
Really, Mrs. Martinez,

21:00.694 --> 21:02.652
thank you,
but we're not hungry.

21:02.696 --> 21:04.872
Oh, that won't stop her, sir.

21:07.222 --> 21:09.398
Gracias.

21:09.442 --> 21:11.139
Can we ask you
some questions?

21:11.182 --> 21:12.358
Of course.

21:12.401 --> 21:13.707
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I didn't catch your name.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.143
I didn't drop it.

21:15.186 --> 21:17.319
You got an impressive folder, Sergeant.

21:17.363 --> 21:18.451
Is there a medal
or commendation

21:18.494 --> 21:19.713
they haven't given you yet?

21:19.756 --> 21:21.889
Yes, ma'am.
There are many.

21:21.932 --> 21:24.195
That was sarcasm, Martinez.

21:24.239 --> 21:27.634
I detected that. Yes.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.113
We don't pay you enough,
do we?

21:29.157 --> 21:30.376
Sir?

21:30.419 --> 21:32.203
Considering the risk
you have to take,

21:32.247 --> 21:34.945
constantly putting your life
on the line,

21:34.989 --> 21:37.165
you're not even
clearing six figures.

21:37.208 --> 21:38.601
I'm fairly compensated, sir.

21:38.645 --> 21:40.168
Money is not my
main motivation.

21:40.211 --> 21:43.824
Then what is?

21:43.867 --> 21:47.480
My parents came here
from Mérida when I was nine.

21:47.523 --> 21:49.786
My brothers were six and seven.

21:49.830 --> 21:54.182
The risk we took
just to get here--

21:54.225 --> 21:56.358
this country gave us stability,

21:56.402 --> 22:00.014
gave us safety,
gave us a good living.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.842
I'm sorry.

22:01.885 --> 22:04.192
I still get emotional
just thinking about it.

22:04.235 --> 22:05.802
That's why you joined?

22:05.846 --> 22:06.934
Ma'am,
I joined for the one thing

22:06.977 --> 22:11.373
America didn't give me:
citizenship.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.462
I love this country.

22:13.506 --> 22:15.508
I wanna stay,
I wanna vote.

22:15.551 --> 22:16.552
I wanna protect it
from enemies,

22:16.596 --> 22:18.162
both foreign and domestic.

22:18.206 --> 22:20.382
So if there's a mission
that needs me, I'm in, sir.

22:20.426 --> 22:21.818
No questions asked.

22:21.862 --> 22:25.692
Just point me
in the right direction.

22:25.735 --> 22:29.260
It's forbidden to moonlight
during active service.

22:29.304 --> 22:30.610
You're aware of that, right?

22:30.653 --> 22:32.089
Ma'am?

22:32.133 --> 22:34.527
You can't rent yourself out
to private companies,

22:34.570 --> 22:37.007
foreign entities,
even in your spare time.

22:37.051 --> 22:38.922
You do understand that, yes?

22:38.966 --> 22:40.620
Ma'am, no disrespect,

22:40.663 --> 22:42.056
but what free time
would that be?

22:42.099 --> 22:43.362
This is the first time
that I've been back home

22:43.405 --> 22:45.407
in over a year.

22:45.451 --> 22:48.410
Am I--
permission to speak freely?

22:48.454 --> 22:51.718
Go ahead.

22:51.761 --> 22:54.721
Am I in any sort
of trouble here, sir?

22:54.764 --> 22:56.244
I don't understand
what's going on.

22:56.287 --> 22:58.986
Did I do something wrong
or improper?

22:59.029 --> 23:02.511
Because if I did,
I swear it wasn't on purpose.

23:02.555 --> 23:03.599
Look, I can correct
that behavior.

23:03.643 --> 23:05.427
Just let me know what I did.

23:13.609 --> 23:15.611
Look,
and I never say this,

23:15.655 --> 23:18.353
but I think
he's telling the truth.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.182
Yeah.
I do too.

23:21.225 --> 23:23.445
But let's do this
by the numbers.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.055
Dig into his life, his family.

23:25.099 --> 23:26.970
See if there's any
money swirling around

23:27.014 --> 23:30.278
we should know about,
any secrets we don't see.

23:30.321 --> 23:31.975
On it.

23:34.282 --> 23:38.112
Please, someone help!

23:38.155 --> 23:39.722
Oh, God.

23:39.766 --> 23:43.334
- Help!
- Someone call 911!

23:43.378 --> 23:47.469
Help! The door's stuck!
Please help!

23:47.513 --> 23:48.949
Okay.
Hold on.

23:48.992 --> 23:50.385
We're gonna get you out.

23:52.822 --> 23:54.563
We need something
to break the windshield.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.260
Maybe we should wait
for help.

23:56.304 --> 23:59.481
We need to get them out now.
That transformer's coming down.

23:59.525 --> 24:00.874
And if it hits the car,

24:00.917 --> 24:02.310
it's gonna send a current
through the metal frame

24:02.353 --> 24:04.965
and they're all gonna die.

24:05.008 --> 24:06.009
Okay.

24:06.053 --> 24:08.795
Cover your face!
- Okay!

24:15.628 --> 24:18.457
- Give me your hand.
- You're okay.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.371
You're all right.

24:20.415 --> 24:23.374
Come on. Okay.

24:23.418 --> 24:25.986
Here you go, here you go.

24:27.248 --> 24:29.555
Naomi, move!

24:31.382 --> 24:32.775
You okay?

24:32.819 --> 24:35.169
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

24:35.212 --> 24:37.171
No, no!

24:38.607 --> 24:41.131
Wake up, wake up!

24:41.175 --> 24:42.872
Wake up, wake up.

24:42.916 --> 24:44.483
<i>Wake up, Mom.</i>

24:44.526 --> 24:48.051
Wake up, Mom.
I can't live without you.

24:53.579 --> 24:56.103
Help!
- Ben, what happened?

24:56.146 --> 24:57.365
She's not breathing.

24:57.408 --> 24:58.540
You need to do CPR.

24:58.584 --> 24:59.759
I don't know how.

24:59.802 --> 25:01.282
Then, you do
a precordial thump.

25:01.325 --> 25:02.718
Okay.
What the hell is that?

25:02.762 --> 25:03.806
Okay, it's
a quick fist strike

25:03.850 --> 25:04.807
to the center of the sternum

25:04.851 --> 25:06.461
designed
to get the heart started.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.028
Just trust me.
It'll work.

25:08.071 --> 25:10.552
I'll make it simple.
Just follow my arc.

25:13.250 --> 25:14.208
You can do this.

25:14.251 --> 25:16.558
Ben, now!

25:21.737 --> 25:23.826
Thank God.
Look at me, look at me.

25:23.870 --> 25:25.175
You're okay.

25:25.219 --> 25:26.612
Ben, the building's
collapsing in 45 minutes.

25:26.655 --> 25:29.136
If you don't get there,
he's gonna die.

25:29.179 --> 25:30.703
You need to find Jason.

25:30.746 --> 25:33.575
I'm gonna bring him back
to you.

25:33.619 --> 25:36.099
I promise.

25:59.906 --> 26:01.516
<i>Ben.</i>

26:04.388 --> 26:07.957
No, it doesn't matter!

26:08.001 --> 26:10.003
I don't care!

26:16.966 --> 26:19.403
Ben!

26:21.231 --> 26:23.233
- How much further?
- Quarter mile.

26:23.277 --> 26:25.061
You look like
you're about to pass out.

26:25.105 --> 26:26.541
- I can make it.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

26:26.585 --> 26:29.152
The body you leaped into
hasn't worked out in years.

26:29.196 --> 26:31.198
Walk for a minute.
Okay?

26:31.241 --> 26:34.636
You'll still make it in time.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.856
Ben, what's going on?

26:36.899 --> 26:38.553
Nothing!

26:41.904 --> 26:44.820
I'll walk a minute.

26:44.864 --> 26:47.127
No.
You don't get to do that.

26:47.170 --> 26:48.519
You don't get to hide things
from me anymore.

26:48.563 --> 26:49.869
You're upset
about me leaping.

26:49.912 --> 26:51.522
I am, but right now,

26:51.566 --> 26:53.350
I am upset because I thought
that you trusted me again.

26:53.394 --> 26:55.178
And clearly, you don't.
- Are you kidding?

26:55.222 --> 26:58.573
You're the only person I trust!

26:58.617 --> 27:00.575
What?

27:00.619 --> 27:02.925
Okay.

27:04.448 --> 27:08.539
I remember.

27:08.583 --> 27:11.064
Remember what, Ben?

27:14.154 --> 27:16.983
I remember how my mom died.

27:17.026 --> 27:20.073
I know why
I never told you about it.

27:20.116 --> 27:24.599
Ben,
you can tell me anything.

27:24.643 --> 27:27.733
The night my mom died,

27:27.776 --> 27:30.779
we got into a huge argument.

27:33.477 --> 27:37.220
I brought home my first
report card from high school.

27:37.264 --> 27:39.440
It was all--

27:39.483 --> 27:41.094
Bs.

27:41.137 --> 27:43.749
She was furious.

27:43.792 --> 27:46.882
You have an IQ of 197.

27:46.926 --> 27:49.015
I can see why.

27:49.058 --> 27:50.625
You did it on purpose.

27:50.669 --> 27:53.933
I was tired of her
telling me how special I was,

27:53.976 --> 27:58.328
that moving us to America was
so I could achieve something.

27:58.372 --> 28:01.027
I just wanted
to be a normal kid.

28:01.070 --> 28:02.419
And I didn't like living
in New York,

28:02.463 --> 28:04.726
so I told her I
hated her for it.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.597
And I took off.

28:06.641 --> 28:07.947
Come back.

28:12.908 --> 28:15.650
When I got home
later that night,

28:15.694 --> 28:18.740
I found her
on the kitchen floor.

28:18.784 --> 28:21.395
Mom.

28:21.438 --> 28:22.875
<i>Mom!</i>

28:22.918 --> 28:26.705
Wake up! Wake up!
Please!

28:26.748 --> 28:28.968
<i>She had a brain aneurysm.</i>

28:32.841 --> 28:36.149
Ben, I'm--

28:36.192 --> 28:38.194
I'm so sorry.

28:40.327 --> 28:44.679
My last moments with my mom
were full of anger.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.638
I never got to tell her
I was sorry

28:47.682 --> 28:52.948
or thank her for everything
she did for me.

28:52.992 --> 28:55.821
But that night changed my life.

28:55.864 --> 28:58.780
No wonder I got obsessed
with physics and time travel.

28:58.824 --> 29:01.783
No wonder I wanted
to join this program.

29:01.827 --> 29:04.786
You can draw a straight line
from that moment to this.

29:04.830 --> 29:08.572
I need to save Jason
and give him the opportunity

29:08.616 --> 29:10.792
to have a relationship
with his mom

29:10.836 --> 29:13.490
like I never could.

29:17.494 --> 29:20.280
The exit's just up there.

29:20.323 --> 29:23.457
Ben, you can do this.

29:23.500 --> 29:26.677
There's still time
to save Jason.

29:26.721 --> 29:27.766
The kid's a boy scout.

29:27.809 --> 29:29.289
I went through all
his financials,

29:29.332 --> 29:31.030
his family's financials.

29:31.073 --> 29:32.379
Nothing out of the ordinary.

29:32.422 --> 29:33.728
He's right, you know.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.208
He hasn't had a free moment
in a long time.

29:35.251 --> 29:36.557
He's been tied up
pretty heavy in the service

29:36.600 --> 29:37.950
since he was 18.

29:37.993 --> 29:39.865
It rules out him
working for the private sector

29:39.908 --> 29:41.736
or a foreign power.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.043
Are you sure this is the guy
from the photo?

29:44.086 --> 29:46.523
100%.
Unless he has a twin?

29:46.567 --> 29:47.742
- He does not.
- Okay.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.745
So Richard Martinez
is Leaper X.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.747
Well, I think more
appropriate phrasing

29:52.791 --> 29:55.532
would be Richard Martinez
will become Leaper X

29:55.576 --> 29:57.186
at some point in the future.

29:57.230 --> 29:58.884
We just don't know when or how.

29:58.927 --> 30:01.234
And unfortunately for us,

30:01.277 --> 30:03.236
neither does he,
at least not yet.

30:03.279 --> 30:07.240
So what do we do?

30:07.283 --> 30:09.242
- Black site him?
- Jen.

30:09.285 --> 30:10.852
I mean, this country's
done it for less.

30:10.896 --> 30:13.594
I'm gonna put him
under tight surveillance.

30:13.637 --> 30:15.988
But if what we're all
thinking is right,

30:16.031 --> 30:18.642
it's not gonna do much good.

30:18.686 --> 30:20.383
For now, at least.

30:20.427 --> 30:22.559
Okay, but what if going
and talking to him today

30:22.603 --> 30:23.952
just set the whole thing off?

30:23.996 --> 30:25.649
How do you mean?

30:25.693 --> 30:27.260
Well, like, so you and Magic,
you go and you talk to him

30:27.303 --> 30:28.522
and he doesn't really
understand why,

30:28.565 --> 30:30.176
so he starts
digging into Magic,

30:30.219 --> 30:33.135
and he finds out all of this
secret stuff, and, eventually--

30:33.179 --> 30:34.702
Boom.

30:34.745 --> 30:36.704
Ten years later, he's a part
of the program and he leaps.

30:36.747 --> 30:38.793
Like did--did we
just make this happen?

30:38.837 --> 30:40.839
Ian, I can't
tie my brain in pretzels

30:40.882 --> 30:42.928
about what's gonna happen
in the future.

30:42.971 --> 30:44.277
We need to focus on the present

30:44.320 --> 30:47.933
and get back to Ben and Addison
in the past.

30:49.325 --> 30:50.457
Our lives are so insane.

30:50.500 --> 30:53.286
Yeah, I heard it.

31:02.338 --> 31:04.210
Excuse me.

31:04.253 --> 31:06.516
Jason?
Jason.

31:06.560 --> 31:07.909
Ben, he's over here.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.302
Jason!

31:09.345 --> 31:11.260
- Dad!
- Jason.

31:11.304 --> 31:12.348
What are you doing here?

31:12.392 --> 31:13.654
Jason, thank God you're okay.

31:13.697 --> 31:14.698
I got here before
the earthquake hit.

31:14.742 --> 31:16.178
But Mr. Wheeler's
still in there.

31:16.222 --> 31:17.527
We have to help him.
- I'll get him.

31:17.571 --> 31:20.139
You stay here.
- No. I'm coming with you.

31:20.182 --> 31:21.749
Ben, if you go
in that building,

31:21.792 --> 31:23.664
Ziggy says there's only a 30%
chance of you making it out.

31:23.707 --> 31:25.709
Listen to me,
no matter what happens,

31:25.753 --> 31:27.929
I need you to promise me you
won't go inside that building.

31:27.973 --> 31:30.149
- Dad!
- Just promise me.

31:36.851 --> 31:38.809
Get out of the way!
It's coming down!

31:45.599 --> 31:47.209
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:47.253 --> 31:49.995
Whoa, whoa!

31:50.038 --> 31:51.735
Ben, over here.

31:53.955 --> 31:55.174
Mr. Wheeler?

31:55.217 --> 31:58.481
Are you sure he's in there?

31:58.525 --> 32:01.963
Right.
Hologram.

32:02.007 --> 32:03.225
He's inside.

32:03.269 --> 32:05.010
He's just sitting there
in shock.

32:08.100 --> 32:12.495
Mr. Wheeler!

32:12.539 --> 32:13.496
- John?
- Look at me.

32:13.540 --> 32:14.802
What are you doing here?

32:14.845 --> 32:16.108
There's no time to explain.
We need to go.

32:16.151 --> 32:17.413
- Ben, we gotta go.
- No, no, it's my home.

32:17.457 --> 32:18.806
I know,
but this place is coming down.

32:18.849 --> 32:20.547
No time to explain!
I know!

32:20.590 --> 32:22.375
I know, but come on!
Okay.

32:22.418 --> 32:25.117
Ben, look out!

32:25.160 --> 32:27.554
Ben!

32:27.597 --> 32:29.295
Ben. <i></i>

32:29.338 --> 32:31.645
Ben!

32:36.693 --> 32:38.260
Ben?
I need you to wake up now.

32:38.304 --> 32:41.133
John, I'll go for help.

32:41.176 --> 32:43.135
Ian, how much time
do we have?

32:43.178 --> 32:46.573
<i>The building's gonna
collapse in two minutes.</i>

32:46.616 --> 32:49.010
Ben, I can't lose you,
not like this,

32:49.054 --> 32:52.100
not when you're finally
starting to remember.

32:52.144 --> 32:54.537
You need to wake up.

32:54.581 --> 32:56.061
Ben, I know you can hear me.

32:56.104 --> 32:57.584
Wake up.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.020
Dad!

32:59.064 --> 33:00.848
No, no, no.
You're not supposed to be here!

33:00.891 --> 33:03.329
Dad!
Dad, wake up!

33:06.071 --> 33:10.423
Come on, kid.

33:10.466 --> 33:14.470
Dad!

33:14.514 --> 33:17.038
Wake up.

33:17.082 --> 33:18.474
Way to go, kid!

33:23.001 --> 33:24.524
I told you not to come in here.

33:24.567 --> 33:27.048
Mr. Wheeler said
you were trapped.

33:27.092 --> 33:28.528
I can't lift this beam
by myself.

33:28.571 --> 33:29.746
It's too heavy.

33:29.790 --> 33:30.921
Ben, this building's
coming down.

33:30.965 --> 33:31.879
Okay.
We're gonna push on three.

33:31.922 --> 33:33.011
Okay?
- Okay.

33:33.054 --> 33:35.361
- Ready?
- One, two, three. Push!

33:42.629 --> 33:44.370
Yes.

33:45.762 --> 33:47.460
Jason, go, go, go!

33:47.503 --> 33:49.201
Go, go!
Keep moving!

33:49.244 --> 33:50.724
Go, go!

33:50.767 --> 33:52.378
Don't stop, don't stop,
don't stop!

34:12.920 --> 34:14.574
It's good.
You did good.

34:14.617 --> 34:17.055
Yeah.
It's okay.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.404
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be sorry.

34:18.447 --> 34:20.580
- I'm sorry.
- You're safe now. You're safe.

34:20.623 --> 34:23.583
You're okay.
You're safe now.

34:27.674 --> 34:29.110
Everything's gonna be okay.

34:33.984 --> 34:35.856
Everything's gonna be okay
from now on.

34:35.899 --> 34:38.424
I'm sorry.
I just missed this place.

34:38.467 --> 34:39.947
I know. <i></i>

34:39.990 --> 34:42.645
But you're all right now.
- This doesn't make any sense.

34:42.689 --> 34:44.430
You--you saved him.

34:44.473 --> 34:46.432
You should've leaped.

34:46.475 --> 34:49.957
Dad, what's wrong?

34:50.000 --> 34:53.743
I thought saving you
would be enough,

34:53.787 --> 34:56.485
that you and your mom
would fix things.

34:56.529 --> 34:58.705
But you never did.

34:58.748 --> 35:00.141
Are you kidding?

35:00.185 --> 35:01.925
She doesn't care about me
or this family!

35:01.969 --> 35:03.579
That's not true.

35:03.623 --> 35:07.583
She's gonna divorce you, Dad.

35:07.627 --> 35:09.281
I know.

35:09.324 --> 35:10.804
And I get that
you're angry with her

35:10.847 --> 35:13.633
for moving you away
from here...

35:13.676 --> 35:15.678
but she did it for you.

35:15.722 --> 35:18.420
I know it's hard for you
to see right now,

35:18.464 --> 35:21.119
but one day you will.

35:21.162 --> 35:23.904
And trust me,
when that day comes,

35:23.947 --> 35:25.340
you don't want to look back
at this moment

35:25.384 --> 35:27.168
wishing you had
done things differently,

35:27.212 --> 35:31.172
because that regret
never goes away.

35:44.272 --> 35:45.578
Jason?

35:45.621 --> 35:46.709
Hi, Mom.

35:46.753 --> 35:50.409
Oh, I'm so glad
you're all right.

35:53.455 --> 35:58.591
Thank you, John,
for bringing him back to me.

35:58.634 --> 36:02.203
Well, he had a lot of help.

36:03.770 --> 36:09.210
I am so sorry how you
found out about your dad and I.

36:09.254 --> 36:13.040
I never wanted that.
- I know.

36:13.083 --> 36:15.912
Dad told me about how
you helped those people.

36:15.956 --> 36:17.697
Are you hurt?

36:21.004 --> 36:23.572
Nothing that can't be healed.

36:23.616 --> 36:26.749
I love you, Mom.

36:26.793 --> 36:29.665
I love you too, sweetheart.

36:34.801 --> 36:35.802
<i>Ben?</i>

36:48.336 --> 36:51.470
Ben, you did it.

36:51.513 --> 36:53.950
Ziggy says that Jason
and Naomi reconcile,

36:53.994 --> 36:56.605
and he goes on
to become a civil engineer.

36:56.649 --> 36:58.912
He helps change the way
buildings are designed

36:58.955 --> 37:00.392
<i>to withstand earthquakes.</i>

37:00.435 --> 37:01.610
<i>His innovations have
been credited</i>

37:01.654 --> 37:04.744
with saving thousands of lives.

37:13.970 --> 37:16.059
Ben, what are you doing?

37:16.103 --> 37:18.105
The phones are working.
It's 1989.

37:18.148 --> 37:20.194
My mother is still alive.
I can call her.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.850
Ben, it is against the rules.
I can't let you do that.

37:23.893 --> 37:25.808
One...

37:25.852 --> 37:29.116
Ben.

37:29.159 --> 37:30.596
Damn it.
I can't remember the number.

37:30.639 --> 37:32.380
You realize, you're about
to leap at any moment?

37:32.424 --> 37:35.601
Addison, please.
I have to call her.

37:41.824 --> 37:45.567
212-177-2350.

37:45.611 --> 37:47.656
Thank you.

37:56.491 --> 37:58.885
<i>Hello?</i>

37:58.928 --> 38:01.888
Mom.

38:11.593 --> 38:15.293
- You got a second?
- Of course. What's up?

38:15.336 --> 38:17.338
Um, so you know how
I figured out that

38:17.382 --> 38:19.775
Ben was using
gravitational navigation,

38:19.819 --> 38:21.821
zig zagging his way
through time,

38:21.864 --> 38:23.823
sort of building up speed
from leap to leap

38:23.866 --> 38:25.303
in order to
get deep into the past?

38:25.346 --> 38:26.956
Yes.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.959
Well, after everything that
happened today with Leaper X--

38:31.396 --> 38:35.574
With Martinez, um,
it got me thinking that

38:35.617 --> 38:37.967
maybe I was looking
at the math wrong.

38:38.011 --> 38:39.491
Okay.

38:39.534 --> 38:41.754
I don't think that Ben
was trying to get to the past.

38:41.797 --> 38:45.018
I think that Ben was trying
to leap into the future.

38:45.061 --> 38:47.020
That shouldn't be possible.

38:47.063 --> 38:48.848
None of this
should be possible, Magic.

38:48.891 --> 38:51.677
I mean, everyone thinks
that something is impossible

38:51.720 --> 38:54.549
until somebody comes around
and figures out that it isn't.

38:54.593 --> 38:58.684
And maybe Ben figured it out.
He certainly is smart enough.

38:58.727 --> 39:01.513
Well, if he did,

39:01.556 --> 39:03.210
you're the only one
smart enough

39:03.253 --> 39:06.039
to figure out how and why.

39:06.082 --> 39:09.042
Get on it.
- Okay.

39:15.396 --> 39:16.919
I'm sorry.

39:16.963 --> 39:18.530
Yep.

39:18.573 --> 39:20.488
I know I shouldn't have
given Ben the number, but--

39:20.532 --> 39:24.623
You kidding?
I would've done the same thing.

39:24.666 --> 39:26.276
How are you holding up?

39:26.320 --> 39:31.412
I'm okay. Ben is--
he's different in there.

39:31.456 --> 39:32.544
Different how?

39:32.587 --> 39:37.026
Okay, Ben,
old Ben, he was amazing.

39:37.070 --> 39:38.463
Of course he was.
I was gonna marry him.

39:38.506 --> 39:43.859
But the Ben
that's in there, he--

39:43.903 --> 39:47.559
he's more vulnerable,

39:47.602 --> 39:51.780
more open,
more free with his feelings,

39:51.824 --> 39:53.739
in a way that
I'd always hoped we'd get to.

39:53.782 --> 39:59.527
But it feels like I'm falling
even more in love with him.

39:59.571 --> 40:04.010
Despite all of this.

40:04.053 --> 40:06.055
Is that insane?

40:06.099 --> 40:08.754
No.

40:08.797 --> 40:11.757
It's beautiful.

40:14.237 --> 40:15.587
Hey, do you wanna
get dinner,

40:15.630 --> 40:17.458
maybe catch up
on some "Housewives"?

40:17.502 --> 40:22.463
Yes and I guess so, for you.

40:22.507 --> 40:25.814
Those women have their hooks
in you, don't they?

40:25.858 --> 40:27.294
Maybe.

40:27.337 --> 40:29.514
But before anything,
I got to call my mom.

40:29.557 --> 40:31.472
That last leap
did a number on me.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.169
Yes.

40:51.971 --> 40:55.975
Father Davenport, thank God.
I'm afraid it's gotten worse.

40:56.018 --> 40:58.499
Please, come in.
