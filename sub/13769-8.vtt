REESE: Come on, let's go!

01:13.532 --> 01:15.116
What are we

01:13.532 --> 01:15.116
waiting for?!

01:15.158 --> 01:17.953
Dad's taking us to Francis'

01:15.158 --> 01:17.953
dude ranch for the weekend.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.204
Just the guys.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.206
I'm really going to miss

01:19.246 --> 01:21.206
my girlfriend Nicki.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.208
But then again,

01:21.248 --> 01:23.208
it's two days without Mom.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.960
I've been in the car since 6:00.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.127
(honking horn)

01:25.002 --> 01:26.127
Come on, Dad!

01:26.169 --> 01:27.128
You'll see her Sunday!

01:30.089 --> 01:32.593
I, uh... had to get my coffee.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.636
Okay, gentlemen...

01:34.678 --> 01:36.137
ready to roll?

01:34.678 --> 01:36.137
Yeah, let's do it.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.139
Let's roll already!

01:36.179 --> 01:38.139
Yeah, come on, Dad.

01:38.181 --> 01:40.059
(starts engine)

01:40.099 --> 01:42.061
Seat belt-- check.

01:42.101 --> 01:44.312
Map-- check.

01:44.354 --> 01:47.441
Sunglasses-- check.

01:47.482 --> 01:51.152
Lumbar pillow...

01:51.194 --> 01:52.320
check.

01:52.362 --> 01:56.450
Mirrors-- check.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.996
Does that sound like

01:58.201 --> 02:00.996
a loose valve casing to you?

02:01.038 --> 02:03.082
BOYS: Dad!

02:01.038 --> 02:03.082
All right.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.165
You boys will soon learn

02:04.207 --> 02:06.376
there's nothing wrong

02:04.207 --> 02:06.376
with being careful.

02:09.046 --> 02:11.214
Wow!

02:11.256 --> 02:13.008
Welcome to the Grotto.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.176
I'll be with you in one minute.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.887
No rush.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.887
We're just looking for Francis.

02:16.929 --> 02:18.179
Francis?

02:18.221 --> 02:19.890
You are Francis' family?

02:19.932 --> 02:21.224
Yes, we were just...

02:21.266 --> 02:23.936
(clanging)

02:29.608 --> 02:32.486
Welcome, family of Francis.

02:32.527 --> 02:35.114
I am Otto, and this is Gretchen.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.825
We have dreamed for

02:35.155 --> 02:37.825
months of meeting you

02:37.866 --> 02:39.493
and now finally

02:37.866 --> 02:39.493
you are here.

02:39.534 --> 02:42.788
And look at beautiful

02:39.534 --> 02:42.788
liebling!

02:42.830 --> 02:44.832
Your son is a genius.

02:44.873 --> 02:46.917
He has completely turned

02:44.873 --> 02:46.917
this place around.

02:46.959 --> 02:48.043
Well, not physically,

02:46.959 --> 02:48.043
of course.

02:48.085 --> 02:51.046
We still face the

02:48.085 --> 02:51.046
arroyo as before,

02:51.088 --> 02:53.214
but we could never

02:51.088 --> 02:53.214
have survived

02:53.256 --> 02:54.842
without his hard work,

02:53.256 --> 02:54.842
Mm-mm.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.217
his intelligence

02:54.883 --> 02:56.217
Mm-hmm.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.302
his leadership...

02:57.344 --> 02:58.637
Really?

02:58.679 --> 03:00.472
Now, you just have

02:58.679 --> 03:00.472
the one Francis?

03:00.514 --> 03:03.224
As long as you are here,

03:00.514 --> 03:03.224
everything is on the house.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.893
(chuckling)

03:04.935 --> 03:06.854
Now, would you like

03:04.935 --> 03:06.854
to review the staff?

03:06.895 --> 03:07.896
Oh, I...

03:07.938 --> 03:10.524
Please? It would mean

03:07.938 --> 03:10.524
so much to them.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.526
(chuckling)

03:16.697 --> 03:18.197
Good.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.197
Mmm.

03:21.493 --> 03:23.495
Well...

03:25.747 --> 03:28.042
Aren't they

03:25.747 --> 03:28.042
wonderful?

03:28.083 --> 03:30.961
They are Hopi Indian

03:28.083 --> 03:30.961
kachina dolls.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.504
Now, according

03:31.003 --> 03:32.504
to legend,

03:32.546 --> 03:35.256
he tracks down

03:32.546 --> 03:35.256
misbehaving children

03:35.298 --> 03:37.258
und  chews up

03:35.298 --> 03:37.258
their bones

03:37.300 --> 03:41.889
so no one will ever

03:37.300 --> 03:41.889
find them again.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.516
Mythology is so much

03:41.930 --> 03:44.516
fun, don't you think?

03:44.558 --> 03:46.351
Oh, no, no. No.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.687
They are far

03:46.393 --> 03:48.687
too valuable.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.647
You mustn't

03:48.729 --> 03:50.647
touch them.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.191
Can I trust you?

03:52.232 --> 03:54.401
I don't see why not.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.865
Uh... very nice.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.742
I like your boots.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.742
Give him your boots.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.284
No, no! No, no, I couldn't.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.369
You all look wonderful.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.537
Thank you.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.955
Do you hear that?

04:06.997 --> 04:08.289
He likes us.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.833
Back to work.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.460
Hey, guys.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.295
I'm so sorry.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.797
I came as fast

04:14.337 --> 04:15.797
as I could.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.797
Hey.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.298
I-I'm not going

04:15.839 --> 04:17.298
to get too close.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.759
I'm fighting

04:17.340 --> 04:18.759
a terrible cold.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.385
I'll probably be

04:18.800 --> 04:20.385
in bed all weekend.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.303
Mom didn't come.

04:22.345 --> 04:25.224
Well, we'll just have

04:22.345 --> 04:25.224
to enjoy ourselves without her.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.225
Come on.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.308
So, where's Francis?

04:27.350 --> 04:28.602
Is he really

04:27.350 --> 04:28.602
the foreman?

04:28.643 --> 04:29.978
We haven't seen him

04:28.643 --> 04:29.978
in months.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.230
You'll have to forgive

04:30.020 --> 04:31.230
the boys.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.355
They've always

04:31.271 --> 04:32.355
looked up to Francis

04:32.397 --> 04:33.774
like he's some kind of hero.

04:35.234 --> 04:37.027
(horse whinnies in distance)

04:45.285 --> 04:46.578
(whinnies)

04:48.205 --> 04:49.998
How's it going, guys?

04:50.040 --> 04:51.250
My God, Francis!

04:51.291 --> 04:53.627
How the heck did you learn

04:51.291 --> 04:53.627
to ride a horse like that?

04:53.668 --> 04:55.129
Well, you got to pick it up

04:53.668 --> 04:55.129
quick around here.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.131
We break horses, brand cattle...

04:57.172 --> 04:59.925
It's about as close

04:57.172 --> 04:59.925
to the Old West as

04:57.172 --> 04:59.925
you'll ever find.

04:59.967 --> 05:03.762
(horn toots)

04:59.967 --> 05:03.762
Where do I find

04:59.967 --> 05:03.762
the jazzercise class?

05:03.804 --> 05:05.806
Other side of

05:03.804 --> 05:05.806
the smoothie bar.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.349
(light laughter)

05:08.391 --> 05:10.060
Oh, that chicken

05:08.391 --> 05:10.060
was fantastic.

05:10.102 --> 05:11.979
And where'd you learn

05:10.102 --> 05:11.979
to cook chili like that?

05:12.020 --> 05:13.814
I spend time

05:12.020 --> 05:13.814
in the kitchen, too.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.984
The secret to good chili

05:13.855 --> 05:16.984
is how long you soak the beans.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.652
So, to recap

05:17.025 --> 05:18.652
our little contest--

05:18.693 --> 05:20.654
Dewey wins for most tuneful.

05:20.695 --> 05:24.074
Francis for the loudest.

05:24.116 --> 05:26.160
I was the sneakiest.

05:26.201 --> 05:29.037
Malcolm, the most obnoxious.

05:26.201 --> 05:29.037
Ech.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.580
At least

05:29.079 --> 05:30.580
I wasn't disqualified.

05:30.622 --> 05:31.999
I gambled and lost.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.292
It happens.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.375
This is fun.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.752
Why don't we do this

05:34.417 --> 05:35.752
every weekend?

05:35.794 --> 05:37.254
Boy, wouldn't that be nice?

05:37.296 --> 05:38.379
Oh, I almost forgot.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.174
Francis, I booked a

05:38.421 --> 05:40.174
trip for all of us

05:40.215 --> 05:42.383
to watch the sunrise

05:40.215 --> 05:42.383
tomorrow morning

05:40.215 --> 05:42.383
at Devil's Rock.

05:42.425 --> 05:43.885
I don't want

05:42.425 --> 05:43.885
to get up at sunrise

05:43.927 --> 05:45.386
to go look

05:43.927 --> 05:45.386
at some stupid rock.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.388
It may be a stupid rock

05:45.428 --> 05:47.388
for most of the year,

05:47.430 --> 05:48.473
but for the rest of this week

05:48.515 --> 05:50.391
the angle of the sun at dawn

05:48.515 --> 05:50.391
makes it look

05:50.433 --> 05:52.560
like there's fire coming out

05:50.433 --> 05:52.560
of the devil's eyes.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.562
Actually,

05:52.602 --> 05:54.562
I can't do it tomorrow, Dad.

05:54.604 --> 05:55.897
What do you mean you can't?

05:55.939 --> 05:57.398
You were the one who called me

05:55.939 --> 05:57.398
and told me about it.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.400
I know, but I have to lead

05:57.440 --> 05:59.400
a ride at 7:00

05:59.442 --> 06:01.569
and it takes me two hours

05:59.442 --> 06:01.569
to get the horses ready.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.322
Can we go

06:01.611 --> 06:03.322
on that ride?

06:01.611 --> 06:03.322
Yeah, can we?

06:03.362 --> 06:05.115
Sure.

06:03.362 --> 06:05.115
Yeah!

06:03.362 --> 06:05.115
All right.

06:05.157 --> 06:06.407
Hey, what

06:05.157 --> 06:06.407
are you doing?

06:06.449 --> 06:08.118
I brought some stuff

06:06.449 --> 06:08.118
I wanted to burn.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.577
You're on cowboy time now.

06:09.619 --> 06:10.996
You got to get to bed early

06:09.619 --> 06:10.996
and rest up

06:11.038 --> 06:12.413
if you want to come riding

06:11.038 --> 06:12.413
in the morning.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.582
Bed? But I'm not tired.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.582
Sorry about

06:12.455 --> 06:14.582
the Devil's Rock thing.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.251
Hey, don't worry about it.

06:16.293 --> 06:17.418
I'll go by myself.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.628
It'll be great.

06:19.754 --> 06:22.423
Here it comes.

06:22.465 --> 06:23.508
Wow.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.926
That's amazing, Dad.

06:24.968 --> 06:27.971
I'm so happy we could

06:24.968 --> 06:27.971
do this together, son.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.937
All right, we got

06:34.144 --> 06:35.937
some loose gravel coming up

06:35.979 --> 06:37.438
so let's keep

06:35.979 --> 06:37.438
your horses in line.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.151
How do you know if the one

06:38.940 --> 06:41.151
you're on is still alive?

06:41.193 --> 06:43.695
No one rides fast until

06:41.193 --> 06:43.695
you're familiar with the horses.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.446
So, let's keep both

06:43.737 --> 06:45.446
hands on the reins

06:45.488 --> 06:47.157
and keep those helmets on tight.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.368
What's with Francis?

06:49.408 --> 06:51.078
I don't know.

06:49.408 --> 06:51.078
We've been riding for an hour,

06:51.119 --> 06:52.411
I can still see the barn.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.456
Whoa, those look cool.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.543
When can we ride those?

06:58.585 --> 07:00.295
You're not going

06:58.585 --> 07:00.295
anywhere near those.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.380
What? Why not?

07:01.420 --> 07:02.339
Because I know you guys

07:02.381 --> 07:03.840
and I don't want

07:02.381 --> 07:03.840
to take a day off work

07:03.882 --> 07:06.134
just to peel your carcasses

07:03.882 --> 07:06.134
out of a barbwire fence.

07:06.176 --> 07:07.844
Why don't you guys

07:06.176 --> 07:07.844
just and relax

07:07.886 --> 07:09.179
and enjoy the scenery?

07:09.221 --> 07:11.472
You seem to be the only

07:09.221 --> 07:11.472
riders having a problem.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.892
MAN:

07:11.514 --> 07:13.892
Is Joey

07:11.514 --> 07:13.892
the big cowboy?

07:13.934 --> 07:15.060
Yes, he is.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.437
Yes, he is.

07:23.402 --> 07:25.862
Why won't you guys play

07:23.402 --> 07:25.862
Ping-Pong with me?

07:25.904 --> 07:27.655
The table's free and I've

07:25.904 --> 07:27.655
got the equipment form

07:27.697 --> 07:29.283
for Dad to sign.

07:29.324 --> 07:30.784
Because you're stupid.

07:29.324 --> 07:30.784
And we didn't come

07:30.825 --> 07:31.952
all the way

07:30.825 --> 07:31.952
out here

07:31.993 --> 07:33.370
to be stuck playing with you.

07:33.412 --> 07:34.495
Wait just a minute.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.706
That is precisely

07:34.537 --> 07:36.706
why we came out here--

07:36.748 --> 07:39.500
so that we can all have

07:36.748 --> 07:39.500
a good time together.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.962
Now, your brother asked

07:39.542 --> 07:41.962
you to play with him

07:42.003 --> 07:44.631
and that is exactly what

07:42.003 --> 07:44.631
you are going to do.

07:48.427 --> 07:50.511
Our dad signed the permission

07:48.427 --> 07:50.511
slip for the ATVs.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.721
Mmm.

07:51.763 --> 07:54.515
You don't look 16 to me.

07:54.557 --> 07:55.976
It's a glandular thing.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.603
He's very sensitive

07:56.017 --> 07:58.603
about how short he is.

07:58.645 --> 08:01.940
Ooh. Perhaps

07:58.645 --> 08:01.940
you are a late bloomer.

08:01.982 --> 08:05.235
I had my baby teeth

08:01.982 --> 08:05.235
until I was 14.

08:05.277 --> 08:07.487
I'll get the keys.

08:11.783 --> 08:12.993
"All terrain."

08:13.034 --> 08:15.536
I wonder if that actually means

08:13.034 --> 08:15.536
all  terrain.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.538
They couldn't say it

08:15.578 --> 08:17.538
if it wasn't true.

08:21.376 --> 08:22.543
Whee-hee!

08:22.585 --> 08:24.921
Okay, so trees

08:22.585 --> 08:24.921
aren't terrain.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.547
Now we know.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.049
Ow!

08:33.596 --> 08:34.722
I specifically told you guys

08:34.764 --> 08:36.557
stay away

08:34.764 --> 08:36.557
from those ATVs!

08:36.599 --> 08:38.643
What the hell

08:36.599 --> 08:38.643
were you thinking?!

08:38.685 --> 08:40.854
They don't think, Francis.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.854
They never have!

08:40.895 --> 08:42.772
The only thing their

08:40.895 --> 08:42.772
heads are good for

08:42.814 --> 08:44.191
is to plug up

08:42.814 --> 08:44.191
their necks.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.442
I blame the oldest one.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.652
The others follow him

08:45.484 --> 08:47.652
like sheep.

08:47.694 --> 08:48.987
I thought I could

08:47.694 --> 08:48.987
trust you guys

08:49.029 --> 08:50.238
on your own for

08:49.029 --> 08:50.238
a few minutes.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.448
Well, obviously

08:50.280 --> 08:51.448
I was wrong.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.283
You are still the same

08:51.490 --> 08:53.283
stupid, reckless idiots

08:53.325 --> 08:55.494
you've always been.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.037
Francis, you don't have

08:55.535 --> 08:57.037
to yell at them like that.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.788
I'll yell at

08:57.078 --> 08:58.788
whoever I want!

08:58.830 --> 09:00.581
And even though I wish

08:58.830 --> 09:00.581
I hadn't said that,

09:00.623 --> 09:02.042
it's too late now!

09:02.083 --> 09:05.170
From now on, you boys

09:02.083 --> 09:05.170
stay away from the horses,

09:05.212 --> 09:07.881
the vehicles, the pool

09:05.212 --> 09:07.881
and the other guests.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.007
That means you

09:07.922 --> 09:09.007
are confined

09:09.049 --> 09:10.967
to your room until

09:09.049 --> 09:10.967
further notice.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.220
You're sending us to our room?!

09:11.009 --> 09:13.220
That's right.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.388
I don't believe it.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.596
You've turned into Mom.

09:15.638 --> 09:18.016
Yeah? Well,

09:15.638 --> 09:18.016
sometimes Mom's right.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.434
You take that back!

09:19.476 --> 09:21.895
Oh, my God.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.317
You broke my doll?

09:27.359 --> 09:29.777
How could you be

09:27.359 --> 09:29.777
so thoughtless?

09:29.819 --> 09:31.279
You promised me

09:31.321 --> 09:33.323
you would leave

09:31.321 --> 09:33.323
it alone,

09:33.365 --> 09:36.826
but it was

09:33.365 --> 09:36.826
just... a lie.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.329
Oh...

09:39.371 --> 09:41.498
All right, boys,

09:39.371 --> 09:41.498
go to your room now!

09:43.750 --> 09:45.419
There, there.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.003
We will give him new legs

09:47.045 --> 09:49.130
and then

09:47.045 --> 09:49.130
he will be all good again

09:49.172 --> 09:50.882
just like cousin Heinrich.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.133
(chuckling)

09:52.175 --> 09:53.718
Well, you did the

09:52.175 --> 09:53.718
right thing, Francis.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.803
I just don't know when

09:53.760 --> 09:55.803
they're going to learn.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.638
Them? What about you?

09:57.680 --> 09:58.890
How could you sign

09:57.680 --> 09:58.890
a release form

09:58.932 --> 10:01.101
and not read

09:58.932 --> 10:01.101
what it's intended for?

10:01.142 --> 10:02.519
For God's sake, Dad,

10:02.561 --> 10:04.104
my job is hard enough as it is.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.357
"Sometimes Mom's right?

10:07.399 --> 10:09.568
Sometimes Mom's right?"

10:09.609 --> 10:11.652
Why didn't he just

10:09.609 --> 10:11.652
throw acid in our faces?

10:11.694 --> 10:13.738
You know, I'd

10:11.694 --> 10:13.738
actually prefer that.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.073
I can't believe

10:13.780 --> 10:15.073
he yelled at us

10:15.115 --> 10:16.157
right in front

10:15.115 --> 10:16.157
of that French guy.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.034
He can't get away with this.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.036
We're going to get him back.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.538
You're damn right we are.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.705
Are you with us, Dewey?

10:24.416 --> 10:25.875
Dewey?

10:25.917 --> 10:27.752
And I know

10:25.917 --> 10:27.752
I shouldn't have taken it

10:27.794 --> 10:29.129
but it looked so cool.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.922
And then in the tree

10:30.964 --> 10:35.469
I forgot it was in my pocket,

10:30.964 --> 10:35.469
and I fell... and it broke.

10:35.510 --> 10:38.388
Oh, I know, I

10:35.510 --> 10:38.388
know, sweetheart.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.680
And you know what?

10:39.722 --> 10:41.391
I should never

10:39.722 --> 10:41.391
have yelled at you.

10:41.433 --> 10:42.850
I feel terrible about that.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.060
You do?

10:44.102 --> 10:45.895
Oh, of course I do.

10:45.937 --> 10:49.774
So, we both feel bad

10:45.937 --> 10:49.774
about what we did, huh?

10:49.816 --> 10:52.693
You know what your

10:49.816 --> 10:52.693
Tante Gretchen does

10:49.816 --> 10:52.693
when she feels bad?

10:52.735 --> 10:54.695
She works.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.864
She works herself

10:54.737 --> 10:56.864
to the point

10:56.906 --> 10:58.992
where her body

10:56.906 --> 10:58.992
screams in pain

10:59.033 --> 11:00.910
and her soul

10:59.033 --> 11:00.910
begs for mercy.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.078
Why?

11:02.120 --> 11:04.705
It's the best form of penance.

11:04.747 --> 11:08.709
Oh, when my fingers are raw,

11:04.747 --> 11:08.709
and my back is racked

11:08.751 --> 11:11.171
with crippling pain,

11:08.751 --> 11:11.171
I feel all better.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.713
Well, that might work for you...

11:12.755 --> 11:14.215
Let's do it.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.215
Oh!

11:14.257 --> 11:15.634
This will be  wunderbar.

11:15.674 --> 11:17.218
The two old men

11:15.674 --> 11:17.218
go for a ride.

11:17.260 --> 11:20.221
See the beauty of the desert,

11:17.260 --> 11:20.221
commune with nature...

11:20.263 --> 11:22.307
I just hate to take up

11:20.263 --> 11:22.307
too much of your time.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.101
I already told the horses

11:22.349 --> 11:25.101
that we're going.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.603
Don't make me look bad.

11:27.646 --> 11:28.729
(whinnies)

11:28.771 --> 11:29.981
Whoo!

11:30.023 --> 11:31.316
Wh-what's the matter

11:30.023 --> 11:31.316
with this horse?

11:31.358 --> 11:33.652
Nothing.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.652
Buttercup is very sweet.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.029
(whinnies)

11:36.070 --> 11:37.364
Are you sure

11:37.405 --> 11:40.116
you're not still angry

11:37.405 --> 11:40.116
with the boys?

11:40.158 --> 11:44.120
Buttercup is very good at

11:40.158 --> 11:44.120
picking up unresolved feelings.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.623
No. I told you,

11:44.162 --> 11:46.623
I'm over it. I'm fine.

11:46.665 --> 11:47.957
Buttercup is never wrong.

11:47.999 --> 11:51.752
Once Gretchen made me

11:47.999 --> 11:51.752
an omelet with mushrooms.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.754
Oh, I hate mushrooms.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.591
But I didn't say anything.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.591
I had two helpings.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.760
Well, Buttercup forced me

11:56.633 --> 11:59.760
to go back

11:59.802 --> 12:01.638
and confront her.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.765
We had the best sex

12:01.680 --> 12:04.765
we had had in years.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.767
Thank you, Buttercup.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.769
Maybe I should

12:06.809 --> 12:08.769
ride your horse.

12:08.811 --> 12:09.937
Good idea.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.648
Scout doesn't pick up

12:09.979 --> 12:11.648
on anything...

12:11.690 --> 12:13.441
unless you're secretly gay.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.780
Thanks, very much.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.700
Hey, fellas,

12:19.822 --> 12:21.700
what can I do for you?

12:21.740 --> 12:24.285
Um, we're looking

12:21.740 --> 12:24.285
for some sparklers.

12:24.327 --> 12:26.162
And do you have any of those

12:24.327 --> 12:26.162
things called pinwheels?

12:26.204 --> 12:27.497
Sure do.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.374
Also got some

12:27.539 --> 12:29.374
lady fingers.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.792
(engine starting)

12:29.416 --> 12:31.792
Okay, let's start

12:29.416 --> 12:31.792
with 18 genies,

12:31.834 --> 12:33.794
two dozen gel-ignited

12:31.834 --> 12:33.794
pomegranates

12:33.836 --> 12:35.171
and a case

12:33.836 --> 12:35.171
of devil dragons.

12:35.213 --> 12:37.507
We're out of the 99s,

12:35.213 --> 12:37.507
you want 44s at half price?

12:37.549 --> 12:38.799
44s are worthless.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.595
Make it six packs of red dogs

12:38.841 --> 12:41.595
with time-delay fuses.

12:41.636 --> 12:42.803
Powder or aluminum phosphate?

12:42.845 --> 12:44.013
Who do you think

12:42.845 --> 12:44.013
you're dealing with?

12:44.055 --> 12:45.223
MALCOLM:

12:44.055 --> 12:45.223
One last thing.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.808
We're planning an event

12:45.265 --> 12:47.808
for a friend.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.810
You got anything that

12:47.850 --> 12:49.810
will make it really special?

12:49.852 --> 12:52.313
Depends on how much

12:49.852 --> 12:52.313
you're willing to spend.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.773
Why don't you let

12:52.355 --> 12:54.773
my dad worry about that?

12:55.858 --> 13:00.238
Boys... I'd like

12:55.858 --> 13:00.238
to introduce you...

13:01.573 --> 13:04.783
...to the Komodo 3000.

13:06.536 --> 13:09.247
Oh, yeah.

13:06.536 --> 13:09.247
This will get him back.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.417
How are we doing?

13:12.459 --> 13:13.834
My fingers hurt

13:13.876 --> 13:16.837
but that bad feeling

13:13.876 --> 13:16.837
in my stomach is getting better.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.339
This is good.

13:18.381 --> 13:20.759
It means you are getting

13:18.381 --> 13:20.759
in touch with your guilt,  ja?

13:22.343 --> 13:23.428
What's the matter?

13:23.470 --> 13:25.555
I just remembered

13:23.470 --> 13:25.555
when I was nine,

13:25.597 --> 13:29.058
my uncle gave me a pfennig

13:25.597 --> 13:29.058
to put in the wishing well

13:29.100 --> 13:33.521
but I threw a pebble in the well

13:29.100 --> 13:33.521
und  I kept the pfennig.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.898
I am pure evil.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.567
(groans)

13:37.609 --> 13:40.570
I once put a garden slug

13:37.609 --> 13:40.570
in Reese's sandwich...

13:40.612 --> 13:41.946
and he ate it.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.323
Und  you feel bad about this?

13:44.407 --> 13:45.866
Then scrub.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.954
Oh, look. Blood.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.581
We are halfway there.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.124
(laughing)

13:53.166 --> 13:54.875
I can see why you

13:53.166 --> 13:54.875
love it out here, Otto.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.877
Yeah, yeah, this is where

13:54.917 --> 13:56.877
I come to think,

13:56.919 --> 14:00.881
to unwind, or when I am in

13:56.919 --> 14:00.881
the doghouse with Gretchen.

14:00.923 --> 14:04.803
Ooh, I can be

14:00.923 --> 14:04.803
a naughty boy.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.971
I have a barstool in the garage

14:04.843 --> 14:06.971
for the same thing.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.264
Oh.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.890
Well...

14:09.932 --> 14:11.810
I suppose we should be

14:09.932 --> 14:11.810
heading back.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.978
Yeah, yeah, we

14:11.850 --> 14:13.978
could do that or...

14:14.020 --> 14:17.064
we could get to know each

14:14.020 --> 14:17.064
other a little better.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.358
Is that schnapps?

14:18.399 --> 14:21.611
In my experience, many

14:18.399 --> 14:21.611
interesting things

14:21.653 --> 14:25.239
can be discovered with

14:21.653 --> 14:25.239
just the proper dosage.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.075
(laughing)

14:28.117 --> 14:29.410
Watch this.

14:29.452 --> 14:30.453
(gunfire)

14:31.663 --> 14:32.747
Oh, good shooting.

14:32.789 --> 14:34.123
You shot that rock

14:32.789 --> 14:34.123
clean into two.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.082
Yeah!

14:35.124 --> 14:36.835
To Hal.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.835
To Otto.

14:36.876 --> 14:37.418
Salud.

14:37.460 --> 14:38.919
Salud!

14:38.961 --> 14:42.298
Oh, have you ever seen

14:38.961 --> 14:42.298
so many stars in the sky.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.717
Oh, look. Up there.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.385
There's Orion.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.385
Where?

14:45.426 --> 14:46.720
Right there.

14:46.761 --> 14:47.846
Those three stars

14:46.761 --> 14:47.846
are his belt.

14:47.887 --> 14:48.929
(gunfire and neighing)

14:48.971 --> 14:50.515
What? There?

14:50.557 --> 14:51.641
(gunfire)

14:51.683 --> 14:53.309
No. There.

14:53.351 --> 14:54.935
(neighing)

14:54.977 --> 14:56.937
And there is his spear.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.023
(neighing)

14:59.065 --> 15:00.941
Oh, great.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.570
Something scared off

15:00.983 --> 15:03.570
the horses.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.570
Oh...

15:03.611 --> 15:05.822
(bullets hitting)

15:03.611 --> 15:05.822
Ooh.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.822
Whoa.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.031
(shouting)

15:07.073 --> 15:08.157
Run!

15:09.909 --> 15:12.953
(screaming)

15:12.995 --> 15:15.039
Ooh! Something bit me.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.750
(groaning)

15:16.791 --> 15:19.960
Oh, God, Otto,

15:16.791 --> 15:19.960
you're wounded.

15:20.002 --> 15:23.005
Finally... I hit something.

15:28.845 --> 15:29.970
Well, I just listened

15:30.012 --> 15:31.681
at the boys' door

15:30.012 --> 15:31.681
and not a peep.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.349
I hated coming

15:31.723 --> 15:33.349
down on them like that

15:33.391 --> 15:35.142
but that's the only way

15:33.391 --> 15:35.142
they'll listen.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.018
Absolutely.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.187
I mean, I think

15:36.060 --> 15:38.187
I was hard but fair.

15:38.229 --> 15:40.064
You couldn't have

15:38.229 --> 15:40.064
been more fair.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.982
Okay, and now you're smiling

15:40.106 --> 15:41.982
which means

15:42.024 --> 15:44.611
in about two seconds I'm

15:42.024 --> 15:44.611
going to look like a jackass.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.028
You can keep going

15:44.652 --> 15:46.028
if you want.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.988
Just tell me.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.988
The boys haven't been

15:48.030 --> 15:50.074
in the room for three hours.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.074
What?

15:50.116 --> 15:52.702
They want you to meet them

15:50.116 --> 15:52.702
at the south gate.

15:52.744 --> 15:53.994
This should explain everything.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.997
I'm afraid it starts off

15:54.036 --> 15:56.997
a little antagonistic.

15:57.039 --> 16:00.000
Is that last word

15:57.039 --> 16:00.000
"lick" or "wipe"?

16:00.042 --> 16:02.253
I think you're safe

16:00.042 --> 16:02.253
either way.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.880
(grunting)

16:03.922 --> 16:06.299
How far do you think we've gone?

16:06.340 --> 16:09.886
Well, judging by that

16:06.340 --> 16:09.886
rock formation over there,

16:09.928 --> 16:12.806
about 12 feet.

16:12.847 --> 16:16.058
Oh, if only Francis

16:12.847 --> 16:16.058
knew we were out here

16:16.100 --> 16:17.602
he would save us.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.895
Oh, sure.

16:18.937 --> 16:20.187
Super Francis.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.523
He'd make a jetpack

16:20.229 --> 16:22.523
out of a cactus

16:22.565 --> 16:24.024
and fly us all home.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.611
Why are you so angry at Francis?

16:26.653 --> 16:28.112
I am not angry at Francis.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.739
Well, well you shouldn't be.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.950
He is smart,

16:29.781 --> 16:31.950
he is capable,

16:31.991 --> 16:33.033
he is hardworking

16:33.075 --> 16:37.831
and I personally never met

16:33.075 --> 16:37.831
anyone more "relibable."

16:37.872 --> 16:39.248
Yes, now.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.626
When I had him for 18 years,

16:41.668 --> 16:46.046
I punished him and threatened

16:41.668 --> 16:46.046
him and cried over him

16:46.088 --> 16:48.508
and begged him

16:46.088 --> 16:48.508
and screamed at him

16:48.549 --> 16:52.219
and his life was one

16:48.549 --> 16:52.219
train wreck after another.

16:52.261 --> 16:57.892
Two months with you and now

16:52.261 --> 16:57.892
he's a model citizen.

16:57.934 --> 17:01.479
And this is what

16:57.934 --> 17:01.479
you are so upset about?

17:01.521 --> 17:03.564
Yes, I think it's

17:01.521 --> 17:03.564
pretty obvious.

17:03.606 --> 17:08.235
All he needed was his father

17:03.606 --> 17:08.235
to get out of his face

17:08.277 --> 17:10.070
so that he could meet someone

17:10.112 --> 17:12.573
who knows how to turn

17:10.112 --> 17:12.573
his life around.

17:12.615 --> 17:17.871
Well, if I am such a genius,

17:12.615 --> 17:17.871
how come that I am drunk

17:17.912 --> 17:21.916
and lost in the desert

17:17.912 --> 17:21.916
with a bullet in my ass?

17:23.710 --> 17:26.587
Hal, listen to me.

17:26.629 --> 17:29.674
Francis had all

17:26.629 --> 17:29.674
of his great qualities

17:29.716 --> 17:32.301
on the day that I met him.

17:32.343 --> 17:33.553
What?

17:33.594 --> 17:34.804
What do you think?

17:34.846 --> 17:37.097
He just picked them up

17:34.846 --> 17:37.097
off the road?

17:37.139 --> 17:40.560
"Hello, I would like

17:37.139 --> 17:40.560
a Big Gulp and a candy bar

17:40.601 --> 17:42.102
and a new personality."

17:42.144 --> 17:44.480
No, Hal. Listen to me.

17:44.522 --> 17:45.982
Your acorn

17:46.024 --> 17:51.529
did not fall very far

17:46.024 --> 17:51.529
from your tree.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.741
So I'm not such a failure

17:51.571 --> 17:54.741
as a father?

17:54.782 --> 17:56.701
Absolutely not.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.412
Now, if your

17:56.743 --> 17:59.412
crisis is over,

17:59.453 --> 18:02.498
my buttocks could use

17:59.453 --> 18:02.498
a vigorous rubbing.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.834
They are starting to go numb.

18:04.876 --> 18:07.127
GRETCHEN:

18:04.876 --> 18:07.127
Oh, that's it, Dewey.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.421
We can't miss a spot.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.590
Right corner.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.590
(grunts)

18:10.631 --> 18:11.758
Got it.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.009
Ja.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.970
I think that is it.

18:16.012 --> 18:19.223
Finally,

18:16.012 --> 18:19.223
we are finished.

18:19.265 --> 18:22.727
Wow, I feel wonderful.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.771
Ja,  it's beautiful,

18:22.769 --> 18:24.771
isn't it?

18:24.812 --> 18:27.065
This is the moment

18:24.812 --> 18:27.065
you work for.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.400
Your soul is set free.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.569
Your burden

18:29.442 --> 18:31.569
has been lifted.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.072
I kind of feel

18:31.611 --> 18:34.072
like I'm floating.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.741
Well, that's probably

18:34.113 --> 18:36.741
the ammonia

18:36.783 --> 18:40.369
but we have done well.

18:40.411 --> 18:44.164
A clean room leads

18:40.411 --> 18:44.164
to a clean conscience,  ja?

18:44.206 --> 18:46.166
I think I'm happier

18:44.206 --> 18:46.166
than I've ever been.

18:46.208 --> 18:49.087
Mm, me, too,  liebe.

18:49.128 --> 18:53.173
Here, I want to give

18:49.128 --> 18:53.173
you something.

18:53.215 --> 18:57.053
Promise you will think

18:53.215 --> 18:57.053
of me when you use it.

18:57.095 --> 19:00.056
Thank you, Tante Gretchen.

19:00.098 --> 19:02.266
De nada.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.977
I don't know

19:02.308 --> 19:03.977
what you guys are trying

19:04.018 --> 19:05.478
to pull here

19:04.018 --> 19:05.478
but you should know

19:05.519 --> 19:07.146
I am way ahead

19:05.519 --> 19:07.146
of you.

19:10.232 --> 19:11.275
What's that?

19:11.317 --> 19:13.569
Looks like a fuse.

19:13.611 --> 19:15.613
All right, what exactly

19:13.611 --> 19:15.613
are you planning?

19:15.655 --> 19:17.239
We're planning

19:15.655 --> 19:17.239
to get you back.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.575
We want our brother back

19:19.617 --> 19:21.119
the way he used to be.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.204
We know how much

19:22.244 --> 19:24.204
you always liked fire...

19:24.246 --> 19:25.539
explosions...

19:27.750 --> 19:29.376
Nice try.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.211
That was a long time ago.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.255
Really?

19:36.717 --> 19:39.637
So, where does this go?

19:39.679 --> 19:42.098
Well, I suppose you could find

19:39.679 --> 19:42.098
out by crawling over the fence

19:42.140 --> 19:43.474
and following the fuse

19:43.516 --> 19:47.145
or you could find out

19:43.516 --> 19:47.145
the Francis way.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.023
We're sure you'll make

19:48.270 --> 19:50.023
the right decision.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.399
Guys, I'm telling you,

19:50.064 --> 19:52.399
things are different now.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.527
I'm married,

19:52.441 --> 19:54.527
I have responsibilities.

19:54.568 --> 19:57.279
I'm just not a 16-year-old

19:54.568 --> 19:57.279
maniac anymore who...

19:59.115 --> 20:01.075
Huh, interesting.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.548
Does anything

20:13.546 --> 20:15.548
look familiar, Otto?

20:15.589 --> 20:19.052
Just keep heading

20:15.589 --> 20:19.052
towards those mountains.

20:19.093 --> 20:21.179
Behind us

20:19.093 --> 20:21.179
is certain death.

20:25.307 --> 20:28.769
That's right,  this way

20:25.307 --> 20:28.769
is certain death.

20:28.811 --> 20:32.272
I wonder what that is.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.194
I'll tell you what that is.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.779
That is Francis

20:36.235 --> 20:38.779
showing us the way home.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.907
I told you

20:38.821 --> 20:40.907
he'd get us out of this.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.909
Yes, of course.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.909
Come on, come on.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.662
This may even top

20:44.326 --> 20:46.662
Homecoming '98.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.081
I don't know.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.999
That float

20:48.122 --> 20:49.999
smoldered for a week.

20:50.041 --> 20:53.293
How do we know which

20:50.041 --> 20:53.293
one's the Komodo 3000?

20:53.335 --> 20:54.587
(explosion)

21:01.552 --> 21:04.097
(yelling):

21:01.552 --> 21:04.097
Let's hope that was it.

21:04.138 --> 21:07.725
Did it say when our

21:04.138 --> 21:07.725
vision would come back?

21:07.767 --> 21:11.604
Box said two days.

21:11.645 --> 21:14.398
Totally worth it.
