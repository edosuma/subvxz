WEBVTT

00:15.133 --> 00:17.967
Oh, hello there.

00:18.033 --> 00:19.300
Today, we are going to see

00:19.367 --> 00:21.033
lots of frogs
on Sesame Street,

00:21.100 --> 00:25.633
so I am reading
to find out what frogs eat.

00:25.700 --> 00:27.367
Oh, do not bother me, fly.

00:27.433 --> 00:30.500
I am trying to find out
what frogs eat.

00:30.567 --> 00:31.867
Fly!

00:31.934 --> 00:33.500
I got it.

00:33.567 --> 00:34.900
Ah, thank you, froggy.

00:34.967 --> 00:37.233
Now I can finally read
about what frogs eat.

00:37.300 --> 00:38.467
Come on.

00:38.533 --> 00:40.734
Let's see more frogs
on Sesame Street.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.867
Flies...
Frogs eat flies.

00:42.934 --> 00:45.100

Wolfie:

01:19.533 --> 01:21.867
- Boy: Aww...

01:21.934 --> 01:25.867
Boy, dogs sure have fun.

01:25.934 --> 01:28.066
- Ribbit.

01:28.133 --> 01:30.467
Yeah. Go find Dad.

01:30.533 --> 01:31.734
Mmm!

01:31.800 --> 01:33.900
Oh, hey, welcome
to Sesame Street.

01:33.967 --> 01:36.734
Elmo and Abby are trying
my new vegetable soup recipe.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.934
Yeah.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.567
And it is delicious,
Chris.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.166
- Oh, perfection.
- Thank you, thank you.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.934
Ribbit ribbit ribbit.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.667
Hello.
- Hello.

01:46.734 --> 01:48.500
Do you happen
to serve dog food

01:48.567 --> 01:49.767
at this establishment?

01:52.166 --> 01:54.300
- Uh, excuse me.

01:54.367 --> 01:57.066
- Yeah.

01:57.133 --> 01:59.100
Frog.
Ha ha! Dear me.

01:59.166 --> 02:01.233
Whatever gave you
that idea?

02:01.300 --> 02:02.967
- I'm an adorable puppy.

02:03.033 --> 02:04.500
You may call me Fido.

02:04.567 --> 02:06.000
- Fi--
- Ribbit.

02:06.066 --> 02:07.667
Well, Fido,

02:07.734 --> 02:08.867
I just so happen to have

02:08.934 --> 02:10.633
a couple of doggy treats
I've been saving

02:10.700 --> 02:11.967
for a friend's Chihuahua.

02:12.033 --> 02:13.567
I'm sure they'd be
happy to share.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.033
- Ha ha!

02:15.100 --> 02:16.867
Ah!
- Bon appetit.

02:16.934 --> 02:19.533
Thank you, thank you,
thank you. OK. Um...

02:19.600 --> 02:20.867
Ugh...

02:20.934 --> 02:23.800
Hmm. Oh, no. Well, um,
OK. Let me try this.

02:23.867 --> 02:25.800
Heh heh. Ha ha ha!

02:25.867 --> 02:27.500
Um, whoa! Ohh!

02:27.567 --> 02:29.500
Oh, oh, Fido,
Fido, are you OK?

02:29.567 --> 02:30.800
Here you go. Here you go.

02:30.867 --> 02:32.367
OK. Wow.

02:32.433 --> 02:34.900
I seem to be having
a little difficulty
chewing on this.

02:34.967 --> 02:38.266
Uh, could that be
because you're a frog?

02:38.333 --> 02:39.800
Yeah. You know...

02:39.867 --> 02:41.700
frogs don't eat bones, Fido.

02:41.767 --> 02:43.800
- They eat things like--
- Bugs and flies.

02:43.867 --> 02:45.467
Bugs and flies, huh?

02:45.533 --> 02:47.800
Yuck! Gah! No way.

02:47.867 --> 02:49.367
Fido: I'm telling you,
I'm a dog.

02:49.433 --> 02:51.433
Fido, Elmo and Abby

02:51.500 --> 02:53.066
have seen lots
of frogs before,

02:53.133 --> 02:56.600
and Mr. Fido definitely
looks like one.

02:56.667 --> 02:59.633
Hey, um,
I have an idea.

02:59.700 --> 03:03.066
- Oh!

03:03.133 --> 03:05.400
I think I have
something

03:05.467 --> 03:07.867
right, ah-- here.

03:07.934 --> 03:09.200
Uh

03:09.266 --> 03:10.700
It's all about frogs.

03:10.767 --> 03:12.567
Oh, ho ho! Look Fido.

03:12.633 --> 03:14.667
There's pictures
of all kinds
of froggies.

03:14.734 --> 03:16.033
Mm

03:16.100 --> 03:18.834
Frogs have big eyes
on top of their heads.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.300
Just like Fido. Yeah.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.800
Big deal.
So, I have froggy eyes.

03:23.867 --> 03:25.300
OK. Um, well,

03:25.367 --> 03:27.400
here's what frog legs
and feet look like.

03:27.467 --> 03:28.533
Elmo: Yeah.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.700
Your legs look
like frog legs.

03:29.767 --> 03:31.066
- Yeah.

03:31.133 --> 03:33.834
Oh, oh, why,
how do you like that?

03:33.900 --> 03:37.033
I--I guess I'm a dog
with froggy feet.

03:38.633 --> 03:42.000
OK. Well, you've got
smooth skin, Fido,

03:42.066 --> 03:43.600
- just like a frog.
- Elmo: That's true.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.000
Most dogs are
covered with fur.

03:45.066 --> 03:46.700
- Yeah.
- Oh, well, ha ha ha!

03:46.767 --> 03:49.000
Have you ever heard
of a bulldog?

03:49.066 --> 03:51.967
- Maybe I'm a bald dog.

03:52.033 --> 03:54.200
Ha ha! Get it?
"Bald dog"?

03:54.266 --> 03:56.266
- Elmo: Oh.
- Oh, look. There's Wolfie!

03:56.333 --> 03:58.734
Now we can show Fido
what a real dog looks like.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.000
- Elmo: Yeah.
- Abby: Yeah.

04:00.066 --> 04:01.433
- Hey, Wolfie!
- Wolfie!

04:01.500 --> 04:03.600
- Come here, boy.
- Come on, Wolfie.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.133
And see, Fido?

04:08.200 --> 04:09.934
Dogs have tails
that they can wag.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.734
Yeah, oh--

04:11.800 --> 04:13.533
especially
when they're happy.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.266
Aww.

04:15.333 --> 04:17.133
OK, so, I don't
have a tail,

04:17.200 --> 04:18.834
but I can wag my behind.

04:18.900 --> 04:22.300
- Oh. Wow.
- Oh, ho ho ho!

04:22.367 --> 04:23.600
Oh, look,
look, look.

04:23.667 --> 04:26.100
Doggies can scratch
behind their ears.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.467
Oh, can Fido do that?

04:28.533 --> 04:31.667
Oh, well, I don't have
floppy ears like that,

04:31.734 --> 04:34.734
but I do have
tiny holes,

04:34.800 --> 04:36.633
see, on the side
of my head,

04:36.700 --> 04:39.533
but, of course,
I can scratch them.

04:41.333 --> 04:43.467
Watch this. Ha ha!

04:46.633 --> 04:48.667
Um...

04:48.734 --> 04:50.367
This is harder
than it looks.

04:56.934 --> 04:58.233
Ahh!

04:58.300 --> 04:59.867
Wolfie:

04:59.934 --> 05:02.100
Uh-oh.

05:02.166 --> 05:04.600
Please tell me
I didn't just
eat a fly.

05:04.667 --> 05:06.200
You did.

05:06.266 --> 05:08.166
I can't imagine
what came over me.

05:09.333 --> 05:10.300
Wait, but--

05:10.367 --> 05:13.100
Mmm...

05:13.166 --> 05:14.900
That fly is rather tasty.

05:14.967 --> 05:19.133
Oh, face it, Fido.
You are a frog.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.133
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.333
You should feel proud of it.

05:21.400 --> 05:22.400
Yeah. Frogs are
really cool.

05:22.467 --> 05:23.767
Ha ha ha!

05:23.834 --> 05:27.767
Well, I guess...
a frog is a pretty cool
thing to be. Yeah.

05:27.834 --> 05:29.567
Hey, Fido, did you know
that frogs can live

05:29.633 --> 05:31.533
in all kinds
of different places?

05:31.600 --> 05:33.900
They're called habitats.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.567
- Habitat.

05:36.633 --> 05:38.700
A habitat is a place
where you live

05:38.767 --> 05:41.100
and find food and water
and a place to sleep.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.233
Elmo: Uh-huh.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.900
Learning something new
every day. Ha ha!

05:43.967 --> 05:45.467
Check it out.

05:45.533 --> 05:48.533
Some frogs live in ponds...

05:48.600 --> 05:49.734
Elmo:
Yeah. That's right.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.500
Mm-hmm, and some frogs
live on rocks...

05:52.567 --> 05:53.767
Elmo: right.

05:53.834 --> 05:56.400
And some of them
live in bogs.

05:56.467 --> 05:57.800
Fido: Bogs

05:57.867 --> 06:01.033
A bog is a...
really mushy place.

06:01.100 --> 06:02.033
- Oh!
- Yeah.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.066
Really mushy place, yeah,

06:03.133 --> 06:05.433
and some live in the desert.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.767
- Ah.
- Ah.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.166
Hey, and check
this one out.

06:08.233 --> 06:10.967
Abby: Wait. Whoa!
Did you see that, Fido?

06:11.033 --> 06:13.667
- Some frogs live in trees.
- Yeah.

06:13.734 --> 06:16.734
Gee, I never knew frogs
could be so interesting.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.300
Wait a minute.

06:18.367 --> 06:20.800
Maybe Fido wanted
to be a doggy

06:20.867 --> 06:22.400
because Fido hasn't found

06:22.467 --> 06:24.767
the right habitat
to live in yet.

06:24.834 --> 06:27.166
Yeah, and maybe--

06:27.233 --> 06:29.200
Well, maybe Elmo
and I can help you

06:29.266 --> 06:30.200
find your habitat, Fido.

06:30.266 --> 06:31.400
Yeah.

06:31.467 --> 06:33.800
Oh, that would be wonderful.

OK, so, it says here
that some frogs

07:12.400 --> 07:13.767
live on rocks...

07:13.834 --> 07:15.600
and there's one right here.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.834
Ah, so maybe this
is your habitat, Fido.

07:17.900 --> 07:18.900
Elmo: Yeah.

07:18.967 --> 07:20.533
Why don't you
try the rock out?

07:20.600 --> 07:22.967
All right.

07:23.033 --> 07:25.300
Ribbit.

07:25.367 --> 07:26.900
Hmm.

07:26.967 --> 07:28.533
Nope. Um...

07:32.266 --> 07:35.900
Oh!

07:35.967 --> 07:38.033
Ouch! This rock is too hard.

07:38.100 --> 07:40.133
I guess living
on a rock isn't for me.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.333
Ribbit.

07:41.400 --> 07:42.967
Elmo: Oh, well,
don't worry, Fido.

07:43.033 --> 07:44.300
We're gonna find you
a habitat.

07:44.367 --> 07:45.400
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Uh--

07:45.467 --> 07:47.867
It says here that
lots of frogs live in water.

07:47.934 --> 07:49.000
Elmo:
But wait a minute--

07:49.066 --> 07:51.233
Where's Fido gonna swim
on Sesame Street?

07:51.300 --> 07:54.433
- Aw, that's easy. Ha ha!

07:54.500 --> 07:56.100
- Oh, ho ho!

07:56.166 --> 07:57.166
- Chris: Oh, boy.
- Fido: Oh.

07:57.233 --> 07:59.700
This froggy is gonna
feel real cool

07:59.767 --> 08:02.400
in a kiddie swimming pool.

08:02.467 --> 08:04.533
Zippity zap!

08:04.600 --> 08:07.200
- Oh. Oh, OK. I'll try it.
- OK.

08:09.333 --> 08:12.367
Fido:
Oh, it feels so wet.

08:12.433 --> 08:14.300
- Well, it's water.
- It's water.

08:14.367 --> 08:16.533
Oh. Um...
you know,

08:16.600 --> 08:18.600
I don't think water's
my habitat either.

08:18.667 --> 08:20.233
What else
can we try?

08:20.300 --> 08:21.767
- Uh, let's see. OK.
- Um...

08:21.834 --> 08:24.400
It says here that
some frogs live in trees.

08:24.467 --> 08:27.400
Hey, maybe Fido
is a tree froggy.

08:27.467 --> 08:29.233
- Yeah. Let's try that.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.033
- Yeah.
- Oh, OK.

08:31.100 --> 08:32.900
Ribbit!

08:32.967 --> 08:36.700
Whoa! Oh! Uh-uh,
uh-uh. Scared of heights!

08:36.767 --> 08:38.600
Elmo: What?
But--but--but--

08:38.667 --> 08:41.200
Oh. Aww, poor guy.

08:41.266 --> 08:43.934
Fido: Something tells me
that I'm not a tree frog,
either.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.467
Elmo: Oh, boy.

08:45.533 --> 08:48.867
Well, um, let's think
about this, huh?

08:48.934 --> 08:51.633
OK. Rocks are too hard,
and water's too--

08:51.700 --> 08:53.500
- Wet.
- Yeah.

08:53.567 --> 08:56.934
Well, maybe Fido needs
something in-between,

08:57.000 --> 09:00.433
something that's
kind of, um, mushy.

09:00.500 --> 09:03.066
Um, um, um, oh!
What about mud?

12:04.266 --> 12:05.200
...and we're here
to tell you

12:05.266 --> 12:07.467
all about the word,
"amphibian."

12:07.533 --> 12:09.000
Mm-hmm. Tell them
about the word,

12:09.066 --> 12:10.233
"amphibian," Conan.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.900
Tell them
about the word,
"amphibian"!

12:12.967 --> 12:14.367
All right, Abby.
Just--just calm down.

12:14.433 --> 12:15.600
I'll tell them.

12:15.667 --> 12:16.900
An amphibian is an animal

12:16.967 --> 12:18.900
that lives part
of its life on land,

12:18.967 --> 12:20.667
part of its life in water,

12:20.734 --> 12:23.233
and breathes
through its moist skin.

12:23.300 --> 12:27.633
Yes. Now show them
an amphibian, Conan.

12:27.700 --> 12:29.500
Uh, yeah.

12:29.567 --> 12:30.967
Abby, I'm sorry.
I don't have...

12:31.033 --> 12:32.300
any amphibians.

12:32.367 --> 12:34.533
What? You didn't
bring any amphibians?

12:34.600 --> 12:36.400
I didn't bring
the amphibians.

12:36.467 --> 12:39.100
Well, but,
you know what?
That's OK.

12:39.166 --> 12:40.734
Maybe I can use
some of my magic

12:40.800 --> 12:43.066
to bring
some amphibians.

12:43.133 --> 12:44.767
You can do that?

12:44.834 --> 12:48.133
Absolutely.
Watch this.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.333
Amphibian,
amphibian...

12:49.400 --> 12:52.400
amphibian!

12:52.467 --> 12:55.533
Whoa! Is that a toad?

12:55.600 --> 12:57.867
Yes. It is, Conan.

12:57.934 --> 13:00.967
Hey, a toad lives
part of its life in water,

13:01.033 --> 13:02.934
part of its life on land,

13:03.000 --> 13:05.600
and a toad breathes
through its moist skin.

13:05.667 --> 13:07.934
So a toad is...

13:08.000 --> 13:10.433
- an amphibian.
- An amphibian. Yeah.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.767
I can't believe you just
made an amphibian appear.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.467
Can you do that again?

13:14.533 --> 13:17.967
Why, sure. Amphibian.

13:18.033 --> 13:22.033
- Yeah.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.100
OK.

13:24.166 --> 13:27.500
A newt is an animal that lives
part of its life in water,

13:27.567 --> 13:29.500
part of its life on land,

13:29.567 --> 13:32.433
and it breathes
through its moist skin.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.934
So a newt is...

13:35.000 --> 13:37.333
- an amphibian.
- An amphibian. Yeah.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.667
This is unbelievable.

13:38.734 --> 13:40.233
All right.
Do it one more time.

13:40.300 --> 13:44.300
No problem...
Amphibian!

13:44.367 --> 13:47.200
Ta-da! Look, Conan.

13:47.266 --> 13:49.433
C

13:49.500 --> 13:51.100
Conan?

13:51.166 --> 13:54.367
What just happened?

13:54.433 --> 13:56.000
Um, Conan...

13:56.066 --> 13:58.633
I just turned you
into a frog.

13:58.700 --> 14:00.900
You mean,
I'm now a frog...

14:00.967 --> 14:02.467
who spends part
of my life

14:02.533 --> 14:03.500
living in water,

14:03.567 --> 14:04.800
part of my life
living on land,

14:04.867 --> 14:07.433
and I breathe through
my moist skin?

14:07.500 --> 14:11.400
Yep. Please don't be mad.
Please don't be mad, Conan.

14:11.467 --> 14:15.000
Mad? I'm not mad.
I'm...

14:15.066 --> 14:17.000
- an amphibian.
- An amphibian.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.633
Can you change me
back now, Abby?

14:20.700 --> 14:24.400
Well, why, sure.
