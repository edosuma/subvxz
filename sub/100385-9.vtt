Hi. I'm Larry David.

00:11.269 --> 00:13.478
I want to tell you about
a new store I'm opening

00:13.561 --> 00:14.978
called Latte Larry's.

00:15.061 --> 00:17.269
Why am I getting
into the coffee game?

00:17.353 --> 00:20.603
Because I went to this
coffee shop next door,

00:20.687 --> 00:22.895
and the guy was such a jerk

00:22.978 --> 00:25.395
that I felt like
I had to do something,

00:25.478 --> 00:27.353
and now, you know what?

00:27.436 --> 00:28.978
I got me a little spite store.

00:29.061 --> 00:31.061
Tremendous things
in here, by the way.
You're gonna love it.

00:31.144 --> 00:32.687
Look at this.
Coat rack.

00:32.770 --> 00:34.061

that anywhere?

00:34.144 --> 00:35.812

00:35.895 --> 00:37.853
And self-heating
coffee cups.

00:37.937 --> 00:39.520
Keeps coffee hot for two hours.

00:39.603 --> 00:42.645
Check out that sign.
This is a defecation-free store.

00:42.728 --> 00:44.436
That's the kind of feature
you dream about.

00:44.520 --> 00:45.395
No defecating!

00:45.478 --> 00:47.353
Urinators... welcome.

00:47.436 --> 00:49.019
But if you are a defecator,

00:49.103 --> 00:52.269
or planning on defecating
anytime soon,

00:52.353 --> 00:54.645

This is not your place.

of spite with me!

16:59.061 --> 17:02.687
Between the sweat
and then that whole
diarrhea incident--

17:02.770 --> 17:03.937
Okay, I'm just trying
to be a waitress,

17:04.019 --> 17:05.269
and I wait on you again--

17:05.353 --> 17:06.853
-(honks)
-Come on, asshole!

17:06.937 --> 17:08.520
I wait on you guys
all the time.

17:08.603 --> 17:09.937
I just figured
you would get it.

17:10.019 --> 17:12.353
No, no one, no one gets it.
No one's gonna get that.

17:12.436 --> 17:15.061
No one's down
with diarrhea, Diane!

17:15.144 --> 17:17.103
Okay. Well, now I know.
And now I--

17:17.186 --> 17:19.603
It cost me my job,
so now I'm... I've learned.

17:19.687 --> 17:21.520
So what are
you gonna do now?

17:21.603 --> 17:25.019
-I don't know.
I used to do retail, so...
-Yeah.

17:25.103 --> 17:26.645
I guess
maybe I won't do that.

17:26.728 --> 17:29.186
Hey, you...
You know what?

17:29.269 --> 17:31.395
I just opened up
a coffee shop.

17:31.478 --> 17:34.311
I could actually
use somebody in,
in the store.

17:34.395 --> 17:36.978
-If you're...
If you're interested.
-Really?

17:37.061 --> 17:39.395
I would, of-- Yeah.
I would, I would be interested.

17:39.478 --> 17:40.853
-Of course.
-You would?

17:40.937 --> 17:42.520
-You have AC?
-Yeah.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.061
-Great.
-Fantastic.

17:44.144 --> 17:45.436
It's just amazing to me

17:45.520 --> 17:47.228
-how things work out
sometimes, you know?
-Yeah.

17:47.311 --> 17:49.603
Hey, let me ask you
this question.

17:49.687 --> 17:51.395
Do you like licorice?

17:51.478 --> 17:53.061
Sometimes I like a black,

17:53.144 --> 17:55.186
and then I'll go weeks
with only wanting red.

17:55.269 --> 17:57.478
-Yeah.
-And then I switch
back to black.

17:57.561 --> 17:59.728
-Mr. David. What a surprise.
-Larry: Oh!

17:59.812 --> 18:02.228
-Hello!
-What's the problem today?

18:02.311 --> 18:05.228
-Well, uh...
-Let me guess.

18:05.311 --> 18:07.228
Another mysterious odor?

18:07.311 --> 18:09.561
Possibly a sound
like a snake?

18:09.645 --> 18:10.603
-No.
-No?

18:10.687 --> 18:12.895
-No. Actually...
-Yes?

18:12.978 --> 18:14.937
Looking for a new car.

18:15.019 --> 18:16.728
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

18:16.812 --> 18:19.395
And my friend Diane
is gonna help me
pick one out.

18:19.478 --> 18:20.770
She knows all about cars.

18:20.853 --> 18:22.144
She gets Motor Trend  magazine.

18:22.228 --> 18:23.895
-She reads all that stuff.
-Diane: I do.

18:23.978 --> 18:25.645
I know all the brands.

18:25.728 --> 18:27.770
And I'm so dissatisfied
with my car

18:27.853 --> 18:31.019
-because of everything
that you just alluded to.
-Uh-huh.

18:31.103 --> 18:32.436
-So you want a new car?
-Yeah.

18:32.520 --> 18:33.687
Well, why don't you
head on over there

18:33.770 --> 18:34.770
where the cars are.

18:34.853 --> 18:37.019
You know what?
I know where the cars are.

18:37.103 --> 18:38.144
Well, shall we go over there?

18:38.228 --> 18:39.937
Yeah, yeah.
We're gonna go over there.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.019
Great. Let's go.

18:41.103 --> 18:42.812
Oh, you gotta get
a piece of this.

18:42.895 --> 18:44.770
Oh, this is tremendous.
You gotta get a piece of this.

18:44.853 --> 18:46.228
-Okay. Wow.
-Yeah. Yeah.

18:46.311 --> 18:48.019
-What is this even?
-It's licorice.

18:48.103 --> 18:49.436
-Oh. Cool.
-Yeah.

18:49.520 --> 18:53.186
Why don't we shop
for a new car now?

18:54.228 --> 18:57.812
You know what?
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

18:57.895 --> 19:00.269
-This looks-- yeah, yeah.
-Right? Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Wonderful.

19:00.353 --> 19:02.311
-That looks good.
-That's wonderful.
That's wonderful.

19:02.395 --> 19:04.353
-That's a good one.
-Look at that.

19:04.436 --> 19:07.395
-Huh? How about that one?
-Diane: Yeah. Beautiful rims.

19:07.478 --> 19:09.311
-Larry: Yeah.
-This is so good.

19:09.395 --> 19:10.561
Yeah. Told you.

19:10.645 --> 19:11.728
Larry:
I think it's from Germany.

19:11.812 --> 19:13.019
Diane:
I want to get a red one.

19:13.103 --> 19:14.520
-Larry: Well, let's go. Yeah.
-Diane: Yeah.

19:14.603 --> 19:16.144
Look, you don't fool me,
Mr. David.

19:16.228 --> 19:20.144
-You're not here to buy a car.
-Well, you are mistaken, okay?

19:20.228 --> 19:21.770
I am here to buy
a new car.

19:21.853 --> 19:24.061
-Am I not buying a car?
-Yeah, what is-- What?

19:24.144 --> 19:26.186
I don't believe you
for a second.

19:26.269 --> 19:27.770
-Oh, you don't?
-That is correct.

19:27.853 --> 19:29.978
-I'm buying a car!
-Oh, really?
You're buying a car?

19:30.061 --> 19:31.311
-Uh, yes, I am.
-Which one?

19:31.395 --> 19:32.645
-Which one?
-Salesman: Yeah, which one?

19:32.728 --> 19:33.603
-Which one?
-That one!

19:33.687 --> 19:34.520
Yeah. That one!

19:34.603 --> 19:35.520
You're buying that one.

19:35.603 --> 19:36.645
Yeah, I'm buying that one.

19:36.728 --> 19:37.937
-The I-8.
-Yeah.

19:38.019 --> 19:39.603
-Yeah.
-That's a top-of-the-line car.

19:39.687 --> 19:40.812
That's why I'm buying it.

19:40.895 --> 19:41.645
You can drive that
off the lot right now.

19:41.728 --> 19:42.645
Okay. I will.

19:42.728 --> 19:43.478
Get the paperwork.

19:43.561 --> 19:44.478
I want it fully loaded.

19:44.561 --> 19:45.770
-Great choice.
-Good.

19:45.853 --> 19:47.395
-I'm not gettin'
a new car, huh?
-Larry,

19:47.478 --> 19:49.603
he bought it!
He totally thinks
you're buying a new car!

19:49.687 --> 19:51.478
I am buying a new car!

19:51.561 --> 19:54.520
-Really?
-Who does he think he is?
He can't talk to me like that!

19:54.603 --> 19:56.603
-Salesman: Congratulations.
-Thank you.

19:56.687 --> 19:58.103
-You are quite welcome.
-Yeah, okay.

19:58.186 --> 20:01.311
So you thought I was just
walking around the showroom,

20:01.395 --> 20:03.186
you know, eating licorice.

20:03.269 --> 20:04.687
-Right? Huh?
-You stepped up to the plate.
Now you got

20:04.770 --> 20:06.269
-a beautiful piece
of machinery right here.
-Yeah.

20:06.353 --> 20:08.478
-I got something else
for you. Hold on.
-Yeah.

20:10.436 --> 20:11.978
Oh, my God.

20:12.061 --> 20:13.687
-Look at this!
Licorice!
-Wow.

20:13.770 --> 20:15.144
-That's a nice touch.
-Wow.

20:15.228 --> 20:17.019
All right, you enjoy that.
Don't tell anybody else.

20:17.103 --> 20:18.812
-We don't like to give it out
to just anybody.
-Don't worry.

20:18.895 --> 20:20.561
-Congratulations. Yeah.
-All right. Thank you.

20:20.645 --> 20:22.186
-Drive safe.
-Okay.

20:22.269 --> 20:25.186
-Hey, look at this, huh?
-Wow.

20:25.269 --> 20:27.687
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

20:27.770 --> 20:30.395
Look what I got. Huh?

20:30.478 --> 20:32.812
Is this even me? This car?
I mean, look at it.

20:32.895 --> 20:34.436
A lot of the douchebags
at the club have it.

20:34.520 --> 20:37.311
No offense. But this is
a popular car at the club.

20:37.395 --> 20:39.395
Oh. Now I got the other car.
I got two cars.

20:39.478 --> 20:41.978
That's your biggest problem.
You got two cars. I mean--

20:42.061 --> 20:43.978
I don't even have one car.
I don't even know

20:44.061 --> 20:45.978
what bus I'm gonna take
to my new job.

20:47.395 --> 20:48.561
Okay.

20:48.645 --> 20:49.978
What?

20:51.478 --> 20:52.687
No.

20:52.770 --> 20:54.061
(keys clink)

20:54.144 --> 20:55.687
Yeah. Go ahead.

20:55.770 --> 20:57.061
-Take the car.
-Are you kidding?

20:57.144 --> 20:58.228
Take it! Take the car.

20:58.311 --> 20:59.311
Larry, this is n--

20:59.395 --> 21:00.895
-Huh? Yeah.
-I'm just gonna take it?

21:00.978 --> 21:02.812
This is worth
getting fired over.
Are you kidding me?

21:02.895 --> 21:04.895
This is an incredible day.
Thank you.

21:04.978 --> 21:06.895
I will see you at work.

21:06.978 --> 21:08.895
-I gave you a car!
-You just gave me a car!

21:08.978 --> 21:11.269
I gave you a car!
What's wrong with me?

21:11.353 --> 21:14.144
I don't think anything.
Uh, how do I get to
the freeway from here?

21:14.228 --> 21:16.019
Take a right,
then another right,

21:16.103 --> 21:18.103
then go through the light,
and second left.

21:18.186 --> 21:20.645
♪ ♪

21:40.269 --> 21:43.228
♪ ♪

21:55.061 --> 21:56.436
Go.

21:56.520 --> 21:58.812
What are you doing?
Come on.

21:58.895 --> 22:00.186
(mutters)

22:01.812 --> 22:03.478
(horn blares)

22:03.561 --> 22:05.103
(engine revs)

22:05.186 --> 22:07.687
(yelling)

22:07.770 --> 22:09.937
-Aah!
-Larry: What the fuck?

22:10.019 --> 22:11.687
Larry?

22:15.144 --> 22:16.353
Are you kidding?

22:16.436 --> 22:17.978
-You came out of nowhere.
-I came out of--

22:18.061 --> 22:19.645
-You were on your cell phone!
-Larry,

22:19.728 --> 22:21.311
you just went right through.

22:21.395 --> 22:23.019
I know exactly
what happened.
I saw it.

22:23.103 --> 22:24.311
I looked at you,
you were texting.

22:24.395 --> 22:26.269
Somebody beeped you,
you had beep panic,

22:26.353 --> 22:27.561
you threw the phone away.

22:27.645 --> 22:29.186
Look, there's your phone
right in the front seat.

22:29.269 --> 22:31.520
You threw it down.
And you were playing
Candy Crush!

22:31.603 --> 22:33.978
I've done it myself.
I just had beep panic
the other day.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.937
(clears throat)
Fine. They scared me,
behind me.

22:36.019 --> 22:37.395
-And I went. And I went!
-Of course. I know.

22:37.478 --> 22:39.019
-Okay. So okay.
-I know how it works,
so okay.

22:39.103 --> 22:41.103
So we've both done it.
I see it. I get it.

22:41.186 --> 22:42.770
All right.
I guess that, um,

22:42.853 --> 22:44.770
I mean, we should
exchange information.

22:44.853 --> 22:46.019
-What are you talking about?
-Well...

22:46.103 --> 22:47.186
It's all my information.

22:47.269 --> 22:48.687
Anyway, look at this.

22:48.770 --> 22:49.978
Nothing's wrong
with this car.

22:50.061 --> 22:51.853
There's a little dent
in the bumper, but...

22:51.937 --> 22:52.937
This is bad.

22:53.019 --> 22:54.353
-(sighs)
-Oh, my God.

22:54.436 --> 22:56.019
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna call the, uh,

22:56.103 --> 22:57.353
tow company.

22:57.436 --> 22:59.978
I'll get the new one towed,
and, and then I'll...

23:00.061 --> 23:01.603
I'll, you know,
I'll take you home.

23:01.687 --> 23:03.228
Your cars is the one
that's being towed.

23:03.311 --> 23:06.103
-How are you gonna
drive me home?
-I'll drive you home in my car.

23:06.186 --> 23:07.478
This is my car.

23:07.561 --> 23:09.853
(scoffs)
Come on.
What do you--

23:09.937 --> 23:12.019
-This is my--
You just gave me this car.
-What do you mean it's your car?

23:12.103 --> 23:14.603
Yes, I gave it to you
with very good intentions,

23:14.687 --> 23:16.186
until you wrecked my car!

23:16.269 --> 23:18.103
-You gave me the car,
so it's my car.
-Are you serious?

23:18.186 --> 23:19.395
-Are you serious?
-What?

23:19.478 --> 23:21.061
You just give away cars
and take 'em back?

23:21.144 --> 23:23.728
Oprah doesn't just
give out cars and then
take them back.

23:23.812 --> 23:26.103
Does that seem fair to you
that I gave you a car,

23:26.186 --> 23:28.061
you hit my new car,
and now I don't have a car?

23:28.144 --> 23:30.728
-That seems fair?
-I, I don't know.
What is fair?

23:30.812 --> 23:33.061
-No.
-What's fair is for things
to go back to the way,

23:33.144 --> 23:35.061
the way they were
15 minutes ago...

23:35.144 --> 23:38.603
-Well, I didn't have a car
15 minutes ago and now I do.
-...when I had a car.

23:38.687 --> 23:40.228
Well, I would love
to give you a ride home.

23:40.311 --> 23:41.645
I would love to give you
a ride home.

23:41.728 --> 23:43.853
Well, how are you gonna
do that without a car, Larry?

23:45.353 --> 23:47.395
(sighs)
Please take me home.

23:47.478 --> 23:48.812
-Okay.
-Thank you.

23:50.478 --> 23:53.311
-It's unbelievable.
Now I gotta get a new car.
-Uh-huh.

23:53.395 --> 23:55.186
I'm gonna get rid of
that new one,

23:55.269 --> 23:57.228
and I'm gonna buy
the same car I had before.

23:57.311 --> 23:58.603
Why don't you just
drive your old car?

23:58.687 --> 23:59.812
I gave it away.

23:59.895 --> 24:01.812
When you tell
a motherfucker
that story,

24:01.895 --> 24:03.895
you should say,
"Lo and behold."

24:03.978 --> 24:05.645
When a motherfucker says,
"Lo and behold,"

24:05.728 --> 24:08.770
-it makes me fuckin' react.
-Oh, that is such
a good observation.

24:08.853 --> 24:10.978
-"Lo and behold..."
-Yeah. Lo and behold,

24:11.061 --> 24:13.061
I gotta buy my,
my old car new.

24:13.144 --> 24:15.436
Now the story don't sound
so far-fetched and shit.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.561
Hey, how many pieces
of licorice have you had?

24:17.645 --> 24:18.978
Maybe about eight.

24:19.061 --> 24:20.937
I haven't seen you take
one piece of red licorice yet.

24:21.019 --> 24:22.853
-Only black for you?
-Fuck, yeah.

24:22.937 --> 24:24.311
Everything's black,
isn't it? Right?

24:24.395 --> 24:27.311
Something wrong with a person
supporting black and shit?

24:27.395 --> 24:29.812
Black licorice,
black jelly beans,

24:29.895 --> 24:31.395
fuckin' blackouts,

24:31.478 --> 24:33.770
burnt toast.
I don't give a fuck,
I eat burnt toast.

24:33.853 --> 24:35.144
Oh, so you must love
pumpernickel.

24:35.228 --> 24:37.436
Oh, fuck yeah.
I take that piece
of burnt-ass toast,

24:37.520 --> 24:39.603
put it between two pieces
of fuckin' pumpernickel,

24:39.687 --> 24:41.937
have a burnt-toast
pumpernickel sandwich.

24:42.019 --> 24:44.103
-You feel me?
-Oh, I feel you.

24:44.186 --> 24:45.478
Hey, when are you going
on that golf trip?

24:45.561 --> 24:46.645
You know, I've been
thinking about it.

24:46.728 --> 24:48.478
Jeff's not going.
I'm not gonna go.

24:48.561 --> 24:49.645
-Oh.
-It's ridiculous.

24:49.728 --> 24:50.895
That big motherfucker's
the glue.

24:50.978 --> 24:51.937
Yeah, he's the glue.

24:52.019 --> 24:54.019
Mm. Jesus.

24:54.103 --> 24:57.728
Boy, my stomach's
really bothering me.

24:58.895 --> 25:01.895
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh. Hey. That's Mocha Joe.

25:01.978 --> 25:05.269
He wants to talk to me.
So, um, do me a favor.

25:05.353 --> 25:07.395
-Keep an eye on him.
I don't trust this guy.
-Yeah.

25:07.478 --> 25:08.520
-All right?
-You're right.

25:08.603 --> 25:09.770
I don't trust him, either.

25:09.853 --> 25:11.728
Larry:
So, Mocha Joe,

25:11.812 --> 25:13.728
what can we do for you?

25:14.603 --> 25:16.019
Does he have to be here?

25:16.103 --> 25:18.103
-I was hoping
we could talk alone.
-Larry: Yeah, well,

25:18.186 --> 25:19.561
he's a business associate.

25:19.645 --> 25:23.103
We actually refer to him
as the bean-meister.

25:23.186 --> 25:25.561
-He's always staring at me.
-Larry: I wouldn't
worry about it.

25:25.645 --> 25:27.436
-He stays.
-All right, look.
You know,

25:27.520 --> 25:29.019
I've been thinking about this,
what's going on between us,

25:29.103 --> 25:30.603
-and I just wanna...
-(stomach rumbling)

25:30.687 --> 25:33.353
-(Leon chuckles)
-...say that, uh,
I think we need to...

25:33.436 --> 25:34.603
(stomach gurgling)

25:34.687 --> 25:35.853
Mocha Joe:
It's time that we, uh...

25:35.937 --> 25:37.770
-(gurgling)
-Aah!

25:38.478 --> 25:40.520
-Mocha Joe:
Something wrong?
-(yells)

25:40.603 --> 25:42.561
-(groans)
-(loud gurgling)

25:43.687 --> 25:45.978
Mocha Joe:
You okay? You don't look good.

25:46.061 --> 25:48.603
Aah, just excuse me
just for a second.

25:49.728 --> 25:51.353
-(stomach gurgling)
-Larry: Aah!

25:51.436 --> 25:52.645
(yells):
Oh!

25:52.728 --> 25:55.770
(Larry groaning loudly)

25:56.812 --> 25:59.561
(pained groaning continues)

26:00.812 --> 26:02.770
(Larry yells)

26:02.853 --> 26:04.561
You think maybe
you should check on him?

26:04.645 --> 26:06.019
(whispers):
He's good.

26:07.061 --> 26:09.311
(stomach gurgling)

26:09.395 --> 26:10.812
(groans)

26:10.895 --> 26:12.103
You okay?

26:12.186 --> 26:15.186
-I'm fine.
-(stomach gurgling)

26:15.645 --> 26:17.603
(Leon groans)

26:20.353 --> 26:21.561
You don't look too good.

26:21.645 --> 26:24.061
-(panting)
-(stomach gurgling loudly)

26:24.144 --> 26:26.061
(grunting)

26:26.144 --> 26:28.228
-If you will excuse me...
-Mocha Joe: Sure thing.

26:28.311 --> 26:30.353
-(stomach gurgling)
-(Leon moans)

26:30.978 --> 26:33.478
-(door closes)
-(Leon groaning)

26:33.561 --> 26:35.687
(pained moaning)

26:35.770 --> 26:40.978
(Larry and Leon moaning
and groaning)

26:42.561 --> 26:45.561
(yelling and moaning
continues)

27:06.853 --> 27:09.019
(toilet flushes)

27:18.603 --> 27:21.353
(toilet flushes)

27:24.186 --> 27:25.436
Ooh.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.061
Where is he?

27:27.144 --> 27:28.478
I don't know.

27:28.561 --> 27:29.687
Mocha Joe!

27:29.770 --> 27:31.645
You were supposed to watch him!

27:31.728 --> 27:33.353
My belly started
to fuckin' bubble.

27:33.436 --> 27:35.103
I couldn't control myself!

27:37.728 --> 27:40.353
-(stomachs gurgling)
-(both yelling)

27:42.561 --> 27:45.645
(yelling and moaning continues)

27:45.728 --> 27:47.061
(door closes)

27:47.144 --> 27:48.770
I come out of the bathroom...

27:48.853 --> 27:50.895
-(claps)
-...he's not there.

27:50.978 --> 27:52.311
Not there.

27:52.395 --> 27:53.812
He's just negotiating.

27:53.895 --> 27:56.144
That's negotiating?
On what planet
is that negotiating?

27:56.228 --> 27:58.812
I do it with my mattress guys.
I have 'em out there
pounding cotton.

27:58.895 --> 28:01.144
And, uh, family throws out
a quote they don't like,

28:01.228 --> 28:02.478
I tell 'em to just
get out of there,
walk away.

28:02.561 --> 28:03.978
Mocha Joe's not negotiating.

28:04.061 --> 28:05.645
That sucker's got
something up his sleeve.

28:05.728 --> 28:08.311
Now, let's talk about
something that we're
all excited about--

28:08.395 --> 28:10.520
a little magical place
called Pebble Beach.

28:10.603 --> 28:12.853
By the way, I, I'm not
gonna go on the golf trip.

28:12.937 --> 28:14.561
-Why not?
-I don't wanna go
with three guys.

28:14.645 --> 28:16.353
All right, you don't
wanna do three,
we'll find a fourth.

28:16.436 --> 28:18.520
Okay, you know what?
It, it's not even that.

28:18.603 --> 28:19.978
I, I don't wanna do it
without Jeff.

28:20.061 --> 28:21.687
Jeff was the glue, anyway.
Let's face it.

28:21.770 --> 28:23.520
-His absence will be felt.
-That's true.

28:23.603 --> 28:25.311
I wasn't that thrilled
about going, either,

28:25.395 --> 28:27.436
-without Jeff.
Maybe it's best for me.
-See?

28:27.520 --> 28:30.436
I do have the play coming up
and I gotta study my lines.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.937
Can we prevail upon you
to give us a...

28:33.019 --> 28:34.269
a little snippet?

28:34.353 --> 28:35.353
-The role?
-Larry: Yeah.

28:35.436 --> 28:36.520
I'd love to see the process.

28:36.603 --> 28:37.687
Freddy wants to see it.

28:37.770 --> 28:39.353
Aah, that's a little unfair.
I mean, look,

28:39.436 --> 28:41.186
-the people are around here--
-Larry: Yeah, so what?

28:41.269 --> 28:42.645
-Come on, Charlie.
-Richard: Nah, no.

28:42.728 --> 28:45.144
Yoo-hoo, Charlie!
Charlie, are you in there?

28:45.228 --> 28:49.061
Charlie! Char-- Charlie!

28:50.520 --> 28:54.061
I'm gonna get that operation.
You know why?

28:54.144 --> 28:58.395
'Cause I'm smart.
I'm smarter than that mouse,
that stupid mouse.

28:58.478 --> 29:00.937
-(laughs)
-(laughs)

29:01.019 --> 29:03.561
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Why are you laughing?

29:03.645 --> 29:05.395
Jeez, a compliment.
You have a natural touch.

29:05.478 --> 29:07.561
-It was the initial response.
But it's very good.
-Freddy: Yeah.

29:07.645 --> 29:11.019
-It was hilarious.
-It's not hilarious.
I'm a-- It's dramatic.

29:11.103 --> 29:12.353
It was very moving, then.

29:16.728 --> 29:18.645
-(Susie chuckles)
-Wow.

29:18.728 --> 29:19.937
-What do you know?
-Look who's here.

29:20.019 --> 29:21.353
-Coming for a little lunch?
-Susie: Yeah.

29:21.436 --> 29:22.436
What the hell is this?

29:22.520 --> 29:23.603
Oh, this is my loaner car.

29:23.687 --> 29:25.144
-Yeah, but it's white.
-Larry: So what?

29:25.228 --> 29:27.269
The color of a car
doesn't really matter to me,

29:27.353 --> 29:30.311
because I don't really see it
when I'm inside the car.

29:30.395 --> 29:31.728
It's like being inside
your face.

29:31.812 --> 29:33.103
I don't know what
my face looks like.

29:33.186 --> 29:34.186
Who forgets their face?

29:34.269 --> 29:35.770
I'm in a capsule.
I don't know.

29:35.853 --> 29:37.895
Everything's coming from
inside the capsule.

29:37.978 --> 29:39.728
So the outside of the car
is a mystery to me.

29:39.812 --> 29:42.061
I don't believe you
for a fucking second.

29:42.144 --> 29:43.895
And I think you're obsessed
with the white car,

29:43.978 --> 29:45.937
-and you're embarrassed by it.
-Larry: Hey, by the way,

29:46.019 --> 29:47.937
our little golf trip
to Pebble Beach...

29:48.019 --> 29:50.186
-Yeah?
-...has been canceled.

29:50.269 --> 29:51.603
Boo-fucking-hoo.

29:51.687 --> 29:53.770
Yeah, anyway, you know,
I have something for you here

29:53.853 --> 29:55.603
-you might enjoy. Yeah.
-Really?

29:55.687 --> 29:56.895
-Here you go.
-What is this?

29:56.978 --> 29:58.561
It's only the best licorice
in the world.

29:58.645 --> 30:01.520
It comes from Bavaria.
You'll never taste
anything like it.

30:01.603 --> 30:03.895
Turn the TV on,
put that in front of you,

30:03.978 --> 30:05.770
and, and you will
enjoy yourself.

30:05.853 --> 30:08.478
-All right, well, thank you,
Lar. I appreciate it.
-All right. Okay. Sure.

30:08.561 --> 30:11.311
Have a nice day
in your white car.

30:11.395 --> 30:12.603
By the way,
I don't see the hood.

30:12.687 --> 30:14.603
-By the way,
I don't believe you.
-Yeah.

30:14.687 --> 30:15.853
-Bye, Lar.
-Bye.

30:15.937 --> 30:17.019
-Thank you.
-Sure.

30:17.103 --> 30:18.144
What the fuck am I
gonna do with this?

30:18.228 --> 30:19.687
I hate licorice.
It's disgusting.

30:19.770 --> 30:21.812
Larry:
Cappuccino for Katie!
Cappuccino for Katie!

30:21.895 --> 30:23.395
Cappuccino for Katie .

30:23.478 --> 30:27.436
Okay, coffee and a croissant.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.019
Larry, we need to charge
the self-heating cups.

30:29.103 --> 30:30.561
Where's Diane?
She's supposed to be here.

30:30.645 --> 30:31.853
I have no idea where she is!

30:31.937 --> 30:34.895
Oh, my God.
What is wrong with her?

30:34.978 --> 30:36.311
(phone chimes)

30:36.395 --> 30:38.645
-Oh, hey, Larry.
-Larry (over phone):
Where are you?

30:38.728 --> 30:41.937
Oh! Oh, my goodness.
I totally forgot.

30:42.019 --> 30:44.311
I'm so sorry.
I was gonna call you.

30:44.395 --> 30:47.228
I'm actually not gonna
come in anymore.

30:47.311 --> 30:49.895
-What? What are you
talking about?
-I just wanna travel

30:49.978 --> 30:52.061
while I have the chance
before I get another job.

30:52.144 --> 30:53.353
-You have a job!
-I'm thinking of

30:53.436 --> 30:55.395
going to Europe
or maybe Thailand.

30:55.478 --> 30:57.311
Europe? You can't go to Europe!
You don't have any money.

30:57.395 --> 30:59.186
Well, actually,
I sold my car.

30:59.269 --> 31:01.269
Oh, my God.
You sold my car?

31:01.353 --> 31:03.311
-Are you kidding?
-Well, it was actually my car,

31:03.395 --> 31:06.687
and I sold it on eBay,
which I didn't know you
could even do.

31:06.770 --> 31:08.728
-What the fuck?
-It was pretty low mileage.

31:08.812 --> 31:11.853
-So I got a lot for it.
-I gave it to you so you'd
have something to drive.

31:11.937 --> 31:13.019
'Cause I was a nice guy.

31:13.103 --> 31:14.520
Well, I don't need
to drive anymore,

31:14.603 --> 31:15.728
'cause I'm going on this trip.

31:15.812 --> 31:17.144
Aah!

31:17.228 --> 31:18.520
-Hey, uh, we're out of napkins.
-(scoffs)

31:18.603 --> 31:19.895
Barista:
They're in the back.

31:20.436 --> 31:21.812
Next?

31:23.103 --> 31:24.937
Hello? Next!

31:25.603 --> 31:26.353
Sir?

31:26.436 --> 31:27.603
-Hey!
-Oh.

31:27.687 --> 31:29.019
(chair whirring)

31:29.103 --> 31:30.353
-(yells)
-Man: I'm sorry.

31:30.436 --> 31:32.061
-Larry: Oh, fuck!
-Man: I'm sorry. I am sorry.

31:32.144 --> 31:34.353
-Aah! Aah.
-I'm so, so sorry.

31:34.436 --> 31:35.853
Larry:
Weren't you looking
where you're going?

31:35.937 --> 31:38.186
Man:
You just came out of nowhere.
You all right?

31:38.269 --> 31:41.395
-No. No, I'm not.
-I apologize.

31:41.478 --> 31:43.478
Oh, okay.
Is that your phone?

31:43.561 --> 31:45.687
I see what happened.
You were on your cell phone,

31:45.770 --> 31:48.228
and somebody yelled, "Next,"
and you panicked, right?

31:48.311 --> 31:50.478
Yes. I had "next panic," okay?

31:50.561 --> 31:53.311
Ow. Jeez. Aah.

31:53.395 --> 31:56.186
(scoffs)
I may never walk
normal again.

31:56.269 --> 31:57.812
You know, nothing personal.

32:02.687 --> 32:04.478
Are you Larry David?

32:05.144 --> 32:06.520
What? Yeah?

32:06.603 --> 32:09.061
Mr. David,
does look familiar?

32:09.144 --> 32:11.395
What? It's a screener.

32:11.478 --> 32:13.395
These screeners are
digitally marked with your name,

32:13.478 --> 32:15.728
and there are copies of these
appearing all over town.

32:15.812 --> 32:17.520
Impossible!
Impossible.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.353
I, I didn't give them
to, to anyone!

32:19.436 --> 32:20.770
-We got some questions
for you, sir.
-What?

32:20.853 --> 32:22.186
Questions? What kind of--

32:22.269 --> 32:23.269
This is ridiculous!

32:23.353 --> 32:24.937
Hey, my goodness.
What are you doing?

32:25.019 --> 32:28.478
You know, you're treating me
like a war criminal,
for God's sake.

32:30.353 --> 32:31.311
That's him.

32:31.395 --> 32:33.103
He did it.
He took my screeners.

32:33.186 --> 32:34.436
-Took 'em from my house.
-This guy.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.603
Yeah, this guy.

32:35.687 --> 32:36.978
I had too much licorice
from Bavaria,

32:37.061 --> 32:38.269
and it gave me diarrhea,

32:38.353 --> 32:39.561
and when I was in the bathroom,

32:39.645 --> 32:40.478
he took the screeners!

32:40.561 --> 32:42.687
Licorice? Bavaria?

32:42.770 --> 32:44.478
I really hope you get
the help you need.

32:44.561 --> 32:47.144
-That's the guy who--
He was in my house!
-In the car.

32:47.228 --> 32:48.937
Thanks, guys.
I really appreciate
what you do.

32:49.019 --> 32:50.103
Bye, Larry.

32:50.186 --> 32:52.186
Stop sending people over
to shit in my store!

32:52.269 --> 32:54.269
(siren blares)

32:54.353 --> 32:56.478
Richard:
That's insanity.
For a screener?

32:56.561 --> 32:58.019
They can't fine you that much.

32:58.103 --> 32:59.269
Larry:
Well, they did.

32:59.353 --> 33:00.895
The FBI, they can do
whatever they want.

33:01.019 --> 33:02.895
What are you gonna do?
I'm, I'm lucky I'm not in jail.

33:02.978 --> 33:04.311
-(knocking)
-Ten minutes.
Ten minutes.

33:04.395 --> 33:05.978
All right, thanks.

33:06.061 --> 33:07.978
-Have a good show, Richard,
See you out there.
-You, too, buddy.

33:08.061 --> 33:09.978
Break a leg.
How does my makeup look?

33:10.061 --> 33:12.311
What's, uh,
what's happening
with the hair?

33:12.395 --> 33:13.645
It's Charlie's hair.

33:13.728 --> 33:15.478
Charlie looks like
he spends a lot of time

33:15.561 --> 33:16.978
at off-track betting.

33:17.061 --> 33:19.853
Well, that's reassuring
five minutes before I go on.

33:19.937 --> 33:21.728
How dare you.
You're like a rabbi

33:21.812 --> 33:23.645
heckling me at my bar mitzvah.

33:23.728 --> 33:25.103
What is this?

33:25.186 --> 33:26.645
-This? That tin?
-Larry: Yeah.

33:26.728 --> 33:28.144
It's licorice.
Susie gave it to me.

33:28.228 --> 33:31.186
-Oh. Did she?
-Richard: It's delicious.

33:31.269 --> 33:33.687
-You ate this whole thing?
-Yeah, in about five hours.

33:33.770 --> 33:35.520
I'd give you one,
but I'm a little anxious,

33:35.603 --> 33:36.645
so I ate all of 'em today.

33:36.728 --> 33:38.311
I think I'm
a licorice addict now.

33:38.395 --> 33:39.561
Oh, my gosh.

33:39.645 --> 33:40.853
Why? What's wrong?

33:41.895 --> 33:43.144
Nah. Nothing.

33:43.228 --> 33:44.228
(pops lips)

33:44.311 --> 33:46.228
-Richard:
Well, thanks for coming.
-Yeah.

33:46.311 --> 33:48.061
Okay. Yeah. Break a leg.

33:48.144 --> 33:51.103
Hey, don't be depressed.
If you want some, you know,
it's German licorice.

33:51.186 --> 33:53.978
-It's the best. All right.
-Yeah, I know where it's from.

33:54.395 --> 33:56.853
It's showtime, Charlie.

33:56.937 --> 33:58.019
(stopwatch ticks, stops)

33:58.103 --> 33:59.436
Algernon beat you.

33:59.520 --> 34:00.853
You lost, Charlie.

34:00.937 --> 34:03.687
Does that mean that
I won't get the operation?

34:03.770 --> 34:05.186
'Cause I lost?

34:05.269 --> 34:07.144
I can do better than that.

34:07.228 --> 34:10.228
I want that operation.
I, I wanna be s-s-s...

34:10.311 --> 34:11.603
smart.

34:11.687 --> 34:14.186
We'll have to see what
Professor Nemur says,
Charlie.

34:14.269 --> 34:16.812
I'm not afraid of the operation.

34:16.895 --> 34:20.061

34:20.144 --> 34:21.395
Oh!

-I, I ain't afraid of nothing.

34:30.603 --> 34:32.019

-Oh.

34:32.103 --> 34:34.019
Did you want to say something
about being right?

34:34.103 --> 34:35.978
