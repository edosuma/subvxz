WEBVTT

00:56.014 --> 00:57.974
What did you do?!

01:32.676 --> 01:34.511
<i>Harriet Jacobs writes,</i>

01:34.552 --> 01:36.721
<i>"I was born a slave,</i>
<i>but I never knew it</i>

01:36.805 --> 01:40.308
<i>till six years of happy</i>
<i>childhood had passed away."</i>

01:41.184 --> 01:43.895
I think what's interesting
is how Ms. Jacobs

01:43.937 --> 01:46.731
ignited the compassion
for those still in bondage,

01:46.815 --> 01:49.401
exciting Northern white women
and men -

01:49.484 --> 01:51.027
with the plight
of the slave girl.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.320
So...

01:54.280 --> 01:57.826
Shay, can you please control
your environment?

02:00.745 --> 02:01.913
Jasmine.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.750
My bad.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.003
All right,

02:08.086 --> 02:09.963
let's wrap it up here for today.

02:10.046 --> 02:12.173
Next week, you'll be discussing
Paul Laurence Dunbar's poem

02:12.257 --> 02:14.551
- "Sympathy"...
- Yeah.

02:14.592 --> 02:17.178
So, uh...

02:17.262 --> 02:18.304
right now?

02:18.388 --> 02:19.764
This early, hmm?

02:21.266 --> 02:22.726
In the morning, it's medicine.

02:24.102 --> 02:27.439
Just not while
I'm in class, okay?

02:29.649 --> 02:30.608
Still pending?

02:30.650 --> 02:33.570
-Still pending.
-Shit.

02:33.611 --> 02:36.906
-All of them?
-Yep.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.575
Everything slowed down.

02:38.616 --> 02:41.745
And the center cut my hours.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.788
Well, don't worry.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.875
I got my financial aid
coming in next month, so...

02:46.958 --> 02:49.169
Mm, nice for you.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.338
Gold Grant withheld mine.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.590
So what's the point
of Gold Grant then

02:53.631 --> 02:55.800
if we can't even get
the classes that we need?

02:55.884 --> 02:57.302
I'm only taking one class,

02:57.344 --> 03:00.430
and they didn't offer one
I needed to transfer.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.599
Let's get out of here and move
to Atlanta or something.

03:02.640 --> 03:06.561
I mean, realistically, neither
of us can afford to move.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.855
Because we are big broke.

03:10.690 --> 03:14.235
The beauty of being broke

03:14.319 --> 03:16.488
is that we can
be broke anywhere.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.532
You hear me?

03:20.325 --> 03:22.494
I'm serious, Shay.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.621
What's keeping you here?

04:15.880 --> 04:16.965
Shay?

04:17.007 --> 04:19.217
Oh, I'm so glad I caught you.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.219
Hi. I'm Kate Simmons.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.929
Uh, hi.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.974
Sorry, am I
supposed to know you?

04:26.057 --> 04:28.643
Oh, um, I got your application
on Sitter Search.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.186
-Oh.
-And I read your bio.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.604
I checked all your references.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.440
It turns out
I know your boss Christopher.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.316
We went to high school together.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.403
I was just here
asking about you.

04:39.612 --> 04:42.240
So, uh, which listing were you?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.868
It's the Hopkins estate.

04:44.909 --> 04:46.661
Here.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.336
Yeah, I, uh...

04:54.419 --> 04:55.712
I know this place.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.839
I know it's not
the most colorful photo,

04:57.922 --> 05:00.592
but, uh, it's not
a plantation anymore.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.218
It's been in the family
for generations.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.887
Generations?

05:03.970 --> 05:05.555
But it's really just a home.
It's just walls and a window--

05:05.597 --> 05:08.183
I mean, all that stuff
is long gone.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.685
I see that your rate is between
15 and 20 dollars an hour,

05:10.769 --> 05:15.273
and I-I'll pay you $200 just
to come up and-and meet the kids

05:15.357 --> 05:17.817
and tour the house.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.486
Two hundred?

05:19.569 --> 05:20.904
I will pay for your car
both ways.

05:20.945 --> 05:21.905
And just come up,

05:21.946 --> 05:23.531
and if you're not
feeling the vibe,

05:23.615 --> 05:25.867
then you'll still get paid.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.036
Got it.

05:28.078 --> 05:30.413
Okay. See you after your work.

05:50.809 --> 05:52.394
<i>Are you insane?</i>

05:52.477 --> 05:53.978
We need the money.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.773
You said
it's a slave plantation, Shay.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.692
-Need I say more?
-Was.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.735
And relax. I'm not gonna
actually take a job

06:00.819 --> 06:03.780
babysitting a bunch of
white kids at a plantation.

06:03.822 --> 06:05.240
Like, no.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.283
Then why are you going?

06:07.325 --> 06:10.328
Because I still get paid
200 bucks.

06:10.412 --> 06:12.163
How do we know
she's not a nutcase?

06:12.247 --> 06:13.832
All right, I get it.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.751
-I'll send you my location.
-Thank you.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.005
Peace.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.967
As a Black man,
I agree with the girl.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.345
What, were you eavesdropping?

06:27.387 --> 06:28.680
You guys were loud.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.682
Well, cover your ears.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.101
I'm just saying that,
uh, you know,

06:33.184 --> 06:36.855
in this climate of racial
injustice, especially down here,

06:36.896 --> 06:39.024
it's not a good look.

06:39.065 --> 06:42.819
Well, maybe you should
keep an eye on the road.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.866
Well...

06:49.034 --> 06:51.494
...racism is harder
for brothers like me.

06:51.536 --> 06:54.039
-Expectations, you know?
-How so?

06:54.122 --> 06:55.290
I can't ball.

06:55.373 --> 06:56.958
I can't dance.

06:57.042 --> 06:59.002
It's horrible.

06:59.044 --> 07:02.297
Which is why I rely on
my most charming,

07:02.380 --> 07:04.674
undeniably adorable personality.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.177
If you need a ride,
just let me know.

07:07.218 --> 07:10.889
I'll be your personal chauffeur.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.740
Check it out.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.580
Mass graves.

07:35.663 --> 07:38.249
Where they buried the slaves.

07:38.333 --> 07:41.127
Damn, they couldn't
even give us a proper burial.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.237
Boys, come inside now.

08:13.952 --> 08:17.038
Um, what's up with this kid?

08:24.671 --> 08:26.631
Andrew, now.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.967
Yeah, now, Andrew.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.433
Well...

08:36.474 --> 08:38.476
there goes massa
and her chil'ren.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.478
Shut up.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.734
Can you just...

08:45.817 --> 08:47.652
wait till I get back?

08:47.736 --> 08:49.320
Yeah. 20 minutes.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.573
Then you're on your own.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.742
Okay.

09:10.675 --> 09:13.136
Thank you for coming.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.849
Come in.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.685
I can't imagine
what it must be like for you

09:20.769 --> 09:22.896
to be in a place like this.

09:22.979 --> 09:26.024
I'm only here because
my mother is dying,

09:26.107 --> 09:29.027
and I wanted to be with her
in her final days.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.154
I'm sorry.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.948
Uh, I mean, after the upgrades,

09:34.032 --> 09:36.910
I'm not really sure what
we're gonna do with this place.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.871
It was weird growing up here.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.498
Please don't judge me.

09:42.374 --> 09:45.168
We don't get to choose
where we grow up.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.047
Let me show you the house.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.923
Mind your step.
We're renovating.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.591
We're in the electrical phase.

10:33.675 --> 10:37.971
The connections are spotty, so
it causes the lights to flicker.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.392
This is our fun little
arts and crafts project.

10:42.434 --> 10:44.728
It keeps the kids busy.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.358
My husband cannot wait
for this debacle to be over.

10:50.442 --> 10:51.818
This is not his thing.

10:51.901 --> 10:55.280
He comes and goes from L.A.

10:56.948 --> 11:00.076
But, um, let me show you
the rest of the house.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.972
That room's a mess.

11:21.056 --> 11:23.141
Haven't gotten around
to that room yet.

11:25.935 --> 11:30.440
Springfield Model 1861 rifle.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.819
These belonged to
my great-granduncle.

11:34.903 --> 11:37.405
Fought in the Civil War?

11:37.489 --> 11:39.032
Killed in action.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.659
This was taken
when his body was returned.

11:41.743 --> 11:42.660
Whoa.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.537
Mourning portrait.

11:44.621 --> 11:45.580
That's wild.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.165
It's a way to honor those

11:47.207 --> 11:49.334
that have passed on
to the other side.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.586
How do you know so much
about this stuff?

11:51.670 --> 11:55.173
-Uh, I'm an African American
studies major. -Hmm.

11:55.256 --> 11:58.259
Focus more
on the Civil War era, but...

11:58.343 --> 12:01.763
Yeah, I've only seen these
in, like, textbooks.

12:03.515 --> 12:04.516
His wife?

12:04.599 --> 12:06.184
Mm-hmm.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.353
My mother loved
to show this off.

12:08.436 --> 12:11.356
She fancied herself
on Southern tradition.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.192
I never really understood
her pride about it.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.197
The heat is insufferable
in here.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.409
-Let me get you a fan.
-Oh. Thanks.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.819
Can you hear anything?

13:39.903 --> 13:42.155
Oh.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.491
Hey, you.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.078
What's your name?

13:50.705 --> 13:52.832
I'm Shay.

13:53.625 --> 13:54.626
I'm Blair.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.128
Nice to meet you, Blair.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.964
You have such a pretty smile.

14:00.048 --> 14:01.549
Want to play hide-and-seek?

14:01.633 --> 14:04.386
There's a lot of good places
to hide in this house.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.721
Um...

14:06.805 --> 14:08.181
yeah, sure.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.266
It didn't break!

14:15.647 --> 14:16.648
Boys.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.988
What you doing there, buddy?

14:24.030 --> 14:26.574
-I'm a pirate.
-Mm.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.660
Pirates are pretty cool.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.705
What about you?
You a pirate, too?

14:31.788 --> 14:34.332
No. I-I'm just Andrew.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.002
Hey.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.087
Stop it! Stop it.

14:39.170 --> 14:40.672
-Andrew, stop.
-You know,

14:40.714 --> 14:44.634
a weapon like that is
used against brave pirates.

14:44.676 --> 14:47.095
Last one holding it
has to walk the plank.

14:47.178 --> 14:49.180
Go wash your hands!

14:53.059 --> 14:55.770
What is that?

14:55.854 --> 14:58.523
It's a, uh, branding iron.

14:58.606 --> 15:01.276
I don't know where they even
find something like this.

15:01.359 --> 15:03.862
Well, we are on a plantation.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.780
Yeah.

15:06.698 --> 15:08.908
I think they used to have
horses here maybe.

15:12.537 --> 15:15.040
With soap.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.924
Okay.

15:27.052 --> 15:29.429
Just need to get you
cleaned up, honey.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.431
Mom, it's hot.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.809
It's too hot!

15:34.893 --> 15:37.062
Okay, Mom. Okay, okay, okay.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.356
Okay.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.734
Who wants lemonade?

15:42.776 --> 15:44.402
-Oh, me.
-Me.

15:44.486 --> 15:45.862
I hate lemonade.

15:45.904 --> 15:48.406
Shay, do you want in
on this lemonade party?

15:48.490 --> 15:49.282
Yeah.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.493
That actually sounds good.

15:56.748 --> 15:58.541
They're great kids, I promise.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.501
They really are.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.920
It's just...

16:02.003 --> 16:04.923
just the move, and I've had
to drive them to the hospital.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.133
To be honest, I don't think
they really understand

16:07.217 --> 16:08.301
what's going on and...

16:08.385 --> 16:10.261
long days turn into late nights,

16:10.345 --> 16:12.764
and when I finally get them
in bed and I crash,

16:12.847 --> 16:15.016
they're up all night, just
opening and closing the doors

16:15.100 --> 16:16.601
and flushing the toilet.

16:16.685 --> 16:19.104
I mean, how many times
can one person use the bathroom?

16:20.814 --> 16:25.985
Well, I'm not really
a great sleeper, either, so...

16:26.069 --> 16:27.737
It's really tough on Andrew.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.990
He gets these nightmares.

16:34.119 --> 16:35.412
I'm sorry.

16:35.453 --> 16:38.081
I'm supposed to be
selling you on this job.

16:38.123 --> 16:41.167
Ugh. I'm not usually
such an oversharer.

16:41.251 --> 16:46.631
Uh, my mom passed
when I was younger, so I get it.

16:46.715 --> 16:48.425
It takes a toll.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.137
Here you go, as promised.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.639
Thank you.

16:54.723 --> 16:57.434
I hope it works out, because
you seem really good with kids

16:57.475 --> 17:00.395
and I think the diversity
could be good for them.

17:01.730 --> 17:04.566
I'm gonna stop talking, but I-I
really enjoyed having you here.

17:04.649 --> 17:05.650
Take care.

17:05.734 --> 17:07.235
You, too.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.843
Waited, hmm?

17:31.926 --> 17:35.096
Only 'cause you fine, girl.

18:17.389 --> 18:19.224
Shay.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.601
What are you up to?

18:21.685 --> 18:24.354
I'm just looking up stuff
on the Hopkins estate.

18:24.396 --> 18:25.730
And you wonder why

18:25.772 --> 18:28.692
you have crazy nightmares
about this stuff.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.947
I thought you weren't
taking that job.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.824
I'm not.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.953
You know what's weird, though?

18:40.036 --> 18:43.206
That you're spending
your free time reading about

18:43.248 --> 18:46.167
sugarcane crop yields
in the fall of 1859

18:46.251 --> 18:47.919
for a job you're not taking.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.046
I've looked everywhere.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.464
Like, literally everywhere,

18:51.548 --> 18:53.925
and I can't find any information
on this place.

18:54.009 --> 18:56.219
If I kidnapped people
and forced them to work for me,

18:56.261 --> 18:59.639
I don't think I'd be too eager
to write it down, personally.

18:59.723 --> 19:01.433
I'm saying, lots of money
would've come from

19:01.474 --> 19:02.892
a plantation that size.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.186
There's no way there wouldn't be
any record of it.

19:05.270 --> 19:06.771
I love you, Shay,

19:06.813 --> 19:09.816
but I cannot watch you go down
one of your loops again.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.359
Loops?

19:11.443 --> 19:13.778
I mean, sometimes you get
a little bit obsessive.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.281
You start digging into
some Civil War thing,

19:16.364 --> 19:18.783
and then after that,
things get weird.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.785
This is different.

19:22.537 --> 19:25.206
It's something about this place.

19:25.290 --> 19:28.084
I feel drawn to it.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.463
It's weird.

20:04.996 --> 20:07.248
Kill my life.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.716
- Hello.
- Hi, Shay. It's Kate.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.843
I'm so, so sorry.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.804
Wh-What is it?

20:20.845 --> 20:23.098
My mother took a turn
for the worse,

20:23.181 --> 20:26.017
and, um, she may not make it
through the night.

20:26.101 --> 20:27.936
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:28.019 --> 20:30.814
So my husband's flying in, but
he can't get here till tomorrow.

20:30.897 --> 20:34.734
Is there... is there any way you
can come and spend the night?

20:35.985 --> 20:37.320
Right now?

20:37.362 --> 20:38.863
Yeah, uh,

20:38.947 --> 20:41.282
I have to go to St. Gabriel's,
but the kids are asleep,

20:41.366 --> 20:43.785
and, um, I'll be back
tomorrow morning.

20:43.868 --> 20:46.454
Mm... um...

20:47.205 --> 20:49.541
Yeah, I'm-I'm not sure, Kate.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.502
I'll pay you $500.

20:52.544 --> 20:55.296
Please, Shay.
I have no one else to call.

21:03.388 --> 21:05.682
Where are you going this late?

21:08.393 --> 21:10.020
You're back with Will.

21:10.061 --> 21:12.063
Hell no. Please.

21:12.147 --> 21:13.815
Then where?

21:15.066 --> 21:17.193
Kate's house.

21:17.235 --> 21:18.570
Vanilla Kate?

21:18.653 --> 21:21.197
Yes, Cream Soda Jasmine.

21:21.239 --> 21:22.824
This late?

21:22.907 --> 21:26.161
It's only for a night,
and she's paying me 500 bucks.

21:26.244 --> 21:27.662
No. No.

21:27.746 --> 21:29.497
What happened to
Miss "I'm not babysitting

21:29.581 --> 21:31.458
some white kids
at a plantation"?

21:31.541 --> 21:33.293
I'm driving you.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.378
I already called a car.

21:36.588 --> 21:39.090
Seriously, dude, don't go.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.885
Girl, you only want me to stay
because you're high

21:41.926 --> 21:43.803
and too scared to watch
this movie by yourself.

21:43.887 --> 21:46.389
No, I'm just hungry.

21:47.599 --> 21:50.101
Well, there's a burrito
in the freezer.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.394
You'll be good.

21:51.436 --> 21:52.479
Bye, Jas.

21:52.562 --> 21:54.064
Okay, then I'm going with you.

21:54.105 --> 21:57.025
Kate's never met you.
She's not going for that.

21:57.108 --> 21:59.110
Okay, fine.

21:59.194 --> 22:02.781
You call me as soon as you get
there and check in with me.

22:02.822 --> 22:03.907
Okay.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.241
Don't go to sleep,

22:05.283 --> 22:08.828
and keep an eye on everyone.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.416
Anything else?

22:13.458 --> 22:15.960
Do not go in there.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.837
In where?

22:18.838 --> 22:21.216
You'll know when you see it.

22:21.299 --> 22:22.342
Oh, God. Okay.

22:22.425 --> 22:24.594
Well, bye.

22:27.222 --> 22:28.306
Mm-mm.

22:56.918 --> 22:59.462
So you're actually gonna
spend the night there?

23:00.839 --> 23:02.173
Mm-hmm.

23:02.966 --> 23:06.011
It's good money,
and I don't scare easily.

23:28.033 --> 23:31.536
Okay, well, if you need
anything, just call me.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.121
No matter what.

23:33.204 --> 23:34.372
I'm your guy.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.541
I'll be here...

23:53.558 --> 23:55.268
- Thank you for coming...
- Oh.

23:55.352 --> 23:56.394
...on such short notice.

23:56.436 --> 23:57.479
Don't worry about me.

23:57.562 --> 23:59.689
Just go be with your mom.

24:06.571 --> 24:08.907
Okay.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.934
So, keep track of
any movements by them.

24:36.017 --> 24:38.728
They should sleep through
the night, except Andrew.

24:38.770 --> 24:42.399
He randomly gets up,
like, 3:00 a.m.-ish.

24:42.440 --> 24:44.526
And like an episode
or something?

24:44.609 --> 24:46.194
No, it's-it's like
a night terror,

24:46.277 --> 24:47.529
but then it passes.

24:47.612 --> 24:49.114
It only started
when we moved here.

24:49.155 --> 24:52.117
Um, this is the police
department, fire department,

24:52.200 --> 24:54.494
and St. Gabriel's,
where I'll be.

24:54.577 --> 24:56.913
Um, here's a list
of approved snacks.

24:56.955 --> 24:59.290
And would you like a water?

25:03.044 --> 25:04.546
Oh.

25:07.173 --> 25:10.135
Um, here is, uh,
their morning routine.

25:10.218 --> 25:13.054
No devices before 9:00 a.m.
I should be back by noon.

25:13.138 --> 25:15.557
I didn't want to wake them up,
so if they do wake up,

25:15.640 --> 25:18.393
just call me,
and I'll talk to them.

25:18.476 --> 25:19.519
Okay.

25:19.602 --> 25:21.146
So, you can hang out in here.

25:21.229 --> 25:23.732
Extra blankets
are in the cabinet.

25:23.815 --> 25:25.650
Um, make yourself at home.

25:25.734 --> 25:28.319
Feel free to eat anything
in the fridge.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.488
If they want to sleep in my bed,
that's okay.

25:30.572 --> 25:33.074
Um, I think that's that.

25:34.034 --> 25:35.577
Thank you again.

25:35.660 --> 25:38.621
-And I'll call you when I can.
-'Kay.

27:50.128 --> 27:53.715
What the hell am I doing
in this strange-ass house?

29:41.448 --> 29:43.241
Damn, it's hot.

30:06.765 --> 30:09.100
Please, please. I'm sorry.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.561
-No.
-Blair?

30:13.355 --> 30:15.190
I'm sorry.

30:18.443 --> 30:19.611
I'm sorry.

30:19.694 --> 30:21.571
I'm sorry. Please. It's too hot!

30:21.613 --> 30:23.114
-Blair.
-It's too hot!

30:23.198 --> 30:24.282
Blair!

30:25.533 --> 30:26.785
What are you doing?

30:26.868 --> 30:28.244
You could've
really hurt yourself.

30:28.286 --> 30:30.413
She told me to clean myself.

30:30.455 --> 30:31.956
She who?

30:31.998 --> 30:33.750
You mean your mom?

30:34.668 --> 30:38.672
She told me to wash it off,
every single bit of it.

30:38.755 --> 30:40.840
Wash what off?

30:43.968 --> 30:46.137
Blair, wash what off?

30:48.223 --> 30:49.641
You.

30:59.401 --> 31:01.486
Oh, oh.

31:01.528 --> 31:04.197
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

31:10.036 --> 31:12.455
Oh. You scared me.

31:12.497 --> 31:15.083
I told you to check in.

31:15.166 --> 31:18.461
Sorry, I'm just still
looking around this house.

31:18.503 --> 31:20.839
You're looking around
that creepy-ass plantation

31:20.922 --> 31:22.298
by yourself?

31:22.340 --> 31:23.717
Shay.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.093
What?

31:25.176 --> 31:27.137
Did Shay stay home
to take this job

31:27.178 --> 31:29.681
to conduct
her own investigation?

31:29.723 --> 31:30.807
No.

31:30.849 --> 31:32.308
We need the money.

31:33.268 --> 31:35.812
You are so lying, Shay.

31:35.854 --> 31:38.440
You're freaking obsessed.
I told you.

31:38.523 --> 31:41.109
Stop being extra, please.

31:41.192 --> 31:43.695
Uh-uh. I just don't want you...

31:43.778 --> 31:45.155
to get extra murdered.

31:45.196 --> 31:46.614
Look, everything's fine.

31:48.700 --> 31:51.536
-Mostly.
-Mostly?

31:52.454 --> 31:54.205
It's just...

31:54.289 --> 31:56.666
the little girl, Blair, she...

31:58.084 --> 31:59.878
...she said something weird
to me.

31:59.961 --> 32:01.379
What?

32:05.383 --> 32:07.093
-It doesn't matter.
-Mm-mm.

32:07.177 --> 32:08.762
It matters.

32:08.845 --> 32:12.265
Whenever a kid tells you
something in a creepy house,

32:12.349 --> 32:16.728
you take that shit seriously
100% of the time.

32:16.770 --> 32:20.065
And you would be the
world's most trash babysitter.

32:23.193 --> 32:24.444
I saw that look.

32:24.527 --> 32:27.072
Something is not right
in that house.

32:27.155 --> 32:28.615
You feel it, too.

32:31.076 --> 32:32.577
All right. Okay.

32:32.619 --> 32:35.372
You want to see?

32:35.455 --> 32:36.956
There you go.

32:37.707 --> 32:39.250
You're just proving my point.

32:39.334 --> 32:41.878
The house is just old, really.

32:41.920 --> 32:45.298
It... has electrical problems.

32:47.717 --> 32:50.303
Jas? Jas?

32:52.972 --> 32:54.557
Did...

32:54.599 --> 32:57.310
-Did you just make that noise?
-What? What noise?

32:58.561 --> 32:59.896
No.

32:59.938 --> 33:01.398
No. No, no, no.

33:01.439 --> 33:02.941
Okay, you got me trippin'.

33:03.024 --> 33:05.151
Um, I'm hearing
all this crazy stuff now.

33:05.235 --> 33:06.486
I'm gonna have to call you back.

33:06.569 --> 33:08.988
No! Shay, wait, don't!
You can't...

34:15.472 --> 34:17.098
Hello?

34:26.858 --> 34:28.735
Where'd you come from?

34:28.818 --> 34:30.320
You okay?

34:30.362 --> 34:32.530
I had a bad dream.

34:34.783 --> 34:35.950
I'm sorry.

34:37.535 --> 34:39.371
You want to talk about it?

34:53.009 --> 34:55.053
Is my mom home?

34:55.136 --> 34:58.306
No, she went to go check
on your grandma.

34:58.390 --> 35:00.892
She'll be back soon, though.

35:00.934 --> 35:02.686
So who's knocking?

35:04.896 --> 35:07.190
No one's knocking.

35:08.233 --> 35:10.235
It was probably in your dream.

35:10.318 --> 35:13.238
Why don't you crawl back
into bed, okay?

35:45.937 --> 35:47.022
Mom?

35:47.105 --> 35:49.566
Does no one in this house sleep?

35:58.783 --> 36:00.243
Is that you?

36:00.285 --> 36:02.370
Hey, Chase.

36:02.454 --> 36:04.581
Your mom went to the hospital.

36:04.622 --> 36:05.999
Who are you?

36:06.082 --> 36:08.001
It's... Shay.

36:08.084 --> 36:09.127
Stay back.

36:09.210 --> 36:11.046
It's okay.

36:11.129 --> 36:13.298
It's okay. It's me. Remember?

36:13.340 --> 36:14.674
We met earlier.

36:14.758 --> 36:16.468
I'm just here
to keep an eye on you guys

36:16.509 --> 36:18.011
until your mom comes back.

36:18.094 --> 36:20.305
Okay?

36:24.893 --> 36:27.937
Did you get that
out of the trash from earlier?

36:29.105 --> 36:30.857
-Hey, Kate.
-Hey.

36:30.940 --> 36:33.068
I'm just waiting for the doctor,
so I only have a minute.

36:33.151 --> 36:34.611
Um, how is everything?

36:36.112 --> 36:37.864
Mom.

36:37.947 --> 36:40.492
It's 3:00 a.m., Chase.
Why are you still awake?

36:40.575 --> 36:42.744
Did you take that
out of the garbage?

36:44.829 --> 36:45.789
No.

36:45.830 --> 36:47.874
It was in my room.

36:47.957 --> 36:49.167
Okay, listen to me.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.335
Give it to Shay,

36:50.377 --> 36:53.088
wash your hands,
and go to sleep.

36:53.171 --> 36:54.339
I love you, buddy.

36:54.422 --> 36:56.341
I love you more.

36:59.678 --> 37:02.430
Uh, okay. Uh, where were we?

37:02.514 --> 37:04.599
Um, everything's fine.

37:04.683 --> 37:06.518
It's just--
something happened with Blair.

37:06.559 --> 37:07.894
- Miss Simmons?
- Oh, I got to go.

37:07.977 --> 37:08.978
- Here's the doctor.
- It's time.

37:10.397 --> 37:12.732
Okay.

37:20.073 --> 37:23.368
All right, that's enough
excitement for the night.

37:23.451 --> 37:26.371
I don't like that Mom's gone.

37:26.454 --> 37:30.417
I know, but she'll be home
before you know it.

37:30.500 --> 37:34.671
And if you sleep,
it'll go by faster.

37:35.839 --> 37:40.010
Fine. But tell her to wake me up
the minute she gets home.

37:40.051 --> 37:42.262
I will.

37:43.054 --> 37:44.639
Night, Chase.

37:56.067 --> 37:58.570
Blair, that better not be you.

38:50.205 --> 38:52.457
You got to be kidding me.

39:08.014 --> 39:10.725
Hopkins.

39:21.444 --> 39:23.613
What are you hiding from me?

39:48.304 --> 39:50.515
Miss Shay?

39:50.557 --> 39:52.684
Are you okay?

39:53.893 --> 39:56.062
You're up again?

39:57.355 --> 39:59.315
Your mom was not kidding.

39:59.357 --> 40:01.026
I'm hungry.

40:06.239 --> 40:10.035
I, um, saw your drawings.

40:10.118 --> 40:11.953
Very talented.

40:12.954 --> 40:15.957
My mom said
I needed a creative outlet.

40:17.083 --> 40:19.044
I get it.

40:19.085 --> 40:21.171
I have a few of those.

40:22.172 --> 40:24.841
And you're into history.

40:24.924 --> 40:27.177
Which is cool.

40:27.218 --> 40:29.054
I'm into history, too.

40:31.473 --> 40:32.974
What's that saying?

40:33.058 --> 40:36.728
Those who don't learn history
are doomed to repeat it?

40:40.231 --> 40:41.608
Okay.

40:41.691 --> 40:44.235
Let's go family history.

40:46.738 --> 40:48.865
America the beautiful.

40:55.497 --> 40:57.082
"Mangham."

41:12.514 --> 41:14.891
Hello?

41:14.974 --> 41:17.477
Oh, um, right.

41:18.478 --> 41:20.063
Sorry.

41:20.105 --> 41:21.439
Milk first.

41:21.481 --> 41:23.066
Okay.

41:24.984 --> 41:26.194
Only a little.

41:26.986 --> 41:29.280
Got it.

41:31.074 --> 41:34.953
And, um, where do you keep
your silverware?

41:51.845 --> 41:54.139
Where'd you get that?

42:04.315 --> 42:06.943
Is this what was in your dream?

42:13.408 --> 42:15.160
Andrew...

42:17.996 --> 42:20.999
...you dreamt about
the same door as I did.

42:22.667 --> 42:24.502
Um...

42:24.586 --> 42:27.005
where's your mom
keep the extra...

42:29.758 --> 42:31.968
What the hell was that?

42:34.179 --> 42:35.347
I see her!

42:35.388 --> 42:38.099
Oh.

42:38.892 --> 42:41.603
Thought I saw something outside.

42:50.612 --> 42:52.906
What is it?

42:58.286 --> 43:00.413
Where'd it go?

43:04.501 --> 43:05.877
I want my mom.

43:34.572 --> 43:38.410
It's so meant to be.

43:38.451 --> 43:40.412
Oh, my God.

43:43.331 --> 43:45.250
I'm on my way, my queen.

43:52.757 --> 43:55.635
When will Mom be home?

43:55.719 --> 43:57.637
<i>Not until morning.</i>

43:57.721 --> 44:00.223
Try to get some sleep now.

44:13.028 --> 44:14.779
I can't sleep.

44:15.947 --> 44:18.241
Of course you can't.

44:21.953 --> 44:24.205
How about a bedtime story?

44:25.165 --> 44:27.792
My mom used to read me bedtime
stories if I couldn't sleep.

44:27.834 --> 44:29.669
Do you miss her?

44:29.753 --> 44:31.755
I heard she went to heaven.

44:34.382 --> 44:36.676
Yeah. I, um...

44:36.760 --> 44:39.179
miss her more than anything.

44:39.971 --> 44:42.098
I miss my best friend.

44:42.140 --> 44:43.767
I bet.

44:46.144 --> 44:48.772
But you'll find another one.

44:50.648 --> 44:52.150
Mommy did not like her.

44:52.233 --> 44:54.903
She would not let her
come into the house.

44:56.321 --> 44:57.489
Why not?

45:14.839 --> 45:16.341
Um...

45:18.510 --> 45:20.303
It's okay.

45:21.262 --> 45:23.181
Don't be sad.

45:24.724 --> 45:26.476
You...

45:26.518 --> 45:28.103
You still have the memories.

45:30.814 --> 45:32.399
Are you my best friend?

45:32.482 --> 45:35.068
I totally could be.

45:35.151 --> 45:37.445
Oh, let's play a game.

45:37.529 --> 45:39.197
It's my favorite.

45:39.280 --> 45:41.366
-I'll teach you the words.
-Okay.

45:47.080 --> 45:49.290
Uh...

45:49.374 --> 45:53.253
I'm not sure
that's a good song to sing.

45:54.337 --> 45:57.340
I mean, there's just a lot
of history behind it, and...

46:02.846 --> 46:04.222
You know what?

46:04.264 --> 46:09.227
How about you sing
and I'll clap with you?

46:33.877 --> 46:35.962
-What?
-Shh.

46:37.922 --> 46:39.924
She's awake.

46:39.966 --> 46:41.092
We have to hide.

46:41.176 --> 46:43.928
-Come on.
-Who's awake?

46:44.596 --> 46:46.222
Come on.

46:54.481 --> 46:56.608
I think she heard us.

46:57.859 --> 46:59.778
Who?

46:59.861 --> 47:02.447
You're not supposed
to be in here.

47:03.365 --> 47:05.283
Blair,
what are you talking about?

47:05.325 --> 47:09.162
She'll kill me if she finds out
you're in here.

47:09.245 --> 47:10.955
Your mom?

47:10.997 --> 47:13.458
Blair, your mom's
at the hospital.

47:17.629 --> 47:18.963
Okay.

47:19.005 --> 47:21.299
This is ridiculous.

47:41.069 --> 47:43.029
Don't go.

47:52.038 --> 47:53.790
No, no, no, no!

47:53.832 --> 47:56.042
Help me! Help me!
Somebody, help!

47:58.670 --> 48:00.463
Help me! Help me!

48:10.682 --> 48:13.476
Shit. Shit.

48:14.811 --> 48:16.354
Oh, shit.

49:11.701 --> 49:13.119
911.
What's your emergency? -Hello.

49:13.203 --> 49:14.788
Please, you have to come
and help me.

49:14.871 --> 49:16.206
I'm stuck.

49:16.247 --> 49:17.749
I'm stuck in this house,
and I can't get out.

49:17.832 --> 49:19.542
Please help me. Please, someone.

49:19.584 --> 49:21.086
- I can't hear you.
- Hello?

49:21.169 --> 49:22.545
-You're breaking up.
-No, no.

49:22.587 --> 49:24.756
No. Oh, please.

49:24.798 --> 49:26.091
Someone, help me.

49:28.385 --> 49:29.636
No.

49:29.719 --> 49:31.137
The kids.

49:31.221 --> 49:32.681
The kids. No, the kids.

49:44.150 --> 49:45.694
Blair?

50:02.794 --> 50:04.295
It's happening.

50:04.337 --> 50:07.465
Shh. Just... be quiet.

50:07.549 --> 50:10.468
-We got to help her.
-No, she's crazy.

50:10.552 --> 50:12.971
No, she isn't.

50:13.013 --> 50:15.140
There is something out there.

50:17.350 --> 50:19.310
You're as crazy as she is.

50:20.103 --> 50:22.564
Andrew? Chase?

50:22.605 --> 50:24.065
Where are you guys?

50:26.651 --> 50:28.153
Boys?

50:32.073 --> 50:33.366
Boys?

50:34.868 --> 50:36.244
Open the door.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.663
Go away!

50:38.705 --> 50:40.832
Open the door. Come on.
We have to leave right now.

50:40.874 --> 50:43.209
Look, I'm just trying
to get us out of here, okay?

50:43.293 --> 50:45.837
All of this started
when you got here.

50:46.629 --> 50:48.965
Please don't do this right now.

50:49.007 --> 50:50.675
Okay, where's Blair?

50:50.759 --> 50:52.677
Just go away, you psycho!

50:53.678 --> 50:54.721
Okay.

50:54.804 --> 50:56.681
Okay, I'm gonna
get us out of here.

50:56.723 --> 50:58.058
Just... just stay.

50:58.141 --> 51:00.393
Stay in here until I get back.

51:04.773 --> 51:07.525
What the hell is going on?

51:15.784 --> 51:20.538
When Mom comes home,
I'm so getting my own room.

51:31.758 --> 51:33.718
Shay.

51:37.222 --> 51:39.307
Blair?

51:45.188 --> 51:46.856
I'm in here.

52:07.585 --> 52:08.920
Damn it.

53:14.569 --> 53:16.112
- You were right.
- Jas.

53:16.154 --> 53:17.655
-Jas. Jas. Jas, listen to me.
-It was called "Mangham,"

53:17.739 --> 53:19.199
and there was
some crazy shit before.

53:19.282 --> 53:20.658
Full-on slave revolt.
They escaped.

53:20.700 --> 53:23.286
And a crazy-ass woman
got pissed, went insane,

53:23.328 --> 53:24.537
-and tried to kill everyone.
-J...

53:24.621 --> 53:26.206
Jas, I need you to call 911.

53:26.289 --> 53:27.832
-Jas.
-Shay? Shay, can you hear me?

53:27.874 --> 53:28.958
Jas, call

53:29.042 --> 53:30.126
- 911.
- Hello? Shay?

53:30.168 --> 53:31.419
I can't hear you.

53:31.503 --> 53:33.004
Shay!

53:33.046 --> 53:36.174
Tell them Hopkins, Mangham.

53:36.257 --> 53:38.510
Jas? Shit, Jas, shit.

53:38.593 --> 53:41.179
-Shay? I'm coming to get you.
-Jas.

54:37.777 --> 54:39.612
Wh-What are...

54:42.449 --> 54:44.743
It's locked.

54:44.826 --> 54:46.327
What? No.

55:22.238 --> 55:24.449
Come on, bitch.

57:02.464 --> 57:03.923
Shay, it's, uh, it's Patrick.

57:04.007 --> 57:06.843
Patrick. Patrick. Patrick.

57:06.926 --> 57:08.345
Patrick, help!

57:08.386 --> 57:09.804
I got your keys.

57:09.888 --> 57:11.556
Help. Help.

57:30.116 --> 57:31.910
Shay?

57:32.827 --> 57:34.662
Shay?

57:37.082 --> 57:38.083
Shay?

58:54.325 --> 58:56.828
We're going through
the window over there!

58:56.870 --> 58:59.039
Shit.

58:59.122 --> 59:01.166
- Come on!
- I'll do it!

59:19.059 --> 59:20.643
Oh.

59:35.992 --> 59:37.160
Shay?

59:38.078 --> 59:39.662
Shay?

59:39.704 --> 59:41.706
-Patrick. Patrick.
-Are you okay?

59:41.790 --> 59:43.750
-Patrick, call 911.
-Wh-What happened?

59:43.833 --> 59:45.293
Don't come in here.
Stay outside.

59:45.377 --> 59:47.796
-Hold on. I got you. I got you.
-Please call 911.

59:47.879 --> 59:49.214
What? Wh-Why?

59:49.297 --> 59:50.548
Patrick, don't. Pl...

59:50.632 --> 59:52.008
Stay outside!

59:52.759 --> 59:54.052
No!

59:54.135 --> 59:56.012
Patrick!

01:00:11.695 --> 01:00:13.571
Andrew?

01:00:13.613 --> 01:00:14.572
Chase?

01:00:17.367 --> 01:00:18.410
Blair?

01:00:18.451 --> 01:00:20.745
Where are you?

01:00:26.751 --> 01:00:28.294
Blair?

01:00:45.687 --> 01:00:46.938
Blair.

01:00:47.647 --> 01:00:48.940
Blair.

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:06.416
She'll hear you.

01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:08.418
You must stay hidden.

01:01:49.834 --> 01:01:50.877
Blair.

01:02:27.914 --> 01:02:29.541
Andrew, don't.

01:02:48.977 --> 01:02:51.187
Cannot believe I came here.

01:02:51.229 --> 01:02:54.232
Dealing with this haunted
<i>Gone with the Wind</i> shit.

01:03:24.971 --> 01:03:27.140
Andrew. Andrew. Andrew, listen.

01:03:27.223 --> 01:03:29.392
It's not okay to be
up here, okay? Okay?

01:03:30.727 --> 01:03:31.728
Okay.

01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:33.021
Chase. Chase, open the door!

01:03:33.104 --> 01:03:35.273
-Open the door, Chase!
-Leave me alone!

01:03:35.357 --> 01:03:36.941
Okay. Okay.

01:03:37.025 --> 01:03:39.277
We're gonna stay in here.

01:03:56.294 --> 01:03:58.630
Hey, it's Shay. Leave a message.

01:03:58.672 --> 01:04:00.590
That lady.

01:04:02.509 --> 01:04:04.594
You see her, too?

01:04:05.637 --> 01:04:07.097
Every night.

01:04:07.806 --> 01:04:08.932
Every night?

01:04:08.973 --> 01:04:10.809
She always does the same thing.

01:04:10.892 --> 01:04:12.644
It's a loop.

01:04:14.479 --> 01:04:17.399
She's worse.

01:04:17.482 --> 01:04:18.650
What?

01:04:18.733 --> 01:04:20.485
Since you got here.

01:04:20.527 --> 01:04:23.446
Sh-She's angry.

01:04:33.665 --> 01:04:34.833
Shay?

01:04:34.916 --> 01:04:37.085
What the fuck?

01:04:48.263 --> 01:04:50.306
Shay?

01:05:18.918 --> 01:05:20.462
Shay?

01:05:59.959 --> 01:06:01.586
Shay?

01:06:09.594 --> 01:06:10.845
Shay?

01:06:22.357 --> 01:06:23.274
Jas.

01:06:23.316 --> 01:06:24.693
-Shay!
-Jas.

01:06:26.111 --> 01:06:27.404
What the hell happened?

01:06:27.445 --> 01:06:28.863
There's a dead guy out there.

01:06:28.947 --> 01:06:31.449
It was, um... something...

01:06:31.533 --> 01:06:33.785
someone, someone in the house
that killed him.

01:06:33.827 --> 01:06:35.120
They killed him.

01:06:36.705 --> 01:06:38.998
-Shay.
-Shh.

01:06:39.916 --> 01:06:40.959
Did you hear that?

01:06:41.042 --> 01:06:43.378
Hear what?

01:06:47.007 --> 01:06:50.176
Shay, let's get out of here.

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:53.263
Jas, I can't leave.

01:06:53.304 --> 01:06:55.974
-I'm trapped.
-That's impossible!

01:06:56.016 --> 01:06:57.142
Watch.

01:06:58.893 --> 01:06:59.853
Let's go.

01:06:59.936 --> 01:07:02.397
Run. Run. We have to hide.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.524
-No. No, Shay, we're leaving.
-There's no way out, Jas!

01:07:04.607 --> 01:07:06.484
Well,
how do you think I got in?!

01:07:08.028 --> 01:07:10.030
Andrew, come on.
Andrew, we have to go.

01:07:10.113 --> 01:07:12.032
Come on. Andrew.

01:07:13.324 --> 01:07:15.577
What is going on, Shay?

01:07:19.456 --> 01:07:21.291
No.

01:07:21.332 --> 01:07:23.918
-What are you doing, Shay?
-Get away from her!

01:07:24.002 --> 01:07:25.003
Shay!

01:07:37.182 --> 01:07:38.183
I'm sorry.

01:07:38.224 --> 01:07:40.143
I'm so sorry.

01:07:40.185 --> 01:07:41.269
Shit.

01:07:41.353 --> 01:07:43.730
Jas. Jas.

01:07:43.813 --> 01:07:45.148
Jas.

01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:47.359
Jas, I'm so sorry.
I thought it was her.

01:07:48.526 --> 01:07:52.238
She was right in front of you.
I don't understand.

01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:59.662
Okay. I'm gonna lift you.

01:08:01.039 --> 01:08:02.207
We need to hurry. Come on.

01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:04.542
Let's try this together.

01:08:11.383 --> 01:08:13.093
Shay?

01:08:14.594 --> 01:08:17.055
I'll get out. Just be safe.

01:08:31.736 --> 01:08:32.779
Chase.

01:08:32.862 --> 01:08:34.489
Y-You killed that lady.

01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:38.576
No.

01:08:39.327 --> 01:08:41.371
No, Chase, listen.

01:08:41.413 --> 01:08:43.790
There's a crazy person
in this house, okay?

01:08:43.873 --> 01:08:45.166
Yeah, you.

01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:47.544
I know you're scared.

01:08:47.585 --> 01:08:48.920
So am I.

01:08:49.879 --> 01:08:51.423
Okay?

01:08:51.506 --> 01:08:53.425
But I have to keep you safe.

01:08:53.508 --> 01:08:56.261
So you have to trust me.

01:08:57.053 --> 01:08:58.972
No! Chase!

01:10:16.383 --> 01:10:17.342
Abigail.

01:10:17.384 --> 01:10:19.761
I know this place.

01:10:27.185 --> 01:10:28.978
Where's Blair?

01:10:33.733 --> 01:10:34.901
Stay back.

01:10:36.861 --> 01:10:38.488
Kate.

01:10:38.571 --> 01:10:41.408
Look, I-I've been trying to call
you, and it's not going through.

01:10:41.491 --> 01:10:42.701
-I got worried.
-Kate.

01:10:42.784 --> 01:10:44.160
-I'm coming home.
-Kate, listen to me.

01:10:44.202 --> 01:10:45.495
-There's a crazy woman.
-What?

01:10:45.537 --> 01:10:47.205
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:10:47.247 --> 01:10:48.415
Shay?

01:10:48.498 --> 01:10:50.333
A-Are my kids all right?

01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:52.293
The kids, th-they're...

01:10:52.377 --> 01:10:54.629
Shay, talk to me.

01:10:55.422 --> 01:10:56.673
Andrew's fine.

01:10:56.715 --> 01:10:57.966
Um...

01:10:58.049 --> 01:11:00.260
Chase is... he's scared.

01:11:00.343 --> 01:11:02.137
He thinks...

01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:03.596
that I would've done this.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.807
And I don't know where Blair...

01:11:05.890 --> 01:11:06.933
Shay?

01:11:07.017 --> 01:11:08.518
-I don't know where Blair is.
-What?

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.894
I tried to protect her, but...

01:11:09.936 --> 01:11:11.688
Shay, you're not
making any sense.

01:11:11.730 --> 01:11:13.064
I'm so sorry.

01:11:13.148 --> 01:11:15.900
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:11:15.942 --> 01:11:17.402
Blair's missing.

01:11:17.444 --> 01:11:18.611
Shay, stop.

01:11:18.695 --> 01:11:21.406
Your daughter is missing.

01:11:21.448 --> 01:11:23.992
I don't have a daughter.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.261
Wh-What is she doing?

01:11:43.303 --> 01:11:45.513
Get away. Get away.

01:11:45.597 --> 01:11:47.724
She sees things.

01:11:47.766 --> 01:11:48.933
So can I.

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.856
Mommy wants to hurt you.

01:11:57.275 --> 01:11:59.319
We have to hide.

01:11:59.402 --> 01:12:00.945
Get away.

01:12:01.821 --> 01:12:03.907
- Get away.
- You're crazy.

01:12:03.948 --> 01:12:05.450
Just like Andrew!

01:12:06.409 --> 01:12:09.996
Chase, Chase, it's not safe. No.

01:12:13.458 --> 01:12:15.627
She only wants you.

01:12:15.710 --> 01:12:18.046
But they'll try
to come for you first.

01:12:18.129 --> 01:12:20.131
-Who?
-Everyone.

01:12:20.215 --> 01:12:21.758
The slaves.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:25.345
You have to hide
until they come.

01:12:53.998 --> 01:12:55.000
Come in.

01:12:55.041 --> 01:12:56.376
You must keep quiet.

01:12:56.459 --> 01:12:58.670
<i>You're not allowed</i>
<i>in here anymore.</i>

01:13:07.887 --> 01:13:08.972
I'm her.

01:13:09.014 --> 01:13:10.640
Abigail.

01:13:11.516 --> 01:13:13.476
You came back for me.

01:13:16.604 --> 01:13:18.773
You are my best friend.

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:21.359
Remember.

01:13:23.737 --> 01:13:25.238
- Abigail.
- Blair.

01:13:25.321 --> 01:13:28.199
They're coming
to rescue you, all of you.

01:13:28.241 --> 01:13:29.993
We have to go. Now.

01:13:32.037 --> 01:13:33.955
That night...

01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:43.048
Sh-She's the evil
that's keeping us here.

01:13:43.089 --> 01:13:45.467
Stay back! Get out!

01:13:46.801 --> 01:13:49.095
What did you do?!

01:13:51.348 --> 01:13:53.475
The spiritual loop.

01:13:53.558 --> 01:13:56.186
<i>We have to hide Abigail.</i>

01:13:56.227 --> 01:13:57.979
No.

01:13:59.356 --> 01:14:00.899
Hiding won't work.

01:14:04.694 --> 01:14:06.738
We have to break the cycle.

01:14:06.821 --> 01:14:09.532
Or else this'll keep happening.

01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:18.249
We have to leave together
this time.

01:14:22.295 --> 01:14:24.547
You can't have her!

01:14:24.589 --> 01:14:26.591
-Mommy, no!
-Come on, let's go!

01:14:30.512 --> 01:14:31.888
Blair, come on. Come on.

01:14:43.733 --> 01:14:45.944
Don't leave me again.

01:14:45.985 --> 01:14:48.154
Blair!

01:14:49.406 --> 01:14:51.116
No, don't let them in!

01:14:53.326 --> 01:14:55.036
Take my hands.

01:14:56.579 --> 01:14:58.039
Don't look away.

01:15:00.959 --> 01:15:02.585
Blair!

01:15:10.427 --> 01:15:12.220
Don't let them in!

01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:23.815
<i>Abigail.</i>

01:15:33.033 --> 01:15:34.701
What did you do?!

01:15:40.331 --> 01:15:42.542
What did you do?

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.774
Chase! Come on, help!

01:16:12.238 --> 01:16:13.865
Blair.

01:16:13.948 --> 01:16:16.576
<i>Don't look away.</i>

01:16:18.787 --> 01:16:20.663
Shay! Watch out!

01:16:29.255 --> 01:16:30.632
Shay.

01:16:33.385 --> 01:16:34.386
Shay.

01:16:42.602 --> 01:16:44.688
-I got her. I got her.
-Come here!

01:16:44.729 --> 01:16:47.399
-I got her.
-It's your turn now!

01:16:50.735 --> 01:16:53.697
You can't hold on to us anymore.

01:16:53.738 --> 01:16:55.073
Go to hell.

01:17:21.016 --> 01:17:22.976
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:17:23.059 --> 01:17:25.520
It hurts, but I'll be okay.

01:17:25.603 --> 01:17:27.022
I'm sorry.

01:17:30.608 --> 01:17:35.572
I think I'm done doing
this never-ending cycle thing.

01:17:35.613 --> 01:17:38.033
After seeing that shit...

01:17:40.285 --> 01:17:42.454
...I'd be done, too.

01:17:44.414 --> 01:17:46.124
Atlanta?

01:17:47.751 --> 01:17:49.627
Might as well.

01:18:47.852 --> 01:18:49.646
- Boys!
- Mom!

01:18:49.688 --> 01:18:51.314
Mom!

01:19:00.532 --> 01:19:01.741
Boys.
