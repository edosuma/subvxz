00:00.414 --> 00:02.644
Previously on Young Sheldon...

00:02.644 --> 00:04.254
Sounds like I'm done here.

00:04.254 --> 00:06.673
It's probably that coach
from Carthage. Actually,

00:06.673 --> 00:08.717
I got offered the job. Wayne.

00:08.717 --> 00:10.010
Morning, George.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.511
I quit.
Come on.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.555
Is there a chance I keep my job?

00:13.555 --> 00:14.931
No.

00:14.931 --> 00:17.017
Then at least let me leave
on my own terms.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.393
All right.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.317
All right, almost there.

00:25.317 --> 00:27.235
I don't know about this.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.988
The last surprise you got me
is pressing on my bladder.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.658
Surprise.

00:33.658 --> 00:35.327
You got me an ugly car?

00:35.327 --> 00:38.246
No, I bought me
a family car.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.581
What about your Mustang?

00:39.581 --> 00:40.874
I traded it in.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.125
For this?

00:42.125 --> 00:44.336
That's what the guy
at the lot said.

00:44.336 --> 00:46.671
But you love that Mustang.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.131
Yeah, but there was no way

00:48.131 --> 00:49.257
I was gonna get a
baby seat in the back.

00:49.257 --> 00:51.468
Well, that's very thoughtful.

00:51.468 --> 00:54.304
And these things are real
safe, too. My mom has one.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.181
When I was little, she hit
an ice cream truck with it.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.891
I didn't even wake up.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.018
Is this a bad time to tell you

01:00.018 --> 01:02.187
I only liked you
for your cool car?

01:02.187 --> 01:03.855
You say that now,
but wait till

01:03.855 --> 01:05.440
you see how many
groceries we can get

01:05.440 --> 01:07.525
in the back of this thing.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.739
I can't believe you did this.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.324
It's a no-brainer.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.242
I want to keep our kid safe.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.328
Thank you.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.374
Hm. That was interesting.

01:22.374 --> 01:23.375
Oh, grow up.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.459
Grow up?

01:24.459 --> 01:26.211
I bought a car that seats 25.

01:27.712 --> 01:30.840
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:30.840 --> 01:33.218
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪

01:33.218 --> 01:35.637
♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪

01:35.637 --> 01:38.765
♪ I am a mighty little man ♪

01:38.765 --> 01:42.644
♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪

01:47.899 --> 01:51.069
It's so nice that you're
joining us for dinner.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.113
Please don't make
a big deal out of it.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.240
I just said it was nice.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.783
You said so nice.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.076
I'm sorry.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.577
It's fine.

01:59.577 --> 02:01.704
Niblingo,
I have a question.

02:01.704 --> 02:03.206
Niblingo?

02:03.206 --> 02:04.499
He made it up.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.209
I coined it
because there was no word

02:06.209 --> 02:07.961
to denote the unmarried mother
of our niece or nephew.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.421
Sheldon, that sounds rude.

02:09.421 --> 02:10.922
Do you have a better word for

02:10.922 --> 02:12.132
the unmarried mother
of a niece or nephew?

02:12.132 --> 02:14.008
I'm not sure we need one.

02:14.008 --> 02:15.510
I think it's sweet.

02:15.510 --> 02:16.636
Kind of.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.471
Uh, what's your question?

02:18.471 --> 02:19.764
Thanks, Niblingo.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.182
I've heard that
pregnant women

02:21.182 --> 02:22.600
eat for two.
Does that mean

02:22.600 --> 02:24.477
that you need two
full-size portions?

02:24.477 --> 02:26.271
I guess Dad's pregnant then.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.772
One portion should be fine,

02:27.772 --> 02:29.774
considering the baby's
the size of a golf ball.

02:29.774 --> 02:31.359
Actually, according
to my calculations,

02:31.359 --> 02:33.236
the baby's the size
of a bell pepper.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.487
Although I could be off.

02:34.487 --> 02:35.780
When was your
last menstruation?

02:35.780 --> 02:37.157
You do not need to answer that.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.200
I was not going to.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.660
I'm real sorry about them.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.620
Wh...
I didn't say anything wrong.

02:42.620 --> 02:43.830
Neither did I.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.248
You were being overly nice.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.083
It made everybody uncomfortable.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.130
Who's calling during dinner?

02:53.298 --> 02:55.383
You know, twins
run in our family.

02:55.383 --> 02:56.634
It's not twins.

02:56.634 --> 02:58.344
That's too bad.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.180
It would double your chances
of having a remarkable child.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.222
Like me.

03:01.222 --> 03:02.307
Or a child that people like.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.391
Just eat your dinner.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.020
Are you gonna find out the sex?

03:07.020 --> 03:08.354
Yes.
No.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.731
No?

03:09.731 --> 03:11.274
I want to be surprised.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.652
I don't like surprises.

03:14.652 --> 03:17.030
What about the baby shower?
People are gonna want to know.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.324
Oh, yeah.
We got to have a baby shower.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.493
Remind me what a baby shower is.

03:21.493 --> 03:22.994
I got to go.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.329
Everything okay?

03:24.329 --> 03:25.830
That was Petersen.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.207
Something's going on with Wayne.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.833
What's that mean?
I don't know.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.335
Doesn't sound good.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.506
Did you know the
modern baby shower

03:34.506 --> 03:36.508
has history that goes
back to ancient Egyptian

03:36.508 --> 03:37.759
and Greek civilizations?

03:39.886 --> 03:41.596
Remarkable.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.809
What's going on?

03:46.809 --> 03:48.061
I don't know.
He didn't show up for work.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.229
I heard he was here.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.147
What's that about?
I don't know.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.858
Go away.

03:53.858 --> 03:56.736
Wayne, it's George.
Open up.

03:56.736 --> 03:59.322
I said go away.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.741
If you don't let us in...

04:01.741 --> 04:03.701
Tom here says he's gonna
knock the door down.

04:03.701 --> 04:04.953
Why you got to...

04:10.959 --> 04:13.127
Want a drink?

04:13.127 --> 04:14.837
I got vodka
and root beer.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.130
Ugh.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.801
Wayne, what's going on?

04:20.760 --> 04:22.178
My life is a lie.

04:22.178 --> 04:23.263
Gay?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.430
I don't know.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.306
We're gonna need
more than that.

04:25.306 --> 04:26.891
My marriage.

04:26.891 --> 04:29.769
My beautiful marriage--
it's-it's over.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.354
You and Darlene? No.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.314
You two are the happiest
couple I know.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.358
I mean, wh...
whatever's going on,

04:35.358 --> 04:36.484
it'll blow over.

04:36.484 --> 04:37.986
She's cheating on me.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.404
You sure?

04:39.404 --> 04:42.615
Oh, man. I'm sorry,
that's terrible.

04:42.615 --> 04:43.992
With my best friend.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.703
That's even more terrible.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.246
She was my world.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.872
Well there's no reason
to throw in the towel.

04:49.872 --> 04:51.624
I mean, you can
still get her back.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.919
She's having his baby.

04:54.919 --> 04:57.255
Well... Say something.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.756
What do you say to that?

04:58.756 --> 05:01.342
You really never
suspected anything?

05:01.342 --> 05:04.053
That's what you say?
You had nothing.

05:04.053 --> 05:06.180
Wayne, buddy, uh...

05:06.180 --> 05:07.765
Uh...

05:07.765 --> 05:10.143
No, I-I know it seems bad now,

05:10.143 --> 05:11.477
which it is.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.396
Which is why it seems that way.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.481
Oh, my God.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.358
Just... Just
leave me alone.

05:17.358 --> 05:19.427
Y'all can't fix this.

05:25.331 --> 05:26.666
What do you want to do?

05:26.666 --> 05:29.460
Oh, I don't know.
We can't leave him here.

05:29.460 --> 05:30.545
Let's take him
to your place.

05:30.545 --> 05:32.213
I can't do that.
Why not?

05:32.213 --> 05:33.923
If I took in every teacher
with marital problems,

05:33.923 --> 05:36.717
my apartment would
look like a firehouse.

05:36.717 --> 05:38.719
Fine.

05:39.679 --> 05:42.723
Wayne, grab your pants.
You're coming with me.

05:42.723 --> 05:45.726
I don't want to be around you
and your happy family.

05:45.726 --> 05:48.437
Happy?
Uh, couple days with us

05:48.437 --> 05:49.730
and you'll be glad that kid

05:49.730 --> 05:51.065
ain't yours.

05:51.065 --> 05:52.733
Let's go. Pants.

05:54.318 --> 05:56.070
Well, thanks again.
That was fun.

05:56.070 --> 05:58.531
Really?
Dinner with my family?

05:58.531 --> 06:00.199
My family
won't talk to me at all.

06:00.199 --> 06:03.744
So, I'll take "niblingo"
and a home-cooked meal any day.

06:03.744 --> 06:06.080
Well, you're
always welcome.

06:07.999 --> 06:10.585
I think there's
ice cream in the freezer,

06:10.585 --> 06:12.003
if you want to come in.

06:12.003 --> 06:14.005
I mean, I'm gonna eat it,
but you can watch.

06:14.005 --> 06:16.424
Thanks, but I got
to get to work.

06:16.424 --> 06:17.925
It's a laundromat.

06:17.925 --> 06:19.635
Doesn't it kind of
run on its own?

06:22.889 --> 06:24.432
You'd think that,

06:24.432 --> 06:26.726
but there's a lot
of technical issues--

06:26.726 --> 06:28.227
lint and such.

06:28.227 --> 06:31.189
Okay. Good night.

06:31.189 --> 06:33.065
Good night.

06:37.278 --> 06:38.362
Look at me.

06:38.362 --> 06:40.323
Just chipping away at the ice.

06:47.163 --> 06:49.123
Well, this is a wrinkle.

06:52.084 --> 06:55.254
Missy. Missy.

06:55.254 --> 06:56.714
What?

06:56.714 --> 06:58.216
An issue of social protocol
has arisen,

06:58.216 --> 06:59.800
and I need your input.

07:01.719 --> 07:02.929
What's he doing here?

07:02.929 --> 07:04.680
I don't know.

07:04.680 --> 07:07.558
But more importantly, would it
be rude if I watch television?

07:10.353 --> 07:11.312
Mom.

07:11.312 --> 07:12.605
What?

07:12.605 --> 07:14.398
Why is Coach Wilkins
asleep on the couch?

07:14.398 --> 07:16.692
No, the question is
can I watch TV

07:16.692 --> 07:18.486
with Coach Wilkins
asleep on the couch?

07:18.486 --> 07:20.071
It's a subtle but
important difference.

07:20.071 --> 07:21.864
Get out.

07:28.257 --> 07:29.425
Oh, hey, Tom.

07:29.425 --> 07:30.676
How's he doing?

07:30.676 --> 07:33.220
Still sleeping it off.
Mm-hmm.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.306
Morning, Tom. Mary.

07:35.306 --> 07:38.392
I just can't believe
Darlene would do that to him.

07:38.392 --> 07:40.061
Yeah, just...

07:40.061 --> 07:42.354
Right before the big game
Friday night.

07:42.354 --> 07:44.607
Think he can
pull himself together by then?

07:44.607 --> 07:45.775
How would I know?

07:45.775 --> 07:46.817
Really?

07:46.817 --> 07:48.069
A man's life is coming apart

07:48.069 --> 07:49.278
and you're worried about
a football game?

07:49.278 --> 07:51.030
Well, yeah.

07:51.989 --> 07:53.866
Can we take this outside?

07:58.162 --> 07:59.705
Do you mind?

07:59.705 --> 08:00.915
I don't mind.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.708
Do you mind?
I don't mind.

08:02.708 --> 08:04.376
We don't mind.

08:05.878 --> 08:09.256
Oh, listen, George,
I really need your help here.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.133
What do you
expect me to do?

08:11.133 --> 08:13.094
I don't know.
Get him coaching again.

08:13.094 --> 08:15.679
You gave him my job.
This is your problem.

08:15.679 --> 08:17.640
Well, you quit.
You were gonna fire me.

08:17.640 --> 08:18.766
But you quit first.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.684
Can we please
just focus on Wayne?

08:20.684 --> 08:21.894
I'm begging you, George.

08:21.894 --> 08:24.563
You know what a big deal
this game is.

08:25.523 --> 08:27.608
Don't know what the hell
I'm supposed to do.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.860
Okay.

08:29.860 --> 08:31.612
Thank you.
I owe you one.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.322
I'm not doing this for you,

08:33.322 --> 08:34.824
I'm doing it
for the kids on that team.

08:34.824 --> 08:37.034
What about Wayne?
What about him?

08:38.035 --> 08:39.328
And Wayne.

08:43.916 --> 08:46.335
I had Georgie go get
your car from the motel.

08:46.335 --> 08:48.045
Thanks.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.424
Trust me, going back to work
is just what you need.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.059
One thing you
got to remember,

09:02.059 --> 09:04.353
this story ain't over.

09:04.353 --> 09:06.355
We don't know how
it's gonna end.

09:06.355 --> 09:08.524
The only person that
can decide that is you.

09:08.524 --> 09:11.652
You are the hero of your story.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.988
You take the action.
You call the shots.

09:13.988 --> 09:16.031
You decide your destiny.

09:16.949 --> 09:19.034
That's the same speech
you gave at halftime

09:19.034 --> 09:21.620
when we were getting our nuts
crushed by Nacogdoches.

09:21.620 --> 09:24.165
And you remember what happened?
We came back and won that game.

09:24.165 --> 09:26.750
After their quarterback
dislocated his shoulder.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.586
You're not even
trying, Wayne.

09:30.379 --> 09:32.256
I am, you're not.

09:37.511 --> 09:39.180
Ms. McAllister,

09:39.180 --> 09:41.140
we don't have any insurance
information on file for you.

09:41.140 --> 09:43.809
Oh, that's all right.
We'll be paying in cash.

09:43.809 --> 09:44.810
Cash?

09:44.810 --> 09:46.604
In God we trust.

09:50.774 --> 09:52.735
You always carry
that much cash around?

09:52.735 --> 09:55.112
Do you think there's
just boobs in this bra?

09:56.363 --> 09:57.823
No, I mean, why?

10:01.410 --> 10:04.997
Well, the laundromat's
a cash business.

10:04.997 --> 10:07.208
That's mostly just quarters,
though, isn't it?

10:07.208 --> 10:11.212
Uh, yeah, but, well, now
we've got the video store,

10:11.212 --> 10:13.631
and I'm not real
big on banks.

10:13.631 --> 10:16.008
Because you lived through
the Depression?

10:17.676 --> 10:19.011
Yeah.

10:21.013 --> 10:23.599
All right, everyone.
Pencils out, books away.

10:23.599 --> 10:25.643
Let's get ready
to take this test.

10:25.643 --> 10:26.852
Mrs. Wilkins?

10:28.395 --> 10:30.231
Are you sure you want us
to take this test today?

10:30.231 --> 10:31.565
Why wouldn't I?

10:31.565 --> 10:33.025
Well, you know,

10:33.025 --> 10:34.652
with everything
you're going through?

10:36.487 --> 10:38.948
Okay, we got your playbook,

10:38.948 --> 10:40.950
we got your practice plan, and

10:40.950 --> 10:44.036
you, sir, are ready to coach
some kick-ass football.

10:45.496 --> 10:47.081
Thanks, George.

10:47.081 --> 10:48.165
I really appreciate

10:48.165 --> 10:49.959
everything you've done for me.

10:49.959 --> 10:52.920
Coming back to work
was just what I needed.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.256
Happy to help.

10:55.256 --> 10:57.383
Coach Wilkins.

10:57.383 --> 10:59.885
What the hell did you
tell Missy Cooper?!

11:01.804 --> 11:03.347
I'll give you some privacy.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.768
Over in this aisle we've
got your new releases.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.645
Here are your action
and adventures--

11:09.645 --> 11:11.105
your Stallones,
your Schwarzeneggers,

11:11.105 --> 11:12.773
your Van Dammes,

11:12.773 --> 11:15.442
and of course we have a
whole row of chick flicks,

11:15.442 --> 11:18.404
known in the movie
biz as rom-coms.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.656
Do not enter?

11:20.656 --> 11:23.200
What's back there?
Oh, that? That's just

11:23.200 --> 11:25.452
some storage and
a bunch of machines

11:25.452 --> 11:27.913
that rewind the tapes
when people are not kind

11:27.913 --> 11:29.081
and don't rewind.

11:29.081 --> 11:30.332
Very cool.

11:31.083 --> 11:33.794
Hey, if you ever need any help
behind the cash register,

11:33.794 --> 11:35.671
I'd sure rather
be working here than being

11:35.671 --> 11:37.965
on my feet all day at the diner.
Mm, no.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.675
No, you don't want to do that.

11:39.675 --> 11:41.093
You're such a good waitress.

11:41.093 --> 11:42.511
It'd be a waste of your talent.

11:43.345 --> 11:44.847
Hey, Georgie.

11:44.847 --> 11:46.890
Officer Rutledge.

11:46.890 --> 11:50.394
Congratulations on your
expanding business empire.

11:50.394 --> 11:52.479
Thank you. Very kind.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.856
Hey there, Jake.

11:53.856 --> 11:55.149
Hey, Connie.

11:55.149 --> 11:56.900
I was just telling
your grandson here

11:56.900 --> 11:59.236
how much I love the new place.

12:00.404 --> 12:03.115
Mandy, let me show you
the kids section.

12:05.826 --> 12:09.204
Got all the Looney Tunes,
Flintstones, Fraggle Rock.

12:10.706 --> 12:12.666
What's going on?

12:12.666 --> 12:15.419
Nothing. Just figured
we're having a kid,

12:15.419 --> 12:17.212
we should be familiar
with the genre.

12:17.212 --> 12:19.840
Well, thanks for dropping by.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.843
We need to renegotiate
our arrangement.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.261
Uh, and we will
talk about that soon.

12:24.261 --> 12:26.305
Meanwhile...

12:26.305 --> 12:28.724
Grab some Red Vines.
Show of good faith.

12:33.687 --> 12:35.606
You wouldn't
think it about Jake, but...

12:35.606 --> 12:38.525
he just loves a foreign film.

12:38.525 --> 12:39.902
Just stop it, okay?

12:39.902 --> 12:41.904
I know what's going on here.
You do?

12:41.904 --> 12:44.531
That creepy cop,
that trip to Mexico,

12:44.531 --> 12:46.158
all that cash in your bra.

12:46.158 --> 12:47.576
Y'all are selling drugs.

12:47.576 --> 12:50.037
We're not
selling drugs.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.413
So you're telling me
there's nothing weird

12:51.413 --> 12:52.414
going on back there?

12:52.414 --> 12:54.792
Oh, I didn't say that.

13:00.340 --> 13:02.216
Let's take a walk.

13:02.216 --> 13:04.969
Try and keep an open mind.

13:11.517 --> 13:12.977
Oh, my God.

13:12.977 --> 13:14.771
See? Not drugs.

13:14.771 --> 13:17.065
And that is the sound

13:17.065 --> 13:20.109
of a 22% house advantage.

13:21.194 --> 13:22.236
Is it legal?

13:22.236 --> 13:23.863
Yes.
No.

13:23.863 --> 13:26.115
Kind of.
K... Kind of.

13:26.115 --> 13:27.408
So, the police are in on it.

13:27.408 --> 13:28.743
A little bit, yeah.

13:28.743 --> 13:31.162
Silent partner, as they say.

13:32.163 --> 13:33.539
I know it's a lot.

13:36.125 --> 13:37.460
It's amazing.

13:37.460 --> 13:38.878
It is?

13:38.878 --> 13:41.714
My kid's going to
private school.

13:41.714 --> 13:43.341
You're going to
private school!

13:46.260 --> 13:49.055
All right, everybody.
Great practice.

13:49.055 --> 13:51.015
Let's gather round, take a knee.

13:54.102 --> 13:56.104
All right, Coach.
They're all yours.

13:56.104 --> 13:58.356
Thank you, George.

13:58.356 --> 14:00.108
Look at you guys.

14:00.108 --> 14:02.276
Young, strong,

14:02.276 --> 14:04.779
all your hopes and dreams
in front of you.

14:04.779 --> 14:06.364
None of you have any idea

14:06.364 --> 14:07.949
of what's out there
waiting for you.

14:07.949 --> 14:09.033
Wayne, where you
going with it?

14:09.033 --> 14:12.036
A team requires trust.

14:12.036 --> 14:13.788
Sure, you can

14:13.788 --> 14:17.041
count on your teammates
when the ball is snapped.

14:17.041 --> 14:18.376
But can you count on them

14:18.376 --> 14:20.044
when they're away
at a teachers conference

14:20.044 --> 14:22.922
with the woman you were gonna
spend your life with?

14:22.922 --> 14:24.173
Hmm?

14:25.967 --> 14:27.677
Okay.

14:28.678 --> 14:29.846
"Team" on three.

14:32.181 --> 14:34.851
I will not submit
to the procedures.

14:34.851 --> 14:36.519
That's Commander Data.

14:38.646 --> 14:40.731
He's an android,
but he aspires to be human.

14:40.731 --> 14:41.941
Which, if you ask me,

14:41.941 --> 14:43.317
is a step
in the wrong direction.

14:43.317 --> 14:44.735
I understand your objection.

14:47.488 --> 14:50.324
I don't know how he's gonna
coach the game on Friday night.

14:50.324 --> 14:51.534
Poor man.

14:51.534 --> 14:53.077
Can you believe his marriage

14:53.077 --> 14:54.954
falling apart like that?
I know.

14:54.954 --> 14:57.999
If it was gonna happen to
anybody, you'd think it'd be us.

14:57.999 --> 14:59.333
Ain't that the truth.

15:01.043 --> 15:02.420
Saw your wife today.

15:02.420 --> 15:04.130
I heard.

15:04.130 --> 15:06.966
You're smart to stay here.
She seems pretty mad.

15:12.513 --> 15:14.015
Okay, Wayne, we
got the ball back,

15:14.015 --> 15:15.349
what do you want to do?

15:15.349 --> 15:16.893
Kill myself.

15:16.893 --> 15:18.728
Come on, buddy,
help me out here.

15:18.728 --> 15:20.980
I can't, George.

15:22.607 --> 15:23.983
I just can't.

15:26.027 --> 15:27.028
Okay.

15:27.028 --> 15:29.530
All right. Stevens!

15:29.530 --> 15:31.574
Come on.
All right, listen up.

15:31.574 --> 15:33.910
Yeah.
All right, we're gonna run
the ball the rest of the game.

15:33.910 --> 15:35.369
Okay? Two hands.

15:35.369 --> 15:36.871
Nothing fancy. All right?
Yes, Coach.

15:36.871 --> 15:39.332
Let them pass,
let them turn it over.

15:39.332 --> 15:41.000
All right? Go.

15:53.095 --> 15:54.847
Hey, I brought some
pizza home, come on.

15:54.847 --> 15:55.890
Can't.

15:55.890 --> 15:57.767
Sheldon, there ain't no leaks.

15:57.767 --> 16:00.394
There might be.
I can't risk it.

16:00.394 --> 16:01.938
You want me to bring you
a slice in here?

16:01.938 --> 16:03.356
What about crumbs?

16:03.356 --> 16:05.900
Crumbs attract bugs.
Bugs bring disease.

16:05.900 --> 16:07.235
Give me the bucket.

16:07.235 --> 16:08.778
I'll watch for leaks
while you go eat.

16:08.778 --> 16:10.780
Really?
Yeah.

16:11.781 --> 16:13.074
Okay.

16:14.742 --> 16:16.869
But keep an eye above
the computer,

16:16.869 --> 16:18.621
that's the heart
of my whole operation.

16:18.621 --> 16:19.914
Got it.

16:19.914 --> 16:22.625
And the train set.
Go eat.

16:26.003 --> 16:28.297
Sheldon, where's your brother?

16:28.297 --> 16:30.383
He's in my room.
Don't distract him.

16:33.678 --> 16:35.972
Hey.
Hey.

16:35.972 --> 16:37.014
What are you doing?

16:37.014 --> 16:38.808
I'm on leak patrol.

16:38.808 --> 16:40.142
What?

16:40.142 --> 16:41.686
I'm babysitting
and it's the only way

16:41.686 --> 16:43.062
I can get my brother to eat.

16:44.522 --> 16:45.856
What's up?

16:45.856 --> 16:48.693
I just
wanted to thank you

16:48.693 --> 16:50.820
for how wonderful
you've been.

16:51.821 --> 16:54.240
Oh, good, you noticed.

16:58.035 --> 16:59.537
I noticed.

16:59.537 --> 17:01.038
Status report?

17:01.038 --> 17:02.790
Dry as a bone.

17:02.790 --> 17:04.083
So, I have time
for a second slice?

17:04.083 --> 17:05.167
Go nuts.

17:05.167 --> 17:07.128
Copy.

17:07.128 --> 17:10.673
If our kid's
weird, I'm ready.

17:11.799 --> 17:16.137
Final score, Medford 6, Tyler 0.

17:18.264 --> 17:19.348
George!

17:22.143 --> 17:23.311
Congratulations.

17:23.311 --> 17:24.812
Thanks, Tom.

17:24.812 --> 17:27.315
Feel like
doing this again next week?

17:27.315 --> 17:28.816
What are you saying?

17:28.816 --> 17:31.110
I'm saying
you got your job back.

17:31.110 --> 17:32.361
If you want it.

17:32.361 --> 17:33.946
What about Wayne?

17:38.200 --> 17:40.328
What about him?

17:40.328 --> 17:42.204
He's got to be part of the deal.

17:42.204 --> 17:44.498
Don't you have enough
to worry about?

17:44.498 --> 17:46.000
He's my friend.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.252
And if I want him
out of my house, he needs a job.

17:48.252 --> 17:49.712
Your call.

17:49.712 --> 17:51.088
Thanks, Tom.

17:51.088 --> 17:53.507
You bet.

17:53.507 --> 17:56.052
Hey! What...

17:56.052 --> 17:57.178
That's for firing me.

18:00.681 --> 18:02.224
You quit!

18:32.025 --> 18:33.360
Morning.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.154
Oh.

18:35.154 --> 18:36.780
You're up early.

18:36.780 --> 18:38.574
You were out late.

18:38.574 --> 18:40.993
Uh, yeah. I was just, uh...

18:40.993 --> 18:42.077
I know where you were.

18:42.995 --> 18:44.246
Okay.

18:45.622 --> 18:46.957
Do we need to talk about this?

18:46.957 --> 18:49.877
I'm happy to just
enjoy the awkwardness.

18:49.877 --> 18:52.254
Great. Well...

18:53.881 --> 18:55.007
I'm gonna go.

18:55.437 --> 18:57.022
And I'm gonna watch you.
