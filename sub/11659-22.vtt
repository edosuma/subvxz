00:41.433 --> 00:46.367
(calm music playing)

00:55.567 --> 00:58.000
For crying out loud.
Where is he now?

00:58.066 --> 00:59.834
He'll never finish
this remodeling job.

00:59.900 --> 01:03.667
-Dorothy, relax. He'll be back.
-The man's a thief.

01:03.734 --> 01:05.467
I haven't seen a crime like this
in a garage

01:05.533 --> 01:08.934
since the St. Valentine's day
massacre.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.533
Ma, you did not see
the St. Valentine's day massacre.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.900
Right. I was in the movies
that day, all day.

01:18.667 --> 01:20.800
Hi, ladies.
Looks nice, doesn't it?

01:20.867 --> 01:25.500
No, Ernie. It looks exactly
as it did last week.

01:25.567 --> 01:28.600
When will this garage
look like a guest room?

01:28.667 --> 01:30.700
I don't know.
I meant my new suit.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.266
Ernie, this is serious.

01:34.333 --> 01:36.066
We have family
coming in a few weeks,

01:36.133 --> 01:37.967
and you promised us
it would be finished.

01:38.033 --> 01:41.834
Mrs. Devereaux,
do you want it fast or good?

01:41.900 --> 01:43.133
Before you answer that,

01:43.200 --> 01:45.100
the man's talking
about a guest room.

01:50.934 --> 01:55.166
If we don't start seeing results,
you're out of here!

01:55.233 --> 01:57.500
It's hard to find a good contractor.

01:57.567 --> 01:59.700
Yes. You're living proof.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.233
Ernie, she didn't mean that.

02:04.300 --> 02:09.166
She just got up on the wrong side
of a cold, lonely, empty bed.

02:09.233 --> 02:12.000
That good-looking lady sleeps
alone? I'm shocked.

02:12.066 --> 02:14.700
You're letting a man with taste like
that remodel our garage?

02:21.166 --> 02:23.266
He's got us over a barrel.

02:23.333 --> 02:26.100
I remember the last time
a man had me over a barrel.

02:32.567 --> 02:35.000
I was at a keg party at the marina--

02:35.066 --> 02:37.133
Blanche, we have a guest.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.433
Girls, pour yourself some champagne.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.100
We're celebrating Al's retirement.

02:41.166 --> 02:43.533
You finally went through with it.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.934
I finally called it
quits at the deli.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.033
Sold it all, lox, stock, and barrel.

02:49.100 --> 02:51.333
Get it? Lox.

02:53.300 --> 02:58.500
He made up that joke yesterday,
but it's just as funny now.

02:58.567 --> 03:00.834
Some jokes are timeless.

03:01.834 --> 03:05.600
Tell me, what do you intend
doing with your retirement?

03:05.667 --> 03:08.233
Monday I'm going to sleep late.

03:08.300 --> 03:10.467
-What's after Monday?
-Tuesday.

03:13.266 --> 03:15.700
Basically I'm ready for anything.

03:15.767 --> 03:19.400
Today is the first day
of the second half of my life.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.867
Ooh, I got to run.

03:21.934 --> 03:23.300
I'll see you tonight.

03:24.934 --> 03:25.600
Bye, all.

03:25.667 --> 03:27.000
-Bye, Al.
-Bye, Al.

03:29.367 --> 03:30.367
Bye.

03:31.934 --> 03:34.100
Oh, girls, I'm so excited.

03:34.166 --> 03:37.000
Now that Al's retired,
we'll have so much time together.

03:37.066 --> 03:39.133
He's special to you,
isn't he?

03:39.200 --> 03:41.834
He's more than special.

03:41.900 --> 03:43.333
I think I'm falling for him.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.033
But then, who wouldn't?

03:45.100 --> 03:48.233
He's sensitive, he's caring,

03:48.300 --> 03:51.066
and he thinks I'm neater
than hard salami.

03:57.233 --> 03:59.667
Did he actually tell you that, Rose?

04:00.934 --> 04:02.633
I shouldn't have repeated it.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.600
It was said in a moment of passion.

04:06.033 --> 04:08.533
Ok. See you <i>mañana,</i> ladies.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.333
You've only been here 10 minutes.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.633
So? I'll be back tomorrow.

04:12.700 --> 04:16.767
Ernie, listen to me,
and listen good.

04:16.834 --> 04:18.567
If you walk out that door right now,

04:18.633 --> 04:20.934
you can forget about
ever coming back.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.100
I sound like I'm on <i>Ryan's Hope.</i>

04:26.033 --> 04:27.700
Fine. See you.

04:28.934 --> 04:31.000
What will we do now?

04:31.066 --> 04:33.433
This is such a mess.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.266
Seems we have two choices,

04:35.333 --> 04:39.467
1, beg Ernie's forgiveness, or
2, we can find another contractor.

04:39.533 --> 04:42.967
Or 3, the Sicilian method,
torch the garage, collect insurance,

04:43.033 --> 04:45.767
build a summer house
with an ocean view.

04:47.834 --> 04:50.567
Personally, I like number 3.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.433
I'm sorry but that's more

04:59.500 --> 05:02.033
than we're willing to spend
for a guest room.

05:02.100 --> 05:05.300
Yes, I do know the expression,
"you get what you paid for."

05:05.367 --> 05:10.333
I also know the expression, "there's
a sucker born every minute."

05:10.400 --> 05:14.467
Oh, yes.
I do know that expression too.

05:20.633 --> 05:22.867
Dorothy, that was the
last contractor in the book.

05:22.934 --> 05:26.333
I just don't care. I am so fed up
with all of these people.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.533
I'm just ready to give up.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.433
Dorothy, you can't give up.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.900
You're no quitter.

05:30.967 --> 05:34.367
Why, just think of the many times
you have been dumped by a man.

05:38.100 --> 05:40.300
Did you quit dating?
No, ma'am.

05:40.367 --> 05:43.333
You sank even lower,
scraping the bottom of the barrel,

05:43.400 --> 05:45.767
facing certain humiliation.
And why?

05:45.834 --> 05:48.500
Okay, thanks, Blanche,
I get the point.

05:48.567 --> 05:50.500
No, I mean it, Dorothy, why?

05:52.934 --> 05:54.800
-Hi, Rose.
-Hi.

05:54.867 --> 05:56.133
Honey, what's wrong?

05:56.200 --> 05:58.233
I spent the afternoon with Al.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.000
-Well, what happened?
-Nothing.

06:00.066 --> 06:03.266
Lately, all he wants to do
is watch television.

06:03.333 --> 06:06.166
That happens
with people when they retire.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.100
Maybe you should talk to him.

06:08.166 --> 06:09.734
Maybe you're right.

06:09.800 --> 06:13.133
I found the perfect guy
to convert the garage.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.800
-Follow me.
-Ooh!

06:19.300 --> 06:21.266
Everybody, this is Vincenzo.

06:21.333 --> 06:24.700
Ma, who is Vincenzo?

06:24.767 --> 06:26.233
Who he is doesn't matter.

06:26.300 --> 06:27.400
It's who he used to be.

06:27.467 --> 06:32.133
30 years ago, this man was one
of Italy's foremost architects,

06:32.200 --> 06:33.967
respected the world over,

06:34.033 --> 06:37.600
creator of some of Europe's
most beautiful cathedrals.

06:37.667 --> 06:40.433
Isn't that right, Vincenzo?

06:41.734 --> 06:43.900
Today he's a pathetic shell of a man

06:43.967 --> 06:46.433
who spends all day trying
to look up women's dresses.

06:49.567 --> 06:52.300
Relax. He doesn't speak
a word of English. Watch.

06:53.300 --> 06:56.567
Vincenzo, you're a wrinkled
old pervert, right?

07:02.500 --> 07:05.567
Sophia, Vincenzo can't do all
this work by himself.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.166
He can't do any work.

07:07.233 --> 07:09.834
He'll tell me what to do in Italian.

07:09.900 --> 07:12.333
I'll tell you. You'll work.

07:12.834 --> 07:15.467
Ma, forget it.
We're not carpenters.

07:15.533 --> 07:17.467
It's worth a try.

07:17.533 --> 07:19.333
After all, the job's
already half done.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.066
So, do we got a deal?

07:22.133 --> 07:24.433
Wait. What will he charge us?

07:24.500 --> 07:25.867
I'll ask him.

07:25.934 --> 07:28.467
(speaking Italian)

07:28.533 --> 07:31.233
(speaking Italian)

07:31.300 --> 07:35.100
(speaking Italian)

07:35.166 --> 07:39.700
(speaking Italian)

07:41.066 --> 07:42.266
He'll do it for nothing.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.033
He likes getting away
from the center.

07:44.100 --> 07:45.433
He also likes working

07:45.500 --> 07:49.033
and being in the company
of pretty young girls.

07:49.100 --> 07:54.967
Oh, well, since he puts it that way,
how can we refuse?

07:55.033 --> 07:56.100
It's a deal.

07:56.166 --> 07:57.233
Good.

07:57.300 --> 07:59.800
Here's a list of pretty young girls
he wants you to get.

08:05.667 --> 08:09.934
(serene music playing)

08:10.000 --> 08:12.767
(doorbell rings)

08:17.133 --> 08:20.266
-Hi, Al.
-Rose, you look beautiful.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.233
Oh, thank you.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.600
I know we're just
going to the movies

08:23.667 --> 08:25.367
but I felt like dressing up.

08:25.433 --> 08:28.967
Oh, it's about the movies,
would you mind if we didn't go?

08:29.033 --> 08:31.300
Well, no.
What do you feel like doing?

08:31.367 --> 08:33.367
Why don't we just do
what we did last night?

08:33.433 --> 08:34.767
We didn't do anything.

08:34.834 --> 08:36.166
Sounds good to me.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.533
Al, we have to talk.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.166
Can't it wait
till after moonlighting?

08:42.233 --> 08:44.433
There's a special episode
on tonight.

08:44.500 --> 08:47.066
It's only been rerun three times.

08:47.133 --> 08:50.467
Al, what has gotten
into you lately?

08:50.533 --> 08:53.333
Before you retired you were
the most active man I ever knew.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.467
I had to run to keep up with you.

08:55.533 --> 08:57.433
Now you're nothing
but a couch potato.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.333
You should do more, Al,
you've earned it.

09:01.400 --> 09:04.300
Isn't there one thing you've always
dreamed of doing?

09:04.367 --> 09:06.033
I always dreamed of retiring.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.767
I just don't want
you to wake up one day

09:09.834 --> 09:12.000
and think that you've missed
the opportunity

09:12.066 --> 09:13.967
to do something really great.

09:14.033 --> 09:17.567
Rose, it sounds like you're,
maybe just bored with me.

09:17.633 --> 09:19.867
Look, let's take a rain check
on tonight, okay?

09:19.934 --> 09:21.834
I'm feeling kind of tired anyway.

09:23.133 --> 09:25.600
-Call you tomorrow.
-Al...

09:26.734 --> 09:27.867
Al?

09:32.934 --> 09:34.000
Damn.

09:37.033 --> 09:41.934
(serene music playing)

09:46.567 --> 09:49.800
-(speaking Italian)
-Before we begin.

09:49.867 --> 09:51.367
(speaking Italian)

09:51.433 --> 09:52.934
Let's make one thing clear.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.200
-(speaking Italian)
-I am in charge.

09:57.266 --> 09:59.200
-(speaking Italian)
-I am the boss.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.600
-(speaking Italian)
-I am the master.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.367
-(speaking Italian)
-I am the walrus.

10:08.667 --> 10:12.734
Ma, either your Italian is rusty,
or he's the world's oldest hippie.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.934
Can't we just get started, please?

10:16.000 --> 10:20.033
(speaking Italian)

10:20.100 --> 10:22.200
First we must inspect the workers.

10:27.133 --> 10:28.467
Ow!

10:31.600 --> 10:32.900
He pinched me.

10:32.967 --> 10:34.867
It's a reflex. He's Italian.

10:36.233 --> 10:39.100
(speaking Italian)

10:39.166 --> 10:40.633
We'll start
with the simplest of jobs.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.567
(speaking Italian)

10:42.633 --> 10:43.667
Installing the window.

10:43.734 --> 10:47.133
(speaking Italian)

10:47.200 --> 10:49.233
Dorothy,
you'll hold the window in place.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.266
(speaking Italian)

10:51.333 --> 10:53.000
Rose will hammer.

10:53.066 --> 10:54.600
(speaking Italian)

10:54.667 --> 10:55.967
Blanche, you'll do the screwing.

10:56.033 --> 10:58.667
He came up with that on his own.

11:04.433 --> 11:10.066
(speaking Italian)

11:11.667 --> 11:14.867
Drill a toggle bolt,
anchor with a 5/16th bit,

11:14.934 --> 11:17.200
and miter cut
the quarter-inch plywood

11:17.266 --> 11:19.333
after you attach the studs.

11:24.500 --> 11:27.000
Only thing I recognized
in there was studs.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.633
This isn't going to work.

11:32.700 --> 11:33.967
Listen, it's <i>impossibile.</i>

11:34.033 --> 11:37.066
(speaking Italian)

11:37.133 --> 11:43.233
(speaking Italian)

11:43.300 --> 11:44.800
Vincenzo has a wonderful idea.

11:44.867 --> 11:47.266
He'll bring in his own crew
to help finish the job

11:47.333 --> 11:50.166
at no additional charge.

11:50.233 --> 11:52.166
Why would he do that?

11:52.233 --> 11:55.667
Because he's senile as a doorknob,
and stop asking questions.

11:55.734 --> 11:57.233
Eh?

11:57.300 --> 11:59.000
Hi, everybody.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.967
Al, what are you doing here?

12:01.033 --> 12:05.266
I thought about what you said.
You were absolutely right.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.467
I've been wasting my life.

12:06.533 --> 12:09.000
I'm so glad you feel that way.

12:09.066 --> 12:12.967
There's one dream I used to have,
sailing around the world.

12:13.033 --> 12:16.633
What better time to follow my dream
than during my retirement?

12:16.700 --> 12:18.767
I'm going to do it.

12:18.834 --> 12:20.700
You booked yourself on a cruise.

12:20.767 --> 12:24.033
I bought my own boat
and hired a crew.

12:24.100 --> 12:25.266
You what?

12:25.333 --> 12:28.333
It cost my life savings,
but I don't care.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.533
I'm sailing around the world
all because of you.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.133
And I want you
to come along with me.

12:42.367 --> 12:47.467
(serene music playing)

12:50.433 --> 12:53.500
Rose, what in hell are you doing?
It is 2am.

12:53.567 --> 12:58.166
I couldn't sleep, so I got up and
made a batch of Sparhuven Krispies.

13:00.467 --> 13:03.100
It's an ancient Scandinavian
midnight snack.

13:03.166 --> 13:05.800
I guess after a night
of pillaging and raping,

13:05.867 --> 13:08.834
a Viking wants a little something
to go with his cocoa.

13:10.467 --> 13:12.166
Well, they smell god-awful.

13:12.233 --> 13:15.000
Just when you're ready
to throw up from the stench,

13:15.066 --> 13:17.800
that's when they're done.
Who wants some?

13:19.400 --> 13:21.667
Rose, if these had been
offered to the donner party,

13:21.734 --> 13:24.166
they still would've eaten
each other.

13:24.233 --> 13:27.133
Don't be silly, Dorothy.
They're delicious.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.066
You just have to know
how to eat them.

13:29.133 --> 13:34.367
Hold your nose with one hand,
and pop a Krispie in with the other.

13:34.433 --> 13:36.300
Mm-mmm.

13:36.367 --> 13:39.300
That tastes like cheesecake,
fresh strawberries,

13:39.367 --> 13:41.000
and chocolate ice cream.

13:47.867 --> 13:48.967
My gosh, you're right.

13:49.033 --> 13:53.033
That is the best thing
I have ever tasted!

13:53.100 --> 13:55.166
Oh! This is delicious.

13:55.233 --> 13:56.600
Mmm.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.433
Hi, Ma.

14:00.767 --> 14:03.600
Give me a break.
You can't smell that from the hall.

14:11.900 --> 14:13.233
Sophia...

14:14.300 --> 14:16.433
Rose has been cooking.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.867
Yeah, and it turned out perfect.

14:18.934 --> 14:20.800
But I'm still upset.

14:20.867 --> 14:23.200
Because you don't know
what to do about Al?

14:23.266 --> 14:24.633
No, Blanche. She's upset

14:24.700 --> 14:27.767
because Jimmy Swaggart
can't cover his motel bill.

14:33.400 --> 14:36.700
Of course, I'm upset about Al.
I don't know what to do.

14:36.767 --> 14:40.533
If a man asked me to sail
around the world--

14:40.600 --> 14:43.133
Please. You can't get
asked out for coffee.

14:44.266 --> 14:46.567
Sail around the world.
That'll be the day.

14:46.633 --> 14:49.934
In fact, there's a line
waiting around the block.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.734
We'll install a ticket machine
like the bakery's.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.800
-Around the world, yeah.
-I get the picture, Ma!

15:00.533 --> 15:03.867
I'm afraid I'm responsible
for making Al do something

15:03.934 --> 15:05.900
he really doesn't want to do.

15:05.967 --> 15:08.600
So, what? Maybe you were.

15:08.667 --> 15:10.500
But it got him up off his duff.

15:10.567 --> 15:11.633
What's wrong with that?

15:11.700 --> 15:15.333
Absolutely the best thing
for him and for you, Rose.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.300
Have you even considered
accepting his offer?

15:18.367 --> 15:20.200
Oh, no. I couldn't.

15:20.266 --> 15:21.967
I have responsibilities.

15:22.033 --> 15:26.467
Haven't you ever done anything
just wild and crazy and impetuous?

15:26.533 --> 15:28.867
No. I'm from St. Olaf.

15:30.734 --> 15:33.100
We're forced to sign
a pledge when we're 15

15:33.166 --> 15:35.200
that we won't do those things.

15:35.266 --> 15:38.400
It keeps people from painting
their houses silly colors.

15:39.467 --> 15:41.500
I don't know what to do.

15:41.567 --> 15:43.200
I'll have to sleep on it.

15:43.266 --> 15:45.166
Sleep on it. Men. Sex.

15:45.233 --> 15:46.934
I listen to your sexual problems.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.667
How about my sexual problems?

15:48.734 --> 15:50.834
Ma, what is your sexual problem?

15:50.900 --> 15:52.533
I don't get any.

15:54.667 --> 15:58.400
I read in a magazine where a woman
is at her sexual peak at 83.

16:00.433 --> 16:04.467
I read that same article, honey.
It was 33.

16:04.533 --> 16:06.333
Really?

16:06.400 --> 16:10.500
Then all those feelings I've been
having lately must be colitis.

16:12.333 --> 16:14.533
Sorry I interrupted.
Good night.

16:16.934 --> 16:21.300
(calm music playing)

16:32.300 --> 16:34.233
(speaking Italian)

16:34.300 --> 16:35.500
Here they are, Dorothy.

16:35.567 --> 16:37.734
Vincenzo's new work crew.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.433
Looks like the road company
of <i>Cocoon.</i>

16:43.500 --> 16:44.734
Have a little respect.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.400
These are all masters
of their crafts.

16:46.467 --> 16:49.266
Hi, girls.
Who are all these old men?

16:49.333 --> 16:51.233
The Osmond Brothers, Rose.

16:52.533 --> 16:56.700
The years without Donny
have not been kind to them.

16:56.767 --> 16:59.200
These are Vincenzo's friends, Rose.

16:59.266 --> 17:01.333
Oh, that's right. I forgot.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.233
I've had so much
on my mind lately.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.133
Have you decided about Al?

17:05.200 --> 17:07.433
No. I'm just as confused as ever.

17:07.500 --> 17:11.800
(speaking Italian)

17:11.867 --> 17:14.333
Vincenzo thinks he has
a solution to your problem.

17:14.400 --> 17:18.533
Really?
Well, translate for me, Sophia.

17:18.600 --> 17:22.433
Well, I'm a little bit rusty,
but I think he said,

17:22.500 --> 17:26.166
picture it, Sicily, 1939.

17:26.233 --> 17:27.533
The war is on.

17:27.600 --> 17:30.433
A promising young architect
is offered a job

17:30.500 --> 17:34.000
to spearhead construction
of a new wing at the Vatican.

17:34.066 --> 17:39.033
Ma, you say your Italian is rusty,
but you know the word for spearhead?

17:39.100 --> 17:42.400
It was my brother's nickname
for a while as a child.

17:42.900 --> 17:46.467
Anyway, the young man is torn.

17:46.533 --> 17:50.667
Taking the train to Rome means
running the risk of enemy bombs.

17:50.734 --> 17:54.000
But staying home means passing up
a chance to make history.

17:54.066 --> 17:57.367
He certainly packs a lot
into a few words.

17:57.433 --> 17:58.900
Ah, shut up.

18:00.133 --> 18:02.967
In the end, he chooses safety.

18:03.033 --> 18:06.800
It's a decision he still regrets
half a century later.

18:07.934 --> 18:09.100
His conclusion?

18:09.600 --> 18:12.867
Life without risk is no life at all.

18:14.100 --> 18:17.467
Sophia, tell Vincenzo
that's a wonderful story.

18:17.533 --> 18:21.834
Tell him he helped me make the
most important decision of my life.

18:21.900 --> 18:26.400
I'm going to call Al and tell him
I'll sail around the world with him.

18:26.900 --> 18:30.266
Sophia, did Vincenzo
really say all that?

18:30.333 --> 18:32.233
Of course, not.

18:32.300 --> 18:34.400
He's a carpenter.
I'm a philosopher.

18:34.467 --> 18:38.233
He wants everyone out
until the work is completed.

18:38.300 --> 18:39.133
But why?

18:39.200 --> 18:41.500
Because to an old guy
with cataracts,

18:41.567 --> 18:43.266
you two look like
Swedish stewardesses.

18:44.767 --> 18:48.400
Old age can play
a lot of cruel jokes.

18:48.467 --> 18:49.767
Now come on.

18:52.700 --> 18:57.400
(serene music playing)

19:09.567 --> 19:12.333
Thanks for leaving me
at the parking lot.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.700
It's not like any unsavory,
swarthy characters

19:14.767 --> 19:16.000
hang around docks by night.

19:16.066 --> 19:18.266
Ma, there's nobody here like that.

19:18.333 --> 19:19.567
I know, but I gave it a minute.

19:19.633 --> 19:22.033
I thought I'd get you a date
for Saturday.

19:24.166 --> 19:26.834
Ahoy, girls!
Welcome aboard.

19:26.900 --> 19:30.300
-Rose, you must be so excited.
-Oh, I sure am.

19:30.367 --> 19:32.000
Listen, grab some champagne.

19:32.066 --> 19:36.000
I want to find Al.
I want to say thanks.

19:36.066 --> 19:38.967
-Ooh, I love champagne.
-Oh, me too.

19:39.033 --> 19:41.200
The only problem is,
after a few glasses,

19:41.266 --> 19:43.867
I'll kiss any man in sight.

19:43.934 --> 19:45.266
(splash)

19:45.333 --> 19:46.900
Man overboard!

19:52.867 --> 19:55.200
That was just a coincidence,
Dorothy.

19:58.567 --> 20:01.734
Hey, Al. I've been looking
all over for you.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.166
Really?
I haven't moved from this spot.

20:04.233 --> 20:06.166
There's something
I have to tell you.

20:06.233 --> 20:09.467
Oh, please, there's something
I want to say first.

20:09.533 --> 20:14.500
I want you to know that I am
so excited about going on this trip.

20:14.567 --> 20:19.033
And I'm so happy that you chose me
for this adventure.

20:19.100 --> 20:23.467
I love you, Al, and I'm ready
to go anywhere with you.

20:23.533 --> 20:26.066
And the north star can be our guide.

20:26.133 --> 20:27.800
I love you too, Rose.

20:27.867 --> 20:29.400
That's not the north star.

20:30.367 --> 20:32.934
That's the tower of the all-Spanish
radio station.

20:35.533 --> 20:38.467
Fine. Much more reliable.

20:38.533 --> 20:40.867
And it doesn't disappear
in the daylight.

20:40.934 --> 20:43.767
Rose, I think I'm going to puke.

20:45.266 --> 20:49.166
It was just a little joke, Al.
I laugh at all yours.

20:49.233 --> 20:52.166
No, I'm serious. I'm seasick.

20:52.233 --> 20:54.033
You mean it? We're still docked.

20:54.100 --> 20:56.000
I can't sail around the world.

20:56.066 --> 20:58.734
There's no adventure in me.
I'm sorry, Rose.

20:58.800 --> 21:02.000
Well, don't be sorry.

21:02.066 --> 21:07.166
Look what you were about to do,
what we were both about to do.

21:07.233 --> 21:08.800
We got on the ship.

21:08.867 --> 21:10.934
Most people never leave shore.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.667
-You mean that?
-Of course, I do.

21:13.734 --> 21:17.433
You and I have a lot of adventures
left in us.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.667
So many things
we haven't tried.

21:21.467 --> 21:24.700
Have you ever been to space mountain
at Disney world?

21:25.667 --> 21:26.967
Imagine it, Al.

21:27.033 --> 21:32.233
We go rocketing up and down,
and turn and turn, then zoom!

21:32.300 --> 21:35.400
Plummet right back down
and come...

21:38.533 --> 21:39.900
or we could just walk around

21:39.967 --> 21:42.033
and get our picture taken
with Goofy.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.467
(serene music playing)

21:49.967 --> 21:51.467
Hi, girls. How do I look?

21:51.533 --> 21:53.700
Where are you going all dolled up?

21:53.767 --> 21:56.500
We're picnicking
at an outdoor concert.

21:56.567 --> 21:59.567
-I didn't know al was a music lover.
-He isn't.

21:59.633 --> 22:02.800
He just likes to see what picnic
meats are popular this season.

22:04.033 --> 22:06.000
Come on.
Vincenzo says he's finished.

22:06.066 --> 22:09.533
-He wants us to take a look.
-Oh.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.834
Finally.

22:14.367 --> 22:16.900
-I don't believe it.
-This is terrible.

22:16.967 --> 22:21.266
Well, I'll admit it's a little drab,
but with some plants and some nice--

22:21.333 --> 22:24.233
It's a garage, you twit!

22:24.300 --> 22:26.033
Ma, how did this happen?

22:26.100 --> 22:30.734
Vincenzo.
(speaking Italian)

22:30.800 --> 22:32.433
(speaking Italian)

22:32.500 --> 22:37.633
(speaking Italian)

22:39.200 --> 22:41.066
It was a slight misunderstanding.

22:41.133 --> 22:44.000
You see, in Sicily,
every region has its own dialect.

22:44.066 --> 22:46.600
Actually, every town
has its own dialect.

22:46.667 --> 22:49.300
Actually, every household
has its own dialect.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.633
This also explains
why the Italian army

22:51.700 --> 22:54.700
is as effective as a Jamaican
bobsled team.

22:55.200 --> 22:59.633
(speaking Italian)

22:59.700 --> 23:02.233
(speaking Italian)

23:02.300 --> 23:06.300
He's sorry he made the mistake.
He'll turn this back into a bedroom.

23:06.367 --> 23:09.000
No. I could not live
through that again.

23:09.066 --> 23:12.600
Thank him for his work
and say he must be proud.

23:12.667 --> 23:14.600
<i>Grazie, Vincenzo.</i>

23:14.667 --> 23:18.600
(speaking Italian)

23:18.667 --> 23:20.600
<i>Mia figlia, Dorothy.</i>

23:20.667 --> 23:21.900
Dorothy.

23:24.767 --> 23:26.433
Dorothy, eh?

23:26.934 --> 23:27.834
Ma.

23:27.900 --> 23:30.934
I may have accidentally
promised your hand in marriage.

23:31.433 --> 23:33.133
Dorothy.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.367
Well, at least he's Italian.

23:36.533 --> 23:42.867
Dorothy.

23:44.400 --> 23:48.600
(theme music playing)
