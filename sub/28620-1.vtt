We're here.

- [Preston] Yes!

00:43.711 --> 00:47.212
(Preston humming tune)

00:49.450 --> 00:52.317
- [Woman] It says use side door.

(knocking)

01:14.642 --> 01:17.176
(knocking)

01:20.381 --> 01:21.547
- You woke me.

01:23.484 --> 01:24.583
- Captain Hagen?

01:24.585 --> 01:25.551
- Hãagen.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.386
- Captain Hãagen.

01:27.388 --> 01:28.420
I'm Preston Cooper.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.421
- Yeah?

01:29.423 --> 01:30.622
- This is my girlfriend, Sandra.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.491
We have a reservation.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.293
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.427
Of course, come in.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.462
Come in.

01:36.464 --> 01:37.663
(upbeat music)

01:37.665 --> 01:39.431
- [Preston] It's a
pleasure to meet you.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.800
- In Germany, we
say "guten morgen."

01:41.802 --> 01:43.635
It means "good morning."

01:43.637 --> 01:46.271
- Uh, it's 1:15.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.540
- Allow me one
minute to get my hat.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.543
(upbeat music)

01:51.545 --> 01:53.745
- [Preston] Wow, this
place is really cool.

01:53.747 --> 01:55.547
Right, honey?

01:55.549 --> 01:56.782
- [Sandra] Yeah, it's cute.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.585
But what is the deal
with the captain?

01:59.587 --> 02:01.753
- [Preston] All the reviews
said he's a great host.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.322
I'm sure that now
that he's awake,

02:03.324 --> 02:04.790
he'll be much more professional.

02:08.395 --> 02:11.196
- Pelton, Sasha, right this way.

02:11.198 --> 02:12.264
- It's Preston.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.232
- And Sandra.

02:15.870 --> 02:17.302
- Think we shoulda
brought the kids.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.237
- What are you talking about?

02:18.239 --> 02:19.171
The whole point of this vacation

02:19.173 --> 02:20.806
was to get away from the kids.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.274
- I know, I just,

02:23.444 --> 02:25.511
I'm just worried
about that babysitter.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.714
She looks like she
might be, you know,

02:28.716 --> 02:30.749
sexually active.

02:30.751 --> 02:31.650
- Shelley?

02:31.652 --> 02:32.851
She's a sweetheart.

02:34.221 --> 02:35.787
I am looking
forward to us being,

02:35.789 --> 02:38.223
you know, sexually active.

02:40.761 --> 02:41.660
- So am I.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.632
- Up we go.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.501
(humming tune)

02:57.611 --> 02:59.411
Right through here.

03:03.851 --> 03:04.683
Come on in.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.584
Watch your head.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.556
(groaning)

03:14.628 --> 03:16.261
(chuckling)

03:16.263 --> 03:16.962
Oooo.

03:17.932 --> 03:19.398
- [Wife] Use side door?

03:20.401 --> 03:22.868
(upbeat music)

03:36.550 --> 03:37.883
- [Captain] Hurry up.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.952
I have many guests
arriving soon.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.022
- Preston?

03:43.023 --> 03:44.456
- I'm really stuck
this time, honey.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.526
- You should have told me you
could not carry your own bags.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.794
Felix!

03:48.796 --> 03:50.229
- [Preston] I can
carry my own bags.

03:50.231 --> 03:50.829
I just need to come
up a real stair--

03:50.831 --> 03:52.431
- I am here, Papa.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.498
- Felix, help this
little man up the stairs.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.566
- That's okay, I think I got it.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.901
(groaning)

03:55.903 --> 03:56.868
- Felix!

03:56.870 --> 03:57.803
Schãtzchen schwein,

03:57.805 --> 03:59.638
you must push harder!

03:59.640 --> 04:00.806
- I try, Papa.

04:00.808 --> 04:01.607
- Felix!

04:01.609 --> 04:02.841
Push like you have

04:02.843 --> 04:04.743
a poop stuck in your

04:04.745 --> 04:06.478
arschloch!

04:06.480 --> 04:08.313
- Yeah, Papa, I will.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.717
I pushed out the poopie, Papa.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.385
- What?

04:13.387 --> 04:15.521
I just don't get what
was so great about Randy.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.656
I mean, he was
anti-environment, anti-animal,

04:17.658 --> 04:19.291
plus, he was mean to you.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.025
- You're right.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.893
I just need to break the bond.

04:21.895 --> 04:23.328
- What bond?

04:23.330 --> 04:24.563
- You know, like
the chemical bond.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.897
Like, I need to sleep
with somebody else.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.466
- Yeah, that's the spirit.

04:27.468 --> 04:28.267
- Yeah!

04:28.269 --> 04:29.268
I am gonna get laid.

04:29.270 --> 04:30.669
- Yeah!

04:30.671 --> 04:31.603
- Thank you.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.405
Jared, you're an amazing friend

04:33.407 --> 04:35.607
and hopefully you
will find someone

04:35.609 --> 04:37.676
to get laid with
too this weekend.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.811
- Yeah.

04:39.813 --> 04:40.912
Yeah, that'd be nice.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.616
(pleasant music)

04:47.554 --> 04:48.387
(thudding)
(groaning)

04:48.389 --> 04:49.288
- [Sandra] Preston?

04:50.658 --> 04:51.556
- I'm all right.

04:51.558 --> 04:52.691
I'm okay.

04:53.661 --> 04:54.993
(chuckling)

04:54.995 --> 04:56.395
- The upper loft.

04:57.564 --> 04:58.997
- Is this our room?

04:58.999 --> 05:00.432
- Of course it is.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.601
- This isn't even
a room, really.

05:02.603 --> 05:03.568
There's no bed.

05:03.570 --> 05:04.703
- You sleep here.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.339
- [Sandra] On the floor?

05:07.341 --> 05:08.740
(knocking)

05:11.412 --> 05:12.878
- Felix!

05:12.879 --> 05:14.345
Tell them I will be
down in one minute.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.716
- Papa will be down in a minute!

05:21.322 --> 05:22.788
- [Kate] Use side door.

05:25.726 --> 05:26.925
- [Lenny] Captain.

05:26.927 --> 05:27.926
Captain Hagen?

05:27.928 --> 05:28.927
- Hãagen.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.396
- I'm so sorry, Hãagen.

05:31.398 --> 05:33.031
Lenny, Lenny Kahn.

05:33.033 --> 05:33.865
This is my wife, Annabelle.

05:33.867 --> 05:37.069
- Come in.

05:37.071 --> 05:39.771
- Excuse me, you
can't park here.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.640
- You serious, bro?

05:41.642 --> 05:43.575
This isn't a chill
place to park?

05:43.577 --> 05:44.676
- No, it's not.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.578
You're in the
middle of the yard.

05:49.750 --> 05:50.816
- My wife, Christine

05:52.820 --> 05:55.120
and my mother, Oma.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.707
- Mrs. Hãagen, hello.

05:58.708 --> 06:00.758
I'm Annabelle, this
is my husband, Lenny.

06:00.761 --> 06:01.893
Mrs. Hãagen?

06:01.895 --> 06:03.729
- She can not hear you.

06:03.731 --> 06:07.032
- Sorry, bro, time
was of the essence.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.634
Surf boards were
getting a little loose.

06:09.636 --> 06:11.737
You know how Rico is
about his surfboard.

06:12.639 --> 06:14.139
- I don't know who Rico is,

06:14.141 --> 06:17.376
so how would I know how
he is with his surfboard?

06:17.378 --> 06:19.044
- Look at him.

06:19.046 --> 06:22.381
(intense rock music)

06:42.436 --> 06:44.069
- You need to move your car.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.137
- No problemo.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.773
As soon as Rico's done.

06:48.909 --> 06:52.043
(intense rock music)

06:54.681 --> 06:56.948
- It is a beautiful
room, Captain.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.718
This is our first vacation
in 11 years without the kids,

06:59.720 --> 07:01.853
so we're not used to
having our own room.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.455
One question, where do we?

07:08.862 --> 07:10.996
(knocking)

07:12.966 --> 07:13.865
- Hello?

07:15.436 --> 07:16.835
Anybody here?

07:16.837 --> 07:17.736
- It's a really nice--

07:20.641 --> 07:21.373
- It's great.

07:21.374 --> 07:22.106
Captain seems like a great guy.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.141
- Yep, he does.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.078
- Let's call the kids.

07:35.856 --> 07:36.755
- Hello.

07:40.494 --> 07:41.460
- Hello!

07:46.133 --> 07:48.099
- I must apologize
again for my mother.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.602
She is afraid of strangers.

07:50.604 --> 07:51.503
- Okay.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.207
What the fuck?

07:55.209 --> 07:58.076
(laughing)

07:58.078 --> 08:00.846
- Why did you book a
room with only one bed?

08:00.848 --> 08:03.114
- I didn't, I asked for two.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.483
I'll just sleep on
the floor, it's fine.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.651
- No, we can share the bed.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.552
- Really?

08:07.554 --> 08:08.787
- Yeah.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.055
It'll be like sleeping
next to my brother.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.926
- When you said we were
going to the Hamptons,

08:14.928 --> 08:18.530
I pictured myself lying
by the pool with a Cosmo,

08:18.532 --> 08:22.868
not jammed into some attic
like a bunch of old clothes.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.269
- We're not Jammed in here.

08:24.271 --> 08:25.871
There's plenty of space.

08:25.873 --> 08:29.641
There's gotta be like 50
to 60 square feet up here.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.977
And we got it all to ourselves.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.144
I'm gonna check
out the bathroom.

08:33.146 --> 08:34.846
I'm sure it's lovely.

08:34.848 --> 08:35.747
(groaning)

08:35.749 --> 08:37.616
- What up, roomies?

08:40.888 --> 08:42.020
- [Sandra] Oh my God.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.802
- Captain, there are two
other guys in our room.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.304
- You share the room with them.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.239
- I want to propose to my
girlfriend this weekend.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.074
She's not gonna say "yes"
if she's trapped up there

09:03.076 --> 09:04.809
with those two doofus surfers.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.811
- When I wanted to
impress my Christine,

09:06.813 --> 09:08.947
I would take her to the
bakery in the morning

09:08.949 --> 09:10.982
to smell the fresh baked bread.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.984
It delighted her so.

09:12.986 --> 09:13.985
- What?

09:13.987 --> 09:16.154
No, I need a better room

09:16.156 --> 09:18.290
or my girlfriend's
gonna make us leave.

09:18.292 --> 09:19.591
- You seem like a good junge.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.993
I'll tell you what I will do.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.296
You can have my room,
the master suite.

09:24.298 --> 09:25.931
- Really?

09:25.933 --> 09:27.799
- Costs you twice the
price of your current room.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.301
- Double the price,
I can't afford that.

09:29.303 --> 09:31.803
I don't even wanna tell you
how much I spent on the ring.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.789
I'll be in debt forever.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.774
- Do you want Felix to show
you where the bakery is?

09:35.776 --> 09:37.259
Felix!

09:37.260 --> 09:38.743
- I don't wanna know
where the bakery is.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.179
I need to make a
phone call or two.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.848
Hey, Blake.

09:43.850 --> 09:46.585
Sorry to call you like this
but I am in a bit of a jam.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.853
Cal, no, I'm good, listen.

09:48.855 --> 09:49.854
Seth!

09:49.856 --> 09:51.957
I need to borrow some money.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.358
Jeremy?

09:53.360 --> 09:55.860
I'll pay you back as
soon as I sell my novel.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.930
No, I understand.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.632
I understand completely.

10:00.634 --> 10:01.733
Don't worry about it.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.072
Dad.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.910
We'll take the master suite.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.979
If you could just hold
off on cashing this

10:13.981 --> 10:15.914
for three business days.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.949
- [Captain] Wunderbar

10:27.694 --> 10:30.095
(screaming)

10:36.303 --> 10:38.870
- This is so much
better, right honey?

10:40.974 --> 10:41.957
- Yeah, I love it.

10:41.958 --> 10:42.941
- [Young Man On Phone]
Okay, dad, we gotta go.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.242
- Wait, don't hang up!

10:44.244 --> 10:45.076
Damn it.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.046
- Put down the phone

10:48.882 --> 10:50.115
and pay attention to me.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.392
- Let's go meet the neighbors.

11:00.394 --> 11:01.826
- What neighbors?

11:01.828 --> 11:03.862
- Oh my God, I have a
unibrow in this picture.

11:03.864 --> 11:04.729
- Let me see.

11:04.731 --> 11:05.363
- No.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.831
- Knock, knock.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.333
We're the neighbors,
Lenny and Annabelle.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.769
- Okay, hi, I'm Kate.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.003
- I love your top.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.104
- Thank you.

11:13.105 --> 11:14.204
- [Lenny] And you are?
- [Jared] Jared.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.007
- Jared! What do
you do, young man?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.042
- I'm a software designer.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.977
- Oh, great, I have a computer.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.679
- Okay.

11:20.681 --> 11:24.382
- I sell office furniture
but my real passion is bees.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.316
- Bees?

11:25.318 --> 11:26.985
- Do you like bees, Jared?

11:26.987 --> 11:28.386
- No.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.421
- Oh.

11:29.423 --> 11:31.389
Do you like chocolate?

11:31.391 --> 11:32.424
- Sure.

11:33.860 --> 11:34.693
- You can have the rest.

11:34.695 --> 11:35.694
- No, thank you.

11:36.797 --> 11:37.962
- We've been married 23 years.

11:37.964 --> 11:40.298
We have two kids,
Maggie and Jimmy.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.900
Look, there they are.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.034
- Gotcha.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.103
- Do you guys have any kids?

11:45.105 --> 11:46.505
- No.

11:46.506 --> 11:47.906
- She doesn't even have
an engagement ring.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.841
- Why would you assume she
would have the engagement ring?

11:49.843 --> 11:51.443
Why couldn't I have
the engagement ring?

11:51.445 --> 11:53.178
It's gender normatize.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.046
- Afraid to commit, huh?

11:55.048 --> 11:56.347
I remember that time.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.049
I'm going to have to
sleep with only this woman

11:58.051 --> 11:59.050
for the rest of my life?

11:59.052 --> 12:00.018
What?!

12:00.020 --> 12:01.152
Here's the thing, Junior--

12:01.154 --> 12:02.253
- We're just friends.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.488
- [Lenny] What?

12:03.490 --> 12:05.423
- Yeah, we've been best
friends since college.

12:08.395 --> 12:11.229
(somber music)

12:29.049 --> 12:30.281
- [Darren] Down!

12:30.283 --> 12:31.015
- [Rico] I've got
it, I've got it.

12:31.017 --> 12:31.750
- Time!

12:31.752 --> 12:32.517
Flip it up.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.185
- He's beautiful.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.188
Like I can't even handle it.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.223
- You're beautiful.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.091
- I know.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.026
But seriously, like,

12:42.028 --> 12:43.394
who has abs like that?

12:43.396 --> 12:45.196
Like, oh my God.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.272
- Yo, Captain.

12:54.274 --> 12:57.041
Me and Rico wanna
practice in the water.

12:57.043 --> 12:59.444
Is it safe to go
in the bay here?

12:59.446 --> 13:01.179
- Yeah, why not?

13:01.181 --> 13:04.449
- We didn't know if there
were jellyfish and sharks.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.218
(screaming)

13:07.220 --> 13:09.053
- [Rico] Or swordfish.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.055
We don't wanna get stabbed.

13:11.057 --> 13:12.090
- [Darren] True.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.794
- I was having a
father-son talk with Felix

13:15.796 --> 13:18.196
about what it means to be a man.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.231
Perhaps you would
like to listen.

13:21.802 --> 13:25.136
- Actually, we're just in the
middle of a practice sesh--

13:25.138 --> 13:26.271
- Sit down.

13:26.273 --> 13:27.405
- Okay.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.811
- Hey, looks like everyone's
hanging out in the backyard.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.813
- The fish inside a jellyfish.

13:34.815 --> 13:37.048
This fish is swimming.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.083
- Oh God, here
come the neighbors.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.201
- Ugh.

13:40.202 --> 13:41.318
Let's pretend like
we're making out.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.453
- Wait, what?

13:44.491 --> 13:47.091
- Let's go see what
those guys are doing.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.194
- I think you wanna
be the jellyfish.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.864
- Hey, guys, mind
if we join you?

13:52.866 --> 13:54.499
- Oh, you're welcome.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.235
However, I'm afraid
it is for men only.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.269
- Oh.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.888
Okay.

13:59.889 --> 14:01.506
I guess I'll catch up
with you later, dear.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.150
So, what're we talking about?

14:12.152 --> 14:13.117
Sports?

14:13.119 --> 14:14.919
Meat?

14:14.921 --> 14:15.620
Bees?

14:17.090 --> 14:19.357
- Well actually, I was
teaching my son and the junge

14:19.359 --> 14:22.160
what it means to be a man.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.895
So prepare to listen.

14:23.897 --> 14:27.265
- With all due respect,
Captain, I'm a father myself.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.200
I'm not sure I need any lessons.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.870
- Well then perhaps you
have something to teach.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.758
- Hey, what happened?

14:36.759 --> 14:38.242
- I don't know but
they say it's men only.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.377
(laughing)

14:39.379 --> 14:40.445
- That's so sexiest.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.616
It's discriminatory
against women.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.317
- [Kate] Why don't
you hang out with us?

14:46.319 --> 14:47.218
- Kate.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.386
- What? I feel bad.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.256
Seriously, pop a squat.

14:52.325 --> 14:53.224
- Okay.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.564
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.299
- No, no, no, it's okay.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.533
Really, I'll sit on the ground.

15:02.535 --> 15:03.935
- I'll get up.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.470
- No, I'll sit on the
ground, it's okay.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.575
- My dad was a dick
pretty much all the time,

15:10.577 --> 15:13.311
so the only thing
I've learned from him

15:13.313 --> 15:15.546
was how to be an asshole.

15:15.548 --> 15:16.648
- Yeah.

15:16.650 --> 15:18.249
Felix is a mother's boy too.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.351
- I am?

15:20.353 --> 15:21.552
- Yes you are.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.655
Your mother, may
she rest in heaven,

15:23.657 --> 15:25.189
treated you like a baby,

15:25.191 --> 15:28.326
so you did not become a man.

15:28.328 --> 15:31.329
And even though you are 19
years old, you are still a baby.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.033
- I don't want to be a baby.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.335
- I think what the
captain's trying to say

15:37.337 --> 15:41.572
is when you grow up you have
to start doing things yourself.

15:41.574 --> 15:45.410
You can't rely on
your parents anymore.

15:45.412 --> 15:46.978
- Danke, Dennis.

15:46.980 --> 15:47.712
- Yeah.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.982
Dankadens.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.250
That was deep.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.935
- Did you just call me--

15:53.936 --> 15:55.619
- In Germany, when we agree
with something that was said,

15:55.622 --> 15:57.689
we say "stimmt."

15:57.691 --> 16:00.158
It means "I agree."

16:00.160 --> 16:01.025
- Stimmt.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.261
Cool.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.199
- What about you, Dennis?

16:08.201 --> 16:09.534
- Lenny.

16:09.536 --> 16:10.635
- What troubles you?

16:12.005 --> 16:13.371
- Nothing.

16:13.373 --> 16:14.205
I'm great.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.573
Glad to be here.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.241
- I could not help but notice

16:17.243 --> 16:20.078
that you gleefully sent
your wife away like she was

16:20.080 --> 16:22.747
a Jew in France in 1393.

16:23.616 --> 16:24.515
- What?

16:26.419 --> 16:28.252
I don't, I didn't.

16:28.254 --> 16:30.755
I don't get the
France reference,

16:30.757 --> 16:32.357
I mean, my wife is Jewish,

16:32.359 --> 16:34.459
but I didn't gleefully.

16:34.461 --> 16:38.296
You said men only, so
technically you sent her away.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.165
Guys?

16:41.167 --> 16:42.066
Back me up?

16:43.570 --> 16:45.670
Does anyone else
wanna say something?

16:48.341 --> 16:49.440
Hello?

16:50.343 --> 16:51.275
Hi, hi!

16:51.277 --> 16:52.377
Hi, sir!

16:53.279 --> 16:54.679
Coming to join our meeting?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.114
- What?

16:56.116 --> 16:57.448
No, I just wanna ask
the captain something.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.300
- What is it, Pelton?

16:59.301 --> 17:01.151
- Do you have those things
that we talked about earlier?

17:01.154 --> 17:02.020
- Yeah.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.023
Okay, junge.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.491
We must adjourn the meeting.

17:06.493 --> 17:08.226
We meet again tomorrow.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.164
- Stimmt.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.298
(laughing)

17:14.300 --> 17:16.601
- Good, junge. Good.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.336
- Good, junge. Good.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.573
- Bro, what're you doing?

17:22.575 --> 17:24.442
- Good, junge. Good.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.276
(laughing)

17:25.278 --> 17:26.210
- Felix!

17:26.212 --> 17:27.378
Felix, you touch too much.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.447
- Good, junge. Good!

17:29.449 --> 17:31.315
- Come, come, come.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.388
(somber music)

17:47.100 --> 17:49.734
(pleasant music)

17:51.438 --> 17:55.406
Christine used to keep
candles here, somewhere.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.575
- We haven't been
properly introduced.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.243
Lenny, Lenny Kahn.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.311
- Hi.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.512
I'm Preston Cooper.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.514
- What're you fellas up to?

18:03.516 --> 18:05.850
- I asked the captain to
find some candles for me.

18:05.852 --> 18:08.486
I'm gonna make a candlelit
dinner for my girlfriend.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.720
- Oh, great.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.456
That's so romantic.

18:11.458 --> 18:12.723
- Thanks.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.859
- Do you mind if my
wife and I join you?

18:14.861 --> 18:15.760
- What's that?

18:15.762 --> 18:18.463
(upbeat music)

18:18.465 --> 18:20.398
- Captain, I'm home!

18:24.771 --> 18:26.671
- Why are you taking
so many pictures?

18:26.673 --> 18:28.539
- Send to my kids.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.809
This is daddy's new
friend, Preston.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.745
We're cooking dinner together.

18:34.747 --> 18:35.880
(phone chiming)
Oh.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.348
"Who gives a crap?"

18:38.184 --> 18:39.117
Wasn't very nice.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.587
Oh, smell that.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.689
The ladies are gonna love it.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.457
This is romantic.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.593
All of us having
dinner together.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.662
- All of us having
dinner together outside

18:51.664 --> 18:54.132
but each person will
have their own space.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.134
- Well, I would hope so

18:56.136 --> 18:57.535
because I'm not
sitting on your lap.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.871
(laughing)

18:59.873 --> 19:00.738
- Maybe I'm not being clear.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.306
You will be on the deck

19:02.308 --> 19:04.442
and I'm gonna be
on the bay side.

19:04.444 --> 19:07.095
It's kind of a
special dinner for me,

19:07.096 --> 19:09.747
so I am gonna keep our line
demarcation where it is, okay?

19:11.217 --> 19:13.417
- We're not at war, are we?

19:13.419 --> 19:14.585
(laughing)

19:14.587 --> 19:15.753
- Not yet.

19:15.755 --> 19:18.589
(upbeat music)

20:04.637 --> 20:07.672
(pleasant music)

20:43.443 --> 20:44.642
- Where are we going?

20:44.644 --> 20:45.643
(laughing)

20:45.645 --> 20:46.744
- You'll see.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.452
Wait, stay here for
one second, honey.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.620
- Preston, what do you mean?

20:55.622 --> 20:56.921
- No! No! No! No!

20:56.923 --> 20:57.955
- What up, roomie?

20:57.957 --> 20:59.590
I mean, ex-roomie.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.325
- What the hell
are you guys doing?

21:01.327 --> 21:03.694
I made that dinner for
me and my girlfriend!

21:03.696 --> 21:04.528
- What?

21:04.530 --> 21:06.497
Oh, shit.

21:06.499 --> 21:07.898
We thought it was for us.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.735
- Why would I make
dinner for you?

21:10.737 --> 21:12.403
- We didn't know you made it.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.589
We thought it was the captain.

21:14.590 --> 21:16.774
You know, they charge
it to the room and shit.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.611
(groaning)

21:25.551 --> 21:27.285
- [Preston] Okay.
- [Sandra] Preston?

21:27.287 --> 21:29.387
- It's going to be okay. We're
gonna get a different dinner.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.621
Just come this way.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.289
- [Maggie On Phone]
We're hanging up now.

21:31.291 --> 21:31.889
- Love you, bye.

21:36.663 --> 21:37.962
- Surprise.

21:37.964 --> 21:41.565
We are having dinner
with Lenny and,

21:41.567 --> 21:44.568
um, his wife.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.638
- Oh, wow.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.607
(foreign language TV)

21:49.609 --> 21:51.909
(laughing)

21:53.012 --> 21:55.579
- Now the life of the
hive is no picnic.

21:55.581 --> 21:57.548
You know, there's a lot of work.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.850
Those bees work
themselves to death

21:59.852 --> 22:02.753
and guess who does all the work.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.989
When they have sex
with the queen,

22:04.991 --> 22:06.424
they die.

22:06.426 --> 22:08.092
(laughing)

22:08.094 --> 22:08.926
Can you believe it?

22:08.928 --> 22:10.394
That's their life.

22:10.396 --> 22:11.962
The queen does, on
her maiden flight,

22:11.964 --> 22:13.464
when she's just hatched,

22:13.466 --> 22:15.666
she flies out into
that drone cloud.

22:15.668 --> 22:18.602
A lot of people think it's
the males but it's not.

22:18.604 --> 22:19.870
They're the drone bees

22:19.872 --> 22:21.539
and they don't do a thing.

22:21.541 --> 22:22.873
They get blocked
out of the hive.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.408
They freeze to death.

22:25.078 --> 22:27.378
That's what some women should do

22:27.380 --> 22:29.413
to deadbeat boyfriends, right?

22:29.415 --> 22:30.648
(laughing)

22:30.650 --> 22:31.916
- [Sandra] I have to go to bed.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.651
- What about dessert?

22:33.653 --> 22:34.585
- [Sandra] Goodnight.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.354
- She's not a big desert person.

22:36.356 --> 22:37.488
- Ah.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.023
Well, I'll save you a slice.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.424
- Great, thanks.

22:40.426 --> 22:41.125
Goodnight.

22:42.762 --> 22:43.828
- Goodnight.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.831
(somber music)

22:46.833 --> 22:50.368
(television commotion)

22:54.741 --> 22:55.773
Hey, fellas!

22:55.775 --> 22:57.475
You want some pie?

22:57.477 --> 22:59.910
We can't possibly eat
this whole thing ourself.

22:59.912 --> 23:02.780
- Oh, hell yeah.

23:02.782 --> 23:05.116
(slurping)

23:06.686 --> 23:08.819
I feel bad though.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.921
He made it special
for his girl and shit.

23:10.923 --> 23:13.391
- You didn't do it
on purpose, right?

23:13.393 --> 23:14.625
- No, man.

23:14.627 --> 23:15.760
We thought it was
in there for us.

23:15.762 --> 23:17.795
- No, thanks, I don't smoke.

23:17.797 --> 23:18.963
- Why not?

23:18.965 --> 23:20.798
- He had a bad
experience in college.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.666
Talks about it all the time.

23:22.668 --> 23:23.868
- [Darren] What happened?

23:23.870 --> 23:25.102
- Nothing,

23:25.104 --> 23:28.072
I just freaked out and
everyone made fun of me.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.708
- Come on, man, you're
amongst friends.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.843
Nobody's gonna make fun of you.

23:32.845 --> 23:33.844
- I don't know.

23:33.846 --> 23:35.813
- No one's gonna
make fun of you.

23:35.815 --> 23:36.647
- I ju--

23:36.649 --> 23:37.815
- Hit it now!

23:41.721 --> 23:44.789
(coughing)

23:44.791 --> 23:46.690
(laughing)

23:46.692 --> 23:47.591
- Yes!

23:48.461 --> 23:49.693
- You had two cookies.

23:49.695 --> 23:50.828
- That's a lie.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.730
- There were four on the plate

23:52.732 --> 23:55.533
and I ate two and you ate two.

23:55.535 --> 23:56.200
- Stop.

23:58.704 --> 24:00.771
(groaning)

24:05.978 --> 24:09.880
(coughing)
(laughing)

24:09.882 --> 24:12.817
(gasping)

24:12.819 --> 24:14.268
- What's wrong?

24:14.269 --> 24:15.718
- I thought I butt
Skyped the kids

24:15.721 --> 24:17.121
and they saw me smoking pot.

24:19.826 --> 24:20.791
What was that look?

24:20.793 --> 24:21.725
- What look?

24:21.727 --> 24:23.561
- That look you just gave Rico.

24:23.563 --> 24:24.662
Was that about me?

24:24.664 --> 24:25.629
Are you making fun of me?

24:27.533 --> 24:28.149
- No.

24:28.150 --> 24:28.766
I mean, yeah, it was about you

24:28.768 --> 24:30.801
but we weren't
making fun of you.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.103
(laughing)

24:34.240 --> 24:35.739
- What's so funny?

24:35.741 --> 24:36.974
Are you laughing at me?

24:36.976 --> 24:40.878
- I was just thinking about
the last time I smoked.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.582
Are you feeling all right, dear?

24:44.584 --> 24:46.217
- No, I'm not feeling all right.

24:47.220 --> 24:48.686
I have to lay down.

24:51.524 --> 24:54.492
- [Darren] Uh, thanks
for dessert and stuff.

24:54.494 --> 24:55.860
We'll take care of the pipe.

25:04.871 --> 25:05.970
- Hello?

25:06.739 --> 25:07.638
Lenny?

25:08.875 --> 25:11.542
(somber music)

25:15.548 --> 25:17.047
- Preston,

25:17.049 --> 25:18.816
are you okay?

25:18.818 --> 25:20.251
- Oh yeah, I'm fine, honey.

25:20.253 --> 25:21.719
I'll be out in a second.

25:22.655 --> 25:25.890
(dramatic beat music)

25:30.963 --> 25:32.162
Honey?

25:32.164 --> 25:34.164
Do you mind taking
off your mask?

25:34.166 --> 25:39.236
¶ Preston's got something
he wants to show you ¶

25:40.239 --> 25:42.573
- Yo, Preston, can we come in?

25:44.544 --> 25:46.810
Preston, we brought
you a piece of pie.

25:48.548 --> 25:49.880
Sandra, we would've
brought you one

25:49.882 --> 25:52.783
but Lenny said you don't
get down with desserts.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.268
- What?

25:54.269 --> 25:55.752
- Darren, you can't
come into our room.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.021
- I hope we're not interrupting.

25:57.023 --> 25:57.855
- You are.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.323
- But me and Rico,

25:59.325 --> 26:01.992
we feel really bad about
fucking up your dinner

26:01.994 --> 26:03.827
and we wanna take
you out for drinks.

26:03.829 --> 26:06.964
We're headed to
the bar right now.

26:06.966 --> 26:07.998
You cats ready to roll?

26:09.869 --> 26:10.968
- We're in bed.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.073
So, no.

26:27.019 --> 26:27.918
- Yeah.

26:31.824 --> 26:32.723
Hello?

26:35.962 --> 26:36.860
Dennis?

26:39.165 --> 26:40.064
Dennis?

26:40.900 --> 26:42.666
Dennis?

26:42.668 --> 26:46.637
(mumbling in foreign language)

26:55.047 --> 26:56.113
Felix!

26:56.115 --> 26:57.014
- Yes, Papa.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.849
(shushing)

26:58.851 --> 27:00.351
- Come with me, now.

27:00.353 --> 27:01.952
- I'm busy.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.321
- Let go of your schmeckel
and come help me.

27:04.323 --> 27:06.323
- It feels very good, Papa.

27:06.325 --> 27:09.026
Can I help you and hold my
schmeckel at the same time?

27:09.028 --> 27:10.928
(yelling in foreign language)

27:10.930 --> 27:13.731
- One of our guests
is dead on the deck!

27:13.733 --> 27:14.865
- Who is it?

27:14.867 --> 27:15.766
- Dennis.

27:17.169 --> 27:18.369
- Who?

27:18.371 --> 27:19.370
- The bald man
who wants everyone

27:19.372 --> 27:21.939
to see pictures of his children.

27:21.941 --> 27:22.973
- Oh, him?

27:24.143 --> 27:25.943
I thought his name was Lenny.

27:25.945 --> 27:28.078
- Whatever his name is,

27:28.080 --> 27:31.048
we must get rid of his body!

27:31.050 --> 27:33.183
Or else we will
be run out of town

27:33.185 --> 27:36.987
like the Muslims were
run out of Spain in 1609.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.122
So come on!

27:39.825 --> 27:40.824
- Yah!

27:40.826 --> 27:43.894
(somber beat music)

28:02.948 --> 28:05.082
(grunting)

28:06.085 --> 28:09.119
(water sloshing)

28:15.061 --> 28:17.061
(groaning)

28:17.063 --> 28:19.263
Is this good, Papa?

28:19.265 --> 28:20.197
- Okay.

28:20.199 --> 28:24.068
(counting in foreign language)

28:25.271 --> 28:26.737
(splashing)

28:26.739 --> 28:29.440
(yelling)

28:29.442 --> 28:30.474
Dennis!

28:30.476 --> 28:31.341
Gottverdammt!

28:31.343 --> 28:32.309
He lives!

28:32.311 --> 28:33.744
- What happened?!

28:33.746 --> 28:35.112
- We threw you in the water.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.013
- What?!

28:36.015 --> 28:37.114
Why did you do that?

28:37.116 --> 28:38.415
- We thought you were dead.

28:38.417 --> 28:40.017
- I'm not dead!

28:40.019 --> 28:41.085
- You were lying there.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.252
You seemed dead.

28:42.254 --> 28:43.954
- Didn't you check my pulse?

28:43.956 --> 28:44.888
- No.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.523
We had to get rid of the body.

28:46.524 --> 28:48.157
Do you have any idea what would
happen if anyone found out?

28:48.160 --> 28:49.426
- No, I don't!

28:49.428 --> 28:51.995
- We would be run out of
Spain like the Muslims.

28:51.997 --> 28:52.830
- What?!

28:52.832 --> 28:54.131
- Oh, come in, come in.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.966
We will take care of you.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.901
Felix will microwave
you some soup.

28:57.903 --> 28:58.802
Campbell's.

28:58.804 --> 28:59.436
Have you had it?

28:59.438 --> 29:00.971
Oh, it's delicious.

29:06.011 --> 29:07.945
- I'm gonna go take a hot bath.

29:07.947 --> 29:09.213
- Oh, can I join?

29:10.049 --> 29:11.749
- I mean, I should
probably wash off first

29:11.751 --> 29:13.851
if we're gonna get
naked together, right?

29:15.421 --> 29:17.955
(giggling)

29:21.060 --> 29:23.994
- Would you like some bread?

29:23.996 --> 29:26.447
- No, thank you.

29:26.448 --> 29:28.899
- Not the Vunderbread you
have down at the deli.

29:28.901 --> 29:33.771
But some real German bread.

29:33.773 --> 29:34.471
Okay.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.173
Hi.

29:37.476 --> 29:40.310
(pleasant music)

29:42.148 --> 29:43.847
- Oh.

29:43.849 --> 29:44.782
That is good bread.

29:44.784 --> 29:45.849
(speaking foreign language)

29:45.851 --> 29:49.186
- Here.

29:49.188 --> 29:50.087
Good.

29:54.426 --> 29:56.860
(laughing)

29:56.862 --> 29:59.329
(somber music)

30:10.075 --> 30:12.109
(water sloshing)

30:12.111 --> 30:14.044
- That was a fantastic date.

30:15.114 --> 30:18.248
Do you wanna go
back to my bedroom?

30:19.418 --> 30:20.818
- Well,

30:20.820 --> 30:23.086
that all depends
on the size of your

30:23.088 --> 30:23.987
baggage.

30:26.091 --> 30:26.924
(zipping)

30:26.926 --> 30:29.259
(boinging)

30:31.263 --> 30:32.162
(beat music)

30:32.164 --> 30:33.864
- That's right,

30:33.866 --> 30:37.201
I'm Barry Largo and this is
my Penis Enlargement Program.

30:37.203 --> 30:39.870
(beat music)

30:42.942 --> 30:44.474
Welcome back to the Barry Largo

30:44.476 --> 30:46.343
Penis Enlargement Program.

30:46.345 --> 30:47.878
All right, guys,

30:47.880 --> 30:49.546
get a bunch of
lube on your cocks

30:49.548 --> 30:52.482
because this is gonna
be a real workout.

30:52.484 --> 30:54.251
Once you're fully lubed up,

30:55.354 --> 30:57.421
take your thumb
and your forefinger

30:57.423 --> 30:59.957
and put on the
base of your penis.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.525
Then with your other hand,

31:01.527 --> 31:03.360
firmly stretch

31:04.363 --> 31:06.196
and push.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.265
What you're doing here
is pushing the blood

31:08.267 --> 31:11.068
up your penis to the head

31:11.070 --> 31:14.238
and you're gonna get
more girth, more length.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.405
And that's what we all want.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.474
That's what the ladies want.

31:17.476 --> 31:20.978
Girls love big dicks.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.379
- Did you get some work done?

31:22.381 --> 31:24.448
- Yeah, work was good

31:24.450 --> 31:25.349
and done.

31:26.886 --> 31:29.086
- Thank you so much for this.

31:29.088 --> 31:31.588
This is exactly what I needed.

31:36.262 --> 31:37.327
What're you doing?

31:37.329 --> 31:39.229
- What're you doing?

31:39.231 --> 31:40.330
- You just kissed me.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.065
- You just kissed me.

31:43.168 --> 31:45.135
- I was trying to
kiss you on the cheek.

31:45.137 --> 31:48.105
- I was trying to
kiss you on the cheek.

31:48.107 --> 31:48.972
- Okay.

32:19.238 --> 32:20.404
- Where have you been?

32:21.373 --> 32:22.239
- Nowhere.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.207
Captain thought I was dead

32:24.209 --> 32:26.143
so he and Felix threw
me into the bay.

32:27.947 --> 32:28.578
Goodnight.

32:28.580 --> 32:29.479
- What?

32:30.482 --> 32:32.149
Seriously, where were you?

32:32.151 --> 32:33.383
- I just told you.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.319
- You expect me to
believe that story?

32:35.321 --> 32:37.120
- Annabelle, where
else would I be?

32:37.122 --> 32:39.189
- I don't know, you're not here.

32:39.992 --> 32:41.158
The whole point of this trip

32:41.160 --> 32:42.643
was for us to spend
time together.

32:42.644 --> 32:44.127
You've been avoiding
me the entire time.

32:44.129 --> 32:45.462
- What're you talking about?

32:45.464 --> 32:47.197
We're having a
great trip together.

32:47.199 --> 32:48.098
- Lenny,

32:49.068 --> 32:50.334
you're not hearing me.

32:50.336 --> 32:51.468
I'm really upset.

32:52.471 --> 32:53.403
We have a problem.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.975
- I don't know what to say.

32:59.178 --> 33:00.043
I love you?

33:01.647 --> 33:02.546
- Forget it.

33:04.049 --> 33:06.516
(somber music)

33:29.308 --> 33:32.042
- I would like to see you
kiss a real woman goodnight

33:32.644 --> 33:35.345
instead of an urn full of ashes.

33:36.448 --> 33:38.048
- Gute nacht, Oma.

33:40.119 --> 33:41.018
- Okay.

33:42.121 --> 33:44.588
(somber music)

33:47.526 --> 33:49.693
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:54.199 --> 33:57.734
(speaking foreign language)

34:05.811 --> 34:07.310
- Hi.

34:07.312 --> 34:08.412
- Hey.

34:10.416 --> 34:13.383
- Uh, I'm just
gonna go downstairs.

34:20.259 --> 34:21.358
- Preston?

34:21.360 --> 34:23.693
Yo, Preston?

34:23.695 --> 34:25.362
Preston!
(Preston gasping)

34:25.364 --> 34:26.730
Are you awake?

34:26.732 --> 34:27.664
- I am now.

34:27.666 --> 34:29.399
What're you doing in our room?

34:29.401 --> 34:31.068
- Do you have any condoms?

34:32.204 --> 34:35.138
At least one but if
you have two, great.

34:35.140 --> 34:38.208
Rico usually likes to
go for a second round.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.376
- I don't have any condoms!

34:39.378 --> 34:40.377
Get out of our room!

34:40.379 --> 34:42.112
- Are you sure?

34:42.113 --> 34:43.846
- Yes, I'm sure, Sandra
is on birth control.

34:43.849 --> 34:45.148
Get out of here!

34:45.150 --> 34:47.517
- Oh, shit.

34:47.519 --> 34:48.485
Thanks anyway.

34:48.487 --> 34:49.319
- Okay.

34:53.392 --> 34:54.524
- Preston?

34:54.526 --> 34:55.459
- What?

34:55.461 --> 34:56.493
- Goodnight.

34:56.495 --> 34:57.561
- Goodnight!

35:00.265 --> 35:02.432
(moaning)

35:03.202 --> 35:04.534
- Yo, Rico.

35:05.504 --> 35:07.270
No-go on the glove-o.

35:07.272 --> 35:08.638
She's on the pilly.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.640
- That works, ask her for one.

35:10.642 --> 35:11.508
- Good call.

35:12.878 --> 35:16.179
(door creaking)

35:16.181 --> 35:16.880
Sandra.

35:19.351 --> 35:20.283
Sandra.

35:20.285 --> 35:21.718
- Darren, don't you dare!

35:21.720 --> 35:22.752
- Don't worry, Preston.

35:22.754 --> 35:24.554
I'm not gonna bother you again.

35:24.556 --> 35:26.189
I have a question for Sandra.

35:26.191 --> 35:28.191
Sandra, are you awake?

35:28.193 --> 35:29.126
- What?

35:29.128 --> 35:29.860
- Do you think I could barrow

35:29.862 --> 35:31.828
one of your birth control pills?

35:31.830 --> 35:33.363
It's for Rico.

35:33.365 --> 35:34.764
- Are you serious?

35:34.766 --> 35:36.466
- No, shit,

35:36.468 --> 35:38.301
not for Rico to take.

35:38.303 --> 35:40.804
See, he's working
his magic on a lady

35:40.806 --> 35:42.772
and stupid me forgot the condoms

35:42.774 --> 35:45.308
and Preston said that
you have some, so.

35:46.445 --> 35:50.480
- Okay, you know that's not
how birth control works, right?

35:50.482 --> 35:53.350
You can't just take
it right before sex.

35:53.352 --> 35:54.551
- Can you take them after sex?

35:54.553 --> 35:56.236
- No.

35:56.237 --> 35:57.920
It takes like a month
before it starts to work.

35:57.923 --> 35:58.822
- Really?

36:00.425 --> 36:01.424
That's stupid.

36:01.426 --> 36:02.559
- Get out of our room!

36:02.561 --> 36:04.561
- I'm out! I'm out!

36:04.563 --> 36:05.795
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

36:11.370 --> 36:16.439
- Oh my God.

36:25.284 --> 36:26.449
(thudding)

36:26.451 --> 36:28.518
- What're you doing?

36:28.520 --> 36:30.220
- I have to use the toilet.

36:30.222 --> 36:31.588
- Felix, you can't
come into our room

36:31.590 --> 36:33.323
without announcing yourself.

36:33.325 --> 36:34.558
- I need to go pee-pee.

36:36.528 --> 36:37.627
- Get out!

36:43.535 --> 36:46.336
(sexual moaning)

37:00.719 --> 37:02.919
(moaning)

37:04.856 --> 37:07.724
(somber music)

37:10.529 --> 37:12.529
- Jared, what's up bro?

37:20.472 --> 37:21.371
- Hey.

37:22.908 --> 37:26.509
What're you doing?

37:26.511 --> 37:27.711
- Nothing.

37:27.713 --> 37:28.878
- Is that alcohol?

37:32.017 --> 37:35.285
(crickets chirping)

37:36.655 --> 37:38.255
- [Jared] Sounds like
he's trying too hard.

37:38.257 --> 37:38.922
- Yeah.

37:40.025 --> 37:42.425
He's always putting
on a show for me.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.527
I thought he was really
funny and clever at first

37:44.529 --> 37:47.030
but now it's getting
kind of annoying.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.431
Preston means well

37:48.433 --> 37:50.634
but he doesn't have
any fun anymore.

37:55.407 --> 37:56.373
- It's a little harsh.

37:56.375 --> 37:57.474
Watch out.

37:57.476 --> 37:58.775
(groaning)

37:58.777 --> 38:00.810
- Oh my God.

38:01.947 --> 38:03.913
Thanks for warning
me ahead of time.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.515
- Sorry.

38:05.517 --> 38:07.317
- I'm just kidding,
don't worry about it.

38:07.319 --> 38:09.919
(pleasant music)

38:19.765 --> 38:21.364
- Honey, where were you?

38:23.969 --> 38:25.502
- Shit!

38:25.504 --> 38:27.737
(moaning)

38:30.409 --> 38:31.041
- Yes!

38:31.043 --> 38:31.941
Randy!

38:33.512 --> 38:35.812
- Um, my name's not Randy.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.781
- Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

38:37.783 --> 38:38.882
Keep going.

38:38.884 --> 38:40.650
- Wait.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.385
Is my name Randy?

38:42.387 --> 38:44.087
(moaning)

38:44.089 --> 38:45.955
You know the sex is good

38:45.957 --> 38:48.858
when you can't
remember your own name.

38:48.860 --> 38:49.726
- Yeah!

38:49.728 --> 38:50.827
- Randy.

38:52.564 --> 38:53.463
Randy?

38:55.334 --> 38:56.733
Randy?

38:56.735 --> 38:59.703
- I'm sorry, can you
please just be quiet?

38:59.705 --> 39:00.770
- Ran

39:01.740 --> 39:02.639
Dee.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.910
- So what's the deal
with you and Kate?

39:09.014 --> 39:10.513
- No deal, we're friends.

39:16.355 --> 39:17.487
- This is disgusting.

39:18.757 --> 39:20.023
Pretty sure it's cooking brandy.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.691
- Well it's doing the trick.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.595
- You won't believe what
just happened with Darren.

39:25.597 --> 39:27.664
He came into my room.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.733
He thought that you could
use birth control pills

39:29.735 --> 39:31.368
like a condom.

39:31.370 --> 39:33.636
(laughing)

39:33.638 --> 39:35.839
- God, they're so
stupid, both of them.

39:35.841 --> 39:36.673
I mean,

39:36.675 --> 39:39.542
"Hey, I'm Rico.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.611
"Work out, bro?

39:41.612 --> 39:43.679
"I've got two six packs
because one wasn't enough."

39:43.682 --> 39:44.614
(giggling)

39:44.616 --> 39:45.582
- "Yo, brah.

39:45.584 --> 39:46.883
"Like, I'm Darren

39:46.885 --> 39:48.952
"and I'm like so good at surfing

39:48.954 --> 39:51.087
"I could just like
do it in the yard."

39:51.089 --> 39:52.589
(laughing)

39:52.591 --> 39:54.824
- You saw them surfing
in the yard today?

39:54.826 --> 39:56.092
Did you see them while
they were in the bay?

39:56.094 --> 39:56.926
- They were?

39:56.928 --> 39:58.595
- [Jared] Surfing?

39:58.597 --> 40:00.096
- [Sandra] There are no waves.

40:00.098 --> 40:00.930
- I know.

40:00.932 --> 40:02.966
(giggling)

40:02.968 --> 40:03.900
Wait, wait, wait.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.669
This morning they pulled in,

40:06.671 --> 40:08.738
Darren was in the
passenger's seat, right,

40:08.740 --> 40:13.610
and Rico was behind the
car kissing his surfboard.

40:13.612 --> 40:15.162
- [Sandra] What?

40:15.163 --> 40:16.713
- Then he poured a bottle
of water on his head

40:16.715 --> 40:17.781
and shook his head around

40:17.783 --> 40:20.817
like he was a
Victoria Secret model.

40:20.819 --> 40:23.720
(laughing)

40:23.722 --> 40:25.054
I really don't like that guy.

40:30.862 --> 40:33.797
(lock clicking)

40:51.850 --> 40:53.216
Where were you?

40:53.218 --> 40:55.652
- Hey, just went
to the bathroom.

40:56.555 --> 40:57.987
- For two hours?

40:57.989 --> 40:59.189
- Yeah, I couldn't sleep,

40:59.191 --> 41:02.058
so I took a walk around
the neighborhood.

41:10.936 --> 41:12.269
- Felix!

41:12.270 --> 41:13.603
- What the fuck are you doing?!

41:13.605 --> 41:14.904
- I'm announcing myself.

41:16.875 --> 41:21.945
- Oh my God.

41:22.481 --> 41:25.114
(pleasant music)

41:28.253 --> 41:30.920
(upbeat music)

41:41.833 --> 41:42.932
- Felix!

41:45.670 --> 41:49.539
(yelling in foreign language)

41:53.778 --> 41:55.979
(sighing)

41:58.884 --> 41:59.849
(gasping)

41:59.851 --> 42:01.150
- Good morning, beautiful.

42:02.120 --> 42:06.289
¶ You are so beautiful ¶

42:06.291 --> 42:09.092
¶ In the morning,
Preston's girl ¶

42:09.094 --> 42:12.695
¶ Is so beautiful ¶

42:12.697 --> 42:14.030
¶ Every morning, waking up ¶

42:14.032 --> 42:16.032
- Preston, please stop.

42:16.034 --> 42:17.600
- All right.

42:17.602 --> 42:19.836
Well, I got an idea for you.

42:19.838 --> 42:21.137
¶ Breakfast in bed ¶

42:21.139 --> 42:22.906
¶ Breakfast in bed ¶

42:22.908 --> 42:24.841
¶ Preston's gonna get you
some breakfast in bed ¶

42:24.843 --> 42:25.909
(door opening)

42:25.911 --> 42:27.277
Darren?

42:27.278 --> 42:28.644
I swear to God if
you're coming in to.

42:29.848 --> 42:31.014
- Sardine?

42:31.883 --> 42:33.182
- What? No.

42:33.184 --> 42:35.985
I was just gonna go out
and get some breakfast.

42:35.987 --> 42:37.987
- This is breakfast.

42:37.989 --> 42:38.922
- Are you kidding me?

42:41.927 --> 42:42.892
(thudding)
(screaming)

42:42.894 --> 42:44.327
- Sardine?

42:44.329 --> 42:46.596
- Fuck, Felix, you can't
come into our room like that!

42:51.570 --> 42:53.002
- [Kate] Darren, Rico?

42:53.004 --> 42:55.004
We going to the beach or what?

42:55.006 --> 42:56.606
- Yo, Darren, come on let's go.

42:56.608 --> 43:00.243
- Hey, okay, but don't
bang her out again.

43:00.245 --> 43:03.580
I'm telling you, Jared
was really pissed.

43:03.582 --> 43:05.615
- All right, all right.

43:05.617 --> 43:06.816
- [Kate] Darren, Rico!

43:06.818 --> 43:07.884
Let's go!

43:10.755 --> 43:11.754
- Whoa!

43:11.756 --> 43:12.989
Shit!

43:12.991 --> 43:14.657
This place is like
a haunted house.

43:14.659 --> 43:15.959
- Sardine?

43:15.961 --> 43:16.859
- Oh, hell yeah.

43:17.729 --> 43:20.196
(crunching)

43:20.198 --> 43:22.165
- Guys, let's go.

43:22.167 --> 43:23.132
- All right, yo.

43:26.171 --> 43:27.070
- [Rico] Hold up!

43:28.373 --> 43:30.223
- Where's Jared?

43:30.224 --> 43:32.074
- I don't know, he said he
had a lot of work to do.

43:32.077 --> 43:34.310
- Oh, bummer.

43:34.312 --> 43:38.715
- Felix, are you coming
to the beach with us?

43:39.918 --> 43:41.117
- Double bummer.

43:43.054 --> 43:45.888
(dramatic music)

43:59.704 --> 44:00.803
- [Barry] That's
what we all want.

44:00.805 --> 44:02.338
That's what the ladies want.

44:02.340 --> 44:07.110
(door creaking)
Girls love big dicks!

44:13.852 --> 44:14.751
- Hello?

44:18.823 --> 44:21.024
- [Barry] So keep pushing.

44:21.026 --> 44:23.993
Keep pushing the
blood up to the head.

44:23.995 --> 44:25.328
Up to the head.

44:25.330 --> 44:26.429
Three more.

44:26.431 --> 44:28.064
Two.

44:28.066 --> 44:29.165
One.

44:29.934 --> 44:31.834
Zero, all right guys.

44:31.836 --> 44:34.103
Shake it out,
shake it out, yeah.

44:34.105 --> 44:35.905
So, let's switch it up.

44:35.907 --> 44:38.141
Put your right hand around
the base of the penis

44:38.143 --> 44:40.343
and with your left hand

44:40.345 --> 44:43.012
push the blood to the head.

44:43.014 --> 44:45.114
Push the blood to the head.

44:45.116 --> 44:48.084
(gasping)

44:48.086 --> 44:49.185
- Felix, what the fuck?

44:49.187 --> 44:50.953
Get out from underneath there!

44:51.956 --> 44:53.556
Dude, I told you,

44:53.557 --> 44:55.157
you can't keep coming
into our room like that!

44:55.160 --> 44:58.027
- Is that what I must
do to make the sex?

44:58.029 --> 44:58.995
- What?

45:01.366 --> 45:02.665
- That.

45:02.666 --> 45:03.965
Is that what I must
do to make the sex?

45:05.070 --> 45:06.869
- Why are you asking
me that question?

45:07.906 --> 45:10.173
- I want to make the sex.

45:10.175 --> 45:12.141
Must I make my schmeckel bigger?

45:13.378 --> 45:14.877
- Your schmeckel?

45:16.147 --> 45:18.981
- [Barry] Up your
penis to the head.

45:18.983 --> 45:20.983
This causes enlargement.

45:20.985 --> 45:22.985
The blood causes enlargement.

45:22.987 --> 45:24.120
Say it with me, guys.

45:34.032 --> 45:37.166
(whooshing)

45:37.168 --> 45:40.136
(intense rock music)

46:03.361 --> 46:07.163
(intense rock music)

46:07.165 --> 46:09.132
(whistling)

46:09.134 --> 46:12.235
(water trickling)

46:17.942 --> 46:19.342
- What're you doing, bro?

46:19.344 --> 46:20.543
Jared, remember?

46:20.545 --> 46:22.145
- I'm sorry.

46:22.147 --> 46:25.314
Kate makes me
forget about things.

46:25.316 --> 46:27.049
- I know, bro.

46:27.051 --> 46:28.117
I know.

46:31.456 --> 46:32.789
- Captain?

46:32.791 --> 46:34.090
Captain?

46:34.092 --> 46:35.258
Captain?

46:35.260 --> 46:36.159
Captain?

46:37.295 --> 46:38.094
Captain, can I talk
to you for a second?

46:38.096 --> 46:39.428
- What is it, Pelton?

46:39.430 --> 46:41.230
- People keep coming
into our room.

46:41.232 --> 46:42.331
Darren, Rico, Felix.

46:42.333 --> 46:44.000
It's unacceptable.

46:44.002 --> 46:45.067
- Come with me.

46:45.069 --> 46:46.235
We will talk about it.

46:46.237 --> 46:48.070
- Come where you where?

46:48.072 --> 46:49.872
- Sorry, bro.

46:49.874 --> 46:52.909
I wanted to make it up to
you that we took your dinner.

46:52.911 --> 46:56.078
And then I thought, who
better to ask for a condom

46:56.080 --> 46:59.148
than the guy banging out the
hottest girl in the house?

46:59.150 --> 47:02.451
- Darren, you can't come
into our room uninvited.

47:02.453 --> 47:04.187
- Did I interrupt something?

47:04.189 --> 47:06.322
You seem like you guys
were just chilling.

47:06.324 --> 47:08.090
- It doesn't matter
what we were doing.

47:08.092 --> 47:10.193
You can't come into our room.

47:10.195 --> 47:13.596
But, as a matter of fact,
you did interrupt something.

47:13.598 --> 47:16.232
I've been trying to propose
to my girlfriend all weekend

47:16.234 --> 47:18.201
and you guys keep messing it up.

47:18.203 --> 47:19.468
- Are you serious, bro?

47:21.239 --> 47:22.305
Shit!

47:23.241 --> 47:25.141
- We cockblocked
our boy Preston.

47:25.143 --> 47:27.977
We promised never to
cockblock any of our boys.

47:27.979 --> 47:28.878
- Shit!

47:30.048 --> 47:30.947
Shit.

47:32.050 --> 47:33.015
I fucked it up.

47:34.152 --> 47:35.218
I'm worthless.

47:36.287 --> 47:38.120
I'm a worthless piece of shit.

47:38.122 --> 47:40.289
- Is that what you believe

47:40.291 --> 47:42.992
or is that what your
father says about you?

47:42.994 --> 47:44.193
- Huh?

47:44.195 --> 47:45.428
- Well, it is one
thing for your father

47:45.430 --> 47:46.929
to say something about you

47:46.931 --> 47:49.165
but it is another for
you to believe it.

47:51.169 --> 47:53.536
- Darren, I didn't
mean to single you out.

47:53.538 --> 47:55.204
- As for you, Pelton.

47:55.206 --> 47:57.473
You blame the junge
for blocking your cock,

47:57.475 --> 48:00.409
but you could be asking
your lady's hand in marriage

48:00.411 --> 48:02.278
as we speak, could you not?

48:02.280 --> 48:04.180
- I'm not gonna propose
in the middle of the day.

48:04.182 --> 48:05.414
- Why not?

48:05.416 --> 48:06.382
- Because we just got
back from the beach.

48:06.384 --> 48:07.617
Everyone's just hanging around.

48:07.619 --> 48:09.585
(speaking foreign language)

48:09.587 --> 48:11.287
- What is really stopping you?

48:11.289 --> 48:13.289
- I need everything
to be perfect.

48:13.291 --> 48:14.257
- Why?

48:14.259 --> 48:16.359
- Because it's a proposal.

48:16.361 --> 48:18.928
- What are you afraid of?

48:18.930 --> 48:19.562
- What do you think?

48:19.564 --> 48:21.163
That she'll say no.

48:21.165 --> 48:23.032
- Yeah, now we're
getting somewhere.

48:24.302 --> 48:26.002
Why are you afraid?

48:27.372 --> 48:29.038
- I just am.

48:29.040 --> 48:31.340
- Preston, I've been there.

48:31.342 --> 48:33.242
I had a million doubts
running through my head

48:33.244 --> 48:34.944
when I proposed to Annabelle.

48:35.947 --> 48:38.047
You just gotta go for it.

48:38.049 --> 48:39.348
She'll say yes.

48:39.350 --> 48:41.984
(somber music)

48:43.187 --> 48:45.521
- [Kate] Oh my Lord, are they
having another men's meeting?

48:45.523 --> 48:46.489
- [Annabelle] Yep.

48:47.358 --> 48:48.958
- Hey, are you okay?

48:48.960 --> 48:50.259
- I'm a little tired.

48:50.261 --> 48:52.261
I didn't get a lot
of sleep last night.

48:52.263 --> 48:55.097
Someone was having
very loud sex.

48:55.099 --> 48:56.849
- Oh.
(laughing)

48:56.850 --> 48:58.600
- I thought you and
Jared were just friends.

48:58.603 --> 49:00.136
- Oh, we are.

49:00.138 --> 49:01.003
- Well then who?

49:03.107 --> 49:04.040
- Rico.

49:05.643 --> 49:07.076
- Wow.

49:07.078 --> 49:08.244
How did that happen?

49:08.246 --> 49:10.713
- [Lenny] No, I don't want that.

49:10.715 --> 49:11.714
- What do you want?

49:12.984 --> 49:14.583
- [Lenny] I wanna
make love to my wife.

49:15.486 --> 49:17.353
- And what is stopping you?

49:17.355 --> 49:18.454
- I don't know.

49:20.558 --> 49:23.359
I know it sounds terrible but

49:23.361 --> 49:25.361
I'm just not attracted
to her anymore.

49:27.465 --> 49:30.466
(dramatic music)

49:32.236 --> 49:33.703
I'm sorry.

49:33.705 --> 49:35.171
I don't know what to do.

49:39.744 --> 49:42.411
(somber music)

50:11.776 --> 50:14.377
- I can't believe you're
mad that I proposed to you.

50:14.379 --> 50:16.412
- It was so embarrassing!

50:16.414 --> 50:18.080
Why would you think
it was a good idea

50:18.082 --> 50:20.383
to gather all the people in
the restaurant around our table

50:20.385 --> 50:22.051
and then propose to me?

50:22.053 --> 50:23.552
- Because I wanted
to make it special.

50:23.554 --> 50:26.655
- And that song, oh my God.

50:26.657 --> 50:28.591
- Baby, you love my songs.

50:28.593 --> 50:29.658
- Preston,

50:29.660 --> 50:32.428
I can't stand your songs.

50:32.430 --> 50:33.462
- Baby, you do not mean that.

50:33.464 --> 50:35.364
- Get away from me!

50:35.366 --> 50:38.034
(somber music)

50:39.771 --> 50:41.237
- But I love you.

50:41.239 --> 50:43.205
- I can't do this anymore.

50:43.207 --> 50:44.073
- Do what?

50:44.776 --> 50:46.475
- We have to break up.

50:49.647 --> 50:50.479
- I don't understand.

50:50.481 --> 50:51.814
What did I do wrong?

50:51.816 --> 50:52.815
- Nothing.

50:52.817 --> 50:54.450
You rock.

50:54.452 --> 50:57.053
I just can't do my
man Jared like that.

50:57.055 --> 50:58.287
- What?

50:58.289 --> 50:59.588
What does Jared have
to do with this?

50:59.590 --> 51:00.823
- Duh!

51:00.825 --> 51:03.592
He's in love with
you, you know that.

51:03.594 --> 51:05.494
- No I don't.

51:05.496 --> 51:06.629
He's never said
anything like that.

51:06.631 --> 51:08.664
He's not in love with me.

51:08.666 --> 51:10.433
- I'm sorry, dude.

51:10.435 --> 51:11.400
Bros before hoes.

51:12.837 --> 51:13.669
(smacking)

51:13.671 --> 51:15.271
- Fuck you!

51:17.508 --> 51:18.357
- Whoa.

51:18.358 --> 51:19.207
This is crazier than the time

51:19.210 --> 51:21.777
Lucy found the used condom
in Eugen's bike helmet.

51:21.779 --> 51:23.646
- Fuck you two, Darren.

51:23.648 --> 51:25.281
Jesus.

51:25.283 --> 51:27.450
(crying)

51:27.452 --> 51:28.350
- Shit.

51:29.187 --> 51:30.519
- What was I supposed to do?

51:30.521 --> 51:32.588
If I hooked up with
Kate, I hurt Jared.

51:32.590 --> 51:34.790
If I didn't, I hurt Kate.

51:34.792 --> 51:36.459
- It was a suicide mission.

51:37.762 --> 51:40.262
(groaning)

51:41.332 --> 51:44.266
- [Annabelle] I
want you to fuck me.

51:44.268 --> 51:45.367
- I can't get an erection.

51:45.369 --> 51:47.103
- What's the problem?

51:47.105 --> 51:49.505
- I don't know, it's
just not working.

51:49.507 --> 51:50.573
(sighing)

51:50.575 --> 51:53.175
- You don't want to
have sex with me,

51:53.177 --> 51:54.543
you don't wanna talk to me,

51:54.545 --> 51:56.378
you don't even wanna
be alone with me.

51:56.380 --> 51:57.780
- That's not true.

51:57.782 --> 51:59.748
- And you won't acknowledge
there's a problem.

51:59.750 --> 52:02.251
Do you know how small
that makes me feel?

52:02.253 --> 52:04.186
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

52:05.556 --> 52:08.324
I really think you're making
a mountain out of a molehill.

52:08.326 --> 52:09.825
- Oh, fuck you, Lenny.

52:11.496 --> 52:12.628
I don't want you in this room.

52:12.630 --> 52:14.130
Find someplace else to sleep.

52:14.132 --> 52:15.464
- What? You don't mean that.

52:15.466 --> 52:16.699
- Now.

52:16.701 --> 52:19.535
(somber music)

52:36.854 --> 52:39.188
(crying)

52:45.696 --> 52:46.562
- What's wrong?

52:49.400 --> 52:50.266
- Nothing.

52:51.702 --> 52:52.668
- Are you sure?

52:52.670 --> 52:54.703
- Yes, I'm fine. Go away.

52:59.343 --> 53:00.609
- You know, the captain has

53:00.611 --> 53:03.212
this really tasty
bread from Germany.

53:03.214 --> 53:04.446
I don't know what it's called.

53:04.448 --> 53:06.815
All I know is it's not
called Vunderbread.

53:06.817 --> 53:08.684
(chuckling)

53:08.686 --> 53:11.620
Anyway, I was gonna make
myself a grilled cheese.

53:12.490 --> 53:13.589
You want one?

53:15.626 --> 53:17.726
- You know, like,
bro code or whatever,

53:17.728 --> 53:20.863
which is stupid because
Jared hates Rico.

53:22.233 --> 53:23.549
Rico is just a rebound

53:23.550 --> 53:24.866
but when two guys break up
with you in the same week,

53:24.869 --> 53:26.602
like that really
hurts, you know?

53:28.239 --> 53:28.938
- Hey,

53:30.341 --> 53:31.240
look at me.

53:32.543 --> 53:33.842
That's their loss.

53:35.680 --> 53:37.580
A guy would have to
be stupid or dead

53:37.582 --> 53:38.814
not to wanna be with you.

53:40.651 --> 53:43.219
I wouldn't give those
dolts a second thought.

53:44.922 --> 53:45.854
- Thanks, Lenny.

53:47.692 --> 53:49.225
And thank you for
this grilled cheese.

53:49.227 --> 53:50.893
You're right, this
bread is amazing.

53:52.230 --> 53:52.928
- I know.

54:06.811 --> 54:08.277
Leave it to the Germans.

54:10.615 --> 54:13.249
(somber music)

54:18.556 --> 54:20.589
(sighing)

54:23.327 --> 54:24.627
Honey, wake up.

54:26.364 --> 54:27.429
I wanna make love.

54:27.431 --> 54:28.664
- You do?

54:28.666 --> 54:29.531
- Yeah.

54:30.768 --> 54:32.868
I'm sorry about the
way I've been acting.

54:34.305 --> 54:35.738
You've just been mom so long,

54:36.807 --> 54:39.642
it took me awhile to
see you as lover again.

54:39.644 --> 54:41.277
But I'm there now.

54:49.620 --> 54:50.786
(gasping)

54:50.788 --> 54:52.655
- What are you doing?

54:52.657 --> 54:54.690
- I just took my bath with Oma.

54:54.692 --> 54:55.858
Same time every night.

54:56.994 --> 54:59.495
- Okay, well that's weird.

54:59.497 --> 55:02.031
- Do you want to see my
big schmeckel workout?

55:02.033 --> 55:02.931
- What?

55:08.572 --> 55:10.673
- I make my schmeckel bigger.

55:10.675 --> 55:12.508
Do you want to make the sex now?

55:14.378 --> 55:16.612
(moaning)

55:22.720 --> 55:24.953
(sighing)

55:31.762 --> 55:34.797
(sexual moaning)

55:45.743 --> 55:47.676
- Oh yes!

55:47.678 --> 55:48.744
Yes!

55:48.746 --> 55:49.745
Oh!

55:49.747 --> 55:51.980
(sighing)

55:57.822 --> 56:00.656
(somber music)

56:12.803 --> 56:17.873
- Just what I was looking for.

56:21.645 --> 56:23.645
- Stuff is really terrible.

56:23.647 --> 56:24.546
- Mhmm.

56:27.952 --> 56:28.984
So what's with you?

56:29.787 --> 56:31.120
- I broke up with Preston.

56:32.423 --> 56:33.655
- Really?

56:33.657 --> 56:35.057
- I just couldn't
take it anymore.

56:37.895 --> 56:39.628
- Poor guy.

56:39.630 --> 56:40.763
- Poor guy?

56:41.766 --> 56:44.032
He was smothering me.

56:44.034 --> 56:45.768
Why am I the bad guy?

56:45.770 --> 56:47.903
- No, you're not the bad guy.

56:48.906 --> 56:50.806
I'm just frustrated.

56:50.808 --> 56:54.977
Women seem to go for
big guys with big dicks.

56:54.979 --> 56:56.779
- What're you talking about?

56:56.781 --> 56:58.647
Big dicks?

56:58.649 --> 56:59.948
Is that really what you think?

56:59.950 --> 57:00.883
- Yeah.

57:00.885 --> 57:02.785
That's what women want, right?

57:02.787 --> 57:03.886
- No.

57:04.755 --> 57:07.189
Not really.

57:07.190 --> 57:09.624
Definitely not more than
a lot of other things.

57:09.627 --> 57:11.026
- Like what?

57:11.028 --> 57:13.195
- Confidence, honesty.

57:15.766 --> 57:17.433
You really think
that Kate is gonna

57:17.435 --> 57:19.701
one day realize she's in love
with you and come running?

57:19.703 --> 57:20.936
- No, this isn't about Kate.

57:20.938 --> 57:23.772
I'm just talking in
general, most people.

57:23.774 --> 57:24.673
Nevermind.

57:25.476 --> 57:26.175
- Jared,

57:26.977 --> 57:28.210
you love her.

57:31.182 --> 57:33.449
You're so passive.

57:33.451 --> 57:34.516
Be a man.

57:35.820 --> 57:36.785
Tell her how you feel.

57:39.457 --> 57:41.890
(somber music)

58:38.849 --> 58:40.115
- [Captain] Guten morgen.

58:42.887 --> 58:45.053
- Sorry, I didn't see you there.

58:45.055 --> 58:48.690
- You must stop apologizing
for being alive in the world.

58:49.894 --> 58:51.093
Sit down.

58:51.095 --> 58:52.561
- No thanks.

58:52.563 --> 58:54.963
Kinda wanna be alone right now.

58:54.965 --> 58:56.098
- Please?

58:56.100 --> 58:57.766
I want you to hear this too.

58:58.936 --> 59:00.035
- Fine.

59:09.680 --> 59:11.713
- I was just saying that

59:11.715 --> 59:13.916
I had sex with
Annabelle last night

59:14.952 --> 59:18.253
but I was thinking about
Kate the whole time.

59:18.255 --> 59:19.721
I feel terrible.

59:19.723 --> 59:23.725
I couldn't even look my wife
in the eye this morning.

59:25.629 --> 59:27.729
- What's wrong with that, Lenny?

59:27.731 --> 59:29.865
- Lenny, what's
so bad about that?

59:29.867 --> 59:31.833
Whole time I was
banging out Charlene,

59:31.835 --> 59:33.602
I was thinking
about other girls.

59:33.604 --> 59:34.336
- You were?

59:34.338 --> 59:36.572
- Every dude does that, Lenny.

59:36.574 --> 59:37.239
- Really?

59:37.241 --> 59:38.840
(chuckling)

59:38.842 --> 59:41.009
- No wonder you can not
make love to your wife,

59:41.011 --> 59:42.945
you poor bauerntölpel.

59:42.947 --> 59:46.715
I used to watch "Ich Ficke
Deine Mutter und Schwester"

59:46.717 --> 59:49.217
before I made love
to my Christine.

59:49.219 --> 59:50.118
- What's that?

59:50.120 --> 59:51.353
- Pornographic film.

59:51.355 --> 59:53.021
Very popular in Germany.

59:53.023 --> 59:54.623
- Whoa, porn?

59:54.625 --> 59:56.224
I don't know about that.

59:57.361 --> 59:58.594
That's nearly cheating.

59:58.596 --> 59:59.928
I love my wife.

59:59.930 --> 1:00:01.930
- And I didn't love mine?

1:00:01.932 --> 1:00:04.199
You arschgefickter hurensohn!

1:00:05.769 --> 1:00:07.970
Your wife cannot feel your
love if you lie next to her

1:00:07.972 --> 1:00:10.872
like a wertlos scheissekopf!

1:00:11.976 --> 1:00:14.376
You must do whatever it takes
to sex her all the time.

1:00:16.313 --> 1:00:18.113
- I make a sex last night, Papa.

1:00:18.983 --> 1:00:20.849
- Not now, Felix.

1:00:21.986 --> 1:00:26.955
Do you realize how little time
your really have with her?

1:00:27.958 --> 1:00:29.324
You must love her every moment.

1:00:33.097 --> 1:00:35.263
(crying)

1:00:36.767 --> 1:00:37.666
- Preston.

1:00:41.038 --> 1:00:43.138
- Let him go where he must.

1:00:45.175 --> 1:00:46.675
- Sandra dumped me.

1:00:47.845 --> 1:00:49.978
I proposed to her
and she dumped me.

1:00:51.749 --> 1:00:54.416
I shoulda become an
accountant like my father,

1:00:54.418 --> 1:00:55.884
then I would've had the money

1:00:55.886 --> 1:00:57.085
to give her the
life she deserves.

1:00:58.022 --> 1:00:59.888
Been able to buy
her a better car.

1:00:59.890 --> 1:01:01.289
Take her to a better
bed and breakfast.

1:01:01.291 --> 1:01:02.357
No offense, Captain.

1:01:03.761 --> 1:01:05.961
- When I wanted to
impress my Christine,

1:01:05.963 --> 1:01:08.263
I would take her to the
bakery in the morning

1:01:08.265 --> 1:01:11.700
to smell the fresh baked bread.

1:01:11.702 --> 1:01:13.402
- I know, you told me.

1:01:13.404 --> 1:01:14.970
I fail to see the relevance.

1:01:14.972 --> 1:01:17.339
- That's because you are
not really listening.

1:01:18.776 --> 1:01:21.143
I took Christine
to smell the bread

1:01:21.145 --> 1:01:25.080
because I could not
afford to buy the bread.

1:01:25.082 --> 1:01:27.215
Your woman wants you to
take care of her, yeah,

1:01:27.217 --> 1:01:28.850
but not with money.

1:01:30.087 --> 1:01:31.086
With love.

1:01:31.088 --> 1:01:32.154
- I do love her.

1:01:32.156 --> 1:01:33.722
- No, not really.

1:01:33.724 --> 1:01:34.990
Oh, you're nice to her.

1:01:34.992 --> 1:01:36.625
You kiss her, you
do what you think

1:01:36.626 --> 1:01:38.259
a man who loves a woman
is supposed to do.

1:01:40.097 --> 1:01:43.365
But you are not capable
of truly loving her

1:01:44.234 --> 1:01:46.301
until you love yourself.

1:01:46.303 --> 1:01:48.704
And that is the real problem.

1:01:48.706 --> 1:01:51.073
You do not love yourself.

1:01:52.076 --> 1:01:53.375
- Stimmt.

1:01:53.377 --> 1:01:54.443
- Stimmt.

1:01:54.445 --> 1:01:56.111
- Stimmt.

1:01:56.113 --> 1:01:58.714
(somber music)

1:02:11.962 --> 1:02:12.861
- Hey.

1:02:21.805 --> 1:02:23.171
- Hey.

1:02:23.173 --> 1:02:25.140
Can I tell you about last night?

1:02:25.142 --> 1:02:26.141
- Maybe I shoulda
never hooked up

1:02:26.143 --> 1:02:28.143
with Kate in the first place.

1:02:28.145 --> 1:02:30.512
- You let your shmeckel
do the thinking.

1:02:30.514 --> 1:02:33.148
- I think we've all
been guilty of that.

1:02:33.150 --> 1:02:34.516
- Let your brain do the thinking

1:02:34.518 --> 1:02:36.318
and your shmeckel
do the talking.

1:02:37.187 --> 1:02:38.086
- Stimmt.

1:02:39.323 --> 1:02:40.222
- Stimmt.

1:02:43.761 --> 1:02:44.926
- Speaking of Jared.

1:02:46.830 --> 1:02:48.363
- Should I ask him to join us?

1:02:48.365 --> 1:02:50.065
- No, the junge is hurting.

1:02:51.034 --> 1:02:52.501
Let's go to him.

1:02:52.503 --> 1:02:55.270
(pleasant music)

1:03:15.225 --> 1:03:16.291
- What's happening?

1:03:16.293 --> 1:03:17.125
- Jonas--

1:03:17.127 --> 1:03:18.126
- Captain, may I?

1:03:19.196 --> 1:03:20.095
- Please.

1:03:20.998 --> 1:03:22.097
- Jared,

1:03:22.099 --> 1:03:23.965
this is a safe place

1:03:25.002 --> 1:03:26.301
and we all wanna help.

1:03:27.204 --> 1:03:29.271
We know you're in
pain around Kate

1:03:29.273 --> 1:03:31.273
and around having a small penis.

1:03:31.275 --> 1:03:32.307
- What?

1:03:32.309 --> 1:03:33.909
I don't have a small penis.

1:03:34.978 --> 1:03:36.545
- Felix told us about
the dick workout.

1:03:40.150 --> 1:03:42.083
- So what do you think turned
him on all of a sudden?

1:03:42.085 --> 1:03:43.151
- I don't know.

1:03:43.153 --> 1:03:44.252
All I know is that I liked it

1:03:44.254 --> 1:03:45.987
and I'm not gonna question it.

1:03:45.989 --> 1:03:48.023
Sometimes it's best
not to analyze.

1:03:48.025 --> 1:03:49.825
- I know what you mean.

1:03:49.827 --> 1:03:52.194
- I also had some really
good sex last night.

1:03:52.196 --> 1:03:54.095
- I know, I heard
you and Rico again.

1:03:54.097 --> 1:03:55.297
- No, not Rico.

1:03:56.466 --> 1:03:57.833
It was Felix.

1:03:58.502 --> 1:03:59.334
- Felix?

1:03:59.336 --> 1:04:00.168
- Yeah.

1:04:00.170 --> 1:04:02.370
(laughing)

1:04:04.942 --> 1:04:06.541
- I'm sorry for
banging out Kate.

1:04:06.543 --> 1:04:08.176
I shouldn't have done that.

1:04:08.178 --> 1:04:09.945
- Don't forget about the anal.

1:04:09.947 --> 1:04:11.146
- Oh yeah, also--

1:04:11.148 --> 1:04:12.180
- Please don't.

1:04:12.182 --> 1:04:14.016
- We did anal.

1:04:14.017 --> 1:04:15.851
- That means instead of doing
sex regular in the front,

1:04:15.853 --> 1:04:17.052
they did it in the back.

1:04:17.054 --> 1:04:18.887
- Yeah, I know what
anal is, Darren.

1:04:18.889 --> 1:04:20.989
- I let my shmeckel
do the thinking.

1:04:20.991 --> 1:04:22.357
- Okay, can you
just get off me now?

1:04:22.359 --> 1:04:23.458
Yeah.

1:04:23.460 --> 1:04:24.359
Thank you.

1:04:28.899 --> 1:04:30.165
- Jared, you know,

1:04:30.167 --> 1:04:33.001
Kate threw herself at
Rico all day yesterday

1:04:33.003 --> 1:04:36.238
and Rico rejected her
out of loyalty to you.

1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:37.439
- How do you know that?

1:04:38.275 --> 1:04:39.274
- Kate told me.

1:04:46.283 --> 1:04:47.349
- I am also sorry.

1:04:48.986 --> 1:04:50.919
I put my shmeckel in Kate too.

1:04:54.291 --> 1:04:55.390
- You, I get.

1:04:56.927 --> 1:04:57.626
But you?

1:04:59.062 --> 1:05:02.030
Why would she hook up
with you and not me?

1:05:02.032 --> 1:05:04.633
- Because you are not
worthy of her love.

1:05:04.635 --> 1:05:06.067
- Oh, thanks.

1:05:06.069 --> 1:05:08.236
- Well, that's what
you believe, isn't it?

1:05:08.238 --> 1:05:10.071
- No, it's not.

1:05:10.073 --> 1:05:11.172
- Yes it is.

1:05:12.242 --> 1:05:13.308
You're just like me.

1:05:14.244 --> 1:05:16.077
I don't love myself either.

1:05:16.079 --> 1:05:18.313
- Enough!

1:05:18.314 --> 1:05:20.548
You both believe some
bogus story in your heads.

1:05:20.550 --> 1:05:22.250
You don't have enough money.

1:05:22.252 --> 1:05:23.919
You don't have enough dick.

1:05:23.921 --> 1:05:25.253
Bullshit!

1:05:25.255 --> 1:05:27.322
You're both kick-ass dudes.

1:05:27.324 --> 1:05:28.623
Believe that!

1:05:28.625 --> 1:05:30.358
- Stimmt!

1:05:30.360 --> 1:05:31.393
- Stimmt!

1:05:31.395 --> 1:05:32.294
- Stimmt!

1:05:39.469 --> 1:05:42.070
- Did you really not know
that he had feelings for you?

1:05:42.072 --> 1:05:43.204
- No, I didn't.

1:05:44.708 --> 1:05:46.141
I mean, maybe I did.

1:05:46.143 --> 1:05:48.109
I just didn't wanna let
myself think about it

1:05:48.111 --> 1:05:50.946
because I didn't want to scare
off the friendship, you know?

1:05:51.581 --> 1:05:54.249
It sucks because I adore Jared.

1:05:54.251 --> 1:05:55.583
I really, really do.

1:05:55.585 --> 1:05:57.352
- If you don't mind my asking,

1:05:58.255 --> 1:06:00.322
what's wrong with
him, he seems great?

1:06:02.592 --> 1:06:05.427
(somber music)

1:06:17.007 --> 1:06:21.309
(people speaking
in German on TV)

1:06:21.311 --> 1:06:25.280
(woman sexually moaning on TV)

1:06:25.282 --> 1:06:27.615
(laughing)

1:06:28.752 --> 1:06:30.352
- Have you seen my
cellphone charger?

1:06:30.354 --> 1:06:31.619
I can't seem to find it.

1:06:34.491 --> 1:06:35.390
Oh!

1:06:37.027 --> 1:06:38.226
Oh, honey.

1:06:39.463 --> 1:06:42.063
(speaking German)

1:06:42.065 --> 1:06:42.998
What?

1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:45.133
- It means I wanna fuck you.

1:06:45.135 --> 1:06:46.167
- Fuck me, Lenny!

1:06:46.169 --> 1:06:47.435
Fuck me!

1:06:47.437 --> 1:06:49.671
- [Maggie On Phone] Mom!
Dad! What the hell?!

1:06:49.673 --> 1:06:53.074
- Oh crap, I butt
Skyped the kids.

1:06:53.076 --> 1:06:55.377
(laughing)

1:07:01.451 --> 1:07:04.519
- Hey, man, can we get
in on your dick workout?

1:07:04.521 --> 1:07:06.121
Felix said he tried it once

1:07:06.123 --> 1:07:07.655
and his dick is already
a little bit bigger.

1:07:07.657 --> 1:07:08.556
- Did he?

1:07:09.693 --> 1:07:11.059
- [Rico] Yeah, can
we do it with you?

1:07:11.061 --> 1:07:11.760
- Why?

1:07:16.700 --> 1:07:18.400
You guys already have big dicks.

1:07:18.402 --> 1:07:19.367
- Huh?

1:07:21.505 --> 1:07:22.938
No they're not.

1:07:22.939 --> 1:07:24.372
- Wait, you guys think
you have small dicks?

1:07:27.411 --> 1:07:29.310
- Let's work out.

1:07:29.312 --> 1:07:31.346
- [Barry] Thumb
and your forefinger

1:07:31.348 --> 1:07:33.448
and put it on the
base of your penis.

1:07:33.450 --> 1:07:34.783
Then with your other hand--

1:07:34.785 --> 1:07:36.084
- Wow!

1:07:36.086 --> 1:07:38.386
My cock looks bigger already.

1:07:38.388 --> 1:07:40.355
- Yeah, I can see
that from here.

1:07:40.357 --> 1:07:42.223
- Probably just placebo affect.

1:07:42.225 --> 1:07:43.491
I've been doing this
workout for three months

1:07:43.493 --> 1:07:45.527
and it's only a little bigger.

1:07:46.663 --> 1:07:48.463
- Does he know about
the finger trick?

1:07:48.465 --> 1:07:49.664
- You know about
the finger trick?

1:07:49.666 --> 1:07:51.433
- No, what finger trick?

1:07:51.435 --> 1:07:53.468
- You know your dick?

1:07:53.470 --> 1:07:55.170
- Yeah.

1:07:55.172 --> 1:07:57.639
- You know how it gets hard
when you're about to have sex?

1:07:57.641 --> 1:07:59.207
- I'm familiar with
an erection, Darren.

1:07:59.209 --> 1:08:02.510
- You know how you stick
it in a girl's pussy?

1:08:02.512 --> 1:08:03.545
- I know what sex
is Darren, yes.

1:08:03.547 --> 1:08:05.513
What's the finger trick?

1:08:05.515 --> 1:08:08.383
- The whole time
you're having sex,

1:08:08.385 --> 1:08:10.752
rub her clit with your finger.

1:08:11.855 --> 1:08:13.588
She'll go crazy.

1:08:15.258 --> 1:08:17.425
Trust me on this one.

1:08:17.427 --> 1:08:18.560
- Wait,

1:08:18.562 --> 1:08:20.128
really?

1:08:20.130 --> 1:08:21.162
Do you do that too?

1:08:22.499 --> 1:08:24.165
- Also, man,

1:08:24.167 --> 1:08:26.468
gotta get rid of that bush.

1:08:26.470 --> 1:08:31.372
Your long pubs are dangling
in front of your cock.

1:08:31.374 --> 1:08:33.374
See how we shaved?

1:08:33.376 --> 1:08:35.210
It makes our cocks look bigger.

1:08:43.253 --> 1:08:44.752
- Don't worry, bro,

1:08:44.754 --> 1:08:46.754
Rico is a pro.

1:08:46.756 --> 1:08:48.156
Trust me.

1:08:49.259 --> 1:08:50.792
Hey, there you are.

1:08:52.395 --> 1:08:54.195
He's got a dick!

1:08:54.197 --> 1:08:55.597
He's got a dick!

1:08:56.533 --> 1:08:58.399
He's got a dick!

1:08:58.401 --> 1:08:59.234
- [Rico] Yeah!

1:08:59.236 --> 1:09:00.568
- What is happening?

1:09:02.239 --> 1:09:03.371
- Love yourself, bro.

1:09:10.881 --> 1:09:11.779
- Yep,

1:09:12.649 --> 1:09:14.282
that's my dick.

1:09:14.284 --> 1:09:15.750
That's what I'm working with.

1:09:15.752 --> 1:09:17.519
- Jared, why?

1:09:17.521 --> 1:09:19.287
- Guys, can you
give us a minute?

1:09:19.289 --> 1:09:20.522
- [Darren] For sure.

1:09:20.524 --> 1:09:21.523
- Get out!

1:09:21.525 --> 1:09:22.357
Go!

1:09:22.359 --> 1:09:23.258
- Oh.

1:09:23.860 --> 1:09:25.260
- That was so

1:09:27.430 --> 1:09:28.329
great.

1:09:34.738 --> 1:09:37.539
(dramatic music)

1:09:41.912 --> 1:09:42.844
- Jared, I--

1:09:42.846 --> 1:09:44.746
- Kate, I'm in love with you.

1:09:46.583 --> 1:09:47.649
I should've told
you sooner, but--

1:09:47.651 --> 1:09:48.550
- Why didn't you?

1:09:49.920 --> 1:09:50.818
- I was scared.

1:09:52.322 --> 1:09:53.221
Afraid.

1:09:54.558 --> 1:09:56.257
In my mind,

1:09:56.259 --> 1:09:57.792
I'm not good enough for you.

1:09:59.262 --> 1:10:01.596
I'm not Randy or Rico.

1:10:01.598 --> 1:10:03.398
I mean, look at me.

1:10:05.569 --> 1:10:07.235
Look.

1:10:07.237 --> 1:10:09.671
- Jared, the size of your
penis doesn't matter.

1:10:11.708 --> 1:10:14.409
I care so much about you.

1:10:17.314 --> 1:10:20.582
But I can't change
the way that I feel.

1:10:22.586 --> 1:10:24.652
I really hope we can
still be friends.

1:10:30.527 --> 1:10:31.626
- Yeah,

1:10:32.495 --> 1:10:33.861
I'm sorry,

1:10:33.863 --> 1:10:35.296
but I can't do that.

1:10:37.901 --> 1:10:38.800
I can't.

1:10:40.870 --> 1:10:44.839
I can't be around you
and be your friend.

1:10:44.841 --> 1:10:47.642
(somber music)

1:11:19.809 --> 1:11:20.708
- Fuck him.

1:11:33.523 --> 1:11:34.456
- Annabelle?

1:11:34.457 --> 1:11:35.390
I have something I
have to tell you.

1:11:38.662 --> 1:11:39.627
When we're having sex,

1:11:41.965 --> 1:11:43.698
I wasn't thinking about you.

1:11:47.404 --> 1:11:48.069
- That's okay.

1:11:49.939 --> 1:11:51.706
I wasn't thinking
about you either.

1:11:54.644 --> 1:11:57.578
- You weren't?
(laughing)

1:11:57.580 --> 1:11:59.380
Who were you thinking about?

1:12:00.517 --> 1:12:02.617
(sighing)

1:12:02.619 --> 1:12:03.518
- The Captain.

1:12:05.655 --> 1:12:06.621
- The Captain?!

1:12:08.758 --> 1:12:09.590
- I was thinking,

1:12:09.592 --> 1:12:10.692
I was imagining him

1:12:12.062 --> 1:12:13.695
fucking me against the big
steering wheel of his ship.

1:12:13.697 --> 1:12:14.696
(gasping)

1:12:14.698 --> 1:12:15.596
- Annabelle!

1:12:20.670 --> 1:12:22.603
You've got a dirty mind.

1:12:22.605 --> 1:12:24.706
(giggling)

1:12:26.743 --> 1:12:29.110
You wanna be fucked
by the Captain, huh?

1:12:31.481 --> 1:12:32.781
- I do.

1:12:32.782 --> 1:12:34.082
- Well, guten morgen fraulein.

1:12:34.084 --> 1:12:36.617
(laughing)

1:12:36.619 --> 1:12:39.020
(sexual moaning)

1:12:39.022 --> 1:12:42.090
(yelling in German)

1:12:42.892 --> 1:12:44.692
(laughing)

1:12:44.694 --> 1:12:46.627
Annabelle, I am trying
to stay in character.

1:12:46.629 --> 1:12:47.862
- I'm sorry.

1:12:47.864 --> 1:12:48.763
I'm sorry.

1:12:49.766 --> 1:12:51.499
Fuck me, Captain, fuck me!

1:12:53.703 --> 1:12:56.104
(moaning)

1:12:56.106 --> 1:12:58.072
Full steam ahead!

1:13:00.410 --> 1:13:02.944
(pleasant music)

1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:06.647
- Preston, I really
fucked up your shit.

1:13:06.649 --> 1:13:07.915
I wanna make it up to you.

1:13:07.917 --> 1:13:10.918
I'm gonna help you do
the perfect proposal.

1:13:10.920 --> 1:13:11.919
- Stimmt.

1:13:11.921 --> 1:13:13.554
- Stimmt.

1:13:13.556 --> 1:13:14.856
- Stimmt.

1:13:14.858 --> 1:13:16.624
- Stimmt?

1:13:16.626 --> 1:13:19.060
(upbeat music)

1:13:21.698 --> 1:13:23.765
- What's going on?

1:13:23.767 --> 1:13:24.699
- Nothing.

1:13:24.701 --> 1:13:26.033
Just give me a minute here.

1:13:26.035 --> 1:13:28.903
(upbeat music)

1:14:06.709 --> 1:14:07.608
Sandra?

1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:11.779
I've...

1:14:14.784 --> 1:14:17.885
(clearing throat)

1:14:21.157 --> 1:14:22.824
(sighing)

1:14:22.826 --> 1:14:25.927
I've been planning this
moment since our first date.

1:14:31.134 --> 1:14:32.033
But you're right.

1:14:34.237 --> 1:14:35.536
This doesn't work.

1:14:37.841 --> 1:14:40.675
(somber music)

1:14:43.613 --> 1:14:45.213
- Preston, is Sandra coming?

1:14:45.215 --> 1:14:46.113
We're ready!

1:14:47.884 --> 1:14:49.517
- She's not coming.

1:14:49.519 --> 1:14:50.651
I called it off.

1:14:50.653 --> 1:14:52.487
- You serious, bro?

1:14:52.489 --> 1:14:53.688
What happened?

1:14:53.690 --> 1:14:55.056
- You know,

1:14:55.058 --> 1:14:57.859
I deserve someone
who loves me for me.

1:14:57.861 --> 1:14:58.826
She's not the one.

1:14:59.629 --> 1:15:00.528
- Stimmt.

1:15:02.031 --> 1:15:03.865
- Stimmt.

1:15:03.867 --> 1:15:05.733
- [Rico] Stimmt.

1:15:05.735 --> 1:15:06.968
- Do you love yourself?

1:15:09.138 --> 1:15:10.805
- I'm working on it.

1:15:10.807 --> 1:15:13.641
- Only when you truly love
yourself can you love another.

1:15:13.643 --> 1:15:16.043
- I'm sorry, Captain,
I have to interrupt.

1:15:16.045 --> 1:15:17.912
Do you love yourself?

1:15:17.914 --> 1:15:18.813
- What?

1:15:19.816 --> 1:15:21.048
- Do you love yourself?

1:15:21.951 --> 1:15:23.284
- Yeah, of course.

1:15:23.286 --> 1:15:24.952
- Then you can love another too.

1:15:26.990 --> 1:15:28.523
- I did.

1:15:28.525 --> 1:15:29.223
My Christine.

1:15:30.527 --> 1:15:32.560
- I mean another
besides Christine.

1:15:32.562 --> 1:15:34.595
It doesn't disrespect Christine

1:15:34.597 --> 1:15:36.964
or take anything away
from your love for her.

1:15:36.966 --> 1:15:38.232
- She was my one true love.

1:15:40.537 --> 1:15:41.969
- I know she was, Captain,

1:15:41.971 --> 1:15:44.005
but I want you to
experience love again

1:15:45.208 --> 1:15:47.041
and the only that's
going to happen

1:15:47.043 --> 1:15:48.876
is if you let Christine go.

1:15:50.580 --> 1:15:51.879
You have to let her go.

1:15:53.850 --> 1:15:55.783
- [Preston] Stimmt.

1:15:55.785 --> 1:15:57.218
- [Darren] Stimmt.

1:15:57.220 --> 1:15:58.786
- [Rico] Stimmt.

1:15:58.788 --> 1:16:00.922
- [Felix] Stimmt.

1:16:00.924 --> 1:16:03.691
(dramatic music)

1:16:17.840 --> 1:16:19.106
- What the hell is going on?

1:16:21.210 --> 1:16:22.877
- I'm letting go.

1:16:30.286 --> 1:16:33.087
(dramatic music)

1:17:19.369 --> 1:17:22.203
(dramatic music)

1:17:32.115 --> 1:17:34.281
(crying)

1:18:07.984 --> 1:18:10.985
(dramatic music)

1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:25.066
- The boy too.

1:18:27.336 --> 1:18:29.904
He's not still a baby
because of his mother.

1:18:31.007 --> 1:18:33.040
He's still a baby
because of you.

1:18:34.210 --> 1:18:36.277
He'll never become a man
until you let him go.

1:18:40.883 --> 1:18:43.017
I didn't mean right this second.

1:18:43.019 --> 1:18:45.186
- No, no, you're right.

1:18:48.825 --> 1:18:51.492
He must become a man
on his own, yeah?

1:18:52.295 --> 1:18:53.194
Goodbye, son.

1:18:55.364 --> 1:18:56.897
- Goodbye, Papa.

1:18:56.899 --> 1:18:59.734
(pleasant music)

1:19:19.055 --> 1:19:20.387
- Hey.

1:19:20.389 --> 1:19:22.056
- Hey.

1:19:22.058 --> 1:19:23.424
- Are you driving
back to the city?

1:19:23.426 --> 1:19:24.291
- Yeah.

1:19:25.895 --> 1:19:26.927
- Can I get a ride?

1:19:29.031 --> 1:19:30.097
- Sandra, I like you

1:19:31.200 --> 1:19:34.068
and not just as a friend
but more than that.

1:19:36.172 --> 1:19:37.305
- What're you doing?

1:19:37.306 --> 1:19:38.439
- Being a man, telling
you how I feel.

1:19:40.143 --> 1:19:41.308
There's more to being a man

1:19:41.310 --> 1:19:43.077
than telling a
women how you feel.

1:19:43.079 --> 1:19:44.345
There's showing her too.

1:19:45.448 --> 1:19:48.249
(pleasant music)

1:19:57.126 --> 1:19:59.960
(gasping)

1:19:59.962 --> 1:20:02.196
(moaning)

1:20:05.301 --> 1:20:06.867
What're you doing?

1:20:06.869 --> 1:20:08.169
- Finger trick.

1:20:08.171 --> 1:20:08.969
- What?

1:20:08.971 --> 1:20:09.870
- Watch.

1:20:11.073 --> 1:20:13.974
(moaning)

1:20:13.976 --> 1:20:15.042
- Oh my God!

1:20:16.145 --> 1:20:18.379
(moaning)

1:20:20.183 --> 1:20:21.081
Oh my God.

1:20:25.154 --> 1:20:27.221
(sexual moaning)

1:20:29.492 --> 1:20:31.342
- No way.

1:20:31.343 --> 1:20:33.193
Is Jared finally
banging out Kate?

1:20:33.196 --> 1:20:34.528
- I gotta see this.

1:20:34.530 --> 1:20:35.429
- Me too!

1:20:37.166 --> 1:20:39.967
(sexual moaning)

1:20:44.006 --> 1:20:44.839
- What the?

1:20:44.841 --> 1:20:45.506
- Sandra?

1:20:45.508 --> 1:20:47.007
- Jared!

1:20:47.009 --> 1:20:48.175
(squealing)

1:20:48.177 --> 1:20:49.877
- Hells to the yeah!

1:20:51.113 --> 1:20:51.946
(moaning)

1:20:51.948 --> 1:20:53.314
- I'm gonna cum.

1:20:56.085 --> 1:20:58.853
(Sandra moaning)

1:21:00.122 --> 1:21:02.857
(upbeat music)

1:21:16.973 --> 1:21:17.905
- [Jared] Sure you
don't wanna stay

1:21:17.907 --> 1:21:19.240
and surf in the backyard?

1:21:19.242 --> 1:21:20.274
(Sandra giggling)

1:21:20.276 --> 1:21:21.331
- [Sandra] I think I'll pass.

1:21:21.332 --> 1:21:22.387
- [Jared] All right
but you're missing out

1:21:22.388 --> 1:21:23.443
on some killer waves back there.

1:21:23.446 --> 1:21:24.345
- Hey.

1:21:26.015 --> 1:21:28.515
Any chance I could hitch a
ride back to Williamsburg?

1:21:28.517 --> 1:21:30.017
- Yeah, sure.

1:21:30.019 --> 1:21:32.419
¶ Going back to Williamsburg ¶

1:21:32.421 --> 1:21:35.189
¶ Williamsburg ¶

1:21:35.191 --> 1:21:36.290
Oh, stupid.

1:21:36.292 --> 1:21:37.892
- No, that was awesome.

1:21:37.894 --> 1:21:39.894
¶ Going back to Williamsburg ¶

1:21:39.896 --> 1:21:41.262

1:21:42.231 --> 1:21:47.167
¶ Going back to Williamsburg ¶

1:21:47.403 --> 1:21:48.502
- Kate?

1:21:48.504 --> 1:21:49.970
- Preston?

1:21:49.972 --> 1:21:51.338
- Yeah!

1:21:51.340 --> 1:21:52.940
Hells to the yeah!

1:21:52.942 --> 1:21:55.309
(laughing)

1:21:55.311 --> 1:21:56.510
- Pelton!

1:21:56.512 --> 1:21:57.378
Pelton!

1:21:58.381 --> 1:21:59.580
You forgot your hat.

1:21:59.582 --> 1:22:01.048
- That's not my hat.

1:22:01.050 --> 1:22:01.916
- Look inside.

1:22:05.454 --> 1:22:06.987
- What?

1:22:06.989 --> 1:22:08.155
Why?

1:22:08.157 --> 1:22:09.056
- For the bakery.

1:22:11.394 --> 1:22:13.060
- I don't know what to say.

1:22:13.996 --> 1:22:16.964
- In Germany we say, "bis bald."

1:22:18.301 --> 1:22:20.567
It means, "see you soon."

1:22:22.038 --> 1:22:23.103
- Bis bald.

1:22:28.311 --> 1:22:31.946
- The Captain is my captain
and always will be my captain!

1:22:31.948 --> 1:22:33.547
(horn honking)

1:22:33.549 --> 1:22:36.383
