WEBVTT

00:50.920 --> 00:52.400
Good morning.

00:52.487 --> 00:54.402
Are you here
for meditation hour?

00:54.489 --> 00:56.273
It's, uh, over at the chaitya.

01:03.411 --> 01:05.065
Wait!

01:21.081 --> 01:22.082
Nobody move!

01:24.171 --> 01:25.433
Hey! Hey!

01:34.964 --> 01:36.618
Hey! Hey! Stop it!

01:38.010 --> 01:39.142
Stop it!

01:52.155 --> 01:53.069
Move.

02:04.515 --> 02:05.908
No.

02:05.995 --> 02:06.996
Open your eyes.

02:08.563 --> 02:09.738
Open your eyes!

02:44.816 --> 02:46.035
You're, uh,
getting low on sugar.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.297
Did you check above the, uh--

02:47.384 --> 02:48.690
Yeah, that left
cabinet next to the sink.

02:48.777 --> 02:50.561
Yeah.

02:50.648 --> 02:51.910
I don't know why they
bother having us come in

02:51.997 --> 02:53.521
on a half day, you know.

02:53.608 --> 02:56.176
The court's closed,
and my clerk already

02:56.263 --> 02:57.612
flew home this morning.

02:57.699 --> 02:58.961
The day before Thanksgiving
is the worst

02:59.048 --> 03:00.832
travel day of the year.

03:00.919 --> 03:02.225
I'd rather pull my face off

03:02.312 --> 03:03.531
than be anywhere near
an airport.

03:03.618 --> 03:05.010
Mm-hmm.

03:05.097 --> 03:06.229
So what are your plans
for tomorrow?

03:06.316 --> 03:07.665
Mm.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.711
Claire drove my mom down
to D.C. for the weekend

03:09.798 --> 03:12.061
to be with my cousin,
so I'll probably just,

03:12.148 --> 03:15.282
I don't know,
microwave a turkey and wing it.

03:17.588 --> 03:19.068
You?

03:19.155 --> 03:21.679
Oh, my folks always
do a thing in Long Island.

03:21.766 --> 03:25.379
Yeah, it's really low key,
so if you wanted to--

03:25.466 --> 03:26.510
yeah.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.164
Forget that.

03:28.251 --> 03:29.383
Forget all about that.

03:29.470 --> 03:30.949
You know what's
even more low key?

03:31.036 --> 03:32.951
Is you and me here.

03:33.038 --> 03:35.345
We could hang out
all day and order in,

03:35.432 --> 03:38.043
and nobody
has to stuff a turkey.

03:38.130 --> 03:39.219
Sure.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.743
That could work.

03:41.830 --> 03:43.919
It could or it will?

03:44.006 --> 03:46.791
You want me to commit,
like, right now?

03:46.878 --> 03:48.706
Well, it's tomorrow, Remy.

03:48.793 --> 03:51.840
It's not like I'm asking you
to plan our summer vacation.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.798
I like low key.

03:53.885 --> 03:55.844
Sounds like a plan.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.759
Good.

03:57.846 --> 04:01.893
Mama, take this badge
off of me.

04:01.980 --> 04:04.592
Isobel, hey.

04:04.679 --> 04:06.333
Yeah.

04:06.420 --> 04:07.595
No half-days for me.

04:09.771 --> 04:12.252
Yeah, on my way.

04:20.477 --> 04:23.045
I was told seven dead,
but I only see six bodies.

04:23.132 --> 04:25.047
There's another dead monk
outside the admin office.

04:25.134 --> 04:26.614
Figure he got it first,

04:26.701 --> 04:28.224
and then the shooter
came in here.

04:29.965 --> 04:31.227
These are from
a 9-millimeter.

04:31.314 --> 04:32.924
Kinda surprising.

04:33.011 --> 04:35.318
Most mass shooters use
AR-15-style semiautomatics.

04:35.405 --> 04:36.885
Not always.

04:36.972 --> 04:40.323
Dirtbag at Virginia Tech
used two pistols, as I recall.

04:40.410 --> 04:44.022
So this guy was by the altar,
the shooter entered,

04:44.109 --> 04:47.896
she tried to make a run
for it, didn't make it.

04:47.983 --> 04:52.640
But these men, the monks,
didn't stand a chance.

04:52.727 --> 04:54.119
Where'd you find the survivor?

04:54.206 --> 04:55.599
She was a dancer here,

04:55.686 --> 04:58.428
rehearsing
for a special ceremony.

04:58.515 --> 05:02.693
What kind of psycho goes
after monks and Buddhists?

05:02.780 --> 05:05.000
People only here
for prayer and reflection.

05:06.871 --> 05:08.308
Remy.

05:08.395 --> 05:09.918
Looks like the shooter
locked everyone inside

05:10.005 --> 05:11.659
before opening fire.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.661
The dancers were trying
to escape when they were shot,

05:13.748 --> 05:15.532
and the one who survived
had to play dead.

05:15.619 --> 05:18.709
Make sure ERT sends the
padlock to the lab for prints.

05:18.796 --> 05:21.059
If we get lucky, the killer
wasn't wearing gloves.

05:21.146 --> 05:23.018
Guys, I found this
in the hallway

05:23.105 --> 05:24.933
outside the admin office.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.588
I doubt the shooter
meant to leave it behind.

05:27.675 --> 05:30.025
So he scouted the temple
beforehand and drew a map.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.722
This attack was planned.

05:31.809 --> 05:34.290
Guys, the survivor's
daughter just arrived.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.423
She can help her mom translate.

05:41.079 --> 05:43.038
Did your mom get
a good look at the shooter?

05:56.225 --> 05:57.966
She says it all
happened too fast,

05:58.053 --> 06:00.838
but they were using her phone
to record the rehearsal.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.757
What the hell is that?

06:06.844 --> 06:09.586
It looks like someone's
outside the door.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.980
We don't get a great
look at his face.

06:12.067 --> 06:14.374
It'd be hard
to ID him from this.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.637
Looks like he's wearing one
of those plastic face shields.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.508
They prevent
facial rec software.

06:18.595 --> 06:20.684
Hey, guys, I got something.

06:20.771 --> 06:22.773
On Monday, someone shot
and killed a priest

06:22.860 --> 06:24.993
outside a Catholic church
six miles from here.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.647
Suspect still at large.

06:26.734 --> 06:28.126
Hate Crimes thinks
this could be related.

06:28.213 --> 06:29.780
Is someone targeting
religious places?

06:29.867 --> 06:30.999
Could be triggered
by the upcoming holidays,

06:31.086 --> 06:32.479
Hanukkah, Christmas.

06:32.566 --> 06:34.045
They're alerting
all churches, temples,

06:34.132 --> 06:35.786
mosques in a 30-mile radius.

06:35.873 --> 06:37.092
Okay, Hana,
you're on that video,

06:37.179 --> 06:38.310
but I also need you
to check the web

06:38.398 --> 06:40.225
for any posts or online chatter

06:40.312 --> 06:41.879
in case our shooter
advertises plans.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.446
Copy that.

06:43.533 --> 06:44.969
You know, we still need
to notify the next of kin.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.623
Get intel on the victims.
- I'll help you with that.

06:46.710 --> 06:49.409
Good.

06:49.496 --> 06:50.627
Let's go see my friend
at Hate Crimes

06:50.714 --> 06:51.933
before he leaves
for the holiday.

06:52.020 --> 06:55.023
Find out about
this dead priest.

06:55.110 --> 06:58.592
We're sorry for your loss.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.420
Now, you're listed
as an emergency contact

07:00.507 --> 07:01.638
for two of the victims,

07:01.725 --> 07:04.728
but you're not related
to them by blood.

07:04.815 --> 07:06.426
No.

07:06.513 --> 07:10.125
Master Prem and Master Ram
don't have any family here.

07:10.212 --> 07:12.562
They were brothers.

07:12.649 --> 07:13.998
They only had each other.

07:16.348 --> 07:18.046
And what can you
tell us about them?

07:18.133 --> 07:21.528
Well,
they were from Thailand.

07:23.268 --> 07:25.880
Small village by the sea.

07:25.967 --> 07:28.926
They came here
30, 40 years ago.

07:30.145 --> 07:34.236
I volunteered
at the temple since 2005.

07:34.323 --> 07:38.327
We were like family.

07:38.414 --> 07:40.068
Sorry.

07:43.288 --> 07:45.508
Can you think of anyone

07:45.595 --> 07:47.728
who would want to target
your community?

07:47.815 --> 07:50.992
Who would want
to murder Buddhists?

07:51.079 --> 07:53.734
I know everyone
who attends the temple,

07:53.821 --> 07:58.826
even the people who only
visit for special occasions.

07:58.913 --> 08:01.306
I have to cancel
the New Moon Festival.

08:01.393 --> 08:03.221
- When was that supposed to be?
- Today.

08:03.308 --> 08:05.397
That's why the temple
was open so early.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.748
Visiting hours
usually begin at noon.

08:07.835 --> 08:10.054
On a regular day,
who's usually here

08:10.141 --> 08:11.534
that early in the morning?

08:11.621 --> 08:13.971
Only the monks.

08:14.058 --> 08:17.061
They have sleeping quarters
there at the temple.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.064
If he scoped the place out,

08:20.151 --> 08:22.066
he probably didn't expect
anyone to be there.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.720
Yeah.

08:23.807 --> 08:25.635
What do the monks
usually do in the morning

08:25.722 --> 08:27.289
before you open for visitors?

08:27.376 --> 08:29.900
They usually begin
the day in the office,

08:29.987 --> 08:34.601
then prayer and meditation,
then rest,

08:34.688 --> 08:36.559
but not today.

08:36.646 --> 08:40.128
Why would someone
do this to us?

08:40.215 --> 08:41.782
We're not hurting anybody.

08:53.315 --> 08:54.403
Thanks, Phil.

08:54.490 --> 08:56.057
Appreciate you, man.

08:56.144 --> 08:57.754
Father Phinn Ruckle.

08:57.841 --> 08:59.626
Minding his own business
last Monday morning when

08:59.713 --> 09:00.844
he was shot on the street.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.411
Weapon was a 9-mil.

09:02.498 --> 09:03.978
Witness across the street
says she saw the perp

09:04.065 --> 09:05.762
waiting outside the church.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.764
As soon as the father
comes out, he attacks him.

09:07.851 --> 09:09.331
Levels him with a
sucker punch to the head,

09:09.418 --> 09:10.332
starts kicking him.

09:10.419 --> 09:11.986
Then he pulls out his gun

09:12.073 --> 09:14.249
and shoots him three times,
point blank.

09:14.336 --> 09:15.946
Any description
on the shooter?

09:16.033 --> 09:17.861
She said it was a guy
in a hoodie, medium build.

09:17.948 --> 09:19.559
Didn't see his face.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.386
By the way
he ran off after her,

09:21.473 --> 09:22.997
she thought it could
possibly be a kid.

09:23.084 --> 09:24.433
So he was stalking him?

09:24.520 --> 09:26.304
Pretty much the same MO
for our guy.

09:26.391 --> 09:29.177
Forensics got touch DNA
off the padlock at the temple.

09:29.264 --> 09:30.526
No hits in the system,

09:30.613 --> 09:32.223
but they used it
to come up with a sketch.

09:32.310 --> 09:33.877
White male, dark hair.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.444
Could this be him?

09:35.531 --> 09:37.185
I don't know.

09:37.272 --> 09:39.361
Hit me on Air Drop with that,
I'll send it to my witness.

09:39.448 --> 09:41.406
At least it's a start.

09:41.493 --> 09:42.799
Yeah.

09:44.105 --> 09:46.281
You want to put a BOLO out
based on a phenotype sketch?

09:46.368 --> 09:47.630
Yeah, I do.

09:47.717 --> 09:48.979
<i>But you can't
accurately predict</i>

09:49.066 --> 09:50.590
physical characteristics
off of DNA.

09:50.677 --> 09:53.549
It's like trying to predict IQ
off of head size.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.203
We all remember
how a bad sketch

09:55.290 --> 09:57.292
derailed the D.C. sniper case.
- Yeah. We do.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.381
But right now,
this is all we got.

09:59.468 --> 10:00.687
<i>Well, not necessarily.</i>

10:00.774 --> 10:02.863
<i>I know our unsub's height.</i>

10:02.950 --> 10:04.778
<i>Well, I used a still
from the video image</i>

10:04.865 --> 10:06.867
and I measured the length
of the shadow.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.999
Now, based on the timestamp
from the video,

10:09.086 --> 10:11.219
the exact location
of the sun at that time,

10:11.306 --> 10:12.786
<i>I figured he's 5'11".</i>

10:12.873 --> 10:14.352
Great--put it
on the description

10:14.439 --> 10:15.745
<i>and add it to the wire.</i>

10:15.832 --> 10:18.052
We need something
to get the tip line ringing.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.542
Have a good Thanksgiving, everyone.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.674
- You too.
- See you.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.241
Thank you.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.571
Hey. Hold on.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.486
Hey, hey, hey.

11:01.573 --> 11:03.488
What-what are you doing?

11:03.575 --> 11:06.578
I want you to see my face.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.189
The way he saw yours.

11:10.321 --> 11:12.976
Who are you?

11:13.063 --> 11:14.412
- You remember, don't you?
- Who? Who are you?

11:14.499 --> 11:15.805
What do you want?

11:15.892 --> 11:17.067
What happens when you bash
your baby's brain

11:17.154 --> 11:18.329
against a rock.

11:18.416 --> 11:20.027
No!

11:21.898 --> 11:23.291
You almost got away with it.

11:27.425 --> 11:29.950
Get your phone. Call 911.

11:30.037 --> 11:32.169
Hey! What are you doing?

11:32.256 --> 11:33.823
Hey, leave him alone!

11:33.910 --> 11:35.259
Hey, stop!

11:35.346 --> 11:36.521
I said stop!

11:39.350 --> 11:40.177
Hey, stop that guy!

11:44.921 --> 11:46.575
Oh! Get back!
- Oh, my God!

11:46.662 --> 11:48.011
Cover! Back there!

11:48.098 --> 11:49.752
Run!

12:02.678 --> 12:04.201
His name is
Arthit Anwar.

12:04.288 --> 12:05.550
Home address is
in the East Village.

12:05.637 --> 12:10.512
Anwar, that's a common
Thai surname, I believe.

12:10.599 --> 12:11.948
Still nothing that
links our fugitive

12:12.035 --> 12:13.515
to the murder of the priest.

12:13.602 --> 12:15.473
Right,
but the victim is Thai,

12:15.560 --> 12:17.388
like most of them
at the temple.

12:17.475 --> 12:19.303
He could be specifically
targeting Asian Americans.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.175
Well, whether religion
or race,

12:21.262 --> 12:22.829
hate crime is a hate crime.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.134
We got to stop this guy.

12:24.221 --> 12:26.571
Hopefully, this helps.

12:26.658 --> 12:27.921
Thank you.

12:29.966 --> 12:31.838
Victim's an Asian male?

12:31.925 --> 12:34.057
Yeah, a couple civilians
saw the attack in progress.

12:34.144 --> 12:36.059
One of them has
a concealed carry permit.

12:36.146 --> 12:38.148
Chased the perp
and fired at him.

12:38.235 --> 12:39.454
Think this is the same guy

12:39.541 --> 12:41.282
who shot up the temple
earlier today?

12:41.369 --> 12:43.327
It's looking that way,
and the timeline matches.

12:43.414 --> 12:46.069
It's about a half hour
from Mount Vernon to the city.

12:46.156 --> 12:47.375
Where can we find
this vigilante?

12:49.638 --> 12:50.552
Thank you.

12:52.684 --> 12:55.426
The guy you chased,
you see his face?

12:55.513 --> 12:57.515
No, like I told the cops,
it all happened so fast.

12:57.602 --> 12:59.953
We were running,
plus he had a mask on.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.215
Was it clear plastic?

13:01.302 --> 13:03.086
Yeah, kinda. I don't know.

13:03.173 --> 13:04.609
When am I getting my gun back?

13:04.696 --> 13:06.611
How about never?

13:06.698 --> 13:07.787
I have a permit.

13:07.874 --> 13:08.962
Well, then, you should know

13:09.049 --> 13:10.354
Central Park
is a no-carry zone.

13:10.441 --> 13:11.878
They passed the law
this summer.

13:11.965 --> 13:13.314
Yeah, and crap like this
happens all the time

13:13.401 --> 13:15.272
because people stand by
and do nothing.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.144
I saved a lot of lives today.

13:17.231 --> 13:18.667
Tell that
to the Juilliard girl.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.930
Your bullet just missed
her left lung.

13:21.017 --> 13:24.194
You know Asian hate crimes
have quadrupled this last year.

13:24.281 --> 13:25.761
You guys need to do your jobs.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.328
We are.

13:27.415 --> 13:28.808
You know, and it gets harder
when idiots like you

13:28.895 --> 13:30.592
try to play cops and robbers.

13:30.679 --> 13:31.593
Okay.

13:34.161 --> 13:35.466
That's the thanks I get?

13:38.469 --> 13:41.298
The bellhop next door
said he saw him run down

13:41.385 --> 13:43.779
this side of the street,
which means your cameras

13:43.866 --> 13:45.172
most likely caught him.

13:45.259 --> 13:46.477
I understand,
but our residents

13:46.564 --> 13:47.914
choose the Leckerbild
because we offer

13:48.001 --> 13:49.524
privacy and discretion.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.265
They don't like people knowing
their comings and goings.

13:51.352 --> 13:53.049
And I feel you, Carol.

13:53.136 --> 13:54.572
I don't want to get you
in trouble with your residents,

13:54.659 --> 13:56.009
all right?

13:56.096 --> 13:57.314
I live in a walk-up.

13:57.401 --> 13:59.273
I lived in a place like this,

13:59.360 --> 14:00.883
it would make my hours
a lot easier coming home

14:00.970 --> 14:03.320
to a friendly face like yours.

14:03.407 --> 14:04.495
Just one look, please?

14:06.584 --> 14:09.239
The camera's connected
to an app on here.

14:09.326 --> 14:10.371
What time are you looking for?

14:10.458 --> 14:12.503
Between 12:40 and 12:50.

14:16.812 --> 14:17.813
Ooh, right there.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.510
Hold on a second.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.077
Thank you.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.823
You are a boss.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.956
I hope you get some time off
this weekend.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.784
- Thank you. Hey, Ray?
- Yeah.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.786
ERT just ran a rapid test DNA
on the glove.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.527
Matches the padlock.
This is definitely our guy.

14:36.614 --> 14:38.921
All right, good,
because we just got plates.

14:39.008 --> 14:41.619
Camera caught this guy
jumping into a silver Camry.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.056
Nice work.

14:43.143 --> 14:44.579
Remy's just a few blocks away.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.711
Just wanted your team
to be the first to know

14:46.798 --> 14:49.105
we caught that kid who shot
the priest in Mount Vernon.

14:49.192 --> 14:51.673
- It was a kid?
<i>- Yep.</i>

14:51.760 --> 14:53.153
You run his DNA?

14:53.240 --> 14:54.719
<i>It wasn't a match
to your fugitive.</i>

14:54.806 --> 14:58.027
But he was known to local PD
for small time cash grabs.

14:58.114 --> 14:59.768
Guess he graduated to murder.

14:59.855 --> 15:02.466
All right.
Thanks for the update.

15:02.553 --> 15:05.034
So they arrested the priest
killer, it's not our guy.

15:05.121 --> 15:07.732
Seems like there was no
religious motive after all.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.821
Ray and Kristin just ID'd
the fugitive's getaway car.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.823
It's a silver Toyota Camry.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.390
They got the plates too.

15:13.477 --> 15:16.741
Belongs to a Doris Moore
of Rochester, New York,

15:16.828 --> 15:18.352
but she hasn't reported
the car stolen.

15:18.439 --> 15:19.788
Who else has access to it?

15:19.875 --> 15:21.398
I'm searching residents
in her area.

15:21.485 --> 15:23.139
She's married with no kids
to an Adam Moore.

15:23.226 --> 15:24.880
Hold on,
Adam's driver's license

15:24.967 --> 15:26.795
has him listed as 5'11".

15:26.882 --> 15:28.144
Moore could be our guy.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.885
But this guy's half Asian.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.626
Well, it means the sketch
was half wrong.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.628
I like to think
of it as half right.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.673
He's a chemistry teacher
at Rochester High.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.110
All right, well,
school's in session today,

15:37.197 --> 15:38.459
at least for
some of the day.

15:38.546 --> 15:39.416
I can contact the principal,
see if Adam

15:39.503 --> 15:40.809
called in a substitute
this morning.

15:40.896 --> 15:43.116
Can we ping his cell?

15:43.203 --> 15:44.682
I just tried.
Nothing yet.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.946
Let's get a hold of his wife.
Find out what she knows.

15:49.339 --> 15:51.167
As soon as you called
and said Adam wasn't in school,

15:51.254 --> 15:53.082
I came here.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.910
And when you woke up this
morning and Adam wasn't home,

15:54.997 --> 15:56.477
was there any concern at all?

15:56.564 --> 15:57.695
No.

15:57.782 --> 15:59.088
Sometimes Adam
goes to school early

15:59.175 --> 16:00.394
to see students one-on-one.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.396
Lately, if he's not there,
he's here.

16:02.483 --> 16:03.701
You mind if I look around?

16:05.790 --> 16:06.704
Fine.

16:09.098 --> 16:11.709
It has been so hard on Adam
seeing his dad

16:11.796 --> 16:14.451
suffer like this, and your
crazy accusations don't help.

16:14.538 --> 16:15.409
Do you think
your husband will try

16:15.496 --> 16:16.845
to get in touch
with his father?

16:16.932 --> 16:18.455
I think that if you
wait here long enough,

16:18.542 --> 16:20.240
Adam will walk through
that door and prove you wrong.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.375
I mean, Adam adores his dad,

16:25.462 --> 16:27.247
and they don't have
much time left together.

16:27.334 --> 16:29.379
Sorry to hear that.

16:29.466 --> 16:30.902
What is it that
he's suffering from?

16:30.990 --> 16:33.731
Lumbar disc disease.

16:33.818 --> 16:35.342
There's no cure.

16:35.429 --> 16:38.649
And with age, the chronic pain
has gotten unbearable.

16:38.736 --> 16:41.696
Maybe seeing his father
like this was too much for him,

16:41.783 --> 16:43.263
and he snapped.

16:44.873 --> 16:48.311
Adam appears to be
targeting Asian victims.

16:48.398 --> 16:49.965
Can you think of a reason
why that might be?

16:50.052 --> 16:51.271
No.

16:51.358 --> 16:54.404
Are you and your husband
Buddhist?

16:54.491 --> 16:56.624
No, Adam's mom was.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.974
She died years ago
when he was 15.

16:59.061 --> 17:01.281
She was from Vietnam,

17:01.368 --> 17:03.674
and we're still close
to that side of the family.

17:03.761 --> 17:06.590
It gives my father-in-law
comfort to have this here.

17:06.677 --> 17:08.244
A little token of his wife.

17:10.681 --> 17:12.814
Thank you for your time.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.647
I just--I just can't.

17:19.734 --> 17:21.040
I'm in shock.

17:21.127 --> 17:23.738
Adam's beloved around here.

17:23.825 --> 17:25.740
Senior class just voted him
Best Teacher of the Year,

17:25.827 --> 17:27.655
four years in a row.

17:27.742 --> 17:29.178
He's been cooking up
something a lot more dangerous

17:29.265 --> 17:31.267
than what he teaches,
I'll tell you that much.

17:31.354 --> 17:33.095
Did you know
he played hooky today?

17:33.182 --> 17:34.923
No, but he's been having
problems with his father,

17:35.010 --> 17:36.533
and the holidays,
and I just figured

17:36.620 --> 17:38.057
something was going on
with his family,

17:38.144 --> 17:39.841
so I called a sub in for him.

17:39.928 --> 17:42.887
Is the United Nations part
of Adam's chem curriculum?

17:42.974 --> 17:45.281
- No, why?
- I didn't think so.

17:45.368 --> 17:46.891
He visited their website
every day

17:46.978 --> 17:48.589
for the last two weeks.
Check it.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.808
It sounds strange,
but maybe he was doing

17:50.895 --> 17:55.030
some research into
some extracurricular project.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.466
Research, my ass.

17:56.553 --> 17:57.989
Okay, I'm looking up
their calendar of events.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.122
Not much is happening this week
besides a Model UN conference

18:00.209 --> 18:02.255
at one of their
off-sites in Manhattan.

18:02.342 --> 18:03.430
Wait a second.

18:03.517 --> 18:05.693
UN Ambassador Jennifer Wong

18:05.780 --> 18:07.434
is giving a speech there
this afternoon.

18:07.521 --> 18:09.218
She's Chinese American.

18:09.305 --> 18:10.915
Adam went after soft targets
at the temple.

18:11.002 --> 18:12.830
Maybe now he's going
after a hard target.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.528
High profile Asian.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.007
I'll tag Ray.
Get ahold of NYPD.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.792
Tell him we have a potential
active shooter situation.

18:17.879 --> 18:19.663
Everyone needs
to shelter in place.

18:19.750 --> 18:20.882
We have to lock down
that conference now.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.259
WE've sealed off
all the upper floors.

18:50.346 --> 18:51.565
Nothing yet.

18:51.652 --> 18:52.783
Just keep going,
and then please

18:52.870 --> 18:53.784
let me know once
it's all completed.

18:53.871 --> 18:55.612
Sure.

18:55.699 --> 18:57.223
We've swept almost all
the floors and rooms,

18:57.310 --> 18:58.572
no sign of Adam yet.

18:58.659 --> 18:59.660
Everyone's in a
shelter in place

18:59.747 --> 19:01.140
until we give the all-clear.

19:01.227 --> 19:02.880
Adam got into
a silver Camry, right?

19:02.967 --> 19:04.665
Yeah.

19:04.752 --> 19:06.188
Wait a second,
Adam was a chem teacher.

19:06.275 --> 19:07.885
He'd know how to make a bomb.

19:07.972 --> 19:09.757
I'm calling it in
to Bomb Squad.

19:09.844 --> 19:11.628
- Everybody back!
- Back!

19:11.715 --> 19:14.327
- Get back!
- Move, move, move!

19:17.112 --> 19:18.809
Somebody's in here.

19:24.859 --> 19:26.730
It's all right.
It's all right.

19:35.391 --> 19:36.958
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

19:37.045 --> 19:38.220
Am I being punked?
- It's okay.

19:38.307 --> 19:39.961
Take a couple of deep breaths.

19:40.048 --> 19:41.615
You do Model UN?

19:41.702 --> 19:43.399
You a student?

19:43.486 --> 19:45.096
Yeah, let me take
a wild guess.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.490
Rochester High, and one of
your teachers was Adam Moore?

19:47.577 --> 19:49.100
Damn, you're good.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.058
Okay, where are the cameras?

19:50.145 --> 19:51.712
You're punking me for sure.

19:51.799 --> 19:54.236
There'll be plenty of cameras
from CNN, not MTV.

19:54.323 --> 19:55.977
Your teacher is wanted
for murder.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.587
Tell us what happened here.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.415
Oh, my God.

19:59.502 --> 20:02.810
Um, so, a couple
of my classmates and I,

20:02.897 --> 20:06.553
we got the week off to attend
this Model UN thing here.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.033
I was walking up
when I saw Mr. Moore.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.253
At first, I thought
I was tripping,

20:11.340 --> 20:13.690
but then he pulled out
this gun,

20:13.777 --> 20:15.475
and I was really tripping.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.825
Okay, take deep breaths.
Deep breaths. It's okay.

20:17.912 --> 20:19.827
Rico.

20:19.914 --> 20:21.132
What happened next?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.743
He pulled the gun on me

20:22.830 --> 20:24.962
and made me get in the trunk,
and he took all my stuff.

20:25.049 --> 20:26.268
My phone, my keys.

20:26.355 --> 20:27.617
All right,
so what did he say?

20:27.704 --> 20:29.402
Did he tell you
where he was going?

20:29.489 --> 20:31.273
All he asked is where
I parked my car.

20:31.360 --> 20:34.276
I told him right over there.

20:34.363 --> 20:35.843
What kind of car
are you driving?

20:35.930 --> 20:37.671
It's a gold Chevy Malibu.

20:37.758 --> 20:40.500
Get the plates.
Put a BOLO out on the Chevy.

20:40.587 --> 20:43.024
Rico, did Mr. Moore know
you'd be here today?

20:43.111 --> 20:44.547
I don't know.

20:44.634 --> 20:46.636
Uh. Maybe.

20:46.723 --> 20:50.118
He doesn't do Model UN,
but he knows I do it.

20:50.205 --> 20:52.076
He's writing
my rec letters for college,

20:52.163 --> 20:54.601
so I gave him my résumé.

20:54.688 --> 20:56.516
Okay, you did great.
We're gonna call your parents.

20:56.603 --> 20:57.908
We're gonna get both of them
down here right away.

20:57.995 --> 21:00.694
Thank you.

21:00.781 --> 21:03.044
So Adam knows
we're onto him, right?

21:03.131 --> 21:04.263
He needs new wheels,
I get that part,

21:04.350 --> 21:05.264
but wouldn't it
have been easier

21:05.351 --> 21:06.743
to just carjack a stranger?

21:06.830 --> 21:09.920
He wanted Rico's
Chevy Malibu for a reason.

21:10.007 --> 21:12.096
We need to find out why.

21:17.014 --> 21:18.320
- Hey.
- How's it going, man?

21:24.631 --> 21:26.633
Well, better off that way.
Thank you.

21:35.729 --> 21:38.340
William Hunter?

21:38.427 --> 21:39.646
Do I know you?

21:39.733 --> 21:41.735
No.

21:41.822 --> 21:42.910
But I know you.

21:55.531 --> 21:56.271
Just got word
of a new victim.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.099
Maybe related to our case.

21:58.186 --> 22:00.014
Gunned down right in front
of his house in Westchester.

22:04.018 --> 22:05.715
An elderly white guy.

22:05.802 --> 22:07.804
This doesn't fit his pattern.
You sure it's Adam?

22:07.891 --> 22:09.458
Neighbors spotted a gold
Chevy Malibu fleeing the scene.

22:09.545 --> 22:10.633
Male driver behind the wheel.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.505
Same as the car
Rico told us he drives.

22:12.592 --> 22:14.071
Well, that's not all
Adam's been up to.

22:14.158 --> 22:15.769
Check this out.

22:15.856 --> 22:16.987
He has a return flight
booked to Amsterdam on Monday.

22:17.074 --> 22:19.250
Amsterdam?

22:19.338 --> 22:20.426
Why the hell does he want
to go to Amsterdam?

22:20.513 --> 22:21.557
No idea.

22:21.644 --> 22:23.907
School's back in session
on Monday.

22:23.994 --> 22:26.475
It's a weird time for a teacher
to take a vacation.

22:26.562 --> 22:27.824
Alert Customs
and Border Patrol,

22:27.911 --> 22:29.652
and put a TECS stop on them.

22:29.739 --> 22:31.219
I'm gonna go see Kristin
and Sheryll in Westchester.

22:31.306 --> 22:32.351
Find out more about
our latest victim.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.529
Neighbor heard the gunshot.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.008
First she thought
that Rico had backed

22:38.095 --> 22:40.097
into one of the pillars
out here.

22:40.184 --> 22:41.360
She knows Rico?

22:41.447 --> 22:42.361
He lives here with his dad.

22:42.448 --> 22:43.840
That's why Adam wanted his car.

22:43.927 --> 22:46.016
Apparently,
there's a transponder in it

22:46.103 --> 22:48.018
that let him into the gate
without having to ID himself.

22:48.105 --> 22:49.977
What do we know
about our victim?

22:50.064 --> 22:51.457
His name is William Hunter,
former senator

22:51.544 --> 22:53.372
during the second
Bush administration.

22:53.459 --> 22:54.764
Retired from politics in 2014,

22:54.851 --> 22:57.767
lost his wife to COVID
in May of 2020.

22:57.854 --> 23:00.074
Why the hell is Moore
going after a retired senator?

23:00.161 --> 23:01.989
Excuse me.

23:02.076 --> 23:03.991
- Ma'am, hold on.
- I'm looking for Agent Scott.

23:04.078 --> 23:05.253
That'd be me.

23:06.472 --> 23:07.516
Oh, God.

23:07.603 --> 23:09.126
William.

23:09.213 --> 23:11.564
Liv Whitley, DOJ.

23:11.651 --> 23:13.130
I've been out
with my family all day,

23:13.217 --> 23:15.263
and I didn't hear about the
shootings until an hour ago.

23:15.350 --> 23:16.525
You knew him?

23:16.612 --> 23:18.832
Everybody
in our section does.

23:18.919 --> 23:20.747
I also know Adam Moore.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.531
As soon as I saw
that's who you were chasing,

23:22.618 --> 23:24.315
I called your office,
and they sent me here.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.013
And how do you know Adam?

23:26.100 --> 23:27.580
He came to see me
at work two weeks ago.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.843
Weaseled his way
past my assistant

23:29.930 --> 23:31.584
with a list of names.

23:31.671 --> 23:33.324
War criminals he wanted us
to go after.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.674
What kind of war criminals?

23:34.761 --> 23:36.110
He couldn't really say.

23:36.197 --> 23:37.807
He had no evidence,
just this list of names

23:37.894 --> 23:41.028
and vague allegations
about supposed atrocities

23:41.115 --> 23:44.423
that happened on some island
in Asia decades ago.

23:44.510 --> 23:46.425
Was the island in Thailand?

23:46.512 --> 23:47.730
I don't know.
I had never heard of it.

23:47.817 --> 23:49.645
Honestly, I thought
he was a crackpot,

23:49.732 --> 23:51.908
and I just wanted
to get him out of my office.

23:51.995 --> 23:53.910
Did he say what he wanted?

23:53.997 --> 23:56.173
He wanted the names
on his list referred

23:56.260 --> 23:57.958
to the International Criminal
Court for prosecution.

23:58.045 --> 24:01.091
I told him that wouldn't
be possible since the U.S.

24:01.178 --> 24:04.094
hasn't been a participating
member in the ICC since 2002

24:04.181 --> 24:07.794
because of the Protection Act,
which Senator Hunter wrote.

24:07.881 --> 24:10.318
I can't believe this.

24:10.405 --> 24:11.406
I think I'm getting it now.

24:13.756 --> 24:17.194
Moore thinks these Thai men
are war criminals.

24:17.281 --> 24:18.718
When he finds out
they can't be prosecuted,

24:18.805 --> 24:20.894
he starts taking them out
on his own.

24:20.981 --> 24:23.374
And he blames Hunter for
taking the U.S. out of the ICC

24:23.462 --> 24:24.941
and decides
to make him pay too.

24:25.028 --> 24:26.552
We need to see that list.

24:26.639 --> 24:28.205
Every name on there
could be a potential target.

24:28.292 --> 24:29.380
It's at my office.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.817
We'll have to go
back into the city.

24:30.904 --> 24:32.122
Hmm.

24:32.209 --> 24:34.821
I love a workaholic.

24:34.908 --> 24:38.825
Hey.

24:38.912 --> 24:41.784
You got to enjoy the radio
before they start cranking

24:41.871 --> 24:43.482
all that holiday music,
you know.

24:56.669 --> 24:59.889
I gave it a lot of thought.

24:59.976 --> 25:00.934
Okay.

25:01.021 --> 25:02.936
What the hell is that?

25:10.552 --> 25:11.988
Are you crazy or something?

25:12.075 --> 25:14.164
What the hell
is this guy's problem?

25:16.210 --> 25:18.081
Dad, get out.

25:18.168 --> 25:19.648
- What are you doing?
- Dad, just--just get out.

25:19.735 --> 25:21.694
Give me your phone.
You got location services on.

25:23.870 --> 25:26.350
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey. Stay right here.

25:26.437 --> 25:27.438
Leave that old man alone.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.353
- Shut up!
- Yo, I mean it.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.530
I'm gonna call 911.
Leave him alone.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.183
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

25:33.270 --> 25:36.143
Hey, where are you going?
Come on.

25:36.230 --> 25:38.232
- Adam.
- Come on.

25:38.319 --> 25:39.538
It's Thanksgiving.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.540
Hey, shut up and be thankful.

25:41.627 --> 25:42.715
Get in.

25:45.021 --> 25:46.806
It's all right. It's okay.

25:55.031 --> 25:56.511
911, I want to report
an emergency.

26:02.952 --> 26:04.519
Grant's been my friend
for many years.

26:04.606 --> 26:07.914
I was going with him
to JFK to, uh,

26:08.001 --> 26:10.307
to say goodbye
for the last time.

26:10.394 --> 26:11.874
Last time?

26:11.961 --> 26:13.615
He's gonna a clinic
in Amsterdam,

26:13.702 --> 26:15.138
where he'll die
by assisted suicide.

26:15.225 --> 26:18.098
It's not legal here
unless you're terminal.

26:18.185 --> 26:19.926
He's just in so much pain.

26:20.013 --> 26:21.362
I understand.

26:21.449 --> 26:23.146
All right, I appreciate that.
Thank you.

26:23.233 --> 26:25.496
Was Adam supposed to fly to
Amsterdam next week with him?

26:25.584 --> 26:29.152
Yes, but after hearing
about what Adam's done,

26:29.239 --> 26:31.285
Grant chose to go early.

26:31.372 --> 26:33.853
There's just nothing here
for him anymore.

26:33.940 --> 26:35.855
I got nothing from the driver
except he saw Adam

26:35.942 --> 26:38.640
heading towards
the southbound ramp.

26:38.727 --> 26:40.903
Adam went to the DOJ
with a list of Thai men

26:40.990 --> 26:43.036
he claimed were war criminals.

26:43.123 --> 26:45.255
You know anything about that?

26:45.342 --> 26:47.301
The pirates.

26:47.388 --> 26:49.869
After Saigon fell,
many people tried

26:49.956 --> 26:52.001
to escape Vietnam by boat.

26:52.088 --> 26:54.090
The ones who drowned
were lucky.

26:54.177 --> 26:57.877
The unlucky ones were attacked
by Thai pirates at sea.

26:57.964 --> 27:02.272
They marooned us
on Nam Cha Island.

27:02.359 --> 27:04.448
I was with my family.

27:04.535 --> 27:07.408
We were alive, thanks to Grant.

27:07.495 --> 27:12.108
He was a pilot flying over when
he spotted us on the island.

27:12.195 --> 27:14.763
The world had no idea
we were there.

27:14.850 --> 27:18.462
Grant himself organized
many rescue missions by boat.

27:18.549 --> 27:20.421
It was very dangerous,
but he came

27:20.508 --> 27:25.034
and saved hundreds of
Vietnamese refugees like me.

27:25.121 --> 27:28.255
We all owe him our lives.

27:28.342 --> 27:30.170
Maybe Adam believed
that these pirates

27:30.257 --> 27:33.869
would someday be brought
to justice.

27:33.956 --> 27:36.611
And then losing his dad
put a clock on it.

27:36.698 --> 27:38.091
Adam wants his dad
to see justice done

27:38.178 --> 27:39.701
while he's still alive.

27:39.788 --> 27:41.660
First he goes to the DOJ
hoping they'll prosecute

27:41.747 --> 27:43.183
the pirates
through official channels

27:43.270 --> 27:44.880
like the Nuremberg trials.

27:44.967 --> 27:47.056
Yeah, but they don't,
so Adam decides

27:47.143 --> 27:49.102
he's gonna step up
and save the day.

27:49.189 --> 27:50.320
Can you pull up
those photos again?

27:50.407 --> 27:52.235
Yeah.

27:52.322 --> 27:54.063
Adam ID'd these six men

27:54.150 --> 27:55.325
to the DOJ
as these Thai pirates.

27:55.412 --> 27:57.110
He's killed three so far.

27:57.197 --> 27:57.893
Yeah, two of them
were brothers

27:57.980 --> 27:59.329
who became Buddhist monks.

27:59.416 --> 28:01.114
That's why Adam
attacked the temple.

28:01.201 --> 28:04.291
The third is Arthit Anwar,
killed in Central Park.

28:06.075 --> 28:08.687
Have you seen them before
from Nam Cha Island?

28:12.255 --> 28:13.822
Do you recognize
the other three?

28:13.909 --> 28:15.694
I'm not sure.

28:15.781 --> 28:20.263
But the one face
I do know is one pirate.

28:20.350 --> 28:21.961
He was maybe 20 years old,

28:22.048 --> 28:23.136
but already crueler
than the others.

28:25.660 --> 28:29.316
He raped my mother many times.

28:29.403 --> 28:32.449
But what killed her...

28:32.536 --> 28:35.061
was a broken heart when
he murdered my baby brother.

28:38.194 --> 28:41.415
That man had a scar
across his face.

28:44.418 --> 28:46.812
I see that face every night.

28:46.899 --> 28:48.770
Wait here a minute,
Mr. Bui.

28:51.425 --> 28:54.384
You started it.

28:54.471 --> 28:56.343
You decided to go to Amsterdam.

29:00.782 --> 29:02.305
I'm sorry, son.

29:05.134 --> 29:07.484
Tried to hold out, you know,
I couldn't take it anymore.

29:07.571 --> 29:09.095
The pain just got too much.

29:09.182 --> 29:11.010
I had to choose.

29:11.097 --> 29:12.576
You get to choose death.

29:14.448 --> 29:15.754
Why don't I?

29:25.851 --> 29:26.808
I love you too.

29:29.028 --> 29:30.986
But you weren't even
gonna say goodbye.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.907
You know, when you were--

29:38.994 --> 29:41.910
you were very small,

29:41.997 --> 29:44.608
you'd wake up in the morning,
you'd always have a big smile

29:44.695 --> 29:48.569
and say, "Hello, sun."

29:48.656 --> 29:50.527
You remember that?

29:50.614 --> 29:51.790
I don't want to hear any
of this crap right now.

29:51.877 --> 29:54.183
Well, you're gonna
hear it anyway.

29:54.270 --> 29:57.752
But then at night, when we
put you to bed, you'd just--

29:57.839 --> 29:59.188
you'd cry and cry.

29:59.275 --> 30:00.581
Couldn't stop crying.

30:00.668 --> 30:01.930
We didn't know what to do.

30:02.017 --> 30:03.149
We kept the lights on.

30:03.236 --> 30:04.759
We bought you a night light.

30:04.846 --> 30:07.370
I'd sit up with you at night
and try to comfort you,

30:07.457 --> 30:09.198
but nothing worked.

30:09.285 --> 30:13.028
You just cry and cry until
you cried yourself to sleep.

30:13.115 --> 30:16.902
And then, your mom.

30:16.989 --> 30:18.599
She told this story.

30:18.686 --> 30:24.474
She said, uh, told you how
the sun shined on you all day.

30:24.561 --> 30:27.782
And that warmth inside you,
that light,

30:27.869 --> 30:30.350
it would stay with you
all night long

30:30.437 --> 30:33.962
so you didn't have to be
afraid of the dark anymore.

30:34.049 --> 30:35.834
That seemed to work.

30:38.445 --> 30:40.708
God bless her.

30:40.795 --> 30:44.277
And that's why you didn't
have to be afraid anymore.

30:44.364 --> 30:47.802
Because that light
would always,

30:47.889 --> 30:49.630
always be inside you.

30:56.071 --> 30:57.943
Innocent people.

30:59.814 --> 31:01.555
I didn't know.

31:01.642 --> 31:03.122
I didn't know they were
gonna be in there, Dad.

31:05.689 --> 31:08.083
What are we gonna do?

31:17.614 --> 31:19.703
Where are we?

31:21.749 --> 31:22.750
You'll see.

31:28.234 --> 31:30.584
So if this guy was around 20
in the late '70s,

31:30.671 --> 31:32.020
he'd be in his 60s today.

31:32.107 --> 31:34.370
We're running a general search
of Thai men

31:34.457 --> 31:37.939
between the ages of 55 and 65
with distinct facial scarring.

31:38.026 --> 31:40.333
My guess is,
he's not on the list.

31:40.420 --> 31:42.552
That Adam always planned
to go after him personally.

31:42.639 --> 31:44.076
<i>Well, we came up
with a short list,</i>

31:44.163 --> 31:46.556
and we're eliminating any
possible matches as we go.

31:46.643 --> 31:48.428
Two of the hits
are already deceased.

31:48.515 --> 31:50.996
Eliminate the men with
trackable employment histories.

31:51.083 --> 31:53.520
They'd have to disclose that
information to immigration.

31:53.607 --> 31:55.435
And I bet you can't put down
pirate as an occupation

31:55.522 --> 31:58.960
without inviting some serious
questions from the DHS.

31:59.047 --> 32:00.875
Okay, I got
a potential match.

32:00.962 --> 32:02.964
<i>Lek Saengarun.</i>

32:03.051 --> 32:06.011
Lek has fisherman listed
as his occupation in Thailand.

32:06.098 --> 32:07.838
<i>Send it to me now.</i>

32:07.926 --> 32:09.710
Done, and I'm sending you his
address and phone number too.

32:14.845 --> 32:15.977
That's him.

32:16.064 --> 32:18.545
He killed my baby brother.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.373
And the first time
Grant tried to rescue us,

32:20.460 --> 32:22.984
he shot down his plane.

32:23.071 --> 32:24.551
Grant almost died.

32:24.638 --> 32:25.987
Adam's wife told us
that Grant has

32:26.074 --> 32:27.641
degenerative lumbar disease.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.425
That could have been
caused in the plane crash.

32:29.512 --> 32:31.601
So Adam holds Lek responsible
for his dad's condition,

32:31.688 --> 32:33.908
for the chronic pain
that's making Grant choose

32:33.995 --> 32:35.779
to end his life
by assisted suicide.

32:35.866 --> 32:37.912
Yeah, and maybe he took
his dad to go after Lek.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.783
Witness his murder,
eye for an eye.

32:39.870 --> 32:41.916
Vengeance begets vengeance.

32:42.003 --> 32:44.397
Adam's anger is like hot coals.

32:44.484 --> 32:46.573
He wants to throw his rage
at the men who hurt us.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.575
But in holding on
to that anger,

32:48.662 --> 32:50.620
he only hurts himself the most.

32:50.707 --> 32:52.535
Don't you want these men
punished too?

32:54.276 --> 32:57.018
Karma will find a way.

32:57.105 --> 32:58.846
<i>Lek's not
answering his phone,</i>

32:58.933 --> 33:00.195
but we talked to his wife.

33:00.282 --> 33:01.457
He's working today
in the restaurant

33:01.544 --> 33:03.024
they own in Brooklyn.

33:03.111 --> 33:04.547
She says Thanksgiving
is one of the busiest

33:04.634 --> 33:06.375
<i>days of the year.
It's got to be packed.</i>

33:06.462 --> 33:07.550
Send us the address.

33:07.637 --> 33:08.595
We'll meet you
at the restaurant.

33:08.682 --> 33:09.639
<i>Copy that.</i>

33:13.034 --> 33:14.514
Wait here.

33:54.162 --> 33:55.163
Keep going.
Can you take them?

33:55.250 --> 33:55.990
Come on.

33:56.077 --> 33:57.600
Just take them down.

34:00.255 --> 34:01.256
They're barricaded
in the kitchen.

34:01.343 --> 34:02.649
Witnesses say Adam's armed.

34:02.736 --> 34:04.303
Most people are out,
but they're still

34:04.390 --> 34:05.956
a couple of civilians
in the dining area.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.002
Should we wait for SWAT?

34:08.089 --> 34:09.395
No time. Go, go, go!

34:14.182 --> 34:15.227
Let me see your hands.

34:15.314 --> 34:18.491
In the kitchen.
They've got Lek.

34:18.578 --> 34:22.060
Come on. Come on.
Out, out, out, out.

34:22.147 --> 34:23.191
- Ray!
- Yeah?

34:23.278 --> 34:24.410
- Come on.
- Got you.

34:24.497 --> 34:25.976
Hey, right behind you.
Come with me.

34:40.034 --> 34:41.818
FBI! Drop the gun.

34:41.905 --> 34:43.603
Drop it.

34:43.690 --> 34:44.647
Don't move.

34:44.734 --> 34:46.388
I'll kill him right now.

34:46.475 --> 34:48.173
Adam.

34:48.260 --> 34:50.697
A wise man recently said to me,

34:50.784 --> 34:53.743
vengeance begets vengeance.

34:53.830 --> 34:56.485
Sound familiar, Grant?

34:56.572 --> 34:57.921
Tony said that.

34:58.008 --> 34:58.879
Tony, your best friend.

34:58.966 --> 35:00.620
Shut up!

35:00.707 --> 35:02.883
You don't know anything
about what this man did.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.928
Tony knows what he did.

35:05.015 --> 35:06.234
He survived it.

35:09.846 --> 35:13.154
This is not right, son.

35:13.241 --> 35:15.243
This is not our legacy.

35:15.330 --> 35:17.332
It's not your legacy?

35:17.419 --> 35:22.076
You saved Tony, Mom,
all those people.

35:22.163 --> 35:24.296
But look at the pain you're in!

35:24.383 --> 35:26.820
While he's walking around,
living his life,

35:26.907 --> 35:28.430
driving his beamer.

35:28.517 --> 35:31.694
Your suffering
is because of him.

35:31.781 --> 35:32.869
You're my son.

35:32.956 --> 35:34.958
You're my legacy.

35:35.045 --> 35:38.658
And this,
what you're doing now,

35:38.745 --> 35:40.442
can't be our legacy.

35:40.529 --> 35:44.838
Whatever you do now,
that'll be our legacy.

35:44.925 --> 35:49.277
It's not even a fraction
of what they deserve.

35:49.364 --> 35:50.800
Tell 'em what kind of
man you really are.

35:50.887 --> 35:53.760
Please! Please!

35:53.847 --> 35:56.545
I want the whole world
to know and punish him

35:56.632 --> 35:58.417
for what he did
on Nam Cha Island.

35:58.504 --> 36:00.593
That is not
your choice, Adam.

36:00.680 --> 36:03.900
Put the gun down and we'll
see to it he goes to trial.

36:03.987 --> 36:04.901
I tried that.

36:04.988 --> 36:07.339
That's a lie.

36:07.426 --> 36:10.080
If you're not gonna tell them,
I will.

36:12.779 --> 36:16.217
The pirates,
they raped all the women.

36:16.304 --> 36:18.176
Girls as young as five and six.

36:18.263 --> 36:20.961
The men and boys,
they tortured.

36:21.048 --> 36:23.877
And the babies.

36:23.964 --> 36:25.574
Tell them.

36:25.661 --> 36:28.751
Tell them what
you did to the babies.

36:28.838 --> 36:31.232
Tell them what you did
to Tony's brother.

36:33.582 --> 36:36.977
They swung them by the ankles
and bashed their brains

36:37.064 --> 36:38.892
up against the shore.

36:38.979 --> 36:40.241
Isn't that right?

36:40.328 --> 36:43.375
Adam, the public
will only know the truth

36:43.462 --> 36:47.030
of what happened
if you put that gun down

36:47.117 --> 36:48.162
and let us take him in.

36:51.252 --> 36:53.602
You're right.

36:53.689 --> 36:58.216
He deserves to be punished
for his atrocities,

36:58.303 --> 37:01.001
but do it the right way.

37:05.048 --> 37:08.530
Adam, give me the gun.

37:08.617 --> 37:12.404
You know,
you receive from the world

37:12.491 --> 37:15.015
what you give to the world.

37:15.102 --> 37:20.847
I always tried and did my best
for you and our family.

37:20.934 --> 37:27.288
Provide, well, good karma.

37:29.899 --> 37:31.684
Give me the gun.

37:31.771 --> 37:32.815
It's all right.

37:32.902 --> 37:34.991
This is over.

37:35.078 --> 37:38.995
Adam, give me the gun.

37:39.082 --> 37:41.041
Come on, son. Please.

37:43.913 --> 37:45.393
Give it to me.

37:49.658 --> 37:50.442
That's it.

37:54.750 --> 37:56.012
I have the gun.

37:56.099 --> 37:57.057
I have the gun.

38:06.588 --> 38:08.851
It's okay.

38:08.938 --> 38:10.462
It's all right.

38:20.210 --> 38:21.299
- Don't do it, Grant!
- No! No!

38:21.386 --> 38:23.170
No, Dad, no!

38:23.257 --> 38:25.825
No, Dad, Dad! Dad!

38:25.912 --> 38:27.827
Dad, no!

38:27.914 --> 38:29.829
No, Dad.

38:33.223 --> 38:35.095
On the ground. Let's go.

38:46.062 --> 38:46.846
Ready to get home?

38:46.933 --> 38:49.065
Oh, yeah.

38:49.152 --> 38:51.807
It's too late to make my mom's
pumpkin pie from scratch.

38:51.894 --> 38:54.027
I have to pick up
a ready crust and hope

38:54.114 --> 38:55.594
Charlotte doesn't notice.

38:55.681 --> 38:58.248
You?
- Oh, Ingrid's handling dinner,

38:58.336 --> 38:59.685
but she's a vegetarian
this month.

38:59.772 --> 39:02.122
I fear a tofurkey in my future.

39:06.300 --> 39:08.476
April, hey, sorry.
I'm on my way.

39:08.563 --> 39:09.259
<i>You know what,
don't worry about it.</i>

39:09.347 --> 39:11.261
<i>I'm almost in Oyster Bay.</i>

39:11.349 --> 39:13.525
I actually decided to have
dinner with my family instead.

39:13.612 --> 39:15.135
No, I'll just stop off
and shower

39:15.222 --> 39:16.528
and change
and I'll meet you there.

39:16.615 --> 39:17.920
<i>I can make it
in time for dessert.</i>

39:18.007 --> 39:19.618
I'll bring your
favorite bottle of wine.

39:19.705 --> 39:21.315
That's not necessary, Remy.

39:21.402 --> 39:23.796
<i>I know, but I want to.</i>

39:23.883 --> 39:26.799
I don't want you to.

39:26.886 --> 39:31.020
Listen, we both know where
this is headed, don't we?

39:31.107 --> 39:32.761
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

39:32.848 --> 39:34.372
<i>It's better
to end it now than</i>

39:34.459 --> 39:36.548
<i>to limp through the holidays.</i>

39:36.635 --> 39:38.767
But we had a good run there.

39:38.854 --> 39:42.467
<i>You just have to fly south
for the winter.</i>

39:42.554 --> 39:44.033
<i>And you know,
at first I thought</i>

39:44.120 --> 39:45.948
you were afraid of commitment,
but that's not true.

39:46.035 --> 39:49.691
You are committed--
to your work.

39:49.778 --> 39:51.519
<i>And that's okay,
you know, that's you.</i>

39:51.606 --> 39:54.392
But, uh, that's not me.

39:54.479 --> 39:56.524
At least not
at this point in my life.

39:59.527 --> 40:00.963
April, I am sorry.

40:01.050 --> 40:03.183
Don't be.

40:03.270 --> 40:05.011
Let's just be thankful for
the time that we had together.

40:08.928 --> 40:10.408
I got to go.

40:14.499 --> 40:15.761
Everything okay?

40:19.852 --> 40:21.506
Not really.

40:21.593 --> 40:24.422
I just had to kill a war hero,
and April and I are a wrap.

40:24.509 --> 40:26.380
She broke up with you
on Thanksgiving?

40:26.467 --> 40:28.382
Can you blame her?

40:28.469 --> 40:30.602
I'm married to the job.
It's been coming for a while.

40:32.865 --> 40:34.083
What?

40:34.170 --> 40:35.607
Nothing.

40:35.694 --> 40:37.957
I mean, you don't
like to be tied down.

40:38.044 --> 40:39.872
I'm sorry, man.

40:39.959 --> 40:41.830
I didn't know
you had a girlfriend.

40:41.917 --> 40:43.876
Kind of my point.

40:43.963 --> 40:45.399
On the bright side,
at least you get to go home,

40:45.486 --> 40:47.880
watch some football,
not feel guilty.

40:47.967 --> 40:49.490
You're not
watching football,

40:49.577 --> 40:51.623
and you're not
going home alone.

40:51.710 --> 40:53.363
Have you ever had
Ray's cooking?

40:53.451 --> 40:54.843
Can't say I have.

40:54.930 --> 40:55.714
Well, good,
because it's terrible.

40:55.801 --> 40:57.629
But I think between
the three of us,

40:57.716 --> 40:58.717
we can whip up
something decent.

41:00.762 --> 41:02.590
Hold--it--

41:07.943 --> 41:09.423
I've got to get
a universal remote.

41:09.510 --> 41:10.598
Hey, I said no football.

41:10.685 --> 41:11.991
I recorded the parade earlier.

41:12.078 --> 41:13.906
Put it on.
- All right, that's it.

41:13.993 --> 41:15.908
I'm kicking you off.
I'm DJ'ing now.

41:15.995 --> 41:17.866
Why? I like this song.

41:17.953 --> 41:19.738
Oh!
My potatoes are boiling over.

41:19.825 --> 41:21.348
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got you. I got you.

41:21.435 --> 41:22.784
Hey, don't burn
the baby turkeys.

41:22.871 --> 41:26.092
He knows they're not turkeys.

41:26.179 --> 41:28.094
They're Cornish hens
thanks to you, genius.

41:28.181 --> 41:29.661
Hey listen, I'm good,

41:29.748 --> 41:31.053
but even I can't
track down a butterball

41:31.140 --> 41:32.838
at 5:00 on Thanksgiving Day.

41:33.926 --> 41:36.319
both: Oh!
- Ooh, what is this?

41:36.406 --> 41:38.234
Are you kidding?

41:38.321 --> 41:40.672
You don't know Teddy P?

41:40.759 --> 41:43.849
- That's my jam.
- Oh. Oh, yeah.

41:43.936 --> 41:47.200
- What, what.
- Whoo!

41:47.287 --> 41:49.550
- What you want me to do?
- Okay, uh, carrots and celery.

41:49.637 --> 41:52.161
Start chopping.
- Mmm.

41:52.248 --> 41:54.033
both singing along:
♪ It's so good ♪

41:54.120 --> 41:56.296
Hey.

41:56.383 --> 41:59.821
both: ♪ Loving somebody

41:59.908 --> 42:00.909
Whoo!

42:00.996 --> 42:02.520
So good.

42:02.607 --> 42:03.912
- ♪ To be loved ♪
- To be loved.

42:03.999 --> 42:05.958
Uh, uh!

42:06.045 --> 42:09.309
both: ♪ And be loved in return
is the only thing ♪

42:09.396 --> 42:11.529
♪ That my heart desires ♪

42:11.616 --> 42:13.313
Hey, toast. Appreciation.

42:13.400 --> 42:15.663
Cheers.
- Cheers.

42:15.750 --> 42:17.491

42:17.578 --> 42:20.276
