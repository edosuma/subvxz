After all these years of
working with me, haven't you
fucking learned anything?

00:20.271 --> 00:21.564
Now it could all be mouldy

00:21.647 --> 00:23.649
and we could be fucked,
you fucking dumbass.

00:23.733 --> 00:25.526
I'm a dumbass?

00:25.610 --> 00:27.570
I'm not the weed
guy here, okay?

00:27.653 --> 00:29.113
We're in this
fucked-up situation

00:29.196 --> 00:30.656
because of you, not me!

00:30.740 --> 00:31.991
(Chuckling)
Whatever.

00:32.073 --> 00:34.326
Whatever...
I can't believe

00:34.410 --> 00:37.455
you actually thought
Lahey was your father.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.999
Like, what the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

00:40.082 --> 00:41.500
You're fucking stupid.

00:41.584 --> 00:45.379
Like really, for real,
truly fucking stupid.

00:45.463 --> 00:46.756
(Scoffing)

00:50.593 --> 00:52.136
Look, man...

00:52.219 --> 00:54.973
I'm sorry.
You're not stupid.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.223
Lahey was
pretty convincing.

00:56.307 --> 00:58.183
He almost had me
fooled too.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.812
I know you've been through
a lot, but we all have.

01:00.895 --> 01:03.022
But just so that you know,
man, you're my best friend.

01:03.147 --> 01:05.984
I'd do anything
for you, okay?

01:06.066 --> 01:07.693
So can we
please be cool?

01:07.777 --> 01:09.988
Please.
(Sighs)

01:10.070 --> 01:11.656
Just don't call me
the s-word, man.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.699
It's not cool anymore
and it's fucking mean.

01:13.783 --> 01:16.076
All right, man,
I promise. I won't.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.411
Bubbles: (On radio)
<i>Breaker, breaker.</i>

01:17.495 --> 01:19.163
What the fuck?

01:19.246 --> 01:20.706
<i>Got to stop, bud.</i>

01:20.790 --> 01:23.167
Bubs, what the fuck
are you doing?

01:23.250 --> 01:26.587
Where the fuck are those
two stupid idiots going?

01:26.671 --> 01:28.006
<i>Jacob's got the shits</i>

01:28.088 --> 01:29.841
<i>and Cory said, and I quote,</i>

01:29.924 --> 01:32.927
<i>"Right on, dude,</i>
<i>I'll come with you."</i>

01:33.011 --> 01:34.971
<i>Should we just</i>
<i>wait for them or...</i>

01:35.054 --> 01:37.015
No, fuck 'em.
Tell them to meet
us up there.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.684
It's just up this road
here to the right.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.226
Fucking idiots.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.187
<i>Well, head up the</i>
<i>road to the right,</i>

01:43.270 --> 01:44.897
<i>right down to the lake,</i>
<i>when you're done shitting.</i>

01:47.608 --> 01:49.234
<i>Boys, just so you're aware,</i>

01:49.318 --> 01:51.863
<i>Jacob's been shitting</i>
<i>green liquid lately.</i>

01:51.946 --> 01:54.699
<i>Green fucking</i>
<i>liquid. He's an alien,</i>
<i>I'm telling you.</i>

01:54.782 --> 01:57.242
<i>Keep your head</i>
<i>on a swivel around him. Over.</i>

01:57.326 --> 01:58.577
What if he is
a fucking alien?

01:58.661 --> 01:59.954
Like, is it possible
he could turn

02:00.038 --> 02:01.747
my whole family
into fucking
aliens or...?

02:01.831 --> 02:04.083
How many times do I
got to go through
this with you?

02:04.166 --> 02:05.710
Just because you
look like an alien

02:05.793 --> 02:07.795
doesn't mean you're
a fucking alien.

02:07.879 --> 02:09.755
He's not one.

02:09.839 --> 02:11.049
Man!

02:11.131 --> 02:12.424
What the fuck...

02:12.508 --> 02:14.052
What are all these
fucking signs up here?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.887
Free weed?
Free weed?

02:15.970 --> 02:17.889
Right on. Let's go
fucking get some.

02:17.972 --> 02:20.391
No, Ricky, this is
where I fucking live.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.560
Oh, yeah.
<i>Boys, what the fuck</i>
<i>are these signs?</i>

02:22.643 --> 02:24.395
Oh, fuck...

02:24.478 --> 02:26.605
Oh, fuck!

02:26.689 --> 02:28.607
<i>Holy fuck, boys,</i>
<i>is that our weed?</i>
<i>Did you see that?</i>

02:28.691 --> 02:30.234
Yeah, we saw it.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.861
<i>What the fuck are</i>
<i>we going to do?</i>

02:31.944 --> 02:34.238
<i>Like, that's got</i>
<i>to be our weed.</i>

02:34.321 --> 02:36.407
It better
fucking not be.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.617
For fuck's sakes.

02:38.701 --> 02:40.912
Is that Lahey's
fucking camper?

02:40.995 --> 02:42.788
Fuck.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.625
Lahey:
(Cackling)

02:46.709 --> 02:48.086
What the fuck do
these idiot want?

02:48.168 --> 02:50.337
Get out of my
fucking way.

02:50.421 --> 02:52.214
Get going!
(Tires skidding on gravel)

02:54.050 --> 02:56.010
(Feedback)
(Slurring)
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:56.094 --> 02:57.929
please welcome
to the stage,

02:58.012 --> 03:01.348
the man you've all been
waiting for, Julian!

03:01.432 --> 03:03.976
The owner of the free weed!

03:04.060 --> 03:05.895
Various:
Free weed!

03:05.978 --> 03:07.855
(Chanting)
Free weed, free weed,
free weed...

03:07.939 --> 03:09.774
All right...
everybody...

03:09.857 --> 03:12.317
Everybody shut
the fuck up!

03:12.401 --> 03:13.611
Jesus Christ.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.029
Hey, that old
guy over there

03:15.113 --> 03:16.447
said that this
thing was full.
Come on, man.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.116
Well, that old
guy's drunk

03:18.198 --> 03:19.617
and he's out
of his goddamn
fucking mind.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.827
Hey, bro, that's
false advertising, man.

03:21.911 --> 03:24.789
False advertising.
What are you going to do,
call the cops on me?

03:24.872 --> 03:26.665
Look, everybody,
there's no weed here, okay?

03:26.749 --> 03:29.209
There's no free
fucking weed.
You gotta leave.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.796
(Sigh)
Fuck.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.923
(Whispering)
Julian, this is fucked.
What are we going to do?

03:34.006 --> 03:36.134
I want you to go up the
road, okay, take down
those fucking signs.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.804
Can you do that for me?
Oh, I'll get the
cocksuckers down.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.389
Excuse me, who do we talk
to about the free weed?

03:42.473 --> 03:44.224
There's no weed.
Fuck off.

03:44.308 --> 03:45.977
Woman:
Wo-ow.
(Chuckling)

03:46.060 --> 03:48.228
What the fuck's
going on here, Lahey?
Oh!

03:48.312 --> 03:50.272
Randy, would you get
that out of my face.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.900
We were just enjoying
a couple of drinkie-poos

03:52.984 --> 03:54.652
down by the old sea-side.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.362
Listen... Randy?

03:57.446 --> 03:59.281
Don't you think you
should tell these people

03:59.364 --> 04:02.118
to get off your
property, Julian?

04:02.201 --> 04:04.870
(Laughing)
This isn't my
property, okay?

04:04.954 --> 04:06.371
I don't know what
you're talking about.

04:06.455 --> 04:09.041
Oh, it isn't?
Oh, that's fantastic.

04:09.125 --> 04:12.336
Because Randy and I are
planning to spend a couple
of days down here,

04:12.419 --> 04:15.923
just relaxing and
maybe working out
our wedding plans.

04:16.007 --> 04:19.384
But are there usually
that many people

04:19.468 --> 04:21.720
hanging out around
here, Julian?
I don't know.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.305
I don't have a clue.
I'm never out here.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.556
No?
No.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.600
Don't worry, Mr. Lahey.

04:26.684 --> 04:29.020
If any of these dirty,
filthy, shit-hippies
get out of control,

04:29.103 --> 04:30.938
I've got the police
on speed-dial.

04:31.022 --> 04:32.314
I've got you
on fuck-off dial.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.108
Julian...

04:34.192 --> 04:35.609
there's nothing sexier

04:35.693 --> 04:38.196
than having a powerful
man in your grip

04:38.278 --> 04:40.698
and watching him squirm.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.950
Fuck you.

04:43.034 --> 04:45.911
Hi, Rick.

04:45.995 --> 04:48.706
Don't give up, guys.
Free weed's a-comin'!

04:48.789 --> 04:52.710
The whole fucking
container's full
of that shit.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.754
(Theme music)

05:38.630 --> 05:41.050
(Police siren chirps)

05:41.133 --> 05:43.052
Excuse me, sir.
Keep you hands where
we can see them.

05:43.135 --> 05:45.054
Yes, sir.
Drop the weapon, please.

05:45.137 --> 05:47.598
Oh, that's not
a weapon. That's...

05:47.681 --> 05:49.934
Please just drop it.
...tool from
my truck there.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.810
So what's going on here?

05:51.894 --> 05:53.229
Oh... Oh, you're
probably wondering

05:53.312 --> 05:55.147
about that crazy
sign there, eh?

05:55.231 --> 05:57.900
Yeah, we had
a couple of people
who phoned in about it.

05:57.983 --> 05:59.902
Yeah, no, that's...
What's your name?

05:59.985 --> 06:01.237
My name is.... umm...
Yeah?

06:01.320 --> 06:02.738
My name's Bubbles.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.823
You guys...
you guys know Jim?

06:04.907 --> 06:06.158
Or Jim knows you?

06:06.242 --> 06:07.826
Jim who?

06:07.910 --> 06:09.287
Oh, there's
a lot of Jims.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.913
Maybe you know
one of the Jims.
Listen.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.915
What's your
involvement with this?

06:12.998 --> 06:15.293
Oh, this here?
It's just a big
misunderstanding.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.919
Misunderstanding?

06:17.002 --> 06:19.171
Yes, it's uh...
Why are you so
nervous then?

06:19.255 --> 06:21.632
Well, just you know,
because of what that says

06:21.715 --> 06:23.467
and it's not
supposed to say that.

06:23.550 --> 06:26.595
See, what happened
my friend, he has a...

06:26.678 --> 06:28.931
he has a big pile
of wood actually

06:29.014 --> 06:31.100
and he's been trying
to give it away

06:31.183 --> 06:33.311
and he asked some kids
to make some signs

06:33.393 --> 06:35.020
and obviously,
you know, they're
just fucking with him

06:35.104 --> 06:36.355
or they don't
know how to spell.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.023
All right, so there's
children involved,

06:38.107 --> 06:39.775
is what you're saying?
Well... no,

06:39.858 --> 06:41.693
I don't mean there's
children involved

06:41.777 --> 06:43.612
with that type of thing,
I just mean the...

06:43.695 --> 06:46.282
the local kids who
come and skip rocks
into the thing,

06:46.365 --> 06:47.950
they made these and...

06:48.033 --> 06:49.576
their parents are going
to fucking hear about this,

06:49.660 --> 06:51.287
believe me,
this is uncalled for.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.704
All right,
well, listen.

06:52.788 --> 06:55.207
Do you mind if we go
down to take a look?

06:55.291 --> 06:57.960
Uhhh, no, of course not.

06:58.043 --> 06:59.962
I've got nothing to hide.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.880
Let's... let's just go down.

07:01.964 --> 07:03.132
Sounds good.

07:03.215 --> 07:04.466
Okay, you guys...
Yep.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.135
Follow me.
Uh-huh.

07:06.218 --> 07:07.469
Ohh, boy.

07:07.552 --> 07:11.265
Come on, Julian,
answer your phone.

07:11.349 --> 07:12.808
Julian!
Julian: (on phone)
<i>What's up?</i>

07:12.891 --> 07:14.310
<i>Did you get the</i>
<i>signs taken care of?</i>

07:14.393 --> 07:16.103
Uhh, not exactly.

07:16.187 --> 07:18.605
The police came and
they're now following me

07:18.689 --> 07:19.857
and we're on our way there.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.942
<i>What?</i>
It's okay, though.

07:22.026 --> 07:24.862
I told them the sign
was supposed to say
wood instead of weed.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.031
So just get everybody
holding some wood.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.825
I repeat, make sure
everyone's got wood.

07:29.908 --> 07:32.494
Jesus Christ.
Drive slow, man.

07:32.577 --> 07:33.996
That's nice.
It's kind of like
pineapple diesel

07:34.079 --> 07:35.956
with a little bit
of bubble gum.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.209
Hey, man, what the fuck?
Everybody's got
to get some wood.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.752
The cops are on their way.
You want us to get
hard-ons for the cops?

07:40.836 --> 07:43.172
No, no, pick up some wood,
some firewood. Everybody pick
up some firewood!

07:43.255 --> 07:45.090
Woman:
I'm not doing that.
Put out the joints.

07:45.174 --> 07:46.925
Hold on a second, man.
The cops are on
their fucking way.

07:47.009 --> 07:48.510
Here?
Yes!

07:48.593 --> 07:51.347
Fuck!
Get some wood, everybody
get some wood.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.849
Bubbles, what the
fuck did you do, man?

07:53.932 --> 07:57.853
Lahey:
Oh, the cavalry
are here, Randers.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.647
What the fuck happened?
Just... Ricky, just...

08:03.108 --> 08:05.069
See, officers, just...
just like I said.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.196
Look at all the free wood.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.907
If you guys want some,
pop your trunk there and
I'll load you right up.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.533
Ricky:
Yeah, help yourselves.
I think we're fine.

08:11.616 --> 08:14.036
Good afternoon, officers.
Afternoon.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.704
Are you two the owners
of this here wood?

08:15.787 --> 08:17.331
No. We're just
here on vacation.

08:17.415 --> 08:19.541
We're just
watching the show.

08:19.624 --> 08:23.087
It's my wood, officers.
I just swapped out my
fucking wood stove.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.881
You know, I got
a heat pump, I'm saving
a ton of money every month.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.758
Air conditioning...
So you live here?

08:27.841 --> 08:30.094
Well, kind of.
So you own this
container then, right?

08:30.177 --> 08:34.765
Umm... it was kind
of given to me
but not really.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.017
Bravo, ossifer.
Bravo.

08:37.101 --> 08:39.395
It's not his container,
no, it was his dad's.

08:39.477 --> 08:42.688
We had to put him in a home.
He got dimensions and started
shitting all over the place.

08:42.773 --> 08:44.942
Thought he was
still storming the
jungles at Normanly.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.694
Sir, do you mind
opening up the
container for us?

08:47.778 --> 08:50.906
Love to but we lost the keys,
what... two months ago,
three months ago?

08:50.989 --> 08:53.075
A while ago anyway.
I'll go get the cutters.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.535
Oooh.
Guys, it's not going to
work. It's military grade.

08:55.619 --> 08:58.163
We tried. Cutters
aren't going to do it.

08:58.247 --> 09:00.416
Go ahead. Waste more fucking
taxpayers' money, I guess.

09:00.499 --> 09:02.918
No big fucking deal.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.628
Police officer:
I've got a shipping
container here.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.589
Alpha-Victor-Bravo
one-zero-niner.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.592
Could I get a ownership
title for that?
Woman: (on radio)<i> Copy.</i>

09:10.675 --> 09:12.470
Hi, guys. I just wanted to
formally introduce myself.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.762
My name's Randy.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.306
If you guys need
any assistance,

09:15.389 --> 09:17.808
I'm actually in training
to be a fellow member.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.518
You can't be
training very hard.

09:19.601 --> 09:20.811
Oh, my God.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.480
Not <i> the</i> Randy?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.273
The guys down at the
station were telling me

09:24.356 --> 09:25.649
about the legend
of the gut,

09:25.732 --> 09:29.903
but I never imagined
it would be so <i> massive.</i>

09:29.987 --> 09:32.531
We're going to need
a selfie with that.
Definitely.

09:32.614 --> 09:35.159
Ricky:
Is this seriously fucking
happening right now?

09:37.702 --> 09:39.704
(Phone camera clicks)

09:39.788 --> 09:42.082
I can't believe you
never heard of the fuck-up

09:42.166 --> 09:43.459
that's been trying
to get on the force

09:43.542 --> 09:45.961
with the
disgusting fat gut.

09:46.044 --> 09:49.131
Yeah, that's, uh,
that's pretty bad.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.674
That's not very
nice, guys.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.510
I'm not overweight,
I'm husky.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.178
You look like
you ate a husky.
A pack of huskies.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.637
Woman: (On radio)
<i>One Adam 12.</i>

09:55.720 --> 09:57.348
<i>The container was</i>
<i>sold in auction</i>

09:57.431 --> 09:59.683
<i>to a Reggie Rose.</i>
<i>No other information on file.</i>

09:59.766 --> 10:01.810
Copy that.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.812
I'm sorry. What the
fuck is it you guys
are doing here again?

10:03.895 --> 10:06.606
I forget that part.
Sir, would you watch
your language please?

10:06.690 --> 10:07.899
Watch langu...
What are we,
at fucking church?

10:07.983 --> 10:09.193
All right, listen.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.861
There was a sign
at the end of the road.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.321
It said "Free Weed".

10:12.404 --> 10:13.989
Oh, okay.

10:14.072 --> 10:15.657
And that's what you think
is happening here, is it?

10:15.740 --> 10:17.993
You know what, guys?
You got us.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.786
This container
right here...

10:19.870 --> 10:21.497
it's full of
fucking beautiful,
delicious weed

10:21.580 --> 10:23.457
and we're just
giving it away
to everybody.

10:23.541 --> 10:25.709
Come on over.
Get as much fucking
free weed as you want.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.628
Tell me you guys
aren't that
fucking stupid.

10:28.712 --> 10:32.591
I've never met two stupider
cops in my entire life.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.468
Both of you with
your good looks,

10:34.552 --> 10:37.179
your chiselled features
and toned bodies.

10:37.262 --> 10:40.682
It's not hard to tell that
that's the only reason
you made it on the force.

10:40.765 --> 10:44.895
I'd make a way better
cop than both of you
two shit-weasels.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.897
Fuck, it's bullcock!

10:46.980 --> 10:50.734
All right? And
it's not nice to
call anyone fat.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.070
I don't care
who you are.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.531
(Mixed cheers, applause)

10:55.614 --> 10:57.241
No... That's enough.
All right?

10:57.324 --> 10:59.410
Everybody take
your wood and leave.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.869
And sir, this is
public property.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.871
You might want to move
your dad's container.

11:02.954 --> 11:05.207
Yeah, we'll definitely
get it out of here
for you guys.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.708
Thanks a lot, fellas.
If you don't,

11:06.791 --> 11:08.544
we'll have to come back
and move it for you.

11:08.627 --> 11:10.921
All right. Enjoy your day.
You guys did a great job.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.881
Bubbles:
Free wood.

11:12.964 --> 11:14.925
That's a beautiful
speech, Randy.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.635
Only one fucking problem:

11:16.718 --> 11:18.429
you... you got
rid of them.

11:18.512 --> 11:22.266
I wasn't letting those
two hunks-of-shit hotshots

11:22.349 --> 11:24.643
take the credit for
our investigation, Mr. Lahey.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.395
Frig those shit-weasels.

11:26.478 --> 11:29.231
Oh, Randy...

11:29.314 --> 11:32.401
The game's over.
You guys gotta fucking go.

11:32.484 --> 11:34.903
Why would we
leave now, Julian?

11:34.986 --> 11:37.239
We just w... won
round number one.

11:37.322 --> 11:40.033
Where... I just can't wait
for round number two.

11:40.117 --> 11:42.578
You know what?
This isn't even fucking
worth it anymore.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.622
What?
There's not going
to be a round two.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.583
You win.
I win what?

11:47.666 --> 11:50.043
You win, Jim. I know
when I've been outsmarted

11:50.127 --> 11:52.421
and know when to walk
away, I'm fucking
walking away.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.923
You're walking away?
Congratulations, buddy.

11:55.006 --> 11:58.135
It's fucking bullshit.
Boys, let's go.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.719
What the fuck are you
talking about, man?

11:59.803 --> 12:01.472
We've got to get that shit
out of the garbage bags,

12:01.555 --> 12:03.432
it's gonna go mouldy.
I've got a plan,
get in the fucking car.

12:03.515 --> 12:04.642
Julian, what are you doing?

12:04.724 --> 12:05.976
Trust me.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.352
Get in your truck,
follow me.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.148
Ricky:
See you later, fuckfaces!

12:11.231 --> 12:13.858
Lahey:
Piece of shit. Did you get
the fucking things, Randy?

12:13.942 --> 12:16.153
Holy fuck, Randy.
This is...

12:16.236 --> 12:19.281
Hey, Randy, you forgot
to take this with you.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.992
(Engine ignition, revving)

12:22.075 --> 12:24.495
I hope you know
what the fuck
you're doing, man.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.455
Don't worry about it.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.294
Bubbles: (Whispering)
Julian, what the
fuck are we doing?

12:32.377 --> 12:33.837
Let's just go
back to the park.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.255
Hang on.

12:35.339 --> 12:36.548
What the fuck's
the plan here, man?

12:36.632 --> 12:38.133
This is fucking dumb.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.302
Fuck!
Just fucking wait,
okay? Trust me.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.471
Let's just go knock them
out and crazy-glue them.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.973
Julian:
No, just stay
right there.

12:45.056 --> 12:47.058
Fuck this. I'm going
to crazy-glue their
backs together.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.477
Don't you...
Ricky, get down!

12:48.560 --> 12:50.646
Ricky! I know what
I'm fucking doing.

12:50.729 --> 12:53.023
Bubbles:
Let's go to the park
before the cops come back.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.316
Cory:
'Sup, dudes?
Sshh!

12:54.399 --> 12:56.360
Crank on my tits.
Get the fuck down.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.987
Cory... fuck.
What's up, dude?

12:59.070 --> 13:00.822
Jacob had stage fright
and then we got lost

13:00.905 --> 13:02.324
and you guys were gone
but guess what?

13:02.407 --> 13:03.742
We followed the seagulls.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.328
And the sun.
What'd we miss?

13:06.411 --> 13:09.206
Julian:
All right, that's it. Go inside.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.333
Close that fucking door.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.584
All right, boys.
Follow me.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.172
Bubbles:
Ricky...

13:21.426 --> 13:22.969
What the fuck
are you doing?

13:23.053 --> 13:25.347
I use this shit
to wrap around my
lobster containers.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.725
You wrap it around
a bunch of times and
it's as strong as fuck.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.394
What are we going to do
with it? Wrap them like
a fucking cocoon?

13:30.477 --> 13:31.853
Yeah, something
like that.
Here, grab that.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.230
You going to try
and suffocate them?

13:33.313 --> 13:34.523
I'm not going to
suffocate them.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.066
Cory, get this
fucking thing going.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.360
All right, on my cue,
I want you guys to come over

13:38.443 --> 13:40.237
to the trailer, wrap
this shit around that trailer

13:40.320 --> 13:41.572
as many times as
you possibly can.

13:41.655 --> 13:42.906
Got it?
Cory:
Yeah, dude.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.533
You <i> got it?</i>
Yeah, yeah.

13:44.616 --> 13:45.867
Good job,
boys, good job.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.953
There you go.
Ricky, Ricky...

13:49.037 --> 13:51.456
(Ice clinking in glass)

13:54.501 --> 13:55.919
(Mouthing silently)
Bubbles: Ricky!

13:56.002 --> 13:58.380
(Whispering)
Shhh... around the windows.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.798
Ricky, what the fuck?

13:59.881 --> 14:01.132
Around the windows.

14:04.219 --> 14:06.513
Cory:
Here, dude.

14:06.597 --> 14:08.724
Bubbles, help
hold this one.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.228
Ricky:
Here, hold this, Julian.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.230
These pricks...

14:15.313 --> 14:16.523
Bubbles:
Jesus.

14:16.607 --> 14:18.734
Julian:
Stop fucking around Ricky.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.360
Ricky:
What the fuck is wrong
with this shit, man,

14:20.444 --> 14:21.779
it's not working right,
for fuck's sake!

14:21.861 --> 14:24.740
Bubbles:
Boys, hurry the fuck up.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.450
(Muffled)
What the frig is going on...

14:26.533 --> 14:28.076
Bubbles:
There's Randy.

14:28.159 --> 14:30.746
Julian:
Would you get that
thing untangled?

14:30.829 --> 14:32.247
Bubbles:
Okay, Ricky, we've got to go.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.998
Julian:
Come on, come on. Roll.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.000
Randy:
(Indistinct yelling)

14:36.084 --> 14:39.045
Ricky:
Fuck you Randy. Fuck you!

14:39.129 --> 14:40.880
Julian:
Cory, what the fuck
are you doing?

14:40.964 --> 14:42.716
Jesus, look out!
Get out of the way,
you fucking idiots!

14:42.800 --> 14:44.509
Julian: Jacob...
Ricky: Fuck.

14:44.593 --> 14:46.261
Randy:
What are we going
to fucking do?

14:46.344 --> 14:47.887
Julian:
Fuck, boys.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.931
Fuck you guys are
slow. Hurry up!

14:50.014 --> 14:52.601
Bubbles:
Ricky... boys...

14:52.684 --> 14:55.479
(Indistinct shouting
inside camper)

14:55.562 --> 14:57.355
Here he comes. Duck, duck.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.441
Jesus Christ, Ricky.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.860
It's 11:13am on the 20th.
(Indistinct shouting outside)

15:01.943 --> 15:03.612
Future officer Randy here.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.781
Myself and ex-police
officer Jim Lahey

15:05.864 --> 15:08.074
are being held
against our will.
(Clattering)

15:08.158 --> 15:11.035
Suspects are presumed
to be a one Julian,
Ricky and Bubbles,

15:11.119 --> 15:13.705
all residents of
Sunnyvale Trailer Park.

15:13.789 --> 15:14.956
Look, Randers.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.750
Liquor stash
from the old days.

15:18.376 --> 15:21.755
Right on, boys.
Open the fucking
container, buddy.

15:21.839 --> 15:23.841
Let's go.
Fucking pricks!

15:23.923 --> 15:25.843
Boys, let's go grab
some food, take a
little break maybe?

15:25.925 --> 15:27.719
I'm fucking starving.
Cory:
Yeah, dude...

15:27.803 --> 15:29.638
Julian:
We're not going to
take a fucking break.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.640
Why not?

15:31.723 --> 15:33.933
Somebody broke a piece
of wood off in the
fucking keyhole.

15:34.017 --> 15:36.687
Are you fucking kidding me?
I wonder who did that,
for fuck's sakes.

15:36.770 --> 15:39.314
Hey, Julian, why don't
you take out your tiny cock
and try to pry it out?

15:39.397 --> 15:41.692
(Chuckling)
Why don't you eat
my ass, Ricky?

15:41.775 --> 15:42.942
Fuck.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.361
Piss on it. Piss melts
wood, doesn't it?

15:44.444 --> 15:45.987
Would you shut the fuck up?

15:46.070 --> 15:47.405
Fuck!

15:47.489 --> 15:48.657
Randy:
I've tried the door

15:48.740 --> 15:50.033
and all the windows

15:50.116 --> 15:51.660
but they're all
shrink-wrapped closed.

15:51.743 --> 15:54.162
There doesn't appear
to be an exit point.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.874
I haven't been trained
for this type of situation.

15:56.956 --> 16:00.043
What's the proper
procedure, Mr .Lahey?

16:00.126 --> 16:03.338
In this situation, Randy,
one procedure fits all.

16:03.421 --> 16:04.673
Have a drink, pal.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.007
We've got to get
out of here, sir.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.551
Sshh, what's that?

16:07.634 --> 16:08.886
What are you doing?

16:08.968 --> 16:11.262
Shh...

16:11.346 --> 16:13.181
It knows what to do.

16:13.264 --> 16:14.432
What? Who?

16:14.516 --> 16:16.017
The liquor.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.102
It can think
for itself, Randy.

16:18.186 --> 16:21.189
It's just using our
minds as vesicles.

16:21.272 --> 16:25.360
Hey... a friend...
Randy...

16:25.443 --> 16:28.739
I can communicate
with the liquor, bud.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.533
It finally let me in.

16:31.616 --> 16:32.784
You're scaring me, sir.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.118
Shh...

16:34.202 --> 16:36.037
Oh, that's brilliant.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.330
It wants you to drink too,

16:37.414 --> 16:39.082
so it can
communicate with you.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.959
It's got something it
wants to tell you, bud.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.711
Please don't do
this, Mr. Lahey.

16:42.794 --> 16:45.797
Randy, you've got
the opportunity to
talk to the liquor.

16:45.881 --> 16:47.382
Take the fucking bottle.

16:54.639 --> 16:57.559
We've been given a
wonderful gift, Randy.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.644
Wonderful gift.

16:59.728 --> 17:03.732
Because the liquor
has chosen us, Randy.

17:03.815 --> 17:06.902
Me and you, bud.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.237
Fuck, it's like trying
to break into Alky-traz,
for fuck's sakes.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.906
Julian:
That's good, Bubs.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.784
That's not going
to do shit-all, man.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.119
Okay, boys. Step aside.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.790
Time to let the big dog
work his magic.

17:19.873 --> 17:22.125
Yeah, right on, Bubs.
Winch-wench it.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.294
Yeah, Ricky.
Clip that on there.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.128
Give it to her, buddy.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.256
Bubbles: I don't want to
fuck up your door,
though, Julian.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.341
Just rip it right
the fuck off, man.
I'll buy a new one.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.093
Okay, well,
stand back, boys.
(Winch whirring)

17:32.176 --> 17:34.012
This thing's going to come off
like she's packed with C-4.

17:34.095 --> 17:35.263
Here we go.

17:35.346 --> 17:38.349
(Whirring)

17:38.433 --> 17:39.935
Jacob:
I don't think it's working.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.770
Cory:
Yeah, that shit's tight.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.605
All right.
You know what?
Fuck this.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.983
No, Ricky. No, no,
wait, wait!

17:46.065 --> 17:47.818
I'm not fucking beat yet.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.653
Here, I'll get
the cocksucker off.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.030
Are you sure this
little piece of shit
has enough power?

17:52.113 --> 17:54.198
This little piece
of shit? You think
this little piece...

17:54.282 --> 17:56.117
You want to see some
fucking power, bud?

17:56.200 --> 17:59.496
You want to see
some power?
Stand fucking back!

17:59.579 --> 18:01.706
I'll show you
fucking power, baby.
Stand back, everyone.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.458
Give her hell, Bubs.

18:03.541 --> 18:06.336
I'll show you some
fucking power. Right now.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.005
Here we go.
(Banging on door)

18:08.087 --> 18:09.464
(Grunting)

18:09.547 --> 18:11.299
(Engine revving)

18:13.718 --> 18:16.805
(Screaming)
Cocksucker!

18:16.888 --> 18:18.473
Oh, Bubs,
you've fucked her.

18:18.556 --> 18:21.184
Oh, for fuck's sakes!

18:21.267 --> 18:22.602
That shouldn't
have happened!

18:22.686 --> 18:24.395
I had her
fucking on there.

18:24.479 --> 18:26.481
All right,
look the fuck out.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.149
Ricky it's..
I'll get the fucking
thing off, right now.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.526
...it's bullet-proof, man.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.819
Fuck it is.
Nothing's bulletproof.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.195
Everybody get
out of the way.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.155
(Gunshots)
Bubbles: Ricky!

18:34.238 --> 18:35.991
For fuck's sakes, Randy.

18:36.074 --> 18:38.076
They're trying
to kill us, bud!

18:38.159 --> 18:40.078
Jesus.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.538
Randy:
What are you doing?

18:41.621 --> 18:43.540
Oh, yeah.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.542
I forgot.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.877
Randy:
What are you doing, Mr. Lahey?

18:46.960 --> 18:48.545
I'm not doing anything, Randy.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.171
The liquor is.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.757
Randy:
You're not making sense.

18:52.841 --> 18:54.676
If they're going
to shoot at the liquor,

18:54.759 --> 18:56.845
the liquor's going
to return fire, Randy.

18:56.928 --> 19:00.348
Randy: The liquor can't
fire, Mr. Lahey.
(Grunt)

19:00.431 --> 19:01.850
I had this fucking thing in

19:01.933 --> 19:03.685
with 12-gauge
fucking screw holes.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.436
It shouldn't have come out.
(Grunting)
Fuck!

19:05.520 --> 19:07.731
You fucking blocky-block
metal fuckface!

19:07.814 --> 19:09.107
You're fucking
everything up!

19:09.190 --> 19:10.901
Hey, dudes, I'm not
100% sure about this

19:10.984 --> 19:12.235
but I think
I've got an idea.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.362
A what?
An idea. Check it.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.907
Oh, brilliance, Cory.
You're going to open
a military-grain lock

19:16.990 --> 19:18.366
with a fucking
toothpicker, are you?

19:18.449 --> 19:19.701
No, no, dude. I'm
making a wood-magnet

19:19.784 --> 19:21.244
so I can pull
the other wood out.

19:21.327 --> 19:24.081
A wood-magnet?
Hold on.
Check it, check it.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.541
What the fuck are
you talking about,
a wood-magnet?

19:26.624 --> 19:27.834
(Lock clicking)
Fuck.
Right on, dude!

19:27.918 --> 19:29.544
Right on, Cory.
Right on.

19:31.212 --> 19:33.882
I'm using the
liquor force, bud.

19:33.965 --> 19:35.926
(Click)

19:36.009 --> 19:37.761
You know what?
That might be

19:37.844 --> 19:39.596
the fucking
smartest dumb thing
you've ever done.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.222
Yeah, dude... Ahh!
(Gunshot)

19:41.305 --> 19:42.933
(Screaming, gunshots)
Bubbles:
Holy fuck!

19:43.016 --> 19:44.809
Cory:
Oh, God! My hand is shot!

19:44.893 --> 19:46.103
Ricky:
You all right, Cory?

19:46.185 --> 19:48.146
Future officer Randy here.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.981
Julian is officially
trying to kill us.

19:50.065 --> 19:51.942
So if anyone
finds this camera,

19:52.025 --> 19:54.736
please tell the police
to arrest Julian,
Ricky and Bubbles

19:54.819 --> 19:56.571
of Sunnyvale
for murder.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.615
Cory:
Goddamn, dude, my hand!
(Gunshots)

19:58.698 --> 20:01.451
It's gone! Oh, God!
Tell my mom I love her.
Shit, dude!

20:01.534 --> 20:03.244
Bubbles:
Cory, show me
your fucking hand.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.788
It's barely even nicked!

20:04.871 --> 20:06.915
It's hardly fucking
even bleeding!

20:06.998 --> 20:09.500
Cory, Jacob, I want
you guys to zig-zag up
to fucking Lahey's trailer,

20:09.584 --> 20:10.710
spin it around.
Huh?

20:10.794 --> 20:12.879
Spin it around?

20:12.963 --> 20:15.006
Yes, spin it around. It'll
confuse him. He won't know
where to shoot.

20:15.090 --> 20:17.425
It's like pin the tail on
on the donkey. They
already got the blindfold on.

20:17.508 --> 20:18.927
Okay, okay!
Ricky:
Let's go, boys!

20:19.010 --> 20:20.344
Cover him!
(Gunshot)

20:20.428 --> 20:22.430
(Cackling)

20:22.513 --> 20:24.891
(Continued gunshots)
(Laughing)

20:28.019 --> 20:29.646
Ricky:
Go, go, go, go!

20:29.729 --> 20:30.939
Come on!

20:31.022 --> 20:32.190
Bubbles:
Julian...

20:35.359 --> 20:38.196
Will you get the fuck
out of the way?

20:38.279 --> 20:39.656
(Continued gunshots)

20:39.739 --> 20:41.825
...get the fuck
out of the way!

20:41.908 --> 20:43.284
Here, Ricky, keep...
Look out, Ricky!

20:43.367 --> 20:45.662
Cory:
Ah shit, it got
away from us, dude.

20:45.745 --> 20:46.997
Bubbles:
Holy fuck!

20:47.080 --> 20:50.625
Randy & Lahey:
(Indistinct screaming)

20:50.708 --> 20:52.335
Jesus Murphy!

20:52.418 --> 20:53.962
Holy fuck, we've
got to call 9-1-1!

20:54.045 --> 20:55.463
We're not
calling anybody

20:55.546 --> 20:56.965
until that goddamn
weed's out of here.

20:57.048 --> 20:58.341
Let's go! Come on!

20:58.424 --> 20:59.843
Fuck them!
They tried to
fucking shoot us.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.595
Holy fuck!
Get my ratchet straps!

21:02.679 --> 21:04.848
We're on a booze
cruise, Randers.

21:04.931 --> 21:08.685
I always wanted to go
on a booze cruise, bud.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.187
Julian:
Bubs.
What?

21:10.269 --> 21:12.147
We're all packed up.
Let's go.

21:12.230 --> 21:16.359
Julian, we can't just
fucking leave them here.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.486
That's the fucking
high-tide line right there.

21:18.569 --> 21:20.446
When the water comes in,
they're going to be fucked.

21:20.530 --> 21:22.657
Julian:
You've got them tied up.
They'll be fine.

21:22.740 --> 21:25.160
Well, it's not exactly
safe, for fuck's sakes.

21:25.243 --> 21:28.663
We're leaving.
We've got to go, man.
Come on.

21:28.746 --> 21:31.374
Well, I'll be
coming back for them.

21:31.457 --> 21:32.750
Bubbles:
(Panicked whimper)

21:32.834 --> 21:35.503
(Microwave oven beeps)

21:35.586 --> 21:39.924
What a fucking tangled
heap of electrical
cocksuckers.

21:40.008 --> 21:42.177
Boys, you can't
fucking do this.

21:42.260 --> 21:44.679
Do you know how
many levels this
is wrong on, Ricky?

21:44.762 --> 21:46.389
Bubs, it's level enough.
All the crystal's
coming through.

21:46.472 --> 21:47.891
It's working
fucking perfect.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.726
Ricky, I'm not talking
about the angle

21:49.809 --> 21:52.436
of your fucking
home-made THC sifter.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.855
Well, there's no
turning back now.

21:53.938 --> 21:55.439
We've got to go
for broke here, okay?

21:55.523 --> 21:56.691
Just keep
reminding yourself

21:56.774 --> 21:58.317
why the fuck
we're doing this.

21:58.401 --> 22:00.361
Okay. Well, I would
just like to state
for the record,

22:00.444 --> 22:03.907
this is hands-down
the most fucked-up thing
you guys have ever done.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.409
No, it's not.
(Mixed chatter of kids)

22:06.492 --> 22:10.205
How's it going, kids?
You guys are doing perfect.

22:10.288 --> 22:13.291
Oh, yeah. Look at
all that crystal.
Good job, guys.

22:13.374 --> 22:15.710
Oh, Lord Jesus
and Baby Marion.

22:15.793 --> 22:17.212
All right, switch it
up down there.

22:17.295 --> 22:18.963
Let's work on our slapshots
for a bit, guys.

22:19.047 --> 22:21.340
Kids:
â™ª ...crystal off
the fucking weed â™ª

22:21.424 --> 22:25.386
(Cellphone ringing)
â™ª Weed, weed, weed... â™ª

22:25.469 --> 22:26.888
Fuck, it's fucking Snoop.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.223
Snoop?
How do I answer
this again?

22:28.306 --> 22:29.640
Just... There.
Press that button.

22:29.724 --> 22:33.352
This one?
No, that one
right there.

22:33.436 --> 22:35.897
Hey, Snoop, how's it
going, brother?
Hey, man, how are ya?

22:35.980 --> 22:38.191
<i>Not good, muthafuckas.</i>
<i>Deal's off.</i>

22:38.275 --> 22:39.901
What? You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.237
What the fuck
are you talking about?

22:42.320 --> 22:45.115
<i>Look, man. Shit just</i>
<i>fell through. Wasn't</i>
<i>nothing I could do.</i>

22:45.198 --> 22:46.908
Do you know what the fuck
we just went through

22:46.991 --> 22:48.576
to meet your
fucking choda?

22:48.659 --> 22:51.079
I gave up everything for
this fucking deal, man.

22:51.162 --> 22:52.830
<i>No, I'm just fucking</i>
<i>with y'all, cuz.</i>

22:52.914 --> 22:54.916
Fuck. You bastard.
<i>I'm just calling</i>

22:54.999 --> 22:56.960
<i>to make sure everything</i>
<i>is still on track.</i>

22:57.043 --> 22:59.296
We had a couple of
setbacks but yeah, man,
we're all good now.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.923
<i>What kind of setbacks?</i>
<i>Lahey fucking with you?</i>

23:02.006 --> 23:03.424
Well, he was but
he's probably dead.

23:03.507 --> 23:04.717
I think we just
fucking killed him.

23:04.801 --> 23:06.636
<i>For real?</i>
Yeah.

23:06.719 --> 23:09.097
<i>Y'all killed that mothafucka?</i>
No, no, Snoop, no, no.

23:09.180 --> 23:11.349
Ricky's just fucking
with you the way
that, you know,

23:11.432 --> 23:13.226
you were fucking
with him.

23:13.310 --> 23:15.770
Lahey's just, uh...
they're going camping,
him and Randy.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.272
Yeah, everything's set
on our end, man.

23:17.355 --> 23:18.606
Everything's bottled
and ready to go.

23:18.689 --> 23:20.066
<i>Dig this:</i>

23:20.150 --> 23:22.152
<i>tomorrow my homeboy,</i>
<i>Sammy Ogea,</i>

23:22.235 --> 23:23.945
<i>he gonna get with y'all.</i>

23:24.028 --> 23:25.947
<i>Then we can make</i>
<i>motherfuckin' history.</i>

23:26.030 --> 23:27.282
Fucking awesome.

23:27.365 --> 23:28.699
Right on.
Cheers, man.

23:28.783 --> 23:31.244
Peace.
(Happy grunts)

23:31.328 --> 23:33.913
Boys, we've got to
start bottling this
shit immediately.

23:33.997 --> 23:35.290
It looks like we're
pulling an all-nighter.

23:35.373 --> 23:37.458
No, we need to go down
and let Lahey and Randy

23:37.541 --> 23:39.085
out of that fucking
death-trap.

23:39.169 --> 23:40.378
Bubs, they'll be fine.

23:40.461 --> 23:41.796
They're tied up
nice and good, okay?

23:41.879 --> 23:43.340
We'll let them out as soon
as this deal's done.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.300
Let's get back to work.

23:45.383 --> 23:47.969
Ricky: Jacob, get some
more fucking weed
on the trampoline.

23:48.052 --> 23:49.929
Look who's squirming
now, Lahey.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.142
Julian's attempt to drown us
like a couple of rats

23:54.225 --> 23:56.060
has so far been unsuccessful.

23:56.144 --> 23:58.021
The camper appears
to be watertight.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.981
We still can't get
a cellphone reception

24:00.064 --> 24:02.650
but I'm going to continue
to try and contact the police.

24:02.733 --> 24:07.697
Randy, the ol' shitliner
seems pretty fucking
seaworthy, eh, bud?

24:07.780 --> 24:10.325
(Harmonica playing)

24:10.408 --> 24:12.369
(Gunshot)
Holy fuck!

24:12.451 --> 24:14.704
Randy:
Oh, my God.
Forget what I said.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.289
We're officially
sinking.

24:16.373 --> 24:17.665
We've got to get
out of here, Mr. Lahey!

24:17.748 --> 24:19.458
We're going to die.

24:19.542 --> 24:24.214
A liquor captain never abandons
a sinking shit-ship, Randy.

24:24.297 --> 24:27.050
Randy:
But Mr. Lahey, you're not
a frigging liquor captain,

24:27.133 --> 24:30.178
you're a trailer
park supervisor
and this is a camper.

24:30.261 --> 24:31.929
It's not even a ship,
for frig's sakes.

24:32.013 --> 24:33.431
We gotta get out of here!

24:33.514 --> 24:35.558
(Water splashing)

24:35.641 --> 24:36.893
Arrrr!

24:36.976 --> 24:40.271
(Theme music)

25:19.977 --> 25:23.689
(Seabirds squawking)

25:35.326 --> 25:39.080
Fish:
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

25:39.163 --> 25:42.208
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

25:46.003 --> 25:47.255
(Whisper)
<i>Fuck.</i>

25:47.338 --> 25:49.466
(Light clicks off)
<i>Fuck off.</i>
