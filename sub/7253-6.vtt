22:45.906 --> 22:47.741
PICKING OUT CHINA PATTERNS

22:45.906 --> 22:47.741
WITH EMILY.

22:51.787 --> 22:52.955
OH! STARVED!

22:52.997 --> 22:54.414
YOU'RE ALWAYS STARVED.

22:54.456 --> 22:56.209
NOW, I'M "CRASH-LANDED

22:54.456 --> 22:56.209
IN THE ANDES,

22:56.250 --> 22:57.626
EAT MY TEAMMATES" STARVED.

22:57.668 --> 22:59.128
I'LL BE BACK IN AN HOUR.

22:59.170 --> 23:00.420
NO.

23:00.462 --> 23:03.549
MM-HMM. THREE MORE PACKAGES,

23:00.462 --> 23:03.549
ALL FOR YOU.

23:03.590 --> 23:06.802
WHERE IS ALL THIS

23:03.590 --> 23:06.802
STUPID STUFF COMING FROM?

23:06.844 --> 23:10.264
LOOKS LIKE CLASSIC

23:06.844 --> 23:10.264
HOME SHOPPING CHANNEL TO ME.

23:10.306 --> 23:12.141
I HAVE NOT BOUGHT ANYTHING

23:10.306 --> 23:12.141
OFF THE HOME SHOPPING CHANNEL.

23:12.183 --> 23:13.391
THAT YOU REMEMBER.

23:13.433 --> 23:14.810
HOW COULD I NOT REMEMBER?

23:14.852 --> 23:16.603
YOU COULD BE

23:14.852 --> 23:16.603
DELUDING YOURSELF,

23:16.645 --> 23:19.606
SUPPRESSING A SHAMEFUL, COSTLY,

23:16.645 --> 23:19.606
AND EXTREMELY TACKY

23:19.648 --> 23:21.608
SHOPPING ADDICTION

23:19.648 --> 23:21.608
FROM YOUR MEMORY.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.611
I DO NOT HAVE A HOME SHOPPING

23:21.650 --> 23:24.611
CHANNEL ADDICTION.

23:24.653 --> 23:27.614
THIS DOES LOOK FAMILIAR,

23:24.653 --> 23:27.614
LIKE I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE.

23:27.656 --> 23:30.492
WAS JOAN RIVERS

23:27.656 --> 23:30.492
OR SUZANNE SOMERS HOLDING IT UP?

23:30.534 --> 23:32.036
I'M NOT BUYING

23:30.534 --> 23:32.036
THESE THINGS.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.913
YOU KEEP

23:32.078 --> 23:33.913
TELLING YOURSELF THAT.

23:33.954 --> 23:36.582
KIRK IS IN THE DINING ROOM,

23:33.954 --> 23:36.582
WANTING TO SPEAK TO YOU.

23:36.623 --> 23:38.292
MUST BE ABOUT

23:36.623 --> 23:38.292
THE STREET NAME.

23:38.334 --> 23:41.170
CAN YOU CONTAIN YOUR PERSONAL

23:38.334 --> 23:41.170
DEMONS LONG ENOUGH TO FACE HIM,

23:41.212 --> 23:42.504
OR SHALL I SEND HIM AWAY?

23:42.546 --> 23:43.923
ENOUGH, MICHEL.

23:43.964 --> 23:47.218
IT'S NEVER ENOUGH.

23:43.964 --> 23:47.218
THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

23:49.262 --> 23:50.221
LORELAI, HELLO.

23:50.263 --> 23:51.222
HELLO, KIRK.

23:51.264 --> 23:52.306
HAVE A SEAT.

23:52.348 --> 23:53.849
I'M PLEASED TO INFORM YOU

23:53.891 --> 23:56.185
THAT THE STARS HOLLOW

23:53.891 --> 23:56.185
BOARD OF TOURISM

23:56.227 --> 23:58.771
HAS GRACIOUSLY DECIDED

23:56.227 --> 23:58.771
TO OFFER YOU A PROPOSAL.

23:58.812 --> 24:01.190
GREAT. I APPRECIATE IT.

23:58.812 --> 24:01.190
WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR ME?

24:01.232 --> 24:02.983
YOU CAN CHOOSE

24:01.232 --> 24:02.983
ANY OF THREE

24:03.025 --> 24:04.985
HISTORICALLY ANCHORED

24:03.025 --> 24:04.985
STREET NAMES

24:05.027 --> 24:07.196
THAT PRE-DATED

24:05.027 --> 24:07.196
SORES AND BOILS ALLEY.

24:07.238 --> 24:08.239
IT'S A GENEROUS PROPOSAL.

24:08.281 --> 24:09.615
LET'S HEAR THEM.

24:09.656 --> 24:12.243
THE FIRST ONE

24:09.656 --> 24:12.243
IS CONSTABULARY ROAD.

24:12.285 --> 24:13.327
CONSTABULARY ROAD.

24:13.369 --> 24:14.912
IT'S A VERY NICE NAME.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.290
CLASSIC. VERY EVOCATIVE

24:14.954 --> 24:17.290
OF OLD-TIME STARS HOLLOW.

24:17.331 --> 24:18.958
YES, IT'S VERY NICE,

24:18.999 --> 24:21.043
BUT THAT'S THE EXACT NAME

24:18.999 --> 24:21.043
OF ESTHER WILKINS' STREET.

24:21.085 --> 24:24.004
I MEAN, THE EXACT NAME.

24:21.085 --> 24:24.004
IT'S TAKEN.

24:24.046 --> 24:25.589
AT ONE TIME,

24:24.046 --> 24:25.589
THERE WERE SEVERAL STREETS

24:25.631 --> 24:27.674
NAMED CONSTABULARY ROAD.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.302
THAT WOULD BE

24:27.716 --> 24:29.302
INCREDIBLY CONFUSING.

24:29.343 --> 24:31.929
OH, IT WOULD BE A DISASTER.

24:29.343 --> 24:31.929
IT WAS BACK THEN, TOO.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.472
MAIL WAS MIS-DELIVERED.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.472
SOLDIERS LOST THEIR WAY.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.892
IT COMPLETELY DISORIENTED

24:34.514 --> 24:36.892
SENIOR CITIZENS.

24:36.934 --> 24:39.312
THERE WAS RIOTING, CHAOS, DEATH.

24:36.934 --> 24:39.312
EVERYONE HATED IT.

24:39.353 --> 24:40.687
WHAT'S NUMBER TWO?

24:40.729 --> 24:42.273
NUMBER TWO --

24:42.315 --> 24:44.400
CHARGOGGAGOGGMANCHAUGGAGOGG-

24:42.315 --> 24:44.400
CHAUBUNAGUNGAMAUGG.

24:44.442 --> 24:45.651
CHARGOGGA-WHAT?

24:45.692 --> 24:47.111
AN OLD NIPMUCK INDIAN NAME.

24:47.153 --> 24:49.280
MEANS "YOU FISH

24:47.153 --> 24:49.280
ON YOUR SIDE OF THE LAKE,

24:49.322 --> 24:51.740
I'LL FISH ON MY SIDE,

24:49.322 --> 24:51.740
NO ONE FISHES IN THE MIDDLE."

24:51.782 --> 24:53.117
OR MAYBE

24:51.782 --> 24:53.117
IT MEANS "BUFFALO."

24:53.159 --> 24:54.660
IT'S UNPRONOUNCEABLE.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.660
NEXT.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.829
FROM 1768,

24:54.701 --> 24:56.829
SOMETHING FLAVORFUL.

24:56.870 --> 24:57.997
CRUSTY BULGE.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.290
OH, COME ON!

24:59.332 --> 25:00.874
IS THAT A NO?

25:00.916 --> 25:03.210
YES, THAT'S A NO. THESE ARE

25:00.916 --> 25:03.210
NOT LEGITIMATE CHOICES.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.670
TAYLOR THINKS THEY ARE.

25:04.711 --> 25:07.089
TAYLOR'S WRONG.

25:04.711 --> 25:07.089
THE DRAGONFLY IS A BUSINESS.

25:07.131 --> 25:08.924
WE NEED

25:07.131 --> 25:08.924
A CREDIBLE STREET NAME.

25:08.966 --> 25:11.427
I TELL YOU WHAT --

25:08.966 --> 25:11.427
WE'RE KEEPING THIRD STREET.

25:11.469 --> 25:13.095
TAYLOR IS NOT

25:11.469 --> 25:13.095
GONNA LIKE THAT.

25:13.137 --> 25:15.513
WELL, TOO BAD,

25:13.137 --> 25:15.513
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.

25:15.555 --> 25:18.017
DECISION MADE.

25:15.555 --> 25:18.017
IT'S NOT GONNA BE CRUSTY BULGE.

25:18.058 --> 25:20.978
IT'S NOT GONNA BE AN INDIAN

25:18.058 --> 25:20.978
NAME NO ONE CAN PRONOUNCE.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.897
IT'S NOT GONNA BE A NAME

25:21.020 --> 25:23.897
THAT 50,000 OTHER PEOPLE HAD

25:23.939 --> 25:26.359
THAT CAUSED MASS CHAOS

25:23.939 --> 25:26.359
AND DEATH IN 1492.

25:26.400 --> 25:29.527
OH, MY GOD. I JUST REALIZED

25:26.400 --> 25:29.527
WHERE ALL THAT STUFF IS FROM.

25:29.569 --> 25:30.696
WHAT STUFF?

25:30.737 --> 25:32.281
JUST TELL TAYLOR

25:30.737 --> 25:32.281
WHAT I SAID.

25:32.323 --> 25:33.366
SO WE'RE DONE HERE?

25:33.407 --> 25:34.783
DEFINITELY.

25:34.825 --> 25:38.287
THANK GOD.

25:34.825 --> 25:38.287
MOM TIED THIS WAY TOO TIGHT.

25:38.329 --> 25:40.122
[ KNOCK ON DOOR ]

25:43.417 --> 25:44.377
AM I DISTURBING?

25:44.418 --> 25:45.627
NO, COME ON IN.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.296
RORY,

25:45.669 --> 25:47.296
THIS IS EDGAR PULLINGS.

25:47.338 --> 25:49.756
HE INSTALLED THE INTERCOM

25:47.338 --> 25:49.756
46 YEARS AGO.

25:49.798 --> 25:51.925
NICE TO MEET YOU.

25:51.967 --> 25:54.220
SHE SAID,

25:51.967 --> 25:54.220
"NICE TO MEET YOU"!

25:54.261 --> 25:56.138
OH, NICE TO MEET YOU,

25:54.261 --> 25:56.138
YOUNG LADY.

25:56.180 --> 25:57.931
HE CALLS<i> ME</i> THAT, TOO.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.933
IT'S RIGHT IN THERE,

25:57.973 --> 25:59.933
EDGAR!

25:59.975 --> 26:01.935
OKAY,

25:59.975 --> 26:01.935
I'LL HAVE A LOOK-SEE.

26:01.977 --> 26:04.146
YOU JUST HOLLER

26:01.977 --> 26:04.146
WHEN YOU'RE SITUATED,

26:04.188 --> 26:06.148
AND I'LL BRING IN

26:04.188 --> 26:06.148
YOUR TOOLBOX!

26:06.190 --> 26:08.942
IF YOU'RE FEELING FAINT

26:06.190 --> 26:08.942
OR NEED A GLASS OF WATER,

26:08.984 --> 26:12.154
DON'T BE SHY!

26:12.196 --> 26:14.365
I'M SORRY

26:12.196 --> 26:14.365
FOR THE SHORT NOTICE.

26:14.407 --> 26:15.533
I FIGURED I'D BETTER

26:14.407 --> 26:15.533
GET HIM OVER HERE

26:15.573 --> 26:17.243
BEFORE HE...RETIRES.

26:17.284 --> 26:20.079
NO, IT'S GREAT.

26:17.284 --> 26:20.079
THANK YOU.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.872
EVERYTHING ELSE AROUND HERE

26:20.120 --> 26:21.872
UP TO SNUFF?

26:21.914 --> 26:22.998
ARE THE SHEETS

26:21.914 --> 26:22.998
BEING OVER-IRONED?

26:23.040 --> 26:24.542
NO, THEY'RE PERFECT.

26:24.582 --> 26:26.335
'CAUSE THAT'S

26:24.582 --> 26:26.335
NOT AN URBAN LEGEND.

26:26.377 --> 26:29.338
IF SHEETS HAVE A HIGH THREAD

26:26.377 --> 26:29.338
COUNT, THEY CAN BE OVER-IRONED.

26:29.380 --> 26:31.549
GRANDMA, UM,

26:29.380 --> 26:31.549
CAN I ASK A FAVOR?

26:31.589 --> 26:33.092
OF COURSE.

26:33.133 --> 26:36.345
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD

26:33.133 --> 26:36.345
SPEAK WITH GRANDPA FOR ME.

26:36.387 --> 26:38.180
ABOUT WHAT?

26:38.222 --> 26:39.765
LAST NIGHT,

26:39.806 --> 26:43.185
WHEN HE HAD THE NIGHTCAP

26:39.806 --> 26:43.185
WITH LOGAN,

26:43.227 --> 26:44.978
HE SAID SOME THINGS

26:45.020 --> 26:47.064
THAT MADE LOGAN

26:45.020 --> 26:47.064
A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.774
WHAT KIND OF THINGS?

26:48.815 --> 26:52.570
JUST THINGS ABOUT OUR FUTURE --

26:48.815 --> 26:52.570
LOGAN'S AND MINE.

26:52.610 --> 26:53.862
I THINK GRANDPA WANTED

26:52.610 --> 26:53.862
TO FIND OUT

26:53.904 --> 26:55.030
IF WE WERE

26:53.904 --> 26:55.030
GETTING MARRIED.

26:55.072 --> 26:56.365
WHAT?!

26:56.407 --> 26:58.616
THE THING IS,

26:56.407 --> 26:58.616
WE'RE YOUNG.

26:58.658 --> 27:00.786
WE HAVEN'T BEEN GOING OUT

26:58.658 --> 27:00.786
FOR THAT LONG.

27:00.827 --> 27:03.456
IT'S TOO SOON FOR US TO BE

27:00.827 --> 27:03.456
THINKING ABOUT GETTING SERIOUS.

27:03.497 --> 27:06.166
OF COURSE IT IS. YOUR

27:03.497 --> 27:06.166
GRANDFATHER SHOULD KNOW BETTER.

27:06.208 --> 27:07.834
DON'T YOU WORRY.

27:06.208 --> 27:07.834
I'LL CLEAR THIS UP WITH HIM.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.462
THANK YOU, GRANDMA.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.462
MY PLEASURE.

27:09.503 --> 27:12.714
NOW THAT THAT'S TAKEN CARE OF,

27:09.503 --> 27:12.714
JUST BETWEEN US GIRLS,

27:12.756 --> 27:15.134
HOW ARE THINGS GOING

27:12.756 --> 27:15.134
BETWEEN YOU TWO?

27:15.175 --> 27:17.511
WELL...THEY'RE GREAT.

27:17.553 --> 27:19.179
LOGAN'S VERY NICE.

27:19.221 --> 27:22.182
HE BOUGHT ME THIS GIFT

27:19.221 --> 27:22.182
JUST COMPLETELY OUT OF THE BLUE.

27:22.224 --> 27:23.892
IS THAT SO?

27:23.934 --> 27:25.519
IT'S CALLED

27:23.934 --> 27:25.519
A "BIRKIN BAG."

27:25.561 --> 27:27.229
A BIRKIN BAG?

27:27.271 --> 27:28.981
OH, MY GOD.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.648
A<i> BIRKIN</i> BAG.

27:30.690 --> 27:31.733
YOU'VE HEARD OF IT?

27:31.775 --> 27:32.943
OF COURSE.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.154
THAT'S A<i> VERY</i> NICE PURSE.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.239
OH. MAYBE

27:35.195 --> 27:37.239
I SHOULDN'T USE IT.

27:37.281 --> 27:40.326
OH, NO. A BIRKIN BAG IS MEANT

27:37.281 --> 27:40.326
TO BE USED...AND SEEN.

27:40.367 --> 27:41.577
I HAD NO IDEA.

27:41.619 --> 27:45.122
WELL, WELL, WELL.

27:41.619 --> 27:45.122
A BIRKIN BAG.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.291
A BIRKIN BAG.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.291
A BIRKIN BAG FOR RORY.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.126
GRANDMA.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.836
I'M JUST SAYING.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.836
RICHARD NEVER BOUGHT<i> ME </i>

27:49.168 --> 27:50.836
A BIRKIN BAG.

27:50.877 --> 27:52.004
THIS IS EXCITING!

27:52.045 --> 27:53.380
I GUESS IT IS.

27:53.422 --> 27:57.092
A BIRKIN BAG.

27:53.422 --> 27:57.092
I'M GONNA REMEMBER THIS DAY.

27:57.134 --> 28:00.095
UM...IT'S BEEN

27:57.134 --> 28:00.095
VERY QUIET IN THERE.

28:00.137 --> 28:02.181
HUH?

28:02.222 --> 28:03.182
OH, DEAR.

28:03.223 --> 28:04.682
EDGAR?

28:04.724 --> 28:06.644
EDGAR! EDGAR!

28:08.228 --> 28:10.439
OH, MY GOD. I MADE IT.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.439
FOOD, ME, GIVE.

28:10.481 --> 28:11.982
EMERGENCY B.L.T.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.401
EMERGENCY CHILI FRIES

28:12.024 --> 28:14.401
AND A BLACK-AND-WHITE SHAKE.

28:14.443 --> 28:16.195
IT'S A THREE-ALARM

28:14.443 --> 28:16.195
EMERGENCY.

28:16.236 --> 28:18.197
SOMETHING CAME FOR YOU

28:16.236 --> 28:18.197
EARLY THIS MORNING.

28:18.238 --> 28:19.990
GOOD OLD CEASER

28:18.238 --> 28:19.990
SIGNED FOR IT.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.283
OH, MY GOD!

28:21.325 --> 28:23.202
NORMALLY,

28:21.325 --> 28:23.202
I HAVE A BLANKET POLICY

28:23.243 --> 28:25.787
AGAINST THE DINER

28:23.243 --> 28:25.787
ACCEPTING HUMONGOUS 5-FOOT URNS

28:25.829 --> 28:27.331
ADDRESSED TO OTHER PEOPLE,

28:25.829 --> 28:27.331
BUT I WAS AT THE MARKET,

28:27.373 --> 28:30.876
AND CEASER DIDN'T KNOW

28:27.373 --> 28:30.876
ABOUT THE POLICY.

28:30.917 --> 28:33.753
OH, SHE IS GOOD --

28:30.917 --> 28:33.753
COVERING ALL THE BASES.

28:30.917 --> 28:33.753
WHO?

28:33.795 --> 28:36.423
SENDING IT HERE.

28:33.795 --> 28:36.423
BRILLIANT. PICKING AWAY

28:33.795 --> 28:36.423
AT THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO ME.

28:36.465 --> 28:37.715
WHO IS THIS?

28:37.757 --> 28:39.593
EMILY GILMORE.

28:37.757 --> 28:39.593
YOU'RE KIDDING!

28:39.635 --> 28:42.804
SHE'S BEEN SENDING ME EVERYTHING

28:39.635 --> 28:42.804
SHE DOESN'T NEED ANYMORE,

28:42.846 --> 28:44.890
TRYING TO SMOKE ME

28:42.846 --> 28:44.890
OUT OF MY FOXHOLE.

28:44.931 --> 28:46.850
CALL HER AND TELL HER

28:44.931 --> 28:46.850
TO KNOCK IT OFF.

28:46.892 --> 28:49.311
OH, NO. THAT'S EXACTLY

28:46.892 --> 28:49.311
WHAT SHE WANTS.

28:49.353 --> 28:51.771
I POKE MY HEAD OUT,

28:49.353 --> 28:51.771
IT GETS BLOWN OFF.

28:51.813 --> 28:53.023
THEN I HAVE NO HEAD, LUKE.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.150
THERE'S A GIANT URN

28:53.065 --> 28:55.150
IN MY DINER.

28:55.192 --> 28:57.152
IT STARTED SMALL --

28:55.192 --> 28:57.152
A CLOCK, BIRDCAGE,

28:57.194 --> 28:58.862
SOME VICTORIAN FIGURINES,

28:57.194 --> 28:58.862
AN OLD TELESCOPE.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.198
THAT WAS THE GROUND WAR.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.198
SHE WAS SOFTENING ME UP.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.159
NOW COMES THE AERIAL CAMPAIGN.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.159
THE CARPET BOMBING.

29:04.201 --> 29:06.161
I BET SHE'LL BOMB ME

29:04.201 --> 29:06.161
WITH ACTUAL CARPETS.

29:06.203 --> 29:08.539
CALL HER.

29:06.203 --> 29:08.539
YOU MEAN, SURRENDER?

29:06.203 --> 29:08.539
NEVER.

29:08.581 --> 29:11.875
SHE'S GONNA KEEP SENDING

29:08.581 --> 29:11.875
YOU STUFF, SENDING<i> ME</i> STUFF.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.336
SHE'LL RUN OUT OF STUFF.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.336
SHE'LL BUY MORE STUFF.

29:14.378 --> 29:17.256
SHE'LL RUN OUT OF MONEY.

29:14.378 --> 29:17.256
SHE'S GOT ENDLESS MONEY.

29:17.297 --> 29:19.966
MY MOM HAS A BLACK BELT

29:17.297 --> 29:19.966
IN PASSIVE AGGRESSION.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.260
THERE IS NO COUNTER

29:20.008 --> 29:21.260
TO THIS MOVE,

29:21.301 --> 29:23.220
WHICH MEANS

29:21.301 --> 29:23.220
I AM NOT GOING TO COUNTER.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.764
I CAN'T HAVE A GIANT URN

29:23.262 --> 29:25.764
SITTING IN MY RESTAURANT.

29:25.805 --> 29:27.266
ACTUALLY,

29:25.805 --> 29:27.266
IT'S MORE OF A VASE.

29:27.307 --> 29:29.435
I DON'T CARE.

29:27.307 --> 29:29.435
THE THING WEIGHS 300 POUNDS.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.853
CEASER SAID IT TOOK FOUR GUYS

29:29.476 --> 29:31.853
TO BRING IT IN.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.021
IT DOES KIND OF

29:31.895 --> 29:33.021
SPRUCE UP THE PLACE.

29:33.063 --> 29:34.940
IT GOES TODAY.

29:34.981 --> 29:39.111
OKAY, I'LL WORK ON FIGURING OUT

29:34.981 --> 29:39.111
HOW TO GET IT OUT OF HERE.

29:39.152 --> 29:41.113
I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY

29:39.152 --> 29:41.113
ONE OF A MATCHING PAIR.

29:43.699 --> 29:44.658
YOU BUSY?

29:44.700 --> 29:46.868
NOT TOO.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.537
RORY HAD A LITTLE TALK

29:46.910 --> 29:48.537
WITH ME TODAY

29:48.579 --> 29:49.829
I THOUGHT

29:48.579 --> 29:49.829
I'D SHARE WITH YOU.

29:49.871 --> 29:51.039
OH? WHAT ABOUT?

29:51.081 --> 29:52.374
ABOUT LOGAN,

29:51.081 --> 29:52.374
ABOUT SOMETHING YOU SAID.

29:52.416 --> 29:53.959
IT'S BEEN HANDLED.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.586
SOMETHING I SAID?

29:54.000 --> 29:55.586
WHEN?

29:55.628 --> 29:57.588
HE'S FINE. SHE'S FINE.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.588
THEY'RE FINE.

29:57.630 --> 29:58.797
<i>VERY</i> FINE.

29:58.838 --> 30:00.966
LOGAN BOUGHT HER

29:58.838 --> 30:00.966
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL

30:01.007 --> 30:03.093
AND PRESTIGIOUS HANDBAG

30:01.007 --> 30:03.093
IN THE WORLD.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.053
A HANDBAG?

30:03.135 --> 30:05.053
A BIRKIN BAG.

30:05.095 --> 30:07.389
I'VE SHOWN YOU PICTURES BEFORE,

30:05.095 --> 30:07.389
AROUND MY BIRTHDAY?

30:07.431 --> 30:08.641
SO SOPHISTICATED.

30:08.682 --> 30:10.142
NOW WE KNOW OUR WORRIES

30:10.183 --> 30:12.311
ABOUT SHIRA MESSING WITH THINGS

30:10.183 --> 30:12.311
WERE UNFOUNDED.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.313
THEY ARE DOING VERY WELL.

30:14.354 --> 30:15.897
YES, THAT'S FINE, EMILY.

30:15.939 --> 30:18.150
BUT WHAT DID I SAY

30:15.939 --> 30:18.150
THAT CAUSED A PROBLEM?

30:18.191 --> 30:20.068
YOU SCARED THE POOR BOY

30:18.191 --> 30:20.068
HALF TO DEATH

30:20.110 --> 30:21.487
DURING THAT NIGHTCAP

30:20.110 --> 30:21.487
OF YOURS.

30:21.528 --> 30:22.862
HOW?

30:22.904 --> 30:25.157
YOUR INTENTIONS SPEECH

30:22.904 --> 30:25.157
WAS SO OUT OF THE BLUE.

30:25.198 --> 30:26.825
MY INTENTIONS SPEECH.

30:25.198 --> 30:26.825
I'M NOT FOLLOWING.

30:26.866 --> 30:28.327
INTENTIONS ABOUT WHAT?

30:28.368 --> 30:30.579
REALLY, YOU'RE ALWAYS

30:28.368 --> 30:30.579
A HALF STEP BEHIND.

30:30.621 --> 30:32.790
BECAUSE YOU TELL ME THINGS

30:30.621 --> 30:32.790
IN DRIPS AND DRABS.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.207
WHAT DOES SHE THINK I SAID?

30:34.249 --> 30:36.627
YOU ASKED WHEN HE WAS

30:34.249 --> 30:36.627
GOING TO PROPOSE.

30:36.669 --> 30:38.837
I ASKED HIM

30:36.669 --> 30:38.837
NOTHING OF THE SORT!

30:38.878 --> 30:41.298
WE WERE JUST CHATTING,

30:38.878 --> 30:41.298
SHOOTING THE BREEZE.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.550
LOGAN VIEWED IT

30:41.340 --> 30:43.550
AS AN INTERROGATION

30:43.592 --> 30:45.177
ABOUT HIS AND RORY'S

30:43.592 --> 30:45.177
FUTURE.

30:45.218 --> 30:46.845
THE BOY MISUNDERSTOOD.

30:46.886 --> 30:48.972
I WASN'T TALKING

30:46.886 --> 30:48.972
ABOUT<i> THEIR</i> FUTURE.

30:49.014 --> 30:51.141
I WAS TALKING --

30:49.014 --> 30:51.141
IT WAS SCOTCH TALK.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.102
I WOULD NEVER DREAM OF

30:51.183 --> 30:54.102
INTERROGATING HIM LIKE THAT.

30:54.144 --> 30:56.146
I'LL APOLOGIZE TO HIM

30:54.144 --> 30:56.146
THE NEXT TIME I SEE HIM.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.648
AND TO RORY.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.648
GOOD.

30:57.690 --> 30:59.274
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

30:59.316 --> 31:01.777
THOSE TWO ARE TOO YOUNG

30:59.316 --> 31:01.777
TO BE THINKING ABOUT MARRIAGE.

31:01.819 --> 31:02.902
THEY JUST MET EACH OTHER.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.363
IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR.

31:04.404 --> 31:06.114
IT HASN'T BEEN A YEAR.

31:04.404 --> 31:06.114
THEY'RE BABIES.

31:06.156 --> 31:07.533
BABIES?

31:07.574 --> 31:10.076
RICHARD, YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER

31:07.574 --> 31:10.076
IS ABOUT TO TURN 21.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.537
IF THEY DID GET ENGAGED,

31:11.578 --> 31:13.913
THE CEREMONY WOULD BE NEXT YEAR

31:11.578 --> 31:13.913
OR THE YEAR AFTER.

31:13.955 --> 31:14.956
THAT MAKES HER 23.

31:14.998 --> 31:16.500
AND TOO YOUNG.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.711
IT'S THE SAME AGE I WAS.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.711
I WASN'T TOO YOUNG.

31:18.752 --> 31:20.504
WE WERE DIFFERENT.

31:18.752 --> 31:20.504
HOW?

31:20.546 --> 31:23.382
WE'RE US, AND RORY'S RORY.

31:20.546 --> 31:23.382
SHE HAS THINGS TO DO.

31:23.423 --> 31:24.842
I DON'T KNOW WHY

31:23.423 --> 31:24.842
YOU'RE SO WORKED UP ABOUT THIS.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.385
THEY AREN'T ENGAGED.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.385
GOOD.

31:26.426 --> 31:27.969
WHAT WAS YOUR TALK

31:26.426 --> 31:27.969
WITH LOGAN ABOUT?

31:28.011 --> 31:30.556
I WAS JUST CURIOUS ABOUT

31:28.011 --> 31:30.556
WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH RORY.

31:30.597 --> 31:32.474
SHE CAN BE

31:30.597 --> 31:32.474
EXTREMELY TACITURN.

31:32.516 --> 31:34.059
WHAT ARE YOU

31:32.516 --> 31:34.059
SO CURIOUS ABOUT?

31:34.100 --> 31:36.228
THE GIRL SPENDS ALL HER TIME

31:34.100 --> 31:36.228
IN THAT POOL HOUSE.

31:36.269 --> 31:39.022
SHE'S SO SECRETIVE.

31:36.269 --> 31:39.022
AREN'T YOU CURIOUS?

31:39.064 --> 31:42.234
IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT'S

31:39.064 --> 31:42.234
GOING ON IN A GIRL'S LIFE,

31:42.275 --> 31:44.611
YOU CERTAINLY DON'T TALK

31:42.275 --> 31:44.611
TO HER BOYFRIEND.

31:44.653 --> 31:45.821
FOLLOW ME.

31:45.863 --> 31:47.239
WHY? WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

31:47.280 --> 31:48.532
FOLLOW ME.

31:50.826 --> 31:51.910
EMILY, IS SHE HOME?

31:51.951 --> 31:53.662
NO, SHE'S OUT.

31:53.704 --> 31:55.873
I WOULDN'T BURST IN HERE

31:53.704 --> 31:55.873
LIKE THIS IF SHE WERE HOME.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.916
WE SHOULD NOT BE HERE.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.916
THIS IS PROWLING.

31:57.957 --> 32:00.711
YOU CAN'T PROWL

31:57.957 --> 32:00.711
IN YOUR OWN HOUSE.

32:00.753 --> 32:02.003
THIS IS CALLED

32:00.753 --> 32:02.003
"SHOWING CONCERN."

32:02.045 --> 32:03.589
TELL ME

32:02.045 --> 32:03.589
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.382
I-I DON'T FEEL GOOD

32:03.630 --> 32:05.382
ABOUT THIS.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.926
IT'S AT THIS POINT

32:05.424 --> 32:07.926
IN THE JOHN LE CARRé NOVELS

32:07.967 --> 32:09.720
WHERE THINGS

32:07.967 --> 32:09.720
GO HORRIBLY WRONG.

32:09.762 --> 32:13.849
OH, DON'T WORRY.

32:09.762 --> 32:13.849
I USED TO DO THIS WITH LORELAI.

32:13.891 --> 32:15.809
ONCE,

32:13.891 --> 32:15.809
I OPENED HER DRESSER,

32:15.851 --> 32:17.436
AND IT WAS CHOCK-FULL

32:15.851 --> 32:17.436
OF TOOTSIE ROLLS.

32:17.477 --> 32:19.938
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS,

32:17.477 --> 32:19.938
PRACTICALLY SPILLING OUT.

32:19.979 --> 32:22.941
WHAT COULD A GIRL WANT WITH

32:19.979 --> 32:22.941
A DRAWER FULL OF TOOTSIE ROLLS?

32:22.982 --> 32:25.736
PERHAPS IT WAS WHAT WAS

32:22.982 --> 32:25.736
<i>UNDER</i> THE TOOTSIE ROLLS.

32:25.778 --> 32:28.447
<i>UNDER</i> THE TOOTSIE ROLLS!

32:25.778 --> 32:28.447
OH, MY GOD!

32:28.488 --> 32:30.449
I SHOULD HAVE LOOKED

32:28.488 --> 32:30.449
UNDER THE TOOTSIE ROLLS.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.284
OH, THAT'S GONNA

32:30.490 --> 32:32.284
BOTHER ME.

32:32.325 --> 32:33.660
GOD KNOWS

32:32.325 --> 32:33.660
WHAT SHE HAD IN THERE.

32:33.702 --> 32:35.287
LET'S SPLIT UP.

32:35.328 --> 32:37.748
I'LL HIT THE BEDROOM.

32:35.328 --> 32:37.748
YOU FINISH UP IN HERE.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.165
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

32:39.207 --> 32:40.542
CHECK THE BOOKCASE.

32:40.584 --> 32:43.336
THEY LOVE HIDING THINGS

32:40.584 --> 32:43.336
BEHIND BOOKS.

32:43.378 --> 32:47.758
MY. THIS ROOM HAS REALLY

32:43.378 --> 32:47.758
COME TOGETHER.

32:47.800 --> 32:51.177
BUT WE SHOULD HAVE GONE

32:47.800 --> 32:51.177
WITH THE PLANTATION SHUTTERS.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.764
OH, MY GOD! RICHARD!

32:53.806 --> 32:55.307
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

32:55.348 --> 32:56.975
THE BIRKIN BAG.

32:57.016 --> 32:59.728
ALL HANDMADE.

32:57.016 --> 32:59.728
LOOK AT THOSE TINY STITCHES.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.313
OH, DOES THAT LOGAN

32:59.770 --> 33:01.313
HAVE TASTE.

33:01.354 --> 33:04.316
OKAY, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

33:01.354 --> 33:04.316
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

33:04.357 --> 33:05.400
OH! AND THAT SMELL!

33:05.442 --> 33:06.944
LET'S JUST GO.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.028
AT LEAST TELL ME

33:06.985 --> 33:09.028
WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING TO FIND.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.239
I DON'T KNOW.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.239
IT WASN'T MY IDEA TO BREAK IN.

33:11.281 --> 33:14.159
SNOOPING WITHOUT KNOWING

33:11.281 --> 33:14.159
WHAT YOU WERE SNOOPING FOR?

33:11.281 --> 33:14.159
HONESTLY, RICHARD.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.786
LET'S JUST GO, EMILY --

33:14.200 --> 33:15.786
NOW.

33:15.828 --> 33:17.287
AND LEAVE THAT PURSE.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.331
I WAS GOING TO

33:17.329 --> 33:19.331
LEAVE THE PURSE, RICHARD.

33:19.372 --> 33:21.625
A 21-YEAR-OLD GIRL

33:19.372 --> 33:21.625
HAS A BIRKIN BAG,

33:21.667 --> 33:23.669
AND A GROWN WOMAN DOESN'T.

33:23.710 --> 33:25.337
[ SNIFFS ] AH!

33:25.378 --> 33:27.255
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND

33:25.378 --> 33:27.255
MINIATURE GOLF,

33:27.297 --> 33:29.842
WHERE, COINCIDENTALLY,

33:27.297 --> 33:29.842
I HOLD THE SINGLE-ROUND RECORD.

33:29.883 --> 33:31.551
THE PROPERTY'S

33:29.883 --> 33:31.551
GOT CLOSED-CIRCUIT,

33:31.593 --> 33:33.219
SO YOU CAN FORGET

33:31.593 --> 33:33.219
ABOUT MULLIGANS.
