WEBVTT

00:12.680 --> 00:13.669
(DOOR OPENS)

00:15.766 --> 00:18.849
The Patuxent River
Naval Air Station near DC

00:18.936 --> 00:23.396
was commissioned in 1943
by John McCain's grandfather.

00:25.109 --> 00:26.349
I'm thinking of
going hang-gliding.

00:26.444 --> 00:28.935
Pax River's,
like, completely flat.

00:29.030 --> 00:31.942
I think that's why they tested
the V-22 Osprey there.

00:35.745 --> 00:37.531
I like naval stuff.

00:37.622 --> 00:39.362
I like their oranges and lint.

00:39.457 --> 00:42.369
What looks like
kidney disease but isn't?
And where's Chase?

00:42.460 --> 00:45.293
Root canal and Berger's.
The first one was
regarding Chase,

00:45.379 --> 00:48.496
root canal, if done
correctly, doesn't look
like kidney disease.

00:49.634 --> 00:50.794
Got a case for you.

00:50.968 --> 00:52.174
Smells funny.

00:52.303 --> 00:54.885
Patient had
an idiopathic
anaphylactic reaction,

00:54.972 --> 00:57.805
stumped two ER docs
and an immunologist
from Johns Hopkins.

00:57.934 --> 01:00.801
Patient went from asymptomatic
to fried kidneys
in less than a year,

01:00.978 --> 01:03.515
stumped three internists
and a department
chair from Harvard.

01:03.648 --> 01:05.889
Fourteen-year-old girl,
intermittent attacks.

01:05.983 --> 01:09.271
Four-year-old boy,
consistently at death's door.

01:17.495 --> 01:18.655
This patient
died five years ago.

01:21.707 --> 01:23.538
Didn't say which side
of the door he was on.

01:27.004 --> 01:29.211
The fact that he's dead
makes it more interesting.

01:29.340 --> 01:31.456
Four-year-olds do
not die of Berger's.

01:36.722 --> 01:37.837
I thought it was relevant.

01:37.974 --> 01:40.056
Death is a consequence,
not a symptom,

01:40.184 --> 01:42.345
and if it's not a symptom,
it's not relevant.

01:45.189 --> 01:48.147
Shouldn't we be
trying to maximize
what we can save here?

01:48.234 --> 01:50.225
The 14-year-old,
your freedom, our asses...

01:54.156 --> 01:56.192
Right. Save your asses.

02:31.736 --> 02:34.068
She was in a car
accident when she was two.

02:34.405 --> 02:36.487
She only had minor injuries
but her father died.

02:36.574 --> 02:38.189
That was 12 years ago.
You think that's pertinent?

02:38.284 --> 02:40.149
No, I think it's sad.

02:41.120 --> 02:45.284
She got sick
in the middle of her
14th birthday party.

02:45.416 --> 02:47.156
Which is sad and pertinent.

02:47.251 --> 02:49.788
Maybe she was
opening a present
that triggered the reaction.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.911
Where's House?
Pissing contest
with Foreman.

02:52.131 --> 02:53.667
Last thing she ate
was strawberry cake

02:53.758 --> 02:55.464
but allergy
tests for everything
were negative.

02:55.593 --> 02:58.460
You like your dentist?
I'm still going to
my pediatric one.

02:58.596 --> 03:00.757
What's your dentist's name?

03:01.599 --> 03:02.759
Williams.

03:02.892 --> 03:04.052
JESSICA: But what if it's not
an allergic reaction?

03:04.143 --> 03:05.883
Hereditary angioedema
or systemic

03:06.020 --> 03:07.760
mastocytosis could
mimic anaphylaxis.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.642
You're not sure of his name?
You just saw him this morning.

03:11.776 --> 03:13.983
The assistant's name is Angie,
her home number is...

03:14.153 --> 03:17.190
Normal complement studies,
no skin lesions.

03:17.281 --> 03:20.148
You had a manicure.
This is fresh.
You weren't at the dentist.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.743
Why would you
lie about that?

03:21.952 --> 03:23.032
To avoid having
this conversation.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.031
JESSICA: Elevated BP.
What about
pheochromocytoma?

03:25.122 --> 03:27.909
Or an anaphylactoid reaction,
which could be
triggered by certain opioids.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.491
You've had your
hair cut three times
since I've met you.

03:30.586 --> 03:32.042
You can't be
embarrassed
about a manicure.

03:32.171 --> 03:33.661
There's got to be
a deeper reason.

03:33.756 --> 03:34.962
Did House give you homework?

03:35.132 --> 03:36.338
She's not on any meds.

03:36.467 --> 03:37.707
Haven't you heard?
Everybody lies.

03:37.802 --> 03:39.042
And the tox screen was clean.

03:39.804 --> 03:41.795
Feel free to
jump in at any time.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.464
VVercheck
catecholamines for pheo

03:45.601 --> 03:47.307
and run an expanded
opioid panel.

03:49.105 --> 03:50.686
drug use when her
mother's out of the room.

03:54.402 --> 03:55.482
No. Never.

03:55.611 --> 03:56.691
Nobody's here to
bust you, lris,

03:56.779 --> 03:58.735
we just need to know if...
No. I already told you.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.067
| just take
vitamin C sometimes.

04:02.785 --> 04:05.276
What exactly were you doing
when you had your reaction?

04:05.621 --> 04:07.907
Opening a birthday present.
The Magic 8-Ball.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.950
The joke gift,
not the cocaine.
Is that it?

04:14.213 --> 04:17.330
Certain drugs could
explain her reaction.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.334
What kind of drugs?

04:22.471 --> 04:24.086
What kind did
you have in mind?

04:26.267 --> 04:28.679
lris has always
been a moody girl,

04:28.769 --> 04:31.727
and now that she's a teenager,
it's gotten worse.

04:31.856 --> 04:36.065
So for the past few months,
I've been giving
something to relax her.

04:36.152 --> 04:39.019
Diazepam.
| tell her
it's vitamin C.

04:39.363 --> 04:42.730
Being normal is
very important to lris.

04:42.825 --> 04:45.237
She couldn't handle
the thought of being on meds.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.784
Anti-anxiety
medications would
explain it.

04:48.289 --> 04:52.202
If we keep her off,
she'll be moody
but healthy.

04:54.545 --> 04:55.580
(IRIS COUGHING AND CHOKING)

04:55.671 --> 04:58.162
Or it's something else.

05:03.387 --> 05:04.923
HOUSE: Need to DDx
a patient with you.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.636
I thought you had
a team for that.

05:06.724 --> 05:08.931
According to Foreman,
they're only

05:09.059 --> 05:11.311
for DDxing people
who are still alive.

05:12.688 --> 05:14.019
You have a dead patient?

05:14.940 --> 05:17.192
Bigotry is born
when we add modifiers.

05:17.443 --> 05:19.684
I don't see creed,
color, pulse.

05:19.778 --> 05:22.565
Foreman will find out
you're taking this case
and he'll bust you.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.318
But you know that,
which means...

05:26.535 --> 05:30.323
You want to go back to jail

05:30.414 --> 05:32.154
because it's the one place

05:32.249 --> 05:35.912
you're unable to indulge
your self-destructive habits.

05:36.045 --> 05:38.661
Yeah. It's much more likely
that I'm taking this case

05:38.923 --> 05:41.585
because I miss
showering with
Cro-Magnons,

05:41.717 --> 05:44.333
than I actually happen
to find it interesting.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.214
Four-year-old kid.

05:46.722 --> 05:51.386
His kidneys died,
they transfused,
his lungs died, he died.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.722
Have you seen
Bride of the Monster?

05:53.854 --> 05:55.355
I just got
the Ed Wood box set.

05:55.439 --> 05:56.940
What if the chicken
was the egg?

05:57.066 --> 05:58.522
What if the lung
involvement came first?

05:58.609 --> 06:00.145
I don't really
care about the movie,

06:00.277 --> 06:01.858
I just don't want
to indulge your...

06:02.029 --> 06:03.565
Lupus.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.278
Because this is
a bad idea, House.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.613
If the kid had a rash
or some circulation issue...

06:10.246 --> 06:11.952
Damn!

06:13.457 --> 06:16.790
Sorry. Just realized I'm late
for my anger management class.

06:20.631 --> 06:22.462
GENE: Traffic, for sure.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.373

06:30.641 --> 06:31.801
Any others?

06:31.892 --> 06:33.632
And I lose my temper
when someone suggests

06:33.769 --> 06:35.885
that a handful of
pop-psych catchphrases

06:35.980 --> 06:39.222
can control our most seminal,
intractable

06:39.358 --> 06:42.646
and natural
reaction to a dead child.

06:45.447 --> 06:47.153
Am I right, Emory?

06:52.204 --> 06:54.616
I don't think Emory
wants to share right now.

06:54.707 --> 06:57.540
They blew it, didn't they?
They missed your son's rash.

06:57.835 --> 06:59.291
A faint one, on his cheek.

06:59.420 --> 07:00.830
He didn't have a rash.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.621
I think we should talk about
Lena's grandchildren.

07:03.716 --> 07:04.831
They're alive.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.665
Was he sensitive to sunlight?
No.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.383

Cold fingers and toes?

07:08.512 --> 07:09.627
No!

07:19.023 --> 07:22.231

I need to examine your son.

07:23.027 --> 07:25.359
You're a bit late
for that, you ass.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.519
With you and
your wife's consent,

07:27.698 --> 07:29.359
we could get
an exhumation order.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.990
Find out what killed him.

07:32.077 --> 07:35.444
Ex-wife and you'll
never get her consent.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.530
She's moved on,
new hub, new kid.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.622
She wants nothing to
do with Drew's death.

07:39.710 --> 07:40.916
Or me.

07:43.881 --> 07:46.543
You're angry
because your kid died.

07:46.759 --> 07:50.047
More than that,
because you
don't have an answer.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.045
People need answers.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.982
He's in a crypt at
St. Jude's Cemetery.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.272
JESSICA: You feeling
any pain or cramp in here?

08:11.367 --> 08:12.447
A bit.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.074
But notjust there. Um...

08:15.663 --> 08:17.073
Here.

08:17.247 --> 08:20.990
Breast tenderness.
Have you been having
regular periods, Iris?

08:21.085 --> 08:22.746
Not really.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.289
What is it?

08:25.422 --> 08:26.502
I think we should
run a pregnancy test.

08:27.174 --> 08:31.417
Iris isn't sexually active.
She doesn't even
have a boyfriend.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.343
Pregnancy would explain
all of her symptoms,

08:33.472 --> 08:35.804
can even cause
some unpredictable
allergic reactions.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.265
How can I be pregnant
if I've never even had sex?

08:39.436 --> 08:41.142
We just need to
draw a bit of blood.

08:44.608 --> 08:46.064
What's the matter?

08:46.193 --> 08:47.694
My arms.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.940
I can't feel my arms.

08:59.373 --> 09:03.912
At this rate,
I'm gonna need to pick
out a plot for myself.

MILTON: Thanks to your
generous donation,
you have all morning.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.836
More like 13 minutes.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.758
Before we proceed
any further, Doctor,
I'd like to inquire

09:13.846 --> 09:17.805
as to exactly what procedure
you intend to perform
on the remains.

09:18.642 --> 09:22.510
You ever heard of
the North American Man
Dead Boy Love Association?

09:24.565 --> 09:27.523
I consider these
grounds to be a holy place

09:27.651 --> 09:30.313
and I would ask
you to observe them
with due decorum.

09:31.321 --> 09:34.984
So you're taking
bribes to plunder graves
and I need to show respect.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.031
I think they got
the cause of death wrong

09:40.330 --> 09:44.118
andiflﬁnd
a hole in the cartilage
of his nose, right about here,

09:44.209 --> 09:46.325
then it means I'm right.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.830
Please be respectful.

09:56.513 --> 09:59.380
I have prepared
the sarcophagus for you.

10:00.893 --> 10:02.599
Thank you, Igor.

11:00.744 --> 11:06.239
So she lost
the use of her arms

that Chase isn't there.

11:24.935 --> 11:27.597
No, I'm here.
Where are you?

11:27.729 --> 11:30.766

with the diagnosis.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.438
Absolutely.

11:36.572 --> 11:38.858
Even though there
are three diagnoses.

11:38.949 --> 11:42.817
And MS and vascu/itis
usually get
better with pregnancy.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.827
Yeah. I was saying I agreed
with the other one.

11:53.630 --> 11:58.465
I assume from the silence
that Chase has
had a Brazilian.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.758
Cool.
Interesting.

12:00.846 --> 12:01.926
Ouch.

12:09.354 --> 12:12.312
The question is,
is this really about a woman,

12:12.608 --> 12:14.064
or is it about
something more profound?

12:14.151 --> 12:17.109
Another question is,
could the paraesthesia
be caused by an STD?

that either you
all agree with Chase

12:27.497 --> 12:30.239
or you're just staring
at his emasculated brow.

12:30.334 --> 12:35.829
In either case, test for HIV
and do an MRI to
rule out tumors.

12:37.716 --> 12:40.378
And check Chase
for testosterone.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.349
(MACHINE WHIRRING)

12:59.196 --> 13:03.030

13:06.870 --> 13:08.861
It was fine. Hurt a bit.

What about House's theory?
Why'd you really do it?

13:11.375 --> 13:13.366
Because I'm vain

There's nothing profound here.

No tumor either.

What's the matter?

No. Now they're sore.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.179
The paraesthesia's gone.

13:45.409 --> 13:47.400
Could the bruising
be caused
by physical trauma?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.985
You think she fell
out of bed repeatedly?

13:50.080 --> 13:52.571
A blood disorder,
maybe thrombocytopenia?

13:52.708 --> 13:53.948
A vitamin K
deficiency or scurvy

13:54.084 --> 13:55.324
could explain
bleeding problems

13:55.419 --> 13:57.330
and pregnancy
could exacerbate it.

13:57.421 --> 14:01.334
Boys, do a home search,
girls, do the lab tests.

14:01.425 --> 14:03.837
I'm pretty sure
that's not sexist.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.918
Where've you been?

14:06.054 --> 14:09.842
Picking up dry cleaning,
filling up the tank,
violating the dead.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.341
If you don't believe me,
call the monitoring company.

14:12.436 --> 14:13.551
Idid.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.601
Unfortunately,
the Patuxent River

14:15.731 --> 14:17.517
Naval Air
Station was GPS testing

14:17.607 --> 14:19.268
and disrupted the signal

14:19.359 --> 14:21.896
at the exact same 45 minutes
you weren't here.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.777
If I'd known I had
45 minutes of freedom,

14:24.906 --> 14:26.612
I would have
gone hang-gliding.

14:26.742 --> 14:27.948
I admire the creativity.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.367
But what happens
when the stunt doesn't work?

14:30.620 --> 14:32.531
You think you're gonna
have to pay off a bet?

14:32.664 --> 14:34.620
You think I'm gonna
triple your clinic hours?

14:34.708 --> 14:38.075
I'm gonna call your PO
and you're gonna
go back to jail.

14:47.304 --> 14:48.840
HOUSE: There are Mees lines
on his fingernails,

14:48.972 --> 14:50.553
so now I'm thinking
heavy metal poisoning.

14:50.766 --> 14:52.631
You're an addict.
And I'm an idiot

14:52.726 --> 14:55.092
for thinking that your
addictions were limited

14:55.228 --> 14:57.560
to pills, anti-social
behavior and sarcasm.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.808
(BURPS) Sorry.
Vicodin repeating on me.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.645
You're also
addicted to puzzles.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.730
You show all
the classic behaviors,

15:04.821 --> 15:06.937
lying,
neglecting responsibilities,

15:07.032 --> 15:09.648
and you can't stop no matter
how devastating
the consequences.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.859
Working on
a medical case is not

15:11.995 --> 15:14.156
a parole violation,
it's my job description.

15:14.331 --> 15:17.664
Yourjob description is doing
what Foreman tells you to do.

15:17.751 --> 15:22.290
Never mind Bride
of the Monster,
you need to watch Norma Rae.

15:23.048 --> 15:25.164
HOUSE: Before we get started,
I just want to

15:25.342 --> 15:27.458
thank you all for
agreeing to relocate.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.088
I had an appointment
in this part of town

15:29.179 --> 15:30.589
and I obviously
didn't want to
miss this meeting.

15:30.847 --> 15:34.055
But thank you. I'm buying.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.222
Not literally.

15:35.727 --> 15:38.594
Hey, Emory,
shall we powder our noses?

15:44.945 --> 15:49.029
Hey, did you know your ex-wife
still lives right
behind this place?

15:52.661 --> 15:56.153
She finishes work at 4:00,
picks up her new kid at 4:15.

15:56.248 --> 15:58.364
Gives us about 20 minutes.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.370
I made some calls.

16:01.461 --> 16:05.625
It's amazing what
people will tell you
if you ask rudely enough.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.456
Was that table here?

16:12.055 --> 16:15.889
Some kinds of
pressure-treated wood
can contain arsenic.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.387
We shouldn't be here.

16:18.562 --> 16:20.348
We don't have a choice.

16:21.022 --> 16:23.479
This is the only way
I'm gonna get your answer.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.938
Does your ex leave
a spare key anywhere?

16:27.863 --> 16:28.943
How did he look?

16:37.330 --> 16:39.366
Peaceful.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.743
Vitamin K deficiency's a bust.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.792
Fridge has more
spinach and broccoli
than a farmers' market.

16:47.883 --> 16:51.125
The Brazilian,
you said it hurt a bit.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.087
You've had one?
More than one.
And you haven't.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.218
They hurt all your bits.

16:57.642 --> 17:00.725
That's my dark secret.
What's yours?

17:02.147 --> 17:04.980
I had the nails
and eyebrows done
but that's it.

17:05.066 --> 17:07.227
I just needed to
create a distraction.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.685
I met a TV
producer at a dinner,

17:09.779 --> 17:12.521
she asked me to appear
on their medical segment.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.356
I screen tested it
yesterday and shot it today.

17:15.452 --> 17:18.068
You're a TV doctor?

17:18.163 --> 17:20.199
It's a one-off.
When did it air?

17:21.291 --> 17:24.124
Two hours ago,
otherwise I'd
still be lying.

17:25.503 --> 17:29.371
This is what she was opening
when she had her attack.

17:29.466 --> 17:32.549
Will anyone believe Chase
is an actual doctor?

17:34.262 --> 17:36.093
"Don't count on it."

17:48.068 --> 17:49.524
She does have a boyfriend.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.237
Love letters.

17:53.782 --> 17:55.568
Porn?
CHASE: The nasty kind.

17:55.659 --> 17:59.151

One box in
the bottom of a closet.

20:17.801 --> 20:20.543
He used to wear
those stupid things
all the time.

20:20.845 --> 20:24.212
I used to have to
pretend I was scared.

Republic of Lead Paint.

the end of our class.

(DOOR CLOSES)

20:43.493 --> 20:45.404
I met him at school.

20:46.204 --> 20:47.819
He was the only
boy that liked me.

20:48.498 --> 20:50.454
It's a little more than like.

20:51.209 --> 20:52.540
We haven't had sex.

20:52.794 --> 20:55.206
Oh, come on,
Iris, you're pregnant.

20:55.338 --> 20:56.748
So I'm just lying
about everything?

20:56.840 --> 20:58.626
Well,
you lied about
the boyfriend,

20:58.716 --> 21:03.836
you obviously
lied about sex
and this garbage.

21:03.972 --> 21:06.338
They're his. He can't
keep them at his place.

21:06.641 --> 21:09.929
Well, I'm glad we could
be so accommodating.

21:10.019 --> 21:12.351
What else don't I know?

21:20.196 --> 21:21.572
Honey.

21:22.991 --> 21:24.527
What is it?

21:27.704 --> 21:32.368
He came here last night,
and he told me I should leave.

21:32.876 --> 21:35.709
But I didn't want
to and he got mad.

21:38.715 --> 21:40.455
He hit you?
Physical trauma.

21:40.550 --> 21:42.086
TAUB: Explains the negatives
for the blood disorders.

21:42.218 --> 21:44.300
We should call the police.

21:44.387 --> 21:45.888
I won't tell them anything.

21:46.890 --> 21:49.552
That's ridiculous,
he beat you.

21:55.190 --> 21:56.225
What is it?

21:56.316 --> 21:57.772
It's getting hard to see.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.898
What the hell is
happening to me?

22:08.244 --> 22:10.405
Rubbing alcohol, vinegar...

22:11.581 --> 22:13.071
Not sure what this is.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.911
Aren't there
actual medical tests?

22:16.294 --> 22:18.785
Dead patients usually get
a lower standard of care.

22:19.422 --> 22:25.258
Pink means lead,
orange means mercury
and rust means arsenic.

22:25.929 --> 22:27.260
EMORY: What's brown mean?

22:27.931 --> 22:29.137
Scotch.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.801
He used to call him Deezer.

23:10.807 --> 23:13.344
He couldn't say "zebra."

23:13.476 --> 23:17.469
Made up his own
words for everything.
We called them Drewisms.

23:21.943 --> 23:23.979
How does your ex-wife do it?

23:25.321 --> 23:29.314
How come she's not
angry and miserable?

23:33.288 --> 23:36.121
She treated it like
it never happened.

23:36.499 --> 23:38.000
She never even cried.

23:39.335 --> 23:41.371
Not even at his funeral.

23:42.714 --> 23:46.002
I was a mess and she
just sat there like

23:48.386 --> 23:50.001
a statue.

23:57.020 --> 23:58.135

(ELEVATOR DINGS)

24:04.569 --> 24:07.060
Why do you care if
he works on two cases?

24:07.196 --> 24:09.687
Because next it'll be
three cases, then four,

24:09.824 --> 24:13.612
then animal cases
and ghost cases,
then animal-ghost cases.

24:13.703 --> 24:15.944
Assuming, of course,
we are talking about House.

24:16.039 --> 24:18.325
You're just setting
yourself up to fail.

He has a lot more
to lose than I do.
And he knows that.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.586
He's rational.

24:22.837 --> 24:23.872
No, he's not.

24:24.005 --> 24:26.838
He's the most
rational man I've ever met.
Annoyingly so.

24:26.924 --> 24:29.791
He's not gonna put
himself back in jail
over a dead kid.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.001
He's an addict.

24:31.095 --> 24:34.679
And he will put
himself back in jail
over a puzzle.

24:35.391 --> 24:37.006
He'll back down.

cost her some big bikkies.

25:28.403 --> 25:30.485
So you just wanted
to look pretty on TV?

25:30.613 --> 25:32.604
Question is,
why did he want that?

25:33.074 --> 25:34.063
Clinic time.

Hi. I'm here for
the free flu shot.
I got a call saying...

25:51.467 --> 25:53.799
And I'm here to find out
why you didn't care
about your first kid.

25:54.178 --> 25:56.794
Losing a child,
you just breezed
right through it.

25:58.182 --> 25:59.297
What do you know
about my first kid?

25:59.434 --> 26:01.390
Couldn't even
squeeze out a single tear
at the funeral.

26:01.477 --> 26:03.217
Where are you getting this?
Couldn't wait to squeeze out

26:03.312 --> 26:05.268
a brand new replacement kid.

26:08.025 --> 26:09.356
Damn it.

26:10.486 --> 26:11.646
You had no right to say that.

26:11.821 --> 26:12.981
I know. I deserved the slap.

26:13.156 --> 26:15.738
But I was hoping
that you
weren't capable of it.

26:15.825 --> 26:17.656
Apathetic hyperthyroidism.

26:17.994 --> 26:21.987
Could have kidney involvement,
could be genetic,
definitely causes apathy.

26:22.290 --> 26:24.451
I was hoping that
your lack of emotion

26:24.542 --> 26:28.956
was a symptom of something
you could've passed
on to your first son.

26:31.340 --> 26:32.466
You know Emory.

26:33.217 --> 26:34.593
We belong to the same club.

26:34.677 --> 26:37.293
He wants to
relive this, I don't.

26:37.472 --> 26:39.133
So I heard.

26:45.688 --> 26:47.849
Emory was a wonderful man.

26:48.816 --> 26:51.057
Never afraid to
show his emotions.

26:51.194 --> 26:54.903
Which is great
most of the time
but when Drew died,

26:54.989 --> 26:56.354
it overwhelmed him.

26:58.034 --> 26:59.865
I vowed I wouldn't
let that happen to me.

27:01.037 --> 27:02.368
That's why you left him?

27:02.497 --> 27:03.828
I left because of his eyes.

27:06.042 --> 27:08.704
He had Drew's eyes.

27:12.006 --> 27:13.507
Who used to babysit Drew?

27:14.383 --> 27:16.374
My father, but...
His place or yours?

27:19.055 --> 27:20.966
There are two types of people.

27:21.057 --> 27:22.968
Those who can move on
and those who can't.

27:23.059 --> 27:26.517
My father keeps
up a good front
but he's just like Emory.

27:26.604 --> 27:28.811
You need to leave him alone.

27:28.898 --> 27:31.560
So he has two types of
people inside of him.

27:43.579 --> 27:44.659
Yeah...

27:44.747 --> 27:46.362
I found out where
your boyfriend lives.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.369
When I paid him a visit,
he took off,

27:49.585 --> 27:51.200
ran in front of a car.

27:51.295 --> 27:52.455
You're lying.

27:52.588 --> 27:54.044
He's down in the ER right now.

27:54.131 --> 27:55.337
Shut up,
you lying sack of crap!

27:55.466 --> 27:56.706
Iris.

27:57.927 --> 27:59.633
How do you know I'm lying?

27:59.762 --> 28:01.593
How do you know
that your boyfriend is okay?

28:01.722 --> 28:04.259
'Cause I'm right here,

28:11.941 --> 28:14.523
Iris has dissociative
identity disorder

28:14.652 --> 28:17.268
also known as multiple
personality disorder.

28:19.115 --> 28:20.571
Are you saying I'm crazy?

28:20.658 --> 28:22.444
It's the mind's
response to a severe trauma.

28:22.577 --> 28:23.817
The person
experiences something

28:23.953 --> 28:25.284
that's too
difficult to accept,

28:25.413 --> 28:28.405
so they create
alternate personalities
that don't have to accept it.

28:28.499 --> 28:30.364
Some think it's
quite a natural reaction.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.996
Iris hasn't had
any severe traumas.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.421
The car accident.

28:34.589 --> 28:35.999
I was two.

28:36.132 --> 28:38.043
I don't remember anything.

28:38.134 --> 28:42.594
These personalities
that I'm supposed
to have, where are they?

28:42.680 --> 28:44.841
They only come out
when you're afraid
or anxious.

28:44.974 --> 28:47.010
That's why House used
the hurt-boyfriend story.

28:47.143 --> 28:50.135
But if there's no boyfriend,
where did the bruises
come from?

28:50.438 --> 28:51.678
The pregnancy?

28:52.690 --> 28:55.147
When you say your
boyfriend hit you,

28:55.318 --> 28:57.730
it means you
actually hit yourself.

28:57.820 --> 29:03.611
TAUB: And the pregnancy

making this up?

Your symptoms are real,

30:07.974 --> 30:10.431

and others are psychological.

wrong with her

in addition to
the multiple

30:15.523 --> 30:18.640
Yes, but we won't know what
until we access her alters

30:18.734 --> 30:20.440

If you keep being stubborn,
he will keep being stubborn.
