WEBVTT

00:03.519 --> 00:05.179
I hate happy hour.

00:06.522 --> 00:08.314
Make a hole, people!

00:09.442 --> 00:12.111
So at least two of your
Marine buddies have disappeared

00:12.195 --> 00:14.068
and you think you could be next?

00:14.155 --> 00:15.318
Why?

00:15.448 --> 00:17.129
Do you have to write down
everything I say?

00:17.200 --> 00:18.860
I'm a reporter. It's what I do.

00:18.951 --> 00:21.703
I thought this was
supposed to be a date.

00:24.749 --> 00:25.864
Look,

00:26.542 --> 00:31.085
if it turns out to be true, and if I'm
next, you could end up dead, too.

00:31.672 --> 00:35.338
And if my husband finds out about us,
I'll be dead anyway.

00:37.178 --> 00:38.423
I didn't order a drink.

00:38.513 --> 00:39.971
- Your name Atlas?
- Yeah.

00:40.056 --> 00:41.965
Then I guess you've got
a secret admirer.

00:42.058 --> 00:43.220
Enjoy.

00:45.436 --> 00:48.307
- We should have gone to a hotel.
- It's probably somebody you know.

00:48.398 --> 00:50.390
That's what I'm afraid of.

00:53.069 --> 00:54.183
I'll call you.

01:04.205 --> 01:05.996
I should have told...

02:20.106 --> 02:21.683
I thought you couldn't type.

02:21.774 --> 02:23.517
I've decided to improve myself.

02:23.609 --> 02:25.767
Well, in that case,
you might want to lose that shirt.

02:25.861 --> 02:27.297
It went out of style three years ago.

02:27.321 --> 02:29.943
This from a girl who keeps
a puka shell necklace in her purse.

02:30.032 --> 02:31.941
My grandma gave me those.

02:32.034 --> 02:35.403
- Wait, you looked in my purse?
- Sorry, did I say that out loud?

02:37.456 --> 02:40.790
Tony, you are so lucky
you didn't have sisters growing up.

02:40.876 --> 02:42.039
Why is that?

02:42.128 --> 02:44.879
Because you'd never
have reached puberty.

02:47.049 --> 02:49.801
Of course, one could argue
you still haven't reached it.

02:50.970 --> 02:52.429
Very professional.

02:52.513 --> 02:54.506
- It's my lunch break.
- It's 9:30 in the morning.

02:54.598 --> 02:55.761
I'm on Greenwich Mean Time.

02:55.850 --> 02:57.160
Well, you're going to be
on unemployment

02:57.184 --> 02:58.286
if Gibbs catches you doing that.

02:58.310 --> 03:00.184
Catch him doing what, Kate?

03:00.271 --> 03:01.469
Nothing.

03:01.564 --> 03:05.063
I was just giving Tony here
some fashion advice.

03:05.151 --> 03:06.396
On what?

03:06.485 --> 03:10.150
He was just thinking about
getting both of his ears pierced.

03:10.239 --> 03:13.573
- That right, DiNozzo?
- I think Kate misunderstood, boss.

03:13.659 --> 03:15.929
What I was really talking about
was elongating the lobe...

03:15.953 --> 03:19.618
Hey, if you want to look
like a gay pirate, that's your call.

03:19.707 --> 03:22.114
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

03:22.209 --> 03:24.604
I thought you were going to an
anti-terrorism conference today, Gibbs.

03:24.628 --> 03:26.087
Change in plan.

03:26.172 --> 03:29.126
A Marine Gunnery Sergeant
didn't show up for duty this week.

03:29.216 --> 03:30.960
Since when do we track down
UA Marines?

03:31.051 --> 03:33.459
Since he's one of a handful of people

03:33.554 --> 03:36.508
who knows how to arm
small-yield nuclear weapons.

03:39.810 --> 03:42.266
His SRB.
You have 45 minutes to memorise it.

03:42.354 --> 03:43.434
And Tony,

03:43.522 --> 03:46.013
if that game's still
on your computer in the morning,

03:46.108 --> 03:47.982
I'll pierce your ears myself.

03:52.573 --> 03:54.862
How long was
the pickup truck in your lot?

03:54.950 --> 03:56.908
Since Friday night.

03:56.994 --> 03:59.663
Five days?
Why wait so long to report it?

03:59.747 --> 04:02.534
Figured somebody got lucky,
went home in a different car.

04:02.625 --> 04:05.412
- Happens around here a lot.
- I'll bet it does.

04:06.337 --> 04:08.910
The guy we're looking for is a Marine.

04:09.340 --> 04:11.795
Yeah. We get a lot of those
around here.

04:11.884 --> 04:12.963
Me?

04:13.302 --> 04:15.211
I like a man with hair.

04:15.429 --> 04:18.632
What about him?
Name's Gunnery Sergeant Bill Atlas.

04:18.724 --> 04:21.345
Yeah, sure. He was here Friday night.

04:22.269 --> 04:25.056
- Is he all right?
- That's what we're trying to find out.

04:25.147 --> 04:28.397
- Was he here with anyone?
- Yeah. Redhead.

04:28.609 --> 04:31.444
Good-looking.
I think they're having an affair.

04:31.529 --> 04:32.727
What makes you say that?

04:32.822 --> 04:36.273
Because he went out the back
and she went out the front.

04:36.742 --> 04:38.678
Kate, you stay here.
Get a description of the woman,

04:38.702 --> 04:42.071
check out his pickup truck.
DiNozzo, you're with me.

04:42.957 --> 04:45.578
If you remember anything else,
don't hesitate to call.

04:45.668 --> 04:47.625
What if I don't remember anything else?

04:50.673 --> 04:52.546
Don't hesitate to call.

04:52.758 --> 04:54.501
You got it, cowboy.

04:57.054 --> 04:59.130
He is cute.

04:59.682 --> 05:01.306
What's his deal?

05:01.392 --> 05:02.637
Tony?

05:03.769 --> 05:05.144
He's a nice guy.

05:05.229 --> 05:09.392
- You two aren't, you know...
- Oh, no. No.

05:09.483 --> 05:12.899
- No way. We're just co-workers.
- Cool.

05:12.987 --> 05:15.822
I'm a sucker for a man
in a checkered shirt.

05:17.449 --> 05:19.987
Any chance Atlas decided
to walk away from it all?

05:20.077 --> 05:21.986
The man could retire in a year.

05:22.079 --> 05:24.570
Nobody walks away
from a 20 year pension.

05:24.665 --> 05:26.741
Then it doesn't look good for him.

05:26.834 --> 05:29.455
Statistically, most bodies
turn up dead after four days.

05:29.545 --> 05:32.332
Four days? Really, DiNozzo.
Thanks for sharing.

05:32.423 --> 05:34.166
Well, I know you know. I'm just saying...

05:34.258 --> 05:37.093
- I'm not big on statistics.
- Kind of figured.

05:37.177 --> 05:38.921
I mean, since most marriages
end in divorce

05:39.013 --> 05:41.385
and you've been married three...

05:42.308 --> 05:45.095
Maybe it's like the waitress said.
He got lucky.

05:45.185 --> 05:46.561
Spread out.

05:46.729 --> 05:50.062
I want to know why Atlas
never got back to his truck.

05:55.988 --> 05:57.103
DiNozzo.

05:58.407 --> 05:59.438
Hey!

05:59.533 --> 06:02.368
- Get your butt over here.
- Is he always like that?

06:02.995 --> 06:04.786
Only when he's awake.

06:12.463 --> 06:14.751
Atlas was forced to leave here.

06:14.965 --> 06:17.373
No Marine would leave
a Zippo like this behind.

06:21.472 --> 06:24.426
- I've got an unsmoked cigarette here.
- Bag it.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.641
What're you thinking, boss?

06:34.151 --> 06:37.271
Wherever Atlas is,
his luck is running out.

06:42.618 --> 06:44.610
You don't have to do this.

06:45.162 --> 06:48.033
Just tell me. Just tell me what you want.

06:50.501 --> 06:52.292
What about some food?

06:52.586 --> 06:54.828
Can I at least have some food?

06:55.005 --> 06:56.630
Say something!

06:57.299 --> 06:59.091
Who the hell are you?

07:07.935 --> 07:11.019
I've got a rough sketch of the woman
Atlas was having an affair with.

07:11.105 --> 07:14.106
It's not much to go on, but if he was
having an affair with a married woman

07:14.191 --> 07:16.044
then we have a motive for someone
wanting him to vanish.

07:16.068 --> 07:17.147
Pull his phone records.

07:17.236 --> 07:18.755
See if we can't match
that face with a phone number.

07:18.779 --> 07:21.151
I already made a request
for the subpoena.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.699
DiNozzo.

07:22.783 --> 07:24.823
He's about a step
from vanishing himself.

07:24.952 --> 07:26.031
Hey!

07:26.704 --> 07:28.661
- Ciao, bella.
- See you.

07:29.206 --> 07:33.619
- I got her name, boss.
- Do I look like I care, DiNozzo? Let's go.

07:33.877 --> 07:36.914
The woman with Atlas,
her name's Carol Powers.

07:38.215 --> 07:41.964
I got the waitress to remember
she paid using a credit card.

07:44.138 --> 07:45.548
She's a reporter for The Post.

07:45.639 --> 07:49.471
I can have her in our office
in an hour if you're interested.

07:52.604 --> 07:53.885
Good job.

07:54.189 --> 07:56.894
I'm sorry, boss. Did you say something?

07:56.984 --> 08:00.435
- Did he just say something, Kate?
- Don't push it, Tony.

08:01.113 --> 08:03.782
Pushing it's what I love about this job.

08:03.866 --> 08:06.107
That, and the beautiful girls.

08:14.752 --> 08:17.836
I appreciate you coming down here
on such short notice, Mrs Powers.

08:17.921 --> 08:19.629
Please, have a seat.

08:19.715 --> 08:24.044
Look, can the polite act, Agent Todd.
What exactly do you want from me?

08:24.386 --> 08:26.343
- Information.
- About what?

08:26.722 --> 08:29.509
Your relationship
with Gunnery Sergeant Atlas.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.845
Who?

08:32.811 --> 08:34.304
Look familiar?

08:34.520 --> 08:36.347
Yeah. Maybe. I...

08:36.440 --> 08:38.812
I'm a reporter,
and I've interviewed dozens of Marines.

08:38.900 --> 08:42.186
The thing is, this Marine
disappeared five days ago.

08:42.529 --> 08:43.857
My job is to get him back.

08:44.740 --> 08:47.029
What's that got to do with me?

08:47.826 --> 08:50.531
Did your husband know
you're having an affair?

08:50.621 --> 08:52.827
- Excuse me?
- I'll take that as a no.

08:52.915 --> 08:54.243
I think we're done here.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.372
Here's the phone number
you requested, Agent Todd.

08:56.460 --> 09:00.873
Should I try your husband at home
or work this time of day, Mrs Powers?

09:06.261 --> 09:08.301
Look, I don't know what
happened to Atlas, okay?

09:08.388 --> 09:10.547
But my husband had
nothing to do with this.

09:10.641 --> 09:12.301
So he knew you were having an affair?

09:12.392 --> 09:14.184
No. Derek was on assignment

09:14.269 --> 09:16.096
in Italy, and he just got back last night.

09:16.188 --> 09:17.999
If you check with The Post,
they'll vouch for him.

09:18.023 --> 09:19.221
Oh, I will.

09:20.442 --> 09:21.984
How did you meet Atlas?

09:22.069 --> 09:24.311
At a bar, three weeks ago.

09:24.446 --> 09:26.902
He said he had a story
that I might be interested in.

09:26.990 --> 09:28.751
You sleep with anyone
who offers you a story,

09:28.826 --> 09:31.198
or is that one of the fringe benefits?

09:31.286 --> 09:34.572
- This is a nightmare.
- What story did Atlas tell you?

09:36.583 --> 09:38.576
He thought someone
might have killed his friends

09:38.669 --> 09:40.661
and that he could be next.

09:41.046 --> 09:43.751
- Did he say why?
- No, he wouldn't tell me.

09:44.341 --> 09:46.461
I thought it might be
connected with his work in Iraq.

09:46.510 --> 09:48.384
Some kind of cover-up.

09:49.972 --> 09:53.257
It says here you write articles
on home improvement.

09:53.350 --> 09:54.844
Gardens, mostly.

09:55.519 --> 09:58.206
I just... I thought if I could get
a story like this, then I could...

09:58.230 --> 09:59.938
Yeah. I understand.

10:00.023 --> 10:01.850
Most reporters, they'd

10:02.025 --> 10:05.975
absolutely kill for a scoop like this.

10:11.785 --> 10:13.612
He tried to warn me.

10:13.704 --> 10:16.182
He told me that if he talked,
something like this might happen.

10:16.206 --> 10:19.824
- Something like what?
- Someone in his unit would kill him.

10:25.457 --> 10:26.868
I think she's telling the truth.

10:26.958 --> 10:29.829
The question is,
was Gunnery Sergeant Atlas?

10:30.087 --> 10:32.494
Some guys will say anything
to get a woman into bed.

10:32.589 --> 10:36.207
She's a reporter.
I doubt she'd fall for something like that.

10:36.301 --> 10:38.210
You're kidding, right?

10:38.387 --> 10:39.549
What do you mean?

10:39.638 --> 10:43.173
All men lie to some degree, Kate.
It's expected of them.

10:43.266 --> 10:46.137
All right, well, don't confuse
your world with reality, Tony.

10:46.228 --> 10:49.229
It's like when a woman
asks a man to guess her age.

10:49.314 --> 10:51.022
You ever done that?

10:51.108 --> 10:53.812
You honestly still believe you look 25?

10:56.279 --> 10:57.655
Not anymore.

10:59.199 --> 11:00.880
I've never done anything like this before.

11:00.951 --> 11:03.702
- I only wanted a story.
- You've got one.

11:03.787 --> 11:07.286
Is there any way, anything that I can do
to keep my husband out of this?

11:07.374 --> 11:08.619
Truth?

11:09.084 --> 11:10.198
Nope.

11:11.002 --> 11:13.410
You know,
I could publish what Atlas told me.

11:13.505 --> 11:15.877
It wouldn't look so good
for the Marine Corps.

11:15.966 --> 11:17.793
I don't read The Post.

11:20.887 --> 11:22.512
Watch your step.

11:23.515 --> 11:25.555
Regardless of what
you may think of me, Agent Gibbs,

11:25.642 --> 11:28.263
I truly hope that you find Bill
and that he's still alive.

11:28.353 --> 11:29.634
Me, too.

11:31.106 --> 11:34.439
- You were pretty tough on her in there.
- Yeah. She reminds me of my ex-wife.

11:34.526 --> 11:36.400
- Which one?
- All of them.

11:36.486 --> 11:39.487
- Did her husband's story check out?
- He was in Italy,

11:39.573 --> 11:42.609
arrived at Reagan National
last night at 2116.

11:42.701 --> 11:43.899
Looks like a dead end.

11:43.994 --> 11:46.139
Do you believe that story
about a cover-up in Iraq, Gibbs?

11:46.163 --> 11:47.194
I don't know.

11:47.289 --> 11:48.850
I'm more concerned about
what's happening here.

11:48.874 --> 11:49.905
Meaning?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.751
Meaning Atlas was a 2336.

11:52.836 --> 11:54.710
Explosive Ordnance
Disposal Technician.

11:54.796 --> 11:57.750
Guys can make or disarm
anything from a grenade to a

11:57.841 --> 11:59.169
backpack nuke.

11:59.259 --> 12:02.509
If someone's kidnapping
EOD Personnel, I want to know why.

12:02.596 --> 12:04.006
Terrorists?

12:09.311 --> 12:13.095
- Anyone missing from Atlas' unit?
- They're all accounted for.

12:13.940 --> 12:15.600
But I might have something else here.

12:15.692 --> 12:17.685
A new CO checked into
his command last month,

12:17.777 --> 12:19.106
Major Joe Sacco.

12:19.196 --> 12:21.319
His record's clean,
except for a non-punitive letter

12:21.406 --> 12:23.446
of punishment from when he was
a First Lieutenant.

12:23.533 --> 12:24.760
- For what?
- He got into a fight

12:24.784 --> 12:26.777
with a couple of enlisted men in '92.

12:26.870 --> 12:28.697
Atlas was one of them.

12:30.582 --> 12:31.957
Yeah. Gibbs.

12:32.584 --> 12:35.336
We're on our way.
Abby's found something.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.624
Do you think Atlas is still alive?

12:38.715 --> 12:40.791
No ransom note.
Been missing over five days.

12:40.884 --> 12:43.090
I'd say the odds were against him.

12:54.022 --> 12:56.774
Why are you doing this,
you sick bastard?

12:57.400 --> 12:59.808
Do you think you can make me talk?

13:01.488 --> 13:05.071
Who are you?
What is the name of your organisation?

13:21.049 --> 13:22.164
Hi, guys.

13:22.259 --> 13:23.421
- Hey, Abby.
- Hi.

13:23.510 --> 13:25.613
I think I found out how they bagged
your missing Marine.

13:25.637 --> 13:27.179
From one cigarette butt?

13:27.264 --> 13:28.741
Well I was kind of bored, so I thought

13:28.765 --> 13:30.885
it'd be fun to run
every single test I could think of.

13:30.934 --> 13:32.428
I was almost to a rape kit...

13:32.519 --> 13:34.974
I mentioned
that I was a little bored earlier, right?

13:35.063 --> 13:38.266
- Yeah, we noticed, Abs.
- What the hell is it?

13:38.358 --> 13:40.066
I'm building a model of Gallipoli.

13:40.151 --> 13:42.689
- See, these guys over here...
- Why?

13:42.779 --> 13:46.314
Because I like the way it sounds.
Gallipoli. Gallipoli.

13:46.408 --> 13:48.815
- Gallipoli. Gallipoli. Gallipoli. Gallipoli...
- Stop.

13:48.910 --> 13:52.326
- Is this one a Turk or an Anzac?
- Actually, he's...

13:53.415 --> 13:55.039
What'd you find?

13:56.001 --> 13:59.583
Atlas' DNA was on the cigarette.
So most likely it's his.

13:59.671 --> 14:02.340
- That's it?
- I wasn't finished yet, Tony.

14:02.424 --> 14:04.665
I also found high concentrations
of ephedrine,

14:04.759 --> 14:06.551
dihydrocodeine and caffeine.

14:06.636 --> 14:09.092
- Sound familiar?
- Bron.

14:09.180 --> 14:10.616
And from the way it was concentrated

14:10.640 --> 14:13.012
it looks like he ingested enough
to knock out a racehorse.

14:13.101 --> 14:15.972
- Bron?
- It's a mixture of speed and codeine.

14:16.062 --> 14:18.221
It's illegal here,
but available over-the-counter

14:18.315 --> 14:20.521
in the Philippines and Okinawa, Japan.

14:20.609 --> 14:21.854
Okinawa?

14:24.195 --> 14:26.271
That was Major Sacco's
last duty station.

14:26.364 --> 14:28.050
Check out the ride.
We're going to Quantico.

14:28.074 --> 14:29.450
Boss. Rush hour.

14:29.534 --> 14:32.701
Real bad idea to get
on the road right about now.

14:32.787 --> 14:34.330
I'll be outside.

14:34.539 --> 14:36.828
- Good job, Abby.
- Thanks, Kate.

14:38.376 --> 14:41.461
- Abby, still bored?
- Well, yeah, maybe a little.

14:41.546 --> 14:44.713
Well, I think I have a more constructive
way for you to spend your time.

14:44.799 --> 14:47.125
- I need some help.
- Okay.

14:47.218 --> 14:49.045
By the way, Gallipoli

14:49.554 --> 14:51.712
was an amphibious operation.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.722
It's on Styrofoam, so it'll float.

14:59.397 --> 15:02.149
Rush hour.
Kind of a misnomer if you ask me.

15:02.233 --> 15:03.396
I didn't.

15:03.485 --> 15:06.236
I mean, it's not like anybody's
really rushing anywhere

15:06.321 --> 15:08.610
and it always takes more than an hour.

15:08.698 --> 15:10.939
- They should call it like...
- "Shut up and sit there...

15:10.992 --> 15:13.068
"before I shoot you hour."

15:14.496 --> 15:17.413
I was thinking of something
a little shorter.

15:21.836 --> 15:23.959
- That's littering.
- Bite me.

15:25.423 --> 15:28.258
No, I'm still here. Thanks, Corporal.

15:29.928 --> 15:33.094
- Major Sacco is in the field right now.
- Doing what?

15:33.181 --> 15:35.968
According to his office,
disarming a bomb.

15:40.814 --> 15:44.432
- All right. We've got five minutes here.
- Looks like closed circuit.

15:44.526 --> 15:47.064
Five minutes I can disarm a nuke sub.

15:47.153 --> 15:49.276
Checking for secondary initiators.

15:49.364 --> 15:51.606
- We are clear.
- Thank you, sir.

15:52.033 --> 15:53.314
Watch and learn, my friend.

15:53.410 --> 15:55.782
See, most people prefer
the blue wire. Me?

15:55.870 --> 15:57.495
I'm partial to...

15:58.456 --> 16:02.454
- What the hell did you just do?
- Nothing. I didn't touch nothing.

16:06.881 --> 16:08.506
Way to go, MacGyver.

16:08.591 --> 16:11.592
If that were real, we'd be washing you
off the streets of Baghdad right now.

16:11.678 --> 16:15.545
Never assume that a timer is accurate.
The bad guys watch movies, too.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.597
- Yes, sir.
- Major Sacco!

16:18.101 --> 16:21.102
Special agent Gibbs, NCIS.
We need to talk.

16:23.690 --> 16:25.267
You know, it wouldn't surprise me

16:25.358 --> 16:27.600
if Atlas showed up tomorrow,
still hung-over.

16:27.694 --> 16:30.730
- He pulled a disappearing act before?
- Never this long,

16:30.822 --> 16:33.111
but he's had some alcohol-related
problems in the past.

16:33.199 --> 16:36.011
You've got a missing Marine, Major.
You don't seem too concerned about it.

16:36.035 --> 16:39.202
My only concern right now is getting
my men ready to deploy to Iraq.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.958
What about the gunny? He deployable?

16:42.041 --> 16:43.584
Unfortunately.

16:45.295 --> 16:49.458
I've served with Atlas before. In my
opinion, we're better off without him.

16:49.549 --> 16:52.122
- Yeah? Why's that?
- He's a marginal Marine.

16:52.218 --> 16:54.579
Seems like the two of you
had some personal problems, Major.

16:54.637 --> 16:58.006
- You could say that, Agent Todd.
- Tell me about them.

16:58.641 --> 17:01.078
If you're interested, you can
read about it in my record book.

17:01.102 --> 17:04.803
I have. You two got in a fistfight
in '92. About what?

17:04.897 --> 17:06.143
Nothing.

17:06.273 --> 17:10.402
A couple of my men got drunk one night.
Atlas took a swing at me. I overreacted.

17:10.487 --> 17:12.487
Sir, demo's ready.
They're waiting on your command.

17:12.530 --> 17:15.200
Roger that, Corporal. We only have
this range for another hour.

17:15.282 --> 17:16.528
When you find Atlas,

17:16.617 --> 17:20.152
let him know that I have
a charge sheet waiting for him.

17:22.707 --> 17:24.829
- He's hiding something.
- Oh, yeah.

17:24.917 --> 17:28.287
- The question is what?
- You two might want to cover your...

17:33.176 --> 17:34.374
ears.

17:46.898 --> 17:50.018
Boss, is there a reason why
you always take these back roads?

17:50.109 --> 17:53.194
- Or do you just hate us?
- I hate traffic more.

17:53.863 --> 17:57.030
- I think I'm going to puke.
- Roll down the window!

18:01.037 --> 18:02.697
You better answer this.

18:03.748 --> 18:05.408
Hey Gibbs, it's me, Abby. I've got...

18:05.500 --> 18:07.243
- It's Kate.
- Hey, Kate.

18:07.335 --> 18:10.253
- Where's the boss man?
- He's driving.

18:10.338 --> 18:12.046
We should be back soon.

18:12.131 --> 18:14.705
Is he taking you on one of his
special shortcuts?

18:14.801 --> 18:17.126
If that's what you want to call it.

18:17.220 --> 18:18.500
What's up?

18:18.596 --> 18:21.681
Well, Gibbs asked me to do some
background on Atlas and Sacco

18:21.766 --> 18:23.344
and I found something interesting.

18:23.434 --> 18:27.384
You're gonna have to speak up!
Gibbs is apparently trying to kill us!

18:27.689 --> 18:32.066
Three other marines have gone missing
from EOD units in the last eight years.

18:32.193 --> 18:33.356
What's she saying?

18:33.444 --> 18:35.982
Three Marines have gone missing
from EOD units.

18:36.072 --> 18:38.859
- Why didn't we hear that?
- Why didn't we hear about it?

18:38.950 --> 18:42.995
They're carried as deserters by
the Marine Corps rolls after 30 days.

18:43.079 --> 18:44.538
They're considered deserters.

18:44.622 --> 18:47.576
And they all have two things
in common with Atlas.

18:47.667 --> 18:50.917
They all served together
in the Philippines in 1992.

18:51.004 --> 18:54.455
And their Platoon Commander
was Joe Sacco.

19:16.570 --> 19:20.105
Corporal Tom O'Conner,
reported UA on August 2nd, '96.

19:21.116 --> 19:24.781
Sergeant Rick Hall.
Reported UA March 11th, '98.

19:25.120 --> 19:29.118
Staff Sergeant John Mohs,
reported UA on December 10th, 2000.

19:29.625 --> 19:32.910
And now, Gunnery Sergeant Atlas,
five days ago.

19:33.003 --> 19:36.123
All four served in the Philippines in '92
with Joe Sacco

19:36.256 --> 19:38.794
and all four subsequently
disappeared without a trace.

19:38.884 --> 19:40.904
So why is it no one else
picked up on this before us?

19:40.928 --> 19:43.679
Well, we wouldn't have picked up
on it if Abby wasn't bored.

19:43.764 --> 19:45.158
These men were considered deserters.

19:45.182 --> 19:47.139
Nobody ever connected them
until we did today.

19:47.225 --> 19:49.183
So let's pick up Sacco.
Find out what's going on.

19:49.269 --> 19:51.061
- Not yet.
- Well, I think he's right, Gibbs.

19:51.146 --> 19:53.499
I mean, we could be dealing
with a potential serial killer here.

19:53.523 --> 19:54.899
What if it's not Sacco?

19:54.983 --> 19:58.233
Well, if it's not him, then he's probably
the next one on the missing list.

20:03.825 --> 20:06.862
I want everything there is
on that EOD team from '92.

20:06.954 --> 20:09.623
Kate, get with Abby
and start where she left off.

20:09.706 --> 20:11.865
Tony, you concentrate on Sacco.

20:11.959 --> 20:15.125
I want everything
from his birth until right now.

20:15.921 --> 20:17.629
You remember the good old days, Kate?

20:17.714 --> 20:18.829
What good old days?

20:18.924 --> 20:22.091
When Gibbs would confide in us
and treat us like peers.

20:22.177 --> 20:23.208
No.

20:24.721 --> 20:26.880
Good, I thought I was the only one.

20:45.158 --> 20:46.866
- Why?
- Why not?

21:02.134 --> 21:06.630
- Hey, Kate. I was just about to call you.
- Gibbs wants... Wants me to...

21:09.391 --> 21:10.885
They're boats.

21:10.976 --> 21:14.641
I was recently informed that Gallipoli
was an amphib operation.

21:15.772 --> 21:16.935
Okay.

21:17.024 --> 21:20.024
So what can you tell me
about Sacco's old unit?

21:20.318 --> 21:22.892
In '92, we were closing the base
in the Philippines

21:22.988 --> 21:24.945
and Sacco's EOD team was in charge

21:25.032 --> 21:27.653
of clearing out
the ammunition storage dumps.

21:27.743 --> 21:29.486
Do we know how big his unit was?

21:29.578 --> 21:31.570
We could ask him,
but in my experience,

21:31.663 --> 21:33.205
most men lie about that point.

21:34.041 --> 21:35.914
There were six of them.

21:36.168 --> 21:37.959
Okay, so if there were six, that means...

21:38.045 --> 21:40.251
There's one of them
still running around out there.

21:40.338 --> 21:44.502
Which is why I was gonna call you.
Meet Corporal Mark Cohen.

21:44.801 --> 21:46.794
- Where's he stationed?
- He's not.

21:46.970 --> 21:49.841
He got the big chicken dinner
back in 1999.

21:51.558 --> 21:54.678
- What, Abby?
- Bad Conduct Discharge.

21:54.770 --> 21:57.261
The Marine Corps
doesn't keep track after they separate.

21:57.355 --> 21:59.728
So what was the chicken dinner for?

21:59.858 --> 22:01.981
Assaulting his Company Commander.

22:02.069 --> 22:03.860
I think we just found
our second suspect.

22:03.945 --> 22:06.401
Not quite. I've been running his social

22:06.490 --> 22:08.778
and I haven't been able
to find him anywhere.

22:08.867 --> 22:11.738
I always feel like Mr Rogers
when I leave here.

22:11.828 --> 22:14.070
- Where are you going?
- Gibbs didn't tell you?

22:14.164 --> 22:18.078
- Tell me what?
- I have a party to go to.

22:18.502 --> 22:20.625
How did you get him to agree to that?

22:20.712 --> 22:22.171
I asked him.

22:22.964 --> 22:25.420
So if you need me, call me.

22:25.592 --> 22:26.837
And just

22:27.094 --> 22:31.257
disregard any sounds that you may
or may not hear in the background.

22:46.780 --> 22:47.811
DiNozzo!

22:47.906 --> 22:49.217
You're gonna have to
speak louder, boss.

22:49.241 --> 22:52.028
I haven't been able to hear anything
since that explosion yesterday.

22:52.119 --> 22:54.788
Find Kate.
I want a full briefing in 20 minutes.

22:54.871 --> 22:56.152
You got it.

22:58.416 --> 22:59.448
Kate?

23:00.836 --> 23:03.457
- Kate!
- What?

23:06.174 --> 23:08.001
It's time to wake up.

23:12.430 --> 23:14.138
I feel like hell.

23:14.474 --> 23:17.048
Yeah, you don't look too good, either.

23:22.399 --> 23:23.478
Who?

23:24.442 --> 23:26.020
Who is...

23:35.370 --> 23:36.615
My God.

23:40.500 --> 23:41.959
I didn't know!

23:42.127 --> 23:44.119
I swear I didn't know!

23:45.672 --> 23:47.629
You have to believe me!

23:51.970 --> 23:53.844
Kate, what do we got?

23:54.222 --> 23:57.508
How can you eat that stuff?
It's 7:30 in the morning.

23:57.684 --> 23:59.059
Practice.

23:59.477 --> 24:01.636
- It's good. You want some?
- I'll pass.

24:01.730 --> 24:04.137
We're still trying to track down
former Corporal Cohen.

24:04.232 --> 24:08.941
- He left a trail till 2002, then nothing.
- Tony?

24:09.029 --> 24:10.772
Sacco was stationed
in the same vicinity

24:10.864 --> 24:12.821
with all four Marines who went UA.

24:12.908 --> 24:14.318
Got to be more than a coincidence.

24:14.409 --> 24:16.304
What'd we learn about the fight
from his record book?

24:16.328 --> 24:19.578
I called the Colonel he was working for
in '92. He didn't remember much.

24:19.664 --> 24:22.036
Could have been because
it was 2:00 a.m. When I called him.

24:22.125 --> 24:23.833
- But you never know.
- What'd he say?

24:23.919 --> 24:25.543
He thinks it was over a woman.

24:25.629 --> 24:27.289
An all-nighter, this is all I get?

24:27.380 --> 24:29.207
We're recreating
a 12-year history, Gibbs.

24:29.299 --> 24:30.627
- What'd you expect?
- More.

24:30.717 --> 24:32.674
Great, then bring Major Sacco
in for questioning.

24:32.761 --> 24:35.334
Give me something
I can nail him with and I will.

24:35.430 --> 24:38.764
- I'll get it for you.
- Yeah? How?

24:38.850 --> 24:42.468
Let me shadow him for a couple days.
If he's got a screw loose, I'll know it.

24:42.562 --> 24:44.555
He might lead us to Atlas.

24:47.484 --> 24:48.515
All right.

24:48.610 --> 24:51.505
Listen, boss, I'm telling you, it beats
sitting around here doing nothing.

24:51.529 --> 24:55.397
- If I'm out there, trying to find him...
- He said "okay," Tony.

24:58.787 --> 25:00.806
I'm telling you, that explosion
really messed my hearing up.

25:00.830 --> 25:01.862
I'll go with him.

25:01.957 --> 25:04.827
No, no, I need you here.
DiNozzo, you call in every hour.

25:04.918 --> 25:08.536
You forget one time, call in late,
don't bother coming back.

25:11.466 --> 25:14.171
Look, just don't take any chances, okay?

25:14.261 --> 25:16.981
I mean, if we're right about Sacco,
he's got more than a screw loose.

25:17.013 --> 25:19.338
Here I was thinking you didn't care.

25:19.432 --> 25:21.425
It's not about caring.
If anything happens to you

25:21.518 --> 25:23.594
I'm gonna be stuck working
here with Gibbs alone.

25:23.687 --> 25:25.145
He's not that bad.

25:25.230 --> 25:27.353
- A little grumpy sometimes...
- Hey, DiNozzo!

25:27.440 --> 25:28.685
You still here?

25:28.775 --> 25:31.444
Then again, you may be
on to something.

25:34.114 --> 25:37.280
So I found Cohen. I think we can
cross him off the suspect list.

25:37.367 --> 25:38.612
He's dead.

25:38.785 --> 25:39.864
How?

25:40.203 --> 25:44.117
They found him last year in
a sewer system in Old Town Alexandria

25:44.207 --> 25:45.370
chained to a wall.

25:45.458 --> 25:47.285
Not a pretty picture.

25:47.836 --> 25:50.409
Looks like he was
down there for awhile.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.775
The locals are sending us
copies of the crime scene report,

25:52.799 --> 25:55.255
autopsy and evidence of the scene.
It's a cold case.

25:55.343 --> 25:56.672
Not anymore.

25:57.429 --> 26:00.346
- Hey, where's Tony?
- I've got him tailing Sacco.

26:00.682 --> 26:01.927
Alone?

26:02.100 --> 26:04.245
He does his best work
when there's not an audience around.

26:04.269 --> 26:07.021
- I got a weird feeling.
- Abs, you always have a weird feeling.

26:07.105 --> 26:10.474
- I know, but this one's different.
- He can take care of himself.

26:10.567 --> 26:12.974
You let me know
when those records show up.

26:13.069 --> 26:15.394
Got it. What do you think, Kate?

26:16.239 --> 26:19.988
Well, I just think you're suffering from
the effects of your party last night.

26:20.076 --> 26:22.532
- All I drank was Red Bull.
- How many?

26:23.663 --> 26:24.694
18.

26:29.294 --> 26:31.370
- DiNozzo.
- What's the word?

26:31.463 --> 26:34.132
Sacco just left the base.
I think he's heading home for the night.

26:34.215 --> 26:35.295
We found Cohen.

26:35.383 --> 26:37.542
- Where?
- Chained to a sewer pipe.

26:37.635 --> 26:39.011
He's dead.

26:39.262 --> 26:41.385
Looks like we're running all out
of suspects.

26:41.473 --> 26:44.177
- Yeah, sure looks that way.
- You want me to pick him up?

26:44.267 --> 26:45.346
Negative.

26:45.435 --> 26:47.059
You just keep him under surveillance.

26:47.145 --> 26:48.556
Whoa, hold on a sec.

26:48.646 --> 26:52.312
You are not gonna believe
where he's pulling in right now.

26:52.609 --> 26:54.732
Hammersmith's Country Bar.

26:54.986 --> 26:56.528
Okay, maybe you will.

26:56.613 --> 26:58.902
We're getting
a search warrant for his house.

26:58.990 --> 27:01.944
- You let me know when he leaves.
- Roger that.

27:02.202 --> 27:03.577
DiNozzo,

27:03.870 --> 27:05.412
watch your six.

27:05.663 --> 27:06.862
Always.

27:24.265 --> 27:26.057
What're you drinking?

27:27.143 --> 27:29.978
I don't suppose
you have any sarsaparilla?

27:31.147 --> 27:33.519
- How about a ginger ale?
- Sure.

27:34.692 --> 27:36.103
Hey, cowboy!

27:37.112 --> 27:40.812
- You here for business or my pleasure?
- One ginger ale.

27:41.408 --> 27:42.653
Business.

27:43.660 --> 27:46.577
- You haven't found your Marine.
- Not yet.

27:48.039 --> 27:50.079
Maybe I can help you look?

27:55.046 --> 27:58.878
This is everything the Alexandria PD
found on Corporal Cohen.

28:05.765 --> 28:07.509
That's interesting.

28:08.393 --> 28:11.310
According to Cohen's records,
he was Jewish.

28:11.396 --> 28:13.851
- What about Sacco?
- He's Baptist.

28:24.868 --> 28:26.410
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

28:27.912 --> 28:29.241
- Hey!
- Sorry.

28:30.415 --> 28:31.909
Great.

28:32.041 --> 28:35.078
Debbie Sue, it's me, Bobby Lee.
Mr Burt's English class.

28:35.170 --> 28:37.209
- Who?
- Come on...

28:40.175 --> 28:41.373
It's my bad.

28:41.468 --> 28:45.761
I thought you were someone else.
Take care of her. She's a real keeper.

28:57.901 --> 28:58.932
Hey.

28:59.110 --> 29:01.269
- Gibbs.
- What's up?

29:01.362 --> 29:03.320
Sacco just left the bar.

29:09.496 --> 29:11.369
I'm not feeling so well.

29:11.581 --> 29:13.372
Tony? You okay?

29:14.542 --> 29:16.665
I think I screwed up, boss.

29:21.174 --> 29:23.131
Hey! DiNozzo, can you hear me?

29:26.179 --> 29:27.341
Tony.

29:35.772 --> 29:38.014
Tony! Tony, do you hear me?

29:38.107 --> 29:39.934
We're coming for you!

29:49.994 --> 29:51.572
Welcome to hell.

30:23.144 --> 30:25.183
All right, that's it.

30:25.897 --> 30:27.416
I've interviewed everyone in the area.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.479
No one saw Tony
after he came out of the bar.

30:29.567 --> 30:31.476
You don't think he's...

30:33.154 --> 30:34.814
Yeah, me neither.

30:37.533 --> 30:38.696
Sacco.

30:39.827 --> 30:42.614
We have people at his house,
an APB out on his vehicle.

30:42.705 --> 30:44.600
It's only a matter of time
before we pick him up.

30:44.624 --> 30:47.328
Yeah, well, time's the one thing
we don't have.

30:47.919 --> 30:49.876
Gibbs for Director.

30:53.382 --> 30:54.793
Only a week?

30:57.220 --> 31:00.055
It feels like... Feels like months.

31:00.973 --> 31:03.547
Hey, hey, hey.
Conserve your strength, okay?

31:03.893 --> 31:06.384
- You're gonna need it.
- For what?

31:09.398 --> 31:12.518
- For when I get us out of here.
- You got a plan?

31:13.069 --> 31:16.105
Of course I do. I found you, didn't I?

31:16.864 --> 31:20.233
Granted, the escape part's
still a little fuzzy, but...

31:20.660 --> 31:21.858
I just got here.

31:21.953 --> 31:25.571
Unless you're a blacksmith,
I'm pretty much screwed here.

31:25.665 --> 31:27.657
You need to think positive, gunny.

31:27.750 --> 31:31.084
You're right. I'm positive I'm screwed.

31:33.464 --> 31:36.999
A sense of humour's good.
You're gonna need that.

31:37.218 --> 31:39.970
Okay, let's get this chain off your leg.

31:40.596 --> 31:41.627
How?

31:42.765 --> 31:44.674
- Rule nine.
- What?

31:45.434 --> 31:48.388
You know, those rules they teach
you guys in the Marine Corps.

31:48.479 --> 31:49.854
What rules?

31:51.691 --> 31:55.273
I always suspected Gibbs
was making that stuff up. Well...

31:57.613 --> 31:59.107
Rule 9 is:

31:59.490 --> 32:01.317
Never go anywhere...

32:03.995 --> 32:05.619
without a knife.

32:07.373 --> 32:11.122
Even if you get it off,
how do we get out of the room?

32:14.630 --> 32:16.955
One thing at a time, huh, gunny?

32:20.761 --> 32:24.213
We're dealing with a serial killer
who is methodical and patient.

32:24.307 --> 32:26.976
He spread his kills out
over an eight-year period.

32:27.059 --> 32:29.385
And if we go by Cohen's case,
he's into making them suffer.

32:29.478 --> 32:32.479
- But why'd he go after Tony?
- He saw something tonight,

32:32.565 --> 32:35.103
something Major Psycho
doesn't want us to know about.

32:35.192 --> 32:36.355
Then why didn't Tony tell us?

32:36.444 --> 32:38.755
Because maybe he didn't think
it was important at the time.

32:38.779 --> 32:40.424
Have we heard anything
from Agent DiNozzo yet?

32:40.448 --> 32:43.402
McGee, you're late.
Kate, bring him up to speed.

32:43.534 --> 32:45.443
Where can I set up shop?

32:45.536 --> 32:48.407
- Take Tony's desk.
- You don't think he'll mind?

32:48.497 --> 32:50.898
I think Tony's got other things
on his mind right now, McGee.

32:57.548 --> 32:58.877
It's all right.

33:02.678 --> 33:04.967
All right,
you're gonna need to carry this.

33:05.056 --> 33:06.384
All right?

33:08.100 --> 33:10.307
I need to confess something.

33:10.645 --> 33:11.759
Well,

33:12.063 --> 33:14.435
when we get out of here,
I'll find you a priest.

33:14.523 --> 33:15.555
No.

33:17.652 --> 33:19.194
I deserve this.

33:19.487 --> 33:20.981
I belong here.

33:22.198 --> 33:24.903
- You don't.
- No one deserves this, gunny.

33:25.493 --> 33:27.236
It was an accident.

33:28.829 --> 33:32.033
- He must have found out about it.
- Found out what?

33:34.251 --> 33:36.789
We killed four girls, Agent DiNozzo.

33:39.090 --> 33:42.007
And Major Sacco was in love
with one of them.

33:46.347 --> 33:50.214
I reviewed Corporal Cohen's
autopsy results from 2002.

33:50.309 --> 33:52.717
His body tissue had high concentrations

33:52.812 --> 33:55.219
of insect venom,
honey bees to be exact.

33:55.314 --> 33:57.888
- Did it kill him?
- Unfortunately, no.

33:57.984 --> 34:00.356
Our young friend starved to death

34:00.444 --> 34:02.900
and judging by the fat
and muscle tissue loss,

34:02.989 --> 34:06.073
it happened over a period of weeks,
if not months.

34:06.158 --> 34:09.159
That's the first good news
I've heard all day.

34:10.621 --> 34:14.156
It means there's a chance
Tony and Atlas are still alive.

34:15.083 --> 34:17.041
You'll find him, Jethro.

34:18.504 --> 34:21.172
That a question or a statement, Duck?

34:24.510 --> 34:26.882
A little bit of both, I'm afraid.

34:33.143 --> 34:34.851
Aw, damn it.

34:36.022 --> 34:37.599
Tell me more about the girls.

34:37.690 --> 34:41.522
The base was closing.
We all had girlfriends out in the town.

34:41.610 --> 34:44.730
- We didn't want to leave them.
- So you decided to kill them?

34:44.822 --> 34:46.020
Makes sense.

34:46.114 --> 34:48.357
They would have been better off
if we had.

34:48.451 --> 34:49.696
Instead,

34:49.869 --> 34:52.656
we tried to smuggle them
back to the States

34:53.205 --> 34:55.032
inside shipping containers.

34:55.123 --> 34:58.327
- You mailed your girlfriends home?
- Shipped.

34:59.378 --> 35:02.379
But Lieutenant Sacco
changed our orders at the last minute.

35:02.465 --> 35:05.549
He split us up
and put us all on different ships.

35:05.634 --> 35:09.300
We all assumed that
one of us was on the one with the girls.

35:09.680 --> 35:11.055
Oh my God.

35:14.643 --> 35:17.265
They were padlocked from the outside.

35:18.022 --> 35:21.272
They only had enough food and water
for a few days.

35:25.571 --> 35:28.489
Everyone thought
they stowed away themselves.

35:28.866 --> 35:30.360
But it was us.

35:32.203 --> 35:34.444
We killed them, Agent DiNozzo.

35:36.165 --> 35:38.656
- One of them was Sacco's girl?
- Was.

35:39.960 --> 35:41.752
She left him for me.

35:42.254 --> 35:44.959
That's probably why he saved me
for last.

36:21.168 --> 36:22.828
What do you got?

36:23.504 --> 36:26.608
I pulled a partial fingerprint off the
silver cross found on Corporal Cohen's body.

36:26.632 --> 36:27.830
- Major Sacco's?
- No.

36:27.925 --> 36:30.048
It's not listed in any database.

36:30.136 --> 36:31.655
Abs, you could have told me that
on the phone.

36:31.679 --> 36:35.012
- I know, but I did find a match.
- We just don't have a name yet.

36:35.099 --> 36:36.807
A match from where?

36:37.643 --> 36:40.763
The reporter's credit card
receipt from the bar.

36:41.313 --> 36:43.721
She wasn't after a story.
She was working with Sacco.

36:43.816 --> 36:46.900
Well, that's one possibility.
I recommend that we run a test...

36:46.986 --> 36:48.148
Gibbs.

36:48.946 --> 36:51.235
Secure the area. We're on our way.

36:51.323 --> 36:53.731
Manassas PD located Sacco's car.

36:53.826 --> 36:56.578
McGee, get me an arrest warrant
on Carol Powers.

36:56.662 --> 36:59.331
You got it, boss. I mean, Agent Gibbs.

36:59.790 --> 37:02.162
- Let's roll.
- Kate,

37:02.251 --> 37:04.244
bring him back, all right?

37:12.178 --> 37:15.214
I think I got it this time. Come on.

37:16.015 --> 37:18.932
Come on, baby. There you go.

37:25.816 --> 37:27.441
I won't make it.

37:28.777 --> 37:32.478
I can... I can barely stay conscious.

37:32.823 --> 37:35.065
I must have read your file wrong, gunny.

37:35.159 --> 37:38.113
- It said you were a Marine.
- I am a Marine.

37:38.621 --> 37:41.242
If you say so. Most Marines I know...

37:42.791 --> 37:44.416
they don't quit.

37:54.303 --> 37:56.841
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

37:57.181 --> 37:59.008
We think they're down
in the sewer system.

37:59.099 --> 38:01.222
I got two canine units on the way.

38:01.352 --> 38:03.344
Who's this other car belong to?

38:03.437 --> 38:07.020
Plates came back stolen.
Looks like it was abandoned here.

38:07.191 --> 38:10.145
- We're going in.
- I'd wait for the dogs.

38:10.236 --> 38:14.529
Was down there once looking for a kid,
got lost for almost three hours.

38:14.823 --> 38:16.483
We don't get lost.

38:39.390 --> 38:40.469
Gunny!

38:41.475 --> 38:42.755
Gunny!

38:46.563 --> 38:47.939
Gunny!

38:48.607 --> 38:50.232
Where'd you go?

38:54.238 --> 38:55.436
Gunny!

38:57.866 --> 39:00.357
Gunny, I know you're here!

39:10.254 --> 39:12.163
Where the hell are you?

39:12.673 --> 39:14.915
Thank God, Tony's still alive.

39:15.092 --> 39:18.176
Who else do you know
pisses people off like that?

39:18.429 --> 39:19.591
Gunny!

39:23.392 --> 39:25.965
Stop. I have to stop.

39:26.061 --> 39:27.140
Stop.

39:28.772 --> 39:30.148
- Listen.
- Gunny!

39:30.232 --> 39:32.141
You have 10 seconds, okay?

39:34.820 --> 39:37.856
Gunny, where the hell are you?

39:38.282 --> 39:40.607
Didn't we already pass by here?

39:42.703 --> 39:43.866
Gunny!

39:43.954 --> 39:45.496
Okay, come on.

39:46.123 --> 39:48.828
- I can't.
- I'll carry you if I have to, all right?

39:48.917 --> 39:49.997
- Come on.
- Leave me.

39:50.085 --> 39:51.829
- Come on.
- Leave me.

39:53.505 --> 39:54.620
Tony?

39:57.426 --> 39:58.837
- Gibbs.
- DiNozzo.

39:58.927 --> 40:02.842
- What are you doing down here?
- What do you think I'm doing here?

40:02.931 --> 40:05.173
- Is that Kate?
- Yeah.

40:05.267 --> 40:06.346
How'd you get over there?

40:06.435 --> 40:09.056
I'm kind of winging it.
Atlas is in pretty bad shape.

40:09.146 --> 40:11.851
Stay where you are,
we'll work our way to you.

40:11.940 --> 40:13.980
I can't. Sacco's right behind us.

40:14.068 --> 40:17.318
Okay, go. Go. Keep moving.
We'll catch up to you.

40:18.947 --> 40:20.739
We got to go, all right?

40:20.824 --> 40:22.532
Come on, come on.

40:31.085 --> 40:33.955
Gunny! If you're down here, answer me.

40:40.427 --> 40:41.756
All right.

40:42.596 --> 40:44.221
Hang in there, Marine.

40:44.306 --> 40:45.966
We're going make it.

40:47.768 --> 40:49.262
There you go.

40:51.939 --> 40:55.438
My father was right.
I'm going to end up in the gutter.

40:59.822 --> 41:01.020
You?

41:02.658 --> 41:04.235
Why didn't you stop?

41:04.326 --> 41:06.864
Put down the weapon
and we'll talk about it.

41:06.954 --> 41:08.781
You think I'm going to shoot you?

41:08.872 --> 41:11.659
- It crossed my mind.
- I followed her here.

41:11.959 --> 41:15.125
I didn't want to believe it, but it's true.
She's completely insane.

41:15.212 --> 41:17.357
Look, we got to get him out of
here before she finds us.

41:17.381 --> 41:18.412
Who?

41:24.263 --> 41:25.971
That would be me.

41:28.308 --> 41:31.144
You might want to lose
that knife, cowboy.

41:34.148 --> 41:36.140
You don't recognise me,
do you, Sergeant Bill?

41:36.233 --> 41:37.513
Vanessa.

41:37.860 --> 41:40.018
- I thought...
- I was dead, I know.

41:40.112 --> 41:41.523
You all did,

41:41.947 --> 41:43.489
except for Sacco.

41:43.574 --> 41:46.195
He's the one who found me half-alive.

41:49.830 --> 41:50.993
My God.

41:57.212 --> 41:59.882
It's all right, I've got you. All right...

42:06.305 --> 42:08.262
At first I was grateful,

42:08.974 --> 42:11.050
but then he turned out to be
like the rest of them.

42:11.143 --> 42:13.135
He wanted to control me.

42:13.395 --> 42:15.352
You're the one that killed
all those Marines?

42:15.439 --> 42:16.637
Not yet.

42:22.362 --> 42:25.814
- It's the waitress from the bar.
- We take it slow.

42:25.908 --> 42:28.114
You think she's going to shoot,

42:28.202 --> 42:29.910
you take her out.

42:33.165 --> 42:37.459
- You don't want to do this.
- I've been doing this for eight years.

42:40.380 --> 42:42.088
I was the youngest.

42:43.467 --> 42:47.050
They gave me all their food, and slowly,
each one of them died.

42:47.137 --> 42:50.304
Do you know what it's like
to watch your friends die?

42:50.390 --> 42:53.095
To sleep with their corpses? Do you?

42:54.561 --> 42:57.017
We can't let you do this, Vanessa.

42:57.397 --> 42:58.477
We?

42:58.815 --> 42:59.930
Drop it!

43:02.027 --> 43:03.984
Yeah, my friends.

43:13.539 --> 43:15.745
Admit it,
you were worried about me, right?

43:15.832 --> 43:18.584
You don't have to say anything. I know.

43:18.961 --> 43:21.878
Okay, I want you to say it.
You care, right?

43:23.465 --> 43:25.790
So you're saying you don't care?

43:28.136 --> 43:30.544
Tony, as far as I'm concerned,

43:33.183 --> 43:34.975
you're irreplaceable.

43:35.185 --> 43:36.560
I knew it.

43:37.354 --> 43:39.726
I knew behind the whole Marine thing
you really are,

43:39.815 --> 43:41.642
- at heart...
- Forget about it, McGee.

43:41.733 --> 43:43.358
He's still alive.
