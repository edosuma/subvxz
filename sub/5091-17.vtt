Hey, what do we got?

04:14.307 --> 04:15.774
Hey, Danny.

04:15.775 --> 04:18.110
Call came in as
a 54 unconscious.

04:18.111 --> 04:19.545
By the time the
sector car arrived,

04:19.546 --> 04:21.446
the guy was already dead.
Who called it in?

04:21.447 --> 04:23.365
Janitor. Works over there in
that building across there

04:23.366 --> 04:25.017
and, uh, he found
the body at 0330.

04:25.018 --> 04:26.451
All right, where's
the janitor?

04:26.452 --> 04:28.687
He had to run home and get his
grandkids ready for school.

04:28.688 --> 04:30.021
What?
Yeah.

04:30.022 --> 04:31.856
You let a witness
walk away from a homicide?

04:31.857 --> 04:33.876
Dan, come on. We got the guy's
pedigree, okay? We know where he works.

04:33.877 --> 04:35.861
Danny, it's not like the
vic's going anywhere.

04:35.862 --> 04:37.079
I don't care if it's the mayor,

04:37.080 --> 04:38.830
you don't let a witness
walk away from a homicide.

04:38.831 --> 04:40.766
Now let's check
the surrounding blocks

04:40.767 --> 04:42.167
for surveillance video, all right? Yeah.

04:42.168 --> 04:43.569
Where's this door lead?

04:43.570 --> 04:44.970
That's the, uh,
Brass 9 Club.

04:44.971 --> 04:47.206
Is anyone in there
that I could speak to?

04:47.207 --> 04:48.540
Nah, it closed at 3:00 a.m.

04:48.541 --> 04:50.342
They were all gone
by the time the call came in.

04:53.980 --> 04:56.682
"Semper Fi."

04:56.683 --> 05:00.068
This guy's a Marine.

05:00.069 --> 05:02.271
Jack...

05:02.272 --> 05:03.605
this guy's a Marine.

05:03.606 --> 05:05.073
Really?

05:05.074 --> 05:06.658
James Phelps.
See if you can run down

05:06.659 --> 05:09.027
the next of kin from
that, all right? Yeah.

05:09.028 --> 05:10.896
Hey, where's the wagon? We're waiting.

05:10.897 --> 05:13.232
How long you been
waiting? Long time, Dan.

05:13.233 --> 05:16.201
Yeah, it's Detective
First Grade Daniel Reagan.

05:16.202 --> 05:17.669
We're waiting on a M.E. wagon

05:17.670 --> 05:19.871

what's your holdup?

05:19.872 --> 05:21.072
I don't give a damn what...

05:21.073 --> 05:23.241
Hey, you get your ass
down here now, okay?

05:23.242 --> 05:25.844
I got a dead Marine
lying in an alley.

05:25.845 --> 05:28.013
Well, do better than your best!

05:29.799 --> 05:30.933
All right.

05:30.934 --> 05:33.218
That's not James Phelps.

05:33.219 --> 05:34.586
What?
I just ran him through

05:34.587 --> 05:37.489
HIDTA, and uh, Phelps was
killed in action

05:37.490 --> 05:38.790
in Afghanistan in 2009.

05:38.791 --> 05:41.276
Who the hell is this guy?

05:42.929 --> 05:45.163

a dead Marine's dog tags?

Morning.

06:20.397 --> 06:21.714
Nice surprise.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.882

Well, I'll enjoy

Ray Curston's column.

06:36.713 --> 06:37.997
He makes it

06:37.998 --> 06:40.466
sound like you're leveraging
all this hero stuff

06:40.467 --> 06:42.067
to make a run for City Hall.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.201
Where'd this come from?

06:43.202 --> 06:45.237
A poll came
out yesterday,

06:45.238 --> 06:46.739
showing that your
approval ratings

06:46.740 --> 06:47.973
are twice that of the mayor's.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.209
Well, a police
commissioner,

06:50.210 --> 06:51.477
if he's doing his job right,

06:51.478 --> 06:53.545
will always have higher
poll numbers than his mayor.

06:53.546 --> 06:56.048
I don't think the mayor
sees it that way.

06:56.049 --> 06:58.317
Not with double his numbers.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.451
You think he's behind this?

06:59.452 --> 07:02.087
It wouldn't surprise me.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.223
He doesn't like to stand
in anyone's shadow,

07:04.224 --> 07:05.791
and you've cast
a pretty long one,

07:05.792 --> 07:08.527
especially after the
assassination attempt.

07:08.528 --> 07:11.030
This is libel! Francis, what
are you going to do about it?

07:11.031 --> 07:13.599
Well, as your daughter first,

07:13.600 --> 07:16.702
and as a lawyer second,
I urge you not to respond.

07:16.703 --> 07:18.337
If I got upset every time

07:18.338 --> 07:20.272
somebody did a negative piece
about me, I'd be...

07:20.273 --> 07:21.140
The mayor?

07:21.141 --> 07:23.242
And I'm not.

07:24.411 --> 07:27.513
Okay, Dad, I know, but...
I know you.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.815
And if the mayor's going around
making you sound like a...

07:29.816 --> 07:31.283
glory hound,

07:31.284 --> 07:33.285
you're not going to
just sit there.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.753
So...

07:34.754 --> 07:36.422
what are you going to do?

07:38.808 --> 07:40.859
I'm going to finish my coffee.

07:40.860 --> 07:44.196
And then I'm going to enjoy
a nice ride into town

07:44.197 --> 07:46.331

07:48.234 --> 07:50.302
<i>How we doing</i>

07:50.303 --> 07:51.603

Uh...

07:51.604 --> 07:52.821
I have an expedite on it.

07:52.822 --> 07:54.907
If he was military, it's
gonna pop pretty quick.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.175
With that tattoo,
he was a Marine.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.743
You stay on top
of the prints, okay?

07:57.744 --> 07:58.627
Yeah. I'll go
check now.

07:58.628 --> 07:59.878
Hey, Reagan.

07:59.879 --> 08:01.997
It's the guy who found
your vic in the alley.

08:01.998 --> 08:03.015
Hey. Thanks for
coming down.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.383
Yeah.
You told

08:04.384 --> 08:06.552
the responding officers
this man was killed

08:06.553 --> 08:08.387
between 2:45 and 3:30,
is that right?

08:08.388 --> 08:09.755
Yeah. Okay. This man, the victim,

08:09.756 --> 08:12.491
did he have any beefs that you
know about, any problems

08:12.492 --> 08:13.859
with someone else
living in the street?

08:13.860 --> 08:14.993
Not that I ever saw.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.929
How about drug problems,
you ever see him using?

08:16.930 --> 08:19.531
Nah. Well, he was pretty
banged up, from the war,

08:19.532 --> 08:22.835
so... sometimes he gets
on the prescription meds.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.636
Okay. Anybody else
live in this alley?

08:24.637 --> 08:27.306
Just a woman,
a girl, really.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.441
Uh... maybe 20.

08:29.442 --> 08:30.576
Sissy.

08:30.577 --> 08:33.278
She was gone when
I came down and...

08:33.279 --> 08:35.080
and, uh, found the body.

08:35.081 --> 08:37.316
Okay. Him and this, this woman,
were they a couple?

08:37.317 --> 08:40.619
Nah. Nah, but he always
looked out for her.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.421
Can you do me a favor, you
work with our sketch artist,

08:42.422 --> 08:44.373
try to come up with a
description of Sissy? Yeah.

08:44.374 --> 08:45.674
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Thank you.

08:45.675 --> 08:48.594
You know, I came back from 'Nam,

08:48.595 --> 08:51.864
had a couple shaky years.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.332
I never hit the street.

08:53.333 --> 08:57.803
there
but for the grace of God.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.972
Amen to that, brother.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.074
Yeah.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.176
I got it. Come on.

09:09.866 --> 09:11.233
Hey.

09:11.234 --> 09:13.368
Prints came back from the
Department of Defense.

09:13.369 --> 09:15.821
We have a positive ID on
the vic. It's Michael Oates.

09:15.822 --> 09:18.924
No next of kin listed on
his military records,

09:18.925 --> 09:21.160
but there is
a Kimberly Lane

09:21.161 --> 09:23.262
that is listed as an
emergency contact. All right.

09:23.263 --> 09:25.230
Look, um, this guy was
a Marine brother, Jack.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.633
I'm gonna make the notification
on my own, all right?

09:30.303 --> 09:34.256
He was the most popular
kid in school.

09:34.257 --> 09:37.476
Everyone loved him.

09:39.345 --> 09:40.946
But he never had it easy.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.881
Why's that?

09:42.882 --> 09:44.917
His dad worked in
the freight yards.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.052
He was killed in an accident
when Michael was six.

09:47.053 --> 09:50.923
His mom died when he was
still in high school.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.692
He pretty much raised himself.

09:53.693 --> 09:56.361
What happened to Michael
after the war?

09:56.362 --> 09:59.531
He came back from that
third tour in Afghanistan

09:59.532 --> 10:01.733
two years ago.

10:01.734 --> 10:03.235
He was a changed person.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.571
He had some trouble

10:05.572 --> 10:08.640
with pain pills,
and then drinking.

10:08.641 --> 10:10.943
He was in and out
of therapy for

10:10.944 --> 10:13.111
post-traumatic stress.

10:14.981 --> 10:17.349
When's the last time
you saw him?

10:17.350 --> 10:19.985
Three months ago.

10:19.986 --> 10:22.688
I drove him up to
rehab in Vermont.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.990
He signed himself out
after two days.

10:26.192 --> 10:29.061
It was kinda like
a last straw for me.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.482
He left me these
when he moved out.

10:33.483 --> 10:35.067
His medals.

10:40.406 --> 10:42.207
Couple Bronze Stars,

10:42.208 --> 10:43.742
a Purple Heart.

10:43.743 --> 10:45.277
Hell of a Marine.

10:45.278 --> 10:49.081
The only one he kept
was the Silver Star.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.116
Michael had a Silver Star?

10:51.117 --> 10:53.185
For bravery in combat.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.020
He never let it
out of his sight.

10:55.021 --> 10:58.006
He didn't have a Silver Star
with him when we found him.

10:58.007 --> 11:00.659
He never would have
let that go.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.295
He had a dog tag, though.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.597
Another Marine--
a James Phelps.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.566
Do you know
who that was?

11:07.567 --> 11:09.201
Michael's best friend.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.470
They grew up together,

11:11.471 --> 11:14.439
enlisted together,
fought together.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.843
James didn't make it home?

11:23.316 --> 11:25.517
I hope you're going to find out

11:25.518 --> 11:28.687
who did this and make
them pay for what they did.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.759
Semper Fi.

11:37.797 --> 11:40.766
D.C.P.I.'s not scheduled
to be back from vacation

11:40.767 --> 11:41.767
until next Thursday.

11:41.768 --> 11:43.101
But he offered
to return sooner

11:43.102 --> 11:45.237
if this story blows up.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.938
No, he's earned
his time off.

11:46.939 --> 11:50.542
I'll handle the press
till he gets back.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.445
I'll need five minutes
without interruption.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.614
Yes, sir.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.406
Hey, Dad.

12:04.407 --> 12:05.524
Hey, got a minute?

12:05.525 --> 12:07.292
Yeah, for the police
commissioner, of course.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.544
For your father
and a fellow Marine.

12:09.545 --> 12:12.464
Okay.

12:12.465 --> 12:15.267
I pulled Oates' citation
for his Silver Star.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.569
He was wounded
and under heavy fire,

12:17.570 --> 12:20.038
but he saved six
of his men.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.742
And one didn't come home.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.243
Yeah, he's, uh...

12:25.244 --> 12:27.479
He was a hell of a Marine, Dad.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.848
How you doing?

12:29.849 --> 12:31.516
Well, I'm good.
I'm just working the case.

12:31.517 --> 12:35.721
I just thought knowing what
happened to him over there

12:35.722 --> 12:37.089
might get to you.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.124
I'm just trying to find
the killer, Dad.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.126
Just keep your head
and build your case.

12:41.127 --> 12:43.095
What are you saying
to me, Dad?

12:43.096 --> 12:45.530
You worried that I'm
too pissed-off to work the case?

12:45.531 --> 12:48.233
Is that it? 'Cause honestly,
and with all due respect,

12:48.234 --> 12:50.001
if it was me that was
the victim, I'd want

12:50.002 --> 12:51.770
the most royally pissed-off
detective in the world

12:51.771 --> 12:53.438
trying to figure out
who did it to me.

12:53.439 --> 12:57.676
Danny, when a cop catches
a case like this,

12:57.677 --> 12:59.478
he eats it and sleeps it.

13:01.247 --> 13:04.249
He can disappear
from his own life.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.785
I got it, Dad.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.520
If you find yourself on your
third beer

13:08.521 --> 13:11.189
with the TV on
and the door closed,

13:11.190 --> 13:16.461
put it down, turn it off
and go find Linda and the kids.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.563
Yeah.

13:18.564 --> 13:20.565
Appreciate it.

13:21.284 --> 13:25.137
Hey, Reagan, come here.

13:25.138 --> 13:29.007
Look, I've been going through the
video from around the crime scene area.

13:29.008 --> 13:30.409
This is from a security camera

13:30.410 --> 13:32.577
two blocks away from the alley. Huh.

13:32.578 --> 13:34.679
It's 3:15. It's right
in our time frame.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.948
Whoa, hold that. Can you
zoom in on him?

13:36.949 --> 13:38.550
Mm-hmm.

13:39.452 --> 13:40.519
I'm gonna bet

13:40.520 --> 13:42.454
that's blood
on his coat.

13:43.990 --> 13:47.509
All right. Here we go.

13:47.510 --> 13:49.694
Hot off the presses.
Yeah.

13:49.695 --> 13:52.681
My brother's really
pushing hard on this case.

13:52.682 --> 13:54.733
Hey, the victim
was a Marine.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.935
They never leave each
other behind. Yeah.

13:56.936 --> 13:59.471
I know Danny spent some time
overseas with the Corps.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.506
He never talks about it.

14:01.507 --> 14:05.660
Guys who saw combat
usually don't, in my experience.

14:07.497 --> 14:09.414
My grandfather made it back
from Korea,

14:09.415 --> 14:12.684
my dad from Vietnam
and Danny from Iraq.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.586
My junior year,
I went to Europe.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.254
I think it was
the first time

14:16.255 --> 14:18.790
a man in my family left America
without a rifle in his hands.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.042
A regular diplomat.

14:24.096 --> 14:27.566
Last night? Huge party
for this major developer.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.034
Guys were spending
so fast and hard,

14:29.035 --> 14:30.702
it was like they
were mad at their money.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.071
What was the occasion? You
know the West Gate Towers

14:33.072 --> 14:34.372
over on Tenth?

14:34.373 --> 14:35.941
Yeah, the Cassidy project.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.476
The family built
half the city.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.743
Those are the guys.

14:38.744 --> 14:39.845
It was their topping off.

14:39.846 --> 14:42.214
They had a brief program,

14:42.215 --> 14:44.015
and then it was pretty
much a bacchanal.

14:44.016 --> 14:45.851
The place was rocking
till we closed at 3:00.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.886
You guys got a security camera
out back in the alley?

14:47.887 --> 14:49.721
Are you kidding? No.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.289
The only cameras
they're paying for

14:51.290 --> 14:53.258
around here are pointed
at the cash registers.

14:53.259 --> 14:55.293
All right, how
about this guy?

14:55.294 --> 14:58.063
Do you recognize him
from last night?

14:58.064 --> 14:59.431
Uh, yeah.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.416
Yeah, he's some
sort of P.R. guy

15:01.417 --> 15:02.667
for the Cassidy Group.

15:02.668 --> 15:04.769
He gave a speech.
It was pretty funny stuff.

15:04.770 --> 15:06.571
This comedian, he have a name?

15:10.176 --> 15:13.812
This is the program
for the event.

15:13.813 --> 15:15.013
That's him.

15:15.014 --> 15:16.765
"Ian Seroy--

15:16.766 --> 15:19.651
VP for Communications
at Troy Cassidy Group, USA."

15:23.155 --> 15:26.191
12th floor in the back.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.243
I'm looking for
Ian Seroy.

15:29.278 --> 15:31.029
Hey.

15:31.030 --> 15:33.632
Uh, he didn't make it in today.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.917
Is he sick? No, actually, he just hasn't

15:35.918 --> 15:37.035
shown up.

15:37.036 --> 15:38.903
I figured he must
be sleeping it off.

15:38.904 --> 15:39.971
Is he that kind of guy?

15:39.972 --> 15:42.741
Look, you have an address
for this guy?

15:42.742 --> 15:44.476
Sure.

15:48.631 --> 15:50.815
What happened
to your hand?

15:50.816 --> 15:53.818
I work on construction sites.
You always get dinged.

15:53.819 --> 15:56.187
I worked as a mason
tender as a kid.

15:56.188 --> 15:57.689
I never saw a white hat
lift a finger,

15:57.690 --> 15:59.157
never mind get
dinged on a site.

15:59.158 --> 16:00.759
I'm a hands-on guy.

16:00.760 --> 16:01.927
I bet you are.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.128
What's your name?

16:03.129 --> 16:05.897
Phelan, Mark Phelan.
I'm the project manager.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.599
Okay, take my card.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.234
If he shows up,
give us a call.

16:09.235 --> 16:11.269
Sure.

16:17.209 --> 16:18.476
Ian Seroy.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.245
We hear you make
great speeches.

16:20.246 --> 16:22.780
Yeah. I'd love to hear
what you got to say now.

16:22.781 --> 16:24.299
You have the right
to remain silent.

16:24.300 --> 16:27.485
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

16:27.486 --> 16:28.786
Great luggage.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.472
You'll put a rush on that
for us, won't you?

16:38.473 --> 16:41.325
Thank you.

16:42.894 --> 16:43.811
So, killer...

16:43.812 --> 16:45.095
Stop that.
Stop what?

16:45.096 --> 16:46.430
Calling me killer.

16:46.431 --> 16:47.631
What's your dress size?

16:47.632 --> 16:48.999
My what?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.234
You heard her.
She said

16:50.235 --> 16:51.301
what's your
dress size, killer?

16:51.302 --> 16:52.703
I'm a public relations
professional.

16:52.704 --> 16:55.339
I-- I've got...

16:55.340 --> 16:56.573
You got what?

16:56.574 --> 16:58.308
You got in over
your head, that's what, huh?

16:58.309 --> 16:59.877
Huh?!

17:01.780 --> 17:03.647
Are you crying?

17:03.648 --> 17:05.616
He's crying.
He's crying.

17:05.617 --> 17:06.867
What are you
crying about, huh?

17:06.867 --> 17:08.117
What are you crying about?

17:08.118 --> 17:09.787
You crying about
what you and your two

17:09.788 --> 17:11.021
cowardly friends
did last night, huh?

17:11.021 --> 17:12.990
You beat a man and leave him
to die in an alley,

17:12.991 --> 17:14.023
is that what
you're crying about?

17:14.025 --> 17:16.026
It was the...
it was the drinking.

17:16.027 --> 17:18.494
The whole... Everything just--
it just went...

17:18.496 --> 17:19.429
Went?

17:19.430 --> 17:20.830
It went...
Went, went what?

17:20.832 --> 17:22.766
It went...
It's okay. Just tell us.

17:22.767 --> 17:24.867
It just... It went...

17:24.868 --> 17:26.737
It went so wrong.

17:26.738 --> 17:28.856
I... I was caught
in the scrum,

17:28.857 --> 17:31.859
and people, they were...
they were throwing fists

17:31.860 --> 17:34.578
and insults, and the next
thing you know, the...

17:34.579 --> 17:36.413
A man was dead?

17:38.216 --> 17:40.751
It's okay.

17:40.752 --> 17:42.319
It's okay.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.655
I'm sorry.

17:44.656 --> 17:45.906
We get a little emotional

17:45.907 --> 17:47.324
sometimes,
you know.

17:47.325 --> 17:48.725
You understand?

17:48.726 --> 17:52.896
We know you didn't
do it alone, okay?

17:54.933 --> 17:56.967
It was Mark Phelan.

17:56.968 --> 17:59.203
Right. And...?

17:59.204 --> 18:02.172
And... Cassidy.

18:02.173 --> 18:03.841
Your boss.
My boss.

18:03.842 --> 18:04.908
Yeah.
The boss.

18:04.909 --> 18:06.210
God, everything just--

18:06.211 --> 18:07.978
just went so out of control.

18:07.979 --> 18:09.580
Yeah...
I didn't mean it.

18:09.581 --> 18:11.014
I swear, I didn't mean it.

18:11.015 --> 18:12.516
I'm not that kind of guy. I...

18:12.517 --> 18:15.719
I... I didn't mean
to hurt anyone.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.287
Right.

18:17.288 --> 18:19.823
Those are famous
last words, killer.

18:25.780 --> 18:27.531
Hey, Phil.

18:27.532 --> 18:29.700
Getting awful tough
on the Knicks.

18:41.045 --> 18:42.963
Drink, Commissioner?

18:42.964 --> 18:45.465
Love one, Ray,
but if I did,

18:45.466 --> 18:47.451
I'd have to read about
being a candidate

18:47.452 --> 18:49.653
for Betty Ford
in your next column,

18:49.654 --> 18:52.422
so no.
I had impeccable sources.

18:52.423 --> 18:54.191
Really? Who?

18:54.192 --> 18:56.894
With all due respect, no.

18:56.895 --> 18:59.429
You could have called me.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.632
You could have
called my D.C.P.I.

19:01.633 --> 19:04.501
Well, there's nothing
to deny or rebut, Frank.

19:04.502 --> 19:06.737
It's just a kind
of think piece.

19:06.738 --> 19:08.789
That's what you call it.

19:08.790 --> 19:10.540
Humor me here, Ray.

19:10.541 --> 19:13.644
I will give you a description
of your source,

19:13.645 --> 19:15.679
and you nod if I'm right.

19:15.680 --> 19:18.148
Aw, come on, Frank.
You know I can't do that.

19:18.149 --> 19:24.021
What I know is, you need access
to my office a whole lot more

19:24.022 --> 19:26.924
than anyone else's.
What I know is, "Headless Body

19:26.925 --> 19:29.993
in Topless Bar" is a lot more
your bread and butter

19:29.994 --> 19:32.562
than "Mayor Promises
Prompt Snow Removal."

19:32.563 --> 19:34.898
You can't 86 me, Commissioner.

19:34.899 --> 19:36.300
No, I can't.

19:36.301 --> 19:40.103
But Ray, isn't it
really all about

19:40.104 --> 19:42.539
how promptly your
phone calls

19:42.540 --> 19:43.974
are returned?

19:43.975 --> 19:47.311
Around 40,

19:47.312 --> 19:49.313
new in town, easy on the eyes?

19:49.314 --> 19:52.049
What do you need me for?

19:52.050 --> 19:57.287
Well, unlike some, I like to
make sure my sources are solid

19:57.288 --> 19:59.690
and my facts are correct
before I commit.

19:59.691 --> 20:01.124
Now you're pushing.

20:01.125 --> 20:03.727
Office in the Hall.

20:12.203 --> 20:15.522
When I hired you, you
told me that you were intelligent.

20:15.523 --> 20:17.441
Well, you lied, dumbass.

20:17.442 --> 20:18.508
Troy Cassidy.

20:18.509 --> 20:19.526
Yeah, that's me.

20:19.527 --> 20:20.777
Just hang on a second.

20:20.778 --> 20:21.845
Call the guy back

20:21.846 --> 20:23.397
and get him to
do this again.

20:23.398 --> 20:24.865
Because this is crap!

20:24.866 --> 20:26.650
I mean...

20:26.651 --> 20:28.235
And if he doesn't like it,

20:28.236 --> 20:29.853
then he's finished
and so are you.

20:29.854 --> 20:32.406
I said, "Troy Cassidy"!

20:35.326 --> 20:37.294
Excuse me. I thought you guys
were from the carpenters' union.

20:37.295 --> 20:38.745
You know, you're not
half as funny

20:38.746 --> 20:40.797
as you think you are, big shot.

20:40.798 --> 20:42.366
In fact, you're under
arrest for homicide.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.001
That's ridiculous.

20:44.002 --> 20:45.335
I haven't done
a damn thing.

20:45.336 --> 20:47.254
You know, they say when
something bad happens to you,

20:47.255 --> 20:49.222
the first reaction is denial.

20:49.223 --> 20:51.508
Something real bad's
happening to you.

20:51.509 --> 20:53.110
You got caught.

20:53.111 --> 20:55.562
So your instincts are
right on the money.

20:55.563 --> 20:57.981
Let's go.

20:57.982 --> 21:00.150
Call the lawyer.
Let's go!

21:09.727 --> 21:11.795
So I had the pleasure
of meeting Larry and Curly.

21:11.796 --> 21:14.998
Now I get to talk
to Moe.

21:14.999 --> 21:18.702
Understand you left the club
with the other two Stooges.

21:18.703 --> 21:20.103
I left by myself.

21:20.104 --> 21:22.606
Really? What time was that?

21:22.607 --> 21:23.940
I don't wear a watch.

21:23.941 --> 21:25.208
Around 3:00.

21:25.209 --> 21:29.646
3:00. Right around the time
a man happened to be killed

21:29.647 --> 21:30.881
outside the club

21:30.882 --> 21:32.916
where you were throwing
yourself a little party, huh?

21:32.917 --> 21:34.317
It's a violent city.

21:34.318 --> 21:35.852
And you're a violent man.

21:35.853 --> 21:37.854
So we got a problem.

21:37.855 --> 21:42.993
Your pal Ian Sorey says you
and Mark Phelan killed that man.

21:42.994 --> 21:44.428
Right in an alley

21:44.429 --> 21:45.796
behind the club.

21:45.797 --> 21:46.830
That's nonsense.

21:46.831 --> 21:47.898
Is it?

21:47.899 --> 21:49.166
Besides, Sorey's a putz.

21:49.167 --> 21:51.001
And he'd tell you anything
you want to hear.

21:51.002 --> 21:52.502
But Phelan-- I'd believe it.

21:52.503 --> 21:54.137
Think he has
a record.

21:54.138 --> 21:56.273
I think he's even
been to jail.

21:56.274 --> 21:58.341
And yet you hired him.
My father did.

21:58.342 --> 22:02.012
He believed in second chances,
but I think the guy's shady.

22:02.013 --> 22:04.214
Now, is that just
a coincidence

22:04.215 --> 22:07.384
that he takes off the minute
you guys walk off the job site

22:07.385 --> 22:10.253
this morning when you came
to look for Seroy?

22:10.254 --> 22:11.888
He probably killed that bum.

22:12.790 --> 22:16.293
That bum was a high school
football star

22:16.294 --> 22:18.895
and a class valedictorian,

22:18.896 --> 22:21.698
and he gave up a scholarship
to fight for his country

22:21.699 --> 22:24.334
to protect cowards like you.

22:24.335 --> 22:26.403
He was a Marine.

22:26.404 --> 22:29.506
Sounds like he made a lot
of bad choices in life.

22:29.507 --> 22:32.409
Maybe so.

22:32.410 --> 22:35.645
You know, one day real soon,
you're going to be

22:35.646 --> 22:38.715
a lonely, rich boy
cowering away in punk city,

22:38.716 --> 22:41.818
terrified every day
of your life.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.154
And I'm going to come
pay you a visit.

22:45.156 --> 22:47.691
I'm going to ask you
about the choices you made.

22:49.127 --> 22:51.027
And we'll see what kind
of smart-ass answers

22:51.028 --> 22:52.896
you got for me then, tough guy.

22:54.932 --> 22:57.100
Lawyers are here.

23:00.471 --> 23:02.172
Two lawyers, huh?
Must be nice

23:02.173 --> 23:03.723
having Dad's money
at your beck and call.

23:03.724 --> 23:05.275
You know I make
my own money?

23:05.276 --> 23:06.610
Yeah, and I'm Jay-Z.

23:06.611 --> 23:07.811
This way, tough guy.

23:07.812 --> 23:08.945
You're not going home yet.

23:08.946 --> 23:10.280
Open up.

23:13.784 --> 23:15.051
Get inside.

23:15.052 --> 23:16.453
Keep him cuffed.

23:16.454 --> 23:17.954
You're a real tough guy

23:17.955 --> 23:19.823
with a badge and a
gun, aren't you?

23:19.824 --> 23:22.192
Ah, maybe you'll
find out one day.

23:22.193 --> 23:23.994
You want him?
Go see a judge.

23:23.995 --> 23:25.579
You are in over
your head, Detective.

23:25.580 --> 23:26.913
I'm in over my head?

23:26.914 --> 23:28.198
I didn't kill a Marine.

23:28.199 --> 23:30.750
You don't like
it, sue me!

23:34.505 --> 23:36.606
<i>What are you
talking about here?</i>

23:36.607 --> 23:38.608
Ian Seroy admitted that him
and the other two guys,

23:38.609 --> 23:39.709
they killed Michael Oates,

23:39.710 --> 23:41.278
and it was Cassidy who
was the ringleader.

23:41.279 --> 23:43.980
You know better than I do
that in this state,

23:43.981 --> 23:45.815
uncorroborated codefendant
testimony is not admissible.

23:45.816 --> 23:48.151
Doesn't mean a damn thing.

23:48.152 --> 23:50.086
Can we hold the guy
for a day, at least? Please?

23:50.087 --> 23:52.122
You see those lawyers
trailing behind him?

23:52.123 --> 23:54.424
They are not legal aid attorneys

23:54.425 --> 23:56.493
just fresh off the boat
from Hucklebuck Law School.

23:56.494 --> 23:59.279
Oh, so two fancy suits
with nice haircuts show up

23:59.280 --> 24:00.564
and my sister's backing down?

24:00.565 --> 24:02.732
No, I'm just waiting
for my brother to show up

24:02.733 --> 24:05.304
with some evidence I can
actually use to nail the guy.

24:06.360 --> 24:08.895
Okay. This Phelan guy--

24:08.896 --> 24:11.698
his doorman called, said he
saw him go out the back door

24:11.699 --> 24:12.899
of his apartment building.

24:12.900 --> 24:14.767
Great. Let's go.

24:14.768 --> 24:17.136
I'll put him through the system.

24:17.137 --> 24:19.305
It'll buy you a day.

24:19.306 --> 24:22.208
That's the sister
that I know and love.

24:32.052 --> 24:33.219
Where's he going?

24:37.224 --> 24:38.641
Come on.

24:44.431 --> 24:46.132
Let me see your hands!

24:47.034 --> 24:50.069
I said put your hands
where I can see them!

24:50.070 --> 24:51.671
There ain't a
rat hole on Earth

24:51.672 --> 24:53.139
you can hide
from me, scumbag.

24:53.140 --> 24:54.306
Turn around.

24:54.307 --> 24:56.576
Spread your legs.

24:57.444 --> 24:58.611
I was not running from anything.

24:58.612 --> 24:59.812
Really?

24:59.813 --> 25:01.647
You just wake up one morning
and decide,

25:01.648 --> 25:04.117
"Hey, I'm going to get a one-way
ticket to Johannesburg?"

25:04.118 --> 25:05.451
You know,
your pal Ian Seroy

25:05.452 --> 25:06.986
put you front and
center at the scene

25:06.987 --> 25:08.554
of an assault that
turned into a murder.

25:08.555 --> 25:10.540
We found your blood type
at the scene.

25:10.541 --> 25:12.191
Probably from your little...

25:12.192 --> 25:13.993
battle wound there.

25:13.994 --> 25:16.028
So what are we
going to find?

25:16.029 --> 25:18.047
We going to find that DNA
is a match to you? Huh?

25:18.048 --> 25:20.600
'Cause you can lie
all you want, punk,

25:20.601 --> 25:22.502
but the DNA never lies.

25:25.873 --> 25:27.740
What happened?

25:27.741 --> 25:29.776
Why'd you kill him?

25:32.713 --> 25:34.614
He was harassing us,

25:34.615 --> 25:36.916
begging in our face,
all aggressive.

25:36.917 --> 25:38.618
I told him
to step off.

25:38.619 --> 25:39.886
Mmm. "Step off."

25:39.887 --> 25:41.621
The guy swung at me,

25:41.622 --> 25:43.256
and Seroy started punching him.

25:43.257 --> 25:46.292
The guy was a handful--
like, almost crazy--

25:46.293 --> 25:48.361
so I went
to pull him off.

25:48.362 --> 25:50.563
But he fell to the ground.

25:50.564 --> 25:52.381
Maybe he hit his head.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.134
So it was just you and Seroy?

25:56.170 --> 25:57.904
What about your boss Cassidy?

25:57.905 --> 25:59.038
Cassidy?

26:00.374 --> 26:01.707
I said, what about Cassidy?

26:01.708 --> 26:04.277
Cassidy wasn't even there.

26:18.985 --> 26:20.319
Hey.

26:20.320 --> 26:22.938
We got a DNA match
on Phelan

26:22.939 --> 26:24.807
and nothing on Cassidy.
Look at this.

26:24.808 --> 26:26.558
It's all starting
to make sense now.

26:26.559 --> 26:29.361
Bunch of cell phone calls
between Cassidy and Phelan.

26:29.362 --> 26:31.680
Started right after
we went after Seroy.

26:31.681 --> 26:33.599
Two buddies getting
their stories straight.

26:33.600 --> 26:35.734
Yeah, but we can't prove
anything on these phone calls.

26:35.735 --> 26:36.968
I know.

26:36.969 --> 26:39.738
Why would Phelan lie
for a scumbag like Cassidy?

26:39.739 --> 26:41.206
Hey, if your daddy
gave you $100 million,

26:41.207 --> 26:43.041
you'd probably use it to keep
you out of a prison cell.

26:43.042 --> 26:44.810
Hey, look
at this-- I came up

26:44.811 --> 26:46.111
with five assault
complaints

26:46.112 --> 26:47.813
against Cassidy
over the last decade.

26:47.814 --> 26:49.364
Charges dropped
on every one of them.

26:49.365 --> 26:51.533
What?
Yep.

26:51.534 --> 26:52.851
This vic lost an eye.

26:52.852 --> 26:55.654
This one was in
a medically-induced coma.

26:55.655 --> 26:57.322
Victims refused to testify.

26:57.323 --> 26:59.191
'Cause Cassidy's paying off
his victims.

26:59.192 --> 27:00.626
Yeah. Looks that way to me.

27:00.627 --> 27:02.261
Yeah, and this time,
the victim died,

27:02.262 --> 27:03.662
so he's paying off accomplices.

27:03.663 --> 27:04.930
Right.

27:06.499 --> 27:08.400
That girl.

27:08.401 --> 27:10.035
We got to find this girl, Sissy.

27:10.036 --> 27:12.237
She was in the alley that night.

27:12.238 --> 27:13.438
She probably saw
the whole thing.

27:13.439 --> 27:14.973
And if Cassidy's
paying off Phelan,

27:14.974 --> 27:17.209
it's the only way we're going
to make a case against him.

27:26.085 --> 27:27.553
In your line of work,

27:27.554 --> 27:30.255
I suppose you get used
to uncomfortable silences.

27:30.256 --> 27:33.225
It's like a muscle you develop.

27:34.227 --> 27:37.195
Nifty little job of recycling.

27:37.196 --> 27:39.131
Recycling?
You come to me

27:39.132 --> 27:41.934
with some flattering offers
for magazine profiles.

27:41.935 --> 27:44.169
I decline,
you call Ray Curston

27:44.170 --> 27:46.371
and make it sound
like they were my idea.

27:46.372 --> 27:48.574
I suppose that's one way
to look at it.

27:48.575 --> 27:49.808
You got another way?

27:49.809 --> 27:51.076
Dozens. It's what I do.

27:51.077 --> 27:54.479
I don't want to get into
a spitting contest with you.

27:55.615 --> 27:57.149
The title on my card, Frank...

27:57.150 --> 27:58.483
May I call you Frank?

27:58.484 --> 28:00.819
Apparently, you think you
can call me anything you want.

28:00.820 --> 28:03.655
It reads, "Deputy Press
Secretary, Office of the Mayor""

28:03.656 --> 28:05.991
Does your press secretary
ever go off to the media

28:05.992 --> 28:07.893
with a spin
you didn't personally approve?

28:07.894 --> 28:09.595
Not if he wanted
to keep his job.

28:09.596 --> 28:11.864
I like my job, Frank.

28:11.865 --> 28:13.966
I like the city
it's brought me to.

28:13.967 --> 28:16.535
And I'd like to think you know
that this wasn't my idea.

28:17.804 --> 28:21.440
What I want to know is,
when you pushed back,

28:21.441 --> 28:23.709
when you told him
that slanting me

28:23.710 --> 28:28.480
like that would be stark-naked
not true, what'd he say?

28:30.116 --> 28:32.784
You think too much of me,
Commissioner.

28:32.785 --> 28:35.587
Oh, I don't think we're
in any danger of that.

28:36.723 --> 28:38.357
I owe you one.

28:39.993 --> 28:44.229
Well, as we used to say
when I was a kid...

28:44.230 --> 28:47.165
nice to see ya,
wouldn't want to be ya.

28:56.476 --> 28:57.793
Sissy.

28:57.794 --> 28:59.678
No, no, it's okay.

28:59.679 --> 29:01.580
It's all right. It's
okay. No. Leave me alone.

29:01.581 --> 29:03.615
I knew you'd come back
to honor Michael.

29:03.616 --> 29:05.017
We just want to talk
about Michael, okay?

29:05.018 --> 29:07.753
We just want to find out
what happened to him.

29:07.754 --> 29:09.488
Okay? We just
want to talk.

29:09.489 --> 29:11.790
It's all right. Come on.
You come with us?

29:11.791 --> 29:13.859
You saw all three of them
hit him, right?

29:13.860 --> 29:15.627
Which one did what?

29:15.628 --> 29:17.462
This one was the worst.

29:17.463 --> 29:18.463
Why?

29:18.464 --> 29:20.432
Michael was...

29:20.433 --> 29:21.984
fighting with this one,

29:21.985 --> 29:25.804
and this one hit Michael
in the head with a bat.

29:25.805 --> 29:27.673
And then...

29:27.674 --> 29:30.075
Michael wasn't moving anymore.

29:30.076 --> 29:32.711
A bat? Like a... a baseball bat?

29:32.712 --> 29:34.279
Where... where did
this bat come from?

29:34.280 --> 29:37.049
It was Michael's.
He kept it for protection.

29:37.050 --> 29:38.817
And this guy hit him with it.

29:38.818 --> 29:40.118
What did they do with the bat?

29:40.119 --> 29:41.753
Did they leave it, take it
with them? Can you remember?

29:41.754 --> 29:43.488
Took it, I think.

29:43.489 --> 29:45.257
Okay. Anything else?

29:47.460 --> 29:51.396
When they were running away,
they were all laughing.

30:02.308 --> 30:04.042
Look, I'll get coverage

30:04.043 --> 30:07.045
from the scene
and the surrounding area.

30:07.046 --> 30:08.680
We'll find it.

30:08.681 --> 30:10.782
I know.

30:13.987 --> 30:15.904
I understand.

30:15.905 --> 30:18.090
Thanks.

30:20.693 --> 30:22.411
That was my boss.

30:22.412 --> 30:23.912
Sissy's statement
gives us

30:23.913 --> 30:26.798
another piece of the
puzzle, but we could use

30:26.799 --> 30:28.900
that physical evidence.
I'll find the bat.

30:28.901 --> 30:31.053
All right, well,
hopefully you can find the bat

30:31.054 --> 30:33.038
and there will be
some usable prints.

30:33.039 --> 30:34.423
I'm doing the best
I can here.

30:34.424 --> 30:36.575
Would it be possible to get
just a little bit of love

30:36.576 --> 30:37.843
maybe from your people?
Just one time?

30:37.844 --> 30:41.513
I can put Sissy in a hotel,
get her cleaned up.

30:41.514 --> 30:44.516
I can work with her on how
to give a credible testimony.

30:44.517 --> 30:46.385
But she is still a homeless girl

30:46.386 --> 30:49.054
with a record
of prostitution and drugs.

30:49.055 --> 30:50.455
Come on.

30:50.456 --> 30:52.391
This girl has no reason to lie.

30:52.392 --> 30:54.559
She is going to get destroyed
on the stand.

30:54.560 --> 30:56.828
If Cassidy walks,

30:56.829 --> 30:58.930
you can't try this case again--
double jeopardy.

30:58.931 --> 31:01.166
If you want me to put
Sissy on the stand

31:01.167 --> 31:03.335
and roll the dice with her,
I will do it.

31:03.336 --> 31:06.338
Just make sure you
can handle both outcomes.

31:10.743 --> 31:12.110
I've had convictions
on weaker cases,

31:12.111 --> 31:13.412
but half the time,
it's because

31:13.413 --> 31:16.381
the defendant shows up
with a public defender

31:16.382 --> 31:17.582
that's completely
burnt out.

31:17.583 --> 31:19.518
Well, I like to think
we're in the business

31:19.519 --> 31:21.453
of leveling the playing field
for victims, but...

31:21.454 --> 31:23.555
What burns me
is every one

31:23.556 --> 31:26.058
of Cassidy's lawyers
is a former prosecutor.

31:26.059 --> 31:27.159
Law school's expensive.

31:27.160 --> 31:28.827
You got to pay
for those student loans somehow.

31:28.828 --> 31:29.861
Yeah.

31:29.862 --> 31:31.696
And...

31:31.697 --> 31:33.264
here we have

31:33.265 --> 31:36.284
cheesecake from Junior's.

31:36.285 --> 31:38.136
Wow.
Mmm.

31:38.137 --> 31:39.654
Ooh.

31:39.655 --> 31:41.173
I remember the summer
they opened-- 1950.

31:41.174 --> 31:44.409
I had 16-inch biceps.

31:45.511 --> 31:46.878
The Dodgers were in
a playoff run.

31:46.879 --> 31:49.047
"Mona Lisa" was playing
on the radio.

31:49.048 --> 31:50.515
When does Nicky get back

31:50.516 --> 31:51.750
from her dad's?

31:51.751 --> 31:53.151
Oh, I got to pick her up later.

31:53.152 --> 31:54.786
Wait till she hears
you got her tickets

31:54.787 --> 31:56.004
<i>to American Idiot on Broadway.</i>

31:56.005 --> 31:58.156
No, babe.
You okay?

31:58.157 --> 31:59.724
Yeah.
Barely said anything.

31:59.725 --> 32:01.827
Yeah.
Tough case to shake, honey.

32:01.828 --> 32:04.096
Is it true
that guy was wearing

32:04.097 --> 32:05.831
his best friend's dog tags
when you found him, Danny?

32:05.832 --> 32:08.033
Yeah, he's the guy

32:08.034 --> 32:11.736
that he couldn't save the night
he earned his Silver Star.

32:11.737 --> 32:13.038
What's a Silver Star?

32:13.039 --> 32:15.073
It's one of our
country's highest awards

32:15.074 --> 32:16.308
for bravery in combat.

32:16.309 --> 32:18.543
Like a trophy
for football?

32:18.544 --> 32:20.245
No, Sean.

32:20.246 --> 32:21.713
It's not at all like that.

32:21.714 --> 32:23.648
There are some things
we do in life

32:23.649 --> 32:26.184
that are more important
than the things we do for fun.

32:26.185 --> 32:29.221
Are you gonna catch
the bad guys, Dad?

32:29.222 --> 32:30.789
Yeah.

32:30.790 --> 32:32.357
I'll do my best.

32:32.358 --> 32:34.693
It's kind of like I always
tell you and your brother,

32:34.694 --> 32:36.194
you know--
if you believe in something,

32:36.195 --> 32:38.430
you keep fighting for it,
no matter what.

32:38.431 --> 32:40.432
That's what your grandpa
always taught me.

32:40.433 --> 32:41.833
And Pop taught me.

32:41.834 --> 32:43.235
Down the generations.

32:44.203 --> 32:47.105
I guess that makes
catching the bad guys

32:47.106 --> 32:49.107
the right thing to do, right?

32:49.108 --> 32:50.842
Uh-huh.

32:53.279 --> 32:55.247
Excuse me, Dad.

32:59.519 --> 33:02.821
When you see yourself
in a victim

33:02.822 --> 33:05.824
it really eats away at you.

33:05.825 --> 33:08.894
<i>You've been a million miles away</i>

33:08.895 --> 33:10.729
these past few days.

33:10.730 --> 33:13.031
What's going on?

33:16.903 --> 33:19.070
There was this one night.

33:21.307 --> 33:22.641
I was out on patrol

33:22.642 --> 33:25.877
in Iraq.
I sprained my ankle.

33:28.481 --> 33:30.749
Stepped in a ditch
or something, I don't know.

33:30.750 --> 33:33.318
Hmm.
Anyway, I was fine.

33:33.319 --> 33:36.121
I got back to the fire base,
I iced it up. No problem.

33:36.122 --> 33:38.823
The next day they...

33:38.824 --> 33:41.026
they sent somebody else
out in my place.

33:43.996 --> 33:46.998
Bobby LaRue.

33:46.999 --> 33:49.000
I called him Chuckles, you know?

33:50.736 --> 33:54.039
Like the candy. Like
the candy Gramp likes.

33:55.741 --> 33:58.777
Sweetest hillbilly kid
you ever met.

33:58.778 --> 34:01.513
He was out
about 20 minutes,

34:01.514 --> 34:03.682
you know...

34:06.252 --> 34:09.454
...before a sniper put a
round through his neck.

34:15.795 --> 34:17.963
He was 19.

34:23.202 --> 34:26.638
Stupid kid.

34:29.475 --> 34:31.275
It should've been me.

34:31.277 --> 34:32.877
No.

34:32.878 --> 34:34.813
No.

34:34.813 --> 34:36.748
Some days I look at you,

34:36.748 --> 34:39.918
and I look at my boys...

34:42.121 --> 34:46.291
...and I just think, did that
19-year-old kid have to

34:46.292 --> 34:49.995
give his life so
I could have all this?

35:07.413 --> 35:09.614
Troy Cassidy.

35:11.484 --> 35:13.318
My lawyer says you
can't come near me.

35:13.319 --> 35:15.420
I don't see any
lawyers around.

35:15.421 --> 35:17.005
What do you want?

35:17.006 --> 35:18.957
Thought about what you said.

35:18.958 --> 35:20.825
So I left my gun
and badge behind.

35:20.826 --> 35:22.994
Just stay away from me.

35:23.829 --> 35:25.797
Where you going? Huh?

35:25.798 --> 35:28.099
<i>What do you think you're doing?
What do you think you're doing?</i>

35:28.100 --> 35:30.468
Not so tough now
it's one-on-one, huh?

35:30.469 --> 35:32.003
Who the hell do you
think you are, huh?

35:32.004 --> 35:32.771
Tell you what.

35:34.140 --> 35:35.640
I'm the guy who's gonna
make you pay for your sins

35:35.641 --> 35:37.842
once and for all, punk,
once and for all! Hey!

35:37.843 --> 35:39.444
Take it easy!
Get off me!

35:39.445 --> 35:41.246
Take it easy! Get off me!

35:41.247 --> 35:42.364
You all right? Yeah,
yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

35:42.365 --> 35:43.531
I'm gonna get you.

35:43.532 --> 35:45.617
One way or another,
I'm gonna get you!

35:45.618 --> 35:46.851
Oh! Take it easy.
I'm on the job.

35:46.852 --> 35:48.586
Take care of your guy.
You live here?

35:48.587 --> 35:49.687
Take it easy, man.

35:49.688 --> 35:51.039
Yeah, I own
the building.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.541
You don't want to get
jammed up over this clown.

35:57.360 --> 36:00.461
Getting inside a perp's head
is a good, solid tactic,

36:00.462 --> 36:03.731
but still, you're lucky
those were old-school cops.

36:03.732 --> 36:06.100
All I wanted to do was to
let Cassidy know that he's

36:06.101 --> 36:08.703
not out of reach, and that
he will never be out of reach.

36:08.704 --> 36:11.506
If you can't keep your
emotions in check,

36:11.507 --> 36:13.680
I will sit you down just like
I would anybody else.

36:15.320 --> 36:16.320
I've lost my head.

36:16.345 --> 36:19.714
You know, I saw the smug
look on Cassidy's face,

36:19.715 --> 36:22.150
and just thinking that a guy
like him can get away with

36:22.151 --> 36:23.818
killing a Marine
like Michael Oates?

36:23.819 --> 36:26.220
We all know what he
went through over there.

36:26.221 --> 36:27.956
To think he could
walk through that

36:27.957 --> 36:30.024
hell storm and come
back here and end up dead

36:30.025 --> 36:32.327
like a dog in the streets
of his own city?

36:32.328 --> 36:35.697
Taking Cassidy down will not
bring Michael Oates back,

36:35.698 --> 36:38.199
and it will not give you answers
to what happened in Iraq.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.101
What it will do

36:40.102 --> 36:41.536
is bring a killer
to justice,

36:41.537 --> 36:43.638
and that has to be enough here.

36:45.674 --> 36:47.375
Look...

36:47.376 --> 36:49.777
Cassidy's got money, but he's
not a professional killer.

36:49.778 --> 36:53.081
He made mistakes.

36:53.082 --> 36:55.483
It's up to you to
make him pay for it.

36:57.086 --> 36:58.953
Yes, sir.

37:01.190 --> 37:04.225
That the stuff from the
search of Phelan's loft?

37:04.226 --> 37:05.627
Yeah, Sarge.

37:05.628 --> 37:08.196
Crying shame if a punk like
Cassidy gets away with murder.

37:08.197 --> 37:11.432
Well, we got two choices.
Get Phelan to tell the truth

37:11.433 --> 37:13.735
or come up with some physical
evidence that ties Cassidy

37:13.736 --> 37:16.170
to the scene of the crime...
What is it?

37:16.171 --> 37:18.473
It's a taxi receipt from
the night of the murder.

37:18.474 --> 37:20.541
Times out right around
the time of the killing.

37:20.542 --> 37:22.577
Greedy son of a bitch.

37:22.578 --> 37:24.662
Phelan used a taxi
for a getaway car.

37:24.663 --> 37:26.313
I gotta find this cab driver. All right.

37:26.314 --> 37:27.982
The mayor finishes his remarks

37:27.983 --> 37:29.684
and hands off
to the commissioner.

37:29.685 --> 37:31.285
The commissioner
awards the plaque,

37:31.286 --> 37:32.587
a few softball questions,

37:32.588 --> 37:34.422
and we're out.
If you get any questions

37:34.423 --> 37:36.674
about me running for mayor,
you'll take them.

37:38.527 --> 37:39.894
I will?
And say

37:39.895 --> 37:41.429
it was a misunderstanding
on your part.

37:41.430 --> 37:43.398
That sounds like
an order, Frank.

37:43.399 --> 37:45.833
No, it's just
a friendly request.

37:45.834 --> 37:49.203
I, I can't pretend
to speak for you.

37:49.204 --> 37:51.305
Recent history
suggests otherwise.

37:56.011 --> 37:58.312
Give us a moment.
Certainly.

38:01.884 --> 38:03.918
I'm not sure I'm
following you, here.

38:03.919 --> 38:05.219
Your press office

38:05.220 --> 38:07.822
fed Ray Curston with
an impression of me

38:07.823 --> 38:09.624
that we both know to
be wildly inaccurate.

38:09.625 --> 38:12.026
No, that's just Ray
on a slow news day,

38:12.027 --> 38:13.428
stirring the pot.

38:13.429 --> 38:14.862
That's not what happened.

38:14.863 --> 38:19.467
End of the day, we're both
in the people business, Frank.

38:19.468 --> 38:22.603
Once in a while, you
take one for the team.

38:22.604 --> 38:25.373
I never really thought
of us as a team.

38:25.374 --> 38:27.375
No? Well, the last
time I looked,

38:27.376 --> 38:30.244
they don't hold elections
for sheriff in this town.

38:30.245 --> 38:32.046
It's an appointed position.

38:32.047 --> 38:34.148
It's appointed by me.

38:34.149 --> 38:35.383
I know that.

38:35.384 --> 38:37.885
Okay, so you give a little,
and you get a little.

38:37.886 --> 38:39.253
I gave; what do I get?

38:39.254 --> 38:42.023
You get to be my
police commissioner.

38:48.897 --> 38:50.448
Excuse me.

38:50.449 --> 38:52.750
Hey, your boss said the guy
who usually does the overnights

38:52.751 --> 38:53.901
called in sick on Thursday.

38:53.902 --> 38:55.470
Says you did a double
in his place.

38:55.471 --> 38:57.171
We spoke to

38:57.172 --> 38:59.073
a cab driver that said
he took this man here,

38:59.074 --> 39:00.808
waited for him.
Do you know who this is?

39:00.809 --> 39:03.377
That's the project manager.
Mark Phelan.

39:03.378 --> 39:05.012
He came by at...

39:05.013 --> 39:08.015
3:30. He ran in,
said he'd be a minute.

39:08.016 --> 39:10.785
What'd he do? He went into
the office for a minute.

39:10.786 --> 39:13.121
And when he was leaving,

39:13.122 --> 39:15.606
he tossed a Hefty bag
into the Dumpster.

39:15.607 --> 39:17.809
This Dumpster
right here?

39:19.728 --> 39:21.362
When's the last time
they picked this up?

39:21.363 --> 39:23.531
Every Monday. The guy
should be here any minute.

39:23.532 --> 39:26.400
You find a bat in there?

39:26.401 --> 39:29.704
Not a bat.

39:29.705 --> 39:31.289
Something better.
It's a coat.

39:33.441 --> 39:34.776
And it's covered with blood.

39:37.379 --> 39:38.796
"TKC."

39:38.797 --> 39:41.249
Troy Kennedy Cassidy.

39:42.668 --> 39:44.385
Son of a bitch.

39:44.386 --> 39:46.471
Okay. Let me run this

39:46.472 --> 39:49.157
into the car.

39:49.158 --> 39:50.558
Where's Troy Cassidy right now?

39:50.559 --> 39:51.893
Up on ten.

39:51.894 --> 39:53.644
Up on ten, huh?

39:57.816 --> 39:59.984
Absolutely not. Abso...

40:01.904 --> 40:04.438
Listen. I have to go,
call you back.

40:04.439 --> 40:07.275
What the hell do
you want now?

40:07.276 --> 40:08.676
Look familiar?

40:10.946 --> 40:13.481
You're under arrest for
the murder of Michael Oates.

40:13.482 --> 40:15.683
Now turn around.

40:15.684 --> 40:17.418
Turn around.

40:23.959 --> 40:26.544
I was hoping you'd do
something stupid.

41:02.130 --> 41:04.298
Now how the hell
do you like it, huh?

41:04.299 --> 41:06.634
How's it feel, huh?

41:06.635 --> 41:08.970
You like getting hit
when you're down?

41:13.225 --> 41:14.709
Here, want to see
how he felt?

41:14.710 --> 41:17.879
Huh? Huh?

41:34.563 --> 41:36.530
Reagan?
It's okay.

41:36.531 --> 41:39.033
It's all right.
Just cuff him.

41:39.034 --> 41:41.953
Just cuff him.

41:45.641 --> 41:48.442
Eternal rest grant
unto him, oh, Lord,

41:48.443 --> 41:51.345
and may perpetual light
shine upon him.

41:51.346 --> 41:54.081
May he rest in peace. Amen.

41:54.082 --> 41:57.118
May his soul, and all the souls
of the faithful departed,

41:57.119 --> 42:00.254
through the mercy of
God rest in peace.

42:00.255 --> 42:03.357
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son,

42:03.358 --> 42:05.960
and of the Holy
Spirit, Amen.

42:35.791 --> 42:37.558
If I didn't have
this family,

42:37.559 --> 42:40.628
who's to say
that wouldn't be me?

42:40.629 --> 42:42.830
You do have us, Danny.

42:42.831 --> 42:44.732
Never forget that.
