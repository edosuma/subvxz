00:07.140 --> 00:09.460
POLICE RADIO: 'Attention all units.

00:09.460 --> 00:12.460
'Portland Tower has been declared
a critical incident.

00:12.460 --> 00:13.980
'Two confirmed fatalities.

00:13.980 --> 00:17.460
'One teenage girl.
One police officer.'

00:19.460 --> 00:20.980
What happened, did you hear?

00:20.980 --> 00:22.460
Just what Control was reporting -

00:22.460 --> 00:24.980
there were people on the roof,
then there weren't.

00:24.980 --> 00:27.980
'Control receiving DI Shaw
at Portland Tower.

00:27.980 --> 00:30.460
'We have a death in contact
with police. Where the hell is DSI?'

00:30.460 --> 00:34.460
DSI 14 to Control,
we are arriving on scene.

00:34.460 --> 00:35.460
'Copy.'

00:44.460 --> 00:47.460
There are still people up there.

00:53.460 --> 00:54.460
I'll go to the roof.

01:05.820 --> 01:08.460
Police, step out of the way, please.

01:14.460 --> 01:16.460
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:16.460 --> 01:18.460
This is a crime scene,
you can't come through here.

01:18.460 --> 01:20.460
Detective Sergeant Sarah Collins,

01:20.460 --> 01:22.460
Directorate
of Special Investigations,

01:22.460 --> 01:23.820
we're taking over the scene.

01:23.820 --> 01:27.460
My colleague DC Steve Bradshaw...
I've got it, Sarah. Go.

01:43.460 --> 01:45.460
'Hey.' Steve, get someone
on the lobby door.

01:45.460 --> 01:48.460
Until I know what's happening on the
roof, no-one's to move, up or down.

01:48.460 --> 01:51.460
'OK, we're a bit short-handed...'
Recall to duty the whole team.

01:51.460 --> 01:52.460
'Got it.'

02:25.460 --> 02:27.460
Who the hell are you?

02:27.460 --> 02:32.460
Sarah Collins, sir, DSI.
You radioed for us.

02:32.460 --> 02:34.460
Yeah.

02:36.460 --> 02:37.500
I have to ask
what you're doing up here.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.460
One of my officers is dead,

02:39.460 --> 02:42.300
the other one just saved
this child's life.

02:42.300 --> 02:45.460
I'm here to make sure no-one else
falls off the fucking roof.

02:47.460 --> 02:49.660
It's going to be OK, Lizzie.

02:49.660 --> 02:52.460
We're gonna get you both
down now OK?

02:53.500 --> 02:56.460
Have you traced the boy's family?
Yeah, his mum's on the way.

02:58.460 --> 03:01.140
Control receiving DS Collins, DSI.

03:01.140 --> 03:03.460
I am assuming operational control
at Portland Tower.

03:03.460 --> 03:06.660
Request LAS for adult female,
believed going into shock.

03:06.660 --> 03:10.460
'Copy that, LAS units en route.'
Lizzie.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.460
I'm Sarah Collins.

03:18.460 --> 03:20.460
Paramedics are on their way.

03:44.460 --> 03:47.460
No, no, no. Just wait there.
Sorry.

03:53.460 --> 03:55.460
Ben, Ben, Ben.

03:58.460 --> 04:00.500
Did she do anything to him?
We don't know exactly what happened.

04:00.500 --> 04:03.460
We have a doctor here who can
examine... No, I'm taking him home.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.460
Let me send a Family Liaison Officer
with...

04:05.460 --> 04:08.460
I'm taking him home,
I don't want police or anyone.

04:10.460 --> 04:12.460
I'm afraid
we will need to speak to you.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.140
Please, I just want to go home.

04:28.460 --> 04:30.460
What happened here, Steve?

04:30.460 --> 04:33.460
All I've got so far is the girl
grabbed the boy from his home.

04:33.460 --> 04:36.660
Took him to the top of the tower.
Two cops got the call,

04:36.660 --> 04:39.460
tried to stop her doing
whatever she was going to do.

04:39.460 --> 04:43.140
The result - the girl fell to
her death, so did one of the cops.

04:43.140 --> 04:46.300
OK... Put Jez on CCTV.

04:46.300 --> 04:48.460
You take the door-to-door,
grab any phone footage you can

04:48.460 --> 04:50.980
before it's all over the internet,
plus any BWV footage.

04:50.980 --> 04:53.140
And get the phones of the officers.

04:53.140 --> 04:55.300
Who's our Family Liaison?
Alice Parker?

04:55.300 --> 04:57.460
Ask her to meet me here.
I'll talk to the CSM,

04:57.460 --> 04:59.460
then head to the local nick.
Farlow, isn't it?

04:59.460 --> 05:02.300
Seal lockers, grab a spare office.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.660
We need statements,
especially that female PC.

05:04.660 --> 05:07.460
If she was up there. She saw.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.460
Lizzie?

05:17.460 --> 05:19.460
It is Lizzie, isn't it?

05:20.660 --> 05:23.460
Steve Bradshaw, DSI.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.460
How are you feeling?

05:29.820 --> 05:33.300
Fine. We've just got some checks
to do before you go.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.660
OK.
I'll pop back in a few minutes.

05:53.460 --> 05:56.460
All right?
Guv.

05:56.460 --> 05:59.460
Crime scene guys are gonna need
to take your uniform.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.460
They'll give you something to wear.

06:06.460 --> 06:08.460
I want to go home.

06:10.460 --> 06:12.460
Let's wait and see
what the medics say, OK?

06:12.460 --> 06:14.460
But when they're done.
It's not my call.

06:14.460 --> 06:16.820
DSI are running this case now.

06:16.820 --> 06:18.460
Why?

06:18.460 --> 06:21.460
It's a death in contact with police,
Lizzie.

06:21.460 --> 06:23.460
The girl's dead, Hadley's dead.

06:24.460 --> 06:27.460
DSI run the investigation,
no choice.

06:29.460 --> 06:31.460
I want to go home.

06:35.300 --> 06:36.460
OK.

06:45.460 --> 06:48.460
Sarah.
Sir.

06:48.460 --> 06:50.460
This is a mess.

06:51.460 --> 06:54.460
I'd better feed that lot. Anything
specific you want out there?

06:54.460 --> 06:57.460
Witnesses.
Otherwise, as little as possible.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.500
We're still informing
the families of the deceased.

06:59.500 --> 07:02.460
Police Constable Hadley Matthews,
52.

07:02.460 --> 07:03.460
Farah Mehenni, 15.

07:05.140 --> 07:07.980
Did you know Farah's father, Younes,
is in custody at the local nick?

07:07.980 --> 07:11.460
Some minor charge.
I didn't know. Sorry.

07:11.460 --> 07:13.460
Like I said, a mess.

07:13.460 --> 07:15.980
We'll get a Family Liaison
over there, get him released ASAP.

07:15.980 --> 07:18.140
I'm going to the nick. I'll do it.
Good.

07:19.460 --> 07:20.660
In the meantime, I'll do as you say

07:20.660 --> 07:22.460
and tell the press
absolutely nothing.

07:26.140 --> 07:28.460
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

07:39.460 --> 07:43.460
Do you want me to come in?
Make you a cup of tea?

07:43.460 --> 07:45.460
I don't think you should be alone.

07:45.460 --> 07:47.460
I'm fine, Arif, honestly.

08:18.460 --> 08:21.460
Excuse me, where's your
custody sergeant, please?

08:21.460 --> 08:22.820
He's just over there.
Thank you.

08:28.460 --> 08:31.460
Sarah Collins, DSI. Alice Parker.

08:31.460 --> 08:34.300
You have a Younes Mehenni
in custody.

08:34.300 --> 08:36.460
I'd like to bail him
on compassionate grounds.

08:36.460 --> 08:39.140
We'll be basing our investigation
here at first,

08:39.140 --> 08:42.460
so if someone could show Alice
a spare office, I'd be grateful.

08:42.460 --> 08:44.980
Also, Alice will need to seal
PC Adama and PC Matthews' lockers.

08:44.980 --> 08:46.820
They're part of the investigation.

08:46.820 --> 08:48.460
You've got
a fucking nerve...

08:53.660 --> 08:57.980
I know you've lost a colleague...
a friend.

08:59.460 --> 09:01.460
I'm truly sorry about that.

09:02.460 --> 09:05.460
But it's my job
to find out why he died.

09:05.460 --> 09:07.460
We're not the ghost squad,
we're not here to dig up dirt,

09:07.460 --> 09:09.460
we just want to find out
what happened.

09:09.460 --> 09:12.820
So, please... bear with us.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.460
Help us.

09:15.460 --> 09:17.460
That's very reassuring, thank you,
Sarah.

09:17.460 --> 09:20.140
Jenny, could you help Alice?

09:40.460 --> 09:43.460
Mr Mehenni, I'm Sarah Collins,

09:43.460 --> 09:46.460
from the Directorate
of Special Investigations.

09:46.460 --> 09:50.460
I'm afraid I have terrible news.
Your daughter Farah.

09:50.460 --> 09:53.460
We haven't got all the details yet,
but...

09:54.500 --> 09:56.460
Yes?

09:56.460 --> 09:58.460
I'm afraid she died.

09:58.460 --> 10:00.500
I'm so sorry.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.460
We're releasing you so you can be
with your family, there's a car...

10:03.460 --> 10:06.460
Died? No... No, she's at school.

10:06.460 --> 10:09.500
Mr Mehenni, there are procedures we
have to follow. I don't believe you.

10:13.300 --> 10:14.460
I want to speak to my daughter.

10:32.460 --> 10:33.460
I'm so sorry.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.460
Hadley Matthews is dead, too,
you know.

10:49.460 --> 10:53.460
Have you told his wife and kids yet?
You had a good cry with them?

10:56.460 --> 10:58.460
Can I see the custody sheet?

11:06.460 --> 11:07.460
Thanks.

11:38.460 --> 11:41.460
'Hey, Lizzie. It's Steve Bradshaw,
from the ambulance, remember?

11:41.460 --> 11:44.460
'We need to do a quick debrief,
get your statement.

11:44.460 --> 11:46.460
'I just want to know you're OK.

11:46.460 --> 11:48.460
'My number's on your mobile.'

11:55.460 --> 11:58.140
Steve? You with Lizzie Adama?

11:58.140 --> 12:01.460
No. I just found out she went home,
soon as the medics released her.

12:01.460 --> 12:05.460
Before you could talk to her?
'Afraid so. Police car took her.'

12:05.460 --> 12:08.460
Who the hell authorised that?
Her guvnor, DI Shaw.

12:08.460 --> 12:11.460
'Why'd you ask?' Because we might
have a shit storm here.

12:11.460 --> 12:12.460
Hang on a sec.

12:12.460 --> 12:15.460
Excuse me. Sarah Collins, DSI.
An office has been set up for us?

12:15.460 --> 12:18.460
Oh, yeah, that way,
second door on the right. Thanks.

12:18.460 --> 12:19.460
'Lizzie!'

12:19.460 --> 12:21.460
It's Steve.

12:21.460 --> 12:25.460
So, what's the shit storm, then?

12:25.460 --> 12:27.460
Younes Mehenni,
the dead girl's father,

12:27.460 --> 12:29.980
was in custody at Farlow nick,
and Lizzie Adama...

12:31.460 --> 12:32.460
Oh, for Pete's sake.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.660
What?
'Nothing.'

12:34.660 --> 12:37.460
Lizzie Adama
was Mehenni's arresting officer.

12:37.460 --> 12:40.460
Look, I'm at her place now.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.460
OK. Well, don't let her
out of your sight.

12:50.460 --> 12:54.460
'Lizzie? It's Steve. Lizzie,
can you open the door, please?'

12:57.460 --> 12:59.140
She's not answering the door.

12:59.140 --> 13:00.460
Kick it down.

13:00.460 --> 13:03.140
What?
Just do it, Steve. Get in there.

13:23.140 --> 13:25.140
Lizzie?

13:25.140 --> 13:28.460
Are you OK? It's Steve.

13:41.460 --> 13:43.460
She's gone.

13:53.460 --> 13:54.980
Today was a bad day.

13:56.460 --> 14:00.300
We've all lost someone we loved.
He was the heart of this place.

14:01.460 --> 14:04.300
He looked out for me
when I was a young copper.

14:04.300 --> 14:07.460
Kid from Kintyre,
still very wet behind the ears.

14:07.460 --> 14:09.500
And I know he looked out for
many of you, too.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.980
Cos that's who he was,
that's who we lost.

14:12.980 --> 14:16.460
Now I'm going to have to take
his wife, Mandy, to ID his body.

14:18.300 --> 14:19.460
We may all be grieving in this room,

14:19.460 --> 14:22.460
but her whole world is broken,
her and her kids.

14:22.460 --> 14:26.460
We owe it to her to keep on going,
to keep doing our job.

14:26.460 --> 14:29.460
That's what Hadley would have
wanted, it's what he would've done.

14:29.460 --> 14:32.460
What about DSI, sir?

14:32.460 --> 14:35.460
DSI have a job to Do, too.

14:36.460 --> 14:37.460
You got nothing to hide.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.460
You just answer their questions
and they'll be gone.

14:40.460 --> 14:42.460
On Friday night, we go to the pub.

14:44.460 --> 14:46.460
We remember our friend.

14:46.460 --> 14:49.460
We celebrate him. OK?

14:56.820 --> 15:00.460
I'm sorry, Sarah. This is on me.
It's OK.

15:00.460 --> 15:02.980
Any idea where she's gone?
Not yet.

15:02.980 --> 15:05.460
Her car's still parked
down the street.

15:05.460 --> 15:08.460
Her phone's switched off.
We put a watch on her cards.

15:08.460 --> 15:11.460
What do we know about her?
Six months in, well-liked.

15:11.460 --> 15:13.460
From what I hear,
she and Hadley Matthews,

15:13.460 --> 15:15.460
the copper who died,
they were mates.

15:15.460 --> 15:18.460
God. You talk to her family,
friends?

15:18.460 --> 15:20.500
We called round,
no-one's heard from her.

15:24.460 --> 15:28.460
Graduation day.
Takes you back, doesn't it?

15:28.460 --> 15:30.460
My parents didn't come to mine.

15:30.460 --> 15:32.460
What, disappointed you became a cop?

15:32.460 --> 15:35.500
The disappointment went
a little further back than that.

15:43.460 --> 15:45.460
Hey, Jez.
Could someone have grabbed her?

15:45.460 --> 15:47.460
I don't think so.

15:47.460 --> 15:49.460
Looks like she took toothbrush
and make-up and stuff.

15:49.460 --> 15:53.460
We have to find her -
CCTV, door-to-door, whatever.

15:53.460 --> 15:55.460
Quicker to go public.
Yeah.

15:55.460 --> 15:59.460
I better talk to her guvnor first,
he's the idiot who let her go.

16:20.140 --> 16:23.460
OK, busy Lizzie. I'll tell you
how we're going to do this.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.460
I'm going to set my watch.

16:25.460 --> 16:27.460
Deal with it in ten minutes,
breakfast is on me.

16:27.460 --> 16:29.460
More than ten, and it's on you.

16:29.460 --> 16:32.820
Nah, no, no.
That's hardly fair, is it?

16:32.820 --> 16:36.460
My breakfast is tea and toast,
and yours is a full English,

16:36.460 --> 16:39.460
usually with extra sausages.

16:39.460 --> 16:41.460
Well, yeah, I have to preserve
my lovely figure.

16:44.460 --> 16:47.460
Hey, hey, hey, hey, no, no, no,
not before breakfast.

16:47.460 --> 16:49.300
All right, Mum

16:51.460 --> 16:55.500
Besides... my body type's
ideal for certain things.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.460
Oh, yeah. Like what?

16:58.460 --> 17:00.460
Like, erm...

17:00.460 --> 17:02.460
swimming the Channel?

17:05.460 --> 17:07.460
Disguising beached whales.

17:09.460 --> 17:11.460
Recreating a lunar eclipse.

17:36.460 --> 17:39.460
Meet me at the car in a minute. OK?

17:41.460 --> 17:43.460
If you're here
to talk to Mandy Matthews,

17:43.460 --> 17:45.460
you're out of fucking line.
I'm here to talk to you, sir.

17:45.460 --> 17:47.300
You weren't answering your phone.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.140
Talk to me in the morning,
I'm taking Mandy home.

17:49.140 --> 17:50.660
Lizzie Adama has done a runner.

17:50.660 --> 17:52.460
She's missing.

17:52.460 --> 17:55.460
She didn't talk to my officer
at the scene, she just went home.

17:55.460 --> 17:57.460
I hear you authorised that.

17:58.460 --> 18:01.460
She was upset, for obvious reasons.
She needed a break.

18:01.460 --> 18:04.460
She's police, she knows the drill,
so do you.

18:04.460 --> 18:07.460
Do you know why she ran
or where she might've gone?

18:07.460 --> 18:08.980
No.

18:08.980 --> 18:12.460
We need to find her. I'm gonna go
public, put her face out there.

18:12.460 --> 18:13.460
Do not do that.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.660
Excuse me?
I said don't do that.

18:15.660 --> 18:19.460
Going public would wreck her career,
and that would destroy her.

18:19.460 --> 18:20.500
I'm worried about her,
not her career.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.140
You worried about risking her life?
What do you mean?

18:23.140 --> 18:25.460
She's a significant witness
in a sex trafficking case.

18:25.460 --> 18:28.460
The suspect is missing
and dangerous.

18:28.460 --> 18:30.460
Who's the suspect?
Laszlo Kovacs.

18:30.460 --> 18:33.460
Beat up one of his girls, Cosmina,
fractured her skull.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.460
Lizzie saw Kovacs at the scene.

18:34.460 --> 18:36.460
She makes the case against him
simple.

18:36.460 --> 18:38.460
How does it connect
to Portland Tower?

18:38.460 --> 18:40.460
Kovacs' mobile was activated
near the tower today.

18:40.460 --> 18:42.460
Now that could just be coincidence,

18:42.460 --> 18:45.460
but if I were you, I'd go
check it out. So go check it out.

19:09.460 --> 19:11.460
Is this because of my call?

19:11.460 --> 19:13.460
It is indeed. May we come in?

19:19.460 --> 19:21.460
That's Ben. He thinks he's a bear.

19:23.460 --> 19:26.460
Mrs Stoddard,
will you tell us what...?

19:26.460 --> 19:29.460
Carrie, please.
A cup of tea, coffee?

19:29.460 --> 19:31.460
Cup of tea, very nice, thank you.

19:35.460 --> 19:38.300
You called about
some criminal damage?

19:38.300 --> 19:42.460
It's my neighbour, the Mehennis,
Younes Mehenni.

19:42.460 --> 19:44.500
I have no quarrel with his daughter,
none at all.

19:44.500 --> 19:48.460
The council moved them next door
about two months ago.

19:48.460 --> 19:50.460
I've tried to be friendly,

19:50.460 --> 19:53.460
they're from Libya
and they've been through a lot.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.500
So, what actually happened?
Milk? Sugar?

19:56.500 --> 20:00.500
Milk, please. And sugar.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.460
It started with the rubbish.

20:03.460 --> 20:08.460
First, it was all over the place,
I mean, every day.

20:08.460 --> 20:10.660
I spoke to the housing officer
about it,

20:10.660 --> 20:12.980
but then our bins started
getting knocked over.

20:12.980 --> 20:15.460
Not once - two or three times.

20:15.460 --> 20:19.460
After the rubbish,
there was rudeness in the street,

20:19.460 --> 20:21.460
I mean real anger.

20:21.460 --> 20:26.460
And then the car.
The mirrors, the wipers, dents...

20:26.460 --> 20:30.460
It might seem like nothing to you,
but it's just me and Ben here.

20:33.460 --> 20:36.140
And I'm...

20:36.140 --> 20:39.460
Well, I'm... scared.

20:39.460 --> 20:42.460
I'm afraid if we can't connect
Mr Mehenni to any specific...

20:42.460 --> 20:46.460
But I can. I have it on my phone

20:46.460 --> 20:52.460
It was pure chance,
I was upstairs and I saw...

20:52.460 --> 20:54.460
Well, I'll show you.

21:02.460 --> 21:07.460
Like I said, I'm scared.
I mean, what will he do next?

21:09.460 --> 21:11.460
We'll talk to Mr Mehenni.

21:11.460 --> 21:14.820
You shouldn't be scared.
Not in your own home.

21:27.460 --> 21:30.460
'I told you, I don't want police.'

21:30.460 --> 21:31.460
I don't want to talk to you,

21:31.460 --> 21:34.460
and I absolutely don't want you
talking to my boy.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.500
I do understand.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.500
But I have a legal duty to try
to find out what happened.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.460
Let me tell you what happened.

21:41.460 --> 21:42.820
I asked the police for help

21:42.820 --> 21:45.300
because our life here
was becoming unliveable,

21:45.300 --> 21:46.500
and the next thing I know is that...

21:48.460 --> 21:50.460
That girl kidnaps my little boy

21:50.460 --> 21:53.460
and drags him to the top
of a tower block.

21:53.460 --> 21:57.460
I agree.
It was an appalling thing to do.

21:57.460 --> 22:00.460
But why did she?
Do you have any idea?

22:00.460 --> 22:04.460
Because she was mad.
Her whole family is mad.

22:04.460 --> 22:08.460
I don't care what they've been
through, she nearly killed my son.

22:09.820 --> 22:12.460
You've both had a terrible
experience. I know.

22:12.460 --> 22:15.460
But it would really help us
if we could talk to Ben,

22:15.460 --> 22:18.460
it might even help Ben
process what...

22:20.460 --> 22:22.460
Do you have children?

22:23.460 --> 22:25.300
No.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.140
No.

22:27.140 --> 22:28.460
I didn't think so.

22:31.460 --> 22:33.460
You're not talking to him.

22:56.460 --> 22:58.980
Hello. Is your son in, Younes?

23:00.460 --> 23:02.980
Can we come in, talk to Younes?

23:02.980 --> 23:04.300
Younes? Yes?

23:05.460 --> 23:07.980
Oh. Thank you, that's very kind.

23:10.980 --> 23:13.460
I'll check upstairs.

23:48.460 --> 23:50.300
Speak man through English.

23:50.300 --> 23:52.500
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

24:14.300 --> 24:17.460
'Hello? Can you hear me?
Talk to me at once!'

24:17.460 --> 24:18.460
Give it.

24:19.460 --> 24:20.460
Hello, can I help you?

24:20.460 --> 24:22.980
'What are you doing there?
Do you have a warrant?

24:22.980 --> 24:24.660
'You must have a warrant,
otherwise...'

24:24.660 --> 24:27.460
No, we don't, we don't need
a warrant, all right?

24:27.460 --> 24:29.460
Mrs Mehenni, she invited us in.
'She says you pushed in...'

24:31.980 --> 24:33.460
Starting Body Worn Video!

24:36.460 --> 24:37.460
Keys.

24:47.460 --> 24:49.460
Shit.
Fuck.

24:49.460 --> 24:51.460
Please leave him alone. Please.

24:51.460 --> 24:53.460
Get out the way. Hold her!

25:05.460 --> 25:07.460
What were you thinking?!

25:07.460 --> 25:09.460
Please don't hurt my dad.

25:09.460 --> 25:14.660
What? We're not gonna hurt him...
What's your name?

25:14.660 --> 25:17.460
Farah.

25:17.460 --> 25:18.460
Farah.

25:24.820 --> 25:28.460
I take it you have more questions?
Yes, sir.

25:28.460 --> 25:31.460
Can you tell me why Younes Mehenni
was arrested?

25:31.460 --> 25:33.460
Criminal damage,
threatening phone calls,

25:33.460 --> 25:35.980
all started with a complaint
from his neighbour.

25:35.980 --> 25:37.660
Carrie Stoddard,
I heard you spoke to her.

25:37.660 --> 25:40.460
Didn't she tell you?
She was too upset to tell me much.

25:40.460 --> 25:41.980
Well, that's hardly surprising.

25:41.980 --> 25:44.460
Is that why Farah took the boy,
because her dad had been arrested?

25:44.460 --> 25:46.460
No. Farah took the boy
cos she had a screw loose.

25:46.460 --> 25:48.460
How so?

25:48.460 --> 25:50.460
You have to ask?

25:50.460 --> 25:51.980
She kidnapped a child.

25:51.980 --> 25:54.660
She would've killed him, too, if
Hadley and Lizzie hadn't intervened.

25:54.660 --> 25:56.460
They were bloody heroes.

25:56.460 --> 25:59.460
Lizzie was Mehenni's arresting
officer. Is that significant?

26:00.500 --> 26:03.460
I don't think so.
Someone had to arrest him.

26:05.460 --> 26:07.460
If that's all, I've got to
ring Lizzie Adama's parents

26:07.460 --> 26:10.300
and tell them their daughter
is missing.

26:11.460 --> 26:13.460
I meant what I said.

26:13.460 --> 26:15.460
She's at risk.

26:15.460 --> 26:16.500
I'm worried.

26:41.460 --> 26:43.460
'Control, this is 2023,

26:43.460 --> 26:46.460
'I'm at Portland Tower.'
CONTROL: 'Go ahead, 2023.'

26:46.460 --> 26:50.300
'I can see the children on the roof.

26:50.300 --> 26:54.140
'They're right on the edge,
there's a police officer, too.

26:54.140 --> 26:58.460
'A police officer's joined them.'
'Can you identify the officer?'

26:58.460 --> 27:03.460
'Um... I think it's 1272.'

27:03.460 --> 27:05.460
'1272 receiving Control...'

27:09.460 --> 27:11.460
'1272 receiving Control...'

27:11.460 --> 27:13.460
'There's another police officer
up there.'

27:13.460 --> 27:16.460
'Why isn't he answering?'
'It's 1835.'

27:16.460 --> 27:19.820
'Have the officers got the children
back from the edge?'

27:21.460 --> 27:24.460
'No. They're talking.

27:25.460 --> 27:27.460
'They're...

27:27.460 --> 27:30.460
'Oh. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh...'

27:30.460 --> 27:34.140
'2023, update your situation,
please.' 'They've fallen.

27:34.140 --> 27:36.460
'Oh, my God.'
'2023, confirm, please.'

27:36.460 --> 27:38.820
'Oh, my God.'
'Who has fallen?

27:38.820 --> 27:42.460
'2023, who has fallen?'

27:43.460 --> 27:47.460
No, call it a night, Steve.
Get in here as early as you can.

27:52.660 --> 27:55.460
We lost one of our
best-loved officers, sir.

27:55.460 --> 27:59.980
People are grieving, and DS Collins
arrives like Little Red Riding Hood,

27:59.980 --> 28:01.460
'stomping around,
upsetting everyone.

28:01.460 --> 28:04.460
'I know it's her job, but does she
have to do it at our nick?'

28:04.460 --> 28:06.300
It's like a slap in the face
to every officer.

28:06.300 --> 28:07.660
Once Sarah gets the evidence
she needs,

28:07.660 --> 28:09.460
she'll go back to Victoria House.

28:09.460 --> 28:13.460
What evidence, sir? This is about
as open and shut as it gets.

28:13.460 --> 28:15.460
Farah Mehenni was bat-shit crazy,
she killed Hadley

28:15.460 --> 28:18.460
and it's only by the grace of God
she didn't kill that boy, too.

28:20.460 --> 28:24.460
Kieran, I don't mind you calling
in the middle of the night,

28:24.460 --> 28:27.460
but if you wanna make
a complaint about Sarah,

28:27.460 --> 28:29.460
you talk to your own guv'nor,
not me.

28:29.460 --> 28:32.460
'I don't wanna make a complaint,
sir, I'm just...

28:32.460 --> 28:34.460
'I'm just hoping you'll have
a word with her, is all.

28:34.460 --> 28:36.460
'Because there's another issue...'

28:37.460 --> 28:39.460
..Lizzie Adama.

28:39.460 --> 28:41.460
I hear she's gone missing.

28:41.460 --> 28:44.460
DS Collins is threatening
to go public about her,

28:44.460 --> 28:45.460
and that is a very bad idea.

28:47.460 --> 28:49.460
Do you know who Laszlo Kovacs is,
sir?

28:49.460 --> 28:52.460
'He's an organised crime target.'

28:52.460 --> 28:55.460
'He's a nasty bastard.

28:55.460 --> 28:58.460
'And he's got every reason
to go after Lizzie.'

28:58.460 --> 29:02.460
We cannot risk exposing her.

29:19.460 --> 29:20.460
Hey, you.

29:20.460 --> 29:23.460
'Middle of the night
and Sarah Collins is still awake.'

29:23.460 --> 29:26.460
Everything all right?
'The baby won't sleep.

29:26.460 --> 29:29.300
'I feel like I haven't slept
for weeks.'

29:29.300 --> 29:30.660
Make Peter do some nights.

29:30.660 --> 29:35.460
'He does, he helps out...
but still...

29:36.460 --> 29:40.460
'Are you working?'
Yeah, but I can talk.

29:40.460 --> 29:44.460
'You seeing anyone?'
No.

29:44.460 --> 29:46.820
'Plenty of fish in the sea.'

29:51.460 --> 29:53.460
I liked the one I had.

29:57.460 --> 30:00.820
'Shit. Sarah, sorry, I've got to go.
I'll call you.'

30:02.140 --> 30:03.460
OK.

30:20.500 --> 30:23.460
Carrie Stoddard. Remember her?

30:23.460 --> 30:26.460
Carrie Stoddard's been making calls.
Lots of calls.

30:26.460 --> 30:29.460
She even got through to the
Chief Superintendent in person.

30:29.460 --> 30:32.460
Turns out Younes Mehenni rang her
last night,

30:32.460 --> 30:36.460
told her to back off, or else.
Or else what, guv?

30:38.140 --> 30:39.460
Carrie Stoddard was upset.

30:39.460 --> 30:41.460
Now, the Chief Superintendent
is upset.

30:41.460 --> 30:43.980
Starter for ten, anyone,
the qualities of shit are...?

30:43.980 --> 30:47.460
Oh, guv, ask me, I know that one.
Yes, Hadley. Shit flows downhill.

30:47.460 --> 30:50.140
Correct... So, bearing
that law of physics in mind,

30:50.140 --> 30:53.460
I guess my question is,
why are you still standing here?

30:53.460 --> 30:54.460
Go nick Mehenni.

31:19.980 --> 31:22.300
Oops, sorry.

31:24.460 --> 31:25.660
You been here all night?

31:25.660 --> 31:27.820
I wanted to get
the timelines clear.

31:27.820 --> 31:29.660
Anything on Lizzie Adama?

31:29.660 --> 31:32.460
Took 300 quid from a cash point
in Peckham last night.

31:32.460 --> 31:36.460
No sign of her on public transport,
Jez is checking car hire places.

31:36.460 --> 31:38.460
What about DI Shaw?

31:38.460 --> 31:40.980
He says that Lizzie's a key witness
in an organised crime case.

31:40.980 --> 31:43.460
The suspect's still at large.

31:48.460 --> 31:51.460
That's him, Laszlo Kovacs.

31:51.460 --> 31:55.980
And that's his victim,
one of his girls, Cosmina Baicu.

31:57.460 --> 32:00.820
Shaw thinks he's connected to this?
Apparently Kovacs' phone

32:00.820 --> 32:03.460
puts him at Portland Tower
yesterday afternoon.

32:03.460 --> 32:06.460
So... he was coming after Lizzie?

32:06.460 --> 32:08.500
Shaw says she makes a case
against Kovacs.

32:08.500 --> 32:12.460
Maybe he was coming after her,
maybe that's why she disappeared.

32:12.460 --> 32:14.460
Have a look at the case,
see if he's a factor.

32:14.460 --> 32:17.460
Can you make it a priority?
OK.

32:19.460 --> 32:21.460
So, what've you got there, then?

32:21.460 --> 32:24.460
999 calls,
radio calls from yesterday.

32:24.460 --> 32:26.820
Guess who we never hear from.

32:26.820 --> 32:30.460
The two cops who were
actually on the roof.

32:30.460 --> 32:33.460
They're first on the scene, but
they don't turn on their bodycams,

32:33.460 --> 32:37.460
Lizzie isn't even wearing hers.
They don't put up for the 999 call,

32:37.460 --> 32:39.460
they don't radio in
when they arrive,

32:39.460 --> 32:41.820
and they don't answer
when Control try to reach them.

32:41.820 --> 32:45.460
Nothing. Why?

32:45.460 --> 32:48.460
And there's something even weirder.
Go on.

32:49.460 --> 32:55.460
17:36, Carrie Stoddard calls 999,
her son has gone missing.

32:55.460 --> 32:57.660
17:40, the incident
goes out over the radio.

32:57.660 --> 33:00.460
High risk, missing child,
in a bear suit.

33:00.460 --> 33:02.300
What does Hadley Matthews do?

33:02.300 --> 33:06.460
He's out of station
on an assignment, but at 17:41,

33:06.460 --> 33:09.980
when the only reported incident
is a possible child kidnap,

33:09.980 --> 33:12.460
when no-one's even mentioned
Portland Tower,

33:12.460 --> 33:14.460
he drops his assignment
and drives like the clappers

33:14.460 --> 33:15.660
straight to the tower,

33:15.660 --> 33:19.460
like he knows exactly
where the kidnapper's going. How?

33:20.500 --> 33:23.140
And why the silence?

33:23.140 --> 33:25.460
From both of them.

33:25.460 --> 33:27.460
What were they hiding?

33:28.460 --> 33:31.460
Hey. Thought I'd catch you.

33:31.460 --> 33:34.460
Good to see you, Steve,
are you well? Yes, sir.

33:34.460 --> 33:36.460
Just wanted to let you know,
this morning,

33:36.460 --> 33:39.460
we'll be releasing the names
of the deceased to the press, OK?

33:40.460 --> 33:43.140
Any luck tracking down
the female PC?

33:43.140 --> 33:45.460
Not yet, sir,
and we're worried about her.

33:45.460 --> 33:48.460
Well, if you're asking to go public,
sorry, the answer's no.

33:50.140 --> 33:52.460
Hope you're not
over-complicating this.

33:54.460 --> 33:56.460
Quite a few things
don't add up, sir.

33:56.460 --> 33:58.460
D'you want my take?

33:58.460 --> 34:02.460
A disturbed teenager stole a child,
and only the heroic action

34:02.460 --> 34:06.460
of a 27-year veteran of the force
prevented an even worse tragedy.

34:06.460 --> 34:08.460
Try to wrap things up here
soon as possible.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.460
Get your team
back to Victoria House.

34:10.460 --> 34:12.460
So, what's your next move?

34:13.500 --> 34:17.460
The disturbed teenager's
postmortem.

34:22.460 --> 34:26.980
The deceased is a 15-year-old
female, North African appearance...

34:28.460 --> 34:30.460
On initial examination at the scene,

34:30.460 --> 34:34.460
the injuries appeared consistent
with a fall from a height...

34:42.460 --> 34:45.460
Farah. Hi.

34:46.460 --> 34:48.460
I've got to go.

34:50.820 --> 34:53.460
He's not in.

34:53.460 --> 34:55.460
You can come and look.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.460
Farah, we're not going to go away.

34:57.460 --> 34:59.460
A serious complaint has been made.
By her.

35:00.820 --> 35:03.460
Yes, by her.

35:03.460 --> 35:06.460
And your dad phoning her last night
didn't help, what was he thinking?

35:06.460 --> 35:08.460
She's trying to get us chucked out.

35:08.460 --> 35:11.460
Listen,
it'd be so much better for him

35:11.460 --> 35:13.980
if he comes in and talks to us
of his own free will.

35:13.980 --> 35:15.660
What will you do to him?

35:15.660 --> 35:19.460
If he comes in, if he tells
the truth about what happened,

35:19.460 --> 35:22.460
I can try and sort it.
Maybe just give him a caution.

35:22.460 --> 35:25.460
What's that?
It's like a warning.

35:25.460 --> 35:29.460
If he comes in.
If he tells the truth.

35:31.140 --> 35:33.460
Farah?

35:33.460 --> 35:35.980
If he comes, will you be there?

35:46.660 --> 35:48.460
That's my mobile number.

35:48.460 --> 35:52.460
If he comes in, call me,
I'll make sure I'm there.

36:00.460 --> 36:03.300
The phone number
in the girl's pocket.

36:04.460 --> 36:06.460
It was Lizzie Adama's mobile.

36:07.460 --> 36:09.460
Lizzie gave Farah
her personal number?

36:09.460 --> 36:13.460
Till she changed it two days ago.
What about the other thing? Kovacs.

36:13.460 --> 36:15.460
That phone trace at Portland Tower?

36:15.460 --> 36:17.460
Wasn't Kovacs, it was
an associate of his, low grade.

36:17.460 --> 36:21.460
Kovacs could've been using his cell.
So could his granny.

36:21.460 --> 36:23.460
Yeah, he's a nasty shit,

36:23.460 --> 36:26.300
but the organised crime guys doubt
he's even in the country.

36:26.300 --> 36:28.460
I think Shaw sent you down
a rabbit hole.

36:28.460 --> 36:31.460
Well, why would he wanna do that?
Is he trying to...?

36:33.460 --> 36:37.460
Farah's phone.
Wasn't in her bag or her pockets.

36:37.460 --> 36:39.500
Where is it?
It wasn't on the inventory

36:39.500 --> 36:41.460
of her stuff from home or school.

36:41.460 --> 36:42.980
Well, then we should
search them again.

36:42.980 --> 36:44.460
What about Lizzie
and Hadley's lockers?

36:44.460 --> 36:49.460
We haven't searched them yet.
What? That's an obvious priority.

36:49.460 --> 36:51.460
I was, but you sent me after Kovacs.

36:51.460 --> 36:55.460
No, Shaw sent us after Kovacs,
like he wanted us to waste time.

36:55.460 --> 36:57.460
We have to search
those bloody lockers.

37:08.570 --> 37:10.210
Hey, busy Lizzie.

37:12.210 --> 37:13.210
It's them all right.

37:14.210 --> 37:15.210
'We're en route.
Do you want to join us?'

37:15.810 --> 37:17.810
You bet your arse I do.
Where's your RVP?

37:17.810 --> 37:19.810
'Hold on a sec.'

37:21.810 --> 37:24.170
'Passing your nick in two minutes.
We can pick you up.'

37:24.170 --> 37:26.810
Fantastic. I'll be in the yard.

37:28.810 --> 37:32.810
Sorry about that.
It's about Younes Mehenni.

37:32.810 --> 37:35.810
Yeah, Guv, er, we went round, but we
haven't been able to nick him yet.

37:35.810 --> 37:37.810
It's not about that.

37:37.810 --> 37:40.810
Apparently, Younes Mehenni's
solicitor is making a complaint.

37:40.810 --> 37:41.810
What about?

37:41.810 --> 37:44.810
Don't have all the details yet,
but he claims an illegal entry

37:44.810 --> 37:46.810
and that Hadley said something
to the girl.

37:46.810 --> 37:49.810
You were with Hadley all the time,
right? Not all the time.

37:49.810 --> 37:51.850
Was your body cam recording?

37:51.850 --> 37:55.810
Not till Mehenni showed up.
Is there a problem here, Guv?

37:55.810 --> 37:58.810
No. No. No problem. It's fine.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.810
We'll sort it...

38:00.810 --> 38:03.810
I've got a lot of confidence in you,
Lizzie, you know that?

38:05.810 --> 38:07.810
Hey.
Want to come on this call?

38:07.810 --> 38:09.810
Go after a couple of real bad guys?

38:09.810 --> 38:11.810
I'd love to, but I...

38:11.810 --> 38:12.850
OK.

38:12.850 --> 38:15.650
I'll see you
at Sergeant Tomo's leaving do.

38:15.650 --> 38:17.810
You're coming?
Oh, yeah.

38:17.810 --> 38:18.850
Be there!

38:18.850 --> 38:20.810
I'm counting on it.

38:20.810 --> 38:22.010
See ya.

38:27.170 --> 38:29.810
Hello?
'Hello. PC Adama?

38:29.810 --> 38:31.810
'This is Farah Mehenni.'

38:31.810 --> 38:34.810
I have spoken to my dad.
He's agreed to come in.

38:34.810 --> 38:36.810
So, are you there?

38:36.810 --> 38:38.810
Erm, when?

38:38.810 --> 38:41.810
Now. We're... We're down the street.

38:41.810 --> 38:44.490
OK, yes. I'm here.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.490
Just you, not the big policeman.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.810
'Remember,
you promised you'd sort it.'

38:48.810 --> 38:51.810
Farah, I didn't promise...
'We're coming now.'

39:15.810 --> 39:17.810
Nothing. No phone.

39:17.810 --> 39:20.810
Nothing in Hadley's locker either.
We better give the key back.

39:21.810 --> 39:23.810
Let me have it.

39:23.810 --> 39:25.810
Got an idea.

39:28.810 --> 39:30.810
Stay here, look busy.

39:31.850 --> 39:33.810
Hey, Debs, isn't it?

39:33.810 --> 39:36.810
Hey, master key for the lockers.

39:36.810 --> 39:41.170
Gotta sign it back in or DS Collins
will kill me. She's a stickler.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.810
What's going on there, then?

39:43.810 --> 39:46.650
Sergeant Tomo's leaving do.

39:46.650 --> 39:47.810
Leaving?

39:47.810 --> 39:50.810
Why's he still here, then?

39:50.810 --> 39:53.010
Still got another week, poor bugger.

39:53.010 --> 39:55.810
Thanks, Debs.

39:55.810 --> 39:56.810
OK.

39:58.490 --> 39:59.810
DI Shaw notified Control

39:59.810 --> 40:02.170
he was putting up for the 999 call
at the tower, didn't he?

40:02.170 --> 40:03.810
What time?
17:52.

40:03.810 --> 40:07.810
Seven minutes before that, he signed
out the master key to the lockers.

40:07.810 --> 40:09.810
You're joking?

40:09.810 --> 40:11.810
A child's been kidnapped,

40:11.810 --> 40:13.850
people have been spotted
on top of Portland Tower,

40:13.850 --> 40:16.850
a major incident
right on his doorstep,

40:16.850 --> 40:20.170
and DI Shaw rushes off to search
Lizzie and Hadley's lockers?

40:21.810 --> 40:22.810
Come with me.

40:27.810 --> 40:30.810
You want to put Detective Inspector
Shaw under directed surveillance?

40:30.810 --> 40:33.810
We have evidence he's interfering
in our investigation.

40:33.810 --> 40:35.810
What evidence?

40:35.810 --> 40:38.010
He sent PC Adama home
from Portland Tower

40:38.010 --> 40:39.810
before we could take a statement.

40:39.810 --> 40:42.810
He wasted our time making us
follow the Laszlo Kovacs angle.

40:42.810 --> 40:46.810
And we have just learned that right
in the middle of the tower incident,

40:46.810 --> 40:49.810
he went and searched PC Matthews
and PC Adama's lockers.

40:49.810 --> 40:51.810
I'd hardly call alerting you
to a threat against PC Adama

40:51.810 --> 40:54.490
"wasting your time".
I spoke to Organised Crime, sir,

40:54.490 --> 40:56.810
they don't believe the threat
is imminent. Second.

40:56.810 --> 40:58.810
If I'm gonna request RIPA authority

40:58.810 --> 41:01.010
to put a highly-thought-of officer
under surveillance,

41:01.010 --> 41:03.810
I'm gonna need better than him
borrowing a locker key.

41:03.810 --> 41:07.490
Sir, DI Shaw is clearly
obstructing this investigation.

41:07.490 --> 41:09.810
I must be able to...
Could you give us a minute, Steve?

41:17.810 --> 41:18.850
You look tired, Sarah.

41:18.850 --> 41:20.810
I'm fine.

41:21.810 --> 41:23.810
Is everything all right
on the home front?

41:25.330 --> 41:27.490
Everything's fine.

41:27.490 --> 41:28.810
Your ex.

41:28.810 --> 41:30.810
I hear she's had a baby.

41:30.810 --> 41:34.810
That's right. His name's Matthew.

41:36.810 --> 41:39.810
I-I can't imagine, but...

41:39.810 --> 41:41.810
I think that'd be difficult.

41:42.810 --> 41:44.330
You two were together a long time.

41:45.810 --> 41:46.810
I'm not sure I understand
your point.

41:46.810 --> 41:49.810
You're under emotional stress
and it's affecting your judgement.

41:49.810 --> 41:51.810
My judgement's fine, thanks.

41:51.810 --> 41:55.490
My concern is that
this investigation

41:55.490 --> 41:58.810
is been manipulated to a conclusion
already being pushed by the press,

41:58.810 --> 42:00.810
and, may I say, by you, sir.

42:00.810 --> 42:03.810
That this whole thing is the fault
of a deranged teenager.

42:03.810 --> 42:05.850
That is not how any investigation
should be run. So, on the record,

42:05.850 --> 42:10.010
I repeat my request for directed
surveillance on DI Shaw.

42:10.010 --> 42:14.170
Do you ever wonder why you're still
a DS, Sarah, at your age?

42:14.170 --> 42:17.650
Because I can't tell jokes to blokes
in bars?

42:17.650 --> 42:18.810
Excuse me, sir...

42:18.810 --> 42:20.810
Jez just called.
Lizzie Adama did rent a car.

42:20.810 --> 42:23.810
Jez found the place,
he tracked the car on ANPR.

42:23.810 --> 42:25.810
It's sitting on a seafront
in St Leonards.

42:25.810 --> 42:27.810
Well, aren't you lucky, Sarah?

42:28.810 --> 42:30.810
You better get down there
and grab her.

42:32.810 --> 42:34.810
Sarah.

42:34.810 --> 42:35.810
I meant it.

42:35.810 --> 42:37.810
Lucky.

42:42.490 --> 42:44.810
It is still unclear

42:44.810 --> 42:47.490
why Farah Mehenni took the boy
from his home.

42:47.490 --> 42:49.810
But neighbours say
that the Mehenni family,

42:49.810 --> 42:51.810
recent arrivals in the UK,

42:51.810 --> 42:53.810
had difficulties
settling into the community

42:53.810 --> 42:56.810
and that police have been called
several times

42:56.810 --> 42:59.170
in response to complaints
of anti-social...

43:05.810 --> 43:07.010
Yes, sir?

43:07.010 --> 43:10.810
Portland Tower. Is there anything
you're not telling me?

43:10.810 --> 43:12.810
No, sir.
'So if DS Collins informs me

43:12.810 --> 43:13.810
'that during the tower incident,

43:13.810 --> 43:16.810
'you searched Hadley Matthews
and Lizzie Adama's lockers,'

43:16.810 --> 43:18.810
is she lying?

43:20.810 --> 43:22.810
No, she's not lying.
I searched them.

43:22.810 --> 43:24.010
'Why?'
Why?

43:24.010 --> 43:26.810
Yes, why, for Christ's sake?

43:26.810 --> 43:29.810
I searched the lockers cos who knows
what cops keep in them. That's why!

43:29.810 --> 43:32.810
'What if Hadley had
betting slips or porn?

43:32.810 --> 43:35.010
'The story stops becoming about
the cop who saved a boy's life'

43:35.010 --> 43:37.810
and starts becoming
about a creepy sex addict.

43:37.810 --> 43:39.810
That's why I searched their lockers.
Look, I'm sorry,

43:39.810 --> 43:41.810
but if DS Collins wants
to come after me for that,

43:41.810 --> 43:43.850
then fine, she can have at it.

43:43.850 --> 43:45.810
'And did you find anything?'

43:47.810 --> 43:50.490
No, not a thing.
'Good.'

43:50.490 --> 43:54.810
DSI have tracked down Lizzie Adama,
they should bring her in soon.

43:56.810 --> 43:58.810
Where is she? Is she OK?

43:58.810 --> 43:59.810
Let DSI handle it, Kieran.

44:02.810 --> 44:04.330
'Good night.'

44:04.330 --> 44:07.810
Lizzie Adama. She's that pretty
young officer, isn't she?

44:09.810 --> 44:11.810
Yeah.

45:05.810 --> 45:06.810
Hello, Lizzie.

45:08.810 --> 45:10.810
Are you heading to your car?

45:10.810 --> 45:13.810
That's how we found you.
Car rental.

45:13.810 --> 45:15.650
We just want to talk to you.

45:22.810 --> 45:24.650
Lizzie...

45:35.810 --> 45:36.810
Watch out, Steve!

45:46.010 --> 45:48.810
I think we're done protecting
Lizzie Adama, don't you?

45:48.810 --> 45:50.330
You want to go public?

45:50.330 --> 45:52.850
I want her face
on every TV in the country.
