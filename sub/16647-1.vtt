"$500 for the death of Charlie Wei."

01:13.447 --> 01:15.614
Hey, friend. Not bad style.

01:17.326 --> 01:19.327
You should take it easy. You look done in.

01:22.126 --> 01:24.726
Guess you must be
the four-door fist champion.

01:26.125 --> 01:27.259
Charlie Wei?

01:28.445 --> 01:30.945
I'm Charlie Wei.
Your name, if you have one.

01:32.205 --> 01:33.405
Sure, it's Thunderleg.

01:36.725 --> 01:38.792
I've heard of his devil's kick.
Of course, yeah.

01:39.284 --> 01:40.884
Everyone knows in the kung fu world.

01:41.284 --> 01:43.218
It's a method that's
never been defeated yet.

01:44.804 --> 01:46.071
And won't be.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.357
I suppose I should warn you:

01:49.924 --> 01:52.091
I've been given good money to kill you.

01:53.043 --> 01:55.677
What the hell are you talking about?
Someone's paid you to kill me?

01:56.282 --> 01:58.349
I'll give you twice as much to kill him!

01:59.442 --> 02:01.809
You could, only my honour comes first.

02:02.843 --> 02:05.710
You must realize I'm paid to kill.
The contract's sealed.

02:06.362 --> 02:08.162
- So you must die.
- Don't be so sure of that...

02:08.601 --> 02:10.735
...for Charlie Wei,
champion of the four-door fist...

02:11.241 --> 02:12.841
...has never yet been defeated.

02:13.961 --> 02:16.028
I'll break every bone in your body...

02:16.681 --> 02:17.981
...and send you to hell.

03:38.033 --> 03:39.300
Professor?

03:42.032 --> 03:43.966
- What is it, master?
- You'll finish the lesson.

03:44.512 --> 03:46.813
- I have something to attend to.
- Yes, sir. I will, sir.

03:54.312 --> 03:55.179
Stop!

03:57.551 --> 03:59.051
I'm now going to demonstrate.

04:00.151 --> 04:02.251
The first lesson I will instruct you in...

04:02.751 --> 04:04.418
...is the 5 animal styles.
- He's gone bonkers.

04:04.830 --> 04:06.564
- Three-legged cat.
- Four-eyed rat.

04:07.591 --> 04:08.724
Let's get started.

04:10.230 --> 04:11.563
Dragon sees tiger.

04:12.990 --> 04:15.457
Tiger tears. Snake's tongue darts out.

04:17.149 --> 04:20.249
Panther sees fire.
White crane spreads wings.

04:21.909 --> 04:23.643
No, hold it, hold it.

04:26.749 --> 04:29.816
There isn't any power in your wrist.
How do you expect to make progress?

04:30.629 --> 04:31.495
Well?

04:48.026 --> 04:49.393
Straighten it up.

05:06.625 --> 05:09.425
I suppose you think that was real funny,
pulling tricks on your teacher.

05:10.064 --> 05:12.231
We'll see. Take that! And that!

05:12.744 --> 05:15.144
- It wasn't me!
- Who was it? Tell me.

05:16.103 --> 05:17.037
Who was it?

05:17.303 --> 05:18.337
Freddie did it.

05:24.583 --> 05:25.983
So, Freddie Wong.

05:26.983 --> 05:29.250
Now, just because your father is
Master Wong...

05:29.782 --> 05:32.183
...gives you no damn right
to cause any trouble here.

05:32.742 --> 05:35.243
Oh, balls.
Who told you kung fu is just a good start?

05:35.821 --> 05:38.755
So that's it.
You mean to say my kung fu is lousy?

05:39.621 --> 05:41.688
It's not as bad as that,
but it isn't the greatest.

05:42.661 --> 05:45.161
Suppose you show me
exactly what's wrong with it.

05:46.261 --> 05:48.495
Right. Just take a look
at your panther sees fire.

05:49.020 --> 05:51.521
- What's wrong with it?
- Look at that spread between your paws.

05:52.141 --> 05:53.674
That's an open invite.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.520
And that horse's stance
is completely bowlegged.

05:57.060 --> 05:58.327
I bet on one sweep that I...

06:02.059 --> 06:03.826
There, you've been thrown, yeah?

06:04.299 --> 06:05.266
Just wait.

06:14.858 --> 06:16.858
Shut up! Shut up, you turkeys!

06:20.937 --> 06:23.204
You'd like to test your teacher's kung fu,
would you?

06:23.738 --> 06:25.738
And magpies can't fly, can they?

06:27.817 --> 06:30.651
I can stand almost anything, you bum!

06:31.296 --> 06:33.330
But I've taken enough of this bullshit.

06:33.816 --> 06:34.917
Right. Come on!

06:41.415 --> 06:43.216
You're wide open.
Do you know that, teacher?

06:43.655 --> 06:44.389
What?

07:06.533 --> 07:08.233
See how good his horse stance is?

07:10.693 --> 07:11.993
Potbelly! Shut up!

07:19.892 --> 07:21.159
Look, right foot.

07:23.972 --> 07:25.438
Cheat, cheat, cheat!

07:25.811 --> 07:26.811
Bastard!

07:28.171 --> 07:29.071
Fresh roosters.

07:29.331 --> 07:30.598
Get your fresh roosters here.

07:32.730 --> 07:34.797
You know, Freddie? You're the cat's ass...

07:35.290 --> 07:37.023
...making old crow face dance like that.

07:37.450 --> 07:39.117
He's always so full of bullshit.

07:39.530 --> 07:42.230
He thinks he's God's gift to kung fu.
Just to see him makes me puke.

07:42.850 --> 07:45.617
- You sure made him dance.
- You should have seen his face.

07:46.650 --> 07:49.717
You sure did all of us a favour,
that's for sure.

07:53.209 --> 07:55.542
- That's not bad.
- So have some more then.

07:56.128 --> 07:58.562
Dumbhead.
I was talking about that chick there.

08:00.008 --> 08:02.475
That perfect frame she's got. Sexy!

08:04.087 --> 08:05.354
- How much?
- That one is 76.

08:05.688 --> 08:07.121
You mean that one in the red?

08:07.487 --> 08:10.021
Imagine what it'd be like
to be kissed by that chick.

08:10.607 --> 08:12.374
Kissing her is for children.

08:12.807 --> 08:14.374
I could get that broad to hug me.

08:14.766 --> 08:17.266
- Come on!
- She wouldn't.

08:17.846 --> 08:20.146
- You wanna bet on it?
- I'll bet you a whole dinner.

08:20.686 --> 08:24.186
She's hot, that kind.
She won't even take a second look at you.

08:24.966 --> 08:26.500
- Come on.
- All right.

08:26.885 --> 08:28.419
A whole dinner then.

08:33.485 --> 08:34.385
Watch.

08:35.605 --> 08:37.238
He's in for trouble.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.624
- What is it?
- It's agony!

08:45.964 --> 08:47.764
- Something's in my eye.
- What's the matter?

08:48.204 --> 08:50.937
Blow it out, please. Can't you help me?

08:51.563 --> 08:52.563
Can you?

08:54.124 --> 08:55.424
One more, huh?

08:56.883 --> 08:58.483
- He did it!
- Did you see that?

08:58.883 --> 09:01.016
Thanks a lot. Hey, a snake! There!

09:03.962 --> 09:06.463
It's all right. Don't be scared. I'll kill it.

09:07.041 --> 09:08.841
- That's a technique.
- Sure is.

09:09.281 --> 09:11.881
I gotta try that on your sister.

09:12.481 --> 09:13.848
On my sister?

09:17.441 --> 09:20.208
Thought you could come fresh
with my daughter, did you?

09:23.361 --> 09:27.028
Me, touch her? She was asking for it.
Dumb bitch.

09:28.799 --> 09:31.133
Don't deny it.
You just wanted to lay your filthy hands...

09:31.719 --> 09:34.653
On her? That's a laugh.
She's much too ugly for that.

09:35.719 --> 09:37.252
Think you're real smart, huh?

09:37.639 --> 09:39.272
I'll teach you a lesson, boy.

09:50.277 --> 09:52.111
So, you want to play at kung fu.

09:52.557 --> 09:53.657
Try this!

10:04.956 --> 10:07.456
- She's not joking.
- The old bitch is tough.

10:11.675 --> 10:13.575
Hey, guys, you gotta help me.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.648
Some friends they make.

10:30.994 --> 10:33.661
You're nothing but a skinny old woman,
so I'll let you win.

10:44.552 --> 10:45.786
Fresh peas. Fresh...

10:46.393 --> 10:47.459
Son of a...

10:49.752 --> 10:52.352
What's your game?
Stumbling about like some drunken stooge.

10:52.952 --> 10:54.185
Don't answer back there.

10:54.992 --> 10:56.159
Hey, Jerry!

10:56.752 --> 10:58.252
Come, who'll buy?

11:00.270 --> 11:01.937
See, mister. Jade antique.

11:04.951 --> 11:06.484
- Is it real?
- But of course, sir.

11:06.870 --> 11:09.203
It's an heirloom, mister.
It's worth money, sir.

11:10.230 --> 11:12.264
- How much is it?
- $10.

11:12.749 --> 11:15.050
That's very expensive. Come.

11:16.429 --> 11:19.230
- Here.
- Just 10 cents?

11:21.989 --> 11:23.823
- Mister, you can't give me this.
- Hands off!

11:24.268 --> 11:25.668
This wouldn't buy an old plate.

11:26.028 --> 11:28.295
I couldn't sell such a valuable piece
for only 10 cents.

11:28.828 --> 11:30.928
You don't want to sell,
you give me my money back.

11:31.428 --> 11:32.561
But my jade!

11:35.108 --> 11:37.008
That was all I had in the world, sir.
Pay for it!

11:37.467 --> 11:39.434
You expect payment from me? Take this!

11:40.827 --> 11:42.360
Daddy, are you all right?

11:42.747 --> 11:44.814
Please, at least give me something.

11:45.306 --> 11:46.140
Sure.

11:46.427 --> 11:48.127
Daddy! Daddy!

11:49.306 --> 11:50.706
What's wrong, old man?

11:51.066 --> 11:52.999
He smashed my jade, and he won't pay.

11:57.305 --> 11:58.772
Shithead. Piss off.

11:59.785 --> 12:02.486
- Think you're talking to your mother?
- I'll see you rot in hell!

12:05.345 --> 12:06.912
You'd better hand over this man's money.

12:07.305 --> 12:07.971
Pay?

12:08.184 --> 12:09.851
Not before I put you in the ground.

12:10.265 --> 12:12.031
It's too bad you feel that way. Know why?

12:12.464 --> 12:15.964
There's nothing been going right today,
so you caught me in a bad mood.

12:17.184 --> 12:19.484
Now, I'm gonna have to teach you
how to pay.

12:50.301 --> 12:51.667
You're mad, huh?

13:04.219 --> 13:05.485
You almost killed me!

13:16.218 --> 13:17.785
My knuckles were barely missed.

13:25.936 --> 13:28.003
- This is for you. Now get going!
- Thank you, sir.

13:40.655 --> 13:42.756
That's enough. I'm dying.

13:43.455 --> 13:45.622
Don't worry. You're safe.
It's only the blunt side.

13:49.655 --> 13:51.455
I have no intention of killing you...

13:51.895 --> 13:53.028
...yet.

13:58.814 --> 13:59.948
Please!

14:01.893 --> 14:03.960
- That one really came close.
- I beg of you!

14:04.454 --> 14:05.987
And watch what you're doing.

14:07.933 --> 14:09.233
Drop dead.

14:11.292 --> 14:14.059
Now, begin to dance to my tune,
or I'll make you sing for supper.

14:19.612 --> 14:21.479
You're fortunate
because it seems I do miss...

14:21.932 --> 14:23.599
...although it's quite by accident.

14:24.011 --> 14:25.078
Oh, please!

14:27.171 --> 14:29.104
I chop, chop, chop this meat.

14:29.571 --> 14:31.471
So then I slice, slice, slice.

14:31.931 --> 14:34.698
And then I beat, beat, beat.
Mix it all together!

14:35.331 --> 14:37.231
It sure has brightened the day I met you.

14:44.809 --> 14:46.876
You know this? It must be at least...

14:47.609 --> 14:49.476
...10 years, brother,
since we've seen each other.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.896
And you hardly look a day older.

14:52.689 --> 14:54.656
I would not have recognized my niece.

14:55.689 --> 14:56.856
She isn't a bad girl...

14:57.168 --> 14:59.202
...just a bit naive.

14:59.848 --> 15:02.215
- And where is Freddie?
- That young rascal.

15:02.768 --> 15:05.468
He's a handful. Always out with his pals,
getting into trouble.

15:06.088 --> 15:08.221
Very grown up now.
You won't recognize him.

15:08.728 --> 15:10.861
By the way, you'll stay for a few days?

15:12.767 --> 15:13.600
Freddie.

15:14.447 --> 15:16.347
I say, Freddie, come and meet your aunt.

15:20.046 --> 15:23.046
- Come on, lad.
- I'll... Coming.

15:32.485 --> 15:33.518
Say hello.

15:34.845 --> 15:36.545
Hello, Auntie, cousin.

15:36.964 --> 15:38.631
- Hello.
- Hello, Freddie.

15:39.125 --> 15:40.158
What on earth's the matter?

15:40.445 --> 15:42.845
I seem to have pulled a muscle in my neck.

15:43.404 --> 15:45.871
I'll soon put that right.
Here, let your aunt fix that.

15:46.443 --> 15:49.077
- I'll be all right.
- Relax just for a second.

15:51.643 --> 15:52.510
Oh, dear.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.236
Oh, Mother.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.557
- Well, you feel better?
- Thank you, yes.

16:01.842 --> 16:02.909
Be all right now.

16:03.482 --> 16:06.249
Your son's grown
into a real smart-looking fellow.

16:06.922 --> 16:09.722
Yes, he's quite clever.
Also, his kung fu's not bad.

16:10.881 --> 16:14.081
Oh? I should like to see
his kung fu sometime.

16:15.001 --> 16:17.101
All right. You would enjoy a match.

16:17.761 --> 16:19.861
I believe that you are strict with him,
from all accounts.

16:20.361 --> 16:22.361
I've heard he's regarded highly
in the neighbourhood.

16:22.841 --> 16:24.407
That's a fact? Tell me what they say.

16:24.920 --> 16:26.987
They've said
that he's courteous and polite...

16:27.480 --> 16:29.913
...setting other boys a good example,
well-mannered.

16:31.919 --> 16:34.853
That makes me really proud
to be his father. Come here, son.

16:42.398 --> 16:44.898
I'm so glad he isn't like the other boys
around here.

16:45.478 --> 16:47.112
They're real sex maniacs.

16:47.838 --> 16:48.938
That's right. Only today...

16:49.238 --> 16:51.905
...my own daughter
was attacked by one of them.

16:52.517 --> 16:56.084
Besides that, when I went to rescue her,
he even attacked me.

16:57.917 --> 17:01.117
You mean to tell me both of you
were attacked here in my own town?

17:02.037 --> 17:03.603
Would you recognize him?

17:06.156 --> 17:08.756
As if I could forget. Yes, I'd recognize him.

17:09.515 --> 17:11.882
And when I find him,
I'll flay the skin off his back.

17:12.435 --> 17:14.135
Freddie, come along.

17:15.236 --> 17:17.469
- Uncle, there's really no need.
- But why?

17:17.994 --> 17:20.428
Because he's in this very room
standing quite near us.

17:21.273 --> 17:23.175
- But where?
- Standing right over there.

17:23.714 --> 17:24.981
Your precious son Freddie.

17:28.314 --> 17:29.114
What?

17:30.674 --> 17:31.607
It can't...

17:36.154 --> 17:37.554
Down on your knees!

17:38.034 --> 17:38.900
Please!

17:39.153 --> 17:41.887
You'll pay for this, you scum, you criminal!

17:49.232 --> 17:50.399
Oh, my gosh.

18:02.230 --> 18:03.064
Robert Wong.

18:03.310 --> 18:05.310
Yes, Mr. Lee. What has happened?

18:06.630 --> 18:09.564
I'll tell you what.
That bastard son of yours beat him up!

18:12.750 --> 18:14.083
Why should he do that?

18:14.430 --> 18:17.364
Because he's nothing but a wild animal.
Viciously attacked my son...

18:18.029 --> 18:20.529
...breaking his legs, arms,
and the poor boy's skull.

18:23.349 --> 18:25.516
Oh, my. He really beat him up.

18:26.029 --> 18:29.729
- He looks like a dumpling.
- Well, what are you going to do?

18:32.148 --> 18:32.948
Father!

18:33.428 --> 18:35.395
You vermin from hell!
I'll beat you to death!

18:35.867 --> 18:37.001
Please, Father!

18:38.467 --> 18:39.901
Brother, you musn't kill your own son.

18:40.267 --> 18:42.601
Yes! I've got to kill this devil.

18:43.147 --> 18:44.713
He's a disgrace to the name of Wong.

18:45.626 --> 18:47.460
Sounds bad
for a teacher of your standing...

18:47.907 --> 18:49.574
...to flog his own son to death.

18:50.627 --> 18:52.793
If he's got to be punished, I suggest that...

18:53.786 --> 18:56.286
...Mr. Lee here is quite capable.

18:59.625 --> 19:00.625
Stop him!

19:01.985 --> 19:04.552
It was your son I beat,
so let him punish me.

19:05.344 --> 19:06.778
There.

19:07.265 --> 19:09.532
Now, you hit me.
I promise I won't fight back.

19:11.744 --> 19:13.244
So you're funny, huh?

19:13.984 --> 19:16.218
All right, Mr. Wong.
What are you gonna do?

19:17.264 --> 19:19.764
As from this moment, I disown him.

19:20.344 --> 19:22.211
This slime is no longer mine.

19:22.663 --> 19:23.997
Do what you like with him.

19:26.222 --> 19:28.356
So my suggestion: You pick your man.

19:29.023 --> 19:31.590
He'll fight Freddie,
who'll be strictly forbidden to fight back.

19:32.223 --> 19:33.823
Ten strokes should be enough.

19:34.302 --> 19:36.636
Now, Mr. Lee, do you approve
of the punishment?

19:39.061 --> 19:41.862
Ten strokes won't be needed.
I'm gonna do it in three.

19:45.221 --> 19:46.188
Master.

19:47.341 --> 19:49.241
Hear? I'm gonna fix that squid.

19:49.701 --> 19:51.668
And be sure you leave him
looking just like I am now.

20:39.696 --> 20:40.629
The divine eight.

20:41.175 --> 20:43.509
That palm style of yours,
it's really something.

20:44.775 --> 20:46.042
I'm only starting.

20:55.294 --> 20:56.427
I'm not dead yet!

21:17.292 --> 21:18.159
Enough.

21:20.692 --> 21:22.492
You've made your ten hits now, Mr. Chow.

21:24.091 --> 21:26.092
And you said you'd put me down in three.

21:31.171 --> 21:33.038
Snake and crane together.

21:35.450 --> 21:37.817
- What?
- Strike the vital points.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.157
Let's try a divine eight again.

21:54.689 --> 21:56.256
I told you I got style.

22:44.604 --> 22:46.504
Hey, my jacket's getting dirty. Take it.

22:58.762 --> 23:01.296
I bet you regret
you didn't pay for that jade.

23:04.442 --> 23:05.509
You got the wrong guy!

23:11.441 --> 23:12.708
Are you all right, master?

23:14.441 --> 23:15.408
You idiot!

23:27.680 --> 23:31.113
Master, now I look just like you do.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.946
Okay. You win.

23:35.439 --> 23:38.406
Smart of you to play that trick on us.
I'll get you back. Let's go.

23:39.119 --> 23:41.252
You haven't heard the last of this.
Let's get out of here.

23:41.758 --> 23:44.058
Careful with my son. I'll get you yet!

23:44.598 --> 23:45.965
I didn't know your son could fly.

23:47.357 --> 23:49.057
Careful, careful.

23:49.477 --> 23:51.077
He came in a furor
with one ragged cripple.

23:51.477 --> 23:54.011
He left in a furor
with two on the stretcher.

23:55.797 --> 23:58.064
You fight quite well.
I must give you credit.

23:58.677 --> 24:00.410
- But I'll still kill you!
- Oh, no.

24:01.756 --> 24:03.723
You mustn't kill a child of your blood.

24:04.277 --> 24:06.077
Break his wicked ways through practice.

24:06.596 --> 24:08.830
I've tried everything
with that young bastard. Right!

24:09.396 --> 24:11.563
From now on, you won't be allowed
to leave this house.

24:12.236 --> 24:14.303
We'll start with five hours horse stance.

24:59.791 --> 25:00.624
Cold.

25:02.190 --> 25:03.490
Now, don't move.

25:05.150 --> 25:06.550
Have some more water.

25:10.110 --> 25:11.010
There.

25:13.550 --> 25:16.283
Hey, your horse's stance is improving.

25:20.429 --> 25:22.762
Are your legs a bit shaky? They aching?

25:23.549 --> 25:27.049
You know, I feel real sorry for you.
Chicken, chicken!

25:37.467 --> 25:39.001
I bet you this will tickle.

25:44.187 --> 25:46.287
Stop. Don't do that.

25:46.787 --> 25:48.353
Just what exactly are you trying to do?

25:48.786 --> 25:52.120
Carrying out my orders.
See, it's your father's idea.

25:52.866 --> 25:54.733
He says for every bowl you break...

25:55.185 --> 25:57.419
...you stay another hour, you bastard!

26:08.545 --> 26:09.978
Darned idiot.

26:46.021 --> 26:46.955
Master.

26:53.060 --> 26:55.361
Yes, his stance appears
to be pretty steady.

26:55.980 --> 26:57.680
- You're sure he hasn't had a test?
- Oh, no.

26:58.100 --> 27:00.000
I've been watching him just like a hawk.

27:00.460 --> 27:02.060
- Absolutely not.
- You're certain?

27:03.379 --> 27:05.179
- Well, you have problems?
- Sure.

27:05.780 --> 27:07.613
I feel very tired.

27:08.419 --> 27:10.419
- Tired? You don't seem to be.
- I am, sir.

27:11.139 --> 27:13.439
You mean you're tired,
though you're sitting on a chair?

27:14.538 --> 27:16.738
What? Sitting on a chair? Let me see.

27:17.258 --> 27:19.125
Oh, my God! So he is! On a chair!

27:20.137 --> 27:21.371
You young criminal.

27:22.098 --> 27:23.765
I've tried to teach you, but no.

27:24.417 --> 27:26.651
Well, it leaves me no alternative then.

27:27.897 --> 27:30.464
I will have to ask your great uncle
to come and discipline you.

27:31.056 --> 27:32.156
Who's that?

27:32.576 --> 27:33.743
So Hai.

27:38.296 --> 27:38.896
You stepped on my foot again!

27:55.335 --> 27:57.702
Hurry up, beanhead.

27:58.494 --> 28:00.794
- It's choking me.
- Won't be a second.

28:01.493 --> 28:02.760
Oh, hurry.

28:08.933 --> 28:11.233
Practicing your kung fu upside down, huh?

28:11.773 --> 28:13.640
- I'm dying.
- I'll get you something to eat.

28:15.053 --> 28:15.919
Here.

28:18.052 --> 28:21.452
- Wait, I'll I get some water.
- Get this thing off my neck.

28:22.212 --> 28:24.112
- Okay.
- It's killing me.

28:26.251 --> 28:27.251
Hurry!

28:37.731 --> 28:38.997
Come on, get up.

28:40.170 --> 28:41.870
Why did you get down so fast?

28:52.289 --> 28:53.456
Here, eat this.

28:54.289 --> 28:56.889
Hey, is it true So Hai is gonna train you?

28:57.568 --> 28:59.802
- That's tight.
- That's sure bad news for you.

29:01.688 --> 29:03.488
You know what they say
about that bastard?

29:04.567 --> 29:06.268
I know he's a bit tough.

29:06.887 --> 29:09.254
He's far worse than that.
You'll be crippled for life.

29:10.247 --> 29:12.414
- How's that?
- I'm telling you, honest.

29:13.126 --> 29:14.093
I'm not kidding.

29:14.367 --> 29:16.834
I knew one young guy
who was his student.

29:17.567 --> 29:19.300
- Gee, was he a mess.
- What?

29:20.206 --> 29:22.373
He lost all his teeth. His hair torn out.

29:23.086 --> 29:25.753
Should have seen his busted nose.
His own father didn't know him.

29:26.446 --> 29:27.512
That monster devil...

29:27.965 --> 29:30.099
...he's a real sadist, a torturer.

29:33.084 --> 29:35.885
- But what can I do?
- You sure better do something.

29:37.285 --> 29:38.785
Sure. I gotta think fast.

29:39.285 --> 29:40.885
Think, damn you. Think!

29:49.844 --> 29:51.344
Let's see. You might...

29:51.723 --> 29:53.690
We run like hell!

29:54.163 --> 29:55.930
That's not running. Come on.

29:56.362 --> 29:57.963
- Come on, hurry.
- Yeah, okay!

29:58.362 --> 29:59.629
Follow me.

30:05.041 --> 30:06.442
Cookies.

30:06.801 --> 30:09.135
Cookies. All right. Take a seat there.

30:24.879 --> 30:26.980
Excuse me. Do you mind if I sit here?

30:27.479 --> 30:29.346
No, sit down. Go on.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.567
You're all by yourself. That's good.

30:31.999 --> 30:34.200
- I don't like eating on my own.
- Go on, sit down.

30:35.559 --> 30:36.993
This restaurant's not bad, huh?

30:37.358 --> 30:40.259
Just look at the colour of their food.
So red and juicy.

30:40.918 --> 30:43.419
Real good smell. Really fantastic, huh?

30:46.558 --> 30:48.325
What can I get you, sir?

30:48.757 --> 30:50.491
This is such a surprise.
Where's your friend?

30:50.918 --> 30:52.751
- What's that?
- No, go ahead, eat.

30:53.198 --> 30:54.265
For you, sir?

30:54.557 --> 30:57.091
We'll start with a bowl of shark's fin.

30:57.677 --> 30:59.810
- Sorry. We got no shark's fin.
- That's too bad.

31:00.317 --> 31:02.684
Soy pork, roast goose with plenty of fat.

31:03.236 --> 31:06.103
- Steamed grouper.
- Sorry, sir. No grouper.

31:06.756 --> 31:08.356
Never mind. Just bring what you have.

31:08.756 --> 31:10.823
Stewed abalone, shrimp noodles,
and be quick about it.

31:11.315 --> 31:12.882
Yes, sir.

31:13.276 --> 31:15.209
- A pint of wine. Right away.
- One wine.

31:16.995 --> 31:18.562
Can you really eat as much as that?

31:18.955 --> 31:20.721
Yeah, easy. I'm growing still.

31:21.154 --> 31:23.188
Gotta keep myself strong and fat.

31:41.353 --> 31:43.020
Here, sir.

31:43.433 --> 31:45.500
That's great. Oh, boy!

31:45.992 --> 31:47.626
Now we eat. Give me!

31:48.032 --> 31:49.299
That's okay.

31:50.832 --> 31:52.632
- Have a little wine. Be my guest.
- Really, I...

31:53.072 --> 31:54.905
- Drink up. This looks good.
- Most kind of you.

31:55.351 --> 31:57.084
Oh, boy, I'm starving.

31:57.511 --> 31:59.411
Here, just taste that.

31:59.871 --> 32:01.138
Eat up!

32:02.911 --> 32:05.711
Go on, don't be shy.
Help yourself to what you want.

32:06.351 --> 32:08.417
Enjoy yourself.
Don't stand on ceremony. Here.

32:08.910 --> 32:10.110
- To us.
- Cheers.

32:19.109 --> 32:20.542
Go on!

32:20.909 --> 32:22.209
Say, boy...

32:37.748 --> 32:39.281
He sure gets the food down him.

33:12.784 --> 33:13.951
Feels great.

33:20.983 --> 33:22.250
That's more comfortable.

33:27.303 --> 33:29.203
I feel a different man now.

33:33.022 --> 33:33.856
That's living.

33:35.702 --> 33:37.268
Oh well, friend.

33:39.022 --> 33:41.555
They sure know how to cook here.
That meal was really something.

33:42.141 --> 33:43.874
Delicious. Now, listen, friend.

33:44.301 --> 33:46.201
I gotta move now, but I got an idea.

33:46.661 --> 33:48.828
Tonight I insist you've gotta be my guest.
Don't worry.

33:49.340 --> 33:51.907
I'll pay as I'm leaving.
We'll meet again tomorrow night.

33:52.500 --> 33:54.300
You must finish your dinner, okay?

33:55.100 --> 33:56.767
See you tomorrow. 'Bye for now.

33:58.219 --> 33:59.953
- Sorry.
- See you tomorrow.

34:02.099 --> 34:03.432
That'll be exactly $1.05.

34:05.979 --> 34:07.879
- I ain't gonna pay.
- You're not?

34:08.338 --> 34:09.605
Well, who is?

34:11.018 --> 34:13.085
The old guy over there. He's paying.

34:16.777 --> 34:19.777
- He's a good friend of yours?
- I'm his son, you idiot!

34:20.456 --> 34:21.591
Is that so, now?

34:22.297 --> 34:23.730
Just how many fathers do you have?

34:24.737 --> 34:26.737
For your information,
that guy owns this place...

34:27.217 --> 34:28.751
...and you're talking to his son.

34:29.136 --> 34:31.003
I guess that leaves you a bastard.

34:32.016 --> 34:34.384
Thought that the meals went free here?

34:35.255 --> 34:37.056
We don't give credit,
so get your money out.

34:45.695 --> 34:48.428
I ain't poncing meals from you.
Forgot my money, that's all.

34:49.255 --> 34:51.987
I'll fetch it right now
and I'll pay your check.

34:52.614 --> 34:53.447
Oh, yeah?

35:02.894 --> 35:05.161
Yeah, I can read. No credit.

35:07.054 --> 35:08.754
Gorilla, you just take him.

36:05.888 --> 36:08.021
No, hold it, hold it. Hold it. Stop.

36:15.287 --> 36:18.354
Bastard pig you ate.
You were so greedy for all that food.

36:19.047 --> 36:21.247
Now, spit the lot out. Yes, right out.

36:26.286 --> 36:27.952
One roast goose.

36:32.725 --> 36:34.425
One soy pork out.

36:35.245 --> 36:38.679
- That's enough.
- And one pint of wine yet.

36:43.604 --> 36:46.205
Now that you unloaded my belly,
I feel hungry again.

36:57.482 --> 37:00.016
Break it up right now,
or do you wanna kill the boy?

37:00.602 --> 37:03.636
He's not finished yet.
He's gonna clean the toilets up.

37:08.362 --> 37:09.995
You wanted something to clean, huh?

37:16.441 --> 37:17.741
Thanks, old man.

37:20.121 --> 37:22.354
You dare to interfere in our business?

37:23.201 --> 37:25.368
I'm the Gorilla. Watch how I jump!

37:29.520 --> 37:30.353
Jump then.

37:33.599 --> 37:34.899
Now he's jumping, all right.

37:38.079 --> 37:39.146
It hurts!

38:01.357 --> 38:03.124
Here's how to wash your face.

38:41.472 --> 38:42.739
You thief!

38:46.312 --> 38:48.846
- Let's be friends. Please.
- Okay, let's be friends.

39:02.631 --> 39:05.564
You've got strength in your arms,
but you've brains of straw.

39:06.990 --> 39:08.524
Stop that. Stop that.

39:19.949 --> 39:20.783
This way.

39:31.908 --> 39:33.041
You know what?

39:33.348 --> 39:35.648
I can't help wondering how old you are,
old man.

39:36.187 --> 39:37.987
For your age, you sure are tough.

39:38.427 --> 39:39.827
A necessity.

39:40.187 --> 39:43.254
I've had to be tough to be able
to survive to this age.

39:44.107 --> 39:47.174
No, I'm not like young men today.
None of you can fight.

39:47.866 --> 39:49.166
Always getting thrashed.

39:52.946 --> 39:54.913
Today wasn't a good day.
Just bad luck, really.

39:55.386 --> 39:58.086
Usually I'm tremendous.
With just one blow, I'd have done the lot.

39:58.706 --> 40:00.306
You've still gotta see my real style.

40:02.105 --> 40:04.072
That sounds to me like an excuse.

40:05.025 --> 40:08.392
I forgot to ask you what your name is
and why you couldn't pay for your meal.

40:10.465 --> 40:14.098
That's a long story, mister.
And what's your name, anyhow?

40:15.704 --> 40:16.837
It's Mr. So.

40:17.903 --> 40:21.070
There's a fellow with that same name
screwing up my life!

40:23.143 --> 40:26.377
- That's why I'm here on the run.
- Who is he?

40:27.103 --> 40:28.869
He's this creep named So Hai.

40:29.302 --> 40:31.702
It was my own father
asked for this guy to fix me.

40:32.382 --> 40:35.249
- You afraid then?
- What? I'm not afraid at all.

40:36.101 --> 40:38.168
Though I've heard it said
he's real cunning...

40:39.181 --> 40:40.281
...violent and mean.

40:40.662 --> 40:42.729
But one day I'm gonna fix him!

40:43.461 --> 40:44.495
That old fart.

40:44.780 --> 40:46.914
Wait till I see him. I'll tear him apart!

40:47.421 --> 40:50.254
- You'd fix the old fart?
- Yeah, sure.

40:51.900 --> 40:53.401
Hey, just where do you come from?

40:53.900 --> 40:57.567
I have the sky as a roof,
and I sleep wherever I may.

40:58.380 --> 40:59.747
- You're a bum. That it?
- Sure.

41:00.099 --> 41:02.300
Everyone knows me as So Hai.

41:07.338 --> 41:08.172
So Hai?

41:08.418 --> 41:09.985
That's the name, young fella.

41:29.697 --> 41:32.130
Lucky for me, I got fast legs.
That was a near one.

41:32.697 --> 41:34.330
Not fast enough.

41:36.056 --> 41:37.490
- You run as fast as you like.
- Let go!

41:37.856 --> 41:39.390
You can't get away, though.

41:45.175 --> 41:48.042
Now, you listen.
Your father has paid me well to train you...

41:48.735 --> 41:50.135
...and I'm gonna do it.

41:55.294 --> 41:57.361
It hurts. How long will this take you?

41:59.694 --> 42:01.594
- A day?
- One year exactly.

42:02.054 --> 42:03.587
I'll never make it.

42:11.693 --> 42:13.993
As you already got your loot,
might as well forget it.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.699
I wouldn't do that. I think I'll enjoy it.

42:17.212 --> 42:18.546
I'll see you in hell!

42:25.851 --> 42:27.251
Let go. You're strangling me.

42:34.530 --> 42:35.897
Damn you!

42:37.450 --> 42:40.183
Let me go. You'll break my neck.

42:46.889 --> 42:48.389
Well, you're just a stupid old fool.

42:48.809 --> 42:51.410
You like to pretend
that you're a real tiger, do you?

42:52.169 --> 42:54.302
Well, I'll show you what a tiger's about.

43:06.967 --> 43:08.934
I see your tiger's got a bad paw, eh?

43:27.365 --> 43:28.698
It's still there.

43:42.684 --> 43:43.517
What?

43:44.523 --> 43:46.590
All that kung fu. Looks like dancing.

43:49.243 --> 43:50.277
Crane attacks!

43:52.603 --> 43:54.170
Crane strikes!

43:54.563 --> 43:56.963
Angry crane eats shrimp.

43:58.723 --> 43:59.823
The crane flies.

44:16.041 --> 44:17.874
Your finger's stronger than teeth.

44:21.281 --> 44:22.381
Is it broken?

44:23.240 --> 44:24.407
Now, let's start!

44:27.879 --> 44:29.180
You scared me then.

44:29.519 --> 44:31.153
Climbing trees to get away now!

44:31.960 --> 44:34.193
Bastard. Monkey kung fu.

44:45.758 --> 44:46.691
My leg.

45:01.197 --> 45:02.897
You're choking me.

45:03.317 --> 45:04.417
Ready to learn?

45:05.036 --> 45:07.003
- Help!
- Answer! Answer!

45:07.555 --> 45:09.322
- My poor head.
- Well, are you?

45:10.035 --> 45:11.435
I guess I haven't got much choice...

45:11.795 --> 45:14.262
...but I don't care for your methods
of fighting your pupils.

45:38.593 --> 45:41.260
Let me down! I don't wanna die yet!

45:42.433 --> 45:43.566
That's enough.

45:53.271 --> 45:55.305
I thought you were
supposed to be a teacher.

45:55.791 --> 45:57.725
You'd break a gorilla in half.

45:59.471 --> 46:02.138
All students with style
must learn how to fall.

46:02.790 --> 46:05.424
Right, that was only your first lesson.

46:57.185 --> 46:58.585
Where were you going?

46:58.945 --> 47:01.845
- I was going to have a piss.
- Have a piss over there.

47:02.505 --> 47:03.672
All right!

47:16.943 --> 47:18.744
Now, fill up the right jar to the left jar.

47:25.822 --> 47:27.956
Good. Now, back to the right jar.

47:31.823 --> 47:34.190
Back jar to the front jar.

47:41.021 --> 47:42.788
And now to the right jar.

47:44.221 --> 47:46.121
Now to the front jar.

47:50.821 --> 47:51.887
All right.

47:54.141 --> 47:56.274
Stupid old man, playing games.
"Back jar to left jar."

47:56.780 --> 47:58.847
Breaking my back is what this will do.

48:01.459 --> 48:02.759
Come on, hurry!

48:05.499 --> 48:06.899
My balls are busted.

48:36.016 --> 48:37.116
Come on out of there.

48:47.215 --> 48:47.982
Shit!

48:49.495 --> 48:51.661
Hope you drown in there, you old crank!

49:22.652 --> 49:23.918
Hey, you, get out.

49:27.731 --> 49:29.932
Asshole, get out of here. Can't you hear?

49:31.251 --> 49:33.785
Are you blind?
These pants won't dry on their own!

49:35.330 --> 49:38.264
You're done hanging around here, you bum.
Keep moving your ass.

49:39.210 --> 49:42.210
Who says? This your pad?
And suppose I don't move it?

49:44.129 --> 49:46.330
A big mouth on a wet ass.

49:46.929 --> 49:48.662
It should be taught some manners.

49:58.128 --> 50:00.228
How's it feel? All dry?

50:00.728 --> 50:03.928
Right, little fart. I'll give you dry.
I'll shove you in head first!

50:14.447 --> 50:15.947
Come on. Watch the birdie.

50:33.285 --> 50:34.685
What's that supposed to be?

50:35.285 --> 50:37.852
Kung fu?
Who taught you that load of shit?

50:39.004 --> 50:40.538
No one calls my dad's kung fu shit!

50:55.882 --> 50:58.149
Judging by you,
your old man's kung fu stinks.

50:58.683 --> 51:01.250
I wouldn't ask him
to wipe the shit off my damned asshole.

51:07.881 --> 51:09.815
Perhaps it's better you called me Father.

51:10.481 --> 51:11.748
Get bent, okay?

51:19.840 --> 51:21.440
Sir. Stand up.

51:22.200 --> 51:23.233
Sit down.

51:26.400 --> 51:28.034
You see, all my dogs must obey.

51:53.398 --> 51:55.331
I won't even need my hands
for you, stupid.

51:55.797 --> 51:57.230
You'd better use them!

51:57.597 --> 51:58.730
I'm not scared!

52:10.475 --> 52:12.042
Well, shithead, had enough?

52:12.475 --> 52:14.675
I won't stop until you sink in hellfire!

52:28.114 --> 52:29.647
- Get back!
- What?

52:31.033 --> 52:32.667
Ah, so you're in your turtle shell now.

52:44.472 --> 52:45.673
I could squash you.

52:47.792 --> 52:50.259
Your skull's like butter. It's not worth it.

52:50.832 --> 52:52.966
You can study kung fu for 20 years
if you want...

52:53.471 --> 52:55.038
...but you will never beat me.

53:07.750 --> 53:09.684
Me, kill a nobody like you? No.

53:10.590 --> 53:13.924
Could ruin that good reputation of mine.
Bend down, you little squirt!

53:14.989 --> 53:17.390
Crawl between my legs!
Go clean crud and pissholes!

53:19.189 --> 53:20.289
Crawl!

53:48.946 --> 53:50.113
Hey, hold it.

53:52.866 --> 53:54.133
Aren't these your pants?

54:42.102 --> 54:44.368
<i>Well, now, what's that supposed to be?</i>

54:44.901 --> 54:48.335
<i>Kung fu? Who taught you
that load of shit? Your father?</i>

54:55.100 --> 54:56.267
<i>I could squash you.</i>

54:56.579 --> 54:58.113
<i>Your skull's like butter.</i>

54:58.500 --> 55:01.600
<i>Even if you were to study for 20 years,
you wouldn't beat me.</i>

55:18.018 --> 55:20.018
<i>To kill a nobody like you? No.</i>

55:20.498 --> 55:22.631
<i>It could ruin that good reputation of mine.</i>

55:23.377 --> 55:26.311
<i>Bend down, you little squirt!
You'd best go clean crud and pissholes!</i>

55:27.417 --> 55:29.684
<i>Crawl between my legs! Crawl!</i>

55:45.935 --> 55:46.768
Young devil.

56:43.690 --> 56:45.124
Careful with that wine.

56:45.489 --> 56:47.189
It's one of the best.

56:49.969 --> 56:51.202
It's good, huh?

56:51.928 --> 56:53.462
Let me dry your clothes.

56:58.328 --> 56:59.728
I'll soon get them dry.

57:09.847 --> 57:11.714
Bare knees?
What happened to your pants?

57:14.567 --> 57:15.400
I lost...

57:25.966 --> 57:27.799
- My God! It's burning!
- My coat!

57:28.245 --> 57:29.179
Help!

57:29.445 --> 57:30.279
Get it out.

57:33.044 --> 57:34.878
Oh, look at my coat.

57:37.884 --> 57:38.618
Ready?

58:09.082 --> 58:10.615
My wrists are broken!

58:32.839 --> 58:34.972
My wrists... They hurt.

58:35.479 --> 58:37.079
Your wrists seem to be very weak.

58:44.718 --> 58:46.785
If I were a rabbit, I'd want to eat greens.

58:47.358 --> 58:49.258
The tea's weak, and it's cold again.

58:52.957 --> 58:54.824
Oh, teacher, it gives me a headache now.

58:55.677 --> 58:56.710
You're hungry, eat.

59:04.516 --> 59:06.150
What's wrong? Weak wrists?

59:06.556 --> 59:08.156
Can't pick up your food? Here.

01:00:30.388 --> 01:00:32.122
Teacher, I'm finished.

01:00:33.268 --> 01:00:35.101
- That was quick.
- Yeah.

01:00:36.067 --> 01:00:38.167
Use these smaller cups to empty again.

01:00:40.667 --> 01:00:41.700
You go on.

01:00:43.346 --> 01:00:45.813
I wish I'd known about this part first.

01:00:53.426 --> 01:00:54.926
This is killing me!

01:01:00.265 --> 01:01:01.665
- Hey, Freddie.
- What?

01:01:03.544 --> 01:01:04.844
Crack this walnut for me.

01:01:05.185 --> 01:01:05.952
Sure.

01:01:07.704 --> 01:01:08.538
No.

01:01:10.345 --> 01:01:11.978
You've gotta do it this way.

01:01:13.944 --> 01:01:15.311
There. Now you try it.

01:01:25.742 --> 01:01:26.709
There.

01:02:12.379 --> 01:02:14.546
Please, teacher!
Haven't I cracked enough for today?

01:02:15.058 --> 01:02:16.925
A monkey would die under the strain.

01:02:17.618 --> 01:02:19.385
Why don't we take a walk, huh?

01:02:21.418 --> 01:02:22.551
All right.

01:02:25.298 --> 01:02:27.198
I did it! Good.

01:02:27.656 --> 01:02:28.890
You won again.

01:02:30.496 --> 01:02:31.430
Look at this.

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:33.457
Oh, boy!

01:02:34.056 --> 01:02:36.290
- You're quick at it.
- Yeah.

01:02:38.856 --> 01:02:40.989
Okay, teacher,
what are you gonna bet on it?

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:46.295
Hey there. Get going now.

01:02:46.975 --> 01:02:47.942
What, go now?

01:02:48.775 --> 01:02:50.575
I haven't made my wine money yet.

01:02:52.974 --> 01:02:55.175
I still got to win some more yet.

01:02:55.974 --> 01:02:58.541
- There! Who's betting?
- Get your money on the table.

01:02:59.534 --> 01:03:00.800
Back your winner now.

01:03:04.853 --> 01:03:07.720
- Come on!
- Come on, play!

01:03:08.733 --> 01:03:11.300
Play the game! Play the game!

01:03:11.972 --> 01:03:14.339
Hey, what is this? Come on!

01:03:15.612 --> 01:03:16.679
Can the noise.

01:03:17.892 --> 01:03:18.926
Play.

01:03:20.692 --> 01:03:21.792
You win!

01:03:23.731 --> 01:03:26.732
We've won again!
We've got it right on! This is great!

01:03:28.091 --> 01:03:29.425
I told you he would.

01:03:32.211 --> 01:03:34.311
We've got enough
to buy a decent meal and good wine.

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:36.277
- We're rich!
- Hey, you there.

01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:40.404
Old man. I've got 50 to lose.
I'll play you for it.

01:03:41.410 --> 01:03:42.310
Right.

01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:44.103
This should be good.

01:04:08.927 --> 01:04:11.194
- Go ahead, choose.
- Oh, sure, sit.

01:04:17.247 --> 01:04:18.214
Let's see.

01:04:29.485 --> 01:04:30.952
You see? It's not there.

01:04:31.325 --> 01:04:33.059
- Hold on.
- Hey, what the...

01:04:33.485 --> 01:04:36.318
You think you're quick, huh?
Listen, baldy, my eyes are quicker.

01:04:38.084 --> 01:04:38.984
Lay off!

01:04:41.724 --> 01:04:43.624
You're trying to cheat, huh?

01:04:46.643 --> 01:04:48.643
Police! Police!

01:04:49.483 --> 01:04:50.950
Hey, everybody, run! Let's go!

01:04:58.683 --> 01:05:00.516
You're a dishonest cheat and a dirty thief.

01:05:00.962 --> 01:05:02.562
- Give me back that money!
- Nah!

01:05:03.002 --> 01:05:05.402
You must be joking.
I ain't got no money, you meathead.

01:05:05.962 --> 01:05:08.129
- Don't you recognize who I am?
- Who cares who you are!

01:05:08.761 --> 01:05:11.062
That's right.
And I'll tell you who you're talking to.

01:05:11.601 --> 01:05:13.135
Rat, the Iron-Headed Bullet.

01:05:17.441 --> 01:05:19.107
Oh, wow. That's horrible.

01:05:20.321 --> 01:05:21.421
Scared, are you?

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.334
Hey, baldy! You'd better get this straight.

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.714
You're gonna pay back that money.
I don't care if you're a tiger!

01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.473
I warn you, shitface.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:33.940
I pick who I'm gonna bury next.

01:05:34.679 --> 01:05:37.346
Say your prayers fast,
'cause you're about to feel my iron head!

01:05:57.557 --> 01:06:00.157
- Teacher, his head's much too hard.
- Don't give up now.

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:02.790
Let's see how you stop Iron-Bullet!

01:06:25.635 --> 01:06:26.935
Good. Very good.

01:06:53.151 --> 01:06:54.385
You sure can jump.

01:06:54.791 --> 01:06:56.524
Bet you'd never guess
that's how you'd end up...

01:06:57.151 --> 01:06:58.251
...jumping into someone's pants.

01:06:58.551 --> 01:06:59.551
Why, you...

01:07:26.788 --> 01:07:29.189
Great! It works! Here, hard nut, try this!

01:07:32.747 --> 01:07:35.448
Gong! You still feel like fighting, huh?

01:07:42.027 --> 01:07:43.027
Good boy. Go.

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:45.327
I missed!

01:07:47.106 --> 01:07:47.940
Again.

01:07:51.786 --> 01:07:53.586
Looks like your bullet's got carbuncles.

01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:57.372
That's enough, please!

01:07:58.105 --> 01:07:59.005
Sure.

01:08:14.864 --> 01:08:16.564
Teacher, my wrists are killing me!

01:08:32.301 --> 01:08:33.535
Get up!

01:08:34.942 --> 01:08:38.408
One, two, three, four, five, six...

01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:40.787
Oh, my hands!

01:08:49.819 --> 01:08:51.987
No more exercises.
Go fetch some wine from the village.

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.500
Oh, sure. Okay, teacher.

01:09:05.939 --> 01:09:06.906
Waiter!

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:11.979
- Some more wine in there.
- How much wine, sir?

01:09:13.298 --> 01:09:15.165
Fill the bottle with 3 cups.
That should be enough.

01:09:15.738 --> 01:09:17.238
Red wine or white, sir?

01:09:17.898 --> 01:09:19.764
White wine, you idiot! Be quick!

01:09:25.176 --> 01:09:25.877
Sir?

01:09:26.096 --> 01:09:26.930
Put it down.

01:09:35.935 --> 01:09:36.937
Sure. Yeah.

01:09:47.654 --> 01:09:48.622
Damn it!

01:09:49.934 --> 01:09:52.600
Where's that stupid boy got to
with my wine?

01:10:02.254 --> 01:10:03.287
Where is he?

01:10:09.533 --> 01:10:10.667
That's the fella.

01:10:17.972 --> 01:10:21.239
- Old man, where are you from?
- And who may you be?

01:10:24.251 --> 01:10:27.818
Old man, have you ever heard
of the name King of Bamboo?

01:10:28.851 --> 01:10:30.851
Yes, of course I have.

01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:34.104
I have no doubt So Hai rings a little bell?

01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:36.150
So Hai?

01:10:37.131 --> 01:10:38.464
I and no other.

01:10:40.530 --> 01:10:42.830
- Let's get out of here.
- But hold it, Bamboo.

01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:45.104
- You don't believe that's So Hai?
- Why not?

01:10:45.529 --> 01:10:46.863
See there? His hands.

01:10:48.889 --> 01:10:51.223
So Hai wouldn't be shaking like that,
would he?

01:10:51.809 --> 01:10:53.143
You can see he's a fake.

01:10:58.008 --> 01:11:01.609
Got it. You think you're being funny?
But I ain't taken in so easy.

01:11:02.767 --> 01:11:05.068
But I'm not lying to you.
After all, I am So Hai.

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:06.995
Well, let's see.

01:11:59.123 --> 01:12:00.623
- Teacher!
- Give me the wine!

01:12:11.002 --> 01:12:12.068
It's water!

01:12:18.841 --> 01:12:20.674
You idiot! Now see what you've done.

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.987
Teacher!

01:12:51.398 --> 01:12:52.431
This way!

01:13:24.354 --> 01:13:25.854
So, they were damn lucky.

01:13:26.594 --> 01:13:28.861
Next time I see them
I shall take them apart.

01:13:29.594 --> 01:13:30.461
Let's go.

01:13:54.272 --> 01:13:56.405
That's bad. You must eat after a fight.

01:13:58.071 --> 01:14:01.138
Teacher, you know I'm sorry.
It was all because I spent the money.

01:14:01.831 --> 01:14:03.797
Seems bad luck follows you around.

01:14:04.670 --> 01:14:07.204
I have seen a lot of things
in these past 70 years.

01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:10.730
But till today, I can honestly say
I've never been beaten in a fight.

01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:13.024
It wasn't that Bamboo
was better than you.

01:14:13.429 --> 01:14:15.696
It's because you've got no strength
without your wine.

01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:18.117
You sure can talk.

01:14:19.349 --> 01:14:21.083
It's true. But if I wasn't so badly trained...

01:14:21.509 --> 01:14:24.076
...I could've beat that no-good jerk,
even though he's Bamboo King.

01:14:25.668 --> 01:14:27.668
You mean to say
you think I'm not teaching you right?

01:14:28.148 --> 01:14:29.282
Is that it?

01:14:29.908 --> 01:14:32.241
Well, it's all exercise.
Just falling all over the ground.

01:14:32.788 --> 01:14:34.788
Boring wrist exercises.
How could I win with that?

01:14:41.707 --> 01:14:43.341
Don't you realize your father is...

01:14:43.746 --> 01:14:45.547
...without question, a real good teacher?

01:14:45.986 --> 01:14:48.453
Robert Wong's methods
are some of the best there are.

01:14:49.066 --> 01:14:51.566
So why do you think he asked me
to teach you my style?

01:14:52.466 --> 01:14:54.433
Just so you could torture me.

01:14:56.465 --> 01:15:00.533
He wants you to train with me
'cause he knows I've got a secret style.

01:15:02.185 --> 01:15:05.785
- Tell me about it then.
- The secret of my eight drunk gods.

01:15:06.585 --> 01:15:08.418
Oh, yeah?
I suppose you'll probably teach...

01:15:08.865 --> 01:15:10.598
...the crawl of the drunken cat to me.

01:15:11.544 --> 01:15:13.111
That shows your damned ignorance.

01:15:13.504 --> 01:15:15.837
Dozens and dozens of men
have pleaded with me to teach them.

01:15:16.464 --> 01:15:18.231
Always refuse. So there.

01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.134
Don't be fooled by my staggering around.

01:15:53.621 --> 01:15:55.187
There's power inside to kill.

01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:57.314
It looks real enough, yet it isn't.

01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:00.387
The fact that you're pretending to lose
lets you win.

01:16:19.737 --> 01:16:21.371
So, clever, isn't it?

01:16:22.577 --> 01:16:24.144
So why haven't you shown me yet?

01:16:25.497 --> 01:16:27.430
You must know the importance of basics.

01:16:27.936 --> 01:16:30.470
Without them,
all your work is a waste of time.

01:16:31.256 --> 01:16:32.790
Why do you think I've been pushing you?

01:16:33.177 --> 01:16:35.210
There are basics that you need
in order to master...

01:16:35.696 --> 01:16:37.563
...the techniques of the eight drunken gods.

01:16:38.776 --> 01:16:40.976
- I think you're ready for it.
- Is that right?

01:16:41.536 --> 01:16:43.636
To study my style you'll find it easier...

01:16:44.136 --> 01:16:45.703
...if you have a drink first.

01:16:48.854 --> 01:16:49.988
Come on, drink up.

01:16:57.374 --> 01:16:58.908
Take another cup.

01:17:04.694 --> 01:17:06.627
Now, Freddie, did you go to school, boy?

01:17:07.093 --> 01:17:09.160
Sure. It was awful.
Real stupid professors.

01:17:12.092 --> 01:17:13.326
Drink down the wine.

01:17:15.013 --> 01:17:17.546
- Cups should not rest!
- I'll sing you songs.

01:17:19.172 --> 01:17:20.905
And it'll put your ears to the test, right?

01:17:21.932 --> 01:17:24.899
"Power and wealth are to no avail"

01:17:25.572 --> 01:17:28.138
"Let only our drinking prevail"

01:17:28.971 --> 01:17:30.738
Boy, enough. Enough!

01:17:34.690 --> 01:17:36.991
"A sober man and the sages"

01:17:37.530 --> 01:17:39.164
"are both lost through the ages"

01:17:39.570 --> 01:17:41.671
"But all our brave drinkers never shall die"

01:17:43.849 --> 01:17:46.183
"But all our brave drinkers never shall die"

01:17:46.889 --> 01:17:49.123
Chen Fong produces wine like this
by the ton.

01:17:50.609 --> 01:17:53.143
You know why soldiers
are always so young?

01:17:56.288 --> 01:17:58.288
"Even the king couldn't stop my drinking"

01:17:59.288 --> 01:18:01.755
"Let's drink a toast
to our ship that's sinking"

01:18:04.008 --> 01:18:06.008
"With uplifted cup, I say to the moon"

01:18:09.247 --> 01:18:11.347
"Why does my shadow appear to swoon?"

01:18:12.486 --> 01:18:14.253
"Wine is ready in cup, you see"

01:18:15.566 --> 01:18:16.967
"Put down my cup"

01:18:17.326 --> 01:18:18.626
"The horses are waging"

01:18:18.966 --> 01:18:22.333
"Fallen in the fields of battle,
the soldier says"

01:18:23.086 --> 01:18:24.386
"Who will remember me?"

01:18:26.086 --> 01:18:27.619
"Who will remember me?"

01:18:38.924 --> 01:18:41.591
<i>The god Liu. The drunkard
with internal strength.</i>

01:19:17.721 --> 01:19:21.188
<i>The god Lee. A drunken cripple
with a powerful right leg.</i>

01:19:47.838 --> 01:19:50.672
<i>The god Fat Han.
A drunkard holding a pot in his arms.</i>

01:20:16.715 --> 01:20:20.582
<i>The god Lam. A drunk with
a sudden deadly waist attack.</i>

01:20:46.953 --> 01:20:50.086
<i>The god Chang.
The drunk with the swift double-kicks.</i>

01:21:17.549 --> 01:21:20.750
<i>Drunken So, the god with
the powerful throat lock.</i>

01:21:44.746 --> 01:21:48.247
<i>The artful god Hong. The drunken
flute player with the powerful wrists.</i>

01:22:07.424 --> 01:22:11.058
<i>The god Miss Ho.
The drunken woman flaunting her body.</i>

01:22:20.383 --> 01:22:22.017
Come on, boy. This is serious.

01:22:23.023 --> 01:22:25.090
This style's meant for women, isn't it?

01:22:25.583 --> 01:22:27.450
Miss Ho is a woman, yes, but she's strong.

01:22:27.902 --> 01:22:29.236
Watch me and follow.

01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:51.854
- Can you do it?
- Oh, yeah, it's real easy.

01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:54.321
- Put some energy in it.
- Yeah, okay!

01:22:58.899 --> 01:23:00.533
This is sissy. I won't do it.

01:23:06.419 --> 01:23:10.319
Mr. Wong, just why did you persuade
the people of Bull Hill...

01:23:11.179 --> 01:23:12.546
...not to sell me their property?

01:23:13.218 --> 01:23:14.585
What was your reason for it?

01:23:16.458 --> 01:23:18.425
Was it because of that business
over your son?

01:23:19.138 --> 01:23:22.038
That's a personal issue,
and it will be settled in good time.

01:23:23.217 --> 01:23:25.184
I'm not responsible. What is your game?

01:23:25.778 --> 01:23:27.178
What is yours?

01:23:27.737 --> 01:23:30.771
Mr. Lee, I am most interested to know
why you want to buy Bull Hill.

01:23:31.656 --> 01:23:33.323
As you wish to know, I'll tell you.

01:23:33.737 --> 01:23:36.904
That old graveyard up there,
it's been haunting us for centuries...

01:23:37.616 --> 01:23:39.116
...disturbing family spirits.

01:23:39.696 --> 01:23:42.296
They'll get more than $20 pet lot.

01:23:42.975 --> 01:23:44.275
It's good money for that land.

01:23:44.615 --> 01:23:46.515
Then you butt your nose in
where it isn't wanted.

01:23:46.975 --> 01:23:49.842
- You mean, you want to buy a graveyard?
- Huh? Huh?

01:23:50.495 --> 01:23:52.795
Don't you believe me?
There's a curse on the name of Lee...

01:23:53.335 --> 01:23:54.735
...and it must be exorcised.

01:23:55.135 --> 01:23:57.002
I've got three mistresses without children.

01:23:57.454 --> 01:24:00.154
I'd be content with a chicken egg,
but they can't produce that.

01:24:00.773 --> 01:24:03.340
Or might you be becoming a little senile?

01:24:07.573 --> 01:24:09.774
Yeah, you like to talk some, Mr. Lee.

01:24:10.292 --> 01:24:12.059
I don't find it amusing, I'm afraid.

01:24:12.493 --> 01:24:14.426
- And what's that supposed to mean?
- Just this.

01:24:14.892 --> 01:24:18.092
You want Bull Hill in order that
you can have what's under the ground.

01:24:19.211 --> 01:24:21.178
- Huh? You must be mad!
- The coal.

01:24:21.732 --> 01:24:23.998
- Bull!
- You know very well that Bull Hill...

01:24:24.531 --> 01:24:26.265
...has a rich coal seam downriver.

01:24:26.691 --> 01:24:29.258
And that's a large interest you've got
in Panco Company.

01:24:29.931 --> 01:24:31.464
Yeah. That's why you want to buy...

01:24:31.851 --> 01:24:33.584
...and I'm going to see that you don't!

01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:39.904
There's a real big deposit there.

01:24:40.249 --> 01:24:41.916
Now, Wong, let's cut you in on it.

01:24:42.330 --> 01:24:46.297
As soon as the deal's over,
I'll see that there is 20 percent in it for you.

01:24:47.170 --> 01:24:49.537
Is that so? I'm highly flattered.

01:24:50.249 --> 01:24:51.849
Kind of you, but I refuse.

01:24:52.368 --> 01:24:54.102
In the first instance, it's not yours to give.

01:24:54.529 --> 01:24:56.996
That land belongs to the people here.
Now you can go!

01:24:58.168 --> 01:25:00.335
Robert Wong, don't try to stop me.

01:25:00.888 --> 01:25:03.488
I'll not be thwarted over this.
There's ways and means!

01:25:22.446 --> 01:25:26.113
<i>I will pay you $1,000
for the death of Robert Wong.</i>

01:25:28.766 --> 01:25:29.999
Robert Wong's dead.

01:25:43.364 --> 01:25:45.264
You got everything ready
for the wedding feast?

01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:47.124
Sure. Take a look around.

01:25:52.123 --> 01:25:54.257
See that there's plenty of wine
at table one.

01:26:00.003 --> 01:26:02.070
Well, it's you again, Mr. Stick.

01:26:04.762 --> 01:26:05.962
Big funeral, huh?

01:26:08.521 --> 01:26:09.755
Are you a damn masochist...

01:26:10.082 --> 01:26:11.648
...coming here,
looking for more punishment?

01:26:12.041 --> 01:26:13.175
Are you still itching?

01:26:16.561 --> 01:26:19.628
Yeah, I'm itching, all right.
My hands are restless.

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:22.621
Ah, good. I'll break another dish.

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:25.121
- What's that, sir?
- Filleted boy on stick.

01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:27.187
Go get my stick.

01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:28.807
So, you cook.

01:26:30.439 --> 01:26:31.539
I'll try this.

01:26:33.639 --> 01:26:35.272
Good. Real tasty.

01:26:36.399 --> 01:26:37.233
Master.

01:26:39.799 --> 01:26:40.799
Here's to you.

01:26:42.639 --> 01:26:44.139
I'll have the skin off you.

01:27:12.435 --> 01:27:13.536
Here, bite this.

01:27:16.035 --> 01:27:18.868
Wow! Your teeth are sharp.
Bit tight through the bowl.

01:27:39.233 --> 01:27:40.100
Now what?

01:27:50.671 --> 01:27:52.905
Be careful now, toothy. Take it easy.

01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:06.237
I did tell you to take it easy.

01:28:21.509 --> 01:28:22.676
Sit still there!

01:28:26.028 --> 01:28:27.695
And upsy-daisy.

01:28:30.308 --> 01:28:32.141
And that's called a fart for the Stick King.

01:28:42.107 --> 01:28:45.174
- That's called dog eats shit.
- Not quite.

01:28:51.546 --> 01:28:52.579
No sooner said.

01:30:12.258 --> 01:30:13.392
He's pissed.

01:30:49.175 --> 01:30:53.275
Oh, boy, some good wine.
The old man will like this.

01:30:57.694 --> 01:31:00.394
Teacher, I got some wine for you.
Some real good stuff.

01:31:01.014 --> 01:31:02.480
A present from Mr. Stick.

01:31:06.053 --> 01:31:07.086
Teacher!

01:31:09.333 --> 01:31:10.166
Teacher?

01:31:11.452 --> 01:31:14.719
So Hai, I got something for you.
Hey, teacher!

01:31:25.852 --> 01:31:27.552
<i>Freddie, one year has passed...</i>

01:31:27.971 --> 01:31:30.205
<i>... and the time has come for us
to take our separate paths.</i>

01:31:30.731 --> 01:31:33.231
<i>I have taught you all the techniques
and the magic of kung fu.</i>

01:31:33.811 --> 01:31:36.278
<i>Practice diligently,
master each technique...</i>

01:31:36.850 --> 01:31:39.817
<i>... and remember the eight drunken gods
as the ultimate kung fu.</i>

01:31:40.850 --> 01:31:43.183
<i>My home is the world. Try not to miss me.</i>

01:31:43.930 --> 01:31:45.997
<i>Return home to your father now
and be a good son.</i>

01:31:46.489 --> 01:31:49.223
<i>Just remember, should you ever need me,
I'll come to you.</i>

01:31:50.249 --> 01:31:51.616
<i>So Hai.</i>

01:31:57.488 --> 01:31:58.321
Teacher...

01:31:59.968 --> 01:32:00.935
...don't leave.

01:32:01.208 --> 01:32:04.209
Teacher! Where are you?

01:32:28.285 --> 01:32:30.319
- More straight.
- Master Wong!

01:32:32.004 --> 01:32:33.405
- Master!
- What is it?

01:32:33.765 --> 01:32:36.532
Lee and all his men are digging
up on Bull Hill! About 20 of them!

01:32:37.165 --> 01:32:38.632
- What? You saw them there?
- Yes, sir.

01:32:39.444 --> 01:32:41.744
You, boy, tell my men I'm up on Bull Hill.
Be quick!

01:32:42.324 --> 01:32:43.324
Come on then!

01:32:45.684 --> 01:32:47.817
Ovet this way. Down in the valley.

01:33:19.801 --> 01:33:21.868
Your skill in kung fu is renowned.

01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:24.934
I'd like to compliment you, Mr. Wong.

01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:29.887
Who are you? I haven't met you before.
Why do you want to kill me?

01:33:31.839 --> 01:33:34.939
I'm Thunderleg. For money, I assassinate.

01:33:36.199 --> 01:33:38.332
Today I have an opponent that's worthy.

01:33:38.839 --> 01:33:40.806
I'd like to pay my respects to you.

01:33:42.359 --> 01:33:44.892
I've heard of that cold-blooded assassin
that everyone fears:

01:33:45.478 --> 01:33:47.611
Thunderleg,
who'd sell his brother for money.

01:33:48.798 --> 01:33:49.698
You got it.

01:33:50.918 --> 01:33:53.585
But killing me, you won't find that so easy.

01:33:54.837 --> 01:33:57.170
Then I guess that you'll wish me success.

01:34:17.276 --> 01:34:19.809
Hands over doorknobs,
and legs break down doors.

01:34:29.114 --> 01:34:31.781
You see, 30 percent hands, 70 percent legs.

01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:15.184
Robert Wong, are you ready
to meet your death yet?

01:35:27.588 --> 01:35:30.489
Father, are you all right? Don't worry.
I'm here, all right?

01:35:31.147 --> 01:35:32.981
What are you here for?
This match is mine.

01:35:33.428 --> 01:35:34.728
You'll see. I'm a master now.

01:35:35.067 --> 01:35:37.168
Whoever insulted you pays with his life.

01:35:37.667 --> 01:35:39.201
That I swear. I'll fight now.

01:35:42.267 --> 01:35:43.300
It's you again.

01:35:45.266 --> 01:35:46.800
I'm real glad you got here.

01:35:47.186 --> 01:35:49.220
You can help bury your old man, shitface.

01:35:49.866 --> 01:35:50.966
I'll see...

01:35:51.306 --> 01:35:55.473
Master Wong, it was a real sad day for you
the day you fathered that asshole.

01:35:57.945 --> 01:35:59.912
You watch out,
or you'll have a body with no ass!

01:36:01.625 --> 01:36:06.059
Dumbhead, I suggest you go clean shit,
or I'll have to bury you, too.

01:36:07.024 --> 01:36:09.191
I won't die, bastard,
but the worms'll grow fat on you!

01:36:09.704 --> 01:36:11.837
So, I'm unlucky today.

01:36:12.344 --> 01:36:14.378
Two will die for the price of one.

01:36:15.184 --> 01:36:16.384
Up yours!

01:36:19.664 --> 01:36:22.564
Hey, hold it! Hold it! Wait for me!

01:36:24.262 --> 01:36:26.696
- Wait!
- Teacher! How'd you get here?

01:36:27.462 --> 01:36:28.929
Oh, now we'll really have fun.

01:36:29.303 --> 01:36:31.036
So Hai has to see this fight.

01:36:32.302 --> 01:36:34.069
So Hai, go!

01:36:35.181 --> 01:36:36.782
Go away. This is not your business.

01:36:37.181 --> 01:36:39.548
That's where you're wrong.
It's my business, all right.

01:36:40.102 --> 01:36:43.402
Sure is. Don't be afraid.
I promise that I won't lift a finger.

01:36:44.141 --> 01:36:46.041
That won't be necessary. You'll see.

01:36:46.501 --> 01:36:48.534
He can do it. He'll outwit you every time.

01:36:51.021 --> 01:36:52.354
Hey! Drink, boy!

01:37:32.257 --> 01:37:34.590
Teacher, it's so strong. What is it?

01:37:35.336 --> 01:37:37.303
100 percent proof, White Lightning.

01:37:37.776 --> 01:37:38.810
I'm drunk.

01:38:31.411 --> 01:38:33.311
I'm the drunk with inner strength.

01:38:45.530 --> 01:38:46.630
Cripple Lee!

01:39:13.487 --> 01:39:15.454
The drunk with a strong right leg.

01:39:17.806 --> 01:39:19.940
Rugged, strong leg, go!

01:39:36.004 --> 01:39:39.405
A sudden attack to the waist!
Come on! Show him Fat Han!

01:39:41.965 --> 01:39:44.165
With a big pot in his arms,
Fat Han's gone mad!

01:39:59.522 --> 01:40:01.589
Okay. Not bad.

01:40:02.562 --> 01:40:03.629
Patience.

01:40:04.562 --> 01:40:06.062
You've not seen it all yet.

01:40:07.202 --> 01:40:08.469
Artful Hong.

01:40:12.722 --> 01:40:14.922
He's the flute player
with the strongest wrist.

01:40:18.561 --> 01:40:19.527
Pretty strong.

01:40:41.918 --> 01:40:43.252
Out of tune.

01:40:44.878 --> 01:40:46.078
Your flute is bent.

01:40:47.037 --> 01:40:50.038
Now, throat lock. Powerful lock.

01:40:50.957 --> 01:40:52.258
So, lock it then.

01:41:14.115 --> 01:41:15.582
Now your lock is broken.

01:41:29.234 --> 01:41:30.467
The devil's shadowless hand!

01:41:31.913 --> 01:41:32.913
Very clever.

01:41:35.993 --> 01:41:37.260
Drunken Chang!

01:41:42.553 --> 01:41:44.453
Drunken Chang won't teach old age.

01:42:01.311 --> 01:42:03.044
Your drunken gods, how many left?

01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:06.877
Ho! Ho!

01:42:07.230 --> 01:42:08.997
The drunken Miss Ho.

01:42:14.829 --> 01:42:16.896
- I forgot to do my practice!
- What?

01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:18.703
I didn't bother with it.

01:42:20.909 --> 01:42:23.475
- Can't you teach me now?
- Use my style!

01:42:47.226 --> 01:42:49.393
- Oh, my.
- Freddie!

01:42:50.426 --> 01:42:52.360
She'll appear there without her shadow.

01:42:52.826 --> 01:42:55.460
Just perform the actions.
Watch close and you'll see one.

01:42:56.666 --> 01:43:00.333
Try to combine all seven gods and
try and see her as your own Miss Ho.

01:43:02.345 --> 01:43:04.646
Ho? You want Miss Ho? Sure.

01:43:15.504 --> 01:43:17.471
Damn!

01:43:17.944 --> 01:43:19.410
This is called widow see her lover off.

01:43:26.383 --> 01:43:29.050
That's called fart, old woman on toilet.

01:43:35.981 --> 01:43:37.548
Old woman missed toilet seat.

01:43:44.701 --> 01:43:46.068
Putting on her makeup.

01:43:49.821 --> 01:43:51.821
Pretty girl looks in her glass.

01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:54.440
These are the famous eight drunken gods?

01:43:54.979 --> 01:43:57.646
So, you think that
you're the only master here.

01:43:58.260 --> 01:44:00.360
Let me tell you:
My drunk gods don't mess around.

01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:02.493
Nobody can fight like they do!

01:45:28.931 --> 01:45:31.098
I must be getting addicted.
Here's to Miss Ho!

01:46:19.886 --> 01:46:20.953
He done it.
