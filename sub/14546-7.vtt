In suburbia, the minute
Thanksgiving is over

00:03.294 --> 00:04.879
they're already fiending
for Christmas.

00:04.921 --> 00:08.967
Oh, Tessa! Any interest
in going caroling tonight?

00:09.009 --> 00:10.218
It's November.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.594
And by the time the first frost

00:11.636 --> 00:13.221
had coated the larch

00:13.263 --> 00:15.098
even the sanest of Chatswinians

00:15.140 --> 00:16.641
were prematurely gifting.

00:16.683 --> 00:19.769
Oh-oh, looks like somebody's
stocking was hung

00:19.811 --> 00:22.105
over the chimney with care.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.983
Dad, it's not Christmas.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.484
It's almost Christmas.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.902
Besides, there might be
something in there

00:27.944 --> 00:29.612
that you have to open
right away.

00:41.666 --> 00:44.002
What?
George, what is this?

00:44.044 --> 00:45.712
'It's your itinerary.'

00:45.754 --> 00:47.338
And I know you wanna spend time
in Manhattan

00:47.380 --> 00:50.008
and I know
you wanna get to know your mom.

00:50.050 --> 00:53.428
So I got the two of you
a package, hotel, spa services.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.722
'You guys can
go to the museum, see the tree'

00:55.764 --> 00:58.391

in the city..

00:58.433 --> 01:00.101
...hanging out together.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.020
- But what about you?
- What about me?

01:02.062 --> 01:04.022
I'll-I'll roll with Yakult.

01:05.648 --> 01:08.735
- Did I nail it?
- You nailed it.

01:08.777 --> 01:11.613
While my definition of family
was suddenly expanding

01:11.654 --> 01:14.532
Ryan Shay's was about
to be blown to smithereens.

01:14.574 --> 01:17.077
Family photo
came out real sweet.

01:17.118 --> 01:19.621
Everyone's looking real sweet.

01:19.662 --> 01:22.624
- Oh, wow, look.
- Yeah.

01:22.665 --> 01:24.292
And I just wanna say

01:24.334 --> 01:27.879
well, I-I just think
it's so darn cool that..

01:27.921 --> 01:30.924
...you know, you're as close
to them as you are.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.967
I had to be close, or I wouldn't
fit in the picture.

01:33.009 --> 01:35.178
I just love your whole attitude.

01:35.220 --> 01:39.432
I love that you don't act
like you're...you know.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.892
Better-looking
than everyone else?

01:40.934 --> 01:44.479
No, silly. Like one of us.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.065
- Homosexual?
- No.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.984
I'm adopted, too, you know.

01:50.026 --> 01:53.905
- I'm not adopted.
- Yes, you are.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.783
And I just think it's great
how you embraced your family.

01:56.825 --> 02:02.413
I never did. I always hated
those big, ugly strangers.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.415
- I'm adopted?
- Yeah.

02:04.457 --> 02:07.001
- Like, adopted adopted?
- Mm-hmm.

02:07.043 --> 02:09.212
- Like, adopted?
- That's right.

02:11.047 --> 02:13.258
- This--
- Bless your adopted heart.

Please! Just go!

If my family's
not really my family

Is this real?

Ow! That seems real!

Is this real?
Ow! Oh!

That seems really real, too!

isn't really garbage!

Why is your list blank?

04:04.744 --> 04:06.204
I thought you wanted rims.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.414
I did, but ever since
my nanny left

04:08.456 --> 04:10.291
rims don't seem
important anymore.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.584
But they are important.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.169
They make your ride
hella fresh

04:13.211 --> 04:15.046
and let all the fools
know how you roll.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.632
But they don't mean as much

Well, maybe you could ask Santa
for a housekeeper.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.096
Or is that racial?

You know what?
I don't care if it is racial.

I wanna wake up

04:28.434 --> 04:29.644
and see Carmen under my tree

04:29.686 --> 04:31.354
with a big red bow on her head.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.314
Santa is a really cool person

that he's gonna be able

04:37.944 --> 04:39.153
to bring Carmen back.

04:39.195 --> 04:42.073
Then screw Santa.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.825
I'll get Carmen back on my own.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.827
I'll do like Yeezy did Keezy.

04:45.868 --> 04:48.371
I'll write a song about Carmen,
then I'll shoot a music video

04:48.413 --> 04:50.790
then I'll put it on YouTube,
then I'll hire a publicist

04:50.832 --> 04:53.418
then I'll make it go viral,
then I'll send Carmen a link

04:53.459 --> 04:55.461
then I'll make all the comments
say things like

04:55.503 --> 04:57.046
"Wow, that girl really
loves Carmen."

04:57.088 --> 04:58.506
And "Wow, Carmen
should really go back

04:58.548 --> 05:01.134

important job.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.839

Why do you defend her
when she so clearly judges me?

05:43.009 --> 05:44.677
Admit it, Carmen, you judge me.

05:44.719 --> 05:50.183
I do, because you care more
about your books than your son.

It's like he has his own

That was the only thing
on my Christmas list.

20:32.689 --> 20:34.775
Come on.

20:34.816 --> 20:36.693
- Let's go home.
- Okay.

20:40.656 --> 20:41.907
Hey! Where are you going?

20:41.949 --> 20:43.742
You have my card!

20:43.784 --> 20:45.118
You know where to find me!

20:45.160 --> 20:46.620
(Tessa)
Ryan was still deciding

20:46.662 --> 20:48.080
where home was.

20:48.121 --> 20:50.624
But for me..

20:50.666 --> 20:52.668
...that was a question
I already answered.

20:55.837 --> 21:00.550
♪ Hold on to me as we go ♪

21:03.303 --> 21:08.558
♪ As we roll down
this unfamiliar road.. ♪

21:08.600 --> 21:10.102
Tessa. Merry Christmas.

21:10.143 --> 21:13.188
I wasn't expecting you
till the day after tomorrow.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.482
Wait. What are you doing here?

21:15.524 --> 21:17.192
Is everything okay?

21:17.234 --> 21:19.278
Yeah, dad, everything's great.

21:19.319 --> 21:21.947
♪ Just know you're not alone ♪

21:23.782 --> 21:27.577
♪ 'Cause I'm gonna make
this place your home ♪♪
