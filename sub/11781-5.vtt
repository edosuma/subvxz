WEBVTT

00:06.274 --> 00:07.275
That's me. Jane Quimby.

00:07.308 --> 00:09.810
My life is a little
complicated right now.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.545
I landed
my fashion dream job
working for her,

00:11.579 --> 00:12.546
Gray Chandler Murray.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.315
The only problem,
they think I'm an adult.

00:14.348 --> 00:17.085
Now I am juggling
two secret lives,

00:17.118 --> 00:20.054
one in high school
and one in high fashion.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.455
JANE: Previously on
Jane by Design...

00:21.489 --> 00:23.324
So, about what I
wanted to tell you.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.059
JANE: Incoming.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.494
Okay, Janey,
here's Hi. deal...

00:26.527 --> 00:28.062
What do you want, Lulu?

00:28.096 --> 00:29.197
Just this.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.466
I can explain.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.335
I just want you
to leave me alone.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.836
I can't do this
without you, Janey.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.371
I'm sure you'll be fine.

00:37.405 --> 00:40.074
Besides, you have a seat
at the popular table now.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.209
What are you
Just eating.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.611
Nick. Nice to meet you.

00:43.644 --> 00:44.445
Nick, our table's ready.

00:44.478 --> 00:47.248
I can't do this
without you, either.

00:48.382 --> 00:48.616
You don't have to.

00:54.522 --> 00:59.327
* I'd go beyond
our fighting borders
if you needed that from me

01:02.630 --> 01:08.436
* And I'd march with
decorated soldiers to get
your pretty eyes to see

01:08.469 --> 01:12.240
JANE: In fashion,
it's easy to take even
the smallest wrong turn

01:12.273 --> 01:14.242
and find yourself
totally lost.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.347
* I'd kiss your belly,
and your shoulders

01:19.380 --> 01:22.516
* Cover blankets on our feet

01:22.550 --> 01:24.518
And fashion's
got nothing
on high school.

01:24.552 --> 01:25.686
Nice belt.

01:30.691 --> 01:35.129
* So keep your eyes set
on the horizon

01:35.163 --> 01:38.566
* On the line
where blue meets blue

01:38.599 --> 01:41.369
* And I'll bet
that silver lining

01:41.402 --> 01:44.138
* Well, I know
it'll find you soon *

01:44.172 --> 01:46.140
But, no matter
how lost you are

01:46.174 --> 01:49.377
the trick is to
keep searching.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.412
Because you never
know what you'll find.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.627
* I've my heart where
my head should be

02:06.660 --> 02:10.198
* Light up the rest of me

02:10.231 --> 02:13.701
* 'Cause your dreams,
they won't fall apart

02:13.734 --> 02:15.569
* Through the stops,
the starts

02:15.603 --> 02:18.138
* And life is a work of art

02:25.546 --> 02:28.649
Got it!
Found the Choo!

02:28.682 --> 02:30.284
I do believe
we have a match.

02:30.318 --> 02:30.751
You are a goddess.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.288
Not that much of a goddess.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.724
My work here is done.

02:36.757 --> 02:37.391
Thank you, Jane.

02:37.425 --> 02:39.660
Any time.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.329
Oh, and Jane...

02:42.996 --> 02:45.199
Yeah, I'm not really
loving the belt.

02:45.633 --> 02:48.502
So, about Gray...

02:48.536 --> 02:50.638
Has she said
anything to you?

02:50.671 --> 02:52.506
Said anything about what?

02:52.540 --> 02:55.643
Oh, you know,
it's probably nothing.
I've just...

02:55.676 --> 02:58.346
You know, just
been hearing things.
Probably just rumors.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.012
About me?

02:59.046 --> 03:01.749
About Gray.
And her job.

03:01.782 --> 03:02.983
What about her job?

03:03.016 --> 03:05.486
Just that she
might not have one
by this time next week.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.489
(SCOFFS) Come on.
That's crazy.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.757
Not Gray.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.359
Gray's tough
and talented, and...

03:11.392 --> 03:14.362
And sometimes,
it's about more than that.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.763
You know, politics.

03:15.796 --> 03:18.666
But we work in fashion.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.235
(SIGHS)
You know what?
You're right.

03:21.269 --> 03:22.470
It's nothing.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.538
It's just like I said,
probably just
ridiculous rumors.

03:27.608 --> 03:28.976
Aren't you gonna be
late for your call?

03:29.009 --> 03:29.777
Oh! Right.

03:32.413 --> 03:32.780
(RINGING)

03:38.619 --> 03:40.521
Hello, Gray.
How's Istanbul?

03:40.554 --> 03:42.423
I'm not in Istanbul.

03:42.456 --> 03:45.526
I am not in Istanbul, Jane.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.594
I'm in Paris.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.396
Wait? What?

03:48.429 --> 03:49.663
Jane. ?

03:49.697 --> 03:51.665
I could've sworn
you were in Istanbul

03:51.699 --> 03:53.000
because I booked
the ticket myself
and I just...

03:53.033 --> 03:54.101
JYes?

03:54.134 --> 03:56.537
I need you
to stop talking
and listen carefully.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.506
No one,
and I mean no one
is to know where I am.

03:58.539 --> 03:59.707
Do you understand?

03:59.740 --> 04:02.042
Have you heard of
the Lookbook, Jane?

04:02.075 --> 04:04.278
Yes, of course,

04:04.312 --> 04:06.747
it's all that
a fashion company
is or wants to be.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.717
It's ideas.
It's inspiration.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.652
It's sketches for
upcoming collections.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.355
It's everything.

04:14.388 --> 04:16.624
It needs to
be in my hands
in exactly two days.

04:16.657 --> 04:19.293
I've booked you on
the 10:15 to Paris
tomorrow night.

04:19.327 --> 04:20.628
The 10:15... What?

04:20.661 --> 04:22.330
It's a plane, Jane.

04:22.363 --> 04:25.533
Right. No.
I know. It's just...

04:25.566 --> 04:28.536
Me? To Paris?
You've got to be...

04:28.569 --> 04:30.638
You'll arrive
just after noon.

04:30.671 --> 04:31.839
I need that Lookbook
in my hands by 2:00.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.442
And not a second later.

04:34.475 --> 04:38.346
Wow. I'm not sure
if I can, you know,
pull that off.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.047
If you're not here
Iwith that book,.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.750
then don't bother
coming in to work
on Monday. Understand?

04:42.783 --> 04:44.685
I think that was fairly
straightforward, yes.

04:44.718 --> 04:48.088
Now, take the
Lookbook from the man.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.459
And do not
let it out of your hands
until you place it in mine.

04:51.492 --> 04:52.693
Not for a second.

04:52.726 --> 04:56.864
No one outside or
inside the company
can see it.

04:56.897 --> 05:00.100
Not a soul.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.370
GIs everything what?..

05:02.403 --> 05:04.872
Well, it's just...
People have been talking...

05:04.905 --> 05:07.441
Bring me the book, Jane.
See you in Paris.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.312
I guess
I'm going to Paris.

05:27.528 --> 05:31.899
* Take my hand, baby,
let's get lost

05:31.932 --> 05:33.767
* We'll run around the world
and we'll never stop

05:33.801 --> 05:36.770
* No, oh, oh

05:36.804 --> 05:39.507
* Come on, let's go

05:39.540 --> 05:41.842
(GASPS)

05:41.875 --> 05:44.645
You must be
Tommy's brother.

05:44.678 --> 05:48.516
Um, yeah. That's me.
Who are you?

05:48.549 --> 05:49.783
There you are.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.623
DudeWhat?e on.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.591
It's 7:00 iSo?he morning.

05:57.625 --> 05:58.859
So, you're
standing over my bed
making out with...

05:58.892 --> 06:01.662
Xandra.

06:01.695 --> 06:02.863
With an X.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.933
Hi.

06:05.966 --> 06:09.937
Nice to meet you,
Xandra with an X.

06:09.970 --> 06:10.804
Baby, would you mind
giving us a minute?

06:10.838 --> 06:12.840
Hmm, okay.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.579
What do you think?
Pretty hot, right?

06:18.612 --> 06:19.880
Yep. She's a keeper.

06:20.814 --> 06:21.882
Yes. She is.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.818
And I like Xandra, Bill-bo.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.687
And Xandra
likes nice things.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.789
Which is why
I've hooked us up
with a new score.

06:28.822 --> 06:29.757
You can't pass this up.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.959
I'm talking Grade-A
pharmaceuticals here,

06:31.992 --> 06:34.462
fresh off the dock.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.663
We can quadruple our money.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.665
In a week flat.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.467
And I'll tell you what.
We'll go 50-50 on this one.

06:41.602 --> 06:44.838
I just need 500 bucks.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.306
ThCome on.s.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.642
I know you have
at least that much saved up
from caddying all summer.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.177
So, I can make us
some real money here.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.979
I don't think so.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.181
60-40.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.583
And that's my final offer.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.618
70-30?

06:59.987 --> 07:01.622
Is that a yes?

07:08.662 --> 07:11.532
Did you know this stuff
has 28 grams
of sugar per serving?

07:14.968 --> 07:16.770
I did not know that.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.006
It's really good.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.941
That's great.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.443
Um, what are you
doing tonight?

07:24.645 --> 07:26.480
NoI just...y?

07:26.514 --> 07:28.616
It's nothing.

07:28.649 --> 07:29.783
Actually,
I was thinking about

07:29.817 --> 07:30.984
sleeping over
at a friend's tonight.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.787
Sounds good.

07:33.821 --> 07:36.524
Yeah, it should be fun.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.025
You know,
just a little fun.
Not too much fun.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.960
Very, very little.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.595
Okay, well, I should go.

07:41.629 --> 07:42.663
Wait a second!

07:45.666 --> 07:47.234
We are out of milk.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.002
Can you pick some up
on the way home?

07:49.036 --> 07:50.604
Have a good day.

07:50.638 --> 07:51.038
You, too!

07:51.071 --> 07:54.041
Oh, and Jane.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.476
Whose house
are you sleeping at?

07:57.978 --> 08:00.681
I'm sleeping at, um...

08:00.714 --> 08:01.949
The house of...

08:01.982 --> 08:04.785
My new, suddenly,
super good friend.

08:06.854 --> 08:07.955
Lulu.

08:08.556 --> 08:12.560
Yep. Lulu.

08:12.593 --> 08:15.796
We're trying
to get along.
For Billy's sake.

08:15.829 --> 08:19.099
So we're,
you know, forging this
friendship-ish type thing?

08:24.905 --> 08:25.939
Cool.

08:25.973 --> 08:26.006
Cool.

08:34.848 --> 08:35.983
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

08:43.991 --> 08:44.725
Hi. Good morning.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.767
What was that?

08:53.801 --> 08:54.902
What was what?

08:54.935 --> 08:55.869
That look.

08:56.970 --> 08:57.805
That was nothing.

08:57.838 --> 09:01.742
Billy. That was
definitely something.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.844
Are you...

09:03.877 --> 09:05.713
Are you embarrassed of me?

09:05.746 --> 09:06.747
No, no, no.
You're being crazy, Lulu.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.116
No.
I'm being observant.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.952
Okay.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.822
I just need a little
time to adjust here.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.056
This thing
between us is...

09:16.089 --> 09:18.959
Is what?

09:18.992 --> 09:23.030
Relax. All I meant was,
it's new.

09:25.365 --> 09:25.766
Okay.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.738
You know what?

09:32.973 --> 09:35.342
Who cares what
anybody thinks.

09:35.375 --> 09:36.376
I'm gonna take
this from the top,
gonna start over.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.146
I need a redo, all right?

09:39.179 --> 09:40.681
(EXHALES)

09:43.183 --> 09:43.884
Action.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.053
Hey.

09:46.954 --> 09:47.755
Hi. Good morning.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.765
Now that was much better.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.634
And this?
You and me?

10:00.668 --> 10:02.770
What exactly
are we now, Lulu?

10:02.803 --> 10:05.773
Well. We're not
a secret anymore.

10:05.806 --> 10:08.742
And you're sure
you're okay with that?

10:08.776 --> 10:10.811
I'm more than
okay with it.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.781
You're my boyfriend now.
And I'm...

10:14.948 --> 10:16.183
You're my girlfriend.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.653
Yes. Yes, I am.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.699
Hi.

10:31.732 --> 10:32.432
Hi.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.701
Do I look
different to you?

10:33.734 --> 10:35.836
Uh, No.rcut?

10:35.869 --> 10:38.706
You waxed No.r eyebrows?

10:38.739 --> 10:39.907
New outfit?

10:39.940 --> 10:41.141
Yes. But, that's not it.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.943
You really want me
to keep guessing?

10:42.976 --> 10:44.812
It's this.

10:44.845 --> 10:45.946
Do you see this
look on my face?

10:45.979 --> 10:47.180
I do.
And I know that look.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.048
And that is not
a good look.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.183
Oh, it's good.
It's better than good.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.919
Can you just tell me?

10:51.952 --> 10:54.688
Fine. It's Paris.
Paris, Billy.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.156
I, Jane Quimby,
am going to Paris.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.125
Tonight!

10:58.158 --> 10:59.993
I mean,
it's only for five hours
and 49 minutes

11:00.027 --> 11:01.929
and I'm on the
next flight back
but it's Paris.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.697
A few months ago
I would've been excited

11:03.731 --> 11:05.032
for a day trip to
the Barneys outlet.

11:05.065 --> 11:05.966
And now
I'm going to Paris.

11:05.999 --> 11:10.704
I just need one
teeny, tiny, little favor.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.873
I don't do passports.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.742
I have a passport.

11:14.775 --> 11:17.978
There's another small-ish
to slightly large favor

11:18.011 --> 11:19.947
I need from you
in order to
make this happen.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.952
LULU: Are you nuts?

11:24.985 --> 11:27.454
Jane?
Sleeping at my house?

11:27.487 --> 11:29.957
She's not actually
sleeping at
your house, Lulu.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.993
It's just,
if it comes up,
and it won't,

11:33.026 --> 11:35.829
you need to tell Ben
that Jane's crashing
at your place tonight.

11:35.863 --> 11:36.329
No one
would believe that.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.899
Her brother will.

11:38.932 --> 11:41.068
And what if someone else
finds out about this?

11:41.101 --> 11:45.873
Me and Jane?
A sleep-over? Seriously?

11:45.906 --> 11:47.841
Do you have any idea
what that sort of thing
would do to me socially?

11:51.044 --> 11:52.479
Not tRight.care.

11:52.512 --> 11:52.913
No. I...

11:59.252 --> 12:00.988
I don't care. I'm sorry.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.859
So, where's she
really going?

12:05.893 --> 12:08.228
I'm not at liberty
to discuss.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.097
I'm your girlfriend,

12:10.130 --> 12:11.865
you're supposed to
tell me everything
no matter what it is.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.100
And I'm your boyfriend,

12:13.133 --> 12:15.168
so it would be
cool if you did me
this one little favor

12:15.202 --> 12:15.836
without asking
a million questions.

12:18.138 --> 12:18.605
Okay, fine.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.740
So, you'll do it?

12:22.075 --> 12:23.076
I'll think about it.

12:30.217 --> 12:34.187
The sting of battle
will only make you stronger.

12:34.221 --> 12:37.324
Do not flinch
at oncoming fire.

12:37.357 --> 12:42.062
Do not hold your position.
Always moving forward.
Always advancing.

12:42.095 --> 12:47.935
The time is now,
and I am proud to
lead you all to victory.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.036
Let's do this!

12:51.939 --> 12:53.907
Okay, people,
shirts and skins.

12:54.574 --> 12:55.909
(ALL MUTTERING)

12:59.012 --> 13:02.082
Right. Bad idea.
Just shirts.

13:02.115 --> 13:02.983
All right,
get on the line.

13:03.016 --> 13:07.020
Let's play
some dodgeball!

13:07.054 --> 13:08.021
Jane, I need you
to put down the
notebook thing,

13:08.055 --> 13:09.222
and get
on the front line.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.959
Oh, I can't.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.593
Sure you can.
This is your game.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.895
I can feel it.
You've got it.

13:14.928 --> 13:17.597
No, I can't
put this down, Ben.
It's very, very important.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.332
And dodgeball isn't?
Go put the notebook down.

13:19.366 --> 13:22.302
It's not a notebook,
it's a Lookbook.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.104
It's work related.
And I cannot
put it down,

13:24.137 --> 13:26.106
not even for a second.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.375
Jane, I want you
I'm not putting it down.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.844
You better do this..

13:30.878 --> 13:33.981
Dude.
You're making me
look really bad here.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.082
I'm sorry. It's just...

13:37.017 --> 13:38.118
I can't put
this down, Ben.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.587
Put the
look-a-whatever-it-is down

13:40.620 --> 13:42.923
and hit the
dodgeball court
right this minute,

13:42.956 --> 13:46.159
or I'm giving you
an F for the day.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.995
An F for the day?
In dodgeball?

13:48.028 --> 13:48.361
Is that even
a real thing?

13:48.395 --> 13:50.230
It is now.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.065
(SIGHS)

13:56.303 --> 13:58.271
Sit this one out, Quimby.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.875
Fine.

14:01.909 --> 14:02.075
All right, let's play
some dodgeball.

14:18.258 --> 14:18.992
HeyHey.ne.

14:22.295 --> 14:27.000
So, your brother's
teaching dodgeball now?

14:30.003 --> 14:32.906
It appears that way.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.177
So how was your date?

14:37.210 --> 14:40.347
Well, she did stay
through the whole thing,

14:40.380 --> 14:42.315
so that part was
an improvement.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.684
Ouch.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.186
How was your date?

14:46.219 --> 14:48.956
I didn't know
you were into older guys.

14:48.989 --> 14:51.324
(LAUGHS) Mine was
definitely not a date.

14:51.358 --> 14:54.194
It was a work dinner
for my internship.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.228
Oh.

14:55.728 --> 14:56.997
It's good to know.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.035
Hey, Fadden!
Break it up over there!

15:02.069 --> 15:03.470
Sorry, Coach.
I was just leaving.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.975
That's what
I'm talking about.
Good job.

15:11.344 --> 15:12.912
Don't want to
get you in trouble.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.335
Hey, Rita Shaw.

15:35.368 --> 15:38.238
Are you going
to that faculty
karaoke thing tonight?

15:38.271 --> 15:40.207
Of course. I'm Asian.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.241
What do you think?

15:41.274 --> 15:43.176
Honestly,
I don't know.

15:45.412 --> 15:49.549
I'm sorry, I was just
thinking that since...

15:51.518 --> 15:53.320
Since what?

15:53.353 --> 15:56.223
Jane is having
this whole friend
sleep-over thing at Lulu's.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.458
I thought that maybe
you and I could
hit the faculty party

15:58.491 --> 16:02.062
and get to
know one another
a little better, and...

16:02.095 --> 16:03.063
Wait.
Back up a sec.

16:03.096 --> 16:05.198
Jane is
having a sleep-over
at Lulu's house?

16:05.232 --> 16:08.135
You actually believe that?

16:08.168 --> 16:10.203
Why wouldn't
I believe that?

16:10.237 --> 16:12.339
I'd be willing to bet
a year of my generous
board of education salary

16:12.372 --> 16:15.442
that Jane isn't sleeping
over at Lulu Pope's.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.344
Where else would
she be sleeping?

16:17.377 --> 16:19.212
I don't know, Ben.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.780
Did you ever stay out
all night when you were
in high school?

16:20.813 --> 16:21.614
Sure.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.151
And what is it
that you were doing?

16:24.184 --> 16:26.419
Well, I don't
wanna brag, but...

16:29.056 --> 16:30.190
Oh, God.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.292
Look. It happens.
Kids grow up.
They get curious.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.295
Curious? No,
Jane's not "curious."

16:35.328 --> 16:37.197
Look, maybe there's
a boy she likes?

16:38.598 --> 16:40.267
Nick Fadden.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.134
Okay, then.
This all makes sense.

16:41.168 --> 16:44.137
Just don't blow it
out of proportion.

16:44.171 --> 16:47.174
Maybe it's time
you and Jane have
"the talk" about...

16:47.207 --> 16:49.109
I have to stop this.

16:59.219 --> 17:04.524
* They say
it's not getting warm again

17:04.557 --> 17:08.495
* Leaves on the ground

17:11.231 --> 17:15.235
* I stand on stairs
to apartments...

17:15.268 --> 17:17.837
Boom!

17:17.870 --> 17:20.340
I can't get over the fact
that I'm stuck here

17:20.373 --> 17:21.374
and you get to
go to Paris tonight.

17:21.408 --> 17:25.345
I know.
Maybe I could
fit you in my carry-on.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.480
But you'd
have to wear those
really skinny jeans.

17:27.514 --> 17:28.181
You know,
the tiny ones?

17:28.215 --> 17:30.049
Ha! Funny.

17:30.650 --> 17:31.884
I just...

17:31.918 --> 17:35.488
I hope getting this
Lookbook to Paris
saves Gray's job.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.324
Did you
talk to Lulu yet?

17:37.357 --> 17:38.591
I did.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.127
And?

17:40.160 --> 17:42.229
She didn't exactly commit,

17:42.262 --> 17:45.365
but she insinuated
an interest in committing.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.600
Why did I have
to say her name?

17:47.634 --> 17:50.103
I mean, it just popped out
and then I couldn't
take it back.

17:50.137 --> 17:52.872
Of all the names
I could've picked
I had to say Lulu?

17:52.905 --> 17:54.507
She's never gonna do it.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.109
I'm working on it.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.481
* Stay with me tonight

18:04.284 --> 18:07.487
* Stay with me

18:09.222 --> 18:11.891
* And I'll keep
holdin' on... *

18:11.924 --> 18:12.759
BEN: Your grip's off.

18:12.792 --> 18:16.229
Yeah, I'm just
messing around, Coach.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.665
Yeah. "Messing around"
is sort of what I wanted
to talk to you about.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.533
Look, I know
my focus hasn't
been perfect lately,

18:21.534 --> 18:22.569
but

18:25.672 --> 18:27.407
I can get the job done.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.542
You know,
you're a teenager.

18:29.576 --> 18:32.279
You should take it slow.
I was a lot like you
in high school,

18:32.312 --> 18:34.447
and I was known to,
let's say,

18:34.481 --> 18:37.450
over-swing on occasion.

18:40.253 --> 18:43.256
When you find yourself
at the plate tonight...

18:43.290 --> 18:44.591
We don't have a game tonight.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.327
Right. But if you
found yourself

18:47.360 --> 18:48.595
for some reason
up Why would I......

18:48.628 --> 18:52.232
Work wOkay.e here.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.633
Fastball,
straight down the middle.
What do you do?

18:53.666 --> 18:55.702
I try to hit it
out of the park.

18:55.735 --> 18:56.469
No, no.
No, you don't.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.638
I No.'t?

18:58.671 --> 19:00.573
Are Not really, Coach.ere?

19:00.607 --> 19:02.342
(SIGHS)
Let's try this again.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.277
Whatever you're
doing tonight,

19:04.311 --> 19:07.280
if you get a fastball
down the middle,
just swing easy.

19:07.314 --> 19:09.382
Very, very easy.
Just lightly tap it.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.584
Don't do that.

19:11.618 --> 19:14.487
If you accidentally
make contact,

19:14.521 --> 19:16.223
first base only.
Nothing more.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.458
Do not try to go
for second base.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.327
Hey. Home run?
Not an option.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.295
You hear me?

19:22.329 --> 19:23.430
Hey, Coach!

19:23.463 --> 19:26.233
Thanks so much
for letting Jane
sleep over tonight.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.341
Everything I just said,

19:34.374 --> 19:35.508
ignore it.

19:36.776 --> 19:37.610
You swing for
the fences, buddy.

19:39.612 --> 19:39.646
Good talk.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.638
Thank you, Billy.
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.640
And I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

20:07.674 --> 20:10.009
but please thank
Lulu for me.

20:10.042 --> 20:13.446
In less than nine hours
I'm going to be on
a plane to Paris.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.783
And hopefully
saving two jobs.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.588
Of course I've heard.
What've you heard?

20:21.621 --> 20:23.490
Nothing. Just...

20:24.457 --> 20:26.526
Look. I spoke to
an old mate from
Parsons last night,

20:26.559 --> 20:28.761
has his finger
on the pulse about
this sort of thing,

20:28.795 --> 20:29.396
if you know
what I mean?

20:29.429 --> 20:31.431
And, well...

20:31.464 --> 20:33.666
Well what?

20:33.700 --> 20:35.001
Come on, enough
with all the fingers
and the pulses.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.303
Diaz is gone.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.304
Yeah.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.572
Gone as in no-longer-
Creative-Director gone?

20:39.606 --> 20:41.040
Gone as in
out-of-the-company gone.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.275
No.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.610
Yes.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.278
And Gray?

20:45.312 --> 20:47.280
It doesn't look good.

20:47.314 --> 20:49.482
But wait, wait.
Who's gonna take over?

20:49.516 --> 20:51.017
No one knows for sure.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.752
No one knows what?

20:52.785 --> 20:55.422
Oh. Hi, Jane!

20:55.455 --> 20:57.790
Hello, Jane!

20:58.691 --> 21:00.427
Hi.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.661
Are you guys
talking about Gray?

21:02.729 --> 21:04.331
I don't know!

21:04.364 --> 21:05.832
Stop pressuring me!
I don't actually
know anything, okay?

21:09.369 --> 21:11.838
He's on
the Master Cleanse.
Very cranky.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.373
Right.

21:15.475 --> 21:18.611
I hate to cut this short
but I have to go.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.582
Can you believe it?

21:22.615 --> 21:25.618
Believe what?

21:25.652 --> 21:27.820
Diaz out. Gray out.
It's like Christmas
came early this year.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.322
Oh, poor Gray.

21:29.356 --> 21:30.857
Oh, I can see you're
really torn up about it.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.425
I mean,
let's be honest.

21:32.459 --> 21:35.728
The timing
couldn't be
better for me.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.730
Everything's going
according to plan.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.799
Plan? What plan?

21:39.832 --> 21:41.468
Nothing.

21:41.501 --> 21:44.103
Just that Gray

21:44.136 --> 21:44.837
and that annoying
little assistant of hers

21:44.871 --> 21:47.540
will finally be
out of my hair.

21:47.574 --> 21:48.841
(SIGHS) I almost
feel sorry for them.

21:52.579 --> 21:53.913
I said "almost."

21:58.585 --> 22:03.356
Passport. Check.
Boarding pass. Check.

22:03.390 --> 22:04.924
And the Lookbook.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.394
Check.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.568
No check.

22:18.638 --> 22:19.806
No. No, no, no.
This is not happening.

22:25.712 --> 22:26.746
It's gone.

22:28.415 --> 22:29.749
The Lookbook is gone.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.607
(PANTING)

23:03.450 --> 23:04.350
Please, pick up.
Please, pick up.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.653
Now very rarely
will you hear someone say,

23:06.686 --> 23:09.722
"The movie was
better than the book."

23:09.756 --> 23:12.525
That's because
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

23:12.559 --> 23:16.829
to fit an entire book
into two hours.

23:16.863 --> 23:17.964
Hey,
I can't talk right now.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.499
I need your help.

23:19.532 --> 23:20.867
I'll call you
right after class.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.802
No, no, no, no.
Billy, please don't hang up.

23:22.835 --> 23:23.736
I'm having
a major meltdown here.

23:23.770 --> 23:26.673
Mr. Nutter.

23:26.706 --> 23:28.741
Hi.
Am I boring you?

23:29.008 --> 23:31.744
Not at all.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.746
Really?
'Cause you seem
a bit distracted.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.982
Maybe it's just because
you're on the phone.
I don't know.

23:36.015 --> 23:37.717
This is not
a good time, Janey.

23:37.750 --> 23:38.851
Billy!

23:38.885 --> 23:40.887
And you're still
not hanging up.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.990
If that is not your mother
or your barber on the line,

23:44.023 --> 23:46.459
I'm gonna need you
to put the phone away.

23:46.493 --> 23:48.595
Somebody to What? e Lookbook.

23:48.628 --> 23:49.762
I said
put the phone away.

23:50.797 --> 23:52.532
It's gone, Billy.
It's gone!

23:53.600 --> 23:55.735
I'm sorry, Mr. Hunter.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.637
Uh, I gotta go.

23:57.670 --> 23:58.571
Oh. No, no, no.
You should stay.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.942
Listen, you can either
sit in your seat now,

24:02.975 --> 24:04.611
or you can
sit in it after school
during detention.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.579
All week.
It's your choice.

24:11.050 --> 24:11.584
Billy,
please don't hang up!

24:14.554 --> 24:15.855
I'll take the detention.

24:21.928 --> 24:24.463
Now that's what we call
a bad decision, gang.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.869
Okay. What happened
to the Lookbook?

24:29.902 --> 24:32.739
I can't believe
I'm actually saying
the word "Lookbook."

24:32.772 --> 24:34.040
Someone stole it.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.808
Why would they do that?

24:35.842 --> 24:38.778
I don't know!
Because they're trying
to get Gray fired.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.947
Because they want her job.

24:42.882 --> 24:45.652
Because of
politics in fashion,

24:45.685 --> 24:47.253
and because the world
is dark and stormy.

24:47.286 --> 24:48.788
Hi.

24:48.821 --> 24:51.724
All I know is that
somebody stole it.

24:54.694 --> 24:54.761
Sorry.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.700
And I think I know who.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.673
Yeah, of course.

25:06.706 --> 25:07.807
We'll celebrate
this weekend.

25:10.577 --> 25:12.679
I'll call you back.

25:12.712 --> 25:15.281
Person.

25:15.314 --> 25:15.782
QuickNope.tion.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.852
You need to what?

25:21.721 --> 25:23.522
I neYes?o...

25:29.929 --> 25:30.930
Uh...

25:35.635 --> 25:36.936
Borrow a pen.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.044
There.
Now I'd appreciate it

25:45.077 --> 25:46.012
if you stopped staring
at me like a psycho

25:46.045 --> 25:49.115
and moved along with
your happy, perky day.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.721
Get out of my office?

25:54.754 --> 25:56.088
You may. The sooner
the better, actually.

25:56.122 --> 25:57.957
Okay.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.002
Yes, Jane?

26:10.036 --> 26:11.638
How's it going?

26:12.772 --> 26:14.707
You tell me.

26:14.741 --> 26:17.677
Wow. That's...
I love that.

26:17.710 --> 26:19.946
Okay, I need you
to do something for me.

26:19.979 --> 26:21.380
And it's probably gonna
sound a little weird.

26:21.413 --> 26:24.817
Anything for you.

26:24.851 --> 26:28.020
I need you to get
India out of her office
for, like, five minutes.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.122
And how do you
propose I do that?

26:30.156 --> 26:31.791
I don't know.
Aren't you two...

26:31.824 --> 26:32.892
With...?

26:32.925 --> 26:34.827
DoBenefits.t.

26:34.861 --> 26:36.162
She's in a terrible
mood today.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.997
She's in a terrible
mood every day.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.132
She just threw
a pen at me.

26:40.166 --> 26:41.768
Not really convincing me.

26:41.801 --> 26:44.003
Um, please?

26:44.036 --> 26:46.038
Are you gonna
help me or not?

26:47.039 --> 26:47.874
(SIGHS)

26:50.176 --> 26:52.111
Hello, there.

26:52.945 --> 26:53.646
I'm busy.

26:53.680 --> 26:54.814
I realize that.
But I wanted to

26:54.847 --> 26:57.917
show you
something in my office
for about five minutes.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.186
"Something in your office"?

27:00.219 --> 27:02.154
I've seen it already
and I'm not really

27:02.188 --> 27:04.423
in the mood for those
five minutes right now.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.659
I assure you
it's strictly work-related.

27:06.693 --> 27:08.094
Wait. Five minutes?

27:08.127 --> 27:10.863
That's just cruel
and completely untrue.

27:10.897 --> 27:12.765
Fine. What is it that
you wanted to show me?

27:12.799 --> 27:12.865
Right this way.

27:17.003 --> 27:19.672
You look ravishing.
I really like this.

27:19.706 --> 27:20.206
It's kind of a new look.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.809
Okay. You know what?

27:22.842 --> 27:24.977
I got a lot going on today
and I'm not feeling that
helpful right now, so...

27:25.011 --> 27:27.714
Please, don't go.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.749
INDIA: Oh, my God.
(CHUCKLES)

27:30.717 --> 27:32.184
You want to
have the talk.

27:32.218 --> 27:35.654
I've withheld
and now you want.

27:35.922 --> 27:39.792
That is just
so guy-like.

27:40.793 --> 27:44.964
That is me.
I am a guy.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.933
Okay.
Cut to the chase, please.

27:46.966 --> 27:48.935
You want to
have the talk,
let's have it. Go.

27:48.968 --> 27:51.838
What I think is that you

27:51.871 --> 27:55.174
are going to love,

27:55.207 --> 27:56.075
really love

27:56.108 --> 27:58.244
the color pattern
in this new design.

27:58.277 --> 28:00.780
It's kind of
a burnished auburn
mixed with

28:00.813 --> 28:04.984
a few other great colors
that, obviously,
I came up with.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.720
And the best bit is
there's a hint of
eggshell.

28:07.754 --> 28:08.888
Just to bring out
the contrast.

28:08.921 --> 28:10.256
(GASPS).

28:10.289 --> 28:11.824
You're right!

28:17.296 --> 28:18.865
I do want to have the talk.

28:18.898 --> 28:22.001
About the state of our

28:22.034 --> 28:23.235
relationship.

28:23.269 --> 28:25.137
I've been avoiding it

28:25.171 --> 28:27.073
and now it's time.

28:27.106 --> 28:32.912
So let's talk about
our relationship, shall we?

28:32.945 --> 28:36.916
Although, perhaps
that's a poor choice
of words. "Relationship."

28:39.318 --> 28:43.823
I knew it.
That little weasel.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.224
JEREMY: I mean,
it's such a loaded word.

28:45.257 --> 28:47.093
Oh.

28:49.328 --> 28:51.030
Let me start over.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.765
In an arrangement
such as ours...

28:52.799 --> 28:54.000
"Arrangement"?

28:54.033 --> 28:56.002
(SCOFFS)
Let me start over.

28:58.838 --> 29:02.541
Two trains
leave at the same time
from opposite stations,

29:02.574 --> 29:05.845
and they meet in the middle.

29:05.878 --> 29:09.048
And that is why
I choose to take cabs
as often as possible

29:09.081 --> 29:11.250
because the
Underground system in
this town is so unreliable.

29:11.283 --> 29:11.851
Am I right?

29:15.822 --> 29:17.957
I'm glad we
cleared this up.
Aren't you?

29:26.032 --> 29:29.535
No one has it.
My life is over.

29:29.568 --> 29:32.138
Literally.
Gray is going to
hunt me down and kill me.

29:32.171 --> 29:35.174
Deep breaths.
Jane, deep breaths.
Okay? Are you with me?

29:36.242 --> 29:37.844
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

29:37.877 --> 29:39.946
Jane? Jane?

29:39.979 --> 29:40.913
Yes. Yes, I'm nodding.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.581
Yeah, I can't see that.

29:42.614 --> 29:46.886
Right. Sorry.
I'm just a little
overwhelmed right now.

29:46.919 --> 29:49.889
Let's think
about this, okay?
It's gotta be somewhere.

29:49.922 --> 29:50.990
Where did you see it last?

29:51.023 --> 29:54.827
In my bag!
Which was on my shoulder
the entire day.

29:54.861 --> 29:55.794
Okay, maybe you
just left it somewhere?

29:55.828 --> 29:57.263
It totally could've
slipped out of your bag.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.999
Is there anywhere
that could have happened?

30:00.032 --> 30:03.870
Oh, maybe here at work,
or at school,

30:03.903 --> 30:06.105
or possibly somewhere
in the city of New York.

30:06.138 --> 30:06.638
Well, that narrows it down.

30:06.672 --> 30:10.076
I'm totally screwed.

30:10.109 --> 30:12.611
No, you're not.
Because we're gonna find it.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.014
You look at work
and I'll look at school.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.382
Everything's gonna
be okay, Janey, I promise.

30:16.415 --> 30:19.151
Okay.

30:19.185 --> 30:20.887
Okay, you're right.

30:23.622 --> 30:27.126
And the cosine is what?

30:28.427 --> 30:30.162
One...

30:30.196 --> 30:31.397
* Hey, hey, hey

30:31.430 --> 30:33.265
* Think you've got problems

30:33.299 --> 30:34.867
* Oh, oh, oh

30:34.901 --> 30:35.601
* More than you know

30:35.634 --> 30:37.870
* Hey, hey, hey

30:37.904 --> 30:38.604
* Do you wanna solve 'em?

30:38.637 --> 30:40.873
* No, no, no

30:40.907 --> 30:41.941
* You just quit and go home

30:41.974 --> 30:44.310
* Nothing is right

30:44.343 --> 30:46.078
* Everything's wrong

30:46.112 --> 30:49.081
* You close your eyes
and start singing

30:49.115 --> 30:51.650
* You don't know the words
but it's your favorite song

30:51.683 --> 30:53.419
* How about one more time
with some feeling?

30:53.452 --> 30:55.654
* Hey, hey, hey

30:55.687 --> 30:56.622
* Think you've got problems

30:56.655 --> 30:58.024
* Oh, oh, oh

30:58.057 --> 30:59.425
* More than you know

30:59.458 --> 31:00.659
* Hey, hey, hey

31:00.692 --> 31:03.095
* Do you wanna solve 'em

31:03.129 --> 31:04.296
* No, no, no

31:04.330 --> 31:06.332
* You just quit and go home

31:07.699 --> 31:09.401
This is a good look for you.

31:09.435 --> 31:10.069
I like you on your knees.

31:11.003 --> 31:13.439
What are you doing?

31:13.472 --> 31:16.308
I lost a contact lens.

31:17.109 --> 31:18.344
Is that so?

31:19.111 --> 31:20.012
Sort of.

31:22.081 --> 31:26.118
Oh! Wow!
Would you look at that?

31:26.152 --> 31:28.220
I just found it.
What a relief.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.491
Oh, God.

31:35.094 --> 31:36.162
ThanDon't touch me.cern.

31:42.368 --> 31:45.437
Jane.

31:45.471 --> 31:47.139
Jane, I think you've
looked everywhere.

31:48.474 --> 31:49.075
I know.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.681
I lost it.

31:55.714 --> 31:57.349
And the worst part
is I let Gray down

31:57.383 --> 31:58.150
when she
needed me the most.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.254
What's this?

32:02.288 --> 32:03.122
Choos always
make it better, honey.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.995
It's not working.

32:25.377 --> 32:27.246
Mmm. Billy?

32:27.279 --> 32:28.981
Carter?

32:29.015 --> 32:30.116
Yeah, you're gonna want
some caffeine for this.

32:30.149 --> 32:33.052
She hasn't
completed a sentence
for over an hour,

32:33.085 --> 32:34.253
just kept pointing at
your name in her phone.

32:35.221 --> 32:36.422
Where is she?

32:42.028 --> 32:43.295
(SCOFFS)

32:43.329 --> 32:46.298
Wow.
This is quite a sight.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.400
Don't judge me.

32:48.434 --> 32:49.268
I just want to lie here,
surrounded by

32:49.301 --> 32:53.772
pretty clothes and Choos
until I'm fired.

32:53.805 --> 32:56.742
My last moments
of semi-happiness.

32:56.775 --> 32:59.111
You realize,
I'm gonna feel guilty
for the rest of my life

32:59.145 --> 33:00.546
about getting Gray fired.

33:00.579 --> 33:03.249
You didn't get
her fired. Yet.

33:03.282 --> 33:05.017
We're gonna find it, Jane.

33:05.051 --> 33:07.553
How? The plane
leaves in a few hours.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.488
I've looked here.
You've looked at school.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.357
It's gone.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.225
And I'm the one
that lost it.

33:13.259 --> 33:15.261
Okay. Come on.
Now, think.

33:15.294 --> 33:16.128
Were you
anywhere else at all?

33:18.064 --> 33:18.330
Anywhere?

33:18.364 --> 33:20.599
Nowhere.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.334
Except

33:22.368 --> 33:22.468
a cab.

33:34.213 --> 33:35.447
This should be easy.

33:42.488 --> 33:44.323
* It's way too hot for me

33:44.356 --> 33:45.791
* Out on the street

33:45.824 --> 33:48.460
* There's gotta be some way
to beat the heat

33:48.494 --> 33:49.561
* It's getting worse and worse

33:49.595 --> 33:53.265
* So just leave 'em be
The shadows on the wall

33:53.299 --> 33:54.500
* Out to get me

33:54.533 --> 33:56.235
* Ain't got no one

33:56.268 --> 33:58.170
* And ain't got
nothing to prove

34:00.239 --> 34:02.241
* You tell me I'm no good

34:02.274 --> 34:03.309
* Well, tell me something new

34:03.342 --> 34:05.244
* I've heard it all before

34:05.277 --> 34:06.378
* What you gonna do

34:06.412 --> 34:08.080
* You never seem to hear

34:08.114 --> 34:10.482
* A single word I say

34:10.516 --> 34:12.184
I already checked it.

34:12.218 --> 34:13.585
* Ain't got no one

34:13.619 --> 34:18.090
* And ain't got
nothing to prove

34:18.124 --> 34:19.625
* 'Cause when you
ain't got nothing

34:19.658 --> 34:22.194
* You ain't got
nothing to lose

34:22.228 --> 34:25.197
* Ain't got nothing to lose

we couldn't find it.

You're not the only one.

34:48.587 --> 34:51.190
So, what happens now?

34:51.223 --> 34:55.261
I guess I call Gray
and I tell her I lost it.

34:57.196 --> 35:00.599
And I hope against hope
that she...

35:00.632 --> 35:02.601
We get to keep our jobs.

35:03.169 --> 35:05.637
I'm really sorry, Janey.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.439
It's okay.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.641
It's just...

35:09.675 --> 35:11.543

about how hard
it's gonna be

35:11.577 --> 35:14.180
to get back to the place
where I am right now...

35:19.251 --> 35:20.486
You're here with me.

35:22.188 --> 35:24.556
That's what matters.

Paris?

No, I don't know what
you're talking about.

36:02.528 --> 36:03.629
Save it.

36:04.230 --> 36:06.498
Fine. You won.

36:07.699 --> 36:09.535
Yes, you won.

36:09.568 --> 36:12.438
So, you can spare me
the crazy, creepy speech

36:12.471 --> 36:14.473
about how Gray's
on her way out,

36:14.506 --> 36:16.675
and how I'm on
my way out with her.

36:16.708 --> 36:18.244
That's not why I'm here.

36:18.977 --> 36:19.945
Nope.

36:19.978 --> 36:23.615
I came to give you this.

36:24.516 --> 36:24.850
It was you.

36:24.883 --> 36:27.486
It wasn't.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.355
Trust me, I don't
need to steal Gray's
Lookbook to get ahead.

36:29.388 --> 36:32.791
A taxi driver returned it
to the front desk
about an hour ago.

36:35.427 --> 36:38.397
You must have been
beside yourself.

36:38.430 --> 36:40.799
I've been a little
concerned. Yes.

36:45.304 --> 36:46.605
I don't know what to say.

36:46.638 --> 36:47.172
Thank you, India.

36:47.205 --> 36:51.243
Right. Sorry. Thank you.

36:51.277 --> 36:53.679
It's just...
I'm a little confused.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.714
Not that I'm complaining.
It's just...

36:55.747 --> 36:58.484
You don't even like me.
So why help?

36:58.517 --> 37:00.752
Because that Lookbook...

37:00.786 --> 37:02.288
It's not
gonna save you.

37:03.822 --> 37:05.391
Or Gray.

Never went to sleep.
Come on, let's go.

drive me to Queens.

Yeah, well,
maybe just a driver.

38:24.870 --> 38:26.438
Come on.
It's gonna be fun.

38:26.472 --> 38:29.375

our last road trip?

38:29.408 --> 38:30.308

sarcasm coming from?

on our last road trip.

you were gonna steal
that beer before we went in.

You never
tell the decoy
he's the decoy.

38:43.589 --> 38:45.624

Just leave me out
of this one, Tommy.

getting sent away.
