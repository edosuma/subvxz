WEBVTT

01:06.006 --> 01:07.475
What's wrong with him?

01:09.310 --> 01:10.478
Get off me!

01:10.512 --> 01:11.412
Get off me!

01:12.146 --> 01:14.714
- You got nowhere to go now.
- Get off me!

01:17.251 --> 01:19.752
Why don't you
just tell me, huh?

01:19.785 --> 01:21.522
Who put you up to it?

01:21.555 --> 01:23.055
Was it the Shipes?

04:55.131 --> 04:56.766
It doesn't really matter.

05:01.036 --> 05:02.772
Your father was a fuck-up.

05:08.411 --> 05:10.213
They don't hold
that against you.

05:14.483 --> 05:15.883
But it will come up.

05:17.952 --> 05:20.422
You are what people
know a Shipe to be.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.158
Someone in control.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.395
Someone they can trust.

05:29.398 --> 05:31.199
And someone who
looks after them.

05:49.718 --> 05:51.820
If you wanna marry her,

05:53.255 --> 05:55.690
you'll have to show that
you're part of the family.

05:57.225 --> 05:58.293
Well, I do, sir.

05:59.127 --> 06:00.461
It would be an honor.

06:00.494 --> 06:05.166
This war, when it's
all over, we will win.

06:06.534 --> 06:10.970
The Shipes will win, no matter
what side is the victor.

06:17.478 --> 06:18.945
You will marry my daughter.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.149
You will run this
country with us.

08:18.096 --> 08:19.097
Mr. Shipe.

08:20.599 --> 08:22.267
What are
you doin' in town?

08:22.301 --> 08:23.868
Come back
in town for a while.

08:23.901 --> 08:25.136
Your grandfather,

08:25.169 --> 08:26.837
best governor this
state's ever had.

08:28.272 --> 08:29.407
Nice to be home.

08:29.440 --> 08:30.508
Welcome home, Will.

08:31.642 --> 08:33.544
Does your mother
need anything?

08:33.578 --> 08:34.779
A pack of smokes?

08:34.812 --> 08:35.613
Yeah.

08:42.953 --> 08:44.989
You
know he went mad.

08:45.022 --> 08:47.558
Mom's a pill-popper, shut in.

08:47.592 --> 08:49.393
We let 'em take what they need,

08:49.427 --> 08:51.562
bread and butter, lemonade.

08:53.331 --> 08:55.533
Nick and I were best
friends when we were kids.

08:55.566 --> 08:57.001
Before I went away to school.

08:58.369 --> 09:01.073
He had something
in his hands earlier today.

09:03.674 --> 09:05.176
An ax or something.

09:05.209 --> 09:07.211
Oh yeah, he
was working at your factory.

09:07.244 --> 09:09.614
Got into a nasty
fight with the boys.

09:09.647 --> 09:11.982
They were making
fun of his visions.

09:12.015 --> 09:13.183
Visions?

09:13.216 --> 09:14.117
Yeah,
he was digging all

09:14.150 --> 09:15.285
around the field this summer.

09:15.318 --> 09:17.120
Something buried in town.

09:17.153 --> 09:18.455
MAN IN LEATHER
JACKET: Something big.

09:18.488 --> 09:20.023
Gold or some shit.

09:20.056 --> 09:21.758
Only
one talks to him now

09:21.791 --> 09:23.393
is his Momma and Mary.

09:30.467 --> 09:31.968
I gave him a lottery ticket.

09:33.503 --> 09:35.072
He never even scratched it.

09:35.106 --> 09:37.007
Found it lying out
here on the ground.

10:19.615 --> 10:20.449
Hello.

10:25.821 --> 10:26.655
Is Nick here?

10:27.823 --> 10:28.724
It's Will Shipe.

10:34.897 --> 10:35.998
He's with Mary.

10:39.069 --> 10:39.868
Where?

10:41.603 --> 10:43.005
At the water.

10:52.513 --> 10:55.049
You need anything Ms. Taylor?

10:59.154 --> 10:59.954
Money.

11:23.945 --> 11:26.781
You have a good
day, Ms. Taylor.

14:06.970 --> 14:08.505
Hey.

14:08.538 --> 14:09.374
Hey.

14:12.576 --> 14:13.944
William Shipe.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.480
I'm back in town now.

14:19.217 --> 14:21.219
What's this I hear,
you diggin' for gold?

14:24.155 --> 14:24.988
Treason.

14:26.190 --> 14:27.591
Dead men, you know.

14:27.624 --> 14:29.327
All of it right here.

14:36.334 --> 14:37.235
How's Mary been?

14:44.142 --> 14:45.442
She's with God now.

14:50.646 --> 14:52.249
Is her
brother still in town?

14:55.051 --> 14:55.885
Shot himself.

15:00.856 --> 15:02.558
You take care
of yourself, Nick.

16:13.628 --> 16:16.132
What is it that will be taken?

16:17.632 --> 16:20.869
What's in the trunk
will help us win the war.

16:20.902 --> 16:22.405
Who's it goin' to?

16:22.438 --> 16:26.408
When the Confederacy is
victorious, with our help,

16:29.144 --> 16:30.811
we will have a
seat at the table.

16:33.448 --> 16:35.517
There'll be the three of us.

16:35.549 --> 16:37.785
We will trade off carrying it

16:37.818 --> 16:39.154
while the other one in the front

16:39.187 --> 16:40.687
will have the map and the gun.

17:46.420 --> 17:47.620
Hey,
Will, how you doin'?

17:47.653 --> 17:49.021
I haven't seen you in a while.

17:49.056 --> 17:50.524
I'm good, Ms.
Linda, how are you?

17:50.557 --> 17:52.559
Good, good, nice

17:52.593 --> 17:54.727
- Nice to be back.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.230

17:57.730 --> 17:58.831

17:58.865 --> 18:00.366

18:00.399 --> 18:01.367
- It's good to see you too.
- How long you in town for?

18:01.400 --> 18:03.001
No, you're welcome.

18:03.034 --> 18:04.870
- Undecided.
- I got that beer.

18:04.903 --> 18:06.372
Can I have some shots
for the bar too?

18:06.405 --> 18:07.939
Oh, no, please, please,
please let me do it.

18:07.973 --> 18:09.142
What would you like?

18:09.175 --> 18:10.610
- Whiskey today?
- Whiskey's good.

18:10.642 --> 18:12.211
Whiskey's good?

18:12.245 --> 18:13.412
Yeah.

18:13.446 --> 18:14.147
- Whiskey's good, I guess.
- Absolutely, good.

18:21.254 --> 18:22.488
You gotta be gentle on me.

18:22.522 --> 18:23.788
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:23.822 --> 18:26.725
That's why I'm giving
you the break.

18:26.758 --> 18:28.294
I'm breakin'.

18:28.327 --> 18:29.428
All right, here we go.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.383
How's everything at
the factory, good?

18:51.416 --> 18:52.651
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:52.683 --> 18:54.885
- Yeah?
- You know how it goes.

18:54.919 --> 18:58.123
Gettin' old, body's
breakin' down.

18:58.156 --> 18:59.491
Yeah?

18:59.524 --> 19:00.791
How are them knees?

19:00.824 --> 19:02.726
Rough man, rough.

19:03.662 --> 19:04.695
Let's try this one.

19:07.798 --> 19:08.799
Whoo, there you go.

19:08.832 --> 19:10.034
All right.

19:10.068 --> 19:12.204
You might get one
on the old man today.

19:12.237 --> 19:13.672
All right, let's go.

19:14.905 --> 19:15.806
Cheers, I got a beer
and a shot here.

19:15.839 --> 19:16.907
Yeah.

19:18.643 --> 19:21.079
- You gotta love it.
- There ya go, there ya go.

19:26.850 --> 19:29.154
Get another beer in you,
you'll float it out.

19:31.156 --> 19:32.823
Hey, Will, you
having a good time?

19:32.856 --> 19:33.658
Yes.

19:33.692 --> 19:35.392
So let's do shots.

19:35.426 --> 19:37.127
And she needs a
refill so can we?

19:37.161 --> 19:38.329
Yup.

19:38.362 --> 19:39.163
Are you
good down there?

19:39.196 --> 19:40.698
There we go.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.500
Linda, take
it out of there.

19:43.534 --> 19:44.934
Shame about your father.

19:45.835 --> 19:47.204
Excuse me?

19:47.238 --> 19:48.639
- Shame about your father?
- Excuse me?

19:48.672 --> 19:50.006
Will, Will, Willy,
Willy, it's okay.

19:50.039 --> 19:51.408
Linda, Linda, Linda.

21:11.286 --> 21:12.220
Let's fight man.

21:12.254 --> 21:14.589
Huh?

23:40.466 --> 23:41.300
Hello.

23:44.736 --> 23:45.637
How was town?

23:47.038 --> 23:47.873
It was fine.

23:50.209 --> 23:51.477
You remember Nick Taylor?

23:54.179 --> 23:55.280
There's a nut job.

23:57.683 --> 23:58.784
Hmm.

23:58.817 --> 24:00.017
Yeah.

24:00.052 --> 24:03.188
He's all cracked
up, Ms. Taylor too.

24:06.023 --> 24:08.460
The whole town's cracked up.

24:09.895 --> 24:11.563
Yeah, he's really lost it.

24:11.597 --> 24:14.066
He's out diggin' for gold.

24:16.502 --> 24:17.569
Digging for gold?

24:21.005 --> 24:23.407
Says he's having
visions about the war.

24:25.877 --> 24:27.043
Poor kid.

24:35.386 --> 24:37.488
There's gotta
be something buried.

24:39.690 --> 24:40.758
Lots of things.

24:42.093 --> 24:44.695
Like
what, do you think?

24:44.729 --> 24:45.796
Skeletons.

24:47.565 --> 24:48.466
Weapons.

24:50.101 --> 24:50.968
Secrets.

25:01.979 --> 25:03.414
You know where that gold is?

25:05.349 --> 25:06.817
I know that Nick
would be better off

25:06.851 --> 25:08.753
paying attention
to his sick mother.

25:14.257 --> 25:15.125
Yeah.

25:16.660 --> 25:18.194
Maybe that's why he's diggin'.

25:20.597 --> 25:21.765
So he doesn't have to.

26:02.671 --> 26:06.008
And whatever
it was is buried

26:09.111 --> 26:10.112
in the land.

27:05.667 --> 27:08.870
So why don't you just
tell me what you're up to?

27:21.416 --> 27:22.250
Hi, Will.

27:26.121 --> 27:28.756
I don't know if you remember me.

27:28.790 --> 27:32.260
I'm Mary Burke, Nick's cousin.

27:32.293 --> 27:33.695
I remember you.

27:34.861 --> 27:36.530
I just wanted to
say welcome home

27:36.563 --> 27:38.932
and if you need anything.

27:38.965 --> 27:40.667
Thank you, that's very kind.

27:46.740 --> 27:49.710
Momma, this is Nick
Taylor's cousin, Mary.

27:49.743 --> 27:50.877
Hello, Mary.

27:53.513 --> 27:56.550
I also wanted to thank you
for your help with Nick's Mom.

27:58.251 --> 27:59.319
He's an old friend.

28:02.222 --> 28:04.158
Would you wanna
take a walk with me?

28:06.460 --> 28:08.962
I'm gonna go for a walk,
do you need anything?

28:08.995 --> 28:10.064
No, I'm fine.

28:11.132 --> 28:12.466
Don't stay out too late.

28:17.105 --> 28:19.539
The devil gets up around now.

28:27.646 --> 28:29.882
How long you been going
out on the water like that?

28:30.883 --> 28:32.852
You been spying on me?

28:32.885 --> 28:33.719
Guilty.

28:36.255 --> 28:38.091
I've been going
for a little while.

28:38.125 --> 28:39.725
There were a few
years where I didn't.

28:40.659 --> 28:42.162
It's like a Christian thing?

28:43.963 --> 28:44.797
Kind of.

28:46.899 --> 28:48.901
I don't remember
that growing up here.

28:50.070 --> 28:52.172
Well, you haven't
made it home much.

28:52.205 --> 28:53.038
Yeah.

28:54.040 --> 28:55.474
Just been travelin' a lot.

29:08.420 --> 29:11.356
So why'd you come home now?

29:11.389 --> 29:12.423
I was, um.

29:13.858 --> 29:17.295
My Mom says I was living too
fast up there in the city.

29:22.667 --> 29:23.501
She was right.

29:35.047 --> 29:37.549
You gonna abandon me?

30:39.143 --> 30:40.611
I miss these bells.

30:50.019 --> 30:50.820
Nick?

31:02.165 --> 31:05.135
I'm gonna
kick this door down!

31:07.304 --> 31:08.138
Come on.

31:09.672 --> 31:10.673
Come on, Mom.

31:12.408 --> 31:13.243
Get up.

31:14.777 --> 31:15.778
Get up!

31:16.979 --> 31:18.382
Hey!

31:18.414 --> 31:20.384
Come on, get up!

31:20.416 --> 31:21.951
Get up!

31:21.984 --> 31:23.886
Get up!

31:23.920 --> 31:24.754
Damn it.

31:29.458 --> 31:30.626
Anne?

31:34.529 --> 31:36.265
Will Shipe is here.

31:36.299 --> 31:37.565
I don't give a fuck.

31:37.599 --> 31:39.034
Get the fuck out here!

31:39.068 --> 31:41.237
- Get the fuck out here!
- Hey, hey.

31:41.270 --> 31:42.570
You're okay!

31:42.604 --> 31:43.905
You're o...

31:43.939 --> 31:45.607
She's, she's okay.

32:04.327 --> 32:05.460
Would you come
out just so I could

32:05.493 --> 32:06.795
see that you're all right?

32:36.824 --> 32:37.825
You're okay.

36:06.397 --> 36:08.365
Oh, did you go to
the bar last night?

36:08.399 --> 36:11.834
No, I just got into a
bottle with some old friends.

36:14.572 --> 36:15.838
Had a little adventure.

36:21.412 --> 36:23.079
I like adventures.

36:28.418 --> 36:29.485
I get some Tylenol?

36:33.523 --> 36:34.357
That's on me.

36:35.458 --> 36:36.492
Got something stronger
if you need it.

36:36.526 --> 36:37.926
Good to know.

37:37.619 --> 37:40.422
- Come on now, that was...
- Leave him, just leave it.

37:40.455 --> 37:42.224
He's nothin'!

37:55.836 --> 37:57.606
You're
uncle says hello.

38:00.474 --> 38:01.609
Oh yeah?

38:01.642 --> 38:02.510
How's he doin'?

38:04.512 --> 38:05.479
Where's he livin'?

38:13.054 --> 38:13.887
Mm-hmm.

38:16.856 --> 38:17.725
Look at you.

38:20.628 --> 38:23.030
You're too old for this shit!

38:26.167 --> 38:28.235
You're back one day

38:29.637 --> 38:32.106
and you're already hanging
out with those idiots!

38:37.678 --> 38:40.914
I want you to get an
apartment downtown.

38:45.685 --> 38:46.885
Soon.

38:46.919 --> 38:49.322
Sooner the better.

40:09.835 --> 40:10.803
Hey, Jessie, how you doin'?

40:10.836 --> 40:11.804
Good.

40:11.837 --> 40:14.640
I'm just gonna
grab that table.

40:14.673 --> 40:16.108
Will.

40:16.141 --> 40:16.974
Hey.

40:18.310 --> 40:20.078
- Hey, John.
- What's goin' on?

40:20.112 --> 40:21.079
How are ya, Tom?

40:22.713 --> 40:24.014
Heard you were in China.

40:25.183 --> 40:27.552
Yeah, yeah, I was
there for a while.

40:27.585 --> 40:28.920
Food's not as good
as home though.

40:28.952 --> 40:30.954
- I know, Bonnie's soup, shoo!
- Mm mm.

40:32.390 --> 40:35.359
Hey, I heard the women
over there love Americans.

40:35.393 --> 40:37.028
You clean up over there.

40:37.061 --> 40:38.162
Don't tell him that.

40:39.230 --> 40:40.765
Gotta travel more.

40:40.798 --> 40:41.899
Travel?

40:41.933 --> 40:43.034
- Yeah.
- Your broke ass?

40:46.404 --> 40:47.572
Would you like to join us?

40:47.605 --> 40:49.140
Thank you, no, that's
very kind of you,

40:49.173 --> 40:51.142
but I'm just gonna grab
the corner table over there

40:51.175 --> 40:52.877
and just catch up
on some reading.

40:52.910 --> 40:55.346
But I'm here for a while
so we've got plenty

40:55.379 --> 40:56.347
of time to catch up.

40:57.482 --> 40:58.749
Good.

40:58.783 --> 41:00.918
Well, someone's gotta
steer the ship, right?

41:03.921 --> 41:05.590
How is everything
at the plant?

41:07.291 --> 41:09.527
- Okay.
- Yeah, all good.

41:09.559 --> 41:11.328
Aside from Nick
Taylor goin' crazy.

41:12.529 --> 41:15.131
Yeah, he tried to
fight half the guys.

41:15.165 --> 41:17.934
I broke it up, he cracked me
in the eye a couple times.

41:17.968 --> 41:18.869
- Did he?
- Yeah.

41:20.170 --> 41:21.371
I had to make an
example out of him.

41:21.404 --> 41:22.706
I mean, I had to fire him.

41:22.739 --> 41:24.107
I didn't wanna do it.

41:28.144 --> 41:30.180
Hey, have a good one.

41:30.213 --> 41:32.682
We'll make sure things are
running on time at the plant.

41:33.683 --> 41:35.252
Good man.

41:35.285 --> 41:36.753
It's great to see you two.

41:36.786 --> 41:38.722
If you need anything, you
just let me know, all right?

41:45.262 --> 41:46.029
Looking good, ain't he?

41:46.062 --> 41:47.230
Yeah, he is.

41:47.264 --> 41:48.064
That's what
money does for you.

42:51.960 --> 42:53.528
Hey.

42:53.561 --> 42:55.496
You didn't wanna join?

42:55.530 --> 42:56.531
One of these days.

42:58.533 --> 42:59.767
You wanna walk me home?

43:02.003 --> 43:02.737
Of course.

43:23.157 --> 43:26.361
I was married when I was 18.

43:26.394 --> 43:28.030
I lived with him
for a few years.

43:29.130 --> 43:30.431
Who were you married to?

43:32.467 --> 43:33.500
Jason Ridgely.

43:34.735 --> 43:35.702
Jason Ridgely?

43:35.736 --> 43:37.704
Broomstick Jason Ridgely?

43:37.738 --> 43:38.639
He was a.

43:38.672 --> 43:42.609
No, he was fun.

43:42.643 --> 43:44.078
He still in town?

43:44.112 --> 43:45.046
No, he's in jail.

43:57.324 --> 43:58.458
Come on now, Dunkus.

44:00.193 --> 44:01.628
Come on!

44:01.662 --> 44:02.863
They normally this shy?

44:02.896 --> 44:05.265
Yeah, little bit.

44:05.298 --> 44:07.701
They just don't know you yet.

44:10.771 --> 44:12.973
Lloyd's following you
though, you see him?

44:13.006 --> 44:14.775
Lloyd's the tiny one.

44:27.753 --> 44:28.621
I have more.

44:28.654 --> 44:29.755
I got more.

44:29.789 --> 44:31.624
They can tell.

44:31.657 --> 44:33.292
Don't eat my finger.

44:34.593 --> 44:38.197
More?

44:44.837 --> 44:46.005
Here.

44:48.708 --> 44:49.709
Hold on now.

44:51.944 --> 44:53.679
Easy, that's my hand.

44:57.249 --> 44:58.751
Oh, here you go.

46:13.824 --> 46:15.126
I'm here.

46:15.160 --> 46:16.760
Get outta the way, lady!

46:16.794 --> 46:17.828
I'm gonna hit ya!

46:17.861 --> 46:19.030
You can't go any further.

46:19.063 --> 46:21.032
Get outta the way!

46:21.065 --> 46:23.333
You're on the wrong side!

50:28.640 --> 50:33.179
You have to
get Nick to stop digging.

50:33.212 --> 50:34.546
To stop digging.

50:56.967 --> 50:57.768
Help me.

50:59.171 --> 51:01.572
You know us.

51:02.940 --> 51:03.741
Help me.

51:52.889 --> 51:54.191
What?

51:54.225 --> 51:55.025
What's wrong?

51:55.059 --> 51:57.361
What are you doin'?

51:57.394 --> 51:58.195
You tell me.

51:58.229 --> 51:59.029
Tell you what?

52:01.664 --> 52:03.134
Where were you yesterday?

52:05.302 --> 52:06.703
What do you mean?

52:06.736 --> 52:09.540
I saw you walk into this
house in the middle of the night

52:09.573 --> 52:11.342
and you left the door wide open.

52:15.045 --> 52:18.382
You're crazy.

52:20.050 --> 52:21.451
Were you with Mary?

53:12.201 --> 53:13.535
Hi, Ma'am.

53:13.569 --> 53:14.902
Can I take your order?

53:14.936 --> 53:18.207
Yes, hot tea,
toast, and no butter.

53:18.240 --> 53:19.341
Yes, Ma'am.

53:24.613 --> 53:25.746
Bunny.

53:26.948 --> 53:28.816
Well,
hello, young lady.

53:30.018 --> 53:30.918
Oh, you're just saying that so

53:30.952 --> 53:32.853
that you can be young too.

53:32.887 --> 53:33.721
Yeah.

53:35.390 --> 53:37.959
You know we were young
women once upon a time.

53:39.061 --> 53:40.696
Now we're just wise.

53:44.566 --> 53:47.169
I saw you knocking
on Mary's door.

53:48.370 --> 53:49.271
Something wrong?

53:51.240 --> 53:53.242
Oh, you know me so well.

54:00.281 --> 54:02.383
What do you know about her?

54:06.087 --> 54:08.755
They say she practices
witchcraft with those women.

54:09.923 --> 54:11.325
They're looking
for others to come

54:11.359 --> 54:14.228
with them down to the water,
saying it's Christian.

54:21.669 --> 54:23.571
She'll be home in a few hours.

56:08.173 --> 56:09.675
Ladies.

56:09.708 --> 56:11.377
I hope your families are well.

56:13.145 --> 56:15.614
Mary, a word, please.

56:18.150 --> 56:20.951
You know, Will is so very busy.

56:22.253 --> 56:25.423
I think you should let
him focus on his work.

56:25.456 --> 56:27.358
I think he can
do what he wants.

56:27.392 --> 56:30.194
Aren't we reckless.

56:33.831 --> 56:38.102
Your family should have been
written off 100 years ago.

56:41.439 --> 56:43.141
You're standing
on the edge, dear.

57:32.122 --> 57:36.493
Oh, I forgot how long
it takes to get to the city.

57:38.295 --> 57:39.962
Thank you, for helping him.

57:39.995 --> 57:40.996
Yeah.

57:46.570 --> 57:48.572
I spoke with Mary today.

57:51.908 --> 57:52.776
About what?

57:56.745 --> 57:59.815
You know our family
has a long history.

58:02.785 --> 58:06.021
Yeah, and I assume like
everybody else no one is perfect.

58:06.055 --> 58:07.056
Well, exactly,

58:08.290 --> 58:10.159
that's why it's only polite not

58:10.192 --> 58:13.229
to mention the less
fortunate moments.

58:51.866 --> 58:55.937
You know, I remember
when Nick and I were kids,

58:58.840 --> 59:03.144
and we used to play football
down at the high school field

59:03.177 --> 59:05.146
with some of the older kids.

59:05.179 --> 59:10.184
And this one day this ball
just floated in slow motion,

59:12.320 --> 59:14.389
and I reached up
and I grabbed it,

59:15.356 --> 59:18.293
and I brought it in real close.

59:18.326 --> 59:22.330
And I remember spinning
around and I just got, pooh!

59:22.363 --> 59:23.598
Hit by Nick.

59:24.832 --> 59:26.968
Tackling me right to the ground,

59:27.002 --> 59:28.603
and knocked the wind outta me.

59:28.636 --> 59:31.406
And I just remember
looking up at him,

59:31.439 --> 59:36.276
and he was staring down at
me with tears in his eyes.

59:39.212 --> 59:43.517
And that was one of my last
memories of being a kid here.

59:50.424 --> 59:52.225
What is it that
Nick is digging for?

59:55.529 --> 59:56.530
I don't know.

01:00:00.734 --> 01:00:02.936
When I heard that you
were coming back home,

01:00:04.771 --> 01:00:07.574
I started having these visions.

01:00:10.444 --> 01:00:12.080
Like the one's Nick's having?

01:00:13.547 --> 01:00:18.285
They were too much for me so
I prayed that they'd go away.

01:00:20.054 --> 01:00:20.886
And they did.

01:00:23.255 --> 01:00:26.158
And that's when Nick
started having them.

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:28.928
The same ones?

01:00:28.961 --> 01:00:31.064
Yes, the soldiers, the gold.

01:00:33.733 --> 01:00:35.368
Nick's goin' crazy 'cause of me.

01:00:36.202 --> 01:00:37.303
'Cause of my thoughts.

01:00:41.707 --> 01:00:43.376
Haven't told
anyone about them?

01:00:43.409 --> 01:00:44.477
Just Natalie.

01:00:46.178 --> 01:00:47.346
And what does she say?

01:00:48.781 --> 01:00:49.582
To pray.

01:00:55.788 --> 01:00:56.589
I just...

01:00:58.324 --> 01:01:02.062
Need to know what happened.

01:01:03.929 --> 01:01:05.264
What happened?

01:01:06.966 --> 01:01:07.800
To who?

01:01:09.868 --> 01:01:10.702
To me.

01:01:15.107 --> 01:01:16.207
Here, come on.

01:03:11.255 --> 01:03:12.355
I spoke with Mary.

01:03:15.058 --> 01:03:16.759
She's just having these...

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:20.230
Thoughts.

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:22.765
Thoughts.

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:23.633
About what?

01:03:26.203 --> 01:03:27.070
Like Nick.

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:29.672
On the war.

01:03:31.175 --> 01:03:32.841
Soldiers and gold.

01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:40.482
Will, I don't know
what he's going to find,

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:46.255
but their family and
ours have history.

01:04:44.279 --> 01:04:45.779
Nick, can you do me a favor?

01:04:53.721 --> 01:04:55.023
Can you stop digging
for whatever it is

01:04:55.056 --> 01:04:56.324
that you're looking for?

01:05:00.295 --> 01:05:01.263
I can't do that.

01:05:05.566 --> 01:05:06.400
Why not?

01:05:11.071 --> 01:05:12.172
Too important.

01:05:15.975 --> 01:05:17.211
Well, I could pay you.

01:05:19.079 --> 01:05:19.913
Nah.

01:05:21.447 --> 01:05:22.548
It don't matter.

01:05:24.385 --> 01:05:25.485
What doesn't matter?

01:05:26.753 --> 01:05:29.323
I can't stop,
even if I wanted to.

01:05:36.363 --> 01:05:37.630
I don't understand.

01:05:44.138 --> 01:05:45.372
I don't have a choice.

01:06:00.719 --> 01:06:03.289
I don't think he'd do it
for any amount of money.

01:06:06.959 --> 01:06:07.960
He's crazy.

01:06:11.431 --> 01:06:13.333
Just let him dig.

01:06:13.366 --> 01:06:14.733
He's not gonna find anything.

01:06:14.766 --> 01:06:17.936
I was told this many
years ago by Aunt Helen.

01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:19.439
One of her premonitions?

01:06:23.976 --> 01:06:25.411
What did she say?

01:06:27.913 --> 01:06:32.051
She came to my door in the
middle of a lightning storm,

01:06:32.085 --> 01:06:36.521
opened it, and then
fell flat at my feet.

01:06:39.258 --> 01:06:41.893
She said when the
storm approached,

01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:45.097
that she felt sick
and started to vomit,

01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:48.966
and found herself on the
ground on her front lawn,

01:06:49.001 --> 01:06:51.969
and with all the thunder and
lightning crashing around her,

01:06:53.238 --> 01:06:54.905
she thought she
was going to die.

01:06:57.442 --> 01:07:01.612
She said she knew our
family had done something,

01:07:04.016 --> 01:07:05.583
and that some day
someone was going

01:07:05.616 --> 01:07:07.785
to come and try to correct it.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.958
And whatever it was,
is buried in the land.

01:07:20.298 --> 01:07:21.500
So what?

01:07:23.435 --> 01:07:26.804
Let them find it, whatever
it is, it doesn't matter now.

01:07:26.837 --> 01:07:29.774
Will, all anybody
has is their name.

01:07:29.807 --> 01:07:30.908
You know that.

01:07:32.976 --> 01:07:37.081
Your father tried to take
that away from us, from you.

01:07:38.315 --> 01:07:40.583
Tried to make me a fool.

01:07:42.685 --> 01:07:46.656
But I will protect it,
and I will protect you.

01:07:46.689 --> 01:07:47.491
I know that Dad was...

01:07:47.525 --> 01:07:49.326
Oh, fuck that man!

01:07:56.434 --> 01:07:57.268
And she.

01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:02.872
She had other premonitions too.

01:08:04.508 --> 01:08:05.342
Like what?

01:08:08.878 --> 01:08:13.384
When you were a little boy,
the three of us went camping,

01:08:13.417 --> 01:08:16.120
and we were having a very
good time, but not you.

01:08:17.287 --> 01:08:22.125
You sat outside the
tent to protect us.

01:08:26.996 --> 01:08:31.100
You had that little
cat pistol.

01:08:33.635 --> 01:08:37.639
And you said that Aunt Helen
and I could go to sleep,

01:08:37.673 --> 01:08:38.974
and that you would protect us

01:08:39.008 --> 01:08:42.377
against any animal
that would harm us.

01:08:44.447 --> 01:08:47.283
And as Aunt Helen and
I were falling asleep,

01:08:48.817 --> 01:08:51.154
she rolled over and
she told me something

01:08:51.187 --> 01:08:52.921
that had come to her in a dream.

01:08:54.524 --> 01:08:57.426
She said one day Will

01:08:59.627 --> 01:09:00.895
will be very powerful.

01:10:53.039 --> 01:10:54.708
Did Will talk to him?

01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.909
He's not stopping.

01:11:01.747 --> 01:11:05.051
Your family and ours
have stuck together

01:11:05.085 --> 01:11:07.988
for many, many years.

01:11:12.925 --> 01:11:14.427
So what can we do for you?

01:11:57.403 --> 01:11:59.405
This is a critical
mission for the cause.

01:11:59.438 --> 01:12:02.474
There are very few people
outside this family we can trust.

01:12:05.311 --> 01:12:06.445
And I trust you.

01:12:09.315 --> 01:12:11.750
As I know you would
never hurt my daughter.

01:12:17.122 --> 01:12:17.922
Thank you.

01:12:19.558 --> 01:12:20.391
Thank you.

01:12:21.459 --> 01:12:23.328
And I won't let you down.

01:12:25.697 --> 01:12:26.731
See that you don't.

01:12:58.429 --> 01:12:59.697
Hi.

01:12:59.731 --> 01:13:00.531
What's wrong?

01:13:02.133 --> 01:13:03.501
Did you hear what happened?

01:13:05.636 --> 01:13:06.471
No, what?

01:13:10.507 --> 01:13:12.609
Nick got into some
trouble this morning.

01:13:16.613 --> 01:13:18.081
Is he all right?

01:13:18.115 --> 01:13:21.184
Last night I was with
him at the police station.

01:13:22.853 --> 01:13:24.855
He started firing his
gun in the street.

01:13:28.924 --> 01:13:29.892
I don't know why.

01:13:33.896 --> 01:13:36.166
- He'll be okay.
- He's not okay.

01:13:45.308 --> 01:13:46.810
Let's go inside.

01:17:03.603 --> 01:17:04.604
I.

01:17:04.637 --> 01:17:05.471
I know...

01:17:06.505 --> 01:17:07.340
where to dig.

01:17:18.450 --> 01:17:19.751
Get offa me.

01:17:19.784 --> 01:17:20.785
Get offa me!

01:17:21.786 --> 01:17:25.323
I'm not gonna tell you anything.

01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:53.151
Well?

01:17:53.184 --> 01:17:54.753
Where is it?

01:17:54.786 --> 01:17:55.786
Where is it?

01:18:33.158 --> 01:18:35.726
Tell me who put you
up to this, huh?

01:18:35.759 --> 01:18:36.827
Was it Shipe?

01:18:37.695 --> 01:18:38.529
Huh?

01:19:15.865 --> 01:19:16.833
Please,
I'm begging you.

01:19:16.866 --> 01:19:18.102
I need to speak to Will!

01:19:19.136 --> 01:19:20.170
Please, just get him!

01:19:20.204 --> 01:19:22.305
I think he's resting.

01:19:22.338 --> 01:19:23.706
Wake him, I
need to speak to him.

01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:24.741
- Will!
- Mary?

01:19:26.210 --> 01:19:27.443
Someone shot him.

01:19:27.477 --> 01:19:28.277
What?

01:19:29.146 --> 01:19:30.813
Someone shot Nick!

01:19:34.549 --> 01:19:36.952
- It's all right.
- He's gone.

01:20:59.433 --> 01:21:02.103
You shouldn't have done this!

01:21:49.616 --> 01:21:51.584
I'm gonna need you to...

01:21:52.752 --> 01:21:56.089
help me take something
out of the ground.

01:25:30.731 --> 01:25:31.799
Rope!

01:25:31.833 --> 01:25:33.268
Give me the rope!
