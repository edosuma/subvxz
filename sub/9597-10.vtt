storage before they were dumped?

10:27.678 --> 10:29.378
No, but look at this.

10:29.413 --> 10:35.084
All of them had their arms cut off
and all were encased in plaster.

10:35.119 --> 10:37.920
Did any of them have the deep
cuts in their face like this one?

10:37.955 --> 10:39.021
No.

So, this one was more personal.
We're looking for a serial killer.

that most serial killers are men ...

with overwhelming hostility and rage
toward women, often their mothers.

10:51.969 --> 10:55.671
And displaying his "work"
means he has a massive ego.

10:55.706 --> 10:57.240
He wants recognition.

10:57.274 --> 10:59.742
Frost, where were the
other four women found?

10:59.777 --> 11:03.379
Two playgrounds, a T-ball field,
and in front of a daycare center.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.248
All locations used by kids.

11:05.282 --> 11:07.917
And the four other
women were prostitutes.

start with our victim.

34:27.789 --> 34:29.656
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

34:32.393 --> 34:35.161
Thanks.
Jane, good news.

34:35.196 --> 34:37.630
- Frederick Stone turned up.
- Where?

34:37.665 --> 34:39.032
Arrested two nights ago
in Denver on a D.U.I.

34:39.067 --> 34:41.869
- Still there. Couldn't post bail.
- So, he's not our killer.

34:41.902 --> 34:45.938
Nope. 
And Todd Brown isn't our killer.

34:45.974 --> 34:50.444
Okay. All of our victims
had really young children

34:50.478 --> 34:54.380
except for Rachel Dugan, A.K.A. Cruella,
who's much older than everybody else.

34:54.415 --> 34:57.083
- What do we know about her kid?
- Think it was a son.

34:58.553 --> 35:02.055
Yeah, right here ... Mark Dugan.
He'd be 36 now.

35:02.090 --> 35:03.156
What happened to him?

35:03.191 --> 35:06.293
Says he was taken away from her
after repeated episodes of abuse.

35:06.327 --> 35:07.527
She ever burn him with cigarettes?

35:07.562 --> 35:12.032
Yeah.
On the soles of his feet.

35:12.066 --> 35:13.967
We need to find him.

35:14.002 --> 35:15.869
He was made a ward
of the state when he was 5.

35:15.904 --> 35:17.304
Keep digging, guys.

35:17.338 --> 35:19.873
[ sighs ] I'm sorry. I got
to take care of something.

35:21.442 --> 35:24.044
Don't you touch me!
Don't you friggin' touch me!

35:24.078 --> 35:26.513
- Ohh!
- I called Maura. She's not answering.

35:26.547 --> 35:29.549
- Oh, god.
- Oh, god! Get it out!

35:29.584 --> 35:31.018
Okay, Lydia, Lydia, Lydia,

35:31.052 --> 35:33.868
let's let the nice paramedics
take you to the hospital. 

35:33.986 --> 35:36.290
- No!!
- Geez, this girl's got some pipes.

35:36.324 --> 35:38.425
Okay, okay. I think the baby is coming.

35:38.459 --> 35:41.728
- Listen. Lydia, push.
- No, Lydia, don't push!

35:41.763 --> 35:47.367
- It's really stuck! Tommy, help!
- Okay, okay. Is that it?

35:47.402 --> 35:49.603
Oh, geez!

35:49.637 --> 35:51.538
Okay, now she wants someone with
medical training. Get in there.

35:51.572 --> 35:52.839
- Angela: Whoa.
- Where are you going?

35:52.874 --> 35:54.541
Away from that!

35:54.575 --> 35:55.709
Aw, come on...
find anything on Mark Dugan?

35:55.743 --> 35:58.078
- Should we do something?
- Babies are born every day.

35:58.112 --> 36:00.180
We got a serial killer on
the loose. You turn around.

36:00.214 --> 36:02.082
I don't need you passing out.
What'd you find on Dugan?

36:02.116 --> 36:04.184
You want to talk ...
You want to talk about that right now?

36:04.218 --> 36:06.219
What?

36:06.254 --> 36:08.155
She's between contractions. 
Talk fast.

36:08.189 --> 36:10.857
Well, he bounced around from
foster home to foster home.

36:10.892 --> 36:12.192
Lots of abuse. He ran away at 8

36:12.226 --> 36:14.127
and found his working-girl,
drug-addicted mother.

36:14.162 --> 36:15.395
She abused him some more

36:15.430 --> 36:17.097
before she dragged him
back to another foster home.

36:17.131 --> 36:18.398
<i>Lydia: Aah!!</i>

36:18.433 --> 36:20.300
- Whoa!
- Everything okay?

36:20.335 --> 36:23.103
- Yeah. Fine.
- Uh, okay.

36:23.137 --> 36:26.239
One of the senior criminalists
was looking for you.

36:26.274 --> 36:27.374
Tox results are back
on the third victim.

36:27.408 --> 36:29.843
- Do you have them?
- Nobody knows me down there.

36:29.877 --> 36:31.011
[ sighs ]

36:31.045 --> 36:32.980
- I'll see you upstairs.
- Okay.

36:33.014 --> 36:34.848
Come on. I'll introduce
you to everybody.

36:34.882 --> 36:36.650
Don't you want to know
if it's a boy or a girl?

36:36.684 --> 36:39.720
Why don't you text me when
you find out who the father is?

36:39.754 --> 36:43.256
- Come on, pop. Let's go.
- Go where?

36:44.926 --> 36:49.830
So, I try to make sure that I can be
here whenever Dr. Isles does an autopsy.

36:49.864 --> 36:53.467
- Maura?
- Hello, Detective.

36:53.501 --> 36:55.168
I have the results on
the additional tox screen.

36:55.203 --> 36:57.904
Oh, great. Thanks.
Uh, this is Detective Cooper.

36:57.939 --> 37:00.774
She just joined homicide.
Where's Dr. Isles?

37:00.808 --> 37:03.744
Oh, I-I think she stepped out
to have dinner with Mr. Rockmond.

37:03.778 --> 37:05.879
Dennis? Hmm.

37:05.913 --> 37:07.514
[ sighs ]

37:07.548 --> 37:10.784
You found Inderal in the
third victim's system?

37:11.886 --> 37:14.554
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

37:14.589 --> 37:19.226
Inderal was used as a sedative so the
killer could kill our third victim.

37:21.062 --> 37:24.431
Dennis Rockmond nearly
died of an inderal overdose.

37:24.465 --> 37:25.899
I still don't understand.

37:27.135 --> 37:31.171
And... 
he sculpted this hand for Maura.

37:36.544 --> 37:39.479
Riley, get all units to
Dennis Rockmond's address!

37:39.514 --> 37:43.784
Frost, get Korsak!
Meet me outside ... now!

37:49.823 --> 37:53.743
Classic art idealized the human
form, but artists often didn't

37:53.744 --> 37:57.663
understand key aspects, like the
layering of intercostal muscles. You do.

37:57.697 --> 38:00.833
I take tremendous pride
in everything I do.

38:00.867 --> 38:03.702
That's probably why you're
such a wonderful public speaker.

38:03.737 --> 38:05.171
[ chuckles ]

38:06.173 --> 38:08.040
Come here. 
Let me show you my work.

- Maura, you okay?
- What are you doing?

38:18.552 --> 38:20.352
[ Maura whimpers ]
Look behind you, Maura.

38:21.555 --> 38:24.290
- You see that pedestal, Maura?
- Don't you dare cut her throat!

38:24.324 --> 38:26.625
See that? Oh, that's
where I do my real work.

38:26.660 --> 38:29.562
You were gonna be my next creation.
I was gonna honor you.

38:29.596 --> 38:31.530
Just like my mother, you gave me life.

38:31.565 --> 38:33.499
[ whimpers ]

38:33.533 --> 38:35.267
You must think you're
real smart, huh, Detective?

38:35.302 --> 38:38.170
No, no, no. No. We're just lucky.
You're much smarter than us.

38:38.205 --> 38:39.371
You're damn right.

38:39.406 --> 38:41.473
Not even the genius
Dr. Isles could keep up with me.

38:41.508 --> 38:43.542
Please, please!

38:43.577 --> 38:45.744
Are you begging me, huh?
 Keep begging.

38:45.779 --> 38:47.479
- God, I like it when they beg.
- Oh, my god!

38:47.514 --> 38:49.682
No, no, wait, wait, wait!
Look, look, look.

38:49.716 --> 38:53.018
We're all in your hands, okay?
We're all in your hands.

39:01.428 --> 39:04.697
- You find my mother's hand?
- Yeah.

39:04.731 --> 39:07.233
You understand why I had
to take both of them, right?

39:07.267 --> 39:09.168
So she couldn't hurt you anymore.

39:12.305 --> 39:15.841
I left my creations at all the places
that I wanted to go with my Mommy.

39:18.111 --> 39:20.012
Wait!
W-w-wait!

39:20.046 --> 39:21.447
Why hurt Maura? 
Come on.

39:21.481 --> 39:25.551
Because her healing hands brought
me back to this Earth! That's why!

39:25.585 --> 39:27.453
Oh, my god! 
[ whimpers ]

39:27.487 --> 39:31.023
And now mothers maybe
will finally listen ...

39:31.057 --> 39:33.025
treat your kids right.

39:33.059 --> 39:35.694
Because you never know
who they'll grow up to be.

- No!

- No. How could I not know?
- No. Come on. Listen.

He evaded four different
jurisdictions, okay?

39:58.518 --> 40:01.220
Including us. Okay?
You said it yourself ...

40:01.254 --> 40:03.656
They're not all
reclusive monsters, okay?

40:03.690 --> 40:05.824
You couldn't have known.
You couldn't have known.

You haven't said a word
in over an hour, Maura.

I'm just trying to process
the worst day of my life.

40:27.247 --> 40:30.082
Stop beating yourself up, Maura.

40:30.116 --> 40:33.419
We all met him.
None of us spotted him.

40:35.021 --> 40:39.308
You know, the best behavioral
psychiatrists in the world will tell you

40:39.309 --> 40:43.595
that serial killers get away with
it because they appear so normal.

40:43.630 --> 40:47.700
Ugh. Why couldn't you two do
something else for a living?

40:49.703 --> 40:51.670
[ sighs ]

40:51.705 --> 40:52.805
I thought about being a ballerina.

40:52.839 --> 40:57.509
[ chuckling ] Yes, you did.
And you were so good at the fouettés.

40:57.544 --> 40:59.978
And then I wanted to
be a goalie in the NHL.

- Oh, that must be my yarn.
- My god, woman.

41:06.953 --> 41:09.822
How much yarn do you
need for a baby blanket?

41:09.823 --> 41:13.180
<i>And speaking of babies
I guess I have to ask, girl or boy?</i>

41:17.498 --> 41:19.599
Is it the yarn?

41:24.839 --> 41:26.640
It's Lydia's baby.
