[radio host]<i> News conference</i>
<i> a couple of days ago--</i>

02:57.711 --> 02:59.511
<i>a couple days ago-- a discovery</i>

02:59.513 --> 03:01.280
<i>of possible Earth-like planets,</i>

03:01.282 --> 03:03.382
<i> so we'll keep our eye</i>

03:05.486 --> 03:07.252
<i> Heh, well, what's next?</i>

03:07.254 --> 03:08.954
<i> All aboard the QE2.</i>

03:08.956 --> 03:10.956
<i> Not really, you don't</i>
<i> want to board this thing.</i>

03:10.958 --> 03:15.661
<i> It's an asteroid the size</i>
<i> of multiple cruise ships.</i>

03:15.663 --> 03:21.767
<i> 1998-QE2 is on the way for</i>
<i> a close encounter with Earth.</i>

03:21.769 --> 03:24.570
<i> Well, near Earth, meaning</i>

03:24.572 --> 03:27.873
<i> 3.6 million miles.</i> [laughing]

03:28.509 --> 03:31.343
<i> But still, as far as</i>
<i> a big asteroid's concerned,</i>

03:31.345 --> 03:32.444
<i> that's pretty close.</i>

03:33.414 --> 03:36.281
<i> They say it's not</i>
<i> going to hit us,</i>

03:36.283 --> 03:38.884
<i> which is good,</i>
<i> and I hope they're right.</i>

03:38.886 --> 03:40.819
<i> But I always have to think,</i>

03:40.821 --> 03:44.356
<i> are there any companions</i>
<i> that are traveling with it?</i>

03:44.358 --> 03:45.691
<i> You know, I'm not</i>
<i> a doom-and-gloom guy,</i>

03:45.693 --> 03:47.559

03:49.263 --> 03:50.462
<i>when these things are traveling,</i>

03:50.464 --> 03:51.630
<i> there's probably things</i>

03:51.632 --> 03:52.798

03:59.240 --> 04:01.406
<i> Okay, this has been SpaceGab,</i>

04:01.408 --> 04:04.676
<i> as always you can hear this</i>
<i> podcast and many others,</i>

04:04.678 --> 04:08.981
<i> www.spacegab.com,</i>
<i> thanks for listening.</i>

04:08.983 --> 04:09.915
<i> Bye-bye.</i>

04:11.785 --> 04:14.720
He was on last week talking
about farmers on Mars.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.392
I tell you, Roy,

04:20.394 --> 04:22.861
it's really great to
have you coming back out.

04:23.998 --> 04:26.965
What's it been,
two months, three months?

04:26.967 --> 04:28.000
Four.

04:29.336 --> 04:30.435
Well...

04:31.505 --> 04:32.571
well, it's great.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.773
It's not been the same.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.845
[shaking]

04:45.319 --> 04:48.387
So, anyway, um...

04:49.990 --> 04:52.591
finally got a camera
hooked up to the telescope.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.628
You wouldn't believe
the detail I'm getting
with these clear skies.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.698
I'm telling you, Roy,
once it's fully kitted out,

04:59.700 --> 05:01.667
I will be giving NASA
a run for their money.

05:03.704 --> 05:07.372
Once again, Harry, your humility
is an example to us all.

05:07.374 --> 05:10.909
[laughs]
Honestly, Roy, she's a beauty.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.079
You've named it, haven't you?

05:14.815 --> 05:17.949
Yeah, well, she's special.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.017
Of course.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.489
So, what you going
to do this evening?

05:26.694 --> 05:27.893
I don't know.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.976
Harry?

05:44.978 --> 05:46.645
[laughs] Sorry.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.081
I mean, I can
just fold it up, actually.

05:50.851 --> 05:51.783
Yeah.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.566
Astraeus?

06:12.873 --> 06:13.805
Mike?

06:14.541 --> 06:15.474
Yeah.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.610
He works with you?

06:21.115 --> 06:22.514
Yeah.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.484
He's been coming out
the last couple of weeks

06:25.486 --> 06:27.386
trialing some new tech
he's developing.

06:28.122 --> 06:29.988
[vehicle bumping]

06:29.990 --> 06:32.157
Could be some pretty
game-changing stuff apparently.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.926
-According to who?
-Well...

06:36.029 --> 06:37.696
According to Mike. [chuckles]

06:40.868 --> 06:42.934
Seriously, he's not out
here having fun like us,

06:42.936 --> 06:44.569
he's actually got
a lot riding on it.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.506
But to be honest,
it's all a bit above my head.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.175
Another classic astronomy pun.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.810
Like space,

06:51.812 --> 06:55.414
which is also above my head.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.983
I get it.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.418
I thought it was funny.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.758
Since you haven't
been here for a while,

07:06.760 --> 07:08.660
we had to move some
of your stuff in the back.

07:08.662 --> 07:09.995
Mike needed the room.

07:12.833 --> 07:13.865
Yeah, I noticed.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.138
You guys good friends?

07:21.842 --> 07:23.141
Why?

07:23.143 --> 07:24.209
Just wondering.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.047
Is that okay with you?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.215
Why wouldn't it be?

07:34.488 --> 07:35.787
I can think of a few reasons.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.823
[gentle music]

08:21.702 --> 08:22.834
You got yours?

08:24.204 --> 08:25.604
You going to wear it?

08:28.575 --> 08:29.508
Nah.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.779
[car door shuts]

09:43.050 --> 09:44.115
[Mike groaning]

09:44.117 --> 09:45.650
Looks heavy.

09:45.652 --> 09:46.618
Yeah, it is.

09:46.620 --> 09:49.287
Actually, could you just
give me a hand here?

09:52.059 --> 09:52.991
I'm busy.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.026
Doing what?

09:56.597 --> 09:59.331
Listen, while you were
snoring your head back there,

09:59.333 --> 10:00.832
I was watching the road.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.368
You mean you actually meant
to hit all those potholes?

10:03.370 --> 10:04.970
-What was that?
-Huh?

10:06.373 --> 10:08.173
Make sure you don't
drop that thing, okay?

10:08.175 --> 10:09.174
Yep.

10:14.881 --> 10:17.882
-You comfortable there, Roy?
-Oh, he's busy.

10:17.884 --> 10:20.986
Just helping Mike get all your
junk out of my new office.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.789
I'm surprised you guys
don't have this down
to a fine art yet.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.058
Just shut up and drink
your damn tea, okay?

10:28.362 --> 10:30.762
Well, here she is.

10:31.398 --> 10:32.697
Roy, this is Annabelle.

10:32.699 --> 10:34.032
Annabelle, Roy.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.901
Oh, my God. Does your
wife know about this?

10:36.903 --> 10:38.403
[Harry] Does she know
about what?

10:38.405 --> 10:40.205
That you've named
this thing after her.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.674
No, no. Not yet, no,

10:42.676 --> 10:44.743
but I think it's kind
of romantic, you know?

10:47.681 --> 10:50.749
After all, this thing's
beautiful, slender,

10:51.251 --> 10:52.817
makes life worth living.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.354
It's also stiff, and emotionless

10:56.356 --> 10:57.756
and weighs a ton,

10:57.758 --> 11:00.825
but I'm sure she'll
appreciate the sentiment.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.027
Yeah.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.996
Just gimme a hand
with it, will you?

11:04.998 --> 11:06.264
I've already asked him.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.749
[gentle music]

11:25.852 --> 11:27.118
[Mike scoffs]

Fire in the hole.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.484
[mechanical noises]

12:07.127 --> 12:08.493
Take it easy on the guy, okay?

12:09.429 --> 12:11.196
I haven't said anything, have I?

12:11.198 --> 12:12.363
I never say you said anything.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.132
I'm saying give him a chance.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.333
He's a decent bloke.

12:15.335 --> 12:18.737
-Yeah, don't worry about it.
-No, I mean it, Roy.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.506
I don't want any of
your funny business.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.742
Harry, I said,
don't worry about it.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.481
I was thinking tonight might
be my last night anyway.

12:29.483 --> 12:31.916
[solemn music]

12:36.423 --> 12:38.356
[computer beeping]

12:42.829 --> 12:44.395
[mechanical whirring]

13:04.451 --> 13:05.884
-[Mike] All set?
-Yeah, yeah.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.422
Could you pass me
that cable, Harry?

13:11.424 --> 13:13.024
-This one here?
-Yeah.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.193
-You got it?
-Yeah, thanks.

13:16.429 --> 13:17.362
Excuse me.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.337
Harry, if you route anymore
goddamn cables through there,

13:26.339 --> 13:28.273
-there's going to be
no room for me.
-Calm down,

13:28.275 --> 13:29.507
this is the only one I need.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.915
Well, then what are
the rest of these for?

13:37.217 --> 13:38.850
Can I rig this through here?

13:38.852 --> 13:40.919
[Harry] Yeah, I'm sure
Roy won't mind.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.389
Bring on the wireless
revolution, I say.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.862
Actually, Roy, could you just
pass me that other blue cable?

13:52.966 --> 13:53.998
Roy?

13:55.101 --> 13:56.868
It's just on the floor, yeah.

13:58.839 --> 14:01.206
Too many wires for my liking,
but what can you do, eh?

14:03.043 --> 14:03.975
Here.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.345
Cheers.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.013
Come on, last one, in you go.

14:10.917 --> 14:12.483
I tell you, whoever figures
out how to run this stuff

14:12.485 --> 14:14.586
without cables will be
a bloody millionaire.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.492
You know, it's actually
quite cramped in there, Roy.

14:22.596 --> 14:25.230
I don't know how you're
going to fit in there
with all them cables.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.104
[Mike] Okay, think
we're pretty much rigged.
Should be good to go.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.572
[Harry] Great.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.274
[Mike] What are your
plans tonight then?

14:36.276 --> 14:38.009
[Harry] More testing
on the scope's camera,

14:38.011 --> 14:40.044
thankfully the skies
are clear tonight.

14:40.046 --> 14:43.047
[Mike] Chilly though,
it's always a trade-off really.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.483
[gentle music]

14:56.229 --> 14:58.396
[Mike] Yeah, actually,
I just need one more cable.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.531
[Harry] Which cable
is it you want?

15:00.533 --> 15:04.269
[Mike] That's the blue one
there, yeah, that's the one.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.638
-[clunking]
-What the hell is going on?

15:06.640 --> 15:09.073
[Mike] Yeah, okay, great.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.942
-[rubbing against glass]
-[Mike laughing]

15:13.914 --> 15:15.446
[knocking]

15:18.318 --> 15:20.685
-[Mike] Roy looks happy
in there.
-[Harry] Yeah.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.655
[sighs] This is going
to be a long night.

[Harry sighs]

15:49.516 --> 15:51.182
[door closes]

15:51.184 --> 15:53.051
Bloody cold, actually.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.352
I guess the summer's over then?

15:54.354 --> 15:56.220
Yeah, all two weeks of it.

15:56.222 --> 15:58.623
[chuckles] Yeah, nothing
like a British summer.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.201
[groans]

16:10.203 --> 16:11.569
What is...

16:14.240 --> 16:15.606
It's for the scope.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.342
Sometimes branches
get in the way.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.151
-Harry?
-Yep.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.487
-What the hell is this?
-Uh, well, that is a claw.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.523
I can see it's a claw.
What's it doing in the car?

16:32.525 --> 16:34.759
Well, it's for, you know,
clawing things.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.728
Doesn't matter,
just give it here, thank you.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.564
It's for clawing things,
of course, how stupid of me.

16:40.266 --> 16:41.566
No wonder there's no room.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.138
Right then, boys.
Let's get to work.

16:51.544 --> 16:52.477
Mint?

16:54.114 --> 16:55.046
Not for me.

16:56.783 --> 16:57.715
Go on.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.052
No.

17:01.054 --> 17:01.786
Thank you.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.289
Harry, mint?

17:06.526 --> 17:09.193
Yeah, go on then. Thank you.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.375
Can I have a cuppa, Roy?

21:17.944 --> 21:19.410
Oh, sorry. That was my last one.

21:20.346 --> 21:21.479
If I'd have known.

21:22.515 --> 21:23.648
Oh, well.

21:23.650 --> 21:24.982
No worries.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.811
Have I said something wrong?

21:54.080 --> 21:55.012
Why?

21:56.582 --> 21:58.616
Just Roy seems
a bit off with me.

21:58.618 --> 22:00.484
[chuckles] No, he's off
with everyone lately.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.053
He's just complicated like that.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.424
I'll move my stuff in the boot,
give him his old spot back.

22:06.426 --> 22:08.526
Mike, trust me.
It's nothing you've done.

22:08.528 --> 22:09.827
He'll come around.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.068
So, how's all this
coming along then?

22:18.104 --> 22:19.403
Uh...

22:19.939 --> 22:22.606
well, slow. [chuckles]

22:22.608 --> 22:24.809
Slow. Yeah,
that sounds about right.

22:24.811 --> 22:25.843
Yeah, quite.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.679
They said if I can't
get a working prototype

22:28.681 --> 22:30.481
by the end of the month,
they're going to cut my funding,

22:30.483 --> 22:31.549
which is...

22:32.485 --> 22:34.618
not good, really.

22:36.656 --> 22:37.955
The tweaks we made last
week are looking good,

22:37.957 --> 22:39.724
so I'm hopeful for tonight.

22:41.127 --> 22:43.127
Well, I was telling Roy about it
on the way over, actually.

22:43.129 --> 22:44.995
He seemed pretty interested.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.998
Maybe you should run it by him,
see what he makes of it.

22:48.935 --> 22:50.701
Yeah.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.103
-Yeah, I will do.
-He'd like that.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.139
He's a bit of a socially
awkward person really.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.641
Yeah.

22:57.643 --> 22:58.776
I know what you mean. [chuckles]

23:02.949 --> 23:04.382
So...

23:05.618 --> 23:07.385
How'd you get
into all this, anyway?

23:08.855 --> 23:10.054
Well,

23:10.056 --> 23:11.522
my dad's to blame for that one.

23:11.991 --> 23:13.724
Which is always the way, right?

23:15.027 --> 23:16.827
Took me to see
the Perseid meteor shower

23:16.829 --> 23:18.062
when I was about seven.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.065
And that was that.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.066
[soft music]

23:22.068 --> 23:23.634
I never looked back.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.638
I remember him telling me that
everything down here on Earth,

23:27.640 --> 23:30.040
everything we are,
everything we're made of,

23:30.977 --> 23:32.042
comes from up there.

23:33.179 --> 23:34.612
[Mike chuckles]

23:34.614 --> 23:38.516
20 plus years later,
I'm a doctor of astrophysics,

23:38.518 --> 23:40.951
and I'm getting paid
to study distant stars.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.686
It's all a bit crazy, really.

23:43.589 --> 23:44.955
And here we are. [chuckles]

23:44.957 --> 23:45.890
And here we are.

23:48.127 --> 23:49.927
Want to listen
to some more SpaceGab?

23:51.030 --> 23:52.129
Yeah.

23:54.901 --> 23:57.034
[radio host]
<i> As I've been reporting</i>
<i> and gabbing about</i>

23:57.036 --> 23:59.603
<i> on SpaceGab two podcasts ago,</i>

23:59.605 --> 24:03.841
<i> they're looking for Martian</i>
<i> farmers.</i> [radio host laughing]

24:03.843 --> 24:06.644
<i> Not really, not looking</i>
<i> for Martian farmers up there.</i>

24:06.646 --> 24:09.046
[laughs]<i> It's a big thing</i>
<i> growing food up there</i>

24:09.048 --> 24:13.184
<i> because you could only eat</i>
<i> so many tubes of steak</i>

24:13.186 --> 24:15.853
<i> or whatever else they're going</i>
<i> to bring up there with them...</i>

24:26.899 --> 24:28.165
Roy?

24:28.167 --> 24:29.834
Hi, Roy.

24:29.836 --> 24:31.068
I don't think we've been
properly introduced.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.203
I'm Mike.

24:32.205 --> 24:34.905
Harry's told me a lot about
you over the last few weeks,

24:34.907 --> 24:36.740
and it's great
to finally meet you.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.243
It sounds like
you two go way back.

24:40.980 --> 24:41.912
Yeah.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.083
Anyway, he was telling
me you were interested

24:46.085 --> 24:47.618
in the project I'm working on.

24:49.722 --> 24:50.955
Right.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.524
Still trying to
debug the system,

24:53.526 --> 24:56.994
making a few tweaks,
but it should work now.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.566
So, I listen to space.

25:03.669 --> 25:04.635
That's what I do.

25:04.637 --> 25:07.838
Nothing new, but still
pretty incredible, eh?

25:08.741 --> 25:10.774
Do you know much
about radio astronomy?

25:11.944 --> 25:13.143
Not a lot.

25:13.145 --> 25:17.081
That's cool.
Basically, I study
distant objects in space

25:17.083 --> 25:18.916
through their radio frequencies,

25:18.918 --> 25:20.284
and there's
a lot of things up there:

25:20.286 --> 25:23.687
stars, Pulsars, Quasars,

25:23.689 --> 25:25.222
and they all emit radio waves,

25:25.224 --> 25:27.291
and these waves travel
through space like light,

25:27.293 --> 25:32.563
and we can listen in using
radio equipment, like this.

25:33.132 --> 25:35.633
-[static crackling]
-[gentle music]

25:37.570 --> 25:39.770
But if we use radio telescopes,

25:39.772 --> 25:41.705
we can take it a step further,

25:41.707 --> 25:46.644
capturing all this incoming
data and convert it into images.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.812
Learn more about the Universe
that we live in.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.916
Obviously,
we can't see radio waves,

25:51.918 --> 25:55.152
but if we could see radio waves,
then this is what we'd see,

25:56.222 --> 25:59.924
that's Saturn, this is the Moon,

25:59.926 --> 26:03.694
and these are
a couple of galaxies.

26:04.063 --> 26:07.731
Check this out, if we collect
all of this incoming data,

26:07.733 --> 26:10.000
then you can build
a picture of what space...

26:11.304 --> 26:12.303
sounds like.

26:18.611 --> 26:19.944
Beautiful, isn't it?

26:24.050 --> 26:26.083
I'm hoping to make
my own with this program.

26:27.219 --> 26:29.720
Anyway, the super cool
thing about radio astronomy

26:29.722 --> 26:31.789
is that you can see the universe

26:31.791 --> 26:33.324
in a completely different way.

26:34.994 --> 26:37.328
You know, get her to give up
more of her secrets. [laughs]

26:38.030 --> 26:40.130
Now, but the problem
with all this incoming data

26:40.132 --> 26:42.666
is that it usually takes weeks,
months to process,

26:42.668 --> 26:47.838
but I think I've found a way
to see what we're getting
as we're getting it,

26:47.840 --> 26:50.608
effectively a real-time
visual render program,

26:50.610 --> 26:52.710
which will seriously speed up
the whole process.

26:53.846 --> 26:54.778
In theory.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.133
In theory, yeah.

26:59.134 --> 27:00.050
Unfortunately, that's
what most of my investors

27:00.052 --> 27:01.352
are beginning to think it is,

27:01.354 --> 27:02.720
but I it will work.

27:04.323 --> 27:06.223
I just need more time.

27:06.225 --> 27:08.192
Obviously, it's tough for him,

27:08.194 --> 27:10.894
his antenna's nothing
compared to the big ones.

27:10.896 --> 27:11.929
Yeah.

27:13.399 --> 27:15.366
But it'll give me enough
to prove the system works.

27:17.870 --> 27:20.004
Anyway, let me show you.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.678
[tense music]

27:34.286 --> 27:35.986
Wait, that's not right at all.

27:38.691 --> 27:40.724
Well, what's that, what the
hell is that supposed to be?

27:40.726 --> 27:42.359
-Is it the Moon again?
-It's not the Moon.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.832
[sighs] It's another glitch.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.104
I'm sorry, Roy.
I thought I was close

27:54.106 --> 27:55.339
but it's still not working.

27:56.075 --> 27:57.741
[solemn music]

28:00.346 --> 28:01.812
I wish I could show you.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.988
Stick with it, Mike.

28:10.990 --> 28:13.123
You'll crack it
eventually, I know it.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.889
[tense music]

28:47.259 --> 28:49.159
[static crackling]

29:45.818 --> 29:47.918
[garbled speech]

29:49.421 --> 29:51.955
[suspenseful music]

29:54.426 --> 29:56.994
[light rhythmic thumping]

30:21.520 --> 30:23.287
1420.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.825
[static crackling]

30:35.201 --> 30:36.934
[static crackling]

30:48.981 --> 30:51.215
[machine beeping]

31:21.080 --> 31:22.946
-Harry?
-Mm-hmm?

31:23.649 --> 31:24.581
Harry?

31:25.551 --> 31:27.050
Listen to this.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.559
What?

31:35.561 --> 31:37.594
-What? what do you mean, "What"?
-What am I listening to?

31:37.596 --> 31:38.562
Well, the blips.

31:43.002 --> 31:44.301
I don't hear no blips, Mike.

31:46.972 --> 31:47.971
Did you record it?

31:49.008 --> 31:50.107
No, I was asleep.

31:53.646 --> 31:56.046
-It's 1420.
-Oh, no.

31:56.048 --> 31:58.248
Not little green men again,
is it, Mike?

31:58.250 --> 32:01.018
-You going to send these lot
a message as well?
-Look, don't start.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.654
Have the others
replied yet, by the way?
It's just I've only got

32:03.656 --> 32:06.323
22,000 years
to get the house straight.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.292
Did you ask them if they liked
lemon sponge or fruitcake?

32:08.294 --> 32:10.360
It's just I want
to be ready, that's all.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.195
Harry, it's 1420.

32:12.197 --> 32:14.097
I just don't like
unexpected visitors, Mike,

32:14.099 --> 32:15.399
especially the little
green kind.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.134
1420, that's the water hole.

32:17.136 --> 32:18.468
Well, the water hole's dried up.

32:18.470 --> 32:22.105
Maybe it's those farmers on Mars
complaining about lack of rain.

32:22.107 --> 32:25.208
-Oh, for goodness sake.
-This is your
long-range weather forecast

32:25.210 --> 32:26.977
for all you
crop-growers out there.

32:26.979 --> 32:29.446
It looks like a cool
minus 55 outside

32:29.448 --> 32:32.249
and this dusty, dry spell
sweeping in from the east

32:32.251 --> 32:36.019
is here to stay for
the next million years. [laughs]

32:37.222 --> 32:38.722
It wasn't funny
last week, Harry.

32:41.493 --> 32:45.462
-I bet it was a Pulsar.
-Pulsar?
-Yep.

32:45.464 --> 32:48.065
-No.
-I know what a bloody
Pulsar sounds like, Mike.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.433
I might not listen to them for
a living, but they're very
much in my field.

32:49.435 --> 32:53.570
-I'm sure you do, Harry, but you
didn't hear this, did you?
-Did you hear it?

32:53.572 --> 32:56.073
But it wasn't a Pulsar,
not with this antenna.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.975
Well, it's not little green men
if that's what you're saying?

32:57.977 --> 32:59.509
-That's not what I'm saying.
-Then what are you saying?

32:59.511 --> 33:01.244
-Well--
-Look, a Pulsar--

33:01.246 --> 33:02.446
It wasn't a Pulsar.

33:03.515 --> 33:05.482
I know Pulsars, all right?

33:05.484 --> 33:08.618
I listen to them day in,
day out. It wasn't a Pulsar.

33:09.221 --> 33:11.989
Look, I wouldn't worry
about it, Mike, everyone's
listening to the water hole.

33:11.991 --> 33:14.124
If you've heard it,
they've heard it too.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.493
So, you've all been listening
to Pulsars together.

33:20.032 --> 33:22.566
Right, I'm going
to re-calibrate the scope.

33:22.568 --> 33:23.700
I'll be back in a bit.

33:27.740 --> 33:30.273
Remember,
lemon cake or fruitcake?

33:30.275 --> 33:32.409
I know which one you are,
I just want to know
which ones they prefer,

33:32.411 --> 33:33.577
but I think I know that already.

33:33.579 --> 33:35.345
Get the hell out of here.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.513
Pulsar.

33:37.316 --> 33:39.349
Look, it wasn't a Pulsar.

33:44.156 --> 33:46.356
[static crackling]

33:49.094 --> 33:50.727
[tense music]

34:14.820 --> 34:15.752
Roy?

34:21.527 --> 34:22.459
Roy?

34:25.764 --> 34:26.696
Roy?

34:30.302 --> 34:31.668
[soft tense music]

35:15.214 --> 35:16.146
Oh.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.470
[radio host]<i> Okay,</i>
<i> you're listening to DJ Jimmy</i>

35:40.472 --> 35:43.273
<i> playing all</i>
<i> the classic club bangers!</i>

35:43.275 --> 35:45.342
<i> 101.4 throughout the night--</i>

35:47.379 --> 35:48.578
[Roy snoring]

35:48.580 --> 35:49.746
[Mike sighs]

35:57.623 --> 35:59.789
[gentle music]

36:08.500 --> 36:11.501
Greetings on behalf of
the people of my world.

36:12.638 --> 36:14.538
This is Mike Webster...

36:15.574 --> 36:16.907
of Planet Earth.

36:18.410 --> 36:19.609
We are here.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.579
We are not afraid.

36:23.949 --> 36:26.349
If you are out there
and you are listening,

36:26.351 --> 36:27.851
this is a routine response

36:27.853 --> 36:29.452
to an acquired signal at...

36:30.455 --> 36:33.590
01:33 GMT,

36:33.959 --> 36:37.227
16.10.16.

36:38.797 --> 36:39.863
Unidentified source.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.334
Your signal made it.

36:45.671 --> 36:46.903
We are listening.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.774
Oh, and if this is
the local police station,

36:50.776 --> 36:52.809
I'm sorry if I'm interfering
with your gear again.

36:54.980 --> 36:58.215
But perhaps you should have
invested in some better
radio equipment.

36:58.817 --> 37:01.251
[tense music]

37:24.009 --> 37:25.342
So.

37:25.344 --> 37:26.676
[Mike sighs]

37:27.946 --> 37:29.479
Speak English, do they?

37:30.015 --> 37:32.315
You heard that, then?

37:32.317 --> 37:33.984
Probably the only person
who ever will.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.720
Harry's certainly got
some interesting friends.

37:36.722 --> 37:39.256
Oh, please, don't tell him.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.758
Don't worry, I wouldn't dare
repeat some of the weirdness

37:41.760 --> 37:44.427
I've heard in the company
of scientists.

37:49.534 --> 37:52.535
So, should I set a place
at the table for the Pulsar?

37:53.472 --> 37:54.404
Like I said.

37:54.406 --> 37:58.408
Picked up some pretty
interesting things last week,
didn't you Mike?

37:58.410 --> 38:00.443
Thought you'd made contact
with some intelligent life.

38:00.445 --> 38:01.845
Yeah, not so intelligent life.

38:01.847 --> 38:04.848
No, turned out to be two
traffic cops off the A38.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.383
[Roy laughing]

38:07.419 --> 38:09.052
-[Roy] Brilliant.
-It really was.

38:09.054 --> 38:11.054
Played havoc
with their radio systems.

38:11.056 --> 38:12.455
They thought it was
some sort of threat

38:12.457 --> 38:14.491
from the local crime ring.

38:14.493 --> 38:17.460
-Within minutes,
choppers were all over us.
-Yeah, all right.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.863
-Still didn't catch you
though, did they, Mike?
-Okay, very good.

38:19.865 --> 38:21.598
-[Roy laughs]
-He's a wanted man, you know.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.066
[Mike chuckles]

38:24.069 --> 38:25.802
[Harry laughing]

38:37.949 --> 38:39.749
Harry, can I use
your scope on this pass?

38:40.452 --> 38:41.785
Yeah, just give us a sec.

38:46.358 --> 38:47.757
It's coming over in about two.

38:49.328 --> 38:51.561
Uh, okay, do you want
to boot it up at your station

38:51.563 --> 38:53.763
-or do you want to use mine?
-No, I'll stay here.

38:53.765 --> 38:56.366
Right, just type in
your elevation

38:56.368 --> 38:58.635
and bearings like before,
and the scope should auto-track.

38:58.637 --> 38:59.769
Okay.

39:17.889 --> 39:20.357
-[scope whirring]
-[gentle music]

40:31.897 --> 40:33.830
[machine beeping]

40:33.832 --> 40:35.532
What just happened?

40:38.103 --> 40:41.037
-What's that?
-I, I don't know,
I've just lost it.

40:42.207 --> 40:44.641
-What?
-Goodman, it's just gone.

40:45.710 --> 40:48.711
-[sighs] I don't understand
what you mean, Roy.
-The Goodman, it's disappeared.

40:48.713 --> 40:51.748
-All right, calm down.
-Well, I'm looking at it,
Harry, and it's gone.

40:52.651 --> 40:54.517
[tense music]

40:54.519 --> 40:55.752
What are you talking about, Roy?

40:55.754 --> 40:56.953
It's right there.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.096
-[Roy] I'm telling you, Harry.
-Satellites don't
just vanish, Roy.

41:07.098 --> 41:09.732
-I know what I saw,
it just went blank on me.
-All right, guys.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.201
Chill out.

41:12.237 --> 41:13.603
It's just a satellite.

41:14.606 --> 41:15.905
Just a satellite?

41:16.675 --> 41:18.875
Yeah, what's the big deal?

41:20.879 --> 41:22.545
Who the hell
do you think you are?

41:23.715 --> 41:25.048
You have no idea,

41:25.750 --> 41:26.950
no idea what's
going here, do you?

41:26.952 --> 41:28.818
-He doesn't know.
-Well, he should.

41:31.256 --> 41:32.889
He took my job.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.393
For Christ's sake, Roy.
Give him a break.

41:36.394 --> 41:37.627
You know what?
I've just about had
enough of this lecturing.

41:37.629 --> 41:39.128
And what's that
supposed to mean, Roy?

41:39.698 --> 41:41.231
It means what it means, Harry.

41:44.936 --> 41:46.569
[door slams]

41:49.741 --> 41:50.940
[Roy sighs]

41:50.942 --> 41:52.909
Mike, I am so sorry about that.

42:01.620 --> 42:03.653
[Mike] What did Roy mean,
I took his job?

42:06.057 --> 42:08.124
There's something
you need to know about Roy.

42:10.228 --> 42:12.028
Goodman,
that satellite up there,

42:12.030 --> 42:14.564
that's his, or as good as his.

42:16.968 --> 42:18.902
Do you remember ENSAT Aerospace?

42:19.905 --> 42:21.571
Yeah, sure, yeah.

42:21.573 --> 42:23.540
Well, Roy used to work for them

42:23.542 --> 42:25.942
as their lead aviation engineer,

42:25.944 --> 42:28.678
helped develop navigation
systems for the military,

42:28.680 --> 42:30.880
you know, fighter jets,
that sort of thing.

42:31.850 --> 42:34.851
I really looked up
to him, I still do.

42:36.688 --> 42:37.854
But don't tell him I said that.

42:37.856 --> 42:39.222
[Mike chuckles]

42:39.224 --> 42:40.690
[solemn music]

42:43.862 --> 42:46.129
A couple of years ago
ENSAT won a contract

42:46.131 --> 42:48.598
to manufacture
a research satellite,

42:48.600 --> 42:50.800
and Roy was selected
to head up the project.

42:52.270 --> 42:53.870
I was assigned to help them
develop some of their

42:53.872 --> 42:55.872
instrumentation
for the satellite.

42:58.343 --> 43:00.009
That's how I met Roy.

43:01.580 --> 43:03.279
He's a bloody
good engineer, you know?

43:03.882 --> 43:05.682
Took the project well
beyond my expectations

43:05.684 --> 43:07.650
for the science
we could achieve.

43:13.992 --> 43:14.958
Anyway...

43:16.628 --> 43:17.961
about a year ago,

43:18.897 --> 43:21.130
three or so months
before delivery,

43:21.132 --> 43:24.734
Astraeus, the company
you work for, came along
and acquired ENSAT.

43:28.206 --> 43:30.006
And they fired him.

43:30.809 --> 43:32.909
They fired him and all his team,

43:32.911 --> 43:34.344
straight out, non-negotiable.

43:36.314 --> 43:38.881
Astraeus wanted
the prestige of delivering
the satellite themselves,

43:38.883 --> 43:41.284
so they got their own guys
to come in and finish it off.

43:43.254 --> 43:45.688
I mean, we'd done 99%
of the work, of course, but...

43:47.025 --> 43:48.358
that wasn't the point.

43:53.031 --> 43:54.364
It hit him hard.

43:56.134 --> 43:57.967
Three years he gave to Goodman.

43:58.970 --> 44:01.204
He brought it to life,
he taught it to think,

44:02.107 --> 44:04.273
and he wasn't even
invited to see it launch.

44:10.649 --> 44:12.649
When you dedicate so much
of your life to something,

44:12.651 --> 44:13.950
it becomes a part of you.

44:15.720 --> 44:18.221
And Astraeus took it away
from him like it was nothing.

44:23.828 --> 44:25.428
Harry, I had no idea.

44:26.097 --> 44:27.230
Well, why would you?

44:28.366 --> 44:30.767
But Roy just
sees you as Astraeus.

44:32.037 --> 44:33.269
And although that doesn't
excuse what just happened,

44:33.271 --> 44:35.271
it does explain why it happened.

44:39.944 --> 44:40.877
I'm sorry.

44:43.148 --> 44:45.281
It's my fault,
I should have explained it.

44:49.454 --> 44:52.021
Being on the research team,
I didn't work for ENSAT,

44:52.023 --> 44:54.891
so I stayed on and that
obviously complicated things.

44:56.828 --> 44:58.828
I thought he'd be
over it by now, but...

45:13.912 --> 45:15.478
This was our little group.

45:16.981 --> 45:18.247
The Astro-Nuts.

45:20.285 --> 45:21.951
Just me, Roy and another.

45:23.254 --> 45:25.288
We all worked on the project,
dumb really,

45:25.290 --> 45:26.422
but it was just a bit of fun.

45:29.894 --> 45:31.260
Roy and I used to come out here

45:31.262 --> 45:32.929
and imagine
seeing our satellite.

45:36.167 --> 45:38.201
It was supposed to be this
great moment, you know?

45:39.370 --> 45:40.970
We built that and it's in space.

45:44.375 --> 45:47.043
But now Roy, just looks up and
he sees everything he's lost.

47:07.325 --> 47:08.858
I thought you'd had
your last cup?

47:09.427 --> 47:10.560
This is my last cup.

47:15.500 --> 47:16.432
Thanks, Roy.

47:22.106 --> 47:23.873
[Mike sighs]

47:23.875 --> 47:26.075
Here, Harry, have some of this.

47:27.412 --> 47:29.345
Ah, thanks, mate.

47:34.485 --> 47:35.484
Lovely stuff.

47:41.426 --> 47:42.358
Roy?

47:44.529 --> 47:46.128
I'm good, it's all yours.

47:47.098 --> 47:48.431
[Mike laughs]

47:54.906 --> 47:56.405
Right.

47:56.407 --> 47:58.474

56:47.104 --> 56:49.738
but the falloff on this thing's
like nothing I've ever seen.

56:50.074 --> 56:51.940
<i>We are here, we are not afraid.</i>

56:52.977 --> 56:54.643
[tense music]

56:54.645 --> 56:56.879
Mike, what was your cycle rate?

56:58.549 --> 57:01.183
-Cycle rate?
-Yeah, how many cycles
did you transmit?

57:01.185 --> 57:04.086
-[Mike] Why?
-Because we're hearing this
thing loop over and over.

57:05.189 --> 57:07.656
I dunno, a half a dozen or so.
Look, it was just a bit of fun.

57:07.658 --> 57:09.758
Yeah, but have we not heard it
more times than that already?

57:09.760 --> 57:13.128
-Yeah, definitely.
-Then it can't be
a straight bounce.

57:13.130 --> 57:16.198
-That's what I've been saying.
-No, no, no, what you're
saying is it can't be a bounce

57:16.200 --> 57:18.767
as there's nothing at that
range to bounce back off from.

57:19.537 --> 57:21.570
What I'm saying is,
how can this be a bounce

57:21.572 --> 57:23.005
if it's now looping more times

57:23.007 --> 57:24.907
than the original
cycles you transmitted?

57:25.876 --> 57:27.009
Am I right?

57:29.780 --> 57:31.213
I'm right, right?

57:31.215 --> 57:33.916
[dramatic music]

57:33.918 --> 57:35.918
Are you sure
you're rolling on this?

57:36.987 --> 57:38.854
-Yeah, hundred percent.
-Holy Christ.

57:39.757 --> 57:42.124
We need confirmation
on this, Mike, rapid.

57:42.126 --> 57:43.225
Call it in.

57:43.227 --> 57:46.061
I'll check to see if there's
any chatter over at SETI.

57:46.897 --> 57:48.464

<i> -No, I'm not, my shift is up.</i>

58:27.171 --> 58:29.872

<i> -Of course not, Mike.</i>

58:29.874 --> 58:32.674
<i> If something was--</i>
<i>Look, if something was going on,</i>

58:32.676 --> 58:35.010
<i>-someone would have woken me up.</i>
-Well, What the bloody hell
do you think I'm doing, Dave?

58:35.012 --> 58:38.146
-Get up!
<i> -I've got to be up at four</i>
<i> o'clock in the bloody morning.</i>

58:38.148 --> 58:40.048
Dave, we've got
a target signal here.

58:40.050 --> 58:42.184
<i> What? Where are you?</i>

58:42.186 --> 58:43.986
What do you mean where am I?
It doesn't matter where I am.

58:43.988 --> 58:46.021
Can you just get up, we need
an affirm on this, ASAP.

58:46.624 --> 58:49.224
<i> Okay, okay, give me a minute,</i>
<i> I'll go to the control room.</i>

58:50.794 --> 58:54.596
-Any talk on the servers?
-No, I guess everyone's
just working the signal.

58:54.598 --> 58:55.797
We must have caught it early.

58:55.799 --> 58:56.999
[suspenseful music]

58:57.001 --> 58:58.800
Dave? Dave, you there?

58:59.703 --> 59:01.270

<i> a frequency for me?</i>

59:01.272 --> 59:03.605

<i> Mike, we're listening</i>

59:13.117 --> 59:15.617
<i> -to that frequency 24/7.</i>
-Dave, run the numbers,

59:15.619 --> 59:16.952
I'm telling you, you'll hear it.

59:17.555 --> 59:19.254
<i> Okay, hang on a minute,</i>
<i> we'll have a listen.</i>

59:20.057 --> 59:21.657
We've got a lot of
surface clutter, Dave.

59:21.659 --> 59:23.058
See if you can
clean it up your end.

59:23.060 --> 59:23.992
<i> Will do.</i>

59:25.796 --> 59:27.696
Mike, what is the Waterhole?

59:29.767 --> 59:31.133
The electromagnetic spectrum

59:31.135 --> 59:32.334
is just cluttered
with garble, right?

59:32.336 --> 59:34.570
Trying to spot an intelligent
signal within that

59:34.571 --> 59:36.805
is like trying to have a
conversation at rock concert,

59:36.807 --> 59:38.974
you just can't do it,
but at 1420 megahertz,

59:41.078 --> 59:42.978
there's a natural dead spot.

59:42.979 --> 59:44.879
It's like a quiet tunnel
cutting through all the noise.

59:44.882 --> 59:46.715
-And that's the Waterhole?
-Right.

59:47.618 --> 59:48.817
If you want to send
a signal out into space,

59:48.819 --> 59:49.818
the Waterhole's your best chance

59:49.820 --> 59:50.886
of getting it heard.

59:55.793 --> 59:56.725
Dave?

59:59.263 --> 1:00:00.629
How's it looking there, mate?

1:00:01.098 --> 1:00:02.164
<i> Uh...</i>

1:00:02.166 --> 1:00:05.334
<i> Standby. We're not</i>
<i> hearing anything yet.</i>

1:00:05.836 --> 1:00:07.636
Like I said, there's a lot of
clutter, but the transmission's

1:00:07.638 --> 1:00:09.605
pretty damn obvious,
you know what I mean?

1:00:09.907 --> 1:00:12.207
<i> Yeah, we're still getting</i>
<i> zip here, Mike.</i>

1:00:12.209 --> 1:00:13.875
Well, I don't understand
how that can be, we've got it

1:00:13.877 --> 1:00:15.310
loud and clear here.

1:00:15.312 --> 1:00:17.045

1:00:17.047 --> 1:00:18.814

1:00:46.310 --> 1:00:48.844

1:00:48.846 --> 1:00:50.245

1:00:51.315 --> 1:00:54.282

1:01:15.773 --> 1:01:17.973

[tense music]

1:01:28.419 --> 1:01:30.152
So, what just happened?

1:01:32.289 --> 1:01:34.322
I don't understand how
they're not reading this.

1:01:35.092 --> 1:01:36.692
They've got an array
of 50-meter dishes.

1:01:36.694 --> 1:01:37.959
All we've got is
this piddly little thing.

1:01:37.961 --> 1:01:39.227
It doesn't make any sense.

1:01:40.698 --> 1:01:42.330
There's absolutely
no talk of this online?

1:01:42.332 --> 1:01:44.399
Zilch. I mean, are we
the only one's getting this?

1:01:45.335 --> 1:01:47.402
I can't understand how
that could be the case.

1:01:47.404 --> 1:01:48.904
I don't see how that's possible.

1:01:49.473 --> 1:01:50.405
I know.

1:01:51.875 --> 1:01:53.709
The whole world's listening
to this frequency.

1:01:53.711 --> 1:01:55.744
It's almost a cliché that
somethings coming through on it.

1:01:56.780 --> 1:01:58.146
But there is something
coming through?

1:02:07.057 --> 1:02:09.858
and there it is, plain as day.

1:02:11.128 --> 1:02:13.462
There's no two ways about it,
this is an incoming signal.

1:02:14.898 --> 1:02:18.734
Look, forgive
my ignorance here, but before
we get ahead of ourselves,

1:02:18.736 --> 1:02:20.969
can you just explain to me
how this, your message,

1:02:21.872 --> 1:02:24.005
is the same as a signal
from outer space?

1:02:24.775 --> 1:02:26.308
-It could be a leader signal.
-Like a beacon.

1:02:26.310 --> 1:02:27.409
Right, like a beacon.

1:02:27.411 --> 1:02:29.978
Something we'd recognize
that we could latch onto.

1:02:29.980 --> 1:02:31.980
Once we hook on,
there could be more.

1:02:31.982 --> 1:02:35.217
Yeah, but isn't all this just
a little too specific to us?

1:02:35.219 --> 1:02:37.919
I mean, it's almost too good
to be true, not to mention fast.

1:02:37.921 --> 1:02:39.221
You only sent the damn
thing a few hours ago.

1:02:39.223 --> 1:02:40.789

There's a hell of a lot going
on here that I can't explain.

But I can't argue with this.

1:02:54.438 --> 1:02:55.937
You can't argue with this.

1:02:58.976 --> 1:03:00.876
If we are the only ones
getting this...

1:03:02.212 --> 1:03:05.480
and we sit on it, or worse, just
let it slip through the net.

1:03:07.885 --> 1:03:09.918
I'd rather be wrong
and have done the right thing.

1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:12.521
And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
So what?

1:03:15.159 --> 1:03:16.391
But if we're right about this...

1:03:18.862 --> 1:03:22.864
and what's happening here
is what I think
is happening here...

1:03:26.503 --> 1:03:27.903

1:03:31.241 --> 1:03:32.207

1:17:24.207 --> 1:17:25.673
What about your program?

1:17:25.675 --> 1:17:29.143
I mean, yeah, that's fine.
I can reboot the system
from this drive.

1:17:41.824 --> 1:17:42.990
Your system's fine?

1:17:42.992 --> 1:17:44.892
Yeah, well, being powered down

1:17:44.894 --> 1:17:46.894
must have protected it
from the overload.

1:18:07.250 --> 1:18:08.215
That's that then.

1:18:14.724 --> 1:18:16.791
If we can't reacquire
this signal and get some
recordings down,

1:18:16.793 --> 1:18:19.026
we'll have no proof of
anything that's happened here.

1:18:19.796 --> 1:18:21.095
No one's going to believe us.

1:18:23.766 --> 1:18:25.800
It's hard enough to explain
when you can hear
the bloody thing yourself.

1:18:25.802 --> 1:18:27.301
It'll come back through, Mike.

1:18:29.405 --> 1:18:30.905
It'll come back through.

1:18:33.943 --> 1:18:35.443

1:19:22.959 --> 1:19:24.525
[Roy] What are you
doing out here, Mike?

1:19:27.196 --> 1:19:28.162
Nothing.

1:19:35.438 --> 1:19:37.905
I figure there's two
types of scientists, Mike.

1:19:40.209 --> 1:19:41.776
Those that look down at Earth...

1:19:43.045 --> 1:19:45.179
trying to figure out
what's going on here.

1:19:48.184 --> 1:19:50.451
And then there are those
who look up to space...

1:19:52.054 --> 1:19:53.888
searching for
the answers out there.

1:19:56.459 --> 1:19:59.226
But they're both really
looking for the same thing.

1:20:00.863 --> 1:20:01.796
Who are we?

1:20:02.799 --> 1:20:04.031
What are we?

1:20:06.169 --> 1:20:07.368
What does all this mean?

1:20:15.912 --> 1:20:17.011
I'm an engineer, Mike,

1:20:17.914 --> 1:20:20.014
I...

1:20:20.016 --> 1:20:22.216
don't hunt for the science,
I just put it to work.

1:20:25.254 --> 1:20:27.221
But if wasn't
for people like you...

1:20:29.025 --> 1:20:31.091
people who are brave enough
to push the boundaries

1:20:31.093 --> 1:20:32.293
of what we know...

1:20:33.496 --> 1:20:34.829
we'd all stand still.

1:20:39.202 --> 1:20:40.935
[uplifting music]

1:20:42.405 --> 1:20:44.338
I don't know anything
about these signals.

1:20:45.474 --> 1:20:47.408
To me, it's all science fiction.

1:20:49.979 --> 1:20:52.479
But if we're the only people
receiving this signal,

1:20:55.184 --> 1:20:57.952
then we're the only people
that can make sure
the world hears it.

1:21:07.563 --> 1:21:11.065
Because if this
really is first contact

1:21:11.067 --> 1:21:13.634
with an intelligent
extraterrestrial race,

1:21:15.438 --> 1:21:17.071
then we're about to do something

1:21:17.607 --> 1:21:20.241
that humans have dreamt
about since the beginning.

1:21:26.949 --> 1:21:27.882
Mike?

1:21:29.485 --> 1:21:31.018
I'll help you if I can.

1:21:32.321 --> 1:21:34.188
But it's really all on you.

1:21:37.226 --> 1:21:39.260
It's the choice you make
right now that counts.

1:21:41.898 --> 1:21:43.564
You make the right moves here

1:21:45.067 --> 1:21:46.400
and you have in your hands

1:21:47.436 --> 1:21:49.904
the greatest discovery
in the history of mankind.

1:21:51.407 --> 1:21:52.673
The answer to the question.

1:21:54.944 --> 1:21:56.343
The answer to everything.

1:22:09.258 --> 1:22:10.224
Roy...

1:22:11.460 --> 1:22:13.327
-about Goodman.
-Don't worry about that now.

1:22:13.329 --> 1:22:15.095
No, I'm...

1:22:15.097 --> 1:22:16.497
sorry what Astraeus did to you.

1:22:16.499 --> 1:22:18.499
[gentle music]

1:22:18.501 --> 1:22:19.633
Harry told me.

1:22:21.570 --> 1:22:23.170
I wanted to tell you,
I was there...

1:22:24.073 --> 1:22:25.339
at the launch.

1:22:25.341 --> 1:22:30.110
I didn't know what
the project was, I'd only just
joined at the time, but

1:22:30.513 --> 1:22:31.712
I was there.

1:22:33.983 --> 1:22:35.082
It was incredible.

1:22:36.452 --> 1:22:38.652
I've never seen anything
like it. You know, the power...

1:22:40.056 --> 1:22:42.222
I felt it,
it physically shook me.

1:22:44.193 --> 1:22:46.360
I was literally willing
her to go, and she did.

1:22:47.229 --> 1:22:49.129
She punched a hole in the sky.

1:22:52.201 --> 1:22:55.102
You should be so proud of
what you achieved, of Goodman.

1:22:56.305 --> 1:22:58.339
Just 'cause you weren't there,
Roy, doesn't change anything.

1:22:58.341 --> 1:23:00.607
She's yours. No one can
take that away from you.

1:23:04.246 --> 1:23:06.547
But what they did to you,
you didn't deserve that.

1:23:07.583 --> 1:23:08.649
Neither of you did.

1:23:09.986 --> 1:23:11.151
Neither of us?

1:23:11.387 --> 1:23:12.319
You and Harry.

1:23:13.622 --> 1:23:14.755
I can't imagine what
it must have been like

1:23:14.757 --> 1:23:16.357
to lose your jobs like that.

1:23:16.359 --> 1:23:19.226
What are you talking about?
You work under
Harry at Astraeus.

1:23:19.228 --> 1:23:21.028
Not anymore.

1:23:21.030 --> 1:23:22.663
He got the push months ago.
I thought you knew.

1:23:24.767 --> 1:23:27.401
Astraeus fired him. He kicked
up a stink about something.

1:23:30.039 --> 1:23:33.307
[sighs] God, no.
I didn't know that.

1:23:35.144 --> 1:23:37.077
You're more alike
than you think, Roy.

1:23:41.117 --> 1:23:41.933
He's a good friend.

1:23:41.934 --> 1:23:42.750
He just wants you
to be his again.

1:23:51.494 --> 1:23:52.426
Mint?

1:23:52.428 --> 1:23:53.594
[both chuckle]

1:23:57.633 --> 1:23:58.632
Cheers.

1:24:05.041 --> 1:24:06.306
Mike?

1:24:10.613 --> 1:24:12.146
Thank you, Mike.

1:24:33.302 --> 1:24:35.235
[phone ringing]

1:24:36.839 --> 1:24:38.505
Hello?

1:24:38.507 --> 1:24:39.840
Yeah, can I speak
to Dave, please?

1:24:41.110 --> 1:24:43.210
No, I need to speak
to him, really. It's urgent.

1:24:43.212 --> 1:24:46.113
[Mike]<i> Yeah. Yeah, I called</i>
<i>earlier, and you put me through.</i>

1:24:47.149 --> 1:24:49.149
<i> Well, yeah, I understand that,</i>
<i> but if you--</i>

1:24:49.819 --> 1:24:52.386
<i> Yeah, but if you'd just let me</i>
<i> explain to him them I could--</i>

1:24:53.155 --> 1:24:55.089
<i>Yeah, yeah, I understand that--</i>

1:24:56.125 --> 1:24:58.225
No, I realize that,
but if you could just
let me explain it to him,

1:24:58.227 --> 1:24:59.860
then I reckon
he'll be able to speak.

1:25:00.763 --> 1:25:04.198
[Harry]
<i>¶ Uncle Rat, he wanted a wife ¶</i>

1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:05.699
[Harry humming]

1:25:05.701 --> 1:25:07.134
<i> ¶ Carry me home ¶</i>

1:25:07.136 --> 1:25:09.203
[Harry humming]

1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:14.174
<i> ¶ Dum dum da da da,</i>
<i> Carry me home ¶</i>

1:25:16.779 --> 1:25:18.245
Why didn't you tell me?

1:25:20.749 --> 1:25:22.416
Mike let that one slip then?

1:25:25.287 --> 1:25:26.720
What the hell happened, Harry?

1:25:30.126 --> 1:25:31.525
I didn't want
to make things worse.

1:25:43.139 --> 1:25:44.671
Come on, Roy.

1:25:44.673 --> 1:25:46.206
You know there's been
this friction about

1:25:46.208 --> 1:25:47.774
you being fired
and me staying on.

1:25:49.879 --> 1:25:51.745
I didn't want to make
you feel guilty as well.

1:25:55.317 --> 1:25:56.350
Guilty?

1:25:56.719 --> 1:25:57.784
Guilty about what, Harry?

1:25:57.786 --> 1:25:58.719
Why did they fire you?

1:25:59.522 --> 1:26:00.721
They didn't fire me.

1:26:01.790 --> 1:26:03.390
No, I--

1:26:03.392 --> 1:26:04.658
I quit.

1:26:06.795 --> 1:26:08.562
I didn't agree with
how they treated you.

1:26:09.398 --> 1:26:11.198
And I got on the wrong side
of the decision-makers.

1:26:11.200 --> 1:26:12.699
So, they basically said
they couldn't care less

1:26:12.701 --> 1:26:13.834
who worked for them.

1:26:14.770 --> 1:26:15.769
So...

1:26:16.472 --> 1:26:17.538
I quit.

1:26:17.540 --> 1:26:18.906
[somber music]

1:26:22.211 --> 1:26:23.510
I'm not going to
push forward some company

1:26:23.512 --> 1:26:25.312
that doesn't value
its people, Roy.

1:26:27.583 --> 1:26:28.649
What were you thinking, Harry?

1:26:28.651 --> 1:26:29.683
I don't care.

1:26:29.685 --> 1:26:33.453
Anyway, I'm back with the uni's
research group now, so.

1:26:36.258 --> 1:26:37.291
I had no idea.

1:26:37.293 --> 1:26:40.561
Oh, it's not so bad for me.
I'm a scientist,

1:26:40.563 --> 1:26:41.662
I belong in a lab anyway.

1:26:41.664 --> 1:26:43.230
[Harry chuckles]

1:26:44.433 --> 1:26:46.200
Besides, it's you
I'm worried about, Roy.

1:26:46.602 --> 1:26:48.335
Working for ENSAT
and the Goodman project,

1:26:48.337 --> 1:26:49.536
it meant everything to you.

1:26:50.206 --> 1:26:51.572
It meant everything
to both of us.

1:26:51.574 --> 1:26:53.674
Honestly, I'm fine.
It's all fine.

1:26:53.676 --> 1:26:55.275
No, Harry.

1:26:55.277 --> 1:26:56.276
It's not fine.

1:26:58.380 --> 1:27:00.514
This whole time
I've not able to let go.

1:27:02.851 --> 1:27:04.751
And I've been
ignoring our friendship.

1:27:06.388 --> 1:27:08.288
You've been trying to help me
and not once did it occur to me

1:27:08.290 --> 1:27:10.390
that you may have been
affected by what happened.

1:27:12.294 --> 1:27:14.361
-It's okay.
-No, Harry. It's not okay.

1:27:16.899 --> 1:27:20.300
I'm sorry you lost
your job because of me,

1:27:20.302 --> 1:27:22.436
and I'm sorry
I've treated you this way.

1:27:23.806 --> 1:27:25.639
-If I'd known--
-Roy.

1:27:27.243 --> 1:27:29.276
Look, what we're
doing tonight...

1:27:30.679 --> 1:27:32.279
out in the field as mates...

1:27:34.850 --> 1:27:37.584
this... right now...

1:27:39.688 --> 1:27:40.921
This is what it's about.

1:27:42.825 --> 1:27:44.291
Not some job.

1:27:54.370 --> 1:27:55.836
[Harry chuckles]

1:28:00.843 --> 1:28:02.409
It's a shame
you don't have yours.

1:28:06.582 --> 1:28:08.615
I thought you said
you didn't bring it?

1:28:11.654 --> 1:28:12.953
I said I wasn't
going to wear it.

1:28:15.858 --> 1:28:18.292
With Goodman,
I was part of a team.

1:28:18.894 --> 1:28:19.993
And I lost that.

1:28:19.995 --> 1:28:23.497
But I now realize I've always
been a part of this team.

1:28:25.801 --> 1:28:27.701
[uplifting music]

1:28:31.807 --> 1:28:33.740
Right, let's get to work.

1:28:35.511 --> 1:28:37.044
Don't you start
bossing me around now.

1:28:37.579 --> 1:28:39.513
Well, I am the head
of the Astro-Nuts.

1:28:39.515 --> 1:28:40.881
Head of the Astro--

1:28:40.883 --> 1:28:42.316
That's not funny, Harry.

1:28:43.819 --> 1:28:45.619
Harry? Let's talk about this.

1:28:46.689 --> 1:28:49.056
Harry? I thought I was
the head Astro-Nut?

1:28:49.058 --> 1:28:51.024
You were, but you
were gone so long

1:28:51.026 --> 1:28:54.394
-the board voted you out.
-The board?

1:28:54.396 --> 1:28:57.097
Harry, there's only three
members, how is that a board?

1:28:58.400 --> 1:29:00.500
Clearly, we both deemed
you unworthy of the title.

1:29:03.372 --> 1:29:05.739
Well, who put you
in charge then?

1:29:05.741 --> 1:29:08.642
We had a vote. Naturally
everyone voted for themselves,

1:29:08.644 --> 1:29:10.444
so we had to draw straws, but...

1:29:11.747 --> 1:29:12.846
I won.

1:29:13.649 --> 1:29:14.848
That's so you.

1:29:14.850 --> 1:29:17.851
Nice hats. Look, right,
I'm just on the phone to Dave,

1:29:17.853 --> 1:29:20.520
not a happy chap.
Anyway, nothing, not a peep,

1:29:20.522 --> 1:29:22.723
Look, apparently, we've
got some telemetry dropout
from a few satellites.

1:29:22.725 --> 1:29:24.691
-Goodman.
-Right.

1:29:24.693 --> 1:29:26.126
Look, I dunno what it means,
but we can't rule anything out

1:29:26.128 --> 1:29:27.694
as coincidence.
When's she due to pass

1:29:27.696 --> 1:29:29.629
-over again?
-Eight minutes.

1:29:29.631 --> 1:29:31.631
Okay. Well, let's get on it.

1:29:31.633 --> 1:29:33.133
There's something going on here
guys I reckon we've got the jump

1:29:33.135 --> 1:29:34.735
on everyone else.
Harry, go fire up the scope.

1:29:34.737 --> 1:29:38.038
Absolutely. That's more like it.

1:29:38.040 --> 1:29:39.906
[Mike] Yep, we're going to have
to speak to you later, Dave.

1:29:39.908 --> 1:29:41.441
-[Dave]<i> Yeah, great.</i>
-Yeah.

1:29:41.443 --> 1:29:43.443

-Yeah.

[uplifting music]

1:30:20.949 --> 1:30:21.948
Now, we're talking.

1:30:22.785 --> 1:30:25.519
Right, chief. Let's do this.

1:30:25.521 --> 1:30:27.087
[dramatic music]

1:30:29.892 --> 1:30:32.492
[clock ticking]

1:30:33.595 --> 1:30:35.162
-One minute!
-One minute!

[Roy] Come on, load
the last recording.

1:30:37.866 --> 1:30:39.633
[Mike] Okay,
I've got it, here it is.

1:30:45.174 --> 1:30:46.573
I need some numbers, Roy.

1:30:46.575 --> 1:30:47.841
I know, I know.

1:30:47.843 --> 1:30:49.109
Come on, come on, fast forward.

1:30:50.879 --> 1:30:51.812
There.

1:30:54.616 --> 1:30:55.549
I told you.

1:31:09.031 --> 1:31:10.163
Numbers?

1:31:10.165 --> 1:31:11.865
We've got 30 seconds, guys.

1:31:11.867 --> 1:31:13.934
Elevation, 18 degrees,
south by south-east.

1:31:15.237 --> 1:31:17.170
18 degrees, south, southeast?

1:31:17.172 --> 1:31:18.939
Bearing, one-five-niner.

1:31:18.941 --> 1:31:20.607
One-five-niner.

1:31:20.609 --> 1:31:21.908
20 seconds!

1:31:26.181 --> 1:31:27.747
Scope set, we're rolling.

1:31:27.749 --> 1:31:29.149
Ten seconds, here she comes.

1:31:29.952 --> 1:31:31.718
Keep your eyes peeled, boys.

1:31:33.922 --> 1:31:35.121

1:31:57.913 --> 1:31:59.212
[soft tense music]

1:32:28.644 --> 1:32:29.743
Hold that position.

1:32:34.149 --> 1:32:35.115
I told you.

1:32:36.051 --> 1:32:37.284
What did I tell you, huh?

1:32:38.120 --> 1:32:40.120
What in God's name
is going on here?

1:32:44.192 --> 1:32:45.125
Sky map.

1:32:47.763 --> 1:32:49.763
Mike, your sky map.

1:32:51.633 --> 1:32:52.666
Sky map?

1:32:56.104 --> 1:32:58.138
No, the image from
your system earlier.

1:32:58.140 --> 1:33:00.273
It's gone,
his hard-drive's fried.

1:33:00.876 --> 1:33:02.676
-Damn it.
-Well, look, I lost
the one from earlier,

1:33:02.678 --> 1:33:04.945
-but I can
run the program again.
-Do it.

1:33:04.947 --> 1:33:07.747
-Do you remember it doesn't
work properly, right?
-Do it.

1:33:09.718 --> 1:33:10.817
Okay.

1:33:11.687 --> 1:33:13.653
[machine whirring]

1:33:16.358 --> 1:33:18.291
[Roy] There.

1:33:18.293 --> 1:33:19.759
That.

1:33:19.761 --> 1:33:20.894
Yeah, what about it?

1:33:21.830 --> 1:33:23.296
What if this is
no system glitch?

1:33:25.200 --> 1:33:27.734
What if your program
works perfectly?

1:33:28.370 --> 1:33:29.869
And this...

1:33:30.906 --> 1:33:32.138
this is no error.

1:33:35.143 --> 1:33:37.844
What if this,
whatever this is...

1:33:39.348 --> 1:33:41.181
is what's blocking
the satellites?

1:33:45.220 --> 1:33:47.354
You said yourself your program
is looking straight up

1:33:48.156 --> 1:33:51.391
and that should not be there.

1:33:51.393 --> 1:33:53.793
[dramatic music]

1:33:56.298 --> 1:33:57.998
Harry, has your
scope got infrared?

1:33:59.935 --> 1:34:01.368
Yeah.

1:34:01.370 --> 1:34:02.836
Yeah, it does.

1:34:17.419 --> 1:34:18.385
That's not right.

1:34:19.688 --> 1:34:22.255
Space should read
as dark red in IR mode.

1:34:22.257 --> 1:34:23.823
Black is wrong.

1:34:24.393 --> 1:34:26.693
There's nothing there,
there's not even stars.

1:34:28.296 --> 1:34:29.896
Wait, Harry, stop.

1:34:29.898 --> 1:34:31.264
[soft tense music]

1:34:34.169 --> 1:34:35.301
Pan right.

1:34:45.047 --> 1:34:45.979
Stop.

1:35:09.705 --> 1:35:10.704
Zoom out.

1:35:13.408 --> 1:35:14.407
Keep coming.

1:35:22.084 --> 1:35:24.017
There's something up there.

1:35:24.986 --> 1:35:26.052
Oh, my God.

1:35:50.979 --> 1:35:52.946
[dramatic music]

1:35:59.154 --> 1:36:00.954
I don't believe it.

1:36:02.524 --> 1:36:04.324
I do not believe it.

1:36:22.511 --> 1:36:24.043
It's been there all night.

1:36:25.347 --> 1:36:27.013
Right above us.

1:36:28.950 --> 1:36:30.884
You are recording this right?

1:36:40.162 --> 1:36:41.094
Roy?

1:36:42.030 --> 1:36:43.296
Roy, get a load of this.

1:36:49.237 --> 1:36:50.503
I can't see anything.

1:36:59.948 --> 1:37:01.214
Well, it's no wonder.

1:37:01.883 --> 1:37:03.883
Whatever it is,
it isn't reading on the scope

1:37:03.885 --> 1:37:06.219
in the visible spectrum, but in
infrared it's crystal clear.

1:37:07.455 --> 1:37:09.422
Yeah, and I'm getting
a strong radio signature.

1:37:10.525 --> 1:37:12.258
Christ.

1:37:12.260 --> 1:37:13.560
Do we report this?

1:37:14.262 --> 1:37:15.995
I wouldn't know what to report.

1:37:15.997 --> 1:37:20.099
Well, surely, if it's visible
through infrared, NASA's
got to be picking it up.

1:37:20.101 --> 1:37:21.601
Probably.

1:37:21.603 --> 1:37:23.336
To be honest,
anyone with an infrared scope

1:37:23.338 --> 1:37:25.471
would be able to see this,
but you know,

1:37:25.473 --> 1:37:27.473
it's not exactly drawing
attention to itself.

1:37:28.610 --> 1:37:30.443
It's got to be a couple
of hundred meters wide,

1:37:30.445 --> 1:37:32.478
probably about the size
of a football stadium,

1:37:33.148 --> 1:37:35.048
and although, yeah,
that's pretty big,

1:37:35.584 --> 1:37:37.550
compared to the rest
of the sky it's pretty small.

1:37:38.854 --> 1:37:41.454
Unless you were combing
systematically across
the whole sky,

1:37:41.456 --> 1:37:43.122
you'd easily miss it,
look, watch.

1:37:51.366 --> 1:37:53.566
It's basically
a shadow in space.

1:37:54.603 --> 1:37:57.036
Pretty hard to see
shadows in the dark.

1:38:03.912 --> 1:38:05.912
I never would've believed it.

1:38:09.918 --> 1:38:11.517
[machine beeping]

1:38:23.899 --> 1:38:25.231
What the hell?

1:38:28.904 --> 1:38:30.069
What is that?

1:38:37.612 --> 1:38:39.045
I mean, that's sound.

1:38:40.048 --> 1:38:41.614
It's real time imaging,
it works.

1:38:42.350 --> 1:38:44.684
Look, my system works,
it actually works.

1:38:44.686 --> 1:38:47.053
[all laughing]

1:38:47.055 --> 1:38:48.388
[patterned beeping]

1:38:48.957 --> 1:38:49.956
No.

1:39:01.036 --> 1:39:02.535
It's the source of the signal.

1:39:05.340 --> 1:39:07.073
Look, it's transmitting,
I mean, these pulses,

1:39:07.075 --> 1:39:09.108
they sync with the clicks
coming through the tuner.

1:39:09.711 --> 1:39:11.277
-It wasn't a bounce back at all.
-No.

1:39:11.279 --> 1:39:13.179
It was being broadcast
from orbit.

1:39:15.183 --> 1:39:16.449
Sounds like Morse Code.

1:39:19.587 --> 1:39:20.520
No.

1:39:21.723 --> 1:39:23.022
No, it's binary.

1:39:30.565 --> 1:39:32.365
Yeah, it's binary.

1:39:36.671 --> 1:39:38.037
It's got to be a loop pattern.

1:39:38.038 --> 1:39:39.404
-Is it random?
-Non-random,
binary is never random.

1:39:42.711 --> 1:39:46.012
-Why are they
transmitting binary?
-Out of pure logic.

1:39:46.014 --> 1:39:49.082
Maths is the language
of the universe,
no translation required.

1:39:49.084 --> 1:39:52.251
Yeah, two plus two
will always equal four
no matter where you come from.

1:39:52.253 --> 1:39:55.021
If an alien civilization is
intelligent enough to transmit,

1:39:55.023 --> 1:39:56.990
let alone travel through space,
then they need maths.

1:39:56.992 --> 1:39:59.058
Yeah, and if another
civilization is advanced enough

1:39:59.060 --> 1:40:01.160
to intercept this signal, then

1:40:04.265 --> 1:40:05.348
they'll definitely know maths.

1:40:05.349 --> 1:40:06.432
But surely, they're more
advanced than simple binary?

1:40:06.434 --> 1:40:08.267
Substantially, yeah,
but they don't know we are.

1:40:08.269 --> 1:40:10.036
It's the best way
to make first contact.

1:40:10.438 --> 1:40:12.372
And maths is common ground.

1:40:16.311 --> 1:40:18.411
You know what else
is binary, don't you?

1:40:20.281 --> 1:40:22.448
-Arecibo.
-Arecibo.

1:40:24.486 --> 1:40:26.252
This is insane.

1:40:26.254 --> 1:40:28.221
Look, tell him about Arecibo.

1:40:28.223 --> 1:40:30.623
Okay, Roy, get this,
in the '70s,

1:40:30.625 --> 1:40:32.692
a binary message was
broadcast into space

1:40:32.694 --> 1:40:35.194
from the Arecibo
Observatory in Puerto Rico.

1:40:35.196 --> 1:40:37.363
1,679 digits, right?

1:40:37.365 --> 1:40:38.798
Yeah, yeah, yeah
something like that,
but it was never really

1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:40.433
a serious attempt
to make contact.

1:40:40.435 --> 1:40:41.701
No, not really,

1:40:41.703 --> 1:40:43.069
its purpose was to demonstrate

1:40:43.071 --> 1:40:44.570
the telescope's capabilities.

1:40:45.673 --> 1:40:47.173
I mean, they were aiming
it at a star system

1:40:47.175 --> 1:40:49.042
that was 25,000
light years away.

1:40:49.044 --> 1:40:50.676
That's 50,000 years
for a reply at best.

1:40:51.679 --> 1:40:53.279
Well, you're going to
run up a hell of a bill

1:40:53.281 --> 1:40:54.781
-being kept on hold that long.
-Yeah.

1:40:56.518 --> 1:40:58.217
It could have been intercepted.

1:41:00.488 --> 1:41:01.587
It's a possibility.

1:41:03.792 --> 1:41:05.324
I think everything's just moved

1:41:05.326 --> 1:41:07.560
from a possibility
to a probability.

1:41:22.777 --> 1:41:24.143
What did you say it was?

1:41:24.145 --> 1:41:25.144
1,600 and?

1:41:25.146 --> 1:41:26.179
79.

1:41:26.181 --> 1:41:27.647
[gentle music]

1:41:43.665 --> 1:41:45.431
[machine beeping]

1:41:52.774 --> 1:41:54.240
1,679.

1:41:56.678 --> 1:41:58.244
[dramatic music]

1:42:08.156 --> 1:42:09.489
Can you decode on that?

1:42:10.658 --> 1:42:11.624
Silly question.

1:42:17.398 --> 1:42:19.899
Do you have a copy of
the original Arecibo message?

1:42:20.835 --> 1:42:22.502
Again, silly question.

1:42:23.872 --> 1:42:26.739
The Arecibo is
a simple binary code,

1:42:27.308 --> 1:42:29.542
when arranged correctly,
it reveals...

1:42:33.381 --> 1:42:34.264
this.

1:42:34.265 --> 1:42:35.148
This is what
the original looked like.

1:42:35.783 --> 1:42:38.784
It's a visual message
containing basic information

1:42:38.786 --> 1:42:40.720
about humans
and life on our planet.

1:42:41.656 --> 1:42:45.191
Earth biochemicals, the formula
for DNA, that sort of thing.

1:42:46.161 --> 1:42:49.328
If I remember correctly,
it's 73 columns wide

1:42:50.231 --> 1:42:51.898
with 21 digits in each.

1:42:52.433 --> 1:42:54.200
Arrange the incoming
signal like that,

1:42:54.202 --> 1:42:55.501
let's see what we get.

1:43:00.875 --> 1:43:03.376
[dramatic music]

1:43:10.451 --> 1:43:11.817
I don't believe this.

1:43:12.954 --> 1:43:14.820
It's Arecibo all right.

1:43:15.690 --> 1:43:18.858
See, the base-10's
is exactly the same
as the original. We've got

1:43:19.928 --> 1:43:21.928
carbon-based biochemistry,

1:43:21.930 --> 1:43:24.363
DNA nucleotides,
the double-helix,

1:43:24.365 --> 1:43:25.665
it's all there.

1:43:35.276 --> 1:43:36.642
Wait...

1:43:38.313 --> 1:43:39.545
There are differences here.

1:43:40.882 --> 1:43:42.415
Where?

1:43:42.417 --> 1:43:43.683
Look.

1:43:44.385 --> 1:43:45.851
Subtle but significant.

1:43:54.662 --> 1:43:55.828
Why is it doing that?

1:44:04.372 --> 1:44:05.671
It's not Arecibo.

1:44:08.543 --> 1:44:10.009
It's a response to Arecibo.

1:44:10.011 --> 1:44:12.445
[dramatic music intensifies]

1:44:17.919 --> 1:44:19.285
It's almost identical.

1:44:20.755 --> 1:44:21.854
Meaning?

1:44:27.996 --> 1:44:30.663
Meaning we're
of common cosmic origin.

1:44:43.711 --> 1:44:44.644
My God.

1:44:52.387 --> 1:44:53.953
[machine beeping]

1:44:55.556 --> 1:44:56.622
No.

1:44:58.059 --> 1:44:59.825
No, no, no, I'm losing power.

1:44:59.827 --> 1:45:02.361
-What?
-Look, my batteries
are dying here.

1:45:02.363 --> 1:45:04.630
Jesus, Roy, I thought
you designed these things
to last all night?

1:45:04.632 --> 1:45:06.299
For two systems, Harry.
We're running three here,

1:45:06.301 --> 1:45:07.733
plus your scope
and these aerials.

1:45:07.735 --> 1:45:09.702
If we lose power,
we lose everything.

1:45:09.704 --> 1:45:11.837
-What do you mean,
we lose everything?
-The recordings.

1:45:11.839 --> 1:45:14.573
My hard drive's fried, remember.
We got no long-term memory.

1:45:15.877 --> 1:45:17.076
[Roy] Christ.

1:45:19.314 --> 1:45:21.047
Look, my system can only
hold data while it's running.

1:45:21.049 --> 1:45:21.981
Use my drive.

1:45:21.983 --> 1:45:25.451
This transfer is going
to take time and guzzle power.

1:45:25.453 --> 1:45:27.320
If we can't get the files across
before I lose that power,

1:45:27.322 --> 1:45:28.587
then the system will die.

1:45:29.924 --> 1:45:32.625
-We'll lose the recordings.
-Jesus.

1:45:32.627 --> 1:45:34.627
Roy, pull the plugs on
everything you've got
in the back.

1:45:34.629 --> 1:45:35.761
Got it.

1:45:42.770 --> 1:45:44.837
Come on, come on, come on.

1:45:45.440 --> 1:45:46.739
Roy, pull it.

1:45:52.647 --> 1:45:54.580
Look, we've got 18 minutes,
that's not going to be enough.

1:45:54.582 --> 1:45:55.715
Do you have any spare batteries?

1:45:55.717 --> 1:45:58.051
I don't know, do we?
You guys packed the car.

1:45:58.052 --> 1:46:00.386
-I didn't pack 'em.
-You mean you
packed all this,

1:46:00.388 --> 1:46:01.620
and didn't think
to bring some more batteries?

1:46:01.622 --> 1:46:03.122
Harry, we've got
a serious problem here.

1:46:03.124 --> 1:46:04.657
We've got more than a problem.

1:46:04.659 --> 1:46:05.825
What do you want me to do, Mike?

1:46:05.827 --> 1:46:07.460
We've got no spare batteries.

1:46:07.462 --> 1:46:08.861
[dramatic music]

1:46:12.367 --> 1:46:13.833
What do you want to do, Mike?

1:46:13.835 --> 1:46:15.685
Well, listen,
I've got some power units
back at the station.

1:46:15.686 --> 1:46:17.536
-We got to go.
-We'll never make it.

1:46:17.538 --> 1:46:18.838
Look, we don't have a choice.

1:46:19.440 --> 1:46:20.773
We might be the only
ones getting this data,

1:46:20.775 --> 1:46:21.907
and if we want to save
these recordings,

1:46:21.909 --> 1:46:23.376
we got to do something.

1:46:23.378 --> 1:46:24.744
We've got 18 minutes.

1:46:25.546 --> 1:46:27.580
If we're going to go,
we've got to go right now.

1:46:27.582 --> 1:46:29.915
-Mike, we'll never make it.
-We can make it.

1:46:31.519 --> 1:46:32.685
I'll get you there.

1:46:34.589 --> 1:46:36.122
Tell me what to do.

1:46:39.894 --> 1:46:41.827
Okay, okay, let's do it.

1:46:42.430 --> 1:46:44.397
We'll get the gear,
you cut loose what you can.

1:46:44.766 --> 1:46:45.931
Wait, Harry!

1:46:45.933 --> 1:46:47.867
What if there's more to come?

1:46:47.869 --> 1:46:49.769
If I pull the transmission,
we'll miss it.

1:46:49.771 --> 1:46:51.570
Look, we've got
to kill it anyway.

1:46:51.572 --> 1:46:53.439
We can't move the vehicle
with the aerials deployed.

1:46:53.441 --> 1:46:55.674
It's better to save what
you've got than lose the lot.

1:47:03.518 --> 1:47:05.151
I can't believe
I'm going to do this.

1:47:05.153 --> 1:47:06.919
[dramatic music]

1:47:12.593 --> 1:47:14.460
[tense music]

1:47:19.667 --> 1:47:21.600
Roy, grab the aerials,
I've got the scope.

1:47:21.602 --> 1:47:22.902
I'm on it.

1:47:35.116 --> 1:47:36.649
Come on, come on.

1:47:36.651 --> 1:47:40.653
-How we looking?
-Transfer's going, but
it is drinking power, okay?

1:47:40.655 --> 1:47:42.588
-we don't have much time.
-This is going to be tight.

1:47:42.590 --> 1:47:44.523
[Mike] Be as quick
as you can, Roy!

1:47:45.526 --> 1:47:47.460
Harry, get your gear loaded,
and get the car started.

1:47:47.462 --> 1:47:49.061
I'm on it.

1:47:50.731 --> 1:47:52.097
Come on, come on, get
that thing in here.

1:47:52.099 --> 1:47:53.599
Hang on, I need
to get the tripod.

1:47:54.669 --> 1:47:56.235
Bloody tripod.

1:47:56.237 --> 1:47:57.770
[dramatic music]

1:48:25.867 --> 1:48:26.966
Key.

1:48:28.035 --> 1:48:28.968
Mike, where's the key?

1:48:28.970 --> 1:48:30.069
I don't have it,

1:48:30.071 --> 1:48:31.737
why would I have it?

1:48:32.807 --> 1:48:34.240
Where's the key?

1:48:43.851 --> 1:48:45.551
Where the hell is Roy?

1:48:47.054 --> 1:48:48.954
Harry, get this car started.

1:48:48.956 --> 1:48:50.589
Key, give me the key!

1:48:50.591 --> 1:48:51.857
Damn it.

1:48:54.161 --> 1:48:55.928
Mike, get this gear
loaded and ready to go.

1:48:55.930 --> 1:48:57.196
Yeah.

1:49:03.137 --> 1:49:04.770
[engine stuttering]

1:49:05.873 --> 1:49:07.206
No, no, no, no, no.

1:49:07.208 --> 1:49:08.741
Come on, come on.

1:49:17.552 --> 1:49:18.617
Come on.

1:49:19.654 --> 1:49:20.653
Come on!

1:49:22.990 --> 1:49:24.156
Eight percent.

1:49:28.896 --> 1:49:29.729
Come on, come on, hurry.

1:49:29.730 --> 1:49:30.563
[Roy] Harry,
get this car started!

1:49:30.565 --> 1:49:32.798
-It won't start!
-We got to go, guys.

1:49:32.800 --> 1:49:34.099
Let me try.

1:49:38.673 --> 1:49:40.105
-Come on.
-[engine stuttering]

1:49:48.249 --> 1:49:49.982
Come on, Roy. Come on, Roy.

1:49:50.718 --> 1:49:51.951
Come on.

1:49:54.889 --> 1:49:56.055
Come on.

1:49:57.959 --> 1:49:59.658
Come on, get it started, Roy.

1:49:59.660 --> 1:50:00.859
Come on, start.

1:50:03.064 --> 1:50:04.129
Come on.

1:50:05.366 --> 1:50:06.932
[engine revving]

1:50:07.802 --> 1:50:10.636
[all laughing]

1:50:10.638 --> 1:50:11.670
Well done.

1:50:11.672 --> 1:50:12.938
Mike, get in!

1:50:13.608 --> 1:50:14.607
It won't fit.

1:50:14.609 --> 1:50:17.610
I can't get
the scope to fit, Harry.

1:50:17.612 --> 1:50:18.844
She'll fit, Mike.
You're not doing it right.

1:50:18.846 --> 1:50:20.913
-Leave it.
-What?

1:50:20.915 --> 1:50:22.247
We're running out of time.

1:50:22.249 --> 1:50:25.851
-No, she'll fit.
-Harry there's no time
for this, come on.

1:50:25.853 --> 1:50:27.853
-Get back in the car.
-She'll fit,
she'll fit, she'll fit.

1:50:27.855 --> 1:50:28.854
This is ridiculous.

1:50:30.625 --> 1:50:33.158
I'm sorry, Harry.
She's not going to fit.

1:50:34.362 --> 1:50:36.161
Come on, Annabelle,
get in the car.

1:50:36.163 --> 1:50:37.997
Harry, get back in the car,
we've got to go now.

1:50:37.999 --> 1:50:39.865
Come on, we've got 12 minutes,
we've got to go.

1:50:39.867 --> 1:50:41.400
Just exactly how it was.

1:50:41.402 --> 1:50:43.235
-We haven't got time for this.
-What are you doing,

1:50:43.237 --> 1:50:46.205
-just get in the car.
-Just over here.

1:50:46.207 --> 1:50:47.139
Harry!

1:50:48.309 --> 1:50:49.742
You've got to leave her.

1:50:51.412 --> 1:50:52.378
We got to go.

1:50:52.913 --> 1:50:54.179
[Harry sighs]
