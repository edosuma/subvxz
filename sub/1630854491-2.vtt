WEBVTT

00:06.089 --> 00:07.257
(grunts in effort)

00:07.298 --> 00:08.758
-(screams, grunts)
-(snarling)

00:10.802 --> 00:13.221
(snoring)

00:13.263 --> 00:15.432
Hey, Grug. How's it going?

00:15.473 --> 00:17.017
(growls, sniffs)

00:17.058 --> 00:18.935
-Is-is that berry cake? Mm!

00:18.977 --> 00:20.353
-Still hot from the
fire. Want some?

00:20.395 --> 00:22.647
I know how much you like cake,
so I asked Hope

00:22.689 --> 00:25.358
how to make one, but
she wouldn't tell.
So I had to hide and watch her.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.694
Uh, I may have been a smidge
ambitious on the berries, but...

00:27.736 --> 00:30.864
And he's gone.

00:30.905 --> 00:32.699
Wanna toss the old throw-go-nut
around?

00:32.741 --> 00:35.660
Forget our differences,
make some memories? Mm?

00:35.702 --> 00:37.704
-Uh, sure. Go deep.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.539
(panting)

00:39.581 --> 00:40.498
Deeper!

00:40.540 --> 00:41.708
(panting)

00:41.750 --> 00:42.709
Deeper!

00:42.751 --> 00:45.628
(panting)

00:45.670 --> 00:47.088
GUY: I'm open!

00:47.589 --> 00:48.840
(grunts)

00:50.675 --> 00:51.843
(Grug grunting)

00:51.885 --> 00:54.596
Digging hard or hardly digging?
Am I right?

00:54.637 --> 00:55.889
(growls)

00:55.930 --> 00:57.599
Well, if-if you need a hand,
just let me know.

00:57.640 --> 01:01.227
-Ooh! Can you climb down there
to see how deep the well is?

01:01.269 --> 01:02.854
-Consider it done!

01:02.896 --> 01:04.397
* *

01:04.439 --> 01:08.109
I mean, I'm still going down,
so it's pretty deep, and...

01:09.944 --> 01:12.405
You left, didn't you?

01:12.447 --> 01:15.367
<i>Let's live wild, the</i>
<i>world's our own</i>

01:15.408 --> 01:17.827
<i>We built this wheel</i>
<i>now it's gunna roll</i>

01:17.869 --> 01:22.290
<i>You know a spark</i>
<i>becomes a fire wherever we go</i>

01:23.833 --> 01:24.959
<i>Whoa-ho-ho</i>

01:25.001 --> 01:27.253
<i>Stuck together,</i>
<i>stuck, stuck together</i>

01:27.295 --> 01:30.340
<i>It's an evolution</i>
<i>for worse or for better</i>

01:30.382 --> 01:33.510
<i>To find some unity</i>

01:33.551 --> 01:36.054
<i>For all humanity</i>

01:36.096 --> 01:37.972
<i>Because we're stuck together</i>

01:38.014 --> 01:40.266
<i>In one big family tree</i>

01:41.893 --> 01:42.852
(insects chirping)

01:42.894 --> 01:45.814
* *

01:45.855 --> 01:47.273
(grunting)

01:47.315 --> 01:48.942
-He just doesn't like me.

01:48.983 --> 01:51.820
-Not true, Guy-baby.
He likes you.

01:51.861 --> 01:52.821
-I don't like him.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.072
-Dad.
-I'm kidding!

01:54.114 --> 01:55.865
(quietly) No, I'm not.

01:55.907 --> 01:59.285
-So, I think I should
try to bond
with your dad another time.

01:59.327 --> 02:00.995
-Yeah. Like now.
-Or never.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.747
-Dad!
-Kidding again!

02:02.789 --> 02:05.834
-(quietly) Not kidding.
-Or I should just give up.

02:05.875 --> 02:08.294
-We can't give up.
-You should definitely give up.

02:08.336 --> 02:11.589
-Dad!
-It's a joke! Why else
would I say that?

02:11.631 --> 02:15.301
-(quietly) Because I mean it.
-Uh...

02:15.343 --> 02:17.846
-Why does Dad hate Guy so much?
-Oh, honey,

02:17.887 --> 02:21.141
your father likes Guy.
He just doesn't know
he likes Guy.

02:21.182 --> 02:23.143
So you'll have to make
him like Guy.

02:23.184 --> 02:25.478
-How do I do that?
-Cucumbeet pie.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.857
<i>When we first got to the farm,</i>
<i>your dad hated cucumbeets,</i>

02:28.898 --> 02:31.151
<i>but he loved pie.</i>

02:31.192 --> 02:32.569
(loud eating)

02:32.610 --> 02:35.363
<i>So, I just kept hiding</i>
<i>cucumbeets inside his pies</i>

02:35.405 --> 02:38.116
<i>until he realized</i>
<i>he actually liked cucumbeets.</i>

02:38.158 --> 02:39.826
(loud eating)

02:39.868 --> 02:43.621
-So, you're saying I should
hide Guy in one of Dad's pies?

02:43.663 --> 02:46.499
-No. I'm saying you take
something your dad loves

02:46.541 --> 02:48.918
-and add a little Guy.
-Hm...

02:48.960 --> 02:51.004
(Grug humming)

02:51.046 --> 02:53.340
-Hey, Dad. Up for
a little hunting?

02:53.381 --> 02:55.175
-(grunts) I'm always
up for hunting,

02:55.216 --> 02:57.177
especially with you!
(goat-like scream)

02:57.218 --> 03:00.472
-If we hurry, we can
catch the bearacudas
before their afternoon nap.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.182
You know what I always say...

03:02.223 --> 03:03.683
-Eat first, ask questions later?

03:03.725 --> 03:08.146
-Yes... and a tired bearacuda
is an angry bearacuda.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.023
And angry is fun to hunt.

03:10.065 --> 03:12.317
You know what? Forget
the spears!

03:12.359 --> 03:13.860
We're hunting with these.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.820
-Whip-zips?! Nice.

03:15.862 --> 03:19.407
-Yeah, these babies take real
skill. Remember when I taught
you to use them?

03:19.449 --> 03:22.035
And now, you're a better shot
than your old man.

03:22.077 --> 03:24.454
-I learned from the best.
-Aw...

03:24.496 --> 03:26.873
You know the only thing
I like more than hunting?

03:26.915 --> 03:29.125
-Mom?
-Uh... yes.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.127
I was gonna say that for sure.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.129
And hunting with you.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.964
-That's exactly what
I wanted to hear.

03:35.006 --> 03:37.884
Oh. Also, Guy's coming
hunting with us.
'Kay, bye! (panting)

03:37.926 --> 03:40.095
-What?! Why Guy?!

03:40.136 --> 03:42.013
(echoing) <i>Why?!</i>

03:42.055 --> 03:44.724
GUY: I still can't believe your
dad, lots of anger issues,

03:44.766 --> 03:47.686
invited me, person he hates,
to go hunting,

03:47.727 --> 03:49.562
his favorite thing
to do, with him!

03:49.604 --> 03:51.564
UGGA: So, why don't you go
and talk to him?

03:51.606 --> 03:53.108
-Your dad's not much
of a talker.

03:53.149 --> 03:55.026
-He's more of a puncher.
-Guy,

03:55.068 --> 03:56.486
this is a new beginning
for you two.

03:56.528 --> 03:59.406
And you're a great hunter.
He'll love that.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.700
Besides, what's the worst
that can happen?

04:01.741 --> 04:04.786
GUY: Well, there's the
possibility of punching.
That's best-case scenario.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.081
I'll give it a shot.

04:08.123 --> 04:10.083
Beautiful day for
a hunt, eh, Grug?

04:10.125 --> 04:12.377
-Don't call me Grug.
Call me Grug.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.337
-Grug?
-No. Grug.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.756
-Grug?
-Not Grug. Grug.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.633
-I feel like we're saying
the same thing.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.928
-No! I'm saying Grug,
and you're saying Grug.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.263
-Uh... okay.

04:23.304 --> 04:25.432
So, what's the plan?

04:25.473 --> 04:28.768
-Plan? We're hunting!
That's the plan!

04:28.810 --> 04:31.688
We find an animal,
then we hunt it

04:31.730 --> 04:34.691
'cause that's how hunting
works! Got it?

04:34.733 --> 04:36.860
-Dad, Guy started surviving
on his own

04:36.901 --> 04:39.279
when he was a little kid.
He knows how to hunt.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.614
-Oh, yeah? Ever hunted
a crowverine?

04:41.656 --> 04:44.284
-Of course, he has.
Pretty sure he's hunted
them with you.

04:44.325 --> 04:45.660
-What about a bearacuda?

04:45.702 --> 04:47.787
-Where do you think
I got these boots from?

04:47.829 --> 04:48.830
(laughs)

04:48.872 --> 04:50.540
It's actually a fascinating
story,

04:50.582 --> 04:53.001
-but I don't wanna bore you.
-Thanks.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.419
Ever hunted a scorpulion?

04:54.461 --> 04:56.629
-Hunt a scorpulion?!
Why would I do that?!

04:56.671 --> 04:58.631
It's the most terrifying
predator known to man!

04:58.673 --> 05:00.842
I actually have a great
scorpulion story,

05:00.884 --> 05:02.761
but again, I don't
want to bore you. (laughs)

05:02.802 --> 05:05.847
-Appreciate that. And the reason
to hunt a scorpulion

05:05.889 --> 05:08.308
is because it's the
ultimate prize.

05:08.350 --> 05:11.728
Someday, I'll bag one. (sighs)

05:11.770 --> 05:15.106
Maybe if you spent
more time hunting
and less time with my daughter,

05:15.148 --> 05:16.691
-you could, too!
-Dad!

05:16.733 --> 05:20.904
-Hunting joke! It's all
part of the fun!

05:20.945 --> 05:24.532
(gasps) Ooh! Bearacuda tracks,
which means we're
getting closer.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.284
(grunting, panting)

05:26.326 --> 05:29.496
-Well, this is going great.
-Just give it a chance, Guy-boy.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.498
-Hm?
-(grumbles, sighs)

05:31.539 --> 05:33.792
Anything for you, Eepy-kins.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.336
-(Grug grunting)
-(buzzing)

05:36.378 --> 05:38.129
-Eep! Check it out!

05:38.171 --> 05:39.631
Bee-mu hive!

05:39.673 --> 05:41.966
And bee-mu hive means
bee-mu honey,

05:42.008 --> 05:44.010
-the perfect bearacuda bait.
-(buzzing continues)

05:44.052 --> 05:47.681
-You wanna take a stab
at the honey?
-I could,

05:47.722 --> 05:50.934
but Guy's got better
honey hands. Hey, Guy!

05:50.975 --> 05:52.185
Can you get us the honey?

05:52.227 --> 05:55.021
-You're the best honey
hunter here.
-I am?

05:55.063 --> 05:57.148
-EEP: Mm...
-(Grug growls)

05:57.190 --> 05:59.526
-Mm-hmm.
-I am! Mm-hmm.

05:59.567 --> 06:02.445
-You're on, Guy! Show
me the honey!

06:02.487 --> 06:05.281
(laughs) Never gets old!

06:05.323 --> 06:08.535
-I can't get that honey now.
Your dad's been poking the hive.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.704
Those bee-mus will sting
me senseless.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.580
-What's the hold up, Guy?

06:12.622 --> 06:15.792
We need honey to catch
bearacudas, not talk words!

06:15.834 --> 06:17.711
-(Eep whining)
-(Guy sighs)

06:17.752 --> 06:20.171
-Okay. Here we go! (sighs)

06:20.213 --> 06:21.381
-(buzzing)
-Ah.

06:21.423 --> 06:24.384
Almost--Ah! Got--Ah! It! Ow!

06:24.426 --> 06:26.386
Take it! Ah! Take the honey!

06:26.428 --> 06:28.555
-That's all you got? (sighs)

06:28.596 --> 06:31.224
I guess it's better
than nothing.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.392
-Are you okay?

06:32.434 --> 06:33.810
-I will be once
the venom runs its course.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.021
(groggy laugh) And
who might you be?

06:36.062 --> 06:38.314
-I'll let my dad know
we need some downtime.

06:38.356 --> 06:41.943
-(slurred) Good call,
and thank you for being
so kind, stranger.

06:48.366 --> 06:52.203
I'll approach from downwind,
you loop around to cut
it off, and then--

06:52.245 --> 06:53.872
-Guy can flush it out.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.290
(loud eating)

06:55.331 --> 06:57.334
-Yeah, that. Or...

06:57.375 --> 07:00.670
maybe Guy hangs back. Way back.

07:00.712 --> 07:03.590
Like back at the farm,
so it'll just be the two of us,

07:03.631 --> 07:06.009
being awesome and actually
catching something! Hm?

07:06.051 --> 07:09.304
-(laughs) I'm happy to help
however you want. Oh!

07:09.346 --> 07:10.513
Sorry. Um,

07:10.555 --> 07:12.140
-spike-nut?
-(Grug grunts)

07:12.182 --> 07:13.350
(sniffing)

07:13.391 --> 07:15.185
-The fresh tracks. Definitely
bearacudas.

07:15.226 --> 07:18.772
Probably heading to the stream
over the ridge.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.523
Four of 'em. They're large.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.192
(sniffing)

07:22.233 --> 07:23.735
Mm-hmm. They grew up together.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.446
Used to be close, but they've
been drifting apart lately.

07:26.488 --> 07:27.864
Different life goals.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.908
-You can really tell all that
from tasting the dirt?

07:29.949 --> 07:33.203
-See for yourself.
-(sighs) Walked into that one.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.704
* *

07:34.746 --> 07:37.415
-Mm-hmm...
-(chewing)

07:37.457 --> 07:40.710
-(choking, coughs)
-Ah! My eyes.

07:40.752 --> 07:43.046
Ooh! My foot! (pained groaning)

07:43.088 --> 07:44.255
(grunting)

07:44.297 --> 07:45.799
-Dad! What happened?

07:45.840 --> 07:49.302
-I stepped on a spike-nut shell.
I wonder how that got there.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.346
-Great question.
We may never know.

07:51.388 --> 07:52.514
(growls)

07:52.555 --> 07:54.557
-How's your foot?
-It's fine! Hands off!

07:54.599 --> 07:56.393
-(wincing)
-Looks bad.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.561
-Should we head back?
-No! I mean,

07:58.603 --> 08:00.438
you can walk it off, right, Dad?

08:00.480 --> 08:03.066
-Mm. A hunter doesn't
give up, honey.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.359
(wincing)

08:04.401 --> 08:07.237
-But you can barely walk.
-Guy will carry you!

08:07.278 --> 08:09.072
(gasps)

08:09.114 --> 08:12.075
-(snoring)
-EEP: Aw, he's smiling.

08:12.117 --> 08:13.910
I told you
my dad would warm up to you.

08:13.952 --> 08:16.246
-(straining)
Oh, great. And honestly,

08:16.287 --> 08:18.873
who needs to be able
to stand upright ever again?

08:18.915 --> 08:21.251
Oh, how much farther
to the bearacudas?

08:21.292 --> 08:24.713
-Less talk, more walk.
And make your steps less bumpy.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.423
(growling)

08:26.464 --> 08:28.174
Well, we made it.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.677
You were right, Eep.
I just needed to walk it off.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.929
-I walked it off.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.848
(both grunt)

08:34.889 --> 08:37.851
-(sighs) Which means
the hunt is on.

08:37.892 --> 08:41.146
-One for me, and one for you.
-What about one for Guy?

08:41.187 --> 08:44.024
-Guy? Uh, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.775
You ever use one
of these before?

08:45.817 --> 08:47.944
-No, but I'm sure I could
figure it out.

08:47.986 --> 08:50.530
-Figure it out?
(blows raspberry)

08:50.572 --> 08:52.741
Took me years to master
this weapon.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.492
-Dad, give him a chance.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.537
-(sighs) Well, if you think
you're up to it, knock
yourself out.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.998
Which is exactly what's
gonna happen.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.043
-Hm?
-You just whirl it and
hurl it, Guy-boy.

09:03.084 --> 09:03.960
-Got it.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.755
(grunting) Whoa... And knot it.

09:06.796 --> 09:07.881
(laughs) Hm.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.177
* *

09:12.218 --> 09:14.429
-(growls)
-GRUG: Almost there.

09:14.471 --> 09:15.430
-(sniffing)
-Good.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.807
-Very good.
-(grunts)

09:17.849 --> 09:19.809
-(whipping, smack)
-(growls, snarls)

09:19.851 --> 09:21.394
Oh no. Bad. Very bad!

09:21.436 --> 09:22.979
(roars)

09:23.021 --> 09:24.481
-(gasps) Dad's in trouble!

09:24.522 --> 09:26.399
-Not for long!

09:26.441 --> 09:28.485
(grunting)

09:28.526 --> 09:29.486
(Grug screaming)

09:29.527 --> 09:32.864
(slow motion screaming)

09:34.741 --> 09:36.368
-(gasps) Huh?

09:37.494 --> 09:40.372
Guy? Was that your whip-zip?

09:40.413 --> 09:41.664
-Um...

09:41.706 --> 09:43.124
-It sure was!

09:43.166 --> 09:45.794
-Pretty impressive, right, Dad?
-I guess.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.672
-You guess?
Dad, it was a perfect bullseye,

09:48.713 --> 09:51.174
and it was his first time
using a whip-zip.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.384
He's a natural!

09:52.425 --> 09:55.762
-I guess he is. Huh.
Didn't see that coming.

09:55.804 --> 09:59.557
Maybe I've been too hard on you.
Hmm... Hm?

09:59.599 --> 10:02.268
Hmm... Maybe you're not all bad.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.979
Maybe I won't have to drop you
into a volcano

10:05.021 --> 10:06.690
to keep you away from
my daughter.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.525
-Uh, thank you, I think.

10:08.566 --> 10:09.734
-No problem, Guy.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.362
Or should I call you
Bullseye, huh?

10:12.404 --> 10:14.614
-Oh. Uh, sure. I mean,

10:14.656 --> 10:16.491
I just did what had to be done.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.785
-(laughs) You sure
did, Bullseye!

10:18.827 --> 10:20.870
You sure did!

10:20.912 --> 10:23.581
-I made the shot, Eep.
I made the shot!

10:23.623 --> 10:25.500
-(laughs)
-I am so proud of you,

10:25.542 --> 10:27.085
my little cucumbeet.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.005
-Mm... You can call me Bullseye.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.715
You, too, beara-lose-a!

10:31.756 --> 10:32.716
-(roars)
-Ah!

10:32.757 --> 10:34.718
Wait up for Bullseye!

10:34.759 --> 10:37.178
-Thanks again for
saving my bacon.

10:37.220 --> 10:39.889
Also, this bacon is
delicious. Mm!

10:39.931 --> 10:41.099
-Any time, Grug.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.435
-You know what?
Why don't you call me Grug?

10:43.476 --> 10:44.477
-I just did.

10:44.519 --> 10:46.730
-No. You called me
Grug, not Grug.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.064
-Still not hearing
the difference.

10:48.106 --> 10:51.151
-It's just so nice to see
you two getting along.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.569
I just hope this new friendship

10:52.610 --> 10:54.029
makes it back to
the farm tomorrow.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.781
-Actually, I had another idea
about tomorrow.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.950
I was thinking maybe
we'd go to Venom Valley

10:58.992 --> 11:00.744
and hunt for scorpulions.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.287
-What? Why?

11:02.328 --> 11:04.247
-I've always wanted to
bag a scorpulion,

11:04.289 --> 11:06.332
but you need a perfect
shot to get one.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.918
A perfect shot like
you threw earlier.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.588
What do you say, Bullseye? Hm?

11:11.629 --> 11:13.131
-Hm?
-Uh,

11:13.173 --> 11:15.884
I'd say that idea is
right on target.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.470
You might even say
it's a bullseye!

11:19.471 --> 11:22.849
-BOTH: Oh!
-Bullseye!

11:22.891 --> 11:24.768
-Bullseye! Bullseye!
Bullseye! Bullseye!

11:24.809 --> 11:26.227
-Bullseye! Bullseye! Bullseye!

11:26.269 --> 11:27.228
* *

11:27.270 --> 11:28.605
(creature crowing)

11:28.646 --> 11:30.148
(yawning)

11:30.190 --> 11:32.025
-Ah!
-This is a terrible idea.

11:32.067 --> 11:35.111
-Making my heart stop? I agree.
-No. Hunting scorpulions.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.322
-Come on.
I'm Bullseye, remember?

11:37.364 --> 11:39.532
If I can save your dad
with a perfect shot,

11:39.574 --> 11:41.284
I can definitely
hit a scorpulion.

11:41.326 --> 11:42.285
-But what if you can't?

11:42.327 --> 11:44.120
What if that was
just a lucky shot?

11:44.162 --> 11:46.623
-No such thing as luck
in whip-zips, Eepy-kins.

11:46.664 --> 11:47.791
Everyone knows that.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.000
-You didn't even know what

11:49.042 --> 11:50.627
a whip-zip was until yesterday!

11:50.669 --> 11:52.504
-The point is Bullseye
don't miss.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.048
-Doesn't miss. And can you stop
calling yourself Bullseye?

11:55.090 --> 11:57.842
-It was your dad's idea,
and your dad finally respects me

11:57.884 --> 12:00.053
instead of resenting me.
Isn't that what you wanted?

12:00.095 --> 12:01.262
-Rise and shine, Bullseye!

12:01.304 --> 12:03.139
Made you some
breakfast cucumbeets.

12:03.181 --> 12:06.142
-Trust me, you're
gonna love 'em.
-(Eep groans)

12:06.184 --> 12:07.018
* *

12:07.060 --> 12:09.938
-So how big do scorpulions get?

12:09.979 --> 12:11.356
Not too big, right?

12:11.398 --> 12:12.649
-Oh, they're huge!

12:12.691 --> 12:14.484
And their quills are
sharp as knives.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.820
And if you get stung,
I heard the venom feels

12:16.861 --> 12:18.905
like your body is full of lava.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.408
-Lava?
-Hey, Guy, want some spike-nuts?

12:21.449 --> 12:22.992
-Spike me! (chomp)

12:23.034 --> 12:25.578
-You know, Guy, you remind me
of someone I used to hunt with

12:25.620 --> 12:28.081
when I was younger.
About my height, same weight,

12:28.123 --> 12:30.291
even wore the same pelt,
and he looked just like me.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.668
-Was it you, Dad?

12:31.710 --> 12:33.503
-In fact, every time I looked
in a pool of water,

12:33.545 --> 12:36.464
there he was,
looking back at me, all wiggly.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.758
-Pretty sure that
was your reflection.
-Because it was you.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.385
-But I'm glad you're
here instead of him,

12:40.427 --> 12:42.971
Guy, because he never
nailed the scorpulion.

12:43.013 --> 12:45.348
-Bullseye will, though!
-Huh?

12:45.390 --> 12:47.350
* *

12:47.392 --> 12:48.852
-(clang)
-Ow! Oh!

12:48.893 --> 12:50.061
-Oh, what happened?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.063
-I stepped on one of
your spike-nut shells

12:52.105 --> 12:53.356
and messed up my foot!

12:53.398 --> 12:55.859
Guess we need to head
back. Right now.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.069
-Looks like the scorpulions
will have to wait.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.530
-What are you talking about?
We'll carry you!

13:00.572 --> 13:02.032
It'll be easy for the two of us.

13:02.073 --> 13:05.368
-Solid logic.
And there's no scorpulion

13:05.410 --> 13:06.870
without scorpu-tryin'!

13:06.911 --> 13:09.164
Am I right? (laughs) Right?

13:09.205 --> 13:11.875
BOTH: Ooh... Bullseye!

13:11.916 --> 13:14.461
Bullseye! Bullseye!
Bullseye! Bullseye!

13:14.502 --> 13:16.046
-Bullseye! Bullseye!
Bullseye! Bullseye!

13:16.087 --> 13:18.048
-Forget it! My foot's fine!

13:18.089 --> 13:19.883
(Grug and Guy grunting)

13:19.924 --> 13:22.177
-Hm. Venom Valley isn't
too much farther.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.637
-Ah, I can almost
smell the venom.

13:24.679 --> 13:27.557
Did I mention that a scorpulion
sting feels like lava and--

13:27.599 --> 13:29.059
-Yes, you mentioned that, Dad.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.936
-But I'm not worried
'cause we got Bullseye!

13:31.978 --> 13:34.814
-And whip-zips.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.233
-Hm...
(grunts)

13:37.275 --> 13:38.985
-What whip-zips?
-Oh no.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.571
Oh, they're gone! I lost them!

13:41.613 --> 13:43.198
-What? No way!

13:43.239 --> 13:45.617
Guess we'll have to call
the hunt off and head home.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.494
-Not so fast.

13:47.535 --> 13:50.789
(humming)

13:50.830 --> 13:53.333
Boom!
New whip-zips, ready to rip.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.251
-Bullseye for the win! (laughs)

13:55.293 --> 13:57.837
-(both laughing)
-(Eep sighs)

13:57.879 --> 13:59.005
* *

13:59.047 --> 14:01.257
-Ah. All we need to do
is cross this log,

14:01.299 --> 14:03.301
and we're in scorpulion
territory.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.970
-Not sure about that tree.
Looks a little shaky.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.972
-Hm. Seems pretty solid to me.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.016
Go ahead, Bullseye.
Get up there!

14:10.058 --> 14:11.434
-(echoing)
<i>Get up there! Get up there...</i>

14:11.476 --> 14:14.020
No way! Now it's the guy who
sounds like me

14:14.062 --> 14:16.731
who hangs out in ravines,
caves, and canyons.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.983
-Hey, pal!
-(echoing) <i>Hey, pal...</i>

14:19.025 --> 14:22.237
-No, Grug, that's an echo.
Listen. Hello!

14:22.278 --> 14:23.822
-(echoing) <i>Hello! Hello...</i>
-(gasps)

14:23.863 --> 14:26.157
-No way!
My friend is friends with a guy

14:26.199 --> 14:27.826
who sounds just like you!

14:27.867 --> 14:29.786
-Check this out. Bullseye!

14:29.828 --> 14:31.162
-(echoing) <i>Bullseye...</i>
-(panting)

14:31.204 --> 14:32.664
-Phil's the worst!

14:32.706 --> 14:35.041
(echoing) <i>Phil's the worst!</i>
<i>Phil's the worst...</i>

14:36.376 --> 14:38.461
* *

14:38.503 --> 14:40.463
-(gasps) What happened?
Where's the tree?

14:40.505 --> 14:42.382
-Huh. Guess it must
have fallen in.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.592
Weird. Well, there's
no way across.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.678
-Let's head home.
-(gasps) I got a better idea!

14:48.972 --> 14:50.140
* *

14:50.181 --> 14:52.892
Okay, Grug. Just punch here,
here, and here.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.227
-You really think
this will work?

14:54.269 --> 14:56.771
-Oh, yeah. Bullseye
knows bullseyes.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.232
-(grunting)
-(tree cracking)

14:59.274 --> 15:01.651
-Can we please stop
saying bullseye?

15:01.693 --> 15:04.029
GRUG/GUY: Bullseye!

15:04.070 --> 15:05.905
<i>Bullseye, Bullseye, Bullseye</i>

15:05.947 --> 15:07.407
<i>Bullseye, Bullseye, Bullseye!</i>

15:07.449 --> 15:09.409
<i>Bullseye, Bullseye, Bullseye</i>

15:09.451 --> 15:12.370
-(Eep grumbles)
-(Grug and Guy singing)

15:14.539 --> 15:17.292
GRUG: This is it. Venom Valley.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.294
Scorpulion territory.

15:19.336 --> 15:22.130
Okay. The most important thing
about hunting scorpulions

15:22.172 --> 15:25.008
is to stay hidden.
If they see us,

15:25.050 --> 15:27.427
they'll attack,
and they won't stop

15:27.469 --> 15:30.347
until we're finished
or they are. Everyone clear?

15:30.388 --> 15:31.890
-Crystal.
-Guy?

15:31.931 --> 15:34.351
-Sorry.
That's a crystal I found.
Yes, I'm clear.

15:34.392 --> 15:37.270
-Me, too. So maybe we should be
hiding behind that bush.

15:37.312 --> 15:38.855
-Oh. Good idea, Eep.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.399
* *

15:41.441 --> 15:42.984
-See anything?
-GUY: Nothing.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.861
-Welp, we've been here forever.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.654
I don't think there's
any scorpulions out there.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.865
-Eep's right.
Also, my hands are killing me.

15:48.907 --> 15:50.200
-What a bust.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.619
We've got everything
we need to bag a scorpulion,

15:52.660 --> 15:54.204
but no scorpulions.

15:54.245 --> 15:57.832
-Ah. Tough break, but we should
get going. I'll lead the way.

15:59.084 --> 16:00.293
-Wait! I think I see one.

16:00.335 --> 16:01.711
(growling, chattering)

16:01.753 --> 16:03.797
EEP: (quietly)
No, that's just a baby racobra.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.507
-Let's go.
-What? What are you
talking about?

16:05.548 --> 16:07.050
-That's a scorpulion.
-Yeah.

16:07.092 --> 16:09.552
You could tell by the head,
quills, pinchers, and stinger!

16:09.594 --> 16:11.262
It's actually a very
specific animal.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.347
-You ready, Bullseye?

16:12.389 --> 16:13.723
-I was born ready.

16:13.765 --> 16:16.059
Except I couldn't walk,
or even hold up my own head.

16:16.101 --> 16:17.310
I guess I wasn't really
ready then,

16:17.352 --> 16:19.562
but I'm ready now!

16:19.604 --> 16:22.691
-Even though I've never
believed in you, or liked you,

16:22.732 --> 16:25.443
-I believe in you now.
-Thank you, Grug.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.154
That means everything to me.

16:28.196 --> 16:29.280
And by that,
I mean the last part.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.991
-Now let's get us a scorpulion.

16:32.033 --> 16:34.077
And by us, I mean you.

16:34.119 --> 16:37.997
(grunting, humming)

16:38.039 --> 16:40.250
-Wait!
-Why?

16:40.291 --> 16:42.168
-Because you're not
going to make the shot,

16:42.210 --> 16:43.712
and then we're scorpu-lunch.

16:43.753 --> 16:46.756
-No way! He's Bullseye!

16:46.798 --> 16:48.091
-No, he's Guy.

16:48.133 --> 16:51.344
And he didn't snag that
bearacuda earlier. I did.

16:52.095 --> 16:53.304
(roars)

16:53.346 --> 16:56.641
<i>Guy tripped and his whip-zip</i>
<i>sailed wide,</i>

16:56.683 --> 16:58.560
<i>so I threw mine.</i>

16:58.601 --> 16:59.352
(Grug screaming)

16:59.394 --> 17:02.605
(slow motion screaming)

17:03.732 --> 17:05.859
* *

17:05.900 --> 17:09.487
-No. That's... What?
I mean, I'm Bullseye.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.531
-Fine. So, hit that
tree over there.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.575
Better yet,
how about this tree right here?

17:13.616 --> 17:16.411
-(scoffs) I could do
that in my sleep.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.247
(slow motion yell)

17:19.289 --> 17:21.291
(triumphant music)

17:21.332 --> 17:24.169
(music slows down)

17:24.210 --> 17:25.211
Nailed it, right?

17:25.253 --> 17:27.047
-Not even close. Way off.

17:27.088 --> 17:28.798
-That was the worst shot
I've ever seen.

17:28.840 --> 17:29.924
You lied to me, Guy.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.344
You're not Bullseye!
You're Bulls-lie!

17:32.385 --> 17:34.971
-Dad, Guy didn't lie to you.
I did.

17:35.013 --> 17:37.265
-But why?
-Because I had to!

17:37.307 --> 17:39.184
All I've ever wanted
is for you to like Guy,

17:39.225 --> 17:41.061
but all you ever do
is shut him down.

17:41.102 --> 17:44.147
-That's not true!
He invited me on this
hunting trip!

17:44.189 --> 17:46.733
-No, I lied about that, too.
-Oh, come on!

17:46.775 --> 17:48.985
-And you thought
this would work?
-It worked for Mom!

17:49.027 --> 17:52.489
She put cucumbeets in your pie,
and now, you like cucumbeets!

17:52.530 --> 17:55.909
Well, now hunting is the pie,
and Guy is the cucumbeet.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.202
(gasps)

17:57.243 --> 17:59.662
-Your mom put cucumbeets
in my pie?!

17:59.704 --> 18:02.415
-You know what? This seems like
a father-daughter discussion,

18:02.457 --> 18:04.834
so I'm just going to go...
somewhere else.

18:04.876 --> 18:07.420
-(growling)
-Uh-oh.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.923
(snarling, roaring)

18:09.964 --> 18:12.175
-(all gasp)
-Hey, Grug?

18:12.217 --> 18:15.720
What was it you said would
happen if a scorpulion saw us?

18:15.762 --> 18:17.222
-Oh. Uh, I said--

18:17.263 --> 18:18.723
-(roars)
-Run!

18:18.765 --> 18:22.977
-(all panting)
-(snarling, roaring)

18:23.019 --> 18:25.939
We'll be safe up there!
Scorpulions can't climb vines!

18:25.980 --> 18:28.233
(panting, grunting)

18:28.274 --> 18:30.068
-(snarls)
-(quills popping)

18:30.110 --> 18:32.070
(straining, grunting)

18:32.112 --> 18:33.947
EEP: Forget vines!

18:33.988 --> 18:36.282
Dad! It's getting closer!

18:36.324 --> 18:37.534
(roars)

18:37.575 --> 18:39.828
-Hey, scorpulion! Think fast!

18:41.913 --> 18:44.332
-That was too fast!
-Forget boulders!

18:45.542 --> 18:47.794
-(loud whisper)
Guys! I think we lost him.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.465
-(screaming)
-(roars)

18:52.507 --> 18:54.342
-Forget trees!
-(all scream)

18:54.384 --> 18:55.635
(panting)

18:55.677 --> 18:57.637
-Yes! A cave! We
can hide in there!

18:57.679 --> 18:59.472
-(roars)
-Ah! And then what?

18:59.514 --> 19:01.641
That scorpulion won't quit
until he gets us!

19:01.683 --> 19:03.643
-I don't know!
But caves help me think,

19:03.685 --> 19:05.311
so cave first, then think.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.313
(all panting)

19:07.355 --> 19:08.314
-Huh?

19:08.356 --> 19:10.150
-(growling)
-Hm?

19:10.191 --> 19:11.317
(snarling, roar)

19:11.359 --> 19:12.819
-(gasps)
-Guy!

19:12.861 --> 19:15.739
-What are you doing?!
-What has to be done. (grunts)

19:15.780 --> 19:17.490
Oops, wrong one.

19:17.532 --> 19:19.325
-(Guy gasps)
-(growling)

19:19.367 --> 19:20.994
(all yell)

19:21.036 --> 19:23.329
Ah! Not that one either.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.206
-(roars)
-Ah! Bullseye!

19:25.248 --> 19:27.292
-Huh? Guy!

19:27.334 --> 19:28.752
(gasps)

19:28.793 --> 19:30.170
-Sorta. Huh.

19:30.211 --> 19:32.505
* *

19:32.547 --> 19:34.174
-See? This is why
I don't like Guy.

19:34.215 --> 19:37.469
We were gonna hide inside this
cave until the scorpulion left,

19:37.510 --> 19:39.429
but thanks to Guy,
we're trapped!

19:39.471 --> 19:41.348
-Dad, Guy didn't trap us!

19:41.389 --> 19:42.766
Scorpulions never leave

19:42.807 --> 19:44.684
until they get what they
came for, remember?!

19:44.726 --> 19:48.521
-Well, yeah, but Guy doesn't
stand a chance out there.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.482
-(growling)
-Wait. He knew that, didn't he?

19:50.523 --> 19:52.859
-Yes! Guy's saving us!

19:52.901 --> 19:55.737
-So we need to get out
there and save him!
-Wait!

19:55.779 --> 19:59.032
Guy's saving us,
so we need to get out
there and save him!

19:59.074 --> 20:00.408
-Mm-hmm!

20:01.242 --> 20:05.038
(panting, grunting)

20:05.080 --> 20:07.415
-(gasping)
-(snarling)

20:07.457 --> 20:09.167
-Whoa! Whoa!

20:09.209 --> 20:10.418
-Too close!
-(roars)

20:10.460 --> 20:12.837
You can do this.
You're Bullseye.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.422
(roars)

20:14.464 --> 20:16.925
-Okay, maybe you're not
Bullseye, but you're still Guy.
Ah!

20:20.887 --> 20:21.680
(roars)

20:21.721 --> 20:23.348
-Ah! That's okay. Ah!

20:23.390 --> 20:25.100
More of a stick guy anyway.

20:26.518 --> 20:28.728
-Ah! (grunts)
-(snarling)

20:28.770 --> 20:30.230
My whip-zip?

20:30.271 --> 20:31.356
Wow, my shot was way off.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.024
But this is the best
chance I've got.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.110
So here goes everything.

20:36.945 --> 20:38.822
-(whispering)
I believe in you now.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.740
-Still? Even though
I'm not Bullseye?

20:40.782 --> 20:42.909
-Yes.
Because you're Guy.

20:42.951 --> 20:45.537
-Thanks, Grug!
Wait, why are you whispering?

20:45.578 --> 20:46.746
-Uh, no reason.
-Grug!

20:46.788 --> 20:48.623
Are you eating pie
before dinner?

20:48.665 --> 20:50.000
And who is that
you're talking to?

20:50.041 --> 20:52.836
-Gotta go. You got this.
-Is that Guy?

20:53.420 --> 20:54.796
(grunting)

20:54.838 --> 20:56.047
(yelling)

20:56.089 --> 20:57.173
(roars)

20:57.215 --> 20:59.467
-Hurry, Dad! Keep digging!
-(grunting)

20:59.509 --> 21:03.471
-We're coming for
you, Bulls-lie! I mean, Guy!

21:06.141 --> 21:08.059
(yells, gasps)

21:08.101 --> 21:09.602
* *

21:09.644 --> 21:12.605
-Guy! You did it!
-He sure did!

21:12.647 --> 21:15.025
With a perfect shot
from the whip-zip!

21:15.066 --> 21:16.568
He is Bullseye!

21:16.609 --> 21:19.029
EEP/GRUG: Bullseye!
Bullseye! Bullseye!

21:19.070 --> 21:20.530
Bullseye! Bullseye!

21:20.572 --> 21:22.449
-No. No Bullseye, I'm afraid.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.159
Here's what really happened.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.245
Yah! (grunts)

21:29.497 --> 21:30.665
(squawks)

21:34.085 --> 21:35.211
(roars)

21:35.253 --> 21:37.297
So the truth is,
I just got lucky.

21:37.339 --> 21:38.840
-Technically, you did take

21:38.882 --> 21:41.134
the scorpulion down
with a whip-zip.

21:41.176 --> 21:42.469
-None of that matters.

21:42.510 --> 21:46.222
What matters is you
were selfless and fearless

21:46.264 --> 21:48.808
and reckless in the best way.

21:48.850 --> 21:51.936
You risked your life
to save ours.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.731
-Oh, I was just doing--
-Not finished!

21:54.773 --> 21:58.276
Because you'd do anything
for my daughter.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.779
And if you care that
much about Eep,

22:00.820 --> 22:03.907
I guess I can admit
I care a little about you.

22:05.116 --> 22:06.076
(sighs)

22:06.117 --> 22:09.162
-Thank you, Grug!
I love you, too!

22:09.204 --> 22:11.831
-Whoa! Did I say love?
I didn't say love.

22:11.873 --> 22:14.626
I didn't even say like.
I said care. A little!

22:14.668 --> 22:17.045
And stop calling me Grug!
My name is Grug.

22:17.087 --> 22:18.838
* *

22:18.880 --> 22:20.590
Come on. Let's head home.

22:20.632 --> 22:23.718
Get ourselves some
cucumbeet pie.

22:24.886 --> 22:25.679
(sighs)

22:25.720 --> 22:27.305
-Well, that's progress.

22:27.347 --> 22:28.765
-Yeah. Baby steps.

22:28.807 --> 22:32.102
So, are we taking this thing
back to the farm? (laughs)

22:32.143 --> 22:34.646
-Are you out of your mind?
It's a scorpulion!

22:34.688 --> 22:37.190
-Good call. I suppose
we should set it free...

22:37.232 --> 22:39.526
-(vine snaps, scorpulion growls)
-It's free! Run!

22:39.567 --> 22:41.277
(roars)

22:41.319 --> 22:44.572
* *
