<i>DAMIEN: Do not let him

We can save Nora and stop Mallus
from being freed together.

<i>SARA: We have the six Totems.</i>

00:14.306 --> 00:17.389
What if the only way to kill Mallus
is to let him out?

00:17.476 --> 00:19.058
WALLY: We are here to help you
create the anachronism

00:19.144 --> 00:21.101

and then we can kill him.

or I will lay waste to your world.

00:57.266 --> 00:58.552

of the situation is correct,

I'm going to buy you some time.

- Wally, create a distraction.
- WALLY: Got it.

01:35.387 --> 01:38.425

out of his cage was a bad idea.

learned to think like a Legend.

much longer.

GIDEON: Yes, but there is another one.

you were buying us time with your life.

03:38.427 --> 03:39.588
Listen carefully.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.885
This gambit will not kill Mallus.

It's all right, Sara.

Okay, somebody's got to say it,
so I'm gonna say it.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.260
This is all our fault.

05:13.647 --> 05:17.515
Apparently I'm not gonna say it,
but, yeah, we let Mallus out.

05:17.859 --> 05:20.146
Well, whose stupid idea
was it to fight him

05:20.237 --> 05:23.025
with some magic necklaces?

05:23.114 --> 05:25.355
It wasn't the totems that failed.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.565
It was us.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.196
Yeah, we might wanna
rethink that whole

05:28.286 --> 05:30.869
"we screw up things
for the better" motto.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.580
Okay, so what's the plan, Captain?

05:33.667 --> 05:36.329
All I know is that Rip gave his life

05:36.419 --> 05:38.126
so that we could take
the totems somewhere

05:38.213 --> 05:40.580
that Mallus can't find them.

05:44.302 --> 05:45.508

unleashed an ancient time demon

06:00.402 --> 06:01.938

06:55.248 --> 06:56.238
Maybe.

06:57.042 --> 06:59.124
Probably. Most likely.

I enjoy this getup,

Mallus is still out there.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.169
Great. Let's hear it.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.336
So we know that the six totems are
the only thing that can stop Mallus.

Mallus sees all,

09:24.522 --> 09:27.355
Then why did he bring back
you germs to do his business?

09:27.442 --> 09:29.024
Because he's probably
still recovering

09:46.294 --> 09:47.876
Yeah, sorry, we only brought two,

- Damn it, Ray.

That goes without saying.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.301
-(WHOOSHING)
- Whoa!

11:25.226 --> 11:26.261
Didn't you hear me over comms?

11:26.352 --> 11:28.389
Ray punched me in the face
with his giant banana hands,

11:28.479 --> 11:30.015
and took off with Damien Darhk.

11:30.648 --> 11:31.638

You can't come with me, Nathaniel.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.117
I'm going all the way
back to the beginning.

11:49.250 --> 11:53.835
To meet with my ancestors,
the original totem bearers.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.245
Why?

11:55.340 --> 11:58.207
Sara thinks we're not cut out
to wield the totems.

11:58.301 --> 12:01.214
But I believe the reason we
didn't defeat Mallus the first time

12:01.304 --> 12:03.466
is because we didn't know how.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.046
So you wanna talk
to the original bearers

12:05.141 --> 12:08.429
so they can teach you
the totem user manual.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.260
-I am definitely coming with you.
- No.

12:10.688 --> 12:13.180
It was my decision
to save my village.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.982
I shattered history
and allowed the demon to escape.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.319
It's up to me to
find a way to stop him.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.648
Amaya, look at me.

12:24.118 --> 12:26.576
We decided to save your village.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.370

some crazy drug trip,

12:29.999 --> 12:31.660
you better believe
I'm coming with you.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.371
No, Nathaniel.

No.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.554
They stopped Mallus together.

is not because we're unworthy.

It's because we've been

do you think that was an accident?

15:47.572 --> 15:48.562
Yes, I do.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.193
Mick, the chances of you
running into your father

Zari, you remember the way your totem
called mine the moment you put it on?

16:01.627 --> 16:02.958
It wanted you to stay with us.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.541
So maybe it wasn't
a coincidence that I joined the team.

No.

And what about Damien Darhk?

36:50.834 --> 36:52.541
Oh, your dirty hat.

36:53.420 --> 36:54.410
That's weird.

36:55.797 --> 36:56.787
Sweet.

37:00.677 --> 37:01.838
RAY: Hey.

37:01.928 --> 37:04.590
Stop, I need to... I need to
talk to her for, like, two seconds.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.214
Alone, please.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.929
(CHUCKLES) I lied.
It'll be more like 20 seconds.

37:13.398 --> 37:16.857
So, I found something
on the ship that was your dad's.

37:16.943 --> 37:21.153
And I thought maybe you'd
want something to remember him by.

37:21.614 --> 37:24.732
As I spend the rest of my life
rotting in a Time Bureau prison?

37:30.874 --> 37:32.785
That's my father's time stone.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.118
He died to give you a second chance.

37:37.547 --> 37:38.582
Don't waste it.

37:50.769 --> 37:53.636
Are you glad I picked you up
in Zambesi six months ago?

37:54.105 --> 37:57.063
I think the words you used were,
"Just one more mission."

37:57.150 --> 37:59.061
It's better than the line
they used on me.

37:59.152 --> 38:00.938
"Come with us if you wanna live."

38:01.029 --> 38:02.611
I almost die every week on the ship.

38:02.697 --> 38:03.858
(CHUCKLES)

38:03.948 --> 38:06.280
But you found a home.

38:06.367 --> 38:07.482
I did.

38:07.577 --> 38:11.992
And as much fun as this has been,
it's time for me to go home.

38:12.081 --> 38:14.243
Amaya, you can't
leave me and Sara, and...

38:15.460 --> 38:16.700
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

38:18.630 --> 38:19.870
You guys are my family.

38:20.882 --> 38:22.043
Always will be.

38:22.967 --> 38:26.585
But I have another family
waiting for me in the years to come.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.345
And they need me more.

38:30.225 --> 38:32.466
Well, you will always
have a home on the Wave-rider.

38:33.269 --> 38:34.680
I'm gonna miss you guys.

38:36.731 --> 38:39.974
- Um... Is that Jonah Hex's hat?
- Shut up.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.354
-Is there-
- I can't.

38:41.444 --> 38:42.434
- Do they-
- Stop, please.

38:42.529 --> 38:43.610
- I'll miss that.
- Is this...

38:47.450 --> 38:48.440
Yeah. (SIGHS)

38:48.535 --> 38:51.778
I guess this place is all right,
if you like untouched nature,

38:51.871 --> 38:53.077
and beautiful views.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.405
I do love it here.

38:55.959 --> 38:58.041
But there are a lot
of things I'm gonna miss.

38:58.711 --> 39:01.874
Like cheese puffs, and sports bras.

39:01.965 --> 39:03.080
Mmm-hmm.

39:03.925 --> 39:05.586
And you, Nathaniel.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.631
You aren't gonna miss
any of those things.

39:13.309 --> 39:15.175
Because you're not
gonna remember them.

39:17.689 --> 39:18.895
(NATE SIGHS)

39:22.110 --> 39:23.100
I don't wanna forget.

39:25.613 --> 39:26.819
Because if I do,

39:27.866 --> 39:30.574
I would have lost the only
part of you that I'm allowed to keep.

39:44.465 --> 39:45.455
Goodbye, Amaya.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.380
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

39:50.805 --> 39:51.795
Don't turn around.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.213
Don't turn around.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.132
Don't turn around.

40:19.918 --> 40:20.908
Good call, Mick.

40:21.836 --> 40:24.123
When I said Aruba, I meant me.

40:24.213 --> 40:25.703
Not all of you.

40:25.798 --> 40:28.916
Still, nothing helps
a broken heart like a good tan.

40:29.469 --> 40:30.800
Should've invited Ava.

40:30.887 --> 40:32.377
Oh, we've got plans.

40:32.555 --> 40:33.545
(SLURPS)

40:33.640 --> 40:35.472
And until then, she's busy fixing

40:35.558 --> 40:38.266
all those pesky anachronisms
we left behind.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.808
Well, that's the thing about
defeating an ancient time demon.

40:41.898 --> 40:43.184
Everything else seems boring.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.810
I'm good with boring.

40:46.819 --> 40:50.653
Hey, idiot. Get out of here.
This is a private beach.

40:50.782 --> 40:53.069
Fancy meeting you lot out here.

40:53.576 --> 40:54.611
Constantine?

40:55.620 --> 40:56.781
Did you really think I was him?

40:57.288 --> 40:58.278
It's me.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.498
Gary, Ray obviously
has been day-drinking.

41:01.876 --> 41:02.957
The wig's too much, right?

41:03.127 --> 41:05.960
No, it's very presidential.

41:06.923 --> 41:08.459
Gary, what do you want?

41:08.841 --> 41:10.081
He's been with me, love.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.134
Oh, I need a word with you sorry lot.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.007
Now...

41:16.474 --> 41:18.886
Whose brilliant idea was it

41:18.977 --> 41:21.810
to let an ancient demon
out of his bloody cage?

41:22.563 --> 41:23.598
Sara's.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.314
Well, you opened a door, love.

41:27.026 --> 41:29.313
And Mallus wasn't
the only thing that got out.
