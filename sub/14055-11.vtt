WEBVTT

00:03.245 --> 00:05.285
Her dad is dying.

00:05.564 --> 00:07.365
Rebecca Bloom, love of your life?

00:07.405 --> 00:08.205
Will you come with me?

00:08.205 --> 00:11.005
- Lindsay asked me to be the buffer between her and Caleb.
- Grandpa hates you.

00:11.085 --> 00:13.365
So, what is it the two of you really want?

00:13.445 --> 00:14.565
- Money?
- What?

00:14.685 --> 00:15.765
Cohen's going to do his own comic.

00:15.845 --> 00:17.405
- I think they're really good.
- Yeah?

00:17.445 --> 00:20.165
Yeah, the boobs are a little big.
Well, aren't they?

00:20.245 --> 00:22.485
Summer and I may be taking a step forward in our relationship.

00:22.525 --> 00:25.245
Aren't you sick of me? We've hung out every single day this week.

00:25.565 --> 00:28.285
- You're still in love with her.
- She's dead.

00:29.805 --> 00:31.645
Rebecca.

00:45.805 --> 00:48.325
- You're up early.
- I'm studying for this test.

00:48.405 --> 00:50.885
Oh, yeah, I know, it's great.
I was actually on my way out just to talk.

00:51.085 --> 00:55.325
- Studying.
- Fine. We can talk here. I just think the issue feels a little more pool housey.

00:55.445 --> 00:59.445
- Is this about Alex?
- No. She's merely kitchen table fodder at this point.

00:59.565 --> 01:02.645
- She's no longer up to pool house snuff.
- So, it's Summer and Zach.

01:02.845 --> 01:07.805
Yes, which I realize is more of an evening subject, best served over a game of Playstation.

01:08.565 --> 01:10.525
- I'll allow it.
- Great, thanks a lot.

01:11.245 --> 01:13.885
So, the three of us are moving forward with this comic book.

01:14.285 --> 01:17.645
- Right, so?
- So, Summer and I are getting involved professionally, Ryan.

01:17.725 --> 01:20.965
- Now, you know how these things go.
Late nights at the office...
- You don't have an office.

01:21.085 --> 01:26.325
Sure, but with the added stress of work and deadlines, you know, things can get sexy.

01:26.645 --> 01:29.685
- You're writing a comic book. Not sexy.
- So, you think I'm reaching.

01:29.925 --> 01:32.045
I think you're moving on with Alex,
you moved on with Summer,

01:32.125 --> 01:34.805
and for the first time in your life, you're not facing any women issues.

01:34.885 --> 01:38.965
- You're saying I'm just complaining that I have nothing to complain about.
- This is what I'm saying.

01:40.325 --> 01:41.805
Okay, great.

01:42.005 --> 01:45.685
Then I will await the next great romance to wreak havoc on my heart and mind.

01:45.845 --> 01:47.285
I can hardly wait.

02:14.085 --> 02:15.325
You're up early.

02:15.445 --> 02:18.365
- Are you sneaking in after curfew?
- Busted.

02:19.125 --> 02:22.445
- Am I grounded?
- Perhaps if I let you off...

02:23.205 --> 02:25.205
you'll remember this act of kindness,

02:25.405 --> 02:28.205
and afford me the same leniency should I miss my own curfew.

02:28.365 --> 02:30.325
- Keep dreaming.
- It was worth a shot.

02:45.445 --> 02:47.805
You're home. I was worried about you.

02:47.925 --> 02:50.085
Oh, I'm okay. You know, just beat.

02:51.045 --> 02:53.525
How did Professor Bloom take the news about Rebecca?

02:54.045 --> 02:56.925
- How do you think he took it?
- I can only imagine.

02:57.165 --> 02:59.765
His only daughter, and now she's gone,
and he didn't even get to see her.

03:09.685 --> 03:11.685
- Hello?
- Hey, Sandy. Rebecca.

03:13.365 --> 03:16.165
Listen, I'm at the pier. Do you want me to grab you some coffee?

03:16.285 --> 03:18.925
No, no. 9:00 is fine. I'll see you then.

03:19.005 --> 03:20.605
Okay.

03:24.965 --> 03:27.285
It's going to be a little hectic for a while.

03:28.485 --> 03:31.725
Well, you should try and get some sleep.
You look exhausted.

04:10.005 --> 04:12.925
- You're up and about early.
- Tests. Not ready.

04:13.605 --> 04:17.045
- Don't miss those days.
- Yeah, thanks.

04:18.404 --> 04:21.964
- How's school? Life?
- Yeah, pretty good. Usual.

04:22.685 --> 04:25.125
- You and Lindsay?
- Uh, we're good.

04:26.045 --> 04:27.765
You know, we're good.

04:31.325 --> 04:35.925
- There was definite hesitation.
- Eh, no, no, just studying.

04:36.925 --> 04:39.725
Ryan, whatever you did, it can be undone.

04:40.005 --> 04:42.205
Candies, flowers, work miracles.

04:42.405 --> 04:45.845
Actually, it's not something I did, although thanks for your confidence.

04:47.045 --> 04:50.165
- It's your dad.
- Ah, the one man impervious to miracles.

04:50.925 --> 04:54.965
- What happened?
- Well, Lindsay reached out to him, or I did for her.

04:55.205 --> 04:58.405
There was a meal...
Or there was supposed to be a meal.

05:00.165 --> 05:02.765
- We went to a restaurant.
- Poor girl. What did he say?

05:02.925 --> 05:06.325
- He didn't actually take out his checkbook, but he might as well have.
- He thought she wanted money?

05:08.085 --> 05:11.525
He must have got her confused with my other sister... Or his wife.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.965
Look, I'm not the biggest fan of your dad, no offense.

05:14.205 --> 05:18.245
But I mean, Luke Skywalker was happy to have a dad, even if he was Darth Vader.

05:19.565 --> 05:23.925
You're right. She needs a dad. I'll handle this. There's going to be another meal.

05:24.165 --> 05:28.205
Here, and actual food will be eaten. And I'll make sure that he behaves himself.

05:29.685 --> 05:32.805
- Oh, my God. Did we really drink that much last night?
- Uh, we drank that much here.

05:33.085 --> 05:35.085
Who knew you harbor chicks could throw down?

05:35.205 --> 05:37.685
Yeah, well, I'm not like the other girls.

05:37.885 --> 05:40.565
Well, then I guess it's about time I show you the meth lab in the basement.

05:40.685 --> 05:43.245
I thought you'd never ask.

05:46.045 --> 05:49.645
So, I guess you have to go to school.
Say hi to Seth for me.

05:49.765 --> 05:52.725
I kind of miss his little chicken arms.
What's he been up to?

05:52.965 --> 05:56.765
- He hasn't bugged me for a while.
- Um, I don't know, but  I was

05:56.885 --> 06:00.965
kind of thinking of skipping school today.
I mean, how much is there to learn about the Aztecs anyway?

06:01.285 --> 06:04.045
- Nothing, really.
- That's exactly what I was thinking.

06:04.285 --> 06:06.565
So, what do you want to do?

06:08.765 --> 06:11.885
- Well, you ready for that surf lesson?
- Yes! Awesome!

06:12.165 --> 06:14.525
Let me just jump in the shower,
if that's okay?

06:18.565 --> 06:23.125
Do you have another shirt I can borrow? 'Cause this one kind of smells like cigarettes.

06:27.365 --> 06:31.965
So, who would have thought Sandy Cohen would be living in Newport Beach, surrounded by all these surfers?

06:32.165 --> 06:35.965
- It's been 22 years.
- You say that like it's a long time.

06:36.725 --> 06:39.165
- So, you have two kids, huh?
- Yup.

06:39.365 --> 06:41.885
Who'd you end up marrying?
Wait, let me guess.

06:41.965 --> 06:45.605
Left-wing radical from Long Island, reformed?

06:45.765 --> 06:48.805
Yup, that's it. Not even close.

06:49.525 --> 06:53.165
Rich, conservative, Presbyterian...

06:53.445 --> 06:55.845
She grew up right, well, here, basically.

06:55.925 --> 06:58.805
Blonde, blue eyes, cute little nose
like a button.

07:00.325 --> 07:02.405
You're full of surprises.

07:02.685 --> 07:04.805
How'd she take the news about my return?

07:05.085 --> 07:07.325
I haven't told her yet.

07:08.205 --> 07:10.445
I don't want her to be considered an accomplice,

07:10.525 --> 07:14.645
- what with my harboring a fugitive.
- Yeah, that I am.

07:15.485 --> 07:17.685
So, what about you? Are you married?

07:17.805 --> 07:20.245
You got those five kids you always wanted to have?

07:20.925 --> 07:24.085
Not even close. I haven't met anybody since you.

07:25.925 --> 07:29.125
It's kind of hard to meet people when you can't let anybody know

07:29.365 --> 07:32.525
who  you really are, and you can't stay in one place too long.

07:32.925 --> 07:35.685
- I can see how that might salt your game.
- Salt my game?

07:35.965 --> 07:38.165
Is that how they talk in Orange County?

07:38.285 --> 07:40.405
Stick around. You'll be saying "rad" in no time.

07:41.405 --> 07:44.645
Except I'm not staying. I figured I'd

07:45.965 --> 07:49.805
hang out in my lovely accommodations at the Fleabag Inn

07:50.725 --> 07:55.525
for another 48 hours. Spend this time with my dad. Then disappear.

07:56.805 --> 07:59.725
- You're leaving?
- How can I stay?

08:01.245 --> 08:03.925
You said yourself I'm a fugitive.

08:04.205 --> 08:07.525
The feds are looking for me.
I don't want to get you in any trouble.

08:07.805 --> 08:12.365
-  Does he know you're leaving so soon?
- I was hoping you'd help me out with that.

08:18.005 --> 08:20.085
So, what do you want for dinner?

08:20.285 --> 08:23.045
- Why, are you inviting me over?
- Kirsten is.

08:23.405 --> 08:27.565
- Great. So, who's going to be there?
- Me, you, Kirsten... ( coughing ) Caleb.

08:32.284 --> 08:35.885
- Caleb.
- Why? One horrible dining experience wasn't enough?

08:36.085 --> 08:38.485
Kirsten just feels bad about what happened at our dinner.

08:39.365 --> 08:41.645
- You told her.
- She wants to help.

08:41.804 --> 08:46.165
I don't want her help. I don't want your help. And I definitely don't want to dine with Caleb Nichol.

08:46.885 --> 08:50.365
All right, look. Luke Skywalker was happy to find his dad, right?

08:50.445 --> 08:52.725
Even if he turned out to be Darth Vader.

08:52.845 --> 08:56.085
Ryan, Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader fought each other

08:56.165 --> 08:58.925
with light sabers until one of them died.

08:59.005 --> 09:01.245
Vader cut off Skywalker's hand.

09:01.565 --> 09:05.085
- Well, when you put it that way...
- Look, just don't worry about my family

09:05.885 --> 09:09.565
or our family, whatever they are.
Just let it be, okay?

09:14.525 --> 09:17.925
Kirsten, what a pleasure to see you in my office.

09:21.445 --> 09:24.485
Your yogalates or cardio bar,

09:24.605 --> 09:27.365
or whatever it is you've been up to is working wonders on your figure.

09:27.605 --> 09:30.365
And that top, it's, it's so fetching.

09:30.805 --> 09:32.645
"Fetching." Are you done?

09:32.805 --> 09:36.005
Done what? Done complimenting my beautiful daughter on how beautiful she is?

09:36.245 --> 09:38.325
Dad, I need you to do me a favor.

09:38.765 --> 09:41.645
I need you to have dinner with me, Lindsay, and Ryan,

09:41.765 --> 09:44.005
And I need you to not be the world's biggest ass.

09:44.125 --> 09:47.005
- What are you talking about?
- You accused her of wanting money.

09:47.165 --> 09:49.525
Not that you've ever viewed that as a personality flaw before.

09:49.725 --> 09:52.725
She turned up with that inland street thug

09:53.645 --> 09:55.605
Dad, listen up.

09:56.205 --> 10:00.525
Ryan, the assumed street thug, has been living with us for a year and a half now.

10:00.765 --> 10:04.285
He is a brother to Seth, and a son to me and Sandy.

10:04.405 --> 10:07.445
I still question his motives.
I'm just protective of my family.

10:07.685 --> 10:11.525
This girl wants to know her father.
She wants to get to know you.

10:11.845 --> 10:14.485
Tonight, you are going to show up for dinner

10:14.685 --> 10:18.685
and you are going to be a real dad to this
girl, or you're going to lose two daughters

10:19.045 --> 10:20.565
got it?

10:22.605 --> 10:25.205
Dad, I can't stay. I'm already endangering you and Sandy.

10:25.445 --> 10:27.845
So I'm going to lose you all over again?

10:28.045 --> 10:31.765
- We really don't have a choice here.
- Of course we do. The choice we always had, Sandy.

10:32.005 --> 10:36.085
I'm not turning myself in. You know how long it would be before I go to court?
We'd have no time together.

10:36.205 --> 10:40.205
All I want is to see you clear your name to get your life back.

10:40.365 --> 10:44.365
- It's going to be very hard to do considering what happened.
- Except it didn't happen, Sandy.

10:45.165 --> 10:46.325
Tell him, Rebecca.

10:47.765 --> 10:49.245
Tell me what?

10:51.925 --> 10:53.765
That night, I never showed.

10:53.925 --> 10:57.325
I got scared. Sukowsky had to go it alone.

11:00.805 --> 11:03.165
I knew it. Why'd you run?

11:03.445 --> 11:07.725
I panicked. I knew if I got caught,
I'd have to testify against my friends.

11:07.845 --> 11:09.965
Sandy, you could defend her.
You could clear her name.

11:10.085 --> 11:13.325
We can't ask him to put himself at risk like that. He has a family now.

11:13.485 --> 11:16.165
Before you left, we were his family.

11:17.045 --> 11:20.765
Sandy, please, I am begging you.
Give my daughter her life back.

11:35.325 --> 11:36.725
Is that Marissa?

11:36.925 --> 11:39.525
Yeah, or as I like to call her, Cosmo Girl

11:39.805 --> 11:42.685
with a passion for fashion and a magic flask

11:42.885 --> 11:46.045
Alcoholism as a superpower.
Well, that is an interesting take.

11:46.445 --> 11:48.365
You must think Marissa is super-hot.

11:48.525 --> 11:52.125
You're not going to, like, draw me all short and stumpy, are you, to, like, punish me for not liking you anymore?

11:52.485 --> 11:57.325
- This is kind of my concern.
You and me and the artistic process...
- What about it?

11:57.565 --> 12:01.045
You and I have a history, and I'm a little concerned that it's going to compromise my vision.

12:02.525 --> 12:04.525
Are you writing me out?

12:04.685 --> 12:07.405
Oh, I will compromise your vision.
Do not forget about my rage blackouts.

12:07.565 --> 12:09.405
I have not. In fact, it's part of your superpowers.

12:09.525 --> 12:11.325
- Really?
- Yeah, it's very Hulk-like.

12:11.645 --> 12:14.005
But I'm not going to, like, turn green, am I?

12:14.285 --> 12:17.165
Oh, this is your way to make me rip off all of my clothes.

12:17.365 --> 12:19.565
That right there. It's our history.
It's affecting the work.

12:19.725 --> 12:22.125
Are you forgetting about our third partner, Zach?

12:22.325 --> 12:25.565
Superhero nickname, "The Boyfriend",
has the power to make me forget you.

12:25.685 --> 12:28.565
I'm just saying, high stress, late nights,

12:28.765 --> 12:31.565
close quarters... I hope it doesn't, but I don't know. It could get weird.

12:33.165 --> 12:34.605
- You think?
- Well...

12:34.845 --> 12:38.245
Hey, guys! I got great news. My dad has

12:38.565 --> 12:41.565
an intern whose uncle works at Wildstorm.

12:41.685 --> 12:43.125
- Really?
- What's Wildstorm?

12:43.205 --> 12:44.845
Unbelievable comic book company.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.485
- I pitched them the shape of the idea.
- Well, Zach, we don't really have...

12:47.725 --> 12:52.005
They love the world of Orange County.
They think it could be really hot right now.

12:52.125 --> 12:55.085
They said if they like the artwork, they might want to set up a meeting.

12:55.205 --> 12:57.245
- All right.
- So get ready, man.

12:57.365 --> 13:00.165
Late nights, high stress, close quarters...

13:00.485 --> 13:02.965
- Oh, and Cohen, you got to nail Summer.
- What?

13:03.125 --> 13:06.605
- Excuse me?
- I pitched them her character, Little Miss Vixen, with her designer handbags

13:06.725 --> 13:10.085
- full of killer credit cards. They loved her.
- They did? They love me.

13:10.205 --> 13:13.085
But we got to lock down her likeness.
You got to start drawing her right away.

13:13.205 --> 13:15.085
- Okay.
- Like tonight.

13:16.365 --> 13:19.405
So I'll be posing for Cohen tonight?

13:20.005 --> 13:22.125
- It's fine.
- This is going to be great.

13:22.365 --> 13:24.685
- Great.
- So great.

13:28.748 --> 13:29.748
Hey.

13:32.148 --> 13:35.108
We're not having a party, are we?
One never knows.

13:35.188 --> 13:37.108
No,  it's just dinner with my dad.

13:38.148 --> 13:40.588
Don't worry. You're not invited.

13:42.388 --> 13:45.068
Oh. Well, good. I should probably get back to the office anyway.

13:48.588 --> 13:51.428
- You working with Max?
- Yeah.

13:52.348 --> 13:54.668
- What's there left to do?
- Everything.

13:59.068 --> 14:02.468
What if I told you he wants me to clear Rebecca's name, prove she was innocent?

14:02.628 --> 14:04.508
I would think that would be wonderful.

14:04.948 --> 14:07.428
- You would?
- The man's daughter died,

14:07.588 --> 14:10.948
and if you can't bring his daughter back,
at least you can clear her name.

14:12.228 --> 14:14.148
I knew you'd understand.

14:15.508 --> 14:18.708
- Why aren't you dressed?
Is Lindsay here?
- Lindsay isn't coming.

14:18.868 --> 14:20.548
- Why?
- 'Cause Caleb's coming.

14:20.708 --> 14:23.708
- I know. That was the idea. Go and get her
- Gotten in the middle enough.

14:23.868 --> 14:27.708
- Didn't you use that Luke Skywalker,
Darth Vader thing?
- She poked a serious hole in that analogy

14:27.868 --> 14:32.428
Look, my father is on his way over here, and if Lindsay doesn't show up, we're going to be having dinner with him...alone.

14:33.108 --> 14:35.988
That's a good point. I just don't think there's anything I can say.

14:36.708 --> 14:38.548
Maybe you're right.

14:40.548 --> 14:43.228
Forks on the left, soup spoons on the right.

14:50.228 --> 14:53.548
- What's this?
- Oh, it's something Seth drew.

14:53.668 --> 14:57.908
It's a demon water polo player, I guess.
He left it here.

14:59.108 --> 15:01.948
Maybe in ten years, I'll sell it on eBay or something.

15:02.988 --> 15:05.068
So, what's the deal with you guys?

15:05.228 --> 15:09.348
We never really left the ground, you know? We taxied down the runway, but never achieved liftoff.

15:09.468 --> 15:11.308
Yeah, I just got out of one of those.

15:11.468 --> 15:15.588
- Yeah, well, they're good for getting over someone, I guess.
- Or getting you ready for someone.

15:18.548 --> 15:23.468
Can I crash at your place again? Anything to avoid hanging out with my stepdad.

15:23.948 --> 15:26.748
Works for me, but...

15:29.268 --> 15:33.028
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.
- What are you doing with me?

15:35.028 --> 15:37.908
Picking up a pint of Cherry Garcia and renting some DVDs?

15:38.388 --> 15:43.348
I mean, sleeping over, hanging out all the time, borrowing my clothes...

15:44.668 --> 15:48.068
Things that never happened with Seth, and I was dating him.

15:48.308 --> 15:50.748
Well, Seth's not really your size.

15:51.108 --> 15:54.748
No, but he was, however briefly,
my boyfriend.

15:55.628 --> 16:00.108
Maybe you're right.
I should probably sleep at home anyway.
I'm out of fresh clothes as it is.

16:01.988 --> 16:04.428
And I'll wash this shirt, get it back to you

16:04.628 --> 16:06.908
No, don't worry about it.

16:27.028 --> 16:29.388
I'm almost done practicing, Mom.

16:31.068 --> 16:33.588
Not your mom. Your sister.

16:34.348 --> 16:38.948
- I didn't know you played the oboe.
- Not well. I just started practicing again.

16:39.028 --> 16:43.268
- It sounds great. What was that?
- It was Brahms, an orchestral piece.

16:43.948 --> 16:48.468
- You know who likes Brahms?
- Yeah. I'm not going to dinner

16:48.668 --> 16:51.108
even if Caleb is a huge fan of the oboe.

16:51.868 --> 16:55.588
Look, no one has been more thoroughly crushed by our dad than me.

16:55.748 --> 16:59.268
- Now, there's a club I want to join.
- He's got a lot of issues.

16:59.468 --> 17:02.468
He's not the easiest guy in the world to get along with,

17:02.708 --> 17:06.068
- but once you figure him out,
he's really a good guy.
- Really?

17:06.387 --> 17:09.748
I don't know. I've never been able to figure him out,

17:11.068 --> 17:14.268
but maybe we can try... together.

17:18.228 --> 17:21.348
It's not much, but the couch is pretty comfy

17:21.428 --> 17:24.228
and we've got air conditioning. Well, we don't have air conditioning, but we have windows.

17:24.308 --> 17:26.188
- Carpeting, very lush.
- It's private.

17:26.348 --> 17:28.308
- And the price? You can't beat it.
- It's great, Sandy.

17:28.708 --> 17:31.188
It's perfect. I mean, it'll be fine for the next 48 hours.

17:31.548 --> 17:35.308
It might take me a little longer than that to figure out how to take on your case.

17:38.228 --> 17:40.548
You are? You will?

17:48.068 --> 17:49.588
Thank you.

17:56.548 --> 17:59.388
I mean, um... thanks.

17:59.588 --> 18:03.588
I know I said I didn't want your help, but
I kind of did.

18:04.668 --> 18:06.708
I kind of knew that.

18:10.348 --> 18:12.308
- Have you told your wife yet
- No.

18:12.828 --> 18:16.708
- Sandy?
- She can't know anything yet, not until we get this sorted out.

18:18.668 --> 18:21.388
I don't like it, but...
it's the best thing for her.

18:24.348 --> 18:28.828
Okay, that's your decision.
My dad's going to be thrilled.

18:29.788 --> 18:32.268
- We should celebrate.
- Yeah, I'll go rent out Chuck E. Cheese.

18:33.028 --> 18:37.908
I know we can't go out, but we could order in Mexican, grab a bottle of tequila.

18:39.348 --> 18:41.388
- Still like pachung?
- Yeah.

18:41.988 --> 18:44.828
- Yeah? Smoke a little weed?
- ( laughs ): Cool.

18:45.508 --> 18:48.788
Yeah, while I'm harboring a fugitive, I'll go and score some pot off the street.

18:52.708 --> 18:55.428
Never leave home without it.
Happen to have a bong handy?

18:55.748 --> 18:57.308
Not these days, no.

18:58.028 --> 19:00.988
My son Seth is... he's quite the detective.

19:02.348 --> 19:06.828
If my memory serves, Sandy Cohen could turn just about anything into a pipe.

19:07.108 --> 19:09.948
Soda can... apple...

19:10.388 --> 19:14.748
- Do we get to listen to the Allman Brothers, too?
- Depends if you've got an apple.

19:19.948 --> 19:22.388
Let's just stick to the tequila.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.708
- Hello.
- Hmm, come in.

19:31.348 --> 19:34.668
Nice to see you dress up for the occasion.

19:38.908 --> 19:41.908
- Ready?
- Yeah, just a second.

19:43.908 --> 19:45.188
Um... go ahead.

19:52.388 --> 19:54.108
Oh, my God.

19:58.348 --> 20:02.588
What? It's my costume.
I told you I had wardrobe approval.

20:02.988 --> 20:06.148
Look, if it was up to you, I'd be wearing shredded purple jeans and pasties.

20:06.268 --> 20:08.228
No, this is better. This is much better.

20:08.388 --> 20:11.788
Okay, come on. Let's be professional.
Less drooling, more drawing.

20:13.068 --> 20:17.228
- And don't give me any junk in the trunk, either.
- It's just the gifts God gave you.

20:31.628 --> 20:36.908
You think you can maybe turn, like, 40 degrees but keep your face tilted towards the light,

20:38.028 --> 20:40.388
- and then hold your arms akimbo.
- A what-bo?

21:04.828 --> 21:06.308
Okay. This way.

21:08.188 --> 21:11.148
Turn your face out this way a little bit.

21:20.588 --> 21:24.908
- Are your greasy paws done manhandling me?
- Yeah. You look good.

21:28.388 --> 21:31.468
- Did you just draw that? Right now?
- but you just stepped out of the light!

21:38.188 --> 21:41.468
You know, I wish I could draw, but every time I try to draw a person,

21:41.868 --> 21:45.308
it's just one big head with legs coming out of its chin.

21:45.428 --> 21:48.308
Look how you're holding the pencil.
You're choking it.

21:48.468 --> 21:52.028
- No, I am not. This pencil can breathe on its own.
- Yeah, well, the guy with no neck can't.

21:52.228 --> 21:54.428
- Loosen up a little bit.
- Okay.

21:56.228 --> 21:59.348
Just take it nice and easy.

22:03.148 --> 22:07.028
Picasso said, "First you have to be able to draw a straight line."

22:23.148 --> 22:27.268
I think I've got all the angles I need.
I can do the rest from memory.

22:27.668 --> 22:31.028
Good, 'cause, my costume's starting
to ride me.

22:31.668 --> 22:35.988
Excellent.  I'll come back for
Princess Sparkle later.

22:56.788 --> 22:59.108
This is the best meal you ever cooked, Kiki.

22:59.548 --> 23:02.828
It's fondue, Dad. Cheese pot,
not so difficult.

23:11.108 --> 23:13.228
Did you know that Lindsay plays the oboe?

23:14.868 --> 23:17.908
- Not well.
- Do you now?

23:18.468 --> 23:21.668
- Do you play any Brahms?
- I try.

23:26.388 --> 23:29.028
Did you know that Dad has box seats at the Hollywood Bowl?

23:29.228 --> 23:31.628
- Have you ever been?
- No, I heard it's amazing.

23:31.988 --> 23:34.668
- Tickets are yours.
- Great.

23:36.388 --> 23:38.108
Ryan? What do you think?

23:38.428 --> 23:41.148
A little Essa Peka, a little Yo-Yo Ma?

23:41.548 --> 23:44.428
- I don't think Ryan would be interested.
- Dad.

23:45.508 --> 23:48.948
What, I'm just saying, a boy like Ryan would probably get bored with a show like that.

23:50.148 --> 23:54.108
- Right, 'cause they don't have music in Chino.
- It's fine. Just let him insult me.

23:54.908 --> 23:58.828
I didn't mean to insult you. I just had no idea that you were a classical music fan.

24:00.588 --> 24:04.028
- What's your favorite Brahms concerto?
- Ryan, I'm so sorry.

24:04.268 --> 24:09.068
No, it's fine. You know what? I'm just going to go. This was supposed to be about Lindsay and Caleb making up for lost time.

24:10.028 --> 24:13.068
- What are you insinuating?
- It's just you guys have a lot to catch up on.

24:13.188 --> 24:14.988
I'd hate to see you waste all your time insulting me.

24:16.468 --> 24:18.268
Ryan, stay.

24:18.428 --> 24:20.868
Yes, Ryan, stay as long as you like.

24:21.028 --> 24:25.028
Living in this house, eating our food, dating our children, butting in to our affairs.

24:25.228 --> 24:27.628
- You are so out of line.
- What?

24:27.828 --> 24:32.028
I've forgiven him for burning down my model home, for teaching my grandson how to steal cars,

24:32.268 --> 24:34.948
and for starting a brawl at my Man-of-the-Year party,

24:35.108 --> 24:37.508
and everyone seems to have forgotten that he impregnated a girl.

24:37.868 --> 24:40.908
Something you might know a thing or two about, except I didn't pay her off to stay quiet.

24:42.788 --> 24:45.508
- What did you say to me?
- I'm just telling you the truth.

24:45.628 --> 24:49.028
- And you can try and hide it from Lindsay, make this all about me.
- I've had just about enough out of you.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.108
- That's too bad, 'cause I'm just getting started.
- Ryan.

24:51.308 --> 24:54.348
- Let me tell you something,
if you've come here for a fight...
- Dad. Ryan, don't.

24:59.908 --> 25:01.068
Dad?!

25:11.428 --> 25:15.028
Oh, my God. Call 911. Dad!

25:24.321 --> 25:26.161
That's the last time I try cooking.

25:26.321 --> 25:30.801
I'm starving. There's got to be a vending machine to raid around here.

25:30.881 --> 25:32.841
- I'd love some coffee.
- Yeah, let me get that.

25:33.201 --> 25:35.361
Hey, Lindsay, you want to come?

25:37.721 --> 25:38.921
I'll stay here.

25:45.401 --> 25:49.481
I'm here. I'm sorry. Not that I haven't wished it on the man, but

25:50.201 --> 25:52.601
- how's he doing?
- I haven't heard yet. I was worried about you.

25:52.761 --> 25:55.561
- Oh, I was working late.
- Have you been drinking?

25:55.681 --> 25:57.801
- Kirsten Cohen?
- Ah, yes.

25:58.161 --> 26:00.641
I'm Dr. Stephen Lasser. I was with your father all night.

26:00.801 --> 26:03.881
- Let me say, he's going to be okay.
- Oh, thank God.

26:04.001 --> 26:07.921
He did, however, suffer a mild heart attack and we're going to have to run some tests

26:08.081 --> 26:11.561
- and keep him here a day or two, but nothing to worry about.
- Can we see him?

26:11.761 --> 26:15.961
- Well, visits are restricted to family.
- I'm his daughter.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.841
Then right this way.

26:19.321 --> 26:22.161
- Are you coming?
- In a second.

26:24.361 --> 26:27.121
I was thinking...
you around my dad, right now?

26:27.401 --> 26:30.041
- Probably not the best thing for his blood pressure.
- Probably not.

26:30.161 --> 26:32.801
I understand. I've got plenty of work to do
at the office.

26:32.961 --> 26:35.721
- But I'll stay if you want me to.
- No, I have Lindsay, Ryan and Seth.

26:40.921 --> 26:43.921
- Oh, my God. You almost kissed him?
- Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

26:44.001 --> 26:47.041
Eh, whatever. It's just Caleb.
Ryan said he'll be fine.

26:47.361 --> 26:51.481
Besides, he's like a cockroach, you know?
He'll outlive us all.

26:52.561 --> 26:55.521
- Again, you almost kissed Cohen?
- It was not an almost kiss.

26:55.641 --> 26:59.041
- It was a nose graze. Totally different.
- Not totally.

26:59.281 --> 27:02.481
Sometimes you can just have, like,
a moment with someone.

27:03.121 --> 27:06.361
You know, when you're doing something totally random and

27:06.681 --> 27:10.481
it's just, like, charged, or something.

27:11.281 --> 27:15.161
- Who you been nose-grazing with?
- What? No one. I just mean...

27:17.201 --> 27:20.841
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah, like, even if you're dating a totally hot guy that really likes you,

27:21.121 --> 27:24.681
you can still get flustered by a bobble-headed geek in size 27 jeans.

27:25.881 --> 27:27.281
- What is that?
- I don't know.

27:27.521 --> 27:30.961
- What are you supposed to do about it?
- I think it depends on who the person is.

27:31.241 --> 27:32.801
If it's Cohen,

27:32.961 --> 27:36.521
I think you need to use all your weapons and your designer handbag to defend yourself.

27:36.761 --> 27:38.921
If it's a normal person, you go for it.

27:40.641 --> 27:45.401
- What if it's someone whose nose you never thought you'd graze?
- Do you mean like Princess Sparkle?

27:48.081 --> 27:53.241
You are young, you are single, and you have a cute nose. So why not put it out there?

27:55.641 --> 27:59.121
Are you comfortable? Do you need anything from home? Slippers, robe?

27:59.281 --> 28:01.801
No, no, I'm... I'm fine. Thanks.

28:04.241 --> 28:05.881
Actually, I've never been better.

28:07.041 --> 28:09.121
Are you on morphine?

28:10.881 --> 28:12.761
I owe you both a huge apology.

28:12.961 --> 28:16.801
It's just a shame it took a coronary for me to realize how terrible I've been and I've been terrible.

28:16.881 --> 28:21.081
- Dad, it's okay.
- It's not okay, but now that I've got a second chance,

28:21.961 --> 28:23.721
I'd like a second chance.

28:40.441 --> 28:42.361
Can we start over?

28:43.521 --> 28:46.841
Whatever makes you feel any better.
I didn't even think I liked you.

28:48.281 --> 28:51.561
- Until I thought I lost you.
- Does that mean you forgive me?

28:54.921 --> 28:57.001
Okay. Yeah.

29:04.121 --> 29:07.241
- Am I going to jail?
- Not necessarily.

29:10.161 --> 29:14.281
Clearing your name is probably impossible.
It's not going to be easy.

29:14.521 --> 29:17.321
With your permission, I'd like to explore some kind of amnesty, a plea bargain,

29:17.441 --> 29:21.601
- to keep you out of jail so you can be with your dad.
- Yeah, that's what's important here.

29:21.921 --> 29:24.681
- What can we do?
I'm going to need a statement of fact,

29:24.841 --> 29:28.721
your story. And then we can track down any witnesses who can corroborate the truth.

29:29.041 --> 29:31.161
But first...

29:32.041 --> 29:34.841
I've got to call my wife. Excuse me.

29:42.881 --> 29:45.681
Baby, it's me. I was hoping you'd be there.

29:45.961 --> 29:48.401
I guess we'll catch up back at the ranch for dinner.

29:48.561 --> 29:51.721
Call me if you need anything. I love you.

30:00.841 --> 30:04.561
Maybe you should be with your family,
your wife, given everything.

30:04.721 --> 30:07.921
I don't think she really wants me there.

30:08.161 --> 30:11.441
Her father and I don't exactly get along so well.

30:11.761 --> 30:15.001
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah. The sooner we get started...

30:15.441 --> 30:18.681
- The sooner I'm out of your life and you can have yours back.
- No, it's not like that.

30:20.601 --> 30:22.681
Yeah, it is.

30:23.361 --> 30:26.121
Go home to your wife. We'll work on this in the morning.

30:30.241 --> 30:33.361
- These are probably pretty cold by now.
- Oh, thanks.

30:33.841 --> 30:37.281
I was going to go and give them to you guys, but I didn't want to interrupt.

30:37.441 --> 30:41.281
- Where's Seth?
- He  went home. Shower, do some work.

30:41.441 --> 30:45.041
- Why didn't you go with him?
- I just figured I'd stay here.
Least I could do.

30:45.841 --> 30:48.921
Ryan, nobody blames you for this. Really.

30:52.641 --> 30:54.881
Hey. What's going on?

30:55.521 --> 30:59.761
I just came by to give you this.
It might be worth a lot of money someday.

31:07.401 --> 31:10.041
- Nice house.
- Thanks.

31:10.441 --> 31:14.881
It's good for weekends, and vacations.

31:17.601 --> 31:20.841
So are you seeing anyone?
Multiple people, perhaps?

31:21.081 --> 31:23.801
- Female? Life partner?
- Seth...

31:24.121 --> 31:27.041
- It's a legitimate question.
- Don't make me hurt you in your nice house

31:27.321 --> 31:32.841
- You hurt me enough already, so...
- Come on, I didn't hurt you.

31:34.801 --> 31:36.921
It was never that kind of thing.

31:37.241 --> 31:40.121
I remember you scratching my cornea really bad

31:40.281 --> 31:44.401
- and bending my arm in ways it's not supposed to bend.
- You know what I mean.

31:44.921 --> 31:47.561
We were each other's in between people.

31:47.721 --> 31:51.801
You helped me get over Jody. And...
I helped you get over...

31:54.121 --> 31:55.241
Summer.

32:01.881 --> 32:04.521
It's kind of cool, actually.

32:06.201 --> 32:09.681
We helped get each other ready
for what's next.

32:10.241 --> 32:15.001
- Well, good luck with that.
- Good luck with Summer.

32:23.721 --> 32:27.881
- Look at this.
- Well, I figured you could use a home-cooked meal.

32:28.241 --> 32:31.561
- It's grilled salmon in a
raspberry coulis reduction.
- My favorite.

32:31.641 --> 32:34.001
- I know.
- My hero.

32:35.561 --> 32:38.081
- You shaved.
- Well, I clean up nice.

32:39.601 --> 32:42.761
So, you've been working hard.
It's a good thing you got the new office.

32:42.881 --> 32:47.881
- How do you like it?
- It's a little rough around the edges.
It's just my style.

32:48.041 --> 32:50.641
If you're going to be spending a lot of time there, you'll need to spruce it up.

32:50.841 --> 32:53.521
I like it un-spruced.

32:53.681 --> 32:58.561
While you are whipping up a culinary miracle, I'm going to go to the store and pick up some things for my dad.

32:58.801 --> 33:02.241
- I love you.
- I love you.

33:22.361 --> 33:23.761
- Cohen.
- Summer.

33:25.241 --> 33:26.481
You...

33:28.841 --> 33:30.841
- So, I...
- Yeah, I been thinking.

33:31.241 --> 33:33.641
- Sorry, go.
- No, no, you go first.

33:34.041 --> 33:35.961
Yes, okay. I'm go

33:38.361 --> 33:42.801
I'm not happy with the...
shadings of my sketches.

33:42.921 --> 33:46.401
I'm glad to hear that, because I have made some modifications to my costume.

33:46.521 --> 33:49.801
- And Princess Sparkle now has a cape.
- Nice touch, fantastic.

33:49.961 --> 33:53.081
I always say, every four-legged sidekick,
they need a cape.

33:53.321 --> 33:56.161
- Yes.
- I always say that...

33:57.321 --> 34:00.041
- So, do you need to draw me again?
- No, that's not necessary.

34:00.121 --> 34:03.441
That is not necessary. I've got your image. It's just seared in my memory.

34:04.241 --> 34:08.281
Good. I think. I look forward to seeing what you come up with.

34:09.521 --> 34:11.761
Here's the thing.

34:12.201 --> 34:17.081
I just think that the best way for us...
to maintain a professional relationship...

34:17.161 --> 34:18.960
..is to spend as little time together as possible?

34:19.121 --> 34:20.721
- Yes, exactly.
- Good.

34:21.561 --> 34:23.001
- Who's ready for a road trip?
- What?

34:23.321 --> 34:26.121
I just talked to the guy at Wildstorm.
He loved your drawings.

34:26.281 --> 34:29.801
I set up a meeting.
We're going to San Diego
Just the three of us!

34:32.761 --> 34:34.440
- That's great.
- Great.

36:57.041 --> 37:00.961
- This is my fault.
- No, it's no one's fault.

37:03.841 --> 37:07.161
But I think Caleb has changed.

37:08.361 --> 37:12.161
He really wants a relationship with me.

37:14.921 --> 37:18.001
- That's great.
- Yeah, it is.

37:19.961 --> 37:24.361
It's just... I think that that's going to be pretty hard...

37:24.481 --> 37:27.881
- If I'm around, yeah, I know.
- Look, I know

37:28.721 --> 37:31.081
... that he's going to like you.

37:32.001 --> 37:34.081
I mean, how could he not?

37:37.281 --> 37:39.521
I just think that's going to take some time.

37:41.241 --> 37:44.921
- And he needs me now.
- We'll take some time off. It's not like we haven't done it before.

37:46.041 --> 37:49.321
- first Kirsten, and now my dad.
- You don't want a relationship with
Julie Cooper, do you?

37:49.401 --> 37:52.721
- 'Cause then we'd never see each other.
- Yeah, that's not going to happen.

37:56.041 --> 37:59.761
I know what it's like...
not having a dad. I...

38:01.841 --> 38:03.401
I get it.

38:08.961 --> 38:10.241
Bye.

38:41.601 --> 38:45.561
- Hello.
- It's me. I'm just checking up on you, making sure you're okay.

38:45.761 --> 38:49.361
I was just getting ready to sack out on the couch.

38:49.601 --> 38:53.521
All right. I'll see you in the morning,
and we'll figure this out.

38:53.881 --> 38:56.801
With you leading the charge,
I have no doubt.

38:57.801 --> 39:01.201
- Good night.
- Good night. Thank you.

39:41.561 --> 39:43.321
- Hello?
- Oh, hey, sweetie, it's Mom.

39:43.601 --> 39:47.681
- How's Grandpa?
- He's okay. I just saw him.
Is your dad around?

39:48.481 --> 39:50.881
Hang on. Let me check.

39:52.481 --> 39:53.841
Dad?

39:55.161 --> 39:57.721
I have no idea where he is right now.

39:57.841 --> 40:02.961
Okay, well, I'm going to make a pit stop.
I'm going to drop a few things off at his office. It needs some sprucing up.

40:03.481 --> 40:06.441
- Did you say "sprucing"?
- Yes, I did, indeed.

40:06.641 --> 40:10.881
All right. If he and I should cross paths,
is there anything you want me to tell him?

40:11.361 --> 40:15.681
No, I want it to be a surprise. Just let him know that I'll be home in a few minutes.

40:15.961 --> 40:18.041
All right, I can do that. Bye-bye.

40:20.161 --> 40:21.881
Yeah?

40:22.561 --> 40:25.241
Ryan and I could use a little help
setting the table.

40:25.801 --> 40:27.841
- All right.
- Who called?

40:28.041 --> 40:31.841
- Oh, it was Mom.
- What did she say?
- She's going to be home in a few.

41:00.921 --> 41:03.001
Sandy? Is that you?

41:06.881 --> 41:09.041
Rebecca?
