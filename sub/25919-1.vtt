-The heat gives her the grumpies.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.660
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

03:22.744 --> 03:26.080
I've arranged for a tanker car of water
to come on the next train.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.833
That'll be enough to last
until the rainy season begins.

03:28.917 --> 03:32.420
-[Abigail and Pru sigh]
-But it won't arrive for three days,

03:32.503 --> 03:35.006
so we'll have to ration
our water until then.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.791

Who would ever guess
that Mr. Grayson would wind up town hero?

04:15.964 --> 04:18.007
It's only because
they don't know him like we do.

They're trying to find water,

-but there's none out there.
-Whoa, whoa. Slow down.

05:44.510 --> 05:47.096

Mr. Grayson's well is still full.

-You can buy some from him for the herd.
-I'm sorry. Until the trains get here,

-They'll find a way to survive.
-It's not fair!

06:01.694 --> 06:03.696
How can you even own water?

06:03.780 --> 06:06.574
Water is like air.
It should belong to everyone.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.034
I know it seems unfair,

06:08.117 --> 06:10.953
but the water in Grayson's well belongs
to Grayson.

07:45.381 --> 07:46.883
And what about the herd?

07:46.966 --> 07:49.427
Horses can't pay. So they get nothing?

that every well in Miradero

08:00.897 --> 08:03.399
would go dry except for Grayson's?

Is this a math problem?
I left my protractor at home.

it is kind of strange.

Grayson is a no-good cheat.

11:55.256 --> 11:58.008
You three keep watch.
We're going in for a closer look.

11:59.093 --> 11:59.927
[neighs]

12:00.010 --> 12:01.303
I'm with Spirit.

12:01.387 --> 12:04.056
Can't we take a closer look
without getting any closer?

12:04.140 --> 12:05.307
We have to go in.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.601
I wanna check out Grayson's well
for myself.

12:18.946 --> 12:19.947
It's empty.

12:20.948 --> 12:24.243
-So where is he getting his water?
-[all gasp]

12:29.165 --> 12:31.125
-Should we run?
-We can't.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.335
We need to know what he's up to.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.172
-[horse chuffs]
-[Grayson grunting]

12:38.716 --> 12:41.260

12:43.471 --> 12:44.847

12:45.431 --> 12:46.390

12:49.894 --> 12:52.021
-[all sigh]
-[chuffing]

12:52.688 --> 12:53.647
Come on, you.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.233
Get on with it. You earn your breaks.

12:56.317 --> 12:57.234
[chuffs]

12:59.195 --> 13:01.113
Come on. Let's follow him.

13:06.118 --> 13:09.205
Okay, Spirit, we need to keep close enough
that we don't lose him

13:09.288 --> 13:11.332
but far enough back
that he doesn't see us.

13:11.415 --> 13:13.542
What about Miradero? Is that too far back?

13:13.626 --> 13:15.878
Abigail, we're doing this for the herd.

13:15.961 --> 13:20.382
I know, but Grayson's so mean.
What if he catches us?

13:20.466 --> 13:21.842
Let's make sure he doesn't.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.685
[whinnies]

13:34.063 --> 13:37.066
[whistling]

13:40.194 --> 13:42.613
[whistling fades]

13:42.696 --> 13:45.699
[distant whistling]

13:49.870 --> 13:52.373
[whistling grows louder]

13:52.456 --> 13:53.290
[gasps]

13:53.374 --> 13:55.292
Listen. He's getting closer.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.127
He's seen us. He's coming back.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.380
-[whistling continues]
-No, it's a switchback.

13:59.463 --> 14:01.465
Quick! Hug the mountain.

14:01.549 --> 14:04.343
[whistling continues]

14:04.426 --> 14:06.428
[whinnies]

14:07.930 --> 14:08.764

14:08.847 --> 14:10.474
-[whistling continues]
-[girls gasp]

14:10.558 --> 14:13.644
[grunts sharply] Hmm.

14:17.314 --> 14:18.941
[chuffs]

14:19.024 --> 14:21.277
[sniffing]

14:23.028 --> 14:23.863
[whimpers]

14:32.413 --> 14:35.416
-Hyah! Xerxes, keep on moving.
-[chuffs]

14:36.792 --> 14:38.836
-[Grayson whistling]
-[all sigh]

14:46.302 --> 14:47.511
[whistling fades]

14:49.847 --> 14:51.974
Anyone notice the whistling stopped?

14:52.057 --> 14:53.058
Where's Grayson?

14:53.142 --> 14:55.269
He couldn't have gotten
that far ahead of us.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.692
I'm not sure which is worse:

15:01.775 --> 15:03.944
hearing the whistling
or not hearing the whistling.

15:05.529 --> 15:08.073
[whinnies, chuffs]

15:08.157 --> 15:08.991
[gasps]

15:11.035 --> 15:13.829
Look. These tracks are from Xerxes.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.081
They end right here.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.961
[Pru] It's another trail.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.422
[Grayson whistling]

15:23.505 --> 15:25.674
-[all gasp]
-Hide!

15:25.758 --> 15:29.428
[whistling continues]

15:29.511 --> 15:31.180
[wagon clattering]

15:31.263 --> 15:32.640
[whistling stops]

15:32.723 --> 15:33.599
[Grayson grunts]

15:33.682 --> 15:37.353
Get on, Xerxes. [grunts]

15:39.521 --> 15:42.524
[Grayson whistling]

15:46.362 --> 15:48.030
Should we follow him back down?

15:48.113 --> 15:49.198
[water sloshes]

15:51.533 --> 15:54.161
Water. Let's see what's back there.

15:56.914 --> 15:59.291
Grayson must have found water
up this trail.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.668
That's why he's got it hidden.

16:00.751 --> 16:01.585
[chuffs]

16:09.009 --> 16:09.843
[all gasp]

16:10.678 --> 16:14.264
[Pru] The river didn't dry up.
It's blocked by this landslide.

16:14.348 --> 16:17.559
Leave it to Grayson
to sell everyone in town their own water.

16:17.643 --> 16:21.480
Wait till the... [imitates Grayson]
good people of Miradero hear about this.

16:21.563 --> 16:22.856
[whinnies]

16:22.940 --> 16:24.942
[Abigail] They're gonna be so mad
at Grayson.

16:25.025 --> 16:26.151
[Lucky] We'll tell them.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.904
But first, the herd needs water now.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.864
We have to get the river flowing again.

16:30.948 --> 16:33.742
If we can pry that tree loose,
maybe the water will break through.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.786
You and Abigail take this bank.

16:35.869 --> 16:37.913
Spirit and I will pull
from the other side.

16:42.918 --> 16:44.503
[whinnies]

16:45.462 --> 16:46.296
Pull!

16:46.380 --> 16:50.968
[grunting]

16:56.932 --> 16:59.226
Come on, Spirit. One more big pull.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.478
[grunts]

17:04.481 --> 17:06.400
-Look, it's working!

17:16.076 --> 17:17.243
[Lucky] Governor!

17:17.327 --> 17:18.369
[Abigail] Watch out!

17:19.872 --> 17:20.998
[neighs]

17:21.080 --> 17:22.958
The current is too strong.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.792
We're coming, Governor!

17:24.877 --> 17:26.336
[whinnies]

17:28.964 --> 17:30.924
We've gotta get ahead of him, Spirit!

17:31.008 --> 17:32.468
[Governor whinnying]

17:32.551 --> 17:34.511
-Hyah!
-Faster, Boomerang!

17:34.595 --> 17:36.180
[whinnies]

17:40.893 --> 17:42.061
[Governor whinnies]

17:42.144 --> 17:43.979
Throw me a rope. I can get him.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.401
[Governor whinnies]

17:49.485 --> 17:51.070
Lucky, catch!

-Yeah!

18:09.213 --> 18:10.130
[grunts, shouts]

18:10.214 --> 18:11.048

-Oh, no.

18:28.565 --> 18:30.192
-[grunts]
-[Governor whinnies]

18:32.194 --> 18:35.531
We can do this together, boy.
One step at a time.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.407
-Straight back.
-[whinnies]

18:38.951 --> 18:40.410
[Abigail] Be careful, Lucky!

18:40.494 --> 18:41.662
-[Pru] Whoa!
-[gasps]

18:41.745 --> 18:43.664
-Hurry, Lucky!
-It's gonna break!

18:43.747 --> 18:44.748
Hyah!

18:49.878 --> 18:51.338
-[Governor whinnying]
-[Pru] Governor!

18:51.421 --> 18:53.632

18:55.008 --> 18:57.636
-[Abigail] He's headed for the end!
-[Pru] We've got you!

-[grunts]
-[Pru] You got him!

19:04.726 --> 19:05.686
[Abigail] You did it!

19:06.270 --> 19:07.688
-Yeah!
-Yee-haw!

19:07.771 --> 19:11.024
-[whinnies, pants]
-[grunts]

19:11.108 --> 19:13.527
You're okay now, little guy. We got you.

19:13.610 --> 19:14.778
[whinnies]

19:14.862 --> 19:15.696
[Spirit chuffs]

19:17.823 --> 19:22.077
Mr. Grayson,
when this woeful calamity has passed,

19:22.161 --> 19:24.830
I will see to it personally
that you're given

19:24.913 --> 19:29.334
the key to our fair town
and have a day named in your honor.

19:30.919 --> 19:33.172
Yeah, that's a fine tribute, Mr. Mayor.

19:33.714 --> 19:36.550
-But you owe me $30, by my account.
-Hmm? Oh!

19:36.633 --> 19:39.052
Oh, oh, yes, yes. [chuckles] Of course.

19:39.136 --> 19:40.554
[fountain sputtering]

19:40.637 --> 19:41.680
Daddy.

19:41.763 --> 19:43.515
-[all gasp]
-[Maricela] The fountain!

19:43.599 --> 19:46.560
[all murmuring]

19:46.643 --> 19:48.729
-[Lucky] Don't pay Grayson. He lied.
-Huh?

19:49.605 --> 19:51.732
A landslide was blocking the river.

19:51.815 --> 19:55.110
That's where Grayson's been
getting his supply, not from his well.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.696
He's been selling us our own water!

19:57.779 --> 19:59.781
-[all gasp]
-[Grayson scoffs]

19:59.865 --> 20:01.909
I have every right to that water.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.702
The slide happened on my land.

20:03.785 --> 20:07.331
Dad, don't let him twist things around.
We caught him red-handed.

20:09.374 --> 20:13.670
If the slide was on your property,
you had every right to sell it.

20:13.754 --> 20:16.882
But I think your time
as a water salesman is done.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.510
Oh, and you can forget
about that town key, too.

20:20.594 --> 20:23.222
Well, guess I'll pack it in early, then.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.390
Pleasure doing business with y'all.

20:27.768 --> 20:28.727
Girlie.

20:29.436 --> 20:30.520
Hyah!

20:33.106 --> 20:35.734
That's it? He just gets away with it?

20:35.817 --> 20:38.111
Lucky, what he did was wrong.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.864
Unfortunately, it doesn't mean
it was against the law.

20:40.948 --> 20:44.785
Hey, some folks live their lives
taking advantage of others.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.954
But there are good people
in this world, too.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.938
[Maricela gasps, growls]

21:14.606 --> 21:16.233
[Lucky] I'll never understand.

21:16.316 --> 21:19.111
How can you do the wrong thing
and be on the right side of the law?

21:19.194 --> 21:21.571
-Is this another math problem?
-[Spirit neighs]

21:21.655 --> 21:24.616
Well, I know one thing
that is definitely right.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.201
Look. There's Spirit.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.619
He found Smoke and the herd.
