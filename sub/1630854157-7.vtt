This is the shirt you chose?

00:36.428 --> 00:38.929
Denim, with all the
Warner Brothers characters

00:38.947 --> 00:40.021
peeking out of the pocket?

00:40.041 --> 00:42.099
Yeah, it's the fanciest shirt
I have.

00:42.192 --> 00:45.026
But Warner Brothers wouldn't
license their actual characters.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.287
Eh, how are you, Doctor?

00:47.381 --> 00:49.106
Oh, my God,
will you look at this?

00:49.241 --> 00:51.717
Bonnie's latest post has
43 likes.

00:51.944 --> 00:53.719
That's tied for the record.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.283
That's good, but it should say,
"Pretty good view from<i> here."</i>

00:59.301 --> 01:01.894
No, no, no, it's because
she's at the pier.

01:02.121 --> 01:05.122
So... I love that.

01:05.140 --> 01:07.124
-(phone chimes)
-LOIS: Damn it, Peter,

01:07.126 --> 01:08.975
now she's got
the Spooner Street record.

01:09.128 --> 01:10.977
PETER: Hang on, I'm texting
Quagmire and Cleveland.

01:11.130 --> 01:12.312
They gotta see this.

01:12.464 --> 01:15.074
(phone chimes)

01:15.301 --> 01:17.493
(indistinct chatter)

01:18.746 --> 01:20.895
Hey, kids, I'm Mr. Andy,
and I just invented

01:20.989 --> 01:23.156
this really crazy game.

01:23.309 --> 01:25.659
One person hides
in a top secret spot,

01:25.753 --> 01:28.921
and the others count to ten,
then try and find him.

01:29.148 --> 01:31.757
We'll call it, oh, I don't know,
"hide-and-seek"?

01:31.908 --> 01:34.909
I say, one game covering
covert activity,

01:34.929 --> 01:36.820
surveillance and counting?

01:36.839 --> 01:40.173
I would follow this man into
the very bowels of hell.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.008
All right, who wants
to hide first?

01:42.161 --> 01:43.844
Oh, me, me.

01:43.996 --> 01:46.087
Looks like we have
our first little hider.

01:46.107 --> 01:49.499
I'm so glad they didn't fire you
for giving us baths.

01:49.593 --> 01:53.503
Okay, it's time to bid on our
final donated item of the night:

01:53.522 --> 01:56.173
a romantic Vermont
weekend getaway.

01:56.266 --> 01:57.783
(gasp)
Peter, we have to win.

01:57.934 --> 02:00.677
Vermont is an Instagram
goldmine.

02:00.696 --> 02:02.121
I could shatter Bonnie's record.

02:02.272 --> 02:03.271
Lois, we can't afford...

02:03.365 --> 02:04.772
I'll take you to Ben & Jerry's.

02:04.867 --> 02:06.792
I have $600 taped
to my stomach.

02:07.019 --> 02:08.127
$600!

02:08.278 --> 02:09.944
Sold.
There were no other bids.

02:10.038 --> 02:12.539
You could have had it for $40.

02:12.691 --> 02:14.374
(stammering)

02:14.526 --> 02:16.877
That concludes this scene,
ladies and gentlemen.

02:17.029 --> 02:18.345
(slide whistle)

02:23.126 --> 02:25.218
Chris, what-- Oh, who cares?

02:25.371 --> 02:26.887
We're in Vermont till Sunday.

02:26.981 --> 02:29.890
Call if you have to
but, like, let's not call.

02:30.042 --> 02:32.133
Can we only brush our teeth
for 60 seconds

02:32.227 --> 02:33.801
instead of the full 90?

02:33.821 --> 02:35.896
You brush your teeth? Nerd.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.714
And remember, kids,
if you get nervous,

02:37.733 --> 02:40.400
you can always turn on
the home security system.

02:40.552 --> 02:43.887
That's right.
The keypad code is 6969.

02:43.906 --> 02:45.146
If your mother doesn't want
to do it,

02:45.166 --> 02:46.556
at least she can type it.

02:46.650 --> 02:48.500
You're a legend, Dad.

02:52.247 --> 02:54.173
Hey, Brian, can you find me?

02:54.400 --> 02:57.067
What the--
Is that a talking blanket?

02:57.085 --> 02:59.011
It's me.
It's crazy, right?

02:59.238 --> 03:01.421
It's this brand-new game
called hide-and-seek.

03:01.590 --> 03:04.607
Basically a peekaboo
on Flintstones Vitamins.

03:04.609 --> 03:05.759
-Let's play
-Fine.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.352
But like all adults,
on my turns,

03:07.521 --> 03:10.171
I'll only hide in beds
so I can take little naps.

03:10.191 --> 03:11.932
I'll start counting.
Go upstairs.

03:12.084 --> 03:15.009
Whoa, I never even thought about
hiding upstairs.

03:15.103 --> 03:17.604
This is a game changer,
like Twitch.

03:17.756 --> 03:21.349
<i> YOUTUBER: Normal voice.</i>
<i>Playing Minecraft, quiet-normal.</i>

03:21.443 --> 03:23.184
<i> Loudest scream possible!</i>

03:23.204 --> 03:26.187
<i> Kinda quiet, normal-quiet,</i>
<i> Minecraft.</i>

03:26.281 --> 03:28.457
<i> Scorching-hot audio levels!</i>

03:38.961 --> 03:39.943
Oh, my God.

03:40.036 --> 03:43.447
Pretty cool spot, eh, Bri?

03:43.465 --> 03:45.707
Do all kids know
what a good spot

03:45.875 --> 03:47.226
a closed-door refrigerator is?

03:47.453 --> 03:50.044
No. Don't ever hide in there.
Could you even breathe?

03:50.064 --> 03:52.472
No. It's a good thing
you were looking for me.

03:52.641 --> 03:55.141
Stewie, no. Very bad.

03:55.294 --> 03:56.626
What the hell was that?

03:56.645 --> 03:58.979
A spanking.
That was me spanking you.

03:59.131 --> 04:02.299
That's it? Brian,
you either gotta be that guy

04:02.392 --> 04:03.467
or-or not be that guy.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.495
I-I don't--
I don't know what that was.

04:18.317 --> 04:20.333
Oh, God, she did it again.

04:20.486 --> 04:21.668
-Who?
-Bonnie.

04:21.820 --> 04:24.763
Every time I do a post,
she does one right after.

04:24.990 --> 04:26.448
-So what?
-So<i> what?</i>

04:26.508 --> 04:28.934
It undercuts my post's
popularity.

04:29.161 --> 04:31.603
Like<i> Armageddon</i> and<i> Deep Impact.</i>

04:31.755 --> 04:33.680
Oh, yeah, that was weird.

04:33.757 --> 04:36.275
Can you imagine you just
wrapped principle shooting

04:36.426 --> 04:38.335
on<i> Volcano,</i> and you're
very proud of it,

04:38.428 --> 04:40.520
and then bam,
here comes<i> Dante's Peak?</i>

04:40.672 --> 04:41.763
One more and I'll get it.

04:41.931 --> 04:44.508
You've just finished
a comprehensive retelling

04:44.526 --> 04:47.101
of early '70s middle-distance
running in Oregon

04:47.195 --> 04:48.345
with<i> Prefontaine,</i>

04:48.438 --> 04:50.030
and then boom,
your Leto gets Crudup'ed

04:50.124 --> 04:53.033
by<i> Without Limits.</i>

04:53.127 --> 04:55.035
Sorry, I was tracking
two ladies holding hands,

04:55.187 --> 04:57.278
and they just kissed goodbye,
so I've been elsewhere.

04:57.298 --> 05:00.999
Wha-What were you saying?
Y-You like movies or something?

05:01.226 --> 05:02.208
Ah, look at this.

05:02.361 --> 05:04.361
A glassblowing class.

05:04.454 --> 05:07.431
That kind of crap is perfect
for Instagram.

05:09.793 --> 05:11.643
(phone chimes)

05:17.133 --> 05:18.800
Oh, I'm so beat.

05:18.877 --> 05:20.468
Me and Rupert played H&S--

05:20.487 --> 05:21.878
quicker way to say
hide-and-seek--

05:21.897 --> 05:24.472
all night,
until like 8:00 p.m.

05:24.566 --> 05:26.049
I'm not even joking.
Wanna play?

05:26.142 --> 05:28.401
Not now. I'm trying to get
this TED Talk onto the TV.

05:28.554 --> 05:31.145
I can see the PornHub logo
reflecting on your

05:31.165 --> 05:33.740
big, wet dog eyes,
you scumbag.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.560
Honestly, Stewie, I'm getting
pretty bored of hide-and-seek.

05:36.578 --> 05:38.837
Oh, please, Brian,
just one game. Please?

05:39.064 --> 05:40.488
(sighs)
Okay.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.007
But no more hiding
in the fridge,

05:42.158 --> 05:44.234
in the washing machine,
the open safe

05:44.252 --> 05:46.069
with the long-forgotten
combination.

05:46.088 --> 05:47.404
Oh, no, I'm way better now.

05:47.497 --> 05:49.163
I might be the best player
in the world.

05:49.257 --> 05:52.184
Okay, I'm gonna go hide.
Count to 20.

05:58.433 --> 06:01.485
I'll probably count to, like,
six or seven minutes.

06:10.762 --> 06:13.597
Oh, baby, that's the spot.

06:13.615 --> 06:16.083

06:25.293 --> 06:26.718
Oh, Amelie, Noelle,

06:26.945 --> 06:28.553
I have a 48-hour layover
in Paris,

06:28.780 --> 06:30.780

06:30.799 --> 06:31.890

That's what I was hoping for.

06:34.878 --> 06:37.062
Oh, this is gonna be
a great weekend.

06:37.213 --> 06:38.471
That seems like
it's happening, right?

06:38.565 --> 06:40.140
Your orgy? Yeah.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.175
Can we just talk about
plane stuff?

06:42.327 --> 06:43.460
Ah, I forget you young guys

06:43.478 --> 06:45.237
don't like to talk about sex
at work.

06:45.464 --> 06:47.572
Hey, take over for a sec.
I gotta make sure I packed

06:47.724 --> 06:50.634
my pilot sunglasses that
diminish our entire profession

06:50.636 --> 06:52.994
to a frat guy's
Halloween costume.

06:56.566 --> 06:58.733
-Stewie?
-Mr. Quagmire?

06:58.752 --> 07:00.460
Terrance.

07:08.244 --> 07:09.669
All right, we're gonna
get you home, little guy.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.321
(line ringing)

07:11.490 --> 07:13.748
Peter, is Lois there?
Put me on speaker.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.842
Hi, Glenn.
What's going on?

07:15.919 --> 07:17.084
Well, I just flew to Paris,

07:17.104 --> 07:19.253
and Stewie was somehow
in my suitcase.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.605
He must have snuck in there.

07:20.832 --> 07:22.590
Oh, my God!
Is he okay?

07:22.684 --> 07:25.277
Yeah, he's eating one of those
weird French street ham things

07:25.428 --> 07:27.446
that aren't good
but are also amazing.

07:27.597 --> 07:28.763
Look, how soon can you
come get him?

07:28.782 --> 07:30.282
I only have 48 hours in Paris

07:30.433 --> 07:32.433
and a whole list of
horny activities to do.

07:32.527 --> 07:35.361
Okay, let me just
do the math.

07:35.438 --> 07:38.272
In 48 hours we'd need to
get to an airport,

07:38.366 --> 07:41.034
which we're hours from,
find a last-minute flight--

07:41.186 --> 07:42.127
if there are any--

07:42.354 --> 07:45.188
fly ten hours,
then wait for Peter's

07:45.207 --> 07:46.873
post-flight airport poop...

07:47.025 --> 07:48.282
Peter don't poop on planes.

07:48.302 --> 07:51.803
Or we leave him in the care
of a trusted adult

07:51.955 --> 07:54.288
and one of our best friends
and enjoy the first trip

07:54.457 --> 07:56.349
we've had together in years.

07:57.126 --> 07:59.035
Lois, uh, shouldn't we go?

07:59.128 --> 08:01.371
(sighs)
Okay, if you think that...

08:01.464 --> 08:03.815
-(phone chimes)
-Ah! I got another like.

08:04.042 --> 08:06.042
Peter, listen, Stewie is safe,

08:06.061 --> 08:08.378
we're in the prettiest place
we'll ever be

08:08.396 --> 08:10.213
and I'm on an Instagram
hot streak.

08:10.232 --> 08:12.232
I can beat Bonnie's record.

08:12.384 --> 08:13.566
Still, as parents,
I think that...

08:13.719 --> 08:16.069
Oh, look, my mom's friend that
kind of looks like

08:16.221 --> 08:18.905
the AT&T lady just commented
on my last post.

08:19.057 --> 08:23.001
She says, "Your husband is
very handsome."

08:23.152 --> 08:25.003
Quags, you got this, right?

08:25.154 --> 08:29.156
-Captain Quagmire, the Quags...
-Stop! I can't believe this.

08:29.251 --> 08:30.842
(sighs sharply)
Okay, I'll watch him.

08:30.994 --> 08:32.201
But I'm not happy, Peter.

08:32.203 --> 08:33.678
Oh, and now that you're
my babysitter,

08:33.830 --> 08:35.421
I'd rather you call me
Mr. Griffin.

08:35.516 --> 08:37.516
(phones chime)

08:37.667 --> 08:40.093
Peter, did you just text me
the peach emoji

08:40.187 --> 08:41.911
followed by
the water squirt emoji?

08:41.930 --> 08:44.247
Yeah. You're the babysitter now.

08:44.266 --> 08:46.608
And it's "Mr. Griffin."

I don't know
what you're yammering about,

09:16.281 --> 09:18.948
but the only place you're going
is this hotel and the airport.

09:18.967 --> 09:20.541
Kind of thought
you'd be asleep by now.

09:20.561 --> 09:23.544
I'm smart but not
"put myself to sleep" smart.

09:23.564 --> 09:26.639
I'm just gonna put on some music
for a bit to calm down.

09:26.792 --> 09:28.141

19:09.298 --> 19:10.631
Nobody would ever look here.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.707
It's too scary.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.043
It is pretty scary.

19:14.061 --> 19:16.395
Am I the best hide-and-seek
player in the world?

19:16.547 --> 19:17.804
Uh, yeah.

19:17.824 --> 19:20.658
There's the best little
travel buddy in the world!

19:21.661 --> 19:24.570
Whoa! I guess I'm really good
at lots of stuff!

19:24.664 --> 19:27.957
I'd say we should get a room,
but we already have one.

19:30.578 --> 19:31.727
Yep.

19:31.746 --> 19:32.837
Totally.

19:33.064 --> 19:36.081
I missed you,
you unrelenting douchebag.

I'm sorry
you broke your leg, Lois.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.595
Oh, no, Peter,
I'm the one who's sorry.

20:06.689 --> 20:10.433
I got so wrapped up trying to
beat Bonnie at stupid Instagram

20:10.451 --> 20:12.543
that I ruined our whole weekend.

With a broken leg?!

20:20.278 --> 20:22.127
I know. What was I thinking?

20:22.204 --> 20:24.797
And the irony is
she still has the record.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.541
I guess we should probably take
an Instagram break

20:27.560 --> 20:28.542
for a bit, huh?

20:28.636 --> 20:30.135
Probably.

20:30.288 --> 20:33.105
Can I check something
on our bank account real quick?

20:33.900 --> 20:35.641
Uh, Lois?

20:35.793 --> 20:37.235
You may want to see this.

20:40.556 --> 20:41.814
Ah! Break's over!

20:41.966 --> 20:43.241
Eat that, Bonnie!

20:43.468 --> 20:45.892
Oh, Peter, now that I have
more likes than Bonnie,

20:45.987 --> 20:49.305
I realize that this was
the best weekend ever.
