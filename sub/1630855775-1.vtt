WEBVTT

08:36.772 --> 08:39.149
For those who fast,
the weather will be pleasant.

08:39.274 --> 08:40.859
We wish all the people in Israel

08:40.984 --> 08:43.695
an easy fast
and G'Mar Chatima Tova.

08:43.820 --> 08:47.741
Our broadcasts will resume
when the fast ends.

20:28.399 --> 20:31.527
An IDF spokesperson
has informed us

20:31.653 --> 20:33.321
that Syrian forces
are attacking in the north.

20:33.446 --> 20:35.698
The Egyptians are advancing
in the Sinai Desert,

20:35.823 --> 20:38.326
in the south,
and bombing our forces.

20:38.451 --> 20:41.955
If Syria conquers
the Golan Heights,

20:42.080 --> 20:45.124
Israel will be vulnerable
to a large-scale invasion.

24:21.174 --> 24:23.050
Good evening to our listeners.

24:23.176 --> 24:26.179
A press conference will start
in a moment in Tel Aviv

24:26.304 --> 24:28.764
with Prime Minister,
Golda Meir.

24:28.890 --> 24:30.641
We will be broadcasting
live on our channel

24:30.766 --> 24:33.686
as the Prime Minister
addresses the nation.

25:54.475 --> 25:58.521
They are all around us.
They are everywhere.

25:58.646 --> 26:01.482
The entire valley
is infested with Syrian tanks.

26:01.607 --> 26:03.609
We are being smashed down here.

26:08.990 --> 26:10.825
I have lost an entire platoon.
I have to retreat.

26:10.950 --> 26:14.287
Get back in there, Lieutenant.
Do not retreat.

26:16.289 --> 26:19.875
They can't take the north.
Drive forward!

26:20.001 --> 26:22.211
We are heading into hell.
My whole team is gone.

26:22.336 --> 26:24.005
Stay calm and do as you're told!

26:24.130 --> 26:26.132
I can't hold the line anymore.
I need urgent help! Over!

26:26.257 --> 26:29.760
They're destroying our tanks
with infantry and shells.

26:32.138 --> 26:36.559
I've not seen anything like this.
It's an onslaught. Over.

26:36.684 --> 26:40.146
Point-blank range! Thousands
of tanks are in front of us!

26:40.271 --> 26:43.858
They're firing at us!
They're slaughtering us! Over!

26:43.983 --> 26:46.277
We need help...

34:15.934 --> 34:17.394
Move out. Cross the plain.

34:17.519 --> 34:20.272
Move fast. Don't make yourself
an easy target.

34:20.898 --> 34:23.776
Let's terrify them.
Destroy anything that moves.

34:23.901 --> 34:28.489
We're moving fast.
Why aren't they firing?

34:30.365 --> 34:33.285
What was that?
Was that a tank?

34:33.410 --> 34:35.871
It's not a tank.
Where is it?

34:35.996 --> 34:37.956
I can see our fortresses
on the canal.

34:38.081 --> 34:40.375
- Has anyone seen it?
- I think it's our forces.

34:40.501 --> 34:43.170
It's not ours and it's not a tank.
I can hear its whistle.

34:43.295 --> 34:45.339
- What is it?
- It's not coming from a tank.

34:45.464 --> 34:47.257
- It's an RPG.
- Where is it coming from?

34:47.382 --> 34:48.926
I can't see a thing.

34:49.051 --> 34:51.011
I've been hit. I've been hit.
My tank's been hit!

34:51.136 --> 34:52.554
It's Sagger missiles.

34:52.679 --> 34:55.265
It's an ambush.
They're covering the whole area.

34:55.390 --> 34:57.684
Insert a shell! Always
have a shell in the barrel.

34:57.810 --> 34:58.727
We're under fire.

34:58.852 --> 35:00.771
We're getting smashed.

35:04.900 --> 35:08.445
Retreat, retreat! Saggers are
being fired nonstop. Retreat.

35:13.075 --> 35:14.576
Hundreds of Saggers
have been fired.

35:14.701 --> 35:17.162
We're at the firing line!
Retreat!

35:17.287 --> 35:19.998
This is the commander.
Fire back at them!

35:20.123 --> 35:22.042
What are you waiting for?

35:22.167 --> 35:23.877
I can't fire!
The shell is stuck!

35:24.002 --> 35:25.087
The shell is stuck!

35:25.212 --> 35:28.006
This is the commander.
No one retreats.

35:28.131 --> 35:29.466
Go back to your positions

35:29.591 --> 35:32.177
and fire back at them!
Is that clear?

35:32.302 --> 35:34.471
My whole section is injured.
We don't stand a chance.

35:34.596 --> 35:37.349
It's vital we secure the line.
Don't retreat.

35:37.474 --> 35:41.103
This is an order.
I repeat, do not retreat!

35:41.436 --> 35:43.981
I want reinforcements
if it's possible. Over.

35:44.106 --> 35:46.942
This is Three.
The enemy has infiltrated...

35:50.612 --> 35:52.322
This is the commander.

35:52.447 --> 35:55.993
Hold positions and secure
the line immediately. Over.

35:56.118 --> 35:57.953
My squad commander is dead.

35:58.078 --> 36:00.914
Adar is dead.
I'm aba... I'm abandoning...

36:01.039 --> 36:02.416
Please send us help!

36:02.541 --> 36:05.043
I... I don't want to die...

36:05.460 --> 36:09.506
I want... I want to go home!
I want to go ho...

36:19.766 --> 36:21.643
The Zionists are dead.

36:21.768 --> 36:23.979
We are in full control
of the area.

49:40.942 --> 49:42.777
According to
the Geneva agreements,

49:42.902 --> 49:44.987
both sides
have to provide information

49:45.113 --> 49:46.739
about their prisoners of war.

49:46.864 --> 49:49.575
The propaganda
from the Arab countries...

49:49.701 --> 49:52.412
...reveals very little
about the number of prisoners

49:52.537 --> 49:53.996
and missing persons.

52:20.685 --> 52:22.728
This is the commander.
I see exhaust fumes.

52:22.854 --> 52:24.689
The Egyptians are on the move.
They're crossing the Sinai.

52:24.814 --> 52:28.860
Hold on. Don't open fire until
they're in a 1,000-metre range.

52:28.985 --> 52:32.321
Wait until then.
Let them get closer. All clear?

52:32.446 --> 52:34.532
This is One. They are
2,000 meters away. Over.

52:35.950 --> 52:37.201
Commander, this is Two.

52:37.326 --> 52:39.662
I've identified movement
towards me.

52:40.621 --> 52:43.624
They are exposed.
We can knock them out easily.

52:43.749 --> 52:46.544
This is the commander.
Open fire when I command.

52:46.669 --> 52:49.422
Wait for them
to be in a 1,000-meter range,

52:49.547 --> 52:50.590
then open fire.

52:50.715 --> 52:53.134
Good luck.
We're counting on you.

52:55.761 --> 52:57.889
This is Two.
They are 1,500 meters away

52:58.014 --> 52:59.599
and approaching quickly.

52:59.724 --> 53:01.809
This is Three.
1,200 meters. Over.

53:01.934 --> 53:03.853
Station One,
prepare to open fire.

53:03.978 --> 53:08.816
Three, two, one... Fire!

53:16.490 --> 53:18.743
Don't allow them
to lift their heads!

53:18.868 --> 53:21.037
Come on, get them, fire!
Without fear!

53:25.541 --> 53:27.335
Commander, this is Two.
We're destroyed four tanks.

53:27.460 --> 53:30.463
Commander, this is Four.
We're destroyed five tanks.

53:30.588 --> 53:32.632
This is the commander.
Keep going! Don't stop!

53:32.757 --> 53:34.592
Direct fire! Don't let them
get to the line!

53:35.760 --> 53:39.513
Steady fire.
Don't waste a shot.

53:39.639 --> 53:41.515
Keep firing.

53:43.601 --> 53:46.103
This is the commander.
We're taking them all out.

53:46.228 --> 53:49.690
I repeat, all of them!
Don't leave even one tank!

53:51.150 --> 53:53.444
They are fleeing.
I see some on foot.

53:53.569 --> 53:56.197
They've had enough.
They're retreating.

53:56.322 --> 53:57.573
This is the commander.

53:57.698 --> 54:01.285
Don't stop! Don't stop!
Don't let them run away!

54:01.410 --> 54:04.288
Fire everywhere, the whole area!

54:04.413 --> 54:06.666
Commander, I'm chasing them
to the canal.

54:06.791 --> 54:11.462
Stay put. Don't move forward.
I repeat, don't move forward.

56:49.286 --> 56:51.330
All units, listen up.
We're going in.

56:51.455 --> 56:54.500
Move out.

56:54.625 --> 56:56.919
And let's button up until we
know what's on the other side.

56:57.044 --> 57:00.381
Station Two,
this is the commander.

57:00.506 --> 57:03.134
We're heading in
towards the canal.

57:16.021 --> 57:18.149
Two here. Close the route.

57:19.984 --> 57:23.612
Two, start crossing
to the other side. Over.

57:23.737 --> 57:26.365
Acapulco, we did it!
We've crossed the canal.

57:26.490 --> 57:27.449
We're in Africa.

57:43.465 --> 57:47.344
Heavy fire! It's an ambush!
We are surrounded.

57:48.637 --> 57:53.475
Large arms are hitting
the whole brigade. It's a trap.

57:53.601 --> 57:58.772
We're being hit by massive fire.

57:59.690 --> 58:04.904
They're behind us.
The Egyptians are attacking.

58:05.029 --> 58:07.573
Gunner, put the shell in there.
And smash them now!

58:07.698 --> 58:10.492
I can't! It's stuck!
I can't!

58:18.125 --> 58:23.464
David, put the shell in
and fire now!

58:28.594 --> 58:32.306
I am trying!

58:32.431 --> 58:35.935
He's dead!

58:36.060 --> 58:38.187
184, what's going on?

58:38.312 --> 58:40.147
We're being killed here.
I just lost my commander.

58:40.272 --> 58:44.902
This is Two. Wait patiently.
Wait in the bunkers.

58:45.027 --> 58:46.987
They're firing at us! Killing us.

58:47.112 --> 58:48.989
This is One.

58:49.114 --> 58:51.867
Stay calm, we will get you support.

58:51.992 --> 58:55.496
We need support now!
We are surrounded by Egyptians.

58:55.621 --> 58:57.665
Reload the gun quickly!
Come on, now!

58:57.790 --> 59:00.709
I can't! It's stuck!
It won't go in!

59:00.834 --> 59:03.045
They're coming!
Reload it now!

59:03.170 --> 59:06.090
I can't! I'm trying. I'm trying!

01:12:41.988 --> 01:12:43.948
Prime Minister Golda Meir

01:12:44.074 --> 01:12:46.743
visited the soldiers
at the front this morning,

01:12:46.868 --> 01:12:49.788
while wearing her famous shoes

01:12:49.913 --> 01:12:52.957
that are nowadays known
as "Golda shoes".

01:12:53.083 --> 01:12:54.751
She immediately
opens the newspaper,

01:12:54.876 --> 01:12:57.295
reading every page.

01:12:58.171 --> 01:13:01.800
This is our Prime Minister's
first visit to Egypt.

01:13:01.925 --> 01:13:05.804
She stands up and looks out
with some excitement.

01:13:09.933 --> 01:13:11.935
We are completely confident

01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:15.105
in holding the vast desert land
we've conquered.

01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:17.649
This land creates
a complete separation

01:13:17.774 --> 01:13:20.068
between us
and the Third Army soldiers

01:13:20.193 --> 01:13:22.904
who crossed the canal,
and moved towards us.

01:13:25.824 --> 01:13:28.243
Her face shows sadness.

01:13:28.368 --> 01:13:31.704
She seems to be aware
of the heavy cost in human life

01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:33.414
caused by crossing the canal.

01:13:44.134 --> 01:13:47.137
Her first time
on the Egyptian side.

01:13:47.262 --> 01:13:48.847
She is greeted by many soldiers.

01:13:48.972 --> 01:13:51.182
- All the best to you.
- Hey.

01:13:51.307 --> 01:13:55.603
- Hey, hey.
- Wait, guys.

01:13:55.728 --> 01:13:57.939
The soldiers
on the surrounding dunes

01:13:58.064 --> 01:14:00.775
are waiting patiently
for a group photo.

01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:03.444
Mrs. Meir
is also waiting patiently,

01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:06.573
until the last photographer
can capture this special moment.

01:14:06.698 --> 01:14:10.785
The soldiers who surround her
leave her no choice.

01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:12.829
- As you move...
- Softly.

01:14:12.954 --> 01:14:16.749
We'd already encircled
the Third Army at that point,

01:14:16.875 --> 01:14:19.586
and we could've wiped them out

01:14:19.711 --> 01:14:22.297
and destroyed them.

01:14:22.422 --> 01:14:24.090
It's really crushing.

01:14:24.215 --> 01:14:26.885
The IDF was leading,
until we were ordered to stop.

01:15:11.596 --> 01:15:13.139
At the end of a tiring day,

01:15:13.264 --> 01:15:15.683
Golda bids farewell
to the soldiers...

01:15:15.808 --> 01:15:17.769
...and boards a helicopter
back to Tel-Aviv

01:15:17.894 --> 01:15:19.479
to take care
of the country's affairs.

01:19:41.991 --> 01:19:43.910
The meeting is over.

01:19:44.035 --> 01:19:46.454
Dado is leaving the tent,

01:19:46.579 --> 01:19:50.041
followed by the Egyptian
commander, General Gamasy.

01:19:50.166 --> 01:19:53.169
They are both rushing
to report to their leaders

01:19:53.294 --> 01:19:55.922
about the events
of this important day.
