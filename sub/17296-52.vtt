00:44.174 --> 00:45.610
Oh!

01:08.242 --> 01:11.027
When evil comes calling, there's only
one man who can answer the... Call.

01:11.071 --> 01:14.161
Garfield "Beast Boy" Logan
is a mysterious loner

01:14.204 --> 01:15.988
with an even more
mysterious past,

01:16.032 --> 01:18.469
and his best friend
is a talking car.

01:18.513 --> 01:20.689
And together, they solve crimes.

01:23.039 --> 01:24.649
All day and all night,

01:24.693 --> 01:27.348
driving around in the
desert really fast,

01:27.391 --> 01:30.438
solving crimes in a car
that can talk.

01:30.481 --> 01:33.484
And sometimes, they
almost get the girl.

01:33.528 --> 01:37.053
Watch out, danger.
Your days are numbered.

01:49.761 --> 01:51.807
Quiet! There might be
a crime about to happen.

01:51.850 --> 01:53.896
Dude! How many times
do I have to tell you?

01:53.939 --> 01:55.680
There's no crime in the desert.

01:55.724 --> 01:57.160
You need people to commit crime.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.162
And there's no people
in the desert!

01:59.206 --> 02:01.425
What would we do if we
even witnessed a crime?

02:01.469 --> 02:02.513
Are we deputized

02:02.557 --> 02:04.080
law enforcement agents?

02:04.124 --> 02:05.734
Are we allowed to arrest
or detain suspects?

02:05.777 --> 02:08.258
Quiet! I think
I see a bad guy.

02:10.956 --> 02:13.437
You know you don't
have to steer.

02:13.481 --> 02:17.528
You don't even have to push the pedals.
I can do all that myself.

02:17.572 --> 02:18.964
I don't even know
why you're here.

02:20.444 --> 02:24.056
♪ Some day we can be together... ♪

02:24.100 --> 02:27.277
Oops.
Never mind. It's just a cactus.

02:27.321 --> 02:28.931
Dude!
Just give it up.

02:28.974 --> 02:31.151
We're never gonna find
anything out here.

02:32.630 --> 02:34.284
Maybe we should launch
over a sweet ramp

02:34.328 --> 02:36.330
so we can get a better view of the crime.

02:36.373 --> 02:38.158
Or we could drive to the beach.

02:38.201 --> 02:39.681
I bet there's tons of crime over there.

02:39.724 --> 02:41.465
Dude, we can't
solve beach crimes.

02:41.509 --> 02:43.163
Only lifeguards can do that.

02:43.206 --> 02:45.513
Oh, yeah! Lifeguards.

02:45.556 --> 02:47.471
You mean the people with the amazing
tans running up and down the beach

02:47.515 --> 02:49.299
in slow motion all day?

02:49.343 --> 02:50.561
Yeah.

02:52.737 --> 02:54.435
Sniff you later, sucker!

02:56.959 --> 02:58.221
Stick 'em up.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.267
Crime!

03:00.310 --> 03:02.791
Come on down
to the Jump City Petting Zoo.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.227
We've got plenty of animals

03:04.271 --> 03:06.490
for you to smear your
grubby little hands on.

03:06.534 --> 03:09.189
- We've got a pig, a horse, a deer...
- Whoo! Yeah!

03:09.232 --> 03:12.235
- A bear, a beaver, a dog...
- All right! Ahhh! Whoo!

03:12.279 --> 03:13.628
- A different dog.
- Oh!

03:13.671 --> 03:15.369
Looking for something
a little more exotic?

03:15.412 --> 03:16.544
We've got a giraffe,

03:16.587 --> 03:18.459
a big old elephant, a rhino,

03:18.502 --> 03:20.461
a silly monkey
and a mean gorilla.

03:21.592 --> 03:22.854
And that's not all.

03:22.898 --> 03:24.334
- It isn't?
- Nope.

03:24.378 --> 03:26.510
We've got
a scary T. rex,

03:26.554 --> 03:29.121
a pterodactyl, a triceratops,

03:29.165 --> 03:30.340
a biceratops.

03:30.384 --> 03:31.733
Um...

03:31.776 --> 03:33.604
And don't forget about
the brontosaurus.

03:35.650 --> 03:38.522
I bet you think we don't have a
snake with the head of a chicken.

03:38.566 --> 03:40.176
- A what?
- Well, you're wrong!

03:40.220 --> 03:42.439
We've totally got a snake
with the head of a chicken.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.441
We've got all kinds

03:44.485 --> 03:47.618
of adorable abominations for you to
touch with your fleshy meat fingers.

03:47.662 --> 03:50.142
Like... A tiger with
a dolphin body.

03:51.492 --> 03:52.884
You name it,
we've got it. Literally.

03:52.928 --> 03:55.235
Just call it out and watch
the magic happen.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.542
Llama with a crocodile neck.

03:58.586 --> 03:59.891
And a cow for a butt.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.677
That's the Jump City Petting Zoo

04:02.720 --> 04:04.244
located on Teen Titans Island.

04:04.287 --> 04:05.810
Just drive to the coast
and swim across the bay

04:05.854 --> 04:06.985
towards the giant
T-shaped building.

04:07.029 --> 04:08.552
Come on and pet all the animals.

04:08.596 --> 04:10.250
You probably won't regret it.

05:19.580 --> 05:20.972
Hey, Robin.

05:21.016 --> 05:23.584
What do you call a pirate
with a blue top hat?

05:25.586 --> 05:27.501
I don't know, Starfire.
What do you call it?

05:27.544 --> 05:29.198
I do not know the either.

05:29.241 --> 05:31.896
The education system
has failed me.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.378
Society is crumbling.

06:28.170 --> 06:31.303
The herd of wild burritos
have settled in the kitchen.

06:31.347 --> 06:33.784
Little do they know,
a ferocious predator

06:33.828 --> 06:35.438
lurks in the shadows.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.092
He begins his approach.

06:37.135 --> 06:39.050
A lame burrito
has fallen behind.

06:39.094 --> 06:42.184
With a top speed of
approximately zero miles per hour,

06:42.227 --> 06:44.360
it has no chance of escape.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.406
The Beast Boy lunges for his prey...

06:46.449 --> 06:49.278
...only to be blocked by the dastardly Cyborg.

06:49.321 --> 06:52.368
Luckily, the Cyborg prefers burgers.

06:52.412 --> 06:55.240
The burrito lives
to fight another day.

06:55.284 --> 06:57.460
Meanwhile, in a completely different room,

06:57.504 --> 07:00.985
the lonely Robin attempts
to woo the lovely Starfire.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.857
To initiate his elaborate courtship,

07:02.900 --> 07:04.336
the Robin puffs out his chest

07:04.380 --> 07:06.164
and slicks back his hair

07:06.208 --> 07:07.731
and begins to dance.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.170
The flashy display
is completely ignored.

07:12.214 --> 07:13.476
He'll need to up his game

07:13.520 --> 07:15.478
in order to win her affection.

07:16.914 --> 07:19.090
The Robin bellows out
his native song

07:19.134 --> 07:20.962
while jumping wildly
around the room.

07:22.311 --> 07:24.139
She couldn't care less.

07:24.182 --> 07:27.272
What a truly desperate
and pathetic creature.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.013
As day gives way to night,

07:29.057 --> 07:32.930
a mysterious figure emerges
in the Teen Titans Tower.

07:32.974 --> 07:35.324
A vicious and elusive Raven.

07:36.107 --> 07:37.935
There she is.

07:37.979 --> 07:40.285
Conducting one of her
demonic rituals, most likely.

07:40.329 --> 07:42.940
Wait. No. She's playing with ponies.

07:44.246 --> 07:45.595
Oh, no.
She spotted me!

07:56.650 --> 07:58.303
Hey there, smooth face.

07:58.347 --> 08:00.305
Are you sick of always feeling left out?

08:00.349 --> 08:02.003
Getting picked last for dodgeball?

08:02.046 --> 08:03.352
Nobody returning your texts?

08:03.395 --> 08:05.049
Your dog forgot your name?

08:05.093 --> 08:06.790
Why don't you turn your life around

08:06.834 --> 08:08.836
