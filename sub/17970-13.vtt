WEBVTT

00:08.008 --> 00:09.717
You shot me.

00:09.885 --> 00:11.302
Well, you were gonna shoot me.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.811
All right, stay with me, Alan, okay?

00:22.564 --> 00:24.565
Stay with me, Alan, all right?

00:29.446 --> 00:31.114
You have a son now.
Think about that.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.659
You're gonna pull through this.
Think about that.

00:43.836 --> 00:47.296
-No sign of that lunatic Peter.
-Thinking he's crazy is your first mistake.

00:47.464 --> 00:49.173
What do you call
firing at the Navy?

00:49.341 --> 00:51.342
Aggressive. They'll think twice
about evac.

00:51.510 --> 00:54.679
Gotta keep trying. There's no telling
how far the Mycosis has spread.

00:54.847 --> 00:57.557
Mayday, Mayday.
This is Dr. Kyle Sommer with the CDC.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.476
We have the cure for Mycosis.
I repeat, we have the cure.

01:00.644 --> 01:03.146
We need to be smart,
find another way off this island.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.732
The longer we wait,
the higher the rate of infection.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.067
If one of those ships
gets to the mainland....

01:08.235 --> 01:10.486
We need as much of the cure
as you can carry.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.238
-Can you handle that?
-Absolutely.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.115
Where are you going?

01:14.283 --> 01:16.451
To make a deal with the devil.

01:26.462 --> 01:30.339
What have you done?!

01:30.841 --> 01:33.342
Save Amy.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.386
For what?!

01:35.804 --> 01:37.930
To look like this?

01:40.851 --> 01:43.019
Look at the two of us.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.647
What a pair we make.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.901
We're absolutely hideous.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.569
Beautiful.

01:51.737 --> 01:54.197
I'm not beautiful anymore.

01:55.032 --> 01:58.075
You know what I am, Landry?

01:59.244 --> 02:00.870
Free.

02:03.332 --> 02:10.254
Free to do whatever I want
to whoever I want.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.301
And right now...

02:16.720 --> 02:21.849
...I'd like to thank my immortal sisters...

02:22.017 --> 02:27.188
...for my new face.

02:45.165 --> 02:50.711
Two parts cannabis indica,
one part capsaicin.

02:50.879 --> 02:54.674
When it came to pain management,
my mother was a genius.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.928
Someone has desecrated
the counsel hall.

03:04.977 --> 03:08.062
-One of the others saw Jerome--
-Thank you, Carson.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.653
I thought it was a fool's errand...

03:15.821 --> 03:19.282
...but an outsider found what's
been beneath our feet for centuries.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.659
-The Mother Tree?
-What remains of her anyway.

03:22.494 --> 03:26.080
Eli, her roots may still be viable.

03:28.292 --> 03:29.625
How does that help us?

03:30.669 --> 03:33.087
Dr. Walker said Ilaria wants Mother.

03:33.255 --> 03:36.215
Why shouldn't you be the one
to deliver it?

03:36.758 --> 03:38.217
Yes.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.177
We can bypass the Navy
and the CDC.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.221
I'm sure they'll pay handsomely.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.557
It's not just about money.

03:46.518 --> 03:49.020
Ilaria has power and influence.

03:50.314 --> 03:54.650
Anne, you and I are going to be
heard around the world.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.111
Those 200 followers?

03:57.279 --> 03:58.821
Imagine 2 million.

03:59.323 --> 04:01.782
I would follow you anywhere.

04:11.960 --> 04:15.087
I need to get underneath the tree
and access the roots.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.383
There are a number of blocked-off
stairways behind the counsel hall.

04:19.551 --> 04:23.220
-We were told they were dead ends.
-Another one of Michael's lies.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.389
For us, I'll always find a way.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.360
Hey, buddy, why don't you
rest for a bit?

04:37.527 --> 04:38.819
If I gave this much blood...

04:38.987 --> 04:42.531
-...you'd have to scrape me off the floor.
-I'm fine.

04:45.744 --> 04:50.831
When we get back, the first thing I'm
gonna do is order a pizza from Fellini's.

04:50.999 --> 04:54.001
Thin crust, sausage and mushroom.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.962
Two pizzas. One for each of us.

04:56.630 --> 05:01.342
Then glorious sleep for a week straight.

05:01.510 --> 05:05.054
-That's a long time.
-We'll take breaks, of course.

05:05.222 --> 05:08.182
-Gotta make time for PlayStation.
-What's that?

05:09.393 --> 05:12.144
You mean you've never played
"Call of Duty 4"?

05:12.312 --> 05:15.272
Oh, man, you are in for a treat.

05:25.575 --> 05:26.951
Hey.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.829
I know we were real close
to getting out of here.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.123
I'm disappointed too.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.333
But nothing will stop us
from going home.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.378
Us maybe, but not my mom.

05:37.546 --> 05:40.840
I know, Soren.
I wish things were different.

05:41.008 --> 05:44.719
It's not fair. Peter killed my mom.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.429
Someone should kill him too.

05:46.596 --> 05:49.890
Whoa, hold on now.
It may not be perfect or fair...

05:50.058 --> 05:52.810
...but there's a system in place
to punish people like Peter.

05:52.978 --> 05:57.231
And I promise you,
I'll do whatever I have to.

05:57.399 --> 06:01.902
Peter is never gonna hurt you
or anybody else again.

06:03.613 --> 06:04.822
Now what?

06:12.497 --> 06:14.331
Let me find a flashlight.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.757
Soren, come back here. Soren.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.407
-How long have I been here?
-Five days.

06:49.409 --> 06:53.162
It's strange how the tables have turned.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.289
How's that?

06:55.457 --> 06:58.209
I was here 30 years ago...

07:00.629 --> 07:04.298
...but I wasn't the one in this bed.

07:06.343 --> 07:10.012
-It was Alan.
-What happened?

07:11.765 --> 07:13.599
I shot him.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.937
That doesn't make any sense.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.899
Love rarely does.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.905
I haven't completely been honest.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.910
Thirty years ago, I was here too.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.389
You killed my mom!

08:01.731 --> 08:04.900
Soren, you really shouldn't
have done that.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.406
What do you mean,
you were here 30 years ago?

08:11.241 --> 08:12.283
Who are you?

08:13.702 --> 08:16.287
At least tell me why
you stole my father's sword.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.715
You know what it means, don't you?

08:31.428 --> 08:33.304
I can read it.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.932
It's string of letters, dozens of them.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.935
"C-A-C...

08:40.103 --> 08:41.645
...G-U-C...

08:41.813 --> 08:42.813
...A-C-A--"

08:42.981 --> 08:46.650
That's an RNA code.
Each letter stands for a nucleotide.

08:46.818 --> 08:50.988
-It's a recipe for a virus.
-Like TXM-7.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.953
But he said it was his legacy.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.916
Why would my father create a virus
to kill immortals?

09:02.083 --> 09:04.335
All he ever wanted to do
was spread immortality.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.253
Maybe someone changed his mind.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.631
Goddamn it, Caleb, I'm dying.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.342
I don't have time for games.
Just tell me.

09:11.509 --> 09:14.011
I want to tell you everything.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.097
But first you have to answer
one question.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.312
Do you know the way to San Jose?

09:23.480 --> 09:24.772
What--?

09:41.081 --> 09:42.665
Carson?

09:50.173 --> 09:51.590
Hello, Mother.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.343
What?

09:54.511 --> 09:55.928
Is something the matter?

09:56.972 --> 09:59.181
Amy, your face.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.977
-You're hurt.
-Since when do you care how I feel?

10:03.645 --> 10:05.813
Of course I care.

10:05.981 --> 10:07.147
You're my daughter.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.149
Oh, really?

10:13.738 --> 10:19.410
You didn't seem to care that much when I
begged you not to let my father have me.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.873
I couldn't admit
I was wrong about Michael...

10:25.542 --> 10:29.962
...because that would mean
my entire life was a lie.

10:32.299 --> 10:37.761
I told myself laying with him
was a privilege.

10:39.014 --> 10:41.140
But it was no honor.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.269
It was abuse...

10:46.521 --> 10:49.023
...so deeply rooted...

10:49.190 --> 10:52.609
...that I accepted it
like the air we breathe.

10:56.323 --> 11:02.202
-I am so sorry, Amy.
-No, no, no.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.539
You don't get to do this.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.042
Not now.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.419
It's too late.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.882
Look at me.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.720
Look at me.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.058
Look at me.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.233
There's still hope for us.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.819
Oh, no, Mother.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.988
There's no hope.

11:38.907 --> 11:43.577
And no amount of distance
will allow us to escape what we are.

11:45.413 --> 11:49.375
You may not look like us...

11:49.542 --> 11:51.710
...but inside...

11:52.921 --> 11:55.839
...you're a monster...

11:56.007 --> 11:58.092
...a freak...

11:58.927 --> 12:00.886
...just like me.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.806
Please give me another chance.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.683
You don't deserve another chance.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.521
And I won't allow you one.

12:15.693 --> 12:16.777
The baby.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.156
No.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.700
Give me the baby.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.369
No.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.621
-I won't let you make him like me.
-No!

12:29.666 --> 12:35.379
If you follow us, I'll make sure
it never cries again.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.763
Goodbye, Mother.

12:56.067 --> 12:58.777
Conjunctive symbiosis.

13:00.071 --> 13:05.159
The union of two species
in a single body.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.244
That's Mother.

13:09.539 --> 13:12.833
The root is the host...

13:13.001 --> 13:15.335
...but the fungus causes the infertility.

13:15.503 --> 13:19.465
Luckily she's also disjunctive.
She doesn't need the root for survival.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.717
She can survive
in any genetic environment.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.094
You should really stop talking.

13:24.762 --> 13:27.389
I barely had enough thread
to suture the wound.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.183
-Jules--
-I said no talking.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.851
You can't give Mother to Ilaria.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.353
-We can control it.
-Like Michael?

13:34.355 --> 13:37.816
The Mycosis spread through bees.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.027
Even Ilaria can't control nature.

13:40.195 --> 13:42.112
Can't you see
that I don't have a choice?

13:42.739 --> 13:43.780
You do.

13:44.449 --> 13:45.908
You do. You have a choice.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.409
You know what I have?

13:47.577 --> 13:50.746
I have less than 12 hours
to stop the release of Narvik.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.459
What happened now?

13:55.627 --> 13:57.002
She shot me.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.795
And he's still talking.

13:58.963 --> 14:02.216
I don't want to get in the middle of this.
Can I have a minute?

14:10.391 --> 14:12.643
You need to get back to Paris
as soon as you can.

14:12.810 --> 14:16.939
-I wanna know if that job offer still stands.
-Yeah. Yeah, of course it does.

14:17.106 --> 14:20.234
I need to get my son off this island
along with the rest of my team.

14:20.652 --> 14:22.277
Okay, done.

14:22.445 --> 14:26.323
Look, joining us at Ilaria is in the best
interest for you and the baby, okay?

14:29.118 --> 14:30.536
Where did Alan go?

14:31.621 --> 14:33.622
I don't know, but he has Mother.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.671
This will do nicely.

14:42.590 --> 14:43.590
Give it to me.

14:43.758 --> 14:47.761
He's my friend.

14:47.929 --> 14:49.680
Friend?

14:50.890 --> 14:54.142
You--? You think it likes you?

14:54.310 --> 14:56.853
Let me show you how much.

15:05.113 --> 15:09.575
Cry really loud
so all the sisters can hear you.

15:09.742 --> 15:10.951
Good baby.

15:14.038 --> 15:17.332
You have no friends.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.553
Julia.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.639
Alan was here.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.099
We're running out of time.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.059
-If we don't find him soon--
-We will.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.061
Well, what if we don't?

15:38.229 --> 15:41.023
He has Mother. He has my sat-phone.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.859
-I should've just let him bleed out.
-Maybe you should've.

15:44.027 --> 15:46.528
It sounds callous,
but he put himself in this position.

15:46.696 --> 15:49.281
-Let's just focus on finding him.
-And then what?

15:49.449 --> 15:51.825
Are you prepared to kill him?
Because he won't stop.

15:51.993 --> 15:55.287
His hatred for immortals,
he's obsessed.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.332
-Can't help you and I being what we are.
-It's not our fault.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.627
For the past year, I've been
jumping into every hot zone I can find.

16:01.794 --> 16:05.297
-You've probably done a lot of good.
-Wish it was that, but the truth is...

16:05.465 --> 16:08.884
...if I stop to think about
what all this means, I'd lose my mind.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.137
-Did you hear that?
-Yup.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.362
Oh, my God.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.409
Who would leave a baby like this?

16:34.952 --> 16:36.703
I don't know.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.085
Let's just take it and go.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.184
Sarah, they want the baby.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.650
No, no, no. Be careful with that.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.615
No, don't, don't. Don't shoot.

17:13.783 --> 17:16.410
-Don't shoot.
-Alan could be bleeding to death.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.453
-We don't have time for this.
-Trust me.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.873
Please, please.

17:23.418 --> 17:25.377
Please, he's my son.

17:27.213 --> 17:30.006
Amy ripped my baby out of me.

17:30.174 --> 17:33.385
And I'm guessing that she was
responsible for what happened to you.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.058
But please don't hurt him
because of what she did.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.005
Thank you.

18:13.134 --> 18:16.595
Soren? Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.722
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

18:18.890 --> 18:21.975
What were you thinking?
You had me worried sick.

18:22.143 --> 18:23.393
I'm sorry.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.312
I was just following my path.

18:26.522 --> 18:30.233
Well, from now on, I need to know
where your path goes at all times.

18:33.488 --> 18:38.450
Look, this is kind of new for both of us,
so we gotta figure it out together.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.703
It's just, no one ever cared
where I went before.

18:43.831 --> 18:47.709
-All right, let's get back to work.
-Okay.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.034
Drop the can.

19:37.969 --> 19:40.053
You even know
how to operate that thing?

19:40.221 --> 19:42.264
I don't need to.

19:54.652 --> 19:56.152
Is that all you got?

19:57.947 --> 19:58.947
Two weeks ago...

19:59.115 --> 20:02.242
...I would've had a completely different
answer to that question.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.498
You know, I should be thanking you.

20:09.625 --> 20:14.212
When you left me down there
in that hole, I thought it was the end.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.759
But it was just the beginning.

20:22.680 --> 20:27.559
See, that's the thing
about hitting rock bottom.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.729
It gives you a lot of time
to reassess what's really important.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.523
Not so fast.

20:35.526 --> 20:39.696
You know, I used to think that I....

20:39.906 --> 20:42.532
I didn't deserve to be happy.

20:43.367 --> 20:50.040
That I'd never really find love,
get married, have children.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.960
But I've learned...

20:54.462 --> 20:56.838
...that family is not
what you're born with...

20:57.715 --> 20:59.716
...it's what you choose.

21:00.635 --> 21:05.347
Family stands by you no matter what.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.934
Unconditionally.

21:21.155 --> 21:22.989
That is why...

21:24.283 --> 21:26.242
...I know, Alan...

21:27.453 --> 21:28.787
...that you...

21:35.503 --> 21:37.879
...are not my family.

22:09.203 --> 22:11.121
-You really mean it?
-Sure do.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.874
-Whoever makes the cure gets to name it.
-But didn't Alan make it?

22:15.084 --> 22:17.544
I'm sure he wouldn't mind
if we named it after you.

22:17.712 --> 22:19.421
How about...

22:19.630 --> 22:21.506
...Sorenol?

22:21.716 --> 22:23.675
How about...

22:24.593 --> 22:25.802
...Olivia?

22:27.346 --> 22:29.264
I think that's a great idea.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.438
Smell that?

22:37.815 --> 22:39.107
Yeah.

22:39.316 --> 22:41.192
It smells like smoke.

22:52.246 --> 22:54.581
St. Germain,
this is the USS Independence.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.958
We have a visual.
Fire on ground, do you copy?

22:57.168 --> 23:00.420
Heck, yeah, we copy.
Standing by with the cure.

23:00.629 --> 23:03.006
Be advised,
we're sending in another chopper.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.175
Evac at 0400. Over.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.718
We gotta go find Dr. Jordan.

23:07.261 --> 23:09.554
And I'm not letting you
out of my sight. Come on.

23:09.764 --> 23:13.016
-We need to get out of here.
-Not until I get my bag back and Mother.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.977
How are you gonna do that?
You have no idea where Alan is.

23:17.021 --> 23:18.938
I do now.

23:19.273 --> 23:22.358
Who do you think started that fire?
He's trying to destroy Mother.

23:22.568 --> 23:23.651
Come on.

23:23.861 --> 23:25.779
-No, Julia. I can't.
-What?

23:25.988 --> 23:28.073
I have to get my child to safety.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.494
Okay. I'll meet you outside.

23:38.501 --> 23:41.252
Dr. Walker?

23:41.962 --> 23:44.714
Dr. Jordan?

23:46.509 --> 23:50.011
I can't wait to see...

23:50.221 --> 23:52.514
...what the ladies have done to you.

24:06.529 --> 24:08.154
What are you doing?

24:08.364 --> 24:11.241
Let go! Let go! Let go of me!

24:11.450 --> 24:14.077
Let go. Let go!

24:14.286 --> 24:15.453
Let go!

24:18.124 --> 24:20.959
Landry!

24:21.127 --> 24:23.795
Landry!

24:24.004 --> 24:27.382
Landry!

24:27.675 --> 24:28.842
Help me.

24:29.051 --> 24:30.677
Please.

24:31.262 --> 24:34.681
Landry. Please.

24:34.849 --> 24:37.267
Help me. Help, help, help.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.102
Come on. Landry!

24:39.311 --> 24:41.771
Landry! No! No! No!

24:46.277 --> 24:47.610
Let go!

24:48.154 --> 24:50.446
No! No.

24:56.412 --> 24:57.829
No!

25:04.628 --> 25:05.670
Alan?

25:07.464 --> 25:08.840
Alan?

25:09.592 --> 25:11.217
Alan?

25:12.386 --> 25:14.470
Alan?

25:16.932 --> 25:19.100
Alan?

25:22.479 --> 25:23.813
Jules.

25:27.818 --> 25:28.985
Alan.

25:30.738 --> 25:31.905
Alan.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.407
Where's my bag? Where's Mother?

25:34.617 --> 25:36.367
Peter....

25:38.329 --> 25:40.121
Okay, come on.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.457
Come on. Come on.

25:42.666 --> 25:43.666
Let's go.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.338
I'm going back for our baby.

25:48.547 --> 25:49.923
No, Eli.

25:50.132 --> 25:51.799
It's too late.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.763
I'm his father. I have to try.

25:57.223 --> 26:00.308
Please, don't do this.

26:00.768 --> 26:02.352
I can't lose both of you.

26:07.191 --> 26:09.692
I told you, I'll find a way.

26:23.666 --> 26:26.793
Sarah? Sarah?

26:29.129 --> 26:31.214
You ought to keep
that kid on a tighter leash.

26:32.174 --> 26:33.841
That little shit stabbed me.

26:34.051 --> 26:36.094
Someone needs to
teach him some manners.

26:37.972 --> 26:40.765
Is that true? Did you stab him?

26:43.018 --> 26:45.186
Well, don't ever do that again.

26:50.234 --> 26:51.484
Don't ever do that either.

26:54.363 --> 26:55.780
About time someone did that.

26:56.657 --> 26:58.074
Let's go.

27:16.802 --> 27:19.345
Landry, stop. Where are you going?

27:22.057 --> 27:23.808
Home.

27:44.288 --> 27:45.955
Come on, Julia, where are you?

27:51.337 --> 27:55.006
Before I show you something,
do you know the way to San Jose?

28:09.229 --> 28:11.439
Yes, I do.

28:16.487 --> 28:20.990
We were running late on our way
up north to where Alan's family was.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.494
We blew a tire on the 101.

28:25.871 --> 28:28.456
The car swerved across
four lanes of traffic.

28:30.334 --> 28:33.461
We got a tow to
a repair shop in San Jose.

28:35.589 --> 28:37.298
City hall was just down the street.

28:37.508 --> 28:40.301
And in the time it took to patch a tire...

28:40.511 --> 28:42.470
...we got married.

28:47.101 --> 28:49.352
And I'll never forget what he said.

28:52.648 --> 28:55.400
You love is gonna kill me.

29:05.577 --> 29:08.496
I do know the way to San Jose.

29:14.962 --> 29:16.295
Who are you?

29:58.422 --> 29:59.464
Soren?

30:02.843 --> 30:05.803
I haven't heard that name
for a long time.

30:56.730 --> 30:58.856
Dr. Sommer,
you have something for us?

30:59.441 --> 31:01.400
Seventeen vials of Mycosis cure.

31:01.610 --> 31:04.570
We won't have time to run this
through normal testing protocols.

31:04.780 --> 31:08.407
-You don't have to. This is the real deal.
-Can you stake your life on it?

31:08.575 --> 31:09.992
I already have.

31:10.619 --> 31:14.747
If he's telling the truth, we are gonna
save thousands of lives with this cure.

31:14.957 --> 31:16.207
It's called Olivia.

31:17.167 --> 31:18.376
Okay.

31:18.585 --> 31:20.127
We'll take good care of Olivia.

31:25.634 --> 31:27.927
Peter, you opportunistic prick.

31:28.679 --> 31:30.429
I know you have Mother.
Where is she?

31:30.597 --> 31:33.516
Why, right here, Julia.

31:37.980 --> 31:39.689
Claire.

31:40.941 --> 31:42.525
What are you doing here?

31:43.277 --> 31:46.696
When we got word of a rescue
from St. Germain, we came quickly.

31:47.322 --> 31:48.364
But I didn't call you.

31:49.157 --> 31:51.325
That doesn't mean
we weren't listening.

31:53.579 --> 31:56.038
Dr. Farragut has shared
how instrumental you were...

31:56.206 --> 31:57.790
...in securing the Mother fungus.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.167
How very thoughtful of him.

32:00.377 --> 32:02.837
We'll have to make sure
he's properly compensated.

32:03.046 --> 32:04.589
No need.

32:04.798 --> 32:08.426
Madame Wallenberg has been
more than generous.

32:11.638 --> 32:13.389
What about Narvik-C?

32:13.599 --> 32:18.352
Narvik-C? Please tell me
you haven't discovered a new strain.

32:19.688 --> 32:21.981
But you and the board
told me about it.

32:22.149 --> 32:24.650
I don't seem to recall that.

32:27.904 --> 32:31.073
Nor do I think will anyone at Ilaria.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.203
Wow, Dr. Kyle.

32:37.164 --> 32:39.040
Have you ever seen so many lights?

32:40.417 --> 32:41.751
Dr. Sommer.

32:44.087 --> 32:46.464
-You've brought in Dr. Farragut?
-Yes, ma'am.

32:47.090 --> 32:50.217
-I have your man.
-Do we have enough to make an arrest?

33:01.563 --> 33:02.980
First Bank of Atlanta.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.608
Safety deposit box number 274.

34:57.637 --> 35:00.181
It was Alan, wasn't it?

35:02.726 --> 35:06.228
Why else would my wedding story
be the answer to your question?

35:09.274 --> 35:11.817
It was Alan and your father.

35:13.111 --> 35:16.447
-They created TXM-7.
-They were always at odds.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.659
They found common ground...

35:21.036 --> 35:25.080
...after Ilaria used the fungus
to gain control of human procreation.

35:25.290 --> 35:27.666
They engineered a virus
to kill immortals.

35:32.172 --> 35:34.215
But they also came up with a cure.

35:43.892 --> 35:45.434
You?

35:49.356 --> 35:50.606
You're the cure?

35:50.816 --> 35:53.734
Alan said my blood was special.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.070
That's why he hid me on this island.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.364
And I'm gonna stay here until--

35:58.573 --> 36:00.783
Until TXM-7...

36:00.992 --> 36:04.537
...wipes out the entire
immortal population.

36:14.214 --> 36:15.923
Take it.

36:28.103 --> 36:30.980
-Maybe I don't deserve it.
-You came here looking for a cure.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.774
I came here looking for time.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.196
That's the thing.
The more you have, the more you want.

36:41.575 --> 36:42.992
I can save your life.

36:43.201 --> 36:46.245
If the plague is immortality...

36:48.081 --> 36:49.832
...then there's only one cure.

37:03.930 --> 37:05.764
I wish you'd change your mind.

37:07.267 --> 37:10.686
And I wish I could see Alan
one more time.

37:43.887 --> 37:45.304
Jules?

37:45.513 --> 37:47.181
Sarah?

38:33.645 --> 38:35.479
Where does my food come from?

38:35.689 --> 38:37.940
Is it safe to eat? Is it natural?

38:39.401 --> 38:41.318
Ilaria Fresh means
no harmful pesticides.

38:41.528 --> 38:46.281
Each seed is specifically designed
with you and your family in mind.

38:46.491 --> 38:47.992
When you shop Ilaria Fresh...

38:48.201 --> 38:51.620
...you're pledging your commitment
to the stewardship of the future.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.122
Their future.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.624
So come, join us at the dinner table.

38:55.834 --> 38:59.545
Together, we can brave the new world
of sustainable resources.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.922
From our family to yours.

39:02.132 --> 39:03.841
Ilaria Fresh.

39:04.634 --> 39:05.884
Nicole Wilson?

39:06.094 --> 39:07.261
Ilaria.

39:07.846 --> 39:08.929
Living life.

39:09.139 --> 39:11.140
Living longer.

39:44.966 --> 39:46.800
How many women
do you normally see?

39:47.260 --> 39:49.720
These days? Most of them.

39:51.556 --> 39:53.974
It's just, I have everything else.

39:54.184 --> 39:57.519
My great job, a wonderful husband...

39:57.729 --> 39:59.772
...but it feels like one thing is missing.

40:02.150 --> 40:03.817
A child, I mean.

40:04.027 --> 40:06.737
I want to start my own family.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.455
I saw a little girl the other day...

40:16.664 --> 40:19.708
...about 3 or maybe 4 years old.

40:19.918 --> 40:22.211
I thought I was dreaming.

40:27.675 --> 40:31.929
I've heard that your program has
a 98 percent success rate with live births.

40:32.138 --> 40:33.639
It's a nine-month commitment.

40:33.848 --> 40:36.809
Very rigorous. You need to be
aware of the restrictions.

40:37.018 --> 40:38.560
Of course.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.646
I'll do anything.

40:41.648 --> 40:44.817
Go ahead and get dressed.
The doctor will see you now.

41:32.031 --> 41:33.657
Welcome.

41:33.867 --> 41:35.826
I'm Dr. Jordan.
