a perfectly suitable match,

she refuses to pick a date

fix a date

choice of husband,

15:12.727 --> 15:14.062
to concentrate her mind.

15:16.968 --> 15:18.071
Miss Havisham,

15:18.071 --> 15:20.642
are you saying that I,
Herbert Pocket,

15:21.644 --> 15:23.214
might be second choice?

15:23.214 --> 15:25.085
Indeed you are, Mr. Pocket.
Indeed you are,

15:25.085 --> 15:27.088
(EXCLAIMING) Estella...

15:28.190 --> 15:29.794
I had no idea.

15:29.794 --> 15:30.963
Neither did I, Herbert.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.604
Mama, I do not wish
to play this game anymore.

15:34.905 --> 15:36.875
And you're not being
very fair on Herbert.

15:36.875 --> 15:38.845
Second place wins
on an each-way bet.

15:39.313 --> 15:40.515
Herbert has no complaints.

15:41.116 --> 15:43.087
If you no longer wish
to play this game, Estella,

15:43.087 --> 15:44.456
you simply have
to give me a date

15:44.456 --> 15:45.859
to give to husband number one.

15:46.226 --> 15:48.498
I am tired
of sending him excuses.

15:52.973 --> 15:53.975
No?

15:54.409 --> 15:57.015
Very well. We shall continue.
Mr. Pocket...

15:57.449 --> 15:59.520
Let us find out
how well you dance.

16:05.833 --> 16:06.834
JAGGERS: Drummle.

16:08.137 --> 16:10.474
I would say
you need new furniture.

16:11.076 --> 16:13.982
I hear this new bride of yours
has very expensive taste.

16:14.283 --> 16:16.521
She likes ivory, and gold.

16:16.521 --> 16:17.823
PIP: She hates ivory.

16:18.157 --> 16:19.660
Because she likes elephants.

16:20.929 --> 16:22.031
What did he say?

16:22.533 --> 16:25.271
Pip said he hates ivory
because he loves elephants.

16:25.271 --> 16:28.177
No, no, I heard distinctly.
He said,

16:28.612 --> 16:31.149
"She hates ivory."

16:31.350 --> 16:34.790
How does the boy know
what she hates?

16:40.903 --> 16:42.139
When she and you met,

16:42.139 --> 16:43.775
it was quite obvious
what she hated.

16:50.689 --> 16:52.760
DRUMMLE: <i>By God, once she is
hooked on my line,</i>

16:52.760 --> 16:54.797

to like what I like.</i>

16:56.634 --> 16:57.836
<i>By God, she will.</i>

17:03.347 --> 17:08.157
I will fashion her into a form
not dissimilar to my own mother.

17:15.004 --> 17:17.275
Oh, bless me. Is it two years?

17:18.177 --> 17:19.814
Is what two years, Drummle?

17:21.350 --> 17:23.755
Since my dear mother was taken.

17:31.771 --> 17:33.541
(SOBBING)

17:39.019 --> 17:40.321
There, you see?

17:40.990 --> 17:43.996
The brandy
has washed away the man,

17:43.996 --> 17:46.634
and left behind
the orphan child.

17:47.135 --> 17:48.538
Now we make our move.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.115
Drummle, I forgot
to mention earlier.

17:54.115 --> 17:56.053
There are some articles
which you need to sign...

17:56.053 --> 17:57.723
Has it really been two years?

17:57.723 --> 17:59.593
Drummle, we need
your signature.

18:01.029 --> 18:03.301
DRUMMLE: I don't do business
after 6:00.

18:03.301 --> 18:05.004
Dorget sets sail in the morning,

18:05.004 --> 18:07.944
I will take Estella
to Connemara

18:07.944 --> 18:09.213
to visit the grave.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.016
Drummle, just fucking sign...

18:12.953 --> 18:15.024
- Drummle...
- Hmm?

18:15.024 --> 18:16.728
After you sign,

18:16.728 --> 18:19.600
you can drink a toast
to your wonderful mother.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.242
Yeah.

18:36.701 --> 18:38.070
Now the toast, yes?

18:41.243 --> 18:42.646
To my mother.

18:44.216 --> 18:45.217
Who I love.

very well, Mama.

19:44.670 --> 19:49.012
And after all, he does know
that Portugal is next to Spain.

19:49.480 --> 19:51.050
Let us proceed
with the second choice,

How society will rejoice, Mama,

20:01.069 --> 20:04.042
Estella! Estella!

20:08.317 --> 20:10.120
How do you know Compeyson
and Magwitch?

20:10.956 --> 20:12.124
You first.

20:15.131 --> 20:18.103
I was a boy.
They escaped from a hulk.

20:18.605 --> 20:19.974
I helped Magwitch.

20:19.974 --> 20:21.744
I saw them almost
murder each other.

20:23.915 --> 20:25.451
Compeyson and Magwitch

20:25.451 --> 20:27.990
will still be fighting each
other 1,000 years from now.

20:28.324 --> 20:31.296
In hell, with the devil
trying to keep them apart.

20:32.365 --> 20:35.004
Why? Why do they
hate each other?

20:35.205 --> 20:38.177
Money and women.

20:38.177 --> 20:39.713
What money?

20:40.114 --> 20:41.316
Which women?

20:47.261 --> 20:50.201
The women were many
and various.

20:50.201 --> 20:51.436
Compeyson, in particular,

20:51.436 --> 20:55.277
was considered by the fair sex
to be practically irresistible.

20:59.486 --> 21:01.357
Did Compeyson and Magwitch
used to be friends?

21:01.357 --> 21:02.425
JAGGERS: You know, Pip,

21:02.425 --> 21:05.999
sometimes the marsh fog
comes out in your diction.

21:07.035 --> 21:08.905
Frame the question thus...

21:08.905 --> 21:12.479
"Were Compeyson and Magwitch
once friends?"

21:12.479 --> 21:13.915
Well?

21:13.915 --> 21:15.250
They were swindlers.

21:16.420 --> 21:17.823
Bank robbers.

21:18.859 --> 21:23.902
Sometimes working the highways
with their masks and pistols.

21:23.902 --> 21:27.075
Then one night, around
about the Streatham road,

21:27.075 --> 21:28.377
they struck gold.

21:29.345 --> 21:32.318
Gold from Dover
on a mail coach.

21:32.586 --> 21:34.389
Enough money
to last a lifetime.

21:52.024 --> 21:53.026
Thank you, Molly.

22:00.141 --> 22:01.510
Molly, can I ask you
a question?

22:02.646 --> 22:04.082
What is your question?

22:05.118 --> 22:08.090
Do you know two gentlemen
called Magwitch and Compeyson?

22:10.996 --> 22:11.964
No apple sauce, Molly?

22:12.365 --> 22:14.504
I made some with
and some without

22:14.504 --> 22:16.574
in case the gentleman
didn't care for it.

22:16.574 --> 22:18.443
Pip already a gentleman.

22:19.412 --> 22:21.083
What world is this?

22:21.083 --> 22:22.886
One in which a gentleman
has few friends.

22:25.625 --> 22:27.930
Molly, it's too late
for questions.

22:27.930 --> 22:28.999
Go to bed.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.100
And sometimes,

22:30.401 --> 22:32.973
what you learn from inside
a bottle is of value.

22:33.474 --> 22:35.010
You should beware
Mr. Compeyson...

22:35.444 --> 22:37.148
My dear Molly,

22:37.148 --> 22:39.887
do not meddle in affairs
which you do not understand.

22:41.056 --> 22:42.959
Now, I told you to go to bed.

22:44.329 --> 22:45.297
Molly...

22:48.972 --> 22:50.542
Why are you
such a beast to her?

22:52.478 --> 22:53.480
PIP: Molly.

23:04.537 --> 23:05.538
Pip.

23:08.343 --> 23:10.615
I knew you wouldn't get far
without a candle.

23:12.318 --> 23:14.122
I couldn't remember
if there are steps.

23:14.122 --> 23:16.059
And so, consumed by darkness,

23:16.059 --> 23:18.598
you abandoned your pursuit
of the truth.

23:19.366 --> 23:22.105
Mr. Jaggers, when you
send Molly to her bed

23:22.105 --> 23:23.140
do you follow?

23:24.510 --> 23:27.549
Do you use your pass to heaven
for that purpose, too?

23:31.524 --> 23:34.496
You are seeking answers
to your questions.

23:35.999 --> 23:37.001
Very well.

23:39.038 --> 23:40.475
I know Magwitch and Compeyson

23:40.475 --> 23:42.178
because I represented them
in court

23:42.178 --> 23:43.481
when they were being charged

23:43.481 --> 23:45.250
with robbing
the Dover mail coach.

23:46.587 --> 23:48.558
I met Molly because
at the time of the trial,

23:48.558 --> 23:50.695
Molly was Magwitch's wife.

23:51.497 --> 23:55.138
Molly was also the secret lover
of the irresistible Compeyson.

23:55.138 --> 23:56.372
So you see...

23:56.740 --> 24:00.214
It was Molly who divided
the two accomplices

24:00.214 --> 24:03.086
and condemned them
to an eternal battle.

24:04.723 --> 24:06.560
I did see Compeyson tonight.

24:08.263 --> 24:09.533
He brandished a knife.

24:11.604 --> 24:13.474
He said I have something
which belongs to him.

24:13.474 --> 24:14.510
What did he mean?

24:15.044 --> 24:16.548
There are many rather

24:16.548 --> 24:18.584
astonishing elements
to this story.

24:20.254 --> 24:21.323
But as I have said,

24:21.323 --> 24:23.093
there are things
I really can't tell you,

24:23.093 --> 24:24.730
since I am sworn to secrecy.

24:28.403 --> 24:31.376
And everything else aside,
I actually am a man of my word.

24:31.376 --> 24:32.411
(SCOFFS)

24:32.913 --> 24:36.119
And as for me going
to Molly's bed at night...

24:36.119 --> 24:37.154
Well...

24:42.098 --> 24:44.402
As an innocent boy
from the marshes,

24:46.139 --> 24:48.678
you have not yet realized
the truth about me.

24:51.216 --> 24:54.355
And never shall you hear it

24:55.124 --> 24:56.259
from my lips.

25:05.411 --> 25:09.252
But for my sake, Pip,
take this candle.

25:12.659 --> 25:14.496
Light your way to the door,

25:17.335 --> 25:18.538
and go home.

25:59.586 --> 26:00.622

26:01.256 --> 26:02.826

will be beyond rescue,

26:02.826 --> 26:04.161

26:06.366 --> 26:08.103
We will sail to Cairo.

26:09.606 --> 26:11.242
This, I swear on my life.

26:25.805 --> 26:26.807

26:28.811 --> 26:30.581
(STAMMERING) I was gonna

26:31.049 --> 26:32.586
wait for the clock
to strike 7:00

26:32.586 --> 26:34.422
before I knocked the door
to wake you.

26:35.224 --> 26:37.094
But bless me,
you were still not in.

26:38.063 --> 26:41.638
That is to say you are out,
and none of my business it is,

26:41.638 --> 26:44.644
but I'm a little startled
to see you out

26:44.644 --> 26:47.181
and not in
at whatever hour this is.

26:49.152 --> 26:51.089
It is quarter before seven, Joe.

26:52.491 --> 26:53.494
Fine.

26:55.397 --> 26:56.634
What the hell are you doing...

26:59.439 --> 27:00.642

27:35.411 --> 27:36.580
Is there bad news, Joe?

27:36.914 --> 27:38.784
JOE: Not from my end, Pip, no.

27:40.320 --> 27:41.422
Not from my end.

27:44.328 --> 27:45.699
Come in. Come in, Joe.

Yes.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.367
It looks like Herbert forgot
to fetch more.

Well, I'll fetch more
from the cellar.

you've put it out, Pip.

Oh, yes, I am used to cigars.

take me to her home?

to London,

46:24.835 --> 46:25.937
Estella...

46:26.906 --> 46:27.908
I am Magwitch.

46:29.477 --> 46:30.614
I'm your father.

46:47.615 --> 46:49.718
You fire this every night
at 10:30.

46:51.121 --> 46:52.090
Why?

46:52.090 --> 46:54.728
To prove that some things
can be relied on.

46:55.329 --> 46:57.466
But some things do not change.

46:58.035 --> 47:00.372
Just as the river swells
and drains,

47:01.041 --> 47:02.611
Wemmick fires his cannon.

47:06.653 --> 47:07.888
You should go to bed.

47:08.857 --> 47:10.426
You've been awake 48 hours.

47:10.426 --> 47:11.461
How can I sleep?

47:12.330 --> 47:14.034
You just told me
the mysterious fortune

47:14.034 --> 47:15.937
I was given is the proceeds
of a highway robbery.

47:16.906 --> 47:18.777
And the girl I'm in love with
is the daughter

47:18.777 --> 47:20.548
of a cutthroat and a murderer.

47:20.548 --> 47:22.450
But you, Pip, are blameless.

47:23.419 --> 47:25.758
Drawn into all this
by a single act of kindness

47:25.758 --> 47:27.995
one Christmas Eve
on the foggy marshes.

47:32.103 --> 47:33.640
Go to sleep.

47:34.208 --> 47:35.711
In the morning,
if all has gone well,

47:35.711 --> 47:36.979
you can return to your life.

47:37.313 --> 47:39.083
What do you mean,
"If all was gone well"?

47:40.754 --> 47:43.560
How can anything now go well?

47:43.994 --> 47:46.031
Usually in matters
of life and death,

47:46.031 --> 47:48.836
Mr. Jaggers is as reliable
as my old cannon.

47:50.406 --> 47:51.509
Usually.

47:52.511 --> 47:53.981
Lately, since you arrived,

47:53.981 --> 47:56.017
sometimes Mr. Jaggers misfires.

47:56.218 --> 47:59.725
How will I ever take control
of my own destiny?

48:10.079 --> 48:12.684
How do I know you're telling
the truth about who you are?

48:14.087 --> 48:16.125
As I've told you,
I am your father.

48:16.125 --> 48:17.561
No, you're my nothing.

48:18.563 --> 48:19.732
No my absence.

48:20.901 --> 48:22.136
No my no one.

48:25.176 --> 48:27.548
You seem cold. Should we not
go inside the house?

48:27.548 --> 48:28.583
Try to get warm.

48:28.817 --> 48:30.486
I've been frozen my whole life.

48:33.593 --> 48:34.929
What have you been told
about yourself?

48:35.230 --> 48:36.599
That I was thrown away.

48:36.599 --> 48:37.935
You were not thrown.
You were given.

48:37.935 --> 48:39.103
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

48:43.613 --> 48:44.615
I'm sorry.

48:52.531 --> 48:55.971
I don't want apologies,
I want only facts.

48:58.108 --> 48:59.845
Prove to me you know who I am.

49:00.714 --> 49:02.083
(RAIN PATTERING)

49:06.526 --> 49:07.527
Jaggers?

49:08.496 --> 49:10.099
You know as well as I do,

49:10.099 --> 49:12.237
I'm only trying to claim back
from that boy

49:12.237 --> 49:14.440
a fortune
which is rightfully mine.

49:14.975 --> 49:16.512
Not rightfully yours.

49:19.050 --> 49:20.486
It was stolen.

49:23.092 --> 49:28.002
It belonged to Magwitch and me,
by the law of the highway.

49:28.002 --> 49:29.706
Magwitch had no right

49:29.706 --> 49:31.575
to give it away
to some fucking boy

49:32.243 --> 49:34.581
that he met on the marshes.

49:34.815 --> 49:36.585
But give it the way he did.

49:36.952 --> 49:37.954
COMPEYSON: But why?

49:38.890 --> 49:41.962
Why give it to some boy
that he knew for half a day,

49:43.098 --> 49:44.234
and half a night.

49:44.234 --> 49:46.772
JAGGERS: Perhaps because
he found something good in him.

49:47.841 --> 49:50.012
That day on the marshes Magwitch
believed he was going

49:50.012 --> 49:52.551
to spend the rest
of his life in chains.

49:53.319 --> 49:54.922
So he decided
to do a good thing.

49:56.024 --> 49:57.260
When he reached Australia,

49:57.260 --> 49:59.531
he wrote to me
and gave me instructions.

50:00.099 --> 50:01.702
When the boy turns 18,

50:02.103 --> 50:04.742
my instruction was
to bring him to London,

50:04.742 --> 50:06.244
and turn him into a gentleman.

50:07.013 --> 50:10.954
And that, in my own way,
is what I'm doing.

50:11.823 --> 50:13.593
And as the boy's guardian,

50:14.829 --> 50:16.499
I must protect him

50:17.634 --> 50:18.870
from evil men like you.

50:20.139 --> 50:22.176
Dear God , Mr. Jaggers.

50:23.580 --> 50:25.850
An emotion in your eyes.

50:27.186 --> 50:31.194
Recently, a certain melancholy
self-reflection

50:32.263 --> 50:34.067
has led to small changes
in the way

50:34.067 --> 50:35.603
that I deal with the world.

50:37.674 --> 50:38.843
(BOTH GRUNTING)

50:41.014 --> 50:43.787
That is the reason
I have decided

50:43.787 --> 50:46.258
not to blow your
fucking brains out

50:46.258 --> 50:47.894
right here in this alley.

50:48.663 --> 50:49.965
But hear this.

50:50.834 --> 50:52.337
Should you ever be tempted

50:52.337 --> 50:56.746
to come within even one mile
of Pip Gargery ever again...

50:57.147 --> 50:58.717
(EXCLAIMING IN PAIN)

50:58.717 --> 51:01.589
The delicacies
I have in my hand

51:01.589 --> 51:03.225
- will be cut free...
- (SCREAMING)

51:03.225 --> 51:06.566
...and prepared in an onion
gravy and fed to you

51:06.566 --> 51:08.302
in the form of a savory mash.

51:08.302 --> 51:09.938
- Do you understand?
- Yes!

51:10.406 --> 51:12.143
Leave the boy alone.

51:22.363 --> 51:24.267
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

51:30.145 --> 51:31.782
Eighteen years ago,

51:33.352 --> 51:36.090
I was tracked down
to my lodgings by militia.

51:37.126 --> 51:38.228
I escaped.

51:39.832 --> 51:43.105
With stolen gold in my saddle,
and with you in my arms.

51:43.507 --> 51:45.275
Your mother was
taken to a cell.

51:48.683 --> 51:50.653
I rode with you
inside my coat...

51:52.290 --> 51:53.827
To the only person in the world

51:53.827 --> 51:56.599
I knew would take you,
and raise you.

51:57.935 --> 51:59.170
A rich woman,

51:59.939 --> 52:02.711
whose heart I knew was broken
and she lived here,

52:03.245 --> 52:04.648
in this house.

52:05.082 --> 52:06.318
I thought having
a child to care for

52:06.318 --> 52:09.024
might help mend
Miss Havisham's heart.

52:09.024 --> 52:10.292
(SCOFFING)

52:14.334 --> 52:15.770
Her heart didn't mend.

52:16.839 --> 52:18.609
She wears her
wedding dress still.

52:19.277 --> 52:20.379
And all she taught me was

52:20.379 --> 52:22.617
how to break the hearts
of other people.

52:23.987 --> 52:25.757
She sharpened me,

52:27.293 --> 52:30.834
like a blade of a knife.

52:33.907 --> 52:35.777
To be used against all men.

52:38.382 --> 52:40.219
I'm her weapon of revenge.

52:40.219 --> 52:41.856
Out there,
it was against yourself,

52:41.856 --> 52:43.425
you were about to use a blade.

52:43.960 --> 52:45.295
Why?

52:46.933 --> 52:49.070
I am so tired
of feeling nothing.

52:51.174 --> 52:52.811
At least the blade I can feel.

52:53.345 --> 52:54.915
Well, now, I'm returned.

52:56.217 --> 52:57.687
And there'll be change.

52:58.288 --> 52:59.992
I'm here to settle old scores,

52:59.992 --> 53:02.764
and try to undo
some of what I did.

53:05.035 --> 53:07.073
When the sun comes up,
you tell your mama

53:07.073 --> 53:08.108
my name is Magwitch.

53:08.643 --> 53:11.114
Tell her I come with news about
the man who broke her heart.

53:13.953 --> 53:16.959
But I will only give it to her
if she changes her clothes.

53:17.193 --> 53:18.162
You tell her I said,

53:18.162 --> 53:20.465
"Today is the day
when everything changes."

53:48.422 --> 53:50.158
(GROANING)

54:05.890 --> 54:07.459
Weakness, Mr. Jaggers?

54:11.134 --> 54:12.336
Oh, my.

54:17.013 --> 54:19.116
