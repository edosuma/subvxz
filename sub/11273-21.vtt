WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:05.717
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.956
Oh, no.

00:09.120 --> 00:10.599
It's almost 5:00.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.153
What's the problem
with 5:00, Woody?

00:12.320 --> 00:14.834
Well, every day at 5,
this guy comes in

00:15.000 --> 00:18.151
and blabbers and blabbers
and talks my ear off.

00:18.320 --> 00:21.073
- I don't know what to do.
- Why don't you do what I do.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.913
Tell him to shut his fat, ugly mouth.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.355
Oh, no, it's not Mr Clavin.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.278
Woody, Woody.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.829
Calm yourself. There's
no need for concern.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.117
I'm sure he's just a lonely man
who wandered in here one day

00:34.280 --> 00:35.872
and found a sympathetic ear.

00:36.560 --> 00:39.632
Unfortunately, indulging him
will only aggravate the problem.

00:39.800 --> 00:43.554
You see, people in this situation have
a tendency to prattle on endlessly,

00:43.720 --> 00:45.438
totally unaware of how
others are receiving

00:45.600 --> 00:47.830
this unwanted, innocuous information.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.999
Now, the next time
a neurotic personality such as this

00:51.200 --> 00:52.997
gets off on one of these jags,

00:53.160 --> 00:55.151
just turn your back and walk away.

00:55.360 --> 00:58.796
Because, you see,
the important thing is, well...

01:00.520 --> 01:02.988
Well, just a second, I was...

01:03.280 --> 01:05.748
Oh, you merry band.

02:15.440 --> 02:16.839
- Diane here yet?
- No, no.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.389
Miss Tardy-Slip is late again.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.032
She probably stopped somewhere

02:22.200 --> 02:25.795
to think up another lame-o excuse
for being late in the first place.

02:25.960 --> 02:27.109
I'm sorry I'm late.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.791
I was taking a nap,
and I forgot to set my alarm.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.633
And my down comforter
felt so toasty.

02:33.800 --> 02:37.429
Well, you know me.
I'm something of a slumber cat.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.159
Jack Dalton called.

02:42.800 --> 02:46.839
Oh, my God. Jack Dalton?

02:47.000 --> 02:50.117
I haven't heard that name for months.
Jack Dalton.

02:50.560 --> 02:52.710
- Who is he?
- Nobody.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.109
Well, Mr Nobody just landed
his private jet at Hyannis Port

02:56.280 --> 02:58.669
and is coming over
to see you right now.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.990
You never mentioned this guy
to me. How come?

03:01.160 --> 03:05.039
Well, there's not much to say.
He's a man I dated a bit in Europe.

03:05.240 --> 03:07.117
Was that before or after
you dumped Dr Crane

03:07.280 --> 03:09.840
and sent him into
an alcoholic tailspin?

03:11.880 --> 03:13.632
After.

03:14.120 --> 03:15.314
How long after?

03:17.560 --> 03:18.959
Days.

03:19.120 --> 03:22.351
I met Jack at the running of the bulls
in Pamplona.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.319
Isn't that just like a woman?

03:24.480 --> 03:26.311
While I wept bitterly
into the Adriatic,

03:26.480 --> 03:30.359
she was busy dodging bovines
in sunny Spain.

03:30.520 --> 03:33.114
Frasier, I was upset.
I would have done anything.

03:33.880 --> 03:37.270
I wasn't running to Jack,
I was running away from you.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.149
Well, I feel better now.

03:41.560 --> 03:44.233
As fortune would have it,
Jack came into my life at that point,

03:44.400 --> 03:48.712
and his love of danger
intoxicated me.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.838
If he said, "Let's try
the luge run at St Moritz,"

03:52.000 --> 03:53.592
I said, "Why not."

03:53.960 --> 03:58.397
I guess for a brief while,
I was danger's mistress.

03:58.840 --> 04:02.355
Is there anyone whose mistress
you weren't?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.274
Put a cork in it, Frasier.

04:07.920 --> 04:11.515
Jack is from a period in my life
that I would

04:11.680 --> 04:14.513
rather put behind me.
I'm more mature now.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.351
More centred.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.160
Sam, I'm going to hide in the back.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.993
When Jack comes,
just tell him I'm dead.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.838
Chambers!

04:27.120 --> 04:28.599
Jack.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.436
Diane's dead.

04:34.440 --> 04:38.115
- Still light as a bird, huh?
- Oh, Jack.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.714
Listen, I want you
to meet everybody.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.393
This is Carla Tortelli.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.750
Tortelli!

04:45.920 --> 04:49.037
Easy, Hercules. I just had chilli.

04:52.440 --> 04:55.159
- I'm Woody Boyd.
- Boyd!

04:58.160 --> 05:01.038
- I'm Cliff Clavin.
- Clavin!

05:08.480 --> 05:10.357
Norm Peterson.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.391
Norm.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.038
I got a whistle to wet.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.475
Hey, barkeep,

05:19.640 --> 05:21.631
how'd you like to arm-wrestle me
for a beer?

05:21.800 --> 05:22.994
Hey, all right!

05:23.200 --> 05:24.918
Alrighty, but I have to warn you,

05:25.080 --> 05:28.390
I was arm-wrestling champion
of Posey County.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.477
- Fair enough.
- All right.

05:30.680 --> 05:33.399
One, two, three...

05:35.120 --> 05:38.669
Ladies and gents,
the new champ of Posey County.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.032
All right, who's next?

05:41.240 --> 05:42.229
Thanks, not me.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.239
You look like you could give me
a run for my money.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.271
I think I'll take a rain check.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.233
Come on, man,
just for the sport of it.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.197
Jack, I'll buy you the beer.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.191
You don't have to beat
everybody in the bar.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.313
What makes you think
I'm gonna lose?

05:58.480 --> 06:00.516
Sam Malone here.
I'm the owner of the bar,

06:00.680 --> 06:02.352
and I've yet to lose a beer in it.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.154
Well, there's a first time
for everything.

06:06.680 --> 06:11.276
One, two, three...

06:12.720 --> 06:16.156
So how long you in town for?

06:18.200 --> 06:21.875
Just for the day. I'm on my way
to the Air Races in Reno.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.197
Reno? Yeah, that's lovely
this time of year.

06:25.360 --> 06:28.318
Beautiful.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.670
Well, I guess I owe you a beer here.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.788
Diane, how the hell are you?

06:37.720 --> 06:39.631
I'm fine. I'm fine.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.552
My God, you look pale.

06:41.720 --> 06:44.757
You folks should've seen her
frolicking in the surf at Mykonos.

06:44.920 --> 06:47.673
Her little bottom was
as brown as a berry.

06:51.600 --> 06:54.273
The stick running around
buck-naked?

06:54.680 --> 06:59.151
- It was a semiprivate beach.
- Used to be a semiprivate bottom.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.397
So, Jack, what's been happening
with you lately?

07:05.560 --> 07:08.950
Oh, nothing much.
I spent most of last year in Tibet

07:09.120 --> 07:12.954
centring my consciousness with
secrets from the Book of the Dead.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.639
Fun place, Tibet.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.671
I studied under this Buddhist monk

07:16.840 --> 07:19.593
who had such a pixyish
sense of humour.

07:20.160 --> 07:22.151
I remember this one
particular morning.

07:22.320 --> 07:24.709
We were clad in goatskin.

07:24.920 --> 07:28.310
The sun was just coming
over the Himalayas.

07:28.520 --> 07:33.640
At that moment I took my first trip
out of my body to nirvana.

07:33.840 --> 07:36.752
A trip like that
could well be deductible.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.515
See, well, I'm a CPA.

07:39.680 --> 07:41.591
Unemployed CPA.

07:41.760 --> 07:44.320
Kind of a funny, unemployed CPA.

07:48.360 --> 07:52.399
Mr Dalton, you've had so many bizarre
and terrifying experiences.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.909
Some people say that I have
a death wish. Far from it.

07:55.400 --> 07:59.279
- I have a life wish.
- Yeah, so does Normie.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.557
- What, what, what?
- He wishes he had one.

08:03.960 --> 08:08.078
Hey, Chambers!
Come on, tell us all about you.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.117
Now, the last time I saw you,

08:10.320 --> 08:13.357
you turned down my offer
to travel around the world

08:13.520 --> 08:16.432
because you had a secret love
back in Boston.

08:16.600 --> 08:17.953
Baseball player, wasn't it?

08:18.160 --> 08:20.754
Yes, Mickey Mantle.
It didn't work out.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.674
I always say the best remedy
for unrequited love

08:24.840 --> 08:27.957
is a trip around the world on a raft.

08:28.160 --> 08:29.912
Sound tempting?

08:31.520 --> 08:35.751
Jack, I feel kind of settled now.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.717
I'll admit that when
you knew me in Europe,

08:37.880 --> 08:41.111
it was important for me
to test myself that way.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.635
And I was rather fearless.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.918
But that was the nadir
of my existence.

08:46.120 --> 08:49.795
My life now is complete and happy,
and I'm scared of my own shadow.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.797
Well, the least you can do
is give me this evening.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.155
Come on, take a spin
in my new plane.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.157
I'll show you what that baby can do.

08:59.320 --> 09:02.039
Hey, what kind of aircraft
you got up there, Dalton?

09:02.200 --> 09:03.633
Messerschmitt? Fokker?

09:03.960 --> 09:05.473
No, it's a Bobcat

09:05.680 --> 09:09.070
with a couple of Pratt & Whitney
JT1 5D-1A engines.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.834
Twenty-two hundred pounds
of thrust apiece.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.150
Hey, good little birdy.

09:14.360 --> 09:15.918
Come on, Diane, let's go.

09:16.520 --> 09:17.919
Jack...

09:18.080 --> 09:20.116
...thank you for your kind invitation,

09:20.280 --> 09:24.637
but Sam couldn't possibly let me go
at the beginning of my shift.

09:24.840 --> 09:27.195
Oh, hey, it's kind of slow tonight.
Why don't you go.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.156
May I speak with you
a moment, Sam?

09:34.640 --> 09:37.791
I'd really rather not go flying tonight.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.748
- What?
- Sam, please.

09:41.920 --> 09:46.277
Tell him I have to work tonight,
and I couldn't possibly accompany him.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.118
I have a better idea.
Why don't you do it.

09:48.280 --> 09:51.670
You were his berry-bottomed baby.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.156
Maybe you're right.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.830
It's up to me.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.596
Oh, Jack.

10:03.160 --> 10:07.278
I think it would be better
if I didn't go out with you tonight.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.313
No, no, no. Say it ain't so.

10:10.520 --> 10:13.318
The crazy, impulsive Diane
I knew in Europe

10:13.480 --> 10:19.396
has turned into Miss Nine-to-Five,
Play-lt-Safe, Dare-l-Eat-a-Peach?

10:21.200 --> 10:22.474
What a shame.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.116
So long, Diane.

10:26.280 --> 10:29.272
- Well, you don't have to be angry.
- I'm not angry.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.193
I'm just sad at what's lost.

10:32.360 --> 10:35.636
The army of dullness
has recruited another soul.

10:43.240 --> 10:46.596
Well, a little spin doesn't sound so bad.
It's a very clear night.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.028
Hey!

10:48.240 --> 10:50.959
Does the woman ever say no?

10:53.600 --> 10:55.716
Only to you.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.398
Jack, just one thing.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.710
Would you mind
if Sam accompanies us?

11:00.920 --> 11:02.433
Wait, how'd I get on board this thing?

11:02.640 --> 11:04.596
May I speak with you again?

11:04.760 --> 11:06.478
What do you want?

11:06.920 --> 11:10.469
Sam, it would mean
a great deal to me

11:10.640 --> 11:12.392
if you came along for protection.

11:12.600 --> 11:16.673
He's not the kind of man
I trust myself to be alone with.

11:16.840 --> 11:19.638
Oh, yeah. Like me, you mean?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.831
You do understand.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.110
Okay, all right.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.396
Jack? I guess I'm coming along.

11:27.560 --> 11:29.516
Hey, the more the merrier.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.989
- Malone!
- Don't do that.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.872
- Shall we go?
- Yeah, I guess so.

11:34.040 --> 11:35.189
Hey, you know, Dalton,

11:35.360 --> 11:37.749
a spin up in that little birdy of yours
sure sounds inviting.

11:37.920 --> 11:41.435
- Yeah, they'll tell you all about it.
- Yeah, I guess they will.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.595
This is truly lovely.

11:56.160 --> 11:59.516
The moon and stars
our only companions

11:59.680 --> 12:02.672
as we gently brush aside
the billowing clouds.

12:03.440 --> 12:06.273
- Diane, take the controls.
- What? What'd you say?

12:06.440 --> 12:08.670
Me? I know nothing about flying.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.916
Well, just put both hands
on this like this.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.793
That's right. Attagirl.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.190
Okay, I heard something
rattling around in back there.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.998
Gotta go secure it.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.469
Come on, Sam.
Why don't you sit up there.

12:19.640 --> 12:22.552
That's it.
Come on, the view's great.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.314
Okay, now, just fly her
steady as she goes.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.789
Don't touch any controls.
Don't touch anything.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.428
You're headed in the right direction.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.797
Hi, Diane.

12:47.880 --> 12:51.714
Hey, Jack? What do you call
this steering-wheel thing here?

12:51.880 --> 12:54.235
It's called a steering wheel.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.675
No, I'm just kidding.
It's called a yoke.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.195
A bad yoke.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.235
This is so frightening.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.719
And yet exhilarating.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.313
It's okay. It's okay.

13:07.760 --> 13:10.354
I think we're getting
the hang of this, Sam.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.677
Yeah. Yeah.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.598
Feeling pretty powerful, huh?

13:14.800 --> 13:20.033
Well, I have to admit,
I kind of feel like I own the sky.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.598
- Jack is really something, isn't he?
- Are you kidding me?

13:25.760 --> 13:27.557
I mean...

13:27.720 --> 13:29.676
...I could do all that macho stuff
if I wanted to,

13:29.840 --> 13:31.876
but it wouldn't make me
any more of a man.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.153
Do I detect a hint
of raised consciousness?

13:38.320 --> 13:40.993
Yeah. I mean, a real guy
doesn't have to jump on sharks

13:41.160 --> 13:44.232
and dodge poison darts
just to prove he's a guy.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.350
I'm astonished.

13:47.520 --> 13:50.717
A real guy just has to score heavy
with the babes, that's all.

13:55.480 --> 13:56.833
Hey, Jack.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.275
Hey, Jack, you know,
I have to admit, you're right.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.510
This is kind of fun.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.592
Jack? Yo, Jack?

14:04.960 --> 14:08.873
Well, he couldn't have gone too far.
Unless he bailed out.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.792
- Jack?
- Jack?

14:28.320 --> 14:30.470
Sam? He's dead.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.756
- What do you mean dead?
- I mean "dead," dead.

14:32.920 --> 14:34.876
- He hasn't got a pulse.
- Oh, come on.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.951
I can't believe a guy
like that's ever gonna die.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.390
Yeah? Well, trust me.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.355
Like hell I will.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.751
We're going to crash.
We're going to die.

14:52.920 --> 14:57.277
They'll check out our dental records
to identify our remains.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.629
And I haven't been to Dr Oberding
for as much as a polish

15:00.800 --> 15:02.791
in over six months.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.473
- He's dead.
- I know, dead.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.519
Okay.

15:08.680 --> 15:10.352
All right, but we're not dead yet.

15:10.520 --> 15:11.839
No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.752
All right.
All right, I saw this movie once

15:13.920 --> 15:17.549
where this perfectly ordinary lady
had to land this airliner.

15:17.720 --> 15:20.951
So all we gotta do now is make radio
contact with some guy on the ground,

15:21.120 --> 15:24.192
and he'll talk us down
onto the runway.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.271
What do you remember?
Wait, what do you remember?

15:26.480 --> 15:29.950
I remember thinking that, "These
people are in a lot of trouble."

15:32.480 --> 15:34.630
Sam, we're going to die.

15:34.840 --> 15:38.355
Hey, hey. Do you mind, please?
I'm in complete control here, Diane.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.670
I just gotta find the damn radio,
that's all.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.879
How do you know
which one is the radio?

15:43.040 --> 15:44.155
- I don't.
- Will you stop

15:44.320 --> 15:46.595
indiscriminately pushing buttons?

15:47.800 --> 15:51.110
Oh, my God. I don't wanna die.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.430
- You're not making this any easier.
- We're too young.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.955
Just relax, will you?
I mean, we're still flying, aren't we?

15:56.120 --> 15:59.032
We're still going
in a basically straight line here.

15:59.200 --> 16:02.875
And we got plenty of fuel, according
to the fuel-gauge thing there.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.391
That's a clock.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.671
Well, all right. It's early.

16:10.880 --> 16:14.031
We've still got a lot of time
to sort this whole thing out.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.556
Damn.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.748
You're right, you're right.
We're still aloft.

16:19.920 --> 16:22.275
Maybe somebody will pick us up
on their radar or something

16:22.440 --> 16:25.273
and talk us down,
and everything will be wonderful.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.876
- Oh, Sam, what did you do?
- I don't know.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.951
Well, don't do it again.
We're sinking.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.556
No, don't be silly.
Ships sink. Planes...

16:34.960 --> 16:37.520
All right, I'm gonna pull back
on this thing here. Right here.

16:37.680 --> 16:39.033
Okay, here I go. All right?

16:39.200 --> 16:40.918
- Oh, this is good.
- All right. All right.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.229
- Yeah, yeah.
- This is good.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.992
- Yeah, yeah.
- Absolutely wonderful.

16:44.680 --> 16:46.750
Okay, all right.
All right, now we're back.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.512
Normal here.

16:48.680 --> 16:50.910
I'm just gonna keep looking
for this damn radio.

16:51.080 --> 16:54.390
Please, please, please,
please, please.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.632
- Look out!
- Will you stop that!

16:57.800 --> 17:00.519
People don't fly well when people
are screaming in their ears.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.992
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.952
Good God, please, please.
Oh, God, please.

17:12.319 --> 17:15.596
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.598
- Sam, I think we're going down.
- Yeah, I think so too.

17:19.760 --> 17:22.558
Oh, God, I can't believe this.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.439
All right. All right. All right.

17:24.599 --> 17:28.957
Let's just have a little dignity here
and try to be calm, huh?

17:29.120 --> 17:30.678
- How do we do that?
- Oh, Jesus.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.513
I don't know. I don't know.
Talk about something.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.432
- Like what?
- Anything. Talk about anything.

17:35.600 --> 17:39.752
Talk about all the good things
that have happened to us, huh?

17:40.520 --> 17:42.351
Good things?

17:42.520 --> 17:45.239
What about all the things
that are never gonna happen?

17:45.400 --> 17:48.836
I'm never gonna get married.
I'm never gonna have a baby.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.879
I'm never gonna get old.
I don't even have a grey hair.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.477
- Sure you do, right there.
- I do? Where?

17:57.120 --> 17:59.350
- Oh, please, please.
- Sam, hold me.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.829
Oh, God.

18:03.120 --> 18:05.350
Oh, it would have been us
one of these days, wouldn't it?

18:05.520 --> 18:07.351
You and me married?

18:09.640 --> 18:11.358
Yeah, yeah.

18:12.200 --> 18:16.113
- Little Sams and Dianes running...
- Oh, yeah.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.479
Oh, God.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.632
Why didn't I ask you
when I had the chance?

18:21.920 --> 18:24.514
- Why did I go to Europe?
- Oh, it's okay.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.557
- At least we're going together.
- Yeah.

18:26.760 --> 18:28.796
I love it.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.910
Jack, what the hell
are you doing alive?

18:36.200 --> 18:38.077
Dalton, fly the damn plane.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.832
It was a little trick I learned in Tibet.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.197
I slowed my metabolism down
to a heartbeat a minute.

18:43.360 --> 18:46.272
- Why the hell did you do that, Jack?
- Fly the damn plane, will you, man.

18:46.440 --> 18:48.510
- This is about to crash.
- Oh, we're not gonna crash.

18:48.680 --> 18:51.353
- We're at 20,000 feet.
- Big deal, Jack.

18:51.520 --> 18:55.718
Hey, relax, folks.
You were on autopilot the whole time.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.558
Well, you were when I left.

18:57.720 --> 19:01.429
Who's been screwing around
with the controls here, huh?

19:02.200 --> 19:05.988
That was the rottenest, stupidest,
sleaziest thing anyone's ever done.

19:06.200 --> 19:09.192
Chambers, I saw comfortable
and safe and domestic

19:09.360 --> 19:11.590
written all over your face tonight
and couldn't stand it.

19:11.760 --> 19:13.591
You needed this. You too, Malone.

19:13.760 --> 19:15.034
You needed a step to the brink.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.156
You needed to look into
the gaping maw of death

19:17.320 --> 19:18.799
and live to tell about it.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.599
I'm gonna stick my fist
in your gaping maw.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.796
Oh, no, you won't.
You'll live to thank me.

19:23.960 --> 19:25.473
From this day forward, you're reborn.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.676
Everything in your life's
gonna be better.

19:27.880 --> 19:30.110
- You're crazy.
- Food is gonna taste better.

19:30.320 --> 19:32.311
- I don't care.
- Flowers are gonna smell better.

19:32.480 --> 19:35.517
- You're nuts.
- Sex is gonna feel better.

19:42.360 --> 19:45.193
Well, I never want to see you again
as long as I live.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.078
You're a big, dangerous baby,
Jack Dalton.

19:47.240 --> 19:50.516
- That's right, yeah.
- And regressing at a rapid pace.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.274
You know something? You know,
I feel like punching your lights out.

19:53.440 --> 19:56.113
Sam. Sam, he's the only one that
knows how to land the plane.

19:56.280 --> 19:58.874
That's right.
Okay, all right, all right.

19:59.040 --> 20:02.715
Yeah, but when we get on the ground,
you are dog meat, friend.

20:07.360 --> 20:10.432
So, Sam, you never did tell us
how you got that shiner.

20:11.280 --> 20:13.840
We hit some turbulence there,
and l...

20:14.000 --> 20:16.719
...knocked myself into
the alta-gyroscope thing.

20:16.920 --> 20:21.436
Oh, boy, when are they ever gonna
recess those things, huh?

20:23.520 --> 20:26.353
Is that gizmo there
in the shape of a fist?

20:27.120 --> 20:29.793
All right, so Dalton caught me
with a sucker punch.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.872
- Yeah, but you should see him.
- We got even.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.315
We told the FAA on him.

20:35.800 --> 20:40.510
So, what did you guys talk about when
you thought you were gonna die?

20:42.600 --> 20:43.828
Oh, I don't know...

20:45.240 --> 20:46.878
You remember anything, Diane?

20:48.720 --> 20:50.153
Not a word.

20:50.320 --> 20:53.039
There were a lot of frightening
things going on.

20:54.200 --> 20:58.318
Well, I'm kind of tired.
I'm gonna get ready to go.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.274
Well, you know, Normie,
all this talk of danger

21:03.440 --> 21:06.557
has inspired me to go out
and do something really crazy, eh?

21:07.280 --> 21:09.635
What do you say you and me

21:09.800 --> 21:12.394
go out and ring some doorbells
and run away, eh?

21:12.560 --> 21:13.549
Yeah, yeah.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.196
Mind if I get going, Sam?

21:17.360 --> 21:19.396
In ten minutes, my sitter's
going on overtime,

21:19.560 --> 21:21.312
and my kids ain't worth
a buck an hour.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.117
- Go, go. Yeah.
- Thanks. You're a pal.

21:25.520 --> 21:28.239
Hey, Sam, I want you to know,

21:28.600 --> 21:30.795
if I'm ever in a life-or-death situation

21:30.960 --> 21:34.794
and things look hopeless,
like there's no way of getting out alive,

21:34.960 --> 21:36.996
I want you there with me.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.992
Thanks, buddy.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.039
No, no, wait.
Don't leave me here with...

21:45.600 --> 21:46.999
Where did everybody go?

21:47.920 --> 21:49.831
Oh, home, I guess.

21:53.840 --> 21:57.310
- Well, I guess I'll do the same.
- Yeah.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.630
Quite a night, right, Sam?

21:59.800 --> 22:01.995
Yeah, quite a night.

22:03.760 --> 22:05.352
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

22:07.440 --> 22:10.193
Look, Sam...

22:12.400 --> 22:17.155
...some things were said between us
that have never been said before.

22:17.320 --> 22:20.869
And they were said
because we were facing death.

22:21.080 --> 22:24.516
And now that the crisis is over,

22:24.680 --> 22:27.558
I think we should set aside
some of those things

22:28.520 --> 22:30.988
for when we can
better deal with them.

22:31.160 --> 22:32.673
What I'm trying to say is

22:32.840 --> 22:36.116
that I think we should,
for the time being,

22:36.280 --> 22:39.192
forget what was said on that plane.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.789
Hey, what plane, huh?

22:43.000 --> 22:46.231
The plane where you said
your deepest desire was to marry me.

22:57.880 --> 23:00.838
Oh, yeah, that plane.
