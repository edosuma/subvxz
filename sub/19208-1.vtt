(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON PHONE)

11:36.829 --> 11:38.030
No, I'm not talking to you.

11:38.097 --> 11:39.532
I'm not saying you look like a ghost.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.200
I would never say that about you.

11:41.267 --> 11:44.937
So, that's why everyone was screaming
when they saw you, Shaggy.

11:45.004 --> 11:47.506
Like, they all thought I was a ghost!

11:47.574 --> 11:49.642
A little tanning will help with that.

11:49.709 --> 11:54.180
Yes, it makes you look much more
alive and attractive.

11:54.246 --> 11:55.514
Debbie...

11:55.582 --> 11:57.083
Desdemona!

11:57.149 --> 11:58.317
Guh!

11:58.384 --> 12:02.388
Hang on a second,
you must be Norville Rogers.

12:02.454 --> 12:03.790
Call me Shaggy.

12:03.856 --> 12:07.159
It's just amazing.
Come on with me.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.728
Tawny's gotta see this.

12:09.295 --> 12:10.296
(GULPS)

12:13.432 --> 12:16.235
(GASPS) It's unbelievable.

12:16.302 --> 12:17.536
Uncanny.

12:17.604 --> 12:18.971
Unreal.

12:19.038 --> 12:20.472
Uncomfortable.

12:20.539 --> 12:22.474
You look exactly like him.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.343
Like, like who?

12:24.410 --> 12:26.212
Dapper Jack Rogers.

12:26.278 --> 12:30.583
Our ancestor and the greatest outlaw
these parts have ever seen.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.985
- Ruh-roh.
- (GULPS)

12:33.052 --> 12:35.287
Whoa, you look just like him, Shaggy.

12:35.354 --> 12:37.690
It could be you on Halloween.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.059
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself.

12:40.126 --> 12:43.262
I'm Tawny Rogers, your third
cousin, twice removed.

12:43.329 --> 12:47.199
(CHUCKLES) Like, thank you
for the invitation, cuz.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.434
Oh, heck.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.703
Just an opportunity
to get to know a relative.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.373
Excuse me, did someone say something
about a ghost earlier?

12:54.440 --> 12:57.476
Yeah, that guy threatened
to turn me into one.

12:57.543 --> 12:59.511
Uh, I said I was sorry.

12:59.578 --> 13:03.182
The ghost of Dapper Jack
has been terrorizing the town.

13:03.249 --> 13:05.885
The place seemed practically deserted.

13:05.952 --> 13:09.055
Yeah. A lot of businesses
have closed down already.

13:09.121 --> 13:12.391
I would think having a ghost in
a ghost town would help business.

13:12.458 --> 13:13.926
Well, not this one.

13:13.993 --> 13:17.730
He's terrifying, and he shoots
green flames and he...

13:17.797 --> 13:19.766
He smells fairly bad.

13:19.832 --> 13:21.100
Like, how come nobody in my family

13:21.167 --> 13:23.302
ever mentioned this famous relative?

13:23.369 --> 13:26.839
Probably because he's mostly famous
for having been a violent gun slinger.

13:26.906 --> 13:32.511
So evil, his ghost has come back
to terrorize the whole town.

13:32.578 --> 13:34.113
(SCOOBY AND SHAGGY WHIMPER)

13:34.180 --> 13:37.616
Well, looks like we've got
another mystery on our hands.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.185
Oh, man.

13:39.251 --> 13:42.188
I can't believe my most famous
ancestor was an outlaw.

13:42.254 --> 13:45.992
What if it's in my blood?
What if I go bad? (GASPS)

13:46.058 --> 13:48.160
That time at first grade,
where I stole the cookie.

13:48.227 --> 13:52.364
This totally explains it!
I'm bad to the bone!

13:52.431 --> 13:54.834
Settle down, Shaggy.

13:54.901 --> 13:57.737
Rafe, can you tell us more
about Dapper Jack?

13:57.804 --> 14:01.974
The tourists always want to hear
stories about Dapper Jack.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.843
Well...

14:03.910 --> 14:08.380
Dapper Jack Rogers was about
the orneriest guss this town had ever seen.

14:08.447 --> 14:09.448
(LAUGHS)

14:09.515 --> 14:11.183
He terrorized Sorghum City

14:11.250 --> 14:14.921
- along with his giant ferocious dog Atlas.
- (BARKING)

14:14.987 --> 14:16.989
- They were cattle thieves,
- (MOOING)

14:17.056 --> 14:18.858
- bank robbers.
- (BELL RINGING)

14:18.925 --> 14:20.492
They stole from everyone,

14:20.559 --> 14:23.863
- from old ladies to orphans,
- (EXCLAIMS)

14:23.930 --> 14:25.732
- from farmers,
- (YELPS)

14:25.798 --> 14:27.734
- to school marms.
- (SCREAMS)

14:27.800 --> 14:31.070
He cheated at cards, robbed the poor box

14:31.137 --> 14:33.139
and returned his library books late!

14:33.205 --> 14:34.273
(JACK LAUGHS)

14:34.340 --> 14:36.675
Jack was always a slave to fashion.

14:36.743 --> 14:42.114
Legend has it, he once shot a man for
wearing white shoes after Labor Day.

14:42.181 --> 14:44.683
In short, he was the foulest,

14:44.751 --> 14:50.422
vilest, low-down, dirtiest no-account
human being to ever walk the Earth!

14:50.489 --> 14:53.826
And consequently,
quite a tourist attraction.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.428
Did anyone else picture
Scooby-Doo as the dog?

14:56.495 --> 14:57.663
- Uh-huh.
- You bet.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.499
- I pictured him with a mustache.
- Hmm.

15:00.566 --> 15:04.236
Yep, Dapper Jack made this
town miserable for years

15:04.303 --> 15:08.775
until Sheriff Rufus Carmichael
finally took care of it.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.276
Carmichael wrote a book about it

15:10.342 --> 15:13.012
that was pretty popular
a hundred or so years ago.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.747
His tales of Dapper Jack

15:14.814 --> 15:16.983
were what brought the tourists
here in the first place.

15:17.049 --> 15:19.185
Now they come to hear the legend.

15:19.251 --> 15:23.455
And also because of
the Crazy Q's fancy website.

15:23.522 --> 15:25.191
Did you see it?
Made it myself.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.194
- Pretty darn professional, huh?
- (ANGRILY) Yeah.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.228
Nice font.

15:29.295 --> 15:32.598
Yup, I purely love that El Kabong.

15:32.664 --> 15:34.300
Whoo-hoo!

15:34.366 --> 15:37.503
Well, guess I better see
to our other guests.

15:37.569 --> 15:38.971
Nice to meet you all!

15:40.106 --> 15:41.540
Hey, thanks for coming out.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.475
I'm looking forward to
getting to know you, cousin.

15:43.542 --> 15:47.513
Yeah. Kind of a bummer our ancestor
was such a jerk though, huh?

15:47.579 --> 15:50.682
These are just the stories
they tell tourists, Shaggy.

15:50.749 --> 15:54.553
We'll have to dig up more information
about Dapper Jack while we're here.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.022
You're welcome to try.

15:56.088 --> 15:58.057
But I've been hearing
all about him all my life.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.192
And I ain't heard nothing good yet.

16:00.259 --> 16:02.561
Now, who's ready for some...

16:02.628 --> 16:03.930
Lunch, lunch, lunch, lunch.

16:03.996 --> 16:05.397
Lunch, lunch, lunch, lunch.

16:05.464 --> 16:08.234
Now, how do they know I was
going to say lunch?

16:08.300 --> 16:11.103
They're pretty much psychic
when it comes to food.

16:14.740 --> 16:15.942

16:21.613 --> 16:22.982
My tummy is growling.

16:23.049 --> 16:26.518
Like, shouldn't there be
a room service menu?

16:29.055 --> 16:31.123
Not real... Fancy.

16:31.190 --> 16:33.425
Hmm. If the ghost
shows up tonight,

16:33.492 --> 16:37.096
should I go with the nylon net or silk?

16:37.163 --> 16:40.066
Yeah, the nylon is stronger,
but silk is more transparent,

16:40.132 --> 16:42.869
thus, more difficult to see.

16:43.735 --> 16:46.305
Now, the Net Master 3000

16:46.372 --> 16:49.008
with the double reinforced
weave is a good choice.

16:49.075 --> 16:50.509
But it's more of an autumn net,

16:50.576 --> 16:53.312
good for a wild game
and the occasional Sasquatch.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.114
(GASPS) Of course,
the Amaz-a-net

16:55.181 --> 16:58.550
has come out with a new model
that I'm dying to try out!

16:58.617 --> 17:02.488
Yeah, but I haven't had a chance
to do any clinical trials.

17:02.554 --> 17:03.555
Hmm...

17:05.723 --> 17:07.492
Like, when is second dinner?

17:07.559 --> 17:09.461
Yeah, second dinner?

17:09.528 --> 17:10.896

17:13.098 --> 17:15.166

before we finish breakfast,

22:30.816 --> 22:34.620
I think the allergy medicine
is starting to wear off.

22:34.686 --> 22:37.423
Yeah, some company called
Black Rattler Management

22:37.489 --> 22:41.227
has been buying up all the failed
businesses at bargain rates.

22:41.293 --> 22:43.795
They've offered to buy
the ranch, but I've...

22:43.862 --> 22:46.932
Well, I've lived here my whole life.

22:46.998 --> 22:48.234
I just...

22:48.300 --> 22:49.835
I can't leave, I...

22:49.901 --> 22:51.237
Hey.

22:51.303 --> 22:53.239
We'll get to the bottom
of this ghost thing.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.207
It'll be okay.

22:55.274 --> 22:58.977

out more about Dapper Jack in town.

Fastest shoer in the West.

Meet us out by the barn later.

isn't gonna know what hit it.

anything clue-shaped then.

Come on, Scoob, let's see
what you can sniff out.

take you back to the barn.

horse, he's a pedigreed Great Dane.

Yeah, pedigreed!

a talking tree anyway?

26:22.514 --> 26:23.982
Uh, what?

26:24.049 --> 26:27.953

of my nearsightedness.

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:34.569
So he framed him for cattle rustling.

01:09:34.636 --> 01:09:37.240
He turned the whole town against him.

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:42.444
Here he says he had
trouble catching Jack

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.979
because of his amazing
abilities on horseback.

01:09:45.048 --> 01:09:48.951
Which as you've all seen his descendant,
Shaggy, inherited from him.

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:52.720
Does he say anything about not
being able to grow a full beard?

01:09:52.787 --> 01:09:55.958
'Cause I definitely inherited
that from someone.

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:57.660
Now, listen to this.

01:09:57.726 --> 01:10:00.896
May 17th, 1867.

01:10:00.963 --> 01:10:03.399
"Finally caught Dapper Jack
by Minschel Pike.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.302
"He was a fast draw,

01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:09.872
"but a poor shot.

01:10:09.938 --> 01:10:15.478
"As it turns out, Jack Rogers was more
useful dead than he ever was alive.

01:10:15.544 --> 01:10:17.613
"I can commit all manner of crimes

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.383
"and blame Dapper Jack,
the great outlaw.

01:10:20.449 --> 01:10:23.352
"The whole town curses his name.

01:10:23.419 --> 01:10:26.622
"One day, I will simply
disappear for a week or so

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:29.092
"and return with the tale
of tracking down

01:10:29.158 --> 01:10:31.227
"and ending Dapper Jack.

01:10:31.294 --> 01:10:33.896
"I will be remembered forever as a hero,

01:10:33.962 --> 01:10:39.935
while Jack Rogers' name goes
down in the annals of infamy."

01:10:40.002 --> 01:10:44.140
Well, clearly, this sheriff was
a byproduct of bad parenting.

01:10:44.207 --> 01:10:48.043
Just as Sheriff Carmichael used
Dapper Jack to steal from the town,

01:10:48.111 --> 01:10:52.515
someone else is now using Dapper
Jack's ghost to steal from the town.

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:55.684
And that someone is... Rafe!

01:10:55.751 --> 01:10:57.320

(GRUNTS)

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:07.263

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.602
Howdy, partner.

01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:15.871
Nice roping, Scooby-Doo.

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:17.673
It was you?

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:18.874
But why?

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:20.543
(SIGHS)

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:22.578
I lined up a deal with a
company that builds resorts.

01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:25.248
They offered millions
for the Sorghum City area.

01:11:25.314 --> 01:11:27.683
But why would you pretend to be a ghost?

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:31.687
The company wanted to theme the resort
around Dapper Jack, the outlaw.

01:11:31.754 --> 01:11:33.856
So I came up with a fake ghost.

01:11:33.922 --> 01:11:36.292
It would build up interest
in the outlaw stories.

01:11:36.359 --> 01:11:38.561
And, it would scare people off,

01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:41.297
so I could buy their land
through my company,

01:11:41.364 --> 01:11:43.132
Black Rattler Management.

01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:44.933
How did you know it was me?

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.471
Simple, you said you built the
dude ranch's website yourself,

01:11:48.537 --> 01:11:51.307
and you used El Kabong font.

01:11:51.374 --> 01:11:53.409
No professional would use that font.

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:56.612
No one with any taste
or self-respect would...

01:11:56.679 --> 01:11:58.314
Easy there, Velma.

01:11:58.381 --> 01:12:00.449
Anyway, I saw the font again

01:12:00.516 --> 01:12:03.352
on the Black Rattler Management
business card we found.

01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:07.723
There can't possibly be two people in
the world who would use that font.

01:12:07.790 --> 01:12:10.193
I mean, look at it!

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:12.261
I still like it.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:14.830
The moral of this story is,

01:12:14.897 --> 01:12:17.400
never use El Kabong.
