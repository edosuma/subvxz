01:10.157 --> 01:13.551
Oh Brett, this is the
happiest day of my life!

01:15.205 --> 01:16.902
Maybe I shouldn't
say that, Bonnie.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.339
Because my wedding day is
supposed to be my happiest day.

01:18.513 --> 01:20.123
Well, you could always say,

"Brett, this is the second
happiest day of my life!"

01:23.170 --> 01:24.258
You're being sarcastic.

You're right, I'm sorry.

Hey, what do you think?

I love it.

I can't believe my little sister
is getting engaged.

01:33.789 --> 01:36.008
Okay, so I'm giving myself
15 minutes

01:36.183 --> 01:37.532
to finish my make up,
and then it takes

01:37.706 --> 01:40.012
about 20 minutes
to get to the restaurant.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.666
Did I say 20?

01:41.840 --> 01:43.538
Maybe I should give it 25
considering traffic.

Did you really need to create
a spreadsheet about Brett

to chance?

01:47.803 --> 01:49.283
Absolutely not.

01:49.457 --> 01:50.675
So, we're going to start
with cocktails and apps,

01:50.848 --> 01:52.329
something light,
and nothing spinachy

01:52.503 --> 01:53.722
because we're going
to be taking pictures.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.723
And then entrees
will also be light,

01:55.898 --> 01:57.334
even though Brett's gonna try to
order the steak and potatoes,

01:57.508 --> 01:59.119

our wine out to the patio.

02:01.425 --> 02:03.035
I've already reserved
the best table.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.907
You know the cocktail tables
next to the fire pit?

02:05.081 --> 02:06.561
And then when I think
Brett's about to propose,

02:06.735 --> 02:08.476
I'll text the videographer
to start rolling

02:08.650 --> 02:09.999
and the rest will be history!

02:10.173 --> 02:12.262
Have you settled
on a way to say yes?

like your chicken?

next time though.

But did you like
the chicken though?

that your next recommendation,

04:08.726 --> 04:11.512
I will eat absolutely anything,
no matter what it is.

04:11.686 --> 04:14.428
Even if I recommended
the goose liver pate?

04:14.602 --> 04:17.039
I will absolutely not eat
the goose liver pate.

04:17.213 --> 04:18.954
But if it's a
twice baked potato,

04:19.128 --> 04:20.869
then I will be
the first in line.

steak and potatoes.

To think that imagine we
grew up in different cities,

have found each other.

The same airplane,
or the same vacation place.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.069
Or a dry cleaner.

football game that day.

-Yeah.

Then I realized I
had no clean clothes

05:12.399 --> 05:14.314

court case the next day.

05:14.488 --> 05:15.706
What was the case?

05:15.880 --> 05:17.578
It was the Little League
suing the city

05:17.752 --> 05:19.231
because they were trying to
pave over their baseball field.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.103
So we could make the argument

05:21.277 --> 05:25.455
that the reason we're together
is because of baseball.

05:25.629 --> 05:28.980

when Brett and I got back
together a few years ago,

10:04.081 --> 10:05.605

10:20.620 --> 10:22.099
What's so strange about that?

10:22.273 --> 10:24.014
Brett and I were the couple
in high school.

Until he took someone else
to prom and you dumped him.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.150
How could you be so sure?

10:29.324 --> 10:31.065
Bonnie, I've known
since I was a teenager

10:31.239 --> 10:32.370
that Brett was the one for me.

What else did you purchase
three years ago?

10:35.722 --> 10:36.897

10:37.071 --> 10:39.116
Don't be silly, just the dress.

10:39.290 --> 10:41.597
I think it's wonderful
to plan for the future,

10:41.771 --> 10:44.078
but I'm finding this
pre-proposal purchase

10:44.252 --> 10:45.557
kind of amazing.

By then, my business
will be ripe for selling,

10:55.437 --> 10:57.308

and launch my own line
of accessories,

to get back together.

-Ava?
-Brett.

11:34.128 --> 11:35.782
What are you doing?

11:35.956 --> 11:36.739
You're not supposed to
see me in my wedding dress.

11:36.913 --> 11:37.697
It'll ruin the surprise!

11:37.871 --> 11:39.915
I know, I'm sorry.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.962
There's something
I have to tell you

11:42.136 --> 11:44.486
and I don't think
that it can wait.

11:46.444 --> 11:47.576
Can we talk in private?

11:47.750 --> 11:49.447
Brett, you're scaring me.

say it in front of both of us.

11:52.668 --> 11:55.236
Ava, first of all,

11:55.410 --> 11:57.238
I think that you're
an amazing woman...

11:57.412 --> 11:59.066
That is a terrible thing to say!

11:59.240 --> 12:01.024
Why?

12:01.198 --> 12:02.156
Because nothing good ever comes
after someone says that to you!

You're not doing this!

12:10.338 --> 12:11.687
Ava, I feel terrible, but--

12:11.861 --> 12:13.210
Is it because I
re-wrote your vows?

12:13.384 --> 12:14.298
Because you can say
whatever you want.

12:14.472 --> 12:15.952
No, it's not.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.519
Is it because I asked you
to wear the tuxedo

12:17.693 --> 12:18.650
with the notch lapel
instead of the wing tip?

12:18.825 --> 12:20.000
It has nothing to do with that.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.479
It's much bigger than that.

12:21.653 --> 12:22.480
You know, I don't want
to hear it.

Here's your ring back.

Get out!

You'd better go, Brett.

the most recent times

14:07.063 --> 14:08.499

21:22.498 --> 21:25.153
Nice. Wow!

21:25.327 --> 21:26.850
That's awesome.

21:27.024 --> 21:28.025
It's fine.

21:28.199 --> 21:31.899
So, look you don't know me.

21:32.073 --> 21:33.204
And I don't know you, Eva.

21:33.379 --> 21:35.206
Ava, with an A.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.296
Great name, that's first rate.

21:37.470 --> 21:38.862
Thanks.

21:39.036 --> 21:40.211
Anyhoo...

21:41.561 --> 21:44.520
Here we are at this
incredible place.

21:44.694 --> 21:49.917
Why not make sure you can keep
the magic going for a lifetime?

21:50.091 --> 21:53.050
Wow, that didn't take long.

21:53.224 --> 21:54.617
Sorry?

21:54.791 --> 21:56.271
Listen Chuck,
you're a really nice guy.

21:56.445 --> 21:58.621
But I'm just here
to have a drink, okay?

21:59.579 --> 22:01.276
Sure, of course!

22:01.450 --> 22:03.887
But I'm thinking about something
a little bit more permanent.

22:04.061 --> 22:05.846
Oh dear...

22:06.020 --> 22:07.935
I'm the kind of guy that likes
to make a woman like you happy.

22:08.109 --> 22:10.024
Chuck...

22:10.198 --> 22:12.896
So I'd like to ask you...

22:13.070 --> 22:13.984
Here we go...

22:14.158 --> 22:15.943
If you've ever considered

22:16.117 --> 22:19.425
buying a time-share condo
here at the resort.

22:19.599 --> 22:21.252
Excuse me?

22:21.427 --> 22:23.951
You obviously look like a woman
who knows what she wants.

22:24.125 --> 22:26.997
And I can get you
into a two bed, two bath

22:27.171 --> 22:29.348
ocean view condo
for pennies on the dollar.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.350
You're trying to sell
me a condo?

22:31.524 --> 22:32.612
[laughing]

22:34.309 --> 22:35.963
Thanks for the drink, Chuck.

22:36.137 --> 22:38.052
You really made my day.

22:40.054 --> 22:41.316
That's a no?

22:45.494 --> 22:47.453
He wanted to sell me a condo!

22:49.193 --> 22:50.107
Oh, ha-ha Bonnie.

22:50.281 --> 22:52.893
Very funny. I'm done.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.460
Come on, after one
bad experience?

22:54.634 --> 22:55.896
Do I have to remind you

22:56.070 --> 22:57.376
I've had two bad
experiences lately?

22:57.550 --> 22:59.813
Okay, you're right. I'm sorry.

22:59.987 --> 23:01.292
Here I am pushing you
to cut loose

23:01.467 --> 23:02.990
when you're still
licking your wounds.

23:03.164 --> 23:05.471
Let's just forget all
about this dating thing

23:05.645 --> 23:07.124
and do something else.

23:07.298 --> 23:09.344
[whistle blows]

23:09.518 --> 23:13.479
Alright, gather around,
all you lovers of romance!

23:13.653 --> 23:15.045
It's time to play a little game

23:15.219 --> 23:19.006
we like to call, "How Well
Do You Know Me?"

23:19.180 --> 23:20.877
We'll ask questions
of each couple

23:21.051 --> 23:23.097
to see how much they
actually know about each other.

23:23.271 --> 23:24.272
Sound like fun?

23:24.446 --> 23:25.099
[cheers]

23:25.273 --> 23:27.318
Wanna stay?

23:27.493 --> 23:28.494
Why not?

23:28.668 --> 23:30.583
Could be good for a few laughs.

23:30.757 --> 23:32.541
Alright, question number one.

23:32.715 --> 23:35.979
What's the favorite song
of your significant other?

23:36.153 --> 23:37.633
Each of you write down
your answer

23:37.807 --> 23:39.287
and then we'll compare.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.289
Maggie May by Rod Stewart.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.334
That was Nick's favorite song.

23:43.509 --> 23:46.033
I don't think Brett had one.

23:46.207 --> 23:48.209
If he did it was from Coldplay,

23:48.383 --> 23:50.167
or was it the Commodores?

23:50.341 --> 23:52.256
Alright second question.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.042
What did your significant other
want to be when they grew up?

23:55.216 --> 23:57.610
Now we're talking
childhood dreams.

23:57.784 --> 23:59.525
Stand-up comedian.

23:59.699 --> 24:01.265
Really?

24:01.440 --> 24:02.832
I cannot picture Nick
on stage telling jokes.

24:03.006 --> 24:04.486
He was terrible at jokes.

24:04.660 --> 24:07.054
And he always forgot
the punch line.

24:07.228 --> 24:09.099
But that's what he wanted to be
when he was a little boy.

24:09.273 --> 24:11.885
I think Brett wanted to be
a famous painter.

24:12.059 --> 24:13.887
Or was it was an architect?

24:14.061 --> 24:15.671
Something like that.

24:15.845 --> 24:17.630
Alright, we've got our third
and final question.

24:17.804 --> 24:20.067
What is the name of
your significant other's

24:20.241 --> 24:22.199
first childhood pet?

24:22.373 --> 24:24.898
Coco, he loved that dog.

24:25.072 --> 24:26.900
He used to keep pictures
of her in his wallet.

24:27.074 --> 24:28.597
I don't think Brett had a dog
growing up.

24:28.771 --> 24:30.425
Sure he did, wasn't his bulldog

24:30.599 --> 24:32.819
the high school mascot
for your football team?

24:32.993 --> 24:34.081
Oh yeah!

24:34.255 --> 24:35.952
God, that thing was homely.

24:36.126 --> 24:37.040
Bruno, I think it was?

24:37.214 --> 24:38.128
Brutus.

24:38.302 --> 24:40.087
Brutus, right.

24:43.264 --> 24:44.613
I know what you're thinking.

24:44.787 --> 24:46.528
I'm not thinking anything.

24:46.702 --> 24:48.922
You think Brett and I didn't
know each other very well.

Ava!

♪

25:01.761 --> 25:03.806
Why did we even get back
together in the first place?

25:03.980 --> 25:04.938
I mean, he dumped me
in high school.

25:05.112 --> 25:06.548
No, you dumped him.

25:06.722 --> 25:08.942
Because he took another girl
to the prom.

25:09.116 --> 25:10.552
And now I feel guilty
because I don't know

25:10.726 --> 25:12.206
if he wanted to be a cowboy,
or an astronaut,

25:12.380 --> 25:14.948
or a secret agent
when he was a boy!

25:15.122 --> 25:16.427
Probably all three
of those things.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.429
But why don't I know?

25:18.604 --> 25:20.997
I spent all of our life trying
to make everything perfect.

25:21.171 --> 25:24.435
The best apartment, the best
table at the best restaurants.

25:26.133 --> 25:27.917
But you know, it
wasn't all my fault.

25:28.091 --> 25:29.136
Nobody said it was.

25:29.310 --> 25:30.964
Brett wasn't perfect either.

25:31.138 --> 25:32.661
He had no sense of timing.

25:32.835 --> 25:34.576
For example, you don't
break up with a woman

25:34.750 --> 25:36.143
when she's trying on
her wedding dress.

25:36.317 --> 25:38.014
It was kind of awkward.

25:38.188 --> 25:39.973
First of all, you don't break up
with someone in public.

25:40.147 --> 25:41.975
You risk making a scene,
and nobody likes that.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.847
Second, he should have at least

25:45.021 --> 25:46.327
planted the seed of the idea

25:46.501 --> 25:47.937
instead of just
dropping it on me.

25:48.111 --> 25:49.591
Third--

25:49.765 --> 25:51.288
Ava, are you really
trying to figure out

25:51.462 --> 25:53.943
how Brett could have
broken up with you better?

25:54.117 --> 25:55.118
My god, I'm doing it again.

25:55.292 --> 25:57.425
You need to slow your roll.

25:57.599 --> 25:59.209
You need to relax a little bit.

25:59.383 --> 26:00.950
How am I supposed to do that
at a place like this?

26:01.124 --> 26:02.909
Oh yeah, because
gorgeous resorts are the worst.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.954
You know what I mean.

26:05.128 --> 26:06.608
Look, I'll tell you what.

26:06.782 --> 26:07.827
Why don't you go find
a spot on the beach?

26:08.001 --> 26:09.524
I'll get us some piña coladas

26:09.698 --> 26:12.048
and we can let the sun
bake our worries away.

on the beach.

Yes, I can tell
by all the flowers

I also have power suits in
neon pink and blinding aqua.

spotted by a satellite, right?

27:34.174 --> 27:35.218

27:38.395 --> 27:40.920
would you be interested

and your friend walking

28:21.395 --> 28:22.875

42:34.203 --> 42:35.857
Nice work.

42:36.031 --> 42:37.946
Do you think we should tell them
we're not a real couple?

42:38.120 --> 42:38.947
I don't think it matters.

42:39.121 --> 42:40.906
Yeah, I guess.

42:41.080 --> 42:44.039
I'm not sure anyone has ever
rounded up this many hearts.

42:44.213 --> 42:47.042
Let's face it, we are legendary!

42:47.216 --> 42:48.478
Here you go.

42:48.653 --> 42:50.524
A keepsake of our
stunning triumph.

42:52.657 --> 42:54.441
And you know what?

42:54.615 --> 42:56.617
Why don't you and your sister
take that couples massage?

42:56.791 --> 42:58.097
Are you sure?

42:58.271 --> 43:00.360
Yeah, I'm not really
a massage guy.

43:00.534 --> 43:04.582
And besides, I have to get over
to the jet ski shop.

43:06.453 --> 43:08.847
Can I call you later?

43:09.021 --> 43:10.849
Yeah, sounds great!

43:11.023 --> 43:12.198
Thanks!

43:23.688 --> 43:25.428
Is this seat taken?

43:27.343 --> 43:28.257
Brett?

43:28.431 --> 43:29.476
Ava!

43:31.521 --> 43:33.349
So, Kyle and Ava, huh?

43:33.523 --> 43:34.960
You heard that, huh?

43:35.134 --> 43:36.439
I sure did.

43:36.614 --> 43:39.268
It was just, you know,
for the contest.

43:39.442 --> 43:40.792
Ah, I see.

43:42.141 --> 43:43.882
What are you doing here?

43:44.056 --> 43:46.188
I can't stop thinking
about you, Ava.

43:47.276 --> 43:50.410
And then I call your phone
and some other guy answers.

43:50.584 --> 43:52.238
I jumped on the
first flight here.

43:52.412 --> 43:55.545
I don't see how what you do
concerns me in any way.

43:55.720 --> 43:57.635
I feel like I owe you
an explanation.

43:57.809 --> 43:59.071
Oh, I'd love to hear that.

43:59.245 --> 44:00.115
Actually, you know what?

44:00.289 --> 44:01.290
Don't bother!

44:01.464 --> 44:02.901
Ava, just let me tell you--

44:03.075 --> 44:05.425
What, so you can
break my heart again?

44:05.599 --> 44:06.818
No thanks.

44:06.992 --> 44:08.733
Here, break this.

44:24.226 --> 44:25.924
You won't believe
what just happened.

44:26.098 --> 44:27.403
You saw Brett downstairs.

44:27.577 --> 44:28.491
Wait, what?
How do you know that?

44:28.666 --> 44:30.145
I saw him in the lobby.

44:30.319 --> 44:31.973
Did you say anything?
Did he say anything?

44:32.147 --> 44:34.236
No, I didn't want
to cause a big scene.

44:34.410 --> 44:36.456
Besides, I'm pretty sure
he's not here to talk to me.

44:36.630 --> 44:38.414
Well, he's not going
to talk to me, either.

44:38.588 --> 44:41.026
Aren't you a little curious
what he has to say?

44:41.200 --> 44:43.071
Yeah, of course I'm curious.

44:43.245 --> 44:44.943
But I don't want to give him
the satisfaction of explaining.

44:45.117 --> 44:47.206
It is so unfair of him
to come here

44:47.380 --> 44:49.251
when I'm working so hard
to get over him.

44:49.425 --> 44:50.644
It's still pretty impressive

44:50.818 --> 44:52.298
that he came all
the way down here.

44:52.472 --> 44:54.909
How do we know he's not
just working on his tan?

44:55.083 --> 44:56.606
You'll figure it out.

44:56.781 --> 44:57.869
Where are you going?

44:58.043 --> 45:01.220
I kind of... have a date.

45:03.135 --> 45:04.397
Shut up!

45:04.571 --> 45:06.225
His name is John,
he's really nice.

45:06.399 --> 45:08.140
We're just going for a
bicycle ride down the strand.

45:08.314 --> 45:10.142
Bonnie, I'm so happy for you!

45:10.316 --> 45:11.665
It's just a bike ride.

45:11.839 --> 45:13.319
Don't say that,
I think it's sweet.

45:13.493 --> 45:15.974
I don't know, I just...

45:16.148 --> 45:17.889
I still feel like Nick's wife.

45:18.063 --> 45:19.281
He would have wanted you
to be happy.

45:19.455 --> 45:21.240
I know.

45:21.414 --> 45:23.982
I'm going to take things slow
and see how it goes.

45:24.156 --> 45:25.461
Well, I think it's wonderful.

45:25.635 --> 45:26.898
How about you?

45:27.072 --> 45:28.377
Are you going to be okay
on your own

45:28.551 --> 45:30.075
knowing Brett is in
the vicinity?

45:30.249 --> 45:31.816
I'll be fine.

45:31.990 --> 45:33.426
Okay, well I'm going to be
back in a few hours.

45:33.600 --> 45:35.341
Why don't you order
room service?

45:35.515 --> 45:37.647
Watch cartoons on TV.

45:49.355 --> 45:52.097
How many guys does it take
to chain one man?

45:53.533 --> 45:54.969
[door knocking]

45:55.143 --> 45:56.318
Room service!

45:56.492 --> 45:57.537
Room service?

45:58.799 --> 46:00.758
I didn't order room service.

46:02.237 --> 46:03.282
[Ava groans]

46:05.414 --> 46:06.546
Surprise.

46:06.720 --> 46:08.200
No, thank you.

46:08.374 --> 46:11.725
Ava, please at least
just take the flowers.

46:16.338 --> 46:18.993
They are beautiful flowers,
thank you.

46:19.167 --> 46:21.561
Now you may go.

46:21.735 --> 46:23.389
I got you some chocolate, too.

46:23.563 --> 46:24.869
Choco-Nutty Buddies?

46:25.043 --> 46:26.392
It's your favorite, right?

46:26.566 --> 46:27.915
Yeah, I suppose.

46:28.089 --> 46:29.351
Ava listen, had I--

46:29.525 --> 46:31.005
Brett, I already told you.

46:31.179 --> 46:32.006
I don't want to hear what you
have to say.

46:32.180 --> 46:33.094
Please.

46:33.268 --> 46:35.009
I made a giant mistake.

46:35.183 --> 46:37.838
I've come all the way here
to tell you how sorry I am.

46:38.012 --> 46:39.579
Well, we can both agree on that.

46:39.753 --> 46:41.929
You are an extremely sorry
excuse for a fiancé.

46:42.103 --> 46:43.757
Yeah.

46:43.931 --> 46:45.541
But would you please just
sit down with me over coffee

46:45.715 --> 46:48.066
and I'll tell you exactly why
I did what I did?

46:48.240 --> 46:50.459
Actually, I have plans.

46:50.633 --> 46:52.070
With Kyle?

46:52.244 --> 46:54.289
Wouldn't you like to know?

47:03.081 --> 47:05.126
♪

47:13.047 --> 47:14.353
It's so gorgeous here.

47:14.527 --> 47:15.876
If you could go anywhere
in the world,

47:16.050 --> 47:17.182
where would you go?

47:17.356 --> 47:19.575
Honest answer?

47:19.749 --> 47:22.056
I'd probably go back
in time a few years.

47:22.230 --> 47:23.362
I hear that.

47:23.536 --> 47:25.886
Life just went by so fast.

47:26.060 --> 47:27.496
Life had other plans.

47:27.670 --> 47:29.368
But I do have other interests.

47:29.542 --> 47:30.891
I like to travel.

47:31.065 --> 47:32.937
And I love to try new foods.

47:33.111 --> 47:35.940
In Canada, I tried
eating jellied moose nose.

47:36.114 --> 47:37.637
Get out!

47:37.811 --> 47:39.900
And in Iceland, I ate
desiccated shark meat.

47:40.074 --> 47:43.121
It's fermented and they
hang it to dry for months.

47:43.295 --> 47:45.253
What did it taste like?

47:45.427 --> 47:48.474
Kind of like jellied moose nose.

47:48.648 --> 47:50.606
I'm not sure I'm that
adventurous.

47:50.780 --> 47:53.087
The hotel restaurant
has Belgian waffles,

47:53.261 --> 47:55.307
French toast and
Yorkshire pudding.

47:55.481 --> 47:57.222
So we could have an
international breakfast

47:57.396 --> 47:58.919
tomorrow if you wanted.

47:59.093 --> 48:00.834
And for dinner we
could have Chicken Kiev

48:01.008 --> 48:05.317
and Chinese noodles and
really cover our bases.

48:05.491 --> 48:07.319
I think I like you a lot.

48:07.493 --> 48:10.017
I like that you like me.

48:10.191 --> 48:12.150
What do you know about that?

48:29.167 --> 48:31.299
Can I get a Mai Tai, please?

48:43.572 --> 48:45.792
Calls this quiet time, huh?

48:48.664 --> 48:49.796
Thanks.

49:17.955 --> 49:19.043
Ava!

49:25.005 --> 49:27.138
[gasping for breath]

49:28.661 --> 49:30.532
You alright?

49:30.706 --> 49:33.144
I must have fallen asleep and
I swallowed a bunch of water.

49:34.014 --> 49:35.059
Here.

49:36.495 --> 49:38.105
[coughing]

49:43.284 --> 49:44.894
Want me to call an ambulance?

49:45.069 --> 49:46.461
No, I don't need an ambulance.

49:46.635 --> 49:47.506
I'm just a little surprised,
that's all.

49:47.680 --> 49:49.856
Ava, what's going on?

49:50.030 --> 49:51.423
Buddy a little space,
she's fine.

49:51.597 --> 49:52.859
It's okay, dude.
Everything's under control.

49:53.033 --> 49:54.339
Yeah, I know. I've got it.

49:54.513 --> 49:55.993
Hey man, she's with me.

49:56.167 --> 49:57.081
Is that right?

49:58.299 --> 49:59.126
Is that right?

49:59.300 --> 50:00.998
This must be Brett.

50:01.172 --> 50:03.783
This just got a lot
more complicated.

50:16.578 --> 50:18.189
Brett saved my life.

50:18.363 --> 50:19.668
He did?

50:19.842 --> 50:23.455
He was so...
I don't know, heroic.

50:23.629 --> 50:25.109
Are you going to talk to him?

50:25.283 --> 50:27.937
Seems like he deserves
at least that much.

50:28.112 --> 50:29.287
I think I'm just
going to sit here

50:29.461 --> 50:30.549
until it's time to go home.

50:30.723 --> 50:32.333
No, you're not.

50:32.507 --> 50:34.466
Maybe it was a mistake
coming here.

50:34.640 --> 50:36.076
But now that you are here,

50:36.250 --> 50:37.904
it's time for you to take
stock of your life

50:38.078 --> 50:39.906
and figure out where you
want to go next.

50:40.080 --> 50:42.213
Which is why I,
as your big sister

50:42.387 --> 50:45.955
have planned us the big sister,
little sister day we never had!

50:46.130 --> 50:48.523
Are you going to let me tag
along on your date with John?

50:48.697 --> 50:50.438
No, even better.

50:50.612 --> 50:53.050
You and I are going
to spend an entire day

50:53.224 --> 50:55.487
gliding into the hedonistic
pleasures of the flesh.

50:56.662 --> 50:58.011
I appreciate the gesture,

50:58.185 --> 50:59.491
but that's kind of
making me nervous.

50:59.665 --> 51:01.145
Nothing crazy,
just a day at the spa!

51:01.319 --> 51:04.583
Mani-pedis, facials,
massage, sauna.

51:04.757 --> 51:06.150
Nothing but pure joy
and leisure.

51:06.324 --> 51:07.977
That actually sounds
kind of wonderful.

51:08.152 --> 51:09.544
Excellent.

51:15.768 --> 51:17.596
This is so lovely.

51:19.380 --> 51:22.079
So, tell me all about
your new boyfriend.

51:22.253 --> 51:25.256
He's not my boyfriend.

51:25.430 --> 51:27.910
Although I'm not opposed
to the idea.

51:28.085 --> 51:31.088
Bonnie, I haven't heard you say
something like that since Nick.

51:31.262 --> 51:33.177
I know.

51:33.351 --> 51:34.526
I'm a little surprised
at how I'm feeling,

51:34.700 --> 51:36.963
but I won't rush things.

51:37.137 --> 51:39.183
I'm just gonna take it slow
and see how it goes.

51:39.357 --> 51:41.141
Well, I can make you
a spreadsheet if you like

51:41.315 --> 51:43.361
and you can weigh all
your options.

51:45.058 --> 51:46.407
I'm kidding.

51:46.581 --> 51:48.409
That might not be a bad idea,
actually.

51:48.583 --> 51:51.195
We're just trying to
avoid another heartbreak.

51:51.369 --> 51:54.285
I've been wondering if
that's really a way to live.

51:54.459 --> 51:56.069
What do you mean?

51:56.243 --> 51:58.245
We're both alone
because of circumstances

51:58.419 --> 52:00.856
beyond our control,
but we're both alive.

52:01.030 --> 52:02.945
We're still breathing, right?

52:03.120 --> 52:05.470
Where there's life,
there's hope.

52:05.644 --> 52:07.863
Well, I'm not too hopeful
about myself,

52:08.037 --> 52:10.997
but you and John
seem like a perfect fit.

52:11.171 --> 52:12.303
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

52:12.477 --> 52:14.392
We just met a few days ago.

52:14.566 --> 52:16.568
I can see it in your eyes.

52:16.742 --> 52:18.222
He's a keeper.

52:19.223 --> 52:21.964
We're not here
to plot my future.

52:22.139 --> 52:25.620
We're here to relax
and release our worries.

52:27.056 --> 52:28.057
You're right.

52:28.232 --> 52:29.972
This is delicious.

52:30.147 --> 52:33.150
What a better way to
spend a day at a resort?

52:36.109 --> 52:39.243
Who's ready for some
heart-pounding action?

52:39.417 --> 52:40.505
[applause]

52:41.114 --> 52:42.246
Okay, here's the contest...

52:42.420 --> 52:43.943
Each of you has a bucket.

52:44.117 --> 52:47.033
You must fill that bucket
with sand from there,

52:47.207 --> 52:48.600
and move it to over here.

52:48.774 --> 52:50.297
Whoever has the
tallest pile of sand

52:50.471 --> 52:54.040
at the end of the contest,
wins the game!

52:54.214 --> 52:55.737
[cheering]

52:55.911 --> 52:58.044
Now what's the grand prize
you may be asking?

52:58.218 --> 53:00.046
It's not much.

53:00.220 --> 53:02.962
Only a dinner and wine tasting
at the private wine cellar.

53:03.136 --> 53:05.965
At the exclusive
and nearly impossible

53:06.139 --> 53:07.706
to get reservations at,

53:07.880 --> 53:10.448
the most romantic resort
on the face of the Earth!

53:22.111 --> 53:23.156
Just so you know...

53:23.330 --> 53:24.810
I'm going to win that contest

53:24.984 --> 53:26.420
and take your ex-fiancé
on a date tonight.

53:26.594 --> 53:27.465
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

53:27.639 --> 53:29.902
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

53:30.076 --> 53:31.556
What I don't get is,
how can a guy

53:31.730 --> 53:33.340
who seems smart enough
to tie his own shoes

53:33.514 --> 53:36.474
be dumb enough to let a woman
like that slip away?

53:36.648 --> 53:37.649
It's complicated.

53:37.823 --> 53:39.477
No it's not, dude.

53:39.651 --> 53:41.348
It's the simplest thing
in the world.

53:41.522 --> 53:43.437
If you ever get the chance
to love someone like that,

53:43.611 --> 53:46.353
you love them like
you'll never let them go.

53:57.146 --> 54:00.889
That masseuse relaxed muscles
I didn't even know I had.

54:01.063 --> 54:03.152
Why can't we live like this
all the time?

54:03.327 --> 54:05.416
I wonder if we could
start a business,

54:05.590 --> 54:08.288
like a day spa kind of thing,
just for women?

54:08.462 --> 54:11.117
To take the stress
off of every day life.

54:12.379 --> 54:14.163
I should start writing notes
about that business.

54:14.338 --> 54:15.904
We could totally
start one, right?

54:16.078 --> 54:17.297
Ava!

54:17.471 --> 54:19.038
What? I can't just
turn my brain off.

54:19.212 --> 54:23.216
Then you haven't reached
maximum relaxation yet.

54:32.051 --> 54:33.400
Decided I'm hungry.

54:33.574 --> 54:34.445
Seriously, dude?

54:34.619 --> 54:35.533
Seriously dude.

54:35.707 --> 54:36.664
Come on, man.

54:36.838 --> 54:38.231
You can't run in the heat

54:38.405 --> 54:39.319
when you've been
drinking all day long.

54:39.493 --> 54:40.320
You don't stand a chance.

54:40.494 --> 54:42.888
We'll see about that.

54:43.062 --> 54:44.542
I'll tell you what,
use some of this.

54:44.716 --> 54:47.022
You're gonna burn
like a well done steak.

54:47.196 --> 54:47.936
Thanks.

54:48.110 --> 54:50.417
[whistle blows]

54:51.244 --> 54:54.421
Alright we've got orange off
to the races right off the bat.

54:54.595 --> 54:55.901
And he's taking a lead here.

54:56.075 --> 54:57.555
Green is in second place.

54:57.729 --> 54:59.339
Yellow over here
is doing well too.

54:59.513 --> 55:01.385
Orange is still winning.

55:07.173 --> 55:09.306
Oh my goodness,
he's just killing it!

55:09.480 --> 55:12.091
He's taking a bit of a break.

55:13.440 --> 55:15.094
No shame in quitting, dude.

55:16.748 --> 55:19.359
Just do it, she's used to it.

55:21.187 --> 55:22.928
I want one of these in my house.

55:23.102 --> 55:25.278
I want one of these
in my bedroom.

55:25.452 --> 55:27.628
Wake up and slide
right into a hot tub.

55:27.802 --> 55:30.022
Don't you think it'd be hard
to be productive?

55:30.196 --> 55:31.589
Who cares about
being productive?

55:31.763 --> 55:34.156
Now we're getting somewhere.

55:37.464 --> 55:38.683
Forget it!

55:42.600 --> 55:46.255
Oh, looks like the shirt
is coming off of these guys!

55:47.648 --> 55:49.041
The shirt is coming off!

55:49.215 --> 55:51.304
Make some noise for him,
you guys!

55:53.480 --> 55:56.614
Oh my goodness,
he's just killing it!

55:59.138 --> 56:00.313
[men bantering]

56:00.487 --> 56:02.359
Oh my goodness, he tripped!

56:02.533 --> 56:04.404
Did you see that?

56:05.753 --> 56:07.886
We should do this once a week
when we go home.

56:08.060 --> 56:09.409
What do you think?

56:09.583 --> 56:11.106
I am all for being pampered,
Bonnie.

56:11.280 --> 56:12.064
But I haven't forgotten
that Brett is still here,

56:12.238 --> 56:13.587
Kyle is still here,

56:13.761 --> 56:15.937
all my personal problems
are still here.

56:16.111 --> 56:17.417
Are you sure Kyle's
the kind of guy

56:17.591 --> 56:18.331
you want to be
spending time with?

56:18.505 --> 56:20.202
What do you mean?

56:20.377 --> 56:22.944
He does live near a resort
with young available women

56:23.118 --> 56:24.511
coming to him on
an hourly basis.

56:24.685 --> 56:27.209
Don't you think
it's entirely possible

56:27.384 --> 56:30.256
that he's wooed a
few of them in his time?

56:33.128 --> 56:35.653
I don't know,
he seems pretty genuine.

56:35.827 --> 56:38.525
He's had a lot of time
to practice that sincerity.

56:38.699 --> 56:40.353
Maybe it's time for me
to throw away

56:40.527 --> 56:42.268
the safe choices in my life.

56:42.442 --> 56:44.879
Maybe it's time for me to be
a little more adventurous.

56:45.053 --> 56:47.273
Throw away the game plan
and the Power Point

56:47.447 --> 56:51.016
and just trust my intuition
for once.

56:51.190 --> 56:52.974
How many glasses of wine
have you had?

56:53.148 --> 56:54.498
I'm not drunk!

56:54.672 --> 56:55.673
I am just tired
of planning so hard

56:55.847 --> 56:57.152
for everything to be perfect,

56:57.326 --> 56:59.851
and for it to all blow up
in my face.

57:00.025 --> 57:01.896
Brett did fly all
the way out here.

57:02.070 --> 57:04.333
Yeah, it was really sweet.

57:04.508 --> 57:06.248
He's still in love with you,
you know.

57:06.423 --> 57:08.903
Well, it's going to take me
a while to trust him again.

57:09.077 --> 57:12.080
He's gonna have to try
pretty hard to convince me.

57:12.254 --> 57:13.430
I really like it.

57:15.040 --> 57:15.997
Perfect!

57:16.694 --> 57:18.173
Is that illegal?

57:19.697 --> 57:21.438
And no referee...

57:21.612 --> 57:23.744
Pink is looking tired.

57:25.050 --> 57:26.051
What's wrong?

57:26.225 --> 57:27.531
You have too many fruity drinks?

57:27.705 --> 57:28.488
-Yeah.
-Why don't you just give up?

57:28.662 --> 57:29.881
Because if you pass out,

57:30.055 --> 57:31.535
they're gonna end
the competition

57:31.709 --> 57:33.232
and I won't get to take Ava
on that date.

57:34.320 --> 57:36.975
These two, there's something
going on with them!

57:37.149 --> 57:39.238
Orange is still leading by far.

57:42.154 --> 57:43.851
Looks like we have a winner--

57:44.025 --> 57:45.723
Oh, hang on a second folks.

57:45.897 --> 57:47.942
We've got a contestant
that just won't quit!

57:48.116 --> 57:50.205
-The contest is over, man.
-I don't think so.

57:50.379 --> 57:52.904
Five... four... three...

57:53.078 --> 57:55.297
Two...one...

57:55.472 --> 57:57.474
We have a winner!

57:58.387 --> 58:00.564
Looks like I have
a reservation to make.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.567
[applause]

58:09.137 --> 58:11.096
I know where I'm
having dinner tonight.

58:21.410 --> 58:22.455
Does that feel better?

58:22.629 --> 58:24.588
Yeah, it does thanks.

58:24.762 --> 58:26.720
Bonnie told me what you did.

58:27.982 --> 58:30.071
Brett, what were you thinking?

58:31.029 --> 58:32.857
I kind of wasn't.

58:33.031 --> 58:33.988
I think I had a few too many
of those little fruity drinks

58:34.162 --> 58:35.512
with the umbrellas in them.

58:35.686 --> 58:38.863
And it was hot
and I got kinda dizzy.

58:39.037 --> 58:42.954
Look, I was just trying to win
that romantic dinner thing

58:43.128 --> 58:46.000
so that you might agree
to go with me.

58:46.174 --> 58:48.133
Then we could talk about
everything that happened.

58:48.307 --> 58:50.831
You didn't have to nearly
kill yourself, Brett.

58:51.005 --> 58:52.616
Yeah, anyway...

58:53.747 --> 58:56.097
I did it.

58:56.271 --> 58:57.272
I won.

58:57.446 --> 58:59.100
You did?

58:59.274 --> 59:01.886
Might've lost a few pounds
of sweat, but I did it.

59:02.060 --> 59:03.322
So will you?

59:03.496 --> 59:05.193
Will you join me
for dinner tonight?

59:05.367 --> 59:06.891
Are you even going to be able
to stand up by tonight?

59:07.065 --> 59:09.546
Oh yeah.

59:09.720 --> 59:12.461
No, I'm good.
I've never been better.

59:12.636 --> 59:14.028
Eight o'clock?

59:14.202 --> 59:15.464
Alright.

59:15.639 --> 59:17.162
I've gotta go.

59:24.604 --> 59:28.042
You know, I saw this ad
for a wine tasting tour.

59:28.216 --> 59:29.522
-Let's go do that.
-Yeah.

59:29.696 --> 59:30.958
That would be so great.

59:31.132 --> 59:32.960
There's a lot of
really good ones around.

59:33.134 --> 59:34.092
Yeah.

59:35.354 --> 59:36.529
I think we should head back
to that farmer's market.

59:36.703 --> 59:38.183
That would be great.

59:38.357 --> 59:39.837
It looked like there
was some beautiful stuff.

59:40.011 --> 59:41.969
I have never seen some
of those vegetables.

59:42.143 --> 59:44.102
They were literally
the size of my head!

59:55.766 --> 59:57.028
Hey.

59:57.202 --> 59:59.030
-There you are.
-Here I am.

59:59.204 --> 1:00:00.858
So I guess you heard
about the contest.

1:00:01.032 --> 1:00:02.294
I'm sorry I missed it.

1:00:02.468 --> 1:00:03.861
I heard it was
very entertaining.

1:00:04.035 --> 1:00:06.385
Yeah, I guess you
could call it that.

1:00:06.559 --> 1:00:08.126
I know, right?

1:00:11.346 --> 1:00:12.434
Looks pretty nice.

1:00:12.609 --> 1:00:14.045
I don't know...

1:00:15.133 --> 1:00:17.004
I'm worried about her.

1:00:17.178 --> 1:00:19.616
Do you think she's
getting in over her head?

1:00:19.790 --> 1:00:21.008
I think for the first time
in her life,

1:00:21.182 --> 1:00:23.576
she is operating
on pure instinct.

1:00:23.750 --> 1:00:26.405
I'm not so sure she knows
how to do that.

1:00:26.579 --> 1:00:28.015
Huh...

1:00:28.189 --> 1:00:31.236
Hey listen, so I've
got this beautiful boat,

1:00:31.410 --> 1:00:33.238
and I'm taking her for a spin
around the islands this weekend.

1:00:33.412 --> 1:00:34.500
Sounds incredible.

1:00:34.674 --> 1:00:35.936
Oh, it's gorgeous out there.

1:00:36.110 --> 1:00:38.591
Like nothing you've
ever experienced.

1:00:38.765 --> 1:00:40.941
A billion stars at night.

1:00:41.115 --> 1:00:43.422
Are you trying to sell me
something again?

1:00:43.596 --> 1:00:45.990
Actually, I'd like you
to come with me.

1:00:46.164 --> 1:00:48.035
Away for the weekend?

1:00:48.209 --> 1:00:49.384
Just the two of us?

1:00:49.558 --> 1:00:50.559
Well, yeah.

1:00:51.517 --> 1:00:53.127
I don't know... we just met.

1:00:53.301 --> 1:00:56.609
I know, but isn't that
what makes it so exciting?

1:00:56.783 --> 1:00:58.611
Getting to know each other
under the stars?

1:00:58.785 --> 1:01:02.136
Letting the cool breeze
whisper in our ears?

1:01:02.310 --> 1:01:04.356
Boy, you're cheesy.

1:01:06.140 --> 1:01:08.577
Don't give me an answer now.

1:01:08.752 --> 1:01:10.362
Just promise me
you'll think about it.

1:01:10.536 --> 1:01:11.493
Yeah.

1:01:11.668 --> 1:01:13.234
Yeah, I'll think about it.

1:01:13.408 --> 1:01:14.932
Great!

1:01:15.106 --> 1:01:16.020
Thanks!

1:01:19.458 --> 1:01:21.329
Looks like it went well.

1:01:22.679 --> 1:01:24.028
Maybe not.

1:01:38.303 --> 1:01:40.131
Waiting for somebody?

1:01:41.393 --> 1:01:43.003
Wow.

1:01:43.177 --> 1:01:44.135
Why thank you.

1:01:44.309 --> 1:01:46.354
You look nice yourself.

1:01:46.528 --> 1:01:48.966
I've got the best seat
in the house.

1:01:49.140 --> 1:01:50.619
It's the only seat in the house.

1:01:50.794 --> 1:01:52.230
That's why it's always booked.

1:01:52.404 --> 1:01:53.361
After you.

1:01:53.535 --> 1:01:54.449
Thanks...

1:01:55.363 --> 1:01:57.322
Here, let me get this for you.

1:02:04.677 --> 1:02:07.854
I couldn't have
chosen better myself.

1:02:08.028 --> 1:02:09.290
Thank you for
having dinner with me.

1:02:09.464 --> 1:02:11.118
Well, you did fly
all the way out here

1:02:11.292 --> 1:02:13.164
and I hear that you
put on quite a show

1:02:13.338 --> 1:02:14.948
at the beach trying
to win this dinner.

1:02:15.122 --> 1:02:17.821
Yeah, I'm a pretty big hit
on social media

1:02:17.995 --> 1:02:20.388
as the "Crazy Beach Dude."

1:02:25.002 --> 1:02:25.785
Thank you.

1:02:29.484 --> 1:02:30.747
Thank you.

1:02:32.618 --> 1:02:34.446
Alright.

1:02:34.620 --> 1:02:37.014
Can we toast to new beginnings?

1:02:37.188 --> 1:02:40.191
Brett, I don't know
if I can make promises

1:02:40.365 --> 1:02:42.497
that I can't keep.

1:02:42.671 --> 1:02:45.022
You know how that is.

1:02:45.196 --> 1:02:47.154
Oh yeah, okay.

1:02:47.328 --> 1:02:48.939
Well come on, you didn't think

1:02:49.113 --> 1:02:50.201
that I was just going
to forget about everything

1:02:50.375 --> 1:02:51.637
that happened between us,
did you?

1:02:51.811 --> 1:02:53.552
No, I know that.

1:02:53.726 --> 1:02:56.294
I'd just like a chance
to explain myself.

1:02:56.468 --> 1:02:57.991
Yeah, all right.

1:02:58.165 --> 1:02:59.776
We're here and I don't
really want to waste

1:02:59.950 --> 1:03:02.256
any more time being angry,
so yes, please explain.

1:03:02.430 --> 1:03:04.345
Okay, thank you.

1:03:06.043 --> 1:03:08.393
You know how you
like making lists, right?

1:03:08.567 --> 1:03:10.221
Like for the wedding?

1:03:10.395 --> 1:03:12.876
And you also make master lists
for your lists?

1:03:13.050 --> 1:03:14.181
It's called an agenda tree.

1:03:14.355 --> 1:03:15.835
Right.

1:03:16.009 --> 1:03:17.445
And it's smart,
it's good, it's helpful

1:03:17.619 --> 1:03:19.143
to make sure that you
get everything done.

1:03:19.317 --> 1:03:20.840
So?

1:03:21.014 --> 1:03:24.061
When I was going through
the wedding guest list,

1:03:24.235 --> 1:03:27.542
I came across this.

1:03:32.069 --> 1:03:34.027
You weren't supposed
to see this.

1:03:34.201 --> 1:03:35.507
I did.

1:03:35.681 --> 1:03:37.596
Well, if you're going
to go snooping--

1:03:37.770 --> 1:03:40.207
It's not snooping,
it was in the wedding folder.

1:03:41.252 --> 1:03:43.515
Ava, it says that we're going
to have two children together.

1:03:43.689 --> 1:03:47.171
A boy and a girl and they're
gonna be named Luke and Katie,

1:03:47.345 --> 1:03:48.476
after our grandparents.

1:03:48.650 --> 1:03:50.174
I was just...

1:03:50.348 --> 1:03:52.219
Just hang on.

1:03:52.393 --> 1:03:54.961
It says that Katie is going to
be in gymnastics at age four.

1:03:55.135 --> 1:03:57.921
At age 8, she's going to do
personal training.

1:03:58.095 --> 1:03:59.313
In high school, she's going
to be fast tracked

1:03:59.487 --> 1:04:00.793
to a scholarship.

1:04:00.967 --> 1:04:02.099
Brett, I was just daydreaming.

1:04:02.273 --> 1:04:04.014
Were you really, though?

1:04:04.188 --> 1:04:06.277
Because Luke was supposed to be
in computer programming early,

1:04:06.451 --> 1:04:07.931
then advanced coding
so he was ready

1:04:08.105 --> 1:04:10.107
for the 21st century technology.

1:04:10.281 --> 1:04:11.978
What's wrong with me
wanting our son

1:04:12.152 --> 1:04:13.197
to be prepared for the world?

1:04:13.371 --> 1:04:15.112
Because he doesn't exist yet!

1:04:16.461 --> 1:04:18.376
Sorry Ava, but I don't know.

1:04:18.550 --> 1:04:21.509
It just felt that
it didn't matter

1:04:21.683 --> 1:04:23.990
how many kids I might want,

1:04:24.164 --> 1:04:26.471
or what I might want
to name them,

1:04:26.645 --> 1:04:28.952
or what school I might
want to send them to.

1:04:29.126 --> 1:04:32.259
It kind of seemed like I didn't
have any choice.

1:04:32.433 --> 1:04:34.871
So instead of talking
to me about this,

1:04:35.045 --> 1:04:36.960
you burst into the change room

1:04:37.134 --> 1:04:38.526
while I'm trying on my
wedding dress

1:04:38.700 --> 1:04:39.919
and announce that you're
breaking up with me.

1:04:40.093 --> 1:04:41.529
Yeah, I said that was a mistake.

1:04:41.703 --> 1:04:42.530
That was the biggest mistake
of my life.

1:04:42.704 --> 1:04:44.271
Yeah, I'll say.

1:04:45.794 --> 1:04:49.189
Thanks for the wine,
I'm really not hungry anymore.

1:04:53.019 --> 1:04:54.542
Ava!

1:04:54.716 --> 1:04:56.457
Here, take this in case
you're cold.

1:04:56.631 --> 1:04:58.024
I'm not cold.

1:04:58.198 --> 1:05:00.897
-Okay.
-Actually, I'm kind of chilly.

1:05:01.071 --> 1:05:02.028
Okay.

1:05:03.029 --> 1:05:04.335
Thank you.

1:05:05.162 --> 1:05:07.077
I understand why you're angry.

1:05:07.251 --> 1:05:08.948
Is that how you're planning
on handling problems

1:05:09.122 --> 1:05:10.558
in our marriage?

1:05:10.732 --> 1:05:11.951
You don't like something,
so you just leave?

1:05:12.125 --> 1:05:13.126
No, of course not!

1:05:13.300 --> 1:05:14.562
How am I supposed to know that?

1:05:14.736 --> 1:05:16.216
I'm going to show you.

1:05:16.390 --> 1:05:18.175
For now, you're gonna
have to trust me.

1:05:18.349 --> 1:05:19.828
I don't know if I
can do that, Brett.

1:05:20.003 --> 1:05:22.005
This is a pretty big deal.

1:05:22.179 --> 1:05:24.529
All our friends, our relatives.

1:05:25.443 --> 1:05:26.531
What a mess...

1:05:28.141 --> 1:05:29.969
What if we just tell everybody
that I'm an international spy

1:05:30.143 --> 1:05:32.885
sent on a secret mission to...

1:05:33.059 --> 1:05:34.931
Yeah, no.

1:05:35.105 --> 1:05:37.977
I should have just told you
the truth right away.

1:05:38.151 --> 1:05:41.024
Yeah well,
speaking of the truth...

1:05:41.198 --> 1:05:45.071
Kyle invited me away on his boat
for the weekend.

1:05:47.334 --> 1:05:48.466
And you said no?

1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:50.120
I said I'd think about it.

1:05:51.077 --> 1:05:52.078
Ava!

1:05:53.645 --> 1:05:56.082
I'm a grown up,
I can make my own decisions.

1:05:56.256 --> 1:05:57.997
If you're trying to make me
jealous, this is working.

1:05:58.171 --> 1:05:59.651
This has nothing to do with you!

1:05:59.825 --> 1:06:01.348
This has everything
to do with me.

1:06:01.522 --> 1:06:02.523
Stop!

1:06:02.697 --> 1:06:04.134
You and me were over.

1:06:04.308 --> 1:06:05.962
And that was your choice.

1:06:06.136 --> 1:06:11.880
Okay, but now I'm here
and I'm saying I made a mistake.

1:06:12.055 --> 1:06:14.318
And I'm trying to
make it up to you.

1:06:14.492 --> 1:06:16.015
I get that you're angry.

1:06:16.189 --> 1:06:18.409
I understand you have
the right to be angry.

1:06:18.583 --> 1:06:21.020
I was angry.

1:06:21.194 --> 1:06:23.544
Now I'm just sad.

1:06:23.718 --> 1:06:26.025
Can't you see that
going away with this guy,

1:06:26.199 --> 1:06:27.984
that's just going
to make it all worse.

1:06:28.158 --> 1:06:29.376
I don't see how that's possible.

1:06:29.550 --> 1:06:30.595
Ava...

1:06:30.769 --> 1:06:31.944
I'm going to bed.

1:06:32.118 --> 1:06:32.901
Here's your--

1:06:33.076 --> 1:06:35.730
Just... keep it.

1:06:44.130 --> 1:06:44.826
Good evening, Ava.

1:06:45.001 --> 1:06:46.045
Hi John.

1:06:46.219 --> 1:06:47.264
Just heading back to my room.

1:06:47.438 --> 1:06:48.787
Bonnie and I had a night cap.

1:06:48.961 --> 1:06:50.571
She's having such a nice time
with you.

1:06:50.745 --> 1:06:52.095
Me too.

1:06:52.269 --> 1:06:53.835
You ever meet someone

1:06:54.010 --> 1:06:55.315
and feel like you've known
them all your life?

1:06:55.489 --> 1:06:57.056
I'll do you one better.

1:06:57.230 --> 1:06:58.492
Have you ever known
someone your whole life

1:06:58.666 --> 1:07:00.755
and felt like you
didn't know them at all?

1:07:00.929 --> 1:07:02.931
A Brett dilemma?

1:07:03.106 --> 1:07:04.890
Exactly.

1:07:05.064 --> 1:07:06.848
Ava, I'm sorry you're having
such a hard time with this.

1:07:07.023 --> 1:07:08.894
That makes the both of us.

1:07:09.068 --> 1:07:09.938
Be patient.

1:07:10.113 --> 1:07:11.375
Things will all work out.

1:07:11.549 --> 1:07:13.159
You really think so?

1:07:13.333 --> 1:07:15.988
I can tell you from recent
personal experience,

1:07:16.162 --> 1:07:17.946
life will give you
its greatest gifts

1:07:18.121 --> 1:07:20.253
in the most unexpected times.

1:07:21.472 --> 1:07:24.127
-Sleep well.
-You too. Goodnight.

1:07:33.745 --> 1:07:36.226
I hear you're going
on a little trip.

1:07:36.400 --> 1:07:38.489
Oh, it's you.

1:07:38.663 --> 1:07:40.360
Look man, I don't want
any trouble.

1:07:40.534 --> 1:07:43.450
I don't want any trouble either,
I just want to talk.

1:07:43.624 --> 1:07:45.626
Alright, what's up?

1:07:47.672 --> 1:07:50.022
No, I'm okay.

1:07:50.196 --> 1:07:52.111
I take it you had a
nice dinner last night.

1:07:52.285 --> 1:07:53.982
I did, it was worth
the struggle.

1:07:54.157 --> 1:07:55.462
Credit where it's due.

1:07:55.636 --> 1:07:56.855
I did not think
you had it in you.

1:07:57.029 --> 1:07:58.509
Yeah, you gotta dig deep right?

1:07:58.683 --> 1:08:00.163
I guess so.

1:08:00.337 --> 1:08:02.817
Look, I guess there
is more to the story,

1:08:02.991 --> 1:08:05.342
but man, I do not
get how you let

1:08:05.516 --> 1:08:07.387
a woman like Ava slip away.

1:08:07.561 --> 1:08:10.129
Yeah, well we were just kids
when we first met.

1:08:10.303 --> 1:08:12.392
The first time that
I ever saw Ava,

1:08:12.566 --> 1:08:14.960
and I'm not just being dramatic,

1:08:15.134 --> 1:08:19.050
when I first laid eyes on her,
I fell in love with her.

1:08:19.225 --> 1:08:21.923
School fair, end of the night,

1:08:22.098 --> 1:08:24.361
everybody's going home,
all the rides are stopped

1:08:24.535 --> 1:08:26.145
and I look over at
one of those booths

1:08:26.318 --> 1:08:28.887
where you throw the
wooden rings on the bottles.

1:08:29.060 --> 1:08:33.021
And there is the
most beautiful girl

1:08:33.196 --> 1:08:35.111
that I have ever seen in my life

1:08:35.285 --> 1:08:40.420
and she's laser focused on
winning a pink stuffed unicorn.

1:08:40.594 --> 1:08:41.987
The guys are trying
to get her to leave.

1:08:42.161 --> 1:08:43.031
She won't go.

1:08:43.206 --> 1:08:44.250
She runs out of money.

1:08:44.424 --> 1:08:45.860
They say, "Take the unicorn."

1:08:46.033 --> 1:08:49.515
She says, "No, I want to
win it fair and square."

1:08:50.778 --> 1:08:52.301
So what's the point
of the story?

1:08:52.476 --> 1:08:53.955
She didn't win a unicorn?

1:08:54.130 --> 1:08:56.001
She came back next year,
she wiped them clean.

1:08:56.175 --> 1:08:59.264
But the point of
the story is that

1:08:59.439 --> 1:09:01.962
she let me walk
her home that night.

1:09:02.138 --> 1:09:05.488
We walked, we talked, two miles.

1:09:05.663 --> 1:09:07.577
We got to know each other.

1:09:07.752 --> 1:09:09.145
I walked her up
to her front porch

1:09:09.318 --> 1:09:12.059
and we had our first kiss.

1:09:12.235 --> 1:09:15.325
That is the most
important day of my life.

1:09:18.066 --> 1:09:19.546
You had it all, man.

1:09:19.719 --> 1:09:20.895
Yeah.

1:09:21.068 --> 1:09:22.201
And then you threw it away.

1:09:22.375 --> 1:09:23.810
Maybe.

1:09:23.985 --> 1:09:26.814
You might want to talk
to Ava about that.

1:09:26.987 --> 1:09:29.861
She and I are going on
a cruise around the island.

1:09:30.035 --> 1:09:31.906
Yeah, but she could
change her mind.

1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:33.865
Not likely.

1:09:34.039 --> 1:09:36.433
Look man, Ava's a grown woman.

1:09:36.607 --> 1:09:38.042
She can make her own decisions.

1:09:38.217 --> 1:09:39.958
Yeah.

1:09:40.131 --> 1:09:42.612
But now you know that she
is the most important person

1:09:42.787 --> 1:09:44.309
in my life.

1:09:44.484 --> 1:09:46.050
So if I find out that you
treated her unfairly,

1:09:46.225 --> 1:09:47.879
you made her feel uncomfortable,

1:09:48.053 --> 1:09:50.925
or you just didn't
give her 100% respect,

1:09:51.099 --> 1:09:54.538
I promise you,
you're gonna regret it, okay?

1:10:41.148 --> 1:10:42.107
Hey Bonnie.

1:10:42.281 --> 1:10:44.022
Brett!

1:10:44.196 --> 1:10:45.937
You look terrible.

1:10:46.111 --> 1:10:47.591
Yeah, I've been up all night.

1:10:47.764 --> 1:10:49.245
Yeah, I can imagine you were.

1:10:49.419 --> 1:10:51.464
I just don't know how
this has happened.

1:10:51.638 --> 1:10:53.987
I don't know how could things
have gone so crazy.

1:10:54.162 --> 1:10:55.903
Not to kick a guy
when he's down,

1:10:56.077 --> 1:10:58.471
but there was that little matter
of you breaking up with Ava.

1:10:58.645 --> 1:11:00.343
Yeah I know,

1:11:00.517 --> 1:11:04.260
but I've tried everything
since to make it right.

1:11:04.434 --> 1:11:07.001
Maybe it's time to move on?

1:11:07.175 --> 1:11:08.481
No, I can't.

1:11:10.440 --> 1:11:11.309
I love her.

1:11:11.484 --> 1:11:13.050
I've always loved her.

1:11:13.225 --> 1:11:16.446
Well Brett, I'm
sure Ava still loves you too.

1:11:16.620 --> 1:11:17.838
Despite everything.

1:11:18.012 --> 1:11:19.710
Really?

1:11:19.884 --> 1:11:21.494
But she's had her heart broken,
that's a big deal.

1:11:21.668 --> 1:11:23.366
I'm still the same guy
that she fell in love with.

1:11:23.540 --> 1:11:25.063
No, you're not.

1:11:25.237 --> 1:11:26.673
You're the Brett that
left Ava at the altar.

1:11:30.721 --> 1:11:32.200
Stop doing that.

1:11:32.375 --> 1:11:34.333
You're gonna give yourself
a panic attack.

1:11:34.507 --> 1:11:35.378
I just don't know what to do.

1:11:35.552 --> 1:11:37.205
Okay, you're a lawyer.

1:11:37.380 --> 1:11:39.425
How would you argue your case
in front of a judge?

1:11:39.599 --> 1:11:41.514
Throw myself at the mercy
of the court.

1:11:41.688 --> 1:11:42.994
That's not going
to work with Ava.

1:11:43.168 --> 1:11:44.603
She's not a big fan
of self pity.

1:11:44.778 --> 1:11:46.040
Well I can't prove
that it's not my fault,

1:11:46.214 --> 1:11:47.693
because it clearly is.

1:11:47.868 --> 1:11:50.567
Isn't there a legal term
for admitting you did

1:11:50.741 --> 1:11:52.525
something wrong and then
trying to make up for it?

1:11:52.699 --> 1:11:53.570
Restitution.

1:11:53.744 --> 1:11:55.398
Something like that.

1:11:55.572 --> 1:11:57.922
I mean, besides saying
you've done something wrong,

1:11:58.096 --> 1:12:00.141
what have you actually done
to try to fix things?

1:12:00.316 --> 1:12:02.056
Apparently not enough.

1:12:02.230 --> 1:12:04.189
Okay, try this.

1:12:04.362 --> 1:12:07.018
-You like football, right?
-Yeah.

1:12:07.192 --> 1:12:09.063
Okay, do you have
a favorite team?

1:12:09.237 --> 1:12:10.151
The Bobcats.

1:12:10.326 --> 1:12:12.110
And do they always win?

1:12:12.284 --> 1:12:13.719
They haven't had a winning
season since I've been a fan.

1:12:13.894 --> 1:12:16.157
Right, and you still want
the best for them.

1:12:16.332 --> 1:12:17.855
You still hope for them to win.

1:12:18.029 --> 1:12:19.117
Yeah.

1:12:19.291 --> 1:12:21.598
Okay, so they're not perfect.

1:12:21.772 --> 1:12:23.425
In fact, often they're terrible.

1:12:23.600 --> 1:12:26.080
But you still hope for the best.

1:12:26.254 --> 1:12:26.994
Right.

1:12:27.168 --> 1:12:29.170
Right, because?

1:12:29.344 --> 1:12:31.999
Well, because every year
they have a new program,

1:12:32.173 --> 1:12:33.610
they bring in new players,

1:12:33.784 --> 1:12:35.263
and I know they're
doing everything possible

1:12:35.438 --> 1:12:36.960
they can to win.

1:12:37.135 --> 1:12:38.963
So are you doing
everything possible to show Ava

1:12:39.137 --> 1:12:41.182
that you're willing to try?

1:12:44.142 --> 1:12:48.929
Brett, I realize your previous
relationship has been shattered.

1:12:49.103 --> 1:12:51.062
Okay, we can't change that.

1:12:51.236 --> 1:12:52.889
But artists create
these beautiful mosaics

1:12:53.064 --> 1:12:55.371
out of little pieces
of broken stone and glass.

1:12:55.545 --> 1:12:57.285
They take something
busted up and useless

1:12:57.460 --> 1:12:59.244
and make beauty.

1:12:59.418 --> 1:13:00.985
So you're saying
that I should take

1:13:01.159 --> 1:13:02.987
what's left of
the old relationship

1:13:03.161 --> 1:13:05.946
and try to make something new?

1:13:06.120 --> 1:13:07.557
Could be...

1:13:09.472 --> 1:13:11.082
Could be!

1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:17.567
Thank you, Bonnie!

1:13:30.449 --> 1:13:32.886
Have you tried
the muffins today?

1:13:33.059 --> 1:13:34.148
They're incredible, aren't they?

1:13:34.322 --> 1:13:35.846
As far as muffins go,

1:13:36.020 --> 1:13:37.282
I'd say they're right up there
with the best.

1:13:37.456 --> 1:13:39.110
What do you think, Ava?

1:13:39.284 --> 1:13:40.546
I'm sorry, what?

1:13:40.719 --> 1:13:42.330
Have you tried
the muffins today?

1:13:42.505 --> 1:13:43.419
No.

1:13:45.029 --> 1:13:47.335
The pastries are good, too.

1:13:47.510 --> 1:13:49.120
I can't make a decision.

1:13:49.294 --> 1:13:51.209
Maybe have one of each.

1:13:51.383 --> 1:13:53.124
That would be wrong Bonnie,
don't you see that?

1:13:53.298 --> 1:13:55.213
It needs to be one or the other.

1:13:55.387 --> 1:13:57.868
You could skip both
and just have eggs benedict.

1:13:58.041 --> 1:13:59.478
That is too many choices, John.

1:13:59.652 --> 1:14:00.958
You know what?

1:14:01.132 --> 1:14:02.350
You don't have
to decide anything.

1:14:02.525 --> 1:14:03.439
About breakfast
or anything else.

1:14:03.612 --> 1:14:06.224
We can just sit here.

1:14:14.450 --> 1:14:15.668
Do you want to talk about it?

1:14:15.842 --> 1:14:17.322
I realize I need to stop
planning my life

1:14:17.496 --> 1:14:18.976
in microscopic detail.

1:14:19.150 --> 1:14:20.107
Sometimes it's hard
to let go of something

1:14:20.281 --> 1:14:21.587
that brings you comfort.

1:14:21.761 --> 1:14:23.894
Exactly! You're a
very wise man, John.

1:14:24.068 --> 1:14:25.416
Which is why I'm thinking
that I'm going to go

1:14:25.591 --> 1:14:27.332
on the boat with Kyle
this weekend.

1:14:27.505 --> 1:14:29.377
Wow talk about going
from zero to a hundred.

1:14:29.552 --> 1:14:31.989
Well, look at you two.
You seem happy.

1:14:32.163 --> 1:14:35.035
You took a chance
and it worked out.

1:14:35.209 --> 1:14:37.429
I think your sister
is pretty special.

1:14:37.603 --> 1:14:40.519
She is and I want to be
more spontaneous like her.

1:14:40.693 --> 1:14:42.216
But going on a trip
with a stranger?

1:14:42.389 --> 1:14:43.957
When Brett came
all the way out here

1:14:44.130 --> 1:14:46.394
to see you and apologize?

1:14:46.568 --> 1:14:48.919
Brett does seem
pretty crazy about you.

1:14:49.093 --> 1:14:50.964
So I shouldn't
go on the boat trip

1:14:51.138 --> 1:14:52.923
with him this weekend?

1:14:53.097 --> 1:14:54.664
No, I mean because of course
doing something spontaneous

1:14:54.838 --> 1:14:56.361
is kind of a gigantic leap
forward for you.

1:14:56.535 --> 1:14:57.928
So I should go away with Kyle?

1:14:58.102 --> 1:14:59.407
I'm not saying that.

1:14:59.582 --> 1:15:01.105
Honey, it's your call.

1:15:01.279 --> 1:15:04.151
I'm gonna go get pancakes
by the pool.

1:15:06.371 --> 1:15:08.155
-Now?
-Now.

First up, I'm going
to write an apology e-mail

to everybody who
was coming to the wedding.

1:15:38.969 --> 1:15:41.275
I'm going to let them know
that it was me being stupid.

1:15:41.449 --> 1:15:42.450
Brett, you don't
have to do that.

1:15:42.625 --> 1:15:43.713
Yes, I do.

1:15:45.148 --> 1:15:46.977
They're probably
wondering what's happened,

1:15:47.151 --> 1:15:50.327
and I want them to know that
it had nothing to do with you.

1:15:50.502 --> 1:15:52.460
Next, I'm signing up
for an online course

1:15:52.635 --> 1:15:55.463
to improve my
communication skills.

1:15:55.638 --> 1:15:57.291
Brett!

1:15:57.465 --> 1:15:59.990
Yeah, well let's be honest.

1:16:00.164 --> 1:16:02.862
It was a really stupid thing
to call off the wedding.

1:16:03.036 --> 1:16:06.518
If I had just come to you
with my concerns,

1:16:06.692 --> 1:16:09.434
we'd be married right now.

1:16:09.608 --> 1:16:14.395
Instead of in this mess
of emotions that I created.

Well that's very sweet.

1:16:16.223 --> 1:16:17.921
I really appreciate it.

for the weekend

with Mr. Muscle Head,

1:16:28.148 --> 1:16:32.500
but I just want you to know
that whatever you do decide,

1:16:32.675 --> 1:16:34.023
I'll be here.

1:16:35.721 --> 1:16:41.031
And I won't obsess over it
or ask you a million questions.

I'm just gonna be grateful
that you came back.

You're really something,
you know that?

1:16:48.778 --> 1:16:51.911
If that something is what
made you fall in love with me,

1:16:52.085 --> 1:16:55.262
or if that something makes
you want to be with me again,

1:16:55.436 --> 1:17:00.528
then that's something
that I'm gonna try to find.

1:17:00.702 --> 1:17:02.400
I'm confusing myself.

1:17:03.967 --> 1:17:05.532
I'm not.

1:17:05.708 --> 1:17:08.014
I totally understood
what you're trying to say.

1:17:08.188 --> 1:17:10.321
And that makes you
pretty something, too.

1:17:13.063 --> 1:17:14.107
Gotta go.

you decide, I'll be here.

If you're not going,
then why are you packing?

I think you've been spending
too much time in the sun.

It's just that I figured out
something very important.

1:17:40.699 --> 1:17:42.222
Which is?

1:17:42.396 --> 1:17:43.920
You can't think your way
through a relationship.

1:17:44.094 --> 1:17:45.008
You have to feel
your way through.

1:17:45.182 --> 1:17:46.966
I don't disagree.

1:17:47.139 --> 1:17:49.490
The best anyone can do is be
fearless and try new things.

See if it's a good fit.

It's just that you know,
the list that Brett saw,

1:17:58.369 --> 1:18:00.545
I was only kind of daydreaming
about what life could be.

1:18:00.719 --> 1:18:02.895
Not what it absolutely
had to be.

1:18:03.068 --> 1:18:04.375
But I can totally understand

1:18:04.549 --> 1:18:05.768

1:24:29.716 --> 1:24:30.978
What do you want?

1:24:31.153 --> 1:24:33.155
What I want is...

1:24:35.505 --> 1:24:37.028
Yeah?

1:24:37.202 --> 1:24:39.161
I want to marry you.

1:24:40.987 --> 1:24:41.989
Really?

1:24:42.164 --> 1:24:43.513
Well, hang on a second.

1:24:43.687 --> 1:24:45.297
I don't remember you
proposing to me.

1:24:46.994 --> 1:24:48.300
I thought we were engaged?

1:24:48.474 --> 1:24:50.650
Right, but that
circle is closed.

1:24:52.043 --> 1:24:55.090
If we're going to do this,
we're going to do it right.

1:24:56.526 --> 1:24:58.049
Come on, Ava.

1:24:58.223 --> 1:25:01.531
You know how I am
at public displays.

1:25:01.705 --> 1:25:05.100
Oh, you can do it.

1:25:17.199 --> 1:25:22.813
Ava, will you make me the
happiest man in the world?

1:25:22.987 --> 1:25:24.075
Again?

1:25:24.249 --> 1:25:25.903
What is he doing?

1:25:26.077 --> 1:25:27.948
I think he's trying to propose.

1:25:28.123 --> 1:25:29.907
But he doesn't look
very sincere.

1:25:30.081 --> 1:25:31.474
Come on, man.

1:25:31.648 --> 1:25:33.998
Let's give him another chance.

1:25:34.172 --> 1:25:36.434
Ava, you're the love of my life.

1:25:36.609 --> 1:25:38.089
Ever since high school,

1:25:38.263 --> 1:25:41.092
we knew that we were
meant to be together.

1:25:41.266 --> 1:25:45.183
I don't want to have another day
without you in my life.

1:25:45.357 --> 1:25:47.054
Will you marry me?

1:25:51.058 --> 1:25:52.407
Yes, Brett.

1:25:55.193 --> 1:25:57.587
[applause]

1:26:10.121 --> 1:26:12.123
Where should we go
for our honeymoon?

1:26:13.080 --> 1:26:14.081
Surprise me.

1:26:14.255 --> 1:26:15.822
Fall foliage tour?

1:26:15.996 --> 1:26:17.172
No.
