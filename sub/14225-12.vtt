WEBVTT

00:06.256 --> 00:07.256
(SNORING)

00:12.588 --> 00:14.955
(SNICKERING)

00:14.990 --> 00:17.774
Oh. Shaving cream? Jorge!

00:17.809 --> 00:18.809
(SNORING)

00:20.429 --> 00:21.661
Hey, buddy!

00:21.697 --> 00:23.705
(SHRIEKS)

00:23.741 --> 00:25.557
(LAUGHS) Luke?

00:25.593 --> 00:27.317
What are you doing here?

00:27.352 --> 00:28.643
And will I have to lie

00:28.679 --> 00:30.759
to the police about anything?

00:30.881 --> 00:33.915
No, I came to bring you
a present.

00:33.951 --> 00:36.175
My summer school homework.
(CHUCKLES)

00:36.211 --> 00:38.611
That was due last Friday, so
finish shaving, and get started.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.638
Shaving cream
while you're sleeping?

00:40.674 --> 00:43.141
Classic!

00:43.176 --> 00:46.027
(LAUGHS) Yeah. I call it
the "Sleeping Santa."

00:46.062 --> 00:49.142
(LAUGHS DRYLY) I call it, "Not
Funny the First Ten Times."

00:50.025 --> 00:52.134
You must be Luke.

00:52.136 --> 00:55.262
Is it true you put fake puke
in Ravi's lunch box,

00:55.297 --> 00:57.989
so he hurled on the lunch lady?

00:58.024 --> 00:59.716
Nah, that story isn't true.

00:59.751 --> 01:01.593
Oh.

01:01.628 --> 01:03.328
I didn't use fake puke.
I used real puke.

01:03.364 --> 01:04.321
I'm a prank purist.

01:04.356 --> 01:05.556
(CHUCKLES)

01:05.591 --> 01:06.715
That was real?

01:06.750 --> 01:07.750
(GAGS)

01:10.446 --> 01:12.579
Dude, can I be your intern?

01:12.614 --> 01:14.764
Sorry, I work alone.

01:14.800 --> 01:18.120
No evidence, no
witnesses, no jail time.

01:20.464 --> 01:22.322
<i>¶ Here we go</i>

01:22.357 --> 01:25.183
<i>¶ We're leaving the city
behind right now</i>

01:25.218 --> 01:27.069
<i>¶ Let's gather by
the campfire light</i>

01:27.104 --> 01:28.929
<i>¶ And sing this song</i>

01:28.964 --> 01:32.140
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka</i>

01:32.176 --> 01:34.626
<i>¶ Hanging out with someone new</i>

01:34.661 --> 01:37.395
<i>¶ Then falling out
of a camp canoe</i>

01:37.431 --> 01:39.356
<i>¶ What's that smell?
It's on your shoe</i>

01:39.391 --> 01:40.757
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka</i>

01:42.186 --> 01:44.569
<i>¶ Got a s'more in my hair</i>

01:44.605 --> 01:47.171

02:00.153 --> 02:02.704
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka</i>

02:02.739 --> 02:04.864

02:04.900 --> 02:07.909
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka ¶</i>

02:16.403 --> 02:18.278
Well, since Ravi's
doing my homework,

02:18.313 --> 02:19.638
and I have some time,
let's go hit the lake!

02:19.673 --> 02:21.865
It's not so much a lake,

02:21.900 --> 02:23.420
as runoff
from a fracking operation.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.645
Hey, Emma.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.998
Oh, that's my boyfriend.
Please don't embarrass me.

02:30.033 --> 02:31.975
Xander, this is
my brother, Luke.

02:32.010 --> 02:33.352
Hey, man. Great to meet you.
You, too.

02:33.387 --> 02:36.062
Did you know my sister snorts
when you tickle her on the elbow?

02:36.098 --> 02:37.205
(SCOFFS) I do not snort.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.240
(LAUGHS AND SNORTS)

02:40.218 --> 02:41.701
Do you guys hear snorting?

02:41.737 --> 02:43.511
Bartholomew?

02:43.546 --> 02:45.186
Did my little piggy
come to visit?

02:45.866 --> 02:48.249
No, the only pig
in here is Emma.

02:48.284 --> 02:49.404
Oh, that came out wrong.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.581
I don't know you.
Identify yourself!

02:54.616 --> 02:55.924
This is Luke.

02:55.959 --> 02:57.725
He's our cool brother.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.419
What? Oh, tell me I'm wrong.

03:01.940 --> 03:05.258
So, you're Blondie
McPerfect-Pants' brother?

03:05.294 --> 03:06.735
(SCOFFS)
Emma's not perfect. See?

03:06.770 --> 03:08.019
(LAUGHS AND SNORTS)

03:08.054 --> 03:09.721
Ha! That's hilarious!

03:09.756 --> 03:10.756
(ALL LAUGHING)

03:12.634 --> 03:13.714
No, it's not!

03:19.825 --> 03:20.825
(BLOWS RASPBERRY) Ha! Oh.

03:21.518 --> 03:23.226
Ugh.

03:23.261 --> 03:26.129
Spiderwebs taste terrible.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.998
That is because they are
comprised of proteinaceous silk

03:28.033 --> 03:29.593
extruded from
the arachnid's spinneret.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.036
What Professor
Blabs-a-lot is saying

03:33.071 --> 03:34.012
is that the webs
come out of their butts.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.047
(CHUCKLES)

03:35.073 --> 03:36.564
Hmm.

03:36.599 --> 03:38.119
I wonder if I could... No!

03:39.503 --> 03:41.411
(CHUCKLING)

03:41.446 --> 03:43.288
(SIGHS)

03:43.323 --> 03:45.348
Luke, I am happy
you are visiting,

03:45.383 --> 03:47.667
but I am Jorge's CIT.

03:47.703 --> 03:49.410
So I would appreciate it
if you would show me

03:49.446 --> 03:50.561
a little respect.

03:50.597 --> 03:54.916
Okay. But no one's ever gotten
respect by asking for it.

03:54.951 --> 03:56.551
Or by tucking
a T-shirt into shorts.

04:02.917 --> 04:05.610
Huh. Pretty cool.
(EXCLAIMS) Yes.

04:05.645 --> 04:09.005
Un-tucking my shirt does give
me a rather edgy bad-boy vibe.

04:10.901 --> 04:12.901
I was talking about The Spot.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.378
This is the place where Xander

04:15.413 --> 04:16.653
takes your sister to...

04:17.524 --> 04:18.724
Chat.

04:21.711 --> 04:24.029
Hey, look who's here.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.264
The lame-os from
Camp Pee-Pee-Kaka.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.556
You should've seen him before
he un-tucked the shirt.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.754
Get lost.

04:32.789 --> 04:34.856
Um...

04:34.933 --> 04:36.893
Actually, I believe it is
our turn at The Spot.

04:37.569 --> 04:38.876
Says who?

04:38.912 --> 04:39.912
The sign-up sheet.

04:41.973 --> 04:42.973
See?

04:46.344 --> 04:48.103
Not only was that disrespectful,

04:48.138 --> 04:49.498
but that was my
zero-gravity pen.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.367
Ravi, let me handle this.

04:54.402 --> 04:55.643
You don't have
a good history with bullies.

04:55.679 --> 04:58.671
What do you mean?

04:58.707 --> 04:59.748
Last year, I stood up to that
barbarian who stole my lunch money.

04:59.783 --> 05:00.783
She was nine.

05:03.703 --> 05:05.003
Don't worry, I'll take
care of this guy.

05:05.039 --> 05:06.029
Just like I did when I got your

05:06.064 --> 05:07.630
lunch money back from Becky.

05:07.665 --> 05:09.785
Okay, she was unusually
large for a nine-year-old.

05:11.211 --> 05:15.630
And I do not need you to fight
my battles for me anymore.

05:15.666 --> 05:18.175
Maybe you should let
Luke fight this battle.

05:18.210 --> 05:20.910
Because this one
has facial hair.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.346
You see that 'stache
comin' in, right?

05:23.815 --> 05:26.141
Well, I am not afraid of you,

05:26.176 --> 05:27.584
or that dirt on your lip.

05:27.619 --> 05:28.859
BOTH: Ooh.

05:30.238 --> 05:31.988
What did you just say to me?

05:32.024 --> 05:33.723
We are done sharing The Spot.

05:33.759 --> 05:35.083
So if you want it,

05:35.118 --> 05:36.660
you will have to fight for it.

05:36.695 --> 05:39.120
Works for me.

05:39.155 --> 05:41.639
I hope you guys
have good dental coverage.

05:41.675 --> 05:42.824
And if you don't,
my dad's a dentist,

05:42.859 --> 05:44.019
and he needs the business.

05:45.954 --> 05:46.994
(CHUCKLING) Okay. Whoa.

05:50.091 --> 05:52.617
Hey, by fight, I did not mean

05:52.652 --> 05:55.779
bare-knuckle brawling
like savages!

05:55.814 --> 05:58.814
Uh, uh, I was thinking of a
single-elimination Sudoku tournament.

06:00.402 --> 06:02.210
He doesn't seem like
a big fan of brain teasers.

06:02.245 --> 06:04.285
(CHUCKLES) Why do you think
I suggested it?

06:04.848 --> 06:07.306
You know what?

06:07.342 --> 06:11.094
I say we have a camp versus
camp archery battle!

06:11.129 --> 06:13.571
Done. And the victor
gets The Spot

06:14.557 --> 06:17.192
forever!

06:17.227 --> 06:19.427
Do you think you are man enough?

06:19.871 --> 06:23.023
Oh, I'm more than man enough.

06:23.058 --> 06:25.058
And I have the Bar Mitzvah
video to prove it.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.845
It is on!

06:28.880 --> 06:30.120
Oh, and <i>mazel tov.</i>

06:33.769 --> 06:35.729
That was the weirdest
challenge I've ever seen.

06:41.893 --> 06:44.202
You challenged Eric
and Camp Champion

06:44.238 --> 06:45.953
to a battle for The Spot?
(CHUCKLES)

06:45.989 --> 06:48.974
Yes, I looked him
right in the chest

06:49.009 --> 06:50.169
and demanded some respect.

06:52.237 --> 06:54.478
Ravi, Camp Champion
is a sports camp.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.898
Their motto is,
"Win or sleep in the lake."

06:56.933 --> 06:57.933
Fracking runoff.

06:59.786 --> 07:01.695
We'll never beat them.

07:01.730 --> 07:04.122
I hate those
Camp Champion jerks.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.423
Last year, they snuck
into the kitchen,

07:05.458 --> 07:06.975
and put mud in our meatloaf.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.051
How could you tell?

07:08.086 --> 07:09.311
It had more worms than usual.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.771
And it tasted better.

07:11.807 --> 07:15.075
Speaking of worms,
Eric's the worst.

07:15.110 --> 07:17.051
Tell me about it.
I'm sorry I ever dated him.

07:17.087 --> 07:18.327
You and me both, sister.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.390
BOTH: You dated Eric?

07:22.033 --> 07:23.224
Awkward!

07:25.812 --> 07:27.378
If these guys are all
super athletes,

07:27.413 --> 07:29.096
how are we supposed
to beat them?

07:29.132 --> 07:31.374
Well, I'm pretty good
with a bow and arrow.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.501
Remember that time I shot an apple
off Ravi's head? (LAUGHTER)

07:33.537 --> 07:35.236
It was a pimple,
and it was on my nose.

07:37.432 --> 07:39.624
Either way, that must've
been a great shot.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.242
So, Luke, could you give us some pointers?
Yeah, sure.

07:41.278 --> 07:42.836
(CHUCKLES) We do not need Luke

07:42.871 --> 07:45.321
and his pimple-popping prowess.

07:45.357 --> 07:48.199
I will devise us a
brilliant battle strategy

07:48.235 --> 07:50.769
based on Wellington's defeat
of Napoleon at Waterloo.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.120
What happened was...

07:52.155 --> 07:53.771
Or we could just
kick their butts.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.807
I say we go with Luke's plan.

07:55.842 --> 07:56.749
But I did not get to finish.

07:56.784 --> 07:57.784
Exactly.

08:08.046 --> 08:09.487
And that's how it's done, son.
(CHUCKLES)

08:09.522 --> 08:12.382
Dude, that was awesome!

08:12.417 --> 08:14.926
Actually, I myself
am quite the toxophilite.

08:14.961 --> 08:16.161
I thought you were American.

08:18.156 --> 08:22.075
A toxophilite
is an archery aficionado.

08:22.110 --> 08:25.987
Look, Ravi, you may be
a taco flashlight,

08:26.022 --> 08:27.730
but archery involves some things
that you're not very good at,

08:27.765 --> 08:29.924
like strength, coordination,

08:29.960 --> 08:31.000
not falling.

08:32.329 --> 08:33.887
I will have you know,
this summer

08:33.922 --> 08:35.088
I've become quite
physically capable.

08:35.123 --> 08:37.340
Really? Yes.

08:37.375 --> 08:40.918
I am captain of the Camp
Kikiwaka Trampoline Team.

08:40.953 --> 08:43.953
Are you the only member of the
Camp Kikiwaka Trampoline Team?

08:44.115 --> 08:46.332
Perhaps.

08:46.367 --> 08:49.027
The point is,
I'm a serious athlete.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.962
I even have my own pair

08:50.997 --> 08:52.317
of professional grade
tramp socks.

08:52.849 --> 08:54.441
I'm...

08:54.476 --> 08:55.676
Proud of you?

08:57.871 --> 08:59.295
And you will be even prouder

08:59.331 --> 09:01.080
when I help us defeat
Camp Champion.

09:01.116 --> 09:02.156
Watch this.

09:06.129 --> 09:09.089
(LAUGHING)

09:09.165 --> 09:12.801
Well, I don't know about
defeating Camp Champion,

09:12.836 --> 09:15.156
but you sure ruined
that snail's day.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.816
I still can't believe
you dated Eric.

09:20.852 --> 09:23.194
Why don't you just take
my leftovers at lunch?

09:23.230 --> 09:25.446
Eric and I started
dating on July 4th.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.515
But I started
dating Eric on July 4th.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.104
I guess Eric got
his share of fireworks.

09:41.239 --> 09:43.839
We can't lose The Spot.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.542
Otherwise, where will we
go to... chat?

09:46.577 --> 09:49.454
Yeah, I loved... chatting there.

09:51.482 --> 09:52.498
Mmm-hmm.

09:55.912 --> 09:59.196
Anyway, can you pass me
another arrow, hog-chuckler?

09:59.232 --> 10:00.590
Zuri, that's rude.

10:00.625 --> 10:02.976
Oh. I'm sorry.

10:03.053 --> 10:05.637
Can you please pass me
another arrow, hog-chuckler?

10:07.632 --> 10:09.632
Zuri, let's not re-snort to
name calling.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.760
I mean...

10:11.795 --> 10:13.085
You have to be
the pigger person.

10:13.121 --> 10:16.264
Uh, um, I mean...

10:16.299 --> 10:17.539
Don't you just hate Eric?

10:19.102 --> 10:21.144
Among others. (CHUCKLES)

10:21.179 --> 10:22.945
Fine. How about I tell you

10:22.981 --> 10:24.147
something embarrassing about me?

10:24.182 --> 10:25.490
Oh, this is getting good.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.571
Okay, Emma, I've never
told anyone this, but...

10:31.364 --> 10:32.780
I have a fake pinky toe.

10:32.815 --> 10:33.948
(LAUGHS)

10:33.983 --> 10:34.983
Freak!

10:35.827 --> 10:36.827
Sorry, go on.

10:38.754 --> 10:40.513
If you're missing a toe,

10:40.548 --> 10:42.965
then how do you play
This Little Piggy?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.720
Nobody ever goes "Wee-wee-wee
all the way home."

10:46.596 --> 10:49.013
On the bright side,
your other piggies

10:49.048 --> 10:51.128
can still go to market
to get roast beef.

10:52.260 --> 10:53.260
I'm not helping.

10:59.993 --> 11:03.719
Well, if it isn't the dorks
of Camp Dweeby-Waka.

11:03.755 --> 11:05.679
You must be Eric.

11:05.715 --> 11:07.114
How did you know?

11:07.150 --> 11:08.990
You have a very punch-able face.

11:10.553 --> 11:14.805
So, do you like how we
redecorated The Spot?

11:14.841 --> 11:17.884
Hey, you ruined a perfectly
good beat-up truck!

11:17.961 --> 11:19.761
And that color does not
match the rust at all.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.305
You know, Emma,

11:22.340 --> 11:24.380
you and Eric kind of look alike.

11:24.584 --> 11:25.584
BOTH: We do not.

11:27.762 --> 11:29.762
Again, I say, punch-able face.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.066
Hey, Xan-dork,

11:33.101 --> 11:35.309
I'm going to make you
cry like a baby,

11:35.345 --> 11:37.220
just like the first time we met.

11:37.255 --> 11:39.536
You ran me over with a Jet Ski!

11:40.784 --> 11:42.824
It's not my fault your head
looks like a buoy.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.418
So, where's the dweeb
who started all this?

11:50.810 --> 11:52.284
Sorry we're late.
Ravi's carrying the water,

11:52.320 --> 11:53.320
and I had to carry him.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.386
These are two-liter bottles!

11:59.026 --> 12:00.518
Loser.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.919
(CHUCKLES)

12:01.955 --> 12:04.138
You will be the losers.

12:04.173 --> 12:06.006
My well-hydrated team

12:06.042 --> 12:09.160
will vanquish you ignominiously.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.436
I can't hear you.

12:10.472 --> 12:11.472
I'm up here.

12:14.033 --> 12:17.343
I think Eric has
gotten even taller.

12:17.378 --> 12:18.858
And his ears have gotten bigger.

12:19.939 --> 12:20.939
What? I'm an ear girl.

12:23.827 --> 12:26.377
So, Eric, there's only
three of you?

12:26.413 --> 12:27.453
We're going to kick your...

12:27.488 --> 12:29.555
Incredibly cute butt.

12:29.590 --> 12:30.323
That is not what
I was going to say.

12:30.358 --> 12:33.300
Yeah, you're going to be
picking arrows out of your...

12:33.336 --> 12:34.719
Beautiful, pearly white teeth.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.295
(GIGGLES)

12:36.330 --> 12:37.705
Way to move on, girls.

12:39.734 --> 12:40.854
All right, Camp Kikiwaka.

12:45.657 --> 12:47.774
This is the day
that Camp Champion

12:47.809 --> 12:49.350
becomes Camp Loser!

12:49.385 --> 12:51.519
Uh, Xander, maybe... Not now.

12:51.554 --> 12:54.464
Today we win The Spot
not just for a day,

12:54.499 --> 12:57.241
not just for a week,
but forever!

12:57.277 --> 12:59.517
Uh, Xander... I know,
it's a great speech.

12:59.955 --> 13:01.287
So raise your bows

13:01.322 --> 13:03.213
and prepare to win!

13:03.249 --> 13:04.249
Or lose.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.145
But the battle isn't
supposed to start till 2:00.

13:09.180 --> 13:10.238
Guess your watch is slow.

13:10.273 --> 13:13.174
Fire! Run!

13:13.209 --> 13:14.659
(GROANS) Ravi, go!

13:14.694 --> 13:17.211
I'll cover you!

13:17.246 --> 13:19.166
(GRUNTS AND GROANS)
(ARROWS THUDDING)

13:20.524 --> 13:22.216
Whoa!

13:22.251 --> 13:23.909
Okay, enough covering!

13:23.944 --> 13:25.503
Help!

13:25.538 --> 13:27.672
(ALL YELLING)

13:33.922 --> 13:36.772
(ALL SCREAMING)

13:36.807 --> 13:39.683
Well, that went well.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.410
We are getting slaughtered worse

13:41.446 --> 13:44.371
than the Massacre of
Thessalonica in 390 AD!

13:44.407 --> 13:45.807
Can't you just say,
"They're kicking our butts"?

13:45.842 --> 13:48.175
I thought it was implied!

13:48.211 --> 13:49.411
Oh, water?

13:51.264 --> 13:53.024
They're coming!
Take up defensive positions!

13:54.651 --> 13:56.284
(ALL SCREAMING)

14:13.678 --> 14:15.678
I get it, I get it, I'm out!

14:16.330 --> 14:17.330
Jerk!

14:21.394 --> 14:23.519
This does not look good.

14:23.554 --> 14:25.780
I can't believe we might lose The Spot!
We won't!

14:25.857 --> 14:29.867
I did not wear tacky Velcro
all day just to lose.

14:29.903 --> 14:35.089
We would have won by now if you had
let me light these arrows on fire!

14:35.124 --> 14:36.999
Speaking of arrows, we're running out!
What do we do?

14:37.035 --> 14:38.709
I don't toe!

14:38.744 --> 14:39.911
Did you just say "toe"?

14:39.946 --> 14:42.279
No!

14:42.314 --> 14:44.290
Now, let's keep firing, otherwise
we're going to be dead feet!

14:44.325 --> 14:45.325
I mean, meat!

14:46.311 --> 14:47.410
You did it again!

14:47.445 --> 14:49.153
Not on purpose!

14:49.188 --> 14:51.264
Meanwhile, you laughed
at my snort!

14:51.299 --> 14:53.415
So you both found out
you're not perfect.

14:53.450 --> 14:55.126
Boo-hoo!

14:55.161 --> 14:56.321
Welcome to the real world!

15:00.241 --> 15:03.175
Great. And now, I'm out

15:03.211 --> 15:06.162
of this game, and this
stupid conversation.

15:06.197 --> 15:09.006
Emma, you may snort,

15:09.041 --> 15:11.501
but it's the cutest snort
I have ever heard.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.127
Aww. Thanks, Xander.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.812
And you are awesome

15:14.848 --> 15:16.568
from your head to
where your toe should be.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.524
(GASPS) Oh.

15:18.559 --> 15:20.125
I'm hit. I'm going
into the light.

15:20.161 --> 15:21.161
Hi, Grandma.

15:23.314 --> 15:25.147
(GASPS) You're both out!

15:25.182 --> 15:27.549
By the way, I heard
what you said,

15:27.585 --> 15:29.544
and you two imperfect weirdos
deserve each other. (CHUCKLES)

15:29.579 --> 15:31.370
I wouldn't talk.

15:31.406 --> 15:33.180
Emma's got a thicker
mustache than you do.

15:33.216 --> 15:34.448
(BOTH GASP)

15:34.484 --> 15:35.644
BOTH: You're mean.

15:38.755 --> 15:41.780
Freeze, you brown-eyed Adonis!

15:41.816 --> 15:43.656
And I just can't help myself.

15:44.143 --> 15:46.844
I know, he's so dreamy.

15:46.879 --> 15:49.855
I wrote my number on this arrow.

15:49.890 --> 15:51.490
Wait, are you trying to
get back together

15:51.525 --> 15:52.867
with my ex-boyfriend?

15:52.902 --> 15:54.936
He's my ex-boyfriend,

15:54.971 --> 15:56.354
so I can date him if I want to!

15:56.389 --> 15:57.896
Guys, not so loud.

15:57.932 --> 16:00.741
I'm dating that cute counselor
from the Bunny Cabin.

16:00.777 --> 16:02.042
Well, she's about to be single.

16:02.078 --> 16:03.118
Very single!

16:07.867 --> 16:08.947
That was easy.

16:12.063 --> 16:13.696
(SIGHS)

16:13.731 --> 16:15.448
That did not go as planned.

16:15.483 --> 16:17.243
If anyone asks,
we were ambushed.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.256
Well, Ravi, if there's just
going to be two of us left,

16:23.291 --> 16:24.623
I'm glad it's you and me.

16:24.658 --> 16:25.874
Thank you, brother.
That means a lot.

16:25.909 --> 16:27.069
Because I'm really thirsty.

16:29.881 --> 16:33.415
Luke, I have more to offer
our team than just water.

16:33.450 --> 16:36.452
I no longer spend my days with
my nose buried in a book.

16:36.487 --> 16:37.862
Oh, you prefer audiobooks now?

16:37.897 --> 16:39.054
No!

16:39.090 --> 16:41.249
(GRUNTS)

16:41.325 --> 16:43.992
I mean, being at Camp
Kikiwaka has changed me.

16:44.028 --> 16:46.011
As I tried to tell you before,

16:46.047 --> 16:47.480
I do not need my big brother

16:47.515 --> 16:49.748
to fight my battles
for me anymore.

16:49.784 --> 16:51.850
Well, now that I think about it,

16:51.886 --> 16:53.286
you did stand up
to that bully Eric.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.129
Twice.

16:55.164 --> 16:56.255
That took guts.

16:56.290 --> 16:59.491
Yes, especially because my nose
was right in his B.O. zone.

16:59.527 --> 17:00.527
Come on.

17:04.524 --> 17:05.789
All right, Ravi, from now on,

17:05.825 --> 17:07.425
you're in charge.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.593
What do you think we should do?

17:08.628 --> 17:09.568
I'm almost out of ammo...

17:09.603 --> 17:11.103
(CHUCKLES) Watch this.

17:16.085 --> 17:17.393
And the only thing you can shoot

17:17.428 --> 17:18.868
with an arrow
is a sleeping snail.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.573
Wait. I have a plan.

17:22.608 --> 17:25.084
Does it involve the
Battle of Water Shoes?

17:25.119 --> 17:28.370
No, but it does involve
my tramp socks.

17:28.405 --> 17:30.181
I don't know where
you're going with this,

17:30.216 --> 17:32.497
but you've gotta stop calling
those things tramp socks.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.490
Hey, Puke,

17:39.525 --> 17:41.605
guess it's down to us three
against you two.

17:42.137 --> 17:43.527
Do the math.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.229
If I don't do math at school,

17:45.231 --> 17:48.298
I'm certainly not going to
do it at summer camp.

17:48.334 --> 17:50.254
Where's your dweeby water
boy with the big mouth?

17:51.438 --> 17:52.687
He ran away.

17:52.722 --> 17:54.288

17:58.144 --> 17:59.910
It's Kikiwaka!

still needs a little work.

Xander, the door
fell on your toe.

And you didn't even
wince in pain.

19:38.469 --> 19:39.877
Oh, right.

Ow, my real toe!

will enjoy that.

Sure, I'm a huge fan
of his armpit farts,

19:59.982 --> 20:02.625

my real hero is, Ravi?

20:02.660 --> 20:04.843
Aww, who?

20:04.879 --> 20:07.872
Rey Mysterio, Jr.,

20:07.907 --> 20:09.947
the best luchador of all time!

20:10.901 --> 20:12.243
Oh.

20:12.278 --> 20:13.278
But after him,

20:14.213 --> 20:15.213
it's you.

20:17.100 --> 20:20.142
Thank you, Jorge.

20:20.177 --> 20:23.103
Hey, Emma, I'm sorry I made
you snort in front of Xander,

20:23.139 --> 20:24.571
but at least I didn't tell
him about that noise

20:24.606 --> 20:26.423
you make when I pull
your left ear.

20:26.458 --> 20:28.938
You do, and it'll be the
last noise you ever hear.

20:30.246 --> 20:32.246
Don't worry.
I'll tell him later.

20:34.859 --> 20:38.168
Luke, thank you again
for helping save The Spot.

20:38.203 --> 20:39.611
In return, I did
all your homework.

20:39.647 --> 20:42.687
I even spilled some nacho cheese
on it to give it that Luke-touch.

20:44.485 --> 20:46.944
Actually, I didn't come here

20:46.979 --> 20:47.236
because I needed help
with my homework.

20:48.105 --> 20:49.838
What?

20:49.874 --> 20:53.150
I knew it. He's hiding
from the cops!

20:53.185 --> 20:54.905
Please tell me there's a reward.

20:56.847 --> 20:59.473
The truth is, I've been getting
straight A's in summer school.

20:59.508 --> 21:02.260
You have?

21:02.262 --> 21:04.829
Well, then why did you come
all the way to Maine?

21:04.864 --> 21:09.700
Because I missed you guys.

21:09.735 --> 21:12.169
But I thought
if I told you that,

21:12.205 --> 21:15.339
you'd think I was being
a wimp. (CHUCKLES)

21:15.374 --> 21:17.733
Aww, we've missed you too.

21:17.768 --> 21:19.568

21:21.380 --> 21:22.988
Well, okay. Wait a minute.

21:23.023 --> 21:24.481
So that means I did 50 pages

21:24.517 --> 21:25.650
of homework for nothing?

21:25.685 --> 21:27.709
Of course not.

21:27.745 --> 21:28.619
I'm gonna sell it
to the dumb kids.
