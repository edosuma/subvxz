WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.309
'The Geordie squad are back.'

00:09.376 --> 00:11.644
This time, it's gonna be massive.

00:11.711 --> 00:14.214
Fuck off, Newcastle.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.883
We're gonna mission
around the party islands.

00:18.151 --> 00:22.255
(screaming)

00:22.322 --> 00:24.591
Things are about to get
Lionel Messi.

00:26.626 --> 00:29.095
There's gonna be pool parties.

00:29.162 --> 00:31.664
Boat parties.

00:31.731 --> 00:33.266
Paint parties.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.668
The biggest parties
of our fucking lives.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.071
More necking on.

00:39.806 --> 00:42.008
Oh, shit.

00:42.075 --> 00:44.611
There's gonna be
shit loads of bucking.

00:46.613 --> 00:49.182
Belly flop! Belly flop!

00:49.249 --> 00:50.784
Let's fucking do this.

00:53.119 --> 00:55.855
There's gonna be carnage.
Fucking little slag!

00:59.893 --> 01:01.928
Kick-offs.
(shouting)

01:01.995 --> 01:03.630
Marnie, Marnie!

01:05.665 --> 01:07.267
Drama.

01:10.036 --> 01:11.638
Oh, my God!
(siren)

01:11.704 --> 01:14.073
Let's get fucking mortal!

01:15.375 --> 01:18.445
This is the ultimate
party island crawl.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.783
(farts) Welcome to the girls' room,
you little radge packet!

01:23.850 --> 01:26.252
Something's up with Gary.
He hasn't pulled.

01:28.922 --> 01:32.091
I finally realised that I do
want to be with Charlotte.

01:32.158 --> 01:35.762
I've got to give it another go.
I'm gonna shave off my hair.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.363
You don't have to do this.

01:37.430 --> 01:40.366
(laughter)

01:41.601 --> 01:46.072
I'll get in bed with Marty. If his
clocks slips in my vagina, result!

01:49.909 --> 01:53.780
I'm not just kissing one bird,
I'm going for the tricycle.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.049
Marty's pulled,
but I'm keeping me cool.

01:56.115 --> 01:58.251
I am not having Marty upset my Chloe.

01:59.118 --> 02:02.489
Marnie swills the three of wuh.
Two can play that game.

02:05.024 --> 02:09.162
Marnie has decided to throw her nose
in other people's businesses.

02:11.631 --> 02:15.568
Marnie, of course I've taken Marty's
side. You're in the fucking wrong.

02:19.105 --> 02:22.909
Aaron shouldn't take Marty's side.
I'm his fucking girlfriend.

02:24.544 --> 02:26.813
I have a degree in pulling women.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.249
Never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.985
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

02:32.051 --> 02:34.287
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:34.354 --> 02:36.656
I'm radge and I wrap
lads around my finger.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.691
I'm preened to perfection.

02:38.758 --> 02:40.627
I'm totally crackers me, like.

02:40.693 --> 02:42.862
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

02:42.929 --> 02:45.131
Me banter's pure naughty.

02:45.198 --> 02:47.267
I'm fake, flirty,
I've got double Fs.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.402
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

03:00.480 --> 03:03.683
It's Holly's birthday today,
and even though we all fell,

03:03.750 --> 03:07.186
I'm gonna make sure today is special
for this little princess.

03:07.253 --> 03:10.456
Starting by blowing my load
all over her face.

03:10.523 --> 03:13.059
Happy birthday!
(screams)

03:13.126 --> 03:15.728
(cheering)

03:15.795 --> 03:18.698
(all) # Happy birthday to you

03:18.765 --> 03:20.967
These bitches
remembered my birthday.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.936
But I'm not expecting much.

03:24.270 --> 03:27.307
Oops. That hippo Nathan
has just broke the bed.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.909
It wasn't me, like.
I'm pure light as a feather.

03:29.976 --> 03:33.212
# Happy birthday to you

03:33.279 --> 03:35.048
Can you hear that?

03:35.114 --> 03:38.484
They're singing happy birthday.
It's not Marnie's birthday.

03:38.551 --> 03:39.719
Or is it? I don't know.

03:39.786 --> 03:42.689
I hope it's not Marnie's.
She'll get nowt from me

03:42.755 --> 03:46.225
Last night, Marnie swilled Marty
for necking on with two birds.

03:46.292 --> 03:48.928
It was none of her business
She's pissed off at me

03:48.995 --> 03:51.598
for saying she's wrong.
We haven't spoken since.

03:51.664 --> 03:55.468
Marnie swilled you. I was like,
"Why have you done that?"

03:55.535 --> 03:57.470
"This is not your argument."

03:58.471 --> 04:02.041
Last night, Marnie fucking
ruined me threesome. We're done.

04:02.108 --> 04:04.978
From there, she was like,
"You should have my back."

04:05.044 --> 04:07.647
I went, "No, Marnie."
I've done nothing wrong.

04:07.714 --> 04:09.682
I ain't apologising for fuck all.

04:09.749 --> 04:13.453
I'm sick of Marnie getting involved
in other people's problems.

04:13.519 --> 04:16.956
There's no way I can stick up for
her when she becomes mad Marnie

04:17.023 --> 04:18.925
after having a drink.

04:22.128 --> 04:24.964
I can understand Marty
probably kicking off with us

04:25.031 --> 04:26.599
because I got the girls wet.

04:26.666 --> 04:29.202
I got them wet,
it's not the end of the world.

04:29.268 --> 04:33.039
I'm Aaron's girlfriend. He could have
said, "You're bang out of order.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.540
But he took it way too far.

04:34.607 --> 04:38.144
Me and Aaron argued again last
night because he took Marty's side

04:38.211 --> 04:39.779
over his own girlfriend.

04:39.846 --> 04:42.849
I don't even wanna look at him,
never mind speak to him.

04:42.915 --> 04:46.519
Obviously, with Martin pulling
last night, it did still hurt us.

04:46.586 --> 04:48.988
But I did keep me cool.
I didn't kick off.

04:49.055 --> 04:51.958
I'm so proud of myself
for not kicking off last night.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.494
It's a good job Marnie
swilled Marty for us.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.129
Soz, not soz.

05:01.601 --> 05:04.370
I'm taking you for a massage.
Yay!

05:04.437 --> 05:07.206
We need this. I love being
stroked by random people.

05:07.273 --> 05:08.975
Today is all about Holly.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.577
But I'm not gonna lie,
it's a bit about me, too.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.579
Cos I am stressed.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.983
Can we not have one day where
there's no fucking kick-offs?

05:18.551 --> 05:21.287
The atmosphere in this house
pure stinks,

05:21.354 --> 05:24.057
and we need to all get ready
to party tonight.

05:24.123 --> 05:26.659
So me and Marnie are off to
the fancy dress shop

05:26.726 --> 05:28.728
cos Holly loves dressing up.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.399
I think all of them
have gone out, you know.

05:33.466 --> 05:35.601
And, like...
They didn't even tell wuh.

05:35.668 --> 05:36.936
Mate, I'm glad though,

05:37.003 --> 05:39.772
cos to be fair,
they're doing my fucking head in.

05:39.839 --> 05:43.609
If Marnie hadn't swilled you...
Everyone woulda had a good night?

05:43.676 --> 05:47.046
Marnie swilling you
literally spoilt the whole night.

05:47.113 --> 05:50.616
Aaron's got morals,
so he's sticking up for what's right.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.453
Which is good,
but it can get you in more shit.

05:53.519 --> 05:57.090
Fuck me. This house, right,
goes from zero to 100

05:57.156 --> 05:59.125
in a matter of seconds.
(laughs)

06:08.735 --> 06:11.504
Hiya, you alreet? English?
English.

06:11.571 --> 06:12.605
Are you? Oh, good.

06:12.672 --> 06:15.341
Marty's been treating me really bad
for ages now.

06:15.408 --> 06:18.611
He knows how much I like him,
and he takes advantage of that.

06:18.678 --> 06:22.248
And when he doesn't, he treats us
like a bad smell. Payback time.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.617
All the lads are gonna
look like dickheads.

06:24.684 --> 06:27.120
That is the ugliest costume
I've ever seen.

06:27.186 --> 06:28.788
Shall we get that for Aaron?

06:28.855 --> 06:31.324
Cowboy?
(laughs)

06:31.390 --> 06:35.161
The world's shittest boy.
Ooh, yeah, perfect. (gasps) Martin.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.295
(THEY LAUGH)

06:36.362 --> 06:38.097
He's never gonna pull.

06:38.164 --> 06:42.101
If Marty loves girls this much,
he may as well look like one.

06:42.168 --> 06:45.838
He's gonna look so worldie
in this toga. Or not.

06:46.806 --> 06:50.076
Look what I've just fucking found.
(laughs)

06:51.477 --> 06:54.647
We've literally found the
most hideous outfits in the shop.

06:54.714 --> 06:57.784
Serves them right.
Don't mess with us bitches.

06:58.851 --> 07:01.320
I'm so grateful for you
sticking up for us?

07:01.387 --> 07:03.823
I don't regret it.
I really don't regret it.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.825
Marnie having me back meant so much.

07:05.892 --> 07:08.427
I don't know where it leaves
Marnie and Aaron.

07:08.494 --> 07:11.330
I feel like Aaron
would always take Martin's side.

07:11.397 --> 07:14.333
For once, I just wish
he could have stayed out of it.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.403
I'll always have me friend's back,
but if it came to it,

07:17.470 --> 07:21.107
I would put Aaron before me friends.
Shame he doesn't feel the same.

07:21.174 --> 07:25.411
Martin gets involved in our shit.
I'm entitled to get involved in his.

07:25.478 --> 07:27.580
Holly's birthday,
we need a good night.

07:27.647 --> 07:31.284
If Aaron really loves us, he better
say sorry for not having me back.

07:31.350 --> 07:32.652
Bye, love you.

07:32.718 --> 07:34.887
Bye. Love you so much. Kiss, kiss.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.996
Hello.
Hello.

07:44.063 --> 07:46.699
I'm actually really excited
about this massage.

07:46.766 --> 07:49.735
I haven't been rubbed all over
since Kyle was here.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.804
Oh, that's a good massage.
Mm-hmm.

07:53.039 --> 07:54.841
Nathan?
Mm-hmm?

07:54.907 --> 07:56.709
This was the best idea ever.

07:56.776 --> 07:59.178
Partly, I did it
cos I wanted to benefit you,

07:59.245 --> 08:02.582
but I feel like, right now,
I'm reaping the rewards. You are.

08:02.648 --> 08:03.683
Oh, that's good.

08:03.749 --> 08:06.919
Oh, that's good. That's good.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.021
Mm, that feels nice.

08:09.088 --> 08:12.992
Yes. (moans)

08:14.293 --> 08:16.128
(laughs)

08:16.195 --> 08:18.397
I'm trying to relax
and all I can hear is,

08:18.464 --> 08:21.667
"Oh, yeah. Oh!"
Is he getting a happy ending?

08:26.205 --> 08:28.207
I'm not a loud moaner, to be honest.

08:28.274 --> 08:31.143
Yeah, right.
That's not what I've heard.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.412
And I mean actually heard.

08:33.479 --> 08:34.914
I am.

08:35.948 --> 08:38.484
Oh, that's a good massage.
Mm-hmm.

08:42.154 --> 08:44.857
I'm dreading seeing the boys
after last night.

08:44.924 --> 08:47.126
But I cannot wait to see their faces

08:47.193 --> 08:50.129
on what they have to wear
for Holly's birthday.

08:50.730 --> 08:53.099
Hiya.
I know that we're all not speaking,

08:53.165 --> 08:55.101
but it is Holly's birthday today.

08:55.167 --> 08:58.371
Me and Marnie's been shopping
for some fancy dress.

08:59.205 --> 09:02.508
This is the first time I've
seen Aaron since the argument.

09:02.575 --> 09:05.778
He should be saying sorry,
instead he's just ignoring us.

09:05.845 --> 09:08.147
Why is he putting us through this?

09:08.214 --> 09:09.815
Here's some pants, Aaron.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.685
Yesterday, me and Marnie
were practically married.

09:12.752 --> 09:15.054
But she managed to ruin that
in one night.

09:15.121 --> 09:17.523
I can't even look at her right now.

09:17.590 --> 09:22.261
This is yours, Gary.
"'70s rocket man." Are you mad?

09:22.328 --> 09:26.465
Have I seriously gotta wear this?
Holly, you owe me big time.

09:26.532 --> 09:29.635
I just think, for one night,
let's please have a good night.

09:30.269 --> 09:32.772
I didn't kick off, babe.

09:32.838 --> 09:36.175
First, Chloe's telling wuh
we have to wear these shit outfits,

09:36.242 --> 09:38.744
and now she's telling wuh
to have a good night?

09:38.811 --> 09:40.813
She's the one that always kicks off.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.549
You're starting already!
Am I fuck? Yeah, you are.

09:43.616 --> 09:47.186
Why can you not shut your trap
for one day? It's Holly's birthday.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.522
I'm not talking to you!

09:51.390 --> 09:53.025
Go on, then, fuck off.

09:53.793 --> 09:57.763
Already spoiling the fucking night
cos you love to fucking argue.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.399
Aaron is still ignoring us
and I'm gutted.

10:00.466 --> 10:02.435
I just don't know where we're at.

10:03.636 --> 10:06.105
I'm just gonna go
and sort out the bedroom.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.774
I wanna be by myself.

10:08.841 --> 10:12.044
Me and Aaron have been through
so much to get to where we are,

10:12.111 --> 10:14.847
and this whole thing with Marty's
fucked it all up.

10:14.914 --> 10:18.217
Obviously I don't like it
when me and Marnie aren't talking.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.821
But she can't do what she done
and expect everything to just be OK.

10:21.887 --> 10:24.824
(sobs)

10:24.890 --> 10:27.159
Aaron needs to sort
his priorities out.

10:27.226 --> 10:30.429
What type of boyfriend lets
their girlfriend go off and cry

10:30.496 --> 10:32.732
over a stupid argument
over spilt water.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.934
Are you all right? Don't cry.

10:36.802 --> 10:40.773
I know it's hard. Let it all out.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.642
It's better when you
let all your tears out.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.511
It's all right.

10:46.245 --> 10:49.181
Him? Make you angry?

10:49.248 --> 10:52.818
So irritating, man.
I honestly hate the pair of them.

10:52.885 --> 10:56.288
I'm stressed,
so stressed out and frustrated.

10:56.355 --> 10:59.291
This is ridiculous,
but what hurts us is the fact that

10:59.358 --> 11:02.061
I must care about Aaron
more than he cares about me.

11:02.128 --> 11:04.563
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.

11:04.630 --> 11:07.800
You should come before his friends.
You're his girlfriend.

11:07.867 --> 11:10.269
I don't, though.
I know. That's wrong.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.838
I never have, even in the past, ever.

11:12.905 --> 11:15.408
I just hate how upset
you're getting. I know.

11:15.474 --> 11:16.976
It's awful.

11:17.043 --> 11:19.045
Aaron is hurting Marnie so much.

11:19.111 --> 11:22.348
What's Aaron's problem?
Why doesn't he just apologise?

11:22.415 --> 11:25.584
The chicken head is actually
making us feel happier. Is it?

11:25.651 --> 11:28.687
Just think how happy chickens
have it. (they laugh)

11:28.754 --> 11:30.589
Give us a cuddle.
Thanks so much.

11:30.656 --> 11:32.892
I don't know what I'd do without you.

11:35.594 --> 11:37.096
(laughs)
Fucking hell!

11:37.163 --> 11:40.299
Last time I'll go through
a day of awkwardness with Aaron.

11:40.366 --> 11:44.937
Things still aren't great, but
everyone's promised not to kick off.

11:45.004 --> 11:48.340
If yous have got me a stripper,
I swear, I will leave the house.

11:48.407 --> 11:52.311
Oi, oi! Surprise!

11:57.016 --> 11:57.216
.

11:59.718 --> 11:59.919
.

11:59.985 --> 12:03.722
Alreet? Very bad language and
sexual scenes continue throughout,

12:03.789 --> 12:06.325
so please stop watching
if this isn't for you.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.094
Consider yourselves warned.

12:10.796 --> 12:13.866
I'm happy to decorate the place
for Holly's birthday,

12:13.933 --> 12:16.368
but if Marnie thinks
I'm going to apologise,

12:16.435 --> 12:19.071
she's gonna be waiting
a very long time.

12:22.074 --> 12:25.377
Me and Holly are super chilled out
after our massages.

12:25.444 --> 12:28.814
I just hope the rest of the house
has chilled the fuck out, too.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.852
Happy birthday.
Thanks.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.320
What the hell is going on,

12:34.386 --> 12:37.156
and why are Marnie and Chloe
acting so weird?

12:38.390 --> 12:40.426
(cheers) Surprise!

12:40.493 --> 12:42.928
Aww. This is so cute.

12:42.995 --> 12:46.398
Oh, my God. Everyone has decorated
and it looks amazing.

12:46.465 --> 12:48.367
And seems to be getting along.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.169
Look, Holly!

12:51.003 --> 12:52.571
(laughs)

12:52.638 --> 12:53.772
Fucking hell, man!

12:53.839 --> 12:56.208
(cheers)

12:56.275 --> 12:58.544
Holly is actually smiling for once.

12:58.611 --> 13:02.148
I think it's the first time I've
seen her gnashers. She loves it.

13:02.214 --> 13:06.185
Right, everyone, obviously we know
today is Holly's birthday.

13:06.252 --> 13:09.822
So tonight, I know things are frosty
in the camp... Fucking frosty?

13:09.889 --> 13:13.459
That's an understatement.
It's Brass Monkeys in here, mate.

13:13.526 --> 13:17.163
...we're gonna try to have a good
night, go out and get pissed.

13:17.229 --> 13:19.899
No arguments. Holly, happy birthday.
(all cheer)

13:19.965 --> 13:22.034
Right, everyone get dressed.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.272
Last one to the bedroom's a cake.

13:30.943 --> 13:32.478
Are you gonna talk to Marnie?

13:32.545 --> 13:35.281
If she talks... There's no way
I'm walking up to her.

13:35.347 --> 13:38.884
If she comes and apologises,
I'll talk to her, but why should I?

13:38.951 --> 13:42.188
Me and Marnie still haven't spoken
since she swilled Marty.

13:42.254 --> 13:44.957
She was in the wrong
and I won't fucking talk to her

13:45.024 --> 13:46.892
until she admits that.

13:46.959 --> 13:49.028
That looks fucking wicked, that.

13:49.094 --> 13:50.930
How the fuck have we been convinced

13:50.996 --> 13:53.933
to wear a dress,
some random hippy outfit,

13:53.999 --> 13:57.436
and I look like fucking shit Elvis.
I fucking hate fancy dress.

13:57.503 --> 14:01.006
But it's Holly's birthday,
so she gets what she wants.

14:01.073 --> 14:03.776
I think the puppies look well,
though. (laughs)

14:03.842 --> 14:06.812
There's a lot of tension
in the house at the minute,

14:06.879 --> 14:10.616
but there's one thing you can't deny.
I look fabulous in me new dress.

14:12.651 --> 14:15.854
Holly, do you like your outfit?
Love it. Thanks, girls.

14:15.921 --> 14:18.257
Have you spoken to Aaron today,
Marns? #No.

14:18.324 --> 14:21.460
Last time I'll go through
a day of awkwardness with Aaron.

14:21.527 --> 14:24.463
Things still aren't great
between Aaron and Marnie,

14:24.530 --> 14:27.266
but tonight,
everyone's promised not to kick off.

14:27.333 --> 14:30.069
But I won't hold me breath.
How are you so creative?

14:30.135 --> 14:32.338
I wish I was.
You should be on Art Attack.

14:32.404 --> 14:34.707
What are you actually
supposed to be?

14:34.773 --> 14:37.943
I'm just making it up as I go along.
You look like a compass.

14:38.010 --> 14:41.213
Fuck off. Just cos I'm bald
and I know how to work it.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.748
Those bitches are jealous.

14:45.651 --> 14:47.586
We're all ready to go out,

14:47.653 --> 14:51.323
but I've got another little
surprise for Holly, a cake.

14:51.390 --> 14:54.493
No candles.
Candles, candles, candles, candles?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.929
Shit! I can't find
any birthday candles.

14:59.531 --> 15:00.566
(grunts)

15:00.633 --> 15:01.667
Perfect.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.203
You know what they say,
the bigger the better.

15:05.604 --> 15:07.773
There was no, erm, lighters.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.208
There was no thingies.

15:09.275 --> 15:12.811
So I put a candle on it instead.
Right. That's fine. It looks...

15:12.878 --> 15:14.546
OK.

15:16.015 --> 15:18.017
Anyone wanna try some? Go on!

15:18.083 --> 15:21.620
With Chloe's personal hygiene's,
I don't even wanna touch it.

15:21.687 --> 15:24.189
Who's ready to get drunk?
Yeah!

15:24.256 --> 15:27.559
Let's get the fuck out of this
villa and actually celebrate.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.868
It's time to do what we do best,
get mortal.

15:44.243 --> 15:47.579
I've organised for pre-drinks
at my favourite bar in Napa.

15:47.646 --> 15:48.981
Holly's gonna love it.

15:49.048 --> 15:52.785
If yous have got me a stripper,
I swear, I will leave the house.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.056
This is the calm before the storm,
Holly.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.625
Fancy dress, you love fancy dress.

16:01.493 --> 16:04.997
Right, I want to do a little toast
anyway, for Holly's birthday.

16:06.332 --> 16:09.468
Cheers. Let's have a good night.
Aww. Thanks you, Gary.

16:13.405 --> 16:14.673
Oi, oi!

16:18.043 --> 16:19.578
Oh, my God. It's Kyle.

16:19.645 --> 16:20.979
(laughs)

16:21.046 --> 16:22.915
Happy birthday.

16:24.249 --> 16:28.053
Surprise. I couldn't let Holly's
birthday go without an appearance.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.490
Nathan tipped me off,
and she is looking fit.

16:31.557 --> 16:33.425
Get in. Kyle's just walked in.

16:33.492 --> 16:36.328
The one person that can
keep a smile on Holly's face.

16:39.765 --> 16:42.167
I'm so happy for Holly
that Kyle turned up.

16:42.234 --> 16:44.970
She can't stop smiling.
They might not be together,

16:45.037 --> 16:47.773
but there's still definitely
something there.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.343
Kyle's arrived, but how did he
know it was fancy dress?

16:52.711 --> 16:56.215
I heard you was all out here,
and I came back for you birthday.

16:56.281 --> 16:58.650
Happy birthday.
Thank you, kid.

16:59.451 --> 17:02.187
I couldn't have asked for
a better birthday.

17:02.254 --> 17:04.757
Welcome back, Kyle.
(all cheer)

17:04.823 --> 17:09.161
Right, now that Kyle's here, let's
just go to the club and get fucked.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.336
I hope she was buzzing that
I'm back. I'm sure she was.

17:17.403 --> 17:18.771
She shed a little tear.

17:18.837 --> 17:21.406
I've made Holly cry a lot
in the past,

17:21.473 --> 17:24.810
but I'm just glad this is
tears of joy. Hopefully.

17:24.877 --> 17:29.014
I feel like I was fucking shaking,
me. I was like... (whimpers)

17:30.215 --> 17:33.085
We're in Napa, Kyle's here.
And the club's wicked.

17:33.152 --> 17:35.154
Let's get this party started.

17:52.438 --> 17:54.473
(all cheer)

18:00.879 --> 18:02.681
Fancy dress is OK for a bit,

18:02.748 --> 18:06.285
but me and the boys have got
a reputation to maintain.

18:09.888 --> 18:12.624
He had more chance pulling
in the toga. Oh, well.

18:12.691 --> 18:13.692
Tissue, anyone?

18:28.073 --> 18:31.543
I absolutely love having Kyle here
and I know we're not together,

18:31.610 --> 18:33.912
but he is looking canny fit tonight.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.789
Stop flirting with us, Kyle.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.125
Even though I am flirting back
a little bit

18:46.191 --> 18:49.761
and I'm trying to play it really
cool and pretend I don't fancy him.

18:49.828 --> 18:53.098
It's great hanging out with Holly.
She's being super cheeky,

18:53.165 --> 18:56.134
and I cannot stop looking at
her arse in that catsuit.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.588
I'm laughing in front of the lads,

19:16.655 --> 19:19.925
but Marnie not apologising
is really starting to bother us.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.194
I'm won't be the first to crack,
though.

19:35.507 --> 19:39.811
Oh, my God. I've just realised how
revealing my catsuit actually is.

20:03.135 --> 20:05.837
I'm hoping that Aaron's
gonna come and speak to us.

20:05.904 --> 20:08.907
He can't throw our relationship away
because of Marty.

20:20.185 --> 20:24.122
Marnie and Aaron are so stubborn
and they shouldn't let me and Marty

20:24.189 --> 20:27.292
get in the way.
They've got something so special.

20:38.637 --> 20:42.107
Me and Holly have known each other
a long time, been through a lot.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.476
So tonight,
we're having a good night.

20:50.315 --> 20:52.684
I actually feel like
I'm getting emotional.

20:54.987 --> 20:58.023
It seems like only yesterday
that I walked into the house

20:58.090 --> 21:01.927
nobody wanted to be me friend.
And now look at us!

21:09.935 --> 21:12.738
Half of the family might
actually hate each other,

21:12.804 --> 21:15.874
but tonight has been wicked.
I just hope it stays like this.

21:19.244 --> 21:21.947
That was the best night
I've ever had in my life.

21:22.014 --> 21:25.984
Fucking hell, Marty, what have you
been doing for the last 20 years?

21:30.255 --> 21:32.891
I've tried so hard
to have a good time tonight,

21:32.958 --> 21:36.028
but Aaron still hasn't made
the first move and I'm gutted.

21:36.094 --> 21:38.930
I just need to go to bed
and forget this night happened.

21:41.066 --> 21:42.968
If you wanna go in the pool...

21:43.035 --> 21:46.171
# Holly's in the pool
# Holly's in the pool

21:46.238 --> 21:47.239
# La, la, la

21:47.839 --> 21:49.641
Happy birthday!

21:51.410 --> 21:54.046
# Holly's in the pool
La, la, la #

21:54.112 --> 21:56.014
Hollys' gonna be sick in the pool.

21:56.081 --> 21:57.649
Oh!

21:57.716 --> 22:01.086
Kyle and Holly
are supposedly not a couple.

22:01.153 --> 22:05.957
I know when something's going on,
and I also know where I'm not wanted.

22:19.204 --> 22:23.008
I may be wet all over, but this
has been the best birthday ever.

22:24.376 --> 22:27.546
(laughs)
That's just totally see-through now.

22:28.313 --> 22:30.382
There is no harm in flirting,
is there?

22:30.449 --> 22:32.617
I mean,
me and Kyle know what we're doing.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.686
We won't make
the same mistake again.

22:34.753 --> 22:37.956
Now everyone's gone to bed,
and I've got Holly all to myself,

22:38.023 --> 22:40.392
it's time to get
proper dirty with her.

22:44.863 --> 22:45.997
This is war.

22:59.511 --> 23:04.850
Whoo! Don't let go, man!
I just hope I don't shit myself.

23:04.916 --> 23:06.518
That dipshit walked past.

23:06.585 --> 23:07.886
This is over.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.423
Fucking hell.
That bastard nearly had me head off.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.725
You're the only one
who causes problems.

23:13.792 --> 23:15.093
Marty is a wanker.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.362
Is it not work...
(screaming)

23:22.467 --> 23:22.667
.

23:25.203 --> 23:25.403
.

23:25.470 --> 23:29.007
This part has loads more talk about
sex, as well as sexual scenes

23:29.074 --> 23:31.109
and the usual very strong language.

23:31.176 --> 23:33.545
Please stop watching
if this isn't for you.

23:33.612 --> 23:35.647
If it is, you're in for a treat.
Howay.

23:46.391 --> 23:47.392
Holly!

23:48.794 --> 23:50.295
You're one year older.

23:50.362 --> 23:52.964
I'm so glad that Holly
had a good night last night.

23:53.031 --> 23:55.634
The family managed to
pull it together for her.

23:57.569 --> 24:01.206
How are you feeling about Aaron?
The awkwardness is now over.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.809
And now it's just like...
he's not there.

24:03.875 --> 24:07.078
Such a shame cos a few days ago,
yous were happy.

24:07.145 --> 24:09.581
And then now...
it's just gone to shit.

24:09.648 --> 24:13.218
Me and Aaron have been through
so much to get to where we are.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.954
And this whole thing with Marty's
fucked it all up.

24:20.792 --> 24:23.628
So, what's the craic
between you and Marnie, then?

24:23.695 --> 24:25.297
Are yous together?
(sighs)

24:25.363 --> 24:27.065
We're together, but...

24:29.167 --> 24:31.403
Thing is, it looks like
it's a stand-off,

24:31.469 --> 24:33.138
cos I'm not apologising.

24:33.205 --> 24:36.508
Me and Marnie still haven't spoken
since she swilled Marty.

24:36.575 --> 24:39.244
She was in the wrong
and I won't fucking talk to her

24:39.311 --> 24:41.479
until she admits that.
(groans)

24:41.546 --> 24:45.116
Know what it sounds like to me?
You've all gone fucking bonkers.

24:45.183 --> 24:48.220
We all need to get out of this house
and get some fresh air.

24:48.286 --> 24:51.189
My idea is to take everyone
jet-skiing and water sport.

24:59.798 --> 25:03.702
Kyle might look like one big,
dumb charity shop window mannequin,

25:03.768 --> 25:06.037
but every now and again,
he has a good idea.

25:06.104 --> 25:09.341
Jet skis, come on this side.
Paragliding, this side.

25:09.407 --> 25:12.210
Another day, and me and Marnie
still haven't spoke.

25:12.277 --> 25:15.780
I knew she was stubborn, but this
is a different level altogether.

25:15.847 --> 25:18.350
But I'm right
and I refuse to fucking crack.

25:19.184 --> 25:22.387
There's absolutely no chance
I'm gonna apologise to Aaron.

25:22.454 --> 25:25.290
He was in the wrong,
he should make the first move.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.692
Is there not, like,
weight conditions?

25:27.759 --> 25:30.328
What are you trying to say,
you cheeky bitch?

25:30.395 --> 25:34.199
Weight restriction? I've shaved
my hair off. I weigh less now.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.668
To the jet skis, let's fuck off.
Let's go.

25:50.548 --> 25:54.452
Marty, you see that thing on the
right-hand side of the jet ski?

25:54.519 --> 25:58.123
It's called an accelerator.
I've seen a grandma go faster

25:58.189 --> 26:00.625
on a mobility scooter
than you're going now.

26:07.332 --> 26:09.067
Faster!
Faster!

26:09.134 --> 26:11.202
Faster, faster, faster!

26:11.269 --> 26:14.306
This looks so scary, I'm so nervous.

26:14.372 --> 26:16.174
I just hope I don't shit myself.

26:23.248 --> 26:26.885
Aah, aah, aaaah!

26:26.952 --> 26:29.154
Aah! Get it down!

26:30.288 --> 26:31.656
I wanna get down.

26:31.723 --> 26:35.060
I didn't like it, I don't know
why any human being would wanna be

26:35.126 --> 26:37.662
that far up in the sky,
looking down at the ocean

26:37.729 --> 26:41.066
with fucking sharks in it.
It's not human-anity.

26:52.744 --> 26:56.047
Today was wicked.
But to be honest, I'm really confused

26:56.114 --> 26:59.284
because I still love Aaron
and I really want to be with him,

26:59.351 --> 27:01.219
but I haven't got a future with him

27:01.286 --> 27:03.588
if he's gonna act
the way he's been acting.

27:03.655 --> 27:05.824
You all right?
Yeah, how are you feeling?

27:05.890 --> 27:09.027
I'm having a good day, me.
Have you spoken to Aaron yet? No.

27:09.094 --> 27:12.330
I just feel like,
if he cared about us at all,

27:12.397 --> 27:14.532
he would have came over
and spoke to us.

27:14.599 --> 27:16.801
I feel upset because
I just feel like...

27:16.868 --> 27:19.004
Like, all of this
was just for nothing.

27:19.070 --> 27:21.339
I've put so much effort
into me and Aaron.

27:21.406 --> 27:23.541
It's been going on
for three years now.

27:23.608 --> 27:26.745
And it's all came crashing down
over a stupid argument.

27:26.811 --> 27:30.248
I love yous together. If you feel
like this, you can't be with him.

27:30.315 --> 27:33.385
You need someone who makes
you happy. You're miserable.

27:33.451 --> 27:36.788
If you feel in your heart it's over,
you need to tell him.

27:36.855 --> 27:38.857
I think he knows, we haven't spoke.

27:38.923 --> 27:42.027
The thing is,
they're both so similar.

27:42.093 --> 27:44.629
And neither of them
will admit they're wrong.

27:44.696 --> 27:46.765
And that could be their downfall.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.039
Well, that was awkward.

27:54.105 --> 27:57.108
This isn't right.
I'm supposed to be his girlfriend.

28:07.152 --> 28:10.655
Today has been another tense day
for the Geordie family

28:10.722 --> 28:12.690
and we're all getting ready
to go out.

28:12.757 --> 28:16.995
I'm just praying that tonight is
gonna be OK. Please, please be OK.

28:19.931 --> 28:21.866
Aaron's chafing from the jet skis.

28:21.933 --> 28:25.637
That looks more painful than us
having to go out with them girls.

28:25.703 --> 28:27.238
(groans)
(laughs)

28:32.277 --> 28:35.447
I don't think anyone's really in
an arguing type of mood now.

28:35.513 --> 28:38.416
I feel like that's kind of passed,
hasn't it? Yeah.

28:38.483 --> 28:42.454
And I think, the boys especially,
just fucking need to grow up.

28:42.520 --> 28:44.456
They do.
They're fucking divvies.

28:44.522 --> 28:48.726
I've never met anything like it.
I'm more mature than them. Well...

28:48.793 --> 28:50.628
Chloe? More mature than anyone?

28:50.695 --> 28:52.397
Yeah, no.

28:54.833 --> 28:58.303
Me and Aaron definitely need
to speak, so I'm just waiting.

28:58.369 --> 29:02.373
We're all sick of waiting. One of
yous needs to stop being so childish

29:02.440 --> 29:05.477
and say sorry so the family
can get back together again.

29:05.543 --> 29:08.813
His priority should be me
and his relationship. Not Martin.

29:11.116 --> 29:14.052
If you're in the wrong,
you know you are to admit it to me.

29:14.119 --> 29:16.855
If I was in the wrong,
I'd apologise.

29:16.921 --> 29:21.493
All it takes her to do is literally
go, "Yes, I was doing this for Chloe,

29:21.559 --> 29:25.029
whatever, but I was in the wrong
for swilling Marty."

29:25.096 --> 29:28.533
I still can't believe Marnie hasn't
admitted she was in the wrong

29:28.600 --> 29:29.701
for swilling Marty.

29:29.767 --> 29:33.037
Why get grief for something
that was nothing to do with you?

29:33.104 --> 29:36.608
It's gonna be a fucking very long
few days cos I ain't saying shit.

29:36.674 --> 29:39.144
I don't get why Marnie
won't back down.

29:39.210 --> 29:42.347
She knows she's in the wrong,
and there's fucking no chance

29:42.413 --> 29:44.048
I'm taking the blame for this.

29:44.115 --> 29:47.118
Until Marnie apologises,
he doesn't speak to her.

29:47.185 --> 29:50.688
This is getting ridiculous. Someone
needs to take the first step,

29:50.755 --> 29:53.124
apologise and sort this shit out.

29:53.191 --> 29:55.226
Let's go,
you fucking son of a bitch!

29:55.293 --> 29:56.294
(laughs)

29:56.361 --> 29:57.595
Girls, howay!

30:01.266 --> 30:04.736
Tonight, before we hit the club,
we're gonna stop at a fun fair.

30:04.802 --> 30:07.572
Cos everybody could do
with a little bit of fun.

30:16.080 --> 30:19.017
Lunar Park looks amazing.
I can't wait to get stuck in

30:19.083 --> 30:21.653
and get on some rides.
Shall we go on the dodgems?

30:21.719 --> 30:25.089
Just because we're at a fun fair,
doesn't mean we'll dress down.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.892
We're Geordies, for fuck's sake!
Dodgems!

30:27.959 --> 30:29.060
Dodgems!

30:29.127 --> 30:31.062
Hiya!
Let's go, let's go.

30:31.129 --> 30:33.798
Let's go! (laughs)

30:33.865 --> 30:35.500
First stop is the bumper cars.

30:35.567 --> 30:36.868
Let the games begin.

30:36.935 --> 30:39.137
Ram them as much as you possibly can.

30:39.204 --> 30:42.507
This is war.
We need to get Marty and Aaron.

30:42.574 --> 30:46.844
Me and the girls vs the boys.
This is one way to relieve tension.

30:46.911 --> 30:48.947
One, two, three, go.
(all cheer)

30:49.013 --> 30:50.081
This is war.

30:50.148 --> 30:51.516
(bell rings)
Go!

31:01.226 --> 31:03.027
(laughs)
We've had our fun,

31:03.094 --> 31:05.697
now it's time for
Operation: Get The Girls.

31:05.763 --> 31:07.432
No, Aaron!

31:08.166 --> 31:09.434
(screams)

31:11.769 --> 31:13.438
(laughs)

31:13.504 --> 31:16.841
Fucking hell!
That bastard nearly had me head off.

31:16.908 --> 31:18.643
Aaron, man! (screams)

31:18.710 --> 31:21.346
Right, fuck off now.
You've pissed us off.

31:21.412 --> 31:24.916
This is awful. Everyone is going
for me, and I don't like it.

31:29.254 --> 31:31.789
Chloe, you all right, babe?
No, I'm not!

31:31.856 --> 31:32.857
Boring!

31:32.924 --> 31:34.259
(bell rings)

31:34.325 --> 31:37.161
It's not funny cos I've
really injured myself.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.263
I've broke a nail.

31:38.329 --> 31:40.265
That was fucking mint.

31:40.331 --> 31:42.567
Operation: Get The Girls
was a success.

31:42.634 --> 31:45.570
That was brilliant!

31:49.173 --> 31:51.709
Anyone fancy a bungee?
Yes! I do!

31:51.776 --> 31:54.545
Nah, not me. Gaz and Aaron
go to do the slingshot.

31:54.612 --> 31:57.482
And I'd rather sit on me own
than sit with them divvies.

31:57.548 --> 32:00.351
I don't know why I do this.
I fucking hate this.

32:01.686 --> 32:04.689
What's wrong with you, Martin?
I don't like most of yous.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.158
We don't fucking like you either.
Exactly.

32:07.225 --> 32:10.762
I know what Marty's trying to do,
argue with us to where I explode

32:10.828 --> 32:13.965
and do something I regret
so he can look like the good guy.

32:14.032 --> 32:16.734
You're the only one causing problems.
How's that?

32:16.801 --> 32:19.237
You're the only one.
Them two aren't. You are.

32:19.304 --> 32:23.341
Marty is a wanker.
Every argument is caused by him.

32:23.408 --> 32:25.276
Fuck off then.
Why would I fuck off?

32:25.343 --> 32:29.013
You're the only one who
causes problems. Oh, you're mad!

32:29.080 --> 32:32.116
Marnie's saying I'm the one
that causes all the problems

32:32.183 --> 32:35.386
and I'm being awkward.
Are you having a fucking laugh?

32:35.453 --> 32:38.489
I'm gonna be sick already.
Oh, please.

32:38.556 --> 32:41.459
Is it not work...
(both scream)

32:41.526 --> 32:45.463
I'm gonna lie,
I am fucking shite-ing myself.

32:45.530 --> 32:47.665
Fucking hell!

32:49.867 --> 32:52.603
Oh, my God.
(both laugh)

32:52.670 --> 32:55.707
My two fellow soldiers
are flying about in a slingshot

32:55.773 --> 32:57.408
and I'm being ganged up on.

32:57.475 --> 32:59.911
Bastards. Never leave a man behind.

33:01.612 --> 33:02.947
That one is quick.

33:03.014 --> 33:05.717
Shall we go to the club?
Yeah, let's go to the club.

33:06.684 --> 33:09.020
This fun fair has put me
in a right mood.

33:09.087 --> 33:11.356
Get me to the club
and get me fucked.

33:15.393 --> 33:17.295
This stand-off's gone too far.

33:17.362 --> 33:20.198
Why is he making me look like
a fucking cunt?!

33:20.264 --> 33:22.667
I don't like you, you and you.

33:22.734 --> 33:23.901
How fucking dare he.

33:23.968 --> 33:25.503
They've left you, in bed!

33:27.605 --> 33:29.841
How can I like someone
who's that nasty?

33:29.907 --> 33:31.609
I'm gutted!

33:36.948 --> 33:37.148
.#

33:39.684 --> 33:39.884
.

33:39.951 --> 33:43.020
This part contains loads of
bad language and sex scenes

33:43.087 --> 33:46.023
right from the off and throughout,
plenty of nudity,

33:46.090 --> 33:48.292
and aggressive
and violent behaviour.

33:48.359 --> 33:50.528
If that's not for you,
turn over now.

33:55.133 --> 33:56.701
The family are still fucked.

33:56.768 --> 33:59.537
Marnie just went in on Marty
at the fun fair

33:59.604 --> 34:03.040
and this club is exactly what we
need to forget about everything

34:03.107 --> 34:04.242
and get mortal.

34:10.614 --> 34:12.617
The way it's going at the minute,

34:12.683 --> 34:15.719
it doesn't look like this will
get sorted anytime soon.

34:15.786 --> 34:17.255
And I couldn't give a fuck.

34:22.793 --> 34:25.263
Shit. I thought things
were bad enough,

34:25.329 --> 34:27.732
now Marnie's just made them
ten times worse.

34:33.004 --> 34:37.007
The more I look at Marty, the more I
think I would never go back there.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.277
What was I thinking?
He's a massive dick.

34:53.224 --> 34:56.627
I'll always be there for Marnie.
She's always been there for me

34:56.694 --> 34:59.597
and I'll always be there for her.
That'll never change.

35:05.403 --> 35:07.738
I'm not Cupid
and I'm not an expert in love,

35:07.805 --> 35:11.509
but I can quite clearly tell
when two people like each other.

35:12.210 --> 35:14.078
Was that Holly's hand on me cock?

35:15.480 --> 35:17.482
It's been a while,
but I'm sure it was.

35:26.157 --> 35:28.893
What has just happened
to Holly's face?

35:32.930 --> 35:34.565
She's Kyle obsessed.

36:02.126 --> 36:05.830
This stand-off's gone too far.
I'm going over to speak to Marnie.

36:07.598 --> 36:11.335
Finally, a breakthrough. I just hope
he doesn't lose his temper.

36:11.402 --> 36:13.571
Cos he's had one too many drinks.

36:13.638 --> 36:17.008
I'm so pleased that Aaron's came over
and made the first move.

36:17.074 --> 36:20.011
He was in the wrong.
I just hope he's gonna apologise.

36:30.154 --> 36:33.858
Aaron's saying he doesn't care
about Marty or Chloe, only about me.

36:33.925 --> 36:35.359
That's a fucking lie.

36:48.105 --> 36:51.008
Over the last few days,
I've learned a lot about Aaron.

36:51.075 --> 36:52.877
And what I've learned isn't good.

36:52.944 --> 36:55.880
He took his friend's side
over his girlfriend.

37:03.688 --> 37:06.891
I do still wanna be with Marnie,
but the way she's going on,

37:06.958 --> 37:08.693
I just don't see a future for us.

37:13.598 --> 37:17.034
We're done, so it's over.
What a fucking waste of time.

37:21.205 --> 37:23.941
All of this time trying to
make it work with Aaron,

37:24.008 --> 37:27.211
and that stupid arsehole
has ended our relationship.

37:27.278 --> 37:28.779
This is fucked up.

37:28.846 --> 37:29.847
(yells)

37:35.319 --> 37:38.956
Why is he making me look
like a fucking cunt?!

37:39.023 --> 37:41.826
I just hate that I care about him!

37:41.892 --> 37:44.061
If Aaron can make someone
feel like this,

37:44.128 --> 37:47.198
who he's supposed to care about,
he's not worth it.

37:47.264 --> 37:50.968
Marnie, Marnie! Why is he
making me feel like a fucking mug?!

37:51.035 --> 37:54.238
Take it out, take it out.
(muffled scream)

37:54.305 --> 37:57.341
Everything was going so well
and I really loved Aaron.

37:57.408 --> 37:59.543
I don't know how
I'm gonna deal with it.

37:59.610 --> 38:01.212
Don't keep it in. Let it out.

38:01.278 --> 38:03.748
No boy should ever make a girl
feel like this.

38:03.814 --> 38:06.117
You're worth so much more.

38:09.887 --> 38:13.290
Aaron getting rid of her
is probably the best thing for him.

38:16.694 --> 38:19.964
Me and Marnie are over
and I'm fucking gutted.

38:20.031 --> 38:22.867
I'm never ever gonna show Aaron
that I'm bothered.

38:22.933 --> 38:25.469
So I'm just gonna get mortal,
have a good night

38:25.536 --> 38:28.372
and show him that I don't need him
to have a good time.

38:28.439 --> 38:31.542
They are expecting us to kick off,
that's what they want.

38:31.609 --> 38:34.578
Me and you will just be
two single girls and have fun.

38:34.645 --> 38:35.913
Come on then, let's go.

38:40.885 --> 38:44.789
Chloe is always there for us and she
cheers us up when I need her most.

38:44.855 --> 38:46.924
She's a legend
and I love her to bits.

38:52.863 --> 38:55.399
We all know that Marnie
acted like a dick,

38:55.466 --> 38:58.969
but Aaron really loved her and
this breakup is gonna hit him hard.

39:19.290 --> 39:22.326
Chloe's ran away with Marnie,
she's the fucking problem.

39:22.393 --> 39:26.030
She's the one that's ruined
mine and Marnie's relationship.

39:29.467 --> 39:32.603
Chloe's not available.
She's too busy slut dropping.

39:32.670 --> 39:35.940
If I know Marnie, she's just
trying to hide how gutted she is.

39:36.006 --> 39:39.410
Because she sees it as a weakness
if she shows she actually cares.

39:39.477 --> 39:41.011
Bye-bye. Declined.

39:42.413 --> 39:45.449
I can't be arsed with this.
Let's get the fuck home.

39:57.361 --> 39:58.429
Careful!
(shouts)

39:58.496 --> 39:59.463
Aah!

40:01.832 --> 40:05.836
I love you. No, I love you, chicken.
You make us happy.

40:10.207 --> 40:14.145
Tonight has been absolutely fucked.
All I want is this night to be over.

40:14.211 --> 40:15.679
So I'm going to bed.

40:16.413 --> 40:19.450
What happened with you and Aaron?
He made his decision.

40:19.517 --> 40:22.052
He chose Martin over me.

40:22.119 --> 40:24.488
Know what I don't like?
What?

40:25.189 --> 40:27.057
What?

40:27.124 --> 40:30.861
What don't you like? I don't like
when people try and use Chloe

40:30.928 --> 40:32.963
as an excuse to start arguments.

40:33.030 --> 40:34.398
I can't stand Martin.

40:34.465 --> 40:37.735
He's the one who causes all
the trouble, he's a shit-stirrer.

40:37.802 --> 40:38.803
I hate him.

40:38.869 --> 40:41.806
I will argue with you
till I'm black and blue in the face.

40:41.872 --> 40:45.442
Trust me, I've got more control
over my temper than you think.

40:45.509 --> 40:48.946
Every time I'm by myself,
Marnie tries to start on us.

40:49.013 --> 40:52.416
But I know she's only angry
cos Aaron's binned her clean off.

40:52.483 --> 40:55.486
I don't like you, I don't like you
and I don't like you.

40:55.553 --> 40:57.454
Fuck off! I'll fuck off.

40:57.521 --> 41:00.024
Who else wants some? Come on.
Anyone?

41:00.090 --> 41:02.560
Have a good night.
No-one likes you.

41:02.626 --> 41:06.263
(all shouting at once)

41:07.398 --> 41:09.500
Fuck off!

41:09.567 --> 41:11.869
No-one cares!

41:11.936 --> 41:15.105
Where's your friends? Cos I've
got mine. They've left you.

41:17.208 --> 41:20.811
How fucking dare he.
He knows how much I like him,

41:20.878 --> 41:23.080
and for him to call me that
is disgusting.

41:23.147 --> 41:26.217
Why the fuck did I just say that?
That was a step too far.

41:26.283 --> 41:29.320
All them backed us into a corner
and it just slipped out.

41:29.386 --> 41:30.454
Fuck off!

41:30.521 --> 41:33.858
This happens when I get on the
defensive, I say stupid things.

41:33.924 --> 41:36.694
I know I can't take it back,
but I really wish I could.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.697
Marty is being a little prick.
It's becoming clear now

41:39.763 --> 41:42.399
who the problem is,
Marty and not Chloe.

41:42.466 --> 41:44.335
And the boys need to realise that.

41:44.401 --> 41:46.503
(sobs)

41:49.039 --> 41:50.841
I don't feel confident any more.

41:50.908 --> 41:52.843
Like, he's made us feel very small.

41:52.910 --> 41:56.413
No boy has ever made us feel
this insecure about myself.

41:56.480 --> 41:58.916
(sobs)

41:59.984 --> 42:03.520
How could he make me feel
so insecure?

42:05.756 --> 42:08.726
I think he gets to us so much
cos I like him so much.

42:08.792 --> 42:11.161
I used to think I was actually
good looking,

42:11.228 --> 42:13.364
and now I just feel so ugly
all the time.

42:13.430 --> 42:15.966
How could you make someone
feel so worthless?

42:16.033 --> 42:19.069
You're disgusting. (sobs)

42:19.136 --> 42:23.007
I've always wanted to be with him,
but I feel like I'm not good enough.

42:23.841 --> 42:26.577
How could I like someone
who's that nasty?

42:26.644 --> 42:28.045
Lads are pathetic.

42:28.112 --> 42:31.949
they're so far up each other's arses,
they're losing friends like Chloe

42:32.016 --> 42:33.684
and girlfriends like me.

42:33.751 --> 42:35.753
(sobs)

42:38.255 --> 42:41.258
You are pretty.
Everyone knows you're pretty.

42:41.325 --> 42:42.960
(sobs)

42:43.994 --> 42:45.863
Hello?
"Hello, Chloe."

42:45.930 --> 42:48.265
Oh, fuck.
It's that slave-driver, Anna.

42:48.332 --> 42:50.334
(yells)

42:50.401 --> 42:53.504
(cheers) I know for a fact
she still wants to fuck me.

42:54.805 --> 42:58.208
Oh, my God. That is one hairy hole.

42:58.275 --> 42:59.944
Go!
Ah! Fuck.

43:00.010 --> 43:01.145
Shots, shots, shots.

43:02.746 --> 43:06.684
I'm ready to explode, I can feel it.
It's not gonna be fucking pretty.

43:06.750 --> 43:10.988
I will never talk to you again.
I've never seen them like this.

43:11.055 --> 43:13.324
Sometimes love is not enough.

43:14.325 --> 43:15.693
(screams)

43:15.759 --> 43:19.163
There's piss dripping off your head.
Has he passed out?

43:19.229 --> 43:21.799
Oh, my God. I think Kyle's dead.
Kyle!

43:47.424 --> 43:47.624
.
