01:39.900 --> 01:42.892
<i>Hey, man, you got a dollar?
You got a dollar, man?</i>

01:48.075 --> 01:49.440
See you later.

04:32.222 --> 04:33.883
<i>Higgins, you have my word on it,</i>

04:33.957 --> 04:36.357
<i>my absolute solemn promise,</i>

04:36.794 --> 04:39.456
that the wine cellar
thermostat will be checked

04:39.530 --> 04:41.760
and double-checked
and triple-checked

04:41.832 --> 04:43.299
on a daily basis.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.892
Twice daily will be
quite sufficient.

04:47.204 --> 04:50.571
Will you stop worrying? You've been
going on this junket for five years now...

04:50.641 --> 04:54.372
<i>The annual meeting of poets, playwrights,
editors, essayists, and novelists</i>

04:54.445 --> 04:55.912
can hardly be called a junket.

04:55.979 --> 04:57.708
<i>For five years now, and not once</i>

04:57.781 --> 05:00.682
has there ever been a
serious problem at the estate.

05:00.751 --> 05:04.448
Unless you consider the time
it nearly went up in flames.

05:04.588 --> 05:07.887
The only thing that went up in flames
was Rick's vodka teriyaki sauce.

05:07.958 --> 05:10.586
Only a man with your predilection
for Maui chips and beer

05:10.661 --> 05:13.653
could refer to Rick's
inedible sauce as teriyaki.

05:15.065 --> 05:17.192
<i>I think it's a wonderful thing
you're doing for the lads,</i>

05:17.267 --> 05:18.564
taking them
on your trip to Maui.

05:18.635 --> 05:21.160
And thereby relieving you of the
responsibility for their care.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.762
I knew you would appreciate
the gesture.

05:22.840 --> 05:25.331
<i>Higgins, I am not going to
let you ruin my good mood.</i>

05:25.409 --> 05:29.311
Have a safe trip. And don't worry.
Everything will be fine here.

05:33.517 --> 05:36.884
<i>Correct me if I'm wrong, but
isn't this the week of your...</i>

05:36.954 --> 05:40.481
<i>Don't! Don't!
Don't say it. No, please.</i>

05:40.557 --> 05:42.024
Don't say it.

05:45.195 --> 05:46.992
You don't want to
miss your plane.

05:47.064 --> 05:48.827
<i>Good luck, Magnum.</i>

05:55.072 --> 05:56.937
<i>Last chance, Thomas.
You coming with us or not?</i>

05:57.007 --> 05:59.532
<i>I told you. I can't. Leave
the man alone, Orville.</i>

05:59.610 --> 06:01.874
<i>While we're on Lanai, with
the whole island to ourselves,</i>

06:01.945 --> 06:04.413
<i>he'll be in the wine cellar,
babysitting a thermostat.</i>

06:05.315 --> 06:08.079
The only thing
I'll be babysitting is my...

06:13.423 --> 06:15.391
I can't say it.
Say what?

06:15.459 --> 06:17.984
Never mind. I don't want to talk about it.

06:18.061 --> 06:20.052
I'm telling you it's the
Fourth of July weekend.

06:20.130 --> 06:23.896
He always gets like this. This has
nothing to do with the Fourth of July.

06:24.835 --> 06:26.132
Wait a minute.

06:28.205 --> 06:31.333
<i>Isn't this the week of
your... Don't say it, please!</i>

06:31.808 --> 06:34.777
I just don't want to hear
it out loud. Hear what?

06:39.783 --> 06:41.444
<i>Good luck, Thomas.</i>

06:41.518 --> 06:43.349
Just don't let 'em
wear you down.

06:44.755 --> 06:46.222
Thanks.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.142
Tax audit!

07:13.383 --> 07:15.044
<i>There, I said it.</i>

07:17.754 --> 07:20.086
<i>I once had
a paper route in Tidewater.</i>

07:20.157 --> 07:21.852
The Daily Sentinel.

07:21.925 --> 07:25.224
<i>It was my first regular job.
I made $12 a week</i>

07:25.295 --> 07:27.354
<i>and a penny for every
delivered paper.</i>

07:27.431 --> 07:29.558
<i>And I never got nervous
at income tax time</i>

07:29.633 --> 07:32.864
<i>because I knew the IRS
always gave me my money back.</i>

07:33.136 --> 07:34.626
<i>Reluctantly.</i>

07:36.873 --> 07:38.500
<i>Sending in your 1040 form</i>

07:38.575 --> 07:41.066
<i>has always been as much a part
of the American way of life</i>

07:41.144 --> 07:44.443
<i>as hot dogs at the ballpark
on the Fourth of July.</i>

07:44.514 --> 07:49.281
<i>Only now I found myself having
to file a lot more than a 1040,</i>

07:49.519 --> 07:51.714
<i>I wasn't getting
my money back anymore,</i>

07:51.788 --> 07:54.780
<i>and I hadn't been to the
ballpark on the Fourth since...</i>

07:54.858 --> 07:57.088
<i>Well, since before
the paper route.</i>

07:57.160 --> 07:59.594
<i>I told myself
not to feel persecuted.</i>

07:59.663 --> 08:03.224
<i>I told myself that people who
get audited are chosen at random.</i>

08:04.468 --> 08:06.595
<i>I told myself
it was nothing personal.</i>

08:06.670 --> 08:09.002
I knew it.
They're out to get me.

08:09.740 --> 08:11.298
<i>Thomas, no one's out to get you.</i>

08:11.375 --> 08:14.310
I have to go through
my entire case file

08:14.378 --> 08:17.609
to see if I can figure out which
client goes with which receipt.

08:17.681 --> 08:20.081
They just want a proper accounting
of all your business expenses.

08:20.150 --> 08:21.583
<i>Yeah, well,
that could take days.</i>

08:21.652 --> 08:23.313
<i>They're not paying me
for my time, you know.</i>

08:23.387 --> 08:26.550
<i>Well, from what I can see,
no one else is, either.</i>

08:29.159 --> 08:31.593
<i>It'll just take a few days,
at the most.</i>

08:33.697 --> 08:35.857
<i>Well, just so we're through
by the Fourth.</i>

08:35.932 --> 08:38.162
That's all I care about.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.501
<i>Hello?
Is this Thomas Magnum?</i>

08:42.105 --> 08:43.265
Yes.

08:43.340 --> 08:47.003
Then you should say so when you answer
your phone. It's more professional.

08:48.612 --> 08:50.204
<i>Uh, who is this?</i>

08:50.781 --> 08:52.544
<i>I haven't been christened yet.</i>

08:53.150 --> 08:55.243
I'm waiting
for the press to do that.

08:55.318 --> 08:57.752
<i>Look, I'm real busy here.</i>

08:57.888 --> 09:00.379
<i>Not as busy
as you're going to be.</i>

09:00.691 --> 09:04.650
<i>"Rub-a-dub-dub,
three men in a tub,".</i>

09:04.728 --> 09:07.322
<i>"And who do you
think they be?"</i>

09:09.666 --> 09:10.963
What was that about?

09:11.034 --> 09:13.525
<i>Somebody's idea of a joke.
Now, where were we?</i>

09:13.603 --> 09:15.571
We were discussing
your fiscal timetable.

09:15.639 --> 09:18.437
And I'd like to know where
the dinner you owe me fits in.

09:18.508 --> 09:20.999
<i>Well, any time after
the weekend of the Fourth.</i>

09:22.512 --> 09:25.037
And any place you wanna go.

09:25.482 --> 09:28.508
Don't worry.
I'll be reasonable.

09:32.889 --> 09:34.186
Hello?

09:35.125 --> 09:37.286
<i>You tried to kill Phillipe,</i>

09:41.198 --> 09:43.564
<i>and then he killed LaBoule,</i>

09:43.767 --> 09:45.962
<i>one and the same,
he knew they were,</i>

09:46.036 --> 09:47.936
<i>for Magnum is no fool.</i>

09:49.606 --> 09:51.130
<i>Phillipe, come on!</i>

09:51.208 --> 09:52.766
I'll never make it. Go!

09:52.843 --> 09:54.037
No!

09:57.948 --> 09:59.677
What's the matter?

10:00.751 --> 10:02.719
Cat got your tongue?

10:04.488 --> 10:06.251
Who are you?
What do you want?

10:07.491 --> 10:10.085
<i>"Rub-a-dub-dub,"</i>

10:11.394 --> 10:13.555
<i>"three men in a tub,"</i>

10:14.397 --> 10:17.662
<i>"and who do you think
they be?"</i>

10:18.502 --> 10:20.834
Just say what you gotta say!

10:21.171 --> 10:23.071
<i>"The butcher, the baker,"</i>

10:25.108 --> 10:27.872
<i>"the candlestick maker,".</i>

10:29.079 --> 10:31.047
<i>"Turn them out,"</i>

10:31.681 --> 10:34.172
"knaves all three."

10:35.051 --> 10:37.576
<i>If this is some kind of game,
I'm not playing.</i>

10:38.455 --> 10:41.947
I guess you'd rather dip your
hands in the blood of a whore

10:42.025 --> 10:43.856
by this time tomorrow.

10:47.264 --> 10:50.324
<i>Look, uh, why don't you
tell me where you are,</i>

10:50.400 --> 10:52.129
I'll call someone for you.

10:52.202 --> 10:55.103
<i>"Three men in a tub."</i>

10:56.072 --> 10:59.974
Find them and you'll find me.

11:00.210 --> 11:01.734
<i>Tonight.</i>

11:18.728 --> 11:20.719
Thomas?

11:24.000 --> 11:27.436
<i>Excuse me a minute, Maggie.
I gotta make a phone call.</i>

11:28.605 --> 11:31.369
<i>Welcome to the club, Magnum.</i>

11:31.842 --> 11:35.005
<i>Wow, we get these kind
of calls all the time.</i>

11:35.078 --> 11:37.979
But thanks for reporting it.
We'll look into it.

11:38.048 --> 11:39.515
Why did I come
all the way down here?

11:39.583 --> 11:41.608
You could've ignored my report on the phone.

11:41.685 --> 11:44.654
But then how would you
have signed it?

11:47.224 --> 11:50.318
<i>I mean, you didn't give
us a name, a location.</i>

11:50.393 --> 11:51.724
Just a nursery rhyme.

11:51.795 --> 11:54.320
And the fact that
I heard pedicab bells.

11:54.397 --> 11:56.388
That puts him in Waikiki
or downtown.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.934
<i>Now, I don't want to tell you
how to do your job, Lieutenant.</i>

11:59.002 --> 12:01.835
<i>But that nursery rhyme,
it's a place to start.</i>

12:02.105 --> 12:05.336
<i>Well, did he say anything
else? Anything at all?</i>

12:06.576 --> 12:10.307
<i>Like "Bah, bah, black sheep,
Have you any wool?"</i>

12:11.815 --> 12:12.975
No.

12:21.091 --> 12:23.321
<i>Leave your name, number
and the time you called</i>

12:23.393 --> 12:26.021
<i>and I'll get back as soon
as I can. Wait for the beep.</i>

12:26.096 --> 12:28.530
Maggie? Come on.
You there?

12:29.699 --> 12:31.929
<i>I hate these things,
they make me nervous.</i>

12:32.002 --> 12:33.526
<i>Uh, hi Maggie.</i>

12:33.603 --> 12:36.071
<i>Uh, I'm sorry
I had to leave today.</i>

12:36.139 --> 12:38.130
<i>I'd like to start an early, uh,</i>

12:38.208 --> 12:41.268
get an early start tomorrow.

12:41.711 --> 12:44.043
<i>Morning, early, thanks.</i>

12:45.415 --> 12:46.780
Fool.

12:53.256 --> 12:56.123
Maggie.
I knew you were there.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.490
<i>Magnum, Lieutenant Page.</i>

12:58.828 --> 13:01.456
<i>I think you'd better
get down here, right away.</i>

13:36.967 --> 13:39.936
Thomas Magnum.
Lieutenant Page sent for me.

13:48.345 --> 13:51.314
The victim's name
was Laura Stiles.

13:51.381 --> 13:52.905
Coming through.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.749
One of her coworkers found her.

14:05.061 --> 14:07.222
You didn't check out my report.

14:07.464 --> 14:08.761
<i>Well, pardon my ignorance,</i>

14:08.832 --> 14:11.426
but what was I supposed to do
with your little nursery rhyme?

14:11.501 --> 14:14.629
<i>"Three men in a tub, the butcher,
the baker, the candlestick maker."</i>

14:33.929 --> 14:36.329
<i>Thomas, maybe we should
do this another day.</i>

14:36.391 --> 14:38.359
No. We have to finish
by the Fourth.

14:38.427 --> 14:40.395
They won't be much longer.
Okay?

14:40.462 --> 14:42.453
We won't be any longer.
The taps are on the phone

14:42.531 --> 14:44.829
and my men
are stationed close by.

14:48.837 --> 14:51.237
<i>Oh, by the way, Magnum,
you're absolutely sure</i>

14:51.306 --> 14:54.537
that this guy didn't say anything
else to you except the nursery rhyme?

14:55.877 --> 14:57.606
<i>Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

15:03.885 --> 15:06.854
<i>Well, let's get back to work.</i>

15:08.724 --> 15:10.521
I'll be right back.

15:17.799 --> 15:19.232
Lieutenant?

15:21.937 --> 15:23.370
<i>Look,</i>

15:24.106 --> 15:26.438
sorry I've had kind of
a short fuse about all this.

15:26.508 --> 15:29.944
<i>Forget it, Magnum. I know
you had plans for this week.</i>

15:30.011 --> 15:31.376
What else?

15:31.880 --> 15:34.405
<i>Well, this may not be
important, but, uh,</i>

15:34.816 --> 15:37.751
Laura Stiles' killer didn't
exactly pick my name out of a hat.

15:37.819 --> 15:40.253
She was a client of mine.
A client?

15:40.722 --> 15:44.089
<i>Yeah, I don't know how this guy knew
about it or why he was calling me, but...</i>

15:44.159 --> 15:46.354
What else are you
holding back on me?

15:47.996 --> 15:49.520
I'll never make it. Go!

15:49.598 --> 15:50.860
No!

15:53.702 --> 15:56.227
There's no connection.
There couldn't be.

15:56.304 --> 15:57.999
<i>I can't force you
to tell me about it,</i>

15:58.073 --> 16:00.064
I'm gonna leave that up to you.

16:00.142 --> 16:02.133
<i>Now, look, you got
the reputation of a guy</i>

16:02.210 --> 16:04.201
who likes to do things
on his own.

16:04.279 --> 16:06.804
<i>Well, stick by the phone
on this one, dude.</i>

16:06.882 --> 16:09.077
It's the only thing we got.

16:56.765 --> 16:58.062
Mr. Magnum?

16:59.534 --> 17:01.468
<i>Oh, I'm press, I'm press.</i>

17:03.271 --> 17:05.704
<i>Jeff Spangler,
International Image!</i>

17:09.511 --> 17:11.604
<i>You know, I wouldn't make
a habit of sneaking in here.</i>

17:11.680 --> 17:13.079
<i>There's usually
a couple of dogs around,</i>

17:13.147 --> 17:15.638
and they take a real
exception to trespassers.

17:15.717 --> 17:18.446
<i>Oh, now, wait a second. I just
want to ask you a few questions.</i>

17:18.520 --> 17:21.079
Why? We haven't had
any alien abductions

17:21.156 --> 17:23.624
<i>or voices from the grave, at
least none that I can think of.</i>

17:23.692 --> 17:25.090
<i>No, but you have had a murder</i>

17:25.160 --> 17:26.525
and you knew about it
in advance.

17:26.595 --> 17:27.925
And the reason you knew about it

17:27.996 --> 17:30.430
is because the killer told
you it was going to happen.

17:33.268 --> 17:34.428
Out.

17:37.005 --> 17:40.270
<i>I'm right, and you know it.
I'm not gonna talk to you.</i>

17:40.442 --> 17:43.138
Tell me about
The Ripper's nursery rhyme.

17:43.311 --> 17:45.779
That's what I'll be
calling him in my story.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.508
You can tell him that
when he calls again.

17:47.582 --> 17:50.050
What makes you think
I'll ever talk to him again?

17:50.118 --> 17:51.676
Thank you.
You've just confirmed

17:51.753 --> 17:54.415
that you did talk to him
at least once.

18:03.098 --> 18:06.226
<i>I don't know how you know
what you think you know,</i>

18:06.301 --> 18:08.292
but I happen to know
a certain police lieutenant

18:08.370 --> 18:10.463
who'd go to great lengths
to find out.

18:10.539 --> 18:13.337
I haven't worried about the cops
since I read the First Amendment.

18:13.408 --> 18:15.706
Don't wrap yourself
in the Bill of Rights with me.

18:15.777 --> 18:17.210
I know what you're doing.

18:17.279 --> 18:19.543
You're trying to keep the
truth from the American public.

18:19.614 --> 18:21.343
<i>Hey, hey, hold it!
Who the hell are you?</i>

18:21.416 --> 18:23.281
<i>Jeff Spangler,
International Image.</i>

18:23.351 --> 18:26.047
<i>Uh, yeah, well I'm afraid I'm
gonna have to see some sort of ID.</i>

18:26.121 --> 18:29.420
<i>Yeah, hey, come on.
Hit me. Hit me again.</i>

18:30.258 --> 18:32.783
<i>Uh, thank you very much,
Mr. Spangler.</i>

18:39.601 --> 18:42.661
Congratulations. You guys
are really on the ball.

18:57.291 --> 18:58.519
Hello?

19:02.624 --> 19:04.319
<i>Hello, is anybody there?</i>

19:10.732 --> 19:14.224
<i>You won't hang up, Magnum.
I know you better than that.</i>

19:40.662 --> 19:42.926
Do that again

19:43.365 --> 19:45.856
and I'll never let you catch me.

19:45.934 --> 19:48.903
I guess you don't know me
as well as you think you do.

19:48.970 --> 19:50.904
<i>Maybe not.</i>

19:51.439 --> 19:53.634
<i>But I do value your opinion.</i>

19:54.376 --> 19:56.139
You're the best there is.

19:58.179 --> 19:59.908
What makes you say that?

20:03.084 --> 20:05.518
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

20:07.288 --> 20:11.384
<i>another Laura and the wine,</i>

20:13.428 --> 20:15.589
<i>you found the truth
for all to see,</i>

20:15.664 --> 20:19.862
a simple case of infidelity.

20:20.869 --> 20:24.703
<i>What?
Great "A", little "A",</i>

20:25.273 --> 20:27.605
<i>bouncing "B",</i>

20:28.710 --> 20:30.769
<i>the cat's in the cupboard,</i>

20:31.946 --> 20:34.141
and she can't see.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.209
Go on.

20:37.786 --> 20:41.347
<i>I know exactly how long it
takes to trace a call, Magnum,</i>

20:41.423 --> 20:43.323
and you're short by

20:44.659 --> 20:46.752
10 seconds.

20:55.103 --> 20:57.128
<i>Did you get that, guys?</i>

21:10.351 --> 21:13.286
<i>I know what you're
thinking, and you're right.</i>

21:16.224 --> 21:19.216
<i>That little nursery rhyme could
have described any number of places.</i>

21:19.294 --> 21:21.091
<i>So why pick this one?</i>

21:23.398 --> 21:25.696
<i>Because I'd been here before.</i>

21:26.067 --> 21:29.366
<i>And just like the corner
where Laura Stiles was killed,</i>

21:29.437 --> 21:31.530
<i>I'd been here on a case.</i>

21:32.540 --> 21:34.531
<i>One more time, Magnum,</i>

21:35.744 --> 21:39.339
<i>"Great 'A', little 'A's"
Analupa and Son.</i>

21:41.082 --> 21:43.573
"Bouncing 'B" ' is Bart's there.

21:44.419 --> 21:45.909
And "the cupboard" is?

21:45.987 --> 21:47.181
"The cupboard" is the alley.

21:47.255 --> 21:49.780
<i>"The cat," that's our killer,
will come from the alley.</i>

21:49.858 --> 21:52.793
"She won't see him" means
the victim won't see him.

21:52.861 --> 21:55.056
And you figured this
all out by yourself.

21:57.398 --> 22:01.960
<i>Experience, Lieutenant. And
cold hard investigative logic.</i>

22:27.428 --> 22:28.793
Hey!

22:45.246 --> 22:47.942
<i>I'm press, I'm press,</i>

22:48.283 --> 22:50.274
<i>Jeff Spangler,
International Image.</i>

23:00.226 --> 23:02.319
<i>Okay, Lieutenant,</i>

23:02.495 --> 23:05.123
let's start with names
and badge numbers.

23:05.198 --> 23:07.928
I have every intention of
swearing out a brutality complaint.

23:08.001 --> 23:09.935
<i>Will you just calm down,
Mr. Spangler? I am gonna take</i>

23:10.003 --> 23:11.402
you and your men to court.

23:11.471 --> 23:13.234
You don't have to let him
talk to you like this.

23:13.306 --> 23:15.274
Why the hell don't you
just stay out of this?

23:15.342 --> 23:16.707
You and your men
moved in too soon.

23:16.776 --> 23:20.872
I will sue the entire state if I
have to. I'll tell you what I want.

23:20.947 --> 23:23.916
I want to know how you happen to be
in the right place at the wrong time.

23:23.983 --> 23:25.575
<i>Sources, that's how.</i>

23:25.652 --> 23:29.315
<i>Magnum, that's enough.
Sources.</i>

23:32.492 --> 23:35.552
<i>You know where I'll be, Page. By the phone.</i>

23:39.966 --> 23:41.433
Shut up.

23:54.047 --> 23:56.447
<i>He tried to kill Phillipe...</i>

23:58.318 --> 23:59.910
I'll never make it. Go!

23:59.986 --> 24:01.146
No!

24:03.456 --> 24:05.686
<i>And then he killed LaBoule.</i>

24:12.499 --> 24:14.433
<i>As you can see, I survived.</i>

24:15.602 --> 24:18.093
<i>One and the same
he knew them to be.</i>

24:19.606 --> 24:21.267
This isn't Nam.

24:25.145 --> 24:26.407
No.

24:30.216 --> 24:31.877
<i>Why didn't you come back for me?</i>

24:41.294 --> 24:43.592
<i>Magnum is no fool.</i>

25:11.357 --> 25:15.418
<i>Bravo, Magnum, bravo!</i>

25:16.162 --> 25:20.121
Your performance last night
was magnificent.

25:21.534 --> 25:24.992
I was watching
the whole wonderful show.

25:25.505 --> 25:27.632
You go to Bart's Tavern a lot?

25:27.707 --> 25:31.165
<i>You're sounding bored, Magnum.</i>

25:31.344 --> 25:32.971
And I know why.

25:34.547 --> 25:39.177
Keystone Kops won't let you
play my game by yourself.

25:40.053 --> 25:42.578
Why don't we play
a different game.

25:42.689 --> 25:44.486
<i>We are.</i>

25:44.924 --> 25:49.054
"Girls and boys come out to play.

25:49.629 --> 25:53.292
<i>"The moon doth shine
as bright as day."</i>

25:53.733 --> 25:56.964
<i>"Come with a whoop
come with a call."</i>

25:57.470 --> 26:00.064
"Come with a good will"

26:01.107 --> 26:03.598
"or don't come at all."

26:21.528 --> 26:24.053
<i>"Girls and boys
come out to play,"</i>

26:27.600 --> 26:30.125
"the moon doth shine
as bright as day."

26:31.571 --> 26:33.163
"Doth shine."

26:51.524 --> 26:54.493
It's only the pizza man.
Who eats pizza for breakfast?

26:55.962 --> 26:58.089
<i>It's open, Kana.</i>

27:05.138 --> 27:07.629
<i>Small pepperoni, Magnum.
Comes to $5.95.</i>

27:08.808 --> 27:11.242
<i>Well, here's $100.</i>

27:11.878 --> 27:13.869
Keep the change.
Say what?

27:13.947 --> 27:15.676
<i>All right, Magnum!</i>

27:43.476 --> 27:44.966
I'm here.

27:46.412 --> 27:48.642
<i>The true hero.</i>

27:49.415 --> 27:53.818
So dedicated to rescuing
all the innocent prostitutes

27:53.886 --> 27:55.478
from the villain's knife.

27:56.556 --> 27:58.683
<i>Why is that, Magnum?</i>

27:59.626 --> 28:01.924
Why is the villain
so dedicated to killing them?

28:01.995 --> 28:04.156
Because they're whores.

28:05.298 --> 28:06.492
All of them.

28:06.566 --> 28:09.865
<i>Liars, cheaters, thieves.</i>

28:10.937 --> 28:12.461
What do you want from me?

28:14.507 --> 28:16.031
Don't you know?

28:17.510 --> 28:20.502
You're supposed to catch me.

28:20.880 --> 28:24.281
<i>You're supposed to stop me</i>

28:24.350 --> 28:28.116
<i>from slicing up number two
and number three.</i>

28:30.556 --> 28:31.921
<i>Well, you blew it.</i>

28:31.991 --> 28:33.959
Number two was supposed
to be last night.

28:37.497 --> 28:42.127
<i>No, no, no, no, no,
Magnum, you blew it.</i>

28:43.369 --> 28:46.497
Number two was last night.

28:49.976 --> 28:51.307
What are you talking about?

28:51.377 --> 28:55.746
<i>And I really think you're
going to love number three.</i>

28:58.184 --> 29:00.709
Riddle me this.

29:01.487 --> 29:05.548
What has four legs
in the morning

29:06.659 --> 29:09.389
<i>and two legs in the afternoon,</i>

29:10.663 --> 29:14.326
<i>and three legs in the evening?</i>

29:15.301 --> 29:16.700
I've heard this.

29:24.177 --> 29:25.644
A man.

29:25.912 --> 29:27.812
The answer's a man.

31:24.564 --> 31:27.761
<i>I was watching
your whole wonderful show.</i>

33:57.049 --> 34:01.611
<i>Once upon a time,
another Laura, and the wine.</i>

34:18.070 --> 34:22.199
<i>Because they're whores,
all of them.</i>

34:22.608 --> 34:27.773
<i>And I really think you're
going to love number three.</i>

34:29.581 --> 34:30.708
A man.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.434
<i>Page.
Page, this is Magnum.</i>

34:51.502 --> 34:52.992
<i>Where the hell are you, Magnum?</i>

34:53.070 --> 34:55.469
Never mind where I am. You
gotta find Jeff Spangler.

34:55.540 --> 34:56.837
I think he's our next victim.

34:56.908 --> 34:58.773
Oh? Why would he
go after Spangler?

34:58.843 --> 35:00.367
All his victims have been women.

35:00.445 --> 35:02.606
But the answer
to the riddle is a man.

35:03.147 --> 35:04.774
What riddle?

35:05.650 --> 35:07.515
<i>Four legs in the morning,
that's a baby,</i>

35:07.585 --> 35:09.052
<i>two in the afternoon
is an adult,</i>

35:09.120 --> 35:11.588
<i>and three in the evening,
that's an old man with a cane.</i>

35:11.656 --> 35:13.954
He's trying to tell us
the next victim is a man.

35:14.025 --> 35:16.926
You haven't answered my
question. Why Spangler?

35:16.994 --> 35:18.393
I'm not sure of all the reasons.

35:18.463 --> 35:20.556
I guess this guy admires me.

35:20.631 --> 35:22.223
Maybe he wants my approval.

35:22.300 --> 35:23.733
He knows I don't like the guy.

35:23.801 --> 35:25.029
<i>Whatever his reason...</i>

35:25.102 --> 35:28.071
Maybe Spangler wants you to
think Spangler's the next victim.

35:28.139 --> 35:29.367
Lieutenant...

35:29.440 --> 35:30.839
Let me read you something.

35:30.908 --> 35:34.036
<i>There's no time! It's a
police psychiatrist's report.</i>

35:34.445 --> 35:37.471
"In cases where the multiple
killer contacts the authorities

35:37.548 --> 35:39.072
<i>"and provides them
with elaborate clues,</i>

35:39.150 --> 35:42.244
<i>"the subject is often
classified as an A-type achiever,</i>

35:42.386 --> 35:45.583
<i>"with high motivation,
crippled by low self-esteem."</i>

35:45.656 --> 35:48.955
<i>"More than anything, the subject
needs recognition for his achievements,"</i>

35:49.026 --> 35:52.052
<i>"for without it, his own
deep feelings of inadequacy"</i>

35:52.129 --> 35:53.323
"are confirmed."

35:53.397 --> 35:56.025
Now doesn't that
sound like Spangler?

35:56.100 --> 35:58.898
<i>No. Well, I've got an APB out on him.</i>

35:58.970 --> 36:01.268
He's not the killer.

36:01.372 --> 36:03.806
<i>Well, that's exactly
what he wants you to think.</i>

36:03.875 --> 36:05.843
<i>Now, if you want to help
with this investigation,</i>

36:05.910 --> 36:09.812
<i>just follow orders and leave the
thinking to us. Thank you, bye-bye.</i>

36:15.586 --> 36:19.522
<i>What has four
legs in the morning,</i>

36:19.857 --> 36:22.917
<i>and two legs in the afternoon</i>

36:23.594 --> 36:27.030
<i>and three legs in the evening?</i>

36:28.099 --> 36:31.660
<i>At the Kapiolani Park War
Memorial Swimming Pool 1982.</i>

36:32.036 --> 36:35.563
<i>Four legs in the morning, the
four individual heats I'd entered.</i>

36:35.640 --> 36:38.700
<i>Two legs in the afternoon,
two legs of a medley relay,</i>

36:38.776 --> 36:40.835
<i>the prelim and the final.</i>

36:40.912 --> 36:44.643
<i>But the event I hadn't counted on
was the three legs in the evening.</i>

36:44.715 --> 36:46.376
<i>The freestyle relay I took over</i>

36:46.450 --> 36:48.782
<i>when one of our teammates
pulled a muscle.</i>

36:48.853 --> 36:52.289
<i>Four legs in the morning,
two legs in the afternoon,</i>

36:52.356 --> 36:54.324
<i>three legs in the evening.</i>

36:54.392 --> 36:57.122
<i>I couldn't move
for a week after that.</i>

38:11.936 --> 38:15.770
<i>Although The Ripper called
for our clandestine meeting,</i>

38:16.374 --> 38:19.434
he has yet to show himself.

39:48.999 --> 39:51.229
You found me.

39:55.172 --> 39:57.367
I knew you'd find me.

39:57.441 --> 39:59.306
Why don't you
put that knife down.

40:00.344 --> 40:02.403
That's not part of the plan.

40:03.147 --> 40:04.375
What is?

40:21.932 --> 40:23.559
It's me.

40:27.738 --> 40:29.433
Surprised?

40:31.542 --> 40:33.169
I don't know you.

40:35.646 --> 40:38.114
<i>Don't play games
with me, Magnum.</i>

40:38.182 --> 40:39.979
Of course you do.

40:40.050 --> 40:41.642
<i>No, I don't.</i>

40:44.054 --> 40:45.919
I really don't.

40:47.758 --> 40:49.589
You have to.

40:58.702 --> 41:00.192
<i>Well, I'm sorry.</i>

41:00.271 --> 41:02.569
I just can't remember every
single face I come across.

41:02.640 --> 41:04.164
Some of them

41:05.776 --> 41:08.244
just aren't that memorable.

41:10.314 --> 41:12.111
You have to remember.

41:13.851 --> 41:15.580
You did me a favor.

41:20.124 --> 41:21.648
Now I'm doing you one.

41:21.725 --> 41:24.785
I'm helping you
get rid of all the scum.

41:24.862 --> 41:26.591
I'm doing this for you.

41:27.565 --> 41:29.999
<i>No, you're doing this
for yourself.</i>

41:30.568 --> 41:32.263
You just wanna
get your face in the paper.

41:32.336 --> 41:34.827
<i>Then people will remember you,
won't they?</i>

41:35.539 --> 41:37.973
Then you won't be
a nobody anymore.

41:41.812 --> 41:44.303
<i>Don't make me hurt you,
too, Magnum.</i>

41:44.782 --> 41:47.080
Why don't you come here and try.

41:47.651 --> 41:50.381
<i>Now, you better shut up now,
or I will.</i>

41:51.589 --> 41:54.114
<i>Then you can put my picture
up in your room,</i>

41:54.725 --> 41:56.192
paint the face all red.

42:00.231 --> 42:03.098
You broke into my room!

42:10.941 --> 42:12.408
<i>Oh, I get it.</i>

42:13.143 --> 42:14.735
I see what you're trying to do.

42:14.812 --> 42:16.837
You're trying to save him.

42:22.152 --> 42:23.915
<i>Well, it won't work.</i>

42:29.393 --> 42:31.020
Don't make me shoot you.

42:34.765 --> 42:37.893
<i>You can't win, Magnum.</i>

42:39.136 --> 42:41.661
<i>If you don't shoot me,</i>

42:42.139 --> 42:43.936
<i>he dies,</i>

42:44.608 --> 42:46.439
and I win.

42:48.112 --> 42:50.410
<i>If you do shoot me,</i>

42:56.520 --> 42:58.147
I still win.

43:00.791 --> 43:02.190
Don't do it.

43:59.316 --> 44:01.216
How did you know about LaBoule?

44:05.622 --> 44:08.113
"A wise old owl lived in an oak."

44:08.926 --> 44:11.895
"The more he saw
the less he spoke."

44:13.230 --> 44:17.394
"The less he spoke
the more he heard."

44:19.636 --> 44:22.434
"Why can't we all be
like that wise old bird?"

45:15.392 --> 45:18.088
One shot.
You got him with one shot.

45:18.162 --> 45:19.720
This is it.

45:19.897 --> 45:23.697
This is my ticket.
My move to a real paper.

45:24.401 --> 45:26.335
<i>My own byline, maybe.</i>

45:26.403 --> 45:28.803
<i>It's goodbye, Atlanta,
hello, Hawaii.</i>

45:29.773 --> 45:32.003
<i>Just do me one favor, Spangler.</i>

45:33.177 --> 45:35.270
You saved my life.
Name it.

45:35.512 --> 45:37.377
Don't mention my name.

45:41.585 --> 45:43.815
<i>You've got my word on it,
Magnum.</i>

45:55.099 --> 45:56.657
<i>Milton Collins.</i>

45:56.733 --> 46:00.100
<i>Even after I heard his name,
I still couldn't remember him.</i>

46:00.170 --> 46:02.502
<i>I didn't have a record of him
in my case file.</i>

46:02.573 --> 46:05.667
<i>But something did show up
in my appointment book.</i>

46:06.143 --> 46:09.271
<i>I'd had a meeting at the club
one day with a Milton Collins</i>

46:09.346 --> 46:11.974
<i>who wanted to know if his
wife was cheating on him.</i>

46:12.116 --> 46:13.947
<i>I only had to tail her
once to find out</i>

46:14.017 --> 46:15.507
<i>the guy he thought
she was seeing</i>

46:15.586 --> 46:18.919
<i>was only painting a portrait
of her for their anniversary.</i>

46:19.089 --> 46:22.388
<i>It was so easy I couldn't
even take his money.</i>

46:23.560 --> 46:27.087
<i>That must have been the favor
he thought I had done for him.</i>

46:27.397 --> 46:30.332
<i>And then I forgot
all about Milton Collins.</i>

46:30.400 --> 46:32.891
<i>I guess he felt
a lot of people did.</i>

46:33.003 --> 46:35.471
<i>And maybe he felt he had
to do something about that.</i>

46:35.539 --> 46:37.006
<i>I don't know.</i>

46:37.541 --> 46:39.065
<i>I guess that's what
bothered me most,</i>

46:39.143 --> 46:42.112
<i>I'd never know why.
Why he killed.</i>

46:42.346 --> 46:44.314
<i>How he knew about Phillipe.</i>

46:44.381 --> 46:46.372
<i>Maggie found out that he was stationed in Nam</i>

46:46.450 --> 46:49.749
<i>at the same time I was, but
so were a lot of other guys.</i>

46:50.287 --> 46:52.084
<i>I guess he was right.</i>

46:52.356 --> 46:55.348
<i>At least in his mind,
he did still win.</i>

46:55.726 --> 46:58.456
<i>He died with all the secrets.</i>

46:58.729 --> 47:01.493
<i>It wasn't the first time
I'd had to accept</i>

47:01.565 --> 47:03.863
<i>that sometimes
there were no answers.</i>

47:03.967 --> 47:05.798
<i>I don't know why
I started feeling the need</i>

47:05.869 --> 47:08.167
<i>to be by myself
on the Fourth of July</i>

47:08.338 --> 47:10.101
<i>the day my dad died.</i>

47:10.541 --> 47:13.601
<i>Or why I still feel
the need to this day.</i>

47:13.677 --> 47:15.042
<i>I just do.</i>
