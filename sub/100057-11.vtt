WEBVTT

00:02.703 --> 00:03.998
Any news? Are you pregnant?

00:04.022 --> 00:06.170
I don't know. I just peed.

00:06.195 --> 00:07.203
On a stick?

00:07.228 --> 00:10.748
No, in the toilet and
a little on the seat.

00:10.773 --> 00:13.632
Okay, look, the minute I take that test,

00:13.657 --> 00:15.585
our lives are gonna change forever.

00:15.610 --> 00:18.632
So I just wanna put that
off for a little while

00:18.657 --> 00:20.359
and enjoy my life the way it is.

00:20.384 --> 00:21.532
You don't need to take a test.

00:21.556 --> 00:24.632
I can feel it in my bones
that my bone did the job.

00:24.657 --> 00:25.968
Oh, Wayne.

00:26.840 --> 00:29.671
Man, you weren't
kidding about that seat.

00:32.180 --> 00:34.781
Got more donations for
the rummage sale Saturday.

00:34.806 --> 00:37.575
Ooh, I hope there's
something good in there.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.368
If it's another severed doll head,
I'm gonna scream.

00:39.392 --> 00:41.109
There's just not a
market for them anymore.

00:41.134 --> 00:43.242
Yeah, who would pay a quarter for this?

00:43.267 --> 00:44.382
That's mine.

00:44.407 --> 00:46.328
Okay, uh, you're late.

00:46.353 --> 00:47.546
What? How do you know?

00:47.571 --> 00:49.838
Uh, 'cause clocks?

00:49.863 --> 00:51.117
Let's get started.

00:51.142 --> 00:52.835
- Please?
- Oh, baby.

00:52.860 --> 00:54.844
What's he doing here?
I don't do children's choirs.

00:54.868 --> 00:57.202
I was hoping he could get
a little singing practice.

00:57.227 --> 00:59.976
Yeah, I'm gonna compete
in the Conley Fork's Finest pageant.

01:00.001 --> 01:01.296
Ah, "finest."

01:01.321 --> 01:02.500
Perfect word to use

01:02.525 --> 01:04.375
when excellence is out of reach.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.992
It's your traditional teen boy pageant

01:07.017 --> 01:09.484
that was forced to
allow girls to compete.

01:09.509 --> 01:11.368
I have a really good chance
at winning this year.

01:11.392 --> 01:12.921
Just don't get your hopes up too high.

01:12.946 --> 01:13.954
You definitely deserve it.

01:13.978 --> 01:16.906
It's just that the most deserving
person doesn't always win.

01:16.931 --> 01:18.616
Don't discourage him.

01:18.641 --> 01:20.179
Anything is possible.

01:20.204 --> 01:22.789
You reach for the stars,
and you might not get 'em,

01:22.814 --> 01:25.415
but at least you won't end
up with a handful of mud.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.640
That cannot be what you meant.

01:27.665 --> 01:29.932
Uh, now, Wayne does have a point.

01:29.957 --> 01:31.656
Winner is always some kid who grew up

01:31.681 --> 01:32.949
with a silver spoon in his mouth.

01:32.973 --> 01:35.292
Yeah. Only plastic spoons for us, baby.

01:35.317 --> 01:37.487
Ooh, I wonder who got
the golden invitation

01:37.512 --> 01:38.784
to be a judge this year.

01:38.809 --> 01:41.673
Wait, did you say "golden invitation"?

01:41.698 --> 01:43.752
- I got one yesterday.
- Where is it?

01:43.777 --> 01:45.190
How do they know where you live?

01:46.588 --> 01:49.304
Synced & corrected by QueenMaddie
www.addic7ed.com

01:58.004 --> 01:59.471
How could you throw it away?

01:59.496 --> 02:00.940
I thought it was a jury summons.

02:00.965 --> 02:02.510
But it's on gold paper.

02:02.535 --> 02:03.964
Well, I thought they were
trying to impress me.

02:03.988 --> 02:05.698
Also, you can't throw
away a jury summons.

02:05.723 --> 02:07.838
Is there anything good for
the church rummage sale?

02:07.863 --> 02:10.721
You know what they say.
One man's trash is another man's...

02:10.746 --> 02:12.534
It's just so many toenail clippings.

02:12.559 --> 02:14.081
How many toes do you have?

02:14.106 --> 02:15.106
Found it!

02:15.112 --> 02:16.684
Oh, baby, you didn't think twice

02:16.709 --> 02:18.776
about pulling something
gross out of the garbage.

02:18.801 --> 02:19.900
I worry that's on me.

02:19.925 --> 02:21.129
"Dear Dr. Cochran,

02:21.154 --> 02:23.184
"we cordially invite
you to serve as a judge

02:23.209 --> 02:26.844
"for the 57th annual Conley
Fork's Finest pageant.

02:26.869 --> 02:28.886
"We are impressed by
your advanced degrees

02:28.911 --> 02:29.944
and impressive career"...

02:29.946 --> 02:32.270
They said "impressed" twice,
but I don't mind.

02:32.295 --> 02:34.473
... "but mostly because you're
the only person in town

02:34.498 --> 02:36.457
"to have your own Wikipedia page.

02:36.482 --> 02:37.793
Wow."

02:37.818 --> 02:39.488
That's their "wow," not mine.

02:39.513 --> 02:41.590
But I do agree.
It's pretty gosh darn cool.

02:41.615 --> 02:44.833
Oh, great. Another elitist snob
on the judging panel.

02:44.858 --> 02:46.571
I grew up just like you, but

02:46.596 --> 02:48.521
with a less stupid accent.

02:48.546 --> 02:50.263
But I made it to the top of my field.

02:50.288 --> 02:51.816
I... I believe in people

02:51.841 --> 02:54.008
pulling themselves up
by their bootstraps.

02:54.033 --> 02:55.532
I think you mean "boob-straps."

02:55.557 --> 02:57.349
I absolutely do not.

02:57.374 --> 02:58.974
See? With Arthur as a judge,

02:58.999 --> 03:00.537
Cash definitely has a chance.

03:00.562 --> 03:02.482
Now, if I do this,
I have to be impartial.

03:02.507 --> 03:04.881
Cash gets no preferential treatment.

03:04.906 --> 03:07.670
Well, you may not be able
to be swayed by Cash...

03:07.695 --> 03:08.695
No, no, no.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.553
But maybe you can be swayed by...

03:10.578 --> 03:11.646
Cash!

03:11.671 --> 03:13.553
- Ooh!
- Look how cute he is.

03:13.578 --> 03:15.145
- Ooh!

03:35.491 --> 03:36.818
Blake Lake, Jr.

03:36.843 --> 03:38.405
Yeah, he doesn't know
what's gonna hit him.

03:38.429 --> 03:40.420
You know that Blake Lake, Jr.
kid is gonna win.

03:40.445 --> 03:42.373
Someone from his family wins every year.

03:42.398 --> 03:44.451
Will you just let Cash enjoy this?

03:44.476 --> 03:46.358
This might be the last time
he has in the spotlight

03:46.382 --> 03:47.681
before the new baby comes,

03:47.706 --> 03:49.139
and then he has to play second fiddle.

03:49.163 --> 03:51.131
That's why I killed my twin in the womb.

These fine young boys
and girl are competing

04:10.880 --> 04:15.416
to find out who is Conley Fork's finest.

04:15.418 --> 04:17.786
Let's meet our distinguished judges,
shall we?

04:17.812 --> 04:19.445
Belinda Sue Walton.

04:19.470 --> 04:20.724
She's a beauty consultant

04:20.749 --> 04:23.067
and University of Kentucky applicant.

04:23.311 --> 04:25.113
Thank you.

04:27.953 --> 04:32.129
Podcaster and former winner
of this very pageant,

04:32.154 --> 04:34.979
Mr. Torsten VanBlaricum.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.349
Cherish this time, boys and girl.

04:37.373 --> 04:38.373
Cherish it.

04:38.398 --> 04:40.060
And famous choir director,

04:40.085 --> 04:41.849
Mr. Arthur Cochran.

04:41.874 --> 04:44.589
- "Doctor."
- Deliver a baby and we'll talk.

04:48.257 --> 04:49.553
This is a great choice.

04:49.578 --> 04:50.671
It'll go great with that sweater.

04:50.695 --> 04:52.146
Just don't wear it to church, okay?

04:52.171 --> 04:53.592
Okay.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.248
You ready to run our play?

04:55.273 --> 04:57.177
Are we sure we wanna
capitalize on the rumor

04:57.202 --> 04:59.342
that you, uh, allegedly...

04:59.367 --> 05:01.162
Murdered my husband? Why not?

05:01.187 --> 05:03.487
It keep the brunches and
the group texts at bay.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.512
And it helps the church make some money.

05:05.537 --> 05:07.404
Good, because Ms. Mae over there

05:07.429 --> 05:09.747
never misses an episode of "Dateline."

05:11.587 --> 05:13.720
Are you still taking donations?

05:13.745 --> 05:15.701
I'd like to get rid of this old hammer.

05:15.726 --> 05:18.861
Only used once and
wiped clean afterward.

05:18.886 --> 05:21.396
I'll give you $40 for that.

05:21.421 --> 05:23.607
$50 if it's still got her fingerprints.

05:23.632 --> 05:24.862
$60 and you have a deal.

05:28.218 --> 05:31.052
It's an honor to shape
young minds, isn't it?

05:31.077 --> 05:33.420
Forget about minds.
It's strength that matters.

05:33.445 --> 05:35.740
Who can withstand torture or probing?

05:35.765 --> 05:37.436
- Probing?
- It's when you stick something up...

05:37.460 --> 05:38.492
Yeah, yeah, I know...

05:38.517 --> 05:40.513
I know what probing is.

05:40.538 --> 05:42.186
What does... what does
that have to do with this?

05:42.210 --> 05:45.582
In 1963, Americans went to outer space.

05:45.607 --> 05:48.256
Well, in Conley Fork, we asked,

05:48.281 --> 05:50.588
"What if space came to us?"

05:50.613 --> 05:53.623
In case of an alien landing,
we needed a representative

05:53.648 --> 05:55.481
to greet the extraterrestrials,

05:55.506 --> 05:58.541
hence Conley Fork's Finest.

05:59.742 --> 06:02.599
So the plan is to send a child

06:02.624 --> 06:04.443
to confront the alien invasion?

06:04.468 --> 06:05.474
They're less threatening.

06:05.499 --> 06:08.256
Of course,
no one still believes that stuff.

06:08.764 --> 06:10.521
During the interview round,

06:10.546 --> 06:13.388
the contestants will
be asked the question,

06:13.413 --> 06:16.529
"Why should the aliens
spare Conley Fork?"

06:16.554 --> 06:18.810
Thank you for that excellent question.

06:18.835 --> 06:20.982
What kind of aliens
are we talking about?

06:21.007 --> 06:22.840
Look how we've destroyed
the environment.

06:22.865 --> 06:24.765
Do we even deserve to be spared?

06:24.790 --> 06:26.982
I'd like to answer in dance.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.810
... fertile soil is rich in nitrogen,

06:31.835 --> 06:34.069
which is essential to most life-forms.

06:35.663 --> 06:38.185
And they're gonna be like,
"We come in peace."

06:38.210 --> 06:39.710
And I'm gonna be like...

06:40.499 --> 06:41.827
"You're gonna have to go through me."

06:41.851 --> 06:43.732
All right! That is my son!

06:43.757 --> 06:45.724
Blast 'em back to hell, sweetie!

06:47.695 --> 06:50.217
I know Jesus would give
a stranger the shirt off his back,

06:50.242 --> 06:51.935
but this one's not for sale.

06:52.181 --> 06:53.181
You know what?

06:53.206 --> 06:56.092
Good enough for Jesus;
good enough for me.

06:56.828 --> 06:58.998
Karl, what are you doing here?

06:59.023 --> 07:01.693
Other than making me fight
impure thoughts in a church?

07:01.718 --> 07:04.920
I got a guy who wants to
buy your husband's necktie.

07:04.945 --> 07:07.318
Now, he's offered $10,
but I think I can get $20

07:07.343 --> 07:09.224
if I imply you strangled him with it.

07:09.249 --> 07:10.482
- What?
- You know.

07:10.515 --> 07:13.334
The whole "Adams murdered
her husband" thing.

07:13.359 --> 07:17.381
No, I don't know about
the husband or the murder.

07:17.406 --> 07:20.539
Oh, well, just forget I said anything.

07:22.419 --> 07:24.217
I was previously married.

07:24.242 --> 07:26.373
Oh, I gathered. Yeah.

07:26.398 --> 07:27.413
How's he doing these days?

07:27.437 --> 07:29.137
Oh, he's good.

07:29.162 --> 07:30.256
He's dead.

07:31.349 --> 07:33.279
Oh, man, this is more nerve-racking

07:33.304 --> 07:34.959
than a DUI checkpoint.

07:35.645 --> 07:37.404
Cash'll be crushed if he loses.

07:37.429 --> 07:38.494
Would you relax?

07:38.519 --> 07:40.331
Cash is doing great,

07:40.356 --> 07:42.717
and Arthur is a beacon
of fairness and reason.

07:42.742 --> 07:44.388
It says so in his email signature.

07:44.413 --> 07:46.951
Here are the scores
from our first round.

07:46.976 --> 07:49.577
First up, Cassius Clay Hawlings.

07:49.602 --> 07:52.510
Ms. Belinda Sue Walton...

07:52.535 --> 07:54.535
Mr. VanBlaricum...

07:54.537 --> 07:56.990
and Mr. Dr. Cochran.

07:57.015 --> 07:59.315
- He gave Cash a six?
- He gave Cash a six!

07:59.498 --> 08:00.974
I mean, boo!

08:00.999 --> 08:02.553
You're a six!

08:02.578 --> 08:05.771
Not you or you but you, Arthur!

08:05.796 --> 08:07.496
You're actually a four.

08:09.045 --> 08:10.911
How could you give Cash a six?

08:10.936 --> 08:12.559
I know the scale is one to ten,

08:12.584 --> 08:14.912
but they said six was
the lowest we could go

08:14.937 --> 08:16.270
without making the kids cry.

08:16.295 --> 08:18.061
I thought you said you
were gonna be fair.

08:18.086 --> 08:19.717
I thought this was based on merit.

08:19.742 --> 08:21.175
Well, if it was based on merit,

08:21.200 --> 08:22.288
he would have gotten a three.

08:22.312 --> 08:25.746
Cash wants this so badly,
and he spoke from the heart.

08:25.771 --> 08:27.438
Shouldn't that be enough?

08:27.463 --> 08:30.482
I mean, why would anyone
bring a child into a world

08:30.507 --> 08:32.013
that doesn't reward heart-speaking?

08:32.038 --> 08:35.388
You had me at, "Why would anyone
bring a child into the world?"

08:39.496 --> 08:41.062
A few years ago,

08:41.087 --> 08:43.131
my husband, Keith,
went on a fishing trip,

08:43.155 --> 08:44.365
and he didn't come back.

08:44.390 --> 08:47.803
So now everyone in town
assumes I killed him

08:47.828 --> 08:49.224
and fed his body to the catfish.

08:49.249 --> 08:50.709
Blah, blah, blah.

08:50.734 --> 08:52.779
I don't understand how
you can joke about this.

08:52.804 --> 08:55.209
It's not a joke. Catfish are carnivores.

08:55.234 --> 08:57.170
That'd be how I did it...

08:57.195 --> 08:58.327
If I'd done it...

08:58.352 --> 08:59.685
which I didn't.

08:59.710 --> 09:01.210
Or did I?

09:01.235 --> 09:02.279
I didn't.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.560
I don't know what this game is,

09:05.585 --> 09:07.990
but I want a relationship
where we can talk.

09:08.482 --> 09:09.959
So call me when you're ready.

09:14.609 --> 09:17.342
Uh, this might be a bad time,

09:17.367 --> 09:20.662
but there's a guy that'll
give the church 20 bucks

09:20.687 --> 09:25.428
if you pose for a selfie with
him and a roll of duct tape.

09:25.453 --> 09:27.490
Gimme that duct tape.

success goes to his head

09:48.288 --> 09:50.342
and then he turns to drugs and alcohol?

10:44.132 --> 10:45.803

- Wow!

10:45.828 --> 10:47.732
He just made that up?

10:47.757 --> 10:49.304
It's so good.

10:53.880 --> 10:56.404
Eight? Did you hear that voice?

10:56.429 --> 10:58.646
I need to leave some room in
case anyone else is better.

10:58.671 --> 11:01.381
Well, I don't... I don't see
how anybody could be better.

11:17.835 --> 11:18.951
I-I'm embarrassed

11:18.976 --> 11:21.060
for the person I was 45 seconds ago.

11:21.085 --> 11:22.373
That kid is much better.

11:27.843 --> 11:29.810
Cash, baby, what are you doing out here?

11:29.835 --> 11:31.271
The next round's gonna start soon.

11:31.296 --> 11:32.495
Unless...

11:32.520 --> 11:34.796
Are you entering from the audience
like "The Price Is Right"?

11:34.820 --> 11:36.754
What? No, Dad.

11:36.888 --> 11:38.560
Blake Lake, Jr. is kicking my butt

11:38.585 --> 11:40.209
worse than those seventh-grade girls do.

11:40.234 --> 11:43.302
Listen, all you have to
do is believe in yourself.

11:43.742 --> 11:47.123
Imagine you're the only kid up there,

11:47.148 --> 11:48.920
and you're not sharing the spotlight

11:48.945 --> 11:51.045
or your room with anybody.

11:51.070 --> 11:54.881
Make today the best day
of your entire life!

11:54.906 --> 11:56.318
He's gone.

11:56.618 --> 11:58.146
You gotta stop encouraging him.

11:58.171 --> 11:59.420
The world just isn't fair.

11:59.445 --> 12:01.263
Oh, no. I don't accept that.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.623
There's gotta be a way
we can help Cash win.

12:03.648 --> 12:05.998
Well, I think what
you're talking about...

12:06.600 --> 12:08.193
is cheating.

12:08.218 --> 12:09.248
Eh?

12:09.273 --> 12:11.631
You may have put my
credit score in the 400s,

12:11.656 --> 12:14.156
but it's nice to have you
around for the shady stuff.

12:14.181 --> 12:16.193
I may no longer be your husband,

12:16.218 --> 12:18.084
but I'll always be your scumbag.

12:19.762 --> 12:20.972
Okay, I'm gonna see if

12:20.997 --> 12:23.377
I can convince Torsten
to give Cash a higher score.

12:23.402 --> 12:24.701
I'll work on Arthur.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.102
Call us the grounds crew

12:26.104 --> 12:28.271
'cause we're about to
level the playing field.

12:28.273 --> 12:29.355
Whoo.

12:40.056 --> 12:43.006
Ooh, my hammies are burning.

12:43.031 --> 12:44.921
Glad it's not my pee, though.
Am I right?

12:44.923 --> 12:47.591
Can we not make small talk
when we're both exposed

12:47.593 --> 12:50.014
in a room built for children?

12:50.039 --> 12:53.422
Oh, you're playing it like that, huh?

12:53.828 --> 12:55.565
I think it would be a real shame

12:55.567 --> 12:57.641
if something were to happen
to that boat of yours.

12:57.666 --> 13:00.016
Say someone broke the engine?

13:00.041 --> 13:01.381
The engine's already broken.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.242
A squirrel lives in there.

13:04.551 --> 13:07.788
Shame if something were
to happen to that squirrel, though.

13:07.813 --> 13:10.134
Are you threatening me, Wayne?

13:10.159 --> 13:12.156
I'm trying to, but it's hard
when you don't have anything

13:12.180 --> 13:14.334
that's valuable or that you love.

13:14.359 --> 13:15.359
Oh, come on, man.

13:15.384 --> 13:17.991
Ginny's gonna be pissed as hell
if I don't get you to help us.

13:18.016 --> 13:19.022
Ginny's involved?

13:19.024 --> 13:20.957
Did she instruct you
to do a terrible job?

13:20.959 --> 13:23.320
Was peeing the entire
time part of the plan?

13:23.345 --> 13:24.345
Oh.

13:25.530 --> 13:26.959
Hope there's no hard feelings.

13:26.984 --> 13:28.350
You've gotta be kidding.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.441
You're right.

13:32.017 --> 13:34.539
I asked you here because
I accidentally overheard

13:34.564 --> 13:35.797
your conversation with Karl.

13:35.822 --> 13:37.692
That was a lie. I was eavesdropping.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.109
Today's my moral cheat day.

13:39.134 --> 13:41.359
Well, then today's my
social niceties cheat day.

13:41.384 --> 13:42.764
So get to the damn point.

13:42.789 --> 13:43.922
I've often bitten my tongue

13:43.947 --> 13:46.014
watching you besmirch
your own reputation,

13:46.039 --> 13:47.892
but I'd hate to see
it getting in the way

13:47.894 --> 13:49.494
of a promising relationship.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.697
The way I choose to grieve
the loss of my husband

13:52.699 --> 13:54.836
is nobody's business.

13:55.646 --> 13:57.078
Or is that just something you say

13:57.103 --> 13:59.664
when you don't wanna let
anybody get too close?

14:00.740 --> 14:02.773
I'm sorry. Perhaps I've overstepped.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.203
No.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.937
You're not wrong about that.

14:06.962 --> 14:09.281
Just sometimes I think...

14:09.937 --> 14:12.045
You know it's wintertime outside, right?

14:12.508 --> 14:13.522
Sorry.

14:13.547 --> 14:15.330
High beams. Continue.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.189
It's always been hard
for me to let people in.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.594
So having people think I'm a murderer

14:20.619 --> 14:22.883
is a very effective way
of keeping them out.

14:22.908 --> 14:24.973
If you're running into
this problem with Karl,

14:24.998 --> 14:27.242
you're gonna run into it again
with the next Karl

14:27.267 --> 14:29.164
and the next Karl.

14:29.189 --> 14:31.518
To be clear, I'm not talking
about three men named Karl.

14:31.543 --> 14:33.750
- It's symbolic for...
- Got it, man.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.508
And now I think his name is weird.

14:39.195 --> 14:40.758
So on your podcast,

14:40.783 --> 14:43.797
you interview other winners
of the Conley Fork's Finest?

14:43.822 --> 14:45.889
That is fascinating.

14:45.914 --> 14:47.914
What's it called and how do I subscribe?

14:47.939 --> 14:50.039
It's called "Tour de Torsten,"

14:50.064 --> 14:51.601
and I don't know.

14:51.626 --> 14:53.159
Don't fall for it.

14:53.184 --> 14:55.403
She's just trying to get
her kid a higher score.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.772
I knew it was weird that
somebody was talking to me.

14:59.228 --> 15:01.226
Mother warned me about women.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.466
What the hell's going on with you?

15:04.491 --> 15:05.922
I just...

15:05.947 --> 15:07.916
I really, really want Cash to win

15:07.941 --> 15:10.500
so he believes that the
world is a fair place.

15:10.525 --> 15:12.391
So you wanna show your son

15:12.416 --> 15:15.139
that the world is fair by cheating?

15:15.164 --> 15:17.081
It's like this trampoline.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.150
The more advantages
somebody is born with,

15:19.152 --> 15:20.752
the more springs they have.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.087
So they bounce really, really high,

15:23.089 --> 15:25.898
and everybody thinks
that they're God's gift.

15:26.097 --> 15:28.969
But if you don't have money
for piano lessons, well...

15:30.102 --> 15:32.812
You take away a spring.

15:32.837 --> 15:34.633
You're born in the wrong place?

15:34.658 --> 15:36.578
Take away another spring.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.430
You have to share your toys
with your younger sibling

15:39.455 --> 15:42.476
because your mom got horny for
her snake-tatted ex-husband.

15:42.501 --> 15:44.625
Well, how many do we take off for that?

15:44.650 --> 15:46.216
Hang on. Hang on.

15:46.241 --> 15:48.914
Wait, are you pregnant?

15:49.667 --> 15:52.078
Wayne and I,
we did a little backsliding,

15:52.103 --> 15:54.851
and I might be a little pregnant.

15:56.098 --> 15:58.508
But I'm just not ready to take the test.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.095
You know you don't have to study for it.

16:00.119 --> 16:04.500
Arthur, my life is just
spiraling out of control.

16:04.525 --> 16:07.492
And I just... I wanted to give Cash

16:07.517 --> 16:11.813
one really great moment before
his whole world changes.

16:12.164 --> 16:13.304
Tell you what...

16:15.812 --> 16:20.157
I will do whatever I can

16:20.182 --> 16:22.687
to make sure Cash wins.

16:23.456 --> 16:26.273
What happened to being
fair and impartial?

16:26.298 --> 16:28.539
It just occurred to me
that I am judging a contest

16:28.564 --> 16:30.998
to see which kid gets
to meet the space alien,

16:31.023 --> 16:35.870
and so, I thought maybe I could
come down off my high horse...

16:36.211 --> 16:37.829
for Cash.

16:39.751 --> 16:41.250
Well, thank you.

16:41.275 --> 16:44.546
Ladies and gentlemen,
for his athletic portion,

16:44.571 --> 16:48.723
Blake Lake, Jr. has brought
a special certain UK mascot

16:48.748 --> 16:49.793
to help him out.

16:49.818 --> 16:51.684
- No way.
- It's Scratch!

17:02.196 --> 17:03.196
Oh...

17:03.795 --> 17:04.795
Ugh.

17:04.819 --> 17:07.119
Hey. Psst! Hey.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.327
I... I know I just
tried to bribe someone,

17:09.329 --> 17:11.829
but he's actually trying
to buy the contest.

17:11.830 --> 17:13.431
I mean, that's not the real Scratch,

17:13.433 --> 17:15.027
but still, fake Scratch ain't free.

17:15.051 --> 17:16.637
Yeah, what does...
What does that have to do

17:16.662 --> 17:18.619
- with athletic ability?
- Ugh.

17:18.645 --> 17:21.373
Blake Lake, Jr.
will now jump over Scratch

17:21.397 --> 17:23.271
and dunk a basketball.

17:23.296 --> 17:25.451
I actually kind of wanna see that.

17:25.476 --> 17:28.256
- What? Ugh.
- Can this kid actually dunk?

17:28.281 --> 17:30.181
Well, he's using a mini trampoline,

17:30.183 --> 17:32.250
as did eight previous pageant winners.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.764
Not I. I did a baton routine.

17:36.075 --> 17:38.037
You think it's the same mini trampoline?

17:38.062 --> 17:39.459
I mean, it's a public school.

17:39.484 --> 17:41.592
How many mini trampolines
do you think they have?

17:41.617 --> 17:42.873
We should really say something.

17:42.898 --> 17:44.124
We should definitely say something.

17:44.148 --> 17:45.476
- Absolutely. No doubt.
- Two...

17:45.500 --> 17:47.051
- Right?
- One!

17:53.039 --> 17:54.939
- Oof.
- Scratch!

17:58.452 --> 18:00.068
Oh, my God, Arthur.

18:00.093 --> 18:02.428
Arthur, we sabotaged a child.

18:02.453 --> 18:05.178
"We"? I don't recall
touching any springs.

18:05.203 --> 18:07.623
Mom, what are you talking about?

18:07.648 --> 18:09.071
You didn't do that, did you?

18:09.073 --> 18:10.287
Of course I didn't do it...

18:10.312 --> 18:11.874
On purpose... I don't think.

18:11.876 --> 18:14.893
Shame about Blake Lake, Jr.,
but with him out of the way,

18:14.918 --> 18:16.245
you're the odds-on favorite.

18:16.247 --> 18:19.145
How about another round
of applause for our kids?

18:19.790 --> 18:23.033
One of our contestants
would like to say something.

18:23.058 --> 18:24.278
Cash?

18:26.668 --> 18:29.636
Blake Lake, Jr. was going to win,

18:29.661 --> 18:32.395
and it's not his fault he got hurt.

18:32.873 --> 18:34.932
- So I think...
- I'll compete in his place.

18:34.957 --> 18:37.231
It's my duty as a former finest boy.

18:38.777 --> 18:42.245
Uh, I just thought that
we should say he wins?

18:42.270 --> 18:43.886
- Yeah!
- Okay, well...

18:43.911 --> 18:45.277
what do the judges say?

18:45.302 --> 18:47.286
Uh, yes. Yes, with no hesitation

18:47.311 --> 18:49.879
and absolutely nothing
weighing on my conscience. Yes.

18:49.904 --> 18:51.161
We have a winner.

18:51.186 --> 18:53.552
Blake Lake, Jr.!

19:03.561 --> 19:06.028
♪ There he is ♪

19:06.053 --> 19:08.996
♪ Our finest son ♪

19:09.021 --> 19:11.129

19:11.154 --> 19:16.991

myself when I had the chance.

19:24.075 --> 19:26.176
He turned out pretty good, didn't he?

19:26.201 --> 19:27.942
Yeah. He's going places.

19:27.967 --> 19:31.068
Maybe having another child
wouldn't be the worst idea.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.395
Time to pee on a stick.

19:33.420 --> 19:34.575
Hey...

19:35.205 --> 19:37.809
maybe aim for the seat
and you'll hit the stick.

19:39.513 --> 19:40.513
What?

19:47.935 --> 19:49.401
Glad you called me.

19:49.426 --> 19:51.332
Unless you're gonna murder me too.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.169
- Do I get to make those jokes?
- It's fun, isn't it?

19:53.193 --> 19:54.325
Yeah.

19:54.350 --> 19:57.364
Listen, I like you, and you're right.

19:57.389 --> 20:00.567
We should be able to
talk about anything...

20:00.592 --> 20:02.364
That happens outside of the bathroom.

20:02.389 --> 20:04.895
- Oh yeah, we're not there yet.
- We'll never be there.

20:05.481 --> 20:07.926
And I do wanna tell you about Keith.

20:08.092 --> 20:10.332
I just need a little more time.

20:10.357 --> 20:12.858
Take all the time you need.
I'm here for you.

20:15.119 --> 20:17.442
- I'll call you later, yeah?
- Yeah.

20:17.467 --> 20:18.733
Okay.

20:27.311 --> 20:29.871
Keith, we need to talk.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.661
Well...

20:35.211 --> 20:36.477
I was wrong.

20:36.502 --> 20:38.942
- I'm not pregnant.
- Oh.

20:38.967 --> 20:41.645
Well, I'm not gonna lie.

20:42.039 --> 20:43.598
Part of me is disappointed.

20:43.623 --> 20:45.123
Aw.

20:45.148 --> 20:47.684
- Oh, hey, sweetie.
- Hey, son.

20:47.709 --> 20:48.911
I am so proud of you.

20:48.936 --> 20:51.457
You chose fairness over an easy win,

20:51.482 --> 20:54.418
and in my eyes,
you will always be Conley Fork's finest.

20:54.443 --> 20:56.973
- Yeah, and he's smart too.
- Mm-hmm.

20:56.998 --> 20:59.780
Blake Lake, Jr.
paid out eight-to-one odds.

20:59.805 --> 21:02.147
Spend it all in one place.
Screw the haters.

21:02.172 --> 21:04.272
You bet against your own son?

21:04.297 --> 21:05.342
No, it was his idea.

21:05.367 --> 21:06.733
When Blake Lake, Jr. got hurt,

21:06.758 --> 21:08.819
he had the brilliant
idea to bet against him.

21:08.844 --> 21:10.514
- What?
- That's when I threw the contest.

21:10.539 --> 21:12.842
Do the right thing and make some bank.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.319
That is your son.

21:15.344 --> 21:16.850
Darn right he is.

21:18.084 --> 21:19.515
I need a shot.
