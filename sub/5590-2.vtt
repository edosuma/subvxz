beside the mississippi flood ¶

25:28.420 --> 25:30.553
Excuse me. Hey, will.
Hey, there you are.

25:30.555 --> 25:31.787
Hey.
I thought we missed you.

25:31.789 --> 25:32.921
No.
How you doing?

25:32.923 --> 25:34.489
Hey, you know these two,
right?

25:34.491 --> 25:36.324
Oh, of course.
How you doing, mr. Cole?

25:36.326 --> 25:37.792
Come on, now.

25:37.794 --> 25:39.660
The only person who calls me
mr. Cole is, uh...

25:39.662 --> 25:41.461
Well, come to think of it,
no one does.

25:41.463 --> 25:43.496
Well, I don't know
how else to address a legend.

25:43.498 --> 25:45.197
And I believe you already know
this legend, as well.

25:45.199 --> 25:46.264
Oh, thank you.

25:46.266 --> 25:47.265
It's good to see you again,
pam.

25:47.267 --> 25:48.266
Good to see you, too,
will.

25:48.268 --> 25:49.667
It's been a while.
It has.

25:49.669 --> 25:52.302
It's a brave thing you did,
opening up like that, son.

25:52.304 --> 25:53.836
I appreciate that.

25:53.838 --> 25:55.370
All right, listen,
I got to go play host,

25:55.372 --> 25:56.604
But why don't y'all
grab a drink, okay?

25:56.606 --> 25:57.738
Thanks.
All right.

25:57.740 --> 25:59.940
Excuse me, um...

25:59.942 --> 26:03.910
Could I get a round of bourbon
for myself and my friends?

26:03.912 --> 26:06.812
Pam: So, will,
what do you think of the album?

26:06.814 --> 26:08.580
I was raised on
the bobs and johns...
Mm-hmm.

26:08.582 --> 26:10.281
...You know, dylan, marley,
lennon, cash.

26:10.283 --> 26:11.466
I can hear that.

26:11.467 --> 26:12.650
Nah, you can't hear it
on my albums.

26:12.652 --> 26:13.817
I can.
Really?

26:13.819 --> 26:15.218
Clear off
some of the other stuff,

26:15.220 --> 26:16.419
You can hear it
breaking through.

26:16.421 --> 26:18.521
What, over the keyboards
and the guitars

26:18.523 --> 26:20.789
And the overproduction?
Well...

26:20.791 --> 26:22.957
Everything about that
was a battle, you know?

26:22.959 --> 26:25.392
It was like,
from the songwriting

26:25.394 --> 26:28.194
To the...Vision
to the execution...
Yeah.

26:28.196 --> 26:29.795
...It was like, by the time
I got done with all that,

26:29.797 --> 26:32.297
I just hated the music
we were making, you know?

26:32.299 --> 26:35.433
Yeah. And band dynamics
are brutal.
Oh, yeah.

26:35.435 --> 26:36.734
That's why I'm going solo.
Yeah.

26:36.736 --> 26:39.870
Except, every label head
I meet with,

26:39.872 --> 26:41.905
They just --
they want more of the same.

26:41.907 --> 26:44.674
Oh. Believe me,
I know that.

26:44.676 --> 26:45.741
That's why
I started my own label.

26:45.743 --> 26:47.125
Yeah.

26:47.126 --> 26:48.508
What do<i> you</i> want?
What do you want to do next?

You're the first person
to ask me that.

Too bad I have -- I have no clue
what my next move ought to be.

27:03.555 --> 27:05.922
I think
it should be country.

27:05.924 --> 27:07.723
The album we're here
to celebrate tonight,

27:07.725 --> 27:10.358
The one that dropped
just this morning,

27:10.360 --> 27:14.361
Is now the #1 album on both
the pop and the country charts.

And it sounds like she's
got some reservations
about our -- our tour,

38:06.965 --> 38:09.231

it's probably 'cause of

Look, if scarlett
changed her mind about the tour,

It was because she realized
her priorities are<i> here</i>
