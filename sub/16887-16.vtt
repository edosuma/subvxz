WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:03.034
<i>Hi, I'm Chuck.</i>
<i>Here's a few things</i>

00:03.101 --> 00:04.502
<i>that you might need to know.</i>
<i>I'm not a FULCRUM agent.</i>

00:04.569 --> 00:05.903
I'm MI6 working undercover.

00:05.971 --> 00:08.539
I want to apologize
to you directly, Agent Barker.

00:08.607 --> 00:10.341
We had no record you were MI6.

00:10.409 --> 00:12.643
Locked up in this dungeon's
like keeping a Botticelli

00:12.711 --> 00:13.945
<i>in the basement.</i>

00:14.012 --> 00:16.113
<i>No one can appreciate</i>
<i>the beauty.</i>

00:16.181 --> 00:17.448
I'm moving out.
- Yes!

00:17.516 --> 00:18.816
And moving in with Morgan.
- No!

00:18.884 --> 00:19.884
I'm the Intersect.

00:19.952 --> 00:22.007
No, he's not.
It's me.

00:22.154 --> 00:25.189
If you know who Chuck really is,
then you pose a security threat.

00:25.257 --> 00:27.358
If I proved anything
to you by now,

00:27.426 --> 00:29.827
<i>it's that I can keep my word.</i>
<i>- Cole's been captured.</i>

00:29.895 --> 00:31.963
You need to go into
24-hour protective detail.

00:32.030 --> 00:33.965
What exactly does that mean?
- We have to move in together.

00:34.032 --> 00:35.633
He's a really tough guy.
Maybe he won't talk.

00:35.701 --> 00:37.768
Chuck, everyone talks.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:46.011 --> 00:48.012
What's your real name?

00:48.080 --> 00:50.748
Bond, James Bond.

00:52.050 --> 00:55.453
How much does the CIA
know about Perseus?

01:00.692 --> 01:02.193
Oh, come on, not the face.

01:02.260 --> 01:04.295
Ahh!

01:04.363 --> 01:06.397
I'm only going to ask you
one more question.

01:06.465 --> 01:08.299
You answer it,
and we're done.

01:10.335 --> 01:13.771
Who is the Intersect?

01:19.311 --> 01:21.178
# #

01:35.360 --> 01:37.695
Morning, Chuck.

01:37.763 --> 01:39.263
How'd you sleep?

01:40.932 --> 01:43.067
Fine, thank you.

01:45.804 --> 01:48.873
Well, busy day.
Lots to do.

01:48.940 --> 01:52.743
Uh, so, shower.
Do you want to go first or...?

01:52.811 --> 01:54.078
I'm good.

01:54.146 --> 01:58.349
You know, I know
this whole 24-hour

01:58.417 --> 02:01.419
supervision thing
isn't exactly great,

02:01.486 --> 02:03.154
but when the CIA finds us
a new apartment,

02:03.221 --> 02:04.255
at least we'll have
separate rooms.

02:04.322 --> 02:05.656
Sounds great.

02:05.724 --> 02:07.158
I mean, consider yourself lucky.

02:07.225 --> 02:09.592
At least you didn't have
to move in with Casey, right?

02:09.661 --> 02:11.295
Yeah.

02:12.931 --> 02:15.066
Lucky me.

02:21.740 --> 02:23.107
Mm,

02:23.175 --> 02:25.209
spearmint okay?
- Yeah, fine.

02:25.277 --> 02:26.644
Traditionally, I'm
a peppermint man,

02:26.711 --> 02:27.878
but I'm living
on the edge.

02:34.052 --> 02:36.353
Sarah, can I ask
you a question?

02:36.421 --> 02:38.022
About the toothpaste?

02:38.090 --> 02:44.361
Uh, no. Are you, you
worried about Cole?

02:44.429 --> 02:49.333
Uh... of, of course
I'm concerned about Cole.

02:49.401 --> 02:53.871
But Agent Barker can
certainly take care of himself.

02:53.939 --> 02:56.373
Yeah, I get that.

02:56.441 --> 02:59.743
It's just, you know,
you guys had this connection.

02:59.811 --> 03:03.314
I mean, he saved your life and
you shared a bit of torture.

03:03.381 --> 03:05.883
Uh, our connection
was purely professional.

03:05.951 --> 03:07.451
That's it.

03:07.519 --> 03:09.820
Oh, okay.

03:09.888 --> 03:11.655
Thanks, honey.
- Mm-hmm.

03:13.024 --> 03:14.892
Hi! Good morning!

03:14.960 --> 03:16.660
Whoa!
- Oh!

03:16.728 --> 03:18.295
Oh! Sorry, sorry.

03:18.363 --> 03:21.265
I'm just, I'm very excited
for Chuck, for the both of you

03:21.333 --> 03:22.933
to be moving
in together.

03:23.001 --> 03:24.301
It's still happening, yeah?

03:24.369 --> 03:25.436
Oh, yeah.
- Absolutely.

03:25.504 --> 03:27.371
Great. Did you find
a place yet?

03:27.439 --> 03:29.974
Not that I'm trying
to rush you or anything.

03:30.041 --> 03:31.709
Take your time, bro.
No pressure.

03:31.776 --> 03:33.344
You two lovebirds
need to find a nest

03:33.411 --> 03:34.945
where you can let
the worm wiggle free.

03:35.013 --> 03:37.014
Thank you, Devon.

03:37.082 --> 03:39.517
Do you need any help packing
or throwing things away?

03:39.584 --> 03:42.253
Sarah, please tell Chuck
that not everything in that room

03:42.320 --> 03:43.921
has to survive the move.

03:43.989 --> 03:45.289
I'm making a list.

03:45.357 --> 03:48.559
Making, uh, making
a list, are you?

03:48.627 --> 03:50.127
And of what, may I ask?

03:50.195 --> 03:52.129
Oh, well, where should we begin?

03:52.197 --> 03:54.765
Maybe the <i>Tron</i> poster that
you've had since you were 12.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.701
Dad gave me that poster,.

04:01.072 --> 04:02.973
I know. He loved that movie.

04:04.843 --> 04:07.678
Have you had any luck finding
his address for the wedding?

04:07.746 --> 04:09.680
No, not yet,

04:09.748 --> 04:11.549
but you know,

04:11.616 --> 04:12.816
I'm, I'm working on it still.

04:15.020 --> 04:16.720
So, uh, how did
Morgan take the news

04:16.788 --> 04:18.622
that he wasn't gonna get
you as a new roommate?

04:18.690 --> 04:21.358
I didn't tell him yet.

04:21.426 --> 04:22.860
I don't have the heart.

04:24.963 --> 04:27.831
Morgan Grimes is so tired
of listening to Big Mike punch

04:27.899 --> 04:30.267
his mama's time clock
that he actually showed up

04:30.335 --> 04:31.902
for work on time today.

04:31.970 --> 04:33.170
Oh...!

04:33.238 --> 04:35.406
Okay, okay, well, Morgan Grimes
is so disturbed

04:35.473 --> 04:37.808
by what Big Mike is doing
to his mama

04:37.876 --> 04:40.411
that the thought of Jeff
doing the same thing to Anna

04:40.478 --> 04:41.812
is actually sweet, sweet
relief.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.214
Oh...!

04:43.281 --> 04:45.749
Oh, snap.

04:47.719 --> 04:48.852
That's good.
Laugh it up, fuzzballs.

04:48.920 --> 04:50.054
That's right, sure.

04:50.121 --> 04:51.989
But guess what.
I just landed the whale,

04:52.057 --> 04:53.857
'cause me and my man Chuck,
we're gonna be roommates.

04:53.925 --> 04:55.693
So, yeah, yeah, have your fun.
Have at it.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.228
But don't expect

04:57.295 --> 04:58.696
any housewarming invitations from me.

04:58.763 --> 05:00.197
Don't give me
that face.

05:00.265 --> 05:01.932
Hey, Morgan, buddy, hey,
we got to talk.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.834
Yeah, you're just the
man I wanted to see.

05:03.902 --> 05:04.969
Listen, I found
a place.

05:05.036 --> 05:06.237
Dude, are you ready?
Two bedroom,

05:06.304 --> 05:07.504
one-and-a-quarter bath,
half a fireplace.

05:07.572 --> 05:08.772
About the apartment.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.708
Yeah, dude, I know.
You and I, roommates.

05:10.775 --> 05:12.243
This is great.
We're living the dream, Chuck.

05:12.310 --> 05:13.811
It's what we always
talked about.

05:13.878 --> 05:15.379
The thing is, the thing is,
th-there is...

05:15.447 --> 05:17.748
Bartkowski,
my office now!

05:17.816 --> 05:19.650
When did you get
an office, John?

05:21.853 --> 05:23.287
Hey, what's going on?
We moving?

05:23.355 --> 05:25.489
No-tell motel time for Chuck.

05:25.557 --> 05:27.491
A secure bunker
in an undisclosed location.

05:27.559 --> 05:28.959
Seriously, what's
with the boxes?

05:29.027 --> 05:31.862
Cole Barker was picked up
12 hours ago by FULCRUM.

05:31.930 --> 05:35.032
We spent the entire night
looking for him and failed.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.233
Langley thinks when he talks.

05:36.301 --> 05:37.601
They're gonna come here
looking for you.

05:37.669 --> 05:39.003
We're taking you off the grid.

05:39.070 --> 05:40.838
Wait, what about my sister?
Is she in danger?

05:40.905 --> 05:41.905
Awesome, Morgan?

05:41.973 --> 05:43.374
First priority
is to get you safe.

05:43.441 --> 05:44.975
Then I'm gonna come
back and make sure

05:45.043 --> 05:46.410
everybody else
is okay.

05:47.579 --> 05:50.047
If we get that far.

05:50.115 --> 05:53.917
This 240-27.
We have a perimeter breach.

05:53.985 --> 05:56.754
This is it. I'm gonna die
underneath a yogurt shop.

05:56.821 --> 05:57.788
Back door now.

05:57.856 --> 05:59.690
Move, move, move.

05:59.758 --> 06:00.791
Sarah, Sarah,
we need to talk.

06:00.859 --> 06:01.992
If I knew this was
gonna happen...

06:02.060 --> 06:03.594
Later.

06:06.398 --> 06:07.464
Chuck, get back!

06:15.140 --> 06:16.073
Cole?

06:16.141 --> 06:17.574
panting)

06:17.642 --> 06:20.611
Take this.

06:20.679 --> 06:23.881
Did you miss me?

06:23.948 --> 06:28.185
Don't worry.
I didn't say a word.

06:28.253 --> 06:30.287
Look at that.

06:30.355 --> 06:32.222
Maybe you're not going
away after all.

06:34.259 --> 06:36.160
Lucky you.

06:36.227 --> 06:37.328
Yeah.

06:39.097 --> 06:41.165
Lucky me.

06:58.616 --> 07:01.118
# Na-na na-na na-na #

07:01.186 --> 07:03.053
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

07:03.121 --> 07:04.788
# Na-na na-na na-na #

07:04.856 --> 07:06.957
# Na-na na-na
na-na #

07:07.025 --> 07:09.193
# Na-na na-na na-na #

07:09.260 --> 07:11.462
# Na-na na-na na-na. #

07:11.529 --> 07:12.830
Hey!

07:18.531 --> 07:20.199
After that,
it was eight,

07:20.266 --> 07:23.435
maybe nine guys
until the door.

07:23.503 --> 07:25.971
Oh, come one.

07:26.039 --> 07:27.206
We're supposed
to believe

07:27.273 --> 07:28.874
that he took out
nine guys and escaped

07:28.942 --> 07:31.243
a FULCRUM holding facility
all by himself.

07:31.311 --> 07:33.111
Please, I don't think
we can trust this guy.

07:33.179 --> 07:34.413
I've done nine before.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.581
You've taken out
nine guys?

07:35.648 --> 07:38.283
Just saying
it's doable.

07:38.351 --> 07:39.685
So when they questioned you
about the Intersect...

07:39.752 --> 07:41.386
I didn't tell them anything.

07:41.454 --> 07:43.388
It's not my first
dance, Walker.

07:43.456 --> 07:48.427
If I talked, then Chuck,
Casey, you...

07:50.697 --> 07:52.698
...are all in
the crosshairs.

07:52.765 --> 07:55.500
Not an option.

07:55.568 --> 07:57.669
Why come back here
after you escaped?

08:01.407 --> 08:03.342
I wanted to make sure
you were safe.

08:06.045 --> 08:08.013
<i>You are the sexiest man</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

08:08.081 --> 08:09.514
For you.

08:09.582 --> 08:11.216
It's our 16-month anniversary.

08:11.284 --> 08:13.418
Wait a minute.
We had a "no gift" policy.

08:13.486 --> 08:14.753
I didn't get you anything.

08:14.821 --> 08:18.023
Morgan, you're the worst
person at keeping secrets.

08:18.091 --> 08:19.825
I already know what you got me.

08:20.960 --> 08:21.927
You left the lease

08:21.995 --> 08:22.828
for our new apartment

08:22.895 --> 08:24.896
in the fax machine.

08:24.964 --> 08:27.799
A life together
is the best present ever!

08:27.867 --> 08:29.401
And when we move in,

08:29.469 --> 08:31.169
I'm gonna show you your mother

08:31.237 --> 08:34.539
isn't the only one
who can be noisy in the bedroom.

08:34.607 --> 08:36.508
I gotta go call my parents.

08:41.481 --> 08:43.582
I thought you were
moving in with Chuck?

08:43.650 --> 08:45.917
I am. We are.
Anna misunderstood.

08:45.985 --> 08:47.219
She found the lease.
Now she thinks...

08:47.287 --> 08:48.253
Oh, my God.

08:48.321 --> 08:49.988
Oh, buddy,
you are screwed.

08:50.056 --> 08:52.291
No, actually, I think if I tell
the truth at this point,

08:52.358 --> 08:54.393
it'll end the sexual component
of our relationship.

08:54.460 --> 08:56.361
Mm.
- And I'll be there to pick up the pieces.

08:56.429 --> 08:57.462
What?

08:57.530 --> 08:59.531
Shh-shh-shh,
relax, Morgan.

08:59.599 --> 09:00.999
All you have to do
is convince Anna

09:01.067 --> 09:03.769
that moving in
with you is a bad idea.

09:03.836 --> 09:04.803
Okay, but how am I gonna...?

09:04.871 --> 09:06.438
Sh-sh-shh, <i>bubeleh,</i>

09:06.506 --> 09:08.573
you've come to
the right place.

09:08.641 --> 09:11.743
Repulsion is
our business.

09:11.811 --> 09:14.680
And business is good.

09:16.783 --> 09:19.151
Thanks to information provided
by Mr. Barker,

09:19.218 --> 09:21.119
we now know that FULCRUM
is protecting a man

09:21.187 --> 09:22.788
that goes by the code name
"Perseus."

09:22.855 --> 09:25.023
Perseus is the
head scientist

09:25.091 --> 09:26.825
behind FULCRUM's effort
to build their own Intersect.

09:28.394 --> 09:30.362
Anything, Chuck?

09:30.430 --> 09:32.764
I spent the past year
undercover trying to get close to him,

09:32.832 --> 09:35.267
but only the inner circle is
ever allowed contact with the man.

09:35.335 --> 09:38.537
Intel tells us Perseus
is attending a formal event

09:38.604 --> 09:40.138
tonight
at the Swiss Consul's office.

09:40.206 --> 09:41.573
The State Department has
arranged invitations

09:41.641 --> 09:42.841
for the two of you.

09:42.909 --> 09:45.210
Um, the two,
the two of who?

09:45.278 --> 09:46.712
Agent Walker and Agent Casey.

09:49.015 --> 09:50.482
Are you sure, General?

09:50.550 --> 09:52.017
I'd be happy to accompany
Agent Walker.

09:52.085 --> 09:52.951
I bet you would.

09:53.019 --> 09:54.953
I'd be happy
to go, too.

09:55.021 --> 09:56.388
Oh, aren't
you popular?

09:56.456 --> 09:58.657
I mean, you know, I am, I am
the Intersect and everything.

09:58.725 --> 10:00.192
Neither Agent Barker nor
Bartkowski will be going

10:00.259 --> 10:01.727
on this mission.

10:01.794 --> 10:04.396
FULCRUM is still actively
searching for the two of you.

10:04.464 --> 10:07.532
Both of you will stay in CASTLE
and monitor by remote feed.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.634
If you recognize anyone,
you'll have radio.

10:09.702 --> 10:12.304
Well, at least
no one's telling us to...

10:12.372 --> 10:14.506
You heard the General.
You stay in the bunker.

10:14.574 --> 10:16.241
And there it is.

10:16.309 --> 10:18.210
<i>Phase one</i>
<i>of operation repulsion:</i>

10:18.277 --> 10:19.945
<i>the obscure</i>
<i>and disturbing hobby.</i>

10:28.020 --> 10:29.321
Take that, you chauvinist pig.

10:29.389 --> 10:30.989
Told you not mess
with Billie Jean.

10:31.057 --> 10:32.391
You bitch.

10:32.458 --> 10:33.558
Hey, Morgan, I'm
done for the day.

10:33.626 --> 10:34.760
You want to
take me over,

10:34.827 --> 10:36.428
show me the new apartment?

10:36.496 --> 10:38.397
Uh, you know what,
I'd love to, hon,

10:38.464 --> 10:39.631
but we're in the
middle of recreating

10:39.699 --> 10:40.866
some of the best
tennis matches ever played,

10:40.933 --> 10:41.633
and I'm up next.

10:41.701 --> 10:44.369
McEnroe, Stockholm, '84.

10:44.437 --> 10:45.837
You can't be serious.

10:45.905 --> 10:47.072
Yes!

10:47.140 --> 10:48.006
Look on
the bright side.

10:48.074 --> 10:49.141
When we move in together,

10:49.208 --> 10:50.509
you can play, too.

10:50.576 --> 10:51.710
It will be like a nonstop

10:51.778 --> 10:53.078
Wimbledon final
in our living room.

10:54.914 --> 10:56.181
Doubles anyone?

10:56.249 --> 10:57.449
Ugh.

11:02.889 --> 11:05.190
That's, that's, that's
95% alcohol.

11:05.258 --> 11:06.725
Don't touch me with that.

11:20.239 --> 11:21.373
Video check.

11:21.441 --> 11:22.874
Do we have a signal?

11:22.942 --> 11:23.708
Yep, we got you.

11:23.776 --> 11:25.477
And you look fantastic.

11:25.545 --> 11:27.245
Sarah, is that dress
CIA issue,

11:27.313 --> 11:29.347
or do you just make
everything look that good?

11:29.415 --> 11:30.816
Let's stay focused here, people, huh?

11:30.883 --> 11:32.317
We are on a mission.

11:32.385 --> 11:35.086
You do look gorgeous, Sarah.

11:35.154 --> 11:37.289
This is Chuck speaking
by the way.

11:37.356 --> 11:38.957
Okay, too many cooks
in the kitchen.

11:39.025 --> 11:41.126
Chuck, you get in Casey's ear,
I'll get in Sarah's.

11:41.194 --> 11:43.595
Okay, you two,
split up.

11:47.834 --> 11:49.968
Sarah, you've got
an unsecured exit at 2:00.

11:50.036 --> 11:52.871
The guy in the bad suit
standing in front

11:52.939 --> 11:54.773
of the Swiss flag is packing.

11:56.843 --> 11:58.243
Casey, you got a bogey.

11:59.979 --> 12:01.279
A tray of crab cakes

12:01.347 --> 12:02.314
coming in on your 10:00.

12:05.751 --> 12:07.819
I'm just trying to
be helpful, okay?

12:07.887 --> 12:09.554
Works up an appetite
on missions.

12:09.622 --> 12:11.056
Grab that little...

12:17.463 --> 12:18.530
Sarah, the Italian minister
for trade

12:18.598 --> 12:19.898
is headed your way.

12:19.966 --> 12:21.366
Now he can get
a little handsy.

12:21.434 --> 12:22.434
Hello.

12:22.502 --> 12:23.835
I'm Paolo Giordano.

12:23.903 --> 12:25.070
I saw you arrive

12:25.137 --> 12:26.872
and couldn't help
but admire your beauty.

12:26.939 --> 12:28.139
His wife's name is Isabella

12:28.207 --> 12:30.008
and he has three
little bambinos.

12:30.076 --> 12:31.243
Thank you.

12:31.310 --> 12:32.477
How are Isabella
and the children?

12:34.113 --> 12:35.146
<i>Senorina.</i>

12:38.818 --> 12:40.318
Nicely done.

12:40.386 --> 12:41.820
Not so bad yourself.

12:41.888 --> 12:43.054
Thanks. Thank you.

12:43.122 --> 12:45.190
Just, uh, just doing our job.

12:45.258 --> 12:46.691
Me and Cole,
Cole and me.

12:46.759 --> 12:47.859
Take your victory lap

12:47.927 --> 12:48.994
later, Bartowski.

12:49.061 --> 12:50.328
Who else haven't we seen?

12:50.396 --> 12:52.964
I don't know, look
at the people by that

12:53.032 --> 12:54.266
ice goose thing.

13:02.975 --> 13:05.043
Oh, okay, I just flashed.

13:05.111 --> 13:05.844
The shorter balding
gentleman

13:05.912 --> 13:07.279
in the sweater

13:07.346 --> 13:09.147
wearing the glasses--
that has got to be Perseus.

13:09.215 --> 13:11.283
I have a visual. Moving in.

13:11.350 --> 13:12.817
His name is
Howard Busgang.

13:12.885 --> 13:14.052
He's a research scientist

13:14.120 --> 13:15.620
with the Department of Defense.

13:15.688 --> 13:16.721
Good job, Chuck.

13:18.491 --> 13:22.127
I have a few skills of my own
now, don't I? Humph.

13:23.396 --> 13:24.930
So nine guys, huh?

13:24.997 --> 13:26.331
Really, you're not
fudging that number?

13:26.399 --> 13:28.633
Not even a little bit?
Sounds harder than it is.

13:28.701 --> 13:30.402
Always go for the knee.

13:30.469 --> 13:32.804
You mean like
sweep the leg?

13:41.147 --> 13:42.614
Ooh.
Ooh, I'm sorry.

13:42.682 --> 13:44.416
Excuse me.
That's him.

13:44.483 --> 13:46.017
Well, yeah. You're a little late
to the party.

13:46.085 --> 13:47.953
I just flashed.
No, not Busgang, him.

13:48.020 --> 13:49.454
He was the guy
who was torturing me.

13:49.522 --> 13:50.522
He's Fulcrum.

13:50.590 --> 13:52.724
You two have
a nice evening.

13:52.792 --> 13:54.192
You, too.

13:58.297 --> 13:59.798
Where'd they go?

13:59.865 --> 14:01.666
Where'd they go?

14:01.734 --> 14:02.834
Where'd they go?!

14:02.902 --> 14:04.069
My guess
is that Fulcrum made them,

14:04.136 --> 14:05.070
and they just jammed the signal.

14:07.707 --> 14:10.008
Oh, uh, Dr. Busgang.

14:10.076 --> 14:11.476
I don't believe
we've meet before.

14:11.544 --> 14:12.944
How do you do?

14:13.012 --> 14:14.679
Your friends are in trouble.

14:14.747 --> 14:16.615
I've gathered that.
We have to call General Beckman.

14:16.682 --> 14:18.683
For what?
- So she can tell us what to do next.

14:18.751 --> 14:20.018
I'll tell you
what we do next.

14:20.086 --> 14:22.020
We go to the consulate
and we save them.

14:22.088 --> 14:24.089
No, no, no, no.
Sarah and Casey

14:24.156 --> 14:26.157
specifically said
for us to stay here.

14:26.225 --> 14:28.393
Yeah, well, sometimes things don't
always go according to plan, Chuck.

14:28.461 --> 14:29.427
You have to improvise.

14:29.495 --> 14:30.729
Look, you can't
just go run off

14:30.796 --> 14:32.030
and be the hero
all the time.

14:32.098 --> 14:33.565
It's not about wanting
to be a hero, Chuck.

14:33.633 --> 14:35.100
It's about needing to be.

14:36.702 --> 14:37.802
Two guns, huh?

14:37.870 --> 14:39.270
Oh, you really are a badass.

14:39.338 --> 14:40.605
No, Chuck, one gun.

14:41.841 --> 14:44.676
The other one... is for you.

14:50.816 --> 14:52.150
Let's go.

14:55.539 --> 14:57.307
Normally we stay
in the service arena--

14:57.375 --> 14:58.475
waiter, busboy,
maybe valet.

14:58.542 --> 15:00.510
How about we mix it
up this time?

15:00.578 --> 15:01.811
What do you think
about dentists?

15:01.879 --> 15:03.179
Dentists at a consulate party?

15:03.247 --> 15:04.648
You got a better idea?

15:04.715 --> 15:05.849
I say we go as spies.

15:07.585 --> 15:12.522
It's a little obvious, but
I guess we can do it your way.

15:12.590 --> 15:14.491
...but the data
acquisition problem

15:14.558 --> 15:16.026
in Minsky's
"society-of-mind" theory

15:16.093 --> 15:18.995
was addressed in large part
by Singh's "E-M-One" paper

15:19.063 --> 15:20.997
back in... 2005.

15:21.065 --> 15:22.198
Sounds fascinating.

15:22.266 --> 15:24.134
Mm. Yes. More champagne?

15:24.201 --> 15:26.336
Please.

15:26.404 --> 15:28.738
Radio's still out. Let's grab
this guy and get out of here.

15:28.806 --> 15:30.006
Now, where was I?

15:30.074 --> 15:32.709
You were telling me about
all the wonderful work

15:32.777 --> 15:34.077
you do for the government.
- Right.

15:34.145 --> 15:35.211
That sounds fascinating.

15:35.279 --> 15:36.313
I'd like to hear
about that, too.

15:45.289 --> 15:47.490
You going to knock
him out, too?

15:47.558 --> 15:48.625
There are civilians
everywhere.

15:48.693 --> 15:50.460
We have to find
another way in.

15:53.364 --> 15:56.433
We should have called Beckman,
had her send a team.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.335
And miss out
on all this fun?

15:58.402 --> 15:59.936
Come on, get in
the game, Chuck,

16:00.004 --> 16:01.938
before Fulcrum takes out
your team.

16:07.778 --> 16:09.579
I think they
already have.

16:17.488 --> 16:18.555
Oh, you-you can't be serious.

16:18.622 --> 16:20.156
There's got to be
a ground floor option.

16:20.224 --> 16:22.559
This is good.
We're going up here.

16:22.626 --> 16:24.294
Damn.

16:24.362 --> 16:25.195
Damn it.

16:25.262 --> 16:26.229
Cole, Cole, you're bleeding.

16:26.297 --> 16:27.263
No, I'm fine.

16:27.331 --> 16:28.631
No, you're not.
No, you're not.

16:28.699 --> 16:30.300
Get... get...
What are you doing, Chuck?

16:30.368 --> 16:32.235
What do you mean
what am I doing? I'm doing this.

16:38.676 --> 16:39.743
Duncan, what's with the guns?

16:39.810 --> 16:40.844
Who are these people?

16:40.911 --> 16:42.178
Not your
concern, Howard.

16:42.246 --> 16:44.247
We work for the
government, Dr. Busgang.

16:44.315 --> 16:45.382
So do I.
Tell them, Duncan.

16:45.449 --> 16:46.649
We work for the CIA.

16:46.717 --> 16:48.218
The men you work
for are terrorists.

16:48.285 --> 16:49.919
We're not terrorists.

16:49.987 --> 16:51.488
We're patriots, Howard.

16:51.555 --> 16:52.455
You're a patriot.

16:52.523 --> 16:53.656
It's a group of spies

16:53.724 --> 16:55.258
that turned your back
on the country.

16:55.326 --> 16:56.726
You couldn't have it more wrong.

16:56.794 --> 16:58.995
Who do you think we are?
We do what needs to be done

16:59.063 --> 17:00.597
to preserve this nation's
rightful place in the world.

17:00.664 --> 17:03.666
Someday, you'll thank us.

17:03.734 --> 17:06.703
Well, not you--
you'll be dead.

17:06.771 --> 17:08.771
I swear
I'm just a scientist.

17:08.839 --> 17:10.540
They said I was
helping the country.

17:10.608 --> 17:11.641
Unfortunately, Howard,

17:11.709 --> 17:13.042
that was the wrong
thing to say.

17:19.183 --> 17:20.916
Hey, Cole, Cole, hey!

17:20.984 --> 17:22.318
I found them,
I found them.

17:22.386 --> 17:23.619
The guy who tortured you
is inside

17:23.686 --> 17:25.288
with a couple of other
big goons with guns.

17:25.356 --> 17:28.124
Okay, give me 20 seconds,
then you go in there,

17:28.192 --> 17:29.759
start taking guys out, okay?

17:29.827 --> 17:30.593
No, wait, wait, wait!

17:30.661 --> 17:33.196
Listen, about the whole--

17:33.264 --> 17:34.564
about the whole gun thing--

17:34.632 --> 17:36.232
Casey and Sarah,
they've never really let me--

17:36.300 --> 17:38.501
I don't-- how do I say this?--
I've never fired one.

17:38.569 --> 17:39.869
Chuck, it's point and click.

17:39.937 --> 17:42.005
You point at the bad guys,
pull the trigger.

17:42.073 --> 17:43.640
Yes, I get the whole concept.
Still...

17:43.707 --> 17:44.674
20 seconds.

17:44.742 --> 17:45.809
Wait...

17:53.584 --> 17:54.584
We're dead.

17:54.652 --> 17:56.519
Bartowski's got a gun.

17:58.122 --> 17:59.656
It's a shame, Howard.

17:59.723 --> 18:00.957
Five, six...

18:01.025 --> 18:02.092
You really do have

18:02.159 --> 18:04.060
an incredible mind.

18:05.129 --> 18:06.729
Uh... t-twenty.

18:06.797 --> 18:07.697
Freeze!

18:07.765 --> 18:08.865
Federal Agent!

18:10.401 --> 18:11.668
Ow!

18:12.770 --> 18:13.536
I'm hit!

18:13.604 --> 18:14.737
Man down! Man down!

18:28.519 --> 18:29.319
I'll take care of Chuck.

18:29.386 --> 18:30.086
Get the doctor!

18:38.429 --> 18:38.995
Sarah!

18:47.371 --> 18:48.938
Sorry about that.

18:49.006 --> 18:50.874
I'm really not normally
this aggressive with women.

18:50.941 --> 18:52.041
Oh.

18:52.109 --> 18:53.510
Oh, my God.

18:53.577 --> 18:55.211
You've been shot.

18:55.279 --> 18:56.546
I'm fine.

19:05.589 --> 19:07.190
Gu... Hey! Hey! Hey!

19:07.258 --> 19:08.758
Hey, guys,

19:08.826 --> 19:11.294
I think, uh... I think I might
need medical attention. My ankle

19:11.362 --> 19:13.596
is seriously...

19:13.664 --> 19:15.098
Cole took a bullet
to save Sarah.

19:15.166 --> 19:17.267
Wow. Uh...

19:17.334 --> 19:18.635
You okay, buddy?
What happened?

19:18.702 --> 19:20.136
Nothing.

19:20.204 --> 19:21.971
Nothing. I'm f... I'm fine.

19:24.108 --> 19:26.142
Really. Never mind.

19:28.379 --> 19:30.213
What's that,
mahogany?

19:31.312 --> 19:33.213
You don't look so good.

19:33.280 --> 19:35.281
Can't say the
same for you.

19:37.818 --> 19:39.152
Be gentle now.

19:39.220 --> 19:40.853
I bruise easy.

19:40.921 --> 19:42.689
Well, then maybe
you should consider

19:42.756 --> 19:44.591
taking better care of yourself.

19:44.658 --> 19:46.259
Aah.
- This might hurt a bit.

19:53.367 --> 19:54.968
You know, I've been poked at

19:55.035 --> 19:57.370
by more spook doctors
than I care to remember.

19:57.438 --> 20:00.206
It's nice to be looked after
by someone who treats you

20:00.274 --> 20:02.709
as more than just a name,
rank and serial number.

20:02.776 --> 20:04.143
I know what you mean.

20:04.211 --> 20:05.912
Okay, now, just relax.

20:05.980 --> 20:07.113
Mm.

20:07.181 --> 20:08.281
Aah.

20:08.349 --> 20:10.049
Hold that.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.089
Thanks, doc.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.728
Well, thank you
for saving my life.

20:21.795 --> 20:23.963
What was I gonna do,
not see you again?

20:27.601 --> 20:28.701
Hey.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.036
Howdy. How you doing in here?

20:32.473 --> 20:33.940
Right. Absolutely.
Yeah, sorry about that.

20:34.008 --> 20:36.776
I was just come... coming by to
see if you guys needed anything.

20:36.844 --> 20:38.111
Cole? Soup?

20:38.178 --> 20:40.113
A bisque of some kind?
Or an <i>US Weekly?</i>

20:40.180 --> 20:41.314
I don't read it myself,
but I hear

20:41.382 --> 20:42.415
that when you're sick
or injured...

20:42.483 --> 20:43.650
Walker! Barker!

20:43.717 --> 20:44.817
Bartowski.

20:44.885 --> 20:46.586
Mm-hmm.

20:46.654 --> 20:47.687
Briefing
in five.

20:47.755 --> 20:50.056
Also that briefing in five.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.358
That was kind of
a business thing.

20:52.426 --> 20:53.559
I'll see you in five.

20:53.627 --> 20:54.861
It's like
four-and-a-half now.

20:56.497 --> 20:59.198
Oh, that's the ankle.
That's the ankle.

20:59.266 --> 21:01.267
<i>What are you reading there, sweetie?</i>

21:01.335 --> 21:04.203
Did you know IKEA sells
17 kinds of home shelving?

21:04.271 --> 21:06.172
I can only pronounce
two of them, though.

21:07.441 --> 21:08.741
Isn't it silly?

21:08.809 --> 21:10.877
Listen. You know what?

21:10.944 --> 21:12.712
I wanted to apologize
about last night

21:12.780 --> 21:14.147
and the whole
Wimbledon thing.

21:14.214 --> 21:16.749
I guess I was just trying
to set some boundaries

21:16.817 --> 21:18.551
before we move in,
and I realize

21:18.619 --> 21:20.920
there is a more mature
way to handle this.

21:20.988 --> 21:24.190
You know? So, uh,
well, there you go.

21:24.258 --> 21:25.958
A Morgan nuptial?
- Right.

21:26.026 --> 21:28.227
I had Lester's cousin
draw it up for us.

21:28.295 --> 21:29.495
A little something

21:29.563 --> 21:30.697
to ensure that there are no

21:30.764 --> 21:32.632
cohabitating conflicts.

21:32.700 --> 21:33.800
No pets?

21:33.867 --> 21:35.001
What about Chico?

21:35.069 --> 21:36.936
Oh, that's right. Chico.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.971
I guess you have to
put him down now, huh?

21:39.039 --> 21:42.275
The only cheese allowed
in the house is string.

21:42.343 --> 21:43.609
Or gouda.

21:43.677 --> 21:44.811
On weekends.

21:44.878 --> 21:46.145
Are you insane?

21:46.213 --> 21:49.082
Just a teensy-weensy
bit particular.

21:49.149 --> 21:50.850
And listen to me.

21:50.918 --> 21:53.386
I would totally understand if
you're having second thoughts.

21:53.454 --> 21:54.587
Are you kidding me?

21:54.655 --> 21:55.988
Morgan, you're hilarious.

21:56.056 --> 21:57.790
I'll sign
whatever you want.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.325
Maybe it makes
me nuts, too, but

21:59.393 --> 22:00.760
I love you,

22:00.828 --> 22:03.062
ridiculous quirks and all.

22:03.130 --> 22:04.797
I should have
that framed.

22:04.865 --> 22:07.767
Totally.

22:07.835 --> 22:09.869
Damn it.

22:09.937 --> 22:12.238
I should have went
with provolone.

22:12.306 --> 22:13.473
Mr. Barker, I understand

22:13.540 --> 22:14.941
you were hurt
protecting Agent Walker.

22:15.008 --> 22:16.843
I am told you showed
great courage.

22:16.910 --> 22:18.378
Just doing my job, General.

22:18.445 --> 22:19.946
Actually, it was Chuck
who showed great courage

22:20.013 --> 22:22.048
on this mission.
He was also injured

22:22.116 --> 22:23.950
in the line of duty.
He got clipped by a

22:24.017 --> 22:25.184
window sill.

22:25.252 --> 22:26.619
It's as pathetic as it sounds.

22:26.687 --> 22:28.354
Is there any new intel
on Busgang

22:28.422 --> 22:29.822
or his FULCRUM handler,
General?

22:29.890 --> 22:32.158
We now know that the man
Chuck identified last night,

22:32.226 --> 22:35.328
Dr. Howard Busgang, is in fact
codenamed Perseus.

22:35.396 --> 22:36.896
He is a former DARPA scientist

22:36.964 --> 22:38.331
who worked
on the original Intersect.

22:38.399 --> 22:41.434
Uh, why was that information
not in my flash?

22:41.502 --> 22:43.903
As a safety precaution,
anything about the creators

22:43.971 --> 22:45.872
of the Intersect
was redacted from our files.

22:45.939 --> 22:47.173
I'm sorry.
Did you just say

22:47.241 --> 22:48.408
this guy created the Intersect?

22:48.475 --> 22:50.076
He was part of the team

22:50.144 --> 22:51.744
that developed its underlying
architecture.

22:51.812 --> 22:53.413
He knows as much
about how it works as anyone.

22:53.480 --> 22:57.116
That means he might know
how to get it out of my head.

22:57.184 --> 22:59.018
We don't know, Chuck.

22:59.086 --> 23:01.687
But it's possible?

23:01.755 --> 23:02.989
Perhaps.

23:07.394 --> 23:08.661
We got to find him.

23:08.729 --> 23:10.329
We got to find this guy
before FULCRUM does.

23:10.397 --> 23:12.899
We are putting every available
resource on it, Chuck.

23:12.966 --> 23:15.034
Agents Walker and Casey,
prepare for a video link.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.603
You're going to brief our field
agents, bring them up to speed.

23:17.671 --> 23:19.071
Good luck.

23:19.139 --> 23:20.239
Roger that.

23:20.307 --> 23:21.240
Oh, let me...

23:29.383 --> 23:32.418
Hey, what are you
looking at there?

23:32.486 --> 23:35.922
Oh, just, you know,
footage from the consulate.

23:35.989 --> 23:37.890
Maybe there's
something I missed.

23:37.958 --> 23:40.927
You did great
tonight, Chuck.

23:40.994 --> 23:42.528
Thanks.

23:42.596 --> 23:45.431
You were your usual
superhuman self.

23:45.499 --> 23:48.034
You saved Sarah's life.

23:48.101 --> 23:50.970
No.

23:51.038 --> 23:52.672
It was a team effort.

23:52.739 --> 23:54.774
I get what she sees in you,
you know.

23:54.842 --> 23:57.076
The fearlessness
in the face of danger,

23:57.144 --> 23:58.744
the imperviousness
to pain.

23:58.812 --> 24:00.279
super-cool tank tops.

24:00.347 --> 24:02.081
Stop me whenever this is
getting uncomfortable.

24:02.149 --> 24:03.683
No.

24:03.750 --> 24:06.385
Hey. The briefing
is about to start.

24:06.453 --> 24:07.720
Great. I'll be right there.

24:07.788 --> 24:09.322
On my way.

24:09.389 --> 24:10.423
Oh, you meant him.

24:10.491 --> 24:13.092
Of course you meant him.
- What?

24:13.160 --> 24:15.127
Right.

24:21.468 --> 24:23.703
My God, could she really be...

24:23.770 --> 24:26.906
Un-repulseable?

24:26.974 --> 24:28.674
I'm beginning
to think so.

24:28.742 --> 24:29.909
No, sir.

24:29.977 --> 24:31.477
Not on my watch.

24:31.545 --> 24:33.346
What are you suggesting?
- Mm-mmm.

24:33.413 --> 24:36.115
You're going to need a quart of
peanut oil, some bubble-wrap,

24:36.183 --> 24:38.551
and as much yarn
as you can find.

24:38.619 --> 24:39.785
Hey, guys.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.020
Hey, Morgan, we need to talk.

24:41.088 --> 24:42.488
Yeah. Hey,
what's going on?

24:42.556 --> 24:43.789
And what's with the limp?

24:43.857 --> 24:45.992
Nothing. No, I
twisted my ankle.

24:46.059 --> 24:47.660
Ooh.
Yeah. Jogging.

24:47.728 --> 24:48.794
Which I do,
occasionally. I'm fine.

24:48.862 --> 24:50.029
We need to talk about...

24:50.097 --> 24:51.197
About the Anna situation?

24:51.265 --> 24:52.331
Not a problem,
Charles.

24:52.399 --> 24:53.866
We are on it.

24:53.934 --> 24:55.468
You are looking at three
individuals gifted

24:55.536 --> 24:56.636
in the art
of repulsion.

24:56.703 --> 24:58.371
Anna doesn't
stand a chance.

24:58.438 --> 25:00.239
Why are you trying
to repulse Anna?

25:00.307 --> 25:02.308
No, no, no. Lester,
that's ridiculous.

25:02.376 --> 25:04.510
What I was trying to do
was simply test her.

25:04.578 --> 25:06.812
That's all.
- Testing her, why?

25:06.880 --> 25:09.882
Because, Chuck, because she's
trying to get all serious

25:09.950 --> 25:11.617
with me, and

25:11.685 --> 25:14.687
I want to make sure that
she loves me for me and not...

25:14.755 --> 25:16.689
Other things.

25:16.757 --> 25:17.924
Excuse us.

25:17.991 --> 25:20.927
Are you crazy?

25:20.994 --> 25:24.530
What other things could she
possibly be loving you for?

25:24.598 --> 25:25.965
I mean, honestly, buddy.

25:26.033 --> 25:27.833
You know that I love you,
but-but you're lucky

25:27.901 --> 25:31.437
to have a girl in your life
who loves you for you,

25:31.505 --> 25:37.209
even though you are,
in fact... you.

25:37.277 --> 25:38.878
Fair.

25:38.946 --> 25:40.246
I you don't stop
testing her,

25:40.314 --> 25:42.248
she's going to choose to
be with someone else.

25:42.316 --> 25:45.551
And then you will have realized,
and unfortunately, too late,

25:45.619 --> 25:47.653
that you lost the
catch of a lifetime.

25:51.391 --> 25:53.926
Counterpoint: she's not
the catch of a lifetime.

25:53.994 --> 25:55.094
She's a scheming tart

25:55.162 --> 25:56.329
who will harvest your organs

25:56.396 --> 25:57.797
and sell them
to the highest bidder.

26:01.001 --> 26:02.802
Chuck's right.

26:02.869 --> 26:04.103
Lester wrong.

26:09.509 --> 26:10.576
Chuck.

26:10.644 --> 26:11.844
What happened?

26:11.912 --> 26:13.312
Nothing. It's
a flesh wound.

26:13.380 --> 26:14.447
It's nothing.
I'm fine.

26:14.514 --> 26:16.449
Well, let's see.
Sit down.

26:16.516 --> 26:18.117
Up, up.

26:18.185 --> 26:20.119
Sorry, sorry.
Devon, can you help?

26:20.187 --> 26:22.088
Please promise not to go
all crazy Dr. Sister on me.

26:22.155 --> 26:23.623
What's up, babe?

26:23.690 --> 26:25.124
We need to get Chuck
to the hospital.

26:25.192 --> 26:26.892
We got to X-ray this leg.
- No, we don't. I'm fine.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.362
Pretty swollen there.

26:29.429 --> 26:30.997
I'm actually a lot tougher
than people think I am.

26:31.064 --> 26:32.331
I know you are, buddy.

26:32.399 --> 26:33.633
Sometimes it takes a real man

26:33.700 --> 26:34.900
to admit when you're hurt.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.402
Ouch.

26:36.470 --> 26:37.737
That actually hurt.

26:37.804 --> 26:40.506
I didn't think
anything hurt you.

26:40.574 --> 26:42.508
Oh, no, there
are some things.

26:42.576 --> 26:44.944
The clinical disinterest
of a beautiful woman,

26:45.012 --> 26:46.712
for instance.

26:48.682 --> 26:50.950
Any word on Busgang?

26:51.018 --> 26:52.284
Not yet.

26:52.352 --> 26:53.886
Casey and I are headed
to the airport.

26:53.954 --> 26:55.988
They think Busgang might
try to leave the country.

26:59.459 --> 27:00.626
All right, then.

27:00.694 --> 27:02.561
Rest up.

27:05.098 --> 27:06.165
Wait.

27:06.233 --> 27:08.534
Listen.

27:08.602 --> 27:10.436
You know, I meant
what I said earlier

27:10.504 --> 27:12.738
about being around people
who really care about you

27:12.806 --> 27:15.541
and who you really
care about.

27:15.609 --> 27:18.110
It doesn't happen often
for people like us.

27:18.178 --> 27:20.346
No. It doesn't.

27:24.651 --> 27:27.019
What if we're lucky enough
to find that person?

27:28.789 --> 27:30.589
We're supposed to
just walk away?

27:30.657 --> 27:33.793
Doesn't seem
fair, does it?

27:35.829 --> 27:36.962
No.

27:40.400 --> 27:43.335
Because it isn't.

27:48.742 --> 27:50.943
Is the cast
absolutely necessary?

27:51.011 --> 27:52.111
Yes.

27:52.179 --> 27:53.279
It could be a hairline fracture.

27:53.346 --> 27:54.480
Better safe than sorry.

27:54.548 --> 27:56.382
I'm going to go
find you some crutches.

27:56.450 --> 27:58.484
No, absolutely not.

27:58.552 --> 27:59.819
I want to be
released immediately.

27:59.886 --> 28:00.786
I'm sorry, sir.

28:00.854 --> 28:01.954
This is a gunshot wound.

28:02.022 --> 28:03.255
We have to report this.

28:03.323 --> 28:04.490
This is outrageous.

28:04.558 --> 28:05.925
I don't care
about your rules.

28:05.992 --> 28:06.992
I don't care about
what you have to do.

28:07.060 --> 28:08.260
I'm leaving now.

28:08.328 --> 28:09.862
Sir, I highly suggest
you stay overnight

28:09.930 --> 28:10.996
in case your leg
gets infected.

28:11.064 --> 28:12.131
I can't do that.

28:12.199 --> 28:15.034
I have to go.

28:15.102 --> 28:17.036
Yeah.

28:17.104 --> 28:19.105
Casey, it's Chuck.
Look, I found Busgang.

28:19.172 --> 28:21.240
He's here at the hospital.
Westside Medical.

28:21.308 --> 28:22.775
You found him. Great work.
All right.

28:22.843 --> 28:24.076
We'll have a strike team there

28:24.144 --> 28:25.711
in a half an hour.
No, no, no. He's leaving.

28:25.779 --> 28:27.747
Don't follow him, Chuck.
It's too dangerous.

28:27.814 --> 28:28.881
He might know
how to get the Intersect

28:28.949 --> 28:30.249
out of my head.
I can't let him go.

28:30.317 --> 28:32.451
Listen to me. Do not
go after him on your own.

28:32.519 --> 28:34.053
Do not be a hero here, Chuck.

28:34.121 --> 28:35.821
Look, I don't want to be a hero,

28:35.889 --> 28:39.225
but sometimes, you need to be.

28:39.292 --> 28:42.228
Besides, this is doable.

28:56.409 --> 28:58.244
I've got them both.

29:25.412 --> 29:27.247
Hi. Hi.

29:27.314 --> 29:28.348
I'm looking
for Mr. Busgang.

29:28.415 --> 29:29.482
Do you have
an appointment?

29:29.550 --> 29:30.683
No.

29:30.751 --> 29:31.684
Yeah, well.

29:31.752 --> 29:32.886
Uh, the thing is, see,

29:32.953 --> 29:34.053
I'm a computer tech.

29:34.121 --> 29:35.221
Um, Nerd Herd.

29:35.289 --> 29:36.356
That's me.

29:36.423 --> 29:37.690
And apparently,

29:37.758 --> 29:39.559
Mr. Busgang has some
major hardware problems.

29:39.627 --> 29:41.761
Constellation Science,
second floor.

29:41.829 --> 29:43.563
Thank you.

29:55.309 --> 29:57.210
Can I help
you gentlemen?

30:57.004 --> 30:58.705
Turn around.

30:58.772 --> 31:00.640
Slowly.

31:03.177 --> 31:04.711
You're the guy who shot me.

31:04.778 --> 31:06.479
It was an accident, I swear.
It was the first time

31:06.547 --> 31:07.714
I had ever handled a gun

31:07.781 --> 31:09.082
and the first time that
I had shot someone.

31:09.149 --> 31:10.850
Clearly those two things
must be connected

31:10.918 --> 31:11.818
in some way.
- Hi. I'm Chuck.

31:25.232 --> 31:28.901
Sit down
and don't move.

31:28.969 --> 31:30.570
I need to accidentally
shoot you.

31:30.638 --> 31:31.738
I didn't come to hurt you

31:31.805 --> 31:33.072
or even take you in.

31:33.140 --> 31:34.741
I just want some answers
about the Intersect.

31:37.211 --> 31:38.478
What do you know
about the Intersect?

31:38.545 --> 31:41.180
A lot, actually.

31:41.248 --> 31:42.915
Who are you?

31:54.361 --> 31:55.895
Orion.

32:00.167 --> 32:01.868
Did you just flash?

32:06.407 --> 32:09.242
Cover the stairs.

32:14.448 --> 32:16.082
You're the one they've been
talking about, aren't you?

32:18.552 --> 32:20.453
I didn't believe
it could be true.

32:20.521 --> 32:22.955
A human Intersect.

32:24.658 --> 32:26.092
Extraordinary.

32:26.160 --> 32:29.028
Maybe for you.

32:29.096 --> 32:31.364
But you have to understand,
for me...

32:31.432 --> 32:32.965
For me, it's a nightmare.

32:33.033 --> 32:35.635
Living with this
thing in my head

32:35.703 --> 32:37.937
is ruining my life.

32:40.207 --> 32:42.475
Is there any way th-that

32:42.543 --> 32:44.844
Intersect images
can be taken out?

32:44.912 --> 32:46.412
You know, can a person
be "de-Intersected"?

32:46.480 --> 32:49.148
Can it be removed?

32:49.216 --> 32:50.049
Possibly.

32:51.985 --> 32:53.619
I don't know.

32:53.687 --> 32:54.954
Only Orion would know.

32:55.022 --> 32:56.889
Orion? Who is Orion?

32:56.957 --> 32:59.292
It was his idea, his vision.

32:59.359 --> 33:01.561
Everything is based
on his work.

33:01.628 --> 33:02.762
He put the team together,

33:02.830 --> 33:04.664
he drove the research,

33:04.732 --> 33:06.299
until he realized--

33:06.366 --> 33:07.467
Put the gun down, Howard.

33:07.534 --> 33:09.135
Who's Orion?
Where can I find him?

33:09.203 --> 33:10.737
Please! I need to know!

33:11.905 --> 33:14.173
Split up!

33:15.976 --> 33:16.943
I haven't told him anything.

33:17.978 --> 33:19.345
No! No!

33:29.556 --> 33:30.890
That's the second time
you've shot me.

33:30.958 --> 33:32.225
Let's hope
the third time's the charm.

33:32.292 --> 33:33.693
Sweep the leg.

33:42.536 --> 33:44.704
Hey, are you okay?

33:44.772 --> 33:46.405
I'm fine. The gun.
- What?

33:46.473 --> 33:47.740
Chuck, the gun!

33:47.808 --> 33:48.741
Oh, help!

33:55.415 --> 33:56.616
Are you okay?

33:56.683 --> 33:57.583
Yeah, I think so!

33:57.651 --> 33:59.152
I think so.

33:59.219 --> 34:01.053
Oh, you were, you
were talking to him.

34:01.121 --> 34:02.021
I thought you were
asking if I was okay

34:02.089 --> 34:03.322
but you're talking to him

34:03.390 --> 34:04.524
Because he's been
shot again, right.

34:04.591 --> 34:05.625
My bad.

34:05.692 --> 34:07.360
No, I was talking
to both of you.

34:07.427 --> 34:08.795
We're okay, right?
We're okay.

34:08.862 --> 34:10.763
Yeah... right.

34:13.233 --> 34:15.701
Absolutely, we're okay.

34:15.885 --> 34:17.351
Excellent work, team.

34:17.418 --> 34:19.420
While we would have preferred
to take Busgang alive,

34:19.487 --> 34:21.623
by capturing his work
we've significantly set back

34:21.690 --> 34:23.757
Fulcrum's ability to build
their own Intersect.

34:23.826 --> 34:25.994
Uh, what about that name? Orion?

34:26.061 --> 34:27.896
Busgang said that
Orion could maybe get

34:27.963 --> 34:29.063
the Intersect
out of my head.

34:29.130 --> 34:30.697
As of now, we have no leads,

34:30.766 --> 34:32.934
but our best people are on it.

34:33.002 --> 34:35.069
Agent Barker,
medical transport for you

34:35.137 --> 34:36.538
back to the U.K.
has been arranged.

34:36.605 --> 34:38.873
Thank you, General.

34:38.940 --> 34:42.177
So, it seems my work
here is done... again.

34:42.244 --> 34:44.312
Agent Casey,
it's been

34:44.380 --> 34:45.612
a real pleasure
working with you.

34:45.681 --> 34:46.781
Yeah, likewise.

34:46.849 --> 34:48.349
Can I ask you something?

34:48.417 --> 34:50.318
When you escaped from Fulcrum,
you really take out nine guys?

34:50.386 --> 34:51.786
The truth?

34:51.853 --> 34:53.121
Professional courtesy.

34:54.322 --> 34:55.690
It was more like 12.

34:55.757 --> 34:56.958
I just don't like to boast.

35:01.730 --> 35:04.599
Hey, so, what's next?

35:04.667 --> 35:07.135
Wing back to London
and jam with The Stones?

35:07.203 --> 35:09.737
I have to say, Chuck,
you are truly the most

35:09.805 --> 35:12.740
special agent I've
ever worked with.

35:14.043 --> 35:15.476
Special.

35:15.544 --> 35:19.214
Good luck with getting
that thing out of your head.

35:19.281 --> 35:21.249
Thanks, but, uh, I'm
beginning to think

35:21.317 --> 35:23.518
that's never
going to happen.

35:23.586 --> 35:25.820
You know what?

35:25.888 --> 35:28.656
I got a not-so-secret
secret for you.

35:28.724 --> 35:29.991
You want something
bad enough,

35:30.059 --> 35:32.627
don't ever take no
for an answer.

35:32.695 --> 35:35.196
And...

35:35.264 --> 35:36.831
for God sakes, man,
carry a gun.

35:36.899 --> 35:38.967
Maybe two.

35:53.782 --> 35:54.682
Wow.

35:54.750 --> 35:55.984
Nice cast.

35:56.051 --> 35:57.285
Ellie go to work on you?

35:57.353 --> 35:58.620
Yeah, yeah.

35:58.687 --> 35:59.854
I'm just happy
it's not full body.

36:01.957 --> 36:04.092
Morgan, we gotta talk about
the whole moving-in thing.

36:04.159 --> 36:05.493
I know we do.

36:05.561 --> 36:08.196
Chuck, I just don't know
how to say this. I...

36:08.264 --> 36:09.631
You should have a seat.

36:09.698 --> 36:11.532
Okay.

36:13.636 --> 36:17.772
Sometimes things happen
between, uh, two people

36:17.840 --> 36:20.575
who care about
each other very much.

36:20.643 --> 36:25.713
Um, and it doesn't mean that
they don't belong together.

36:25.781 --> 36:26.948
Belong together?

36:27.016 --> 36:28.283
What are you talking about?

36:28.350 --> 36:29.817
Uh, no, no, no.

36:30.986 --> 36:32.820
I can't move in with you, Chuck,

36:32.888 --> 36:34.522
because I'm going to
move in with Anna.

36:34.590 --> 36:36.090
She loves me

36:36.158 --> 36:37.792
and she wants to
move in with me.

36:37.860 --> 36:39.327
And I want to make her happy.

36:39.395 --> 36:40.928
But I want you
to understand.

36:40.996 --> 36:42.764
I do, buddy.

36:42.831 --> 36:44.465
Seriously, I totally
understand and furthermore,

36:44.533 --> 36:46.634
I think that you are absolutely

36:46.702 --> 36:48.102
making the right decision.

36:48.170 --> 36:50.171
Whew, that's awesome.
Thank you.

36:50.239 --> 36:52.006
She gonna be okay with
your string cheese habit?

36:52.074 --> 36:55.376
I know she will be, bro.

36:55.444 --> 36:57.979
Hey, and, uh, you and I,

36:58.047 --> 37:00.415
you know, we'll still be...

37:00.482 --> 37:01.949
friends?

37:02.017 --> 37:03.084
As opposed to what?

37:03.152 --> 37:05.753
That's an excellent point.

37:05.821 --> 37:08.890
Okay.

37:12.895 --> 37:16.230
Dr. Walker, my superiors agree

37:16.298 --> 37:21.035
that I need 24-hour round-
the-clock medical assistance.

37:21.103 --> 37:24.472
Our jet awaits.

37:24.540 --> 37:26.474
I'm sorry, I have
yogurt to serve.

37:26.542 --> 37:28.710
You'll have to find somebody
else to take care of you.

37:28.777 --> 37:30.712
Now, now, you see,
that's not going to work

37:30.779 --> 37:34.148
because no one else is gonna
make me feel like you do.

37:34.216 --> 37:38.453
Believe me, I've looked.

37:38.520 --> 37:40.988
I'm serious.

37:41.056 --> 37:42.890
Don't pack your bags,
don't say good-byes,

37:42.958 --> 37:45.693
just close your
eyes and say yes.

37:45.761 --> 37:47.595
Come with me, Sarah.

37:49.865 --> 37:51.799
I'm sorry.

37:55.537 --> 37:56.938
What's the matter?

37:57.005 --> 37:59.640
I thought you were a girl
who liked adventure.

37:59.708 --> 38:00.908
I guess I'm not the kind of girl

38:00.976 --> 38:02.477
who cheats on her
cover boyfriend.

38:02.544 --> 38:05.113
Is that all he is?
A cover?

38:05.180 --> 38:07.248
What do you mean?

38:07.316 --> 38:08.783
I saw the way
you looked at him

38:08.851 --> 38:10.651
when his life was in danger.

38:10.719 --> 38:12.787
I've been doing this
a long time, Agent Walker.

38:19.294 --> 38:22.597
Well, who'd have thought it.

38:22.664 --> 38:24.966
Cole Barker loses the girl
to Chuck Bartowski.

38:28.871 --> 38:30.738
When you meet somebody
you care about,

38:30.806 --> 38:32.640
it's just hard to walk away.

38:37.246 --> 38:39.814
I couldn't have said it
better myself.

38:59.168 --> 39:02.170
# #

39:12.581 --> 39:14.282
How's your foot?

39:14.349 --> 39:15.983
Uh, throbbing.

39:16.051 --> 39:17.785
Thanks.

39:17.853 --> 39:19.554
Did Cole leave?

39:19.621 --> 39:21.556
Uh, mm-hmm.

39:21.623 --> 39:23.658
He's quite a guy.

39:23.725 --> 39:26.294
Uh, yeah.

39:26.361 --> 39:27.862
That he is.

39:30.299 --> 39:31.799
You know, I understand
what you see in him.

39:31.867 --> 39:34.268
He's a great spy.

39:34.336 --> 39:36.304
Top of good guys.

39:36.371 --> 39:38.539
The truth is, you two
would make a great team.

39:38.607 --> 39:39.807
Chuck...

39:39.875 --> 39:43.044
Please, let me just finish.

39:49.384 --> 39:50.852
Sarah, I'm not gonna
move in with you.

39:54.122 --> 39:55.356
Because I can't.

39:55.424 --> 39:58.226
And you know
why I can't.

40:00.128 --> 40:01.696
I'm crazy about you,

40:01.763 --> 40:03.998
and I've always been.

40:04.066 --> 40:06.334
But you know, having a fake
relationship, that's one thing.

40:06.401 --> 40:08.269
But living together is...

40:11.240 --> 40:13.374
I mean, every day being
around each other and-and...

40:17.045 --> 40:20.047
And that's why I can't do it.

40:20.115 --> 40:22.884
And I hope you understand.

40:22.951 --> 40:25.386
I do.

40:25.454 --> 40:28.122
Thank you.

40:32.027 --> 40:35.129
Oh, and, uh,
just so you know,

40:35.197 --> 40:37.331
I am going to
get this thing

40:37.399 --> 40:40.201
out of my head one day.

40:40.269 --> 40:41.602
I will.

40:41.670 --> 40:43.638
And when I do,
I'm going to live

40:43.705 --> 40:45.640
the life that I want
with the girl that I love.

40:45.707 --> 40:48.075
Because I'm not going to let
this thing rob me of that.

40:48.143 --> 40:50.478
I won't.

41:01.990 --> 41:04.191
Hey, how's the ankle?

41:04.259 --> 41:05.593
I picked up some
boxes in case

41:05.661 --> 41:07.028
you wanted to start
packing up your room.

41:07.095 --> 41:09.063
Change of plans, not
moving out, talk later.
