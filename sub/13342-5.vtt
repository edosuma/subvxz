WEBVTT

01:07.417 --> 01:10.750
- Adam: Hannah?
- Mm-hmm?

01:10.750 --> 01:13.083
You want another
glass of water?

01:13.083 --> 01:14.917
No.

01:17.166 --> 01:20.458
Okay, I was gonna go get
a cold-pressed juice,

01:20.458 --> 01:22.375
so I will let you two
catch up

01:22.375 --> 01:23.834
and I will
be back shortly.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.959
Or not shortly
or whenever anyone
contacts me.

01:26.959 --> 01:29.500
- Okay, cool.
- Yeah, cool.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.542
Would anyone like
a juice or a tea?

01:31.542 --> 01:33.375
Actually, I could do
an apple juice
if you could--

01:33.375 --> 01:35.542
No, thank you,
Mimi-Rose.

01:39.625 --> 01:42.667
( door opens, closes )

01:42.667 --> 01:44.000
You okay?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.959
Me?

01:45.959 --> 01:47.750
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

01:47.750 --> 01:50.000
Oh, 'cause I woke up
in an alternate universe

01:50.000 --> 01:51.667
where up is down
and right is wrong?

01:51.667 --> 01:54.583
No, no,
it's completely fine.

01:54.583 --> 01:56.000
I'm sorry, this must
be fuckin' weird,

01:56.000 --> 01:57.333
but if I knew
you were coming home--

01:57.333 --> 01:59.583
What, you wouldn't
have had a girlfriend?

01:59.583 --> 02:01.875
No, I would've--
I would've warned you.

02:03.708 --> 02:05.500
It's just something
we're trying out.

02:05.500 --> 02:09.041
You were in love
with me a month ago.

02:09.041 --> 02:10.708
Yes, I know.

02:10.708 --> 02:14.000
It all happened
in a very unexpected way.

02:15.875 --> 02:17.583
I didn't break any rules.

02:17.583 --> 02:19.041
Nope, you didn't
break any rules,

02:19.041 --> 02:22.458
except maybe the rule
of common human decency,
Adam.

02:22.458 --> 02:24.959
Look, you made
the choice to leave.
You did that. I didn't do that.

02:24.959 --> 02:28.083
- Who the fuck is she?
- Her name is Mimi-Rose Howard.
She-- ( stammers )

02:28.083 --> 02:31.208
That's not a name.
That's just a woman's name
and a man's name

02:31.208 --> 02:32.708
with a flower stuck
in the middle of it.

02:32.708 --> 02:36.708
I mean, seriously?
She's living in my
fuckin' apartment?

02:36.708 --> 02:38.583
Actually,
you left it to me.

02:38.583 --> 02:42.000
Left it to you?
Adam, I'm not dead.

02:43.583 --> 02:45.625
And now all
my fuckin' stuff is gone.

02:45.625 --> 02:46.708
Where's all my stuff?

02:46.708 --> 02:49.875
I got you a storage unit
in Fort Greene.

02:53.750 --> 02:56.625
That I paid for.

02:56.625 --> 02:59.417
Wow, thank you,
Mr. Rockefeller.

02:59.417 --> 03:01.667
Another grand
romantic gesture

03:01.667 --> 03:03.750
from the last
of the red hot lovers.

03:03.750 --> 03:08.417
Hannah, I want
you to understand,
this isn't about you.

03:08.417 --> 03:12.041
You know what, Adam?
I think I really understand
that part.

03:14.959 --> 03:17.083
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm very tired from my journey

03:17.083 --> 03:19.750
and I'm gonna go take
a little rest in my room.

03:21.083 --> 03:22.917
Oh, okay.

03:24.083 --> 03:25.750
Um...

03:26.792 --> 03:30.166
( music playing )

03:30.166 --> 03:31.750
Okay.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.208
Hey, Desi, it's Adam.

03:45.208 --> 03:47.250
Uh, Adam Sackler.
You know me.

03:47.250 --> 03:49.708
Listen, if you talk to Marnie,
could you have her
give me a call

03:49.708 --> 03:52.166
or just come to my place--
Hannah's place?

03:52.166 --> 03:55.959
Um, okay,
end of message.

03:59.708 --> 04:02.625
Maybe we should just leave
and let her stay here.

04:02.625 --> 04:04.417
No, no, you don't
know Hannah.

04:04.417 --> 04:06.333
She'll stay in there
until we have a new president.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.917
She's stubborn as fuck
and likes to be in bed a lot.

04:08.917 --> 04:10.917
Would it help
if I talk to her?

04:10.917 --> 04:13.166
I'm really good
in a crisis.

04:13.166 --> 04:15.792
No fuckin' way.

04:15.792 --> 04:17.666
( knock on door )

04:21.625 --> 04:24.125
Oh, hi.
Marnie, right?

04:24.125 --> 04:27.333
No, not right,
and I don't know who you are
and I don't care to know.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.875
And that is all
I have to say about it.

04:28.875 --> 04:31.083
- Is she in here?
- Yes.

04:31.083 --> 04:34.333
- ( door closes )
- ( knocks softly )

04:34.333 --> 04:36.208
Banana?

04:36.208 --> 04:38.458
Hannah:
Mm-hmm?

04:40.417 --> 04:42.166
Oh, my God.

04:42.166 --> 04:44.250
- Hi.
- ( door closes )

04:44.250 --> 04:45.333
Hi, Shosh.

04:45.333 --> 04:48.291
- Can they hear us in here?
- I don't know.

04:48.291 --> 04:50.667
Oh, my God,
what is that?

04:52.417 --> 04:54.834
Some hideous tapestry

04:54.834 --> 04:58.708
that never would've been here
had I lived here because--

04:58.708 --> 05:02.208
What the fuck?
What?

05:02.208 --> 05:04.625
Okay, you definitely
need to call your super.

05:04.625 --> 05:07.166
This is something
Adam and I always
talked about, you know?

05:07.166 --> 05:09.625
Making a master suite
with our bare hands.

05:09.625 --> 05:12.708
And now it's here
and I have nothing
to do with it.

05:12.708 --> 05:15.500
Okay, Hannah, I understand
this is about your pain

05:15.500 --> 05:17.375
and your devastation, totally,
and I'm gonna get you

05:17.375 --> 05:19.333
a hot cup of tea for that
like in just a mo,

05:19.333 --> 05:21.625
but am I the only one
who doesn't know about this?

05:21.625 --> 05:23.917
We loved each other, Shosh.

05:23.917 --> 05:26.917
We loved each other,
and nothing has changed, okay?

05:26.917 --> 05:28.750
I'm the same person I was
when he loved me.

05:28.750 --> 05:31.000
In fact, I'm an arguably
better person

05:31.000 --> 05:33.041
because I went away
and figured out what I want.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.583
Hannah, we are going
to get through this.

05:35.583 --> 05:37.291
- I want to die.
- No, you don't.

05:37.291 --> 05:40.166
You and me and Jessa
and/or slash Marnie,

05:40.166 --> 05:42.291
we are going to get
through this together.

05:42.291 --> 05:43.625
If they ever show up
or call back.

05:43.625 --> 05:46.875
Also, you have
absolutely lost weight,
and that is a definite.

05:46.875 --> 05:48.458
Yes, two and a half pounds.

05:48.458 --> 05:49.834
Yeah, I know.
That's a lot.

05:49.834 --> 05:52.250
Um, we need to find out
every possible detail

05:52.250 --> 05:54.375
about this rando hussy
immediately.

05:54.375 --> 05:56.250
My laptop's in my bag.

05:56.250 --> 05:57.583
Okay, what's her name again?

05:57.583 --> 05:59.041
Mimi-Rose Howard.

05:59.041 --> 06:00.291
Ew, of course it is.

06:00.291 --> 06:04.917
- ( keyboard clicking )
- Mimi dash Rose space Howard.

06:04.917 --> 06:06.250
I don't know
if I want to do this.

06:06.250 --> 06:08.959
I don't want to be
this woman-googling person.

06:08.959 --> 06:10.083
Okay.

06:13.083 --> 06:17.458
( imitates missile
falling, exploding )

06:19.625 --> 06:22.750
Rhode Island
School of Design,
2007 BFA.

06:22.750 --> 06:27.458
- BFA in what?
- Fine Arts, whatever, with
an emphasis on sculpture.

06:27.458 --> 06:28.625
Um, wait.
Holy shit.

06:28.625 --> 06:31.458
"Mimi-Rose Howard visiting
artist keynote address"?

06:31.458 --> 06:32.750
Wait.
Okay, I wanna see this.

06:32.750 --> 06:34.792
You know what?
I don't think that
we should watch this.

06:34.792 --> 06:37.041
How many of you remember
your first love?

06:37.041 --> 06:39.125
Hands.

06:39.125 --> 06:40.917
Yes, me, too.

06:40.917 --> 06:44.166
When I was nine, I fell in love
for the first time.

06:44.166 --> 06:46.875
The minute I saw Peter,
I knew he would be mine.

06:46.875 --> 06:49.041
Okay, you know what?
We're not watching this.

06:49.041 --> 06:50.959
- It was a bad idea.
- No, I wanna finish it.
I need to finish it.

06:50.959 --> 06:52.208
I just really think
that it's not a good idea.

06:52.208 --> 06:55.750
- I need
to finish it, Shoshanna.
- I think that it-- no!

06:58.166 --> 07:00.041
You know what I think
would be a good idea?

07:00.041 --> 07:01.750
If you and I went
to my lodgings

07:01.750 --> 07:04.291
and I made you
that warm mug of tea
that we were talking about.

07:04.291 --> 07:07.041
- And maybe you took a bath.
- No, thank you.

07:07.041 --> 07:09.083
Bye, Shosh.
Thank you for stopping by.

07:09.083 --> 07:12.542
I just think that this
is really not a safe space--
oh, my God.

07:12.542 --> 07:14.166
Okay, you just boob hit me
with your foot.

07:14.166 --> 07:16.583
- Oh, my God.
- I'm okay.

07:16.583 --> 07:18.667
I just want to be alone.

07:22.458 --> 07:24.583
I think she just needs
some time to digest this.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.667
- Does she need to do it here?
- Uh, it seems like it,

07:26.667 --> 07:29.166
but all will be revealed
in the fullness of time.

07:30.708 --> 07:32.625
I can't believe
you called her first.

07:32.625 --> 07:34.333
I didn't call her first,
she just got here first.

07:34.333 --> 07:36.667
Uh, if I were her,
I'd definitely be
the person

07:36.667 --> 07:38.125
I'd want someone
to call first.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.875
Actually, I called Marnie
before either of you.

07:39.875 --> 07:41.708
- Oh, well, that's nice.
- You're a twat.

07:41.708 --> 07:43.083
You know what,
if you see her,

07:43.083 --> 07:45.542
tell her her services
are no longer needed.

07:47.792 --> 07:50.041
- Hannah?
- Hannah: Who's there?

07:50.041 --> 07:52.458
What is going on?
Why aren't you in Idaho?

07:52.458 --> 07:54.333
What do you care?

07:54.333 --> 07:56.708
What did I do?

07:56.708 --> 08:00.875
I'm sorry, I'm just
really confused right now.

08:00.875 --> 08:03.417
Are you here on furlough?

08:03.417 --> 08:05.667
Adam is seeing someone.

08:05.667 --> 08:08.750
Yeah, right,
Mimi-Rose Howard.

08:08.750 --> 08:11.041
I told you
about her, right?

08:11.041 --> 08:12.333
No.

08:12.333 --> 08:14.917
Jessa, I think
I'd remember if you
told me that my boyfriend

08:14.917 --> 08:16.250
had an entirely
new girlfriend.

08:16.250 --> 08:19.041
- Fair enough.
- I don't understand
what's happening, Jess.

08:19.041 --> 08:22.125
I feel so fucking insane.
How did this even occur?

08:22.125 --> 08:26.583
Well, the heart wants
what the heart wants.

08:26.583 --> 08:29.291
You do know
who you're quoting, right?

08:29.291 --> 08:32.082
I actually am sure
I told you about her.

08:32.082 --> 08:33.417
I distinctly remember.

08:33.417 --> 08:37.917
Jessa, I'm 100% sure
you really didn't.

08:37.917 --> 08:41.707
Okay, so let's put
your mind at ease.

08:41.707 --> 08:42.707
What do you want
to know?

08:42.707 --> 08:45.583
Nothing, everything.
What do I need to know?

08:45.583 --> 08:49.708
( sighs )
Okay, I hadn't seen MRH
in, like, a year or two

08:49.708 --> 08:53.792
and I knew she was single
after the whole Ace thing
blew up

08:53.792 --> 08:56.166
and then I was
talking to Adam
about his predicament...

08:56.166 --> 08:59.125
Oh, my God.
You set them up?

08:59.125 --> 09:01.917
I mean, what's--
I don't understand.
What's the problem?

09:01.917 --> 09:04.458
You said you were
leaving for two years.

09:04.458 --> 09:07.291
Wh-- hold on, what were
we supposed to do,

09:07.291 --> 09:10.291
sit around
flicking our clits
till you got back?

09:10.291 --> 09:13.375
I can't fucking believe this.
I can't believe this.

09:13.375 --> 09:18.125
Oh, my God.
I mean, I don't
want to hurt you.

09:18.125 --> 09:21.875
But the fact is
is that Adam is happy.

09:21.875 --> 09:24.834
And he's really opening up
at our dumb meetings,

09:24.834 --> 09:26.834
which is a good thing.

09:27.959 --> 09:30.792
What is he saying
at the meetings?

09:30.792 --> 09:33.458
Hannah, you know
I can't tell you that.

09:33.458 --> 09:36.625
It's anonymous.
Don't be a child.

09:41.959 --> 09:44.000
Fuck!

09:44.000 --> 09:45.875
You just hit me.

09:45.875 --> 09:48.500
Yeah, you hit me.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.792
You're a fucking bitch.

09:50.792 --> 09:53.875
You have officially
gone psycho.

10:03.208 --> 10:06.083
She's basically reverted
to a preverbal level.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.333
- So?
- So, call Marnie.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.458
I've already called
her stupid phone
like 10 times.

10:10.458 --> 10:12.667
- How do you find people like--
- ( door slams )

10:18.208 --> 10:19.834
( car horn honking )

10:19.834 --> 10:23.250
Hannah: This is a message
for her majesty,
Marnie Michaels.

10:23.250 --> 10:25.125
This is Hannah,
and this is the last message

10:25.125 --> 10:27.708
you'll be receiving from me
during our friendship,

10:27.708 --> 10:29.542
which is now over
because of the fact

10:29.542 --> 10:32.333
that you haven't
been here for me during
what could constitute

10:32.333 --> 10:34.375
the worst moment
of my entire life.

10:34.375 --> 10:37.667
And I'm stuck
in our old apartment
in my bedroom.

10:37.667 --> 10:39.875
There's a hole in the wall
to your bedroom.

10:39.875 --> 10:43.125
The place is seething
with intruders.

10:43.125 --> 10:45.291
And I have never
had to piss worse in my life,

10:45.291 --> 10:49.542
and probably no one else
in America has ever had
to piss worse than me.

10:49.542 --> 10:50.834
( clicks )

11:12.417 --> 11:14.917
( urinating )

11:17.208 --> 11:20.375
- Caroline:
Really tickly!
- ( Laird laughs )

11:20.375 --> 11:22.542
- Caroline: Deeper, deeper.
- Laird: Harder?

11:22.542 --> 11:26.000
Oh, yeah.
Oh, sweet petunia,
don't be frightened.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.333
It's safe out here now.

11:27.333 --> 11:30.375
Where, uh--
where are Adam and... her?

11:30.375 --> 11:33.041
They're bunking down
at our place for the night.

11:33.041 --> 11:36.250
Come, step into
the light, my dear.

11:36.250 --> 11:39.291
How are your feelings?
Still pretty tender?

11:39.291 --> 11:40.583
I actually feel fine.

11:40.583 --> 11:43.708
It was a rough morning,
but now I could not feel
more fine.

11:43.708 --> 11:46.000
I'm actually worried
about how fine I feel.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.542
( chuckles )
Okay, I think this girl
needs a cup of tea, Laird.

11:50.542 --> 11:52.291
But I'm creaming
your feet.

11:52.291 --> 11:54.750
Why is everyone acting
like tea is some magic elixir

11:54.750 --> 11:57.500
that's gonna make it
so Adam doesn't have
a girlfriend anymore?

11:57.500 --> 11:59.667
Laird, tea.

11:59.667 --> 12:01.333
( sighs )
What kind of tea

12:01.333 --> 12:05.291
would you like me
to stop creaming the mother
of my unborn child's feet for

12:05.291 --> 12:07.125
and make for you, Hannah?

12:07.125 --> 12:09.375
( thumping )

12:09.375 --> 12:11.083
( whispers )
Who is that?

12:11.959 --> 12:13.083
That's not them.

12:13.083 --> 12:15.125
How do you know
it's not them, Laird?

12:15.125 --> 12:18.083
( thumping continues )

12:18.083 --> 12:20.542
Yep, that's Angelo
from 4G

12:20.542 --> 12:22.583
and his goddamn
noisy dress shoes

12:22.583 --> 12:23.750
like he's better
than everyone else.

12:23.750 --> 12:28.750
Caroline:
Mm, Miss Mimi-Rose.
Oh, Mimi-Rose.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.792
You know, I've only met her
two or three times,

12:30.792 --> 12:33.625
but I'm just not so sure
about her, Hannah.

12:33.625 --> 12:36.000
- Not so sure at all.
- Please go on.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.959
Well, Adam's very happy.
I mean, there's that.

12:38.959 --> 12:44.333
But, you know,
like everything else in life,
that could just be illusory.

12:44.333 --> 12:45.959
It's definitely illusory.

12:45.959 --> 12:49.125
Yeah, and you know Adam.
He has such a big heart.

12:49.125 --> 12:50.834
Oh, huge heart.

12:50.834 --> 12:54.208
But he's really at his best
when he's nurturing the poor,

12:54.208 --> 12:56.625
the lost,
the profoundly damaged.

12:56.625 --> 12:57.750
- Yes.
- You know?

12:57.750 --> 13:01.875
Which is why
you were so perfect
for him, you know?

13:01.875 --> 13:05.125
And I'm just--
I'm so sorry that
you are so sad.

13:05.125 --> 13:07.166
- Yeah.
- I'm really not sad.
I really feel--

13:07.166 --> 13:09.166
you know what,
I'm okay, Laird.

13:09.166 --> 13:10.500
I'm actually totally okay.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.208
Okay. Well, then,
this'll be for later

13:12.208 --> 13:13.708
when maybe you're
not feeling okay.

13:13.708 --> 13:15.708
Okay, but I'm gonna
feel okay later.

13:15.708 --> 13:18.000
And there is nothing sexual
about this at all

13:18.000 --> 13:20.375
because I am about
to become a father.

13:20.375 --> 13:21.583
That's right.

13:21.583 --> 13:24.125
But of course if you needed
something of that nature,

13:24.125 --> 13:25.834
we'd be happy to offer.

13:25.834 --> 13:26.959
Yeah.

13:26.959 --> 13:28.583
You're the best.

13:28.583 --> 13:30.500
- Baby, you're so sweet.
- Mm.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.708
No, you're sweet.

13:31.708 --> 13:34.208
- ( muffled ) No,
you're the greatest.
- No, no.

13:34.208 --> 13:35.458
I'm so lucky.

13:35.458 --> 13:37.417
I'm the luckiest.
Are you kidding?

13:37.417 --> 13:38.542
I couldn't be--

13:38.542 --> 13:41.750
( music blaring )

13:56.750 --> 13:58.750
( door opens )

13:58.750 --> 14:01.041
Hey.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.959
Hi, um...

14:02.959 --> 14:04.708
is Adam here, or...?

14:04.708 --> 14:06.792
Ray:
No, it's just us.

14:06.792 --> 14:08.375
Okay.

14:10.542 --> 14:13.375
Oh. Okay.

14:13.375 --> 14:15.166
Thank you, Ray.

14:15.166 --> 14:17.750
So I guess you know
what's going on.

14:17.750 --> 14:21.208
I do.
I do and I'm sorry.

14:21.208 --> 14:24.250
I'm sorry
and I'm sickened.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.458
I'm not fine, Ray.

14:26.458 --> 14:28.667
I'm not fine at all.
I can't even pretend.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.875
This whole thing
feels like a puzzle

14:30.875 --> 14:34.041
with no possible solution,
like a Rubik's Cube.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.583
Those actually
do have solutions.

14:36.583 --> 14:38.792
I mean, yeah, if you
take all the stickers off
and restick them.

14:38.792 --> 14:42.041
It's just-- you know,
I know we left things
open-ended,

14:42.041 --> 14:44.458
but we did not leave things
that open-ended.

14:44.458 --> 14:47.083
People can be
so fucked up,
Hannah, you know?

14:47.083 --> 14:49.125
They lie,
they obfuscate,

14:49.125 --> 14:50.417
and then if that
wasn't enough,

14:50.417 --> 14:52.125
on top of it all,
they think they can
get away with it

14:52.125 --> 14:53.250
because
everyone else does.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.708
- Yeah.
- Do you understand
how malignant

14:55.708 --> 14:58.417
and ethically bankrupt
that logic is?

14:58.417 --> 14:59.834
You deserve justice.

14:59.834 --> 15:03.041
I deserve justice,
and together, by God,
we will have justice.

15:03.041 --> 15:05.125
Come hell or high water,
we will have our justice.

15:05.125 --> 15:07.000
Can you flip
the bacon, please?

15:07.000 --> 15:08.750
Are you, um, okay, Ray?

15:08.750 --> 15:11.083
Do you maybe have some stuff
of your own going on?

15:11.083 --> 15:13.083
No, Hannah,
this is about you, okay?

15:13.083 --> 15:18.375
This is about you
and that protohominid
ex-boyfriend of yours.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.000
Okay, yeah, you know what?
Now that you say it,

15:20.000 --> 15:21.458
maybe it is
a little bit about me.

15:21.458 --> 15:23.166
Maybe it is.
Maybe it's about me

15:23.166 --> 15:25.166
and the self-appointed
mandarins and fellow travelers

15:25.166 --> 15:27.208
of Community Board Number Eight.
Quick question for you, Hannah.

15:27.208 --> 15:31.500
Let's say, hypothetically,
there was a very logical,
very expedient solution

15:31.500 --> 15:33.000
to a noise pollution
problem that threatened

15:33.000 --> 15:34.667
the mental health
of the entire community.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.166
Not one individual,
the entire community.

15:37.166 --> 15:39.333
And let's say
the solution to this problem
is so straightforward...

15:39.333 --> 15:43.041
- ( screaming )
- ...so basic, that a failure
to recognize it is--

15:43.041 --> 15:44.583
- Ray.
- What?

15:44.583 --> 15:46.667
- I burned myself.
- Well, put some ice on it,
but hear me out here.

15:46.667 --> 15:49.000
Now let's say
the solution to the problem
is so straightforward,

15:49.000 --> 15:51.625
- so practical,
that a failure to realize it--
- Hannah: Ray, look.

15:51.625 --> 15:54.500
I mean, what we're
essentially talking about--
oh, God.

15:54.500 --> 15:55.834
It's-- that's bad.

15:55.834 --> 15:57.834
We got to, uh--
we need--

15:57.834 --> 16:00.291
does Adam have
a first aid kit
in his workshop?

16:00.291 --> 16:04.333
Or is it all watch springs
and doll heads?

16:04.333 --> 16:07.375
I mean, they could
put a left-turn-only lane.
That would be something.

16:07.375 --> 16:10.333
They could also put just
a left-turn-only signal
on the traffic light.

16:10.333 --> 16:12.208
I mean, either of those
solutions would probably be--

16:12.208 --> 16:14.500
Have you talked
to Marnie lately?

16:14.500 --> 16:15.708
No.

16:15.708 --> 16:18.458
She's with that, uh,
Mumford or Son now, right?

16:18.458 --> 16:19.959
And, no, it doesn't
bother me.

16:19.959 --> 16:22.583
- It doesn't bother you?
- It doesn't bother me.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.166
Okay.

16:25.375 --> 16:26.625
I was her whore, Hannah.

16:26.625 --> 16:28.041
That's what I was.
I was her whore.

16:28.041 --> 16:30.917
- Uh-huh.
- I was her eff buddy, okay?

16:30.917 --> 16:34.125
I'm not the type of person
she's gonna, you know,
end up with.

16:34.125 --> 16:36.000
- I get that.
- Why would you say that?

16:36.000 --> 16:39.625
I'm not exactly
Patrick Dempsey
over here, you know?

16:39.625 --> 16:41.500
I get that,
but I reject the idea

16:41.500 --> 16:43.917
that I'm some sort
of hideous troll

16:43.917 --> 16:45.542
whose photo you wouldn't
want in your wedding album.

16:45.542 --> 16:47.917
- Here, let me see this.
- I don't think you're
a hideous troll.

16:47.917 --> 16:49.291
- Ow.
- No, I'm not.

16:49.291 --> 16:51.792
That's what I'm--
when you say that I'm not,

16:51.792 --> 16:54.750
it sounds like you think
that I am, though,
which is hurtful.

16:54.750 --> 16:57.083
I actually think
it was the age difference.

16:57.083 --> 16:59.333
The age difference?

16:59.333 --> 17:02.083
It wasn't a problem
for Shoshanna, right?

17:02.083 --> 17:04.208
- That's true.
- I'm 34.

17:04.208 --> 17:06.541
Someday,
you guys will be, too,
believe it or not.

17:06.541 --> 17:09.083
What can I say?
It's awful.

17:09.083 --> 17:11.250
All right, so keep that on.
Make sure this part is tight.

17:11.250 --> 17:13.125
- Okay.
- This is what we used
to do in the Boy Scouts

17:13.125 --> 17:15.416
during our wilderness
survival weekends.

17:15.416 --> 17:17.541
Keeps it dry.
Ahem.

17:20.375 --> 17:23.458
Hannah, I'm so sorry
for everything that
you're going through.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.959
- Thank you, Ray.
- I really am.

17:25.959 --> 17:29.083
And I want you
to remember one thing.

17:29.083 --> 17:32.291
You do not deserve this.

17:32.291 --> 17:34.250
Thank you, Ray.

17:34.250 --> 17:37.458
That means a lot to me.

17:37.458 --> 17:40.291
The minute I saw Peter,
I knew he would be mine,

17:40.291 --> 17:42.583
with his flaxen hair
and overalls.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.708
He was like
a Norman Rockwell painting.

17:44.708 --> 17:46.917
And one day on a ride
to an ice cream parlor,

17:46.917 --> 17:49.166
he finally asked me
to hold hands.

17:49.166 --> 17:51.291
( gasps )
I was in heaven.

17:51.291 --> 17:53.875
But that night,
as I tried to read a book,

17:53.875 --> 17:56.333
an activity
that had heretofore
been my favorite,

17:56.333 --> 17:58.208
I found myself
distracted.

17:58.208 --> 17:59.667
Good use of "heretofore."

17:59.667 --> 18:02.375
Mimi-Rose on laptop:
Where's Peter? What is
he thinking about?

18:02.375 --> 18:07.166
My private time,
my time to focus
and learn and grow

18:07.166 --> 18:10.583
was being sliced in half
by my new relationship.

18:10.583 --> 18:12.542
- So, yes, when I was nine...
- ( knock on door )

18:12.542 --> 18:15.834
Marnie:
Hannah, you can come out.
It's just me.

18:15.834 --> 18:18.500
And I brought food.

18:20.291 --> 18:23.625
Hello, Marnie.
Glad to see you're
a person who still exists.

18:23.625 --> 18:26.333
I am so sorry.
Sometimes when Desi
and I are woodshedding,

18:26.333 --> 18:27.834
we go on a cell phone diet.

18:27.834 --> 18:30.792
I'm really sorry.
How are you feeling?

18:30.792 --> 18:33.959
I'm great, okay?
I just need to take
a quick shower.

18:35.208 --> 18:36.333
( door closes )

18:44.959 --> 18:48.708
Mimi-Rose on phone:
So, yes, when I was nine,
I broke up with someone

18:48.708 --> 18:50.125
for hindering
my creativity.

18:50.125 --> 18:53.041
- ( audience laughs )
- And nothing's changed.

18:53.041 --> 18:55.750
Maybe I'm crazy,
but who knows?

18:55.750 --> 18:58.250
Think of all
your ups and downs,

18:58.250 --> 19:01.125
all your
hopes and fears.

19:01.125 --> 19:02.959
How many of them
have been yours

19:02.959 --> 19:06.917
and how many
have been constructs
of romantic discord?

19:09.125 --> 19:10.917
( knock on door )

19:10.917 --> 19:12.375
Hannah?

19:12.375 --> 19:14.166
I'm in the shower!

19:14.166 --> 19:18.542
This is not one of your
more convincing fake showers,
just so you know.

19:18.542 --> 19:20.291
This is not a fake shower!

19:20.291 --> 19:22.500
I'm in the middle
of showering.

19:24.041 --> 19:27.125
Look, I'm really sorry
you and I haven't had

19:27.125 --> 19:29.917
a chance to talk
about this one-on-one.

19:29.917 --> 19:31.083
I really am.

19:31.083 --> 19:33.208
Uh, yeah, that's 'cause
you completely disappeared.

19:33.208 --> 19:35.291
No, I've just--
I've been juggling a lot.

19:35.291 --> 19:37.375
Desi moved in,
which is exciting,

19:37.375 --> 19:39.375
and we've had
a lot of nibbles
from this label,

19:39.375 --> 19:41.875
but, honestly,
I think I've actually
just been avoiding you

19:41.875 --> 19:45.000
because I have no idea
how to say what I need
to say to you.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.917
Great, are you, uh,
breaking up with me, too?

19:47.917 --> 19:50.250
No, Hannah, I love you.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.041
I want you to be happy.

19:53.417 --> 19:56.583
Which is why I think
you need to let Adam go.

19:56.583 --> 19:58.417
No, I don't.

19:58.417 --> 20:00.750
Yeah, you do.

20:00.750 --> 20:02.208
You're the one who left.

20:02.208 --> 20:08.250
And I'm sure he should not
have moved on as quickly,
but he did,

20:08.250 --> 20:10.041
and he's just trying
to be happy.

20:10.041 --> 20:12.333
And if you don't
give him the space

20:12.333 --> 20:15.041
to at least see
where this goes,

20:15.041 --> 20:17.375
he's gonna
hate you forever

20:17.375 --> 20:19.875
and you'll hate
yourself.

20:19.875 --> 20:22.500
Just trust me.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.041
You have to let him go.

20:24.041 --> 20:27.667
Letting go doesn't come
very naturally to me.

20:27.667 --> 20:31.250
I know that,
and it's fucking hard,

20:31.250 --> 20:35.750
but did you really think
you and Adam were gonna
be a forever couple?

20:35.750 --> 20:38.625
I would've liked
the chance to find out.

20:38.625 --> 20:41.792
I think you have
found out.

20:41.792 --> 20:44.959
I think you have
your answer.

20:44.959 --> 20:46.542
( deep breath )

20:46.542 --> 20:50.000
So I guess we're not
like some great, artistic
love story.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.375
Maybe we are.

20:53.375 --> 20:55.375
You and me?

20:58.083 --> 21:00.375
Fine, I'll take it.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.333
Mimi-Rose?

21:11.708 --> 21:14.458
- ( door opens )
- Mi-- hey.

21:14.458 --> 21:17.834
Hey, I was just leaving.

21:17.834 --> 21:20.291
Oh, for good, or...

21:21.166 --> 21:23.166
Yeah, you can
take that, I guess.

21:23.166 --> 21:24.542
You want the other one?
It came with two.

21:24.542 --> 21:27.333
Um, I'll just
be needing the one.
It's my cast.

21:27.333 --> 21:30.083
Ray gave it to me
'cause I burned myself
pretty badly.

21:30.083 --> 21:31.417
Oh, fuck.

21:31.417 --> 21:34.542
You mind
if I check it out?

21:39.291 --> 21:41.333
( winces )

21:41.333 --> 21:43.500
Fuckin' Ray.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.708
Guy fancies himself
some kind of Renaissance man,

21:45.708 --> 21:47.375
but he doesn't know
jack shit about fuck.

21:47.375 --> 21:49.208
- It's really fine.
- No, that's bad.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.708
Go ahead and have a seat.
I'm gonna go grab my gear.

21:54.875 --> 21:56.083
Where's Mimi-Rose?

21:56.083 --> 21:58.542
I don't know.
Probably working late
at her studio.

21:58.542 --> 22:03.875
Wow, she has her own studio?
That's... really cool.

22:06.625 --> 22:09.458
Adam, I'm not proud
of my behavior yesterday.

22:09.458 --> 22:11.875
I would say it was not
my finest hour.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.875
I guess there was
just a part of me

22:15.875 --> 22:18.166
that thought that you would,
you know, wait for me

22:18.166 --> 22:21.000
or at least never meet anyone
who could possibly replace me.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.417
I know we didn't
make any promises,

22:22.417 --> 22:26.542
but that's just
what I thought.

22:26.542 --> 22:29.291
I mean, I had what
at the time seemed like

22:29.291 --> 22:30.834
a totally life-changing
opportunity,

22:30.834 --> 22:32.625
and so I had to follow it
through all the way.

22:32.625 --> 22:34.917
Yeah, so you left.

22:34.917 --> 22:37.917
- Yeah, but I'm here now.
- And I was sort of relieved.

22:40.917 --> 22:43.417
What?

22:43.417 --> 22:46.708
I mean, I didn't realize it
till after you were gone,
but, yeah.

22:48.625 --> 22:51.583
Why would you feel
that way?

22:53.291 --> 22:55.750
Did you think
it was working between us?

22:56.542 --> 22:58.417
I mean,
not all the time,

22:58.417 --> 23:02.500
but I really thought
the things that weren't
working, we could fix them.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.458
We tried this
all different kinds of ways.

23:04.458 --> 23:07.500
I don't know
any other ways.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.625
Do you?

23:11.291 --> 23:12.500
But it did work
for a while, right?

23:12.500 --> 23:16.125
Yeah, yeah, it worked like
a fuckin' charm, sometimes.

23:20.625 --> 23:23.834
What we had was... real,

23:23.834 --> 23:28.708
and it was beautiful
and intense and weird
and terrifying,

23:28.708 --> 23:32.125
and there was a time

23:32.125 --> 23:35.625
I couldn't imagine myself
with anyone else.

23:35.625 --> 23:37.667
Ever.

23:39.333 --> 23:43.333
( voice breaking )
But you don't feel
that way anymore.

23:43.333 --> 23:45.291
No.

23:48.166 --> 23:50.959
I'm so sorry.

23:50.959 --> 23:53.500
I know it seems fast
and really fuckin' weird,

23:53.500 --> 23:55.458
but it's what happened.

23:55.458 --> 23:57.875
( sniffles )

23:57.875 --> 24:01.333
I didn't plan on it,
but it's what happened.

24:01.333 --> 24:03.834
And I need to see
where it's gonna go.

24:08.208 --> 24:10.208
Do you love her?

24:18.166 --> 24:20.583
I don't know yet.

24:25.250 --> 24:27.000
Okay.

24:28.375 --> 24:29.792
I think it makes
the most sense

24:29.792 --> 24:31.458
for you to stay here,
so I'm gonna move out.

24:31.458 --> 24:33.708
Just give me
a couple days.

24:33.708 --> 24:35.792
Just change that
every 12 hours.

24:35.792 --> 24:37.834
You want me
to help you with this?

24:37.834 --> 24:40.000
I got it.
I got it, thanks.

24:44.417 --> 24:46.375
Okay.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.542
Thanks for
stopping by, kid.

24:58.875 --> 25:01.708
Thank you
for stopping by.

25:04.083 --> 25:07.208
But maybe don't
call me "kid" anymore.

25:07.208 --> 25:09.375
Okay, sure.

25:22.291 --> 25:26.250
