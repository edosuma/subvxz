01:32.270 --> 01:35.792
Some people believe that raven’s guide travelers to their destinations.

01:36.780 --> 01:41.020
Others believe that the sight of a solitary raven is considered good luck.

01:41.825 --> 01:44.932
While a group of ravens predicts trouble ahead.

01:45.777 --> 01:48.562
And a raven right before battle promises victory.

01:48.863 --> 01:52.150
Good evening ladies and gentlemen and welcome Tree Hill Raven’s basketball,

01:52.252 --> 01:54.656
brought to you by web cast at Ravenshoops.com.

01:54.880 --> 01:59.166
I’m Mouth McFadden and the playoffs are finally here, so throw out the perfect record,

01:59.396 --> 02:01.818
if the raven’s lose this one, the season is over.

02:02.724 --> 02:07.189
Tonight’s obstacle is Masonboro. If you win, you’re one step closer to a state championship,

02:07.445 --> 02:10.112
and undefeated season and greatness.

02:10.889 --> 02:14.044
Lose, and be losers.

02:31.386 --> 02:34.263
You know, all this working out doesn’t mean anything if you can’t hit the shot.

02:34.806 --> 02:35.933
What’s wrong with you?

02:36.041 --> 02:39.136
I’m just saying, it’s a waste of my time to get you ready for this game

02:39.212 --> 02:40.392
if you can’t score when we need it.

02:41.083 --> 02:42.799
Huh. Give me the ball.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.517
Now, you going to tell me what’s really wrong?

02:51.635 --> 02:52.415
I guess...

02:54.794 --> 02:56.331
I guess I’m just dealing with Haley.

02:57.269 --> 02:58.635
She’s still not talking to you, huh?

02:59.034 --> 02:59.711
No.

03:06.455 --> 03:08.389
Don’t think I haven’t noticed your part in all this.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.324
You know, Haley, if you’re going to manipulate him, you should aim a little higher.

03:15.665 --> 03:17.289
And remember, pay back is hell.

03:22.527 --> 03:25.572
Oh...by the way, nice tattoo.

03:26.223 --> 03:27.027
Real classy.

03:29.100 --> 03:31.609
Just moments away from the beginning of this playoff game.

03:31.747 --> 03:34.813
Winners advance. To the losers, well, their season is over.

03:35.315 --> 03:38.619
Dan Scott is standing in for coach Whitey Durham who is out with an illness.

03:38.934 --> 03:42.811
Not sure who signed off on that one, but let’s hope Coach Durham gets well soon.

03:54.218 --> 03:58.023
Really, Deb, tears. On the eve of our divorce.

03:58.433 --> 04:02.047
No, actually, I was sitting here having second thoughts.

04:03.547 --> 04:07.754
Until I considered what a hideous monster you’ve been for most of our married lives.

04:12.671 --> 04:16.173
Well since we’re frolicking down memory lane, let’s take a stroll back to the campus

04:16.230 --> 04:17.689
the night you told me you were pregnant.

04:19.988 --> 04:22.389
You know I came to you that night to tell you I had made a decision.

04:23.117 --> 04:25.359
I was leaving school at the end of the semester.

04:25.476 --> 04:27.388
Because of your fictional knee injury.

04:27.642 --> 04:30.499
No. No, Deb, that’s just what I told you.

04:31.652 --> 04:34.488
I was leaving because there was a girl I left behind.

04:35.020 --> 04:36.817
A girl who was carrying my child.

04:37.375 --> 04:39.316
And a girl that I loved very much.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.285
Karen.

04:47.119 --> 04:50.083
But when I told you I was leaving you told me you were pregnant.

04:50.964 --> 04:53.221
I didn’t know you were leaving for Karen.

04:53.601 --> 04:56.867
I know. All you knew is that I would do right by you and Nathan.

04:57.667 --> 04:59.877
Which is something I’ve tried to do every day since then.

05:03.491 --> 05:04.982
And if that makes me a monster,

05:06.418 --> 05:07.532
then so be it.

05:11.285 --> 05:12.162
You alright?

05:12.888 --> 05:13.717
Have you seen Haley?

05:14.150 --> 05:14.736
No.

05:22.027 --> 05:24.469
Nathan, you’re soaked. What are you doing?

05:25.273 --> 05:27.353
I just went for a run to clear my head,

05:28.181 --> 05:29.733
I guess this is where I ended up.

05:31.750 --> 05:35.064
Look, Haley, the picture of Peyton didn’t mean anything, okay?

05:35.466 --> 05:38.626
It did to me. Clearly you still have feelings for her.

05:39.604 --> 05:41.776
I saved that picture back when we were still dating.

05:42.494 --> 05:44.669
The other ones too, you can go back and look.

05:45.041 --> 05:47.397
Her web cam hasn’t even been in her closet for months.

05:48.467 --> 05:50.193
Why didn’t you tell me that last week?

05:50.367 --> 05:53.848
Because, I should have deleted those images a long time ago.

05:54.298 --> 05:57.023
I just felt bad because I didn’t do it.

05:59.050 --> 06:03.653
Besides, Haley, I don’t want Peyton. I want you.

06:04.477 --> 06:05.615
Is that it?

06:07.258 --> 06:11.139
You know, my pride says yeah, that’s it. Just walk away

06:11.191 --> 06:15.399
and let Haley deal with the fact that she’s clearly threatened by a sexual relationship.

06:16.349 --> 06:20.867
But my heart says, just forget about your pride you idiot.

06:21.984 --> 06:23.068
You love this girl.

06:25.163 --> 06:28.894
And even if you’re going to catch pneumonia, your ass is going to stand out here in the rain

06:30.692 --> 06:33.420
till you convince her to forgive you.

06:37.646 --> 06:41.292
So come on, Hales, just meet me half way here?

06:42.786 --> 06:43.722
Why should I?

06:44.660 --> 06:45.924
Because I’m sorry.

06:47.927 --> 06:48.951
Because I love you.

06:51.306 --> 06:53.947
And Because you’re looking really hot standing out here in the rain,

06:54.065 --> 06:56.010
and I’m thinking, I have to kiss you.

06:59.635 --> 07:00.896
Well, if you have to.

07:16.962 --> 07:17.680
Hey.

07:18.098 --> 07:18.584
Hey.

07:18.954 --> 07:23.859
This is your night, this is your gym. Take no prisoners. Hands in.

07:24.901 --> 07:26.270
Let’s win this one for Whitey.

07:26.797 --> 07:29.750
Hey, forget the old man, you win it for yourselves.

07:29.829 --> 07:33.454
Come on boys! When are we going to lose? 1...2...3...Nevermore!

07:34.938 --> 07:37.708
Hey, there’s no name on your jersey.

07:38.528 --> 07:39.619
Yeah there is.

07:40.576 --> 07:41.451
Right there.

07:41.975 --> 07:44.462
So Ravens take the floor and we’re all set to go.

07:55.373 --> 07:58.415
Listen... I talked to my mom.

07:59.280 --> 08:04.241
And I guess I’m sorry for resenting you for not wanting to be in my life.

08:05.741 --> 08:07.575
I didn’t know you wanted custody.

08:10.728 --> 08:13.957
I also never said thank you for rescuing me from the accident.

08:14.416 --> 08:18.521
You should be on the floor by now for practice. Go run 21 sprints.

08:32.644 --> 08:34.070
You better watch that bad shoulder.

08:35.477 --> 08:37.054
You better watch the score board.

08:37.751 --> 08:40.751
Here we go, ravens fans, the playoffs are underway.

08:41.053 --> 08:45.780
Ravens control the tip, Nathan Scott brings it up court to the pride of his hometown crowd.

08:45.872 --> 08:48.617
I’ll tell you, there’s a lot of love in the air tonight.

08:54.110 --> 08:56.322
That seat’s reserved for my friend Peyton.

08:56.914 --> 08:58.037
You’re friend, huh?

09:00.346 --> 09:01.667
As far as she knows.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.384
So where is Jake, Brooke?

09:06.726 --> 09:08.748
Buy me a drink and maybe I’ll tell you.

09:20.760 --> 09:24.052
Early in the second quarter, this Masonboro team,  big underdogs,

09:24.139 --> 09:26.043
are giving the ravens all they can handle.

09:26.521 --> 09:29.613
- All night, baby, all night.
- Shut up, you little punk.

09:30.709 --> 09:34.789
It could be the time away, or maybe Dan Scott’s influence, but whatever the reason,

09:34.881 --> 09:38.628
the players have dug themselves a whole and they’re looking at a long road back.

09:43.995 --> 09:45.178
Did you even love me, Karen?

09:45.859 --> 09:47.344
Keith, I do love you.

09:48.197 --> 09:49.376
Not like that.

09:54.845 --> 09:56.114
I don’t know how to answer that.

09:56.723 --> 09:58.986
You don’t know how to, or you don’t want to?

10:01.218 --> 10:03.297
Keith, I don’t want you to leave like this.

10:05.171 --> 10:06.467
It’s a little late for that.

10:08.009 --> 10:12.899
But at least let’s tell the truth. Okay?

10:14.184 --> 10:17.671
I’m not leaving for a job or some fresh perspective

10:17.726 --> 10:19.642
or because I wanted to get out of this town.

10:21.284 --> 10:24.576
I’m leaving because I can’t look at you anymore without my heart breaking.

10:27.665 --> 10:30.527
How many serious relationships have you had since Dan?

10:30.941 --> 10:33.301
I’ll tell you. None.

10:34.208 --> 10:35.581
Why are you doing this?

10:38.191 --> 10:43.470
Karen, it was a dark day when you said no to my proposal.

10:43.690 --> 10:47.561
But, you know, I can live with that. I don’t need you to love me.

10:49.541 --> 10:51.917
But you got to open up your heart to somebody.

10:53.281 --> 10:57.678
You got to let someone discover how staggering you are.

11:00.211 --> 11:02.885
Just don’t be alone, that I can’t live with.

11:07.073 --> 11:09.383
The ravens grab the rebound and push it up court.

11:09.593 --> 11:13.515
Tim Smith passes to Lucas Scott, over to Nathan Scott for the slam!

11:13.765 --> 11:15.835
I see the Ravens are finally working together.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.009
Go ravens!

11:19.403 --> 11:20.790
You know you can trust me.

11:22.813 --> 11:27.245
Brooke, it’s really important to me that Nikki never finds out where Jake took Jenny.

11:27.313 --> 11:29.110
I know it’s important to you, Peyton.

11:30.155 --> 11:32.283
That’s why you can trust me with this.

11:33.877 --> 11:35.192
But she still hasn’t told you?

11:35.582 --> 11:38.634
No, but she will. She thinks we’re tight again.

11:39.560 --> 11:44.348
Not that I care, but, you must really hate Peyton to betray her trust like this.

11:44.645 --> 11:46.769
Yeah, well, she’s got it coming.

11:47.028 --> 11:51.418
If Jake and Jenny meant anything to her, she’ll know what it feels like to have her heart crushed, won’t she?

11:53.210 --> 11:54.239
Fine by me.

11:59.873 --> 12:02.513
Coming up on half time and Ravens continue the lead.

12:03.225 --> 12:05.513
Lucas Scott with the ball that leads to Nathan.

12:05.872 --> 12:08.697
Caw! The birds have taken flight.

12:09.134 --> 12:12.938
They look a lot sharper now, but something tells me Masonboro isn’t going away.

12:15.287 --> 12:16.885
You okay, mom?

12:19.702 --> 12:24.683
I am having a problem letting you go. You’re just a kid, Luke.

12:25.902 --> 12:29.635
Part of me says that you are too young for this, I know I’m too young for it.

12:31.713 --> 12:35.472
You know this isn’t about me wanting to leave you, right? Because it’s not.

12:35.518 --> 12:40.305
Then what is it about? Explain it to me again, why you want to leave.

12:41.247 --> 12:43.253
Do you remember when I first joined the team?

12:44.319 --> 12:46.782
You know, the boosters treated you poorly.

12:47.463 --> 12:49.900
You wanted them to see who you’d become.

12:50.924 --> 12:53.826
And they could only see who you used to be.

12:54.611 --> 12:57.591
Or at least who they thought you were.

13:00.140 --> 13:01.881
I need a chance to start over.

13:03.797 --> 13:05.624
And I don’t want Keith to be alone either.

13:06.294 --> 13:07.498
At least for a little while.

13:11.564 --> 13:13.703
I told him he could join you in Charleston.

13:18.120 --> 13:21.655
I want you to know, I’ll protect him with my life this time.

13:22.726 --> 13:23.759
I know you will.

13:25.899 --> 13:27.369
Other wise I wouldn’t allow it.

13:31.267 --> 13:34.655
No one’s ever asked me if I would ever trust you again.

13:36.625 --> 13:39.870
And you need to know that if this was anybody else I wouldn’t let him go.

13:43.619 --> 13:45.238
That means a lot to me.

13:49.707 --> 13:51.459
I guess I should go then.

14:03.046 --> 14:04.407
I’m sorry, Keith.

14:16.211 --> 14:17.182
Me too.

14:20.469 --> 14:21.964
- Want a towel?
- Yes.

14:26.009 --> 14:27.689
- Well that was a nice walk.
- Yeah.

14:36.080 --> 14:36.658
What?

14:46.778 --> 14:47.565
Haley.

14:48.676 --> 14:49.603
No, it’s okay.

14:50.908 --> 14:51.881
It’s okay.

15:03.849 --> 15:06.744
The ravens lead a close one by two as we come up on half time.

15:07.391 --> 15:10.020
Daniel Lawrence gives it to Tim who dribbles out top.

15:10.569 --> 15:16.194
Luke breaks free on the wing, puts up a three pointer, release rotation, splash, ravens lead it by five.

15:17.528 --> 15:21.500
Time for score at half time, ravens 34 and bears 39.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.230
This is web cast at ravenshoops.com.

15:26.733 --> 15:30.645
Wow. Masonboro just hit Lucas Scott with a cheap shot.

15:30.711 --> 15:32.485
Nathan comes to his defense and things are getting ugly

15:32.561 --> 15:35.437
as the refs hurry back to the floor to try and break up a brawl.

15:36.077 --> 15:39.230
Lucas Scott is still down protecting his bad shoulder.

15:48.006 --> 15:49.763
So Jake went to Savannah?

15:50.818 --> 15:52.455
He’s got family there.

15:53.142 --> 15:56.951
I don’t know if we would have been anything, you know, but I really loved Jenny.

15:57.366 --> 15:59.403
And I worry about them.

16:00.563 --> 16:02.015
I’m glad you told me, Peyton.

16:03.480 --> 16:04.913
You know I’m here for you.

16:06.198 --> 16:07.463
I know you are.

16:08.359 --> 16:09.577
What if we’re not good together?

16:10.284 --> 16:12.818
- What if it drives us apart?
- It won’t.

16:15.204 --> 16:17.965
Look, Haley, I want to be with you.

16:19.976 --> 16:22.648
And if you don’t want to be with me, I guess I understand,

16:23.716 --> 16:26.095
but, this isn’t going to change anything.

16:28.731 --> 16:29.908
Tonight then.

16:31.059 --> 16:32.254
After the game.

16:34.932 --> 16:37.062
Already making plans for after the game, boys?

16:37.426 --> 16:38.914
Because this is a joke!

16:39.499 --> 16:41.879
You guys are up five points, you should be up fifty points.

16:41.978 --> 16:45.924
Oh and while you have your heads up your asses, why don’t you take a whiff of how you’ve been playing.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.300
Tim, turnovers. Nathan, focus.

16:50.527 --> 16:51.781
Hey, come here.

16:54.211 --> 16:55.038
How are we doing?

16:55.213 --> 16:57.763
Coach, we should get him x-rayed. I think he’s done for the night.

16:57.837 --> 16:59.723
Whoa, whoa. Are you sure?

16:59.805 --> 17:01.535
Well I can’t be sure without the x-ray.

17:01.699 --> 17:04.890
But if he were my kid, I wouldn’t risk it. And considering the rehab-

17:07.146 --> 17:09.323
Hey. How you doing?

17:09.830 --> 17:13.189
It just feels a little weird. What’d the doc say?

17:13.251 --> 17:16.313
He said you’d be fine. But if you want to sit out, I can’t make you play.

17:17.019 --> 17:18.601
But your teammates are counting on you.

17:19.343 --> 17:20.407
I’ll be fine.

17:22.169 --> 17:22.983
Good man.

17:25.304 --> 17:26.942
Kid says he wants to play, doc.

17:27.023 --> 17:29.706
But I’ll tell you what, as soon as the game’s over, we’ll get him an x-ray, okay?

17:38.993 --> 17:39.896
You good, man?

17:41.766 --> 17:46.327
Good. Cause all this means nothing if you can’t knock down that shot.

17:49.862 --> 17:51.918
Do you know about my dad’s state championship game?

17:53.173 --> 17:55.224
Yeah, Whitey benched Dan.

17:55.716 --> 17:58.133
Not exactly. That’s Whitey’s story.

17:59.045 --> 18:01.815
See, they were leading, and Whitey wanted to go into a stall.

18:02.215 --> 18:08.246
My dad didn’t want to, so at the end of the game, with everything on the line, he sat down.

18:08.517 --> 18:09.798
Refused to go back into the game.

18:10.663 --> 18:11.277
Really?

18:11.497 --> 18:16.213
Yeah. The way my dad sees it, he lost the game, but won the argument.

18:18.726 --> 18:20.221
I couldn’t do that to my teammates.

18:20.380 --> 18:21.542
Yeah, me neither.

18:22.326 --> 18:24.875
Although if we lose this game, I’m going back to hating you.

18:26.619 --> 18:30.020
Well, it’s the Scott boys. Together.

18:30.427 --> 18:33.048
My eyes really must be screwed up.

18:33.493 --> 18:34.261
Hey, coach.

18:34.824 --> 18:36.667
We wanted to catch you before you went to the hospital.

18:37.055 --> 18:38.183
Glad you did.

18:39.238 --> 18:41.311
How’s practice going with Danny?

18:42.425 --> 18:44.935
The same as with you. It sucks.

18:47.927 --> 18:52.914
Well, coach, the players, we all signed this ball for you.

18:53.241 --> 18:54.414
Sort of a get well card.

18:56.918 --> 19:00.777
You know, I’ve been around this game practically my whole life.

19:02.421 --> 19:06.543
And there’s never been a day that I was as gifted as either one of you.

19:07.443 --> 19:08.483
Remember that.

19:10.761 --> 19:13.009
Don’t let Danny take that from you.

19:14.693 --> 19:16.767
You boys play with your whole hearts.

19:18.585 --> 19:22.799
You take your shots, no regrets.

19:30.423 --> 19:32.762
Reverse lay up by the ravens for another two.

19:33.264 --> 19:36.705
Nathan and Lucas Scott have taken over, keeping the ravens in close,

19:36.761 --> 19:42.019
but it may be too little too late as Masonboro leads it by five, time running out in the forth.

19:42.204 --> 19:43.841
Oh man, I’m scared.

19:47.857 --> 19:48.768
Lucas!

19:51.359 --> 19:52.843
Luke, I’m scared.

19:58.787 --> 20:01.065
Luke, this is so not cool.

20:01.393 --> 20:03.519
Come out here right now, Lucas Scott.

20:06.285 --> 20:09.381
Damn it, Haley. You’re going to kill me.

20:10.052 --> 20:11.531
You know Houdini died like that.

20:11.728 --> 20:13.266
You deserve it, dumb ass.

20:13.897 --> 20:16.299
I told you, I didn’t want to take this shortcut.

20:17.363 --> 20:18.500
What are you whispering for?

20:19.052 --> 20:19.873
Because.

20:20.491 --> 20:23.133
Haley, these people, they’re dead.

20:23.221 --> 20:26.953
I know, but if you keep yelling, the stinking zombies are going to hear us.

20:29.467 --> 20:30.175
Haley.

20:32.135 --> 20:33.976
- What?
- Look, I’ve got to tell you something.

20:35.038 --> 20:37.613
What is her name and what did you do that you regret?

20:39.768 --> 20:41.300
I’m going to Charleston with Keith.

20:41.760 --> 20:42.826
Alright, for how long?

20:44.274 --> 20:46.803
For good. I’m moving there.

20:47.571 --> 20:48.872
What are you talking about?

20:49.231 --> 20:50.725
Keith got a job in Charleston.

20:51.628 --> 20:55.078
And I’m going to go live with him there, after the season’s over.

20:56.383 --> 20:58.641
Haley, I need to go.

21:00.159 --> 21:02.276
- Come no, don’t do that.
- Don’t do what?!

21:02.675 --> 21:05.486
You can not bring me out in the middle of a creepy cemetery

21:05.537 --> 21:08.482
and tell me that you are leaving Tree Hill for good, that is not fair!

21:08.553 --> 21:11.809
Haley, come on, it’s not that far. I’ll still see you.

21:11.927 --> 21:15.527
Not like now. Who’s going to go thrift store hunting with me, Lucas?

21:15.583 --> 21:19.602
Who’s going to buy bad music or lie to the campus lost and found and claim dumb stuff?

21:19.670 --> 21:20.800
Who’s going to do that with me?

21:21.943 --> 21:22.644
Nathan.

21:24.211 --> 21:25.182
And me, too.

21:25.732 --> 21:26.648
Once and a while.

21:27.503 --> 21:30.119
Look, I’ve thought a lot about this, Haley. Okay?

21:30.186 --> 21:35.341
And I feel like I can be a better person if I go now.

21:37.825 --> 21:39.882
I am sure going to miss you.

21:41.743 --> 21:43.340
You’re my best friend, Hales.

21:44.193 --> 21:45.350
You always will be.

21:48.752 --> 21:49.733
Idiot.

21:51.889 --> 21:52.571
Come here.

21:57.796 --> 21:58.618
You okay?

21:59.150 --> 22:00.799
No, I’m scared again.

22:03.634 --> 22:08.166
No going back now, folks. This is it. Down by two, less than a minute on the clock.

22:08.243 --> 22:09.743
The ravens need a stop.

22:10.239 --> 22:11.634
You got anything left in that shoulder?

22:12.804 --> 22:13.686
A little bit.

22:14.263 --> 22:16.563
Come on, man. Let’s take this thing.

22:17.710 --> 22:21.377
Masonboro inbound, full court pressure by the ravens with under 20 seconds.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.880
- No fouls!
- Dan Scott calls for no fouls.

22:24.034 --> 22:26.736
Time is running out and he wants the birds to make a play.

22:27.292 --> 22:32.491
At half court, Lucas Scott pokes the ball free. Nathan Scott grabs it and time out.

22:32.558 --> 22:37.519
A sensational steel. The Ravens have it, down by two, 12 seconds left in the game.

22:37.729 --> 22:41.190
Okay, bring it in. Bring it in.

22:42.529 --> 22:46.504
Look at me, look at me. Who out there is scared? Who’s scared?

22:46.904 --> 22:49.782
Cause if you’re scared you sit your ass on this bench I don’t want you on that court.

22:49.905 --> 22:52.772
Nathan, look at me. Get the ball in your hands, okay?

22:52.854 --> 22:56.505
Hold the ball tough till there’s five seconds left on the clock then you bang inside and tie this thing up.

22:56.566 --> 22:59.151
- But they’re going to double him.
- I don’t care if they put five guys on him, Tim!

22:59.212 --> 23:02.116
Listen to me, five seconds, okay? Then you shove it down their throats.

23:02.192 --> 23:04.441
Great players make great plays, Nathan. Hands in.

23:04.538 --> 23:07.753
Let’s go. Win it on 3. 1...2...3.. Win it!

23:12.204 --> 23:15.532
Hey, it means nothing if you can’t knock down the shot.

23:16.212 --> 23:19.407
So the Ravens break the huddle. 12 seconds left on the clock.

23:19.523 --> 23:23.144
They need a basket to tie, a three pointer to win, or their season is over.

23:23.390 --> 23:27.461
The standing room crowd is on their feet. Lucas Scott will throw it in.

23:27.640 --> 23:31.281
He does safety. Finds Tim Smith who immediately swings it to Nathan Scott.

23:32.560 --> 23:36.119
We’re at eight seconds. Now seven. Nathan works out top.

23:36.200 --> 23:39.739
Five seconds on the clock. Now four. He spins to the basket.

23:39.881 --> 23:42.881
Then passes to Luke for a three pointer and the win!

24:26.777 --> 24:28.210
Nice work, ladies.

24:28.680 --> 24:32.527
Undefeated regular season, conference champs and all for nothing.

24:34.231 --> 24:37.033
Look at me, Nathan. Cause I want to see your face when you explain to me

24:37.074 --> 24:39.003
why you didn’t run the play I told you to.

24:39.223 --> 24:42.413
Take off that jersey, you don’t deserve to wear it. None of you do!

24:47.675 --> 24:51.229
Do you have an answer for me yet? Because I can wait, I have no where else to be.

24:51.475 --> 24:55.561
And you don’t either, you want to know why? Because your season is over!

24:56.104 --> 24:58.700
Why did you disobey me and pass to Lucas when you knew...

24:58.761 --> 25:00.030
When I knew what, dad?

25:00.410 --> 25:02.862
That Lucas shouldn’t have been in that game because of his injury?

25:03.308 --> 25:04.936
Because we both knew that, didn’t we?

25:05.003 --> 25:05.745
Watch it.

25:06.523 --> 25:08.002
I should have hit the shot.

25:09.349 --> 25:11.940
- It’s my fault.
- You’re damn right it’s your fault.

25:12.488 --> 25:13.927
You let your teammates down.

25:14.054 --> 25:16.214
Teammates you shouldn’t have had in the first place, by the way.

25:16.339 --> 25:18.867
At least he took a shot. Unlike you.

25:18.954 --> 25:21.100
- What did you say to me?
- You heard what I said.

25:21.171 --> 25:24.316
I said at least he took a shot. That’s more than you did, right dad?

25:24.377 --> 25:25.759
I wouldn’t go there if I were you, Nathan.

25:25.830 --> 25:30.070
Why not? You’re talking about letting down our teammates. Lucas was there all game.

25:30.132 --> 25:32.324
He played in pain with an injury you knew about.

25:32.947 --> 25:34.923
But he wasn’t a coward like you were.

25:35.154 --> 25:38.944
Tim, go get security. Tell them my son has been beaten to death.

25:39.306 --> 25:44.217
We played hard. And we lost. We have nothing to be ashamed of.

25:47.631 --> 25:49.163
Except maybe our coach.

25:56.695 --> 25:57.893
No regrets.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.347
It was a tough loss.

26:25.977 --> 26:27.925
Well if it isn’t the Fredo of the family.

26:28.739 --> 26:30.323
How’s that employment line, boozie?

26:33.656 --> 26:37.549
I just came by to let you know that I’m leaving.

26:39.650 --> 26:40.386
Really?

26:43.966 --> 26:45.103
So what’d you do with the ring?

26:46.761 --> 26:48.696
I mean if you’re finally leaving town after all these years

26:48.758 --> 26:51.032
that means you proposed to Karen, and she said no.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.223
So what’d you do with the ring?

26:54.201 --> 26:55.302
I’m driving it.

26:56.070 --> 26:57.446
‘89 Land Cruiser.

26:59.731 --> 27:01.091
I could have given you a better deal.

27:05.008 --> 27:06.950
Well, I’ll consider that your goodbye.

27:09.441 --> 27:10.265
Keith.

27:14.123 --> 27:14.599
Yeah?

27:18.450 --> 27:19.099
Never mind.

27:32.805 --> 27:34.649
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:34.711 --> 27:36.799
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

27:40.680 --> 27:42.438
I’m leaving tomorrow, Haley.

27:43.805 --> 27:44.910
Already?

27:46.190 --> 27:46.737
Yeah.

27:49.846 --> 27:50.654
Okay.

27:51.333 --> 27:53.000
Hey. It’s okay.

27:53.903 --> 28:00.833
No it’s not, I really wanted to spend your last night with you, but Nathan’s waiting.

28:00.937 --> 28:02.334
Hey, go.

28:03.694 --> 28:05.836
I’ve got to get my shoulder checked out anyway.

28:07.509 --> 28:10.459
I’ll find you before I leave tomorrow, okay?

28:13.985 --> 28:15.779
I’m really going to miss you, Luke.

28:18.119 --> 28:19.260
I’ll miss you, too.

28:21.671 --> 28:22.644
Okay, bye.

28:39.613 --> 28:40.953
- Hey.
- Sorry about the game.

28:41.287 --> 28:41.860
Yeah.

28:45.006 --> 28:46.954
Hales, don’t cry.

28:50.810 --> 28:54.749
- Haley, we don’t have to do this tonight.
- No, no I want to.

28:55.603 --> 28:56.427
More than ever.

28:58.747 --> 28:59.693
You sure?

29:03.580 --> 29:04.312
Yeah.

29:05.736 --> 29:06.810
No regrets.

29:22.641 --> 29:23.466
Hey.

29:24.128 --> 29:24.842
Hey.

29:25.637 --> 29:28.447
I told you I’d help you burn Dan’s stuff if you wanted.

29:31.172 --> 29:34.347
Normally I sit with Whitey after every home game, win or lose,

29:34.637 --> 29:38.044
so I hope you don’t mind.

29:41.167 --> 29:42.160
You leaving tomorrow?

29:42.500 --> 29:43.219
Yeah.

29:44.602 --> 29:47.388
Yeah. With Lucas.

29:51.504 --> 29:56.568
You know, the first time I left Dan, I still believed that I could get out.

29:57.080 --> 30:02.587
I’d just pack my things and escape to a new life. But you can’t.

30:03.740 --> 30:06.171
You just put a new face on the same loneliness.

30:07.437 --> 30:11.134
What happened to us, Keith? How did we become so broken?

30:12.869 --> 30:14.038
We fell in love.

30:15.870 --> 30:19.064
And at some point, the people that we loved forgot to love us back.

30:33.078 --> 30:36.596
Well I’m sorry your season’s over, Lucas, but even if the team would have won,

30:36.657 --> 30:39.376
your season is over anyway. No basketball.

30:46.933 --> 30:48.136
Maybe you shouldn’t go.

30:49.340 --> 30:51.336
I mean with your shoulder and everything.

30:51.987 --> 30:54.624
Mom, it’s time.

30:58.465 --> 31:00.189
I’m going to go see Whitey, okay?

31:11.760 --> 31:12.749
Hey, coach.

31:14.002 --> 31:16.742
Don’t tell me. You lost at the buzzer.

31:17.647 --> 31:22.518
They doubled Nathan and you missed a wide open look.

31:25.101 --> 31:26.771
Web cast.

31:27.264 --> 31:29.342
Ravenshoops.com.

31:31.623 --> 31:34.570
Well it was a good look. Let it go.

31:38.570 --> 31:45.040
Doc says this eye thing might be a little more complicated than they thought it was.

31:46.858 --> 31:49.710
Coach, you’re going to be okay, right?

31:52.085 --> 31:52.931
We’ll see.

31:55.060 --> 31:58.890
Look, I just wanted you to know,

32:00.284 --> 32:02.679
that I really appreciate everything you’ve done for me.

32:04.252 --> 32:05.396
You believed in me.

32:06.916 --> 32:08.977
And for that I will always owe you.

32:11.135 --> 32:12.489
You want to do me a favor?

32:13.595 --> 32:14.092
Sure.

32:14.770 --> 32:16.211
Take care of Keith.

32:17.487 --> 32:18.915
He’s a good man.

32:20.318 --> 32:21.465
So are you, coach.

33:13.180 --> 33:13.930
Damn it.

33:21.334 --> 33:27.257
Question. Who is sexy, talented, and knows where Jake is?

33:27.876 --> 33:28.901
Oh I know, it’s me.

33:30.139 --> 33:31.096
So where is he?

33:32.023 --> 33:34.082
Tell you what. I’ll play you for it.

33:34.195 --> 33:36.458
You beat me, I’ll tell you where he went.

33:37.179 --> 33:40.282
I don’t want to play games, Brooke. Just tell me where Jake took Jenny.

33:55.622 --> 33:56.949
So that’s it, huh?

33:58.359 --> 34:01.081
Betrayal of Peyton complete. How does it feel?

34:01.382 --> 34:04.311
It feels like you should be gone by now because you got your information.

34:05.392 --> 34:09.824
You know, Brooke, you should really try to be a better person. No body likes a bitch.

34:24.638 --> 34:26.476
Was that Nikki you were talking to?

34:27.268 --> 34:30.433
Yeah. I told her where Jake went.

34:33.368 --> 34:35.953
And she bought it, just like we planned.

34:36.721 --> 34:38.995
It’s going to be a long road trip to Seattle.

34:41.609 --> 34:43.618
I told you, Peyton, I’m here for you.

34:44.232 --> 34:44.969
I know you are.

34:56.994 --> 34:58.900
Look, it’s not what it looks like.

34:59.207 --> 35:01.819
No? Because it looked like you were having sex with my wife.

35:02.102 --> 35:06.556
Unless of course you both tripped and fell. Your clothes fell off and somehow you ended up on top of her.

35:06.597 --> 35:11.209
What I mean is, this hasn’t been going on, okay? It just happened.

35:11.261 --> 35:13.038
You listen to me, you son of a bitch.

35:13.146 --> 35:15.091
Those are the last words you’re ever going to speak to me.

35:15.194 --> 35:17.378
You are no longer my brother. You understand that?

35:18.633 --> 35:20.261
You do not exist to me.

35:37.514 --> 35:41.541
I told you if you missed that shot it was all for nothing. I was wrong.

35:43.591 --> 35:45.448
I figured I’d find you out here.

35:46.786 --> 35:48.161
Word is you’re leaving town.

35:48.729 --> 35:52.231
Yeah. I’m just meeting the guys to say goodbye.

35:53.897 --> 35:55.370
You leaving because of the game?

35:55.990 --> 35:56.763
Nah.

35:59.505 --> 36:01.530
Keith needs to be with someone right now.

36:02.851 --> 36:04.044
I need a change.

36:06.037 --> 36:08.595
I figured since the season’s over, it’s time.

36:10.791 --> 36:15.057
Plus, I know I’m leaving Haley in good hands.

36:19.819 --> 36:21.042
I got to tell you, man.

36:22.199 --> 36:26.935
I never thought, when we played that one on one game, that I’d end up back here, feeling like this.

36:27.873 --> 36:28.573
Like what?

36:29.956 --> 36:31.062
Like I’m going to miss you.

36:35.225 --> 36:36.581
You’ve got to do what you feel.

36:37.851 --> 36:39.838
I actually wish you weren’t going to leave.

36:42.147 --> 36:44.793
Because you’re one hell of a basketball player.

36:47.533 --> 36:48.910
And because you’re my brother.

36:53.253 --> 36:54.599
Take care of yourself, man.

36:56.099 --> 36:57.436
You take care of Haley.

37:04.506 --> 37:07.026
I’ll miss you too, little brother.

37:29.808 --> 37:30.683
You all set?

37:33.402 --> 37:34.487
Yeah, almost.

37:38.406 --> 37:39.803
Come here, I want to talk to you a minute.

37:46.412 --> 37:48.429
I know you’re searching for things, Lucas.

37:49.673 --> 37:53.483
And I hope with all my heart that you find the answers to your questions.

37:54.826 --> 37:58.410
But the answers that you’re looking for are closer than you think.

38:00.729 --> 38:01.948
They’re in your heart.

38:03.063 --> 38:08.281
And in the hearts of those who love you. And that is right here. At home.

38:09.864 --> 38:15.019
In your life you’re going to go to some great places, and you’re going to do some wonderful things.

38:16.518 --> 38:19.934
But no matter where you go, or who you become,

38:21.148 --> 38:23.529
this place will always be with you.

38:32.986 --> 38:35.069
There is only one Tree Hill.

38:37.169 --> 38:38.673
And it’s your home.

38:44.750 --> 38:46.118
I love you, my boy.

38:48.426 --> 38:49.563
I love you, too.

39:18.537 --> 39:20.565
It looks like a beautiful morning.

39:21.046 --> 39:21.871
It’s perfect.

39:23.623 --> 39:25.117
Let’s do something great today.

40:22.138 --> 40:23.946
We have your test results.

40:51.061 --> 40:55.092
Dan! Can you hear me?

40:56.751 --> 41:01.889
Deb, you better hope I die.

41:12.072 --> 41:15.003
Hey, is Haley here?

41:15.541 --> 41:18.199
- I promised her I’d see her before I left.
- Yeah, come on in.

41:24.760 --> 41:27.522
- Nathan, where’s your sweatshirt?
- It’s in the bathroom.

41:32.683 --> 41:33.390
Hey.

41:34.409 --> 41:37.260
Hey, um, you know, I’m sorry to...

41:38.366 --> 41:41.987
- I just wanted to say goodbye.
- No, no it’s okay. I didn’t want you to go without...

41:42.058 --> 41:44.849
- No, I’m sorry. I’m just going to go.
- No, Lucas, please don’t.

41:44.936 --> 41:46.794
Haley! It’s cool, I just...

41:48.596 --> 41:49.815
I thought you weren’t ready.

41:50.295 --> 41:51.940
I thought that you were going to wait until you got married.

41:52.647 --> 41:53.691
I mean, I just figured...

41:57.505 --> 42:00.232
- I didn’t expect you to...
- Well we did.

42:01.924 --> 42:03.194
We did wait.

42:07.181 --> 42:08.892
What are you talking about, Haley?

42:13.054 --> 42:14.708
We got married last night.

42:28.551 --> 42:32.587
Some people believe that Ravens guide travelers to their destinations.

42:33.918 --> 42:38.486
Others believe that the sight of a solitary raven is considered good luck.

42:42.440 --> 42:44.534
While more than one raven together,

42:47.098 --> 42:48.546
predicts trouble ahead.

42:49.305 --> 42:55.429
