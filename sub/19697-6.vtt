00:18.880 --> 00:22.080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:25.480 --> 00:28.080
Hello, and welcome to Top Gear.

00:28.080 --> 00:32.080
Tonight, Chris and Rory head to Cuba to kick-start another revolution.

00:32.080 --> 00:34.960
This time it's not communism, it's corners.

00:34.960 --> 00:38.840
But first, I may have mentioned a time or two that I like

00:38.840 --> 00:43.280
a Porsche 911. And I especially like this one, the GT3 RS.

00:43.280 --> 00:46.600
It's less car, more surgical instrument.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.640
See, for years, if you'd wanted something for the road AND

00:49.640 --> 00:52.520
the track, this has been the answer.

00:52.520 --> 00:56.000
The benchmark, the undisputed champion.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.360
But now there's a new contender that quietly begs to differ.

01:03.880 --> 01:08.080
It comes from Mercedes. And it's called the AMG GT R.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.440
Like the 911 GT3 RS, it costs about £140,000.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.560
But you get the sense that in creating the GT R,

01:19.560 --> 01:23.200
the goal was less surgical instrument,

01:23.200 --> 01:25.160
more the Hulk.

01:27.360 --> 01:30.840
And, just like the Hulk, you wouldn't like it when it's angry.

01:36.040 --> 01:40.440
Whoa! Whoa! I don't know what it's so upset about, but it seems really,

01:40.440 --> 01:41.560
really mad.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
This thing is alive. Oh, it's just brimming with energy.

01:49.520 --> 01:54.640
Underneath that bonnet is a four-litre, twin-turbocharged V8.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.040
I've got 580 horsepower.

01:58.040 --> 02:01.360
I've got more than 500lb-ft of torque.

02:03.480 --> 02:07.600
And in the exhaust is a trigger-happy firing squad.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.440
EXHAUST RUMBLES Bang.

02:09.440 --> 02:10.840
EXHAUST RUMBLES

02:10.840 --> 02:12.000
There goes another one.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.560
EXHAUST RUMBLES And another one.

02:14.560 --> 02:17.720
And all that noise comes with plenty of speed.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.240
Whoa-ho!

02:25.240 --> 02:28.840
0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds.

02:28.840 --> 02:31.760
But the GT R feels faster.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.680
As for top speed...

02:36.920 --> 02:40.640
Well, Mercedes says the GT R isn't really about

02:40.640 --> 02:46.120
top speed, they're not bothered. So, flat out, it'll only do 198mph.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.160
I know. I'll do my best to cope.

02:54.440 --> 02:55.760
Fantastic!

03:01.680 --> 03:06.080
But to be a true GT3 RS rival, the big question is,

03:06.080 --> 03:07.280
how does it corner?

03:08.520 --> 03:12.640
And to be honest, this is the bit I'm kind of nervous about.

03:12.640 --> 03:16.160
Because the normal AMG GT, the car Mercedes put on

03:16.160 --> 03:21.600
a Russian Olympic diet to make this GT R, that car has a lot of pitch

03:21.600 --> 03:26.200
under braking, which makes it twitchy and unpredictable on corners.

03:26.200 --> 03:30.000
It's basically... You never know when it's going to bite you in the ass.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.400
And this car, they've given more power and less weight,

03:34.400 --> 03:37.760
which essentially makes it even bitier.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.480
This could be interesting.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.840
Oh, that's not bitey! That's brilliant.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.360
There's so much grip.

04:03.360 --> 04:06.600
That's because underneath that Marvel Comics paint job,

04:06.600 --> 04:09.400
there's a lightweight titanium exhaust,

04:09.400 --> 04:14.480
a race-tuned suspension, a whole new track-focused aero package...

04:16.000 --> 04:19.040
..and my favourite bit, rear-wheel steering.

04:21.279 --> 04:24.040
See it? See it move? Cool, right?

04:25.160 --> 04:29.200
And that makes the GT R super agile in the slow corners,

04:29.200 --> 04:32.680
but super stable in the higher speed corners.

04:32.680 --> 04:35.680
And the suspension keeps the car so flat, you can really tell

04:35.680 --> 04:39.160
what the tyres are up to and know exactly how hard you can push it.

04:41.480 --> 04:44.720
Oh, yeah! That is nice.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.200
That's real nice. HE LAUGHS

04:47.200 --> 04:49.160
I love it.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.160
And at top speed,

04:51.160 --> 04:56.640
this thing makes 155 kilos more downforce than the normal AMG GT.

04:56.640 --> 05:00.320
I mean, me personally, I'd say it feels more like 153, 154,

05:00.320 --> 05:02.680
but, you know, I don't want to nit-pick.

05:02.680 --> 05:07.080
Now, as a rule, to be a serious track weapon, a car should have its

05:07.080 --> 05:11.480
engine in the middle, not underneath a long bonnet way out in the front.

05:11.480 --> 05:14.480
But with the GT R, looks can be deceiving.

05:16.160 --> 05:18.000
Take a look at this.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.200
This isn't the engine,

05:20.200 --> 05:23.600
it's just a cover to hide a bunch of crap nobody wants to see.

05:23.600 --> 05:27.080
This is the engine. Behind the front wheels.

05:27.080 --> 05:30.440
So this IS a mid-engined car,

05:30.440 --> 05:33.960
you just don't sit in front of the engine, you sit behind it.

05:36.280 --> 05:39.400
All of which makes it pretty handy around a racetrack,

05:39.400 --> 05:43.200
including, yes, that German racetrack.

05:43.200 --> 05:48.400
Late last year, this car lapped the Nurburgring in 7 minutes, 11 seconds.

05:48.400 --> 05:52.200
Now, say what you want about Nurburgring times, but that's way quicker

05:52.200 --> 05:57.200
than a Ferrari 488, way quicker than a Corvette ZR1,

05:57.200 --> 06:02.480
and, oh, yeah, way quicker than the Porsche GT3 RS.

06:04.360 --> 06:07.680
Mercedes says no rear-drive road car has ever gone quicker.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.400
So don't let its appearance fool you.

06:12.400 --> 06:16.200
Yeah, the GT R might look like it wants to kick you in the cubes,

06:16.200 --> 06:20.040
but this really is a sophisticated track machine.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.720
A genuine Porsche rival.

06:22.720 --> 06:25.200
And I've got to say, I think that's a shame.

06:26.280 --> 06:31.080
Because Mercedes, well, AMG, has spent years and years making

06:31.080 --> 06:36.560
tyre-smoking, socially unacceptable, nutjob cars.

06:36.560 --> 06:39.680
And you don't want to throw away a reputation like that just for

06:39.680 --> 06:45.120
a Nurburgring lap time and a little, tiny spat with Porsche.

06:45.120 --> 06:48.600
And you know what, they haven't.

06:48.600 --> 06:52.120
That AMG animal is still in there.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.400
You just have to unlock the cage.

06:55.560 --> 06:59.280
And the key is in the GT R's race-car spec,

06:59.280 --> 07:02.000
nine-stage traction control system.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.600
Here, in technical terms, is how it works. This end...

07:07.800 --> 07:09.520
..Bruce Banner.

07:09.520 --> 07:11.600
This end...

07:11.600 --> 07:13.080
..the Hulk.

07:13.080 --> 07:16.960
And so far today, I've been sticking to the Bruce Banner end.

07:16.960 --> 07:20.480
But do you know what happens when you turn it to the Hulk end?

07:23.720 --> 07:25.680
It gets mad.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.000
HE CHUCKLES

07:27.000 --> 07:28.680
ENGINE REVS

07:28.680 --> 07:30.320
TYRES SCREECH

07:41.720 --> 07:43.960
I'm out of control, and I love it.

07:51.720 --> 07:54.440
OK, that's definitely not the fastest way around a corner,

07:54.440 --> 07:56.120
but it sure is exhilarating.

08:04.320 --> 08:07.320
This car is a hooligan, a hooligan.

08:17.840 --> 08:22.960
This is an AMG. No doubt about it.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.520
Troublemaker! You're a troublemaker. But I love you.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.039
You know what, I was wrong.

08:34.039 --> 08:38.360
I mean, yeah, sure, this car can play the part of a precise, sophisticated

08:38.360 --> 08:43.520
rival to the GT3 RS, but what it really is

08:43.520 --> 08:45.120
is a muscle car.

08:45.120 --> 08:48.280
A muscle car built by the best F1 team on the planet,

08:48.280 --> 08:50.880
and that is a very, very good thing.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.920
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

09:10.880 --> 09:14.080
- Wow! I mean, just look at it.
- Yeah.

09:14.080 --> 09:17.920
Look at it! It's just so... green.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.480
LAUGHTER

09:19.480 --> 09:22.120
- Well, you're perceptive.
- No, I've been doing this a while.

09:22.120 --> 09:25.080
I tell you what, though, this is not going to impress Nissan.

09:25.080 --> 09:26.920
OK, what has that have to do with them?

09:26.920 --> 09:31.400
Nissan has built an entire brand around building a front engine,

09:31.400 --> 09:34.480
turbo-charged sports car called the GT-R.

09:34.480 --> 09:37.320
Yeah? AMG comes along, builds a front engine,

09:37.320 --> 09:40.960
- turbo-charged sports car called the GT R.
- No, no, no.

09:40.960 --> 09:46.080
See, the Nissan GT-R, that's GT hyphen R.

09:46.080 --> 09:49.120
This is a GT no hyphen R.

09:49.120 --> 09:51.600
- Completely different.
- Come on.

09:51.600 --> 09:55.720
So, I choose to release a brown liquid beverage called

09:55.720 --> 09:59.200
- Coca Cola, no hyphen, and that's absolutely fine?
- No, no.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.480
First of all, anything that starts with you releasing

10:01.480 --> 10:04.560
a brown liquid is definitely not fine. No, no, no.

10:04.560 --> 10:07.080
Right, now it's time for the big movement... Moment. Oh!

10:07.080 --> 10:08.400
LAUGHTER

10:08.400 --> 10:12.600
We need to find out how quick the GT no hyphen R is around our test track,

10:12.600 --> 10:16.480
and you know what that means. It's time for... The Stig.

10:16.480 --> 10:18.280
Off the line.

10:18.280 --> 10:21.160
Managing traction, he short shifts to second quite quickly.

10:21.160 --> 10:23.440
Now, this long run down to first corner.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.480
Let's look what it looks like as it turns in.

10:25.480 --> 10:28.560
Really flat, controlling all that roll, looks fast,

10:28.560 --> 10:30.720
but oversteer on the exit, managing it.

10:32.640 --> 10:35.560
Now blending left, into Chicago.

10:37.520 --> 10:40.760
A tight line so he can get it opened up and get on the gas.

10:40.760 --> 10:42.880
It just looks like it wants to oversteer everywhere,

10:42.880 --> 10:47.000
but it looks stiff, doesn't it? It looks flat and it looks agile.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.880
Braking hard, triggering those warning lights.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.960
Hammerhead, what's it like through the right-hander direction change?

10:52.960 --> 10:54.480
Really good, actually.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.880
Turned well, coming out, managing oversteer again.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.840
But it seems that once he gets through that initial slip,

11:00.840 --> 11:04.520
he's got really good traction. Through the follow-through.

11:04.520 --> 11:06.560
That's just fast and flat again.

11:06.560 --> 11:09.920
What's it going to be like when it booms through the tyres?

11:09.920 --> 11:11.960
Now, that was really, really fast.

11:11.960 --> 11:15.440
Using all the circuit and the trail brake. Into second to last.

11:15.440 --> 11:18.440
Look at that, good, controlled driving from Stig.

11:18.440 --> 11:22.320
Now, rolling down towards Gambon and over the line.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.800
I think that's going to be a really fast time.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.080
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

11:27.080 --> 11:28.400
Quick. Quick.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.120
OK, now...

11:31.120 --> 11:36.800
The old AMG GTS did it in 1.17.5, which, that's pretty quick, too.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.680
- That's a fast time.
- That is a fast time.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.640
So we're looking to be somewhere way up here.

11:40.640 --> 11:44.200
Now, the new AMG GT R did it in

11:44.200 --> 11:45.800
one minute...

11:45.800 --> 11:49.240
16 flat. That's right there.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.680
APPLAUSE

11:51.680 --> 11:56.480
- That is seriously quick.
- That's a quick time. And...

11:56.480 --> 12:03.640
And in the same conditions, we got The Stig to lap the GT3 RS. OK.

12:03.640 --> 12:07.560
Now, the GT3 RS did it in one minute...

12:07.560 --> 12:10.200
16.1.

12:10.200 --> 12:13.600
So... move that Veyron down.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.240
Get that thing out of the way.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.440
LAUGHTER

12:16.440 --> 12:18.200
All right, there's that.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.040
There it is, in black and white -

12:20.040 --> 12:22.360
the Mercedes is faster.

12:22.360 --> 12:24.240
It is faster.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.920
- I'd still have the Porsche, though.
- So would I.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.920
I would too. Rory.

12:28.920 --> 12:30.320
Loving that Merc.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.800
Just to save you looking it up,

12:31.800 --> 12:34.520
that's even faster than the Smart Fortwo went round our track

12:34.520 --> 12:35.840
a couple of weeks ago.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.040
I knew that Merc was quick.

12:38.040 --> 12:40.720
All right. OK...

12:40.720 --> 12:43.880
Now it's time to welcome this week's guest.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.280
He's a stand-up comedian, he also loves off-roaders,

12:46.280 --> 12:48.840
motorbikes and heavy machinery,

12:48.840 --> 12:51.440
so you two can probably just take off now. Yeah.

12:51.440 --> 12:54.560
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Ross Noble.

12:54.560 --> 12:57.120
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

12:59.760 --> 13:01.480
Hello, hello!

13:04.560 --> 13:06.480
- How are you doing?
- Hello.

13:07.640 --> 13:09.240
Thank you very much.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.480
- All right.
- Hi.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.120
Now, you are into your bikes, I know,

13:15.120 --> 13:16.920
so did you ride down or drive down?

13:16.920 --> 13:18.640
No, I drove down today.

13:18.640 --> 13:21.120
I brought my mate, so we came in the car.

13:21.120 --> 13:24.320
I thought it best to turn up to Top Gear in a car.

13:24.320 --> 13:25.680
OK. What did you drive?

13:25.680 --> 13:27.960
My Land Rover Defender.

13:27.960 --> 13:30.240
Defender, oh, OK.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.520
Standard Defender or any tweaks?

13:32.520 --> 13:34.600
No, massive tweaks.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.640
It's a Kahn, a fully customed...

13:37.640 --> 13:40.120
- What I've done, right, is I've taken...
- Ooh...

13:40.120 --> 13:43.480
I've taken a tin box and I've polished it up.

13:43.480 --> 13:44.800
There it is, look.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.840
That's my car. Look at it.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.280
It's a beauty. I love the styling, too.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.480
You've gone for the fully murdered-out look -

13:51.480 --> 13:54.120
- black on black on black. That's gangster.
- Proper gangster.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.960
You've got to admit that is a cool-looking thing.

13:56.960 --> 13:59.560
- Have I?
- Come on!

13:59.560 --> 14:00.960
I don't mind a Defender,

14:00.960 --> 14:04.080
but, I mean, the wheel arch extensions seem a bit...

14:04.080 --> 14:05.200
a bit much.

14:05.200 --> 14:08.200
It does look like it's trying a bit too hard.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.360
To be fair, I do live in the country.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.400
But don't the countryside folks sneer

14:12.400 --> 14:14.520
- at the fact that you've not got a normal Defender?
- Yes.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.320
They must see you as a bit arriviste

14:16.320 --> 14:18.040
and a bit like a townie in the country.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.040
Yeah. I like to annoy everyone.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.480
Equally, at the same time.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.680
Yes, it's... No, but the thing...

14:24.680 --> 14:26.800
I had, like, proper cars.

14:26.800 --> 14:31.120
I had a Golf GTI and we had a 1960 Karmann Ghia,

14:31.120 --> 14:33.480
beautiful, wonderful cars...

14:35.880 --> 14:39.080
The whole thing. It was like you were at the end of EastEnders.

14:39.080 --> 14:41.160
- Driving down the drive...
- LAUGHTER

14:41.160 --> 14:42.840
..as you were heading down to the road.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.880
HE IMITATES DOOF-DOOFS

14:44.880 --> 14:46.080
I wind the window down

14:46.080 --> 14:48.160
and start shouting Cockney things at people.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.560
What about the driving position? I'm not a big man,

14:50.560 --> 14:53.640
and I find myself in there and my elbow is just doing this.

14:53.640 --> 14:54.960
There's just no room in it.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.760
It's not comfortable at all.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.560
You are like that...

14:58.560 --> 14:59.760
You're sitting in it...

14:59.760 --> 15:02.360
This is us, like that. Like that.

15:02.360 --> 15:05.400
Then, I've got leather bucket seats in it as well,

15:05.400 --> 15:07.480
so I've taken the most uncomfortable car

15:07.480 --> 15:09.000
that money can buy

15:09.000 --> 15:11.200
and I've made it more uncomfortable.

15:11.200 --> 15:16.240
Short of paying a man to sit behind me and do this all day long...

15:16.240 --> 15:19.040
LAUGHTER

15:19.040 --> 15:20.800
You know...

15:20.800 --> 15:23.320
So, what was your first car?

15:23.320 --> 15:27.320
My first car, I had a... It was a Metro.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.960
An MG Metro, it was.

15:28.960 --> 15:32.080
I bought it off another comic for 150 quid.

15:32.080 --> 15:35.640
He said to me, "That car is perfect.

15:35.640 --> 15:41.440
"Just don't drive it over 70mph or it will go horribly wrong."

15:41.440 --> 15:43.680
I thought, "That's fair enough." So I never drove it...

15:43.680 --> 15:46.360
Then there was one night I was a bit late,

15:46.360 --> 15:48.600
and I sort of maybe exceeded the speed limit a little bit.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.320
I pulled up outside my house,

15:50.320 --> 15:51.520
I closed the door...

15:51.520 --> 15:52.960
and it burst into flames.

15:52.960 --> 15:55.840
It just literally burst into flames.

15:55.840 --> 15:58.000
But you do drive yourself to gigs?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.120
Yeah, cos I had this instance...

16:00.120 --> 16:03.760
This is one of the reasons why I thought it was important to drive.

16:03.760 --> 16:07.800
I was at a train station and all the trains were delayed.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.200
There was a replacement bus service.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.400
This old woman was there...

16:12.400 --> 16:15.480
It was a weird, strange old lady. She was wearing sandals.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.480
She had long, claw-like nails,

16:18.480 --> 16:22.040
which should have, sort of, rung alarm bells for me.

16:22.040 --> 16:24.240
She said, "Where are you going?"

16:24.240 --> 16:25.880
I said, "Wolverhampton", or somewhere.

16:25.880 --> 16:28.680
She went, "I'll drive you. I'm going there anyway."

16:28.680 --> 16:32.200
This woman got me in her car and she...

16:32.200 --> 16:33.600
We drove to...

16:33.600 --> 16:35.920
We started driving, and then she said...

16:35.920 --> 16:37.720
You know, chatting away and all the rest of it.

16:37.720 --> 16:39.400
She went, "I want you to meet my daughter."

16:39.400 --> 16:41.000
She said, "Come and cheer her up."

16:41.000 --> 16:45.360
So, basically, she kidnapped me and drove me to a house.

16:45.360 --> 16:47.440
Then her daughter, who was sort of bleary eyed,

16:47.440 --> 16:49.560
she dragged her out of bed and she went,

16:49.560 --> 16:51.800
"Go on. Cheer her up."

16:51.800 --> 16:53.520
So I was now...

16:53.520 --> 16:56.320
"Or you'll get the claw."

16:56.320 --> 16:58.080
"I'll rip your gizzards out."

16:58.080 --> 17:01.320
So I was then just in this house, just in this...

17:01.320 --> 17:03.360
I'm going, "No, no, I really have to...

17:03.360 --> 17:04.839
"I have to get to where I'm going."

17:04.839 --> 17:06.240
She went, "No, no, go on."

17:06.240 --> 17:08.640
The daughter didn't want this to be happening,

17:08.640 --> 17:10.760
I didn't want it to be happening. It was all horrible.

17:10.760 --> 17:13.000
I went, "I will never get the train again."

17:13.000 --> 17:15.040
Cos that's what happens - get the train,

17:15.040 --> 17:19.040
you'll end up in someone's house with a woman with claws.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.839
Have you been back to visit?

17:20.839 --> 17:22.960
Yeah, we're engaged to be married.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.760
She was most sensitive lover I've ever had.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.960
- Not the daughter, the old woman.
- Of course.

17:31.960 --> 17:36.160
I took my clothes off. I didn't even have to take my own socks off.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.480
She went...

17:38.480 --> 17:40.200
- OK, all right, all right.
- This is horrible.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.320
Let's get down to business.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.640
You've tackled the Top Gear track before

17:43.640 --> 17:46.200
- in the famous KIA Cee'd, right?
- Yes, I have.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.520
You were quick, real quick. Like the fifth fastest, right?

17:48.520 --> 17:49.560
Yeah, yeah.

17:49.560 --> 17:53.000
The most important thing is I beat Tom Cruise, because I...

17:53.000 --> 17:56.720
Not that I've become utterly insufferable since that day,

17:56.720 --> 18:00.040
but I mention that, I would say, at least once a day.

18:00.040 --> 18:01.640
He was in Days Of Thunder,

18:01.640 --> 18:03.480
and my wife... It's got to the point now where -

18:03.480 --> 18:05.280
since the last time I was on the show -

18:05.280 --> 18:06.400
we're literally sat there,

18:06.400 --> 18:08.680
if there's a new advert for a Tom Cruise film comes on...

18:08.680 --> 18:11.880
It will go, "Tom Cruise..." I'll go, and she'll go, "I know."

18:13.240 --> 18:17.160
I will sometimes say to complete strangers, "I beat Tom Cruise."

18:17.160 --> 18:19.640
Yes, well, yes, you did. You certainly did.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.440
A lot of people beat Tom Cruise.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.720
All right, but now we've got the more challenging GT86.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.320
That's a proper sports car.

18:28.320 --> 18:31.120
How did it go there? How did your training with Chris go?

18:31.120 --> 18:34.200
It was... You know what? It was incredible. It was such good fun.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.440
It was great fun.

18:35.440 --> 18:38.960
But that old car was just, "Come on."

18:38.960 --> 18:41.600
This thing, it's got, like...

18:41.600 --> 18:46.360
- It moves around and it's quite...
- Yeah.

18:46.360 --> 18:49.480
- Yeah, great.
- Chris, what do you think?

18:49.480 --> 18:51.560
What he said.

18:51.560 --> 18:54.480
It was interesting. The training was interesting.

18:54.480 --> 18:58.240
But I saw a kernel of talent in there. Let's see what happened.

18:58.240 --> 19:00.640
All right, let's take a look.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.840
Before we start, all I'm going to say,

19:02.840 --> 19:05.680
these are the best conditions we've had all series.

19:05.680 --> 19:08.200
Are we driving or going for a picnic?

19:08.200 --> 19:11.680
Well, we will find out. Let's go. Come on.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.240
Just remember that the slow-speed corners

19:14.240 --> 19:16.520
give you a better chance to make time up.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.800
Braking hard. Brake hard. Second gear, please.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.360
Second gear. We're going round to the right.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.320
You've got fourth, you've got forth.

19:23.320 --> 19:24.400
BLEEP.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.760
There's the white lines.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.440
That way, then.

19:28.440 --> 19:31.000
Round to the left. Second gear, please. Second gear.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.160
Round to the right, round to the right.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.720
Round to the right. Second gear. You're in fourth again. Second.

19:35.720 --> 19:37.400
Oh, cock.

19:37.400 --> 19:39.200
It's in there somewhere. It's in there.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.000
- Third?
- Third, over to left, over to the left.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.040
- Don't worry, don't panic.
- I'm not panicking.

19:44.040 --> 19:46.640
A bit of third gear, a bit of third gear, please.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.040
This could be interesting.

19:52.680 --> 19:55.360
Brake, brake, brake.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.000
Brake that hard?

19:57.000 --> 19:58.280
Or not quite as hard.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.680
CHRIS LAUGHS

20:00.680 --> 20:03.280
- Just thrown a load of fuel there, hasn't it?
- That's fine.

20:03.280 --> 20:05.200
When you're strapped into a metal box,

20:05.200 --> 20:08.680
it's nice to smell fuel just all around you.

20:08.680 --> 20:10.880
It's fine. It's all part of the thrill.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.120
Give it some gas. Over the line.

20:14.120 --> 20:15.200
We didn't die.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.680
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

20:27.440 --> 20:29.360
There was a moment there...

20:29.360 --> 20:33.000
We spin and we were going backwards for quite a long time. 70pmh.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.600
It was brilliant!

20:36.440 --> 20:37.480
This is the thing,

20:37.480 --> 20:40.080
it's not like a motorbike where if you come off a motorbike

20:40.080 --> 20:41.640
you really hurt yourself,

20:41.640 --> 20:43.400
whereas this, you know,

20:43.400 --> 20:47.200
it's just a smell of petrol and another man's poo.

20:50.520 --> 20:52.800
OK, time to talk about Cuba.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.000
When you hear that name, you know what springs to mind -

20:55.000 --> 20:57.400
all those incredible old American cars.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.400
The ones that have kept going since Castro and communism took over

21:00.400 --> 21:01.640
back in the '50s.

21:01.640 --> 21:02.840
But over the past few years,

21:02.840 --> 21:04.920
Cuba has been opening up to the West.

21:04.920 --> 21:08.840
That means the days of those iconic cars could be numbered.

21:08.840 --> 21:11.000
So, with a budget of £5,000 each,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.320
Chris and I bought a couple of old sports cars,

21:13.320 --> 21:15.120
that we thought would impress the locals,

21:15.120 --> 21:18.000
and headed out to hunt down the Cuban classics.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.440
Our landing spot in the world's most westerly communist state

21:24.440 --> 21:25.760
was the Bay Of Pigs...

21:27.920 --> 21:29.880
..site of an American-backed invasion

21:29.880 --> 21:34.120
defeated by Fidel Castro's regime in 1961.

21:35.560 --> 21:39.360
Since then, Cuba has shut its doors to the West.

21:39.360 --> 21:44.000
A generation of '50s American cars left stranded inside.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.120
The fight to maintain them has gone on ever since.

21:47.120 --> 21:49.000
Those still running survive

21:49.000 --> 21:52.360
thanks to the resourceful mechanical spirit of this unique nation.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.480
That's what we had come for,

21:57.480 --> 21:59.840
but what had we brought with us?

22:03.640 --> 22:06.240
I'm not going to lie, I am so chuffed at what I've got here.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.040
Right, let's see what you brought, then.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.600
Come on. Look at this.

22:09.600 --> 22:14.040
'Now, surely, in a nation with a passion for old American cars...'

22:14.040 --> 22:15.760
Prepare to be amazed.

22:15.760 --> 22:18.000
'..there is only one sensible choice.'

22:18.000 --> 22:20.520
THEME FROM THE GODFATHER

22:20.520 --> 22:23.120
- Oh, that's Italian.
- Yes!

22:26.280 --> 22:30.840
I present to you the Maserati Biturbo

22:30.840 --> 22:34.200
or as they insist you call it, the BIH-turbo.

22:34.200 --> 22:35.720
Amazing, eh?

22:35.720 --> 22:37.080
Yes. It's amazing.

22:37.080 --> 22:39.920
It's amazing that you managed to drive it out of the container

22:39.920 --> 22:41.480
without it breaking down.

22:41.480 --> 22:44.240
Oh, good, the old "Maseratis aren't reliable" gag.

22:44.240 --> 22:45.640
Look, let me explain this to you.

22:45.640 --> 22:48.120
This car is just plain fantastic.

22:48.120 --> 22:49.960
First of all, it's a Maserati.

22:49.960 --> 22:54.040
It has a 2.6 litre, twin-turbo V6,

22:54.040 --> 22:56.320
styling, a manual gearbox, and...

22:56.320 --> 23:01.080
and, in this country, Maseratis are racing royalty.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.120
Racing royalty?

23:02.120 --> 23:04.080
I'll explain that later on. What have you chosen?

23:04.080 --> 23:06.040
Watch and learn.

23:06.040 --> 23:10.360
How to outdo your Maserati in one fell swoop.

23:10.360 --> 23:12.040
'Like I said...'

23:12.040 --> 23:15.280
- ENGINE TURNS OVER
- Oh, yeah.

23:15.280 --> 23:16.320
ROCK MUSIC

23:20.240 --> 23:21.680
- Huh?
- Ah-hah.

23:26.040 --> 23:29.920
What you are looking at is a Chevy Camaro,

23:29.920 --> 23:32.840
the quintessential American muscle car.

23:35.320 --> 23:40.520
- Start up front. Under the bonnet, a five-litre American V8.
- Yes.

23:40.520 --> 23:44.720
- 170 horsepower.
- Sorry, stop there. Repeat that.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.480
170.

23:46.480 --> 23:47.920
But the thing is, 170's still...

23:47.920 --> 23:51.320
How do you try and get so little power from such a big engine?

23:51.320 --> 23:53.320
Well, they're concentrating on torque

23:53.320 --> 23:54.920
more than anything else, all right?

23:54.920 --> 23:57.400
So it's all about the grunt. But that's not the only thing.

23:57.400 --> 24:00.520
- Yes.
- Check this out. Round the back. Come on. Watch this.

24:00.520 --> 24:03.080
You don't slam the Camaro's boot.

24:03.080 --> 24:06.560
You place it gently down. Soft close.

24:06.560 --> 24:08.320
Straight out of a Mercedes S-Class.

24:08.320 --> 24:12.520
So the best thing about your muscle car is the soft-close boot?

24:12.520 --> 24:15.640
Well, it's ONE of the things about my muscle car.

24:15.640 --> 24:17.520
I think we should go. Come on.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.120
Childish.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.640
If, admittedly, quite cool.

24:29.440 --> 24:30.720
Let's roll.

24:36.040 --> 24:38.880
Excited to see what the locals would make of our choices,

24:38.880 --> 24:41.560
we decided to pick our way north-west,

24:41.560 --> 24:43.920
towards the capital city, Havana.

24:47.760 --> 24:49.960
And, as our Cuban adventure got under way,

24:49.960 --> 24:52.880
we got better acquainted with our cars.

24:56.920 --> 25:00.120
This is meant to be the less sophisticated car of the two,

25:00.120 --> 25:01.840
and yet everything works.

25:01.840 --> 25:05.280
My electric windows work, my cruise control works...

25:05.280 --> 25:07.560
Well, nearly everything.

25:07.560 --> 25:09.960
My knob has come off.

25:09.960 --> 25:11.280
I won't tell Chris about that.

25:12.880 --> 25:16.480
The Camaro is a kind of car that speaks to you on a base level.

25:16.480 --> 25:20.560
It's all about that growl, it sounds good, it feels powerful.

25:20.560 --> 25:24.480
It makes me feel cool. That's what muscle cars are all about.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.200
That's what Cuba's all about.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.120
It feels special to me.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.200
Maybe it's just because it's got a Maserati badge,

25:33.200 --> 25:35.120
but the dogleg gearbox feels great.

25:35.120 --> 25:36.840
Really positive.

25:36.840 --> 25:40.520
The engine has that suggestive V6 note,

25:40.520 --> 25:42.280
which is so much more sophisticated

25:42.280 --> 25:45.000
than Rory's loud, brash American car.

25:46.160 --> 25:49.040
Yes. We're going to go on well, me and the Maserati.

25:51.760 --> 25:54.080
Because, despite Rory's scepticism,

25:54.080 --> 25:56.760
this was the perfect car to win over the locals.

26:00.080 --> 26:03.360
You see, Cuba once had its own Grand Prix.

26:03.360 --> 26:07.160
The first was staged in 1957 and won by none other

26:07.160 --> 26:11.320
than Juan Manuel Fangio in a Maserati.

26:11.320 --> 26:14.160
A year later, the five-time Formula 1 World Champion

26:14.160 --> 26:16.240
returned to compete again,

26:16.240 --> 26:18.160
but he never made the race.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.400
- NEWSREEL:
- Miguel Fangio was kidnapped by Cuban rebels

26:20.400 --> 26:23.480
in a daring move to discredit the regime.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.360
Yep, kidnapped.

26:25.360 --> 26:29.600
In 1960, the last Grand Prix ever to be staged in Cuba

26:29.600 --> 26:33.600
was won by Stirling Moss in... a Maserati.

26:37.160 --> 26:40.720
So two thirds of all Grand Prix on this fair island

26:40.720 --> 26:43.640
were won by Maserati. Isn't that amazing?

26:43.640 --> 26:46.720
That is very cool. That kind of makes sense.

26:46.720 --> 26:49.040
It's a classy move. I'll give you that.

26:53.240 --> 26:56.480
'Soon we came across a town called Coliseo.'

26:56.480 --> 26:59.520
Look at the architecture. This is incredible.

26:59.520 --> 27:02.760
It's like being stuck in a time warp.

27:02.760 --> 27:05.520
'And with our first Cubans to impress...

27:05.520 --> 27:07.480
'Rory wasted no time.'

27:07.480 --> 27:09.120
ENGINE REVS

27:11.720 --> 27:14.000
Chris, I am speaking to the people of Cuba in

27:14.000 --> 27:17.120
a language they understand - V8 pipes.

27:17.120 --> 27:20.280
- CAR REVS REPEATEDLY
- That means "Hello."

27:20.280 --> 27:23.080
- CAR REVS REPEATEDLY
- That means "How are you?"

27:23.080 --> 27:24.640
CAR REVS REPEATEDLY

27:24.640 --> 27:28.600
And that means, "Don't bother looking at the Maserati behind me."

27:28.600 --> 27:30.880
I'm just going to hang back a little bit,

27:30.880 --> 27:32.640
because it really is quite cringeworthy.

27:32.640 --> 27:33.800
'Annoyingly, though,

27:33.800 --> 27:36.560
'the people of Coliseo appeared to have forgotten

27:36.560 --> 27:38.480
'their racing heritage.'

27:38.480 --> 27:43.080
Quick question - is anyone gathered around your car having a look?

27:43.080 --> 27:44.520
ENGINE REVS

27:48.160 --> 27:51.040
It doesn't seem quite as popular as yours.

27:51.040 --> 27:55.560
Bask in the glory of the V-ocho.

27:55.560 --> 27:57.840
THEY EXCLAIM

28:02.200 --> 28:04.440
'Although clearly misled by Reid,

28:04.440 --> 28:07.040
'the locals were definitely car lovers.

28:07.040 --> 28:11.280
'They told us of a secretive drag race taking place that afternoon

28:11.280 --> 28:13.600
'in a town further north called Varadero.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.840
'So, with our adventure starting to gather momentum,

28:19.840 --> 28:21.160
'we got back on the road.'

28:25.040 --> 28:27.360
There's a bloke here who can't stop his horse.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.520
Have you spotted him?

28:28.520 --> 28:31.800
He has no control over that animal at all. He's just gone left.

28:31.800 --> 28:34.520
No, it's gone left with him on it.

28:34.520 --> 28:37.600
'Yes, with every mile we drove deeper

28:37.600 --> 28:39.920
'into the Cuban time capsule.'

28:39.920 --> 28:43.680
We're starting to see some proper old American cars now.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.320
This is more like it.

28:45.320 --> 28:47.920
'And it wasn't just the number of old cars,

28:47.920 --> 28:51.920
'it was the lack of almost any new ones at all.'

28:51.920 --> 28:55.720
In the last few years, Cubans have been able to buy new cars.

28:55.720 --> 28:58.280
As ever with Cuba, it's not as straightforward as that.

28:58.280 --> 29:01.560
The average national wage here is about $20 a month,

29:01.560 --> 29:03.960
but they are colossally expensive

29:03.960 --> 29:07.040
because of import duties and other stuff.

29:07.040 --> 29:12.480
So, for example, Peugeot 508 - in the UK, 20 grand-ish.

29:12.480 --> 29:17.040
Here... £160,000.

29:17.040 --> 29:18.480
Get your head round that.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.120
'Which probably explained why the roads were lined

29:22.120 --> 29:24.640
'with people needing a ride.'

29:26.520 --> 29:28.840
You know the rules about hitchhiking here, mate.

29:28.840 --> 29:32.000
If you are in a state-owned car, you have to pick them up.

29:33.920 --> 29:37.320
I reckon we should join in with the local culture,

29:37.320 --> 29:39.560
pick ourselves up some hitchhikers.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.360
Why would we want to do that?

29:41.360 --> 29:43.560
Because it's all about community spirit here.

29:43.560 --> 29:46.360
People rely on each other to get things done.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.360
I don't share my car with anyone.

29:48.360 --> 29:51.200
When I go on holiday, everyone else goes in another car.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.680
I go on my own.

29:52.680 --> 29:56.320
'But since we weren't on holiday...'

29:56.320 --> 29:57.960
Right, follow me.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.000
Here we go.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.400
Living the Cuban dream.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.120
Hola.

30:03.120 --> 30:04.360
Just two of you, yeah?

30:05.840 --> 30:07.080
Thank you, thank you.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.760
I thought we had two.

30:09.760 --> 30:10.800
One, two...

30:13.640 --> 30:14.680
All of you?

30:20.960 --> 30:23.520
THEY EXCLAIM

30:26.080 --> 30:29.000
Reid, what on earth have you done here?

30:29.000 --> 30:30.720
How many have you got?

30:30.720 --> 30:33.360
I've got four in the back, one in the front.

30:35.880 --> 30:38.240
- MAN SPEAKS SPANISH
- How far? How far?

30:38.240 --> 30:40.040
The reason why we are here with the Maserati,

30:40.040 --> 30:41.760
I need to teach you about this...

30:41.760 --> 30:44.120
OVERLAPPING SPANISH CONVERSATIONS

30:44.120 --> 30:47.680
OK, more Cuban people that won't listen to me.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.600
'Still, could have been worse.'

30:49.600 --> 30:51.360
No, no, no, no!

30:51.360 --> 30:52.880
HE SCREAMS

30:52.880 --> 30:54.680
- HE LAUGHS
- No, no, no, no!

30:54.680 --> 30:56.440
No, no, dude, dude, dude, please, please.

30:56.440 --> 30:57.680
He's got a chicken!

30:57.680 --> 31:00.880
SCREECHING AND RUMBLING

31:00.880 --> 31:04.200
You are a complete fool, aren't you?

31:04.200 --> 31:05.960
HE SCREAMS

31:05.960 --> 31:09.160
- Loco! Loco!
- HE SCREAMS

31:11.440 --> 31:15.120
'A long time and not very far later...'

31:15.120 --> 31:17.560
- OK, this is the end.
- Yes, thank you.

31:17.560 --> 31:18.880
It's been a pleasure.

31:18.880 --> 31:19.960
HE SCREAMS

31:19.960 --> 31:24.400
I think... Whoa... No, no, no, no. I'm done. Out of the car. I'm out.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.280
I am out.

31:26.280 --> 31:29.040
Chris, this was a bad idea.

31:34.560 --> 31:35.760
Rory...

31:37.480 --> 31:39.320
Yes.

31:39.320 --> 31:43.880
If you have any other bright ideas for cultural exploration,

31:43.880 --> 31:45.800
keep them to yourself, all right?

31:47.480 --> 31:48.680
Yes.

31:53.480 --> 31:57.080
'Back on the road, before long, we reached Varadero.

31:57.080 --> 31:59.640
'And arriving at the drag race...'

31:59.640 --> 32:02.280
Oh, yes. Look at this.

32:02.280 --> 32:03.880
This is the place.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.320
'..it didn't disappoint.'

32:30.160 --> 32:33.640
'Motor racing has been illegal in Cuba since 1962,

32:33.640 --> 32:36.280
'but with officials starting to turn a blind eye,

32:36.280 --> 32:37.720
'in the last few years,

32:37.720 --> 32:41.080
'gatherings like these have slowly begun to surface.'

32:43.440 --> 32:47.800
'And now we'd found one, we had to see what they were running.'

32:47.800 --> 32:49.640
- Look at this.
- Is that a Chevy?

32:49.640 --> 32:51.880
Wow. Look at that.

32:51.880 --> 32:54.600
That is class.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.120
- Hello.
- Hello!

32:58.000 --> 32:59.440
5.7.

32:59.440 --> 33:01.600
5.7 litre. Did you do all of this work yourself?

33:01.600 --> 33:05.240
- Yes, yes, yes.
- How long did it take you to create this?
- Ten years.

33:05.240 --> 33:09.440
- Ten years?
- Yes.
- How much power?
- 400.
- 400?

33:09.440 --> 33:13.440
- 400 horsepower.
- That is just beautiful, Rory.

33:13.440 --> 33:16.760
'And the more cars we looked at...'

33:16.760 --> 33:18.600
Look at that.

33:18.600 --> 33:21.440
'..the weirder and more wonderful they became.'

33:21.440 --> 33:23.840
What on earth did this used to be?

33:23.840 --> 33:24.960
Are those teeth?

33:24.960 --> 33:26.400
Buick 53.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.600
Buick.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.800
'68. '68 Camaro.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.720
Ah, OK.

33:33.720 --> 33:36.840
They sort of re-engineer them, don't they? What's over here?

33:36.840 --> 33:39.160
This is Mecca, as far as I'm concerned.

33:39.160 --> 33:40.800
Cuba is giving up the goods.

33:40.800 --> 33:45.320
'Yes, here in Varadero we had found some real motoring spirit.

33:47.000 --> 33:51.120
'And, in his excitement, Rory decided to compete with it.'

33:53.600 --> 33:56.880
Er, 0-60 in 9 seconds.

33:56.880 --> 33:58.040
This should go well.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.159
Come off it!

34:08.159 --> 34:10.000
He cheated!

34:10.000 --> 34:11.440
Man, that thing is quick.

34:12.800 --> 34:14.800
I am getting nowhere near this guy.

34:19.679 --> 34:21.840
Oh, man.

34:24.159 --> 34:27.520
I don't like losing, but I'll lose to that.

34:27.520 --> 34:28.760
What a machine!

34:30.560 --> 34:32.800
Did not stand a chance.

34:32.800 --> 34:36.520
- Rory.
- Yes.
- Let's discuss some of the basic skills of drag racing.

34:36.520 --> 34:39.719
- When the man says go, what do you do?
- Well, he picked the start.

34:39.719 --> 34:41.719
He left about half a second before me.

34:41.719 --> 34:44.280
He left when the guy said, "G..."

34:44.280 --> 34:46.239
That's what you're supposed to do in drag racing.

34:46.239 --> 34:48.520
You go on the "G" of "Go"!

34:48.520 --> 34:49.760
That was ridiculous.

34:52.199 --> 34:54.000
'After Rory's shambolic effort,

34:54.000 --> 34:57.240
'the stage was set for my thoroughbred to make its mark.'

35:02.000 --> 35:05.440
Yes, it was time for a little reminder of what

35:05.440 --> 35:07.840
the Maserati name really means.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.880
LAUGHTER

ENGINES ROAR

35:28.200 --> 35:29.760
Hey, come on!

35:31.320 --> 35:32.720
Look at it go.

35:36.680 --> 35:37.960
That is hopeless.

35:43.920 --> 35:44.960
Aw...

35:46.200 --> 35:48.520
It looked like you got destroyed, to me.

35:48.520 --> 35:49.640
Oh, no, no, no, no.

35:49.640 --> 35:52.720
It was a beating but it wasn't a drubbing, was it?

35:52.720 --> 35:54.800
- How many car lengths?
- Six.

35:54.800 --> 35:57.720
You got killed, mate. You got killed.

35:57.720 --> 36:02.920
OK, Cuba's racers had turned out to be a little quicker than expected,

36:02.920 --> 36:05.880
but there was still one victory worth fighting for.

36:05.880 --> 36:07.920
ENGINES ROAR

36:18.680 --> 36:20.760
Terrible launch! Terrible launch!

36:23.120 --> 36:24.520
Come on.

36:26.280 --> 36:28.240
- Yeah, look at this!
- CHRIS LAUGHS

36:28.240 --> 36:31.320
Where's he gone? Where's he gone?

36:31.320 --> 36:32.680
Ah!

36:35.240 --> 36:36.520
Harris is gone.

36:36.520 --> 36:37.920
Bye-bye, Rory Reid.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.640
Oh, no!

36:43.640 --> 36:45.040
Damn you!

36:46.880 --> 36:50.320
That was a really ungracious way to win, wasn't it?

36:50.320 --> 36:52.600
Oh, he's going to be unbearable!

36:59.320 --> 37:00.480
- Here we go.
- Now...

37:00.480 --> 37:02.720
- Here we go.
- Now, what exactly happened there, Rory?

37:02.720 --> 37:04.080
- Well, you won the race.
- OK.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.760
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.520
But, look, I'm not here to compete.

37:07.520 --> 37:10.560
I'm here to have a good time, meet some people, you know,

37:10.560 --> 37:12.760
and win some friends with my V8 engine note,

37:12.760 --> 37:15.040
drive with my top down and have a laugh.

37:15.040 --> 37:18.040
Who are you and what have you done with the Rory Reid that I know,

37:18.040 --> 37:20.840
- that is super-competitive and wants to win?
- Calm down, Chris.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.640
So, do you see this as a moral victory?

37:22.640 --> 37:26.360
Well, I actually do, but I also see you as a sore winner.

37:26.360 --> 37:28.560
- I've never seen that before.
- I like that phrase.

37:28.560 --> 37:30.640
I'll take that - a sore winner.

37:35.360 --> 37:37.400
CHEERING

37:38.720 --> 37:41.040
Oh, no.

37:41.040 --> 37:43.360
You guys got destroyed.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.000
Yeah, but at least I beat Rory.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.560
Yeah, look, at least the Cubans liked my car.

37:47.560 --> 37:50.240
Yeah, at least I didn't get mauled by a cock.

37:50.240 --> 37:51.800
All right, OK, guys, guys...

37:51.800 --> 37:53.680
Guys, come on, now. We're all friends.

37:53.680 --> 37:56.160
You both made bad choices, OK?

37:56.160 --> 37:58.680
We'll get back to the rest of that story a little later on,

37:58.680 --> 38:02.080
but, right now, it is Dream Garage time.

38:02.080 --> 38:05.640
OK, £350,000 you have to spend,

38:05.640 --> 38:09.560
and you want something that's just awesome, right?

38:09.560 --> 38:11.200
What do you get? Rory?

38:11.200 --> 38:13.920
Is this the bit where we name a car and then you show us

38:13.920 --> 38:17.840
a combine harvester or a massive blender for cows or something?

38:17.840 --> 38:19.680
LAUGHTER

38:19.680 --> 38:21.080
Why can't you just play the game?

38:21.080 --> 38:22.800
Can't you just...?

38:22.800 --> 38:26.200
Come on, £350,000, what do you get? Go. Come on.

38:26.200 --> 38:28.840
All right, OK, I could go a Rolls-Royce Wraith.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.800
I could go Ferrari 812 Superfast.

38:30.800 --> 38:33.040
Yeah, you could. Yup, yup. Chris?

38:33.040 --> 38:36.840
Short-wheelbase 1965 Porsche 911.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.200
Ah.

38:38.200 --> 38:40.880
Hey. See? Yeah, yeah.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.240
Both good suggestions.

38:42.240 --> 38:43.760
Both wrong suggestions...

38:43.760 --> 38:46.080
LAUGHTER ..because, for £350,000,

38:46.080 --> 38:48.800
you want one of these.

38:48.800 --> 38:53.120
LAUGHTER That is the Terex Fuchs MHL360.

38:53.120 --> 38:54.560
- Just look at it!
- Yeah.

38:56.240 --> 38:57.560
So, so, so...

38:57.560 --> 38:58.840
So that's a crane.

38:58.840 --> 39:01.120
What? What? No...

39:01.120 --> 39:02.640
A crane?

39:02.640 --> 39:04.360
No. Oh...

39:04.360 --> 39:06.720
Ross, will you please enlighten them?

39:06.720 --> 39:07.840
Yes, certainly.

39:07.840 --> 39:10.040
It's a material handler.

39:10.040 --> 39:11.400
Thank you.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.880
LAUGHTER That's right - a material handler.

39:13.880 --> 39:15.440
And do you know what it handles?

39:15.440 --> 39:18.520
A melon, a shed and a Volvo.

39:18.520 --> 39:20.240
Watch this.

39:20.240 --> 39:24.920
Hello. This is the Terex Fuchs MHL360,

39:24.920 --> 39:27.720
and it handles stuff really well.

39:27.720 --> 39:28.800
Check this out.

39:30.120 --> 39:32.400
OK, now, to help me with this,

39:32.400 --> 39:34.960
I brought my trusty digger-mate Ross Noble.

39:34.960 --> 39:38.120
He's going to help me play material handler bowling.

39:38.120 --> 39:39.760
He's super-confident.

39:39.760 --> 39:41.960
Ross, what did you bring to the table?

39:41.960 --> 39:46.680
I brought the Sennebogen, the 830E eco version.

39:46.680 --> 39:51.040
Basically, it can rip out trees without angering protesters.

39:52.800 --> 39:55.280
OK, so the rules are pretty simple.

39:55.280 --> 39:56.960
You've got a pile of scrap.

39:56.960 --> 40:00.560
You've got to pick the stuff up and throw it at the shed.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.320
Three turns each.

40:02.320 --> 40:05.800
- Whoever knocks down the most sheds wins.
- Sweet.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.480
OK, you go first.

40:07.480 --> 40:08.880
I'm ready. Go for it.

40:10.880 --> 40:13.360
Ah, going for the washing machine.

40:13.360 --> 40:14.840
Here we go!

40:17.360 --> 40:19.640
Yeah!

40:19.640 --> 40:21.760
I might have overshot a bit.

40:21.760 --> 40:24.040
All right, one down. My turn.

40:24.040 --> 40:26.120
All right, I've got a bathtub now.

40:31.120 --> 40:34.000
Son of a bitch. I missed it.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.360
That was not impressive. OK, your turn.

40:37.360 --> 40:39.840
Ooh, you're going for the jet ski. Nice one.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.560
Let her rip!

40:45.800 --> 40:48.880
- Oh-ho-ho-ho! Beautiful!
- Woohoo!

40:48.880 --> 40:51.480
Beautiful! What are you, three sheds?

40:51.480 --> 40:53.000
Three to nothing. You're winning.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.800
I've got to make up for it here.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.720
It's looking good. It's looking good.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.000
Keep it going. Keep it...

40:59.000 --> 41:00.920
Go round again. Go round again.

41:00.920 --> 41:02.320
One more time. That's it.

41:02.320 --> 41:05.600
Keep going. Keep going. You look like you work at the fair.

41:06.600 --> 41:07.680
Whee!

41:07.680 --> 41:09.880
Scream if you want to go faster! Go!

41:09.880 --> 41:11.400
Yes!

41:11.400 --> 41:13.560
Woohoo!

41:13.560 --> 41:16.000
Got it! MATT LAUGHS

41:16.000 --> 41:18.720
SIREN WAILS Hey, Ross, do you hear that siren?

41:18.720 --> 41:20.880
That must mean it's half-time melons.

41:20.880 --> 41:21.920
Let's have some.

41:23.120 --> 41:24.920
It's a very civilised game.

41:29.080 --> 41:30.640
SIREN WAILS

41:30.640 --> 41:33.440
OK, I guess that means melon time's over.

41:33.440 --> 41:35.280
Right, are we going for the cars?

41:35.280 --> 41:36.400
Definitely.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.320
All right, he's got the scrap Volvo.

41:41.320 --> 41:42.680
Winding it up...

41:42.680 --> 41:43.960
Here we go.

41:43.960 --> 41:46.000
MACHINE HUMS

41:51.640 --> 41:54.360
- Oh!
- Oh, that was a miss.

41:54.360 --> 41:56.040
I'm out of the game. That's me.

41:56.040 --> 41:57.760
It's all down to you now.

41:59.560 --> 42:00.840
I've got you!

42:00.840 --> 42:04.120
Don't make my mistake. Go high. Go high.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.280
OK, I need three sheds to win.

42:11.760 --> 42:14.680
MATT CHUCKLES

42:14.680 --> 42:16.080
That's got to be it.

42:16.080 --> 42:18.000
Yep. You've definitely won.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.320
All right, then, I think...

42:20.640 --> 42:23.720
I think I'm going to have one more go at the car.

42:23.720 --> 42:25.440
I can't get enough.

42:25.440 --> 42:28.720
You can spin your claw... I didn't know you could spin the claw.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.280
Spin it!

42:35.200 --> 42:36.480
Got it!

42:36.480 --> 42:38.000
Yay!

42:39.760 --> 42:45.320
So there you have it - the Terex Fuchs MHL360.

42:45.320 --> 42:46.840
It handles stuff.

42:46.840 --> 42:48.120
It drops stuff.

42:48.120 --> 42:50.920
It crushes stuff really well.

42:53.800 --> 42:55.840
CHEERING

42:57.560 --> 43:00.560
- Come on, how fun was that?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.560
And you... You drive a tractor as well, right?

43:02.560 --> 43:05.920
Yeah, yeah, I drive a tractor, and whilst I think, you know,

43:05.920 --> 43:07.840
you've got a load of digging machinery,

43:07.840 --> 43:11.280
I bought a JCB, and that was a joy, the fact that...

43:11.280 --> 43:12.400
Cos there's not...

43:12.400 --> 43:14.480
I don't know many other people who are...

43:14.480 --> 43:15.800
who are quite into, you know,

43:15.800 --> 43:19.120
that sort of heavy plant machinery just for fun,

43:19.120 --> 43:20.920
but, you know, people do it for a job.

43:20.920 --> 43:22.680
- LAUGHTER I know.
- They do it for a job.

43:22.680 --> 43:24.760
I know, I think we're in the wrong line of work.

43:24.760 --> 43:25.800
Yeah. Oh, it was great.

43:25.800 --> 43:28.480
But just to... Just... Do you ever just, erm...

43:30.880 --> 43:35.920
Do you ever just dig a big hole, just cos you can?

43:35.920 --> 43:37.600
Yes! Yes!

43:37.600 --> 43:40.160
- That's it.
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Is that the best thing ever?

43:40.160 --> 43:42.720
Have you ever gone out and started digging a hole,

43:42.720 --> 43:44.680
and it's got, like, too big...

43:44.680 --> 43:47.120
- Yeah.
- ..and it's got to the point where you're in the hole,

43:47.120 --> 43:49.400
and you go, "Oh, no, I should have just..."

43:49.400 --> 43:51.400
- And you hit water - did you ever do that?
- Oh, yeah.

43:51.400 --> 43:52.600
- There you go. That's...
- Yeah.

43:52.600 --> 43:54.960
"Did I break something? Ooh, let's fill that back in."

43:54.960 --> 43:57.040
- Yeah, but it's fun.
- I can't believe it.

43:57.040 --> 44:00.160
Like, this is the only other man who I've ever met

44:00.160 --> 44:03.280
who has also built a dirt track and also has the heavy machinery.

44:03.280 --> 44:05.440
- It's like...
- You make a lovely couple.
- We do.

44:05.440 --> 44:07.440
- This is the first time...
- We do.
- You know what?

44:07.440 --> 44:10.880
Coming on this show feels like being part of a support group.

44:13.560 --> 44:16.760
OK, I think it's time to see how you did on your timed lap.

44:16.760 --> 44:18.040
How did it go out there?

44:18.040 --> 44:19.080
It was a lot of fun.

44:19.080 --> 44:20.720
It was a lot of fun, but, all day long,

44:20.720 --> 44:22.960
people have just been talking about the Olympians.

44:22.960 --> 44:24.440
You know, Max Whitlock...

44:24.440 --> 44:26.560
They've been talking about Chris Hoy, just saying,

44:26.560 --> 44:28.640
"They're focused. They're machines. They just...

44:28.640 --> 44:31.800
"They're the most focused human beings on the planet."

44:31.800 --> 44:33.000
Erm...

44:33.000 --> 44:37.480
I'm not the most focused human being on the planet, so we'll see.

44:37.480 --> 44:39.880
- But sometimes loose is fast.
- OK.
- You never know.

44:39.880 --> 44:42.960
- All right, let's take a look.
- Let's have a look.

44:42.960 --> 44:45.080
- Here he goes, then.
- TYRES SCREECH

44:45.080 --> 44:46.760
Well, that wasn't the best start.

44:46.760 --> 44:48.200
A bit of a fumble, there.

44:48.200 --> 44:52.120
Nicolas Cage, Gone In 60 Seconds - think about that. Right, OK.

44:52.120 --> 44:53.920
"OK, let's ride!" Oh, no. Hands on the wheel.

44:53.920 --> 44:55.760
Hands on the wheel - that's quite important.

44:55.760 --> 44:59.080
So what's it going to be like into this first corner?

44:59.080 --> 45:00.720
Braking's pretty good.

45:00.720 --> 45:03.040
And the line's pretty good too.

45:03.040 --> 45:04.840
And you've hung on to third gear and, look,

45:04.840 --> 45:07.680
you're using all the circuit, out on to the outside there.

45:07.680 --> 45:08.880
It's impressive.

45:08.880 --> 45:11.320
Braking into Chicago.

45:11.320 --> 45:13.400
What's that? Ooh, and you've hooked second gear,

45:13.400 --> 45:15.600
just locked the back up. Lost a bit of time.

45:15.600 --> 45:17.720
Do it hard, da-ba, da-ba, da-ba!

45:17.720 --> 45:21.560
What was that noise that just came out of my face?

45:21.560 --> 45:25.040
Now down the right-hand side of the back straight.

45:25.040 --> 45:26.400
What can you carry?

45:26.400 --> 45:29.000
Fourth gear, we're going to get a trigger of brake light.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.320
- Yes.
- Oh, madam!

45:32.560 --> 45:35.800
I've no idea what you're saying, but the line's good.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.200
The line is good.

45:37.200 --> 45:38.400
Oh, madam!

45:38.400 --> 45:40.320
Why do I keep saying, "Oh, madam"?

45:43.040 --> 45:44.720
Down to the follow-through.

45:44.720 --> 45:46.760
Oh, a bit mobile at the rear there.

45:46.760 --> 45:48.520
Mobile at the rear and a whoosh.

45:48.520 --> 45:50.480
- Ooh,
- BLEEP,
- shu-hoo-hoo!

45:50.480 --> 45:53.280
That was quite squirrely.

45:53.280 --> 45:55.000
Now this is the trail brake

45:55.000 --> 45:57.520
which you didn't get right last time.

45:57.520 --> 45:58.760
OK.

45:58.760 --> 46:01.720
That was neat and you've used all the circuit too.

46:01.720 --> 46:03.880
Neat is fast, Ross. Neat is fast.

46:03.880 --> 46:05.440
Over the line.

46:05.440 --> 46:07.320
I think that looks quick.

46:07.320 --> 46:10.280
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

46:10.280 --> 46:13.320
All right. Well...

46:13.320 --> 46:15.680
- what do you think?
- Ahh...
- You feeling confident?

46:15.680 --> 46:18.360
I think that it was...

46:18.360 --> 46:22.120
That car, to be fair, that car really does just go

46:22.120 --> 46:24.560
all over the place. And I think looking at that,

46:24.560 --> 46:27.200
the start wasn't particularly good. It was a bit...

46:27.200 --> 46:30.920
So, yeah, I'm... Yeah, I think if I could beat the Doctor,

46:30.920 --> 46:33.200
if I could beat Tennant.

46:33.200 --> 46:36.240
Imagine though, Max... If I got faster than Max Whitlock,

46:36.240 --> 46:38.480
I mean, he's an Olympian.

46:38.480 --> 46:40.560
That's going to crush his world.

46:41.720 --> 46:45.760
He's going to be sat at home just going, "Him, that shabby Geordie?"

46:45.760 --> 46:47.520
OK. Well...

46:47.520 --> 46:49.320
you never know.

46:49.320 --> 46:50.680
Ooh.

46:50.680 --> 46:52.040
Erm...

46:53.840 --> 46:56.680
OK. Ross Noble, you did it

46:56.680 --> 46:58.680
- in one minute...
- Yes!

46:58.680 --> 47:00.800
- ..30...
- Yes!

47:03.640 --> 47:06.440
- ..seven...
- Ooh!
- Oh!

47:06.440 --> 47:09.280
- ..point five. Lovely.
- Yes, yes!

47:11.600 --> 47:13.840
That is a great effort. You should be happy.

47:13.840 --> 47:16.080
He's an Olympian!

47:16.080 --> 47:18.360
Oh, yes!

47:18.360 --> 47:21.080
Ladies and gentlemen, Ross Noble. APPLAUSE

47:21.080 --> 47:23.880
- Well done.
- I've crushed an Olympian's dreams!

47:31.480 --> 47:32.840
Right.

47:32.840 --> 47:36.040
Right, earlier on, Rory and I were exploring Cuba

47:36.040 --> 47:38.080
and its unique motoring culture.

47:38.080 --> 47:40.120
That's right and after our first day on the island,

47:40.120 --> 47:44.080
we managed to find some classic cars and some very passionate drag racers

47:44.080 --> 47:46.840
who had, let's be honest, destroyed us.

47:46.840 --> 47:49.600
Correct, but we weren't done with Cuba yet.

47:52.520 --> 47:55.640
The next morning we continued our Cuban adventure

47:55.640 --> 47:58.840
along the stunning north coast.

47:58.840 --> 48:02.000
It's a new dawn, a new day, my car's running beautifully,

48:02.000 --> 48:05.160
I've got the top down, the sun's rising.

48:05.160 --> 48:06.880
Bring it on!

48:06.880 --> 48:10.080
Having been thrashed once by our new drag racing friends,

48:10.080 --> 48:14.840
we wanted a rematch and had arranged to meet them again that afternoon.

48:14.840 --> 48:17.080
But first we were heading for the capital,

48:17.080 --> 48:21.080
the beating heart of Cuba, to see what motoring curiosities

48:21.080 --> 48:23.320
the legendary city had to offer.

48:25.840 --> 48:27.320
Oh, yes!

48:27.320 --> 48:30.560
This is it. Havana, baby.

48:30.560 --> 48:33.080
A pretty special looking place, look at it.

48:33.080 --> 48:37.560
It's falling down but magnificent at the same time.

48:37.560 --> 48:39.800
'And the cars...

48:39.800 --> 48:42.120
'oh, yeah, they were Cuban.'

48:44.760 --> 48:48.000
Oh, now, this is cool. Tell me this isn't cool.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.360
'Just like the drag race,

48:49.360 --> 48:54.040
'this was another living museum of not quite right Americana.'

48:54.040 --> 48:56.080
Well, that one's a Ford, that black thing.

48:56.080 --> 49:00.440
This thing next to me is a Chevy, that's a Deluxe something.

49:00.440 --> 49:03.520
The problem is they've all been slightly tweaked, haven't they?

49:03.520 --> 49:06.200
So they don't always have the correct headlights

49:06.200 --> 49:09.120
and sort of dressings and features.

49:09.120 --> 49:13.080
The only thing you can be certain of is that they're not new.

49:13.080 --> 49:16.600
OK. This green thing to my left.

49:16.600 --> 49:19.560
- ON RADIO:
- 'I'm guessing a...

49:19.560 --> 49:20.840
'Pontiac.'

49:20.840 --> 49:23.560
Pontiac? Pontiac?

49:23.560 --> 49:26.480
In fact, I think it's an Oldsmobile, I think it's an Oldsmobile.

49:26.480 --> 49:30.680
Ah, he said it is a Pontiac "ocho-ocho".

49:30.680 --> 49:33.040
I don't know, I don't know what that is.

49:39.120 --> 49:42.400
Chris, these guys have just got married.

49:42.400 --> 49:44.600
In years to come, they'll look back and say,

49:44.600 --> 49:45.840
"Do you remember we got married

49:45.840 --> 49:48.680
"and we saw the worst muscle car ever made?"

49:48.680 --> 49:50.200
- Rev, rev, rev!
- CAR REVS

49:50.200 --> 49:51.240
Yeah!

49:51.240 --> 49:54.840
'Undeterred, though, Rory set about winning over Havana.

49:56.480 --> 49:59.000
'And, not being irritating enough already,

49:59.000 --> 50:02.480
'had decided to start calling his car the 'Maro.'

50:02.480 --> 50:05.280
- CAR REVS
- 'Maro!

50:05.280 --> 50:06.440
Chevy.

50:11.800 --> 50:15.520
Hola! I've made some friends, Chris.

50:15.520 --> 50:18.120
He just wanted a closer look at the 'Maro!

50:18.120 --> 50:20.960
Can you stop calling it the 'Maro?

50:20.960 --> 50:24.160
- I'm a tourist attraction.
- That's one word for it.

50:27.560 --> 50:30.800
Honestly, though, Rory could have the limelight

50:30.800 --> 50:34.080
because I'd found what I'd really come to Havana for.

50:36.200 --> 50:40.720
This road I'm driving on is the Malecon,

50:40.720 --> 50:43.360
and that's special because this is the place

50:43.360 --> 50:46.720
where the first two Cuban Grand Prix took place, on this road.

50:46.720 --> 50:49.320
I'm in a Maserati where Maseratis once raced.

50:51.320 --> 50:53.920
This was a rare privilege.

50:53.920 --> 50:57.760
60 years since Fangio won the first Cuban Grand Prix,

50:57.760 --> 51:01.680
over 200,000 fans lining the streets,

51:01.680 --> 51:06.480
it was a time of danger, of glamour, a national obsession.

51:08.000 --> 51:11.360
Cuba had lost its love of racing but now,

51:11.360 --> 51:14.560
through a handful of dedicated racers, it was back.

51:16.920 --> 51:20.640
And as racers, they were very good...

51:20.640 --> 51:21.840
in a straight line.

51:27.640 --> 51:29.720
'It was time for the rematch.'

51:29.720 --> 51:31.440
The boys are back in town.

51:31.440 --> 51:35.760
'And this time we would be racing on our terms.'

51:35.760 --> 51:39.480
OK, guys. You absolutely thrashed us in the drag races,

51:39.480 --> 51:41.160
you owned us completely.

51:41.160 --> 51:42.960
So we played by your rules

51:42.960 --> 51:46.360
and I think it's time that you played by our rules.

51:46.360 --> 51:48.160
We want to introduce...

51:48.160 --> 51:50.520
- corners.
- Oh, no, no.

51:50.520 --> 51:52.360
Have you ever driven around corners before?

51:52.360 --> 51:54.600
No, no, no!

51:54.600 --> 51:57.880
- Ah.
- No, no, no.
- Never.
- Never?

51:57.880 --> 52:00.560
'With the playing field nicely levelled, then,

52:00.560 --> 52:03.000
'I set about preparing the circuit

52:03.000 --> 52:07.320
'while Chris gave the competition a bit of cornering 101.'

52:08.520 --> 52:10.360
The anatomy of the corner.

52:10.360 --> 52:12.960
Entry...

52:12.960 --> 52:14.720
clip...

52:14.720 --> 52:16.720
then the exit.

52:21.400 --> 52:23.200
Arghhh!

52:27.280 --> 52:29.400
We turn, get on the power.

52:29.400 --> 52:31.040
- Whoa.
- Whoopa!

52:31.040 --> 52:33.040
- And then we get the exit.
- OK!

52:45.720 --> 52:48.160
So, do you understand corners now? Good?

52:48.160 --> 52:50.200
- Bueno?
- HE SPEAKS IN SPANISH

52:52.960 --> 52:55.520
- That was easy.
- You've passed your test.

52:59.960 --> 53:01.520
Do you know what, mate?

53:01.520 --> 53:04.440
This might not be the most hi-tech set-up

53:04.440 --> 53:06.920
but, in our own messy little way,

53:06.920 --> 53:09.160
we're about to make a bit of history here.

53:09.160 --> 53:13.000
'Yes, with a few scattered tyres making up an oval track,

53:13.000 --> 53:15.160
'complete with chicane,

53:15.160 --> 53:19.720
'we were about to throw the first circuit race in Cuba for 57 years.

53:21.200 --> 53:24.600
'Naturally, qualification for this historic event would be decided

53:24.600 --> 53:25.960
'by the highly technical...

53:27.280 --> 53:28.880
'..drawing of straws.'

53:29.840 --> 53:31.760
Four.

53:31.760 --> 53:33.240
Seven.

53:33.240 --> 53:35.680
LAUGHTER

53:35.680 --> 53:38.080
- It's a stitch up, isn't it?
- Good luck.

53:41.920 --> 53:45.280
Taking our places on the grid, then,

53:45.280 --> 53:50.120
fourth Cuban Grand Prix would be contested over as many laps.

53:50.120 --> 53:52.800
And starting from seventh place,

53:52.800 --> 53:56.080
if I was going to prove the Maserati's racing pedigree,

53:56.080 --> 53:58.680
I would have to come from the back of the pack.

54:00.880 --> 54:04.520
Dear Lord, that Ford was making some noise then.

54:04.520 --> 54:07.280
He also has a pair of testicles dangling down

54:07.280 --> 54:08.880
from the back of his car.

54:11.760 --> 54:16.360
Fangio, Moss, Reid,

54:16.360 --> 54:17.960
got quite a nice ring to it.

54:22.520 --> 54:24.440
This is just so cool.

54:24.440 --> 54:25.920
Come on, baby.

54:32.560 --> 54:35.120
I've passed one. I've passed one.

54:39.320 --> 54:41.880
There's the big Ford, get up the inside of him.

54:44.560 --> 54:47.080
He's quite quick.

54:47.080 --> 54:48.800
Up the inside?

54:48.800 --> 54:50.240
Yeah, why not?

54:50.240 --> 54:54.200
'After one lap, Chris had already climbed up to fourth.

54:54.200 --> 54:58.600
'The Maserati was on a mission but I was still ahead in third.'

54:58.600 --> 55:00.360
OK!

55:00.360 --> 55:02.160
Two Cubans in front of me.

55:02.160 --> 55:04.560
RORY LAUGHS

55:04.560 --> 55:07.920
Stay with them, 'Maro, stay with them. Stay with them, baby, come on.

55:07.920 --> 55:10.280
Oh, they're quick in a straight line!

55:10.280 --> 55:11.680
Oh, my goodness.

55:11.680 --> 55:15.160
'While Rory focused on the cars in front, though...'

55:15.160 --> 55:18.280
I've got Reid in front of me now.

55:18.280 --> 55:20.320
Oh, Harris is right behind me!

55:24.840 --> 55:26.560
Not sure I can do him here.

55:27.680 --> 55:29.560
Oh, Harris is right up my inside!

55:31.000 --> 55:33.120
No!

55:33.120 --> 55:34.400
Oh, he's got me!

55:35.760 --> 55:37.280
There we go, Reid.

55:38.680 --> 55:40.320
Damn you, Harris!

55:44.840 --> 55:46.440
My knob's come off!

55:47.480 --> 55:49.680
Rory Reid's under pressure.

55:53.560 --> 55:55.160
'Going into the last lap,

55:55.160 --> 55:58.440
'Chris had just the two fastest Cubans in front.'

55:59.560 --> 56:01.360
Right, let's catch the locals.

56:06.560 --> 56:09.360
I've got one. I've done one, I've done one.

56:09.360 --> 56:10.600
I've done one.

56:14.720 --> 56:18.080
'And there was only one thing he had come for...

56:18.080 --> 56:20.320
'to give his Maserati the win.'

56:22.880 --> 56:25.840
Come on! Yeah, Maserati leads again!

56:25.840 --> 56:27.520
Nice work, nice!

56:30.840 --> 56:32.320
RORY LAUGHS

56:34.960 --> 56:37.560
Once again, a Maserati leads in Cuba!

56:42.480 --> 56:45.600
Oh, history, it's history.

56:48.760 --> 56:51.560
'A tiny piece of history, perhaps,

56:51.560 --> 56:56.280
'but this small collection of cars on this ragged assembly of corners

56:56.280 --> 56:59.800
'had achieved something not seen for a generation.'

56:59.800 --> 57:01.600
- Well done.
- Well done.

57:01.600 --> 57:04.040
Oh, my God. Well done, well done.

57:04.040 --> 57:06.520
- Well done, man.
- Fantastic.

57:06.520 --> 57:08.280
Well done, man. Well done.

57:09.600 --> 57:11.520
'Cuba had raced...'

57:11.520 --> 57:14.120
Fantastic. Thank you, guys. Thank you.

57:14.120 --> 57:16.680
'..and we had been there.

57:16.680 --> 57:20.840
'And while it didn't look like much, it felt special.'

57:22.360 --> 57:24.680
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Yeah!

57:24.680 --> 57:27.240
- That was great. That was great.
- Amazing.

57:27.240 --> 57:31.560
Also, can we please just say a huge thank you to the people of Cuba?

57:31.560 --> 57:34.640
- Yep.
- Great sports.
- Mm-hm.
- And good drivers too.
- Yeah.

57:34.640 --> 57:36.840
OK, so, let me get this straight now,

57:36.840 --> 57:41.160
you had a race around corners on a course that you designed,

57:41.160 --> 57:45.000
against a bunch of locals who've never raced around corners.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.360
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

57:46.360 --> 57:48.480
And they were driving cars from the 1950s

57:48.480 --> 57:52.520
and you beat them in your much newer Italian sports car.

57:52.520 --> 57:54.760
- Correct.
- Yeah, and then you celebrated

57:54.760 --> 57:57.160
as if you'd just won the Monaco Grand Prix.

57:58.560 --> 58:00.480
- Yes.
- Yeah.

58:00.480 --> 58:02.720
How do you feel about yourself?

58:02.720 --> 58:04.160
- Not so great now.
- Yeah.

58:04.160 --> 58:06.600
Do you think you could have at least left the cars there

58:06.600 --> 58:08.680
- for the Cubans?
- Well...
- Matt, I wanted to, honestly.

58:08.680 --> 58:10.000
I was trying to tell him, anyway,

58:10.000 --> 58:12.200
but it turned out the government would've charged them

58:12.200 --> 58:13.800
like 20 grand in import duty

58:13.800 --> 58:16.280
and it didn't quite seem the right thing to do,

58:16.280 --> 58:19.760
- no matter how great the 'Maro is.
- What? Stop, Rory. Please stop.

58:19.760 --> 58:21.800
It's not called a 'Maro.

58:21.800 --> 58:23.880
Listen, Matt, you're American, tell him.

58:23.880 --> 58:26.600
Yeah, yeah, he's right, I am American and no one...

58:26.600 --> 58:30.000
No one calls it a 'Maro, OK?

58:30.000 --> 58:31.560
All right, next week's show,

58:31.560 --> 58:34.480
I drive an eight-wheeled Russian thing.

58:34.480 --> 58:36.200
I drive the new Porsche Cayman.

58:36.200 --> 58:39.800
And we turn the world's ugliest car into a luxury yacht.

58:39.800 --> 58:40.920
We'll see you then.

58:40.920 --> 58:42.240
ALL: Goodnight!
