00:30.197 --> 00:32.165
One silk handkerchief.

00:33.801 --> 00:34.790
One necktie.

00:37.338 --> 00:38.600
One watch.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.371
One ring.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.510
One gold money clip with no money in it.

00:54.021 --> 00:56.148
And one mobile phone.

01:05.766 --> 01:08.792
Fifty cents a day,
minus what you spent inside,

01:08.903 --> 01:10.700
and a train ticket to the Big Apple.

01:10.805 --> 01:13.399
Good luck, Gekko, and don't come back.

01:14.408 --> 01:17.673
<i>You want to know
what the mother of all bubbles was?</i>

01:18.279 --> 01:21.009
<i>It came out of nowhere.
By chance.</i>

01:21.115 --> 01:22.742
- How many you got, Mac?
- Five.

01:22.850 --> 01:25.478
<i>They called it the Cambrian Explosion.</i>

01:25.586 --> 01:27.986
<i>It happened around 530 million years ago.</i>

01:28.089 --> 01:29.056
Open the gate!

01:29.156 --> 01:33.616
<i>And over the next 70, 80 million years,
the rate of evolution accelerated so fast</i>

01:34.628 --> 01:36.323
<i>that we came along.</i>

01:36.797 --> 01:38.321
<i>The human race.</i>

01:39.767 --> 01:43.897
<i>They still can't explain how that happened,
except that it happened.</i>

01:44.472 --> 01:45.496
Here he is!

01:57.952 --> 01:58.919
Daddy!

02:12.700 --> 02:15.066
<i>Some people say it was by chance,</i>

02:16.270 --> 02:17.760
<i>others, design.</i>

02:19.840 --> 02:21.603
<i>But who really knows?</i>

02:34.221 --> 02:39.818
<i>The dimming of the light
makes the picture clearer</i>

02:40.528 --> 02:43.929
<i>It's just an old photograph</i>

02:44.031 --> 02:47.467
<i>There's nothing to hide</i>

02:47.635 --> 02:53.505
<i>When the world was just beginning</i>

02:56.677 --> 03:02.547
<i>I memorized a face
so it's not forgotten</i>

03:02.983 --> 03:06.350
<i>I hear the wind whistlin'</i>

03:06.453 --> 03:10.549
<i>Come back anytime</i>

03:10.658 --> 03:15.891
<i>And we'll mix our lives together</i>

03:18.833 --> 03:21.461
<i>Heaven knows</i>

03:21.569 --> 03:28.133
<i>What keeps mankind alive</i>

03:30.044 --> 03:33.036
<i>Connecting</i>

03:33.147 --> 03:37.607
<i>To places we have known</i>

03:40.221 --> 03:43.520
<i>I'm looking for a home</i>

03:43.624 --> 03:47.390
<i>Where the wheels are turning</i>

03:47.494 --> 03:53.023
<i>Home
Why I keep returning</i>

03:53.133 --> 03:58.366
<i>Home
With our bodies touching</i>

03:58.806 --> 04:04.073
<i>Home
And the cameras watching</i>

04:04.378 --> 04:06.039
<i>Home</i>

04:06.146 --> 04:11.083
<i>Will infect whatever you do</i>

04:14.788 --> 04:17.620
<i>We're home</i>

04:17.725 --> 04:21.889
<i>Comes to life from out of the blue</i>

04:29.403 --> 04:30.768
Stop sleeping.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.566
You mean "wake up."

04:32.673 --> 04:36.006
"Wake up" is positive.
"Stop sleeping" is a negative.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.511
Either way,
it's not my favorite part of the day.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.808
It's the best part of the day.

04:42.182 --> 04:46.482
I feel bad for anybody who feels that way.
It means their day can't get any better.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.914
You go to bed too late.
You don't sleep enough.

04:54.261 --> 04:56.525
What's going on with you today?

04:57.264 --> 04:58.754
Did I tell you, or did you forget?

04:59.533 --> 05:01.763
I'm going to Washington for the week.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.063
Yeah. New site, right?

05:03.637 --> 05:04.797
We're launching in 10 days,

05:04.905 --> 05:06.532
so the whole site's down
starting tomorrow.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.438
What are all those angry liberals
going to do without their daily fix, baby?

05:09.576 --> 05:12.875
You're just as liberal as they are,
Mr. Green Energy.

05:13.013 --> 05:15.675
No, no, no.
The only green is money, honey.

05:15.783 --> 05:18.581
You're so Wall Street, it makes me sick.

05:18.919 --> 05:22.218
- Baby, come here.
- No. What did I ever see in you?

05:22.323 --> 05:23.449
- Come here.
- No.

05:23.557 --> 05:24.990
<i>My next guest, Gordon Gekko,</i>

05:25.092 --> 05:27.526
<i>was one of the biggest names
on Wall Street in the '80s</i>

05:27.628 --> 05:31.155
<i>before he went to prison
for insider trading and securities fraud.</i>

05:31.265 --> 05:34.063
<i>He's out with a new book,
and it is a shocker, believe me.</i>

05:34.168 --> 05:36.363
<i>It is called</i> Is Greed Good?

05:36.470 --> 05:39.337
<i>The man himself is here with us.
Gordon, good to have you on the program.</i>

05:39.440 --> 05:40.998
<i>Thank you, Maria.
It's nice to be out.</i>

05:41.108 --> 05:42.632
- Turn it off.
- One sec.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.074
<i>And I must tell you,
your show is a big, big hit in the can.</i>

05:45.446 --> 05:48.347
<i>Oh. You watched it in prison?</i>

05:48.449 --> 05:49.438
<i>Your show?</i>

05:50.184 --> 05:52.311
<i>Me and a whole lot of others.</i>

05:52.886 --> 05:54.581
<i>You wrote the book in prison?</i>

05:54.688 --> 05:56.918
<i>I did. I outlined my drafts...</i>

06:00.094 --> 06:01.823
I'm taking a shower.

06:09.503 --> 06:15.135
<i>Everybody says that the living is easy</i>

06:15.242 --> 06:19.872
<i>I can barely see
'Cause my head's in the way</i>

06:20.881 --> 06:23.577
<i>Tigers walk behind me</i>

06:24.018 --> 06:27.215
<i>They are to remind me that</i>

06:27.521 --> 06:32.322
<i>I'm lost, but I'm not afraid</i>

06:32.459 --> 06:34.825
<i>Soul to soul</i>

06:34.928 --> 06:37.829
<i>A kiss and a sigh</i>

06:37.931 --> 06:39.865
<i>Sawed in half...</i>

06:39.967 --> 06:41.594
See you next week.

06:42.369 --> 06:43.768
Good luck in Washington.

06:49.643 --> 06:55.206
<i>People on the outside
I remember sweet times</i>

06:55.682 --> 07:00.085
<i>This old rose is always in bloom</i>

07:03.490 --> 07:04.980
- Hello?
- <i>Jacob.</i>

07:05.092 --> 07:06.059
Dr. Masters.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.151
<i>Good morning, sir.
Don't you get any sleep?</i>

07:08.262 --> 07:12.028
Jacob, it happened.
As close as we've come to burn yet.

07:12.166 --> 07:13.565
<i>Really? How many lasers?</i>

07:13.667 --> 07:17.660
We fired 72 this morning,
and we're going to go for 96 next week.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.501
That's fantastic.
That's a game changer, Doc.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.735
So let me guess, it means we're pushing
the pace, right? You need more money?

07:23.844 --> 07:27.075
Well, it'd be good
if we could get another $100 million.

07:27.181 --> 07:30.412
We could pick up
maybe six months on our schedule.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.241
A hundred million dollars?

07:32.786 --> 07:35.448
As long as the price of oil stays high,
we'll get the money.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.319
That would be nice.
That would be nice.

07:37.524 --> 07:41.187
Because The Foundation says that they're
having some problems in the markets...

07:41.295 --> 07:43.263
You don't worry about that, though,
okay, Doc?

07:43.363 --> 07:46.127
You just keep building
that baby star, okay?

07:46.233 --> 07:49.828
<i>Okay. Thank you, Jacob.
Thank you.</i>

07:49.937 --> 07:52.098
All right, I'll talk to you soon.

07:52.239 --> 07:57.609
<i>Now I can say
Those three little words</i>

07:57.711 --> 08:02.774
<i>And everyday I'm dreaming a world</i>

08:03.884 --> 08:06.318
<i>Life is long</i>

08:06.420 --> 08:08.980
<i>If you give it way</i>

08:09.089 --> 08:12.024
<i>So stay, don't go</i>

08:12.126 --> 08:15.186
<i>'Cause I'm fading away</i>

08:15.395 --> 08:20.856
<i>Soul to soul
Between you and me</i>

08:20.968 --> 08:26.338
<i>Chain me down
But I am still free</i>

08:30.711 --> 08:32.837
Hydra Offshore.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.506
Let me repeat this again.

08:35.616 --> 08:39.552
A huge deep-sea exploration
play off the coast of Equatorial Guinea.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.847
That's an oil field
that's barely been touched.

08:41.955 --> 08:46.790
Remember, the stock's trading
roughly 31% off the 52-week high

08:46.894 --> 08:50.591
and it's part owned and funded
by none other than, guess who.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.126
Churchill Schwartz.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.700
So we know they won't let
anything too bad happen here.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.962
My suggestion is that we get aggressive.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.560
- Agreed?
- Yeah.

08:59.673 --> 09:00.901
We all agree?

09:01.275 --> 09:03.266
Ed, what do you think?

09:03.377 --> 09:05.311
I don't agree. Maybe it's just me.

09:05.412 --> 09:07.812
Equatorial Guinea's
a pretty tough dictatorship.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.746
This guy's already nationalized
the gold and diamond mines.

09:09.850 --> 09:10.839
So what's your point?

09:10.951 --> 09:11.975
I just don't think it's a risk our desk

09:12.085 --> 09:13.985
should be taking right now, that's all.
I'd wait.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.247
- Wait? Wait for what?
- Yeah.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.982
Your "Beam me up, Scottie"
hydrogen fusion deal?

09:17.090 --> 09:19.820
Now you're talking about something else.
It's United Fusion Corporation, Stan.

09:19.927 --> 09:20.985
Come on. It's apples and oranges.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.118
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

09:22.262 --> 09:25.925
You mean the deal that we already sank
$50 million into, Mr. Brainiac?

09:26.033 --> 09:29.298
Alternative energy is what
biotech was 15 years ago, Stan.

09:29.603 --> 09:30.797
Come on. You were young once.
You know that.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.735
Profits aren't quarterly.
The runs could be huge.

09:32.839 --> 09:35.603
We'll all be dead by the time
your nutty professor makes us any money.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.644
Right, this coming from the guy
who said Google was a bubble.

09:40.581 --> 09:43.982
Anyway. Hydra Offshore.

09:44.117 --> 09:47.883
It's priced right for us to make
three to five times on our money.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.252
And better yet,
what we all love the most.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.153
Big year-end bonuses.

09:55.829 --> 09:58.024
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's make some dough!

09:58.131 --> 09:59.189
What's up? You good?

10:11.712 --> 10:14.010
I can't! It's not up to me.

10:14.114 --> 10:18.278
Maybe I can do it, maybe I can't do it.
People are telling me something.

10:18.418 --> 10:21.148
Jesus! Harry, you gave me your word.

10:21.255 --> 10:22.847
You know I know!

10:24.925 --> 10:26.153
You okay, Lou?

10:27.794 --> 10:31.753
Good day, I'm okay. Bad day, I'm okay.
What's the difference?

10:33.367 --> 10:35.494
Do me a favor.
Don't ask me dumb questions.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.130
You wanted to see me?

10:37.237 --> 10:39.000
Steve, stay on top of Harry, okay?

10:39.106 --> 10:41.438
- He's driving me crazy.
- You got it, boss.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.000
Follow me.

10:50.651 --> 10:51.709
Why?

10:51.818 --> 10:54.150
That's some "Thank you."
What do you want, a kiss, too?

10:54.254 --> 10:56.688
I thought maybe the news out of London
would've wrecked the mood.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.917
London? Don't tell me London.

10:59.026 --> 11:03.463
I take a look at their sheets. They tell me
they got a $125 million profit, right?

11:03.563 --> 11:05.224
I look at the same lousy spread,

11:05.332 --> 11:07.061
to me it looks like
a buck and a quarter loss.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.728
Then they tell me, "Don't worry about it.
We're making money on the losses."

11:10.837 --> 11:13.806
How do you make money on losses?
You tell me.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.832
I'm just an old dinosaur.

11:15.942 --> 11:17.967
Lou, I believe in Keller Zabel.
We're fine.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.238
And you're not a dinosaur.
Come on.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.677
It's no fun anymore, Jacob.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.612
I'm talking to some guy
in Mumbai, Dumbai.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.447
I don't know what he's talking about.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.487
I don't know what he's selling,
I don't know who he is,

11:28.588 --> 11:29.987
I don't know how much I'm putting up.

11:30.090 --> 11:33.423
And my partners, they're in their graves.
They're laughing at me.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.354
It's just a bunch of machines now,
telling us what to do.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.829
That's why you got people like me here,
Lou, to lighten the load.

11:39.499 --> 11:42.434
Getting old is not for sissies, kid.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.873
Take that money, huh?

11:49.976 --> 11:52.570
You spend it on that pretty girl.
You deserve it.

11:54.948 --> 11:57.212
I remember when the pro sent me you.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.945
This skinny kid with crazy hair.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.954
I said, "Jimmy, what are you doing to me?
Give me a real caddy."

12:03.557 --> 12:06.685
I was having a bad day,
and you wouldn't shut up.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.761
Twelve years old,
you're talking to me about

12:08.862 --> 12:12.923
companies and sectors and earnings.

12:16.503 --> 12:20.940
You had the hunger, Jake.
I could smell it then. You still got it.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.304
I've just never had a check like this
in my hands before.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.745
You spend it. Somebody has to keep
our economy going.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.375
Well, get out of my office.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.394
Thank you.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.331
Princess cut.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.973
Platinum-banded, one and a half carat.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.901
There's nothing quite like a ring...

12:58.011 --> 13:02.345
Can you take me to the money room?

13:03.784 --> 13:07.515
You mean the private client foyer?

13:08.255 --> 13:09.483
That's it.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.852
Olga from Russia, with love.

13:45.425 --> 13:46.619
How are you?

13:47.093 --> 13:49.755
Shots or champagne, guys?

14:05.278 --> 14:10.079
She was scoping you for the kill, bro.
Perfect. An 11, man. Gisele time.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.707
No. This is...

14:16.089 --> 14:18.614
Wow. You're serious.

14:18.825 --> 14:19.792
Yeah.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.721
So young, and already pricing yourself
off the market.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.588
- 'Tron?
- Shots.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.199
So when are you gonna ask her?

14:31.304 --> 14:33.169
She's not that crazy
about marriage, you know.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.240
I mean, look at her parents.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.707
A girl's got to get it straight
with her pop, don't you think?

14:36.810 --> 14:39.210
- What if you have kids?
- Yeah, it's going be tough.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.870
Did you hear what he said on TV
the other night?

14:41.448 --> 14:45.009
"Home loan defaults are just the first
raindrop in the mother of all storms."

14:45.185 --> 14:47.847
Christ. Sour grapes, this man.

14:47.954 --> 14:50.514
The guy is a legend.
Gordon the Gekko.

14:50.891 --> 14:53.689
He's speaking next week
up at your old alma mater, Fordham.

14:53.960 --> 14:54.927
Watch yourself.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.586
- Hey buddy, get a cane.
- Come on, come on.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.692
A few of us are going up after work
to check him out. Come along.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.562
I can't. Winnie, you know.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.167
The only God you worship is Zabel.

15:04.271 --> 15:07.104
I don't worship the man.
He got me a seat at the table.

15:07.207 --> 15:10.574
The word is he's stuck with a ton of toxic
sub-prime debt off the balance sheet.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.577
Billions. Can't find a bid for it.

15:12.679 --> 15:13.839
Yeah, so what?

15:14.281 --> 15:16.749
So, buddy, it don't matter
if the rumors are true or not.

15:16.850 --> 15:18.943
Because in this climate,
it's what buyers believe.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.519
And where there's smoke, there's fire.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.515
- I'll make you a bet right now.
- Go.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.487
I got a million dollars left
of my bonus, okay?

15:24.591 --> 15:26.923
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's yours tomorrow a.m.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.222
You put it in KZI shares.
You leverage that to the max.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.421
That's how much I believe
in this company.

15:30.530 --> 15:31.861
Did you not hear me?

15:31.965 --> 15:33.694
Listen, as your only friend left

15:33.800 --> 15:36.860
from a place in Long Island no one
can remember, let alone pronounce,

15:36.970 --> 15:39.234
I'm telling you,
you're acting like your mama.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.499
Don't do that.
Leave her out of this.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.339
Plus, why would he spot-bonus me
right now if we were in trouble, huh?

15:45.445 --> 15:46.434
It makes no sense.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.741
Look, you don't want to make
any money on this, fine.

15:48.848 --> 15:51.146
- I'm sure Harry Shapiro would love to.
- Okay, okay.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.310
I'm a hooker, too.
Send it to me.

15:53.420 --> 15:54.819
You're still young enough to recover.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.089
I'll ream you on the commission.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.681
I'm gonna love the look on your face

15:59.793 --> 16:01.260
when I make so much money off this.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.022
I'll have no choice but to walk away.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.427
<i>Guys, we're looking
at an unprecedented meltdown here.</i>

16:09.536 --> 16:11.003
<i>I've never seen anything like it...</i>

16:11.438 --> 16:14.271
<i>Keller Zabel's loss today
was the worst in over a year.</i>

16:14.374 --> 16:16.672
<i>And this big drop may be
just the beginning</i>

16:16.776 --> 16:18.869
<i>of a much deeper correction.</i>

16:19.212 --> 16:22.739
<i>It is an amazing story.
Keller Zabel stock is getting hammered.</i>

16:22.849 --> 16:24.680
<i>How is it you've never been
more wrong in your life</i>

16:24.784 --> 16:25.808
<i>than right now?</i>

16:25.919 --> 16:28.114
<i>You're losing all your money right now.
I see it, it's going down.</i>

16:28.221 --> 16:31.554
<i>Somebody is betting big money
that Zabel's stock is about to collapse.</i>

16:31.658 --> 16:32.647
<i>You wanna owe?</i>

16:32.859 --> 16:34.724
This stock's about to lose
its bar mitzvah, Jake.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.729
Take the haircut and sell.
You're on a 50% margin, buddy.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.959
I can still get you out now at a total loss,
but at least you won't owe.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.824
<i>...threatening the firm 's liquidity.</i>

16:42.936 --> 16:47.669
<i>In one incredible week,
shares of KZI are down 52%.</i>

16:47.874 --> 16:49.865
I know where the stock is.
I have it in front of me.

16:49.976 --> 16:52.001
What you got to do right now is relax,
take a deep breath.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.977
Tell your banks not to sell the stock.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.241
The stock is overreacting right now and...

16:56.349 --> 16:57.748
Hey, what financial stock isn't, right?

16:57.851 --> 17:00.251
Listen, three months from now
we're going to look back on this and laugh.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.479
You're angry? I'm angry.

17:01.588 --> 17:02.646
Okay! We're okay.

17:02.756 --> 17:03.984
- Relax.
- Relax.

17:05.558 --> 17:06.650
Jesus Christ.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.560
<i>I've known you
your whole life, Jake.</i>

17:09.128 --> 17:10.756
And I know when you're lying to yourself.

17:10.896 --> 17:14.765
Robby, listen to me. Keller Zabel's 
been around a long, long time.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.598
All right? It's one of the great names
in investment banking.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.798
A month, a year, it doesn't matter.
We'll be back to 65/70, and I'll be fine.

17:20.906 --> 17:22.374
You just gotta hold it, okay?

17:22.709 --> 17:24.199
You're gonna owe, you know.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.778
Not just the buck, but the margin, too.
We're talking another...

17:26.880 --> 17:28.074
Tell me.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.879
You don't want to hear this today.

17:30.984 --> 17:32.212
Robby.

17:32.686 --> 17:33.653
How much?

17:33.753 --> 17:35.050
<i>At least another half a buck.</i>

17:36.656 --> 17:38.954
<i>Give me the okay to sell, buddy.</i>

17:40.360 --> 17:41.657
<i>Right now.</i>

17:42.395 --> 17:44.955
<i>Sell. Sell!</i>

17:45.532 --> 17:47.500
Robby, I got to call you later.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.663
Have you seen Zabel?

17:58.778 --> 18:00.370
Annica, where's Lou?

18:00.480 --> 18:03.347
Not in. Not answering.

18:04.851 --> 18:05.977
Not happy.

18:12.959 --> 18:13.926
Hey.

18:15.328 --> 18:16.352
Lou.

18:20.366 --> 18:22.698
Hey, Lou.
How's your day going, huh?

18:22.836 --> 18:27.034
I told you. Good day, I'm okay.
Bad day, I'm okay.

18:27.140 --> 18:30.109
Stop bugging me on my feelings.
They're irrelevant.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.409
I wanted to come see you face to face
and talk about these rumors, you know.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.072
Because it's getting crazy.
It's out of control now.

18:36.182 --> 18:37.342
I'm hearing it from all ends.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.439
Our world is all bullshit.

18:39.719 --> 18:43.416
Some TV bubblehead, he gets up there
like he knows something.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.053
He sells fear, panic.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.454
And morons, they love it.

18:48.561 --> 18:51.223
They want it to end because it sells.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.458
There's no limits anymore.

18:53.867 --> 18:57.325
Muriel knows how to walk this thing.
It's her damn dog.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.405
Lou, I can help.
I can get to the bottom of these derivatives.

18:59.506 --> 19:00.905
You just got to tell me.

19:01.007 --> 19:02.497
There's so much you don't know, Jacob.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.339
What? What about the bonus thing?
Why now?

19:05.645 --> 19:09.411
Because I know you.
You're holding out for something better.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.950
Well, don't. Spend it.
Use the money.

19:13.052 --> 19:15.020
Because one day, you're gonna wake up
and you're gonna be dead.

19:15.121 --> 19:16.782
Lou, you got to get yourself together,
all right?

19:16.890 --> 19:18.084
We're gonna be fine.

19:18.191 --> 19:21.024
No matter how bad this thing gets,
we have real equity in this company.

19:21.127 --> 19:22.287
We're gonna get through this.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.862
Marry Gekko's daughter.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.897
Make some kids with her.

19:26.299 --> 19:29.063
And you spend as much time as you can
with those kids when they're young

19:29.169 --> 19:31.194
because everything changes.
Everything.

19:31.304 --> 19:34.239
I cannot help you if I don't understand
what you are talking about.

19:34.340 --> 19:37.070
There's 15,000 jobs on the line right now.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.407
Somebody's after us, right?
Somebody's trying to hurt us.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.743
There's a reason this is happening.
I need to know how and why.

19:42.849 --> 19:46.148
You know that dream you got about
that little energy company in California?

19:46.252 --> 19:49.380
You may not get there,
but you hold on to that.

19:49.489 --> 19:50.956
Because everything else is just noise.

19:51.057 --> 19:53.855
It's not just noise.
There's 15,000 jobs on the line.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.554
Fifteen thousand people here.
That's not noise.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.756
- Are we going under?
- I never liked this damn dog.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.823
Louis, are we going under?

20:03.937 --> 20:05.666
You're asking the wrong question, Jacob.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.330
What's the right question?

20:08.107 --> 20:09.074
Who isn't?

20:40.573 --> 20:41.972
China's out.

20:42.709 --> 20:43.801
You said...

20:43.910 --> 20:45.878
I know what I said, Bill.

20:46.713 --> 20:49.409
Two months we negotiated
with these pikers.

20:49.515 --> 20:50.777
They pulled out at 7:00 p.m.

20:50.884 --> 20:53.614
So what's new? They're Chinese.

20:53.786 --> 20:56.653
And while they were negotiating,
we lost the Koreans.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.451
So you're saying
you don't have an out.

20:58.558 --> 21:02.050
No, I'm saying, just give me one week.

21:02.896 --> 21:06.093
We're still talking to the British.
And the Arabs are back in,

21:06.199 --> 21:08.133
and this time it's for real.

21:08.234 --> 21:10.327
<i>Lou, we've heard this before.</i>

21:10.436 --> 21:14.338
Jesus. Paul, we lost billions this week.

21:14.974 --> 21:18.842
If the markets don't roll over our paper
Sunday night, before Asia opens,

21:18.945 --> 21:21.778
Keller Zabel cannot do business on Monday.

21:22.448 --> 21:25.713
Tuesday, 15,000 people are gonna be
out of a job, worldwide!

21:25.818 --> 21:29.549
Lou, you understated
the scale of your bad loans.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.988
Your valuations are no longer believable.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.461
After all these years,

21:37.797 --> 21:39.230
you say this to me?

21:40.133 --> 21:41.259
Me?

21:42.969 --> 21:46.200
Three-quarters of the banking houses
at this table

21:46.306 --> 21:50.037
are holding the same paper,
and you're gonna let Keller Zabel fail?

21:53.112 --> 21:55.342
You're all committing suicide.

21:59.319 --> 22:01.981
What do you say, Harry?
Will you come in on this?

22:02.088 --> 22:04.886
Look, if you want us
to bail out Keller Zabel,

22:04.991 --> 22:06.618
all of us will have to participate.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.860
Like Long-Term Capital, '98.

22:08.962 --> 22:12.227
And we will need substantial guarantees
from the US Treasury.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.335
Bill, I think we should talk privately.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.601
<i>I think that's a good idea, Bill.</i>

22:19.706 --> 22:21.469
Gentlemen, give us a minute.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.869
What about moral hazard, Jack?

22:24.744 --> 22:29.238
We bail out Keller Zabel, who's to say
it's not gonna happen again and again?

22:31.751 --> 22:34.219
You vindictive bastard.

22:35.755 --> 22:38.781
Who are you to talk about moral hazard?

22:38.891 --> 22:39.880
I'm sorry, Lou.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.356
The Street needs to make a statement
here to the world.

22:42.462 --> 22:43.986
It was eight years ago!

22:44.197 --> 22:46.791
You just can't let it go,
can you, Bretton?

22:46.899 --> 22:48.833
All right, Lou, knock it off!

22:53.339 --> 22:56.137
I'd like to speak with you, Bill. Jack.

22:57.744 --> 22:59.109
And Lou.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.237
Separately.

23:03.116 --> 23:04.174
Thirty of our people

23:04.283 --> 23:06.774
have been through the Keller Zabel books
for the last three days.

23:06.886 --> 23:10.185
And they still say it's impossible
to get to the bottom of this.

23:10.490 --> 23:13.391
This could be a 10-billion dollar hole for us.

23:13.493 --> 23:17.759
Or it could be a 200-billion dollar hole
and there's no way we can risk that money

23:17.864 --> 23:19.991
without a backstop
from Treasury or the Fed.

23:20.099 --> 23:22.158
You started this, didn't you, Bretton?

23:22.268 --> 23:25.362
I said knock it off, Lou.
Or this meeting is over, you hear me?

23:26.439 --> 23:28.566
You're asking us
to take a large risk here, Bretton.

23:28.708 --> 23:29.697
What are you offering?

23:30.076 --> 23:33.273
Under these conditions, and assuming

23:35.248 --> 23:37.443
you refine your guarantee,

23:37.550 --> 23:40.747
Jack, Julie and I, and our partners
who have been consulted,

23:42.889 --> 23:45.050
are prepared to risk $2 a share.

23:47.393 --> 23:48.655
Two bucks?

23:49.495 --> 23:52.658
Jesus. You're out of your mind.

23:53.232 --> 23:56.929
The stock was trading at 79 a month ago!

23:57.270 --> 24:00.762
Our building alone is worth more
than two bucks a share.

24:01.340 --> 24:02.307
Julie.

24:02.408 --> 24:05.741
If only we had more time, Lou.

24:05.845 --> 24:06.937
My board will never accept this.

24:07.313 --> 24:10.077
There is no way I'm gonna sell
for two bucks a share.

24:10.183 --> 24:12.811
The government,
if we guarantee this deal,

24:12.919 --> 24:15.149
could never justify a high price
for your company.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.320
And if you don't sell, Lou,
you're in bankruptcy.

24:17.423 --> 24:19.914
This is a public spectacle now.

24:20.026 --> 24:24.019
No, it's a public execution,
and you'll be leading it, Bill.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.427
I built this company.

24:25.531 --> 24:27.624
And your exit will help
restore faith in it.

24:27.733 --> 24:29.963
Who the hell are you
to tell me to get out?

24:30.069 --> 24:32.537
You're out, Lou!
One way or the other, you're out.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.629
Then the hell with you!

24:35.641 --> 24:39.941
I'll take my chances in bankruptcy court
before I sell to that barracuda.

24:52.925 --> 24:55.723
Then we have nothing more to talk about.

25:03.503 --> 25:04.470
Six.

25:07.240 --> 25:10.004
Three, and that's it.
If I can sell it to the board.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.076
Five.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.336
- Three.
- All right.

25:12.845 --> 25:16.838
We'll call it an even four,
so it don't look so goddamn pathetic.

25:27.894 --> 25:28.986
Three.

25:29.929 --> 25:31.294
And not a dime more.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.356
<i>We have breaking news right now.</i>

27:14.467 --> 27:17.163
<i>Earlier this morning
in a New York City subway,</i>

27:17.270 --> 27:19.101
<i>Keller Zabel managing partner</i>

27:19.205 --> 27:21.969
<i>and head of one of the biggest
investment firms on Wall Street,</i>

27:22.074 --> 27:24.235
<i>Louis Zabel, 75,</i>

27:24.343 --> 27:26.834
<i>apparently jumped
in front of an oncoming train</i>

27:26.946 --> 27:28.743
<i>in front of hundreds of bystanders.</i>

27:29.181 --> 27:31.547
<i>The stock is currently halted,
pending news...</i>

27:31.651 --> 27:34.176
<i>Churchill Schwartz is making out
like a bandit right now</i>

27:34.287 --> 27:35.311
<i>with government funding.</i>

27:35.421 --> 27:39.187
<i>But Keller Zabel as an independent
investment bank is essentially finished.</i>

27:39.358 --> 27:41.849
<i>Tom, this news about Louis Zabel today</i>

27:41.961 --> 27:44.691
<i>comes as a shock to everyone.
But how are you holding up there?</i>

27:44.797 --> 27:46.856
<i>The guy was an icon on Wall Street.</i>

27:46.966 --> 27:49.230
<i>I always thought of him
as sort of a mentor to me.</i>

27:49.335 --> 27:52.327
<i>So to see this happen
under the circumstances that it did happen,</i>

27:52.438 --> 27:53.598
<i>it's devastating.</i>

27:53.739 --> 27:56.503
<i>What's it mean to the employees
at Keller Zabel?</i>

27:56.809 --> 27:59.835
<i>I think they've lost their leader.
They're going to be...</i>

27:59.945 --> 28:02.345
<i>Frankly, financially,
a lot of them are gonna be badly hurt.</i>

28:02.448 --> 28:03.915
<i>This is gonna hurt on so many fronts.</i>

28:04.016 --> 28:05.779
<i>I know it's still difficult
to think about it,</i>

28:05.885 --> 28:07.580
<i>with this news just coming out about Louis,</i>

28:07.687 --> 28:10.247
<i>but you have to wonder what this means
for the future of Wall Street.</i>

28:10.389 --> 28:14.052
<i>Another firm gone, it leaves
very few players left on the Street.</i>

28:14.393 --> 28:15.485
<i>One thing I know for sure is</i>

28:15.594 --> 28:17.960
<i>more competition is better
than less competition.</i>

28:26.205 --> 28:28.264
I just heard. I'm so sorry.

28:36.349 --> 28:38.249
Will you marry me, Winnie?

28:46.392 --> 28:48.189
Will you marry me?

28:52.198 --> 28:53.688
What's wrong?

28:58.037 --> 29:01.029
It's just something Lou said
about not waiting, you know?

29:01.707 --> 29:03.504
And I love you.

29:09.181 --> 29:10.273
Yes.

29:16.122 --> 29:17.248
Yes?

29:24.630 --> 29:27.963
You know, I should tell you due diligence.
There's some...

29:28.601 --> 29:31.331
I'm out of a job and probably
on the other side of broke, you know.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.067
Awesome.

29:36.375 --> 29:39.139
<i>I'm looking for a home</i>

29:39.612 --> 29:43.173
<i>Where the wheels are turning</i>

29:43.384 --> 29:48.649
<i>Home
Why I keep returning</i>

29:49.188 --> 29:54.922
<i>Home
Will infect whatever you do</i>

29:55.394 --> 29:57.419
In one of the harshest sentences 
ever given

29:57.530 --> 30:01.364
to a white collar criminal
at that time, in 1993,

30:01.467 --> 30:05.801
he was sent off to Otis Federal Prison
for almost eight years.

30:06.705 --> 30:11.699
And so, here in person,
I welcome the man himself, Mr. Insider,

30:11.811 --> 30:13.244
Gordon Gekko.

30:19.552 --> 30:20.951
Thank you.

30:36.435 --> 30:38.027
You're all pretty much fucked.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.364
You don't know it yet,

30:44.410 --> 30:46.776
but you're the Ninja Generation.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.279
No income.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.410
No job.

30:52.218 --> 30:53.480
No assets.

30:54.386 --> 30:56.752
You got a lot to look forward to.

30:58.791 --> 31:01.624
Blood, buddy.
He's gonna be your blood.

31:04.430 --> 31:07.228
Someone reminded me the other evening

31:07.700 --> 31:10.498
that I once said,
"Greed is good."

31:12.404 --> 31:13.701
Now it seems it's legal.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.076
But, folks,

31:19.178 --> 31:23.979
it's greed that makes my bartender
buy three houses he can't afford

31:24.083 --> 31:25.778
with no money down.

31:26.285 --> 31:33.020
And it's greed that makes your parents
refinance their $200,000 house for 250.

31:33.993 --> 31:36.962
And then they take that extra 50
and they go down to the mall.

31:37.062 --> 31:40.691
And they buy a plasma TV,
cell phones,

31:40.799 --> 31:44.064
computers, an SUV.
And hey,

31:44.370 --> 31:47.362
why not a second home while we're at it?
Because, gee whiz,

31:47.473 --> 31:51.739
we all know that prices of houses
in America always go up, right?

31:52.444 --> 31:54.912
It's greed that makes
the government in this country

31:55.014 --> 31:58.677
cut the interest rates to one-percent,
after 9/11.

31:59.251 --> 32:01.219
So we could all go shopping again.

32:01.320 --> 32:04.881
They got all these fancy names
for trillions of dollars of credit.

32:04.990 --> 32:09.017
CMOs, CDOs, SIVs, ABSs.

32:09.528 --> 32:13.123
I honestly think there's may be
only 75 people in the world

32:13.332 --> 32:15.027
who know what they are.

32:17.002 --> 32:18.765
But I'll tell you what they are.

32:18.871 --> 32:22.967
They're WMDs. Weapons of Mass Destruction.
That's what they are.

32:23.075 --> 32:26.636
When I was away,
it seemed like greed got greedier

32:26.745 --> 32:29.270
with a little bit of envy mixed in.

32:30.583 --> 32:35.145
Hedge funders were walking home
with 50, 100 million bucks a year.

32:35.754 --> 32:39.986
So Mr. Banker, he's looks around,
and he says, "My life looks pretty boring."

32:40.192 --> 32:44.891
So he starts leveraging his interests
up to 40, 50 to one

32:44.997 --> 32:46.624
with your money.

32:46.999 --> 32:48.728
Not his, yours.

32:50.202 --> 32:51.362
Because he could.

32:52.037 --> 32:54.528
You're supposed to be borrowing,
not them.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.642
And the beauty of the deal,

32:57.743 --> 33:00.109
no one is responsible.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.205
Because everybody's drinking
the same Kool-Aid.

33:04.883 --> 33:06.578
Last year, ladies and gentlemen,

33:06.685 --> 33:10.382
forty percent of all 
American corporate profits

33:10.489 --> 33:12.423
came from financial services.

33:12.758 --> 33:13.850
Not production,

33:13.959 --> 33:17.588
not anything remotely to do
with the needs of the American public.

33:17.963 --> 33:19.863
The truth is,
we're all part of it now.

33:20.699 --> 33:24.658
Banks, consumers,
we're moving money around in circles.

33:25.137 --> 33:26.798
We take a buck,

33:26.905 --> 33:30.671
we shoot it full of steroids,
and we call it "leverage."

33:32.544 --> 33:34.637
I call it "steroid banking."

33:36.382 --> 33:39.112
I've been considered a pretty smart guy
when it comes to finance.

33:39.218 --> 33:40.185
That was fantastic, man.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.646
And maybe I was in prison too long.

33:42.921 --> 33:45.481
But sometimes it's the only place
to stay sane

33:45.624 --> 33:47.421
and look out
through those bars and say,

33:47.526 --> 33:49.960
"Hey! Is everybody out there nuts?"

33:57.803 --> 34:00.533
It's clear as a bell
to those that pay attention.

34:03.075 --> 34:06.636
The mother of all evil is speculation.

34:08.781 --> 34:10.646
Leveraged debt.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.444
Bottom line.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.444
It's borrowing to the hilt.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.156
And I hate to tell you this,

34:19.257 --> 34:22.556
but it's a bankrupt business model.
It won't work.

34:23.495 --> 34:27.795
It's systemic, malignant,
and it's global.

34:29.068 --> 34:30.262
Like cancer.

34:31.837 --> 34:35.295
It's a disease,
and we got to fight back.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.538
How are we gonna do that?

34:39.143 --> 34:42.773
How are we gonna leverage that disease
back in our favor?

34:44.983 --> 34:46.245
Well, I'll tell you.

34:47.351 --> 34:49.047
Three words.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.357
Buy my book.

34:58.130 --> 35:00.257
Prices and profits work.

35:03.302 --> 35:04.997
This is the kind of energy
we need out there.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.196
You just keep it up.

35:06.371 --> 35:07.565
Mr. Gekko!

35:08.874 --> 35:11.843
- Excuse me for a moment, sir.
- Q and A's over, all right?

35:12.611 --> 35:15.512
Buy the book.
There's no more free advice.

35:15.714 --> 35:18.114
My name is Jacob Moore.
I'm gonna marry your daughter.

35:22.921 --> 35:24.149
Does she know that?

35:24.990 --> 35:26.321
She pretended to.

35:28.093 --> 35:30.027
All right, I'll give you 10 minutes.

35:30.896 --> 35:34.696
I'm a prop trader at Keller Zabel.
I specialize in energy with a focus on...

35:34.800 --> 35:36.358
Sorry about Lou.

35:36.468 --> 35:39.028
One of the toughest guys
that ever wore shoes.

35:39.138 --> 35:40.503
But when those rumors start...

35:40.606 --> 35:42.699
Yeah. I wish I knew who started this.

35:42.808 --> 35:43.866
I loved him very much.

35:44.143 --> 35:45.269
Like a father.

35:45.377 --> 35:48.403
He got me a scholarship here at Fordham
and hired me right out of business school.

35:48.514 --> 35:52.575
Well, no one else in this market's
had the balls to commit suicide.

35:53.085 --> 35:55.110
It's an honorable thing to do.

35:57.790 --> 35:59.781
Mr. Gekko, I'm in love with your daughter.

35:59.892 --> 36:01.484
And I'd be honored...

36:02.427 --> 36:04.224
Why is that funny?

36:04.329 --> 36:07.787
My daughter hasn't spoken to me in years,
and you know it.

36:07.900 --> 36:10.368
She blames me for her brother's overdose

36:10.502 --> 36:13.562
and just about every other disaster
that's hit this world

36:13.672 --> 36:15.333
since Nintendo.

36:16.308 --> 36:19.573
You don't think it's strange that she's
dating somebody from Wall Street?

36:19.678 --> 36:22.408
- Why?
- Because she hates it.

36:22.514 --> 36:25.210
You don't think it's funny
that she'd fall in love with you?

36:29.021 --> 36:30.283
I bet you don't have one of these.

36:31.156 --> 36:33.420
No. Can I see that?

36:33.625 --> 36:34.592
Yeah.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.652
It's when she was eight.

36:38.263 --> 36:41.596
Can I have a copy of it?
She doesn't keep pictures from her childhood.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.931
I don't even know you,
you already want something from me, huh?

36:45.504 --> 36:47.563
So what do I get in return?

36:47.673 --> 36:49.937
Don't you want to make a trade?

36:50.042 --> 36:51.873
Yeah, okay. All right.

36:51.977 --> 36:55.003
I'll give you this and you give me
another picture of Winnie.

36:55.113 --> 36:57.445
Recent, without you in it.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.176
I don't have one on me.

36:59.284 --> 37:01.184
I guess this is on margin, huh?

37:05.791 --> 37:07.190
It's always been energy.

37:07.459 --> 37:09.256
I've been specializing more and more
in clean tech.

37:09.361 --> 37:10.692
It's sort of a passion now.

37:10.796 --> 37:13.287
That's smart.
That's the next bubble.

37:13.498 --> 37:16.990
What are you,
some kind of energy freedom-fighter?

37:17.202 --> 37:19.796
No, Mr. Gekko. I'm in this game
to make money like anybody else.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.805
So what about money, Jake?

37:21.907 --> 37:23.067
You like her?

37:24.042 --> 37:25.600
Do I like...

37:25.711 --> 37:28.202
I've never thought about money as a "she."

37:28.413 --> 37:29.573
Oh!

37:29.681 --> 37:32.548
She lies there in bed at night with you,

37:32.751 --> 37:34.719
looking at you, one eye open.

37:37.923 --> 37:40.483
Money's a bitch that never sleeps.

37:41.226 --> 37:42.921
And she's jealous.

37:43.028 --> 37:45.292
And if you don't pay close,
close attention,

37:45.397 --> 37:48.764
you wake up in the morning,
and she might be gone forever.

37:52.504 --> 37:53.994
Respectfully,

37:54.106 --> 37:56.631
Mr. Gekko, I don't want to end up
where you are because of money.

37:56.742 --> 37:58.767
Oh, yeah.
So marry it instead, right?

38:02.848 --> 38:04.213
What do you mean?

38:05.317 --> 38:06.511
Winnie doesn't have any money.

38:09.922 --> 38:10.889
Right.

38:11.690 --> 38:14.090
Here I thought you were a gold-digger.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.627
Does Winnie know you came to see me?

38:17.729 --> 38:19.026
No.

38:19.231 --> 38:22.496
Well, not exactly.
I was gonna tell her.

38:23.702 --> 38:26.466
I don't think that's a good idea, pal.

38:26.571 --> 38:28.766
See, I got a feeling
you may want to be seeing me again

38:28.874 --> 38:31.308
and if she knew
we had this little pow-wow,

38:31.410 --> 38:32.877
she's not gonna let it happen.

38:36.448 --> 38:38.439
You know what?
You're a smart kid.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.780
You should just walk away.
You never met me.

38:40.886 --> 38:42.353
I don't understand.

38:42.554 --> 38:43.612
I think...

38:43.855 --> 38:47.256
The man that you loved like a father
who threw himself under a subway?

38:47.359 --> 38:49.088
I think you're angrier
than you think you are.

38:49.194 --> 38:52.163
And I think you wanna be
in the family business.

38:52.898 --> 38:54.297
Which is what?

38:54.399 --> 38:55.593
Payback.

38:56.301 --> 38:58.269
Except I'm not in that business anymore.

38:58.370 --> 39:00.031
Because the one thing I learned in jail

39:00.138 --> 39:03.403
is that money is not
the prime asset in life.

39:03.508 --> 39:04.497
Time is.

39:04.609 --> 39:06.076
And your time is just about up.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.644
Winnie needs to get past
the pain you caused her.

39:11.283 --> 39:12.443
I caused her?

39:12.584 --> 39:14.677
Look, she wants you back in her life.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.617
She just can't handle it right now.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.656
Okay? Maybe I can help.

39:18.757 --> 39:23.126
Maybe you can, maybe you can.
That's what makes the market, Jake.

39:23.328 --> 39:24.955
This is my station.

39:25.063 --> 39:27.293
That is my email address.

39:36.441 --> 39:39.877
By the way, the rumors on Zabel?

39:39.978 --> 39:41.138
Yeah?

39:41.246 --> 39:43.544
It had to be someone
with enough clout to be believed,

39:43.648 --> 39:46.378
somebody who made a fortune
shorting the stock.

39:46.485 --> 39:48.385
An axe to grind.

39:49.187 --> 39:53.146
Word has it that Bretton James
gutted Zabel at the Fed.

39:53.358 --> 39:56.259
Just stuck that knife
right into his stomach.

40:03.435 --> 40:05.096
Check out 2000.

40:05.203 --> 40:06.898
The Internet bubble.

40:07.005 --> 40:09.269
Churchill Schwartz, they got hosed.

40:11.676 --> 40:14.110
You know there's fortunes to be made.

40:14.212 --> 40:17.670
Hundreds of millions of dollars
betting against this bubble.

40:17.783 --> 40:19.216
Just wish I had a million.

40:26.258 --> 40:27.555
It checks out, baby.

40:27.926 --> 40:32.260
Thirteen banks were approached in 2000
to rescue Churchill Schwartz.

40:32.464 --> 40:35.900
Bretton James' division was over-invested
in the Internet bubble collapse.

40:36.735 --> 40:39.363
Each bank was going to put up 100 million,
but Zabel said no.

40:39.471 --> 40:40.802
Churchill Schwartz almost went down

40:40.906 --> 40:42.601
but was backstopped
by a conglomerate of nine banks.

40:42.741 --> 40:44.732
Okay, so not only did they survive this,

40:44.843 --> 40:47.903
but they came back
and ate our fricking lunch.

40:48.013 --> 40:49.002
Moral hazard.

40:49.114 --> 40:50.741
- Unbelievable.
- The man's a hypocrite.

40:53.051 --> 40:54.211
Jacob Moore.

40:54.319 --> 40:55.684
- <i>Hey, Jake.</i>
- Hey, Doc.

40:56.555 --> 40:59.752
I don't know, Jake. We're on hold here.
Now they're telling me...

40:59.858 --> 41:01.951
Hold on just a second.
Hold on just a second.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.388
- I'll see you. We'll have drinks.
- Okay.

41:03.495 --> 41:05.292
- It's not over. All right, Olaf?
- Thank you.

41:05.397 --> 41:06.386
Go ahead, Doc.

41:06.498 --> 41:08.966
They're telling me we have to cut staff.

41:09.734 --> 41:12.965
We went back to Third Boston,
and they turned us down.

41:13.171 --> 41:14.798
<i>And since your firm, um...</i>

41:15.740 --> 41:17.503
Listen, I totally understand, okay?

41:17.609 --> 41:20.043
But I think I can keep this thing going
with minimal cutbacks.

41:20.145 --> 41:21.169
<i>Look, Jake.</i>

41:21.646 --> 41:24.308
I think we have to have a face-to-face talk
with my people, because...

41:24.416 --> 41:25.383
I totally agree, Doc.

41:25.484 --> 41:27.645
It's just that I'm walking into
a critical meeting right now. Okay?

41:28.854 --> 41:31.550
But I'll definitely have it on your desk
tomorrow a.m., okay?

41:31.656 --> 41:32.714
- Okay.
- Okay.

41:33.158 --> 41:34.147
Robby, what do you got?

41:34.259 --> 41:36.352
We got movement definitely
on Tuesday of that week.

41:36.461 --> 41:38.429
There was some large shorts
from money out of the Cayman Islands.

41:38.530 --> 41:39.827
Something called Locust Fund.

41:40.031 --> 41:41.055
Locust Fund.

41:41.166 --> 41:42.190
What else?

41:42.300 --> 41:44.291
Wednesday, they traded
another 500,000 shares.

41:44.402 --> 41:45.596
Monday, two million.

41:45.704 --> 41:47.968
Tuesday, one million more.
Total of 3.5 million shares.

41:48.073 --> 41:50.200
These guys made some serious money.

41:51.476 --> 41:52.875
Who is that, though?
Who is the Locust Fund?

41:52.978 --> 41:55.378
I don't know. And I don't want to find out.
It could be my ass.

41:55.580 --> 41:58.310
It'll be your ass if I tell your girlfriend
about the pumps and heels.

41:58.416 --> 41:59.383
Which girlfriend?

41:59.484 --> 42:01.418
Just find out, all right?
I got a hunch.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.283
<i>I hope it's better than your last one.</i>

42:03.388 --> 42:04.980
Do I hear revenge here?

42:05.090 --> 42:07.217
It's a dish you stick to cold, pal.

42:07.526 --> 42:09.619
I'm about to serve it up hot, Robby.

42:18.003 --> 42:19.664
I told you.
Guinea's pulling the plug.

42:19.771 --> 42:22.899
This dictator, Ojukwa,
he says Western bankers are greedy.

42:23.008 --> 42:24.669
- What else is new?
- Listen. Okay?

42:24.776 --> 42:27.609
You will not lose on this.
Not on this.

42:27.712 --> 42:29.270
Look, if there's one thing I know,
it's energy,

42:29.381 --> 42:31.406
and that the Church
is gonna get hit on this.

42:35.687 --> 42:37.177
Is this true?

42:37.289 --> 42:39.917
Oh, yeah.
I'm telling you, it's gonna happen.

42:40.025 --> 42:43.552
He's definitely gonna nationalize the oil.
I promise you.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.086
Are you behind it?

42:45.197 --> 42:47.358
No. Churchill Schwartz is.
They got a huge stake.

42:47.465 --> 42:50.263
Can't get behind that size,
but you and your boys can.

42:50.368 --> 42:51.995
You should.

42:52.304 --> 42:53.532
All I'm asking

42:53.638 --> 42:56.106
is you rent me this beautiful thing
for the weekend, and we're good.

42:56.208 --> 42:57.402
Deal?

42:59.244 --> 43:01.075
Deal. Super deal.

43:10.288 --> 43:11.755
Can he just take over the oil like that?

43:11.856 --> 43:13.790
The guy's out of his mind.
He's talking to witch doctors.

43:13.892 --> 43:14.859
He's gonna murder the stock.

43:14.960 --> 43:16.689
I know. That's why you gotta get in.

43:18.763 --> 43:21.664
Jake, that company, Offshore African Oil...

43:21.866 --> 43:24.130
Yeah. Hydra Offshore.

43:24.236 --> 43:26.704
And you're saying
Churchill Schwartz is a part of it?

43:26.805 --> 43:27.829
Mmm-hmm.

43:28.940 --> 43:32.273
Over here is gonna be
the most expensive item by tomorrow.

43:32.477 --> 43:35.105
It's Alice, in Wonderland.

43:37.148 --> 43:39.673
Churchill Schwartz
has a huge position in this thing.

43:39.784 --> 43:40.842
I want to get short that stock.

43:40.952 --> 43:42.351
Churchill Schwartz is behind that?

43:42.454 --> 43:44.115
It's just a rumor.
It might take a hit.

43:48.226 --> 43:49.784
Hear about that African deal?

43:49.995 --> 43:51.690
Yeah, I heard they're gonna nationalize.

43:53.398 --> 43:55.832
Churchill Schwartz! Off the floor!

43:57.168 --> 43:59.295
They're creating rumors
around the Hydra position.

43:59.404 --> 44:01.668
None of it's true.
They're just trying to kill the stock.

44:01.773 --> 44:02.967
<i>Doesn't make any difference
what's going on.</i>

44:03.074 --> 44:05.440
<i>Then start another goddamn rumor
is what you do.</i>

44:05.543 --> 44:08.239
<i>...short quickly and quietly
without everyone figuring out...</i>

44:08.380 --> 44:10.712
I'm convinced what they're after is Churchill,

44:10.815 --> 44:12.339
which has a big position in this stock

44:12.450 --> 44:14.577
because Churchill got
the sweetheart deal on Keller Zabel.

44:14.686 --> 44:16.517
Churchill Schwartz has
a five-percent position in it.

44:16.621 --> 44:20.751
Who knows? Who's got the inside line
on some tin-pot dictator in Africa?

44:32.270 --> 44:33.237
<i>House of pain.</i>

44:33.338 --> 44:34.600
<i>The house of pain!</i>

44:34.806 --> 44:37.240
<i>Hydra Offshore got taken
to the woodshed today.</i>

44:38.677 --> 44:41.202
<i>This one's getting beaten
like a redhead stepchild.</i>

44:41.313 --> 44:44.407
<i>Down a quick 19%
on rumors of oil nationalization...</i>

44:44.616 --> 44:46.174
<i>No, no!</i>

44:46.384 --> 44:49.410
<i>in Equatorial Guinea.
There's a country for you.</i>

44:49.521 --> 44:50.510
Get them.

44:50.622 --> 44:51.589
<i>The shockwave from this one</i>

44:51.690 --> 44:55.353
<i>extended all the way
to investment bank Churchill Schwartz.</i>

44:55.460 --> 44:58.793
<i>Churchill Schwartz down eight percent
in pre-market trading.</i>

44:59.964 --> 45:03.593
<i>Home builder confidence falls
to a record low in July.</i>

45:03.868 --> 45:06.632
<i>The monthly indicator from the
National Association of Homebuilders</i>

45:06.738 --> 45:08.729
<i>dropped for a third consecutive month...</i>

45:08.840 --> 45:10.432
You got your high ceilings.

45:11.042 --> 45:14.534
Bonus playroom upstairs,
not that I'm rushing you.

45:16.214 --> 45:17.374
Oh. Here.

45:17.982 --> 45:21.918
This is going to be the sun room.
Perfect for reading.

45:22.020 --> 45:23.453
It'll get great light.

45:23.955 --> 45:26.219
And there's plenty of room for a pool

45:26.324 --> 45:28.292
or a tennis court. See?

45:29.260 --> 45:32.195
What's going on with Rainwater Road, Ma?

45:32.497 --> 45:33.759
I'm showing it tomorrow.

45:33.865 --> 45:35.162
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

45:36.167 --> 45:37.600
Sylvia, I think it's lovely.

45:37.702 --> 45:39.727
Long Island always goes up.

45:39.838 --> 45:42.773
Great schools, great shopping,
lots of doctors.

45:42.874 --> 45:44.671
Everybody loves it here.

45:45.610 --> 45:46.804
You ought to buy it.

45:48.613 --> 45:50.808
There are quite a few choices
on this block.

45:52.517 --> 45:56.317
That's what I love about you, dear.
You call it like you see it.

45:56.421 --> 45:58.719
I'd rather have this down payment any day.

46:01.126 --> 46:02.218
Ma, you got three properties.

46:02.694 --> 46:03.991
Two of the loans are resetting
in a few months.

46:04.095 --> 46:05.357
You got to sell at least one.

46:05.730 --> 46:10.258
Oh, don't tell me my job, Jacob.
There are no buyers out there right now.

46:10.368 --> 46:12.461
The market's soft.
Everybody reads the same news.

46:12.570 --> 46:14.197
I just gotta wait it out.

46:14.305 --> 46:16.569
It's like the two Florida properties
five years ago.

46:16.674 --> 46:20.474
I didn't get spooked,
and I flipped 190 grand from them.

46:23.081 --> 46:24.173
What does Henry say?

46:24.282 --> 46:25.681
Oh, Henry. Forget about him.
He's a wimp.

46:25.784 --> 46:26.910
That's done?

46:27.152 --> 46:29.052
Oh, if I listened to Henry,

46:29.154 --> 46:31.987
I would have sold every house
way too soon.

46:32.090 --> 46:34.024
He's just like your father was.

46:34.125 --> 46:35.387
No. Dad had bad luck.

46:35.493 --> 46:37.290
He took a shot and he failed.
But he took a shot, Ma.

46:37.395 --> 46:39.727
Yeah, and then Jack Daniels took his shot,
and he succeeded.

46:39.831 --> 46:42.391
Can we not have an argument
about my father every time I come to see you?

46:42.500 --> 46:45.094
So sensitive.
Forget I said anything.

46:45.470 --> 46:49.600
God. Defending your father
is like defending smallpox.

46:49.808 --> 46:50.866
Look.

46:52.444 --> 46:56.972
The developers are on my ass, okay?
I just need you to bridge me.

46:57.782 --> 46:59.306
What about the money from Sagamir Road?

46:59.417 --> 47:02.250
What do you think?
I put it into the new properties.

47:02.353 --> 47:04.753
What did you think,
it was just gonna shoot up in perpetuity?

47:04.856 --> 47:07.222
Don't patronize your mother,
Jacob Lawrence.

47:07.325 --> 47:09.156
Of course I know the risks involved.

47:09.260 --> 47:12.320
Hey, you're buying diamonds.
You got the bonus, right?

47:12.430 --> 47:16.059
I remember visiting you when I was young
at the hospital after school, thinking,

47:16.167 --> 47:18.567
"How cool is this?
My mother is saving lives."

47:18.670 --> 47:20.661
- Don't change the subject.
- I'm not changing the subject.

47:20.772 --> 47:22.296
I never saved any lives.

47:22.407 --> 47:24.341
Yeah, but you did something,
and that's the point, Mom.

47:24.442 --> 47:28.173
I make more in a month now
than I did in my best year as a nurse.

47:28.279 --> 47:29.837
You made a difference.

47:30.949 --> 47:33.850
Listen to the broker
preaching making a difference.

47:34.052 --> 47:35.519
That's ironic.

47:36.821 --> 47:38.118
How much?

47:39.858 --> 47:41.655
Two hundred, tops.

47:43.461 --> 47:45.258
You're killing me, Ma!

47:48.633 --> 47:50.430
I'll wire it to you.

47:53.705 --> 47:55.229
Can you stop, please?

47:56.374 --> 47:57.602
You're not doing her any favors.

47:57.942 --> 47:59.409
I know.

47:59.878 --> 48:03.109
And you're not preventing it
from happening again.

48:06.985 --> 48:08.384
I'll shut up.

48:11.523 --> 48:13.115
- Yeah?
- <i>Guess what?</i>

48:13.591 --> 48:14.615
Your boy, Bretton James?

48:14.726 --> 48:17.718
His assistant just called me and asked
if you can see him today.

48:17.862 --> 48:18.829
You're kidding me.

48:19.631 --> 48:22.127
Jake, you have an hour.
I told him you were on the island.

48:22.233 --> 48:24.030
Yeah, but I'm in the middle
of Friday afternoon traffic.

48:24.135 --> 48:28.003
But he said after hours is okay,
because he left his home address.

48:28.106 --> 48:30.836
East 65th Street and Park Avenue, honey.
Up to 8 p.m.

48:30.942 --> 48:31.966
Did he sound upset?

48:32.076 --> 48:33.907
Screw him, he destroyed this company.

48:34.012 --> 48:36.606
You waltz in there
like Russell Crowe in <i>Gladiator.</i>

48:36.714 --> 48:37.874
Thanks, babe.

48:39.317 --> 48:42.013
Sounds like you're getting
your walking papers.

48:44.722 --> 48:47.054
Jake, look, I don't need this ring now.

48:47.158 --> 48:49.023
Just give me one
out of a Cracker Jack box instead...

48:49.127 --> 48:50.594
What are you talking about?

48:50.695 --> 48:52.322
Are you crazy?
Everything's gonna be fine.

48:52.430 --> 48:54.898
Jake, I grew up with a father
who only talked about money.

48:54.999 --> 48:56.125
If you think I want to be
with the kind of guy

48:56.234 --> 48:57.895
with his ego invested in his bank account,

48:58.002 --> 48:58.991
you really don't get me.

49:02.840 --> 49:04.569
"I love it," was what I was expecting.

49:06.277 --> 49:07.744
Return it.
It makes me uncomfortable.

49:07.845 --> 49:09.608
Okay, Winnie.
I'll return it.

49:24.696 --> 49:25.993
Jacob Moore to see Mr. James.

49:26.531 --> 49:27.998
He's expecting you.

49:55.994 --> 49:58.428
<i>Saturno Devorando A Su Hijo.</i>

49:59.297 --> 50:02.164
Goya painted 15 Black Paintings
late in his life.

50:02.266 --> 50:04.530
Fourteen of them are on view in the Prado.

50:04.636 --> 50:06.797
That's the missing 15th.

50:06.904 --> 50:10.237
An early sketch
for Saturn devouring his son.

50:14.479 --> 50:16.003
Do you collect?

50:16.114 --> 50:17.342
No.

50:17.448 --> 50:20.315
Only the obsessive-compulsive
and the insecurely egotistical

50:20.418 --> 50:22.113
feel the need to collect things.

50:28.760 --> 50:30.227
Do you ride?

50:32.630 --> 50:34.655
It's an avocation, yes.

50:34.866 --> 50:36.663
You know the photograph.

50:36.768 --> 50:39.464
Rollie Free, 1948.

50:39.570 --> 50:41.731
He set the world record at 150.

50:41.839 --> 50:44.330
And wanted it so bad he rode naked.

50:44.976 --> 50:47.137
Why, you ride, Mr. Moore?

50:50.715 --> 50:52.046
I'll put it to you this way.

50:52.150 --> 50:54.448
If you rode the rest of your life, right,

50:54.552 --> 50:56.782
and really became the best
that you could be,

50:56.888 --> 50:58.287
you would never ride like I ride.

51:00.692 --> 51:03.490
Well, then I look forward
to us riding together.

51:08.800 --> 51:11.098
You a bee, Mr. Moore?

51:15.306 --> 51:16.295
A what?

51:18.142 --> 51:21.009
Do you like to sting people?

51:23.381 --> 51:27.841
You cost Churchill Schwartz
$120 million last week.

51:29.554 --> 51:31.749
That's not a great deal of money.

51:31.856 --> 51:35.189
But people know Hydra Offshore is ours.

51:41.432 --> 51:46.426
I had dinner with the good
Commander Ojukwa in Paris last week.

51:46.537 --> 51:50.803
He has no actual plans
of nationalizing any oil fields.

51:51.008 --> 51:53.033
But I guess that doesn't
really matter to you.

51:53.911 --> 51:56.175
No, it doesn't.

51:56.280 --> 51:58.271
I checked you out with the desks in town.

51:58.382 --> 52:00.350
You didn't make any money off it.

52:00.451 --> 52:01.975
No, I didn't.

52:02.887 --> 52:04.514
Then why?

52:06.290 --> 52:08.121
Because you destroyed my firm.

52:08.226 --> 52:09.250
Your firm destroyed itself.

52:09.360 --> 52:10.657
You killed Louis Zabel.

52:11.963 --> 52:13.294
Louis Zabel killed himself.

52:13.397 --> 52:14.421
But you set the rumors.

52:14.532 --> 52:15.521
The rumors were true.

52:16.634 --> 52:17.760
You made them true.

52:18.369 --> 52:19.529
No, Mr. Moore.

52:19.670 --> 52:23.970
Putting 50% leverage on toxic debt
made them true.

52:24.075 --> 52:26.703
Look, Zabel once knew how to run money.

52:26.811 --> 52:28.802
Dying because of it was his choice.

52:28.913 --> 52:31.575
As far as I'm concerned,
it's just money.

52:31.682 --> 52:34.173
But when you don't know
what you're doing,

52:34.285 --> 52:36.116
it's fatal, Mr. Moore.

52:36.220 --> 52:38.415
Not knowing what you're doing.

52:44.962 --> 52:46.759
Come work for me.

52:48.032 --> 52:49.329
What?

52:49.433 --> 52:52.300
We fund most of the world's
integrated oil companies,

52:52.403 --> 52:55.167
drillers, coal producers,
natural gas line providers...

52:55.273 --> 52:56.797
I know who you are.

52:56.908 --> 52:58.739
But where we're a little light

52:59.811 --> 53:02.405
is in alternative energy.

53:04.882 --> 53:06.179
Why me?

53:06.651 --> 53:08.551
Because your loyalty demanded revenge.

53:08.653 --> 53:12.316
Your balls actually attempted it,
and your skill pulled it off.

53:13.391 --> 53:14.688
And frankly,

53:16.194 --> 53:19.527
because I'd love to
beat the crap out of you on a bike.

53:19.630 --> 53:20.995
Fair enough?

53:23.067 --> 53:26.833
You got my attention, Mr. Moore.
That's pretty rare.

53:27.271 --> 53:30.866
If I were you,
I'd think seriously about it.

53:30.975 --> 53:35.912
Because you'll have a hard time elsewhere,
now that you've captured our attention.

53:36.781 --> 53:39.978
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm having a little fundraiser.

53:41.118 --> 53:43.848
I got to get back to shaking my tin cup.

53:44.622 --> 53:46.214
What's your number?

53:46.324 --> 53:47.621
I'm sorry?

53:47.825 --> 53:50.760
We'd start you at 300,
like everybody else.

53:50.862 --> 53:53.262
I mean, as a partner, I only pull in 600.
And the bonuses...

53:53.364 --> 53:54.763
No, no, no.

53:55.099 --> 53:56.361
Your number.

53:56.934 --> 54:00.631
The amount of money you would need
to just walk away from it and live.

54:00.738 --> 54:03.400
See, I find that everybody has a number,
and it's usually an exact number.

54:03.507 --> 54:05.441
So what is yours?

54:09.614 --> 54:10.979
More.

54:29.734 --> 54:31.998
How did you know it was Bretton James?

54:32.103 --> 54:34.333
Good morning to you, too.
Come in.

54:34.438 --> 54:35.928
- Good morning.
- You hungry?

54:36.040 --> 54:37.564
No. I'm okay, thanks.

54:41.078 --> 54:43.103
Brett, as I called him
in the old days,

54:43.214 --> 54:44.306
used to run trades through me.

54:44.415 --> 54:47.509
We used to piggyback off
each other's ideas.

54:47.952 --> 54:51.945
Then we had a little discrepancy.
I won't bother you with the details.

54:52.056 --> 54:55.457
Just to tell you that
it cost me 200,000 bucks,

54:55.559 --> 54:57.789
which was a lot of money back then.

54:57.895 --> 55:02.025
So when I got hot in the '80s,
and I started giving tastes to my friends,

55:02.133 --> 55:06.126
I didn't invite James in,
and he didn't like that very much.

55:06.337 --> 55:07.770
So?

55:08.472 --> 55:11.066
So it's no big deal.

55:11.776 --> 55:15.439
But when you're in prison,
you got a lot of time to think.

55:17.915 --> 55:22.181
In fact, the best memory
that I know is hurt.

55:22.954 --> 55:25.855
I did eight years, pal.
Five years before that in court.

55:25.957 --> 55:29.950
Nobody does eight years.
They give murderers five.

55:30.928 --> 55:34.227
I thought it was the kid
with the airline that gave you up.

55:34.332 --> 55:36.698
Blue Star? Stock Watch?
What was it?

55:36.801 --> 55:38.291
- Who, Bud Fox?
- Bud Fox.

55:38.402 --> 55:41.462
No, no, no. He got a wire on him.
He got me for insider trading.

55:41.572 --> 55:44.234
But that's 12, 13 months, max.

55:44.342 --> 55:49.302
After the first charges, it was one of my
co-conspirators who tipped off the Feds.

55:50.848 --> 55:53.817
And that pious piranha, Bretton James,

55:53.918 --> 55:56.910
he had just enough information
to sink me.

55:57.021 --> 55:59.615
You know, of course,
I'm never going to know it for sure.

56:00.658 --> 56:02.387
He offered me a job.

56:06.293 --> 56:10.889
Well, you just rocketed
into the center of the universe, pal.

56:10.998 --> 56:14.729
I think my daughter's future
is looking a hell of a lot better.

56:15.168 --> 56:17.033
I never made any money shorting Hydra.

56:18.138 --> 56:19.400
You're kidding me.
You didn't trade it?

56:19.840 --> 56:22.536
That would've been insider trading,
Mr. Gekko.

56:23.243 --> 56:24.642
Remember, your daughter and I
are engaged.

56:24.745 --> 56:26.645
You wouldn't want to soil her name, right?

56:26.747 --> 56:28.647
Well, you may not have traded,

56:28.749 --> 56:31.877
but you try telling the Feds
you didn't commit a felony.

56:31.985 --> 56:34.476
- What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

56:34.588 --> 56:39.321
You induced others to trade on information
that you knew to be false.

56:44.831 --> 56:47.231
Hard to prove that.

56:49.536 --> 56:53.836
A fisherman always sees
another fisherman from afar.

56:57.344 --> 57:00.745
I think you ought to start
calling me Gordon.

57:00.947 --> 57:03.313
Well, I promised you this,

57:03.850 --> 57:05.408
Gordon.

57:05.619 --> 57:06.586
Makes us even.

57:07.754 --> 57:08.721
There she is.

57:08.822 --> 57:10.414
But keep this between us, though.

57:12.459 --> 57:14.324
How is that lefty website of hers doing?

57:14.428 --> 57:15.827
- Frozen Truth?
- Yeah.

57:15.929 --> 57:18.898
It's doing well, actually.
They get about 50,000 hits a day.

57:18.999 --> 57:20.466
- It's building.
- Mmm.

57:22.135 --> 57:24.160
She was such a pisser.

57:25.005 --> 57:28.406
Relationships, they're like bubbles.

57:28.508 --> 57:31.306
They're fragile.
It's like these tulips.

57:31.945 --> 57:34.914
This is the greatest bubble story
of all time.

57:35.015 --> 57:38.143
Back in the 1600s, the Dutch,
they get speculation fever

57:38.251 --> 57:42.779
to the point that you could buy
a beautiful house on a canal in Amsterdam,

57:42.889 --> 57:45.858
for the price of one bulb.

57:46.693 --> 57:49.025
They called it "Tulip Mania."

57:49.229 --> 57:50.560
Then it collapsed.

57:50.664 --> 57:52.359
You could buy 10 bulbs for $2.

57:52.466 --> 57:55.697
People got wiped out, but,
you know, who remembers?

57:56.536 --> 57:57.935
What would you do with your money?

57:58.638 --> 58:00.936
Me? Switzerland.
Still the best.

58:01.208 --> 58:04.268
Got a healthy distrust
for a big government.

58:04.377 --> 58:06.777
Is that where you keep it?

58:06.880 --> 58:10.441
Yes, I did. Now I don't got
that kind of cash anymore.

58:12.819 --> 58:14.184
But you do have money.

58:16.823 --> 58:18.415
This is a rental.

58:20.427 --> 58:24.227
I'm pretty sure James has invested
in an offshore fund in the Caymans.

58:24.331 --> 58:27.892
Your time, you ever do anything with
some company called Locust Fund?

58:28.001 --> 58:31.664
Locust Fund. I never heard of it,
but it's possible. Yeah.

58:31.771 --> 58:34.171
James wants to build
his alternative energy sector.

58:34.274 --> 58:35.332
Sounds serious.

58:35.442 --> 58:38.434
I think I can get him to put real capital
behind this company I told you about.

58:38.678 --> 58:40.236
United Fusion.

58:40.347 --> 58:43.748
James would probably want to polish
his resume a little green.

58:43.850 --> 58:47.183
He's in pole position to be top dog
when Julie Steinhardt kicks the bucket,

58:47.287 --> 58:49.278
which, I hear, could be any day now.

58:49.389 --> 58:52.483
This company could change not just the
energy market, Gordon, but the world.

58:52.692 --> 58:55.490
Idealism. Idealism, pal,
it kills every deal.

58:55.595 --> 58:59.190
The thing you got to know about James is,
he's a gambler. You know, like me.

58:59.299 --> 59:03.360
He's got an ego the size of Antarctica.
Like me.

59:04.371 --> 59:06.236
So now you got his attention.

59:06.339 --> 59:08.000
How are you going to shine
sitting on his sun?

59:10.710 --> 59:13.440
Make him money and melt his ass.

59:14.648 --> 59:18.914
Just like the old days.
We slaughtered men for payback.

59:21.288 --> 59:24.451
Maybe it's time for us
to do our second trade?

59:26.293 --> 59:29.160
All right. I'll dig around on James
and this Locust Fund,

59:29.262 --> 59:30.854
and you see what you can do about

59:30.964 --> 59:32.829
getting Winnie and me
back together again.

59:32.933 --> 59:36.460
Well, I never guaranteed
she'd forgive you, Gordon.

59:36.570 --> 59:40.006
Why don't we just start with her
agreeing to have dinner with you first, huh?

59:40.106 --> 59:43.906
Well, at my age,
I'll take anything I can get.

59:46.713 --> 59:48.840
I had two beautiful children.

59:50.383 --> 59:54.012
And then I went away,
and I didn't see them much.

59:55.155 --> 59:57.123
My ex made sure of that.

59:59.392 --> 01:00:01.189
And then when we lost Rudy,

01:00:03.863 --> 01:00:06.764
Winnie just shut down on me.

01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:20.277
Except for the exceedingly precious

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:22.746
and depreciating asset of time.

01:00:23.083 --> 01:00:25.574
Winnie's all I got left.
You understand that?

01:00:25.685 --> 01:00:27.949
I'll try, Gordon.

01:00:28.588 --> 01:00:33.025
Well, try harder.
Then you both can have a father.

01:00:45.572 --> 01:00:47.437
- He chose this place?
- Yeah.

01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:50.475
Yeah, we used to come here
every Sunday night.

01:00:50.577 --> 01:00:52.169
You're going to be fine.

01:00:52.279 --> 01:00:54.543
You do know I'm never
having sex with you again.

01:00:54.714 --> 01:00:59.174
Then what my friends say about marriage
is actually true. Five back.

01:00:59.286 --> 01:01:00.548
I'm only doing this for you.

01:01:00.654 --> 01:01:02.781
No, baby. You're doing this for you.
Come on.

01:01:03.156 --> 01:01:04.589
Taxi!

01:01:20.307 --> 01:01:21.501
Hi.

01:01:22.709 --> 01:01:23.676
Hey.

01:01:24.511 --> 01:01:25.535
Mr. Gekko.

01:01:25.645 --> 01:01:28.079
Jacob Moore.
We spoke on the phone.

01:01:28.381 --> 01:01:29.370
Yeah.

01:01:35.922 --> 01:01:37.116
Okay.

01:01:41.795 --> 01:01:42.762
Drinks?

01:01:44.431 --> 01:01:45.420
No.

01:01:45.799 --> 01:01:47.426
What about you? Heineken?

01:01:47.534 --> 01:01:48.694
Yeah, sure.

01:01:57.477 --> 01:02:01.243
Let me guess.
The ginger-garlic lobster.

01:02:03.983 --> 01:02:06.076
I used to order that every time.

01:02:06.786 --> 01:02:08.117
I guess so.

01:02:11.324 --> 01:02:14.782
I checked out that website.

01:02:14.994 --> 01:02:17.155
Frozen Truth. It's impressive.

01:02:17.263 --> 01:02:20.061
Thanks. We work hard at it.

01:02:20.166 --> 01:02:23.158
Although, there was a bullshit blog

01:02:23.269 --> 01:02:26.761
blaming the current administration
for the entire mess that we're in.

01:02:26.873 --> 01:02:28.397
I don't think that's the truth.

01:02:28.508 --> 01:02:29.566
I agree with you.

01:02:29.743 --> 01:02:30.710
You do?

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:31.834
Yeah. Jack Salmon wrote it...

01:02:31.978 --> 01:02:32.967
Graydy.

01:02:33.079 --> 01:02:36.674
Congratulations. Great to see you.
You're doing great work down there.

01:02:37.083 --> 01:02:39.574
- Um. Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Gordon. Gordon Gekko.

01:02:39.719 --> 01:02:41.186
Nice to see you.
Thanks so much.

01:03:02.742 --> 01:03:04.573
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

01:03:17.957 --> 01:03:19.117
Winnie!

01:03:21.027 --> 01:03:22.358
Why did you make me do that, Jake?

01:03:22.462 --> 01:03:24.123
You don't understand.
This is none of your business.

01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:26.790
It is my business. Stop for a second.
Look at the real man in there.

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:28.765
He's hurting.
He's desperate to get you back in his life.

01:03:28.868 --> 01:03:30.802
He's not who you think he is, Jake!

01:03:30.904 --> 01:03:33.600
People change.
It was a long time ago. Winnie.

01:03:37.577 --> 01:03:39.374
He'll hurt us.

01:03:40.814 --> 01:03:42.782
Don't go back in there.

01:03:51.357 --> 01:03:53.188
Are we really going to lead
with this Babaco Solar?

01:03:53.793 --> 01:03:56.853
It's a hustle, Bretton.
I passed on it twice within the last two years.

01:03:56.963 --> 01:03:58.396
They spin a sexy story

01:03:58.498 --> 01:04:00.466
with these super-thin
cadmium telluride semiconductors,

01:04:00.567 --> 01:04:02.262
but the truth is,
the technology is not proprietary...

01:04:02.368 --> 01:04:04.836
We've been over this, Bretton.
You are unbelievable, Moore.

01:04:04.938 --> 01:04:06.599
Babaco is a cow.
It's dead in the water.

01:04:06.706 --> 01:04:08.435
The Chinese aren't stupid.
They're not going to go for it.

01:04:08.541 --> 01:04:09.508
Yeah, a cash cow maybe.

01:04:09.609 --> 01:04:11.736
They've been saying fusion
is five years away for the last 40 years.

01:04:11.845 --> 01:04:12.971
It is. Laser fusion is the future.

01:04:13.079 --> 01:04:14.307
Can you prove that, boy genius?

01:04:14.414 --> 01:04:16.814
Can you prove evolution, girl genius?
That seems to work, though, right?

01:04:16.916 --> 01:04:18.474
Look, knock it off.
Both of you.

01:04:18.585 --> 01:04:21.679
These guys are parking 15 billion
across the board in energy sectors

01:04:21.788 --> 01:04:23.779
and I want them here, okay?

01:04:23.890 --> 01:04:28.293
Carol's taking the lead on this.
Our recommend is Babaco. That's final.

01:04:31.931 --> 01:04:33.489
Go ahead.
I'll take you to dinner some other time.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.124
Oh, eat me, Moore.

01:04:35.902 --> 01:04:38.598
Babaco is at the forefront
of developing thin film technology

01:04:38.705 --> 01:04:42.038
to incorporate solar cells
into pliable plastic sheets.

01:04:42.141 --> 01:04:45.577
We believe that within the next few years
we can approach the 20% level,

01:04:45.678 --> 01:04:49.205
making it a perfect match for the
explosion of growth and energy needs,

01:04:49.315 --> 01:04:51.647
which, as you know, is growing at 40%.

01:04:52.819 --> 01:04:55.185
Thin film technology
is the breakthrough here.

01:04:55.889 --> 01:04:57.982
And in 2010,

01:04:58.324 --> 01:05:01.350
thin film is going to surpass
crystalline silicon.

01:05:01.728 --> 01:05:03.093
And that's about it.

01:05:06.299 --> 01:05:08.790
- Go ahead.
- So, with the world energy demand

01:05:08.902 --> 01:05:11.564
growing 40% in the next 20 years,

01:05:11.671 --> 01:05:13.639
we at Church believe, Mr. Xu,

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:17.039
that Babaco Solar
is a cutting-edge no-brainer.

01:05:17.644 --> 01:05:20.135
Good for a 20% return
in the next two years

01:05:20.246 --> 01:05:23.306
with a 30 to 40% upside
in the next five years.

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:26.109
Thank you, Miss Carol.

01:05:26.219 --> 01:05:30.918
Solar will make an important part
of our portfolio.

01:05:31.257 --> 01:05:36.217
But truthfully, we have seen
similar technology from another firm.

01:05:36.896 --> 01:05:39.524
As you know, China's demand

01:05:39.632 --> 01:05:43.500
will more than double
before my daughter turns 21.

01:05:43.803 --> 01:05:48.240
So we are looking for the next 100 years.

01:05:48.341 --> 01:05:51.970
Where even my grandson
can spend money.

01:05:52.078 --> 01:05:54.478
Do you have anything else
to present to us today?

01:05:54.814 --> 01:05:56.509
We've come a long way.

01:05:59.886 --> 01:06:00.875
Listen, Wang,

01:06:00.987 --> 01:06:05.014
now, we got a great new line
on this shale oil technology.

01:06:06.426 --> 01:06:09.554
Let's just dig a lot deeper for a price
that we think is a good one.

01:06:09.729 --> 01:06:12.391
We'll have a complete workup for you
by the end of the month.

01:06:12.498 --> 01:06:15.467
All right, Bretton.
That sounds promising.

01:06:15.568 --> 01:06:16.967
What about fusion?

01:06:17.971 --> 01:06:19.370
We happen to be working
with a company right now.

01:06:19.472 --> 01:06:22.839
It's got all the hardware in place.
Started by the Department of Energy.

01:06:22.942 --> 01:06:25.308
They share R&D facilities
with the University of California.

01:06:25.745 --> 01:06:29.146
It's got a market cap right now
of about a billion. No earnings.

01:06:29.248 --> 01:06:32.081
Fusion has been around a long time.

01:06:37.690 --> 01:06:38.884
<i>The simple of it is,</i>

01:06:38.992 --> 01:06:41.256
<i>it's using the intense energy
of some 200 laser beams</i>

01:06:41.361 --> 01:06:44.125
<i>focused on a single target
the size of a few grains of rice</i>

01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:45.822
filled with hydrogen fuel.

01:06:45.932 --> 01:06:48.264
So the idea being that
when that target combusts

01:06:48.501 --> 01:06:50.731
<i>it produces more energy than it took in.</i>

01:06:51.704 --> 01:06:54.730
All the tests they've done indicate
that they can use this ignition process

01:06:54.841 --> 01:06:57.537
to turn simple seawater into energy.

01:06:58.711 --> 01:07:01.077
<i>It's called
Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion</i>

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:03.273
<i>using the reaction
between hot water on the surface</i>

01:07:03.383 --> 01:07:05.817
<i>and cold water beneath
to power the lasers.</i>

01:07:06.085 --> 01:07:08.679
So what you wind up with
is unlimited clean energy.

01:07:08.788 --> 01:07:11.382
How do you contain the explosion?

01:07:11.491 --> 01:07:13.220
That's a secret
I can't really share with you right now.

01:07:13.326 --> 01:07:16.056
Not to be secretive, but I could
probably get you in there for a peek.

01:07:16.162 --> 01:07:18.562
Maybe next week,
on your way back to Beijing from DC?

01:07:21.167 --> 01:07:22.964
Mr. Wang, I got you something.

01:07:23.169 --> 01:07:25.103
This is American baijiu.

01:07:28.842 --> 01:07:30.831
Whoa! Thank you.

01:07:30.943 --> 01:07:32.433
- Miss Chung, this is for you.
- Oh, thank you.

01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:42.315
I used to go with Zabel to China.

01:07:42.422 --> 01:07:45.858
Their culture's as much about manners
as it is about business.

01:07:45.958 --> 01:07:48.153
They're on the hook, Jake.
That's all I care about.

01:07:48.361 --> 01:07:49.350
Good.

01:07:49.796 --> 01:07:51.661
I'll send him some bamboo flowers,

01:07:51.764 --> 01:07:54.494
symbolizing continued growth and prosperity.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:58.536
You don't always listen so good, Jake,
but you got fight in you.

01:07:58.638 --> 01:08:00.003
I like that.

01:08:13.453 --> 01:08:16.115
I think you might just have
something on James.

01:08:16.221 --> 01:08:20.625
My friend in Switzerland, he confirmed
that this Locust Fund, it exists and it's big.

01:08:21.127 --> 01:08:22.754
- A billion dollars.
- Mmm-hmm?

01:08:23.763 --> 01:08:25.856
It just might be our friend Bretton

01:08:25.965 --> 01:08:29.196
was trading through his own account,
outside of Churchill Schwartz.

01:08:29.836 --> 01:08:31.770
Can we get that on the record?

01:08:31.871 --> 01:08:33.667
That's the hard part, isn't it?

01:08:37.676 --> 01:08:40.908
So what are we going to do
about my daughter, Jake?

01:08:41.514 --> 01:08:44.608
I told you, I'm sorry about the other night.
Gordon, I can't control her, you know?

01:08:44.783 --> 01:08:45.841
Yeah.

01:08:46.519 --> 01:08:51.752
You know, they say parents are the bones
on which children sharpen their teeth.

01:08:53.225 --> 01:08:55.694
Find another way for me to get with her.
You know, there's got to be...

01:08:55.795 --> 01:08:57.956
That dinner that's coming up,
all the Street guys are going?

01:08:58.064 --> 01:09:01.591
- The Alzheimer's thing at the Met.
- Yeah. I'm taking her.

01:09:02.033 --> 01:09:04.468
I wish I had 10K for a seat.

01:09:04.569 --> 01:09:07.163
A writer's got to sell
a lot of books for that.

01:09:08.541 --> 01:09:11.135
And we both know how Winnie
would react to the fact

01:09:11.243 --> 01:09:14.475
that you've been bonding
with your future father-in-law.

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:16.171
Is that a threat?

01:09:17.383 --> 01:09:18.714
Absolutely.

01:09:19.318 --> 01:09:20.478
Huh.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.045
Well, consider it done.

01:09:23.156 --> 01:09:25.818
I just got to put you at another table.
It's got to look like an accident.

01:09:26.725 --> 01:09:28.125
I like trading with you, Jake.

01:09:28.828 --> 01:09:30.658
See you around campus.

01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:33.455
Hey.

01:09:33.866 --> 01:09:35.857
Get her a ring, for Christ's sake!

01:09:59.325 --> 01:10:00.314
How are you, Bill?

01:10:00.426 --> 01:10:01.950
Julie, how nice to see you.

01:10:02.061 --> 01:10:04.359
Well, it's a pleasure to see you, William.

01:10:04.463 --> 01:10:06.192
So nice to see you.

01:10:07.633 --> 01:10:09.931
Have you spoken to J.P.
about the conservancy?

01:10:18.311 --> 01:10:19.642
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

01:10:19.745 --> 01:10:22.646
Congratulations.
Looks like you won this one.

01:10:24.217 --> 01:10:25.980
- Hi.
- It's not over yet.

01:10:26.686 --> 01:10:28.483
- Have you met Jake?
- Good to see you. How's your husband?

01:10:28.588 --> 01:10:29.612
Very well.

01:10:31.958 --> 01:10:33.983
I gotta tell you, Mr. Gekko,

01:10:34.093 --> 01:10:36.721
seeing you speak was inspirational
on so many levels.

01:10:36.829 --> 01:10:38.319
Because, I'll tell you,
I'm on the outside.

01:10:38.431 --> 01:10:40.899
I'm looking at all my buddies
making all this money

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.262
and I'm thinking, "Fellas,

01:10:42.368 --> 01:10:45.098
"there's no there, there." You know?

01:10:45.204 --> 01:10:47.365
But listen, I'm at your table.
We can talk about this all night.

01:10:47.473 --> 01:10:50.033
That's great, Robby.
I'll see you later then, all right?

01:10:50.142 --> 01:10:51.507
Hey, Gordon.

01:10:52.912 --> 01:10:54.504
Looking good.

01:10:54.614 --> 01:10:55.774
My God.

01:10:56.782 --> 01:11:00.183
Bud Fox, huh?
I haven't seen you in years.

01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:02.351
This is Erin and Christina.

01:11:02.455 --> 01:11:04.082
- Hi.
- Hello. Hi.

01:11:04.857 --> 01:11:08.520
What was that airline called?
Blue Star, that's right.

01:11:08.628 --> 01:11:11.188
That must be keeping you
pretty busy now, huh?

01:11:12.331 --> 01:11:13.628
Excuse me.

01:11:15.268 --> 01:11:19.204
Well, after a little time away,
I actually turned it into

01:11:19.305 --> 01:11:24.072
one of the largest private jet brokerages
in the world and sold it. Made millions.

01:11:24.176 --> 01:11:27.270
That's great, pal. That's really great.
So what's up next?

01:11:28.347 --> 01:11:30.542
You're looking at it. Golf,

01:11:31.117 --> 01:11:34.553
winters in St. Barts, philanthropy.

01:11:35.021 --> 01:11:37.114
- Ah!
- And how about you, Gordon?

01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:41.217
Does Blue Horseshoe
still love Anacott Steel?

01:11:41.327 --> 01:11:43.557
You know it.

01:11:45.798 --> 01:11:47.857
Well, I'll see you around sometime, Gordon.

01:11:49.068 --> 01:11:50.797
Stay out of trouble.

01:12:45.358 --> 01:12:47.349
And the website's called Frozen Truth.

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:48.757
- Frozen Truth?
- Yeah.

01:12:48.861 --> 01:12:50.920
That's catchy. I like that.

01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:53.897
What we really need
is some game-changing news.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.561
And now you can come out of nowhere
with one big story.

01:12:57.670 --> 01:12:59.934
Since "Mission Accomplished"
broke the Senator's affair,

01:13:00.039 --> 01:13:02.064
they've gotten 200,000 hits a day.

01:13:02.875 --> 01:13:04.103
Is it expensive to run?

01:13:04.210 --> 01:13:05.734
Not really.
It's a shoestring budget.

01:13:07.013 --> 01:13:09.243
Maybe Jake can find ways
to raise you some money

01:13:09.348 --> 01:13:10.747
flip it to the public?

01:13:11.517 --> 01:13:14.281
We don't really want to go public.
It would affect our credibility.

01:13:14.387 --> 01:13:15.752
We want to stay non-profit.

01:13:16.022 --> 01:13:18.149
Non-profit? What is that?
I don't know what that is.

01:13:18.257 --> 01:13:20.885
- I've heard the term before, "non-profit."
- That's very funny.

01:13:20.993 --> 01:13:23.587
You know what it is?
Isn't that when you came out of school

01:13:23.696 --> 01:13:25.994
and you had to do something for the government,
like it was mandatory?

01:13:26.098 --> 01:13:28.430
- Very funny.
- It was called the draft.

01:13:28.534 --> 01:13:29.796
- It was called the draft.
- It's called the draft.

01:13:29.902 --> 01:13:31.665
So one day, Brett, Churchill Schwartz

01:13:31.771 --> 01:13:34.638
is going to buy every table
at this jackal's ball.

01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:37.436
They're going to call it
"a religious revival."

01:13:39.578 --> 01:13:41.705
Winn, you don't have to leave
on my behalf.

01:13:41.814 --> 01:13:43.338
I'm only going to be here
a couple of seconds.

01:13:43.449 --> 01:13:45.212
No. Stay.
I'm just going to get some air.

01:13:58.264 --> 01:14:02.030
If somebody took this place out tonight,
there'd be nobody left to rule the world.

01:14:04.437 --> 01:14:08.237
But, Brett, congratulations.
I know how hard you worked for all of this.

01:14:08.707 --> 01:14:10.868
I go by "Bretton" these days.

01:14:11.577 --> 01:14:14.910
It's a beneficiary of a few bull markets.
That's all it takes.

01:14:15.081 --> 01:14:17.276
So easy, even a caveman can do it, right?

01:14:17.383 --> 01:14:18.577
That's right.

01:14:18.684 --> 01:14:21.983
You make modesty a virtue, Bretton.

01:14:22.555 --> 01:14:26.548
The truth is, nobody needs
inside information anymore to get rich.

01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:31.089
All you have to do is stay out of jail.

01:14:31.664 --> 01:14:33.427
- Glad to be here, Bretton.
- Herb.

01:14:33.566 --> 01:14:37.798
Actually, jail was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:14:37.903 --> 01:14:39.962
- Oh, yeah?
- Got me to think.

01:14:40.639 --> 01:14:42.231
It centers a man.

01:14:43.175 --> 01:14:45.939
I probably should thank
whoever put me in there.

01:14:49.515 --> 01:14:51.745
You know, I saw you on television
the other night.

01:14:52.618 --> 01:14:54.677
You are quite the bear.

01:14:55.521 --> 01:14:56.715
You be careful, you know.

01:14:56.822 --> 01:14:59.484
Your daughter's financial health
is now in our hands.

01:14:59.592 --> 01:15:01.958
- So it is, so it is.
- Yeah, it is.

01:15:02.061 --> 01:15:05.030
But your firm knows sub-primes are crap.

01:15:05.664 --> 01:15:09.464
The way you keep buying
Bernie's insurance swaps lately,

01:15:09.568 --> 01:15:13.527
I mean, I gotta worry about
my grandchildren's college education.

01:15:14.607 --> 01:15:17.098
- We like insurance.
- What's not to like?

01:15:17.643 --> 01:15:20.806
Easy selling crack to kids
in a school playground.

01:15:21.013 --> 01:15:23.846
Credit default swap is a good idea.
It's the execution that isn't.

01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:26.843
Well, you know what they say.

01:15:26.952 --> 01:15:31.321
Bulls make money, bears make money,
and the pigs, they get slaughtered.

01:15:31.624 --> 01:15:34.115
I thought this was a charity event, Gordon.

01:15:34.226 --> 01:15:36.592
Why don't you go find some?

01:15:37.663 --> 01:15:40.564
Tell you what.
I'll make you a deal, Bretton.

01:15:41.267 --> 01:15:45.499
You stop telling lies about me,
I'll stop telling the truth about you.

01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:56.670
That's sad.

01:15:57.683 --> 01:15:59.742
- Isn't it?
- It's pathetic.

01:15:59.852 --> 01:16:02.112
That he can't just take his ball
and go home.

01:16:02.221 --> 01:16:04.587
He has to piss on the whole game.

01:16:07.293 --> 01:16:10.490
- I'm going to go find Winnie.
- Oh, look, by the way,

01:16:11.330 --> 01:16:13.195
I talked to Wang today.

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:18.600
I think the Chinese are close.
Very close.

01:16:19.605 --> 01:16:21.971
In any case, I want to talk to you
about the future,

01:16:22.074 --> 01:16:24.042
about how we're going
to bring this over the top.

01:16:24.143 --> 01:16:25.371
- Sure.
- Okay?

01:16:25.477 --> 01:16:27.206
- Tomorrow?
- Possibly tomorrow.

01:16:27.313 --> 01:16:28.541
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

01:16:36.055 --> 01:16:37.044
Hi.

01:16:45.297 --> 01:16:47.265
He's a good kid.

01:16:47.366 --> 01:16:49.732
He came from nothing.

01:16:49.835 --> 01:16:51.928
Hustler, like me.

01:16:55.641 --> 01:16:58.201
You think he's the one for you, Winn?

01:16:58.911 --> 01:16:59.935
Yep.

01:17:02.181 --> 01:17:04.172
Well, just make sure he's worthy of you

01:17:04.283 --> 01:17:07.878
because, whether you like it or not,
you're still a Gekko.

01:17:10.656 --> 01:17:12.681
And whether you like it or not

01:17:12.791 --> 01:17:15.453
that name doesn't mean anything anymore.

01:17:18.697 --> 01:17:21.165
Why do you say something like that?

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:23.834
We had an agreement.

01:17:23.936 --> 01:17:27.235
You remember?
Last time you came down to see me?

01:17:27.339 --> 01:17:29.432
We were going to take a little trip.

01:17:29.541 --> 01:17:32.704
When I got out, you remember that?
To Switzerland?

01:17:33.012 --> 01:17:34.445
Yeah.

01:17:34.546 --> 01:17:36.309
That was before Rudy.

01:17:40.953 --> 01:17:44.389
Some of the things that came out
after you went away,

01:17:46.325 --> 01:17:49.226
things you were recorded saying,
the affairs?

01:17:50.629 --> 01:17:53.359
That wasn't you. That wasn't my father.
It was some sociopath.

01:17:53.465 --> 01:17:55.057
- It was nine years ago.
- So?

01:17:55.167 --> 01:17:56.691
When are you going to stop?

01:18:02.675 --> 01:18:05.872
You got no idea what hell
I went through in there.

01:18:05.978 --> 01:18:08.503
Hell, for you?
It was hell for you?

01:18:08.614 --> 01:18:12.516
Do you know what you did to Rudy?
To all of us? You drove Mom mad.

01:18:12.618 --> 01:18:13.607
Winnie,

01:18:14.486 --> 01:18:16.181
he was my only son.

01:18:19.158 --> 01:18:21.922
I tried everything.
I put him in the 12-step deal.

01:18:22.027 --> 01:18:24.962
I never told you,
I borrowed money from hardcore guys.

01:18:25.064 --> 01:18:27.828
Tens of thousands of dollars,
which I didn't have.

01:18:28.734 --> 01:18:31.669
I gave it to the best therapist I could find.

01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:36.739
I even tried to pay off one scumbag dealer
not to sell any more to my boy!

01:18:38.577 --> 01:18:40.841
But if you'd been there, Dad...

01:18:43.349 --> 01:18:46.079
If you hadn't been in prison,

01:18:46.385 --> 01:18:48.444
it would've been different.

01:18:49.955 --> 01:18:53.015
Winnie, you got no idea

01:18:53.292 --> 01:18:55.920
how much I beat myself up,

01:18:56.028 --> 01:18:58.588
how many mistakes I made as a father.

01:18:59.898 --> 01:19:01.263
Rudy...

01:19:02.067 --> 01:19:04.297
He was a victim, you know.
Like, he had cancer.

01:19:04.403 --> 01:19:06.132
You cannot blame me.

01:19:07.673 --> 01:19:10.164
And you gotta stop blaming yourself.

01:19:21.086 --> 01:19:23.247
You're all I got left, honey.

01:19:25.224 --> 01:19:26.589
Nothing else

01:19:27.893 --> 01:19:29.087
matters.

01:19:32.498 --> 01:19:36.161
I cannot make it right again,
but I can make things better.

01:19:38.837 --> 01:19:39.997
I'm your dad.

01:19:41.607 --> 01:19:44.804
And whatever you say
till the day that I die,

01:19:46.278 --> 01:19:47.745
you're my gal.

01:19:49.581 --> 01:19:51.310
You're the only one.

01:19:52.351 --> 01:19:53.841
You're my baby.

01:19:58.924 --> 01:20:00.357
Please.

01:20:01.527 --> 01:20:05.019
Winnie, just try to forgive me.

01:20:20.179 --> 01:20:21.203
Dad.

01:20:39.965 --> 01:20:40.989
It's done, Doc.

01:20:41.166 --> 01:20:43.430
Look, you're an older guy,
so I don't want you to have a heart attack.

01:20:43.535 --> 01:20:46.663
But Bretton James just said
we're gonna get $100 million!

01:20:46.772 --> 01:20:48.831
- <i>Are you serious, my boy?</i>
- Yes!

01:20:48.941 --> 01:20:50.738
Bretton says the Chinese are close!

01:20:50.943 --> 01:20:53.241
But look, you get some sleep, all right?
You deserve it.

01:20:53.345 --> 01:20:56.109
- <i>Thank you, Jacob.</i>
- I'll talk to you soon.

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:37.480
<i>There is carnage on Wall Street.</i>

01:21:37.589 --> 01:21:40.217
<i>The shares of the major
financial stocks plummeting.</i>

01:21:40.325 --> 01:21:42.919
<i>It's triggering a major sell-off
in the markets.</i>

01:21:43.028 --> 01:21:44.290
<i>The damage, widespread.</i>

01:21:44.396 --> 01:21:45.385
<i>The NASDAQ's plunging.</i>

01:21:45.497 --> 01:21:48.227
<i>The Dow Jones Industrial Average
is plunging, and oil is plunging.</i>

01:21:48.634 --> 01:21:50.465
<i>Literally a 180 points
just added to the decline.</i>

01:21:50.969 --> 01:21:52.368
<i>You can hear the hollering
on the floor.</i>

01:21:52.471 --> 01:21:55.406
<i>We're down 260,
literally in a split second.</i>

01:21:55.507 --> 01:21:57.270
<i>Right now,
the Dow Jones Industrial Average</i>

01:21:57.376 --> 01:22:00.038
<i>is now 500 points on the decline.</i>

01:22:00.345 --> 01:22:02.313
<i>The headline of the
new housing report is grim</i>

01:22:02.481 --> 01:22:06.247
<i>that this is shaping up to be
the worst real estate market in a generation.</i>

01:22:06.351 --> 01:22:08.285
<i>We are now at the highest point there, 724.</i>

01:22:08.387 --> 01:22:10.378
<i>That was the biggest loss
we've seen today.</i>

01:22:10.489 --> 01:22:12.252
<i>We're now in historic territory.</i>

01:22:12.357 --> 01:22:14.791
<i>Investors are getting
their heads handed to them</i>

01:22:14.893 --> 01:22:17.919
<i>as another US banking institution
nears collapse.</i>

01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:20.828
<i>The President's Working Group
is going into emergency meetings</i>

01:22:20.933 --> 01:22:23.993
<i>with the Secretary of the Treasury
and the Federal Reserve Board.</i>

01:22:32.377 --> 01:22:35.869
The President's Chief of Staff
is calling back in an hour.

01:22:35.981 --> 01:22:37.278
He's with the President.

01:22:37.382 --> 01:22:40.909
And he's going to want to know
what I think we should do.

01:22:41.853 --> 01:22:44.117
This isn't Keller Zabel, Bill.

01:22:46.124 --> 01:22:48.251
This is too big to fail.

01:22:48.427 --> 01:22:51.590
- This is just an insane situation.
- This is now.

01:22:51.697 --> 01:22:54.723
There's about 70-plus trillion out there
in credit default swaps

01:22:54.833 --> 01:22:56.164
held by roughly 17 banks.

01:22:56.268 --> 01:22:58.429
And we do not know where the bottom is.

01:22:59.972 --> 01:23:02.270
How much are you guys thinking?

01:23:02.374 --> 01:23:04.342
At least five.

01:23:04.443 --> 01:23:06.468
I think six.

01:23:06.578 --> 01:23:09.809
Bill, I frankly think
Harry and Charlie are low.

01:23:09.915 --> 01:23:12.042
I think we're talking seven, eight.

01:23:12.184 --> 01:23:13.742
Hundred billion?

01:23:19.925 --> 01:23:21.654
Selling this to Congress
is the problem.

01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:24.626
They're going to want to know
where the money's going.

01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:26.925
They'll jawbone this to death.

01:23:29.968 --> 01:23:31.560
- Scare them.
- How?

01:23:32.471 --> 01:23:34.200
Tell them the truth.

01:23:34.806 --> 01:23:37.741
The government's got to restore confidence.

01:23:37.876 --> 01:23:40.709
If we don't stop the bleeding,
in three days,

01:23:40.812 --> 01:23:43.406
half the banks in this room
are out of business.

01:23:43.515 --> 01:23:45.881
And in five days, we're all gone.

01:23:47.719 --> 01:23:50.313
You men realize what you've done here?

01:23:52.457 --> 01:23:57.121
You are asking for the biggest bailout
in the history of this country.

01:23:58.196 --> 01:24:00.892
You're talking nationalization, Bretton.

01:24:01.733 --> 01:24:03.064
Socialism.

01:24:05.671 --> 01:24:09.402
I have fought it all my life.

01:24:10.575 --> 01:24:12.975
And if we don't get it, Bill,

01:24:13.211 --> 01:24:15.270
there won't be any history.

01:24:15.781 --> 01:24:17.146
Music stops.

01:24:18.650 --> 01:24:20.015
Ball's over.

01:24:24.056 --> 01:24:25.182
Julie?

01:24:26.958 --> 01:24:28.391
1929.

01:24:30.529 --> 01:24:33.430
It'll get worse now,
because it'll go faster.

01:24:34.266 --> 01:24:38.862
Money markets will dry up around the world
by the end of the week.

01:24:39.004 --> 01:24:41.939
ATMs will stop spitting bills.

01:24:43.508 --> 01:24:46.204
Federal Deposit Insurance will collapse.

01:24:47.112 --> 01:24:49.080
Banks will close.

01:24:49.314 --> 01:24:50.872
Mobs, panic.

01:24:54.486 --> 01:24:57.580
It's going to be the end of the world, Bill.

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:03.084
See?

01:25:07.232 --> 01:25:08.324
Huh!

01:25:10.102 --> 01:25:11.660
All right, boys.

01:25:12.871 --> 01:25:14.964
You'll hear from us tonight.

01:25:18.777 --> 01:25:19.766
<i>What is going to happen here?</i>

01:25:19.878 --> 01:25:20.867
<i>Does government have to get involved?</i>

01:25:20.979 --> 01:25:23.379
<i>Are we potentially at a point
where we might actually lose</i>

01:25:23.482 --> 01:25:25.382
<i>the financial system as we know it?</i>

01:25:25.484 --> 01:25:27.452
<i>If the government doesn't get involved,</i>

01:25:27.552 --> 01:25:30.817
<i>there is a risk of a global meltdown
of the global financial system.</i>

01:25:30.922 --> 01:25:32.184
<i>This is a financial crisis,</i>

01:25:32.290 --> 01:25:35.259
<i>and anyone who doesn't admit that
is just kidding themselves.</i>

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.759
- <i>We've seen something like this.</i>
- <i>Polly, I disagree.</i>

01:25:36.862 --> 01:25:39.592
<i>You've gotta get the government to say no
in a situation like this.</i>

01:25:39.698 --> 01:25:42.394
<i>True capitalism is about
disaster and correction.</i>

01:25:42.501 --> 01:25:43.729
<i>It's a natural cycle.</i>

01:25:43.835 --> 01:25:45.302
<i>Without it, you create all kinds</i>

01:25:45.403 --> 01:25:47.701
- <i>of artificial anomalies in the market.</i>
- <i>But if we don't fix this now,</i>

01:25:47.806 --> 01:25:49.296
<i>you're going to have...</i>

01:25:49.407 --> 01:25:52.467
<i>This is something this country
hasn't experienced before.</i>

01:25:52.644 --> 01:25:54.339
<i>It's an economic Pearl Harbor.</i>

01:25:54.446 --> 01:25:56.175
<i>We got to figure out some way
to put the fire out.</i>

01:25:56.281 --> 01:25:58.374
<i>And that means government...</i>

01:26:03.789 --> 01:26:05.848
Your father predicted this.

01:26:09.127 --> 01:26:10.253
When I was little,

01:26:11.062 --> 01:26:13.963
I'd hear my dad in the kitchen
late at night.

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:16.726
His case was on appeal.

01:26:19.571 --> 01:26:22.472
I'd go and sit with him.
We'd eat ice cream.

01:26:24.109 --> 01:26:26.304
I never knew him as a peaceful person.

01:26:28.713 --> 01:26:30.442
It always scared me.

01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:33.017
This is scary.

01:26:34.286 --> 01:26:36.151
What's going to happen?

01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:40.017
It'll be the end.

01:26:44.029 --> 01:26:46.020
Well, that's unacceptable.

01:26:47.499 --> 01:26:48.659
Why?

01:26:49.701 --> 01:26:51.362
Because I'm pregnant, Jake.

01:27:02.047 --> 01:27:03.912
- You're pregnant?
- Yeah.

01:27:09.287 --> 01:27:13.246
<i>When the lake's on fire</i>

01:27:13.358 --> 01:27:14.950
That's fantastic.

01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:18.427
<i>With all the world's desires</i>

01:27:19.130 --> 01:27:22.224
<i>Compact, relaxed</i>

01:27:23.835 --> 01:27:27.931
<i>Intact, give thanks</i>

01:27:28.607 --> 01:27:34.637
<i>I'm counting all the possibilities</i>

01:27:39.217 --> 01:27:42.015
<i>And we are talking on the S&P 500</i>

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:44.850
<i>a loss of almost eight percent in one day,</i>

01:27:44.956 --> 01:27:47.481
<i>surpassing September 17th, 2001.</i>

01:27:47.592 --> 01:27:50.925
<i>That's the day markets opened
after the attacks of 9/11.</i>

01:27:51.029 --> 01:27:52.462
<i>...last night on Wall Street</i>

01:27:52.564 --> 01:27:55.465
<i>and swept through
Japan, China, India and Europe</i>

01:27:55.567 --> 01:27:59.697
<i>after one of the worst days
on global stock markets in modern times.</i>

01:28:44.349 --> 01:28:46.180
They said your office.

01:28:48.119 --> 01:28:51.350
It's too depressing today.
This is my other office.

01:28:52.924 --> 01:28:55.119
This might be dangerous.
Think you can keep up?

01:28:55.327 --> 01:28:57.386
World's crashing anyway.
We'll see, right?

01:30:20.612 --> 01:30:22.375
That's not bad, Jake.

01:30:23.148 --> 01:30:25.480
Though I think they might have
given you the faster bike.

01:30:25.583 --> 01:30:27.676
I'm sure that's what it was.

01:30:29.187 --> 01:30:30.415
You know,

01:30:31.122 --> 01:30:32.851
I've always believed
that a man should have,

01:30:32.957 --> 01:30:37.394
at one time or another in his life,
both a mentor and a protégé.

01:30:37.862 --> 01:30:38.886
Who's yours?

01:30:38.997 --> 01:30:41.022
The man who brought me
into Churchill Schwartz.

01:30:41.132 --> 01:30:45.535
Bill Clark at Treasury.
He's been a good friend to us during this crisis.

01:30:46.271 --> 01:30:48.739
You got the makings of a leader, Jake.

01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:52.207
I just want you to know,
there's no hard feelings on this.

01:30:52.977 --> 01:30:54.672
No one's going to lose.

01:30:54.779 --> 01:30:57.111
With Clark in,
I think we're in good shape.

01:30:57.215 --> 01:30:58.944
You got a great future.

01:30:59.050 --> 01:31:00.745
I don't understand.

01:31:01.252 --> 01:31:03.311
Didn't you read this morning's
capital breakdown?

01:31:03.421 --> 01:31:06.686
No, I came right up to the roof.
Why? What happened?

01:31:08.326 --> 01:31:14.162
Look, the Chinese money,
it's going to Babaco Solar.

01:31:16.267 --> 01:31:18.201
- What?
- We took another look

01:31:18.303 --> 01:31:20.999
and we just don't think United Fusion
is ever gonna achieve what they claim.

01:31:21.106 --> 01:31:23.438
Babaco needs this money to build
these three fabrications...

01:31:23.541 --> 01:31:24.803
You might as well
just burn the money, Bretton.

01:31:24.909 --> 01:31:27.241
You told me, I told Dr. Masters.
He's expecting it.

01:31:27.345 --> 01:31:29.370
The decision's been made.

01:31:29.481 --> 01:31:31.472
Unless you want it to die.

01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:37.144
Of course. Seawater is in a lot more supply
than crude. Right, Bretton?

01:31:37.255 --> 01:31:40.418
- You an idealist or a capitalist, Jacob?
- I'm a realist.

01:31:41.259 --> 01:31:43.284
You're a real piece of work, Bretton.

01:31:43.394 --> 01:31:45.555
You're giving the money to Babaco
because it's a hustle.

01:31:45.663 --> 01:31:48.530
It's all inside. That's why
your oil companies are safe, right?

01:31:48.633 --> 01:31:53.593
The mentor-protégé relationship
is not emotional over anything.

01:31:54.606 --> 01:31:57.200
I thought you might be a good addition
to the Churchill Schwartz team.

01:31:57.308 --> 01:31:58.900
- Am I mistaken?
- Let me tell you something, Bretton.

01:31:59.010 --> 01:32:02.275
You are not my mentor. Lou Zabel was.
And whether you admit it or not,

01:32:02.514 --> 01:32:05.449
your raid destroyed Zabel
and forced him to suicide.

01:32:05.550 --> 01:32:09.145
So you may talk about moral hazard.
You are the moral hazard.

01:32:09.621 --> 01:32:13.580
You are the worst kind of toxic debt
this system's polluted with.

01:32:15.426 --> 01:32:17.656
- Is this a threat?
- Absolutely.

01:32:25.870 --> 01:32:27.861
This is so disappointing.

01:32:28.806 --> 01:32:31.274
I really saw so much in you, Jacob.

01:32:32.944 --> 01:32:37.677
You should look in the mirror first.
See yourself. It might scare you, Bretton.

01:32:42.353 --> 01:32:44.446
Consider the motorcycle
part of your severance.

01:32:44.556 --> 01:32:46.183
Fuck you, Bretton!

01:32:52.997 --> 01:32:54.362
- Here you are.
- Thanks a lot.

01:32:54.465 --> 01:32:56.660
- Hi. For Elise.
- "For Elise."

01:32:56.768 --> 01:32:59.635
- And can I ask you a question, Mr. Gekko?
- Certainly, Elise.

01:32:59.737 --> 01:33:02.069
What exactly is "moral hazard"?

01:33:02.173 --> 01:33:04.300
- He screwed me.
- Excuse me?

01:33:05.476 --> 01:33:06.534
Shocker.

01:33:06.644 --> 01:33:09.841
He saw that fusion was actually possible,
so he killed it.

01:33:09.948 --> 01:33:12.007
Well, that's a little far-fetched.

01:33:12.116 --> 01:33:14.516
But then, these days,
anything is possible.

01:33:14.619 --> 01:33:16.382
Well, I quit, Gordon.

01:33:17.121 --> 01:33:21.023
That's really going to help.
I'll see you outside in 15 minutes.

01:33:21.226 --> 01:33:24.218
Moral hazard, that's when somebody

01:33:24.329 --> 01:33:27.355
takes your money
and is not responsible for it.

01:33:28.433 --> 01:33:32.301
This guy James,
he must walk between raindrops.

01:33:32.403 --> 01:33:34.963
He's a monkey dancing on a razorblade.

01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:40.502
Not only did he start the rumors at Zabel
to get your bank for peanuts,

01:33:40.612 --> 01:33:43.274
the guy was trading for his own account
in this Locust Fund.

01:33:43.381 --> 01:33:44.678
- He was?
- He was.

01:33:44.816 --> 01:33:48.650
And he was betting against the market
that he was making.

01:33:48.753 --> 01:33:52.553
But the kicker is, so was his firm.

01:33:52.657 --> 01:33:55.091
Churchill Schwartz was shorting sub-primes?

01:33:55.193 --> 01:33:58.060
Yeah, for the last two years
they've been hedging.

01:33:58.162 --> 01:34:01.893
Not just sub-primes.
Primes, indexes, the whole thing.

01:34:03.501 --> 01:34:07.733
But they knew this home loan fantasy
was going to collapse the market.

01:34:08.806 --> 01:34:10.797
And when they did, they got the Feds

01:34:10.908 --> 01:34:15.811
to bail out their bad insurance swaps,
a 100 cents on the dollar.

01:34:16.014 --> 01:34:19.541
I mean, talk about an evil empire.
This puts me to shame.

01:34:19.817 --> 01:34:22.718
And I'm small-time
compared to these crooks.

01:34:24.522 --> 01:34:27.821
The system is insolvent
if no one knows what to do next,

01:34:27.925 --> 01:34:31.326
except repeat the insanity
till the next bubble blows.

01:34:32.463 --> 01:34:34.761
That'll be the one.
The big one.

01:34:35.833 --> 01:34:38.825
The tipping point, just like the tulip.

01:34:38.936 --> 01:34:42.736
We could still go after James on this.
Just bring it all out.

01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:44.569
Easy, Trigger.

01:34:44.676 --> 01:34:48.134
Media is not going to get in the way
of Churchill or the government.

01:34:48.246 --> 01:34:51.010
They want their profits
just like the rest of us.

01:34:51.115 --> 01:34:53.174
It's unethical, but it's not illegal.

01:34:53.284 --> 01:34:56.742
When everyone's running for the lifeboats,
who's going to care?

01:34:56.854 --> 01:34:59.379
Maybe some little leftist website?

01:34:59.490 --> 01:35:01.151
Your daughter will run it.
It'll get some play.

01:35:06.631 --> 01:35:10.863
Look, Bretton is not an enemy
a kid like you wants to have for life.

01:35:10.968 --> 01:35:12.094
Just get out of this racket.

01:35:12.770 --> 01:35:15.898
Settle down with Winnie.
Live a happy life somewhere.

01:35:16.007 --> 01:35:19.033
- What?
- Well, you know, she's got enough money.

01:35:19.143 --> 01:35:21.134
- What do you mean?
- You're smart.

01:35:21.245 --> 01:35:22.769
You'll come up with another way
to slice bread.

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:25.440
- What money?
- My money.

01:35:27.151 --> 01:35:29.415
Stop playing it dumb, will you, Jake?
I know you know.

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:30.817
Know what?

01:35:32.223 --> 01:35:33.918
Are you telling me
that you're not the only one

01:35:34.058 --> 01:35:36.652
in this relationship keeping a secret?

01:35:38.863 --> 01:35:40.490
Hold on a second.
What money, Gordon?

01:35:42.333 --> 01:35:44.699
- Switzerland.
- How much?

01:35:46.671 --> 01:35:49.504
It's close to $100 million by now.

01:35:54.078 --> 01:35:56.308
What do you say we split a cab?

01:36:02.587 --> 01:36:06.887
I set it up as a Swiss account in the '80s
before all the trouble.

01:36:06.991 --> 01:36:08.015
Hey, chief.

01:36:08.259 --> 01:36:10.693
Look, I'll pay you extra.
Just slow down.

01:36:10.795 --> 01:36:12.023
Can you... Can you...

01:36:12.130 --> 01:36:16.396
When she was 18, I told her she would come
into it all when she turned 25.

01:36:17.635 --> 01:36:20.399
And she agreed to stake me
when I got out.

01:36:21.406 --> 01:36:24.842
Then Rudy died, and she reneged.

01:36:25.143 --> 01:36:26.508
She never visited me again.

01:36:27.545 --> 01:36:29.410
She told me she had a small trust

01:36:29.514 --> 01:36:31.277
from you and her mom,
but she didn't care anything about it.

01:36:31.382 --> 01:36:33.509
She was going to give it to charity
when she was 25.

01:36:33.618 --> 01:36:35.882
Well, it's easy for her to say.
She never earned it.

01:36:37.388 --> 01:36:40.448
And now you want it
for your fusion delusion.

01:36:40.558 --> 01:36:44.119
But it's a trust. I mean, she couldn't break
into it before she was 25 anyway.

01:36:44.228 --> 01:36:47.254
Are you as dumb as you sound?
Anything can be revoked.

01:36:47.365 --> 01:36:51.563
They don't got trusts in Switzerland.
It's an account, that's all.

01:36:52.069 --> 01:36:54.867
I know the bank well.
They'll work with me.

01:36:55.573 --> 01:36:58.303
But you still need her signature, of course.

01:36:59.644 --> 01:37:04.013
When it comes to money, sport,
your eyes suddenly shine, just like mine.

01:37:06.851 --> 01:37:08.910
Great! Saved another life, huh?

01:37:09.821 --> 01:37:10.947
Asshole!

01:37:11.055 --> 01:37:12.989
Are you crazy?
You want to die? Huh?

01:37:17.795 --> 01:37:18.921
How do we do this?

01:37:21.566 --> 01:37:25.263
She goes with you to Switzerland,
she signs the account over to your control,

01:37:25.369 --> 01:37:28.202
then you give me the money
and I'll get it to the States for you.

01:37:29.006 --> 01:37:30.564
You mean launder it?

01:37:31.108 --> 01:37:33.338
Look, pal, you want the IRS on Winnie?

01:37:33.444 --> 01:37:37.505
Because you damn well know
she is complicit and seriously liable.

01:37:37.615 --> 01:37:39.082
All right? You want the money?

01:37:57.201 --> 01:37:58.463
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi.

01:37:58.569 --> 01:38:02.369
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah. I'll be back in a sec.

01:38:04.876 --> 01:38:07.777
Why didn't you tell me
about the $100 million?

01:38:11.215 --> 01:38:15.675
How did you find...
How did you find out in the first place?

01:38:15.987 --> 01:38:17.420
Did you talk to my father?

01:38:17.522 --> 01:38:19.717
I found out because Churchill Schwartz's
international trading desk

01:38:19.824 --> 01:38:21.451
handles some of the money,
and your name came up,

01:38:21.559 --> 01:38:22.651
along with Gordon Gekko.

01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:26.890
I never considered it mine.
I was 14. I was a minor when he set it up.

01:38:26.998 --> 01:38:28.090
Yeah, but you didn't do anything
with the money

01:38:28.199 --> 01:38:29.223
when you turned into a major, did you?

01:38:29.333 --> 01:38:31.233
- I was going to give it to charity.
- Really?

01:38:31.335 --> 01:38:33.826
What were you gonna do,
launder the money yourself, Winnie?

01:38:33.938 --> 01:38:37.203
- What was your plan?
- I didn't think about it.

01:38:37.308 --> 01:38:39.242
- You didn't think about it?
- It was my father's money.

01:38:39.343 --> 01:38:41.140
- You know how he got it.
- No, you're wrong. It's your money.

01:38:41.245 --> 01:38:43.907
It's $100 million of your money.

01:38:44.015 --> 01:38:45.482
Do you know what that means?

01:38:46.017 --> 01:38:49.851
That's five years in jail. You're gonna
get busted with him for tax fraud.

01:38:49.954 --> 01:38:51.888
This is serious, Winnie.

01:38:59.297 --> 01:39:02.164
You could do something good
with this money.

01:39:03.267 --> 01:39:05.098
This is more than just charity, Winn.

01:39:07.171 --> 01:39:10.402
You might want to wipe some of the drool
off your face, Jake.

01:39:10.942 --> 01:39:13.103
Winnie, if it wasn't important,
I'd totally understand, but it is.

01:39:13.210 --> 01:39:15.075
You know that fusion just might work.

01:39:15.179 --> 01:39:17.272
I know it sounds like <i>Star Wars,</i> love,

01:39:17.381 --> 01:39:19.872
but if it weren't for crazy people
who thought these crazy things,

01:39:19.984 --> 01:39:22.953
then where would we be in this world?
Nowhere.

01:39:23.521 --> 01:39:24.579
Huh?

01:39:25.056 --> 01:39:28.253
Winnie, Dr. Masters is a genius.
He's a pioneer.

01:39:28.359 --> 01:39:30.156
They might just solve this thing.
It could change the world.

01:39:30.261 --> 01:39:32.422
Yeah, okay.
Is this about changing the world or making money?

01:39:32.530 --> 01:39:34.088
Because you come into my office,
pitching to me.

01:39:34.198 --> 01:39:35.495
You sound like a Wall Street guy.

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:38.569
Hold on for a second!
I am a Wall Street guy.

01:39:38.669 --> 01:39:39.829
I am and I'm good at this.

01:39:39.937 --> 01:39:42.838
And I believe in this.
And you know that I do.

01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:45.204
What do you wanna do, just report
the news for the rest of your life

01:39:45.309 --> 01:39:47.004
or do you want to make the news?
This is your opportunity.

01:39:47.111 --> 01:39:49.375
It's your chance to shine.

01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:51.311
To be Captain America.

01:39:56.153 --> 01:39:59.816
This is the most charitable
you could ever be in your life!

01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:08.691
You honestly believe in this?

01:40:10.201 --> 01:40:13.796
Let's say I could... Let's say I could get
the money now, hypothetically, right?

01:40:13.904 --> 01:40:14.962
Not that you care about the money.

01:40:15.072 --> 01:40:16.334
But let's say I could take out
a loan against it,

01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:19.102
minimize your risk as much as possible.

01:40:20.144 --> 01:40:22.476
Would you do this for me, Winn?

01:40:24.882 --> 01:40:26.850
Would you do this for me?

01:40:53.177 --> 01:40:55.805
Very well, Miss Gekko.
We will have your father co-sign

01:40:55.913 --> 01:40:58.040
and we will see to it
that the funds are transferred.

01:40:58.149 --> 01:40:59.980
- Thank you.
- <i>Danke schon,</i> Miss Gekko.

01:41:00.418 --> 01:41:01.646
- Mr. Moore.
- Yes?

01:41:01.752 --> 01:41:05.347
Mr. Gekko asked that you call him in New York
as soon as this meeting is over.

01:41:05.456 --> 01:41:06.753
Thank you.

01:41:08.459 --> 01:41:10.689
So I'll take care of the rest of this.
You go back to the hotel.

01:41:10.795 --> 01:41:11.989
- All right.
- I just got the confirmation.

01:41:12.096 --> 01:41:13.563
We're on the direct flight to New York
in the morning.

01:41:13.664 --> 01:41:14.790
Great.

01:41:15.833 --> 01:41:17.130
- Great news on the loft.
- Oh, yeah?

01:41:17.234 --> 01:41:20.169
Yeah, I got a buyer.
So one less thing in our lives, right?

01:41:20.271 --> 01:41:22.739
- I kind of like the feeling.
- Yeah, so do I.

01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:25.104
- I'll see you over there.
- Okay.

01:41:33.851 --> 01:41:37.150
Hey, anyone can figure out life
when you're looking back on it.

01:41:37.254 --> 01:41:40.655
But we got to live it going forward.
Right, Jakie?

01:41:41.926 --> 01:41:45.384
Besides, four-and-a-half is great
in this market.

01:41:45.496 --> 01:41:48.329
Yeah, except I owe six to the bank.
When do I have to be out of here?

01:41:48.432 --> 01:41:50.559
You got three months more.

01:41:50.668 --> 01:41:54.229
By the way,
I had to throw in the furniture.

01:41:54.805 --> 01:41:56.602
What there was of it.

01:41:57.975 --> 01:42:00.068
Did you want me to have a yard sale
here for you?

01:42:01.312 --> 01:42:03.246
Here. Take it.
Here's your pen.

01:42:11.922 --> 01:42:14.322
- Jake...
- Dolores was just leaving.

01:42:15.226 --> 01:42:16.318
Oh.

01:42:20.397 --> 01:42:24.731
Hello to you, too, honey.
Don't forget. Three months, honey.

01:42:24.835 --> 01:42:25.961
Mmm-hmm.

01:42:30.207 --> 01:42:33.608
- Bastards changed the locks.
- You weren't servicing the loans, Ma.

01:42:33.711 --> 01:42:36.703
Well, they lied to me. They told me
they were going to give me more time.

01:42:36.814 --> 01:42:39.009
Well, they're not, okay?
They're panicking. Everyone is panicking.

01:42:39.116 --> 01:42:41.710
They're gonna throw it in the market
and take what they can get for it, Ma.

01:42:41.819 --> 01:42:43.946
But it's not even finished yet.

01:42:44.054 --> 01:42:46.716
And that's not all. Look.

01:42:46.824 --> 01:42:48.553
It's the other properties, Mom.

01:42:48.659 --> 01:42:50.991
No, but they said they were gonna give me
a little more time.

01:42:51.095 --> 01:42:52.653
And all I need is a 110 grand,

01:42:52.763 --> 01:42:55.857
and then that way,
I can keep all three properties in play.

01:42:55.966 --> 01:42:57.695
- I know you have it, Jake.
- I don't have it, Mom.

01:42:57.802 --> 01:42:59.235
- You have it, Jacob.
- I don't have it,

01:42:59.336 --> 01:43:00.894
and I wouldn't give it to you
if I did have it.

01:43:01.705 --> 01:43:04.071
- What am I supposed to do?
- You know what moral hazard is, Ma?

01:43:04.175 --> 01:43:05.267
- You know what that means?
- No.

01:43:05.376 --> 01:43:06.934
It means that once you get bailed out,
what's to stop you

01:43:07.044 --> 01:43:09.410
- from taking another shot?
- But I...

01:43:09.513 --> 01:43:11.538
I'm in trouble, Mom.
I am in trouble right now.

01:43:11.649 --> 01:43:14.049
I'm taking a huge hit on the loft,
I just sold my bike for nothing

01:43:14.151 --> 01:43:16.142
and now, again,
I'm writing you a check, Mom.

01:43:16.253 --> 01:43:17.652
- Oh.
- It's ridiculous.

01:43:18.889 --> 01:43:21.084
This is $30,000 that I barely have.

01:43:21.559 --> 01:43:23.322
- But that's not enough, honey.
- Ma, I love you,

01:43:23.427 --> 01:43:25.622
but I cannot keep hemorrhaging money
for your insanity.

01:43:25.729 --> 01:43:27.390
What you need to do
is you need to go back to Henry.

01:43:27.498 --> 01:43:28.897
You need to get another job, okay?

01:43:28.999 --> 01:43:32.366
But this is my job. I have a job.
What do you... Oh, my God.

01:43:32.469 --> 01:43:34.960
- You mean like a real job with a boss?
- Yes, a real job.

01:43:35.072 --> 01:43:36.596
- I'm too old to get a...
- I'm sorry, Ma,

01:43:36.707 --> 01:43:37.765
you got to start at some point.

01:43:37.875 --> 01:43:39.866
You got to start now.
I can't keep carrying you forever.

01:43:41.278 --> 01:43:44.179
You're not the only one
who's in trouble, Ma. Please.

01:43:44.281 --> 01:43:45.205
Hello?

01:43:45.216 --> 01:43:47.611
<i>Hey, Jake.
We have a problem.</i>

01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:50.244
Go ahead.

01:43:50.354 --> 01:43:54.120
I don't know what happened.
My CFO says the money hasn't arrived yet.

01:43:56.393 --> 01:43:58.088
Yeah, but it was sent yesterday.

01:43:58.195 --> 01:44:00.823
It should have been there
before the Fedwire closed at 6:00.

01:44:01.699 --> 01:44:05.499
Well, maybe there's been some sort of mistake.
It was a large amount.

01:44:08.405 --> 01:44:09.633
Okay, just sit tight.

01:44:09.974 --> 01:44:12.374
- <i>All right?</i>
- Jesus.

01:44:19.216 --> 01:44:21.912
A few days?
In this city that's nothing.

01:44:23.053 --> 01:44:25.317
Mr. Gekko is good tenant.

01:44:25.923 --> 01:44:27.481
I appreciate it.

01:44:48.245 --> 01:44:52.477
<i>A fisherman always sees
another fisherman from afar.</i>

01:44:59.056 --> 01:45:01.957
<i>Winnie's all I got left.
You understand that?</i>

01:45:04.228 --> 01:45:05.456
<i>How much?</i>

01:45:05.663 --> 01:45:08.097
Close to $100 million by now.

01:45:10.734 --> 01:45:12.895
Don't go back in there, Jake.

01:45:16.307 --> 01:45:17.934
This is who he is.

01:45:20.711 --> 01:45:22.474
I did tell you, Jake.

01:45:23.948 --> 01:45:25.438
I did warn you.

01:45:26.951 --> 01:45:28.782
I lied to you, Winnie.

01:45:34.692 --> 01:45:38.253
I've been in contact with your father
behind your back.

01:45:42.633 --> 01:45:44.897
After we saw him at the dinner,

01:45:45.803 --> 01:45:47.964
before you gave me the money.

01:45:59.683 --> 01:46:01.048
Why?

01:46:03.787 --> 01:46:07.883
Because I thought it was the best thing
for you, you know. For us.

01:46:17.835 --> 01:46:19.063
I just wanted to...

01:46:26.577 --> 01:46:28.135
You're like him.

01:46:30.314 --> 01:46:32.349
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Winnie.

01:46:35.386 --> 01:46:38.378
I'll make it up to you.
I promise I'll get the money back.

01:46:38.622 --> 01:46:42.683
I don't care about the money, Jake!
This is not about the money.

01:46:42.793 --> 01:46:45.523
This is about you and me,
and we are not good anymore.

01:46:48.432 --> 01:46:50.866
Winn, we are good.
Come on.

01:46:52.269 --> 01:46:53.258
We are good.

01:46:54.138 --> 01:46:56.368
- Come on, Winn. We're good.
- No.

01:46:59.209 --> 01:47:02.076
We're supposed to make
each other feel safe.

01:47:04.081 --> 01:47:06.174
Otherwise, what's the point?

01:47:12.356 --> 01:47:13.914
It's gone, Jake.

01:47:15.125 --> 01:47:17.093
It's not. Please don't.

01:47:17.194 --> 01:47:18.627
Take it.

01:47:25.069 --> 01:47:26.536
Come on, Winn.

01:47:27.805 --> 01:47:29.102
Please go.

01:47:30.441 --> 01:47:31.601
Please.

01:47:32.810 --> 01:47:33.799
Go.

01:47:40.818 --> 01:47:42.115
I'm sorry.

01:48:15.219 --> 01:48:20.282
China, India, Brazil.
Silver, oil, copper, I want to own it all.

01:48:20.524 --> 01:48:23.015
Buy me Churchill Schwartz,

01:48:23.127 --> 01:48:25.618
and get me updates
on the other financials.

01:48:25.729 --> 01:48:28.493
I'm looking for deals.
Only good deals.

01:48:28.599 --> 01:48:32.000
Just ride the trends.
Just don't try too hard for the turns.

01:48:32.102 --> 01:48:34.195
It's just like the old days, Bobby.

01:48:34.304 --> 01:48:36.329
<i>What do you feel
about California municipals, Gordon?</i>

01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:39.034
No way.
California has made more mistakes

01:48:39.143 --> 01:48:41.771
than Yogi Berra reciting Shakespeare.

01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:46.208
Right now, it is ugly times ugly.

01:48:47.117 --> 01:48:49.585
And that's when the ugly get going.

01:48:50.687 --> 01:48:54.088
You tell them for me, babe,
Gordon Gekko is back.

01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:00.259
I'm looking for distressed securities.
I'm trying to get a hold of them

01:49:00.364 --> 01:49:03.060
before the government does.
You got that?

01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:04.926
Okay.

01:49:05.636 --> 01:49:08.230
- Here you are, Mr. Gekko.
- Nice, Harry.

01:49:08.705 --> 01:49:11.674
Well, then, Alex,
you tell the Treasury Department for me

01:49:11.775 --> 01:49:15.006
that I'm willing to stand
on the other side of their auction.

01:49:15.112 --> 01:49:17.603
Not too tight under the arms, Mr. Gekko?

01:49:17.714 --> 01:49:20.774
Jesus Christ. I tell you,
the government's worse than a wife.

01:49:20.884 --> 01:49:23.910
They got all the power,
they got half the money.

01:49:24.021 --> 01:49:26.455
Now they're working
on getting the other half.

01:49:26.823 --> 01:49:28.552
Hey, hey, stay positive, pal.

01:49:28.659 --> 01:49:31.423
Most people, they lose,
they whine and quit.

01:49:31.528 --> 01:49:32.927
But you got to be there for the turns.

01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:35.464
Everybody's got good luck,
everybody's got bad luck.

01:49:35.566 --> 01:49:39.127
Don't run when you lose.
Don't whine when it hurts.

01:49:39.236 --> 01:49:41.204
It's like the first grade, Jerry.

01:49:41.305 --> 01:49:43.000
Nobody likes a crybaby.

01:49:43.106 --> 01:49:45.904
- Whooshing sound.
- I'll take four of these.

01:49:59.590 --> 01:50:01.751
Feels good to be back on top, huh?

01:50:05.862 --> 01:50:08.592
Hey, champ.
What brings you to London?

01:50:08.799 --> 01:50:10.790
You, Gordo.

01:50:12.936 --> 01:50:15.234
You want to make one last trade?

01:50:15.339 --> 01:50:17.330
Well, that depends.

01:50:18.909 --> 01:50:21.241
Did you ever really want
to reconcile with her?

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:24.645
I'm human.

01:50:24.748 --> 01:50:26.113
Then why did you do it?

01:50:26.216 --> 01:50:28.047
Well, it's the same answer.

01:50:28.151 --> 01:50:31.143
Look, I told you before,
Winnie was gonna stake me when I got out.

01:50:31.722 --> 01:50:34.054
- You remember, she reneged.
- Sure, she did.

01:50:34.691 --> 01:50:37.057
It makes you feel better
about stealing from your own blood,

01:50:37.294 --> 01:50:38.591
doesn't it?

01:50:38.695 --> 01:50:40.686
Every thief has some excuse.

01:50:41.064 --> 01:50:43.555
Hey, don't you act so superior, kid.

01:50:44.701 --> 01:50:49.661
They took 122 thousand hours of my life
for a victimless crime.

01:50:49.873 --> 01:50:52.569
I ate my bitterness every goddamn day.

01:50:52.676 --> 01:50:54.337
And when I got out,
who was waiting for me?

01:50:54.444 --> 01:50:55.604
Nobody!

01:50:56.580 --> 01:50:58.548
Not even my own daughter.

01:50:59.383 --> 01:51:02.284
I thought Bretton was slime
until I met you.

01:51:03.153 --> 01:51:05.678
I just never believed that a man
would sell out his own daughter.

01:51:05.789 --> 01:51:09.020
You die your way, I'll die mine.
Get the hell out of here.

01:51:09.126 --> 01:51:10.252
You know, she left me, Gordon.

01:51:10.527 --> 01:51:11.585
Yeah?

01:51:13.063 --> 01:51:15.156
I'm sorry about that.

01:51:15.265 --> 01:51:17.324
Yeah? I bet you are.

01:51:18.068 --> 01:51:20.036
You left it all in ruins.

01:51:21.505 --> 01:51:25.305
But no matter how much money you make,
you'll never be rich.

01:51:25.409 --> 01:51:29.209
See, that's what you never got, kid.
It's not about the money.

01:51:30.314 --> 01:51:33.715
It's about the game.
The game between people.

01:51:34.751 --> 01:51:36.514
And that's all it is.

01:51:39.089 --> 01:51:40.420
Speaking of,

01:51:42.125 --> 01:51:43.888
what's the trade?

01:51:44.094 --> 01:51:48.326
You give back the principal to Winnie.
The $100 million.

01:51:50.567 --> 01:51:52.660
And what do I get in return?

01:51:55.739 --> 01:51:57.104
Put this in.

01:52:14.725 --> 01:52:16.488
That's your grandson.

01:52:34.077 --> 01:52:37.569
You said, "The most valuable commodity
I know is time."

01:52:38.749 --> 01:52:40.614
You're looking at time.

01:52:41.351 --> 01:52:42.613
Not money.

01:52:45.622 --> 01:52:47.385
This is time, Gordon.

01:53:00.337 --> 01:53:04.569
I'm sorry, Jake, but this is simply
a trade I cannot make.

01:53:17.687 --> 01:53:19.814
You're a sad man, Gordon.

01:54:34.197 --> 01:54:35.687
You really want to get
this site on the map?

01:54:35.799 --> 01:54:39.462
You break this story.
It'll take some time, but it'll spread.

01:54:39.569 --> 01:54:42.163
It's the single greatest transfer of wealth
in American history

01:54:42.272 --> 01:54:44.604
from Main Street to Wall Street,
and it's all true.

01:54:44.708 --> 01:54:47.677
And it will happen again because
people like you and me want to be lied to.

01:54:48.378 --> 01:54:50.312
We like bedtime stories.

01:54:53.450 --> 01:54:57.045
I miss you like crazy,
and I love you, baby, and I'm sorry.

01:55:41.464 --> 01:55:46.458
Bretton James, the rumor is that
he was shorting Keller Zabel stock

01:55:46.570 --> 01:55:48.060
before he ended up acquiring it.

01:55:48.371 --> 01:55:50.839
Why would he do that?
This is the rock star of Wall Street.

01:55:50.941 --> 01:55:51.965
Did you hear about Bretton James?

01:55:52.142 --> 01:55:55.168
CNBC will say he's hedging,
but if you ask me it's a fraud.

01:55:55.378 --> 01:55:58.779
It's a tiny website. Who cares?

01:55:59.215 --> 01:56:02.207
Gekko's daughter
and that smartass kid I fired, Moore.

01:56:02.319 --> 01:56:05.618
What is this about the rumor that led
to Louis Zabel committing suicide?

01:56:05.722 --> 01:56:08.748
Well, shorting his own company,
you can't bust him for that.

01:56:08.858 --> 01:56:12.316
But they can get him for running
false rumors on Zabel, that's serious.

01:56:12.429 --> 01:56:14.192
It's gone viral, Bretton.

01:56:14.297 --> 01:56:17.061
Bloomberg has a summary out on it.
Reuters is playing the story big.

01:56:17.167 --> 01:56:20.261
It's become legitimate.
Congress is next.

01:56:21.571 --> 01:56:23.664
This bank is bigger than you, Bretton.

01:56:24.541 --> 01:56:27.305
We know there's nothing illegal here, Jimmy.

01:56:28.278 --> 01:56:29.336
Jack?

01:56:32.882 --> 01:56:33.974
Julie...

01:56:35.251 --> 01:56:37.048
Are you stupid or what?

01:56:37.387 --> 01:56:39.981
Trading for your account in your position?

01:56:40.624 --> 01:56:44.060
You pigged out, kid.
You were making a fortune here.

01:56:44.327 --> 01:56:46.625
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:56:47.597 --> 01:56:48.791
Come on.

01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:52.395
So I double-dipped.

01:56:52.769 --> 01:56:53.997
Who hasn't?

01:56:54.104 --> 01:56:57.267
Now, in your time,
you must have done some things.

01:56:58.074 --> 01:56:59.939
You're retiring, Julie.

01:57:00.910 --> 01:57:03.003
Why don't you step up in front of this?

01:57:03.346 --> 01:57:04.938
You can afford it.

01:57:05.048 --> 01:57:06.811
I can still run this place

01:57:06.916 --> 01:57:10.909
and make you more money
than you ever dreamed.

01:57:13.690 --> 01:57:17.626
We both know that's not
going to happen, kid.

01:57:26.636 --> 01:57:27.762
Julie.

01:57:28.505 --> 01:57:30.564
Think about this, please.

01:57:30.674 --> 01:57:32.198
You look for the birds.

01:57:33.710 --> 01:57:36.270
They're going to help you, those birds.
You'll see. Good luck.

01:57:41.351 --> 01:57:45.947
<i>I think I waited too long</i>

01:57:47.323 --> 01:57:52.158
<i>I'm moving into the dollhouse</i>

01:57:52.796 --> 01:57:55.458
<i>Some days we exercise</i>

01:57:55.565 --> 01:57:58.295
<i>Some days we harmonize</i>

01:57:58.401 --> 01:58:03.464
<i>Look away, look away
Look away, oh, yeah</i>

01:58:06.342 --> 01:58:09.277
I don't wanna sound like a rooster
taking credit for the dawn,

01:58:09.379 --> 01:58:13.475
but turning $100 million into $1.1 billion

01:58:13.583 --> 01:58:16.347
in this market,
takes some brains, right?

01:58:17.287 --> 01:58:19.346
My guys are good.

01:58:20.490 --> 01:58:23.721
And it's no wonder our new fund
is over-subscribed.

01:58:24.661 --> 01:58:28.290
But for you,
I'm gonna initiate a third fund.

01:58:29.599 --> 01:58:33.467
Because, frankly, Julie,
I couldn't be more excited about this.

01:58:33.570 --> 01:58:36.698
To finally be in business
with you and your firm.

01:58:39.442 --> 01:58:41.933
And us with you, Gekko.

01:58:48.051 --> 01:58:49.018
Yeah.

01:58:51.321 --> 01:58:53.755
<i>What is the definition of insanity?</i>

01:58:55.191 --> 01:58:59.594
<i>It's doing the same thing over and over
and expecting a different result.</i>

01:59:01.965 --> 01:59:04.991
<i>By that standard,
most of us are insane.</i>

01:59:05.101 --> 01:59:07.069
<i>But not at the same time.</i>

01:59:08.371 --> 01:59:10.430
<i>And on that basis we trust.</i>

01:59:12.242 --> 01:59:13.937
<i>But can this way of life endure</i>

01:59:14.043 --> 01:59:17.308
<i>if more and more people are insane
at the same time?</i>

01:59:19.015 --> 01:59:22.712
<i>It becomes, as Gordon said,
"Systemic."</i>

01:59:23.386 --> 01:59:24.478
<i>Like cancer.</i>

01:59:27.123 --> 01:59:28.750
<i>What happens then?</i>

01:59:31.127 --> 01:59:32.992
<i>Like I said,</i>

01:59:33.096 --> 01:59:36.429
<i>the mother of all bubbles
was the Cambrian Explosion.</i>

01:59:37.834 --> 01:59:40.735
<i>And it happened by chance
over 500 million years ago.</i>

01:59:40.837 --> 01:59:42.065
Louis Zabel, Bretton?

01:59:42.172 --> 01:59:43.332
Tell us about Louis Zabel.

01:59:44.174 --> 01:59:46.836
- Come on. Come on.
- No!

01:59:48.645 --> 01:59:51.773
<i>Scientists will tell you
it was unprecedented,</i>

01:59:51.881 --> 01:59:53.178
<i>it happened in a flash.</i>

01:59:56.186 --> 01:59:57.847
<i>And from it,</i>

01:59:57.954 --> 02:00:01.515
<i>suddenly the world
had millions of new species.</i>

02:00:01.624 --> 02:00:03.819
I'd love a coffee.
So be in, like, 10.

02:00:03.927 --> 02:00:05.622
- <i>And from that...</i>
- Where are you going?

02:00:05.728 --> 02:00:06.956
<i>was born us.</i>

02:00:07.063 --> 02:00:08.052
Look at you!

02:00:08.164 --> 02:00:09.153
<i>The human race.</i>

02:00:09.265 --> 02:00:11.995
Mr. Schwartz, I hear you are leaving us.

02:00:12.202 --> 02:00:14.397
No, that won't be soon enough.

02:00:14.504 --> 02:00:16.369
Oh. Have you thought
about a timeshare in Florida?

02:00:16.472 --> 02:00:17.962
I could hook you up in Boca.

02:00:19.108 --> 02:00:20.837
Sit down, Mr. James.

02:00:21.644 --> 02:00:25.774
<i>Now, in that sense,
bubbles are evolutionary.</i>

02:00:25.982 --> 02:00:28.041
This is only a preliminary proceeding.

02:00:28.151 --> 02:00:29.982
But I want you to know
you're under investigation

02:00:30.086 --> 02:00:33.681
on accusations of tax evasion
and stock manipulation

02:00:33.790 --> 02:00:37.658
through, among others,
an entity called Locust Fund.

02:00:37.760 --> 02:00:40.923
Although, I want to first get
to the matter of Louis Zabel.

02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:43.260
I see here that you cooperated
with this office

02:00:43.366 --> 02:00:46.358
and with the federal authorities in 1988

02:00:46.469 --> 02:00:49.927
when the investigations
of one Gordon Gekko began.

02:00:50.039 --> 02:00:51.631
<i>They kill excess.</i>

02:00:52.709 --> 02:00:54.574
<i>They lean out the herd.</i>

02:00:55.311 --> 02:00:57.006
<i>But they never die.</i>

02:00:58.147 --> 02:01:00.513
<i>They just come back
in different forms.</i>

02:01:10.226 --> 02:01:12.126
<i>When they burst,</i>

02:01:12.228 --> 02:01:14.389
<i>they give birth to a new day.</i>

02:01:29.112 --> 02:01:30.977
<i>Always creating change.</i>

02:01:51.701 --> 02:01:53.293
Can I carry that?

02:01:58.408 --> 02:02:00.467
You're not sleeping either?

02:02:00.910 --> 02:02:02.878
He woke me up last night.

02:02:06.683 --> 02:02:07.741
Yeah.

02:02:08.518 --> 02:02:09.644
Can I?

02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:11.980
Yeah.

02:02:23.232 --> 02:02:24.358
There?

02:02:25.034 --> 02:02:26.092
Yeah.

02:02:33.676 --> 02:02:36.042
I just got off the phone with Dr. Masters.

02:02:36.145 --> 02:02:37.510
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

02:02:38.481 --> 02:02:39.971
Very happy man.

02:02:40.683 --> 02:02:42.878
Renewed interests from investors.

02:02:43.019 --> 02:02:44.850
Because of your story.

02:02:45.455 --> 02:02:46.922
So, thank you.

02:02:51.294 --> 02:02:52.989
I miss you, Winnie.

02:02:54.497 --> 02:02:55.828
I miss you.

02:02:58.835 --> 02:03:00.996
I don't know how to fix this.

02:03:02.805 --> 02:03:04.238
Neither do I.

02:03:06.743 --> 02:03:08.370
It's different now.

02:03:08.478 --> 02:03:11.072
- What can I do? I mean, I...
- Nothing.

02:03:13.049 --> 02:03:14.243
Nothing.

02:03:24.260 --> 02:03:25.318
Thank you.

02:03:26.162 --> 02:03:28.096
- Good night.
- Good night.

02:03:33.369 --> 02:03:35.303
Where are you two going?

02:03:47.550 --> 02:03:50.576
What, nobody around here
believes in comebacks?

02:03:56.426 --> 02:03:58.417
Winn, I owe you something.

02:03:59.929 --> 02:04:02.591
I don't want it.
I never did.

02:04:03.966 --> 02:04:05.524
No, I figured that.

02:04:05.635 --> 02:04:09.537
But, you know,
when choosing between two evils,

02:04:09.639 --> 02:04:14.440
I like to try the one
that I haven't tried before.

02:04:16.279 --> 02:04:20.079
So I deposited a check of $100 million

02:04:21.417 --> 02:04:23.977
made out to United Fusion.

02:04:27.356 --> 02:04:30.587
From some offshore fund
no one needs to know about.

02:04:32.161 --> 02:04:35.187
Wouldn't you say green
is the new bubble, Jake?

02:04:44.774 --> 02:04:46.833
You two make a nice couple.

02:04:54.650 --> 02:04:58.177
You know, Winn, human beings,

02:05:00.690 --> 02:05:02.783
we got to give them a break.

02:05:04.927 --> 02:05:06.656
We're all mixed bags.

02:05:13.803 --> 02:05:14.792
But

02:05:16.706 --> 02:05:18.264
my grandson,

02:05:20.009 --> 02:05:21.306
and you...

02:05:23.613 --> 02:05:26.912
And maybe, you know,
you'll let me be a father again.

02:05:43.032 --> 02:05:48.868
<i>The dimming of the light
makes the picture clearer</i>

02:05:49.338 --> 02:05:52.739
<i>It's just an old photograph</i>

02:05:52.842 --> 02:05:56.801
<i>There's nothing to hide</i>

02:05:56.913 --> 02:06:02.510
<i>And we'll mix our lives together</i>

02:06:04.787 --> 02:06:07.585
<i>Every hand</i>

02:06:07.857 --> 02:06:14.592
<i>Goes searching for its partner</i>

02:06:16.465 --> 02:06:19.093
<i>In crime</i>

02:06:19.202 --> 02:06:21.670
<i>Connecting</i>

02:06:22.471 --> 02:06:26.430
<i>To every living soul</i>

02:06:29.312 --> 02:06:31.075
<i>I'm looking for a home</i>

02:06:32.715 --> 02:06:36.583
<i>Where the wheels are turning</i>

02:06:36.686 --> 02:06:41.885
<i>Home
Why I keep returning</i>

02:06:42.191 --> 02:06:48.562
<i>Home
Will infect what ever you do</i>

02:06:53.502 --> 02:06:58.872
<i>Home
With the neighbors fighting</i>

02:06:59.108 --> 02:07:04.512
<i>Home
Always so exciting</i>

02:07:04.714 --> 02:07:10.744
<i>Home
Were my parents telling the truth?</i>

02:07:12.054 --> 02:07:14.284
What's the matter with you guys?
Come on, what's the matter?

02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:16.153
You guys are like the last two
on a ship that is sinking.

02:07:22.531 --> 02:07:23.657
That's pretty.

02:07:23.899 --> 02:07:26.060
Isn't that a Cracker Jack box ring?

02:07:27.203 --> 02:07:32.607
<i>Home
With our bodies touching</i>

02:07:32.808 --> 02:07:38.405
<i>Home
And the cameras watching</i>

02:07:38.514 --> 02:07:44.578
<i>Home
Comes to life from out of the blue</i>

02:08:23.626 --> 02:08:27.357
<i>Home is where I want to be</i>

02:08:27.463 --> 02:08:30.864
<i>Pick me up and turn me round</i>

02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:35.696
<i>I feel numb
Born with a weak heart</i>

02:08:36.339 --> 02:08:39.672
<i>I guess I must be having fun</i>

02:08:40.443 --> 02:08:43.378
<i>The less we say about it the better</i>

02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:47.171
<i>Make it up as we go along</i>

02:08:48.818 --> 02:08:52.754
<i>Feet on the ground
Head in the sky</i>

02:08:52.855 --> 02:08:56.154
<i>It's okay
I know nothing's wrong</i>

02:08:56.258 --> 02:08:57.725
<i>Nothing</i>

02:08:57.827 --> 02:09:02.264
<i>Hi, yo
I got plenty of time</i>

02:09:06.135 --> 02:09:11.038
<i>Hi, yo
You got light in your eyes</i>

02:09:13.242 --> 02:09:16.905
<i>And you're standing here beside me</i>

02:09:18.547 --> 02:09:21.573
<i>I love the passing of time</i>

02:09:22.385 --> 02:09:26.412
<i>Never for money
Always for love</i>

02:09:26.522 --> 02:09:29.616
<i>Cover up and say good night</i>

02:09:29.725 --> 02:09:31.886
<i>Say good night</i>

02:10:00.089 --> 02:10:03.684
<i>Home is where I want to be</i>

02:10:03.793 --> 02:10:06.887
<i>But I guess
I'm already there</i>

02:10:07.730 --> 02:10:11.894
<i>I come home
She lifted up her wings</i>

02:10:12.501 --> 02:10:15.766
<i>Guess that this must be the place</i>

02:10:16.772 --> 02:10:19.707
<i>I can't tell one from another</i>

02:10:21.110 --> 02:10:23.601
<i>Did I find you or you find me?</i>

02:10:25.281 --> 02:10:28.614
<i>There was a time before we were born</i>

02:10:29.385 --> 02:10:32.513
<i>If someone asks
This is where I'll be</i>

02:10:32.621 --> 02:10:34.054
<i>Where I'll be</i>

02:10:34.156 --> 02:10:39.059
<i>Hi, yo
We drift in and out</i>

02:10:42.531 --> 02:10:47.230
<i>Hi, yo
Sing into my mouth</i>

02:10:49.638 --> 02:10:53.699
<i>Out of all those kinds of people</i>

02:10:54.810 --> 02:10:57.404
<i>You got a face with a view</i>

02:10:59.081 --> 02:11:02.881
<i>I'm just an animal looking for a home</i>

02:11:02.985 --> 02:11:06.216
<i>Share the same space
for a minute or two</i>

02:11:06.388 --> 02:11:10.449
<i>And you love me till my heart stops</i>

02:11:11.794 --> 02:11:14.228
<i>Love me till I'm dead</i>

02:11:15.764 --> 02:11:19.291
<i>Eyes that light up
Eyes look through you</i>

02:11:19.602 --> 02:11:21.695
<i>Cover up the blank spots</i>

02:11:21.804 --> 02:11:23.795
<i>Hit me on the head</i>

02:11:23.939 --> 02:11:25.236
<i>Ooh</i>

02:11:36.418 --> 02:11:40.013
<i>Home is where I want to be</i>

02:11:40.122 --> 02:11:43.182
<i>Pick me up and turn me round</i>

02:11:44.226 --> 02:11:48.322
<i>I feel numb
Born with a weak heart</i>

02:11:48.430 --> 02:11:51.456
<i>I guess I must be having fun</i>

02:11:53.168 --> 02:11:57.229
<i>The less we say about it the better</i>

02:11:57.339 --> 02:11:59.637
<i>Make it up as we go along</i>

02:12:01.577 --> 02:12:05.570
<i>Feet on the ground
Head in the sky</i>

02:12:05.714 --> 02:12:08.740
<i>It's okay
I know nothing's wrong</i>

02:12:08.851 --> 02:12:10.375
<i>Nothing</i>

02:12:10.486 --> 02:12:15.355
<i>Hi, yo
I got plenty of time</i>

02:12:18.861 --> 02:12:23.821
<i>Hi, yo
You got light in your eyes</i>

02:12:25.901 --> 02:12:30.804
