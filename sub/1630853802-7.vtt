00:08.675 --> 00:10.176
- Don't you miss it?

00:10.218 --> 00:11.886
I'm starting to forget things.

00:11.928 --> 00:15.015
Who I am. Who we are.

00:15.056 --> 00:17.851
[tense music]

00:17.892 --> 00:18.852
- [sighs]

00:18.893 --> 00:20.353
What's this?

00:20.395 --> 00:21.730
- It's my tooth. It broke.

00:21.771 --> 00:23.690
[gasps]

00:23.732 --> 00:25.567
- I am worried about you.

00:25.608 --> 00:28.319
- Okay, well, great.
I feel very cared for.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.196
- Two kids are missing.

00:30.238 --> 00:32.198
- Hey, Vi?

00:32.240 --> 00:33.575
Where is she?

00:33.616 --> 00:35.410
- All of these places
in your book

00:35.452 --> 00:37.162
are real places
in the Peninsula,

00:37.203 --> 00:38.747
all leading to Pasaje.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.206
- This is all my fault.

00:40.248 --> 00:43.209
I started a series of events
that ended up in death.

00:43.251 --> 00:45.045
- We have to go find Pasaje.

00:45.086 --> 00:47.172
That's where they were going,
so we gotta go there too.

00:47.213 --> 00:50.216
- Emma, you gotta move on.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.718
- Don't follow me.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.262

* *

01:22.916 --> 01:25.085
[touch-tones beeping]

01:25.126 --> 01:28.171
- You have six new messages.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.714
First message.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.758
[phone beeps]

01:31.800 --> 01:32.884
- Hi, Mr. Thompson.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.844
I don't know
if this hotline is real,

01:34.886 --> 01:36.888
but my name is Emma Reed,

01:36.930 --> 01:38.598
and you don't--
you don't know me.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.101
But I'm here in Akumal
at the Bahía del Paraíso,

01:41.142 --> 01:42.435
and a few days ago...

01:42.477 --> 01:46.231
- * Along the sea *

01:46.272 --> 01:48.191
* He drew circles
in the sand *

01:48.233 --> 01:51.319
- [snoring]

01:51.361 --> 01:54.030
- * Thinking they could
shut us out *

01:54.072 --> 01:56.157
- [blowing]

01:56.199 --> 02:00.161
- * He drew circles
and closed himself inside *

02:00.203 --> 02:01.287
- Emma?

02:01.329 --> 02:03.498
- * The lines round about *

02:03.540 --> 02:05.542
- Emma.

02:05.583 --> 02:08.044
- * He doesn't believe it's *

02:08.086 --> 02:11.256
- And another smile.

02:11.297 --> 02:12.882
[camera shutter clicking]
- Oh--Luna! Hey!

02:12.924 --> 02:14.467
- Okay. Keep the smiles.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.803
- Hey, Luna, you haven't seen
Emma anywhere, have you?

02:16.845 --> 02:18.179
- No, Mr. Reed.
Is everything okay?

02:18.221 --> 02:19.222
- Oh, yeah, it's fine.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.640
She's probably
just at the pool.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.143
- * Lose his life
and will not know why *

02:23.184 --> 02:24.561
- Okay, smile.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.813
- [groans]

02:26.855 --> 02:27.981
For real? For real.

02:28.023 --> 02:30.567
[line trilling]

02:30.608 --> 02:32.819
- Hey, it's Emma.
Uh, I'll call you back.

02:32.861 --> 02:36.072
Thanks. Bye.

02:36.114 --> 02:40.827
- * For we *

02:40.869 --> 02:46.291
* Love you *

02:46.332 --> 02:53.340
* *

02:53.381 --> 02:57.761
* People love each other *

02:57.802 --> 02:59.596
* I'm sure it's the only *

02:59.637 --> 03:01.890
- * I'm sure
it's the only way *

03:01.931 --> 03:03.350
- * Only way *

03:03.391 --> 03:06.394
* I know you will discover *

03:06.436 --> 03:12.025
* Some striking similarities *

03:12.067 --> 03:18.823
* Open up your eyes
and you can see *

03:18.865 --> 03:20.158
- [groans]

03:20.200 --> 03:23.370
* *

03:23.411 --> 03:27.999
* And we *

03:28.041 --> 03:31.878
* Love you *

03:31.920 --> 03:34.297
* *

03:34.339 --> 03:37.842
* La-la-la-la-la-la-la *

03:37.884 --> 03:42.806
* *

03:42.847 --> 03:45.100
* And we *

03:45.141 --> 03:46.267
- What in tarnation?

03:46.309 --> 03:48.144
- There's a guy down there!

03:48.186 --> 03:50.397
Oh, shoot.
Did my ball hit you?

03:50.438 --> 03:52.273
- What the hell?
- Are you all right?

03:53.900 --> 03:56.444
Don't touch it.
You just let it lie.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.073
Huh? What?

04:00.115 --> 04:01.241
Hey!

04:01.282 --> 04:03.118
Hey, you!
- [hisses]

04:03.159 --> 04:04.536
- Don't you hiss at me.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.037
Come back here, you.
- Hey.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.872
- Wait!

04:07.914 --> 04:09.582
- How about snorkeling?
- Not so much.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.334
I have trouble breathing
out of my mouth.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.752
I have a trachea
that kind of just

04:12.794 --> 04:14.629
shuts down sometimes
with allergens.

04:14.671 --> 04:15.672
- Oh, okay.
- Stop, stop, stop.

04:15.714 --> 04:17.465
I have never been
snorkeling, so--

04:17.507 --> 04:19.259
- What?
You have never been snorkeling?

04:19.300 --> 04:21.302
A grown man has never
been snorkeling.

04:21.344 --> 04:22.595
- [chuckling] I've told you.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.305
Ted, please don't shame me
in front of people.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.598
- I'm not shaming you.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.766
- You know, I grew up
lower middle-class.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.643
My family never did
these things.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.395
- Snorkeling is not
an expensive activity, Ted.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.646
It's just that I have
trouble with it.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.690
- It's fine.
Maybe we can do something else.

04:33.732 --> 04:36.151
- I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

04:36.192 --> 04:38.319
I think you're missing the
point about being surprised.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.487
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

04:39.529 --> 04:40.488
Are you still worked up
about this?

04:40.530 --> 04:41.948
- Yes.
I want you to pick

04:41.990 --> 04:43.366
something new and different
for us to do,

04:43.408 --> 04:44.743
something that I've never done.

04:44.784 --> 04:45.827
Is it so hard?
- Yes, it's hard.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.078
I don't know
what you haven't done.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.121
- Sorry. You know what?

04:48.163 --> 04:49.247
I'm just gonna get
a drink by myself

04:49.289 --> 04:50.582
while I wait to be surprised.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.876
- [sighs]
I'm gonna be surprised

04:52.917 --> 04:54.127
if I don't throw him
in the pool.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.337
- [laughs]

04:55.378 --> 04:56.504
- Okay, let's see
what we have here.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.048
- Yes.
Um, how about the birds?

04:58.089 --> 04:59.466
- Well, here's something
we haven't done, I don't think.

04:59.507 --> 05:00.800
[tires screeching]
Ahh!

05:00.842 --> 05:03.136
- Oh, my God!
- Holy shit.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.429
This is why I don't golf.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.098
Everybody's a fuckin' lunatic.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.018
- Emma?

05:10.060 --> 05:11.353
I need to see the book!

05:11.394 --> 05:12.729
[upbeat quirky music]

05:12.771 --> 05:15.690
[groaning]

05:18.777 --> 05:19.944
Oh!

05:19.986 --> 05:21.154
[breathing heavily]

05:21.196 --> 05:24.366
* *

05:24.407 --> 05:25.825
Emma?

05:29.746 --> 05:30.955
Noah!

05:30.997 --> 05:34.709
* *

05:34.751 --> 05:36.044
Ahh!

05:36.086 --> 05:38.004
Puta madre.
[groans]

05:38.046 --> 05:40.215
* *

05:40.256 --> 05:42.592
[knock at door]

05:46.137 --> 05:49.474
[both speaking Spanish]

06:09.285 --> 06:10.870
- No, no, no, no!
Qué haces? Qué haces?

06:39.983 --> 06:41.985
[knock at door]
- Shh, shh!

06:42.027 --> 06:43.194
[door clicks]

06:53.538 --> 06:57.042
- Emma?

06:57.083 --> 06:59.586
Baltasar Frías.

06:59.627 --> 07:03.465
- Murray Thompson.

07:03.506 --> 07:07.093
Time hasn't been
too kind to us.

07:07.135 --> 07:09.471
- No, it has not.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.056
both: What are you doing here?

07:11.097 --> 07:12.265
I'm looking for Emma.

07:12.307 --> 07:13.892
How do you know Emma?

07:13.933 --> 07:15.685
- You go first.
- No, you go first.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.645
You came in last.
- Somebody just speak.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.272
- I got a long,
disturbing message

07:19.314 --> 07:21.775
from some woman named Emma.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.610
She believes
that Violet was searching

07:23.651 --> 07:25.195
for something called Pasaje.

07:25.236 --> 07:28.239
And now I guess
she's gone to look for it too.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.657
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.784
- She found it?

07:30.825 --> 07:32.410
- This woman
doesn't sound well.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.870
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I was hoping to arrive here

07:33.912 --> 07:35.330
before she left, but I'm...
- She's gone.

07:35.372 --> 07:36.623
- No.
- Guessing I missed her.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.583
- It's all happening again.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.918
Noah asked me for her
this morning,

07:39.959 --> 07:42.379
and now they're both gone.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.463
- Then I'll go find them.

07:43.505 --> 07:44.714
- No, you can't.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.633
The only man
who knows how to get there

07:46.675 --> 07:48.551
is dead because of me.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.136
- I'm sorry?
- Yeah, that's a long story

07:50.178 --> 07:51.805
filled with shame and regret
and pain,

07:51.846 --> 07:54.015
and we don't have time
for that.

07:54.057 --> 07:58.103
- Well, then it's a good thing
she told me how to get there.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.564
All we need is a ride.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.069
[phone beeps]
- Hi, Mr. Thompson.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.071
Uh, I don't know
if this hotline is real,

08:08.113 --> 08:10.532
but, um, my name is Emma Reed,

08:10.573 --> 08:12.033
and you don't--
you don't know me.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.744
But I'm here in Akumal
at the Bahía del Paraíso,

08:14.786 --> 08:16.788
and a few days ago,
I found a cell phone

08:16.830 --> 08:20.083
that belonged to Sam Lawford.

08:20.125 --> 08:25.046
And, uh, yesterday, my husband
found Violet's phone.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.632
Uh, it's wild.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.050
It's been
a really strange week

08:29.092 --> 08:31.136
and a long night,
and I haven't slept much,

08:31.177 --> 08:32.679
and honestly,
I'm--I'm a little bit

08:32.721 --> 08:34.139
losing my grip on reality,

08:34.180 --> 08:36.016
but I have some good news,
which is that I know

08:36.057 --> 08:37.851
where Sam and Violet
were going.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.854
They were searching
for something called Pasaje.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.772
And it's this
kind of underground room

08:42.814 --> 08:44.274
that exists outside of time,

08:44.315 --> 08:46.192
and Violet thought
that she could see

08:46.234 --> 08:49.279
her mom again there.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.282
And now, uh, I'm about
to look for it myself.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.533
So I--I wanted to j--

08:53.575 --> 08:55.368
[phone beeps]

08:55.410 --> 08:56.786
Sorry about that.
Your phone cut me off.

08:56.828 --> 08:59.330
Sorry. Uh, sorry.
Uh, moving on.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.916
Um, and you might want
to take notes here, I think.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.252
Okay, so to find
this Pasaje thing,

09:04.294 --> 09:07.714
you enter the jungle at Parque
de Corazones Degollado,

09:07.756 --> 09:10.508
and then you hike straight in
for exactly 13.5 kilometers

09:10.550 --> 09:13.303
until you find a very large
clearing of tall grass.

09:13.345 --> 09:14.846
Now, this is where
it gets very tricky,

09:14.888 --> 09:16.056
because somewhere
near the clearing

09:16.097 --> 09:18.850
is this cluster
of rare pink fungi,

09:18.892 --> 09:21.019
but the fungi doesn't
grow year round.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.645
But when it does grow, though,

09:22.687 --> 09:25.523
it's always within 30 meters
of the underground entrance

09:25.565 --> 09:26.775
to Pasaje.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.110
And, um,
I know that this sounds

09:29.152 --> 09:31.237
like I'm totally full of shit.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.239
But, uh, all the details
are in the last chapter

09:33.281 --> 09:35.825
of this book called
"La Desilusión del Tiempo."

09:35.867 --> 09:38.078
And now--so the writer
of this book,

09:38.119 --> 09:40.580
he took Violet and Sam there
15 years ago,

09:40.622 --> 09:41.831
and he's dead now.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.249
The writer is--
the writer's dead.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.335
And anyway, I--
[phone beeps]

09:45.377 --> 09:49.214
[gasping, coughing]

09:49.255 --> 09:50.423
Sorry, again.

09:50.465 --> 09:51.591
Anyway, yes.

09:51.633 --> 09:52.801
So the--yeah, the author died,

09:52.842 --> 09:54.386
and that was
fucking horrific...

09:54.427 --> 09:55.929
[screaming]
To see.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.931
It really puts shit
into perspective, you know?

09:57.972 --> 10:01.434
My own life. My own mortality.

10:01.476 --> 10:02.727
Um, sorry.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.688
Sorry, I'm--

10:04.729 --> 10:06.314
I'm turning this
into a therapy session.

10:06.356 --> 10:10.443
This isn't about me.
This is about Violet and Sam.

10:10.485 --> 10:13.363
[gentle music]

10:13.405 --> 10:18.118
I just--I think I was
falling in love

10:18.159 --> 10:21.871
with the idea
of Violet and Sam

10:21.913 --> 10:23.873
because they were
at that time in their life

10:23.915 --> 10:26.167
when everything is
so meaningful,

10:26.209 --> 10:29.963
and the highs are, like,
so fucking high, you know?

10:30.005 --> 10:31.423
And who doesn't want to go
back in time

10:31.464 --> 10:34.134
to that first love,
to be young and dumb and--

10:34.175 --> 10:35.427
you know, I'm not saying
that your daughter

10:35.468 --> 10:36.970
is dumb, of course.

10:37.012 --> 10:42.142
I just--I just think
that's why we love "Titanic"

10:42.183 --> 10:46.062
and "Romeo and Juliet"
so much.

10:46.104 --> 10:49.899
But then we forget
how fucking low the lows are.

10:49.941 --> 10:54.821
Romeo and Juliet die,
and the "Titanic" sinks.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.574
The highs are never
as high again,

10:57.615 --> 11:01.661
but the lows just
keep getting lower.

11:01.703 --> 11:06.207
* *

11:06.249 --> 11:09.544
- Here, I can help.
- Oh. Thank you.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.339
- Uh, are we lost?

11:12.380 --> 11:13.673
- No, no.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.342
Look,
we'll find it in the morning.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.968
It doesn't make sense
to look for it

11:17.010 --> 11:18.094
while it's dark, you know?

11:18.136 --> 11:19.095
- Uh-huh.

11:21.056 --> 11:23.141
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.851
- Maybe we should,
like, hunt, right?

11:24.893 --> 11:26.186
- You know how to hunt?
- No.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.771
Do you?
- I do not. No.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.148
- Fuck. Sam.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.610
[exhales]

11:33.651 --> 11:35.153
How long can we go
without water?

11:35.195 --> 11:36.571
- I think they say,
like, three days.

11:36.613 --> 11:37.655
- That's it?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.115
- But we're small, so maybe--

11:39.157 --> 11:40.700
maybe that means
we can go longer?

11:40.742 --> 11:42.410
- Yeah, okay.

11:44.287 --> 11:50.001
* *

11:50.043 --> 11:51.795
You want to go back, don't you?

11:51.836 --> 11:52.879
- No. No, no, no.

11:52.921 --> 11:56.383
I'm sorry. I'm okay.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.052
I think if we can't
find it in the morning,

11:59.094 --> 12:02.305
then we should probably...

12:02.347 --> 12:05.850
- [chuckling]

12:05.892 --> 12:10.105
[both laughing]

12:10.146 --> 12:11.940
- And in the end,

12:11.981 --> 12:15.068
everything just floats
in the middle.

12:15.110 --> 12:16.945
[chuckling] Maybe that's
the disappointment of t--

12:16.986 --> 12:18.655
[phone beeps]
[gasps]

12:18.697 --> 12:20.865
Time! Disappointment of time.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.410
Or disillusionment of time.
I--fuck. I don't know.

12:23.451 --> 12:26.788
I don't--I don't know
what I'm saying.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.249
This is kind of fucked up,
but, um, my husband Noah

12:29.290 --> 12:31.376
is asleep in the other room,
and I'm not telling him

12:31.418 --> 12:33.336
that I'm going
into the jungle,

12:33.378 --> 12:36.589
because he would try
to stop me.

12:36.631 --> 12:41.553
He treats me like I'm this
delicate little kid

12:41.594 --> 12:42.846
who can't take care
of herself.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.431
[insect buzzing]

12:44.472 --> 12:49.436
And, um, you know, he hasn't
always been like that.

12:49.477 --> 12:50.770
We took this vacation
to celebrate

12:50.812 --> 12:51.938
our wedding anniversary.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.606
It's been ten years.

12:53.648 --> 12:57.027
And, um, the entire process
has made me realize

12:57.068 --> 13:01.031
that my future
won't be as good as my past.

13:02.657 --> 13:05.201
- Emma?

13:05.243 --> 13:07.454
- I drink more now.
- Emma!

13:07.495 --> 13:08.955
- Like, I get home from work
and I pour a drink

13:08.997 --> 13:11.750
before I even say hi to Noah.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.502
And now, like, here,
with the drinks and the pool--

13:14.544 --> 13:17.547
and then half my tooth
broke off by the lazy river,

13:17.589 --> 13:19.966
and the other half
is fucking killing me.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.634
[gasps]
Um--oh, my God.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.595
Here's a dim realization
I think that I just made

13:23.636 --> 13:25.221
in this moment,
which is that vacation

13:25.263 --> 13:26.765
is kind of like life.

13:26.806 --> 13:30.310
It's fun at first,
and you try new things, right?

13:30.352 --> 13:33.355
And you're like,
new foods, new experiences.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.065
The sex with your partner
is more fun.

13:35.106 --> 13:36.441
And then at a certain point,

13:36.483 --> 13:40.278
you're just so fucking annoyed
with them.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.447
And you've done
all the excursions

13:42.489 --> 13:45.325
and you've tried all the food
and you get bad indigestion

13:45.367 --> 13:47.202
and you're too sore
and too lazy

13:47.243 --> 13:48.995
and hungover to do
anything but watch

13:49.037 --> 13:50.872
shitty true-crime shows
in your hotel bed,

13:50.914 --> 13:54.292
and then after a while,
you just want to go home.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.961
But then you get home,
and it isn't

13:57.003 --> 13:59.339
quite as good
as you remembered,

13:59.381 --> 14:02.092
so you just want
to go back on vacation.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.301
Sorry. I'm done.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.844
And I don't--I don't even know

14:04.886 --> 14:06.346
if you're gonna,
uh, hear this.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.598
- Oh, fuck.
- You have a good day.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.600
[phone beeps]

14:10.642 --> 14:13.019
[both breathing heavily]

14:13.061 --> 14:16.022
[helicopter blades whirring]

14:16.064 --> 14:19.025
[dramatic music]

14:19.067 --> 14:26.199
* *

14:34.833 --> 14:36.793
- [screams]
What are you doing here?

14:36.835 --> 14:38.670
- Oh, hey.
It's good to see you too.

14:38.712 --> 14:40.880
- You called in
a fucking helicopter?

14:40.922 --> 14:42.966
- No, how would I do that?

14:51.766 --> 14:53.893
- Ah! That was incredible!

14:53.935 --> 14:55.729
Hi!
- Ha, we found you too.

14:55.770 --> 14:58.732
- Hi!
- Double surprise!

14:58.773 --> 15:00.191
Thanks, Abigail.
Great pilot.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.832
- [grunts]
- Ooh, timber.

15:15.874 --> 15:17.375
- I did not think that this
morning would end up like this.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.711
So many adventures.
Thank you, Baltasar.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.296
- That's mine.
- Smile.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.089
- Is that really a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich?

15:23.131 --> 15:25.383
Oh, no, just peanut butter.
[chuckling]

15:25.425 --> 15:27.594
And then these three--
thank you.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.346
These three--
one, two, and three--

15:29.387 --> 15:31.431
they come chasing after us
in a golf cart.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.600
And I'm thinking that maybe
the helicopter was on fire,

15:33.641 --> 15:35.268
or maybe we were
gonna get hijacked.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.854
- By the way,
we heard about the Pasa-ha.

15:37.896 --> 15:41.024
I guess we'd all love to find
some room outside of time.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.275
But I'm too afraid to crawl

15:42.317 --> 15:43.860
down in some mole hole
to go underground.

15:43.902 --> 15:46.529
- Maybe it's worth it
that you face your fears,

15:46.571 --> 15:48.406
you know,
to see what's down there.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.075
- Well, what's down there
is a bunch of bullshit,

15:50.116 --> 15:51.201
so I'll just stay up here.

15:51.242 --> 15:52.535
- Stop, stop, stop.
- Anyway--

15:52.577 --> 15:53.453
- Can I talk to you
for a second, please?

15:53.495 --> 15:54.496
- Mm-hmm.
- It's whatever.

15:54.537 --> 15:55.580
Some people believe in God.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.874
Other people believe
in magical rooms

15:57.916 --> 16:02.420
suspended...in time.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.589
Oh, boy. That can't be good.

16:04.631 --> 16:08.885
- Luna says, um, they are
in a very specific stage,

16:08.927 --> 16:12.639
you know, called, um,
la pubertad de matrimonio.

16:12.681 --> 16:13.723
The puberty of marriage.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.558
- Ooh.
- Nothing worse than puberty.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.435
- Like, you didn't think
it'd be cool to, like,

16:17.477 --> 16:21.106
leave--leave a note
or--or anything at all?

16:23.108 --> 16:24.526
- I don't need you
to rescue me.

16:24.567 --> 16:25.902
- No, I'm not here
to rescue you.

16:25.944 --> 16:28.697
- Noah, I'm going to go
in there if I find it.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.323
- Mm-hmm.
- There's no stopping me.

16:30.365 --> 16:31.408
- No, no, you--you--
- There's no...

16:31.449 --> 16:32.867
- Yeah.
- Talking me out of it.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.202
- Yeah, no, you've made it
crystal fucking clear, so--

16:34.244 --> 16:36.287
- Then why are you here?

16:36.329 --> 16:37.497
Why are you here?

16:37.539 --> 16:38.998
You don't care
about any of this.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.458
You don't believe in any of it.
- No, you know what?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.419
But I--I do care about you.
-Mm-hmm.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.546
- And I'm not gonna
just stand by

16:44.587 --> 16:48.258
and let my wife
walk into a jungle alone.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.176
Are you kidding me?
I am not built like that.

16:50.218 --> 16:51.344
You know this.

16:51.386 --> 16:53.304
Like, I'm--
I'm not sure what's--

16:53.346 --> 16:55.557
what's next for us
after all this shit,

16:55.598 --> 16:57.559
but in the meantime,
we're married,

16:57.600 --> 16:58.977
and this is what
I signed up for.

16:59.019 --> 17:00.603
And if you could just be--
- Don't teach me a lesson.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.522
- If you could just--well,
maybe you need to learn one--

17:02.564 --> 17:03.940
- You talk to me
like I'm five years old.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.775
- You are so selfish.
- How am I being selfish?

17:05.817 --> 17:07.402
- If you could just take my
feelings into consideration--

17:07.444 --> 17:08.778
- I'm out here in the middle
of fucking nowhere--

17:08.820 --> 17:10.572
- Oh, don't---oh, my God--
- I'm doing all this--

17:10.613 --> 17:11.781
- I'm sorry, I'm just gonna
go over there.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.908
- That's a fantastic idea.
- Excuse me?

17:13.950 --> 17:16.036
- The king of giving
great marital advice.

17:16.077 --> 17:17.203
Can I have a sandwich?

17:17.245 --> 17:18.163
- What's that
supposed to mean, Ted?

17:18.204 --> 17:19.456
- I love you, but you are

17:19.497 --> 17:20.874
the worst one of all
to do this.

17:20.915 --> 17:22.417
- I think you--you should go.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.419
It would be very interesting
to see that human interaction.

17:24.461 --> 17:26.713
- Mm. I see what you're doing.
- Don't egg him on.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.590
- Oh, there is
no signal anywhere.

17:28.631 --> 17:29.841
- You're putting
words in my mouth.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.843
- What's going on?
- Where am I fucking up?

17:31.885 --> 17:33.803
- Your friends are
getting a divorce.

17:33.845 --> 17:36.473
- This is 100% for you.

17:36.514 --> 17:37.682
- And you coming here...
- This is for you.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.517
- Is 100% about you.
- Oh, Go--you know what?

17:39.559 --> 17:41.144
You haven't thought about me
since you left this morning.

17:41.186 --> 17:42.145
- I did.
- And that sucked.

17:42.187 --> 17:43.104
Oh, you did?
- Mm-hmm.

17:43.146 --> 17:44.314
- Okay, when?

17:44.356 --> 17:45.648
- I did think about
you this morning,

17:45.690 --> 17:47.567
and I decided that I need
something that is mine.

17:47.609 --> 17:49.319
- Okay, like wha--like,
the two missing kids?

17:49.361 --> 17:50.320
- No.
- Like, that's what you--

17:50.362 --> 17:51.613
- [stammers]
- Then what?

17:51.654 --> 17:53.239
- We're supposed to be
two separate people.

17:53.281 --> 17:54.449
We are not separate people
anymore.

17:54.491 --> 17:55.867
- Are we?
- We do everything together.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.535
Everything is always together.
- Okay--

17:57.577 --> 17:58.703
- We don't even have
our own friends anymore.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.871
We're like this--
- Is that bad?

17:59.913 --> 18:01.831
- Yeah, it is bad.

18:01.873 --> 18:04.250
- Wow. Wow, Em.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.502
You literally talk
about marriage

18:05.543 --> 18:07.921
like it's a fucking problem.

18:07.962 --> 18:09.464
- It is a problem.

18:13.677 --> 18:16.346
- Wow, you know--
[chuckling]

18:16.388 --> 18:17.889
You know what sucks?

18:20.350 --> 18:21.601
Like, I don't--I don't--

18:21.643 --> 18:24.938
I don't know if you
even like me anymore.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.023
That--that sucks.

18:27.065 --> 18:30.860
Like, that--like, do you want
to be married to me anymore,

18:30.902 --> 18:32.362
or, like, nah?

18:32.404 --> 18:34.864
[tense music]

18:34.906 --> 18:36.116
- [inhales]

18:36.157 --> 18:39.077
- [grunts] Okay.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.413
Okay. Good news.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.039
I'm catching a whiff
of something pungent

18:43.081 --> 18:44.374
coming from the west.

18:44.416 --> 18:46.209
So I'm gonna check that out
before nightfall.

18:46.251 --> 18:47.961
You guys set up camp
in the trees.

18:48.003 --> 18:50.880
Never go into the tall grass
after dark.

18:50.922 --> 18:52.674
Never.

18:52.716 --> 18:55.385
I've only got three tents,
so you might want to think

18:55.427 --> 18:57.429
about getting along
at some point.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.055
- Well, I think
the Teds are out of here.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.974
- Ooh, could we get a quick pic
by the helicopter?

19:01.016 --> 19:02.267
- Okay, okay.
I got it.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.727
- Who's taking it? Ted.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.520

re-up for another seven years?

19:28.460 --> 19:29.919
- I'd give it 50/50.

20:30.313 --> 20:31.815
that Iberra was full of shit.

20:31.856 --> 20:34.567
- Yeah, well, maybe,
but still, like,

20:34.609 --> 20:39.072
what is outside of time
versus inside of time?

20:39.114 --> 20:43.702
It seems like Pasaje is
about reliving a moment, no?

20:43.743 --> 20:46.705
Or having a glimpse
into the future.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.249

when I turned 35?

21:03.930 --> 21:05.682

I didn't want to have a party.

21:05.724 --> 21:07.559
You know,
I was feeling very old.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.853
So that day,
I was feeling miserable.

And I was--I was
so depressed, at 10:00 p.m.,

21:13.481 --> 21:16.860
I was in my bathroom
crying, taking a shit.

21:16.901 --> 21:19.654
And suddenly, I hear
a knock on the door.

21:19.696 --> 21:23.366
And Luna and Alex,
these fucking assholes,

21:23.408 --> 21:24.409

Okay. Uh...

Yeah, you know, if any
of this shit is real,

22:05.533 --> 22:06.951
I, uh--I think I would--

22:06.993 --> 22:09.245
I would want to go
a year from now.

22:09.287 --> 22:12.874

how Emma and I are doing.

we'll be doing?

just another vampire

Spread to her brain.

I'm sorry,

that's not, you know--

24:20.794 --> 24:23.797
I know that's not helpful.

24:23.838 --> 24:26.257
That must have been impossible.

- Mm-hmm.

to caregiver.

for me, is a bonus.

to Violet.

where we were.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.301
maybe I can.

No, that's bullshit.

- Good.

33:08.780 --> 33:10.156
- I passed out too.

33:10.198 --> 33:11.366

33:25.588 --> 33:27.173
Well, I guess we don't
have to hash it out

33:27.215 --> 33:30.635
about the tooth, huh?
