00:42.976 --> 00:44.671
Hey, Layla.

00:44.944 --> 00:46.912
Have you been a good girl?

00:49.349 --> 00:51.317
You're just hungry.

00:51.618 --> 00:53.347
Come on, girl.

01:22.649 --> 01:25.049
Yeah, me too.

01:44.404 --> 01:46.838
Come on, Audrey, you can do this.

02:24.010 --> 02:28.174
<i>The patients are beginning to speak
of a presence in the clinic.</i>

02:28.982 --> 02:31.041
<i>Something they can feel.</i>

02:31.251 --> 02:33.344
<i>Something I can feel.</i>

02:33.553 --> 02:37.114
<i>Something I don't dare admit
I've felt before.</i>

02:40.560 --> 02:43.859
<i>While I continue to explain away
the Boogeyman's existence...</i>

02:44.063 --> 02:47.260
<i>...as nothing but the darkness
within ourselves...</i>

02:47.467 --> 02:49.196
<i>...I'm left to wonder...</i>

02:49.402 --> 02:52.235
<i>...does that make him anything less
than real?</i>

04:55.995 --> 04:57.394
Layla, no.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.428
It's time for bed.

05:32.532 --> 05:33.965
Layla?

05:39.839 --> 05:42.501
Layla, are you okay?

05:49.248 --> 05:51.045
What's wrong, girl?

05:51.250 --> 05:53.445
Did you hurt yourself?

06:44.804 --> 06:46.863
And we're back.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.439
<i>You're listening to Headspace
on WZXB...</i>

06:49.642 --> 06:51.075
...Wolfbridge University radio.

06:51.277 --> 06:54.804
I'm Sarah Morris and as always,
I'm here with Dr. Roger Kane...

06:55.014 --> 06:57.448
...psychiatrist and head of
Wolfbridge's Psychology Department.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.909
And we've got Liam on the line.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.849
Liam, how can we help you?

07:03.055 --> 07:05.546
<i>Yeah, this is a question for Sarah.</i>

07:06.225 --> 07:07.351
Fire away, Liam.

07:07.560 --> 07:11.553
<i>I listen to your show every night.
You have a really sexy voice.</i>

07:11.764 --> 07:12.856
<i>Really.</i>

07:13.065 --> 07:14.657
What exactly is your question?

07:14.867 --> 07:18.564
<i>So, what do you say, Sarah?
Can I take you out sometime?</i>

07:19.338 --> 07:21.203
Sorry, Liam, my boyfriend
is understanding,

07:21.407 --> 07:23.272
but not that understanding.

07:23.476 --> 07:26.570
<i>So I guess a blowjob's completely out
of the question?</i>

07:28.481 --> 07:29.470
Not necessarily.

07:29.882 --> 07:32.112
Just bend down as far as you can,
open up wide...

07:32.318 --> 07:33.683
...and give it your best shot.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.254
Our next call is from Eric.
Eric, how are you tonight?

07:39.459 --> 07:40.983
<i>Okay, I guess.</i>

07:41.194 --> 07:43.025
<i>Actually, not so good.</i>

07:43.229 --> 07:45.197
<i>My girlfriend broke up
with me last week...</i>

07:45.398 --> 07:47.866
<i>...and I've been having a hard time
dealing with it.</i>

07:48.267 --> 07:50.167
Sounds like you really cared
about her.

07:50.369 --> 07:51.893
<i>Yeah, I still do.</i>

07:52.104 --> 07:53.537
<i>I think it was all my fault.</i>

07:53.940 --> 07:57.432
<i>Well, I'm a freshman
and I haven't made that many friends.</i>

07:57.643 --> 08:00.077
<i>I guess I just need
someone to talk to.</i>

08:00.279 --> 08:03.214
Well, that's why we're here, Eric.
Fire away.

08:17.964 --> 08:19.363
Hey, you still here?

08:19.565 --> 08:21.999
Hi. Just putting
the finishing touches...

08:22.201 --> 08:24.431
...on my ultimate breakup CD.

08:24.637 --> 08:26.468
You know,
one of the cry-in-your-beer...

08:26.672 --> 08:29.402
...women-are-nothing-but-cray
manipulative-bitches variety.

08:29.609 --> 08:30.769
For that last caller?

08:32.111 --> 08:34.135
I had Brandon get his info
before he hung up.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.009
- Sarah...
- I know. I just...

08:37.216 --> 08:38.547
He seemed so sad.

08:39.051 --> 08:42.077
You know, he was blaming himself
for everything he's going through...

08:42.621 --> 08:44.988
...and I knew what that feels like.

08:45.591 --> 08:46.853
I'm proud of you.

08:47.059 --> 08:48.754
What you've overcome
this past year...

08:49.495 --> 08:52.328
It's gonna make you
a great psychiatrist one day.

08:53.766 --> 08:54.926
I don't need to explain...

08:55.134 --> 08:58.160
...why a psychiatrist should never
hand-deliver a sappy mix CD...

08:58.371 --> 09:01.135
...to a broken-hearted
patient's bedroom, do I?

09:01.340 --> 09:04.400
It's a good thing
I'm not a psychiatrist yet.

09:04.610 --> 09:07.443
I'm serious.
Never underestimate the influence...

09:07.647 --> 09:09.672
...your words
and actions have on others.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.540
- Okay.
- See you.

09:12.752 --> 09:14.219
Bye.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.670
Thank you very much.

09:44.450 --> 09:47.942
This is more than a spoonful.
This is like a Mama Jug, huh, right?

09:48.154 --> 09:51.248
- Well, hello sweet cheeks.
- Don't touch my tits.

09:51.457 --> 09:53.425
That's the property
of Alpha Sigma Theta.

09:53.626 --> 09:55.150
Did you see that guy?

09:57.930 --> 10:01.593
I'm telling you, guys, I fucking aced
my poetry final this morning.

10:01.801 --> 10:03.564
- Poetry? Seriously?
- Yeah, man.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.567
My professor says
I'm the next rock poet in the making.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.967
My very own Jim Morrison.

10:09.175 --> 10:10.472
Who?

10:12.545 --> 10:14.274
What do you got there, Lukas?

10:14.480 --> 10:18.712
It looks like... I don't know.
Grilled shit on a bun?

10:20.853 --> 10:22.980
People actually get paid
to make this shit.

10:23.623 --> 10:27.389
- Should have went to culinary school.
- You're killing in bong hits and games.

10:27.593 --> 10:29.185
You might as well stick to that.

10:32.264 --> 10:34.425
Did you talk to your dad
about winter break yet?

10:35.067 --> 10:38.036
Yeah, I told him I was going home
with you and he's fine with it.

10:38.237 --> 10:41.172
Really? That is so awesome.
My family's gonna love you so much.

10:45.611 --> 10:47.238
So has anyone heard from Audrey?

10:48.581 --> 10:51.448
I left a message on her cell,
I just haven't heard back yet.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.710
Wow, the murders are all over
the news. It's...

10:53.919 --> 10:56.353
- I didn't realie her dad was a big deal.
- He's huge.

10:56.555 --> 10:59.524
He's been published
in every major Psych journal.

10:59.725 --> 11:02.023
Maybe I should try her cell again.

11:02.595 --> 11:05.928
Maybe you should give her some time.
She may not wanna talk about it yet.

11:07.266 --> 11:09.234
Yeah, I know.
I'm just worried about her.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.629
Jeremy, Jeremy,
little bit of vitamin C?

11:13.839 --> 11:15.773
That's my tiggity.

11:17.043 --> 11:18.635
I look so stupid without the one.

11:21.147 --> 11:23.274
All right, well, ta-ta.

11:23.482 --> 11:25.541
- Later, Ben.
- Did you see him?

11:35.728 --> 11:38.561
I'm never taking a shower again.

11:38.764 --> 11:40.732
- You showered in your bikini?
- Yeah.

11:40.933 --> 11:43.959
Some perv fraternity is making
their pledges install webcams...

11:44.170 --> 11:45.831
...in the girls' showers.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.335
- Yeah.
- Oh, come on.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.599
- I hear that story twice a semester.
- No.

11:49.809 --> 11:53.711
A girl in my theater class told me
that it happened to...

11:54.313 --> 11:57.077
It happened to, like, one of her friends
in another dorm.

11:57.283 --> 12:00.411
Hearsay. There's no way that
that's true.

12:00.619 --> 12:02.484
Well, I'm not taking any chances.

12:02.688 --> 12:05.316
I'm not ending up on the Internet
like last time.

12:17.369 --> 12:19.667
Your dad left another message.

12:20.773 --> 12:21.762
Yeah, I got it.

12:24.143 --> 12:26.611
He thinks you're coming home
for the holidays.

12:28.314 --> 12:31.442
I'll call him. Just as soon
as this term paper is out of the way.

12:31.650 --> 12:34.710
- How's it coming?
- Oh, so incredibly slow.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.388
- Yeah?
- Yeah, at this rate, I'll be up all night.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.887
Oh, okay.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.355
Well, in that case...

12:43.596 --> 12:46.861
...I am going to Jeremy's room.

12:47.366 --> 12:50.529
- I will see you in the morning.
- Oh, have some sex for me.

12:51.237 --> 12:53.797
Oh, you know I will. Oh, yeah.

12:54.006 --> 12:57.635
That's so unfair. Bye.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.578
Lindsay?

13:43.622 --> 13:45.385
Audrey?

13:47.326 --> 13:49.226
What's going on?

13:53.065 --> 13:55.431
Oh, my God, are you okay?

13:56.001 --> 13:57.491
Hey.

13:59.205 --> 14:00.604
He's trying to kill me.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.274
Who's trying to kill you?

14:06.345 --> 14:07.937
The Boogeyman.

14:09.081 --> 14:12.448
He killed my dad
and now he's trying to kill me too.

14:12.985 --> 14:16.250
I'm sorry, Sarah.
I didn't know where else to go.

14:16.455 --> 14:19.720
Audrey,
the Boogeyman didn't kill your dad.

14:20.159 --> 14:21.649
He did.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.957
I've seen him.

14:24.897 --> 14:27.058
He's everywhere.

14:27.566 --> 14:29.693
I thought I got away...

14:29.902 --> 14:31.392
...but he keeps following me.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.094
Sarah...

14:33.305 --> 14:35.205
...I don't wanna die.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.633
You're not gonna die.

14:39.745 --> 14:41.212
Come here.

14:46.585 --> 14:47.574
Hey...

14:50.222 --> 14:53.385
...I'm gonna help you through this,
I promise.

14:57.696 --> 15:00.324
You're gonna sleep here tonight,
okay?

15:08.374 --> 15:11.172
It doesn't matter where I sleep.

15:13.212 --> 15:15.271
He'll still find me.

16:00.926 --> 16:02.553
Where are you going?

16:06.165 --> 16:09.362
I'm just going to get some water,
okay?

16:09.568 --> 16:11.126
Lt'll just take a minute.

16:11.337 --> 16:13.032
Just try and go back to sleep.

16:13.238 --> 16:14.728
I'll be right back.

17:33.018 --> 17:34.781
Sarah?

17:47.366 --> 17:49.061
Sarah?

17:50.436 --> 17:52.267
Are you in here?

18:22.301 --> 18:25.930
Help! Somebody open the door!

18:26.672 --> 18:28.037
Open this door!

18:52.598 --> 18:54.589
Audrey, what's wrong?

18:56.101 --> 18:59.002
We have to go. Now.

18:59.204 --> 19:00.865
He's in here.

19:01.073 --> 19:05.066
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
There's nobody in here. Look.

19:07.946 --> 19:10.414
Look, everything is gonna be okay.

19:10.949 --> 19:12.439
Stop saying that, Sarah.

19:13.051 --> 19:14.541
Everything is not gonna be okay.

19:14.753 --> 19:16.015
Wait. Audrey.

19:19.958 --> 19:21.357
Audrey, wait. Audrey.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.549
He tried to get me.

19:22.761 --> 19:24.558
Audrey...

19:26.632 --> 19:28.293
Audrey, what happened?

19:28.500 --> 19:29.660
Nothing.

19:29.868 --> 19:31.699
Just go away.

19:32.404 --> 19:35.305
Oh, please open the door
and talk to me.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.604
Audrey?

20:03.735 --> 20:05.430
Ben. Hey, is David here?

20:05.637 --> 20:07.798
Hey, morning.

20:10.309 --> 20:13.176
- So you finally cut his tongue out?
- Yeah.

20:13.378 --> 20:16.040
Hell week. He can't talk to anyone
but his pledge brothers.

20:16.248 --> 20:20.878
Oh, so the Greek system
truly does provide community service.

20:23.021 --> 20:24.113
Bye.

20:28.427 --> 20:30.327
- You look stressed.
- Audrey's back.

20:31.196 --> 20:34.654
She thinks the Boogeyman
killed her dad.

20:35.467 --> 20:38.129
- What?
- She's convinced he wants to kill her.

20:38.337 --> 20:40.237
Will you check in on her
and make sure she's okay?

20:40.439 --> 20:43.306
- I've got finals and the radio show.
- Oh, yeah, no, of course.

20:43.508 --> 20:45.942
Thanks. I left a note for Lindsay.
Gotta go, I'm late.

20:46.144 --> 20:47.236
Well, hey...

20:47.446 --> 20:48.435
...are you okay?

20:49.214 --> 20:50.772
Fine.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.180
I promise.

21:04.663 --> 21:06.528
And we're ready for our next caller.

21:06.732 --> 21:09.724
Hi, you're on with Sarah
and Dr. Kane.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.562
Caller, do you have a question?

21:15.307 --> 21:16.797
Hi.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.643
I'm being stalked.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.511
<i>- It's Audrey.
- He won't leave me alone.</i>

21:25.717 --> 21:30.620
I don't know what else to do.
He just follows me everywhere I go.

21:30.822 --> 21:33.689
<i>Is he a friend, a boyfriend?</i>

21:35.227 --> 21:37.991
I'm afraid we need to know
about your situation fully...

21:38.196 --> 21:39.857
...in order to help you.

21:40.365 --> 21:42.492
<i>You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.</i>

21:43.168 --> 21:45.159
Why wouldn't we believe you?

21:46.238 --> 21:48.706
Because you don't believe
in the Boogeyman.

21:49.207 --> 21:51.607
What exactly do you mean
by the Boogeyman?

21:51.810 --> 21:53.903
<i>He killed my dad...</i>

21:55.180 --> 21:56.738
<i>...and those other people.</i>

22:00.018 --> 22:01.713
I'm next.

22:04.456 --> 22:08.017
Your father was one of those killed
at the Hillridge Clinic. I'm very sorry.

22:08.226 --> 22:10.285
You must be experiencing
a great deal of pain.

22:10.829 --> 22:14.128
Look, I know you don't believe me...

22:15.300 --> 22:16.597
...but you will.

22:18.270 --> 22:20.864
<i>Once I'm dead,
you'll know I was right.</i>

22:23.809 --> 22:26.676
Call campus security and get
someone over to Hammonds Hall.

22:26.878 --> 22:30.780
- Which room?
- 403. Her name is Audrey Allen.

22:30.982 --> 22:33.280
Tell them she may be suicidal.

22:34.252 --> 22:35.719
Sarah?

22:35.921 --> 22:37.445
Sarah?

22:39.524 --> 22:40.821
Hello?

22:42.694 --> 22:45.288
Let's begin
by clarifying a few things.

22:58.577 --> 23:00.135
<i>I understand your father
was killed...</i>

23:00.345 --> 23:02.939
...by a man
who thought he was the Boogeyman.

23:03.782 --> 23:06.910
No. No. Look, it was him.

23:07.119 --> 23:10.111
I've tried to tell Sarah
but she won't listen.

23:10.322 --> 23:13.018
I wouldn't believe me either
but it's the truth.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.420
He's real.

23:15.827 --> 23:17.192
I don't know what to do.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.296
<i>You do realize the Boogeyman
is a legend?</i>

23:19.498 --> 23:23.332
One that a very sick man used
as an excuse to hurt your father...

23:23.869 --> 23:25.769
<i>...but a legend nonetheless.</i>

23:26.705 --> 23:29.674
I found my dad's journal.

23:29.875 --> 23:32.139
Look, he knew
the Boogeyman was real.

23:32.511 --> 23:35.173
He knew he was gonna die.

23:35.380 --> 23:39.282
Look, my dad was trying to help
those people before they all...

24:15.153 --> 24:17.018
Hello, caller? Are you there?

24:25.297 --> 24:27.128
Caller, are you there?

24:27.799 --> 24:29.289
Hello?

24:32.204 --> 24:33.398
Yeah.

24:34.806 --> 24:35.830
I'm still here.

24:46.384 --> 24:47.976
Hello, caller? Are you there?

24:48.186 --> 24:49.175
Hello?

25:16.281 --> 25:18.374
- What's going on?
- Someone's attacking Audrey.

25:18.583 --> 25:20.517
- What?
- He's strangling her.

25:22.554 --> 25:24.715
Jesus Christ.

25:30.962 --> 25:34.090
Look, stay here. Stay here.
I'll call the police.

26:12.771 --> 26:14.830
You sure you're gonna be okay?

26:15.473 --> 26:18.033
All right, if we need anything else,
we'll call you.

26:30.488 --> 26:32.479
Did you tell them what you saw?

26:39.130 --> 26:41.894
Sarah, are you all right?
What happened?

26:43.134 --> 26:44.999
I heard someone say that Audrey...

26:47.539 --> 26:48.699
That she...

26:49.741 --> 26:51.606
It's not true, is it?

26:55.680 --> 26:57.079
She hung herself with a belt.

26:57.482 --> 26:58.744
Jee.

27:07.425 --> 27:09.825
I think I'm getting sick again.

27:13.865 --> 27:15.730
You feel fine to me.

27:17.936 --> 27:21.702
No, I mean sick.
Sick the way I was last year.

27:25.877 --> 27:28.710
I saw something in Audrey's room.

27:30.281 --> 27:32.806
Something that wasn't really there.

27:35.687 --> 27:37.416
What did you see?

27:41.393 --> 27:42.690
If you don't wanna talk about it...

27:42.894 --> 27:46.421
I saw someone standing over Audrey
like they had strangled her.

27:48.466 --> 27:50.058
Who was it?

27:51.770 --> 27:53.499
I don't know.

27:54.906 --> 27:56.999
Sarah, you were in shock.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.406
You witnessed one
of your best friends die tonight.

28:01.446 --> 28:04.415
- It's probably...
- It's the same way my mom died.

28:06.951 --> 28:08.543
What if it triggered something?

28:08.887 --> 28:11.913
Something that I thought
wasn't there anymore?

28:12.657 --> 28:13.988
No.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.057
Sarah, listen to me.

28:17.729 --> 28:20.027
After what you've been through
tonight...

28:21.332 --> 28:25.291
...you could tell me you saw
a herd of pink elephants...

28:25.570 --> 28:29.597
...in Audrey's room and I'd still think
you're the sanest girl I know.

29:33.037 --> 29:34.299
Hello?

29:35.607 --> 29:37.165
Hey.

29:37.408 --> 29:38.932
Katie...

29:39.244 --> 29:40.268
...hey.

29:40.478 --> 29:42.343
Sorry,
I'm a little jumpy this morning.

29:42.547 --> 29:43.775
I think we all are.

29:43.982 --> 29:46.416
They asked me
to pack up Audrey's things.

29:46.618 --> 29:50.281
- Already?
- Yeah, dorms close in 48 hours.

30:10.775 --> 30:13.209
You two were pretty close, huh?

30:14.445 --> 30:16.276
Yeah, we were.

30:18.783 --> 30:20.580
Hey, where should I send her stuff?

30:20.785 --> 30:23.618
The only contact listed was her dad.

30:27.192 --> 30:28.557
He was all she had left.

30:38.770 --> 30:42.672
Well, if there's anything of hers
that you'd like to keep...

30:43.641 --> 30:45.768
Yeah, I think there is.

30:55.119 --> 30:56.882
Thanks, Katie.

31:08.466 --> 31:09.490
He ain't here.

31:09.701 --> 31:10.929
- Where is he?
- Study group.

31:12.637 --> 31:16.437
Sarah, by the way,
I'm really sorry about your friend.

31:16.641 --> 31:19.269
A bunch of us were listening
to your show when she called in.

31:19.477 --> 31:20.739
It was pretty freaky shit.

31:21.846 --> 31:23.973
If there's anything I can do...

31:24.182 --> 31:26.980
- Thanks. Tell David I stopped by.
- Yeah, sure.

31:42.367 --> 31:44.835
I just can't stop thinking
about it, man.

31:45.036 --> 31:46.901
She said someone strangled her.

31:47.105 --> 31:50.268
Yeah, well, she was confused.

31:50.475 --> 31:52.739
I'm just saying it's fucking freaky.

31:52.944 --> 31:55.879
So am I helping you
pack your clothes...

31:56.080 --> 31:58.708
...or am I simply packing them?

32:02.954 --> 32:03.978
- Come in.
- Come in.

32:10.695 --> 32:13.858
Careful. I got high
just walking down the hallway.

32:14.065 --> 32:15.794
Everything okay?

32:16.067 --> 32:18.297
I found something in Audrey's room.

32:18.503 --> 32:19.800
Her dad's private journal.

32:20.872 --> 32:22.567
Audrey was right about her dad.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.867
He did believe
the Boogeyman was real.

32:25.076 --> 32:28.739
He thought he was some kind
of physical manifestation of our fears.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.142
Well, you said
he was a respected psychologist.

32:31.349 --> 32:33.579
He never told anyone
what he wrote in the journal.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.912
He was afraid
his patients would suffer for it.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.781
More like his career.

32:37.989 --> 32:40.651
His theory was that his patients
were susceptible to the Boogeyman...

32:40.858 --> 32:43.292
...because they believed in him.

32:43.661 --> 32:45.856
When you said
Audrey was strangled...

32:46.064 --> 32:47.258
...who did you think...?

32:47.699 --> 32:50.896
- I mean, you didn't...
- Let's change the subject, okay?

32:51.336 --> 32:55.363
I just can't believe her nutjob dad was
in charge of helping those patients.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.298
It's strange. Even though
his theories are illogical...

32:58.509 --> 33:01.239
...he doesn't come off
like a raving lunatic in the journal.

33:01.446 --> 33:03.937
He articulates his thoughts clearly.

33:04.148 --> 33:05.172
Come on, Sarah.

33:05.383 --> 33:08.784
I mean, if you believe a word
of what was in that journal...

33:08.987 --> 33:11.080
...you're as cray as he was.

33:11.789 --> 33:13.086
What?

33:15.093 --> 33:16.890
That's not what I said.

33:17.095 --> 33:18.289
Shit, sorry.

33:18.496 --> 33:21.226
- I just meant that...
- Don't worry about it. It's cool.

33:21.766 --> 33:23.597
You're almost all done packing.

33:23.801 --> 33:26.736
I've just been procrastinating.
I should probably get started.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.371
Right this second? Stick around.

33:28.573 --> 33:29.870
That's okay.

33:30.074 --> 33:32.042
I'll see you guys later.

33:35.947 --> 33:38.279
Hello? Earth to Captain Oblivious?

33:38.483 --> 33:41.316
- It came out the wrong way.
- Yeah.

34:00.471 --> 34:02.962
<i>You have one new message.</i>

34:03.174 --> 34:06.075
<i>Sarah, it's your dad.</i>

34:06.577 --> 34:09.545
<i>You're probably busy with finals...</i>

34:10.715 --> 34:13.684
<i>...but I was wondering when
you were planning on coming home.</i>

34:14.685 --> 34:17.552
<i>I haven't seen you
since the funeral...</i>

34:18.188 --> 34:19.713
<i>...and well, anyway...</i>

34:20.725 --> 34:22.784
<i>...I can't wait to see you.</i>

34:22.994 --> 34:24.859
<i>Bye, sweetie.</i>

34:25.929 --> 34:28.864
<i>To delete this message,
press seven.</i>

34:48.152 --> 34:49.880
Damn it.

34:51.922 --> 34:53.447
Hey, what happened?

34:54.559 --> 34:57.392
I just had a fight
with the window shade.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.324
You kick its ass?

34:59.530 --> 35:00.827
No, the other way around.

35:01.032 --> 35:02.499
That's all right.

35:02.700 --> 35:04.167
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

35:05.903 --> 35:07.393
I thought you guys were packing.

35:07.605 --> 35:09.573
Yeah, I was packing.

35:10.308 --> 35:12.435
Now we're taking a break...

35:12.643 --> 35:15.043
...and you are coming
to grab a bite with us.

35:15.246 --> 35:17.976
I'm not feeling so well
so I think I'm just gonna go to bed.

35:18.182 --> 35:19.615
Bed?

35:19.817 --> 35:21.409
There's no bed in finals week.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.686
- I didn't get much sleep last night.
- Yeah, who did?

35:25.823 --> 35:26.949
Hey, come on.

35:27.158 --> 35:29.683
You know, it might do us some good
to get out of here.

35:29.894 --> 35:32.727
You guys go ahead. Seriously.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.656
- Come on.
- Okay.

35:35.867 --> 35:36.856
See you later.

35:38.302 --> 35:40.133
Okay, have fun.

36:49.707 --> 36:51.436
Lighter, check.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.534
Bong, check.

36:55.413 --> 36:57.608
Ignite.

37:28.112 --> 37:29.170
Oh, shit.

37:37.388 --> 37:38.514
Shit.

37:39.590 --> 37:40.784
Shit.

37:43.728 --> 37:45.286
Oh, shit.

37:45.496 --> 37:47.487
I gotta stop smoking.

37:53.070 --> 37:55.004
I gotta stop smoking.
I gotta stop smoking.

37:55.406 --> 37:56.703
I gotta go to rehab.

37:56.907 --> 37:59.501
I gotta do something. I gotta stop.

39:48.452 --> 39:50.010
Hello?

41:09.133 --> 41:10.259
Lukas?

41:11.035 --> 41:12.366
Lukas.

41:14.905 --> 41:16.497
What the hell is going on?

41:17.074 --> 41:18.871
Lukas, answer me.

41:20.611 --> 41:21.839
What happened to you?

42:19.436 --> 42:21.233
Sarah, hey.
Whoa, whoa, what happened?

42:21.438 --> 42:22.928
We have to find Lukas. He's hurt.

42:23.140 --> 42:24.903
Lukas? How did he get hurt?
I don't...

42:25.109 --> 42:27.100
I saw him in the kitchen.
He was bleeding.

42:27.311 --> 42:28.869
He had glass in his mouth.

42:29.079 --> 42:31.707
Glass? Sarah, are you sure
there was glass in his mouth?

42:31.916 --> 42:34.510
Yes, but everything was different.

42:34.718 --> 42:37.881
- Different? How were things different?
- Hey, what are you guys doing?

42:38.088 --> 42:40.886
- Have you seen Lukas?
- Lukas? No, we've been at dinner.

42:41.091 --> 42:43.150
- Why? What's wrong?
- Can you help me find him?

42:43.360 --> 42:47.023
- Can we look in your room?
- Sure. Come on.

42:50.768 --> 42:52.736
He's not here.

42:52.937 --> 42:54.905
He's probably just out
studying somewhere.

42:55.105 --> 42:56.299
Yeah, or getting smashed.

42:56.507 --> 42:58.099
Why are you so worried
about Lukas?

42:58.309 --> 43:01.836
I saw him in the kitchen with blood
and glass pouring out of his mouth.

43:02.046 --> 43:04.947
- Well, are you sure it was Lukas?
- Yes, I'm positive.

43:05.149 --> 43:07.344
Well, I'll call his mobile.

43:07.551 --> 43:09.519
Did he say anything?
Tell you what happened?

43:09.720 --> 43:13.349
No, he tried to talk but he couldn't.
And then somebody grabbed me...

43:13.557 --> 43:14.956
Wait. Who grabbed you?

43:15.159 --> 43:16.558
Lukas...

43:16.760 --> 43:19.991
...it's Jeremy. Look, man, give me
a ring when you get this, yeah?

43:20.197 --> 43:22.392
- Voice mail.
- Sarah, who grabbed you?

43:24.201 --> 43:27.068
It was the same person
I saw in Audrey's room last night.

43:27.271 --> 43:28.738
You mean...

43:29.273 --> 43:30.638
...the Boogeyman?

43:32.042 --> 43:36.001
I know how it sounds. I do. But...

43:36.213 --> 43:37.874
Sarah.

43:38.282 --> 43:43.083
It sounds like you had
a horrible fucking nightmare.

43:43.287 --> 43:46.256
I've had dreams like that before.
I mean, they're so real, they're freaky.

43:46.457 --> 43:47.890
This was different.

43:48.092 --> 43:50.253
Sarah,
you're probably just exhausted...

43:50.461 --> 43:54.329
...and everything will seem clearer
to you in the morning.

44:03.207 --> 44:05.402
Yeah, I don't know. Maybe.

44:05.943 --> 44:07.570
Sarah, wait.

44:09.647 --> 44:10.671
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:10.881 --> 44:13.179
Yeah, I'm gonna stay
with her tonight.

44:13.384 --> 44:15.284
Yeah, good idea.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.420
- Let me know if you hear from Lukas.
- Yeah.

44:17.621 --> 44:18.713
Okay.

44:18.922 --> 44:20.184
Bye.

44:26.530 --> 44:29.761
I can only come up
with one logical explanation.

44:30.734 --> 44:33.225
- It's happening again.
- What do you mean?

44:33.837 --> 44:36.465
Me seeing things that aren't there.

44:39.376 --> 44:40.968
You know...

44:41.612 --> 44:43.580
...maybe it wouldn't be
such a bad thing...

44:43.781 --> 44:45.373
...if you went home for the holidays.

44:45.916 --> 44:48.749
This has nothing to do
with where I spend the holidays.

44:54.692 --> 44:56.250
Okay, look.

44:56.694 --> 45:01.358
Yeah, it's been
a fucking rough 24 hours...

45:02.700 --> 45:04.167
...but that's all this means.

45:05.135 --> 45:07.000
Two days from now,
you're gonna be away...

45:07.204 --> 45:09.434
...from everything
that's happened here.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.107
Relaxing.

45:11.308 --> 45:12.832
I know.

45:13.343 --> 45:15.243
Don't worry about this.

45:16.013 --> 45:17.605
You're fine.

45:17.815 --> 45:19.248
I know you are.

46:00.924 --> 46:02.619
Fuck.

46:30.187 --> 46:32.121
Jeremy.

46:33.157 --> 46:34.590
Hello?

46:36.627 --> 46:38.390
Is someone there?

47:17.201 --> 47:19.465
Lukas? Is that you?

47:20.704 --> 47:23.172
Hey, where are you going, man?
Lukas?

47:25.676 --> 47:27.507
Lukas?

47:32.950 --> 47:34.884
What the fuck?

47:35.085 --> 47:36.882
Lukas, mate.

47:54.171 --> 47:55.798
Shit.

48:12.422 --> 48:14.413
What the fuck?

48:31.208 --> 48:33.802
What the fuck?

48:34.011 --> 48:35.911
Oh, my God.

48:39.983 --> 48:41.507
Help!

48:42.185 --> 48:43.880
Help!

49:04.408 --> 49:07.241
That's the worst sound in the world.

49:21.925 --> 49:24.120
Lindsay, where's your cell phone?

49:36.473 --> 49:38.668
Hey, Jeremy never called.

49:38.875 --> 49:41.537
Do you think that means
he didn't hear from Lukas?

49:42.446 --> 49:44.744
Or it was late when he did.

49:57.327 --> 49:59.795
Jeremy? Lukas?

50:58.021 --> 51:00.854
<i>Hey, it's me. Leave a word, mate.</i>

51:37.561 --> 51:40.553
Well, everyone deals with stress
in different ways.

51:40.764 --> 51:43.790
Some people completely lose interest
in sex, while others...

51:44.000 --> 51:45.297
<i>Not my boyfriend.</i>

51:45.502 --> 51:49.165
<i>He says sex is the only way
he can relieve stress.</i>

51:49.573 --> 51:51.097
If it's affecting your studies...

51:51.308 --> 51:53.367
...you need to tell him
there are other ways...

51:53.577 --> 51:55.875
<i>What if he doesn't understand?</i>

51:56.513 --> 51:59.880
<i>Sarah,
what do you think I should do?</i>

52:01.985 --> 52:03.543
<i>Hello?</i>

52:04.888 --> 52:06.446
<i>Hello?</i>

52:07.824 --> 52:09.792
Just be open and honest
with your boyfriend.

52:09.993 --> 52:12.086
And if he disregards
your concerns...

52:12.295 --> 52:15.264
...then there's a much larger problem
with your relationship.

52:15.465 --> 52:17.365
<i>That's what I was afraid of.</i>

52:17.567 --> 52:19.865
<i>Okay, well, thanks for the advice.</i>

52:20.570 --> 52:23.004
That's what we're here for,
right, Sarah?

52:24.474 --> 52:26.066
That's right.

52:26.276 --> 52:30.042
Finals week is stressful so we're doing
extra shows this week to help you out.

52:30.981 --> 52:34.246
Great. Thank you for listening.
We'll be right back.

52:34.451 --> 52:36.180
Sorry.

52:36.887 --> 52:38.855
It's okay. It's all right.

52:39.489 --> 52:40.854
- Wanna take a breather?
- Yeah.

52:41.057 --> 52:42.581
Come on. Let's take a break.

52:42.792 --> 52:44.419
<i>- Yeah.
- They're around somewhere.</i>

52:44.628 --> 52:46.459
Yeah, I know.

52:46.663 --> 52:48.790
But, Linds,
will you just check in on them?

52:48.999 --> 52:51.229
Make sure they're okay.
I'm just getting worried.

52:51.434 --> 52:54.597
<i>- Yeah, of course I will.
- Thanks.</i>

52:54.804 --> 52:57.170
I gotta go. I'll call you back.

52:58.642 --> 52:59.870
I'm sorry.

53:00.076 --> 53:02.738
I know I've been distracted.

53:02.946 --> 53:05.471
A couple of my friends are missing
and I've...

53:05.682 --> 53:07.843
I've been seeing things again.

53:08.051 --> 53:09.916
What kind of things?

53:10.587 --> 53:14.182
The night Audrey died was
the first time I saw the Boogeyman.

53:14.391 --> 53:16.188
- Sarah...
- I know what you're gonna say.

53:16.393 --> 53:17.883
This is not about the Boogeyman.

53:18.094 --> 53:20.858
Audrey dying the same way
my mom died, I know.

53:21.064 --> 53:23.294
This is about your guilt.

53:24.167 --> 53:25.657
It's always been about the guilt.

53:25.869 --> 53:29.202
You blame yourself for not preventing
your mother's suicide.

53:29.406 --> 53:31.499
You think I blame myself
for Audrey too?

53:31.942 --> 53:35.173
A lot of those guilty feelings
came bubbling back up to the surface.

53:35.679 --> 53:37.271
What do you think?

53:38.715 --> 53:41.343
I wish I'd taken Audrey
more seriously.

53:41.551 --> 53:43.178
By believing in the Boogeyman?

53:43.386 --> 53:45.820
Validating her fear
by making it your own?

53:46.022 --> 53:48.820
Sarah, you're not afraid
of the Boogeyman.

53:49.025 --> 53:52.392
You're afraid of the guilt.
Of what it's capable of.

53:52.596 --> 53:55.463
Guilt that you've never
completely come to terms with.

53:55.832 --> 53:59.461
So I'm going cray
because I'm afraid of going cray?

53:59.669 --> 54:03.127
- That's what you're saying?
- You're not cray.

54:03.807 --> 54:06.674
Either I'm cray
or the Boogeyman is real.

54:06.876 --> 54:09.344
And right now,
I don't know which one is worse.

54:09.546 --> 54:10.638
They're the same fear.

54:11.348 --> 54:13.248
Sarah, once you face it...

54:13.450 --> 54:16.851
...you'll find that neither of those
things will bother you anymore.

54:59.796 --> 55:02.128
This is ridiculous.

55:19.182 --> 55:21.082
Oh, my God.

55:25.455 --> 55:27.685
I don't believe in you.

55:28.124 --> 55:29.591
You don't exist.

55:39.436 --> 55:40.994
I don't believe in you.

55:41.204 --> 55:42.899
You don't exist.

55:44.841 --> 55:46.900
I don't believe in you.

55:47.577 --> 55:49.568
You don't exist.

55:54.851 --> 55:55.943
I don't believe in you.

55:56.753 --> 55:57.913
You don't fucking exist.

56:13.303 --> 56:14.736
Great.

56:15.605 --> 56:18.039
You really are going cray.

57:15.064 --> 57:16.497
Oh, my God.

58:38.314 --> 58:40.043
Jeremy?

58:41.551 --> 58:44.543
Help me. Help me, please.

58:45.288 --> 58:47.779
- Help me.
- Tell me what to do.

58:50.593 --> 58:52.060
Get me out.

58:54.764 --> 58:57.164
I'm gonna go
and I'm gonna find some help.

58:57.367 --> 58:58.732
I'm gonna get you out,
you hear me?

58:58.935 --> 59:00.129
No, don't leave me.

59:03.239 --> 59:04.797
No.

59:08.044 --> 59:10.877
Sarah. Sarah. Are you okay?

59:11.080 --> 59:13.742
Hey. Come here.
Come here. Come here, Sarah.

59:13.950 --> 59:15.440
Are you okay? Come here.

59:15.652 --> 59:16.676
My God, what happened?

59:20.189 --> 59:22.123
How did...? How did I get...?

59:22.325 --> 59:24.350
You were under your bed.
I heard you screaming.

59:24.994 --> 59:26.586
Oh, Jesus, Sarah, you're bleeding.

59:28.164 --> 59:30.758
- That's not my blood.
- What? Whose blood is it?

59:30.967 --> 59:32.992
- That's Jeremy's blood.
- Jeremy? How did...?

59:33.202 --> 59:34.464
That's where he grabbed me.

59:35.171 --> 59:36.160
That means he's real.

59:36.372 --> 59:37.862
David...

59:38.074 --> 59:39.974
...that means
the Boogeyman is real.

59:40.176 --> 59:42.610
No, no, come here.

59:43.112 --> 59:44.136
Come here.

59:48.284 --> 59:50.309
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

59:51.054 --> 59:52.385
See, Sarah?

59:52.589 --> 59:54.250
There's no blood.

59:54.457 --> 59:56.448
It didn't actually happen.

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:03.397
No dead bodies.

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.768
But I saw them.

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:10.166
I recognied their faces.

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:12.773
They're the people
who live in this dorm.

01:00:12.976 --> 01:00:14.307
Yeah, it was the Boogeyman.

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:18.173
I heard it on the radio.
That's why she killed herself.

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:19.908
Do you know what else is weird?

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:21.947
I heard that Jeremy and Lukas
are missing.

01:00:22.151 --> 01:00:24.984
- Did you hear what they said?
- Yeah.

01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:29.318
Listen, everyone on campus
listens to your radio show.

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:32.961
People are bound to start talking.
It doesn't mean a...

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:36.187
Are you okay?

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:39.562
It looked like someone
was up there watching me.

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:45.230
- I don't see anything.
- There was something up there.

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:56.375
- See? They're starting to believe.
- You don't know...

01:00:56.586 --> 01:00:59.453
Which is what happened
to the patients at the Hillridge Clinic.

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:01.886
- They started to believe...
- What happened at Hillridge...

01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:05.288
...won't happen here because
everyone is leaving tomorrow.

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.963
The dorms close tomorrow
at noon, right?

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:11.759
Oh, my God, the suitcases
all over the hallway.

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:14.797
It's gonna happen tomorrow
when everyone's leaving.

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:16.471
Sarah.

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:19.468
I think...

01:01:21.544 --> 01:01:24.809
...maybe you should just spend
winter break with your dad.

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.310
Are you serious?

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:30.308
Yeah.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:34.686
He called earlier and he said
he hadn't talked to you in months.

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:36.655
Why'd you lie to me?

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:40.286
I'm sorry. I was gonna tell him.
I just...

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:44.098
You don't want me
to come home with you?

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.325
I just don't want you to use me
as an excuse.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.561
I mean, you haven't been home...

01:01:49.138 --> 01:01:51.163
...since your mom died.

01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:55.276
Maybe it'd be good for you.

01:01:55.478 --> 01:01:57.446
Good for me?
What does that mean?

01:01:58.214 --> 01:02:00.114
It's disgusting.

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:02.648
Ben, what's up?

01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:05.749
All right, let's go.

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:13.890
I'm just saying it's okay
if you're not completely over it...

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:17.328
...just as long as you're still trying
to deal with it.

01:02:27.977 --> 01:02:30.104
Is that a blueprint
of the women's restroom?

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:32.715
It's true?
You're gonna put a webcam...

01:02:32.915 --> 01:02:34.712
...in the women's restroom
for your fraternity?

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:35.975
That is so sketchy.

01:02:36.185 --> 01:02:38.585
Yeah, well, if I don't,
I stay a pledge next semester.

01:02:38.788 --> 01:02:41.256
Have you any idea
what I've been through?

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:44.949
The humiliation? There is no way
I'm going through that shit again.

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:47.493
Some guy was supposed to do it,
but he never came back.

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:49.995
Probably got caught, fucking idiot.

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:54.801
I will give you 50 bucks
to do it for me.

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:58.735
- I hope you're kidding.
- No. You can walk into the bathroom.

01:02:58.941 --> 01:03:01.501
I have to crawl
through the fucking heating ducts.

01:03:01.744 --> 01:03:03.507
I don't think that's a good idea.

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:05.874
Me either.
That's why you should do it for me.

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:09.415
- No, Ben, I'm serious. I saw...
- What?

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.216
I saw blood
coming out of those vents.

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:16.015
Blood.

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:21.759
Oh, man.

01:03:21.964 --> 01:03:26.298
Is this about the Boogeyman?

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:29.494
Because that's what everyone
in the cafeteria was talking about.

01:03:29.705 --> 01:03:31.605
See? That's what I'm talking about.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:34.572
- Everyone's talking about it because...
- Because it's fucking creepy.

01:03:34.777 --> 01:03:36.711
No, it's completely irrational.

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:48.988
- I'm just trying to help you, Sarah.
- I appreciate your help.

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:50.819
Where are you going?

01:03:51.027 --> 01:03:53.552
Haven't you heard? I'm going cray.

01:03:55.731 --> 01:03:57.255
I feel really shitty.

01:03:59.468 --> 01:04:03.495
<i>The patients are beginning to speak
of a presence in the clinic.</i>

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:07.608
<i>Something they can feel.
Something I can feel.</i>

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:11.678
<i>Something I don't dare admit
I've felt before.</i>

01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:15.917
<i>While I continue to explain away
the Boogeyman's existence...</i>

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:19.485
<i>...as nothing but the darkness
within ourselves...</i>

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.850
<i>...I'm left to wonder:</i>

01:04:22.158 --> 01:04:25.719
<i>Does that make him
anything less than real?</i>

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:11.667
Come on, man, let's find those girls.

01:05:21.984 --> 01:05:24.919
You missed
your Behavioral Genetics final.

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:26.712
Dr. Kane, I'm sorry.

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:29.721
I had something important
I had to take care of.

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:32.520
More important
than passing my class?

01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:41.795
<i>"Sociology of Modern Oral Legends. "</i>

01:05:42.004 --> 01:05:44.063
Thinking about
changing your major?

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:47.572
I found this article
in Dr. Allen's journal.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:50.007
He was trying to find a way
to stop the Boogeyman.

01:05:50.379 --> 01:05:51.778
We've talked about this.

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:54.506
The Boogeyman is not real.
He is a legend.

01:05:54.717 --> 01:05:56.082
According to this article...

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:59.049
...a legend lives or dies
based on its social relevancy.

01:05:59.255 --> 01:06:01.086
A legend is a fictional story, Sarah.

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.884
Not a living, breathing entity.
You do realie that?

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:09.597
Sarah, indulge me.

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:13.997
Why do we create legends,
from a psychological point of view?

01:06:14.203 --> 01:06:16.501
We create legends as parables.

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:20.938
Stories to help us understand
the world we live in.

01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:33.513
All right.

01:06:33.723 --> 01:06:34.985
Okay.

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:39.958
This is the most fun I've had
in years.

01:06:40.463 --> 01:06:42.931
So, what does that say
about the Boogeyman?

01:06:43.265 --> 01:06:47.759
It says we're trying to define evil
by giving it a face and a name.

01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:50.234
Yes. And as long as there is evil
in this world...

01:06:50.439 --> 01:06:52.430
...the Boogeyman remains
socially relevant.

01:06:52.641 --> 01:06:54.108
- That's all it's saying.
- No.

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:56.244
It's saying
that the legend survives...

01:06:56.445 --> 01:06:59.778
...because the person
retelling the story believes it.

01:06:59.982 --> 01:07:02.644
But you're taking that
completely out of context.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:05.116
Don't you see?
The Hillridge Clinic murders...

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:06.618
...they make the legend real.

01:07:08.057 --> 01:07:11.925
<i>It's as if the legend
has a life of its own.</i>

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:17.792
Oh, yeah.

01:07:20.936 --> 01:07:23.962
Oh, hello, baby.

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:25.800
Oh, what do you want?

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:28.442
Yeah, that's right.

01:07:32.681 --> 01:07:35.775
Let me introduce you...

01:07:36.585 --> 01:07:39.315
...to my one-eyed friend.

01:07:43.426 --> 01:07:45.360
Did you hear anything?

01:07:54.537 --> 01:07:56.869
Up there.
You guys, you guys, this is creepy.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:59.371
What was that? What was that?

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:03.678
There was an incident last year.
A man named Tim Jensen...

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:05.676
...blamed his murders
on the Boogeyman.

01:08:05.881 --> 01:08:09.612
- What does that have to do with this?
- Both stories are different variations...

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:10.808
...of the same legend.

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.181
Usually, when a person
retells the legend...

01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:16.290
...they change it to fit society's needs.
But in this case...

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:18.653
Wait, wait, wait.
Listen to what you're saying.

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:22.697
- A legend cannot modify itself.
- This one can.

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:25.389
To some people,
the Boogeyman is Tim Jensen.

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:27.997
To other people, it's Henry Porter.

01:08:28.203 --> 01:08:30.764
But it's the original legend
that gains its strength...

01:08:30.973 --> 01:08:33.167
...every time it's reborn.

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:37.410
So you missed my final...

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:41.810
...because you were trying to stop
a legend from perpetuating itself.

01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:44.877
You understand
why that worries me?

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.749
I'm running out of time.

01:08:47.423 --> 01:08:49.152
Wait a minute, Sarah.

01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:50.848
Sarah?

01:08:59.568 --> 01:09:00.728
What the...?

01:09:04.607 --> 01:09:05.665
Blood.

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:27.019
Oh, fuck.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:56.021
What are you saying?
Every time someone buys this crap...

01:09:56.225 --> 01:09:59.888
...the Boogeyman gets stronger?
- It keeps the legend alive.

01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:01.619
It keeps him alive.

01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:05.960
David, it's about to happen here.
In this dorm.

01:10:06.168 --> 01:10:07.795
The legend is about to be reborn.

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:13.206
- What did I miss?
- Did you talk to Jeremy or Lukas?

01:10:13.409 --> 01:10:15.001
No. And I've looked everywhere.

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:18.647
- See? It's happening.
- Well, Jeremy did have finals all day.

01:10:18.847 --> 01:10:21.077
They probably went out
to celebrate after.

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:22.773
Without calling you?

01:10:22.985 --> 01:10:25.385
I'm not saying
he won't be punished.

01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:30.389
I just... I don't think he was killed
by some mythological creature.

01:10:30.593 --> 01:10:31.582
Come on, Lindsay.

01:10:31.927 --> 01:10:34.657
What was the longest Jeremy's
ever gone without calling you?

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:36.023
An hour?

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:39.623
Sarah...

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:42.395
...you're my best friend
and I love you...

01:10:42.605 --> 01:10:44.129
...but if you honestly think...

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:46.865
...that everyone in our dorm
is gonna die...

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.805
...why aren't you leaving?

01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:50.842
Because I can't do that.

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:54.607
I can't just walk away
and let everyone...

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:57.684
- I have to get them out of here.
- Sarah, this is ridiculous.

01:10:57.886 --> 01:11:01.447
You're not going to convince an
entire dorm full of people to just leave.

01:11:01.657 --> 01:11:03.750
<i>This is DJ Def Jeff...</i>

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:08.555
<i>...and you're listening
to WZXB radio.</i>

01:11:08.897 --> 01:11:11.491
I'll be with you all night long...

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.930
...keeping the energy alive...

01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:16.161
...so all those can stay awake.

01:11:17.406 --> 01:11:19.135
<i>Listen to this.</i>

01:11:26.815 --> 01:11:28.578
What the hell...?

01:11:29.785 --> 01:11:32.185
Hi. You're not even supposed
to be here tonight.

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:34.015
What are you doing?

01:11:36.191 --> 01:11:37.180
Attention.

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:39.691
All students living
in Hammonds Hall...

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:43.725
<i>...this is Sarah Morris
with an emergency announcement.</i>

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:45.661
Shit.

01:11:45.868 --> 01:11:48.803
Campus security has issued
an emergency request...

01:11:49.004 --> 01:11:50.767
...for all students to evacuate...

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:53.134
<i>...Hammonds Hall immediately.</i>

01:11:53.342 --> 01:11:55.867
<i>Take your belongings
and stay with a friend.</i>

01:11:56.078 --> 01:11:58.603
<i>Anyone not in Hammonds Hall.</i>

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:06.616
<i>I repeat. This is an emergency
announcement...</i>

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:10.280
...for students of Hammonds Hall
to evacuate immediately.

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:12.790
Take your belongings with you.

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:22.765
Several students
are already missing.

01:12:22.971 --> 01:12:26.771
- It's dangerous for anyone to remain...
- You're listening to WZXB Radio.

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:31.309
Up next, DJ Def Jeff
and the smooth grooves.

01:12:32.081 --> 01:12:35.676
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm calling campus security.

01:12:35.884 --> 01:12:37.818
They haven't made
any announcement.

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:01.770
Sarah Morris?

01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:05.174
- Are you Sarah Morris?
- Yes, but listen to me.

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:06.575
- I can explain.
- I'm sure.

01:13:06.782 --> 01:13:09.478
Please. There is a journal in my room,
that will... David.

01:13:09.852 --> 01:13:12.343
- Hey, back off.
- Just tell me where you're taking her.

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:14.613
Go back to your dorm,
she'll call you when she's done.

01:13:14.823 --> 01:13:18.122
- Don't go back to the dorm. Promise.
- Get in the car.

01:13:18.327 --> 01:13:20.022
Back off.

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:25.200
Please, David. David, don't go back.

01:13:27.736 --> 01:13:29.135
David.

01:13:37.846 --> 01:13:41.111
Hey, David. Is Sarah with you?

01:13:41.316 --> 01:13:43.011
<i>No, they took her
to the security office.</i>

01:13:43.652 --> 01:13:46.086
Security office? Why?

01:13:46.288 --> 01:13:48.381
<i>- Long story.
- Is she okay?</i>

01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:50.856
<i>Yeah, but they won't let me
see her.</i>

01:13:51.059 --> 01:13:52.458
<i>Did you hear from Jeremy?</i>

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:56.859
No, I still haven't heard
from Jeremy or Lukas.

01:14:00.536 --> 01:14:04.302
<i>- I'm starting to wonder if...
- What?</i>

01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:09.137
Maybe Sarah was right.

01:14:09.578 --> 01:14:12.172
Yeah, I'm packing up my stuff
and getting out of here.

01:14:12.681 --> 01:14:15.980
<i>- Try not to worry.
- Okay. Well, just keep me posted.</i>

01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:18.444
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:57.358
Help!

01:14:58.293 --> 01:15:00.090
Somebody help me!

01:15:00.963 --> 01:15:03.363
Help!

01:15:20.382 --> 01:15:21.713
Help!

01:15:32.628 --> 01:15:35.324
Help! Help!

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:39.933
Help! Help!

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:50.905
Oh, come on.
Is this totally necessary?

01:15:51.113 --> 01:15:54.913
I mean, it's a little bit extreme keeping
her locked in a cell on her own.

01:15:55.117 --> 01:15:58.553
She's claiming everyone in her dorm
is going to die.

01:15:58.754 --> 01:16:00.551
Dr. Kane.

01:16:02.424 --> 01:16:03.789
All right.

01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:10.659
- What are you doing here?
- Sarah.

01:16:10.866 --> 01:16:13.926
You have half the student body
in a total panic for nothing.

01:16:14.136 --> 01:16:15.603
My friends are dead.

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:18.532
I saw them.
There was blood all over the hallway.

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.367
- And then...
- Sarah.

01:16:23.045 --> 01:16:25.536
You're relapsing to the time
of your mother's death.

01:16:26.214 --> 01:16:27.977
You have to let go.

01:16:28.183 --> 01:16:31.380
- Sarah, it is not your fault.
- I know it's not my fault.

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:34.787
This has nothing to do
with how my mother died.

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:36.249
Please.

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:40.588
I just... I know something horrible
is gonna happen.

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:43.390
Why hasn't anyone else
seen this blood?

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:46.462
Because it is in your head.

01:17:34.983 --> 01:17:37.816
<i>- Campus security.
- I just found some girl's body.</i>

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:40.250
<i>She's inside the...
God, there's blood everywhere.</i>

01:17:40.455 --> 01:17:41.683
Hey, calm down.

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:44.222
Where are you calling from?

01:17:44.826 --> 01:17:47.852
<i>I'm in the laundry room
in Hammonds Hall.</i>

01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:49.223
Okay, stay where you are.

01:17:49.431 --> 01:17:52.525
I'm gonna call the police and I'm
on my way over there right now.

01:17:54.836 --> 01:17:57.669
A student's body's been found
in Hammonds Hall.

01:17:57.873 --> 01:18:00.103
I gotta go. Come on.

01:18:00.308 --> 01:18:03.004
No, it's okay. I'll take care of her.

01:18:03.478 --> 01:18:04.809
All right.

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.741
See? I was telling you the truth.

01:18:06.948 --> 01:18:08.882
- It's him.
- That's not what this means.

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:12.019
You can't honestly believe
that this was a coincidence.

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:13.278
Please.

01:18:13.488 --> 01:18:18.084
If we don't do something they're gonna
find more bodies in that dorm. Just...

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:20.693
You have to believe me.

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:31.038
Oh, my God. You do believe me.

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:35.402
That is not what you think it is.

01:18:36.445 --> 01:18:37.707
No.

01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:42.778
Wait, Dr. Kane. Don't go in there.

01:18:48.623 --> 01:18:51.683
See?
Absolutely nothing to worry about.

01:18:53.628 --> 01:18:55.357
Dr. Kane.

01:18:58.633 --> 01:19:01.864
Sarah, get the keys. Get the keys.

01:19:03.205 --> 01:19:04.467
There. On the desk, Sarah.

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:08.341
Oh, my God.

01:19:14.216 --> 01:19:15.205
Okay.

01:19:16.118 --> 01:19:17.642
Oh, God.

01:19:18.153 --> 01:19:20.951
- I don't know which one it is.
- Try them one at a time.

01:19:21.156 --> 01:19:22.487
Hurry.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.554
- Oh, my God.
- For God's sake, Sarah, hurry.

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:29.128
Oh, my God.

01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:32.060
Kane!

01:19:41.409 --> 01:19:42.637
No.

01:19:55.657 --> 01:19:57.557
I'm sorry.

01:19:57.959 --> 01:19:59.893
I didn't mean for you...

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:03.661
He used me.

01:20:14.876 --> 01:20:16.104
<i>- Sarah.
- David.</i>

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:18.802
<i>David, I figured it out.
It's all my fault.</i>

01:20:19.014 --> 01:20:21.278
Sarah, slow down. Where are you?

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:24.712
He wanted me to see Audrey die.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:27.388
He wanted me to tell people about it.
He used me.

01:20:27.589 --> 01:20:30.649
<i>He used me to convince everyone
he was real.</i>

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:32.349
Sarah, you were right.

01:20:32.561 --> 01:20:34.825
You were right.
I'm so sorry I didn't believe you.

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:37.362
Tell me where to take the journal
and I'll be right there.

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:38.992
Wait, where are you?

01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:41.101
<i>- I'm in your room.
- You're still in the dorm.</i>

01:20:41.303 --> 01:20:44.136
<i>David, you have to get out of there.
David.</i>

01:20:44.439 --> 01:20:45.736
David.

01:20:47.475 --> 01:20:49.443
David, you have to get out
of the dorm now.

01:20:50.378 --> 01:20:53.472
David. David. David...

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:12.896
Go around back.

01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:15.692
You heard him. Go around back.

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:22.299
I'm not kidding, there was someone
hiding under my bed.

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:24.569
I swear to God there was.

01:21:28.583 --> 01:21:29.572
Oh, David.

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.810
David, what's wrong?

01:21:34.022 --> 01:21:36.582
David, please talk to me.

01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:40.454
David, come on, let's go.
Let's just get out of here.

01:21:42.364 --> 01:21:43.922
You were right.

01:21:44.966 --> 01:21:47.093
The Boogeyman is real.

01:21:58.613 --> 01:21:59.602
No!

01:22:01.549 --> 01:22:03.176
- Sarah, help me.
- No!

01:22:03.385 --> 01:22:06.183
- You son of a bitch!
- Please. Don't let go. Don't let go.

01:22:08.223 --> 01:22:11.056
- No.
- No.

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.685
No!

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:19.263
No!

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:21.094
David.

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:23.833
Let him go.

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:35.549
No!

01:22:48.997 --> 01:22:50.828
Oh, my God.

01:23:15.757 --> 01:23:17.816
Sarah, what's going on?

01:23:29.404 --> 01:23:30.928
What the hell happened here?

01:23:33.141 --> 01:23:35.735
Sarah, tell them.
Tell them about the Boogeyman.

01:23:35.944 --> 01:23:37.639
He's real, isn't he?

01:23:43.785 --> 01:23:44.774
Oh, my.

01:23:47.822 --> 01:23:49.517
It was me.

01:23:49.924 --> 01:23:51.949
- I killed him.
- No.

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:53.286
I killed all of them.

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:55.588
There's no such thing
as the Boogeyman.

01:23:55.797 --> 01:23:57.321
It was me.

01:24:00.869 --> 01:24:02.393
Start evacuating the building.

01:24:03.571 --> 01:24:05.061
Come on.
Everybody out of here.

01:24:05.273 --> 01:24:07.002
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

01:24:07.809 --> 01:24:09.777
Put your hands behind your back.

01:24:20.021 --> 01:24:22.080
- Cut the string.
- Let's go.

01:25:33.728 --> 01:25:35.423
So how'd you do it?

01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:38.531
How'd you get your boyfriend
into all those pieces?

01:25:41.035 --> 01:25:44.596
You don't expect us to believe
you actually ripped him apart, do you?

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:48.572
It was me. I did it.

01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:54.871
Okay.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.968
We have to get out of here.

01:26:15.403 --> 01:26:16.734
This is Officer Young.

01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:19.964
The elevator seems to be stuck
between the first and second floors.

01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:22.643
Requesting immediate assistance.

01:26:23.311 --> 01:26:25.438
<i>Say again, Officer Young.
You're breaking up.</i>

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:31.478
We have to get out of here
right now.

01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:33.381
Just calm down.
They'll get us in a second.

01:26:33.588 --> 01:26:35.647
This is Officer Young
requesting assistance.

01:26:35.857 --> 01:26:39.452
The elevator is stuck between the first
and the second floors. We need...

01:27:06.454 --> 01:27:08.513
This is DJ Def Jeff...

01:27:08.723 --> 01:27:14.389
...the voice of Woodbridge
University's radio WZXB.

01:27:14.596 --> 01:27:16.962
I hope all of you
freshman listeners...

01:27:17.165 --> 01:27:20.191
...managed to survive
the first week of classes.

01:27:20.401 --> 01:27:22.096
Here we go.

01:27:24.739 --> 01:27:27.503
Campus radio sucks.

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:31.474
Jennifer, did you hear me?

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:36.516
I'm trying to study.

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:39.016
Nobody studies
the first week of classes.

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:40.983
You're cray.

01:27:42.323 --> 01:27:45.087
So was the last girl who lived here.

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:47.992
What are you talking about?

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:49.886
That girl.

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:53.226
The one who thought
the Boogeyman was killing everyone.

01:27:53.835 --> 01:27:56.065
The RA told me this was her room.

01:27:56.504 --> 01:27:59.871
- You're so full of shit.
- I'm serious.

01:28:00.441 --> 01:28:02.932
It all happened in our building.

01:28:03.144 --> 01:28:04.805
Seriously?

01:28:05.313 --> 01:28:07.042
They just changed the name...

01:28:07.248 --> 01:28:09.842
...so no one would be scared
to live here.

01:28:11.386 --> 01:28:13.911
After all, who wants to live
in a building...

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:17.387
...where they found bodies
in the heating vents?

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:32.034
What's wrong, are you scared?

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:33.864
I'm annoyed.

01:28:36.544 --> 01:28:38.705
I'm going to the library.

01:28:39.881 --> 01:28:41.781
Where it's quiet.

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:45.247
Come on, I was just kidding around.
I'll be quiet.

01:28:47.388 --> 01:28:49.413
I will see you in the morning.

01:28:50.358 --> 01:28:52.588
Seriously, I'll be quiet.

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:57.628
You don't wanna be in here alone,
do you?

01:28:58.366 --> 01:28:59.628
Don't be ridiculous.

01:29:06.207 --> 01:29:07.731
Hey, Amy.

01:29:07.942 --> 01:29:10.103
Don't let the Boogeyman get you.

01:29:17.618 --> 01:29:19.279
Whatever.

01:29:38.406 --> 01:29:40.601
Changed your mind, huh?

01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:44.039
Too scared to walk
to the library alone?

01:30:20.448 --> 01:30:23.315
Jennifer, you're hilarious.

01:30:24.752 --> 01:30:26.049
Wait.

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:28.347
It's not Jennifer.

01:30:28.756 --> 01:30:30.656
Who could it be?

01:30:32.093 --> 01:30:33.287
No.

01:30:33.494 --> 01:30:36.395
Is it the Boogeyman?

01:30:41.402 --> 01:30:44.735
All right, I admit it.
I was scared, okay?

01:30:45.305 --> 01:30:51.321
