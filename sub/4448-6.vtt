09:11.801 --> 09:12.969
‐ DUDE.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.304
‐ NOW REMEMBER, MIKE,
IN BELLO'S WORLD,

09:14.387 --> 09:17.015
VOUCHING FOR SOMEBODY
CARRIES CONSEQUENCES,

09:17.098 --> 09:19.809
LIFE OR DEATH CONSEQUENCES,
YOU KNOW.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.478
‐ LIKE YOU VOUCHED FOR ME.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.021
I LEARNED FROM THE BEST.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.856
‐ HMM.

09:31.863 --> 09:32.989
‐ THIS IS A GOOD READ.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.575
LIKE A ROBERT LUDLUM NOVEL.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.744
THE WARREN ENTANGLEMENT.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.037
YOU FIND THE TORPEDO,

09:39.120 --> 09:40.997
GIVE BRIGGS TIME ALONE
WITH THE DRUGS,

09:40.997 --> 09:42.290
AND THEN CATCH HIM
IN THE ACT.

09:42.373 --> 09:44.375
‐ YEAH.

09:44.459 --> 09:46.086
I HAND HIM THE HEROIN
ON A SILVER PLATTER,

09:46.169 --> 09:48.254
AND YOU MAY GET
HIS HEAD IN RETURN.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.964
‐ WELL, REMIND ME
NEVER TO MESS WITH YOU.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.591
YOU'D MAKE A HELL
OF A BAD GUY.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.093
‐ CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

09:53.176 --> 09:57.013
WHAT IF WE'RE WRONG
ABOUT BRIGGS?

09:57.097 --> 10:01.684
‐ BELLO, BRIGGS,
THESE ARE DANGEROUS MEN.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.145
THEY WANT YOU
TO DOUBT YOUR INSTINCTS.

10:04.229 --> 10:06.106
I WANT YOU TO TRUST THEM.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.733
YOU DO THAT,
YOU CATCH THEM BOTH.

10:08.817 --> 10:09.984
‐ THEN WHAT?

10:09.984 --> 10:12.112
‐ I DON'T KNOW,

10:12.195 --> 10:15.698
YOU MAKE DEPUTY DIRECTOR
AT 35 INSTEAD OF 40.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.618
‐ DOES IT GET ME
BACK TO D. C.?

10:18.701 --> 10:21.037
‐ THIS IS A MARATHON, MIKE,
NOT A SPRINT.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.748
ALL RIGHT, IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW
FAST YOU GET BACK TO WASHINGTON.

10:23.832 --> 10:27.919
IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE
YOU GET BACK THERE IN ONE PIECE.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.088
‐ THANKS.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.805
[distant sirens]

10:47.021 --> 10:49.858
‐ [retches]

11:35.528 --> 11:37.822
[cell phone rings]

11:42.493 --> 11:46.164
[ringing continues]

11:50.084 --> 11:51.502
HELLO.

11:51.586 --> 11:52.962
‐ CHUCKIE, BRIGGS TOLD ME

11:53.046 --> 11:54.005
YOU HAD TO RUSH
OUT OF QUINN'S.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.382
HOW YOU DOING?
‐ YOU KNOW.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.218
‐ STILL THINKING
ABOUT WHISTLER, HUH?

11:58.301 --> 12:00.053
‐ YEAH, MAN,
THAT ROCKED ME.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.263
‐ YEAH, I HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU SINCE.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.974
WHERE ARE YOU?

12:04.974 --> 12:06.684
‐ FONTANA.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.978
‐ FONTUCKY?
NICE.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.981
AT LEAST I KNOW YOU'RE
RELAXING OUT THERE.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.942
‐ NOBODY RELAXES
IN FONTANA.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.360
I'M ACTUALLY ON A CASE.

12:15.443 --> 12:19.239
I THOUGHT IT'D BE BEST TO,
YOU KNOW, STAY BUSY.

12:19.322 --> 12:21.491
‐ YEAH, YOU DON'T SOUND
TOO GOOD, MAMA.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.409
‐ I'M FINE, JOHNNY.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.036
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?

12:25.119 --> 12:28.998
‐ OH, YOU KNOW,
USUAL ASS COVERING.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.500
SO CHECK IT OUT,

12:30.583 --> 12:32.043
LOOKS LIKE THE BOSS
TOLD THE HIGHER‐UPS

12:32.126 --> 12:34.003
THAT WE WERE GONNA
GET ODIN ON THIS ONE

12:34.087 --> 12:35.588
AND THAT WE LEFT HIM
WITH HIS DICK IN HIS HAND

12:35.672 --> 12:36.965
WHEN THE BUST FELL THROUGH.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.007
‐ YEAH, BUT BRIGGS WENT IN

12:38.007 --> 12:39.550
AND EXPLAINED
THE WHOLE THING, RIGHT?

12:39.634 --> 12:42.095
‐ HE DID, BUT CALDWELL MUST
THINK HE'S COVERING FOR US

12:42.178 --> 12:43.388
BECAUSE HE WANTS YOU AND ME

12:43.471 --> 12:46.182
TO COME IN
AND GIVE OUR SIDE OF IT.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.350
‐ WHEN?

12:47.433 --> 12:50.103
‐ ASAP.
TOMORROW, 9:00 A. M.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.983
‐ UM...YEAH, I DON'T‐‐

12:55.066 --> 12:56.526
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
IF THAT'S POSSIBLE.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.945
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN‐‐
IF I CAN GET OUT OF HERE.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.114
‐ YEAH, HE WASN'T ASKING.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.573
‐ JESUS.

13:02.657 --> 13:03.950
‐ BEST NOT GIVE HIM
ANOTHER REASON

13:04.033 --> 13:07.120
TO CRAWL UP OUR ASSES,
YOU KNOW?

13:07.203 --> 13:08.913
‐ I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING, ALL RIGHT?

13:08.997 --> 13:10.665
‐ BE GOOD.
‐ ALL RIGHT.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.807
‐ FLYING SOLO, MR. PILOT?

13:27.890 --> 13:29.809
‐ JUST WAITING FOR A GIRL.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.102
‐ A GIRL?
‐ MM‐HMM.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.061
‐ NOT A WOMAN?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.187
‐ NO, YOU'RE RIGHT,
A WOMAN.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.689
DEFINITELY A WOMAN.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.190
‐ WHAT'S SHE LOOK LIKE?

13:36.274 --> 13:38.693
MAYBE I COULD
HELP YOU FIND HER.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.987
‐ OH, NO, I THINK I'D KNOW
IF SHE WAS HERE.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.572
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.283
SHE'S GOT THESE BIG BROWN EYES
AND LONG BROWN HAIR.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.909
AND SHE'S GOT
THIS WAY ABOUT HER.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.328
SHE JUST ALWAYS MAKES ME
FEEL GOOD.

13:49.412 --> 13:50.955
‐ I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
‐ YEAH.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.331
IT'S LIKE, NO MATTER HOW BAD
A DAY I'M HAVING,

13:52.415 --> 13:55.918
SHE JUST MAKES
EVERYTHING BETTER.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.962
‐ IF THIS GIRL'S
HALF AS GOOD AS SHE SOUNDS,

13:58.046 --> 14:00.673
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN COMPETE.

14:00.757 --> 14:04.343
MAYBE I SHOULD GET YOU OUT
OF HERE BEFORE SHE SHOWS UP.

14:04.427 --> 14:07.013
HOW FAR IS THAT
BEACHFRONT MANSION OF YOURS?

14:07.013 --> 14:08.514
‐ WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR PLACE?

14:08.598 --> 14:10.767
‐ YOURS IS CLOSER.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.603
‐ WELL, MY ROOMMATES
ARE A BIT UNTIDY.

14:13.686 --> 14:14.979
‐ OOH.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.023
THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY PILOTS
THAT GOT SHOT DOWN.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.357
‐ IT'S NOT LIKE THAT,
ALL RIGHT?

14:18.441 --> 14:19.984
‐ COME ON, ARE YOU
KEEPING THEM FROM ME,

14:20.068 --> 14:21.486
OR ARE YOU KEEPING ME
FROM THEM?

14:21.569 --> 14:22.737
‐ OF COURSE NOT, ALL RIGHT?

14:22.820 --> 14:24.113
‐ GOOD, THEN LET'S HANG OUT.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.990
AT LEAST WITH PAIGE.

14:26.074 --> 14:29.243
I OWE HER
A THANK YOU FOR SOMETHING.

14:29.327 --> 14:30.411
‐ OKAY.

14:30.495 --> 14:33.081
‐ THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.005
[distant sirens]

14:41.005 --> 14:42.423
‐ BRIGGS, HAND ME MY CLOTHES.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.050
‐ FINE.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.218
I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU SHOW UP AT THAT MEETING,

14:45.301 --> 14:46.302
HE'S GONNA FIGURE IT OUT.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.637
‐ I HAVE NO CHOICE.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.013
‐ YEAH, ACTUALLY
YOU COULD CALL IN SICK.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.431
‐ CALDWELL'S
A FREAKING BLOODHOUND.

14:50.515 --> 14:51.641
HE'LL FIND ME.

14:51.724 --> 14:52.725
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
WHEN YOU MISSED

14:52.809 --> 14:53.976
THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT
SEMINAR?

14:53.976 --> 14:55.812
‐ HE TRACKED ME DOWN
AT A GODDAMN STRIP CLUB.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.313
‐ I MEAN,
EVEN IF I DITCH HIM,

14:57.396 --> 15:01.109
THE BUREAU WILL BE AT MY DOOR
GIVING ME A RANDOM DRUG TEST.

15:01.192 --> 15:03.319
I'M SCREWED, AREN'T I?

15:03.402 --> 15:04.612
AM I SCREWED?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.241
‐ YEAH.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.659
‐ WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

15:09.742 --> 15:11.702
I CAN'T LOSE MY JOB.
YOU GOTTA HELP ME.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.454
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING
THAT WE CAN DO.

15:13.538 --> 15:16.457
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.960
‐ NAH.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.587
‐ YEAH.
THERE IS SOMETHING.

15:21.671 --> 15:24.507
TELL ME.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.634
I'M GOING EITHER WAY.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.066
‐ HAIR OF THE DOG.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.026
‐ YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE MORE OF THAT SHIT?

15:44.026 --> 15:46.821
ARE YOU CRAZY?
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

15:46.904 --> 15:48.114
‐ MY C.I. KEEPS A STASH.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.074
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO,
CHARLIE, BUST HIM AGAIN?

15:50.158 --> 15:52.243
‐ YOU WANT ME
TO GO IN THERE HIGH?

15:52.326 --> 15:54.078
YOU'RE CRAZY.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.580
‐ I'M NOT SAYING
GO IN THERE HIGH,

15:55.663 --> 15:57.039
BUT I COULD GIVE YOU
JUST ENOUGH

15:57.039 --> 16:01.252
SO THAT YOU CAN MAYBE
PASS FOR NORMAL.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.921
‐ GOD, THIS IS MESSED UP.

16:04.005 --> 16:06.048
‐ LOOK, CHARLIE,
100 MILLIGRAMS

16:06.132 --> 16:09.051
IS NOT GONNA TURN YOU
INTO A SKAG HAG, ALL RIGHT?

16:09.135 --> 16:10.303
IT'LL GET YOU THROUGH THIS,

16:10.386 --> 16:13.055
AND THEN WE CAN GET THE JUNK
OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM.

16:13.139 --> 16:17.476
‐ YOU KNOW WHAT'S SCARING ME
IS THAT I, UH‐‐

16:17.560 --> 16:19.061
I ACTUALLY WANT IT.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.230
‐ YEAH.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.360
ALL RIGHT.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.622
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.582
‐ GIVE ME THE DAMN NEEDLE.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.505
I CAN'T.

16:46.589 --> 16:50.051
‐ EASY WITH IT.
GOOD.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.178
THERE YOU GO.

17:05.399 --> 17:07.652
WELCOME BACK.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.793
‐ WHAT?

17:23.876 --> 17:25.211
YOU'VE BEEN STARING AT ME
LIKE MY MOTHER

17:25.294 --> 17:26.671
EVER SINCE WE LEFT
THE HOUSE, WHAT?

17:26.754 --> 17:29.006
‐ IS THAT REALLY
HOW A NAVY SEAL WOULD DRESS?

17:29.090 --> 17:30.925
‐ SHUT UP, MAN.

17:31.008 --> 17:32.093
YOU EXPECT ME
TO COME OUT OF THE HOUSE

17:32.176 --> 17:33.469
WEARING A FREAKING WETSUIT
AND A REBREATHER?

17:33.553 --> 17:34.637
‐ LISTEN, MAN,
I'M JUST SAYING.

17:34.720 --> 17:39.141
‐ THAT'S MY CHOICE, MAN.
‐ OKAY.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.309
‐ WHAT?

17:40.393 --> 17:43.854
‐ WE'RE GOOD.

17:43.938 --> 17:45.565
HEY, MAN, WHY'D YOU WANT
TO JOIN THE NAVY?

17:45.648 --> 17:46.983
‐ MY UNCLE ENRIQUE.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.818
TOLD ME I COULD SEE THE WORLD.

17:48.901 --> 17:49.986
WHAT HE DIDN'T TELL ME

17:49.986 --> 17:51.696
WAS THAT I'D SPEND
SIX MONTHS A POP

17:51.779 --> 17:54.115
ON A BOAT
WITH A BUNCH OF DUDES.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.117
WHEN I TOLD MY C. O.
I WAS GETTING CABIN FEVER,

17:56.200 --> 17:59.120
HE SAID,
"COOL, PACK YOUR SEABAG.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.746
WE'RE SHIPPING YOU
OFF TO IRAQ."

18:00.830 --> 18:01.914
‐ I DIDN'T KNOW
THEY COULD DO THAT.

18:01.998 --> 18:03.165
‐ YEAH.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.209
YOU KNOW, NATURALLY THEY GAVE US
ALL THE GRUNT WORK.

18:05.293 --> 18:06.460
I SPENT TWO YEARS
OF MY LIFE

18:06.544 --> 18:08.462
BLOWING UP HAJJI ORDNANCE
AND IEDs.

18:08.546 --> 18:09.672
‐ WHAT,
LIKE <i>HURT LOCKER</i> STUFF?

18:09.755 --> 18:11.007
‐ NEVER SAW IT.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.675
I DON'T WANT
TO RELIVE THAT SHIT, BRO.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.052
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO WATCH
THE PORNO VERSION OF THAT.

18:15.136 --> 18:17.054
FIGURED I'D JOIN
THE NAVY SEALS.

18:17.138 --> 18:18.639
AND WHEN THAT DIDN'T
WORK OUT I SAID,

18:18.723 --> 18:20.891
"SCREW IT, I ALREADY
GOT MY CITIZENSHIP."

18:20.975 --> 18:23.227
‐ WAIT, JOHN,
YOU WEREN'T AN AMERICAN?

18:23.311 --> 18:25.396
‐ WAIT, TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE
AGAINST HARDWORKING IMMIGRANTS

18:25.479 --> 18:27.607
WHO COME HERE FOR A PIECE
OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.191
ME, BELLO.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.611
‐ LOOK, I RESPECT YOU
AND BELLO WITH EQUAL MEASURE.

18:31.694 --> 18:32.987
‐ HMM.
[chuckles]

18:40.953 --> 18:42.455
‐ HE'S COOL.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.999
SIR, THIS IS JOHNNY SERRANO.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.257
‐ WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT HE'S THE RIGHT GUY?

18:53.341 --> 18:54.675
‐ JOHNNY'S AN EX‐NAVY SEAL.

18:54.759 --> 18:56.010
‐ WHY NO LONGER?

18:56.093 --> 19:00.097
‐ I SERVED MY COUNTRY HONORABLY
FOR 32,400 BUCKS A YEAR.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.016
SERVING MYSELF
IS A LOT MORE LUCRATIVE.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.477
‐ REMINDS ME
OF SOMEONE I KNOW.

19:04.560 --> 19:08.022
‐ JOHNNY AND I HAVE BEEN BUDDIES
NOW FOR FIVE, SIX YEARS.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.524
‐ YOU ARE DIFFERENT
BRANCHES OF THE MILITARY.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.610
‐ DRINKING BUDDIES,
HE MEANS.

19:12.693 --> 19:13.944
‐ YEAH.
‐ YEAH.

19:14.028 --> 19:16.113
‐ SO YOU WERE STATIONED
IN SAN DIEGO TOO?

19:16.197 --> 19:17.990
‐ THAT'S CLASSIFIED.

19:17.990 --> 19:21.243
‐ HAVE YOU EVER CONDUCTED
A RECOVERY OPERATION?

19:21.327 --> 19:24.455
‐ YOU REMEMBER WHEN THEY DUMPED
BIN LADEN'S BODY AT SEA?

19:24.538 --> 19:26.040
‐ MM.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.416
‐ LET'S JUST SAY IT USED
TO BE ON THE OCEAN FLOOR.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.959
‐ REALLY?

19:29.043 --> 19:31.045
‐ HELL, NO,
IT'S CLASSIFIED.

19:31.128 --> 19:34.215
LOOK, MAN,
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

19:34.298 --> 19:36.217
THIS IS JUST
ONE MORE CLASSIFIED MISSION.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.719
BUT IF YOU WANT MY HELP,
I'M GONNA NEED SOME DETAILS.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.388
‐ IT'S CLASSIFIED.

19:40.471 --> 19:42.723
‐ THAT'S FUNNY,
THAT'S FUNNY.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.354
SORRY, MAN, I'M NOT RISKING
MY LIFE FOR THIS.

19:48.437 --> 19:49.772
OCEAN'S TOO UNFORGIVING.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.774
‐ SO AM I.

19:51.857 --> 19:55.069
‐ YOU THINK I HAVEN'T SEEN
WORSE THAN YOU, BRO?

19:55.152 --> 19:59.824
‐ WE ARE LOOKING FOR
A THREE‐METER TORPEDO CANISTER.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.996
IT WEIGHS AT LEAST
A HUNDRED KILOS.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.081
‐ WHERE IS IT?

20:07.164 --> 20:09.667
‐ I DON'T KNOW.
THAT'S WHY I NEED YOU.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.504
‐ WHO ELSE
IS LOOKING FOR IT?

20:13.587 --> 20:15.047
‐ A FEW OTHER PEOPLE.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.966
THEY HAVE
A TRANSPONDER FREQUENCY.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.342
WE DON'T.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.094
‐ ALL RIGHT, SO I'M GONNA
ASSUME IT'S VALUABLE,

20:20.177 --> 20:21.971
SO I'M GONNA ASSUME
THEY'RE DANGEROUS,

20:22.054 --> 20:24.223
WHICH JACKS UP
MY FINDER'S FEE TO 10%.

20:24.306 --> 20:29.270
‐ I'LL GIVE YOU
A FLAT FEE OF 15,000.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.855
‐ SOUNDS LIKE A DEAL.
‐ 20,000.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.234
‐ DONE.

20:35.317 --> 20:39.155
WE BELIEVE IT WAS JETTISONED
OFF OF LONG BEACH.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.364
‐ OKAY.

20:40.448 --> 20:43.868
THIS IS SAN PEDRO BAY, YEAH?

20:43.951 --> 20:45.995
EIGHT BALL IS YOUR TORPEDO.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.455
I BET THAT'S
APPROPRIATE, RIGHT?

20:47.538 --> 20:50.124
CUE BALL, MY BOAT.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.625
NOW WE CAN FORGET ABOUT
USING THE TRANSPONDER

20:51.709 --> 20:52.710
BECAUSE IT'S SCRAMBLED.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.670
‐ SO USE A SIDE‐SCAN RADAR.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.922
‐ A SIDE‐SCAN RADAR
GIVES YOU A NICE SLICE

20:57.006 --> 20:58.215
OF THE OCEAN IN 3‐D.

20:58.299 --> 20:59.842
FOR WHAT YOU WANT,

20:59.925 --> 21:01.969
SIDE‐SCAN RADAR
ISN'T RELIABLE ENOUGH.

21:02.052 --> 21:03.971
WHICH IS WHY I WOULD USE
MULTIBEAM.

21:04.054 --> 21:07.099
GIVES YOU A NICE DETAILED
VIEW OF THE OCEAN FLOOR.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.226
‐ SO WHEN CAN WE GET STARTED?

21:09.310 --> 21:11.729
‐ WE JUST DID.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.358
‐ [whistles]

21:18.110 --> 21:20.237
OH, YEAH.

21:20.321 --> 21:21.989
ALL RIGHT.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.532
SO, CHAMP,
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

21:23.616 --> 21:25.034
‐ SCARED.
‐ HMM.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.495
WELL, THAT'S
AN IMPROVEMENT, RIGHT?

21:27.578 --> 21:29.747
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA TELL HIM?
‐ SAME THING YOU DID.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.999
QUINN TRIED TO FORCE US
TO SHOOT UP

21:32.082 --> 21:33.709
TILL, UH, TILL WE SNUCK
OUT OF THERE.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.002
‐ MM‐HMM.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.670
EVEN HAS THE BENEFIT
OF BEING TRUE, MOSTLY.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.005
‐ YEAH.

21:38.005 --> 21:40.174
UM, HOW DO I LOOK?

21:40.257 --> 21:41.217
‐ LOOK IN MY EYES.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.177
YEAH, YOU'RE GOOD.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.762
‐ I MEAN, YOU'RE
A LITTLE BLURRY, BUT‐‐

21:44.845 --> 21:47.014
‐ WELL, THE EYE DROPS PROBABLY
DILATED YOUR PUPILS.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.600
NOW, LOOK, WHEN YOU START
TO COME DOWN OFF THIS STUFF,

21:49.683 --> 21:51.060
REMEMBER TO WATCH YOURSELF,
OKAY?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.686
RESIST THE IMPULSE
TO FIDGET.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.855
NO SUDDEN MOVEMENTS.
DON'T LOOK LIKE A HYPE.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.524
‐ I'VE PLAYED A COVER
BEFORE, PAUL.

21:56.607 --> 21:58.150
‐ YEAH, I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE
USED TO PLAYING HIGH.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.069
NOW YOU'RE HIGH, AND YOU'RE
TRYING TO PLAY SOBER.

22:00.069 --> 22:01.529
IT'S NOT AS EASY
AS YOU'D THINK.

22:01.612 --> 22:03.989
‐ I DON'T NEED A GODDAMN
INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.074
THANK YOU.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.992
‐ LOOK AT THAT,
SHE'S A NATURAL.

22:07.076 --> 22:08.619
‐ KISS MY ASS.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.037
‐ [chuckles]

22:10.120 --> 22:11.497
THERE'S THE CHARLIE
WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.632
‐ WHEN I SPOKE
TO AGENT BRIGGS,

22:21.715 --> 22:24.051
HE SAID HE NEARLY
CAME TO BLOWS WITH QUINN.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.427
‐ YEAH, HE INSISTED
WE SHOOT HIS HEROIN

22:25.511 --> 22:27.012
TO PROVE WE WEREN'T
UNDERCOVERS.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.556
NATURALLY,
WE COULDN'T DO THAT.

22:28.639 --> 22:30.224
‐ WHY DIDN'T YOU LEAVE?

22:30.307 --> 22:32.643
‐ BECAUSE HIS THUGS
WOULD HAVE STOPPED US.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.019
‐ HOW DID YOU GET OUT?

22:34.103 --> 22:36.730
‐ I PRETENDED
TO GO BACK TO THE BATHROOM

22:36.814 --> 22:40.234
TO CHECK ON WHISTLER.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.736
NOTHING DAMPENS A PARTY
LIKE A DEAD JUNKIE.

22:42.820 --> 22:45.197
‐ SO YOU LOST YOUR C.I.

22:45.281 --> 22:49.201
‐ THAT'S RIGHT.
OVERDOSE ON QUINN'S STUFF.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.078
QUINN WAS BRAGGING ABOUT IT
ALL NIGHT,

22:51.161 --> 22:52.621
HOW IT MESSED UP WHISTLER.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.039
‐ ONCE WHISTLER OD'D,

22:54.123 --> 22:55.791
YOU HAD QUINN ON CONSPIRACY
TO DISTRIBUTE

22:55.875 --> 22:57.001
RESULTING IN DEATH.

22:57.001 --> 22:58.460
HOW COULD YOU LET HIM WALK?

22:58.544 --> 23:00.129
‐ 'CAUSE QUINN WASN'T
OUR PRIMARY SUSPECT.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.506
IT WAS ODIN,
AND ODIN DIDN'T SHOW.

23:02.590 --> 23:06.343
‐ THAT CHARGE CARRIES
25 TO LIFE.

23:06.427 --> 23:08.512
YOU COULD HAVE FLIPPED QUINN,
HAD HIM TURN ON ODIN.

23:10.139 --> 23:14.101
AGENT, ARE YOU WITH ME?

23:14.184 --> 23:16.061
‐ YES, SIR.

23:16.145 --> 23:18.022
‐ WELL?

23:18.105 --> 23:21.150
‐ SHE DIDN'T HAVE
A CHOICE, SIR.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.861
THEY WERE OUTNUMBERED,
OUTGUNNED.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.613
IF THEY TRIED TO TAKE
QUINN DOWN BY THEMSELVES,

23:25.696 --> 23:26.989
THEY'D BE DEAD.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.158
MY TAC TEAM WAS TOO FAR AWAY
TO DO ANY GOOD.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.785
THAT'S ON ME.
‐ JOHNNY, DON'T.

23:31.869 --> 23:33.621
‐ SHE COULDN'T TAKE A CHANCE
ON THINGS GOING SOUTH.

23:33.704 --> 23:36.582
‐ FINALLY, THE TRUTH.

23:36.665 --> 23:37.750
‐ THAT'S NOT HOW IT WENT DOWN.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.002
‐ I THINK IT IS.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.880
I UNDERSTAND YOU TRYING
TO COVER FOR YOUR ROOMMATE.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.548
THIS HAS TO GO IN MY REPORT.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.967
‐ I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT.
‐ CHARLIE, HE'S RIGHT.

23:47.051 --> 23:49.219
THE TRUTH HAD TO COME OUT.
SIR, I APOLOGIZE.

23:49.303 --> 23:52.973
‐ THANK YOU.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.975
THAT'S ALL.

24:13.994 --> 24:16.830
‐ WHAT'S UP, CHUCKIE?

24:16.914 --> 24:18.666
HMM?

24:18.749 --> 24:20.960
NORMALLY YOU DOWN THREE OF THESE
FOR EVERY TWO OF MINE.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.337
‐ WELL, I'M SORRY
IF I'M A LITTLE DOWN, JOHNNY.

24:23.420 --> 24:26.966
‐ THAT'S WHEN
YOU EAT THE MOST.

24:27.049 --> 24:29.218
BABY, I KNOW A CRASH
WHEN I SEE IT.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.762
WHAT'S UP?

24:31.845 --> 24:33.389
‐ I SHOT ONE
OF QUINN'S SYRINGES,

24:33.472 --> 24:36.976
AND I MESSED MYSELF UP.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.394
‐ WHAT?

24:38.477 --> 24:39.979
‐ JOHNNY, IT WAS GETTING
SO CRAZY IN THERE.

24:40.062 --> 24:42.648
QUINN HAD HIS THUGS,
THEY HAD HEAT.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.233
BRIGGS WAS IN THEIR FACE.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.110
I KNEW, IF I DIDN'T SHOOT UP,
WE WEREN'T GETTING OUT OF THERE.

24:46.193 --> 24:47.820
‐ YOU KNEW
I'D GET THERE FOR YOU.

24:47.903 --> 24:51.782
‐ I JUST KEPT SEEING
WHISTLER'S FACE.

24:51.865 --> 24:54.118
SEEING HIM LAY THERE
ON THAT FILTHY BATHROOM FLOOR.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.120
HE DIDN'T DESERVE THAT, MAN.

24:58.622 --> 25:01.959
‐ WHY WERE YOU HIGH
IN THE EVAL TODAY?

25:02.042 --> 25:04.420
‐ WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO SAVE MY CAREER, MAN.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.963
GOTTA SHOOT A LITTLE HEROIN
TO LEVEL OUT,

25:05.963 --> 25:09.842
THAT'S WHAT I GOTTA DO.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.510
‐ SO BRIGGS KNOWS TOO, HUH?

25:11.593 --> 25:12.845
‐ YEAH,
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER,

25:12.928 --> 25:13.971
'CAUSE I'M THE ONE
WHO DID IT.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.472
I'M THE ONE WHO MESSED UP.

25:15.556 --> 25:17.391
‐ NOT ACCORDING
TO THE REPORT, CHUCK.

25:17.474 --> 25:19.226
NOW I'M THE ONE
WHO LET QUINN WALK, THANKS.

25:19.309 --> 25:21.186
‐ I'M SORRY, JOHNNY.

25:21.270 --> 25:25.065
‐ I DON'T CARE
WHAT THE STORY WAS.

25:25.149 --> 25:27.109
I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU WENT
OR WHAT YOU DID.

25:27.192 --> 25:29.028
JUST COME HOME.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.112
ALL RIGHT?

25:30.195 --> 25:32.322
LET ME HELP YOU GET BETTER.

25:32.406 --> 25:35.075
YOU HEAR ME?
‐ MM‐HMM. YEAH.

25:35.159 --> 25:38.912
‐ I LOVE YOU.

25:38.996 --> 25:40.622
‐ I LOVE YOU TOO.

25:47.004 --> 25:49.173
‐ ACTUALLY, I MOVED HERE
TO BECOME A PUNK SINGER,

25:49.256 --> 25:51.383
BUT APPARENTLY
NOBODY'S REALLY LOOKING

25:51.467 --> 25:52.593
FOR A FEMALE IGGY POP.

25:52.676 --> 25:53.761
SURPRISING.

25:53.844 --> 25:55.846
AT LEAST AS A SPIN INSTRUCTOR

25:55.929 --> 25:57.056
I STILL GET
TO YELL AT PEOPLE.

25:57.139 --> 25:58.807
‐ YOU CAN YELL AT ME
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.267
‐ DOWN BOY.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.561
UM, ABBY,
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

26:02.644 --> 26:04.646
‐ I'VE BEEN A STUDENT MAINLY.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.273
BUT LAST SUMMER
I WORKED FOR A SENATOR.

26:06.356 --> 26:07.775
‐ IMPRESSIVE.

26:07.858 --> 26:09.443
‐ MY DAD PULLED
A FEW STRINGS.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.945
‐ LOOKS LIKE YOU MIGHT NEED
A FANCIER JOB, MR. PILOT.

26:12.029 --> 26:13.363
‐ I DON'T KNOW.

26:13.447 --> 26:15.032
THERE'S NOTHING QUITE LIKE
THE THRILL OF FLYING.

26:15.115 --> 26:17.034
‐ TELL ME ABOUT IT,
I USED TO FLY CESSNAS.

26:17.034 --> 26:19.203
‐ NO WAY.
REALLY?

26:19.286 --> 26:21.038
‐ WELL, A BUDDY OF MINE,
HE HAD A NETJET MEMBERSHIP.

26:21.038 --> 26:23.248
WE'D GO UP IN THE COCKPIT
AND HAVE A COUPLE BEERS.

26:23.332 --> 26:26.001
‐ SO YOU GUYS DIDN'T
ACTUALLY PILOT THE PLANE.

26:26.085 --> 26:29.088
‐ VANCE HERE IS A D. J.

26:29.171 --> 26:30.297
‐ I'M GUESSING
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD

26:30.380 --> 26:31.882
OF A CLUB DOWNTOWN
CALLED PRIMATOLOGY?

26:31.965 --> 26:34.384
‐ NO WAY, THAT IS
MY GIRLFRIEND'S FAVORITE CLUB.

26:34.468 --> 26:35.969
OH, MY GOD,
WHAT NIGHT ARE YOU ON?

26:36.053 --> 26:37.054
‐ UM‐‐

26:37.137 --> 26:38.972
‐ NO, HE MAINLY DOES
PRIVATE EVENTS

26:38.972 --> 26:40.099
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

26:40.182 --> 26:41.558
‐ I'M USUALLY THERE
ON TUESDAYS,

26:41.642 --> 26:43.602
BUT, UM, HERE,
HERE'S MY CARD.

26:43.685 --> 26:45.020
GIVE ME A CALL.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.105
I'LL SHOW YOU
THE FULL V. I. P. TREATMENT.

26:46.188 --> 26:47.397
‐ ON A TUESDAY.

26:47.481 --> 26:48.732
‐ DAMN RIGHT.

26:48.816 --> 26:49.983
‐ IS THAT
HOW YOU GUYS MET?

26:50.067 --> 26:51.193
‐ KINDA.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.487
I WAS WALKING
DOWNTOWN ONE NIGHT,

26:53.570 --> 26:56.281
AND THIS SUPER HOT CHICK,
SHE RUNS UP TO ME,

26:56.365 --> 26:58.867
AND SHE NOTICES
MY SHIRT.

26:58.951 --> 27:02.496
‐ I MEAN, I'M KIND
OF HIS FIRST GROUPIE, SO...

27:02.579 --> 27:03.664
‐ YOU KNOW WHAT,
FOR SOME REASON

27:03.747 --> 27:04.748
I THINK SHE WON'T
BE YOUR LAST.

27:04.832 --> 27:06.542
‐ THANKS, MIKE.
THANKS.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.043
‐ HEY, PAIGE,
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SEC?

27:08.127 --> 27:10.879
‐ ABSOLUTELY.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.844
‐ SO YOU BROUGHT YOUR CASE
ON OUR DATE.

27:16.927 --> 27:18.929
‐ RELAX, MIKE,
HE'S JUST A DEALER.

27:19.012 --> 27:21.390
‐ HMM. GREAT.
HE'S PREFECT.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.724
‐ LOOK AROUND HERE.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.101
MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN HERE
ARE DEALERS.

27:24.184 --> 27:28.021
OKAY, HE'S JUST
MY WAY INTO AN ECSTASY RING,

27:28.105 --> 27:29.231
AND HE'S NOT EVEN
WORTH FLIPPING.

27:29.314 --> 27:30.816
‐ PAIGE.

27:30.899 --> 27:33.318
ABBY THINKS
THIS IS A REAL DATE.

27:33.402 --> 27:35.028
‐ IS IT?

27:35.112 --> 27:37.447
YOU'RE PRETENDING THAT YOU CAN
HAVE A REAL RELATIONSHIP.

27:37.531 --> 27:39.074
AND IF YOU WERE
BEING HONEST WITH YOURSELF,

27:39.157 --> 27:41.118
YOU'D KNOW THAT
THAT ISN'T POSSIBLE.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.662
NOT WITH WHAT WE DO.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.539
OKAY, LOOK,

27:45.622 --> 27:48.000
THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU
SHOULD CONTINUE DATING

27:48.000 --> 27:51.545
IS IF SHE STARTS
COMMITTING CRIMES.

27:53.463 --> 27:56.300
‐ I THINK
SHE JUST STOLE THE SALT.

27:56.383 --> 27:59.052
SHE DID.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.974
‐ PRETTY INCREDIBLE GUY,
RIGHT?

28:04.057 --> 28:05.642
‐ WHY,
'CAUSE HE'S SO HANDSOME

28:05.726 --> 28:07.102
OR BECAUSE
HE WAS SO DUMB?

28:07.185 --> 28:10.230
‐ PLEASE, NO,
BECAUSE HE'S A DRUG DEALER.

28:10.314 --> 28:11.940
‐ GET OUT OF HERE.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.151
‐ D. J. AFROBURN
GAVE ME HIS CARD

28:14.234 --> 28:16.028
BECAUSE HE WANTED
TO SELL ME DRUGS.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.572
‐ I THOUGHT HE WAS
JUST FLIRTING WITH YOU.

28:18.655 --> 28:21.658
‐ YOU JEALOUS NOW?

28:21.742 --> 28:22.993
‐ THINK WE SHOULD TELL PAIGE?

28:22.993 --> 28:25.162
‐ I HAVE A FEELING
SHE ALREADY KNOWS.

28:25.245 --> 28:26.747
I MEAN, SHE WAS ACTING
KINDA DIFFERENT AROUND HIM.

28:26.830 --> 28:27.748
DON'T YOU THINK?

28:27.831 --> 28:28.916
‐ YEAH.

28:28.999 --> 28:30.083
HE'S NOT REALLY HER TYPE.

28:30.167 --> 28:31.418
‐ I DON'T GET THAT.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.170
I WOULD NEVER ACT DIFFERENT
AROUND A GUY,

28:33.253 --> 28:35.839
AND I HOPE YOU WOULDN'T
ACT DIFFERENT AROUND ME.

28:35.923 --> 28:37.466
‐ I DO.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.926
I'M BETTER.

28:47.851 --> 28:49.561
‐ CORNY.
‐ OH, COME ON.

28:49.645 --> 28:51.229
IT'S TRUE, THOUGH.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.273
[both chuckle]

29:03.116 --> 29:04.952
‐ HEY, YO, FAM.

29:05.035 --> 29:06.995
‐ WHAT'S UP, MAN?

29:06.995 --> 29:08.747
HEARD THE EVAL
WENT ALL RIGHT.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.999
‐ YEAH.
WHY WOULDN'T IT?

29:11.083 --> 29:12.960
‐ TALKED TO THE COAST GUARD.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.461
GOT THEM TO DO
MOST OF THE HEAVY LIFTING

29:14.544 --> 29:15.796
FOR US ON THIS TORPEDO DEAL.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.005
‐ THEY PICKING IT UP OR WHAT?

29:17.089 --> 29:18.465
‐ WELL, THEY GOT A FEW PINGS.

29:18.548 --> 29:19.967
BATHYMETRIC
SAYS THIS ONE RIGHT HERE

29:19.967 --> 29:21.510
AS THE MOST PROBABLE.

29:21.593 --> 29:22.636
I SAY WE DO
A LITTLE RECON,

29:22.719 --> 29:24.429
MAKE SURE IT'S OUR TARGET.

29:24.513 --> 29:25.555
GIVE YOU A CHANCE
TO GET FAMILIARIZED

29:25.639 --> 29:26.974
WITH YOUR NEW BOAT, SKIPPER.

29:27.057 --> 29:28.976
‐ SHOULD WE BRING GILLIGAN
ALONG OR WHAT?

29:29.059 --> 29:30.936
‐ EH, LET MIKE GET HIS REST.

29:31.019 --> 29:34.690
THE ONLY THING HE HAS TO DO
TOMORROW IS LOOK SURPRISED.

29:34.773 --> 29:38.527
‐ WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT CHARLIE?

29:38.610 --> 29:41.780
‐ 'CAUSE I TOLD HER
I WOULDN'T.

29:41.863 --> 29:43.991
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE, J. T.

29:47.744 --> 29:50.038
THIS IS RIGHT, RIGHT?
I MEAN...

29:50.038 --> 29:52.165
‐ ALL RIGHT, FIRST OF ALL,
I WOULDN'T START THERE.

29:52.249 --> 29:54.459
‐ NO?
‐ DEAD SMACK IN THE MIDDLE.

29:54.543 --> 29:55.961
MY MONEY,
THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT.

30:09.016 --> 30:10.809
‐ MAN, WHERE'D YOU LEARN TO
WORK A JOYSTICK LIKE THAT, BRO?

30:10.892 --> 30:12.227
‐ EVER HEARD OF VIDEO GAMES?

30:12.310 --> 30:13.687
‐ COME ON, MAN,
I'M SERIOUS.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.022
‐ IT'S CLASSIFIED.

30:15.022 --> 30:17.357
‐ LOOK, JOHNNY, NOBODY'S
MORE SORRY THAN I AM

30:17.441 --> 30:18.984
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO CHARLIE, OKAY?

30:19.067 --> 30:19.985
SHE WAS BEGGING ME
TO HELP HER.

30:20.068 --> 30:21.111
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

30:21.194 --> 30:24.281
‐ I COVERED FOR HER.

30:24.364 --> 30:27.701
AND FOR YOU.

30:27.784 --> 30:28.869
[beeping]
‐ I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

30:28.952 --> 30:30.537
‐ DIRECT HIT.

30:34.041 --> 30:35.709
HOLD ON, LET ME BACK UP.
LET ME CLEAN IT UP FIRST.

30:37.753 --> 30:39.713
IT'S AN MK‐46.

30:39.796 --> 30:42.007
DECOMMISSIONED
MILITARY TORPEDO.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.383
THAT'S ONE OF OURS.

30:43.467 --> 30:45.886
‐ NOTHING BUT THE BEST
FOR THE CAZA CARTEL, HUH?

30:45.969 --> 30:47.637
‐ IT'S EXPLOSIVE,
YOU SEE THAT?

30:47.721 --> 30:48.972
SEE THE TRIPWIRE
RUNNING ACROSS THE TOP?

30:49.056 --> 30:50.140
‐ YEAH.

30:50.223 --> 30:52.059
‐ THEY BOOBY‐TRAPPED
THE DAMN THING.

30:52.142 --> 30:54.061
DAMN ASSHOLES, MAN.

30:54.144 --> 30:55.395
‐ WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ABORT.

30:55.479 --> 30:58.023
‐ NO, NO, NO, NO,
I'M ACTUALLY TRAINED FOR THIS.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.067
I'LL GO DOWN THERE
AND DIFFUSE IT.

31:00.150 --> 31:02.694
PUT THOSE DRUGS
RIGHT IN BELLO'S HANDS.

31:02.778 --> 31:04.738
‐ THERE'S NO NEED TO TRY
TO BE A HERO, JOHNNY.

31:04.821 --> 31:07.407
‐ BRIGGS, I AM THE HERO.

31:34.559 --> 31:38.271
‐ YEAH, "X" MARKS THE SPOT.

31:45.862 --> 31:47.239
‐ ARE YOU SURE IT'S THERE?

31:47.322 --> 31:49.366
‐ IF IT AIN'T,
I'LL GIVE YOU 20 GRAND.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.076
DEAL?

31:51.159 --> 31:53.036
‐ WAY TO SELL IT, JOHNNY.

31:53.036 --> 31:55.497
ALL RIGHT, <i>MI FAMILIA,</i>
LET'S GET READY TO GO.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.625
‐ THREAD THE STRAPS
ON THE TORPEDO, OKAY?

31:58.708 --> 32:00.043
I'M GONNA INFLATE
THE LIFT BAG

32:00.127 --> 32:01.962
AND THEN PULL ME UP
LIKE A FISH.

32:02.045 --> 32:03.255
‐ ALL RIGHT, MAN.
‐ KEEP THAT.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.048
USE THIS TO STAY IN CONTACT.

32:05.132 --> 32:07.509
HEY, NOBODY TOUCH NOTHING
WHILE I'M GONE.

32:07.592 --> 32:10.220
I'M LOOKING AT YOU.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.108
‐ HEY, JOHNNY,
DO YOU READ ME?

32:23.191 --> 32:24.901
‐ COPY THAT.

32:24.985 --> 32:26.736
LET ME TRY CALL WAITING.

32:26.820 --> 32:28.029
YOU HEAR ME, MIKE?

32:28.029 --> 32:29.865
‐ LOUD AND CLEAR.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.033
THEY DIDN'T TOUCH
ANY OF MY STUFF, DID THEY?

32:32.117 --> 32:34.077
‐ NAH, WE'RE ALL GOOD.

32:35.829 --> 32:37.873
‐ ALL RIGHT,
I GOT A VISUAL.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.833
YEAH, YEAH,
THAT'S THE TORPEDO ALL RIGHT.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.001
LOOKS LIKE I GET
TO KEEP MY MONEY.

32:41.001 --> 32:43.086
‐ GOOD JOB, JOHNNY.

32:43.170 --> 32:47.090
‐ MAY I?

32:47.174 --> 32:48.300
EXCELLENT WORK.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.802
HOW MUCH LONGER WILL YOU BE?

32:50.886 --> 32:52.012
‐ IT'S SITTING FLAT,

32:52.012 --> 32:54.598
SO FIVE MINUTES
TO GET THE STRAPS IN PLACE,

32:54.681 --> 32:56.766
ANOTHER COUPLE
TO INFLATE THE BAG.

32:56.850 --> 32:58.602
‐ THE SOONER
THE BETTER, OKAY?

33:04.816 --> 33:06.943
‐ WHAT'S HE DOING?

33:07.027 --> 33:08.528
‐ FISHING I SUPPOSE.

33:08.612 --> 33:10.405
‐ THAT'S A BIG FISH.

33:10.488 --> 33:13.074
‐ YOUR FRIEND'S PART
IS ALMOST OVER.

33:13.158 --> 33:15.619
HE WON'T BE GOING
BACK TO SHORE WITH US.

33:15.702 --> 33:17.370
‐ WHOA, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT A MINUTE.

33:17.454 --> 33:19.122
YOU CAN'T DO THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

33:19.206 --> 33:20.874
JOHNNY'S DONE EVERYTHING
YOU ASKED FOR.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.292
THIS GUY'S
A TOTAL PRO, OKAY?

33:22.375 --> 33:25.337
‐ DOESN'T MEAN THAT
HE WON'T SHARE WAR STORIES

33:25.420 --> 33:27.130
WITH HIS DRINKING BUDDIES,
HUH?

33:27.214 --> 33:29.507
THAT MONEY BUYS A LOT OF BEER,

33:29.591 --> 33:32.010
BUT WE CAN'T TAKE A CHANCE
WITH THE CARTEL.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.221
BEST TO TIE UP
ALL THE LOOSE ENDS.

33:34.304 --> 33:36.806
‐ YOU DON'T THINK SOMEBODY'S
GONNA NOTICE HIM MISSING?

33:36.890 --> 33:41.311
‐ IF HE'S A PRO,
NO ONE KNOWS HE'S HERE.

33:41.394 --> 33:44.648
HIS FINAL
CLASSIFIED MISSION.

33:44.731 --> 33:46.733
‐ OKAY.
OKAY.

33:49.110 --> 33:51.988
‐ HEY, JOHNNY, I'M ABOUT TO GO
PEYTON MANNING ON YOU, BUDDY.

33:51.988 --> 33:54.449
TELL HIM ABOUT THE BOOBY TRAP,
BUY US SOME TIME.

33:54.532 --> 33:57.452
‐ ALL RIGHT, MAN.
YOU GOT IT.

33:57.535 --> 33:58.411
‐ BRIGGS, MAN, I HOPE
YOU HEARD ALL THAT, MAN.

33:58.495 --> 34:00.121
THEY ARE GONNA KILL JOHNNY.

34:00.205 --> 34:01.581
YOU NEED TO SEND IN
THE CAVALRY RIGHT NOW.

34:01.665 --> 34:03.375
WE DON'T HAVE ANY TIME.

34:03.458 --> 34:07.379
‐ UH, FELLAS,
WE GOT A LITTLE PROBLEM HERE.

34:07.462 --> 34:10.048
THEY BOOBY‐TRAPPED
THIS WHOLE THING WITH SEMTEX.

34:10.131 --> 34:12.384
‐ IS THAT GOING TO BE
A MAJOR PROBLEM?

34:12.467 --> 34:14.010
‐ I CAN DIFFUSE IT,

34:14.094 --> 34:16.680
BUT TAKING BOMBS APART
WASN'T IN MY JOB DESCRIPTION.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.056
IT'S GONNA
COST YOU EXTRA.

34:18.139 --> 34:20.558
‐ I'LL PAY YOU
ANOTHER $5,000.

34:20.642 --> 34:23.061
DON'T BE GREEDY.

34:23.144 --> 34:25.689
MICHAEL,
YOU CAN HAVE HIS SHARE.

34:25.772 --> 34:28.316
‐ I DON'T WANT IT.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.403
‐ I THOUGHT YOU WERE MUCH MORE
OF A MERCENARY THAN THIS, HMM?

34:31.486 --> 34:32.904
YOU WENT OUT OF YOUR WAY

34:32.988 --> 34:35.740
TO FIND SOMEONE WHO IS
IN NO WAY CONNECTED TO ME.

34:35.824 --> 34:37.033
‐ BUT THE GUY'S CONNECTED
TO ME, ALL RIGHT?

34:37.117 --> 34:38.034
HE'S MY FRIEND.

34:38.034 --> 34:40.537
‐ NOW I AM YOUR FRIEND.

34:44.040 --> 34:48.044
‐ ALL RIGHT, THEN‐‐

34:48.128 --> 34:49.754
THEN LET ME DO IT.

34:49.838 --> 34:50.964
YOU NEED YOUR BEST GUY
TO DO THIS.

34:50.964 --> 34:52.757
LET ME MAKE IT CLEAN.

34:52.841 --> 34:54.092
PLEASE.

34:56.720 --> 34:58.972
‐ LOWER YOUR GUN.

34:58.972 --> 35:01.266
FINE.

35:01.349 --> 35:04.978
I DON'T WANT YOUR FRIEND
TO MAKE A MESS ON MY NEW BOAT.

35:05.061 --> 35:06.563
‐ THANK YOU.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.023
‐ HMM.

35:11.026 --> 35:13.278
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD CALL HER?

35:13.361 --> 35:14.988
‐ IT'S BAD LUCK
TO RENAME YOUR BOAT.

35:15.071 --> 35:16.990
‐ EH, BAD LUCK
FOR THE PREVIOUS OWNER.

35:27.167 --> 35:29.669
‐ I'M JUST ABOUT DONE
DISARMING THIS BOMB, BRIGGS.

35:29.753 --> 35:31.046
I REALLY HOPE THIS WORKS, MAN.

35:40.305 --> 35:42.057
‐ HOW'S IT GOING DOWN THERE?

35:42.140 --> 35:42.974
‐ IT'S GOING.

35:43.058 --> 35:44.184
I'VE ALMOST GOT‐‐

35:47.020 --> 35:48.688
‐ HELLO?

35:48.772 --> 35:51.983
HELLO?
HELLO?

35:59.115 --> 36:01.284
WHAT THE HELL?
YOU SAID THIS MAN WAS THE BEST!

36:01.368 --> 36:02.869
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY
YOU COST ME?

36:02.952 --> 36:05.789
THIS IS YOUR FAULT!

36:05.872 --> 36:07.415
TELL ME WHY I SHOULD NOT
THROW YOU DOWN THERE TOO.

36:07.499 --> 36:08.958
‐ 'CAUSE I WAS ABOUT
TO SHOOT HIM FOR YOU!

36:13.004 --> 36:15.006
‐ PUT THAT THING AWAY.

36:17.801 --> 36:20.011
DO SOMETHING!

36:20.095 --> 36:21.262
WE MUST LEAVE
THIS PLACE NOW.

36:21.346 --> 36:22.972
START THE ENGINES.
PULL THE ANCHOR UP NOW.

36:23.056 --> 36:24.182
WE MUST LEAVE THIS PLACE.
GO!

36:24.265 --> 36:25.558
COME ON, WE MUST LEAVE.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.729
[engine starts]

36:32.190 --> 36:35.068
MICHAEL...

36:35.151 --> 36:37.028
I LOST MY HEAD.

36:40.031 --> 36:43.034
I AM SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

37:03.263 --> 37:05.390
‐ BRIGGS, BRIGGS,
IT'S ME, MAN.

37:05.473 --> 37:08.977
I THINK JOHNNY'S, UM...

37:08.977 --> 37:10.979
DUDE, YOU GOTTA
CALL ME BACK, ALL RIGHT?

37:11.062 --> 37:14.149
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?
JESUS CHRIST.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.776
SORRY.

37:21.322 --> 37:24.033
‐ YO, MIKEY MIKE.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.827
THAT WAS GOOD WORK.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.412
‐ JOHNNY.

37:27.495 --> 37:28.872
JOHN, JOHN, JOHN.

37:28.955 --> 37:31.040
‐ DUDE, DUDE! DUDE, NOBODY
TOLD YOU I WAS OKAY?

37:31.124 --> 37:32.000
‐ I COULDN'T GET BRIGGS
ON THE PHONE.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.376
‐ WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?

37:33.460 --> 37:34.586
‐ 'CAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU WERE DEAD.

37:34.669 --> 37:35.837
WHY WOULD I CALL YOU?

37:35.920 --> 37:37.172
‐ DUDE, IS THAT A TEAR?

37:37.255 --> 37:41.092
I'M TOUCHED, DUDE, BUT
YOU REALLY THOUGHT I WAS DEAD?

37:41.176 --> 37:42.927
‐ LOOK, IT'S NOT A TEAR,
ALL RIGHT?

37:43.011 --> 37:44.137
‐ MIKEY, I HAD THE BOMB
COVERED THE WHOLE WAY.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.556
IT WAS A PIECE OF CAKE.
I KNEW IT WOULD BE.

37:46.639 --> 37:49.100
‐ YOU KNEW ABOUT THE BOMB?

37:49.184 --> 37:50.852
‐ YEAH, WE SAW IT
ON THE R. O. V.

37:50.935 --> 37:52.061
BRIGGS DIDN'T TELL YOU?

37:52.145 --> 37:54.731
‐ YO, JOHNNY, SODA MACHINE
WAS BROKEN, BROTHER.

37:54.814 --> 37:56.858
I GOT YOU WATER INSTEAD.

37:56.941 --> 37:59.152
‐ YO, YO, YO, MIKE, CHILL!
DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

37:59.235 --> 38:00.820
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
CHILL.

38:00.904 --> 38:02.030
‐ I THOUGHT JOHNNY WAS DEAD,
BRIGGS.

38:02.030 --> 38:03.990
‐ MIKE, RELAX.

38:03.990 --> 38:05.450
‐ WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT THE BOMB?

38:05.533 --> 38:07.035
‐ I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO DERAIL YOUR OWN PLAN.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.495
‐ OH, SO YOU JUST MAKE
THAT DECISION FOR ME?

38:08.578 --> 38:09.996
‐ YES, THE HELL I DID!

38:10.079 --> 38:11.080
I MEAN, WHAT DID YOU THINK,

38:11.164 --> 38:12.624
JOHNNY JUST HAPPENED
TO FIND THE BOMB

38:12.707 --> 38:14.000
THE SECOND AFTER
YOU CALLED IN THE CAVALRY?

38:14.083 --> 38:15.001
‐ GOD DAMN IT, BRIGGS.

38:15.001 --> 38:17.003
I ALMOST SHOT THOSE GUYS.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.630
‐ AGENT WARREN,
I CALLED AN AUDIBLE,

38:18.713 --> 38:20.673
AND WE SCORED.

38:23.468 --> 38:26.095
‐ WHAT'D YOU DO DOWN THERE?

38:26.179 --> 38:27.514
‐ BRIGGS SAYS,
"SURFACE AND YOU'RE DEAD."

38:27.597 --> 38:29.057
I PULLED THE SEMTEX

38:29.140 --> 38:30.517
AWAY FROM THE TORPEDO
AND DETONATED IT.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.976
‐ HAD ME FOOLED.

38:31.976 --> 38:34.896
‐ BELLO TOO.
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT, MIKE.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.023
‐ I BET HE WAS PISSED WHEN
WE BLEW UP HIS DRUGS, HUH?

38:37.106 --> 38:38.983
‐ THAT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.151
‐ YEAH, WELL,
IMAGINE HOW PISSED HE'D BE

38:40.235 --> 38:43.112
IF HE KNEW WE HAD 'EM.

38:44.948 --> 38:46.658
‐ MM, DAMN.
[whistles]

38:46.741 --> 38:48.993
FUNNY THING IS,
THEY DIDN'T PACK IT TOO WELL.

38:49.077 --> 38:50.620
THEY COULD HAVE FIT
TWICE AS MUCH IN HERE.

38:50.703 --> 38:51.746
‐ WHY DIDN'T THEY?

38:51.830 --> 38:53.039
‐ BEATS ME.

38:53.039 --> 38:54.874
USUALLY THESE GUYS
DON'T MISS A TRICK.

38:54.958 --> 38:56.584
‐ WELL, KUDOS ANYWAY, BOYS.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.169
IT'S STILL THE BIGGEST HAUL
I'VE EVER SEEN.

38:58.253 --> 38:59.796
THAT'S FOR SURE.
‐ RIGHT.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.589
‐ TOO BAD NO ONE CAN EVER
KNOW WE SEIZED IT.

39:01.673 --> 39:02.757
‐ WHY THE HELL NOT?

39:02.841 --> 39:04.342
‐ WELL, MIKE,
WE CAN'T EXACTLY

39:04.425 --> 39:05.885
THROW A PRESS CONFERENCE.

39:05.969 --> 39:08.054
BELLO WOULD KNOW
HE'D BEEN HAD.

39:08.137 --> 39:10.223
‐ WE HAVE HIM.

39:10.306 --> 39:12.308
WE HAVE HIM ON INTENTION
TO POSSESS NARCOTICS

39:12.392 --> 39:13.852
AND ATTEMPTED MURDER.

39:13.935 --> 39:15.520
‐ I DIDN'T HEAR HIM
TELL YOU TO KILL JOHNNY.

39:15.603 --> 39:17.105
‐ BRIGGS‐‐

39:17.188 --> 39:18.565
‐ LOOK, ALL BELLO SAID WAS
SOMETHING ABOUT GOING FISHING.

39:18.648 --> 39:20.942
MIKE, THE ONLY THING WE HAVE
THE GUY FOR IS STEALING A BOAT.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.735
‐ SO WE'RE JUST
GONNA DO NOTHING?

39:22.819 --> 39:24.362
‐ WELL, I WOULDN'T
SAY THAT.

39:24.445 --> 39:26.656
BIG FISH LIKE BELLO
LEAD TO BIGGER FISH,

39:26.739 --> 39:28.032
LIKE THE CAZA CARTEL.

39:28.116 --> 39:29.284
WE LET THIS ONE PLAY OUT
A LITTLE WHILE LONGER,

39:29.367 --> 39:30.994
WE'LL GET 'EM,
YOU'LL SEE.

39:30.994 --> 39:33.162
I GOTTA GO CLEAR MY HEAD.

39:33.246 --> 39:37.709
GETTING PUNCHED IN THE FACE
DIDN'T QUITE DO IT FOR ME.

39:37.792 --> 39:38.793
‐ HMM.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.920
‐ DADDY KNOWS BEST, HUH?

39:41.004 --> 39:42.422
MIGHT AS WELL
KEEP THINGS TO HIMSELF.

39:42.505 --> 39:44.173
HE AIN'T LISTENING
TO ANYBODY ELSE ANYWAY.

39:44.257 --> 39:45.967
‐ I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY WE BOTHERED WITH THIS.

39:45.967 --> 39:48.011
WE SHOULD HAVE
JUST BLOWN UP THE DRUGS.

39:48.094 --> 39:50.597
‐ THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I SAID,
BUT HE INSISTED.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.307
WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE WATER
I WAS LIKE,

39:52.390 --> 39:55.018
"FINE, MAN, YOU TAKE IT.
I'M DONE, DUDE."

39:55.101 --> 39:56.561
‐ BRIGGS TOOK CUSTODY
OF THE DRUGS?

39:56.644 --> 39:59.355
‐ YEAH, I CAUGHT A RIDE
WITH THE TAC TEAM.

40:21.836 --> 40:23.171
[engine starts]

40:44.484 --> 40:45.944
‐ HOME SWEET HOME.

40:46.027 --> 40:48.196
‐ YEAH, I'M KINDA RELIEVED
NOBODY'S HERE.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.573
‐ YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA WANT
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU, RIGHT?

40:50.657 --> 40:52.659
‐ YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I'M AFRAID OF.

40:52.742 --> 40:54.994
‐ YOU GONNA TELL 'EM?

40:55.078 --> 40:56.496
‐ I MEAN,
THERE'S NOT MUCH TO TELL.

40:56.579 --> 40:58.998
IT'S NOT LIKE I'LL BE SHOOTING
UP IN AN ALLEY OR ANYTHING.

40:58.998 --> 41:00.291
‐ YOU WON'T?

41:00.375 --> 41:02.418
[chuckles]

41:02.502 --> 41:04.796
‐ KILL ME IF I DO.
‐ I WILL.

41:04.879 --> 41:06.172
‐ [sighs]

41:06.255 --> 41:09.509
‐ YUP.
I MEAN, IT'S YOUR CALL, BABE.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.886
I'M GLAD
TO HAVE YOU BACK, THOUGH.

41:33.616 --> 41:36.035
[horn blasting]

41:49.090 --> 41:51.050
‐ I'M GLAD YOU SHOWED UP.

42:07.275 --> 42:09.986
ALL RIGHT, I THINK WE'RE
READY TO GET STARTED.

42:10.069 --> 42:11.404
WHY DOESN'T EVERYONE
TAKE YOUR SEAT?

42:11.487 --> 42:13.698
‐ DO YOU MIND IF I SIT HERE?
‐ PAUL, THE FLOOR IS YOURS.

42:13.781 --> 42:16.576
‐ [clears throat]

42:27.712 --> 42:30.006
HI, MY NAME IS PAUL.
all: HI, PAUL.

42:30.089 --> 42:31.966
‐ I'M A HEROIN ADDICT.
