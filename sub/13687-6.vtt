Previously on
"Ex on the Beach"...

00:03.703 --> 00:06.439
{\an8}Ten loveless reality stars
search for a soulmate

00:06.506 --> 00:08.441
{\an8}right in front of their exes.

00:08.508 --> 00:10.443
{\an5}(all chanting)
Free the bitch!
Free the bitch!

00:10.510 --> 00:13.680
{\an5}(narrator)
Farrah got back from court,
but the verdict's still out

00:13.747 --> 00:15.281
if she's a changed woman.

00:15.348 --> 00:16.916
What a surprise.

00:16.983 --> 00:18.785
(narrator)
Diandra got two cut votes

00:18.852 --> 00:21.788
but managed to survive
another elimination.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.391
The same can't be said
for Maya's ex, Kareem,

00:24.457 --> 00:28.695
{\an5}and Murray's ex Cory Z,
who were both sent packing
after a tie vote.

00:28.762 --> 00:31.164
{\an5}I mean, we'll have to
send them both home.

00:28.762 --> 00:31.164
Oh, (bleep), look.

00:31.231 --> 00:33.867
{\an5}(narrator)
Malcolm failed to reconcile
with his ex Nurys.

00:33.933 --> 00:35.702
{\an5}You do not have my back.

00:33.933 --> 00:35.702
Don't put this out on me.

00:35.769 --> 00:38.438
{\an5}(narrator)
So the door is reopened for
Malcolm and Maya

00:38.505 --> 00:40.240
to pick things up
where they left off.

00:40.306 --> 00:42.008
Today's my day, bitch.

00:42.075 --> 00:45.912
{\an8}(narrator)
And tonight, Janelle loses it on
someone in the house

00:45.979 --> 00:47.414
{\an8}during a jealous rage.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.249
(overlapping shouting)

00:49.315 --> 00:52.685
But she's just warming up the
ring for Farrah's main event.

Today's forecast in Malibu
is a lot of sun

01:16.176 --> 01:18.445
but also a lot of shade.

01:18.511 --> 01:21.314
Although Murray's ex Cory Z
was sent home,

01:21.381 --> 01:24.951
{\an5}Cheyenne's questioning
why Murray chose not
to vote him out.

01:25.018 --> 01:29.589
{\an5}Nicole and Chad are
growing stronger and

And Jozea and Janelle
are feeling confident

01:41.835 --> 01:44.637
{\an8}that their (bleep) drought
may soon be over.

01:46.372 --> 01:51.644
{\an8}I am awaiting seeing my ex to
get all the answers that I need

01:51.711 --> 01:53.880
{\an8}so that I can
pursue a life with him.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.049
{\an8}I'm telling you, they gonna
bring yours last.

01:59.986 --> 02:02.789

02:02.856 --> 02:06.125
{\an5}Who do you think those
two cut votes came from?

02:02.856 --> 02:06.125
Janelle and Maya.

02:06.192 --> 02:08.895
{\an5}Why would she vote for
you if she wants to get
Kareem out, though?

02:08.961 --> 02:11.764
{\an4}That's a way of letting
you know, like, we're
still coming for you.

02:15.568 --> 02:18.404
{\an8}(bleep), like...

02:18.471 --> 02:22.709
{\an8}I don't think there's
anything left for Diandra
to work out with Malcolm

02:22.775 --> 02:27.447
{\an8}and the longer she's here,
it's like she's just
trying to start something,

02:27.514 --> 02:28.781
{\an8}and it's just not genuine.

02:28.848 --> 02:32.018
{\an8}Malcolm is with my girl Maya
so she gotta go.

02:32.085 --> 02:34.587

{\an8}I would love if Murray was all

02:56.509 --> 03:01.548

will be great

03:28.474 --> 03:29.776
and then after three days,

03:29.842 --> 03:31.811
I'll leave and it'll be
back to normal.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.713
Then I won't see him

you're Mr. Big.

03:33.780 --> 03:36.583

{\an8}Maya and Malcolm
came to my room.

03:49.462 --> 03:51.230
{\an8}I know exactly
what's about to happen,

03:51.297 --> 03:52.498

03:52.565 --> 03:54.400
Mwah!

03:54.467 --> 03:56.235
{\an8}Now that Kareem
is out of the house,

03:56.302 --> 03:58.938
{\an8}I think it's time for
me and Maya to spice
it up a little bit.

03:59.005 --> 04:02.241
{\an8}Now all I see is her and there's
no distractions left,

{\an8}Don't worry about who I'm
hooking up with with my penis.

04:31.404 --> 04:32.672
{\an8}I'm good and we're good.

04:32.739 --> 04:34.874
I've never had anything
to worry about with her,

04:34.941 --> 04:40.013

you're on "Are You The One?"

get to know her

05:10.743 --> 05:12.879

than we've currently been doing.

boneless, skinless chicken.

skinless chicken.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.189

I'll make you a good one.

won't throw it on you.

when Chad asked me out on a date

05:34.834 --> 05:41.007
{\an8}because I feel like it's
gonna be more of like a
high-pressured situation,

05:41.074 --> 05:44.944
{\an8}getting to know somebody
more on a more intense level
than when you're by yourself

05:45.011 --> 05:46.846
{\an8}rather than in
a group setting of people.

05:46.913 --> 05:50.083

a date tonight.

33:20.098 --> 33:23.167
{\an1}I just have a feeling
that, like, she would come in

33:23.234 --> 33:28.773
{\an4}and befriend everyone else
and then be kind of like...
like, thirsty.

33:28.840 --> 33:32.610
{\an5}So does that mean we
gotta get her a nice
cup of water?

33:28.840 --> 33:32.610
That's a perfect plan.

33:32.677 --> 33:35.513
{\an5}How many kids do you want?

33:32.677 --> 33:35.513
I want, like, two kids.

33:35.580 --> 33:39.784
{\an5}Three, tops.
Absolute tops.

33:35.580 --> 33:39.784
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.153
{\an5}Three is like...
Like, the third one
is like, oops.

33:42.220 --> 33:45.656
{\an8}Would I be a good baby daddy
for Nicole? I don't know.

33:45.723 --> 33:47.825
{\an8}I mean, I might be a good daddy.

33:47.892 --> 33:50.094
{\an8}I don't know about, like,
a baby daddy.

33:50.161 --> 33:51.896
{\an8}It just sounds expensive.

33:51.963 --> 33:55.900
{\an5}I'm taking this thing off.

33:51.963 --> 33:55.900
What are you doing here?

33:55.967 --> 33:59.937
{\an5}Trying to pull out the twins.

33:55.967 --> 33:59.937
{\an1}Yeah.

34:00.004 --> 34:03.307
{\an8}I gotta give him
something, you know?
But not everything.

34:03.374 --> 34:06.244
{\an4}I didn't expect, coming
in here, to, like, actually
like somebody at all.

34:06.310 --> 34:09.147
{\an5}This is like a curve
ball for me.

34:06.310 --> 34:09.147
No, same here, same here.

34:09.213 --> 34:11.581
{\an4}Right after I talked
to you and kind of got
to know you a little bit

34:11.649 --> 34:13.784
{\an1}and you had the, like,
serious, fun, cool,

34:13.851 --> 34:16.788
{\an5}actually, like,
down-to-earth
smart girl vibe.

34:13.851 --> 34:16.788
{\an3}Yeah.

34:16.853 --> 34:18.121
And that's what I wanted.

I look like I'm kind of
dumb but I'm really not.

34:20.056 --> 34:21.592
{\an1}No, I know you're smart.
I can tell.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.561
Good. Hopefully,
it turns you on.

34:23.628 --> 34:26.431
{\an1}Just keep getting angry.
I like that (bleep).

34:26.496 --> 34:28.800
You want me to get mad?
So, when...

34:28.866 --> 34:31.402

I'll get really (bleep) mad.

{\an8}(Nurys)
So I'm having a conversation
with Darian.

34:51.656 --> 34:54.792
{\an8}I want to understand where his
head is at because I don't think
Darian's in the wrong.

34:54.859 --> 34:58.062
{\an8}I think Janelle just doesn't
really know where she stands in
her relationship

34:58.129 --> 35:00.298
{\an8}and she thinks it's
a lot better than it really is.

35:00.364 --> 35:03.067
{\an5}Diandra, she's cool. Like,
me and her were hitting
it off, whoop-de-woo,

35:03.134 --> 35:07.805
{\an5}but I wouldn't kiss her
right in front of
(bleep) Janelle,

35:07.872 --> 35:11.275
you know what I'm saying?
I wouldn't do that.

35:11.342 --> 35:15.213
{\an4}Exactly. But, like,
you say you guys haven't
spoken for five months

35:15.279 --> 35:20.184
{\an4}and she hasn't done
anything but speak highly of
you, so I'm confused as to,

35:20.251 --> 35:22.153
{\an1}why didn't you guys work
this out in the real world?

35:22.220 --> 35:27.225
{\an5}Cheyenne, how are you?
My little meatball.

35:22.220 --> 35:27.225
{\an1}Yes?

35:30.661 --> 35:32.463
{\an5}Talking about where?

35:30.661 --> 35:32.463
Over here.

35:32.530 --> 35:38.002
{\an8}I think Farrah is about
to stir the pot. Nurys,
I wish you good luck.

35:38.069 --> 35:40.905
{\an5}How are you guys?

35:38.069 --> 35:40.905
{\an3}We're good.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.407
{\an5}Are you feeling better?

35:40.972 --> 35:43.407
Yeah, I'm feeling great.

{\an8}Farrah, she's (bleep) crazy.
Look, I don't know who you are,

35:46.878 --> 35:48.346
{\an8}but you need to take a step
back.

35:48.412 --> 35:51.616
{\an5}Can we have our
conversation, though?

35:48.412 --> 35:51.616
Sure you can.

35:51.682 --> 35:55.152
{\an5}But, yeah, so...

35:51.682 --> 35:55.152
Hold on.

35:55.219 --> 35:59.957
{\an8}I'm here for Janelle. Whether
this dum-dum knows it or not,

36:00.024 --> 36:05.663
{\an8}I'm friends with his ex and
Nurys and Diandra contribute
to only negativity.

36:05.730 --> 36:07.999
Can we have the conversation
without you?

36:08.065 --> 36:11.469

{\an5}Then, can we continue
somewhere else?

{\an1}No, you... you
just continue it.

36:19.076 --> 36:20.778
{\an8}I don't know why,
out of nowhere,

36:20.845 --> 36:22.880
{\an8}you decide to finally get up out

Explain it, 'cause
you don't know me from...

so important that you
can't talk normally?

No, we can speak normally
without you here.

you shouldn't be talking to.

can't quit fighting, so
they're sent to time out.

A new ex joins the house

the Shack of Secrets
