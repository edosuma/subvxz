My name is James Avery.

01:18.817 --> 01:20.297
I'm a physicist.

01:20.428 --> 01:22.691
I'm working on the particleacceleration program.

01:25.346 --> 01:26.738
project?

01:26.869 --> 01:29.350
I would love to talkabout the projects we do.

01:29.480 --> 01:34.268
All our work into particle
acceleration it's, um--

01:34.398 --> 01:35.443
I'm not at liberty to say.

01:39.969 --> 01:41.188
The writing was on the wall.

01:41.318 --> 01:43.146
Energy surges that
didn't make any sense.

01:43.277 --> 01:47.194
There were shifts in geologicaldata that no one could explain,

01:47.324 --> 01:51.850
and everyone thought it wasglitches, software malfunctions

01:51.981 --> 01:55.027
but no one wanted to listen.

02:06.038 --> 02:08.650
The grids couldn't cope
with this extra energy.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.347
It had nowhere to go.

02:10.478 --> 02:14.438
And once it dissipated,
there was still

02:14.569 --> 02:17.876
residual impacts
and resurges, sort

02:18.007 --> 02:20.401
of like, aftershocks, tremors.

Pandemonium everywhere.

You can not the authorities.

02:26.102 --> 02:26.972
You couldn't even get through.

With all these
energy surges, it's

02:33.196 --> 02:36.982
been difficult to keep track ofeveryone and locate everyone.

02:37.113 --> 02:40.638
Uh, and some people
are still missing.

02:45.469 --> 02:49.430
There are rumors that
maybe it's biblical.

02:49.560 --> 02:57.351

um, I just don't know.

13:39.775 --> 13:41.385
Ma'am, please, emergencypersonnel are on their way

13:41.516 --> 13:42.734
to you.

13:42.865 --> 13:43.387
WOMAN : I
think I heard her.

13:43.518 --> 13:44.562
She's inside.

13:44.693 --> 13:45.912
Please, I'm
sending help, ma'am.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.391
WOMAN : Victoria!

13:47.522 --> 13:48.349
Ma'am.

14:56.765 --> 14:57.679
What is it?

14:57.809 --> 14:58.680
I don't know.

15:21.659 --> 15:21.921
STAN: Can you hear that?

15:51.472 --> 15:52.821
It wants us to go through.

15:56.651 --> 15:57.304
Stan.

15:57.434 --> 15:57.913
STAN: Shh.

16:03.266 --> 16:04.224
OK, everybody.

16:04.354 --> 16:05.616
Leave your things.

16:05.747 --> 16:08.054
Calmly get to the stairs.

16:08.184 --> 16:09.969
What about the 9-1-1 calls.

16:10.099 --> 16:10.882
Fuck the calls.

16:18.325 --> 16:19.065
Fuck, it's not working.

16:19.195 --> 16:21.110
Here, try my card.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.634
What are your plans?

16:23.765 --> 16:26.246
Fuck!

16:26.376 --> 16:29.162
I'll get somebody up here.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.554
STAN: I'm with you 100%

16:43.872 --> 16:47.484
Stan, do you
know what this is?

16:47.615 --> 16:49.660
Don't encourage him.

16:49.791 --> 16:50.922
STAN: I want this.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.272
We're not supposed
to be around it.

16:52.402 --> 16:54.013
I think it's-- it's
nuclear or something.

16:54.143 --> 16:56.102
Well, if it was radioactiveour hair would be falling out

16:56.232 --> 16:57.277
and shit.

16:57.407 --> 16:58.452
Right, Robert?

16:58.582 --> 17:00.149
Fuck do I know?

17:00.280 --> 17:02.586
Stan, quit fucking around!

17:05.720 --> 17:09.202
Why is it doing that?

17:09.332 --> 17:11.508
It's listening.

17:11.639 --> 17:15.730
Seriously, Stan, we're notsupposed to be around it.

17:15.860 --> 17:19.690
Stan, how do you
know about these doors.

17:19.821 --> 17:20.430
He don't know shit.

17:24.826 --> 17:27.611
The calls.

17:27.742 --> 17:30.484
Calls, what calls.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.921
Kathy knows.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.444
What fucking calls, Kathy!

17:34.575 --> 17:35.489
From a couple of years ago.

17:35.619 --> 17:36.925
We couldn't trace the number.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.232
The phone people
said they didn't exist.

17:39.362 --> 17:41.321
It was a glitch in the system.

17:41.451 --> 17:45.586
They're about mysteriousdoors just like today.

17:45.716 --> 17:47.631
What does any of that mean?

17:47.762 --> 17:49.198
Nothing.

17:49.329 --> 17:50.852
He got these ideas rightafter the school shooting

17:50.982 --> 17:53.246
and right before
they suspended him.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.074
You mean you, right?

17:55.204 --> 17:56.814
You wanted me fired.

17:56.945 --> 17:59.861
Stan, none of the shitin your head makes sense.

17:59.991 --> 18:01.689
None of it.

18:01.819 --> 18:02.951
It said you'd say that.

18:08.087 --> 18:08.957
LARRY: Aw fuck.

18:12.613 --> 18:15.268
It wants us to go through.

18:15.398 --> 18:20.142
Stan, you don't
want to do this.

18:20.273 --> 18:23.798
It doesn't matter what I want.

18:27.715 --> 18:33.242
If you think there'sanother way, there isn't.

18:36.593 --> 18:40.031
Larry, you're first.

18:40.162 --> 18:40.989
Me?

18:41.120 --> 18:42.338
Why me?

18:42.469 --> 18:45.341
It won't hurt, I swear.

18:45.472 --> 18:46.255
No.

18:46.386 --> 18:47.213
No fucking way, Stan.

18:47.343 --> 18:49.432
It will make me kill you.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.652
We all have to go.

18:51.782 --> 18:52.653
Nobody's touching that thing.

18:52.783 --> 18:54.829
We have to do what it says!

18:54.959 --> 18:55.786
KATHY: Put the gun down.

19:02.402 --> 19:03.229
Oh my god!

19:03.359 --> 19:04.752
Oh my god, dude!

19:04.882 --> 19:07.189
What the fuck are you doing?

19:11.759 --> 19:14.501
I'll kill--

19:14.631 --> 19:16.372
I'll kill all of you.

19:16.503 --> 19:17.112
OK!

19:17.243 --> 19:18.940
OK, just stop!

19:19.070 --> 19:20.159
Just stop, see, stop.

19:47.621 --> 19:50.928
I don't wanna.

19:51.059 --> 19:53.931
Go.

19:54.062 --> 19:56.325
LARRY:  I don't.

19:56.456 --> 19:56.891
No.

20:01.983 --> 20:04.638
It'll be OK.

20:25.833 --> 20:28.749
It worked.

20:28.879 --> 20:29.924
Oh fuck this.

20:30.054 --> 20:32.709
We gotta get the
hell out of here.

20:32.840 --> 20:33.623
No!

20:36.583 --> 20:39.847
Robert's going to die, Stan.

20:39.977 --> 20:44.330
Marie, your next.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.157
No, you saw what
it did to him.

20:46.288 --> 20:47.681
You killed him.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.552
I'm not killing myself.

20:49.683 --> 20:50.205
Sarah is there.

20:53.121 --> 20:55.428
She went through.

20:55.558 --> 20:59.083
That's why she hasn'tbeen answering your phone.

20:59.214 --> 21:01.956
You can't know that.

21:02.086 --> 21:02.565
STAN: She's scared.

21:05.351 --> 21:06.830
She needs her mommy.

21:09.616 --> 21:11.444
KATHY: Tori, don't.

21:11.574 --> 21:12.227
He's playing you.

21:22.890 --> 21:23.369
It'll be OK.

21:26.459 --> 21:27.198
Tori, don't.

21:27.329 --> 21:28.852
Don't listen to him?

21:28.983 --> 21:29.810
Stay away from her.

21:29.940 --> 21:30.463
OK.

21:30.593 --> 21:32.073
OK.

21:32.203 --> 21:32.813
Get away.

21:39.907 --> 21:42.736
KATHY:  Do
what you need to do.

21:56.271 --> 21:59.143
Just reach out and touch it.

22:04.453 --> 22:05.367
We'll be right behind you.

22:13.506 --> 22:15.029
She has what?

22:29.348 --> 22:32.263
Stay away.

22:32.394 --> 22:33.787
All of you.

22:43.710 --> 22:44.188
Why?

22:47.801 --> 22:49.150
Why'd she do that?

22:54.721 --> 22:57.463
You ruined everything.

22:57.593 --> 22:58.377
You ruined everything.

23:03.207 --> 23:05.993
Me?

23:06.123 --> 23:07.777
You can't blame me for this.

23:07.908 --> 23:08.778
Stan.

23:08.909 --> 23:09.562
This is not my fault.

23:09.692 --> 23:10.737
KATHY: Stan

23:10.867 --> 23:12.086
Shut up.

23:12.216 --> 23:13.566
We need to get
somebody up here.

23:13.696 --> 23:17.787
This is your fault. You
gave her the scissors.

23:17.918 --> 23:20.224
KATHY: Stan.

23:20.355 --> 23:21.617
Don't.

23:21.748 --> 23:23.924
We have known each
other such a long time.

23:24.054 --> 23:25.273
I know you.

23:25.404 --> 23:25.882
Don't.

23:34.674 --> 23:35.152
I'm going.

23:42.072 --> 23:42.638
I'm next.

24:05.574 --> 24:08.708
Please let me in.

24:08.838 --> 24:10.710
Come on!

24:10.840 --> 24:12.407
Let me in!

24:12.538 --> 24:15.279
Oh, please.

24:15.410 --> 24:17.456
I did what you asked.

24:17.586 --> 24:20.371
Yeah, I did.

24:20.502 --> 24:23.766
You lied!

24:23.897 --> 24:33.994
You-- you fucking lied.

24:36.605 --> 24:37.476
Oh, god.

25:17.690 --> 25:19.387
Police are on their way up.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.170
They're in the building.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.308
Kathy?

25:27.438 --> 25:27.874
Huh?

25:33.401 --> 25:33.836
Uh.

25:57.904 --> 26:00.254
POLICEMAN: Clear.

26:00.384 --> 26:01.255
Where are they?

26:37.117 --> 26:37.596
Hello?

26:40.947 --> 26:41.382
Hello?

26:46.474 --> 26:48.868
Can anyone hear me?

26:53.002 --> 26:53.524
Hello?

26:56.005 --> 26:56.484
Hello?

27:02.882 --> 27:04.753
Hello?

27:04.884 --> 27:05.319
Anyone?

27:14.720 --> 27:16.417
, what the fuck?

27:19.768 --> 27:20.290
Mr. Reed.

27:20.421 --> 27:21.552
Jesus.

27:21.683 --> 27:22.728
You need to stay in bed.

27:22.858 --> 27:24.381
W-- where-- where am I?

27:24.512 --> 27:26.340
You're at Valley Hospital.

27:26.470 --> 27:28.559
You were in a very
serious accident.

27:28.690 --> 27:29.517
Is my family OK?

27:29.648 --> 27:30.300
Where's my family?

27:30.431 --> 27:31.040
Please, Mr. Reed.

27:31.171 --> 27:31.737
No, no, no.

27:31.867 --> 27:32.607
Where are they?

27:32.738 --> 27:35.088
Your family is fine.

27:35.218 --> 27:36.306
I promise.

27:36.437 --> 27:37.568
Now, if you'd just
sit down and let

27:37.699 --> 27:40.049
me put the IV back
in your arm, I'll

27:40.180 --> 27:40.920
tell you everything I know.

27:47.970 --> 27:50.016
Your wife left to
drop your daughter off

27:50.146 --> 27:51.844
at her Nana's house.

27:51.974 --> 27:54.150
She said she would
be back here to see

27:54.281 --> 27:56.500
you as soon as she could.

27:56.631 --> 27:59.155
And they weren't
hurt or anything?

27:59.286 --> 28:02.419
Like I said, they're fine.

28:02.550 --> 28:04.770
What's the last
thing you remember?

28:04.900 --> 28:10.384
I was driving and there
was, like, a black box.

28:10.514 --> 28:14.040
It was just in the
middle of the road.

28:14.170 --> 28:17.652
Just floating there.

28:17.783 --> 28:19.785
You're lucky to
be alive, you know?

28:19.915 --> 28:20.350
Yeah.

28:23.353 --> 28:25.878
Wait, what do you mean?

28:26.008 --> 28:29.359
You're the first person who'shit one of them that survived.

28:29.490 --> 28:32.623
But you just said
my family was OK.

28:32.754 --> 28:34.887
Right.

28:35.017 --> 28:35.931
Besides them.

28:36.062 --> 28:37.150
Well, wh-- where's my phone?

28:37.280 --> 28:38.194
I have to call my wife.

28:38.325 --> 28:39.979
Just lay back and rest.

28:40.109 --> 28:42.895
And I'm going to talk
to the other doctor

28:43.025 --> 28:44.287
about contacting your family.

28:44.418 --> 28:46.115
Do it right now, though.

28:46.246 --> 28:48.944
Doctor, what-- what's your name?

28:49.075 --> 28:50.337
You can call me Leslie.

28:50.467 --> 28:51.642
I'll be taking care
of you from now on.

29:00.782 --> 29:02.479
Please, try to hold still.

29:02.610 --> 29:03.611
I'll try.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.221
LESLIE: Any headaches, nausea?

29:05.352 --> 29:06.745
No.

29:06.875 --> 29:09.356
I-- I just can't seeanything out of this one.

29:09.486 --> 29:11.532
It's not even black.

29:11.662 --> 29:14.535
His optic nerve was severed.

29:14.665 --> 29:15.884
Can you fix it?

29:16.015 --> 29:17.146
LESLIE: Well, it's
not something we can--

29:17.277 --> 29:19.496
Nerves don't work that way.

29:19.627 --> 29:22.108
Once they go--

29:22.238 --> 29:24.458
I'm afraid there's
some bad news, as well.

29:24.588 --> 29:25.894
We are going to
have to lose this eye.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.288
What?

29:28.418 --> 29:32.422
Not enough blood flow nowto keep the tissue alive.

29:32.553 --> 29:34.033
ADAM: Did you call my wife?

29:34.163 --> 29:35.164
Yes.

29:35.295 --> 29:35.991
Yes.

29:36.122 --> 29:36.862
She is on her way.

29:36.992 --> 29:38.037
You spoke to Andrea?

29:38.167 --> 29:39.255
And she-- she's OK?

29:39.386 --> 29:42.389
Well, she's
concerned, naturally.

29:42.519 --> 29:47.394
But I told her you're
lucky to be alive.

29:47.524 --> 29:48.743
LESLIE: I'm so sorry, Adam.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.049
This must be
overwhelming for you.

29:50.179 --> 29:52.529
And if you want anyone
to talk to, I'm--

29:52.660 --> 29:55.358
I just want to see my family.

29:55.489 --> 29:56.229
Can you give us a moment?

30:04.454 --> 30:06.805
Hm.

30:06.935 --> 30:08.981
You know, Adam, this has gotto be very difficult for you.

30:09.111 --> 30:14.073
But you have to keep in mind,you're very fortunate to have

30:14.203 --> 30:16.815
any vision at all.

30:16.945 --> 30:18.207
Easy for you to say.

30:18.338 --> 30:19.426
Hm.

30:19.556 --> 30:20.775
Yeah.

30:20.906 --> 30:22.429
Yeah.

30:22.559 --> 30:23.299
Easier than most.

30:26.259 --> 30:26.912
Well, I'm sorry.

30:27.042 --> 30:27.782
I didn't know.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.349
Nah, that's all right.

30:29.479 --> 30:33.092
You know, my ownrelationship to gratitude

30:33.222 --> 30:36.617
was not immediate, believe me.

30:36.747 --> 30:37.705
How did you lose yours?

30:37.836 --> 30:42.449
A growth in the wrong spot.

30:42.579 --> 30:45.582
The lights dimmed and died.

30:45.713 --> 30:49.717
And then nothing.

30:49.848 --> 30:50.936
Not even black.

30:51.066 --> 30:53.416
Right?

30:53.547 --> 30:59.031
You know, most people don't haveany concept of sense blindness.

30:59.161 --> 31:01.250
After 20 years of this, I--

31:01.381 --> 31:06.952
I still can't wrap my mindaround total absence of vision.

31:07.082 --> 31:10.781
An abyss you can't stare into.

31:13.523 --> 31:17.658
It sounds like a nightmare.

31:17.788 --> 31:22.141
Well, I'm not so sure.

31:22.271 --> 31:26.928
You know, the mind can
adapt to new realities--

31:27.059 --> 31:28.016
if you're willing
to pay the toll.

31:49.820 --> 31:50.256
No.

31:58.873 --> 31:59.830
DOCTOR: Is this
light OK for you?

32:08.709 --> 32:09.188
Wait.

32:12.234 --> 32:12.887
Wait.

32:13.018 --> 32:13.583
He's fighting it.

32:13.714 --> 32:14.367
ADAM: I can see.

32:14.497 --> 32:15.281
Hey, hey, hey.

32:15.411 --> 32:18.197
You need to relax, Adam.

32:18.327 --> 32:18.980
Adam!

32:19.111 --> 32:19.633
Adam.

32:19.763 --> 32:20.199
Adam.

32:20.329 --> 32:21.113
Relax.

32:21.243 --> 32:21.722
Hold-- hold his head.

32:21.852 --> 32:22.549
Hold his--

32:28.207 --> 32:30.557
Very still for me.

32:30.687 --> 32:31.819
Very still.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.300
Very still.

32:38.695 --> 32:39.131
Stop!

32:49.576 --> 32:50.969
JILL: Did you get
everything you needed?

32:51.099 --> 32:52.144
SARAH: Yeah.

32:52.274 --> 32:52.840
Everything is so
much cheaper here.

32:52.971 --> 32:53.275
Yeah, I know.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.281
So, OK, let's plan.

32:59.412 --> 33:00.891
I think that you should
take the weekend.

33:01.022 --> 33:01.936
It's two days.

33:02.067 --> 33:03.807
That's $2,000 I can't afford.

33:03.938 --> 33:04.939
What did I say
about the money?

33:05.070 --> 33:06.375
Don't worry about it.

33:06.506 --> 33:08.334
Yeah, but Jill, it's
also a 13-hour flight.

33:22.435 --> 33:25.394
Well, Have you asked?

33:25.525 --> 33:26.308
Sarah?

33:26.439 --> 33:28.571
No.

33:28.702 --> 33:30.312
I want to keep this job.

33:30.443 --> 33:34.490
You know what, as your sister,I really think you shouldn't.

33:34.621 --> 33:37.102
There is no future
in teaching English

33:37.232 --> 33:38.538
in this foreign country.

33:38.668 --> 33:41.019
Don't be an asshole.

33:41.149 --> 33:43.891
Plus, it's really
my choice, isn't it?

33:44.022 --> 33:46.807
Look, I'm just worriedabout you because I care.

33:46.937 --> 33:47.808
OK?

33:47.938 --> 33:48.548
I love you.

33:48.678 --> 33:50.332
And Mom's worried.

33:50.463 --> 33:52.030
Everyone back home is worried.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.032
And she really thinks you'rehaving a nervous breakdown.

33:55.033 --> 33:55.729
I am having a nervous--

33:59.733 --> 34:01.126
What was he saying?

34:01.256 --> 34:04.390
Something about a door?

34:04.520 --> 34:07.610
Anyways, me and
Mom would prefer it

34:07.741 --> 34:09.743
if you were to have
this nervous breakdown

34:09.873 --> 34:11.614
somewhere where we can see you.

34:11.745 --> 34:13.355
So you can feel
better about yourself?

34:13.486 --> 34:16.358
What is up with this
passive aggressiveness?

34:16.489 --> 34:21.059
Look, I know you're goingthrough a hard time, OK?

34:21.189 --> 34:22.625
We all know that.

34:22.756 --> 34:23.583
But we're here for you.

34:23.713 --> 34:24.323
I'm here for you.

34:24.453 --> 34:25.759
OK?

34:25.889 --> 34:27.587
We're trying everything
that we can, Sarah.

34:27.717 --> 34:30.155
Well, then, stop, Jill.

34:30.285 --> 34:32.679
I don't need this.

34:32.809 --> 34:35.551
I mean, I can't walk wheneveryone tries to carry

34:35.682 --> 34:36.683
me all the freaking time.

34:39.555 --> 34:40.991
Shit takes time.

34:41.122 --> 34:43.603
OK?

34:43.733 --> 34:47.650
But you don't get that, do you?

34:47.781 --> 34:49.087
Of course you don't.

34:49.217 --> 34:50.523
You're Jill.

34:50.653 --> 34:53.700
You just have to have
everything right now.

34:53.830 --> 34:56.006
I'm pregnant.

34:56.137 --> 34:56.572
OK?

35:04.493 --> 35:06.234
Of course you are.

35:06.365 --> 35:08.497
Look, you know how Mom is.

35:08.628 --> 35:09.890
I have to have this wedding now.

35:13.894 --> 35:15.113
You're going to be an aunt.

35:19.769 --> 35:23.077
I don't want to
be an aunt, OK?

35:23.208 --> 35:25.862
I'm sick and tired ofgetting the consolation prize

35:25.993 --> 35:27.212
each and every fucking time.

35:27.342 --> 35:27.908
You know what?

35:28.038 --> 35:29.214
Fuck you, Sarah.

35:29.344 --> 35:30.780
No, don't walk away.

35:30.911 --> 35:33.348
OK, this is how you respondto me every single time.

35:33.479 --> 35:35.133
This is how you tell me?

35:35.263 --> 35:38.875
How the fuck-- how the fuck amI supposed to tell you anything

35:39.006 --> 35:42.879
if you just walk the fuck away?

35:43.010 --> 35:44.316
It's not fair.

35:50.278 --> 35:51.323
You're starting a family.

35:56.458 --> 35:59.809
I just lost mine.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.246
I know that.

36:05.337 --> 36:06.555
I lost my baby.

36:06.686 --> 36:08.078
I'm sorry.

36:08.209 --> 36:09.515
I'm sorry, Sarah.

36:09.645 --> 36:10.646
I'm-- I'm sorry, Sarah.

36:10.777 --> 36:11.256
No!

36:21.179 --> 36:23.529
What the fuck's happening?

36:23.659 --> 36:26.923
What's going on?

36:27.054 --> 36:27.489
Jill?

36:32.146 --> 36:33.887
what's going on?

36:34.017 --> 36:34.801
Jill?

36:34.931 --> 36:35.802
JILL: Can you hear that?

36:35.932 --> 36:36.759
Can you hear that, Sarah?

36:36.890 --> 36:37.543
Jill.

36:37.673 --> 36:38.326
Jill.
- No!

36:38.457 --> 36:38.979
Jill.

36:39.980 --> 36:40.763
Jill.

36:40.894 --> 36:42.243
Jill.

36:42.374 --> 36:43.897
Jill, listen, I'm sorry
if I made you mad, but--

36:44.027 --> 36:44.854
It's not me.

36:57.693 --> 36:58.216
Jill.

37:07.094 --> 37:07.529
Jill?

37:11.272 --> 37:13.013
Jill?

37:13.143 --> 37:13.883
Shit.

37:14.014 --> 37:15.494
What's happening, Jill?

37:15.624 --> 37:17.539
Jill?

37:17.670 --> 37:18.192
Jill?

37:21.151 --> 37:25.068
Look, I said I was sorry, Jill.

37:25.199 --> 37:26.461
Jill, listen, I
said I was sorry.

37:26.592 --> 37:30.857
But where are you?

37:30.987 --> 37:31.814
JILL: It's all right.

37:34.904 --> 37:37.298
Sarah.

37:37.429 --> 37:38.256
SARAH: Jill?

37:38.386 --> 37:38.821
Follow me.

37:42.869 --> 37:43.609
You're freaking me out.

37:43.739 --> 37:44.218
Just--

37:57.449 --> 37:59.625
Jill.

37:59.755 --> 38:00.278
Jill.

38:03.237 --> 38:03.672
Jill.

38:07.546 --> 38:07.981
Jill.

38:20.385 --> 38:20.820
Jill?

38:50.197 --> 38:51.154
Can you hear it, Sarah?

38:54.462 --> 38:55.463
It's calling us.

39:01.034 --> 39:05.038
It's everything that you want.

39:40.334 --> 39:41.074
Where did he go?

39:58.700 --> 39:59.135
Hey!

40:02.487 --> 40:03.357
Jill!
What are you doing?

40:03.488 --> 40:04.097
Jill, stop.

40:04.227 --> 40:04.793
Jill, no.

40:08.971 --> 40:09.842
Oh!

40:09.972 --> 40:11.278
Fuck you!

40:11.409 --> 40:12.235
Oh, shit.

40:12.366 --> 40:13.193
I'm sorry.

40:13.323 --> 40:14.020
Oh!

40:14.150 --> 40:14.716
Fuck.

40:14.847 --> 40:15.630
Are you OK?

40:15.761 --> 40:16.501
I'm bleeding.
Fuck!

40:17.806 --> 40:18.546
OK, but we've
got to go now, OK?

40:18.677 --> 40:21.157
We've got to go.

40:21.288 --> 40:23.551
JILL: What the
fuck is happening?

40:30.036 --> 40:30.515
SARAH: No!

41:07.029 --> 41:09.554
Going-- going down and we'regoing to get the fucking car.

41:09.684 --> 41:10.859
What the fuck, Sarah?

41:10.990 --> 41:11.469
Sh.

41:19.389 --> 41:20.042
Jill!

41:20.173 --> 41:21.043
Jill.

41:21.174 --> 41:21.740
Jill, let's go.

41:21.870 --> 41:22.262
Don't look!

41:25.613 --> 41:26.309
OK.

41:26.440 --> 41:27.572
You need to fuck--

42:41.733 --> 42:43.082
We've got to find the car.

44:26.402 --> 44:27.273
Sh.
Sh.

44:27.403 --> 44:28.274
Sh.
Sh.

44:28.404 --> 44:29.014
Jill.
Jill.

44:29.144 --> 44:29.623
Jill.

44:29.754 --> 44:30.276
Jill.

44:30.406 --> 44:31.146
Jill, Jill.

44:31.277 --> 44:32.713
I need you with me.

44:32.844 --> 44:33.932
OK?

44:34.062 --> 44:35.890
Jill.

44:36.021 --> 44:37.196
We've got to find the car.

44:37.326 --> 44:37.805
OK?

44:46.901 --> 44:48.598
Jill, Jill, Jill,
Jill, we have to.

44:48.729 --> 44:49.295
I can't.

44:49.425 --> 44:50.165
We have to go.

44:50.296 --> 44:50.644
I can't.
I can't.

44:50.775 --> 44:51.340
Sh.

44:51.471 --> 44:51.906
Jill, please.

44:52.037 --> 44:54.692
OK?

44:54.822 --> 44:55.954
Sarah.

44:56.084 --> 44:56.563
Sarah.

45:00.175 --> 45:03.048
The door wants you.

45:03.178 --> 45:04.527
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

45:04.658 --> 45:05.572
The door wants you.

45:05.703 --> 45:06.834
No, no, no, no, no.
Jill.

45:06.965 --> 45:07.356
And it's going to
give me something.

45:08.923 --> 45:11.230
Fuck, Sarah.

45:11.360 --> 45:13.101
I'm doing this so
we can go home, OK?

45:14.712 --> 45:16.104
You're going to stay here.

45:16.235 --> 45:17.366
No, don't leave me, Sarah.

45:17.497 --> 45:18.106
- Please don't leave me.

45:18.237 --> 45:18.716
Please.
- Jill.

45:18.846 --> 45:19.412
Jill.

45:19.542 --> 45:20.282
I'll be back.

45:20.413 --> 45:22.197
OK?

45:22.328 --> 45:23.111
Jill?

45:23.242 --> 45:24.112
Jill?

45:24.243 --> 45:25.984
I'll be back.

45:26.114 --> 45:27.376
I'll be back.

45:27.507 --> 45:29.248
OK?

45:29.378 --> 45:31.816
Sarah, come back.

47:41.989 --> 47:43.382
Jill.

47:43.512 --> 47:45.427
Jill, Jill, .

47:45.558 --> 47:46.689
Sarah.

47:46.820 --> 47:48.256
Get me out of here.

47:48.387 --> 47:49.257
Here, we're going to go home.

47:49.388 --> 47:50.302
OK?

47:50.432 --> 47:52.434
OK.

48:19.722 --> 48:20.158
Sarah.

48:20.288 --> 48:21.202
Sarah.

48:37.392 --> 48:37.915
Kill him.

48:38.045 --> 48:39.177
Kill him.

48:39.307 --> 48:40.134
Kill him.

48:53.452 --> 48:53.843
We lost them.
I think we're good.

48:53.974 --> 48:54.496
OK.

48:54.627 --> 48:56.759
Just drive.

48:56.890 --> 48:58.022
We need to go up the stairs.

48:58.152 --> 48:59.762
The exit's on the
right hand, Sarah.

48:59.893 --> 49:01.677
MAN : --now comingin, this blackout is worldwide.

49:01.808 --> 49:02.504
JILL: The right, Sarah.

49:02.635 --> 49:03.244
On the right.

49:03.375 --> 49:03.853
SARAH: OK, OK!

49:03.984 --> 49:04.680
I'm going.

49:06.160 --> 49:06.987
MAN : Repeat,
do not go outside.

49:09.250 --> 49:10.556
SARAH: OK, Jill!

49:10.686 --> 49:11.861
What's wrong?

49:11.992 --> 49:12.862
JILL : Just drive.

49:18.868 --> 49:20.566
Turn left, Sarah.

49:20.696 --> 49:21.262
What?

49:21.393 --> 49:22.350
Turn left.

49:22.481 --> 49:24.135
No, the exit is
straight ahead.

49:24.265 --> 49:24.700
Turn left.

49:24.831 --> 49:25.484
No!

49:25.614 --> 49:26.528
Turn left, Sarah.

49:26.659 --> 49:27.442
- No, Jill.
- Turn left!

49:27.573 --> 49:28.487
Jill, no.

49:28.617 --> 49:29.967
The exit is straight ahead.

49:30.097 --> 49:30.968
Jill!

49:31.098 --> 49:31.881
No.

49:32.012 --> 49:32.665
Jill!

49:51.597 --> 49:52.685
We're ready, Sarah.

51:05.714 --> 51:06.193
Jill!

51:08.674 --> 51:09.153
Jill!

52:14.087 --> 52:14.522
No!

53:05.486 --> 53:05.921
Jill?

53:32.121 --> 53:35.299
Is this even real?

53:35.429 --> 53:36.300
Does it even matter?

53:42.088 --> 53:45.613
Are you-- is Jill OK?

54:18.603 --> 54:19.081
Sh.

54:22.084 --> 54:22.520
Sh.

55:39.118 --> 55:39.901
How are you feeling, Adam?

55:43.514 --> 55:44.863
You sleeping all right?

55:49.041 --> 55:50.738
Any more lucid
dreams or nightmares?

55:50.869 --> 55:53.741
It felt real to me, OK?

55:53.872 --> 55:55.526
I could see out of both eyes.

55:55.656 --> 55:56.527
And then--

55:56.657 --> 55:58.877
Adam, we've been over this.

55:59.007 --> 56:01.488
The operation was
a complete success.

56:01.619 --> 56:03.142
No complications, and
so far, no setbacks.

56:03.272 --> 56:03.751
OK?

56:08.582 --> 56:10.976
How are you
adjusting sight-wise?

56:14.327 --> 56:15.241
I'm still getting used to it.

56:21.029 --> 56:24.598
Dr. Markonen told me to passon that your wife called again.

56:24.729 --> 56:29.081
She apologized for the delayand said she'll be here soon.

56:29.211 --> 56:31.344
ADAM : They'relying to you, of course.

56:31.475 --> 56:34.869
You know, it's
OK to feel anxious.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.218
About seeing your wife.

56:36.349 --> 56:37.698
ADAM : They
think you're weak.

56:37.829 --> 56:40.179
LESLIE: You've just
had major surgery.

56:40.309 --> 56:44.052
It's a big adjustment
for everyone.

56:44.183 --> 56:49.797
With a loss of health, it's notuncommon to feel a betrayal.

56:49.928 --> 56:52.800
ADAM : Too
weak to know the truth.

56:52.931 --> 56:54.411
LESLIE: That your own bodyis turning against you.

56:57.805 --> 57:01.200
It's not unusual to feel--

57:01.330 --> 57:03.855
well, that you're
not really whole.

57:03.985 --> 57:05.030
That there's something missing.

57:05.160 --> 57:06.335
Oh, there's
something missing--

57:06.466 --> 57:07.511
doctor.

57:07.641 --> 57:11.123
That's for sure-- my daughter.

57:11.253 --> 57:13.125
My wife.

57:13.255 --> 57:15.214
My sight.

57:15.344 --> 57:18.435
ADAM : But Iknow you're ready to see.

57:18.565 --> 57:21.481
ADAM: How long is
this going to go on?

57:21.612 --> 57:23.744
Did Markonen feed you
that bit about betrayal?

57:23.875 --> 57:25.790
It seems like something
you'd have to experience

57:25.920 --> 57:27.313
in order to articulate.

57:30.098 --> 57:30.969
ADAM : Through me.

57:36.627 --> 57:39.368
Why can't I see my family?

57:39.499 --> 57:40.282
Let go of the door, Adam.

57:40.413 --> 57:41.849
Why can't I see them?

57:41.980 --> 57:42.676
Let go now!

57:59.345 --> 58:01.086
What the fuck?

58:01.216 --> 58:01.695
What?

58:05.307 --> 58:06.526
Can you see me, Adam?

58:10.878 --> 58:12.358
Adam.

58:12.489 --> 58:13.968
Uh, your bandages.

58:14.099 --> 58:15.100
Um, y-- yeah.

58:15.230 --> 58:17.102
I-- I had-- had an itch.

58:17.232 --> 58:18.669
Well, you should
have waited for me.

58:18.799 --> 58:20.584
Well, my patience iswearing a little thin, doc.

58:20.714 --> 58:23.891
But we-- we don't
want it to get infected.

58:24.022 --> 58:26.328
Is that why it
looks like this?

58:26.459 --> 58:27.504
No.

58:27.634 --> 58:30.550
Uh, this is the
latest prosthetic.

58:30.681 --> 58:32.117
And, uh, I know it
takes a little getting

58:32.247 --> 58:33.727
used to, but I promise it's--

58:33.858 --> 58:35.599
it's helping the surroundingtissues heal fas--

58:35.729 --> 58:37.165
It doesn't feel
like a prosthetic.

58:37.296 --> 58:40.473
Will you please
let me look at it?

58:40.604 --> 58:42.606
You don't want to
wait for Dr. Leslie?

58:42.736 --> 58:43.781
No.

58:43.911 --> 58:47.088
Um, I sent her home.

58:47.219 --> 58:50.004
She hasn't been
feeling well lately.

58:50.135 --> 58:50.657
Welcome to the club.

58:54.269 --> 58:56.620
MARKONEN: OK.

58:56.750 --> 58:59.884
Here we go.

59:00.014 --> 59:00.493
OK.

59:03.540 --> 59:07.369
Now the hard part.

59:07.500 --> 59:10.590
ADAM : I
know what you want.

59:10.721 --> 59:11.591
Easy.

59:11.722 --> 59:13.462
D-- did you hear that?

59:13.593 --> 59:15.203
What?

59:15.334 --> 59:15.987
ADAM : I'll takeyou to your wife and daughter.

59:19.294 --> 59:22.602
I know this is veryuncomfortable for you, Adam.

59:22.733 --> 59:25.518
But it's also very important.

59:25.649 --> 59:26.563
Can you please try to relax?

59:33.091 --> 59:36.007
ADAM : An
eye for an eye, Adam.

59:36.137 --> 59:37.225
Very still.

59:37.356 --> 59:38.183
Still, now.

59:38.313 --> 59:39.227
Easy.

59:39.358 --> 59:41.882
Very still, now.

59:42.013 --> 59:44.755
ADAM : Youknow what you have to do.

59:44.885 --> 59:45.886
Easy.

59:46.017 --> 59:46.844
Easy.

59:46.974 --> 59:47.801
How much longer?

59:47.932 --> 59:49.629
Uh, just, uh-- just--

59:49.760 --> 59:50.630
just a moment, please.

59:50.761 --> 59:51.500
It burns.

59:51.631 --> 59:52.153
ADAM : Do it.

59:52.284 --> 59:53.459
Yeah, yeah.

59:53.590 --> 59:54.373
Just take a breath.

59:54.503 --> 59:55.330
Take a breath.

59:55.461 --> 59:56.244
Wow.

59:56.375 --> 59:58.159
ADAM : Do it!

59:58.290 --> 59:59.334
I need a break!

59:59.465 --> 59:59.900
MARKONEN: No.

1:00:00.031 --> 1:00:00.509
Wait!

1:00:00.640 --> 1:00:01.510
I can't.

1:00:01.641 --> 1:00:03.251
Yes, you can, Adam.

1:00:03.382 --> 1:00:04.557
Yes, you can.

1:00:04.688 --> 1:00:06.733
Oh, you are lucky to be alive.

1:00:06.864 --> 1:00:07.734
ADAM : Pay the toll!

1:00:07.865 --> 1:00:08.474
Whoa.

1:00:08.605 --> 1:00:09.301
Whoa.
Adam.

1:00:09.431 --> 1:00:10.215
Adam.
Calm down.

1:00:10.345 --> 1:00:11.346
Calm down.

1:00:11.477 --> 1:00:11.999
You did this to
me, didn't you?

1:00:12.130 --> 1:00:12.826
No.
No.

1:00:12.957 --> 1:00:13.522
I'm sorry.

1:00:13.653 --> 1:00:15.742
I had to see it.

1:00:15.873 --> 1:00:17.135
Who the fuck are you?

1:00:17.265 --> 1:00:18.876
Adam, if you just give me a--

1:00:37.938 --> 1:00:39.244
Mother fucker!

1:00:52.387 --> 1:00:53.954
You know, you've
been given a gift.

1:00:56.696 --> 1:01:00.961
Insights into realitieswe can't even conceive of.

1:01:01.092 --> 1:01:02.833
And what do you do, huh?

1:01:02.963 --> 1:01:03.529
What do you do?

1:01:06.488 --> 1:01:09.578
You succumb to blind rage?

1:01:09.709 --> 1:01:10.275
No.

1:01:10.405 --> 1:01:10.841
No.

1:01:14.453 --> 1:01:17.282
Sorry, Adam.

1:01:17.412 --> 1:01:20.546
You don't deserve it.

1:01:20.677 --> 1:01:21.416
No!

1:01:21.547 --> 1:01:22.026
No!

1:01:22.156 --> 1:01:23.418
No!

1:01:23.549 --> 1:01:24.245
No!

1:01:31.035 --> 1:01:31.688
Don't shoot.
- No, no, no.

1:01:31.818 --> 1:01:32.384
I had to stop him.

1:01:32.514 --> 1:01:33.385
Don't shoot.

1:01:33.515 --> 1:01:33.646
He was going to kill you.

1:01:37.041 --> 1:01:39.347
What do you want from me?

1:01:39.478 --> 1:01:41.436
Adam, please.

1:01:41.567 --> 1:01:44.918
I just want to help.

1:01:45.049 --> 1:01:46.615
Your wife-- she hasn't called.

1:01:46.746 --> 1:01:47.529
She's on the other side.

1:01:47.660 --> 1:01:49.618
Almost everyone is.

1:01:49.749 --> 1:01:50.445
My family, too.

1:01:50.576 --> 1:01:51.577
Other side of what?

1:01:51.708 --> 1:01:55.102
The thing you crashed into.

1:01:55.233 --> 1:01:57.235
We think it's some kind
of doorway or portal.

1:01:57.365 --> 1:01:58.062
Portal to where?

1:01:58.192 --> 1:01:59.541
Where are they?

1:01:59.672 --> 1:02:01.413
We were hoping
you could tell us.

1:02:01.543 --> 1:02:02.762
Me?

1:02:02.893 --> 1:02:04.198
You passed through, Adam.

1:02:04.329 --> 1:02:06.723
And somehow, you made it back--

1:02:06.853 --> 1:02:07.811
with that.

1:02:07.941 --> 1:02:10.596
This?

1:02:10.727 --> 1:02:13.599
But he said that
this is a prosthesis.

1:02:13.730 --> 1:02:16.820
He tried cutting it out
and it started changing,

1:02:16.950 --> 1:02:18.691
and I stopped him.

1:02:18.822 --> 1:02:20.388
He became obsessed,
insisting it was

1:02:20.519 --> 1:02:23.783
some link to the other
side, like a window or--

1:02:23.914 --> 1:02:24.610
Or a mirror.

1:02:28.179 --> 1:02:28.962
Tell me everything you know.

1:02:31.835 --> 1:02:33.140
Follow me.

1:02:33.271 --> 1:02:35.664
Some are convincedthey're extraterrestrial,

1:02:35.795 --> 1:02:38.493
even interdimensional beings.

1:02:38.624 --> 1:02:40.234
Others tend to
get more biblical.

1:02:40.365 --> 1:02:41.627
What do you think?

1:02:41.758 --> 1:02:43.063
There's anintelligence behind them.

1:02:43.194 --> 1:02:44.064
That's all we know for sure.

1:02:46.893 --> 1:02:48.460
And they're not to
be underestimated.

1:02:56.947 --> 1:02:59.297
What is this place?

1:02:59.427 --> 1:03:03.562
We're a VA hospital withsome additional services.

1:03:03.692 --> 1:03:06.130
You mean like a military base?

1:03:06.260 --> 1:03:08.393
Used to be, anyway.

1:03:08.523 --> 1:03:08.959
Ah!

1:03:11.700 --> 1:03:13.180
Keep your eye closed.

1:03:13.311 --> 1:03:15.139
It's only going to
get worse from here.

1:03:30.328 --> 1:03:32.069
Lost a lot of lives
bringing it here.

1:03:32.199 --> 1:03:32.983
Markonen insisted.

1:03:42.862 --> 1:03:44.603
We discovered that
it emits a form

1:03:44.733 --> 1:03:47.432
of high-frequency radiation.

1:03:47.562 --> 1:03:48.607
So we tried
communicating with it.

1:03:50.391 --> 1:03:52.480
What did it say?

1:03:52.611 --> 1:03:55.005
I think it says somethingdifferent for each of us.

1:03:55.135 --> 1:03:57.181
For Markonen, it promisedanswers, insight.

1:04:01.011 --> 1:04:03.056
And then you showed
up with that eye.

1:04:03.187 --> 1:04:04.536
What did it promise you?

1:04:08.627 --> 1:04:11.021
My wife.

1:04:11.151 --> 1:04:11.978
In exchange for what?

1:04:15.677 --> 1:04:16.896
For me?

1:04:17.027 --> 1:04:19.377
Maybe you can save
both our families.

1:04:19.507 --> 1:04:22.641
You're the only one who's beento the other side and back.

1:04:22.771 --> 1:04:24.208
Well, it wasn't free, was it?

1:04:27.124 --> 1:04:30.605
That's a risk I'm
willing to take.

1:04:30.736 --> 1:04:31.171
Are you?

1:04:45.751 --> 1:04:46.621
Good luck.

1:05:05.205 --> 1:05:06.554
How long does this take?

1:05:31.101 --> 1:05:32.972
Oh!

1:05:47.900 --> 1:05:48.379
Oh, no.

1:05:48.509 --> 1:05:49.293
No, no.

1:05:49.423 --> 1:05:51.860
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1:05:51.991 --> 1:05:52.861
Gah!

1:05:52.992 --> 1:05:56.953
Son of a bitch!

1:05:57.083 --> 1:05:57.562
Fuck!

1:06:09.226 --> 1:06:09.966
Fuck it.

1:07:31.134 --> 1:07:32.874
Gah!

1:07:33.005 --> 1:07:33.440
Ow!

1:07:58.639 --> 1:07:59.510
What the fuck?

1:08:17.963 --> 1:08:20.835
Ah!

1:08:20.966 --> 1:08:23.751
CHILD'S VOICE : Daddy!

1:08:23.882 --> 1:08:25.362
Honey?

1:08:25.492 --> 1:08:25.927
Honey!

1:08:42.944 --> 1:08:44.032
Andrea?

1:08:44.163 --> 1:08:46.513
That was my mother's name.

1:08:49.125 --> 1:08:49.951
Who are you?

1:08:53.041 --> 1:08:53.912
Kate?

1:08:54.042 --> 1:08:56.697
How do you know my name?

1:08:56.828 --> 1:08:57.263
No.

1:09:00.745 --> 1:09:02.399
It's-- it's your dad.

1:09:02.529 --> 1:09:03.835
Kate, no!

1:09:03.965 --> 1:09:04.836
Please, no.

1:09:04.966 --> 1:09:05.576
Kate, I have to ask you--

1:09:12.670 --> 1:09:13.497
ADAM 2: Have a seat, Adam.

1:09:19.546 --> 1:09:22.332
Is this some kind of a joke?

1:09:22.462 --> 1:09:24.203
It's funny to you, too.

1:09:26.292 --> 1:09:27.119
Sit down.

1:09:39.349 --> 1:09:40.959
What did you do
to my daughter?

1:09:41.089 --> 1:09:42.265
Nothing.

1:09:42.395 --> 1:09:44.223
But neither did you.

1:09:44.354 --> 1:09:45.920
And look at her--

1:09:46.051 --> 1:09:49.707
happy, healthy, well-adjusted.

1:09:49.837 --> 1:09:51.926
Almost as if she's
better off without you.

1:09:55.060 --> 1:09:56.192
Why are you doing this to me?

1:10:02.285 --> 1:10:04.200
We're well beyond that, Adam.

1:10:04.330 --> 1:10:12.556
Let's think of this as anexperiment-- or an exchange.

1:10:12.686 --> 1:10:15.298
We see the world
through your eyes,

1:10:15.428 --> 1:10:16.908
while you live
happily on our side.

1:10:20.825 --> 1:10:21.608
Andrea.

1:10:21.739 --> 1:10:23.262
Kate.

1:10:23.393 --> 1:10:25.177
Or you could leave us andlet fate take its course.

1:10:34.317 --> 1:10:39.147
It's your choice-- if you'rewilling to pay for it.

1:10:39.278 --> 1:10:43.064
These roads have a
toll, I'm afraid.

1:10:43.195 --> 1:10:45.371
What do you want from me?

1:10:45.502 --> 1:10:48.722
Stay, and give
us the other eye.

1:10:48.853 --> 1:10:52.073
Leave, and we take
back your new eye.

1:10:52.204 --> 1:10:53.771
One or the other.

1:10:53.901 --> 1:10:55.425
You can't have both.

1:10:59.429 --> 1:11:03.520
If I stay, I won't reallysee them again, will I?

1:11:03.650 --> 1:11:05.913
It w-- it won't be real.

1:11:06.044 --> 1:11:08.046
It never really was.

1:11:08.176 --> 1:11:09.134
You just didn't notice.

1:11:11.832 --> 1:11:13.965
But you would be together.

1:11:14.095 --> 1:11:16.184
Happy.

1:11:16.315 --> 1:11:18.099
Isn't that what really matters?

1:11:22.539 --> 1:11:24.976
Adam, close your eyes.

1:11:31.591 --> 1:11:33.419
And open them.

1:11:45.649 --> 1:11:47.128
Welcome home, Adam.

1:11:53.744 --> 1:11:55.049
Your family is waiting for you.

1:11:57.922 --> 1:11:58.618
See their faces.

1:12:02.883 --> 1:12:04.581
Make them safe again.

1:12:08.367 --> 1:12:10.195
Be together forever.

1:12:13.633 --> 1:12:16.810
All that's left now
is to pay the toll.

1:12:16.941 --> 1:12:20.336
An eye for an eye.

1:12:20.466 --> 1:12:21.772
You want me to pay the toll?

1:12:27.604 --> 1:12:28.256
Take them.

1:12:28.387 --> 1:12:29.214
What's he doing?

1:12:29.345 --> 1:12:30.084
No.

1:12:30.215 --> 1:12:30.781
No.

1:12:30.911 --> 1:12:32.130
We had a deal.

1:12:48.451 --> 1:12:51.018
MARKONEN : The mindcan adapt to new realities.

1:12:53.978 --> 1:12:55.762
If you're willing
to pay the toll.

1:13:01.725 --> 1:13:03.422
Honestly, considering
the accident,

1:13:03.553 --> 1:13:05.772
it's a miracle, really.

1:13:05.903 --> 1:13:07.078
He's lucky to be alive.

1:13:07.208 --> 1:13:09.602
No, doctor, thank
you for everything.

1:13:09.733 --> 1:13:12.910
We're so grateful.

1:13:13.040 --> 1:13:15.826
We removed the bandages today.

1:13:15.956 --> 1:13:19.090
Dr. Markonen felt it bestthe wounds be left to breathe

1:13:19.220 --> 1:13:21.266
and heal on their own.

1:13:21.397 --> 1:13:24.269
Are you sure she's going
to be OK with this?

1:13:24.400 --> 1:13:27.794
I just want to
see Daddy's face.

1:13:27.925 --> 1:13:28.404
Yeah.

1:13:31.842 --> 1:13:34.235
Adam.

1:13:34.366 --> 1:13:36.586
Someone's here to see you.

1:13:36.716 --> 1:13:38.152
Honey?

1:13:38.283 --> 1:13:39.502
Oh, sweetie.

1:13:39.632 --> 1:13:40.633
Oh, sweetie.

1:13:40.764 --> 1:13:41.286
Oh!

1:14:32.206 --> 1:14:33.512
JAMES: Where do I
think they're from?

1:14:36.776 --> 1:14:37.821
Hard to say, at the moment.

1:14:42.434 --> 1:14:44.175
They don't have any
masks, it seems.

1:14:46.830 --> 1:14:48.875
But they are there.

1:14:49.006 --> 1:14:50.660
And people have
interacted with them.

1:14:53.401 --> 1:14:54.881
That changes everything
we know about physics.

1:14:58.015 --> 1:15:00.365
ANNA: So many people havelost their loved ones.

1:15:00.496 --> 1:15:03.542
Everyone's been affected.

1:15:03.673 --> 1:15:08.286
But you-- you hope.

1:15:08.416 --> 1:15:11.419
JAMES: We have no
idea what they are.

1:15:11.550 --> 1:15:13.073
And I think it's goingto take a while before we

1:15:13.204 --> 1:15:17.469
have any solid understanding.

1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:21.821
But we m-- we just don't know.

1:15:25.433 --> 1:15:27.218
And that's a little terrifying.

1:15:45.192 --> 1:15:47.630
I've gone over thecalculations again and again.

1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:48.805
And I still can't guaran--

1:15:48.935 --> 1:15:50.415
ANNA: James, we both have.

1:15:50.546 --> 1:15:53.461
JAMES: If the connection
between the two portals

1:15:53.592 --> 1:15:57.640
isn't stable while we're inside,we're, for lack of a better

1:15:57.770 --> 1:16:00.207
term, completely fucked.

1:16:00.338 --> 1:16:01.295
Look, we've done the work.

1:16:01.426 --> 1:16:02.688
We've tracked the patterns.

1:16:02.819 --> 1:16:04.560
Our science is sound.

1:16:04.690 --> 1:16:07.867
Now all we need is
a bit of faith, OK?

1:16:07.998 --> 1:16:12.219
JAMES: Have a little faith.

1:16:12.350 --> 1:16:16.920
Anna, you do know this is aportal we're talking about?

1:16:17.050 --> 1:16:19.487
James, look around us.

1:16:19.618 --> 1:16:21.838
There is nothing left.

1:16:21.968 --> 1:16:22.795
We need to do this now.

1:16:29.323 --> 1:16:29.759
OK.

1:16:32.936 --> 1:16:34.024
Initiating energy burst.

1:17:10.016 --> 1:17:10.495
JAMES: Anna?

1:17:10.626 --> 1:17:11.191
I'm OK.

1:17:18.372 --> 1:17:21.201
It worked.

1:17:21.332 --> 1:17:22.072
It worked!

1:17:22.202 --> 1:17:22.942
You did it.

1:17:27.599 --> 1:17:29.557
I can't believe you're here.

1:17:29.688 --> 1:17:32.386
Like, it's actually you.

1:17:32.517 --> 1:17:33.431
Oh, god.

1:17:33.561 --> 1:17:36.216
You-- you know what this means.

1:17:36.347 --> 1:17:36.826
Phase 2.

1:17:36.956 --> 1:17:37.522
Come on.

1:17:37.653 --> 1:17:38.262
Both of us now.

1:17:38.392 --> 1:17:39.872
No.

1:17:40.003 --> 1:17:43.659
F-- absolutely not.

1:17:43.789 --> 1:17:45.791
We haven't-- we need to checkthat you're all right first.

1:17:45.922 --> 1:17:46.966
No.

1:17:47.097 --> 1:17:48.098
We're not going
to do that again.

1:17:48.228 --> 1:17:48.620
I'm not--
- I'm totally fine.

1:17:48.751 --> 1:17:49.142
Come on.

1:17:49.273 --> 1:17:50.056
Anna--

1:17:50.187 --> 1:17:51.318
The connection works.

1:17:51.449 --> 1:17:53.843
We need to try it
now, while we can.

1:17:53.973 --> 1:17:54.931
Do I need to make
another speech?

1:17:58.456 --> 1:18:00.066
Maybe.

1:18:00.197 --> 1:18:01.677
The first one seemed
to work all right.

1:18:01.807 --> 1:18:03.461
OK, come on.

1:18:03.591 --> 1:18:08.422
This is the only way we can besure if we can save the others.

1:18:08.553 --> 1:18:11.774
OK, OK.

1:18:11.904 --> 1:18:12.731
OK.

1:18:12.862 --> 1:18:14.733
But we're doing it my way.

1:18:14.864 --> 1:18:16.561
Give me some time to
make some calculations.

1:18:19.912 --> 1:18:22.741
Frequency's strong.

1:18:22.872 --> 1:18:25.178
Connection is stable.

1:18:25.309 --> 1:18:27.224
Um.

1:18:27.354 --> 1:18:29.400
The door is open.

1:18:29.530 --> 1:18:29.966
OK.

1:18:51.988 --> 1:18:53.816
I'll be right behind you, OK?

1:19:30.461 --> 1:19:30.896
Yes.

1:19:38.469 --> 1:19:39.252
Come on, Anna.

1:19:42.865 --> 1:19:43.735
Come on.

1:19:43.866 --> 1:19:44.736
Come on.

1:19:48.218 --> 1:19:48.914
Fuck.

1:19:49.045 --> 1:19:49.697
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1:19:49.828 --> 1:19:52.222
Anna, come on.

1:19:52.352 --> 1:19:53.701
Come on, come on.

1:20:01.666 --> 1:20:02.145
Anna?

1:20:39.051 --> 1:20:39.486
Anna.

1:20:42.968 --> 1:20:44.274
I've seen
what is coming, James.

1:20:49.322 --> 1:20:54.023
The portals are
just the beginning.

1:21:10.866 --> 1:21:14.870
What's coming is the end.
