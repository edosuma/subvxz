♪ ♪

00:23.893 --> 00:25.373
Hey.

00:25.416 --> 00:26.461
No.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.245
Whatever you're into,

00:28.289 --> 00:29.333
I don't care.

00:29.377 --> 00:30.813
You can't be here.

00:30.856 --> 00:33.250
Who let you in?
Nancy still has her keycard.

00:33.294 --> 00:35.078
You know, I'm so sorry, you guys,

00:35.122 --> 00:37.472
I really thought that
Connor would want our help

00:37.515 --> 00:38.951
figuring out if our murderer

00:38.995 --> 00:41.563
was a human or a
supernatural baddie.

00:41.606 --> 00:43.913
Yeah, like the supernatural entity

00:43.956 --> 00:45.523
that came after his son
last month.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.134
Yeah.

00:47.177 --> 00:48.744
And we brought bagels.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.354
Two dead guys,

00:50.398 --> 00:52.661
both with iceboxes where
their hearts used to be.

00:52.704 --> 00:55.751
One found on Nancy's car,
one found at Nancy's carnival.

00:55.794 --> 00:57.274
I vote Temperance.

00:57.318 --> 00:59.015
Obviously, she's dangerous,

00:59.059 --> 01:02.540
and the timing of her Horseshoe
Bay Homecoming is fishy,

01:02.584 --> 01:04.107
but for her to show up

01:04.151 --> 01:06.414
and then immediately
start leaving me bodies...

01:06.457 --> 01:09.547
- I feel like she'd be a little more strategic than that.
- I mean, this town

01:09.591 --> 01:11.680
is infested with all kinds
of supernatural menaces.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.334
We shouldn't rule anything out.

01:13.377 --> 01:15.118
There's also a chance
the killer could be

01:15.162 --> 01:16.598
of the human variety.

01:16.641 --> 01:18.295
Yeah. Serial killers have been known

01:18.339 --> 01:20.341
to put body parts in freezers.

01:20.384 --> 01:22.299
Okay, I got to get to the station.

01:22.343 --> 01:25.041
Bess, George, why don't you guys
look into if there's been

01:25.085 --> 01:27.348
a history of supernatural
freezings in Horseshoe Bay.

01:27.391 --> 01:29.132
Nick, Ace, watch the autopsy,

01:29.176 --> 01:31.395
follow the human
serial killer angle.

01:31.439 --> 01:32.875
I work alone.

01:33.876 --> 01:34.964
Honey,

01:35.007 --> 01:37.097
we saved your son from a lamia.

01:43.015 --> 01:45.366
Hi.
Hi.

01:45.409 --> 01:47.498
I brought some bagels.

01:47.542 --> 01:50.066
Well, thank you, but...

01:50.110 --> 01:53.330
I would love it if you
laid low for a minute.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.332
There's a serial killer
out there

01:55.376 --> 01:58.422
who has some kind
of twisted fascination with you,

01:58.466 --> 01:59.815
so forgive me
for being cautious.

01:59.858 --> 02:01.295
I'm gonna be at
the police station,

02:01.338 --> 02:03.340
starting my duties
as community liaison.

02:03.384 --> 02:04.907
Kind of the safest gig in town.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.865
A-Aren't they still
holding your car as evidence?

02:06.909 --> 02:09.259
Yes. But no one has
impounded my feet yet.

02:09.303 --> 02:10.652
I'm walking.

02:10.695 --> 02:11.870
Nancy.

02:11.914 --> 02:13.176
Or you can drive me.

02:13.220 --> 02:14.569
Okay?
Be right back.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.400
You know, when I was growing up,

02:19.443 --> 02:21.793
the tighter my parents
tried to grasp onto me,

02:21.837 --> 02:24.274
the harder I tried
to slip through their fingers.

02:25.275 --> 02:27.277
I think I know how
to parent Nancy.

02:27.321 --> 02:29.975
Sure you do...
that's why there's bagels.

02:30.019 --> 02:32.543
I used to pull this trick
all the time

02:32.587 --> 02:33.849
when I partied all night.

02:33.892 --> 02:36.591
Bagel doesn't
fall far from the tree.

02:37.896 --> 02:39.463
Hi, Joyce.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.030
It's my first day
as community liaison.

02:41.073 --> 02:42.858
Can you please
escort me to my office?

02:42.901 --> 02:44.990
Uh, we set it up
for you. It's...

02:49.908 --> 02:53.347
Does the community liaison
not get a chair?

02:56.437 --> 02:57.829
Don't worry.
I'm gonna make...

02:57.873 --> 03:00.136
I'm gonna make one.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.880
Matthew Burke,
from the corn maze.

03:04.923 --> 03:08.449
His chest cavity was
frozen solid and scooped clean.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.799
Not a trace of his
heart remains.

03:10.842 --> 03:14.194
Dustin Yates' cavity is...

03:14.237 --> 03:16.065
messy, burnt.

03:16.108 --> 03:18.720
Little bits of frozen heart
tissue hanging in place

03:18.763 --> 03:21.418
like, uh, tiny streamers

03:21.462 --> 03:23.203
the day after
a New Year's party.

03:25.683 --> 03:27.250
Well, if the first kill
was clean,

03:27.294 --> 03:29.121
why would the second one
be sloppy?

03:29.165 --> 03:30.906
The killer is experimenting?

03:30.949 --> 03:33.300
Or becoming more erratic,
possibly more violent.

03:33.343 --> 03:34.736
If we can figure out

03:34.779 --> 03:36.694
what the killer used
to freeze Dustin's heart,

03:36.738 --> 03:40.045
maybe we can track them
using recent purchases.

03:40.089 --> 03:42.265
Sounds like an excellent
new hobby for you.

03:42.309 --> 03:45.355
Yeah, do that far from here.

03:56.148 --> 03:58.107
It's like the sparkles
are dancing.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.804
Okay, it is a rock

03:59.848 --> 04:02.024
and piece of metal that
in no way defines my worth.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.721
All right?

04:03.765 --> 04:05.201
I mean,

04:05.245 --> 04:07.203
obviously I love it.
Mm.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.423
I just don't want them
to mistake jewelry for identity.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.033
Oh, yeah, I know, I know.

04:11.076 --> 04:13.427
But this piece of rock and metal

04:13.470 --> 04:17.169
looks damn good on your finger.

04:18.997 --> 04:20.825
I need you to forge

04:20.869 --> 04:23.001
Victoria's signature again
for school.

04:27.049 --> 04:28.529
Behavioral issues?

04:29.530 --> 04:31.445
No, no, no, Charlie,
I'm not signing this

04:31.488 --> 04:34.056
until you tell me
what's going on.

04:35.318 --> 04:37.146
Yeah. Did you see
the new BTS clip?

04:37.189 --> 04:40.062
- Oh, my God, look at that.
- Are you kidding me?

05:14.749 --> 05:17.229
Um, nothing about frozen hearts.

05:17.273 --> 05:19.493
When does Hannah get back
from her research trip?

05:19.536 --> 05:21.364
She said it was open-ended,

05:21.408 --> 05:23.279
which is why she's letting me
mind the historical society

05:23.323 --> 05:25.368
while she's away.
Yeah, I...

05:25.412 --> 05:27.370
haven't found anything
on hearts, either.

05:27.414 --> 05:30.591
But there is all this stuff
about my ancestor Martha Marvin.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.462
She was an original
Woman in White,

05:32.506 --> 05:34.116
and she had
all these occult tools

05:34.159 --> 05:35.639
to enhance her skills. Look.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.554
It's so crazy.

05:37.598 --> 05:39.208
They were so powerful
for so long,

05:39.251 --> 05:40.340
and then they just folded.

05:40.383 --> 05:41.950
Probably for the best.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.995
They, like, totally dabbled
in anti-feminist repression.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.388
Yeah.

05:47.129 --> 05:48.913
George, where's your ring?

05:51.568 --> 05:53.570
Half of these messages
are about stray cats

05:53.614 --> 05:55.180
or property line disputes.

05:56.181 --> 05:57.661
You're sidelining me.

05:57.705 --> 05:58.880
Technically,

05:58.923 --> 06:00.447
you don't work for me.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.100
I'm just here to track
and profile the killer.

06:02.144 --> 06:04.407
I'm giving you an avenue
to be of assistance, safely.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.496
Because this killer is an
attention-seeking sadist,

06:06.540 --> 06:09.107
and their decision
to leave a body on your car

06:09.151 --> 06:11.675
indicates that they're desperate
for your attention.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.677
If you give it to them
by pursuing them openly,

06:13.721 --> 06:15.505
they will believe that you two

06:15.549 --> 06:17.899
are in a dialogue... one that
ends up with you getting hurt,

06:17.942 --> 06:20.075
or worse. All the more reason
for me to find out

06:20.118 --> 06:21.511
who they are and stop them.

06:23.513 --> 06:26.777
Hi. I was told to come here
if I had tips

06:26.821 --> 06:28.649
about the recent murders.

06:28.692 --> 06:29.998
Temperance.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.435
Oh, you already know

06:32.479 --> 06:33.697
the community
liaison. Nancy...

06:33.741 --> 06:35.264
could you handle?

06:35.307 --> 06:37.266
Mm.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.530
Okay, I work here now,
so I don't have time

06:40.574 --> 06:42.967
for tarot card readings
or blood-bathing rituals,

06:43.011 --> 06:45.448
and I highly doubt
you have an actual tip.

06:45.492 --> 06:46.971
You're right.

06:47.015 --> 06:48.625
It's better than a tip.

06:48.669 --> 06:50.845
I have a way to solve
these murders.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.720
♪ ♪

07:10.430 --> 07:12.257
So, what's in it for you?

07:12.301 --> 07:14.695
This was my town
long before it was yours.

07:14.738 --> 07:18.307
I want peace returned
just as much as you.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.309
And with innocents dying
and a threatening man

07:20.352 --> 07:22.311
coming into my home
trying to hurt you,

07:22.354 --> 07:25.009
I feel compelled to step in.
You know, your rescue the other night

07:25.053 --> 07:26.881
was impeccably timed...
it was almost like you knew

07:26.924 --> 07:28.796
I was in danger. Can't I have a
vested interest

07:28.839 --> 07:32.495
in the well-being of...
my youngest relative? Oh,

07:32.539 --> 07:34.236
you mean your blood bank
that you used

07:34.279 --> 07:35.498
to restore your youth?

07:35.542 --> 07:37.152
Tomayto, tomahto.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.284
Honestly, you very
much remind me

07:39.328 --> 07:42.592
of someone
I once failed to save.

07:42.636 --> 07:45.508
Set aside your hostility.

07:45.552 --> 07:48.685
You need my help.

07:48.729 --> 07:50.426
Mm.
I saw the three-fingered man

07:50.470 --> 07:53.211
the night
of your friends' engagement.

07:53.255 --> 07:55.387
How do you know
about the suspect?

07:55.431 --> 07:57.999
I overheard those
college boys yammering on

07:58.042 --> 07:59.522
about their story.

07:59.566 --> 08:01.568
The one about a menacing man
following them

08:01.611 --> 08:04.527
the day
of their friend's murder.

08:04.571 --> 08:07.182
You might have seen him, too.

08:07.225 --> 08:09.880
Oh, before he left
the crime scene? Yes.

08:09.924 --> 08:13.318
Our recollections
may be incomplete on their own,

08:13.362 --> 08:16.104
but...
I have something at my home

08:16.147 --> 08:19.629
that could serve
as a memory aid.

08:19.673 --> 08:21.544
Or perhaps we should simply wait

08:21.588 --> 08:25.548
until more innocent hearts
are ripped from chests.

08:25.592 --> 08:28.638
Who knows... maybe the next
ones could be our own.

08:30.814 --> 08:32.207
All right, Fan clan,

08:32.250 --> 08:33.600
mission today is find my ring

08:33.643 --> 08:35.079
and keep Nick away from me
until we do.

08:35.123 --> 08:36.820
I refuse to see
the look on his face

08:36.864 --> 08:39.388
if he finds out I lost it...
it'll absolutely kill him.

08:39.431 --> 08:40.476
Oh, God, Nick's here!

08:41.390 --> 08:42.565
I'll distract him.

08:42.609 --> 08:44.045
Go! Go!

08:48.092 --> 08:49.529
Hi!

08:49.572 --> 08:51.052
Hi. What's all this? Hey.

08:51.095 --> 08:53.054
Oh. Oh, yeah,
we're gonna test ways

08:53.097 --> 08:55.056
the killer
could have frozen Dustin's heart

08:55.099 --> 08:56.797
using pig hearts that Ace got

08:56.840 --> 08:58.755
from Frank the butcher.
Ew. Um, okay,

08:58.799 --> 09:00.540
well, we have customers in today

09:00.583 --> 09:02.542
and we don't want to scare
them, so why don't you go

09:02.585 --> 09:03.760
through the back door.

09:03.804 --> 09:05.414
Yeah, good idea.
Yeah.

09:06.676 --> 09:08.243
Ace!

09:08.286 --> 09:09.810
Whoa. Hey.

09:09.853 --> 09:11.812
Sorry, didn't... I didn't
mean to startle you.

09:11.855 --> 09:14.466
I was hoping to ask a favor.
Mr. Bobbsey,

09:14.510 --> 09:15.729
you know you can call me, right?

09:15.772 --> 09:17.165
I was in the neighborhood, so...

09:17.208 --> 09:19.602
Plus, I... I hate the
telephone, you know?

09:19.646 --> 09:22.257
People say one thing, and then
their face says something else.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.737
Yeah.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.695
So, what's up? Can you pick me up tonight,

09:25.739 --> 09:27.610
121 Harlowe Street, 9:00 p.m.?

09:27.654 --> 09:28.829
I'm catching up
with an old friend.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.134
If... if you can't,
no big deal.

09:30.178 --> 09:31.614
I could... I could
maybe walk it.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.442
No, I could do that. Yeah?

09:33.485 --> 09:35.096
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be there.

09:35.139 --> 09:37.098
I appreciate you, Ace.
You know that, right?

09:37.141 --> 09:39.491
Ah, Amanda was right about you.

09:39.535 --> 09:41.581
You're a good egg. You are, too.

09:46.847 --> 09:49.240
Is he harassing you? No. He needs a ride.

09:49.284 --> 09:52.896
Doesn't have his driver's
license back yet.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.506
Why do you have a
problem with him?

09:54.550 --> 09:56.508
Because he's super sketchy
and just got out of jail.

09:56.552 --> 09:57.814
On good behavior.

09:57.858 --> 09:59.816
He's just trying to start fresh.

09:59.860 --> 10:02.297
I'm trying to help him.
I promised Amanda I would.

10:02.340 --> 10:04.255
Mm. Oh, you just got a...

10:04.299 --> 10:05.648
Oh, sorry.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.650
It's just a little fly.

10:07.694 --> 10:10.261
Thanks.
Mm-hmm. No problem.

10:19.531 --> 10:23.057
While we're freezing
heart number one in dry ice,

10:23.100 --> 10:26.060
we can flash-freeze
heart number two

10:26.103 --> 10:27.931
using liquid nitrogen.

10:27.975 --> 10:30.630
Whoa, you ever done this before?

10:30.673 --> 10:32.066
No.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.633
But I watched a YouTube video.

10:37.245 --> 10:39.551
Okay, now what?

10:39.595 --> 10:42.990
Flash-freezing's actually
a misnomer.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.687
Takes about 20 minutes.

10:47.472 --> 10:48.822
Okay.

10:54.741 --> 10:58.135
So, how is engaged life?

10:58.179 --> 10:59.615
Oh.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.399
Yeah,

11:01.443 --> 11:04.533
it's good, but sometimes I
feel like an outsider, and...

11:04.576 --> 11:08.624
I want to be part of
the Fan sisters' lives, but...

11:08.668 --> 11:10.234
I'm not sure how.

11:10.278 --> 11:11.671
Oh.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.542
Yet.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.687
Do you know
what a memory weave is?

11:29.384 --> 11:32.169
Mystical arts and crafts.

11:33.170 --> 11:35.303
It's a powerful ritual
that combines the memories

11:35.346 --> 11:36.739
of two people

11:36.783 --> 11:38.872
who were at the same place
at the same time,

11:38.915 --> 11:41.004
in order to weave
a fuller picture

11:41.048 --> 11:42.963
of a moment, revealing details

11:43.006 --> 11:45.748
a single human consciousness
would otherwise miss.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.750
Oh.
But first I need access to your memories.

11:47.794 --> 11:48.751
Access?

11:48.795 --> 11:50.318
Oh, no, I don't...

12:00.458 --> 12:02.983
This is the day of Nick
and George's engagement.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.161
What did you do to me?

12:07.204 --> 12:09.250
♪ ♪

12:15.430 --> 12:17.911
The answer's here, so here we are.

12:17.954 --> 12:20.000
You had no right. The memory weave

12:20.043 --> 12:23.655
can only sustain itself for
a few moments before collapsing.

12:23.699 --> 12:24.787
Look.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.963
The show's starting.

12:27.007 --> 12:28.660
There's you.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.010
I was watching you from here.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.838
The oversharing on social media

12:31.881 --> 12:33.840
makes your generation
so easy to stalk.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.954
It's him.

13:04.044 --> 13:06.437
Whoa.

13:06.481 --> 13:08.439
Time's up.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.051
And now we have a lead

13:11.094 --> 13:13.053
on the man
who infiltrated my home.

13:15.011 --> 13:18.101
You could say thank you. For roofieing me?

13:18.145 --> 13:19.494
Pass.

13:31.549 --> 13:33.856
Hey, uh, you need anything
from the store?

13:33.900 --> 13:37.338
Do you have any idea why Nancy
is waiting for a rideshare

13:37.381 --> 13:40.254
outside Icarus Hall right now?

13:40.297 --> 13:41.864
Wait.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.475
Are you tracking her phone

13:44.519 --> 13:46.390
on an app?

13:46.434 --> 13:48.349
She kept responding to my texts
with the same thumbs-up emoji.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.655
So I tried calling to check in.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.657
She didn't answer.
So I called the station.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.311
They said she wasn't there.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.705
Oh, my God, bro,
you have no chill.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.013
I don't need chill.

14:00.056 --> 14:02.276
I need to know
that my daughter is safe. Our daughter...

14:02.319 --> 14:03.625
is safe.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.627
And, come on,
don't you trust her?

14:06.628 --> 14:08.325
Put the phone down,

14:08.369 --> 14:10.023
Carson.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.589
If she needs you,
she'll call you.

14:15.115 --> 14:16.943
There you go.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.954
Okay...

14:31.871 --> 14:34.264
Do I want to know?

14:34.308 --> 14:36.745
It's Martha Marvin's
protection ritual.

14:36.788 --> 14:38.442
Doing it for Ace.

14:38.486 --> 14:40.227
You actually think
you could pull it off?

14:40.270 --> 14:42.098
Well, I'm choosing to believe
that my ancestors' talents

14:42.142 --> 14:43.578
are genetic.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.058
Ooh.

14:47.669 --> 14:49.801
Good.

14:49.845 --> 14:53.370
Wait, what does Ace
need protection from?

14:53.414 --> 14:55.503
The serial killer.
Yeah, in case they're targeting

14:55.546 --> 14:57.635
young, vulnerable men.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.420
I'll do Nick next.

15:01.683 --> 15:02.945
Nick.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.729
Hey, Jesse.
Hey.

15:04.773 --> 15:08.951

15:25.968 --> 15:27.709

I got a pig heart

in my eyeball! You all right?

17:02.151 --> 17:03.892
Yeah.

17:03.935 --> 17:06.503

Okay, uh...

17:08.810 --> 17:12.901

17:16.557 --> 17:18.646
The ice crystal patterns
in both these hearts

17:18.689 --> 17:21.344
are different from
Dustin's heart.

17:21.388 --> 17:24.217
The killer did not use
liquid nitrogen or dry ice.

17:24.260 --> 17:25.870
Well...

17:25.914 --> 17:27.916
on to heart number three.

17:28.917 --> 17:31.006
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.095
Nitrogen is-is a liquid, right?

17:33.139 --> 17:35.880
And-and the dry ice is a solid.

17:35.924 --> 17:39.014
So what if the killer used a gas
to freeze these hearts?

17:41.277 --> 17:43.323
Sometimes radiologists use
argon gas

17:43.366 --> 17:45.281
to freeze tumors
in cancer patients.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.849
Argon is a heavy gas.

17:47.892 --> 17:49.894
If that's what the killer used,
it'd still be present

17:49.938 --> 17:52.506
in the corpse. Check with Connor.

18:02.994 --> 18:04.692
I am guessing

18:04.735 --> 18:06.215
that's not what
you were looking for.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.698
I lost my engagement ring.

18:10.741 --> 18:12.917
What? How?

18:12.961 --> 18:14.397
If I knew,
I wouldn't be shoving my hand

18:14.441 --> 18:15.877
into this pit of despair,
now, would I?

18:15.920 --> 18:17.922
Yeah, well,
you've been here all day, right?

18:17.966 --> 18:19.489
Couldn't have gone far.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.143
It's probably in the place
you'd least expect.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.710
Thanks.

18:22.753 --> 18:23.885
Did you take it...

18:30.196 --> 18:32.372
What's with the peas?

18:32.415 --> 18:34.374
Uh, Connor confirmed
the presence of argon gas

18:34.417 --> 18:35.679
in Dustin's body.

18:35.723 --> 18:37.377
Argon is used in welding.

18:37.420 --> 18:40.380
Might explain the burns
in Dustin's chest, right?

18:40.423 --> 18:43.122
Any idea
how the killer got argon?

18:43.165 --> 18:45.341
Yeah, here's a list of
all the local businesses

18:45.385 --> 18:47.169
that sell welding equipment.

18:47.213 --> 18:50.259
I figured HBPD can get access
to the purchasing records

18:50.303 --> 18:53.088
faster than we can. Yeah, I'll let you know
what I find.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.402
Whoa, whoa!

19:04.752 --> 19:06.406
What happened?

19:06.449 --> 19:08.321
It is not Ace's day.

19:08.364 --> 19:09.322
Can you, uh...

19:09.365 --> 19:11.411
Glue that up? Yeah.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.631
Ace, you okay?

19:16.285 --> 19:17.547
Okay, I've got

19:17.591 --> 19:18.635
two solid leads...

19:18.679 --> 19:20.159
Ooh. Sorry.

19:20.202 --> 19:21.638
Uh...

19:21.682 --> 19:23.901
you meditating? I find it easier

19:23.945 --> 19:25.555
to listen with my eyes closed.

19:25.599 --> 19:26.861
How can I help you?

19:26.904 --> 19:28.993
Oh, Premeditated

19:29.037 --> 19:30.430
with Laci McAllister.

19:30.473 --> 19:32.432
Is that a true crime podcast?

19:32.475 --> 19:34.434
Who's the Frozen Hearts Killer?

19:34.477 --> 19:36.566
A serial killer who
started in Alaska

19:36.610 --> 19:39.526
ten years ago, then worked
his way across the Lower 49.

19:39.569 --> 19:42.181
The killer freezes
their victim's hearts.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.704
Killing stopped about
three years ago.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.009
You think that's our guy?

19:45.053 --> 19:46.272
Did cross my mind.

19:46.315 --> 19:48.491
Do you get a lot of leads
from podcasts?

19:48.535 --> 19:50.798
No. I've been following
this unsub for a while now.

19:50.841 --> 19:52.887
It's actually why
they assigned me here.

19:52.930 --> 19:54.584
But I do find
Laci's podcast relaxing,

19:54.628 --> 19:56.282
and I'll take leads
from anywhere.

19:56.325 --> 19:58.022
Ah. Good.

19:58.066 --> 20:00.416
Because here are mine.

20:00.460 --> 20:04.115
So, the coroner found traces
of argon in Dustin's body.

20:04.159 --> 20:06.553
I think that's how the killer
froze his heart.

20:06.596 --> 20:08.294
Argon-induced frostbite
sounds like a good way

20:08.337 --> 20:09.686
to lose two fingers. Right?

20:09.730 --> 20:11.514
So, there's a couple
of local vendors

20:11.558 --> 20:13.124
that source argon.

20:13.168 --> 20:14.865
The killer drives a white van.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.737
This is
his license plate number.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.695
If you get
the vendors' purchase records,

20:18.739 --> 20:20.306
you can cross-reference
that list

20:20.349 --> 20:22.308
with whoever that van
is registered to.

20:22.351 --> 20:23.787
And I was there the day

20:23.831 --> 20:25.485
the killer put Dustin's corpse
on my car.

20:25.528 --> 20:28.096
I caught a glimpse of him
before the body drop happened.

20:28.139 --> 20:29.489
And...

20:29.532 --> 20:31.621
you're just remembering
all of this now,

20:31.665 --> 20:33.710
as well as the entire
license plate number?

20:33.754 --> 20:35.712
Yeah. I have eidetic memory.

20:37.366 --> 20:40.064
Um, sometimes my recall is...
delayed.

20:41.065 --> 20:43.720
No, that's not
how eidetic memory works.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.679
What aren't you telling me?

20:45.722 --> 20:47.507
Please run the plate.

20:49.726 --> 20:51.641
You don't have to stay with me.

20:51.685 --> 20:53.643
It's not your fault
that I slipped in a puddle

20:53.687 --> 20:55.123
of melted hard ice.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.733
Well, it is my fault

20:56.777 --> 20:58.039
a little.

20:58.082 --> 20:59.997
I performed
a protection ritual on you,

21:00.041 --> 21:03.305
but I must have messed it up,
because you keep getting hurt.

21:04.524 --> 21:06.613
You're trying to do magic now?

21:06.656 --> 21:08.702
No, I was just trying to help.

21:08.745 --> 21:10.356
You're in danger. I slipped in a puddle.

21:10.399 --> 21:13.010
The hook was loose, okay?

21:13.054 --> 21:15.186
There's nothing
mystical happening.

21:16.362 --> 21:18.494
I'm not in danger.

21:19.495 --> 21:20.714
Ridiculous.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.846
Careful.

21:32.987 --> 21:36.120
Got a name: Richard Trott.
He's the van's owner.

21:36.164 --> 21:38.906
He recently placed a
large order for argon. Oh, my God.

21:38.949 --> 21:41.082
Don't. Uh, no
online presence.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.910
"Richard Trott" is an alias.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.520
But his van did get
a toll booth ticket

21:44.564 --> 21:46.174
back in Alaska in 2005.

21:46.217 --> 21:48.176
Same year the frozen
body parts serial killer

21:48.219 --> 21:50.265
was reportedly
active in that area.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.788
Same goes for Oregon
and Virginia.

21:51.832 --> 21:54.182
Well, that's got to be our guy.

21:54.225 --> 21:56.445
What is he doing
in Horseshoe Bay?

21:56.489 --> 21:58.317
What does he want with me?

21:58.360 --> 21:59.883
Won't matter once
he's behind bars.

21:59.927 --> 22:01.537
Which he should be very soon,

22:01.581 --> 22:02.843
due to your solid leads.

22:02.886 --> 22:05.019
So... thank you.

22:07.151 --> 22:08.849
Uh...

22:08.892 --> 22:11.373
I don't think anybody here
has ever thanked me before.

22:11.417 --> 22:14.985
Well... on behalf of law
enforcement everywhere,

22:15.029 --> 22:16.813
good job.

22:22.123 --> 22:23.864
The argon vendor just texted me.

22:27.171 --> 22:28.259
This is the address

22:28.303 --> 22:30.087
the argon shipment went to.

22:30.131 --> 22:32.176
I'll meet you all there.

22:38.966 --> 22:40.663
Hey, wait a sec.

22:40.707 --> 22:42.883
Is Trott
at 365 Hamden Forest Drive?

22:42.926 --> 22:44.450
We'll find out.
Going to the courthouse

22:44.493 --> 22:46.277
to rush a warrant. It's just,

22:46.321 --> 22:48.279
uh, Hamden Forest Drive isn't
in the right parking zone.

22:48.323 --> 22:50.717
The van had a decal

22:50.760 --> 22:52.414
for zone 6R.

22:52.458 --> 22:55.896
So why would Trott park half
a mile from his address?

22:55.939 --> 22:57.593
You need a second warrant.

22:57.637 --> 22:59.726
I can't get a warrant
for an entire zone.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.292
I'll start with the house.

23:01.336 --> 23:02.729
Send a unit to zone 6R.

23:02.772 --> 23:03.947
Maybe, uh,

23:03.991 --> 23:05.427
I could ride along.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.342
It's likely Trott
wants to kill you.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.518
You'll only make it easier for him
if you try and chase him down.

23:09.562 --> 23:11.172
My answer is no.

23:20.747 --> 23:24.054
"My next-door neighbor has been
disposing of waste improperly.

23:24.098 --> 23:27.057
I've seen him put
empty chemical canisters

23:27.101 --> 23:28.494
in his recycling..."

23:28.537 --> 23:30.496
4660 Cascade.

23:39.635 --> 23:41.507
Hey, what's up? Hey, Ryan.

23:41.550 --> 23:46.076
Can you give me a ride
to 4660 Cascade Avenue?

23:55.477 --> 23:58.219
All right, 4660 Cascade.

23:59.002 --> 24:01.744
You know, you can... can tell me
what we're really doing here.

24:01.788 --> 24:04.399
I'm not gonna flip out,
like some other dads would.

24:05.835 --> 24:07.794
I am on a case,

24:07.837 --> 24:10.144
and the police have iced me out.

24:10.187 --> 24:13.495
I'm trying to work with them,
but neither they nor Carson

24:13.539 --> 24:15.932
wants me to help
with the investigation.

24:15.976 --> 24:17.760
So, where's the lead?

24:17.804 --> 24:20.241
Well...

24:28.902 --> 24:30.381
Hey, the-the chimney's
still going.

24:30.425 --> 24:32.209
Are you sure that no one's home?

24:33.863 --> 24:36.083
It's too warm for a fire.

24:36.126 --> 24:38.912
Oh, my God,
they're destroying the evidence.

24:38.955 --> 24:41.088
I have to stop them.
Wait. Wait, hold on.

24:41.131 --> 24:42.437
You're going inside there?

24:42.481 --> 24:43.569
Is this person dangerous?

24:43.612 --> 24:45.222
Uh, no. Uh...

24:45.266 --> 24:47.181
it's a white-collar crime,
a parking ticket scam.

24:47.224 --> 24:48.835
Can you stay in the car?
Just be my lookout.

24:48.878 --> 24:50.401
But do you have permission?

24:50.445 --> 24:52.316
Sorry, what's that, Carson?

24:52.360 --> 24:54.014
Okay.

24:54.057 --> 24:56.843
Yeah, I'll just...

24:56.886 --> 24:59.541
I'll wait here in the car.

25:32.356 --> 25:33.619
Hi.

25:33.662 --> 25:35.185
Did you get my text?

25:35.229 --> 25:37.187
No. I am trying
to break into a suspect's house.

25:37.231 --> 25:38.798
Great, totally understand,

25:38.841 --> 25:40.626
and you should be very careful
doing that.

25:40.669 --> 25:43.106
But can I just bug you
for a tiny favor?

25:43.150 --> 25:44.891
I'm looking for a candle.

25:44.934 --> 25:46.545
You're calling me about a candle?

25:46.588 --> 25:48.329
Yeah, it's a Marvin
family heirloom.

25:48.372 --> 25:50.331
And according to
the Historical Society's ledger,

25:50.374 --> 25:53.813
Temperance's daughter Charity
stole it in 1861.

25:53.856 --> 25:55.466
And if Temperance ended up
with the candle,

25:55.510 --> 25:57.817
it could be in Icarus Hall...
you were there...

26:00.820 --> 26:04.258
It was on the mantel
under a moose skull.

26:04.301 --> 26:05.955
Okay, thanks.
Ooh, could we just...

26:07.000 --> 26:08.436
Okay...

26:29.588 --> 26:31.590
Whew.

26:42.209 --> 26:44.907
Oh, damn!
The drain is clogged again.

26:50.391 --> 26:54.090
How long ago did you lose
your engagement ring?

26:54.134 --> 26:55.918
How long what...

26:55.962 --> 26:58.312
Excuse me? What? You've been hiding

26:58.355 --> 27:00.662
your left hand from me
most of the day. Hiding?

27:00.706 --> 27:03.578
No. Babe,
this hand has been working.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.757
Why didn't you tell me?

27:13.283 --> 27:17.070
Because I was trying to avoid
that look on your face.

27:17.113 --> 27:20.116
See, yeah, that look.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.684
Nick, I'm so sorry.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.296
Hey.

27:27.776 --> 27:29.691
Hmm.

27:29.735 --> 27:34.000
It's just a small piece
of rock and metal, right?

27:34.043 --> 27:36.089
No, it's not.

27:36.132 --> 27:37.830
It was a sign to the world

27:37.873 --> 27:39.832
that I have a future
to live for.

27:39.875 --> 27:41.703
Every time I look down
at that ring,

27:41.747 --> 27:43.487
I imagine our future together.

27:43.531 --> 27:45.838
Now it's gone.

27:45.881 --> 27:48.710
But I'm still here.

27:48.754 --> 27:52.018
And we are gonna make the
most of the years we have.

27:52.061 --> 27:55.978
And if you need a reminder...

27:56.022 --> 27:58.285
just look at me.

28:00.417 --> 28:02.202
Okay.

28:02.245 --> 28:03.769
♪ ♪

28:29.229 --> 28:30.970
♪ ♪

28:37.803 --> 28:40.153
A human heart.

29:09.791 --> 29:12.315
Oh, it's a minefield.

29:35.295 --> 29:36.949
Hey! Hey!
Nancy's inside!

29:36.992 --> 29:38.689
Sir, I need you to stay
right where you are.

29:38.733 --> 29:40.561
Is she okay? Is-is she okay?

29:40.604 --> 29:41.867
Stay back.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.871
Okay.

29:46.872 --> 29:48.830
Nancy, it's Agent Park!

29:48.874 --> 29:50.266
Can you hear me?

29:50.310 --> 29:51.920
No, uh, don't come in.

29:51.964 --> 29:55.402
If you come in, everything
would be inadmissible,

29:55.445 --> 29:56.795
and it'll be my fault.

29:56.838 --> 29:58.927
So just let me try
and figure it out.

30:06.021 --> 30:07.588
Hey, what are you doing here?

30:07.631 --> 30:09.198
What are you doing here?

30:09.242 --> 30:11.070
The police scanner said
that there was a civilian

30:11.113 --> 30:12.419
trapped in a suspect's house,

30:12.462 --> 30:13.855
and Nancy's phone
was at the same address.

30:15.291 --> 30:16.684
Tell me
you didn't bring her here.

30:16.727 --> 30:18.338
Look, I didn't know.
She asked for a ride.

30:18.381 --> 30:20.514
She said it was a parking
ticket, white-collar thing,

30:20.557 --> 30:21.907
so I-I was just trying
to be supportive.

30:21.950 --> 30:23.386
No, you were trying to be "Cool Dad."

30:23.430 --> 30:25.345
You let her manipulate you.

30:25.388 --> 30:26.694
You're supposed to protect her.

30:26.737 --> 30:27.651
What the hell
am I supposed to do

30:27.695 --> 30:30.089
when she is who she is?

30:32.308 --> 30:34.441
They're pipe bombs.

30:34.484 --> 30:37.966
Yeah, you should have
led with that. Well, I thought

30:38.010 --> 30:40.882
you would detect it from the
tone of my voice, FBI profiler.

30:40.926 --> 30:43.189
Yeah, well, I'm not that good.

30:48.803 --> 30:50.761
Nancy...

30:50.805 --> 30:52.372
you're gonna be just fine.

30:52.415 --> 30:54.330
But I need you to stay

30:54.374 --> 30:56.158
completely still.

30:56.202 --> 30:58.247
Your weight is holding
down a trigger,

30:58.291 --> 31:01.903
and we don't know how sensitive
that release plate is.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.174
You should go.

31:29.713 --> 31:31.802
Are we okay?

31:43.597 --> 31:45.904
I think we are now.

32:02.355 --> 32:04.531
What time did you arrive?

32:04.574 --> 32:06.663
Little after 4:00 p.m.

32:06.707 --> 32:10.493
The chimney was smoking,
so I had to go in.

32:10.537 --> 32:12.408
I understand.

32:12.452 --> 32:15.194
How did you enter the premises?

32:15.237 --> 32:16.891
Through a...

32:16.935 --> 32:18.675
through a back door.

32:18.719 --> 32:20.460
Look, are we not gonna talk

32:20.503 --> 32:22.331
about the fact
that I screwed up?

32:22.375 --> 32:24.246
At this point, I'm just
gathering data for my report.

32:24.290 --> 32:25.856
Well, will your report
include the fact

32:25.900 --> 32:27.989
that I put the case in danger

32:28.033 --> 32:31.427
and how my entry was illegal

32:31.471 --> 32:32.733
and evidence was destroyed

32:32.776 --> 32:33.908
and now Trott's in the wind

32:33.952 --> 32:35.562
and we don't have
any other leads

32:35.605 --> 32:37.651
and we don't even know
what his real name is... Hey.

32:37.694 --> 32:40.001
You made an error in judgment.

32:40.045 --> 32:41.698
It happens.

32:42.873 --> 32:46.529
Dwelling in frustration
or guilt...

32:46.573 --> 32:49.271
it's not gonna move the
investigation forward.

32:49.315 --> 32:52.187
Was there anything else?

32:52.231 --> 32:53.928
Yes.

32:55.234 --> 32:58.324
Thank you for risking your life
to save mine.

32:58.367 --> 33:01.022
Don't even think about it.

33:05.722 --> 33:07.594
Your hands are shaking.

Uh...

33:09.161 --> 33:10.640
adrenaline.

33:10.684 --> 33:12.729
It'll wear off.

We should, uh,
finish this tomorrow.

Martha Marvin?

34:00.516 --> 34:02.518

You don't need that candle,
Bess. You need me.

34:09.482 --> 34:12.833
Um, no new friends, thank you.

It's why I became
a Woman in White.

34:28.283 --> 34:31.199

of Martha's rituals,

34:47.868 --> 34:49.913
which didn't work
and I don't know why.

34:49.957 --> 34:52.090
Because I had the blood
of the spider,

34:52.133 --> 34:54.396
the strand of hair
and the grind of mustard.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.398
Mm.

34:56.442 --> 34:59.575
A protection ritual
calls for grain...

34:59.619 --> 35:02.535

I was doing a protection ritual?

I told you,

35:11.587 --> 35:14.112
I created all of the rituals
in Martha's book.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.549
Would you like me to
teach you something?

35:16.592 --> 35:18.899
Something small?

Hey.

37:29.334 --> 37:30.683
Did, uh, we get

37:30.726 --> 37:32.380
our nightly door-knocks?

37:32.424 --> 37:34.034
Yep.

37:34.077 --> 37:36.428
Scary pounding,
then it stopped...

37:36.471 --> 37:38.821
nobody was
on the doorbell camera. Yeah, but

37:38.865 --> 37:40.867
someone or something
just keeps knocking...

37:40.910 --> 37:42.477
Nancy, can we please, please,

37:42.521 --> 37:45.524
please just stop talking
about the knocking for a minute?

37:45.567 --> 37:48.353

I want that, too. I-I...
Oh, yeah? Well, you could have fooled me.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.578
Oh, wait, no.

37:56.622 --> 37:58.624
You did fool me.
If you had known the truth,

37:58.667 --> 38:00.103
you would never have let me go.

38:00.147 --> 38:01.627
And you would have
followed me in there.

38:01.670 --> 38:03.281
We came with you anyway.

38:04.543 --> 38:06.284
Every time

38:06.327 --> 38:08.329
you go running into some

38:08.373 --> 38:10.984
serial killer's house,

38:11.027 --> 38:14.074
or into a fire or off a cliff,

38:14.117 --> 38:15.989
you take me with you.

38:16.032 --> 38:18.731
You take everyone who
loves you with you.

38:18.774 --> 38:20.254
Running...
it... that's in my nature,

38:20.298 --> 38:22.300
so I don't...
I don't know...

38:22.343 --> 38:24.171
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

38:24.214 --> 38:26.216
You can meet us halfway.

38:26.260 --> 38:29.829
Communicate with us,
transparently.

38:29.872 --> 38:31.352
And then next time

38:31.396 --> 38:33.615
you're running into
something dangerous...

38:36.009 --> 38:38.141
...remember you're not alone.

38:41.928 --> 38:44.409
Okay, I can do that.

38:46.933 --> 38:48.978
I'm sorry that I scared you.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.071
Night, Dads.

39:04.733 --> 39:07.257
Look, nobody ever taught me
how to parent.

39:07.301 --> 39:09.347
We're all just trying our best.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.654
Hoping it's enough.

39:18.530 --> 39:20.662
Just, I-I got nothing
to offer her.

39:20.706 --> 39:22.490
Was never really good in school.

39:22.534 --> 39:24.797
I, uh, got no
career. I...

39:24.840 --> 39:27.669
I don't even know
who I'm supposed to be.

39:29.367 --> 39:32.239
I can't answer that for you.

39:39.377 --> 39:42.423
♪ And there's no one left
to take with you... ♪

39:44.947 --> 39:47.385
Perfect.
Thank you, Nick.

39:47.428 --> 39:48.908
Okay.

39:48.951 --> 39:50.344
Okay, guys, okay, okay.

39:50.388 --> 39:53.652
Jungkook... purple hair or blue?

39:53.695 --> 39:55.088
Purple.

39:55.131 --> 39:56.089
Blue. Purple, yeah.

39:56.132 --> 39:57.307
Purple? It's blue.

39:57.351 --> 39:58.091
Blue? Blue? It's... No, purple.

39:58.134 --> 39:59.179
Trick question.

39:59.222 --> 40:00.702
Blond.

40:00.746 --> 40:02.704
Wait, when did he dye
his hair blond?

40:02.748 --> 40:04.924
Hey, hey, come on.

40:04.967 --> 40:08.014
Yeah? Oh, really? Really?

40:11.800 --> 40:14.629
Well, listeners, after all these years,

40:14.673 --> 40:18.503
I finally know the true identity
of the Frozen Hearts Killer.

40:18.546 --> 40:21.201
My hunches about this case
have been correct,

40:21.244 --> 40:23.508
and I have no doubt
who our murderer is.

40:23.551 --> 40:25.510
Tune in next week to find out.

40:25.553 --> 40:27.816
In the meantime,
I'll be signing merch tomorrow

40:27.860 --> 40:30.732
at DetectiveCon
in Portland, Maine.

40:52.798 --> 40:54.800
Hey.

40:54.843 --> 40:56.366
Drive.

40:58.978 --> 41:00.675
Nope. Get out.

41:02.895 --> 41:05.027
Whoa.

41:05.071 --> 41:07.856
What? You scared
of a little blood?

41:07.900 --> 41:09.423
It's not what you think.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.512
No, no, I said that
I would give you rides.

41:11.556 --> 41:12.774
I never said
I'd be an accomplice.

41:12.818 --> 41:15.168
Get out of my car.

41:15.211 --> 41:17.170
You're gonna regret this.

41:25.439 --> 41:28.660
Bring light, bring life,

41:28.703 --> 41:31.227
carry this energy
into the night.

41:32.925 --> 41:34.970
Oh, my God.

41:35.971 --> 41:38.017
Bess Marvin...

41:40.062 --> 41:42.935
...I think you're destined for greatness.
