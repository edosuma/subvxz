the secret life of the American teenager

00:02.635 --> 00:04.100
- You're moving?
- I am.

00:04.135 --> 00:05.800
Oh, George, thank you.

00:05.835 --> 00:08.300
I know I shouldn't ask,
but I'm gonna anyway.

00:08.335 --> 00:11.800
Did you really need balloons,
or did you just wanna see me?

00:11.835 --> 00:13.200
I wanted to see you.

00:14.900 --> 00:16.800
I asked for the divorce.
A man has to take blame.

00:16.835 --> 00:17.600
It's not your fault.

00:17.635 --> 00:19.100
What about Adrian's mom?

00:19.200 --> 00:21.600
I couldn't call you.
Ruben talked to my dad.

00:21.635 --> 00:23.500
He said if I didn't break this off

00:23.535 --> 00:25.300
he and my dad are gonna
send me to military school.

00:25.335 --> 00:27.200
- So you're here because...?
- I miss you.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.500
I want to hit that lady.

00:29.535 --> 00:30.500
It's okay, Tammy.

00:30.535 --> 00:32.500
I know it was upsetting,
but it was just a car.

00:32.534 --> 00:33.800
Thankfully no one got hurt.

00:33.835 --> 00:35.500
Amy, are you okay?

00:35.535 --> 00:37.800
I think this is it, Mom.
I'm having the baby.

00:37.835 --> 00:39.200
- You tell her?
- Didn't get a chance.

00:39.235 --> 00:41.400
I think Amy's in labor.
Meet us at the hospital.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.400
I hope one afternoon was
worth eight weeks of boot camp.

00:44.435 --> 00:46.500
It was. I think I'm in love,
to tell you the truth.

00:46.535 --> 00:47.400
In love?

00:47.500 --> 00:49.500
There's something I wanted to tell you.

00:49.535 --> 00:51.600
I hope this isn't about
those birth control pills.

00:51.635 --> 00:53.100
What are you and Ashley not telling me?

00:53.135 --> 00:54.500
Ashley's moving in with me.

00:54.535 --> 00:56.900
Hi, Ricky, it's me, Amy.
The baby's coming.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.200
I think you should be here. He's your son.

Einght months and two weeks ago...

02:17.700 --> 02:18.500
Hi.

02:19.600 --> 02:20.800
Hi!

02:21.200 --> 02:22.700
Are you Amy?

02:23.600 --> 02:24.600
I'm Ricky.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.500
Someone told me you're
going to Grant in the fall.

02:26.535 --> 02:29.100
Yeah. Grant High School, you mean.

02:29.135 --> 02:31.400
<i>What else would he mean? You're such a dork.</i>

02:31.435 --> 02:33.500
Yeah, Grant High School, that's my school.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.200
We're gonna be going to the same school.

02:35.235 --> 02:36.900
We'll be in the same band.

02:37.300 --> 02:38.500
Mind if I sit down?

02:38.600 --> 02:40.000
Oh, no. Go ahead.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.000
<i>Does he want me to get up?</i>

02:44.035 --> 02:45.800
I'm sorry, were you waiting for someone?

02:45.835 --> 02:47.300
Like, a boyfriend maybe?

02:47.335 --> 02:49.900
Me? No, I don't have a boyfriend.

02:49.935 --> 02:52.600
Come on. a girl as pretty
as you doesn't have a boyfriend?

02:52.800 --> 02:54.500
- Ha, no.
- Why not?

02:55.100 --> 02:57.100
I don't know. I don't want a boyfriend.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.100
I'm not that interested in guys right now.

02:59.135 --> 03:02.100
Oh. You go the other way.
Nothing wrong with that.

03:02.135 --> 03:04.800
No. No. I-- I like boys.

03:04.835 --> 03:07.400
It's, uh-- I mean,
I like girls too, but--

03:07.435 --> 03:08.900
Nothing wrong with that.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.500
No, I just-- I don't have a boyfriend.

03:11.700 --> 03:14.100
I mean, I have a couple of
really close girlfriends.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.900
Friends who are girls.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.100
But you don't have a boyfriend.

03:18.135 --> 03:19.000
No.

03:19.035 --> 03:20.200
Hi, Ricky.

03:20.900 --> 03:21.800
Hi.

03:22.500 --> 03:23.400
Gail.

03:24.300 --> 03:25.300
Hi, Gail.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.200
You don't even remember, do you?

03:30.500 --> 03:31.700
Remember...?

03:34.100 --> 03:34.900
Oh.

03:36.000 --> 03:36.900
Forget it.

03:37.800 --> 03:38.900
All right.

03:41.400 --> 03:45.100
I remember. I made out with her
under the bleachers last summer,

03:45.135 --> 03:47.600
only to find out she's got
a boyfriend here at camp.

03:47.635 --> 03:48.400
I don't want any trouble,

03:48.435 --> 03:50.600
that's why I was asking about your boyfriend.

03:50.635 --> 03:52.900
<i>Oh, my God. I think he likes me.</i>

03:53.300 --> 03:55.100
I don't have a boyfriend.

03:55.135 --> 03:56.400
All right, then.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.700
I'm not exactly boyfriend material,

03:58.735 --> 04:01.200
but maybe we could do something tonight.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.000
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

04:03.035 --> 04:05.200
Me and you. Unless you don't want to.

04:05.235 --> 04:09.200
No, it's just that, uh--
I'm the freshman soloist tonight.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.500
Wow. I'm impressed.

04:11.535 --> 04:14.900
Then I'll make sure I'm there
at the concert to hear you play.

04:14.935 --> 04:16.800
<i>Like I'm not nervous enough.</i>

04:17.399 --> 04:18.899
See you later, Amy.

04:21.700 --> 04:22.700
So...

04:23.400 --> 04:25.300
Ricky Underwood asked you out?

04:25.700 --> 04:29.100
Aren't you just the princess
of the best of the best band camp.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.100
Every girl at this camp
wants to go out with him.

04:33.500 --> 04:34.300
Really?

04:34.335 --> 04:37.300
Yeah, really. He is so hot.

04:38.500 --> 04:41.800
Yeah, I guess he is. Heh.

04:41.835 --> 04:44.200
Just be careful.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.000
Hey, I can't talk right now.

04:55.035 --> 04:56.300
We're in orientation.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.500
Amy, high school is gonna be awesome.

05:07.600 --> 05:11.500
The hallways are gonna be filled with
guys who look just like that.

05:11.900 --> 05:14.200
I don't like guys who look just like that.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.700
I do.

05:16.700 --> 05:18.100
Just like that.

05:18.135 --> 05:19.100
Hey.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.600
Hey.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.400
Yeah, well, forget that,
because that is looking at someone else.

05:24.435 --> 05:26.100
Congratulations, you made cheering.

05:26.135 --> 05:27.900
I did! I'm so excited.

05:27.935 --> 05:29.200
But I'm not as good as the other girls.

05:29.235 --> 05:30.200
That can't be true.

05:30.235 --> 05:32.000
No, It's true.
There are such good tumblers.

05:32.035 --> 05:34.900
Thank goodness I'm not the top of
the pyramid, I'm the bottom.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.400
Well, the bottom's good.

05:36.435 --> 05:37.600
Or the top.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.400
Anywhere on the pyramid.

05:40.700 --> 05:41.800
Yeah.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.800
Hey, I had a really nice time
with you last weekend.

05:43.835 --> 05:45.300
Oh, me too.

05:45.335 --> 05:47.000
I'm really enjoying getting to know you.

05:47.035 --> 05:49.700
I think you're the nicest, prettiest girl
I've ever been out with.

05:49.735 --> 05:50.600
Jack.

05:50.635 --> 05:51.900
No, I mean that.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.700
You're so sweet.

05:53.800 --> 05:54.800
Look.

05:55.100 --> 05:57.700
I know we've only been dating for a few weeks,

05:57.735 --> 06:00.000
but Grace, I really don't
want you dating anyone else.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.600
Oh.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.300
Well, I'm really flattered by that. I--

06:05.600 --> 06:09.200
I just don't know if my parents would think
we were getting too serious too quickly.

06:09.235 --> 06:10.900
Well, what do you think?

06:11.400 --> 06:13.000
Well, I think I could go along with it,

06:13.035 --> 06:15.600
but I would just want my parents to know,

06:15.635 --> 06:17.600
and I'm not ready to approach them yet.

06:17.700 --> 06:18.800
Maybe in a few weeks.

06:18.835 --> 06:21.300
So in the meantime you'd be
going out with other guys, or...

06:21.335 --> 06:23.800
Maybe. Just like you'd be
going out with other girls.

06:23.835 --> 06:25.700
I don't wanna go out with any other giirls.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.000
Then don't go out with other girls.

06:28.035 --> 06:29.700
And you won't go out with any other guys.

06:29.735 --> 06:30.900
We'll see.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.300
Come on, Grace, I can't wait weeks.

06:43.335 --> 06:44.700
Talk to your parents today.

06:50.300 --> 06:53.900
You girls aren't supposed to
be wandering the hallways.

06:53.935 --> 06:57.100
Well, we're not exactly wandering,
a-as much as lost.

06:57.135 --> 06:59.400
You know, I think I remember
how to get back to where we were.

06:59.435 --> 07:00.500
Hm.

07:01.300 --> 07:02.300
Oh.

07:06.100 --> 07:09.100
Oh, big day today.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.100
Phew. Big, big day.

07:11.135 --> 07:12.900
What if they don't take 'em off today?

07:13.300 --> 07:15.600
No, no. They'll take them off.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.900
They have to take them off.
They said they'd take them off.

07:17.935 --> 07:20.000
I mean, they can't just hold my teeth hostage.

07:20.300 --> 07:21.300
We could take 'em off.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.400
- How?
- Yeah, how?

07:23.435 --> 07:25.300
Pliers. How hard can it be?

07:25.335 --> 07:27.900
If it were that easy,
nobody would ever go to dentistry school.

07:27.935 --> 07:31.100
They'd just let high-schoolers
with pliers do all their dental work.

07:31.135 --> 07:32.500
What's the worst that could happen?

07:32.535 --> 07:33.600
You could kill him.

07:33.635 --> 07:36.100
I wouldn't care if he killed me.
At least I'd die happy.

07:36.135 --> 07:38.500
I mean, three years of wires and headgear.

07:38.535 --> 07:39.700
That's all I can take.

07:39.735 --> 07:41.300
I don't even notice them anymore.

07:41.335 --> 07:43.100
Well, I notice them. Ah.

07:43.135 --> 07:45.500
And don't tell me that
regular girls don't notice them.

07:45.600 --> 07:46.900
Regular? What do you mean?

07:47.300 --> 07:49.000
- Normal.
- I'm not normal?

07:49.035 --> 07:50.900
She's normal. Neither one of you are normal.

07:50.935 --> 07:52.500
It's okay. I'm not normal.

07:52.535 --> 07:55.300
I mean, we don't have
any friends outside of our group.

07:55.335 --> 07:58.700
And at least you have Alice.
I have no one.

07:58.735 --> 08:01.600
I can't get anyone with this metal mouth.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.800
Oh, and I have orientation this week!

08:04.835 --> 08:06.700
What are you talking about?

08:06.735 --> 08:08.400
Alice and I have lots of friends.

08:08.435 --> 08:11.200
No, you don't. I mean, you have me.
You have each other.

08:11.235 --> 08:12.900
But you can't talk to each other face to face.

08:12.935 --> 08:15.600
You instant message each other
when you're in the same room.

08:15.635 --> 08:17.400
We find the written word to be more personal.

08:17.435 --> 08:19.300
As soon as you say something it's gone.

08:19.335 --> 08:21.300
But once you've committed something to paper,

08:21.335 --> 08:24.100
or in this case computer,
it can last forever.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.500
I get nervous talking to her.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.400
Hey, guys.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.500
-Hello.
- The orthodontist just called.

08:31.535 --> 08:33.700
Seems like there's some
kind of emergency today.

08:33.735 --> 08:35.200
Too kids locked together.

08:35.235 --> 08:37.100
Apparently that happens a lot with braces.

08:37.135 --> 08:38.000
- What?
- Yeah.

08:38.034 --> 08:39.400
They're calling in the jaws of life.

08:39.434 --> 08:41.799
Said he could take you a week
after school starts.

08:41.835 --> 08:44.400
The week after school starts? After?

08:44.435 --> 08:47.100
Is there a problem?
It's the next appointment available.

08:47.135 --> 08:49.000
Call someone. Get me another orthodontist,

08:49.035 --> 08:51.000
or get somebody to come to the house.

08:51.035 --> 08:54.000
Come on. You waited three years,
what's a few more weeks?

08:54.035 --> 08:55.000
Dad!

08:57.400 --> 08:58.400
Oh.

08:58.700 --> 09:01.000
I'm just goofing on you. Come on, let's go.

09:01.035 --> 09:02.300
Not funny.

09:02.335 --> 09:04.300
You guys, uh, coming along for the unveiling?

09:04.335 --> 09:07.500
We can't just stay here,
the two of us, and wait, can we?

09:07.535 --> 09:09.200
No.

09:09.700 --> 09:10.600
Okay.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.200
Come on.

09:12.500 --> 09:13.600
Doesn't matter.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.800
Stay and wait here. Yeah, sure.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.300
Hey, honey.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.300
You stopped at the mall on your way home?

09:34.200 --> 09:35.500
You've been gone for three days.

09:35.535 --> 09:37.400
I needed to get some things.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.000
Lingerie things.

09:39.300 --> 09:40.200
Yeah.

09:41.100 --> 09:42.100
Who is it?

09:44.500 --> 09:46.800
I've been living out of my suitcase for 72 hours,

09:46.835 --> 09:49.000
and I can't buy something for myself?

09:49.035 --> 09:50.800
You can do whatever you want.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.100
Who is it?

09:52.135 --> 09:53.200
It's no one.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.900
Oh. He's married?

09:54.935 --> 09:58.600
He's not married...exactly.

09:58.635 --> 10:00.100
Yeah, okay.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.500
Okay, I know what this is all about.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.500
I haven't forgotten about your car.

10:04.535 --> 10:06.600
Good. Because I need a car, Mom.

10:06.635 --> 10:08.200
I'm working on it.

10:08.235 --> 10:10.900
Are you? Because you're never here.

10:10.935 --> 10:13.700
And there are only so many places I can walk to.

10:13.735 --> 10:16.800
And I hate asking the other majorettes
to pick me up for practice.

10:16.835 --> 10:18.900
Oh, and they hate it when I ask.

10:18.935 --> 10:19.900
We'll go tonight.

10:19.935 --> 10:21.200
Why can't we go this afternoon?

10:21.235 --> 10:23.300
Because there's something
I have to do this afternoon.

10:23.700 --> 10:27.400
Why can't you do what you
have to do this afternoon tonight?

10:27.435 --> 10:29.500
No. Let me answer that.

10:29.800 --> 10:32.100
Because he has to go home
to his wife tonight,

10:32.135 --> 10:33.700
but he can get away this afternoon?

10:33.735 --> 10:36.900
You want a car? Mind your own business.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.700
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.100
You want me to get your mom?

10:55.700 --> 10:57.500
Yeah. Get my mom.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.800
How long was I asleep for?

11:02.600 --> 11:04.100
About five minutes.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.200
Hi, Amy.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.100
Got you a burger and a shake.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.600
Is it from the Dairy Shack?

11:09.635 --> 11:11.800
No, it's from downstairs,
but it looks pretty good.

11:11.835 --> 11:13.300
Yeah, it looks good, Amy.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.300
You don't know anything.

11:15.335 --> 11:17.400
Sure I do. I work at a butcher shop.

11:17.435 --> 11:19.800
That is not the same quality
as the Dairy Shack.

11:19.900 --> 11:21.400
I want a Dairy Shack burger.

11:21.435 --> 11:23.500
Then why don't I go get that?

11:23.535 --> 11:25.700
Yeah. Why don't you?

11:28.900 --> 11:30.200
Well, that was a little harsh.

11:30.235 --> 11:32.100
It's the least he can do, don't you think?

11:32.135 --> 11:34.800
Amy, I really don't think
this is the time to be resentful.

11:34.835 --> 11:36.600
When would be a good time?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.300
I'm thinking the rest of my life.

11:39.600 --> 11:40.700
Don't go there.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.500
I'm hungry, and I'm tired,

11:45.000 --> 11:46.800
and I don't wanna do this.

11:46.835 --> 11:49.300
Well, I don't really think
that you have much choice.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.700
Oh, no.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.100
Here it comes again. Ow.

11:54.135 --> 11:55.900
Just breathe. Breathe, breathe.

11:55.935 --> 11:57.100
I never learned how to breathe.

11:57.135 --> 11:59.100
Why didn't we go to those classes?

11:59.135 --> 12:01.100
This is all your fault. Ow.

12:01.135 --> 12:02.600
I don't think so.

12:02.635 --> 12:06.600
Amy, I scheduled and rescheduled
that birthing class weekend three times.

12:06.700 --> 12:09.000
Just hang in there, Amy.
You're gonna be okay.

12:09.035 --> 12:11.600
I don't know what good
those classes would've done anyway.

12:12.600 --> 12:13.600
It would still hurt.

12:13.635 --> 12:15.400
Those classes are supposed to
make you feel better

12:15.435 --> 12:19.200
by giving you confidence that
childbirth is a completely natural thing.

12:19.235 --> 12:21.000
Forget natural.

12:21.035 --> 12:23.400
When do I get that shot in the spine?

12:24.100 --> 12:27.000
I never thought a shot in the spine
ould sound like something good.

12:27.035 --> 12:28.400
You know, Amy,

12:28.435 --> 12:30.500
you can't eat once you get the epidural.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.900
Call in the order at the Dairy Shack
and tell them it's a rush.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.200
This stinks.

12:36.900 --> 12:37.900
It's okay.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.100
It's all gonna be okay.

12:40.900 --> 12:43.100
No, it's not gonna be okay.

12:43.135 --> 12:45.400
I'm starving. And I'm kind of scared.

12:45.435 --> 12:47.700
Yeah, I know, it's scary giving birth.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.100
But it's okay. I'm gonna be here.

12:49.135 --> 12:50.700
I'll be here the whole time.

12:50.735 --> 12:53.700
And look at it this way,
he flipside of fear is excitement.

12:53.735 --> 12:55.600
So let's get excited.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.600
What are you gon name him?

12:57.635 --> 12:59.900
What am I gonna name the baby?

12:59.935 --> 13:01.900
I'm going to name the baby?

13:01.935 --> 13:04.300
Well, yeah. Who else do you
think's gonna name the baby?

13:04.335 --> 13:07.900
I don't know. I'm a minor.
I thought maybe you and Dad.

13:07.935 --> 13:09.900
I mean, I thought I'd suggest a few names,

13:09.935 --> 13:11.800
but, really, a name is a serious thing.

13:11.835 --> 13:13.900
He's gonna be stuck with it his whole life.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.500
And now is not the time for me
to be coming up with some name.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.100
I'm busy here.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.700
I can't think of
anything other than that burger,

13:21.735 --> 13:25.700
and I just don't see
how this is gonna work.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.700
I mean, how do we even know
I have a birth canal?

13:29.700 --> 13:32.400
What? I don't know anything about anything,

13:32.435 --> 13:34.000
other than the French horn.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.600
That your concert piece?

13:54.635 --> 13:57.200
Yeah. I keep messing up on this one phrase.

13:58.300 --> 13:59.600
Sounded good to me.

13:59.700 --> 14:01.700
<i>Breathe. Breathe.</i>

14:01.735 --> 14:04.200
<i>He's just a guy. He's just a guy.</i>

14:04.235 --> 14:05.900
You know what they say is helpful

14:05.935 --> 14:08.000
when you're nervous playing
in front of an audience?

14:08.700 --> 14:10.500
You should picture the audience naked.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.800
Ha. I don't think I could do that.

14:12.835 --> 14:14.200
I think it would make me more nervous.

14:14.235 --> 14:16.100
I didn't say you'd be naked.

14:16.300 --> 14:17.600
<i>He said "naked" again.</i>

14:18.500 --> 14:19.800
Go ahead, let me hear you play.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.400
I don't know. Heh.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.300
One, two,

14:28.335 --> 14:29.700
and, three, four.

14:29.735 --> 14:31.600
One, two.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.000
My lips are a little dry.

14:42.300 --> 14:45.000
They seem okay to me,
but I'll get you some water.

14:45.900 --> 14:48.800
Yeah. Water would be great. Thanks.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.500
You're really pretty, you know that?

14:58.500 --> 15:01.200
<i>He just kiss me.</i>

15:08.900 --> 15:10.200
Any news?

15:10.400 --> 15:11.300
News?

15:11.335 --> 15:12.600
The baby?

15:12.635 --> 15:14.100
Oh, no, not yet.

15:14.135 --> 15:15.900
I want to give this back to you.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.400
Why would you do that?

15:19.100 --> 15:20.400
Did you and Tammy break up?

15:20.435 --> 15:21.700
You wish.

15:21.735 --> 15:27.300
I asked her for it because
I think you are going to need it.

15:27.335 --> 15:28.400
Why would you say that?

15:28.435 --> 15:32.100
Tammy told me you had
a little problem at the shower.

15:32.135 --> 15:33.100
What problem?

15:33.135 --> 15:36.100
The Shawna problem.

15:36.135 --> 15:37.700
You're seeing Jack.

15:37.735 --> 15:39.300
No. No.

15:39.335 --> 15:42.300
Come on, you can tell me.

15:42.335 --> 15:43.700
There's nothing to tell you.

15:43.735 --> 15:45.800
That's what the ring is for.

15:45.835 --> 15:50.600
To make sure you never
have something to tell me.

15:50.635 --> 15:52.400
You didn't say anything to Dad, did you?

15:52.435 --> 15:55.400
Give me a little credit here.

15:55.435 --> 15:57.900
I'm talking to you.

15:58.200 --> 16:02.000
Not Dad.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.100
Jack already said he doesn't
want you to see anybody else?

16:10.135 --> 16:11.200
Uh-huh.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.000
And you said what?

16:13.200 --> 16:14.400
I'd think about it.

16:14.435 --> 16:15.700
Well, I'd like to think about it too.

16:15.735 --> 16:17.600
There. I've thought about it. No.

16:17.635 --> 16:19.800
It's a bad, bad, bad idea.

16:19.835 --> 16:21.800
So now you don't have to
think about it, okay?

16:21.835 --> 16:23.200
In fact, when it comes to dating,

16:23.235 --> 16:25.100
I'd be happy to do your thinking for you.

16:25.135 --> 16:27.100
Ha-ha. Dad, you're so funny.

16:27.135 --> 16:28.700
Yeah, and so are you.

16:28.735 --> 16:30.700
You're a funny girl, Gracie.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.700
Much too funny to even
consider just seeing one guy.

16:34.735 --> 16:36.500
Come on, You need to spread
the laughter around a little.

16:36.535 --> 16:38.700
Give other guys
the opportunity to take you out.

16:38.735 --> 16:40.800
Well, no other guys have asked me out.

16:40.835 --> 16:41.700
Just Jack.

16:41.735 --> 16:42.900
Come on. That can't be true.

16:42.935 --> 16:43.900
It is true.

16:43.935 --> 16:46.800
And I know you told Reverend Stone
to tell Jack to ask me out.

16:46.835 --> 16:48.400
What? No.

16:48.900 --> 16:52.400
No. Reverend Stone asked me
if Jack could ask you out.

16:52.435 --> 16:54.300
And, stupidly, I said yes.

16:54.335 --> 16:55.800
I thought he'd be a good starter date.

16:55.835 --> 16:57.700
But that doesn't mean
you have to keep dating him.

16:57.735 --> 17:00.600
I wanna keep dating him. I like him.

17:00.635 --> 17:02.000
I think he's cute.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.400
Have you kissed him?

17:06.599 --> 17:07.900
Dad!

17:07.935 --> 17:10.400
Let me ask the question a different way.

17:10.435 --> 17:12.099
Has he kissed you?

17:12.135 --> 17:14.500
I'm old enough to kiss a guy.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.300
So that's a yes?

17:16.335 --> 17:20.300
No, it's not a yes.
It's a no comment. It's private.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.300
Gracie,

17:21.500 --> 17:25.500
please give yourself a chance to
date other guys before you settle on just one.

17:25.535 --> 17:27.599
I'm not settling. He's a good one.

17:27.635 --> 17:31.000
Gracie, p-- Listen to me.
He's taking this way too fast.

17:31.035 --> 17:33.200
Look, if he keeps up this pace,
by the end of the summer,

17:33.235 --> 17:36.500
trust me, sweetheart,
he's gonna try to have sex with you.

17:36.535 --> 17:39.300
Dad. That's impossible.

17:54.000 --> 17:54.700
Hello?

17:54.800 --> 17:55.800
He Grace

17:55.835 --> 17:57.500
Hi, Ben. Is there a baby?

17:57.535 --> 18:01.100
No. Actually I just wanted to let you know
they don't think it's gonna be soon.

18:01.135 --> 18:02.200
Are they sending her home?

18:02.235 --> 18:03.700
It's gonna be sooner than that,

18:03.735 --> 18:06.200
but probably not in
the next couple of hours.

18:06.235 --> 18:08.000
Okay. Well, thanks for telling me.

18:08.035 --> 18:10.200
<i>You're on the list.
So when the baby's here,</i>

18:10.235 --> 18:12.200
<i>- I'll definitely call you.
- Okay, thanks, Ben.</i>

18:12.235 --> 18:15.500
Oh, and can you tell, um,
Amy that she's in my prayers?

18:15.800 --> 18:17.300
No. No. Don't tell her that actually.

18:17.335 --> 18:19.500
I don't know if she'd wanna
know I was praying for her.

18:19.535 --> 18:22.500
Tell her I'm thinking about her,
sending good thoughts her way.

18:22.800 --> 18:26.200
No, actually, that sounds like
I'm praying for her,can you just tell her--

18:26.235 --> 18:29.600
Actually, she said to ask you
to pray for her.

18:29.900 --> 18:33.300
Okay. Then I definitely will.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.300
Thanks, Grace. Bye.

18:35.335 --> 18:36.300
Bye.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.300
There you go. Thank you.

18:41.335 --> 18:44.300
If you need anything else,
I'm right outside.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.100
Oh. When do you think my dad's gonna get here?

18:47.135 --> 18:49.000
He's gonna wait until
George calls him.

18:49.035 --> 18:50.500
Okay. Thanks.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.400
You guys are doing that again?

18:58.700 --> 18:59.800
Yeah.

18:59.835 --> 19:01.500
You can't give it a rest tonight?

19:01.535 --> 19:03.600
We're in a hospital.
We don't wanna make noise.

19:03.635 --> 19:05.200
You're allowed to talk in here.

19:05.235 --> 19:06.700
But we don't want to.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.500
You guys are talking about me, aren't you?

19:12.800 --> 19:14.400
- No.
- Whatever.

19:14.435 --> 19:16.100
I'm gonna go take this to Amy.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Not yet.

19:19.700 --> 19:20.900
I'll let you know.

19:22.700 --> 19:24.000
Give us a minute.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.200
No.

19:40.800 --> 19:41.500
No?

19:41.535 --> 19:44.400
No. I am not gonna have sex with you.

19:44.435 --> 19:47.000
Not until, uh, 30.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.300
How many guys wait till
they're 30 to have sex?

19:50.700 --> 19:51.600
I'll have to look that up.

19:51.635 --> 19:54.400
I don't know the percentage of
30-year-old male virgins,

19:54.435 --> 19:55.800
but there are studies which claim men

19:55.835 --> 19:57.400
who lose their virginity at a later age

19:57.435 --> 19:59.600
can have dysfunction problems down the line.

19:59.635 --> 20:01.500
Great. Look, that's not what I asked.

20:01.535 --> 20:04.700
How many have sex at 30
who have never had sex before?

20:04.735 --> 20:07.500
Because if you're a virgin at 30,
chances are you're a virgin at 35,

20:07.600 --> 20:09.500
and 40, and 45.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.400
I don't know, I'd become a priest.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.910
You have to propose the question
in a scientific manner.

20:14.050 --> 20:16.000
You will not believe how good this feels.

20:20.488 --> 20:24.400
- Teeth.
- Yeah. Teeth.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.323
They look good. They did a nice job.

20:26.358 --> 20:29.380
Really? Uh, nice enough for me
to get a girlfriend?

20:29.489 --> 20:30.965
They only fixed your teeth.

20:32.301 --> 20:33.610
Yeah. Probably.

20:34.991 --> 20:37.100
I cannot wait for high school. Heh.

20:37.222 --> 20:38.700
It's gonna be so much fun.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.800
I, uh, heard you were looking for a burger.

20:46.900 --> 20:48.700
- Is that...?
- It's Kobe beef.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.600
- We had our chef make it.
- I don't want Kobe beef.

20:52.700 --> 20:54.500
- I want Dairy Shack burger.
- Oh.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.200
Ricky didn't say Dairy Shack.
He just said burger.

20:57.300 --> 21:00.500
- Uh, and come on. Dairy Shack?
- That's not even prime beef.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.300
I don't want prime beef.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.800
I want lousy, greasy, tasty, cheap beef.

21:05.100 --> 21:07.090
I want Dairy Shack.
Why can't anyone get me what I want?

21:07.110 --> 21:08.500
I'm trying to have a baby here!

21:08.700 --> 21:10.600
- Okay, I'll--
- Oh, no!

21:11.000 --> 21:12.300
Oh. Get my mom.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.590
Oh, this really, really hurts.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.100
I'm not-- I'm not very good with pain.

21:23.700 --> 21:25.500
- What happened?
- What do you mean what happened?

21:25.600 --> 21:28.300
I'm having another one of those
Ow. contractions.

21:28.500 --> 21:29.800
- Ben, are you okay?
- Mm.

21:31.500 --> 21:35.150
Ow. Oh. Hit the nurse button.

21:35.300 --> 21:36.900
Do I have to do everything?

21:38.700 --> 21:42.260
Oh, jeez, when are these
stupid contractions gonna stop?

21:42.300 --> 21:43.700
When the baby gets here.

21:51.392 --> 21:54.109
Mm! Oh, the Japanese know how to raise a cow.

21:54.310 --> 21:56.667
- It's Japanese?
- Yeah. Kobe, Japan.

21:56.759 --> 21:58.158
Would you two shut up?

21:58.800 --> 22:00.100
I can't enjoy my Dairy Shack burger

22:00.200 --> 22:03.300
if you two are talking about
cows and Japan and stuff.

22:03.700 --> 22:06.144
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

22:07.400 --> 22:10.222
What's wrong with me? I'm having a baby.

22:10.500 --> 22:11.600
That's what's wrong with me.

22:11.955 --> 22:14.100
It's not like it's a surprise.
You knew it was coming.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.400
Yeah, but I didn't know it was
coming with this much pain.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.700
It really, really, really hurts.

22:18.800 --> 22:19.900
Really? Heh.

22:20.300 --> 22:21.100
It's not funny.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.100
Come on,women have babies every day.

22:23.250 --> 22:25.600
There's a whole floor of women
right here having babies.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.000
Any of them 15?

22:27.200 --> 22:28.233
One of them's 13.

22:28.500 --> 22:33.900
Oh, that is just like you to try to
one-up me at a time like this.

22:34.840 --> 22:37.300
Actually, I'm lying.
I was just trying to make you feel better.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.800
Nothing can make me feel better right now.

22:40.700 --> 22:42.370
Except maybe a fripp.

22:42.405 --> 22:44.220
Isn't that how you got into this?

22:44.255 --> 22:47.700
A fripp is an apple fritter
without the gooey yucky middle part.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.600
Did you make that up or
does someone make a fripp?

22:49.800 --> 22:52.050
If you want, I'll get you one.
Tell me you want it. I will get it for you.

22:52.060 --> 22:54.777
I want one. I just said I want one.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.200
No one listens to me.

22:57.100 --> 22:58.400
Where do I get it? I don't know.

22:58.450 --> 22:59.964
Do you want me to go look it up?

23:00.000 --> 23:01.520
I don't understand what is wrong with everyone.

23:01.600 --> 23:04.400
Do I have to have a baby
and find where they sell fripps?

23:04.500 --> 23:06.020
You're just like your mother was,
you know that?

23:07.100 --> 23:09.900
She was so... unpleasant when she gave birth.

23:10.400 --> 23:13.100
Then they gave her that shot, and the quality
of my life improved a thousand percent.

23:13.600 --> 23:17.100
Are you going to sit there and
tell me stories about my mother

23:17.300 --> 23:19.150
when you could be doing something
to make your daughter,

23:19.200 --> 23:21.600
the girl she gave birth to, feel better?

23:21.635 --> 23:23.500
Oh, dear God. We'll get you a fripp.

23:24.220 --> 23:25.500
Just stop with all the drama.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.170
Oh, no, get Mom. Ow, get Mom.

23:28.190 --> 23:29.880
Hold my hand. Find your mother.

23:29.900 --> 23:33.250
Ow! Hurry! Hurry! Ow, baby, ow!

23:33.400 --> 23:35.200
- What are you screaming about?
- Your nails!

23:36.800 --> 23:38.400
- Oh, baby.
- Ow.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.440
I can't do this. I can't.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.810
Then-- Then don't, just don't.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.400
Daddy, help me.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.200
Aw, honey, I wish I could. I wish I could.

23:50.300 --> 23:52.100
I need Mom. It really hurts.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.400
Hold on. Ashley went to get you mother.

23:53.500 --> 23:57.310
It's gonna be okay, all right?
I promise you, everything is gonna be okay.

23:57.900 --> 24:00.600
Oh, sweetie... Yeah, uh-huh.

24:01.300 --> 24:04.250
Okay. I've got Mimsy.

24:04.500 --> 24:05.500
Mimsy? Where is she?

24:05.900 --> 24:08.300
- At her boyfriend's.
- Way to go, Mimsy.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.600
You know, Ashley has a boyfriend now too.

24:10.770 --> 24:12.900
No, no, no, that's over.

24:13.700 --> 24:16.300
Okay, well, I'll keep you posted. Okay, Mom.

24:16.700 --> 24:17.930
Yeah, I love you too. Bye.

24:19.800 --> 24:22.100
I don't think I'm gonna date until
I'm Mimsy's age.

24:22.500 --> 24:25.300
Did something happen with Thomas?
Something like...?

24:25.500 --> 24:29.246
Something like something that would make you
not want to date until you're Mimsy's age?

24:29.281 --> 24:32.630
Mom, it was like we were already married.
We were so comfortable with each other.

24:32.780 --> 24:33.900
And I don't want comfortable.

24:33.950 --> 24:35.600
- I want passion.
- Well, Ashley,

24:36.100 --> 24:39.200
passion is only temporary,
but babies last a lifetime.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.750
Remember that. okay.

24:42.800 --> 24:45.033
Your father and I were once quite passionate.

24:45.068 --> 24:48.500
Oh, Mom, watching my sister give birth
is enough for one day

24:48.600 --> 24:50.030
without hearing about you and dad.

24:50.200 --> 24:53.002
Okay. Oh, is your sister okay?

24:53.037 --> 24:55.866
Oh, yeah, she, uh, wants you.

25:04.764 --> 25:05.850
Aha, I found you.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.410
- I knew you were still taking classes.
- No, I'm not.

25:09.700 --> 25:12.800
- Then what are you doing?
- I'm having coffee with my friends.

25:12.900 --> 25:14.600
That's where you messed up.
You don't have friends.

25:14.800 --> 25:17.390
No, correction. I don't want any friends.

25:17.425 --> 25:19.900
It's okay by me.
I'm not a people person either.

25:20.400 --> 25:23.258
Dad, you're a salesman.
And not a very good one.

25:24.434 --> 25:28.053
-Let's just go.
-No, go ahead, spend the afternoon here.

25:28.088 --> 25:29.400
I'll come and get you in a couple hours.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.546
- Shouldn't you be at the store?
- Donovan's got it.

25:32.581 --> 25:35.400
Besides, someone asked me to help them move
a bunch of stuff this afternoon.

25:35.700 --> 25:38.070
- Someone?
- Yeah, this lady bought some stuff.

25:38.420 --> 25:39.800
and she wants to return some of it,
and I told her

25:39.988 --> 25:42.688
she probably just doesn't have it laid out
correctly. Ahem.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.860
- What?
- You're not a good liar either.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
If you want I'll cancel.

25:47.100 --> 25:49.600
You and I can hang out at the coffee shop.
Maybe you'll make a friend.

25:49.693 --> 25:51.300
I told you I don't want any friends.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.700
- And why is that?
- I don't know.

25:52.820 --> 25:55.530
I just-- I have a sense of impending doom.

25:57.500 --> 26:00.040
Don't forget to put your zombie makeup
back on when I pick you up.

26:00.200 --> 26:01.476
Your mother thinks you have friends.

26:01.511 --> 26:03.306
She also thinks you're drinking too much coffee.

26:05.100 --> 26:06.320
See you later, kitten.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.400
- Hi, George.
- So you're sneaking around teaching my kid?

26:10.720 --> 26:13.160
Well, there's sneaking around,
and there's sneaking around.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.100
Dance is the great escape, isn't it?

26:29.100 --> 26:31.800
- Hey, Ashley.
- Hey, Pops.

26:34.300 --> 26:35.850
I feel so bad for her.

26:36.900 --> 26:39.700
Well, they'll give her the shot eventually,
and that'll take the pain away.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.312
Of course, it won't take the baby away.

26:43.347 --> 26:45.530
I promise, I'm gonna help with the baby.

26:45.800 --> 26:49.900
I promise, if you don't,
I'll find you and I'll hurt you.

26:50.700 --> 26:53.300
You don't have to threaten me.
I'm gonna be a father to my son.

26:53.500 --> 26:56.528
I promise. All right, I get it.

26:59.700 --> 27:00.900
Do you know what she's gonna name him?

27:01.100 --> 27:03.100
Well, I don't think it's gonna be Ricky.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.090
Oh, jeez, I didn't think it would be Ricky.

27:05.130 --> 27:10.000
I was just wondering.
Are you this mean to Ben?

27:10.300 --> 27:12.719
Ben is not responsible for what happened here.

27:13.200 --> 27:16.390
Ashley, please be nice to me.

27:17.100 --> 27:20.500
every single person that comes to see Amy today
is probably gonna hate me.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.588
I need a friend.

27:22.623 --> 27:24.800
Can we just be friends?

27:26.000 --> 27:27.800
Are you even capable of being a friend?

27:39.700 --> 27:42.400
- You nailed it that time.
- Thank you.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.080
Sure, what are friends for?

27:44.500 --> 27:46.800
Oh, maybe he just wants to be friends.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.530
Yeah, what are friends for?

27:49.400 --> 27:51.400
You want me to walk you over
to the concert tonight?

27:51.800 --> 27:53.800
Sure. That would be very friendly.

27:54.100 --> 27:56.630
- I'm a friendly guy.
- Yeah, you are.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.370
But I'm not looking for a friend.

28:00.405 --> 28:01.530
I have a lot of friends.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.285
What I'm looking for is a girlfriend.

28:04.320 --> 28:09.809
He said girlfriend.
I know I heard him say girlfriend....

28:09.844 --> 28:11.170
Maybe you could be my girlfriend.

28:12.700 --> 28:14.300
We have a lot in common and--

28:14.600 --> 28:16.900
- We have music in common anyway.
- Yeah. Heh.

28:19.400 --> 28:22.700
-You okay? - I better be getting back
so I can get ready for the concert.

28:22.880 --> 28:24.300
All right, I'll walk you to your cabin.

28:24.500 --> 28:27.300
-OK.
-OK.

28:28.100 --> 28:29.100
Here, I'll take that.

28:29.500 --> 28:33.700
***

28:39.300 --> 28:42.500
***

28:53.200 --> 28:54.600
Still no baby?

28:55.750 --> 28:57.000
No, not yet.

28:58.100 --> 29:01.200
You know who might know the latest? Adrian.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.200
Maybe I will call her.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.350
No, no, no, you shouldn't call Adrian,

29:05.400 --> 29:07.000
because that will make Tammy jealous.

29:07.200 --> 29:08.400
I know that.

29:09.200 --> 29:12.000
Why, I think I will call Adrian to

29:12.400 --> 29:15.720
spice up my relationship

29:16.200 --> 29:19.500
with just a touch of jealousy.

29:19.700 --> 29:22.200
All right, I'll call Adrian,
but you can listen.

29:22.600 --> 29:23.900
Better than nothing.

29:30.600 --> 29:33.430
Did you hear anything? No, I was just
calling to see if you heard anything.

29:33.700 --> 29:35.400
Who's gonna call and tell me anything?

29:35.700 --> 29:39.968
- Ricky?
- He's hers now.

29:40.003 --> 29:44.115
Come on, he can love the baby
without loving Amy.

29:44.150 --> 29:47.900
No, my afternoon has been bad enough already.

29:48.300 --> 29:51.700
- Oh, your brother.
- Is in love with me.

29:51.900 --> 29:57.600
And I found out that I'm not
n love with my brother.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.550
But not before I slept with him.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.000
I should have insisted you
come out of that bedroom.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.100
I should have blown up the balloons.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.550
- What does that mean?
- What does what mean?

30:08.900 --> 30:10.600
What went on at the shower?

30:12.000 --> 30:13.400
Jack loves you, Grace.

30:14.200 --> 30:16.050
- Do you love him?
- I don't know.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.800
I mean, I have to admit, I have been
thinking about him a lot lately.

30:20.200 --> 30:21.300
Thinking about who?

30:24.050 --> 30:25.700
You know, Adrian, let's
just go to the hospital.

30:26.100 --> 30:27.400
Let's be there when the baby's born.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.100
We can't just go to the hospital.

30:29.170 --> 30:30.930
- We're not part of this.
- Yes, we are.

30:31.300 --> 30:32.400
We got her a job.

30:32.700 --> 30:35.875
We convinced Amy to stay in school.

30:35.910 --> 30:37.900
- You did all that.
- I did nothing.

30:38.100 --> 30:39.300
Well, Ricky will be there.

30:39.700 --> 30:41.900
- So?
- So Ricky will be there.

30:42.200 --> 30:44.700
- Am I gonna be there?
- No, you should be with Tammy.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.538
- She had a bad day.
- Come on let's just

30:47.573 --> 30:48.420
go there and hang out in the waiting room.

30:48.455 --> 30:49.900
I'm sure everyone else will be there too.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.800
No, no, you go.

30:51.900 --> 30:54.500
I can't, I don't have a car. I don't drive.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.500
Come on, girlfriend, let's just get in
your red convertible and go down there.

30:58.600 --> 30:59.900
I love that car.

31:04.800 --> 31:08.515
Just come down to the parking lot.

31:08.550 --> 31:11.330
- Meet who?
- Whoever your boyfriend is.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.500
Adrian, get out here, right now.

31:13.535 --> 31:15.039
Oh, are you kidding me?

31:15.200 --> 31:17.636
You're gonna start yelling at me now at 16?

31:17.671 --> 31:19.610
You never cared about what I did before.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.900
You never made me do anything before.
Why now?

31:22.200 --> 31:24.800
Look, if you don't get down here,
I'm gonna take this car back.

31:27.500 --> 31:30.100
- God.
- Okay, you have to go.

31:30.500 --> 31:33.000
- I wanna see the look on her face.
- No, you can't.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.900
But thank you for helping me make the deal.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.900
You know how these car dealers are with women.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.430
Yeah, I know. Salespeople, huh?

31:38.500 --> 31:39.336
Yeah. Heh.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.500
Okay, well, it's good seeing you.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.254
It's good seeing you too.

31:44.289 --> 31:46.400
- I had fun.
- I had fun too.

31:46.900 --> 31:48.600
If you need help, you know where to find me.

31:48.900 --> 31:50.170
Yeah, I know where to find you.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.100
- Bye.
- Bye, George.

31:55.200 --> 31:57.940
- Hope she likes it.
- Oh, I'm sure she'll like it.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.500
- Hope you like me.
- What?

32:01.000 --> 32:02.463
I hope you like me.

32:02.498 --> 32:05.200
- You're married.
- Yeah, but my wife, she doesn't like me.

32:05.900 --> 32:08.400
- Who couldn't like you?
- That's what I keep saying.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.400
- Okay, go, go, go.
- Call me, all right?

32:21.900 --> 32:23.100
Are you kidding me?

32:24.000 --> 32:25.700
No, I'm not kidding you.

32:26.200 --> 32:29.750
This is the car I always wanted,
so I wanted you to have it.

32:29.800 --> 32:32.882
- Can you afford this?
- Of course, I can afford it. I paid cash.

32:32.917 --> 32:34.800
And for the insurance. And don't wreck it.ok?

32:34.900 --> 32:37.400
Because all the money I have left is
going toward college.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.400
Mom, this is so crazy!

32:40.300 --> 32:43.600
Oh, crazy is a love a mother has for
her daughter.

32:57.500 --> 32:58.900
- Grace?
- Tom.

32:59.130 --> 33:02.100
Oh. Hey, Tom, how you doing, buddy?
Long time, no see.

33:02.400 --> 33:04.300
You kissed my sister.

33:04.700 --> 33:06.500
- What?
- I know you did.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.954
- This is not my day for brothers.
- What?

33:10.989 --> 33:13.100
I kissed her, all right? I miss her, Tom.

33:13.300 --> 33:15.400
Yeah, she miss you too.

33:15.800 --> 33:18.100
I heard her tell Adrian.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.900
- Oh, yeah?
- She is going down to the hospital.

33:21.300 --> 33:25.126
Amy is having a baby.

33:25.161 --> 33:26.900
-***
-Trust me.

33:27.300 --> 33:30.100
Have I ever steered you wrong?

33:30.500 --> 33:34.200
- Okay, maybe I will.
- Swing by and pick up me and Tammy.

33:34.400 --> 33:35.500
We wanna go too.

33:35.700 --> 33:37.374
All right. Hey, and thank you, Tom.

33:37.409 --> 33:39.400
No. Thank you.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.200
Hey, look who's here.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.900
Why don't you girls come in for a visit.

33:53.500 --> 33:54.700
Amy, I'll be right outside, okay?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.000
Just yell if you need me.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.100
Well, I need you. Don't leave.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.600
I just wanna let your dad and Ashley know
you're coming along, it's not gonna be long now.

34:01.800 --> 34:03.300
You said that a few hours ago.

34:03.550 --> 34:05.400
Is this a bad time?

34:05.800 --> 34:07.300
Is this a bad time?

34:07.400 --> 34:08.500
We could come back later.

34:08.699 --> 34:09.699
No, go on in girls.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.400
I'm just gonna take a short break. Go on.

34:16.100 --> 34:18.500
- Is it horrible?
- What do you think?

34:18.900 --> 34:20.699
Well, did they give you the drugs yet?

34:20.735 --> 34:22.199
The doctor just checked me.

34:22.600 --> 34:23.900
I'm not far enough along.

34:24.199 --> 34:26.000
Well, can't you just go home, then?

34:26.199 --> 34:28.600
Oh, no, I'm too far along to go anywhere.

34:40.800 --> 34:42.020
We saw Ricky.

34:42.699 --> 34:46.600
And Ben. And your dad. And Ashley.

34:47.699 --> 34:49.100
Henry and Alice are here too.

34:51.100 --> 34:52.300
They're not coming in here?

34:52.500 --> 34:54.300
Of course not. We're the only ones coming in.

34:54.600 --> 34:56.300
And-- And we don't have to stay.

34:57.400 --> 34:59.900
I've been doing this for hours.

35:01.200 --> 35:04.900
And it hurts, it really hurts.

35:05.900 --> 35:07.300
I'm so sorry, Amy.

35:07.700 --> 35:09.400
Is there anything we can do?

35:10.900 --> 35:13.000
Either one of you wanna have this baby for me?

35:15.100 --> 35:16.900
Look, listen and listen good:

35:17.400 --> 35:18.500
Do not have sex.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.200
This is what it leads to.

35:21.100 --> 35:25.800
Well, if you're not caref--

35:30.500 --> 35:34.050
So are there any cute doctors here? No.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.100
I was just trying to change the subject.

35:59.100 --> 36:01.400
- Hey, how was coffee?
- Fine.

36:03.500 --> 36:06.100
I can't wait until Amy gets back from band camp.

36:06.500 --> 36:08.400
It'll be nice to have someone
to talk to around here.

36:09.100 --> 36:12.600
You can talk to me.
You know, this, right here,

36:12.800 --> 36:15.600
- this is just part of the reason.
- Part of the reason what?

36:17.200 --> 36:19.100
Never mind. I have to go back to the store.

36:19.700 --> 36:22.800
- Now?
- We're doing inventory.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.800
The thing is, we don't wanna
give you the epidural too soon.

36:39.900 --> 36:41.300
Okay, I'm worried about too late.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.700
I've done this before, you know.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.600
I bet I know just about the perfect time.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.500
Yeah, well, I guess you do know better than me

36:47.600 --> 36:49.900
since I never went to that stupid, stupid class.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.100
Hey, that anger is good, useful energy.

36:52.200 --> 36:54.730
And it might speed things along.
You feel free to let it go.

36:55.100 --> 36:56.700
I'll let your mom know it's gonna
be a while longer.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.200
She didn't make me go to
that class when I should have.

36:59.400 --> 37:03.100
Yeah, just like that. Let it go. I'll be back.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.100
Ricky.

37:13.900 --> 37:17.000
See? Piece of cake. Lock is ancient.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.200
Come on in. It's okay.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.700
Well, I don't know. Are you sure
we should be in here?

37:23.800 --> 37:24.840
You're the one who wanted coffee.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.900
Well, I thought we could just buy a coffee.

37:27.100 --> 37:29.000
Nope. Nothing's open this time of night.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.300
I don't know how to make coffee, you know?

37:32.335 --> 37:33.400
I know how to make coffee.

37:33.900 --> 37:35.300
In fact, I could make you
a hamburger if you want.

37:35.400 --> 37:36.800
There's always hamburger meat in here.

37:37.900 --> 37:40.300
Well, I am a bit hungry. Ha-ha.

37:40.600 --> 37:43.501
- I was too nervous to eat before the concert.
- You were great.

37:43.536 --> 37:45.900
Well, you were such a big help this afternoon.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.600
Come on, let's cook something.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.700
I don't want you to get into any trouble.

37:50.200 --> 37:51.900
We're not gonna get into any trouble.

37:52.100 --> 37:54.318
We're just gonna have a little
late-night snack, right?

37:56.116 --> 37:57.374
Right.

38:00.878 --> 38:02.900
How about Mr. Sedlack? Is he nice?

38:03.000 --> 38:05.832
He's a little overenthusiastic
during marching season.

38:05.867 --> 38:09.100
He likes to make formations that really
require about a thousand students

38:09.200 --> 38:10.500
and we only have about a hundred.

38:10.800 --> 38:13.700
I'm not so sure how good I am at marching.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.900
You saw me this morning.
I made a complete idiot of myself.

38:17.800 --> 38:19.050
No, you didn't.

38:19.900 --> 38:21.230
You'll get the hang of it. It's fun.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.320
it seems like fun.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.900
So when you're not at band camp,
what do you do for fun?

38:30.800 --> 38:32.400
Um, hang out with friends.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.900
I've had the same two best friends
since the third grade.

38:35.200 --> 38:36.200
Lauren and Madison.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.560
They're going to Grant next year too,

38:37.620 --> 38:38.920
so I'm sure you'll be seeing them around.

38:40.700 --> 38:43.300
And, uh, my dad owns a furniture store.

38:43.700 --> 38:45.400
And my mom doesn't work. Well, she works,

38:45.600 --> 38:47.500
but she works at home, taking care of all of us.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.300
And then there's my sister, Ashley.

38:49.700 --> 38:51.900
Hm, she's 13. Heh.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.200
What about you? You have any brothers or sisters?

38:54.400 --> 38:56.200
No, only child.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.480
You wanna move over to the couch?

38:59.520 --> 39:01.830
This bench is getting a little uncomfortable.

39:03.600 --> 39:07.430
It's late. I should probably get back to
the cabin before anyone notices I'm not there.

39:07.600 --> 39:10.000
Come on, I really enjoy talking to you.

39:10.300 --> 39:12.500
I mean, there aren't
a lot of girls I can talk to.

39:17.100 --> 39:18.500
I took piano at first, but,

39:19.000 --> 39:21.300
I don't know, I just wasn't that
interested in the piano. It--

39:23.100 --> 39:24.100
Oh, no.

39:24.300 --> 39:25.700
Am I talking too much?

39:26.900 --> 39:29.300
No, I could listen to you talk all night.

39:30.100 --> 39:31.750
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:32.500 --> 39:33.900
Or we could do this.

39:41.100 --> 39:42.300
We could do that.

39:43.700 --> 39:45.300
I've never done that before.

39:45.826 --> 39:47.969
***

39:48.000 --> 39:50.339
Oh, yeah? I bet you'd be good at it.

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
- Making out.
- Oh, you do that a lot? Make out?

39:56.600 --> 39:58.020
I've made out with a few girls before.

39:58.100 --> 39:59.430
But not every girl I meet.

40:00.200 --> 40:01.300
Just if they're special.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
You're special, Amy.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.000
***

40:05.700 --> 40:08.320
I like you. I like you a lot.

40:08.500 --> 40:09.700
And we're going to the same school,

40:10.700 --> 40:14.300
and I thought, I don't know,
maybe you and I could be...

40:16.300 --> 40:19.000
Well, this could be the start of something big.

40:19.035 --> 40:22.042
***

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
I guess I should go now.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.938
***

40:34.973 --> 40:38.234
All right, if you want, I just thought
we were both enjoying this.

40:38.269 --> 40:41.700
Oh, yeah, it's just late.

40:41.900 --> 40:43.814
But you're enjoying this too, right?

40:45.100 --> 40:47.900
I mean, you feel the same way
about me as I feel about you?

40:51.100 --> 40:51.800
I think.

40:54.100 --> 40:55.600
Then what's a few more minutes?

40:56.400 --> 40:59.114
***

40:59.114 --> 41:02.320
Yeah, what's a few more minutes?

41:06.700 --> 41:07.500
Crap.

41:11.300 --> 41:12.200
Not you.

41:14.000 --> 41:14.800
Me.
