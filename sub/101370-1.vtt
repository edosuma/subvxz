01:23.886 --> 01:25.387
<i>Hello?</i>

01:25.421 --> 01:26.856
<i>Child, is that you?</i>

01:26.889 --> 01:28.923
<i>Yes, Father. I'm listening.</i>

01:28.957 --> 01:31.759
<i>I have great news.
Today you will strike.</i>

01:31.793 --> 01:33.061
<i>Get your team ready.</i>

01:33.094 --> 01:35.028
<i>And my target?</i>

01:35.062 --> 01:38.030
<i>Senator Bob Jeffers.
Make it messy.</i>

01:38.064 --> 01:40.566
<i>Our benefactors want
to cause an outrage.</i>

01:40.600 --> 01:42.134
<i>I will not fail you.</i>

01:42.168 --> 01:43.602
<i>Go with God.</i>

01:43.635 --> 01:45.804
<i>God is good.</i>

01:45.837 --> 01:49.940
BS! I call BS! BS! I call BS!

01:49.974 --> 01:53.443
Senator
Jeffers, stop the madness.

01:56.813 --> 01:58.714
Senator Jeffers,

01:58.747 --> 02:01.184
they're sending in
a Delta team to extract you.

02:01.217 --> 02:02.917
There's been a bomb threat.

02:02.950 --> 02:04.452
Really think you should
leave the interview.

02:04.485 --> 02:06.554
Would you look at that?

02:06.587 --> 02:08.922
- I got it. All right.
- Okay. Okay.

02:08.955 --> 02:10.789
You were saying, my dear?

02:10.824 --> 02:13.626
Aren't you nervous your
presidential platform could crumble

02:13.659 --> 02:17.462
if the U.S. Supreme Court votes
against the right to bear arms?

02:17.495 --> 02:20.765
That vote won't take place
till after the election.

02:20.798 --> 02:25.702
And when I am president of this
great United States of America,

02:25.736 --> 02:29.206
I will uphold individuals'
rights to bear arms.

02:29.239 --> 02:31.207
Now, that's a right
that was solemnly confirmed

02:31.240 --> 02:36.577
by the Second Amendment...
ratified in 1791, by the way.

02:41.681 --> 02:43.516
This is not a real car.

02:43.549 --> 02:45.450
Why'd they give us
this piece of shit?

02:45.484 --> 02:46.985
I feel like a damn clown
in this thing.

02:47.019 --> 02:49.755
You know what I think?
I think Mama fed you too well.

02:49.788 --> 02:52.224
Hey, I'm from Michigan. Us boys
like our cornbread, a'ight?

02:53.891 --> 02:55.825
Shit. Didn't mean to turn
the radio on, dude.

02:55.859 --> 02:59.162
I can't even hit the brake
without hitting the damn radio.

02:59.196 --> 03:00.763
Oh, you think that's funny?

03:00.796 --> 03:02.097
That's funny?

03:02.131 --> 03:04.766
That was my request.

03:04.799 --> 03:07.635
I wanted to see you
all cramped up in this thing.

03:07.669 --> 03:09.569
Yeah.
Yeah, this is ridiculous.

03:09.603 --> 03:11.705
Wait, wait, wait.
You're too tall, dude.

03:11.738 --> 03:13.940
- You're just too tall.
- Oh, yeah. You're real funny.

03:13.973 --> 03:16.243
You know, you're the reason why my
nuts are in my throat right now.

03:16.276 --> 03:19.544
Too bad. So apparently, this guy's
sitting in an interview right now.

03:19.577 --> 03:21.046
Okay. And?

03:21.079 --> 03:24.615
Question is, which one of us
gets to go in there

03:24.648 --> 03:26.817
and pull his crusty ass
out of the chair?

03:26.850 --> 03:29.018
Okay, well, you know what?
Seeing that you had your fun already,

03:29.052 --> 03:30.586
I'm thinking I should go in.

03:30.620 --> 03:32.622
Ah, nah. I'm gonna
flip you for it.

03:32.655 --> 03:35.791
No. Not doing that, bro.
I'm not doing that. Nah. Not doing it.

03:35.824 --> 03:38.025
- Too late.
- Hold it up. Hold it up. Let me see.

03:38.059 --> 03:39.827
- Call it.
- Heads.

03:40.795 --> 03:42.230
- Tails!
- Shit.

03:42.264 --> 03:43.730
Come on, man.

03:43.763 --> 03:45.031
- No, no, no.
- Yeah! Yeah!

03:45.065 --> 03:47.201
- All right. All right.
- Tails.

03:47.234 --> 03:50.069
You a cheatin' motherfucker,
you know that? You cheatin'.

03:50.102 --> 03:52.737
- Go have this one.
- Oh, I will.

03:57.774 --> 03:59.609
Enough is enough!

03:59.643 --> 04:01.144
Enough is enough!

04:01.179 --> 04:04.046
So I acknowledge, support,
and abide

04:04.080 --> 04:06.815
by our God-given right
of self-defense

04:06.848 --> 04:11.220
against any and all enemies,
be they foreign or domestic.

04:11.253 --> 04:14.088
You believe there's a domestic
threat I should worry about?

04:14.121 --> 04:16.689
You don't have to puddle-jump
to some godforsaken country

04:16.723 --> 04:18.091
to find someone
willing to kill you

04:18.124 --> 04:19.993
under the guise of revolution.

04:20.026 --> 04:22.894
Now, if it was up to me,

04:22.928 --> 04:25.830
I would arm every man, woman,
and child in this country

04:25.863 --> 04:29.633
who is a true patriot and
defender of our constitution.

04:29.667 --> 04:31.302
And I would strike first.

04:31.335 --> 04:33.837
Sir, we gotta go. Now.

04:33.870 --> 04:35.838
Oh. All right.

04:35.871 --> 04:37.307
- Now, as I was saying...
- We have a bomb threat.

04:37.340 --> 04:39.808
- Sir, we have to move. Let's go.
- All right.

04:39.842 --> 04:42.610
When this is over, I'd like
to see you again, though.

04:42.643 --> 04:46.046
Mm-hm. No. No.

04:47.148 --> 04:49.549
No, definitely not Benson.

04:49.583 --> 04:52.118
He's a pattycake.

04:52.152 --> 04:54.652
No, he's soft on security,
soft on crime.

04:54.686 --> 04:57.088
He's a
marshmallow son of a bitch.

04:57.122 --> 05:00.824
Couldn't win an election if
it hit him in the face, okay?

05:02.026 --> 05:04.162
Alrighty, now, I gotta go.
Bye.

05:12.301 --> 05:16.837
<i>...L.A. We recently
discovered a report of a bomb threat</i>

05:16.871 --> 05:18.772

05:18.805 --> 05:22.176

06:12.881 --> 06:16.117
Somebody want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

06:16.151 --> 06:17.352
Your name is on a list, sir.

06:20.422 --> 06:21.888
What list?

06:21.922 --> 06:24.024
A list of dead politicians.

06:26.659 --> 06:28.894
Bunch of assholes.

06:28.928 --> 06:31.397
Next time I want the nice car.

06:34.799 --> 06:38.403
Low profile.
We're rollin' low profile.

06:41.904 --> 06:43.240
John, remind me again,

06:43.273 --> 06:45.241
how long are we stuck
on this detail?

06:45.274 --> 06:49.412
Four days, three swing states,
two outdoor speeches.

06:49.445 --> 06:52.180
Yeah, and a partridge
in a pear tree.

06:52.214 --> 06:54.781
I knew better than to answer
your phone call.

06:54.814 --> 06:56.883
Pay's not bad.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.385
How's Shawn?

06:58.419 --> 07:01.154
Eh. He doesn't call much.

07:01.187 --> 07:03.989
He's busy with his... play.

07:04.022 --> 07:06.125
Ah. As in theater.

07:06.158 --> 07:07.758
Yep.

07:09.793 --> 07:11.027
Hello?

07:11.061 --> 07:12.330
Ahh! Damn!

07:12.363 --> 07:13.863
They're tracing your call!

07:13.896 --> 07:16.233
- Tracing who?
- Get off the phone!

07:23.271 --> 07:24.705
Let's move!

07:29.709 --> 07:31.878
Just get behind me,
and stay low.

07:41.819 --> 07:43.019
Aaah!

07:46.055 --> 07:47.191
Aaah!

07:49.459 --> 07:51.194
Keep moving!

07:57.331 --> 07:58.466
Aaaah!

07:58.499 --> 08:00.800
Get him out of here!

08:07.038 --> 08:08.407
Unhh!

08:10.041 --> 08:11.309
Unhh!

08:13.043 --> 08:14.345
Aaah! Unhh!

08:21.284 --> 08:22.717
Aaaah!

08:31.024 --> 08:33.159
Oh, shit! Unhh!

08:43.434 --> 08:45.436
All right, man, easy.
Easy there.

08:45.469 --> 08:48.206
Your man for the senator.

08:50.207 --> 08:52.142
Take the shot, Vic.
Take the shot, Vic.

08:52.175 --> 08:53.809
Let him go!

08:53.842 --> 08:57.379
Vic, take the shot.
Vic, take the shot.

08:57.413 --> 08:59.247
Vic, you take that goddamn shot!

09:01.982 --> 09:03.518
No, Vic!

10:57.641 --> 10:59.841
<i>The Supreme
Court has returned to their homes</i>

10:59.875 --> 11:02.178
<i>around the country to celebrate
Christmas with their families</i>

11:02.211 --> 11:06.047
<i>after four long weeks of hearing
the case of Connor vs. Harper,</i>

11:06.081 --> 11:08.483
<i>a case that directly impacts
the right to bear arms,</i>

11:08.517 --> 11:12.386
<i>and some say could change the Second Amendment forever.</i>

11:12.420 --> 11:15.121
<i>We expect to receive their
opinion shortly after the holiday.</i>

11:15.155 --> 11:16.389
Argh.

11:19.191 --> 11:22.628
Ohh. Damnit, not again.

11:22.661 --> 11:25.296
You sure you're up for this?

11:25.330 --> 11:26.930
Don't I look up for it?

11:26.963 --> 11:30.300
You really need
all that stuff?

11:30.334 --> 11:33.235
I'm not taking Shawn to the
cabin to sit for five days.

11:33.269 --> 11:35.438
Would that be so bad?

11:35.471 --> 11:39.574
What, so we can get in touch with
how well we don't know each other?

11:39.607 --> 11:42.476
You know, I also lost my mom
at a young age.

11:42.509 --> 11:45.379
It's not what he's doing
that's important.

11:45.412 --> 11:47.480
It's who he's doing it with.

11:47.513 --> 11:50.048
You really are my better half.

11:51.517 --> 11:53.318
Better two-thirds.

11:53.352 --> 11:55.220
- At least.
- Hmm.

11:56.620 --> 11:59.056
Do not forget to lock the house,
even during the day.

11:59.090 --> 12:00.091
I won't.

12:00.124 --> 12:01.092
And set the alarm.

12:01.125 --> 12:03.360
Okay. Will you call me?

12:03.393 --> 12:05.428
Uh, yeah,
but from Shawn's phone.

12:05.462 --> 12:07.162
Mine's acting kind of funny.

12:07.196 --> 12:09.231
Right.

12:10.199 --> 12:11.399
Bye.

12:40.155 --> 12:44.359
So how many Russians will
you find in South Africa?

12:44.393 --> 12:46.360
If you're asking me

12:46.394 --> 12:49.028
if you are like
any Russian I've met,

12:49.063 --> 12:50.996
you are one of a kind.

12:51.029 --> 12:53.433
You know how many South Africans
there are in Russia?

12:53.466 --> 12:54.600
How many?

12:54.633 --> 12:57.001
- Three.
- I believe it.

12:57.034 --> 12:58.303
It's too cold.

13:05.542 --> 13:08.412
Fencers ready. <i>Allez.</i>

13:17.419 --> 13:19.286
- Halt.
- Come on.

13:20.987 --> 13:22.623
Fencers ready.

13:22.656 --> 13:24.022
Yeah.

13:25.191 --> 13:26.259
<i>Allez.</i>

13:33.464 --> 13:36.100
- Gotcha.
- Come on.

13:36.133 --> 13:38.368
Yup. Okay.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.303
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Mm-hm.

13:40.336 --> 13:41.438
Fencers ready.

13:41.471 --> 13:42.604
Oh, yeah.

13:44.005 --> 13:44.972
<i>Allez!</i>

14:03.288 --> 14:04.389
Thanks.

14:04.422 --> 14:06.590
Lucky flick.

14:06.623 --> 14:09.326
Erin takes
the last round of the semester!

14:09.359 --> 14:11.527
- Good job, girl.
- Thank you. Thank you!

14:11.561 --> 14:13.563
That's it for class.
Have a good break, guys.

14:13.596 --> 14:15.764
What are you smiling about?
You lost.

14:15.797 --> 14:17.666
Did I, though?

14:17.699 --> 14:21.135
- All right, that'll be $85.
- Pay up.

14:21.168 --> 14:22.736
You cheated.

14:22.770 --> 14:25.438
No, I hustled you.
There's a difference.

14:28.041 --> 14:29.175
Pay the woman.

14:29.209 --> 14:30.509
Me?

14:30.542 --> 14:32.478
Yes. I'll get you back.
Come on.

14:32.511 --> 14:34.313
All right, people!
All right, let's go! All right.

14:34.346 --> 14:37.048
Okay, dorm is closed
for the holiday season

14:37.081 --> 14:39.749
due to construction,
so everybody out.

14:39.783 --> 14:41.485
Okay? I'm not saying
you gotta go home,

14:41.518 --> 14:42.552
but you can't stay here.

14:47.056 --> 14:48.123
Hey.

14:48.157 --> 14:49.524
Hey.

14:49.557 --> 14:51.392
Um, when's your dad
picking you up?

14:51.426 --> 14:53.294
Oh, Olivia said
he broke his phone,

14:53.328 --> 14:55.128
so I guess when he gets here.

14:55.162 --> 14:57.164
How about you?

14:57.197 --> 15:00.766
Oh, he's way too busy with his
opinion on the Second Amendment,

15:00.800 --> 15:02.535
so he's sending a driver.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.503
Right.
That's a really big deal, right?

15:04.536 --> 15:05.504
Yeah.

15:05.537 --> 15:07.038
Like world-changing.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.739
Do you pay attention
to anything?

15:08.772 --> 15:11.275
I, uh, I haven't talked
to him in a couple weeks.

15:11.308 --> 15:13.610
Hey! You three all packed up?

15:14.744 --> 15:16.379
All packed and ready to go.

15:16.412 --> 15:19.181
Yeah. I mean,
I'm like 80 percent there,

15:19.214 --> 15:20.716
but my car doesn't get here
till 6:00.

15:20.749 --> 15:23.784
5:00, Erin. 5:00 PM
is the last person out.

15:23.818 --> 15:25.520
All right, well,
I don't get to choose

15:25.553 --> 15:27.255
when the Secret Service
comes to pick me up.

15:27.288 --> 15:29.589
Okay, you get a minor exception,
all right, but you,

15:29.623 --> 15:32.158
- you're out, all right?
- Of course.

15:32.192 --> 15:33.626
Thanks. You're the best.

15:33.659 --> 15:35.060
Yeah, don't forget
to sign out with Charlie.

15:35.094 --> 15:36.195
- Uh-huh.
- Hey, Erin.

15:37.495 --> 15:40.498
Maybe I could call you
over the break?

15:40.532 --> 15:42.666
Sure, I guess.

15:42.699 --> 15:44.501
Cool.

15:44.535 --> 15:47.503
She's way
out of your league, bro.

15:47.537 --> 15:49.672
I mean,.

15:49.705 --> 15:52.707
Hey! 5:00 PM!
Out, all right?

15:52.741 --> 15:55.076
Not coming in. When you left,
you can't come back in.

15:55.110 --> 15:57.044
That's it.

16:11.789 --> 16:13.491
Hey, hon.

16:13.524 --> 16:15.326
<i>You're not there yet, are you?</i>

16:15.359 --> 16:17.594
No, this traffic is just
a nightmare...

16:18.628 --> 16:20.462
Watch it, dickhead!

16:20.496 --> 16:22.131
Sorry, sweetie.

16:22.164 --> 16:23.766
<i>Well, they closed
the dorm at 5:00.</i>

16:23.799 --> 16:25.767
<i>I told Shawn
you're running late.</i>

16:25.800 --> 16:29.604
Yeah, thank you. I'll call you
as soon as I get there.

16:29.637 --> 16:31.238
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

16:41.446 --> 16:42.814
Nice car.

16:45.182 --> 16:47.418
I'm here to pick up Erin Walton.

16:47.451 --> 16:49.319
I'm gonna need
to scan your license.

16:49.352 --> 16:51.554
- Do we need to do this every time?
- Nope.

16:51.588 --> 16:55.190
But you're not Ms. Walton's regular
driver, and we have protocol.

16:55.223 --> 16:58.160
- I'm impressed.
- I never forget a face.

17:06.733 --> 17:09.867
Make like Michael Jackson
and beat it.

17:09.902 --> 17:11.604
So I need a huge favor.

17:12.871 --> 17:14.539
No.

17:14.571 --> 17:17.275
Thing is, I have to catch
a flight to Calgary.

17:17.308 --> 17:18.775
Charlie.

17:18.809 --> 17:20.410
You don't have
to keep pretending

17:20.444 --> 17:22.346
your Canadian girlfriend
is real.

17:22.378 --> 17:24.847
Bro, do you want me to show you
the Instagram messages?

17:24.880 --> 17:27.749
No.
What do you need?

17:27.781 --> 17:31.453
So, I'm not supposed to leave
until everybody's signed out.

17:31.486 --> 17:36.724
And everybody's gone
except for you... and Erin.

17:36.757 --> 17:39.659
I see what you're doing,
and no, she's on ice, dude.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.860
If I do one more thing,
I'll come across desperate.

17:41.893 --> 17:44.763
"She's on ice"?
Bro, come on. You owe me.

17:44.796 --> 17:47.264
85 bucks.

17:48.566 --> 17:49.767
Okay. Fine.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.369
- Sweet. Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

17:51.402 --> 17:52.702
Just leave this with Neal
before you go.

17:52.736 --> 17:55.672
Sure.

17:55.705 --> 17:57.740
And don't cry when Erin
lets you down, man.

17:57.773 --> 17:59.642
Like, she's political royalty.

18:19.324 --> 18:20.391
Put the cane down.

18:29.798 --> 18:31.333
Who the hell are you?

18:31.366 --> 18:32.434
The driver.

19:02.358 --> 19:03.925
Hey.

19:03.958 --> 19:06.962
How's it going?
Um, I am here to check you out.

19:10.397 --> 19:13.700
I meant check you out
of your room.

19:13.733 --> 19:18.704
Right. Yeah. Um,
I need to finish packing and stuff, so...

19:18.737 --> 19:22.340
Well, you need to sign this.

19:22.374 --> 19:25.010
Yeah, we're actually the two last
people in the building, I guess, so...

19:25.043 --> 19:26.777
Should I be worried?

19:28.545 --> 19:29.779
Why?

19:32.614 --> 19:34.817
No reason.

19:34.850 --> 19:36.852
Okay.

19:36.885 --> 19:39.454
Mission accomplished, cowboy.

19:39.487 --> 19:41.855
Hm? Oh.

19:41.888 --> 19:43.690
- Right, the, uh...
- All of it.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.358
- The cowboy hat, right.
- Yeah.

19:45.392 --> 19:47.593
Uh, I'm actually
on the way to my cabin.

19:47.626 --> 19:49.829
Uh, it's, like,
in the woods.

19:49.862 --> 19:52.564
We have dirt bikes and horses and
a bunch of cool stuff like that.

19:52.597 --> 19:53.999
Oh, you have horses?

19:54.033 --> 19:56.366
Yeah. Yeah, two of them.

19:56.400 --> 19:58.769
I've never been
horseback riding.

19:58.802 --> 20:01.571
What?
Come on, never?

20:01.604 --> 20:03.040
No, never.

20:03.073 --> 20:04.941
Well, I mean...

20:04.975 --> 20:08.910
I don't know if you'd...
you'd want to, but I...

20:08.944 --> 20:11.846
I could, uh...
I could take you?

20:11.879 --> 20:13.581
Mayb... cool.

20:13.614 --> 20:15.348
- Sure. Yeah, maybe. Maybe.
- Maybe. Um..

20:15.381 --> 20:17.817
Yeah, here's this.
I have to finish...

20:17.851 --> 20:19.352
- I need to finish packing, so...
- Right.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.286
I'm just gonna go back
and do it.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.622
Uh, Erin, actually, I have
to make sure you leave safely

20:23.655 --> 20:25.289
before I can go.

20:25.323 --> 20:27.925
Okay, um...

20:27.960 --> 20:31.028
I just... I'm sure you have
something better to do

20:31.062 --> 20:33.663
than just sit here
and wait for me.

20:34.830 --> 20:37.333
No. I don't.

20:39.567 --> 20:42.670
Okay, well, um...

20:42.704 --> 20:45.305
maybe could you help me pack?

20:46.941 --> 20:50.343
Yeah.

20:50.376 --> 20:53.312
Sure. Yeah. Let's do it.

20:53.346 --> 20:54.813
- Great.
- Yee-haw.

20:54.846 --> 20:56.648
Giddyup, partner.

21:24.070 --> 21:25.604
Nice getup.

21:27.438 --> 21:28.873
Janitorial technician.

21:30.075 --> 21:32.442
Make sure our asset's
on her way out.

21:32.476 --> 21:33.544
Yes, sir.

21:52.159 --> 21:53.760
Campus is closed.

21:53.793 --> 21:55.628
I'm here to pick up my son.

21:55.662 --> 21:58.097
- Where?
- MacArthur Hall.

21:58.131 --> 22:01.566
Hm. Why don't you call your son,
have him meet you over there?

22:01.599 --> 22:03.534
Um...

22:03.568 --> 22:05.602
- My phone is...
- Ah.

22:05.635 --> 22:07.939
Eh, I'll tell you what,
make it quick, will you?

22:07.972 --> 22:09.773
Yes, sir.

22:09.806 --> 22:11.473
And you and your son, you have
a merry Christmas, sir.

22:11.507 --> 22:13.076
You do the same.

22:21.149 --> 22:22.783
One coming your way.

22:23.750 --> 22:25.852
Is he a problem?

22:25.885 --> 22:29.522
Nah, he's just here to pick up
his son. Should be quick.

22:29.554 --> 22:31.857
Okay, everyone stay loose
till this guy's gone.

22:33.625 --> 22:37.628
You were aware this dorm
has a perfectly good elevator?

22:37.661 --> 22:39.529
I don't do elevators.

22:39.562 --> 22:41.098
Childhood trauma?

22:41.131 --> 22:42.933
Claustrophobic.

22:42.967 --> 22:45.101
Oh, so repressed memory, then.

22:45.134 --> 22:48.403
What are you,
a psych major?

22:48.437 --> 22:51.106
No. Theater.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.446
- You got it?
- Yeah.

23:01.214 --> 23:02.748
We have the asset.

23:02.781 --> 23:05.717
Wow. Nice car.

23:05.750 --> 23:08.852
- Secret Service.
- Okay, okay. Pretty cool.

23:09.887 --> 23:11.855
Here, let me get that for you.

23:11.889 --> 23:13.957
I got this.

23:13.991 --> 23:15.658
Here you go, sir.

23:20.662 --> 23:22.563
Sorry.

23:22.596 --> 23:26.467
Um, well, thanks for
everything, and merry Christmas.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.036
- Yeah. Yeah, merry Christmas...
- Shawny!

23:29.069 --> 23:30.803
- Hey!
- How you doing, bud?

23:32.005 --> 23:34.908
Um, you should call me.

23:34.941 --> 23:37.808
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I will.

23:37.842 --> 23:40.946
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
- How you been?

23:40.979 --> 23:44.949
What's up?
Hey, you're good.

23:44.982 --> 23:47.750
You know, I'll take a few hours
late over not at all any day.

23:47.783 --> 23:49.485
Hmm. That hurt.

23:49.518 --> 23:50.619
Sorry.

23:52.620 --> 23:54.455
Is that your girl?

23:54.489 --> 23:56.857
Uh, no, it's Erin Walton.

23:56.890 --> 23:58.226
Walton.

23:58.259 --> 24:00.094
Yeah, Justice Walton's
daughter?

24:00.128 --> 24:02.495
Like Supreme Court
Justice Walton?

24:02.528 --> 24:04.231
Yeah, Dad.

24:04.264 --> 24:06.232
Where's Steve?

24:06.265 --> 24:07.866
- Sick.
- Oh.

24:09.902 --> 24:12.103
Shit. Hold on.
I'll be right back.

24:12.137 --> 24:15.072
- Hey, where you going?
- I'll be right back!

24:15.105 --> 24:16.974
- Wait, where you going?
- Oh, I-I forgot my laptop.

24:17.007 --> 24:20.009
The new guy's an ass, so...
I'll be quick, I promise.

24:20.043 --> 24:21.743
All right.

24:23.179 --> 24:25.180
Okay, so what's up?

24:25.213 --> 24:27.950
I, uh, I promised Charlie that
I'd make sure everyone was out,

24:27.983 --> 24:29.482
so I gotta... I gotta stay.

24:29.516 --> 24:32.719
Okay.

24:52.169 --> 24:54.904
The asset is on the move.
Heading to her room.

25:06.213 --> 25:08.181
Ready to do some ridin'?

25:08.214 --> 25:11.583
Uh, it's a little chilly,
nah?

25:11.616 --> 25:13.551
Fishing'll be good.

25:13.584 --> 25:14.852
Eh.

25:16.188 --> 25:17.955
Well, I know you want to shoot.

25:17.989 --> 25:19.823
- You love to shoot.
- I mean, I would, I just...

25:19.856 --> 25:22.524
got tryouts for the play
in a couple weeks, so...

25:22.558 --> 25:26.062
gotta start going over
the lines, get the part.

25:27.896 --> 25:29.831
What's the play?

25:29.864 --> 25:31.166
<i>Lost in Yonkers.</i>

25:31.200 --> 25:32.599
Ah, yeah, right, that's...

25:33.834 --> 25:35.836
It's Neil Simon.

25:35.869 --> 25:39.572
Neil Simon, uh,
is the guy who...

25:39.605 --> 25:42.074
Write. Writes.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.910
How's your bike holding up?

25:44.944 --> 25:46.277
Oh, good. Yeah, she's good.

25:46.311 --> 25:48.079
Needs a carb tune-up,
but, uh...

25:48.113 --> 25:51.148
Oh! Thanks for reminding me.
Gotta cover her up.

25:56.818 --> 25:59.322
So you're sure you're still
all in on this theater thing.

25:59.355 --> 26:02.257
Uh, yeah, Dad.

26:02.290 --> 26:04.692
If you'd actually been around
last couple years,

26:04.725 --> 26:06.160
you'd know I was good at it.

26:08.162 --> 26:10.196
I don't get to decide
when I come and go, Shawn.

26:10.230 --> 26:11.730
That's part of the deal.

26:11.764 --> 26:13.900
Yeah, Dad.
I know the deal.

26:13.933 --> 26:15.901
Don't get to choose.
Don't need it.

26:15.934 --> 26:18.037
All right? I'm fine.
Seriously.

26:47.659 --> 26:49.161
Your friend say
her driver's new?

26:49.194 --> 26:52.064
Yeah. So?

26:53.964 --> 26:55.665
Who's left inside?

26:55.698 --> 26:57.902
It's just the two of us.
We're the last ones in.

26:59.069 --> 27:01.037
Here. Take the keys,
get in the Jeep,

27:01.071 --> 27:03.038
lock the doors,
and do not move.

27:03.072 --> 27:05.606
Is something wrong?

27:05.640 --> 27:08.943
I don't know. Just chill.
I'll be right back.

27:10.311 --> 27:14.181
Chill.
"Just chill." Chill.

27:14.214 --> 27:16.249
Who taught him that word?

27:20.718 --> 27:23.620
Papa Bear's headed inside.
Keep your eyes on him.

27:33.062 --> 27:35.865
Yo, Charlie.
What up?

27:37.199 --> 27:38.799
Yeah, I told you.

27:38.833 --> 27:40.368
Can't just come on that strong.

27:40.402 --> 27:42.903
Gotta let her cool off
a little bit.

27:49.675 --> 27:50.876
God, you scared me.

27:50.909 --> 27:55.013
Sorry. Did you say
your driver was new?

27:55.047 --> 27:56.981
Yeah. Why?

27:58.382 --> 28:00.716
Maybe we should call your dad
and make sure.

28:00.749 --> 28:02.785
Got your phone?

28:02.818 --> 28:04.221
Yeah.

28:07.189 --> 28:12.127
Shawn said you're
a Green Beret? Delta Force?

28:12.160 --> 28:14.129
Yeah, I am.
Make the call.

28:18.465 --> 28:20.366
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Daddy?

28:20.399 --> 28:24.070
Erin. I thought you'd be here
by now. Where are you?

28:24.103 --> 28:26.104
<i>Well,
I had a lot to pack.</i>

28:26.138 --> 28:28.039
She's called her father.

28:28.073 --> 28:30.207
<i>Kill the call now.</i>

28:30.241 --> 28:31.942
<i>We have dinner
reservations at 9:00.</i>

28:31.976 --> 28:33.444
<i>When will you be home?</i>

28:33.477 --> 28:35.711
Before then, I guess.

28:35.744 --> 28:38.148
Hey. Can you ask
about the driver?

28:39.414 --> 28:44.051
Sure. Um, Dad, uh,
did you send a new driver?

28:44.085 --> 28:46.154
<i>A new what?</i>

28:46.187 --> 28:47.754
Driver.

28:47.787 --> 28:48.855
<i>No.</i>

28:50.789 --> 28:52.125
The call dropped.

28:52.159 --> 28:54.960
I know. I know.
That whole class was B.S.

28:56.495 --> 28:59.663
Hello? Charlie.

29:13.341 --> 29:14.843
Well, what did he say?

29:14.876 --> 29:16.244
He said no.

29:16.278 --> 29:18.245
<i>Kill the lights.</i>

29:26.919 --> 29:28.453
- Get down.
- What?

29:28.487 --> 29:29.855
Get down now.

29:29.888 --> 29:31.856
Oh. Okay.
What is going on?

29:53.974 --> 29:57.776
Okay. Follow close
and avoid the windows.

29:59.011 --> 30:01.112
- What about my bag?
- Leave it.

30:11.020 --> 30:13.456
That's strange. Erin just
called asking about her driver.

30:13.489 --> 30:15.424
And?

30:15.457 --> 30:17.492
The line went dead.

30:17.526 --> 30:21.495
Promise me you're not going to
ruin another holiday season.

30:21.529 --> 30:23.331
Me?

30:23.364 --> 30:26.366
The both of you need to leave
your politics at the office.

30:26.399 --> 30:28.535
I'm calling again.

30:28.568 --> 30:31.537
Probably met a boy with dozens
of tattoos and fell in love.

30:31.570 --> 30:34.305
I am not playing referee
this holiday.

30:34.339 --> 30:35.940
Voicemail.

30:35.974 --> 30:37.442
Her battery is dead.

30:37.475 --> 30:39.343
Have you finished
your opinion?

30:39.376 --> 30:41.144
I'm undecided.

30:41.178 --> 30:44.013
This is not a time
for neutrality.

30:44.046 --> 30:46.816
You pick a side,
and you stand by it.

30:56.223 --> 30:57.424
Dad?

31:08.399 --> 31:10.268
Ma'am.

31:11.569 --> 31:13.303
Yoo-hoo!

31:20.242 --> 31:22.243
The asset is gone.

31:22.277 --> 31:25.480
Move in now. Contingency Delta.
Full extract.

31:36.955 --> 31:38.590
There's
a structural interference.

31:38.623 --> 31:40.425
Wait. They're on level four.

31:42.226 --> 31:44.828
<i>Acquire the package.</i>

31:44.862 --> 31:47.030
<i>Create rows.
Maintain a perimeter.</i>

31:47.063 --> 31:48.264
<i>No one in or out.</i>

31:48.298 --> 31:50.333
What about Papa Bear
and Baby Bear?

31:50.366 --> 31:52.467
Expendable.

31:52.501 --> 31:55.203
<i>Now we have
ourselves a little party.</i>

31:55.237 --> 31:57.071
<i>How excitin'.</i>

31:57.104 --> 32:00.307
<i>Stay on target.
We have a job to do.</i>

32:02.375 --> 32:04.177
All right, come on.

32:04.210 --> 32:05.411
Stay low.

32:06.478 --> 32:07.880
Come on.

32:10.415 --> 32:13.418
Okay. I'm gonna need you
to stay right with me,

32:13.451 --> 32:15.085
like step for step.

32:15.118 --> 32:18.021
We're gonna move quickly
and quietly, okay?

32:18.055 --> 32:19.955
Okay.

32:22.258 --> 32:24.126
Dad?

32:24.159 --> 32:27.429
<i>Is everything all right, Ms.
Walton?</i>

32:27.462 --> 32:29.296
Fine.

32:29.330 --> 32:31.965
<i>Do you need help
finding your laptop?</i>

32:31.999 --> 32:34.167
Nope. I'm good.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.903
<i>We're running a little
behind schedule.</i>

32:36.936 --> 32:40.572
Actually, I'm not on
any particular schedule.

32:40.605 --> 32:42.007
<i>Beg your pardon?</i>

32:42.040 --> 32:43.641
Not to be a bitch,
but I don't remember

32:43.674 --> 32:45.476
telling you that I needed
to be anywhere

32:45.509 --> 32:46.977
at any certain time.

32:47.011 --> 32:50.980
I see subterfuge
is pointless.

32:51.014 --> 32:52.981
Put the asshole on the phone.

32:53.015 --> 32:54.216
<i>Now.</i>

32:58.986 --> 33:00.355
Yeah?

33:00.388 --> 33:03.090
You've become
quite an obstacle, mister.

33:03.123 --> 33:05.158
But we're working on that.

33:05.192 --> 33:07.060
But I can assure you,
you're surrounded

33:07.094 --> 33:09.161
by a team of highly
trained operatives.

33:09.195 --> 33:12.497
<i>All signals... wi-fi, radio, CB...
have been jammed.</i>

33:12.530 --> 33:15.133
<i>I'm giving you five minutes
to exit the building.</i>

33:15.166 --> 33:17.067
<i>It may not seem like
an act of kindness,</i>

33:17.101 --> 33:20.938
<i>but I promise you,
it most certainly is.</i>

33:20.971 --> 33:23.139
You should have had your
package and been out in two.

33:23.172 --> 33:25.341
Fuckin' amateur.

33:27.109 --> 33:29.010
What'd he say?

33:29.044 --> 33:31.179
We gotta get you
out of here.

33:31.213 --> 33:32.413
Okay.

33:40.320 --> 33:41.620
Excuse me, sir.

33:41.653 --> 33:44.123
Uh, have you seen, like,
a middle-aged guy

33:44.156 --> 33:47.325
around here, bad clothes,
doesn't smile much?

33:47.358 --> 33:49.160
Ring a bell?

33:49.193 --> 33:51.161
Sorry, bubba.

33:51.194 --> 33:53.563
But I can help you look
if you like.

33:53.597 --> 33:56.699
Oh, no, that's okay. I don't want to
take you away from your work or anything.

33:56.732 --> 33:59.602
- Don't worry about it.
- Work's not going anywhere.

33:59.635 --> 34:01.202
Cool.

34:01.236 --> 34:02.704
Sorry about this.

34:02.737 --> 34:05.172
You probably must be
antsy to get out of here.

34:06.740 --> 34:10.376
You know, bubba,
I mean, I can't complain.

34:10.409 --> 34:12.378
Guess if I would have
gone to college like you,

34:12.411 --> 34:15.246
maybe I'd be a big shot,
not a toilet scrubber.

34:15.280 --> 34:16.681
Know what I'm sayin',
bubba?

34:16.715 --> 34:19.117
Yeah. I guess.

35:21.800 --> 35:25.636
Goddamn it, Shawn,
I told you to wait in the car!

35:27.270 --> 35:28.773
You know, one of these days,

35:28.806 --> 35:31.373
you're gonna realize
when I tell you to do something,

35:31.407 --> 35:33.576
I'm not sayin' it
just to hear myself ta...

35:33.609 --> 35:35.211
What?

35:36.812 --> 35:39.614
You just killed that guy?

35:39.647 --> 35:41.415
He was gonna kill <i>you.</i>

35:42.449 --> 35:43.650
Look, he's not dead.

35:45.085 --> 35:46.219
Ohh.

35:57.495 --> 35:59.196
Let's go.

35:59.230 --> 36:00.363
Okay.

36:04.834 --> 36:06.435
All right, go on, go.

36:35.224 --> 36:37.527
Justice Walton.
Pardon me, sir.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.461
Director Phillips is here.

36:39.494 --> 36:43.064
He says it's very urgent
to speak with you.

36:43.097 --> 36:44.231
Show him in.

36:44.265 --> 36:45.466
Very good.

36:47.735 --> 36:50.637
Do you think this has anything
to do with the decision?

36:50.670 --> 36:52.205
Probably.

36:52.238 --> 36:54.306
Ohh. That poor man.

36:59.410 --> 37:01.379
- Thank you. Eva.
- Hi, Mike.

37:01.412 --> 37:04.381
Ken. Terribly sorry
to intrude like this.

37:04.414 --> 37:06.116
Aw, merry Christmas.

37:06.149 --> 37:08.384
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

37:08.417 --> 37:11.420
A man carrying a bottle of
Macallan's is never an intrusion.

37:11.453 --> 37:12.855
Grab a cue.

37:12.888 --> 37:14.489
Guests always break.

37:16.424 --> 37:18.425
Well, it's been quite a while.

37:18.458 --> 37:21.094
I'm not sure if I remember
how this goes, but...

37:22.328 --> 37:24.765
I'll give it
the old college try.

37:29.769 --> 37:31.268
Lucky shot.

37:31.302 --> 37:33.404
You're not the first shark
at my table.

37:33.437 --> 37:35.506
Well, get to it.

37:35.539 --> 37:38.508
I'm guessing you didn't fly in from
Washington just to keep me company.

37:40.143 --> 37:42.411
Your opinion.

37:42.444 --> 37:44.646
Is it done?

37:44.680 --> 37:46.314
I have a draft.

37:46.347 --> 37:47.715
You want to see it?

37:51.418 --> 37:52.887
Yes, I-I would.

37:52.920 --> 37:55.254
Maybe we should
play by the rules.

37:57.590 --> 37:59.358
Hi. Cheers.

37:59.391 --> 38:00.592
Thank you.

38:00.625 --> 38:02.226
Thank you, darling.

38:07.631 --> 38:11.267
To better,
more responsible times.

38:11.300 --> 38:13.302
I'll drink to that.

38:19.373 --> 38:22.309
Listen, Ken,

38:22.343 --> 38:24.310
have you ever read

38:24.344 --> 38:26.613
<i>Those Who Walk Away
from Omelas?</i>

38:26.646 --> 38:29.381
It's a short story
by Ursula Le Guin.

38:29.414 --> 38:32.117
Can't say that I have.

38:34.585 --> 38:37.188
There's this town, Omelas,

38:37.221 --> 38:38.588
where everybody's happy.

38:41.691 --> 38:43.492
Not happy.

38:43.525 --> 38:45.494
Ecstatic.

38:45.527 --> 38:47.496
There's no soldiers,
no kings,

38:47.529 --> 38:50.665
no inequality.

38:50.698 --> 38:52.433
It's a Utopia.

38:54.869 --> 38:56.838
And... well,
there's no monsters

38:56.871 --> 39:00.473
who walk into preschools
with assault rifles.

39:04.777 --> 39:05.911
But there's a catch.

39:05.945 --> 39:08.847
In order for this...

39:08.880 --> 39:13.751
Utopia to exist,

39:13.784 --> 39:16.452
an atrocity
has to be committed.

39:18.320 --> 39:21.223
This is part of the deal.

39:21.256 --> 39:23.324
Some of the townspeople
go along with it,

39:23.357 --> 39:24.659
and some don't.

39:25.693 --> 39:28.328
And what is it
they have to do?

39:31.898 --> 39:33.699
They have to hurt a child.

39:41.405 --> 39:43.908
I have your daughter, Ken.

39:43.941 --> 39:45.408
I have Erin.

39:45.441 --> 39:48.779
If you don't do
what I tell you to do...

39:50.813 --> 39:53.248
something terrible
will happen to her,

39:53.281 --> 39:55.449
and it will be your fault.

40:01.722 --> 40:03.489
It's your shot.

40:05.390 --> 40:07.225
Go, go, go.

40:07.259 --> 40:08.393
Get down, get down.

40:10.361 --> 40:12.296
All right. I've got
to find a landline.

40:12.329 --> 40:14.297
There's people I can call
in a situation like this.

40:14.330 --> 40:15.933
There's a payphone
in the gym.

40:15.966 --> 40:17.968
You sure? I've never seen
a payphone in there before.

40:18.002 --> 40:20.402
Yes! Freshman year,
we had a petition to get...

40:20.436 --> 40:22.671
Guys, guys!
That's where I'm headed.

40:22.706 --> 40:24.006
Give me your cell phones.

40:24.039 --> 40:26.674
- Why?
- 'Cause they're tracking them.

40:26.709 --> 40:29.342
How do you know?

40:29.376 --> 40:30.577
Sorry.

40:33.814 --> 40:35.481
- All right...
- Dad!

40:35.514 --> 40:36.850
- We're going with you.
- No, no.

40:36.883 --> 40:38.018
These people
are highly trained.

40:38.050 --> 40:39.384
Yeah, well, so am I.

40:39.417 --> 40:40.986
Well, then take this.

40:41.020 --> 40:42.420
Here.

40:43.587 --> 40:44.756
You guys stay out of sight,

40:44.789 --> 40:47.758
listen for sound,
but do not engage.

40:47.791 --> 40:49.893
They need Erin alive, but you and
I, they'll shoot on sight.

40:49.927 --> 40:52.029
- Okay, we won't go anywhere.
- Yeah, we'll stay hidden.

40:52.062 --> 40:53.495
- Okay.
- Dad.

40:53.528 --> 40:55.263
You're gonna need this.

40:56.833 --> 40:58.265
It's a payphone.

40:58.299 --> 40:59.835
Yeah.

40:59.868 --> 41:02.469
Here. I'll be
back for mine.

41:12.343 --> 41:14.780
Cellphone GPS says
they're on the elevator

41:14.813 --> 41:16.380
heading to the ground floor.

41:16.413 --> 41:17.982
<i>I'm on it.</i>

41:43.368 --> 41:45.503
This kid thinks he's smart.

41:49.974 --> 41:51.541
Smarter than you.

41:54.377 --> 41:56.780
Let's take a ride.

42:03.417 --> 42:04.451
On your knees!

42:10.123 --> 42:13.492
Put the cuffs on,
put your hands over your head.

42:13.526 --> 42:15.493
Now!

42:26.369 --> 42:28.105
Paula,
how we lookin' up top?

42:28.138 --> 42:30.505
Dead still, baby.

42:30.539 --> 42:32.809
They're zipped up tight.

42:36.443 --> 42:38.411
<i>Babcock,
what's your 20?</i>

42:38.444 --> 42:39.814
I'm playing hide-and-seek.

42:44.884 --> 42:47.352
<i>Rodriguez, report.</i>

42:47.386 --> 42:49.453
<i>Rodriguez, report.</i>

42:49.487 --> 42:51.857
<i>Driver,
you gotta see this!</i>

43:06.534 --> 43:08.002
All ears, listen up.

43:08.036 --> 43:11.438
<i>His name is Major Vic Davis.</i>

43:11.471 --> 43:13.539
<i>Green Beret at 21,</i>

43:13.573 --> 43:15.474
<i>Delta Force
a few years later.</i>

43:15.508 --> 43:17.743
<i>He's seen action
all over the world...</i>

43:17.777 --> 43:19.946
<i>Bosnia, Somalia, Kosovo.</i>

43:19.979 --> 43:22.047
If there was a major conflict
in the last 15 years,

43:22.080 --> 43:23.748
this guy was there.

43:23.782 --> 43:26.583
<i>He's the current
Delta One team leader.</i>

43:26.616 --> 43:29.687
<i>In Somalia, his confirmed
kill count was over 50.</i>

43:29.720 --> 43:32.755
<i>Deadly, and he will not
hesitate to kill you.</i>

43:32.789 --> 43:34.423
Did you know all that?

43:36.490 --> 43:37.525
Nope.

43:39.094 --> 43:43.097
I don't care who you are.

43:44.966 --> 43:46.700
You're dead.

44:01.510 --> 44:04.047
They seem really
nervous about it.

44:05.181 --> 44:06.849
Yeah.

44:06.883 --> 44:08.084
Yeah, they should be.

44:15.055 --> 44:18.058
Oh, my gosh. Shawn,
you're bleeding a lot.

44:18.092 --> 44:20.660
- It's not that bad.
- No, no, we need to get this wrapped up.

44:20.693 --> 44:22.461
- I-I'll be okay.
- No, it's bad.

44:22.494 --> 44:24.196
It's not... it's not
that bad. I'll be okay.

44:24.229 --> 44:26.665
No. Come on.

44:26.698 --> 44:28.733
Let's find something.
We'll wrap you up.

44:30.134 --> 44:32.003
Hey, this is Vic.

44:32.036 --> 44:33.870
I've got a domestic terror
situation,

44:33.904 --> 44:35.872
Macarthur Hall,
Johnson College.

44:35.906 --> 44:37.973
They're everywhere.

44:38.007 --> 44:41.143
<i>Major Davis,
I'm hardly paramilitary.</i>

44:41.176 --> 44:43.811
<i>Try harder.</i>

44:43.845 --> 44:48.215
- CIA? Ground Branch?
- <i>Good guess.</i>

44:48.248 --> 44:51.785
<i>Now do you understand what
you've gotten yourself into?</i>

44:51.818 --> 44:53.786
<i>I give you this
one-last-time offer</i>

44:53.819 --> 44:56.155
<i>to leave
and never look back.</i>

44:56.188 --> 44:57.621
<i>Take it.</i>

44:57.656 --> 44:58.790
No.

45:22.876 --> 45:24.878
This is my way, you bitch.

45:48.697 --> 45:50.130
Fuck! Stop!

46:24.257 --> 46:26.226
Does that hurt?

46:26.259 --> 46:29.795
But... go ahead.

46:33.965 --> 46:36.533
We used to go
to the cabin all the time.

46:36.567 --> 46:38.268
You know, it was
kind of like our thing.

46:38.302 --> 46:41.071
Mixed martial arts,
hand-to-hand,

46:41.105 --> 46:44.007
sharpshooting, dirt-biking.

46:45.975 --> 46:47.776
It's kind of like
what my dad's best at.

46:47.809 --> 46:49.011
That's cool.

46:50.212 --> 46:51.913
And I really loved it, too.

46:51.947 --> 46:54.615
Not what we were doing,
just...

46:54.648 --> 46:56.650
just that we did it together.

46:56.684 --> 47:00.120
So, uh, are your parents
together, then,

47:00.153 --> 47:02.988
or... where's your mom at?

47:04.256 --> 47:05.657
Sorry.

47:11.995 --> 47:14.064
Some asshole from Iraq...

47:17.199 --> 47:20.669
he wanted revenge
for something my dad did.

47:20.703 --> 47:21.903
And, um...

47:25.006 --> 47:26.874
they found our house.

47:27.941 --> 47:29.743
But I was at school.

47:29.777 --> 47:31.177
And, um...

47:34.614 --> 47:36.681
...he killed her.

47:40.718 --> 47:41.919
God damn.

47:45.321 --> 47:46.790
So, my dad

47:46.823 --> 47:48.992
stopped coming home so much,

47:49.025 --> 47:54.196
and, uh, I started to live with
a lot of military families.

47:55.396 --> 47:56.998
And then I went to college.

47:59.800 --> 48:01.935
We haven't spent much
time together since she...

48:05.771 --> 48:08.340
Shawn, I'm so sorry.

48:09.307 --> 48:10.708
Yeah.

48:15.245 --> 48:16.947
Thank you.

48:19.082 --> 48:20.716
For what?

48:21.751 --> 48:23.852
You waited for me.

48:26.154 --> 48:27.656
<i>I find nothing.</i>

48:27.689 --> 48:30.024
<i>No asset. Nothing.</i>

48:30.057 --> 48:32.126
Keep sweeping, all floors.

49:03.951 --> 49:07.420
Be realistic, Erin.

49:07.453 --> 49:09.789
If you come out now,

49:09.822 --> 49:12.357
we will let your friends go.

49:14.459 --> 49:16.360
Keep resisting...

49:17.695 --> 49:20.231
and we will
have to kill them.

49:22.265 --> 49:24.901
You are not that selfish.

49:25.934 --> 49:27.236
Are you?

49:31.973 --> 49:34.675
Stay the fuck away from me.

49:34.709 --> 49:36.710
Hello, sweetheart.

49:54.891 --> 49:55.925
The gun!

50:00.362 --> 50:02.063
Hey!

50:08.935 --> 50:12.138
This is why...

50:12.172 --> 50:15.040
you don't interfere...

50:15.073 --> 50:17.109
in other people's...

50:17.142 --> 50:19.944
Aaaahhhh!

50:19.977 --> 50:21.245
Ohh!

50:22.980 --> 50:24.314
Stupid <i>suka!</i>

50:30.319 --> 50:31.387
Hey!

50:34.355 --> 50:35.990
Let her go...

50:36.024 --> 50:37.392
or I'll kill you.

50:41.929 --> 50:43.129
Fucking do it!

50:44.230 --> 50:48.934
Think real hard, little boy.

50:54.905 --> 50:57.974
Once you cross that line...

51:00.877 --> 51:03.345
...there ain't no goin' back.

51:10.851 --> 51:11.885
Come on.

51:11.918 --> 51:13.954
- Hold this. You okay?
- Yeah.

51:13.987 --> 51:15.355
Let's go, come on.

51:20.992 --> 51:23.461
They'll declare my judgment was under
duress, and they'll toss it out,

51:23.494 --> 51:25.429
doing you a damn bit of good.

51:25.462 --> 51:30.100
My daughter didn't have a choice
when that monster shot her.

51:30.133 --> 51:33.202
But you have a choice
tonight, Ken.

51:33.236 --> 51:35.270
I just hope you make
the right one.

51:37.072 --> 51:40.541
You deviate from my
instructions just once,

51:40.575 --> 51:42.109
and Erin dies.

51:42.142 --> 51:43.344
You got it?

51:44.811 --> 51:47.080
Don't fuck with me, Ken.

51:47.113 --> 51:49.414
I didn't get to be
Director of the CIA

51:49.448 --> 51:52.784
without making sacrifices.

51:52.818 --> 51:55.186
Even men like you
can disappear.

51:58.122 --> 52:00.824
This'll be our
dirty little secret.

52:07.463 --> 52:09.197
There, there, there, there.

52:09.230 --> 52:11.866
Shit. Damn it! Come on!

52:11.899 --> 52:13.934
It's open!
Go in! Go, Erin!

52:31.482 --> 52:33.249
- Shawn?
- Yeah.

52:34.217 --> 52:35.818
I'm really scared.

53:10.246 --> 53:13.214
Papa Bear is on
the north side of the dorm.

53:16.383 --> 53:18.886
<i>Visual acquired.
Copy that.</i>

53:18.919 --> 53:22.455
<i>Paula, engage and eliminate.</i>

53:22.488 --> 53:25.191
I don't have a shot.
There's a fuckin' tree!

53:25.224 --> 53:27.159
<i>Krieg, Rose, move it!</i>

53:31.962 --> 53:34.165
<i>Do you have a shot?</i>

53:34.198 --> 53:36.199
<i>Negative.</i>

53:39.102 --> 53:42.004
<i>Clear target.
Permission to engage.</i>

53:42.037 --> 53:43.872
<i>Granted.</i>

53:48.443 --> 53:50.043
<i>Tango down.</i>

53:50.077 --> 53:53.513
That's bullshit, okay?
She's lying.

53:53.548 --> 53:55.514
Okay, she has to be lying.

53:55.549 --> 53:56.583
Mnh-mnh.

53:59.217 --> 54:01.886
Krieg, confirm he's dead.

54:01.920 --> 54:03.388
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

54:06.924 --> 54:09.125
I can't let them hurt you.

54:09.158 --> 54:10.627
We're gonna get
out of here, okay?

54:10.661 --> 54:12.295
I promise you.

54:12.328 --> 54:14.930
No, that's not a promise
that you can make.

54:16.164 --> 54:18.065
I'm so sorry.

54:18.099 --> 54:19.967
Okay, I'm sorry.
I have to go.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.369
I'm sorry, just stay here.

54:21.402 --> 54:23.303
Just stay here
until we're gone, okay?

54:23.336 --> 54:25.573
Erin, no!

54:25.606 --> 54:27.340
Erin, no, wait!

54:44.588 --> 54:47.523
Believe it or not,
we're the good guys!

55:23.451 --> 55:26.019
Hey! I'm what
you want, right?

55:26.052 --> 55:28.255
Come and get me!

55:28.288 --> 55:30.189
I'm giving myself up!

55:31.157 --> 55:33.192
Hey, pretty young thing.

55:33.225 --> 55:34.193
Hey.

55:34.226 --> 55:36.327
We need you alive...

55:36.361 --> 55:39.431
but not necessarily
in one piece!

55:40.765 --> 55:42.366
You are gonna spend
the rest of your life

55:42.399 --> 55:44.201
wishing you hadn't
fucked with us!

55:48.037 --> 55:50.305
Hey! Step away.

55:50.338 --> 55:52.474
Kid, you better
use that thing

55:52.508 --> 55:54.676
before I get up
and kick your ass.

55:57.077 --> 55:58.279
You guys okay?

55:58.312 --> 56:00.113
- You okay?
- Dad!

56:00.146 --> 56:01.347
Vic! Here!

56:01.381 --> 56:02.348
You all right?

56:02.382 --> 56:03.650
We heard you were dead!

56:03.683 --> 56:06.185
No, they just
gave me a workout.

56:06.218 --> 56:07.986
All right.
Let's get out of here.

56:08.020 --> 56:09.053
Yeah.

56:09.086 --> 56:10.121
Hold it.

56:13.356 --> 56:15.358
Stop! Hands up!

56:16.761 --> 56:18.360
Please don't shoot!
Please! Okay?

56:18.394 --> 56:20.095
- Neal?
- Erin?

56:21.430 --> 56:23.131
Where have you been?
We're under attack.

56:23.164 --> 56:24.999
Under attack?
What are you...? Bullshit!

56:25.033 --> 56:26.434
Did you not hear
the gunfire?

56:26.468 --> 56:28.235
What gunfire, where?
What do you mean?

56:28.268 --> 56:30.037
- Snipers on the roof...
- You could have died!

56:30.070 --> 56:31.405
Guys, focus!

56:31.438 --> 56:33.139
- You, what...
- Neal.

56:33.172 --> 56:35.542
Neal, is there a way
out of here, a hidden exit?

56:35.576 --> 56:38.343
Yeah, there's a, uh,
an old service tunnel

56:38.376 --> 56:40.613
between here
and the main building.

56:40.646 --> 56:42.179
- How do we get there?
- Actually, it's, uh...

56:42.213 --> 56:44.048
there's an old elevator
right, right this way.

56:44.081 --> 56:45.282
All right, let's go.

56:45.316 --> 56:47.183
Come on.
Right through here.

57:10.570 --> 57:12.303
Come on, go, go,
go, go, go.

57:29.284 --> 57:32.086
- Ooh!
- Hang on!

57:32.119 --> 57:33.722
Go! Come on, Neal!

57:33.755 --> 57:36.389
You guys get in that elevator
and get the hell out of here!

57:38.424 --> 57:39.592
Whoa!

57:41.694 --> 57:43.530
Go, go, go, go on!
Open the door!

57:48.299 --> 57:49.700
Come on, Neal,
open the door!

57:49.734 --> 57:51.201
Okay!

57:54.738 --> 57:56.138
Go! Go, go, go!

57:56.171 --> 57:57.473
Come on, come on, come on!

57:57.507 --> 57:59.542
Shawn.

57:59.575 --> 58:02.210
Get in the elevator,
come on!

58:02.243 --> 58:04.177
- Shawn!
- I can't leave my dad!

58:04.211 --> 58:06.280
- Come on, Shawn! Shawn!
- Just go with Neal!

58:07.414 --> 58:09.081
Goddamn it, Shawn,
I told you to go!

58:09.115 --> 58:10.517
No man left behind, right?

58:13.753 --> 58:16.054
I lost you once tonight.
It's not happening again.

58:48.747 --> 58:51.149
I'm sorry, Erin,
this isn't my fault.

58:51.182 --> 58:53.083
What are you talking about?

58:54.519 --> 58:55.887
No.

58:55.920 --> 58:58.889
No, you son of a bitch!
No, no, no, no!

58:58.922 --> 59:01.456
I'm really tired
of chasing you around.

59:02.858 --> 59:05.460
Ohh! Damnit!

59:05.494 --> 59:08.697
You said payment
upon delivery.

59:08.730 --> 59:10.864
So I'll take my cash
and I'll leave.

59:10.898 --> 59:14.702
You know, three people
can keep a secret...

59:15.768 --> 59:17.135
Aaah!

59:23.508 --> 59:25.810
...if two of them are dead.

59:25.843 --> 59:26.877
Aaahhh!

59:26.911 --> 59:29.647
- Please don't.
- Neal!

59:30.947 --> 59:34.583
No, Neal!

59:41.556 --> 59:43.290
Take care of the rest.

59:43.323 --> 59:45.257
What are you...
what are you...

59:45.291 --> 59:48.327
What are you doing?
What is she doing?

59:48.361 --> 59:49.562
Get off of me!

59:49.595 --> 59:52.397
Shawn! Shawn!
Look out, please!

59:52.430 --> 59:54.298
Run! Shawn!

01:00:03.873 --> 01:00:05.942
Shit! Come on!

01:00:10.746 --> 01:00:14.548
No! No, please, stop!
No! No!

01:00:23.689 --> 01:00:25.524
<i>Dad!</i>

01:00:25.557 --> 01:00:27.725
<i>Dad! Please!</i>

01:00:27.759 --> 01:00:30.662
<i>Ow! Ow.</i>

01:01:10.993 --> 01:01:13.227
Shawn. Shawn!

01:01:13.261 --> 01:01:14.763
Shawn!

01:01:14.797 --> 01:01:15.930
Shawn. Shawn!

01:01:17.732 --> 01:01:19.600
Shawn. Are you okay?

01:01:19.634 --> 01:01:22.469
- Are you okay?
- Dad.

01:01:22.502 --> 01:01:24.937
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:26.639
Let me get you up.
Come here.

01:01:29.041 --> 01:01:30.842
Thank God you're okay.

01:01:32.911 --> 01:01:34.611
- We gotta get out of here.
- Yeah.

01:01:34.645 --> 01:01:36.680
- You all right? Can you walk?
- Yeah.

01:01:36.714 --> 01:01:38.649
- All right.
- Let's go.

01:01:41.017 --> 01:01:42.485
All right, come on.

01:02:01.633 --> 01:02:03.768
Ya know, I'm thinkin'
about retirin'.

01:02:03.801 --> 01:02:07.337
Really.
So, what then?

01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:10.474
I don't know.
Finish the cabin. Fish.

01:02:10.507 --> 01:02:12.542
Not get shot at.

01:02:14.877 --> 01:02:18.580
Honestly, I was thinkin' we
could make up for lost time.

01:02:19.848 --> 01:02:22.750
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd like that.

01:02:26.653 --> 01:02:29.354
Shawn! There's a sniper!

01:02:29.387 --> 01:02:32.491
Aaaaah!
Help! Shawn!

01:02:32.524 --> 01:02:33.625
Come on! Shawn!
Ohh!

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:38.394
Shawn! Help!

01:02:38.429 --> 01:02:39.997
Come on! Come on!

01:02:43.967 --> 01:02:46.769
<i>It's time to go. Move it!</i>

01:02:49.571 --> 01:02:51.773
<i>What about the kid?</i>

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.809
<i>Kill him!</i>

01:02:55.976 --> 01:02:58.612
Sorry, mate.
Nothing personal.

01:03:02.882 --> 01:03:04.784
Uhh!

01:03:35.007 --> 01:03:37.308
Unhh! Aaah!

01:03:41.879 --> 01:03:43.047
Help!

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.514
Shawn!

01:04:14.839 --> 01:04:16.006
Shawn!

01:04:23.045 --> 01:04:25.013
- Aaah! Uhh!
- Aaaah!

01:04:25.047 --> 01:04:27.048
I don't believe!

01:04:27.081 --> 01:04:28.983
He is on roof!

01:04:43.595 --> 01:04:44.796
Aaaah!

01:04:45.763 --> 01:04:47.598
Now! Shoot him!

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:52.568
There! Shoot him!

01:04:56.137 --> 01:04:58.006
Huh? What is going on?

01:04:58.039 --> 01:04:59.908
Shoot!

01:04:59.941 --> 01:05:01.675
Watch where you're driving!
Idiot.

01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:16.554
Uhh! Ohh!

01:05:22.692 --> 01:05:24.660
Run him down!

01:05:24.693 --> 01:05:27.563
I <i>am</i> running down!

01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:54.751
No!

01:05:54.784 --> 01:05:55.752
Unhh!

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:57.020
Ohh!

01:06:04.892 --> 01:06:06.694
Yahhh!

01:06:06.727 --> 01:06:08.962
Unhh! Unhh!

01:06:11.898 --> 01:06:13.198
Aaah!

01:06:18.036 --> 01:06:19.938
Ohh! Please stop!

01:06:28.911 --> 01:06:31.013
- Arrghhh!
- Get him!

01:06:37.084 --> 01:06:39.954
Unhh! Unhh! Unhh!

01:06:43.790 --> 01:06:46.692
I ate a man in gulag!

01:06:46.725 --> 01:06:47.893
Uhh!

01:06:47.926 --> 01:06:49.861
Makes it seem like <i>kindness</i>

01:06:49.895 --> 01:06:52.029
compared to what
I do to you!

01:07:11.244 --> 01:07:12.679
Aaaah!

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:40.901
Dad!

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.982
Ahh. Aaaah!

01:08:02.985 --> 01:08:05.187
Shawn! Shawn!

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:40.996
<i>The Supreme
Court has indicated</i>

01:09:41.029 --> 01:09:42.932
<i>that a decision
has been made,</i>

01:09:42.965 --> 01:09:45.265
<i>and the justices are
finishing their opinions.</i>

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:48.002
<i>They will deliver their judgement
tomorrow at 8 a.m., Eastern time.</i>

01:09:50.337 --> 01:09:52.139
Who the hell is he?

01:09:53.805 --> 01:09:55.741
I lost...

01:09:55.775 --> 01:09:58.009
a lot of good people
tonight.

01:09:58.043 --> 01:10:01.646
Uh... Implicating me
with an unknown third party

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:04.349
was not part of the plan.

01:10:04.382 --> 01:10:07.118
His father is
a Delta team leader.

01:10:08.184 --> 01:10:09.752
Major Vic Davis?

01:10:09.786 --> 01:10:11.955
And where is he now?

01:10:12.921 --> 01:10:15.924
Maybe dead. Maybe not.

01:10:18.092 --> 01:10:20.362
Insurance policy.

01:10:20.395 --> 01:10:23.029
What about your mess
at the school?

01:10:23.063 --> 01:10:25.165
Cleaning crew.

01:10:25.198 --> 01:10:28.701
And you're sure that Walton...

01:10:28.734 --> 01:10:30.403
did what I asked?

01:10:30.437 --> 01:10:33.171
Doesn't matter.

01:10:33.204 --> 01:10:35.874
It matters to me.

01:11:08.799 --> 01:11:11.234
<i>...unconfirmed
source says that Justice Walton</i>

01:11:11.268 --> 01:11:14.770
<i>has submitted his judgement
against the Second Amendment.</i>

01:11:14.803 --> 01:11:17.474
There are times
when one must sacrifice a few

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:19.841
in order to save the many.

01:11:21.743 --> 01:11:24.278
We all have callings.

01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:34.252
I need you to drown the girl
and put her body in the boat.

01:11:35.754 --> 01:11:37.822
Get rid of the boy.

01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:41.125
Come on, baby doll.

01:11:43.494 --> 01:11:45.028
Let's have some fun!

01:11:45.061 --> 01:11:47.464
- No, hold on... Stop!
- Shawn!

01:11:47.498 --> 01:11:49.298
Sit.

01:12:30.298 --> 01:12:31.965
Put your hands up.

01:12:41.939 --> 01:12:44.309
- He's clean.
- All right, let's go.

01:12:46.577 --> 01:12:48.144
Hey, wait!

01:12:55.451 --> 01:12:58.920
Looks like your insurance
policy's about to pay off.

01:12:58.953 --> 01:13:01.021
I'll handle this.

01:13:28.143 --> 01:13:29.411
Aaaah!

01:13:33.913 --> 01:13:35.849
Uhhh! Aaaah!

01:13:36.617 --> 01:13:37.851
Uhhh!

01:13:52.162 --> 01:13:53.929
Aaaah!

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:58.967
Uhh! Aaah! Ohh!

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:02.305
Uhh!

01:14:03.405 --> 01:14:05.139
Ohhh!

01:14:06.541 --> 01:14:09.108
Aaaaah!

01:14:29.459 --> 01:14:33.027
It's too bad we didn't meet
under different circumstances.

01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:39.801
Could've been friends.

01:14:46.938 --> 01:14:48.006
Unhh!

01:14:55.945 --> 01:14:57.348
Aaaaah! Unhh!

01:15:56.026 --> 01:15:59.363
Might I
suggest you let me pass?

01:15:59.397 --> 01:16:01.298
We're fighting
for the same thing.

01:16:03.366 --> 01:16:04.634
Duty, Vic.

01:16:04.667 --> 01:16:07.403
To country.
To your family.

01:16:07.436 --> 01:16:09.371
It's what we fight for,

01:16:09.405 --> 01:16:11.972
and I have a duty
to follow my orders.

01:16:12.005 --> 01:16:13.474
It's simple.

01:16:26.518 --> 01:16:29.587
You and me are gonna go
on a little boat ride, love.

01:16:29.621 --> 01:16:32.723
Ohh! Ohh. Ahh.

01:16:52.539 --> 01:16:53.972
Unhh!

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.582
<i>En garde,</i> bitch.

01:17:06.450 --> 01:17:08.117
Stay back.

01:17:08.150 --> 01:17:11.287
You're not the first one
to wave a sword at me, love.

01:17:12.288 --> 01:17:13.689
I'm warning you.

01:17:13.722 --> 01:17:15.989
I know how
to use this thing.

01:17:17.191 --> 01:17:18.225
Yahh!

01:17:18.259 --> 01:17:19.426
Brat!

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:20.627
Yahh!

01:17:23.062 --> 01:17:24.229
Ahh!

01:17:24.263 --> 01:17:26.131
Oh!

01:17:59.758 --> 01:18:02.192
This. Is. Not. Fair!

01:18:03.495 --> 01:18:07.331
Aaaah! Aaah!

01:18:15.638 --> 01:18:16.738
Aaah!

01:18:36.354 --> 01:18:38.389
Hyahh! Hyahh!

01:18:56.236 --> 01:18:57.771
Aaah! Ohh.

01:19:01.574 --> 01:19:03.743
You know,
I was supposed to drown you.

01:19:03.776 --> 01:19:06.578
That's what I have to do.

01:19:13.384 --> 01:19:14.617
Hey. Hey.

01:19:14.651 --> 01:19:16.619
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

01:19:25.493 --> 01:19:28.528
I'm sorry.
I just...

01:19:28.562 --> 01:19:30.730
I'm really happy
we're alive.

01:19:30.764 --> 01:19:32.332
Yeah, me too.

01:19:33.832 --> 01:19:35.701
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

01:19:35.734 --> 01:19:37.303
I'm okay now.

01:19:38.836 --> 01:19:40.438
Erin!

01:19:40.471 --> 01:19:41.606
Dad.

01:19:41.639 --> 01:19:43.240
Erin.

01:19:44.541 --> 01:19:46.443
Oh, Dad. Oh.

01:19:49.378 --> 01:19:50.479
Unhh!

01:19:53.448 --> 01:19:55.216
Aaaah!

01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:57.284
Ahhhh! Aah!

01:20:06.726 --> 01:20:08.560
Aaaah!

01:20:12.263 --> 01:20:15.098
I gotta...
I gotta go help my dad.

01:20:26.173 --> 01:20:27.875
That's far enough, Judge.

01:20:32.613 --> 01:20:34.648
Let it go, Phillips.
It's over.

01:20:34.681 --> 01:20:37.683
You're not the one
calling the shots here.

01:20:39.285 --> 01:20:41.386
Director Phillips!

01:20:41.419 --> 01:20:44.322
You have three seconds
to put the gun down.

01:20:44.356 --> 01:20:46.256
What's your play?

01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:49.393
Huh? You gonna execute
the Director of the CIA

01:20:49.426 --> 01:20:52.362
of the United States of America?

01:20:52.395 --> 01:20:54.464
Yes.

01:20:54.497 --> 01:20:56.598
Two...

01:20:56.632 --> 01:20:57.733
one.

01:21:01.369 --> 01:21:03.871
You think this ends here?

01:21:05.839 --> 01:21:08.775
I'm just the tip of the spear.

01:21:29.224 --> 01:21:31.426
- I'm so glad you're okay.
- Me too.

01:21:31.459 --> 01:21:32.927
Ow! My arm!

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:00.816
Genevieve?

01:22:02.316 --> 01:22:03.851
Are you here?

01:22:45.951 --> 01:22:48.287
You survived.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:50.254
That's good.

01:22:54.058 --> 01:22:56.693
Drink?

01:22:56.727 --> 01:22:59.862
History won't be
kind to you, Mike.

01:23:00.996 --> 01:23:04.332
And that's... unfortunate.

01:23:05.734 --> 01:23:07.669
Our benefactor is worried

01:23:07.702 --> 01:23:10.604
that Walton will talk?

01:23:10.637 --> 01:23:14.307
Because I can assure you,
he won't.

01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:17.543
And he won't change
his judgement, either.

01:23:19.444 --> 01:23:22.247
He knows I'm watching.

01:23:23.814 --> 01:23:26.350
And he's afraid.

01:23:29.986 --> 01:23:32.589
All of this will be...

01:23:32.622 --> 01:23:34.490
our secret.

01:23:35.557 --> 01:23:38.459
Mike....

01:23:38.493 --> 01:23:41.362
three people
can keep a secret...

01:23:49.001 --> 01:23:52.403
...if two of them are dead.

01:24:30.734 --> 01:24:33.069
Hey.

01:24:33.103 --> 01:24:34.738
What time is it?

01:24:35.738 --> 01:24:37.940
Past six.

01:24:37.973 --> 01:24:40.508
What's up?
Are you okay?

01:24:45.112 --> 01:24:47.915
Did I ever tell you
how I got this watch?

01:24:49.616 --> 01:24:51.417
I always figured you just

01:24:51.450 --> 01:24:53.553
took it off some dead
terrorist or something.

01:24:56.421 --> 01:24:58.657
I-I'm just kidding.
How'd you get it?

01:25:00.858 --> 01:25:03.861
President Clinton
awarded my entire unit

01:25:03.894 --> 01:25:06.796
the Medal of Honor in '97.

01:25:07.997 --> 01:25:10.966
- What?
- Yep.

01:25:10.999 --> 01:25:12.601
Holy shit.

01:25:12.634 --> 01:25:14.669
You got the Medal of Honor?

01:25:14.702 --> 01:25:17.371
How did I not know
about this?

01:25:17.405 --> 01:25:19.105
It's classified.

01:25:22.143 --> 01:25:24.810
So the president
goes down the line,

01:25:24.844 --> 01:25:27.112
by the time he gets to me,

01:25:27.147 --> 01:25:29.480
they're a medal short.

01:25:29.514 --> 01:25:31.716
But the president,
without missing a beat,

01:25:31.749 --> 01:25:34.084
he takes off his Rolex...

01:25:34.117 --> 01:25:36.653
this Rolex...

01:25:36.687 --> 01:25:38.821
and he hands it to me.

01:25:38.855 --> 01:25:43.024
He says, "I can't have a man
showin' up for the Medal of Honor

01:25:43.058 --> 01:25:45.861
"and leavin' my office
empty-handed.

01:25:45.894 --> 01:25:48.129
"I want you to wear this watch

01:25:48.163 --> 01:25:50.564
and remember
the lives you saved."

01:25:56.603 --> 01:25:59.471
Son...
once you take a life,

01:25:59.504 --> 01:26:02.640
you never sleep
quite the same way again.

01:26:04.876 --> 01:26:07.644
You're not really
the same guy anymore.

01:26:12.047 --> 01:26:15.151
So I'm gonna tell you
what President Clinton told me.

01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:21.488
When you wear this,

01:26:21.521 --> 01:26:24.892
I want you to think
about the lives you saved...

01:26:24.925 --> 01:26:26.959
not the ones you took.

01:26:33.098 --> 01:26:36.700
All that time you were gone...

01:26:39.069 --> 01:26:41.704
I want you to know there
wasn't a day that went by

01:26:41.738 --> 01:26:43.640
where I wasn't proud
to be your son.

01:26:48.076 --> 01:26:50.145
I always meant
to tell you that.

01:26:53.047 --> 01:26:55.116
I'm proud of you, too.

01:26:56.549 --> 01:26:58.185
- Thanks, Dad.
- Okay.

01:27:01.553 --> 01:27:04.088
All right, that's enough
of the mushy stuff.

01:27:05.924 --> 01:27:07.492
Who wants a drink?

01:27:07.525 --> 01:27:09.493
Um, I think so.

01:27:09.526 --> 01:27:10.827
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:27:10.861 --> 01:27:12.562
I'm gonna leave
you two kids alone.

01:27:14.530 --> 01:27:16.065
Hi. So...
Oh, uh, Dad.

01:27:16.098 --> 01:27:17.800
Yeah?

01:27:17.833 --> 01:27:19.534
Merry Christmas.

01:27:23.271 --> 01:27:24.972
Thanks, son.

01:27:25.005 --> 01:27:26.974
Merry Christmas,
young lady.

01:27:27.007 --> 01:27:28.641
Merry Christmas.

01:27:29.909 --> 01:27:31.678
Who's the lucky guy?

01:27:31.711 --> 01:27:34.579
Stop! I see the meds
are kickin' in.

01:27:34.613 --> 01:27:37.782
- Oh, my goodness, it's a twist-off.
- I know, what can I say?

01:27:42.187 --> 01:27:44.688
Mr. Vic Davis.

01:27:49.091 --> 01:27:51.827
You ready to pay your dues?

01:27:53.162 --> 01:27:56.231
Oh, Vic!

01:28:10.637 --> 01:28:15.637
