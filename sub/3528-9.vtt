WEBVTT

01:41.101 --> 01:44.145
The child had the appearance
of a male...

01:45.022 --> 01:47.732
...about four months old.

01:48.734 --> 01:51.486
However, the foetus...

01:51.779 --> 01:55.198
...there were signs of deformity.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.908
Of abnormality.

01:59.203 --> 02:01.329
Perhaps, after all...

02:01.789 --> 02:05.875
...the queen's miscarriage
was a blessing in disguise.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.811
Majesty.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.371
Madame.

02:43.539 --> 02:44.622
Monsieur Ambassador.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.292
I beg you.

02:48.460 --> 02:51.546
King Francis must be persuaded
to accept the marriage of his son...

02:51.713 --> 02:55.383
...to our daughter Elizabeth
so that l may not be ruined or lost.

02:55.551 --> 02:58.886
For l see myself very near that,
and in more trouble and grief...

02:59.054 --> 03:00.972
...than l was ever in
before my marriage.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.267
I cannot speak to you
more fully now...

03:04.810 --> 03:07.603
...nor dare I express my fears
in writing, but please...

03:08.272 --> 03:10.481
...after everything l've done
for France...

03:11.149 --> 03:14.902
...as you love me,
do the best you can for me...

03:15.279 --> 03:16.320
...for God's sake.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.079
Mr. Edward Seymour.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.794
-Master Seymour.
-Mr. Secretary.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.255
We don't know each other well,
but we shall.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.465
I've every confidence.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.634
It is His Majesty's pleasure...

03:38.802 --> 03:41.596
...to appoint you a gentleman
of the privy chamber.

03:41.763 --> 03:44.265
In that capacity,
you will attend His Majesty daily...

03:44.433 --> 03:45.975
...and as he sees fit to use you.

03:46.143 --> 03:50.271
It is, you will understand,
a special and privileged position.

03:50.439 --> 03:52.148
I do understand.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.942
And l am deeply honoured,
Mr. Secretary.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.699
There is one more thing.

04:02.534 --> 04:05.620
His Majesty has indicated to me
he would like to pay court...

04:05.787 --> 04:08.956
...to your sister from time to time,
although to avoid any scandal...

04:09.124 --> 04:11.208
...attaching itself
to your sister's name...

04:11.376 --> 04:14.587
...only in the presence of a member
or members of your family.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.965
In which case, I am more than happy
to offer you and your family...

04:18.133 --> 04:20.593
...my private chambers
in the palace.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.137
They are adjacent
to the king's private chamber...

04:23.305 --> 04:26.474
...with a connecting gallery
for greater privacy.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.851
You're most generous,
Mr. Secretary.

04:29.019 --> 04:32.521
I'm sure my father would like
to repay your kindness.

04:36.443 --> 04:39.111
You've given the Seymours
your rooms?

04:39.696 --> 04:40.988
Yes, Your Majesty.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.075
Idiot.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.744
We have given royal assent...

04:46.912 --> 04:50.581
...to the act stripping the bishopric
of Norwich of the town of Lynn.

04:51.375 --> 04:55.378
The new beneficiary is
Sir Thomas Boleyn, Earl of Wiltshire.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.506
I also intend giving him two
of the dissolved abbeys.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.760
You must inform him
of his good fortune.

05:03.679 --> 05:04.845
Yes, Your Majesty.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.186
No one must know our plans,
Mr. Cromwell.

05:18.735 --> 05:22.571
Come here, Jane.
Let me look at you.

05:27.536 --> 05:29.578
How beautiful you are.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.790
Ready?

05:33.250 --> 05:34.291
Yes.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.043
Shall we?

05:51.226 --> 05:52.560
Jane.

05:52.728 --> 05:53.769
Majesty.

05:56.148 --> 05:58.315
I have something for you.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.161
Now open it.

06:16.877 --> 06:17.960
Thank you.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.424
I will treasure this all my life.

06:25.427 --> 06:30.222
And if they ever open my grave,
they will find it again...

06:30.390 --> 06:32.099
...right next to my heart.

06:50.285 --> 06:51.952
Majesty.

07:02.839 --> 07:06.717
I wonder why, after all this time,
he still will not marry Madge?

07:06.885 --> 07:09.011
I think Norris comes
into your chambers more...

07:09.179 --> 07:11.138
...for Your Majesty
than he does for Madge.

07:12.974 --> 07:15.810
-For me?
-Yes.

07:20.649 --> 07:23.776
-Cromwell's rooms?
-Yes.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.336
What is that?

07:44.256 --> 07:46.173
It's a locket, Your Majesty.

07:48.718 --> 07:57.685
Let me see it.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.236
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.249
Mr. Secretary.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.087
Majesty.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.593
I have good news, Your Majesty.

09:13.261 --> 09:16.972
The bill for the dissolution of the
large monasteries has just passed.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.433
Our reformation is moving apace.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.145
I have been told privately,
Mr. Secretary...

09:23.313 --> 09:26.440
...that the king has already sold
Sawley Abbey in Yorkshire...

09:26.608 --> 09:28.108
...to one of his courtiers...

09:28.276 --> 09:30.986
...though the bill has not yet
reached the statute book...

09:31.154 --> 09:34.114
...and plainly on your advice.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.785
Our reformation was never meant
to be about personal gain.

09:37.953 --> 09:43.040
Religious houses should not be
sold off, but converted to better uses.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.793
Madam...

09:45.961 --> 09:48.045
...the confiscated assets
will be used...

09:48.213 --> 09:52.049
...to the pleasure of Almighty God
and to the profit of this realm...

09:52.217 --> 09:53.717
...which is but a pygmy...

09:53.885 --> 09:56.637
...but shall one day
be greater even than Spain.

09:58.807 --> 10:02.309
So is it true you've given your
private rooms here to the Seymours?

10:07.649 --> 10:10.985
I am the Queen of England.
You will answer me. ls it true?

10:12.112 --> 10:13.737
Yes. lt is true.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.326
You have overreached yourself,
Mr. Cromwell.

10:19.995 --> 10:24.665
Believe me, you have placed yourself
in very great danger.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.419
Do you believe me?

10:28.670 --> 10:32.840
Or do you assume l no longer possess
the power to crush you?

10:35.176 --> 10:38.846
It would be an easy mistake to make,
Mr. Cromwell.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.697
I thought you might like this
returned to you.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.451
Oh, thank you.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.251
Good evening, Your Excellency.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.713
Please, may l take your coat
and your hat?

11:12.881 --> 11:14.298
Thank you.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.091
Please come this way.

11:21.389 --> 11:24.058
His Excellency,
the imperial ambassador.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.893
Eustace.

11:26.061 --> 11:28.604
It's so good of you to come
all the way to Shoreditch.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.230
Believe me, Mr. Secretary...

11:30.398 --> 11:34.568
...l would travel a great deal further
for the pleasure of talking to you.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.328
May I be blunt?

11:45.205 --> 11:49.917
Is it true that you have fallen out
with Queen Anne?

11:50.335 --> 11:51.919
Yes.

11:53.129 --> 11:57.257
I believe she hates me
and wants to have me executed.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.510
Are you not afraid?

12:00.470 --> 12:01.762
No.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.099
No, I trust my master so much...

12:05.266 --> 12:08.268
...l fancy she cannot
do me any harm.

12:08.645 --> 12:13.107
Nevertheless, I cannot but wish you
a more gracious mistress.

12:13.441 --> 12:19.113
One more grateful for the inestimable
service you have done the king.

12:20.156 --> 12:23.659
For the sake of argument,
suppose the king...

12:25.328 --> 12:28.956
...were considering
taking another wife?

12:29.958 --> 12:33.127
It would certainly be
to his advantage.

12:33.420 --> 12:38.298
For here is a king who has so far
been disappointed of male issue...

12:38.466 --> 12:40.634
...and who knows
that his present marriage...

12:40.802 --> 12:43.595
...will never be held as lawful.

12:47.183 --> 12:50.310
The king requests your presence
at court.

12:50.895 --> 12:54.565
I am sure he wishes to confirm
a new alliance with the emperor.

12:54.858 --> 12:57.484
What else he means to tell you,
I cannot guess.

12:58.570 --> 13:02.030
Then l look forward eagerly
to finding out, Mr. Secretary.

13:11.082 --> 13:15.002
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.715
Madam.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.760
Lady Rochford.

13:23.928 --> 13:27.306
Lady Rochford,
what can l do for you?

13:27.474 --> 13:30.434
You could ask your brother
to be kind to me.

13:30.602 --> 13:33.437
He is cruel in every way.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.356
Come now, l don't believe you.

13:37.317 --> 13:41.069
There are others
that he has preferred to me.

13:44.115 --> 13:45.616
Hush.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.868
You don't understand.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.662
He does not treat me
as his proper wife...

13:50.830 --> 13:53.123
...as the king treats you.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.585
Let me tell you something,
Lady Rochford.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.379
The king cannot satisfy a woman.

13:59.547 --> 14:03.217
He has neither the skill,
nor the virility.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.222
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

14:09.432 --> 14:13.685
Make way for His Excellency.
Make way.

14:17.232 --> 14:20.442
We must give up the idea
of a French alliance.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.611
The king seems implacably
against it...

14:22.779 --> 14:24.446
...just as he seems more inclined...

14:24.614 --> 14:26.740
...to embrace a new alliance
with the emperor.

14:26.908 --> 14:29.743
-Are you listening to me?
-Yes, Father.

14:29.911 --> 14:33.747
It seems that most of the country is
still in favour of an imperial alliance...

14:33.915 --> 14:36.917
...so it would serve us nothing
to swim against the tide.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.669
No.

14:40.797 --> 14:44.132
The imperial ambassador
is to be received at court.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.676
Make a great fuss of him.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.637
In the first place by inviting him
to kiss your cheek.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.598
Then you and the king
will dine with him.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.559
Say harsh things
against the French...

14:53.726 --> 14:55.435
...in the presence
of the ambassadors.

14:55.603 --> 14:58.855
Say they betrayed your trust,
they are hypocritical and false friends.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.857
Whatever else you can think of.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.651
Yes, Father.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.155
Anne.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.324
We have come so far.

15:10.285 --> 15:14.621
No one is going to be allowed
to destroy us.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.957
No one.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.545
Do you understand?

15:24.424 --> 15:27.301
I understand.

15:47.488 --> 15:51.158
His Excellency,
the imperial ambassador.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.496
Jesus Christ, you scared me.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.915
Their Gracious Majesties.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.215
Your Majesty.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.759
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

16:08.926 --> 16:11.762
Your Majesty.

16:11.929 --> 16:18.101
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

16:18.269 --> 16:19.603
Your Majesty.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.229
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.814
Your Majesty.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.531
After Mass, Mr. Chapuys is sure
to dine with us?

16:34.077 --> 16:35.994
Excuse me.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.955
But he's gone.

16:39.874 --> 16:42.209
It is not without good reason.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.714
Something is happening, Mark. l--

16:47.882 --> 16:50.133
I just don't know what it is.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.597
Eminency...

17:38.099 --> 17:39.641
...l know that in the past...

17:39.809 --> 17:43.145
...there have been misunderstandings
between my family and you.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.981
Some intemperate words.

17:46.149 --> 17:50.527
Certain things that should not have
been said and are now regretted.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.529
But we both live in a real world.

17:52.697 --> 17:55.615
We must take our friends
as we find them.

17:56.075 --> 18:00.787
I know the emperor is keen to protect
his lucrative trade links with England.

18:00.955 --> 18:05.250
And obviously my family is
in a position to help and assist him...

18:05.418 --> 18:07.586
...which is what
we are determined to do.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.380
So l think we should drink a toast
to new beginnings...

18:10.548 --> 18:15.010
...and to new friendships
and to a mutually beneficial future.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.906
And where are you from,
Excellency?

18:36.073 --> 18:39.659
I am proud to be the ambassador
from Milan, madame.

18:39.827 --> 18:43.580
Milan. Were you not occupied
by the French?

18:44.373 --> 18:48.919
Alas, we are still occupied
by French troops.

18:49.086 --> 18:52.631
Then you will agree with me that
the French are deceitful in everything?

18:52.799 --> 18:55.008
In fact, can anyone here tell me...

18:55.176 --> 18:58.595
...that the French are anything
but liars and hypocrites?

18:59.347 --> 19:00.931
Do they ever tell the truth?

19:01.432 --> 19:03.225
How many treaties do they honour?

19:03.392 --> 19:05.435
How many promises do they keep?

19:17.281 --> 19:19.032
Mr. Cromwell. What's happening?

19:19.200 --> 19:21.868
His Majesty will be having
an audience with the ambassador.

19:22.036 --> 19:24.037
That's what we're waiting for.

19:28.543 --> 19:30.418
Your Excellency.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.712
Follow me.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.924
Excuse me.

19:43.558 --> 19:45.892
-Excellency.
-Thank you, Majesty.

19:49.981 --> 19:52.232
I hear your master is anxious
for an alliance?

19:52.400 --> 19:53.650
He is, Your Majesty.

19:53.818 --> 19:54.901
On what terms?

19:55.069 --> 19:59.281
On such terms as Mr. Cromwell
has outlined to us.

19:59.657 --> 20:03.451
The restoration of some relation
between England and Rome...

20:03.619 --> 20:06.746
...the inclusion of the Lady Mary
in the line of succession...

20:06.914 --> 20:11.001
...and support for the emperor
in his war with France over Milan.

20:12.253 --> 20:15.714
As far as the Lady Mary is concerned,
it may be that God has not thought...

20:15.882 --> 20:18.174
...to send Your Majesty
a male issue...

20:18.342 --> 20:23.597
...because he believes that England
should have a female succession.

20:26.684 --> 20:30.103
What are you alleging, Excellency?

20:30.938 --> 20:34.774
Am l not a man as other men?

20:35.693 --> 20:39.779
Am l not?

20:41.782 --> 20:45.702
You do not know all my secrets!

20:56.505 --> 20:57.881
I want everything in writing.

20:58.049 --> 21:00.800
The emperor's offer.
Everything in writing.

21:01.135 --> 21:03.887
That is not possible, Your Majesty.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.682
Do you think I am a child...

21:07.850 --> 21:11.394
...to be first whipped
and then petted?

21:12.313 --> 21:15.231
If your master wants to deal with me,
he must first apologise...

21:15.399 --> 21:17.776
...for all his ill treatment of me
in the past.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.819
He must accept Queen Anne.

21:22.823 --> 21:26.826
I have nothing more
to say to your master.

21:39.340 --> 21:42.592
Princes are different from us
and are not to be easily understood.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.386
Gentlemen.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.533
-Your Grace.
-Majesty.

22:07.076 --> 22:11.997
As your oldest friend
as well as your most loyal subject...

22:12.164 --> 22:15.208
...l feel it's my duty,
however painful...

22:15.710 --> 22:18.003
...to report some truths to you.

22:18.629 --> 22:21.589
"Truth?" said jesting Pilate.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.967
"What is truth?"

22:26.887 --> 22:29.347
There are some rumours
about the queen's behaviour.

22:30.433 --> 22:33.643
It seems she entertains men
in her room at night.

22:35.896 --> 22:37.647
Flirts...

22:39.567 --> 22:42.235
...and behaves intimately with them.

22:50.536 --> 22:53.580
My lords, this kingdom is imperilled
and in danger.

22:53.748 --> 22:57.083
But not by some foreign power
or strangers with evil intent against us.

22:58.252 --> 23:01.921
It's come to my notice that some acts
of treason and other offences...

23:02.089 --> 23:04.758
...have been committed
by those we loved and trusted.

23:04.925 --> 23:07.427
By members of our own court.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.180
Mr. Rich...

23:10.347 --> 23:14.100
...as solicitor general, I am appointing
you and Mr. Cromwell...

23:14.268 --> 23:17.103
...to head a commission
of oyer and terminer...

23:17.271 --> 23:19.939
...to investigate whether
or not these offences be true.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.114
Good day, gentlemen.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.996
Lady Sheldon...

23:35.164 --> 23:39.167
...l warn you not to repeat to anyone
what passes between us here today.

23:43.047 --> 23:46.883
You live in close proximity
with Her Majesty, the queen.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.887
Have you ever seen her entertain men
in her chambers...

23:51.055 --> 23:53.723
...in what you would consider to be...

23:54.183 --> 23:55.809
...an inappropriate way?

23:58.813 --> 24:00.647
No, sir.

24:03.984 --> 24:05.819
Are you certain of that?

24:06.821 --> 24:08.571
Yes, sir.

24:10.241 --> 24:13.243
I must warn you, my lady,
that those concealing the truth...

24:13.410 --> 24:15.995
...from those commissioned
by the king to discover it...

24:16.163 --> 24:19.249
...are themselves guilty of treason...

24:19.416 --> 24:22.168
...and are very likely to be hanged.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.636
Your Majesty.

24:34.098 --> 24:38.393
Jane, for very good reasons, l want
you to leave Whitehall for a while.

24:38.561 --> 24:41.479
-Go back home with your father.
-l will leave.

24:41.647 --> 24:44.023
I'll do anything Your Majesty
commands me to do.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.859
I want to tell you...

24:46.026 --> 24:50.029
...in this slippery world, you represent
for me all that is innocent...

24:50.197 --> 24:52.448
...everything that is good...

24:52.616 --> 24:54.117
...unsullied...

24:54.285 --> 24:56.244
...uncorrupted.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.416
It will not be for long.

25:01.876 --> 25:03.877
And after that....

25:06.505 --> 25:09.883
After that,
we can have our hearts' desires.

25:13.053 --> 25:14.470
Go.

25:18.225 --> 25:20.727
Are you certain?

25:21.228 --> 25:22.395
Come on!

25:22.563 --> 25:24.063
It--

25:24.982 --> 25:28.776
It's true that some men came
into the queen's chambers...

25:29.069 --> 25:30.945
...at undue hours.

25:31.113 --> 25:33.406
And sometimes she flirted
with them, but--

25:34.200 --> 25:35.783
What are their names?

25:39.788 --> 25:42.248
Lord Rochford, of course.

25:42.416 --> 25:44.000
And?

25:44.919 --> 25:46.461
And Sir Henry Norris.

25:46.754 --> 25:48.338
And?

25:51.467 --> 25:53.343
The king's groom, Brereton.

25:53.802 --> 25:54.844
And?

25:56.847 --> 25:59.265
And Mark Smeaton, the musician.

25:59.600 --> 26:04.646
And?

26:06.440 --> 26:09.692
Well, l saw her hugging
and kissing her brother.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.033
Her brother?

26:19.203 --> 26:21.871
But thought nothing of it.

26:34.927 --> 26:37.303
Do you believe this to be true?

26:39.056 --> 26:42.225
I believe that is true, yes.

26:46.647 --> 26:49.232
You believe that your husband...

26:49.400 --> 26:52.652
...committed incest with the queen?

27:02.663 --> 27:07.875
Hello?

27:13.382 --> 27:15.049
Mr. Cromwell...

27:16.719 --> 27:19.262
...to what do l owe
this great pleasure?

27:19.722 --> 27:22.098
-Hello.
-Mr. Smeaton.

27:28.647 --> 27:29.856
Have l done something?

27:32.359 --> 27:33.901
Calm, Mr. Smeaton.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.365
Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?

27:39.533 --> 27:43.411
I want to know when you slept
with the queen and how many times.

27:43.579 --> 27:48.207
I never slept with the queen.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.877
Mister-- I don't understand,
Mr. Cromwell.

27:53.881 --> 27:56.424
You're going to have to tell the truth.

27:56.633 --> 27:59.635
I want the truth or, God help me,
it will go badly with you.

27:59.803 --> 28:04.640
I swear to Almighty God
I never slept with Her Majesty.

28:05.184 --> 28:06.809
I never even dreamt of it.

28:06.977 --> 28:09.937
You're only a musician,
yet you spent a great deal of money...

28:10.105 --> 28:13.816
...on horses, liveries for your servants.
Where did you get the money?

28:13.984 --> 28:15.610
Was it for services rendered?

28:16.070 --> 28:17.737
I swear to God Almighty...

28:18.238 --> 28:20.114
...l never slept with Her Majesty.

28:21.116 --> 28:22.575
I never even dreamt of it.

28:27.623 --> 28:29.248
God.

28:34.922 --> 28:36.964
Off we go and--

28:37.883 --> 28:39.759
Nan. Quicker, Nan.

28:41.595 --> 28:43.805
One, two, three, four.

28:44.306 --> 28:49.018
Jump left.
And we add the turn on the third.

28:49.353 --> 28:50.478
Lady Sheldon.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.522
I believe you know
what you're doing.

28:55.067 --> 28:58.069
Okay, left arm from south.

28:59.238 --> 29:00.947
Forward and back
and at this break--

29:03.784 --> 29:05.618
Continue.

29:10.958 --> 29:13.960
Your visit to France with the king
is postponed for a week.

29:14.128 --> 29:15.461
Why?

29:15.629 --> 29:17.797
And there's something else.

29:18.215 --> 29:20.758
Mark Smeaton is arrested.

29:21.844 --> 29:24.971
-What for?
-We don't know yet.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.473
I've got to go.

29:44.658 --> 29:47.034
No. No.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.744
No.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.372
No. No!

30:08.599 --> 30:10.683
Sir Henry, you are here again.

30:11.685 --> 30:14.437
Yet you never seem
to have the courage to marry the lady.

30:15.314 --> 30:18.941
Madam, marriage is not something
one should hurry into.

30:19.109 --> 30:20.234
No.

30:20.402 --> 30:24.030
I know the truth.
You look for dead men's shoes.

30:24.448 --> 30:26.157
Madam, I really must protest.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.035
You suppose that if anything bad
happened to the king...

30:29.203 --> 30:31.454
...then you would think to have me.

30:31.622 --> 30:33.789
Madam, if l ever such a thought...

30:33.957 --> 30:35.708
...then l wish my head were cut off.

30:35.876 --> 30:37.460
Oh, that could be arranged.

30:52.059 --> 30:53.643
Nan.

30:54.019 --> 30:55.436
Madam.

30:56.688 --> 30:59.982
Get them to fetch Elizabeth to me
tomorrow. l want to see my daughter.

31:00.150 --> 31:01.400
Yes, madam.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.152
And, Nan...

31:04.696 --> 31:07.240
...if anything should happen to me...

31:07.616 --> 31:10.201
...will you promise to care for her?

31:10.661 --> 31:12.578
Yes, madam.

31:30.097 --> 31:34.934
Sooner or later, Mr. Smeaton,
you will tell us the truth.

31:35.185 --> 31:37.645
-So?
-lt's not-- lt's not true.

31:37.813 --> 31:41.232
-What?
-lt's not true.

31:41.400 --> 31:45.611
It's not true.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.204
Please--

32:15.183 --> 32:18.978
The king has called
an emergency meeting of the council.

32:19.146 --> 32:22.982
-Why wasn't I told?
-Because I wasn't told either.

32:24.026 --> 32:28.654
For God's sake, make sure you
keep the king always in your sight.

32:28.822 --> 32:32.325
Your Majesty,
Mr. Cromwell approaches.

32:37.331 --> 32:38.497
Smeaton has confessed.

32:42.669 --> 32:44.462
Load up.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.256
-Sir Henry.
-Sir.

32:47.424 --> 32:49.008
Come with me.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.067
Did you know the queen
was pregnant again?

33:06.234 --> 33:07.526
No, Your Majesty.

33:07.694 --> 33:09.028
How should I?

33:09.196 --> 33:11.572
Because you
may be the child's father...

33:12.199 --> 33:14.867
...since you loved her so well,
as many have testified.

33:15.035 --> 33:17.870
Majesty is being ridiculous.

33:21.375 --> 33:23.292
So then l'm a figure
of ridicule to you?

33:23.710 --> 33:24.877
-Madness.
-Guards.

33:25.462 --> 33:27.129
Arrest him.

33:28.215 --> 33:29.256
Take him to the Tower.

33:29.424 --> 33:31.467
-Majesty. Majesty.
-Hold back.

33:31.635 --> 33:33.386
Majesty!

33:46.233 --> 33:48.275
Master Brereton,
by order of the king...

33:48.443 --> 33:51.320
-...you are arrested for high treason.
-Amen.

34:14.761 --> 34:17.930
-Where are you going, my lord?
-l have to see the king.

34:18.098 --> 34:19.515
It's too late, George.

34:19.683 --> 34:21.434
Much too late.

34:25.021 --> 34:28.274
My lord, Sir Thomas, you are both
arrested for high treason...

34:28.442 --> 34:32.194
...and having carnal knowledge
of Her Majesty, the queen.

34:32.571 --> 34:33.946
What?

34:47.961 --> 34:49.295
Henry...

34:49.463 --> 34:50.796
...please.

34:51.131 --> 34:52.256
Henry...

34:52.424 --> 34:54.133
...please.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.552
For the love you bear our child.

34:56.720 --> 34:59.388
-For Elizabeth, have mercy.
-You've always lied to me.

34:59.556 --> 35:00.598
No.

35:00.766 --> 35:04.143
You weren't a virgin when you married
me. You were not what you seemed.

35:04.311 --> 35:06.312
Your father and brother
arranged everything.

35:06.480 --> 35:09.190
No. I loved you.

35:09.357 --> 35:12.985
I loved you and l love you still.

35:13.361 --> 35:15.488
After everything we've been
to each other.

35:15.655 --> 35:16.989
After everything we were.

35:17.365 --> 35:18.991
Please.

35:24.039 --> 35:25.539
One more chance.

35:27.167 --> 35:28.834
One more.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.378
Henry.

35:35.634 --> 35:36.675
Your Majesty.

35:38.261 --> 35:41.514
Your Majesty, I beseech you!

35:50.649 --> 35:53.734
You know why you've been arrested.

35:54.110 --> 35:58.155
It's not enough that you commit vile
incest with your sister, the queen...

35:58.323 --> 36:02.159
...and her tongue in your mouth
and your tongue in hers...

36:03.537 --> 36:06.997
...against the commands
of God Almighty.

36:08.667 --> 36:14.213
But you must plot
regicide against the king...

36:14.464 --> 36:17.550
...so that Anne could marry one
of her lovers and rule as regent...

36:17.717 --> 36:20.970
-...over her bastard child.
-No.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.476
No, sir.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.813
You baffle me.

36:32.399 --> 36:36.735
My enemies have poisoned the air
with their horrid lies.

36:37.362 --> 36:42.116
Whatever my sister has done,
it is not with me or mine.

36:46.246 --> 36:49.164
I am innocent, Mr. Cromwell.

36:49.749 --> 36:51.584
I swear to you.

36:51.751 --> 36:54.712
I swear on the blood of Christ.

36:55.547 --> 36:58.257
I am innocent.

37:01.011 --> 37:02.303
Of course you are.

37:04.431 --> 37:07.683
Tell me, Mr. Brereton...

37:08.894 --> 37:12.730
...do you ever have carnal knowledge
of the Queen's Majesty?

37:22.949 --> 37:24.033
Yes.

37:34.127 --> 37:35.711
Yes, l did.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.674
I condemn them utterly. Utterly.

37:40.842 --> 37:43.636
All those men,
whatever their rank or station, who--

37:43.803 --> 37:46.013
Where l--
Whatever their rank or station...

37:46.181 --> 37:48.015
...who deceived the king...

37:48.183 --> 37:50.726
...and slipped between the sheets
with his lawful wife.

37:50.894 --> 37:52.353
I con--

37:52.812 --> 37:54.355
Utterly.

37:57.192 --> 37:58.776
For such...

37:59.277 --> 38:01.320
...awful adultery...

38:01.821 --> 38:04.406
...there should be
only one punishment.

38:36.189 --> 38:38.607
My lords, why have you come?

38:39.526 --> 38:42.236
This is the warrant for your arrest.

38:42.404 --> 38:44.697
You are charged with adultery
with Mark Smeaton...

38:44.864 --> 38:47.616
...Sir Henry Norris
and William Brereton.

38:47.951 --> 38:51.453
Both Smeaton and Brereton
have already confessed their guilt.

38:51.621 --> 38:55.040
We are come at the king's command
to conduct you to the Tower...

38:55.208 --> 38:59.086
...there to abide
during His Majesty's pleasure.

39:02.090 --> 39:05.050
If it be His Majesty's pleasure...

39:06.052 --> 39:08.470
...then l am ready to obey.

39:09.222 --> 39:11.682
-Lady Sheldon--
-No time to change your clothes...

39:11.850 --> 39:14.059
...or pack any of your things.

39:14.227 --> 39:17.104
Money will be provided
for your needs at the Tower.

39:44.591 --> 39:46.467
My lords, l beg you, before you go...

39:46.634 --> 39:49.970
...to beseech the king's grace
to be good to me.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.266
Madam, this way, l pray you.

40:14.746 --> 40:18.457
I pray God will help me, for there
is no truth in these allegations.

40:18.625 --> 40:20.167
This way.

40:29.677 --> 40:32.721
I am the king's true wedded wife.

40:34.265 --> 40:37.309
I'm not guilty of these charges.

40:39.312 --> 40:43.065
I am as free from the company of man
as l am from sin.

40:52.659 --> 40:54.660
Do I go in a dungeon, Mr. Kingston?

40:54.828 --> 40:55.953
No, madam.

40:56.121 --> 40:58.914
There are lodgings
made ready for you.

41:01.668 --> 41:04.044
It's too good for me.

41:04.921 --> 41:07.548
Jesus, have mercy on me.

41:08.007 --> 41:10.676
Thank you. Thank you.

41:17.350 --> 41:21.353
May I have the holy sacrament placed
in my room so I may pray for mercy?

41:30.864 --> 41:32.447
Greedy little cur.

41:32.615 --> 41:34.158
Your Grace.

41:36.744 --> 41:38.370
Your Eminence.

41:40.748 --> 41:42.541
Your Grace.

41:43.710 --> 41:45.752
I have just heard
of the queen's arrest.

41:46.796 --> 41:48.714
My mind is clean amazed.

41:48.882 --> 41:53.135
I cannot believe that she is guilty
of such abominable crimes.

41:58.433 --> 42:00.726
Yet l cannot think that the king...

42:00.894 --> 42:04.146
...would have proceeded so far
unless she was culpable.

42:04.314 --> 42:09.193
It has caused both the king and myself
a great pain to discover her deceit...

42:09.360 --> 42:11.320
...the depth of her depravity.

42:14.407 --> 42:16.325
The fact is, Mr. Cromwell...

42:16.492 --> 42:18.911
...that l loved her not a little
for the love...

42:19.078 --> 42:21.872
...which I judged her to bear
towards God and the Gospel.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.958
Next to His Grace, the king,
and yourself...

42:25.126 --> 42:28.629
...l was most bound to her
of all creatures living.

42:28.796 --> 42:31.423
-You must learn to live without her.
-Without her, look--

42:31.591 --> 42:33.759
Without her, is not our reformation
in danger?

42:33.927 --> 42:36.011
Was she not our great supporter
and advocate?

42:36.179 --> 42:38.639
Who would likely have become
our greatest liability.

42:39.515 --> 42:42.267
Sometimes, Your Grace,
in order to defeat evil...

42:42.435 --> 42:44.603
...one must learn to consort
with the devil.

42:47.774 --> 42:50.609
His Majesty is waiting for Your Grace
to discover a reason...

42:50.777 --> 42:54.821
...why his marriage to Anne Boleyn
should be considered null and void.

42:55.365 --> 42:56.949
He expects your verdict presently.

43:21.641 --> 43:23.642
What of the others?

43:24.352 --> 43:28.647
Smeaton, Brereton, Norris
and George Boleyn...

43:28.815 --> 43:30.899
...have been found guilty...

43:31.484 --> 43:34.027
...and are to be executed tomorrow.

43:38.408 --> 43:40.742
You know what Cromwell told me?

43:42.495 --> 43:46.164
He told me that she'd had to do
with over a hundred men.

43:48.293 --> 43:51.044
A hundred fucking men, Charles.

43:54.507 --> 43:56.091
You know what?

43:57.176 --> 43:59.344
You know what?
My daughter, Mary...

43:59.512 --> 44:00.929
...owes God a great deal...

44:01.973 --> 44:04.725
...for escaping the hands
of that poisoning whore.

44:05.310 --> 44:08.103
Oh, she planned to have her
poisoned, Charles, it's true.

44:08.271 --> 44:10.689
Just like she poisoned Catherine.

44:11.024 --> 44:12.649
We have proof.

44:13.067 --> 44:14.609
And her baby.

44:14.777 --> 44:17.779
Her baby was deformed.
Did you know that, Charles?

44:19.240 --> 44:21.783
So how could it have been mine?

44:25.371 --> 44:28.123
Perhaps Elizabeth isn't even mine.

44:29.876 --> 44:32.669
That fucking bitch.

44:59.405 --> 45:02.157
The queen was tried yesterday
at Westminster Hall.

45:03.493 --> 45:05.786
She pleaded not guilty
to all the charges...

45:05.953 --> 45:07.996
...but the evidence
being overwhelming...

45:08.164 --> 45:10.999
...she was sentenced to death,
by burning or decapitation...

45:11.167 --> 45:13.251
...according to the king's pleasure.

45:27.600 --> 45:30.685
And her accomplices?

45:31.104 --> 45:32.270
What of us?

45:32.772 --> 45:37.275
Smeaton, Brereton, Norris and
George Boleyn, all guilty as charged.

45:40.780 --> 45:42.364
Thomas...

45:42.532 --> 45:44.449
...what about me?

45:45.034 --> 45:47.119
Am l to be tried too?

45:48.663 --> 45:50.080
No.

45:50.248 --> 45:51.998
We found no evidence against you.

45:52.625 --> 45:54.626
You're to be released.

46:00.091 --> 46:01.633
Eventually.

46:06.722 --> 46:08.890
But l am the only one who's guilty!

46:19.026 --> 46:20.277
Charms.

46:20.445 --> 46:21.653
Lucky charms.

46:42.091 --> 46:44.843
-There he is.
-Traitor!

46:45.970 --> 46:49.347
Adulterer! Vermin!

46:53.644 --> 46:55.228
Evil!

47:09.702 --> 47:11.620
I say to you--

47:12.622 --> 47:15.290
I say to you, trust in God...

47:15.458 --> 47:17.709
...and not in the vanities
of this world.

47:19.253 --> 47:21.379
For if I had done so...

47:22.423 --> 47:24.925
...l think l would still be alive...

47:25.384 --> 47:26.885
...as you are now.

48:22.692 --> 48:24.776
Oh, God.

48:44.130 --> 48:45.297
Traitor.

49:02.523 --> 49:04.357
Traitor!

49:20.750 --> 49:23.585
These bloody days
Have broken my heart

49:23.753 --> 49:25.670
My lust, my youth did then depart

49:27.214 --> 49:31.384
For your wit alone
Many men would bemoan

49:31.927 --> 49:35.597
And since it is so
Many still cry aloud

49:35.765 --> 49:39.100
It is a great loss
That you are dead and gone

49:46.692 --> 49:49.194
The time you had
Above your poor degree

49:50.613 --> 49:53.365
Before whereof your friends
May well bemoan

49:54.533 --> 49:58.536
A rotten twig upon so high a tree

49:58.704 --> 50:01.873
Has slipped your hold
And you are dead

50:02.625 --> 50:04.376
And gone

50:23.688 --> 50:27.023
These bloody days
Have broken my heart

50:27.566 --> 50:32.237
My lust, my youth did then depart

50:33.322 --> 50:36.533
And blind desire of ambitious souls

50:37.159 --> 50:39.911
Who haste to climb

50:40.079 --> 50:42.414
Seeks to revert

50:42.915 --> 50:44.916
And about the throne

50:45.084 --> 50:47.419
The thunder rolls
