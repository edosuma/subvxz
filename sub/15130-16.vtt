00:00.001 --> 00:05.104
<i>(sam roberts band)</i>
<i>â™ª we're all in this together</i>

00:05.106 --> 00:07.673
<i>â™ª so give one...</i>

00:07.675 --> 00:09.141
<i>â™ª</i>

00:09.143 --> 00:12.211
Hey, enough.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.779
You've studied that transplant
inside and out.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.115
I've never operated on
a patient with c.F. Before.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.649
Hey, where are we?
I thought we stopped for coffee.

00:17.651 --> 00:18.784
(turns off engine)

00:21.187 --> 00:23.288
(exhales sharply)
joel, I need those.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.357
(beeping)

00:25.359 --> 00:28.694
Joel, I need this surgery
to be perfect.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.529
I can't kill
the miracle orphan.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.630
Is that what
he calls himself?

00:31.632 --> 00:32.731
The "miracle orphan"?

00:32.733 --> 00:37.803
Then why am I imagining
somebody in robes and sandals?

00:37.805 --> 00:39.671
He's an 18-year-old
with cystic fibrosis

00:39.673 --> 00:41.206
Whose mother abandoned
him at birth.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.674
Okay, now I feel really bad
about the whole

00:42.676 --> 00:44.810
Robes and sandals business.

00:44.812 --> 00:47.212
Carlos!
<i>Â¿cÃ³mo estÃ s?</i>
<i>Dr. G.</i>

00:47.214 --> 00:48.814
How you doin'?
<i>Â¿todo bien?</i>

00:48.816 --> 00:50.315
<i>Todo bien.</i>

00:50.317 --> 00:52.317
I got something special
for you today.
Love it.

00:52.319 --> 00:53.352
<i>Â¿listo?</i>
<i>SÃ­!</i>

00:53.354 --> 00:56.055
<i>VÃ¡mos.</i>
<i>Por supuesto.</i>

00:56.057 --> 01:00.459
<i>Â¿carlitos, tu hijo?</i>
<i>Â¿mi hijo?</i>
<i>'ta bien. Todo bien.</i>

01:00.461 --> 01:02.594
<i>Creciendo.</i>
<i>EstÃ  grande ahora.</i>

01:02.596 --> 01:05.197
<i>Â¿ves esto?</i>
<i>Check it out.</i>

01:06.599 --> 01:08.133
Came in fresh
this morning.

01:08.135 --> 01:10.536
Beautiful.
(chuckles)

01:10.538 --> 01:12.137
Fill your boots,
<i>pÃ pi.</i>

01:12.139 --> 01:14.373
<i>MuchÃ­simo gracias.</i>

01:14.375 --> 01:15.441
All right.

01:18.278 --> 01:20.846
(sighs) joel, I don't
have time for this.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.682
Alex, you're wound up
tight.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.217
I'm offering you
a little release here.

01:26.486 --> 01:28.087
(smash)

01:28.089 --> 01:30.222
(laughs)

01:30.224 --> 01:31.290
It's like therapy,
yeah?

01:31.292 --> 01:32.658
If I hit this,
can I go to work?

01:32.660 --> 01:35.160
Just one shot.
Miracle orphan.

01:35.162 --> 01:36.462
(sighs deeply)

01:36.464 --> 01:38.764
Okay.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.265
(grunts)

01:40.267 --> 01:42.234
(glass shatters)

01:44.170 --> 01:45.571
Is that good enough?

01:46.773 --> 01:47.806
(bat clatters)

01:47.808 --> 01:49.675
Let's go to work.

01:51.344 --> 01:52.411
Hey, where's reycraft?

01:52.413 --> 01:54.213
What's the status
on those lungs?

01:54.215 --> 01:56.682
(sighs) a trailer jackknifed
on the 401 near belleville.

01:56.684 --> 01:58.417
The whole highway shut down.
It's a parking lot.

01:58.419 --> 01:59.485
What?

01:59.487 --> 02:00.819
They're stuck in traffic?

02:00.821 --> 02:02.221
Let's do this,
dr. Reid.

02:02.223 --> 02:03.689
We'll see you in there,
connor.

02:03.691 --> 02:07.726
Ambulance can't
get through?
That's what they
told me.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.728
There's no guarantee
reycraft will get back

02:09.730 --> 02:13.899
(police siren wailing)

02:13.901 --> 02:16.235
(engine revving)

02:18.638 --> 02:20.172
Connor?

02:20.174 --> 02:21.840
I just wanted to let you know
that there's been

02:21.842 --> 02:24.510
A little bit of delay
getting your lungs here.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.278
You look worried,
dr. Reid.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.914
I'm not worried.
I'm just anxious to get started.

02:28.916 --> 02:34.453
(labored breathing)
but... Try not to worry.

02:34.455 --> 02:35.721
If it's meant to be, then--

02:35.723 --> 02:37.156
Connor, we are wheeling you
out of this o.R.

02:37.158 --> 02:39.358
With a healthy pair
of lungs, okay?

02:40.593 --> 02:46.331
(engine revving)

02:49.502 --> 02:53.205
(police siren continues wailing)

02:56.776 --> 02:59.711
When they start to bleed
it means they're clean.

02:59.713 --> 03:03.882
They'd better get here soon.
(sighs)

03:03.884 --> 03:05.551
(telephone rings)

03:07.587 --> 03:09.555
(tires screech)

03:09.557 --> 03:11.256
(turns off engine)

03:11.258 --> 03:12.457
(telephone rings)

03:15.295 --> 03:16.428
(siren wailing)

03:16.430 --> 03:18.263
You made it.

03:18.265 --> 03:19.665
Thanks for not
getting us killed.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.400
Thanks for holding on.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.869
Move, move, move!
Come on!

03:23.871 --> 03:25.637
We got it! We got it!

03:35.848 --> 03:37.349
Are you ready?

03:37.351 --> 03:39.451
See you on
the other side.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.853
Go ahead, baumann.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.923
Count backwards from 100.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.758
100...

03:46.760 --> 03:49.228
99...

03:49.230 --> 03:51.563
98...

03:51.565 --> 03:52.664
97...

03:55.235 --> 03:57.669
Ready to intubate.

03:57.671 --> 04:01.273
Not yet.

04:01.275 --> 04:06.311
(monitor beeping steadily)

04:11.584 --> 04:13.352
Wake him up.

04:13.354 --> 04:14.786
These lungs are dead.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.739
(coughing)

04:33.741 --> 04:35.474
Respiratory rate
is up to 30.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.508
(jackson) you want the bipap?

04:36.510 --> 04:37.643
Let's try
the nebulizer first.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.845
.5 ccs of albuterol
and saline.

04:39.847 --> 04:43.515
(panting) I can't catch...
My breath.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.851
Pulse 140, sats are 85
on room air.

04:45.853 --> 04:46.985
How's that mask?

04:46.987 --> 04:48.754
Right here.
(coughing continues)

04:52.992 --> 04:54.993
You're gonna be okay, connor.
(breathing deeply)

04:54.995 --> 04:56.028
Just try to rest now.

04:56.030 --> 04:58.530
(coughs)
good.

05:00.566 --> 05:01.633
You stay with him?

05:01.635 --> 05:02.901
Of course.

05:07.073 --> 05:10.575
<i>(woman speaking indistinctly</i>
<i>over p.A.)</i>

05:10.577 --> 05:13.512
Alex.
These just came in.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.747
Lung function is down
to 19%.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.582
We have 48 hours tops
before we have to

05:17.584 --> 05:18.583
Intubate him for good.

05:18.585 --> 05:21.453
Until I knew for sure
his lungs were good.

05:21.455 --> 05:22.554
Alex, you didn't
have a choice.

05:22.556 --> 05:26.692
Were there any fatalities
in the highway accident?

05:26.694 --> 05:28.327
(reycraft) uh,
not that I know of.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.728
I didn't stick around
to check, though.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.496
I grabbed the first bike
I saw and I took off.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.864
So I don't know.
Okay, well,
let's call around,

05:32.866 --> 05:34.599
Find out what happened
to the car crash victims.

05:34.601 --> 05:38.704
All right, done.
I'll start making the calls.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.105
We should call neil rocca,

05:40.107 --> 05:41.940
Chief of thoracic surgery
at memorial.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.375
If any donor lungs become
available,

05:43.377 --> 05:46.011
He'll be the first to know.
All right, on it.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.081
Good morning.

05:49.083 --> 05:50.449
It certainly is.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.717
Okay, why are you making
that face?

05:51.719 --> 05:52.851
I couldn't help but notice
that you and alex

05:52.853 --> 05:54.086
Came into work together
today.

05:54.088 --> 05:57.089
Didn't realize it was
a source of potential gossip.

05:57.091 --> 05:59.791
So... You and alex,
just friends?

05:59.793 --> 06:02.394
Is that so difficult
to believe, maggie?

06:02.396 --> 06:03.829
Joel, how old are you?

06:03.831 --> 06:05.130
Still haven't learned that

06:05.132 --> 06:07.966
Men <i>cannot</i> be friends
with their exes.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.135
Well... You and I
are still friends.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.704
Are we not? Hmm?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.606
Aah, my wife is
trying to kill me!

06:14.608 --> 06:15.674
Ex-wife!

06:15.676 --> 06:18.477
You have the papers
with you right now.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.045
Bring 'em.
I'll sign 'em.
Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna bring them,

06:20.047 --> 06:21.747
And you will sign them,
and I'll hand you the pen.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.882
(joel) zach, talk to me.
What's happening?

06:23.884 --> 06:25.817
Uh, louie garvey fell
while painting his house.

06:25.819 --> 06:28.019
That is paint,
that's a relief.
(groans)

06:28.021 --> 06:31.456
A ladder fell on
mrs. Bridgette garvey.

06:31.458 --> 06:32.557
I'm changing my name back

06:32.559 --> 06:34.025
As soon that divorce
goes through.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.861
Okay, you wanna go back to
being known as

06:35.863 --> 06:37.763
Bridgette bridgestone,
you be my guest.

06:37.765 --> 06:41.466
Okay, could we separate them.
Maggie, take--all right.
You're a walking disaster.

06:41.468 --> 06:42.734
Mrs. Garvey,
if you wouldn't mind--
bridgestone.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.936
Bridgestone.
Take her to bed two, please.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.406
Bed two, now.
(louie)
those are my shoes!

06:47.408 --> 06:49.674
(velcro rips)
hello, hi.

06:49.676 --> 06:53.412
(louie) everywhere.
Vanessa, scissors,
please. Thank you.

06:55.047 --> 06:58.517
Okay, I'm gonna need a c.T.
Scan of the patient's head.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.519
It's my leg.
It's killing me.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.520
Okay.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.488
(groaning)

07:05.491 --> 07:06.758
Okay, let's get
his clothes off,

07:06.760 --> 07:07.759
Get him to imaging.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.628
I need x-rays of every
extremity.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.530
Sounds good.
X-rays on every extremity.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.064
What the...
Let's go.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.600
(wheels rattle)

07:15.602 --> 07:18.570
"she wanted sebastian
to kiss her.

07:18.572 --> 07:21.540
Even if it meant
total surrender."

07:21.542 --> 07:23.742
Mr. Devonshire,
do you ever take a break?

07:23.744 --> 07:26.011
Oh, violet was in
a book club

07:26.013 --> 07:28.079
With the ladies in
the neighborhood.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.648
She never missed a book.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.149
Romance novels?

07:31.151 --> 07:35.153
The problems
of modern womanhood.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.022
Well, her white blood cell
count is down.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.157
Which means the antibotics
are working to help

07:39.159 --> 07:41.626
Fight the infection.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.062
And once the osteomyeltis
clears up,

07:44.064 --> 07:45.964
She'll have a better chance
of waking up.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.699
(monitor beeping steadily)

07:47.701 --> 07:50.669
It's our anniversary
tomorrow.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.805
32 years of marriage.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.807
These last three weeks
are the longest...

07:55.809 --> 07:58.944
(inhales deeply)

07:58.946 --> 08:01.146
(voice breaking) I've gone
without hearing her voice.

08:01.148 --> 08:05.584
I had a patient in July
with a-a similar condition,

08:05.586 --> 08:09.754
And, um, he managed to make
a full recovery.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.857
Well, I should get back
to this.

08:15.127 --> 08:18.196
"yolanda tried to fight
the feelings bubbling up

08:18.198 --> 08:22.167
"inside her like a volcano
threatening...

08:22.169 --> 08:27.772
To engulf her,
to swallow her whole."

08:27.774 --> 08:30.942
We spent every penny we earned
trying to make that house

08:30.944 --> 08:32.911
Our dream home,
and now we have to sell it

08:32.913 --> 08:35.013
Because he can't afford
to buy me out.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.015
We don't you keep it
and buy him out?

08:37.017 --> 08:38.083
Because I hate it.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.085
Fair enough.

08:40.087 --> 08:45.891
We had to repaint the exterior
to increase curb appeal.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.759
So... (grunts)

08:47.761 --> 08:49.060
(lid clicks)

08:49.062 --> 08:50.762
The open house is tomorrow.
Of course,

08:50.764 --> 08:52.197
He leaves it
to the last minute.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.532
Classic.
Mm.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.634
So I go over there to
confront him,

08:55.636 --> 08:59.638
Louie's on the ground,
the ladder's on top of me.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.873
Which, by the way,
is the first thing that's been

09:01.875 --> 09:03.642
On top of me in months.
Good news.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.844
You don't seem to have
any internal injuries.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.880
Just a couple of
bruised ribs, okay?

09:08.882 --> 09:11.683
Okay, louie,
x-rays show, yes,

09:11.685 --> 09:13.652
You have
a closed tibial fracture

09:13.654 --> 09:15.053
And dislocated shoulder.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.088
Shoulder I can deal with
right now.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.823
Gonna warn you,
this will hurt.

09:18.825 --> 09:19.991
Let's get him
some lidocaine

09:19.993 --> 09:21.293
And, uh,
get me a sheet, please.

09:21.295 --> 09:22.694
(louie) you know,
everything's fine.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.195
I'm up the ladder,
I'm painting the house.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.698
Bridgette comes over
and she starts right in on me.

09:26.700 --> 09:30.035
"that is not the red I chose.
I chose safari sunset."

09:30.037 --> 09:32.337
The only safari that chick's
ever seen is "the lion king."

09:32.339 --> 09:33.638
That's a <i>great</i> movie.

09:33.640 --> 09:39.311
Anyway, uh, the ladder buckled,
and I'm on the ground.

09:39.313 --> 09:41.880
Ouch. That hurts.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.648
Then you're gonna love this.
Lift your head up

09:43.650 --> 09:45.050
Just a little bit
for me there.
There we go.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.885
Thank you.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.219
Ready for this?

09:48.221 --> 09:52.791
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.893
(exhales)

09:54.895 --> 09:56.928
(groaning)

09:56.930 --> 09:58.363
Gently... Good.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.231
There we go. Okay.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.001
Here we go.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.302
(crack)
(groans)

10:04.304 --> 10:06.271
Let's get him something
for the pain right now.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.607
Lovely. Thank you.

10:08.609 --> 10:11.676
So, louie, when you fell,
how'd you land?

10:11.678 --> 10:15.880
On my right foot and then,
you know, the rest, my body.

10:15.882 --> 10:16.915
Okay, well, your tibia's
fractured underneath

10:16.917 --> 10:20.018
This is not the kind of thing
that's gonna heal by itself.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.821
So let's get you
into surgery.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.623
Surgery?

10:24.625 --> 10:25.824
Yes. Uh...

10:25.826 --> 10:29.327
I have a spot here
the day after tomorrow.

10:29.329 --> 10:31.763
I want you to call
the cops.

10:31.765 --> 10:36.301
She did this on purpose.
So I want you to call the cops,

10:36.303 --> 10:38.336
And so they can come,
and they can charge her

10:38.338 --> 10:41.072
With conspiracy to commit
murder or whatever.

10:41.074 --> 10:43.174
(laughing)

10:43.176 --> 10:45.043
You think this is funny?

10:45.045 --> 10:48.013
Ah, hysterical,
yeah.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.181
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:50.183 --> 10:53.051
Whoa, whoa!
(screaming)

10:53.053 --> 10:56.321
Oh, that is <i>not</i> good.
Everyone, calm down.
Here we go.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.757
What did you... (gasps)

10:58.759 --> 11:00.659
Oh! Oh!
It's okay.
Come back to bed.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.827
(bridgette) oh, my god.
(joel) this is not good.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.863
Morphine, please.
Um...

11:04.865 --> 11:06.998
Okay, what's wrong with
my leg?
I don't recommend
looking at it.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.433
Let's, uh,
get him in the o.R.

11:08.435 --> 11:12.103
Okay, here we go.
Let's go, let's go!
(joel) move!

11:12.105 --> 11:14.906
Good news--
his head is okay.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.776
Okay.

11:22.782 --> 11:24.382
Looking for something?

11:24.384 --> 11:27.919
Yeah. I had a-an osteomyelitis
patient earlier this year

11:27.921 --> 11:30.088
And I wanted to review
the file.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.323
Now I can't seem
to find it.

11:32.325 --> 11:35.460
Come to think of it,
none of my case files are here.

11:35.462 --> 11:39.764
Ask dawn. She was poking around
there this morning.

11:39.766 --> 11:41.466
Did she say
what she was looking for?

11:41.468 --> 11:44.035
Something about revamping
the filing system.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.904
Although, if you ask me,
the chief of surgery
(slams drawer)

11:45.906 --> 11:48.039
Should have better
things... To do.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.008
And I'm talking to myself.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.811
(dawn) part of the rumors
circulating about...

11:52.813 --> 11:56.381
(siren wailing in distance)

11:56.383 --> 11:57.949
Dr. Bell?

11:57.951 --> 12:00.819
Can I help you with something,
dr. Harris?

12:03.322 --> 12:05.323
Everything all right,
dr. Bell?

12:05.325 --> 12:06.925
Everything's fine.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.227
Dr. Murphy,
may I have a quick word?

12:12.264 --> 12:14.999
Just take a minute.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.367
I'd like you to come
and see me tonight

12:16.369 --> 12:17.769
Before you leave,
dr. Harris.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.176
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

12:25.178 --> 12:26.845
Dr. Bell just wants to ask
a few questions

12:26.847 --> 12:27.946
About your behavior.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.814
What kind of questions?

12:29.816 --> 12:33.318
Charlie, as your doctor,
I cannot disclose anything

12:33.320 --> 12:34.953
That goes on
in our sessions.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.188
I mean, even if I could,
what would I say?

12:37.190 --> 12:39.090
You had some concerns
about your mental health.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.893
We've addressed them,
treatment's going well.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.161
Medication is working.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.396
You're taking
your medication, right?

12:45.398 --> 12:48.066
Of course.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.468
So there's nothing
to worry about.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.238
Everything is fine.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.472
I should get back in there.

13:03.315 --> 13:04.849
(closes door)

13:12.191 --> 13:13.925
(closes drawer)

13:21.167 --> 13:24.369
Thank you, gavin.
You are the best.

13:25.337 --> 13:27.338
(keys thud)

13:28.407 --> 13:30.575
(whispers) okay,
before you say anything,

13:30.577 --> 13:32.877
Yes, I can see you.
No, you're not dead.

13:32.879 --> 13:34.345
You're in a coma.
<i>But you can see me?</i>

13:34.347 --> 13:38.416
We really need to have
this conversation--
<i>this is weird.</i>

13:38.418 --> 13:40.485
<i>Isn't there something</i>
<i>you can do for me?</i>

13:43.956 --> 13:46.491
Maybe there's something
<i>you</i> can do for <i>me.</i>

13:46.493 --> 13:49.194
(coughing)

13:49.196 --> 13:50.829
That's 15 minutes.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.864
Let's get him
back on the nebulizer.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.432
Same cocktail?
Yes.

13:54.434 --> 13:57.335
Hand me another towel,
please.

13:57.337 --> 14:02.006
(coughing)

14:02.008 --> 14:04.008
Good man.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.510
Can you imagine
if every time

14:05.512 --> 14:07.378
You coughed up
a wad of mucus,

14:07.380 --> 14:08.546
People cheered?

14:08.548 --> 14:11.883
No, I can't.
(breathing deeply)

14:11.885 --> 14:16.020
Just a few more breaths
for me.

14:16.022 --> 14:19.357
This is me in a cape.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.459
(chuckles)

14:21.461 --> 14:23.094
From the kids
from the c.F. Clinic?

14:23.096 --> 14:24.295
Mm-hmm.

14:24.297 --> 14:28.499
This one's from jamie.
He's 10.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.903
Spent his last two birthdays
in the hospital.

14:31.905 --> 14:34.372
This one's from mackenzie.

14:34.374 --> 14:38.243
Her twin sister died
of c.F. Two years ago.

14:40.312 --> 14:42.547
Everything okay?

14:42.549 --> 14:44.616
It's just...

14:44.618 --> 14:47.485
Being the c.F. Poster boy,

14:47.487 --> 14:49.921
It's a lot of pressure.

14:51.023 --> 14:53.091
You give them hope.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.126
So when I'm gone?

14:55.128 --> 14:58.263
We're a long way
from that, connor.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.032
We're not giving up yet.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.401
(singsongy) someone here
to see you.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.336
Hey, cade.
Hey.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.538
(imitates explosion)
(alex) okay, six feet back.
You know the rules.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.141
No cross-contamination.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.377
This is cade.
He's one of my friends

15:12.379 --> 15:13.478
From the c.F. Clinic.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.480
He just wanted to
come by to say hi.

15:17.182 --> 15:18.650
Make sure
you got the cards.

15:18.652 --> 15:21.653
I barely have enough room
to put 'em all.

15:21.655 --> 15:23.354
The red one's mine.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.623
Here.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.126
I love it, thank you.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.094
You get your new lungs?

15:30.096 --> 15:31.629
Um...

15:31.631 --> 15:35.233
Minor glitch,
but they're working on it.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.035
Right, dr. Reid?

15:39.171 --> 15:41.306
Absolutely.

15:45.412 --> 15:49.614
All right, well,
you have my cell number.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.182
Thanks.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.617
Anything promising?

15:52.619 --> 15:54.686
Everyone in that accident
pulled through.

15:54.688 --> 15:56.955
Did you call dr. Rocca?

15:56.957 --> 16:01.659
Alex, there aren't
any lungs coming.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.729
(siren wailing in distance)

16:09.668 --> 16:10.969
(monitor beeping)

16:10.971 --> 16:13.037
Okay, just a little further.

16:13.039 --> 16:14.672
All righty.

16:14.674 --> 16:17.141
Guidewire is in place.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.043
Pass the rod.

16:19.045 --> 16:21.379
Thank you.

16:21.381 --> 16:24.315
(instrument clicking)

16:28.554 --> 16:29.988
Time to
earn the big bucks.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.090
Hammer.

16:34.626 --> 16:38.096
(metal clinking)

16:42.369 --> 16:47.105
<i>You want me to sneak into</i>
<i>the chief of surgery's office</i>

16:47.107 --> 16:48.740
<i>And eavesdrop</i>
<i>on the conversation</i>

16:48.742 --> 16:51.009
<i>She's having with</i>
<i>your psychiatrist?</i>

16:51.011 --> 16:54.512
<i>I don't know, doctor.</i>
<i>I-I don't feel good</i>

16:54.514 --> 16:59.317
<i>About listening in on</i>
<i>people's private conversations.</i>

16:59.319 --> 17:01.152
(whispers) you're a ghost.
That's kind of what you do.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.621
<i>Well,</i>
<i>it--it, it's difficult.</i>

17:03.623 --> 17:05.790
<i>But I-I</i> really <i>try</i>
<i>not to eavesdrop.</i>

17:05.792 --> 17:07.291
Okay.

17:07.293 --> 17:08.693
You're a principled woman,
and I respect that.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.795
But my job may be
on the line here.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.230
So <i>please.</i>

17:12.232 --> 17:14.265
<i>Why? Have you done</i>
<i>something wrong?</i>

17:14.267 --> 17:16.434
(groans) that's what we need
to go find out.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.036
<i>(whispers) oh.</i>

17:18.038 --> 17:19.804
Then I'll help you.

17:19.806 --> 17:23.374
<i>Oh, I see. Tit for tat.</i>

17:23.376 --> 17:25.610
<i>I-I scratch your back,</i>
<i>you scratch mine.</i>

17:25.612 --> 17:27.712
Right.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.314
Office,
end of the hall.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.199
Leaving the o.R.
In the middle of a surgery?

17:48.201 --> 17:51.302
Does that seem like sound
surgical practice to you?

17:51.304 --> 17:53.671
I'm not a surgeon.
Wouldn't know.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.573
Don't get cute with me.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.776
Dr. Bell, I have patients
to see this morning.

17:58.778 --> 18:02.280
Is one of those patients
charlie?

18:02.282 --> 18:05.450
I've seen him leaving
your office.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.285
You know I can't discuss
a patient with you.

18:07.287 --> 18:10.388
Dr. Murphy, I am just trying
to get to the bottom of this

18:10.390 --> 18:12.390
Before someone gets hurt.

18:12.392 --> 18:16.294
If the college starts digging
and they find...

18:16.296 --> 18:17.662
Charlie could lose
his license.

18:17.664 --> 18:20.531
If I shared your concern,
I would say so.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.668
Okay.

18:23.670 --> 18:24.802
If maggie was hurt,

18:24.804 --> 18:27.738
Would you let charlie
operate on her?

18:36.215 --> 18:40.251
(lowered voice)
I don't believe this.

18:40.253 --> 18:43.888
<i>He just... Didn't</i>
<i>answer the question.</i>

18:43.890 --> 18:46.424
Yeah, not exactly
a glowing endorsement.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.559
<i>No, I suppose not.</i>

18:48.561 --> 18:52.330
She actually said
I could lose my license?

18:52.332 --> 18:57.435
<i>If there</i>
<i>was an investigation, yes.</i>

18:57.437 --> 19:00.538
<i>Well, if it's an consolation,</i>
<i>the two of them</i>

19:00.540 --> 19:02.773
<i>Seem to care an awful lot</i>
<i>about you.</i>

19:02.775 --> 19:04.342
It's not.

19:09.214 --> 19:11.816
<i>So... Tit for tat.</i>

19:11.818 --> 19:17.221
<i>What I need from you is to</i>
<i>tell my husband to move on.</i>

19:17.223 --> 19:20.892
<i>Otherwise, he'll just waste</i>
<i>his life, sitting there,</i>

19:20.894 --> 19:22.627
<i>Waiting for me to wake up.</i>

19:45.751 --> 19:47.752
We can put him on
a novalung.

19:47.754 --> 19:48.920
It's not a total fix,

19:48.922 --> 19:50.421
But we can bridge him
for a few weeks

19:50.423 --> 19:51.689
While we wait
for new donor lungs.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.424
No, his immune system
is already compromised.

19:53.426 --> 19:56.427
With implanting a novalung
might be too high.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.296
Well, we can put him
in isolation to protect him.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.798
He'll have a lower
post-op success rate.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.899
Not that much lower.

20:01.901 --> 20:02.967
But it's lower.

20:02.969 --> 20:06.237
(cell phone vibrates)

20:06.239 --> 20:08.773
Dr. Reycraft speaking.

20:08.775 --> 20:11.709
Uh, we're in the lounge.
Why?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.945
What?

20:13.947 --> 20:15.780
Oh, okay. O-okay,
okay.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.381
Did they find us
some lungs?

20:17.383 --> 20:19.250
No.

20:19.252 --> 20:20.585
But dr. Rocca is here.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.687
What?

20:27.960 --> 20:29.293
Dr. Rocca.

20:29.295 --> 20:30.628
Dr. Reid.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.296
I heard my favorite intern
had a problem

20:32.298 --> 20:33.764
With a set of lungs
this morning.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.333
Now you must be dr. Reycraft.
You're the one

20:35.335 --> 20:36.601
That pulled the stunt
on the motorcycle?

20:36.603 --> 20:37.868
Yes.

20:37.870 --> 20:38.869
Reckless.

20:38.871 --> 20:42.340
This is
dr. Shaf keshavjee.

20:42.342 --> 20:43.941
Dr. Keshavjee, I've heard
so much about you.

20:43.943 --> 20:44.976
It's an honor.

20:44.978 --> 20:46.711
Nice to meet you both.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.579
What are you doing here?

20:48.581 --> 20:51.315
Well, our morning opened up,
and I thought we'd bring you

20:51.317 --> 20:53.284
A little gift.

20:53.286 --> 20:54.852
(alex) is that
what I think it is?
(dr. Rocca) oh, yeah.

20:54.854 --> 20:55.886
You got it to work?

20:55.888 --> 20:58.556
Damn right we did.

20:59.925 --> 21:03.961
Still got those lungs?

21:03.963 --> 21:05.329
Oh!

21:21.680 --> 21:23.881
How are you feeling,
connor?

21:31.490 --> 21:33.357
(coughing)

21:33.359 --> 21:36.560
Dr. Reid,
I want you to know

21:36.562 --> 21:41.532
That I really appreciate
everything you'd done.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.401
I'm not ready for your
farewell speech.

21:43.403 --> 21:47.538
I think maybe it's time
you did, too.

21:47.540 --> 21:48.606
Connor--

21:48.608 --> 21:50.708
My lungs are shutting down,

21:50.710 --> 21:54.578
And I am going to die...
Soon.

21:54.580 --> 21:58.049
I'm out of miracles, alex.

21:58.051 --> 22:00.351
Well, I'm not.

22:02.387 --> 22:04.088
Okay, louie,
it's completely normal

22:04.090 --> 22:06.557
For your throat to be
a bit sore after surgery

22:06.559 --> 22:07.792
Because of the intubation.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.760
Let me introduce you
to your new leg.

22:09.762 --> 22:12.897
Getting through airport security
but you're all right.

22:12.899 --> 22:14.665
He doesn't like to travel.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.067
Bridgette, what are you
doing here?

22:16.069 --> 22:18.836
Did you change the locks?

22:18.838 --> 22:21.105
Oh, my god.
He changed the locks.

22:21.107 --> 22:25.376
The open house is tomorrow.
Can I have the damn key, please?

22:25.378 --> 22:26.877
(whispers) awkward.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.482
(objects clatter)

22:31.484 --> 22:32.717
Thank you.

22:32.719 --> 22:33.818
See you later, gimpy.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.052
(hoarse voice)
good riddance.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.423
What's wrong with my voice?

22:39.425 --> 22:41.859
(chuckles) you sound like
kathleen turner right now.

22:41.861 --> 22:42.960
Seriously,
what's wrong with my voice?

22:42.962 --> 22:43.994
Open your mouth
for me.

22:43.996 --> 22:50.134
Ahh.

22:50.136 --> 22:53.838
Louie, can you clear your throat
and count to five for us?

22:53.840 --> 22:58.576
(clears throat) one...
Two... Th--okay.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.945
There's something.
It's--this is wrong.

23:00.947 --> 23:03.447
Louie, one of
your vocal cords

23:03.449 --> 23:05.049
Might be experiencing
a degree of paralysis.

23:05.051 --> 23:06.550
Paralysis?
Yeah.

23:06.552 --> 23:10.588
Well, that's not usually--
this is all your fault.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.523
Are you for real?!
This is...
(speaking indistinctly)

23:12.525 --> 23:15.126
Okay, come with me.
How is this my fault?

23:15.128 --> 23:17.595
(shouting over each other)
why do you blame
everything on me?

23:17.597 --> 23:21.165
Let's just take this outside,
please, okay?
Oh, my god.

23:21.167 --> 23:22.733
Take a few deep breaths
for me.
(inhales deeply)

23:22.735 --> 23:24.502
Can you do that?

23:24.504 --> 23:26.070
Yeah. Sorry.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.739
Louie's recovery's gonna be
a very painful one, all right?

23:28.741 --> 23:31.909
I think it might be best
if the two of you

23:31.911 --> 23:33.043
Just separate
for a little while.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.578
I'm not a bad person.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.113
Nobody's saying you are.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.548
Okay, look, relationships
are complicated.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.817
I understand.

23:39.819 --> 23:43.120
(scoffs) when we bought
this house,

23:43.122 --> 23:45.189
We were gonna fix it up
and make it perfect

23:45.191 --> 23:47.658
And grow old together.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.860
And then we just couldn't
agree on anything.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.630
Well, then, I hope
the open house goes well,

23:52.632 --> 23:54.064
'cause it sounds to me
like it's best for both of you

23:54.066 --> 23:56.100
Once you move on.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.735
Yeah.

23:57.737 --> 23:59.203
I've been horrible,
haven't I?

24:00.906 --> 24:02.740
He drives me crazy,

24:02.742 --> 24:05.776
But I don't want to
see him suffer.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.178
I don't.

24:07.180 --> 24:09.914
So is there anything
I can do before I go?

24:09.916 --> 24:11.782
Why don't you go down
to the cafeteria

24:11.784 --> 24:13.651
And get him some soup
or something?

24:13.653 --> 24:15.085
He missed his lunch, so...

24:15.087 --> 24:17.788
Okay.
Okay?

24:17.790 --> 24:20.057
Thank you, doctor,
for being so kind.

24:20.059 --> 24:23.194
(clears throat) I certainly
haven't earned it.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.738
You must be connor.

24:34.740 --> 24:37.074
I'm dr. Rocca.

24:37.076 --> 24:40.978
Hey, wanna see
something cool?

24:45.918 --> 24:51.789
<i>That</i> is the ex vivo
lung perfusion machine

24:51.791 --> 24:54.825
Or as the cool kids used
to call it, the e.V.L.P.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.861
I like to call it the <i>evlp.</i>

24:56.863 --> 24:59.530
(chuckles) it allows us
to nurse lungs

24:59.532 --> 25:01.665
To optimum health
before they're transplanted.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.101
Those are the lungs
from this morning.

25:04.103 --> 25:08.806
But I... I thought
they were no good.

25:08.808 --> 25:11.175
They weren't. We're fixing them.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.010
See, your new lungs are
hooked up to

25:13.012 --> 25:15.279
A ventilator and some pumps
and some filters,

25:15.281 --> 25:17.281
And we are treating them
with a solution

25:17.283 --> 25:18.916
And with all kinds of nutrients

25:18.918 --> 25:21.185
And medication
and unicorn tears.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.087
As the lungs breathe
on their own,

25:23.089 --> 25:24.154
The solution works
its way through them,

25:24.156 --> 25:25.923
And helps them heal.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.157
Hey, you a baseball fan?

25:27.159 --> 25:28.259
Sure.

25:28.261 --> 25:30.027
Yeah, me, too.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.029
You see the retractable roof?

25:32.031 --> 25:33.898
We modeled it after
the skydome.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.633
You invented this thing?

25:35.635 --> 25:37.301
Well, me with dr. Keshavjee.

25:37.303 --> 25:39.203
They've been working
on it for years.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.805
Could I have a moment?

25:47.078 --> 25:49.747
We'll be right outside.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.758
Thank you for the machine.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.993
Well, I was using it to keep
an old sponge cake alive,

26:02.995 --> 26:05.296
But I figured this probably
took precedence.

26:05.298 --> 26:07.598
You're still telling
lame jokes.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.067
Hey, I got a million of them.
Ain't none of 'em funny.

26:10.069 --> 26:15.039
And you still get that
worried look in your eyes.

26:15.041 --> 26:17.174
How are you, alex?

26:17.176 --> 26:18.909
How much time do you have?

26:18.911 --> 26:21.178
For you, I got all
the time in the w--
(cell phone rings)

26:21.180 --> 26:22.746
(clicks tongue,
inhales deeply)

26:22.748 --> 26:24.615
So close.

26:24.617 --> 26:25.716
Oh, I think I won
a cruise.

26:25.718 --> 26:28.152
Go.
(ring)

26:28.154 --> 26:29.320
Dr. Rocca here.

26:31.189 --> 26:33.824
(rocca) yeah.

26:48.106 --> 26:50.641
(whispers) listen.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.242
You've been in a coma
for three weeks.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.278
Three weeks.
That's hardly game over.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.913
Trust me. I would know.

26:55.915 --> 26:57.114
<i>I-I-I'm not gonna wake up,</i>
<i>charlie.</i>

26:57.116 --> 27:00.117
<i>I can feel it deep down.</i>

27:00.119 --> 27:02.086
I am not gonna ask that man
to give up on you.

27:02.088 --> 27:04.722
He has been in that room,
at your side,

27:04.724 --> 27:07.625
All day, every day,
reading those books.

27:07.627 --> 27:09.093
<i>Those books are horrible.</i>

27:09.095 --> 27:12.863
<i>I only joined a book club</i>
<i>so I could drink wine</i>

27:12.865 --> 27:14.865
<i>And eat cheese</i>
<i>with my friends.</i>

27:14.867 --> 27:16.800
I can't deal with this
right now.

27:16.802 --> 27:19.937
I'm saving my job.
<i>But you promised me</i>
<i>you'd help me.</i>

27:19.939 --> 27:21.972
I don't care what
I promised you,

27:21.974 --> 27:24.174
Or what you <i>think</i> you need,
okay?

27:24.176 --> 27:25.709
Not today.

27:34.085 --> 27:36.687
(monitor beeping steadily)

27:36.689 --> 27:37.988
(rocca) all right,
ladies and gentlemen,

27:37.990 --> 27:40.090
We are here to perform
a bilateral sequential

27:40.092 --> 27:42.159
Lung transplant on
an 18-year-old male

27:42.161 --> 27:44.028
With cystic fibrosis.

27:44.030 --> 27:46.330
Okay, you ready?
Ready.

27:46.332 --> 27:49.199
All right,
give the lady a knife.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.834
You want me to
take the lead?

27:50.836 --> 27:53.270
Well, you're the expert
you're here now.

27:53.272 --> 27:54.905
I haven't done
a lung transplant

27:54.907 --> 27:56.040
On a patient with c.F.

27:56.042 --> 27:58.375
(under breath)
alex, let's go.

28:05.950 --> 28:07.851
Victor.

28:10.922 --> 28:13.891
(sighs)

28:16.861 --> 28:20.164
Welcome to thoracic park.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.099
(laughter)

28:28.039 --> 28:30.708
Oh, I'm tired.
I need caffeine so bad.

28:30.710 --> 28:32.176
So get yourself a coffee.

28:32.178 --> 28:35.312
I can't. I promised gavin
I'd only have one cup a day.

28:35.314 --> 28:36.847
Why on earth would you
do that?

28:36.849 --> 28:39.183
Makes me jittery.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.152
So eat spinach.

28:42.154 --> 28:44.088
It'll give you, like,
a magnesium boost.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.389
Joel.
Mm-hmm?

28:45.391 --> 28:47.324
Woman complains.
Mm-hmm.

28:47.326 --> 28:49.927
She wants sympathy,
not nutritional advice.

28:49.929 --> 28:53.764
It's what I like to call
nutritional sympathy.

28:53.766 --> 28:55.065
You've gotta read
between the lines with me.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.834
I'm mysterious, almost.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.135
Like a complicated onion.

28:58.137 --> 29:01.205
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

29:01.207 --> 29:02.906
I'm glad
we remained friends.

29:02.908 --> 29:08.779
But if you think you can
do the same with alex,

29:08.781 --> 29:11.048
You're kidding yourself.

29:11.050 --> 29:12.816
What are you saying?

29:12.818 --> 29:14.418
She's the one
that got away.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.419
<i>(woman over p.A.)</i>
<i>dr. Go ran, dr. Lin.</i>

29:15.421 --> 29:17.221
<i>Please report to room c-28.</i>

29:17.223 --> 29:18.889
It's louie's room.
Yes.

29:20.391 --> 29:21.525
What's going on?

29:21.527 --> 29:23.193
He's having
trouble swallowing.
Okay.

29:25.396 --> 29:27.164
There's eggs in that soup.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.066
She must've put eggs
in that soup.

29:29.068 --> 29:30.334
She knows I'm allergic.

29:30.336 --> 29:31.468
Airway's closing.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.137
Uh, hit me with .4 megs
epinephrine.

29:33.139 --> 29:34.204
Way ahead of you.

29:34.206 --> 29:35.272
Thank you.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.374
Just try and relax,
louie.

29:37.376 --> 29:40.110
Any better?

29:40.112 --> 29:42.312
Wait for it.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.815
Anything?

29:44.817 --> 29:47.251
There has to be something else
going on here.

29:47.253 --> 29:50.187
My ex-wife's trying
to kill me.

29:56.995 --> 29:58.796
We gave him
an anti-inflammatory

29:58.798 --> 29:59.897
To ease the swelling.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.098
He's sedated
and comfortable.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.800
I don't get it.

30:02.802 --> 30:05.102
Look it,
the x-rays look normal.

30:05.104 --> 30:07.337
I have no idea what's
causing these manifestations.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.072
What about the head c.T.
Shahir ran?

30:09.074 --> 30:10.841
Absolutely clear.

30:10.843 --> 30:14.278
Let me bring it up
anyway.
Go for it.

30:18.216 --> 30:19.850
It's normal.
Yeah.

30:19.852 --> 30:22.853
No skull contusions,
no cranial swelling.

30:22.855 --> 30:23.954
(sighs)
hold on.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.455
What's that?

30:28.059 --> 30:30.160
He has a sternoclavicular
joint dislocation.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.462
Okay, so, we didn't
paralyze his vocal cords,

30:32.464 --> 30:33.964
And his wife isn't
trying to kill him.

30:33.966 --> 30:35.299
His ex-wife.

30:37.001 --> 30:39.503
(monitor beeping steadily)

30:39.505 --> 30:42.472
This stuff is like tar.

30:42.474 --> 30:43.574
Scar tissue and mucus.

30:43.576 --> 30:46.476
It's like
biological superglue.

30:46.478 --> 30:50.047
I can't see where his lungs end
and his ribcage begins.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.615
Damn it!

30:51.617 --> 30:54.151
I nicked a vessel.
Suction.

30:54.153 --> 30:57.120
(suction gurgles)

31:02.861 --> 31:04.194
Okay, we're good.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.063
Slow down, dr. Reid.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.497
You only get
one shot at this.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.166
You wanna do it right
the first time.

31:09.168 --> 31:11.468
Right.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.370
Okay, main vessels
are dissected.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.138
Stapler.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.141
(stapler clicks)

31:21.246 --> 31:23.247
Mets.

31:25.984 --> 31:28.252
(beeping)
one more snip.

31:32.490 --> 31:34.992
Okay, we're clear.
Reycraft.

31:34.994 --> 31:36.660
Okay, all right.

31:36.662 --> 31:39.162
Come to papa.

31:45.270 --> 31:46.403
<i>(clears throat)</i>

31:51.976 --> 31:55.178
Well, you found me.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.014
Big surprise.

31:57.016 --> 31:59.316
<i>What are you doing</i>
<i>down here?</i>

32:01.319 --> 32:05.355
Whatever it takes
to make you disappear.

32:08.493 --> 32:10.627
<i>How many of those</i>
<i>have you taken?</i>

32:10.629 --> 32:15.499
<i>How many of those pills</i>
<i>have you taken today?</i>

32:15.501 --> 32:18.168
<i>I think you should call</i>
<i>dr. Murphy</i>

32:18.170 --> 32:20.504
<i>And tell him where you are</i>
<i>and what you did.</i>

32:20.506 --> 32:21.605
I didn't do anything.

32:21.607 --> 32:24.174
I just... Wanted you
to go away.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.714
<i>Charlie.</i>

32:30.716 --> 32:32.115
<i>Charlie!</i>

32:49.334 --> 32:51.068
Okay.

32:58.676 --> 33:00.444
Bronchus is attached.

33:03.381 --> 33:04.548
Fill it up, george.

33:09.120 --> 33:12.356
Removing the cooling jacket.

33:14.058 --> 33:15.726
All right, let's see
what this kid can do.

33:15.728 --> 33:17.094
Wait.

33:17.096 --> 33:18.729
What is it?

33:18.731 --> 33:20.564
Well, you said it yourself,
there's no do-overs

33:20.566 --> 33:25.635
So I'd just, uh, I'd like
to have a couple of seconds.

33:25.637 --> 33:27.471
Okay.

33:35.113 --> 33:36.246
Okay.

33:36.248 --> 33:38.648
Moment of truth.

33:38.650 --> 33:40.717
(alex)
removing the clamps.

33:50.695 --> 33:55.132
(monitor beeping steadily)

33:59.570 --> 34:03.340
(inhales and exhales deeply)

34:03.342 --> 34:05.675
They look good,
dr. Reid.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.511
They're looking
really good.

34:07.513 --> 34:09.312
All right, I'll close up
from here.

34:09.314 --> 34:11.515
Thanks.

34:11.517 --> 34:13.717
All right.

34:24.095 --> 34:25.796
(rocca) suture.

34:25.798 --> 34:28.765
My shoulder blade
disconnected from my rib cage?

34:28.767 --> 34:30.667
I didn't even know
they were attached.

34:30.669 --> 34:33.270
You tore the ligament
that connects the two.

34:33.272 --> 34:34.738
And that's why
I sound like this?

34:34.740 --> 34:37.107
Well, the injury causes
some severe swelling,

34:37.109 --> 34:38.508
Which put pressure
on your vocal cords.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.377
Can you fix it?

34:40.379 --> 34:44.247
'cause I <i>love</i> kathleen turner
as much as the next guy, but...

34:44.249 --> 34:46.183
Yeah, we booked you
for surgery on Wednesday,

34:46.185 --> 34:48.385
At which stage we're gonna
make a-an incision

34:48.387 --> 34:49.653
Over your chest
and we're gonna pull

34:49.655 --> 34:51.121
That clavicle back
into place.

34:51.123 --> 34:52.756
Yep, and then I'm going
to harvest a tendon

34:52.758 --> 34:54.424
From your forearm,
and dr. Goran is going

34:54.426 --> 34:55.859
To use it to attach
your clavicle

34:55.861 --> 34:57.194
Back to the breastbone.

34:57.196 --> 34:58.829
How long will I be
laid up?

34:58.831 --> 35:03.133
Uh, five or six months,
approximately.

35:03.135 --> 35:05.268
I mean, yeah, it's a long
rehabilitation process.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.504
Guys, we're selling
the house.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.339
I-I won't have a place
to live in a week.

35:09.341 --> 35:11.408
And you're gonna need
some help with daily activities

35:11.410 --> 35:13.410
Like showering, dressing,
the whole deal.

35:13.412 --> 35:16.746
I'll do it.

35:16.748 --> 35:19.716
No. You won't.

35:20.885 --> 35:22.419
I cancelled
the open house.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.621
What? Bridgette, why?

35:24.623 --> 35:26.656
Because louie,
you're a mess.

35:26.658 --> 35:28.258
I just watched
your shin bone

35:28.260 --> 35:29.726
Pop out of your leg
this morning.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.561
And believe me, that's gonna
give me nightmares

35:31.563 --> 35:33.163
For a long time.

35:33.165 --> 35:35.332
Good.
Louie.

35:37.602 --> 35:40.504
I'm sorry.

35:40.506 --> 35:41.805
Me, too.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.573
And I wanna help you.

35:43.575 --> 35:47.544
You need a place to recover,
and we still have the house.

35:47.546 --> 35:49.646
I'm gonna kill you,

35:49.648 --> 35:53.650
Well, we can always set you
up with a personal support work

35:53.652 --> 35:55.285
If you'd rather do that.
That's--that's--

35:55.287 --> 35:57.521
No, I wanna do it.
I'm gonna do it.

35:57.523 --> 36:00.390
Just till you're back
on your feet.

36:00.392 --> 36:03.894
(sighs) louie,
you need a friend right now.

36:03.896 --> 36:06.630
And I was really good
at being your friend.

36:08.900 --> 36:11.701
Why don't we let you two
figure out the details.

36:11.703 --> 36:14.237
Let's do that. Okay.

36:24.615 --> 36:26.750
(inhales deeply)

36:44.936 --> 36:49.539
<i>(voices echoing indistinctly)</i>

36:49.541 --> 36:52.542
<i>(violet)</i>
<i>charlie, can you hear me?</i>

36:52.544 --> 36:53.810
<i>Charlie?</i>

37:01.786 --> 37:04.221
Whoo. (sighs)

37:04.223 --> 37:06.523
Well, you were really
in the zone there, dr. Reid.

37:06.525 --> 37:09.859
I learned from the best.

37:09.861 --> 37:12.729
Are you happy here
at hope zion?

37:12.731 --> 37:14.364
Define happy.

37:14.366 --> 37:16.833
Well, if you ever want to
transfer to memorial,

37:16.835 --> 37:17.934
I can give you a hand.

37:17.936 --> 37:19.936
Oh, that would only
leave you with one.

37:19.938 --> 37:21.905
Ha ha!
(chuckles)

37:21.907 --> 37:25.008
I've got a million of 'em,
and none of them are good.
(clicks pen

37:25.010 --> 37:27.877
It was an honor sharing
the o.R. With you today.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.713
The feeling's very mutual.

37:30.881 --> 37:32.849
Mr. Motorcycle.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.384
Reckless, yes.

37:34.386 --> 37:35.652
No, no, no, "reckless"
was the wrong word.

37:35.654 --> 37:38.955
"audacious" is the word
I meant.
(alex) mm.

37:38.957 --> 37:40.023
And very cool.

37:40.025 --> 37:42.926
Good work.

37:42.928 --> 37:46.396
And, alex...
Yes?

37:46.398 --> 37:48.531
That worried look,
it's gone.

37:48.533 --> 37:49.933
Shut up.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.769
Gotta go. Good work.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.771
Thank you.

37:57.675 --> 38:01.011
(taps pen)
you, uh,
you two were a thing

38:01.013 --> 38:02.445
When he was your adviser?

38:02.447 --> 38:05.282
No, he was my breakup buddy
when I left joel.

38:05.284 --> 38:08.418
Pfft. Wish the leading
thoracic surgeon in the country

38:08.420 --> 38:09.786
Was <i>my</i> breakup buddy.

38:11.989 --> 38:13.790
Hey.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.425
You'd have to have
a girlfriend first.

38:15.427 --> 38:18.295
Ooh!

38:24.702 --> 38:25.902
(blows air)

38:30.308 --> 38:33.343
Charlie?

38:33.345 --> 38:35.779
Where's violet?

38:35.781 --> 38:38.481
Your coma patient?
She's in her room.

38:38.483 --> 38:39.783
Where else would she be?

38:39.785 --> 38:42.519
That's not what I meant,
dawn.

38:42.521 --> 38:44.854
(grunts and sighs deeply)

38:48.826 --> 38:51.394
You look like hell.

38:51.396 --> 38:54.764
Yeah, that's because I,
um, I just woke up

38:54.766 --> 38:56.366
From this bad dream
where you were

38:56.368 --> 38:57.434
Trying to get me fired.

38:57.436 --> 39:00.437
I'm trying to protect you.

39:00.439 --> 39:03.039
Yeah, this is the part
where you also tell me

39:03.041 --> 39:05.709
That no one knows me
like you do, right?

39:05.711 --> 39:09.579
Well, it's true,
isn't it?

39:09.581 --> 39:11.581
I've been digging through
your case files

39:11.583 --> 39:13.717
Because I'm concerned
about you.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.585
But don't worry,
you're safe.

39:15.587 --> 39:17.487
What do you mean?

39:17.489 --> 39:19.689
I've gone through every one
of your files

39:19.691 --> 39:21.424
For the last eight months,
and you have

39:21.426 --> 39:23.593
The lowest mortality rate
in the hospital.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.428
You're the best doctor
I have.

39:37.441 --> 39:40.076
(beeping)

39:41.979 --> 39:44.681
I'm still here.

39:44.683 --> 39:47.984
For at least
the next 30 years, I'd say.

39:51.088 --> 39:52.589
How are you for pain?

39:52.591 --> 39:56.159
I feel...

39:56.161 --> 39:58.061
Good.

40:02.166 --> 40:04.100
Sounds great.

40:04.102 --> 40:06.503
So tell me,

40:06.505 --> 40:08.037
What is the first thing
you're gonna do

40:08.039 --> 40:09.672
When you get
out of here?

40:09.674 --> 40:11.441
I have no idea.

40:11.443 --> 40:13.977
I'm so used to just trying
to get through the day.

40:13.979 --> 40:16.579
(knock on door)

40:16.581 --> 40:18.748
Hey.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.117
You can come
a little closer.

40:25.856 --> 40:27.424
Can I give him
a fist bump?

40:29.727 --> 40:31.694
How about we do a relay?

40:33.597 --> 40:34.764
Pow.

40:40.971 --> 40:43.907
Thank you.

40:55.486 --> 40:57.787
Talk to me about
electroconvulsive therapy.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.457
E.C.T is an extreme measure
for treating

41:00.459 --> 41:01.858
Psychiatric disorder.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.593
You're not there,
charlie.

41:03.595 --> 41:05.762
Not even close.
No, no, no, I mean,
medically speaking,

41:05.764 --> 41:07.464
How does it work?

41:07.466 --> 41:10.200
Brief electrical charge
stimulates the brain.

41:10.202 --> 41:11.768
Like a seizure would.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.470
Exactly like a seizure,
yeah.

41:13.472 --> 41:16.706
And could that stop you
from seeing things?

41:16.708 --> 41:17.740
It could.

41:17.742 --> 41:19.242
Huh.

41:19.244 --> 41:21.611
Charlie?

41:21.613 --> 41:23.913
You okay?

41:23.915 --> 41:29.552
I don't know.

41:29.554 --> 41:31.988
You look a little pale.
How are you feeling?

41:31.990 --> 41:36.259
(daughter's "still" playing)

41:36.261 --> 41:37.560
Better.

41:37.562 --> 41:40.096
â™ª and leave them

41:40.098 --> 41:42.165
I feel better.

41:42.167 --> 41:47.136
â™ª out on the road

41:47.138 --> 41:49.138
â™ª two feet standing

41:49.140 --> 41:51.941
That's yesterday's paper.

41:51.943 --> 41:53.042
Really?

41:53.044 --> 41:58.114
Oh, yeah.
Thought it looked familiar.

41:58.116 --> 42:01.017
So...

42:01.019 --> 42:04.621
I hear connor's doing
very well.

42:04.623 --> 42:06.756
He is.

42:06.758 --> 42:10.126
Awesome.
You ready to go?

42:10.128 --> 42:11.160
Joel?

42:11.162 --> 42:12.829
Mm-hmm?

42:12.831 --> 42:14.197
Can we talk?

42:14.199 --> 42:16.866
Yes.

42:16.868 --> 42:18.968
So this thing that's
going on between us,

42:18.970 --> 42:20.803
The hanging out thing.

42:20.805 --> 42:23.139
It feels a lot
like it did last time,

42:23.141 --> 42:24.841
Right before we got
together.

42:24.843 --> 42:29.879
Yeah, when I...
Screwed everything up. Mm.

42:29.881 --> 42:32.549
Yeah, I'm not gonna
do that again.

42:33.751 --> 42:36.119
So, what is this?
We're just friends?

42:36.121 --> 42:37.554
â™ª still with hearts beating

42:37.556 --> 42:39.255
â™ª still with feet touching

42:39.257 --> 42:41.157
â™ª still with eyes meeting

42:41.159 --> 42:42.325
Um, no.

42:42.327 --> 42:44.160
â™ª still our hands match

42:44.162 --> 42:46.896
â™ª still with hearts beating

42:46.898 --> 42:49.966
â™ª

42:54.004 --> 42:58.074
â™ª two feet standing
on a principle â™ª

42:58.076 --> 43:02.278
â™ª two hands digging
in each others' wounds â™ª

43:02.280 --> 43:07.116
â™ª cold smoke seeping
out of colder throats â™ª

43:07.118 --> 43:10.987
â™ª darkness falling,
leaves nowhere to go â™ª
