01:44.980 --> 01:46.732
<i>Two, right?
Please sit inside.</i>

01:46.857 --> 01:48.192
<i>Hey, please sit inside.</i>

01:48.317 --> 01:50.152
Hey, there are customers!

01:50.236 --> 01:52.279
Hey, please sit anywhere, yeah.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.593
Husband, something's not right.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.262
There are no customers.

02:16.303 --> 02:20.266
There's no reason to balance the accounts,
no reason to cook noodles.

02:20.850 --> 02:23.936
It's such a small restaurant,
why do they need so many waiters?

02:30.734 --> 02:32.027
<i>White-Fronted Tiger!</i>

02:32.486 --> 02:34.112
You're responsible for 17 major cases.

02:34.113 --> 02:37.324
Even if you run to Guangzhou,
we'll bring you to justice.

03:00.890 --> 03:05.810
Henan, Hebei, Zhejiang,
Shanxi, Jiangsu, Hubei.

03:05.811 --> 03:09.190
Constables from the six provinces
join forces to arrest a husband and wife.

03:09.273 --> 03:12.234
Even if we wanted to resist,
we'd have no chance!

03:12.693 --> 03:13.986
Come on!
Catch me!

03:14.320 --> 03:15.487
Look out!

03:33.005 --> 03:35.466
Want to arrest us?
It's not that easy!

03:54.610 --> 03:56.320
Husband!

04:01.825 --> 04:03.118
Husband...

04:04.370 --> 04:06.580
R-r-run.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.254
Boss Wong...

04:55.462 --> 04:56.588
What is it?

04:56.630 --> 04:58.424
I'm here to collect the laundry money.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.094
Come in and get it.

05:24.408 --> 05:25.951
I scared him off!

05:25.993 --> 05:28.412
That kid truly is gutless!

05:34.585 --> 05:37.004
Lucky I wasn't bitten by that mad dog!

05:38.505 --> 05:40.132
"Big Talker".

05:41.467 --> 05:42.593
Big Talker.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.720
Brother Kwan, what's your instruction?

05:45.137 --> 05:46.889
Ask Ah Sing
to help me change clothes.

05:53.854 --> 05:54.980
Big Talker.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.234
Just reading the script now?
What were you doing last night?

06:00.527 --> 06:01.695
I said get to work!

06:01.820 --> 06:02.905
Hurry up!

06:03.822 --> 06:05.783
Are you ignoring me?
Get the troupe out there now!

06:05.824 --> 06:07.284
Hurry up...

06:07.493 --> 06:08.702
Big Talker.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.207
Don't...

06:17.294 --> 06:18.837
Chasing up laundry money again?

06:29.431 --> 06:30.599
Stop right there!

06:30.641 --> 06:32.518
No need to pay now.
Take your time.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.937
I won't take it...

06:35.479 --> 06:37.689
Take my wife's undergarments
and wash them!

06:37.731 --> 06:39.441
Then...

06:40.484 --> 06:41.735
Washing or not?

06:41.777 --> 06:43.987
Washing...

06:44.321 --> 06:45.739
My big sister will scold me.

06:45.781 --> 06:47.408
And I'm throwing you out!

06:48.283 --> 06:49.368
Don't!

06:49.451 --> 06:51.620
Help me...

06:52.538 --> 06:53.414
BACKSTAGE: NO ACCESS PERMITTED

09:16.139 --> 09:19.810
Wong Fei-Hung, let's see how long
your lion king can be majestic.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.478
<i>Master Tam!</i>

09:23.021 --> 09:25.691
Master Tam,
there's a northerner wants to see you.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.318
A northerner?

09:29.803 --> 09:30.696
LION'S ROAR HALL

09:30.697 --> 09:33.740
My Lion's Roar Hall
is somewhat famous in Guangzhou,

09:33.865 --> 09:35.993
and you're a wanted criminal.

09:36.118 --> 09:39.580
Although we've been together
through thick and thin,

09:39.746 --> 09:41.540
if the authorities found out...

09:45.085 --> 09:49.089
White-Fronted Tiger,
you mustn't cause any more trouble.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.220
Seeing we're as good as brothers...

09:55.804 --> 09:57.347
Spend this money.

10:01.018 --> 10:05.522
Look, I have a few apprentices
who work in the theatre troupe.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.442
Hide among the troupe for the time being.

10:08.567 --> 10:09.985
Lay low till the fuss dies down.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.237
Take it one step at a time.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.793
I'm telling you,
stop dragging your feet.

10:26.835 --> 10:29.004
The money belongs to me, Mok Geung.
No more delays!

10:29.212 --> 10:31.715
Don't believe me?
I'll break your bones!

10:32.090 --> 10:33.258
Looking?
What're you looking at?

10:33.342 --> 10:36.428
You don't know me, Mok Geung?
Then you're not up to scratch!

10:36.970 --> 10:39.514
Look at you,
dirty and of low character.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.475
Meet a good guy and you're all talk.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.477
Meet a bad guy and you're gobsmacked!

10:43.518 --> 10:45.228
My big sister's fiercer than you!

10:45.270 --> 10:47.272
Don't pay and we'll kick your ass!

10:47.397 --> 10:49.399
Little Geung, who are you scolding?

10:51.443 --> 10:53.195
Nobody... just scolding him.

10:53.278 --> 10:54.488
And who's he?

10:55.530 --> 10:58.784
He's me and I'm him.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.245
Good-for-nothing!

11:04.623 --> 11:07.459
Oh, yeah. Where's the laundry money
you collected today?

11:07.501 --> 11:09.586
Oh, collect?
I collected some more laundry!

11:10.045 --> 11:12.005
- Here.
- How come there's so much laundry?

11:12.464 --> 11:14.757
Little Geung, your jacket looks dirty.
Take it off for washing.

11:14.758 --> 11:17.094
Oh, a dirty appearance's no problem!

11:17.344 --> 11:19.221
- Take it off!
- No need!

11:26.186 --> 11:27.396
The money?

11:28.814 --> 11:30.941
Where's the laundry money
you collected today?

11:30.982 --> 11:32.859
Ah Fook said I'd need to run a marathon
to get his money.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.611
Ah Sau cried,
claimed he was poor.

11:34.695 --> 11:37.572
Big Talker shouted rudely at me
and surely pocketed the money.

11:37.614 --> 11:38.907
So I didn't collect any.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.451
You keep "collecting" like this,
and we'll be poor, not them!

11:41.493 --> 11:43.495
- Big Sister, that Big Talker...
- Are you a coward?

11:43.620 --> 11:45.789
So useless!
How can you achieve something big?!

11:47.082 --> 11:48.207
- Big Sister, don't!
- I'll beat you to death!

11:48.208 --> 11:50.043
Don't, Big Sister!
Don't!

11:50.085 --> 11:52.295
Big Talker's just as fierce as you!

11:53.046 --> 11:54.089
Don't!

11:58.385 --> 11:59.678
Don't you run!

11:59.761 --> 12:02.764
If you can't get money from Big Talker,
don't come back for dinner!

12:09.604 --> 12:11.606
PO CHI LAM

12:46.767 --> 12:48.310
Who's Wong Fei-Hung?

12:53.482 --> 12:56.610
- May I ask...?
- Navy's chief coach, Iron Five-Fingers.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.238
- What is it?
- Are you blind?

13:00.739 --> 13:01.990
Wait a moment.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.242
No way!

13:06.995 --> 13:08.038
Please.

13:09.581 --> 13:10.707
Sit.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.754
I'll treat you.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.760
I can't stand pain!
Pain drives me crazy!

13:22.761 --> 13:24.221
When crazy I hit people!

13:24.721 --> 13:27.766
Oh? Ha!
Talk about fighting spirit.

13:27.808 --> 13:28.975
No need for my master to come.

13:29.059 --> 13:30.060
<i>Foon!</i>

13:31.394 --> 13:32.437
Master.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.147
How can you treat a patient like this?

13:35.232 --> 13:37.692
No, I was cleaning the stool
for you to sit on.

13:37.818 --> 13:38.985
Master, sit down.

13:41.655 --> 13:42.823
Old friend...

13:44.574 --> 13:47.160
- Where does it hurt?
- My whole body hurts!

13:47.536 --> 13:49.913
Allow me, Wong Fei-Hung,
to examine you, alright?

13:50.539 --> 13:53.083
Fine!
Wong Fei-Hung, I can't stand pain.

13:53.208 --> 13:54.543
I already beat several bonesetters.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.962
I crippled them.
You better watch out!

14:07.764 --> 14:12.394
So... blood gas is blocked,
the pulse's weak.

14:12.894 --> 14:15.689
Master Wong, can it be treated?

14:16.022 --> 14:18.483
Master Wong can treat you,
of course.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.576
Smooth and unobstructed.

14:28.285 --> 14:30.620
Master Wong's brilliant,
sure enough.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.457
Is something wrong?

14:35.166 --> 14:37.878
My friend,
it's not only a dislocation;

14:38.086 --> 14:39.421
you've also suffered an internal injury.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.798
Shit!
Are you messing with me?

14:42.299 --> 14:45.218
Oh, touch the sixth rib
on your right side.

14:45.343 --> 14:46.720
Does it still hurt?

14:54.185 --> 14:55.145
No.

14:55.186 --> 14:57.689
No?
How about right here?

14:59.941 --> 15:01.026
It really hurts.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.571
More than that... your breathing
isn't as smooth as it should be.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.287
Yes, you're right!

15:13.705 --> 15:15.582
Your martial practice is excessive.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.459
You've harmed your liver.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.003
Qi stagnates in the liver
and burns with rage.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.380
You must use
the mild and heavy respiration method.

15:22.505 --> 15:26.718
Take this to disperse the blood stasis,
and you'll recover naturally.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.679
Will it hurt?

15:31.097 --> 15:32.390
It won't hurt.

15:36.186 --> 15:37.395
Small flame.

15:41.983 --> 15:43.693
The suction's so tight.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.162
Doesn't hurt, does it?

15:56.039 --> 15:57.207
Martial flame.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.000
Martial flame, as well?

15:59.960 --> 16:01.753
Wong Fei-Hung,
you trying to murder me?!

16:02.587 --> 16:04.381
Ah, I'm on fire!

16:14.683 --> 16:15.976
Want to kill me?!

16:18.228 --> 16:19.896
It doesn't hurt!

16:35.495 --> 16:36.663
Again?!

16:51.261 --> 16:52.637
Feeling better?

16:57.851 --> 16:59.060
Truly effective!

16:59.144 --> 17:00.311
Naturally!

17:05.567 --> 17:07.152
Motherfucker!
Hit me?!

17:16.161 --> 17:18.163
How many hands did you use to fight me?

17:26.046 --> 17:27.505
You're great!
I defer to you.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.715
Please...

17:35.513 --> 17:37.557
I hate this style of jacket the most.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.017
I'm giving it to you.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.520
- Hey... don't go!
- Stop calling.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.023
- He didn't pay the consultation fee.
- Forget it.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.358
Get ready for the lion dance.

17:47.609 --> 17:48.610
Got it, Master.

17:51.821 --> 17:52.654
HENAN PROVINCIAL HALL

17:52.655 --> 17:53.948
Take this, will you?

17:54.074 --> 17:55.617
Firecrackers.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.732
Dear fellow villagers and elders.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.859
Today's the inauguration
of the Henan Provincial Hall.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.736
We're especially pleased to welcome,
from Po Chi Lam

18:31.861 --> 18:34.489
the one they call the Lion King,
Master Wong Fei-Hung,

18:34.614 --> 18:36.741
who, with his disciple,
Leung Foon,

18:37.117 --> 18:39.244
will perform for us
a celebratory lion dance.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.620
Thank you...

18:43.748 --> 18:47.043
Master,
I've never seen this kind of green.

18:47.210 --> 18:49.962
Is it easy to p-p-pick?

18:49.963 --> 18:53.383
Easy to pick?
Losing balance results in death!

18:53.424 --> 18:56.261
S-s-so what's the name of t-t-this green?

18:57.303 --> 18:59.013
Gold and Silver Green.

18:59.931 --> 19:02.892
First, you have to cross
the Gold and Silver Bridge,

19:03.017 --> 19:06.521
in order to pick the auspicious green
at the bridgehead.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.899
- Foon! Raise the lion!
- Yes!

19:10.108 --> 19:11.317
Start the drum!

20:04.245 --> 20:05.997
- Seven, go up!
- OK!

20:30.271 --> 20:32.106
Hey, are you messing with me?
Hurry up and cross!

20:32.190 --> 20:33.399
Hold on!

21:10.103 --> 21:11.312
Get up!

21:22.240 --> 21:23.366
Jump!

21:29.038 --> 21:30.540
Why are you so clumsy?

21:30.999 --> 21:32.709
Stop nagging!
Build a bridge.

22:12.415 --> 22:13.666
I can't hold it!

22:17.587 --> 22:18.838
Seven, your belt.

22:22.717 --> 22:25.511
<i>Terrific...</i>

22:33.311 --> 22:35.605
Master,
t-t-they can't reach it!

22:35.730 --> 22:36.814
Keep quiet!

22:36.898 --> 22:39.192
Use the meridian staff!

23:34.372 --> 23:36.374
Master, it's Lion's Roar Hall!

24:10.408 --> 24:11.909
Seven Star Iron Rings!

24:34.557 --> 24:36.309
- Foon, the lion's tail!
- Yes!

24:37.768 --> 24:39.604
Be careful!
Wong Fei-Hung's entered the fray.

24:51.365 --> 24:52.700
Seven Star Iron Rings?!

26:11.320 --> 26:12.655
Foon, be careful!

26:20.663 --> 26:22.164
Get ready to shoulder!

27:36.072 --> 27:37.990
Master...

27:38.866 --> 27:40.618
Wong Fei-Hung,
you're really something!

27:40.701 --> 27:41.869
Let's go!

28:10.690 --> 28:13.693
MAY YOUR WISHES COME TRUE

28:34.839 --> 28:36.716
Thank you... everyone.

28:37.258 --> 28:38.300
Thanks.

28:40.970 --> 28:42.263
Excuse me...

28:43.305 --> 28:44.473
Little Geung.

28:47.476 --> 28:50.020
You look miserable.
What's the matter?

28:53.190 --> 28:55.317
Couldn't collect the laundry money?

28:58.028 --> 29:00.489
You're so timid,
who doesn't bully you?

29:00.531 --> 29:02.783
Here, we two are sworn brothers.

29:02.867 --> 29:04.869
I'll help you collect the debts.

29:05.536 --> 29:07.955
But you have to smile, eh...?

29:21.469 --> 29:23.386
Let's go backstage,
take a picture with Godbrother Kwan.

29:23.387 --> 29:24.430
OK.

29:26.557 --> 29:27.767
Brother Kwan.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.186
Some tea.

29:31.145 --> 29:32.521
<i>Godbrother Kwan!</i>

29:33.439 --> 29:34.940
Hey, Godsister!

29:36.275 --> 29:38.569
- Ah Kwan.
- Did I do a good job just then?

29:38.611 --> 29:40.321
My goodness!
You couldn't have been better,

29:40.362 --> 29:41.654
- Godbrother.
- Really?

29:41.655 --> 29:43.324
- Let's take a picture together, OK?
- OK!

29:43.407 --> 29:46.619
- Ah Fok, take a picture for us.
<i>- Oh, alright!</i>

29:47.036 --> 29:50.330
Now, Godbrother,
I want a pretty picture.

29:50.331 --> 29:53.708
Sure, he's a good photographer.

29:53.709 --> 29:55.503
<i>Get ready!
Hurry up!</i>

30:20.820 --> 30:22.571
Closer, look at me.

30:22.655 --> 30:25.282
Don't move.
Pose, smile.

30:25.407 --> 30:26.700
Now pose.

30:26.867 --> 30:27.952
Ready!

30:34.416 --> 30:35.668
You bastard!

30:53.102 --> 30:54.603
You must be tired of living!

30:54.770 --> 30:56.230
How dare you offend Brother Kwan!

30:56.564 --> 31:01.235
If I weren't giving Master Tam face,
I'd have broken your hands already.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.863
Get lost!
Now!

31:08.993 --> 31:11.495
<i>Auntie, get me a cup of tea.</i>

31:28.387 --> 31:29.763
Husband...

31:32.182 --> 31:33.517
R-r-run.

31:50.743 --> 31:52.828
<i>Sister Bing, let's go out tonight</i>

31:53.037 --> 31:54.412
- and have supper.
- For real?

31:54.413 --> 31:57.458
- It's definitely for real.
- I don't believe it!

31:57.541 --> 32:00.544
- Big... Big Talker!
- You're always teasing me.

32:03.380 --> 32:04.590
No.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.342
This.

32:08.385 --> 32:11.513
"Big Talker."

32:11.847 --> 32:13.390
"Talker."

32:15.809 --> 32:16.977
Sister Bing!

32:17.311 --> 32:21.106
The two words under "Big Talker",
what are they?

32:24.693 --> 32:28.155
- Does it praise me?
- Yeah, if you're a "Turtle egg!" (bastard)

32:30.282 --> 32:32.743
Damn kid, making fun of me?!

32:33.535 --> 32:34.662
Help!

32:35.496 --> 32:38.207
Don't run...

32:39.416 --> 32:41.043
Brother Foon, that's him.

32:49.218 --> 32:50.636
Little Geung, have fun.

32:50.844 --> 32:52.930
No, I can't do it.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.307
My legs go weak whenever I see him.

33:08.362 --> 33:10.614
Wow!
Brother Foon's so strong!

33:10.739 --> 33:13.367
If only I were half as good as him.

34:01.790 --> 34:02.833
Does it hurt...?

34:02.916 --> 34:04.293
Men I beat mustn't cry out.

34:08.422 --> 34:10.382
And smile!

34:16.889 --> 34:19.725
Smile without your mouth showing contempt.

34:22.102 --> 34:23.479
Little Geung.

34:30.611 --> 34:31.612
Hey!

34:32.112 --> 34:34.281
In future,
whenever you see Brother Geung

34:34.323 --> 34:35.824
you better smile!

34:37.326 --> 34:39.787
- Brother Geung.
- Hey... what are you forgetting?

34:44.208 --> 34:45.209
Go!

34:48.420 --> 34:50.089
Brother Foon, you're great!

34:51.465 --> 34:53.675
When encountering his sort,
you must be more fierce.

34:53.717 --> 34:57.262
Right, but I'm not sure
I could ever be that fierce.

34:57.513 --> 34:59.932
Brother Foon,
I really envy your might.

35:00.140 --> 35:03.185
If only Master Wong were willing
to accept me as an apprentice.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.562
OK, I'll ask my master for you.

35:05.646 --> 35:08.232
Now, if there's nothing else,
I'll leave first.

35:19.159 --> 35:20.536
Ah, what're you doing?

36:23.265 --> 36:24.683
Old friend, excuse me.

36:27.019 --> 36:29.188
All made up like a demon!
What a phoney!

36:29.271 --> 36:30.856
Get lost...

37:10.479 --> 37:12.189
Help me...

37:12.231 --> 37:14.066
Painted Face's trying to kill me!

37:16.026 --> 37:19.321
<i>Give way...</i>
Please, give way!

37:19.446 --> 37:20.864
Don't blame me if there's an accident!

37:20.948 --> 37:22.449
Please, give way...

37:22.991 --> 37:24.868
Give way...
Thanks...

39:52.599 --> 39:53.767
Big Brother, help me!

39:53.809 --> 39:55.435
Someone's trying to kill me!

39:55.811 --> 39:57.729
Big Brother,
someone's trying to kill me!

39:58.146 --> 40:00.857
Can't you hear me...?

40:01.108 --> 40:03.360
What rotten luck!
Running into a deaf man!

40:50.282 --> 40:53.694
<i>- Now, you must answer my questions honestly.
- OK.</i>

40:53.695 --> 40:55.119
- Do you recognise the deceased?
- I don't know him.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.163
- Yes!
- Did you know the deceased?

40:56.204 --> 40:57.288
- I didn't know him.
- What did he do here?

40:57.289 --> 40:58.889
<i>- He dressed the actors.</i>
- What hobbies did the deceased have?

40:58.890 --> 41:00.040
- I don't know.
- Say that again.

41:00.041 --> 41:01.168
I don't know.

41:01.710 --> 41:02.711
Reporting!

41:02.752 --> 41:04.754
The Chief Constable of the Seven Provinces
has arrived.

41:05.046 --> 41:06.465
In formation!

41:08.467 --> 41:09.759
Attention!

41:14.723 --> 41:16.266
Reporting to the Chief Constable!

41:19.644 --> 41:21.646
Reporting.
Inside, please...

41:22.063 --> 41:23.482
Chief Constable.

41:24.024 --> 41:25.817
I say, go inside.

41:26.234 --> 41:27.277
My God!

41:27.611 --> 41:29.821
With the Chief Constable's reputation
and my standing,

41:29.863 --> 41:31.072
you dare barge through?

41:31.114 --> 41:32.741
Men, lock him up!

41:32.782 --> 41:34.326
Is that right, Chief Constable?

41:34.367 --> 41:35.619
Useless!

41:36.077 --> 41:37.370
Chief Constable.

41:39.080 --> 41:40.207
You?

41:40.624 --> 41:42.334
It's really you?

41:43.335 --> 41:44.503
Reporting!

42:04.397 --> 42:05.982
The golden spear hasn't fallen.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.692
Murdered in a crime of passion.

42:19.829 --> 42:21.498
What I meant to say was...

42:21.540 --> 42:25.544
He must've been killed by a love rival
in a dispute over a woman.

42:26.920 --> 42:29.339
Hmm... that makes sense!

42:29.839 --> 42:31.383
The method was so vicious.

42:31.633 --> 42:34.970
Chief,
could White-Fronted Tiger have done it?

42:37.222 --> 42:40.475
From my careful observations,
it's...

42:40.517 --> 42:41.768
Unlikely, right?

42:42.143 --> 42:44.104
- Likely!
- Likely...

42:44.187 --> 42:47.440
Plus,
from my shrewd analysis, it's...

42:47.482 --> 42:48.733
Likely, right?

42:49.693 --> 42:50.860
Unlikely!

42:53.905 --> 42:55.865
Wise opinion, Chief...

42:56.116 --> 42:59.869
I came from the North to Guangzhou
to hunt White-Fronted Tiger.

42:59.953 --> 43:02.372
A minor case like this is yours to settle.

43:02.414 --> 43:03.331
Yes...

43:03.415 --> 43:07.669
If you can't solve this case,
take care you're not demoted!

43:10.839 --> 43:12.215
Demoted?

43:12.382 --> 43:14.342
Chief...

43:16.219 --> 43:18.221
Chief,
you've come far from the North.

43:18.263 --> 43:20.390
Tomorrow,
let me welcome you to dinner.

43:21.516 --> 43:24.519
Please...

43:26.396 --> 43:30.566
Master Tam, the Drunk Moon House opened,
but didn't invite us to do a lion dance.

43:30.567 --> 43:31.776
How come?

43:32.235 --> 43:34.112
<i>They invited Wong Fei-Hung.</i>

43:38.158 --> 43:40.160
Wong Fei-Hung, again?

43:41.453 --> 43:43.580
In a few days it's his birthday.

43:44.706 --> 43:48.627
Junior, gift a sau yi (birthday suit)
from me to Wong Fei-Hung.

43:50.545 --> 43:53.590
<i>I'll produce a sau yi (burial suit)
to Wong Fei-Hung's satisfaction.</i>

44:01.014 --> 44:04.392
Ah Foon,
it's my birthday in a few days.

44:04.809 --> 44:06.227
Is everything ready?

44:06.311 --> 44:07.312
Everything's ready, Master.

44:07.395 --> 44:08.897
- Good.
<i>- M-m-master!</i>

44:09.814 --> 44:14.443
M-m-master, o-o-outside there's
a t-t-tailor, says he's...

44:14.444 --> 44:17.405
- m-m-making you a burial suit...
- What?!

44:17.614 --> 44:23.203
No... h-h-he said, m-m-making
a n-n-new suit for your b-b-birthday.

44:23.912 --> 44:25.205
Invite him in.

44:28.500 --> 44:30.001
BURIAL CLOTHING EXPERT

44:35.006 --> 44:37.509
Oh, why isn't it Tailor Dou!?

44:37.550 --> 44:39.969
Oh, Ah Dou went back home.

44:40.011 --> 44:42.639
Master Wong,
let me take your measurements.

44:43.890 --> 44:44.933
Fine.

44:50.980 --> 44:54.359
Wear the garment I make,
and you'll look very handsome.

44:56.152 --> 44:58.947
Then,
why don't you make one for yourself?

45:00.615 --> 45:02.157
Chest, twenty-four.
Most impressive.

45:02.158 --> 45:03.368
A compliment.

45:04.411 --> 45:05.912
Arm, three feet long.

45:06.663 --> 45:07.831
Formal cuff or martial cuff?

45:07.914 --> 45:09.290
Formal cuff.

45:09.582 --> 45:11.209
Cuff width, six inches.

45:13.420 --> 45:14.796
Slit width, two feet.

45:15.505 --> 45:16.923
Height, five feet.

45:18.717 --> 45:20.135
Shoulder width, one foot-eight.

45:21.386 --> 45:22.887
Waist, thirty.

45:25.974 --> 45:29.394
Oh, you have to use a needle
to take my measurements?

45:29.686 --> 45:31.896
There's a loose button,
I'll sew it on for you.

45:31.938 --> 45:33.481
Oh, thank you.

45:33.815 --> 45:34.941
No need.

45:37.068 --> 45:38.486
Let me measure your neck.

45:38.987 --> 45:40.655
Collar height, two inches.

45:47.746 --> 45:48.872
Have you finished measuring?

45:48.913 --> 45:51.207
If you stop moving,
I'd have measured it already.

46:13.062 --> 46:15.607
Finished measuring?
What else do you have to do?

46:17.275 --> 46:18.485
Choose the material.

46:21.613 --> 46:23.072
I'll take the one in your hand.

46:26.201 --> 46:27.410
Cut the material.

47:07.367 --> 47:10.870
Deadly tailor,
I know you have bad intentions.

47:10.995 --> 47:12.914
I have no grievance with you.

47:13.039 --> 47:14.916
Why do you wish to take my life?

47:15.834 --> 47:18.336
My senior, Tam Hing dislikes you.

47:18.461 --> 47:21.714
Better to quash enmity than keep it alive.

47:21.798 --> 47:24.133
Please pass on a message to Master Tam:

47:24.843 --> 47:27.136
I very much want to be
good friends with him.

47:27.470 --> 47:29.639
- Ah Foon.
- Yes, Master.

47:31.307 --> 47:33.393
- Give him back his scissors.
- Got it.

47:45.905 --> 47:47.240
Not yet clean.

47:47.782 --> 47:50.910
Scrub...
Make me rich...

47:50.994 --> 47:52.704
Scrub...
Make me...

47:55.832 --> 47:57.417
Another one broken.

48:11.639 --> 48:13.266
Ah, help!

48:15.810 --> 48:17.896
Damn you, Little Geung!
Making a fuss about nothing!

48:18.855 --> 48:20.315
Elder Sister, it's only you!

48:20.356 --> 48:22.400
I thought it was Painted Face!

48:23.735 --> 48:25.987
No need to be afraid...

48:26.112 --> 48:29.157
Don't be such a coward!
Why're you so afraid of this Painted Face?

48:29.198 --> 48:30.283
You really scared me!

48:30.325 --> 48:32.911
- No need to be afraid.
- Why did you stop washing?!

48:33.119 --> 48:34.579
No need to shout.

48:41.127 --> 48:43.504
I told you before,
wring using only two fingers.

48:45.131 --> 48:48.301
Why would I do it like that?
It's strenuous and troublesome.

48:48.509 --> 48:50.136
It's the kung fu Grandpa passed down.

48:50.178 --> 48:51.638
Use finger strength to wring.

48:51.888 --> 48:54.390
It can't be used to fight.

50:13.678 --> 50:15.430
Hey,
who dropped money on the ground?

50:15.471 --> 50:18.266
Huh? Money?
I dropped it...

50:18.516 --> 50:20.018
Yeah, I dropped it.

50:24.981 --> 50:26.357
Which bastard dared do that!?

50:28.026 --> 50:30.862
You dare dirty my laundry?!
I'll beat you to death!

50:31.195 --> 50:33.281
It wasn't me!
It's nothing to do with me!

50:33.364 --> 50:35.616
- It wasn't me...
- You liar!

50:35.700 --> 50:38.661
<i>- It's nothing to do with me...
- Think you can run away...?</i>

50:39.579 --> 50:42.040
- Brother Foon.
- Now, as we're sworn brothers,

50:42.081 --> 50:44.625
I'll take you to practice courage.

50:44.667 --> 50:46.002
How d'you practice that?

50:47.086 --> 50:48.171
Isn't that...?

50:48.796 --> 50:49.922
Don't make it sound so bad.

50:49.964 --> 50:51.549
It'll teach you how to be a man.

50:51.591 --> 50:52.884
How to be a man?

50:52.967 --> 50:54.302
Yeah, let's go.

50:54.761 --> 50:56.763
ELEGANT EMERALD HOUSE

50:57.472 --> 51:00.516
Chief Bau, please...

51:01.976 --> 51:02.935
What is this place?

51:02.977 --> 51:05.855
Oh, this is the most advanced brothel
in Guangzhou.

51:05.938 --> 51:07.982
- Brothel?
- Yes.

51:09.317 --> 51:12.737
Who do you think I am?
Bringing me to a place like this!

51:13.613 --> 51:15.490
Indeed,
public morals degenerate by the day.

51:15.531 --> 51:18.826
"Virtue decays,
but the human heart is immortal..."

51:19.744 --> 51:20.828
Wow!

51:24.665 --> 51:26.959
What a great ass!

51:29.712 --> 51:31.130
My goodness, Brother Foon!

51:31.172 --> 51:32.756
What brings you here?

51:32.757 --> 51:35.051
- I've been thinking about you.
- That so?

51:35.093 --> 51:38.012
Chief Bau...

51:38.387 --> 51:40.264
Why don't we go someplace else?

51:40.306 --> 51:42.433
Well, now that we're here,

51:42.517 --> 51:46.270
it's convenient to investigate
and see if there are any underage girls.

51:46.312 --> 51:47.480
Right!

51:48.356 --> 51:50.942
- Drink up! Don't be shy.
- Oh... drink?

51:50.983 --> 51:53.069
Drink...

51:53.277 --> 51:55.780
- Oh, right. Drink.
- Drink up!

51:56.531 --> 51:58.074
Mok Geung, don't be so tense.

51:58.157 --> 51:59.534
You're starting to blush.

51:59.575 --> 52:02.662
I'm starting to blush because I'm
drinking this wine... Blushing?!

52:02.703 --> 52:04.497
You're drinking soy sauce!

52:08.960 --> 52:10.085
- Open up!
- Come on, drink another cup.

52:10.086 --> 52:12.213
I'm borrowing your girl for my inquiries.

52:12.630 --> 52:14.757
- What're you doing?!
- Hold it!

52:16.843 --> 52:17.969
What is it?

52:18.010 --> 52:20.138
Alright if I borrow <i>your</i> wife
for <i>my</i> personal use?

52:20.179 --> 52:22.305
- Do you know who I am?
- Do you know who <i>I</i> am?

52:22.306 --> 52:23.933
- Who <i>are</i> you?
- Po Chi Lam's Leung Foon.

52:23.975 --> 52:25.977
- Never heard of you.
- Wong Fei-Hung, heard of him?

52:26.060 --> 52:27.145
I've heard a little.

52:29.063 --> 52:30.189
This is he.

52:32.692 --> 52:35.820
Wong Fei-Hung... if I'm afraid of you,
my name isn't Bau Tang-Chun!

52:37.238 --> 52:38.364
No need to beat yourself up.

52:38.406 --> 52:39.657
I'll do it for you!

52:45.788 --> 52:48.416
Hey...
now's the time to practice courage.

52:48.541 --> 52:50.126
Stay calm, come out with me.

52:50.501 --> 52:52.795
- Lock him up for me!
- Yes!

52:58.634 --> 53:00.469
Chief, which one?

53:00.511 --> 53:02.763
Good-for-nothing!
The one behind!

53:02.805 --> 53:04.265
Yes, Chief!

53:06.184 --> 53:07.309
It's none of your business.

53:07.310 --> 53:08.728
Excuse me.

53:11.022 --> 53:12.231
You resist?!

53:14.317 --> 53:15.984
No need to be afraid of him.
We two are sworn brothers.

53:15.985 --> 53:17.111
Fight him!

53:17.320 --> 53:18.321
You bast...

53:19.155 --> 53:20.907
Sorry...

53:42.053 --> 53:44.096
Chief Bau, are you alright?

53:54.941 --> 53:56.234
Good footwork!

53:57.235 --> 53:59.110
You sneak attacked me
with your Shadowless Kick?!

53:59.111 --> 54:00.905
Give me my weapon!

54:11.874 --> 54:13.125
Let go!

54:31.936 --> 54:33.521
Remove your foot!

54:40.820 --> 54:42.822
You told me to remove my foot.

54:53.207 --> 54:55.167
This is a great punch bag.
Practice a while.

54:55.459 --> 54:58.129
- Not me.
- Come here.

55:00.464 --> 55:01.632
Practice.

55:05.219 --> 55:06.721
More power.

55:08.639 --> 55:11.017
Wong Fei-Hung, you dare hit me?!

55:11.100 --> 55:12.435
So what if he hit you?!

55:12.518 --> 55:13.561
Look!

55:17.315 --> 55:19.317
Still wanted to wield a weapon?!

55:23.946 --> 55:25.823
The Chief Constable
of the Seven Provinces' stamp?!

55:26.782 --> 55:27.867
Police?!

55:27.908 --> 55:29.702
W-w-what do we do?

55:33.039 --> 55:35.333
You rest a while.
I'll get you help.

55:35.458 --> 55:36.584
Let's go!

55:39.253 --> 55:40.880
FOOK HING HOUSE

55:45.343 --> 55:46.510
<i>Master.</i>

55:48.262 --> 55:51.015
I brought Geung,
that kid I told you about.

55:51.932 --> 55:53.434
- Where is he?
- There...

55:55.227 --> 55:58.105
Come out!
Tell Master yourself. Speak up!

55:58.481 --> 56:01.442
- Master, I...
- Speak up!

56:01.525 --> 56:03.402
I want to take you as my apprentice!

56:04.487 --> 56:06.654
No...
I want to be your master!

56:06.655 --> 56:07.990
My goodness, you're so clumsy!

56:08.032 --> 56:10.201
Master, he wants you to
accept him as an apprentice,

56:10.242 --> 56:11.994
and respect you as his master.

56:12.370 --> 56:14.789
- I idolise you.
- Oh?

56:17.708 --> 56:18.793
No?!

56:20.378 --> 56:21.587
It's hopeless!

56:41.732 --> 56:42.858
It's boiling!

56:42.900 --> 56:45.361
My God!
You stupid bastard!

56:45.403 --> 56:46.779
You trying to scald my daughter?

56:46.821 --> 56:48.739
- Madam!
- You jinx! Shut up! Let's go!

56:48.781 --> 56:52.284
- Madam!
- Little Geung... come here.

56:53.702 --> 56:56.205
Master Wong, I was wrongly accused.

56:56.414 --> 56:57.498
I was.

56:57.581 --> 56:59.583
Have you studied kung fu before?

56:59.667 --> 57:00.793
No.

57:03.546 --> 57:04.672
Approved?!

57:05.464 --> 57:07.508
- Approved!
- What's approved?

57:07.633 --> 57:10.177
It means you've been approved.
Kneel down!

57:15.975 --> 57:18.894
<i>This is my best singing bird.</i>

57:20.229 --> 57:22.314
There.

57:31.031 --> 57:32.283
You both...

57:32.408 --> 57:34.702
<i>My goodness!
Watch where you're going!</i>

57:34.785 --> 57:39.248
Oh, Little Miss!
You set free my lovebird.

57:39.457 --> 57:42.209
I'll let you be my little skylark.

57:42.751 --> 57:44.462
Give the bird back to him.

57:44.503 --> 57:47.631
<i>Little Miss,
come home with me now.</i>

57:47.756 --> 57:50.383
<i>- Let me go...
- I'll treat you well.</i>

57:50.384 --> 57:52.970
Here,
now's your chance to show Master.

57:53.095 --> 57:54.388
You have to get it done.

57:55.681 --> 57:57.558
Be bold.
Go on!

58:00.644 --> 58:02.563
- Take her back.
- Right!

58:03.189 --> 58:04.899
Hey, don't bully people.

58:04.940 --> 58:06.442
The bird's here!

58:08.986 --> 58:10.196
<i>I'm not going back!</i>

58:10.321 --> 58:11.489
My God!

58:17.161 --> 58:18.496
Wong Fei-Hung?!

58:19.330 --> 58:20.456
Still here?

58:20.539 --> 58:21.749
Master Wong, I'm sorry!

58:21.790 --> 58:24.502
It's my fault.
Sorry! Let's go...

58:24.585 --> 58:26.754
It's Wong Fei-Hung!
Run!

58:30.883 --> 58:32.009
Are you alright?

58:32.051 --> 58:33.219
I'm fine.

58:34.345 --> 58:35.471
Thanks, Master Wong.

58:35.513 --> 58:36.889
Master Wong?

58:45.564 --> 58:46.941
Strike while the iron's hot.

58:46.982 --> 58:48.734
Master, the girl dropped her purse.

58:48.817 --> 58:50.819
We'll take it to her.
Hurry up!

59:01.664 --> 59:02.665
Go on!

59:05.793 --> 59:07.169
Little Miss!

59:09.880 --> 59:11.090
Master Wong?

59:11.465 --> 59:13.342
W-w-where is he?

59:13.384 --> 59:14.718
She's calling you.

59:16.387 --> 59:17.596
Right here!

59:18.347 --> 59:20.057
That's my purse.

59:22.142 --> 59:23.435
You dropped this.

59:24.061 --> 59:25.104
Thank you.

59:25.145 --> 59:26.522
Don't mention it.

59:27.356 --> 59:29.233
Would you go out with Master Wong
this evening?

59:29.275 --> 59:33.195
I guess so... but not too late.

59:35.155 --> 59:38.367
Here, I stole Master's clothes.

59:38.492 --> 59:41.370
They'll fit you from head to toe.

1:00:04.393 --> 1:00:07.396
- Ah Foon!
- Master.

1:00:07.521 --> 1:00:10.816
My gown... it's too hot!

1:00:11.025 --> 1:00:12.693
Now's the time to get the girl.

1:00:12.860 --> 1:00:14.820
How can you not dress smartly?

1:00:14.987 --> 1:00:17.615
Hey, what if we get found out?
I'm afraid.

1:00:17.823 --> 1:00:20.034
No need to be afraid.
I'll be there.

1:00:20.659 --> 1:00:24.496
Now, with beauties,
one must be bold, but cautious...

1:00:24.955 --> 1:00:26.832
...and thick skinned!

1:00:27.249 --> 1:00:30.669
Now, I've got an idea for you:
play hero and save the beauty.

1:00:30.794 --> 1:00:31.754
Hero, how?

1:00:31.795 --> 1:00:38.093
Tonight, that Painted Face you're so
afraid of... will make an appearance!

1:01:05.245 --> 1:01:06.246
Wong...

1:01:06.413 --> 1:01:07.665
You hit me!

1:01:07.706 --> 1:01:09.708
No, I hit a mosquito.

1:01:36.235 --> 1:01:38.404
No need to be afraid...

1:01:41.573 --> 1:01:44.118
Watch... me...
teach this scum a lesson!

1:01:52.668 --> 1:01:53.669
Block!

1:02:01.468 --> 1:02:03.554
- Why don't you kick me?
- Kick you how?

1:02:03.595 --> 1:02:05.222
From below.

1:02:07.099 --> 1:02:08.976
You kicked the wrong place!

1:02:20.696 --> 1:02:22.114
Lazy!
Do it harder!

1:02:22.197 --> 1:02:23.449
Do it harder?!

1:02:28.328 --> 1:02:30.289
But that's too hard!

1:02:31.206 --> 1:02:32.374
Still here?

1:02:33.792 --> 1:02:35.878
This kid's attack is strong!

1:02:37.963 --> 1:02:40.382
This is the mightiest moment of my life.

1:02:41.592 --> 1:02:42.801
Master Wong.

1:02:46.513 --> 1:02:49.808
With you here,
I feel a sense of security.

1:02:50.601 --> 1:02:52.102
Really?

1:02:55.022 --> 1:02:56.106
I'm sorry.

1:02:56.565 --> 1:02:57.649
Are you OK?

1:02:58.317 --> 1:02:59.443
Are you alright?

1:02:59.818 --> 1:03:00.819
Hey...

1:03:05.115 --> 1:03:06.492
That Painted Face's back!

1:03:06.617 --> 1:03:07.993
I'm afraid!

1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:13.582
Get rid of him!

1:03:14.708 --> 1:03:15.751
OK!

1:03:19.713 --> 1:03:22.716
Brother Foon,
your trick of coming back really works!

1:03:22.758 --> 1:03:24.092
Never knew it could be so romantic.

1:03:24.134 --> 1:03:27.386
Now, as we're such good brothers,
let me impress her one more time.

1:03:27.387 --> 1:03:28.514
You know what to do!

1:03:30.849 --> 1:03:32.059
Check this out!

1:03:40.567 --> 1:03:42.986
- Are you alright?
- It's nothing, just a little slip.

1:03:43.612 --> 1:03:45.864
Brother Foon,
you're overdoing it!

1:03:46.156 --> 1:03:48.158
Huh?!
Painted Face?!

1:03:48.784 --> 1:03:50.202
- Well?
- We're dead!

1:03:50.285 --> 1:03:52.120
This isn't the one from before.

1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:02.840
Help...

1:04:02.881 --> 1:04:04.258
Master Wong!

1:04:04.383 --> 1:04:07.386
My Goodness!
Let's go! Run!

1:04:08.637 --> 1:04:11.098
- Run!
- I'm running...

1:04:11.181 --> 1:04:12.349
Run faster!

1:04:15.644 --> 1:04:17.229
Master Wong, you're ignoring me?!

1:04:17.271 --> 1:04:18.981
Aren't I holding on to you?

1:04:21.692 --> 1:04:24.486
Hey, why drag someone at random?

1:04:24.611 --> 1:04:26.113
Bump into a ghost?

1:04:26.196 --> 1:04:28.198
Right, I'm haunted by a demon!

1:04:30.367 --> 1:04:32.911
Catching demons?
I'm quite the expert.

1:04:33.495 --> 1:04:37.499
Where's the demon...?

1:04:38.584 --> 1:04:40.586
- B-b-behind you!
- Run!

1:04:42.713 --> 1:04:44.298
Wow!
Powerful demon!

1:04:44.798 --> 1:04:48.802
God of Heaven, bless this handbell
and sword with fighting spirit.

1:04:48.886 --> 1:04:50.220
I attack!

1:05:05.944 --> 1:05:08.906
WHITE CRANE MASTERS' ANCESTRAL TABLET

1:05:20.959 --> 1:05:21.960
Master, some tea.

1:05:22.002 --> 1:05:23.462
<i>Wong Fei-Hung!</i>

1:05:23.921 --> 1:05:25.505
You great cuckold!

1:05:25.631 --> 1:05:26.965
Get out here now!

1:05:27.007 --> 1:05:28.216
Oh, big trouble!

1:05:29.927 --> 1:05:31.261
Come out now!

1:05:32.971 --> 1:05:34.765
May I know your name?

1:05:35.807 --> 1:05:37.142
He's our boss.

1:05:37.267 --> 1:05:38.977
Chief Constable of the Seven Provinces.

1:05:39.519 --> 1:05:40.729
Bau Tang-Chun.

1:05:40.854 --> 1:05:41.980
It's an honour to meet you.

1:05:42.022 --> 1:05:44.107
I'm here to arrest Wong Fei-Hung.

1:05:44.149 --> 1:05:46.360
It's none of your business.
Step aside.

1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:51.281
Constable,
have you ever met Wong Fei-Hung?

1:05:51.615 --> 1:05:54.618
More than met,
I've even fought with him.

1:05:54.910 --> 1:05:56.620
You've fought with him?

1:05:57.162 --> 1:05:59.790
Then,
does Wong Fei-Hung look like me?

1:06:00.207 --> 1:06:02.376
Pfft!
Wong Fei-Hung's a very young man.

1:06:02.417 --> 1:06:04.044
At most, 18-20 years old.

1:06:04.294 --> 1:06:09.341
Really? If Wong Fei-Hung's that young,
then I'll treat you to tea.

1:06:09.675 --> 1:06:12.928
Right, so why then did you call
Wong Fei-Hung a great cuckold?

1:06:12.970 --> 1:06:13.971
You!

1:06:17.057 --> 1:06:20.310
I didn't judge you,
so why do you judge me?

1:06:20.394 --> 1:06:22.896
Constable,
I'll get to the point.

1:06:23.563 --> 1:06:25.065
I'm Wong Fei-Hung.

1:06:25.440 --> 1:06:29.236
You're Wong Fei-Hung...'s dad?!

1:06:33.281 --> 1:06:35.283
Wong Fei-Hung, don't you run!

1:06:35.534 --> 1:06:37.244
That was my apprenticeship tea!

1:06:37.619 --> 1:06:39.246
Escaping once again?!

1:06:39.287 --> 1:06:40.330
Catch him!

1:06:40.372 --> 1:06:41.456
Master!

1:06:43.500 --> 1:06:44.835
<i>He's</i> Wong Fei-Hung?

1:06:44.876 --> 1:06:46.545
Correct!
That's him.

1:06:46.628 --> 1:06:48.005
That young man
played a part, too!

1:07:06.106 --> 1:07:07.607
Shirt Grappling?

1:07:07.691 --> 1:07:08.817
Stop it!

1:07:12.237 --> 1:07:13.739
You two, on your knees!

1:07:15.657 --> 1:07:17.117
- Master.
- Master Wong.

1:07:22.247 --> 1:07:24.416
How can you both be so brazen?

1:07:24.708 --> 1:07:27.127
Stirring up trouble out there in my name?!

1:07:27.169 --> 1:07:29.713
Ah, you really <i>are</i> Wong Fei-Hung!

1:07:29.838 --> 1:07:31.048
The genuine article.

1:07:31.089 --> 1:07:33.842
Constable, please,
if only for my sake...

1:07:33.925 --> 1:07:36.887
Let me deal with these
two unworthy apprentices!

1:07:39.139 --> 1:07:40.390
OK, Wong Fei-Hung!

1:07:40.515 --> 1:07:44.061
This time, I'll give you face
and investigate no further.

1:07:44.269 --> 1:07:45.437
Chief Constable...

1:07:47.397 --> 1:07:48.565
thanks for giving me face.

1:07:48.607 --> 1:07:50.734
Tonight,
I'll arrange a dinner upstairs

1:07:50.942 --> 1:07:52.736
as an apology to you.

1:07:52.944 --> 1:07:54.529
If you know what's good for you.

1:07:56.406 --> 1:07:58.658
Foon!
Follow me!

1:08:06.291 --> 1:08:07.459
Master Wong!

1:08:12.130 --> 1:08:14.591
You already know Shirt Grappling.

1:08:15.217 --> 1:08:17.052
There's no point
in having me as your master.

1:08:17.761 --> 1:08:18.762
Get out!

1:08:25.060 --> 1:08:27.479
Shirt Grappling?

1:08:37.739 --> 1:08:39.199
<i>Thanks for giving me face.</i>

1:08:39.658 --> 1:08:41.409
Master Wong,
no need to thank me.

1:08:41.493 --> 1:08:42.911
Let me first pay my respects.

1:08:43.161 --> 1:08:44.287
Cheers...

1:08:47.290 --> 1:08:49.960
Master Wong,
I propose a toast to you.

1:08:50.710 --> 1:08:52.003
You flatter me.

1:08:52.295 --> 1:08:53.380
Thanks...

1:08:55.715 --> 1:08:57.008
Everyone, cheers!

1:08:57.300 --> 1:08:58.802
I'll do it myself...

1:08:59.136 --> 1:09:01.096
It's such an honour
to get to know Master Wong.

1:09:01.138 --> 1:09:02.180
Such kind words.

1:09:03.014 --> 1:09:04.891
Let's eat
Please, let's eat.

1:09:05.016 --> 1:09:06.143
Let's eat.

1:09:14.943 --> 1:09:18.196
Under the circumstances, I've no chance
of becoming Master Wong's apprentice.

1:09:20.157 --> 1:09:21.199
Let's go.

1:09:24.578 --> 1:09:26.580
We two are brothers for life.

1:09:26.997 --> 1:09:28.790
I have to find a way.

1:09:37.883 --> 1:09:39.092
Got it!

1:09:39.885 --> 1:09:41.011
What?

1:09:45.056 --> 1:09:46.057
You...

1:09:48.852 --> 1:09:51.771
Last time, when your hero
saved the beauty, you were mighty.

1:09:54.816 --> 1:09:57.485
This time,
your heroism will be even mightier!

1:09:58.486 --> 1:10:00.697
I don't want to be mighty!

1:10:01.031 --> 1:10:03.783
Win my master's sympathy
and there's a chance.

1:10:04.492 --> 1:10:06.494
Right, just like that!
Let's go!

1:10:07.245 --> 1:10:09.539
Master... this time, it's bad!

1:10:09.956 --> 1:10:11.082
What's the matter?

1:10:11.166 --> 1:10:13.418
Master,
a gang just robbed the bank.

1:10:13.752 --> 1:10:16.171
Mok Geung bravely stepped forward,
valiantly facing the enemy.

1:10:16.213 --> 1:10:18.757
Heavily outnumbered, he resisted,
and fought off the thieves.

1:10:18.798 --> 1:10:20.050
It was chaos!

1:10:20.091 --> 1:10:21.134
What was the outcome?

1:10:21.218 --> 1:10:22.510
Tragic.

1:10:23.511 --> 1:10:25.138
He was seriously injured.

1:10:25.430 --> 1:10:27.265
Was there a patrol on the scene?

1:10:28.391 --> 1:10:30.894
They ran off
upon encountering the thieves.

1:10:33.021 --> 1:10:34.940
Master,
Mok Geung acted courageously.

1:10:34.981 --> 1:10:37.359
Can you treat him
and accept him as an apprentice?

1:10:37.901 --> 1:10:38.985
Little Geung!

1:10:39.444 --> 1:10:41.029
He's so injured he can't stand.

1:10:52.999 --> 1:10:54.501
Your injuries are most unusual.

1:10:55.085 --> 1:10:57.879
Alright,
I'll treat you in a most unusual way.

1:10:58.296 --> 1:11:00.382
What unusual way?

1:11:01.758 --> 1:11:03.927
Your heart's been beaten askew.

1:11:03.969 --> 1:11:06.471
I'll need to open up your sternum
to cure you.

1:11:07.597 --> 1:11:11.184
I'll cut a hole in your chest
and shift your heart straight.

1:11:11.309 --> 1:11:14.562
Then re-start your heart
and stitch back the flesh.

1:11:15.105 --> 1:11:16.856
Your injury will be healed.

1:11:18.191 --> 1:11:19.567
He can stand it.

1:11:25.365 --> 1:11:28.285
Master Wong, is this knife suitable?

1:11:32.706 --> 1:11:33.707
Barely.

1:11:33.790 --> 1:11:35.417
Foon!
Hold him down!

1:11:37.002 --> 1:11:39.004
I'm fine!
I'm fine now!

1:11:39.963 --> 1:11:41.506
- Hey...
- Foon!

1:11:42.132 --> 1:11:43.258
Come back.

1:11:44.592 --> 1:11:45.969
Prepare a toast to the chief.

1:11:46.177 --> 1:11:50.557
Yes, I always find
it's best to forgive and forget.

1:11:53.518 --> 1:11:55.145
We two, brothers for life?

1:11:55.186 --> 1:11:56.730
What a lousy plan!

1:12:01.276 --> 1:12:02.360
Master Wong...

1:12:02.485 --> 1:12:05.822
Hey, you should be on duty.

1:12:07.157 --> 1:12:09.034
Master Wong, excuse us...

1:12:09.117 --> 1:12:10.327
You're welcome.

1:12:11.244 --> 1:12:12.370
As you please...

1:12:14.539 --> 1:12:16.124
We're going now.

1:12:21.880 --> 1:12:24.632
<i>- At the age of 18...</i>
- Hey...

1:12:25.133 --> 1:12:29.512
Shove off!
<i>Bought a pack of crunchy peanuts</i>

1:12:33.808 --> 1:12:34.893
<i>White-Fronted Tiger!</i>

1:12:35.310 --> 1:12:36.770
You're responsible for 17 major cases.

1:12:36.895 --> 1:12:39.814
Even if you run to Guangzhou,
we'll bring you to justice.

1:12:39.898 --> 1:12:40.982
Look out!

1:12:42.984 --> 1:12:45.987
<i>At the age of 28...</i>

1:12:58.792 --> 1:13:01.336
Evil cat, you almost scared me
into pissing my pants!

1:13:01.586 --> 1:13:03.046
Speaking of which...
I really need a piss now.

1:13:03.088 --> 1:13:04.422
I do, too!

1:13:04.881 --> 1:13:06.257
Let's do it over there.

1:13:11.846 --> 1:13:14.015
Hey... just do it here.

1:13:18.561 --> 1:13:19.771
Pissing?

1:13:23.149 --> 1:13:25.318
You two, I was wrong before.

1:13:25.527 --> 1:13:28.780
Please say a few nice words
in front of Wong Fei-Hung,

1:13:28.905 --> 1:13:30.573
so he won't be angry with me.

1:13:31.491 --> 1:13:33.993
- Surely...
- Not!

1:13:46.881 --> 1:13:47.882
Hey!

1:13:51.803 --> 1:13:53.388
URINATION IS FORBIDDEN HERE

1:13:54.681 --> 1:13:56.056
I'm a cop.

1:13:56.057 --> 1:13:57.851
If I want to piss here,
I'll piss here!

1:13:57.892 --> 1:13:59.894
Don't peep, else I can't sprinkle.

1:14:03.022 --> 1:14:05.191
Brother, stop playing...

1:14:22.667 --> 1:14:24.669
You...

1:14:31.926 --> 1:14:35.972
Help...

1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:38.725
Little Geung!

1:14:39.017 --> 1:14:40.894
Those two policemen,
they're dead!

1:14:42.437 --> 1:14:44.188
- For real or not?
- For real!

1:14:44.189 --> 1:14:45.689
Hey, where are they?

1:14:45.690 --> 1:14:47.567
They're out front.

1:14:48.276 --> 1:14:49.694
See, over there.

1:14:53.406 --> 1:14:55.950
Brother Foon,
that Painted Face did it!

1:14:56.117 --> 1:14:57.619
Painted Face, again?

1:15:00.705 --> 1:15:03.208
It may be connected to the opera troupe.

1:15:03.583 --> 1:15:05.793
I already thought of that.
You needn't say it!

1:15:05.877 --> 1:15:09.339
Chief Bau,
if you need help with this case,

1:15:10.048 --> 1:15:11.341
don't hesitate to ask.

1:15:11.841 --> 1:15:12.842
No need.

1:15:12.884 --> 1:15:14.260
I'm the Chief Constable
of the Seven Provinces.

1:15:14.302 --> 1:15:17.388
When handling a case,
I never hit a brick wall.

1:15:19.766 --> 1:15:20.642
Reporting, Chief Bau!

1:15:20.683 --> 1:15:22.602
All those with painted faces
have been arrested.

1:15:22.644 --> 1:15:24.604
But I don't know which one's the murderer.

1:15:30.109 --> 1:15:31.569
Be quiet!

1:15:44.165 --> 1:15:45.208
Reporting!

1:15:45.583 --> 1:15:47.585
- Who's the murderer?
- Get lost!

1:15:48.586 --> 1:15:49.796
Reporting!

1:15:55.426 --> 1:15:57.011
Chief, you're making a mistake!

1:15:57.053 --> 1:15:59.013
I still have to appear on stage.

1:16:03.017 --> 1:16:04.561
Cross-eyes!

1:16:05.562 --> 1:16:06.563
Reporting!

1:16:06.771 --> 1:16:10.775
Have <i>all</i> those with painted faces
been arrested?

1:16:10.900 --> 1:16:13.069
Yes!
None have slipped the net.

1:16:13.194 --> 1:16:14.696
Then what about him?

1:16:16.531 --> 1:16:17.739
That fish slipped the net!

1:16:17.740 --> 1:16:19.117
Brainless!

1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:20.994
- Good-for-nothing!
- R-r-reporting!

1:16:21.202 --> 1:16:22.495
Hey, stay there!

1:16:24.706 --> 1:16:26.583
- Out of the way!
- Move it!

1:16:28.668 --> 1:16:30.545
Where d'you think you're going?

1:16:31.921 --> 1:16:33.506
Hey, what are you doing?

1:16:39.220 --> 1:16:41.514
Shut up, or I'll arrest you!

1:16:41.806 --> 1:16:43.516
I'm warning you;
you're obstructing police business!

1:16:46.102 --> 1:16:48.021
You're still at it?!

1:16:49.105 --> 1:16:50.773
What am I going to do now?

1:16:51.065 --> 1:16:52.191
Reporting!

1:16:53.109 --> 1:16:54.235
Good-for-nothing!

1:16:55.361 --> 1:16:57.447
- What am I going to do now?
- Good-for-nothing!

1:17:08.249 --> 1:17:11.919
Brother, if you see anyone suspicious,
let me know right away.

1:17:11.961 --> 1:17:13.338
There's a bonus.

1:17:18.968 --> 1:17:20.136
Cheeky bastard!

1:17:22.555 --> 1:17:25.224
Brother Kwan, someone disguised with a
painted face has been murdering people.

1:17:25.308 --> 1:17:27.060
I suspect it's someone from the troupe.

1:17:27.101 --> 1:17:28.519
Keep an eye out for me.

1:17:28.728 --> 1:17:29.812
Really?

1:17:32.315 --> 1:17:35.151
Oh, yeah!
Just recently a guy acting strange came,

1:17:35.193 --> 1:17:37.362
- and...
<i>- Brother Kwan, you're due on stage.</i>

1:17:37.487 --> 1:17:39.030
- OK, I'm coming!
- But, Brother Kwan...

1:17:39.072 --> 1:17:42.700
Come backstage after the show's over
and I'll tell you then.

1:17:47.664 --> 1:17:50.667
<i>I hate most the people of Po Chi Lam.</i>

1:17:51.501 --> 1:17:54.504
Now they suspect you, too!

1:17:57.465 --> 1:17:59.801
We can cooperate with each other.

1:18:00.968 --> 1:18:02.345
You help me...

1:18:06.391 --> 1:18:09.435
After it's done,
I'll send you to Nanyang.

1:18:10.186 --> 1:18:14.190
From then on,
you'll be beyond the arm of the law.

1:18:15.191 --> 1:18:19.070
However, I'm afraid you're no match
for Wong Fei-Hung.

1:18:26.661 --> 1:18:30.581
LONGEVITY

1:18:38.589 --> 1:18:40.007
- Congratulations...
- Big Brother.

1:18:40.049 --> 1:18:41.509
- Go have a drink.
- Oh, alright...

1:18:41.843 --> 1:18:43.469
- County Commissioner.
- Thanks.

1:18:43.511 --> 1:18:46.764
- County Commissioner.
- Please go inside...

1:18:48.316 --> 1:18:49.683
- County Commissioner.
- Congratulations, Master Wong.

1:18:49.684 --> 1:18:50.643
Longevity...

1:18:50.685 --> 1:18:52.644
Please sit, County Commissioner.
Please sit over here.

1:18:52.645 --> 1:18:55.148
Chief Bau is here!

1:18:55.440 --> 1:18:57.108
- Chief Bau.
- Master Wong, congratulations...

1:18:57.150 --> 1:18:59.568
- Have a few drinks tonight.
- Don't worry, I won't go home sober!

1:18:59.569 --> 1:19:00.695
Please, have a seat.

1:19:02.155 --> 1:19:03.906
- County Commissioner.
- Chief Bau.

1:19:04.657 --> 1:19:05.658
Hey!

1:19:07.410 --> 1:19:08.953
Chiu Yuk-Kwan asked to meet me
at the theatre tonight.

1:19:08.995 --> 1:19:10.955
- I'm going out for a while.
- Then I'm going, too!

1:19:10.997 --> 1:19:12.790
What for?
You'll just get in the way.

1:19:15.084 --> 1:19:15.917
LONGEVITY

1:19:17.795 --> 1:19:19.422
Brother Foon, I-I-I'm afraid.

1:19:19.464 --> 1:19:21.591
Afraid... of what?
Afraid I'll die?

1:19:21.674 --> 1:19:22.800
- Lifelong...
- Brothers?

1:19:22.842 --> 1:19:23.968
That's right.

1:19:24.010 --> 1:19:25.845
If I die,
you'll have to avenge me.

1:19:26.471 --> 1:19:27.388
Hey!

1:19:27.430 --> 1:19:28.806
What's up?

1:19:30.183 --> 1:19:32.393
This string of silver bells;
it's my family amulet.

1:19:32.477 --> 1:19:33.770
Put it on.

1:19:34.771 --> 1:19:35.855
This thing's pointless.

1:19:35.897 --> 1:19:37.273
You're such an old woman!

1:19:39.609 --> 1:19:41.319
I'll be back before the shark's fin soup!

1:19:43.821 --> 1:19:45.990
Call me an old woman?
Go to hell...

1:20:25.238 --> 1:20:26.697
Chiu Yuk-Kwan?!

1:21:45.568 --> 1:21:47.153
Shadow Transformation?!

1:23:43.269 --> 1:23:45.688
- Everyone, please eat your fill.
- Everyone...

1:23:45.771 --> 1:23:48.733
- Master Wong, please.
- You're welcome. Cheers...

1:24:16.969 --> 1:24:19.430
Next it's Wong Fei-Hung.

1:24:19.513 --> 1:24:21.807
- Our benefactor.
- Cheers...

1:24:33.444 --> 1:24:35.237
Excuse me.
Permit me.

1:24:35.362 --> 1:24:36.447
Make way.

1:24:44.330 --> 1:24:46.082
Foon!

1:24:46.123 --> 1:24:49.794
Brother Foon...

1:24:50.377 --> 1:24:51.629
When I said 'go to hell'
I didn't mean it!

1:24:51.670 --> 1:24:53.631
Brother Foon...

1:24:53.714 --> 1:24:56.634
When I said 'go to hell'
I didn't mean it!

1:24:58.260 --> 1:24:59.512
Brother Foon.

1:25:00.554 --> 1:25:02.264
Where had Ah Foon gone?

1:25:03.641 --> 1:25:04.850
The theatre.

1:25:04.934 --> 1:25:06.143
The theatre?!

1:25:13.442 --> 1:25:14.568
Brother Foon.

1:25:15.111 --> 1:25:17.279
If I die,
you'll have to avenge me.

1:25:43.806 --> 1:25:45.014
Painted Face...

1:25:45.015 --> 1:25:46.891
<i>Painted face!</i>

1:25:46.892 --> 1:25:48.060
KILL

1:25:48.185 --> 1:25:49.228
<i>Painted face!</i>

1:26:54.293 --> 1:26:55.126
Painted Face...

1:27:05.221 --> 1:27:06.639
Bau Tang-Chun?!

1:27:16.732 --> 1:27:19.652
Kid, you rushed here,
and for what?

1:27:19.693 --> 1:27:21.820
I think you'll die without knowing why!

1:27:21.862 --> 1:27:22.988
I'll know!

1:27:26.075 --> 1:27:28.661
Your purpose's just to deal with me.

1:27:29.119 --> 1:27:31.080
Why did you kill my apprentice,
Leung Foon?

1:27:32.498 --> 1:27:33.916
He was killed by White-Fronted Tiger.

1:27:34.083 --> 1:27:36.126
You're harbouring a wanted criminal!

1:27:38.045 --> 1:27:39.838
Yeah, so?

1:27:40.714 --> 1:27:43.968
If you don't die today,
then I, Tam Hing, can't hold my head high.

1:27:45.302 --> 1:27:46.887
I'll have my Lion's Roar Hall
without your Po Chi Lam!

1:27:47.054 --> 1:27:48.597
This land has the rule of law.

1:27:48.639 --> 1:27:51.100
I must capture you
and take you to be punished by the law.

1:27:51.350 --> 1:27:52.977
Let me punish you first!

1:28:12.037 --> 1:28:13.247
Master Wong!

1:28:41.358 --> 1:28:42.443
Don't!

1:28:42.860 --> 1:28:45.070
Master Wong... spare my life.

1:28:45.321 --> 1:28:46.530
Let me go!

1:28:46.822 --> 1:28:49.241
I know I was wrong.
Let me go!

1:28:49.408 --> 1:28:51.410
From now on I won't dare!

1:29:00.794 --> 1:29:01.920
Look out!

1:29:04.340 --> 1:29:06.342
Master Wong, I'm sorry!

1:29:23.484 --> 1:29:24.693
Little Geung, leave me!

1:29:24.735 --> 1:29:25.736
I won't!

1:29:25.778 --> 1:29:27.988
If I ignore you, Master,
am I still human?

1:29:44.505 --> 1:29:45.798
Flowing Cloud Flying Sleeve?!

1:31:03.584 --> 1:31:04.960
Scrub...

1:31:24.313 --> 1:31:26.023
Scrub...

1:31:28.317 --> 1:31:31.195
Scrub...

1:31:34.656 --> 1:31:37.159
Scrub...

1:34:44.846 --> 1:34:46.807
Hey...
Go on...

1:35:00.404 --> 1:35:04.908
Scrub...

1:35:06.118 --> 1:35:13.118
I'll beat you to death...

1:35:18.088 --> 1:35:20.298
Little Geung,
don't beat him anymore.

1:35:21.383 --> 1:35:23.218
He's already dead.

1:35:29.224 --> 1:35:36.224
I killed Painted Face...

1:35:37.315 --> 1:35:38.316
Little Geung!
