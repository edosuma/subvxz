00:42.008 --> 00:44.711
(ominous music)

00:48.615 --> 00:51.317
(upbeat dance music)

01:12.472 --> 01:15.075
- Let's go, let's go.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.142
- I know Tony.

01:16.142 --> 01:17.410
- Everybody knows Tony.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.179
Get the fuck out,
stay the fuck out.

02:06.326 --> 02:10.263
- Hey, man, what have you got?

02:14.801 --> 02:16.136
Fucking sweet.

02:21.708 --> 02:24.010
(sniffing)

02:28.248 --> 02:30.416
Where did you get this shit?

02:30.416 --> 02:33.153
(ominous music)

02:35.088 --> 02:36.689
So are you new in town or?

02:44.998 --> 02:46.232
What the fuck?

02:50.103 --> 02:51.004
Fuck off me.

03:01.881 --> 03:04.684
Help, help, please
somebody help!

03:06.786 --> 03:09.055
(coughing)

03:27.907 --> 03:30.210
(stabbing)

03:45.725 --> 03:47.961
(gasping)

04:05.578 --> 04:08.214
(upbeat music)

04:43.249 --> 04:44.284
- Of course not.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.925
(lyrics muffled)

05:20.453 --> 05:21.988
- [Tony] What happened
to the bed and breakfast

05:21.988 --> 05:24.524
you opened up in Ogunquit
with your boyfriend there?

05:25.625 --> 05:27.260
- It just didn't pan out.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.729
- Never, ever go into
business with your boyfriend.

05:29.729 --> 05:31.230
Didn't I tell you that?

05:31.230 --> 05:32.632
- Not that I can recall.

05:33.666 --> 05:36.669
- So you want your job back.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.238
- Tony, I'll take any
shift you can give me.

05:46.145 --> 05:48.548
(growling)

05:48.548 --> 05:50.049
- Can I get you to push
some of this shit around?

05:50.049 --> 05:51.484
I got a guy but he
keeps coming back short,

05:51.484 --> 05:52.719
he's a fucking junkie.

05:56.322 --> 05:58.391
- That's not the kind
of job I was looking for

05:58.391 --> 06:00.827
and I don't really think
I'd be any good at that.

06:01.894 --> 06:03.730
- Yeah, I suppose you
wouldn't be, would you?

06:06.299 --> 06:07.867
Look, I'm not
short on bartenders

06:07.867 --> 06:09.902
but you're a hard
worker, I remember that.

06:09.902 --> 06:12.705
Come down on Tuesday
night, I'll squeeze you in.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.907
- Are Tuesdays still karaoke?

06:14.907 --> 06:16.242
- That's all I got right now.

06:16.242 --> 06:17.510
So don't come in
and asking for more.

06:17.510 --> 06:18.845
- Thank you, Tuesday's fine.

06:18.845 --> 06:20.079
- The club ain't the
same as it used to be,

06:20.079 --> 06:22.181
got a younger crowd
now, different speed.

06:22.181 --> 06:24.517
- But do they still call
you Tony Two Fingers?

06:24.517 --> 06:25.785
(growling)

06:25.785 --> 06:27.420
Tuesday is cool, I'll
see you Tuesday, Tony.

06:27.420 --> 06:28.388
Thank you, thanks.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.925
- Who the fuck am I gonna
get to push this shit around?

06:32.925 --> 06:36.062
(upbeat rock music)

06:38.164 --> 06:41.634
- Oh my God.

06:41.634 --> 06:43.836
Hold the fucking phone.

06:43.836 --> 06:45.071
(chuckling)

06:45.071 --> 06:47.140
- It's not that big
of a deal, Brian.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.675
- It's still exciting.

06:49.675 --> 06:54.213
I mean, Tuesday isn't
really that exciting

06:54.213 --> 06:55.281
but it is something.

06:56.649 --> 07:00.787
And you're gonna be working
at the same bar as Janet,

07:00.787 --> 07:02.889
and she's performing tonight.

07:02.889 --> 07:05.892
You, me, we're going
out on the town

07:05.892 --> 07:08.027
and celebrating your job.

07:08.027 --> 07:10.897
- No, I think I just
wanna lay low tonight.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.935
- Don't be such a Les Mis.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.570
There's a whole world
out there, Dwayne,

07:17.570 --> 07:19.839
and you need to start
living your life.

07:19.839 --> 07:21.674
We're going out.

07:21.674 --> 07:24.811
You're buying the
drinks, bitch, bye.

07:24.811 --> 07:25.711
- Whatever.

07:26.913 --> 07:30.049
- So just a heads up,

07:30.049 --> 07:33.319
but there is a guy that's
gonna meet us there at the bar.

07:33.319 --> 07:34.487
- What?

07:34.487 --> 07:36.889
- Don't be weird about it.

07:36.889 --> 07:39.058
It's just some guy
that I met off Poundr.

07:40.159 --> 07:42.161
- So I'm the third wheel?

07:42.161 --> 07:45.331
- No, it's not like that at all.

07:45.331 --> 07:49.168
Listen, he's a grad
student, super handsome

07:49.168 --> 07:51.103
and did I mention, a top!

07:52.872 --> 07:53.773
(dance music)

08:00.813 --> 08:01.714
Enchanté

08:02.849 --> 08:04.150
- Brian?

08:04.150 --> 08:05.651
- The one and only.

08:08.254 --> 08:11.457
Oh my God, you look just
like your profile picture.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.228
Oh, this is my friend, Dwayne.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.796
He just moved back here

08:16.796 --> 08:19.265
but he just got out
of a relationship

08:19.265 --> 08:22.001
so he's a little
vulnerable right now.

08:23.102 --> 08:24.504
- Hey, what's up?

08:32.311 --> 08:34.547
- So then I was
in the production

08:34.547 --> 08:36.916
of "You're Good
Man, Charlie Brown."

08:36.916 --> 08:39.418
I was Snoopy.

08:39.418 --> 08:41.120
- Snoopy had lines?

08:41.120 --> 08:42.855
- Yeah, Snoopy had lines.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.858
Not to mention the choreography.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.326
I was the red baron.

08:49.762 --> 08:51.664
- What ever happened
to Gloria Hole?

08:51.664 --> 08:53.032
- Who is Gloria Hole?

08:54.033 --> 08:55.935
- Gloria Troll?

08:55.935 --> 08:59.238
What happened was
whiskey, gravity

08:59.238 --> 09:02.074
and some basic song choices.

09:02.074 --> 09:04.544
Janet Fitness is
the future of drag.

09:05.778 --> 09:06.913
- [Announcer] Now
the performance

09:06.913 --> 09:08.147
you've all been waiting for,

09:08.147 --> 09:10.383
the queen with the
best body in Providence

09:10.383 --> 09:11.918
- Oh my God, it's her,
this is Janet Fitness.

09:11.918 --> 09:14.120
- [Announcer] Put your hands
together for Janet Fitness.

10:31.397 --> 10:33.899
She's a hashtag goddess.

10:33.899 --> 10:35.201
I haven't really felt this way

10:35.201 --> 10:38.204
since I first discovered
Idina Menzel, you know?

10:38.204 --> 10:40.840
- Dude, I'm not feeling this.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.375
- What?

10:42.375 --> 10:44.276
- No offense, but I like
dudes who act like dudes.

10:44.276 --> 10:45.811
- Excuse the mouth?!

10:45.811 --> 10:47.647
- And for the record, I'm
not into blacks either.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.815
So you know what, I'm
gonna go get a drink

10:49.815 --> 10:52.018
and you guys do your own thing.

10:52.018 --> 10:52.885
Ciao.

10:55.354 --> 10:56.222
- Ciao?

10:58.257 --> 11:00.526
Who even says ciao anymore?

11:02.228 --> 11:03.396
This is awful.

11:04.230 --> 11:05.865
- Fuck that dude.

11:05.865 --> 11:08.668
- I douched for this.

11:08.668 --> 11:12.672
- What the fuck
is up, Providence?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.607
How y'all doing tonight?

11:14.607 --> 11:17.076
(audience applauding)

11:17.076 --> 11:19.011
We have a special
treat for you tonight.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.113
We have Audrey Heartburn,

11:23.282 --> 11:24.216
slutty shot boys,

11:26.118 --> 11:28.087
and a fat ass contest

11:28.087 --> 11:30.222
which some of you
should enter right now.

11:31.490 --> 11:34.260
Are you ready to have a blast?

11:34.260 --> 11:35.561
Woo!

11:35.561 --> 11:38.731
(upbeat dance music)

12:02.621 --> 12:03.556
- Fuck you.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.793
- Janet, you were
great out there.

12:40.793 --> 12:42.061
- Bitch, I know.

13:04.583 --> 13:07.086
Mirror, mirror on the wall.

13:09.054 --> 13:10.489
Why even bother asking?

13:11.423 --> 13:13.826
(laughing)

13:46.392 --> 13:47.293
- Hey man.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.063
You in here?

14:10.449 --> 14:11.350
Alright.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.167
Oh yeah.

14:28.167 --> 14:30.402
(moaning)

14:33.973 --> 14:34.874
Oh yeah.

14:36.876 --> 14:37.776
Oh fuck.

14:43.315 --> 14:44.717
Hey, why'd you stop?

14:45.684 --> 14:46.986
(ominous music)

14:46.986 --> 14:49.989
(grinder cranking)

14:56.829 --> 14:59.832
Dude, are you gonna
suck it or not?

15:02.368 --> 15:03.769
Watch the teeth.

15:05.871 --> 15:08.974
Dude, watch the fucking teeth!

15:08.974 --> 15:11.710
(intense music)

15:51.450 --> 15:54.119
(pan sizzling)

15:57.489 --> 15:58.991
(groaning)

15:58.991 --> 16:02.795
- I cannot believe that
that self-loathing,

16:02.795 --> 16:07.900
misogynistic and
racist fucking faggot

16:09.001 --> 16:12.438
had the audacity to
be such a faggot.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.675
- Well you dodged a fucking
bullet ditching that one.

16:16.675 --> 16:18.043
- A bullet?

16:18.043 --> 16:20.446
I dodged a God damn clip.

16:20.446 --> 16:22.915
Are you fucking kidding
me, I'm too fem?

16:26.285 --> 16:29.021
Did you catch that
motherfucker's penny loafers?

16:30.756 --> 16:32.091
- Thanks for breakfast.

16:32.091 --> 16:34.460
- Please, it's the
least that I could do

16:34.460 --> 16:36.295
after you took care
of me last night.

16:36.295 --> 16:39.131
I don't even remember
what happened.

16:39.131 --> 16:41.600
- There's not much to remember.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.701
Don't worry about it.

16:47.473 --> 16:50.109
- You never told
me what happened.

16:50.109 --> 16:51.910
- About the rest of last night?

16:51.910 --> 16:53.178
- No, fuck last night.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.080
I wanna know what
happened with you

16:55.080 --> 16:57.583
in the bed and
breakfast in Ogunquit.

16:57.583 --> 17:01.453
You just said, oh, it didn't
work out and left it at that.

17:01.453 --> 17:03.589
- There's not much more
else to say about that.

17:03.589 --> 17:06.791
- Dwayne, are we not friends?

17:06.791 --> 17:08.093
Are we not close?

17:08.093 --> 17:10.262
You can talk to me.

17:15.099 --> 17:16.435
- There was someone else.

17:17.403 --> 17:18.503
There was another guy.

17:18.503 --> 17:19.972
- Mm.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.808
- And at first I started to
like, feel him change, you know?

17:22.808 --> 17:24.643
But I thought that was just
how like relationships go.

17:24.643 --> 17:26.045
You get used to
seeing each other

17:26.045 --> 17:28.380
every God damn
day of your lives.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.816
And then I started
to think that maybe

17:30.816 --> 17:31.950
he was getting bored with me,

17:31.950 --> 17:34.153
that it was
something that I did.

17:34.153 --> 17:36.555
And then there was someone else.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.190
And then I was packing my shit.

17:43.762 --> 17:48.834
- Dwayne, I'm so sorry.

17:49.368 --> 17:50.869
That's so real.

17:50.869 --> 17:54.173
- Whatever, it happens,
I'm sure I'll get over it.

17:54.173 --> 17:55.908
We all end up breaking
up with someone

17:55.908 --> 17:57.409
at some point in our lives.

17:58.243 --> 17:59.144
- I'm sorry.

18:00.479 --> 18:04.183
But listen, you can stay
here for as long as you need,

18:05.451 --> 18:07.252
especially now that
you have a job.

18:10.222 --> 18:13.459
- Oh my God, Tragedi, oh, I
got some tea from last night.

18:13.459 --> 18:16.161
Remember that fucking Arab
guy, like he was back again

18:16.161 --> 18:18.097
and I'm pretty sure
he's obsessed with me

18:18.097 --> 18:20.332
but he was sprouting
that same old BS

18:20.332 --> 18:21.967
just like how he's got the money

18:21.967 --> 18:23.702
and his dad's a
Sheik or something.

18:23.702 --> 18:26.238
I'm like, girl, I don't care
how stylish your dad is.

18:26.238 --> 18:27.272
Like I'm trying to make money.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.241
You are cramping my style.

18:29.241 --> 18:31.777
And like, I don't know,
he's kind of cute though.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.212
I might sleep with him again.

18:33.212 --> 18:36.115
He has a really nice
penis and the sex is good.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.984
Like I'm talking like
in that desperate

18:38.984 --> 18:41.153
like closeted way, you
get what I'm saying?

18:41.153 --> 18:42.221
- Oh.

18:43.489 --> 18:45.858
- Tragedi, what the fuck?

18:46.825 --> 18:47.759
(screaming)

18:47.759 --> 18:49.394
Oh my God, I'm calling Tony!

18:59.037 --> 19:01.974
- Hey, you got
something right there.

19:05.644 --> 19:06.578
- Thank you, sir.

19:09.548 --> 19:12.251
(phone ringing)

19:13.986 --> 19:15.087
- Detective O'Hara.

19:16.788 --> 19:18.557
Hey, T, how's it going?

19:21.393 --> 19:23.962
Yeah, I can, I can swing by,

19:23.962 --> 19:25.864
but I've got my partner with me.

19:26.932 --> 19:28.967
No, my, my detective partner.

19:31.870 --> 19:34.740
All right, we'll be
there in a little bit.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.241
Finish up.

19:36.241 --> 19:38.477
We're gonna see an
old friend of mine.

19:39.811 --> 19:43.615
Oh, but a word of advice,
don't say shit about his hand.

19:48.387 --> 19:51.957
- So yeah, I know the
kid and if I killed him,

19:51.957 --> 19:55.427
which I didn't, why would I
put in my own God damn trash?

19:55.427 --> 19:57.462
- Relax, Tony.

19:57.462 --> 19:59.865
We aren't accusing
you of nothing.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.400
What can you tell us about him?

20:01.400 --> 20:03.168
- Well, I can tell you he
was a fucking coke whore,

20:03.168 --> 20:04.436
how about that?

20:04.436 --> 20:05.704
- Did he push the
stuff around here?

20:05.704 --> 20:07.706
- Yeah, but it was
only a matter of time

20:07.706 --> 20:10.475
before that kid ended up
in a dumpster, come on.

20:10.475 --> 20:15.547
- Yeah, yes, did
he have enemies?

20:16.682 --> 20:18.350
- Fuck do I know,
O'Hara, probably.

20:19.418 --> 20:22.387
- Did you notice
anything suspicious

20:22.387 --> 20:24.323
when you saw him last time?

20:24.323 --> 20:27.492
- Look, Detective
O'Hara and Detective-

20:27.492 --> 20:29.528
- Barry.
- Yeah, right.

20:29.528 --> 20:32.264
Anyways, I can't have this
shit happening at my club.

20:34.032 --> 20:36.301
- You think someone's
trying to sabotage you?

20:36.301 --> 20:38.203
- O'Hara, I didn't
call you two down here

20:38.203 --> 20:39.871
to have a fucking investigation.

20:39.871 --> 20:42.608
You and blueberry get
that fucking trailer trash

20:42.608 --> 20:45.077
junkie gutter whore the
fuck out of my dumpster!

20:46.144 --> 20:48.580
Before it starts
stinking the place up.

20:54.553 --> 20:59.591
- Listen Tony, the
city's, it's changed.

21:01.860 --> 21:03.195
Getting rid of a body

21:03.195 --> 21:05.797
just ain't like it
used to be, you know.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.271
- Make it fucking happen.

21:13.805 --> 21:16.742
- Hey, but it ain't
impossible, right?

21:25.217 --> 21:26.652
- I'm no doctor, O'Hara

21:26.652 --> 21:28.954
but I think somebody
drained this kid's blood.

21:30.322 --> 21:33.058
- We'll just dump it at
PuPu's around the corner.

21:33.058 --> 21:34.426
- The Chinese place?
- Yeah.

21:37.829 --> 21:39.031
Hi, yeah, O'Hara.

21:42.067 --> 21:43.835
All right, we'll
be back in a bit.

21:47.773 --> 21:49.541
- What was that about?

21:49.541 --> 21:52.177
- A Beige University student's
been reported missing.

21:52.177 --> 21:54.479
Mom says he ain't
picking up his phone.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.449
(electronic music)

22:22.674 --> 22:26.044
- Just like my neurologist says,

22:26.044 --> 22:29.281
you can always find
beauty in tragedy.

22:34.252 --> 22:35.921
After all the years
I put in here,

22:35.921 --> 22:37.689
this is what I'm rewarded with.

22:38.957 --> 22:42.427
So the salami sucking,
piece of shit,

22:42.427 --> 22:47.366
meatball fucking filled
with shit fucking fuck.

22:50.602 --> 22:54.439
Tuesday, Tuesday
with Gloria Hole!

22:57.976 --> 23:01.380
Whatever happened, big
numbers, glitz, the glamor.

23:05.751 --> 23:06.618
Replaced.

23:13.892 --> 23:14.793
Do I know you?

23:15.660 --> 23:16.595
- Sort of.

23:16.595 --> 23:18.797
I used to work here before.

23:18.797 --> 23:20.899
- Is it Tito?
- Dwayne.

23:20.899 --> 23:22.667
- Wayne?
- Dwayne.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.202
- Elaine?
- Dwayne.

23:24.202 --> 23:26.104
- Mitchell?
- Dwayne.

23:26.104 --> 23:30.375
Alright, Shane, listen,
two shots of whiskey.

23:31.510 --> 23:34.646
And the good stuff,
not that cheap shit.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.548
I got my eye on you.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.324
Up your ass.

23:52.631 --> 23:53.665
Fuck.

25:20.118 --> 25:22.888
Jesus Christ, can
you fucking knock?

25:22.888 --> 25:25.457
- Tony, I can't do it.

25:25.457 --> 25:29.227
I've worked too hard and too
long to be reduced to this.

25:29.227 --> 25:30.929
- Gloria, we've
been through this.

25:30.929 --> 25:32.464
The people want something new.

25:32.464 --> 25:33.698
Not some old number you yanked

25:33.698 --> 25:35.901
out of your fucking
sarcophagus, come on.

25:35.901 --> 25:37.836
- You remember when
I first got here?

25:39.771 --> 25:44.709
Remember I was all young,
dumb and full of cum.

25:47.078 --> 25:50.715
Remember I worked my ass off.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.717
I'd stay late.

25:52.717 --> 25:55.387
Perfect my number
for the next night.

25:56.354 --> 25:59.324
I paid my God damn dues.

25:59.324 --> 26:00.859
- Oh spare me the
history lesson.

26:00.859 --> 26:02.327
No, one's fucking listening.

26:04.896 --> 26:05.964
- I'll change it up.

26:06.998 --> 26:09.134
- What are you gonna do?

26:09.134 --> 26:13.338
- I'll do a modern number,
something on the radio.

26:13.338 --> 26:14.506
Something people know.

26:16.308 --> 26:18.276
Just give me a fucking
Saturday night.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.815
- Look, Audrey Heartburn won't
be performing this Saturday

26:23.815 --> 26:25.584
at the Masque 4 Masque Ball.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.687
She's under house arrest
for indecent exposure again.

26:28.687 --> 26:30.322
Pretends to be shocked.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.891
Anyways, you can take her slot

26:32.891 --> 26:34.192
but let me tell you something,

26:34.192 --> 26:36.061
if you come in there
and shit on my party,

26:36.061 --> 26:37.729
I'm gonna shit on you.

26:37.729 --> 26:39.130
That means no more
Saturday nights,

26:39.130 --> 26:40.732
no more Tuesday nights

26:40.732 --> 26:43.335
and you can say
say-o-fucking-nara to
those comped drinks

26:43.335 --> 26:44.603
'cause you haven't paid me

26:44.603 --> 26:46.805
a God damn dollar
in fucking years!

26:46.805 --> 26:49.341
- I am a God damn
professional, Tony.

26:52.243 --> 26:54.012
- Oh, and Gloria?

26:54.012 --> 26:57.282
- Yes, Mr. Fingers.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.884
- Why don't you get
yourself a new wig,

26:59.884 --> 27:02.187
that one looks like
a God damn cum rag.

27:10.962 --> 27:13.632
- You know, you can paint
up any kind of child, Tony,

27:14.966 --> 27:19.104
you can even have a
child do cartwheels

27:19.104 --> 27:24.175
all across your
motherfucking stage,

27:25.443 --> 27:29.314
but don't you ever
forget that I will always

27:30.515 --> 27:34.653
be the first lady of Providence.

27:42.627 --> 27:45.563
(sniffing)

27:45.563 --> 27:47.165
- Fucking drag queens.

27:49.868 --> 27:52.937
(electronic music)

28:04.716 --> 28:08.353
- Oh my God.

28:11.156 --> 28:13.525
Janet, how are you?

28:14.459 --> 28:16.194
(kissing)

28:16.194 --> 28:18.496
It's me, Brian.

28:19.631 --> 28:21.566
We've met a couple of times.

28:21.566 --> 28:23.334
You said you'd
sign my head shots.

28:24.736 --> 28:26.237
- Did I?

28:26.237 --> 28:28.873
- Yeah, oh my God, it's
so crazy to run into you.

28:28.873 --> 28:32.911
As you know, I am
also a performer

28:32.911 --> 28:37.082
and I can totally get
you tickets to my show

28:37.082 --> 28:38.817
if you'd like to come.

28:38.817 --> 28:41.352
I just don't know
when it would be.

28:41.352 --> 28:43.788
- You couldn't pay me enough.

28:43.788 --> 28:44.856
- What?

28:46.591 --> 28:47.859
- Did I stutter?

28:51.396 --> 28:53.498
- That was kind of rude.

28:53.498 --> 28:56.134
- And you're kind
of fucking annoying.

28:56.134 --> 29:00.238
- So you're actually
just the worst?

29:00.238 --> 29:03.942
- And you're actually a
walking restraining order.

29:06.745 --> 29:07.712
Nice shirt.

29:26.264 --> 29:28.666
- Oh, fucking piece of shit.

29:32.937 --> 29:35.673
(metal banging)

29:49.020 --> 29:50.155
I-28.

29:51.089 --> 29:51.990
- Bingo.

29:58.229 --> 29:59.464
- You left me,

30:00.565 --> 30:02.400
you left me this
fucking shithole.

30:05.036 --> 30:07.038
It's an embarrassment
of a legacy.

30:09.874 --> 30:11.609
- Look at your drag
daughter now, Ma.

30:12.844 --> 30:13.745
Legendary.

30:15.880 --> 30:16.714
- Hey lady.

30:16.714 --> 30:18.550
I said Bingo.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.119
- Congrat-u-fucking-lations.

30:23.555 --> 30:28.626
You have won a free app at
Papa Fag-a-toni's on the Hill.

30:37.135 --> 30:38.937
- Why are you
wearing that, Brian?

30:40.004 --> 30:42.974
- I'm kind of in a
dark place right now.

30:44.142 --> 30:45.810
- Why did someone die?

30:45.810 --> 30:48.246
- Yes, Janet.

30:48.246 --> 30:49.647
- Wait, She's dead?

30:49.647 --> 30:52.016
- She's not really
dead, she's dead to me.

30:53.918 --> 30:58.189
You would not believe what
she said to me, Dwayne.

30:58.189 --> 31:01.226
What's the thing about
never meeting your idols?

31:01.226 --> 31:02.694
It's so true.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.698
Janet is a fucking monster.

31:06.698 --> 31:09.500
- They're all fucking
monsters, Brian.

31:09.500 --> 31:13.338
Janet, Audrey, that go-go
boy, especially Tony.

31:13.338 --> 31:14.739
Why is it always the
worst fucking people

31:14.739 --> 31:16.107
are in positions of power?

31:17.709 --> 31:19.077
- You don't think
that's a little harsh?

31:19.077 --> 31:20.478
- Whatever.

31:20.478 --> 31:21.746
I'm just so sick of these gigs.

31:21.746 --> 31:24.616
Being like treated
like a peasant,

31:24.616 --> 31:26.918
always the lowest
rung on the ladder.

31:26.918 --> 31:28.987
I think if I have to
cocktail one more time,

31:28.987 --> 31:30.521
I might just slice
someone's fucking throat.

31:30.521 --> 31:34.993
- I mean you did just
start there again.

31:34.993 --> 31:36.327
Maybe things have changed.

31:36.327 --> 31:37.896
Maybe it will be different.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.765
- No, nothing has
fucking changed, alright?

31:40.765 --> 31:43.134
Tony already asked me sell
fucking cocaine for him.

31:43.134 --> 31:44.135
He's still treating
his employees

31:44.135 --> 31:45.837
like they're fucking disposable.

31:45.837 --> 31:47.805
Some way to run a
fucking business.

31:47.805 --> 31:50.141
Look, it's getting late,
I gotta go to work.

31:51.809 --> 31:56.848
- Dwayne, there is nothing
wrong with being working class.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.919
- Just wish me luck.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.221
- Try not to kill anyone.

32:04.188 --> 32:05.123
- No promises.

32:12.964 --> 32:14.399
- I'm back, bitch.

32:15.500 --> 32:18.236
- Audrey, what are
you doing here?

32:18.236 --> 32:20.271
I thought you were
on house arrest.

32:20.271 --> 32:22.607
- Let's just say the
judge changed his mind

32:22.607 --> 32:25.376
after I found him on Poundr.

32:26.511 --> 32:28.913
- You little slut.

32:28.913 --> 32:32.817
- This hoe needs some dough.

32:34.118 --> 32:37.522
I'm ready for this
masquerade ball.

32:38.890 --> 32:40.391
- Oh, you didn't hear?

32:41.626 --> 32:44.696
Tony gave your spot
to Gloria Troll.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.030
Better luck next year.

32:46.931 --> 32:48.399
- Gloria Hole?

32:50.234 --> 32:53.738
Well, assuming she'll
make it until then.

32:53.738 --> 32:56.074
Besides I wouldn't want my name

32:56.074 --> 33:00.211
on the same flyer as
that beat up old hole.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.315
You mind if I use your mirror?

33:04.315 --> 33:08.553
- Sure, go ahead, sister.

33:08.553 --> 33:11.556
Beat that reptilian
mug for the gods.

33:11.556 --> 33:13.725
Really, take your time,

33:13.725 --> 33:15.827
because if you're
gonna have two faces,

33:15.827 --> 33:18.463
at least make one
of them pretty.

33:19.263 --> 33:20.298
Bye bitch.

33:25.937 --> 33:31.009
(dance music)
(lyrics muffled)

33:42.954 --> 33:45.189
- Lindsay, Rosebud,
remind me again what it is

33:45.189 --> 33:46.624
I pay you two broads for.

33:46.624 --> 33:48.993
Get your asses upstairs
and do your damn jobs.

33:52.296 --> 33:55.833
- You know, at first
I thought Tony did it,

33:55.833 --> 33:57.969
but then I realized he
couldn't have done it.

33:57.969 --> 33:59.470
He doesn't like to drain blood.

33:59.470 --> 34:01.939
It's too much involved,
too much science.

34:01.939 --> 34:04.542
Now Tony, he can
make a cocktail.

34:04.542 --> 34:05.877
- You thought your
own cousin did it?

34:05.877 --> 34:08.246
- You know the kind
of family I'm from.

34:08.246 --> 34:11.748
- I don't know if I
can work here anymore.

34:11.748 --> 34:13.150
- We could be next.

34:16.020 --> 34:16.920
- Tragedi,

34:21.793 --> 34:24.195
what did the body look like?

34:28.533 --> 34:29.434
- Lost.

34:35.172 --> 34:39.077
- So I hear Audrey's
under house arrest.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.844
- Oh girl, not anymore.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.347
- Ooh, let me get a sip of this.

35:02.233 --> 35:03.968
- Hey, Audrey, I gotta
head out of here.

35:03.968 --> 35:05.536
Do you mind closing up for me?

35:06.537 --> 35:07.505
- All right.

35:08.739 --> 35:11.008
- Great, thanks, I'll
see you tomorrow.

35:11.008 --> 35:12.577
- Bye.

35:12.577 --> 35:14.579
I didn't know we
were booked to close.

35:15.980 --> 35:19.283
Hey Tragedi, I'm gonna go
count my tips downstairs.

35:19.283 --> 35:20.184
We're closing.

35:28.392 --> 35:32.363
(in french) Au revoir mon amis.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.001
This ain't even
enough for nails.

35:37.001 --> 35:38.803
People in the city are so cheap.

35:46.244 --> 35:48.613
Jesus fucking Christ, Tragedi,

35:48.613 --> 35:50.248
you scared the shit out of me.

35:51.182 --> 35:53.217
What's that thing on your face?

35:53.217 --> 35:54.452
It's cute though.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.055
I mean, I have to say, Tragedi,

35:58.856 --> 36:00.124
you never looked better.

36:08.332 --> 36:09.600
Lighten up.

36:10.535 --> 36:15.606

37:08.359 --> 37:09.994

37:20.071 --> 37:22.373

37:22.373 --> 37:24.141
Can't be that bad.

37:24.141 --> 37:28.145
- [Dwayne] Being a shot
boy is so degrading.

37:28.145 --> 37:30.681
I can't believe I have to
wear this outfit all night.

Haus' Halloween party

38:10.521 --> 38:13.057
is their biggest of the season.

38:13.057 --> 38:16.093
Plus, I like the theme.

38:16.093 --> 38:19.864
Masquerade balls
are so mysterious.

38:21.198 --> 38:26.170
- About as mysterious as Tony's
last missing three fingers.

38:26.704 --> 38:28.372

38:28.372 --> 38:32.743

so Elphaba and Glinda.

loved by everyone.

38:43.287 --> 38:46.691
So if I'm Elphaba, does that
mean I get to die in the end?

38:46.691 --> 38:51.262

a ruse to trick her enemies.

but she ain't answering.

39:07.878 --> 39:09.847
- I just can't believe you're
letting Gloria fucking Hole

39:09.847 --> 39:11.982
ruin our busiest
night of the year.

39:11.982 --> 39:13.484
- Listen, not for nothing,

39:13.484 --> 39:15.319
but Gloria doesn't have
a whole lot of time left.

39:15.319 --> 39:17.955

a fucking hospice.

worry about my business

39:19.924 --> 39:21.792

doing your little back flips

39:21.792 --> 39:23.661

fuck it is you do.

39:23.661 --> 39:24.929
- Your business?

39:24.929 --> 39:26.964
Let's talk about your business.

39:26.964 --> 39:30.568
You haven't painted these
walls in over a decade.

39:30.568 --> 39:33.637
Your bar smells like a

as everybody else.

54:10.347 --> 54:12.616
He was a gay for pay torso.

54:12.616 --> 54:14.651
- Did he have any enemies?

54:14.651 --> 54:16.886
- He made enemies nightly.

54:16.886 --> 54:18.555
He was a go-go boy.

54:20.090 --> 54:21.691
- That was not helpful.

54:21.691 --> 54:24.928
- Your colleagues tell us
you go by Gloria Troll?

54:26.896 --> 54:28.031
- Yes, detective.

54:29.399 --> 54:34.371
- And what can you tell us
about Miss Audrey Heartburn?

54:36.006 --> 54:37.974
- I can tell you he
shaves his asshole.

54:37.974 --> 54:40.076
- So you to have
a sexual history?

54:40.076 --> 54:44.047
- Oh no, I just know
Tony likes 'em smooth.

54:44.047 --> 54:49.085
- So Tony and her, him,
have a sexual history?

54:50.220 --> 54:52.622
- Let's just assume Tony
and all of his employees

54:52.622 --> 54:54.824
have the sexual history.

54:54.824 --> 54:55.892
I think that he single-handedly

54:55.892 --> 54:58.061
gave the entire city syphilis.

54:58.061 --> 54:59.562
And by single-handedly,

54:59.562 --> 55:03.366
I mean that lobster claw
massacre he calls a limb.

55:04.701 --> 55:08.238
Any more questions, detective?

55:13.877 --> 55:16.613
- Jesus Saint fucking Christ!

55:16.613 --> 55:17.947
Janet, what the fuck?

55:17.947 --> 55:19.783
- People are talking, Tony.

55:19.783 --> 55:22.118
- [Tony] Get the fuck
out of my office.

55:22.118 --> 55:24.187
- Pretty soon you might
not have an office.

55:24.187 --> 55:26.489
Four dead bodies.

55:26.489 --> 55:29.426
You think people
aren't gonna talk?

55:29.426 --> 55:31.127
You bartenders are quitting.

55:31.127 --> 55:33.163
The girls backstage
are petrified.

55:33.163 --> 55:35.832
If you ask me, your
business is clicking

55:35.832 --> 55:38.034
and it's clicking down.

55:40.904 --> 55:42.205
- You've been tucking so long

55:42.205 --> 55:43.606
you're on the fucking rag now.

55:44.674 --> 55:47.310
- I've never done a
split for an empty room

55:47.310 --> 55:50.280
and I'm not about to start now.

55:50.280 --> 55:55.352
- Baby, drag queens like
you are a dime a dozen.

55:56.152 --> 55:57.787
- Keep telling yourself that.

55:57.787 --> 56:00.523
Pretty soon, all
you'll have is dimes.

56:00.523 --> 56:04.861
- Get the fuck out of my office.

56:07.163 --> 56:11.634
- The body count of gay men
continues to rise in Providence

56:11.634 --> 56:14.671
as a dancer who is employed
here at the Aut Haus

56:14.671 --> 56:18.174
was found on Blackstone
Boulevard suspiciously killed.

56:18.174 --> 56:21.578
This gruesome murder could
be the start of a string of-

56:21.578 --> 56:24.247
- I was literally
there last night

56:24.247 --> 56:26.983
and you didn't even warn me?

56:26.983 --> 56:30.253
- Brian, don't be so dramatic.

56:30.253 --> 56:31.855
- Dramatic?

56:31.855 --> 56:35.725
People at your bar are dead
and that could have been me.

56:35.725 --> 56:39.028
Dramatic, what's not
dramatic about that?

56:41.531 --> 56:46.369
Didn't that go-go boy
reject you last week?

56:47.837 --> 56:52.642
- Yes and I killed
him in cold blood.

56:54.811 --> 56:59.416
- Dwayne, I'm serious,
it's fucking scary.

56:59.416 --> 57:00.550
Do you even care?

57:02.018 --> 57:04.454
- Brian, can we please
change the subject?

57:04.454 --> 57:06.890
It's been really stressful
around the bar lately.

57:06.890 --> 57:09.959
Everybody is paranoid and
these detective seem to think

57:09.959 --> 57:11.127
that one of us did it.

57:12.061 --> 57:13.763
- You have a really amazing way

57:13.763 --> 57:16.032
of making things
about you, but yeah,

57:16.032 --> 57:19.002
actually there is something I
wanted to talk to you about.

57:19.803 --> 57:21.304
- All right.

57:23.039 --> 57:25.108
- I'm auditioning
for a new role.

57:25.108 --> 57:26.476
- Congratulations.

57:26.476 --> 57:27.677
- Thank you.

57:27.677 --> 57:31.181
um, it's this weird
like alcoholic,

57:31.181 --> 57:33.349
abrasive has-been character.

57:34.417 --> 57:38.621
I was thinking about
maybe asking Gloria Hole

57:38.621 --> 57:42.692
maybe help me with some
character tips and study.

57:42.692 --> 57:44.527
- What role is this?

57:45.495 --> 57:47.297
- Toll booth attendant two.

57:47.297 --> 57:48.698
(laughing)

57:48.698 --> 57:49.933
Fuck off.

57:50.900 --> 57:53.470
But listen, this one's serious.

57:54.370 --> 57:55.705
- Yes.

57:55.705 --> 57:56.906
- Get a new job.

57:56.906 --> 57:58.441
- Why?

57:58.441 --> 58:01.377
- Because one, I don't
want you murdered.

58:01.377 --> 58:06.449
And B, or two, whatever,
rent's coming up.

58:08.818 --> 58:12.422
Toodles, please don't die.

58:12.422 --> 58:15.658
- The tragic death of a
Beige University student

58:15.658 --> 58:18.127
has struck the community
with a hefty blow.

58:18.127 --> 58:20.864
We spoke with the student's
mother earlier today.

58:20.864 --> 58:25.034
- My son's killer
is still at large.

58:25.034 --> 58:30.106
I cannot sleep, I
will starve myself

58:30.807 --> 58:32.842
until I have answers.

58:32.842 --> 58:37.914
And I will not stop using my
blog until justice is served.

58:41.150 --> 58:43.386
- There has been a total
of four bodies found,

58:43.386 --> 58:44.721
all drained of blood.

58:44.721 --> 58:46.523
One was discovered
in the dumpster

58:46.523 --> 58:49.526
of a now closed Chinese
buffet restaurant.

58:49.526 --> 58:53.329
The other three all seem to
have a connection to this club,

58:53.329 --> 58:56.366
leaving the gay community
to question their safety.

58:56.366 --> 58:58.101
- It's like you can't
even go out anymore

58:58.101 --> 58:59.502
without getting killed.

58:59.502 --> 59:02.705
We didn't just get gay
marriage just to get murdered.

59:03.940 --> 59:07.143
(intense rock music)

59:19.389 --> 59:21.090
- You work at Aut Haus, right?

59:21.090 --> 59:22.625
- Yeah.

59:22.625 --> 59:24.994
- Weird shit happened with
those bodies lately, man.

59:24.994 --> 59:26.462
How's tonight going?

59:29.666 --> 59:31.301
Do you wanna party?

59:37.907 --> 59:40.243
(sniffing)

59:46.716 --> 59:50.353
(screaming lyrics muffled)

59:56.659 --> 59:58.895
(kissing)

01:00:02.665 --> 01:00:04.701
- That's a little rough.

01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:06.336
- Come on, try this.

01:00:06.336 --> 01:00:07.670
- Go easy, man.

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:14.711
(zipper zipping)

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:17.714
(soft piano music)

01:00:27.156 --> 01:00:30.226
(doorbell ringing)

01:00:37.567 --> 01:00:40.970
- Ms. Hole, I don't believe
we've been properly introduced.

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:43.006
My name is Brian O'Hara.

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:44.974
- I'm Catholic.

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:50.313
(door knocking)

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.388
- Thank you.

01:01:00.356 --> 01:01:02.325
I understand your drag.

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:07.230
It's old Hollywood, it's sleepy,
but just a little sleepy.

01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:11.034
It's literally perfect
for my character.

01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:17.073
The thing is, it's the glamor.

01:01:17.073 --> 01:01:18.508
It's the ballads.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:22.211
It's what divas were all about.

01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:25.314
And I mean, it is a
little dated and stuff

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:27.183
but of course, the
thing about drag is-

01:01:27.183 --> 01:01:28.785
- Would you excuse
me for a second.

01:01:28.785 --> 01:01:30.887
I have to go finish
getting ready for Bingo.

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:32.321
- Oh, absolutely.

01:01:32.321 --> 01:01:35.091
I'm gonna sit here,
review my lines,

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:37.593
then when you get back, maybe
we could go a little bit more

01:01:37.593 --> 01:01:39.495
in depth-ly into my character.

01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:34.884
(piano tinkling)

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:43.426
(tense music)

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:25.768
- So listen, you caught
me at a bad time.

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:30.807
I gotta finish this
fruit salad for Bingo.

01:03:38.447 --> 01:03:39.749
- What do you think?

01:03:39.749 --> 01:03:41.083
It's perfect, right?

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:44.754
I've been considering
doing drag for a while now.

01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:48.291
And it's like, I love the stage

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:51.227
and I fucking hate
Janet Fitness.

01:03:51.227 --> 01:03:52.528
That pretty fucking snake.

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:55.498
- Well, we have that
one thing in common.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.334
- Oh my God.

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:00.903
You could be my drag mother.

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:04.574
I could be one of
those singing queens.

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:07.009
I'll need a song.

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:08.845
Something like.

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:13.916
♪ Why don't you dance
to my heartbeat ♪

01:04:15.551 --> 01:04:19.956
♪ It's the only rhythm ♪
that moves my feet ♪

01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:23.693
♪ I remember bitter nights ♪
of cheap frustration ♪

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.628
♪ Undress me with your eyes ♪

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:26.462
What do you think?

01:04:26.462 --> 01:04:27.396
Oh my God!

01:04:27.396 --> 01:04:29.365
I want your honest opinion.

01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:32.835
- Captivating.

01:04:34.237 --> 01:04:37.540
♪ Please love me again ♪

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:40.476
(knife stabbing)

01:04:40.476 --> 01:04:41.844
Bravo, bitch.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.222
(laughing)

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:32.128
(piano plunking)

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:39.135
(door opening)

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:40.036
Fuck.

01:05:41.704 --> 01:05:44.340
(tense music)

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.028
- You old bitch.

01:06:07.697 --> 01:06:10.132
How do you even move so fast?

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:41.864
(alarm beeping)

01:06:51.307 --> 01:06:52.241
- Brian!

01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:56.512
Brian.

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:08.758
Brian.

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:10.693
(door knocking)

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:12.495
Brian, do you have any
more of those Percocets

01:07:12.495 --> 01:07:14.163
for your vocal cord surgery?

01:07:15.998 --> 01:07:16.899
Brian.

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:20.503
Brian?

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:38.454
- Fuck me, I need one more.

01:07:49.598 --> 01:07:51.500
- Hey, I'm sure it'll
be busier tomorrow.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.135
- It God damn better be.

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:06.515
I warned that fat fuck
that when all this got out

01:08:06.515 --> 01:08:08.150
this would happen.

01:08:10.619 --> 01:08:11.754
- I'm gonna take out the trash,

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:13.155
do you need anything
before I go?

01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:14.056
- Who are you?

01:08:18.961 --> 01:08:20.895
- Fucking fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:23.999
There's 20 God damn
people up there

01:08:23.999 --> 01:08:25.734
on a fucking Friday night

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:28.270
all because these
dead fucking losers.

01:08:29.371 --> 01:08:31.607
Oh, get off of me,
I'm not in the mood.

01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:33.542
You only wanna fuck
when I'm angry.

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:37.947
You're not even a pup,
you're a God damn mangy mut.

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:40.249
(growling)

01:08:42.718 --> 01:08:44.687
I'm going to the
bath house to unwind.

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:51.660
Fuck!

01:08:54.063 --> 01:08:55.965
- He's here somewhere.

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:59.768
Come out, come out,
little twinkie.

01:09:02.438 --> 01:09:04.874
Come out and play with mama.

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:12.113
(car crashing) (dog yelp)

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:23.658
(tense music)

01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:29.665
Quick, play dead.

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:34.036
(laughing)

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:39.341
- Are you sure he's just not
somewhere blowing off steam?

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:41.210
- Man, something ain't right.

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:42.411
With everything
going on at the bar,

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:44.113
I think the fucking
vampire got him.

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.814
- Does he have a place he'd go,

01:09:46.814 --> 01:09:49.350
like a friend's or relative's?

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:51.220
- He doesn't have any friends.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:52.787
- What the fuck am
I supposed to do?

01:09:52.787 --> 01:09:55.457
File a missing persons
or call the pound?

01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:59.161
- Wait, Tony, you have
him chipped, don't you?

01:09:59.161 --> 01:10:00.763
- You think that thing
still fucking works?

01:10:00.763 --> 01:10:02.932
- Chipped?

01:10:02.932 --> 01:10:04.934
- Yeah, you got to keep
these pups on a short leash,

01:10:04.934 --> 01:10:06.335
you know what I'm saying?

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:08.938
- Yeah, so call that
company, get the coordinates

01:10:08.938 --> 01:10:10.839
and we'll pick him up
like we did last time

01:10:10.839 --> 01:10:13.375
when he was in front of
that immigration embassy.

01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:19.148
- [Brian] Hi, this is Brian,

01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:22.218
actor, performer,
social influencer.

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:24.153
I'm not available to come
to the phone right now

01:10:24.153 --> 01:10:26.255
but if it's an
emergency, call my agent,

01:10:26.255 --> 01:10:28.924
I'm very available for bookings.

01:10:28.924 --> 01:10:31.327
But you know what to
do after the beep.

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:34.363
- So I called the operator

01:10:34.363 --> 01:10:36.432
and told 'em it was a
missing persons deal.

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:40.169
She rushed the numbers and
then gave me these coordinates.

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:41.337
- So where's the dog?

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:43.939
- In North Providence
on River Street.

01:10:43.939 --> 01:10:46.141
You know who lives on
fucking River Street?

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:47.409
- Who?

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:49.812
- Gloria fucking
Hole, that's who.

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:52.548
- Why would your pup be
with that sad, sad lady man.

01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:54.683
- Fuck do I know, I'm
not here to speculate.

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:58.087
Look, you two bring
me be back my pup

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:00.923
and then bring me that
shriveled potato of a tranny.

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.258
If she's behind all this shit,

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:04.326
and so much laid
a finger on my pup

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:07.696
I don't want that
wigged fruitcake to
see a fucking trial.

01:11:07.696 --> 01:11:08.764
- You got it, T.

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:11.200
- And detectives?

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:15.304
I've had a lot of
boys in my life.

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:17.640
The boys, they come,
the boys, they go,

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:22.711
but you two, you two have
been like fucking sons to me.

01:11:23.379 --> 01:11:24.313
Even you, Blueberry.

01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:27.816
- That's great, Tony,
that was real nice.

01:11:27.816 --> 01:11:30.219
Those are some nice words
you said right there.

01:11:30.219 --> 01:11:32.588
- You could tell that came
straight from the heart.

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:36.292
Now let's go get your
best friend back.

01:11:37.426 --> 01:11:40.763
- Bring me back the pup
regardless of you know.

01:11:40.763 --> 01:11:42.431
- [Detective] Yeah.

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:46.535
(suspenseful music)

01:11:49.905 --> 01:11:50.806
- Was he there?

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:54.009
Something's wrong.

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:56.512
What's wrong?

01:11:56.512 --> 01:11:57.346
You look pale.

01:11:57.346 --> 01:11:58.714
- Nothing's wrong.

01:11:58.714 --> 01:12:00.015
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:05.154
I just, I have a really
weird feeling about tonight.

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:08.090
- Mercury's in retrograde.

01:12:09.091 --> 01:12:11.293
- What's that supposed to mean?

01:12:11.293 --> 01:12:13.595
(groaning)

01:12:41.824 --> 01:12:44.860

01:28:56.864 --> 01:29:00.802
and now all these spoiled,
sorry excuses for stars,

01:29:00.802 --> 01:29:03.037
all they gotta fucking
do is tuck themselves

01:29:03.037 --> 01:29:05.873
one fucking Friday night,
slap on some lipstick

01:29:05.873 --> 01:29:09.577

These little show
puppies of yours

01:29:23.291 --> 01:29:25.660

people are gonna get bored

01:29:27.295 --> 01:29:30.331

Vicki Manaj bullshit

01:29:30.331 --> 01:29:32.266

entertain your club for?

01:29:38.906 --> 01:29:41.509
How long did I keep
the people coming?

01:29:43.745 --> 01:29:46.180
I built that stage
from the ground up

01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:49.050
and you, you,

01:29:50.785 --> 01:29:52.320
you thought that I expired?

01:30:01.262 --> 01:30:06.234

Well, no shit it's shit.

01:30:36.697 --> 01:30:38.332
But I've been just playing
the hand I've been dealt.

01:30:38.332 --> 01:30:40.868
I've been dealt a lot of
shitty hands in my life.

01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:43.104

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:44.572

the way things were.

01:30:50.678 --> 01:30:53.681
You could have your, ya
know, Saturday nights back.

01:30:53.681 --> 01:30:55.149
You could have your
Thursday nights.

01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:57.585
Friday nights, hey,
that's a fucking wild card

01:30:57.585 --> 01:30:59.120
but we could work something out.

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:02.023
- Tony, Tony, Tony,

01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:06.794
what's done is done.

01:31:06.794 --> 01:31:09.063
You've already burnt
this city to the ground.

01:31:09.063 --> 01:31:10.198
- [Tony] Come on, Gloria.

01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:11.432
- [Gloria] No, I'm not finished.

01:31:11.432 --> 01:31:13.167
- [Tony] Get me out
of this fucking chair.

01:31:16.304 --> 01:31:19.440
- Now, I'm just
scattering the ashes.

01:31:21.642 --> 01:31:24.011
- Gloria, Gloria, what
the fuck are you doing?

01:31:24.011 --> 01:31:25.079
Gloria, no.

01:31:25.079 --> 01:31:26.614
Gloria, are you fucking crazy?

01:31:26.614 --> 01:31:28.416
Are you fucking crazy?

01:31:28.416 --> 01:31:29.317
No!

01:31:30.451 --> 01:31:33.287
You crazy fucking bitch!

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:47.568
- Gloria, stop!

01:31:47.568 --> 01:31:49.670
(Gloria screaming)

01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:51.172
- Jesus, what the fuck!

01:31:51.172 --> 01:31:53.975
You scared the living
shit out of me, Tito.

01:31:53.975 --> 01:31:57.979
What, what, you try to, you
trying to save this fucking pig?

01:31:57.979 --> 01:32:01.415
Well, I assume you're
not here for Bingo.

01:32:03.150 --> 01:32:04.685
- You don't have to do this.

01:32:04.685 --> 01:32:06.521
You already got what
you want, look at you.

01:32:06.521 --> 01:32:07.755
You're young, you're beautiful.

01:32:07.755 --> 01:32:08.689
- Thank you.

01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:10.224
- You don't have to do this.

01:32:10.224 --> 01:32:13.427
- What, and waste all this
rejuvenating twink blood?

01:32:13.427 --> 01:32:14.595
I don't think so.

01:32:14.595 --> 01:32:16.464
I believe that you're
out of your tit,

01:32:16.464 --> 01:32:18.866
but do me a favor and do not,

01:32:18.866 --> 01:32:21.936
I repeat, do not
interrupt me again.

01:32:21.936 --> 01:32:25.206
Besides, this is so much
bigger than you, Tito.

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:26.140
- No, no.

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:27.775
- And before he gets away,

01:32:27.775 --> 01:32:30.778
Tuesday nights are
for fucking karaoke!

01:32:30.778 --> 01:32:35.750
(screaming)
(turkey carver grinding)

01:33:03.878 --> 01:33:05.313
Oh, there's more!

01:33:24.565 --> 01:33:25.499
- I knew it!

01:33:25.499 --> 01:33:26.434
I knew all these missing people

01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:28.569
had something to do with this.

01:33:28.569 --> 01:33:30.972
Fuck, Gloria.

01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:32.707
You were respected.

01:33:32.707 --> 01:33:35.142
People worshiped you,
they cared about you.

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:37.945
My friend Brian
looked up to you.

01:33:39.246 --> 01:33:40.615
- Brian?

01:33:40.615 --> 01:33:43.384
Wait, you mean the
off-Broadway atrocity?

01:33:43.384 --> 01:33:45.786
Please, I did Providence
Community Theater a favor

01:33:45.786 --> 01:33:47.989
by offing that one.

01:33:49.657 --> 01:33:51.525
- You killed Brian?

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:55.763
- Oh, oh, oh, you killed Brian?

01:33:55.763 --> 01:33:57.465
Yes, I did in fact,

01:33:57.465 --> 01:34:00.134
the only sad part was that
he ruined my favorite kimono.

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:05.139
- Fucking bitch!

01:34:05.139 --> 01:34:07.441
(gasping)

01:34:10.177 --> 01:34:12.213
- You know what I
liked about you, Tito?

01:34:12.213 --> 01:34:14.048
'Cause you knew how
to pour a good drink

01:34:14.048 --> 01:34:16.884
and you usually knew
when to shut the fuck up.

01:34:16.884 --> 01:34:19.553
You wanna kiss his ass so
bad, why don't you eat it?

01:34:24.725 --> 01:34:25.893
Open up, big boy.

01:34:27.662 --> 01:34:30.231
(tense music)

01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:02.763
(soft music)

01:35:21.716 --> 01:35:22.616
Hi, Mom.

01:35:23.884 --> 01:35:26.387
You were loved and
admired by a lot of people

01:35:27.688 --> 01:35:30.024
and you had a lot of men shave
their balls just for you.

01:35:32.526 --> 01:35:33.894
I'm so glad you're dead.

01:35:45.039 --> 01:35:47.274
(glass breaking)

01:35:47.274 --> 01:35:52.346
Oh, Tito, how cute, you missed.

01:35:58.419 --> 01:35:59.820
- Fucking whore!

01:36:03.057 --> 01:36:05.359
(punching)

01:36:14.368 --> 01:36:17.171
(glass breaking)

01:37:23.904 --> 01:37:25.072
- Bottoms up.

01:37:45.559 --> 01:37:47.194
You fucking kidding me?

01:37:55.369 --> 01:37:57.771
MA!

01:38:42.016 --> 01:38:43.250
- Up your ass.

01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:52.860
Fuck, Tito!

01:39:24.191 --> 01:39:28.495
It looks like your career's
not the only thing that's dead.

01:39:28.495 --> 01:39:29.797
- Do me a favor

01:39:32.499 --> 01:39:36.337
and tell 'em Gloria said
to go fuck themselves!

01:39:38.906 --> 01:39:40.741
- You're a fucking monster.

01:39:43.143 --> 01:39:44.244
- So was Tony.

01:39:47.147 --> 01:39:48.048
So was Janet.

01:39:50.417 --> 01:39:54.221
And I bet deep down inside,

01:39:56.223 --> 01:39:58.525
you are too.

01:40:00.894 --> 01:40:05.332
Now finish the God damn number!

01:40:08.635 --> 01:40:11.205
(tense music)

01:40:38.832 --> 01:40:41.468
(upbeat music)

01:40:45.172 --> 01:40:49.576
- So boss, do think
anyone will actually come?

01:40:50.978 --> 01:40:53.213
This place hasn't seen a
customer since that night.

01:41:01.388 --> 01:41:03.590

tiny, grimy, piece of shit city.

01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:40.561
You don't need that.

01:41:41.829 --> 01:41:44.932

shot right up here.

01:41:47.668 --> 01:41:48.869

Me and you forever on the
lam, looking gorgeous?

01:41:59.213 --> 01:42:02.282
- Well, we will need
more blood eventually.

01:42:07.221 --> 01:42:09.590
- I'm gonna need a
fucking cigarette.

01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:12.493
- Just think of the
kills as maintenance.

01:42:13.927 --> 01:42:15.395

Do I look like I
was done with that?

01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:27.401
It's over.

01:43:28.602 --> 01:43:33.073
It's over, after 30 years.

01:43:34.241 --> 01:43:35.409
It's finally over.

01:43:36.476 --> 01:43:37.678
It's time to untuck.
