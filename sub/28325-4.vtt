00:50.008 --> 00:51.764
Hey, lady.

00:52.224 --> 00:53.666
It's been a while.

00:53.794 --> 00:57.079
Oh. Ooh.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.728
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:02.765 --> 01:05.114
- Name's Jean.
- I know who you are.

01:14.423 --> 01:17.325
Holy shit.

01:17.660 --> 01:18.935
Oh.

01:25.411 --> 01:29.187
Norm, honey, I'm a lesbian.

01:29.631 --> 01:32.464
And you're what they call asexual.

01:34.288 --> 01:35.438
Yeah?

01:37.161 --> 01:38.591
Right, so, um...

01:40.424 --> 01:42.523
I want Sam to move in with me.

01:42.560 --> 01:46.629
Well, us, really, because
I don't want you to move out.

01:46.781 --> 01:48.606
We'd like you to live at the house.

01:48.701 --> 01:51.183
That is, if you're willing to accept

01:51.220 --> 01:52.991
that Sam and I are now together.

01:55.531 --> 01:56.846
Yep.

01:58.796 --> 02:00.554
Hey, hey. What's the matter?

02:00.591 --> 02:03.871
Well, all my dreams are coming true.

02:04.007 --> 02:07.201
Oh. Yeah.

02:09.145 --> 02:11.435
I figure I'll put you guys
in the spare room,

02:11.472 --> 02:13.656
and, uh, Norm can sleep
out on the couch.

02:14.152 --> 02:15.669
Uh, he's sleeping with me.

02:15.706 --> 02:17.018
Wow, really?

02:17.055 --> 02:19.719
I had no idea you guys
were such libertines.

02:19.756 --> 02:23.350
No, Sam'll be in with Norm
because of my snoring.

02:23.484 --> 02:25.725
If I've gone this long
without a penis inside me,

02:25.762 --> 02:28.171
I don't think Norm's
is gonna break the streak.

02:32.603 --> 02:35.253
So I'm glad you invited us out.

02:35.315 --> 02:37.772
It gives me an excuse to visit
this part of the country.

02:37.849 --> 02:39.961
I love it here, so I assume you hate it

02:39.998 --> 02:41.256
for some reason.

02:41.340 --> 02:43.674
Yeah, Jean, central Florida
was once nothing

02:43.723 --> 02:46.439
but swamp land, mosquitoes,
and the last remnants

02:46.476 --> 02:48.552
of a decimated Seminole tribe.

02:48.701 --> 02:50.025
Back in the 1920s,

02:50.086 --> 02:53.120
in order to lure tourists
away from the beaches,

02:53.157 --> 02:54.880
the local hucksters began building

02:54.917 --> 02:56.680
a lot of places of low character

02:56.717 --> 03:00.194
like, uh, greyhound dog tracks
and live mermaid shows

03:00.231 --> 03:03.899
and alligator farms,
initiating the rube stampede

03:03.936 --> 03:06.178
to this incubator of butt sweat,

03:06.215 --> 03:08.141
continuing into the turbulent '60s,

03:08.178 --> 03:10.878
all culminating in 1971

03:10.915 --> 03:12.894
when the greatest huckster
of them all...

03:12.931 --> 03:15.647
Mr. Walt Disney... decided to play God

03:15.684 --> 03:18.777
with his... his simulacrum
of G-rated Babylon.

03:18.965 --> 03:22.800
And that is when the millions
upon millions of folks started

03:22.940 --> 03:26.292
flocking to this rancid cum gutter.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.403
We're going to Disney World
on Thursday.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.159
Don't worry.
We didn't get you a ticket.

03:31.196 --> 03:34.372
But I did get you something
for paying for my surgery.

03:34.506 --> 03:37.037
Oh, Jean, you should have,

03:37.074 --> 03:38.371
'cause that shit was

03:38.408 --> 03:40.785
way more expensive than I
thought it was gonna be.

03:40.822 --> 03:43.173
What have you always dreamed of?

03:43.254 --> 03:44.849
Pleasuring myself orally.

03:44.886 --> 03:46.869
No, I'm just gonna cut to the chase.

03:46.948 --> 03:48.643
I have reconnected with Mom.

03:48.680 --> 03:50.623
We're having lunch with her tomorrow.

03:52.092 --> 03:53.168
Our mom?

03:53.205 --> 03:55.892
How, uh... how the hell
did you find her?

03:55.969 --> 03:57.852
I'm getting really good at Facebook.

03:57.889 --> 04:00.073
I finally tracked her down
by putting in her name.

04:00.391 --> 04:02.430
She was so excited to hear from me.

04:02.467 --> 04:04.105
She wants to see both of us.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.124
Jean, Lorraine abandoned

04:06.161 --> 04:07.680
the both of us when we were children.

04:07.717 --> 04:09.840
I mean, you sure you wan
to invite somebody like that

04:09.877 --> 04:11.969
back into your life? 'Cause I do not.

04:12.006 --> 04:15.158
If my relationship with Sam
has taught me anything,

04:15.326 --> 04:18.692
it's that you have to take
risks to find happiness.

04:18.778 --> 04:22.181
I mean, sure, it might be
scary, but it's so worth it.

04:22.337 --> 04:24.346
All right, well, I-I'll do it for you.

04:24.383 --> 04:25.933
But definitely not for her.

04:29.377 --> 04:31.903
You know, two years ago

04:31.940 --> 04:33.503
if you'd told me I would be excited

04:33.540 --> 04:37.844
to visit my brother with my
"throuple" and my new vagina...

04:38.228 --> 04:41.380
the most surprising part
would be wanting to see you.

04:41.497 --> 04:43.572
Oh, well, thank you, Jean.

04:43.733 --> 04:46.234
I have a few thoughts of my own
about the current moment.

04:46.271 --> 04:48.251
Yeah, no. Don't know, don't care.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.955
Me and Sam are gonna go have sex.

04:49.992 --> 04:51.677
- Oh.
- Come on, baby.

04:51.722 --> 04:54.087
Time to ride the jelly wagon.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.287
Okay.

04:58.129 --> 05:01.060
I guess I just wasn't cut out
to be a wife...

05:01.236 --> 05:03.453
or a mother.

05:03.752 --> 05:06.202
And your father certainly never
made it easier for me...

05:06.239 --> 05:08.462
But I never
should have left you with him.

05:08.679 --> 05:12.505
I... I'll never, ever
forgive myself for that.

05:13.184 --> 05:16.365
We all make mistakes, Mom.

05:16.433 --> 05:18.418
I know I've made my share.

05:18.903 --> 05:22.155
Jim, you certainly have
your regrets, right?

05:22.263 --> 05:23.653
Oh, my goodness.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.417
I mean, I once blacked out and woke up

05:25.454 --> 05:27.131
dancing at a Steely Dan concert.

05:27.168 --> 05:29.325
No, no, that one...
that one returns to me

05:29.362 --> 05:30.694
in my darkest moments.

05:30.873 --> 05:33.437
Gee, Mom, shouldn't you
be hitting the road?

05:33.474 --> 05:35.639
Very long drive back to Valdosta.

05:35.788 --> 05:38.589
No, I've got me a room
at the Red Roof Inn.

05:38.738 --> 05:41.906
You know where the 92 meets the 570?

05:42.163 --> 05:45.439
- Oh, God, this is hot.
- Oh, here.

05:45.535 --> 05:47.152
Let me help you.

05:47.544 --> 05:49.785
Oh, you sweet girl.

05:49.949 --> 05:51.809
I have got to tinkle.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.710
Another thing that's fun again,
thanks to you.

05:54.756 --> 05:57.046
All my dreams are coming true.

06:03.732 --> 06:05.049
All right, you can cut the shit.

06:05.086 --> 06:06.516
Oh, come on, Jimmy.

06:06.553 --> 06:09.248
Ain't you happy to see
your long-lost mama?

06:09.294 --> 06:10.988
I thought we had an agreement

06:11.080 --> 06:12.728
that you would stay away from Jean.

06:12.826 --> 06:16.267
God, she's about as dull
as a butter knife.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.742
"Tinkle"? Jesus Christ.

06:18.978 --> 06:20.787
Yeah, she doesn't know about us, okay?

06:20.965 --> 06:24.133
God damn it, I'm just... I'm
trying not to screw up anymore.

06:24.170 --> 06:25.965
Oh, well, good luck with that.

06:26.002 --> 06:27.260
- Can I top you off?
- No.

06:27.297 --> 06:29.081
- Hey, I'm sober now.
- Oh.

06:31.976 --> 06:35.009
- Actually been 14 months.
- Oh.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.051
So you think it's gonna last.

06:37.088 --> 06:39.104
Well, that makes it even better.

06:44.527 --> 06:46.202
Can we just get to it, please?

06:46.239 --> 06:48.680
- What's the angle?
- Smart boy.

06:48.717 --> 06:50.125
I need a favor.

06:50.755 --> 06:52.768
Oh, what do the Russians want now?

06:52.846 --> 06:54.371
Oh, I don't work for them anymore.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.581
They have a terrible ageism problem.

06:56.697 --> 06:58.604
Yeah, and you can't exactly call HR

06:58.641 --> 07:00.644
on Sergei the Face Slasher,

07:00.778 --> 07:03.446
which is a weird name for him
because he just shot everyone

07:03.523 --> 07:05.296
and not necessarily in the face.

07:05.333 --> 07:06.405
Don't care.

07:06.442 --> 07:07.756
Yeah, and I may be getting older.

07:07.793 --> 07:09.533
But let's face it.

07:09.570 --> 07:11.236
I'm keeping it tight for my age.

07:11.281 --> 07:13.948
Yeah, when I throw a fuck at someone,

07:13.985 --> 07:15.427
it don't hit the floor.

07:15.464 --> 07:16.669
Jesus, Mom.

07:16.706 --> 07:18.598
I'm working for the Armenians now.

07:18.724 --> 07:21.716
Now, that's a group who has
real respect for their elders.

07:21.859 --> 07:23.926
Must come from surviving the holocaust

07:23.963 --> 07:25.278
'cause the Jews have it, too.

07:25.315 --> 07:26.670
Jesus Chri... You're exhausting.

07:26.707 --> 07:27.764
Do you know that?

07:27.801 --> 07:30.469
Everything is a digression
wrapped in a tangent.

07:30.808 --> 07:32.539
Holy shit. I get that from you.

07:32.576 --> 07:34.302
Here's the play.

07:34.613 --> 07:36.571
With legalized sports betting,

07:36.648 --> 07:38.573
there's a flood
of dumb money coming in,

07:38.650 --> 07:40.834
which will push
the lines all over the place.

07:40.985 --> 07:44.915
A smart person with inside
information can make a killing.

07:45.013 --> 07:47.240
Ma, I'm gonna stop you right
there, okay? 'Cause I'm out.

07:47.397 --> 07:51.151
No, the only thing you can't do
in baseball is bet on baseball.

07:51.335 --> 07:53.778
Hall of Fame is filled
with cheaters and racists

07:53.815 --> 07:55.924
and wife beaters,
but not one human being

07:56.000 --> 07:57.350
who ever gambled on the game.

07:57.462 --> 07:59.053
You don't have to do anything.

07:59.170 --> 08:01.490
Just get your sweet little old
mother into the locker room

08:01.527 --> 08:03.466
so she can ask a few questions.

08:03.601 --> 08:06.425
I've got a kid at MIT
who's running the analytics.

08:06.515 --> 08:08.023
The Armenians are the bank.

08:08.076 --> 08:10.401
You wet your beak. Everybody wins.

08:10.455 --> 08:12.389
No, the money's not the issue, okay?

08:12.480 --> 08:15.014
It's the whole "getting banned
from baseball" aspect

08:15.051 --> 08:16.450
that is slowing my roll here.

08:16.487 --> 08:20.672
Hey, I did you a favor.
I'm calling in my marker.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.117
You know, I think time might
have inflated the magnitude

08:23.154 --> 08:24.309
of this favor in your mind.

08:24.346 --> 08:26.368
Yeah, you got me a job
calling cockfights.

08:26.405 --> 08:28.472
You didn't tell me I'd have
to bury the loser.

08:28.651 --> 08:30.943
'Cause that shit... that takes its...

08:31.038 --> 08:32.368
takes its toll.

08:32.421 --> 08:34.361
Okay, have it your way.

08:34.924 --> 08:36.438
Oh, by the way,

08:36.558 --> 08:38.725
you should be the one
who tells your sister

08:38.876 --> 08:40.894
about the secret relationship
you've had

08:40.957 --> 08:43.366
with the mother she's been
craving all these years,

08:43.525 --> 08:46.342
'cause if I have to do it, I'm
gonna be real mean about it.

08:46.427 --> 08:48.878
Well, you are one vicious
and brutal cun...

08:48.915 --> 08:50.153
fusing menu.

08:50.190 --> 08:51.519
I mean, there's a whole page

08:51.556 --> 08:52.963
of specials in here.
I don't even see it.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.440
So where are we headed to next?

08:55.727 --> 08:59.312
Um, you know, Mom wanted
to see where I work.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.304
So we're gonna do
a little mother-son trip

09:01.341 --> 09:03.042
out to the ball park,
if you don't mind.

09:03.079 --> 09:06.254
Mind? This is what I wanted for you.

09:06.396 --> 09:07.940
I couldn't have pictured

09:07.977 --> 09:09.692
this day going any better.

09:09.788 --> 09:12.408
Me either.

09:16.740 --> 09:18.848
Uh, hey, everybody.

09:18.950 --> 09:20.648
I want to introduce you to my mom...

09:20.685 --> 09:23.186
Mrs. Lorraine Brockmire.

09:27.995 --> 09:30.186
- Mom...
- Well, this is first time

09:30.223 --> 09:33.048
that I've been to a baseball stadium

09:33.152 --> 09:35.433
since Jim's father passed away.

09:36.901 --> 09:39.426
I didn't really care much for the game,

09:39.463 --> 09:41.295
when I was younger.

09:41.462 --> 09:43.606
I had to learn it from Jim Senior

09:43.625 --> 09:45.683
when he was teaching little Jimmy.

09:45.702 --> 09:49.294
I would overhear them playing catch,

09:49.445 --> 09:50.999
you know, every night,

09:51.036 --> 09:54.170
outside my open kitchen window.

09:54.689 --> 09:56.259
It's been...

09:57.403 --> 10:01.290
It's been hard for me
to watch it alone, you know?

10:01.367 --> 10:02.642
I'm so sorry.

10:02.679 --> 10:05.197
Look at me...
just carrying on like this.

10:05.234 --> 10:07.676
- Please forgive me.
- Jesus Christ.

10:07.713 --> 10:09.379
No, hey. It's... It's fine.

10:09.801 --> 10:13.162
Ma'am, it's fine.
I'm uh... I'm Lance...

10:13.474 --> 10:16.193
- Kuchar.
- I know who you are, Kooch.

10:16.230 --> 10:18.325
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:18.362 --> 10:21.029
It's so good to meet...
God, what a grip.

10:21.585 --> 10:25.389
Oh, it feels like that's a
blister on your pitching hand.

10:25.516 --> 10:27.909
How often do you get these?

10:28.363 --> 10:30.196
How would you like to meet
the other guys?

10:30.402 --> 10:32.248
More than I can say.

10:32.324 --> 10:34.349
All right, let's see
what I can do here.

10:34.638 --> 10:37.429
Carlos, this is Lorraine, Jim's mom.

10:40.355 --> 10:41.929
She's divorcing me....

10:43.590 --> 10:48.882
Because she found texts from some girl

10:49.009 --> 10:50.915
that I barely even cheated with.

10:51.257 --> 10:53.948
- Oh, you poor thing.
- I can't eat.

10:53.985 --> 10:56.653
I can't sleep. I'm freaking out.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.790
My agent's got me booked
with some therapist next week.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.944
Oh, don't see a therapist.

11:03.146 --> 11:06.228
They put these awful thoughts
in your head.

11:06.377 --> 11:10.572
You stuff this all down. Numb yourself.

11:10.945 --> 11:12.845
They don't drug-test for alcohol.

11:12.882 --> 11:14.203
Okay, Mom.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.574
We... we bothered these nice
gentlemen for long enough.

11:16.613 --> 11:18.682
It's time for us to go.

11:19.537 --> 11:21.350
Thank you, Kooch.

11:22.114 --> 11:23.297
See you, fellas.

11:23.374 --> 11:24.810
Come on, Mom.

11:24.945 --> 11:26.801
Well, my work is done here.

11:26.838 --> 11:28.521
Kooch is ripe for a mental breakdown.

11:28.558 --> 11:31.576
- Shh.
- Well, I have "Incepted" him.

11:31.779 --> 11:34.964
Oh, you would like
that movie, you monster.

11:35.219 --> 11:38.884
So next weekend I'll head up
to Lakeland with you.

11:38.921 --> 11:40.478
Oh, no, no, no, next weekend.

11:40.515 --> 11:42.162
You got what you wanted. Now just...

11:42.199 --> 11:43.698
leave us alone. We're done.

11:43.735 --> 11:46.117
Listen, you don't kill the golden goose

11:46.154 --> 11:48.156
just as it's starting to lay eggs.

11:48.293 --> 11:50.920
You help me out with this,
I'll continue to play

11:50.957 --> 11:53.207
the doting mother to Jean

11:53.316 --> 11:54.894
until she dies...

11:54.939 --> 11:57.259
because she's definitely
going before me.

11:57.296 --> 11:59.037
Have you seen how she eats?

11:59.171 --> 12:01.644
Who orders loaded tots for brunch?

12:01.856 --> 12:03.337
This is extortion.

12:03.414 --> 12:05.281
Nobody's breaking any legs.

12:05.444 --> 12:07.999
It's a little emotional
violence, that's all.

12:08.064 --> 12:09.682
It's family, you know.

12:19.672 --> 12:21.212
Hey.

12:22.174 --> 12:26.194
Boy, you weren't kidding
about her snoring.

12:26.345 --> 12:28.177
- That shit is deafening.
- Hmm.

12:28.214 --> 12:29.622
And evocative.

12:29.699 --> 12:31.745
I always picture a slaughterhouse

12:31.782 --> 12:33.201
for wild animals.

12:34.737 --> 12:37.083
Well, I probably couldn't
have slept much, anyway.

12:37.473 --> 12:39.214
Been a weird day.

12:39.374 --> 12:40.799
I can only imagine.

12:40.969 --> 12:44.446
Must be life-altering to see
your mom after 50 years.

12:44.483 --> 12:45.714
Is it life-altering?

12:45.751 --> 12:47.918
I mean, no, she's basically a stranger.

12:48.015 --> 12:49.705
If she were to disappear tomorrow,

12:49.742 --> 12:51.482
due to a disagreement with, say,

12:51.519 --> 12:52.788
a powerful Armenian man,

12:52.825 --> 12:54.200
who'd really care?

12:54.359 --> 12:57.327
Jean would. That's who.

12:57.589 --> 13:00.664
Look, this is a-a huge deal for her.

13:01.196 --> 13:03.031
You know... The first time

13:03.068 --> 13:04.796
I made her come so hard, she cried...

13:04.833 --> 13:07.109
Whoa, the first time?

13:07.570 --> 13:09.996
That implies this was
a frequent occurrence.

13:10.238 --> 13:12.903
Hey, when you got five
good friends like this,

13:13.021 --> 13:14.126
you betcha.

13:14.163 --> 13:15.514
Okay.

13:16.241 --> 13:18.483
Oh, lesbians are the goddamn best.

13:18.520 --> 13:19.813
Anyway, I'm sorry.

13:19.850 --> 13:21.273
You made her come so hard, she cried.

13:21.310 --> 13:22.509
Please continue.

13:22.546 --> 13:25.402
Yeah, well,
and in that emotional space,

13:25.870 --> 13:27.997
she talked a lot about your mother...

13:28.148 --> 13:31.210
how she'd never gotten
over being abandoned...

13:31.983 --> 13:36.481
that she's always felt broken
and unlovable.

13:39.004 --> 13:41.925
And then Norm and I just held her.

13:43.316 --> 13:44.816
Norm was there?

13:44.853 --> 13:46.904
We sleep in the same room.

13:46.972 --> 13:49.823
Twin beds. He mostly reads.

13:50.225 --> 13:51.545
Well, you're definitely the best thing

13:51.581 --> 13:52.893
that's ever happened to my sister.

13:52.930 --> 13:56.165
Seriously,
I have never seen her so happy.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.902
You know, she told me
that when you're living a lie,

14:00.148 --> 14:02.409
even the happy moments are sad,

14:02.446 --> 14:07.387
because deep down,
you know it's bullshit.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.458
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to say.

14:13.521 --> 14:16.645
I'm going to Disney World.

14:19.563 --> 14:22.949
It is not hyperbole to say
that that was my Vietnam.

14:23.296 --> 14:26.406
When I close my eyes,
I can still hear the screams.

14:26.482 --> 14:29.530
- Of happy children?
- Yeah, you hear them, too?

14:29.744 --> 14:31.319
I'm still glad you came.

14:31.356 --> 14:33.926
We got our first picture
together in 20 years.

14:34.065 --> 14:36.102
Can't wait to go to Kinko's
and have somebody explain

14:36.139 --> 14:38.666
how to put it on Facebook
so Mom can see it.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.754
Jean, that's kind of why
I wanted to walk with you.

14:41.970 --> 14:45.173
Um, you know how Mom seems like

14:45.210 --> 14:47.046
this sweet little old lady?

14:47.168 --> 14:51.336
Well, in actuality, uh...

14:51.490 --> 14:53.996
Mom was this
cutthroat Mafia foot soldier

14:54.033 --> 14:56.425
who spent most of our lives
working in organized crime.

14:56.495 --> 14:58.771
I don't understand.

14:58.923 --> 15:00.433
Yeah, I should probably back up.

15:00.470 --> 15:03.414
Uh, at one point
in our nation's history,

15:03.519 --> 15:06.163
Kansas City actually had
the most powerful Mafia.

15:06.264 --> 15:09.658
Its geographical isolation
allowed it to consolidate power

15:09.695 --> 15:11.770
and to avoid the infighting
that characterized

15:11.807 --> 15:13.416
the New York and Chicago underworld.

15:13.453 --> 15:14.783
You're pulling my leg. I'm supposed

15:14.820 --> 15:15.991
to believe that our mother...

15:16.036 --> 15:18.735
that sweet little old lady
in the Anne Murray shirt...

15:18.805 --> 15:20.788
is some mobster who killed people?

15:20.853 --> 15:22.355
Well, she wasn't a button man, no.

15:22.392 --> 15:25.031
Now, did she act as a honey pot
to lure unsuspecting me

15:25.068 --> 15:28.034
into secluded locations
to be shot by her coworkers?

15:28.137 --> 15:30.566
- Almost definitely.
- I mean, you're serious?

15:30.632 --> 15:31.907
Yeah, I'm serious.

15:31.944 --> 15:33.640
We haven't seen her since we were kids.

15:33.677 --> 15:35.409
How would you know any of this?

15:35.485 --> 15:37.375
All right, Jean, I'm gonna
tell you something else.

15:37.412 --> 15:39.485
And when I do,
I want you to keep in mind

15:39.522 --> 15:41.189
that we weren't close
for a very long time,

15:41.226 --> 15:42.831
and I'm a much better person now,

15:42.868 --> 15:44.364
who just spent the last seven hours

15:44.401 --> 15:46.309
waiting on very long lines with you

15:46.346 --> 15:49.290
for fake experiences and $12 churros.

15:49.517 --> 15:51.234
How do you know?

15:51.359 --> 15:54.034
Jean, Mom came back into my
life when I was 18 years old.

15:54.071 --> 15:56.429
She offered to pay for my college,

15:56.561 --> 15:58.278
if I kept it from you.

15:58.574 --> 15:59.740
I thought you had

15:59.797 --> 16:01.906
a Division-I broadcast scholarship.

16:02.300 --> 16:04.851
Yeah, that's not a thing
that actually exists, Jean.

16:04.996 --> 16:08.265
So this whole time... you knew her?

16:08.302 --> 16:09.634
You got to have a mother?

16:09.671 --> 16:11.354
Well, now, Jean, I would not say that.

16:11.420 --> 16:13.357
No, there's not
a maternal bone in her body.

16:13.394 --> 16:15.136
Most of the time we met up
at underground casinos

16:15.173 --> 16:16.376
and dog tracks.

16:16.413 --> 16:18.540
Jean, I once saw her shoot a greyhound

16:18.577 --> 16:20.049
as a lesson to the other greyhounds.

16:20.086 --> 16:21.401
Oh, Jean, are you crying?

16:21.438 --> 16:24.093
You wouldn't by any chance just
be having an orgasm, would you?

16:24.130 --> 16:27.593
Jim, why didn't she want to know me?

16:27.664 --> 16:30.173
Oh, you know, who can say?

16:30.317 --> 16:32.133
You, you can say,

16:32.170 --> 16:33.581
because you know everything about her.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.371
You've known everything
about her all along.

16:35.408 --> 16:36.957
This is not a door
you want to knock on.

16:36.994 --> 16:38.678
Open the fucking door!

16:38.884 --> 16:40.175
All right.

16:40.212 --> 16:41.612
Mom doesn't respect you, okay?

16:41.649 --> 16:43.749
When she looks at you,
she sees the daughter

16:43.786 --> 16:45.398
of a man who drove a bread truck.

16:45.573 --> 16:47.880
Look, I should have told you.
I was trying to protect you.

16:47.917 --> 16:50.101
I'm so sorry.
I mean, you're tough as nails.

16:50.138 --> 16:51.718
You do not see the angles, Jean.

16:51.755 --> 16:53.249
Mom would have played you
like a fiddle.

16:53.286 --> 16:55.038
She would have. In fact, she just did.

16:55.075 --> 16:56.975
You were always a terrible brother.

16:57.116 --> 16:58.433
Always thought you were smarter.

16:58.470 --> 17:00.465
Never even pretended to like Norm.

17:00.502 --> 17:02.235
But I always tried to move past it

17:02.272 --> 17:03.840
because you were the only family I had.

17:03.877 --> 17:05.510
But now I know I have no family.

17:05.690 --> 17:07.555
I was raised in a nest of vipers.

17:07.592 --> 17:08.748
Just... here.

17:08.785 --> 17:11.506
You keep that as a memory
of the last time you saw me.

17:11.906 --> 17:14.430
Thanks for saving me
the trip the Kinko's!

17:14.632 --> 17:17.281
Now, Jean, come on.
You don't mean that, Jean.

17:17.412 --> 17:20.011
Jean, look, you can scan this
kind of thing on your phone.

17:20.048 --> 17:22.924
There's literally no reason
to ever set foot in a Kinko's!

17:23.003 --> 17:24.429
Jean?

17:24.827 --> 17:27.152
Did you hear what I said about Kinko's?

17:42.892 --> 17:44.026
Oh, God damn.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.400
You... you turned little Joaquin?

17:46.437 --> 17:47.546
Kid's a player.

17:47.583 --> 17:49.342
He chiseled me out of a percentage.

17:49.461 --> 17:51.235
You look like you could use a drink.

17:53.061 --> 17:55.395
- I told Jean.
- Oh, I know.

17:55.698 --> 17:58.859
She flamed me last night
on my fake Facebook page.

17:59.011 --> 18:01.206
My fake friends were horrified.

18:01.340 --> 18:03.456
Uh, you and me are done, okay?

18:03.493 --> 18:04.839
I mean forever.

18:04.910 --> 18:07.520
So you would throw away
millions of dollars for Jean?

18:07.557 --> 18:10.392
- Yeah.
- Jean doesn't matter.

18:10.429 --> 18:11.762
Nothing matters.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.383
You always say that.
Can I tell you something?

18:13.420 --> 18:15.018
It's real bullshit. You know why?

18:15.076 --> 18:16.501
Everything matters.

18:16.712 --> 18:19.022
It matters that you left us
when we were kids.

18:19.059 --> 18:22.591
It matters that Dad
was an alcoholic piece of shit.

18:22.713 --> 18:25.303
And it matters that Jean tried
to protect me from him.

18:25.340 --> 18:27.881
You just let all this stuff
live in your head, don't you?

18:27.982 --> 18:29.315
No wonder you got the yips.

18:29.362 --> 18:30.888
Oh, not talking about that with you.

18:30.925 --> 18:33.551
I mean, really. Jesus, there
are only nine possible counts.

18:33.588 --> 18:35.428
You think you would have gotten
one of them by accident.

18:35.464 --> 18:37.534
Okay.

18:37.571 --> 18:40.384
You'll be a lot better when
this morality phase is over.

18:40.421 --> 18:42.329
It's not a phase. I'm changing.

18:42.375 --> 18:43.677
Oh, yeah? No, you're not.

18:43.714 --> 18:44.839
- No, I am.
- No, you're not.

18:44.876 --> 18:46.004
- Yes, I am.
- Listen,

18:46.041 --> 18:47.782
I know your dirty little secret, honey.

18:47.819 --> 18:48.927
Oh, what's that?

18:49.261 --> 18:50.969
You like that I picked you,

18:51.152 --> 18:54.152
'cause it meant that you
weren't ordinary like her.

18:55.094 --> 18:56.710
We're special, you and I.

18:56.747 --> 19:00.142
That's why all these idiots
will always be our pawns.

19:00.675 --> 19:04.464
Listen, I was put
on this earth to raise hell.

19:04.687 --> 19:07.428
And that very same blood
is running through your veins.

19:07.786 --> 19:10.608
So why don't you just stop
pretending to be nice?

19:10.946 --> 19:12.837
Enjoy yourself.

19:13.085 --> 19:15.791
And for God sakes, honey,
stay out of the sun.

19:15.828 --> 19:17.437
Your eyes look like two assholes

19:17.474 --> 19:19.427
floating in tomato soup.

19:33.569 --> 19:36.162
<i>Hey, uh, I really need to talk to you.</i>

19:36.791 --> 19:39.067
Oh, boy.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.394
Caught the first flight down.

19:56.204 --> 19:58.328
- Wow.
- Yeah.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.333
I have one question.

20:00.426 --> 20:02.851
Who told you to admit
the truth to Jean?

20:03.056 --> 20:04.169
Nobody. I just did it.

20:04.206 --> 20:05.240
Should I not have?

20:05.277 --> 20:07.184
I mean, I-I just couldn't
stand to see Lorraine

20:07.221 --> 20:09.375
smiling right into her face
and laughing at her

20:09.412 --> 20:11.578
behind her back...
I had to tell Jean, even...

20:11.624 --> 20:14.460
Even if it meant losing her.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.800
Jim...

20:17.185 --> 20:18.684
that's amazing.

20:18.721 --> 20:20.650
I had no idea you were doing this well.

20:20.837 --> 20:22.078
Doing well?

20:22.115 --> 20:23.820
I just lost the only
family I had left...

20:23.857 --> 20:26.356
I mean, apart from Clemenza.

20:27.555 --> 20:30.848
He's my 100-year-old pet tortoise.

20:32.204 --> 20:34.555
You're just gonna keep on
getting weirder and weirder

20:34.592 --> 20:35.932
the older you get, huh?

20:35.969 --> 20:38.153
It is looking that way, yeah.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.905
I mean, this is the first unselfish act

20:41.942 --> 20:43.399
you've done since I've known you.

20:43.436 --> 20:46.773
Yeah, well, so far, becoming
a good person feels a whole lot

20:46.810 --> 20:50.329
like I open wide and the entire
world shits in my mouth.

20:50.608 --> 20:53.108
Yep, that's pretty much it.

20:53.302 --> 20:55.919
This world does not reward kindness.

20:56.376 --> 20:58.727
Then what is the point?

20:59.910 --> 21:01.525
Being a good person is the best way

21:01.562 --> 21:03.083
to attract other good people and,

21:03.120 --> 21:04.771
make sure they stick around.

21:06.923 --> 21:08.509
If you keep going down this path,

21:08.546 --> 21:10.633
your sister will come back...

21:11.646 --> 21:13.157
just like I did.

21:17.727 --> 21:19.735
Thank you, Charles.

21:21.905 --> 21:23.352
And now that I know about your mom,

21:23.389 --> 21:24.981
this whole "Godfather" obsession

21:25.018 --> 21:26.245
makes so much more sense.

21:26.282 --> 21:27.856
No, no, no. I just...

21:27.893 --> 21:30.968
I love those movies 'cause
they're the two best ever made.

21:31.148 --> 21:34.408
And your absent mother
who worked in organized crime

21:34.445 --> 21:35.850
didn't have something to do with it?

21:35.887 --> 21:37.441
Comparing the KC Mob

21:37.478 --> 21:38.791
to the Five Families of New York

21:38.828 --> 21:40.680
just shows your ignorance,
Charles, you know what?

21:40.717 --> 21:42.321
I'm gonna put on part one right now.

21:42.358 --> 21:43.975
I'm gonna talk over it the whole time.

21:44.012 --> 21:46.453
You're gonna see how wrong you are.

21:48.623 --> 21:50.304
Sure thing, Jim.

21:50.654 --> 21:52.344
Sounds great.
