WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:08.425
CURTAIN: With this sash comes
all the privileges of a Messenger.

00:08.508 --> 00:10.051
Wear them with pride.

00:10.135 --> 00:13.221
I think George Washington
likes his new outfit.

00:13.304 --> 00:14.931
You can joke, but this was the goal.

00:15.015 --> 00:18.184
Being a Messenger gets us
access and information.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.311
BENEDICT:
The Morse code has been compromised.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.397
Thankfully, not before they could warn us.

00:22.480 --> 00:23.940
-MILLIGAN: Someone's approaching.
-

00:24.024 --> 00:26.401
I'm Reynie Muldoon's teacher
from the Stonetown Orphanage.

00:26.484 --> 00:27.861
And my name is Nicholas Benedict.

00:27.944 --> 00:30.030
-These are my associates, Number Two...
-Where is Reynie?

00:30.113 --> 00:32.866
He's in school,
just not the one you expected.

00:33.324 --> 00:36.036
The man behind this
is a master manipulator.

00:36.119 --> 00:38.872
He is very real, and he's also my brother.

00:38.955 --> 00:42.542
This is all such a blatant disregard
for the safety

00:42.625 --> 00:43.918
of Reynie and his companions.

00:44.002 --> 00:47.338
CURTAIN: This gallery contains
my most prized invention.

00:47.422 --> 00:48.840
The Whisperer.

00:48.923 --> 00:51.009
I can hear George Washington.

00:51.092 --> 00:54.304
"Missing aren't missing..."

00:54.387 --> 00:56.139
They're only departed.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.683
KATE: Sticky just went to Messenger duty.
That's what it is!

00:58.767 --> 01:00.685
The voices you've been hearing,
they're Messengers!

01:00.769 --> 01:02.520
These testing protocols
are just wasting time.

01:02.604 --> 01:03.772
CURTAIN: Fast track all of it.

01:03.855 --> 01:06.316
Both farm and forest need
to be ready tomorrow for a trial run.

01:06.399 --> 01:09.861
We have to figure out a way to disable
the Whisperer without getting caught.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.654
Okay. What's the plan?

01:11.738 --> 01:14.240
We'll exfiltrate the children
at first light.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.283
What?

01:33.593 --> 01:35.386
NATHANIEL: Nicky, there you are.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.598
So, how do I look?

01:38.681 --> 01:42.310
Uh, shiny? What's that stuff in your hair?

01:42.393 --> 01:45.313
It's not stuff.
It's my house-made hair pomade.

01:45.396 --> 01:48.900
One part water, one part mineral oil,
some melted wax,

01:48.983 --> 01:51.486
and, last but not least,
four drops of sage essence

01:51.569 --> 01:54.155
I extracted myself
from some kitchen herbs.

01:54.447 --> 01:55.532
Steam distilled?

01:55.615 --> 01:57.492
Of course! Come on. Get up.

02:05.375 --> 02:09.003
Nobody's looking to adopt
a couple of scruffy street urchins, Nicky.

02:09.087 --> 02:11.589
They want kids who are clean,
well-groomed.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.926
Presentation is everything. Right?

02:15.593 --> 02:16.845
I guess.

02:16.928 --> 02:20.390
We might know how special we are,
but no one else will unless we show them.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.726
You'll thank me later when we're
with our new parents in our rooms

02:23.810 --> 02:25.937
with bunk beds that don't rattle and sag.

02:30.316 --> 02:33.862
I want to be supportive. I do.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.572
Is it even seaworthy?

02:35.655 --> 02:40.034
She was fashioned by the world's finest
sub-nautical artisans and engineers.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.996
I've run a battery of tests
on her engines, passed them all.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.625
And you condone this voyage?

02:48.042 --> 02:49.919
We must get the children.

02:50.545 --> 02:53.173
A surface vessel would be far too risky
at this point.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.091
But this vessel?

02:58.303 --> 02:59.470
Once on the island,

02:59.554 --> 03:01.347
I'll commence exfiltration
and be back in the water,

03:01.431 --> 03:03.141
heading towards base by nightfall.

03:03.224 --> 03:06.227
I'll run silent, run deep.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.563
I do have one, one question.

03:08.646 --> 03:11.399
Is there enough room in there
for one rather, um...

03:12.567 --> 03:15.486
significantly-sized adult
and four children?

03:20.116 --> 03:21.826
Have the children grown?

03:24.579 --> 03:26.456
-Uh...
-Just when you get there,

03:26.539 --> 03:30.001
paint a rock on the south shore
to let us know you arrived safely.

03:30.084 --> 03:31.961
Ah, just like Theseus.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.048
But didn't that story end horribly?

03:35.131 --> 03:37.383
Yes, it did. But this will work.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.488
NUMBER TWO: Permission to speak freely.

03:58.571 --> 04:01.491
Yes, of course.
But haven't you always had that?

04:01.574 --> 04:03.451
This is a terrible mistake.

04:03.534 --> 04:06.996
To abort mission because some enraged
middle school teacher...

04:07.080 --> 04:08.081
She has a name.

04:08.164 --> 04:11.125
...shows up with a slew
of ridiculous accusations?

04:11.209 --> 04:14.003
Gross negligence? Child endangerment?
It's absurd.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.298
No, no. Ms. Perumal is absolutely right.

04:17.382 --> 04:20.677
I placed children, innocent children,
in grave danger.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.178
I cannot let it continue a minute longer.

04:22.262 --> 04:26.516
Not just any children,
exceptional children.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.768
We chose them from thousands.

04:28.851 --> 04:30.061
-Yes, but--
-She's right.

04:30.144 --> 04:33.606
They all volunteered
of their own free will.

04:33.690 --> 04:39.737
And as you've said, they and everyone else
will be in more danger if they fail.

04:40.405 --> 04:44.784
They are smart, capable,
courageous children.

04:44.867 --> 04:47.996
And you put them
in that position to succeed.

04:48.079 --> 04:49.914
No. It's too late. It's too late.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.000
I have been fighting this battle
for so long,

04:52.083 --> 04:55.169
it is time for me to admit
that I have already failed. Done.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.462
RHONDA: You haven't failed.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.132
You just haven't finished yet.

04:59.841 --> 05:00.883
Please!

05:00.967 --> 05:05.513
Your concern is very much appreciated,
but the truth is you don't understand.

05:05.596 --> 05:06.681
Neither of you do.

05:06.764 --> 05:09.100
Understand what, exactly?

05:15.398 --> 05:17.567
I must prepare for the children's return.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.525
Do you know what today is, Isaac?

06:41.901 --> 06:44.570
Um, well, yesterday was Tuesday, so--

06:44.654 --> 06:45.988
Yes, it's Wednesday.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.951
But it's also the day we make history.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.495
It's a big day.

06:52.578 --> 06:56.541
And which Messenger gets to participate
in this historic moment?

06:56.624 --> 06:57.792
Hmm.

06:58.876 --> 07:01.087
I have the perfect candidate.

07:04.132 --> 07:07.176
REYNIE: Whatever this Improvement is,
it's happening soon.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.096
We have to figure out a way
to communicate with Mr. Benedict.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.099
Maybe the Improvement
will make things better.

07:13.182 --> 07:15.810
I mean, it is the definition
of improvement.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.729
When has Curtain ever made
anything better?

07:19.021 --> 07:20.064
Guys...

07:21.691 --> 07:22.733
It's go time.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.235
Tonight, after lights out,

07:24.318 --> 07:26.446
we storm the boulder-hatch,
take the laboratory.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.614
Finally, you talk sense.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.533
You said there's a scientist down there.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.660
She will be weak from lack of sunlight.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.078
Easy to neutralize.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.872
We're not neutralizing anyone.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.082
Any number of nonlethal weapons will work.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.168
I could craft a basic arsenal in no time.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.128
I can make paralytic from spider venom.

07:42.211 --> 07:45.173
No. No paralytics. No weapons.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.049
You lack spine.

07:47.592 --> 07:50.303
Look, we know his plan involves
a farm and a forest.

07:50.386 --> 07:54.432
Farm? I haven't seen a pig
or a chicken or a cow.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.142
There are other types of farms.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.352
Oyster farms, honey farms...

07:58.436 --> 07:59.812
Organ farms.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.192
What?

08:04.275 --> 08:05.902
If we can figure out what the farm is,

08:05.985 --> 08:08.154
then we can figure out
how to stop the Improvement.

08:08.237 --> 08:09.864
And destroy the Whisperer
once and for all.

08:09.947 --> 08:13.409
Maybe there's another way
to stop the Improvement

08:13.743 --> 08:15.620
without destroying the...

08:15.703 --> 08:16.746
Whisperer.

08:17.205 --> 08:20.166
I mean, the Whisperer itself isn't evil.

08:20.249 --> 08:21.375
It's just a tool.

08:21.459 --> 08:22.543
You're not serious.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.587
Sticky, I know how you feel.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.214
I felt the same thing.

08:26.297 --> 08:29.550
It makes all your anxiety
and stress just evaporate.

08:29.634 --> 08:30.718
Is that a bad thing?

08:30.801 --> 08:31.844
REYNIE: For us, no.

08:31.928 --> 08:35.014
But for everyone else
getting those messages, it is.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.642
It's causing nothing
but anxiety and stress.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.852
He's drinking the Kool-Aid.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.187
Gulping it.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.690
Look, the only people we can rely on
are each other.

08:44.774 --> 08:50.196
That means we have to work together
and trust each other more than ever, okay?

08:53.074 --> 08:54.367
Mr. Washington.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.079
You're wanted for Messenger duty.

09:07.255 --> 09:10.800
I didn't realize I'd get called back
to the Whisperer so soon.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.636
Not all thoughts need to be vocalized.

09:13.970 --> 09:17.056
Right, right. I'm just a little excited.

09:17.139 --> 09:19.183
Perfectly understandable.

09:29.026 --> 09:30.528
CURTAIN: Sticky Washington.

09:31.696 --> 09:32.947
Friend.

09:34.490 --> 09:35.616
Welcome back.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.202
Thank you.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.874
It's a testament to your tremendous mind.

09:43.958 --> 09:47.295
What you did yesterday was outstanding.

09:47.378 --> 09:48.963
Exhilarating, actually.

09:49.964 --> 09:52.425
Really? I don't remember anything.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.429
Do you remember how calm
and assured it made you feel?

09:57.430 --> 09:58.598
Yes.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.311
It feels the same way about you.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.065
The machine?

10:08.399 --> 10:10.776
The Whisperer was humming.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.195
Alive with possibilities.

10:13.654 --> 10:17.325
Inspired to be paired
with such a fertile mind.

10:18.242 --> 10:19.452
You're special, Sticky.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.662
You really are.

10:22.955 --> 10:26.834
So many Messengers
unconsciously fight the Whisperer.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.210
They push back.

10:31.088 --> 10:32.673
Reynie Muldoon, for instance.

10:34.175 --> 10:37.845
But you somehow learned
how to become one with the machine.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.930
Thank you, sir.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.975
Please... have a seat.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.561
Let's get started.

11:03.412 --> 11:06.374
KATE: Did you see his face light up
at the mention of Messenger duty?

11:06.832 --> 11:08.125
It's kinda creepy.

11:08.751 --> 11:12.004
He's jumping ship. Savvy play.

11:12.630 --> 11:16.467
He's not jumping ship.
It's just... the Whisperer.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.054
It's so... soothing.

11:20.554 --> 11:22.890
If you two are Messengers,
you know what he's going through.

11:22.973 --> 11:25.267
Even if we were Messenger material,
no, thank you.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.769
I'd take a taste.

11:27.561 --> 11:31.273
Look, right now, we need to focus
on the farm and the forest.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.651
I'll talk to S.Q., see what he knows.

11:34.193 --> 11:37.154
Kate, you talk to Martina.
She's an Executive now.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.948
She has access everywhere.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.409
I'll try, but getting her
to talk about anything

11:41.492 --> 11:43.327
other than tetherball won't be easy.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.787
CONSTANCE: What about me?

11:45.996 --> 11:47.540
What's my mission?

11:49.625 --> 11:52.002
Why don't you stay the course?

11:52.086 --> 11:55.631
Go to class, keep your eyes
and your ears open.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.772
STICKY: Hurry up. Time is wasting.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.735
Put on your shoes and grab your coat.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.070
Don't stay indoors.

12:18.612 --> 12:21.198
Avoid the rain and cover your head.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.994
When you look good, you feel better.

12:28.914 --> 12:31.167
Hurry up. Time is wasting.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.171
Put on your shoes and grab your coat.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.758
Don't stay inside.

12:41.677 --> 12:44.180
I'm glad I finally got you
to turn off the television.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.641
And how many game shows
can one person watch?

12:47.725 --> 12:49.101
I like game shows.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.520
-Sue me.

12:51.604 --> 12:52.813
-Sue me in court.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.190
I'll go get the tea.

12:57.693 --> 13:00.780
STICKY: Avoid the rain
and cover your head.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.908
When you look good, you feel better.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.379
-Mom?
-I wanna go shopping.

14:07.721 --> 14:08.848
Hmm.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.382
RHONDA: Here's another one dealing
with radio waves.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.801
Ah, the sleep pattern
of the North Egyptian wood mouse.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.135
Yes.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.304
Describing how these patterns
were disrupted

16:12.388 --> 16:14.640
by a new TV transmission tower.

16:14.723 --> 16:16.141
You're grasping at straws.

16:16.225 --> 16:19.395
Obviously, he wants to stop Curtain
more than anyone, especially now.

16:19.478 --> 16:22.147
But if he says he's tried everything here
and none of it's worked,

16:22.648 --> 16:23.774
I believe him.

16:23.857 --> 16:26.068
I hear that. I honor that.

16:26.485 --> 16:30.239
But isn't that just another way of saying
he came this close to solving the puzzle,

16:30.322 --> 16:32.241
but just couldn't crack it?

16:32.950 --> 16:36.870
One could argue that a great puzzle solver
knows when to move on to the next puzzle.

16:36.954 --> 16:40.624
Or maybe the great puzzle solver
is just discouraged.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.264
REYNIE: S.Q.

16:56.432 --> 16:57.558
What are you up to?

16:58.058 --> 17:02.021
Actually, I was just noticing
the light on the water.

17:02.563 --> 17:06.567
Yeah, those sparkles are pretty hard
to get right with pencil.

17:06.650 --> 17:07.568
You draw?

17:08.193 --> 17:09.528
As much as I can.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.321
-Definitely.
-Hmm.

17:11.655 --> 17:12.865
Didn't know that.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.284
Oh, yeah. I love to draw.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.162
Especially nature, trees.

17:19.747 --> 17:22.207
There's an amazing forest
right here on the island.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.334
Really? A forest?

17:24.418 --> 17:25.878
I go there to draw.

17:25.961 --> 17:29.173
Or just sit, listen to the sounds.

17:29.631 --> 17:33.927
Oh, nice. So how do you get there?

17:34.386 --> 17:37.598
I'm the only student allowed.
Authorized access only.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.601
You can't bring a friend?

17:41.018 --> 17:43.145
My dad won't allow anyone but me.

17:48.400 --> 17:53.572
You know, my teacher, Ms. Perumal,
she really didn't want me to come here.

17:53.655 --> 17:56.241
She was sure this school wasn't for me.

17:56.742 --> 18:01.038
But, eventually,
I just had to decide for myself.

18:13.842 --> 18:16.303
MARTINA:
Look who decided to show her face.

18:16.845 --> 18:17.846
What do you mean?

18:17.930 --> 18:21.183
I'm, like... three minutes
and 28 seconds early.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.353
I'm talking about last night.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.146
Where were you?

18:26.230 --> 18:28.690
I knocked on your door after curfew.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.654
I was sleeping.
I'm a very, very deep sleeper.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.614
-Coma deep.
-Mm-hmm.

18:37.407 --> 18:38.784
What about your roommate?

18:39.451 --> 18:40.828
I was knocking pretty hard.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.205
Partial hearing loss. Fireworks.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.750
What did you want, anyway?

18:46.834 --> 18:49.336
I thought you might want to come by
the Executives Colonnade

18:49.419 --> 18:51.130
and see my new single room.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.214
All to myself.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.341
But, anyway...

18:54.424 --> 18:57.261
You have your own room? Wow.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.638
Yeah. One of the many perks.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.224
Seems like there are a lot.

19:02.724 --> 19:06.520
Yeah, well... they come with a lot
of duties, so we earn them.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.481
What... what kind of duties?

19:09.815 --> 19:12.234
MARTINA: Oh, a bunch of high-level stuff.

19:12.693 --> 19:16.196
Admin. Logistics, security...

19:16.280 --> 19:18.157
...and cleaning.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.868
What are you cleaning?
I thought the Helpers did that.

19:20.951 --> 19:23.453
Oh, no. Only Executives are allowed
to clean the server room.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.914
They call it dust abatement.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.542
You dust the server... farm?

19:28.625 --> 19:30.419
MARTINA: Yeah. That's what I said.

19:30.502 --> 19:33.463
Tons of computers,
which means lots of dust.

19:33.797 --> 19:35.966
Not my favorite part of the job
if I'm being honest.

19:36.049 --> 19:37.259
I wouldn't blame you.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.261
Well, it's very important.

19:39.678 --> 19:43.807
So... best of the best.
All right. Let's volley.

19:49.313 --> 19:52.399
You know, I just want to say,
playing tetherball...

19:52.482 --> 19:53.817
easily the best part of my day.

19:53.901 --> 19:55.235
Thanks for bringing me on the team.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.696
I could tell right away.
Tetherball's in your blood.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.951
You know, if the offer still stands,

20:03.035 --> 20:06.496
I wouldn't mind coming by
and checking out your sweet new room.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.581
Done.

20:07.664 --> 20:11.418
Come over after study hour.
We could watch the WTA quarterfinals.

20:11.501 --> 20:12.586
All four matches.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.296
Cannot wait!

20:17.049 --> 20:18.175
CURTAIN: Oh.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.594
I thought I politely asked you
to give me my space today.

20:21.845 --> 20:22.971
You did.

20:23.972 --> 20:26.725
Yes. My personal space.

20:27.809 --> 20:30.938
It's important for any relationship,
much less the parent-child dynamic.

20:31.271 --> 20:35.150
Sorry, I'm leaving.
Just needed to grab the binoculars.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.360
Oh.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.320
I'm going to the forest.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.738
Fine.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.241
With a friend.

20:48.455 --> 20:49.748
Interesting, um...

20:51.625 --> 20:54.920
When I told you
you could go past the bollard fence,

20:55.003 --> 20:57.422
I, I'm really sure
I gave you a few conditions.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.841
Maybe I'm misremembering?

21:02.386 --> 21:06.598
No, you did.
I'm allowed to take in art supplies only.

21:06.682 --> 21:10.394
I'm permitted in during mid-morning
and mid-afternoon, but not midday.

21:11.311 --> 21:14.940
Alone. Completely. Alone.

21:15.023 --> 21:16.108
Yes.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.193
That's it.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.572
This friend of yours, um...

21:23.407 --> 21:24.700
Do they have a name?

21:28.578 --> 21:29.746
Reynie.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.127
Reynie Muldoon.

21:38.755 --> 21:41.425
S.Q., I need to tell you something, um...

21:42.676 --> 21:45.679
When students at the school
are friendly towards you,

21:45.762 --> 21:47.597
you need to put that in context

21:47.681 --> 21:50.434
and ask yourself what their motives
might be, all right?

21:51.059 --> 21:52.728
Why would they need a motive?

21:53.854 --> 21:56.064
Well, you're in the unique position
of having my ear,

21:56.148 --> 21:59.151
so people may act
a certain way toward you.

21:59.693 --> 22:00.986
Reynie's not acting.

22:01.611 --> 22:02.863
He's my friend.

22:02.946 --> 22:05.032
CURTAIN: Your friend. I see.

22:05.407 --> 22:10.871
Son, I've always told you

22:11.663 --> 22:16.293
that the past is a good indication
of the present, correct?

22:16.793 --> 22:22.716
And in the past, let's face it,
you haven't had many friends.

22:25.427 --> 22:28.680
In fact, how many friends have you had?

22:37.564 --> 22:39.316
I'm just trying to protect you.

22:41.526 --> 22:44.488
Listen, when I was your age,
I was misunderstood also.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.573
But you know what?

22:46.656 --> 22:47.991
It's a good thing.

22:48.742 --> 22:50.243
It fueled me.

23:04.758 --> 23:06.343
REYNIE: Dear Ms. Perumal,

23:06.426 --> 23:09.262
I think of you often and hope you're well.

23:09.971 --> 23:12.099
I'm pretty good, I guess.

23:13.392 --> 23:17.354
This mission I'm on,
it requires a large amount of deception.

23:17.437 --> 23:20.148
Which is really just a way of saying
I have to lie...

23:21.024 --> 23:22.317
a lot...

23:22.943 --> 23:24.528
to people that I like.

23:25.529 --> 23:26.780
It's strange.

23:27.072 --> 23:30.450
It seems like the more I lie,
the better I get at it.

23:31.701 --> 23:33.662
And the worse I start to feel.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.165
It's like I'm losing who I am.

23:38.583 --> 23:41.169
I understand
that our mission is important,

23:41.420 --> 23:46.967
but this feeling I get when I'm lying,
sometimes I wonder if it's even worth it.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.511
Oh. Hey, Reynie.

23:49.594 --> 23:52.472
Hey! So, how was the Whisperer?

23:53.014 --> 23:54.641
Oh, fine. No big deal.

23:56.351 --> 23:57.477
Really?

23:58.019 --> 24:00.147
Yeah, you know, a little boring.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.774
Dr. Curtain asked me
to join him for lunch today.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.153
What?

24:07.195 --> 24:08.363
I don't know.

24:08.447 --> 24:13.285
I just think it's kind of weird how eager
you are to be having lunch with him.

24:14.202 --> 24:17.956
You're the one who's always saying,
"We need to get into his inner circle."

24:18.999 --> 24:23.170
This is different.
It's almost like you're... enjoying it.

24:24.504 --> 24:25.714
Why wouldn't I?

24:27.507 --> 24:28.884
Being acknowledged?

24:31.052 --> 24:32.095
Wait.

24:33.513 --> 24:34.514
You're jealous.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.391
What? No, I'm not.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.477
It's okay. You were the golden child.

24:38.560 --> 24:42.522
And now... it makes sense. I'm not upset.

24:42.606 --> 24:44.524
I'm not jealous. I'm worried.

24:44.774 --> 24:45.775
Kate's right, Sticky.

24:45.859 --> 24:50.489
Ever since you started spending time
in the Whisperer, you've changed.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.782
You're right. I have changed.

24:53.408 --> 24:56.036
I used to be a nervous mess, and now--

24:56.119 --> 24:59.539
The Whisperer is manipulating your mind,
your emotions.

24:59.623 --> 25:00.790
I know.

25:01.958 --> 25:03.001
For the better.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.713
I see what this is.

25:07.047 --> 25:11.968
Somewhere deep down,
you like when I'm anxious, don't you?

25:12.052 --> 25:15.430
What? No. That's crazy. Of course not.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.015
Makes you feel better about yourself.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.433
Admit it.

25:20.644 --> 25:21.645
Sticky!

25:29.819 --> 25:31.821
Mom, slow down.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.159
Oh, look at these beautiful beets.

25:36.243 --> 25:39.079
Better stock up.
Who knows how long we'll have 'em.

25:39.162 --> 25:40.121
What do you mean?

25:40.205 --> 25:41.414
The season just began.

25:41.498 --> 25:45.502
Soil depletion. Drought.
Just read the papers.

25:48.505 --> 25:52.551
-Mom? Where are you rushing off to?
-MS. PERUMAL'S MOM: I need a new hat.

26:48.523 --> 26:50.817
WOMAN: What good's that gonna
do me when the banks close?

26:50.900 --> 26:51.735
I need my paper.

26:51.818 --> 26:54.029
-I need to know what's going on!
-I need cash.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.196
MAN: Are you kidding me?

26:55.280 --> 26:56.531
WOMAN: Give me the cash.

27:01.578 --> 27:04.372
Hey! Is everything all right?

27:04.456 --> 27:05.415
Yeah.

27:06.207 --> 27:07.250
Are you sure?

27:07.584 --> 27:09.919
I asked my dad
if I could take a friend to the forest.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.213
He yelled at me for even considering it.

27:12.631 --> 27:16.259
If anyone happens to think being friends
with me is a way to impress my dad...

27:17.260 --> 27:18.511
they're wrong.

27:18.928 --> 27:20.597
We don't have that kind of relationship.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.349
That's not what I'm doing.

27:22.766 --> 27:25.810
Most of the kids here don't want to talk
about anything real.

27:26.353 --> 27:27.604
You're different.

27:30.231 --> 27:31.274
Did you do that?

27:31.358 --> 27:33.443
Oh, this? Yeah.

27:33.693 --> 27:37.113
-I can't draw like you can, but...
-No, that's cool.

27:37.864 --> 27:40.200
You actually captured
the light pretty well.

27:40.283 --> 27:41.576
You have a good eye.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.579
Sorry I can't take you to the forest.

27:48.625 --> 27:49.668
Maybe you can.

27:50.251 --> 27:51.419
You know what they say,

27:51.753 --> 27:55.840
"Sometimes it's better to apologize
than to ask permission."

28:01.971 --> 28:05.975
Such great parents. Here we are!

28:07.477 --> 28:10.522
Hello, nice to meet you.
My name is Nathaniel Benedict.

28:10.605 --> 28:12.357
-Well, hello.
-Great show.

28:13.608 --> 28:19.322
"Now is the winter of our discontent,
made glorious summer by this sun of York.

28:19.406 --> 28:22.117
And all the clouds that lowered
upon our house..."

28:22.659 --> 28:23.993
Impressive.

28:24.077 --> 28:27.122
"In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

28:27.205 --> 28:31.376
Now are our brows bound
with victorious wreaths,

28:31.459 --> 28:35.004
our bruised arms hung up for monuments."

28:35.630 --> 28:36.840
It's Richard III.

28:38.299 --> 28:41.553
My brother, Nicholas,
he can do long division in his head.

28:41.636 --> 28:42.762
I taught him how.

28:43.221 --> 28:46.307
With us, you get two for the price of one,
no strings attached.

28:46.850 --> 28:50.353
He doesn't take up much space, really.
Or eat much, for that matter.

28:54.107 --> 28:57.444
I'm sorry to say
that we only have room for one, buddy.

28:57.861 --> 29:02.282
If you can only take one, we understand.
We want what's best for each other.

29:02.532 --> 29:05.243
-That's really sweet.
-WOMAN: He's right over here.

29:15.295 --> 29:16.337
Hello.

29:17.505 --> 29:19.048
We hear you like to read.

29:22.218 --> 29:23.470
CURTAIN: There are times in life

29:23.553 --> 29:26.723
where one must stand in the spotlight
and take a bow.

29:27.807 --> 29:31.269
At first, you might find it difficult
to outshine those people

29:31.352 --> 29:33.062
that are close to you.

29:34.022 --> 29:37.025
But that thinking is weak. It's a trap.

29:43.573 --> 29:46.618
It's grass-finished, dry-aged prime wagyu.

29:46.910 --> 29:47.994
Wagyu.

29:48.578 --> 29:52.207
That's a prized breed of steer.
Originated in Japan, right?

29:53.458 --> 29:54.709
I tell you.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.544
Unlike others around here,

29:56.628 --> 29:59.839
I do not find your knowledge of facts
and figures annoying at all.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.592
Go ahead, dig in.

30:03.593 --> 30:06.805
After what you did in the Whisperer today,
you more than deserve it.

30:09.682 --> 30:13.603
Your compatibility index scores
are staggering.

30:14.103 --> 30:17.190
Projection sub-coherence,
relative congruity...

30:18.191 --> 30:20.652
You set Institute records in all of them.

30:21.486 --> 30:22.612
I gotta be honest with you,

30:22.695 --> 30:25.865
I actually thought it was your roommate
that had the potential.

30:26.449 --> 30:28.910
But after seeing
his compatibility scores...

30:29.410 --> 30:30.620
Oof.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.413
Who? Reynie?

30:32.497 --> 30:35.291
Oh... It's perfect.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.168
Look at that marbling.

30:38.086 --> 30:39.462
Try the horseradish.

30:45.301 --> 30:48.763
So, tell me.
How well do you know Reynard Muldoon?

30:50.181 --> 30:52.016
Oh...

30:52.100 --> 30:54.185
I don't... know him all that well.

30:54.644 --> 30:56.312
He's kind of quiet.

30:56.604 --> 31:00.066
Oh, that's interesting.
I would have thought the opposite.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.694
Kind of a classic outgoing introvert.

31:02.777 --> 31:05.113
Keenly interested in others all the time.

31:05.196 --> 31:07.282
But you know him better than I do.

31:08.408 --> 31:11.286
Actually, I've only known him
since I've gotten here.

31:14.622 --> 31:17.000
You ignored each other
in the vehicle you arrived in together?

31:17.625 --> 31:21.337
I meant, I met him on the car ride over.
He was... friendly.

31:21.754 --> 31:23.381
Like I said, outgoing.

31:26.175 --> 31:30.096
But I worry...
Sometimes that focus on others...

31:30.471 --> 31:34.684
not always, of course,
but sometimes, it's a means to hide.

31:35.602 --> 31:37.937
To divert attention away from some...

31:38.021 --> 31:40.648
...ulterior motive, you know?

31:41.274 --> 31:44.110
The only motive I see from Reynie
is getting good grades.

31:44.527 --> 31:46.237
Most of the time, he just studies.

31:46.738 --> 31:47.780
Oh.

31:48.156 --> 31:49.282
CURTAIN: Yeah, well...

31:49.365 --> 31:53.995
I guess I have a more nuanced view
of success in an academic context.

31:54.996 --> 31:58.124
It's not just hours
of your face in a book.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.878
I see it as a process
of revealing what's within.

32:01.961 --> 32:04.088
That's where your greatness lies, Sticky.

32:06.007 --> 32:07.091
Within.

32:09.510 --> 32:10.678
Thanks.

32:11.012 --> 32:12.263
Oh.

32:12.347 --> 32:14.474
Don't ever thank others for your success.

32:15.058 --> 32:16.309
You earned it.

32:21.230 --> 32:22.774
And don't over-sauce.

32:23.816 --> 32:25.985
It's clumsy and dishonors the animal.

32:30.657 --> 32:34.243
You're gonna be spending a lot more time
in the Whisperer, Sticky.

32:36.079 --> 32:37.455
A lot more time.

32:42.877 --> 32:45.046
S.Q.: Careful of poison ivy
from here on out.

32:45.129 --> 32:46.172
It's everywhere.

32:46.839 --> 32:49.592
You were right. This place is incredible.

32:50.426 --> 32:52.637
Why is it off-limits?

32:53.012 --> 32:54.555
Something to do with my dad's work.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.057
He's here a lot with his friend.

32:56.432 --> 32:59.143
Well, I guess she feels like
she has to be his friend.

32:59.477 --> 33:00.770
Chief scientist.

33:01.521 --> 33:03.022
What type of scientist?

33:03.231 --> 33:05.400
I'm not sure. Neuroscience, maybe?

33:05.733 --> 33:07.860
That's what my birth father did
with Dr. Curtain.

33:08.361 --> 33:09.821
They worked together?

33:09.904 --> 33:11.280
When I was a baby.

33:12.115 --> 33:14.534
Then he got sick and, you know...

33:14.909 --> 33:16.327
Curtain adopted you.

33:20.206 --> 33:22.041
-COMMENTATOR 1: It all comes down to this.

33:22.125 --> 33:25.378
The last two points
between two bitter rivals

33:25.461 --> 33:29.465
in what might be the last
of Nygård Jorgenson's storied career.

33:29.549 --> 33:32.176
COMMENTATOR 2:
The flag is up, and Norway serves.

33:32.260 --> 33:35.513
A flyover and a backhand follow-up strike
by Jorgenson.

33:35.596 --> 33:36.514
Oh!

33:36.597 --> 33:38.433
-Did you see that reverse catapult slam?
-And right into a reverse slam.

33:38.516 --> 33:39.434
How could I not?

33:39.517 --> 33:40.977
COMMENTATOR 1: Let's take another look.

33:41.060 --> 33:43.479
A perfect crossover spin step sets her up

33:43.563 --> 33:44.981
-for the spectacular reverse slam.
-You were right.

33:45.064 --> 33:47.358
The Norwegians have the best
foot technique I've ever seen.

33:48.443 --> 33:49.360
Masterful.

33:49.444 --> 33:52.030
-Norway is now one step closer to victory.
-Watch Nygård.

33:52.113 --> 33:55.074
-If just joining us, we have an...
-You could learn from her.

33:55.158 --> 33:58.578
MARTINA: She's a strong hitter,
but all her power comes from her footwork.

33:59.662 --> 34:03.583
COMMENTATOR 2: And it is as close
of a match-up as I've seen in years...

34:06.961 --> 34:08.087
KATE: Totally.

34:08.379 --> 34:11.132
I want to try that.
Doesn't seem too complicated.

34:11.215 --> 34:14.594
It's not. Classic approach,
nothing revolutionary.

34:14.677 --> 34:17.305
Knees bent, step across,
and back with a swing.

34:17.388 --> 34:19.265
She just does it with absolute precision.

34:21.267 --> 34:22.268
What are you doing?

34:22.351 --> 34:23.519
Uh...

34:33.696 --> 34:36.199
You have to keep your hip in.

34:36.282 --> 34:39.035
Can't open up too early, or else
you're gonna have to overcompensate.

34:39.410 --> 34:41.329
No wonder it didn't feel right.

34:42.497 --> 34:44.290
COMMENTATOR 2: Nygård now serves.

34:44.999 --> 34:46.918
Baaken avoids the wraparound,
goes on the attack.

34:47.001 --> 34:48.753
Baaken does not want to lose.

34:48.836 --> 34:49.879
Her knuckle-down technique

34:49.962 --> 34:51.172
is the only thing keeping her
in this thing.

34:51.839 --> 34:56.511
The Executive snack stand we passed,
do they have protein bars?

34:56.928 --> 35:00.389
'Cause after practice, I always try
to top off my B12 levels. Maybe--

35:00.473 --> 35:02.058
No way. I don't want to miss anything.

35:02.141 --> 35:03.684
COMMENTATOR 2: Takes back control,
goes on the attack

35:03.768 --> 35:05.186
with a slam points scored...

35:05.269 --> 35:08.356
-Wraparound! Let's go!
-COMMENTATOR 2: Stay with us, folks!

35:08.439 --> 35:11.859
We will be back with more excitements
after these messages.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.737
ANNOUNCER: Tired of spending
your hard-earned cash on plumbers?

35:14.821 --> 35:17.073
Pipestop stops leaks in minutes!
Use our Pipestop...

35:17.156 --> 35:19.575
Commercials. Now's your chance.

35:19.659 --> 35:21.202
I'm not really that hungry.

35:21.577 --> 35:22.995
Eat strong, be strong.

35:23.079 --> 35:25.873
Athletes like us,
nutrition's our gasoline.

35:26.666 --> 35:28.501
You know what? You just reminded me.

35:29.210 --> 35:32.171
Got so caught up with the match,
I almost forgot.

35:43.349 --> 35:46.102
I know it's in here somewhere.

35:47.353 --> 35:51.816
Oh. Here it is.

36:00.032 --> 36:01.701
-What is that?
-Huh?

36:02.827 --> 36:04.704
On your hands. Those dots.

36:05.037 --> 36:09.876
I was just marking down foot patterns.

36:09.959 --> 36:11.294
I'm gonna study these.

36:11.794 --> 36:14.255
Those don't look like foot patterns.

36:14.463 --> 36:16.299
I have my own shorthand?

36:18.259 --> 36:19.677
You know what I think?

36:23.598 --> 36:25.975
I think you're a winner, Kate Wetherall.

36:26.767 --> 36:28.603
A stone-cold killer.

36:29.395 --> 36:30.688
Just like me.

36:32.481 --> 36:33.774
I...

36:34.442 --> 36:35.860
I made this for you.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.323
-For me?
-Mm-hmm.

36:40.948 --> 36:45.411
Wow! This is actually...
really nice, Martina.

37:10.353 --> 37:11.437
S.Q.: Almost there.

37:15.149 --> 37:16.192
Here we are.

37:19.028 --> 37:22.573
Wow. It's incredible.

37:23.783 --> 37:24.825
Right?

37:29.205 --> 37:30.665
What are you looking for?

37:31.707 --> 37:33.084
Oh, nothing.

37:33.167 --> 37:35.628
I mean, all I can see are trees.

37:36.254 --> 37:39.590
I guess I was expecting
to see more wildlife.

37:40.508 --> 37:44.095
If all you can see are trees,
then you're not really looking.

37:44.887 --> 37:47.932
There. Below that tree. A deer.

37:49.141 --> 37:52.770
-REYNIE: That's weird.
-S.Q.: Not really. Deer like leaves.

37:53.854 --> 37:56.399
-Can I see the binoculars?
-Sure.

38:12.248 --> 38:16.252
-Those aren't real trees.
-They're antennas. Part of my dad's work.

38:19.046 --> 38:20.923
REYNIE: There must be hundreds of them.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.508
What are they for?

38:22.842 --> 38:25.678
I don't know, but he says,
once they're turned on,

38:25.761 --> 38:27.638
I have to stay away for a while.

38:28.264 --> 38:32.893
They cause tumors or something.
Hope somebody tells the deer.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.981
When is it gonna be turned on?

38:38.232 --> 38:39.400
S.Q.: Tomorrow...

38:40.901 --> 38:42.278
Twenty-two hours from now.

38:46.032 --> 38:48.075
-WOMAN: Hurry.
-

38:49.535 --> 38:51.787
-MAN: We got it.
-A line this long for a haberdashery?

38:52.079 --> 38:53.122
I don't get it.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.958
I told you we should have come in earlier.

38:57.209 --> 38:58.502
So weird.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.671
Everyone's getting that same blue hat.

39:00.755 --> 39:01.964
It's a beret.

39:04.133 --> 39:06.260
MS. PERUMAL: Are they running
a lot of ads for it on TV?

39:06.344 --> 39:08.763
I don't know. I just need one.

39:08.846 --> 39:11.265
MS. PERUMAL'S MOM: I don't know
what I'll do if they sell out.

39:30.785 --> 39:33.204
-Should have been me.
-I know.

39:33.287 --> 39:36.499
-What do they even see in you?
-I have no idea.

39:36.582 --> 39:39.210
You'll come back for me, right, Nicky?

39:39.293 --> 39:42.213
Of course.
I'll convince them to adopt you, too.

39:42.296 --> 39:45.007
And if they say no,
I'll come back and get you anyway.

39:47.093 --> 39:48.427
I promise.

40:51.824 --> 40:57.371
Turns out, Mr. Benedict had
a lot more here than he let on.

40:57.455 --> 40:58.539
No doubt.

40:58.956 --> 41:01.542
Oh, that's a wonderfully
executed parabola.

41:01.625 --> 41:03.711
-It is. Hmm.
-NUMBER TWO: Hand-drawn.

41:03.794 --> 41:06.005
Although, he may have missed
a French curve.

41:06.088 --> 41:07.339
I'm sorry.

41:09.508 --> 41:11.552
-RHONDA: What?
-You have nothing to be sorry for.

41:12.011 --> 41:13.220
I lied.

41:14.013 --> 41:15.806
I lied the worst possible lie.

41:16.849 --> 41:18.601
What did you lie about?

41:22.062 --> 41:24.899
It wasn't the size of the house
that impressed me.

41:26.650 --> 41:30.321
It was just that it was so quiet
and peaceful.

41:31.155 --> 41:33.282
And there were books.

41:33.365 --> 41:35.868
So many books. Great books.

41:35.951 --> 41:41.707
Fiction and nonfiction, science fiction,
and narrative memoirs, and biographies...

41:41.790 --> 41:44.293
-And then, finally, I was alone.
-Deep breaths.

41:44.376 --> 41:45.669
I was left to be,

41:45.753 --> 41:49.632
without my brother trying to constantly
control my every move.

41:49.715 --> 41:51.258
It was... Oh...

41:53.052 --> 41:54.303
Hate to admit.

41:55.763 --> 41:56.889
It was delightful.

41:56.972 --> 41:58.474
-Okay, stop.
-Go on.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.936
I waited too long.

42:03.479 --> 42:05.523
But I finally built up the nerve.

42:05.606 --> 42:10.986
I was going to ask my parents
to consider also adopting my brother.

42:11.820 --> 42:13.781
It was over Sunday breakfast.

42:14.365 --> 42:17.618
I steadied myself, I took a deep breath.

42:17.701 --> 42:20.829
Then, when I opened my mouth
to speak, I said...

42:23.666 --> 42:24.917
Nothing.

42:26.126 --> 42:27.503
I said nothing.

42:28.546 --> 42:31.465
-It's all right.
-It's very much not all right.

42:31.549 --> 42:34.385
My brother. My blood. My best friend.

42:34.468 --> 42:37.137
And I betrayed him
in the worst possible way.

42:37.221 --> 42:39.807
-You were just a child.
-You didn't know any better.

42:39.890 --> 42:44.520
I most certainly did.
The Emergency, the Improvement...

42:44.603 --> 42:47.356
If I had returned,
if I had come back the way I promised,

42:47.439 --> 42:50.109
if I had an ounce of loyalty,
none of it would have happened!

42:50.192 --> 42:52.570
That's pure speculation, sir.

42:52.653 --> 42:57.199
Really? Imagine if,
instead of being abandoned and betrayed,

42:57.283 --> 43:01.662
he was adopted into a loving family
and raised like I was.

43:01.745 --> 43:03.706
Would he have become
the madman he is today?

43:03.789 --> 43:04.790
I highly doubt it.

43:04.873 --> 43:06.959
The eternal debate of nature versus...

43:07.042 --> 43:09.336
-Nurture.
-It'll never be settled.

43:09.420 --> 43:12.298
And to beat yourself up
over something that was not

43:12.381 --> 43:14.883
and has never been your fault won't help.

43:15.384 --> 43:21.807
In fact, it'll make it far worse.
We need you. The children need you.

43:21.890 --> 43:23.392
It's the truth.

43:23.809 --> 43:25.102
So, please.

43:32.359 --> 43:36.196
I'll beg forgiveness from those brave
children when they return.

43:37.573 --> 43:39.450
You both are so kind,

43:39.533 --> 43:42.244
but after hearing my moral smallness,

43:43.579 --> 43:46.373
I would understand
if you two would like to...

43:47.374 --> 43:48.626
resign.

43:51.253 --> 43:52.546
-Never.
-Never.

44:32.044 --> 44:33.671
-

44:52.648 --> 44:55.109
DR. GARRISON: Seven hundred
and sixty-three berets purchased.

44:55.192 --> 44:57.194
Even higher than my projections.

44:58.737 --> 45:00.739
-Tremendous work.
-Thank you.

45:00.823 --> 45:04.451
I've just taken the messaging transmitters
off-line to prepare for tomorrow.

45:05.119 --> 45:07.079
Nineteen hours and counting.

45:08.038 --> 45:09.415
A toast, doctor.

45:09.998 --> 45:12.209
I've been sober for five years.

45:13.460 --> 45:15.462
I've always said,

45:15.754 --> 45:18.841
when you have a good thing,
improve on it and make it great.

45:19.508 --> 45:22.553
And when you have something great,
make it greater.

45:22.636 --> 45:25.889
-Never stop, only grow.

45:26.598 --> 45:31.687
Because beyond the edge
of what's possible lies the magnificent.

45:34.815 --> 45:38.026
We're about to go beyond
the edge of possible, my friend.

45:53.834 --> 45:55.294
REYNIE: Solid work, Kate.

45:56.378 --> 45:58.881
Round the edges,
a coat of quick-dry lacquer,

45:58.964 --> 46:00.424
Executive access granted.

46:00.799 --> 46:02.092
I'll do it on the way. Let's go.

46:02.176 --> 46:05.929
Not without Constance.
It's not like her to just disappear.

46:06.680 --> 46:07.890
Have you seen her today?

46:07.973 --> 46:10.476
How would you
if she wasn't on a steak cart?

46:10.809 --> 46:14.021
None of us have seen Constance
at all since this morning.

46:14.438 --> 46:15.647
I'm starting to worry.

46:15.731 --> 46:16.940
Constance will be fine.

46:17.024 --> 46:18.776
The rest of us? Not so much.

46:18.859 --> 46:21.236
Unless the Whisperer
is trashed once and for all.

46:21.320 --> 46:24.406
I don't know. Sounds kinda risky.

46:24.490 --> 46:27.367
I saw the antennas, Sticky.
They were giant.

46:27.451 --> 46:28.660
And S.Q. confirmed it.

46:28.744 --> 46:30.954
The Improvement's signal
goes wide tomorrow.

46:31.038 --> 46:33.999
I'm just saying, shouldn't we know
Curtain's plan exactly

46:34.082 --> 46:35.918
before we get into commando mode?

46:41.715 --> 46:44.343
-I did not need the spot.
-Where have you been?

46:44.968 --> 46:46.053
In the ceiling.

46:46.637 --> 46:49.139
-Before that.
-What's with the hat?

46:50.974 --> 46:53.310
Not hat. Beret.

46:54.728 --> 46:55.771
Blue beret.

46:56.563 --> 46:59.983
You know it better than anyone,
don't you, George?

47:00.108 --> 47:01.318
Huh?

47:01.652 --> 47:03.028
This morning, I had a thought.

47:03.570 --> 47:06.365
Not my thought. Voice in my head.

47:07.407 --> 47:08.700
It was you!

47:08.784 --> 47:10.118
-Me?
-CONSTANCE: Yeah.

47:10.202 --> 47:13.539
Telling me to buy this stupid beret,
making me want to buy it.

47:13.914 --> 47:16.041
So I go to Stonetown to investigate.

47:16.124 --> 47:19.211
-You went to Stonetown? How?
-CONSTANCE: It does not matter.

47:19.878 --> 47:21.046
What matters...

47:21.964 --> 47:24.967
blue berets on everyone.

47:25.050 --> 47:27.302
Berets were listed in Curtain's journal,

47:27.386 --> 47:30.681
but why is Curtain telling people
to buy a blue beret?

47:31.849 --> 47:35.269
The berets are just a dry run.
He's just getting his feet wet.

47:35.853 --> 47:38.188
They're not subliminal
suggestions anymore.

47:38.272 --> 47:39.481
They're commands.

47:39.565 --> 47:40.899
Straight into the coconut.

47:41.191 --> 47:42.901
Textbook mind control.

47:42.985 --> 47:46.196
And not just of Stonetown,
of the whole world.

47:48.574 --> 47:50.158
Let's go. Right now.

47:50.242 --> 47:51.285
STICKY: Wait.

47:52.327 --> 47:54.288
If the Whisperer is that powerful,

47:54.371 --> 47:56.248
we could put good thoughts
into people's heads.

47:56.665 --> 47:57.708
Make them feel happy.

47:57.791 --> 48:00.544
Sticky, you're not thinking straight.
You're not yourself.

48:00.627 --> 48:02.754
I'm more myself than I ever have been.

48:03.005 --> 48:04.131
I'm finally happy.

48:04.214 --> 48:05.632
Thank you, cult.

48:05.716 --> 48:07.634
-Shut up! I'm sick of you!
-REYNIE: Sticky!

48:08.552 --> 48:10.596
I've never heard you talk
to anyone like that.

48:10.679 --> 48:13.682
-She doesn't believe in anything.
-I pity you.

48:13.765 --> 48:15.225
We don't have time for this, Reynie.

48:15.309 --> 48:16.310
-Leave him behind.
-No!

48:16.393 --> 48:18.312
No one gets left behind,

48:18.395 --> 48:20.355
especially when they're not
thinking straight.

48:20.439 --> 48:22.691
Oh, I'm not thinking straight?

48:22.774 --> 48:24.610
I'm the only one here who is thinking!

48:24.693 --> 48:26.612
Fine! You wanna hash things out?

48:26.695 --> 48:28.238
Go ahead. I've got work to do.

48:30.324 --> 48:31.575
REYNIE: Kate!

48:31.658 --> 48:33.911
Wait! You can't do it alone!

49:47.401 --> 49:53.365
not while we're living
