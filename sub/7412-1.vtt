02:08.333 --> 02:12.042
- I hope those lines hold.
- Hold on. Hold on, Wilbur.

02:20.613 --> 02:22.444
Hold on to the wheel.

02:38.613 --> 02:40.604
I'm sick.

02:55.013 --> 02:58.244
- Shut that window, Wilbur.
- All right, I'm trying.

02:58.693 --> 03:00.763
I'll help you, Wilbur.

03:01.293 --> 03:03.249
Mike, look out.

03:03.893 --> 03:06.088
Bloody hell.
Get her below, or I'll kill her.

03:06.253 --> 03:07.627
- Hey, I was...
- I'm telling you!

03:07.693 --> 03:09.365
Get her... Get her out of here!

03:09.533 --> 03:11.683
- Get below!
- I'm going.

03:11.853 --> 03:14.731
I don't understand you.
I'm going down now.

03:15.693 --> 03:17.206
Get below.

03:38.373 --> 03:40.807
Oh, God, not that.

03:49.293 --> 03:52.251
What a hell of a way
to spend New Year's Eve.

04:07.533 --> 04:09.205
How did you even
find someone like that?

04:09.373 --> 04:12.331
Mike, I told you,
I didn't find her, she found me.

04:12.493 --> 04:14.404
She saved my ass
the other night in a bar.

04:14.573 --> 04:16.803
Two guys were trying to roll me,
and she comes up...

04:16.973 --> 04:18.928
and hits one over the head
with a bottle...

04:19.093 --> 04:22.130
and the other one, she just kicked
in that spot where it hurts most.

04:22.293 --> 04:24.443
You should've seen her.
You should've been there.

04:24.613 --> 04:27.173
It's okay, it's okay.
I caught her act last night.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.403
Well, it could've been worse.

04:29.573 --> 04:32.690
Remember that spider monkey
I brought aboard last year?

04:32.853 --> 04:34.081
Sorry.

04:34.253 --> 04:37.131
The only difference so far
is the real monkey didn't apologize.

04:40.173 --> 04:41.765
Morning.

04:42.253 --> 04:44.130
- Here.
- Good morning.

04:44.293 --> 04:45.885
Good morning.

04:46.613 --> 04:49.366
Hey, look, I'm really sorry
about last night.

04:49.533 --> 04:51.524
Usually I'm totally terrific on boats.

04:55.133 --> 04:57.772
- What's this supposed to be?
- Coffee.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.725
Try again.

05:01.693 --> 05:05.288
Listen, ace, it's not exactly
the Waldorf down there.

05:05.453 --> 05:07.808
Mine's okay, Mike.
At least it's hot.

05:07.973 --> 05:09.122
Try again.

05:10.133 --> 05:12.567
If I'd known I was gonna be
sailing with Captain Bligh...

05:12.733 --> 05:15.247
I'd have stayed put
up in my chateau in the Riviera.

05:15.413 --> 05:18.405
Chateau? Is that what
the other girls called it?

05:18.573 --> 05:21.212
Hey, wait a minute.
Now, that's untrue and totally unfair.

05:21.373 --> 05:23.270
- And absolutely, totally...
- I'm sorry, hon.

05:23.333 --> 05:24.607
I really am sorry.

05:24.773 --> 05:27.207
Yeah. I can see you are.

05:27.373 --> 05:28.886
That's okay.

05:33.973 --> 05:35.964
She's a good kid, Mike.
Really, she is.

05:36.133 --> 05:37.646
She's just trying to get to Africa.

05:37.813 --> 05:39.644
I know, I know.

05:39.813 --> 05:44.170
But it'd be so much nicer if somehow
all of this was someone's fault.

05:44.333 --> 05:47.769
Come on now. When we get back
to Marseille, you're going to the bank.

05:47.933 --> 05:50.606
You'll extend the mortgage on the boat,
that's what you'll do.

05:50.773 --> 05:54.083
Mike, losing your cargo in a storm
like that, the bank will understand.

05:54.253 --> 05:55.971
Oh, sure.

05:56.333 --> 05:58.324
In times of real trouble...

05:58.493 --> 06:01.053
one thing a man can depend on
is the sympathy of a bank.

06:01.213 --> 06:02.362
Come on, now.

06:03.693 --> 06:05.524
Hey, take a look up there.

06:06.013 --> 06:07.685
Chopper, right?

06:09.173 --> 06:10.970
French coast guard.

06:17.773 --> 06:21.561
For them to be out this far,
some ship must be in big trouble.

06:27.173 --> 06:29.084
What am I thinking, Wilbur?

06:29.253 --> 06:31.369
- Tell me.
- Salvage.

06:31.533 --> 06:34.047
- You're thinking salvage.
- Salvage, hell.

06:34.213 --> 06:35.885
Salvation.

06:36.053 --> 06:38.886
Some poor devil is stranded out there.

06:39.053 --> 06:42.728
Get a fix on that chopper's course and
we'll follow it back where it came from.

06:42.893 --> 06:46.203
I knew it.
I knew my luck couldn't be that bad.

06:47.013 --> 06:49.766
Nothing was gonna get worse,
because nothing could've.

06:50.893 --> 06:53.726
- Sorry.
- Jesus.

06:58.133 --> 06:59.646
Look what I found.

06:59.813 --> 07:01.610
- Happy New Year.
- I'll drink to that.

07:46.253 --> 07:47.242
Oh, my gosh.

07:48.573 --> 07:51.167
- All those people.
- Yeah, it's a lousy business...

07:51.333 --> 07:54.370
when someone's gotta die
before you can make a buck.

07:54.533 --> 07:56.012
But, you know...

07:56.173 --> 07:59.245
all that salvage is gonna belong
to somebody. Why not us?

07:59.413 --> 08:02.564
I hate to be this big party pooper,
but aren't we slightly overmatched?

08:02.733 --> 08:04.627
This thing's gonna get a double hernia

08:04.628 --> 08:06.521
trying to haul that
thing back into shore.

08:06.693 --> 08:07.728
We don't have to.

08:07.893 --> 08:10.532
Not if the French coast guard
found a way in.

08:13.653 --> 08:16.008
You're looking at
a four-star passenger liner...

08:16.773 --> 08:20.209
carrying hundreds of wealthy people
on a European cruise.

08:20.853 --> 08:22.691
The only kind of salvage I want out of

08:22.692 --> 08:24.528
there is the kind I
can carry on my back.

08:24.693 --> 08:27.605
And end up with what? A bagful of
credit cards and gold fillings?

08:27.773 --> 08:28.842
Charming.

08:29.013 --> 08:31.527
A quick trip down
to the purser's office.

08:31.853 --> 08:34.413
That's where the money
and the jewels are.

08:34.573 --> 08:36.609
Maybe even some gold.

08:36.972 --> 08:38.611
In and out and I'll be on my way back.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.531
That was an explosion inside the hull.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.570
Maybe it's trying to tell you something.

08:49.733 --> 08:50.751
Mike.

08:50.752 --> 08:52.369
I gotta get in there
before it goes down.

08:52.433 --> 08:54.367
I don't know, she could go down
any moment now.

08:54.533 --> 08:56.683
The <i>Andrea Doria</i> stayed up
for more than 10 hours.

08:56.853 --> 08:59.162
Well, I stayed up for a week once.
So what?

08:59.333 --> 09:01.289
We're wasting time.

09:01.813 --> 09:05.965
Now, listen,
I'm going in there by myself.

09:06.133 --> 09:08.408
They're about to take my ship
away from me...

09:08.573 --> 09:11.690
but I've got this chance,
and I'm sure as hell gonna take it.

09:12.613 --> 09:14.729
There could be a fortune in there.

09:15.173 --> 09:16.526
And if there is, it's mine.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.452
Wilbur...

09:19.693 --> 09:21.524
make ready the skiff.

09:21.693 --> 09:23.331
- Get the monkey to help you.
- Monkey?

09:23.493 --> 09:25.324
I didn't know you guys had
a monkey aboard.

09:25.493 --> 09:27.131
Gee, I didn't see one...

09:28.973 --> 09:30.247
Wonderful.

09:34.533 --> 09:37.923
<i>- Ahoy,</i> Jenny <i>, ahoy.</i>
- We've got company.

10:02.253 --> 10:05.882
I'm Dr. Stefan Svevo, and this is
the medical rescue ship <i>Irene</i>.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.333
That must be the <i>Poseidon</i>.
We heard her S.O.S. Last night.

10:09.493 --> 10:11.808
Sheer off. I have the
salvage rights here.

10:11.809 --> 10:14.123
Captain Michael Turner.

10:14.293 --> 10:16.529
A capsized ship is like
a giant air bubble,

10:16.530 --> 10:18.764
captain, and there may be survivors.

10:18.933 --> 10:21.606
My paramedics and I could be
instrumental in guiding them off.

10:21.773 --> 10:23.832
Give them medical
attention, if needed.

10:23.833 --> 10:25.891
The survivors have been taken out.

10:26.053 --> 10:28.362
But you can look
and take out any you find.

10:28.533 --> 10:30.091
But only survivors.

10:30.253 --> 10:32.091
I will take out anything
else that I find.

10:32.092 --> 10:33.928
Is that understood?

10:34.093 --> 10:36.766
Well, that was my original
proposition to you, captain.

10:36.933 --> 10:38.127
Good.

10:38.293 --> 10:41.763
Then we'll start getting our gear
together, and I suggest you do the same.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.924
Well, we are prepared
to go aboard right now...

10:44.093 --> 10:45.924
but, don't worry,
captain, we'll wait.

11:10.093 --> 11:11.685
Sorry, not a chance.

11:11.853 --> 11:13.411
Way I see it,
you don't have a choice.

11:13.573 --> 11:14.562
How's that?

11:14.733 --> 11:18.408
As I said, I'm in a desperate need
to get to North Africa.

11:18.573 --> 11:21.804
You leave me here and sail off without
me, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

11:21.973 --> 11:24.487
Wilbur, we're gonna tie her up
and throw her in the tug.

11:24.653 --> 11:26.405
If you don't come back,
I'll die up here.

11:26.573 --> 11:29.133
- That is a definite possibility.
- Oh, come off it, Turner.

11:29.293 --> 11:31.887
I know you're a tough guy,
but you're not a son of a bitch...

11:32.053 --> 11:35.841
no matter how bad you want me
to think you are, are you?

11:36.013 --> 11:37.128
Sit down.

11:40.013 --> 11:42.004
- Ready?
- Yeah.

12:26.813 --> 12:28.690
I hope you're a religious man, captain.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.847
I've taken the liberty of saying
a small prayer for us.

12:32.013 --> 12:33.002
All of us?

12:33.173 --> 12:36.643
Well, it's my feeling that
from this time on...

12:36.813 --> 12:39.646
our fates are
necessarily intertwined.

12:39.813 --> 12:41.485
Good, then you won't be offended...

12:41.653 --> 12:45.123
if I remind you
of that fact from time to time.

12:48.933 --> 12:52.164
The French coast guard
must have cut a hole in the ship.

13:48.333 --> 13:51.211
Skipper, I'm telling you,
it's a floating time bomb.

13:51.373 --> 13:54.126
Hazards of the trade. Let's go.

14:19.613 --> 14:21.126
Hold it.

14:24.013 --> 14:26.049
We've gotta find a way down.

14:29.293 --> 14:30.806
Like over there, maybe.

14:30.973 --> 14:33.168
- Where?
- There.

14:53.333 --> 14:54.971
Take a look, Wilbur.

14:55.133 --> 14:56.771
This will do.

14:59.093 --> 15:01.926
Yeah, this'll do it. Come on.

15:16.133 --> 15:17.805
Here, this way.

15:58.013 --> 16:01.892
It's the escape hatch
for the engine-room crew.

16:07.813 --> 16:09.531
Coming, monkey?

16:10.453 --> 16:12.091
Why not?

17:33.453 --> 17:35.489
Where are we?

17:39.213 --> 17:42.250
- Looks like a mess.
- It's the gym.

17:57.773 --> 17:58.922
Just hold on and help him.

17:59.133 --> 18:02.170
- What happened?
- The ventilators collapsed.

18:14.573 --> 18:16.723
- You got him?
- I got him.

18:16.933 --> 18:18.446
Come on.

18:36.333 --> 18:39.052
Come on, you can make it.

18:59.533 --> 19:02.172
- How is he?
- He'll be all right.

19:11.613 --> 19:14.366
- Is everyone else all right?
- I'm fine.

19:16.093 --> 19:18.732
Okay, we're locked in.
No way of getting out there now.

19:18.893 --> 19:21.612
Sure there is. There must be
another entrance into that engine...

19:25.733 --> 19:28.486
What's so funny, doctor?
Let us in on it.

19:28.853 --> 19:31.208
I'm sure we could all use
a good laugh right about now.

19:31.373 --> 19:33.523
I find it ironic, that's all, captain...

19:33.693 --> 19:37.083
that I've suddenly become one of the
very people I came down here to rescue.

19:38.293 --> 19:42.366
Doctor, that little prayer you said
for all of us up there...

19:42.533 --> 19:45.206
what sort of religion
would that happen to be?

19:45.973 --> 19:47.042
Greek Orthodox.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.005
Greek Orthodox. No kidding?

19:49.173 --> 19:50.891
I'm a Greek Orthodox too...

19:51.053 --> 19:52.202
suddenly.

20:13.773 --> 20:15.923
Wilbur, switch the steam off.

20:21.373 --> 20:22.726
Over here.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.208
- Are you the rescue team?
- We used to be.

20:36.373 --> 20:39.285
Last night was the worst
New Year's party I've ever been to.

20:39.453 --> 20:41.489
I mean, everything turns upside down.

20:42.333 --> 20:44.130
What a party. What a night.

20:44.293 --> 20:46.249
Look, I lost my daughter.

20:46.413 --> 20:49.849
- You gotta help me find my daughter.
- Calm down, mister. Just calm down.

20:50.013 --> 20:51.651
I'm Captain Mike Turner...

20:51.813 --> 20:54.691
and I have the salvage rights
to this wreck.

20:55.333 --> 20:57.927
Now, who are you people?

20:58.093 --> 21:00.971
I'm Gina Rowe, the ship's nurse.

21:01.133 --> 21:06.287
It all happened so quickly.
We never knew what happened.

21:06.453 --> 21:08.444
- Any other survivors?
- There couldn't be.

21:08.613 --> 21:10.888
We can't be sure of that, Suzanne.

21:11.053 --> 21:14.363
Mr. Mazzetti,
Suzanne and myself...

21:14.533 --> 21:16.808
we were following
some other passengers...

21:16.973 --> 21:18.850
and we got separated from them...

21:19.013 --> 21:22.403
and we stumbled into the steam room.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.643
It looked like a safe
place, at the time.

21:24.813 --> 21:27.725
- It was until that pipe broke.
- Look, forget the pipe.

21:27.893 --> 21:30.327
Help me find my daughter,
I'll give you everything I got.

21:30.493 --> 21:31.562
Understand? Everything.

21:31.733 --> 21:34.805
Let's just get it out of here, okay?
Which way, captain?

21:34.973 --> 21:37.203
We were hoping
you'd give us the answer.

21:38.773 --> 21:40.968
Oh, my God.

21:43.333 --> 21:46.564
The rest of your crew, they're
on their way down here right now?

21:47.293 --> 21:48.806
No.

21:48.973 --> 21:51.043
Those two over there are my crew.

21:51.213 --> 21:52.612
All of it.

21:53.173 --> 21:55.403
- Just the three of you?
- That's right.

21:55.573 --> 21:57.928
What, did you come by canoe?

21:59.053 --> 22:01.692
You, what are you doing down here?

22:01.853 --> 22:03.684
I'm Dr. Stefan Svevo, Mr. Mazzetti...

22:03.853 --> 22:05.923
and I've been asking myself
that same question.

22:06.093 --> 22:07.651
Oh, my God.

22:07.813 --> 22:09.644
My daughter, she hated this trip.

22:09.813 --> 22:11.804
She wanted to stay home
for Christmas.

22:11.973 --> 22:15.602
I said, "Honey, I want you to see
where I fought the war in Italy. Anzio."

22:15.773 --> 22:18.412
Anzio? I've been to Anzio.

22:18.573 --> 22:19.688
Anzio's the pits.

22:19.853 --> 22:22.162
- You sound just like my daughter.
- Easy, Mazzetti.

22:23.373 --> 22:25.284
How well do you know this ship, Gina?

22:25.453 --> 22:28.809
Hardly at all. It's my first voyage.

22:29.653 --> 22:32.804
Well, there must be a deck plan
around here somewhere.

22:33.293 --> 22:35.045
There's always one in every section.

22:35.213 --> 22:37.124
Look, I used the gym a couple of times.

22:37.293 --> 22:39.807
Seems like there's a deck plan
in the lobby over there.

22:39.973 --> 22:41.042
The ladies stay here.

22:41.213 --> 22:44.011
The rest of you,
help me find a deck plan.

22:44.573 --> 22:46.404
Through here.

22:50.053 --> 22:53.443
- I guess I was wrong.
- There it is.

22:58.253 --> 22:59.368
We're here.

22:59.533 --> 23:01.649
Here it is. Here it is.

23:02.453 --> 23:03.647
We found it.

23:03.813 --> 23:06.088
- You found a way out?
- No.

23:06.253 --> 23:08.528
But we found the purser's office.

23:09.413 --> 23:11.768
You're a very single-minded man,
captain.

23:11.933 --> 23:14.891
- And some would say callously so.
- Watch out.

23:18.213 --> 23:21.285
The way I see it, doctor,
is that we're all trapped here anyway...

23:21.453 --> 23:24.650
so I see no reason not to try
and get what I originally came for.

23:24.813 --> 23:26.087
Here.

23:26.493 --> 23:29.929
Look, forget the purser's office.
I gotta find my kid.

23:30.773 --> 23:32.172
Mazzetti!

23:41.453 --> 23:44.604
- Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know.
- Neither did I.

23:44.773 --> 23:46.206
Okay, so I was stupid.

23:46.373 --> 23:49.126
But somebody's gotta do something.
We just can't sit around.

23:49.293 --> 23:52.012
Look, she's alive, I know it.
I can feel it.

23:52.173 --> 23:55.210
Fine. Then you tell us where she is,
and we'll all go look for her.

23:57.773 --> 24:00.333
- I don't know.
- Then shut up and calm down.

24:00.493 --> 24:03.212
We have as good a chance
of finding your daughter or way out...

24:03.373 --> 24:05.489
by heading for the purser's office
as anywhere.

24:05.653 --> 24:09.123
And that is through there.
Now let's go.

24:12.373 --> 24:15.171
After you, skipper. Come on.

24:15.693 --> 24:18.526
Keep on moving, that's my philosophy.

24:21.813 --> 24:24.168
I really don't see
that there's any alternative.

24:24.813 --> 24:26.644
We're putting our faith in you, captain.

24:26.813 --> 24:28.485
What, you're putting your faith in him?

24:28.653 --> 24:31.042
An hour ago, he's sunbathing
up there on the poop deck.

24:31.213 --> 24:33.010
Now he's down
in this underwater coffin...

24:33.173 --> 24:35.687
trapped with the rest of us,
that's how smart he is.

24:36.733 --> 24:38.086
You.

24:38.253 --> 24:41.325
You haven't come forward yet.
You look like a reasonable man.

24:42.093 --> 24:43.685
What do you say we throw in together?

24:43.853 --> 24:46.128
We'll find my daughter
and get the hell out of here.

24:46.293 --> 24:48.488
May I see the deck plan, please?

24:53.453 --> 24:57.731
Well, I'm afraid my knowledge
of ships and underwater conditions...

24:57.893 --> 24:59.884
falls far short of Captain Turner's.

25:00.173 --> 25:04.166
But I am flattered, Mr. Mazzetti,
that you'd feel safer being with me.

25:04.333 --> 25:08.611
But at the moment, at least, I'd feel
much safer being with the captain.

25:08.853 --> 25:12.129
And, captain, I'm at your service.

25:14.253 --> 25:17.689
Well, I don't seem
to have a choice anymore, do I?

25:23.973 --> 25:26.885
By the way, Mazzetti,
what rank were you in the war?

25:27.053 --> 25:30.045
If it's any of your business,
master sergeant.

25:30.213 --> 25:33.762
Good. Then you'll be used
to taking orders from captains.

25:33.933 --> 25:36.686
Move it out, sarge.

26:31.493 --> 26:33.006
Here it is, the purser's office.

26:41.533 --> 26:43.012
Wilbur.

26:43.693 --> 26:45.126
Take this...

26:45.293 --> 26:47.488
and hold those wires back.

26:48.693 --> 26:51.332
Do you ladies think
you could jump this?

26:55.613 --> 26:59.492
Well, it can't be more
than 6 or 7 feet across.

26:59.693 --> 27:01.923
When I was the captain
of my college track team...

27:02.093 --> 27:05.608
often times, you know,
we'd dig this pit...

27:06.493 --> 27:08.848
Well, it can't be
much of a jump, can it?

27:08.849 --> 27:11.203
Speak for yourself.

27:12.133 --> 27:16.445
When I was in the Girl Scouts, I once
won a medal for the running broad jump.

27:16.613 --> 27:20.162
How many tries they give you?
Best of three?

27:28.813 --> 27:30.087
Show them how it's done, Gina.

27:30.813 --> 27:31.802
Take a run at it.

27:33.053 --> 27:34.406
Look, if you miss, Gina...

27:34.573 --> 27:36.643
Mr. Mazzetti, would you
hold that for me, please?

27:36.813 --> 27:39.202
Please, call me Frankie.

27:43.093 --> 27:44.651
Take a run.

27:49.253 --> 27:50.527
All right, Gina.

27:50.893 --> 27:53.282
Come on, sarge, join us.

27:53.573 --> 27:56.041
Don't worry about me, Turner.

28:03.413 --> 28:06.086
- My dress. I don't think I can make it.
- Take it off.

28:06.533 --> 28:08.285
- I beg your pardon?
- Take it off.

28:08.453 --> 28:11.525
He's got a real way with words,
doesn't he?

28:11.893 --> 28:15.090
- With apologies, madame. Givenchy?
- It's a copy, actually.

28:17.813 --> 28:20.281
Should we be fortunate enough
to get out of here alive...

28:20.453 --> 28:23.047
I'd be very happy to replace it
with the real thing.

28:29.293 --> 28:32.126
- Oh, God, hold me, please.
- Oh, brother.

28:32.733 --> 28:34.291
I'm okay.

28:35.573 --> 28:38.007
- Are you gonna be all right?
- As soon as you make it. Go.

28:38.173 --> 28:39.970
Well, I can't, Wilbur, I can't.

28:40.133 --> 28:42.567
I can't make this jump
unless you're on the other side...

28:42.733 --> 28:44.724
Shut up, the pair of you,
and one of you jump.

28:44.893 --> 28:47.532
- Right. Wilbur.
- Hold the wires back for him.

29:06.053 --> 29:07.042
Come on.

29:15.053 --> 29:17.692
Just a minute. Take a run.

29:17.853 --> 29:19.730
- Okay.
- Okay.

29:22.053 --> 29:25.011
- I have the shortest legs of any of us.
- Shut up and come now!

29:25.173 --> 29:27.164
- Okay, here I come. Are you ready?
- Yes.

29:27.333 --> 29:28.766
Okay.

29:37.133 --> 29:39.044
That's a hell of a track team
you belonged to.

29:39.213 --> 29:40.851
Actually, my specialty was the discus.

29:41.013 --> 29:42.890
- Get out of here.
- I was good at the discus.

29:48.173 --> 29:49.891
The safe, do you see?

29:55.653 --> 29:58.042
- Coming, doctor?
- Well, I've been thinking, captain.

29:58.973 --> 30:00.611
We'll separate into two camps.

30:00.773 --> 30:02.252
We'll go aft...

30:02.413 --> 30:04.165
and you and your party
continue forward.

30:04.333 --> 30:05.766
Is that an order?

30:05.933 --> 30:08.652
Hopefully it's a
constructive suggestion.

30:10.053 --> 30:14.251
All right, doctor,
we'll play it your way.

30:23.733 --> 30:25.132
Hey, look, we're wasting time.

30:25.293 --> 30:27.329
This ship could blow up
or go down any second.

30:27.493 --> 30:28.608
We gotta find my daughter.

30:28.773 --> 30:30.365
- She could be anywhere.
- Mike.

30:30.533 --> 30:32.569
Look, she's not here.
Let's look somewhere else.

30:32.733 --> 30:34.564
- Think we need the plastique?
- I don't know.

30:35.213 --> 30:37.488
- Did you ever live with a safe cracker?
- Absolutely.

30:37.653 --> 30:39.245
Of course, I didn't know at the time.

30:39.413 --> 30:41.210
She's not in the safe,
I can tell you that.

30:51.853 --> 30:54.083
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

30:54.253 --> 30:57.404
That's okay, Mike, don't worry
about me. I'm just fine too.

31:11.573 --> 31:13.928
Well, what do you know.

31:14.093 --> 31:16.891
Now, that's one way to crack a safe.

31:20.973 --> 31:25.251
- Where do you think you're going?
- Let's not wait around for the cops.

32:02.733 --> 32:05.293
- 1796.
- How much you think they're worth?

32:05.453 --> 32:07.728
A hundred times its weight in gold.

32:09.893 --> 32:10.882
Bort.

32:11.053 --> 32:12.771
- What?
- Bort.

32:12.933 --> 32:14.491
- What's that?
- Industrial diamonds.

32:14.653 --> 32:15.688
How much are they worth?

32:15.853 --> 32:18.731
Oh, I'd say 3 to 400,000 dollars' worth.

32:21.093 --> 32:23.846
Now, wait a minute.
Tell me the truth, is this really ours?

32:24.013 --> 32:25.571
Yeah, the law of salvage.

32:25.733 --> 32:28.167
Pack up and let's get out of here.

32:28.333 --> 32:32.326
Can you see us now, Mike? Can you
see us along the Riviera now, huh?

32:32.493 --> 32:33.642
Why, we're rich.

32:33.813 --> 32:37.886
You know what? We don't need
a bank anymore, do we, huh?

32:38.053 --> 32:41.443
No bank for us anymore.
We're filthy, stinking...

32:41.613 --> 32:43.524
Great, great. So you're all rich.

32:48.053 --> 32:49.327
Puke, son.

32:49.493 --> 32:54.806
That's fine Saint-Emilion, 19 and 61.

32:58.333 --> 33:01.769
Whole ship's rocking pretty bad,
ain't it, captain?

33:03.893 --> 33:05.770
How you doing, Tex?

33:05.933 --> 33:11.963
Well, I gotta confess,
I've had smoother crossings in my day.

33:13.293 --> 33:17.923
Name's Dewey Hopkins.
I'm from Big D, Texas.

33:18.893 --> 33:21.088
That's Dallas, folks.

33:22.173 --> 33:25.848
With your permission, captain,
I'd like to buy the house a round.

33:26.013 --> 33:29.608
Much obliged, Tex, but we're here
on a pretty tricky, salvage operation.

33:30.133 --> 33:33.330
I'm Captain Mike Turner,
this here's Wilbur and Celeste, my crew.

33:33.493 --> 33:35.165
- How you doing?
- Pleased to meet you.

33:35.333 --> 33:37.642
Tell you what, Captain Mike.

33:38.013 --> 33:41.892
You just salvaged yours truly
out of this here wreck.

33:42.053 --> 33:44.613
There's 100,000 in it for your trouble.

33:44.773 --> 33:46.411
I can't take your money, Tex.

33:46.573 --> 33:47.892
Anyway, I don't need it now.

33:49.613 --> 33:53.447
Well, as one man of substance
to another, let's go right to the mat.

33:53.613 --> 33:58.084
I mean, let's not pussyfoot around.

33:58.253 --> 34:01.404
A hundred and fifty thousand
for the three of us.

34:04.053 --> 34:05.042
They're with me.

34:06.573 --> 34:07.847
There's nobody there, sport.

34:08.013 --> 34:10.243
- You're seeing double.
- Triple, maybe.

34:10.413 --> 34:12.608
They must've got lost.

34:13.973 --> 34:15.645
Hey!

34:16.213 --> 34:18.090
Hey, come on out here, y'all...

34:18.893 --> 34:20.804
and get yourselves rescued.

34:23.652 --> 34:28.168
- Theresa! Theresa!
- Daddy.

34:31.013 --> 34:32.492
Oh, thank God.

34:32.813 --> 34:34.405
Thank you.

34:37.092 --> 34:39.322
- Would somebody catch this, please?
- My baby.

34:40.693 --> 34:42.364
Thank God.

34:45.132 --> 34:47.362
- Thank you.
- I didn't think I'd see you again.

34:47.533 --> 34:48.966
I love you, baby.

34:51.293 --> 34:54.045
He knew she was alive somewhere.
He just knew it.

34:55.013 --> 34:57.527
- Oh, my baby.
- Daddy, this is Larry Simpson.

34:57.693 --> 34:59.046
He saved my life.

34:59.213 --> 35:03.206
I was coming down in the elevator
and the ship turned over.

35:03.373 --> 35:04.886
- I was operating it.
- My baby.

35:05.053 --> 35:07.189
We tried to get out,
but the passageway was on fire.

35:07.253 --> 35:10.211
I fainted, but he pulled me out.

35:10.373 --> 35:12.648
My baby. Look, look, kid, I...

35:12.813 --> 35:14.405
I'm never gonna forget you for this.

35:20.613 --> 35:24.083
Here, here. Your dress is torn.

35:26.293 --> 35:28.363
All right, folks...

35:28.533 --> 35:31.366
let's wet ourselves down
for safety's sake...

35:31.533 --> 35:34.366
and get this herd
on the road for home.

35:34.533 --> 35:35.761
Here.

35:38.533 --> 35:39.727
Wrong year?

35:39.893 --> 35:41.246
Wrong time, Tex.

35:43.053 --> 35:45.613
All right, now, we've found
what we wanted.

35:45.773 --> 35:48.810
Each one of you fill a bag
with gold or diamonds and carry it out.

35:48.973 --> 35:51.009
Everyone gets 10 percent
of what they carry.

35:51.173 --> 35:52.401
Diamonds.

35:52.573 --> 35:54.882
Look, we don't want
your filthy loot around our necks.

35:55.053 --> 35:56.805
Just get us the hell out of here.

35:57.613 --> 36:01.162
Well, perhaps just a few.

36:48.813 --> 36:52.089
Ten percent of this will pay off
the balance on my folks' farm.

36:52.253 --> 36:53.686
Maybe buy me one too.

36:53.853 --> 36:57.004
- You, a farmer?
- I will be if I get out of here alive.

36:57.173 --> 36:59.209
Look here, Mr. Hopkins.

36:59.373 --> 37:01.807
We've all gotta have
our wits about us from now on...

37:01.973 --> 37:05.443
so as they say in Dallas,
drop the bottle, Tex.

37:05.613 --> 37:08.650
What I'm a-holding here means
more to me than...

37:08.813 --> 37:11.885
any two bags of that trash
you got there, captain.

37:12.213 --> 37:16.286
Why this is a original Beaune, 1865.

37:17.133 --> 37:20.330
Maybe only six of them left
in the whole world.

37:20.493 --> 37:24.327
Now I'd a whole lot rather drink it
out in the daylight...

37:24.533 --> 37:26.410
but one way or another...

37:26.573 --> 37:29.451
it's a pleasure no man's
gonna deprive me of.

37:31.213 --> 37:32.805
All right, Tex.

37:33.453 --> 37:36.684
If disaster strikes, I'll try and
give you a couple of minutes warning.

37:39.373 --> 37:40.601
Okay, everybody, let's...

37:43.053 --> 37:44.042
Where's Suzanne?

37:47.133 --> 37:49.852
- Probably in the powder room.
- Suzanne?

37:51.533 --> 37:53.125
Suzanne?

37:54.893 --> 37:56.372
Suzanne?

37:56.613 --> 37:58.524
Suzanne?

37:59.613 --> 38:01.126
She's gone, Mike.

38:01.573 --> 38:04.007
- What do you mean, gone?
- Gone. Split. Disappeared.

38:04.173 --> 38:06.528
She could've gone off with Svevo.
Who knows why?

38:06.693 --> 38:08.012
I sure wish I did.

38:08.173 --> 38:10.289
Hazards of the trade, kid.
Hazards of the trade.

38:10.453 --> 38:12.444
Anyone else feel safer with Svevo?

38:13.653 --> 38:14.881
Who's Svevo?

38:15.053 --> 38:18.011
As a matter of fact,
who the devil's Suzanne?

38:18.173 --> 38:19.891
All right, let's go, then.

38:20.333 --> 38:23.405
- Mike.
- That's a beautiful bottle.

38:23.853 --> 38:26.128
That's a beautiful bottle of wine.

38:26.293 --> 38:27.792
- Actually...
- Young lady, let me...

38:27.853 --> 38:31.528
Actually, sir, you know, I much prefer
a Château Haut-Brion, '50s and '60s.

38:31.693 --> 38:33.690
Odd years. It doesn't
really have the bite,

38:33.691 --> 38:35.686
but I much prefer the body, you know?

38:35.853 --> 38:37.127
I surely do.

38:37.293 --> 38:39.682
- Young lady, I most certainly do.
- Yeah.

38:39.853 --> 38:41.172
You ever been to Texas?

38:41.333 --> 38:45.121
No, not I myself. But I had a
great-granddaddy who died at the Alamo.

38:45.293 --> 38:46.567
- The Alamo?
- Yeah.

38:46.733 --> 38:48.644
- Well, do tell.
- Yeah.

38:48.813 --> 38:51.281
- Hey, monkey, come on.
- Yeah. Coming.

38:51.613 --> 38:53.012
Stefan?

39:05.693 --> 39:07.331
Stefan?

39:13.293 --> 39:14.885
Stefan?

39:17.493 --> 39:19.688
Oh, thank God.

39:21.133 --> 39:22.964
Well, doctor...

39:23.693 --> 39:26.253
aren't you even going to say hello?

39:34.093 --> 39:35.526
Here.

39:38.413 --> 39:40.353
Stefan, I'm petrified.
Please, can we just

39:40.354 --> 39:42.292
get out of here as
quickly as possible?

39:42.453 --> 39:44.648
It took two years
to put this thing together.

39:44.813 --> 39:48.249
I mean, do you really believe
I can get off without it?

39:48.413 --> 39:50.085
I've done everything you wanted.

39:50.253 --> 39:51.686
And now I just want to get out.

39:54.253 --> 39:55.572
I...

39:56.253 --> 39:57.447
I understand.

39:59.213 --> 40:02.489
Would I have gotten aboard
if I could've avoided it?

40:02.653 --> 40:05.611
But since I'm here,
since we're both here...

40:05.773 --> 40:08.367
we've got to see this thing through.

40:08.533 --> 40:10.171
Besides, I don't have an option, do I?

40:13.013 --> 40:15.925
No, but I do.

40:20.733 --> 40:23.247
Captain Turner,
at least he's looking for a way out.

40:25.093 --> 40:27.482
Well, the choice is yours, Suzanne.

40:27.653 --> 40:29.450
One must do what one must do.

40:32.213 --> 40:34.090
Stefan, I'm sorry.

40:37.653 --> 40:39.405
And I'm sorry too.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.482
- Good luck.
- And you.

40:58.413 --> 40:59.607
Doyle.

41:02.813 --> 41:04.212
Kill her.

41:12.493 --> 41:14.051
Finish her.

41:39.533 --> 41:41.091
Wilbur, is anybody hurt?

41:41.253 --> 41:43.369
Okay up here. Keep moving.

41:47.493 --> 41:48.972
All of you, keep going.

41:49.133 --> 41:50.885
Quick, move down.

42:00.013 --> 42:01.605
Through here.

42:03.653 --> 42:05.723
Quickly, through here.

42:09.013 --> 42:10.571
Wilbur.

42:20.053 --> 42:23.841
Keep going, skipper.
I'll catch up with you.

42:32.093 --> 42:33.492
Mike?

42:35.973 --> 42:38.089
- Mike?
- Coming.

42:42.573 --> 42:44.006
Jesus Christ.

42:44.173 --> 42:46.733
- What should we do?
- Start moving furniture.

42:46.893 --> 42:49.930
All right, all right, let's pitch in.
Come on, kid, give me a hand.

42:50.093 --> 42:53.563
Get the wino to help you.
Nothing personal.

42:54.173 --> 42:57.768
- Move.
- Here, got it.

43:21.133 --> 43:24.170
Wilbur, what's taking so long?

43:27.213 --> 43:28.646
Wilbur?

43:33.333 --> 43:35.324
What do you think you're doing?

43:35.493 --> 43:39.486
- Bag of gold. I lost it.
- The hell with the gold.

43:40.493 --> 43:42.026
- Let's get out here.
- Let me get...

43:42.093 --> 43:43.321
Get out.

43:53.773 --> 43:56.287
You crazy old man, you...

44:01.933 --> 44:03.889
I'm sorry, Wilbur.

44:05.293 --> 44:07.011
Is it that bad?

44:09.453 --> 44:11.489
I'll come along.
Go on up there with the others.

44:11.653 --> 44:12.722
Like hell I will.

44:12.893 --> 44:14.929
I don't want them to see me like this.

44:15.373 --> 44:17.807
Not Celeste, anyway.

44:18.733 --> 44:19.768
It'll pass, Mike.

44:20.573 --> 44:22.130
Believe me, it'll pass.
It always does.

44:22.131 --> 44:23.087
Sure, sure.

44:24.413 --> 44:27.052
I think my body's trying
to tell me something.

44:28.373 --> 44:31.968
You don't have to pretend to me, Wilbur.

44:33.453 --> 44:34.727
I know what you've got.

44:39.373 --> 44:42.251
I've been to see that doctor
you're always sneaking off to.

44:44.973 --> 44:46.770
You went and saw the...?

44:49.333 --> 44:50.561
What's his name?

44:52.653 --> 44:54.166
Bernheim.

45:00.693 --> 45:04.527
Well, I guess there isn't much
we can do about it, is there?

45:04.893 --> 45:06.565
Of course there is, Wilbur.

45:07.053 --> 45:11.092
As of this morning, we have all
the money we need for an operation.

45:14.253 --> 45:18.087
- Do you think you can stand?
- Don't help me.

45:22.693 --> 45:25.571
I can stand better than you...

45:26.013 --> 45:28.083
for an old man.

45:35.053 --> 45:37.362
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
- God.

45:37.533 --> 45:40.570
Mike. Mike.

45:43.053 --> 45:45.692
- Who are you, ma'am?
- I'm Hannah Meredith.

45:52.293 --> 45:54.887
This is my husband, Harold Meredith.

45:55.333 --> 45:58.564
- How do you do?
- It's all right.

45:59.093 --> 46:02.403
You two seem to have taken
all of this very calmly.

46:02.573 --> 46:04.848
I mean, why didn't you try to escape?

46:05.013 --> 46:07.527
In our case, it seemed safer
just to stay right here.

46:07.693 --> 46:09.968
We couldn't risk
being separated outside.

46:10.133 --> 46:12.124
Well, I accept the sentiment, ma'am...

46:12.293 --> 46:15.683
but at this particular point, I strongly
recommend you come along with us.

46:15.853 --> 46:17.764
It'd be very difficult for us
to get out.

46:17.933 --> 46:19.685
Well, I'm gonna
have to tell you, ma'am...

46:19.853 --> 46:21.923
that where we came in is blocked off.

46:22.573 --> 46:25.883
- The explosions.
- That's right, and there could be more.

46:26.533 --> 46:28.330
- I'm staying here.
- No.

46:28.493 --> 46:31.371
Look, I'm not gonna be
a burden to everyone, I...

46:33.533 --> 46:35.091
I'm blind.

46:37.613 --> 46:40.969
I'm not going to leave the cabin
without my husband.

46:41.453 --> 46:44.907
Hannah, if you find a safe way out,
you can come back.

46:44.973 --> 46:46.607
Without me, you'll
have a better chance.

46:46.608 --> 46:47.841
No.

46:48.013 --> 46:50.083
Look, I don't mean to be cruel,
and I'm sorry...

46:50.253 --> 46:52.608
but I think Mr. Meredith here
has a point.

46:52.773 --> 46:54.604
- Daddy!
- Shut up, sarge.

46:54.773 --> 46:56.545
What do you mean?
How much time do we have?

46:56.613 --> 46:58.922
We got an hour?
He'll slow us down.

46:59.093 --> 47:01.402
If it's more than an hour,
I'll come back and get him.

47:01.573 --> 47:04.041
- That's very perverted reasoning.
- Frank, you're a creep.

47:04.493 --> 47:06.563
- You heard Meredith himself talking.
- Shut up.

47:06.733 --> 47:07.961
He'll slow us down.

47:08.133 --> 47:11.569
- I'll be dead. I don't wanna die.
- Shut up. All of you.

47:11.973 --> 47:15.249
They're both coming with us. I leave
a single soul alive on this wreck...

47:15.413 --> 47:17.483
I'll throw out my title
to the salvage rights.

47:17.653 --> 47:19.325
Oh, that's crap, and you know it.

47:19.493 --> 47:21.688
I'd bet it that you would
testify against me.

47:24.413 --> 47:26.085
Now, let's shove off, Meredith.

47:26.253 --> 47:28.448
I'll carry you if I have to.

47:28.653 --> 47:30.928
I can carry my own weight, thank you.

47:39.693 --> 47:41.684
Hey, hey, take it easy, Pops.

47:41.853 --> 47:44.321
Sorry. And it's Harold.

47:44.493 --> 47:46.484
Mind the step, darling.

47:46.653 --> 47:49.804
Everything's different, remember,
because the ship's upside down.

47:49.973 --> 47:54.205
Can you imagine that man talking to me
as though I were a piece of salvage?

47:54.373 --> 47:56.523
You're luckier than you think,
Mr. Meredith.

47:56.693 --> 47:58.206
Salvage is my business.

47:59.373 --> 48:04.606
- I'll walk along with you.
- I'm the ship's nurse.

48:04.933 --> 48:07.401
Let's have another look
at that deck plan.

48:08.373 --> 48:11.604
I think I must have given it
to what's-his-name, Dr. Svevo.

48:11.773 --> 48:13.126
He must still have it.

48:13.293 --> 48:15.363
What the hell were you
ever sergeant of, Mazzetti?

48:15.533 --> 48:17.171
The Lost Patrol?

48:17.333 --> 48:18.652
Come on.

48:37.373 --> 48:40.046
All right, we know what
we're looking for. Let's find it.

48:41.453 --> 48:43.364
This could take hours.

48:43.533 --> 48:45.171
Damn hull could go down at any second.

48:46.053 --> 48:48.487
Unless we get out of here alive,
it's all for nothing.

48:48.653 --> 48:51.008
- I'm gonna find a way out.
- You do what you're told.

48:51.173 --> 48:54.245
I know the way out.
I've got the deck plan.

48:55.693 --> 48:57.331
Doyle's dead.

48:58.253 --> 49:00.403
She killed him with an ax.

49:00.853 --> 49:02.730
There's a trail of blood down
the passageway.

49:02.893 --> 49:05.088
- Should I go after her?
- No, she won't get very far.

49:05.253 --> 49:06.891
I need you here.

49:07.533 --> 49:10.206
The crate is marked Sprague Pumps.
Find it.

49:18.613 --> 49:21.286
Wires. Here.

49:22.213 --> 49:24.443
- Turn sideways.
- Turn sideways.

49:27.293 --> 49:29.124
They're behind you.

49:33.413 --> 49:35.722
There's fire here on the right.

49:50.733 --> 49:53.566
- Why don't you turn this way.
- Hey, we don't need any more help.

49:53.733 --> 49:56.042
- Keep moving.
- Daddy, he's just trying to be nice.

49:56.213 --> 49:58.249
Look, we don't need nice.

49:58.613 --> 50:00.171
Hold it. Hold it.

50:00.333 --> 50:03.325
I smell grub. Hurry on up, folks.

50:03.533 --> 50:06.172
Move on out and I'll lead the way.

50:06.373 --> 50:08.329
Good Lord, Tex.

50:08.493 --> 50:10.484
No place for a foot race.

50:11.813 --> 50:13.166
Hot dang it.

50:13.333 --> 50:15.403
Would you look at this.

50:20.173 --> 50:22.004
Son of a gun. He sniffed it out.

50:22.173 --> 50:25.085
Well, some folks got a nose for water.

50:25.253 --> 50:29.405
Me, I got a nose for food and oil.

50:29.573 --> 50:32.070
You know, bet there's
all kinds of vittles

50:32.071 --> 50:34.567
around here if we wanna look for them.

50:34.973 --> 50:36.452
- Hey, Tex.
- Yeah?

50:36.613 --> 50:40.003
Can that educated nose of yours
tell me where the tunnel leads?

50:40.173 --> 50:42.846
No, sir, captain, it sure can't.

50:43.213 --> 50:46.762
In that case, all of you take a rest
and I'll go find out.

50:46.933 --> 50:48.161
I'm going with you.

50:49.813 --> 50:52.202
I can crawl into smaller places
than you can.

50:52.373 --> 50:53.408
No, monkey.

50:58.773 --> 51:00.650
Thanks, Wilbur.

51:04.973 --> 51:06.531
This way.

51:21.693 --> 51:24.002
- Here. Here.
- Thanks, kid.

51:24.173 --> 51:26.209
Here, get something for yourself.

51:46.213 --> 51:47.202
Look.

52:22.933 --> 52:24.730
It's no use.

52:26.573 --> 52:28.131
It's blocked solid.

52:30.093 --> 52:31.685
We're gonna have to...

52:32.693 --> 52:35.366
Hey, we'll find another way out.

52:35.533 --> 52:38.684
- It's all right. It's simple.
- I know that. I know that.

52:39.373 --> 52:43.730
Can't a person just come in here and
sit down and cry, for goodness' sakes?

52:43.893 --> 52:46.407
I mean, why do you think I wanted
to come in this tunnel?

52:46.573 --> 52:50.805
God, this is not a good day for me.

52:51.253 --> 52:54.848
Honestly, you just don't
understand me at all.

52:55.213 --> 52:56.931
Understand you?

52:57.293 --> 52:59.887
I don't even know who you are.

53:02.013 --> 53:03.412
I'm Celeste Whitman.

53:03.573 --> 53:05.450
- Hi.
- Hello.

53:05.613 --> 53:09.162
I came to France a year and a half ago
with my boyfriend from Cincinnati.

53:09.333 --> 53:11.051
Where's your boyfriend now?

53:11.213 --> 53:13.204
Cincinnati.

53:15.813 --> 53:17.451
How about those
three husbands of yours?

53:17.773 --> 53:20.651
Oh, I was never married.

53:20.813 --> 53:23.850
Of course, I could've been married
if I'd wanted to be, a million times.

53:24.013 --> 53:25.332
Millions and millions of times.

53:25.493 --> 53:28.485
- There's no doubt about that. None.
- There's no doubt about it. None.

53:28.653 --> 53:32.566
I mean, I can do anything that I set my
mind to do, you know? I mean anything.

53:32.733 --> 53:35.850
I have this very high IQ,
if you hadn't noticed...

53:36.013 --> 53:39.085
and, I don't know,
I'm just sort of this underachiever.

53:39.253 --> 53:40.971
Underachiever?

53:41.133 --> 53:43.203
You're the toughest monkey
on this ship.

53:43.973 --> 53:44.962
- Monkey?
- Yeah.

53:45.133 --> 53:47.727
You call me monkey.
That's cute, that's really cute.

53:47.893 --> 53:48.882
You call me monkey.

53:49.053 --> 53:53.410
I hate that.
I hate to be called monkey.

53:53.573 --> 53:56.883
I mean, maybe it would've helped
if I wore my long black evening gown...

53:57.053 --> 54:00.045
but then, I packed it away
with all the rest of my summer things.

54:00.213 --> 54:03.808
- Oh, I wanna get out of here.
- Celeste. Celeste.

54:03.973 --> 54:05.725
- Celeste.
- What?

54:06.413 --> 54:08.324
I think you're beautiful.

54:08.933 --> 54:10.446
You do?

54:14.613 --> 54:16.490
You gonna kiss me now?

54:16.653 --> 54:18.086
No.

54:18.253 --> 54:21.051
Well, then let's just get
the hell out of here.

54:21.213 --> 54:22.851
Come on.

54:39.413 --> 54:42.564
Hey, kid, what are you doing?

54:43.333 --> 54:44.652
Look, what is the problem?

54:44.813 --> 54:46.531
Look, I'm grateful to you, okay?

54:46.693 --> 54:48.524
But we're not out of here yet.

54:48.693 --> 54:50.843
So in the meantime,
keep your distance.

54:51.013 --> 54:53.732
- What are you talking about?
- He knows what I mean.

54:53.893 --> 54:56.009
Theresa, what your father
is trying to tell you...

54:56.173 --> 54:58.243
is he's concerned I'll tear
your clothes off...

54:58.413 --> 55:00.529
and make love to you
here in front of him.

55:01.013 --> 55:02.048
- Hey!
- Stop it.

55:02.213 --> 55:03.692
Stop it, stop it.

55:03.853 --> 55:07.163
Don't you think we have enough
problems without that foolishness?

55:07.333 --> 55:10.166
Listen, I run a bar in Morristown,
New Jersey. I know what goes on.

55:10.333 --> 55:11.925
This guy's got one thing on his mind.

55:12.093 --> 55:14.732
I've seen old guys in there
with kids as young as my daughter.

55:14.893 --> 55:17.930
Well, thank goodness
I'm only 22 years old, right, Daddy?

55:18.093 --> 55:20.090
Listen, kid, if we get
out of here alive,

55:20.091 --> 55:22.086
I'm gonna kill you, you understand?

55:22.253 --> 55:25.006
What are we doing down here?
Sitting on our asses?

55:25.173 --> 55:26.811
You're reading a book, for chrissake.

55:26.973 --> 55:29.885
What else would you suggest
until Captain Turner comes back?

55:30.053 --> 55:31.566
How do you know he's coming back?

55:32.333 --> 55:34.528
How do you know they
didn't find another way out...

55:34.693 --> 55:36.331
and they're leaving us here to rot?

55:36.493 --> 55:37.926
Frank, so help me...

55:38.093 --> 55:41.972
you keep running off at the head, you
ain't getting one dang sip of this wine.

55:42.133 --> 55:44.283
Hey, Tex, take that wine
and shove it sideways.

55:44.453 --> 55:45.727
I'm talking about our lives.

55:45.893 --> 55:48.282
Mazzetti, if you don't stop griping...

55:48.453 --> 55:50.569
I'm coming over there
and shut you up for good.

55:50.733 --> 55:53.725
- Come on over here now!
- Stop.

55:53.893 --> 55:55.292
Hey, how's the party?

55:55.453 --> 55:58.126
- You two took long enough.
- Couldn't find a cab.

55:58.293 --> 56:00.329
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing.

56:00.493 --> 56:03.929
Listen, everybody,
this shaft's a dead end.

56:04.093 --> 56:06.288
Maybe Svevo found a way out.

56:06.453 --> 56:08.330
Let's go find him.

56:13.933 --> 56:15.810
Mike, it's Suzanne.

56:15.973 --> 56:17.292
Get Gina.

56:17.453 --> 56:19.444
Gina. Let her come first.

56:20.813 --> 56:23.088
Gina, Suzanne.

56:28.653 --> 56:30.132
She's dead.

56:30.413 --> 56:32.643
- Captain, this looks to me like...
- I know, I know.

56:32.813 --> 56:35.850
- I've seen bullet holes before.
- What are you saying here?

56:36.013 --> 56:37.708
There's a killer on
the ship somewhere?

56:37.709 --> 56:39.403
It's that guy Svevo.

56:39.573 --> 56:40.972
Maybe.

56:41.133 --> 56:43.010
We only found some of you an hour ago.

56:43.293 --> 56:45.443
We all assume she went after Svevo.

56:46.453 --> 56:48.364
She might not have reached him...

56:48.813 --> 56:50.565
but she certainly reached somebody.

56:51.093 --> 56:53.732
We can only assume she might have.

56:53.893 --> 56:55.326
Great.

56:56.813 --> 56:59.088
What do you suggest
that we do now, captain?

56:59.253 --> 57:00.971
We have no alternative.

57:01.133 --> 57:03.806
- We have to join Svevo.
- What, and get our head blown off?

57:04.333 --> 57:07.882
If Captain Turner's right and there is
a homicidal maniac on board this ship...

57:08.053 --> 57:11.284
and it's not Dr. Svevo,
then he's in as much danger as we are.

57:11.453 --> 57:13.603
There you go again, "if," "could."

57:13.773 --> 57:15.604
That's not good enough.

57:16.013 --> 57:20.131
Frank, old hoss,
just consider the alternatives.

57:21.653 --> 57:24.645
And we have enough now.
Let's get out. It's all here.

57:24.813 --> 57:26.724
All except for what
I came down here to find.

57:26.893 --> 57:28.690
Sprague Pumps. Keep looking.

57:29.773 --> 57:31.604
Load some of those,
in the unlikely event...

57:31.773 --> 57:34.765
that the others find their way
up here before we're finished.

57:36.053 --> 57:39.125
What's so damned important
about that one crate?

57:40.173 --> 57:43.131
Only one other person
knew the answer to that question...

57:43.293 --> 57:45.523
and that's why she had to die.

57:46.213 --> 57:49.410
Dr. Svevo. Sprague Pumps.

57:58.253 --> 58:00.164
Now maybe we got a way up and out.

58:01.973 --> 58:04.692
You ready? Let's go.

58:50.093 --> 58:53.403
- Where the hell are we?
- We're about amidship.

58:53.613 --> 58:56.002
Svevo can't be far off.

58:56.173 --> 58:58.846
He's above us and somewhere forward.

58:59.013 --> 59:01.846
- What is this place?
- I don't know.

59:02.013 --> 59:04.607
There are tanks above us, Mr. Meredith.
Large boiler tanks.

59:04.773 --> 59:07.412
Yeah, for desalinization.
Takes the salt out of the water.

59:07.613 --> 59:10.411
I've seen a lot of those tanks
on the docks in Marseilles.

59:10.573 --> 59:14.248
Speaking of Marseilles, how are we
gonna get out of here, captain?

59:14.413 --> 59:16.369
This bottle sure is getting heavy.

59:16.533 --> 59:21.049
Take a look. From now on we keep
moving upwards towards the surface.

59:21.213 --> 59:22.805
Up there.

59:43.333 --> 59:45.972
Get up there before it starts again.

59:46.893 --> 59:48.292
You first, Meredith.

59:48.453 --> 59:49.932
No, let the others go first.

59:50.093 --> 59:52.288
I haven't got time to argue.
Get up there.

59:52.453 --> 59:55.445
Above the pipe you're holding.
It's about 3 feet.

59:55.613 --> 59:57.285
Stand on this pipe.

59:57.453 --> 59:59.728
- Careful, your head.
- Watch your head. Come on.

59:59.893 --> 01:00:01.724
Give him your cane.

01:00:02.013 --> 01:00:03.571
You got his cane?

01:00:06.253 --> 01:00:08.005
Did he make it okay?

01:00:08.173 --> 01:00:10.084
Not bad. We're helping Gina up next.

01:00:10.253 --> 01:00:11.766
Give me that.

01:00:12.493 --> 01:00:13.821
- All right. Come on.
- Take it.

01:00:13.893 --> 01:00:15.292
This way. Come on.

01:00:15.453 --> 01:00:18.172
- Easy.
- Grab his arm.

01:00:18.733 --> 01:00:21.452
- Give me your hand.
- Hold the pipe above your head.

01:00:21.613 --> 01:00:24.332
Come on, get your bag.
Come on, honey, give me your hand.

01:00:24.493 --> 01:00:25.767
Come on.

01:00:27.213 --> 01:00:29.408
- Come on. Hold on.
- Captain.

01:00:31.133 --> 01:00:32.912
The hell with it. I'll
give you your share.

01:00:32.913 --> 01:00:34.091
Get up here.

01:00:34.253 --> 01:00:36.642
Hey, come on, honey. Come on.

01:00:38.533 --> 01:00:41.843
Frank, Larry, Wilbur, go to the
other side. Tex and I will handle this.

01:00:42.013 --> 01:00:44.846
- Get out of there, will you?
- I am, I am. Yeah, I am.

01:00:45.613 --> 01:00:47.285
Take that side.

01:00:49.453 --> 01:00:52.013
Steady. You ready?

01:00:52.813 --> 01:00:56.249
Right. Up, steady.

01:00:57.613 --> 01:01:01.492
- Quick, look.
- Wilbur, pass it back to Larry.

01:01:01.893 --> 01:01:03.406
Push back.

01:01:04.453 --> 01:01:06.250
Okay, get it across.

01:01:06.413 --> 01:01:07.812
Hold it.

01:01:12.013 --> 01:01:14.402
Okay, hold it.
Let me get underneath.

01:01:14.573 --> 01:01:16.245
- Push it. There.
- Come on, lift it.

01:01:17.613 --> 01:01:19.126
Skipper.

01:01:19.573 --> 01:01:21.564
Those doors could be locked tight.

01:01:21.733 --> 01:01:23.689
I won't know that
till I get there, will I?

01:01:23.853 --> 01:01:25.445
Please hurry.

01:01:29.293 --> 01:01:31.124
Put your foot in the bucket.

01:01:52.813 --> 01:01:54.246
It doesn't look too difficult.

01:01:54.413 --> 01:01:56.051
Just keep your eyes on the road.

01:02:13.333 --> 01:02:16.609
Wilbur, the door's open.

01:02:20.973 --> 01:02:22.850
Look out below.

01:02:32.813 --> 01:02:34.246
Great.

01:02:57.533 --> 01:03:00.570
It's easier now.
I've made a bridge for you.

01:03:00.893 --> 01:03:03.646
Okay, who's first?

01:03:05.613 --> 01:03:08.685
- I am. I've got the goods.
- Let's go.

01:03:12.013 --> 01:03:14.049
Crawl right astraddle
of it, little lady.

01:03:14.213 --> 01:03:15.202
You ever ride a horse?

01:03:15.373 --> 01:03:18.524
Are you serious? She was a professional
jockey for five years.

01:03:18.693 --> 01:03:20.729
Three, actually.

01:03:31.293 --> 01:03:32.646
Frank?

01:03:33.813 --> 01:03:35.087
Thanks.

01:03:35.973 --> 01:03:39.409
- Keep your eyes on the road.
- Right.

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.795
You know, you're really
a terrific-looking guy.

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:01.949
That's all right.

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.031
- I was gonna pull you up anyway.
- Yeah.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.760
- Cross the grill and wait in the room.
- Right.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:10.676
- Gina, you're next.
- Okay, here.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.073
Take it easy, Gina.
Take it easy.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:28.038
- You all right?
- I'm afraid I...

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.270
I kept my eyes closed
most of the way.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:31.839
Tell that to Meredith.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.198
Cross the grill carefully
and wait in the room with Celeste.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.471
Okay. You next, Hannah.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.708
- You'll watch him?
- How else would I know how to do it.

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.112
Give me your hand.

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.078
I've gotcha, I've gotcha.

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.435
- Put your foot in there carefully.
- Okay.

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:01.156
It's all right, Hal.
I'm up here. I'm safe.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.791
Right hand up here. Now, the rungs
are a little higher than a ladder's.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.237
Seems simple enough.

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.638
You might say I even have
an advantage.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.233
How's that?

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.393
Can't see anything below.

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.671
Give me the stick.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:40.636
- Hannah! Hannah!
- Hang on.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.913
Hannah!

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.560
Hold on. Hold on.
Put your left hand up.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.639
Give it here.

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:52.834
Put your feet on the rung.

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.709
- Hannah!
- Hold on.

01:05:58.040 --> 01:05:59.996
- Hannah.
- Pull.

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.950
Can you shift his feet?
That's it, slowly.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.833
Now you're right at the top.
Feel the top.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.958
One more, one more.
Now stand still. Let me move.

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:20.315
- Hannah?
- She's all right.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.632
- Hannah!
- She's hurt her shoulder.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.677
That's all.
She just hurt her shoulder.

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:26.592
- Thank goodness.
- Stand still, Meredith.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.556
Let me get her. Don't move.

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.435
There's a step there, step over.

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.468
Watch her arm. Watch her.

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:39.712
Here, lean over my shoulder if you can.
Easy, easy.

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:42.758
Celeste, get her legs if you can.

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:49.155
Now, there's a pipe
right in front of you.

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:53.356
- What can I do to help?
- Open the case, Celeste.

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.238
Take it easy.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.797
Lean against there.

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:01.873
Here.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:08.358
Her shoulder's dislocated.
She won't get very far this way.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.873
What can you do?

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.679
Pop it back into place if I can.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:16.150
It's gonna hurt a great deal,
Mrs. Meredith. I'm so sorry.

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.871
Now, step down towards me.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.110
- Everybody, come on up.
- Step down.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:24.396
Right foot. Don't drop this.

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:26.278
Hannah.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:29.671
- Okay, you're up now.
- Hurry, hurry. Come on.

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:40.200
Turn you around and sit you down.

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:44.470
Here. Sit down.

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.235
You're a hell of a fellow, Meredith.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:58.474
I don't have that much choice, captain.

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:05.151
- What's the matter?
- Just a leg cramp. I'll be all right.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:08.073
I'm not used to all this
physical exertion.

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.629
I've got a few aches and pains myself.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.358
My wife, she'll need
a great deal of extra attention now.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.631
You know, she tries
to appear brave but...

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.995
- Yeah, she's terrified.
- Yeah.

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.513
Just like me.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.796
Well, not like you...

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.636
but terrified, yes.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.598
And you're not?

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:34.870
Captain, I've felt this much
fear and apprehension...

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:37.515
this much doubt
and lack of confidence...

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.558
in simply trying to cross
an unfamiliar room.

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:54.557
Here's your stick.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.517
Thank you.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.830
Thank you, captain, for everything.

01:09:06.519 --> 01:09:09.795
Theresa, your father...

01:09:10.759 --> 01:09:13.432
has he always had
such a one-track mind?

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:20.189
Well, you know,
his bark is worse than his bite.

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:22.554
He means well.

01:09:23.919 --> 01:09:25.432
Yeah, well...

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:29.595
I guess if I had a daughter
as pretty as you are...

01:09:29.759 --> 01:09:32.193
I'd probably act the same way.

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:36.076
Thank you.

01:09:41.158 --> 01:09:43.115
- Wilbur, sarge.
- A body.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:46.430
- Keep the rest here.
- It's a dead body.

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:55.590
The ax must have been waiting for him
as he came around this corner.

01:09:55.759 --> 01:09:57.636
- The girl?
- She's gotta be the favorite.

01:09:57.799 --> 01:09:59.710
And look where she wound up.

01:10:00.319 --> 01:10:03.231
Now we've got Svevo
between us and the surface.

01:10:04.079 --> 01:10:05.592
Stay here.

01:10:06.319 --> 01:10:08.355
All right, we're gonna spread out.

01:10:08.519 --> 01:10:11.113
Go down the passageway.
Half on one side, half on the other.

01:10:11.279 --> 01:10:13.918
If anything happens, hit the deck
and then run like hell.

01:10:14.079 --> 01:10:15.068
Come on. Come on.

01:10:15.239 --> 01:10:17.355
- Sarge?
- Okay, come on.

01:10:17.799 --> 01:10:19.596
Come on, come on.

01:10:19.759 --> 01:10:21.954
Watch your foot. Come on.

01:10:40.559 --> 01:10:42.390
Do you wanna go first?

01:10:43.399 --> 01:10:45.230
Well, you go first, then.

01:10:57.639 --> 01:10:59.277
They've been here, that's for sure.

01:10:59.439 --> 01:11:01.794
What the hell would they be looking for?

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:06.319
- You guys need a fourth for bridge?
- Turner, look over here.

01:11:11.719 --> 01:11:13.949
There's enough here to start a war.

01:11:14.439 --> 01:11:16.999
Well, that's a slight exaggeration.

01:11:17.159 --> 01:11:18.911
I'm sorry about this, captain.

01:11:19.879 --> 01:11:21.995
I had hoped that we would
never meet again.

01:11:23.399 --> 01:11:25.754
Who's that? What does he want?

01:11:25.919 --> 01:11:27.614
He's your basic
garden-variety terrorist,

01:11:27.615 --> 01:11:29.309
and I think he wants to kill us.

01:11:29.479 --> 01:11:33.028
Well, however accurate the second part
of your statement may be, please...

01:11:33.199 --> 01:11:37.829
don't confuse me with some
politically impotent bomb thrower.

01:11:38.119 --> 01:11:39.837
The truth is, I came
aboard this ship with

01:11:39.838 --> 01:11:41.555
a purer motive than Captain Turner...

01:11:41.719 --> 01:11:45.507
to recover a piece of property
which was already mine.

01:11:45.679 --> 01:11:49.228
You can take whatever you want
from this ship. You're welcome to it.

01:11:49.399 --> 01:11:51.390
But these people have come
a long way...

01:11:51.559 --> 01:11:54.995
and all they want right now
is to get the hell out of here alive.

01:11:55.159 --> 01:11:58.071
Now, as one man of substance
to another...

01:11:59.519 --> 01:12:01.191
Now, hold on.
Just hear me out, son.

01:12:02.559 --> 01:12:05.835
Tell you what, I'll write a check
for the whole shebang here...

01:12:05.999 --> 01:12:08.229
and you can just lay down
your little rifles...

01:12:08.399 --> 01:12:12.312
and we'll all haul ass
out of here together. What do you say?

01:12:12.479 --> 01:12:15.118
Take a look at that open crate
behind me, captain.

01:12:15.279 --> 01:12:19.238
I sincerely doubt that your friend
over there could reimburse me for that.

01:12:19.399 --> 01:12:21.469
Okay, open it. Let's see.

01:12:22.359 --> 01:12:25.317
You open that barrel, captain,
and we all die.

01:12:25.479 --> 01:12:30.314
And I have every reasonable hope
of wanting to watch the sun set tonight.

01:12:30.479 --> 01:12:32.138
What's this crap you're
dishing out here?

01:12:32.139 --> 01:12:33.596
What are you trying to tell us?

01:12:33.759 --> 01:12:36.193
You got some doomsday machine
in there or something?

01:12:36.359 --> 01:12:38.873
With the information
commonly available today...

01:12:39.039 --> 01:12:43.237
any enterprising science student
could build a nuclear device.

01:12:43.919 --> 01:12:46.558
- Uranium?
- Plutonium.

01:12:46.719 --> 01:12:50.109
And as the American government
is painfully aware...

01:12:50.279 --> 01:12:53.191
this isn't the first shipment
to go astray.

01:12:53.799 --> 01:12:56.472
Son, now listen to me.

01:12:56.639 --> 01:13:00.837
If I was to tell you that I got
certain connections at the Pentagon...?

01:13:00.999 --> 01:13:05.151
Then I would have to tell you
that my connections are more powerful.

01:13:06.759 --> 01:13:09.478
I had never intended
to harm anyone, captain.

01:13:10.159 --> 01:13:13.151
But as you must realize,
I can't let you go now.

01:13:31.239 --> 01:13:33.195
- Get out of here and I'll cover you.
- No way.

01:13:33.359 --> 01:13:34.758
No way. We go together.

01:13:34.919 --> 01:13:37.194
Get out of here.
They need you more than I do.

01:13:37.959 --> 01:13:39.631
Come on. Come on.

01:13:40.199 --> 01:13:42.667
Okay. Cover me.

01:13:42.839 --> 01:13:43.828
Go.

01:13:48.759 --> 01:13:51.398
Hey, kid, get the hell out of here.
What are you doing?

01:13:51.559 --> 01:13:52.787
I'm staying.

01:13:53.959 --> 01:13:55.517
- All right, kid.
- All right, Daddy.

01:13:55.679 --> 01:13:57.635
- Be ready to move, right?
- Right.

01:13:57.799 --> 01:13:59.027
- Go.
- Go.

01:14:03.399 --> 01:14:04.673
Go!

01:14:11.559 --> 01:14:13.231
After them.

01:14:30.839 --> 01:14:32.511
Wilbur.

01:14:35.079 --> 01:14:36.990
Get in there. Come on.

01:14:37.479 --> 01:14:38.878
Steady.

01:14:51.919 --> 01:14:55.878
The crates. The crates.
Here, here.

01:15:00.759 --> 01:15:02.750
Take cover behind the crates.

01:15:46.359 --> 01:15:47.917
Save your ammo.

01:15:48.079 --> 01:15:49.478
We've gotta shut that door.

01:15:49.639 --> 01:15:51.914
If they can't get at us,
they won't hang around long.

01:15:52.079 --> 01:15:54.912
Svevo's gotta deliver that plutonium
as soon as possible.

01:15:55.079 --> 01:15:59.834
Now, when I say go,
we rush the door together.

01:15:59.999 --> 01:16:02.513
Hey, kid, kid.
Get down there.

01:16:02.679 --> 01:16:05.512
Put short bursts into that door
until we've tried to close it, okay?

01:16:05.679 --> 01:16:07.112
Get down.

01:16:09.959 --> 01:16:12.632
- Ready, Larry?
- Ready.

01:16:13.479 --> 01:16:14.912
- Ready, sarge?
- Yeah.

01:16:15.079 --> 01:16:16.478
Go.

01:16:29.639 --> 01:16:32.631
Hey, I knew I wasn't
gonna make it out of here.

01:16:32.799 --> 01:16:37.475
Turner, take care of my little girl.
I'm all she's got.

01:16:37.959 --> 01:16:39.028
You still got a chance.

01:16:39.199 --> 01:16:41.110
You gotta get her out of here,
you understand?

01:16:41.959 --> 01:16:43.278
She's gonna make it.

01:16:45.359 --> 01:16:46.951
If I do, she will.

01:16:47.119 --> 01:16:48.347
Swear to God?

01:16:49.319 --> 01:16:50.547
I swear, sarge.

01:16:53.639 --> 01:16:56.517
A grenade.
Aim at that leaky porthole.

01:16:56.679 --> 01:16:58.715
We'll blast them open,
then lock them in.

01:16:58.879 --> 01:17:00.870
They'll drown quickly.

01:17:02.719 --> 01:17:03.913
Now.

01:17:07.359 --> 01:17:08.348
Hit the deck!

01:17:17.519 --> 01:17:19.714
- What's the matter?
- I got hit.

01:17:28.679 --> 01:17:30.874
- Daddy.
- Hey, baby.

01:17:31.439 --> 01:17:33.316
It's all right.

01:17:34.079 --> 01:17:38.277
What are you gonna do
without me to yell at you anymore?

01:17:41.039 --> 01:17:42.736
I never... I never
wanted to yell at you.

01:17:42.737 --> 01:17:44.033
I know.

01:17:44.199 --> 01:17:46.952
- I tried to be a good father.
- I know.

01:17:47.119 --> 01:17:49.758
You, you live your life.

01:17:52.199 --> 01:17:55.271
I love you, Daddy.
I love you.

01:17:56.399 --> 01:17:58.390
God bless you.

01:18:03.359 --> 01:18:04.758
No.

01:18:07.679 --> 01:18:09.749
Daddy!

01:18:21.519 --> 01:18:23.874
- What happened?
- It's okay.

01:18:24.039 --> 01:18:27.395
- It's just a fragment. You're lucky.
- It's my lucky day.

01:18:36.159 --> 01:18:37.487
- Let's go.
- How do we get out?

01:18:37.559 --> 01:18:39.595
The same way we came in.

01:18:40.199 --> 01:18:41.791
What about him? He's still alive.

01:18:41.959 --> 01:18:45.315
Well, that's unfortunate,
because we're leaving without him.

01:18:51.039 --> 01:18:53.473
That porthole's gonna go
at any moment.

01:18:53.639 --> 01:18:57.154
We gotta find another way
out of here, and right now.

01:19:12.599 --> 01:19:14.237
What is that metallic sound?

01:19:14.399 --> 01:19:18.028
It's a... Like a car
banging against the wall.

01:19:18.919 --> 01:19:20.716
That's a door, that's not a wall.

01:19:20.879 --> 01:19:24.155
It's not a solid sound.
That's... That's a door!

01:19:40.039 --> 01:19:41.870
He's right. There is a door.

01:19:42.039 --> 01:19:43.392
Move these.

01:20:03.719 --> 01:20:06.392
There's a ladder to the right.
Swim for it.

01:20:06.559 --> 01:20:09.119
- Hannah.
- Mrs. Meredith, get Mrs. Meredith.

01:20:13.919 --> 01:20:15.113
Come on, ma'am.

01:20:15.279 --> 01:20:18.430
Oh, I'm sorry.
Didn't mean to hurt you.

01:20:28.959 --> 01:20:31.075
Careful. Careful.

01:20:51.279 --> 01:20:53.998
Harold! Harold!

01:21:07.879 --> 01:21:11.838
Larry, give me the gold.

01:21:25.919 --> 01:21:28.114
Hang on, hang on.

01:21:30.639 --> 01:21:32.914
Sorry, sorry.

01:21:38.039 --> 01:21:39.518
- Oh, God.
- Hang in there.

01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:48.354
All right, help.

01:21:48.999 --> 01:21:50.751
- Hal, are you all right?
- Yes.

01:21:50.919 --> 01:21:54.275
Go ahead. Go ahead.

01:22:05.599 --> 01:22:08.113
Take it easy. Nice and slow.

01:22:08.279 --> 01:22:10.918
You ready? Okay.

01:22:23.239 --> 01:22:25.150
I'm here.

01:24:29.279 --> 01:24:30.951
Meredith.

01:24:39.479 --> 01:24:41.276
I'm sorry.

01:24:42.399 --> 01:24:43.832
God.

01:24:44.319 --> 01:24:46.514
- Oh, God.
- Take care of him.

01:24:52.039 --> 01:24:53.791
Mr. Meredith.

01:24:56.839 --> 01:24:59.399
Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

01:24:59.559 --> 01:25:01.789
Hey, come on.

01:26:09.639 --> 01:26:11.197
Okay, everybody can come in here.

01:26:11.679 --> 01:26:13.032
Come on.

01:26:16.199 --> 01:26:19.077
Keep an eye on them.
I'm gonna have a look around.

01:26:21.919 --> 01:26:23.477
All right, in here.

01:26:29.919 --> 01:26:33.070
Come on.
We're staying in here.

01:27:10.919 --> 01:27:13.956
You'd be better off
paying attention to me.

01:28:17.119 --> 01:28:19.269
It's gonna leave a little scar.

01:28:19.999 --> 01:28:24.356
Well, at least I've still
got my dazzling personality.

01:28:24.839 --> 01:28:26.875
Gina, you know what?

01:28:27.039 --> 01:28:28.995
This may sound silly...

01:28:29.159 --> 01:28:31.912
but if I had my way, only one
other person would ever see it.

01:28:32.639 --> 01:28:35.278
- What do you think?
- Well, I...

01:28:35.439 --> 01:28:38.829
I know, he treats me like a creep,
but at least he knows I'm alive.

01:28:40.599 --> 01:28:44.194
- If we get out of this.
- Yeah.

01:28:53.279 --> 01:28:54.553
Tex?

01:28:54.719 --> 01:28:56.152
Tex.

01:28:59.839 --> 01:29:03.718
- Would you do me a favor?
- Shoot, it's done, little lady.

01:29:05.319 --> 01:29:09.471
If I don't get out of here,
and you and Mike do... I mean, just if.

01:29:09.639 --> 01:29:11.869
Mike has a very big mortgage
on his tug...

01:29:12.039 --> 01:29:14.599
and the J <i>enny</i> may be the only
thing in the world he wants.

01:29:14.759 --> 01:29:18.035
Heck, you're loaded.
Would you take care of it for him?

01:29:18.199 --> 01:29:22.590
That's not doing nobody a favor.
That's just being decent, hon.

01:29:23.119 --> 01:29:25.030
Tex, you're okay.

01:29:33.919 --> 01:29:34.988
Can I help you?

01:29:41.319 --> 01:29:42.388
Thanks anyway.

01:29:44.519 --> 01:29:49.912
You know, you're a kind-hearted lady.
I've been watching you.

01:29:52.119 --> 01:29:54.075
You helped Meredith.

01:29:55.159 --> 01:29:57.150
And you helped everybody
that needed help.

01:29:57.439 --> 01:30:00.670
- I am a nurse, you know.
- Oh, yeah, I know.

01:30:03.399 --> 01:30:05.390
I'll tell you what else I know.

01:30:05.999 --> 01:30:11.392
There are a few I would've liked to have
beaned over the head with a bedpan.

01:30:11.719 --> 01:30:13.198
I know what you mean.

01:30:13.799 --> 01:30:16.472
I was the head nurse for 12 years
in a Philadelphia hospital.

01:30:16.639 --> 01:30:19.995
- And some of those girls, I...
- Why did you leave?

01:30:21.159 --> 01:30:26.187
Well, when they gave me
my 20-year gold service pin...

01:30:26.359 --> 01:30:28.315
You're not that old.

01:30:29.839 --> 01:30:34.754
It suddenly dawned on me that
Philadelphia wasn't quite as romantic...

01:30:34.919 --> 01:30:37.479
as a Greek isle in the moonlight.

01:30:38.439 --> 01:30:42.318
So I resigned
and signed on the <i>Poseidon</i>...

01:30:42.479 --> 01:30:44.549
hoping to add a little spice
to my life.

01:30:44.719 --> 01:30:47.279
You spiced it up all right.

01:30:54.679 --> 01:30:56.795
Happy New Year, everybody.

01:30:57.319 --> 01:30:59.594
I think I've found a way out.

01:30:59.759 --> 01:31:00.794
- Celeste?
- Yeah?

01:31:00.959 --> 01:31:05.157
Wilbur, I've got a job for you.
The rest of you, stay here for a moment.

01:31:15.399 --> 01:31:17.037
If we get out...

01:31:18.559 --> 01:31:21.357
When. When we get out of here...

01:31:21.839 --> 01:31:25.149
and you go home, where will that be?

01:31:27.399 --> 01:31:28.514
I don't know.

01:31:29.719 --> 01:31:32.358
Back to New Jersey, I guess.

01:31:34.319 --> 01:31:36.196
Well, I've been thinking.

01:31:36.359 --> 01:31:38.919
Maybe you'd like to go back
to lowa with me for a while.

01:31:41.839 --> 01:31:45.309
Hey, it's a whole lot farther away
from the ocean than New Jersey.

01:31:47.879 --> 01:31:49.517
This is our only way out.

01:31:49.679 --> 01:31:52.876
There is a cargo hatch not too far down.

01:31:53.039 --> 01:31:56.156
We swim out
and then up to the surface.

01:31:56.319 --> 01:31:59.436
Swim underwater? Well, shoot.

01:31:59.599 --> 01:32:04.229
Unless you can round up a sea horse for
me to ride, you can just count me out.

01:32:04.599 --> 01:32:06.635
Wilbur, Celeste, speed it up, will you?

01:32:12.839 --> 01:32:15.034
- Wilbur?
- Forget it.

01:32:15.399 --> 01:32:18.232
Wilbur, you gotta just hang on now.
We're so close to getting out.

01:32:18.399 --> 01:32:20.230
We're all gonna get out
if you just hang on.

01:32:20.399 --> 01:32:22.276
You just try and keep up with me.

01:32:22.839 --> 01:32:24.511
What the hell's keeping them?

01:32:24.679 --> 01:32:27.068
Celeste? What the hell
is going on in there?

01:32:27.239 --> 01:32:29.673
I'm getting my hair done, dummy.
What do you think?

01:32:29.839 --> 01:32:31.875
Go ahead. Pick up the gear
and take it in there.

01:32:32.039 --> 01:32:34.792
- I'll come along in a moment.
- What's taking so long?

01:32:34.959 --> 01:32:37.268
Get going. Go ahead. Go ahead.

01:32:38.399 --> 01:32:39.878
Come on, go.

01:32:53.159 --> 01:32:55.719
It's getting worse,
isn't it, old man?

01:32:55.879 --> 01:32:58.677
It would get much better
if you'd stop calling me old man.

01:32:59.559 --> 01:33:03.711
Well, you just stay close to me
all the way home.

01:33:04.119 --> 01:33:05.518
Is that understood?

01:33:08.919 --> 01:33:12.195
You grew up to be one hell
of a nice man, you know that?

01:33:13.159 --> 01:33:15.798
And you were such a rotten kid.

01:33:18.599 --> 01:33:19.873
Now.

01:33:25.319 --> 01:33:28.117
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:33:33.039 --> 01:33:35.428
None of us are experienced divers,
captain.

01:33:35.599 --> 01:33:37.396
It's our only way out.

01:33:37.559 --> 01:33:39.868
I'm gonna turn you all into frogmen.

01:33:40.039 --> 01:33:42.189
No one has a choice.

01:33:42.959 --> 01:33:46.395
There should be two more, Wilbur. I
counted four between the eight of them.

01:33:46.559 --> 01:33:49.756
One is empty.
The one I'm getting is half full.

01:33:50.639 --> 01:33:53.517
- Who's gonna get the scubas?
- Everyone.

01:33:53.919 --> 01:33:56.228
Last time I went to school
three didn't go into eight.

01:33:56.399 --> 01:33:58.867
- What did you say?
- Three doesn't go into eight.

01:33:59.039 --> 01:34:00.711
With him, it's possible.

01:34:00.999 --> 01:34:03.559
You mean Jacques Cousteau
never taught you buddy breathing?

01:34:03.719 --> 01:34:07.268
- What's buddy breathing?
- More than one diver on a single tank.

01:34:07.439 --> 01:34:09.794
Wilbur and I've done it before,
so we'll use the least air.

01:34:09.959 --> 01:34:12.757
It will be about more than enough
in there for the both of us.

01:34:12.919 --> 01:34:15.672
- Yeah, then I'll take what's left over.
- Okay.

01:34:15.839 --> 01:34:19.229
Gina, you and Meredith
are the team on the second tank.

01:34:19.719 --> 01:34:22.313
Which leaves Theresa, me and Tex.

01:34:22.479 --> 01:34:25.437
Well, you can forget about me.
I'm staying here.

01:34:25.599 --> 01:34:28.193
If you get out, why,
you can come back and get me.

01:34:28.359 --> 01:34:29.587
Not today, Tex.

01:34:29.759 --> 01:34:33.468
Listen to me, all of you!
I'm a phony!

01:34:33.639 --> 01:34:35.072
A $3 bill!

01:34:35.559 --> 01:34:39.393
I haven't got no money.
No oil wells.

01:34:39.559 --> 01:34:42.517
And right now, not a hell
of a lot of self-respect.

01:34:44.439 --> 01:34:47.317
You've all been
straight aces with me...

01:34:47.479 --> 01:34:50.516
and I just didn't want
you to find out about it later on.

01:34:50.679 --> 01:34:53.955
You worked in the galley on this ship,
didn't you, Tex?

01:34:54.119 --> 01:34:56.155
That's pretty close.

01:34:56.839 --> 01:34:58.875
I'm the assistant wine steward.

01:34:59.039 --> 01:35:02.349
That's how come this bottle
meant so much to me.

01:35:02.759 --> 01:35:05.432
Means more to me
than a whole year's salary.

01:35:06.919 --> 01:35:08.238
How'd you know, captain?

01:35:08.399 --> 01:35:11.869
Even a bloodhound couldn't smell a cold
pie in a refrigerator at 100 feet.

01:35:12.919 --> 01:35:14.716
You had to know where
that kitchen was.

01:35:14.879 --> 01:35:18.394
Then why the ruse, Mr. Hopkins?
What was the point of it all?

01:35:18.559 --> 01:35:20.515
To survive.

01:35:20.679 --> 01:35:26.197
The way I had it figured out, why, the
rich always get saved first anywhere.

01:35:27.039 --> 01:35:31.191
I just never thought that we'd all
wind up like this, down here together.

01:35:31.359 --> 01:35:36.877
Well, that's the way
we're going out, Tex, together.

01:35:37.519 --> 01:35:41.558
Okay, girls, let's get this gear on your
back, and I'll show you how to use it.

01:35:49.519 --> 01:35:51.237
Don't you think we can go now, doctor?

01:35:51.639 --> 01:35:53.954
If I thought so, I
would've suggested it.

01:35:53.955 --> 01:35:56.269
Our mission is still incomplete.

01:35:56.439 --> 01:36:00.512
The one marked Sprague Pumps,
bring it up now.

01:36:04.839 --> 01:36:09.788
The one last thing to remember
is don't panic and you'll be okay.

01:36:10.319 --> 01:36:11.991
Okay, Celeste.

01:36:14.439 --> 01:36:16.794
Remember the order you go in.

01:39:01.199 --> 01:39:02.951
Where's Wilbur?

01:39:03.119 --> 01:39:05.428
He's still down there.
I'll get him.

01:40:18.359 --> 01:40:19.917
I couldn't find him.

01:40:20.079 --> 01:40:23.071
- I'm gonna get the tug. Stay here.
- I'm going with you.

01:41:36.919 --> 01:41:38.591
Stay there.

01:42:15.519 --> 01:42:18.875
Release that anchor on the back.

01:42:29.799 --> 01:42:32.359
J <i>enny</i>, please don't let me down now.

01:42:35.719 --> 01:42:37.914
Here's a rifle. Use it.

01:42:40.999 --> 01:42:45.151
They're alive. There they are.
Don't let them get away.

01:42:48.959 --> 01:42:50.756
Well, shoot, you idiot!
Shoot! Shoot!

01:42:50.919 --> 01:42:53.149
It's jammed. I'm trying.

01:42:54.159 --> 01:42:56.389
Shoot, for Pete's sake. Shoot.

01:42:56.599 --> 01:42:58.715
Aim at the boxes.
Maybe you'll hit one of them.

01:43:18.879 --> 01:43:22.269
- Tex, let me help you.
- I'm okay.

01:43:35.519 --> 01:43:38.272
- Oh, my gosh, I shot one of them.
- Well, shoot another one.

01:43:38.439 --> 01:43:40.669
Drop back and get the gun.

01:43:50.159 --> 01:43:51.558
Come on, Tex. Swim for it.

01:43:54.839 --> 01:43:56.397
Faster!

01:43:57.279 --> 01:43:59.076
The man in the water.

01:44:03.079 --> 01:44:04.990
For you, little lady.

01:44:06.439 --> 01:44:08.828
Tex! Tex!

01:44:15.679 --> 01:44:17.670
- Let's haul them in.
- Okay.

01:45:54.759 --> 01:45:58.354
Poor Wilbur. Why did he do it?

01:45:58.999 --> 01:46:01.274
We only had two air tanks left.

01:46:02.279 --> 01:46:04.315
He knew we never had a chance...

01:46:05.519 --> 01:46:07.669
so he gave whatever life he had left.

01:46:09.479 --> 01:46:11.754
I really loved that old man.

01:46:14.519 --> 01:46:16.350
What are you gonna do now?

01:46:16.559 --> 01:46:18.595
Go back to your chateau?

01:46:19.719 --> 01:46:22.108
There is no chateau.

01:46:23.079 --> 01:46:24.307
Someplace must be home.

01:46:25.359 --> 01:46:27.714
I'm open to suggestions.

01:46:29.159 --> 01:46:32.674
Well, I'd sign you on the J <i>enny</i>...

01:46:33.159 --> 01:46:36.515
but the bank's gonna take the
boat away the minute we reach port.

01:46:37.919 --> 01:46:40.035
Maybe not.

01:46:47.759 --> 01:46:49.715
Gonna kiss me now?

01:46:50.999 --> 01:46:53.149
I was gonna kiss you anyway.
