00:02.794 --> 00:04.375
NARRATOR: Three weeks ago,
an invisible dome

00:04.546 --> 00:06.377
crashed down on Chester's Mill,

00:06.548 --> 00:08.413
cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

00:09.176 --> 00:11.007
The dome has tested our limits,

00:11.178 --> 00:14.090
forcing each of us to confront
our own personal demons:

00:14.848 --> 00:15.883
rage,

00:17.059 --> 00:18.674
grief,

00:19.686 --> 00:21.642
- fear.
- My God.

00:23.315 --> 00:25.431
Now, in order to survive,
we must battle

00:25.609 --> 00:27.520
our most dangerous adversary:

00:27.986 --> 00:30.102
the enemy within.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.650
Why do we need these amethysts?

00:32.824 --> 00:34.155
They power the dome.

00:34.326 --> 00:36.066
If we bring the amethysts
above ground,

00:36.245 --> 00:37.655
I'm hoping we can recharge.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.696
JULIA: Christine has some sort
of a schematic in her office.

00:40.874 --> 00:41.954
I don't know what it's for,

00:42.125 --> 00:43.990
but those amethysts
are definitely part of it.

00:44.169 --> 00:46.410
Think you can plant the explosives
and get out in time?

00:46.588 --> 00:47.748
Yeah, not a problem.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.002
Norrie, stop!

00:54.263 --> 00:57.255
My mom sacrificed herself
so that her child could live.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.297
You set off those bombs, didn't you?

00:59.476 --> 01:02.843
The actions of this Resistance
have threatened our very survival.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.557
We need to kill them all.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.316
JULIA:
Really open to suggestions here.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.655
JOE: These seven geometric shapes
on the schematic

01:19.830 --> 01:21.240
could be the tunnel amethysts.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.747
This is serious.
We hit the Kinship hard.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.078
They're gonna come at us
with everything they've got.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.752
[GUN COCKS]

01:33.885 --> 01:35.876
Shh.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.384
Carolyn said
the amethysts were important

01:44.563 --> 01:45.894
to the Kinship's survival.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.929
That's why Christine
wanted them dug up.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.440
I'm not feeling great. Do you mind?

01:50.611 --> 01:52.067
Of course. We got this.

01:54.031 --> 01:57.023
She's taking Carolyn's death
pretty hard.

01:57.492 --> 01:58.652
We all are.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.910
All right, one, two, three.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.750
All right, muzzles down.

02:12.924 --> 02:13.959
- Anything?
- All clear.

02:14.343 --> 02:15.708
All clear.

02:15.886 --> 02:17.751
- Upstairs?
- Yeah, upstairs clear.

02:20.766 --> 02:22.882
Where the hell are they?

02:25.103 --> 02:27.845
Norrie's not the only one creeped out
we're in a funeral home.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.807
This could mean anything.

02:31.985 --> 02:35.978
The only person who can tell us
what this design means is Christine.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.282
Torch the place.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.663
Hunter, focus on cracking
the password

02:43.830 --> 02:47.163
on Christine's recorder.
Maybe we'll find an answer there.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.915
John to Yoko.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.631
George and Ringo just torched
the Aktaion house.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.880
Looks like Christine's out for blood.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.590
We can figure out our next move
when you get back.

03:01.765 --> 03:03.847
Yeah, copy that.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.228
- What, they weren't there?
- They knew we were coming.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.224
My bet is they're no longer
on the island.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.233
- They could be anywhere.
- We’ll ﬁnd them.

03:15.404 --> 03:18.146
Julia and Jim will pay
for what they did.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.288
- Christine, what is it? What's wrong?
- Nothing.

- Eva.

Hey.

04:16.882 --> 04:19.794
I'm sorry about this place.

for us here.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.473
a lot.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.679
Norrie, ifl had known
that you and Joe, or Carolyn,

04:33.857 --> 04:37.099
- were down in those tunnels, I never--
- It's not your fault.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.738
It's Christine's.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.523
And she's to blame for all of this.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.703
I promise you,

04:50.624 --> 04:52.831
your mother's death won't be in vain.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.171
She was in so much pain.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.134
But at least she didn't die
as one of those things.

05:15.065 --> 05:19.980
Because, even if it was just
for a few minutes...

05:21.738 --> 05:24.275
I had my mom back.

05:24.825 --> 05:28.363
If you need anything,
I'm here, okay?

05:29.538 --> 05:31.119
Okay.

to get Barbie back,

05:45.011 --> 05:46.672
the real Barbie,

05:49.724 --> 05:51.976
you have to take it.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.277
How is this possible?
We only slept together yesterday.

06:08.451 --> 06:12.740
You're carrying the new queen.
This isn't any ordinary pregnancy.

What's with the guards?
Everything okay?

06:18.837 --> 06:21.044
I'll leave you two alone.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.766
What's happening?

06:35.395 --> 06:39.604
Remember right before we woke up
from the cocoon world?

06:39.774 --> 06:41.605
- Right.
- We were in the hospital.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.108
Yeah.

- You're pregnant?
- It's a girl.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.538
- Okay, okay.
- Christine's certain, but I don't--

07:01.713 --> 07:03.294
Sit down.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.713
But what's with the guards?

07:05.884 --> 07:08.125
It's a precaution.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.793
Big Jim and Julia could be anywhere,

07:10.180 --> 07:12.045
- and she might--
- Listen to me.

or this baby.

in Christine's bonnet.

we're gonna have to move again.

Yeah, I did.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.866
I'm also a student of history.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.452
When you're at war,
always have an exit strategy.

- Guys, you gotta hear this.
- You cracked the password?

07:43.171 --> 07:47.005
So I rewound to the beginning.
This is Christine's first entry.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.756
CHRISTINE:
It's a shame we '/I never meet,

07:48.927 --> 07:50.667
but these recordings
are meant to guide you,

07:50.845 --> 07:53.382
to help you and your parents,

07:53.556 --> 07:55.808
usher in a new generation,

07:55.976 --> 07:59.093

with you as its queen.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.932
- Barbie and Eva, they're supposed to--
- Have a baby?

08:02.107 --> 08:05.224
That's been Christine's plan
from the start?

08:07.404 --> 08:10.487
It was my idea
to bring the amethyst here.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.568
It'll be guarded at all times.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.528
Good work, James.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.910

to let anything happen to it.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.116
ljust wish
I could've stopped Big Jim.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.667
I'll keep searching,
I'll find the Resistance and kill them.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.826
- Spare Joe.
- But he's just as guilty

08:24.004 --> 08:25.995
- as the rest.
- With only one amethyst remaining,

08:26.172 --> 08:28.379
adjustments will have to be made,
and I need Joe's help.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.835
What about Sam?

08:30.010 --> 08:31.966
I went back to the bomb shelter,
he wasn't there.

08:32.137 --> 08:35.925
I gave Sam a choice,
he can either live among us or...

08:36.558 --> 08:38.173
die with the Resistance.

08:40.770 --> 08:44.638
Christine?
I thought the cocoon healed you.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.522
It did.

08:46.693 --> 08:50.151
- Where are you going?
- The dome wall. I need to see it.

08:54.034 --> 08:57.071
You don't have to be here
if you don't wanna be.

08:57.537 --> 09:01.075
No. Keeping my mind busy helps.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.995
What the hell is this thing
supposed to be anyway?

09:05.170 --> 09:07.786
I think these oscillating lines
are sound waves.

09:08.131 --> 09:11.498
In that cocoon world, I learned
how sound can be used as energy.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.792
I just don't remember how.

09:14.679 --> 09:15.964
You ever hear of a library?

09:18.016 --> 09:19.847
They're filled
with these things called books.

09:20.018 --> 09:22.634
You read them once in a while,
they tend to answer your questions.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.928
You want us to go to the library
on a mission?

09:25.106 --> 09:28.644
Well, if it keeps us one step ahead
of Christine, you're damn straight.

09:29.486 --> 09:32.694
She said she had a way
to bring the dome down.

09:32.864 --> 09:36.732
I didn't believe her.
Seeing that thing...

09:37.202 --> 09:39.113
I think
maybe she was telling the truth.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.699
- We'll get our stuff and go.
- Hey, listen, guys.

09:41.873 --> 09:44.831

we're here, you understand?

Yeah.

10:04.229 --> 10:06.686

- Me...

while people are trying to kill us.

10:15.824 --> 10:18.156
Not exactly pulling one's weight.

10:19.202 --> 10:20.692
Look”.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.992
that recorder and then
those Aktaion files were coded,

10:25.166 --> 10:27.202
so that means they're important.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.208
I couldn't hack that.

10:29.379 --> 10:32.212
I'm pretty sure Julia, Norrie
and String Bean couldn't have either.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.337
So without you,
we don't know what Christine knows.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.837

to stop Christine.

- did you not understand?
- No.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.643
Not while there's still a way
to save Barbie.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.804
You mean the same Barbie
who burned down a house

11:30.982 --> 11:32.313
trying to find us? That Barbie?

11:32.859 --> 11:35.066
There's no way to reach Barbie.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.898
Or my son.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.907
They're just gone.

11:43.077 --> 11:47.116
Hunter, Carolyn, they were taken over
by the Life Force,

11:47.290 --> 11:48.700
but fought their way back.

11:48.875 --> 11:53.209
Yeah, I tried that emotion stuff
with Junior. Heh.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.214
It didn't work.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.005
Maybe that's because
we were only half right.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.502
Norrie just told me
that after the explosion hurt Carolyn,

12:01.679 --> 12:03.055
she became human again.

12:04.390 --> 12:08.929
What if physical pain suppresses
the Life Force,

12:09.103 --> 12:11.185
allowing emotion to overcome it?

12:12.190 --> 12:14.226
What if you're wrong?

12:16.653 --> 12:18.018
We do it your way.

Yesterday, when you asked me...

14:03.843 --> 14:05.424
if I loved Eva,

14:05.595 --> 14:07.176
I didn't know what to say.

14:08.514 --> 14:12.382
I have not been able to get
that question out of my head.

14:12.894 --> 14:16.853
And that's when everything,
when you, me, Eva,

14:17.023 --> 14:19.480
that all became clear.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.892
I realized that whatever I felt for her,
it isn't real.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.938
- Barbie--
- Christine and Eva were using me,

14:26.115 --> 14:29.607
and I am so, so sorry

14:29.786 --> 14:31.697
that I couldn't see that.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.408
For not believing you.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.380
Oh, it's really you. You're back.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.257
I missed you so much.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.632
We have got to stop them.
Christine is crazy.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.886
But I think I can get close enough
to her to end this.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.426
Oh, I wish
you hadn't had done that.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.313
- What did you do?
- It's for your own good.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.406
Nice work, Dexter.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.741
Help me get him back to the cabin.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.546
CHRISTINE:
Oh, no, it's begun.

15:26.134 --> 15:28.250
The dome's surface is calcifying.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.215
Soon every living thing
won't be able to breathe

15:31.389 --> 15:33.505
unless I can bring down the dome
with Joe's help.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.548
I don't understand.
How is what's happening

15:35.726 --> 15:38.388
- making you weaker?
- Because I'm connected to it.

15:38.563 --> 15:41.350
And with the egg destroyed
and one remaining amethyst,

15:41.524 --> 15:44.186
the dome has no power source.
It's shutting down.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.485
Christine? Christine!

16:08.593 --> 16:10.925
You recognize this place, don't you?

16:11.095 --> 16:12.596
Julia, what the hell?

16:12.763 --> 16:13.969
Where you murdered my husband.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.131
Oh, come on, you got this all wrong.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.553
Look, I'm not like Christine
and Eva anymore.

16:18.728 --> 16:22.471
Whatever was in me,
it's gone, I swear.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.813
Well, that almost sounded convincing.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.439
JULIA:
Almost.

16:29.614 --> 16:32.230
Except for the knife
hidden in your boot.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.486
What the hell is he doing here?

16:39.290 --> 16:41.622
He's gonna help me fight
whatever's inside of you.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.589
- Probably gonna hurt.
- Julia, think about what you're doing.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.629
Please don't do this!

- No, don't.

- What can I do?
- This.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.867
- No. No more.
- Barbie?

17:23.292 --> 17:25.874
Barbie, focus on my voice.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.706
Think about everything
we've been through.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.462
I know you can fight this.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.173
Julia...

17:34.136 --> 17:36.798
That's it. That's it. I'm right here.

[LAUGHING]

17:43.688 --> 17:45.144
I knew it.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.937
Oh, I'm sorry. Ha, ha.

17:55.908 --> 17:59.696
But the two of you,
working together...

18:01.872 --> 18:03.248
that is priceless.

18:06.502 --> 18:10.370
There's just one problem...

18:10.548 --> 18:13.164
with your whole plan here.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.042
You've lost.

18:19.557 --> 18:22.264
I'm part of the Kinship now.

18:23.853 --> 18:25.184
And I'm with Eva.

18:28.441 --> 18:32.150
And nothing you do
is gonna change that.

18:35.072 --> 18:37.108
She's having my baby.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.366

18:50.796 --> 18:53.082
Though, in all fairness,

18:53.924 --> 18:56.506
I just found out this morning.

18:56.677 --> 18:59.464
So, hey, go ahead,
use your new pal here

18:59.639 --> 19:03.757
to torture me all you want
because every time you do,

19:04.393 --> 19:07.009
all it does is remind me how much

19:07.188 --> 19:10.305
I don't want you in my life anymore.

19:13.778 --> 19:16.986
- What are you doing?
- He's right, it's over. It's too late.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.147
No, there is still time.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.862
Hey, Jim, you wouldn't happen
to have any parenting tips?

19:23.037 --> 19:24.322
Would you?

19:24.497 --> 19:26.738
Because you did such a great job
with Junior.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.372
- Shut up.
- Why do you think

19:28.542 --> 19:31.534
he was the first one to fall in line
with the Kinship anyway?

19:33.422 --> 19:35.378
- Jim!
- Junior's weak.

19:35.549 --> 19:38.916
Or he saw you...

19:39.679 --> 19:44.594
for what Julia is now so willing
to look past.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.559
That you are a sad,

19:48.729 --> 19:51.436
pathetic, cold-blooded killer.

Jim, that's enough.

[LAUGHING]

20:04.912 --> 20:06.152
What the hell are you doing?

20:06.330 --> 20:09.242
The plan was to suppress
the Life Force in Barbie, not kill him.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.248
Been doing this for hours.
He's toying with us.

20:11.419 --> 20:12.625
You think I don't see that?

20:12.795 --> 20:14.410
He's trying to pit us
against each other.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.417
You really think he and Eva
got a cosmic bun in the oven?

20:17.591 --> 20:18.842
Who knows anything anymore?

20:19.009 --> 20:21.261
This pain thing's not working.
Time to do things my way.

20:21.429 --> 20:23.090
No, I'm not giving up on Barbie.

20:23.264 --> 20:26.097
Hey, I know that I can do this, all right?
I just need to do it alone.

20:26.267 --> 20:28.679
And you're willing to do
whatever it takes?

- What's this?
- Backup.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.359
Indy wouldn't let Christine
anywhere near him.

If you can't change Barbie back,
he'll know.

What are you gonna do?

20:45.703 --> 20:47.568
Plan B.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.913
All right, it should be down here.

20:57.631 --> 21:01.749
What about The Truth Hertz,
A Fun Guide to Sound?

21:01.927 --> 21:03.758
Even books with lame-ass titles
could probably

21:03.929 --> 21:05.510
tell us something about that sketch.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.637
So you think Big Jim is right.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.639
This is the way
to take down the dome?

21:09.810 --> 21:12.142
The military has devices
that can immobilize armies

21:12.313 --> 21:13.644
using sonar technology.

21:13.814 --> 21:16.726
So, yeah, I guess sound
could be used as a weapon.

21:16.901 --> 21:21.019
But what if it's not a weapon?
What if it's, like, a beacon?

21:21.489 --> 21:23.229
"Kinship phone home."

No, but I thought you were my mate.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.870
What you and I have
is beyond mating.

22:18.379 --> 22:20.165
But Barbie and Eva,
they're together.

22:20.339 --> 22:24.207
- I figured that you and |--

to be with each other,

or a stroll.

Maybe he went to kill Eva.

Like your fellow soldiers?

the reporter in me really has to ask,

24:08.405 --> 24:10.817
was it really friendly fire
that killed them

or were you just having
a really bad day?

what I am capable of.

Most guys go back to their lives,
go back to their families.

You became a debt collector,

24:43.399 --> 24:44.809
killing anyone who didn't pay up.

24:44.984 --> 24:48.147
So is that what the Kinship
wants you to be? A killer?

What were my husband's last words?

Did he beg for his life
before you shot him?

25:02.084 --> 25:04.370
You know he wanted me to kill him.

25:05.045 --> 25:08.583
Or maybe you forced him to sign over
those life insurance papers.

25:09.258 --> 25:11.044
Was that the plan this whole time?

25:11.218 --> 25:15.587

he's the real head of Aktaion.

secretly running it the whole time.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.241
Why would he hide his involvement?

30:34.416 --> 30:35.872
Maybe because, from what I can tell,

the government has their hand
so far up him, he's a Muppet.

32:41.209 --> 32:43.586
Christine never talked
about building something

32:43.753 --> 32:45.493
that could bring down the dome?

32:45.672 --> 32:47.412
This can bring down the dome?

32:47.591 --> 32:49.957
I'm not sure yet,
but if these lines are sound waves,

32:50.135 --> 32:52.751
see how they're all directed
to this point where they're expanding?

32:52.929 --> 32:55.966
I would think that that focal point would
have to be some sort of amplifier.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.427
Why would Christine need
to amplify sound inside the dome?

32:58.602 --> 32:59.967
I was wondering that too.

attempt to destroy the dome

33:03.523 --> 33:05.229
has come from the outside.
