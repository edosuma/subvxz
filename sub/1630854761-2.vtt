WEBVTT

00:05.171 --> 00:08.675
- Moving back, it's just gonna
be so good for you, for us.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.385
- Welcome to Landry Farm.

00:10.385 --> 00:13.096
- Your letter was so touching.
- Letter?

00:13.096 --> 00:14.431
What are you talking about?

00:14.431 --> 00:15.932
- I never asked for a new start!

00:15.932 --> 00:17.642
- Alice, please, stop!

00:17.642 --> 00:20.061
She does not know this town.

00:20.061 --> 00:22.480
- Alice will be fine.
- Well, Jacob wasn't.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.279
(coughing)

00:29.279 --> 00:32.615
- I'm Katherine Landry,
but everyone just calls me Kat.

00:32.615 --> 00:36.036
- If you ever need to talk,
I'm here. Any place, any time.

00:36.036 --> 00:40.081
- I need your help,
right here, right now.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.002
Hey, you reached Alice.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.379
Leave a message, or don't,
whatever.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.048
(beep)

00:48.048 --> 00:51.551
- Ali? It's me. Um...

00:51.551 --> 00:54.596
Please, just... just come home.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.514
Baby, I...

00:56.514 --> 00:58.475
you were right, okay?

00:58.475 --> 01:02.312
It... it was a mistake
to come here, but we can...

01:02.312 --> 01:05.565
We'll figure this out together,
okay? I... I love you.

01:05.565 --> 01:09.235
You are my everything, kiddo.
You know that?

01:09.235 --> 01:11.988
(eerie music)

01:11.988 --> 01:15.700
Okay, um... call me, okay?

01:15.700 --> 01:18.328
Please, just... bye.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.954
I... I love you.

01:22.415 --> 01:23.708
- Mom!

01:25.877 --> 01:27.587
- Hey! Have you heard from her?

01:27.587 --> 01:29.923
- No. I was hoping you had.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.383
- Where the hell is she, Brady?

01:31.383 --> 01:33.968
- She's hiding somewhere, okay?

01:33.968 --> 01:37.222
You told her about Rachel
and she reacted.

01:37.222 --> 01:40.183
I should have told her,
Kat. I'm really sorry.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.936
(breathing heavily)

01:42.936 --> 01:47.273
Kat? Hey, just pull over.
Okay? Take a breath.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.942
- I can't do this again.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.444
I can't do this again!
What if she's gone?

01:51.444 --> 01:52.654
(sigh)

01:52.654 --> 01:54.280
- Hey, this isn't Jacob.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.157
Okay? Alice is fine.

01:57.283 --> 01:58.660
It's not like then.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.370
(sobbing)

02:00.370 --> 02:03.790
Do you hear me, Kat? Kat?

02:03.790 --> 02:05.500
Kat?

02:06.793 --> 02:09.587
Kat? Hello?

02:09.587 --> 02:11.673
Tell me what your plan is.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.758
And where's Del?

02:13.758 --> 02:16.136
Kat? Kat?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.513
(deep exhale)
- She's been out all night

02:18.513 --> 02:21.933
searching too...
only because I asked.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.729
You know Mom.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.522
Nothing fazes her.

02:29.649 --> 02:32.402
- Appreciate you keeping
an eye out, Chief Adams.

02:32.402 --> 02:35.613
It's probably just a teenage
cry for attention.

02:37.032 --> 02:41.036
Yeah. Right. Thanks.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.626
(soft flute music)

02:57.385 --> 03:00.388
- It's not that I don't believe
you, it's just...

03:00.388 --> 03:02.557
well, when somebody tells you
that they've travelled

03:02.557 --> 03:05.852
through time, you need to look
at it from all of the angles.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.479
And you need evidence.

03:07.479 --> 03:09.898
- What do you want, my DNA?
- Could you?

03:11.107 --> 03:12.317
(clears throat)
Sorry.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.277
Um... why don't you tell me

03:14.277 --> 03:16.321
something else
about the future, then?

03:16.321 --> 03:19.532
Okay, wait, there is no way
that guy becomes president.

03:21.659 --> 03:25.538
So, this is... your portal, huh?

03:25.538 --> 03:27.707
- Well, when you say it
like that, it sounds dumb,

03:27.707 --> 03:30.669
but yeah, I...
fell in and came up here,

03:30.669 --> 03:33.922
so maybe if I jump back in,
I'll come up back home.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.592
- Seems logical.

03:37.592 --> 03:40.136
Also insane.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.180
- You believe me in my time,

03:42.180 --> 03:43.682
and you basically told me
this would happen

03:43.682 --> 03:45.266
and that you'd help.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.394
I know you in the future.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.770
(chuckling)
- Right.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.564
Uh... so, if you're Kat's kid
in the future,

03:51.564 --> 03:55.902
then... well, who's your dad?

03:55.902 --> 03:59.280
- Ew! Obviously not you, dude!
You're just my science teacher.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.325
Okay.
(deep exhale)

04:02.325 --> 04:05.120
I just... have to be brave.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.916
If I go in and I don't come up,

04:09.916 --> 04:11.751
will that be enough
proof for you?

04:11.751 --> 04:15.922
- Maybe. Or you'll just be dead
at the bottom of the pond.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.632
- You're gonna take me
seriously, someday,

04:17.632 --> 04:20.427
sometime, promise.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.813
- Alice?

04:33.064 --> 04:35.817
Alice? Alice!

04:41.865 --> 04:43.158
Alice!

04:44.367 --> 04:45.660
Alice!

04:47.996 --> 04:50.790
Alice! Ah! Alice!

04:50.790 --> 04:53.626
Where are you! Alice!

04:53.626 --> 04:55.920
Where are you?

05:08.641 --> 05:11.353
***

05:31.122 --> 05:33.875
- Jacob's out there,
and we'll find him.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.961
(sobbing)

05:36.961 --> 05:38.380
Oh, sweetheart.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.716
A Landry never gives up hope.

05:43.259 --> 05:45.220
(deep exhale)

06:02.946 --> 06:06.783
- Oh, thank God! Ali. Thank God!

06:06.783 --> 06:09.202
- Mom, I'm so sorry.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.163
- What happened? Where were you?

06:12.163 --> 06:16.626
- I... I was here, but I...
I didn't mean to go, honest.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.628
And I was just trying
to find my way back home.

06:18.628 --> 06:21.506
- Wait, you... you were
trying to get back to Dad?

06:21.506 --> 06:22.841
- What? No.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.300
- What were you going to do?

06:24.300 --> 06:25.927
You were going to hitchhike?

06:25.927 --> 06:27.387
I mean, seriously, Alice?

06:27.387 --> 06:28.972
- No! And look,
it doesn't matter,

06:28.972 --> 06:31.766
I'm back and we're both
here now

06:31.766 --> 06:33.351
and I think everything's
gonna be okay!

06:33.351 --> 06:35.437
- Do you...

06:35.437 --> 06:38.982
have any idea what
you put me through

06:38.982 --> 06:41.985
these past 12 hours?

06:41.985 --> 06:46.614
And your grandmother? What...
For some selfish stunt?

06:46.614 --> 06:48.950
- It wasn't a stunt,
I don't know what it was!

06:48.950 --> 06:50.368
I just... I'm back, okay?

06:50.368 --> 06:52.328
- When are you going to grow up

06:52.328 --> 06:55.790
and realize that your actions
have consequences?

06:57.542 --> 06:58.918
- What happened to you?

07:01.254 --> 07:03.214
- I can ask you
the same question.

07:06.676 --> 07:07.969
(Kat crying)

07:13.266 --> 07:15.477
Get dressed...

07:15.477 --> 07:17.228
and get in the car.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.314
You're going to be going
to school,

07:19.314 --> 07:22.734
and that is it
for a very long time!

07:22.734 --> 07:25.236
You are so grounded!

07:26.738 --> 07:29.491
- You're not gonna solve this
by locking me away!

07:29.491 --> 07:31.451
(door slams)

07:31.451 --> 07:33.578
(sigh)

07:33.578 --> 07:35.789
(footsteps approaching)

07:38.541 --> 07:40.627
- See, I told you
she'd come home.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.128
- Don't.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.635
(door closes)

07:48.635 --> 07:52.013
(indistinct whispers)

07:54.599 --> 07:56.935
- Alice! Oh, my God,
you're here!

07:56.935 --> 07:59.354
- Uh... yeah. I am.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.273
Okay, what is going on?

08:02.273 --> 08:04.484
- We all heard you went missing.
- Oh, God.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.444
- No, it's okay,
and running away

08:06.444 --> 08:07.946
is so much better than arson.

08:07.946 --> 08:09.948
- I never set fire to anything.

08:09.948 --> 08:11.783
- We're just glad you're okay.

08:11.783 --> 08:16.121
- Thanks, but honestly,
I'm fine.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.747
- Wait, wait.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.374
I wanted to show you this.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.167
My mom showed it to me.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.752
That's her,
right next to your mom.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.630
Crazy, right?
They're so different, now.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.050
- I mean, I would just like
to know if that girl

08:29.050 --> 08:31.094
gave any thought at all
to what disappearing

08:31.094 --> 08:32.929
would do to your whole...
- Rita, it's over.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.807
She came home. I knew she would.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.308
She's just like Kat.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.477
All drama, no delivery.

08:39.477 --> 08:42.397
- Del, you can't be so naive

08:42.397 --> 08:44.315
as to think that your life's
gonna go back to normal

08:44.315 --> 08:46.443
now that those two have invaded!

08:46.443 --> 08:49.654
I mean, look at last night,
for heaven's sake!

08:49.654 --> 08:51.448
It was like some...

08:51.448 --> 08:53.533
(sighs)
...some sick deja vu.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.534
(sighs)

08:54.534 --> 08:55.910
Look, I'm just saying

08:55.910 --> 08:58.413
they could ruin all
of the good solid healing

08:58.413 --> 09:00.123
that you've done.

09:00.123 --> 09:03.043
That you're about to do.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.211
Did you even tell Kat
about this weekend?

09:05.211 --> 09:07.005
- I will, when I'm ready.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.883
- I can't believe
she came home now.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.177
- Well, she came home

09:12.177 --> 09:14.596
because somebody
sent her my letter.

09:16.181 --> 09:18.141
- Oh, no, come on, it wasn't me!

09:18.141 --> 09:21.102
You think I would stick my nose
into all this messy business?

09:21.102 --> 09:22.854
Look, it doesn't matter
who sent it,

09:22.854 --> 09:25.357
I can see clear as day
that it's gonna cause trouble.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.942
And if your daughter
pushes you back

09:27.942 --> 09:30.028
just when you're about
to take this giant leap forward,

09:30.028 --> 09:31.196
she'll answer to me.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.910
(birds chirping)

09:41.206 --> 09:43.792
(phone ringing)

09:45.001 --> 09:46.586
(deep exhale)

09:48.338 --> 09:49.839
- Hey.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.049
- Any sign of her?

09:51.049 --> 09:53.385
- I was just about to call.

09:53.385 --> 09:54.803
She's... she's back.

09:54.803 --> 09:58.807
- Oh, my God!
Oh... can I talk to her?

09:58.807 --> 10:04.062
- Um... I already dropped her
off at school, actually, so...

10:04.062 --> 10:06.314
- You had time
to take her to school?

10:06.314 --> 10:08.191
- I know, I know, I'm...

10:08.191 --> 10:09.901
I'm sorry, I forgot to call,

10:09.901 --> 10:12.654
it's been an emotional morning.

10:13.697 --> 10:16.116
(sigh)
- Yeah. It's fine.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.576
Honestly, it's fine,
as long as Alice is okay.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.538
- Maybe we should
just come home.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.581
I mean, it's obviously
not working here.

10:23.581 --> 10:24.958
Alice tried to
make a break for it,

10:24.958 --> 10:26.876
and mom and I
are barely speaking.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.879
- Well, I may have
a reason for you to stay.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.924
I found out yesterday, but then,
everything happened with Alice.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.093
- What's going on?

10:35.093 --> 10:36.553
- I was talking to this
publishing house

10:36.553 --> 10:38.346
that our firm represents.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.306
I was telling them about,
you know, your journey home

10:40.306 --> 10:42.434
in the wake of a family tragedy.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.437
They want you to write about it,

10:45.437 --> 10:47.939
like about Jacob,
about everything.

10:47.939 --> 10:50.608
You know, one of those
cold case, true crime,

10:50.608 --> 10:52.360
family saga type things.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.364
Kat, you have a book deal...
if you want it.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.783
- Okay.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.660
Why are you doing this now?

11:00.660 --> 11:02.871
- What do you mean?
- Trying to help me

11:02.871 --> 11:05.540
in my career when...
we're not even...

11:05.540 --> 11:06.916
(sighs)

11:06.916 --> 11:09.711
I left, Brady.

11:09.711 --> 11:13.048
- Look, you didn't have
a story until you left, so...

11:13.048 --> 11:16.634
- Well, you are with
Rachel now, so...

11:16.634 --> 11:18.386
I can find my own book deals.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.014
- How's that working out
for you, Kat?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.766
(scoffs)

11:23.600 --> 11:26.353
Look, you know what,
you do what you want, okay?

11:28.146 --> 11:30.648
Just give it some thought, okay?

11:32.776 --> 11:34.652
Maybe you're home
for a bigger reason.

11:37.781 --> 11:40.325
- So tomorrow around eight?
- Yeah, sounds good.

11:40.325 --> 11:41.993
- We need to talk
about last night.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.379
- And coming at me like that,

11:52.379 --> 11:54.172
do you know what
that looked like?

11:54.172 --> 11:56.966
I'm lucky I wasn't fired,
or arrested!

11:56.966 --> 11:59.010
- Sorry, I'm... I'm just
really freaking out!

11:59.969 --> 12:01.763
- All right. Talk to me,

12:01.763 --> 12:05.016
but with this door
very, very open.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.978
(clears throat)
Proceed.

12:08.978 --> 12:13.608
- You told me that you'd help me
anytime and I think I know why.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.696
Do you know what I know?

12:17.696 --> 12:19.614
- Well, what do you know?

12:19.614 --> 12:21.032
- Well, I don't know
what I can say.

12:21.032 --> 12:23.493
What if it causes
some big time paradox thingy

12:23.493 --> 12:25.036
and then, the universe implodes?

12:25.036 --> 12:26.454
- Okay.

12:27.997 --> 12:31.334
I know what you know.
I was there, Alice.

12:32.127 --> 12:34.129
I remember.

12:34.129 --> 12:37.674
- Okay, so... I did time travel

12:37.674 --> 12:41.094
and I'm Alice
like my mom's friend Alice,

12:41.094 --> 12:43.638
but also me Alice.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.432
- You are one and the same.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.933
- Well, how does my mom
not see that?

12:46.933 --> 12:50.145
She... She named me after... me.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.606
- Memories are mercurial.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.692
Your mom's seen you grow
and change since birth.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.610
Also, she doesn't see it
because it's... well,

12:57.610 --> 12:59.446
technically impossible, so...

12:59.446 --> 13:01.990
- But you believe me now even
though you didn't this morning?

13:01.990 --> 13:04.659
- Well, that morning
was two decades ago,

13:04.659 --> 13:06.703
but yes, I remember.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.163
You went in that pond
and didn't come out,

13:08.163 --> 13:09.789
and then, I started to believe.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.834
(chuckling)
I even tried following. No luck.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.919
Time travel only works for you.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.505
- Why me?

13:17.505 --> 13:19.549
- I wish I knew.

13:19.549 --> 13:22.552
But the pond
has no explanations, only rules,

13:22.552 --> 13:24.095
and I bet you
figured out the big one.

13:24.095 --> 13:26.097
The amount of time you're gone
from now is equal

13:26.097 --> 13:31.227
to the time you spend back then,
so from now on,

13:31.227 --> 13:33.229
be smart about
when you take your trips.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.482
Pick times when you're not
missed much here.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.317
- Wait, wait... I go back?

13:37.317 --> 13:40.904
I... that wasn't just
a one time thing?

13:40.904 --> 13:43.239
When... when do I go back?
And what... what happens?

13:43.239 --> 13:45.617
- Okay! Well, thanks
for dropping by.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.118
- I... I met Jacob.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.374
He was really special,
wasn't he?

13:53.083 --> 13:54.959
- Yes, he was.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.546
I'll see you later.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.632
(indistinct chatter)

14:16.731 --> 14:19.526
- You be the reporter
and I'll be your photographer.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.778
Like a team, solving cases.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.072
We'll be heroes,

14:24.072 --> 14:25.949
and heroes always
leave their mark.

14:25.949 --> 14:29.953
See? J and K to the rescue!
(laughing)

14:32.372 --> 14:33.748
- What are you doing?

14:34.749 --> 14:36.793
- Oh, well, I'm glad to see

14:36.793 --> 14:39.045
that you didn't
throw it all away.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.505
Do you remember this?

14:40.505 --> 14:41.923
- I do.

14:41.923 --> 14:43.800
Now, you can... put it away.

14:45.635 --> 14:49.097
- Can't you just sit here
with me?

14:49.097 --> 14:52.434
Talk about him? Please?

14:52.434 --> 14:55.353
(sighs)
- Let's talk about you.

14:55.353 --> 14:58.606
Last night, you said you were
thinking about leaving.

14:58.606 --> 15:01.317
- Well, if you and I can't be
open and honest with each other,

15:01.317 --> 15:03.069
then maybe I just should leave.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.613
- It is always all or nothing
with you.

15:05.613 --> 15:08.074
You can never meet
someone halfway.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.660
- Well, it's pretty
all or nothing with you too,

15:10.660 --> 15:13.496
especially when it comes
to Jake... and Dad.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.498
(sighs)

15:15.498 --> 15:19.002
- I am tired of talking
in circles, Katherine.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.004
You don't have a job!

15:21.004 --> 15:23.173
You have nowhere to go.

15:23.173 --> 15:25.967
So, while you figure
yourself out,

15:25.967 --> 15:28.636
I suggest you make
yourself useful.

15:32.057 --> 15:33.683
- Okay.

15:37.312 --> 15:38.730
Hi.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.233
- Kat Landry?

15:42.233 --> 15:45.445
- Monica. Wow! I...

15:45.445 --> 15:46.988
You work here now?

15:46.988 --> 15:49.407
- I own it. Crazy, right?

15:49.407 --> 15:52.577
Now, when is the last time
we saw each other?

15:52.577 --> 15:54.454
High school grad?

15:54.454 --> 16:00.043
Oh, my God, time flies!
And you look... good.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.214
- Uh... yeah, I brought
Mom's honey over, so...

16:04.214 --> 16:06.675
- Great, we can't keep
this stuff in stock.

16:06.675 --> 16:09.219
And it is so cute, you being
Del's little assistant and all.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.929
Come.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.430
Sit.

16:13.390 --> 16:16.267
So, have you kept in touch
with anyone from school?

16:16.267 --> 16:18.645
- I'm still super close
with Elliot

16:18.645 --> 16:20.063
since he moved back,

16:20.063 --> 16:23.066
and I'm also very in touch
with Trevor Hill.

16:23.066 --> 16:26.361
(laughing)
- Spillski?

16:26.361 --> 16:29.656
That guy was
such a klutz, right?

16:29.656 --> 16:33.326
And he... he actually made it
to adulthood? That's...

16:33.326 --> 16:35.120
What is that guy
up to these days?

16:35.120 --> 16:36.996
- He's married...

16:36.996 --> 16:38.915
to me.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.542
- No kidding!

16:41.501 --> 16:44.379
Well, congrats!
That's, um... that's great.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.631
All I wanted to do
is just get out of here.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.883
(chuckling)
- Yes. And now, you're back.

16:48.883 --> 16:51.136
So, let's talk experience, huh?

16:51.136 --> 16:52.512
- I'm sorry?

16:52.512 --> 16:53.972
- Or you could just give me
your resume

16:53.972 --> 16:55.640
and I could look it over?

16:55.640 --> 16:58.018
- Is this like a job interview?

16:58.018 --> 17:00.478
- Del didn't say?
She set this up.

17:00.478 --> 17:03.314
She told me about you
getting fired.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.525
Ugh. And I said, "You know what?
I'll help a girl out."

17:05.525 --> 17:07.277
I always need wait staff, so...
- No, no, no,

17:07.277 --> 17:09.362
I... I don't need a job.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.073
I've landed a book deal.

17:12.073 --> 17:14.200
- Mm.
- So, yeah, right?

17:14.200 --> 17:15.660
(chuckling)

17:15.660 --> 17:17.829
- Sorry, I guess
I misunderstood, then.

17:17.829 --> 17:19.456
- Yes, you did.

17:19.456 --> 17:23.585
So, if you will excuse me,
I'm just gonna...

17:23.585 --> 17:27.130
- Do you need a pen? Some paper?

17:28.715 --> 17:30.383
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.177
- Great service.
- Mm-hmm.

17:34.471 --> 17:36.389
(birds chirping)

17:36.389 --> 17:40.810
- How was school?
- It was... you know, school.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.645
- It was nice of
Zoey and Spencer

17:42.645 --> 17:44.606
to get you a ride home.
They're good kids.

17:44.606 --> 17:46.316
- Maybe that'll rub off on you.

17:48.985 --> 17:51.571
You know, I had a nice little
catch-up with my high school

17:51.571 --> 17:53.448
nemesis when I dropped
off your honey.

17:53.448 --> 17:55.367
- Only trying to help
you get back on your feet.

17:55.367 --> 17:57.744
- By throwing me under the bus?

17:57.744 --> 17:59.954
I mean, why did you tell Monica
that I don't have a job?

17:59.954 --> 18:01.456
- Because you don't.

18:01.456 --> 18:04.709
- Actually, I do. I...

18:07.337 --> 18:10.256
I got an offer
to write a book.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.175
- Seriously? About what?

18:13.551 --> 18:17.514
- Jacob... and that time.

18:17.514 --> 18:18.807
- Why would you do that?

18:18.807 --> 18:20.725
- I guess it could be cathartic.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.811
This is a book!

18:22.811 --> 18:25.313
I mean... it's my dream!

18:25.313 --> 18:27.899
- It's wrong
and you can't do it.

18:30.402 --> 18:32.737
- Okay, can someone tell me
what happened to Jacob?

18:32.737 --> 18:34.030
How he went missing?

18:34.030 --> 18:35.365
- Now is not
the right time, Alice.

18:35.365 --> 18:37.033
- Really? But it's a fine time

18:37.033 --> 18:38.493
to write a family
tell-all about it?

18:41.037 --> 18:43.164
You guys used to love
each other.

18:43.164 --> 18:44.582
You were happy.

18:45.375 --> 18:46.918
What happened?

18:46.918 --> 18:48.461
- That is a damn good question.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.296
- I think we both know
why we are exactly

18:50.296 --> 18:52.298
the way we are.
- Maybe,

18:52.298 --> 18:53.925
but the world doesn't,

18:53.925 --> 18:55.510
so don't write that book!

19:00.974 --> 19:02.559
(insects chirping)

19:05.562 --> 19:07.147
- Thanks for the text.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.690
- Thank you for bringing
the wine.

19:08.690 --> 19:10.275
(chuckling)

19:14.070 --> 19:16.114
Um...

19:16.114 --> 19:21.077
Alice asked about...
Jacob, at dinner.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.580
- She was bound to.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.291
(sighs)

19:27.584 --> 19:30.378
- Sorry, is this weird?
- No, no, it's fine.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.340
It's how we were.

19:33.340 --> 19:36.468
- It's easy to fall
into old habits. Memories.

19:38.094 --> 19:41.222
Hey, do you remember
our friend Alice?

19:41.222 --> 19:44.267
- Oh... yeah, sort of.

19:44.267 --> 19:46.644
- I found a polaroid
of me and her.

19:46.644 --> 19:49.773
You know, that...
summer and fall,

19:49.773 --> 19:51.608
like, she was a part
of all of it.

19:51.608 --> 19:54.194
- You say you have
a photo of her?

19:54.194 --> 19:58.698
- Yeah, it's blurry,
so I can't make her out...

19:58.698 --> 20:02.369
Which is fitting because Alice
seems more like an energy to me

20:02.369 --> 20:05.413
now than a person.

20:05.413 --> 20:07.582
It's funny how memories are.

20:07.582 --> 20:09.501
- I will drink to that.

20:19.678 --> 20:22.263
(phone ringing)

20:26.309 --> 20:28.395
- Dad, I'll talk when I'm ready.

20:28.395 --> 20:32.273
- Okay, um... look, I know
you're angry, Ali, I just...

20:33.817 --> 20:35.985
It's just really good to hear
your voice.

20:35.985 --> 20:37.737
I was worried sick.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.115
- Not worried enough to tell me
to come home, though.

20:40.115 --> 20:41.783
- It's complicated, kiddo.

20:41.783 --> 20:45.036
But hey, there's room in the new
place for you, always!

20:46.204 --> 20:49.791
- Yeah. A place
for me and for Rachel.

20:49.791 --> 20:51.710
- Yeah, and for Rachel.

20:52.544 --> 20:53.795
- Okay.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.505
Uh... well, thanks,

20:55.505 --> 20:57.716
but I actually have to go.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.467
- Alice, please...
- Homework.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.136
- But if we could
just talk about--

21:09.936 --> 21:13.231
(enchanting music)

21:29.039 --> 21:31.833
(panting)

21:48.808 --> 21:51.853
(crying)

22:07.285 --> 22:09.037
- It didn't work!

22:09.037 --> 22:10.914
- What?
- The time travel. It...

22:10.914 --> 22:12.707
You said I go back, but I can't.

22:12.707 --> 22:15.210
The pond won't let me
and I need to know why!

22:15.210 --> 22:18.254
- I don't know, honestly.

22:18.254 --> 22:20.465
- Okay, aren't you supposed
to be my guru or whatever?

22:20.465 --> 22:21.883
- Give a guy a little time to be

22:21.883 --> 22:23.510
the Giles to your Buffy,
all right?

22:23.510 --> 22:26.304
- The who to my what?
- Ugh... I cry for Gen Z.

22:26.304 --> 22:28.014
- What if I mess something up?

22:28.014 --> 22:30.225
You said I could go back,
but what if me telling you

22:30.225 --> 22:32.519
my secret in the present
has ruined my chances

22:32.519 --> 22:33.645
in the past, somehow?

22:33.645 --> 22:35.021
- Calm down.

22:35.021 --> 22:39.442
The pond works
in mysterious ways.

22:39.442 --> 22:42.821
It sends you when and where
it wants you to go.

22:42.821 --> 22:44.280
- Okay, so what are you saying?

22:44.280 --> 22:46.408
- Maybe it wasn't
your time to go.

22:46.408 --> 22:49.244
Maybe you need to spend
a little time here.

22:56.334 --> 22:58.211
- You're an early riser.

22:58.211 --> 22:59.921
That'll come in handy.

23:05.135 --> 23:07.262
(light music)

23:09.097 --> 23:10.974
- Thanks so much!

23:10.974 --> 23:14.728
Have a great day.
Oh, honey, put it right here.

23:14.728 --> 23:17.856
- Well, well, well,
morning, all!

23:17.856 --> 23:19.441
- Morning, Rita. How's it going?

23:19.441 --> 23:22.277
- Eh, a little slow start,
but it'll pick up.

23:22.277 --> 23:24.154
Summer folk love
their sleep-ins, right?

23:24.154 --> 23:27.866
- Hey, Rita? This is my
granddaughter, Alice.

23:27.866 --> 23:30.035
- Glad to see you
found your way home.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.455
- Well, we've got a lot
to set up, here.

23:33.455 --> 23:36.249
- Oh, hey! New guy, 3 o'clock.
- Oh.

23:36.249 --> 23:39.461
- Morning, Delilah.
- Good morning, Byron.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.880
- So, what is good today?

23:41.880 --> 23:44.966
- Well, the carrots
are doing really well for us

23:44.966 --> 23:47.844
and the leeks
are especially sweet.

23:47.844 --> 23:50.263
- I'll bet. Sounds perfect.

23:50.263 --> 23:52.807
- Tomato's on me.
- Ah. Thank you.

23:54.517 --> 23:58.605
- Oh, this is my granddaughter,
Alice. Remember?

23:58.605 --> 24:01.024
I told you that
my daughter and she

24:01.024 --> 24:04.819
were coming to stay with me.
You know, just for... a while.

24:04.819 --> 24:07.280
- Pleased to meet
you at long last.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.074
- Please, Byron,
you just moved here.

24:09.074 --> 24:11.409
- Six years, Rita. Six years.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.286
- Byron runs the local paper,

24:13.286 --> 24:15.455
the Herald, and the archives.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.290
- Oh, yeah, that's really cool.

24:17.290 --> 24:19.626
- It's quiet.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.419
So, what do I owe you?

24:21.419 --> 24:25.799
- Ah, just give me a five.
- Oh, Del. Are you sure?

24:25.799 --> 24:28.593
- Byron, you know
I only gouge the tourists.

24:28.593 --> 24:30.303
(chuckling)

24:34.307 --> 24:36.768
- You're one
in a million, Delilah.

24:36.768 --> 24:39.145
Nice to meet you, Alice! Rita!

24:39.145 --> 24:40.480
- Mm-hmm.

24:41.898 --> 24:43.650
(knocking on door)
- Ali?

24:52.325 --> 24:54.035
(deep exhale)

25:06.131 --> 25:08.466
(soft music)

25:23.898 --> 25:25.608
(sighs)

25:25.608 --> 25:27.068
(indistinct chatter)

25:33.616 --> 25:36.870
- Have you seen Jacob?
Please, help me find my son.

25:36.870 --> 25:39.122
My son Jacob is missing.
Help us get our Jacob back.

25:39.122 --> 25:40.665
- Please, help us, please.

25:41.499 --> 25:44.252
- Did I do something wrong?
- No, honey, just perfect.

25:45.420 --> 25:48.131
Katherine!
How nice of you to join us.

25:48.131 --> 25:50.133
- We need to talk.

25:50.133 --> 25:51.509
Why did you think you could
bring her here

25:51.509 --> 25:52.719
without even telling me?

25:52.719 --> 25:54.262
- We left you a note.

25:54.262 --> 25:56.306
(scoffs)
Don't overreact.

25:56.306 --> 25:58.058
- Don't interfere!

25:58.058 --> 26:00.101
She is my kid.

26:00.101 --> 26:02.937
- Well, you want your kid
to be happy?

26:02.937 --> 26:04.064
Don't lock her up.

26:04.064 --> 26:05.231
- You ask me,

26:05.231 --> 26:07.817
what all you Landrys
need is closure.

26:07.817 --> 26:10.195
- Can you tell me
what really happened to Jacob?

26:10.195 --> 26:12.072
How he went missing?

26:12.072 --> 26:13.907
- Uh...

26:13.907 --> 26:15.533
It's not for me to say.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.955
- You want Alice
to start a new life here.

26:20.955 --> 26:22.916
- Yeah.

26:22.916 --> 26:25.377
- But you're too busy dredging
up the past.

26:25.377 --> 26:26.628
It's selfish.

26:26.628 --> 26:28.254
- Selfish?

26:29.422 --> 26:31.633
You are the one that
is so worried

26:31.633 --> 26:35.053
about us invading your precious
independent life,

26:35.053 --> 26:36.554
and don't think
that I didn't notice

26:36.554 --> 26:38.598
your less than
warm welcome home.

26:38.598 --> 26:40.058
- I didn't ask you to come home.

26:41.184 --> 26:45.772
- Yes, you did!
I have the letter! And you...

26:45.772 --> 26:47.148
Typical.

27:07.085 --> 27:10.130
- Alice! How can I help you?

27:10.130 --> 27:13.466
- You're in charge
of the archives, right?

27:13.466 --> 27:15.343
(birds chirping)

27:18.638 --> 27:21.474
- Excuse me?
- Sorry.

27:21.474 --> 27:22.809
- No, no, no, wait, wait.

27:24.978 --> 27:26.146
Danny?

27:28.648 --> 27:31.526
Hi. It's... it's Kat.

27:32.861 --> 27:35.363
Landry. How are you?

27:36.656 --> 27:38.033
- Good.

27:49.627 --> 27:51.254
- Hi, Daddy.

27:52.213 --> 27:56.468
Yeah, I know, it's been
a while...

27:56.468 --> 27:58.136
and I'm sorry.

27:59.554 --> 28:01.890
But I'm home now and...

28:03.933 --> 28:06.519
Well, I...

28:06.519 --> 28:12.233
I have a daughter
and she's so much like you.

28:13.360 --> 28:18.323
She's musical
and she's smart and funny.

28:21.034 --> 28:22.994
And...

28:22.994 --> 28:24.579
I wish that you had met her.

28:26.790 --> 28:30.418
Because you would know
what to tell her.

28:31.878 --> 28:33.922
You always did with me.

28:36.383 --> 28:38.176
And I miss that.

28:48.895 --> 28:52.023
(tense music)

29:04.327 --> 29:07.372
(enchanting music)

29:49.205 --> 29:53.251
- "Sister Katherine told police
he was by her side one moment,

29:53.251 --> 29:54.461
gone the next."

29:54.461 --> 29:56.379
- Alice.

29:56.379 --> 29:57.672
It's time to go.

30:11.102 --> 30:13.271
- I'm sorry,
I just needed to know.

30:14.814 --> 30:16.483
- Do you see that?

30:16.483 --> 30:18.777
I drive by that every day.

30:20.779 --> 30:23.031
Do you see how close
it is to the farm?

30:24.282 --> 30:26.284
That's where my husband died...

30:27.577 --> 30:31.039
three months after Jacob
disappeared.

30:32.832 --> 30:35.126
In a car accident.

30:35.126 --> 30:39.464
I lost my whole world
in three months.

30:41.758 --> 30:43.885
- Your whole world
except for Mom.

30:45.136 --> 30:46.596
(sighs)

30:49.349 --> 30:51.434
- I realize...

30:51.434 --> 30:53.228
you deserve
to know what happened.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.899
But once you do,

30:57.899 --> 30:59.651
we have to be done with it.

31:01.403 --> 31:04.989
That is the only way
this is gonna work.

31:04.989 --> 31:06.574
- Yeah.

31:17.669 --> 31:19.963
(door creaking)

31:24.592 --> 31:26.094
- I went to the cemetery.

31:27.429 --> 31:30.015
You officially
declared Jacob dead.

31:32.475 --> 31:34.060
- It was time.

31:34.060 --> 31:36.771
That's... why I wrote
you the letter.

31:37.647 --> 31:39.858
I had...

31:39.858 --> 31:42.902
gotten his death certificate
and I felt you should know.

31:42.902 --> 31:44.904
- So, that's the letter
that you say you didn't send.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.823
- I didn't! I knew
how you would react.

31:46.823 --> 31:50.201
- Because a Landry
never gives up hope.

31:50.201 --> 31:53.371
- She does if she's the only
one left waiting.

31:53.371 --> 31:56.041
You left. I've been
waiting for Jacob

31:56.041 --> 31:57.292
to walk through that
door for 20 years

31:57.292 --> 31:58.793
and he's not coming home.

31:58.793 --> 32:00.211
- You don't get to decide that!

32:00.211 --> 32:02.881
- Yes, I do. I have to.

32:04.424 --> 32:07.510
- You are not the only one
who lost him,

32:07.510 --> 32:09.679
so stop acting like
I don't count

32:09.679 --> 32:11.306
because I'm the one
that you think--

32:11.306 --> 32:13.058
- Don't! Katherine,
don't do that!

32:16.353 --> 32:19.564
There's a small memorial
for Jacob tomorrow.

32:20.398 --> 32:22.442
The timing's not perfect,

32:22.442 --> 32:25.528
but Rita and I planned it
way before your arrival.

32:25.528 --> 32:28.490
- What? No, you...
you can't do that!

32:28.490 --> 32:30.992
- Do you think this was
an easy decision?

32:33.036 --> 32:36.414
You haven't been here
for 20 years

32:36.414 --> 32:38.041
of tears and heartache.

32:38.041 --> 32:39.834
- Because you wouldn't let me!

32:41.419 --> 32:45.757
I tried, Mom,
and you wouldn't let me.

32:47.217 --> 32:50.053
- This is a book
that I need to shut,

32:50.053 --> 32:53.723
so please,
stop trying to open it.

32:59.896 --> 33:02.440
(deep breath)

33:11.366 --> 33:13.618
- Thought I might find you here.
- Oh.

33:14.577 --> 33:16.496
Best place to get signal.

33:16.496 --> 33:18.289
Go figure.
(chuckling)

33:20.709 --> 33:22.711
Hey, did...

33:22.711 --> 33:24.921
did you know about tomorrow?

33:24.921 --> 33:27.757
- Yeah, I did.

33:27.757 --> 33:30.885
- Mom says that she wants
to have a fresh start.

33:30.885 --> 33:32.262
- Can you blame her?

33:32.262 --> 33:35.265
I mean, you got one,
when you left.

33:35.265 --> 33:37.142
- Yeah, but then, I came back.

33:37.142 --> 33:38.935
I... I don't know,
I thought that it would all

33:38.935 --> 33:41.021
just be waiting here.

33:41.021 --> 33:44.399
Not just the hurt, but the...

33:44.399 --> 33:49.446
the warmth, you know,
the heart, family.

33:49.446 --> 33:53.074
- It is, just different.

33:53.074 --> 33:56.202
(sighs)
- You divorced, you know,

33:56.202 --> 33:58.163
and then, you moved back,
so how did you do it?

33:58.163 --> 33:59.998
How did you start over?

33:59.998 --> 34:03.001
- Uh... honestly?
I didn't, really.

34:04.336 --> 34:05.795
No matter what I did out there,

34:05.795 --> 34:07.547
I always knew I'd
wind up back here.

34:07.547 --> 34:11.760
Wherever I went,
I had one foot in this town.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.428
Guess I never left.

34:17.432 --> 34:20.685
- A hero always leaves his mark.

34:24.522 --> 34:27.275
We were supposed to be a team.
- Hey.

34:27.275 --> 34:29.110
- I was supposed to protect him!

34:29.110 --> 34:31.738
(breathing heavily)

34:31.738 --> 34:33.698
- Shh...

34:37.118 --> 34:38.578
(door opens)

34:38.578 --> 34:39.996
- Hey.

34:39.996 --> 34:42.123
What are you doing up so late?

34:43.041 --> 34:45.043
- Del told me about
the memorial.

34:47.337 --> 34:49.422
- Yeah.

34:49.422 --> 34:52.384
- Do you ever wonder
what happened to him?

34:53.301 --> 34:56.471
- Every day since that day.

34:57.806 --> 35:03.937
- I know you're willing to leave
for me, but I want to stay.

35:03.937 --> 35:08.400
I want to get to know my family,
even the ones who are gone.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.902
(soft music)

35:13.029 --> 35:15.031
(birds chirping)

35:21.746 --> 35:23.248
(sighs)

35:26.126 --> 35:27.919
(laughing)

35:29.170 --> 35:31.089
- Wakey, wakey.

35:31.089 --> 35:32.882
- Jacob!
(laughing)

35:32.882 --> 35:34.342
Already?

35:34.342 --> 35:36.678
Where is the snooze button?

35:36.678 --> 35:38.888
Is it there?
Is the snooze button there?

35:38.888 --> 35:42.684
Did I sleep good?
I don't know. Did I?

35:42.684 --> 35:44.519
- Yes, you did.
(laughing)

35:46.813 --> 35:48.690
(deep exhale)

36:08.668 --> 36:10.378
- That's a family heirloom.

36:12.130 --> 36:15.008
When the Landrys first
settled here,

36:15.008 --> 36:16.676
they are the ones
that started it.

36:17.469 --> 36:19.387
And when a new family member
was born,

36:19.387 --> 36:21.056
they would add the name
to the list,

36:21.056 --> 36:23.767
and when they died,

36:23.767 --> 36:25.727
they would write down the date,

36:25.727 --> 36:28.605
close the book and move on.

36:28.605 --> 36:30.899
At least that was...
it was the idea.

36:33.068 --> 36:34.903
But they're always in here,

36:34.903 --> 36:37.197
if you just open up the book.

36:37.197 --> 36:39.741
- Hey. You ready for this?

36:41.743 --> 36:43.661
- Jacob loved these fields.

36:43.661 --> 36:47.332
One day they were Narnia,

36:47.332 --> 36:51.294
and another, the surface
of some far away planet.

36:53.088 --> 36:57.676
He dreamed...
big dreams, my boy.

37:01.179 --> 37:03.348
My perfect boy.

37:07.477 --> 37:10.480
- Jacob's time on earth
was short,

37:10.480 --> 37:13.316
but it was meaningful.

37:13.316 --> 37:15.694
He brought a light
and love to so many of us.

37:18.196 --> 37:22.325
- But now, it's time to say
goodbye, to let him go.

37:22.325 --> 37:23.993
(deep exhale)

37:28.456 --> 37:30.500
I have to do this, Jacob.

37:35.714 --> 37:38.508
Because I would rather remember
you in love...

37:40.135 --> 37:41.678
than in fear.

37:44.973 --> 37:47.017
Because he was love.

37:48.893 --> 37:50.228
My heart.

37:52.355 --> 37:54.024
My baby.

38:12.334 --> 38:14.586
- Well, I... I hope you
can understand, right?

38:14.586 --> 38:16.379
I mean, I just...

38:16.379 --> 38:18.173
I just can't do it, you know,

38:18.173 --> 38:21.760
not right now. Being here,
it's... it's too important.

38:21.760 --> 38:24.929
- But I don't get it, this book
deal could be huge for you, Kat.

38:24.929 --> 38:27.599
- Well, but it's not
just about me, now.

38:27.599 --> 38:31.853
You know, being here, it's...
it's about family.

38:31.853 --> 38:34.356
- So, you're officially
staying, then?

38:34.356 --> 38:35.982
- Yeah.

38:35.982 --> 38:37.275
(indistinct shouting)

38:37.275 --> 38:39.319
Yeah, and who knows?

38:39.319 --> 38:41.654
Maybe I'll get to see
the best part of my history

38:41.654 --> 38:43.198
repeat itself.

38:43.198 --> 38:44.949
(barking)

38:49.913 --> 38:51.623
- Going somewhere?

38:51.623 --> 38:54.417
- I have to see Jacob.
I have to try.

38:55.293 --> 38:57.295
I just don't get how
I can miss someone

38:57.295 --> 39:00.465
that I barely know,
but here I am.

39:00.465 --> 39:01.800
- I understand.

39:03.009 --> 39:05.679
And talking about deja vu,

39:05.679 --> 39:07.514
it's weird to see
the other side of all this.

39:07.514 --> 39:10.225
- It's... gonna work
this time, right?

39:10.225 --> 39:12.644
- If you don't come back up,
I'll know, right?

39:15.188 --> 39:17.023
(deep exhale)

39:26.282 --> 39:28.576
(tense music)

39:38.086 --> 39:40.171
(sighs)

39:46.803 --> 39:48.346
- Hey.

39:49.848 --> 39:51.433
Are you okay?

39:52.892 --> 39:54.602
- I can't do it.

39:58.356 --> 40:02.193
- It's okay. Just... let me.

40:06.031 --> 40:08.908
(soft music)

40:13.038 --> 40:15.206
(sniffling)

40:35.268 --> 40:36.978
(sighs)

41:09.469 --> 41:11.513
- I'm gonna get you!
(laughing)

41:14.099 --> 41:16.309
- Hi, Alice!

41:16.309 --> 41:18.269
- Did you seriously fall
in that pond again?

41:18.269 --> 41:20.772
- Yeah, but I'm fine. I promise.

41:20.772 --> 41:22.982
- Want to stay for dinner?
- Absolutely.

41:22.982 --> 41:24.192
- Okay.
(laughing)

41:26.194 --> 41:27.862
Come on, Jacob!

41:27.862 --> 41:33.201
* Oh I want to fly
away with you *

41:37.288 --> 41:41.835
* Take off right on time *

41:41.835 --> 41:46.506
* We're gonna leave
our troubles behind *

41:46.506 --> 41:51.094
* Wake up under blue skies *

41:51.094 --> 41:54.723
* Cool breeze's
gonna dry your eyes *

41:54.723 --> 42:01.396
* Oh I want to fly
away with you **
