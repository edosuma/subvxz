I did it!

00:13.231 --> 00:15.332
I did what you said!

00:15.368 --> 00:17.099
Do you hear me?

00:17.135 --> 00:21.340
Now please,
leave me alone!

00:23.676 --> 00:25.108
(clears throat)

00:25.144 --> 00:26.643
(glasses clink)

00:26.679 --> 00:28.311
I can't believe
you're here.

00:28.347 --> 00:31.217
I am pretty unbelievable.

00:32.384 --> 00:35.050
I need to apologize.

00:35.086 --> 00:36.720
The last time
we saw each other,

00:36.756 --> 00:38.120
I could have
handled that better.

00:38.156 --> 00:41.190
You're a great guy, but I
already have a great guy.

00:41.226 --> 00:43.660
- You really love him?
- I really do.

00:43.696 --> 00:47.764
It was not my best night,
but I got over it.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.300
It means a lot
that you're here.

00:50.336 --> 00:51.867
Look, I'm sorry
about your daughter.

00:51.903 --> 00:55.839
I know you never met her,
but I just can't imagine

00:55.875 --> 00:59.776
what you must
be feeling right now.

00:59.812 --> 01:02.616
Honestly...

01:03.816 --> 01:05.748
Everything and nothing.

01:05.784 --> 01:08.884
Sometimes, it feels
like I can't breathe,

01:08.920 --> 01:12.789
and then, all of a sudden,
I don't feel anything.

01:12.825 --> 01:17.259
Kurt keeps trying to reach out,
but I look at him,

01:17.295 --> 01:19.898
and all I can see
is what he did.

01:22.435 --> 01:24.200
It was an accident, right?

01:24.236 --> 01:27.270
- Wait, so that's it?
- Yeah. Keeping it from me wasn't.

01:27.306 --> 01:29.104
You're never gonna
talk to him again?

01:29.140 --> 01:31.340
He's not the person
I thought he was.

01:31.376 --> 01:34.744
To keep a lie and then
pretend like it didn't happen,

01:34.780 --> 01:36.915
how am I supposed to
forget that?

01:43.155 --> 01:45.354
I should go.
It's late.

01:45.390 --> 01:48.825
Stay.
I'll sleep on the sofa.

01:48.861 --> 01:50.959
I'll be a good boy,
I promise.

01:50.995 --> 01:52.798
When have you ever
done that?

01:53.498 --> 01:55.398
- Fair point.
- Mm-hmm.

01:55.434 --> 01:57.937
All right.

02:10.815 --> 02:12.849
Here we go.
I made a fresh pot.

02:12.885 --> 02:14.951
Oh, you should leave
more often.

02:14.987 --> 02:16.952
We finally had a breakthrough
while you were gone,

02:16.988 --> 02:18.153
so check this out.

02:18.189 --> 02:19.856
We know
Jane's daughter Avery

02:19.892 --> 02:22.325
and Roman met each other in
a Berlin Hotel six months ago,

02:22.361 --> 02:23.860
but it wasn't
just that one time.

02:23.896 --> 02:26.428
Here they are at the same hotel
three days earlier.

02:26.464 --> 02:27.863
What could they
be meeting about?

02:27.899 --> 02:30.033
- They're planning something.
- And knowing Roman,

02:30.069 --> 02:33.802
it's nothing good.
Do you think Avery's death

02:33.838 --> 02:36.873
was a part of it somehow
to hurt Jane?

02:36.909 --> 02:38.475
(phone alert)

02:38.511 --> 02:39.875
Everything all right?

02:39.911 --> 02:42.979
No, my Wizardville app
keeps glitching.

02:43.015 --> 02:45.147
I've gotten like 500 texts
from my team back in California.

02:45.183 --> 02:46.882
I thought we were your team.

02:46.918 --> 02:48.751
Well, you are, but they
are also my team.

02:48.787 --> 02:50.185
A girl can have more
than one team, Weller.

02:50.221 --> 02:52.355
Patterson.
Right there.

02:52.391 --> 02:54.157
That's Max Kohler.
That's the gangster

02:54.193 --> 02:55.524
that I was chasing down
in Berlin.

02:55.560 --> 02:59.932
The one you thought you shot
when you shot Avery?

03:01.933 --> 03:05.368
She lied to me about Roman,
about knowing Max.

03:05.404 --> 03:06.836
Why do I have a bad feeling
about this?

03:06.872 --> 03:09.071
What else
can you find on Max?

03:09.107 --> 03:11.808
Here we go.
Facial rec found a match.

03:11.844 --> 03:15.545
So it looks like his
real name is Dedrik Hoehne,

03:15.581 --> 03:19.349
rap sheet a mile long,
ties to a German gang.

03:19.385 --> 03:20.916
Basically
a real stand-up guy.

03:20.952 --> 03:23.153
Look, just keep digging.
'Cause if we can find him,

03:23.189 --> 03:26.488
maybe we can find out
what the hell Roman was up to.

03:26.524 --> 03:28.791
(sports fans cheering on TV)

03:28.827 --> 03:31.027
Oh! There we go, baby,
the comeback is on.

03:31.063 --> 03:33.195
Michigan is still down five
and their D is a joke.

03:33.231 --> 03:34.863
First of all, it's halftime.
They'll make adjustments

03:34.899 --> 03:37.534
- and be fine. - Yeah, yeah.
- (phone music)

03:37.570 --> 03:40.469
Hey, how'd you finish
the Undead Ogre Quest?

03:40.505 --> 03:42.205
How did you not?

03:42.241 --> 03:44.407
You bought the Blade
of Zarnac, didn't you?

03:44.443 --> 03:46.308
- That's cheating.
- What?

03:46.344 --> 03:48.310
No blade, no Zarnac.

03:48.346 --> 03:51.046
- Pure Wizardville wizarding skills.
- Unacceptable.

03:51.082 --> 03:53.582
You bought the blade.
That's cheating. You're weak.

03:53.618 --> 03:56.886
Not.
(laughs)

03:56.922 --> 03:59.856
Uh, so when...
When does Meg get back?

03:59.892 --> 04:01.590
She'll be in D.C.
another day.

04:01.626 --> 04:03.058
"The Post" is quoting her
pretty hard ever since

04:03.094 --> 04:04.993
she published that article
on the refugee camp.

04:05.029 --> 04:06.495
I'm telling you,
that girl can write.

04:06.531 --> 04:08.530
- That's great.
- Mm-hmm.

04:08.566 --> 04:11.100
- (phone alert)
- Ah.

04:11.136 --> 04:12.569
Stupid noise.

04:12.605 --> 04:14.369
- Yeah.
- That's been happening to you, too?

04:14.405 --> 04:15.872
Mine shut down
on me twice.

04:15.908 --> 04:16.872
Knocked me back
a whole level.

04:16.908 --> 04:18.040
That's it.
I'm texting Patterson.

04:18.076 --> 04:19.509
Clearly, she's spending
too much time

04:19.545 --> 04:20.576
saving the world
and not enough time

04:20.612 --> 04:21.910
fixing the bugs in this game.

04:21.946 --> 04:25.047
(cell phone vibrating)

04:25.083 --> 04:27.050
Hey, Meg, how's DC?

04:27.086 --> 04:28.884
Really?

04:28.920 --> 04:30.987
Oh, wow, they did what?

04:31.023 --> 04:32.592
Wait, what was
the guy doing?

04:34.025 --> 04:37.360
Not only do I have Pop-Tarts
and real coffee now...

04:37.396 --> 04:38.862
- no offense to yours...
- Yeah.

04:38.898 --> 04:42.432
I just found a major lead
on that Dedrik guy.

04:42.468 --> 04:47.069
So, he lives in a farm
outside Berlin

04:47.105 --> 04:50.906
in a town called Spandau.
There was a 9-1-1 call...

04:50.942 --> 04:52.941
Well, technically, 1-1-2,
because it's Germany,

04:52.977 --> 04:55.912
but it was traced
to an address

04:55.948 --> 04:58.146
right next door
to Dedrik's property.

04:58.182 --> 04:59.648
(woman)
<i>Please help.</i>

04:59.684 --> 05:01.083

hills.</i>

05:07.091 --> 05:08.458
<i>Please send someone.
My name...</i>

05:08.494 --> 05:10.326
- (dial tone)
- That's Avery.

05:10.362 --> 05:12.394
What?
Are you sure?

05:12.430 --> 05:13.663
I'm sure.

05:13.699 --> 05:15.131
Why would she be
working with Dedrik

05:15.167 --> 05:16.232
after he kidnapped her?

05:16.268 --> 05:17.499
Hang on a second.

05:17.535 --> 05:20.038
Look at the timestamp
on this call.

05:20.706 --> 05:24.576
Hey.
Everything okay?

05:25.944 --> 05:28.977
We just found a recording
of your daughter in Germany,

05:29.013 --> 05:30.884
calling for help.

05:33.549 --> 05:34.951
What are you doing?

05:34.987 --> 05:36.619
Avery is dead, Kurt.

05:36.655 --> 05:37.519
There's nothing
we can do about it

05:37.555 --> 05:39.122
and I can't keep
listening to details...

05:39.158 --> 05:42.691
Jane, that call
was from four days ago,

05:42.727 --> 05:45.932
so your daughter
is still alive.

It's just... It doesn't
make any sense.

06:00.739 --> 06:01.970
The timestamp on the call
has to be wrong.

06:02.006 --> 06:03.872
How can Avery be alive
when you said

06:03.908 --> 06:05.844
you watched her die
with your own eyes?

06:08.013 --> 06:10.312
I thought that I did.
She was covered in blood,

06:10.348 --> 06:12.715
dilated pupils,
no pulse.

06:12.751 --> 06:15.050
Now we have her on tape,
three days earlier,

06:15.086 --> 06:17.752
planning something
with Roman and Dedrik.

06:17.788 --> 06:19.355
You think it's a setup?

06:19.391 --> 06:22.591
You think Roman got Avery
to fake her own death?

06:22.627 --> 06:24.563
He got us to fake yours.

06:28.966 --> 06:31.300
The blood could have
been fake, too.

06:31.336 --> 06:33.235
If they injected her with the same
drug to slow her heart rate...

06:33.271 --> 06:35.203
This was just another plan
to tear us apart.

06:35.239 --> 06:38.941
Roman wanted us to think
that you killed my daughter.

06:38.977 --> 06:41.309
And I played right
into his hands.

06:41.345 --> 06:44.246
And now you're telling me
some German criminal

06:44.282 --> 06:47.617
has been holding her captive
for God knows how...

06:47.653 --> 06:50.686
Her call for help
came four days ago, Kurt.

06:50.722 --> 06:53.889
And just because she was
alive then doesn't mean...

06:53.925 --> 06:55.857
If you had just told me
sooner...

06:55.893 --> 07:00.896
If I could take back everything
that I did, I would.

07:00.932 --> 07:05.104
Now we have a second chance
to make things right.

07:07.439 --> 07:09.271
With all this intel
suggesting Jane's daughter

07:09.307 --> 07:11.073
might still be alive,
our task now

07:11.109 --> 07:13.109
is to find her
as quickly as possible.

07:13.145 --> 07:16.177
If Avery was working with
Roman and Dedrik willingly,

07:16.213 --> 07:17.980
then why would they need
to kidnap her after?

07:18.016 --> 07:20.749
We don't know.
Maybe she changed her mind.

07:20.785 --> 07:22.884
Maybe Roman didn't trust
that she'd stay out of view

07:22.920 --> 07:24.787
and preserve the story
of her death,

07:24.823 --> 07:26.655
or he needs her
for something else.

07:26.691 --> 07:28.824
(Zapata) I hate to even suggest
this, but how do we know

07:28.860 --> 07:29.992
this girl's even
Jane's daughter

07:30.028 --> 07:31.761
and not just another one
of Roman's traps?

07:31.797 --> 07:32.961
Her identity checks out.

07:32.997 --> 07:35.230
I tracked down the nurse
at the hospital

07:35.266 --> 07:36.398
where Jane gave birth.

07:36.434 --> 07:37.900
And she gave us the name

07:37.936 --> 07:41.002
of Avery's adoptive parents,
Bob and Elsa Drabkin.

07:41.038 --> 07:42.737
From there, Patterson
dug up school records

07:42.773 --> 07:44.105
and family photos.

07:44.141 --> 07:46.675
The photos match the girl
I met in Berlin.

07:46.711 --> 07:47.843
It is definitely her.

07:47.879 --> 07:50.812
(Reade) Avery's 9-1-1
call was cut short.

07:50.848 --> 07:51.646
Maybe her captors
walked in on her

07:51.682 --> 07:53.381
while she was trying
to call for help.

07:53.417 --> 07:56.418
Meaning if she is still alive,
we may not have much time.

07:56.454 --> 07:58.987
- I'll send a local team to Dedrik's farm again.
- No.

07:59.023 --> 08:00.422
We only have one shot
to get this right.

08:00.458 --> 08:02.258
I'm not trusting anyone
I don't know.

08:02.294 --> 08:04.960
Jane's right. We've got
to be smart about this.

08:04.996 --> 08:06.761
If Roman learns that
we've all left the country,

08:06.797 --> 08:08.698
then he'll move her and make
sure that we never find her.

08:08.734 --> 08:09.999
And the team has to be small.

08:10.035 --> 08:11.766
All right,
you run point with Jane.

08:11.802 --> 08:13.468
You're familiar with Dedrik
and you can ID Avery.

08:13.504 --> 08:15.170
This is my daughter, okay?

08:15.206 --> 08:18.209
I'm running this,
and I don't want Kurt there.

08:19.211 --> 08:21.744
Jane, you can't do this alone.

08:21.780 --> 08:22.877
There's someone else
I want to bring.

08:22.913 --> 08:24.713
His name is Clem Hahn.

08:24.749 --> 08:26.982
He's one of the best kidnap
and ransom guys out there.

08:27.018 --> 08:29.317
I can't authorize a civilian,
let alone a stranger.

08:29.353 --> 08:31.387
He's a professional
and this is what he does.

08:31.423 --> 08:32.988
He's not a stranger.

08:33.024 --> 08:35.857
We have worked over a dozen jobs
together, all successful.

08:35.894 --> 08:36.859
It's too risky.

08:36.895 --> 08:38.860
Look, you can help me
or you can jam me up,

08:38.895 --> 08:39.961
but I am doing this
my way,

08:39.996 --> 08:42.898
with or without
the FBI's help.

08:42.933 --> 08:44.799
It wouldn't hurt to have an
expert with people in Berlin.

08:44.835 --> 08:49.374
I'll vet Clem and if he passes,
he goes with Jane and Weller.

08:59.251 --> 09:02.451
- Rich.
- Hey, all-beef Patty. Have you read this book?

09:02.487 --> 09:04.153
It's fantastic. I'm almost
done with page one.

09:04.189 --> 09:07.089
Wonderful. Something
is happening with my app.

09:07.125 --> 09:10.493
It keeps glitching and
thousands of users are affected.

09:10.529 --> 09:12.094
Don't you have an army
of overpaid millennials

09:12.130 --> 09:14.930
- to figure that out?
- The millennials are trying,

09:14.966 --> 09:16.164
but that's not
why I'm worried.

09:16.200 --> 09:20.769
The glitch is in
the sandboxing admin.

09:20.805 --> 09:22.538
That's where your little
backdoor exploit lives.

09:22.574 --> 09:24.773
What if someone's hacked it?

09:24.809 --> 09:26.408
Well, that would be
very bad for you.

09:26.444 --> 09:27.842
For the world.

09:27.878 --> 09:30.178
A hacker using an FBI
agent's video game app

09:30.214 --> 09:32.815
to crack people's phones,
accessing potentially

09:32.851 --> 09:34.082
millions of users'
credit card numbers,

09:34.118 --> 09:36.085
personal information,
compromising photos.

09:36.121 --> 09:38.486
- Okay!
- I'm just saying, if it got out that you had

09:38.522 --> 09:40.789
an illegal backdoor on your
app that you knew about?

09:40.825 --> 09:42.924
- This isn't making me feel any better.
- Oh, no?

09:42.960 --> 09:44.893
Is that my job here,
to make you feel better?

09:44.929 --> 09:46.528
Or do you want me
to help you fix this?

09:46.564 --> 09:48.964
The second one, obviously.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.369
Okay, let's go.

09:55.140 --> 09:56.938
So were you in a relationship
with this guy?

09:56.974 --> 09:58.874
You and I were apart.

09:58.910 --> 10:00.975
I didn't think we could
see each other ever again.

10:01.011 --> 10:02.812
Were you ever gonna tell me?

10:02.848 --> 10:05.547
You really want to play
that card with me?

10:05.583 --> 10:07.850
Look, it was over.

10:07.886 --> 10:10.085
I was trying not to hurt you.

10:10.121 --> 10:11.986
You know, maybe we should
just stop working so hard

10:12.022 --> 10:13.956
to protect each other,
because it just

10:13.992 --> 10:15.924
seems to make things worse.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.259
(door opens)

10:17.295 --> 10:19.165
Jane.

10:21.399 --> 10:23.566
Hey. Clem.

10:23.602 --> 10:25.835
Kurt.

10:25.871 --> 10:28.340
Ah.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.472
All right,
so is this gonna be...?

10:31.508 --> 10:34.310
Jane says that you're good.
So what have you got?

10:34.346 --> 10:37.479
I, uh, talked to my guys
on the ground.

10:37.515 --> 10:39.447
Had them check out
that farm in Spandau.

10:39.483 --> 10:40.883
It's abandoned.

10:40.919 --> 10:41.884
So we're at a dead end.

10:41.920 --> 10:42.717
No, not exactly.

10:42.753 --> 10:45.019
My contact said
that Dedrik's crew

10:45.055 --> 10:47.288
uses a factory in
Berlin as a front.

10:47.324 --> 10:48.990
You think that's
where they moved Avery?

10:49.026 --> 10:50.459
Well, there have been
a lot of cars

10:50.495 --> 10:52.027
coming in and out recently,
so it's a good bet.

10:52.063 --> 10:53.665
Fine.
We start there.

10:57.535 --> 10:58.868
Hey, what's so urgent?

10:58.904 --> 11:03.205
There's a bunch of
strange YouTube videos

11:03.241 --> 11:07.045
and I'm pretty sure that
they're related to my app.

11:09.179 --> 11:10.980
(car horns honking)

11:11.016 --> 11:13.047
Sadly, not the first time
I've seen that in New York.

11:13.083 --> 11:16.885
Then there's this woman upstate
who set fire to a grocery store

11:16.921 --> 11:19.120
wearing a bunny suit,
injuring 12 people.

11:19.156 --> 11:22.124
And this guy in Detroit
who robbed a bank

11:22.160 --> 11:23.491
wearing only a diaper.

11:23.527 --> 11:25.127
In each case,
these people seem to be

11:25.163 --> 11:27.462
pleading with somebody
off screen to leave them alone.

11:27.498 --> 11:28.297
So it's extortion.

11:28.333 --> 11:30.965
And this relates
to Wizardville how?

11:31.001 --> 11:32.967
These people
are all subscribers.

11:33.003 --> 11:35.236
Well, you have 75 million users.
It could be a coincidence.

11:35.272 --> 11:38.239
Well, over 80 now,
but I don't think it is.

11:38.275 --> 11:41.243
I probably should have
told you this sooner.

11:41.279 --> 11:43.345
Or never. I still think
that's a viable option.

11:43.381 --> 11:46.447
The accidental
byproducts of my coding

11:46.483 --> 11:50.085
gave me full access
to my subscribers' phones.

11:50.121 --> 11:53.321
- I... I looked into the accounts
- Say that again.

11:53.357 --> 11:56.090
for everyone in these videos,
and I found evidence

11:56.126 --> 11:56.825
of an external breach.

11:56.861 --> 11:58.027
Of a breach
you already created.

11:58.063 --> 11:59.427
By accident, yes.

11:59.463 --> 12:00.930
Although if I could
just say, when you sign

12:00.966 --> 12:02.331
the user agreement,
you're technically

12:02.367 --> 12:04.166
acknowledging this is
a possibility, right?

12:04.202 --> 12:06.668
- I mean, no one really reads the fine print...
- Not helping, Rich.

12:06.704 --> 12:08.704
So you're saying someone's
using this backdoor

12:08.740 --> 12:09.938
to blackmail people.
Who?

12:09.974 --> 12:11.407
We don't know that yet,

12:11.443 --> 12:13.042
but it's been happening
for a while.

12:13.078 --> 12:14.677
So, as long as Wizardville
is still active,

12:14.713 --> 12:16.946
this hacker will
continue to have access

12:16.982 --> 12:17.946
to personal information.

12:17.982 --> 12:19.214
So shut it down.

12:19.250 --> 12:21.316
It's over 80 million
active users. I...

12:21.352 --> 12:22.417
Okay.

12:22.453 --> 12:24.219
Thank you.
We can talk about

12:24.255 --> 12:26.458
this massive breach
of trust later.

12:30.996 --> 12:33.729
Hey.
I got something here.

12:33.765 --> 12:36.401
Factory blueprints.

12:39.103 --> 12:41.437
All right,
so there's three entrances.

12:41.473 --> 12:44.139
We each take a door,
going hard and fast,

12:44.175 --> 12:45.606
and surround them
from all sides.

12:45.642 --> 12:47.275
We should...

12:47.311 --> 12:49.211
We should go in quietly,
together.

12:49.247 --> 12:50.512
We split up
once we're inside.

12:50.548 --> 12:52.380
The more time that they
have to see us coming,

12:52.416 --> 12:54.649
then the more time
they have to hurt Avery.

12:54.685 --> 12:56.150
We use shock and awe,

12:56.186 --> 12:57.619
and Avery could get hurt
because of it.

12:57.655 --> 13:00.121
Okay, we don't know
what we're walking into.

13:00.157 --> 13:02.023
The place could be rigged.

13:02.059 --> 13:03.292
So I say
we go with Clem's way.

13:03.328 --> 13:05.226
We stay together,
take 'em by surprise.

13:05.262 --> 13:07.062
That's how we did
most of our K&R runs.

13:07.098 --> 13:11.569
Fine. So then
we go in slow and quietly.

13:14.671 --> 13:16.404
That was Weller. They're
on the ground in Berlin.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.142
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't do this to me.

13:18.178 --> 13:19.307
Hey, hey, is everything
okay over there?

13:19.343 --> 13:21.042
Opposite, opposite,
opposite.

13:21.078 --> 13:22.311
What's wrong?

13:22.347 --> 13:24.046
They turned my app back on.

13:24.082 --> 13:25.346
Well, then turn it back off
before Reade finds out.

13:25.382 --> 13:26.782
That man is one piece
of bad news away

13:26.818 --> 13:28.484
from committing a serious
workplace accident.

13:28.520 --> 13:30.152
I... I can't.
They locked me out.

13:30.188 --> 13:32.020
Give me this.

13:32.056 --> 13:33.654
They took away
your admin privileges.

13:33.690 --> 13:35.023
I just lost control
of Wizardville,

13:35.059 --> 13:36.424
and the backdoor
is wide open.

13:36.460 --> 13:38.560
Which means the hackers
can do whatever they want

13:38.596 --> 13:40.199
to 80 million targets.

13:48.238 --> 13:49.507
Jane!

13:55.413 --> 13:57.549
We've got to stop him.

14:19.103 --> 14:20.472
(metal clanks)

14:21.839 --> 14:23.508
(gunshots)

14:24.409 --> 14:25.374
Now they know we're here.

14:25.410 --> 14:26.712
We need to move fast.

14:31.716 --> 14:33.081
Jane!

14:33.117 --> 14:34.383
You okay?

14:34.419 --> 14:35.417
We have one hostile down
on the east wing.

14:35.453 --> 14:37.252
- Any sign of Avery?
- Nothing.

14:37.288 --> 14:39.120
All right, let's clear
the north end of the building.

14:39.156 --> 14:42.191
(explosion)

14:42.227 --> 14:43.429
Avery!

14:50.300 --> 14:51.402
Avery!

14:52.636 --> 14:53.771
(muffled cries)

14:55.240 --> 14:58.444
(tires squealing
and horn beeping)

15:05.803 --> 15:08.232
The van didn't have plates,
but we can give a description.

15:08.268 --> 15:10.055
Okay, I'll call the police
and put out an Amber Alert.

15:10.091 --> 15:12.496
We should have breached this
building from different sides.

15:12.532 --> 15:13.296
It wouldn't have mattered.

15:13.332 --> 15:14.999
They made an exit
that wasn't on the map.

15:15.035 --> 15:16.495
And besides, if you
didn't shoot the guy,

15:16.531 --> 15:18.364
we would have somebody
to talk to still.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.666
If I didn't shoot
that guy, you'd be dead.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.737
(Jane)
Guys, guys!

15:23.804 --> 15:25.037
This guy you shot
has a phone.

15:25.073 --> 15:26.639
He's got to have
Dedrik's number.

15:26.675 --> 15:28.139
Well, we can't call him
without a plan.

15:28.175 --> 15:29.707
You got a better idea?

15:29.743 --> 15:31.009
Let me see if
I can crack his password.

15:31.045 --> 15:33.044
How you gonna do that?
Trial and error?

15:33.080 --> 15:34.682
Give me the phone.

15:43.925 --> 15:45.858
- Cracked.
- Nicely done.

15:45.894 --> 15:48.192
Okay, the German phone network
is heavily encrypted.

15:48.228 --> 15:49.794
It's gonna be hard
to trace the call.

15:49.830 --> 15:50.995
I got a program
that might work.

15:51.031 --> 15:52.031
I used it on a job
in Belgium.

15:52.067 --> 15:53.032
It's a similar system.

15:53.068 --> 15:54.832
I'll call international ops

15:54.868 --> 15:55.670
and get us a safe house.

15:57.072 --> 15:58.674
Come on.

16:03.243 --> 16:05.711
Any luck finding the hacker
or unlocking the app?

16:05.747 --> 16:06.711
Not especially.

16:06.747 --> 16:10.048
We talked to Weller.
Dedrik got away with Avery.

16:10.084 --> 16:11.816
Poor Jane.

16:11.852 --> 16:15.657
Dealing with her daughter
and everything with Weller.

16:16.991 --> 16:18.691
What's wrong?

16:18.727 --> 16:21.826
Reade and I hung out
last night.

16:21.862 --> 16:24.229
Please tell me you guys
didn't make out,

16:24.265 --> 16:25.230
because I really like Meg.

16:25.266 --> 16:26.731
No, of course not.

16:26.767 --> 16:29.802
I like her, too. I...

16:29.838 --> 16:31.003
I would never.

16:31.039 --> 16:35.177
We just had so much fun,
like old times.

16:38.378 --> 16:40.913
What if he feels
the same way?

16:40.949 --> 16:42.880
Shouldn't I just
tell him now?

16:42.916 --> 16:46.951
If you do, you have to be
prepared for whatever he may...

16:46.987 --> 16:50.254
I tell you, the hand soap in
the bathrooms is so luxurious.

16:50.290 --> 16:51.489
Were you guys
just talking about me?

16:51.525 --> 16:53.892
No, we are never
talking about you.

16:53.928 --> 16:56.699
Oh, wait.
That's weird.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.232
(Patterson)
What?

17:00.268 --> 17:03.101
Well, it's just a marker
Boston used to use

17:03.137 --> 17:04.102
in his hacking code
as a signature,

17:04.137 --> 17:07.039
but that can't be him.

17:07.075 --> 17:08.741
Boston, like,
your ex-boyfriend?

17:08.777 --> 17:11.776
No, like a different guy
named Boston.

17:11.811 --> 17:13.344
What is that look?

17:13.380 --> 17:17.849
Boston was one of my
initial Wizardville coders.

17:17.886 --> 17:18.849
- What?
- What?

17:18.886 --> 17:20.752
I had a team of MIT grads

17:20.789 --> 17:22.753
working on it,
but I just needed

17:22.790 --> 17:24.021
someone with more skill.

17:24.058 --> 17:25.056
So you called him
and not me?

17:25.092 --> 17:26.125
I... I needed someone

17:26.161 --> 17:27.859
who could work with my team,

17:27.896 --> 17:30.763
and despite the fact that
he was super rude to me

17:30.799 --> 17:33.365
and not to mention
a known criminal,

17:33.401 --> 17:35.067
we kind of bonded
during that Daedalus mission

17:35.103 --> 17:37.936
a couple years ago and I know
he's a super amazing coder,

17:37.972 --> 17:41.106
- so I hired him.
- (Zapata) So Boston found the backdoor

17:41.142 --> 17:44.909
or he built it, and now he's
using it to blackmail people.

17:44.945 --> 17:46.378
No, he wouldn't do that.
Boston's been

17:46.414 --> 17:48.781
on the wrong side of the law,
but he's a thief, okay?

17:48.817 --> 17:50.282
He's never been about
hurting people, ever.

17:50.318 --> 17:51.949
Believe me, I've asked.
He's not into it.

17:51.985 --> 17:55.020
- (Zapata) When's the last time you saw him?
- Well...

17:55.056 --> 17:57.488
- People change.
- (Patterson) We need to find him and stop him.

17:57.524 --> 17:58.490
People have already
gotten hurt, and it's only

17:58.526 --> 18:02.060
a matter of time before
someone gets killed.

18:02.096 --> 18:04.929
(Clem) All set. When we make
the call, we should be able

18:04.965 --> 18:06.965
to pick up Dedrik's signal
within seconds.

18:07.001 --> 18:08.833
After that, it all
depends on the cell towers

18:08.869 --> 18:09.802
and how fast we can
pinpoint a location.

18:09.838 --> 18:13.341
Okay. I'll talk.
'cause he knows me already.

18:14.209 --> 18:15.974
(beeps)

18:16.010 --> 18:17.074
(Dedrik)
<i>Hello?</i>

18:17.110 --> 18:19.343
Dedrik, this is Kurt Weller.

18:19.379 --> 18:20.344
Wie geht's, <i>Kurt.</i>

18:20.380 --> 18:22.281
Dedrik, listen to me.

18:22.317 --> 18:23.581
<i>All we want is Avery.</i>

18:23.617 --> 18:26.918
All I want is a way out.
Lift the Amber Alert

18:26.954 --> 18:29.454
<i>and get me an unmarked jet
at the Schonefeld Airport.</i>

18:29.490 --> 18:31.456
<i>You have until 3:00
or I kill her.</i>

18:31.492 --> 18:33.825
How can I trust you?
You've already set me up,

18:33.861 --> 18:34.960
made me think
that I killed Avery.

18:34.996 --> 18:37.462
<i>Yeah, when you thought
you were shooting me.</i>

18:37.498 --> 18:38.930
I wish I could have
seen your face

18:38.966 --> 18:40.599
when you saw her lying there.

18:40.635 --> 18:42.367
She's a good little actress.

18:42.403 --> 18:44.168
We won't meet
any of your demands

18:44.204 --> 18:45.870
unless you prove Avery
is still alive.

18:45.906 --> 18:49.444
Very well.
See for yourself.

18:52.312 --> 18:56.048
<i>See?
Very much alive.</i>

18:56.084 --> 18:57.381
- <i>For now.</i>
- Avery!

18:57.417 --> 18:59.217
No, let me talk to her.

18:59.253 --> 19:01.152
<i>You have your proof.</i>

19:01.188 --> 19:06.358
<i>Now get me my way out,
and don't do anything stupid.</i>

19:06.394 --> 19:07.458
(whispering)

19:07.494 --> 19:12.129
I was only able to narrow it
down to a mile radius.

19:12.165 --> 19:13.501
It's a start.

19:15.936 --> 19:18.236
You hire a known criminal
to code your app

19:18.272 --> 19:19.571
and you're
surprised he hacked you?

19:19.607 --> 19:20.539
I mean, not to make this
all about me,

19:20.575 --> 19:22.975
but not every criminal
is a bad guy, right?

19:23.011 --> 19:24.309
We've narrowed down
his whereabouts

19:24.345 --> 19:26.043
to three possible locations...

19:26.079 --> 19:27.879
Rome, Bali, and Tasmania.

19:27.915 --> 19:29.014
You wanna go ahead
and take Rome off that list.

19:29.050 --> 19:30.983
He would never go there
without me.

19:31.019 --> 19:33.051
I wouldn't underestimate him. He's
an elusive world class con man.

19:33.087 --> 19:35.553
He also makes an excellent
pappardelle... fun fact.

19:35.589 --> 19:37.421
Patterson, contact Interpol
and the local authorities.

19:37.457 --> 19:39.358
Zapata, talk to all
your friends at the CIA.

19:39.394 --> 19:41.493
Do something to find
this guy, please.

19:41.529 --> 19:44.263
Good luck. We're talking
about one of the finest conmen

19:44.299 --> 19:45.964
and hackers
this world has ever known.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.532
He speaks seven languages.

19:47.568 --> 19:49.001
He has contacts
all over the world.

19:49.037 --> 19:50.034
If he doesn't
want to be found,

19:50.070 --> 19:51.035
you're not gonna find him.

19:51.071 --> 19:54.406
Uh, we might not have to.

19:54.442 --> 19:57.242
Guess who just checked in
with security.

19:57.278 --> 19:58.910
(elevator bell dings)

19:58.946 --> 20:01.282
So, we should talk.

20:06.673 --> 20:09.658
I know you've been hacking
people's phones through my app.

20:09.694 --> 20:12.360
It was my boyfriend's idea.

20:12.396 --> 20:16.097
I'm sorry, boyfriend?
Uh, who is your boyfriend?

20:16.133 --> 20:19.033
Not that it's any of your
business, but it's Sanjay.

20:19.069 --> 20:20.968
Sanjay Bonthala?

20:21.004 --> 20:23.638
Mr. Nicest Guy in the World,
Bollywood good looks,

20:23.674 --> 20:25.340
blinding smile
you can see from space?

20:25.376 --> 20:26.507
Yeah, he sounds horrible.

20:26.543 --> 20:28.109
He is horrible.
It's all an act.

20:28.145 --> 20:31.012
He's a lowlife, darkweb
trolling, womanizing,

20:31.048 --> 20:33.113
manizing
pathological scumbag

20:33.149 --> 20:34.683
that'll do anything
to make a buck!

20:34.719 --> 20:36.952
I have a type.

20:36.988 --> 20:39.187
So, you decided to
shut me out of my app

20:39.223 --> 20:41.156
and use it
to blackmail people?

20:41.192 --> 20:43.158
At first, it was...
it was just voyeurism.

20:43.194 --> 20:44.959
Sifting through
people's lives.

20:44.995 --> 20:48.996
But some of the things
we found really pissed me off.

20:49.032 --> 20:51.533
The naked guy on YouTube
who went viral?

20:51.569 --> 20:54.168
He was stealing from
a kid's cancer charity

20:54.204 --> 20:58.572
to go on Alaskan cruises,
so we made him pay.

20:58.608 --> 21:00.675
It was basically
a public service.

21:00.711 --> 21:02.476
If you were doing such good
deeds, then why come in?

21:02.512 --> 21:05.080
This morning over breakfast,
I realized that Sanjay

21:05.116 --> 21:07.014
has been hacking
the app on his own.

21:07.050 --> 21:09.283
Breakfast?
Do you live together?

21:09.319 --> 21:11.585
Do you make him toast soldiers
with the dippy eggs?

21:11.621 --> 21:15.657
I overheard him talking about
some deal going down today.

21:15.693 --> 21:17.324
He said he had someone
by the balls.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.094
- Any idea who?
- I went through his browser history

21:20.130 --> 21:20.862
and the last person
he accessed

21:20.898 --> 21:22.530
was someone named
Johnny Sheridan.

21:22.566 --> 21:24.232
Why do you think this hack
is any different?

21:24.268 --> 21:25.699
Sanjay never gets nervous,

21:25.735 --> 21:28.369
but he's been acting
strange all week,

21:28.405 --> 21:31.071
and why is he keeping
this hack from me?

21:31.107 --> 21:34.542
Something is going on
and it isn't good.

21:34.578 --> 21:36.543
Okay, Patterson, look into Sheridan.
We keep tabs on Sanjay.

21:36.579 --> 21:37.946
Be careful not to alert him.
We need him to think

21:37.982 --> 21:41.519
it's still business as usual if we're
gonna find out what he's after.

21:45.121 --> 21:48.089
Do you...
do our thing with him?

21:48.125 --> 21:49.056
Yes.

21:49.092 --> 21:51.128
Out, now!

21:53.063 --> 21:55.662
(Clem) This is an
approximate radius.

21:55.698 --> 21:57.131
(Weller) It looked like
Avery was in a basement.

21:57.167 --> 21:59.767
Concrete floors.
No natural light.

21:59.803 --> 22:01.269
I heard a rumble
in the background...

22:01.305 --> 22:03.037
maybe a train
or a subway nearby.

22:03.073 --> 22:04.671
I'll see what runs
around there.

22:04.707 --> 22:06.210
Wait.

22:07.578 --> 22:09.543
Look at this.
She's signaling.

22:09.579 --> 22:11.178
Watch her fingers.
She holds up two...

22:11.214 --> 22:13.281
and then three.

22:13.317 --> 22:14.748
(Clem)
An address?

22:14.784 --> 22:16.117
Uh...

22:16.153 --> 22:18.686
What about this?
Tunnel 23.

22:18.722 --> 22:20.354
I mean, it's within
that radius,

22:20.390 --> 22:22.122
and the S-Bahn train
runs right next to it.

22:22.158 --> 22:24.559
- Tunnel 23.
- (Clem) It's an underground tunnel system

22:24.595 --> 22:26.460
that the east Berliners dug.
They used it to escape

22:26.496 --> 22:29.063
to the west back in the '60s
when the wall went up.

22:29.099 --> 22:30.465
Closed to the public
in 2012.

22:30.501 --> 22:32.332
They were waiting for
funding to make the museum.

22:32.368 --> 22:36.137
So it's empty. It's
a great place to hide out.

22:36.173 --> 22:39.107
So I dug into the guy Sanjay's
targeting, Johnny Sheridan.

22:39.143 --> 22:42.342
He's a top engineer
at Gilroy Industries,

22:42.378 --> 22:44.712
- mega defense contractor.
- We did some forensic math,

22:44.748 --> 22:48.183
and he's been playing kind of
fast and loose with the books.

22:48.219 --> 22:50.819
Yeah, over the last ten years,
he's embezzled millions.

22:50.855 --> 22:52.486
If Sanjay figured out
he could blackmail this guy,

22:52.522 --> 22:53.754
- (Patterson) Besides money,
- what is he after?

22:53.790 --> 22:58.158
Sheridan has the highest level
security clearance at Gilroy,

22:58.194 --> 23:01.495
so he can get his hands on
all kinds of heavy artillery.

23:01.531 --> 23:04.698
RPGs. Surface-to-air
missiles, cluster bombs.

23:04.734 --> 23:06.367
The markup's pretty high
on the black market.

23:06.403 --> 23:07.769
Sanjay's pretty dialed in
on the darkweb.

23:07.805 --> 23:09.270
I mean, not to the point
that I was,

23:09.306 --> 23:11.171
but he could make a sale
like this, no problem.

23:11.207 --> 23:13.207
Send teams to get Sheridan now
and alert border authorities

23:13.243 --> 23:14.712
in case he tries to flip.

23:21.417 --> 23:23.318
How you holding up?

23:23.354 --> 23:25.186
I need to see her in person.
I need to hear her voice.

23:25.222 --> 23:27.187
You're going to.

23:27.223 --> 23:29.224
(sighs)

23:29.260 --> 23:30.725
Thanks for doing this.

23:30.761 --> 23:32.392
I'm glad I'm here.

23:32.428 --> 23:34.195
If I'm honest,
after you left,

23:34.231 --> 23:38.198
I was holding out hope
that you might come back.

23:38.234 --> 23:40.767
Maybe a part of me still is.

23:40.803 --> 23:41.872
(door opens)

23:42.940 --> 23:45.477
Car's ready.
Let's move.

23:48.444 --> 23:50.645
You mind letting me know
what this is all about?

23:50.681 --> 23:52.412
I just got dragged
off the ninth tee

23:52.448 --> 23:55.149
by a bunch of men in black
wearing ear pieces, okay?

23:55.185 --> 23:57.284
And it's just not... You know, it's
just not a good look at the club.

23:57.320 --> 23:59.187
Mr. Sheridan, we know
you're being blackmailed

23:59.223 --> 24:00.487
by a man named
Sanjay Bonthala.

24:00.523 --> 24:03.658
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

24:03.694 --> 24:06.226
What does Sanjay
want access to?

24:06.262 --> 24:08.329
You have the wrong guy.
I don't... I don't know

24:08.365 --> 24:11.331
a Sanjay Bon-whatever.
Nobody's blackmailing me.

24:11.367 --> 24:13.234
You're a pretty easy target.

24:13.270 --> 24:15.335
You've been padding your
offshore accounts for years.

24:15.371 --> 24:16.803
Those accounts aren't mine.

24:16.839 --> 24:18.673
And these aren't
your phone records?

24:18.709 --> 24:22.243
Looks like Mr. Bon-whatever's
been calling you a lot lately.

24:22.279 --> 24:24.244
This is a witch hunt.
You let me go.

24:24.280 --> 24:26.246
Right now, or I'm gonna
get my lawyer

24:26.282 --> 24:29.184
and he's gonna make sure that
you both burn at the stake.

24:29.220 --> 24:30.885
One phone call
to my buddies at the IRS

24:30.921 --> 24:32.486
and they give you
a visit today.

24:32.522 --> 24:34.755
Goodbye vacation home
in Turks and Caicos,

24:34.791 --> 24:37.358
goodbye cheesy yacht.
Goodbye natural light.

24:37.394 --> 24:40.727
(Reade) Or you can talk to us
and we can work something out.

24:40.763 --> 24:44.431
I was the victim here, okay?
Sanjay threatened me.

24:44.467 --> 24:45.766
For what?
What did he want?

24:45.802 --> 24:49.704
- White phosphorus bombs.
- When's the handoff?

24:49.740 --> 24:51.706
It was this morning.
It already happened.

24:51.742 --> 24:53.574
He picked them up from me
at a warehouse in Yonkers.

24:53.610 --> 24:55.812
(Zapata) You may want to
call that lawyer now.

24:57.982 --> 25:01.748
(Patterson) White phosphorus bombs...
hotter than napalm.

25:01.784 --> 25:04.284
Known for searing victims
to the bone.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.286
Also extremely
difficult to extinguish.

25:06.322 --> 25:08.289
And Sanjay
got his hands on 12.

25:08.325 --> 25:11.458
Who sells illegal arms behind
their loved ones' backs?

25:11.494 --> 25:13.927
- You. You did that constantly.
- It's... it's...

25:13.963 --> 25:16.496
We sent a team
to the warehouse in Yonkers.

25:16.532 --> 25:18.733
They didn't find
the bombs or Sanjay.

25:18.769 --> 25:20.235
Any idea
who the buyers are?

25:20.271 --> 25:22.236
According to my CIA contacts,
the Dabbur Zann

25:22.272 --> 25:24.606
has been using this kind
of bombing attacks overseas.

25:24.642 --> 25:26.241
It's become
their weapon of choice.

25:26.277 --> 25:29.244
I looked into
known associates in the U.S.

25:29.280 --> 25:31.646
Collin Burke
and Teren Jablecki.

25:31.682 --> 25:34.849
Facial rec found them on CC
cameras last night in Manhattan.

25:34.885 --> 25:38.253
T.J. Sanjay mentioned a T.J.
on the phone this morning.

25:38.289 --> 25:39.786
- That must be him.
- (Reade) The Dabbur Zann isn't known

25:39.822 --> 25:41.321
for sitting on their hands.

25:41.357 --> 25:42.657
If they're the ones
buying these bombs,

25:42.693 --> 25:43.725
we have to assume
an attack is imminent

25:43.761 --> 25:44.993
and we have to stop it today.

25:45.029 --> 25:48.263
I know how we do it.
Send me in with a wire.

25:48.299 --> 25:50.697
I'll get Sanjay
to take me to the sale,

25:50.733 --> 25:52.966
and when I get a visual on
the bad guys and the bombs,

25:53.002 --> 25:55.637
you raid
and make the arrests.

25:55.673 --> 25:59.006
Eyes on the inside
takes out the guesswork.

25:59.042 --> 26:00.375
I don't hate it.

26:00.411 --> 26:04.379
- Are you sure you're up for this?
- No.

26:04.415 --> 26:06.714
But I can't let Sanjay
sell those bombs.

26:06.750 --> 26:09.317
I'm a lot of things,
but I'm not a murderer.

26:09.353 --> 26:11.256
See?

26:13.523 --> 26:15.889
Hey, hon, sorry I'm late.

26:15.925 --> 26:19.394
I couldn't find those little
wafer cookies I like anywhere.

26:19.430 --> 26:20.628
What's going on?

26:20.664 --> 26:22.664
You seem a little tense.

26:22.700 --> 26:24.564
What?
I don't get tense.

26:24.600 --> 26:27.302
I seem tense?
No, it's nothing.

26:27.338 --> 26:30.504
Work stuff.
Oh, look at you.

26:30.540 --> 26:33.474
I'm the worst boyfriend,
giving you all my bad energy.

26:33.510 --> 26:36.047
Here, hold my hands.

26:38.382 --> 26:40.481
"Hold my hands"?
Uhh!

26:40.517 --> 26:42.053
Can you believe
this piece of work?

26:44.488 --> 26:45.423
Thank you.

26:47.691 --> 26:50.658
So, do you want me to
come with you to the meet?

26:50.694 --> 26:52.994
You know, for moral support?

26:53.030 --> 26:57.331
Oh, that's sweet, but you
don't have to do that.

26:57.367 --> 26:58.933
It's happening here.

26:58.969 --> 27:01.069
<i>The goods are in the bedroom
just waiting for the buyers.</i>

27:01.105 --> 27:01.969
The bombs are in the loft.

27:02.005 --> 27:04.104
<i>Oh, you know
what you could do?</i>

27:04.140 --> 27:05.439
<i>Pack some bags for us.</i>

27:05.475 --> 27:06.873
Take anything
you care about.

27:06.909 --> 27:08.443
Uh, sure, why?

27:08.479 --> 27:10.744
I get the sense that
New York's not gonna be

27:10.780 --> 27:13.348
the best place to be
after this sale goes down.

27:13.384 --> 27:14.715
I'm thinking Bermuda.

27:14.751 --> 27:16.783
I'm sorry, did he
just say that...

27:16.819 --> 27:19.523
Yeah.
The target's New York.

27:33.363 --> 27:35.362
Dedrik could be holding Avery
in any one of these tunnels.

27:35.398 --> 27:37.534
The main split is here.

27:41.238 --> 27:42.369
Dedrik rolls
with a small crew,

27:42.405 --> 27:43.404
but he might have
hired some new guns

27:43.440 --> 27:44.537
since we stormed
the factory.

27:44.573 --> 27:46.107
And he could have set traps.

27:46.143 --> 27:47.742
All right,
so we stay on comms.

27:47.778 --> 27:49.280
Take it slow.

28:00.089 --> 28:03.023
Exterior cameras are in place,
but the sightlines aren't great.

28:03.059 --> 28:04.425
Of course, they live
in a reclaimed loft.

28:04.461 --> 28:06.260
- So predictable.
- Focus, Rich.

28:06.296 --> 28:07.527
We're here to stop
a terrorist attack,

28:07.563 --> 28:09.397
not live-snark
Boston's boyfriend.

28:09.433 --> 28:11.298
Patterson, make sure
all the undercover units

28:11.334 --> 28:13.266
keep their low profile.
No one goes anywhere

28:13.302 --> 28:15.168
until Boston
gets visual confirmation

28:15.204 --> 28:16.706
- the sale's going down.
- Copy that.

28:18.774 --> 28:19.840
Okay, that's not ideal.

28:19.876 --> 28:22.275
A delivery truck just
blocked the front entrance.

28:22.311 --> 28:24.411
Hey, should I pack
the seersucker?

28:24.447 --> 28:27.814
You know, I'm not a fan
of the seersucker.

28:27.850 --> 28:29.116
Doesn't really suit you.

28:29.152 --> 28:31.651
- Oh. See what I did?
- Yeah.

28:31.687 --> 28:33.320
You know, I bought him
that suit in Nantucket

28:33.356 --> 28:34.522
for his birthday.

28:34.558 --> 28:35.755
What's that?

28:35.791 --> 28:37.291
It's a new bug detector.

28:37.327 --> 28:38.591
Can't hide from this baby.

28:38.627 --> 28:41.227
Picks up even the newest
generation wires.

28:41.263 --> 28:43.097
Great, that... that's amazing.

28:43.133 --> 28:44.231
I gotta make sure
I'm not selling

28:44.267 --> 28:45.265
to a bunch of feds,
right?

28:45.301 --> 28:48.769
Yeah, you do.
Or, you don't.

28:48.805 --> 28:50.674
You do not want that.

28:52.842 --> 28:56.811
- He killed the wire.
- It's okay. He's still got his cell.

28:56.847 --> 29:00.246
(beeping)

29:00.282 --> 29:01.819
(doorbell rings)

29:07.557 --> 29:11.328
It's T.J.
Show time!

29:12.761 --> 29:15.596
Oh, sorry, babe.
There's no signal.

29:15.632 --> 29:17.831
I set up a jammer.
Business.

29:17.867 --> 29:19.265
Oh, yeah, it's no problem.

29:19.301 --> 29:20.700
I was just checking
the weather in Bermuda

29:20.736 --> 29:22.535
to see what the weather
was in Bermuda.

29:22.571 --> 29:26.276
Always thinking.
I love that about you.

29:35.217 --> 29:38.555
Hey!
We got something over here.

29:45.162 --> 29:46.327
All right,
three heat signatures.

29:46.363 --> 29:48.195
(Jane)
Okay, you blast the doors.

29:48.231 --> 29:49.567
I'll go in first.

29:50.166 --> 29:53.734
(explosion)

29:53.770 --> 29:56.337
(gunfire)

29:56.373 --> 29:59.305
Avery, okay, okay.

29:59.341 --> 30:00.840
You're gonna be okay,
all right?

30:00.876 --> 30:02.176
You're gonna be okay.

30:02.212 --> 30:03.580
It's you.

30:05.514 --> 30:08.282
How many more are
down here?

30:08.318 --> 30:09.854
Two.
I think two.

30:11.354 --> 30:13.154
Okay, get up,
come on.

30:13.190 --> 30:14.889
Get in there.

30:14.925 --> 30:17.224
Listen to me. I want you
to stay in there.

30:17.260 --> 30:19.360
Don't move until we've cleared the
tunnels and come back for you.

30:19.396 --> 30:20.427
- Okay.
- You understand?

30:20.463 --> 30:22.165
- Yeah, yeah.
- Don't move.

30:24.600 --> 30:26.266
Let's go.

30:26.302 --> 30:28.302
Welcome.

30:28.338 --> 30:29.169
T.J., this is Boston.

30:29.205 --> 30:31.338
Ah.
Hello there, T.J.

30:31.374 --> 30:32.372
Nice to meet you.

30:32.408 --> 30:34.440
Um, I'm just gonna
put on some tea.

30:34.476 --> 30:36.546
Would anyone
like some biscuits?

30:37.847 --> 30:39.713
I'll...
I'll put some out anyway.

30:39.749 --> 30:41.549
(chuckles)

30:41.585 --> 30:42.815
Did you bring the cash?

30:42.851 --> 30:44.454
Of course.

30:47.389 --> 30:50.694
Wonderful.
I'll get your toys.

30:52.361 --> 30:56.166
Would anyone like
some milk or lemon?

30:58.768 --> 31:01.472
Uh, okay.

31:04.741 --> 31:06.306
Buyer should have
been here by now.

31:06.342 --> 31:08.708
Okay. No one saw
any suspicious vehicles,

31:08.744 --> 31:11.411
but the delivery vans are still
blocking both entrances.

31:11.447 --> 31:12.745
Maybe they slipped by.

31:12.781 --> 31:14.481
Okay, his phone is going
straight to voicemail.

31:14.517 --> 31:16.216
He's been cut off. We gotta
go in, right? We go in?

31:16.252 --> 31:17.952
(Reade) If we go in too early,
the Dabbur Zann guys could

31:17.988 --> 31:20.257
- slip right through our fingers.
- Is that smoke?

31:21.457 --> 31:22.956
That's Boston.

31:22.992 --> 31:25.391
That's Boston,
he's giving a signal.

31:25.427 --> 31:29.330
Oh, my God,
I am so sorry!

31:29.366 --> 31:31.599
What's going on?
Smells like fire.

31:31.635 --> 31:33.934
I forgot to put water
in the kettle.

31:33.970 --> 31:35.302
I'm so embarrassed, I...

31:35.338 --> 31:38.408
This I why I should
never multitask.

31:39.309 --> 31:41.908
Sorry.
We'll make this quick.

31:41.944 --> 31:43.414
White phosphorus bombs.

31:44.414 --> 31:45.512
As promised.

31:45.548 --> 31:47.447
You know,
I... I have bialys,

31:47.483 --> 31:50.383
if... if anyone would
like to just stay,

31:50.419 --> 31:52.285
have a nibble, or...

31:52.321 --> 31:54.588
What are you doing?

31:54.624 --> 31:57.323
I'm just trying to be
a good host.

31:57.359 --> 31:59.963
- Why are you acting weird?
- (gun cocks)

32:01.764 --> 32:02.932
I...

32:05.299 --> 32:05.299
(electricity powers down)

32:05.335 --> 32:08.472
(gunfire and shouting)

32:14.344 --> 32:17.314
(electricity powers up)

32:27.490 --> 32:28.692
(Reade)
Don't move.

32:33.963 --> 32:35.361
Boston!

32:35.397 --> 32:38.331
Hey, you okay?

32:38.367 --> 32:39.535
- Yeah.
- It's okay.

32:40.537 --> 32:42.302
Sanjay Bonthala,
you're under arrest

32:42.338 --> 32:44.405
for blackmail,
extortion, arms dealing,

32:44.441 --> 32:46.977
and conspiracy to commit
a terrorist act.

32:47.844 --> 32:49.642
And for being a bit much!

32:49.678 --> 32:52.482
Enjoy super max, jackweed!

33:01.491 --> 33:02.559
(gunfire)

33:08.530 --> 33:11.668
Well, that's not the hello
I was hoping for.

33:13.470 --> 33:15.569
South tunnel is clear.
Heading back to Avery.

33:15.605 --> 33:18.409
Clem, Weller. Copy.

33:19.842 --> 33:21.408
Avery.

33:21.444 --> 33:22.342
(gun cocks)

33:22.378 --> 33:25.014
Don't move.

33:29.496 --> 33:33.533
- Avery.
- Just put the gun down and let me walk away.

33:37.738 --> 33:41.272
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Talk to me.

33:41.308 --> 33:44.542
Roman said you'd pretend to know
what I was going through.

33:44.578 --> 33:47.611
That you'd lie
and promise to protect me.

33:47.647 --> 33:49.347
You still trust him?

33:49.383 --> 33:52.350
He kidnapped you,
he held you for months.

33:52.386 --> 33:55.419
- Roman is the liar.
- I know that.

33:55.455 --> 33:57.988
I don't trust him
anymore, but...

33:58.024 --> 33:59.689
I also don't trust you.

33:59.725 --> 34:02.026
I know you'll just throw me
in a cell like you did to him.

34:02.062 --> 34:03.561
Look, Roman killed
innocent people.

34:03.597 --> 34:05.829
Why should I listen
to anything you say?

34:05.865 --> 34:07.400
You abandoned me.

34:08.467 --> 34:11.568
No... No, my mother
took you from me.

34:11.603 --> 34:14.271
- I would never have...
- Roman said you'd blame her.

34:14.306 --> 34:16.407
Shepherd, right?

34:16.443 --> 34:19.010
Roman manipulated you.

34:19.045 --> 34:20.643
You have to see that.

34:20.679 --> 34:24.649
He twisted things
to turn you against me.

34:24.685 --> 34:26.254
It's what he does.

34:28.321 --> 34:29.351
(taps)

34:29.388 --> 34:31.289
You can't get to me,

34:31.324 --> 34:32.688
and I can't get to you.

34:32.725 --> 34:35.059
See, they...
they built this room

34:35.094 --> 34:39.329
after the Berlin Wall went up
so that enemies could talk

34:39.364 --> 34:42.931
face to face
without threat of death.

34:42.967 --> 34:45.768
So, here we are.

34:45.804 --> 34:47.804
What are you
doing here, Roman?

34:47.841 --> 34:50.373
I jumped on the first flight
as soon as Dedrik told me

34:50.409 --> 34:52.042
you were on the case.

34:52.078 --> 34:54.411
I just thought it was time
that we had a little chat.

34:54.447 --> 34:56.414
You've got nothing
on me now.

34:56.449 --> 34:57.814
I told Jane everything.

34:57.850 --> 35:00.620
Really?
Everything?

35:02.022 --> 35:03.391
How'd she take it?

35:04.857 --> 35:07.057
(chuckles)

35:07.093 --> 35:08.892
I am sorry to hear that.

35:08.928 --> 35:10.760
You set me up.

35:10.796 --> 35:12.796
You used a child!

35:12.832 --> 35:14.398
Your own niece!

35:14.434 --> 35:16.434
Well, she was
more than willing.

35:16.470 --> 35:17.600
See, unlike you and Jane,

35:17.636 --> 35:19.740
she understands
what has to be done.

35:20.740 --> 35:22.740
Whatever it is
that you have planned,

35:22.776 --> 35:26.110
whatever lies you're
feeding her, it's over.

35:26.146 --> 35:28.412
You can't
control her anymore.

35:28.448 --> 35:32.082
Maybe, but I still got
a lot of moves left.

35:32.118 --> 35:34.552
You'll see soon enough.

35:34.588 --> 35:38.055
Now, Avery, you need me
to get out of here.

35:38.091 --> 35:39.490
Roman's gonna
come after you.

35:39.526 --> 35:40.957
He's not on your side.

35:40.993 --> 35:42.892
And you are?

35:42.928 --> 35:44.762
You're my daughter.

35:44.798 --> 35:47.564
I've survived
my whole life without you.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.532
I've never needed you,

35:49.568 --> 35:50.901
and I'm not about
to start now.

35:50.937 --> 35:52.970
That's fine.

35:53.006 --> 35:55.405
But please come with me.

35:55.441 --> 35:57.807
You will have
full FBI protection.

35:57.843 --> 36:00.477
If you don't want to see me
after that, you don't have to.

36:00.513 --> 36:03.146
What's the alternative?

36:03.182 --> 36:05.383
Look at where you are.

36:05.419 --> 36:08.455
Does this feel
like where you belong?

36:11.892 --> 36:14.828
(sobbing)

36:15.961 --> 36:17.595
It's okay.

36:17.631 --> 36:20.497
Weller, when are you
gonna realize that

36:20.533 --> 36:22.499
we are on
the same side of this?

36:22.535 --> 36:24.968
Crawford is the target,

36:25.004 --> 36:28.071
but I need you and the FBI
if we're gonna bring him down,

36:28.107 --> 36:29.472
and you need me.

36:29.508 --> 36:30.608
You may not agree
with my methods,

36:30.644 --> 36:32.412
but we both want
the same result.

36:33.613 --> 36:36.414
Any way that
you spin this, Roman...

36:36.450 --> 36:38.716
it ends in the same way.

36:38.752 --> 36:42.086
With you, alone.

36:42.122 --> 36:43.591
Aren't you getting
tired of that?

36:45.825 --> 36:47.557
I've seen what my life
could have looked like

36:47.593 --> 36:49.963
if none of this
ever happened to me.

36:51.997 --> 36:55.099
But that's just not
in the cards for me.

36:55.135 --> 36:57.834
No.
It's not.

36:57.870 --> 37:00.838
Because Avery was
your last chance.

37:00.874 --> 37:02.606
You manipulated her,

37:02.642 --> 37:05.075
you used her,

37:05.111 --> 37:07.010
and you lied to her.

37:07.046 --> 37:08.845
You did the same thing

37:08.881 --> 37:11.948
that Shepherd has
done to you...

37:11.984 --> 37:14.521
for your whole life.

37:16.055 --> 37:17.521
(taps)

37:17.557 --> 37:20.026
You're very lucky
this glass is doing its job.

37:32.571 --> 37:33.506
(door bangs shut)

37:51.156 --> 37:52.559
(sighs)

37:53.225 --> 37:55.191
How's she doing?

37:55.227 --> 37:57.731
(sighs)
She's sleeping.

37:58.597 --> 38:00.664
I want to apologize

38:00.700 --> 38:03.501
for how I acted
with Clem.

38:03.537 --> 38:05.568
He's a good guy.

38:05.604 --> 38:08.171
Just the thought of you
with someone else.

38:08.207 --> 38:10.240
I'm sorry, too.

38:10.276 --> 38:11.908
I should have told you.

38:11.944 --> 38:14.615
We all should have
done a lot of things.

38:17.149 --> 38:18.649
You think she'll be okay?

38:18.685 --> 38:21.622
Yeah.
She's tough.

38:22.656 --> 38:24.658
Just like her mother.

38:31.564 --> 38:34.597
Boston, you did the
right thing coming in.

38:34.633 --> 38:35.932
You prevented
a major terror attack,

38:35.968 --> 38:39.169
so for that reason alone,
you won't be charged.

38:39.205 --> 38:40.937
But you will be held
in indefinite house arrest.

38:40.973 --> 38:44.140
Come on, doesn't that
seem a little extreme?

38:44.176 --> 38:46.843
You used my app to hack
80 million people.

38:46.879 --> 38:48.982
Does it make a difference
if I'm sorry?

38:51.651 --> 38:53.684
Truly.

38:53.720 --> 38:55.923
I... I should never
have done that.

38:57.323 --> 38:58.956
You were a... a friend.

38:58.992 --> 39:00.624
You helped me
when I really needed it,

39:00.660 --> 39:04.531
and... I betrayed
that kindness.

39:06.700 --> 39:08.968
An agent will take you down
to get your ankle bracelet.

39:10.035 --> 39:11.638
Wait!

39:13.039 --> 39:14.204
I love you.

39:14.240 --> 39:15.805
I've always loved you.

39:15.841 --> 39:17.807
I mean, I've pretty much
taken you for granted

39:17.843 --> 39:19.075
the entire time
we've known each other,

39:19.111 --> 39:21.345
which is inexcusable, but...

39:21.381 --> 39:23.917
almost losing you today...

39:25.618 --> 39:27.184
I'm sorry.

39:27.220 --> 39:29.119
For all of it.

39:29.155 --> 39:30.887
I have a safe house.

39:30.923 --> 39:35.158
Do you want to be under
safe house arrest with me?

39:35.194 --> 39:36.593
I can't authorize that.

39:36.629 --> 39:38.765
Can you just give me
a second, please?

39:42.267 --> 39:44.033
What do you say?

39:44.069 --> 39:46.740
You want to give it
another shot?

39:48.107 --> 39:50.944
I have been wanting
to hear that for so long.

39:53.680 --> 39:56.082
But you should have
said it two years ago.

40:11.830 --> 40:13.196
Where you off to now?

40:13.232 --> 40:14.331
I don't know.

40:14.367 --> 40:15.932
Wherever the next job takes me.

40:15.968 --> 40:18.638
But I'm glad
I came on this one.

40:19.738 --> 40:21.738
Look, I'm... I'm sorry

40:21.774 --> 40:23.374
if I was a little cold.

40:23.410 --> 40:26.075
Yeah, I would have
been the same.

40:26.111 --> 40:27.711
Jane's an amazing woman.

40:27.747 --> 40:28.912
I hope you guys work it out.

40:28.948 --> 40:32.416
I'm not sure
that's in the cards anymore.

40:32.452 --> 40:34.187
She still loves you.

40:35.854 --> 40:37.320
Trust me.

40:37.356 --> 40:39.025
I wish she didn't.

40:53.305 --> 40:55.271
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:55.307 --> 40:56.309
Uh...

40:57.843 --> 40:59.075
Do you want
to grab a bite?

40:59.111 --> 41:00.778
There's just some...

41:00.814 --> 41:03.079
some stuff I wanted
to talk to you about.

41:03.115 --> 41:04.448
Yeah, sure.

41:04.484 --> 41:06.015
Um...

41:06.051 --> 41:08.222
- (locker slams)
- I wanted to show you something.

41:15.495 --> 41:17.861
Think she'll like it?

41:17.897 --> 41:19.729
Uh...

41:19.765 --> 41:21.398
- No, I...
- What?

41:21.434 --> 41:23.970
I think she'll love it.

41:30.109 --> 41:33.410
- (monitor beeping)
- (phone vibrating)

41:33.446 --> 41:35.082
I'll be right back.

41:38.084 --> 41:39.483
Hello?

41:39.519 --> 41:41.785
(Roman)
<i>Hello, Jane.</i>

41:41.821 --> 41:43.924
I'm sorry we missed
each other in Berlin.

41:45.225 --> 41:46.957
It's over, Roman.
You lost.

41:46.993 --> 41:49.126
<i>Is that what your heart's
really telling you?</i>

41:49.162 --> 41:52.229
You know, getting your daughter
back might feel like a victory,

41:52.265 --> 41:55.265
<i>but that will change.</i>

41:55.301 --> 41:57.805
Enjoy it while it lasts.
