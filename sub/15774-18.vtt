What?

02:59.242 --> 03:01.643
My whole life
I've wanted to play piano,

03:01.678 --> 03:03.979
but I always said, tomorrow.

03:04.013 --> 03:05.481
I'll learn tomorrow.

Why piano?

03:15.527 --> 03:16.794
My grand mummy played.

03:16.828 --> 03:20.331
I distinctly remember
listening by her side

03:20.366 --> 03:23.334
as she tickled the ivories.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.270
I would dance
as she filled the room

03:25.304 --> 03:29.641
with the sounds of Chopin,
Bach, Jerry Lee Lewis.

03:29.676 --> 03:31.810
She offered
to teach me many times,

03:31.845 --> 03:34.880
but my answer
was always the same--

03:34.915 --> 03:36.582
tomorrow, grand mummy.

03:36.617 --> 03:40.153
I'll learn to play tomorrow.

03:42.090 --> 03:46.693
So now do you see why I must
learn to play the piano?

03:46.728 --> 03:48.262
Ehh, not really.

03:48.296 --> 03:49.797
But whatever floats your boat.

03:49.831 --> 03:54.535
Then it's settled. Tomorrow
I will learn to play piano.

03:54.569 --> 03:55.769
Don't you mean today?

03:55.804 --> 03:59.140
Nah, it's kind of late,
it's almost dinner time.

03:59.174 --> 04:00.341
Oh, I'm starving.

No, we didn't!

04:27.134 --> 04:28.801
Well, no, not explicitly.

04:28.835 --> 04:30.235
But yesterday's conversation

04:30.270 --> 04:33.239

with undertones and innuendos.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.040
You said,
whatever floats your boat.

04:35.075 --> 04:38.677
And selling your TV to buy
myself a piano floats my boat.

you're really saying is,

04:41.615 --> 04:44.150
you want to sink my boat.

they're wrapping it up,

11:53.088 --> 11:55.155
you know, I just say,
"I know what you mean."

11:55.189 --> 11:56.956
I'm actually
a pretty great listener,

11:56.991 --> 11:59.071
as long as I don't have
to hear what anyone's saying.

11:59.093 --> 12:02.512
Have you, uh, ever used
those things on me?

12:02.632 --> 12:04.963
What?! No!

12:04.998 --> 12:07.298
So yesterday
when I was telling you

12:07.333 --> 12:09.667
about that recurring dream
I've been having,

12:09.702 --> 12:11.172
you were listening?

12:11.292 --> 12:13.052
To every word.

12:13.172 --> 12:15.239
Phew! Ok, good.

12:15.273 --> 12:17.474
Because I had it again
last night!

12:17.509 --> 12:19.076
It's the strangest thing.

12:19.110 --> 12:22.513
It's like, I'm in my house,
but I'm not in my house.

12:22.548 --> 12:25.383
And it's like everything's
in black and white.

12:25.417 --> 12:29.277
And I can smell someone making
breakfast, like buttered toast,

12:29.397 --> 12:32.724
but then I go into the kitchen
and no one's there.

12:32.759 --> 12:34.092
Uh-huh.

12:34.127 --> 12:37.163
I mean, I feel like the dream has
something to do with my mother.

12:37.197 --> 12:39.632
Or maybe my sister.
Whatever the case,

12:39.666 --> 12:41.500
it's very unsettling.

12:41.535 --> 12:43.069
I know what you mean.

12:43.373 --> 12:45.544
Thanks, Bugs.

12:45.664 --> 12:47.773
You going to eat that?

12:47.808 --> 12:50.676
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, ok.

12:50.711 --> 12:53.112
Sorry.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.952
Oh, no.

12:58.661 --> 12:59.698
No.

13:02.255 --> 13:03.275
No.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.372
Here, let's try it together.

13:06.406 --> 13:09.808
[Playing
"Grand Old Duke of York"]

13:23.757 --> 13:26.926
["Grand Old Duke of York"

14:03.129 --> 14:04.296
Well?

14:04.330 --> 14:08.133
Do I finally get a gold star?

14:08.167 --> 14:09.200
[Door opens]

14:09.235 --> 14:12.108
Unbelievable!
Just unbelievable.

14:12.228 --> 14:13.366
Ughh.

14:15.808 --> 14:20.211
I've been practicing forever
and I'm still not any better.

14:20.245 --> 14:21.912
What is wrong with me?

14:21.947 --> 14:25.249
What do you think?
I need you to be honest.

14:25.283 --> 14:28.385
I want the truth.
Don't hold back.

14:28.420 --> 14:31.088
Do you think I should
quit piano?

14:31.122 --> 14:32.623
- Uh-huh.
- I knew it!

14:32.657 --> 14:34.973
This whole thing's been
a giant waste of time.

14:35.093 --> 14:37.960
And it's proof that I should
never try anything again. Ever.

14:38.080 --> 14:41.965
Because I will fail.
I fail at everything.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.433
Uh-huh.

14:43.468 --> 14:44.301
So why try?

14:44.336 --> 14:46.036
I just shouldn't ever try,
right?

14:46.071 --> 14:48.672
Because when you try,
you expose yourself

14:48.707 --> 14:51.108
to the possibility of failure.

14:51.142 --> 14:52.576
And there's no point in trying

14:52.610 --> 14:55.011
if there's a chance
that you might fail.

14:55.046 --> 14:56.746
You know what I mean?

14:56.781 --> 14:58.581
I know what you mean.

14:58.616 --> 15:00.778
Thanks, Bugs.

15:08.825 --> 15:12.594
Pretty classy, huh?

15:16.403 --> 15:18.303
Speedy, what is all this?

15:18.337 --> 15:20.972
It's called fine dining.
Like at Sullivan's.

15:21.007 --> 15:24.610
Shrimp scampi?
Ooh, that sounds good.

15:24.644 --> 15:26.812
Then again,
I've never had it before

15:26.846 --> 15:29.649
and there's no point
in trying something new.

15:29.683 --> 15:30.683
Right, Bugs?

15:30.717 --> 15:34.587
I guess I'll just
get the buffet.

15:36.990 --> 15:37.923
[Indistinct chatter]

15:37.958 --> 15:40.860
You messed with
the wrong mouse, Sullivan's.

15:41.562 --> 15:44.631
Uh, they didn't mess
with you, Speedy.

15:44.665 --> 15:46.599
It's just another restaurant.

15:46.634 --> 15:47.834
It's my competitive nature.

15:47.868 --> 15:49.936
How did you think
I became the fastest mouse

15:49.970 --> 15:51.071
in all of Mexico? No.

15:51.105 --> 15:53.807
If Sullivan's has a buffet,
I got a buffet.

15:53.841 --> 15:56.276
If Sullivan's has shrimp scampi,
I got shrimp scampi.

15:56.310 --> 15:58.545
If Sullivan's has live music
every Friday night,

15:58.579 --> 16:02.315
I got live music
every Friday night.

16:03.417 --> 16:05.184
You've got live music tonight?

16:05.219 --> 16:06.919
Huh? What are you
talking about?

16:06.954 --> 16:09.389
- You're the one who arranged it!
- What?

16:09.423 --> 16:10.723
Please tell me this is a joke.

16:10.758 --> 16:13.393
You said you were going
to take care of everything.

16:13.427 --> 16:15.128
When did I say that?

16:15.162 --> 16:16.329
I asked you the other day.

16:16.363 --> 16:18.331
I said, I have a big favor
to ask you, and you can say no,

16:18.365 --> 16:22.502
but do you know of anyone who might be
available to perform on Friday night?

16:22.536 --> 16:23.737
And you said, uh-huh.

16:23.771 --> 16:25.071
And then I said, are you sure?

16:25.106 --> 16:28.307
And you said, uh-huh.
Then I said, thank you so much.

16:28.342 --> 16:30.076
This is such a nice gesture.

16:30.110 --> 16:31.610
You are a prince among men.

16:31.644 --> 16:33.045
And you said,
I know what you mean.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.980
Personally, I thought
that was a little bit boastful,

16:35.014 --> 16:38.317
but I'm not in a position
to judge, so I said, whatever.

16:38.351 --> 16:39.918
And here we are.

16:39.953 --> 16:41.887
Ehh, hypothetically,

16:41.921 --> 16:43.355

16:43.390 --> 16:46.825
um, what would happen if,
for some reason,

16:46.860 --> 16:49.228
there was no live
entertainment tonight?

16:49.262 --> 16:52.331
Oh, not much.
Other than I will have wasted

16:52.366 --> 16:54.200
$500 on a full page ad.

16:54.235 --> 16:57.236
And all of these people will no
longer be customers of mine.

16:57.271 --> 16:59.605
They'll be customers
of Sullivan's!

16:59.640 --> 17:03.609
So please tell me
you got someone.

17:05.511 --> 17:09.047
- I got someone.
- You better.

the piano tonight.

17:15.354 --> 17:18.289

17:19.925 --> 17:21.224
What are you talking about?

17:21.260 --> 17:25.262
I asked you if I should quit,
and you said, uh-huh.

Oh, boy. Ok,
forget our conversation.

17:28.165 --> 17:30.067
Even the part about
never trying anything

17:30.102 --> 17:34.038
if there's even the slightest
chance that you might fail?

17:34.072 --> 17:35.273

17:35.307 --> 17:38.143
That's the worst advice
that anybody could ever give.

Daffy, you said you wanted
to learn how to play the piano.

17:42.348 --> 17:43.508

no matter how hard it is,
or how bad it sounds.
