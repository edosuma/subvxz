It's season six,

02:21.016 --> 02:25.018
we're upping the ante
with a double elimination
at the end of the hour.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.188

So it's a double elimination?
Right off the bat?

02:31.235 --> 02:35.154
- Those are some season six
stakes right there.
- Right?

02:35.197 --> 02:39.491
And now, let's give it up
for our panel of detectives.

And robin thicke.

02:50.838 --> 02:54.423
There it is.
Now let's kick off season six
the right way

02:54.466 --> 02:58.218
with a creature
that I smelled from about
20 blocks from here.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.599

She's gorgeous!

03:09.064 --> 03:12.357
Wow! So elaborate.

03:12.401 --> 03:16.445
Look at her.
She walks like a diva.
You go, girl.

03:16.488 --> 03:20.365
Ooh-whee, skunk.
Throw some stank on it.

03:20.367 --> 03:23.202
- Ooh!
- Robin: So glamorous.

03:23.245 --> 03:26.496
I don't ever think I've seen
a skunk with diamonds before.

03:26.498 --> 03:30.250
This is fly, but I also know
you want some clues about
her secret identity,

03:30.294 --> 03:34.213
so how about a little
show and smell?

03:38.844 --> 03:42.638

- I don't know. Who's this!

06:40.484 --> 06:43.318
- Who's that?
- We're not playing around.

06:43.362 --> 06:46.196
Season six is in
the big leagues, y'all!

06:46.240 --> 06:49.074
- Yes, that's right!
- That's what I'm saying!

06:49.118 --> 06:52.285
When she walked out, she got
that nick cannon bling on,

06:52.329 --> 06:54.579
that nick cannon drip on,
and then she sang.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.081
I was like,
that's some royalty.

- Right?
- Up there.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.753
I have no idea who you are.

07:01.797 --> 07:04.631
But thank you so much for
that beautiful performance.

07:07.136 --> 07:08.718
Okay, panel,
a whole new season

07:08.762 --> 07:12.806
means a whole new group
of first impression guesses.

07:12.850 --> 07:16.351
Y'all know the drill.
With each guess you get right,
you'll earn a point.

07:16.395 --> 07:19.271
The panelist with
the most points at
the end of the season

07:19.314 --> 07:23.567
will win the coveted
golden ear trophy.

07:23.610 --> 07:28.113
So let's find out if you're hot
or cold on who the skunk is.

07:28.157 --> 07:32.325
Write it down and drop it
into our fancy new
first impression box.

07:32.327 --> 07:35.662
Straight out the gate.
Go ahead.

07:35.664 --> 07:38.540
Nicole,
I put something special
in the box for you.

07:47.634 --> 07:50.552
There's a hand in there.

07:50.596 --> 07:54.264
- Come on, jenny.
- That's a weird hand.

07:58.228 --> 08:02.355
All right. Time's up!
All right, skunk.

08:02.357 --> 08:05.525
Why are you here
on "the masked singer"?

08:05.569 --> 08:10.489
I felt like it was time for me
to take a big leap

08:10.491 --> 08:13.450
and do something
that I hadn't done
in a long time.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.994
Robin:
Well, you can tell,
that voice,

08:15.996 --> 08:18.205
that she's been singing
her whole life.

08:18.207 --> 08:20.582
She said she was focused
on her family for a while.

08:20.626 --> 08:22.083
So what do you got, robin?
What you--

08:22.127 --> 08:25.086
well, it ain't none
of your business.

08:25.088 --> 08:28.465
You know, I mean, some
of the gloria gaynor names.

08:28.509 --> 08:30.008
Even I felt
for a second there--

08:30.052 --> 08:33.011
I felt a little faith evans
in the vocal.

08:33.055 --> 08:34.513
But in the lower register
that's faith,

08:34.556 --> 08:35.472
but not in the upper register.

08:35.766 --> 08:38.099
But I like that wheelhouse
that you're in.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.143
I just feel like this
is someone huge.

08:40.229 --> 08:42.145
The "d" has got
to stand for something.

08:42.189 --> 08:45.440
- Like, diva.
- Well, let's just
name some divas.

08:45.484 --> 08:47.192
Let's do it then.
A'ight? Let's do it.

08:47.227 --> 08:50.070
- Hunt them down, ken.
- I'll do it, nick!

08:50.072 --> 08:52.155
- I dare you.
- Okay.

08:52.199 --> 08:57.160
Janet jackson. Erykah badu.
Alicia keys! Anita baker.

08:57.162 --> 09:00.914
This sounds exactly
like anita baker to me.

09:00.916 --> 09:04.251
- No, it doesn't.
- It sounds exactly
like anita baker.

09:04.294 --> 09:08.964
Wait, what about another legend,
icon, diva, mary j. Blige?

09:09.007 --> 09:12.008
- That's-- oh!
- I love mary.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.010
I'll jump in. Toni braxton.

09:14.054 --> 09:17.055
Ken: All right. Sade.
There you go. Boom!

09:17.099 --> 09:20.475
- Right off the top
of my mind great!
- It's no ordinary guess.

09:20.519 --> 09:24.938
- He just named every
black woman who could sing.
- How dare you, nick?

09:24.982 --> 09:28.108
- How dare you?
- Well, one thing we do know,

09:28.151 --> 09:31.778
we saw a beautiful performance.
Great job, skunk.

09:31.822 --> 09:35.156
You could tell though,
just her essence walking out,
that this is a diva.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.533
She looked like,
"I'm gonna take my time."

09:36.577 --> 09:41.538
- yes.
- Now on to our next
group a contender.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.332

premiere performance,
my friend!

12:44.222 --> 12:47.974
- Whoo!
- It was amazing.

12:48.018 --> 12:50.092
You brought that

12:50.103 --> 12:51.978

brought last season.

12:52.022 --> 12:55.440
Now I want to party with you!

12:55.442 --> 12:57.442
Nick: Well, you know what?
It's our favorite part
of the show.

12:57.486 --> 12:59.444
Time for your first
impression guesses.

12:59.488 --> 13:01.362
This is not our favorite
part of the show.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.448
It's like getting
a root canal.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.493
Should I go?
I'm ready to rock.

13:06.495 --> 13:09.579
He knows. He thinks he knows.
He's got this one.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.664
- All right.
- All right.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.459
Let's see what we got in here.
Oh! Oh, thank you.

13:14.494 --> 13:17.253
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, good. I needed that.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.464
- He's still handsome,
ladies and gentlemen.
- I needed that.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.507
- Oh!
- You got a thumbs up.

13:20.801 --> 13:24.469
I have affirmation.
That's better than a mirror.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.348
Yo, what's up? That's right.

13:28.350 --> 13:31.050
You know how it is.
You know how we do.

13:31.061 --> 13:34.270
- Aww.
- Last but not least.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.940
This thing scares me
a little bit. There we go.

13:36.942 --> 13:39.067
- Oh!
- Oh!

13:39.110 --> 13:42.946
- Somebody help jenny.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:42.948 --> 13:44.072
It's getting a little frisky.

13:44.074 --> 13:45.323
I kind of liked it.

13:45.367 --> 13:51.120
All right, octopus,
why "the masked singer"?

13:51.164 --> 13:54.958
My mom,
it's her favorite show.

13:55.001 --> 13:58.086
I knew it.
I knew I love octopus.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.420
I know! He's a mama's boy.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.215
Yeah, I am.
Just a little bit.

14:02.259 --> 14:05.343
How could I not think
this is a basketball player?

14:05.345 --> 14:08.680
And the one
that is dinging in my head
that kind of--

14:08.723 --> 14:11.099
I think I've seen him
dress like that,

14:11.142 --> 14:15.103
- is dennis rodman.
- Ken: That's a good guess.

14:15.146 --> 14:18.022
But as the resident
nba expert,

14:18.066 --> 14:21.985
- I think I know...
- All: Exactly who this is.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.361
- Thank you.
- Who is it, ken?

14:23.363 --> 14:25.864
I don't know,
and I'll tell you why.

14:25.907 --> 14:29.284
This is definitely someone,
I believe, is an nba player.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.536
- This could be chris webber,
- I thought about webber.

14:31.580 --> 14:33.997
- Anthony davis, but then--
- he's funny.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.331
Someone very funny,
and this is someone

14:35.667 --> 14:39.210
who I actually think
I worked with years ago
on an adidas ad.

14:39.254 --> 14:42.255
- Dwight howard.
- You ain't worked
with no dwight howard.

14:42.299 --> 14:45.174
I worked with dwight howard!
Let me tell you.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.426
Doing what?
What would you--

14:46.469 --> 14:50.096
I was his valet!
And let me tell you something.

14:50.140 --> 14:54.183
You're talking
about the big grin
and had a fall from grace.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.228
He was at the los angeles lakers
eight, nine years ago.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.563
Came back last year.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.064
Won a chip with lebron,

15:00.066 --> 15:03.359
with a very vital part
of that championship.

15:03.361 --> 15:06.529
- That is true.
- But, you know,
he can really sing.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.406
Right, right.
I don't know if dwight
can sing that-- yeah.

15:08.450 --> 15:12.327
Well, you know who can sing
that is a basketball player?

15:12.329 --> 15:16.456
- Who?
- Shaquille o'neal, okay?

15:16.499 --> 15:18.917
- One of the great
vocalists of our time.
- Yup.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.336
- Shaq got platinum records.
- He was a laker.

15:21.379 --> 15:26.466
- He was a laker. Exactly.
- Doesn't shaq have a little
more of a dad bod right now?

15:26.509 --> 15:28.092
- Oh!
- Sorry, shaq.

15:28.136 --> 15:29.427
He could have on
on a waist trainer.

15:29.471 --> 15:31.971
Shaq spanx. Shanks.
That's what they called it.

15:32.015 --> 15:37.101
Oh, my god! That's a little
shaq right there.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.603
Well, one thing we do know,

15:38.647 --> 15:41.981
you really "octo-pied"
are hearts.

15:42.025 --> 15:44.025
Where are you going?

15:44.069 --> 15:49.530
- He's soaking it all up
with all them legs.
- That was amazing!

15:49.574 --> 15:52.742
Now if this is any indication
of the kind of talent
we have this season,

- Ken: Oh! Look at that.
- I know who that is.

19:54.444 --> 19:55.818
A lot of people
tap nick's butt.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.778
Not going to get
anything from that.

19:57.822 --> 20:03.534
She got me stumped.
Like that performance,
I was just transfixed.

20:03.578 --> 20:06.454
- You're like a natural
performer out there.
- Yeah.

20:06.497 --> 20:10.124

here rapping, too.
- Yeah. There was some swag.

20:10.168 --> 20:13.502
It looked like
she's done that on tiktok
a few times or something.

20:13.546 --> 20:17.548
- Yes!
- Okay, panel, who is
the mystery puffer fish?

20:17.550 --> 20:21.510
- Write them down!
- I have no idea who this is.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.347
- I have no idea.
- Right over there.
Put it in that box.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.807
I don't know who this is!
It's driving me crazy!

20:26.851 --> 20:29.769
I don't know who it is.

20:29.771 --> 20:31.354
Thank you.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.402
Ooh, I want to dance
with this hand.

20:38.446 --> 20:41.405
All right. Stop flirting
with the fragile box.

20:47.080 --> 20:51.165
All right,
why the puffer fish?

20:51.209 --> 20:56.295
- Because she is
queen of the sea!
- Ooh.

20:56.339 --> 20:59.173
Nicole: I kind of got,
like, I don't know,
a stand-up vibe.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.050
I also saw a disco ball.

21:01.094 --> 21:03.552
That made me
think of the '70s,
minnie riperton.

21:03.596 --> 21:06.305
- Right.
- Minnie riperton's daughter
is maya rudolph.

21:06.349 --> 21:10.685
- Good guess.
- But then the dancer body,
and so cute and petite.

21:10.728 --> 21:14.605
I'm kind of getting
paula abdul vibes
right now, maybe.

21:14.649 --> 21:17.066
Oh! Snap!

21:17.068 --> 21:18.776
Ooh, that's a good one,
nicole.

21:18.820 --> 21:19.610
Ken:
I think it's a stand-up.

21:19.862 --> 21:20.778
Literally,
just right off the cuff,

21:21.322 --> 21:24.782
I was thinking of the star
of "insecure," issa rae is--

21:24.826 --> 21:27.535
just kind of fits the bill.

21:27.578 --> 21:31.831
- Is issa rae very tall or--
- well, nick is 4'6.

21:31.874 --> 21:37.420
And issa feels very secure
standing next to nick cannon.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.463
- Right.
- That was bad. That was bad.

21:39.507 --> 21:42.633
You know who I thought of
when I first saw--
and I saw the dancing,

21:42.677 --> 21:45.303
I think about her with her kids
dancing on tiktok,

21:45.346 --> 21:47.054
- I'm thinking jessica alba.
- Jessica alba.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.389
I was thinking
the same thing!

21:48.433 --> 21:52.310
- That's a good guess.
- I love that guess.

21:52.353 --> 21:55.813
- Great guess and also
great performance.
- Yes!

21:55.857 --> 21:58.858

- Mommy and daddy right here.

25:56.305 --> 25:58.389
- Oh, my goodness.
- Okay, panel.

25:58.432 --> 26:01.976
It's time for your
first impression guesses.

26:02.019 --> 26:03.394
Mother nature's

26:03.437 --> 26:07.064

Yeah. They're all going
to be right, nick.

26:15.199 --> 26:18.742
He's going

26:20.580 --> 26:22.580
Hang loose, babe. Shaka!

26:22.623 --> 26:23.831

26:23.874 --> 26:26.625
All right, hand. Let's go!

26:26.669 --> 26:29.169
Yass, honey, yass!

26:29.171 --> 26:31.463
Ugh, I hate not knowing!

26:31.507 --> 26:35.509
Okay, mother nature,
why did you choose
mother nature?

26:35.553 --> 26:41.181
Because mother nature is
a force to be reckoned with.

26:41.225 --> 26:45.644
She's beautiful and scary
at the same time.

26:45.688 --> 26:48.314
- That's right.
- I feel like it's got
to be a comedian.

26:48.316 --> 26:51.317
- Right?
- Someone like aisha tyler.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.194
- Yeah.
- But there's something
about her

26:54.196 --> 26:56.572
that just screams
tiffany haddish, right?

26:56.616 --> 26:58.741
- That's what I think.
- Yeah, I mean,
just got that kind of

26:58.784 --> 27:01.493

- Yeah!

27:01.537 --> 27:03.662

the she ready
dance again, ken.

27:05.791 --> 27:06.957

27:08.252 --> 27:10.878

it could be is, well,

27:10.921 --> 27:14.798
somebody who just is
all about a good time,
who's also a comedian.

27:14.842 --> 27:18.719
She's always posting naked
with mother nature
on her instagram.

27:18.763 --> 27:20.179
That's chelsea handler, y'all.

27:20.222 --> 27:23.223
- Right?
- Chelsea handler.

27:23.267 --> 27:27.269
I know chelsea.
I'm good friends with her.
I don't feel like it's chelsea.

27:27.313 --> 27:30.898
Well, you know, the energy,
the swag, the dance moves,
doesn't have children,

27:30.941 --> 27:34.652
- I think it's
tracee ellis ross.
- Wow. Good guess.

27:34.654 --> 27:37.613
And just on principle,
she would come out
singing her mom's song.

27:37.657 --> 27:41.116
- Oh! I love it!
- I love you, tracee.
Thank you for coming.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.827
- Thank you, baby.
- Aah!

27:43.871 --> 27:46.705

27:46.707 --> 27:51.960
Now go ahead and take your
mother nature self backstage.

27:53.464 --> 27:56.215

- Look at that trunk.

32:30.532 --> 32:33.575

guesses are in.
- And they were awful.

32:33.619 --> 32:38.038
All right. Bull, clearly
you've got the skills.

32:38.082 --> 32:40.582
Why come here to
"the masked singer"?

32:40.626 --> 32:44.294
Well, nick, you might find
this as a huge surprise,

32:44.296 --> 32:48.465
but I'm actually quite shy
about singing, so...

32:48.509 --> 32:52.219
- What?
- Wow. That looked like
a professional to me.

32:52.262 --> 32:54.137
That looks like
a superstar to me.

32:54.181 --> 32:56.881
Oh, gosh, you know,
when I saw the astronaut--

32:56.892 --> 32:59.393
that just made me think.
Could that be a connection
to hunter hayes?

32:59.436 --> 33:01.853
- Oh, yeah.
- Astronaut earlier
on one of our seasons.

33:01.897 --> 33:05.107
True that,
but also lance bass

33:05.150 --> 33:05.941
wanted to go
to outer space.

33:05.985 --> 33:07.275
You think that's lance bass?

33:07.528 --> 33:09.236
- No, I don't think
it's lance bass.
- I was about to say.

33:09.279 --> 33:10.988
But I think there might be
a boy band in there.

33:11.031 --> 33:14.825
I think there could be--
it could be brian littrell,
who can sing.

33:14.868 --> 33:16.284
- He can sing.
- And he's got moves.

33:16.328 --> 33:20.622
- The backstreet bulls.
- Ah, there-- he's back, baby.

33:20.666 --> 33:24.084
I can't put my finger
on the tone of that voice.

33:24.128 --> 33:25.919
The only other person that
quickly comes to mind

33:25.963 --> 33:27.838
that sings and dances
that well is sisqó.

33:27.881 --> 33:30.716
- Oh, yeah.
- That's not a bad one, robin.

33:30.759 --> 33:32.884
Well, he can do it all.
Sisqó can put that
performance down.

33:32.928 --> 33:36.388
- There's only
a handful of people.
- Yeah, I agree with robin.

33:36.432 --> 33:39.307
You're talking about someone
from hollywood to "forbes,"

33:39.351 --> 33:42.811
someone like
the brahma bull himself,
dwayne johnson, the rock.

33:42.855 --> 33:45.856
- This could be
someone like--
- what?

33:45.899 --> 33:48.483

33:48.527 --> 33:51.111

booed that quickly.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.287
- Well, it could.
- Just stop.

34:00.330 --> 34:02.039
Nicole, make some
sense out of this.

Okay, you guys, I think
I really know who this is,

34:05.461 --> 34:09.254

34:09.298 --> 34:12.424
I'm going to keep my cards
close to my heart this season,

34:12.468 --> 34:15.385
because I don't want any
of y'all snatching it, okay?

34:15.429 --> 34:16.428
I know what that feels like.

Robin:
Well, whoever you are,
you are definitely

one of the best performers
we've ever had on any season

34:22.227 --> 34:24.519

to go to the finals.
