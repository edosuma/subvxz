00:13.179 --> 00:15.390
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it. Thank you.

00:23.022 --> 00:24.566
I got this. Thank you.

00:32.407 --> 00:35.618
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry!
Let me get those for you, okay?

00:36.286 --> 00:37.829
There you go. All right.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.624
Hi there. I'll take that.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.586
Thanks. Got it.

00:56.681 --> 00:59.059
Let's meet on... Tuesday.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.268
This came for you.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.063
I am gonna have to call you back.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.067
Oh! Look, they're at it again! Jesus!

01:07.150 --> 01:08.234
What?

01:09.110 --> 01:11.404
Uh... How would you...

01:12.113 --> 01:15.366
like to work for a colleague of mine
in London?

01:16.868 --> 01:17.702
Okay.

01:18.953 --> 01:19.788
Bye.

01:21.539 --> 01:22.665

Honey, the realtor is waiting inside.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.767
She's only got ten more minutes,
so please hurry up.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.602
-Hey.
-Oh! What are you doing here?!

01:42.685 --> 01:43.561
Lisa asked me to come.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.855
Wanted me to look at this apartment
you're in love with.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.149
Lisa and I are friends, too, remember?
[mocking grunt]

01:48.233 --> 01:49.943
[mocking] I know you're friends.

01:50.902 --> 01:54.447
-Midtown's a weird neighborhood.
-Just wait till you see it, okay?

01:54.531 --> 01:56.783
-Did you get your summons?
-Yeah.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.035
Lost the best assistant I've ever had.

01:59.119 --> 02:02.497
Speaking of which, um...
it's kinda hard to withdraw

02:02.580 --> 02:04.833
that kind of summons money
without raising red flags.

02:06.584 --> 02:09.087
Are you asking me to pay
your public fornication bill?

02:09.170 --> 02:11.965
I'll pay you back, okay,
in weekly installments.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.926
Fine. Whatever. Yeah, you can work it off.

02:15.009 --> 02:16.302
Yeah, I can.

02:17.679 --> 02:18.930
Like... [grunts]

02:19.430 --> 02:22.767
-What did you just do?
-That's my "bouche larouche" right there.

[Max groans] By the way, I may have
something interesting for you.

02:46.374 --> 02:48.835
-[Ethan squeals] Yeah.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.795
I represent a huge YA writer.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.047
Named Shawna Hess.

[Max groans]

02:54.549 --> 02:56.843
I told her how talented you were,
blah, blah, blah.

-[squeals]
-She read your book. [groans]

-Can't get better exposure than that.

03:16.905 --> 03:19.282
[Ethan]
Thanks for hooking that up. [squeals]

03:19.365 --> 03:20.700
[Max] I think it's a slam dunk.

03:20.783 --> 03:22.243
[groans louder]

-Hey! Could you guys keep it down?
-[squeals]

03:24.704 --> 03:26.915
You don't have to grunt
every time you hit the ball.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.292
No, we do.
It's really good for my control.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.294
-I don't even hear myself. I'm just so--
-Really?

03:31.377 --> 03:35.298
It sounds like you're taking a shit.
In ten minutes, you've taken 3,000 shits.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.050
Not what it sounds like when I poop.

[high-pitched squeal with each bounce]

03:44.766 --> 03:46.643
Seriously, you two!

03:47.644 --> 03:51.231
A few years ago, Shawna was living
in St. Louis with a husband and four kids.

03:51.314 --> 03:54.108
But she hit it big and left it all.
And this is her life now.

03:54.192 --> 03:57.153
So I just want to warn you,
she's a little eccentric, okay?

03:57.237 --> 04:01.574
Yeah, no, I'm good. I've met a lot
of rich, successful, weird authors.

04:01.658 --> 04:05.411
Not like this. I just don't want you
to get uncomfortable and do your voices.

04:05.495 --> 04:06.913
-Max.
-Yeah?

04:06.996 --> 04:10.333
I have had dinner with Jonathan Franzen.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.377
-And he turned down Oprah.
-Right.

04:12.460 --> 04:16.756
This woman had Oprah on her yacht,
okay, and she was jealous of it.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.342
-[Ethan] Oprah was jealous of her?
-Ethan Turner.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.512
-[Shawna] E.T.
-Hi.

04:22.595 --> 04:26.224
Get in a basket and go back to space,
you freak!

04:26.307 --> 04:28.351
It's good to meet you. Wow!

04:28.851 --> 04:30.436
What you've done is...

04:31.562 --> 04:32.730
very good.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.900
-Thank you so much. I am such a huge fan.
-Thank you so much.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.444
-Shawna, how are you?
-Oh, my sweet.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.946
Wait. Sweet thing.

04:40.029 --> 04:41.656
Um, person, can we have these?

04:41.739 --> 04:45.660
Will you mind signing some of your books
for me? Thank you so much.

04:45.743 --> 04:47.954
It's just a thing I do
with everyone I meet.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.290
And, um, happy to do the same.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.958
Oh, right, of course! Um...

04:52.292 --> 04:54.252
You know what, I would really love it

04:54.335 --> 04:56.087
if you would sign...

04:58.673 --> 04:59.674
this receipt.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.427
New.

05:04.053 --> 05:08.349
I actually told him to leave
all his copies of your books at my office.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.102
-He read them all and loves them so much.
-Yeah.

05:11.185 --> 05:12.437
And you should see them.

05:12.520 --> 05:15.773
They're all dog-eared
and the spines cracked

05:15.857 --> 05:17.734
-because he read them so many times.
-Yes.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.403
-He should have brought them.
-And I told you, right?

05:20.486 --> 05:22.530
-Max, you blew it!
-I did.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.574
-What kind of agent are you?
-A bad one.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.410
-[laughing]
-Oh! No, I was just kidding.

05:27.493 --> 05:32.081
So, I hear you want to try your hand
at young adult fiction.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.249
[Ethan] Absolutely.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.544
This is the most interesting thing
happening in publishing today

05:36.627 --> 05:38.046
for the reader and writer.

05:38.129 --> 05:40.048
You know what? You're right.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.800
You are aware that the audience
is predominantly female?

05:42.884 --> 05:47.346
-Sweetheart, you want some cucumber water?
-Oh, no, baby, I'm good. Thank you.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.307
-This is my husband, Sean.
-Hey.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.392
Hi. Sean and Shawna?

05:51.476 --> 05:52.935
-Shawna and Sean.
-[Ethan] Right.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.520
My real name is Mark.

05:54.604 --> 05:55.521
[chuckles]

05:55.730 --> 05:58.399
[Shawna chuckles]
We're having a meeting, baby. Bye.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.320
Yeah, back into the...
back into your place.

06:02.403 --> 06:05.823
There's two things that matter,
nipples and butts. He's got all three.

06:06.657 --> 06:10.495
So the thing that makes my work resonate
with young women

06:10.578 --> 06:14.082
is a thing I'd like to call
"bathtub moments."

06:14.165 --> 06:17.376
Yes. I don't, uh... What is that?

06:17.460 --> 06:20.296
That moment of romantic longing
that makes a 14-year-old girl

06:20.380 --> 06:23.007
want to shut herself in the bathroom,
light some candles,

06:23.091 --> 06:25.093
and explore in the tub.
[mutters] You know?

06:25.176 --> 06:27.553
-A bathtub moment. Sh--
-[in goofy voice] I got it!

06:27.637 --> 06:29.722
-[Max] You're doing a voice. No.
-[Ethan] I got it.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.266
-Can you hear it? Oh, my God.
-That's, uh...

06:34.018 --> 06:35.937
not a type of writing that I'm...

06:36.020 --> 06:36.854
[clears throat]

06:36.938 --> 06:39.148
...accustomed to, but I am intrigued.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.110
-Thank you. Good adjustment.
-Here is the rub.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.695
-[laughs] Yeah!
-[chuckles]

06:45.988 --> 06:48.366
[cackling]

06:49.242 --> 06:52.328
Him. Um, no, you know, here's the thing.

06:52.411 --> 06:55.456
A 14-year-old girl,
not really ready for the real thing.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.333
She wants a creature to fantasize to.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.127
So for this imprint,

06:59.210 --> 07:02.130
what I'm looking for
is a dream team of monsters.

07:02.213 --> 07:03.673
Creatures of the night.

07:03.756 --> 07:08.845
All the bad boys from all the bad dreams
you've ever had, only the bathtub version.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.888
Right, okay, I got it.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.307
So you're looking for
the monster inside of us.

07:13.391 --> 07:18.062
Yes. And our bodies are hosts and they're
giving us sensual pleasure from within.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.357
Well, no,
I meant like metaphorically speaking.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.694
The monsters are actually
our personal demons.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.612
Demons... Sexy demons.

07:26.696 --> 07:30.658
Sexy demons with defined muscle tone
and then oblique shelf.

07:30.741 --> 07:35.037
No. Just the demons of our childhood
who are crippled emotionally--

07:35.121 --> 07:38.374
-It's boring!
-Just give her a fucking monster.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.711
Baby, I agree, but do the thing...
Do the thing with your, um...

07:43.629 --> 07:46.716
That's a good little bunny.
Okay. Thank you so much.

07:47.216 --> 07:48.342
[whispers] He's a lot!

07:49.343 --> 07:52.930
Um, I... don't know
that this genre is for you.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.932
Oh, no. The genre is for him.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.226
He is a master of the adolescent voice.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.520
We just have to let
all these ideas gestate.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.397
He'll get there. He's very talented.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.317
The thing is, Maxine,
I don't have a second.

08:04.400 --> 08:08.070
Because I'm going to Paris in the morning
and then on safari for a month

08:08.154 --> 08:10.990
because Miss Prisspants over here
wants to see a cheetah.

08:11.073 --> 08:13.159
Cheetahs are so fast!

08:14.410 --> 08:15.453
[mutters] This guy...

08:15.536 --> 08:18.372
Um, I could put something together for you
by the morning.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.334
Great idea.
Why don't we get together for breakfast?

08:21.417 --> 08:25.171
-A breakfast meeting tomorrow.
-7:30 a.m.,<i> </i>Fogo de Chão<i>.</i>

08:25.254 --> 08:28.090
You mean<i> </i>Fogo de Chão,
the Brazilian steakhouse?

08:28.174 --> 08:31.093
The chain of Brazilian churrascarias, yes.

08:31.177 --> 08:34.055
-They'll be open?
-They open when I say they open.

08:34.138 --> 08:36.390
-Oh, wait,<i> </i>Fogo de Chão-Chão<i>?</i>
-Yeah.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.309
Oh, then it's time for a celebration!

08:38.392 --> 08:39.227
[whoops]

08:39.310 --> 08:41.395

-This is normal.

-Ah, Ming Garden!

08:48.569 --> 08:51.113
-Yes, and five episodes of<i> Damages.</i>
-Yes!

Tonight we binge!

08:52.740 --> 08:55.284
Very exciting.
I'm so glad we're finally doing this.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.370
There have been so many conversations
about<i> Damages</i>

08:57.453 --> 09:00.248
-I haven't been able to participate in.
-Recently?

09:01.415 --> 09:02.750
[cell phone rings]

09:02.833 --> 09:06.128
Sorry, babe,
I meant to turn off the ringer here. Oh.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.006
It's Ethan on the phone.
I'm going to take it.

09:09.090 --> 09:12.301
-I just... Real quick.
-Yeah, that's fine.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.262
Hey, dude.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.431
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax! Relax!

09:17.932 --> 09:20.601
Don't freak out. Don't...
It's going to be fine.

09:22.186 --> 09:24.438
Okay. That's a great. Let me ask him.

09:24.814 --> 09:29.068
Uh, babe, Ethan's stressed out
about this deadline we have for tomorrow.

09:29.151 --> 09:32.363
Is it okay if he comes by and just
runs some ideas by me real quick?

09:32.822 --> 09:34.323
Oh, um...

09:35.741 --> 09:36.576
Yeah.

09:36.659 --> 09:37.827
-You sure?
-I'm sure.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.996
I mean, I think we have enough food.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.206
Thank you. He said yes.

09:42.290 --> 09:45.418
-Still gonna watch<i> Damages,</i> right?
-Mm-hmm. So come over now.

09:45.501 --> 09:48.421
Hey! How are you? Oh, my gosh.

09:48.504 --> 09:51.090
-Oh, my God, that's the best idea!
-Wow, that's big.

09:51.173 --> 09:53.926
You know what? I'm sorry.
Can you lift it up? I'm so sorry.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.761
Yeah, I'll stay here.

09:55.845 --> 09:59.056
-Good call on the scuffing of the floor.
-Okay, back.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.601
-You know, they cost a pretty penny.
-Back it up.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.728
-Where do you want it?
-We'll work in here.

10:03.811 --> 10:04.770
Okay. Is this...

10:05.271 --> 10:07.648
-Yeah.
-Gosh, I pushed this thing 20 blocks.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.318
Didn't make any friends.
I'm just out there pushing it and--

10:13.529 --> 10:15.906
I'm sorry,
whatever that food is smells amazing.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.951
-Help yourself! We got plenty!
-Thank you so much.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.453
Thank you so much, babe.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.665
[Ethan and Max laugh hysterically]

10:25.166 --> 10:26.542
What's so funny?

10:27.835 --> 10:31.255
This is actually
one of my favorite places in New York.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.674
The drinks are incredible

10:33.758 --> 10:35.926
and I'm always the youngest girl
in the room.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.429
-Everyone here's like 8,000 years old.
-Right?

10:38.512 --> 10:40.973
That bassist looks like
he's about to keel over.

10:41.807 --> 10:45.519
You know what? I'm getting us drinks.
We all could use some, especially you.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.813
What? I'm fine.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.566
Um, I think you might have some issues
with your new job.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.110
I love my job. It's great.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.445
[soft jazz plays]

10:55.112 --> 10:56.030
[Lisa sighs]

10:56.113 --> 10:58.991
-I hate it. I hate it so much.
-It's terrible.

10:59.075 --> 10:59.950
Marianne!

11:00.034 --> 11:04.080
It's fine. The point is you hate it, so
you shouldn't be there. Life's too short.

11:04.163 --> 11:07.958
I have only been there for a week.
I'm not a quitter.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.002
I leave jobs after one week all the time.

11:10.086 --> 11:13.214
That's called temping.
That's not the same thing as quitting.

11:13.297 --> 11:16.801
Oh, I quit temp jobs all the time.
And I get fired all the time.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.137
Sometimes quitting is a good thing.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.890
Like when you're brilliant
and doing something you hate.

11:22.973 --> 11:26.519
I know, but we need the money.
You know, for stuff and...

11:26.602 --> 11:29.271
-What? What do you need money for?
-It's fine.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.981
I'm not gonna bring this night down.

11:31.065 --> 11:34.151
Let's have drinks and listen to
some jazz and have a good time.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.779
Agreed. What are you drinking?
First round's on me.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.864
What? No. Nobody's paying for anything.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.283
One of us still knows how to be single.

11:42.118 --> 11:45.329
-Oh, God. She flipped the braid.
-She hit me in the face with the braid.

11:45.413 --> 11:49.625
Felix, thank you so much for letting me
come over and interrupt your evening.

11:49.708 --> 11:52.044
-Of course.
-My first three books I'd write by myself.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.087
Every day, 12 hours.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.296
It was amazing.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.841
With this one I feel
I have to be with other people.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.509
I have to have that camaraderie.

11:58.592 --> 11:59.552
Oh!

12:01.720 --> 12:03.514
I'm so sorry. It just happened.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.474
There have been noodles falling.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.518
Would you be more comfortable at a table?

12:07.601 --> 12:10.229
-[Ethan] I don't know. Dracula.
-[Max] Great. Write it down.

12:10.312 --> 12:11.981
And then sexy things are...

12:12.440 --> 12:15.151
-Boobs?
-Boobs. Yeah! Dracula boobs.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.486
Boobs. Dracula boobs. Right, gotcha.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.239
We're going to keep listing stuff
and fill the board.

12:20.322 --> 12:22.783
I gotta tell you,
this is just like the old days.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.368
-Right?
-This is like college.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.411
This is good.

12:25.494 --> 12:30.332
Felix, did I ever tell you that we used to
write together until this guy got famous?

12:30.416 --> 12:32.168
-This guy!
-You did!

12:32.251 --> 12:34.336
[Max] Did I tell you about
the musical we wrote?

12:34.420 --> 12:37.506
-Yes!
<i>-Monica Lewinsky, The Musical.</i>

12:37.590 --> 12:38.716
-[Ethan] My God.
-Yes.

12:38.799 --> 12:42.344
Every student periodical went nuts for us.
Raves.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.889
Do you think it still holds up?
It's topical again.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.765
-No, probably not.

-Yes, we did.
-That is not bad for teenagers.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.930
-And that rap stuff, pre-<i>Hamilton.</i>
-Pre-<i>Hamilton.</i>

13:26.013 --> 13:28.724
I bet someone told
Lin-Manuel Miranda about that.

13:28.807 --> 13:30.601
Must've heard about what we did
and borrowed it.

13:30.684 --> 13:33.771
-Maxie. Much younger than us.
-Much younger?

13:33.854 --> 13:35.231
-[Max] Really?
-He does not know.

13:35.314 --> 13:38.901
Alright, well, I've got to go to bed.
I've got surgery in the morning.

13:38.984 --> 13:42.154
-Good to see you. Good luck.
-Good to see you. Good luck, sir.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.072
Alright.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.865
[Ethan] Good night, Felix.
Have a good one.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.034
-[Felix] Thank you. Good luck.
-Any time.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.452
-Uh-oh.
-Bye. Good night.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.578
What about this?

13:49.662 --> 13:52.498
-What are you gonna do with that?
-I'm about to score on you.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.792
What-what? What? [squeals]

13:54.917 --> 13:56.794
[cheering]

13:56.877 --> 14:00.631
-Poster-ized! That's what we call defense!
-Nice defense.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.675
-7:00 a.m.
-Pardon me?

14:02.758 --> 14:05.052
-I have surgery at 7:00 a.m.
-Oh.

14:05.135 --> 14:06.136
-Right.
-God, I'm sorry.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.889
-It's alright, I'm not sleeping yet.
-That's sweet of you.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.016
But... I'm on my way.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.477
Okay. We will keep it down.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.563
-Have fun.
-Thank you. We will keep it down.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.731
Thank you. Why did I bow?

14:18.566 --> 14:20.192
It's a sign of respect.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.319
-I'm sure he appreciated it.
-Okay.

14:22.403 --> 14:25.614
Yes. Another round
of your most expensive liquor.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.117
-And who wants caviar?
-I do.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.535
Yes!

14:30.327 --> 14:34.456
-So, are you ladies guests of the hotel?
-We're here on business.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.001
Oh. What kind of business?

14:39.295 --> 14:41.714
-[in Russian accent] I am model.
-Is that right?

14:41.797 --> 14:43.799
Tell us a little bit about that.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.051
Tell us everything about your life
and your country.

14:46.135 --> 14:49.638
Yes, I will do. I, um...

14:49.972 --> 14:53.475
I am model. And, um, I am also singer.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.103
We're... singer models.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.688
Singer models. Yes.

14:57.771 --> 15:00.900
Well, if your voices
are as beautiful as your figures,

15:00.983 --> 15:03.152
then we're in a lot of trouble!

15:03.235 --> 15:04.069
[Marianne laughs]

15:04.153 --> 15:05.112
Hey.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.698
Can I have $100?

15:08.324 --> 15:09.366
Uh...

15:10.242 --> 15:12.119
Uh... Sure!

15:12.536 --> 15:15.122
Um... A hundred? Um...

15:15.706 --> 15:17.207
Is two, uh...

15:17.291 --> 15:19.501
two 50s alright?

15:19.585 --> 15:23.047
Thank you! These are wonderful men.

15:23.130 --> 15:25.257
The Americans! America!

15:25.841 --> 15:27.009
-Idea ball.
-Yes!

15:27.092 --> 15:29.136
-Let's just let it flow.
-Evil angel.

15:29.219 --> 15:31.388
-Okay. Maybe a little sexier.
-Yeah, yeah. Um...

15:32.056 --> 15:33.974
Talking about, like, worm. Worm. Worm?

15:34.058 --> 15:36.435
Okay. I haven't seen stuff with worms.
What kind of worm?

15:36.518 --> 15:38.520
A giant worm that sucks your guts out.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.523
-What's sexy about that?
-Because it penetrates your body.

15:41.607 --> 15:45.903
That's not sexy. That's gross. That's like
a tapeworm. You can't fuck a tapeworm.

15:45.986 --> 15:47.571
Okay, Chippendale stripper.

15:47.988 --> 15:51.909
-Uh, okay. What's scary about that?
-His bank account, his life choices.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.410
Have you seen<i> Magic Mike?</i>

15:53.994 --> 15:57.456
-We gotta watch the<i> Magic Mike</i> trailer.
-Ethan, stay focused.

15:57.539 --> 15:59.166
We're going all over the place.

15:59.249 --> 16:02.628
It's just that she wants bathtub moments
and scary monsters.

16:02.711 --> 16:04.296
The two ideas seem to be
fighting each other.

16:04.380 --> 16:07.508
You just take a monster, any monster,
make a girl want to fuck it.

16:07.591 --> 16:10.135
But monsters by definition are not sexy.

16:10.219 --> 16:13.180
Their faces are fucked up,
they don't die, they want to kill you.

16:13.263 --> 16:16.100
How do you jack off to that?
I don't think I can do this.

16:16.183 --> 16:18.143
-I don't think I'm the guy.
-You are the guy.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.895
We just need some market research.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.232
We need to find a teenage girl
and talk to her. Me and you, tonight.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.150
But it can't be weird.
How do we make that not weird?

16:26.151 --> 16:29.071
Nick. Let's call Nick. He dates teenagers.

16:29.154 --> 16:31.615
No, I wouldn't fuck Frankenstein.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.617
What if he's a hodgepodge of sexy parts?

16:33.701 --> 16:36.161
-A bit of Hemsworth, Channing Tatum...
-Yeah.

16:36.245 --> 16:39.832
-Channing Tatum I would fuck.
-Okay. Alright. I think that's helpful.

16:39.915 --> 16:43.544
-Oh, Stephen Colbert I would fuck.
-What?

16:43.627 --> 16:47.798
He's, like, the most normal version
of every part of a person.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.299
Would you do it ironically?

16:49.383 --> 16:52.761
What part of "I would fuck
Stephen Colbert" aren't you getting?

16:52.845 --> 16:55.139
I think you're an outlier
in your demographic.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.433
-Yeah. This is unhelpful.
-That'll help.

16:57.516 --> 17:00.769
-What's this?
-[Nick] Drugs, bro. Adderall.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.022
That stuff got me through finals, so...

17:03.105 --> 17:04.815
-High school, college...
-Mmm.

17:04.898 --> 17:07.693
Orange is Adderall. Blue is Viagra.
Don't take the white.

17:07.776 --> 17:11.530
-Why do you have drugs?
-Why do you not have... not drugs?

17:11.613 --> 17:14.324
It's a Tuesday night, guys.
We're not doing drugs.

17:14.408 --> 17:16.744
Not at my age. Not at our age.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.370
-How many did you just take?
-Three.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.414
-Three drugs?
-That was the third.

17:20.497 --> 17:24.168
Half the kids in America are doing this.
Her five-year-old sister does it.

17:24.251 --> 17:26.003
Five. That's a half-sister or...

17:26.086 --> 17:28.756
You asked for my advice.
This is my advice.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.132
-To do drugs?
-Yes!

17:30.215 --> 17:31.967
It's not gonna make you weird,
just focused.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.635
-There you go!
-Exactly.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.472
-I could use that.
-Just do the drugs!

17:36.555 --> 17:39.975
-Do the drugs! Do the drugs!
-[pop music playing]

17:40.059 --> 17:41.351
Do the drugs!

17:41.435 --> 17:43.437
Warlock! Put it down.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.522
Club kids, they turn into fairies.

17:45.606 --> 17:48.192
-A scarecrow filled with mice?
-Oh, no!

17:48.275 --> 17:50.069
-Super-horny robots.
-Robots.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.029
-Dudes, I got it.
-Yes, man, what?

17:52.112 --> 17:53.530
It's sexy monsters.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.532
No shit.

17:57.951 --> 18:00.662
Oh, man, so what is that,
just chopped up Adderall?

18:01.163 --> 18:02.831
Oh, no, bro, that's cocaine.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.794
Are you fucking serious?
That's cocaine? I did cocaine?

18:07.961 --> 18:11.924
Oh, my God! That's it!
You're so talented, Maxie!

18:12.216 --> 18:15.052
Whoa. Whoa. More.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.553
-Yes.
-[Ethan] That's it, Maxie!

18:16.637 --> 18:19.556
-Why does he have tap shoes?
-Why don't I have tap shoes?

18:20.808 --> 18:21.934
Fifty!

18:24.228 --> 18:25.562
This doesn't make any sense.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.565
[Max] I really thought
we were onto something.

18:28.649 --> 18:29.858
I have an idea.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.236
We have to<i> Beautiful Mind</i> it.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.538
This will not work.
There's no way it's possible.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.207
-I'm putting 20 bucks on 30 seconds.
-Five minutes!

18:45.290 --> 18:47.668
An hour, actually, I think.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.420
-I like that.
-Okay.

18:50.504 --> 18:51.338
Okay.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.426
-[Nick] Stay. Come on. Stay. Stay.
-[Max] Hold. Hold.

18:56.510 --> 18:57.761
[Ethan] Go, go, go.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.974
That's it, though. That's it.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.059
But it's order within the disorder.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.311
Connection into the disconnect...

19:06.395 --> 19:08.021
I wrote vagina seven times.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.106
[Max] 15 more seconds.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.400
-Go! Go! Go! Go!
-Stick! Stick! Stick! Stick!

19:11.483 --> 19:14.403
-No!
-Yes! Wait! Wait! Wait!

19:15.279 --> 19:17.447
I know what we've got to do, you guys.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.161
[Ethan laughs shrilly]

19:22.786 --> 19:24.121
Nick, you're doing it!

19:24.997 --> 19:27.875
-You guys are writing in Sharpie.
-Pretend it's a circle.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.001
I'm sorry, what?

19:29.543 --> 19:31.420
That's Sharpie, permanent marker.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.553
He has no feelings
but he's programmed to fuck.

19:39.636 --> 19:43.390
-And outside he's a person, but--
-I have surgery in the morning, people!

19:43.473 --> 19:44.600
Who the fuck is that?

19:45.851 --> 19:47.352
[all cheer]

19:47.978 --> 19:50.230
-Two minutes!
-Two minutes!

19:50.731 --> 19:52.149
Get out!

19:53.775 --> 19:55.194
-Get out!
-Okay.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.362
All right, uh... Shoes. Shoes. Shoes!

19:57.446 --> 20:00.657
[singing "Lady in Red"]

20:25.515 --> 20:26.350
Really?

20:39.863 --> 20:41.782
-[man groans]
-[music stops]

20:42.491 --> 20:43.325
[Lisa] Jesus!

20:44.618 --> 20:46.828
-Is anybody a doctor?
-I think we should go.

20:47.704 --> 20:51.959
[Max] Okay, so how about a mutant
from a nuclear holocaust? That's cool.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.877
[Ethan] The Holocaust. Interesting.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.421
[Max] Not the Holocaust,
a nuclear holocaust. Come on, man.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.423
[Ethan] I don't know
if I'm cut out for this, okay?

20:58.507 --> 21:00.133
Creatures of the night? What?

21:00.217 --> 21:02.261
Forget the creatures. It's about you.

21:02.344 --> 21:06.223
All the YA genre authors, the good ones,
they write about their own experiences.

21:06.306 --> 21:08.767
-Like Stephenie Meyer, the vampire books.
-Okay.

21:08.850 --> 21:11.687
That's about her life growing up
as a sexually repressed woman.

21:11.770 --> 21:15.023
Right? And, uh, Suzanne Collins, right,
<i>The Hunger Games,</i>

21:15.107 --> 21:17.150
it's about her experiences growing up
as a military brat.

21:17.234 --> 21:20.779
-Wrote about her own experiences.
-L. Ron Howard wanted to start a cult.

21:20.862 --> 21:23.824
-L. Ron Hubbard.
-No, it's 100% L. Ron Howard.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.575
It's 100% L. Ron Hubbard.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.911
It's 100% L. Ron Howard.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.204
A hundred percent.

21:29.621 --> 21:30.706
Nick-- [sighs]

21:30.789 --> 21:34.167
We gotta dig deeper and mine
your own personal experiences, okay?

21:34.251 --> 21:37.713
-You gotta just mine that.
-What you gotta do is break him down.

21:37.796 --> 21:40.340
-You gotta L. Ron Howard him.
-That's not a thing.

21:40.424 --> 21:42.676
That's what L. Ron Howard wrote
in <i>Dianetics.</i>

21:42.759 --> 21:44.469
You use the E-meters to audit him.

21:44.553 --> 21:47.806
Why do you know so much about Scientology
except the guy's name? That's easy!

21:47.889 --> 21:51.852
Did he invent Scientology, like,
after he directed<i> Backdraft</i> and<i> Apollo 13</i>?

21:51.935 --> 21:54.479
No, that was Ron Howard.
I'm talking L. Ron Howard.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.398
-Oh, my God...
-Can we please stop?

21:56.481 --> 21:58.066
-Ethan!
-What?

21:58.150 --> 22:00.277
What kind of creature are you?

22:00.360 --> 22:03.405
-I don't know. A horse?
-Your wife supports you, okay?

22:03.488 --> 22:06.992
She toils every day in drudgery
and you do nothing to support her!

22:07.075 --> 22:09.161
-What creature are you?
-I don't know.

22:09.244 --> 22:12.873
I spend all day looking at boring
apartments, running women's errands

22:12.956 --> 22:14.583
and banging my head against a wall

22:14.666 --> 22:17.336
trying to figure out a genre
that I'm too old to understand!

22:17.419 --> 22:21.798
I am 40 years old! The drawbridge is
going up, man! It's now or never for me!

22:21.882 --> 22:25.052
-What's that make you want to do?
-It makes me want to take charge, scream!

22:25.135 --> 22:26.386
Then give me that scream!

22:26.970 --> 22:29.431
[howls loudly]

22:31.308 --> 22:33.894
Oh, shit. That wasn't a scream.

22:33.977 --> 22:35.854
That was no scream. That was a...

22:35.937 --> 22:37.647
-That was a howl.
-Yeah.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.107
-A howl?
-Are you a wolf?

22:39.191 --> 22:41.359
-Yeah, you're a dog.
-Are you a wolf?

22:41.443 --> 22:43.945
-Let's go with wolf.
-Same family.

22:44.029 --> 22:47.032
-Can you please let me do this!
-I'm part man, part wolf.

22:47.115 --> 22:50.160
-That's what I am.
-That's a werewolf! You're a werewolf!

22:50.243 --> 22:53.330
I am suffocating from the indignities
of humanity by day,

22:53.413 --> 22:57.042
and then when the sun goes down at night,
the beast within emerges!

22:57.125 --> 22:59.336
-Beast mode!
-Yeah!

22:59.419 --> 23:02.214
And I'm roaming all over
and I'm just taking what's mine!

23:02.297 --> 23:04.633
-That's sexy, dude!
-I am a werewolf!

23:04.716 --> 23:06.426
Release the beast!

23:06.510 --> 23:09.221
[howls]

23:10.180 --> 23:12.307
[all howl]

23:14.309 --> 23:15.227
[Lisa] What is this?

23:15.310 --> 23:18.146
Is this a one-piece? Is this attached?

23:18.230 --> 23:20.857
This is a Valentino cape dress.

23:20.941 --> 23:23.735
-[Lisa laughs]
-This is a dress that makes you happy.

23:23.819 --> 23:27.405
-You need one.
-I absolutely do not need a cape dress.

23:27.489 --> 23:29.616
Every lady needs a cape dress.

23:29.699 --> 23:31.827
I'm glad we had this last night together.

23:31.910 --> 23:35.163
-Last night?
-Yeah. Well, last night drinking, anyway.

23:35.831 --> 23:39.626
I start IVF tomorrow, so if that takes,
you know, everything changes.

23:39.709 --> 23:41.294
-What?
-Yeah!

23:41.378 --> 23:44.422
Tomorrow? That...
Why didn't you mention that?

23:44.506 --> 23:48.260
[in Russian accent] It was a fun night.
I did not want to talk of real life.

23:49.177 --> 23:50.512
-So...
-Jesus.

23:51.429 --> 23:55.976
You guys pulled that together
faster than anyone I've ever heard of.

23:56.059 --> 23:59.396
Well, there's no point in moving slowly.
We know what we want.

23:59.479 --> 24:01.648
We've wanted it for a while. So...

24:02.607 --> 24:03.441
Whoa.

24:03.525 --> 24:04.526
Yeah.

24:04.609 --> 24:09.364
So... at the end of the month,
you could be pregnant.

24:10.448 --> 24:12.951
When you put it like that,
it sounds really soon.

24:15.370 --> 24:17.247
-Hey, can I get a drag of that?
-Yeah.

24:17.330 --> 24:20.250
I've got to live it up while I can, right?

24:22.127 --> 24:23.003
Wow.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.504
That's...

24:25.046 --> 24:27.507
big news, Froshy.

24:28.550 --> 24:32.262
Hey, if I become a mom,
will you stop calling me that?

24:32.345 --> 24:34.681
No. Froshy for life.

24:34.764 --> 24:36.016
Fantastic.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.268
Fantastic.

24:49.029 --> 24:50.322
[sighs]

25:02.292 --> 25:07.839
Jasmine is really making an effort to find
a way to cohesively adhere herself...

25:07.923 --> 25:09.174
That would be great, thanks.

25:09.257 --> 25:13.970
So, to adhere herself a little bit more
to Randall.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.847
-What?
-But they both... Shawna?

25:15.931 --> 25:17.849
It's a story about Jasmine and Randall.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.769
Like a Shakespearean love
coming before Neo-Classicism.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.520
Just talk about the book.

25:22.604 --> 25:25.357
So Randal and Jasmine are in love,
but it's unrequited.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.651
So that's the pitch. So...

25:27.734 --> 25:29.819
Yes? Okay. Scatter.

25:30.487 --> 25:33.823
Thank you so much. Now,<i> obrigado,</i> now.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.576
-[Shawna] Thank you so much.
-[Sean] <i>No más</i> meat.

25:38.328 --> 25:41.790
-So the werewolf thing. Love it, perfect.
-Good. Yes.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.000
I need to know more
about the bathtub moments.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.544
-What are bathtub moments?
-[Max] We have those.

25:46.628 --> 25:48.630
We thought a lot about
the bathtub moments.

25:48.713 --> 25:50.131
Shawna, look.

25:53.468 --> 25:54.594
Shawna?

25:55.679 --> 25:57.305
We lost her. She's not...

26:00.475 --> 26:02.143
[Ethan whispers] Shawna?

26:02.227 --> 26:03.061
Sha-na-na-na.

26:03.144 --> 26:07.649
She's decided what the most important
thing at the table is. It's not us.

26:08.817 --> 26:11.278
Excuse me, Shawna? Look.

26:12.904 --> 26:16.074
Bathtub moments are your specialty.
They are who you are.

26:16.950 --> 26:21.204
Uh... They're your truth.
I have a different truth.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.414
[moans with interest]

26:23.373 --> 26:24.833
I am part man...

26:25.667 --> 26:26.668
part wolf.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.046
Humiliated by modern society by day.

26:30.755 --> 26:33.133
But at night, turned loose

26:33.216 --> 26:36.219
and able to do what I want...

26:36.720 --> 26:38.930
when I want.

26:45.353 --> 26:46.813
Oh, I'm still here.

26:48.023 --> 26:48.898
Yeah.

26:54.612 --> 26:56.156
No, here's what it is.

26:56.239 --> 27:00.118
You know when a man turns into a werewolf
and he's covered in hair and gross?

27:00.869 --> 27:04.956
-Instead... he's sexy.
-I like it.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.083
-I like that, too.
-[Sean] Not a lot of hair.

27:07.167 --> 27:10.003
-He's got a smooth back.
-Perfect for fingernail marks.

27:10.086 --> 27:12.464
-That's better than my thing.
-Smooth back.

27:12.547 --> 27:14.007
What is going on here?

27:14.090 --> 27:16.843
Who are these guys
and why is<i> </i>Fogo de Chão open?

27:16.926 --> 27:19.387
-We'll talk about it later.
-[Shawna] It's my<i> </i>Fogo de Chão.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.931
-I'm a franchise owner.
-Three.

27:22.015 --> 27:25.310
-You have three of these?
-So what do you guys think?

27:25.393 --> 27:26.770
-Huh?
-[whispers] Come.

27:26.853 --> 27:28.188
What do you think of this?

27:30.607 --> 27:33.193
The Adderall makes me feel like
I'm falling. I'm...

27:33.276 --> 27:34.903
-Did I tip over?
-No, you're good.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.946
I feel like I'm... Like right there.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.740
-You're alright.
-Do you want a Xanax?

27:38.823 --> 27:40.617
No more pills. No more p--

27:41.826 --> 27:43.953
They're not supposed to make you
afraid of ghosts.

27:45.789 --> 27:46.873
Incredible job.

27:46.956 --> 27:48.541
-Congratulations.
-Thank you!

27:48.625 --> 27:51.169
This is going all the way.
We're taking it to the limit.

27:51.252 --> 27:55.673
We got games, we got costumes,
we're cosplaying it. I love it.

27:55.757 --> 27:59.677
Gauchos! Can we get some to-go
containers? Gonna finish this on the jet.

28:00.261 --> 28:02.013
No. Good Lord...

28:09.104 --> 28:09.938
Good morning.

28:10.855 --> 28:14.192
Oh. You're up. I'm ordering from Zabar's.
How was your night?

28:14.776 --> 28:15.985
Not fun, actually.

28:16.945 --> 28:19.948
I don't have that much in common
with my college friends anymore.

28:20.031 --> 28:23.034
Aww. Well, you can't stay friends
with everyone.

28:23.118 --> 28:25.286
It's sad,
but that's what's supposed to happen.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.455
We have an amazing family.

28:27.539 --> 28:30.500
Yeah, no, I'm still here.
What do you want for breakfast?

28:30.583 --> 28:32.252
Um...

28:33.169 --> 28:35.004
Just send me some of everything.

28:35.088 --> 28:37.006
I'm having a feast for four.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.676
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

28:39.759 --> 28:40.593
[excited laughing]

28:40.677 --> 28:43.304
-[Sam] Good morning!
-[Dash] What's for breakfast?

28:43.388 --> 28:46.349
-Daddy just ordered us a feast!
-[kids gasping]

28:46.433 --> 28:48.727
[chanting] Feast!

28:48.810 --> 28:51.521
Everybody shut up,
I'm trying to give them my credit card!

28:51.604 --> 28:53.690
-Feast!
-Come on!

28:53.773 --> 28:55.358
-Come here!
-There we go.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.444
[slow rock song plays]
