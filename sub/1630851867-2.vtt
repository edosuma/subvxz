Dio that really draws you in?

05:34.625 --> 05:37.128
- Dio is one that I really,
really identify with

05:37.211 --> 05:39.797
because he's had
such a hard life,

05:39.881 --> 05:42.759

Dio's mother did stuff for Dio,

so close with her.

05:57.356 --> 06:01.819
I had a school where I was
getting beat up as a kid.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.696
- But it was a combination
of that and just

06:03.780 --> 06:05.907

he was on the autism spectrum

06:05.990 --> 06:07.241
at that time, so--

06:07.325 --> 06:09.160
- The teachers were bullies
themselves

06:09.243 --> 06:11.370
because they thought
I was the problem child.

06:11.454 --> 06:12.997
Because they didn't know
I had autism.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.582
They thought I just
misbehaved and stuff.

06:14.665 --> 06:16.250

with social struggles

06:16.334 --> 06:17.335

06:17.418 --> 06:18.377

06:18.461 --> 06:20.963
even though I wasn't trying
to misbehave.

06:21.047 --> 06:24.967

- I won't, I won't.

- Hello.

09:47.837 --> 09:51.173

I'm proud, 500 pounds. Okay?

09:51.257 --> 09:53.342
Hi. What's your name?
- Jake.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.387
- I'm Eureka, obviously.
- Brad, nice to meet you.

09:56.470 --> 09:59.223
- Brad, oh, my God.
These men are beautiful.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.183
- Aren't they?
I--I made that one.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.184
- You made this one?
- Yeah.

10:02.268 --> 10:05.563
- Ooh.
So what's up with you all?

10:05.646 --> 10:06.856
Are you excited?
- Yeah.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.734
- Yeah? Nervous?
- I'm so nervous.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.736
'Cause I'm always, like,
caring about, like,

10:11.819 --> 10:14.947
what people think about me
and, like, how I'm perceived.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.240
- Seems like we're gonna
have to pull you

10:16.324 --> 10:17.867
out of your shell a little bit.
- Yeah.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.952
That's what I hope
to get out of this.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.162

to do, like,

10:21.245 --> 10:22.204

I'm not comfortable with,

10:22.288 --> 10:24.040
and it's, like, brought me
out of my shell,

10:24.123 --> 10:26.500
but, like, doing this, like,
that's what I'm excited about.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.419
- Okay, 'cause now
I'm gonna be your drag mama.

10:28.502 --> 10:30.212
- I'm very excited--
- For the show.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.756
You know we call them, like--
do you know about

10:31.839 --> 10:33.591

- No.

10:33.674 --> 10:34.759

I'd ever heard

10:34.842 --> 10:36.552
drag mother, drag family.

10:36.635 --> 10:39.055
- It's basically whoever puts
you in drag for the first time

10:39.138 --> 10:40.389
and, like,
teaches you the ropes

10:40.473 --> 10:42.224

- Oh, okay.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.726
- Are you gonna do drag
with me?

10:43.809 --> 10:44.935
- I'm not.
- Why?

10:45.019 --> 10:47.063
- But I'm gonna be there
to support.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.773
I would rather be a spectator

10:48.856 --> 10:50.566

been to a drag show.

10:50.649 --> 10:52.276

10:52.360 --> 10:54.153
Um, do you all wanna
go outside and chat?

10:54.236 --> 10:55.237
both:
Yeah.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.366

do her thing.

I know that I can tell

11:10.544 --> 11:12.880
that you're very--
I'm just gonna be honest.

you're a little more reserved

11:15.007 --> 11:16.759

- Yeah.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.261
- But I--I would like to know
how difficult it was

11:19.345 --> 11:21.138

in Temecula.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.848

with things

11:22.932 --> 11:24.141

11:24.225 --> 11:25.851
Like, what's life like
in Temecula?

11:25.935 --> 11:28.396
- I mean, like, it's been
pretty rough.

11:28.479 --> 11:32.775

when we first got together,

11:32.858 --> 11:34.944

like, hold my hand in public.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.362
I'm like,
"There's people walking.

11:36.445 --> 11:39.073
Like, no. Like, I don't want--
I don't want them to know."

11:39.156 --> 11:41.033
Like, I know, like,
certain areas, like,

11:41.117 --> 11:42.410
I'm not gonna be affectionate,

11:42.493 --> 11:44.453
and I'm gonna
present straight, you know.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.415
- It just kind of sucks
to have to be as cautious

11:47.498 --> 11:51.127
for, like, someplace
that you call home.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.461
- That's hard.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.172
People shouldn't make you
feel like you have to

11:55.256 --> 11:58.008
apologize for being yourself.
- Yeah.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.802
- It's just the type of thing
where I just don't think,

11:59.885 --> 12:03.973
like, his family is as aware
of how much it hurt him.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.724
- I mean, I think that's where
you want

12:05.808 --> 12:07.435
your mom to show up for you.

12:07.518 --> 12:10.646
- I think it would be awesome
for her to be a part of it

12:10.729 --> 12:12.773

she has a large following

12:28.372 --> 12:30.499
on social media,
and I don't know

12:30.583 --> 12:32.501
if she's scared because
she's like, "People are gonna

12:32.585 --> 12:34.795
"be like, 'Oh, my God,
you're, like, the mom

12:34.879 --> 12:35.921

12:36.005 --> 12:38.382

How can we slightly modify
this stance

29:19.466 --> 29:21.843

but it is James' stance?

- I like that. There we go.

29:23.761 --> 29:24.846

stronger if the hand--

29:24.929 --> 29:26.431
if the palms are out, though.

29:26.514 --> 29:28.600
So this doesn't feel

- Amazing job.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.553
- Ah.

31:31.723 --> 31:34.475
- When Jacob came out to me,
he called me into his room,

31:34.559 --> 31:36.811
and he was like,
"I need to tell you something,"

31:36.894 --> 31:38.980
and I was like--all the things
go through my mind.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.982
I was like,
"Okay, did you do drugs?

31:41.065 --> 31:43.109
"Did you smoke?
You had sex with somebody.

31:43.192 --> 31:46.404
You got a girl pregnant."
And so then he begins to cry.

31:46.487 --> 31:48.072
At one point,
he got on the floor.

31:48.156 --> 31:50.950
He was literally
in the fetal position.

31:51.034 --> 31:53.494
And he was just--every time,
I can't tell the story

31:53.578 --> 31:56.623
without crying
'cause it's so sad.

31:56.706 --> 32:00.710
He was like--it was like
this deep,

32:00.793 --> 32:03.880
in-his-guts wail.

32:03.963 --> 32:05.673
- Yeah.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.885
- And he was just heaving.

32:08.968 --> 32:11.304
And so I'm just asking,
I'm like, "What?"

32:11.387 --> 32:12.889
You know what could be
that horrible?

32:12.972 --> 32:14.932
And finally I just said to him,
"Jake."

32:15.016 --> 32:17.060
I said, "Jake, are you gay?"

32:17.143 --> 32:19.854
And like, he let out
this sound.

32:21.105 --> 32:24.442
And so I knew that's what
he was struggling with.

32:24.525 --> 32:29.155
And so my immediate thing
was him--

32:29.238 --> 32:31.324
no matter what I felt on
the inside,

32:31.407 --> 32:34.327
I didn't want anything to--
I didn't want to look shocked,

32:34.410 --> 32:37.497
sad, scared 'cause I was
so worried about his--

32:37.580 --> 32:40.875
you know, him feeling accepted.

32:40.958 --> 32:43.670
And so I just said,
"Jacob, it doesn't matter."

32:43.753 --> 32:45.755
I was just afraid.
I was afraid.

32:45.838 --> 32:47.048
I didn't want to lose him.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.768

losing him to a community

32:58.851 --> 33:00.561

Not that--

33:00.645 --> 33:02.522

like, I'm you're family.

33:06.025 --> 33:08.194
- I didn't want him
to not be around.

33:08.277 --> 33:10.071
You know what I mean, because
he didn't feel accepted

33:10.154 --> 33:14.117
for who he really, really was.
- That's a fear. I get that.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.035
And the way that you saw him
cry on the floor.

33:16.119 --> 33:18.121
Like, that's a lot of pain
to--to witness.

33:18.204 --> 33:19.580
- And he was a little boy.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.541
- And imagine the moments
that you weren't there.

some sort of--

33:52.238 --> 33:54.615
- Drag?
- Dress up.

- Mm-hmm.

the performance with me
