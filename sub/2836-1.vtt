01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:30.711
The curse began
with your great-great-great grandmother.

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:33.339
Genevieve Katherine Duchannes.

01:11:33.498 --> 01:11:36.877
She had the temerity
to fall in love with a mortal...

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.762
...your ancestor, Ethan Carter Wate.

01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:44.176
In 1864, he deserted.
Came home to his Genevieve.

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:47.520
But he was killed in front of her eyes,
by Union soldiers...

01:11:47.678 --> 01:11:51.057
...who were ransacking Greenbrier
during the battle of Honey Hill.

01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:57.823
And in her madness, in her grief,
she used a spell that is forbidden to us.

01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:59.573
To bring him back to life.

01:12:00.733 --> 01:12:02.827
A spell that left a curse?

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:04.987
No Caster may reverse death.

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:08.954
So she lost her soul,
consumed by darkness forever.

01:12:09.116 --> 01:12:12.245
But the spell worked.
If Genevieve loved him, why'd she kill him?

01:12:12.411 --> 01:12:16.382
In that kind of darkness,
there's not even a memory of love, only power.

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:19.590
Everything has a price.

She lives in the darkness, in the shadows.

If she does appear,
it's in the guise of someone else.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:03.383

I know your true nature, it's strong.

01:13:13.306 --> 01:13:16.810
Sarafine recognizes it too.
She knows that without the curse...

01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:20.230
...your true nature
would claim you for the Light.

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:22.819
No, I believe the curse can be broken.

01:13:23.316 --> 01:13:28.163
But you need to have a will that's so strong
you control your own nature.

01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:31.074
- That's what I told her.
- First thing you do, get rid of him.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.163

I know that no good
can come from us loving a mortal.

another way to break the curse.

01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:15.194
It's feeling scared
and not being able to do anything about it...

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:19.160
...until you don't feel that way anymore,
until you can see your way out of it.
