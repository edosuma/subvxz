00:03.300 --> 00:06.040
[gasp]

00:11.670 --> 00:13.380
No!

00:14.910 --> 00:16.710
Dr. Thunder.

00:17.850 --> 00:19.780
Oh! Oh!

00:19.980 --> 00:21.580
Your power!

00:22.550 --> 00:23.850
It's gone.

00:24.050 --> 00:26.020
[groan]

00:26.360 --> 00:28.990
- How do you feel?
- I'm scared.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.460
Don't you burn out on me.

00:33.960 --> 00:35.630
Light a flame!

00:35.830 --> 00:37.400
I'm trying!

00:39.400 --> 00:41.500
No!

00:43.910 --> 00:46.880
Wow! What a clap, guys!

00:47.080 --> 00:50.550
We are here with the stars
of "Super Society".

00:50.750 --> 00:54.820
Adam Clark and his
girlfriend, Firephina.

00:55.780 --> 01:00.720
Adam, a Golden Globe,
not to mention an Oscar nom.

01:00.920 --> 01:03.930
First I just want to say, I love
this guy. Is he not the best?

01:04.290 --> 01:06.430
- He really is. You are the best.
- You're the best.

01:06.630 --> 01:07.760
- No, you're the best.
- You're the best.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.800
Yes. Yes.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.930
Um... I love the Academy,

01:12.130 --> 01:13.770
almost as much as I love you.

01:13.970 --> 01:16.140
I wanna say something
about this relationship.

01:16.340 --> 01:18.170
I've known you over the years.
You've...

01:18.370 --> 01:19.780
you've dated
a lot of women.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.810
- Right.
- And I see you with her

01:22.010 --> 01:25.680
and I can tell: "This time,
I think it's gonna last".

01:26.950 --> 01:29.650
Love is the great reducer
of ego, Jimmy.

01:31.420 --> 01:32.190
I love you.

01:32.420 --> 01:33.490
[audience sighing] Oh!

01:33.690 --> 01:35.520
[whispering] I love you.

01:36.760 --> 01:37.660
I love her.

01:37.860 --> 01:39.830
[audience sighing] Oh!

01:40.030 --> 01:42.460
- Oh! Sorry!
- Auch!

01:42.670 --> 01:44.430
See? We do our own stunts.

01:44.630 --> 01:47.700
[laughter and clapping]

01:47.900 --> 01:49.170
She's my best friend.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.810
Now, tell me. You are heading
down to Mexico now

01:52.010 --> 01:54.940
to wrap up the trilogy.
Is that bittersweet for you?

01:55.140 --> 01:57.250
Yes, it is.

01:57.680 --> 01:59.080
We actually
have two more scenes

01:59.280 --> 02:02.690
we're filming here in LA.
Unlike these other busy gigs...

02:05.390 --> 02:07.060
[assistant] Another one.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.160
Mr. Clark, set's ready for you!

02:09.360 --> 02:10.260
[knocking the door]

02:10.490 --> 02:11.260
Mr. Clark!

02:11.460 --> 02:12.890
- He came out?
- No.

02:13.100 --> 02:16.100
- I keep knocking but...
- We have to practice our catch.

02:16.700 --> 02:19.740
He's probably doing his
sangha meditation. Cute!

02:19.940 --> 02:23.440
[classical music]

02:27.740 --> 02:29.180
Hey!

02:29.380 --> 02:30.550
Um...

02:30.750 --> 02:32.680
I'm in character so...

02:32.880 --> 02:34.650
This doesn't count,

02:34.850 --> 02:36.490
right?

02:39.520 --> 02:41.420
I found Adam.

02:44.160 --> 02:48.980
[emotional music]

02:49.180 --> 02:51.930
[assistant] Soph...
Sophie...

02:52.700 --> 02:54.700
Are you okay?

02:55.070 --> 02:57.610
Yeah, I'm great!

02:57.810 --> 02:59.480
[puking]

02:59.680 --> 03:01.010
[phone ringing]

03:01.210 --> 03:02.710
[voice machine]
(United Talent Agency.)

03:02.910 --> 03:04.280
(Front desk.)
(Hold for Margo Cohen.)

03:04.550 --> 03:05.880
So, Soph, like...

03:06.080 --> 03:08.720
How does she look?
I mean, how is she doing?

03:08.920 --> 03:11.320
[bells ringing]

03:12.090 --> 03:15.390
Aesthetically, flawless.
Mentally, deranged.

03:15.590 --> 03:17.830
I have to figure out how to tell
the studio about this mess.

03:18.030 --> 03:20.730
[bells ringing]

03:20.930 --> 03:23.800
It's done! She's gonna do the
movie, we're not gonna discuss

03:24.000 --> 03:25.700
the breakup until after
the movie is wrapped.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.070
I've done this a million times.

03:27.270 --> 03:30.070
It's the perfect formula.
Works every single time.

03:30.540 --> 03:33.610
I know there's a lot going on
here, but I need to figure out

03:33.810 --> 03:35.280
what I'm gonna tell the studio.

03:35.480 --> 03:37.550
Really, now?
Read the room.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.820
[bells ringing]

03:41.080 --> 03:43.090
- I have three buts.
- You have three buts.

03:43.290 --> 03:44.820
That's a lot of buts to have.
That's a lot of pressure.

03:45.020 --> 03:46.490
[phone vibrating]

03:46.690 --> 03:48.720
Oh, no, no, no.
I need help. Hurry.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.560
No! Get the phone!
The phone!

03:50.760 --> 03:52.330
Jesus Christ!
Thank you.

03:52.630 --> 03:54.960
Okay, I got it.
Don't try to touch my boob. Hi!

03:55.160 --> 03:58.330
I feel like an idiot.
Of course I did this to myself,

03:58.530 --> 04:00.000
but now my career
is gonna be over.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.270
I'll be on "The Masked Singer"
dressed like up like an octopus.

04:02.470 --> 04:04.910
I mean, cheating?
It's actually very hip.

04:05.110 --> 04:07.080
It's very French, you know?
Why do you think we all go

04:07.280 --> 04:08.940
to the Cannes every year?
For the movies?

04:09.140 --> 04:10.450
Yeah, okay, okay.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.580
The best thing
you can do for her

04:12.780 --> 04:16.590
is forgive yourself and make
sure that this does not get out

04:16.790 --> 04:18.990
before the Oscars.

04:19.190 --> 04:20.360
Oh, my god!
The Oscars!

04:20.620 --> 04:21.660
Lie down.

04:21.860 --> 04:23.290
- Okay.
- I threw up.

04:23.490 --> 04:25.930
Okay. We saw that. You did
such a good job getting it out.

04:26.130 --> 04:28.530
We're finishing the movie
because it's everything

04:28.730 --> 04:30.870
we've ever worked for. But
I don't understand

04:31.070 --> 04:32.670
keeping up appearances
with this hen...

04:32.870 --> 04:35.840
Whether you like or not,
they are more famous together

04:36.040 --> 04:38.410
than they are apart.
I mean, they're a pair!

04:38.640 --> 04:40.810
We'll circle back to that, okay?
I have to deal

04:41.010 --> 04:43.810
with whatever
is happening here.

04:44.010 --> 04:45.950
[music]

04:46.150 --> 04:48.080
[crying]

04:48.980 --> 04:50.620
I'm free!

04:51.290 --> 04:52.290
[shout]

04:53.220 --> 04:58.660
[music]

05:38.670 --> 05:43.170
[lively music]

06:04.960 --> 06:05.960
Good morning.

06:06.160 --> 06:07.360
Good morning.

06:08.760 --> 06:09.630
Coffee?

06:09.830 --> 06:11.230
Yes, please.

06:16.770 --> 06:18.740
Thank you, that's very kind.

06:18.940 --> 06:19.940
You're welcome.

06:20.140 --> 06:22.080
What are you cooking
over there?

06:22.710 --> 06:26.820
The only clinically proven
cure for hangover. Chilaquiles.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.990
Oh! You're appealing
to my wholesome side.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.090
[chuckles]

06:37.290 --> 06:39.900
- For my food blog.
- I'm honored.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.130
- I didn't know you had one.
- You didn't know I have one

06:42.330 --> 06:44.770
because we don't really know
anything about each other.

06:44.970 --> 06:47.900
- We don't, do we?
- Actually, I take that back.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.840
I know you went to Cornell.

06:51.110 --> 06:52.940
I know you can cook.

06:55.280 --> 06:58.210
And that you have no
idea what my name is.

06:59.010 --> 07:02.050
All very useful observations.
Very.

07:02.950 --> 07:04.720
Do you know mine?

07:08.920 --> 07:09.960
No.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.930
[chuckles]

07:12.130 --> 07:13.460
Well...

07:13.660 --> 07:15.130
This international love
affair is skipping romantic.

07:15.330 --> 07:16.830
Not us.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.030
So, um.

07:19.230 --> 07:22.000
I have to go to work. I manage
a hotel a couple of miles away.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.770
Do you want me to order you
an Uber or...

07:23.970 --> 07:26.940
I already got one.
Thank you for breakfast.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.580
By the way...

07:31.950 --> 07:34.780
I like that we don't
know each other's names.

07:35.820 --> 07:37.190
Bye.

07:40.390 --> 07:41.990
You.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.030
[chuckles]

07:53.870 --> 07:56.640
- Really? Again?
- What?

07:56.840 --> 07:58.810
Dude, I don't get you.

07:59.010 --> 08:02.550
The girl stays over,
you make her breakfast.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.810
And at the end you just say,
"Goodbye forever"?

08:05.010 --> 08:06.210
She only stayed for the weekend.

08:06.420 --> 08:08.680
I was making sure her stay
in Playa Mujeres

08:08.880 --> 08:10.620
was really pleasurable.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.310
It's always the tourists.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.160
It's easier that way.

08:16.990 --> 08:18.560
What about a partner?

08:18.760 --> 08:20.160
Someone who improves you
as a person.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.200
That lasts more than hours.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.730
When did you last have
a real relationship?

08:24.930 --> 08:27.040
I've created
the perfect relationship.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.910
Mutually beneficial,
no expectations, symbiotic.

08:31.110 --> 08:32.570
Tourists come and go.

08:32.780 --> 08:35.610
There's a shared understanding
that things can't go further.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.150
It's beautiful!
And with no distractions.

08:38.410 --> 08:41.880
He's such a dick!
Look at that asshole sleeping.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.350
[Adam snoring]

08:44.550 --> 08:46.790
That's why I don't date actors.
They're unstable narcissists

08:46.990 --> 08:50.260
with no perception of reality.
Not you, of course.

08:50.460 --> 08:52.890
Chris, why are we
sharing the car with all this?

08:53.100 --> 08:55.760
You'd have to ask my now
former assistant, Larissa.

08:55.970 --> 08:57.130
[Rachel] She assured me of it
on the phone.

08:57.330 --> 08:59.270
Never trust an adult
with braces.

08:59.470 --> 09:01.940
I've had this recurring
nightmare, all in black and white

09:02.140 --> 09:04.340
where I'm standing
in animal print pajamas,

09:04.540 --> 09:07.330
holding a knife and
about to stab him.

09:07.530 --> 09:10.310
But the guilt stops me. I turn
around suddenly, he gets up,

09:10.510 --> 09:13.320
takes the knife, stabs me
in the back. I bleed out.

09:14.420 --> 09:15.750
And my blood is red.

09:15.950 --> 09:17.920
It's the only part of
the dream that is in color.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.220
We get it.
You've seen "Schindler's List".

09:20.420 --> 09:22.660
- We need a drink.
- Yes, please.

09:22.890 --> 09:25.760
- What are we celebrating?
- The last of the trilogy.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.400
- I'm gonna get bangs!
- No!

09:27.600 --> 09:28.730
- No!
- No bangs.

09:28.930 --> 09:30.170
Remember what happened
to Meredith Cooper?

09:30.370 --> 09:32.530
- Who's Meredith Cooper?
- My point exactly.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.040
It's due to bangs.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.940
[Adam snoring]

09:41.180 --> 09:45.480
[emotional music]

10:07.300 --> 10:10.640
Boss, the suites are ready,
the menus are set.

10:10.840 --> 10:13.110
- The staff is all prepared.
- Come.

10:13.940 --> 10:16.480
[laughter on TV]

10:17.510 --> 10:21.320
I need you to tell me
the status of the artists.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.050
- I'll check.
- Have they arrived?

10:23.950 --> 10:25.620
Antonio, do you copy?

10:26.590 --> 10:28.890
Don't bother, I fired him.

10:29.090 --> 10:30.360
Why?

10:31.560 --> 10:34.600
Rule number one,
don't sleep with guests.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.400
Poor guy.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.370
[Aurelia]
No, he had a great time.

10:40.570 --> 10:43.070
Too bad it cost him
his job.

10:43.340 --> 10:47.140
I need you to handle
the artists

10:47.340 --> 10:49.310
while I get a replacement.

10:49.510 --> 10:51.080
As if.

10:51.310 --> 10:54.080
[Aurelia]
Do I sound like I'm joking?

10:54.380 --> 10:57.550
No way, Aurelia.
I already went through that.

10:57.890 --> 11:00.490
What do you mean by that?

11:00.690 --> 11:04.190
You're asking me
to take a big step back.

11:04.430 --> 11:08.100
What part of your job
don't you get?

11:08.300 --> 11:11.030
We handle everything
in this hotel.

11:11.230 --> 11:13.870
It doesn't matter
how big or small it is.

11:14.070 --> 11:17.070
Or hospitality is something
they didn't teach

11:17.270 --> 11:18.770
in your fancy school?

11:19.210 --> 11:22.380
Do you want me to promote
you to manager

11:22.580 --> 11:24.550
of the New York branch?

11:24.750 --> 11:27.850
I've worked so hard for that.

11:28.350 --> 11:31.420
That damn meritocracy
has damaged you.

11:31.620 --> 11:34.520
No, my love.
You need my recommendation.

11:35.020 --> 11:36.520
And start getting used to it

11:36.730 --> 11:38.530
because in this industry,
you're gonna deal

11:38.730 --> 11:41.360
with Hollywood artists
for the rest of your life.

11:41.560 --> 11:45.300
So you want me to play nanny
for these crazy artists?

11:45.500 --> 11:46.800
Yes.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.040
It's just six weeks.

11:50.040 --> 11:51.410
Well done, Alejandro!

11:51.610 --> 11:53.740
From employee of the month
to babysitter of the year.

11:53.940 --> 11:55.180
Good!

12:09.960 --> 12:15.430
[romantic music]

12:27.780 --> 12:31.180
Oh, Julia!
The towels!

12:35.020 --> 12:37.490
- Okay, first thing I'm doing.
- Yes?

12:37.690 --> 12:40.960
- Phoebe Ranger's up.
- Okay. You are the best.

12:41.660 --> 12:45.430
- I'm taking a shower.
- You have twenty, twenty-five.

12:45.630 --> 12:47.330
You'd better move on.

12:48.760 --> 12:51.230
Okay!

12:52.170 --> 12:54.200
- Oh, wow!
- Hot!

12:54.400 --> 12:56.000
This is heaven.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.040
I've died and gone to it.

12:59.610 --> 13:02.810
My beautiful girlina.
Devil incarnate.

13:04.050 --> 13:08.720
[emotional music]

13:10.050 --> 13:11.890
Oh, my goodness, Alejandro!

13:12.120 --> 13:13.550
Hi, Miss Almas.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.420
You wouldn't mind if I grab
some of these towels, would you?

13:15.620 --> 13:17.090
No, not at all.

13:17.290 --> 13:19.860
Oh. By the way, thank you so much
for sending me the champagne,

13:20.060 --> 13:23.360
the chocolates and the oysters.
They saved my marriage!

13:23.570 --> 13:25.400
You're very welcome.
Have a great rest of your stay.

13:25.600 --> 13:26.770
Thanks.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.150
[Alejandro grunts]

13:29.350 --> 13:30.870
[laughter]

13:31.070 --> 13:32.310
Yes!

13:32.510 --> 13:34.140
[Sophie]Thank you
for always being there for me.

13:34.340 --> 13:35.610
Duh!

13:37.750 --> 13:39.210
- Take a pic.
- Thanks.

13:39.410 --> 13:40.650
I wanna look kind of shy like...

13:40.850 --> 13:42.520
[Sophie] Oh, turn.
Oh, yeah.

13:42.720 --> 13:43.890
But with good tits.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.750
Sorry I cut you off.

13:46.050 --> 13:47.960
These are so cute!

13:48.490 --> 13:50.560
[Rachel] Oh! That is
the vibe here!

13:50.760 --> 13:54.360
[Rachel] Tit out, palm up,
mango energy.

13:54.560 --> 13:57.170
- I'm sad.
- I know but I heard an audio book

13:57.370 --> 13:58.670
that said you have to lean
into that,

13:58.870 --> 14:01.900
like let yourself be sad.
You know, just feel the sadness.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.440
Speaking of... drinks. We need
drinks. I'm getting us drinks.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.540
- No.
- Alcohol fixes everything.

14:06.740 --> 14:10.010
You'll never feel pain again.
I'll be back. I love you!

14:10.210 --> 14:11.350
I love you.

14:14.220 --> 14:19.120
[lively music]

14:33.640 --> 14:36.570
Sophie, it's me, Firephina.

14:36.770 --> 14:39.670
[Firephina] You're hot shit!
Adam Clark...

14:40.480 --> 14:42.510
He's a bad actor.

14:42.740 --> 14:44.410
But you...

14:45.250 --> 14:46.750
You're amazing.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.680
And worthy of love.

14:50.420 --> 14:51.820
I mean that.

14:53.720 --> 14:55.720
Oh! I ran here!

14:55.920 --> 14:57.490
Just give me a minute.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.330
It's good to see you again.

14:59.590 --> 15:01.160
[Aurelia on walkie-talkie]
(Alejandro, make sure)

15:01.360 --> 15:05.000
(to take good care of)
(these artists. Thank you!)

15:05.300 --> 15:06.800
Yes, copy, copy.

15:12.640 --> 15:16.310
[suspense music]

15:17.180 --> 15:19.250
- My god!
- Shit!

15:19.450 --> 15:20.620
Who are you?!

15:20.820 --> 15:22.080
- I'm so sorry!
- Are you trying to take pictures

15:22.280 --> 15:24.450
of my feet saying I'm good
enough for money?

15:25.920 --> 15:29.160
What? No! I'm Alejandro,
the junior manager of the hotel.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.660
You're who?

15:30.860 --> 15:33.160
I was just making sure everything
was okay with your room,

15:33.360 --> 15:34.760
Miss Wilder, and I saw
there were no towels.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.230
There was no one in here
so I...

15:36.430 --> 15:37.970
Oh, my god!
You're a terrible manager!

15:38.170 --> 15:40.300
Actually, I'm not. Like I said,
I didn't realize you'd be here.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.640
Excuse me?

15:41.840 --> 15:43.600
Okay, this is intruding.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.770
How did you not hear
the shower running?

15:45.970 --> 15:49.480
Miss Wilder, I'm... very sorry.
My deepest apologies.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.480
It was my mistake.

15:59.350 --> 16:01.320
[Sophie] Do you...

16:01.520 --> 16:03.760
- Do you have the...?
- Yes.

16:03.960 --> 16:07.660
[shower running]

16:10.330 --> 16:12.630
- I'm leaving now!
- Good.

16:12.970 --> 16:14.500
[Aurelia on walkie-talkie]
(Don't forget to deliver)

16:14.700 --> 16:17.310
(Sophie Wilder's)
(welcome gift to her suite.)

16:17.510 --> 16:19.070
I'm not in my walkie, Mom.

16:19.340 --> 16:21.580
Sorry. I'm just gonna...

16:21.780 --> 16:24.950
grab my walkie. I'm really sorry
about the towels.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.920
[Rachel] Honey, I'm home!
Oh!

16:31.020 --> 16:33.590
- Hi.
- I'm Rachel, I'm a Virgo.

16:33.790 --> 16:36.660
And I'm 5'7",
which is kind of tall for a girl.

16:36.860 --> 16:38.960
Margarita time!

16:39.890 --> 16:43.330
Well, if you need anything
from, you know,

16:43.530 --> 16:47.600
you can just call the front desk
and we'll assist you right away.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.340
I'm sure you would be.
Thank you so much.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.040
Have a great stay.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.880
Gay?

17:02.620 --> 17:06.550
[instrumental music]

17:06.760 --> 17:08.520
[maid] Thanks, Alejandro.
I forgot the towels.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.230
[Alejandro] It's okay.
Don't worry.

17:10.430 --> 17:13.560
I must confess
I was head over heels.

17:14.030 --> 17:18.600
Adam Clark, my God!
That man is...!

17:18.800 --> 17:21.140
He looks better in person.
And he's so tall!

17:21.370 --> 17:23.600
On the internet it says
he's 5'97" tall,

17:23.810 --> 17:26.790
but I think he's like 6'06".

17:26.990 --> 17:29.480
I don't know if you
noticed, Tachi,

17:29.680 --> 17:31.450
but Adam Clark

17:32.510 --> 17:35.250
touched my hand.
He loves me!

17:35.450 --> 17:36.780
- I saw it.
- Right? He loves me.

17:36.990 --> 17:39.790
Okay, come on.
He was just tipping you.

17:39.990 --> 17:43.160
- Good gossip.
- It was just a tip.

17:43.390 --> 17:46.830
- You'll love this story.
- Spill it.

17:47.030 --> 17:50.100
I was doing my job, making
sure their rooms were perfect.

17:50.300 --> 17:54.400
Then, I saw her... and I repeat,
I was doing my job.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.400
And she entered... naked.

17:56.610 --> 17:59.570
You saw Sophie Wilder,
Firephina, naked?

17:59.770 --> 18:01.140
She went crazy!

18:01.340 --> 18:04.110
She's a goddamn crazy actress!
Nuts. A prima donna.

18:05.450 --> 18:06.650
Was I rude earlier?

18:06.850 --> 18:08.020
To the guy?

18:08.220 --> 18:10.820
No! Oh, my god. He walked on you
completely naked.

18:11.020 --> 18:13.420
If anything,
you are alarmingly civil.

18:13.620 --> 18:15.620
Well, you didn't hear me.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.630
She has a little bit of a crush,
doesn't she?

18:18.830 --> 18:22.500
I love single you!
Oh my god! This is perfect.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.800
A fun little fling.
The first.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.300
You know, I see this with
so much love in my heart

18:27.500 --> 18:28.940
but I've been waiting
for this moment for years.

18:29.140 --> 18:30.870
It is time.
You're free.

18:31.070 --> 18:32.810
And if you're not gonna do it,

18:33.010 --> 18:34.310
I'm gonna draft it.

18:34.510 --> 18:35.880
I'm gonna draft the notes
of the breakup post.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.650
Okay, but this is my life,
not an attempt to go viral.

18:38.850 --> 18:42.150
Sophie!
I have incredible news!

18:42.880 --> 18:45.520
He cheated on you.
Please, the world needs to know.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.160
This guy's a monster.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.620
He once told me he didn't think
girls should go to school.

18:49.820 --> 18:51.330
You wanna tell everybody
he cheated on me?

18:51.530 --> 18:52.630
No!
Absolutely not.

18:52.830 --> 18:55.430
Hey, you. I got this.
I got this one.

18:55.630 --> 18:56.800
Okay. What would Meryl do?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.370
Meryl would put a pin
in all of this

18:59.570 --> 19:01.640
and she would raise
a glass of

19:01.840 --> 19:04.910
[Chris] "Sophie's choice":
Moet et Chandon.

19:05.110 --> 19:06.970
- Don't mind if I do.
- Am I right?

19:07.180 --> 19:10.650
And she would celebrate

19:10.850 --> 19:14.180
the script that
I just got for you.

19:15.820 --> 19:16.980
What is it?

19:17.190 --> 19:21.720
I got you
"New York or Nowhere".

19:23.660 --> 19:24.660
Shut up!

19:24.860 --> 19:25.990
She got the offer?

19:26.190 --> 19:29.000
Well, we got an offer
for a meeting

19:29.200 --> 19:31.230
and a tape.

19:31.430 --> 19:32.630
[Chris] Which is similar.

19:32.830 --> 19:34.670
- Sophie Wilder does not tape.
- I can tape.

19:34.870 --> 19:38.540
Sophie Wilder is fine with the
tape, so is "Emily from Paris"

19:38.740 --> 19:40.780
and Sarah Sherona and...

19:40.980 --> 19:42.710
You do the accent
when you say her name.

19:42.910 --> 19:44.010
[Chris] And she's Irish.

19:44.210 --> 19:45.850
[Chris]
They're all submitting a tape.

19:46.050 --> 19:48.280
I don't book tapes

19:48.580 --> 19:50.520
that I don't do with Adam.

19:50.720 --> 19:53.520
Oh, the way this man
has brainwashed you, babe!

19:53.720 --> 19:55.060
[Chris] -What year is this?
[Rachel] -You haven't stopped

19:55.260 --> 19:56.590
talking about him
for a single second, please!

19:56.790 --> 19:58.260
It was a five-year relationship!

19:58.460 --> 20:00.700
Oh! No, no, no!
Margo Cohen, I cannot take it.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.860
If I wanna be topped, I'm doing
Grindr, thank you. It's all you.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.900
Okay, wow. Thanks.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.900
- Go, girl!
- She's not that scary.

20:08.100 --> 20:09.770
Girl-boss!

20:10.040 --> 20:11.440
- It's my girl-boss.
- Hi!

20:11.640 --> 20:13.070
- Hi, Margo!
- Too nice.

20:13.270 --> 20:15.310
She sounds like a little baby
when she answers the phone.

20:15.540 --> 20:16.940
[girlish voice]
I need a diaper.

20:17.150 --> 20:18.750
[girlish voice]
I'm a little school girl.

20:18.950 --> 20:20.480
I order the same way
in a restaurant.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.420
[girlish voice]
Could I have a soufflé?

20:22.620 --> 20:24.820
[Margo] (Tell Rachel)
(to not post anything, okay?)

20:25.020 --> 20:26.720
- How did you...?
[Margo] (-We're just thinking)

20:26.920 --> 20:29.060
the best thing you can do for you
right now

20:29.260 --> 20:31.060
is to say absolutely nothing
about the break up

20:31.260 --> 20:33.630
(until this movie and possibly)
(the spin-off sequel)

20:33.830 --> 20:35.800
are in the can.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.570
- [Margo] (-Okay? We good?)
- Okay, uh...

20:38.830 --> 20:42.540
Does that really align with our
values as women in this industry?

20:42.740 --> 20:44.170
I mean...

20:45.570 --> 20:47.210
I feel trapped.

20:47.740 --> 20:49.980
You feel trapped.
Okay, well...

20:50.180 --> 20:54.080
You know? This industry just...
quick reminder, was built

20:54.280 --> 20:57.120
on the back of a five year-old
child named Shirley Temple,

20:57.320 --> 21:00.360
who they made wear miniskirts
and dance on a grown man's lap.

21:00.590 --> 21:01.990
Not a mother in sight, so...

21:02.190 --> 21:03.790
(Look, time's up.)

21:03.990 --> 21:07.500
(But every time a guy)
(like Adam Clark breaks up)

21:07.700 --> 21:09.060
(with a girl like Sophie Wilder)

21:09.260 --> 21:10.700
you are the one

21:10.900 --> 21:12.930
to get the short end
of the stick. It's you.

21:13.130 --> 21:14.700
I'm not talking about his stick.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.440
I don't know if it's
short or not.

21:16.640 --> 21:18.840
I didn't look at the nudes.
I just made them go away.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.940
Well, we can change
the narrative.

21:21.140 --> 21:22.810
[Margo on the phone]
(Go on a journey with me, honey.)

21:23.010 --> 21:24.810
(Remember, uh, Tom and Katy?)

21:25.010 --> 21:27.380
(Yeah, exactly. Where did she go?)

21:27.650 --> 21:29.780
(And then there was Ben and Jen.)

21:29.980 --> 21:32.850
Brad and Jen, but Ben and Jen...

21:33.050 --> 21:34.460
Aniston, not Lopez.

21:34.660 --> 21:37.120
(The point is, all that)
(incredible work you've done...)

21:37.330 --> 21:41.130
(Do you really want it to be)
(eclipsed by some guy?)

21:41.660 --> 21:45.270
(Sophie, do you really)
(wanna be treated like)

21:45.630 --> 21:48.000
just another Jen?

21:49.740 --> 21:53.270
[emotional music]

21:53.640 --> 21:55.810
- I don't.
[Margo] (-Smart. Brilliant.)

21:56.010 --> 21:57.780
(I underestimated you.)

21:57.980 --> 21:59.980
You have a business brain.

22:00.180 --> 22:02.150
[Margo on the phone]
(Okay, we'll talk soon!)

22:04.850 --> 22:08.960
[emotional music]

22:12.960 --> 22:15.830
[Dr. Thunder] Don't worry,
I brushed my teeth after lunch.

22:16.030 --> 22:17.650
I didn't.

22:17.850 --> 22:19.030
Okay.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.840
[man] Okay, rolling.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.170
Silence!

22:24.370 --> 22:25.740
[director] Action!

22:30.680 --> 22:33.310
[loud kissing]

22:38.290 --> 22:40.860
Okay, let's cut!
Come with me!

22:41.060 --> 22:42.120
Right! Cut!

22:42.890 --> 22:46.890
[lively music]

22:49.900 --> 22:52.200
Soph, dear, I think your kiss
ain't working for me.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.800
- Yeah.
- You know what I think?

22:54.000 --> 22:56.870
I think you wake up first,
you realize where you are.

22:57.070 --> 22:58.440
First punch, then kiss.

22:58.640 --> 22:59.470
Set.

22:59.710 --> 23:01.040
Full, full.

23:01.240 --> 23:04.080
There's a bottle of water there.
Okay, let's go folks!

23:15.920 --> 23:17.430
Action!

23:24.430 --> 23:26.430
That's for almost dying.

23:28.240 --> 23:33.140
And that's for saving the world.
Now, where the hell are we?

23:35.080 --> 23:39.250
And cut! That was beautiful!
Thank you, Soph.

23:39.450 --> 23:41.450
The studio says
hers is too freezy.

23:41.650 --> 23:43.020
No, she's perfect.

23:43.320 --> 23:44.950
All right, I think we have it.

23:45.150 --> 23:47.150
Hey, Margo,
I wanted to close the...

23:47.360 --> 23:48.190
Excuse me!

23:48.390 --> 23:50.190
No, thank you!

23:50.690 --> 23:54.260
Anyway, circling back,
no, no circle in black.

23:54.760 --> 23:59.630
Margo, I just bought some SPF 50
which made me think of you, uh...

23:59.830 --> 24:03.970
No. Hey! Margo, they are all
checked in separate rooms

24:04.170 --> 24:07.210
on opposite ends of the hotel.
They' re now on the same set.

24:07.410 --> 24:08.910
Say a prayer.

24:09.310 --> 24:10.710
- Hey!
- Hi.

24:10.910 --> 24:14.110
There's some lavender in there,
you know, for the stress.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.120
How could you tell
I was stressed?

24:16.320 --> 24:18.350
Is it because
I yelled at the child?

24:21.190 --> 24:23.090
You know, you're on vacation!

24:23.290 --> 24:25.490
You should relax a little.

24:25.990 --> 24:28.200
I am here doing damage control

24:28.400 --> 24:30.160
and then I have to
head back to LA

24:30.360 --> 24:33.200
in six hours to meet
with Avril Lavigne's team

24:33.400 --> 24:35.300
about the skater board bio pic.

24:36.470 --> 24:38.120
I love her.

24:38.320 --> 24:42.410
I do too. She's actually
a client of mine.

24:42.710 --> 24:44.210
Is she nice?

24:45.980 --> 24:47.010
Uh?

24:47.220 --> 24:48.920
Kind of complicated, isn't it?

24:49.120 --> 24:50.720
[laughter]

24:50.920 --> 24:52.520
So you're Taki.

24:53.150 --> 24:54.120
Um...

24:54.320 --> 24:55.690
Tachi.

24:55.890 --> 24:57.460
Tachi.

24:57.890 --> 25:00.560
The pleasure is mine, Tachi.

25:00.830 --> 25:05.970
I love your cock... tails.

25:06.270 --> 25:07.900
Oh, thank you.

25:10.740 --> 25:14.170
Every time I feel like
they might know me it's either:

25:14.380 --> 25:17.180
Oh my god! It's Firephina!

25:17.380 --> 25:20.010
Or worst,
it's Adam Clark's girlfriend!

25:20.210 --> 25:22.220
[man on the phone] (Sophie,
plenty) (of people know you are)

25:22.420 --> 25:24.950
(separate from your relationship)
(with Adam Clark, okay?)

25:25.150 --> 25:28.840
(Okay, dear, it's been a long day.)
(You sound hungry. Get a snack.)

25:29.040 --> 25:31.560
(I'll send you that tape)
(from "New York or Nowhere")

25:31.760 --> 25:34.260
(unless you wanna act in spandex)
(for the rest of your life.)

25:35.560 --> 25:39.130
Oh, right the strike of midnight,
Pancho.

25:39.470 --> 25:42.870
Yes, otherwise I will be
turning into a pumpkin.

25:46.770 --> 25:49.810
Here's the derby food
and that's the bar.

25:50.010 --> 25:52.080
Good night, guys. I'll...

25:52.850 --> 25:53.950
see you tomorrow.

25:54.150 --> 25:55.950
Miss Wilder, late night?

25:56.150 --> 25:58.220
Double of the time, but we got
the shots we needed.

25:58.420 --> 25:59.890
Didn't know you played
basketball.

26:00.090 --> 26:01.360
I don't.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.930
Oh, I see the confusion.
Is there a late night menu?

26:05.130 --> 26:06.860
Yeah, I'll go grab one.

26:08.900 --> 26:11.430
Hey, Soph, um...

26:12.070 --> 26:14.840
I thought you did wonderfully
today, but

26:15.040 --> 26:19.140
never feel like you have to rush
through your text. I mean,

26:19.340 --> 26:20.910
we're the stars.

26:21.110 --> 26:22.780
We run the set. Right?

26:22.980 --> 26:25.850
Okay, if you're talking about
scene 36,

26:26.050 --> 26:27.350
[chuckles]

26:27.550 --> 26:30.350
I thought we got it
and I was giving the director

26:30.550 --> 26:32.290
the time she needed
for the stunts.

26:32.490 --> 26:35.020
We'll see. Tape never lies.

26:36.190 --> 26:39.330
Oh, my God! Captain Thunder?!

26:39.960 --> 26:44.630
You're the actress! Fire...
Uh... Fire...

26:44.830 --> 26:47.800
I can't handle fans at this
hour. Good night. I can't.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.440
I love all the sequels
to "Secret Society".

26:49.640 --> 26:51.270
- Guys, could we...?
- "Super Society".

26:51.470 --> 26:53.440
No, please, I'm so sorry.
I'm so tired.

26:53.640 --> 26:55.180
Excuse me, bitch?

26:55.380 --> 26:57.710
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Sir, you can't do that.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.280
I'm a guest!

26:59.510 --> 27:00.680
No, you're drunk and you're
getting back to your room.

27:00.880 --> 27:01.880
- Martin, take him to his room.
- Let's go.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.050
She's famous, you know?

27:04.390 --> 27:06.990
I'm telling drunken gringos
to get back to their room.

27:07.190 --> 27:09.360
Curse of the job.
Here, Miss Wilder.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.060
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

27:11.260 --> 27:13.130
Oh, is this all you have?

27:13.630 --> 27:16.530
Uh, our kitchens are closed.
So sorry.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.430
How disappointing!

27:19.970 --> 27:23.470
I guess I'll just starve
'till the sun rises.

27:25.010 --> 27:26.970
Good evening, Miss Wilder.

27:30.310 --> 27:31.910
What a night!

27:35.220 --> 27:40.590
[music]

27:55.500 --> 27:57.170
[Alejandro]
Miss Wilder?

27:57.370 --> 27:58.410
What are doing?

27:58.610 --> 28:01.210
Oh! Thank God!
I hate cooking.

28:02.210 --> 28:04.350
Can you help a gal in need?

28:08.050 --> 28:09.720
That looks like trouble.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.620
It's a sandwich.

28:12.450 --> 28:15.520
So, you and Mr. Clarke
are shooting a movie.

28:16.960 --> 28:20.430
Yeah, the third of
the "Super Society" trilogy.

28:25.700 --> 28:28.300
You've never seen
"Super Society", have you?

28:29.570 --> 28:31.140
Sorry.

28:33.410 --> 28:36.040
Don't be. They're silly.

28:36.240 --> 28:38.950
And according to Scorsese,
not cinema.

28:39.150 --> 28:40.650
Well, what does he know?

28:45.050 --> 28:46.450
Happy?

28:48.420 --> 28:50.090
Thank you.

28:50.560 --> 28:52.290
You're welcome.

28:59.130 --> 29:00.770
But...

29:01.000 --> 29:03.320
You're very hospitable.

29:03.520 --> 29:05.110
Thank you.

29:05.310 --> 29:07.510
Ever since my dad left, I felt
responsible for taking care

29:07.710 --> 29:11.410
of my mom and sister, so
hospitality was a natural fit.

29:13.050 --> 29:16.150
I once invited my Postmates
driver in for Thanksgiving dinner

29:16.350 --> 29:19.070
that he had just delivered.

29:19.270 --> 29:21.560
Wow!
So you do really hate cooking.

29:21.760 --> 29:22.890
Yeah.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.430
How it takes longer
than it does to eat it.

29:27.430 --> 29:29.500
Did you, um...
did you always work here?

29:29.700 --> 29:33.130
Yeah, I was actually born
and raised in this hotel.

29:33.430 --> 29:35.270
Like Eloise.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.640
I work here now

29:38.270 --> 29:40.510
and I'm headed to New York.
I'm part of the rotation program

29:40.710 --> 29:44.510
for the hotel where, hopefully,
I'll be able to manage there.

29:45.410 --> 29:47.280
He says with disdain.

29:47.480 --> 29:49.020
Because I wanna open
my own place,

29:49.220 --> 29:52.290
but a boutique hotel. A place
that's cozier and smaller

29:52.490 --> 29:55.360
where people from all over the
world can come and feel at home.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.190
Please, tell me more.

29:57.390 --> 29:59.830
How do I put it? Like...

30:00.030 --> 30:03.600
When you're making coffee and
you choose your favorite mug,

30:03.800 --> 30:05.370
right?

30:05.570 --> 30:08.640
But you leave it out,
forget about it.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.470
It's cold, it's very sad.
In my hotel,

30:11.670 --> 30:14.470
we'd make sure that coffee mug
is always warm.

30:14.680 --> 30:18.380
[romantic music]

30:18.580 --> 30:21.750
- You've thought about that a lot.
- Yes, I have.

30:22.050 --> 30:23.580
And in the meantime,

30:23.780 --> 30:27.250
I get to take care of wonderful
hotel guests like yourself,

30:27.460 --> 30:28.590
Miss Wilder.

30:28.790 --> 30:31.490
Call me, Sophie.
You have seen me naked.

30:31.690 --> 30:33.230
I wasn't looking.

30:33.430 --> 30:35.160
Well now I'm offended.

30:41.070 --> 30:45.870
[romantic music]

30:47.410 --> 30:50.580
- Uf!
- Oh, no! No! No! No! No!

30:50.780 --> 30:52.950
I... I shouldn't even had that.

30:53.180 --> 30:55.920
You're not missing out on
my grandmother's secret recipe.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.550
It's not happening.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.420
Spoon me.

31:13.470 --> 31:15.900
- I know.
- It's so unfair!

31:19.810 --> 31:23.540
If I ever meet your grandmother,
I'm giving her a huge hug.

31:34.760 --> 31:37.790
Do you know how to get back to
your room from here, Miss Wilder?

31:41.400 --> 31:43.160
No.

31:44.830 --> 31:46.630
Good night.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.240
Hi, mom!

31:58.780 --> 32:01.020
I miss you too.

32:01.280 --> 32:04.420
But I'll see you at
Dani's birthday next week.

32:08.660 --> 32:10.560
Yes, mom.

32:10.820 --> 32:13.590
Love you.
Kisses.

32:17.830 --> 32:20.330
Let's check this out.

(-How elementary.)
(-It certainly is elementary.)

(Oh, no!)

32:45.990 --> 32:47.450
(No!)

(O2!)

[suspense emotional music]

32:59.810 --> 33:01.640
[screams excited]

33:05.680 --> 33:07.450
What is it, boss?

33:07.880 --> 33:09.350
What are you doing here?

33:09.550 --> 33:11.390
I was passing by.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.420
And I remembered our
conversation yesterday.

33:13.620 --> 33:16.220
- So I came to help.
- Good timing.

33:16.420 --> 33:19.760
Miss Sophie has just called
asking for you.

33:21.600 --> 33:25.530
Since when are you so excited
by your guest relations role?

33:26.270 --> 33:27.670
Not at all.

33:27.870 --> 33:29.370
What did she want?

33:30.500 --> 33:31.770
[Rachel] Hello!

33:31.970 --> 33:34.510
Hi, uh... I was told Miss Wilder
needs some towels.

33:34.710 --> 33:37.780
Towels, that's hilarious.
You know, you can just ask

33:37.980 --> 33:40.850
for her number. I' m joking.
Come down, come inside.

33:41.050 --> 33:43.580
Let's go. Sophie! Soph!

33:43.780 --> 33:44.820
[Sophie] Who is it?

33:45.020 --> 33:47.120
- Oh God.
[Sophie] -Is that Adam?

33:47.520 --> 33:50.690
No. It's the cute guy
who saw you naked.

33:50.890 --> 33:52.630
By the...
I did not see her naked.

33:52.830 --> 33:53.760
Yeah, now I've heard everything.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.400
[chuckles]

33:55.600 --> 33:57.420
I thought it was your day off.

33:57.610 --> 34:01.030
Uh, yeah, it was. I was called
in for a last minute meeting

34:01.270 --> 34:03.450
for a committee
that I oversee and, uh,

34:03.650 --> 34:05.570
I'm an overachiever.

34:06.540 --> 34:08.340
Well it's good to see you.

34:08.540 --> 34:10.810
It's good to see you. Too.

34:13.750 --> 34:14.580
Hey!

34:14.780 --> 34:16.350
Huh! Doctor Thunder?

34:17.380 --> 34:19.390
I mean, Mister Clark.

34:19.590 --> 34:21.820
My God! It looks like
we got a fan here!

34:22.020 --> 34:24.820
You want a selfie? I'll give you
one in a minute, okay?

34:25.030 --> 34:27.060
Wow! Look at me!

34:27.560 --> 34:29.500
Who's this handsome devil?

34:30.560 --> 34:31.900
Check me out.

34:32.930 --> 34:34.740
[chuckles]

34:37.300 --> 34:38.640
Good evening, Miss Wilder.

34:38.840 --> 34:40.140
Are you in need
of more of these?

34:40.340 --> 34:41.440
Because this morning I did
your room and I thought

34:41.640 --> 34:43.810
I had changed them all,
but... [chuckles]

34:45.210 --> 34:48.320
If I made a mistake,
I apologize. I'm sorry.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.850
No. No, you didn't.
You didn't make a mistake. I

34:51.050 --> 34:54.420
ordered a lot of towels.

34:56.660 --> 35:01.460
You've inspired me.
From one apology to another.

35:04.930 --> 35:08.140
I'm so sorry.
Yesterday on the set,

35:08.840 --> 35:11.940
I was transfixed by the words

35:12.140 --> 35:15.380
and I failed to be
your equal scene partner.

35:15.580 --> 35:18.710
I really miss you.
Are you listening?

35:21.820 --> 35:23.720
Banquets, do you copy?
Are the centerpieces

35:23.920 --> 35:25.620
and tablecloths ready
for the event?

35:25.850 --> 35:27.490
[man on speaker]
(Yes, sir. Everything's ready.)

35:27.690 --> 35:29.590
Great. I'm on my way,
thank you.

35:30.720 --> 35:31.790
Hi!

35:31.990 --> 35:33.360
Hi, Miss Wilder!

35:33.560 --> 35:35.160
[birds chirping]

35:35.400 --> 35:40.330
It's so beautiful here. I was
wondering, can I take a tour?

35:40.530 --> 35:43.540
Yeah, of course. I'd be happy
to assist you with that.

35:43.740 --> 35:46.110
- It would have to be private.
- Of course.

35:46.370 --> 35:48.310
Where would you like to go?
You can go

35:48.510 --> 35:50.110
scuba diving or

35:50.410 --> 35:52.880
go visit cenotes,
which are actually my favorite.

35:53.080 --> 35:54.650
They're amazing.

35:54.850 --> 35:59.520
- Or Mayan ruins perhaps?
- Actually I'd like to go dancing.

35:59.850 --> 36:00.990
Dancing?

36:01.190 --> 36:03.190
- Good afternoon.
- Hi, how are you?

36:04.160 --> 36:06.130
When would you like to go?

36:06.760 --> 36:08.260
Tomorrow?

36:08.460 --> 36:11.770
Okay, is there a particular style
you and Mr. Clark would like?

36:11.970 --> 36:13.470
Oh, it's just me.

36:13.670 --> 36:15.400
And...

36:15.600 --> 36:17.100
Tango.

36:19.870 --> 36:21.440

36:24.750 --> 36:26.650

- Good.

Well, welcome to Isla Mujeres.

37:09.490 --> 37:10.960
[Alejandro VO] (What are you?)
(A tour guide?)

37:11.160 --> 37:14.330
(That's exactly what you are)
(doing! Do your job, Alejandro.)

37:14.560 --> 37:15.800
[Sophie VO]
(Ask him a question.)

37:16.000 --> 37:18.800
Is this where you want
to open up your hotel?

37:19.570 --> 37:21.370
[Alejandro VO] (My God!)
(She remembered!)

37:21.600 --> 37:24.570
No. Uh, I mean,
it's beautiful here but...

37:24.770 --> 37:26.670
I was looking at places
in San Miguel de Allende.

37:26.870 --> 37:27.940
[Sophia VO] (That was)
(a horrible question.)

37:28.140 --> 37:29.510
(What am I even doing here?)

37:29.710 --> 37:30.740
Oh! That's...

37:30.940 --> 37:32.680
That's where my grandmother
was born.

37:32.880 --> 37:34.580
- No way!
- Yeah. Yeah.

37:34.780 --> 37:35.980
I heard it's beautiful.

37:36.180 --> 37:37.580
- You've never been?
- No.

37:37.790 --> 37:39.150
[Sophia VO] (Oh, perfect,)
(an audience.)

37:39.350 --> 37:40.920
(Watch how you get blamed)
(for cheating on Adam now.)

37:41.120 --> 37:43.660
(But, you know what, Sophie?)
(Allow yourself to have fun.)

37:43.860 --> 37:45.790
Two Pacificos, please!

37:45.990 --> 37:47.790
[Alejandro VO]
(Be a gentleman.)

37:47.990 --> 37:50.830
[Alejandro VO]
(Oh, my god, she's beautiful.)

37:52.800 --> 37:54.170
Thank you.

37:54.370 --> 37:56.700
[Sophia VO] (He's more)
(of a romantic than I imagined.)

37:57.100 --> 37:58.570
Cheers.

37:59.240 --> 38:00.770
Cheers.

38:00.970 --> 38:02.610
[Sophia VO] (God, he's cute. I)
(wonder if he's as nervous as me.)

38:02.810 --> 38:06.210
[Alejandro VO] (This isn't a
date.) (It's just a private
tour.)

38:06.710 --> 38:08.150
(At midnight.)

38:08.350 --> 38:10.050
[Sophia VO] (Ask me)
(to dance, you fool.)

38:10.250 --> 38:12.690
[Alejandro VO] (Just ask her
to...)

38:12.890 --> 38:14.090
Shall we dance?

38:15.820 --> 38:18.490
I should warn you.
I'm a fantastic dancer.

38:18.690 --> 38:20.330
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

38:21.630 --> 38:22.730
Okay.

38:22.930 --> 38:25.930
[music]

38:26.830 --> 38:30.040
Oh. I thought you'd be

38:30.240 --> 38:32.510
a little better at dancing.

38:32.710 --> 38:35.280
- That was all you.
- Oh, really?

38:46.690 --> 38:51.160
[drums]

38:52.760 --> 38:58.370
[modern tango music]

40:10.270 --> 40:13.840
Thank you. I haven't had
that much fun in a while.

40:14.040 --> 40:15.840
I mean, that was...

40:16.040 --> 40:17.440
Hot?

40:19.780 --> 40:22.120
Aren't you and Adam...
I mean I'm...

40:22.920 --> 40:27.350
[romantic music]

40:33.430 --> 40:35.730
Good night, Alejandro.

40:38.700 --> 40:40.300
Good night.

40:54.280 --> 40:55.780
I kissed Sophie Wilder.

40:55.980 --> 40:57.450
Technically,
I made the first move.

40:57.680 --> 41:00.850
No! You're going to break
the sweet little boy's heart.

41:01.050 --> 41:02.220
That's big news!

41:02.420 --> 41:03.290
What's he gonna do?

41:03.490 --> 41:05.060
What about the Adam deal?

41:05.260 --> 41:06.940
I asked if they were together.

41:07.140 --> 41:08.460
What did she say?

41:08.960 --> 41:11.300
- Well, I kissed him.
- You can do whatever you want!

41:11.500 --> 41:14.170
If Aurelia finds out, she'll
kill me. I can't risk my job.

41:14.370 --> 41:17.700
Relax. You're nervous.
She won't find out.

41:17.910 --> 41:20.570
If Adam finds out,
he is going to lose it.

41:20.810 --> 41:22.740
- I don't care.
- Don't care?

41:22.940 --> 41:24.180
Be honest.

41:24.380 --> 41:27.110
Did you feel butterflies
in your stomach?

41:28.350 --> 41:30.250
[Tachi] Come on, you did!
You did!

41:30.980 --> 41:32.420
Cheers!

41:33.350 --> 41:35.050
[laughter]

41:35.260 --> 41:36.560
[Alejandro]
I still feel them.

41:36.760 --> 41:38.060
I can feel them.

41:43.730 --> 41:45.030
[Adam] Hey, Sophie!

41:45.830 --> 41:47.100
[Sophie] Adam.

41:48.500 --> 41:50.170
[Adam] Look, um,

41:50.370 --> 41:51.840
I know we never discussed

41:52.040 --> 41:54.170
it, but

41:54.780 --> 41:57.880
I feel like it'd be best
if we were together.

41:58.080 --> 42:00.910
And I know I need to apologize

42:01.210 --> 42:02.950
to us.

42:03.280 --> 42:07.220
I've been going through
an identify defusion.

42:09.060 --> 42:10.290
I'm sorry, a what?

42:10.490 --> 42:12.560
No, I... I know.
The language... it seems broad.

42:12.760 --> 42:14.060
Um...

42:14.260 --> 42:17.200
I just want to discuss
our romantic terms.

42:17.860 --> 42:19.500
And...

42:19.870 --> 42:22.100
the idea of us getting back
together,

42:22.300 --> 42:25.140
after such
a traumatic experience.

42:27.210 --> 42:29.780
It's got legs. Doesn't it?

42:29.980 --> 42:33.050
[birds chirping]

42:33.310 --> 42:35.850
Wow! I, um...

42:37.050 --> 42:39.490
I just need some space.

42:40.050 --> 42:43.120
Sure. Yeah. Well,
it was good to...

42:43.320 --> 42:44.820
- Right, space.
- Space.

42:45.030 --> 42:47.130
Sorry. All right.

42:50.560 --> 42:52.900
You want space?

42:58.910 --> 43:01.310
How's this for space?!

43:07.910 --> 43:12.050
[sound of sea]

43:21.260 --> 43:22.600
Rest well, Santi.

43:22.800 --> 43:24.870
- See you tomorrow, Marquitos.
- See you later, sir.

43:33.940 --> 43:34.940
- [Sophie] (-Hello?)
- Hey!

43:35.180 --> 43:37.040
Hello, you.

43:37.240 --> 43:40.180
[Alejandro on the phone]
(So... my shift ends at midnight.)

43:40.510 --> 43:42.580
(Fancy a night swim?)

43:43.320 --> 43:45.420
Sounds fine.

43:45.650 --> 43:49.120
By that I'm mean
that I'll be there soon.

43:50.390 --> 43:55.430
[romantic music]

44:22.390 --> 44:23.890
Miss Wilder!

44:24.090 --> 44:26.530
Good evening. So sorry,
I was just walking.

44:26.730 --> 44:28.230
It's okay!

44:28.530 --> 44:30.000
Have a good night.

44:30.200 --> 44:32.170
[maid] Good night, Miss Wilder.

44:33.670 --> 44:38.540
[romantic music]

44:48.550 --> 44:50.050
How are you, Chuy?

44:50.250 --> 44:51.920
Can you sign this, boss?

44:52.120 --> 44:53.650
Let's see.

44:54.120 --> 44:56.390
As legend has it, the only way
to get my power back

44:56.590 --> 44:59.430
is with a sacrifice.
Thousands of years ago...

45:00.230 --> 45:01.290
Ready?

45:01.490 --> 45:02.360
And

45:02.560 --> 45:03.400
action!

45:03.600 --> 45:05.030
(Are you trying to seduce me?)

45:05.230 --> 45:07.200
[Alejandro] Miss Calloway,
I'm your lawyer!

45:08.100 --> 45:10.940
(You're telling me I'll never see)
(you again and I'm telling you)

45:11.140 --> 45:13.410
(I won't let that happen.)
(I can't let that happen.)

45:13.610 --> 45:16.080
The jury is gonna lock you away
for a crime you didn't commit.

45:16.280 --> 45:18.240
[Sophia] (I did not steal)
(those jewels!)

45:18.450 --> 45:19.380
[laughter]

45:19.580 --> 45:20.850
(Sorry.)

45:21.280 --> 45:23.320
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, no.

45:23.520 --> 45:26.420
- You're making it.
- No, stop. Stop. Okay.

45:26.620 --> 45:29.120
[she clears her throat]

45:31.460 --> 45:34.330
Mr. Baxter,
you're a good lawyer.

45:34.530 --> 45:37.230
The best those big
Fifth Avenue bucks can buy.

45:37.430 --> 45:40.170
But what does the law
say about falling in love?!

45:41.300 --> 45:43.240
What's so funny? What?

45:43.440 --> 45:45.610
- You're taking it very seriously.
- I'm in character!

45:45.810 --> 45:47.110
[laughter]

45:47.310 --> 45:49.240
I know, it's great!
You're, wow!

45:49.440 --> 45:50.480
Coffee talk.

45:50.680 --> 45:52.980
Hot dogs. Brooklyn. Let's go!
Come on!

45:53.180 --> 45:55.480
I'm not gonna book
"New York or Nowhere" anyway.

45:55.680 --> 45:58.580
It's gonna go to a Lily. For some
reason it always goes to a Lily.

45:58.790 --> 46:01.250
Yeah. It's okay because I said
I wouldn't do a remake anyway.

46:01.450 --> 46:02.990
- This is...
- I love this film.

46:03.190 --> 46:05.090
I know. This is literally
the best acting

46:05.290 --> 46:06.290
I've ever seen in my life.

46:06.490 --> 46:08.130
No, really.
You are crushing it!

46:08.330 --> 46:09.830
- Yeah.
- You are killing it!

46:10.030 --> 46:11.630
You haven't seen
enough acting.

46:12.530 --> 46:14.270
Thank you. Thank you.

46:14.470 --> 46:17.600
You're a much better scene
partner than Adam. He...

46:18.600 --> 46:21.140
I... Sorry. Never mind.

46:21.640 --> 46:23.310
What are we doing?

46:25.450 --> 46:28.950
[romantic music]

46:29.150 --> 46:31.180
Guest relations?

46:31.380 --> 46:33.420
[chuckles]

46:34.650 --> 46:36.620
Are you dating Adam?

46:37.320 --> 46:40.230
It's all over the internet.
It's all everyone talks about.

46:44.330 --> 46:45.830
[knock on the door]

46:46.030 --> 46:47.500
Did you order something?

46:48.500 --> 46:50.470
No, I have no idea.

46:50.670 --> 46:52.140
Um...

46:52.340 --> 46:53.410
Uh...

46:53.610 --> 46:55.170
I'll go through the door
on the back.

46:55.380 --> 46:57.080
- I'm gonna go on the back.
- Okay.

47:01.350 --> 47:02.150
Hi!

47:02.350 --> 47:04.480
Good night, Mrs. Wilder

47:04.680 --> 47:06.650
- Come on in.
- This was sent for you.

47:06.850 --> 47:10.560
Did you have seen
the view to Isla Mujeres?

47:10.760 --> 47:14.260
Yeah, yeah. It's beautiful.
And the room it's... so great.

47:14.460 --> 47:16.830
Did you have the opportunity
to watch it?

47:17.200 --> 47:18.560
- To Isla?
- Yeah!

47:18.770 --> 47:22.940
We can arrange a special tour
for you and mister Clark.

47:23.170 --> 47:26.410
That would... be great.

47:26.610 --> 47:27.940
So charming.

47:28.170 --> 47:30.110
[voice on walkie talkie]
(Are you there, Alejandro?)

47:30.310 --> 47:33.680
[Sophie] So, this is really
incredible. Uh...

47:33.880 --> 47:35.610
I didn't realize
how great it was.

47:35.820 --> 47:37.680
So I think I'm gonna

47:39.850 --> 47:41.190
go to sleep soon.

47:41.390 --> 47:43.220
[Aurelia] Yes. Yes. Yes.
We are leaving.

47:43.420 --> 47:44.360
[Sophie] So sorry.

47:44.560 --> 47:46.890
- It's a pleasure.
- Good night.

47:49.800 --> 47:51.700
Man! That was close!

47:54.330 --> 47:55.500
Damn!

48:01.370 --> 48:03.710
TO DR. THUNDER AND FIREPHINA,
THE MOST POWERFUL COUPLE

48:03.910 --> 48:05.580
IN THE WORLD.
HAVE A GREAT SHOOT.

48:09.580 --> 48:12.020
You wanted to know
about Adam and me.

48:12.750 --> 48:15.420
He cheated on me.
So much like the characters

48:15.620 --> 48:17.860
in the films
that we're starring.

48:19.230 --> 48:20.890
It's all pretend.

48:21.460 --> 48:24.460
So you fake being in love?
Why?

48:26.400 --> 48:29.040
I don't wanna be
treated like another Jen.

48:29.640 --> 48:32.620
I have no idea what that means.

48:32.820 --> 48:35.380
It's embarrassing.
Can we not talk about it?

48:39.750 --> 48:41.750
I have a surprise for you.

48:41.950 --> 48:44.780
Some place
we won't be interrupted.

48:46.890 --> 48:48.590
And...

48:48.790 --> 48:51.460
Midnight with you
is my favorite hour.

48:52.430 --> 48:54.460
Midnight isn't a time.

48:54.660 --> 48:57.500
It's a place
for us to be together.

Hello.

- Yes!

We both have the day off

50:28.290 --> 50:30.790

for you until tomorrow.

taking me?

I can't tell you.

Oh, there's no...
there's no reception.

51:54.910 --> 51:57.210
(from the kidnapper.)
(Dear Pete...)

51:57.440 --> 51:58.840
[ring tone]

52:01.110 --> 52:02.550
Yes?

52:02.780 --> 52:04.650
[Jamie on the phone] (Rachel!)
(It's Jamie from production.)

52:04.850 --> 52:06.250
Amazing!

52:06.450 --> 52:08.450
(Deborah Jackson Cast wrote)
(from LA and said she wants)

52:08.660 --> 52:11.760
(to get dinner tonight to discuss)
(Sophie's future projects.)

52:12.060 --> 52:14.960
Yes, I love that.
That's perfect. Um...

52:15.160 --> 52:17.700
Let me just check, double check
with her schedule

52:17.900 --> 52:19.430
and I will get back to you.

52:19.630 --> 52:21.530
[Jamie] (The fate)
(of Firephina depends on it.)

52:21.730 --> 52:24.070
You are hilarious.
I'm laughing.

52:24.400 --> 52:26.970
Okay. Thank you,
pleasure's mine. Bye bye.

52:32.680 --> 52:35.880
[voice mail] (Hello, no one)
(is available to take your call.)

52:36.080 --> 52:37.420
(Please, leave...)

52:37.620 --> 52:40.150
Are you ready to experience
the magic of a national

52:40.420 --> 52:42.020
gastronomical treasure?

52:43.160 --> 52:44.990
Chips and sauce?

52:45.190 --> 52:47.640
How dare you?
No!

52:47.840 --> 52:50.900
- Prepared chips.
- "Prepared chips".

52:51.100 --> 52:53.630
Good. Can you hand me
a Pacifico, please?

52:53.830 --> 52:55.770
Yes. Of course.

52:55.970 --> 52:57.170
Thank you.

53:03.180 --> 53:06.180
[voice mail] (Hello, no one)
(is available to take your call.)

53:06.450 --> 53:08.050
(Please leave a message)
(after the...)

53:08.250 --> 53:10.850
- With our eyes.
- With our eyes.

53:11.850 --> 53:13.520
If not it's very bad luck.

53:14.220 --> 53:15.590
So, first,

53:15.790 --> 53:17.060
a little bit of Maggi.

53:17.420 --> 53:19.630
A little love in there,
pum, pum.

53:19.930 --> 53:20.690
Then,

53:20.890 --> 53:22.250
English sauce.

53:22.450 --> 53:25.000
No one leaves voice mails
but I'm leaving this voice mail

53:25.200 --> 53:28.370
so you know I tried to connect.
Okay.

53:29.170 --> 53:33.240
Lime. Here in Mexico we put
lime on everything.

53:33.870 --> 53:34.810
Okay.

53:38.780 --> 53:40.580
It's a lot of lime.

53:40.780 --> 53:41.780
[Alejandro] Oh yeah.

53:45.920 --> 53:47.050
Ready?

53:48.050 --> 53:56.030
[romantic music]

54:00.100 --> 54:02.000
So when are you opening up
your hotel?

54:04.770 --> 54:08.110
I don't know. I keep telling
myself 'next year',

54:08.310 --> 54:10.280
the year after that, but

54:10.540 --> 54:13.310
then I have to go to New York
in a couple of months and...

54:13.650 --> 54:15.720
I love New York. It's

54:16.680 --> 54:19.180
crowded and dirty and full

54:19.590 --> 54:22.020
of trash and rats,

54:23.620 --> 54:25.830
but it's so magical.

54:31.860 --> 54:33.930
So what's stopping you

54:34.130 --> 54:36.240
from opening up your place?

54:37.600 --> 54:39.310
Honestly?

54:41.670 --> 54:43.930
It scares the shit out of me.

54:44.130 --> 54:45.610
Why?

54:45.810 --> 54:47.780
What if I fail?

54:48.110 --> 54:50.150
What if I open it
and no one shows up?

54:50.350 --> 54:53.890
Or even worse, what if
I open it and no one likes it?

54:54.120 --> 54:56.790
Have you ever read some of
the comments on Trip Advisor?

54:56.990 --> 54:58.820
They're ruthless!

54:59.030 --> 55:02.630
Alejandro, what if
you never try?

55:07.230 --> 55:08.870
"Puta madre"!

55:09.740 --> 55:10.640
What does that mean?

55:10.840 --> 55:11.800
"Puta madre"?

55:12.000 --> 55:12.840
It means...

55:13.040 --> 55:14.670
Motherfucker!

55:17.140 --> 55:18.680
Hi, don't be mad.
She's in the hotel.

55:18.880 --> 55:20.580
- It's just a very big hotel.
- Rachel, listen to me.

55:20.780 --> 55:22.780
- Rachel, listen to me.
- She hadn't mentioned going to...

55:22.980 --> 55:25.920
Rachel, please listen to me!
Listen to me what I'm asking you!

55:26.120 --> 55:28.990
No, Rachel, seriously,
stop talking.

55:29.190 --> 55:32.640
Where is she? Okay?
What the hell is going on?

55:32.840 --> 55:34.590
- She's definitely in the hotel.
- Is she?

55:34.790 --> 55:36.700
- Are we sure?
- I wouldn't lie.

55:36.900 --> 55:38.700
Any ideas as to where
in the hotel she may be?

55:38.900 --> 55:40.830
She had wanted to do
this acroyoga class.

55:41.030 --> 55:42.030
For 10 hours?

55:42.230 --> 55:43.500
And she needed lift face
resveratrol.

55:43.700 --> 55:45.600
Okay. She's getting a zombie
facial for 10 hours?

55:45.810 --> 55:47.040
Yes, and she's doing...
She's fine.

55:47.240 --> 55:49.440
We have to talk
to a professional. Excuse me.

55:49.680 --> 55:54.250
Did anyone say anything at any
point about her going anywhere

55:54.610 --> 55:56.180
- with anyone?
- No, I'm sorry .

55:56.380 --> 55:57.850
- Thank you, Aurelia.
- Yes.

55:58.050 --> 56:00.890
I guess we're gonna have full
dateline and call the police.

56:01.090 --> 56:02.260
- No!
- No, no, no!

56:02.450 --> 56:04.460
Look who's here!
I didn't know you were coming.

56:04.720 --> 56:06.190
- Sophie's gone missing...
- Relax.

56:06.390 --> 56:08.030
- What?
- and we don't know where she is.

56:08.230 --> 56:09.600
Missing is a very extreme word.

56:09.800 --> 56:11.330
Hey! Quiet! Quiet everybody!

56:12.870 --> 56:14.300
I got this.

56:14.770 --> 56:16.200
We need the schematics
of the building.

56:16.400 --> 56:18.470
I need to get in your main frame.
You understand me?

56:18.740 --> 56:19.810
¿Comprende?

56:20.010 --> 56:21.040
Also, we need a couple
of blood hounds.

56:21.240 --> 56:22.580
Whatever kind of dogs
you can get.

56:22.780 --> 56:24.640
An article of her clothing,
preferably underwear.

56:24.840 --> 56:26.930
The dogs love it, okay?

56:27.130 --> 56:30.950
Oh, my god! Why would I ask
an actor to do anything?

56:32.720 --> 56:38.060
[sound of waves]

56:45.330 --> 56:46.970
So,

56:47.930 --> 56:50.170
how's Sophie Wilder doing?

56:51.000 --> 56:53.010
Miserable at best.

56:53.810 --> 56:55.170
[chuckles]

56:55.370 --> 56:59.340
No, seriously. I mean,
you have a lot of stuff going on.

57:02.720 --> 57:04.350
Uh...

57:09.420 --> 57:11.960
Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty
caught up in work.

57:12.160 --> 57:14.030
Firephina above all.

57:14.230 --> 57:15.860
She's great.

57:16.060 --> 57:17.960
Who wouldn't want
to be a superhero?

57:18.160 --> 57:19.630
But sometimes
there is a lot of pressure

57:19.830 --> 57:23.870
because people love her
so much.

57:25.470 --> 57:29.270
The costume, you know,
and the catchphrases

57:29.480 --> 57:33.150
and the intensity.
People get really into it.

57:33.710 --> 57:36.580
And so do I.
It's a huge part of my life.

57:37.120 --> 57:41.090
But sometimes I wonder...

57:43.760 --> 57:45.460
who am I?

57:47.360 --> 57:49.160
Well I'm a fan.

57:49.360 --> 57:51.130
Oh, no, you watched.

57:51.330 --> 57:53.070
Not of Firephina.

57:54.130 --> 57:56.070
Of you, Sophie.

57:56.870 --> 58:01.810
[romantic music]

58:05.810 --> 58:12.790
[romantic music]

58:20.390 --> 58:22.130
[Alejandro]
Good morning.

58:23.230 --> 58:24.800
Want some coffee?

58:27.370 --> 58:29.030
[Sophie] I fell sleep.

58:31.840 --> 58:33.340
Oh my god!

58:33.540 --> 58:35.270
I wasn't supposed
to stay overnight.

58:36.980 --> 58:40.350
Everybody's probably looking
for me. What time is it?

58:41.380 --> 58:42.820
Shit!

58:45.320 --> 58:46.790
We need to go.

58:47.850 --> 58:48.920
We...

58:49.120 --> 58:50.090
We need to go.

58:50.290 --> 58:52.190
- You okay?
- No, we have to go!

58:53.160 --> 58:55.430
Like... like right now.

59:00.030 --> 59:02.170
- We have to go!
- Man! Okay!

59:07.370 --> 59:10.840
[Rachel]
(It's me again. This is...)

59:11.040 --> 59:12.380
[chuckles]
(It's not cute anymore.)

59:12.580 --> 59:14.180
(Please let me know)
(where you are.)

59:14.380 --> 59:17.350
[Chris] (Sophie, I don't know)
(what else to do)

59:17.550 --> 59:19.480
(so I'm flying to Mexico.)

59:19.850 --> 59:21.920
(Weird airline and coach.)

59:22.120 --> 59:25.220
Don't worry, we're almost there.
I'm sure you'll be fine.

59:25.420 --> 59:28.110
No.
This is not fine.

59:28.310 --> 59:30.460
Calm down, Sophie.

59:31.260 --> 59:34.030
I shouldn't even be here!
We shouldn't have done this!

59:34.230 --> 59:37.070
I'm not on vacation!
I'm here for work!

59:37.270 --> 59:39.100
This was a huge mistake!

59:39.470 --> 59:41.610
My job is at stake too,
you know?

59:41.870 --> 59:43.840
It's a little different,
Alejandro.

59:47.450 --> 59:51.320
What the hell were you thinking
going off God knows where?

59:51.520 --> 59:53.650
Do you know how worried
we were for you?

59:53.890 --> 59:55.120
Not to mention
I had to leave LA

59:55.320 --> 59:58.160
in the middle of a very
exclusive healing circle

59:58.360 --> 1:00:00.990
with Ashton Kutcher and
Mila Kunis as shamans

1:00:01.190 --> 1:00:03.200
so that I could come
looking for you!

1:00:03.400 --> 1:00:04.660
Okay?

1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:07.230
Do I look like
a babysitter to you?

1:00:07.430 --> 1:00:08.870
Huh?

1:00:09.070 --> 1:00:11.800
Do you see me with a little Baby
Bjorn and some mushed carrots

1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:15.370
ready to attend your every need?
I have other clients, Soph. Okay?

1:00:15.810 --> 1:00:19.180
I was supposed to be at Florence
Pugh's cookbook release party

1:00:19.380 --> 1:00:22.380
at the Barnes & Noble
at The Grove,

1:00:22.580 --> 1:00:26.720
eating her signature one pan
chicken cacciatore but, uh uh.

1:00:26.950 --> 1:00:29.020
I'm out here playing
grab ass looking for you!

1:00:29.220 --> 1:00:30.690
I said I was sorry.

1:00:31.190 --> 1:00:33.030
I needed to get out of here.
My phone died.

1:00:33.230 --> 1:00:36.160
- I stayed at a hotel nearby.
- We had to call the police,

1:00:36.360 --> 1:00:40.630
Sophie! The freaking "policía"!
Okay?

1:00:40.930 --> 1:00:46.100
And I had to do some very bad
things with a low level intern

1:00:46.310 --> 1:00:48.110
at TMZ so that this
didn't become

1:00:48.310 --> 1:00:51.710
a freaking
international media frenzy!

1:00:51.940 --> 1:00:54.480
Okay, I think she gets it.

1:00:55.010 --> 1:00:59.280
Deborah Jackson Katz from the
studio was here to talk to you

1:00:59.490 --> 1:01:03.220
about your standalone feature
and guess who wasn't here?

1:01:03.960 --> 1:01:05.660
Any guesses?

1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:08.330
The answer is you.

1:01:08.530 --> 1:01:10.730
You weren't here.

1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:13.670
In the hotel by the sea.

1:01:14.300 --> 1:01:18.140
And that's a big problem,
sister friend.

1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:21.570
Now, not even...

1:01:21.870 --> 1:01:25.180
as one of the Hollywood
reporters

1:01:25.380 --> 1:01:28.250
35 under 35 entertainment
professionals,

1:01:28.450 --> 1:01:34.620
but as your friend,
you could've called or texted

1:01:35.050 --> 1:01:37.290
so I knew you were okay.

1:01:37.490 --> 1:01:41.990
Okay? Now, you have
two weeks left on this film.

1:01:42.190 --> 1:01:43.630
I want you...

1:01:44.230 --> 1:01:48.000
to get Demi Moore's
reiki specialist on Zoom

1:01:48.200 --> 1:01:52.370
if that's what it takes for you
to pull yourself together

1:01:52.570 --> 1:01:57.240
to finish this fantastic movie.
"Capisce"?

1:01:57.610 --> 1:01:59.180
I've had enough.

1:01:59.380 --> 1:02:01.380
I'm gonna go eat
a taquito

1:02:01.580 --> 1:02:05.420
and think about this
and I want you to repent.

1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:15.030
Thank you so much
for not saying anything.

1:02:15.230 --> 1:02:16.360
Duh! Oh my god!

1:02:16.560 --> 1:02:18.160
Alejandro would be
in more trouble than me.

1:02:18.360 --> 1:02:20.370
Please, I care about you and
your heart way more

1:02:20.570 --> 1:02:25.910
than this Hollywood stuff.
Plus, you looked happy as shit.

1:02:26.540 --> 1:02:29.210
Everyone was looking for her
like idiots

1:02:29.410 --> 1:02:31.540
for her to say
her phone died

1:02:31.740 --> 1:02:34.450
and that she couldn't
let anyone know.

1:02:34.650 --> 1:02:36.480
Can you believe it?
She's so selfish!

1:02:36.680 --> 1:02:38.120
That's crazy.

1:02:46.590 --> 1:02:48.230
You scared us.

1:02:50.430 --> 1:02:53.170
I... I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.

1:02:53.370 --> 1:02:55.230
[Adam] To err is human.

1:02:55.430 --> 1:02:56.840
To forgive is divine.

1:02:57.100 --> 1:02:59.870
I wanna get back together,
Sophie. I really do.

1:03:00.140 --> 1:03:02.570
Cheating is romantic,
if you think about it.

1:03:02.770 --> 1:03:05.580
Look, I know I made
a huge mistake.

1:03:08.180 --> 1:03:10.420
Do you really want
to be treated like

1:03:11.350 --> 1:03:12.750
just another Jen?

1:03:14.750 --> 1:03:16.820
Sophie Wilder and Firephina.

1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:18.860
How much do you two
have in common?

1:03:19.090 --> 1:03:20.530
Are you the same person
at this point?

1:03:20.730 --> 1:03:22.430
Well, I booked the part when
I was in my early twenties,

1:03:22.630 --> 1:03:25.160
so, you know, when you play
a character for that long,

1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:27.600
they inevitably become
a part of who you are.

1:03:27.800 --> 1:03:31.000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Um...

1:03:31.770 --> 1:03:34.140
Going in depth.
Sorry, to you or the camera?

1:03:34.340 --> 1:03:35.440
To him.

1:03:35.640 --> 1:03:37.810
- [assistant] -To, uh, to...
- I'm asking him.

1:03:38.480 --> 1:03:39.780
- To me please.
- Okay.

1:03:41.310 --> 1:03:45.280
The love story between us
is about the unforeseen.

1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:48.190
And Doctor Thunder
has been alive for centuries.

1:03:48.390 --> 1:03:51.520
Meanwhile, Firephina
is the newer young soul

1:03:51.720 --> 1:03:54.790
that's fiery. Right. It's quite

1:03:55.230 --> 1:03:58.660
unexpected that he
would have her as a wingman.

1:03:58.860 --> 1:04:00.670
- Why is that?
- But...

1:04:01.070 --> 1:04:02.940
Because, uh,

1:04:03.300 --> 1:04:08.440
Doctor Thunder is this bitter
intellectual god type and she's,

1:04:08.670 --> 1:04:10.940
she's just corky. [chuckles]

1:04:11.310 --> 1:04:12.910
[Sophie] -Corky?
[Adam] -Yeah.

1:04:13.180 --> 1:04:16.350
She's the keeper of the
sacred flame of Kukulcan.

1:04:16.550 --> 1:04:17.650
- [reporter] -Okay...
- Well...

1:04:17.850 --> 1:04:19.080
As part of the vibe
I never caught,

1:04:19.290 --> 1:04:21.350
I think we're getting
to oily territory

1:04:21.550 --> 1:04:23.060
which I think we wanna try
to avoid.

1:04:23.260 --> 1:04:26.260
But that's what I love
about Sophie Wilder.

1:04:26.460 --> 1:04:28.590
Her enthusiasm for learning
and growing it.

1:04:28.790 --> 1:04:30.930
I think she's coming along fine.

1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:33.570
You know what my favorite
thing about Adam Clark is?

1:04:33.770 --> 1:04:35.130
What's that?

1:04:37.200 --> 1:04:39.200
He is such
a skilled snake charmer.

1:04:39.410 --> 1:04:40.610
All right,
I think we've had enough.

1:04:40.810 --> 1:04:41.940
- Thanks.
- Great!

1:04:42.170 --> 1:04:43.110
[Adam] Very unprofessional.

1:04:43.510 --> 1:04:46.180
Hey! Is this about
that lobby boy, right?

1:04:46.380 --> 1:04:49.410
Look, if you wanna get back at me
or teach me some sort of lesson,

1:04:49.620 --> 1:04:50.420
I get it. But...

1:04:50.620 --> 1:04:52.850
- him? Really?
- Wow!

1:04:53.850 --> 1:04:55.220
Okay...

1:04:55.420 --> 1:04:58.220
Whatever is going on
between me and Alejandro,

1:04:58.420 --> 1:05:00.630
who is incredible,
by the way,

1:05:00.830 --> 1:05:03.200
has nothing to do with you.

1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:05.130
[chuckles]
Oh, yeah? Is that right?

1:05:05.330 --> 1:05:07.700
You know what?
I'm not your pet project.

1:05:08.670 --> 1:05:10.270
You're not better than me!

1:05:10.470 --> 1:05:11.370
Okay?

1:05:11.570 --> 1:05:13.470
And I don't need you,

1:05:14.510 --> 1:05:16.480
to be me.

1:05:18.880 --> 1:05:22.550
- And you're a terrible poet!
- Wow!

1:05:22.750 --> 1:05:24.280
Except for that Pablo Neruda
you played.

1:05:24.480 --> 1:05:27.420
- I did not...
- This feels incredible!

1:05:27.620 --> 1:05:33.230
He paid people in college
to write his papers for him!

1:05:33.430 --> 1:05:36.530
- She's making it up!
- We are firing Margo Cohen.

1:05:40.400 --> 1:05:41.670
"Hey it's Sophie.
We need to talk.

1:05:41.870 --> 1:05:42.970
Can you meet on the beach?"

1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:44.670
- Dude, that's awesome!
- Of course not!

1:05:44.870 --> 1:05:45.970
"We need to talk"?

1:05:46.170 --> 1:05:47.740
It's terrible news.
That's a bad text.

1:05:47.940 --> 1:05:49.410
It can't be.
Look at that.

1:05:49.610 --> 1:05:52.240
- It has no punctuation. Nothing.
- That's actually good.

1:05:52.440 --> 1:05:54.280
That means
it's open to interpretation.

1:05:54.480 --> 1:05:57.620
- It means she was mad!
- It's okay! Listen.

1:05:57.820 --> 1:06:00.490
I think she wants to see you,
apologize

1:06:00.690 --> 1:06:01.750
and tell you she loves you.

1:06:01.950 --> 1:06:04.020
- Really?
- Sure! Why would she text you?

1:06:04.260 --> 1:06:05.760
What film do you live in?
Of course not!

1:06:05.960 --> 1:06:08.790
- No, no, no.
- I know life is not a movie.

1:06:09.190 --> 1:06:11.260
Ok, maybe this is good news.
You know?

1:06:11.460 --> 1:06:12.630
We almost got caught.
It's complicated.

1:06:12.830 --> 1:06:14.770
I need to end this now!

1:06:14.970 --> 1:06:17.370
Listen.
Love is complicated.

1:06:17.570 --> 1:06:19.700
Do you love her?
Go get her.

1:06:22.210 --> 1:06:23.640
[Sophie]
I was just so overwhelmed

1:06:23.840 --> 1:06:25.510
and I treated you unfairly.

1:06:25.710 --> 1:06:26.910
I...

1:06:27.180 --> 1:06:29.050
There's no need to apologize.

1:06:29.350 --> 1:06:32.220
But I like who I am
when I'm with you.

1:06:32.420 --> 1:06:34.150
And I like who I am
when I'm with you but...

1:06:34.350 --> 1:06:35.990
Wait, wait. I'm not finished.

1:06:37.820 --> 1:06:39.790
I pretended to be with Adam.
You know what?

1:06:39.990 --> 1:06:42.290
It doesn't...
It doesn't even matter.

1:06:43.500 --> 1:06:45.800
It's over. I ended that.

1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:50.000
And now you and I don't have
to pretend, to hide anymore.

1:06:51.400 --> 1:06:54.370
Okay, but...
My future is still on the line.

1:06:54.570 --> 1:06:55.740
You know? And...

1:06:55.940 --> 1:06:58.240
Yeah, you're right.
That's a fantastic point.

1:06:58.440 --> 1:07:00.380
Didn't you say you want
to open up a place?

1:07:00.580 --> 1:07:02.680
Yeah, but that's...
that's later.

1:07:02.880 --> 1:07:03.950
Later?

1:07:10.760 --> 1:07:13.860
I have the weekend off.
You wanna run away?

1:07:15.890 --> 1:07:19.400
I would love to, really.
But I have to go to Mexico City.

1:07:19.600 --> 1:07:21.870
It's my sister's birthday and
I told my family I'd be there.

1:07:22.070 --> 1:07:23.870
Normally I'd be excited,

1:07:24.470 --> 1:07:27.410
but my dad is gonna be there
with his new lover.

1:07:27.610 --> 1:07:29.410
Dad and his new lover.

1:07:30.540 --> 1:07:31.610
Ugh, yeah.

1:07:31.810 --> 1:07:33.550
I'll go with you.

1:07:33.850 --> 1:07:36.120
- To Mexico City?
- Yeah.

1:07:37.020 --> 1:07:41.690
Oh, come on! I've never been!
And this really great guy told me

1:07:41.890 --> 1:07:44.990
(that it's a great city with)
(all this incredible food)

1:07:45.460 --> 1:07:48.630
(and dancing, and that's where)
(I could really learn my Spanish.)

1:07:49.360 --> 1:07:51.760
(We've both been working)
(so hard. We deserve it.)

1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:53.400
(Maybe I can get us a jet.)

1:07:55.070 --> 1:07:56.740
[Alejandro] (But...)

1:07:57.300 --> 1:07:59.600
(what about paparazzi?)
(What if they see us?)

1:07:59.810 --> 1:08:01.110
[Sophie] (So what? I'd love
that!)

1:08:01.370 --> 1:08:02.870
[Alejandro] (Aurelia would not.)
(I'd get fired, Sophie.)

1:08:03.070 --> 1:08:04.740
[Sophie] (Alejandro, no one)
(is gonna take our photo.)

1:08:04.940 --> 1:08:07.460
(It's gonna be fun. Relax.)

1:08:07.660 --> 1:08:10.780
It is impossible
to say no to you.

1:08:10.980 --> 1:08:12.150
And you know that.

1:08:12.450 --> 1:08:15.620
[Sophie] (No, you're doing)
(this 'cuz you want to.)

1:08:17.820 --> 1:08:18.620
[chuckles]

1:08:18.820 --> 1:08:23.700
[romantic music]

1:08:29.630 --> 1:08:35.540
[romantic music]

1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:57.560
[romantic music]

1:09:11.810 --> 1:09:12.840
What?

1:09:13.880 --> 1:09:16.050
[scream of fright]

1:09:16.980 --> 1:09:18.480
I'm sorry!

1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:19.780
[chuckles]

1:09:24.120 --> 1:09:27.990
[fans screaming]

1:09:29.130 --> 1:09:32.560
[indistinct dialogue]

1:09:41.740 --> 1:09:44.080
[fan] Who is he, Sophie?
Is he your new beau?

1:09:54.790 --> 1:09:56.290
- Are you ready?
- This is it?

1:09:56.690 --> 1:09:58.090
Wait until you see the inside.

1:10:01.990 --> 1:10:03.860
Don't be nervous.
They'll love you.

1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:06.800
I'm not nervous.

1:10:07.530 --> 1:10:09.870
I get along very well
with parents.

1:10:10.070 --> 1:10:11.600
Barbara and I
are still very close.

1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:13.240
Who's Barbara?

1:10:13.510 --> 1:10:14.870
Don't worry about it.

1:10:16.540 --> 1:10:18.580
Oh, shit. I forgot something
in the car. I'll be right back.

1:10:18.780 --> 1:10:21.080
- You... but...
- The bottle. I'll be right back.

1:10:22.450 --> 1:10:23.880
Should I...?

1:10:25.850 --> 1:10:27.020
No.

1:10:28.950 --> 1:10:30.760
I didn't ring the doorbell.

1:10:34.060 --> 1:10:35.760
Hi there!

1:10:36.730 --> 1:10:39.000
[scream]

1:10:39.200 --> 1:10:41.300
- Hi.
- I'm sorry.

1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:43.270
I'm here with Alejandro.

1:10:43.540 --> 1:10:44.400
- Hi.
- Hi!

1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:46.270
Happy birthday.

1:10:46.540 --> 1:10:47.810
- Thank you!
- What's wrong, Sebas?

1:10:48.010 --> 1:10:50.010
Sophie,
this is my sister Daniela.

1:10:50.540 --> 1:10:52.040
- Hi.
- What's up, Akilita?

1:10:52.240 --> 1:10:53.480
Nice to meet you.
Happy birthday!

1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:55.210
They're lovely!
Thank you!

1:10:55.480 --> 1:10:57.580
This is Sebastian.
Akila. Come in.

1:10:57.880 --> 1:10:59.050
Akila!

1:10:59.580 --> 1:11:00.790
How are you, Sebas?

1:11:00.990 --> 1:11:02.250
So good to see you!

1:11:02.550 --> 1:11:03.560
Guess who's here.

1:11:04.590 --> 1:11:05.860
My love!

1:11:06.060 --> 1:11:07.390
Hi, mom!

1:11:08.030 --> 1:11:10.630
- You got here so fast, my love.
- Yes.

1:11:10.830 --> 1:11:11.860
- Any traffic?
- No.

1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:13.700
Thank you.

1:11:13.900 --> 1:11:16.370
This is my grandmother, Annie.
Sophie.

1:11:16.600 --> 1:11:18.100
Annie, nice to meet you.

1:11:18.500 --> 1:11:19.790
- Nice to meet you.
- My grandma.

1:11:19.990 --> 1:11:21.740
And my mom, Monica. Sophie.

1:11:21.940 --> 1:11:24.910
Nice to meet you!
Welcome!

1:11:25.110 --> 1:11:26.840
She doesn't speak
a lot of Spanish so... English.

1:11:27.050 --> 1:11:29.350
We can say anything.
She won't understand.

1:11:29.580 --> 1:11:31.050
- No!
- A little.

1:11:31.580 --> 1:11:32.980
It's so nice to meet you, guys.

1:11:33.180 --> 1:11:36.420
- You're welcome, Sophie.
- It's great having you.

1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:38.770
Let me take your coat off.

1:11:38.970 --> 1:11:40.020
Yes, yes. Thank you.

1:11:41.660 --> 1:11:43.530
Come, I'll show you something.

1:11:43.730 --> 1:11:45.930
Here we have
the very Mexican table.

1:11:46.130 --> 1:11:47.600
This looks incredible.

1:11:47.800 --> 1:11:49.000
Sopes.

1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:50.700
Guacamole.

1:11:51.100 --> 1:11:51.970
Cheese.

1:11:52.170 --> 1:11:53.370
Thank you.

1:11:53.640 --> 1:11:54.370
Thank you, Sebas.

1:11:54.610 --> 1:11:55.340
Nopales.

1:11:55.540 --> 1:11:56.710
Those are very spicy.

1:11:56.910 --> 1:11:59.640
He made me "prepared chips"
the other day.

1:12:00.380 --> 1:12:01.510
He made you?

1:12:01.710 --> 1:12:02.950
And a cake.

1:12:03.150 --> 1:12:04.350
He cooked for you?

1:12:04.650 --> 1:12:05.720
Yeah!

1:12:05.980 --> 1:12:07.390
You don't even make
popcorn for my birthday.

1:12:07.650 --> 1:12:09.990
Of course I do.
Of course I do.

1:12:10.190 --> 1:12:12.620
Alejandro, come help me
in the kitchen.

1:12:12.820 --> 1:12:14.090
Now?

1:12:14.290 --> 1:12:15.960
I'll help you too, mom.
Stay with grandma, hon.

1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:17.500
Grandma, keep an eye on her!

1:12:17.700 --> 1:12:20.160
We'll be fine.
We'll use signs.

1:12:20.370 --> 1:12:22.000
- Right, sweetie? Sit here.
- Yes.

1:12:22.200 --> 1:12:23.990
I want to know everything!

1:12:24.190 --> 1:12:26.870
You didn't tell me
you'd bring someone!

1:12:27.070 --> 1:12:28.340
- Is she your girlfriend?
- It was last minute.

1:12:28.540 --> 1:12:30.310
- Do you want a beer?
- I want to know who she is.

1:12:30.910 --> 1:12:32.080
Son!

1:12:32.280 --> 1:12:34.310
She's a friend.
I met her at the hotel.

1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:38.750
- From LA?
- No one believes you. Come on.

1:12:38.980 --> 1:12:42.650
Listen. We met at the hotel.
She is working.

1:12:42.850 --> 1:12:44.690
We met, we became friends,
that's all!

1:12:44.890 --> 1:12:45.890
What work?

1:12:46.090 --> 1:12:49.460
"We are getting to
know each other."

1:12:49.690 --> 1:12:52.430
How are you "getting to know"
each other?

1:12:52.660 --> 1:12:54.470
- Tell me!
- Have you slept together?

1:12:54.770 --> 1:12:56.770
- Come on!
- They did!

1:12:56.970 --> 1:12:58.370
They love gossip.

1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:04.010
But you don't have
to keep me company.

1:13:04.210 --> 1:13:06.340
Join them in the kitchen!

1:13:07.680 --> 1:13:09.180
To the kitchen?
No, no, no.

1:13:09.380 --> 1:13:12.150
I don't cook.
I can't make a cake from a box.

1:13:14.220 --> 1:13:15.350
Cake!

1:13:15.950 --> 1:13:17.690
Grandma!

1:13:19.160 --> 1:13:21.030
Alejandro

1:13:21.230 --> 1:13:24.460
gave me some of your famous
recipe, your chocolate cake!

1:13:24.730 --> 1:13:25.430
Ah, yeah!

1:13:25.700 --> 1:13:27.170
I owe you a hug!

1:13:29.070 --> 1:13:31.470
Thank you very much!

1:13:31.700 --> 1:13:32.940
Let's toast for the pleasure
of being together!

1:13:33.140 --> 1:13:34.270
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1:13:35.070 --> 1:13:36.910
Happy birthday!

1:13:37.240 --> 1:13:38.340
Sh!

1:13:39.640 --> 1:13:41.110
It's Akilita.

1:13:41.310 --> 1:13:43.820
What's up, Akilita?
You scared me.

1:13:44.220 --> 1:13:46.450
What is it?
Come here! Akila!

1:13:46.720 --> 1:13:49.220
That's a very special pink.
It's called Mexican pink.

1:13:49.420 --> 1:13:52.060
- It's the same as on the taxis.
- Yeah.

1:13:52.260 --> 1:13:55.130
Then the jacaranda tree,
so everything was built...

1:13:55.330 --> 1:13:58.700
Oh, I gave your grandma a hug
for the chocolate cake recipe.

1:13:59.400 --> 1:14:00.500
No!

1:14:00.770 --> 1:14:02.880
Yeah.
I said I would.

1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:04.200
What?

1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:05.800
Why are you laughing?

1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:07.770
She hates chocolate cake.

1:14:07.970 --> 1:14:10.240
Hates it! I just didn't want
the night to end.

1:14:11.040 --> 1:14:12.080
You lied to me?

1:14:13.240 --> 1:14:15.250
You're a jester.

1:14:15.710 --> 1:14:17.880
[Alejandro senior]
This is Veronica, my fiancée.

1:14:18.250 --> 1:14:20.420
Happy birthday!

1:14:20.750 --> 1:14:22.490
Welcome!

1:14:22.920 --> 1:14:24.290
She's... she's young.

1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:25.970
Yeah.

1:14:26.170 --> 1:14:28.360
- Hi! Happy birthday!
- Alejandrito!

1:14:30.360 --> 1:14:31.230
Hi.

1:14:33.700 --> 1:14:35.270
- How are you?
- Fine.

1:14:35.470 --> 1:14:37.940
- This is Sophie, this is my...
- Alejandro, nice to meet you.

1:14:38.140 --> 1:14:39.240
Nice to meet you.

1:14:39.440 --> 1:14:40.940
She's my fiancé, Veronica.

1:14:41.140 --> 1:14:43.040
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1:14:43.780 --> 1:14:45.840
- Hi! Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1:14:46.040 --> 1:14:47.960
I've heard a lot about you
from your dad.

1:14:48.160 --> 1:14:49.280
Same here.

1:14:49.480 --> 1:14:52.380
I think I saw you
in one of those TV shows?

1:14:53.350 --> 1:14:54.550
You're an actress.

1:14:54.890 --> 1:14:57.020
- Yeah, yeah, I am.
- Great!

1:14:57.220 --> 1:15:01.060
I imagine you stay quite busy.
What's your next project?

1:15:01.790 --> 1:15:03.360
Um...

1:15:03.560 --> 1:15:06.060
I'm not actually sure. I'm just
circling some things right now.

1:15:06.260 --> 1:15:07.600
Oh, great for you!

1:15:07.830 --> 1:15:10.740
You can have Alejandro
picking up all those red M&Ms

1:15:10.940 --> 1:15:12.840
and carrying luggage, no?

1:15:13.540 --> 1:15:16.310
[chuckles]

1:15:16.510 --> 1:15:18.140
I'm going to the bathroom.

1:15:19.140 --> 1:15:20.510
Okay.

1:15:24.220 --> 1:15:25.980
She's so lovely.

1:15:26.320 --> 1:15:27.390
Lovely.

1:15:27.590 --> 1:15:28.690
And how long
are you staying here?

1:15:28.920 --> 1:15:30.820
Just tonight.
Came here for the birthday.

1:15:31.020 --> 1:15:33.260
Great,
it means a lot to your sister.

1:15:33.460 --> 1:15:34.890
Yeah, I know.

1:15:35.090 --> 1:15:37.930
How's your lobby life?

1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:40.130
I'm the junior manager now.

1:15:40.330 --> 1:15:42.070
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1:15:42.270 --> 1:15:44.500
- A promotion?
- A while ago.

1:15:45.940 --> 1:15:48.170
Great. [chuckles]

1:15:49.110 --> 1:15:52.210
Let me help you.
I can invest in your business.

1:15:52.410 --> 1:15:54.010
I don't need you to.

1:15:54.210 --> 1:15:55.610
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

1:15:56.010 --> 1:15:57.520
Thanks.

1:15:57.820 --> 1:15:58.620
Okay.

1:15:58.880 --> 1:16:00.550
Do me a favor?

1:16:01.120 --> 1:16:04.620
Be nice to my fiancée.

1:16:04.890 --> 1:16:07.430
Can you speak English?
She doesn't speak Spanish.

1:16:08.530 --> 1:16:09.960
- Okay.
- It's fine.

1:16:10.160 --> 1:16:12.530
She's so cute! [chuckles]

1:16:15.530 --> 1:16:17.220
You survived!

1:16:17.420 --> 1:16:19.140
Yeah, thanks to you.

1:16:20.270 --> 1:16:22.540
- He's intense.
- He's an asshole.

1:16:26.210 --> 1:16:28.250
This house! This house,
you were saying, it's...

1:16:28.450 --> 1:16:30.150
it's this architect.

1:16:30.480 --> 1:16:31.820
Luis Barragán.

1:16:32.020 --> 1:16:34.050
It was gonna be built
a bit differently

1:16:34.250 --> 1:16:35.590
and she doesn't like
me to say it,

1:16:35.790 --> 1:16:39.220
but she had like a flirtatious
relationship with him.

1:16:39.420 --> 1:16:42.230
- Oh!
- And one of the rooms...

1:16:42.430 --> 1:16:46.060
- The thing you told us.
- Shut up! That's a secret.

1:16:46.930 --> 1:16:48.170
[laughter]

1:16:48.570 --> 1:16:50.090
Having fun?

1:16:50.280 --> 1:16:53.200
Our little wonderful
dysfunctional family.

1:16:53.810 --> 1:16:57.310
So much fun. It's amazing you
guys managed to stay friends.

1:16:57.510 --> 1:17:00.340
We're friends because
we were never in love,

1:17:00.550 --> 1:17:02.180
but we love our kids.

1:17:02.380 --> 1:17:05.320
She doesn't need to hear
the whole family story, that's...

1:17:05.520 --> 1:17:08.090
I would love to hear
the whole family story.

1:17:08.290 --> 1:17:11.420
- Where is the bathroom?
- Spanish?

1:17:12.320 --> 1:17:16.030
- Down the hall, to the right.
- Thank you.

1:17:18.100 --> 1:17:19.730
She's beautiful.

1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:21.930
I'm in love with this man.

1:17:22.130 --> 1:17:24.270
(Wait, his odd)
(douchebag father?)

1:17:25.270 --> 1:17:27.300
Alejandro, not the dad.

1:17:27.510 --> 1:17:31.040
(Oh, my god. This is such a relief)
(to hear because I was deeply sad)

1:17:31.240 --> 1:17:33.340
(when we got the "New York)
(or Nowhere" news. I was like:)

1:17:33.540 --> 1:17:35.310
(This is not the kind of news)
(you want to hear when you're)

1:17:35.510 --> 1:17:37.980
(on your proverbial honeymoon)
(with the hot hotel guy.)

1:17:41.290 --> 1:17:42.620
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

1:17:42.890 --> 1:17:44.490
(Chris didn't tell you?)
(Perfect.)

1:17:44.890 --> 1:17:46.760
(Yeah, um, we didn't)
(get the movie.)

1:17:47.130 --> 1:17:48.460
(I'm so sorry.)

1:17:48.990 --> 1:17:50.760
How long will the romance
with the star last?

1:17:51.030 --> 1:17:52.330
Alejandro, be optimistic.

1:17:53.360 --> 1:17:54.470
Please.

1:17:54.670 --> 1:17:57.900
They're young.
She is a famous star.

1:17:58.100 --> 1:17:59.240
A millionaire.

1:17:59.440 --> 1:18:00.710
How much do you make
a month at your job?

1:18:00.970 --> 1:18:02.310
- Don't listen to him.
- Here we go.

1:18:02.510 --> 1:18:03.670
No, come on.

1:18:03.910 --> 1:18:05.610
He is...

1:18:06.040 --> 1:18:07.780
They gave it to someone else.

1:18:07.980 --> 1:18:11.250
[Rachel] (I know, I know, you
were) (robbed. Movies are not
life.)

1:18:11.450 --> 1:18:14.320
(Love is life. And you and)
(Alejandro are clearly in love.)

1:18:14.520 --> 1:18:15.450
Okay.

1:18:15.650 --> 1:18:16.950
- How much do you earn?
- Son.

1:18:17.160 --> 1:18:19.260
Do you know what will happen
to her in her next job

1:18:19.460 --> 1:18:21.760
when she falls in love
with the protagonist

1:18:21.990 --> 1:18:23.490
or the antagonist?
That's how they are.

1:18:23.690 --> 1:18:26.360
You have to focus
on what you must do.

1:18:26.560 --> 1:18:28.330
[Rachel] (I am so happy for
you.) (Can you let yourself)

1:18:28.530 --> 1:18:31.200
(be happy for you, for once?)
(I love you. Go enjoy.)

1:18:31.400 --> 1:18:33.270
- I love you.
[Rachel] (-Okay, bye girl.)

1:18:39.680 --> 1:18:42.050
Just because you do that,
doesn't mean she will.

1:18:42.250 --> 1:18:43.510
- I do that?
- What's the number

1:18:43.710 --> 1:18:44.950
- of this marriage?
- Honey.

1:18:45.150 --> 1:18:47.050
- Four right?
- Do you love her?

1:18:47.250 --> 1:18:48.620
We're talking about you.
It's always about you.

1:18:48.820 --> 1:18:51.460
- What do you expect from her?
- She is just a tourist.

1:18:59.630 --> 1:19:01.200
- Hey.
- Hi.

1:19:04.300 --> 1:19:05.470
What's wrong?

1:19:05.670 --> 1:19:07.170
Nothing.

1:19:07.610 --> 1:19:11.010
Oh, no, I just found out I didn't
book "New York or Nowhere".

1:19:12.610 --> 1:19:14.750
I'm sorry to hear that.
You know what?

1:19:15.050 --> 1:19:16.450
It wasn't meant to be.

1:19:16.650 --> 1:19:19.750
No, it's okay, it's the sudden
strike, it's a heartbreak.

1:19:19.980 --> 1:19:20.720
Perks of the job.

1:19:23.350 --> 1:19:24.620
Yeah.

1:19:24.820 --> 1:19:28.730
So, what are you gonna
do next after all this?

1:19:30.560 --> 1:19:31.830
After all this?

1:19:32.060 --> 1:19:34.100
Yeah, like, when you're
done with the movie.

1:19:35.700 --> 1:19:37.640
Uh...

1:19:38.070 --> 1:19:39.800
Uh, I don't know.

1:19:40.070 --> 1:19:43.670
I don't know. Go on a trip.
Or something. I guess.

1:19:46.140 --> 1:19:48.280
Sorry, I think I missed
something.

1:19:48.480 --> 1:19:51.420
Did you just tell your dad
that I'm just a tourist?

1:19:53.750 --> 1:19:55.450
I was joking.

1:19:58.420 --> 1:20:01.790
Okay, well, let me know how
much I owe you for the services.

1:20:02.430 --> 1:20:05.300
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's a joke.

1:20:07.330 --> 1:20:09.270
Anything else you wanna say?

1:20:11.700 --> 1:20:13.240
No.

1:20:14.110 --> 1:20:18.410
[indistinct chatter]

1:20:27.550 --> 1:20:30.190
I feel like such an idiot.
Why am I here?

1:20:30.450 --> 1:20:32.190
You could've told me
if you didn't want me to come.

1:20:32.390 --> 1:20:33.820
You invited yourself.

1:20:42.830 --> 1:20:45.400
Okay, so, I'm sorry, I just...

1:20:45.600 --> 1:20:47.810
This is just a thing you do,
you take girls out

1:20:48.070 --> 1:20:50.210
and you show them how to
squeeze lime on everything

1:20:50.410 --> 1:20:52.340
- and then you sleep with them?
- Sophie, calm down.

1:20:52.540 --> 1:20:55.150
- Calm down?
- Yeah. You're acting a bit...

1:20:55.350 --> 1:20:56.680
Crazy?

1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:02.890
Sorry, I just think I'm realizing
that you might be full of shit.

1:21:03.420 --> 1:21:06.320
[Monica] The photo.

1:21:06.660 --> 1:21:08.460
[Daniela] Photo.

1:21:08.730 --> 1:21:10.490
[Grandma] The photo!

1:21:10.860 --> 1:21:13.600
[indistinct chatter]

1:21:13.800 --> 1:21:15.570
[Sebastian] Photo, come on!

1:21:16.500 --> 1:21:17.840
[Sebastian] Photo!

1:21:20.840 --> 1:21:23.040
I'm full of shit?

1:21:23.710 --> 1:21:26.510
You're in a fake relationship
with someone, Sophie.

1:21:26.710 --> 1:21:28.810
Now is just your little fantasy.

1:21:29.080 --> 1:21:31.520
- My little fantasy?
- Yeah, but that's what you do

1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:34.220
because actors play pretend.
And that's okay.

1:21:34.420 --> 1:21:36.690
I was very, very clear
from the very beginning.

1:21:36.890 --> 1:21:39.560
I was focused on my career
and I thought you were too.

1:21:42.390 --> 1:21:44.430
You never go after
what you want!

1:21:44.630 --> 1:21:46.800
And you have no idea
what you deserve.

1:21:47.270 --> 1:21:49.500
And you do?

1:21:52.870 --> 1:21:54.810
I thought I did.

1:21:56.570 --> 1:21:59.740
[indistinct chatter]

1:21:59.940 --> 1:22:02.450
[Daniela] Alejandro, come!
We're ready for the photo.

1:22:02.650 --> 1:22:04.580
A photo, yeah!

1:22:04.820 --> 1:22:06.420
[Daniela] -Come!
[Sebastian] -Come now!

1:22:06.620 --> 1:22:07.820
[Alejandro senior] Come!

1:22:08.450 --> 1:22:09.420
Come now!

1:22:09.720 --> 1:22:10.790
Here.

1:22:11.720 --> 1:22:13.890
One, two, three!

1:22:14.730 --> 1:22:20.430
[romantic music]

1:22:27.240 --> 1:22:31.440
[sound of waves]

1:22:31.640 --> 1:22:33.280
SOPHIE WILDER CHEATS ON
ADAM CLARK WITH HOTEL EMPLOYEE!

1:22:34.880 --> 1:22:37.720
- What will I do without you?
- Aurelia, it was a mistake!

1:22:37.950 --> 1:22:39.180
I'm sorry.

1:22:40.580 --> 1:22:43.020
- I don't want to lose you.
- Then don't!

1:22:43.220 --> 1:22:44.620
You should have thought
of that before

1:22:44.820 --> 1:22:46.620
going off and being all horny.

1:22:47.430 --> 1:22:49.590
What about New York?
That was the plan.

1:22:49.790 --> 1:22:51.960
- You can't do this to me.
- Ah, plans...

1:22:52.360 --> 1:22:53.660
Your plans.

1:22:55.270 --> 1:22:59.970
Well, now your plan can be
to go run away with your artist.

1:23:00.670 --> 1:23:02.810
- No, that's done now.
- What do you mean "it's done"?

1:23:03.010 --> 1:23:04.410
It's over.

1:23:04.740 --> 1:23:07.550
I can't believe
you're such a coward!

1:23:12.350 --> 1:23:14.890
My powers are gone but it's me.

1:23:23.230 --> 1:23:25.100
[director] Shake
the puppet more.

1:23:25.560 --> 1:23:28.000
More. Shake the puppet.

1:23:28.970 --> 1:23:30.870
I missed you!

1:23:39.810 --> 1:23:43.410
(So today "Super Society" finally)
(finished filming in Mexico.)

1:23:43.610 --> 1:23:45.680
(And you're gonna wanna brace)
(yourself for this one because)

1:23:45.880 --> 1:23:49.650
(we just got word that Adam Clark)
(has broken up with Sophie Wilder.)

1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:54.530
Shit!

1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:00.600
I'm in love.

1:24:00.800 --> 1:24:03.500
- What will you do about it?
- What do you mean?

1:24:03.700 --> 1:24:05.000
She hates me!

1:24:05.200 --> 1:24:08.570

don't let fear stop you.

1:24:08.770 --> 1:24:09.910
Come on!

1:24:10.110 --> 1:24:13.780
Just text her and apologize.
That's it.

1:24:14.040 --> 1:24:17.050
A text message?
Are you insane?

1:24:17.920 --> 1:24:19.820
Write her a letter.

Then you burn it
and blow it in the wind.

1:24:26.020 --> 1:24:27.830
She'll find it.

1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:39.840

1:24:55.050 --> 1:24:57.870
Yes, I need your help.

Go, go, go.
I'll take care of the plate.

1:24:59.640 --> 1:25:01.160

Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?

Are you doing the scene

1:26:00.650 --> 1:26:02.520
I'm trying to,

1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:03.950
- I can't help you.
- Please.

No, no, no, I can't help you.
I'm mad at you.

No, I can't.

- No, no, you're not stupid.

1:26:13.860 --> 1:26:15.630
You made my friend happier

- No!

Do you love her 'cuz she's good
in bed?

1:26:21.870 --> 1:26:24.170
- Yes! No! Why do you know that?
- A woman knows.

1:26:24.410 --> 1:26:25.880
Why do you love her?

1:26:26.140 --> 1:26:29.650
I love her 'cuz she's the best
thing that I never planned for

1:26:29.850 --> 1:26:32.620
and because she makes me
want to be a better man.

1:26:32.880 --> 1:26:34.850
That was really good.

1:26:35.150 --> 1:26:38.820
Okay, if I was looking for her
I'd think she was about to do

1:26:39.020 --> 1:26:40.920
the scene where she does
the do do and the da da

1:26:41.130 --> 1:26:42.930

know. I never read the scripts.

1:26:43.130 --> 1:26:44.860

1:37:31.140 --> 1:37:34.610
I love dancing.
Let's see it.

1:37:36.210 --> 1:37:38.150
- Right now?
- Yeah.

1:37:38.820 --> 1:37:39.650
Okay.

1:37:39.850 --> 1:37:41.120
I have to go and tell Joe.

1:37:41.420 --> 1:37:44.540
She doesn't have the rights
to remix "Who Let the Dogs Out".

1:37:44.740 --> 1:37:48.460
And I said, if not her, who?
Who, who, who?

1:37:49.430 --> 1:37:51.460
- Yeah?
- Sure, okay.

1:37:53.830 --> 1:37:57.940
[dancing music]

1:37:58.240 --> 1:38:00.200
[chuckles] Okay!

1:38:05.510 --> 1:38:06.680
Oh!

1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:08.810
My goodness! Wow!

1:38:16.620 --> 1:38:18.520
I'm speechless. Speechless.

1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:20.240
Thank you! Cheers!

1:38:20.440 --> 1:38:21.260
Yeah.

1:38:21.460 --> 1:38:21.620
