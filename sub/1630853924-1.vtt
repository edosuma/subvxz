WEBVTT

04:33.816 --> 04:35.415
Let me see that.

04:38.449 --> 04:40.987
Babe, I'm really tired.

04:41.056 --> 04:43.623
Please, I just wanna rest.

04:43.691 --> 04:47.689
I've been out there for days.
Babe, please come on.

04:47.757 --> 04:49.129
-Come rest with me.
-Come on.

04:49.198 --> 04:50.793
Just give me a moment.
Okay?

08:13.067 --> 08:14.260
Land!

08:52.241 --> 08:54.407
Have some wine with me.

08:54.476 --> 08:56.076
Okay, I'll
go in a minute.

08:56.144 --> 08:57.809
Bottle of reds.

08:59.147 --> 09:00.240
Bottle of red.

09:01.345 --> 09:02.880
Come on.

09:05.983 --> 09:08.316
We're almost there.
Couple more days.

09:08.384 --> 09:12.157
I feel like I really just
wanna get there, you know?

09:12.226 --> 09:14.891
I hear you.

09:14.960 --> 09:18.298
I say that I think you
really need like a break

09:18.367 --> 09:20.031
and I say we're right here.

09:20.100 --> 09:23.837
Why don't we take one day
off and just relax onshore?

09:23.906 --> 09:26.367
-No--
-Why keep on
making this eternal?

09:26.436 --> 09:29.740
-It's like the eternal trip--
-No, it's not that, baby--

09:29.809 --> 09:31.576
The eternal
trip to nowhere.

09:31.645 --> 09:32.975
No, come on.
Don't say that.

09:33.044 --> 09:34.910
-Come here.
-Well, it seems like that.

09:34.979 --> 09:36.778
Have some wine with me.
Come here.

09:36.847 --> 09:38.880
For going to the island.

09:38.948 --> 09:40.383
Yes, we're gonna
go to an island.

09:40.452 --> 09:42.187
Nice. Really?

09:42.256 --> 09:43.656
But not this one.

09:43.725 --> 09:45.588
-Come on.
-Come on, we're right here.

09:45.656 --> 09:47.188
Baby, we have a plan--

09:47.256 --> 09:48.760
-I don't want to have wine.
-We're gonna

09:48.829 --> 09:50.759
hit Easter Island.
It's gonna be beautiful.

09:50.828 --> 09:51.858
We're gonna have good surf.

09:51.926 --> 09:53.799
We're gonna have sun.

09:56.401 --> 10:00.338
Christian, Easter Island is too,
too much time.
I wanna stay here.

10:00.407 --> 10:05.072
They call these islands
the Islands of Despair,
the islands--

10:05.141 --> 10:07.842
This is the boat
of despair for me.

10:07.911 --> 10:11.317
The Islands of Despair, Domi.

10:11.385 --> 10:12.717
We're gonna go on a rock?

10:12.786 --> 10:14.380
The Islands of Despair?
Come on.

10:14.449 --> 10:15.916
You don't stop at the
Islands of Despair.

10:15.985 --> 10:17.216
Hey, don't raise your voice,

10:17.285 --> 10:18.757
-I'm right here.
-I'm just saying--

10:18.826 --> 10:20.188
-I'm right here.
-It's kind of funny.

10:20.257 --> 10:21.994
You don't stop on the
Islands of Despair.

10:22.062 --> 10:24.957
You go past the Islands of
Despair to paradise, Domi.

10:26.734 --> 10:28.601
Domi?
What are you getting up now?

10:28.670 --> 10:30.665
Now you're talking
Spanish to me.

10:30.734 --> 10:32.836
-I don't understand Spanish.
-I don't feel
like drinking wine.

10:32.905 --> 10:34.666
You know, what are
we celebrating?

10:34.735 --> 10:37.936
That we are staying here
forever and ever in this boat?

10:38.005 --> 10:40.005
-This is always
the case with you.
-Come on, we are right here.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.707
It's a tiny little dingy.

10:41.776 --> 10:46.312
We just have to row for five
minutes and we're in a beach.

10:46.381 --> 10:50.086
I made a plan and we
stick to the plan. Okay?

10:50.154 --> 10:51.825
I'm gonna have us on
a beach that's warm.

10:51.894 --> 10:53.593
-I'm not part of this plan?
-Where I can surf--

10:53.662 --> 10:55.256
-I'm not part?
-Where you can scuba dive

10:55.324 --> 10:56.595
-and we can have a great time.
-Who am I?

10:56.663 --> 10:57.995
-I wanna know--
-No, no!

10:58.063 --> 10:59.692
-I don't wanna hear you.
-Hey, shut the fuck up.

10:59.761 --> 11:02.631
-Just shut up for a second.
-You are so selfish, you know?

11:02.700 --> 11:04.834
So selfish all the time.

11:04.903 --> 11:06.571
What do you mean?
We're right here.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.235
We can get down.
We can relax.

11:08.304 --> 11:10.909
You know, you never look
at the bright picture.

11:10.977 --> 11:12.339
You're always negative
about everything.

11:12.407 --> 11:14.247
Domi, the answer is
no, we don't stop here.

11:14.316 --> 11:16.375
Well, fuck you then.

11:16.444 --> 11:20.050
Domi, it doesn't
have to be a fight.

11:21.255 --> 11:22.648
Come here.

11:22.717 --> 11:24.418
I understand that it
doesn't have to be a fight.

11:24.487 --> 11:27.761
That's why I'm suggesting
let's just stay here one night.

11:27.829 --> 11:29.923
-Okay, look--
-Let's take a walk.

11:29.992 --> 11:31.990
Let's watch the sunset.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.532
Let's, you know...

11:33.601 --> 11:36.429
I hear what you're saying.

11:38.601 --> 11:39.637
So?

11:39.706 --> 11:41.440
But we're not gonna stay here.

11:41.508 --> 11:42.908
That's the final word.

11:42.977 --> 11:45.176
But why not?
Just because you don't want to?

11:45.244 --> 11:47.347
It's not because I don't want
to. It's not in our plan.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.644
We have a plan to get
on a schedule
to the place that we're going,

11:49.713 --> 11:51.579
-where it's nice and warm.
-What schedule?
What schedule?

11:51.648 --> 11:53.048
Domi, don't make
everything
a fucking argument.

11:53.116 --> 11:54.814
This is a year.
What schedule?

11:54.882 --> 11:57.522
-I don't understand.
-Don't make everything
an argument.

11:57.590 --> 11:59.024
I don't wanna keep saying

11:59.092 --> 12:00.052
-the same thing--
-I don't wanna talk to you.

12:01.489 --> 12:03.697
No, don't start
talking Spanish, Domi.

12:03.766 --> 12:05.992
Don't say no.
Who are you to say no?

12:06.061 --> 12:08.867
No. I say no.
No.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.296
That's why
I'm talking Spanish,

12:10.365 --> 12:11.769
'cause I can't
believe you shout--

12:11.838 --> 12:13.135
Oh, you make me
so fucking angry.

12:13.204 --> 12:15.639
I said, no, we're not
stopping on this island.

12:17.546 --> 12:19.104
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

13:33.620 --> 13:34.552
<i> We don't stop.</i>

13:34.621 --> 13:35.751
<i>We don't stop.</i>

13:35.820 --> 13:37.523
<i>We don't stop.</i>

13:37.592 --> 13:39.623
<i>It's a fucking rock.</i>

13:39.692 --> 13:41.658
<i>We don't stop.</i>

13:41.727 --> 13:43.155
<i>We don't stop.</i>

13:43.224 --> 13:44.826
<i>It's a fucking rock.</i>

13:44.895 --> 13:46.295
<i>Listen to me.</i>

Domi!

17:58.784 --> 18:00.318
Domi!

18:05.626 --> 18:06.720
Domi!

18:14.030 --> 18:15.663
Domi!

18:38.785 --> 18:42.156
Indian shit.
This is from her, right?

18:42.225 --> 18:45.693
The pothead, travel around
the world on my dime,
wannabe artist.

18:47.829 --> 18:49.667
You know, maybe if
you weren't jealous,

18:49.736 --> 18:51.334
you wouldn't be saying that
kind of stuff about my wife--

18:51.403 --> 18:53.033
This has got nothing
to do with me.

18:53.102 --> 18:55.637
I'm fine on my own.
Better even.
This is about you.

18:55.706 --> 18:57.408
You know you had your
time traveling around,

18:57.477 --> 19:00.041
living like fucking gypsies.
I supported it.

19:00.110 --> 19:02.646
Now you're back here.
You're doing the work.
You're doing a great job.

19:02.714 --> 19:04.645
It's great having you here,
but you got to keep that focus.

19:04.714 --> 19:06.252
What the hell's the
matter with you?

19:06.320 --> 19:08.147
-No. I'm fine, dad.
-You're fine?

19:08.216 --> 19:09.382
Yeah.

19:09.451 --> 19:10.883
<i> You're not fine.</i>

19:12.792 --> 19:14.392
Hello!

19:16.026 --> 19:17.659
Hello!

19:24.331 --> 19:27.969
Hello!

19:28.038 --> 19:29.836
Domi!

19:31.140 --> 19:32.740
Domi!

19:35.210 --> 19:36.645
Domi!

19:55.362 --> 19:57.303
Domi!

20:05.606 --> 20:07.478
It's incredible really.

20:08.717 --> 20:10.279
You're stubborn.

20:10.348 --> 20:12.516
No connection with reality.

20:29.100 --> 20:30.699
Hello!

21:07.434 --> 21:09.672
Domi!

21:16.582 --> 21:20.381
If you're going to
do this, do it right.

21:20.449 --> 21:21.854
Chart everything out.

21:21.923 --> 21:23.451
Stick with the plan.

21:23.520 --> 21:24.551
Don't take any stupid risks.

21:24.620 --> 21:26.723
People die every day at sea.

21:26.792 --> 21:29.020
I got it all charted, Dad.
It's gonna be amazing.

21:29.089 --> 21:30.959
Yeah? I didn't get to
the most important part.

21:31.027 --> 21:35.565
On a boat there's one captain
just like normal life.

21:35.634 --> 21:38.465
It's essential that this
woman knows her place.

21:38.533 --> 21:40.833
It's just primal, son.

21:40.902 --> 21:43.572
You establish
yourself the leader.

21:43.641 --> 21:44.936
Right now she
thinks she's got you

21:45.005 --> 21:47.609
wrapped around
her little finger.

21:47.678 --> 21:49.944
You gotta be strong.
Don't back down.

21:50.013 --> 21:53.478
She keeps up with this bullshit
just throw her overboard.

22:10.563 --> 22:13.438
Domi!

22:13.507 --> 22:16.101
Domi, I see the boat.
Where are you?

22:21.510 --> 22:23.346
Domi, I see the tent.

22:23.415 --> 22:25.312
Domi this is not fucking funny.

22:25.380 --> 22:26.615
Come here.

22:26.683 --> 22:29.851
Go away from here.
Don't come here.

22:29.919 --> 22:31.689
Get back in the boat.
This is not funny.

22:31.757 --> 22:35.221
-This is not safe.
-No. I want you to go away.

22:35.290 --> 22:37.089
Get out.

22:37.157 --> 22:39.097
Domi, you have to
come back to the boat.

22:39.166 --> 22:40.626
This is very dangerous.

22:42.937 --> 22:44.001
I'm staying here.

22:44.070 --> 22:45.167
I'm not going.

22:45.235 --> 22:47.066
Fuck!

23:24.542 --> 23:27.040
Get out.
What are doing?

23:31.546 --> 23:33.486
Don't come here.

23:36.389 --> 23:37.682
Why don't you listen to me?

23:37.751 --> 23:39.083
I'm saying go away.

23:39.152 --> 23:40.954
Do you know how
dangerous this is?

23:41.023 --> 23:44.090
Stop it.
I don't want you to come here.

23:46.132 --> 23:47.995
Don't come here.

23:48.063 --> 23:51.070
Domi, you have to get the
fuck back on the boat.

23:51.138 --> 23:54.537
What don't you understand?
I'm saying I don't
want to see you here.

23:54.606 --> 23:56.771
This is my place.
I came here.

23:56.840 --> 23:59.311
I left the boat.
That fucking boat.

23:59.380 --> 24:01.377
-Domi, listen to me.
-No. No.

24:01.446 --> 24:02.643
-Listen to me.
-No.

24:02.712 --> 24:04.642
You made me leave that boat.

24:04.711 --> 24:06.083
I can't anymore.

24:06.152 --> 24:07.086
This is my place.

24:07.154 --> 24:08.881
I want you to go away.

24:08.949 --> 24:10.553
-Listen to me.
-No.

24:10.622 --> 24:12.617
Listen to me, Domi.
Please.

24:12.686 --> 24:14.187
I love you. Okay?

24:14.256 --> 24:16.727
-Is that what you wanna hear?
-No. Get outta here.

24:16.796 --> 24:19.163
-Domi, don't fucking hit me!
-Don't say that.

24:19.231 --> 24:21.064
Don't say that.

24:21.133 --> 24:23.668
-Don't say that.
-What is your problem?
Don't hit me.

24:23.737 --> 24:26.869
Who you think you are
saying I love you now?

24:26.938 --> 24:30.837
When I've been calling
for you since months.

24:30.906 --> 24:33.005
-Domi.
-Get out of here.

24:33.074 --> 24:34.646
-You want me to leave?
-Go away.

24:34.715 --> 24:36.109
-You want me to leave?
-Yes, I want you to.

24:36.178 --> 24:38.512
Fine, I'll leave you
on this fucking island.

24:38.581 --> 24:40.520
-Yes.
-Fine.

25:33.741 --> 25:35.941
I can't take you seriously
with that haircut.

25:36.010 --> 25:39.043
You gotta get your money back
from whoever did that to you.

25:39.112 --> 25:41.643
What is it anyway?
I mean, are you
trying to cover up

25:41.712 --> 25:43.010
your bald spot or something?

25:43.079 --> 25:44.913
-Dad, it's just a style.
-It's not a style.

25:44.982 --> 25:46.881
It's half a haircut.
It's half short.

25:46.949 --> 25:48.580
It's half long.
It's half man.

25:48.649 --> 25:52.284
It's half woman.
It's half gay.
It's half military.

25:52.353 --> 25:54.788
It's everything that's
wrong with this world.

25:54.857 --> 25:56.355
I don't know about all that.

25:56.424 --> 25:58.193
You just let it go,
naturally, like your old man.

25:58.261 --> 26:02.866
You know, balding is a sign
of strong testosterone.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.166
It's your move.

26:43.270 --> 26:44.809
I'm looking
at old pictures

26:44.877 --> 26:47.680
and it gets me so
horny when I see them.

26:50.981 --> 26:52.615
Look, I've
gotta get to work.

26:52.684 --> 26:53.912
We can do this another time.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.518
But take the morning.

26:55.587 --> 26:57.522
Stay with me a little bit.

26:57.591 --> 26:59.454
I wish.
I can't, love.

26:59.522 --> 27:00.825
I'm sorry.

27:40.230 --> 27:42.029
You wanna hear an
interesting thing, Dad?

27:42.098 --> 27:43.694
Back when pilgrims
first came here,

27:43.763 --> 27:46.605
you know, before this was
the America we know and love.

27:46.674 --> 27:48.204
First invaded
here, I should say,

27:48.272 --> 27:50.441
'cause they did invade here.
There were cases where,

27:50.510 --> 27:52.712
you know, some of the
Native Americans went
and lived with the Whites,

27:52.780 --> 27:54.109
you know, and took
on their way of life.

27:54.177 --> 27:56.209
And there were also cases
where Native Americans

27:56.278 --> 27:58.515
somehow or another
ended up with the...

27:58.583 --> 28:00.217
Or what am I saying here?

28:00.286 --> 28:02.086
There were cases where Whites
somehow or another ended up

28:02.155 --> 28:04.082
with the Native Americans,
you know, living off the land,

28:04.151 --> 28:07.423
all feral and shit. In teepees.

28:07.492 --> 28:08.892
You follow me?

28:08.961 --> 28:11.295
Are you going to fucking
move some time today?

28:11.364 --> 28:12.659
There you go.

28:12.728 --> 28:13.960
That was weak.

28:14.029 --> 28:16.327
Native Americans called Indians.

28:16.395 --> 28:18.368
Don't start with
this PC bullshit.

28:18.437 --> 28:20.604
Well, my point is this, right?
The Indians, when
given the chance,

28:20.673 --> 28:22.100
ran back to their old life.

28:22.169 --> 28:24.436
Not a question, no hesitation.

28:24.504 --> 28:26.571
But the Whites, it
was a different story.

28:26.639 --> 28:30.141
<i>They stayed with the</i>
<i>so-called savages.</i>

28:30.210 --> 28:32.143
<i>They gave up their way of life.</i>

28:32.212 --> 28:34.083
<i>You don't find that crazy?</i>

28:46.467 --> 28:47.800
<i> You been surfing?</i>

28:50.365 --> 28:52.136
I mean, I haven't
been getting out. No.

28:52.205 --> 28:53.869
You know, when the surf's up,
you can come in later any time.

28:53.937 --> 28:56.302
-You know that.
-I know.

28:56.371 --> 28:58.136
Jesus, guy doesn't even
want to surf.

28:58.205 --> 29:00.813
She's got you so twisted up.

29:03.615 --> 29:05.210
Women, women, women.

29:05.279 --> 29:07.618
Jesus.
Come on, I need a smoke.

29:07.687 --> 29:10.584
It's checkmate in five anyway.

29:10.653 --> 29:11.885
Whatever.

29:11.954 --> 29:13.925
Yeah, whatever's right.

29:21.635 --> 29:22.999
<i> Do you just want me to go?</i>

29:23.068 --> 29:25.332
You're not going anywhere.
Just relax.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.941
I got wisdom for you.
I mean it.

29:31.678 --> 29:33.608
Just listen to your old man.

29:33.677 --> 29:35.045
I'm listening.

29:38.948 --> 29:40.578
I love you.
All right?

29:43.017 --> 29:46.483
This business is for you.

29:46.552 --> 29:48.124
But you've gotta
stay in your lane.

29:48.193 --> 29:50.496
When you take over you
make the big money.

29:50.565 --> 29:52.260
Create a life for yourself.

29:52.329 --> 29:55.364
That sound like a plan
you should stick with?

29:55.433 --> 29:56.929
Yes?

29:56.998 --> 29:58.633
Yeah, I guess. Yeah.

29:58.701 --> 29:59.798
Yes, what?

29:59.867 --> 30:01.067
Yes, sir.

30:01.136 --> 30:02.401
And we can't have this woman

30:02.470 --> 30:05.838
fucking that up
with her crazy shit.

30:05.907 --> 30:07.710
Let's drop it.

30:07.778 --> 30:09.882
Yeah, enough already.

31:44.006 --> 31:46.709
Hey, you still got that?

31:46.777 --> 31:48.675
Oh, yeah, yeah.

31:48.743 --> 31:51.777
Reminds me when we were kids.
Takes me back to the sea.

31:51.845 --> 31:56.581
And you know, with all this
craziness, it calms me.

31:56.650 --> 31:59.354
-You gotta get that?
-Oh, God. Yeah.

31:59.423 --> 32:01.658
I mean, I should.
You know, it's a work day.

32:01.727 --> 32:03.628
You know how that...

32:03.697 --> 32:05.328
How often are you here?

32:05.396 --> 32:07.364
<i> I'm worried</i>
<i>about your brother.</i>

32:07.433 --> 32:10.968
<i>This woman, she's bringing</i>
<i>him down, big time.</i>

32:11.037 --> 32:14.139
<i> Yeah, well, he</i>
<i>married an Argentine Taurus,</i>
<i>so what do you expect?</i>

32:14.208 --> 32:15.768
<i> I just feel like</i>
<i>I'm on borrowed time</i>

32:15.837 --> 32:17.571
<i>before she starts screwing</i>
<i>with his head again.</i>

32:17.639 --> 32:20.073
I mean, you're better
off on your own, right?

32:20.141 --> 32:21.508
No question.

32:21.577 --> 32:23.642
And you got the gift
of the golden tongue.

32:23.711 --> 32:24.944
-See, I need you to talk to him.

32:25.013 --> 32:26.885
Set him straight.

32:26.954 --> 32:28.847
I mean, you know, you're
set up here great.

32:28.915 --> 32:31.990
I'm really proud of you,
but I want him to take over

32:32.059 --> 32:34.521
the business from,
you know, from me.

32:41.964 --> 32:43.427
<i>She's gotta go.</i>

32:43.496 --> 32:45.267
<i>He's gotta get rid of her.</i>

32:45.336 --> 32:48.273
I'm calling it
Operation Dismiss Domi.

32:48.342 --> 32:49.536
Come on.

32:49.605 --> 32:51.975
No, I'm dead serious.
I need you in on this.

32:52.044 --> 32:53.810
Ah, Dad.
I don't know.

32:53.879 --> 32:56.047
<i>You don't know what?</i>

32:56.116 --> 32:59.451
Bottom line is she's got
his head all fucked up

32:59.519 --> 33:02.817
and I am not leaving
here until you promise me
you'll talk to him.

36:02.533 --> 36:04.296
All right.
Food's almost up, guys.

36:04.365 --> 36:05.699
Make yourselves at home.

36:13.946 --> 36:16.279
All right, food's up.

36:16.348 --> 36:18.613
Come on, Dad.
Look at this plate.

36:24.956 --> 36:26.357
Have a seat.

36:29.292 --> 36:31.428
That looks good,<i> amor.</i>

36:32.660 --> 36:34.298
-We're missing the wine.
-Ah, I got it.

36:34.367 --> 36:35.629
I got it. I got it.
No, no. Sit, sit.

36:35.698 --> 36:37.500
It's in the car,
I'll be right back.

37:53.111 --> 37:56.181
Dad, what happened?

37:56.250 --> 37:59.314
I don't know.
She just got up and left.

37:59.383 --> 38:00.986
I'm not sure what happened.

38:01.055 --> 38:02.220
That steak's really good though.

38:02.288 --> 38:03.481
You should sit down.
Let's eat.

40:23.790 --> 40:26.791
<i> Domi packed up, Dad.</i>

40:26.860 --> 40:29.193
<i>Left me for South America.</i>

40:33.303 --> 40:34.371
You smiling, Dad?

40:34.439 --> 40:36.337
-That's my wife.
-No, no. I know.

40:36.405 --> 40:37.773
I know. I know.

40:37.842 --> 40:42.943
But maybe, just maybe
it's for the better.

40:51.952 --> 40:54.658
-Dad, it's 10.
-Fuck it.

40:54.727 --> 40:56.126
<i>Look, I know you're</i>
<i>hurting, man.</i>

40:56.194 --> 40:57.326
<i>I know that.</i>

40:57.395 --> 40:59.256
<i>But time will heal you.</i>

40:59.324 --> 41:01.599
<i>Just gotta get</i>
<i>back on the horse.</i>

41:41.974 --> 41:44.935
Listen, son, Operation Dismiss
Domi is almost complete.

41:45.004 --> 41:46.776
She took off for South America.

41:46.844 --> 41:49.106
But I really need you to
call your brother ASAP.

41:49.175 --> 41:51.148
That's an order.
All hands on deck.

41:51.217 --> 41:52.584
Keep him on point.

41:52.653 --> 41:53.981
You don't want him
doing something stupid,

41:54.049 --> 41:55.647
you know, like leaving
the country or something.

41:55.716 --> 41:57.081
So give him a call.

41:57.150 --> 41:59.288
We've almost got
him away from her.

41:59.357 --> 42:00.889
Talk to you later.

43:59.044 --> 44:00.905
<i> I'm telling you,</i>
<i>man, it's for the best.</i>

44:00.974 --> 44:02.340
<i> You think? Really?</i>

44:02.409 --> 44:03.745
<i> She was</i>
<i>driving you crazy.</i>

44:03.814 --> 44:04.843
<i>You know, she was relentless.</i>

44:04.912 --> 44:06.345
<i>It was time to move on.</i>

44:06.413 --> 44:08.478
I hate to admit it, but
Dad's right this time.

44:08.547 --> 44:10.282
<i> I think it was</i>
<i>my fault, and I--</i>

44:10.350 --> 44:11.954
<i> No, it's not</i>
<i>your fault.</i>

44:12.023 --> 44:14.920
<i>Shut the fuck up.</i>
<i>This is life, man.</i>

44:14.989 --> 44:16.993
Life moves on.
You know,

44:17.061 --> 44:18.926
things end, and
fucking women are impossible.

44:18.995 --> 44:20.558
-You know that?
-<i> Yeah?</i>

44:20.627 --> 44:22.262
<i>I don't want to hear all</i>
<i>about all that right now.</i>

44:22.330 --> 44:23.833
<i> It's time</i>
<i>that you go to work.</i>

44:23.902 --> 44:25.397
All right?
It's time that you provide.

44:25.466 --> 44:27.267
If she can't understand
that, then fuck her, dude.

44:27.336 --> 44:29.470
<i> I don't need</i>
<i>a lecture, please. Please.</i>

44:29.539 --> 44:32.910
<i> You need a woman in</i>
<i>your life who raises you up.</i>

44:32.979 --> 44:35.172
<i>Who wants you to be the</i>
<i>man that you want to be.</i>

44:35.241 --> 44:39.445
<i> Yeah, but dude, dude,</i>
<i>this is not the time for a</i>
<i>lecture, man.</i>

44:39.514 --> 44:42.251
<i>We fucking... I don't know.</i>
<i>We had something.</i>

44:42.320 --> 44:46.852
<i>I don't know what it was,</i>
<i>but something great, man.</i>

44:46.921 --> 44:50.894
<i>Like, I can't put</i>
<i>my finger on it.</i>
<i>It's fucking gone now, dude.</i>

44:50.962 --> 44:52.424
<i>I don't know how to</i>
<i>get it back.</i>

44:52.493 --> 44:54.526
<i>You have something</i>
<i>to help me with that,</i>

44:54.595 --> 44:56.634
<i>or are you going to</i>
<i>fucking lecture me all day?</i>

44:56.703 --> 44:58.062
You need to listen
to me, please.

44:58.131 --> 45:00.199
There has been a dramatic shift.

45:00.268 --> 45:02.272
A dramatic shift in
the last century.

45:02.340 --> 45:05.740
I mean, men, they're being told
that they're not good enough,

45:05.809 --> 45:06.839
<i>that women have the power.</i>

45:06.908 --> 45:08.274
<i>That's not fucking true.</i>

45:08.343 --> 45:10.313
<i> Ah, you sound</i>
<i>like dad, dude.</i>

45:10.382 --> 45:12.313
<i> Yeah, let me finish</i>
<i>my point and I'll tell you.</i>

45:12.382 --> 45:15.181
<i>We as man have been told</i>
<i>that we should apologize.</i>

45:15.250 --> 45:18.152
Ah, man, are you
fucking kidding me?

45:18.221 --> 45:20.018
Hey, don't hang up.
Did you just hang up?

45:20.087 --> 45:22.354
Motherfucker, he hung up on me.

46:10.170 --> 46:12.610
<i>♪ Don't call my name ♪</i>

46:12.678 --> 46:15.343
<i>♪ Don't wait for me ♪</i>

<i>Worry 'bout that ♪</i>

48:33.716 --> 48:34.986
Domi...

48:36.615 --> 48:38.017
Oh, my God,
it's good to see you.

48:39.721 --> 48:41.956
-It's so good to see you.

48:42.025 --> 48:43.594
I caught these for you, baby.

48:45.663 --> 48:47.064
Lobsters, huh?

48:49.028 --> 48:51.195
What are you doing here?
I don't wanna be with you.

48:51.263 --> 48:52.937
I miss you. This is nuts.

48:53.006 --> 48:54.702
-Come on, baby.
-I'm fine by myself.

48:54.771 --> 48:56.002
You need me.

48:58.511 --> 48:59.543
For you.

48:59.612 --> 49:00.670
I don't want that.

49:00.739 --> 49:02.143
Why do you
treat me like this?

49:02.212 --> 49:05.015
'Cause I don't
wanna be with you.

49:05.084 --> 49:08.386
Domi, come on.
What can I say?

49:08.455 --> 49:09.750
Go to your boat.

49:09.819 --> 49:10.751
I miss you.

49:10.820 --> 49:12.122
I don't care.

49:14.659 --> 49:15.860
Take the fish.

49:15.929 --> 49:16.923
-No, no, no.
-Let me have dinner.

49:16.992 --> 49:18.057
No, no, no, no, no.

49:24.303 --> 49:27.033
-You don't need
me for anything?
-No.

49:38.281 --> 49:40.282
-You want me to go?
-Yes.

52:11.463 --> 52:13.504
-<i> Honestly, bro.</i>
-<i> Don't hang up this</i>
<i>time.</i>

52:13.573 --> 52:15.306
<i>Don't hang up this time.</i>
<i>Please, just hear me out.</i>

52:15.374 --> 52:17.241
<i> If you even</i>
<i>start with that shit,</i>

52:17.310 --> 52:18.771
<i>I'm fucking hanging</i>
<i>up the phone.</i>

52:18.840 --> 52:20.876
<i>I'm in no mood to hear it.</i>
<i>I don't want--</i>

52:20.945 --> 52:23.744
Look, I haven't been completely
honest with you, okay?
I might have...

52:23.812 --> 52:27.044
I might have taken some
chances with your finances.

52:27.112 --> 52:30.487
<i> You took some</i>
<i>chances with my finances?</i>

52:30.555 --> 52:32.356
<i> Yeah. That rhymes.</i>
<i>Isn't that weird?</i>

52:32.425 --> 52:34.589
<i>Listen, I know what</i>
<i>the plan was, okay?</i>

52:34.657 --> 52:39.257
<i>But I gambled a</i>
<i>little bit and I won.</i>

52:39.325 --> 52:40.526
<i>We won. You won.</i>

52:40.594 --> 52:42.630
<i> I won.</i>
<i>I won what?</i>

52:42.699 --> 52:45.696
<i> You got enough here to</i>
<i>be set up for a while.</i>

52:45.764 --> 52:47.437
You got something here.
Okay?

52:47.506 --> 52:51.271
And if you play this
right, if you listen to me,

52:51.340 --> 52:53.838
there's an outside chance...

52:53.906 --> 52:55.913
There's an outside chance
you can get her back.

52:55.982 --> 52:57.579
You got a plan to get her back.

52:57.648 --> 52:58.741
<i> Dad asks you</i>
<i>anything about this,</i>

52:58.810 --> 53:00.650
<i>I had nothing to do with this.</i>

53:00.719 --> 53:02.253
<i>And I mean that, 'cause</i>
<i>you're gonna fuck this up</i>

53:02.321 --> 53:03.650
<i>and I'm not going down</i>
<i>with you.</i>

54:53.399 --> 54:56.895
I need to get out of
this fucking boat!

55:05.006 --> 55:07.671
Welcome to the real world, pal.
You get an unhappy wife.

55:07.740 --> 55:09.105
You're tired of fucking her.

55:09.174 --> 55:11.844
And she's on your ass
all the time, right?

55:19.987 --> 55:24.021
Look around, all this
could have been yours.

55:25.723 --> 55:27.930
You're breaking my heart.

55:36.604 --> 55:38.640
You really don't get it, do you?

55:42.043 --> 55:45.108
<i>I'm trying to help you out</i>
<i>here, trying to save your life.</i>

55:46.780 --> 55:48.318
Did you even talk
to your brother?

55:48.387 --> 55:51.851
Yeah, he thinks
I'm fucking crazy.

55:51.920 --> 55:54.289
<i> At least I got one</i>
<i>kid who makes sense.</i>

55:54.358 --> 55:57.256
Jesus, you're a fucking idiot.

55:57.325 --> 55:58.825
You know that?

56:00.460 --> 56:02.833
Yeah. I know it.

56:36.465 --> 56:38.131
<i> You're not going.</i>

56:38.200 --> 56:40.067
<i> What do you mean, I'm not</i>
<i>going? It's done, Dad.</i>

56:40.136 --> 56:42.270
<i>-It's done?</i>
<i>"It's done," he says.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

56:42.339 --> 56:44.540
What makes you think
you're gonna have a job
when you get back here?

56:44.609 --> 56:46.143
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

56:46.212 --> 56:47.544
I gotta do what I gotta do?

56:47.612 --> 56:49.480
I'm gonna have us on
a beach that's warm,

56:49.549 --> 56:52.448
where I can surf, where
you can scuba dive

56:52.517 --> 56:54.812
and we can have a great time.
No.

56:54.880 --> 56:56.714
<i>No, I don't wanna hear you.</i>

56:56.783 --> 56:58.788
<i>Just shut up for a second.</i>

56:58.857 --> 57:01.118
Whatever magic you think you're
gonna get back from this cunt--

57:01.186 --> 57:02.824
Hey, don't talk about
my wife that way.

57:02.892 --> 57:05.395
I'll talk about her any
goddamn way I want to.

57:05.463 --> 57:07.127
God! Blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

57:07.196 --> 57:09.294
Fuck her.

57:09.363 --> 57:10.901
Fuck you.

1:05:16.984 --> 1:05:18.648
It's so beautiful.

1:05:21.824 --> 1:05:24.694
I miss you so much.

1:07:30.515 --> 1:07:33.317
And when are you moving in?

1:07:33.386 --> 1:07:36.618
-You want me to move in?
-Yeah.

1:07:36.687 --> 1:07:38.222
But I have such
a nice place now.

1:07:38.291 --> 1:07:40.827
No, I'll go over there.

1:07:40.896 --> 1:07:41.929
No, no, no.

1:07:41.997 --> 1:07:43.760
You've done a better job.

1:07:45.230 --> 1:07:46.700
Soon.
Tomorrow.

1:07:46.769 --> 1:07:48.171
Okay.

1:08:29.313 --> 1:08:30.840
Well, what do you
say if we stay here

1:08:30.909 --> 1:08:34.677
one or two more weeks,
and then we finally go

1:08:34.746 --> 1:08:36.616
and search for
those warm waters?

1:08:36.684 --> 1:08:39.088
I'm really cold here in
this island at night.

1:08:39.156 --> 1:08:41.724
No, let's make it
work here, baby.

1:08:41.793 --> 1:08:43.156
Forget warm waters.

1:08:43.225 --> 1:08:44.893
This island has it all for us.

1:08:44.962 --> 1:08:46.690
I don't wanna go anywhere.

1:08:46.759 --> 1:08:48.759
Yeah, but I'm running
out of supplies.

1:08:48.828 --> 1:08:52.931
I need to go get some
things from the boat.

1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:56.268
Baby, let's just
make it work here.
Forget the boat.

1:08:56.337 --> 1:08:59.141
Let's go today, grab some stuff.

1:08:59.210 --> 1:09:00.909
I really need to
go get some stuff.

1:09:00.977 --> 1:09:02.306
I don't have anything.

1:09:02.375 --> 1:09:04.247
I'm lacking everything.

1:09:05.442 --> 1:09:06.843
Let's go now.

1:10:50.885 --> 1:10:55.655
Baby, I let the Coycoy go.
I sent it out to sea.

1:10:55.724 --> 1:10:58.357
What do you mean, you
sent the boat to sea?

1:10:58.426 --> 1:10:59.963
What are you talking about?

1:11:00.032 --> 1:11:01.330
I... I don't understand, TJ.

1:11:01.399 --> 1:11:03.659
The boat, I sent it to sea.
It's gone.

1:11:03.728 --> 1:11:05.368
I thought that's what we wanted.

1:11:05.436 --> 1:11:07.564
I let it go.
I sent it out to the water.

1:11:07.633 --> 1:11:09.431
Let it go where?
To sea.

1:11:09.500 --> 1:11:10.698
Where to sea?

1:11:10.767 --> 1:11:12.371
Like, what are you saying?

1:11:12.440 --> 1:11:15.004
Relax, baby.
I'm just kidding.

1:11:15.073 --> 1:11:18.740
Kidding?
You can't joke.
My stomach is all tight.

1:11:18.809 --> 1:11:21.181
I would go to the boat now.

1:11:21.249 --> 1:11:23.017
Can you take me today?

1:11:23.085 --> 1:11:24.613
Ah, yeah, baby.

1:11:24.682 --> 1:11:25.881
Wait, where are you going?

1:11:25.950 --> 1:11:27.650
To the boat.
Take me to the boat.

1:11:27.719 --> 1:11:30.122
I want to go grab some things...

1:12:19.111 --> 1:12:20.441
We can't stay here forever.

1:12:20.509 --> 1:12:21.572
I mean, let's go
to the boat and--

1:12:21.641 --> 1:12:23.039
Yeah, we can. It's great.

1:12:23.108 --> 1:12:24.476
This has been the best
part of my whole life.

1:12:24.545 --> 1:12:25.843
Everything's coming together.

1:12:25.912 --> 1:12:27.743
I mean, we were
miserable on the boat.

1:12:27.812 --> 1:12:29.150
We were miserable in the city.

1:12:29.218 --> 1:12:31.847
This is the place for us.

1:12:31.916 --> 1:12:33.353
Yeah, but my...
My...

1:12:33.422 --> 1:12:34.719
I need to go grab some stuff.

1:12:34.788 --> 1:12:36.787
Like, we can't just
stay here forever.

1:12:36.856 --> 1:12:38.693
Like, what are
you talking about?

1:12:38.761 --> 1:12:40.930
Where's the boat?
Where did you park the boat?

1:12:40.999 --> 1:12:43.263
Like, where is it?

1:12:43.331 --> 1:12:45.802
Are you talking for real?

1:12:45.871 --> 1:12:46.968
Is it real?

1:12:47.037 --> 1:12:48.497
Is it a joke?

1:12:48.566 --> 1:12:49.833
I let it go.

1:12:49.902 --> 1:12:52.137
-Let it go where?
-It's gone.

1:12:52.206 --> 1:12:54.807
Where?
What do you mean, you let it go?
Let it go where?

1:12:54.875 --> 1:12:56.745
I...
I thought... I sent it to sea.

1:12:56.813 --> 1:12:59.881
Like I said, I thought
that's what we were gonna do.

1:12:59.950 --> 1:13:03.552
But send it to
sea, what does that mean,
send it to sea?

1:13:03.620 --> 1:13:07.584
Gone. Autopilot,
out to the ocean.

1:13:07.653 --> 1:13:09.921
It's just us here forever.

1:13:11.060 --> 1:13:12.225
It's good.

1:13:12.293 --> 1:13:13.324
-No?
-No!

1:13:13.393 --> 1:13:14.627
Where's the boat?

1:13:14.695 --> 1:13:16.927
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay.

1:13:16.996 --> 1:13:19.396
What do you
mean, we're here forever?
