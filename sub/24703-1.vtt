you have to wear it</i>

01:54.630 --> 01:55.828
<i>or no one at the Con

01:55.830 --> 01:57.463

<i>Oh, Rob and Sean want us to do their

02:26.162 --> 02:28.831
<i>I know that gives you a boner.
Hit me up, buddy boy.</i>

02:29.497 --> 02:31.066
Oh, God.

02:35.704 --> 02:37.470
I think
you've lost weight.

02:37.472 --> 02:39.304
Last time I saw you, I don't
know if you were this size,

02:39.306 --> 02:40.975
which is not to say that you
didn't look good back then.

02:40.977 --> 02:42.608
You look good now.
You look good all the time.

02:42.610 --> 02:43.944
You need anything at all,

02:43.946 --> 02:46.179
you just find
one of us red shirts.

02:46.181 --> 02:48.380
Take care now.
Don't hurt nobody.

02:48.382 --> 02:49.951
Okay, all right, bye.

02:53.788 --> 02:55.588
Sir, this is
only for VIP guests.

02:55.590 --> 02:57.256
I am a VIP guest.

02:57.258 --> 03:00.460
Tex Johnson, US marshal.

03:00.462 --> 03:04.765
Can you be a doll, Tammy, and
help out Mr. Larry Long-face?

03:04.767 --> 03:08.235
OMG. You're Matt Wheeler.

03:08.237 --> 03:09.739
You can call me Wheels.

03:10.573 --> 03:12.773
Oh, my roommate's
gonna freak out.

03:12.775 --> 03:14.374
- Let her freak.
- Mmm!

03:14.376 --> 03:17.643
I love Hiccup and Stringy.
It's my total fave.

03:17.645 --> 03:21.116
I'll do it for you, but only
if you do the Stringy voice.

03:22.585 --> 03:24.684
Hey, gorgeous!

03:24.686 --> 03:26.352
Are you a parking ticket?

03:26.354 --> 03:29.255
'Cause you got "fine"
written all over you.

03:29.257 --> 03:30.589
Oh, Stringy!

03:33.662 --> 03:35.394
Deal's a deal.

03:35.396 --> 03:37.897
- Now, what's your name?
- Steven Spielberg.

03:37.899 --> 03:39.898
Maybe I should try looking
under "Douchebag."

03:39.900 --> 03:42.368
I think Gil would probably
want you to move Keith

03:42.370 --> 03:44.304
next to my table right here.

03:44.306 --> 03:46.039
Can we do a little something
about that?

03:46.041 --> 03:47.172
Yeah.

03:47.174 --> 03:49.442
Great.

03:49.444 --> 03:51.344
What the fuck was that?

03:51.346 --> 03:54.013
That's the sound
a little dick makes.

03:54.015 --> 03:56.882
I have a little dick,
and it doesn't make any noise.

03:56.884 --> 03:59.452
I have a big dick,
and it makes lots of noise.

03:59.454 --> 04:01.755
Mm-hmm!

04:01.757 --> 04:05.093
Did you hear that?
You heard that.

04:33.455 --> 04:36.392
Hey, I recognize you,
handsome devil, huh?

04:37.826 --> 04:39.759
Ah, get your pictures now.
There ya go.

04:41.462 --> 04:44.364
Sure, sure, just a couple
of free ones here.

04:44.366 --> 04:45.766
75 bucks at my table.

04:45.768 --> 04:47.701
Ah, this pen doesn't work.
Sorry.

04:47.703 --> 04:50.636
Hey, come on.
Easy, no touching.

04:50.638 --> 04:52.506
- Hide me, hide me.
- What?

04:52.508 --> 04:54.273
Fucking cocksucker's here.

04:54.275 --> 04:55.876
You are the fucking
smallest guy here,

04:55.878 --> 04:57.509
and I have to use you
to cover me.

04:57.511 --> 05:00.013
Is that Keith Mahar?

05:00.015 --> 05:01.780
- Right there.
- Hey.

05:01.782 --> 05:03.316
Hey, everybody, look.

05:03.318 --> 05:05.552
It's Hadji,
my costar from <i>Tex Johnson.</i>

05:05.554 --> 05:08.088
Keith. My name is Keith.

05:08.090 --> 05:10.290
Sure it is.
Just busting balls.

05:10.292 --> 05:13.360
Hey, speaking of balls,
how they hanging?

05:14.628 --> 05:17.165
Fucking prick.

05:19.835 --> 05:22.001
Can I get a photo
with you guys?

05:22.003 --> 05:24.203
Sure, sure, anything
for the fans, right, Keith?

05:24.205 --> 05:25.705
- Yeah.
- Sure, sure, come on.

05:25.707 --> 05:27.408
Oh, okay, okay.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.376
Here, get my good side.

05:29.378 --> 05:31.414
Go, good.

05:33.515 --> 05:34.581
All right, smile.

05:34.583 --> 05:36.615
And...

05:36.617 --> 05:39.085
Fucking dick pic.

05:39.087 --> 05:40.920
Ah, that's not bad.
You missed your calling.

05:40.922 --> 05:42.388
You should've been
a photographer, Hadji.

05:42.390 --> 05:44.490
- Hey, well, you know.
- All right.

05:44.492 --> 05:47.160
- Catch ya later, Hadj.
- Yeah, great.

05:47.162 --> 05:49.295
Hope you catch something
later, you fuck.

05:49.297 --> 05:50.963
- Move, move, move, move.
- I bet you him and her

05:50.965 --> 05:52.532
stand beside each other
at the urinal.

05:52.534 --> 05:54.734
Where the fucking hat
I bought you? Where's the hat?

05:54.736 --> 05:57.670
Nobody knows who the fuck you are
without the hat on your head.

05:57.672 --> 05:59.638
I believe the appropriate
term is "turban."

05:59.640 --> 06:01.607
Okay, turban, the jihabi,

06:01.609 --> 06:04.110
the Pamper you was wearing
on your fucking head.

06:04.112 --> 06:07.713
A jibjab rag, a diaper,
where's the fucking hat?

06:07.715 --> 06:09.518
- Um...
- You know this guy?

06:09.951 --> 06:12.585
Harold? Kumar?

06:12.587 --> 06:15.088
I'm not fucking either
of those people.

06:15.090 --> 06:17.624
Callahan. This is
my head of security,

06:17.626 --> 06:19.292
and this is my brother-in-law,

06:19.294 --> 06:21.627
and I'm gonna let him
loose on your ass

06:21.629 --> 06:23.763
if you rearrange
my seating again.

06:23.765 --> 06:25.198
I don't play that shit.

06:25.200 --> 06:28.437
Get Jay on the phone.
Motherfucker!

06:36.210 --> 06:39.112
Can't even move fast enough
to fucking scare me.

06:39.114 --> 06:41.581
Osama bin fucking eating.

06:41.583 --> 06:43.350
- Seriously?
- Yeah, dude.

06:43.352 --> 06:45.518
She left me for her fucking
personal trainer.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.186
I should've known
something was up.

06:47.188 --> 06:48.554
She would go to the gym
in high heels.

06:48.556 --> 06:50.023
Who works out in high heels?

06:50.025 --> 06:51.657
Staying fat wasn't a clue?

06:51.659 --> 06:53.227
She filed for divorce,
emptied the bank account,

06:53.229 --> 06:55.028
kicked me out
of the apartment.

06:55.030 --> 06:57.463
Can't you get spousal support
or something?

06:57.465 --> 06:59.299
Yeah, I would need
a lawyer for that,

06:59.301 --> 07:00.934
and I'm already paying for
the fucking lawyer she hired

07:00.936 --> 07:02.268
to divorce me.

07:02.270 --> 07:05.405
She's what they call
"a cunt burger."

07:05.407 --> 07:07.910
Ooh, I've had
one of those before.

07:10.145 --> 07:12.444
Yep, I told you
that wench was bad news.

07:12.446 --> 07:15.881
You're an asshole. You fucking
introduced me to her.

07:15.883 --> 07:17.384
In Vegas, baby.

07:17.386 --> 07:20.020
- Didn't you shit your pants?
- It was a shart.

07:20.022 --> 07:21.557
Motherf...

07:27.696 --> 07:29.095
<i>Good.</i>

07:29.097 --> 07:31.066
- Controller's busted.
- <i>Round two.</i>

07:32.066 --> 07:34.033
Go home, old man, you suck!

07:38.340 --> 07:39.508
Really?

07:40.708 --> 07:42.074
I've seen a naked woman.

07:44.847 --> 07:46.612
In real life.

07:47.982 --> 07:50.984
Oh, mike drop.

07:50.986 --> 07:52.985
I didn't tell you
the worst part.

07:52.987 --> 07:54.054
What's that?

07:54.056 --> 07:55.524
She took Bob.

07:56.558 --> 07:58.124
She fucking took Bob?

07:58.126 --> 07:59.494
She stole my dog.

08:00.527 --> 08:02.961
What kind of a person
steals a man's dog?

08:02.963 --> 08:04.530
An animal.

08:04.532 --> 08:07.199
Yeah. She didn't even
like the fucking dog.

08:07.201 --> 08:09.201
And she ties him up
in the apartment all day.

08:09.203 --> 08:11.840
Now I'm in a custody battle over
some shit I can't even afford.

08:12.674 --> 08:14.441
And what was your name again?

08:14.443 --> 08:16.275
You know, I can't believe
your Con agent let you go out

08:16.277 --> 08:19.048
looking like a special-needs
M. Night Shyamalan.

08:19.715 --> 08:21.250
Look at this.

08:23.349 --> 08:24.519
Yo, check it out.
Ms. Lily's here.

08:25.386 --> 08:26.920
Mmm.

08:26.922 --> 08:29.355
You know sometimes when
I'm drunk, I do two things...

08:29.357 --> 08:31.857
Watch <i>Ms. Lily's Classroom,</i>

08:31.859 --> 08:35.760
and then I jerk off while
watching <i>Ms. Lily's Classroom.</i>

08:35.763 --> 08:37.929
Not to the classroom part.
Just Ms. Lily.

08:37.932 --> 08:41.168
I'm not a fucking creep. Kinda
wanna jerk off right now.

08:41.169 --> 08:43.303
Why don't you take
that glorious headshot over?

08:43.304 --> 08:45.505
Oh, yeah,
this is what she wants.

08:45.507 --> 08:48.074
An unemployed
former child actor

08:48.076 --> 08:51.545
whose life resembles
a pile of dog shit.

08:51.547 --> 08:54.012
Hey, Wheeler, where's Hiccup
this weekend, man?

08:54.014 --> 08:55.280
Rehab.

08:55.282 --> 08:58.017
- Hey, who are you?
- Keith Mahar.

08:58.019 --> 08:59.184
I was on <i>Tex Johnson.</i>

08:59.186 --> 09:00.721
Was that Keith Mahar?

09:00.723 --> 09:02.655
Testicular cancer ring a bell?

09:02.657 --> 09:04.457
- Oh, my God.
- You're the ball cancer kid!

09:04.459 --> 09:08.294
Hey, everybody,
it's the ball cancer kid! Hey!

09:08.296 --> 09:11.131
Mommy, I got ball cancer!

09:11.133 --> 09:12.365
Oh, geez.

09:12.367 --> 09:14.067
Fuck me.
I thought you were dead.

09:14.069 --> 09:17.904
Nope, didn't actually
have testicular cancer,

09:17.906 --> 09:19.441
therefore didn't die.

09:20.008 --> 09:21.407
Just your career.

09:22.811 --> 09:24.109
Fuckwad.

09:24.111 --> 09:26.447
Hey, Bobble D.

09:28.249 --> 09:31.117
A lemmy for me
and an Irish Car Bomb

09:31.119 --> 09:32.584
for my terrorist friend here.

09:32.586 --> 09:34.688
I'm Indian,
you fucking dummy.

09:34.690 --> 09:37.622
I didn't know
this was a gay bar.

09:37.624 --> 09:39.159
Hello, lesbo face.

09:39.161 --> 09:41.261
We were just about
to start scissoring.

09:41.263 --> 09:43.228
McNealy,
that filthy mouth of yours

09:43.230 --> 09:45.698
is not gonna get me
back to your room tonight.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.534
Chardonnay for me, thanks.

09:47.536 --> 09:50.203
- Can I get that In a to-go cup?
- Jack and Coke, please.

09:50.205 --> 09:51.637
And can he get a thong
and a scrunchie

09:51.639 --> 09:53.640
and maybe a Tampax
with that too?

09:53.642 --> 09:56.108
This is Rocky.
We went to Michigan together.

09:56.110 --> 09:57.577
Now we're just fucking.

09:57.579 --> 09:59.445
You're not a personal trainer,
are you?

09:59.447 --> 10:01.915
He's a DJ. He's spinning
the rave tonight.

10:01.917 --> 10:03.782
When he comes,
does soy sauce come out?

10:03.784 --> 10:06.486
Green or red? The low sodium
or the regular sodium?

10:06.488 --> 10:07.420
Keith.

10:07.422 --> 10:09.188
They call me Pharaoh.

10:09.190 --> 10:10.589
What do they call you?

10:10.591 --> 10:11.857
- Pharaoh.
- Oh.

10:11.859 --> 10:13.425
I thought you were
saying, "Herro."

10:13.427 --> 10:16.262
I should take off, Al,
get my shit together.

10:16.264 --> 10:18.667
Yeah, they're animals.

10:20.167 --> 10:21.801
I'm a DJ too.

10:21.803 --> 10:24.603
- He works out.
- I work out.

10:24.605 --> 10:26.905
Yeah, but he's supposed
to be working out math.

10:26.907 --> 10:29.642
He's dehydrated.
He's lost a lot of fluids.

10:29.644 --> 10:30.776
He is pretty big though.

10:30.778 --> 10:32.144
Yeah. He's huge in Japan.

10:32.146 --> 10:34.413
Hey, three inches is big
in Japan.

10:34.415 --> 10:36.248
Yeah, so you're like
average there.

10:36.250 --> 10:38.785
Does he go down on you
with chopsticks?

10:38.787 --> 10:42.023
You ever go down on him and
you're hungry half an hour later?

10:43.891 --> 10:45.056
He was big though.

10:45.058 --> 10:46.559
- Wait a minute.
- What?

10:46.561 --> 10:49.131
What time is
your Classic TV panel?

10:49.830 --> 10:51.798
Um, at...

10:51.800 --> 10:53.669
Oh, fuck-me-o'clock.

10:54.168 --> 10:55.603
I'll drink it.

11:01.009 --> 11:02.507
- You got this.
- Now you're ready.

11:02.509 --> 11:03.843
Bye.

11:03.845 --> 11:05.411
Tell King he sucks.

11:33.841 --> 11:36.443
Downtown Crime.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.978
<i>Starring Brock Hutchinson</i>

11:38.980 --> 11:41.613
<i>as Detective Mitch Sipes.</i>

11:42.884 --> 11:45.550
I look like
one of the Village People.

11:45.552 --> 11:47.687
I'm gonna tell you
the true story here right now.

11:47.689 --> 11:49.622
Brock, being the guy
that he is,

11:49.624 --> 11:52.391
he gave a bit of encouragement
to a young Tom Selleck.

11:52.393 --> 11:53.825
He said, "Now this is
between you and me."

11:53.827 --> 11:55.093
You're out of breath?

11:55.095 --> 11:56.963
The bar is next door.

11:56.965 --> 11:58.231
- Don't judge me.
- Mm-hmm.

11:58.233 --> 11:59.564
What did I miss?

11:59.566 --> 12:01.700
Just your dignity,
sweetheart.

12:01.702 --> 12:04.069
"Tom, why don't you go on home,
grow yourself a mustache,

12:04.071 --> 12:05.671
and then try it again."

12:05.673 --> 12:09.842
Let's bring out the star
of <i>Downtown Crime,</i>

12:09.844 --> 12:14.180
ladies and gentlemen,
Brock Hutchinson!

12:14.182 --> 12:16.248
Come on out, Brock.
Come on out!

12:16.250 --> 12:18.818
I came out years ago!

12:21.955 --> 12:24.756
Hello, Westwego.

12:26.061 --> 12:27.894
When you get the clap
from you guys,

12:27.896 --> 12:30.228
I think you really mean it.

12:30.230 --> 12:33.333
I don't wanna leave you out here
all by yourself there, Brock.

12:33.335 --> 12:37.636
Our next guest, everyone's
favorite ball cancer kid.

12:40.142 --> 12:41.343
Fuck me.

12:43.110 --> 12:44.376
<i>Ooh!</i>

12:44.378 --> 12:48.014
<i>You've been a bad Hadji.</i>

12:48.016 --> 12:49.848
<i>That's gonna leave a mark.</i>

12:51.351 --> 12:53.051
<i>You see here, little fella,</i>

12:53.053 --> 12:55.021
<i>down here in Texas,
we take care of our own.</i>

12:55.023 --> 12:59.593
<i>Speaking of which,
you feeling okay?</i>

12:59.595 --> 13:03.029
<i>Go ahead, Hadji.
We're all friends here.</i>

13:03.031 --> 13:05.464
<i>It's okay to talk about,
Judge Glover.</i>

13:05.466 --> 13:08.067
<i>Tex told me I have
testicular cancer.</i>

13:08.069 --> 13:10.069
Oh, Hadji!

13:12.072 --> 13:16.775
All right,
from <i>Tex Johnson, US Marshal,</i>

13:16.777 --> 13:20.246
it's that crazy
go-kart-driving Hadji,

13:20.248 --> 13:22.048
Keith Mahar!

13:31.058 --> 13:33.728
Get the fuck outta here.
Prick.

13:37.231 --> 13:39.232
<i>Attention, Supercon.</i>

13:39.234 --> 13:40.967
<i>Remember, personal hygiene
affects everyone.</i>

13:40.969 --> 13:42.535
Hey.

13:42.537 --> 13:44.102
<i>If you smell someone,
tell someone.</i>

13:44.104 --> 13:45.673
Keep it in the pants, man.

13:45.974 --> 13:47.506
Skip.

13:47.508 --> 13:49.708
Hey, you see that guy?
Is he your type?

13:49.710 --> 13:52.245
Over you?
A thousand times, yes.

13:52.247 --> 13:54.816
How about Adam King of
the Cocks over there?

13:55.450 --> 13:56.982
He's a prick.

13:56.984 --> 13:59.419
Hides it well
from the fans though.

13:59.421 --> 14:01.387
Well, you and Mr. Sulu,
that really happening?

14:01.389 --> 14:03.889
Listen, you need
to let this go.

14:03.891 --> 14:05.824
You're too pretty
to give good head.

14:05.826 --> 14:09.197
Never had to work for it.
I'm just not that into you.

14:10.465 --> 14:11.931
When you're banging
Chairman Mao,

14:11.933 --> 14:13.632
do you think of me
the whole time

14:13.634 --> 14:15.168
or just during climax?

14:15.170 --> 14:16.868
Which I can only
assume happens

14:16.870 --> 14:18.570
while he's neatly folding
clothes in the other room.

14:18.572 --> 14:21.974
Is neatness even
a racial stereotype?

14:21.976 --> 14:23.809
If it's not,
it should be, right?

14:23.811 --> 14:26.779
I don't fuck racists.
Bye, Felicia.

14:26.781 --> 14:28.280
Cold, cold.

14:28.282 --> 14:30.315
<i>Football is in
my possession, RTV, over.</i>

14:30.317 --> 14:33.118
Copy that. Callahan's on his
way to your office, sir.

14:33.120 --> 14:36.257
He's got money from
the first round of photo ops.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.394
Is it true he's a Navy Seal?

14:41.396 --> 14:43.663
What?
I'm surrounded by idiots.

14:43.665 --> 14:45.197
<i>We're still having
that little issue.</i>

14:45.199 --> 14:46.766
- Copy that.
- Back over there.

14:46.768 --> 14:49.468
Okay. Seth Green, sir,
he needs a new chair.

14:49.470 --> 14:51.840
He's too short, evidently.

14:52.941 --> 14:55.341
Saw the legs off the table.
Shit.

14:55.343 --> 14:58.044
That's a good idea, sir.
Um, one more thing.

14:58.046 --> 15:00.146
Adam King is flirting
with our interns,

15:00.148 --> 15:02.883
and she's only 15, Gil.

15:04.652 --> 15:07.420
First off,
my name is Mr. Bartell.

15:07.422 --> 15:09.054
Oh.

15:09.056 --> 15:11.089
Yeah. Second of all,

15:11.091 --> 15:14.828
<i>my man Adam King is signing
for four hours each day.</i>

15:14.830 --> 15:19.033
<i>We move 10 mouth-breathers
through the line a minute.</i>

15:20.268 --> 15:24.371
<i>He gets $75
per signature or a photo.</i>

15:24.373 --> 15:27.372
<i>That's roughly about
$180,000 per day.</i>

15:27.374 --> 15:29.574
<i>120 grand to me.</i>

15:29.576 --> 15:32.846
<i>And 420 grand to him.</i>

15:32.848 --> 15:35.580
<i>Green is for the money
and what?</i>

15:35.582 --> 15:37.282
<i>Gold is for the honey.</i>

15:43.423 --> 15:47.059
Every time he's not signing
autographs and taking photos,

15:47.061 --> 15:49.527
you're literally taking
money out of my pocket.

15:49.529 --> 15:51.030
No, sir, I wouldn't...

15:51.032 --> 15:53.535
Wait. How much does
Adam King charge?

15:56.003 --> 15:57.306
Go pick it up.

15:58.239 --> 16:00.272
- Now?
- Let's go, let's go!

16:00.274 --> 16:01.542
Yes, sir!

16:11.420 --> 16:13.852
- How'd the panel go?
- Could've gone better.

16:13.854 --> 16:15.755
You know, these fucking things
are making way more money

16:15.757 --> 16:17.189
than we are this weekend.

16:17.191 --> 16:18.690
My show ran for four seasons,

16:18.692 --> 16:21.861
and those four wheels
of shiny wax shit

16:21.863 --> 16:23.729
broke down every episode.

16:23.731 --> 16:25.530
One of 'em blew up once.

16:25.532 --> 16:28.299
For no reason at all.
Just kaboom!

16:28.301 --> 16:29.671
Hey, this is weed.

16:30.537 --> 16:32.039
Are you a cop?

16:34.274 --> 16:35.775
Where the hell is Wheeler?

16:35.777 --> 16:37.713
He forgot something
in his room.

16:38.613 --> 16:39.945
He's taking a shit.

16:39.947 --> 16:43.082
Oh, my God.

16:45.753 --> 16:47.888
I gotta call you back, Dad.

16:57.531 --> 17:00.032
I know.
You're speechless.

17:00.034 --> 17:02.737
Thought we were getting
an Uber.

17:04.104 --> 17:07.039
Everyone, meet
Mr. Sean and Mr. Robert.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.742
- Hey, guys.
- Together, they are NerdGasm.

17:09.743 --> 17:12.042
To call these gentlemen "fans"
would be an insult.

17:12.045 --> 17:15.981
I like to think of them
as men among boys.

17:15.983 --> 17:19.385
Can I ask you guys,
the experts, a Con question?

17:19.387 --> 17:22.119
Adam King, awesome or asshole?

17:22.122 --> 17:23.722
Wait, you mean
Captain James W. Slade?

17:23.723 --> 17:25.457
Right. Asshole, right?

17:25.459 --> 17:27.626
AKA <i>Future
Force's</i> Golden Guardian?

17:27.627 --> 17:29.898
Or Tex Johnson...

17:30.298 --> 17:32.030
US Marshal?

17:32.032 --> 17:34.166
Uh, he's awesome.

17:37.804 --> 17:41.075
Tell me, do you guys
pick up girls in this thing?

17:41.842 --> 17:43.341
It's like Spanish Fly.

17:43.343 --> 17:45.045
It's a panty-dropper.

17:48.182 --> 17:49.549
Dorks.

17:49.551 --> 17:51.649
By the way,
where are we going?

17:51.651 --> 17:53.519
You guys like barbecue,
crawfish?

17:53.521 --> 17:55.620
I like Applebee's.

17:55.622 --> 17:57.755
Yeah, it's just like that.

17:57.757 --> 17:59.724
You gotta
take a left right here.

17:59.726 --> 18:03.162
Since we're all here, you know,
Sean and I, we do a podcast.

18:03.164 --> 18:05.431
It's called NerdGasm,
F-T-Dub.

18:05.433 --> 18:07.566
- Never miss it.
- Yeah?

18:07.568 --> 18:09.068
- Uh-huh.
- I thought of the name.

18:09.070 --> 18:11.303
We wanted all you guys
to be on it.

18:11.305 --> 18:12.704
Love to.

18:12.706 --> 18:13.806
Allison's gonna
need a small mike.

18:13.808 --> 18:15.607
She likes small mikes.

18:15.609 --> 18:17.609
There's a smaller red one,

18:17.611 --> 18:19.078
or we got a big black one
up here.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.512
Kid-size?

18:20.514 --> 18:21.746
- We can see what we got.
- Baby mikes?

18:21.748 --> 18:23.182
Party size.

18:23.184 --> 18:24.482
Party. There you go.

18:24.484 --> 18:25.986
Better for anal.

18:28.789 --> 18:32.759
So is that a yes,
or is that a...

18:32.761 --> 18:34.961
Well, you know
Matt did say we'd do it, so...

18:34.963 --> 18:36.828
Great! Three, two, one.

18:39.399 --> 18:41.366
Oh, check the levels.

18:41.368 --> 18:42.601
Oh, you mean now.

18:42.603 --> 18:44.136
Levels, Sean!

18:44.138 --> 18:48.240
Hi-yo, you
NerdGasmics, nerd-a-maniacs,

18:48.242 --> 18:54.113
- tuning into our podcast...
- For the win!

18:54.115 --> 18:57.482
As always, it's your boy
Hot Rob and the Seanster.

18:57.484 --> 18:59.685
- 'Sup.
- Coming to you live

18:59.687 --> 19:02.187
from the cockpit
of the shuttle craft.

19:02.189 --> 19:04.423
- You say cock?
- I didn't say cock.

19:04.425 --> 19:06.759
Cock-a-doodle-do,
we are right here, gentlemen.

19:08.663 --> 19:10.796
What the fuck?

19:10.798 --> 19:13.201
Look at this piece of shit.

19:14.301 --> 19:16.271
This doesn't look
like Applebee's.

19:17.371 --> 19:19.305
Hey, nice ride,
Captain Kirk.

19:19.307 --> 19:21.240
Set your phasers to fag.

19:21.242 --> 19:22.709
Whoo!

19:22.711 --> 19:24.976
Hey, man, sorry!
We gotta go! Bye-bye!

19:24.978 --> 19:26.013
Yeah!

19:30.417 --> 19:32.253
I think you dropped this.

19:38.059 --> 19:39.060
Queers.

19:40.561 --> 19:41.961
Fuck you.

19:41.963 --> 19:43.796
Dude, what the fuck
was that, man?

19:43.798 --> 19:46.165
That guy looked like my dad.
I don't need that shit, man.

19:46.167 --> 19:48.166
- Fuck you, man.
- That was ball cancer kid?

19:48.168 --> 19:49.667
Aw, fuck.

19:49.669 --> 19:51.205
Called respect.

19:52.173 --> 19:53.606
Respect.

19:53.608 --> 19:55.543
Ball cancer got balls.
Respect!

19:57.744 --> 20:00.311
Fuck! That was my last beer.

20:00.313 --> 20:01.880
There's been
a rumor going around

20:01.882 --> 20:04.249
that Dragon-Con
was robbed of 100 grand

20:04.251 --> 20:07.185
by some guys dressed up
like stormtroopers.

20:07.187 --> 20:08.988
<i>New Hope</i>
or <i>Force Awakens?</i>

20:08.990 --> 20:10.589
- Does it matter?
- It matters.

20:10.591 --> 20:12.357
<i>New Hope,</i> okay?
Stay with me.

20:12.359 --> 20:13.992
It's an urban legend.

20:13.994 --> 20:17.363
Bullshit. I heard it
from a very reliable source.

20:17.365 --> 20:18.629
Her pot dealer.

20:18.631 --> 20:20.933
Medical marijuana provider.

20:20.935 --> 20:22.734
What's the story?

20:22.736 --> 20:26.571
Evidently the guy,
or guys, walked in

20:26.573 --> 20:30.809
and held up the con office,
like <i>Pulp Fiction.</i>

20:30.811 --> 20:33.279
They grabbed the cash,

20:33.281 --> 20:36.014
and then they escaped

20:36.016 --> 20:38.483
by slipping into
the big cosplay parade

20:38.485 --> 20:41.854
that takes over
downtown Atlanta every year.

20:41.856 --> 20:44.092
They timed it so perfectly...

20:46.359 --> 20:51.099
They blended in seamlessly
with the 501st Legion.

20:52.367 --> 20:53.598
Clean getaway.

20:58.773 --> 21:00.341
Oh, fuck.

21:01.743 --> 21:04.878
Not this fucking guy.
Here?

21:05.846 --> 21:08.513
I gotta throw a piss.

21:08.515 --> 21:11.015
- Look who that is.
- How do you throw a piss?

21:11.017 --> 21:12.984
- Oh!
- You leave a piss.

21:12.986 --> 21:15.253
- Maybe he doesn't hold it.
- You throw a party.

21:15.255 --> 21:17.723
Oh, my God.
Maybe it's a piss party.

21:17.725 --> 21:20.193
Hadji!

21:20.195 --> 21:22.427
What kinda trouble
you getting into now, son?

21:22.429 --> 21:25.196
Oh, you're not eating pork,
are you, Mahar?

21:25.198 --> 21:26.964
Aren't all the other cabbies
gonna get pissed

21:26.966 --> 21:29.135
that you're chowing down
on the sacred cow?

21:29.137 --> 21:32.137
Cow, pork, same thing, right?
Fucking idiot.

21:32.139 --> 21:34.840
Oh, Allison,
looking stunning as usual.

21:34.842 --> 21:36.675
Brock Hutchinson,
you old queen.

21:36.677 --> 21:39.780
What are you doing hanging out
with the supporting cast, huh?

21:41.782 --> 21:43.449
I haven't seen
an asshole this big

21:43.451 --> 21:45.084
since Andy Dick's
Christmas party.

21:45.086 --> 21:48.119
- Good call.
- Yeah.

21:48.121 --> 21:50.690
Hey, listen, Adam,
we're about to leave.

21:50.692 --> 21:53.091
Excuse me,
are you Adam King?

21:53.093 --> 21:54.859
- Hold on, hold on.
- Adam <i>Future Force</i> King?

21:54.861 --> 21:56.261
Not right now, player.
Not right now.

21:56.263 --> 21:57.495
Good eye, kid.

21:57.497 --> 21:58.830
Can I shake...

21:58.832 --> 21:59.999
- Gil, it's okay.
- I can't...

22:00.001 --> 22:01.700
It's okay, Gil, it's okay.

22:01.702 --> 22:04.336
I just wanna...
Oh, my God.

22:04.338 --> 22:07.071
- Sir, I'm an actor too.
- Where did he come from?

22:07.073 --> 22:09.540
I've learned so much
from watching your shows.

22:09.542 --> 22:11.175
Do you teach an acting class
or something?

22:11.177 --> 22:13.645
- We'd love to take it.
- Fuck me.

22:13.647 --> 22:15.780
I'll give you one
for free.

22:15.782 --> 22:18.686
From one great actor
to another actor,

22:19.753 --> 22:22.053
those that can't, teach.

22:22.055 --> 22:25.723
I learned everything I needed
from the streets, kid.

22:25.725 --> 22:27.092
Is it true that you
turned down

22:27.094 --> 22:29.228
the role of John McClane
in <i>Die Hard?</i>

22:29.230 --> 22:30.963
Let me tell you something.

22:30.965 --> 22:34.165
The King can't be upstaged
by a skyscraper.

22:34.167 --> 22:37.569
Ah! Nakatomi ain't got nothing
on the King.

22:37.571 --> 22:41.208
Well, you just keep doing
that awesome thing you do.

22:42.877 --> 22:45.480
Got no other choice, kid.

22:48.916 --> 22:51.216
Yeah, dude!
Come on, man!

22:51.218 --> 22:54.054
All right, come on. Let's
get something to eat, huh?

22:54.888 --> 22:56.387
You'll never make it, Wheeler.

22:56.389 --> 22:59.558
- Never in life.
- Let's get some chow, huh?

22:59.560 --> 23:01.293
I suggest we get outta here.

23:01.295 --> 23:04.131
- Let's go see DJ Chardonnay.
- Copy that.

23:07.167 --> 23:10.970
What a fucking racist,
homophobic prick.

23:10.972 --> 23:14.475
He used to do the same shit to me
on set when I was 10 years old.

23:16.410 --> 23:17.811
He'll get his.

23:18.846 --> 23:21.182
Might be sooner
rather than later.

23:53.046 --> 23:54.981
<i>And she's
gonna tell us all about</i>

23:54.983 --> 23:57.082
<i>her favorite hat pattern.</i>

23:57.084 --> 24:00.351
- <i>Oh, thank you!</i>
- <i>Good to have you on the show.</i>

24:00.353 --> 24:02.287
<i>It's nice to
meet you, finally.</i>

24:02.289 --> 24:04.088
<i>I've been working on this
for a while.</i>

24:04.090 --> 24:05.691
<i>It's a basket-weave hat,</i>

24:05.693 --> 24:08.659
<i>like you make the basket-weave
for the baby blankets.</i>

24:08.661 --> 24:10.328
<i>Well, I have always
loved that pattern.</i>

24:10.330 --> 24:12.397
All right,
I got something

24:12.399 --> 24:13.965
that's gonna turn
this night around.

24:13.967 --> 24:16.070
All I'm offering

24:16.803 --> 24:18.069
is the truth.

24:18.071 --> 24:19.873
Nothing more.

24:20.808 --> 24:22.273
How can we refuse?

24:22.275 --> 24:23.642
Brock?

24:23.644 --> 24:26.013
Mmm. I'm in.

24:27.415 --> 24:28.482
What are they?

24:28.948 --> 24:30.384
Does it matter?

24:31.985 --> 24:33.851
Swear to God,
if this is Viagra,

24:33.853 --> 24:36.321
we're gonna find out if Brock's
a power bottom or not.

25:45.025 --> 25:47.158
<i>Attention, Supercon,</i>

25:47.160 --> 25:50.228
<i>the Klingon linguistics panel
has been changed to...</i>

25:52.331 --> 25:54.199
You look like hammered shit.

25:54.201 --> 25:56.867
I think I might've fucked
a chicken last night.

25:56.869 --> 25:58.604
Been there.

25:58.606 --> 26:01.906
It's all a blur. The last
thing I remember is...

26:01.908 --> 26:03.642
The Dixie Pig.

26:03.644 --> 26:05.280
From last night.

26:10.952 --> 26:13.154
Motherfucker!

26:23.097 --> 26:24.829
You know, you're a real
fucking asshole.

26:24.831 --> 26:28.867
Guess that barbecue sauce is
going to leave a mark, Hadji.

26:28.869 --> 26:30.338
Don't fuck with the King.

26:31.405 --> 26:32.771
Yeah.

26:32.773 --> 26:37.041
Ball cancer kid.
Ball cancer kid.

26:37.043 --> 26:40.311
Ball cancer kid.
Ball cancer kid.

26:40.313 --> 26:43.415
Ball cancer kid.
Ball cancer kid.

26:43.417 --> 26:46.952
Ball cancer kid.
Ball cancer kid.

26:46.954 --> 26:50.090
Ball cancer kid.
Ball cancer kid.

26:51.725 --> 26:53.826
I'm telling you, man,
he fucked a chicken.

26:53.828 --> 26:55.029
Wasn't pretty.

26:56.163 --> 26:58.430
What you do, I guess.

26:58.432 --> 27:01.200
Mm. Ned Stark, right?

27:01.202 --> 27:02.467
And that 'fro is on fire,
my man.

27:02.469 --> 27:04.204
Keep it hard, Mr. Cronin.

27:04.938 --> 27:06.504
Keep it hard.

27:06.506 --> 27:07.706
How you feeling?

27:07.708 --> 27:09.941
Day two, guys.
How are you doing?

27:09.943 --> 27:12.610
Oh, hey, it's big day.

27:12.612 --> 27:14.646
You know,
lots of people to meet,

27:14.648 --> 27:15.848
lots to get signed.

27:15.850 --> 27:17.217
I missed you guys last night.

27:18.349 --> 27:19.350
- We could've used you.
- Really?

27:19.352 --> 27:21.685
<i>Attention, security,
please report to section three.</i>

27:21.687 --> 27:24.656
Oh, no, whoa.
That's King's section.

27:24.658 --> 27:28.026
How the fuck do you know that?

27:28.028 --> 27:30.328
I mean, come on, if there's
anything I know this weekend,

27:30.330 --> 27:31.963
it's who's at what table.

27:31.965 --> 27:34.499
This guy.

27:34.501 --> 27:36.768
<i>Security,
report to section three.</i>

27:36.770 --> 27:38.002
Oh, shit.

27:38.004 --> 27:41.306
Ball cancer kid!
Ball cancer kid!

27:41.308 --> 27:43.841
Ball cancer kid!
Ball cancer kid!

27:43.843 --> 27:46.780
- Fuck you!
- Hey, what the fuck is wrong...

27:47.580 --> 27:50.650
That's the last time, Hadji.

27:55.921 --> 27:57.990
You piece of shit!

27:57.992 --> 27:59.724
Not the face!
Not the... You...

27:59.726 --> 28:01.326
You fucking...
Stop it, stop it!

28:01.328 --> 28:03.729
Break it up.

28:03.731 --> 28:05.964
Stop it!
Come on, man. Break it up!

28:05.966 --> 28:07.667
Stop! Stop it!

28:08.135 --> 28:09.637
Eww.

28:15.208 --> 28:16.609
Oh, no.

28:17.244 --> 28:19.080
That's barbecue sauce?

28:20.281 --> 28:21.946
Keith and King got in a fight.

28:21.948 --> 28:24.049
More of a mud wrestle.

28:24.051 --> 28:26.318
Gil got involved.
It got ugly.

28:26.320 --> 28:28.086
And he fired the three of us.

28:28.088 --> 28:29.523
All three of you?

28:31.725 --> 28:33.558
Where's Gil?

28:33.560 --> 28:35.860
Is it really that bad?
He's upset with me?

28:35.862 --> 28:37.494
What kinda shit is that?

28:37.496 --> 28:39.330
He's really upset that he...

28:39.332 --> 28:41.067
Do you really wanna
be with him?

28:41.069 --> 28:43.033
I mean, be honest.

28:43.035 --> 28:45.636
You are living proof that
evolution works in reverse.

28:45.638 --> 28:47.705
How you gonna
fix this, Gil, huh?

28:47.707 --> 28:49.540
Come on. Shock me with
an intelligent answer.

28:49.542 --> 28:52.644
- Blow my mind.
- I fired everybody's ass.

28:52.646 --> 28:53.945
Ehh! Wrong.

28:53.947 --> 28:56.181
That is YP, not MP.

28:56.183 --> 28:58.215
- Your problem, not my problem.
- I got it.

28:58.217 --> 29:00.152
See? Even she knows
what I'm talking about.

29:00.154 --> 29:01.685
- Picture this.
- Aw, man!

29:01.687 --> 29:04.589
Hundreds of sweaty,
obese single parents,

29:04.591 --> 29:07.659
the walking fucking dead
with their fat little fingers

29:07.661 --> 29:10.761
holding illiterate
crayon signs saying,

29:10.763 --> 29:13.232
"Supercon sucks."

29:13.234 --> 29:15.867
No! Why? What?

29:15.869 --> 29:17.437
Leave.

29:24.311 --> 29:25.644
Can I have a hug?

29:26.746 --> 29:28.349
I just want a...

29:29.215 --> 29:31.250
You usually hug me.

29:34.353 --> 29:38.022
Oh, what fools
these mortals be...

29:38.024 --> 29:40.125
Or not to be.

29:40.127 --> 29:41.960
That is the question.

29:41.962 --> 29:43.763
Shakespeare, baby.

29:45.666 --> 29:50.303
I might have to ask you
for something very special.

29:51.871 --> 29:53.273
Lucky me.

29:53.773 --> 29:54.908
Yes.

29:56.577 --> 29:59.243
- Uh, Gil.
- What do you want today?

29:59.245 --> 30:01.046
It was all my fault, okay?

30:01.048 --> 30:03.915
Fuck. Listen,
you can't fire my friends.

30:03.917 --> 30:05.517
You gotta un-fire 'em.

30:05.519 --> 30:07.118
I ain't got time
for your shit today, Wheeler.

30:07.120 --> 30:09.288
Well, I'm telling you, man,
this shit's gonna come out

30:09.290 --> 30:11.356
no matter
how you wanna play it.

30:11.358 --> 30:16.060
Gil, listen, man, you can't
fire Allison, Brock, and Keith

30:16.062 --> 30:17.695
for something I fucking did.

30:17.697 --> 30:19.263
Watch your tone.
It's my convention.

30:19.265 --> 30:20.732
I'll do what the fuck
I want with it.

30:20.734 --> 30:22.401
But you got it all wrong, man.

30:22.403 --> 30:23.801
Talking about
my friends, Gil.

30:23.803 --> 30:25.569
- Yeah, yeah, your friends?
- My friends.

30:25.571 --> 30:27.338
Really, yeah, whatever,
your friends.

30:27.340 --> 30:30.041
Where... All the fucking XLs
are gone? Shit.

30:30.043 --> 30:32.743
Hello. How are you?
I'm Matt Wheeler.

30:32.745 --> 30:34.913
It's lovely to meet you
and all your cash.

30:34.915 --> 30:36.115
Wow!

30:36.117 --> 30:38.786
Wow. Is this all the Con cash?

30:40.786 --> 30:43.355
Stop touching shit,
all right?

30:43.357 --> 30:45.523
- This is crazy.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

30:45.525 --> 30:48.761
Your eyes, your eyes,
avert 'em, right here.

30:48.763 --> 30:51.396
This cash that you see?
This is mine.

30:51.398 --> 30:54.332
Your fucking buddy last night
went and drew a big-ass cock

30:54.334 --> 30:56.201
on Adam's car.

30:56.203 --> 30:57.669
He assaulted him.

30:57.671 --> 31:00.504
Keith couldn't assault
a freaking turtle, man.

31:00.506 --> 31:01.973
- Yeah, yeah, right.
- If he did, it's 'cause King

31:01.975 --> 31:04.542
was slapping his balls
time and time again.

31:04.544 --> 31:07.044
I could've had your ass
arrested.

31:07.046 --> 31:09.013
That's right,
but I didn't send you to jail.

31:09.015 --> 31:11.183
- You could've got... What?
- Ten years.

31:11.185 --> 31:13.721
But I did something
a little lighter for you.

31:15.156 --> 31:16.590
You're fired.

31:18.492 --> 31:20.125
You're fucking fired.

31:20.127 --> 31:21.960
And you and your little
loser-ass friends

31:21.962 --> 31:25.330
don't ever, ever come back
to Supercon again.

31:25.332 --> 31:28.133
You're a fucking idiot.
You're banned.

31:28.135 --> 31:31.603
And you'll never work the
Southern cities like, uh...

31:31.605 --> 31:33.137
- Dallas.
- Dallas.

31:33.139 --> 31:34.973
- Houston.
- Houston. You love Houston.

31:34.975 --> 31:36.707
- Dustin.
- Dustin.

31:36.709 --> 31:38.376
- Fucking New Orleans.
- Baton Rouge.

31:38.378 --> 31:39.845
Best seafood in the world.
Baton Rouge.

31:39.847 --> 31:40.944
You're just
throwing out cities.

31:40.946 --> 31:41.849
The boot, bitch.

31:48.254 --> 31:49.689
You're an idiot.

31:51.559 --> 31:53.360
You're banned.

31:55.495 --> 31:56.964
For life.

31:59.233 --> 32:00.831
You know, one of these days,

32:00.833 --> 32:03.667
- all this shit, all of it...
- Yeah?

32:03.669 --> 32:05.270
It's gonna catch up
with you.

32:05.272 --> 32:06.739
Yeah?

32:06.741 --> 32:08.776
And I'm gonna be right there
to see it.

32:28.861 --> 32:31.629
Do you piss or shit
yourself when you get tased?

32:31.631 --> 32:33.397
'Cause you fucking
smell like both.

32:33.399 --> 32:36.568
Speaking of which, I gotta
take the bus back home.

32:36.570 --> 32:38.470
You ever been on
a fucking Greyhound?

32:38.472 --> 32:39.773
Mm-hmm.

32:42.341 --> 32:43.843
Another round, Aaron.

32:44.611 --> 32:47.314
The bartender. That's classy.

32:48.447 --> 32:51.115
Even he has a better shot
than you.

32:51.117 --> 32:53.753
Well, at least we all
got fired together.

32:55.554 --> 32:57.222
What fucking kills me

32:57.224 --> 33:00.291
is that Gil's making
so much money off of everyone,

33:00.293 --> 33:03.528
that he needs the cash machines
from <i>Scarface</i> to count it all.

33:03.530 --> 33:06.598
- It's insane.
- Shit ain't right.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.735
You can't win
if the game's rigged.

33:12.339 --> 33:13.941
I got an idea.

33:18.445 --> 33:21.615
Oh, I hope that's not what
he sounds like when he comes.

33:22.916 --> 33:24.749
Why are we meeting in here?

33:24.751 --> 33:26.818
Because it's a gym
during a comic convention.

33:26.820 --> 33:28.653
This room is safer
than the White House.

33:28.655 --> 33:30.121
Yeah, but what are we
doing in here, Matt?

33:30.123 --> 33:32.089
Hey, I'm not just gonna
blurt it out.

33:32.091 --> 33:33.692
I'm gonna seduce you.

33:33.694 --> 33:35.393
Things are gonna get moist
in here, my friends.

33:35.395 --> 33:36.627
Very moist.

33:36.629 --> 33:38.128
All right, well, spit on it

33:38.130 --> 33:39.132
and put it in already,
for fuck's sakes.

33:44.772 --> 33:46.773
Let's rob Supercon.

33:53.013 --> 33:54.780
- The fuck did he just say?
- Excuse me?

33:54.782 --> 33:56.080
I'm in.

33:56.082 --> 33:57.515
What'd you give him
last night?

33:57.517 --> 33:59.417
Oh, she gave me hope, baby.

33:59.419 --> 34:01.453
We all know
Gil is the motherfucking

34:01.455 --> 34:03.588
Tony Montana of Supercon.

34:03.590 --> 34:05.123
Do you remember
what she said

34:05.125 --> 34:07.157
about the stormtroopers
robbing Dragoncon?

34:07.159 --> 34:08.795
- Yeah.
- We dress up,

34:09.462 --> 34:11.029
we steal the stash,

34:11.031 --> 34:14.032
and we walk out like
nothing every happened.

34:14.034 --> 34:17.735
You wanna steal
everyone's payout money?

34:17.737 --> 34:21.204
- You dick.
- No. That's the sexy part.

34:21.206 --> 34:25.242
Allison, Gil pays out everyone
working the Con Sunday morning,

34:25.244 --> 34:28.212
right before we all start
catching flights or buses home.

34:28.214 --> 34:30.982
He pays out everyone,
except Adam King,

34:30.984 --> 34:34.786
'cause his humongous panel is
Sunday 2 p.m., the last day.

34:34.788 --> 34:37.087
So the only cash left
in the office will be...

34:37.089 --> 34:39.391
- Gil's money.
- And King's money.

34:39.393 --> 34:40.858
Bringo.

34:40.860 --> 34:42.726
I'm in.

34:42.728 --> 34:44.462
Yeah, but the cops will
catch us in a heartbeat.

34:44.464 --> 34:45.831
You bet your flabby ass
they would,

34:45.833 --> 34:47.299
but who's calling
the cops, man?

34:47.301 --> 34:49.134
IRS will be all over him,

34:49.136 --> 34:51.469
plus an audit would show that
he's been skimming off the top

34:51.471 --> 34:52.840
all these years.

34:53.306 --> 34:54.607
I'm in.

34:56.942 --> 34:58.946
You're nuts.

34:59.346 --> 35:00.748
Talk to me.

35:01.415 --> 35:02.713
I'm outta here.

35:02.715 --> 35:04.415
Enjoy your heist there,
Danny Ocean.

35:04.417 --> 35:06.351
- Where you going, little lady?
- I got a bus to catch.

35:06.353 --> 35:08.954
Your idea fucking sucks,
and my ass isn't that flabby.

35:08.956 --> 35:11.755
You didn't even hear the plan,
Casey Affleck.

35:11.757 --> 35:13.058
I heard enough,
and Casey Affleck

35:13.060 --> 35:15.625
is easily the better Affleck.

35:15.627 --> 35:17.130
Later, fuckface.

35:18.364 --> 35:21.734
Go get him. Go get him.

35:24.103 --> 35:25.705
Don't move.

35:33.013 --> 35:35.815
Keith, wait up, you big puss.

35:37.016 --> 35:38.782
At least hear
the plan first, Keith.

35:38.784 --> 35:41.052
You did enough, man,
all right?

35:41.054 --> 35:43.454
You just got me fired from my
only fucking source of income,

35:43.456 --> 35:46.190
and now you want me to go to prison,
for five to ten years? Fuck that.

35:46.192 --> 35:49.393
I needed the fucking money
from this weekend.

35:49.395 --> 35:52.230
Look, your share of the money
from this plan,

35:52.232 --> 35:55.032
you're gonna be a very wealthy
terrorist, my friend.

35:55.034 --> 35:57.268
I don't know if you know this,
but you're a white guy.

35:57.270 --> 36:00.137
You have all the opportunities
in the world in Hollywood.

36:00.139 --> 36:01.306
I don't have shit.

36:01.308 --> 36:02.639
You could be a leading man.

36:02.641 --> 36:04.141
You could be a fucking
supporting role.

36:04.143 --> 36:06.945
You can be a Japanese woman
if you needed to be.

36:06.947 --> 36:08.679
I was a series regular
for five years

36:08.681 --> 36:10.282
on fucking <i>Tex Johnson,</i>

36:10.284 --> 36:12.317
and my parents took
every dime I made.

36:12.319 --> 36:15.052
These conventions are the only
thing that give me any money,

36:15.054 --> 36:17.721
and thanks to you, I don't
even have that anymore.

36:17.723 --> 36:19.389
I haven't worked
in over a fucking year,

36:19.391 --> 36:20.826
and I just lost my agent.

36:21.161 --> 36:22.360
Why?

36:22.362 --> 36:24.094
'Cause she's
a fucking asshole.

36:24.096 --> 36:25.896
She keeps wanting me
to go out for these auditions

36:25.898 --> 36:28.567
for Terrorist Number One
and fucking Cab Driver

36:28.569 --> 36:30.268
and 7-Eleven
and Call Center.

36:30.270 --> 36:31.837
Well, with your share
of the money,

36:31.839 --> 36:33.538
you can buy a 7-Eleven.

36:33.540 --> 36:35.373
I don't need
a fucking 7-Eleven!

36:35.375 --> 36:38.576
I'm not going to jail 'cause
I'll be a fucking candy bar.

36:38.578 --> 36:40.177
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

36:40.179 --> 36:42.813
I'm sorry that every
acting job you go out for

36:42.815 --> 36:44.616
is for some racist shit.

36:44.618 --> 36:46.751
But you can't just walk away.

36:46.753 --> 36:48.386
Who wrote Harry Potter?

36:48.388 --> 36:49.755
Some fucking bitch in England.

36:49.757 --> 36:52.357
You mean J.K. Rowling?

36:52.359 --> 36:53.958
- Yeah, you fucking dork.
- Yeah, thanks!

36:53.960 --> 36:55.995
- J.K. Fucking Rowling.
- Dumbledore!

36:58.697 --> 37:02.632
She wrote that book after her
husband left her stone cold.

37:02.634 --> 37:04.536
J.K. had no money.

37:04.538 --> 37:06.603
J.K. had a baby to feed.

37:06.605 --> 37:08.239
J.K. had to go on welfare.

37:08.241 --> 37:09.741
J.K. didn't rob anybody.

37:09.743 --> 37:11.342
She wrote a children's
fucking book.

37:11.344 --> 37:13.378
J.K. grew some balls.

37:13.380 --> 37:15.380
And that's
what I'm talking about.

37:15.382 --> 37:19.717
'Cause if you walk, the Gils,
the Adam Kings of the world,

37:19.719 --> 37:21.286
they beat you.

37:21.288 --> 37:24.922
It's time for you
to grow some big, hairy...

37:24.924 --> 37:26.726
Harry Potter balls.

37:28.929 --> 37:30.664
Can you do that?

37:36.502 --> 37:38.171
With or without cancer?

37:44.210 --> 37:46.714
You guys know
this is a dumb idea, right?

37:47.413 --> 37:48.646
Oh, yeah, we do.

37:48.648 --> 37:49.949
I'm in.

38:13.172 --> 38:15.373
<i>You forgot one thing, ugly.</i>

38:15.375 --> 38:18.842
<i>Never underestimate
Future Force.</i>

38:18.844 --> 38:21.212
<i>All right, Guardians...</i>

38:21.214 --> 38:23.349
- <i>The bridge is secure.</i>
- Get the door.

38:24.116 --> 38:25.717
Babe, door.

38:25.719 --> 38:27.351
<i>Attack formation
to the hangar.</i>

38:27.353 --> 38:30.087
<i>Sector seven, go.</i>

38:32.592 --> 38:33.994
Hookers can't open doors?

38:37.831 --> 38:39.864
- Hey!
- Oh, it's you.

38:41.935 --> 38:45.001
Hail to the King!

38:45.003 --> 38:47.005
I was looking for you
in your hotel room.

38:47.007 --> 38:49.407
After the party last night,
it was barely habitable.

38:49.409 --> 38:51.842
You're gonna get the bill.
Don't get cheap on me, man.

38:51.844 --> 38:54.047
All right, yeah.

38:54.746 --> 38:56.547
So what's up, Gil?

38:56.549 --> 38:58.819
I thought you said you were
gonna fix things around here.

38:59.485 --> 39:01.184
You know what, Mr. King?

39:01.186 --> 39:03.589
I'll assure you that I'ma
get to the bottom of this.

39:08.427 --> 39:10.994
See, I could've killed you
right there.

39:10.996 --> 39:12.630
You either had your hand
in her ass

39:12.632 --> 39:13.965
or your ass won.

39:13.967 --> 39:16.000
Get your shit together, Gil.

39:16.002 --> 39:18.804
- Yeah, I gotta get it together.
- All right.

39:18.806 --> 39:20.371
So what's the drop, fat man?

39:20.373 --> 39:23.708
Okay, last night,
we made about 45 grand.

39:23.710 --> 39:25.844
That was before the incident.

39:25.846 --> 39:27.378
So we cool, we good.

39:27.380 --> 39:29.279
- No, no.
- We made a little money.

39:29.281 --> 39:32.085
- We looking pretty cool.
- No, not good enough, chief.

39:32.819 --> 39:35.954
Sorry. Jack it up.

39:35.956 --> 39:38.188
We should've made 75 grand
this morning.

39:38.190 --> 39:40.858
Okay, okay, okay,
I understand.

39:40.860 --> 39:43.194
- But you know the fans...
- Fuck the fans.

39:43.196 --> 39:44.596
Those underweight
knuckle-draggers

39:44.598 --> 39:46.230
will pay what I tell them to.

39:46.232 --> 39:49.601
You just...
Gil, you gotta smile at 'em.

39:49.603 --> 39:50.800
All right.

39:50.802 --> 39:52.404
Smile right in their faces,

39:52.406 --> 39:55.572
and you reach around and
grab their wallets, you see?

39:55.574 --> 39:57.407
I like that, I like that.

39:57.409 --> 39:59.009
Now, you know the cons,
we never charge you...

39:59.011 --> 40:01.545
Stop! Shh.

40:01.547 --> 40:04.782
Shh, don't, don't talk,
don't speak.

40:04.784 --> 40:06.386
Say my name.

40:06.918 --> 40:08.987
Adam King.

40:08.989 --> 40:11.221
Tex Johnson, US Marshal.

40:11.223 --> 40:14.393
The Golden Guardian, huh?

40:15.594 --> 40:18.998
Who ordered steak and lobster?

40:19.766 --> 40:21.165
Get your ass in here.

40:21.167 --> 40:23.634
- Come on, motherfucker.
- Food's here.

40:23.636 --> 40:26.237
I have a lobster thermidor

40:26.239 --> 40:28.306
and a porterhouse steak
extra well-done.

40:28.308 --> 40:30.308
- Oh, yeah, all right.
- For your food.

40:30.310 --> 40:33.947
Cristal and beluga. Yeah,
there it is, there it is.

40:34.781 --> 40:37.681
Oh, where's my kiwi?

40:37.683 --> 40:39.616
Babe, what color is kiwi?

40:39.618 --> 40:41.518
Green, like money.

40:41.520 --> 40:42.987
- That green?
- No.

40:42.989 --> 40:44.422
Is that green? No.

40:44.424 --> 40:46.257
- All right, it's green.
- Okay.

40:46.259 --> 40:48.125
Looks like
a big mast of testicle.

40:48.127 --> 40:50.094
- Okay, I'll...
- Kiwi.

40:50.096 --> 40:51.762
- See any kiwi?
- Okay.

40:51.764 --> 40:53.998
- Gil will take care of it.
- Yeah, come on, man.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.599
- Here's the bill.
- Fuck the bill.

40:55.601 --> 40:57.735
Get your ass out.
Come on, Jonathan Winters.

40:57.737 --> 40:59.404
Get your ass outta here.

40:59.406 --> 41:02.105
Fuck you. Get outta here,
Get your ass outta here.

41:02.107 --> 41:03.875
- Yeah, big fan, Mr. King.
- Hey, fuck you.

41:03.877 --> 41:06.744
Your movies got me through
a tough time in my childhood.

41:06.746 --> 41:09.313
Get your ass outta here.
Eat a dick.

41:09.315 --> 41:10.447
Woo, woo!

41:10.449 --> 41:12.916
Yeah, take a number.
Woo, woo.

41:12.918 --> 41:14.819
<i>♪♪ Pop a bottle</i>

41:14.821 --> 41:17.054
<i>♪♪ Pop a bottle on a bitch</i>

41:17.056 --> 41:19.224
- <i>♪♪ Pop a bottle on a bitch</i>
- Woo, woo.

41:19.226 --> 41:21.692
<i>♪♪ Pop a bottle on a bi...</i>

41:21.694 --> 41:24.895
No, I wasn't calling
your girl a bitch.

41:24.897 --> 41:28.232
It's a new song out called
"Pop a Bottle."

41:28.234 --> 41:30.201
- 2 Chainz or one of them.
- Open that.

41:30.203 --> 41:31.237
Okay.

41:33.406 --> 41:36.976
I know you all must have
a ton of questions.

41:37.444 --> 41:38.579
You know, um...

41:39.378 --> 41:41.949
Brock, can you please not...

41:43.116 --> 41:45.516
Brock, just... Not now.

41:45.518 --> 41:47.418
I gotta concentrate.

41:47.420 --> 41:48.920
Time and a place.

41:48.922 --> 41:51.655
I got all the ins and outs
covered, you know that.

41:51.657 --> 41:55.025
Ugh. I hope this plan is
better than your pickup lines.

41:55.027 --> 41:56.726
Don't hold your breath.

41:56.728 --> 42:00.098
Look, we all know that when
King leaves the stage,

42:00.100 --> 42:01.898
he gets the fuck out of Dodge.

42:01.900 --> 42:05.036
But not before he hands Gil
the autograph and photo money.

42:05.038 --> 42:06.203
Exactly.

42:06.205 --> 42:07.804
So we have to get that money

42:07.806 --> 42:09.873
before it gets backstage
and into King's hands.

42:09.875 --> 42:11.310
Did you just...

42:12.744 --> 42:14.579
How do we do it?

42:14.581 --> 42:16.980
<i>We start with Brock
breaking into Gil's office</i>

42:16.982 --> 42:18.648
<i>through the air vents.</i>

42:18.650 --> 42:21.451
<i>When he gets to Gil's office,
he rappels down...</i>

42:21.453 --> 42:23.587
<i>Think first</i>
Mission: Impossible...

42:23.589 --> 42:26.190
- <i>And takes out Callahan...</i>
- <i>Fatality.</i>

42:26.192 --> 42:28.958
<i>Sub-Zero style
from</i> Mortal Kombat.

42:28.960 --> 42:31.929
<i>Allison, you're gonna be
looking like Emilia Clarke</i>

42:31.931 --> 42:34.864
<i>riding in on a fucking dragon.</i>

42:34.866 --> 42:37.335
<i>You lure Gil all the way
to the loading dock.</i>

42:37.337 --> 42:40.637
<i>And just when Gil thinks
he's gonna get lucky,</i>

42:40.639 --> 42:42.540
<i>you drop a lighter
into a puddle of gasoline</i>

42:42.542 --> 42:45.175
<i>that Gil just happens
to be standing in,</i>

42:45.177 --> 42:48.179
<i>turning him into
the Human Torch.</i>

42:50.917 --> 42:53.351
<i>Now, me and Keith
are gonna meet up with Brock.</i>

42:53.353 --> 42:55.820
<i>We crack the safe,
we load up the bags,</i>

42:55.822 --> 42:58.288
<i>and we get the fuck
out of there.</i>

42:58.290 --> 43:00.257
<i>We all meet up out front
of the Con.</i>

43:00.259 --> 43:02.293
<i>We're scot-free.
We celebrate.</i>

43:02.295 --> 43:06.396
<i>Me and Allison make out,
just like she always planned.</i>

43:06.398 --> 43:09.567
That's the plan?
So much wrong with that plan.

43:09.569 --> 43:12.904
You think I'm gonna just
light a man on fire?

43:12.906 --> 43:14.538
What about Adam King?

43:14.540 --> 43:16.440
What about security cameras?
What about Callahan?

43:16.442 --> 43:18.409
What about people seeing
our fucking faces?

43:18.411 --> 43:20.478
Why don't we just do
the stormtropper thing?

43:20.480 --> 43:22.813
Because we're doing an original.
This is not a sequel.

43:22.815 --> 43:25.382
But I'm wearing
a Targaryen princess outfit

43:25.384 --> 43:26.817
for absolutely no reason?

43:26.819 --> 43:28.286
Well, one reason.

43:28.288 --> 43:29.954
I think I could still
catch that bus.

43:29.956 --> 43:33.190
- Well, I'm in.
- Thank you, Brock.

43:33.192 --> 43:37.328
You can still grow some balls
in plan B.

43:37.330 --> 43:39.530
<i>Right before Adam King's
panel starts,</i>

43:39.532 --> 43:41.733
<i>Keith and I will be
on the floor in costumes,</i>

43:41.735 --> 43:43.032
<i>so we won't get caught.</i>

43:43.034 --> 43:44.802
Yeah, bitch.

43:44.804 --> 43:47.103
<i>Callahan will be on guard
outside Gil's office.</i>

43:47.105 --> 43:48.739
<i>Allison,
it's gonna be your job</i>

43:48.741 --> 43:51.241
<i>to seduce Callahan
away from the office.</i>

43:51.243 --> 43:54.177
<i>You do this by having sex
with Callahan.</i>

43:54.179 --> 43:55.813
<i>And in the middle of
that disgusting act,</i>

43:55.815 --> 43:58.849
<i>you knock out Callahan
with a tire iron.</i>

43:58.851 --> 44:01.319
<i>Now, after breaking in
through the air vents,</i>

44:01.321 --> 44:03.686
<i>Brock, you're gonna radio me
and Keith, so we can come in,</i>

44:03.688 --> 44:07.592
<i>grab the cash,
and skedaddlee-do outta there.</i>

44:07.594 --> 44:09.626
<i>Allison, you're gonna
infiltrate, that's right,</i>

44:09.628 --> 44:11.462
<i>infiltrate
the security office</i>

44:11.464 --> 44:13.364
<i>and wipe all
the security footage clean,</i>

44:13.366 --> 44:15.800
<i>wearing a different
sexy cosplay outfit.</i>

44:15.802 --> 44:17.201
<i>Dealer's choice.</i>

44:17.203 --> 44:18.768
<i>We meet up in the parking lot.</i>

44:18.770 --> 44:22.273
<i>We drive off into the sunset
in Bigfoot Number One.</i>

44:23.808 --> 44:27.145
<i>Allison, you and me
make out hard.</i>

44:27.147 --> 44:30.047
<i>Go big, finish big.</i>

44:30.049 --> 44:33.951
Why am I the whore?
Why can't Keith be the whore?

44:33.953 --> 44:36.087
- Well...
- I'll be the whore.

44:36.089 --> 44:38.690
Bigfoot?
What, do you live in the '80s?

44:38.692 --> 44:41.960
Oh, yeah, and on that note, I
cannot drive a monster truck.

44:41.962 --> 44:44.029
You did in <i>Downtown Crime.</i>

44:44.031 --> 44:46.764
That was Gary Jensen,
stuntman.

44:46.766 --> 44:52.436
Not a problem, 'cause I got it
all worked out in plan C.

44:52.438 --> 44:55.405
- Plan C?
- Plan C?

44:55.407 --> 44:56.875
<i>Same thing out front.</i>

44:56.877 --> 44:58.808
<i>Me and Keith are gonna
be on the floor.</i>

44:58.810 --> 45:00.710
<i>Brock, you're in
your favorite place.</i>

45:00.712 --> 45:02.846
<i>Allison, you're still
distracting Callahan,</i>

45:02.848 --> 45:04.681
<i>but you're not
having sex with him.</i>

45:04.683 --> 45:07.050
<i>You just need to get him away
from that door.</i>

45:07.052 --> 45:09.353
<i>You're gonna be hauling ass
over to the security office,</i>

45:09.355 --> 45:11.755
<i>and you're gonna be wiping all
the security footage clean,</i>

45:11.757 --> 45:15.659
<i>wearing a sexy,
tiny Japanese anime number.</i>

45:15.661 --> 45:18.429
<i>Brock rappels down
the air vent.</i>

45:18.431 --> 45:20.398
<i>He unlocks the door
for me and Keith.</i>

45:21.032 --> 45:22.632
<i>We crack the safe,</i>

45:22.634 --> 45:25.402
<i>we load up all the bags
and get the heck outta there.</i>

45:25.404 --> 45:27.137
<i>We meet at the getaway car,</i>

45:27.139 --> 45:28.940
<i>Lee Harvey Oswald's
favorite target practice,</i>

45:28.942 --> 45:31.241
<i>a cherry Lincoln Continental.</i>

45:31.243 --> 45:32.876
Hold up.

45:32.878 --> 45:35.945
I'm not happy about being
on security detail,

45:35.947 --> 45:37.415
but I'll do it.

45:37.417 --> 45:38.949
But you're in
for the outfits, right?

45:38.951 --> 45:41.386
Problem is,
if we wipe the security cams,

45:41.388 --> 45:44.956
we can't keep track of Adam
King and Gil on the floor.

45:44.958 --> 45:46.991
Not a problem.
We got Brock in the air vents.

45:46.993 --> 45:48.759
Cover all our asses.

45:48.761 --> 45:51.228
Where are these cars
coming from?

45:51.230 --> 45:53.230
It's my plan, man.
I get to pick the cars.

45:53.232 --> 45:54.532
Hey, I got an idea.

45:54.534 --> 45:56.900
Why don't we
just take a shuttle bus?

45:56.902 --> 46:00.137
This plan you speak of
is full of holes.

46:00.139 --> 46:01.807
Shut up, Matt.

46:02.842 --> 46:07.110
However, I think
we can really do this.

46:07.112 --> 46:09.248
Guys, we gonna do this?

46:09.748 --> 46:10.884
I'm in.

46:13.219 --> 46:14.521
I'm in.

46:17.958 --> 46:20.594
It's like the tip of my cock
in your ass, Matt.

46:21.360 --> 46:22.696
I'm in.

46:24.897 --> 46:26.096
Yes!

46:26.098 --> 46:28.099
We still need one more person

46:28.101 --> 46:29.333
just to keep their
eyes on Gil.

46:29.335 --> 46:30.737
And King.

46:34.906 --> 46:36.642
I have an idea.

46:40.279 --> 46:43.179
- I really should've been Obama.
- Why?

46:43.181 --> 46:46.449
I don't know, it looks like
they outsourced Trump's hands.

46:46.451 --> 46:47.985
Where the hell is Brock?

46:47.987 --> 46:49.320
Right here.

46:49.322 --> 46:52.223
What, this old thing?

46:52.225 --> 46:53.493
Watch it.

46:54.226 --> 46:55.759
Kirby taught me...

46:55.761 --> 46:56.927
There's our guy.

46:56.929 --> 46:58.362
How to be more dramatic,

46:58.364 --> 47:00.697
how to make things
bigger than life,

47:00.699 --> 47:03.134
and he was absolutely right.

47:03.136 --> 47:05.335
Kirby was a wonderful man.

47:05.337 --> 47:07.337
I mean, he taught me so much.

47:07.339 --> 47:08.808
Um, Sid, hi.

47:11.310 --> 47:13.210
- Allie bear.
- Rrr.

47:13.212 --> 47:16.146
Hi. Love this disguise.

47:16.148 --> 47:18.616
It's a Louise Brooks
sort of goth nerd?

47:18.618 --> 47:20.951
It's Louise Brooks-ish, yeah.

47:20.953 --> 47:24.922
Everybody, this is my favorite
artist working today,

47:24.924 --> 47:28.090
Allison McNealy,
and she is great.

47:28.092 --> 47:31.529
Oh, by the way, great work
on your book <i>Battle Worlds.</i>

47:31.531 --> 47:33.764
It's fantastic. Great, kiddo.

47:33.766 --> 47:34.898
Thanks.

47:34.900 --> 47:36.536
Thank you, Sid.

47:37.802 --> 47:40.570
Willie Nelson
is playing a concert.

47:40.572 --> 47:42.674
Sorry, hon.
I'm a little deaf.

47:43.543 --> 47:45.576
Willie Nelson
is playing a concert.

47:45.578 --> 47:49.382
This is... That's Vietnam,
so you have to speak loud.

47:50.549 --> 47:52.451
We've got great weed.

47:53.252 --> 47:55.855
Guys, back in 20!

48:03.830 --> 48:07.230
How much of this shit
have you kids been smoking?

48:07.232 --> 48:08.801
Not enough.

48:12.806 --> 48:13.871
Whoa!

48:13.873 --> 48:16.907
Hey, you're in <i>Silicon Valley.</i>

48:16.909 --> 48:19.677
- <i>Parks and Rec.</i>
- Oh, that's not as funny.

48:19.679 --> 48:21.348
I mean, it's still good.

48:22.281 --> 48:24.248
I guess it's good.

48:24.250 --> 48:26.884
Sid, come on,
what do you think?

48:26.886 --> 48:28.886
- You in?
- I don't know, folks.

48:28.888 --> 48:32.588
I'm still trying to wrap
my head around this thing.

48:32.590 --> 48:35.893
Which does not make it
not the right thing to do.

48:35.895 --> 48:38.429
I have a longer, darker
history with Adam King

48:38.431 --> 48:40.396
than you kids know about.

48:40.398 --> 48:42.465
Back in '79,

48:42.467 --> 48:45.335
my lovely ex-wife,
God rest her soul,

48:45.337 --> 48:47.137
warned me
that he was gonna screw me

48:47.139 --> 48:52.409
on the <i>Future Force</i> TV deal,
which he did.

48:52.411 --> 48:54.911
Had to fight for years
to get the rights back,

48:54.913 --> 48:57.681
spent a small fortune
doing it.

48:57.683 --> 49:02.552
Now I just wanna
share stories with fans,

49:02.554 --> 49:06.893
and not with the inmates
of cell block D.

49:09.996 --> 49:14.797
I grew up reading your comics,
Mr. Newberry.

49:14.799 --> 49:18.735
What made your comics great
wasn't the superheroes.

49:18.737 --> 49:21.672
Your books were about
human morality

49:21.674 --> 49:24.007
wrapped in a superhero cape.

49:24.009 --> 49:25.809
When those pages
were open, man,

49:25.811 --> 49:28.145
I didn't think about
being the weird kid,

49:28.147 --> 49:31.681
I didn't think about Tito Lopez
kicking my ass in the fourth grade.

49:31.683 --> 49:35.119
When I was reading your books,
I wasn't alone.

49:35.121 --> 49:36.820
That's it. The people
who come to these cons,

49:36.822 --> 49:38.956
and I'm talking about
all of us,

49:38.958 --> 49:42.628
this is where
we don't feel alone.

49:45.098 --> 49:46.833
The Adam Kings of the world?

49:48.234 --> 49:49.601
The Gils?

49:50.636 --> 49:52.571
They're robbing that from us.

49:53.339 --> 49:54.739
They overcharge,

49:54.741 --> 49:57.543
and they treat the fans
like shit.

49:59.511 --> 50:00.946
Sid...

50:01.880 --> 50:04.384
We wanna take it back
for the fans.

50:21.567 --> 50:26.704
You know, either this grass
is really, really good,

50:26.706 --> 50:29.306
or this kid just
monologued me.

50:29.308 --> 50:30.940
Sid.

50:30.942 --> 50:32.946
Listen, that was very good.
I wish I had a pen.

50:34.580 --> 50:37.380
Sid, is that a yes?
Is that a yes?

50:37.382 --> 50:39.951
You're great kids,

50:39.953 --> 50:43.052
and Adam King is
an incredible asshole,

50:43.054 --> 50:45.590
but unfortunately,
he makes up a major part

50:45.592 --> 50:48.692
of my retirement income,

50:48.694 --> 50:51.697
so you see,
he's my necessary evil.

50:54.900 --> 50:57.433
Let's do another book soon.

50:57.435 --> 50:58.971
Good luck, guys.

50:59.873 --> 51:00.940
Sid...

51:02.775 --> 51:04.643
Can you at least
think about it?

51:05.643 --> 51:08.679
Not if I smoke
any more of that weed.

51:08.681 --> 51:11.382
I'm gonna go play
some Allman Brothers.

51:11.384 --> 51:13.586
Oops, sorry.

51:14.753 --> 51:16.656
Thought this was
the hentai room.

51:20.793 --> 51:22.895
Dare I ask about a plan D?

51:23.395 --> 51:25.295
Who has a plan D?

51:25.297 --> 51:26.666
Obviously not you.

51:29.368 --> 51:34.704
Oh, oh, Mr. King!
Mr. King!

51:34.706 --> 51:37.474
Mr. King, can I please
have your autograph?

51:37.476 --> 51:40.610
Sure, big guy, anything
for a <i>Future Force</i> fan.

51:40.612 --> 51:42.579
You're my hero.

51:42.581 --> 51:44.782
- Oh, I love your work, man.
- I bet you do.

51:44.784 --> 51:47.018
It's pretty good,
isn't it? Yeah.

51:47.020 --> 51:49.018
All right, there ya go.
75 bucks, bro.

51:49.020 --> 51:50.922
Oh, my sister's
at the restaurant.

51:50.924 --> 51:52.755
I don't have any money.

51:52.757 --> 51:54.761
I just thought you could
give it for me for free.

51:55.761 --> 51:58.030
Oh, I don't...
I just thought...

51:59.232 --> 52:02.333
Golden Guardian doesn't
work for free, kid.

52:02.335 --> 52:05.601
You can have this when you go
into your sister's purse,

52:05.603 --> 52:07.237
steal 75 bucks.

52:07.239 --> 52:10.273
Got it right here for ya,
all right?

52:10.275 --> 52:12.476
Yeah. Let's go, babe.

52:12.478 --> 52:14.047
Bye-bye now.

52:16.147 --> 52:17.280
Oh.

52:17.282 --> 52:18.717
Think fast.

52:21.085 --> 52:24.156
I can't believe who they
let in these things anymore.

52:26.125 --> 52:27.558
You dick!

52:31.496 --> 52:32.996
Motherfucker!

52:32.998 --> 52:35.599
Hey, Sid Newberry,
you're still alive, huh?

52:35.601 --> 52:38.134
Good for you, good for you.

52:38.136 --> 52:41.540
You know,
that's not his real name.

52:44.444 --> 52:48.581
Yeah, I can't ride a bike, and
I can't roller-skate either.

52:55.721 --> 52:58.154
Sid! I knew you'd come back.

52:58.156 --> 52:59.690
How'd you find us?

52:59.692 --> 53:03.128
I just came in
for some more of that weed.

53:12.203 --> 53:14.204
Thanks.

53:14.206 --> 53:15.639
You know you don't have to keep
on working when you get fired.

53:15.641 --> 53:18.409
Mm. This one's for me.

53:18.411 --> 53:19.942
Really? You made me Adam King?

53:19.944 --> 53:21.378
You're not Adam King.

53:21.380 --> 53:25.318
Golden Guardian,
our fearless leader.

53:27.618 --> 53:29.453
Fearless leader.

53:29.455 --> 53:32.157
That's one thing
I've never been accused of.

53:34.360 --> 53:36.062
Uh-oh.

53:40.333 --> 53:42.099
There it is.

53:42.101 --> 53:44.867
Hey, I feel like you're about
to bestow us some wisdom.

53:44.869 --> 53:46.302
Here's some wisdom.

53:46.304 --> 53:49.206
I just wish you guys
would just fuck already.

53:49.208 --> 53:50.875
- Whoa, whoa.
- Don't do it for me.

53:50.877 --> 53:52.842
Do it for you.

53:55.781 --> 53:57.614
I just want you guys to fuck.

53:57.616 --> 53:59.049
Just get it out of the way,

53:59.051 --> 54:03.154
and then we can be
all normal again.

54:03.156 --> 54:06.125
Can you believe this is possibly
our last night of freedom?

54:08.927 --> 54:11.998
This is the best night
of my life.

54:12.732 --> 54:14.300
I believe you.

54:18.571 --> 54:20.971
The night was mighty dark,

54:20.973 --> 54:22.942
so you could hardly see.

54:24.275 --> 54:26.678
And the moon
refused to shine.

54:31.083 --> 54:35.355
There was this couple sitting
underneath the willow tree.

54:36.822 --> 54:38.157
For love...

54:39.525 --> 54:41.094
For love, they pined.

54:44.063 --> 54:47.764
The little maid was
kinda 'fraid of darkness,

54:47.766 --> 54:49.935
so she said,

54:50.969 --> 54:52.672
"I guess I'll go."

54:56.074 --> 54:59.043
The boy began to sigh.

54:59.045 --> 55:02.112
He looked up in the sky,

55:02.114 --> 55:07.317
and he told the moon
his little tale of woe.

55:07.319 --> 55:08.951
He said...

55:08.953 --> 55:10.820
<i>♪♪ Shine on</i>

55:10.822 --> 55:14.757
<i>♪♪ Shine on, harvest moon</i>

<i>♪♪ Up in the sky</i>

55:17.830 --> 55:22.132
<i>♪♪ I ain't had no loving since</i>

55:22.134 --> 55:26.869

56:28.266 --> 56:30.400
You know if we get nailed,

56:30.402 --> 56:33.536
I just ruined the lives of four
people I really care about.

56:33.538 --> 56:34.771
True.

56:34.773 --> 56:36.440
Do you think you
and this crew

56:36.442 --> 56:39.875
can handle 10 years
in a maximum security prison?

56:39.877 --> 56:43.212
You heard Keith. He's happy for
the first time since he was 12.

56:43.214 --> 56:45.382
Brock is clearly loving it.

56:45.384 --> 56:48.221
Sid's finally
part of a superhero team.

56:49.188 --> 56:50.820
So?

56:50.822 --> 56:52.525
In or out, Wheeler?

56:55.594 --> 56:59.496
If that's not Adam King, and
I'm now the Golden Guardian,

56:59.498 --> 57:01.799
you gotta make my package
way bigger.

57:01.801 --> 57:03.268
Just sayin'.

57:19.284 --> 57:21.284
Okay, guys,
we all know the plan.

57:21.286 --> 57:23.554
Until we actually
touch the money,

57:23.556 --> 57:25.655
we haven't done
anything illegal.

57:25.657 --> 57:28.023
We're just LARPing.

57:28.025 --> 57:29.427
That's the story.

57:57.121 --> 57:59.623
Yeah.

57:59.625 --> 58:01.491
There you are.

58:14.806 --> 58:16.905
Still got any body oil?

58:16.907 --> 58:19.610
Body oil. Babe!

59:13.965 --> 59:16.266
Good luck.

59:16.268 --> 59:19.969
I feel like that was a reference
to something I should know.

59:19.971 --> 59:21.538
- This is it.
- See ya in a few.

59:21.540 --> 59:22.541
All right.

59:22.940 --> 59:24.206
Yo, Wheeler.

59:24.208 --> 59:26.610
- Yeah.
- Don't fuck this up,

59:26.612 --> 59:29.282
there might be something waiting
for you at the end of it.

59:33.219 --> 59:35.186
Motherfucker.

59:40.891 --> 59:42.194
Boom!

59:51.335 --> 59:53.272
- All right.
- We have a hole.

59:58.710 --> 01:00:00.108
That's quite a hole.

01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:02.378
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Not bad.

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:03.980
- Speaking of.
- Wait.

01:00:03.982 --> 01:00:05.382
You couldn't just be
a cat burglar.

01:00:05.384 --> 01:00:07.250
You had to be
a sexy cat burglar?

01:00:07.252 --> 01:00:08.751
This was the only outfit
I could find on the floor

01:00:08.753 --> 01:00:10.654
that fit the job.

01:00:10.656 --> 01:00:11.755
Are you wearing heels?

01:00:11.757 --> 01:00:13.188
Yes, I am.

01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:15.324
Well, more of a go-go boot,
but yes.

01:00:15.326 --> 01:00:16.793
Where the fuck
is your harness?

01:00:16.795 --> 01:00:18.161
It's underneath.

01:00:18.163 --> 01:00:19.730
Want me to ruin this line?

01:00:19.732 --> 01:00:21.465
Well, you working it, pussycat.
Come over here.

01:00:21.467 --> 01:00:23.800
Thank you, Matt.

01:00:23.802 --> 01:00:25.569
Let's give you some light.

01:00:25.571 --> 01:00:28.270
Must be so tight on my junk
'cause it feels very good.

01:00:28.272 --> 01:00:30.473
- It's a natural tea bag.
- Thank you.

01:00:30.475 --> 01:00:33.610
Oh, God, wait!
Those are my balls! Please!

01:00:33.612 --> 01:00:35.746
You're touching my taint!
Get outta my taint!

01:00:35.748 --> 01:00:38.681
- That's my face.
- Oh, sorry. Can you smell that?

01:00:38.683 --> 01:00:40.416
Go, Brock, go!

01:00:40.418 --> 01:00:43.386
It's like being a suppository
in the anus of hell.

01:00:43.388 --> 01:00:45.723
I can't believe
that you got...

01:00:45.725 --> 01:00:46.857
Oh, shit!

01:00:47.993 --> 01:00:49.759
- I'm fine.
- Brock!

01:00:49.761 --> 01:00:51.728
It's good? Huh?

01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:53.329
Help.

01:00:53.331 --> 01:00:54.898
I mean,
just stay where you are.

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.102
Okay.

01:00:56.601 --> 01:00:57.601
Jesus!

01:00:57.603 --> 01:00:59.302
Can you feel
your legs?

01:00:59.304 --> 01:01:01.237
I've got legs?

01:01:01.239 --> 01:01:02.973
Let's just get
him the bags.

01:01:02.975 --> 01:01:06.344
Just stay where you...
Throw me the bags!

01:01:08.746 --> 01:01:10.248
Oh!

01:01:13.085 --> 01:01:14.353
Thanks.

01:01:15.453 --> 01:01:16.351
Okay.

01:01:30.668 --> 01:01:33.904
Let us know when
the eagle has left the nest.

01:01:33.906 --> 01:01:35.605
I'm fogging up
faster than a teenager

01:01:35.607 --> 01:01:38.340
in the back seat
of a Honda Civic.

01:01:38.342 --> 01:01:40.413
Be thankful
you're not wearing a turban.

01:01:45.817 --> 01:01:47.116
You know, 40 years...

01:01:47.118 --> 01:01:49.184
Ooh!

01:01:49.186 --> 01:01:51.721
38 movies,
2 television shows,

01:01:51.723 --> 01:01:55.324
and you are by far the worst
sound guy I've ever worked with.

01:01:55.326 --> 01:01:56.525
I mean, seriously,
look at this.

01:01:56.527 --> 01:01:58.397
Looks like I have a hernia.

01:02:00.498 --> 01:02:02.301
You giving me a hand job now?

01:02:03.902 --> 01:02:05.434
Hi, gents.

01:02:05.436 --> 01:02:07.936
Do you guys mind
if I hang back here,

01:02:07.938 --> 01:02:09.338
see the big panel?

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:11.440
I just love to see
the fans' faces

01:02:11.442 --> 01:02:13.442
when they talk about
<i>Future Force.</i>

01:02:13.444 --> 01:02:14.945
Yeah, well,
that makes one of us.

01:02:14.947 --> 01:02:16.512
You want me
to get this guy, King?

01:02:16.514 --> 01:02:17.915
- Who the fuck...
- Ah, that's okay.

01:02:17.917 --> 01:02:19.181
It's all right.
He's harmless.

01:02:19.183 --> 01:02:20.449
Aren't you, Sid?

01:02:20.451 --> 01:02:21.884
Glad you're still my fan

01:02:21.886 --> 01:02:24.322
after all those lawyers
got through with ya.

01:02:25.257 --> 01:02:27.858
Boy, he's asking for it.

01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:31.094
Oh, now it looks like I have
R2D2 hanging from my balls.

01:02:31.096 --> 01:02:33.165
- Seriously?
- Sorry, sir.

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.898
Come on, beat it, Pepe.
Get outta here.

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:39.201
Yep, you know, I haven't
killed a man since Vietnam,

01:02:39.203 --> 01:02:41.837
but that may change today.

01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:44.142
Here you go, honey.
You're welcome.

01:02:49.748 --> 01:02:52.251
I can give you this handheld
mic, if you'd rather.

01:02:53.518 --> 01:02:56.253
You mean this was an option
the entire time?

01:02:56.255 --> 01:02:58.154
I'm sorry.
I just thought that...

01:02:59.857 --> 01:03:01.226
Oh, my God.

01:03:13.272 --> 01:03:15.337
<i>You know him
as Tex Johnson,</i>

01:03:15.339 --> 01:03:17.306
<i>you know him as
the Golden Guardian,</i>

01:03:17.308 --> 01:03:22.145
<i>it's the one, the only,
Adam King!</i>

01:03:37.862 --> 01:03:39.397
Yes!

01:03:42.134 --> 01:03:43.836
Yes!

01:03:45.703 --> 01:03:47.603
Look at us.
What a great crowd.

01:03:47.605 --> 01:03:49.337
I think this is the biggest
crowd so far at the Con.

01:03:49.339 --> 01:03:50.674
Isn't it? Right?

01:03:53.811 --> 01:03:55.311
I know it is.

01:03:55.313 --> 01:03:56.846
They sold too many tickets,
you know,

01:03:56.848 --> 01:03:59.348
but there's a line
all the way around

01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:01.016
this huge, uh...

01:04:01.018 --> 01:04:02.819
This huge convention center.

01:04:02.821 --> 01:04:05.822
It goes all the way around.
You people are the lucky ones.

01:04:05.824 --> 01:04:08.558
The eagle is in flight.
King's onstage.

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.661
I got eyeballs on Gil.
We're good to go.

01:04:11.663 --> 01:04:13.295
<i>Allison, you're up.</i>

01:04:13.297 --> 01:04:15.466
<i>Get Callahan off that door.</i>

01:04:16.201 --> 01:04:17.770
What are you doing here

01:04:18.302 --> 01:04:22.840
all by yourself?

01:04:38.456 --> 01:04:40.322
Nothing's working.

01:04:40.324 --> 01:04:42.058
<i>He's gotta be a terminator.</i>

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:44.027
No red-blooded male
can resist that.

01:04:44.029 --> 01:04:45.895
<i>He's gay.</i>

01:04:45.897 --> 01:04:50.366
<i>That UFC macho shithead
bullshit isn't fooling anybody.</i>

01:04:50.368 --> 01:04:51.601
<i>He's gay as a goose.</i>

01:04:51.603 --> 01:04:54.170
Puts the dump in cumdump.

01:04:54.172 --> 01:04:56.773
He's so gay,
he puts an S in turtle.

01:04:56.775 --> 01:05:01.011
Damn light's not working.
Damn this piece of shit.

01:05:01.013 --> 01:05:03.882
I'm above the office.
Get in here.

01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:07.616
We should've got Brock
for this.

01:05:07.618 --> 01:05:10.654
I see, I see
a bunch of Xenas here.

01:05:10.656 --> 01:05:12.489
Look, yeah,
there's one up there.

01:05:12.491 --> 01:05:14.824
Ooh, very nice.
You should move down in front.

01:05:14.826 --> 01:05:17.094
Very good.

01:05:17.096 --> 01:05:21.331
Ah, Lucy. Do we love Lucy?
Do we all love Lucy Lawless?

01:05:21.333 --> 01:05:23.666
I met Lucy
many, many years ago.

01:05:23.668 --> 01:05:25.735
Of course, she wasn't
Lucy Lawless then.

01:05:25.737 --> 01:05:28.505
She was Lucy Kiwi...
I don't know.

01:05:28.507 --> 01:05:32.675
This statuesque,
remarkably clear-skinned girl

01:05:32.677 --> 01:05:35.779
comes up and gets her diploma,
and I said, "Who is that?"

01:05:35.781 --> 01:05:39.047
She was, boy, barely 18,
I think, and she was...

01:05:39.049 --> 01:05:42.418
- Guys, Gil's starting to move.
- <i>Stall him, Sid.</i>

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:43.886
- How?
- <i>The Elvis story.</i>

01:05:43.888 --> 01:05:45.855
Gil, I just wanted
to thank you

01:05:45.857 --> 01:05:48.458
for letting me hang back here
and watch King in action.

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:49.592
I really appreciate it.

01:05:49.594 --> 01:05:51.360
No problem, Sid, no problem.

01:05:51.362 --> 01:05:53.429
Which, by the way,
speaking of King,

01:05:53.431 --> 01:05:55.165
did I ever tell you
about the time

01:05:55.167 --> 01:06:00.070
that Elvis and I nearly died
in a private plane crash?

01:06:00.072 --> 01:06:01.737
No.

01:06:01.739 --> 01:06:04.074
When the scene was over,
which got a little steamy,

01:06:04.076 --> 01:06:05.541
the director yelled cut,

01:06:05.543 --> 01:06:07.476
she looked down at me,
and she said...

01:06:07.478 --> 01:06:09.746
Whoa!

01:06:09.748 --> 01:06:13.148
"Yes! You are the King!"

01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:15.018
Don't stop me
if you've heard this story.

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:18.320
July 4th of 1971, yeah,
'cause it was right after

01:06:18.322 --> 01:06:20.489
Elvis did his big
comeback special,

01:06:20.491 --> 01:06:22.925
the one with
the black leathers.

01:06:22.927 --> 01:06:25.228
- Uh-huh
- Anyway, we're on the plane,

01:06:25.230 --> 01:06:27.697
Sonny and Red and me and E,

01:06:27.699 --> 01:06:30.433
and all of a sudden,
on the way back to Memphis,

01:06:30.435 --> 01:06:33.770
the Colonel just brings out
this huge bag of mushrooms.

01:06:33.772 --> 01:06:35.739
- What?
- I mean, just incredible.

01:06:35.741 --> 01:06:38.741
Don't you think people are
too hard on the new DC movies?

01:06:38.743 --> 01:06:41.344
You know what I really love
about the new Supes?

01:06:41.346 --> 01:06:43.947
What's that?

01:06:43.949 --> 01:06:46.949
Red undies on the inside
because, you know...

01:06:46.951 --> 01:06:49.351
Hey, Sid, I gotta go.
Have a good one.

01:06:49.353 --> 01:06:51.357
Sick bastard.

01:06:51.924 --> 01:06:53.723
Douche nozzle.

01:06:53.725 --> 01:06:55.958
Okay, you guys, we lost him.
I can't hold him.

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.494
The walrus
is back in the water.

01:06:59.496 --> 01:07:01.398
<i>Allison, do whatever you gotta do,</i>

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.831
<i>but do it right now.</i>

01:07:02.833 --> 01:07:04.069
Copy.

01:07:06.404 --> 01:07:08.036
Did you just call me ma'am?

01:07:08.038 --> 01:07:10.373
Do I look like a ma'am
to you, dickhead?

01:07:10.375 --> 01:07:11.708
No, I wasn't trying...

01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:13.442
Does this ass look
like a ma'am to you?

01:07:13.444 --> 01:07:15.277
- Ma'am, you have to leave.
- Oh, you just said it again.

01:07:15.279 --> 01:07:18.114
I don't have to do anything.
What is this, Nazi Germany,

01:07:18.116 --> 01:07:21.884
you goose-stepping, leg-day
skipping Hitler wannabe?

01:07:21.886 --> 01:07:23.819
- What?
- You heard me, Ferrigno.

01:07:23.821 --> 01:07:25.755
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
- What?

01:07:25.757 --> 01:07:27.389
You get to tell me what to do
just 'cause I'm a woman?

01:07:27.391 --> 01:07:28.692
You got a dick?

01:07:28.694 --> 01:07:31.962
No, no, no, no,
you jackboot-wearing

the early 1980s.

what, just about every week,

01:17:37.401 --> 01:17:39.368
tell the same old
tired stories,

01:17:39.370 --> 01:17:41.002
fleece these kids
for all their worth.

01:17:41.004 --> 01:17:43.171
On a certain level,
I think that's totally fine.

01:17:43.173 --> 01:17:44.974
You get what you want,
and that's great,

01:17:44.976 --> 01:17:47.310
and I guess they get
what you think they want.

01:17:47.312 --> 01:17:50.845
And I understand you are at the
top of Convention Mountain,

01:17:50.847 --> 01:17:53.482
But I gotta tell you, it's not
always gonna be that way.

01:17:53.484 --> 01:17:57.819
What you thought the fans
wanted wasn't what they wanted.

01:17:57.821 --> 01:17:59.688
What they wanted
was a connection.

01:17:59.690 --> 01:18:02.157
And you never had
a connection

01:18:02.159 --> 01:18:05.760
with any of the people that
you've spent all this time with.

01:18:05.762 --> 01:18:09.598
You can't even open your eyes
to the enjoyment

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.134
that your talent gave
to your fans.

01:18:12.136 --> 01:18:14.136
So my prediction for you

01:18:14.138 --> 01:18:17.038
is unpleasantness
in the days to come.

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:21.711
My prediction for you is not
much force in your future.

01:18:21.713 --> 01:18:26.348
Now, do you think I am
fucking lying to you?

01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:29.451
Do you think I am
fucking with you?

01:18:29.453 --> 01:18:33.357
'Cause I'll tell you,
I am not fucking with you.

01:18:37.261 --> 01:18:39.661
Adam, we need to talk, man.

01:18:39.663 --> 01:18:42.230
No, listen, it's all right.
I was just busting his balls.

01:18:42.232 --> 01:18:43.435
Oh, God!

01:18:45.503 --> 01:18:48.170
Damn! What was that all about?

01:18:48.172 --> 01:18:51.672
It's okay. What...
What's the issue?

01:18:51.674 --> 01:18:54.576
Son of a bitch!

01:18:54.578 --> 01:18:57.579
- What'd they look like?
- Fuckin' Future Gold.

01:18:57.581 --> 01:18:59.280
One of 'em's gold,
one of 'em's purple.

01:18:59.282 --> 01:19:00.782
I know what
the Future Fucks look like.

01:19:00.784 --> 01:19:02.818
- Grab the intern, get my money.
- Copy that.

01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:04.920
I didn't spend a whole weekend
shaking hands

01:19:04.922 --> 01:19:06.788
and signing shit
for these assholes for free.

01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:08.791
- I'll take it out of your hide.
- Out of my...

01:19:08.793 --> 01:19:10.524
<i>We regret to inform you</i>

01:19:10.526 --> 01:19:12.694
<i>that Supercon
is officially over.</i>

01:19:12.696 --> 01:19:14.462
<i>We are closing the doors.</i>

01:19:14.464 --> 01:19:15.730
Who the fuck gave them
authority to do that?

01:19:15.732 --> 01:19:17.600
Shut up, shut up.

01:19:17.602 --> 01:19:19.600
Somebody on your team has
their head out of their ass.

01:19:19.602 --> 01:19:22.770
That means there's only one
way out for these pricks now.

01:19:22.772 --> 01:19:25.408
Close all the doors.
No exceptions! None!

01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:27.612
- Come on.
- No exceptions.

01:19:40.190 --> 01:19:41.823
Get outta my way!

01:19:41.825 --> 01:19:43.727
- VIP coming through!
- Hey!

01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:48.563
<i>We regret to inform you</i>

01:19:48.565 --> 01:19:51.033
<i>that Supercon
is officially over.</i>

01:19:51.035 --> 01:19:52.501
<i>We are closing the doors.</i>

01:19:52.503 --> 01:19:54.802
<i>Please make your way
to the main exit</i>

01:19:54.804 --> 01:19:57.275
<i>at the front
of the convention center.</i>

01:20:04.947 --> 01:20:06.551
My turn, asshole!

01:20:08.852 --> 01:20:09.984
Nut check.

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:25.635
Go, go, go! I got this.

01:20:25.637 --> 01:20:27.502
Fuck that.
I'm not leaving without you.

01:20:27.504 --> 01:20:29.037
I will find you. Go, go.

01:20:29.039 --> 01:20:32.409
No. I'll never be the same
without you.

01:20:41.052 --> 01:20:43.188
My God.

01:20:43.986 --> 01:20:45.653
Who's there?

01:20:45.655 --> 01:20:49.091
Help me! Somebody there?
Somebody give me a towel.

01:20:49.093 --> 01:20:50.595
A wet wipe?

01:20:51.529 --> 01:20:52.994
Maybe a napkin?

01:20:52.996 --> 01:20:55.329
Somebody? Who's there?

01:20:55.331 --> 01:20:57.399
Oh, my God.

01:20:57.401 --> 01:20:59.370
It's in my mouth.

01:21:00.271 --> 01:21:01.903
Oh, my God, who's there?

01:21:01.905 --> 01:21:03.507
Help me!

01:21:03.907 --> 01:21:05.642
Help me!

01:21:06.843 --> 01:21:11.582
When I say "scat,"
I mean get away.

01:21:14.418 --> 01:21:15.984
Who's there? Who's there?

01:21:15.986 --> 01:21:17.755
Oh, my God.

01:21:18.454 --> 01:21:20.357
I want my mother.

01:21:25.295 --> 01:21:28.329
Allison, don't worry
about Brock. I got him.

01:21:28.331 --> 01:21:31.434
Gather our stuff and let's
get the hell outta Dodge.

01:21:31.436 --> 01:21:32.904
Thanks, Sid, you're the best.

01:21:52.557 --> 01:21:54.892
Hey, you...

01:22:22.953 --> 01:22:24.586
Okay.

01:22:24.588 --> 01:22:26.220
Hey, I got a question.
Where'd you get that suit?

01:22:26.222 --> 01:22:27.922
My son loves this show.
He thinks it's awesome.

01:22:27.924 --> 01:22:29.891
You see Adam King?
That guy was dynamite.

01:22:29.893 --> 01:22:32.394
LARPing, right? We were
just talking about this.

01:22:32.396 --> 01:22:34.395
It's incredible. Just smile.

01:22:34.397 --> 01:22:36.431
Last picture this guy will ever
have with a full set of teeth.

01:22:36.433 --> 01:22:38.801
All right, hold on, tough guy.
We'll get to you in a minute.

01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:41.903
All right, okay, all right.

01:22:41.905 --> 01:22:44.607
Uh, you know
where the hentai room is?

01:22:44.609 --> 01:22:46.108
The wife, she's into all that.

01:22:47.578 --> 01:22:49.010
Oh, sorry for interrupting.
I'm sorry.

01:22:49.012 --> 01:22:51.683
Get back to your stupid...
Let's go.

01:22:56.853 --> 01:22:59.488
You are not gonna believe

01:22:59.490 --> 01:23:01.689
how shitty the camera
on my phone is,

01:23:01.691 --> 01:23:04.525
'cause this was totally
so blurry.

01:23:04.527 --> 01:23:07.229
One more, one more.

01:23:07.231 --> 01:23:08.896
All right, get in there.

01:23:08.898 --> 01:23:09.797
Hentai!

01:23:09.799 --> 01:23:12.000
Fantastic.

01:23:12.002 --> 01:23:15.304
Hey, what do you got
that big sword for, big guy?

01:23:15.306 --> 01:23:16.872
Pick on this little guy?

01:23:16.874 --> 01:23:18.140
You're gonna kick his ass
anyway. Who cares?

01:23:18.142 --> 01:23:19.308
Just drop the sword.

01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:21.309
Come on!

01:23:21.311 --> 01:23:23.511
Nice. Thank you.

01:23:23.513 --> 01:23:25.814
He is gonna kill you.
Let's go.

01:23:25.816 --> 01:23:27.819
Thank you very much,
gentlemen.

01:23:38.829 --> 01:23:41.432
Come with me
if you want to live.

01:23:43.032 --> 01:23:44.099
Nice.

01:23:44.101 --> 01:23:45.734
Go, go, go!

01:23:45.736 --> 01:23:48.269
I got a bad feeling
about this.

01:23:48.271 --> 01:23:49.473
Yeah!

01:23:50.941 --> 01:23:53.574
King! Love the weave!

01:23:53.576 --> 01:23:56.577
Like this?

01:23:56.579 --> 01:23:58.247
Oh, shit!

01:23:58.249 --> 01:24:00.314
Keith! Keith!

01:24:00.316 --> 01:24:01.518
I'm okay.

01:24:02.119 --> 01:24:03.618
You're an idiot.

01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:05.653
Hey! Watch where you're going,
assholes!

01:24:05.655 --> 01:24:06.921
Yeah, he can't drive, man.

01:24:06.923 --> 01:24:08.960
Boys, don't forget
your backpacks.

01:24:10.093 --> 01:24:11.696
Thanks, Ms. Lily.

01:24:16.534 --> 01:24:18.934
Holy shit, you're Adam King.
Can I get your autograph?

01:24:18.936 --> 01:24:21.702
Where are those
sons of bitches?

01:24:21.704 --> 01:24:24.372
There. There they are.
Come on.

01:24:24.374 --> 01:24:25.806
They're getting away!

01:24:25.808 --> 01:24:27.509
Not before I kill 'em.
Bitches, move.

01:24:27.511 --> 01:24:29.711
- Get in there.
- I can't drive no car.

01:24:29.713 --> 01:24:32.247
- Shut up! Get in there!
- The fuck is this, man?

01:24:32.249 --> 01:24:36.385
I can't even drive a stick.

01:24:36.387 --> 01:24:37.822
Go!

01:24:42.692 --> 01:24:45.226
- Come on!
- Hey, what the fuck you doin'?

01:24:45.228 --> 01:24:46.728
- Hey!
- Come on, Gil.

01:24:46.730 --> 01:24:49.998
- You gonna kill us.
- Drive, you son of a...

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.766
You see what he
did to my hair?

01:24:51.768 --> 01:24:53.734
Your hair was
already fucked up.

01:24:53.736 --> 01:24:55.806
They put their hands on me.

01:24:59.042 --> 01:25:02.543
Go! What's the matter with you?
You crazy?

01:25:02.545 --> 01:25:04.746
There they are.

01:25:04.748 --> 01:25:06.681
I got 'em.
I got their ass.

01:25:06.683 --> 01:25:08.449
Come on, man, accelerate!

01:25:08.451 --> 01:25:10.185
What the... Hey!

01:25:10.187 --> 01:25:11.252
Yeah, right here.

01:25:11.254 --> 01:25:13.287
- Help!
- Yeah!

01:25:13.289 --> 01:25:14.691
Help!

01:25:15.592 --> 01:25:17.725
Okay, okay, okay, slow down.

01:25:17.727 --> 01:25:20.095
It not working.
It not working!

01:25:22.665 --> 01:25:24.832
What the fuck?

01:25:24.834 --> 01:25:27.469
Oh! Get me outta this shit!

01:25:27.471 --> 01:25:29.438
You call the police.

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.671
No! I'm getting the fuck
outta here!

01:25:30.673 --> 01:25:32.640
Smartphone?

01:25:32.642 --> 01:25:36.144
TMZ would pay a fortune, no?

01:25:36.146 --> 01:25:38.148
I'm gonna kill
these guys!

01:25:40.383 --> 01:25:41.984
Gimme that shit.

01:25:41.986 --> 01:25:44.021
Where's the fucking
money at, man?

01:25:47.090 --> 01:25:50.059
- Where's the shit?
- Where's my money?

01:25:50.061 --> 01:25:51.792
- Where the fuck is the money?
- I don't know.

01:25:51.794 --> 01:25:53.595
Just play it cool, Keith.

01:25:53.597 --> 01:25:55.262
- Hey, hey, shit!
- Where's my money?

01:25:55.264 --> 01:25:56.463
What money?

01:25:56.465 --> 01:25:58.033
My money, you...

01:25:58.035 --> 01:26:00.835
Went all weekend
collecting this stuff, man.

01:26:00.837 --> 01:26:02.637
Why were you guys
running then, huh?

01:26:02.639 --> 01:26:04.139
'Cause you two fucks
fired us.

01:26:04.141 --> 01:26:06.073
- Adam.
- Just shut the fuck up, Gil.

01:26:06.075 --> 01:26:09.211
Look, I know you two
stole my money.

01:26:09.213 --> 01:26:11.345
You think I'd come here
on the weekends

01:26:11.347 --> 01:26:15.250
and sign stuff for these sweaty
bastards because I want to?

01:26:15.252 --> 01:26:18.853
Because I crave their attention?
Because I want their approval?

01:26:18.855 --> 01:26:21.489
No. I'm Adam Fucking King.

01:26:21.491 --> 01:26:24.259
That shit is Sid's job with
his little fucking bow tie

01:26:24.261 --> 01:26:26.394
and his suspenders
and his shitty toupee.

01:26:26.396 --> 01:26:29.098
I'm Adam King!
Where's my fucking money?

01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:30.799
You think there's room
in these outfits

01:26:30.801 --> 01:26:32.835
for your greedy money,
you shithead?

01:26:32.837 --> 01:26:34.970
- Well, let's find out.
- Hey, whoa!

01:26:34.972 --> 01:26:36.270
Here, Mr. King, here.
That should cover them.

01:26:36.272 --> 01:26:37.473
What is this?

01:26:37.475 --> 01:26:38.940
It's for a photo op with you.

01:26:38.942 --> 01:26:40.375
I'm sure these guys
meant to pay you,

01:26:40.377 --> 01:26:42.010
but that's all I have left.

01:26:42.012 --> 01:26:43.811
Your prices were a little
outrageous this year,

01:26:43.813 --> 01:26:45.712
- if I do say so myself.
- Are you kidding me?

01:26:45.714 --> 01:26:49.251
I'm talking hundreds of thousands
of dollars they stole.

01:26:49.253 --> 01:26:50.685
Hundreds of thousands.

01:26:50.687 --> 01:26:52.119
I don't have it, man.

01:26:52.121 --> 01:26:54.255
Make sure you all
get my good side.

01:26:54.257 --> 01:26:56.891
God knows you morons
don't have one.

01:26:56.893 --> 01:26:59.760
- Let's get the fuck outta here.
- Look at yourselves!

01:26:59.762 --> 01:27:03.265
Painted faces,
rhinestones everywhere.

01:27:03.267 --> 01:27:05.333
Stupid costumes! God!

01:27:05.335 --> 01:27:08.369
I got it all, and that's
the way it's gonna stay.

01:27:08.371 --> 01:27:11.640
I see any of this on the
Internet, I'll sue you all!

01:27:11.642 --> 01:27:13.177
I'm Adam Fucking King!

01:27:13.611 --> 01:27:15.580
Future Force!

01:27:16.379 --> 01:27:17.479
Shazam.

01:27:17.481 --> 01:27:18.979
- Yeah.
- Hey.

01:27:18.981 --> 01:27:21.282
Oh, wow,
a Future Force helmet.

01:27:21.284 --> 01:27:22.751
This is for me?

01:27:22.753 --> 01:27:24.288
The future is yours.

01:27:24.588 --> 01:27:26.123
Cool.

01:27:27.057 --> 01:27:29.627
Hey, aren't you
the ball cancer kid?

01:27:30.259 --> 01:27:32.327
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

01:27:32.329 --> 01:27:33.730
Nice.

01:27:35.999 --> 01:27:38.166
Oh, so sweaty inside.

01:27:38.168 --> 01:27:41.435
Ugh! And it stinks!

01:27:41.437 --> 01:27:43.873
Ugh! Like ball cancer.

01:27:46.043 --> 01:27:48.309
Don't even ask.
The money's gone.

01:27:48.311 --> 01:27:49.844
Oh, my God, Brock.

01:27:49.846 --> 01:27:52.650
Not another word, Matt.
Not another word.

01:28:02.659 --> 01:28:06.797
You guys didn't think you'd
get away that easy, did you?

01:28:11.368 --> 01:28:12.734
No way.

01:28:12.736 --> 01:28:14.068
Ms. Lily?

01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:16.637
I gotta hand it to you guys.

01:28:16.639 --> 01:28:18.540
You sure made
this Fourth of July fun,

01:28:18.542 --> 01:28:21.842
even if I did have to dig
Brock out of the bathroom.

01:28:21.844 --> 01:28:23.246
That was you?

01:28:28.317 --> 01:28:29.917
Don't worry.
That's all yours.

01:28:29.919 --> 01:28:32.119
- I already took my share.
- What?

01:28:32.121 --> 01:28:34.989
Well, I put a little extra
in there for Keith.

01:28:34.991 --> 01:28:37.326
If I hadn't drawn
that big cock on King's car,

01:28:37.328 --> 01:28:39.094
Gil probably wouldn't
have fired you.

01:28:39.096 --> 01:28:40.895
I felt just a tad bit
responsible.

01:28:40.897 --> 01:28:42.866
Yeah, but how did you...

01:28:45.235 --> 01:28:46.771
Duh.

01:28:47.637 --> 01:28:49.704
You mean J.K. Rowling?

01:28:49.706 --> 01:28:51.142
Thanks, Dumbledore.

01:29:00.183 --> 01:29:04.719
We regret to inform you that
Supercon is officially over.

01:29:06.222 --> 01:29:10.091
- Help me!
- Thank you, Ms. Lily.

01:29:10.093 --> 01:29:11.760
I did that Dragoncon job

01:29:11.762 --> 01:29:14.162
because who's gonna
put Ms. Lily,

01:29:14.164 --> 01:29:16.930
loved, adored, respected,
children's show host

01:29:16.932 --> 01:29:18.699
behind bars?

01:29:18.701 --> 01:29:21.802
Besides, it's a hell of a rush
being more bad than good.

01:29:21.804 --> 01:29:24.008
Right now
we gotta get outta here.

01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:26.341
And, sweetie...

01:29:26.343 --> 01:29:29.777
My couch pulls out,
but you don't have to.

01:29:29.779 --> 01:29:31.212
Oh, snap.

01:29:32.414 --> 01:29:34.916
Well done, lady.

01:29:34.918 --> 01:29:37.288
You guys did amazing.

01:29:38.489 --> 01:29:39.824
Yeah, her too.

01:29:40.690 --> 01:29:43.324
Oh, oh, my God.

01:29:43.326 --> 01:29:44.928
Not one word.

01:29:46.896 --> 01:29:48.363
I was number four!

01:29:48.365 --> 01:29:52.300
Number four sexiest man
in the world, 1982.

01:29:52.302 --> 01:29:54.601
You know what?
Fuck the fans.

01:29:54.603 --> 01:29:58.239
I'm done with all you fucking
hairless fanboys.

01:29:58.241 --> 01:30:00.210
I think you got it backwards.

01:30:00.977 --> 01:30:02.644
We're done with you!

01:30:02.646 --> 01:30:06.614
Oh, the mouth-breather speaks.
What'd you say?

01:30:06.616 --> 01:30:08.917
Yeah, fuck you, Adam King!

01:30:08.919 --> 01:30:11.118
Yeah, you supposed to be
treating the fans

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:12.988
with love and loyalty,

01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:14.622
and you treat the fans
like that?

01:30:14.624 --> 01:30:17.759
Fuck you! Supercon
don't want your ass either!

01:30:17.761 --> 01:30:21.296
Supercon's done with
your old KFC-looking ass.

01:30:21.298 --> 01:30:23.163
You would never
try to screw anyone

01:30:23.165 --> 01:30:25.600
out of their
hard-earned money,

01:30:25.602 --> 01:30:27.170
would you, Gil?

01:30:27.670 --> 01:30:30.005
Douche nozzle!

01:30:30.007 --> 01:30:31.573
Little motherfucker.

01:30:31.575 --> 01:30:34.475
Are you all getting
good shots for free?

01:30:34.477 --> 01:30:35.976
This should cost you.

01:30:35.978 --> 01:30:38.479
Geez, you all are pathetic.
Look at you.

01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:42.650
What are you laughing about?

01:30:42.652 --> 01:30:44.219
What, you think this is funny?

01:30:44.221 --> 01:30:46.054
What is the matter
with you people?

01:30:46.056 --> 01:30:48.122
Liberace, you know him?

01:30:48.124 --> 01:30:50.425
He hit on me four times.

01:30:50.427 --> 01:30:52.827
What has happened
to this country?

01:30:52.829 --> 01:30:54.195
You wanna be me.

01:30:54.197 --> 01:30:56.131
All you women
wanna be with me.

01:30:56.133 --> 01:30:59.399
You see, I have something
you all don't have.

01:30:59.401 --> 01:31:01.936
You know what it is?
Power!

01:31:01.938 --> 01:31:04.874
I'm the power of a celebrity,
and you...

01:31:15.052 --> 01:31:18.355
Rule number one...
Don't fuck with the fans.

01:31:20.124 --> 01:31:23.524
Told you that car
was a piece of shit.

01:31:23.526 --> 01:31:25.092
Don't mess with me!

01:31:25.094 --> 01:31:27.298
Don't mess with the King.

01:31:32.235 --> 01:31:35.503
<i>Hey, NerdGasm! Rob, Sean.</i>

01:31:35.505 --> 01:31:37.270
<i>We just got back from
Supercon, and holy shit,</i>

01:31:37.272 --> 01:31:39.877
<i>Adam King lost his mind!</i>

01:31:42.044 --> 01:31:43.677
<i>Social retards.</i>

01:31:43.679 --> 01:31:47.448
<i>You're 180 degrees
of pathetic copycats.</i>

01:31:47.450 --> 01:31:51.219
<i>While you all are beating off
in your grandparents' garage,</i>

01:31:51.221 --> 01:31:52.720
<i>I'm gonna be banging
a supermodel.</i>

01:31:52.722 --> 01:31:54.655
<i>What do you
think of that, huh?</i>

01:31:54.657 --> 01:31:56.625
<i>Sean can't even get
his fucking helmet off.</i>

01:31:56.627 --> 01:31:59.597
<i>My whole world is blowing.
It's going like this.</i>

01:32:02.031 --> 01:32:03.832
<i>What do you know?
J.J. Abrams?</i>

01:32:03.834 --> 01:32:06.400
<i>He sent me the script
for</i> Lost, <i>right?</i>

01:32:06.402 --> 01:32:08.903
<i>What a stupid name.
Then I fired his ass.</i>

01:32:08.905 --> 01:32:12.239
<i>We don't know what's happening.
Like shit is crazy.</i>

01:32:12.241 --> 01:32:14.275
<i>We got fucking kids
stealing shit.</i>

01:32:14.277 --> 01:32:16.711
<i>Everybody, steal some shit.
He doesn't have cameras here.</i>

01:32:16.713 --> 01:32:19.014
<i>Come down to Lickety Split
and steal some shit.</i>

01:32:19.016 --> 01:32:21.082
<i>You know Joss Whedon?</i>

01:32:21.084 --> 01:32:23.216
- <i>Joss?</i>
- <i>Yeah, we know Joss.</i>

01:32:23.218 --> 01:32:25.653
<i>I'm the guy that told him
to drop the H,</i>

01:32:25.655 --> 01:32:27.555
<i>so he would stand out.</i>

01:32:27.557 --> 01:32:30.558
<i>Joss Whedon owes me
his entire career.</i>

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:32.260
<i>That was actually
a pretty good suggestion.</i>

01:32:32.262 --> 01:32:34.195
<i>Yeah, it was, wasn't it?</i>

01:32:34.197 --> 01:32:35.963
<i>What are you, the sweatiest
man in the world?</i>

01:32:35.965 --> 01:32:37.399
<i>What's up, YouTube?</i>

01:32:37.401 --> 01:32:39.333
<i>Adam King
at the end of Supercon.</i>

01:32:39.335 --> 01:32:43.240
<i>He makes Mel Gibson look like
a freaking pre-school teacher.</i>

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:47.542
<i>Carrie Fisher and I
got to second base.</i>

01:32:47.544 --> 01:32:50.679
<i>I was drunk. You know
who she is, don't you?</i>

01:32:50.681 --> 01:32:51.915
<i>Duh!</i>

01:32:53.115 --> 01:32:54.783
<i>Adam King is fucked.</i>

01:32:54.785 --> 01:32:56.818
<i>He just stepped into
a big vat of shit.</i>

01:32:56.820 --> 01:32:58.219
<i>Supercon is done.</i>

01:32:58.221 --> 01:33:00.757
<i>The future is fucked. Forced.</i>

01:33:02.258 --> 01:33:04.693
<i>You think that David O.
Russell shit was something?</i>

01:33:04.695 --> 01:33:06.161
<i>Wait till you see this.</i>

01:33:06.163 --> 01:33:08.195
<i>We are going to sell
this shit to TMZ,</i>

01:33:08.197 --> 01:33:09.831
<i>and we're going to be rich!</i>

01:33:09.833 --> 01:33:11.198
<i>I cannot wait for it.</i>

01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:19.040
<i>Warren Beatty is my wingman.</i>

01:33:19.042 --> 01:33:20.841
<i>Hasselhoff's a pussy.</i>

01:33:20.843 --> 01:33:24.114
<i>I got it all, and that's
the way it's gonna stay.</i>

01:33:24.746 --> 01:33:26.350
<i>Fuck the fans.</i>

01:34:07.924 --> 01:34:10.026
Hey, watch it!

01:34:14.364 --> 01:34:16.229
You're Lizzie Fisher?

01:34:16.231 --> 01:34:18.332
I love your movies so much.

01:34:18.334 --> 01:34:21.101
Can I have your autograph?

01:34:21.103 --> 01:34:23.270
Princesses don't
work for free, kid.

01:34:23.272 --> 01:34:24.704
Let's go.

01:34:26.810 --> 01:34:28.275
Let's go get you drunk.

01:34:28.277 --> 01:34:29.543
I knew there was a reason
I liked you.
