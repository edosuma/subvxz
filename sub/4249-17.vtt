- YEAH, WEIRD ONES.

12:51.812 --> 12:56.775
IT WAS ALL IN MY HEAD,
BUT STILL...

12:56.859 --> 12:59.153
- WELL, YOU'RE SAFE NOW,
AND YOU DID IT!

12:59.236 --> 13:00.905
- OKAY, LET'S SEE

13:00.988 --> 13:03.324
WHAT FROBISHER-SMYTHE
HAS IN STORE FOR US NEXT.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.492
- FOR NINA...

13:04.575 --> 13:06.619
- FOR THE MASK...

13:06.702 --> 13:08.579
- FOR SIBUNA.

13:28.265 --> 13:31.393
- NO WAY.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.062
- THIS JUST KEEPS
GETTING WEIRDER.

13:33.145 --> 13:38.567
- I'M DETECTING
A DEFINITE THEME IN HERE.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.070
- NEITH...

13:41.153 --> 13:43.531
THE SPIDER-HEADED
WEAVER GODDESS OF WAR.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.199
- WEAVERS OF WAR.

13:45.282 --> 13:47.576
YEAH, 'CAUSE THOSE TWO
GO TOGETHER REALLY WELL.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.745
- LOOK AT THAT SPIDER
OVER THERE.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.622
IT LOOKS LIKE AN INDENTATION.

13:51.705 --> 13:53.874
I THINK SOMETHING GOES IN THERE.

13:53.958 --> 13:57.461
- I'M HOPING NOT
A GIANT SPIDER.

14:00.422 --> 14:01.674
- WEIRD.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.469
- THAT'S WHERE
WE HAVE TO GET TO.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.263
- SO LET'S GO THEN.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.515
[all shouting]

14:09.598 --> 14:11.183
AH, THAT REALLY HURT!

14:11.267 --> 14:13.811
- IT'S LIKE A BEE STING.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.729
- OR A SPIDER BITE.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.608
- I THINK THERE'S
SOME KIND OF VENOM

14:19.692 --> 14:22.486
ON ALL THE THREADS.

14:22.570 --> 14:23.612
WHAT ARE THOSE?

14:23.696 --> 14:27.700
SOME KIND OF...HOOKS?

14:35.541 --> 14:37.084
- HOOKS.

14:37.167 --> 14:37.960
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'RE FOR?

14:42.715 --> 14:43.632
LET'S JUST CALL IT
A NIGHT, GUYS.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.802
WE'LL COME BACK TOMORROW.

14:46.885 --> 14:49.972
- TOMORROW.
OKAY.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.348
I HAVE THIS WEIRD FEELING

14:51.432 --> 14:53.851
I'M GOING TO BE ILL
AROUND ABOUT THEN.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.318
- SO DID YOU FIND YOUR GRAN?

15:02.401 --> 15:03.819
- YEAH, SHE'S FINE.

15:03.902 --> 15:05.863
I MEAN, I KNEW SHE WOULD BE.

15:05.946 --> 15:06.655
I JUST NEED TO HEAR HER VOICE,

15:06.739 --> 15:07.865
AND ON THE PHONE THIS TIME,

15:07.948 --> 15:10.576
NOT IN SOME CREEPY
TUNNEL OF TERROR.

15:10.659 --> 15:11.493
- YOU WERE SCARED.
THAT'S ALL.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.997
THE MIND PLAYS TRICKS.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.498
- YEAH, IT'S JUST...

15:16.582 --> 15:17.708
- JUST WHAT?

15:17.791 --> 15:19.668
- I CAN'T HELP THINKING

15:19.752 --> 15:21.086
IT MEANT MORE THAN THAT.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.549
- HOW'S THE STAKEOUT GOING?

15:25.633 --> 15:27.718
- NOT GOOD, MY FRIEND.

15:27.801 --> 15:28.927
NOT GOOD AT ALL.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.680
I'VE BEEN WATCHING SWEETIE
ALL MORNING.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.058
DO YOU KNOW HE LEAVES
HIS OFFICE, ON AVERAGE,

15:34.141 --> 15:34.767
THREE TIMES AN HOUR?

15:34.850 --> 15:37.019
- I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

15:37.102 --> 15:40.189
- HE'S GONE FOR APPROXIMATELY
4 MINUTES, 42 SECONDS.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.482
AND DO YOU FURTHER NOT KNOW

15:41.565 --> 15:44.693
THAT HE LEAVES HIS OFFICE
UNLOCKED, ON AVERAGE,

15:44.777 --> 15:46.403
NONE OF THOSE TIMES?

15:46.487 --> 15:48.405
- OH, YOU'RE REALLY
ROCKING THOSE STATS.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.324
- I MEAN, WHAT DOES HE THINK
IS GONNA HAPPEN

15:50.407 --> 15:53.535
IF HE LEAVES IT OPEN
FOR FOUR MINUTES?

15:53.619 --> 15:56.038
- DUDES LIKE US
WILL COME IN AND TAKE STUFF.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.999
- TRUE; THAT IS WHY WE HAVE
TO THINK UP A WILD GOOSE CHASE

15:59.083 --> 16:01.418
TO GET SWEET OUT AND ME IN.

16:01.502 --> 16:05.047
- WILD GOOSE CHASE, EH?

16:05.130 --> 16:06.048
GOT IT COVERED.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.341
- YOU HAVE?
WHAT IS IT?

16:07.424 --> 16:08.592
- DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT IT,
BUDDY.

16:08.676 --> 16:09.718
I'LL ARRANGE EVERYTHING.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.554
JUST SIT BACK AND PREPARE
TO BE AMAZED.

16:12.638 --> 16:13.972
- GOOD AMAZED OR BAD AMAZED?

16:14.056 --> 16:15.432
- EH, AMAZED AMAZED.

16:24.149 --> 16:27.611
- EW, WHAT'S THAT
AWFUL STINK?

16:27.695 --> 16:31.407
- IT'S ONLY MANURE.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.700
- YOU JUST LEAVE IT LYING AROUND

16:32.783 --> 16:34.743
LIKE THAT'S A TOTALLY NORMAL
THING TO DO?

16:34.827 --> 16:38.455
- I WANT ALL OF THIS SPREAD
ON THE FLOWER BEDS.

16:38.539 --> 16:39.373
AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE FINISHED

16:39.456 --> 16:42.751
YOU MAY RETURN
TO YOUR LESSONS.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.586
- THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT, VICTOR?

16:44.670 --> 16:47.381
LIKE, HA-HA, GOOD ONE, YEAH?

16:47.464 --> 16:50.050
- I DON'T MAKE JOKES.
- YOU DON'T MAKE JOKES.

16:53.470 --> 16:54.888
I'M NOT DOING IT.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.640
EVERYONE HAS THEIR LIMITS,

16:56.724 --> 16:58.809
A LINE THEY MUST DRAW
IN THE SAND.

16:58.892 --> 17:00.102
- OR THE MANURE.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.480
COME ON.

17:28.672 --> 17:32.760
- SONJA OF HORRORS.

17:45.939 --> 17:46.774
- IT'S NOT THAT BAD,
YOU KNOW,

17:46.857 --> 17:49.401
THE EXERCISE, THE FRESH AIR.

17:49.485 --> 17:53.322
- IT'S NOT EXACTLY FRESH,
THOUGH, IS IT?

17:53.405 --> 17:55.741
OHH, GROSS.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.079
WHAT?!

18:01.163 --> 18:01.955
- WHY WOULD YOU--
YOU'RE SO--

18:02.039 --> 18:03.832
- COME ON, IT'S A PERFECTLY

18:03.916 --> 18:05.083
LEGITIMATE PRACTICAL JOKE,

18:05.167 --> 18:06.460
CONSIDERING THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

18:06.543 --> 18:08.253
I MEAN, IT'D BE A CRIME
NOT TO.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.214
- BUT THESE
ARE MY BADDEST SHOES.

18:10.297 --> 18:15.761
- OKAY, HERE, FINE.
I'LL FIX IT.

18:15.844 --> 18:17.346
"BADDEST SHOES."

18:17.429 --> 18:18.138
CAN'T TAKE A JOKE.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.519
- [laughing]

18:23.602 --> 18:25.437
AND BY THE WAY, YOU'VE GOT
SOMETHING JUST THERE.

18:25.521 --> 18:30.108
[laughing]

18:30.192 --> 18:31.026
- ACTUALLY,
COULD YOU HELP ME UP?

18:31.109 --> 18:32.861
- UH, NO, YOU WOULDN'T DARE.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.071
YOU WOULDN'T ACTUALLY DARE--

18:34.154 --> 18:35.197
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST STEP--

18:35.280 --> 18:36.365
- BUT I'M NOT.

18:50.629 --> 18:53.715
- NOW, THEN...

18:53.799 --> 18:55.509
WHERE'S THAT AMULET?

19:11.191 --> 19:12.776
[phone ringing]

19:12.860 --> 19:15.279
- MR. SWEET SPEAKING.

19:17.656 --> 19:18.907
- GREAT.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.579
- HEY, COME ON.

19:27.165 --> 19:28.625
WELL, IT TOOK
A BIT OF ORGANIZING, BUT...

19:28.709 --> 19:29.793
- ALFIE, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

19:29.877 --> 19:32.921
[honking]

19:33.005 --> 19:34.715
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE, ALFIE?

19:34.798 --> 19:36.049
PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T TELL ME

19:36.133 --> 19:37.426
WHAT I KNOW
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.094
- YOU SAID YOU WANTED
A WILD GOOSE CHASE,

19:39.177 --> 19:41.680
SO I GOT A WILD GOOSE.

19:41.763 --> 19:44.892
WELL, A CAGED ONE.
BUT IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH, RIGHT?

19:44.975 --> 19:46.602
- YOU REALLY HAVE!

19:46.685 --> 19:47.311
WHERE DID YOU GET IT?

19:47.394 --> 19:49.104
- ALFIE KNOWS PEOPLE.

19:49.187 --> 19:50.564
- BUT ALFIE, BUDDY,

19:50.647 --> 19:53.025
"WILD GOOSE CHASE,"
IT'S A FIGURE OF SPEECH.

19:53.108 --> 19:54.610
- YEAH, BUT THAT'S
WHAT GOT ME THINKING.

19:54.693 --> 19:55.611
DOES IT HAVE TO BE?

19:55.694 --> 19:56.820
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THIS THING

19:56.904 --> 19:58.155
STARTED RUNNING
AROUND THE SCHOOL?

19:58.238 --> 19:59.781
- MASS PANIC.
PANDEMONIUM!

19:59.865 --> 20:03.660
- EXACTLY.
AND WHO WOULD COME RUNNING?

20:03.744 --> 20:05.120
- MR. SWEET.

20:05.203 --> 20:06.413
- AND WITH ALL THE CONFUSION,
YOU KNOW,

20:06.496 --> 20:09.333
I DOUBT HE'D EVEN HAVE TIME
TO LOCK HIS DOOR.

20:09.416 --> 20:10.626
- LET THE WILD GOOSE CHASE
BEGIN.

20:10.709 --> 20:13.837
[honking]

20:47.579 --> 20:49.289
- AH.
[laughing]

20:53.251 --> 20:54.962
THERE YOU ARE.

21:01.134 --> 21:05.681
[shouting, honking]

21:05.764 --> 21:08.141
- ALFIE, YOU ARE
ACTUALLY A GENIUS.

21:08.225 --> 21:12.187
[chaotic shouting]

21:12.270 --> 21:14.272

21:14.356 --> 21:16.775
THAT'S A GOOSE!

21:16.858 --> 21:19.027
BE CAREFUL, ALFIE.
IT'LL BITE.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.405
COME ON, GOOSEY, COME ON.

21:47.764 --> 21:48.974
- SIR, IT'S FINE!

21:49.057 --> 21:50.684
[goose honking]

21:50.767 --> 21:54.646

21:54.730 --> 21:56.023
[girl screams]

22:00.610 --> 22:02.029
GOT YOU.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.741
