Look out! Coming through!

<c.speakerTop>-[sheep baas]
-[grunts]

01:09.291 --> 01:10.583
<c.speaker>Whoo!

01:12.000 --> 01:13.291
<c.speakerTop>Princess Elena!

01:13.291 --> 01:14.875
<c.speakerTop>You forgot
your welcome speech.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.250
<c.speakerTop>You said you wanted
to practice.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.458
<c.speakerTop>Oh, and I need
your signature

01:17.458 --> 01:19.375
<c.speakerTop>on this order
for more flowers.

01:19.375 --> 01:20.416
<c.speaker>And I brought
a little snack

01:20.416 --> 01:21.625
<c.speaker>to get you
through the afternoon.

01:21.625 --> 01:23.833
<c.speaker>Wow. Thanks, Armando.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.458
<c.speaker>What would we do
without you?

01:25.458 --> 01:26.875
<c.speaker>Oh, I'd be speechless.

01:26.875 --> 01:28.375
<c.speaker>And I'd be snackless.

01:28.375 --> 01:29.333
<c.speaker>Mm!

01:29.333 --> 01:31.333
<c.speaker>Looks good.

01:31.333 --> 01:33.375
<c.speaker>How's everything else
coming along?

01:33.375 --> 01:36.291
<c.speaker>Well, everyone's excited
you're bringing back
the All Kingdoms Fair.

01:36.291 --> 01:38.250
<c.speaker>Merchants, artists,
and musicians

01:38.250 --> 01:40.625
<c.speaker>are coming from
all over the EverRealm.

01:40.625 --> 01:44.458
<c.speaker>Oh, that reminds me.
We need confetti
for the opening ceremony.

01:44.458 --> 01:46.875
<c.speaker>[laughs]
Don't you ever take a break?

01:46.875 --> 01:48.958
<c.speaker>I don't rest
until you do, Princess.

01:48.958 --> 01:51.500
<c.speaker>Aww. Well, I'm very proud
of you, Armando.

01:51.500 --> 01:54.708
<c.speaker>You've really
become an excellent
Chief of the Castle.

01:54.708 --> 01:56.458
<c.speaker>And it only took
you two years.

01:56.458 --> 01:57.625
<c.speaker>Hmm.

01:57.625 --> 01:59.416
<c.speaker>Well,
it was worth the wait.

01:59.416 --> 02:02.000
<c.speaker>Now let's go see
about that confetti.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.333
<c.speaker>You're already planning
your victory party, Doña Paloma?

02:05.333 --> 02:08.583
<c.speaker>Yeah, the Magister
of Trade election
is, like, a week away.

02:08.583 --> 02:12.250
<c.speaker>[laughs] That's
just a formality, really.

02:12.250 --> 02:14.708
<c.speaker>Nobody ever runs against me.

02:14.708 --> 02:16.333
<c.speaker>And do you know why?

02:16.333 --> 02:17.708
<c.speaker>They're scared of her.

02:17.708 --> 02:19.583
<c.speaker>They love me.

02:19.583 --> 02:21.166
<c.speaker>And who can blame them?

02:21.166 --> 02:22.583
<c.speaker>I'm doing a fabulous job.

02:22.583 --> 02:24.583
<c.speaker>You don't mess
with success.

02:24.583 --> 02:27.750
<c.speaker>12 years, I have been
Magister of Trade.

02:27.750 --> 02:31.833
<c.speaker>12 years, making
alliances and representing
Avalor's merchants.

02:31.833 --> 02:36.125
<c.speaker>And the kingdom has gotten
wealthier every year.

02:36.125 --> 02:38.416
<c.speaker>Almost as wealthy as Doña.

02:38.416 --> 02:40.166
<c.speaker>Here, Martín.

02:40.166 --> 02:42.166
<c.speaker>Make yourself useful
and load the confetti cannons.

02:42.166 --> 02:44.291
<c.speaker>Oh, perfect! That's
actually why we're here.

02:44.291 --> 02:46.125
<c.speaker>We need a dozen baskets.

02:46.125 --> 02:49.458
<c.speaker>Oh, I'm afraid this confetti
is already spoken for.

02:49.458 --> 02:52.375
<c.speaker>By me.
For my victory party.

02:52.375 --> 02:54.958
<c.speaker>Which you all
are cordially invited to.

02:54.958 --> 02:57.458
<c.speaker>Any chance you can spare
a little for the fair?

02:57.458 --> 02:59.375
<c.speaker>Sorry, but no.

02:59.375 --> 03:01.750
<c.speaker>-[horses neigh]
-[Naomi] Bummer.

03:01.750 --> 03:03.458
<c.speaker>It's not much
of a parade without confetti.

03:03.458 --> 03:06.208
<c.speaker>Don't worry,
it's just a little glitch.

03:06.208 --> 03:08.625
<c.speaker>Hmm. Oh, I know a guy
at the paper mill.

03:08.625 --> 03:10.458
<c.speaker>He'll give us
all the confetti we need.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.083
<c.speaker>I knew you'd come through.

03:12.083 --> 03:15.375
<c.speaker>You're like
our royal Glitch Fixer!

03:17.583 --> 03:21.583
<c.speaker>Wow. Look at all the RSVPs
for the All Kingdoms Fair!

03:21.583 --> 03:23.833
<c.speaker>I'll start adding
them to the list.

03:23.833 --> 03:25.250
<c.speaker>What would
we do without you?

03:25.250 --> 03:26.333
<c.speaker>[gasp]

03:28.375 --> 03:31.333
<c.speaker>I'm afraid you're gonna
have to do the Fair without me.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.416
<c.speaker>Armando? What
are you talking about?

03:33.416 --> 03:37.000
<c.speaker>Santos Gutierrez is coming
to the All Kingdoms Fair

03:37.000 --> 03:38.875
<c.speaker>to sell cheese
from his dairy farm?

03:38.875 --> 03:40.833
<c.speaker>Who's Santos Gutierrez?

03:40.833 --> 03:42.833
<c.speaker>[sigh] My brother.

03:42.833 --> 03:45.583
<c.speaker>Your brother's coming?!
Ah, I can't wait to meet him!

03:45.583 --> 03:47.125
<c.speaker>Is he just like you?

03:47.125 --> 03:48.875
<c.speaker>He's nothing like me.

03:48.875 --> 03:51.250
<c.speaker>He's smarter,
better looking.

03:51.250 --> 03:53.458
<c.speaker>He's better than me
at everything.

03:53.458 --> 03:55.250
<c.speaker>This would
not be too difficult.

03:55.250 --> 03:56.625
<c.speaker>Esteban, please.

03:56.625 --> 03:59.958
<c.speaker>Santos says I destroy
everything I get my hands on.

03:59.958 --> 04:03.375
<c.speaker>He calls it
the Armando Touch.

04:03.375 --> 04:05.333
<c.speaker>But you run
the palace so well.

04:05.333 --> 04:07.833
<c.speaker>I didn't do things so well
when I was growing up.

04:07.833 --> 04:10.250
<c.speaker>I did everything wrong.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.458
<c.speaker>-What? I don't believe it.
-It's true.

04:12.458 --> 04:16.083
<c.speaker>It all began my first day
helping on the family farm.

04:16.083 --> 04:19.166
<c.speaker>My mamá told me to milk
the cow and water the crops.

04:19.166 --> 04:22.625
<c.speaker>But I ended up watering
the cow and milking the, uh...

04:22.625 --> 04:24.583
<c.speaker>Well, you know.

04:24.583 --> 04:27.500
<c.speaker>-Ooh.
-Beginner's mistake?

04:27.500 --> 04:29.875
<c.speaker>Oh, Santos never let me
forget about it.

04:29.875 --> 04:32.083
<c.speaker>Every time
I did something, he'd say,

04:32.083 --> 04:34.458
<c.speaker>"Watch out
for the Armando Touch."

04:34.458 --> 04:37.708
<c.speaker>And sure enough,
I'd mess it up.

04:37.708 --> 04:40.625
<c.speaker>Well, that does not sound
like the Armando we know.

04:40.625 --> 04:44.500
<c.speaker>And I know exactly
how to show Santos
just how far you've come.

04:44.500 --> 04:45.958
<c.speaker>How?

04:45.958 --> 04:47.458
<c.speaker>By putting you
in charge of the Fair!

<c.speaker>Oh! [chuckles]

<c.speaker>Huh?

07:08.708 --> 07:10.750
<c.speaker>[man]
Looking good,

07:10.750 --> 07:12.625
<c.speaker>Ow! Santos?

07:12.625 --> 07:15.458
<c.speaker>[chuckles] They got you
on garbage duty, huh?

07:15.458 --> 07:18.458
<c.speaker>Santos! Don't pick
on your little brother.

07:18.458 --> 07:21.083
<c.speaker>Garbage duty
is honest work.

07:21.083 --> 07:22.583
<c.speaker>But, Mamá--

07:22.583 --> 07:24.833
<c.speaker>What'd you do wrong
this time, <i>hermanito? </i>

<c.speaker>-Ha ha!
-No noogies!

<c.speaker>I'm Crown Princess Elena.

<c.speaker>Yes, I've heard
so much about you.

07:41.708 --> 07:44.458
<c.speaker>You must be
so proud of Armando.

07:44.458 --> 07:45.708
<c.speaker>He's my Chief of the Castle

07:45.708 --> 07:48.375
<c.speaker><i>and </i>master of this fair.

07:48.375 --> 07:50.375
<c.speaker>He is?! But how?

07:50.375 --> 07:53.750
<c.speaker>The Armando I know destroys
everything he touches.

07:53.750 --> 07:55.583
<c.speaker>Don't talk about
your brother like that!

07:55.583 --> 07:58.000
<c.speaker>He can't help
the way he is.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.333
<c.speaker>I'm not that way anymore.

08:00.333 --> 08:02.750
<c.speaker>Whoaa! Ohh! [groans]

08:02.750 --> 08:05.125

08:05.125 --> 08:09.458

Come one, come all,

08:12.708 --> 08:14.750
<c.speaker>to the emporium tonight.

08:14.750 --> 08:19.625
<c.speaker>Come celebrate
Doña Paloma's glorious victory.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.333
<c.speaker>Yes,
and while you're there,

08:21.333 --> 08:25.333
<c.speaker>take advantage of my
glorious victory deals.

08:25.333 --> 08:27.250
<c.speaker>Hello, neighbor.
Doña Paloma.

08:27.250 --> 08:28.875
<c.speaker>Doña, it's me-- Julio.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.416
<c.speaker>Uh, Julio Guzman?

08:32.458 --> 08:33.833
<c.speaker>This is my sister Carmen?

08:33.833 --> 08:36.708
<c.speaker>Last <i>Navidad, </i>you helped
us build our float?

08:36.708 --> 08:39.416
<c.speaker>We sang a song together?

08:39.416 --> 08:41.708
<c.speaker>Of course we did.

08:41.708 --> 08:44.583
<c.speaker>So pleased to meet you,
um, again.

08:44.583 --> 08:46.750
<c.speaker>Great!
So as Magister of Trade,

08:46.750 --> 08:49.708
<c.speaker>what are your plans
to spruce up
the Via Mercado?

08:49.708 --> 08:51.500
<c.speaker>Spruce it up? Pff.

08:51.500 --> 08:52.708
<c.speaker>That would cost money.

08:52.708 --> 08:54.708
<c.speaker>It's fine just the way it is.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.166
<c.speaker>But I was thinking,
if we--

08:56.166 --> 08:58.958
<c.speaker>Why don't you keep doing...
whatever it is you do

08:58.958 --> 09:01.625
<c.speaker>and leave
the thinking to me, hmm?

09:01.625 --> 09:03.750
<c.speaker>Hope to see you both
at my party.

09:03.750 --> 09:06.750
<c.speaker>[chuckles]
She is a charmer,
that one, hmm?

09:06.750 --> 09:10.875
<c.speaker>[scoffs] She didn't listen
to a word Julio said!

09:10.875 --> 09:12.458
<c.speaker>Well, she does not have to.

09:12.458 --> 09:15.333
<c.speaker>She has been
Magister of Trade
for 12 years,

09:15.333 --> 09:17.875
<c.speaker>and no one ever runs
against her.

09:17.875 --> 09:19.875
<c.speaker>Well, maybe someone should.

09:19.875 --> 09:22.416
<c.speaker>And maybe that
"someone" is me!

09:22.416 --> 09:25.083
<c.speaker>I'm going to run
for Magister of Trade.

09:26.208 --> 09:27.416
<c.speaker>Armando!

09:27.416 --> 09:28.583
<c.speaker>What a crowd!

09:28.583 --> 09:30.208
<c.speaker>You've really
outdone yourself.

09:30.208 --> 09:33.875
<c.speaker>Thanks! And who can resist
your famous <i>picarones? </i>

09:33.875 --> 09:36.625
<c.speaker>Once they try one,
they just have to buy more.

09:36.625 --> 09:37.750
<c.speaker>Free sample?

09:37.750 --> 09:40.083
<c.speaker>Ooh! I am
feeling a bit peckish.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.958
<c.speaker>[humming]

09:43.958 --> 09:45.875
<c.speaker>The booth looks nice, mamá.

09:45.875 --> 09:48.208
<c.speaker>Yes, it's beautiful.
[laughs]

09:48.208 --> 09:52.416
<c.speaker>It's just a shame
there are no customers
here to see it.

09:52.416 --> 09:55.125
<c.speaker>Y'know, I've been
all over the fair,

09:55.125 --> 09:57.083
<c.speaker>and the other merchants
do things

09:57.083 --> 09:58.458
<c.speaker>to draw in new customers.

09:58.458 --> 09:59.958
<c.speaker>Like offering free samples.

09:59.958 --> 10:02.291
<c.speaker>Pssh! Free samples?

10:02.291 --> 10:05.166
<c.speaker>"Free" draws crowds.
And crowds are what we need.

10:05.166 --> 10:08.875
<c.speaker>So you want me
to just give away
Queso Gutierrez.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.625
<c.speaker>What
an excellent idea...

10:11.625 --> 10:13.833
<c.speaker>for how to ruin
a business!

10:13.833 --> 10:15.875
<c.speaker>B-But once the crowds come--

10:15.875 --> 10:19.833
<c.speaker>Then we can lose money
even faster! Brilliant!

10:19.833 --> 10:22.875
<c.speaker>Maybe you should go back
to garbage duty

10:22.875 --> 10:24.750
<c.speaker>and leave the selling to me.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.291
<c.speaker>[groans]
It wasn't garbage duty!

10:28.625 --> 10:29.708
<c.speaker>[creak]

10:31.833 --> 10:34.958
<c.speaker>And there it is:
The Armando Touch.

10:34.958 --> 10:36.708
<c.speaker>[giggles]

10:38.458 --> 10:40.833
<c.speaker>Whoo. His brother's
really got him rattled.

10:40.833 --> 10:43.000
<c.speaker>What happened
to our glitch fixer?

10:43.000 --> 10:46.750
<c.speaker>Do you see any flowers
in the shadow
of that ceiba tree?

10:46.750 --> 10:48.708
<c.speaker>-No.
-Well, that's because

10:48.708 --> 10:51.000
<c.speaker>the big tree is
hogging all the light.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.083
<c.speaker>Armando couldn't
blossom until he got out
of his brother's shadow.

10:55.083 --> 10:58.750
<c.speaker>So if we can figure out
how to get Santos away...

10:58.750 --> 11:01.000
<c.speaker>We'll have
our real Armando back.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.291
<c.speaker>D-D-Don't touch that!

11:02.291 --> 11:04.166
<c.speaker>Oh! Sorry.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.000
<c.speaker>-Come on, cow.

11:16.583 --> 11:17.875
<c.speaker>What did you do
with Bonita?

11:17.875 --> 11:19.500
<c.speaker>I didn't do anything.

11:19.500 --> 11:20.958
<c.speaker>But I'll find her.

11:20.958 --> 11:22.291
<c.speaker>No! <i>I'll </i>find her.

11:22.291 --> 11:25.625

Don't touch anything!

11:25.625 --> 11:27.000

<c.speaker>It's time for a change.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.125
<c.speaker>Julio listens to us.
He--

12:34.125 --> 12:36.208
<c.speaker>I am an excellent
listener.

12:36.208 --> 12:39.000

-I am the greatest
listener ever!

<c.speaker>If you'd stop
interrupting,

12:40.458 --> 12:42.458
<c.speaker>you'd hear what

12:42.458 --> 12:45.500
<c.speaker>Julio not only listens,
he cares what everyone thinks.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.958

<c.speaker>I do.

13:11.208 --> 13:13.750

on your brother.

<c.speaker>Could I borrow Santos
for a minute?

<c.speaker>Only if you promise
to return him.

13:26.291 --> 13:27.958

13:27.958 --> 13:30.125
<c.speaker>I want to talk
to you about Armando.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.750
<c.speaker>He's not the bumbling brother
you once knew.

13:32.750 --> 13:35.083
<c.speaker>Princesa,
I mean no disrespect,

13:35.083 --> 13:36.958
<c.speaker>but it's
the Armando Touch.

13:36.958 --> 13:40.208
<c.speaker>Everything he touches,
he destroys.

13:40.208 --> 13:42.458
<c.speaker>Well, maybe if you didn't
put him down so much,

13:42.458 --> 13:43.958
<c.speaker>he wouldn't get so rattled.

13:43.958 --> 13:46.000
<c.speaker>It is simply the truth.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.083
<c.speaker>Our dairy farm is
a failure because of him.

13:49.083 --> 13:51.416
<c.speaker>Cheese curdled
in his hands.

13:51.416 --> 13:55.000
<c.speaker>Cows kicked over
their buckets when
he tried to milk them.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.750
<c.speaker>He once tried
to build a tree swing,

13:56.750 --> 13:58.250
<c.speaker>but it was so lopsided,

13:58.250 --> 14:00.458
<c.speaker>I had to rescue him
before he fell out of it!

14:00.458 --> 14:01.875
<c.speaker>Heed my warning.

14:01.875 --> 14:05.208
<c.speaker>He is a disaster
waiting to happen.

going to stay?

we can find something--

14:57.708 --> 14:59.000
<c.speaker>We want answers now!

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
<c.speaker>-Armando, fix this!
-Our trip is ruined.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.833
<c.speaker>Hey! Everyone
take one step back!

15:03.833 --> 15:06.416
<c.speaker>You leave
my kid brother alone.

15:06.416 --> 15:09.083
<c.speaker>Can't you see he has
no clue what he's doing?

15:09.083 --> 15:10.416
<c.speaker>[sighs] Ay.

15:10.416 --> 15:12.166
<c.speaker>Well, no that you
mention it.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.708
<c.speaker>Mamá?

15:13.708 --> 15:17.208
<c.speaker>Ay, maybe it's best
that you just come home.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.958
<c.speaker>[sighs]
Okay, Mamá.

15:22.333 --> 15:24.416
<c.speaker>I might
as well go home, too.

15:24.416 --> 15:26.416
<c.speaker>There's no way
we'll sell anything now.

15:26.416 --> 15:29.291
<c.speaker>-Armando! Wait!
-Princess,
you've go to help us.

15:29.291 --> 15:30.500
<c.speaker>-Where are we gonna
stay tonight?
-Princess Elena!

15:30.500 --> 15:32.125
<c.speaker>What are you going
to do about this?

15:32.125 --> 15:34.083

<c.speaker>We're in trouble,

15:58.083 --> 15:59.708
<c.speaker>We need you back.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.833
<c.speaker>Oh, Santos is right about me.

16:01.833 --> 16:03.208
<c.speaker>That's why I left.

16:03.208 --> 16:06.125
<c.speaker>I wreck everything I touch.

16:06.125 --> 16:08.291
<c.speaker>I can't even build

16:12.125 --> 16:13.625
<c.speaker>See?

16:13.625 --> 16:15.833

when you built it?

16:15.833 --> 16:17.625
<c.speaker>More like pointing
and laughing.

16:17.625 --> 16:19.708
<c.speaker>Well, let me tell you
what you've done

16:19.708 --> 16:21.625
<c.speaker>when Santos
wasn't watching.

16:21.625 --> 16:23.708
<c.speaker>You helped me
drive out Shuriki

16:23.708 --> 16:26.208
<c.speaker>and stop
Victor and Carla.

16:26.208 --> 16:29.083
<c.speaker>You created the schedule
the whole castle runs on.

16:29.083 --> 16:31.583
<c.speaker>I also created
a wild animal stampede.

16:31.583 --> 16:34.000
<c.speaker>You mean
the bunnies and piglets?

16:34.000 --> 16:36.583
<c.speaker>It only happened because Santos
was putting you down

16:36.583 --> 16:38.208
<c.speaker>and you got upset.

16:38.208 --> 16:42.250
<c.speaker>Whenever he's around,
you forget who you really are.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.125
<c.speaker>But I know
the real Armando.

16:45.333 --> 16:46.416
<c.speaker>Thanks, Princess.

16:46.416 --> 16:48.375
<c.speaker>I'm going back.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.166
<c.speaker>You're going back?!

16:50.166 --> 16:53.208
<c.speaker>Yes. Yes, I am.

16:53.208 --> 16:55.208
<c.speaker>Fine. Go.

16:55.208 --> 16:57.625
<c.speaker>At least you won't be around
to wreck the farm again.

16:57.625 --> 17:00.708
<c.speaker>You know, maybe
I would have done just fine

17:00.708 --> 17:03.958
<c.speaker>if you weren't always
saying I was a disaster.

17:03.958 --> 17:05.000
<c.speaker>[scoffs]

17:05.000 --> 17:06.333
<c.speaker>Go ahead and scoff,

17:06.333 --> 17:08.333
<c.speaker>but I run
the Palace of Avalor.

17:08.333 --> 17:10.375
<c.speaker>I'm the royal Glitch Fixer.

17:10.375 --> 17:12.375
<c.speaker>And maybe if you'd
listened to me,

17:12.375 --> 17:16.125
<c.speaker>you would have sold some cheese
at the All Kingdoms Fair!

17:16.125 --> 17:18.875
<c.speaker>Are you gonna let him
speak to me like that?!

17:21.208 --> 17:24.166
<c.speaker>I thought I'd always need
to look out for you, <i>mijo. </i>

17:24.166 --> 17:27.000
<c.speaker>But all you really needed
was the chance

17:27.000 --> 17:29.458
<c.speaker>to become your own man.

17:29.458 --> 17:31.333
<c.speaker>A great man.

17:33.333 --> 17:34.375
<c.speaker>Bah!

17:36.083 --> 17:39.583
<c.speaker>C'mon, Princess.
We've got a fair to save.

17:39.583 --> 17:42.083
<c.speaker>Oh, good!
You're back!

17:42.083 --> 17:43.500
<c.speaker>I don't know
what to do with these.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.875
<c.speaker>Uh, Armando? Any ideas?

17:46.875 --> 17:49.750
<c.speaker>Ugh! I am so exhausted,

17:49.750 --> 17:52.000
<c.speaker>I could fall asleep
right here.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.458
<c.speaker>I got it!

17:53.458 --> 17:55.166
<c.speaker>I know where to house
everyone for the night.

17:55.166 --> 17:57.583
<c.speaker>-You do?
-Right here.

17:57.583 --> 18:00.500
<c.speaker>We're going
to have a sleepover
in Castillo Park.

18:02.250 --> 18:03.833
<c.speaker>Okay. It's worth a try.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.208
<c.speaker>Right, Naomi?

18:05.208 --> 18:08.458
<c.speaker>-[pigs snoring]
-[Naomi sighs]

18:08.458 --> 18:11.166
<c.speaker>Let's go, people!
Let's make this happen!

18:11.166 --> 18:14.375
<c.speaker>Everyone gather around
for the highlight of the fair,

18:14.375 --> 18:17.166
<c.speaker>the "Starlight Sleepover!"

18:17.166 --> 18:19.625
<c.speaker>[music playing]

18:26.291 --> 18:28.708
<c.speaker>[snoring]

18:31.166 --> 18:33.208
<c.speaker>Nice work, Armando.

18:33.208 --> 18:34.416
<c.speaker>Thanks, Princess.

18:35.500 --> 18:38.250
<c.speaker>And another vote
for Julio.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.333
<c.speaker>Well, the people
have spoken.

18:40.333 --> 18:44.333
<c.speaker>And the new Magister of Trade
is Julio Guzman!

18:44.333 --> 18:45.333
<c.speaker>[applause]

18:45.333 --> 18:46.500
<c.speaker>I won?

18:46.500 --> 18:47.750
<c.speaker>I won!

18:47.750 --> 18:49.375
<c.speaker>-[cheering]
-Viva Guzman!

18:49.375 --> 18:51.458
<c.speaker>I demand a recount!

18:51.458 --> 18:52.750
<c.speaker>This <i>is </i>the recount.

18:54.458 --> 18:57.000
<c.speaker>Martín!
Is this your handwriting?!

18:57.000 --> 18:58.416
<c.speaker>-[angry growl]
-Congratulations, Julio!

18:58.416 --> 19:00.208
<c.speaker>Thank you.

19:00.208 --> 19:03.333
<c.speaker>Okay, so the first thing
you need to do is
fix these potholes.

19:03.333 --> 19:05.291
<c.speaker>-Potholes, yes.
-Potholes? No, no.

19:05.291 --> 19:08.000
<c.speaker>-The sidewalks
should come first.
-Sidewalks, of course.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.833
<c.speaker>-No, no, no,
a bigger fountain!
-[Julio] Bigger!

19:09.833 --> 19:11.125
<c.speaker>-No, the sidewalks!
-A smaller fountain!

19:11.125 --> 19:12.583
<c.speaker>Smaller, yes.

19:12.583 --> 19:13.625
<c.speaker>[woman]
I want more flowers!

19:13.625 --> 19:15.291
<c.speaker>One at a time,
please!

19:15.291 --> 19:16.458
<c.speaker>-Longer lunch breaks!
-More festivals!

19:16.458 --> 19:18.083
<c.speaker>-Expand the port!
-More holidays!

19:19.583 --> 19:22.375
<c.speaker>Perhaps you should
seek help from someone

19:22.375 --> 19:24.583
<c.speaker>with experience
in these matters.

19:29.333 --> 19:30.708
<c.speaker>Doña?

19:30.708 --> 19:32.625
<c.speaker>Hmm. Come to gloat?

19:32.625 --> 19:34.125
<c.speaker>I can't blame you.

19:34.125 --> 19:36.125
<c.speaker>It's glorious, isn't it,

19:36.125 --> 19:40.125
<c.speaker>the feeling
of sheer power rippling
through your being?

19:40.125 --> 19:43.458
<c.speaker>I... guess so.

19:43.458 --> 19:46.875
<c.speaker>People sure do
have a lot of opinions
about how to run things.

19:46.875 --> 19:48.583
<c.speaker>Ugh! So true.

19:48.583 --> 19:51.583
<c.speaker>But it's not
the same as actually
running them, is it?

19:51.583 --> 19:53.875
<c.speaker>Exactly.
They're all important.

19:53.875 --> 19:56.875
<c.speaker>So what do I do first?
How do I prioritize?

19:56.875 --> 20:01.125
<c.speaker>I guess what I'm saying is
I'd really like you to...

20:01.125 --> 20:02.833
<c.speaker>Take over as Magister?!

20:02.833 --> 20:05.375
<c.speaker>-Be my assistant?
-Assistant Magister?

20:05.375 --> 20:06.750
<c.speaker>Uh, no, not really, no.

20:06.750 --> 20:10.583
<c.speaker>Assistant <i>to </i>the Magister.

20:10.583 --> 20:12.583
<c.speaker>Oh! Fine.

20:12.583 --> 20:16.416
<c.speaker>With my experience
and your... whatever
it is you bring,

20:16.416 --> 20:19.625
<c.speaker>the Avalor Trade Guild
will be stronger than ever.

20:19.625 --> 20:21.416
<c.speaker>I look forward
to working with you.

20:23.583 --> 20:27.625
<c.speaker>And when you fail miserably,
I'll be ready to take over.

20:27.625 --> 20:30.750
<c.speaker>Assistant
to the Magister, hmm?

20:30.750 --> 20:34.375
<c.speaker>I did not think you would
look so pleased by his request.

20:34.375 --> 20:36.583
<c.speaker>Having to play
second fiddle
to that amateur?

20:36.583 --> 20:38.083
<c.speaker>It's humiliating.

20:38.083 --> 20:41.000
<c.speaker>This is true.
This is why I suggested it.

20:44.583 --> 20:45.833
<c.speaker>Free sample!

20:45.833 --> 20:48.458
<c.speaker>Free sample! Free sample here!

20:48.458 --> 20:52.000
<c.speaker>Queso Gutierrez,
the finest cheese in Avalor.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.208
<c.speaker>Thank you!

20:53.208 --> 20:55.208
<c.speaker>Last night
was so much fun!

20:55.208 --> 20:56.708
<c.speaker>The sleepover was great!

20:56.708 --> 20:58.458
<c.speaker>Thank you, Armando!

20:58.458 --> 21:02.583
<c.speaker>Uh-oh. Big glitch
coming this way.

21:06.458 --> 21:08.083
<c.speaker>Free sample?

21:08.083 --> 21:12.083
<c.speaker>I cannot believe you are giving
away our cheese for free.

21:12.083 --> 21:14.000
<c.speaker>Once they try it,
they can't resist.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.250
<c.speaker>They want to buy more.

21:15.250 --> 21:17.458
<c.speaker>Ridiculous.

21:17.458 --> 21:20.375
<c.speaker>No, <i>mijo. </i>Look!
We're almost sold out!

21:23.416 --> 21:25.500
<c.speaker>You sold all this?

21:25.500 --> 21:29.458
<c.speaker>Just by giving away
free samples?

21:29.458 --> 21:30.500
<c.speaker>-Ahh!
-No noogies!

21:30.500 --> 21:32.125
<c.speaker>[grunts]

21:32.125 --> 21:33.166
<c.speaker><i>Gracias, hermano. </i>

21:34.583 --> 21:37.958
<c.speaker>I've been hard on you
your whole life.

21:37.958 --> 21:42.208
<c.speaker>And for that,
I am truly sorry.

21:42.208 --> 21:44.333
<c.speaker>This is my brother,
everyone!

21:44.333 --> 21:47.375
<c.speaker>Armando--
Chief of the Castle,

21:47.375 --> 21:50.250
<c.speaker>Master of Ceremonies,

21:50.250 --> 21:52.875
<c.speaker>and the world's
greatest cheese seller.

21:52.875 --> 21:55.333
<c.speaker>Thank you, Santos.

21:55.333 --> 21:56.375
<c.speaker>Mmm!

22:03.625 --> 22:06.416
<c.speaker>[theme music playing]
