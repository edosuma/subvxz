WEBVTT

00:02.089 --> 00:03.003
Malika.

00:08.965 --> 00:10.184
What would you do
if I came back?

00:10.923 --> 00:11.707
I don't know.

00:13.491 --> 00:15.972
Alice: <i>I just think</i> <i>
maybe we're better off</i> <i>
as friends.</i>

00:16.016 --> 00:18.061
Sure. Good night.

00:19.106 --> 00:19.889
Good night.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.676
Dennis: <i>Are you scared</i> <i>
of what we could be?</i>

00:24.720 --> 00:25.851
Are you using me?

00:27.244 --> 00:28.680
I've come to a decision.

00:30.030 --> 00:30.987
I know what I want.

00:32.162 --> 00:35.470
Why not be with Isabella,
be a family?

00:35.513 --> 00:37.211
I'm gonna be a father.

00:37.254 --> 00:39.343
And I don't know
how to do that part-time.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.693
Please stay.

00:43.173 --> 00:45.045
Would you ever give us
another chance?

00:46.220 --> 00:47.612
all:
Would you?

00:48.178 --> 00:49.658
Jackie: <i>
What did she say?</i>

00:50.528 --> 00:51.834
She hasn't responded yet.

00:53.270 --> 00:56.360
Judge Wilson:
So, Callie Adams Foster,

00:56.404 --> 00:58.014
why did you wanna become
an attorney?

00:58.058 --> 01:01.104
I wanted to fight
for social and civil rights.

01:01.148 --> 01:02.584
When're you gonna stop
making excuses

01:02.627 --> 01:03.802
for why you keep
getting derailed?

01:03.846 --> 01:04.977
I'm not making excuses.

01:05.021 --> 01:07.937
Do you think
it was wise to trust me?

01:07.980 --> 01:09.373
Do you believe I'm innocent?

01:09.417 --> 01:10.940
You're stuck
in a loop, Callie,

01:10.983 --> 01:13.508
playing out the same scenes
day after day.

01:13.986 --> 01:16.032
Is that...
why you're leaving?

01:17.860 --> 01:19.035
I'm leaving?

01:21.342 --> 01:22.821
What's keeping you here?

01:38.576 --> 01:42.189

<i>- are on my desk.</i>
- Got 'em.

03:05.663 --> 03:07.622
<i>- And weed out</i> <i>any friends of Kelly's.</i>
- Clearly.

03:07.665 --> 03:09.232
<i>Maybe you should dial me</i> <i>
into the interviews.</i>

03:09.276 --> 03:11.016
Okay, you put me in charge.

03:11.060 --> 03:14.106
You need to just let go
and concentrate on your act.

03:14.150 --> 03:15.369
How are you feeling?

03:15.412 --> 03:17.588
<i>I don't know.</i> <i>
It all happened so fast.</i>

03:17.632 --> 03:20.025
<i>I mean, I can't believe</i> <i>

03:20.983 --> 03:23.246
<i>The only bad thing is that</i> <i>

03:23.290 --> 03:26.206

Not complaining, though.</i>

03:33.169 --> 03:34.692
<i>A dream well deserved.</i>

03:34.736 --> 03:35.737
Enjoy it.

03:35.780 --> 03:36.955
And don't worry
about the Coterie.

03:36.999 --> 03:38.566
I have everything
under control.

03:38.609 --> 03:40.132

03:40.176 --> 03:41.873

I just burned my bagel.

03:55.147 --> 03:56.366
Talk about overkill.

03:56.410 --> 03:58.368
This place is not burning down
on my watch.

03:58.934 --> 04:00.805
Kelly: Yet another reason
why I should've been chosen

04:00.849 --> 04:01.893
as interim manager.

04:01.937 --> 04:04.156
I have experience
with small fires,

04:04.200 --> 04:05.288
many of which
I have started.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.116
We needed
a new toaster anyway,

04:07.159 --> 04:08.770
and I'm thinking about
replacing that stove.

04:08.813 --> 04:09.901
With what money?

04:09.945 --> 04:11.076
I'm raising the rent
on the new loft.

04:13.165 --> 04:17.257
I appreciate
you wanting me to stay.

04:18.606 --> 04:20.956
But I have a job

04:20.999 --> 04:23.959
and a free place
to live in Santa Barbara
and...

04:25.569 --> 04:28.180
I don't feel right
living here anymore.

04:29.225 --> 04:31.662
I can't keep putting you
out of your loft like this.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.055
It just--

04:34.926 --> 04:36.319
It makes sense that I go.

04:39.496 --> 04:40.280
How much?

04:41.150 --> 04:42.412
1850?

04:42.456 --> 04:43.587
I'll take it.

04:44.196 --> 04:45.937
Uh, well,
you'll need to apply.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.199
And why do you need
two lofts?

04:47.243 --> 04:48.505
Uh, it's for Isabella.

04:48.549 --> 04:50.159
Oh, well, then,
she'll need to apply.

04:50.202 --> 04:51.247
I'll be paying for it.

04:51.987 --> 04:53.815
Sumi: Well,
if your credit checks out,

04:53.858 --> 04:55.425
I'm gonna need
first, last month's

04:55.469 --> 04:57.340
and a full month's deposit
before end of day.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.908
I have a lot
of promising applicants.

04:59.951 --> 05:01.213
I'm sorry.

05:01.257 --> 05:02.432
Okay,
who's cleaning this up?

05:02.476 --> 05:03.868
- Hello?
- Not me.

05:04.347 --> 05:05.696
woman:
Hi. Malika Williams?

05:06.480 --> 05:08.525
- I'm Malika.
- These are for you.

05:09.396 --> 05:10.527
Thanks.

05:12.094 --> 05:15.315
Ooh, I wonder who
those are from.

05:22.670 --> 05:23.845
What're you doing here?

05:25.020 --> 05:26.151
I hate my life without you.

05:27.152 --> 05:29.851
I-- I-- I love you
and I want to be with you.

05:29.894 --> 05:31.635
Just us,
like it was before.

05:33.724 --> 05:35.857
I'm-- I mean,
if the offer still stands.

05:37.728 --> 05:38.512
I...

05:39.251 --> 05:41.166
can't do this
right now.

05:42.603 --> 05:44.866
I'm starting a new job
in the morning and...

05:46.998 --> 05:48.217
I need time to think.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.741
Um, yeah, it's okay,
I get it.

05:55.137 --> 05:57.226
Dyonte: <i>Malika,</i> <i>
have a great first day.</i>

05:58.140 --> 05:59.750
<i>Slash through that red tape.</i>

05:59.794 --> 06:01.230
<i>Love, Dyonte.</i>

06:07.715 --> 06:08.846
They're just from Dyonte,

06:10.370 --> 06:12.284
wishing me good luck
on my first day
at my new job.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.167
Well, I should get going.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.695
- Don't.
- I did not!

06:33.262 --> 06:37.353
But do you have $5,550?

06:37.397 --> 06:38.398
No, I don't,

06:38.441 --> 06:40.225
but I need
Isabella to stay.

06:41.226 --> 06:43.533
And I can always ask Yuri
for an advance

06:43.577 --> 06:45.405
on my next commission.
It's not a big deal.

06:45.448 --> 06:46.710
Well, it's all a big deal.

06:47.319 --> 06:48.843
You're gonna be a father.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.238
I heard you made a choice.

06:53.848 --> 06:54.631
I did!

06:55.763 --> 06:57.373
And are you happy?

06:57.417 --> 06:58.722
I am.

06:58.766 --> 07:00.202
But I have to go to work,

07:00.245 --> 07:02.073
so I'll have to fill you in
on the details later.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.036
Has the jury
come to a verdict?

07:08.950 --> 07:09.777
Yes, Your Honor.

07:21.919 --> 07:22.746
Please rise.

07:23.617 --> 07:24.531
Face the jury.

07:33.278 --> 07:34.323
You may proceed.

07:36.194 --> 07:37.413
juror: In the matter of <i>
The People of the State</i> <i>
of California</i>

07:37.457 --> 07:38.936
<i>versus Thomas Sung,</i>

07:38.980 --> 07:41.112
for the charge of murder
in the first degree...

07:42.462 --> 07:44.246
we find the defendant...

07:47.467 --> 07:48.642
not guilty.

08:13.405 --> 08:14.494
Congratulations.

08:15.451 --> 08:16.365
How do you feel?

08:16.408 --> 08:17.975
Uh, pretty good.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.371
Do you think
he got away with murder?

08:23.067 --> 08:24.416
I think there's more
to the story.

08:24.460 --> 08:25.766
Why?

08:25.809 --> 08:27.985
There was a moment
in the trial,

08:28.029 --> 08:29.944
Kathleen said something
to the jury,

08:29.987 --> 08:31.685
they looked at Tommy
and he welled up,

08:32.686 --> 08:33.556
like he was coached.

08:34.862 --> 08:37.517
And I don't trust anyone
who can cry on cue.

08:38.343 --> 08:39.562
Then you'll never trust
my sister.

08:42.217 --> 08:43.348
Incoming.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.395
Where's Kathleen Gale?

08:46.438 --> 08:48.223
Uh, should be around here
somewhere.

08:48.266 --> 08:49.485
She appears
to have slipped out.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.400
Any idea where
she might've gone?

08:51.879 --> 08:53.010
Maybe back to the office?

08:53.054 --> 08:54.272
We're not playing games.

08:54.316 --> 08:55.796
And you have 24 hours

08:55.839 --> 08:58.146
to make your client
available to us
for questioning

08:58.189 --> 09:00.235
before we issue a warrant
for her arrest.

09:01.497 --> 09:03.455
And yours...
for obstruction.

09:18.688 --> 09:19.820
Journaling?

09:20.690 --> 09:23.475
Uh, no,
not a journaler.

09:24.476 --> 09:26.217
I'm not into writing down
my feelings.

09:26.827 --> 09:28.611
It's weird.
What about you?

09:29.133 --> 09:31.135
The same, actually.

09:32.615 --> 09:34.486
But I am keeping
a pregnancy journal

09:34.530 --> 09:35.444
for the baby.

09:35.487 --> 09:37.533
- That's a nice idea.
- Yeah.

09:37.838 --> 09:39.753
Gael's mom gave it to me

09:39.796 --> 09:43.321
just to kind of... like,
keep track of the firsts.

09:43.365 --> 09:45.323
You know, like
the first ultrasound

09:45.367 --> 09:47.325
and the first time
the baby moves...

09:47.369 --> 09:48.588
And kicks.

09:49.023 --> 09:49.980
And the fruit sizes.

09:50.024 --> 09:51.416
Yes!

09:51.678 --> 09:53.157
What size is the baby now?

09:53.810 --> 09:55.507
Um, a lemon.

09:55.899 --> 09:57.727
Hmm, a lemon.

09:59.947 --> 10:01.644
You're growing a person.

10:02.384 --> 10:03.864
That is so crazy.

10:05.822 --> 10:07.519
Uh, so what
were you working on?

10:07.563 --> 10:10.784
Earlier, you looked
very, very serious.

10:10.827 --> 10:14.744
So I am having a soft opening
of my food truck tomorrow night.

10:14.788 --> 10:16.572
- I hope you'll come.
- Of course.

10:17.355 --> 10:20.837
And I'm trying
to figure out
the food costs.

10:20.881 --> 10:23.361
Don't tell anybody,
but I might not have
any idea

10:23.405 --> 10:24.493
what the hell I'm doing.

10:25.537 --> 10:26.843
Well, I've worked
in restaurants

10:26.887 --> 10:28.802
since I was, like, 15.

10:28.845 --> 10:29.890
Do you want me
to take a look?

10:29.933 --> 10:30.717
Please.

10:32.893 --> 10:35.547
Okay, so without
a beer and wine license,

10:35.591 --> 10:37.767
that means you need
all your profit
to come from food,

10:37.811 --> 10:39.682
which means
you can't afford any waste.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.989
Right. So your menu needs
some shared ingredients.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.688
Okay, for example,
you're only using the burrata

10:45.732 --> 10:48.082
for the burrata
and tomato toast, right?

10:48.125 --> 10:49.692
But what if you use it
as an add on

10:49.736 --> 10:51.955
for your
crispy pancetta points,

10:51.999 --> 10:53.696
and the pizza pie toast?

10:59.920 --> 11:01.138
Make yourself at home.

11:02.270 --> 11:04.402
Oh, I had
to take my heels off

11:04.446 --> 11:07.841
and the floor looked,
well, like that,

11:07.884 --> 11:09.581
so I figured
you wouldn't mind.

11:09.625 --> 11:12.149
Well, considering
those are Mariana's,
I don't.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.196
So what did
Tweedledee and Dumb

11:15.239 --> 11:17.111
think of
my disappearing act?

11:17.154 --> 11:18.329
Oh, not amused.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.202
So did you talk
to Ken Sung?

11:21.245 --> 11:22.725
No.

11:22.769 --> 11:23.944
Why not?

11:24.640 --> 11:26.033
I mean,
you made good on your end.

11:26.076 --> 11:27.948
You got Tommy acquitted.
All we need from him

11:27.991 --> 11:29.427
is proof
that his sister's alive

11:29.471 --> 11:31.038
and-- and the FBI
gets off your back.

11:32.082 --> 11:34.824
Except things
are a little more
complicated now.

11:36.870 --> 11:37.827
Why?

11:39.829 --> 11:42.745
I took money
from Albert Chen's retainer,

11:42.789 --> 11:44.225
and I gave it to Denise

11:44.268 --> 11:46.357
to help her disappear
and get a new identity.

11:47.619 --> 11:50.797
And "sack of shit" Sackolov
from my old firm

11:50.840 --> 11:52.494
gave my books to the FBI.

11:53.451 --> 11:55.149
So in order
to keep me out of jail,

11:55.192 --> 11:57.717
we are going to need
more than proof of life.

11:57.934 --> 12:01.764
We need Denise to give the FBI
something that they can use

12:01.808 --> 12:04.114
to help put her husband away.

12:04.158 --> 12:06.769
And we need Ken
to convince her to do that.

12:07.509 --> 12:10.381
And by "we," I mean you,

12:10.425 --> 12:13.558
because, obviously,
I can't show my face right now.

12:13.602 --> 12:14.864
You promised me you wouldn't
lie to me again.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.736
I didn't lie.

12:18.172 --> 12:19.826
I omitted facts that,
until now,
were not relevant.

12:19.869 --> 12:22.002
Don't try
to litigate this with me.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.875
I'm sorry.

12:28.182 --> 12:29.183
You're right.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.969
To be honest,
I didn't tell you the truth

12:33.013 --> 12:34.014
because I...

12:35.102 --> 12:37.147
did something illegal
and stupid,

12:37.191 --> 12:39.802
and I didn't want you
to lose respect for me.

12:41.804 --> 12:44.111
If the FBI gives my books
to the DA,

12:44.154 --> 12:47.897
Rothman will make sure
that I go to prison.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.164
I'm scared.

12:57.341 --> 12:58.212
And I need you.

Hi.

It's good to see you.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.571
It's good
to see you too.

13:55.443 --> 13:56.226
- How are you?
- What's new?

13:56.270 --> 13:58.489
Oh, sorry. You first.

13:59.751 --> 14:01.101
All right.

14:02.189 --> 14:03.799
I adopted a pet turtle.

14:06.584 --> 14:08.717
Well, turtles are often marketed
as low-maintenance pets,

14:08.760 --> 14:10.719
but the truth is
they need special care

14:10.762 --> 14:12.373
and a lot of room to grow.

14:13.548 --> 14:14.941
Also,
he can live decades.

14:14.984 --> 14:17.900
So it's a...
big commitment.

14:19.946 --> 14:22.209
You can tell he's a he?

14:22.252 --> 14:23.732
There are eight ways, yes.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.435
No way.

14:32.001 --> 14:33.481
Proof of life
was one thing,

14:33.524 --> 14:36.440
but asking my sister
to get back in bed
with the FBI?

14:36.484 --> 14:38.268
It's like signing
her own death warrant.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.488
She won't have
to reveal her whereabouts.

14:40.531 --> 14:42.055
She just has
to give them something

14:42.098 --> 14:42.925
to put her husband away.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.014
And he'll
have her killed.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.233
He hasn't found her,

14:46.276 --> 14:47.799
and the best way
to ensure that he doesn't

14:47.843 --> 14:49.018
is to put him in prison.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.674
Kathleen kept
her end of the bargain.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.198
Your son
was cleared of murder.

14:55.851 --> 14:56.939
I'm sorry.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.378
I have to protect my sister.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.610
Davia: Hey!
How was your first day?

15:15.653 --> 15:18.047
Ugh, I spent it all in HR
filling out paperwork,

15:18.091 --> 15:20.789
so not really
a first day yet.

15:20.832 --> 15:22.617
Hmm. You want some tea?

15:23.009 --> 15:23.923
Yes, please.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.928
And... some advice.

15:31.147 --> 15:33.454
Isaac showed up last night
out of the blue.

15:35.021 --> 15:35.935
He...

15:37.153 --> 15:39.373
wants to get back together
and be monogamous,

15:39.416 --> 15:41.941
just like I offered
before he up and left.

15:44.247 --> 15:46.815
I know you probably think
I should feel grateful

15:46.858 --> 15:48.817
that he's willing
to give me a second chance

15:48.860 --> 15:49.905
after I ruined everything.

15:50.906 --> 15:52.603
No. Not at all.

15:53.474 --> 15:56.172
You don't need to be grateful
just because a man loves you.

15:57.043 --> 16:00.655
Look, you have every right
to explore what you want
and need.

16:00.698 --> 16:02.265
You didn't kick Isaac
to the curb.

16:02.309 --> 16:03.832
You were honest about
how you were feeling

16:03.875 --> 16:05.703
and asked to open up
your relationship.

16:07.357 --> 16:09.098
I would never
judge you for that.

16:09.620 --> 16:10.839
Thank you.

16:10.882 --> 16:13.450
See, I mean,
I get that he was hurt,

16:13.494 --> 16:15.148
but I felt abandoned.

16:16.671 --> 16:17.889
Yeah,
I know the feeling.

16:19.413 --> 16:22.459
But speaking from experience,
Isaac's timing might suck.

16:23.765 --> 16:27.290
But if you do still love him
and you want to be monogamous,

16:27.334 --> 16:30.380
then the real question is,
can you forgive him for leaving?

16:33.731 --> 16:34.863
Did you forgive Dennis?

16:38.432 --> 16:39.520
I did.

16:43.219 --> 16:44.046
Here you are, sir.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.876
And for you.
Enjoy.

16:48.616 --> 16:51.619
So you said that
you needed to talk to me.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.753
- Claire: <i>What about?</i>
- I don't know.

16:55.797 --> 16:58.278
He just texted me
that he gave me a glowing
recommendation to Jackie

16:58.321 --> 16:59.583
and that he needs
to talk to me.

16:59.627 --> 17:01.803
<i>I think</i> <i>
I just don't respond.</i>

17:01.846 --> 17:02.978
Right?

17:03.022 --> 17:04.153
<i>What if he has</i> <i>
some intel on Jackie</i>

17:04.197 --> 17:05.024
<i>or Revitalize?</i>

17:06.155 --> 17:07.417
<i>You shouldn't</i> <i>
go in there blind.</i>

17:07.461 --> 17:08.766
<i>I agree.</i>

17:08.810 --> 17:09.854
<i>I think you should hear</i> <i>
what he has to say.</i>

17:09.898 --> 17:11.943
<i>If it's not too hard</i> <i>
to see him.</i>

17:11.987 --> 17:13.597
No. It-- It's fine.

17:14.903 --> 17:17.819
Evan: Yes, I needed
to talk to you because...

17:20.996 --> 17:23.390
Jackie wanted me to find out
if you could be trusted.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.611
But I didn't ask you here
to do her bidding.

17:30.005 --> 17:31.876
I asked you here because...

17:36.055 --> 17:38.231
I'm curious as to why
you're betraying your friends

17:38.274 --> 17:40.059
to work for the competition.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.671
Um... I'm curious.

17:44.324 --> 17:47.109
Were you aware that Jackie
was ripping off Bulk Beauty?

17:47.153 --> 17:49.590
No. No, I had no idea.

17:50.460 --> 17:51.635
And I don't approve.

17:53.246 --> 17:55.291
And knowing you,
I would've thought
that you don't either.

17:59.295 --> 18:00.514
Well, I don't.

18:02.037 --> 18:04.996
But, you know,
the Bulk Beauty girls
pushed me out

18:05.040 --> 18:06.563
because I was dating you,

18:06.607 --> 18:10.176
and, you know, they're taking
all my good ideas with them.

18:10.219 --> 18:12.395
So... the way I see it,

18:12.439 --> 18:16.007
I have every right
to take my good ideas
elsewhere.

18:19.750 --> 18:20.925
Okay.

18:25.408 --> 18:28.411
Is that the only reason
you needed to talk to me?

18:30.283 --> 18:34.025
Is there something else
that you wanted to talk about?

18:37.942 --> 18:39.205
No.

18:40.031 --> 18:43.818
Um, but you're welcome
to tell Jackie

18:43.861 --> 18:45.254
that she has nothing
to worry about.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.084
Thanks for the drink.

Show me.

19:19.680 --> 19:20.768
When did you get that?

19:21.334 --> 19:22.248
After you left.

19:25.251 --> 19:26.295
Does it mean anything?

19:28.254 --> 19:30.081
It reminds me
to love myself.

19:37.219 --> 19:38.829
Oh! Okay!

19:38.873 --> 19:40.483
I don't know
why you thought
you could do that.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.137
I see you've learned
a few things.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.226
I mean, you know...
Oh, yeah.

19:44.270 --> 19:45.749
- Oh, you ready now?
- Just know a thing or two. Yeah.

19:48.317 --> 19:51.015
Okay. So you-- you-- you--
getting there or something?

19:51.059 --> 19:52.321
I'm getting there.
I'm getting there.

19:52.365 --> 19:53.192
You're getting there.
You're getting there.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.758
Okay.

20:18.478 --> 20:19.609
Aaah!

20:20.915 --> 20:22.177
Thank you very much.
And the crowd goes wild.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.924
Jesus!

20:29.967 --> 20:31.578
Yuri:
You don't get married

20:31.621 --> 20:32.666
or divorced

20:32.709 --> 20:34.537
or have a kid
with a crazy woman!

20:41.414 --> 20:44.286
I haven't seen my daughter
for two years,

20:44.330 --> 20:47.724
and just now,
she bails on coming
to see me for the summer.

20:48.290 --> 20:51.032
She wants to spend it
with her friends.

20:53.904 --> 20:56.646
I should never have let her mom
take her to Australia.

21:01.303 --> 21:04.219
I missed out on so much
of their life already.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.178
Can't imagine
not seeing my kid.

21:08.354 --> 21:09.355
If Isabella moves away,

21:09.398 --> 21:12.314
I don't--
I don't know what I'd do.

21:13.359 --> 21:14.447
She's talking about moving

21:14.490 --> 21:17.058
until she is closer
to her due date.

21:18.886 --> 21:20.235
You can't let her do that.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.063
You don't know
if she's even gonna
come back

21:22.106 --> 21:23.194
to have the baby.

21:23.586 --> 21:25.327
Whatever it takes,

21:25.371 --> 21:27.242
if there is a way,
you've gotta make her stay.

21:36.599 --> 21:39.472
I owe everything
to you and Kathleen,

21:39.515 --> 21:40.647
the-- the whole team.

21:40.690 --> 21:43.040
I really appreciate
all you did for me

21:43.084 --> 21:44.607
and that you always
believed in me.

21:45.129 --> 21:48.698
Yeah, it's easy
to believe in someone
who's innocent.

21:50.570 --> 21:51.962
To not guilty.

22:00.406 --> 22:02.321
I, um, I know it's...

22:03.409 --> 22:05.498
It's hard to celebrate
when Zack's still gone.

22:07.195 --> 22:08.892
And nothing will
bring him back.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.897
It was just like
a terrible accident.

22:17.684 --> 22:19.294
And I know how much
you loved him.

22:26.432 --> 22:27.824
I need to tell you
something.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.740
And you're the only person
I trust.

22:32.438 --> 22:33.569
Yeah.

22:35.702 --> 22:38.879
That night, I tried
to get away from Zack
after we fought.

22:39.619 --> 22:42.361
I went to the drop-off
and-- and he followed me.

22:43.579 --> 22:45.538
He was pretty drunk
and still pissed.

22:47.235 --> 22:48.845
I tried to walk away,

22:48.889 --> 22:51.674
but Zack started shoving me
and swinging.

22:53.459 --> 22:56.549
And, finally,
I shoved him away,

22:56.592 --> 22:58.855
and he stumbled
and fell back over the edge.

23:02.206 --> 23:03.425
And I tried
to grab him.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.038
It all happened so fast.

23:09.562 --> 23:11.259
And I didn't think
that he'd be that hurt.

23:12.913 --> 23:14.044
I was just so...

23:14.610 --> 23:16.046
frustrated.

23:18.571 --> 23:21.574
I didn't wanna deal with
any of it until he sobered up,

23:21.617 --> 23:22.749
so I left the party.

23:26.579 --> 23:29.016
And I couldn't believe it
when I heard he was dead.

23:32.585 --> 23:33.760
I killed Zack.

23:35.588 --> 23:38.155
I didn't mean to,
but I killed him.

23:50.733 --> 23:51.865
Whatever.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.130
I thought
you were done with me.

23:59.220 --> 24:00.395
Nah, I just...

24:01.135 --> 24:02.223
needed some time
to think.

24:04.530 --> 24:05.835
Well, it felt like goodbye.

24:08.882 --> 24:11.188
You know, uh,
I asked you straight-up

24:11.232 --> 24:13.147
if you had feelings
for Dyonte,

24:13.190 --> 24:16.106
and, uh,
you told me no.

24:16.803 --> 24:18.108
I was confused

24:18.152 --> 24:21.503
because I was learning
new things about myself.

24:23.723 --> 24:24.724
And I'm still learning.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.120
And I'm...

24:31.644 --> 24:33.472
I'm so sorry
that I hurt you.

24:36.605 --> 24:38.433
I'm sorry that, uh...

24:38.868 --> 24:40.261
that I left.

24:42.655 --> 24:44.047
But I'm back.

24:44.744 --> 24:45.962
I'm here.

24:47.181 --> 24:48.530
To be with you.

24:48.574 --> 24:50.576
I miss you a lot
and, uh...

24:50.619 --> 24:51.533
I miss you too.

24:59.976 --> 25:01.848
Mariana:
Surprise!

25:01.891 --> 25:04.677
We didn't get to celebrate
your not-guilty verdict.

25:06.417 --> 25:07.593
This is so sweet.

25:07.636 --> 25:08.898
- Here you go.
- Wow.

25:12.685 --> 25:13.903
What's wrong?

25:14.600 --> 25:16.427
You look lower
than a gopher hole.

25:16.732 --> 25:18.429
Where did you
hear that?

25:18.473 --> 25:21.781
Oh, um, I was watching
a Dolly Parton documentary.

25:23.304 --> 25:24.653
But, for real,
what's wrong?

25:25.611 --> 25:27.003
Uh, I can't tell you.

25:27.047 --> 25:28.570
The story of my life.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.703
No, I really can't.
It's privileged.

25:30.746 --> 25:32.748
Well, whatever it is,

25:32.792 --> 25:34.358
don't let it
spoil your victory.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.235
It's not just that.

25:43.629 --> 25:46.501
Lately, I...
look in the mirror

25:46.545 --> 25:48.068
and I just don't know
who I am anymore.

25:50.461 --> 25:52.768
I'm just not where
I thought I'd be.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.337
Well, where
did you think you'd be?

25:58.426 --> 25:59.732
Not here.

26:03.779 --> 26:05.607
You're just tired.

26:05.651 --> 26:06.434
Here.

26:07.827 --> 26:08.958
How about a foot rub?

26:09.611 --> 26:10.960
Really? Why?

26:11.657 --> 26:14.616
Because you're my sister
and I love you.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.749
Jeez, stop
being so suspicious.

26:25.540 --> 26:26.454
Oh, good.

26:27.063 --> 26:30.066
Here, I have money.

26:33.940 --> 26:35.158
Don't worry,
it won't bounce.

26:35.898 --> 26:37.291
It's not that.

26:39.119 --> 26:40.816
I said
end-of-day yesterday,

26:40.860 --> 26:42.688
and when I didn't
hear from you,

26:42.731 --> 26:43.950
I leased the loft.

26:43.993 --> 26:45.691
Sumi, seriously?

26:46.648 --> 26:48.041
Why didn't--
Why didn't you
check in with me?

26:48.084 --> 26:49.216
I did-- I need this.

26:49.259 --> 26:50.957
I'm so, so sorry.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.307
Shit!
What am I gonna do now?

26:56.005 --> 26:57.180
Actually...

26:58.094 --> 26:59.574
I might have an idea.

27:01.707 --> 27:02.838
Wait, so...

27:03.796 --> 27:05.711
Alice is letting me
stay here for free?

27:07.974 --> 27:10.716
Good news,
you are $5,550 richer.

27:10.759 --> 27:12.543
<i>What? How? Why?</i>

27:12.587 --> 27:13.762
<i>Where did you go?</i>

27:13.806 --> 27:15.677
Do you know you have
a veritable fluffle

27:15.721 --> 27:17.548
of dust bunnies
under your bed?

27:17.592 --> 27:19.246
<i>Why are you under my bed?</i>

27:19.289 --> 27:20.377
<i>And what's a fluffle?</i>

27:20.421 --> 27:21.814
A large group of bunnies.

27:22.249 --> 27:23.990
And I sublet your loft.

27:24.033 --> 27:25.861
Alice: <i>
I didn't tell you</i> <i>
to sublet my loft.</i>

27:25.905 --> 27:27.776
You had a money problem,
and I fixed it.

27:27.820 --> 27:29.473
You shouldn't have
to go into debt

27:29.517 --> 27:30.910
to pursue your dream.

27:30.953 --> 27:33.042
<i>Okay, yeah,</i> <i>
but I don't want</i> <i>
some stranger</i>

27:33.086 --> 27:34.304
<i>sleeping on my bed.</i>

27:34.348 --> 27:36.829
<i>Uh, it's not a stranger.</i> <i>
It's Isabella.</i>

27:36.872 --> 27:38.091
<i>What? That's worse!</i>

27:38.134 --> 27:39.396
<i>I don't wanna take money</i> <i>
from a friend.</i>

27:39.440 --> 27:41.224
It's a business transaction.

27:41.268 --> 27:43.487
This is why you get
taken advantage of around here,
by the way.

27:43.531 --> 27:44.706
You are too nice,

27:44.750 --> 27:46.403
but not on my watch.

27:46.447 --> 27:48.971
<i>Absolute power truly</i> <i>
does corrupt absolutely.</i>

27:49.015 --> 27:51.017
You'll see,
this is good for you

27:51.060 --> 27:53.193
and for Isabella and Gael.

27:53.236 --> 27:54.847
It's good for everyone.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.413
Alice: <i>
Tell that to the fluffle</i> <i>
you're about to evict.</i>

27:56.457 --> 27:59.590
Oh, and by the way,
Gael doesn't want
Isabella to know

27:59.634 --> 28:01.201
that he paid
to sublet your loft.

28:01.244 --> 28:02.768
- So mum's the word. <i>
- Great!</i>

28:02.811 --> 28:03.769
Yep.

28:04.987 --> 28:06.989
Yeah. Yeah, you can
stay here for free.

28:07.033 --> 28:09.470
Wow! That is so nice
of Alice.

28:09.513 --> 28:12.038
And now you don't have to worry
about putting me out of my loft,

28:12.081 --> 28:14.562
so... you can stay.

28:14.997 --> 28:17.217
I really appreciate this,

28:18.827 --> 28:20.481
but I still need a job.

28:20.524 --> 28:24.224
You can't be the only one
working and saving for the baby.

28:24.267 --> 28:26.443
And Santa Barbara's
not that far.

28:27.314 --> 28:29.925
It's really not
worst-case scenario, okay?

28:32.798 --> 28:36.236
<i>♪ Yeah, she got a pretty face</i> <i>
Pretty face ♪</i>

28:37.759 --> 28:39.413
<i>♪ That I cannot take away</i>

28:40.806 --> 28:42.764
<i>♪ But I heard</i> <i>
she's pretty fake ♪</i>

28:43.939 --> 28:46.072
<i>♪ And she's too cool</i> <i>

28:46.115 --> 28:48.465
<i>♪ One, two, three</i>

28:48.509 --> 28:51.555
<i>♪ I'm out of here</i>

28:51.599 --> 28:54.820
<i>♪ Keep me far from her spell</i>

28:55.821 --> 28:58.258
It was amazing
to see you laughing today.

28:59.433 --> 29:01.087
And excited
about the food truck

29:01.130 --> 29:02.915
and the fact that you went
to the children's ward.

29:02.958 --> 29:03.829
It just--

29:04.873 --> 29:05.961
It all made me realize

29:06.005 --> 29:07.484
that you're ready
to live again.

29:12.489 --> 29:14.056
And it also
made me realize that...

29:15.754 --> 29:17.407
you don't need me anymore.

29:21.977 --> 29:24.980
And need was the foundation
of our relationship.

29:26.329 --> 29:28.027
You were broken,

29:28.897 --> 29:32.031
and I was intoxicated
with the idea of saving you.

29:35.425 --> 29:37.079
But you saved yourself.

29:41.823 --> 29:42.911
And there's a big difference

29:42.955 --> 29:45.131
between being needed
and wanted and...

29:48.917 --> 29:50.440
I want to be wanted.

29:54.053 --> 29:55.228
I love you so much.

29:57.621 --> 29:59.841
And I will always
be here for you.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.020
I love you too.

30:20.862 --> 30:23.038
Well, your truck looks
good enough to eat.

30:23.082 --> 30:24.910
- Yeah, that's the idea.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:27.260 --> 30:28.478
You okay?

30:29.349 --> 30:31.699
Yeah. Have fun
and get some toast.

30:33.005 --> 30:34.136
Okay.

30:39.925 --> 30:41.274
<i>♪ I must confess</i>

30:41.317 --> 30:44.016
<i>♪ I think they call this</i> <i>
happiness... ♪</i>

30:45.060 --> 30:46.845
Now, you know,
this toast is hella bougie.

30:46.888 --> 30:49.064
Yeah, it's extra
but it's free.

30:49.108 --> 30:50.283
And delicious.

30:51.284 --> 30:53.068
Girl, you are
glowing tonight,

30:53.112 --> 30:54.635
and it is not
the French toast.

30:55.070 --> 30:57.246
Oh! Excuse me,
is that a new tattoo?

30:58.073 --> 31:01.381
- It is.
- Oh, boy. Now what?

31:02.034 --> 31:03.035
What?

31:04.950 --> 31:06.777
- Isaac came back.
- all: What?

31:07.343 --> 31:08.562
He wanted
to get back together.

31:08.605 --> 31:09.737
all:
What?

31:09.780 --> 31:10.956
Okay, what did you say?

31:14.046 --> 31:16.396
I miss you...
a lot.

31:18.528 --> 31:19.312
I miss you too.

31:21.140 --> 31:22.054
So much.

31:28.974 --> 31:29.931
But...

31:32.281 --> 31:33.152
Isaac...

31:35.067 --> 31:35.981
I moved on.

31:40.986 --> 31:43.423
I have other relationships
I'm invested in.

31:49.037 --> 31:50.256
I love you...

31:55.087 --> 31:56.044
and...

31:57.524 --> 32:00.048
I wanna always be
a part of your life.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.182
If you let me.

32:13.235 --> 32:15.107
Listen, that's what
I'm talking about.

32:15.150 --> 32:17.109
- Good for you, Malika.
- Amen.

32:17.152 --> 32:20.155
So does that mean that
Isaac is up for grabs?

32:20.199 --> 32:22.766
- Now, girl?
- I was just playing. Y'all think I would do that?

32:22.810 --> 32:24.638
- Excuse me.
- I don't know, now.

32:26.901 --> 32:28.120
Be right back.

32:29.686 --> 32:30.513
Hey!

32:34.039 --> 32:35.866
Okay, he's cute.

32:37.129 --> 32:38.304
Um, hold on one second.

32:40.393 --> 32:41.611
- Hey!
- Hey!

32:42.221 --> 32:44.092
Okay, she cute too.

32:44.136 --> 32:45.615
I'm glad
you both could come.

32:45.659 --> 32:47.008
I've been wanting
you to meet.

32:47.704 --> 32:50.098
Dyonte, this is Angelica.

32:50.142 --> 32:52.144
Hi. I've heard
such great things
about you.

32:52.187 --> 32:53.145
Me too...

32:54.059 --> 32:55.364
about you.

32:55.408 --> 32:56.583
Kendy:
Look at her owning her world.

32:56.626 --> 32:58.498
Yeah, like a damn goddess.

32:58.541 --> 32:59.934
Maybe we should
get tattoos.

33:01.283 --> 33:02.328
What?

33:03.459 --> 33:05.113
Wait. Who is that guy?

33:08.334 --> 33:09.639
I have no idea.

33:11.206 --> 33:12.338
Sumi.

33:12.381 --> 33:13.904
Who's that guy
over there?

33:13.948 --> 33:15.428
Sumi:
Joaquin.

33:15.471 --> 33:18.039
He is our newest
Coterie member.

33:18.083 --> 33:20.041
He's an independent
investigative journalist

33:20.085 --> 33:23.044
who just did
a five-piece exposé
on deputy gangs

33:23.088 --> 33:24.393
in the Sheriff's Department.

33:24.437 --> 33:26.178
And best of all,

33:27.179 --> 33:28.876
he has a high credit score.

33:28.919 --> 33:31.226
Nice! Good job, Sumi!

33:31.270 --> 33:32.097
Thank you.

33:33.837 --> 33:37.015
Well, I should probably
go introduce myself

33:37.058 --> 33:38.103
since he doesn't
know anyone, right?

33:38.146 --> 33:39.800
Yeah, 'cause
he doesn't know anyone.

33:39.843 --> 33:41.019
- Mariana: Exactly!
- Right.

33:43.108 --> 33:46.763
- Hi, Joaquin, right?
- Yeah. Hi.

33:46.807 --> 33:49.244
I'm Mariana.
I live at the Coterie.

33:49.984 --> 33:52.247
We have family dinners
like once a week.

33:52.291 --> 33:54.597
Well, we're supposed to.
Everyone's so busy.

33:54.641 --> 33:56.773
But I'm sure you're gonna
love it here.

33:56.817 --> 33:58.384
I'm sure I will.
Thank you.

33:58.993 --> 34:00.690
I heard that
you're a journalist.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.084
That's the rumor.
What do you do?

34:03.128 --> 34:04.477
- I'm in tech.
- Ah.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.827
I heard you just did
a big exposé on deputy gangs

34:06.870 --> 34:08.133
in the Sheriff's Department.

34:08.176 --> 34:10.048
Yeah. What kind of tech
you do?

34:10.526 --> 34:12.050
App development.

34:12.093 --> 34:15.575
So were you afraid at all
to write about law enforcement?

34:15.618 --> 34:18.273
Apps, huh?
Like what? Like games?

34:18.578 --> 34:22.190
No, it's like, uh,
in the beauty area,
sustainable shopping.

34:22.756 --> 34:26.020
So did any of
the deputy gang members
threaten you?

34:26.064 --> 34:28.022
Well, they definitely
don't love me.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.676
What's, uh,
sustainable shopping?

34:31.025 --> 34:33.984
Do you always
answer a question
by asking another question?

34:34.333 --> 34:35.899
I thought we were just
having a conversation.

34:37.162 --> 34:39.642
Okay, never mind.
You're obviously
into playing games.

34:39.686 --> 34:41.296
Or, maybe
I just don't like

34:41.340 --> 34:43.472
sharing what I do for work
with perfect strangers,

34:43.516 --> 34:46.084
and my way
of politely
messaging that

34:46.127 --> 34:47.781
is to redirect
the conversation.

34:48.912 --> 34:53.091
Okay, well, do you think
that that was polite
or patronizing?

34:53.134 --> 34:55.005
What would you like me to say,
"It's none of your business"?

34:55.049 --> 34:57.051
Yeah, actually,
I would prefer the truth.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.271
Oh, okay.
Well, the truth is
I'm seeing someone.

34:59.314 --> 35:01.142
Oh, my God. Okay.

35:01.186 --> 35:03.275
Well, I mean, if we're
being completely honest,

35:03.318 --> 35:04.885
didn't you come over here
to flirt with me?

35:04.928 --> 35:08.280
Wow! You really are
in love with yourself.

35:08.323 --> 35:11.152
No, you were standing alone,
and I came over here

35:11.196 --> 35:12.545
because you obviously
don't know anyone.

35:12.588 --> 35:15.156
Oh, okay. Well, thank you.
Now I know you.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.158
So I'm gonna go get some toast.
Do you want anything?

35:17.202 --> 35:18.203
No.

35:18.551 --> 35:19.334
Okay.

35:23.947 --> 35:25.906
So what do you think
of the new guy?

35:25.949 --> 35:27.125
I think he's a dick.

35:28.343 --> 35:30.780
Never mind, I take it back.
Sumi?

35:30.824 --> 35:32.347
Bad job!

35:32.391 --> 35:34.175
Huh?
What did I do?

35:34.219 --> 35:35.568
Angelica: It's nice
to meet you.

35:35.611 --> 35:38.223
Nice to meet y'all too.
Heard so much about you.

35:38.266 --> 35:41.051
- Dyonte: Oh, yeah?
- Great things. Yeah, yeah.

35:41.095 --> 35:42.575
I didn't know y'all had
dimples though.

35:42.618 --> 35:44.403
- Kendy: That's cute.
- Tolu: That's real cute.

35:47.014 --> 35:49.059
- Gael: Hey.
- Hi.

35:50.583 --> 35:51.801
Did, um...

35:51.845 --> 35:54.021
Did Dennis tell you
he offered me a job?

35:54.064 --> 35:57.285
- Um, that's fantastic!
- I know.

35:57.894 --> 36:00.941
So, um, does this mean...

36:01.811 --> 36:03.204
Yes.

36:03.248 --> 36:04.814
This means
that I'm saying.

36:06.294 --> 36:08.688
I can't believe
how kind everyone's been
to me.

36:08.731 --> 36:10.777
But, of course,
that's just a testament

36:10.820 --> 36:12.039
to how much they love you.

36:12.082 --> 36:13.432
Oh, they all
love you too.

36:14.302 --> 36:15.738
And they're gonna
love the baby.

36:15.782 --> 36:18.393
And, you know what they say,
it does take a village.

36:18.437 --> 36:21.353
Yeah, I'm really lucky
to be a part of this one.

36:33.060 --> 36:34.192
Thank you.

36:34.931 --> 36:36.106
I owe you one.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.544
She knows her stuff, man.

36:38.587 --> 36:40.285
She's good.
She'll save my ass.

36:43.505 --> 36:44.767
How's that going?

36:45.333 --> 36:46.291
She was right.

36:47.727 --> 36:50.382
I need to get
my shit together,
but when I do,

36:51.774 --> 36:53.167
who knows
what's meant to be?

36:58.825 --> 37:02.263
<i>♪ I said I'm done, but still</i> <i>
you act like that guy ♪</i>

37:02.307 --> 37:04.657

<i>♪ It's all on my mind</i>

37:17.235 --> 37:19.498

- Yeah.

37:20.150 --> 37:21.804
I have a rule, new guy.

37:22.501 --> 37:23.893
I don't sex where I eat.

37:24.503 --> 37:25.286
Then again,

37:26.592 --> 37:27.941
rules suck.

37:29.334 --> 37:31.466
- Let's dance.
- Oh, I don't know about that.

37:32.337 --> 37:33.729
I'm not really...

37:33.773 --> 37:35.644
I'm not really a dancer,
but okay.

38:18.339 --> 38:19.906
- Matt: <i>Hi.</i>
- Hi.

38:19.949 --> 38:21.560
How's the conference going?

38:21.603 --> 38:25.955
<i>Boring. Uh, but San Francisco</i> <i>
is a-- a big upgrade</i>

38:25.999 --> 38:28.175
<i>from last year</i> <i>
in Bisbee, Arizona.</i>

38:28.218 --> 38:29.132
Yeah, I'll say.

38:30.917 --> 38:33.223
So, uh, I was gonna wait
until you got back,

38:33.267 --> 38:35.443
but I just really
wanna tell you.

38:37.576 --> 38:39.404
I'm not confused
about Dennis anymore.

38:40.622 --> 38:41.841
I know what I want.

38:42.798 --> 38:43.973
And I want you.

38:50.502 --> 38:51.807
Am I on mute here?

38:53.026 --> 38:54.984
<i>No, sorry. Um...</i>

38:56.203 --> 38:57.422
<i>It's just...</i>

38:57.465 --> 39:00.338
<i>I-- I've had some time</i> <i>
to... think here.</i>

39:01.339 --> 39:03.123
<i>And I've seen you</i> <i>
with Dennis,</i>

39:03.689 --> 39:06.169
<i>and... I really believe</i>

39:06.213 --> 39:09.999
<i>that you don't want to...</i> <i>
still be in love with him.</i>

39:10.783 --> 39:12.915
<i>But I'm just not convinced</i> <i>
that you're not.</i>

39:15.178 --> 39:16.702
<i>And I don't wanna be</i> <i>
your rebound guy.</i>

39:16.745 --> 39:19.748
<i>I care about you</i> <i>
so much that-- that...</i>

39:20.662 --> 39:23.273
<i>I don't want to set myself up</i> <i>
to maybe get my heart broken.</i>

39:26.755 --> 39:27.887
<i>And if I'm honest,</i>

39:29.541 --> 39:32.935
<i>I want someone who doesn't need</i> <i>
to take weeks to figure out</i>

39:32.979 --> 39:34.676
<i>if they wanna be with me.</i>

39:35.938 --> 39:37.636
<i>I want someone</i> <i>
who just knows.</i>

39:42.292 --> 39:44.207
It's strange, right?

39:44.251 --> 39:45.557
After everything
we've been through,

39:45.600 --> 39:46.906
we end up
on opposite sides

39:46.949 --> 39:48.821
in a murder case
of all things.

39:49.561 --> 39:50.649
Yeah.

39:52.215 --> 39:54.304
Kinda seems like
the universe keeps
pushing us together.

40:00.049 --> 40:00.876
Um...

40:02.443 --> 40:07.317
I've been thinking about
how I can be...

40:08.449 --> 40:10.756
a little
"my way or the highway."

40:12.453 --> 40:18.111
And I've held everyone
up to this black-and-white
standard.

40:19.460 --> 40:24.422
But... I think we all
really just exist in the gray.

40:27.686 --> 40:29.992
And I couldn't believe it <i>
when I heard he was dead.</i>

40:31.037 --> 40:32.647
I killed Zack.

40:32.691 --> 40:35.258
<i>I didn't mean to,</i> <i>
but I killed him.</i>

40:37.522 --> 40:39.654
You recorded my son.

40:41.134 --> 40:42.440
Why?

40:45.007 --> 40:46.879
There was
a moment in the trial,

40:46.922 --> 40:48.881
<i>Kathleen said</i> <i>
something to the jury,</i>

40:48.924 --> 40:50.448
<i>they looked at Tommy</i> <i>
and he welled up,</i>

40:51.623 --> 40:52.972
<i>like he was coached.</i>

40:53.494 --> 40:56.671
<i>And I don't trust anyone</i> <i>
who can cry on cue.</i>

40:56.715 --> 40:59.239
Good boy.
He's really selling it.

41:05.550 --> 41:06.768
It doesn't matter.

41:06.812 --> 41:09.031
Tommy's already been found
not guilty.

41:09.292 --> 41:12.295
He can't be tried again,
it's double jeopardy.

41:12.339 --> 41:13.427
That's true.

41:15.124 --> 41:17.126
But if you
don't help Kathleen,

41:17.170 --> 41:19.041
I'll send this
to Zack's family.

41:19.085 --> 41:21.261
They'll sue in civil court
for wrongful death.

41:21.304 --> 41:22.567
Tommy's life
will be destroyed.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.917
He'll be branded
a murderer.

41:24.960 --> 41:27.528
No college,
no job prospects,

41:27.572 --> 41:29.487
and you'll end up
financially ruined.

41:31.314 --> 41:35.667
So the ball is, as they say,
in your court.

41:43.196 --> 41:45.372
I guess, um,
what I'm trying to say...

41:46.460 --> 41:50.812
is I've learned that sometimes
when you represent a client,

41:50.856 --> 41:54.163
you have to do things
you may not feel good about.

41:55.077 --> 41:56.514
And I judged you for that,

41:58.516 --> 41:59.647
with the Anwei situation,

42:01.431 --> 42:03.129
and I betrayed your trust.

42:05.871 --> 42:07.220
I'm sorry.

42:13.531 --> 42:14.793
I have also learned...

42:16.142 --> 42:17.926
that betraying
your personal ethics

42:17.970 --> 42:19.537
isn't always justified,

42:21.408 --> 42:23.410
even in the pursuit
of representing a client.

42:25.499 --> 42:28.502
And that sometimes,
you need someone
to keep you accountable.

42:35.378 --> 42:36.728
I still love you,
you know?

42:43.648 --> 42:45.171
I still love you too.

42:58.576 --> 42:59.577
I...

43:01.448 --> 43:04.625
I can't keep jumping
from one relationship
back to another.

43:08.586 --> 43:09.891
I need to...

43:12.111 --> 43:14.983
figure out who I am
and what I'm really doing.

43:18.639 --> 43:19.684
Yeah, I understand.

43:22.861 --> 43:24.036
I support you with that.

43:27.256 --> 43:29.607
I got my own soul searching to do.

43:35.221 --> 43:37.527
I've been--
I've been thinking like

43:38.441 --> 43:40.443
that all of this
is as good as it gets.

43:41.096 --> 43:43.142
For me, you know?

43:45.448 --> 43:46.841
Maybe it's not.

43:46.885 --> 43:48.190
Yeah.

43:48.234 --> 43:50.497
No, maybe-- maybe
I can have like...

43:52.238 --> 43:54.196
Maybe I can have
the moon and the stars,

43:55.371 --> 43:56.503
if I just...

43:56.808 --> 43:58.548
find the courage
to reach for them.

44:04.685 --> 44:06.295
Maybe to do that, I...

44:07.470 --> 44:09.647
need to make
some big life changes.

44:10.691 --> 44:11.866
How big?

44:15.478 --> 44:16.654
Big.
