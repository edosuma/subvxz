00:01.300 --> 00:03.222
Previously on Elementary...
Hi, I'm Andrew Mittal.

00:03.270 --> 00:06.034
What, you found
your next business?
I think so.

00:06.070 --> 00:08.061
So I called the airline, and
I can't stay the whole time,

00:08.100 --> 00:10.364
but I've always wanted
to see Copenhagen.

00:12.140 --> 00:13.801
You say that I saved you,

00:13.840 --> 00:16.809
but the way that I see it,

00:16.850 --> 00:18.704
you gave me everything.

00:18.750 --> 00:20.718
Have you decided
where you're going to go?

00:20.750 --> 00:23.719
Your romantic inclinations are
not a flaw to be corrected,

00:23.750 --> 00:25.183
they're a trait to be accepted.

00:25.220 --> 00:26.778
I know you, Watson.

00:26.820 --> 00:28.788
I know you'll never be happy
within the confines

00:28.820 --> 00:30.629
of a "traditional relationship."

00:30.660 --> 00:32.252
I'm happy with Andrew.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.188
But would you be happier
without him?

00:37.430 --> 00:40.638
HOLMES: Elizabeth Short--
she disappeared January the 9th.

00:40.670 --> 00:43.639
Her body was found,
bisected and exsanguinated,

00:43.670 --> 00:45.661
on January the 14th.

00:45.710 --> 00:46.677
Exsanguinated?

00:46.710 --> 00:48.268
Drained of blood.

00:48.310 --> 00:49.572
Oh.

00:49.610 --> 00:51.544
Elizabeth Short.

00:51.580 --> 00:52.740
I know the name.

00:52.780 --> 00:54.748
The press dubbed her
"The Black Dahlia"

00:54.780 --> 00:56.589
shortly after
her murder.

00:56.620 --> 00:58.815
Yeah, I maintain,
um, several files

00:58.850 --> 01:01.080
of unsolved_cases
to keep me stimulated

01:01.120 --> 01:02.485
when interesting work
fails to come in.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.327
And this is one
of them.

01:04.360 --> 01:08.319
How are you supposed to solve
a murder from the 1930s?

01:08.360 --> 01:09.668
1947.

01:09.700 --> 01:10.769
It's not impossible.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.336
I did it with
the Whitechapel killings,

01:12.370 --> 01:13.689
and they date back
to the 18005.

01:13.740 --> 01:14.764
Whitechapel?

01:14.800 --> 01:16.768
You knew who Jack
the Ripper is?

01:16.810 --> 01:18.766
See, I-I've long
postulated a connection

01:18.810 --> 01:20.778
between the death
of Ms. Short

01:20.810 --> 01:22.607
and the killing
of a young girl in Chicago

01:22.650 --> 01:24.606
named Suzanne Degnan
in the year prior.

01:24.650 --> 01:27.517
See, letters from both killers
use similar phrasing

01:27.550 --> 01:29.381
and similar combinations
of letters.

01:29.420 --> 01:30.387
Don't you think?

01:30.420 --> 01:31.819
Maybe.

01:31.850 --> 01:32.817
I don't know.

01:32.860 --> 01:33.815
No, no, b-but look.

01:33.860 --> 01:34.815
Wh-What do you think?

01:34.860 --> 01:36.487
J-Just venture
an opinion.

01:37.760 --> 01:39.751
Well, wh-what about you?

01:43.770 --> 01:45.726
I don't know.

01:45.770 --> 01:48.534
Can we do something
besides talk about murder?

01:51.740 --> 01:53.731
(Holmes speaks in Hindi)

02:10.960 --> 02:13.155
Are you lonely?

02:15.630 --> 02:17.621
That's not the point.

02:18.970 --> 02:21.564
Jack Anderson Wilson
IS a valuable suspect,

02:21.600 --> 02:23.602
but there's no evidence
he was ever In Chicago.

02:24.840 --> 02:27.832
Wilson sometimes used
the alias Arnold Smith.

02:27.880 --> 02:30.849
If I can demonstrate that
Arnold Smith went to Chicago,

02:30.880 --> 02:32.871
then we might have
something worth discussing.

02:34.620 --> 02:36.611
Not that you're much
of a conversationalist.

02:39.890 --> 02:41.881
(doorbell rings and buzzes)

02:44.490 --> 02:45.855
State your business.

02:45.890 --> 02:47.790
Um...

02:47.830 --> 02:48.819
My name is, uh,
Jill Horowitz.

02:48.860 --> 02:50.327
Uh, an acquaintance
of mine says

02:50.370 --> 02:51.792
you're the best
P.I. in the city.

02:51.830 --> 02:53.934
Is this a bad time?

02:53.970 --> 02:56.165
On the contrary,
it's the perfect time.

02:58.640 --> 03:02.542
My husband Steven is an
attorney at Dorchester-Reid.

03:03.950 --> 03:05.770
You say those words
as if they're supposed

03:05.810 --> 03:07.243
_ to_hold some
Significance for me.

03:07.280 --> 03:09.919
It's one of the top
law firms in the city.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.758
Steven has been, um,
distant lately.

03:15.790 --> 03:16.984
Works odd hours,

03:17.030 --> 03:19.590
makes ridiculous
excuses.

03:19.630 --> 03:21.996
(chuckles) For a lavwer,
he's a terrible liar.

03:22.030 --> 03:24.794
You suspect your husband
is having an affair.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.798
He has to be.

03:26.840 --> 03:30.799
They work long hours, but lately
it's been worse than usual.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.808
Steven has pulled plenty
of all-nighters,

03:32.840 --> 03:35.809
but I_haven't seen him
in two days.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.673
You haven't seen or spoken
to your husband in 48 hours?

03:39.950 --> 03:42.441
He's missing.
Please.

03:42.490 --> 03:45.448
You have to lead an interesting
life to be missing.

03:45.490 --> 03:47.458
All Steven does is work.

03:47.490 --> 03:48.616
He left me.

03:48.660 --> 03:51.288
I want you to do
the P.I. thing.

03:51.330 --> 03:53.423
Find where he is, who he's with.

03:53.460 --> 03:55.496
Get me some pictures
that I can use in court.

03:55.530 --> 03:56.963
You keep using the phrase "P.I."

03:57.000 --> 03:57.989
That's not what I do.

03:58.030 --> 04:00.794
The marital squabbles
of two petit bourgeois

04:00.840 --> 04:02.501
Manhattanites interest me
not a whit.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.502
Fine.

04:05.540 --> 04:07.508
Normally, that is,
they'd interest me not a whit.

04:07.540 --> 04:08.905
But you've caught me
at something

04:08.940 --> 04:10.009
of a vulnerable moment.

04:11.580 --> 04:13.844
I could use a distraction.

04:19.590 --> 04:22.559
That's a pretty
good likeness.

04:22.590 --> 04:25.980
Imagine sitting for an oil
portrait in this day and age.

04:26.030 --> 04:28.749
The hubris practically
leaks off the canvas.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.722
(Watson sighs)

04:31.770 --> 04:33.863
You had sex this morning.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.731
Excuse me?

04:35.770 --> 04:38.330
Your stride indicates_
a recent release of ten5ion.

04:38.370 --> 04:40.702
Is Andrew in town?

04:40.740 --> 04:42.901
Or have you taken
another lover?

04:42.950 --> 04:44.076
He got in yesterday.

04:44.110 --> 04:45.873
He's back in town for good.

04:45.910 --> 04:47.377
The model factory's up
and running in Copenhagen,

04:47.420 --> 04:48.876
so now he can work
from the States.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.081
And you can be
a full-time couple.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.417
You must be thrilled.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.416
Absolutely.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.779
Sure.

04:57.660 --> 04:59.628
So why are we looking
into a cheating husband?

04:59.660 --> 05:00.797
Are you that
desperate for work?

05:00.830 --> 05:03.867
I used to relish
my solitude.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.095
But the truth is,
I've grown accustomed

05:06.130 --> 05:08.098
to having a companion
at the brownstone.

05:08.140 --> 05:10.005
The place feels a little bit
empty these days.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.803
No word from Kitty?

05:13.410 --> 05:15.799
You know you can always
call me if you want to talk.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.808
You want
your independence.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.340
I will not intrude.

05:21.580 --> 05:25.539
Anyway, this work might
turn out to be interesting.

05:25.590 --> 05:27.558
Before you got here,
I told the receptionist

05:27.590 --> 05:28.989
I was here
to see Steven Horowitz.

05:29.020 --> 05:31.079
She said there's no one
of that name working here.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.121
His wife said
Dorchester-Reid, right?

05:33.160 --> 05:35.025
Mm-hmm.
(footsteps approach)

05:35.060 --> 05:36.994
You're the ones
looking for Steven?

05:37.030 --> 05:38.668
Look, I don't know
what to tell you.

05:38.700 --> 05:41.066
Steven was an associate here
until about SIX months ago.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.499
They let him go.

05:42.540 --> 05:43.962
Do you know why?

05:44.010 --> 05:44.965
We have a bloodletting
from time to time.

05:45.010 --> 05:47.001
Guess they didn't think
he was partner material.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.645
_ His_ wife is under the
impre55ion he still works here.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.001
She gave us a phone number
which matches your exchanges.

05:52.050 --> 05:54.018
Like I said,
don't know what to tell you.

05:54.050 --> 05:55.017
But I got to go.

05:55.050 --> 05:56.039
This isn't billable.

05:59.890 --> 06:01.915
(sighs)

06:01.960 --> 06:03.120
What are you doing?

06:03.160 --> 06:05.958
I'm calling the number
Steven's wife gave us.

06:05.990 --> 06:08.788
(phone rings)

06:08.830 --> 06:10.491
WOMAN:
Steven Horowitz's office.

06:10.530 --> 06:12.589
Yes, hello, is that
the same Steven Horowitz

06:12.640 --> 06:14.460
who works as an attorney
at Dorchester-Reid?

06:14.500 --> 06:16.138
That's right.

06:18.110 --> 06:20.806
You're thinking whoever answered
the phone is somewhere in there.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.102
Mm-hmm.

06:22.140 --> 06:23.744
Excuse me.

06:23.780 --> 06:25.099
I'll only be
a moment, I'm just...

06:29.150 --> 06:31.141
(line ringing, phone ringing)

06:33.160 --> 06:34.957
WOMAN:
Steven Horowitz's office.

06:34.990 --> 06:36.423
Hello, is he in?

06:36.460 --> 06:38.121
Not at the moment--
can I take a message?

06:38.160 --> 06:39.957
I'd really like
to speak with him.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.956
We're supposed to be playing
racquetball at the moment.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.662
Racquetball?
Steven doesn't play racquetball.

06:44.700 --> 06:46.861
Are you telling me I'm not
standing on a racquetball court

06:46.900 --> 06:48.094
as we speak?

06:48.140 --> 06:50.506
I don't know where
you are, Sir.

06:50.540 --> 06:51.939
Well, that's a shame.

06:51.970 --> 06:53.608
If you had a bit more
spatial awareness,

06:53.640 --> 06:55.631
you'd realize I was standing
right behind you.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.945
Would you mind telling us
why you're pretending

06:59.980 --> 07:01.447
to be the secretary of a man

07:01.480 --> 07:02.742
who hasn't worked here
in SIX months?

07:46.700 --> 07:48.497
Please, you can't tell anyone

07:48.530 --> 07:49.963
that I am still answering
Steven's phones.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.558
They are always
looking for an excuse

07:51.600 --> 07:53.136
to fire people
around here.

07:53.170 --> 07:57.129
Admins are in charge
of deactivating the phones

07:57.170 --> 08:00.139
when someone is let go,
but Steven begged me not to.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.876
He pays me a little every week
just to keep answering.

08:02.910 --> 08:05.845
So he wants people to think
he's still working here.

08:05.880 --> 08:06.847
I guess.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.711
It's mostly his wife who calls.

08:08.750 --> 08:11.514
Just forward it
to a cell most of the time.

08:11.550 --> 08:13.211
That's kind of a big lie--
she never caught on?

08:13.260 --> 08:16.218
Steven and Jill are not
the most connected couple.

08:16.260 --> 08:18.854
She does a lot of charity work,
he works long hours.

08:18.890 --> 08:20.596
I guess she would have
found out eventually,

08:20.630 --> 08:22.222
but I'm not surprised
he fooled her.

08:22.260 --> 08:24.820
Is there any reason
why he didn't just tell her?

08:24.870 --> 08:26.292
He never said.

08:26.330 --> 08:29.060
But the name "Dorchester-Reid"
opens a lot of doors.

08:29.100 --> 08:31.068
Steven and Jill live
in a co-op building,

08:31.110 --> 08:32.907
they belong
to the Braebury Club.

08:32.940 --> 08:35.704
I guess he just wanted
to keep up appearances.

08:38.780 --> 08:40.748
I handled Steven's mail
for two years.

08:40.780 --> 08:43.749
He didn't have much savings,

08:43.790 --> 08:46.588
but there was money
coming in from somewhere.

08:46.620 --> 08:48.713
You think he_was involved
in something illegal?

08:48.760 --> 08:50.250
I don't know.

08:50.290 --> 08:52.690
But his wife wasn't
the only one who called.

08:52.730 --> 08:55.619
Some of the other people
sounded a little...

08:55.660 --> 08:57.264
I don't know, shady?

08:57.300 --> 08:59.632
Most of them wouldn't
even leave their names.

08:59.670 --> 09:02.707
When he offered me money
to answer the phones,

09:02.740 --> 09:04.332
I assumed I'd get
a check every week.

09:04.370 --> 09:06.008
Instead, he sent cash.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.133
It was like he didn't want
there to be a paper trail.

09:08.180 --> 09:09.329
Did you get paid recently?

09:09.380 --> 09:11.974
Yeah, I got an envelope
a couple days ago.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.149
I was gonna bring it
to the bank at lunch.

09:14.180 --> 09:17.149
Can I...?

09:21.720 --> 09:24.223
Thanks.

09:24.260 --> 09:26.854
WATSON :
No return address.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.698
Postmarked 11101.

09:29.730 --> 09:31.869
Long Island City.
It's not near his home.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.731
Perhaps it's near
his new business.

09:41.710 --> 09:43.678
This stain is horchata.

09:43.710 --> 09:46.008
Specifically,
Salvadoran horchata.

09:46.050 --> 09:47.677
The morro seeds
give it away.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.312
So his office might
be near a place

09:49.350 --> 09:51.739
that serves Salvadoran food
in Long Island City.

09:51.790 --> 09:54.179
Mmm. Thank you.
You've been most helpful.

09:54.220 --> 09:58.281
You're free to resume your life
of tedium and petty deception.

10:01.930 --> 10:04.319
I give you Long Island City's
foremost purveyors

10:04.370 --> 10:07.168
of tamales, pupusas,
and, of course, horchata.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.168
According to the online reviews,

10:09.200 --> 10:11.361
the cuisine is thoroughly
authentic, although the ambience

10:11.410 --> 10:14.379
can be ruined by the appearance
of an occasional rat.

10:14.410 --> 10:16.901
WATSON:
That explains the notice
from the health department.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.269
So, what are we
looking for here?

10:18.310 --> 10:20.312
Signs of Steven?

10:24.150 --> 10:27.415
Hey, have you ever thought
about getting a roommate?

10:27.460 --> 10:29.655
At times, you seem
to understand me quite well,

10:29.690 --> 10:31.351
and then you'll do something
like ask if I've considered

10:31.390 --> 10:32.926
taking on a flatmate.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.393
Why is that such
a weird question?

10:34.430 --> 10:37.024
You like being around people.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.368
You are not people, Watson.
Neither was Kitty.

10:39.400 --> 10:40.799
People, in case
you haven't noticed,

10:40.840 --> 10:42.762
are a crassulent,
beef-witted lot.

10:42.810 --> 10:45.233
Okay, no idea what
crassulent means,

10:45.270 --> 10:47.431
but I'm not saying
take an ad online.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.368
I mean, you've got a lot of
interesting acquaintances.

10:49.410 --> 10:52.140
I'm _sure one of them wouldn't
mind getting a cheap room

10:52.180 --> 10:53.670
in a huge brownstone.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.449
And who do you have in mind?

10:55.480 --> 10:59.109
Well, it probably shouldn't be
someone from the program.

10:59.150 --> 11:00.981
Hey, what about Ms. Hudson?
She's smart.

11:01.020 --> 11:03.989
I know far too much about
that woman's love life as it is.

11:04.030 --> 11:06.453
Hmm, Mason's too young.

11:06.490 --> 11:08.697
What about the Nose?

11:08.730 --> 11:09.890
He seems tidy.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.727
The Nose owns half
of Washington Heights.

11:11.770 --> 11:14.295
I hardly think he has use
for my spare bedroom.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.967
Well, there has
to be somebody.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.706
Oh, thank goodness.
For what?

11:17.740 --> 11:19.879
I found a way
out of this conversation.

11:19.910 --> 11:21.377
The file I gave you
on Horowitz,

11:21.410 --> 11:23.139
you read the piece
about his car?

11:23.180 --> 11:25.705
Yeah, black Lexus, license plate
begins with a "P," I think.

11:25.750 --> 11:27.217
PCT

11:27.250 --> 11:29.138
2093.

11:29.180 --> 11:30.488
This is his car.

11:30.520 --> 11:33.114
Oh.

11:37.460 --> 11:40.099
Street cleaning violation.

11:40.130 --> 11:41.722
Wednesday afternoon.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.762
This car has been here
for a few days.

11:45.230 --> 11:47.232
SMH Incorporated.

11:47.270 --> 11:49.261
Steven Matthew Horowitz.

11:56.540 --> 11:58.747
(lock clicking)

12:06.790 --> 12:09.827
(sighs) Looks like this place
shut down in a hurry.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.028
Judging by the age of the mold
that has accrued in this cup,

12:18.070 --> 12:19.935
I'd say it was active
less than a week ago.

12:19.970 --> 12:23.406
So around the same time
that Steven disappeared.

12:24.870 --> 12:27.179
The two are in all
likelihood connected.

12:27.210 --> 12:29.201
The question is,
which came first?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.511
WATSON:
A lot of phones.

12:35.550 --> 12:38.314
Looks like they were
selling something.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.386
See the way the dust
has settled?

12:46.430 --> 12:49.024
WATSON:
There was a carpet runner here

12:49.060 --> 12:50.527
on the floor
until a few days ago.

12:50.570 --> 12:51.889
The fire extinguisher
is missing.

12:51.930 --> 12:54.535
No sign of a fire.

12:54.570 --> 12:57.437
I suspect it was used
for off-label purposes.

13:01.180 --> 13:02.977
Looks like blood.

13:07.950 --> 13:10.942
(groans)

13:17.430 --> 13:20.922
This is reason enough
to call Captain Gregson.

13:23.430 --> 13:25.421
That's a piece of brain matter.

13:27.470 --> 13:29.267
I just talked to the ME.

13:29.300 --> 13:32.565
Preliminary DNA confirms that
the blood and brain matter

13:32.610 --> 13:34.134
both belong
to Steven Horowitz.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.171
Well, we got canine units
combing the area.

13:36.210 --> 13:37.404
No sign of a body.

13:37.450 --> 13:38.849
Be very surprised
if you find one.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.575
The killer most likely
wrapped it

13:40.620 --> 13:43.509
in the missing carpet runner
and then transported it by car.

13:43.550 --> 13:45.848
So he could've gone anywhere.
He?

13:45.890 --> 13:46.549
Well, Steven Horowitz
kept himself

13:46.590 --> 13:48.251
in reasonably good shape.

13:48.290 --> 13:49.552
I think it's very unlikely
that a woman

13:49.590 --> 13:50.989
beat him to death
with a fire extinguisher.

13:51.030 --> 13:52.156
Though not impossible,
of course.

13:52.190 --> 13:53.851
Watson, I've got
every confidence

13:53.900 --> 13:55.253
that you could brain a man
with a metal tube

13:55.300 --> 13:56.358
if you put your
mind to it.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.424
That's very nice
of you to say.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.358
What about the wife?

13:59.400 --> 14:01.334
You said they didn't get along?

14:01.370 --> 14:03.600
You think she could've
hired someone to do this?

14:03.640 --> 14:05.164
Well, we can't rule it out.

14:05.210 --> 14:06.905
But I can't imagine why
she would commit murder

14:06.940 --> 14:08.202
and then hire me.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.946
Hmm.

14:09.980 --> 14:11.902
Where are we on SMH Inc.?

14:11.950 --> 14:13.042
Any idea what it is yet?

14:13.080 --> 14:15.378
It's been around since August.

14:15.420 --> 14:17.615
Steven Horowitz was
the only officer on record,

14:17.650 --> 14:19.880
so we're pulling the W-25
to look for employees.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.080
I'll let you know
what we get.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.280
WATSON:
What about the phone records?

14:22.320 --> 14:23.924
The offices were clearly

14:25.230 --> 14:26.629
We're running that down.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.059
Everyone's closed for the night,

14:28.100 --> 14:30.364
but we should have
them first thing.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.061
Okay, I got to notify
the wife.

14:32.100 --> 14:33.567
(sighs)

14:33.600 --> 14:35.534
Perhaps you and I should retire
to my home,

14:35.570 --> 14:37.458
develop further theories.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.909
What's to develop?
We'll get the records

14:38.940 --> 14:39.634
in the morning
and go from there.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.044
Oh, would you rather
not be alone?

14:43.080 --> 14:44.274
Don't talk twaddle.

14:44.310 --> 14:46.244
I just want to maintain focus.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.441
Well, I'd hang out,
but I'm making dinner
with Andrew tonight.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.640
Well, I don't hang out, Watson.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.284
Well, call me

14:51.320 --> 14:53.880
if you're going crazy,
and think about the roommate.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.952
I'm not moving in with you.

14:56.990 --> 14:58.651
I didn't ask you to.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.658
ANDREW:
The Tribeca space

15:00.700 --> 15:02.998
is obviously centrally located,

15:03.030 --> 15:05.191
but I don't know.
It's small.

15:05.230 --> 15:06.697
And it's Tribeca.

15:06.730 --> 15:08.664
People are very cool in Tribeca.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.167
You're cool.
Thanks.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.632
You know what I mean.

15:11.670 --> 15:13.706
If I go to Bushwick,
I get actual bay windows,

15:13.740 --> 15:16.629
an office with a
door that closes,

15:16.680 --> 15:18.204
and room to grow.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.377
Well, sounds like you already
made up your mind.

15:21.980 --> 15:23.584
Go Bushwick.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.579
So, dinner is ready.

15:27.620 --> 15:29.713
Okay, don't judge me.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.682
(chuckles)
Ah.

15:31.730 --> 15:34.494
Oh, uh, hey,
my dad called this afternoon.

15:34.530 --> 15:35.724
Uh, he's in town tomorrow
on business.

15:35.760 --> 15:39.093
He wants to take
us out for dinner.

15:39.130 --> 15:40.666
If you're free, that is.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.429
Uh, sure.

15:42.470 --> 15:44.335
I'd love to meet him.

15:44.370 --> 15:46.031
Don't worry.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.606
It's not meeting my dad.

15:47.640 --> 15:48.675
It's just dinner.

15:48.710 --> 15:51.042
Totally low-key.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.570
Can I tell him 7:30?

15:54.380 --> 15:55.677
Yeah.

15:55.720 --> 15:58.086
(chuckles)

16:00.090 --> 16:01.682
WOMAN:
Do you feel good about yourself?
Hello!

16:01.720 --> 16:03.449
Seriously,
at the end of the day,

16:03.490 --> 16:05.048
do you think,
"Wow, I really harassed

16:05.090 --> 16:06.352
a lot of people today?"

16:06.390 --> 16:07.721
'Cause I think
ifI had your job,

16:07.760 --> 16:09.318
I'd probably just kill myself.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.294
Madam, I merely obtained
your phone number

16:11.330 --> 16:12.991
through SMH Incorporated.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.031
I am not affiliated with them.

16:15.070 --> 16:16.435
I'm warning you,
don't call here again.

16:16.470 --> 16:19.064
(line disconnects)
Friend of yours?

16:19.110 --> 16:21.101
That was Ms. Ruth Talbert

16:21.140 --> 16:23.040
from Taos, New Mexico.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.604
Detective Bell sent
the phone records

16:24.650 --> 16:26.174
from Steven's of_fice
earlier this morning.

16:26.210 --> 16:28.041
I've been calling the numbers
in an effort

16:28.080 --> 16:30.116
to find out what
SMH Incorporated was up to

16:30.150 --> 16:31.788
and perhaps turn up
a suspect or two.

16:31.820 --> 16:34.015
Sounds like you found one.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.984
As a matter of fact,
I found thousands of them.

16:38.430 --> 16:41.126
Everyone who received
a phone call

16:41.160 --> 16:44.721
from SMH Incorporated had motive
to kill Steven Horowitz.

16:50.340 --> 16:52.160
Steven Horowitz
was a debt merchant.

16:52.210 --> 16:53.768
A what now?

16:53.810 --> 16:57.678
Someone somewhere buys,
let's say, a Jet Ski on credit.

16:57.710 --> 16:59.075
Then she loses her job

16:59.110 --> 17:00.771
and she stops paying.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.173
Another person dislikes
the curvature of his buttocks,

17:02.220 --> 17:03.619
so he splurges on a set
of implants.

17:03.650 --> 17:05.743
Another soul eyes an Italian
supercar and thinks,

17:05.790 --> 17:07.417
"Why not me?"

17:07.460 --> 17:08.779
People buy things
they can't afford.

17:08.820 --> 17:09.752
I'm aware of the concept.

17:09.790 --> 17:11.655
Many, many people.

17:11.690 --> 17:14.090
Much of it is frivolous,
some of it is not.

17:14.130 --> 17:16.598
But every such purchase flows
into a massive ocean

17:16.630 --> 17:17.790
of consumer debt.

17:17.830 --> 17:19.525
In this country alone,
it adds up

17:19.570 --> 17:21.663
to $2.4 trillion,

17:21.700 --> 17:24.305
most of it owed _
to credit card companies.

17:24.340 --> 17:26.535
Horowitz did not work
for a credit card company.

17:26.570 --> 17:30.108
True, but such corporations
have a policy of giving up

17:30.150 --> 17:32.846
on trying to collect unpaid debt
after 180 days.

17:32.880 --> 17:35.678
Someone's decided it's just
not worth the effort.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.187
So they sell it on.

17:37.220 --> 17:39.108
They sell the debt?

17:39.150 --> 17:40.686
To who?

17:40.720 --> 17:42.813
Why would anyone buy
an unpaid bill?

17:42.860 --> 17:45.351
Because you can get it
at a steep discount.

17:45.390 --> 17:48.689
Let's say you purchase
$10,000 worth of debt

17:48.730 --> 17:50.527
for $1,000.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.629
You're then able_to harass
or othermse

17:52.670 --> 17:55.559
wring $5,000 out
of your unfortunate creditees.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.794
You've then made...

17:56.840 --> 17:58.330
$4,000.

17:58.370 --> 17:59.837
As a way to make a living,

17:59.870 --> 18:01.474
it's more than a bit dclass,

18:01.510 --> 18:03.546
which is why Steven
kept it hidden from his wife.

18:03.580 --> 18:05.104
But it can also be
very lucrative,

18:05.150 --> 18:06.708
which is why he was doing it
in the first place.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.615
(phone chimes)
Well, we're gonna need
a phone bank

18:08.650 --> 18:10.481
of our own just to sort
through all these people.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.647
Actually, we're going
to the precinct.

18:12.690 --> 18:15.716
I asked Detective Bell
to sort through the W-ZS

18:15.760 --> 18:17.284
from Steven's company.

18:17.330 --> 18:20.390
He's bringing in an employee
named Eduardo Pea.

18:20.430 --> 18:23.228
Well, any one of those people
on the wall

18:23.270 --> 18:24.589
had motive to want Steven gone.

18:24.630 --> 18:25.790
And I wouldn't rule them out,

18:25.830 --> 18:27.593
but the debt collection industry

18:27.640 --> 18:30.438
is notorious for hiring convicts
and recent parolees.

18:30.470 --> 18:32.233
I think it's equally likely
that Steven ran afoul

18:32.270 --> 18:33.635
of one of his shadowy
new associates.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.433
Someone like Eduardo Pea.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.777
The man does have a history
of incarceration

18:37.810 --> 18:38.799
and violent assault.

18:45.550 --> 18:47.916
Copies of the W-2 forms
from SMH Incorporated.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.609
Bell hasn't arrived
with Mr. Pea yet,

18:49.660 --> 18:51.150
(phone chimes)
so I thought we could look

18:51.190 --> 18:52.657
through them while we wait
and see

18:52.690 --> 18:53.850
if there's anything untoward.

18:59.530 --> 19:01.168
Why did you lie?

19:01.200 --> 19:02.531
What?

19:02.570 --> 19:04.401
That's an Argentinian
steakhouse.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.907
It's an established fact that
you abhor chimichurri sauce.

19:05.940 --> 19:08.374
First of all,
don't read over my shoulder.

19:08.410 --> 19:10.173
And it wasn't a lie.
I'm being polite.

19:10.210 --> 19:11.575
We're having dinner
with Andrew's father tonight.

19:11.610 --> 19:12.872
He probably picked the place.

19:12.910 --> 19:14.411
I'm not gonna say
I won't go there.

19:14.450 --> 19:16.270
Meeting the parents.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.880
That's an important milestone in
your romantic passion play.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.456
No, I'm not meeting his parents.
I'm having dinner

19:20.490 --> 19:21.787
with his father.
It's no big deal.

19:21.820 --> 19:23.253
Then why is it making
you so tense?

19:23.290 --> 19:24.552
I'm not tense about the meal.
I'm tense

19:24.590 --> 19:25.727
about you grilling me about it.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.728
No.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.598
Oh, Marcus is here.

19:30.630 --> 19:32.928
Thank God.

19:32.970 --> 19:35.291
Steven and I worked
our first debt package together

19:35.340 --> 19:37.638
a few months ago.

19:37.670 --> 19:39.638
It was his first time.

19:39.670 --> 19:41.831
I kind of showed
him the ropes.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.871
And you were working
on another project together,

19:43.910 --> 19:45.207
weren't you?

19:45.250 --> 19:46.774
Out in Long Island City?

19:46.810 --> 19:48.778
Steven got tipped
to a big package.

19:48.820 --> 19:51.209
He called it the Mother Lode.

19:51.250 --> 19:52.945
Millions and millions' worth
of debt

19:52.990 --> 19:54.878
that he picked up on the cheap.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.252
How many millions?
I don't know.

19:57.290 --> 19:59.724
Steven never showed me
the whole list.

19:59.760 --> 20:02.456
He'd just give us names
to call every day.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.718
Why were your
offices shut down?

20:04.770 --> 20:06.761
I don't
really know.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.394
Sometimes if Steven
had his hooks into someone

20:09.440 --> 20:11.965
who owed big money
and they lived nearby,

20:12.010 --> 20:13.568
he'd drive out
to see him,

20:13.610 --> 20:14.975
try to collect
in person.

20:15.010 --> 20:17.945
He went out on one
of those errands last week,

20:17.980 --> 20:20.813
came back,
told us all to go home.

20:20.850 --> 20:21.976
What happened?

20:22.020 --> 20:24.739
Who did he see?
No idea.

20:24.790 --> 20:27.258
He just said we were done
collecting on the package--

20:27.290 --> 20:29.850
which was ridiculous, 'cause
we hadn't even called a third

20:29.890 --> 20:32.586
of the names yet.
How do you know that?

20:32.630 --> 20:34.848
Thought you never
saw the whole list.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.691
Just a guess.

20:38.730 --> 20:39.822
He's lying.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.531
Badly.

20:41.570 --> 20:42.992
Who are you calling?

20:43.040 --> 20:46.009
The phone company.
I'm gonna pretend
to be Mr. Pea.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.474
BELL:
You must have been pretty upset,

20:48.510 --> 20:50.842
losing a job
out of nowhere like that.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.769
I was wondering when
you were gonna get to that.

20:53.820 --> 20:56.015
You think
I killed Steven, right?

20:56.050 --> 20:57.847
Makes sense.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.949
He fired me.

20:59.990 --> 21:02.015
I've got a rap sheet.

21:02.060 --> 21:04.358
He died, what,
a couple days ago?

21:04.390 --> 21:05.687
That's right.

21:05.730 --> 21:08.449
Steven let everybody go
last week.

21:10.630 --> 21:12.769
Got back
last night.

21:12.800 --> 21:15.633
What were you doing there?
Nephew's
birthday party.

21:15.670 --> 21:18.002
I'll show you the travel
receipts if you want.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.928
HOLMES (over intercom):
He might not have killed
Steven Horowitz,

21:19.970 --> 21:21.403
but he's lying about one thing.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.032
He has the complete
list of debts.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.479
He stole it.

21:24.510 --> 21:26.944
Who's that?

21:26.980 --> 21:29.574
Mr. Pea just installed 14 new
phone lines at his apartment.

21:29.620 --> 21:31.941
He's opening
a boiler room of his own.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.753
Is that true?

21:33.790 --> 21:35.314
If we look around your place,

21:35.360 --> 21:37.453
are we gonna find
Steven's list of debtors?

21:37.490 --> 21:40.323
BELL:
If we do, that's criminal
possession of stolen property.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.794
That's a felony charge
and a parole violation.

21:42.830 --> 21:45.060
Now, of course,
if your alibi checks out,

21:45.100 --> 21:46.920
you give us the list
voluntarily...

21:46.970 --> 21:49.063
we might be able to work
something out with your P.O.

21:51.370 --> 21:53.338
Presenting
the Mother Lode.

21:53.380 --> 21:54.802
There looks,
at first glance,

21:54.840 --> 21:57.673
to be around $20 million worth
of unpaid bills.

21:57.710 --> 21:59.109
So_ what are we
looking for in here?

21:59.150 --> 22:00.777
Any large amounts

22:00.820 --> 22:03.584
owed by residents of
Naugatuck, Connecticut.

22:03.620 --> 22:06.043
We have Steven's
EZ Pass records

22:06.090 --> 22:07.682
and cell phone
tower pings

22:07.720 --> 22:08.914
from a rural route
in Naugatuck

22:08.960 --> 22:09.984
shortly before
his disappearance.

22:10.020 --> 22:11.829
He had no normal
busmess there,

22:11.860 --> 22:13.020
so perhaps he was looking
for one of his debtors.

22:13.060 --> 22:14.698
So you want to find out

22:14.730 --> 22:16.721
what happened
in that face-to-face visit.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.068
Everything was proceeding
quite normally

22:18.100 --> 22:19.419
up to that point,

22:19.470 --> 22:21.097
so we need to learn
what scared Steven

22:21.140 --> 22:23.608
into closing
his business.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.062
You really mustn't
feel badly

22:25.110 --> 22:26.407
about not wanting to
meet Andrew's parents.

22:26.440 --> 22:27.668
The man's always
been something of

22:27.710 --> 22:28.904
a placeholder
for you.

22:28.940 --> 22:30.544
"Placeholder"?
I never said that.

22:30.580 --> 22:32.400
You've also, in all
the time you've dated,

22:32.450 --> 22:33.678
never displayed even a
hint of the intoxication

22:33.720 --> 22:34.914
which accompanies
new love.

22:34.950 --> 22:37.418
The man is back
permanently,

22:37.450 --> 22:38.712
seeking a modest escalation
of the relationship,

22:38.750 --> 22:39.944
and you're forced
to confront

22:39.990 --> 22:41.059
your lack of passion
for the man.

22:41.090 --> 22:42.853
That's a line of
thinking which leads

22:42.890 --> 22:43.982
inevitably
to a breakup.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.622
I don't want
to break up with Andrew.

22:45.660 --> 22:47.127
We're just sort of starting out.

22:47.160 --> 22:48.627
If you don't want
to break up with him,

22:48.660 --> 22:50.093
then why does the idea
of meeting his parents

22:50.130 --> 22:52.018
fill you with a
nameless dread?

22:52.070 --> 22:54.436
(sighs)
I...
Don't answer
that right away.

22:54.470 --> 22:55.892
Actually, we'll have
plenty of time to think,

22:55.940 --> 22:57.635
'cause we're driving
to Connecticut.

22:57.670 --> 23:00.036
You found someone.
HOLMES:
Owen Downey.

23:00.070 --> 23:02.106
According to this list,
he has accumulated

23:02.140 --> 23:05.541
several hundred thousand
dollars' worth of debt.

23:05.580 --> 23:08.674
Owen Downey has
a felony record,

23:08.720 --> 23:10.017
so if he doesn't
answer the door...

23:10.050 --> 23:12.109
We don't pick the lock.
Uh-uh.

23:12.150 --> 23:14.983
(doorbell rings)

23:15.020 --> 23:16.009
Hello.

23:16.060 --> 23:17.482
Good afternoon.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.122
We're consultants
with the NYPD.

23:19.160 --> 23:20.650
We'd like to see
Owen Downey.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.122
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.718
Owen's having his treatment
right now.

23:23.770 --> 23:24.998
WATSON:
We just have a few

23:25.030 --> 23:26.122
questions for him.

23:26.170 --> 23:27.728
It's kind of been
a long drive.

23:27.770 --> 23:28.896
WOMAN:
Well, if you're willing to wait,

23:28.940 --> 23:30.567
you can talk to him in a minute,

23:30.610 --> 23:33.579
but right now
Owen isn't saying anything.

23:33.610 --> 23:36.033
(pressurized air hissing)

23:38.510 --> 23:41.070
I don't think that man's
bludgeoned anyone recently.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.576
What's his diagnosis?

23:42.620 --> 23:44.019
Emphysema.

23:44.050 --> 23:46.541
Owen thinks he picked it
up working construction,

23:46.590 --> 23:49.081
but he never got any
money out of the company.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.656
I'm Owen's aunt.

23:50.690 --> 23:53.022
I work at a
hospital in town.

23:53.060 --> 23:54.925
I come by whenever I can,

23:54.960 --> 23:56.894
get him whatever medicine
I can get my hands on.

23:56.930 --> 23:58.693
During your visits,
have you ever seen this man?

23:58.730 --> 23:59.924
Sure.

23:59.970 --> 24:01.562
Steven.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.636
He's been out here a few times.

24:03.670 --> 24:05.103
Is he okay?

24:05.140 --> 24:06.061
I'm afraid not.

24:06.110 --> 24:07.771
He was murdered.

24:07.810 --> 24:10.131
Oh, my goodness.

24:10.180 --> 24:12.148
I'm so sorry
to hear that.

24:12.180 --> 24:14.614
I know Steven was struggling
to find his way,

24:14.650 --> 24:16.208
but he was a good man.

24:16.250 --> 24:19.481
A good man? He was trying to
collect money from your nephew.

24:19.520 --> 24:20.919
At first.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.588
Then he talked to Owen
for a while.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.781
The second time I saw him here,
he brought groceries.

24:26.830 --> 24:28.695
Then last week,
he told Owen

24:28.730 --> 24:30.618
he didn't owe him
anything anymore.

24:30.670 --> 24:31.819
Really?

24:31.870 --> 24:33.531
It was like a miracle.

24:33.570 --> 24:35.697
Steven said he couldn't live
with what he was doing,

24:35.740 --> 24:37.230
he couldn't bleed money
out of people

24:37.270 --> 24:38.828
who were down
on their luck anymore.

24:38.870 --> 24:40.929
He was forgiving
Owen's debt.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.278
Maybe that's why
he closed the business.

24:43.310 --> 24:45.039
He wasn't just
absolving Owen's debt,

24:45.080 --> 24:47.844
he was doing it
for everyone in that file.

24:47.880 --> 24:49.245
(beeping)
Excuse me.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.815
Steven Horowitz may
not have been killed

24:52.850 --> 24:54.613
because he was a debt collector,

24:54.660 --> 24:57.254
he may have been killed
because he was a debt forgiver.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.889
So Steven Horowitz was what,
some kind of Robin Hood?

25:07.940 --> 25:10.568
Mm, the analogy is not perfect,

25:10.610 --> 25:12.566
but in a _manner
of speaking, yes.

25:12.610 --> 25:15.078
He didn't set out to forgive
a massive parcel of debt.

25:15.110 --> 25:17.772
He had every intention of
collecting on the Mother Lode

25:17.810 --> 25:20.074
but somewhere along the way
had an epiphany.

25:20.110 --> 25:22.772
So it's kind of like the Grinch
giving back Christmas.

25:22.820 --> 25:24.549
Well, good on Steven.
What has this

25:24.590 --> 25:25.989
got to do with
his murder?

25:26.020 --> 25:27.681
An entirely pertinent question.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.608
Before he could process
the paperwork

25:29.660 --> 25:31.059
which would
actually have registered

25:31.090 --> 25:33.081
the debt as settled,
Steven was murdered.

25:33.130 --> 25:35.325
You think someone_ wanted
to stop him from d0ing that?

25:35.360 --> 25:37.897
I think Steven had very little
in the way of savings.

25:37.930 --> 25:39.761
Someone would
have alerted him

25:39.800 --> 25:41.563
to the existence
of the Mother Lode.

25:41.600 --> 25:43.636
It was a package which,
if worked properly,

25:43.670 --> 25:45.069
could set him up for life.

25:45.110 --> 25:47.772
But it would cost
millions of dollars to purchase.

25:47.810 --> 25:49.937
So he had investors?
And who
purchases shares

25:49.980 --> 25:52.904
in large packets of unpaid debt?

25:52.950 --> 25:54.747
A rogues' gallery.

25:54.780 --> 25:56.077
Those who spend
their lives

25:56.120 --> 25:58.645
in the twilight between
the legal and the criminal.

25:58.690 --> 26:00.112
I give you...

26:00.150 --> 26:03.779
the principal investors
in SMH Incorporated.

26:03.830 --> 26:05.855
Is that Sam Gianini?

26:05.890 --> 26:08.199
HOLMES:
The reputed head of what is left
of the city's crime family

26:08.230 --> 26:09.720
invested through
a shell corporation

26:09.760 --> 26:10.829
named after his niece.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.861
Grace Yee,

26:12.900 --> 26:14.094
doyenne of Brooklyn's
offtrack betting economy;

26:14.140 --> 26:16.700
Walker Tolan,
curator of sex clubs

26:16.740 --> 26:18.037
which connect money
to Wall Street

26:18.070 --> 26:19.662
with pliable
young men and women...

26:19.710 --> 26:21.678
I would go on,
but you get the picture--

26:21.710 --> 26:24.099
there's_ no_ one here
you would inVIte to high tea.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.710
No one you'd want to stiff
on their seed money, either.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.638
HOLMES: Precisely.
Steven Horowitz's

26:28.680 --> 26:31.046
spiritual awakening
had the unhappy side effect

26:31.090 --> 26:33.979
of enraging a cross-section
of blackguards and highwaymen.

26:34.020 --> 26:37.183
It's our job to figure out
which one of them killed him.

26:37.220 --> 26:40.018
Well, with that group, would've
been a race to the finish line.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.154
So, obviously I did not become

26:43.200 --> 26:45.020
a sober companion
to be a detective.

26:45.070 --> 26:47.061
I didn't even know
I wanted to be a detective

26:47.100 --> 26:48.931
until I actually
started doing it. I mean,

26:48.970 --> 26:51.234
I resisted it for a long time,
but I'm really glad

26:51.270 --> 26:52.862
I made the switch.

26:52.910 --> 26:54.832
So...

26:54.880 --> 26:56.029
surgeon...

26:56.080 --> 26:57.399
sober companion...

26:57.440 --> 26:59.704
detective.
I-I know _it sounds
meandering when

26:59.750 --> 27:03.277
I describe it, but
I promise you it all
felt very organic while

27:03.320 --> 27:05.743
it was actually happening.
That's a rather
perfect description

27:05.790 --> 27:07.280
of most people's lives.

27:07.320 --> 27:10.084
I find your story inspiring,
actually.

27:10.120 --> 27:13.954
Wow. I think my mother would
say "flighty," but... thanks.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.149
Well, of course she would.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.020
We worry about our children.

27:17.060 --> 27:19.699
That never goes away.
But to me,

27:19.730 --> 27:21.869
it sounds like
you found your passion.

27:21.900 --> 27:25.131
You were open to it
when it presented itself;
you didn't settle.

27:25.170 --> 27:28.799
It's exactly the sense of
adventure Andrew's mother and I

27:28.840 --> 27:30.671
_ tried to foster
in our own children.

27:30.710 --> 27:33.440
You guys enrolled me
in a programming class
in third grade.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.448
And look
at you now.

27:35.480 --> 27:39.211
I'm sorry it's taken so long
for us to get together.

27:39.250 --> 27:41.059
You're remarkable.

27:41.090 --> 27:42.352
*

27:42.390 --> 27:44.051
(laughs softly)

27:46.830 --> 27:48.297
(key clacking in lock)

27:48.330 --> 27:49.354
(door creaks open)

27:49.400 --> 27:51.197
(door closes)

27:51.230 --> 27:52.959
Watson, what are
you doing here?

27:53.000 --> 27:54.968
Well, I just came here
to punch you.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.139
(grunts)

27:57.170 --> 27:59.035
What was that for?

27:59.070 --> 28:00.162
I hate it when you're right.

28:00.210 --> 28:02.178
Is this about your dinner?

28:02.210 --> 28:04.201
It was totally
a Meet the Parents thing.

28:04.250 --> 28:07.071
There really is no version
of meeting someone's parents

28:07.110 --> 28:09.249
that doesn't involve
actually meeting their parents.

28:09.280 --> 28:10.781
You know what I mean.
And Andrew's father

28:10.820 --> 28:12.287
was so... amazing--
he was warm and welcoming.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.379
He was obviously so thrilled
that I was dating his son.

28:14.420 --> 28:18.129
I mean, it went about as well
as you could possibly imagine.
And yet...

28:18.160 --> 28:20.799
I didn't want any of it.

28:20.830 --> 28:22.821
I just didn't
feel comfortable.

28:22.860 --> 28:24.225
I mean, Andrew is smart,
he's kind,

28:24.270 --> 28:25.999
he doesn't dress like
a high school student

28:26.030 --> 28:28.260
who just got expelled.
What is wrong with me?

28:28.300 --> 28:30.268
I'm not feeling anything
I'm supposed to be feeling.

28:30.300 --> 28:32.939
I'm an expert in many things,
but love is not one of them.

28:32.970 --> 28:34.801
I do know, however,
it cannot be reduced

28:34.840 --> 28:36.239
to a checklist of traits.

28:36.280 --> 28:38.009
You know, you might
have to accept

28:38.050 --> 28:41.110
the fact that whatever your
relationship with Andrew means,

28:41.150 --> 28:43.846
you just don't want it.

28:43.890 --> 28:46.142
Then what do I want?

28:46.190 --> 28:47.851
I don't know.

28:47.890 --> 28:50.108
While you're sorting that out,
you might inadvertently

28:50.160 --> 28:52.856
be treating a kind man...
rather shabbily.

28:54.260 --> 28:55.989
(groans)

28:57.360 --> 28:59.328
Well, I-I know
what has to happen.

28:59.370 --> 29:01.167
What are you up to, anyway?

29:01.200 --> 29:02.462
Why-why are you
making Clyde paint?

29:02.500 --> 29:04.468
HOLMES: I'm not forcing him
to do anything.

29:04.510 --> 29:06.307
He enjoys it.

29:06.340 --> 29:09.207
It's quite soothing to watch...

29:09.240 --> 29:11.845
while I wait to be humiliated.

29:11.880 --> 29:15.338
When we parted company, we were
assuming that Steven Horowitz

29:15.380 --> 29:17.314
was murdered
by one of his investors.

29:17.350 --> 29:19.841
Now, cursory investigation
has revealed that to be false.

29:19.890 --> 29:22.188
Steven, it turns out,
worked enough of the Mother Lode

29:22.220 --> 29:23.517
to pay off his investors

29:23.560 --> 29:25.425
before he had his
change of heart.

29:25.460 --> 29:27.792
So if it wasn't one of them...

29:27.830 --> 29:29.297
We are quite without suspect.

29:29.330 --> 29:31.264
In an effort to dredge one up,

29:31.300 --> 29:33.268
I've been thinking
about the nature of debt.

29:33.300 --> 29:34.790
It is, first
and foremost,

29:34.840 --> 29:37.400
leverage that one person
holds over another.

29:37.440 --> 29:39.499
Okay.
Given that,

29:39.540 --> 29:41.906
I've been wondering
if perhaps our killer had reason

29:41.940 --> 29:43.430
to want someone
in that portfolio--

29:43.480 --> 29:45.869
or someones-- to stay in debt.

29:45.910 --> 29:47.946
Before he had his
change of heart,

29:47.980 --> 29:49.971
Steven drove all the way
out to Connecticut

29:50.020 --> 29:52.045
to hound one man--
Owen Downey.

29:52.090 --> 29:54.285
Now, there are other people
listed on the Mother Lode

29:54.320 --> 29:56.185
who owed more money
and lived nearby.

29:56.220 --> 29:57.414
Steven focused on Owen.

29:57.460 --> 29:59.189
Why?

30:00.630 --> 30:02.222
Upon revisiting Owen,

30:02.260 --> 30:03.591
_I discovered _
something qUIte interesting

30:03.630 --> 30:06.292
about his community--
all of the properties

30:06.330 --> 30:09.595
within a five-mile radius
of... Owen's house

30:09.640 --> 30:11.961
were purchased
over the last two years

30:12.010 --> 30:15.173
by the same property developer:
Jay Stern Investments.

30:15.210 --> 30:17.098
For what?
Don't know.

30:17.140 --> 30:18.277
Hasn't been made public yet.

30:18.310 --> 30:20.141
I've asked our friends
at Everyone

30:20.180 --> 30:22.171
to have a look behind Stern
Investments' firewalls

30:22.220 --> 30:24.415
and perhaps shed some light
on the matter.

30:24.450 --> 30:27.180
They're presently deciding
what price they wish to extract.

30:27.220 --> 30:29.609
Which is why you're
waiting to be humiliated.

30:29.660 --> 30:31.981
(computer chimes)
I believe that
might be them now.

30:34.060 --> 30:36.119
(taps keyboard)

30:38.230 --> 30:39.629
Ha!

30:39.670 --> 30:41.297
Brilliant.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.228
Yes. They are no doubt
congratulating themselves

30:43.270 --> 30:45.636
on having erected
their most fiendish
obstacle yet.

30:45.670 --> 30:48.002
Well, yeah, they want
a Super Bowl ring.

30:48.040 --> 30:49.632
The proverbial
piece of cake.

30:49.680 --> 30:52.444
I'll simply call Phillip
and the matter will be
well in hand.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.345
Phillip? Phil Simms?
I mean, I know you two

30:54.380 --> 30:56.416
have worked together
or something, but do
you really think

30:56.450 --> 30:58.884
he's just gonna
give you one of his
Super Bowl rings?

30:58.920 --> 31:01.650
You've got no idea
what the man owes me.

31:01.690 --> 31:04.124
(line ringing)

31:07.930 --> 31:09.056
Morning.

31:09.100 --> 31:10.965
Repast. Couture.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.538
We're going to see
the board of directors
at Stern Investments.

31:14.570 --> 31:17.494
(yawns) I didn't know
I had any clothes left here.

31:17.540 --> 31:19.337
You didn't.
I purchased those.

31:19.370 --> 31:22.430
We frequently work late nights,
so I imagined they'd be of use.

31:22.480 --> 31:24.072
Hope they're
to your liking.

31:24.110 --> 31:26.908
Oh. It's great, actually.
Thanks.

31:26.950 --> 31:28.941
Uh, why are we going
to Stern Investments?

31:28.980 --> 31:30.447
Phillip squared
his account with me,

31:30.480 --> 31:32.209
and Everyone got their ring.

31:32.250 --> 31:34.957
They spent quite a bit
of time on Stern's servers.

31:34.990 --> 31:36.514
I learned some interesting
details about the sex lives

31:36.560 --> 31:38.528
of some of the board members.
I also determined

31:38.560 --> 31:41.290
they're planning to build
a ski resort in Connecticut.

31:41.330 --> 31:43.298
Naugatuck,
to be exact.

31:43.330 --> 31:46.527
Which is why
they're buying up the land.
At the moment,

31:46.570 --> 31:48.367
the details of the project are
known only to the six members

31:48.400 --> 31:50.595
of Stern's board and their CEO.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.699
They'd like to unveil the plans
next week.

31:52.740 --> 31:55.709
Only there's a problem:
Owen Downey's house sits right

31:55.740 --> 31:57.332
in the middle of their proposed

31:57.380 --> 31:59.177
mountain lodge.
He's a holdout.

31:59.210 --> 32:00.404
Hmm.

32:00.450 --> 32:02.418
Mr. Downey
is understandably unwilling

32:02.450 --> 32:04.441
to uproot his life
in his current condition.

32:04.490 --> 32:06.685
Stern thinks they'll be able
to force a sale,

32:06.720 --> 32:08.688
since Owen will not be able
to repay his medical debts

32:08.720 --> 32:10.654
_ unless h_e_sel|s
his last remaining asset,

32:10.690 --> 32:14.228
his home.
But if Steven forgave
Owen's debt...

32:14.260 --> 32:15.454
There'd be no need to sell.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.695
The entire resort
would be imperiled.

32:17.730 --> 32:20.392
Only six people knew about this?

32:20.430 --> 32:22.159
Seven, including the CEO.

32:22.200 --> 32:24.407
I do like a nice tidy pool
of suspects.

32:24.440 --> 32:27.409
MAN:
We've got to be able to line up

32:27.440 --> 32:28.702
everybody in town, I mean,
shoulder to shoulder,

32:28.740 --> 32:31.004
or we're gonna look

32:31.050 --> 32:33.177
awfully weak in
this next meeting.
Morning, ladies and gentlemen.

32:33.210 --> 32:35.041
What_the hell
is gomg on?
I'm sorry, sir.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.116
I couldn't stop them.
HOLMES:
Apologies for the interruption,

32:37.150 --> 32:39.118
but cold logic dictates
that one of you

32:39.150 --> 32:41.550
is likely a killer.
My colleague and I are in

32:41.590 --> 32:43.649
an on-again, off-again
relationship with the NYPD.

32:43.690 --> 32:45.487
We thought we'd take a look
at you all in one place

32:45.530 --> 32:47.486
and see if anyone pops out.
This is insane.

32:47.530 --> 32:49.259
What are you even
talking about?

32:49.300 --> 32:51.723
Look, you can't barge in here.
Get out.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.567
Call our attorneys.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.967
Sherlock.

32:58.610 --> 33:01.431
My apologies.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.539
On second thoughts,
it's distinctly possible

33:03.580 --> 33:05.400
there is no killer
in this room.

33:05.450 --> 33:07.975
One of you, however,
does like to be spanked.

33:09.580 --> 33:11.241
Carry on!

33:13.190 --> 33:14.555
What happened in there?
I thought you were sure

33:14.590 --> 33:16.057
one of them did it.
(sighs)

33:16.090 --> 33:17.455
Of the seven people
in that room,

33:17.490 --> 33:19.481
three of them are women
of small stature.

33:19.530 --> 33:21.327
One was a geriatric,
and one was trying to hide

33:21.360 --> 33:23.555
the fact that he's nearly blind
from the rest of his colleagues.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.465
And one, whose e-mails
I happen to have read,

33:25.500 --> 33:28.060
was spending his evening
in the company of his dominatrix

33:28.100 --> 33:30.068
at the time
that Steven Horowitz was killed.

33:30.100 --> 33:32.500
The CEO was the only one
who could have overpowered

33:32.540 --> 33:34.508
and bludgeoned a grown man,
and he had the remnants

33:34.540 --> 33:36.201
of a peeling sunburn
at the edges of his hairline.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.208
We'll confirm it,
but I think he was on holiday

33:38.250 --> 33:40.673
at the time of the murder.
Any one of them
could have hired a killer.

33:40.710 --> 33:42.371
Unlikely.

33:42.420 --> 33:43.717
Professional killers tend
to execute people

33:43.750 --> 33:45.581
in professional fashion.
They don't blunder about

33:45.620 --> 33:46.814
with ﬁre extinguishers.

33:46.850 --> 33:48.579
So in other words,
we're nowhere.

33:48.620 --> 33:50.178
Quite the contrary.

33:50.220 --> 33:52.620
I have a very good idea
who killed Steven Horowitz.

33:59.570 --> 34:02.368
Sorry, who are you here
to meet with?
Oh, no,

34:02.400 --> 34:04.163
we're not_ here to meet
anyone. We just came to look

34:04.210 --> 34:05.734
at one of your partners,
uh, Coleman Brown.

34:05.770 --> 34:09.479
Um, th-these are on, uh,
public display, are they not?

34:09.510 --> 34:12.149
I guess.
Great. Thanks.

34:16.350 --> 34:18.545
When we were expelled
from Stern Investments,

34:18.590 --> 34:21.081
their CEO gave me the card
of their attorney.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.714
Did you know that Stern
Investments is represented by...

34:23.760 --> 34:25.159
Dorchester-Reid?

34:25.190 --> 34:27.488
So someone from Steven's

34:27.530 --> 34:29.327
old law firm
represents the people

34:29.360 --> 34:32.124
who want to build a ski resort
on Owen Downey's property.

34:32.170 --> 34:34.491
An attorney who, if worth
his salt as a negotiator,

34:34.540 --> 34:36.496
stands to earn _
a masswe commi55ion

34:36.540 --> 34:38.758
should the resort
become a reality.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.607
Coleman Brown.

34:40.640 --> 34:42.676
I did a little research
on the way over here.

34:42.710 --> 34:45.304
Coleman and Steven
were both members

34:45.350 --> 34:46.772
of the Braebury Country Club.

34:46.810 --> 34:49.313
Apparently they routinely
played golf together.

34:49.350 --> 34:52.148
I suspect it was Coleman Brown
who made Steven aware

34:52.190 --> 34:53.509
of the Mother Lode
in the first place.

34:53.550 --> 34:55.780
So this guy points Steven
at Owen.

34:55.820 --> 34:58.380
But if Steven forgave
Owen's debt

34:58.430 --> 35:01.149
instead of breathing down his
neck until he sold his house...

35:01.200 --> 35:03.350
Coleman Brown
would lose millions.

35:04.630 --> 35:05.824
Excuse me.

35:05.870 --> 35:07.269
Mr. Brown.

35:07.300 --> 35:08.699
It's a very good likeness, yes.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.628
A bit flattering
in the cheekbones

35:10.670 --> 35:11.807
but it's good.
Our receptionist said

35:11.840 --> 35:14.377
there were two people here
to look at a painting of me.

35:14.410 --> 35:15.604
Can I help you with something?

35:15.640 --> 35:16.902
Oh, no. Not at the moment.

35:16.940 --> 35:19.272
Thank you, though.

35:23.350 --> 35:25.784
So now what?

35:25.820 --> 35:28.653
Now_we build a case
against Mr. Brown.

35:37.930 --> 35:41.491
Did you really have to
bring that back here?

35:41.540 --> 35:43.599
I hardly think
the painting will be missed.

35:43.640 --> 35:46.609
Once we prove that Coleman Brown
is a cold-blooded murderer,

35:46.640 --> 35:48.437
they'll probably take it down
anyway.

35:48.480 --> 35:52.439
Besides, there's something
about his smug visage

35:52.480 --> 35:54.744
I find highly motivating.

35:54.780 --> 35:57.340
If you're so motivated, how come
we haven't connected him

35:57.380 --> 35:58.916
to the murder yet?
I suspect

35:58.950 --> 36:01.453
it has to do with a paucity
of physical evidence.

36:04.290 --> 36:05.826
WATSON:
I don't care if you're motivated

36:05.860 --> 36:07.828
by him or not.
I feel like he's staring at me.

36:07.860 --> 36:09.657
I'm taking it down.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.976
In this painting,
Mr. Brown is wearing

36:22.010 --> 36:23.568
a pair of horn-rimmed glasses.

36:23.610 --> 36:25.248
If you Google him,

36:25.280 --> 36:27.578
he's wearing the same pair
in all of his pictures.

36:27.610 --> 36:28.747
When we met him today...

36:28.780 --> 36:30.714
HOLMES:
He was wearing rimless frames.

36:30.750 --> 36:33.241
Could be he has more
than one pair of glasses.

36:33.290 --> 36:34.757
WATSON:
Could be.

36:34.790 --> 36:37.884
Or maybe there's some
physical evidence after all.

36:39.930 --> 36:42.649
Mr. Brown.
Thanks for coming down.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.998
Whatever.
Let's make this fast.

36:45.030 --> 36:48.397
We just have a few questions.
Right this way.

36:49.970 --> 36:51.938
Oh, seriously?

36:51.970 --> 36:53.733
These two?
They stole

36:53.770 --> 36:55.579
a portrait worth
thousands of dollars

36:55.610 --> 36:57.271
from my office
yesterday.

36:57.310 --> 37:00.245
GREGSON:
Uh, well, we'll, uh,

37:00.280 --> 37:01.645
sort that_ out
in a bit.

37:01.680 --> 37:04.717
First, uh,
have a seat.

37:04.750 --> 37:06.809
We wanted to talk
to you about...

37:06.850 --> 37:08.659
Steven Horowitz.

37:08.690 --> 37:10.612
Guy who used to
work at my firm?

37:10.660 --> 37:12.025
HOLMES:
We know
that you alerted Steven

37:12.060 --> 37:13.789
to a package of debt
which contained

37:13.830 --> 37:15.798
Owen Downey's medical bills.

37:15.830 --> 37:18.663
We also know that you stood
to earn millions of dollars

37:18.700 --> 37:20.668
if Stern Investments
could compel Mr. Downey

37:20.700 --> 37:21.792
to sell his home.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.728
Unfortunately,

37:23.770 --> 37:26.705
your debt collector had
a sentimental streak.

37:26.740 --> 37:29.038
And when Steven told you he
planned to forgive Owen's debt

37:29.080 --> 37:30.877
along with everyone else's,
you couldn't abide that,

37:30.910 --> 37:33.504
could you? You
went to his office

37:33.550 --> 37:34.812
and you confronted him.

37:34.850 --> 37:36.977
And then you killed him.

37:37.020 --> 37:40.387
That's ridiculous. I've never
even set foot in his office.

37:40.420 --> 37:43.719
Are you sure about that?
Yes, I'm sure.
I'm getting an attorney.

37:43.760 --> 37:46.524
That's a good idea.
'Cause you're gonna need one.

37:46.560 --> 37:48.357
You recently bought a new pair
of glasses, didn't you?

37:48.400 --> 37:49.890
So?

37:49.930 --> 37:52.797
So you needed to buy a new pair
of glasses because you shattered

37:52.830 --> 37:56.539
your old ones
when you attacked Mr. Horowitz.

37:56.570 --> 37:57.969
We picked through the
evidence again last night.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.809
Most of what we found
was shattered glass

37:59.840 --> 38:02.536
from the fire extinguisher box.
But some of it

38:02.580 --> 38:04.844
was polycarbonate.

38:04.880 --> 38:07.348
Like you'd find
from a pair of glasses.

38:07.380 --> 38:08.779
HOLMES:
When we put those pieces
together,

38:08.820 --> 38:11.789
a fingerprint very courteously
assembled itself

38:11.820 --> 38:14.015
on the partially
reconstituted lens.

38:15.820 --> 38:17.651
Would you like to guess
whose it was?

38:17.690 --> 38:18.987
What were you
saying before

38:19.030 --> 38:21.089
about never having set foot
in his office?

38:21.130 --> 38:26.818
I'm not saying anything else
without my attorney present.

38:28.800 --> 38:32.736
You have exactly
one bargaining chip left.

38:32.770 --> 38:35.876
The location
of Steven Horowitz's body.

38:37.910 --> 38:39.707
We'll go ahead
and call your attorney

38:39.750 --> 38:41.479
right after we get done

38:41.520 --> 38:43.476
reading you
your rights.

38:43.520 --> 38:46.887
(handcuffs rattling)

38:51.160 --> 38:52.957
What is that?

38:52.990 --> 38:55.026
That, madam, is your property.

38:55.060 --> 38:59.497
You're Steven Horowitz's
next of kin, so...

38:59.530 --> 39:01.896
you rightfully inherit ownership
of the debt he was collecting

39:01.940 --> 39:04.033
in order _to maintain
the family lifestyle.

39:04.070 --> 39:08.803
Steven could have told me
he was fired.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.035
My God.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.877
What happened to us?

39:12.910 --> 39:14.741
I couldn't say.

39:14.780 --> 39:17.749
I can tell you that
that package, worked properly,

39:17.780 --> 39:19.645
will make you
very, very wealthy.

39:19.690 --> 39:25.128
Steven decided he had
other ideas for it.

39:25.160 --> 39:28.755
Whether or not you decide
to honor those ideas is...

39:28.800 --> 39:30.495
entirely up to you.

39:50.920 --> 39:53.480
(whirring)

40:02.800 --> 40:03.949
MAN:
Skim milk latte

40:04.000 --> 40:05.968
for Joan and whole
milk latte for Andrew.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.161
Thank you.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.839
Oh. Excuse me.

40:11.870 --> 40:13.804
Here we go.

40:13.840 --> 40:17.833
Oh. Thanks.
(chuckles)

40:17.880 --> 40:20.075
Skim milk.

40:20.110 --> 40:22.146
I think
you gave me the wrong one.
Oh.

40:22.180 --> 40:23.977
Sorry.

40:24.020 --> 40:27.808
So, what's
going on?

40:27.850 --> 40:30.114
Why'd you want to meet?

40:30.160 --> 40:32.720
Um...

40:33.990 --> 40:37.027
Andrew,
you're such a great guy,

40:37.060 --> 40:40.427
and I'm lucky to know you.
I just...

40:43.000 --> 40:46.003
I'm not what you're looking for
right now?

40:46.040 --> 40:47.962
Yeah, I-I don't know
what I'm looking for.

40:48.010 --> 40:49.432
That's the problem.
Yeah.

40:51.610 --> 40:54.579
Um..._
I mean, if...

40:54.620 --> 40:57.874
(gagging)
Andrew, are you okay?

40:57.920 --> 40:59.717
(gagging, grunting)

40:59.750 --> 41:02.878
Oh, my God,
what's wrong?

41:02.920 --> 41:04.581
(gasps)

41:05.990 --> 41:08.185
Oh, my God.
Somebody call an ambulance!

41:08.230 --> 41:09.959
Okay. Okay. Okay.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.865
Andrew. Andrew.

41:11.900 --> 41:14.960
Oh, God.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.992
No. Andrew?

41:18.040 --> 41:21.066
(panﬁng)

41:21.110 --> 41:23.499
Okay.

41:23.540 --> 41:27.044
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten....
