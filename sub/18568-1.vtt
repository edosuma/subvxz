[BOAT HORN HONKING]

02:21.743 --> 02:24.871
[SIREN]

02:41.890 --> 02:44.393
All right,
make way there, make way.

02:50.525 --> 02:52.986
How long was he under,
Larry?

02:53.070 --> 02:54.488
Seven or eight minutes.

02:54.571 --> 02:58.451
He was talking and then suddenly just cut off.

03:01.704 --> 03:03.123
Any hope?

03:03.206 --> 03:05.292
Of what, reincarnation?

03:05.334 --> 03:07.419
This man's drowned.

03:07.503 --> 03:10.631
His suit burst.
He didn't have much of a chance.

03:10.673 --> 03:13.718
With this suit,
he had no chance.

03:13.801 --> 03:15.220
One of yours?

03:15.303 --> 03:18.473
Look, Doc, I rent them.
I don't guarantee them.

03:20.893 --> 03:22.353
Look after him.

03:24.689 --> 03:27.984
Uh, just a minute Doc.
What do we owe you?

03:28.067 --> 03:30.862
Not a thing.
It's part of my job.

03:32.114 --> 03:34.408
I understand you're looking
for sunken treasure.

03:34.450 --> 03:36.702
Mm-hmm.
Spanish gallions.

03:36.744 --> 03:39.789
Hmm. Makes sense.

03:41.457 --> 03:42.876
Doctor.

03:45.003 --> 03:47.965
The diver--we didn't
know him very well.

03:48.007 --> 03:49.425
Did he have a wife?

03:49.508 --> 03:50.968
No,my dear.

03:51.010 --> 03:53.972
He didn't have a wife,
and he had no family.

03:54.013 --> 03:55.557
Bless you
for the question.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.059
You know,
for a little while,

03:58.143 --> 04:01.105
Ithought that nobody
gave a damn.

04:23.922 --> 04:25.382
Did I draw?

04:25.424 --> 04:26.633
You drew.

04:28.344 --> 04:29.887
Light's bad.

04:31.931 --> 04:33.307
Throw the queen away.

04:33.391 --> 04:34.642
Queen?

04:34.726 --> 04:37.687
Queen. Before I catch you
with the store.

04:39.773 --> 04:40.858
Queen.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.488
Awfully good choice.

04:49.826 --> 04:50.869
Gin.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.499
You have exceptional
card sense, old friend.

04:55.583 --> 04:57.043
exceptional card sense.

04:57.126 --> 05:00.046
Application my dear Linc,
just simple application.

05:00.129 --> 05:03.466
Next week, you can look
at my hand.

05:04.593 --> 05:06.011
I'll ask the bartender.

05:06.094 --> 05:09.557
Excuse me, do you know
a Mr. Mark Brittain?

05:09.598 --> 05:11.058
Is he here?

05:11.142 --> 05:13.519
Yes sir,Over there.
Back of the trellis.

05:13.603 --> 05:14.979
Fellow with the cap?

05:15.063 --> 05:16.022
That's right.

05:16.106 --> 05:18.024
Thank you.
Come on, Rosa.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.865
Well, Mr. Brittain.

05:24.907 --> 05:28.369
Fellow named Trench said
I'd find you in here.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.665
You found me.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.250
I'm Victor Rossiter.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.419
How are you?

05:38.422 --> 05:41.217
don't you feel
a little left out?

05:41.301 --> 05:43.678
Oh, come here.

05:43.762 --> 05:45.764
My name
is Rosa Lucchesi.

05:45.847 --> 05:46.765
Yeah.

05:46.849 --> 05:48.767
Can we buy you a drink?

05:48.851 --> 05:50.269
Thanks, we got one.

05:50.352 --> 05:52.772
This fellow Trench says
that you were a lieutenant,

05:52.855 --> 05:54.274
in a submarine.

05:54.357 --> 05:56.776
That I was,
and I was many things..

05:56.860 --> 05:58.737
Mm-hm, well, so was I.

05:58.820 --> 06:01.782
But I was also
on a destroyer.

06:01.865 --> 06:05.036
You trying to start
a legion post here,
Mr. Rossiter?

06:06.704 --> 06:09.082
Trench also said that
you were a good diver,

06:09.165 --> 06:12.252
and for a price,
you'd put on a suit.

06:12.294 --> 06:14.672
For a good price, I'd put on a suit,

06:14.755 --> 06:16.674
but not one of Trench's suits.

06:16.757 --> 06:19.135
That would take more money than you've got

06:19.218 --> 06:21.679
and more of a death wish than I've got..

06:21.763 --> 06:23.932
We'll order a new diver's suit.

06:23.974 --> 06:27.060
Haven't you had enough?
You lost one diver today, right?

06:27.144 --> 06:29.063
Well that won't happen again.

06:29.104 --> 06:31.023
We've got a map, Brittain..

06:31.107 --> 06:32.525
An authentic map.

06:32.608 --> 06:34.527
We've got a map, too.

06:34.611 --> 06:37.531
We got it at the gas station.

06:37.614 --> 06:40.534
A galleon went down 3 miles from here.

06:40.617 --> 06:44.205
It carried gold bullion
worth millions of dollars.

06:44.246 --> 06:45.748
That it did, Miss Lucchesi.

06:45.790 --> 06:47.750
And 10 miles up the coast,

06:47.834 --> 06:50.754
a ship called the Sevilla
hit a reef and sunk

06:50.795 --> 06:52.756
full of pearls and emeralds.

06:52.798 --> 06:56.260
North of the cove,
there was a ship called the Almirante.

06:56.302 --> 06:58.262
It had its magazine blown up.

06:58.304 --> 07:00.765
It was carrying treasure to King Philip.

07:00.848 --> 07:03.268
Lady, I've lived here a lot of years..

07:03.351 --> 07:05.270
I can read you every legend,

07:05.354 --> 07:06.772
in Spanish if you like.

07:06.855 --> 07:09.733
You name the ship,
I'll draw you the riggings.

07:09.817 --> 07:11.777
This map shows exactly where that ship went down.

07:11.861 --> 07:14.239
None of us can dive, but you can.

07:14.322 --> 07:15.740
You name the price.

07:15.824 --> 07:17.784
You can have it in cash

07:17.826 --> 07:19.786
or a piece of the action.

07:19.828 --> 07:21.288
Piece of what action?

07:21.330 --> 07:23.791
Don't you realize that every 50 years

07:23.833 --> 07:27.962
some dedicated
professionals get lucky and come up with a find?

07:28.004 --> 07:29.506
You're not dedicated professionals.

07:29.547 --> 07:32.634
You're a brotherhood
of happy, free-swinging thinkers.

07:32.676 --> 07:34.595
You've got a crap shooter's instinct.

07:34.678 --> 07:37.890
Why don't you go to Vegas?
You'd be better off.

07:37.932 --> 07:39.809
Please, look at this.

07:43.104 --> 07:44.105
[VICTOR]
Hmmm?

07:45.941 --> 07:47.735
That's quite a map.

07:49.445 --> 07:51.822
But Mr. Langley and I are very busy.

07:51.906 --> 07:54.325
We charter a small
but dependable fishing boat

07:54.409 --> 07:57.871
to people who like
to go to sea and catch bass

07:57.954 --> 08:00.874
and not pieces of eight,
which they can't.

08:00.958 --> 08:04.795
What part of Italy
are you from, Miss Lucchesi?

08:04.879 --> 08:06.714
Naples.

08:06.756 --> 08:09.759
Must be beautiful there
this time of year.

08:14.306 --> 08:15.474
Well...

08:15.516 --> 08:17.935
Well, you may change your mind.

08:17.977 --> 08:19.896
If we're not on board,

08:20.021 --> 08:22.399
you can find us
at this motel right here.

08:22.440 --> 08:25.360
And if you'd like
to charter a fishing boat,

08:25.444 --> 08:27.029
we're at the dock.

08:27.112 --> 08:28.948
Ask anyone.

08:34.578 --> 08:36.039
Imagine her drinking red wine

08:36.121 --> 08:38.500
with a 50 cent
sharpie like him.

08:38.582 --> 08:42.379
That's a beautiful woman.
She walks well.

08:42.462 --> 08:44.006
You're quite right.

08:46.008 --> 08:48.595
She walks well.

08:58.439 --> 09:00.775
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

09:00.858 --> 09:04.321
Give me a stick. I'll beat it to death.

09:05.489 --> 09:07.533
Blessings on Thee,
O Landlord.

with cheek of jowl.

09:11.495 --> 09:13.873
Stand aside
while the crew boards.

09:13.957 --> 09:15.834
You ain't boarding
this boat..

09:15.875 --> 09:17.377
Not tonight.
Maybe never.

09:17.419 --> 09:18.879
You're wrong, Mr. Trench.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.340
Short of a hurricane
or your departing this earth,

09:21.423 --> 09:23.384
we're going to board
this boat,

09:23.426 --> 09:25.887
and you're a minute away
from losing your teeth..

09:25.928 --> 09:28.431
Brittain,
you owe me 190 bucks for dockage,

09:28.473 --> 09:30.892
$363 for gas,
$88 for ice and supplies.

09:30.976 --> 09:33.353
That makes a total
of $641 overdue and collectable.

09:33.437 --> 09:35.898
We never hung you up
on a bill.

09:35.981 --> 09:37.900
I ain't going
to let you.

09:37.984 --> 09:39.402
I ain't
no credit union..

09:39.485 --> 09:42.405
You bring the dough, you can get on this boat.

09:42.489 --> 09:43.907
You got
till tomorrow night.

09:43.990 --> 09:45.409
Can't we sleep
on board?

09:45.492 --> 09:47.953
You've got the keys.
We can't go anywhere.

09:48.037 --> 09:50.915
You can't go anywhere
because I'm keeping the keys.

09:50.998 --> 09:52.583
Gently, gently Trench,
gently.

09:52.667 --> 09:56.463
Look Brittain,
I'm going to tell you one more time...

09:56.504 --> 09:57.964
Don't poke, Trench.

09:58.006 --> 10:01.343
Don't you know
how it can irritate a guy?

10:04.096 --> 10:06.516
Let that remind you
to keep a civil tounge

10:06.557 --> 10:08.017
in your big, fat head..

10:08.101 --> 10:11.521
And also to check out
your diver's suits..

10:11.605 --> 10:13.065
Can he swim?

10:13.148 --> 10:15.192
We'll check
the morning papers.

10:29.333 --> 10:30.626
Good morning.

10:30.710 --> 10:32.170
Does Rossiter live here?

10:32.253 --> 10:35.131
That's correct.
I'm one of his party.

10:35.215 --> 10:36.174
You're Brittain.

10:36.257 --> 10:37.175
Mm-hmm.

10:37.217 --> 10:38.385
Come in.

10:41.513 --> 10:44.350
Mr. Rossiter
and Miss Lucchesi are in town

10:44.433 --> 10:46.853
hoping to find
a new diver.

10:46.936 --> 10:48.354
I expect them shortly.

10:48.438 --> 10:49.898
Cup of coffee?

10:49.981 --> 10:51.400
Thanks, no.

10:51.483 --> 10:52.359
Forgive me.

10:52.442 --> 10:54.653
I'm Eric Lauffnauer.

10:55.905 --> 10:58.741
We have, uh something in common, Mr. Brittain.

10:58.783 --> 10:59.867
What's that?

10:59.909 --> 11:02.454
Iwas
in the submarines also.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.414
Hmm. I wonderwho invaded Europe?

11:04.456 --> 11:06.959
Everbody I've met
in the past 24 hours

11:07.000 --> 11:08.419
is an old salt.

11:10.004 --> 11:13.091
We have the makings
of a select fraternity.

11:13.174 --> 11:14.175
That so?

11:14.217 --> 11:15.552
Rather fortunate
Though,

11:15.635 --> 11:18.138
that we didn't meet
during the war.

11:18.221 --> 11:20.724
I commanded the U-17.

11:24.145 --> 11:27.065
There is always
two sides to every question,

11:27.148 --> 11:28.274
Mr. Brittain.

11:28.316 --> 11:29.526
True.

11:29.609 --> 11:32.571
What kind of sub were you on?

11:32.613 --> 11:35.699
Fleet type.
I was in the Pacific.

11:35.783 --> 11:37.702
We operated
in the Atlantic.

11:37.743 --> 11:40.079
Come out alright, did you?

11:40.121 --> 11:44.042
No. I was drowned
off Okinawa.

11:44.125 --> 11:46.587
I mean your sub.

11:46.670 --> 11:49.757
The man's here
to take the job, Mr.Lauffnaur.

11:49.840 --> 11:53.219
I only reminisce
about the war on Memorial Day.

11:53.302 --> 11:55.805
We'll try it again
after lunch.

11:57.015 --> 11:59.059
Well, well, well, well.

11:59.101 --> 12:01.103
Here you are, Eric.

12:01.186 --> 12:02.438
Thank you..

12:02.479 --> 12:04.732
You decided to join us, eh Mr. Brittain?

12:04.815 --> 12:06.734
I decided to work
for you.

12:06.818 --> 12:08.737
I am glad to hear that.

12:08.778 --> 12:11.281

payable in advance.

12:15.452 --> 12:17.330
That's
a little stiff, isn't it?

12:17.371 --> 12:19.332
I might be
a little stiff

12:19.415 --> 12:20.875
before I find
your galleon.

12:20.959 --> 12:22.585
That's the tab,
Rossiter.

12:23.712 --> 12:25.422
It's alright.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.475
In advance.

Yeah, fine, fine.
It's a deal.

new equipment

from Orlando's.

It'll be here
tomorrow before lunch.

have you got?

12:59.585 --> 13:01.045
We're using Trench's

13:01.087 --> 13:03.506
Not with me
you're not using Trench's.

13:03.590 --> 13:06.051
There's a marine store
downtown called Daley's.

13:06.093 --> 13:08.012
You can rent one
down there.

13:08.095 --> 13:11.057
Check your boat in.
We'll use mine.

thousand pounds
of weight on me,</i>

16:07.505 --> 16:10.008
<i> so relax.
It's going
to take a while.</i>

16:18.976 --> 16:20.436
<i>[MARK]
Hey, partner.</i>

16:20.478 --> 16:22.439
What have you got,
Mark?

16:22.480 --> 16:24.441
<i> The fatigue
and the blues.</i>

16:24.483 --> 16:25.943
<i> Pull me up,
Linc.</i>

16:25.984 --> 16:27.528
Now, wait a minute.

16:27.611 --> 16:30.948
You've still got
8 or 10 minutes of the hour left.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.451
<i> Well, you can
have them back,
Buddy.</i>

16:33.493 --> 16:34.994
<i> Pull me up.</i>

16:35.078 --> 16:36.705
Pull him up right away.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.458
Let's not have
the same thing happen again.

16:42.545 --> 16:44.672
All right.
Pull him up.

16:47.008 --> 16:49.970
<i> Hold it.
wait a minute.
hold it.</i>

16:50.053 --> 16:52.347
Did you find something?

16:52.431 --> 16:55.184
<i> Think so, yeah. <i/></i>

16:55.267 --> 16:57.645
What is it Mark?
What is it?

16:57.728 --> 16:59.647
<i> It's a sight
to delight</i>

16:59.731 --> 17:01.316
<i> Mr. Lauffnaur's
practiced eye.</i>

17:01.357 --> 17:04.194
<i> I wish you were
down here,
<i/>Herr Kapitan.<i/></i>

17:04.277 --> 17:06.195
<i> The nostalgia
would kill you.</i>

17:06.238 --> 17:07.281
Describe it.

17:07.364 --> 17:09.074
<i> Hmm, very simple. <i/></i>

17:09.157 --> 17:11.993
<i> It's a German submarine, <i/>
Kapitan.</i>

17:12.036 --> 17:13.454
<i> Ask Rossiter
if he'll settle</i>

17:13.538 --> 17:14.914
<i> for World War II
souveniers,</i>

17:14.998 --> 17:16.750
<i> Or we could raise her</i>

17:16.833 --> 17:20.295
<i> and you could put her in
your parlor as a memento.</i>

17:41.861 --> 17:44.823
<i>
[MARK]
All right, Linc..
Pull me up.</i>

18:01.675 --> 18:04.762
What sre you
looking for Eric, ghosts?

18:05.930 --> 18:08.141
Really incredible.

18:08.224 --> 18:11.144
She was one
of the small jobs.

18:11.228 --> 18:14.064
Reported missing
I think about 1943.

18:14.148 --> 18:15.649
Hmm, fascinating.

18:15.733 --> 18:18.361
Well,
thanks for nothing, Brittain.

18:18.402 --> 18:21.364
I guaranteed a look,
not a find, Buddy.

18:21.447 --> 18:24.367
What do you guess
her tonnage to be?

18:24.451 --> 18:27.538
Oh, I don't know.
I'd say maybe 300.

18:28.706 --> 18:30.124
She looked undamaged.

18:30.207 --> 18:33.169
My guess is
that her ballast tanks are still full.

18:33.252 --> 18:35.964
What looked
like the escape hatch was closed.

18:36.006 --> 18:38.967
I don't know
if anybody got out of her,

18:39.009 --> 18:41.929
but she's probably full
of sea water anyway.

18:42.012 --> 18:44.849
What if her valves held?

18:44.932 --> 18:47.810
They might have held.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.897
If her valves held,
she's dry. So what??

18:50.939 --> 18:53.776
With the tanks blown,
we could raise her.

18:53.859 --> 18:54.777
Raise her?

18:54.860 --> 18:56.153
Raise her?

18:56.237 --> 18:58.573
What the hell would we do
with a submarine?

18:58.614 --> 19:00.617
Refit her. Use her
For sightseeing.

19:00.658 --> 19:02.619
Sell her to a museum.

19:02.661 --> 19:04.079
The possibilities
are endless.

19:04.120 --> 19:07.082
Brittain, do you think
you could find it?

19:07.166 --> 19:08.584
The sub, probably.

19:08.667 --> 19:11.128
Do you think you could
find it right now?

19:11.170 --> 19:13.464
Again, probably,
but why?

19:13.548 --> 19:16.927
I'd like you to attach
a line and float a buoy.

19:17.010 --> 19:18.387
You mean right now?

19:18.470 --> 19:19.388
Right now.

19:19.471 --> 19:20.889
That'll be overtime.

19:20.973 --> 19:22.391
We'll pay you.

19:22.474 --> 19:24.602
Where do you get
this "we"?

19:24.644 --> 19:27.730
Rosa's doing
the financing, check with her.

19:27.772 --> 19:29.941
You have
a reason?

19:30.025 --> 19:31.318
Yes.

19:31.401 --> 19:33.821
I'd like
to think it out.

19:33.904 --> 19:36.240
Then I'll explain.

19:36.282 --> 19:38.200
That's good enough
for me.

19:38.284 --> 19:41.204
All right,
we'd better get to it.

19:41.287 --> 19:44.291
There's not much daylight.
Lincoln, let's go.

19:46.502 --> 19:47.961
Hey, uh Captain?

19:48.045 --> 19:48.921
Mm-hmm?

19:49.004 --> 19:50.965
You ever get
depth-charged?

19:51.048 --> 19:51.924
Yes, often.

19:52.008 --> 19:53.468
Slip and fall down

19:53.551 --> 19:55.970
and maybe hit your head
a little bit?

19:56.054 --> 19:57.472
I'm quite sane, Mr. Brittain.

19:57.514 --> 19:59.933
Big deal. So now
we lasso a submarine..

20:00.017 --> 20:02.937
Would you like
to explain why, Eric?

20:03.020 --> 20:06.274
If we can raise her and refit her...

20:09.069 --> 20:11.738
Why not play pirates.

20:20.415 --> 20:21.791
Good evening.

20:23.084 --> 20:25.379
Evening. You want Mark?

20:25.462 --> 20:27.923
Yes, I'd like to see him.

20:30.217 --> 20:31.218
Hey Mark.

20:31.260 --> 20:32.178
Yo!

20:32.220 --> 20:33.721
We've got company.

20:35.557 --> 20:36.433
Well...

20:36.516 --> 20:37.517
Oh, hello.

20:37.601 --> 20:40.479
I was afraid
you might be sleeping.

20:40.562 --> 20:42.940
No, it's too early
for that. Come on aboard.

20:43.023 --> 20:43.941
Thank you.

20:44.025 --> 20:45.526
Watch your head.

20:50.866 --> 20:52.367
beautiful night, huh?

20:52.451 --> 20:54.078
Like Naples?

20:54.161 --> 20:57.790
Stars are stars.
Ever look at them, Mr. Brittain?

20:57.873 --> 20:59.500
On occasion, yes.

20:59.542 --> 21:02.295
For navigational
purposes only.

21:02.379 --> 21:04.756
Mm-hm, but not
romantically?

21:04.840 --> 21:06.300
Tell me something,
Miss Lucchesi,

21:06.383 --> 21:08.302
is this
a mid-week seduction

21:08.385 --> 21:10.930
or the opening gambit
of a con job?

21:10.972 --> 21:12.932
Is that
how I strike you?

21:12.974 --> 21:15.894
You're financing
this whole operation, are you not?

21:15.977 --> 21:19.314
Yes, with all
the money I have, Mr. Brittain.

21:19.398 --> 21:22.985
In Italy,
during the war,

21:23.027 --> 21:24.820
I lost my family,

21:24.862 --> 21:27.323
my illusions,
my patience.

21:27.407 --> 21:30.035
I want only
one thing now--

21:30.076 --> 21:34.123
To never be
cold or wet or hungry again.

21:34.206 --> 21:36.333
Is that terrible
for you?

21:36.417 --> 21:39.337
Well, it depends.
If you're telling me

21:39.420 --> 21:42.841
that you'll settle
for three meals a day and Vic Rossiter,

21:42.924 --> 21:45.594
then I got to say
You got cheap tastes.

21:50.141 --> 21:54.020
But if you're
looking for sable and a deluxe cruiser,

21:54.103 --> 21:56.022
well, that makes
more sense.

21:56.064 --> 21:58.191
I want more than that.

21:58.233 --> 22:01.695
I want my life to be
whipped cream

22:01.737 --> 22:03.614
and silk sheets.

22:03.698 --> 22:06.033
And without problems.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.535
You're not exclusive.

22:07.577 --> 22:09.537
Perhaps I am not.

22:09.621 --> 22:12.249
I'll steal, if necessary.

22:12.291 --> 22:15.794
But, uh I have
certain reservations.

22:15.836 --> 22:16.796
That's interesting.

22:16.837 --> 22:18.840
Now, what kind
of reservation?

22:18.881 --> 22:22.010
For instance
uh, a hot stove you wouldn't steal?

22:22.093 --> 22:24.054
I wouldn't steal from those

22:24.137 --> 22:25.973
whocouldn't afford to lose.

22:26.056 --> 22:30.394
How do you like this?
A blonde Italian Robin Hood.

22:30.436 --> 22:31.938
What about you,
Mr. Brittain?

22:32.021 --> 22:35.442
Do you have
a master plan or a set ofdreams?

22:35.525 --> 22:36.985
I don't need them.

22:37.027 --> 22:39.029
I just live my life
as I see fit,

22:39.071 --> 22:41.532
and do what I want.
I have a ball.

22:41.573 --> 22:43.367
I take things
as they come.

22:43.409 --> 22:45.453
Then take this,
will you?

22:45.536 --> 22:47.497
This is the sort
of thing

22:47.580 --> 22:49.624
that comes one time
in your life.

22:49.708 --> 22:50.917
Go on.

22:50.959 --> 22:53.754
Eric has an idea,
an incredibleidea.

22:53.796 --> 22:55.756
If we could raise
that sub,

22:55.798 --> 22:58.634
get it yo work,
why not pirates?

22:58.718 --> 23:00.845
You're kidding me.

23:00.887 --> 23:03.056
You think I'm kidding?

23:03.139 --> 23:05.684
A hijack
with a submarine?

23:05.767 --> 23:06.977
Mm-hmm.

23:08.103 --> 23:10.356
I got a better idea.

23:10.398 --> 23:12.859
We put you in a bikini

23:12.942 --> 23:15.820
and strap you
to the wings of a 707,

23:15.904 --> 23:18.323
and we fly you
over Fort Knox.

23:18.407 --> 23:21.827
While all the people
on the ground are looking at you,

23:21.911 --> 23:24.830
we sneak
in the back door and steal the gold.

23:24.914 --> 23:25.915
Please.

23:25.957 --> 23:27.625
Take me seriously.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.127
You I take seriously.

23:29.169 --> 23:32.631
But not some pipe dream
about running off in a submarine

23:32.673 --> 23:35.092
to pull a heist
on the high seas.

23:35.175 --> 23:37.678
That, Miss Lucchesi,
is for laughs.

23:55.615 --> 23:57.993
Have you ever thought
about what you could get

23:58.076 --> 24:00.537
by even pointing a gun
at an ocean liner?

24:00.621 --> 24:02.081
30 years, if we're lucky.

24:02.164 --> 24:05.042
Failing that,
that leaky war memorial at the ocean bottom

24:05.126 --> 24:07.545
might wind up
back at the ocean bottom,

24:07.629 --> 24:10.048
but this time
with all of us in it.

24:10.131 --> 24:14.011
Will you come over
to the motel and discuss this?

24:14.094 --> 24:16.096
I don't think so.

24:18.099 --> 24:21.019
If you're
so difficult now, Mr. Brittain,

24:21.102 --> 24:23.688
how can we ever
become friends?

24:23.772 --> 24:26.650
I got a funny feeling
we are friends.

24:26.733 --> 24:28.694
Very good friends.

24:30.071 --> 24:30.988
Linc.

24:31.072 --> 24:32.532
What?

24:32.615 --> 24:35.910
There are three idiots
over at the motel having a seance,

24:35.994 --> 24:38.872
and they need
two more idiots to make a quorum.

24:38.956 --> 24:40.415
And they sent for us?

24:40.457 --> 24:41.417
Who else?

24:43.294 --> 24:46.214
<i>We could stop
the Queen Mary
anywhere here,</i>

24:46.255 --> 24:49.259
just off the coast
of Abaco Island.

24:49.300 --> 24:53.222
We'll travel
at night, surface, wait for her.

24:53.305 --> 24:55.224
Wait a minute.
Just a moment.

24:55.307 --> 24:57.768
That submarine's
been on the bottom of the ocean

24:57.852 --> 24:59.145
for 20 years.

24:59.312 --> 25:01.189
Brittain, let me
ask you something.

25:01.272 --> 25:02.691
Can you guarantee

25:02.774 --> 25:05.152
that you'd be able
to raise her?

25:05.235 --> 25:06.695
I guarantee you nothing.

25:06.778 --> 25:08.864
For argument's sake,
Mr. Lauffnaur,

25:08.948 --> 25:10.366
let's assume she's dry.

25:10.449 --> 25:12.869
Let's further assume
you can raise her

25:12.952 --> 25:14.787
and get her
in operating condition.

25:14.871 --> 25:16.331
<i>Enter the gracious Queen.</i>

25:16.373 --> 25:18.792
What are you going
to do with her?

25:18.875 --> 25:20.335
Or to her?

25:20.377 --> 25:22.838
There must be thousands
of dollars in the bank

25:22.922 --> 25:24.840
and gold in her
bullion room.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.926
We could take
a million dollars.

25:26.968 --> 25:29.888
I'll bet it could even
be more than a million.

25:29.971 --> 25:32.599
This could be
the biggest heist ever.

25:32.641 --> 25:35.102
It could be a lot
of things...

25:35.144 --> 25:39.065
<i>Assuming you can get
the Queen Mary
to stop for you.</i>

25:39.148 --> 25:40.608
Man has a big point.

25:40.650 --> 25:42.152
Think of it this way.

25:42.193 --> 25:45.113
Think of a submarine
as a big pistol

25:45.155 --> 25:47.116
that holds men
and machinery.

25:47.199 --> 25:50.369
Then you aim this pistol

25:50.453 --> 25:52.872
at the head
of your victim...

25:52.955 --> 25:54.874
Full of blanks,
mind you--

25:54.958 --> 25:56.918
torpedoes
with dummy warheads.

25:57.002 --> 25:59.546
<i>But the victim,
the Queen Mary,</i>

25:59.588 --> 26:01.173
does not know this.

26:01.256 --> 26:04.343
I believe we can assume

26:04.427 --> 26:06.304
<i>that our Queen
won't take</i>

26:06.387 --> 26:07.805
any unnecessary risks.

26:07.889 --> 26:10.976
She'll allow herself
to be boarded.

26:11.059 --> 26:13.020
Then, as Rosa
has suggested,

26:13.061 --> 26:16.023
it's gold bullion
and cash.

26:16.065 --> 26:18.526
We go back
to our submarine,

26:18.568 --> 26:20.653
submerge,
leave the scene.

26:20.737 --> 26:22.614
Yeah, and figure
the take.

26:22.697 --> 26:24.616
A million bucks or more.

26:24.699 --> 26:28.162
We could walk away
from this with nothing to worry about

26:28.245 --> 26:30.665
for the rest
of our lives.

26:30.748 --> 26:33.459
Yeah, I like it.
It makes sense.

26:33.543 --> 26:36.379
It makes sense
if you win the game.

26:36.463 --> 26:37.839
The game you're a playingis that

26:37.923 --> 26:40.384
you're holding an unloaded pistol at a stranger's head.

26:40.467 --> 26:41.885
You figure he's going to throw up his hands.

26:41.969 --> 26:44.055
Suppose the stranger
spits in your eye

26:44.138 --> 26:46.057
and says,
"Go ahead and shoot."

26:46.140 --> 26:48.017
What the hell are you
going to do then?

26:48.059 --> 26:50.437
Now, hold on,
this is all a joke, right?

26:50.520 --> 26:53.190
Nobody here thinks
this is going to work?

26:53.232 --> 26:54.692
You just get this clear.

26:54.733 --> 26:57.236
If you don't think
it can work,

26:57.278 --> 26:59.238
you don't belong
on this trip.

26:59.280 --> 27:02.242
I don't relish the ides
of being cooped up in a sub

27:02.283 --> 27:05.495
<i>with a caramel-colored
lush, anyway.</i>

27:05.579 --> 27:06.955
Forgive him, Linc, please.

27:07.039 --> 27:08.540
He didn't mean it.

27:10.668 --> 27:13.963
<i>I'll take your word
for that.</i>

27:16.007 --> 27:18.427
Hey, come on,
this is ridiculous.

27:18.510 --> 27:19.928
Why the argument, huh?

27:20.012 --> 27:22.431
Let's get on with the,
uh, with the business.

27:22.473 --> 27:25.893
Did you know
this thing is so wild, it can work?

27:25.977 --> 27:27.896
It's so nutty
it can work.

27:27.937 --> 27:29.439
Eric...

27:29.522 --> 27:32.109
You think it's possible.

27:34.069 --> 27:35.946
What about it?

27:35.988 --> 27:38.115
I take it
you are willing.

27:38.157 --> 27:41.619
We all have
special needs,
Mr. Brittain.

27:41.661 --> 27:43.705
I wish it were
catching.

27:43.788 --> 27:46.416
I'd like you along.

27:50.045 --> 27:52.006
Let's take it by steps.

27:52.048 --> 27:54.509
First we got o find
an enclosed mooring

27:54.551 --> 27:56.011
somewhere
down the coastline

27:56.052 --> 27:58.472
where it's nice and quiet,
nobody around, check?

27:58.555 --> 27:59.473
Check.

27:59.556 --> 28:01.016
Then tomorrow,
I'll go over

28:01.100 --> 28:03.519
and see if I can't
raise that submarine.

28:03.602 --> 28:05.062
Lieutenant Brittain, what a pity

28:05.104 --> 28:07.523
we have never
before served in the same navy.

28:07.607 --> 28:09.526
We should do
very well together.

28:09.609 --> 28:12.029
You just see you run
a taut ship, Commander,

28:12.112 --> 28:15.616
because in this little war,
we're going to need one.

28:15.658 --> 28:16.659
Let's go.

29:41.045 --> 29:42.505
Look at the buoy.

29:46.635 --> 29:48.971
He must have reached
the sub.

29:57.939 --> 30:01.235
How long will it take him, Eric?

30:01.318 --> 30:04.322
15 minutes, half hour.
Maybe longer.

30:04.405 --> 30:05.865
Not much longer.

30:05.907 --> 30:09.077
It better not
take him much longer.

30:09.119 --> 30:11.788
What will he do?

30:11.872 --> 30:13.791
He'll go to the escape hatch.

30:13.874 --> 30:15.835
If the trunk
underneath is flooded

30:15.918 --> 30:17.837
he might get it open.

30:17.920 --> 30:21.591
If he does,
he'll move inside and close the hatch...

32:22.560 --> 32:24.604
Once he's inside
the tube...

32:25.564 --> 32:29.360
he'll, uh,
try to open the drain.

32:29.443 --> 32:30.361
Go on.

32:30.444 --> 32:32.029
Then what?

32:32.113 --> 32:35.533
At that point,
either the water just stays there, unmoving,

32:35.617 --> 32:37.994
because the sub
is filled with water,

32:38.078 --> 32:40.038
or it will drain away.

32:40.122 --> 32:43.501
If it does,
he'll try to open the lower hatch.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.609
But if it's
not possible, he'll come up?

33:07.319 --> 33:10.030
There's 100 feet
of sea water

33:11.532 --> 33:14.994
35,000 pounds
on that hatch.

33:15.036 --> 33:16.955
He could never open it.

33:18.331 --> 33:20.417
Then you'll have
to take up another card game,

33:20.501 --> 33:21.877
and we'll have
missed another one.

33:21.919 --> 33:24.672
Victor, please.

33:24.755 --> 33:27.008
Hey, hey,
come on Baby,

33:27.091 --> 33:28.635
What's the matter?

33:28.676 --> 33:30.554
Nobody dies
in Italy?

34:05.885 --> 34:07.136
58 minutes.

34:07.220 --> 34:09.054
Well, kiss him off.

34:10.098 --> 34:13.685
Eric, any...chance?

34:14.728 --> 34:16.688
He's got
a job down there.

34:16.772 --> 34:19.233
He's got to stay on his lung,

34:19.317 --> 34:21.194
because
if that sub is dry,

34:21.277 --> 34:23.237
It'll all be
dead air

34:23.321 --> 34:25.239
and damn little of it.

34:25.324 --> 34:28.243
He'll
blow the ballast if he can.

34:28.327 --> 34:30.246
But there's a lot of ifs.

34:30.329 --> 34:33.750
The valves
of the air flask have to hold.

34:33.791 --> 34:35.752
There's got to be
enough pressure

34:35.835 --> 34:38.213
to blow
all the water from the ballast.

34:38.255 --> 34:40.299
He's got
quite a job.

35:34.818 --> 35:36.946
Hey!
Hooray!

35:41.117 --> 35:42.661
[ENGINE STARTS]

36:33.760 --> 36:34.761
Upsy-Daisy.

36:39.766 --> 36:41.101
Give me that light.

37:19.061 --> 37:22.398
Quite an exceptional
gentleman... in his day.

37:23.649 --> 37:25.109
He was left here...

37:25.151 --> 37:27.111
probably
at his own orders

37:27.195 --> 37:29.781
so that his men
could get out.

37:29.864 --> 37:32.743
Then he, himself,
filled the ballast tanks

37:32.826 --> 37:35.830
to let the sub sink.

37:52.390 --> 37:56.436
Then he just sat....
Waiting to die.

37:57.979 --> 38:00.399
Well, what do you
want to do,

38:00.482 --> 38:02.359
stuff him
and sell tickets, Hmm?

38:02.401 --> 38:06.197
We'll get hold
of some fishing nets, some canvas...

38:06.280 --> 38:07.699
And bury him at sea?

38:08.908 --> 38:09.826
Yes.

38:09.910 --> 38:12.079
Would you help me?

38:12.162 --> 38:13.872
I'll find some canvas.

38:15.666 --> 38:19.295
I can think of a hundred
better ways to die.

38:29.598 --> 38:32.518
All right, let's get
this stuff ashore

38:32.560 --> 38:34.020
and burn it.

38:34.062 --> 38:35.689
Pass this along.

38:38.567 --> 38:39.484
Rosa!

38:39.568 --> 38:40.486
Yes.

38:40.569 --> 38:42.613
Pass this through.

39:19.196 --> 39:20.280
Victor!

39:38.175 --> 39:40.595
We're going backto the boat, Mark.

39:40.678 --> 39:42.013
Yeah, O.K.

39:42.055 --> 39:44.099
Come along
as soon as you're through.

39:44.182 --> 39:45.183
Check.

40:17.887 --> 40:19.347
Well,
what's the verdict?

40:19.389 --> 40:21.349
4-0 is the verdict.

40:21.432 --> 40:23.852
She's in better shape
than we dared hope.

40:23.935 --> 40:25.854
Not too much corrosion, little damage.

40:25.938 --> 40:27.398
Batteries are dead,
naturally.

40:27.439 --> 40:29.817
That's probably
what stopped her to begin with.

40:29.900 --> 40:31.319
Let's get started,
Huh?

40:31.402 --> 40:32.820
What's
the first thing?

40:32.904 --> 40:34.489
I want a drink first.

40:34.531 --> 40:37.492
What we need now
is a mechanic. A good mechanic,

40:37.534 --> 40:40.245
somebody who knows
sub engines inside and out.

40:40.329 --> 40:43.666
That's great.
We'll put an ad in the paper.

40:43.708 --> 40:46.210
No need.
I know such a man.

40:46.294 --> 40:49.255
I worked in the Brooklyn
navy yard a while back.

40:49.297 --> 40:50.715
Met a chap
named Moreno.

40:50.757 --> 40:52.426
He can strip an engine

40:52.467 --> 40:54.929
and put it together again
in his sleep.

40:54.970 --> 40:59.225
He car repair anything
from an ocean liner to a sailboat.

40:59.308 --> 41:01.561
He'd he well worth his cut.

41:03.522 --> 41:05.941
Eric,
what would his cut be?

41:06.024 --> 41:07.443
Even shares all around.

41:07.526 --> 41:09.695
Isn't that what we decided?

41:09.737 --> 41:10.905
Sure, sure.

41:10.988 --> 41:13.282
But someJonny-Come-Lately greasemonkey

41:13.366 --> 41:14.701
who contributes
a screwdriver...

41:14.742 --> 41:18.246
How does he figure
to get a full share?

41:18.288 --> 41:19.873
Rosa, you know something,

41:19.957 --> 41:22.334
We start divvying this up
too many ways,

41:22.418 --> 41:23.878
that's going to shrink
the melon.

41:23.961 --> 41:26.214
If Eric says
he's needed,
he's s partner.

41:26.297 --> 41:29.259
He's a partner
if he wants to be a partner.

41:29.342 --> 41:32.763
I think we're taking
a little too much for granted, here.

41:32.846 --> 41:35.266
How do we know
he'll sit still for this?

41:35.349 --> 41:39.353
You'd be amazed
at what some people will sit still for.

41:39.395 --> 41:43.024
Mr Moreno and I
have been involved in several transactions.

41:43.108 --> 41:45.527
I've never known him
to fail me.

41:45.611 --> 41:48.113
Are you saying
you got something on Moreno?

41:48.197 --> 41:51.909
Maybe a little more
than he's got on me.

41:51.993 --> 41:53.953
At any rate,
his morality

41:54.037 --> 41:56.289
is as flexible
as ours.

41:56.373 --> 41:58.792
He is
what your navy calls

41:58.875 --> 42:00.919
"Dishonorably
Discharged".

42:02.087 --> 42:05.216
You think
you can locate this man?

42:05.299 --> 42:07.635
I'll start tomorrow.
It shouldn't be too difficult.

42:07.719 --> 42:09.179
Well, that settles that.

42:09.220 --> 42:11.640
Let's go ashore
and get some sleep.

42:11.682 --> 42:13.141
It's getting late.

42:13.225 --> 42:15.102
No. I'd like
a swim first.

42:15.144 --> 42:17.104
Well, now baby,
it's past midnight.

42:17.146 --> 42:19.607
Why don't we settle
for a hot bath?

42:19.691 --> 42:22.569
You got a bathing suit,
I got some towels below.

42:22.652 --> 42:25.614
I'm sure you do,
but the lady needs her sleep.

42:25.697 --> 42:28.617
Just so we don't
misunderstand each other, Brittain.

42:28.701 --> 42:30.578
We don't share
everything alike.

42:30.661 --> 42:34.123
What was owned before,
that's not in the pot.

42:34.207 --> 42:37.210
So we don't have anymisunderstandings--

42:37.294 --> 42:38.670
Nobody owns me.

42:38.754 --> 42:41.173
You have a few
prerogatives,
Victor,

42:41.256 --> 42:44.135
but that's a gift
from me to you.

42:44.218 --> 42:46.679
I can revoke
the license anytime.

42:46.763 --> 42:49.265
May I use
your cabin, please?

42:50.267 --> 42:51.268
Thank you.

42:53.812 --> 42:55.231
I'll go with you.

42:55.272 --> 42:58.734
The young lady can
swim her way back home.

42:59.986 --> 43:02.739
You step
on my toes a lot, Brittain.

43:02.781 --> 43:03.865
I'm unaccustomed.

43:05.075 --> 43:07.911
Cry a little baby,
so I'll know.

43:07.953 --> 43:09.455
You'll know,
believe it.

43:35.276 --> 43:37.695
You don't get out
of there,

43:37.778 --> 43:40.281
you're going to grow
a fin.

43:50.501 --> 43:53.171
Ahh...Brrr!

43:54.839 --> 43:56.258
Ever been
a masseur?

43:56.341 --> 43:58.760
No, but I
could kick myself.

43:58.844 --> 44:01.805
Linc, throw me that
that little jacket, will you?

44:04.225 --> 44:05.309
Thank you.

44:12.317 --> 44:15.195
Where'd you learn
to swim so good,

44:15.279 --> 44:18.199
diving for coins
in the Bay of Naples?

44:18.282 --> 44:21.202
I do everything
with perfection,
Mr. Brittain--

44:21.286 --> 44:22.662
Swimming, dancing,
fundraising,

44:22.746 --> 44:23.997
almost everything.

44:24.039 --> 44:25.207
And you?

44:25.248 --> 44:29.086
I play a little gin.
I catch a little fish.

44:29.170 --> 44:32.089
If I catch a lot
of fish,

44:32.173 --> 44:35.176
I get splendidly stoned.
It's a living.

44:36.303 --> 44:38.263
I think
I swim home now.

44:38.305 --> 44:40.265
Yes, but that's
only half way.

44:40.307 --> 44:42.268
When you get
on the shore,

44:42.309 --> 44:44.770
you have to walk
the rest of the way

44:44.812 --> 44:46.230
in a wet
bathing suit.

44:46.314 --> 44:48.775
Let me drive you
to the pier.

44:48.858 --> 44:51.862
I'll be there
before you can start
the engines.

45:19.309 --> 45:22.396
That isn't exactly
the Brooklyn navy yard.

45:23.481 --> 45:25.775
Mark, this is
Tony Moreno.

45:27.277 --> 45:29.821
He tells me
you're s shark with engines.

45:29.863 --> 45:31.531
Depends
on the engines.

45:32.783 --> 45:34.159
Where's the boat?

45:35.286 --> 45:36.746
Right in there.

45:56.810 --> 45:58.270
Are you serious?

45:58.353 --> 46:00.731
I didn't
say it was just
launched.

46:00.814 --> 46:03.693
You didn't say it came
out of a museum, either.

46:03.776 --> 46:06.320
I ain't seen one like this
in 20 years.

46:06.404 --> 46:07.822
It grows on you.

46:07.906 --> 46:10.325
I got enough
growing on me.

46:10.408 --> 46:11.827
When do I start?

46:11.910 --> 46:13.328
You've already started.

46:13.412 --> 46:15.039
Hey!

46:15.122 --> 46:18.334
Rossiter, Langley,
Miss Lucchesi,

46:18.417 --> 46:20.545
My old friend, Tony Moreno.

46:20.628 --> 46:21.588
Hello.

46:21.671 --> 46:23.340
HI. Charmed.

46:23.423 --> 46:24.591
<i> Italiana?</i>

46:24.674 --> 46:26.301
<i> Si, di Napoli.
Lei?</i>

46:26.426 --> 46:28.512
<i> Io sono diMilano.
Hmm, Bene.</i>

46:31.265 --> 46:33.685
Are you looking
for something special,

46:33.768 --> 46:35.979
or are you just browsing?

46:37.272 --> 46:39.233
You ever serves
on these?

46:39.316 --> 46:40.818
Only on the engines.

46:40.901 --> 46:44.196
Anybody go down
on one of these
is crazy.

46:44.238 --> 46:45.364
How about you?

46:45.406 --> 46:47.283
Submarines.

46:48.493 --> 46:49.452
Officer?

46:49.536 --> 46:51.121
Check.
Senior grade.

46:53.290 --> 46:54.750
Do I salute?

46:54.833 --> 46:56.752
Nope, not in this outfit,

46:56.836 --> 46:59.213
But we got
a chain of command.

46:59.297 --> 47:01.633
He gives the orders,
and we jump.

47:10.810 --> 47:13.688
Nice to have you
with us, Moreno.

47:14.773 --> 47:15.774
Yeah.

47:28.121 --> 47:30.665
What do you
think of him, Mark?

47:30.749 --> 47:33.669
How did you say
he got that D. D.?

47:33.710 --> 47:35.087
The discharge?

47:35.170 --> 47:37.381
He hit
the superior officer
with a wrench.

47:37.465 --> 47:38.925
Almost killed him.

47:39.008 --> 47:40.593
Is that all?
Ha!

47:40.677 --> 47:42.595

under pressure.

47:42.637 --> 47:44.431
Not too much pressure,

After all, what are we
asking him to do?

47:47.017 --> 47:49.228
Just to get

47:49.270 --> 47:51.731
so we can holdup
a liner.

Not too complicated.

01:14:54.556 --> 01:14:57.476
and I don't
need the argument.

01:14:57.518 --> 01:15:00.063
Why don't you
make your choice?

01:15:01.439 --> 01:15:02.941
I'm used to failure.

01:15:03.024 --> 01:15:04.901
I'm quite
philosophical
about it.

01:15:04.985 --> 01:15:07.404
But to lose
because two idiots

01:15:07.488 --> 01:15:08.948
share
the same passion

01:15:08.989 --> 01:15:11.492
and are willing
to kill over you.

01:15:11.576 --> 01:15:13.536
This I
can't live with!

01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:17.040
Do you likethe choice
made public now, Commander?

01:15:17.124 --> 01:15:20.461
You think that
this is the time?

01:15:20.502 --> 01:15:22.797
Rosa,
we owe you a lot,

01:15:22.838 --> 01:15:24.757
but tell
your two friends

01:15:24.841 --> 01:15:26.718
this is
the Atlantic ocean.

01:15:26.759 --> 01:15:28.720
It is adequate
for burials,

01:15:28.803 --> 01:15:32.015
but it is
no field of honor.

01:15:32.057 --> 01:15:35.019
If they want
to duel over you,

01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:37.855
tell them to wait
until I've satisfied
my passion!

01:15:37.897 --> 01:15:40.400
Running lights off
the starboard bow!

01:15:40.441 --> 01:15:41.943
Stand by to dive!

01:15:44.112 --> 01:15:45.155
Dive!

01:16:01.507 --> 01:16:04.427
A tanker.
A big, fat tanker.

01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:07.847
12,15 knots and
deep in the water.

01:16:14.521 --> 01:16:18.192
We could blow
her apart with
just one torpedo.

01:16:18.276 --> 01:16:22.113
Dead amidships.
Just one torpedo.

01:16:24.032 --> 01:16:25.492
That's your
pleasure, Eric,

01:16:25.534 --> 01:16:27.953
to sink a big,
fat, tanker?

01:16:28.037 --> 01:16:31.541
My training, Mark.
My instinct.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.978
Did you say 18, 36.4?

01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:51.480
Correct.

01:16:55.693 --> 01:16:57.445
Then that's it.

01:16:57.528 --> 01:17:00.448
Is that the end
of the line?

01:17:00.532 --> 01:17:01.908
Unless the sun lies

01:17:01.991 --> 01:17:05.579
and I've forgotten
my navigation, we're here.

01:17:05.662 --> 01:17:07.748
Tell Mark
stop the engines.

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:12.211
You know,
I'm going to get you

01:17:12.253 --> 01:17:14.672
a big, big
brother--Yeah!

01:17:16.675 --> 01:17:19.803
[WHISTLING]

01:17:19.887 --> 01:17:21.472
We're here, Linc.

01:17:21.472 --> 01:17:23.933
<i>Rosa,
get the uniforms
ready, Subito.</i>

01:17:25.518 --> 01:17:28.480
We're ready to submerge
in about an hour.

01:17:28.521 --> 01:17:29.814
Make it longer.

01:17:29.898 --> 01:17:31.650
Those batteries
can't last forever.

01:17:31.692 --> 01:17:33.402
We've
a long trip back.

01:17:33.485 --> 01:17:35.946
From now on,
keep changing bands.

01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:38.616
You're bound to pick up
her transmissions

01:17:38.699 --> 01:17:40.118
or messages to her.

01:17:40.201 --> 01:17:43.163
She can't be
too far away from us now.

01:17:52.090 --> 01:17:53.508
This the one?

01:17:53.591 --> 01:17:55.510
50 pounds
of flash powder,

01:17:55.593 --> 01:17:59.431
but she'll make
as much noise as
the atomic bomb.

01:17:59.515 --> 01:18:02.476
Be sure she runs shallow
so everybody sees her.

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:05.605
I can't wait
to see their faces
when this hits.

01:18:05.688 --> 01:18:07.106
Never mind their faces.

01:18:07.190 --> 01:18:09.985
Just make sure
our watches synchronize
with Tony's.

01:18:10.068 --> 01:18:12.529
Two minutes after
we reach the bridge,

01:18:12.571 --> 01:18:14.031
He'll fire this torpedo.

01:18:14.114 --> 01:18:16.867
[LINC] I'm getting her
loud and clear!

01:18:19.829 --> 01:18:21.831
<i> HMS Trident,

01:18:21.915 --> 01:18:23.291

<i> HMS Trident,

01:18:25.544 --> 01:18:27.463
<i>calling Queen Mary.</i>

01:18:27.546 --> 01:18:31.175
Please reply
with an extremely
low-strength signal.

01:18:31.217 --> 01:18:33.845
We're on a secret
mission here.

01:18:33.887 --> 01:18:36.514
<i> HMS Trident
Calling Queen Mary.</i>

01:18:36.598 --> 01:18:37.933
Aha.

01:18:41.186 --> 01:18:43.940
<i>Gentlemen, the Queen.</i>

01:18:44.023 --> 01:18:47.026
Gentlemen, we're in
the wrong clothing.

<i>HMS Trident

01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:03.169
We do not wish
our presence revealed.

01:19:03.253 --> 01:19:04.796
This is important.

01:19:04.838 --> 01:19:08.259
We urge that you
call your captain
before replying.

01:19:08.342 --> 01:19:13.222
Repeat--Urge calling your
captain before replying.

01:19:13.264 --> 01:19:14.557
Get the Captain.

01:19:14.641 --> 01:19:18.312
<i>HMS Trident

01:19:18.395 --> 01:19:21.398
Get the Captain. Urgent!

<i> HMS Trident

01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:28.823
We're a British submarine
on a secret mission.

01:19:32.828 --> 01:19:35.247
<i>This is the Captain
of the Queen Mary.</i>

01:19:35.331 --> 01:19:37.708
Who are you?
Your name and rank,
please.

01:19:37.792 --> 01:19:39.210
Low-strength signal!

01:19:39.293 --> 01:19:40.795
They're playing along!

01:19:46.385 --> 01:19:48.345
This is Commander
Cunningham, Sir.

01:19:48.387 --> 01:19:51.015
<i>Commanding
the British submarine
Trident.</i>

01:19:51.057 --> 01:19:52.600
We're an experimental
submarine

01:19:52.642 --> 01:19:57.022
on a secret mission
on these waters
under Admiralty orders.

01:19:57.105 --> 01:19:59.942
One of our main
engines has
broken down, Sir.

01:19:59.983 --> 01:20:01.485
We need a part

01:20:01.527 --> 01:20:03.988
Which we believe
your engineers
can supply.

01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:07.242
I urgently request
permission to board, Sir.

01:20:07.325 --> 01:20:08.326
Board?

01:20:09.536 --> 01:20:11.913
You're asking me
to stop my ship?

01:20:11.997 --> 01:20:13.832
I'm afraid I must,
Sir.

01:20:13.874 --> 01:20:18.087
I cannot overemphasize
the importance of
my mission, Captain.

01:20:18.171 --> 01:20:21.382
It is absolutelyimperative that
we have help, Sir,

01:20:21.424 --> 01:20:23.969
and equally imperative
that we have it secretly

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:25.429
from a British ship.

01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:28.432
We've been waiting
on your course
for three days,

01:20:28.474 --> 01:20:30.977
submerging at sight
of other ships.

01:20:31.018 --> 01:20:32.437
We will delay you

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:34.647
No longer than 20 minutes
at the most.

01:20:34.731 --> 01:20:39.194
We are on Admiralty orders
and request permission
to board, Sir.

01:20:39.278 --> 01:20:42.531
Very well, Commander,
But you'd better know
what you're doing.

01:20:42.573 --> 01:20:44.992
We'll stop
and lend assistance
if we can,

01:20:45.034 --> 01:20:47.537
but this
will be reported
to the Admiralty

01:20:47.579 --> 01:20:49.623
as soon as we dock.

01:20:49.706 --> 01:20:52.876
Of course, Sir,
and I'm deeply grateful.

01:20:52.918 --> 01:20:57.089
May I further request
radio silence concerning
our presence here?

01:20:57.173 --> 01:20:59.425
We do not wish
to interfere

01:20:59.467 --> 01:21:01.344
with your normal
transmissions, Captain,

01:21:01.469 --> 01:21:03.430
but you will request
your operators

01:21:03.471 --> 01:21:05.933
to refrain from mentioning
our presence here.

01:21:06.016 --> 01:21:07.977
I have already
done so, Commander.

01:21:08.018 --> 01:21:10.479
Do you have
a small boat
you can board?

01:21:10.563 --> 01:21:12.982
Yes, Sir,
we have a raft.

01:21:13.024 --> 01:21:14.442
Our chief engineer
and two officers

01:21:14.526 --> 01:21:16.945
will set out
immediately.

01:21:17.028 --> 01:21:18.488
See that you do.

01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:19.948
Gentlemen...
Mr. Lawrence.

01:21:20.032 --> 01:21:20.991
Sir?

01:21:21.033 --> 01:21:22.493
All engines
full astern.

01:21:22.535 --> 01:21:24.954
Mr. Porter,
go down to "R" Deck

01:21:25.037 --> 01:21:27.457
and escort
the boarding party
to the bridge.

01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:28.541
Mr. Stewart.

01:21:34.632 --> 01:21:37.510
Tony, Linc will help you
load the torpedo.

01:21:37.593 --> 01:21:38.970
Remember,
no mistakes.

01:21:39.053 --> 01:21:40.513
She's preset
and aimed.

01:21:40.597 --> 01:21:42.015
Don't fiddle
with the mechanism.

01:21:42.057 --> 01:21:43.058
Come on.

01:21:46.770 --> 01:21:47.688
Be careful.

01:21:47.771 --> 01:21:49.231
Please.

01:21:49.273 --> 01:21:53.736
Miss Lucchsi...
why the hell didn't you stay in Naples?

01:22:17.889 --> 01:22:18.848
Let's go.

01:22:57.558 --> 01:22:59.644
Easy, easy.

01:22:59.727 --> 01:23:00.687
Good.

01:23:46.572 --> 01:23:47.990
This elevator,
gentlemen.

01:23:48.073 --> 01:23:49.074
Thank you.

01:23:57.167 --> 01:23:58.627
Where to, Sir?

01:23:58.710 --> 01:24:00.129
Sun deck, please.

01:24:00.212 --> 01:24:01.630
Very good, Sir.

01:24:01.714 --> 01:24:03.090
Sorry abut
the delay.

01:24:03.174 --> 01:24:04.634
That's quite
all right.

01:24:04.717 --> 01:24:06.970
I hope we have
just what you need.

01:24:07.053 --> 01:24:09.556
I'm sure you do.
Thank you.

01:24:11.558 --> 01:24:13.894
They're on
a boat deck.

01:24:27.242 --> 01:24:29.203
Commander Cunningham
presents his compliments

01:24:29.286 --> 01:24:31.956
and wishes to express
his sincere thanks.

01:24:31.998 --> 01:24:34.000
Thank you,
your name, Sir?

01:24:34.042 --> 01:24:36.503
Lieutenant Follett, Sir,
and we're extrem--

01:24:36.545 --> 01:24:38.005
We're extremely
grateful.

01:24:38.046 --> 01:24:39.214
Ahem.

01:24:39.298 --> 01:24:40.466
<i> Lieutenant Follett,
is it?</i>

01:24:40.549 --> 01:24:42.009
That's right, Sir.

01:24:42.051 --> 01:24:44.053
and are you
a British sub?

01:24:44.095 --> 01:24:46.264
<i>That's correct, Sir.
HMS Trident.</i>

01:24:48.933 --> 01:24:50.310
You're Canadian,
aren't you?

01:24:50.393 --> 01:24:51.853
Why, yes, Sir.

01:24:51.937 --> 01:24:54.356
I'm surprised
you could still tell, Sir.

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:57.735
I've been in
the Royal Navy just
under four years now.

01:24:57.818 --> 01:25:01.072
I see. Now about
this part you need,
Leftenant,

01:25:01.156 --> 01:25:04.076
I hope it won't
delay us too long.

01:25:04.159 --> 01:25:06.119
No, of course not, Sir.

01:25:06.203 --> 01:25:09.874
Captain, I wonder
if we might speak
with you, privately?

01:25:09.915 --> 01:25:10.917
Our mission...

01:25:13.127 --> 01:25:14.754
This way, please...

01:25:14.838 --> 01:25:15.839
Thank you.

01:25:21.637 --> 01:25:24.056
Now, what can I do
for you, gentlemen?

01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:26.059
I have a schedule
to meet.

01:25:26.142 --> 01:25:28.061
Would you
kindly read this?

01:25:28.144 --> 01:25:29.521
"Maintain normal
radio transmission."

01:25:29.604 --> 01:25:33.734
"Make announcement to pacify passengers and crew."

01:25:33.817 --> 01:25:35.569
"Lower a ship's boat."

01:25:35.653 --> 01:25:38.614
"Do not interfere
with us in any way."

01:25:41.659 --> 01:25:44.121
"Open the bank
and bullion room"?

01:25:44.162 --> 01:25:45.289
Mm-hm.

01:25:45.330 --> 01:25:47.583
Do you intend
to rob this ship?

01:25:47.625 --> 01:25:48.626
Exactly.

01:25:51.504 --> 01:25:52.964
Are you insane?

01:25:53.006 --> 01:25:55.091
If you'll
just follow
the instructions--

01:25:55.175 --> 01:25:56.092
Now, Eric.

01:26:01.765 --> 01:26:04.227
Captain, will you look
to our submarine?

01:26:15.114 --> 01:26:17.909
That was a dummy
torpedo, Captain.

01:26:17.950 --> 01:26:20.453
The rest of them
are live.

01:26:24.624 --> 01:26:26.084
I don't believe you.

01:26:26.168 --> 01:26:28.546
Sink this ship,
and you sink with her.

01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:30.548
That's true.
You've read our instructions.

01:26:30.631 --> 01:26:32.550
If you don't
follow them,

01:26:32.592 --> 01:26:34.594
I advise you
to abandon ship.

01:26:41.435 --> 01:26:42.436
Gentlemen.

01:26:50.695 --> 01:26:51.613
Mr. Lobley?

01:26:51.655 --> 01:26:52.906
Sir?

01:26:52.948 --> 01:26:55.075
Attend to the radio
as per instructions.

01:26:55.117 --> 01:26:56.077
Yes, Sir.

01:26:56.118 --> 01:26:56.952
Mr. Long?

01:26:57.036 --> 01:26:57.995
Sir.

01:26:58.079 --> 01:26:59.497
Make the necessary
announcement.

01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:00.540
Yes, Sir.

01:27:01.875 --> 01:27:04.503
And, Captain, if you'll
please detail someone

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:07.798
To take three rather
large empty sacks
to the bank.

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.009
Makeit an order
with no explanation. Hmm?

01:27:10.051 --> 01:27:11.844
You're out
of your minds.

01:27:11.886 --> 01:27:14.138
You're completely
out of your minds.

01:27:14.222 --> 01:27:15.682
