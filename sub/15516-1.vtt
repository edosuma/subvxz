WEBVTT

00:27.152 --> 00:29.322
Come back!

00:29.404 --> 00:31.114
Wait up!

00:34.117 --> 00:35.697
What a beautiful day.

00:35.785 --> 00:37.535
Good morning!

01:25.251 --> 01:27.801
There's music in the marketplace

01:27.837 --> 01:30.547
The streets have come alive

01:30.632 --> 01:35.342
The town is in a tizzy
It's a busy buzzing hive

01:35.428 --> 01:39.848
There's cause for this commotion
And emotional display

01:39.974 --> 01:45.774
We just can't wait to celebrate
Our favorite holiday

01:46.022 --> 01:50.232
Le Jour D'Amour
Your song is in the air

01:50.318 --> 01:54.818
What magic will you make for us?
What promise will you share?

01:54.864 --> 01:59.874
That golden bell, sweet La Fidèle
Will soon be ringing clear

02:00.370 --> 02:04.460
The best of all the festivals
Le Jour D'Amour is here

02:04.707 --> 02:07.917
Mesdames et messieurs,
time is short!

02:08.002 --> 02:10.301
You must find your true love.

02:10.380 --> 02:16.390
Find your soul's mate,
for the festival d'amour is upon us.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.097
Some have come in puppy love

02:22.183 --> 02:24.063
Perchance to steal a kiss

02:24.102 --> 02:27.902
Some are still enamored
After years of wedded bliss

02:27.939 --> 02:31.399
Everyone's parading
down the promenade in pairs

02:31.484 --> 02:35.034
To join the celebration
Of the finest of the fairs

02:35.071 --> 02:38.571
Le Jour D'Amour
Your song is in the air

02:38.616 --> 02:42.236
What magic will you make for us?
Whose name shall l declare?

02:42.287 --> 02:46.867
That golden bell, sweet La Fidèle
Will soon be ringing clear

02:46.916 --> 02:50.416
The best of all the festivals
Le Jour D'Amour is here

02:50.587 --> 02:54.087
How the stars will sparkle on the water

02:54.174 --> 02:57.594
As the troubadours sing
Tales of true romance

02:57.635 --> 03:00.595
The spirits may rise

03:01.264 --> 03:04.434
With fire in their eyes

03:04.934 --> 03:07.944
While gypsy girls
Enchant you with a dance

03:07.979 --> 03:08.979
Ho, ho, ho!

03:14.444 --> 03:17.994
Le Jour D'Amour
Your song is in the air

03:18.072 --> 03:21.622
What magic will you make for us?
What promise will you share?

03:21.701 --> 03:27.961
That golden bell, sweet La Fidèle
Will soon be ringing clear

03:28.124 --> 03:33.964
The best of all the festivals
Le Jour D'Amour is here

03:40.220 --> 03:41.680
Ha, ha, ha!

03:47.310 --> 03:52.020
Ah, observe the rituals of courtship
as citizens gather two by two.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.859
Looks like there's someone
for everyone.

03:55.944 --> 03:56.944
Ah, yes.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.993
Too bad there's only one of me
to go around.

04:00.865 --> 04:03.365
Ha! One is plenty. Believe me.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.834
Ah, thanks. Hey.

04:06.287 --> 04:07.827
Was that a shot?

04:07.914 --> 04:09.004
Maybe.

04:09.165 --> 04:10.285
Take that back!

04:10.500 --> 04:11.500
No!

04:11.584 --> 04:13.094
Take that...

04:13.711 --> 04:14.751
Back.

04:18.632 --> 04:21.683
Are you guys gonna fight all day
or help me get ready for the festival?

04:22.011 --> 04:24.511
There he is in his triumphant return.

04:24.722 --> 04:26.522
Dashing gadabout town.

04:26.891 --> 04:30.941
Come on. Let's get the marble out,
we have to polish La Fidèle.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.692
And what's the festival...

04:32.772 --> 04:34.152
Without the bell?

04:34.190 --> 04:36.690
Or the bell-ringer!

04:45.326 --> 04:47.286
Charge!

05:08.933 --> 05:11.063
Zephyr, you need to slow down.

05:12.228 --> 05:15.808
Okay,

05:15.898 --> 05:17.568
Mom.

05:17.650 --> 05:18.690
Ha, ha, ha.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.735
Listen to your mother, young man.

05:20.778 --> 05:21.948
Yes, Papa.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.779
Look at her.

05:28.953 --> 05:31.373
La Fidèle, you are magnificent.

05:31.706 --> 05:33.866
Are you gonna ring it
once for my mom, Quasi?

05:34.083 --> 05:36.503
You bet he is, and your mother's
gonna be down in the square

05:36.586 --> 05:38.336
screaming loudly into the night,

05:38.463 --> 05:42.013
"I love my husband, Phoebus."

05:42.425 --> 05:43.425
Really?

05:43.801 --> 05:46.181
And what makes you think
that I'm gonna shout so loudly?

05:46.304 --> 05:48.764
You'll have to,
to be heard over me yelling,

05:48.806 --> 05:52.306
"I love Esmeralda!"

05:55.021 --> 05:56.151
Yuck.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.937
Yeah. Yuck.

06:05.114 --> 06:07.284
Whose name are you
gonna yell tomorrow, Quasi?

06:08.326 --> 06:10.326
No one, I guess.

06:10.411 --> 06:11.951
Then who's gonna scream your name?

06:13.289 --> 06:16.329
I don't think anyone ever will, Zephyr.

06:19.003 --> 06:21.383
Well, why not?

06:27.929 --> 06:29.219
Quasi.

06:31.682 --> 06:35.942
Takes more than looking to really see.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.940
Someday you'll be ready.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.572
And when you are, you'll find her.

06:49.492 --> 06:50.782
Someday.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.160
Nah.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.330
What could possibly ever change?

07:00.002 --> 07:02.672
Boy, wow! It's the circus.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.052
Look!

07:12.181 --> 07:14.021
Look at the monkey!

07:15.309 --> 07:17.389
Come, mes amis!

07:17.478 --> 07:23.018
As part of the festival d'amour,
a circus has come to Paris!

07:27.363 --> 07:29.913
Come one, come all.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.241
To Cirque de Sarousch!

07:32.326 --> 07:34.736
See juggling clowns,

07:34.829 --> 07:36.539
fire-breathers,

07:36.622 --> 07:38.462
and magic.

07:41.294 --> 07:45.554
And now, may I present
the prettiest ornament on the midway...

07:46.549 --> 07:47.969
I can't see!

07:49.177 --> 07:50.547
My assistant...

07:53.681 --> 07:54.891
Um, heh, well...

07:55.766 --> 07:57.676
My assistant...

07:58.144 --> 07:59.234
It's empty.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.940
There's no one there.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.442
Well, of course not!

08:02.982 --> 08:05.532
You have to come to the circus
to see her.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.199
Where is Madellaine?

08:11.532 --> 08:12.702
And pull!

08:13.326 --> 08:15.536
Mesdames and messieurs,

08:15.578 --> 08:21.038
kindly direct your attention high above,
as the magnificent Madellaine

08:21.083 --> 08:23.753
is about to perform
her daring high-wire act

08:24.420 --> 08:26.420
without a net. Oops.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.722
And the crowd goes wild.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.341
Ahhh! Ahhh!

08:31.886 --> 08:35.716
A hush comes over the crowd
as Madellaine begins her graceful trek.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.135
Ooh, ooh.

08:37.265 --> 08:38.596
Whoo, whoo.

08:40.770 --> 08:41.770
Whew.

08:42.270 --> 08:47.441
Madellaine catches her breath,
having nearly plummeted to her death.

08:47.485 --> 08:50.445
And the crowd bursts into applause.
Ahh!

08:50.655 --> 08:52.735
As they scream for more.

08:52.907 --> 08:53.947
Encore!

08:53.991 --> 08:56.451
Thank you. You're too kind.

08:57.745 --> 09:00.035
Where were you,
my little trinket?

09:01.707 --> 09:04.207
Well, I was standing.

09:05.294 --> 09:08.134
Well, of course, I was standing.
I mean, I haven't always been sitting.

09:08.214 --> 09:11.134
That would be stupid, I guess.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.128
I'm sorry.

09:15.012 --> 09:17.642
I just want to contribute more
to the circus.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.637
Yourjob is to stand there
and look pretty.

09:21.435 --> 09:22.635
Hello.

09:24.188 --> 09:25.308
Lovely.

09:25.356 --> 09:26.566
I want to do more.

09:26.649 --> 09:29.729
And so you shall, my little éclair.

09:29.944 --> 09:33.744
I have the perfect job for a girl like you.

09:35.616 --> 09:40.496
Up in the tower of Notre Dame
is a bell of extraordinary value.

09:40.955 --> 09:44.915
I want you to go up there and find out
which is the bell called La Fidèle.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.754
Why?

09:48.004 --> 09:50.014
Because I mean to steal it, silly.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.512
I'll be rich.

09:51.632 --> 09:54.842
I can travel the world
in style and comfort.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.135
No.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.385
Why must we always steal?

09:58.472 --> 09:59.512
I was thinking...

10:00.057 --> 10:01.677
Thinking?

10:01.726 --> 10:05.186
Not your strong suit, is it,
my little bonbon?

10:05.855 --> 10:07.685
No, it's mine.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.070
And where would you be without me?

10:10.359 --> 10:12.739
- On the streets.
- Precisely.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.364
For it's a cold world out there...

10:15.489 --> 10:16.949
For a girl like me.

10:17.366 --> 10:19.156
What do I do?

10:20.328 --> 10:21.538
Lovely.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.749
There's a bell-ringer
that lives in the tower.

10:27.084 --> 10:30.254
Smile at him, wile and beguile him,

10:30.504 --> 10:33.884
and he'll tell you
exactly what I want to know.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.019
Hello?

11:30.147 --> 11:31.307
Damsel alert.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.439
And a lovely vision at that.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.736
What am I, chopped liver?

11:35.861 --> 11:37.861
I'm looking for the bell-ringer.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.074
She wants you, big guy.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.580
Is anyone here?

11:47.790 --> 11:49.330
Get out there, sweetie.

11:49.583 --> 11:50.923
I can't.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.125
What would I say?

11:52.211 --> 11:54.381
Open your mouth.
Something will come out.

11:54.880 --> 11:55.960
I...

11:56.048 --> 11:57.128
Nothing came out.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.804
My name is Madellaine.

11:59.093 --> 12:03.643
I'm with the circus, and I just love bells.

12:04.765 --> 12:07.475
Which one is La Fidèle?

12:07.643 --> 12:10.853
The bells, you ding-dong,
she likes the bells.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.403
Talk shop.

12:14.692 --> 12:17.652
Are you hiding from me?

12:21.073 --> 12:22.993
No. What's so funny?

12:23.159 --> 12:24.489
Nothing. It's just...

12:24.827 --> 12:26.657
It looks like you're wearing
a really big hat.

12:29.540 --> 12:32.170
That sounds silly, doesn't it?

12:32.293 --> 12:35.923
No, I just never
looked at it that way before.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.339
Yes, it's a brass beret.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.428
A two-ton topper.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.182
A chapeau in C-sharp.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.649
The gargoyles!

12:55.274 --> 12:56.574
Gargoyles?

12:57.109 --> 12:59.189
They were alive!

13:01.739 --> 13:03.359
But that's dumb, isn't it?

13:04.658 --> 13:06.028
No.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.415
You must think I'm stupid.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.344
Not at all.

13:20.382 --> 13:22.382
That just means
you have an imagination.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.048
Do you really think so?

13:24.386 --> 13:25.636
I do.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.434
What's your name?

13:31.143 --> 13:32.313
Quasimodo.

13:32.603 --> 13:35.363
Well, Quasimodo,

13:36.232 --> 13:38.442
wouldn't you like to come
where I can see you?

13:53.874 --> 13:56.334
I have to go.

13:56.418 --> 13:57.958
I'm sorry.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.112
Oh, poor kid.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.583
Are you okay?

14:35.875 --> 14:39.455
No. You saw the way she looked at me.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.258
Well, then, get her to look again, honey.

14:50.639 --> 14:52.349
Do you believe in miracles?

14:52.558 --> 14:55.228
Miracles? What kind of miracles?

14:55.811 --> 14:58.191
You know, just ordinary miracles.

14:58.522 --> 15:00.362
I'm not following you, kid.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.936
I see people together, couples,

15:05.779 --> 15:07.199
and it looks so nice,

15:07.656 --> 15:09.446
being with someone who loves you.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.291
I guess I'm just wondering if

15:13.704 --> 15:16.464
maybe someone could love me.

15:18.334 --> 15:24.344
Imagine someone to love
Who loves you

15:26.008 --> 15:32.308
lmagine to look in her eyes and see

15:33.515 --> 15:38.515
lmagine how miraculous it seems to be

15:41.106 --> 15:44.776
But it's not so very rare

15:44.944 --> 15:48.704
You can find it anywhere

15:50.074 --> 15:53.334
lt's an ordinary miracle

15:54.244 --> 15:58.044
The kind you find
around you every single day

15:58.207 --> 16:02.247
Or maybe it's just seasonal
Like spring and May

16:02.544 --> 16:05.384
They're so many

16:06.215 --> 16:09.005
The ordinary miracle

16:10.135 --> 16:14.005
A common kind of miracle
That runs right by

16:14.098 --> 16:18.058
Or maybe it's too gradual
To catch your eye

16:18.352 --> 16:20.772
So you miss it

16:22.898 --> 16:26.278
A sudden bolt of distant lightning

16:26.735 --> 16:30.405
Cathedrals rising out of stone

16:30.447 --> 16:34.367
A baby starts
To walk or talk one day

16:34.493 --> 16:37.413
Then shockingly he's grown

16:37.454 --> 16:40.874
And in love

16:40.916 --> 16:44.246
That volcano of emotion

16:44.294 --> 16:50.224
Not 10,000 gypsy potions
Can undo

16:50.426 --> 16:54.096
Yes, it's love

16:54.138 --> 16:57.138
Well, of course my view is slanted

16:57.224 --> 17:00.394
But people do take love for granted

17:00.728 --> 17:04.108
Sad but true

17:04.397 --> 17:06.978
Of all the many miracles

17:08.444 --> 17:12.784
Mysterious and marvelous
And big and small

17:12.865 --> 17:16.944
When people fall in love
lt really beats them all

17:18.119 --> 17:19.660
To see it

17:19.747 --> 17:21.367
To feel it

17:21.623 --> 17:25.713
To know it

17:25.794 --> 17:31.674
lmagine someone to love
Who loves you

17:33.302 --> 17:39.972
lmagine to look in her eyes and see

17:40.684 --> 17:46.314
lmagine how extraordinary
lt would be

17:48.317 --> 17:52.147
lf an ordinary miracle

17:53.238 --> 17:59.328
happened to me

18:16.011 --> 18:18.101
Go to the circus.
Make a good impression.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.097
Hmm. What does one wear
to a carnival event?

18:21.183 --> 18:23.603
- Nothing.
- Daring! Ho, ho!

18:24.394 --> 18:26.564
Maybe a bit pushy for a first date.

18:26.980 --> 18:30.020
Quasi, you can stay here
and hope for a miracle,

18:30.275 --> 18:33.945
or you can get out there
and make a miracle of your own.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.579
You're right.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.370
I'm off to the circus.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.380
But what am I gonna wear?

18:48.585 --> 18:50.995
I got the perfect thing, kid.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.599
Well, how do I look?

19:05.394 --> 19:06.524
Uh...

19:06.562 --> 19:07.852
Too much?

19:09.356 --> 19:11.646
- Uh... No, no.
- Of course not.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.613
- It's a new you.
- Wow! Great hat, Quasi.

19:13.694 --> 19:16.074
Quasi, don't worry. You look dashing.

19:16.655 --> 19:20.235
Welcome, welcome,
to the Cirque de Sarousch.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.579
Magic! Magic!

19:22.911 --> 19:26.251
- Tricks that you cannot ever dream of!
- Look at the juggler!

19:32.629 --> 19:34.959
Come one, come all!

19:37.801 --> 19:38.931
Oh, wow!

19:42.848 --> 19:43.848
Wow!

19:44.141 --> 19:45.641
Zephyr, stay close.

19:46.101 --> 19:47.391
I don't want to lose you.

19:47.603 --> 19:48.773
I don't trust these people.

19:48.854 --> 19:49.944
What does that mean?

19:50.022 --> 19:51.152
Well, just look at them.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.521
I mean,
they travel from town to town like...

19:53.775 --> 19:55.525
- Gypsies?
- Yes! No!

19:55.652 --> 19:57.152
I mean...

19:58.405 --> 20:00.655
Uh, so, Quasi, um,

20:01.241 --> 20:03.031
where's this Madellaine of yours?

20:03.702 --> 20:05.042
I don't know.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.117
But I'm sure she'll be out soon.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.575
You don't understand.
You didn't see him.

20:11.501 --> 20:13.421
I don't want to be a part of this anymore.

20:13.462 --> 20:16.762
You should have thought of that
before you stole from me.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.590
But I was only six years old.

20:18.842 --> 20:22.852
And you were starving,
and it was only a few coins.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.430
You cretin, not so tight.

20:25.641 --> 20:26.641
I made a mistake.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.350
Yes.

20:29.102 --> 20:31.812
And did I turn you over
to the authorities?

20:31.980 --> 20:32.980
No.

20:34.149 --> 20:36.229
Or the workhouse?

20:36.944 --> 20:37.994
No.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.650
And who took you in?

20:40.739 --> 20:42.819
Looked after you like a true friend?

20:43.033 --> 20:44.123
You did.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.160
Yes.

20:46.495 --> 20:49.325
All you need to do
is to look pretty for him,

20:49.748 --> 20:51.998
and he'll tell you what I need to know.

20:55.879 --> 20:57.169
Mirrors!

21:06.848 --> 21:08.848
I could kiss me,

21:09.142 --> 21:10.692
but I'd fall in love.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.613
Come, trinket.

21:15.691 --> 21:16.731
We're on.

22:04.281 --> 22:05.571
Messieurs et dames!

22:05.907 --> 22:07.367
Boys and girls.

22:07.743 --> 22:08.993
Voilà.

22:09.411 --> 22:11.501
A treat for your senses.

22:12.039 --> 22:14.829
A delight for your soul.

22:16.877 --> 22:17.877
Wow!

22:17.919 --> 22:18.919
Yeah!

22:19.004 --> 22:22.924
Welcome to Cirque de Sarousch.

22:26.928 --> 22:27.968
Hubba! Hubba!

22:28.638 --> 22:32.598
May I present my assistant,
the lovely Madellaine.

22:42.319 --> 22:45.819
And now, I will astound you
with a feat of magic

22:45.906 --> 22:48.276
unparalleled in modern times.

22:48.658 --> 22:51.828
Behold la petite!

23:03.382 --> 23:07.222
Messieurs et dames,
do not look away from the beast,

23:07.552 --> 23:12.312
for I shall make it vanish
before your very eyes.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.314
Keep a sharp watch.

23:15.727 --> 23:19.857
See the creature
disappear into thin air.

23:23.985 --> 23:27.445
Adve mysterium, obscuro elephantom.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.405
Mirabelay visu.

23:30.575 --> 23:32.985
Exepo facto!

23:35.664 --> 23:36.964
Yeah!

23:46.341 --> 23:49.341
Wow, wow, wow!

23:49.594 --> 23:51.144
Sarousch is incredible!

23:51.179 --> 23:53.059
I wish I could join a circus.

23:53.181 --> 23:55.221
Hey. Maybe I could join a circus.

23:55.308 --> 23:57.138
Yeah! I could be a juggler.

23:57.185 --> 23:59.515
What do you think, Quasi?
I'd juggle, and I'd...

24:00.021 --> 24:01.401
Quasi? Uh...

24:01.606 --> 24:02.726
Uh...

24:03.483 --> 24:04.783
Quasi?

24:06.862 --> 24:09.242
- Hello?
- What are you doing?

24:09.322 --> 24:10.362
Nothing.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.867
You were making goo-goo eyes
at your girlfriend.

24:13.952 --> 24:15.202
She's not my...

24:15.287 --> 24:17.247
Who said she was my... That's a...

24:18.081 --> 24:19.671
Zephyr.

24:26.006 --> 24:27.836
And where do you think you're going?

24:27.883 --> 24:29.133
Get out there.

24:29.593 --> 24:32.393
I mean to have that bell.

24:35.765 --> 24:37.595
I thought you forgot about me.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.311
That will never happen.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.097
I'll always be here for you.

24:42.189 --> 24:43.229
Always?

24:44.107 --> 24:45.267
Always.

24:47.527 --> 24:49.607
You mean ifever

24:49.696 --> 24:52.736
l'm in any kind of
Great big mess or trouble

24:53.241 --> 24:55.121
l'd be right there

24:55.577 --> 24:57.617
We'd be a pair

24:58.330 --> 25:00.460
You mean you'll never
Leave me all alone

25:00.540 --> 25:03.080
We'll always be A double, we two

25:04.211 --> 25:07.921
That's the arithmetic
l'd stick with you

25:08.340 --> 25:12.890
Just say we're hanging by a rope
Above an evil witch's brew pot

25:13.303 --> 25:15.393
lt's bubbling blue

25:15.722 --> 25:17.522
With sticky goo

25:18.266 --> 25:19.476
Our rope gives way

25:19.559 --> 25:21.189
And then we crash
And make a splash

25:21.269 --> 25:23.519
lnside her stew pot of glue

25:24.064 --> 25:28.114
Even if you're sticky slick
l'd stick with you

25:28.818 --> 25:30.318
I'm sticking to you.

25:30.445 --> 25:31.645
No fair.

25:31.821 --> 25:33.361
Can't help that.

25:34.115 --> 25:35.695
We're stuck together.

25:37.410 --> 25:38.950
Best friends.

25:39.329 --> 25:40.869
And we always will be.

25:41.456 --> 25:42.866
Always.

26:00.767 --> 26:03.767
Through all the thin and thick

26:04.479 --> 26:07.519
Closer than Frack and Frick

26:08.066 --> 26:10.106
We two will do the trick

26:10.318 --> 26:14.148
l'd stick with you

26:15.490 --> 26:18.160
Fast as the clock can tick

26:19.244 --> 26:21.834
l'd be there just as quick

26:22.956 --> 26:25.456
No one I'd rather pick

26:25.750 --> 26:32.130
l'd stick with you

26:36.845 --> 26:38.255
Zephyr.

26:42.684 --> 26:43.854
You have a way with kids.

26:43.893 --> 26:45.853
Hi, Madellaine, hi.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.517
I was just...

26:47.564 --> 26:48.694
Hi.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.861
He's lucky to have
a good friend like you.

26:54.321 --> 26:55.361
Hey.

26:55.405 --> 26:57.355
You were really great up there.

26:57.907 --> 26:58.987
Me?

26:59.034 --> 27:02.124
Nothing to it. I just have to stand there
and look pretty, you know?

27:02.203 --> 27:04.003
La de dum, ho de do

27:04.039 --> 27:05.079
No big deal.

27:05.165 --> 27:07.285
No, no, it is a big deal.

27:07.375 --> 27:09.775
You have to make the audience look
where they're supposed to,

27:09.836 --> 27:11.496
not give away the trick.

27:11.630 --> 27:12.670
Hmm.

27:12.714 --> 27:15.924
You mean, hocus their pocus?

27:16.551 --> 27:18.681
Delusion their illusion?

27:20.889 --> 27:22.469
Abra their cadabra?

27:24.893 --> 27:26.193
Actually,

27:27.437 --> 27:29.807
I would really like to walk the tightrope.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.068
Oh.

27:31.107 --> 27:33.357
But I'm not really very good at it.

27:33.568 --> 27:35.488
Oh, I don't believe that.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.914
I'm sure you can do anything.

27:44.287 --> 27:46.867
Paris is really pretty.

27:46.915 --> 27:51.585
I mean, you've probably seen it already,
but then, maybe you haven't.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.460
And if you haven't,
then maybe we could...

27:54.714 --> 27:58.434
I could, you know, show you.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.337
I'd really like that.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.605
Oh, lovely.

28:24.411 --> 28:28.581
I love you, love you, love you, and you.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.999
You're a genius.

28:33.837 --> 28:36.127
Captain of the guard,
I insist you do something.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.093
They took my silver!

28:38.174 --> 28:40.934
All my coins to pay my landlord.
They'll throw us out!

28:40.969 --> 28:43.049
- My bracelet.
- Can you describe the bracelet?

28:43.138 --> 28:44.218
My life savings!

28:44.305 --> 28:45.715
All right, have no worry.

28:45.807 --> 28:47.847
The king's guard is on the case.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.143
We'll find the culprits.

28:51.312 --> 28:53.562
Where we'll find them, I don't know.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.357
Wait a minute.

29:00.989 --> 29:04.909
A string of robberies begins
the moment the circus comes to town?

29:05.326 --> 29:08.036
Coincidence? I don't think so.

29:08.538 --> 29:10.498
How many times
have I ever been wrong?

29:16.713 --> 29:20.423
Achilles, that was a rhetorical question.

29:30.685 --> 29:33.685
You know,
the festival d'amour is tomorrow.

29:33.855 --> 29:35.355
Would you like to go?

29:35.940 --> 29:37.150
I don't know.

29:37.358 --> 29:39.778
But please. We shall have a good time.

29:41.488 --> 29:42.948
I'd love to.

29:54.167 --> 29:55.167
Ha, ha!

29:55.794 --> 29:57.804
Try my famous soufflé.

30:02.592 --> 30:04.302
Oh, it's ruined.

30:04.677 --> 30:06.637
No, no. Taste.

30:08.515 --> 30:09.515
Mmm.

30:11.851 --> 30:12.851
Mwah!

30:30.537 --> 30:32.787
I think those are weeds.

30:33.248 --> 30:35.418
No. Smell.

30:37.919 --> 30:38.919
Oh...

30:39.003 --> 30:41.263
They smell so flowery.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.089
They're wonderful.

30:43.132 --> 30:45.592
It's rosemary. Come on.

31:00.650 --> 31:04.240
This is one of my favorite spots
in all of Paris.

31:06.781 --> 31:08.411
Isn't it beautiful?

31:10.285 --> 31:13.115
But I can't see anything.

31:13.454 --> 31:14.964
Close your eyes.

31:15.456 --> 31:18.746
Listen to Paris.

31:44.986 --> 31:45.986
Oh.

31:46.571 --> 31:48.741
Quasi, it's wonderful.

31:54.245 --> 31:56.745
Come on, show me more.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.424
Whoo!

32:02.295 --> 32:03.495
Whoo-hoo!

32:06.257 --> 32:07.587
Whoo-hoo!

32:07.675 --> 32:09.085
Ho, ho, ho!

32:23.024 --> 32:25.694
It's all too sudden

32:26.152 --> 32:29.202
Our boy has grown

32:29.238 --> 32:31.698
There's nothing more to do

32:31.866 --> 32:35.036
- lt's true
- He's on his own

32:35.328 --> 32:38.208
We've tried to teach him

32:38.331 --> 32:41.081
We've tried to show

32:41.417 --> 32:46.797
The things a gargoyle
And a gar-guy ought to know

32:47.006 --> 32:48.256
He's gone

32:48.341 --> 32:50.051
He's left

32:50.134 --> 32:52.434
And do we feel bereft?

32:52.720 --> 32:55.220
No! He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love

32:55.306 --> 32:56.466
Fa-la-la-la-la

32:56.557 --> 32:58.847
He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love

32:59.102 --> 33:01.062
Sing a rousing, rollicking roundelay

33:01.229 --> 33:05.229
For our rip-roaring rhapsody

33:05.733 --> 33:07.693
He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love

33:08.027 --> 33:11.147
Fa-la-la-la-la-la fallen in love

33:11.906 --> 33:13.366
Why should we be blue?

33:13.408 --> 33:17.658
His love is true, so bid the kid adieu

33:18.579 --> 33:21.329
Oh, wow

33:21.708 --> 33:24.628
Just across the square

33:24.836 --> 33:27.376
Look at Quasi there

33:27.588 --> 33:30.378
Love has nailed him

33:31.050 --> 33:33.720
Oh, wow

33:33.970 --> 33:36.850
Sighing when he talks

33:37.140 --> 33:39.600
Flying when he walks

33:39.892 --> 33:43.022
Love's derailed him, ha!

33:43.104 --> 33:44.694
He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love

33:44.772 --> 33:46.022
Wow

33:46.107 --> 33:48.477
He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love

33:48.651 --> 33:50.941
Sing a merry madrigal melody

33:50.987 --> 33:53.067
For his marvelous malady

33:53.114 --> 33:55.164
Love's derailed him

33:55.324 --> 34:00.704
He's fa-la-la-la fallen in love

34:01.414 --> 34:04.044
He's fa-la-la-la la-la-la fallen

34:04.292 --> 34:10.462
Fa-la-la-la fa-la-la-la la-la-la fallen

34:10.547 --> 34:14.128
Fa-la-la-la
Oh, wow

34:14.217 --> 34:16.467
Quasimodo's fallen in love

34:33.862 --> 34:35.822
They're coming. Come on, go, go, go.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.817
Spread it out. Spread it out.

34:43.664 --> 34:45.333
You can dry off in here.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.380
Put it there, mon frère!

34:58.888 --> 35:00.008
So, what's the plan?

35:00.348 --> 35:01.888
Plan? Uh...

35:02.266 --> 35:04.016
A little soft music?

35:04.102 --> 35:05.602
A little candlelight?

35:05.770 --> 35:08.230
A cozy tête-à-tête by the fire?

35:10.191 --> 35:11.321
Gesundheit!

35:12.110 --> 35:13.150
Thank you.

35:15.196 --> 35:16.606
You're welcome.

35:16.989 --> 35:17.989
Hey!

35:18.032 --> 35:19.282
- Shh!
- Ooh.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.045
Oh.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.177
It's beautiful.

35:38.344 --> 35:39.974
Yes, you are.

35:40.221 --> 35:42.561
I mean, yes, she is.

35:42.682 --> 35:44.562
La Fidèle, that is. That's her name.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.140
La Fidèle, "The faithful one."

35:48.479 --> 35:52.479
But she's even more beautiful
on the inside.

35:55.319 --> 35:56.399
I'll show you.

36:05.538 --> 36:06.658
Whoa.

36:08.082 --> 36:10.462
This must be worth a fortune.

36:21.596 --> 36:23.256
You should get warm.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.020
Here, put this on.

36:35.943 --> 36:37.113
You're very kind.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.243
Oh.

36:39.071 --> 36:40.361
Do you

36:40.823 --> 36:43.783
really think there's more
to me than what you see?

36:44.118 --> 36:47.698
That I have something else to give?

36:48.122 --> 36:49.582
I do.

36:52.877 --> 36:55.337
I know I'm not much to look at.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.800
I've never met anyone
like you, Quasimodo.

37:04.597 --> 37:11.437
I mean, you understand the world
better than anyone I've ever known.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.110
Do you really think so?

37:15.483 --> 37:16.733
I do.

37:20.613 --> 37:21.703
I made this for you.

37:28.955 --> 37:31.615
Now you can always see yourself

37:32.333 --> 37:34.133
through my eyes.

37:40.299 --> 37:42.179
Well, I should...

37:43.010 --> 37:44.890
I mean, I'd better...

37:44.971 --> 37:48.311
It's late and, well, I'm...

37:48.683 --> 37:51.643
I'm babbling again.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.396
Stupid me.

37:55.022 --> 37:56.402
No.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.315
No, maybe I'm not.

38:00.611 --> 38:01.901
Thank you.

38:04.323 --> 38:06.373
I'll see you tomorrow?

38:11.038 --> 38:12.078
Ohh...

38:12.164 --> 38:16.044
It does my heart good
to see our boy like that.

38:16.085 --> 38:19.835
Yes. He does seem to have
a certain savoir faire.

38:21.507 --> 38:23.427
I hope it's not contagious.

38:24.844 --> 38:30.224
Come see the lovely Esmeralda
in her danse d'amour.

38:30.808 --> 38:34.138
Careful, or you may lose your heart.

38:45.239 --> 38:46.239
Esmeralda!

38:46.324 --> 38:48.704
- Me! I want to play!
- I want to play, too!

38:48.743 --> 38:49.783
Can I dance?

38:50.870 --> 38:54.460
Esmeralda, Esmeralda,
you've got to help me.

39:03.049 --> 39:04.719
Quasi, what is it? What's wrong?

39:05.092 --> 39:06.382
I think I'm sick.

39:06.510 --> 39:07.760
I feel awful.

39:07.887 --> 39:09.677
And then wonderful.

39:09.764 --> 39:13.524
And then wonderfully awful,
and awfully wonderful.

39:14.852 --> 39:16.232
Euphoria.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.484
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

39:18.856 --> 39:22.476
I see, and it hurts to breathe,
but you don't care?

39:22.610 --> 39:25.200
Yes, yes, exactly. What do I do?

39:25.446 --> 39:27.066
You have to tell her how you feel.

39:28.324 --> 39:29.874
How can I?

39:30.701 --> 39:31.791
What would she say?

39:31.869 --> 39:35.209
Sorry. I can't help you with this one.

39:36.707 --> 39:38.827
- You'll have to find out yourself.
- But I...

39:39.126 --> 39:40.166
Hey.

39:40.252 --> 39:41.292
You're ready.

39:47.259 --> 39:49.639
That circus is responsible
for a string of robberies.

39:49.845 --> 39:50.885
What?

39:51.097 --> 39:53.807
I like the circus, Papa.
I want to join, and...

39:53.849 --> 39:54.969
Absolutely not.

39:55.142 --> 39:57.142
- Those people...
- Those people?

39:57.395 --> 39:59.145
How can you lump people
together like that?

39:59.230 --> 40:02.480
But the gypsies weren't guilty of crimes
like these circus people.

40:02.817 --> 40:05.107
Madellaine's not. She's different.

40:05.194 --> 40:06.654
Well, maybe.

40:06.946 --> 40:10.026
And maybe she's just using you
to get something else.

40:10.116 --> 40:13.366
You don't think she could be
interested in me just for me?

40:13.536 --> 40:17.996
Oh, of course she could, yes,
anyone could, but look at the facts!

40:18.249 --> 40:20.129
Find some, and I will.

40:32.096 --> 40:35.176
Achilles, do you believe this?
Everybody is mad at me.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.766
How often does that happen?

40:39.812 --> 40:41.192
Rhetorical!

40:50.573 --> 40:53.323
What are you doing now,
my little cabbage?

40:55.202 --> 40:56.332
Practicing.

40:56.620 --> 40:58.120
Why strain yourself?

40:58.456 --> 41:02.626
Did you find out where the monster
keeps his bell, trinket?

41:02.877 --> 41:06.377
He is not a monster,
and I am not your trinket.

41:06.547 --> 41:08.837
I mean to have that bell.

41:09.049 --> 41:10.879
I want nothing more
to do with your thefts.

41:10.926 --> 41:13.426
Really?
And how will you survive out there?

41:13.512 --> 41:14.552
On your looks?

41:14.638 --> 41:16.388
Quasimodo sees something you don't.

41:16.474 --> 41:20.734
Does he? What if he were to have
an unfortunate accident?

41:20.769 --> 41:25.319
If I have to go up there with my men
and do it the hard way,

41:25.524 --> 41:27.574
the hunchback may get hurt.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.490
No! You can't!

41:29.904 --> 41:31.244
You wouldn't.

41:31.322 --> 41:35.702
If you want him alive,
then lure the bell-ringer away,

41:35.743 --> 41:38.453
while I steal La Fidèle.

41:38.537 --> 41:41.707
Lead him out of harm's way.

42:45.145 --> 42:46.435
Ooh, lovely.

42:50.818 --> 42:51.938
Captain!

42:52.152 --> 42:54.032
I'm here about a rash of robberies.

42:54.530 --> 42:56.570
A rash? Ooh.

42:56.907 --> 43:01.287
I find a little soothing lotion
does wonders for the complexion.

43:01.620 --> 43:03.540
I'm talking about thefts in town.

43:04.832 --> 43:06.082
Portraits!

43:09.628 --> 43:11.838
We've had nothing go missing.

43:12.631 --> 43:14.971
Except some of my hair.

43:15.050 --> 43:16.930
Are you clever enough to retrieve that?

43:25.102 --> 43:26.812
No, I suppose not.

43:27.271 --> 43:29.691
My investigation leads me here.

43:35.654 --> 43:39.494
It's true, Captain, and it's my fault.

43:39.950 --> 43:41.370
You're confessing?

43:41.452 --> 43:43.122
Absolutely.

43:43.537 --> 43:45.197
She's my responsibility.

43:45.289 --> 43:48.919
See, she's been a thief
since she was six.

43:49.209 --> 43:52.749
I thought I could break her of it
if I gave her a job,

43:52.838 --> 43:55.128
a place to call home.

43:55.215 --> 43:57.625
Oh, Madellaine.

43:58.385 --> 43:59.385
Madellaine.

43:59.470 --> 44:00.930
- Madellaine?
- Madellaine.

44:01.013 --> 44:02.473
- Where is she?
- Gone.

44:02.681 --> 44:06.811
She and the hunchback
are strolling about the town.

44:08.145 --> 44:09.185
Thank you.

44:09.313 --> 44:11.023
No, thank you, Captain.

44:11.607 --> 44:14.317
I'll let you get back to your self.

44:15.402 --> 44:16.742
Perfect.

44:17.237 --> 44:19.317
I make the heist of the century,

44:19.406 --> 44:22.616
while the girl leads
the monster and the captain away.

44:23.494 --> 44:24.874
En garde!

44:25.120 --> 44:26.200
Oh!

44:42.596 --> 44:44.096
Madellaine, I...

44:44.264 --> 44:46.024
I want to talk with you.

44:46.809 --> 44:48.429
Oh, um, let's go for a walk.

44:49.937 --> 44:50.937
I got it.

44:52.106 --> 44:53.436
Wait a second.

44:53.482 --> 44:54.772
Whoa!

45:02.074 --> 45:03.124
Oh, oh, oh!

45:03.158 --> 45:04.528
Mr. Sarousch.

45:04.827 --> 45:07.367
Can I join your circus?

45:13.210 --> 45:14.460
The price you pay.

45:14.753 --> 45:15.963
Hey! Wait!

45:18.090 --> 45:20.380
I can join the circus if I want to.

45:20.551 --> 45:21.801
Where you guys goin'?

45:22.469 --> 45:24.509
- Have you seen this woman?
- No.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.143
Do you know where I might find her?

45:32.688 --> 45:33.768
What are you doing there?

45:33.814 --> 45:35.194
Uh, nothing.

45:53.167 --> 45:55.167
Hey, who are these clowns?

45:55.669 --> 45:59.839
Madellaine says La Fidèle is

46:00.883 --> 46:02.303
this one!

46:02.926 --> 46:05.596
I smell something rotten in Denmark.

46:07.598 --> 46:09.518
Oh, Madellaine. The fool!

46:09.641 --> 46:11.351
Look at this ugly thing.

46:13.061 --> 46:14.061
Oh.

46:14.313 --> 46:15.733
What...

46:18.358 --> 46:19.898
Lovely.

46:20.277 --> 46:22.697
I'm rich, rich!

46:22.738 --> 46:24.608
I wonder if they make
diamond underwear?

46:25.157 --> 46:26.907
Oh! They're stealing La Fidèle.

46:33.874 --> 46:35.334
Here, hold this.

46:41.465 --> 46:44.505
What part of "Hold this"
was too complex?

46:52.643 --> 46:55.603
- There's something I need to tell you.
- There's something I need to know.

46:56.480 --> 46:59.730
Madellaine, you know,
the festival's tomorrow,

46:59.817 --> 47:01.147
and I thought that...

47:01.235 --> 47:04.065
I mean, we could, you know...

47:04.905 --> 47:05.905
Go?

47:06.323 --> 47:09.453
Quasi, I'm not the person you think I am.

47:12.830 --> 47:14.910
But I want to be, more than anything.

47:16.500 --> 47:18.330
Madellaine, tell me the truth.

47:24.508 --> 47:25.508
Hey!

47:26.593 --> 47:28.223
What happened to La Fidèle?

47:28.512 --> 47:33.932
Adve mysterium, obscuro tintonabulum!

47:34.059 --> 47:35.889
Mirabelay visu.

47:36.103 --> 47:38.273
Exepo facto!

47:42.734 --> 47:45.954
They stole it! Dad was right.

47:46.446 --> 47:49.116
Come on, we gotta find out
where they're taking the bell.

47:49.408 --> 47:52.738
All right, I've had enough.

47:56.790 --> 47:58.460
Something's wrong.

47:59.835 --> 48:01.085
We have to hurry.

48:01.128 --> 48:02.458
But, Quasimodo, I...

48:05.340 --> 48:07.840
La Fidèle! It's gone!

48:07.968 --> 48:09.468
The bell has been stolen!

48:09.636 --> 48:12.346
We must find her,
or the festival will be ruined.

48:12.472 --> 48:16.232
Sarousch!
How could I have been such a fool?

48:17.311 --> 48:18.391
Sarousch?

48:18.478 --> 48:21.398
Seal off the city, every street,
every river, every alley.

48:21.481 --> 48:23.611
They won't get far with a bell that size.

48:26.069 --> 48:27.649
Did you know about this?

48:28.322 --> 48:30.492
I wanted to tell you. I tried.

48:30.741 --> 48:32.661
- You used me.
- No.

48:32.743 --> 48:34.493
- "Which one is La Fidèle?"
- Please!

48:34.578 --> 48:35.618
"Let's go for a walk."

48:35.704 --> 48:37.124
You never cared about me.

48:37.247 --> 48:38.827
No, that is not true.

48:38.916 --> 48:40.036
You were right.

48:40.125 --> 48:41.205
Quasi, I'm sorry.

48:41.585 --> 48:42.995
Take her away.

48:43.629 --> 48:45.169
No, no.

48:45.213 --> 48:47.673
Quasi, please, just let me explain.

48:48.175 --> 48:49.675
Look at me!

48:49.760 --> 48:52.510
Quasimodo, just look at me!

49:32.344 --> 49:34.724
Quasi! Quasi!

49:36.890 --> 49:37.970
Quasi, is that you?

49:38.058 --> 49:39.848
I say, old chap, bit of assistance?

49:39.893 --> 49:41.233
Get us out of here!

49:42.229 --> 49:44.149
- We've got to hurry.
- Speed is essential.

49:44.231 --> 49:45.271
It wasn't my fault.

49:45.357 --> 49:46.397
One at a time.

49:46.650 --> 49:47.690
It's Zephyr.

49:47.734 --> 49:49.074
He's gone after them.

50:00.122 --> 50:02.462
What happened to the circus?

50:05.544 --> 50:06.594
Halt!

50:06.670 --> 50:08.630
Okay. Come on.

50:40.245 --> 50:43.245
Won't be long now till we're home free.

50:53.633 --> 50:54.633
Oh!

50:57.137 --> 50:58.547
Come back here.

51:01.767 --> 51:02.977
You won't get away with this.

51:03.101 --> 51:05.231
My dad's Captain of the Guard!

51:05.437 --> 51:07.227
Captain of the Guard.

51:07.814 --> 51:09.194
Really?

51:11.818 --> 51:15.278
Captain, the city is secured,
but there is no sign of Sarousch.

51:15.447 --> 51:16.817
Then we have to look further.

51:16.865 --> 51:19.115
- Phoebus!
- Zephyr has gone after Sarousch.

51:20.327 --> 51:21.537
I looked everywhere.

51:21.620 --> 51:23.870
I've got men all over the city.
We'll find him.

51:23.955 --> 51:25.475
You're looking
in all the wrong places.

51:25.957 --> 51:29.287
Sarousch has made a living
from illusion, but I can outthink him.

51:29.961 --> 51:32.001
It's the same as
the disappearing elephant.

51:32.422 --> 51:34.762
There was always
a tunnel under the stage.

51:37.677 --> 51:39.427
He's taken the bell underground.

51:40.055 --> 51:43.175
The catacombs.
He could be using the catacombs.

51:43.266 --> 51:46.056
And she could be saying
exactly what Sarousch wants her to.

51:46.186 --> 51:48.306
We go underground,
and he slips right out of town.

51:48.355 --> 51:49.555
Can't you see?

51:50.273 --> 51:51.653
Listen to me.

51:51.900 --> 51:53.860
Your son's life is at stake.

51:54.194 --> 51:55.744
Maybe you should look again.

51:56.696 --> 51:57.776
Like you did with me.

52:04.746 --> 52:07.536
All right.
But she's coming along as a prisoner.

52:49.499 --> 52:50.919
Djali!

52:52.252 --> 52:53.542
Where's Zephyr?

52:54.754 --> 52:56.764
Hurry, Djali, take us to him.

53:01.887 --> 53:03.677
Which will go better with my eyes?

53:03.847 --> 53:05.807
Diamonds or sapphires?

53:05.932 --> 53:06.972
Sarousch!

53:11.271 --> 53:13.151
Bonjour, Capitaine.

53:13.440 --> 53:14.480
Surrender now!

53:19.404 --> 53:20.454
You've got no way out!

53:20.864 --> 53:24.374
Really? I see things a bit differently.

53:24.451 --> 53:27.121
Mama! Papa!

53:27.454 --> 53:28.954
Let him go!

53:29.247 --> 53:31.577
Let him go? I think not, Captain.

53:31.875 --> 53:34.455
He's my ticket out of here.

53:35.045 --> 53:37.455
You're not going anywhere, Sarousch.

53:37.547 --> 53:39.297
Now release the boy.

53:41.801 --> 53:43.141
Let me pass safely,

53:43.220 --> 53:46.180
and you may see your
precious little boy again.

53:46.640 --> 53:48.220
Quasimodo, he means it.

53:48.308 --> 53:50.938
He'll hurt Zephyr,
but I know how we can save him.

53:50.977 --> 53:52.137
Please untie me!

53:52.229 --> 53:54.479
Why, so you can escape
with Sarousch?

53:55.815 --> 53:57.605
Don't test me, Captain.

53:57.651 --> 53:59.281
Papa!

54:17.128 --> 54:18.918
Lovely.

54:22.342 --> 54:26.512
Quasi, listen to me.
I know I hurt you. I'm sorry.

54:26.763 --> 54:28.893
But I am someone you can trust.

54:28.974 --> 54:30.564
How can I?

54:31.309 --> 54:33.229
I've already made that mistake.

54:33.520 --> 54:36.940
Quasimodo, there's more to me.

55:05.218 --> 55:07.798
Well done, mon Capitaine.

55:11.516 --> 55:14.306
Mama! Papa!

55:25.322 --> 55:27.242
You hold the rope. I'll do the rest.

55:36.166 --> 55:40.956
A hush comes over the crowd
as Madellaine begins her graceful trek.

55:47.093 --> 55:49.603
I can do this. I can do this.

55:50.597 --> 55:52.257
I know you can.

56:07.322 --> 56:08.612
What...

56:08.948 --> 56:10.238
What are you doing here?

56:12.452 --> 56:14.622
Just standing here looking pretty.

56:18.458 --> 56:20.168
Seize him!

56:20.585 --> 56:24.085
No, no, no! Not the face.
Watch the face!

56:29.219 --> 56:31.259
Mom, Dad.

56:31.596 --> 56:32.636
Mmm.

56:32.680 --> 56:33.680
Let's go.

56:33.765 --> 56:36.975
Fools! I am Sarousch.
This is not the ending I had in mind.

56:37.060 --> 56:38.350
Get in there.

56:39.979 --> 56:42.769
No prison can hold me.
Wait, we can work this out.

56:42.816 --> 56:44.976
Did I mention I do birthday parties?

57:02.335 --> 57:07.295
And now while
Quasimodo rings La Fidèle,

57:07.382 --> 57:12.392
come and proclaim your love
for all of Paris to hear.

57:13.012 --> 57:14.972
I love Josette!

57:18.101 --> 57:20.391
I love Jean Paul!

57:34.159 --> 57:35.699
I was wrong,

57:36.202 --> 57:37.492
about all of it.

57:38.955 --> 57:39.995
I know.

57:40.039 --> 57:41.829
There's only one thing I can say.

57:41.875 --> 57:46.745
I love Esmeralda!

57:46.963 --> 57:51.263
I love Phoebus!

58:04.731 --> 58:05.771
- Huh?
- Huh?

58:05.857 --> 58:07.687
- Wait a minute.
- What is that?

58:07.775 --> 58:08.895
Huh?

58:09.277 --> 58:10.277
Hmm.

58:16.743 --> 58:21.753
Quasimodo, you've shown me
that the world is full of miracles.

58:21.831 --> 58:23.961
Just ordinary miracles.

58:24.417 --> 58:25.827
They happen every day.

58:28.421 --> 58:29.761
Yuck.

58:30.173 --> 58:31.673
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

58:31.758 --> 58:33.088
- Yuck.
- Yuck.

58:34.093 --> 58:37.683
I'm so happy
I could just mildew.

58:38.598 --> 58:41.348
Lighten up. Take your heart for granite.

58:41.601 --> 58:43.021
Like me!

58:44.812 --> 58:45.812
Aw.

58:45.939 --> 58:49.649
She'd better take good care of our boy.

58:49.859 --> 58:51.859
Don't worry, I will.

58:51.986 --> 58:53.066
What...

59:08.628 --> 59:12.378
I love Madellaine!

59:12.715 --> 59:16.795
And I love Quasimodo!

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:12.515
Angel in disguise

01:00:12.734 --> 01:00:16.284
Stories in his eyes

01:00:16.529 --> 01:00:22.369
Love for every true heart that he sees

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:27.213
Was itjust a lucky day

01:00:27.707 --> 01:00:31.037
That he turned and looked my way?

01:00:31.085 --> 01:00:38.085
Or is it heaven
right before my very eyes?

01:00:39.218 --> 01:00:42.928
He's shown me all new things

01:00:43.014 --> 01:00:46.684
The shimmer of moonbeams

01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:52.558
l was blind, but now he's helped me see

01:00:54.108 --> 01:00:57.648
l was lost, but now l'm found

01:00:58.404 --> 01:01:02.204
His happiness surrounds

01:01:02.241 --> 01:01:08.251
And now l find
that my dreams can come true

01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:16.377
'Cause l'm gonna love you
for the rest of my life

01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:20.473
l'm holding you safe here

01:01:20.551 --> 01:01:24.221
ln this heart of mine

01:01:24.597 --> 01:01:28.727
l can't live without you

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:32.098
'Cause my soul would die

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:35.978
You know l'm tellin' the truth

01:01:36.067 --> 01:01:42.817
l'll spend the rest of my life loving you

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:51.504
lt didn't start this way

01:01:51.749 --> 01:01:54.959
lt happened just one day

01:01:55.628 --> 01:02:00.798
You smiled at me
and l saw you differently

01:02:02.635 --> 01:02:06.635
Now l would tremble just to be

01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:10.563
A part of you as we

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:17.357
Begin a life that's sure to never end

01:02:18.067 --> 01:02:21.817
'Cause l'm gonna love you

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:25.453
For the rest of my life

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:29.195
l'm holding you safe here

01:02:29.287 --> 01:02:33.117
ln this heart of mine

01:02:33.332 --> 01:02:37.092
l can't live without you

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:40.710
'Cause my soul would die

01:02:40.965 --> 01:02:44.675
You know l'm tellin' the truth

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:51.271
l'll spend the rest of my life loving you

01:02:55.688 --> 01:02:59.358
The rest of my life, baby

01:03:02.987 --> 01:03:06.027
Loving you
