00:57.934 --> 00:58.767
Hi, Ma.

00:58.834 --> 01:00.233
I'm steamed.

01:00.300 --> 01:02.400
Pat Sajak is off <i>Wheel of Fortune!</i>

01:02.467 --> 01:05.667
Because he has his own
late-night talk show.

01:05.734 --> 01:07.767
Oh, yeah. Right.

01:07.834 --> 01:10.867
The man spins a big wooden wheel
for eight years.

01:10.934 --> 01:14.700
Suddenly he's discussing
detente with Henry Kissinger.

01:14.767 --> 01:16.567
What else happened lately,

01:16.633 --> 01:19.567
Mike Tyson hosting
<i>Masterpiece Theater?</i>

01:20.700 --> 01:23.400
Ma, why are you so cranky today?

01:23.467 --> 01:24.800
I'm not cranky.

01:24.867 --> 01:26.000
I'm gassy.

01:27.934 --> 01:31.500
I had one of those weight watcher's
Broccoli Au Gratins for lunch.

01:31.567 --> 01:33.333
Boy, that stuff's murder.

01:34.266 --> 01:37.133
I'm surprised Lynn Redgrave
has a friend in the world.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.700
Hi. How was football practice?

01:42.767 --> 01:46.600
Terrible. It's the laziest team
I've ever seen.

01:46.667 --> 01:49.333
They didn't bust their tackles
or crack their blocks.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.000
They played like babies.

01:51.066 --> 01:52.967
Coach, you dropped your whistle.

01:53.033 --> 01:55.867
Thanks, Billy.
That was nice of you.

01:55.934 --> 01:59.166
-Now run along home.
-Ok. Bye.

01:59.233 --> 02:00.467
-Billy?
-Yes?

02:00.533 --> 02:05.200
I said run. Move it, you
little pantywaist, on the double!

02:05.266 --> 02:08.066
Rose! Rose, take it easy.

02:08.133 --> 02:10.767
You're pushing them too hard.
Honey, they're only kids.

02:10.834 --> 02:13.633
You're right. I've been under
so much pressure.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.934
I never would've volunteered
if I'd known what's involved.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.300
I need help.

02:18.367 --> 02:19.700
Mostly with your lipstick.

02:19.767 --> 02:22.600
Emmett Kelly applied makeup
with more finesse.

02:25.066 --> 02:27.133
Boy, she's really cranky.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.967
You don't want to know why.

02:30.367 --> 02:33.100
Dorothy, I just had a great idea.

02:33.166 --> 02:37.867
-Why don't you become my assistant?
-Oh, Rose, forget it.

02:37.934 --> 02:40.133
I don't want to get involved.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.967
No. You're too competitive.

02:42.033 --> 02:43.734
You take all the fun out of it.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.867
Not anymore.

02:45.934 --> 02:49.367
All I care about is these kids
having a really good time.

02:50.367 --> 02:54.066
Well, if you really mean it,
you can count me in.

02:54.133 --> 02:55.567
Oh, great.

02:55.633 --> 02:59.433
With your help, Dorothy,
we'll kick their butts.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.333
We'll chew them up
and spit them out.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.500
They'll eat dirt for breakfast.

03:05.166 --> 03:07.967
Because breakfast is the
most important meal of the day.

03:09.767 --> 03:11.967
Hi, girls. How was practice?

03:12.033 --> 03:15.266
Boys ok? No time to chat.
Later. Bye.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.767
Blanche!

03:17.834 --> 03:19.033
You're meeting him again,
aren't you?

03:19.100 --> 03:20.033
Who, Dorothy?

03:20.100 --> 03:22.333
Who else? Tom Gallagher.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.600
Blanche, you're too good for him.

03:24.667 --> 03:27.934
I will never understand
what you have against Tom.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.033
He is a shallow, insensitive snob
who stands you up constantly.

03:33.100 --> 03:37.166
There's another side to Tom
Gallagher most people don't see.

03:37.233 --> 03:38.367
-What is it?
-I don't know.

03:38.433 --> 03:40.433
I'm one of those people.

03:41.500 --> 03:46.233
He doesn't give me dirty looks for
ordering lobster, so I don't care.

03:46.300 --> 03:49.266
-Blanche!
-Maybe he's not perfect,

03:49.333 --> 03:52.633
but I'm in a little dating slump.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.967
I'm happier having
a man who isn't perfect

03:55.033 --> 03:57.133
than looking for one who is.

03:57.200 --> 04:02.000
That's what bush said when
he was choosing a vice president.

04:08.667 --> 04:13.200
(mellow music playing)

04:13.266 --> 04:15.800
Hey, Blanche, I didn't see you.

04:15.867 --> 04:17.734
Ernie, could you freshen my drink?

04:17.800 --> 04:20.800
-Sure. Look--
-With extra ice cubes.

04:20.867 --> 04:21.533
Ok, but--

04:21.600 --> 04:24.900
You're so stingy
with your ice cubes.

04:24.967 --> 04:26.667
Blanche--

04:26.734 --> 04:28.266
I keep interrupting you

04:28.333 --> 04:31.166
because I don't want
to hear what you'll say.

04:31.233 --> 04:33.166
He called and canceled again,
didn't he?

04:33.233 --> 04:36.367
I'm sorry. He said to buy
anything you'd like.

04:36.867 --> 04:40.500
Really? Then open your phone book
to the jewelry section.

04:43.266 --> 04:46.133
It's no fun being stood up, is it?

04:46.200 --> 04:49.133
Listen, if you're looking
for a quick score

04:49.200 --> 04:52.367
because you think I'm down,
you can think again.

04:52.433 --> 04:54.667
I was looking for sympathy.

04:54.734 --> 04:56.900
-I got stood up myself.
-Really?

04:56.967 --> 04:59.667
Cross my heart,
what's left of it.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.700
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just so darned angry.

05:03.767 --> 05:04.900
My name's Blanche.

05:04.967 --> 05:07.734
-John Quinn.
-How do you do?

05:07.800 --> 05:10.333
I feel too old to be stood up.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.934
You're not alone.
This is his fourth cancellation.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.967
He just found somebody better.

05:16.033 --> 05:16.867
Oh, Blanche.

05:16.934 --> 05:19.000
Yes. Somebody younger and prettier.

05:19.066 --> 05:20.367
Blanche, it can't be.

05:20.433 --> 05:22.233
Well, maybe you're right.

05:24.967 --> 05:27.600
Somebody younger and as pretty.

05:27.667 --> 05:30.767
Maybe I learned my lesson.

05:30.834 --> 05:32.834
No more dates for a long time.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.200
-Do you mean that?
-I do.

05:35.266 --> 05:37.800
I'm with you.
No more dates.

05:37.867 --> 05:39.734
-Here's looking at you.
-Cheers.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.266
Oh, I'm so... oh.

05:41.333 --> 05:42.767
I'm so sorry.
Did I get you?

05:42.834 --> 05:45.767
No. Let me help you.

05:45.834 --> 05:51.133
Thanks. This is embarrassing.
I'm the clumsiest guy on earth.

05:51.200 --> 05:54.133
-Do you know a good dry cleaner?
-The best.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.567
Know Andre's on Elm?

05:56.633 --> 06:00.567
Andre takes his clothes
to this place. I'll write it down.

06:02.033 --> 06:04.066
I'm glad it was red wine
and not white.

06:04.133 --> 06:05.700
White's easier to get out.

06:05.767 --> 06:08.567
I spilled red meat on this jacket.

06:08.633 --> 06:11.000
I don't want your dry cleaner
thinking I'm gauche.

06:12.166 --> 06:13.300
Here you go.

06:13.367 --> 06:17.166
I'll run along. Nice meeting you,
Mr. John Quinn.

06:17.233 --> 06:19.567
Thank you.
Same here, Blanche...

06:19.633 --> 06:21.400
Devereaux. Good night.

06:21.467 --> 06:22.533
Good night.

06:24.033 --> 06:25.667
-Blanche?
-Yes?

06:25.734 --> 06:29.700
Maybe I'm a hypocrite,
but can I call you for dinner?

06:29.767 --> 06:32.033
There's only one way
I can think of.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.867
Look at that napkin. My number's
on it. Good night.

06:38.934 --> 06:40.667
Can I get something
else for you, John?

06:40.734 --> 06:42.400
No. I'll call it a night, Ernie.

06:42.467 --> 06:45.734
Ok. Take care.

06:45.800 --> 06:46.967
Thanks, Ernie.

06:52.967 --> 06:56.133
(serene music playing)

06:57.233 --> 06:59.266
Tommy Turner.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.533
71. Don't miss any meals.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.133
If you're less than 70,
you can't play.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.200
Freddy Leone.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.567
92.

07:10.633 --> 07:13.867
Remember, lasagna was not meant
to go in a sandwich.

07:16.567 --> 07:19.300
Last but not least, Billy Haskell.

07:21.300 --> 07:23.800
-72.
-Yeah!

07:23.867 --> 07:27.066
Wait. Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.066
How much does
he weigh now, Ma?

07:33.467 --> 07:34.867
68.

07:34.934 --> 07:36.300
Aw.

07:36.367 --> 07:38.367
Sorry, coach. I tried.

07:38.433 --> 07:40.033
I don't understand.

07:40.100 --> 07:44.767
-You said take the book and...
-Study. Study. Study. Study.

07:44.834 --> 07:47.867
No game Saturday, Billy.
I'm sorry.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.333
Everybody, I'll see you
at practice tomorrow.

07:53.133 --> 07:58.700
Thanks. You taught those boys
that it's more important to win

07:58.767 --> 08:00.100
than to play by the rules.

08:00.166 --> 08:01.767
Big deal! 2 pounds!

08:01.834 --> 08:03.100
He's our best player.

08:03.166 --> 08:05.800
Without Billy, the team can't win.

08:05.867 --> 08:09.100
Rules exist for people like Billy.

08:09.166 --> 08:11.934
Little bodies hate it
when big bodies fall on them.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.467
Which is why Raymond Burr
never married.

08:21.166 --> 08:23.166
Girls, quick, I need some advice.

08:23.233 --> 08:26.066
Wear half as much makeup
and twice as much underwear.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.166
Take it as a standing
recommendation.

08:30.233 --> 08:32.300
It's about these earrings.

08:32.367 --> 08:34.600
Are they dressy enough
for a nice dinner?

08:34.667 --> 08:38.133
Oh, don't tell me you're seeing
Tom Gallagher again.

08:38.200 --> 08:42.600
No. It's that man I met in the bar,
John Quinn.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.033
He just called me.

08:44.100 --> 08:45.734
He asked you out?

08:45.800 --> 08:50.433
Yes. I know it's quick, but when
Blanche Devereaux wants a man,

08:50.500 --> 08:52.734
she doesn't stand on ceremony.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.100
Or the floor.

08:56.367 --> 08:59.100
You seem pretty excited
about this date.

08:59.166 --> 09:01.900
Something tells me
this man's just about perfect.

09:01.967 --> 09:03.900
John is everything Tom wasn't.

09:03.967 --> 09:06.700
-He's smart, mature, responsible--
-(doorbell rings)

09:06.767 --> 09:07.900
And on time.

09:07.967 --> 09:11.900
Girls, keep him entertained.
I want to look perfect for him.

09:15.867 --> 09:17.767
-Hello.
-Hi. I'm John Quinn.

09:17.834 --> 09:19.700
Hi. I'm Rose,
Blanche's roommate.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.333
-Hi, Rose.
-Won't you come in?

09:22.400 --> 09:24.800
Could you give me a hand?

09:24.867 --> 09:25.834
Well, sure.

09:30.033 --> 09:31.066
That's...

09:32.233 --> 09:33.767
that's ok. I'll use this.

09:35.266 --> 09:36.834
-Come in.
-Thank you.

09:36.900 --> 09:40.433
Oh, how do you do, John?
I'm Dorothy.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.867
-I'm Blanche's other roommate.
-Hello, Dorothy.

09:42.934 --> 09:46.100
And I'm her gorgeous
22-year-old cousin.

09:49.266 --> 09:51.567
Hey, how many chances do I get?

09:53.333 --> 09:56.100
Hello, John. How do I look?

09:56.166 --> 09:59.300
-Blanche.
-Don't I look just adorable?

09:59.367 --> 10:02.066
-Blanche.
-Are you blinded by my beauty?

10:02.133 --> 10:03.600
Blanche!

10:04.867 --> 10:06.533
Oh, my God.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.867
Want a glass of water
to wash down your foot?

10:13.867 --> 10:17.934
Blanche, was there something
you didn't realize the other night?

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
You mean about you being blind?

10:21.066 --> 10:24.333
Oh, goodness, no. I knew that.
I'm not blind.

10:26.900 --> 10:29.200
Not that there's anything
wrong in that.

10:29.266 --> 10:32.400
Course there's nothing good
about it either.

10:32.467 --> 10:33.633
Could we just go?

10:35.066 --> 10:36.533
What restaurant
are we headed to?

10:36.600 --> 10:38.433
Harvey's at the shore.
Do you know it?

10:38.500 --> 10:41.867
-No, I don't.
-You'll love the view.

10:48.867 --> 10:50.934
(mellow music playing)

10:51.000 --> 10:53.633
In this formation,
you're lined up in a wishbone

10:53.700 --> 10:56.367
with the u-back in motion.
Questions?

10:56.433 --> 10:58.133
I've got a question.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.900
Am I an "X" or an "O"?

10:59.967 --> 11:01.033
An "O."

11:01.100 --> 11:04.500
The other team are the X's,
and you're O's.

11:04.567 --> 11:06.166
It's easy to remember.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.967
It's the number of points
you scored this season.

11:11.734 --> 11:16.066
The tight end decoys
like we're running a draw play,

11:16.133 --> 11:19.100
then he slips into the zone
over the middle.

11:19.166 --> 11:22.900
The flanker fakes a screen,
then runs behind the halfback,

11:22.967 --> 11:24.834
giving the quarterback two options.

11:24.900 --> 11:30.934
For God's sake, Rose, Eisenhower
used less chalk planning D-day!

11:31.000 --> 11:36.200
Ok, let's talk about a few things
that happened in the last game.

11:36.266 --> 11:38.800
Nobody blocked this "X."

11:38.867 --> 11:40.900
Billy could have blocked him.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.900
Maybe Billy could have,
but Billy couldn't play.

11:43.967 --> 11:45.934
We all know why.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I don't want to mention any names.
Follow my eyes.

11:53.533 --> 11:57.433
Ok, that's it for practice today.
Everybody get a good night's sleep.

11:59.867 --> 12:03.400
Coach Dorothy, could Billy and I
get weighed together and divide it?

12:03.467 --> 12:06.033
Oh, I'm sorry. Nice try.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.834
You're thinking like
a fourth grader already.

12:08.900 --> 12:11.100
I told you it wouldn't work.

12:16.633 --> 12:18.233
Happy, Dorothy?

12:18.300 --> 12:21.200
Thanks to you,
we can't win tomorrow's game

12:21.266 --> 12:22.467
without our star player.

12:22.533 --> 12:26.633
I'm tired of being treated
like a villain

12:26.700 --> 12:28.400
simply because I play
by the rules.

12:28.467 --> 12:30.900
Relax. It'll be over tomorrow.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.667
If I make it that far.

12:32.734 --> 12:35.867
I caught something
practicing out in the rain.

12:35.934 --> 12:39.867
So did I. I hope none
of the boys caught it.

12:39.934 --> 12:41.967
Don't worry.
They can't catch anything.

12:42.033 --> 12:44.066
I've seen them practice.

12:45.900 --> 12:46.934
Hi, girls.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.700
How was your date with John?

12:49.767 --> 12:52.600
Oh, perfect,
dinner and the symphony.

12:52.667 --> 12:54.367
You must be serious.

12:54.433 --> 12:57.000
You've seen him
every night this week.

12:57.066 --> 12:58.900
You're a lucky woman.

12:58.967 --> 13:03.266
John's just the type I always
figured was perfect for my Dorothy.

13:03.333 --> 13:04.700
Oh, he sure is.

13:04.767 --> 13:07.300
He's smart. He's sophisticated.

13:07.367 --> 13:09.667
I was talking blind.

13:13.100 --> 13:14.500
(telephone rings)

13:14.567 --> 13:16.467
I'll get it.

13:16.533 --> 13:18.333
Hello.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.333
Well, hello there.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.133
How have you been?

13:23.200 --> 13:26.000
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I am free tonight.

13:27.533 --> 13:30.567
Well, I would just love
to meet for drinks.

13:30.633 --> 13:32.166
7 is perfect.

13:32.233 --> 13:34.166
Bye.

13:34.233 --> 13:37.433
Blanche, don't tell me
that was Tom Gallagher.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.767
What if it was?

13:38.834 --> 13:40.900
You have plans with John.

13:40.967 --> 13:43.100
Obviously, I'll just have to cancel.

13:43.166 --> 13:45.300
Blanche, I can't believe this.

13:45.367 --> 13:48.934
You expect me to limit myself
to one man?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.700
When it's one terrific man, yes.

13:51.767 --> 13:53.867
Then you don't know me.

13:53.934 --> 13:58.367
It's the best relationship
you've had in years.

13:58.433 --> 13:59.734
Why do you want to ruin it?

13:59.800 --> 14:01.533
It's never going to work.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.000
-Why?
-Because the man's blind.

14:04.066 --> 14:07.133
Now, please keep your noses out
of my business.

14:08.200 --> 14:12.700
When it comes to other people,
you're the one who's blind!

14:17.633 --> 14:20.333
(calm music playing)

14:22.800 --> 14:23.867
Here we go, Dorothy.

14:23.934 --> 14:26.233
Two bowls of Sophia's
homemade remedy.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.200
Oh, Rose,
this isn't going to work.

14:28.266 --> 14:31.834
-We have the flu.
-We have to at least try.

14:31.900 --> 14:35.633
Today's the big game.
We can't let those kids down.

14:38.233 --> 14:40.367
Ooh, what is in this?

14:40.433 --> 14:46.967
Red peppers, oregano, garlic,
chicken fat, and lard.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.700
Sophia swears it works every time.
Now, eat up.

14:55.100 --> 14:59.200
-Oh, this is disgusting.
-What's disgusting?

14:59.266 --> 15:00.934
Your cure for the flu.

15:01.033 --> 15:03.900
That remedy's been in
our family for generations.

15:03.967 --> 15:06.333
-And it always works?
-Always.

15:06.400 --> 15:09.166
Of course,
I never saw anyone eat it.

15:10.867 --> 15:14.300
Usually, you just throw
a glob on the vaporizer.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.233
Oh, Rose, this is hopeless.

15:22.300 --> 15:25.867
We're never going to feel well
enough to coach that game today.

15:25.934 --> 15:28.367
I guess we'll have to forfeit,

15:28.433 --> 15:30.734
but it's going to break
those kids' hearts.

15:30.800 --> 15:34.000
Forfeit? You mean quit?

15:34.066 --> 15:35.066
You can't do that, Rose.

15:35.133 --> 15:36.700
Nobody in my family ever quits.

15:36.767 --> 15:39.066
I'm not in your family.

15:39.133 --> 15:42.166
Pretend, Rose.
I'm going for a moment here.

15:43.667 --> 15:45.233
You never saw a Frank Capra film?

15:46.934 --> 15:48.233
I'm taking over.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.300
-(doorbell rings)
-Wish me luck.

15:50.367 --> 15:53.233
Ma, you don't know
anything about football.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.967
Please. What's to know?

15:55.000 --> 15:59.033
You hit a guy, you grab the pigskin,
you run like crazy.

15:59.100 --> 16:00.700
It's like shopping in Sicily.

16:04.233 --> 16:05.400
Hi, Sophia.

16:05.467 --> 16:06.967
Let's roll, Freddy.

16:07.033 --> 16:08.867
We got a game to win.

16:08.934 --> 16:12.967
That was really a sweet thing
for Sophia to do.

16:13.033 --> 16:14.133
I know.

16:14.200 --> 16:17.367
If she loses, I'll punch her
stinking heart out.

16:22.133 --> 16:24.934
Oh, good.
I'm glad you girls are here.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.767
I acted stupid last night.
I apologize.

16:27.834 --> 16:29.133
I need to talk.

16:29.200 --> 16:33.767
No matter what we say,
you'll do exactly what you want.

16:33.834 --> 16:37.133
We said you were pushing away
a terrific guy,

16:37.200 --> 16:38.266
and you did, didn't you?

16:38.333 --> 16:41.066
Yes, but you don't
understand why.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.133
You told us.
Because he's blind.

16:43.200 --> 16:47.800
You don't know what it meant to me
dating a blind man.

16:47.867 --> 16:51.967
John took away what
I felt secure about, my looks.

16:52.033 --> 16:53.967
How do I always attract men?

16:54.033 --> 16:57.300
Being pretty, acting sexy,
showing a little leg.

16:57.367 --> 16:59.400
With John, that doesn't work.

16:59.467 --> 17:04.400
I spent half the time thinking,
"what does he like about me?"

17:04.467 --> 17:07.800
You went back to Tom,
knowing what he likes.

17:07.867 --> 17:10.200
Yes, but I was miserable.

17:10.266 --> 17:12.000
I wanted to be with John.

17:12.066 --> 17:14.500
Then tell all this to john.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.667
Guess that's my only choice.

17:16.734 --> 17:20.800
Yes, I'm going to patch things
up tonight.

17:20.867 --> 17:23.300
Oh, thank you.

17:23.367 --> 17:25.233
I'm so glad we're friends again.

17:25.300 --> 17:26.967
Honey, of course, we are.

17:27.033 --> 17:30.000
I've never asked you
what you all have.

17:30.066 --> 17:31.567
Oh, we're not sure.

17:31.633 --> 17:34.266
It makes your skin blotchy

17:34.333 --> 17:36.900
and your eyes puffy
and your cheeks swollen,

17:36.967 --> 17:38.500
and you get heart palpitations.

17:38.567 --> 17:40.400
Good thing for those palpitations.

17:40.467 --> 17:43.133
Otherwise you might
not know you had it.

17:53.967 --> 17:56.967
(serene music playing)

17:57.467 --> 18:00.367
Okay, here's the game plan.

18:00.433 --> 18:01.967
We keep it on the ground,

18:02.033 --> 18:04.100
then when they're used to it
on the ground,

18:04.166 --> 18:05.533
we attack them
through the air.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.734
I've used the same formula
for 60 years of lovemaking.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.200
Trust me, it works.

18:10.266 --> 18:12.934
Okay, everybody, hit the field.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.934
Yeah!

18:17.667 --> 18:19.700
You're upset
'cause you can't play, aren't you?

18:19.767 --> 18:22.133
Still could, if you let me.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.166
Aren't you still two pounds
below the limit?

18:24.233 --> 18:26.967
Yeah.
Boy, I hate being small.

18:27.033 --> 18:29.433
Hey, being small isn't all bad.

18:29.500 --> 18:32.600
-Take it from someone who knows.
-You mean, you?

18:32.667 --> 18:34.533
You see Billy Barty sitting here?

18:36.266 --> 18:39.066
There are big advantages
to being small.

18:39.133 --> 18:42.934
One, you never outgrow your clothes,
two, you seldom bump your head,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.300
three, the world thinks you're cute.

18:45.367 --> 18:48.433
You think Danny DeVito got to be
famous with his good looks?

18:50.033 --> 18:52.734
There's nothing wrong
with being small, kid.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.367
But it is wrong to cheat.

18:54.433 --> 18:58.700
You learn in life to follow
the rules and play fair,

18:58.767 --> 19:01.266
you'll be heads above the crowd.

19:01.333 --> 19:05.033
You know, Sophia? All of a sudden,
I feel so much better.

19:05.100 --> 19:08.066
I had a feeling, at your age,
a good cliche would work.

19:10.700 --> 19:13.200
-Now, eat this.
-What is it?

19:13.266 --> 19:14.600
That's a meatball
and pepper sandwich.

19:14.667 --> 19:17.633
If that doesn't put
the weight on you, nothing will.

19:17.700 --> 19:19.834
-Okay, get suited up.
-All right.

19:32.233 --> 19:34.867
Well, don't just stand there.

19:34.934 --> 19:36.000
What?

19:36.066 --> 19:39.100
Your perfume gives you
away every time.

19:39.166 --> 19:42.734
For a blind man,
you're certainly observant.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.700
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.367
Your secretary said you were meeting
somebody here,

19:48.433 --> 19:51.300
so I won't keep you.
I wanted to talk.

19:51.367 --> 19:55.000
If you're apologizing for
last night, I understand.

19:55.066 --> 19:59.400
Well, I'm not sure you do, John.

19:59.467 --> 20:01.934
I like you very much.

20:02.033 --> 20:05.233
The problem is,
I don't know what you like about me.

20:05.300 --> 20:08.700
I'm used to men
liking me for my looks,

20:08.767 --> 20:11.467
at least partly,
and you don't.

20:11.533 --> 20:13.600
I sure don't.

20:13.667 --> 20:15.834
Actually, I'm glad
I never have to look at you.

20:21.266 --> 20:23.300
-What?
-That's right.

20:23.367 --> 20:27.767
When I like somebody, I get to
make up what they look like.

20:27.834 --> 20:30.767
And when I like
somebody a lot,

20:30.834 --> 20:34.100
I make up a pretty nice picture.

20:34.166 --> 20:37.800
May I ask what picture
you have of me?

20:37.867 --> 20:42.100
You make me laugh,
so you've got a terrific smile.

20:42.166 --> 20:43.467
Yes.

20:43.533 --> 20:46.967
You're smart and thoughtful,
so you've got beautiful eyes.

20:47.033 --> 20:49.467
Yes.

20:49.533 --> 20:52.200
You love music, so you've
probably got a big behind.

20:52.266 --> 20:53.633
Yes...

20:56.467 --> 20:57.600
no.

21:00.433 --> 21:03.900
Just wanted to see
if you were paying attention.

21:03.967 --> 21:05.633
I think you're just terrific.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.767
I feel stupid about last night.

21:07.834 --> 21:10.000
Don't, Blanche. It's not easy.

21:10.066 --> 21:13.500
Let's make plans for next week.
My treat.

21:13.567 --> 21:14.967
I'll call you Monday.

21:15.467 --> 21:17.066
Great.

21:17.567 --> 21:18.834
John.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.800
Elaine, hello.

21:20.867 --> 21:22.000
Blanche, this is Elaine.

21:22.066 --> 21:24.467
Hello, Elaine.
I was just leaving.

21:24.533 --> 21:27.266
You and Elaine have
a good time tonight,

21:27.333 --> 21:29.033
and just so you'll know,

21:29.100 --> 21:33.633
it looks like Elaine is a
bigger music lover than I am.

21:45.800 --> 21:46.800
Oh.

21:46.867 --> 21:49.200
Did everything
work out with John?

21:49.266 --> 21:53.233
We're getting together next week.
You're not in bed.

21:53.300 --> 21:54.767
We just got out.

21:54.834 --> 21:58.266
Feels like we spent
the whole day in bed.

21:58.333 --> 22:00.333
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

22:03.333 --> 22:05.333
Make way for the victors.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.867
You won the game?

22:06.934 --> 22:08.500
No, Rose, we lost,

22:08.567 --> 22:10.433
and we all changed
our names to victor.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.000
Of course, we won.

22:16.066 --> 22:17.333
Now it's time for ice cream.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.200
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

22:19.266 --> 22:21.333
Good going, guys.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.967
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

22:24.033 --> 22:25.233
Did you let Billy play?

22:25.300 --> 22:26.567
Billy, Billy...

22:26.633 --> 22:27.967
Little boy, brown hair.

22:28.033 --> 22:30.767
-She knows.
-He played a little.

22:30.834 --> 22:32.900
Ma, that was illegal.

22:32.967 --> 22:36.033
I gave him a sandwich
so he'd make weight.

22:36.100 --> 22:39.700
He got a cramp
and had to sit out.

22:39.767 --> 22:41.900
They won it without him.

22:42.400 --> 22:45.500
They won because of the discipline
I taught them.

22:45.567 --> 22:49.333
It's because
of the team spirit I taught them.

22:49.400 --> 22:54.133
It was the statue of Mussolini play
I taught them.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.433
What's that?

22:55.500 --> 22:59.166
Everybody piles on the
star quarterback on the first play,

22:59.233 --> 23:01.033
then he's out
for the rest of the game.

23:03.066 --> 23:08.166
Ma, that is a mean, underhanded,
despicable thing to do.

23:08.233 --> 23:09.867
So was World War II.

23:09.934 --> 23:12.300
We're talking about Mussolini.

23:19.333 --> 23:22.533
(theme music playing)
