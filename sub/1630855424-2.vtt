WEBVTT

00:20.571 --> 00:23.033
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:26.036 --> 00:27.495
Morning, gentlemen.

00:28.288 --> 00:29.914
What's going on here?

00:30.831 --> 00:32.333
I'm Special Agent Moseley.

00:32.417 --> 00:33.876
This is Special Agent
Donaldson.

00:33.960 --> 00:36.254
We're with the United States
Secret Service.

00:36.337 --> 00:37.922
Secret Service?

00:38.006 --> 00:39.215
Mm-mm.

00:39.299 --> 00:40.550
Never heard of it.

00:40.633 --> 00:42.135
Yeah, we get that a lot.

00:43.178 --> 00:45.055
The reason you haven't heard
of the Secret Service

00:45.138 --> 00:47.890
is, well, because it's secret.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.352
We're part
of the Treasury Department...

00:54.022 --> 00:56.774
Which I can see
doesn't ring a bell, either.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.944
What kind of cargo
you boys hauling today?

00:59.945 --> 01:01.321
We don't load it.

01:01.404 --> 01:03.108
If there's a paycheck in it,
we don't ask.

01:03.198 --> 01:05.283
You mind if I check the back?

01:05.366 --> 01:08.369
Just a quick look,
you'll be on your way.

01:12.117 --> 01:13.749
Go on, then. Get it done.

01:32.268 --> 01:33.603
Ahh!

01:48.534 --> 01:50.120
Oh, God!

01:59.045 --> 02:00.255
Oh...

02:00.338 --> 02:01.714
You shot me in the hand!

02:01.797 --> 02:03.299
Well, you shot my partner.

02:03.383 --> 02:05.593
And the only reason
I'm not wiping your brains

02:05.676 --> 02:07.512
off my boots right now
is that we haven't

02:07.595 --> 02:09.055
finished our conversation.

02:31.161 --> 02:32.662
Jesus Christ.

02:38.043 --> 02:39.252
Your dead friends
were printing

02:39.335 --> 02:41.087
counterfeit bills in here.

02:46.426 --> 02:48.970
I'm guessing the press
was right there.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.100
Now someone's absconded
with it,

02:54.184 --> 02:56.186
along with the plates
for those bills.

02:58.021 --> 02:59.689
And I need to find them.

02:59.772 --> 03:00.773
I don't know.

03:00.856 --> 03:02.733
Everything was here
when I picked up the money.

03:04.444 --> 03:06.071
That's disappointing.

03:07.447 --> 03:09.157
Was that all the men,
or were there more?

03:09.234 --> 03:10.408
I don't know.

03:13.369 --> 03:14.955
You don't know much, do you?

03:24.880 --> 03:25.923
There was a guy.

03:26.007 --> 03:27.383
What guy?

03:27.467 --> 03:29.510
Ah, fuck!

03:29.594 --> 03:30.928
Ah!

03:31.012 --> 03:33.974
I don't know,
some Chinese fella.

03:34.057 --> 03:37.060
Ah, fuck...

03:37.143 --> 03:39.770
Tell me about
this Chinese fella.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.355
You've been at it
fucking night and day,

05:10.445 --> 05:11.862
and this is the best
you've got?

05:11.947 --> 05:14.699
These onions don't know
what they're fucking doing.

05:14.782 --> 05:17.243
We need people who specialize
in this kind of work.

05:17.327 --> 05:20.080
No, no outsiders.

05:20.163 --> 05:21.539
You want to do this?

05:21.622 --> 05:23.041
Or you want to do this right?

05:23.124 --> 05:24.292
If you got the chop
you promised us,

05:24.369 --> 05:25.585
we wouldn't have to do it
at all.

05:26.836 --> 05:29.547
We can bring in
someone local,

05:29.630 --> 05:31.174
someone we can control.

05:31.257 --> 05:33.051
But Chao's right.

05:33.134 --> 05:34.760
We can't do this on our own.

05:37.722 --> 05:38.681
It's your call.

05:43.853 --> 05:45.230
I want you on this.

05:45.313 --> 05:46.856
Get me?

05:46.940 --> 05:48.108
I get you.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.699
It sounds like you have
someone in mind.

05:59.244 --> 06:00.328
Maybe.

06:22.100 --> 06:23.643
Nobody fucking move!

06:24.727 --> 06:26.062
Get up!

06:26.146 --> 06:27.647
Here, you--relax!

06:27.730 --> 06:30.025
We're the San Francisco
Police Department.

06:30.108 --> 06:32.318
Get the hell out of here!

06:32.402 --> 06:33.778
This building
and all its tenants

06:33.861 --> 06:37.442
are in violation
of the Cubic Air Ordinance,

06:37.532 --> 06:40.994
and this property must be
vacated by order of the mayor.

06:42.703 --> 06:45.290
Now round 'em up
and get 'em out!

06:58.386 --> 06:59.554
What's this?

06:59.637 --> 07:01.514
How can anyone live like this?

07:01.597 --> 07:02.974
Get over here!

07:11.816 --> 07:13.276
Is this really necessary,
sir?

07:13.359 --> 07:14.860
He threatened
an officer of the law.

07:14.945 --> 07:16.481
He waved a fucking spatula!

07:16.571 --> 07:18.323
Are you questioning
my method, Sergeant O'Hara?

07:18.406 --> 07:19.615
I am just trying
to figure out

07:19.699 --> 07:20.992
what we're doing here is all.

07:21.076 --> 07:22.368
Well, it's not your job
to figure.

07:22.452 --> 07:24.996
It's your job
to follow my orders!

07:25.080 --> 07:27.082
Hit him again!

07:28.874 --> 07:30.001
Now!

07:39.219 --> 07:41.721
"Despite only recently
entering the public sphere,

07:41.804 --> 07:44.307
"Mr. Thayer has displayed
both a refreshing

07:44.390 --> 07:49.020
"plainspokenness and an almost
pathological lack of guile.

07:49.104 --> 07:51.814
"One might worry about
such a man among the pit vipers

07:51.897 --> 07:54.359
"of San Francisco politics
if not for the sense

07:54.442 --> 07:57.070
"that his unabashed
Americanness will provide

07:57.153 --> 07:59.780
sturdy enough armor
to withstand them."

07:59.864 --> 08:01.574
Jesus, with press like this,

08:01.657 --> 08:04.119
why even bother
with the campaign?

08:04.202 --> 08:08.206
Well, he's young,
handsome, good lineage.

08:08.289 --> 08:09.582
You can see why he's popular.

08:09.665 --> 08:11.709
Maybe you'd prefer
to work for him.

08:12.668 --> 08:13.711
Of course not.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.630
Just because a man knows
how to present himself

08:15.713 --> 08:16.881
does not mean he knows
the first thing

08:16.965 --> 08:17.923
about running a city,

08:18.008 --> 08:19.509
though I'm not quite sure
the voters

08:19.592 --> 08:20.718
will appreciate
the distinction.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.720
He's got a good deal of support
among the industrialists.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.097
Well, of course he does.

08:24.180 --> 08:26.224
I'm saddled with cleaning up
an entire city.

08:26.307 --> 08:28.726
They're only concerned
with their finances.

08:28.809 --> 08:32.355
Speaking of finances,
the state attorney

08:32.438 --> 08:33.648
for the late Mayor Blake

08:33.731 --> 08:36.526
has been questioning
recent expenses.

08:36.609 --> 08:38.528
Will it be a problem?

08:38.611 --> 08:40.030
I don't think so.

08:40.113 --> 08:41.566
But you custodianship
of the Blake estate

08:41.656 --> 08:44.409
is still predicated on his
oversight and justification

08:44.492 --> 08:46.744
of all expenditures.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.573
Mayor Blake would have
wanted me to keep

08:48.663 --> 08:50.999
his political legacy alive,
as would his wife,

08:51.082 --> 08:53.418
had she not fallen ill.

08:53.501 --> 08:55.962
That should be
justification enough.

08:56.046 --> 08:57.713
I can sell that.

08:57.797 --> 08:59.840
Let's just hope she doesn't
recover anytime soon,

08:59.924 --> 09:01.301
'cause you'll need
every last dime

09:01.384 --> 09:03.136
of Blake's fortune
to mount a winning campaign

09:03.219 --> 09:04.387
against Thayer.

09:04.470 --> 09:06.764
She's not going anywhere.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.433
I'll make sure of that.

09:10.143 --> 09:11.644
There he is. Mr. Mayor!

09:13.813 --> 09:15.773
This way, please.
One by yourself.

09:17.192 --> 09:18.151
Mr. Mayor?

09:18.234 --> 09:21.362
Chief Atwood,
excellent work today.

09:21.446 --> 09:22.863
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

09:24.574 --> 09:25.450
And hold.

09:29.955 --> 09:33.666
Thank you all for coming.

09:33.749 --> 09:38.213
Today, our new chief of police,
Colonel Benjamin Atwood,

09:38.296 --> 09:41.674
carried out a successful raid
in Chinatown,

09:41.757 --> 09:45.303
shuttering yet another breeding
ground of vice and disease.

09:52.310 --> 09:54.187
Can I help you gentlemen?

09:54.270 --> 09:55.313
We're looking for someone

09:55.396 --> 09:57.941
I'm told might be employed
hereabouts,

09:58.024 --> 10:00.235
name of Lee.

10:00.318 --> 10:01.694
Doesn't ring a bell.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.530
I see.

10:04.614 --> 10:06.491
Maybe a picture will help.

10:10.036 --> 10:13.623
Good-looking fella, ain't he?

10:13.706 --> 10:17.585
All you gotta do is point us
in the right direction.

10:18.753 --> 10:20.755
Well, all right, then.

11:03.881 --> 11:05.925
You all right?

11:06.676 --> 11:08.094
Richard?

11:08.178 --> 11:09.429
Yeah.

11:09.512 --> 11:11.139
Yeah, I'm good.

11:11.222 --> 11:13.558
Are you?

11:13.641 --> 11:15.143
- Fine.
- Yeah.

11:17.395 --> 11:18.646
Did anyone hear?

11:20.273 --> 11:21.726
I don't think so.

11:29.199 --> 11:30.450
Lock up behind me.

11:30.533 --> 11:32.077
Whoa. Where you going?

11:32.160 --> 11:34.287
To get Jack.

11:34.370 --> 11:37.873
We knew what might happen
if men came looking for you.

11:37.958 --> 11:39.584
Now we gotta deal with it.

11:39.667 --> 11:41.461
Are you sure
we can trust him?

11:42.670 --> 11:46.132
A couple of dead
white men in his bar?

11:46.216 --> 11:47.925
He'll take care of it.

11:48.009 --> 11:49.594
Don't worry.

11:49.677 --> 11:51.596
I'm not gonna tell him
why they were here.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.651
Are you settling in?

12:07.028 --> 12:08.863
You've been most welcoming.

12:08.947 --> 12:11.616
Well, I'm grateful
to have you with us,

12:11.699 --> 12:14.244
especially during
such complicated times.

12:15.245 --> 12:16.454
Thank you.

12:17.372 --> 12:19.415
What are your thoughts
on the Hop Wei?

12:22.835 --> 12:25.671
You lost quite a few men
the other day,

12:25.755 --> 12:27.590
from what I understand.

12:27.673 --> 12:31.469
Yes, Li Yong thinks
we're being too aggressive.

12:31.552 --> 12:33.096
What do you think?

12:37.725 --> 12:40.270
Li Yong is a great fighter

12:40.353 --> 12:43.898
because he knows when to strike

12:43.982 --> 12:46.026
and when to hold his ground.

12:46.109 --> 12:47.860
So you agree with him?

12:52.365 --> 12:55.743
Young Jun isn't half
the leader his father was,

12:55.820 --> 12:57.370
or that you are,
for that matter.

12:57.453 --> 12:59.039
Flattery?

12:59.122 --> 13:01.499
It's more about him than you.

13:03.584 --> 13:05.086
Under his leadership,

13:05.170 --> 13:07.172
the Hop Wei's fortunes
have suffered.

13:07.255 --> 13:10.633
They're growing more desperate
every day.

13:10.716 --> 13:14.470
My advice would be to let them
bleed out naturally.

13:15.263 --> 13:17.682
Hmm.

13:17.765 --> 13:21.894
Well, patience has never been
my strong suit.

13:24.605 --> 13:27.984
My mother used to say,
have patience,

13:28.068 --> 13:31.029
and the grass will be milk
soon enough.

13:31.112 --> 13:33.531
What does that mean?

13:33.614 --> 13:37.535
I don't know,
but it sounds wise, doesn't it?

13:49.255 --> 13:51.549
Mr. Merriweather,

13:51.632 --> 13:53.509
I got word
you were looking for me.

13:53.593 --> 13:56.096
Yes, thank you for coming,
Mr. Leary.

13:56.179 --> 13:59.599
So, as agreed, I hired
the men you recommended.

13:59.682 --> 14:02.477
But since then, they've
given me nothing but grief--

14:02.560 --> 14:05.771
taunting the Chinese,
starting fights.

14:05.855 --> 14:06.772
I'll talk to them.

14:06.856 --> 14:07.815
Those Donahue boys,

14:07.892 --> 14:10.026
they beat up
two skilled laborers today.

14:10.110 --> 14:12.862
I've lost hours
I can't afford to lose.

14:12.946 --> 14:14.405
I gave you my word, Mr. Leary.

14:14.489 --> 14:16.199
If your men can't
make it work--

14:16.282 --> 14:18.994
I'll take care of it,
all right?

14:22.788 --> 14:24.374
Donahues!

14:26.251 --> 14:27.502
Mr. Leary.

14:27.585 --> 14:28.628
Those chinks
you knocked around

14:28.711 --> 14:30.005
cost Merriweather a day's work.

14:30.088 --> 14:31.506
It's coming out
of your pockets.

14:31.589 --> 14:32.548
Mr. Leary, please.

14:32.632 --> 14:34.050
I promised you jobs.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.551
You got jobs.

14:35.635 --> 14:37.262
Keep your mouth shut
and your hands to yourself,

14:37.345 --> 14:38.304
and fucking do 'em.

14:38.388 --> 14:40.181
- You wouldn't.
- What the fuck you say to me?

14:40.265 --> 14:41.266
It ain't right
that we gotta work

14:41.349 --> 14:43.393
with these fucking chinks.

14:43.476 --> 14:45.979
And we're not the only ones
who feel that way.

14:48.933 --> 14:50.483
Is that right?

14:51.484 --> 14:54.154
Put your shovel down
and both of you get out.

14:54.237 --> 14:55.155
You can't--
you can't fire us.

14:55.238 --> 14:56.656
You think there aren't
10 other Irishmen

14:56.739 --> 14:59.242
waiting to take your place,
you ungrateful pricks?

14:59.325 --> 15:01.202
Get the fuck out!

15:05.206 --> 15:08.043
And that goes
for every one of you!

15:08.126 --> 15:09.377
You don't want this job,

15:09.460 --> 15:11.421
I'll give it to someone
who does.

15:12.672 --> 15:15.383
If you've got
a problem with that,

15:15.466 --> 15:19.012
well, you know where
to fucking find me.

15:30.690 --> 15:32.733
Let's go inside.

15:43.989 --> 15:46.206
Sergeant, a word, please.

15:46.289 --> 15:47.582
What is it?

15:50.501 --> 15:53.964
I'm trying to accomplish
something here.

15:54.047 --> 15:57.592
And I can only do so if
my chain of command is strong.

15:57.675 --> 16:00.803
I know you wanted the job.

16:00.886 --> 16:02.430
And if that's gonna be
an issue,

16:02.513 --> 16:05.010
well, I'm sure
there's plenty of work

16:05.100 --> 16:07.518
out there for a man
of your experience.

16:07.602 --> 16:09.104
I'm friends
with the Pinkertons.

16:09.187 --> 16:12.190
I can put in a good word.

16:15.568 --> 16:16.527
Is that all?

16:18.779 --> 16:20.448
I hope so.

16:35.630 --> 16:37.715
Who let you in here?

16:37.798 --> 16:39.634
Rutherford B. Hayes.

16:41.046 --> 16:44.222
I'm joking, sort of.

16:44.305 --> 16:46.891
I'm Agent Edmund Moseley,
United States Secret Service.

16:46.975 --> 16:47.892
We're part of the Treasury.

16:47.976 --> 16:49.810
Yes, I know
who the Secret Service is.

16:49.894 --> 16:52.522
What's your business here?

16:52.605 --> 16:54.565
Right to the point.

16:54.649 --> 16:57.235
Okay, then.

16:57.318 --> 16:58.444
I understand
you have a division

16:58.528 --> 17:00.530
assigned solely to Chinatown.

17:00.613 --> 17:02.615
I'll need to see
their personnel files.

17:04.492 --> 17:06.119
For what purpose?

17:06.202 --> 17:09.122
Well, because I'm gonna need
some of them to assist me.

17:09.205 --> 17:11.291
I'm also gonna need
an office and a holding cell.

17:13.459 --> 17:15.753
Mr. Moseley, is it?

17:17.047 --> 17:19.007
Whatever your business is here,

17:19.084 --> 17:21.676
it's got nothing to do
with me or my men.

17:21.759 --> 17:23.594
We have our hands full
as it is.

17:23.678 --> 17:27.807
And there's no time to give you
a fucking tour of Chinatown.

17:27.890 --> 17:32.020
So if there's nothing else,
I've got work to do.

17:33.939 --> 17:35.100
So it's gonna be
that kind of meeting?

17:35.190 --> 17:39.027
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

17:39.104 --> 17:42.613
I came in here as a courtesy,
Chief Atwood.

17:42.697 --> 17:46.111
The truth is I don't need your
permission or your blessing.

17:46.201 --> 17:49.162
In fact, I've already taken
a holding cell and an office.

17:49.245 --> 17:50.580
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

17:50.663 --> 17:52.582
I am a federal officer
empowered by

17:52.665 --> 17:54.709
the President
of the United States,

17:54.792 --> 17:57.378
and you will render
any assistance I ask for

17:57.462 --> 18:00.048
with a fucking smile,

18:00.125 --> 18:01.757
or I'll have you working
out of the basement

18:01.841 --> 18:05.386
while I make this office
mine own.

18:08.264 --> 18:09.890
Yeah,

18:09.975 --> 18:12.185
I guess it is
that kind of meeting.

18:22.445 --> 18:23.779
Easy, Uncle.

18:23.863 --> 18:25.198
I'm not here to collect.

18:26.782 --> 18:27.742
We're having some trouble

18:27.825 --> 18:29.369
with the printing press.

18:29.452 --> 18:31.787
Thought maybe you could come
take a look.

18:31.871 --> 18:34.374
What does the Tong need
with a press?

18:34.457 --> 18:35.791
That's not important.

18:35.875 --> 18:38.503
What's important is...

18:38.586 --> 18:40.165
I can clear your debt,

18:40.255 --> 18:41.756
if you can make it work.

18:41.839 --> 18:43.133
That's very generous of you,

18:43.216 --> 18:46.970
but these machines,
each one is different.

18:47.053 --> 18:48.346
I really wouldn't know
where to start.

18:48.429 --> 18:52.642
And my boy,
he's only just beginning.

18:52.725 --> 18:53.934
If you need to print
something,

18:54.019 --> 18:55.603
why not just use ours?

18:57.313 --> 18:59.774
Yeah, that won't work.

18:59.857 --> 19:01.651
Of course.

19:01.734 --> 19:05.947
Ah, I wish I could help.

19:09.284 --> 19:12.370
Yeah, me too.

19:13.788 --> 19:15.200
Guess I'll have to find
someone else.

19:19.961 --> 19:21.171
Are you stupid?

19:21.254 --> 19:22.172
Me?

19:22.255 --> 19:23.423
He could have wiped out
our debt.

19:23.506 --> 19:25.550
I crossed the South to get
away from gangsters like him,

19:25.633 --> 19:26.551
not to work for them.

19:26.634 --> 19:27.635
Father's right.

19:27.718 --> 19:28.803
We don't need that kind
of trouble around here.

19:28.886 --> 19:29.804
No one asked you.

19:29.887 --> 19:31.181
Why don't you go
and make dinner?

19:31.264 --> 19:32.217
Ah.

19:32.307 --> 19:34.600
Why don't you say that
to me again, huh?

19:34.684 --> 19:36.019
I dare you.

19:36.102 --> 19:39.439
That's enough,
the both of you.

19:39.522 --> 19:41.691
Go back to work.

20:05.966 --> 20:08.134
- Ah!
- Black four!

20:11.596 --> 20:12.930
Okay, step up.

20:13.014 --> 20:14.224
Who's next?

20:14.307 --> 20:15.433
Here we go.

20:21.940 --> 20:23.733
Two whiskey, please.

20:23.816 --> 20:24.900
Yeah, all right.

20:41.876 --> 20:44.504
From far away
across the sea

20:44.587 --> 20:45.880
A certain song
keeps haunting me

20:45.964 --> 20:47.257
Here you go.

20:47.340 --> 20:52.387
It brings me back
once more to Monte Cristo

20:52.470 --> 20:55.390
The music of your voice,
it seems

20:55.473 --> 20:58.018
Rings softly to me
in my dreams

20:58.101 --> 21:02.939
I can't forget those nights
in Monte Cristo

21:03.023 --> 21:05.816
Though many moons
have passed since then

21:05.900 --> 21:08.611
We'll meet again,
I wonder when

21:08.694 --> 21:13.824
Beneath the scarlet skies
in Monte Cristo

21:13.908 --> 21:16.619
And then I'll hold you close
once more

21:16.702 --> 21:19.164
The same as
many moons before

21:19.247 --> 21:24.835
Beneath the scarlet skies
in Monte Cristo

21:26.087 --> 21:30.050
Hong, let's get
the fuck out of here!

21:30.133 --> 21:31.301
What about the drinks?

21:31.384 --> 21:32.302
We'll get some at Ah Toy's.

21:32.385 --> 21:33.386
This place is bad luck.

21:33.469 --> 21:34.929
I want to fuck it away.

21:50.278 --> 21:52.280
Hong, let's go!

22:04.369 --> 22:06.336
Do you know these assholes?

22:08.129 --> 22:09.922
Never seen
either of them before.

22:10.006 --> 22:13.634
People around here know
not to rob one of my places.

22:15.095 --> 22:17.305
Must be from out of town.

22:20.850 --> 22:22.310
Where you taking 'em?

22:22.387 --> 22:23.769
I know a guy.

22:23.853 --> 22:26.272
Pays good money
for fresh corpses.

22:26.356 --> 22:27.392
No questions.

22:29.985 --> 22:32.397
Then I guess
it's your lucky day.

22:33.446 --> 22:35.448
Hey, cop.

22:38.159 --> 22:40.036
I'm not a cop.

22:40.120 --> 22:42.497
People try to rob you
at my place,

22:42.580 --> 22:44.457
you let them fucking rob you.

22:44.540 --> 22:46.542
Negro woman shoots white man,

22:46.626 --> 22:49.920
nobody cares
if it was self-defense.

22:50.005 --> 22:53.674
Her husband, my brother,
got killed for less.

22:56.594 --> 22:58.388
I didn't know.

22:58.471 --> 23:01.224
There's a lot you don't know.

23:01.307 --> 23:02.892
So know this.

23:02.976 --> 23:05.561
I no like you.

23:05.645 --> 23:06.854
I no like you live here.

23:06.937 --> 23:08.773
I no like you with her.

23:09.899 --> 23:12.235
You hide it well.

23:12.318 --> 23:13.903
Just give it time.

23:15.196 --> 23:17.282
Maybe I'll grow on you.

24:06.164 --> 24:07.665
You okay?

24:11.544 --> 24:13.254
What's done is done.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.717
We didn't have to do it
that way.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.552
If I didn't pull
that trigger,

24:19.635 --> 24:22.805
you'd be on your way
to Georgia right now.

24:22.888 --> 24:26.142
Far as I'm concerned,
wasn't much of a choice.

24:27.810 --> 24:31.314
If they found me,
others will too.

24:31.397 --> 24:32.857
Look, I know
what you're gonna say,

24:32.941 --> 24:34.442
but maybe we should just
get out of town.

24:34.519 --> 24:36.152
And where would we go,
Richard?

24:37.403 --> 24:39.405
I don't know.

24:39.489 --> 24:40.823
It's a big country.

24:40.906 --> 24:43.576
The price on your head says
it isn't big enough.

24:45.870 --> 24:49.665
Besides, where else

24:49.749 --> 24:53.878
is a Negro lady gonna run
a bar like this,

24:53.962 --> 24:56.089
make the money I do?

24:57.798 --> 25:00.135
There's nothing out there
for me.

25:04.347 --> 25:08.809
My only question for you is...

25:08.893 --> 25:13.189
am I worth the risk?

25:47.592 --> 25:49.642
You read the duck paper now?

25:52.020 --> 25:53.729
If we're gonna be working
with duck businesses,

25:53.813 --> 25:55.773
we have to understand
their world.

26:00.946 --> 26:02.488
Muchen reached out.

26:04.240 --> 26:05.658
He asked to meet.

26:09.162 --> 26:10.246
Really?

26:11.914 --> 26:13.874
I was surprised as you.

26:13.959 --> 26:15.543
Three Brothers are one
of the last tongs

26:15.620 --> 26:17.212
to resist joining us.

26:20.590 --> 26:22.675
You don't like Muchen?

26:22.758 --> 26:26.137
Our men have discipline,
honor.

26:26.221 --> 26:28.264
Not everyone can become
Long Zii.

26:30.891 --> 26:34.395
And once he answers to you,
he'll change.

26:34.479 --> 26:36.106
Zing didn't.

26:51.496 --> 26:53.206
Take the meeting.

26:53.289 --> 26:55.500
Bring Kong Pak.

26:55.583 --> 26:58.086
And if you think
Muchen is serious,

26:58.169 --> 26:59.754
I'll meet with him myself.

27:14.185 --> 27:16.062
This.

27:16.146 --> 27:17.563
If the ducks don't get us
one way,

27:17.647 --> 27:18.814
they'll get us another.

27:18.898 --> 27:20.650
Yet we're still here.

27:20.733 --> 27:22.652
We can't buy, we trade.

27:22.735 --> 27:25.655
They close our shops,
we sell in the streets.

27:25.738 --> 27:27.692
We're survivors.

27:27.782 --> 27:32.328
Maybe, but it gets pretty
exhausting after a while.

27:32.412 --> 27:34.830
Surviving?

27:34.914 --> 27:36.124
Being hated.

27:40.378 --> 27:41.629
Don't say it.

27:41.706 --> 27:43.464
They worship you.

27:43.548 --> 27:44.590
Hmm.

27:44.674 --> 27:45.710
They don't know me.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.552
They know you fought back.

27:47.635 --> 27:49.304
How's Lai?

27:49.387 --> 27:50.305
She plants.

27:50.388 --> 27:51.472
She stomps grapes.

27:51.556 --> 27:52.598
She has friends.

27:52.682 --> 27:54.225
She smiles.

27:54.309 --> 27:57.020
She hasn't touched a sword
since she left Chinatown.

27:58.438 --> 27:59.439
How about you?

28:00.773 --> 28:02.317
Think you'll pick one up again?

28:04.777 --> 28:05.903
I don't know.

28:07.822 --> 28:10.616
Out in Sonoma,
away from all of this...

28:13.536 --> 28:17.373
Nellie and I may actually
have a chance at something.

28:17.457 --> 28:18.874
Something...

28:20.961 --> 28:22.628
More than this?

28:25.715 --> 28:26.674
Yeah.

28:27.968 --> 28:29.635
Ah.

28:33.223 --> 28:34.724
Good for you.

28:43.399 --> 28:45.193
I'm not entirely sure

28:45.276 --> 28:47.320
what you'd like me to do,
Mr. Leary.

28:47.403 --> 28:49.030
What you fucking promised!

28:49.114 --> 28:50.906
Outlaw Chinese labor
once and for all.

28:50.991 --> 28:53.243
I built my platform
around it,

28:53.326 --> 28:57.372
but I can only accomplish
so much as interim mayor.

28:57.455 --> 28:59.540
Once I win the election,
I will be armed

28:59.624 --> 29:01.292
with the mandate of the people.

29:01.376 --> 29:02.710
These half measures,
they're--

29:02.787 --> 29:03.753
they're not gonna cut it.

29:03.836 --> 29:05.713
Don't forget,

29:05.790 --> 29:07.048
you need my votes.

29:07.132 --> 29:08.967
Oh, I'm well aware.

29:09.050 --> 29:11.261
But unfortunately
for the both of us,

29:11.344 --> 29:14.305
Thayer supports Chinese labor.

29:14.389 --> 29:17.142
If I lose, the Irish lose too.

29:17.225 --> 29:18.768
You may not like it,

29:18.851 --> 29:20.770
but we're stuck
with each other.

29:20.853 --> 29:22.397
You're right.

29:22.480 --> 29:23.808
I don't like it.

29:23.898 --> 29:26.234
You're just gonna
have to trust me.

29:26.317 --> 29:27.402
Trust you?

29:27.485 --> 29:28.528
Trust you?

29:28.611 --> 29:30.815
You are a fucking politician!

29:34.993 --> 29:37.954
So are you, Mr. Leary.

29:44.710 --> 29:47.213
If you fuck me on this...

30:12.655 --> 30:15.450
You're the, uh,
printer's daughter?

30:17.160 --> 30:19.120
My name is Yan Mi.

30:22.123 --> 30:23.868
I'm Ah Sahm.

30:23.959 --> 30:26.377
Yeah, I know who you are.

30:26.461 --> 30:28.964
So where's your broken press?

30:29.047 --> 30:30.006
But your father said--

30:30.090 --> 30:31.841
He didn't want to get
mixed up with gangsters.

30:31.924 --> 30:33.551
Can you blame him?

30:35.595 --> 30:36.881
And you do?

30:38.264 --> 30:41.017
I just want
what you promised us.

30:41.101 --> 30:42.393
So where's your press?

30:43.353 --> 30:44.980
You sure you can fix it?

30:45.063 --> 30:46.314
Not out here, I can't.

30:50.318 --> 30:52.612
Look, is there someone else
I should be talking to?

30:54.990 --> 30:55.900
Just me.

30:55.991 --> 30:57.367
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

30:57.450 --> 30:58.368
Come on.

30:58.451 --> 30:59.369
Great.

31:08.753 --> 31:11.172
Well, it's not broken.

31:11.256 --> 31:13.299
Then what are we doing wrong?

31:13.383 --> 31:15.010
How much time do you have?

31:17.220 --> 31:18.221
Your press is fine.

31:18.304 --> 31:19.597
You just have no idea
how to fine-tune it

31:19.680 --> 31:22.017
for the bills
you're trying to print.

31:22.100 --> 31:23.684
Who said anything
about bills?

31:23.768 --> 31:27.230
Green ink,
scraps lying around.

31:27.313 --> 31:29.440
It's pretty obvious.

31:31.609 --> 31:33.403
You think
you could do better?

31:34.237 --> 31:35.863
No.

31:35.941 --> 31:37.943
I know I could.

31:38.033 --> 31:39.617
What makes you so sure?

31:39.700 --> 31:42.203
Because I'm a printer,

31:42.287 --> 31:44.164
and you're a bunch
of gangsters.

31:47.375 --> 31:48.793
You believe this girl?

31:48.876 --> 31:51.004
It's obvious from the ink
splatter all over your press

31:51.087 --> 31:52.958
you're pouring your ink
from the top.

31:53.048 --> 31:54.215
You really should be
dabbing it on

31:54.299 --> 31:56.176
with a palette knife.

31:56.259 --> 31:57.718
You're over-inking like crazy.

31:57.802 --> 31:59.012
Go on.

31:59.095 --> 32:00.930
Well, if you don't know
not to pour,

32:01.014 --> 32:02.968
you're probably also
not letting the ink roll out

32:03.058 --> 32:05.601
long enough
before you start printing.

32:05.685 --> 32:07.228
Also...

32:09.730 --> 32:11.774
I'd be willing to bet
that your bills are turning out

32:11.857 --> 32:14.069
thicker than real ones.

32:14.152 --> 32:15.820
We're using
the same paper stock.

32:15.903 --> 32:18.864
No, you're not.

32:18.949 --> 32:20.986
It's close.

32:21.076 --> 32:22.910
Not close enough.

32:25.871 --> 32:28.541
I know what you need.

32:28.624 --> 32:31.127
And I know where to get it.

32:31.211 --> 32:32.587
Sounds like
she knows her shit.

32:36.841 --> 32:38.384
I guess we'll see.

32:40.636 --> 32:41.596
What's your end?

32:44.182 --> 32:48.061
I want you to leave
my father's shop alone.

32:48.144 --> 32:50.521
No more protection money,

32:50.605 --> 32:53.774
no collections of any kind,

32:53.858 --> 32:55.235
ever.

33:07.247 --> 33:09.332
Take her to get
whatever she needs.

33:17.298 --> 33:19.134
Guess that means
you're hired.

33:33.564 --> 33:37.777
Mr. Leary,
thank you for coming.

33:37.860 --> 33:40.196
What can I do for you,
Mr. Pierce?

33:40.280 --> 33:42.615
What did Lymon tell you?

33:42.698 --> 33:44.867
Only that you have
a business proposition for me.

33:44.951 --> 33:46.494
Hmm.

33:46.577 --> 33:48.829
As an entrepreneur,

33:48.913 --> 33:52.292
I have my hand in
a number of different pies.

33:52.375 --> 33:55.711
But the cornerstone
of my business

33:55.795 --> 33:58.881
is infrastructure,
which is railway lines,

33:58.965 --> 34:00.133
all of which require--

34:00.216 --> 34:01.259
Steel.

34:02.135 --> 34:03.970
Precisely.

34:04.054 --> 34:07.640
Unfortunately, there are only
so many manufacturers

34:07.723 --> 34:08.724
who can supply me with

34:08.808 --> 34:11.936
the quality of steel
that I require.

34:12.020 --> 34:14.689
And one of my competitors
is using

34:14.772 --> 34:16.524
his considerable
purchasing power

34:16.607 --> 34:19.194
to strongarm
these manufacturers

34:19.277 --> 34:22.697
into making him
their sole client.

34:22.780 --> 34:25.366
You'll forgive me if I don't
take up a collection for you.

34:27.112 --> 34:29.495
My point is,

34:29.579 --> 34:33.874
this competitor of mine
is not playing fair.

34:33.959 --> 34:37.170
So I can't afford to, either.

34:37.253 --> 34:41.757
We all have families to feed,
Mr. Leary.

34:41.841 --> 34:46.471
What I'd like is for you
to pay this man a visit

34:46.554 --> 34:51.559
and convince him to play fair.

34:51.642 --> 34:53.019
Mm.

34:55.021 --> 34:56.689
Is that what you
and your fat cat friends

34:56.772 --> 34:59.817
think of me, huh,

34:59.900 --> 35:02.988
that I'm just some thug
that'll do your bidding?

35:03.071 --> 35:05.949
What I think, Mr. Leary,

35:06.032 --> 35:10.203
is that I need men to build
my bridges, lay my track--

35:10.286 --> 35:14.499
working men in great numbers.

35:14.582 --> 35:18.378
But I can't hire 'em
if there's nothing to build.

35:23.466 --> 35:24.425
Let me take her.

35:24.509 --> 35:25.718
Thanks, Maggie.

35:35.478 --> 35:36.729
She's crawling now.

35:36.812 --> 35:37.730
Is she?

35:37.813 --> 35:39.107
Everywhere.

35:39.184 --> 35:40.900
- I can barely keep up.
- Hmm.

35:40.984 --> 35:43.528
I think she may be
the one that breaks me.

35:43.611 --> 35:45.363
Well, we knew
she'd be trouble.

35:51.827 --> 35:54.705
I need my family, Lucy.

35:55.790 --> 35:57.417
This is torture.

35:58.876 --> 36:01.296
You have a big heart, Bill,

36:01.379 --> 36:03.339
and a short memory.

36:03.423 --> 36:05.133
We'll come home
when things are settled.

36:06.842 --> 36:08.213
It was settled.

36:08.303 --> 36:10.388
That job was mine,
and then fucking Buckley!

36:10.471 --> 36:11.472
I--

36:12.765 --> 36:14.684
I am trying
to make things right.

36:14.767 --> 36:16.852
I swear I am.

36:16.936 --> 36:17.853
I know you are.

36:19.730 --> 36:20.648
Sorry, Luce.

36:20.731 --> 36:22.025
She's fussing again.

36:26.612 --> 36:27.572
It's good to see you.

36:49.594 --> 36:52.097
Bill.

36:52.180 --> 36:53.889
Evening, Horace.

36:53.974 --> 36:55.391
Can I say something?

36:55.475 --> 36:57.018
Is there anything short
of a blow to the head

36:57.102 --> 36:59.187
that could stop you?

36:59.264 --> 37:01.689
I was just wondering,

37:01.772 --> 37:05.443
would you ever consider
quitting the force entirely?

37:05.526 --> 37:07.195
A man of your experience,

37:07.272 --> 37:10.906
I'm sure you could find
a less dangerous line.

37:10.991 --> 37:13.952
You know, you're the second
person today to suggest that.

37:14.035 --> 37:15.245
Hmm.

37:15.328 --> 37:17.872
You could always
come work for me.

37:17.956 --> 37:20.285
I could use the extra help
at the factory.

37:20.375 --> 37:22.335
And who better than family?

37:23.586 --> 37:25.630
Did Lucy put you up to this?

37:28.174 --> 37:29.259
Can you blame her?

37:33.054 --> 37:36.432
In either case,
the offer stands.

37:47.312 --> 37:48.236
Calm the fuck down.

37:48.313 --> 37:49.404
He fucked us over.

37:49.487 --> 37:50.947
We'll find another job
without him.

37:54.867 --> 37:56.077
Bill.

37:56.161 --> 37:57.078
Whiskey.

37:57.162 --> 37:58.454
Sure thing, Bill.

38:00.456 --> 38:02.167
You can't say
shit like that here.

38:02.250 --> 38:04.085
I don't give a fuck!

38:04.169 --> 38:05.586
What the fuck
are they on about?

38:05.670 --> 38:06.629
Calm down!

38:06.712 --> 38:08.256
I can say whatever I want.

38:08.333 --> 38:09.257
You're gonna get us
kicked out.

38:09.334 --> 38:10.758
Settling up and going home,

38:10.841 --> 38:12.427
if they know
what's good for 'em.

38:14.595 --> 38:16.306
Fuckin'...

38:16.389 --> 38:17.765
Rough day?

38:19.344 --> 38:21.769
I'm out there all hours

38:21.852 --> 38:24.064
trying to get things done
for this lot,

38:24.147 --> 38:27.025
and all they do
is just bitch and moan,

38:27.108 --> 38:29.069
not a shred
of fucking gratitude.

38:30.445 --> 38:32.280
For men like you and me,

38:32.357 --> 38:34.490
never appreciated
for what we're doing.

38:34.574 --> 38:36.952
But if we stop doing it,
the whole world falls apart.

38:37.035 --> 38:38.411
It's falling apart anyway.

38:38.494 --> 38:39.745
Mm.

38:39.829 --> 38:41.247
Mr. Leary!

38:44.542 --> 38:47.712
You said at the factory that
if any of us had a problem,

38:47.795 --> 38:49.047
we'd know where to find you.

38:50.631 --> 38:51.967
Well, I do.

38:53.259 --> 38:55.380
I have a big fucking problem.

38:57.222 --> 38:58.848
Go home, boy.

38:58.931 --> 39:00.558
I really don't want
to have to explain to your dad

39:00.641 --> 39:02.060
what I did to you.

39:03.811 --> 39:05.021
What's the matter?

39:05.105 --> 39:07.523
Afraid I'll beat your ass
like that chink did?

39:25.625 --> 39:28.044
Connor...

39:28.128 --> 39:29.795
bring your fucking brother.

39:31.547 --> 39:33.633
Just had to open
your fucking mouth, didn't you?

39:33.716 --> 39:34.925
Come on.

39:37.720 --> 39:39.424
Silly boys.

39:55.363 --> 39:57.365
Come on!

40:02.245 --> 40:03.246
Get up!

40:03.329 --> 40:05.623
Get the fuck up!

40:05.706 --> 40:07.042
Let's go!

40:35.028 --> 40:37.948
Leary! Leary! Leary!

40:51.461 --> 40:53.796
Clean yourselves up, boys.

40:53.879 --> 40:55.423
Next round's on me.

41:13.566 --> 41:15.318
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:28.581 --> 41:32.252
Douglas, welcome.

41:32.335 --> 41:34.170
Look at you,

41:34.254 --> 41:36.172
a Winslow Homer painting
come to life.

41:38.216 --> 41:39.800
The country suits you.

41:39.884 --> 41:41.546
I wasn't expecting you
in person.

41:41.636 --> 41:42.720
Well, I wanted to see

41:42.803 --> 41:45.348
this new venture of yours
for myself

41:45.431 --> 41:47.850
and maybe sample
whatever it is I'm buying.

41:47.933 --> 41:50.395
I'm sure
we can accommodate that.

41:50.478 --> 41:51.729
Come, have a drink

41:51.812 --> 41:53.356
while your men fetch
the crates.

42:00.196 --> 42:02.407
So what's the verdict?

42:03.568 --> 42:06.369
A little plum,
a little spice.

42:08.246 --> 42:09.664
It's magnificent.

42:09.747 --> 42:11.207
Well, spread the word.

42:11.291 --> 42:13.293
God knows we need to sell
as much as we can.

42:15.378 --> 42:19.584
In that case, why don't I
just buy you out entirely?

42:19.674 --> 42:22.302
Excuse me?

42:22.385 --> 42:23.970
Nellie,
the federal government wishes

42:24.054 --> 42:27.307
to build a railroad
up the coast of California.

42:27.390 --> 42:29.594
Their survey identified
this valley

42:29.684 --> 42:31.436
as being the ideal route.

42:31.519 --> 42:34.689
They want to build
a railroad through my vineyard?

42:34.772 --> 42:38.359
They do, and they will.

42:38.443 --> 42:39.986
Now, I know
it's a great inconvenience,

42:40.070 --> 42:41.821
but I would like
to see you profit

42:41.904 --> 42:44.907
from this inevitability
by paying you

42:44.991 --> 42:47.577
fair market value
for the property

42:47.660 --> 42:49.614
before the state declares
eminent domain

42:49.704 --> 42:52.207
and forces you to take
pennies on the dollar.

42:53.708 --> 42:55.210
And why would you want
to buy a property

42:55.293 --> 42:56.836
that you can't keep or sell?

43:00.548 --> 43:03.009
You're building the railroad.

43:05.345 --> 43:08.348
I was awarded the contract
a few weeks ago.

43:08.431 --> 43:10.516
And while this does put me
in the awkward position

43:10.600 --> 43:13.853
of having to inform you,
it also puts me in the position

43:13.936 --> 43:15.188
to help an old friend.

43:15.271 --> 43:16.314
Well, if you really
want to help,

43:16.397 --> 43:17.607
then find another route.

43:17.690 --> 43:18.608
Believe me, I've tried.

43:18.691 --> 43:20.818
I lobbied Sacramento myself.

43:20.901 --> 43:22.612
This land is not for sale.

43:22.695 --> 43:24.864
Not to you, not to anyone.

43:24.948 --> 43:27.951
Nellie, this expansion
is going to happen.

43:28.034 --> 43:28.952
It's out of my hands.

43:29.035 --> 43:31.704
Well, so is my land.

43:31.787 --> 43:33.164
I have a room full of lawyers

43:33.248 --> 43:36.209
who will make that clear
to anyone who says otherwise.

43:38.086 --> 43:40.171
I understand
it's a lot to consider.

43:42.215 --> 43:43.758
I'll do what I can for you.

43:44.842 --> 43:46.636
Thank you for the wine.

43:46.719 --> 43:48.054
Thank you.

43:50.890 --> 43:52.142
Mm.

44:04.689 --> 44:07.615
How'd she take it?

44:07.692 --> 44:09.325
She'll come around.

45:01.002 --> 45:02.503
How's it going?

45:04.749 --> 45:07.883
She's been at it all night.

45:07.968 --> 45:09.754
These look like dog shit.

45:09.844 --> 45:12.555
Those are the scraps.

45:12.638 --> 45:14.390
This is the product.

45:36.162 --> 45:38.831
Holy fucking shit.

45:41.334 --> 45:42.752
We're in business.

45:45.088 --> 45:46.422
The truth is,

45:46.506 --> 45:51.094
there is no such thing
as a harmless Celestial.

45:51.177 --> 45:52.637
Mayor Blake died

45:52.720 --> 45:55.640
at the hands of a meek,
unassuming Chinaman

45:55.723 --> 45:58.768
his wife had fed
and sheltered for years.

45:58.851 --> 46:00.936
They simply cannot be trusted.

46:02.188 --> 46:05.441
If elected, I intend
to honor the Blake legacy

46:05.525 --> 46:09.487
of American jobs
for American workers

46:09.570 --> 46:12.198
and keep our women
and children safe

46:12.282 --> 46:15.076
from these foreign invaders.

46:18.288 --> 46:21.207
Of course, we all bemoan
the tragic circumstances

46:21.291 --> 46:23.876
of Mayor Blake's passing,

46:23.960 --> 46:26.004
but perhaps
we should spend less time

46:26.087 --> 46:28.589
focusing on what is wrong
with this city

46:28.673 --> 46:31.467
and more on what is
very right with it--

46:31.551 --> 46:35.096
you, its people,

46:35.180 --> 46:37.098
the American family.

46:42.687 --> 46:47.025
Like you, I believe
in the American family.

46:48.818 --> 46:50.320
That's mine right over there.

46:50.403 --> 46:53.489
My wife, Celeste, and our
children, Miles and Annabelle.

46:55.366 --> 46:59.204
You deserve a mayor
who will fight for your family

46:59.287 --> 47:01.706
as hard as I do for mine.

47:13.878 --> 47:15.678
People like a family man.

47:15.761 --> 47:17.222
There's no getting around it.

47:18.473 --> 47:20.100
Which doesn't mean
they won't eventually

47:20.183 --> 47:22.227
recognize you as the candidate
of true substance.

47:22.310 --> 47:26.147
But you gotta get out there,
press the flesh.

47:30.318 --> 47:33.113
You can't win a war without
getting a little bloody,

47:33.196 --> 47:34.405
I'm afraid.

47:39.369 --> 47:41.287
Thank you.

47:41.371 --> 47:43.039
Thank you for your--

47:51.131 --> 47:53.174
Mayor Buckley.

47:53.258 --> 47:55.176
Pardon me.

47:55.260 --> 47:56.177
Thank you.

47:56.261 --> 47:58.138
Thank you for coming out today.

48:00.223 --> 48:01.391
Catherine Archer.

48:01.474 --> 48:03.226
I volunteered
for Councilman Waithe,

48:03.309 --> 48:05.478
promoting his
educational policies.

48:05.561 --> 48:06.854
I see.

48:06.931 --> 48:09.190
I know you think
that didn't go your way,

48:09.274 --> 48:10.733
but stay the course.

48:10.816 --> 48:13.736
Thayer is just a pretty face
spouting platitudes.

48:13.819 --> 48:16.906
Any voter with half a brain
can see that.

48:16.990 --> 48:20.285
It's obvious you understand
the economics of San Francisco,

48:20.368 --> 48:23.163
the deep quandary we're in.

48:23.246 --> 48:24.622
And I intend
to help your cause,

48:24.705 --> 48:26.041
in whatever way I can.

48:26.124 --> 48:28.001
Well, thank you
for saying that.

48:28.084 --> 48:29.377
My card.

48:32.047 --> 48:35.133
Mr. Mayor,
we should keep moving.

48:35.216 --> 48:36.884
Wait.

48:40.138 --> 48:41.181
There.

48:41.264 --> 48:43.849
Now you're ready
to greet your public.

48:50.731 --> 48:52.108
Mr. Mayor?

48:56.982 --> 49:01.492
It was my first time ever

49:01.576 --> 49:05.038
on a ship of any kind.

49:05.121 --> 49:06.872
I was terrified.

49:06.957 --> 49:09.750
I didn't know what to expect.

49:09.834 --> 49:14.297
But I knew that whatever
happened to me in America,

49:14.380 --> 49:15.631
well, it couldn't be any worse

49:15.715 --> 49:19.385
than what had already happened
to me back in China.

49:19.469 --> 49:24.009
Being forced into marriage
by a violent warlord,

49:24.099 --> 49:27.768
chained to his bedside,
you know, sometimes for days.

49:27.852 --> 49:31.356
How did you survive
such horrors?

49:31.439 --> 49:33.566
A part of me didn't.

49:37.445 --> 49:40.615
But that part was weak.

49:42.783 --> 49:46.031
And when it died,

49:46.121 --> 49:47.705
why, I became stronger.

49:50.166 --> 49:53.503
Well, I'm sure
our guest is spent.

49:53.586 --> 49:56.006
And I promised her
a tour of the house.

49:56.089 --> 49:59.217
So, ladies, until next week.

50:01.011 --> 50:03.679
And here's the dressing room.

50:05.431 --> 50:07.183
My goodness.

50:07.267 --> 50:08.184
I know.

50:08.268 --> 50:10.270
It's a bit much.

50:10.353 --> 50:12.730
My husband works
for the Bank of California.

50:12.813 --> 50:14.815
We have so many occasions
to attend.

50:14.899 --> 50:18.403
So he allows me my indulgences.

50:24.450 --> 50:26.702
Do you have dresses
of this sort in your culture?

50:30.498 --> 50:32.250
No.

50:46.222 --> 50:48.558
I'd like you to have this.

50:48.641 --> 50:49.892
Really?

50:49.976 --> 50:52.437
It's just an evening dress,
dear, not the Hope Diamond.

50:52.520 --> 50:54.439
- I couldn't.
- I insist.

50:55.773 --> 50:57.567
Why don't you try it on?

51:03.949 --> 51:07.112
You never know when you might
need a good evening dress.

51:10.455 --> 51:12.915
May you outlive
all your enemies.

51:18.504 --> 51:21.216
Li Yong, I know Mai Ling
wishes to absorb us,

51:21.299 --> 51:23.259
but I have
a different proposal.

51:23.343 --> 51:25.470
We acknowledge
the Long Zii's takeover

51:25.553 --> 51:27.973
of all Three Brothers'
businesses.

51:28.056 --> 51:31.267
But in exchange,
we will retain our name

51:31.351 --> 51:32.978
and control of all enforcement

51:33.061 --> 51:35.396
and collections
in our territory.

51:55.666 --> 51:57.502
Kill them.

52:28.241 --> 52:29.409
Kong!

53:20.460 --> 53:22.045
Enough!

53:24.797 --> 53:26.799
You all know me.

53:26.882 --> 53:28.051
Make no mistake.

53:28.134 --> 53:30.386
Joining the Long Zii is
the only path forward

53:30.470 --> 53:34.015
for Chinatown, for all of us.

53:35.976 --> 53:37.102
Tell them.

53:38.853 --> 53:41.731
She may have your balls
in a box,

53:41.814 --> 53:43.899
but she'll never have mine.

53:46.027 --> 53:47.695
I understand.

54:33.533 --> 54:34.993
I don't like being followed.

54:35.076 --> 54:37.703
Yes, you've communicated that
very clearly.

54:42.917 --> 54:44.169
Secret Service?

54:44.252 --> 54:45.420
You've heard of us?

54:45.503 --> 54:47.172
Good.

54:47.255 --> 54:48.714
That'll save me some time.

54:51.259 --> 54:52.302
It took me four months

54:52.385 --> 54:54.887
to trace the counterfeit plates
to San Francisco,

54:54.971 --> 54:56.431
two more to locate
the operators

54:56.514 --> 54:59.225
and the transport routes
from print to distribution.

54:59.309 --> 55:01.186
Unfortunately, by the time
I actually caught up with them,

55:01.269 --> 55:02.728
the plates were gone,
and most of the operators

55:02.812 --> 55:04.064
went down shooting.

55:04.147 --> 55:06.441
What does this
have to do with me?

55:06.524 --> 55:08.526
The last surviving idiot
told me his boss

55:08.609 --> 55:10.820
had been buying guns
from the Chinese.

55:10.903 --> 55:14.074
So here I am,

55:14.157 --> 55:16.909
talking to a man
who knows the terrain.

55:16.993 --> 55:19.579
You need the Chinatown Squad.

55:19.662 --> 55:20.997
I'm not a cop anymore.

55:22.248 --> 55:23.624
It might help you
with this conversation

55:23.708 --> 55:25.918
if you just assume
I know a little less than God,

55:26.002 --> 55:28.421
but a lot more than you think.

55:29.589 --> 55:31.757
I know all about
the Chinatown Squad,

55:31.841 --> 55:33.843
and I know you quit

55:33.926 --> 55:36.346
after socking your superior
in the jaw.

55:37.347 --> 55:42.060
I'm guessing that makes you
a different sort of fella,

55:42.143 --> 55:43.644
the kind I could work with.

55:46.982 --> 55:48.316
Not interested.

55:48.393 --> 55:49.484
Sure, you are.

55:49.567 --> 55:50.986
Yeah, why is that?

55:51.069 --> 55:52.653
Because I'm the one man
who can keep you

55:52.737 --> 55:54.948
from being dragged
back to Georgia in chains.

55:56.116 --> 55:59.577
Like I said, assume I know
a lot more than you think.

56:00.328 --> 56:02.080
Relax, Lee.

56:02.163 --> 56:04.457
Here's my offer.

56:04.540 --> 56:06.411
You guide me through Chinatown,

56:06.501 --> 56:08.336
help me find
those missing plates,

56:08.413 --> 56:11.089
and I clean up
your Georgia mess permanently.

56:12.966 --> 56:16.927
Be nice, wouldn't it,
to live a quiet life out here

56:17.012 --> 56:18.804
with that pretty colored girl,

56:18.888 --> 56:20.723
never looking
over your shoulder again?

56:23.809 --> 56:26.896
I'm wanted for murder.

56:26.980 --> 56:28.189
You know that, right?

56:29.565 --> 56:30.984
Nobody's perfect.

56:33.569 --> 56:35.363
Take the night.

56:35.440 --> 56:36.822
Think about it.

56:38.908 --> 56:40.445
I'll be in touch.
