00:25.559 --> 00:27.359
Fair warning, Frosty!

00:27.394 --> 00:30.062
You're skating on thin ice.

00:30.097 --> 00:31.296
That you, Stormy?

00:31.331 --> 00:32.798
Your hair still on fire?

00:33.967 --> 00:35.467
Allow me to cool it off.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.370
Oh, well. Allow me

00:38.405 --> 00:40.439
to treat you to some sweets.

00:44.611 --> 00:47.879
Ronald, you're not flirting
with Killer Frost, are you?

00:47.914 --> 00:49.448
Why? Don't you think
she's cute?

00:49.816 --> 00:51.683
She is your polar opposite

00:51.718 --> 00:53.652
and she happens to be
a criminal.

00:53.687 --> 00:56.188
Since we tracked her here
to Gotham City,

00:56.223 --> 00:58.190
perhaps we should
alert the Batman?

00:58.225 --> 01:00.325
Like I already don't have
enough adult supervision,

01:00.360 --> 01:01.626
Professor Stein.

01:01.661 --> 01:03.262
Whoa! Huh?

01:06.399 --> 01:09.835
All right. If I'm gonna
melt her cold, cold heart,

01:09.870 --> 01:12.204
I'll need to
crank up the heat!

we call Batman.

01:58.818 --> 02:01.487
I'm putting your travel plans
on hold, Freeze.

02:02.189 --> 02:04.489
How did you manage to find me?

02:04.524 --> 02:05.891
Echolocation?

02:05.926 --> 02:08.327
-(BEEPING)
-Sub-zero readings

-No.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.602
Right on time.

Frosty, Frosty,
Frosty, Frosty...

02:33.153 --> 02:36.021
PROFESSOR STEIN:
The freak accident
that created Killer Frost

02:36.056 --> 02:38.323
enables her to harness heat

02:38.358 --> 02:39.958
and convert it into cold.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.661
So, what have we
learned, Ronald?

02:42.696 --> 02:45.163
(SIGHS) Never fight
frost with fire.

02:45.198 --> 02:46.298
I get it, I... Hey!

02:46.600 --> 02:47.999
Why aren't you
a floating head?

02:48.034 --> 02:50.235
'Cause you are currently
out cold.

02:52.305 --> 02:53.705
Which doesn't
grant you permission

02:53.740 --> 02:55.707
to daydream during class,
by the way.

02:56.309 --> 02:57.342
What? (CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
I don't even...

02:57.377 --> 02:58.710
I don't know
what you're talking about.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.212
That's... That's actually
a little rude.

03:01.781 --> 03:02.914
Look, Teach,

03:02.949 --> 03:04.783
Frosty's kinda new to this
whole "supervillain" thing.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.218
Right? So, who knows?

03:06.253 --> 03:08.486
Maybe some of my winning charm

03:08.521 --> 03:10.589
can get her over
to the winning team.

03:11.358 --> 03:14.560
Many thanks for accepting
my invitation.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.828
(SCOFFS) Like I'd miss
an opportunity

03:16.863 --> 03:19.164
to hang with the Mr. Freeze,

03:19.199 --> 03:21.099
the Sultan of Sub-Zero.

03:22.435 --> 03:23.569
I am such a fan.

03:23.803 --> 03:25.470
Truly, Killer Frost,

03:25.505 --> 03:30.041
it is I who am humbled
by your mastery over cold.

03:30.076 --> 03:31.777
-(GIGGLES)
-After all,

03:32.178 --> 03:35.647
I fear heat, while you are
able to reverse it.

03:35.682 --> 03:36.748
It's how I roll.

03:36.783 --> 03:38.183
But really,
I'm here to serve.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.251
Oh, that's good,

03:39.286 --> 03:41.052
because freezing all of Gotham

03:41.087 --> 03:44.122
in order to rule it
as my own personal kingdom

is something I do not feel
I can accomplish...

05:09.309 --> 05:11.076
We need to
stop that Freezo, pronto.

05:14.214 --> 05:15.280

Infiltrate Freeze's airship
while I provide air cover.

disable that freeze ray.

Good to see you, too!

"It only leads to heartache."

pay attention in class.

07:31.050 --> 07:32.217
On occasion. Yeah.

But you do realize,
if we disconnect Frost,
