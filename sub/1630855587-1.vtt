00:01.569 --> 00:03.671
(fire whooshing)

00:20.921 --> 00:24.325
(tense orchestral music)

00:50.951 --> 00:55.123
(tense orchestral
music continues)

01:15.409 --> 01:18.479
(soft intense music)

01:51.679 --> 01:53.347
(door unlocking)

01:53.347 --> 01:56.384
(door clicking)

01:56.384 --> 01:57.518
(door thudding)

01:57.518 --> 02:00.053
(door locking)

02:09.397 --> 02:10.631
(light switch clicking)
(party poppers popping)

02:10.631 --> 02:12.032
- Happy birthday!
(Lyra shrieking)

02:12.032 --> 02:13.967
- (laughing) Oh, my
God, you arseholes.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.469
- Happy Birthday, Lyra.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.638
- [Lyra] Oh, thank you, I
thought you'd forgotten.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.807
- We wouldn't forget
you, our little Lyra.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.041
- Aw!
- Drink?

02:21.041 --> 02:22.243
- Yeah, we wouldn't
pass up an opportunity

02:22.243 --> 02:24.578
to have a party, would we, eh?

02:24.578 --> 02:26.914
- Hello, Ursa, I thought
you were in Cumbria.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.449
- Yeah, we had to make
it believable somehow

02:28.449 --> 02:30.651
and someone might have
let something slip.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.885
- Sneaky. (laughing)

02:31.885 --> 02:33.987
I'm surprised you
two kept it a secret.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.556
- Well, it doesn't say
anywhere in the "Bible,"

02:35.556 --> 02:37.225
that you can't
surprise your friends.

02:37.225 --> 02:39.560
Plus it's omission
and not lying, so.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.829
- [Lyra] Thank you, I
was definitely surprised.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.063
- You're welcome.

02:44.798 --> 02:45.633
- Okay.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.669
- [Ursa] You had a
hard day at work?

02:48.669 --> 02:51.405
- Yeah, every day's
been bad at the moment.

02:51.405 --> 02:53.741
- I'm sorry that things
have been bad at the moment.

02:55.175 --> 02:58.078
- How about you just forget
about it for one night,

02:58.078 --> 02:59.146
yeah?
- Yes, please.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.914
- Okay, we've got some booze.

03:00.914 --> 03:01.915
- Oh, that's good,
'cause I'm running low.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.917
- Nice place you've got here.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.254
- [Ursa] Yeah, you should see
next door, they've got a pool.

03:06.254 --> 03:08.256
- Bloody hell, I could get
used to living like this,

03:08.256 --> 03:11.659
beats my one-bedroom flat.
(Ursa and Lyra laughing)

03:11.659 --> 03:14.295
- So what's on the
agenda for tonight?

03:15.429 --> 03:16.364
- Party!

03:16.364 --> 03:17.197
- Whoo!

03:19.099 --> 03:24.104
(upbeat pop music)
(group chattering)

03:48.962 --> 03:53.967
(upbeat pop music)
(group chattering)

04:05.078 --> 04:08.482
- How did you see that?
- There you go.

04:08.482 --> 04:09.483
Okay.
- Whoo!

04:11.485 --> 04:13.521
- This is as exciting
as you said it would be,

04:13.521 --> 04:15.022
it's actually boring.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.657
- I'm sorry, didn't know
I was gonna have company.

04:16.657 --> 04:19.192
- Not you, let's do
something more exciting.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.161
Let's play a drinking game.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.397
- Like what?
- Ah, Truth or Dare.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.865
- And how's that
a drinking game?

04:24.865 --> 04:26.266
- It's not a drinking game,

04:26.266 --> 04:27.768
I just wanna do something
more interesting.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.006
- Okay, I'm up for it.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.575
- You're always up for it.

04:34.575 --> 04:35.743
(both laughing)

04:35.743 --> 04:37.378
- Well, I'm definitely in.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.346
- Ooh!

04:40.080 --> 04:41.248
- I'm out.

04:41.248 --> 04:43.183
- Come on, Leo,
don't be a snowflake.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.055
- Does that mean
you're tapping out too?

04:48.055 --> 04:50.458
- No, I'm in as long
as we keep it tame,

04:50.458 --> 04:53.761
I'm not gonna break any
commandments over a stupid game.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.963
- I'll be gentle, promise.

04:58.566 --> 04:59.700
- Fine, I'm in.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.535
- All right, all right!

05:03.036 --> 05:04.572
Leo,

05:04.572 --> 05:07.040
have you two...

05:08.208 --> 05:09.242
- I said tame.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.911
- Keep it PG or else I'm out.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.713
- All right, all right.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.081
Lyra, Truth or Dare?

05:15.048 --> 05:16.550
- Truth.

05:16.550 --> 05:21.321
- Okay, how come you live
in this house on your own?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.791
- [Ursa] The truth, Lyra.

05:23.791 --> 05:26.259
- Can we start with
someone else first?

05:26.259 --> 05:28.662
- Come on, just answer,
then we'll move on.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.233
- It's my house, so I live here.

05:33.233 --> 05:34.602
- Yeah, but why don't you just
sell it and move to the city?

05:34.602 --> 05:36.904
- I'm not selling it,
it's my parents' place.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.906
- Yeah, but why-
- That's enough.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.408
She answered.

05:40.408 --> 05:41.609
- Fine, your turn.

05:43.276 --> 05:46.747
- Okay, Phoenix, does
asking intrusive questions

05:46.747 --> 05:48.749
make you feel like a big man?

05:48.749 --> 05:50.418
(all laughing)
- It's Truth or Dare.

05:50.418 --> 05:53.787
- Okay, how come you're not
in the military anymore?

05:53.787 --> 05:54.622
- Oh.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.760
- PTSD, you saw my record.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.294
You didn't ask Truth or Dare.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.530
- Oh, silly me.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.432
Maybe I forgot when you
went for the jugular.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.467
- Hardly, it's a
legitimate question.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.935
- Mate, you know
her parents died.

06:07.935 --> 06:10.538
Why have you gotta
be such a dick, huh?

06:10.538 --> 06:12.673
- All right, let's
just calm down, okay.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.041
Look, it's Lyra's birthday,

06:14.041 --> 06:16.343
can we just stop with
the name calling?

06:16.343 --> 06:19.680
- Okay, it's my turn.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.683
Ursa, Truth or Dare?

06:22.683 --> 06:23.517
- Dare.

06:24.685 --> 06:28.288
- I dare you to
jump in the pool.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.558
- (laughing) This
has got interesting.

06:30.558 --> 06:31.892
- That's breaking and entering.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.293
- Oh, but, but, but, but,

06:36.363 --> 06:37.865
this is Ursa's turn.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.299
- You know, I still need
to live next to this guy.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.502
- A dare's a dare,
if she forfeits,

06:41.502 --> 06:45.739
she'll have to live with the
stigma of being a chicken.

06:45.739 --> 06:50.744
- Oh, good job that
I'm not a chicken then.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.918
- Oh, shit, she's
actually gonna do it.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.152
(Lyra laughing)
(chair clattering)

06:59.152 --> 07:00.988
- I don't think this
is a good idea, guys.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.990
- Oh, it's not such a bad idea.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.192
Carina knows that my
neighbor's out for the weekend,

07:05.192 --> 07:06.860
so he's not back till tomorrow.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.996
- Not just a pretty face.

07:08.996 --> 07:12.700
- And I've got swimming
costumes, shall we go?

07:22.409 --> 07:25.345
(soft tense music)

07:33.887 --> 07:34.722
- Wait for me.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.359
I don't wanna miss this.

07:39.359 --> 07:42.596
- Hurry up then. (laughs softly)

07:50.704 --> 07:52.372
Who's a chicken now?

07:53.306 --> 07:55.976
(Ursa laughing)

08:00.781 --> 08:03.984
- I know, isn't it?
- Are you sure this is safe?

08:03.984 --> 08:06.319
- It's not smart,
but it is safe.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.388
My neighbor works
nights on weekends,

08:08.388 --> 08:10.558
so he won't be
back till tomorrow.

08:10.558 --> 08:11.792
- Only if you're sure.
- Mm-hm.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.061
- I don't wanna get
you into trouble.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.896
- Once they've burned
off that sexual tension,

08:15.896 --> 08:17.497
then it'll calm down.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.233
(Norma laughing)

08:21.669 --> 08:24.304
- If he is naked
again, I am gonna puke.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.907
- Ew, I don't wanna.
- I can't every single time.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.109
- That's so gross.
- We go swimming,

08:29.109 --> 08:32.279
he's like everything-
(water splashing)

08:33.280 --> 08:34.147
- Did she?
(Lyra laughing)

08:34.147 --> 08:35.515
- Oh, she's done it.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.085
(all laughing)

08:38.085 --> 08:40.788
(water sloshing)

08:45.425 --> 08:46.627
- There you are.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.762
- You missed it,
she jumped right in.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.430
- How is the water?

08:50.430 --> 08:53.433
- Yeah, it's lovely,
it's actually salt,
it's not chlorine.

08:53.433 --> 08:54.602
Get in.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.303
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.271
- Are you a bunch of chickens?
- I'm no chicken.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.773
- I'm not missing out.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.612
(water splashing)

09:04.612 --> 09:07.180
(all laughing)

09:08.548 --> 09:11.351
- It's okay, we can go before
her neighbor comes back.

09:11.351 --> 09:12.285
It'll be fun.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.021
- Birthday girl coming through!

09:14.021 --> 09:16.857
(water splashing)

09:19.126 --> 09:19.960
- Oh!

09:19.960 --> 09:23.230
(water sloshing)

09:23.230 --> 09:26.066
(water splashing)

09:31.404 --> 09:33.306
(water splashing)

09:33.306 --> 09:36.043
(water sloshing)

09:39.747 --> 09:40.981
- [Phoenix] Welcome to the club,

09:40.981 --> 09:43.416
I didn't think you'd even dare.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.053
- Why does everyone have
such low expectations of me?

09:46.053 --> 09:47.655
- Ah, 'cause your dad's a vicar.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.589
- [Norma] Ah, he
actually prefers Pastor.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.091
- What, like Father Tagliatelle?

09:51.091 --> 09:52.726
- No, no, no, Pastor.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.327
- What's the difference?

09:54.327 --> 09:57.197
- Well, they're interchangeable,
Pastor Joel, you know, he-

09:57.197 --> 09:59.232
- Oh, it was a
rhetorical question.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.101
- Wow, you really are a dick.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.271
- Oh, nice one, Norma.

10:04.271 --> 10:08.575
(upbeat pop music)
(water sloshing)

10:08.575 --> 10:11.411
(all laughing)

10:11.411 --> 10:16.416
(upbeat pop music)
(water sloshing)

10:20.020 --> 10:23.390
(group chattering)

10:23.390 --> 10:28.395
(upbeat pop music)
(water sloshing)

10:35.368 --> 10:37.437
(Lyra and Carina
chattering quietly)

10:37.437 --> 10:40.207
(water sloshing)

10:43.610 --> 10:46.413
- Where are you going?
- I need to pee.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.982
- Well, don't go too far.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.417
- I won't.

10:50.417 --> 10:53.320
(soft tense music)

10:54.387 --> 10:57.725
(soft orchestral music)

11:07.667 --> 11:09.336
These are some digs.

11:23.416 --> 11:28.421
(urine trickling)
(soft tense music)

11:38.431 --> 11:41.534
(soft pulsing music)

11:45.705 --> 11:48.108
(group chattering)

11:48.108 --> 11:50.010
- Oh God, what's Phoenix doing?

11:50.010 --> 11:51.711
- Is he still not back yet?

11:51.711 --> 11:52.780
- I bet he's lost.
- Yeah,

11:52.780 --> 11:54.347
lost on purpose more like.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.683
- He'd better not
be up to something.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.518
- [Norma] Are you
going to look for him?

11:58.518 --> 11:59.853
- Yeah, are you coming?

11:59.853 --> 12:00.821
- I'll come.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.857
- I just think I'll stay here.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.959
- I'm coming too, I wanna
see how big the house is.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.494
- We're not going
into the house.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.029
We're just gonna go find Phoenix

12:09.029 --> 12:10.497
and then go back to my place.

12:11.464 --> 12:14.667
(water sloshing)

12:14.667 --> 12:16.569
- Are we safe here?

12:16.569 --> 12:18.371
- I'll stay with
you, keep you safe.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.309
- Oh, get a room.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.519
- [Norma] I really
don't like this.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.387
- Lyra said it's fine,
if the neighbor said

12:34.387 --> 12:36.489
we can use the pool,
then it's no problem.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.158
- Yeah, but I still
don't like it.

12:41.995 --> 12:45.065
You know, I don't really
like Phoenix either.

12:45.065 --> 12:47.434
- Hm.
- He's, he's a bit too brash.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.602
- And unpredictable.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.403
- Yeah.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.007
Hey, can we go when
they come back?

12:55.175 --> 12:57.177
- Are you sure, I mean,
Lyra's your friend,

12:57.177 --> 12:59.679
don't you wanna stay
a little longer?

12:59.679 --> 13:01.181
- Yeah, I do, but
I just don't know

13:01.181 --> 13:03.283
what we'll get into if we stay.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.352
- Okay, well, just
wish her happy birthday

13:05.352 --> 13:07.187
and then we'll go, yeah.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.588
- Yeah, okay, fine.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.024
- Come on, let's just enjoy
the pool for now, huh?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.695
We have it all to ourselves.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.264
- Leo, stop. (laughing)

13:17.264 --> 13:19.532
- Okay, okay, I know
where to draw the limit.

13:19.532 --> 13:20.733
- They could be back any minute.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.535
- Oh, a minute is all I need.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.604
- That does not
sound good for you.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.974
- (laughing) Time is relative.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.877
- Hm, I think we
should just enjoy this.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.411
- Mm-hm.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.147
(water sloshing)

13:38.919 --> 13:40.487
- Wow!

13:40.487 --> 13:43.390
- Geez, this place is huge.

13:43.390 --> 13:46.793
(tense orchestral music)

13:49.329 --> 13:51.498
What does your neighbor do?

13:51.498 --> 13:54.267
- He's a doctor or something,
I don't really know.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.335
He was friends with my parents,

13:55.335 --> 13:56.937
so I've never really met him.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.238
- You know, maybe I
should be a doctor,

13:58.238 --> 13:59.907
if you can afford
a place like that.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.741
- Can we just focus
on finding Phoenix?

14:01.741 --> 14:03.243
I don't wanna be
snooping around here,

14:03.243 --> 14:05.078
if my neighbor comes back early.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.079
- Is that likely?

14:06.079 --> 14:07.580
- Just in case.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.617
Oh, shit.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.019
- Maybe he's in there.

14:12.019 --> 14:14.421
- Why would he break in?

14:14.421 --> 14:16.656
- It's Phoenix, does
there need to be a reason?

14:16.656 --> 14:19.259
- Yeah, open door's
pretty much an invitation.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.827
- Who said the door was open?

14:20.827 --> 14:22.829
- Look at it, that's
state of the art,

14:22.829 --> 14:24.932
I don't think anyone
could break into that,

14:24.932 --> 14:26.499
least of all, an
idiot like Phoenix.

14:26.499 --> 14:27.767
- If that's the case,

14:27.767 --> 14:29.937
then he's a bigger idiot
than I thought, come on.

14:29.937 --> 14:32.139
- Yes, we get to see inside.
- Mm-hm.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.807
(Ursa laughing)

14:37.310 --> 14:40.280
(door thudding)

14:40.280 --> 14:41.848
- Hitch.

14:41.848 --> 14:44.217
- Don't worry,
there's no one here.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.453
- What if he comes home
early and just walks in?

14:46.453 --> 14:48.655
It's not worth the risk.
- Fine.

14:48.655 --> 14:51.558
Oh, he's gotta be here
somewhere, like where can he be?

14:52.892 --> 14:55.395
Oh, maybe a side down there.

14:55.395 --> 14:58.065
- Oh, looks like a basement,
who the hell has a basement?

14:58.065 --> 15:00.700
- People like this
have basements to
store wine and stuff.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.972
- Come on, let's just go in.

15:14.481 --> 15:17.985
(gentle orchestral music)

15:21.221 --> 15:22.222
Phoenix.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.523
- Check this out.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.998
- What are you doing, how
did you even get down here?

15:30.998 --> 15:33.233
- Just punched a military
sequence into the keypad

15:33.233 --> 15:34.067
and the door opened.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.502
- How?

15:35.502 --> 15:38.338
- It's a fail safe,
like a kill code.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.740
Most military compounds
have the same system.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.244
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

15:44.244 --> 15:45.845
- You shouldn't be down here.

15:45.845 --> 15:49.449
- Oh, don't be a pansy,
there's no one down here.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.952
(gentle orchestral music)

16:03.596 --> 16:06.533
- What is it?
- It's an egg, duh!

16:06.533 --> 16:10.437
- An egg? Like a pretty
big dinosaur laid that.

16:12.372 --> 16:15.708
- [Carina] What kind of
doctor did you say he is?

16:15.708 --> 16:17.410
- I don't know.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.913
(gentle orchestral music)

16:35.328 --> 16:36.963
But don't touch it.

16:36.963 --> 16:39.632
- Relax, I'm not gonna break it.

16:39.632 --> 16:43.136
(gentle orchestral music)

16:51.911 --> 16:53.480
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.747
(eggshell cracking)
(soft tense music)

16:54.747 --> 16:57.417
- What was that?
- I don't know.

16:59.186 --> 17:02.589
(phone ringing)

17:02.589 --> 17:03.590
- Hello.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.092
- Lyra, what's going on?
- What?

17:05.092 --> 17:06.993
- [Norma] What's going
on, did you find Phoenix?

17:06.993 --> 17:08.261
- Yeah, we found him,

17:08.261 --> 17:10.297
but something really
strange is happening.

17:10.297 --> 17:11.931
- What's happening?

17:12.765 --> 17:14.134
What is that?

17:14.134 --> 17:15.702
- [Norma] I-I'm
coming to get you.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.437
- No, Norma, Norma,
stay where you are.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.806
Stay there, we'll be right out.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.040
- This is crazy.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.275
- Yeah, I don't
like this at all.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.111
- I think we need
to get out of here.

17:25.512 --> 17:26.846
No, don't get too close.

17:26.846 --> 17:27.847
- It's okay.

17:28.781 --> 17:29.882
- Phoenix.
- Ssh!

17:29.882 --> 17:30.950
- Don't, don't.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.785
- It's just an egg.

17:32.785 --> 17:36.223
(soft tense music)

17:36.223 --> 17:37.056
- Hello.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.491
- [Norma] Get out now.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.459
- What?

17:39.459 --> 17:41.027
(Norma speaking indistinctly)

17:41.027 --> 17:42.329
- I can't hear you.
- The owner, he's coming back.

17:42.329 --> 17:43.563
- Shit!
- Right, we need to go

17:43.563 --> 17:44.797
and hide, we need
to go and hide now.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.032
- Get the hell out of here.

17:46.032 --> 17:47.200
- Lyra!
- Okay.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.337
Phoenix.

17:50.337 --> 17:53.240
(soft tense music)

17:57.877 --> 18:00.046
Phoenix, we need to go.

18:00.046 --> 18:01.481
(door clicking)
(soft tense music)

18:01.481 --> 18:02.882
(Carina gasping)

18:02.882 --> 18:04.917
(door thudding)
- Shit, someone's coming.

18:04.917 --> 18:05.752
- Hide!

18:08.421 --> 18:11.991
- Let's go, Phoenix,
we need to go.

18:11.991 --> 18:14.861
(soft tense music)

18:25.405 --> 18:28.074
(door thudding)

18:33.780 --> 18:36.383
(door locking)

18:40.119 --> 18:42.789
(keys jangling)

18:55.635 --> 18:58.638
(footsteps tapping)

19:03.976 --> 19:06.313
(door clicking)

19:06.313 --> 19:09.249
(soft tense music)

19:10.883 --> 19:13.753
(phone thudding quietly)

19:13.753 --> 19:16.389
(keyboard tapping)

19:16.389 --> 19:19.292
(soft tense music)

19:25.765 --> 19:30.303
- What? (gasping)

19:36.843 --> 19:39.612
(Micha laughing)

19:49.422 --> 19:52.325
(object clattering)

19:52.325 --> 19:55.262
(soft tense music)

20:06.773 --> 20:09.676
(door handle rattling)

20:09.676 --> 20:10.610
- It's locked.

20:10.610 --> 20:13.813
- There must be another way out.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.282
(keyboard tapping)

20:15.282 --> 20:18.217
(computer beeping)

20:19.352 --> 20:21.288
- You're cold, Lacerta.

20:23.122 --> 20:25.292
That's your name, Lacerta.

20:28.395 --> 20:31.864
If you can hear me, that's
where you come from.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.703
We found you on an asteroid
that we thought originated

20:36.703 --> 20:38.305
in the Lacerta constellation.

20:39.806 --> 20:43.543
You traveled 102 light years
to reach our solar system.

20:46.913 --> 20:51.250
We sent out an unmanned probe
to intercept the asteroid

20:51.250 --> 20:54.754
and we discovered it was
debris from a planet,

20:54.754 --> 20:57.557
that disappeared
hundreds of years ago.

20:58.925 --> 21:02.495
We found remnants of
an advanced species

21:02.495 --> 21:04.163
on what remained of that planet

21:05.332 --> 21:08.735
(soft tense music)

21:08.735 --> 21:11.938
and we searched for
months and months.

21:12.939 --> 21:16.042
Finally, we found an egg.

21:17.009 --> 21:20.212
We found you. (laughing)

21:20.212 --> 21:24.116
But I couldn't watch what
they had planned for you.

21:24.116 --> 21:28.521
You are something very
special, very special

21:30.357 --> 21:33.025
and I was afraid they were,
they were gonna use you,

21:33.025 --> 21:35.362
gonna use you and I
couldn't have that,

21:35.362 --> 21:36.796
I couldn't have that.

21:37.930 --> 21:41.267
So I brought you here with me,

21:43.403 --> 21:45.137
where you'll be safe.

21:46.539 --> 21:49.976
(gentle orchestral music)

21:51.544 --> 21:54.146
(phone beeping)

21:58.150 --> 21:59.952
There you are.

21:59.952 --> 22:01.888
(object thudding quietly)

22:01.888 --> 22:04.391
(lights buzzing)

22:04.391 --> 22:06.393
It's okay, you're
safe here with me.

22:06.393 --> 22:08.561
This is for your own good.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.566
I've got something that'll help.

22:16.436 --> 22:19.338
(soft tense music)

22:30.950 --> 22:31.784
It's okay.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.286
Come closer.

22:35.755 --> 22:39.258
(object thudding quietly)

22:40.760 --> 22:42.795
It's all right,
you-you can trust me.

22:46.499 --> 22:47.934
I won't hurt you.

22:49.436 --> 22:52.472
(Lacerta growling softly)

22:52.472 --> 22:55.374
(soft tense music)

23:17.329 --> 23:20.800
(eerie orchestral music)

23:37.484 --> 23:40.653
(intense orchestral music)

23:40.653 --> 23:42.021
Stop.

23:42.021 --> 23:44.023
(heart beating)
(intense orchestral music)

23:44.023 --> 23:45.658
S-stop!

23:45.658 --> 23:47.259
Lacerta!

23:47.259 --> 23:52.264
Stop!
(Lacerta clicking)

23:55.101 --> 23:57.504
- It's locked, we need to
get the hell out of here.

23:57.504 --> 23:59.005
- Calm down, look at me, okay,

23:59.005 --> 24:01.207
we can't just leave
them both down there,

24:01.207 --> 24:02.609
so we need to go and get them.

24:02.609 --> 24:03.576
- I know.

24:03.576 --> 24:04.276
- Okay.
- I know.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.612
- Okay, come on.

24:06.679 --> 24:07.614
- Uh!

24:07.614 --> 24:09.181
(Micha thudding to floor)

24:09.181 --> 24:10.783
Lacerta, stop!

24:10.783 --> 24:12.184
(Lacerta clicking)

24:12.184 --> 24:13.352
Lacerta, stop!

24:14.453 --> 24:15.522
Please, stop!

24:16.388 --> 24:19.626
(intense orchestral music)

24:19.626 --> 24:21.027
Uh!

24:21.027 --> 24:23.930
(Lacerta clicking)

24:25.698 --> 24:30.703
Uh! (breathing fearfully)

24:37.276 --> 24:41.480
(electronic locks banging)

24:41.480 --> 24:44.150
(door creaking)

24:48.755 --> 24:51.891
(blow thudding)

24:51.891 --> 24:53.225
You can't leave.

24:54.426 --> 24:57.329
(Lacerta clicking)

24:58.497 --> 25:03.235
(flesh ripping)
(Micha screaming)

25:06.072 --> 25:11.077
(Micha groaning)
(Lacerta growling)

25:14.981 --> 25:18.417
(tense orchestral music)

25:21.854 --> 25:24.523
(Micha choking)

25:29.596 --> 25:32.431
(Lacerta clicking)

25:32.431 --> 25:35.935
(solemn orchestral music)

25:48.948 --> 25:53.285
(solemn orchestral
music continues)

26:14.473 --> 26:15.541
- Is he gone?

26:17.243 --> 26:18.911
What was that thing?

26:19.879 --> 26:22.649
(Micha groaning)

26:24.083 --> 26:26.686
- We need something
to stop the bleeding.

26:26.686 --> 26:27.553
- Like what?
- I don't know,

26:27.553 --> 26:29.055
a towel or something.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.824
It's okay, it's
okay, I'm a nurse.

26:31.824 --> 26:34.661
- M-mustn't let him leave.

26:34.661 --> 26:35.728
- What?

26:35.728 --> 26:36.829
- Promise me,

26:38.364 --> 26:41.734
I don't want them to
get their hands on him.

26:41.734 --> 26:42.568
- Who?

26:43.736 --> 26:45.004
- Them.

26:45.004 --> 26:47.239
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

26:47.239 --> 26:48.741
Phoenix, hurry up.

26:49.776 --> 26:53.279
(solemn orchestral music)

26:54.413 --> 26:57.249
- Come on, we've
got to do something.

27:02.254 --> 27:04.523
- Micha, Micha,
Micha, stay with me.

27:04.523 --> 27:06.125
Stay with me, yeah.

27:08.527 --> 27:09.595
Stay with me.

27:11.698 --> 27:12.531
Yeah.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.367
Micha.

27:15.367 --> 27:18.871
(solemn orchestral music)

27:49.268 --> 27:51.904
(Lyra sobbing)

28:08.687 --> 28:09.922
This is your fault.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.157
- Me, what did I do?

28:11.157 --> 28:13.525
- You came down
here nosing around

28:13.525 --> 28:16.195
and look what you've
done, now he's dead.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.696
You killed him!

28:17.696 --> 28:19.031
- I didn't kill anyone.
- He would still be alive,

28:19.031 --> 28:20.800
if it wasn't for you!

28:22.101 --> 28:24.971
(Lyra sobbing)

28:24.971 --> 28:25.805
- Lyra.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.109
Hey, hey, hey.

28:42.188 --> 28:44.623
(phone ringing)

28:44.623 --> 28:46.158
- [Norma] Lyra, what's going on?

28:46.158 --> 28:47.693
The whole place is locked down.

28:49.295 --> 28:50.129
- He's dead.

28:51.363 --> 28:52.899
- Wait, what do you mean?

28:52.899 --> 28:54.566
- [Lyra] He's dead.

28:54.566 --> 28:55.802
- What happened?

28:55.802 --> 28:57.703
- [Lyra] That thing got him.

28:57.703 --> 28:58.805
- What thing?

29:00.072 --> 29:00.973
What thing?

29:02.875 --> 29:04.811
Shit, there's no signal.
- What's, what's wrong?

29:04.811 --> 29:06.145
- I don't know, she just said,

29:06.145 --> 29:08.147
that someone called
Micha's dead.

29:08.147 --> 29:10.482
- The neighbor, dead, h-how?

29:10.482 --> 29:13.820
- I don't know, but something
is seriously wrong here.

29:13.820 --> 29:16.889
- Okay, okay, well, um,
what do, what do we do?

29:16.889 --> 29:18.724
- I think we need to
get the doors open

29:18.724 --> 29:20.159
and just, just get them out.

29:20.159 --> 29:22.394
- That place is like Fort
Knox, we'll never get in there.

29:22.394 --> 29:24.496
- We need to try, my
friends are in there.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.367
- Okay, okay, let's go.

29:28.367 --> 29:29.601
- Okay.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.370
(intense music)
(leaves rustling)

29:31.370 --> 29:33.572
- What was that?

29:33.572 --> 29:35.007
- What?
- Get back in the pool.

29:35.007 --> 29:36.843
- Why?
- Just do it!

29:36.843 --> 29:40.179
(water splashing)

29:40.179 --> 29:43.349
(Lacerta clicking)

29:43.349 --> 29:46.252
(soft tense music)

29:49.355 --> 29:51.357
- What did you see?

29:51.357 --> 29:52.191
- I-I don't know.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.695
(Lacerta clicking)

29:56.695 --> 29:58.364
Keep your head down.

29:59.365 --> 30:01.033
- I'm scared.
- Ssh!

30:01.033 --> 30:03.369
Just take a deep breath, okay.

30:03.369 --> 30:04.703
(both inhaling deeply)

30:04.703 --> 30:06.939
(water sloshing)

30:06.939 --> 30:11.944
(owl hooting)
(tense orchestral music)

30:14.981 --> 30:16.382
- Where is it?

30:16.382 --> 30:17.816
- It's over that way.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.285
- [Phoenix] How do you know
how to work that thing?

30:19.285 --> 30:21.387
- [Lyra] I don't, I just
figure that Micha wants to know

30:21.387 --> 30:23.089
where the alien is
if it gets captured.

30:23.089 --> 30:24.656
- Who is this guy?

30:24.656 --> 30:26.725
- I don't know, I-I'm
starting to rethink

30:26.725 --> 30:28.094
everything my
parents ever told me,

30:28.094 --> 30:29.595
like maybe they knew
something about this.

30:29.595 --> 30:30.762
- No, I doubt it,
it's just a neighbor.

30:30.762 --> 30:33.132
- Well, I hope
it's that innocent.

30:33.132 --> 30:36.502
(water sloshing)
(Leo gasping)

30:36.502 --> 30:39.405
(soft tense music)

30:45.244 --> 30:48.414
(Lacerta clicking)

30:48.414 --> 30:51.483
(soft intense music)

30:53.185 --> 30:56.322
- Ah!
(water sloshing)

30:57.756 --> 31:00.292
- (gasping) What the
hell is that thing?

31:00.292 --> 31:04.863
- I don't know, but it-it seems
to be afraid of the water.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.765
- I think you're right.

31:06.765 --> 31:09.468
Maybe it's like a
self-preservation
thing that animals do?

31:09.468 --> 31:11.137
- Yeah, but what is it?

31:11.137 --> 31:12.371
What you want?

31:12.371 --> 31:13.705
- I don't think it
can understand you.

31:14.773 --> 31:16.275
- Is-is it an animal?

31:16.275 --> 31:19.145
- [Norma] That's not like any
type of animal I've ever seen.

31:19.145 --> 31:20.812
- What's it doing?

31:20.812 --> 31:22.281
(Lacerta growling)

31:22.281 --> 31:24.116
- I think it's
looking for something.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.954
- We need to get out of here
though and that door's locked,

31:27.954 --> 31:29.188
so what do you suggest?

31:31.123 --> 31:33.859
- Um, I-I think
that we need a code

31:33.859 --> 31:35.294
to deactivate the lockdown.

31:35.294 --> 31:36.128
- Give it here.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.633
(phone buzzing)
(Phoenix sighing)

31:41.633 --> 31:43.635
- What happens if there's
no more attempt after that?

31:43.635 --> 31:45.904
- I know, but it could
be worse than this.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.307
- Worse than this, what
could be worse than this?

31:48.307 --> 31:49.575
- That there has to be
another way out of here,

31:49.575 --> 31:51.343
we can't be locked in here.

31:56.915 --> 31:59.551
(phone ringing)

32:02.921 --> 32:04.223
- Don't, wait here.

32:04.223 --> 32:07.326
- Ssh, just keep
a lookout, okay?

32:07.326 --> 32:09.996
(phone ringing)

32:16.535 --> 32:17.603
(intense music)
Oh!

32:17.603 --> 32:19.171
(Norma gasping)
(water sloshing)

32:19.171 --> 32:22.441
(Lacerta growling)
- Leo!

32:22.441 --> 32:26.012
(intense orchestral music)

32:30.382 --> 32:31.950
(water splashing)

32:31.950 --> 32:35.354
(Lacerta shrieking)

32:35.354 --> 32:38.290
(water splashing)

32:38.290 --> 32:43.295
(skin sizzling)
(Lacerta groaning)

32:46.765 --> 32:48.034
(phone beeping)
- Voicemail.

32:48.034 --> 32:49.635
- Oh, call the police,
just call the police.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.103
- No, no, we can't
call the police.

32:51.103 --> 32:52.771
We broke into my
neighbor's house.

32:52.771 --> 32:54.140
There is a dead body downstairs

32:54.140 --> 32:55.474
and there's an alien
running around.

32:55.474 --> 32:56.775
- Police, we can't
call the police,

32:56.775 --> 32:58.210
I'm not going back, I'm
not supposed to be here.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.478
- Calm down.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.047
- Oh, I need to get out of here.

33:02.248 --> 33:03.882
Oh, I forgot the water.

33:03.882 --> 33:05.117
- No, Phoenix, wait.
- Wait.

33:05.117 --> 33:06.618
- Where does he
think he's going?

33:06.618 --> 33:08.120
- Oh, he's AWOL, isn't he?

33:08.120 --> 33:09.921
So if the police catch
him, he'll get in trouble.

33:09.921 --> 33:11.390
- Could this day get any worse?

33:11.390 --> 33:14.326
- We need to stick
together, girls, come on.

33:20.799 --> 33:22.268
- Leo. (sobbing)

33:22.268 --> 33:25.271
(water sloshing)

33:25.271 --> 33:28.774
(solemn orchestral music)

33:38.517 --> 33:40.919
Eternal rest, grant unto him.

33:42.488 --> 33:47.493
O Lord, and let Your perpetual
light shine upon him.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.328
May he rest in peace.

33:50.429 --> 33:52.264
(solemn orchestral music)

33:52.264 --> 33:57.269
Love always in the name
of Jesus. (sobbing)

34:05.777 --> 34:08.947
(tense pulsing music)

34:12.284 --> 34:13.119
- Guys.

34:17.289 --> 34:18.124
Guys?

34:21.127 --> 34:21.960
Phoenix?

34:25.063 --> 34:25.897
Phoenix.

34:27.133 --> 34:30.302
(tense pulsing music)

34:32.138 --> 34:36.375
(Lacerta clicking softly)

34:36.375 --> 34:39.545
(tense pulsing music)

34:45.417 --> 34:48.086
(door clicking)

34:49.821 --> 34:52.491
(door thudding)

34:52.491 --> 34:57.496
(tense pulsing music)
(Carina breathing fearfully)

35:05.003 --> 35:06.338
(handle rattling)
- Oh, come on, come on.

35:06.338 --> 35:07.406
(hand thudding)

35:07.406 --> 35:08.240
Oh, God.

35:17.015 --> 35:20.286
(door handle rattling)

35:31.563 --> 35:34.800
(door handle rattling)

35:40.806 --> 35:43.242
- [Carina] Lyra, is that you?

35:45.311 --> 35:48.380
(door creaking)

35:48.380 --> 35:51.283
(soft tense music)

35:53.719 --> 35:56.488
(Lacerta clicking)
(intense music)

35:56.488 --> 35:59.391
(soft tense music)

36:07.666 --> 36:10.602
(Lacerta clicking)

36:12.170 --> 36:15.006
(Carina screaming)

36:15.006 --> 36:17.476
(owl hooting)

36:17.476 --> 36:18.310
- Phoenix.

36:21.146 --> 36:23.249
It's moving.
- Where is it?

36:23.249 --> 36:25.016
- It's on the other side of
the house back where we were.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.118
but it's moving and moving fast.

36:27.118 --> 36:28.754
- And where's Phoenix?
- Well, if he's smart,

36:28.754 --> 36:30.322
he's gonna be hiding somewhere,

36:30.322 --> 36:32.691
but if he's out in the
open, then he's screwed.

36:33.925 --> 36:34.760
- Wait,

36:35.994 --> 36:37.263
where's Carina?

36:38.497 --> 36:40.299
- Oh, crap.

36:40.299 --> 36:41.667
- Should we go back?

36:41.667 --> 36:42.801
- We're gonna have to.

36:43.935 --> 36:46.338
- What if the
alien is out there?

36:46.338 --> 36:48.340
- It's gonna be okay.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.641
- I don't think I just-
- We'll be fine,

36:49.641 --> 36:51.443
we'll be fine, we'll
just find Phoenix,

36:51.443 --> 36:54.546
find Carina and find
a way out of here.

36:54.546 --> 36:55.614
- Okay, yeah.

37:01.453 --> 37:04.323
(Lacerta clicking)

37:05.491 --> 37:07.158
- Did you hear that?

37:10.061 --> 37:13.899
Let's just find them
and get out of here.

37:13.899 --> 37:17.068
(tense humming music)

37:22.641 --> 37:26.312
(Phoenix breathing heavily)

37:27.679 --> 37:29.381
- Come on, come on.

37:29.381 --> 37:32.318
(Lacerta clicking)

37:37.989 --> 37:39.891
(footsteps tapping)

37:39.891 --> 37:42.828
(soft tense music)

37:45.997 --> 37:48.834
(Lacerta roaring)

37:51.837 --> 37:53.439
(door clicking)
- Phoenix, Phoenix.

37:53.439 --> 37:54.873
(footsteps thudding)

37:54.873 --> 37:56.342
- Okay, this way.

37:57.743 --> 38:00.412
(door creaking)

38:01.780 --> 38:04.683
(soft tense music)
(Lacerta growling)

38:04.683 --> 38:06.352
(door handle rattling)

38:06.352 --> 38:07.619
- Come on.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.356
(Phoenix gasping)
(Lacerta growling)

38:10.356 --> 38:13.425
(soft intense music)

38:16.261 --> 38:19.431
(door clicking)

38:19.431 --> 38:22.368
(soft tense music)

38:29.240 --> 38:30.208
Good puppy.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.979
(Lacerta growling)

38:35.046 --> 38:37.449
Good puppy, Lacerta.

38:37.449 --> 38:38.717
(Lacerta clicking)

38:38.717 --> 38:39.551
That's it.

38:40.586 --> 38:42.153
I mean you no harm.

38:43.389 --> 38:47.759
(soft tense music)
(Lacerta clicking)

38:47.759 --> 38:50.596
We had a moment back
there, remember?

38:50.596 --> 38:52.063
I'm your friend.

38:52.931 --> 38:56.402
(Lacerta growling softly)

38:57.302 --> 38:58.303
Good doggie.

38:59.137 --> 39:02.007
(soft tense music)

39:08.279 --> 39:09.848
- It's moving.

39:09.848 --> 39:10.682
- Yeah.

39:11.650 --> 39:13.485
- It's moving.

39:13.485 --> 39:17.923
(Lacerta growling)
(Phoenix screaming)

39:17.923 --> 39:20.358
- He got, he got him, he got.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.029
- It works every time.

39:25.363 --> 39:28.867
(Lacerta growling)
(Phoenix screaming)

39:28.867 --> 39:33.872
(blows thudding)
(Phoenix groaning)

39:39.044 --> 39:42.047
(Lyra gasping)

39:42.047 --> 39:43.281
- Ssh!

39:43.281 --> 39:44.215
(blows thudding)
(Lacerta growling)

39:44.215 --> 39:46.785
We need to go back this way.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.286
We'll go together.

39:49.621 --> 39:53.892
(Lacerta growling softly)

39:53.892 --> 39:56.828
(soft tense music)

40:00.365 --> 40:02.568
- We need to find Carina.

40:02.568 --> 40:05.504
(soft tense music)

40:07.906 --> 40:09.140
- She's gone.

40:10.642 --> 40:12.143
- How do you know?

40:14.145 --> 40:18.984
- It got her, I saw her
body in one of the rooms.

40:18.984 --> 40:19.818
- Carina.

40:23.922 --> 40:28.026
- Look, we need to go,
okay, find a way out.

40:28.026 --> 40:30.996
(soft tense music)

40:34.099 --> 40:36.768
(door creaking)

40:43.374 --> 40:44.175
Ssh!

40:49.581 --> 40:50.682
(vase shattering)

40:50.682 --> 40:53.051
(all gasping softly)

40:53.051 --> 40:56.588
(Lacerta growling)

40:56.588 --> 40:57.388
Hide!

40:58.524 --> 41:01.359
(soft tense music)

41:10.368 --> 41:13.038
(door creaking)

41:22.247 --> 41:26.718
(intense music)
(Lacerta thudding)

41:26.718 --> 41:29.888
(Lacerta growling)

41:29.888 --> 41:33.391
(Lacerta clicking)

41:33.391 --> 41:35.794
(Ursa gasping fearfully)

41:35.794 --> 41:38.730
(soft tense music)

41:40.298 --> 41:43.301
(object clattering)

41:46.972 --> 41:50.441
(Lacerta growling softly)

41:52.978 --> 41:57.949
(Lacerta roaring)
(eerie discordant music)

42:01.519 --> 42:04.422
(Lacerta thudding)

42:06.091 --> 42:08.493
(Lacerta growling)

42:08.493 --> 42:11.763
- It sounded like it
was communicating,

42:13.531 --> 42:14.933
calling out to something.

42:14.933 --> 42:16.501
- What like others?

42:18.036 --> 42:20.438
He was speaking to his friend?

42:20.438 --> 42:23.341
(object thudding quietly)
(Ursa gasping fearfully)

42:23.341 --> 42:25.811
- Guys, we're just
like sitting ducks.

42:25.811 --> 42:29.147
We've got to get the fuck
out of here, come on.

42:31.116 --> 42:33.785
(door clicking)

42:42.127 --> 42:44.796
(door thudding)

42:46.632 --> 42:49.167
- [Norma] This is how I got in.

42:53.639 --> 42:56.975
- Thank God you called
out when you did.

42:56.975 --> 42:57.809
- Thank you,

42:59.510 --> 43:01.046
you saved us.

43:01.046 --> 43:02.681
- Yeah, well, I couldn't exactly

43:02.681 --> 43:04.082
leave you in there, could I?

43:07.352 --> 43:09.921
- What happened to
Leo, where's Leo?

43:18.063 --> 43:19.164
- It-it got him.

43:22.333 --> 43:23.168
- When?

43:25.704 --> 43:27.706
- When we were in the pool.

43:29.675 --> 43:31.509
The house had just
been locked down

43:31.509 --> 43:33.879
and we were about to
come and get you out.

43:34.913 --> 43:35.847
It-it got him.

43:41.386 --> 43:42.553
- Oh, my God.

43:46.524 --> 43:47.859
I'm so sorry.

43:52.097 --> 43:54.032
- How did you get away?

43:56.968 --> 43:59.237
- I don't know, it just-

43:59.237 --> 44:00.605
- [Lyra] Lacerta.

44:02.373 --> 44:03.208
- What?

44:03.208 --> 44:05.711
- His name's Lacerta.

44:05.711 --> 44:09.715
- The alien, they found it
in the Lacerta constellation.

44:09.715 --> 44:11.883
- It's an alien?

44:11.883 --> 44:15.253
- Yeah.

44:15.253 --> 44:17.555
- Well, I-I thought
aliens didn't exist.

44:18.924 --> 44:19.725
- Believe it.

44:24.629 --> 44:29.400
- When, when we were in
the pool, I, I splashed it

44:29.400 --> 44:31.002
and it really didn't like it.

44:31.002 --> 44:36.007
(skin sizzling)
(Lacerta groaning)

44:38.944 --> 44:40.979
I think maybe there's
something in the water,

44:40.979 --> 44:44.449
that might harm it, it didn't
wanna come anywhere near us,

44:44.449 --> 44:46.918
when we were in the pool.

44:46.918 --> 44:49.020
- It's something in the water?

44:49.020 --> 44:49.855
- [Norma] Yeah.

44:51.456 --> 44:52.991
- Salt.

44:52.991 --> 44:56.828
- It-it must react to its skin
or the wet stuff on its skin.

44:58.263 --> 45:01.499
- So what are we gonna do, just
like throw it in the ocean?

45:01.499 --> 45:03.668
- No, the nearest
ocean's two hours away

45:03.668 --> 45:05.670
and I don't want that
thing in my boot.

45:05.670 --> 45:08.774
- Well, what are we gonna
do, what are we gonna do?

45:15.613 --> 45:18.216
- Look, I've got
a plan, follow me.

45:23.454 --> 45:27.292
I think the window
malfunctioned or something.

45:28.559 --> 45:31.229
(feet thudding)

45:34.132 --> 45:37.502
(feet thudding)

45:37.502 --> 45:38.736
(feet thudding)

45:38.736 --> 45:40.806
Look, my dad's church
is near here, okay,

45:40.806 --> 45:42.740
he'll know what to do.
- What's your dad gonna do?

45:42.740 --> 45:43.975
He's just a priest.

45:43.975 --> 45:45.811
- Well, he wasn't always
a priest, you know.

45:45.811 --> 45:47.412
- Come on, it's as
good a plan as any

45:47.412 --> 45:49.314
and we've got to get as far
away from here as possible.

45:49.314 --> 45:51.649
- Okay.
- Let's go, it's this way.

45:54.385 --> 45:57.722
(classical organ music)

46:20.846 --> 46:25.016
(classical organ
music continues)

46:50.608 --> 46:54.779
(classical organ
music continues)

47:03.088 --> 47:05.590
(crow cawing)

47:10.561 --> 47:12.563
Hopefully there's no
one in confession.

47:12.563 --> 47:14.632
- [Ursa] I don't think
your dad would have time

47:14.632 --> 47:17.068
in his schedule to hear
all my confessions.

47:17.068 --> 47:18.436
(all laughing)
- Let's go.

47:26.344 --> 47:29.014
(door clicking)

47:34.585 --> 47:37.255
(door thudding)

47:45.330 --> 47:46.131
- Dad.

47:49.968 --> 47:50.801
Dad.

47:54.605 --> 47:57.642
- Oh, he can't have
followed us here, can he?

47:57.642 --> 47:58.476
- Check.

48:00.378 --> 48:02.713
- No, that's okay, it's
still at the house.

48:08.119 --> 48:08.954
- Dad.

48:10.221 --> 48:11.056
- Norma?

48:14.960 --> 48:18.196
What, what? (laughing)

48:25.003 --> 48:26.404
What happened?

48:30.075 --> 48:32.743
- We were celebrating
a birthday party.

48:35.246 --> 48:37.815
- It-it was a monster.

48:37.815 --> 48:40.418
- A monster, what are
you talking about?

48:40.418 --> 48:42.220
- Brace yourself, Father,

48:42.220 --> 48:44.655
this isn't gonna be easy
to wrap your head around.

48:44.655 --> 48:46.824
- Look, if something
has hurt my little girl,

48:46.824 --> 48:47.758
I want to know.

48:51.596 --> 48:52.430
- Um...

48:54.832 --> 48:57.335
My neighbor was growing

48:57.335 --> 49:01.839
an animal in his basement

49:03.008 --> 49:06.677
and it has got free

49:07.712 --> 49:09.614
and killed my neighbor

49:11.349 --> 49:12.850
and three of our friends

49:15.553 --> 49:19.357
and it almost killed us,
but we managed to escape.

49:26.231 --> 49:28.233
- Norma, I need to know,

49:33.804 --> 49:37.042
are you girls doing the drugs?

49:37.042 --> 49:39.810
- Dad, you need to listen to me.

49:39.810 --> 49:42.913
Okay, that-that thing,
it's coming for us.

49:46.051 --> 49:47.252
It killed Carina.

49:51.489 --> 49:52.723
It killed Leo.

49:53.791 --> 49:55.260
- [Joel] Leo's dead?

49:56.227 --> 49:57.062
- Yeah.

49:58.229 --> 49:59.597
- Oh, honey.

50:04.569 --> 50:08.439
So this thing is killing people?

50:11.409 --> 50:14.312
Right, well, where is it now?

50:14.312 --> 50:17.014
- It's still in my
neighbor's house.

50:17.014 --> 50:20.085
- What we're gonna do is
we're gonna go into the back,

50:20.085 --> 50:22.587
I'm gonna make some tea and
we're going to ring the police.

50:22.587 --> 50:25.256
- No, we can't do that.
- Why not, why not?

50:25.256 --> 50:29.427
- H-how are we gonna
explain to the police,

50:29.427 --> 50:32.930
that we broke into
my neighbor's house,

50:32.930 --> 50:35.933
set an animal free

50:35.933 --> 50:38.769
and watched our
friends get killed

50:38.769 --> 50:42.373
and now we're just hiding
in a church drinking tea?

50:48.546 --> 50:50.281
You heard what Micha said,

50:51.482 --> 50:54.985
he said, "Don't
let them get it."

50:54.985 --> 50:56.787
I-I don't know who
he's working for,

50:58.055 --> 50:59.890
but he was so scared.

51:01.326 --> 51:04.962
It could be the government
or a secret organization

51:04.962 --> 51:05.830
or worse.

51:08.799 --> 51:11.636
- So what are we
supposed to do now then?

51:11.636 --> 51:16.141
- I don't know yet, but we're
gonna ask God for guidance.

51:16.141 --> 51:17.007
Follow me.

51:18.643 --> 51:19.710
- Oh, my God.

51:29.987 --> 51:32.590
- [Micha] The readings
appear to be promising,

51:32.590 --> 51:36.661
but there are so
many differences to
what we're expecting,

51:36.661 --> 51:38.496
it's just difficult
to be certain.

51:38.496 --> 51:41.666
- Guys, there's diary
entries on here.

51:41.666 --> 51:44.269
- Is there a USB? We can
plug it into the laptop.

51:44.269 --> 51:45.736
(crockery clattering)
- Yeah.

51:55.780 --> 51:57.848
- It's been 14 days

51:57.848 --> 52:00.351
and I can already tell
there are signs of life.

52:01.686 --> 52:03.588
The egg has nearly
doubled in weight

52:03.588 --> 52:05.290
and there's been
a steady increase

52:05.290 --> 52:07.091
in temperature
over the last week.

52:08.226 --> 52:10.195
The readings appear
to be promising,

52:10.195 --> 52:14.199
but there are so
many differences to
what we're expecting,

52:14.199 --> 52:16.033
it's just difficult
to be certain.

52:16.901 --> 52:19.970
The temperature reading's 23.5,

52:19.970 --> 52:23.073
which is five to
seven degrees warmer

52:23.073 --> 52:26.544
than the probe recorded
on the, on the surface.

52:27.812 --> 52:29.146
In the Lacerta constellation,

52:29.146 --> 52:31.316
the light comes from
a weak, blue sun

52:31.316 --> 52:33.384
and hence why in the lab,
I fitted this blue light

52:33.384 --> 52:35.753
with a dimmer to mimic
the same conditions,

52:35.753 --> 52:36.954
that he would've
been exposed to,

52:36.954 --> 52:39.624
had he have been hatched
on his home planet.

52:39.624 --> 52:40.558
- I'm sorry, what?

52:41.926 --> 52:43.461
- Ssh!

52:43.461 --> 52:46.264
- There's no telling what
his temperament might be,

52:47.465 --> 52:50.167
so I have taken the same
precautions that we did

52:50.167 --> 52:52.303
at the lab, back
at the compound.

52:53.571 --> 52:57.074
I guess this will be
a record of the events

52:57.074 --> 53:00.077
surrounding the
birth of Lacerta.

53:02.413 --> 53:04.649
I named him Lacerta
after his home,

53:06.083 --> 53:10.087
I think it's a fitting
name, like a warrior's name

53:11.689 --> 53:14.859
and I hope he learns to
love it as much as I do.

53:16.327 --> 53:19.430
From what we know, based
on evidence we found

53:19.430 --> 53:21.332
on the Canus Asteroid,

53:22.467 --> 53:24.769
the civilization
was highly advanced.

53:24.769 --> 53:26.537
We can only assume
that this creature

53:26.537 --> 53:27.938
was at the top of
the food chain,

53:27.938 --> 53:30.641
so similar to homo
sapiens here on Earth.

53:31.776 --> 53:33.544
But something must
have happened,

53:33.544 --> 53:38.316
some cataclysmic event
that destroyed their planet

53:40.351 --> 53:43.321
and eradicated the
entire species.

53:43.321 --> 53:46.824
(gentle orchestral music)

53:48.326 --> 53:53.331
We can only hypothesize as
to what that might have been,

53:54.732 --> 53:56.233
but maybe if we knew what
that was, it it could help us

53:56.233 --> 53:58.669
to prevent the same thing
from happening here.

54:00.338 --> 54:05.242
If what we found is true,
(phone beeping)

54:06.411 --> 54:07.412
the species was
highly intelligent

54:08.479 --> 54:11.649
and able to build constructs

54:11.649 --> 54:14.652
we have yet to
develop here on Earth.

54:14.652 --> 54:19.424
(Lacerta breathing heavily)
(leaves rustling)

54:19.424 --> 54:22.527
(soft intense music)

54:32.169 --> 54:35.005
And that's why I
brought you here.

54:36.441 --> 54:39.344
I don't want them using
you to make more weapons.

54:42.012 --> 54:44.715
"Peace cannot be kept by force,

54:45.950 --> 54:48.453
it can only be achieved
through understanding."

54:51.522 --> 54:52.857
Einstein said that.

54:56.761 --> 54:59.864
I-I don't know if anyone
will see these videos,

54:59.864 --> 55:03.368
but I hope they're found
by someone in authority,

55:04.268 --> 55:06.737
who can look after him

55:06.737 --> 55:10.875
in the event that
anything happens to me.

55:10.875 --> 55:13.043
The one thing that
we know for certain,

55:13.043 --> 55:16.213
unanimous agreement
among my colleagues and I

55:17.281 --> 55:19.784
is that we-
(soft tense music)

55:19.784 --> 55:21.118
- What happened?

55:22.152 --> 55:23.721
- I don't know.

55:23.721 --> 55:26.657
(keyboard tapping)

55:29.293 --> 55:30.561
He's here.

55:30.561 --> 55:31.896
- What, he figured out
how to cut the power?

55:31.896 --> 55:33.731
- M-Micha said he's
really intelligent

55:33.731 --> 55:35.566
and he, um, he
was learning fast,

55:35.566 --> 55:37.768
so he must have figured
out a way to escape.

55:39.837 --> 55:42.407
(Lacerta growling)

55:42.407 --> 55:45.075
(soft tense music)

55:45.075 --> 55:47.344
- All right, I want you
girls to go and hide

55:47.344 --> 55:48.613
in the sacristy.
- What, Dad, no,

55:48.613 --> 55:49.847
what are you gonna do?
(tense pulsing music)

55:49.847 --> 55:52.182
- I will not allow this
thing into my church,

55:52.182 --> 55:54.519
the house of the
One Almighty God.

55:54.519 --> 55:58.088
I don't care if it is
an alien or a demon,

55:58.088 --> 56:02.693
it is not one of God's
creations, it is an abomination.

56:02.693 --> 56:06.296
Go now, I will deal
with this thing.

56:06.296 --> 56:08.833
- You can't go, Dad, you
don't know what it can do.

56:10.267 --> 56:14.772
- I have God on my side and
he will show me the light.

56:17.442 --> 56:18.275
Go.

56:18.275 --> 56:21.446
(tense pulsing music)

56:41.131 --> 56:45.135
(tense pulsing music continues)

56:51.576 --> 56:53.410
(phone beeping)

56:53.410 --> 56:56.814
- What happens if he
can find a way in?

56:56.814 --> 56:58.883
- My dad will know what to do.

56:58.883 --> 57:01.552
- I don't think confidence
is gonna get him very far.

57:02.720 --> 57:05.389
- I think it'll be fine.

57:05.389 --> 57:08.325
(soft tense music)

57:08.325 --> 57:11.829
(Lacerta growling softly)

57:17.101 --> 57:22.106
(Lacerta clicking)
(door clicking)

57:25.342 --> 57:30.347
(soft tense music)
(Lacerta growling softly)

57:42.026 --> 57:43.861
- You're not welcome here.

57:46.363 --> 57:48.465
This is the house of the Lord.

57:48.465 --> 57:50.467
There's no place for your kind.

57:51.869 --> 57:54.038
Begone from here, demon,

57:55.205 --> 57:59.043
lest thee be subjected
to the power of Christ.

57:59.944 --> 58:02.813
(soft tense music)

58:03.714 --> 58:04.549
Father,

58:06.250 --> 58:09.920
give me the strength to
ward off this abomination.

58:10.921 --> 58:14.058
(melodic organ music)

58:14.058 --> 58:16.260
In the name of the Father

58:16.260 --> 58:18.963
and of the son and of the Holy,

58:21.131 --> 58:23.400
(blow thudding)
spirit!

58:23.400 --> 58:28.005
(Lacerta roaring)
(melodic organ music)

58:28.005 --> 58:30.741
- How did your dad
learn how to do that?

58:30.741 --> 58:34.979
- He used to be a boxer
before he found God.

58:34.979 --> 58:38.282
(melodic organ music)

58:38.282 --> 58:43.287
(blows thudding)
(Lacerta groaning)

58:54.098 --> 58:57.267
(melodic organ music)

58:58.769 --> 59:02.172
(Lacerta growling)

59:02.172 --> 59:05.342
(melodic organ music)

59:10.014 --> 59:13.283
(object clattering)

59:13.283 --> 59:16.153
(Lacerta clicking)

59:21.959 --> 59:22.960
(blow thudding)

59:22.960 --> 59:24.995
(Joel thudding to floor)

59:24.995 --> 59:27.131
(Lacerta growling)

59:27.131 --> 59:32.136
(blows thudding)
(melodic organ music)

59:33.303 --> 59:37.241
- (sobbing) I have
to go and help him.

59:37.241 --> 59:39.910
- You will not defeat me, beast!

59:42.747 --> 59:46.083
- (speaking Latin)
Depart this house of God!

59:46.083 --> 59:48.152
(Lacerta growling)
Yield!

59:48.152 --> 59:49.754
Yield!

59:49.754 --> 59:53.157
(Holy water sloshing)
(Lacerta growling)

59:53.157 --> 59:55.059
(soft orchestral music)

59:55.059 --> 59:58.562
(Norma gasping)

59:58.562 --> 59:59.764
Dad.

59:59.764 --> 01:00:01.832
(Joel groaning)

01:00:01.832 --> 01:00:02.667
Dad.

01:00:04.168 --> 01:00:06.036
- How did you do that?

01:00:06.036 --> 01:00:08.172
You said it was an
alien, not a demon.

01:00:09.039 --> 01:00:10.107
- Salt hurts it.

01:00:13.177 --> 01:00:16.013
- And you know I
oversalt my Holy water.

01:00:16.013 --> 01:00:17.581
(Norma laughing)

01:00:17.581 --> 01:00:18.615
I love you.

01:00:20.584 --> 01:00:24.922
You have become everything
that I wished I could be.

01:00:26.757 --> 01:00:27.591
Today...

01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:36.767
Today, you were more
than just my flock,

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:40.537
you were my trusted
sheepdog, always vigilant

01:00:44.809 --> 01:00:47.244
and now you must
become the shepherd.

01:00:49.213 --> 01:00:53.117
- No, no, I'm not ready to
lose you, I still need you.

01:00:53.117 --> 01:00:54.752
- No, no,

01:00:54.752 --> 01:00:56.286
I needed you.

01:00:58.122 --> 01:01:00.758
You taught me more
with your existence

01:01:01.959 --> 01:01:04.128
than the "Bible" ever
did through scripture.

01:01:06.063 --> 01:01:09.900
I'm proud to call you daughter.

01:01:12.236 --> 01:01:13.738
Blood of my blood.

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.742
Your beating heart goes on,

01:01:21.578 --> 01:01:23.848
while mine no longer beats.

01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:28.585
I love you.

01:01:31.155 --> 01:01:32.089
I love you.

01:01:33.791 --> 01:01:38.662
- No, no, no, no, Dad. (sobbing)

01:01:38.662 --> 01:01:39.663
No, no, Dad.

01:01:41.331 --> 01:01:44.835
(solemn orchestral music)

01:01:48.672 --> 01:01:50.440
(Norma gasping)

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.442
- It's just us.

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:55.112
(Norma sobbing)

01:02:04.488 --> 01:02:07.724
- I'm sorry for
everything I ever said,

01:02:08.793 --> 01:02:10.060
he was amazing.

01:02:12.863 --> 01:02:15.032
- He gave his life for us.

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:20.637
(Lacerta growling)

01:02:21.505 --> 01:02:22.807
- We have to go.
- No, no.

01:02:22.807 --> 01:02:25.209
- We have to go.
- I can't leave him.

01:02:25.209 --> 01:02:26.310
- We have to go.

01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:28.345
- [Lyra] We cannot stay here.

01:02:28.345 --> 01:02:30.314
- We have to.
- Come on, we need to go.

01:02:30.314 --> 01:02:31.148
Come on.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:38.856
(footsteps thudding)

01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:48.833
- Hey, did you just see it?

01:02:48.833 --> 01:02:49.834
- [Lyra] No.

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:57.241
- I love you guys.

01:02:58.442 --> 01:02:59.910
- We love you too.

01:03:02.179 --> 01:03:05.049
- Sorry I'm such
a dick sometimes.

01:03:05.049 --> 01:03:08.252
(all laughing)
- We forgive you.

01:03:08.252 --> 01:03:11.555
(Lacerta growling)

01:03:11.555 --> 01:03:14.959
(Ursa gasping fearfully)

01:03:17.461 --> 01:03:21.365
(intense music)
(Ursa screaming)

01:03:21.365 --> 01:03:24.268
(Lacerta clicking)

01:03:28.438 --> 01:03:32.977
(Lacerta roaring)
(blows thudding)

01:03:32.977 --> 01:03:35.913
(soft tense music)

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:06.276
(soft tense music continues)

01:04:21.025 --> 01:04:23.593
(Lyra sobbing)

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:27.364
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:29.699
It's okay.

01:04:30.767 --> 01:04:31.601
It's okay.

01:04:32.436 --> 01:04:33.270
It's okay.

01:04:34.939 --> 01:04:36.106
- It got Ursa.

01:04:37.774 --> 01:04:38.542
- I know.

01:04:41.778 --> 01:04:44.714
- There's none of us left.

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:48.618
- Look, if we don't get out
of here, we're gonna be next,

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:50.454
okay, we-we need to leave.

01:04:50.454 --> 01:04:53.023
- What are we gonna
tell their families?

01:04:58.395 --> 01:05:01.631
- I don't know, we
couldn't have saved them,

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:04.534
there's literally nothing
that we could have done.

01:05:04.534 --> 01:05:09.006
- The only reason they were
even here was 'cause of me,

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.076
they wouldn't, they
wouldn't have died,

01:05:12.076 --> 01:05:13.177
if I hadn't been here.

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:15.479
- No, no.

01:05:15.479 --> 01:05:17.747
- [Lyra] If we weren't
celebrating my birthday.

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:19.816
- Don't say that, this
is not your fault.

01:05:22.086 --> 01:05:23.920
- I think it kind of is though.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.256
- Don't think like that,
okay, what's done is done.

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:29.026
We just, we need to
leave now, okay, okay?

01:05:29.026 --> 01:05:31.728
- I don't think I can, I
don't, I don't know what to do,

01:05:31.728 --> 01:05:33.430
we don't know where
it is, we don't know.

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.332
- It's okay, look,
we've got this far.

01:05:36.733 --> 01:05:41.605
We can do this, we just
need to get out of here now.

01:05:42.739 --> 01:05:44.008
My dad's car is around
the corner, okay,

01:05:44.008 --> 01:05:45.509
he-he always leave
the keys in there.

01:05:45.509 --> 01:05:49.946
Let's just make a run for it,
just get out of here, okay?

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:52.049
(Lacerta growling)
(soft tense music)

01:05:52.049 --> 01:05:55.119
Shit, come on, come on, come on.

01:05:55.119 --> 01:05:58.555
(tense orchestral music)

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:06.296
I think we're almost there.

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:07.864
(Lacerta growling)

01:06:07.864 --> 01:06:11.368
Come on, come on,
come on, let's go!

01:06:11.368 --> 01:06:15.539
(tense orchestral music)

01:06:15.539 --> 01:06:16.540
There it is.

01:06:20.544 --> 01:06:24.314
(car doors clicking)

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:26.383
(car doors thudding)

01:06:26.383 --> 01:06:31.388
(both breathing heavily)
(soft tense music)

01:06:34.891 --> 01:06:38.395
(car ignition stuttering)

01:06:40.397 --> 01:06:43.767
(soft pulsing music)

01:06:43.767 --> 01:06:46.903
No, no, no, no, no. (sobbing)

01:06:46.903 --> 01:06:49.573
Why'd you have to buy
a second-hand car?

01:06:49.573 --> 01:06:51.508
(phone beeping)
(soft tense music)

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:54.311
- He's coming, lock the doors.

01:06:54.311 --> 01:06:56.913
(blow thudding)
Oh!

01:06:56.913 --> 01:07:01.818
(blow thudding)
(intense music)

01:07:04.088 --> 01:07:05.955
(both screaming)

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:10.960
(Lacerta roaring)
(intense music)

01:07:16.333 --> 01:07:18.868
- You killed my father.

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:21.471
You killed my father. (sobbing)

01:07:22.939 --> 01:07:25.842
(soft tense music)

01:07:27.277 --> 01:07:28.512
- Where did he go?

01:07:29.646 --> 01:07:30.947
- I don't know.

01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:33.283
Oh, shit.

01:07:33.283 --> 01:07:35.452
- How does he keep finding us?

01:07:35.452 --> 01:07:36.686
- I don't know.

01:07:43.293 --> 01:07:46.730
No, I've had enough of this.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:50.134
He can't just go around
killing everyone.

01:07:52.469 --> 01:07:53.637
(soft tense music)

01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:56.140
- What are you doing?

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:58.875
(Norma grunting)

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:02.512
Where are you going?

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:05.882
- I'm going to end this.

01:08:05.882 --> 01:08:08.652
(car door clicking)
- Wait.

01:08:08.652 --> 01:08:10.720
(car door thudding)

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:11.555
Wait.

01:08:12.389 --> 01:08:15.725
(soft orchestral music)

01:08:26.503 --> 01:08:27.837
- Where are you?

01:08:29.273 --> 01:08:32.609
(soft orchestral music)

01:08:50.194 --> 01:08:51.361
Where are you?

01:08:52.396 --> 01:08:55.732
(soft orchestral music)

01:09:12.882 --> 01:09:15.219
(eerie tense music)

01:09:15.219 --> 01:09:17.987
(blow thudding)

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:19.256
- [Lyra] Norma!

01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:25.795
(blows thudding)
(intense music)

01:09:34.404 --> 01:09:36.940
- Get away from her, you bitch!

01:09:38.007 --> 01:09:39.343
Come and get me!

01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:45.815
(blows thudding)
(intense music)

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:49.085
Lyra, I'm coming to save you!

01:09:49.085 --> 01:09:52.256
(eerie intense music)

01:10:18.982 --> 01:10:20.484
- What's going on?

01:10:22.386 --> 01:10:23.653
- I don't know!

01:10:25.021 --> 01:10:29.793
(eerie intense music)
(spaceship rumbling loudly)

01:10:43.807 --> 01:10:45.642
What on Earth is that?

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:53.216
(eerie intense music)
(spaceship rumbling loudly)

01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:57.487
(Lacerta growling)

01:10:57.487 --> 01:11:02.392
(eerie intense music)
(spaceship rumbling loudly)

01:11:23.747 --> 01:11:26.450
(blow thudding)
(Lyra screaming)

01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:29.619
(eerie intense music)

01:11:30.587 --> 01:11:33.357
(static hissing)

01:11:33.357 --> 01:11:36.360
- The one thing that
we know for certain,

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:39.696
unanimous agreement among
my colleagues and I,

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:45.402
is that we are not
alone in this universe

01:11:47.537 --> 01:11:50.540
and there are probably
more of them out there.

01:11:52.409 --> 01:11:55.812
(tense orchestral music)

01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:25.842
(tense orchestral
music continues)

01:12:52.101 --> 01:12:56.305
(tense orchestral
music continues)
