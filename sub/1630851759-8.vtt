WEBVTT

00:03.873 --> 00:04.917
There's our girl.

00:04.961 --> 00:06.876
Just four days until
your bat mitzvah.

00:07.442 --> 00:09.357
When, according
to Jewish tradition,

00:09.400 --> 00:11.402
that girl
becomes a woman.

00:11.446 --> 00:13.056
And this woman's
gonna have

00:13.100 --> 00:16.277
the baddest party in
the history of bat mitzvahs!

00:16.320 --> 00:19.236
And the good thing is
no pressure on mom.

00:20.324 --> 00:21.934
I'm gonna go lie down.

00:21.978 --> 00:23.980
-Love you, Mom.
-Love you more.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.592
Wait until you see
my bat mitzvah, Mr. R.

00:27.636 --> 00:29.246
It's a '50s-themed party,

00:29.290 --> 00:32.119
based on the TV musical <i>
Doo Wop Days!</i>

00:32.162 --> 00:34.556
I remember!
The one with Ricky Angelo.

00:34.599 --> 00:35.818
♪ Concrete rain--

00:35.861 --> 00:37.037
Dad, please don't sing.

00:37.863 --> 00:39.343
Fine.
I'll save it for the party.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.998
-Dad...
-Fine, I'll save it
for the shower.

00:42.999 --> 00:45.523
Seriously?
Not even when I'm alone?

00:46.133 --> 00:48.961
It's gonna be a real
1950s sock hop.

00:49.005 --> 00:52.008
The food will be displayed
on spinning vinyl records!

00:52.052 --> 00:55.011
And there's gonna be
an amazing photo wall

00:55.055 --> 00:57.274
with the real backseat
from a '54 convertible.

00:57.666 --> 01:00.669
And a '50s car hop
to serve the tunes!

01:01.800 --> 01:04.020
To translate, Grandma
is gonna be Olive's DJ.

01:05.326 --> 01:07.110
So, what do you think,
Bat Mitzvah Girl?

01:07.154 --> 01:09.808
I think we have
a new mayor of Coolsville.

01:09.852 --> 01:12.028
Thank you!
Well, if you'll excuse me,

01:12.072 --> 01:13.682
I've gotta go burn rubber.

01:14.422 --> 01:15.945
Outta my way, square.

01:19.557 --> 01:20.819
Hey, guys, what's up?

01:20.863 --> 01:22.821
You know how I hate
to give bad news?

01:22.865 --> 01:24.040
Yeah?

01:24.084 --> 01:26.434
That's why I'm gonna
let Sophia give it.

01:26.477 --> 01:27.696
Emmy!

01:29.219 --> 01:31.700
Well, it appears Laura Silver

01:31.743 --> 01:33.267
had her bat mitzvah
on Saturday,

01:33.310 --> 01:35.965
and it seems that
she might've,

01:36.008 --> 01:38.489
kind of had the exact
same theme as yours.

01:38.837 --> 01:41.362
-What?
-No way it's exactly the same.

01:41.405 --> 01:42.928
She just posted
the pictures.

01:45.714 --> 01:48.847
There's a buffet with
spinning vinyl records!

01:48.891 --> 01:51.372
Big deal.
So, one thing's the same.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.374
And a photo wall
with a real backseat

01:53.417 --> 01:54.940
from a '54 convertible.

01:55.506 --> 01:57.334
Okay, two things.

01:57.378 --> 01:59.815
-And it's literally
called "Doo Wop Days"!
-Yeah, that's not good.

01:59.858 --> 02:01.643

02:35.329 --> 02:38.158
I can't have the exact
same party theme as Laura!

02:38.201 --> 02:39.985
Olive, we'll figure out
the party.

02:40.029 --> 02:42.597
But remember, there's
also a wonderful ceremony

02:42.640 --> 02:44.860
that is going
to be as beautiful

02:44.903 --> 02:46.862
and unique as you.

02:46.905 --> 02:49.038
Mom, if you're
not gonna help...

02:50.039 --> 02:52.041
She's all yours, girls.

02:53.347 --> 02:54.913
What am I gonna do?

02:55.653 --> 02:58.395
Don't worry.
We'll help you come
up with a new theme.

02:58.439 --> 02:59.918
How about
a music festival?

02:59.962 --> 03:01.920
Ali Cohen already did it.

03:01.964 --> 03:03.879
"Cohen-chella."

03:03.922 --> 03:05.446
You could do
a farm theme!

03:05.489 --> 03:07.361
That was the Zimmerman
bar mitzvah.

03:07.404 --> 03:10.712
Right. We all had to sing
"E-I-E-I-Owen."

03:11.582 --> 03:14.237
This is
literally a nightmare.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.372
I've got it. Olive,

03:18.415 --> 03:20.809
what do you love more
than anything in the world?

03:20.852 --> 03:22.289
You mean other than llamas?

03:23.551 --> 03:26.249
Oh! Llamas!

03:26.293 --> 03:27.772
I love llamas!

03:27.816 --> 03:30.645
I can do a llama-themed
bat mitzvah party!

03:30.688 --> 03:33.213
You can call it
"A Night in Peru."

03:33.256 --> 03:35.171
Syd, you're a genius!

03:35.215 --> 03:38.609
But, how am I gonna put together
a whole new party in four days?

03:38.653 --> 03:40.785
Don't worry. We'll all help.

03:40.829 --> 03:43.135
-Absolutely.
-We're here for you.

03:43.179 --> 03:45.660
Aw, you guys are the best.

03:45.703 --> 03:46.965
Mom!

03:49.141 --> 03:52.623
-What is it?
-I have a new
theme for my party!

03:52.667 --> 03:55.887
Llamas! It's called
"A Night in Peru."

03:56.279 --> 03:57.802
Okay...

03:57.846 --> 04:00.022
Processing,
processing, um...

04:00.065 --> 04:02.981
Well, we'll need to completely
change the centerpieces.

04:03.025 --> 04:05.375
The florist already hates us,
so that shouldn't be a problem.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.291
Emmy and I can go
to that party store

04:08.335 --> 04:09.901
and see if they have
any llama balloons.

04:09.945 --> 04:12.904
-Great! And Syd,
you come with me and my mom.
Oh.

04:12.948 --> 04:14.776
Olive, you have an appointment
with the rabbi today

04:14.819 --> 04:16.299
to go over your
speech, remember?

04:16.343 --> 04:18.780
Right, right. Um, Syd,

04:18.823 --> 04:20.172
why don't you meet me
at the temple,

04:20.216 --> 04:21.826
and then we'll
hit the bakery

04:21.870 --> 04:24.525
since we have to completely
redesign the cake.

04:24.568 --> 04:27.005
How am I ever gonna
do this in four days?

04:27.049 --> 04:29.269
Olive, save the drama
for your llama.

04:30.008 --> 04:31.619
Hey, is that too
long for a hashtag?

04:36.276 --> 04:37.886
You know, Leo?
Picking this boom box

04:37.929 --> 04:40.018
as the grand prize was
the smartest thing you've done

04:40.062 --> 04:41.498
since hiring me.

04:41.542 --> 04:44.371
The only difference is this
boom box actually works.

04:46.024 --> 04:47.939
So, have you finally
decided what we're gonna do

04:47.983 --> 04:49.289
for your birthday on Saturday?

04:49.332 --> 04:51.813
I can't decide.
Thirteen's a big one.

04:51.856 --> 04:54.511
I'm on my way to manhood.
By next week,

04:54.555 --> 04:56.818
I could have a full beard!

05:00.952 --> 05:03.912
MC Gavel!

05:03.955 --> 05:07.132

What better way to celebrate
than to meet MC Gavel

05:25.977 --> 05:27.370
and make him my best friend?

05:27.718 --> 05:29.807
And who knows more
about MC Gavel than us?

05:29.851 --> 05:31.461
We are so gonna win this.

05:34.029 --> 05:36.074
Max, what time is it?

06:04.712 --> 06:07.628
I'm Sydney, Olive's BFF.
She's running a little late.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.847
Oh. Well, Sydney,

06:09.891 --> 06:11.936
why don't you come into
my office while we wait?

06:11.980 --> 06:12.937
Okay.

06:18.116 --> 06:21.555
Wow. Rabbi Feller,
your office is dope!

06:22.033 --> 06:24.819
Oh no. Am I allowed to
say "dope" to a rabbi?

06:25.646 --> 06:27.996
You are when her
office is this sick!

06:29.650 --> 06:32.957
So, tell me about you and Olive.
How long have you been friends?

06:33.262 --> 06:35.220
We met in second grade.

06:35.264 --> 06:37.962
I twisted my ankle playing tag,
and she ran over to help.

06:38.006 --> 06:40.574
What 8-year-old carries
around a fold-up crutch?

06:43.881 --> 06:46.841
Still can't believe Olive's
about to become a woman.

06:46.884 --> 06:48.886
It's a big day.

06:49.887 --> 06:51.367
Do you know what it
means to become a woman

06:51.411 --> 06:52.542
in Jewish tradition?

06:53.413 --> 06:55.806
Oh. Well, it means, uh...

06:56.981 --> 06:58.853
Why don't you go first?

06:59.984 --> 07:01.899
Well, when a girl turns 13,

07:01.943 --> 07:05.076
she is welcomed into
the community as an adult.

07:05.816 --> 07:08.993
And as an adult, she is now
accountable for her actions

07:09.037 --> 07:11.648
and responsible for making
the world a better place.

07:12.519 --> 07:13.476
That's awesome.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.478
Yes, it is.

07:15.957 --> 07:19.090
On the day of her bat mitzvah,
Olive will read from the Torah.

07:19.134 --> 07:21.876
Her portion is all
about finding gratitude

07:21.919 --> 07:24.966
in difficult times.
Then, she'll give a speech,

07:25.009 --> 07:27.969
explaining how its
relevant to her own life.

07:28.012 --> 07:30.624
Wow. That's powerful.

07:31.189 --> 07:32.974
Olive hasn't really
talked about the ceremony.

07:34.628 --> 07:36.673
I'm sure she'll be
here any minute.

07:36.717 --> 07:38.458
She had a party 911.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.024
I see.

07:41.286 --> 07:43.506
Unfortunately for some kids,

07:43.550 --> 07:46.509
the party becomes more
important than the ceremony.

07:47.031 --> 07:50.295
They miss out on getting
the true meaning of
their special day.

07:50.992 --> 07:52.733
Oh, that's not Olive.

07:52.776 --> 07:55.823
Her bat mitzvah
means a lot to her.

07:55.866 --> 07:57.825
A lot.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.003
Speaking of Olive...

08:04.353 --> 08:06.007
Hi. Where are you?

08:06.050 --> 08:07.922
<i>Syd, I'm having
a really tough time</i>

08:07.965 --> 08:10.228
<i>finding llama-themed
party stuff.</i>

08:10.272 --> 08:13.275
<i>No, Mom! An alpaca
does not count!</i>

08:14.668 --> 08:16.844
<i>Tell the rabbi I'm not
gonna be able to make it,</i>

08:16.887 --> 08:18.541
<i>and that I'm really sorry.</i>

08:18.585 --> 08:20.804
<i>And say "really,"
like, three times.</i>

08:20.848 --> 08:22.763
-But, Olive-- <i>
-Gotta go. Bye!</i>

08:28.072 --> 08:29.900
Syd, I'm so sorry
I didn't show

08:29.944 --> 08:31.946
at the temple yesterday.

08:31.989 --> 08:34.296
But guess what?
I found yarmulkes

08:34.339 --> 08:36.124
with little llamas on them.

08:36.167 --> 08:38.082
Llamakas!

08:38.126 --> 08:39.519
Cool.

08:39.562 --> 08:40.868
You know, speaking of cool,

08:40.911 --> 08:42.783
I got to hang out
with Rabbi Feller.

08:42.826 --> 08:44.698
She told me all about
the meaning of bat mitzvahs.

08:44.741 --> 08:47.135
Yeah, yeah. Lots of meaning.

08:47.918 --> 08:50.225
She also said some kids become
so obsessed with their party

08:50.268 --> 08:53.315
that they forget the ceremony
is the most important part.

08:53.794 --> 08:56.797
Okay, maybe I have been a little
distracted by the party,

08:56.840 --> 08:59.539
but I'll be ready. Don't worry.

08:59.582 --> 09:02.237
I can't help it. I love you,

09:02.280 --> 09:04.587
-so I worry.
-Wow.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.024
Throw on some sensible shoes
and offer me hard candy,

09:07.068 --> 09:08.809
and it's like you're my grandma.

09:10.027 --> 09:12.116
Trust me, Syd.
I've got it under control.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.727
Great.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.424
So, the rabbi told me
you're giving a speech.

09:15.467 --> 09:18.296
-I can't wait to hear it.
-I promise, you'll be the first.

09:18.340 --> 09:19.689
As soon as I write it.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.604
What? You haven't
written it yet?

09:21.648 --> 09:23.954
Easy, <i>Bubbie.
Remember your blood pressure.</i>

09:24.955 --> 09:27.871
Besides, I blocked off
the whole afternoon to write it.

09:28.393 --> 09:31.005
DJ Llama Mama in the house!

09:31.440 --> 09:32.876
Whoa, Grandma!

09:32.920 --> 09:34.922
Grandma J, just when
I think you're the best,

09:34.965 --> 09:36.837
you get even bester.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.534
Thanks, O. Plus,

09:38.578 --> 09:41.102

get the costume?

10:01.818 --> 10:03.951
At the party shop next
to Lacy's Earrings.

10:03.994 --> 10:05.779
They have an entire
llama section.

10:05.822 --> 10:07.128
Seriously?

10:07.171 --> 10:09.652
I need to go there with
my mom, like, right now.

10:09.696 --> 10:12.220
-Olive, what about your speech?
-I'll get to it. See you later!

10:12.960 --> 10:15.615
Well, I should get
out of this costume.
On the way here,

10:15.658 --> 10:18.574
an animal rescue van
started following me.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.012
Here you go, boys.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.884
To keep your minds
sharp for the contest,

10:23.927 --> 10:25.755
I made you some brain food.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.976
Are you crazy?
I'm not eating brains!

10:29.759 --> 10:30.891
It's not brains.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.719
It's a peanut butter sandwich

10:32.762 --> 10:35.373
because nuts help
stimulate the brain.

10:35.417 --> 10:36.853
You might wanna
take the bigger half.

10:38.986 --> 10:41.466
Hey, it's almost contest time.
Turn it on! Turn it on!

10:42.511 --> 10:44.861
<i>Okay, listeners.
If you're our 10th caller</i>

10:44.905 --> 10:47.821
<i>and answer the MC Gavel
trivia question correct,</i>

10:47.864 --> 10:49.649
<i>you and a friend</i>

10:49.692 --> 10:52.913
<i>will get to meet MC
on the set of
his latest music video.</i>

10:52.956 --> 10:55.480
<i>The trivia question is...</i>

10:55.524 --> 10:58.788
<i>what is MC Gavel's real name?</i>

10:58.832 --> 11:00.834
Bernard Tyrell Williams!

11:03.750 --> 11:04.838
Oh no. It's busy.

11:05.882 --> 11:08.015
Leo, keep dialing.
I'll get my mom's cell phone

11:08.058 --> 11:09.799
so we can double our
chances of getting through.

11:20.070 --> 11:21.942
<i>Hello, caller number 10!</i>

11:21.985 --> 11:24.161
He-wo?!

11:24.205 --> 11:26.860
<i>Okay! For a once-
in-a-lifetime chance</i>

11:26.903 --> 11:28.209
<i>to meet MC Gavel,</i>

11:28.252 --> 11:30.777
<i>what is MC's real name?</i>

11:31.386 --> 11:33.910
Bernah Tywe Willims!

11:35.390 --> 11:36.826
<i>Excuse me?</i>

11:38.001 --> 11:40.743
Bernah Ty--

11:40.787 --> 11:43.790
<i>-I'm sorry,
I can't understand you.
-'Cause it's peanuh bubba!</i>

11:44.878 --> 11:46.444
<i>And time's up.</i>

11:46.488 --> 11:48.490
<i>Looks like we're gonna have
to go to the next caller.</i>

11:56.411 --> 11:59.719
Whoa, Olive. There are more
llamas in here than in Peru.

12:01.155 --> 12:03.984
Grandma J's place
was a gold mine!

12:04.462 --> 12:07.552
They even had
llama-shaped glow sticks!
Try one on.

12:07.596 --> 12:09.772
Thanks, but I'm still
a little wet from the rain,

12:09.816 --> 12:11.165
and having something
electric on my head

12:11.208 --> 12:12.862
doesn't seem
like a good idea.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.517
Oh, it's still raining?

12:15.560 --> 12:18.476
Maybe it's time to activate
my color-coded multi-phase

12:18.520 --> 12:19.956
party backup plan.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.393
-What is it?
-Move stuff inside.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.875
Look at you all organized.

12:25.919 --> 12:28.922
I bet you have everything
ready for your bat mitzvah.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.880
Everything.

12:30.924 --> 12:32.490
Syd, are you trying to tell me

12:32.534 --> 12:34.101
I should be working
on my speech?

12:34.536 --> 12:35.842
What? No.

12:35.885 --> 12:37.887
Suggest, maybe.
Tell, never.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.977
You are literally turning
into my Grandma Molly.

12:42.152 --> 12:44.285
Well, you'll be happy to know,

12:44.328 --> 12:45.939
I already wrote it.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.984
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

12:48.028 --> 12:51.422
You know how my Torah portion is
about gratitude in hard times?

12:51.466 --> 12:54.469
Well, I wrote about how when
Laura stole my party theme,

12:54.512 --> 12:57.080
it was the hardest thing
I've ever had to endure.

12:57.559 --> 12:59.822
And how I'm really
grateful because now,

12:59.866 --> 13:01.955
I'm gonna have
an even better party!

13:04.305 --> 13:06.220
-Wow.
-I know.

13:06.263 --> 13:08.265
Pretty deep, huh?

13:09.179 --> 13:10.920
Olive, I'm not sure
changing your party theme

13:10.964 --> 13:12.879
would be considered
hard times.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.924
That's because you
haven't gone through it.

13:15.969 --> 13:18.928
I just hope you never have
to feel that kind of pain.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.934
There he is!
The almost birthday boy!

13:24.978 --> 13:26.980
So, how are we gonna
celebrate tomorrow?

13:27.023 --> 13:28.982
We're not.
After blowing that contest,

13:29.025 --> 13:30.461
I don't deserve a birthday.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.290
If it wasn't for my good looks
and dazzling smile,

13:33.334 --> 13:35.815
I couldn't look
myself in the mirror.

13:36.772 --> 13:39.775
Leo, it was an accident.
You have to celebrate.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.430
How about you and I
go to the movies,
then out for pizza?

13:42.473 --> 13:44.127
-Will I be there?
-Of course.

13:44.171 --> 13:45.650
Then I don't wanna go.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.828
Max, nothing I do
will be as special

13:48.871 --> 13:50.525
as hanging out
with MC Gavel,

13:50.568 --> 13:51.918
so why even bother?

13:52.353 --> 13:54.703
Then you know what?
We're going down there tomorrow,

13:54.746 --> 13:56.183
and you're gonna meet MC Gavel.

13:56.226 --> 13:58.141
How? I didn't win the contest.

13:58.185 --> 14:00.230
We'll tell them it
wasn't your fault.

14:00.274 --> 14:01.536
It was the peanut butter's.

14:01.579 --> 14:03.843
That's the plan?
Blaming peanut butter?

14:04.974 --> 14:07.934
You know, it sounds even smarter
when I hear someone else say it.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.329
Max, this whole plan
seems a little desperate.

14:12.373 --> 14:13.853
Which we are, so I'm in!

14:18.335 --> 14:20.598
Okay, time for a break.
You guys have been

14:20.642 --> 14:22.296
stuffing llama goody bags
for two hours.

14:22.339 --> 14:25.299
I know because I used
this llama stopwatch.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.824
I can't thank you all enough for
helping with the party favors.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.695
With Olive's
bat mitzvah tomorrow

14:30.739 --> 14:32.436
and her dad not
back until tonight,

14:32.480 --> 14:34.395
I'm kinda overwhelmed.

14:34.438 --> 14:35.787
I guess her brother's
hockey tournament

14:35.831 --> 14:36.876
was sort of bad timing.

14:37.267 --> 14:39.269
Well, I was praying they
wouldn't make the finals,

14:39.313 --> 14:41.924
but, uh,
good for them.

14:42.490 --> 14:44.840
But we did it, Mom.
A Night in Peru

14:44.884 --> 14:46.929
is gonna be even better
than Doo Wop Days.

14:47.364 --> 14:50.106
-Wow, it's really coming down.
-Well, I'm ready for it.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.848
All rainy day backup plans
have been activated.

14:53.588 --> 14:56.243
-Bring it on, storm!

14:56.678 --> 15:00.116
Okay, maybe bring it
a little less.

15:02.597 --> 15:04.512
-Excuse me.
-Oh, I forgot the drinks.

15:04.555 --> 15:05.948
I'll give you a hand.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.082
Could Olive be
more excited?

15:09.125 --> 15:10.822
I know. I'm <i>kvelling.</i>

15:12.085 --> 15:14.043
Olive's grandma
says that when she's happy.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.567
Usually comes with
a cheek-pinch.

15:17.568 --> 15:18.961
Tomorrow is such
a big day for Olive.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.745
I cannot wait
to hear her speech.

15:21.485 --> 15:24.097
Yeah. Her speech.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.490
-Syd, what's going on?
-Well, according to the rabbi,

15:26.534 --> 15:29.145
it's one of the most important
parts of the ceremony.

15:29.189 --> 15:31.104
And I don't mean
to sound judgy,

15:31.147 --> 15:32.975
but I think she kinda
missed the meaning.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.934
Well, that's too bad.
Did you talk to her about it?

15:35.238 --> 15:37.588
Tried to, but it's
Olive's bat mitzvah,

15:37.632 --> 15:40.809
and however she chooses
to celebrate is up to her.

15:40.852 --> 15:43.768
So, I plan on just
being there for her
and having a great time.

15:43.812 --> 15:46.510
Me, too. So,

15:46.554 --> 15:49.731
at the party, how about
a dance with your old man?

15:49.774 --> 15:51.776
Let's make that
a definite maybe.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.912
-Mom, is everything okay?
-That was the rabbi.

15:57.869 --> 15:59.654
The roads are flooded
from the storm,

15:59.697 --> 16:01.786
and it's unsafe to go out, so...

16:03.092 --> 16:05.007
they're gonna have to
cancel the bat mitzvah.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.878
What?

16:06.922 --> 16:08.054
No. No way.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.969
Honey, I am so sorry.

16:21.502 --> 16:24.592
-How's Olive?
-Devastated.
And to make matters worse,

16:24.635 --> 16:26.594
her father and brothers
can't fly home.

16:26.637 --> 16:28.944
-The airports are all closed.
-Yeah, they've locked down
the entire city.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.034
Olive, I am so, so sorry.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.993
It's so not fair.

16:34.036 --> 16:36.343
No, it's not. It stinks.

16:36.386 --> 16:39.520
I feel like kicking,
screaming, breaking stuff.

16:39.563 --> 16:41.304
Max, give me
something of yours.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.872
Honey, we'll have
your bat mitzvah,

16:43.915 --> 16:46.570
and the most awesome
party. I promise.

16:46.614 --> 16:50.009
But when? These things get
booked years in advance.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.272
Well, sweetie, I don't know,
but we'll make it happen.

16:52.315 --> 16:55.318
-And I'll be there.
-And so will my grandchildren.

16:56.841 --> 16:58.582
Olive, I kinda
know how you feel.

16:58.626 --> 17:01.933
For my 18th birthday,
I planned an amazing party.

17:01.977 --> 17:05.937
But the morning of,
Portland had its biggest
snowfall in history.

17:05.981 --> 17:08.244
There was nothing we could do,
so it was canceled,

17:08.288 --> 17:09.550
and I was heartbroken.

17:09.593 --> 17:12.335
But you eventually
had it, right?

17:12.814 --> 17:14.642
Well, um, you know...

17:15.251 --> 17:16.731
Does anyone else
have a story?

17:18.863 --> 17:20.909
Who could top that
inspirational tale?

17:22.302 --> 17:23.999
Wait.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.828
Olive, who says you have
to cancel your bat mitzvah?

17:26.871 --> 17:28.743
What are you talking about?

17:28.786 --> 17:30.092
My dad's party was, like,

17:30.136 --> 17:32.094
1,000 years ago
in the Dark Ages.

17:34.009 --> 17:36.968
These days, you can
do anything online.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.318
Including a bat mitzvah.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.885
Syd, that's
a great idea!

17:40.929 --> 17:42.931
Olive, all we need
is you, the rabbi,

17:42.974 --> 17:44.280
and an internet
connection.

17:44.324 --> 17:45.716
Please tell me you
have good WiFi.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.632
I got the ultra package.
Makes me feel special.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.069
Is that sad?

17:50.982 --> 17:53.724
But what about my llama party?
A Night in Peru?

17:53.768 --> 17:55.900
You want a llama party,
and you're gonna get one.

17:55.944 --> 17:59.208
Totally! DJ Mama Llama
in the house!

17:59.252 --> 18:01.428
And I have all the party
stuff out in my car.

18:01.471 --> 18:03.952
I mean, I can make this
place bat mitzvah ready.

18:03.995 --> 18:06.868
All I need is a ladder,
a hot glue gun,

18:06.911 --> 18:09.131
and people willing
to be micromanaged.

18:09.871 --> 18:11.394
Mrs. Rozalski,
send me your guest list.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.440
I'll make sure everyone
who loves you is there.

18:15.485 --> 18:17.966
I can't believe you guys
would do all this for me.

18:18.009 --> 18:19.576
You bet we would.

18:19.620 --> 18:22.797
You can even wear
one of my party dresses.
Any one you want.

18:22.840 --> 18:25.365
Even the silver metallic
one you haven't worn yet?

18:26.279 --> 18:28.281
That one, huh?

18:29.325 --> 18:30.935
-Sure.
-Yes.

18:30.979 --> 18:33.199
-Okay, people,
let's get to work!

18:33.242 --> 18:35.679
Sorry about the clapping.
I didn't bring my whistle.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.292
Come on, Olive.
Let's go try on that dress.

18:39.335 --> 18:42.338
In a little while.
I've got something
I need to do.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.559
Deb, I'll go get
the stuff out of your car.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.521
-Whoa!

18:51.565 --> 18:53.567
Maybe I should tie a rope
around my waist first.

18:57.092 --> 18:59.790
-Let me do the talking.
-I let my pants do mine.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.969
Hello. May I present
Leo Webb,

19:05.013 --> 19:07.450
MC Gavel radio
contest winner.

19:07.494 --> 19:09.670
And I'm Max Reynolds,
his best friend.

19:09.713 --> 19:12.847
The contest winners
are already inside.
Nice try, fellas.

19:12.890 --> 19:15.589
No, no. You don't understand.

19:15.632 --> 19:16.807
We belong in there.

19:16.851 --> 19:19.723
Lemme guess.
You're MC's biggest fans,

19:19.767 --> 19:22.422
you have all of his albums,
it's your birthday.

19:22.465 --> 19:23.814
I've heard every
excuse in the book.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.990
Well, not this one.
You see,

19:26.034 --> 19:28.950
Leo was the 10th caller
and knew the answer.

19:28.993 --> 19:31.126
But, right before they
asked me the question,

19:31.170 --> 19:33.128
I ate a peanut
butter sandwich.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.740
So, when the DJ said,
"what's MC Gavel's real name?"

19:36.784 --> 19:39.439
-Leo said...

19:43.791 --> 19:46.272
You guys are right.
I haven't heard that one before.

19:46.315 --> 19:47.360
Lemme see what I can do.

19:48.883 --> 19:51.886
Did you hear that?
He's gonna see what he can do!

19:51.929 --> 19:53.844
Man, I haven't
been this nervous

19:53.888 --> 19:56.760
since the last time you said,
"I have an idea."

19:58.675 --> 20:01.461
-Alright, good news.
Yes!

20:01.504 --> 20:03.506
-They have room for one more.
-What?

20:04.551 --> 20:06.857
-One?
-Sorry, guys.
The best I could do.

20:08.642 --> 20:09.904
Well, Leo...

20:10.600 --> 20:11.862
Have a great time.

20:11.906 --> 20:13.821
Me? Why me?

20:13.864 --> 20:15.214
You wanted to meet MC, too.

20:15.910 --> 20:18.217
Yeah, I'd love to meet him,

20:18.260 --> 20:20.828
but it'd make me even
happier for you to.

20:22.177 --> 20:23.570
Happy birthday, man.

20:23.874 --> 20:26.442
Thanks, Max.
You're a great friend.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.793
Oh! You know what time it is?

20:29.837 --> 20:31.795
It's Gavel time!

20:36.626 --> 20:38.106
<i>Welcome, everyone.</i>

20:38.933 --> 20:41.370
<i>When Olive told me
she didn't want to postpone</i>

20:41.414 --> 20:44.460
<i>her bat mitzvah,
I was surprised,</i>

20:44.504 --> 20:46.854
<i>delighted, and proud.</i>

20:46.897 --> 20:49.596
<i>A lot of kids
would've given up,</i>

20:49.639 --> 20:51.075
<i>but she showed strength,</i>

20:51.119 --> 20:53.991
<i>determination, and courage.</i>

20:54.035 --> 20:55.950
Way to go, Olive!

20:55.993 --> 20:58.169
I'm sorry.
I just slipped out.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.956
<i>We are now going to
begin the Torah service.</i>

21:01.999 --> 21:04.393
<i>-Ready, Olive?
-Yes.</i>

21:06.308 --> 21:08.876
<i>Vayachalom...</i>

21:08.919 --> 21:12.227
<i>vehineh sulam...</i>

21:12.271 --> 21:15.186
<i>mutsav artsah...</i>

21:15.230 --> 21:17.058
<i>verosho...</i>

21:17.101 --> 21:20.322
<i>magiya hashamaymah...</i>

21:20.366 --> 21:22.803
<i>vehiney mal'achey...</i>

21:22.846 --> 21:24.805
<i>Elohim...</i>

21:24.848 --> 21:27.721
<i>olim veyordim...</i>

21:28.330 --> 21:32.029
<i>bo.</i>

21:32.378 --> 21:34.336
<i>Yasher koach.</i>

21:34.380 --> 21:35.946
<i>Beautifully done,
Olive.</i>

21:37.905 --> 21:39.820
<i>Olive is now going
to give a speech</i>

21:39.863 --> 21:42.126
<i>reflecting on her
Torah portion.</i>

21:43.084 --> 21:46.043
My Torah portion is
called <i>Vayeitzei.</i>

21:46.783 --> 21:49.960
The part that had special
meaning for me was about Leah.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.876
She had huge disappointments
in her life,

21:52.920 --> 21:56.315
but was still able to find
gratitude in the worst of times.

21:57.141 --> 21:59.143
When I first wrote my speech,

21:59.187 --> 22:02.103
I thought the worst of times was
having to change my party theme.

22:03.583 --> 22:05.367
That's because
I didn't understand

22:05.411 --> 22:07.108
the true meaning
of my bat mitzvah.

22:08.892 --> 22:11.939
When the storm came,
it looked like
I wouldn't have one at all.

22:12.809 --> 22:15.246
Then, the people
I love came together

22:15.290 --> 22:16.857
and worked so hard

22:16.900 --> 22:18.815
to make sure this
special day happened.

22:18.859 --> 22:21.078
And it taught me that
sometimes in life,

22:21.122 --> 22:22.993
things happen that are
out of our control.

22:23.603 --> 22:26.649
But with the love and support
of your friends and family,

22:26.693 --> 22:28.869
and Mr. R's premium
internet package,

22:30.914 --> 22:33.526
you can get through
the toughest of times.

22:34.004 --> 22:37.617
And much like Leah,
it fills me with
so much gratitude.

22:38.922 --> 22:41.142
A lot of people are having
a much tougher time than I am

22:41.185 --> 22:42.883
because of the storm.

22:42.926 --> 22:45.407
So, instead of
a bat mitzvah present,

22:45.451 --> 22:48.410
I'd like everyone to donate
to our local relief fund.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.978
And please don't tell me
what you were getting me.

22:51.021 --> 22:52.371
I'm not that strong.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.418
I'd like to thank
Rabbi Feller

22:56.462 --> 22:58.594
for her guidance
and wisdom.

22:58.638 --> 23:00.335
I'd also like to thank my mom,

23:00.988 --> 23:03.512
for putting up with me
these last few months.

23:03.556 --> 23:05.949
And years.
I love you, Mom.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.953
-And you, too, Dad!
Love you, pumpkin!

23:09.997 --> 23:11.738
And you, too, bros!

23:11.781 --> 23:15.002
<i>-You crushed it, Olive!
-Yeah! That didn't
stink at all!</i>

23:16.220 --> 23:18.919
And finally,

23:18.962 --> 23:20.747
I'd like to thank
my best friend, Sydney.

23:21.704 --> 23:23.967
None of this would've
been possible without you.

23:25.839 --> 23:28.319
<i>Congratulations, Olive.</i>

23:28.363 --> 23:30.147
<i>You are now
a bat mitzvah.</i>

23:30.191 --> 23:31.758
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

23:31.801 --> 23:33.760
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

23:39.940 --> 23:42.725
<i>And now, put your hands
together and give it up</i>

23:42.769 --> 23:44.771
<i>for the bat mitzvah girl,</i>

23:44.814 --> 23:46.163
<i>Olive Rozalski!</i>

23:52.126 --> 23:53.867
So, honey,
what do you think?

23:54.607 --> 23:56.304
It's lla-mazing!

23:59.220 --> 24:02.005
And, Olive, what would
a llama party be without...

24:03.659 --> 24:06.227
A llama. A real llama!

24:06.270 --> 24:07.924
<i>"Mazel tov,</i> Olive."

24:07.968 --> 24:09.796
And he knows Hebrew!

24:09.839 --> 24:11.711
Well, Olive, you wanted
a bat mitzvah

24:11.754 --> 24:13.539
no one would ever forget,
and you got one.

24:13.582 --> 24:14.975
I sure did.

24:15.018 --> 24:16.759
What are we all
standing around for?

24:16.803 --> 24:18.369
