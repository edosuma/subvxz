Oh, Deej. Wanna come to yoga with me
at the rec center?

01:05.023 --> 01:07.109
The rec center?
Thought they only used that place

01:07.192 --> 01:10.153
for birthday parties
for people turning 100.

01:11.446 --> 01:15.200
If I make it to 100, my party better be
somewhere with an open bar.

01:16.702 --> 01:19.955
If you turn 100, I'm gonna
tell people I'm your younger sister.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.626
The baby... it's coming.

01:27.379 --> 01:29.840
[stammers] My baby? This baby?

01:29.923 --> 01:31.800
But we're going to yoga.

01:33.343 --> 01:35.554
Yeah. Your due date's
not for a month and a half.

01:35.637 --> 01:38.181
Tell that to my cervix.
It doesn't have a calendar.

01:40.267 --> 01:43.437
Oh, boy. Or... girl. Oh.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.771
Ooh, I got to call Jimmy.

01:44.855 --> 01:47.274
Okay. We just, we have to get
to the hospital, so...

01:47.357 --> 01:49.276
-Okay.
-Let's go get in the...

01:49.359 --> 01:53.071
the thing... th-th-that drives.
The thing, the thing.

01:53.155 --> 01:55.490
The wheels, the wheels.
What's it called?

01:55.574 --> 01:56.658
-Car.
-The car.

01:56.742 --> 02:00.412
Okay. We're going--
Wait. Where's the go-bag?

02:00.495 --> 02:03.957
Oh, Jimmy hasn't packed them yet.
And he's not answering the phone.

02:04.041 --> 02:06.126
Stop yelling in front of the...

02:06.209 --> 02:09.338
the thing inside me. What is it called?

02:09.421 --> 02:11.465
-The baby.
-The baby!

02:11.548 --> 02:14.259
Okay, we're gonna call Jimmy
from the car.

02:14.343 --> 02:15.844
-Let's go.
-Okay. Go!

02:15.927 --> 02:19.264
I'm holding it in.
I will not have another car baby.

02:26.521 --> 02:27.981
Well, that was embarrassing.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.903
Who knew indigestion
could feel just like childbirth?

02:34.446 --> 02:36.948
Two thousand bucks
so Kimmy could fart on a nurse.

02:40.118 --> 02:43.163
Steph, I still can't believe
that we never got hold of Jimmy.

02:43.246 --> 02:46.500
-What if this had been the real thing?
-But it wasn't.

02:46.958 --> 02:50.462
I mean, look, am I disappointed
he wasn't there? Yes.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.964
Do I wish he would step up a little more?

02:53.048 --> 02:55.133
-Yes.
-So are you gonna tell him?

02:55.717 --> 02:56.551
No.

02:58.845 --> 03:02.933
It's not how our relationship works.
Jimmy does his thing, and I do mine.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.186
Jimmy's different than the other Gibblers.
He's a little weird.

03:09.022 --> 03:12.067
I'm sure he had a good reason
for not answering his phone.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.278
Holy cow, babe, don't move.
There's a Pokémon right behind you.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.866
See? Good reason.

03:21.368 --> 03:24.538
-Why didn't you answer your phone?
-I was in game mode.

03:24.621 --> 03:27.624
Oh, I got five voicemails from you.
I should listen to those.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.795
-Sweet cheese, we're having a baby.
-No, give it to me.

03:32.796 --> 03:36.591
Honey, it was a false alarm,
but next time, it won't be,

03:36.675 --> 03:39.428
so if I call you,
just please answer your phone.

03:39.511 --> 03:40.887
-Okay.
-Okay.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.598
Is that it?

03:44.808 --> 03:48.437
Yes, it is. If you don't mind me
having my own relationship.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.319
You and I need to chat.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.365
Uh-oh, Jimmy. That's never good.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.453
Go ahead, Deej. This is gonna be good.

04:06.329 --> 04:09.791
What's on your mind, Deej?
I'm all ears and a good chunk of biceps.

04:12.252 --> 04:16.339
Stephanie is never gonna say this to you,
so as her big sister, I am.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.258
And as your big sister...

04:19.509 --> 04:22.637
I will listen because I have no idea
what she's gonna say next.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.142
Jimmy, I am really worried about you.

04:27.684 --> 04:30.520
There's a baby on the way
and you don't seem very ready.

04:31.146 --> 04:35.358
You never packed Stephanie's go-bag.
The crib is still in the box.

04:35.442 --> 04:39.154
-You have to be more responsible.
-I'm very responsible.

04:39.237 --> 04:42.491
I just got a photo gig in Nepal,
which is not pronounced "nipple."

04:45.202 --> 04:46.745
Learned that one the hard way.

04:48.747 --> 04:50.582
This is what I'm talking about.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.918
You're gonna leave
when the baby is on its way?

04:53.418 --> 04:56.379
From what I'm hearing,
it sounds like you want me to say no.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.842
Ooh, ooh, I got it.

05:02.010 --> 05:06.181
What if Jimmy stays with Stephanie,
and I go to Nipple to have the baby?

05:09.434 --> 05:11.686
And he's a little weird? Oh, I give up.

05:13.897 --> 05:16.733
-The Nipplese are very good breastfeeders.
-I know...

05:20.695 --> 05:23.156
Here is your tea, Mrs. Gibbler.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.534
Wow. Why, thank you, Casey.

05:25.617 --> 05:28.578
I'm so excited to have
my first high-school intern.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.248
Well, it was either this
or taking wood shop.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.458
And this scarf does not go with a bandsaw.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.087
[ringtone]

05:37.170 --> 05:40.173
Oop. Hold on, boss. I got this.

05:40.257 --> 05:43.134
Gibbler Style Party Planning.
How may I direct your call?

05:43.218 --> 05:45.679
Oh, yes. Let me see
if I can grab Mrs. Gibbler.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.809
Ah, I'm so sorry.
It looks like she's actually unavail.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.438
I'll have her return.
Okay, bye now. Light and love.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.734
Wow, that was impressive.

05:59.818 --> 06:02.320
Stephanie just hands me the phone
and says, "Talk."

06:03.947 --> 06:07.242
See, the less avail you are,
the more they want you.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.536
l learned that
on <i>Million Dollar Listings New York.</i>

06:09.619 --> 06:11.621
Bravo, <i>Bravo.</i>

06:14.082 --> 06:15.667
You are such a hoot.

06:15.750 --> 06:19.129
Oh. And you have the elegance
of a flamingo.

06:22.507 --> 06:25.260
Casey... I'm spoken for.

06:27.304 --> 06:30.098
But go on. Name another bird.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.853
So, for the Lopez <i>quinceañera,</i>
I booked the DJ,

06:34.936 --> 06:36.146
rented the silverware,

06:36.229 --> 06:38.899
and I booked <i>you</i>
an appointment at the extensions bar.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.985
Some lift in the back
will really bring out those cheekbones.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.947
Why did I never have an intern before?

06:46.031 --> 06:48.992
You do all this work.
You throw compliments at me.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.076
And I don't pay you?

06:52.120 --> 06:54.122
Listen, your smiles are payment enough.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.917
Well, then here's a bonus.

06:59.461 --> 07:01.087
Don't spend it all in one place.

07:04.132 --> 07:07.177
Who is this strapping young man
swanning about the kitchen?

07:07.260 --> 07:11.473
I am the only strapping young man
who's supposed to swan about the kitchen.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.977
Fernando, this is my new intern, Casey.

07:16.895 --> 07:20.440
Hmm. The same Casey
who just hung up on me

07:20.523 --> 07:22.901
and claimed you will return.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.155
One and the same.
Nice to meet you.

07:28.740 --> 07:32.202
I'm not gonna lie. He really built buzz
by saying you were unavail.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.038
Mm, thank you.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.122
[watch timer beeps]

07:36.206 --> 07:39.751
Uh, speaking of unavail,
I'm gonna miss my Broadway spin class.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.795
Tonight is <i>Bike of Mormon.</i>

07:43.046 --> 07:45.256
-Later potater.
<i>-</i>Bye.

07:46.257 --> 07:47.842
-Wow.
-[door closes]

07:47.926 --> 07:52.180
He's attractive, he's funny,
and he's incredibly well-groomed.

07:52.263 --> 07:55.809
-Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
-He's perfect for Ramona?

07:57.352 --> 07:59.396
I was gonna say you should fire him.

08:00.897 --> 08:04.317
He's adorable.
We have enough of that around here.

08:13.368 --> 08:16.287
-What the--?
-Cancel the ambulance, Gladys.

08:16.621 --> 08:17.789
They're alive.

08:19.791 --> 08:22.377
Happy birthday. You look 100 years young.

08:22.460 --> 08:26.339
It's my mom's birthday. I'm 60.

08:30.218 --> 08:33.388
We must have fallen asleep
at the meditation at the end of yoga.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.015
I feel completely refreshed.

08:35.098 --> 08:37.892
How can you be so relaxed
after what happened with Jimmy?

08:38.643 --> 08:40.812
It's fine.
It's not gonna happen again.

08:41.646 --> 08:44.774
Look, if you don't set expectations
before the baby arrives,

08:44.858 --> 08:46.192
it's only gonna get worse.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.654
It seems to be bothering you
a lot more than it's bothering me.

08:49.946 --> 08:53.199
I couldn't be more chill. Ow! Son of a--

08:53.283 --> 08:54.284
[blows whistle]

08:54.951 --> 08:57.370
Hey, you, Buttercup. Get off the court.

08:57.454 --> 08:58.913
Which one of us is Buttercup?

08:59.122 --> 09:01.374
Lady, I don't care.
You can be Buttercup, too.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.043
Just get off my court.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.336
Oh, yes, I was Buttercup.

09:06.588 --> 09:09.549
Dude, we were in the middle of
a conversation.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.259
We're in the middle of dodgeball tryouts.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.845
Why don't you make like a yoga mat
and roll on home?

09:15.055 --> 09:16.765
-Excuse me?
-Steph.

09:16.848 --> 09:19.476
-Just listen to the guy. Let's go.
-No, no.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.936
Nobody gets away
with not calling me Buttercup.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.816
What are you laughing at, punk?
I could dodge circles around these girls.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.986
-All right, I want in.
-Stephanie, what are you doing?

09:30.070 --> 09:33.239
Okay, blondie. One of my players
transitioned to the men's team.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.158
-See what you got.
-Mm-hmm.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.994
Stephanie, that lady has an ankle monitor.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.497
And I saw that one smoking.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.625
Those ladies will kill you.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.795
Nah, it's a safe sport. Now sign here
in the event your demise,

09:47.003 --> 09:49.255
dismemberment, or decapitation.

09:58.515 --> 09:59.682
[groans]

09:59.766 --> 10:00.850
Yeah.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.105
[more groans]

10:06.022 --> 10:08.942
Quit your whining, Francis. Walk it off.

10:11.736 --> 10:15.782
You know, as a compassionate human being,
I'm unsettled,

10:15.865 --> 10:19.577
but as a dodgeball professional,
I'm loving what I'm seeing here.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.456
Who was that out there?

10:23.540 --> 10:25.959
I'll tell you who. My new star player.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.711
Take that, Mom.
I'm moving out of the basement.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.590
<i>♪ Doo-ya, doo-dow ♪</i>

10:33.049 --> 10:35.343
Ramona, we have great news for you.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.679
That almost always means
not great news.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.976
You know how you always say
that your love life is "in the pits"?

10:44.727 --> 10:45.895
I've never said that.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.565
I know I've heard it somewhere.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.111
It's true. You haven't
gone out with anyone

10:53.194 --> 10:55.655
since you allegedly dated
that Japanese pop star.

10:57.157 --> 10:57.991
Allegedly?

10:58.074 --> 11:00.994
You were with me at the concert.
You saw him pull me onstage.

11:01.077 --> 11:04.164
Tsk. I don't know what I saw.
It was Japan.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.293
That country is mostly robots.

11:10.879 --> 11:15.049
Ramona, the great news is
I've set you up with the perfect boy.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.637
That's my cue to eat dinner
somewhere else.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.726
I think she wants me to follow her.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.898
-Ramona, stop.
-Mom, you stop.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.399
You meddle in everything.

11:32.317 --> 11:33.526
I never won a medal.

11:36.487 --> 11:39.574
Though I did come in fourth
in the Olympic bobsled.

11:40.992 --> 11:41.826
Funny story.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.495
-I was a waitress in Lillehammer and--
-No, no.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.999
Med-dle. Like the time
you dressed as a rapper

11:48.082 --> 11:50.668
and came to my school
with a clock around your neck?

11:51.628 --> 11:55.340
I'm sure I had a really good reason,
homeslice. Ooh-ooh.

11:57.634 --> 12:00.720
Or the time you dressed as a rat king
and snuck into my Christmas pageant.

12:00.803 --> 12:01.971
Mm.

12:02.639 --> 12:06.100
The newspaper said it was a performance
that would haunt them forever.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.104
That was not a compliment.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.566
What about the time
I shot everyone in laser tag

12:13.650 --> 12:15.318
to stop you from kissing Popko?

12:16.027 --> 12:19.280
Now you're even meddling in me
telling you how much you meddle.

12:21.616 --> 12:24.577
This is different.
I found you the perfect guy.

12:24.661 --> 12:27.747
And you're gonna go on a date with him
and fall in love

12:27.830 --> 12:29.832
and get married and have two children--

12:29.916 --> 12:31.417
Kimberlina and Kimberlando.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.046
Not doing it.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.675
Too late.
I already confirmed for tomorrow.

12:39.717 --> 12:43.346
Fine. I'll meet him because
I don't want to leave the guy hanging.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.099
But will you promise
to stop interfering in my life?

12:46.557 --> 12:48.518
You know I can't make you that promise.

12:50.061 --> 12:52.355
Oh. I'm running out of places
to storm off to.

equal responsibility.
