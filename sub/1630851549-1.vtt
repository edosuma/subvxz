00:09.226 --> 00:11.141
BOY:
You kidding me? It's not close.

00:11.185 --> 00:13.926
Michael Jordan averaged
30 points per game.

00:13.970 --> 00:16.451
Okay, so LeBron
has more rebounds

00:16.494 --> 00:17.887
and assists and more games.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.758
MJ never left a game early.

00:19.802 --> 00:20.716
So what?

00:20.759 --> 00:22.631
[tires screech][horn honks]

00:22.674 --> 00:24.850
What the hell, man?!

00:26.722 --> 00:29.116
What the hell
are you doing, man?!

00:29.159 --> 00:30.552
Come on!What is he doing?

00:30.595 --> 00:33.729
You trying to
run me off the road? Huh?

00:33.772 --> 00:35.122
Oh, you think you own the road?!Stupid idiot.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.038
Is that a gun?

00:42.433 --> 00:43.782
What do we got?

00:43.826 --> 00:45.132
Multiple shots fired.

00:45.175 --> 00:47.525
One hit a kid in a stroller.
Michael Carter.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.484
He's five years old.Five years old.

00:49.527 --> 00:51.138
OFFICER:
EMS just got here.

00:51.181 --> 00:52.791
DANNY:
Let's split up.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.576
Excuse me, sir,
I'm Detective Reagan.

00:54.619 --> 00:57.100
Could you tell me
what happened?I don't know. My son is shot.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.319
Did you see who shot him?

00:58.362 --> 01:00.408
If I did, he'd be dead
right now.

01:02.410 --> 01:03.628
I'm going with my son.

01:03.672 --> 01:06.675
Okay, go ahead.Let's go. Move.

01:07.458 --> 01:08.720
Go on.

01:08.764 --> 01:10.766
Let's go.
Ready, and...

01:18.121 --> 01:19.775
Hey...

01:23.126 --> 01:24.693
What about you?

01:24.736 --> 01:27.435
And you-- did you see
who shot the little boy?

01:29.741 --> 01:30.829
Nobody saw a thing?

01:33.441 --> 01:34.659
Five-year-old kid shot

01:34.703 --> 01:36.008
in front of a courtyard
full of people.

01:36.052 --> 01:38.315
Nobody saw a damn thing.

01:40.317 --> 01:41.623
Pack of lights.

01:43.494 --> 01:44.582
It's, uh, $12.85.

01:44.626 --> 01:46.280
$12.85? Get out of here.

01:46.323 --> 01:47.977
I'm sorry.

01:48.020 --> 01:50.284
Give me the cigarettes,
you stupid bitch.

01:50.327 --> 01:52.112
Come back when you can pay.

01:52.155 --> 01:54.331
Hey!Hey, cut it out!

01:54.375 --> 01:55.419
I'll call the cops.

01:55.463 --> 01:57.378
Stop!
Get out of here!

01:57.421 --> 02:00.511
You stop. You stop!Get out of here.

02:01.338 --> 02:02.383
[yells]

02:02.426 --> 02:03.993
Stop!Stop!

02:04.036 --> 02:05.212

02:05.255 --> 02:08.389
Go ahead!Help! Help!

02:08.432 --> 02:10.304
I want my cigarettes
right now!

02:10.347 --> 02:11.783
Police, come quick!

02:11.827 --> 02:13.742
There's a man in there
and he's going crazy.

02:13.785 --> 02:16.832
Police! Police. Back away.Oh, hey.

02:18.225 --> 02:18.964
Hey!

02:19.008 --> 02:21.706
Hey. Hey!

02:23.534 --> 02:26.363
Up against the wall.
Up against the wall.

02:26.407 --> 02:27.712
Sir, you're under arrest.

02:27.756 --> 02:29.192
Help me!Stop fighting us!

02:29.236 --> 02:31.063
Get 'em off me!Put your hands behind your back!

02:31.107 --> 02:32.195
[overlapping shouting]

02:32.239 --> 02:34.197
Let him go.
Let him go!

02:34.241 --> 02:35.546
You're murderers!

02:35.590 --> 02:37.113
Let him go!Sir!

02:37.157 --> 02:38.810
Hey, you need
to take a step back right now.

02:38.854 --> 02:40.769
Take a step back right now!You need to let him go!

02:40.812 --> 02:43.511
Everybody!
Give us some space, everybody.

02:43.554 --> 02:45.904
[shouting, clamoring contiuning]Take a step back!

02:46.905 --> 02:48.472
[crowd exclaims]

02:48.516 --> 02:50.692
Hey! Get back.

02:50.735 --> 02:51.519
[woman screams][all clamoring]

02:51.562 --> 02:52.911
[all shouting]

02:52.955 --> 02:55.218
Up against the pole.JAMIE: Back up!

02:55.262 --> 02:56.611
Step aside.
Make some space.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.308
You got him?Yeah.

02:58.352 --> 03:00.702
Put your hands behind your
back and stop fighting.

03:00.745 --> 03:02.269
Holster your weapon.

03:03.139 --> 03:05.272
All right,
everybody stay calm.

03:11.539 --> 03:12.540
What's this?

03:12.583 --> 03:14.368
You told me
that you witnessed

03:14.411 --> 03:16.239
a homicide as a teenager,

03:16.283 --> 03:18.981
and that you always regretted
not coming forward.

03:19.024 --> 03:20.591
I told you that was
a lie that I used

03:20.635 --> 03:21.766
to get our witness
to come forward.

03:21.810 --> 03:24.726
But it really did happen.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.425
I found the case.

03:28.469 --> 03:30.122
The murder of Reggie Lewis.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.690
You were interviewed
as a witness.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.605
And no one was arrested for it.

03:34.649 --> 03:37.478
Because no one could positively
ID the shooter.

03:37.521 --> 03:40.089
Erin, I was 13,
and there was no evidence.

03:40.132 --> 03:42.047
There's no statute
of limitations on murder.

03:42.091 --> 03:44.963
We can still get this guy.

03:55.757 --> 03:59.064
[sighs]

03:59.108 --> 04:01.893
I'm also calling in
our department's chief surgeon

04:01.937 --> 04:03.243
to consult as well.

04:03.286 --> 04:06.028
Are there not
good doctors here?

04:06.071 --> 04:07.725
Oh, of course there are.

04:07.769 --> 04:10.815
Of course there are. It's...

04:12.034 --> 04:14.515
GARRETT:
Frank.

04:20.216 --> 04:22.436
He's just a boy.

04:22.479 --> 04:25.961
Eli's 15.

04:26.004 --> 04:28.790
He's a good boy.

04:28.833 --> 04:32.141
He never harmed anyone.

04:32.184 --> 04:35.013
He's just a boy
riding the bus.

04:37.842 --> 04:40.323
POWER:
Anyone with information.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.412
Anyone who was on the bridge

04:42.456 --> 04:44.936
or saw who fired
into that bus,

04:44.980 --> 04:47.591
killing David Hoffman
and seriously

04:47.635 --> 04:51.203
injuring Elijah Chesnick should
call in to the NYPD hotline.

04:51.247 --> 04:53.728
And I'm gonna jump
protocol here.

04:53.771 --> 04:56.296
The city is offering
a $10,000 reward

04:56.339 --> 04:58.254
for the tip
that leads to an arrest.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.734
[reporters clamoring]

04:59.777 --> 05:01.170
POWER:
Helen. Helen.

05:01.213 --> 05:02.954
Commissioner Reagan, do you have
any leads up to now?

05:02.998 --> 05:04.782
Not yet. We...

05:04.826 --> 05:06.218
CHASE:
Hate Crimes is investigating.

05:06.262 --> 05:07.742
MALE REPORTER:
Mr. Mayor, can you tell us,

05:07.785 --> 05:09.918
were the victims targeted
because they're Jewish?

05:09.961 --> 05:12.529
CHASE:It's too early to tell
that right now, Robert.

05:13.748 --> 05:16.054
But it is
a fair question, Robert.

05:16.098 --> 05:17.969
But it's too early
to call this one.

05:18.013 --> 05:20.320
And I'd remind everyone
that, statistically,

05:20.363 --> 05:22.278
we are still
the safest big city.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.367
A little boy was shot
up in Harlem this morning.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.456
An isolated incident.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.284
What are you doing
about it, Commissioner?

05:28.328 --> 05:31.113
Everything I can, Helen.

05:31.156 --> 05:35.944
At least everything I can with
my hands tied behind my back.

05:35.987 --> 05:36.814
Meaning?

05:36.858 --> 05:38.555
Meaning we're all frustrated.

05:38.599 --> 05:40.427
Because there are
too many felons

05:40.470 --> 05:42.167
with illegal weapons
on the street.

05:42.211 --> 05:45.040
I'm confident that the
individual responsible for this

05:45.083 --> 05:46.563
will be arrested
and charged.

05:46.607 --> 05:48.826
I appeal to the public
for any help.

05:48.870 --> 05:51.089
Any information
on this so we can

05:51.133 --> 05:53.048
bring this killer
to justice.

05:53.091 --> 05:55.746
We will keep you informed
as things progress.

05:55.790 --> 05:57.879
That's all the questions
for today.

05:57.922 --> 06:00.142
[reporters clamoring]

06:03.145 --> 06:06.235
â™ª

06:29.998 --> 06:31.695
And hands tied
behind your back?

06:31.739 --> 06:32.957
What the hell?

06:33.001 --> 06:34.045
What the hell?

06:34.089 --> 06:36.004
You took away Anti-Crime,

06:36.047 --> 06:40.051
you cut my numbers
in the field and in the budget.I had no choice

06:40.095 --> 06:42.489
with the city
council. I had to.

06:42.532 --> 06:44.273
You don't go to war
with the army you want.

06:44.316 --> 06:45.753
You go with the army you have.

06:45.796 --> 06:47.755
And we do, every day.

06:47.798 --> 06:49.496
So it's my fault
some crazy person

06:49.539 --> 06:51.454
fired into a busload
of teenagers?

06:51.498 --> 06:53.369
That a kid got shot
at a playground.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.501
That's on me?Mr. Mayor,

06:54.544 --> 06:56.503
there is a reason
crime is rising,

06:56.546 --> 06:59.593
and pretending it isn't
won't make it go away.

06:59.636 --> 07:01.682
What are you trying
to do here, Frank?

07:01.725 --> 07:03.466
We're just getting
back on our feet,

07:03.510 --> 07:04.946
and you want to
scare away tourists

07:04.989 --> 07:08.471
ranting about more crime,
more-more guns.

07:10.038 --> 07:13.389
Your job out there
was to answer questions.

07:14.172 --> 07:16.827
Not to supply reporters
with headlines.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.180
[sighs]

07:22.224 --> 07:24.444
What happened to you, Pete?

07:25.532 --> 07:27.577
You were
the law and order mayor.

07:27.621 --> 07:30.711
You were the guy
I used to have to hold back.

07:30.754 --> 07:33.627
You know what, Frank?

07:33.670 --> 07:36.847
I've got a city on its knees.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.502
My hands are tied
just the same as yours.

07:39.546 --> 07:42.723
Mr. Mayor, call out
what's happening.

07:42.766 --> 07:45.508
You and me, together.

07:45.552 --> 07:48.380
I need people
to feel safe in this city.

07:49.207 --> 07:51.079
No. You need people

07:51.122 --> 07:54.038
to be safe in this city.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.434
We should get you
to the hospital.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.219
You could have an injury.I'm fine.

08:01.263 --> 08:02.656
JAMIE: Okay, we're gonna

08:02.699 --> 08:04.353
take a complaint on this...MAN: No.

08:04.396 --> 08:05.659
Thank you.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.487
Mr. Tran, in order
for us to charge him,

08:07.530 --> 08:08.662
you've got to cooperate
with us. Docu...

08:08.705 --> 08:11.186
Then we have to testify,
go to court.

08:11.229 --> 08:13.014
Close the store?
We can't miss a day's work.

08:13.057 --> 08:14.668
And what's the point?

08:14.711 --> 08:16.408
He'll be released anyway. No.

08:16.452 --> 08:19.194
If you don't file a complaint
the charges may not stick.

08:19.237 --> 08:20.456
Yeah, don't you want justice?

08:20.500 --> 08:23.459
I want people to leave us alone.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.982
You okay?

08:34.339 --> 08:36.211
Hey.

08:36.254 --> 08:37.473
Hey.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.474
How you been?

08:38.518 --> 08:40.781
Good. Busy. How you been?

08:40.824 --> 08:42.609
Same.

08:42.652 --> 08:46.264
What, you just happened
to be in my neighborhood?

08:46.308 --> 08:47.962
Well, I'm working a case.

08:48.005 --> 08:49.964
A little boy was
shot in a stroller,

08:50.007 --> 08:53.141
and I've been canvassing
for hours, and, uh,

08:53.184 --> 08:55.839
apparently everyone within
a two-block radius

08:55.883 --> 08:58.233
had their back turned
when the boy was shot.

08:58.276 --> 08:59.974
Is he gonna make it?

09:00.017 --> 09:01.671
I don't know yet.

09:01.715 --> 09:04.065
You have something of his.

09:04.108 --> 09:05.370
I do.

09:05.414 --> 09:06.720
Can I see it?

09:11.551 --> 09:12.726
Look, I don't know why

09:12.769 --> 09:14.292
I picked it up and I
don't know why I'm here.

09:14.336 --> 09:16.643
I just...Hey, hey, hey,
I'm glad that you did.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.384
How are your boys?

09:19.428 --> 09:20.690
Good, good.

09:20.734 --> 09:24.694
My youngest just
went off to college.Ah.

09:24.738 --> 09:27.349
It's his father's.
The baby's father

09:27.392 --> 09:28.568
is the key to the case.

09:28.611 --> 09:31.048
He's the reason
for the shooting.

09:31.092 --> 09:33.398
His father seemed like
a really good man.

09:33.442 --> 09:36.401
I'm getting, uh, rage.

09:36.445 --> 09:38.926
And jealousy.

09:38.969 --> 09:40.623
That's all.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.669
That's all I have.Okay.

09:45.062 --> 09:48.152
You okay?

09:48.196 --> 09:50.154
You let all of your cases
get under your skin like this?

09:50.198 --> 09:52.417
Innocent little kid.

09:52.461 --> 09:54.115
It's kind of hard
not to, you know?

09:54.158 --> 09:55.595
I know.

09:55.638 --> 09:57.988
Anyway, thanks.Mm-hmm.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.730
The call you went on
this morning.

10:00.774 --> 10:02.427
The deli.Yeah, we got

10:02.471 --> 10:04.560
two under for criminal mischief,

10:04.604 --> 10:06.301
reckless endangerment
and assault.

10:06.344 --> 10:07.432
And the other for assault.

10:07.476 --> 10:08.782
Is that Gillette?Yeah.

10:08.825 --> 10:10.653
He assaulted me while
I was cuffing the suspect.

10:10.697 --> 10:11.741
Hit me from behind.

10:11.785 --> 10:12.916
Do you have
any physical injuries?

10:12.960 --> 10:14.048
No.

10:14.091 --> 10:15.092
If you don't have any
physical injury,

10:15.136 --> 10:16.137
then the charge is harassment.

10:16.180 --> 10:18.269
But hitting a police officer

10:18.313 --> 10:19.444
is not harassment.

10:19.488 --> 10:21.272
I'm not addressing you,
Officer Janko.

10:21.316 --> 10:23.666
You pulled your weapon.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.233
Yeah, I did.

10:25.276 --> 10:26.626
After he hit her.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.540
We have a complaint from
a witness on the scene

10:28.584 --> 10:30.978
that says that you menaced
Gillette with your weapon

10:31.021 --> 10:32.327
for no reason.

10:33.676 --> 10:36.026
IAB will be looking into it.

10:36.070 --> 10:39.987
IAB? Are... are you serious?

10:40.030 --> 10:41.641
You're being modified pending

10:41.684 --> 10:43.294
the outcome
of the investigation.

10:43.338 --> 10:44.731
But, boss, I...

10:44.774 --> 10:46.602
Your gun and shield.

11:04.707 --> 11:07.579
I was sitting in the back seat
of our car,

11:07.623 --> 11:10.670
an old Vista Cruiser
parked here,

11:10.713 --> 11:12.541
waiting for my dad
to drive me to the beach.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.674
Down the block,
in front of that church,

11:14.717 --> 11:17.589
I saw two people arguing.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.156
Did you recognize
either of them?

11:19.200 --> 11:21.768
Reggie Lewis
and Sandra Harris.

11:21.811 --> 11:24.335
She cleaned houses and he
worked in the barber shop.

11:24.379 --> 11:27.077
What were they arguing about?I couldn't really hear.

11:27.121 --> 11:28.688
But she was upset.

11:28.731 --> 11:29.776
I saw her

11:29.819 --> 11:31.255
pull a gun from her bag,

11:31.299 --> 11:32.779
and she just aimed it at him

11:32.822 --> 11:35.564
and shot him in the chest.

11:36.739 --> 11:40.047
Did either of them see you?She never looked
around. She just

11:40.090 --> 11:42.136
shot him and then
she turned around

11:42.179 --> 11:43.050
and ran away.

11:43.093 --> 11:44.747
How come you never came forward?

11:44.791 --> 11:47.402
Word was Reggie
had ties to a gang.

11:47.445 --> 11:49.056
I was 13.

11:49.099 --> 11:51.493
My parents were scared.
I was scared.

11:51.536 --> 11:53.495
Mostly, they didn't
trust the cops.

11:53.538 --> 11:55.062
What ever happened
to Sandra Harris?

11:55.105 --> 11:57.064
She moved out
two weeks after the murder

11:57.107 --> 11:58.805
and no one ever
heard from her again.

11:58.848 --> 12:00.545
Did the cops look into Harris
for the murder?

12:00.589 --> 12:01.808
She was questioned.

12:01.851 --> 12:03.374
There wasn't much
of an investigation.

12:03.418 --> 12:05.333
For a murder in broad daylight?

12:05.376 --> 12:08.423
1993.
A Black man killed in Harlem?

12:08.466 --> 12:10.294
It didn't even make the paper.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.819
Well, the gun was recovered.

12:12.862 --> 12:15.865
There are prints on it,
but there was never a match.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.867
Yeah, but if we can
locate Sandra Harris,

12:17.911 --> 12:20.957
we could, uh,
see if there is a match.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.916
Why, all of a sudden,
with all the cases we have,

12:22.959 --> 12:25.309
did you decide
to reopen this one?

12:25.353 --> 12:27.790
I thought you would want to.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.619
I-I thought it would
help bring closure.

12:31.925 --> 12:34.275
A lot of times
closure's overrated.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.413
[door opens, shuts]

12:42.457 --> 12:43.980
You modified Witten?

12:44.024 --> 12:45.286
So?So, she didn't

12:45.329 --> 12:46.635
do anything wrong.Then I'm sure IAB

12:46.678 --> 12:48.071
will clear her.

12:48.115 --> 12:49.290
She gets assaulted,
and then she's placed

12:49.333 --> 12:50.465
on modified assignment.

12:50.508 --> 12:51.901
How's that make sense?Very simple.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.642
She menaced a citizen.

12:53.685 --> 12:54.643
A citizen that assaulted her.

12:54.686 --> 12:55.600
She has no physical injury

12:55.644 --> 12:57.124
and she pulled a gun.

12:57.167 --> 12:59.604
You get hit from behind,
you pull your weapon

12:59.648 --> 13:01.432
because you got no idea
what's coming next.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.739
And now there's a video
of a cop holding a gun

13:03.783 --> 13:06.829
on a bunch
of unarmed bystanders.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.309
We cannot have that.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.963
We can't modify officers
without cause.

13:10.006 --> 13:12.879
Excuse me, did you get promoted
and I don't know about it?

13:12.922 --> 13:14.097
Because the last time I looked,

13:14.141 --> 13:15.359
you were a sergeant
and I was a captain.

13:15.403 --> 13:16.491
Yeah, then act like one.

13:16.534 --> 13:17.709
You should be
standing up for your cops.

13:17.753 --> 13:18.841
You have five seconds to
get the hell out

13:18.885 --> 13:20.974
of my office, Sergeant.

13:26.153 --> 13:27.894
Can you think of anyone
who might have wanted

13:27.937 --> 13:29.286
to hurt you or your wife--

13:29.330 --> 13:31.114
some form of retaliation
or something?

13:31.158 --> 13:32.072
No.

13:32.115 --> 13:33.638
I noticed you
have no tattoos,

13:33.682 --> 13:35.118
so I'm assuming
no gang affiliation.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.641
Wait, my son's on a ventilator

13:36.685 --> 13:37.947
and you're asking me
if I'm in a gang?

13:37.991 --> 13:40.297
There's a lot of gang activity
in that area.

13:40.341 --> 13:41.342
I got to bring it up.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.344
Look, man,
I'm not in a gang, okay?

13:43.387 --> 13:44.824
Okay.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.826
Can you think of anyone
you may have had words with?

13:46.869 --> 13:48.349
I mean, I got into
a little back and forth

13:48.392 --> 13:50.046
with a guy before the party,
but that was nothing.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.179
What was it about?He told me to
turn off the music

13:52.222 --> 13:53.702
and I told him to go to hell.

13:53.745 --> 13:54.877
Do you know who this guy was?

13:54.921 --> 13:56.357
I heard his girlfriend
call him Larry

13:56.400 --> 13:59.229
when she pulled him away.Do you know where he lives?

13:59.273 --> 14:02.624
Hon.I got to go.

14:05.148 --> 14:07.890
[dialogue inaudible]

14:07.934 --> 14:09.500
[sobbing]
No, please, no.

14:11.981 --> 14:14.201
â™ª

14:24.341 --> 14:25.168
Hi.

14:25.212 --> 14:27.779
You didn't have to come by.

14:31.174 --> 14:32.088
You gonna invite me in?

14:32.132 --> 14:33.916
Yeah.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.571
I just wanted to come by
and make sure

14:36.614 --> 14:38.051
that you weren't...

14:39.095 --> 14:40.096
...you know,

14:40.140 --> 14:43.491
maxing out
on junk food and...

14:43.534 --> 14:44.709
vodka.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.798
But thank God.
I feel so much better now.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.104
I'm fine, Eddie.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.932
I'm not fine.
None of this is fine.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.065
You didn't do anything wrong.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.370
And yet...

14:53.414 --> 14:55.938
Once this investigation is over,

14:55.982 --> 14:57.113
you'll be cleared.

14:57.157 --> 14:58.549
Then everything will
go back to normal?

14:58.593 --> 14:59.855
Eh.People will stop

14:59.899 --> 15:01.639
looking at us
like we're the enemy?

15:01.683 --> 15:04.381
I was at the gym yesterday
and there was a guy there

15:04.425 --> 15:08.037
wearing a shirt that said,
"Blue Lives Murder."Hey, it's just one guy.

15:08.081 --> 15:12.128
I was reading one of those
cheesy magazines

15:12.172 --> 15:14.565
with all the quizzes, and...

15:14.609 --> 15:17.525
you meet your 18-year-old self,
and you only have three words.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.875
What do you say?

15:19.919 --> 15:22.095
You know, the first thing
I thought of...

15:22.138 --> 15:23.313
What?

15:23.357 --> 15:25.881
"No police department."

15:25.925 --> 15:28.144
What are you saying,
that you don't want to

15:28.188 --> 15:29.711
be one anymore?
Come on.

15:29.754 --> 15:32.627
I don't know. Maybe.

15:32.670 --> 15:35.673
Witten, it was just routine.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.110
Someone calls and complains,

15:37.153 --> 15:38.981
the department has to
go through the motions.

15:39.025 --> 15:41.157
They took my gun and shield.

15:41.201 --> 15:42.985
That doesn't feel like
going through the motions.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.726
That feels like
a public humiliation.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.684
I'm sorry.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.512
Stop.

15:48.556 --> 15:50.862
I want to make sure
that you know that

15:50.906 --> 15:52.864
I'm here for you
no matter what.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.431
With the last name Reagan.

15:54.475 --> 15:57.217
Ooh, I hope you're not
talking about the commissioner,

15:57.260 --> 16:00.481
who singlehandedly
reinstated you.

16:00.524 --> 16:03.049
Come on, he has
your back. So do I.

16:03.092 --> 16:05.660
Look, I'm... I'm really fine.

16:07.357 --> 16:11.709
I'll call you tomorrow.
I promise.

16:11.753 --> 16:14.103
Okay.

16:16.584 --> 16:18.978
Um, hey, I just...

16:19.021 --> 16:20.240
I thought that they asked you

16:20.283 --> 16:23.025
to turn in all of your guns.

16:26.855 --> 16:29.336
[sighs]
It was my dad's,

16:29.379 --> 16:31.164
from when he was
on the job.

16:31.207 --> 16:33.122
I'm sentimental about it.

16:33.166 --> 16:37.170
I know this is hard for you.

16:37.213 --> 16:39.563
And I'm here if you need me.

16:39.607 --> 16:42.958
Well, no one is better
at a pep talk than you.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.874
To the point of nausea,
actually.

16:45.917 --> 16:49.008
Oh. Well, that's
good to know.

16:49.051 --> 16:50.661
[chuckles]

16:50.705 --> 16:52.533
Good night.

17:25.218 --> 17:27.916
Are you ready to go home
or are you sleeping here?

17:27.959 --> 17:29.613
It's late.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.441
[sighs]

17:31.485 --> 17:33.835
Some days don't end
by the clock.

17:33.878 --> 17:36.055
Okay.

17:46.326 --> 17:49.242
Any update on that
mother's boy in the hospital?

17:49.285 --> 17:52.419
Eli Chesnick had surgery
to remove the bullet.

17:52.462 --> 17:54.508
He's in ICU,
but it's touch-and-go.

17:54.551 --> 17:57.815
Looks like we found
our guy in the bus shooting.

17:57.859 --> 17:59.382
His car plate
was altered,

17:59.426 --> 18:00.949
but we were able
to locate him

18:00.992 --> 18:03.734
using a bumper sticker
and an anonymous tip.

18:03.778 --> 18:06.650
Who's the guy?One Kenny Kilmer.

18:06.694 --> 18:09.088
42, lives in
Dyker Heights.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.524
His social media
is full of rants

18:10.567 --> 18:12.091
against just about everyone.

18:12.134 --> 18:14.789
He been arrested five times
for aggravated harassment

18:14.832 --> 18:17.400
and assault, but gets
released every time.

18:17.444 --> 18:20.142
And he's been in and out of
mental hospitals his whole life.

18:21.970 --> 18:25.843
And why do I think that's not
what you stayed late to tell me?

18:29.804 --> 18:31.675
The mayor has scheduled
a press conference

18:31.719 --> 18:35.114
for tomorrow morning to announce
the shooter's arrest.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.467
Solo.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.908
Hmm.

18:46.951 --> 18:48.039
Wow.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.259
Like learning you're
getting divorced

18:50.303 --> 18:52.000
from a scheduling update.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.959
[sighs]

18:55.003 --> 18:56.570
I don't know.

19:00.313 --> 19:01.879
Hey.

19:01.923 --> 19:05.056
You ever go visit
the Statue of Liberty?

19:05.100 --> 19:07.624
Yeah. Once.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.670
I always loved that
she was a woman,

19:09.713 --> 19:12.151
especially growing up
in a house full of boys.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.457
She looks kind of pissed off,
you ask me.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.677
Well, I can relate to that, too.

19:16.720 --> 19:21.203
Why does Crawford think
I'm trying to sabotage her

19:21.247 --> 19:22.596
by opening up this case?

19:22.639 --> 19:26.513
It's simple. She's a D.A.
and you're a Reagan.

19:26.556 --> 19:28.471
It's a murder.
It should be solved.

19:28.515 --> 19:30.821
Yeah, well, there's a lot
of cases need to be solved.

19:30.865 --> 19:32.214
Why this one?

19:32.258 --> 19:36.044
I guess I was trying
to find some common ground,

19:36.087 --> 19:37.785
some insight into her.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.526
Yeah, and what if
the insight you get,

19:39.569 --> 19:41.005
uh, makes you
wish you hadn't?

19:41.049 --> 19:43.573
What is that supposed to mean?Look, Sandra Harris

19:43.617 --> 19:45.488
was a person of interest
in the murder,

19:45.532 --> 19:47.011
but was never charged.

19:47.055 --> 19:48.317
And there were rumblings

19:48.361 --> 19:50.754
that it was an abusive
relationship.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.234
She have an alibi?

19:52.278 --> 19:53.931
She said she was
home at the time.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.933
Her daughter backed her up.

19:55.977 --> 19:57.108
She has a daughter?

19:57.152 --> 19:58.893
Leticia.

19:58.936 --> 20:00.851
And?

20:00.895 --> 20:04.246
And guess who was
best friends with Leticia.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.900
Your friend, the D.A.

20:05.943 --> 20:08.642
Yeah, that's right.

20:12.994 --> 20:17.955
I got a Larry Wilson
residing at 450 East 121st.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.088
How old?28.

20:20.131 --> 20:21.524
Great. Flag it.Probably just

20:21.568 --> 20:23.396
another dead end.Yeah.

20:23.439 --> 20:26.094
Speaking of dead ends,

20:26.137 --> 20:27.922
I actually paid a visit

20:27.965 --> 20:31.099
to Maggie Gibson yesterday.
You know, the medium?

20:31.142 --> 20:33.797
Because you were
looking for help

20:33.841 --> 20:36.496
or looking for an
excuse to see her?

20:36.539 --> 20:38.498
I was going to see her for help.

20:38.541 --> 20:41.370
She's been very helpful
in the past, right?

20:41.414 --> 20:44.330
We're running into dead ends,
and she's been right

20:44.373 --> 20:46.810
on our cases on more
than one occasion.

20:46.854 --> 20:49.160
I get it.

20:49.204 --> 20:50.466
Maybe she'll come up
with something.

20:50.510 --> 20:52.294
I got a Larry Knoll.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.035
Lives across
from the playground.

20:54.078 --> 20:55.993
He's got a prior for assault.

20:56.037 --> 20:57.430
Really?

20:57.473 --> 20:59.910
Well, let's pay this
Larry Knoll a visit.

21:02.870 --> 21:05.351
Footage from inside
and outside the deli.

21:05.394 --> 21:08.832
You'll see when you watch it
that it exonerates Witten.

21:08.876 --> 21:10.312
Where'd you get this?

21:10.356 --> 21:11.835
The owner of the deli
called me up, gave it to me.

21:11.879 --> 21:13.315
You should have
referred it to IAB

21:13.359 --> 21:14.838
instead of playing
detective.

21:14.882 --> 21:16.971
I'm not playing anything.You think because

21:17.014 --> 21:19.626
your name is Reagan
that you can bigfoot me.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.236
That's not what
I'm doing here, boss.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.324
It's disrespectful.

21:22.368 --> 21:24.326
No disrespect intended.

21:24.370 --> 21:27.068
I even catch you
whispering about this case,

21:27.111 --> 21:28.417
I'm gonna write you up.

21:28.461 --> 21:30.289
Good to know you have my back
as well as Witten's.

21:30.332 --> 21:32.334
Noted, Sergeant Reagan.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.249
Oh, by the way,
I need you to address

21:34.293 --> 21:35.816
a precinct condition.

21:35.859 --> 21:40.168
Set up a DWI checkpoint
from 2200 hours to 0600 hours.

21:40.211 --> 21:43.084
DWI. You want me to stand around
babysitting a bunch of rookies?

21:43.127 --> 21:44.520
Are you refusing the assignment?

21:44.564 --> 21:46.783
No.

21:46.827 --> 21:48.611
Dismissed.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.964
Excuse me, sir.

21:54.008 --> 21:55.879
Detective Reagan.
My partner, Detective Baez.

21:55.923 --> 21:57.751
We're looking for a Larry Knoll.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.100
That's me.

21:59.143 --> 22:00.362
Would you mind putting
that down, please, sir?

22:02.843 --> 22:04.192
What's this about?

22:04.235 --> 22:05.454
It's about an altercation

22:05.498 --> 22:07.500
you had yesterday
with a Marcus Carter.

22:07.543 --> 22:09.632
I don't even know who that is.He's the guy

22:09.676 --> 22:11.417
you told to shut off his music.

22:11.460 --> 22:12.461
The guy you threatened.

22:12.505 --> 22:13.984
I didn't
threaten anybody.

22:14.028 --> 22:15.421
That's not what we heard.

22:15.464 --> 22:17.423
I told him to lower his music.
That's a crime?

22:17.466 --> 22:20.426
No, but if you return
to the scene a while later

22:20.469 --> 22:22.123
and shoot up the place,
well, that's a crime.

22:22.166 --> 22:25.344
Are you serious? You're here
about the shooting yesterday?

22:25.387 --> 22:26.693
I-I didn't shoot anybody.

22:26.736 --> 22:27.955
But you own a Glock.

22:27.998 --> 22:31.001
Yes, I do, and a full
carry permit for it.

22:31.045 --> 22:32.481
Can we see your gun?

22:32.525 --> 22:34.657
Yeah. Get a warrant.

22:34.701 --> 22:37.704
Look, for a guy who's innocent,

22:37.747 --> 22:39.488
you're being pretty defensive.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.011
I work late nights.

22:41.055 --> 22:43.013
I go to bed sometimes
4:00 in the morning.

22:43.057 --> 22:44.406
Is it too much to ask that jerk

22:44.450 --> 22:46.060
not to blast his music
under my window

22:46.103 --> 22:47.322
when I'm trying to sleep?

22:47.366 --> 22:49.977
And now you're sounding
a little angry.

22:50.020 --> 22:53.372
You know what?
I didn't shoot anyone.

22:53.415 --> 22:56.026
Where were you yesterday
at 11:15?

22:56.070 --> 22:57.854
I never left my apartment.

22:57.898 --> 23:00.335
And the super can verify that
because he was there

23:00.379 --> 23:02.337
with the plumber fixing a leak,

23:02.381 --> 23:03.947
because no one cares
if you work nights.

23:03.991 --> 23:05.732
We'll check it out.

23:05.775 --> 23:08.822
Be my guest.

23:08.865 --> 23:10.519
Maybe Maggie didn't know

23:10.563 --> 23:11.825
what she was talking
about after all.

23:11.868 --> 23:14.654
Okay, what's your problem
with Maggie now?

23:14.697 --> 23:16.743
She's not grounded
in reality.

23:16.786 --> 23:18.745
Well, maybe that's
a good thing.

23:18.788 --> 23:20.964
I mean, we all need
an escape from reality.

23:21.008 --> 23:22.531
Ballistics are back.

23:22.575 --> 23:24.403
The bullet that killed
Michael Carter

23:24.446 --> 23:26.883
matches a gang murder
from five years ago.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.407
And that's why.

23:28.450 --> 23:29.886
Reality sucks.

23:36.719 --> 23:38.199
Miss Harris, thank you
for coming in.

23:38.242 --> 23:39.592
I'm A.D.A. Erin Reagan.

23:39.635 --> 23:41.550
This is Investigator
Abetamarco.

23:41.594 --> 23:44.118
I am Leticia Harris,
representing my mother.

23:45.162 --> 23:47.730
What is this about?Well, I mentioned
on the phone that, uh,

23:47.774 --> 23:50.516
we're taking a look at the
murder of Reggie Lewis.

23:50.559 --> 23:51.952
Is there some new evidence?

23:51.995 --> 23:53.344
An eyewitness.

23:53.388 --> 23:55.259
Who decided to come forward
three decades later.

23:55.303 --> 23:57.958
What was the nature
of your relationship

23:58.001 --> 24:01.004
with Mr. Lewis
at the time of the murder?

24:01.048 --> 24:03.311
We didn't have a relationship.

24:04.399 --> 24:06.314
We heard that
you were dating him.

24:06.357 --> 24:08.055
We might have
gone on a couple dates.

24:08.098 --> 24:10.884
But you just said that
you were not in a relationship.

24:10.927 --> 24:12.799
A date isn't a relationship.

24:12.842 --> 24:14.191
Was he abusive?

24:14.235 --> 24:15.541
What are you getting at?

24:15.584 --> 24:17.499
I'm trying to establish
if your mother

24:17.543 --> 24:19.675
ever fought
with Mr. Lewis.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.984
I don't recall.

24:24.637 --> 24:25.942
Is my mother a suspect?

24:25.986 --> 24:29.642
Your mother
has always been a suspect.

24:29.685 --> 24:30.425
LETICIA:
She already gave

24:30.469 --> 24:31.557
her statements.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.906
Nothing has changed.

24:32.949 --> 24:36.083
Unless you are charging her,
we are leaving.

24:43.917 --> 24:46.920
So what do you think?
She guilty?

24:46.963 --> 24:50.750
I think once we
lift her prints from this,

24:50.793 --> 24:52.795
and run it against
the ones on the gun,

24:52.839 --> 24:54.667
we will see.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.495
You're pretty clever.

24:56.538 --> 24:57.800
Boop.

24:57.844 --> 24:59.236
Oh, maybe I shouldn't have

24:59.280 --> 25:00.847
brought you coffee.I need another refill.

25:00.890 --> 25:02.892
Thank you.

25:02.936 --> 25:04.764
Uh, how is the case going?

25:04.807 --> 25:07.549
Well, the dad's alibi
checked out,

25:07.593 --> 25:11.510
so your intuition about him
being involved

25:11.553 --> 25:12.989
didn't pan out.

25:13.033 --> 25:16.427
It's not intuition.

25:17.603 --> 25:20.519
And I guarantee you the
reason for that baby's death

25:20.562 --> 25:21.955
is because of the father.

25:21.998 --> 25:24.261
Well, I can't afford
to be wrong on this one.

25:24.305 --> 25:27.308
You're not looking
in the right place.

25:27.351 --> 25:28.744
And you got all this
from a sock?

25:28.788 --> 25:30.354
Yeah, I did.

25:30.398 --> 25:33.401
Okay.

25:33.444 --> 25:34.445
I'm sorry.

25:34.489 --> 25:36.491
I'm tired, I'm frustrated.

25:36.535 --> 25:39.233
I know you have a gift.

25:39.276 --> 25:42.279
You really throw yourself
into your work.

25:42.323 --> 25:44.760
Well, I like to think that's
what makes me a good detective.

25:44.804 --> 25:47.154
It also deprives you of joy.

25:47.197 --> 25:48.372
Joy?

25:48.416 --> 25:49.896
When was the last time
that you went out?

25:49.939 --> 25:51.462
I mean, like, out to have fun.

25:51.506 --> 25:53.464
I don't know.
I... I don't know.

25:53.508 --> 25:55.466
I took my son out to a game. I..No, no.

25:55.510 --> 25:57.164
When was the last time
you went out with a woman?

25:57.207 --> 25:58.905
Uh, where you going with this?

25:58.948 --> 26:00.080
No, not romantically, man.

26:00.123 --> 26:02.082
I mean just, like, as a friend

26:02.125 --> 26:04.171
to enjoy her company.

26:08.392 --> 26:10.307
I don't know.

26:10.351 --> 26:12.353
Bye.

26:13.354 --> 26:15.051
Bye.

26:21.362 --> 26:23.320
I'm sure glad they got
that school bus shooter.

26:23.364 --> 26:26.672
Yeah, there's something about
crimes against kids.DANNY: Tell me about it.

26:26.715 --> 26:28.282
I got a vic
who's a five-year-old.

26:28.325 --> 26:29.762
Any closer to the arrest?

26:29.805 --> 26:31.459
No, not yet.

26:31.502 --> 26:35.202
That's what really gets to me:
the murder of the innocents.

26:35.245 --> 26:36.725
Yeah, and hate crimes.

26:36.769 --> 26:38.074
All crimes are hate crimes.

26:38.118 --> 26:39.772
No such thing as a love crime.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.643
I noticed the mayor
held a press conference

26:41.687 --> 26:43.471
for the school bus
shooting arrest on his own.

26:43.514 --> 26:44.646
How come you weren't there?

26:44.690 --> 26:46.735
You have to ask him.

26:46.779 --> 26:48.171
Mm.

26:48.215 --> 26:49.608
Does that mean that the mayor
is pissed at you?

26:50.696 --> 26:53.568
That's exactly what it means.
Good for Francis.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.962
Let me guess--
he's worried about tourism.

26:56.005 --> 26:59.443
He should spend a night
in a radio car answering calls.

26:59.487 --> 27:01.968
Or in an ER with a vic's family.

27:02.011 --> 27:06.407
Have any of you ever thought
about leaving the department?

27:07.843 --> 27:09.105
What do you mean?

27:09.149 --> 27:10.672
Well, the job gets to you.

27:10.716 --> 27:13.675
A case gets to you so much
you feel like packing it in.

27:16.809 --> 27:19.202
Yeah.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.511
Wait a minute, you don't
get to answer that one.

27:23.554 --> 27:25.034
What? It's not thejob,

27:25.078 --> 27:27.123
but it's a job that can
grind you down.

27:27.167 --> 27:28.385
This week in particular

27:28.429 --> 27:30.736
I thought a lot about
how nice it would be

27:30.779 --> 27:32.259
not to be an A.D.A.

27:32.302 --> 27:35.001
You thinking of
a new career, Eddie?

27:35.044 --> 27:36.698
I think Witten is.

27:38.047 --> 27:39.179
She feels like

27:39.222 --> 27:40.528
nobody is on her side.

27:40.571 --> 27:42.704
Well, that's 'cause nobody is.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.967
Well, that's not true.

27:45.011 --> 27:46.577
Eh...

27:46.621 --> 27:48.318
Awful lot of hate directed
at cops, especially lately.

27:48.362 --> 27:50.451
And it's not just cops.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.279
It's like get in line.

27:52.322 --> 27:54.585
It feels like every week
there's some random person

27:54.629 --> 27:56.587
getting attacked on the
streets for no reason.

27:56.631 --> 27:58.720
And you wonder why
he wasn't invited

27:58.764 --> 28:00.156
to the press conference?

28:00.200 --> 28:02.724
How do you get people
to just stop hating?

28:02.768 --> 28:06.119
[scoffs] I don't know,
like this. What we do.

28:06.162 --> 28:07.686
We talk, we listen.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.252
DANNY:
Well,

28:09.296 --> 28:10.993
mostly, you talk,

28:11.037 --> 28:12.908
and we just sit around
and listen.

28:12.952 --> 28:15.171
[laughter]

28:16.607 --> 28:19.393
Well...

28:21.221 --> 28:23.484
ABETEMARCO: Hello.[door closes]

28:23.527 --> 28:27.444
Sandra Harris, uh,
gave us her alibi.

28:27.488 --> 28:30.143
And we compared her prints
with the ones on the gun.

28:30.186 --> 28:31.405
And it's a match.

28:31.448 --> 28:33.059
But you already
knew it would be.

28:33.102 --> 28:34.843
I know what I saw.

28:34.887 --> 28:37.498
You didn't tell us that
she had a daughter your age,

28:37.541 --> 28:39.239
or that you and Leticia were...

28:39.282 --> 28:40.849
Best friends.

28:40.893 --> 28:44.331
You watched your best friend's
mother kill her boyfriend,

28:44.374 --> 28:47.334
and you didn't come forward.Sandra was

28:47.377 --> 28:49.292
a single mom.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.773
I knew if I came forward,
Leticia would have been

28:51.817 --> 28:53.296
put into the system.

28:53.340 --> 28:56.125
Which means two people
would have died that day.

28:56.169 --> 28:58.214
You let her get away
with murder.

28:58.258 --> 29:00.869
Not everything
is black and white, Erin.

29:00.913 --> 29:03.263
Even at 13,
I knew that if I

29:03.306 --> 29:06.135
testified, who would believe
the word of a child?

29:06.179 --> 29:08.181
It wouldn't have been enough.
No one else

29:08.224 --> 29:09.748
came forward because
everyone knew

29:09.791 --> 29:12.359
that Reggie Lewis
used to abuse Sandra.

29:12.402 --> 29:14.056
She always had
marks on her face

29:14.100 --> 29:16.319
that she tried to hide
with makeup.

29:16.363 --> 29:17.451
So you think that's why
she killed him--

29:17.494 --> 29:19.018
she finally had enough?

29:19.061 --> 29:21.150
I really don't know.What you're
basically saying

29:21.194 --> 29:24.284
is it was
a community service murder.

29:24.327 --> 29:26.634
She killed a man in cold blood.

29:26.677 --> 29:28.767
She planned it,
and I watched it,

29:28.810 --> 29:31.247
and I did nothing.

29:31.291 --> 29:33.206
And I'm embarrassed about that.

29:33.249 --> 29:35.251
But do I regret
my decision?

29:35.295 --> 29:38.080
No, I do not.

29:38.124 --> 29:40.126
I was protecting myself,

29:40.169 --> 29:43.912
my family and my friend.

29:43.956 --> 29:45.435
I'd do it again.

29:45.479 --> 29:49.135
This is just not
what I was expecting.

29:50.310 --> 29:52.573
I-I don't know what
I'm supposed to do with this.

29:52.616 --> 29:53.704
Yes, you do.

29:53.748 --> 29:56.098
We're going to arrest
Sandra Harris

29:56.142 --> 29:59.319
for the murder of Reggie Lewis.

30:03.932 --> 30:06.848
You were released from prison
a month ago. You certainly

30:06.892 --> 30:09.242
didn't take long to
look for trouble.

30:09.285 --> 30:10.765
I haven't missed a meeting
with my P.O.,

30:10.809 --> 30:12.375
so you can't be coming here
harassing me.

30:12.419 --> 30:13.681
No one's harassing you.

30:13.724 --> 30:15.204
Okay? We're just asking
a few questions.

30:15.248 --> 30:17.206
So why don't we start with

30:17.250 --> 30:19.643
where were you
on Thursday at 11:15 a.m.?

30:19.687 --> 30:20.601
Why?

30:20.644 --> 30:21.863
A little boy was
shot to death.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.256
The bullets matched
the ones used

30:23.299 --> 30:25.084
in the murder
you did time for.

30:25.127 --> 30:27.390
No way.

30:27.434 --> 30:29.305
I had nothing to do with that.

30:29.349 --> 30:32.439
Okay. You happen
to have any guns here?

30:32.482 --> 30:33.309
No, 'cause that'd be

30:33.353 --> 30:35.137
violating my parole.

30:35.181 --> 30:37.226
Danny.

30:41.013 --> 30:43.319
You mind telling me who that is

30:43.363 --> 30:45.582
in the picture there with you?

30:48.498 --> 30:50.152
It was my girlfriend,
but we broke up.

30:50.196 --> 30:51.806
Girlfriend.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.721
And you were hoping
to get back with her?

30:53.764 --> 30:57.159
Nah. She moved on.
I got no beef with her.

30:57.203 --> 30:59.901
She moved on with another guy.

30:59.945 --> 31:01.381
You were jealous, maybe,

31:01.424 --> 31:03.905
and feeling a little rage
about the fact that

31:03.949 --> 31:06.734
he was raising your son?What are you talking about?

31:06.777 --> 31:10.694
Your son. She's pregnant
in the picture there.

31:10.738 --> 31:13.175
I'm assuming she had
the baby. Your baby.

31:13.219 --> 31:14.568
Little boy named Michael?

31:14.611 --> 31:18.180
It only takes a few minutes
to test DNA.

31:18.224 --> 31:20.182
Michael's my son. So?

31:20.226 --> 31:23.751
So... you didn't even realize

31:23.794 --> 31:25.579
that you murdered your own son?

31:25.622 --> 31:27.537
I didn't shoot Michael.

31:29.670 --> 31:31.324
Well, you might not have
aimed at him,

31:31.367 --> 31:33.587
but that's who you shot.

31:35.719 --> 31:37.330
Who were you aiming at, Jason?

31:37.373 --> 31:41.595
I wasn't aiming at Michael.

31:43.292 --> 31:46.600
I swear, I didn't even
see him there.

31:46.643 --> 31:50.169
You mind stepping over here,
sir, please?

31:50.212 --> 31:51.953
Right here.

31:51.997 --> 31:56.392
Turn around.
Hands behind your back.

31:56.436 --> 31:59.308
Jason Chavez,
you're under arrest

31:59.352 --> 32:01.397
for the murder
of Michael Carter.

32:01.441 --> 32:04.487
His name is Michael Chavez.

32:04.531 --> 32:07.882
I'm his father, not that guy.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.493
Okay. Let's go, Dad.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.497
He hit her.

32:14.541 --> 32:15.803
The crowd started taunting,

32:15.846 --> 32:17.718
and they were
calling us murderers.

32:17.761 --> 32:19.241
You do know you're here
as a witness?

32:19.285 --> 32:20.416
I know why I'm here.

32:20.460 --> 32:21.940
So there's no reason
to be defensive.

32:21.983 --> 32:24.768
If I don't defend
my partner, who will?

32:24.812 --> 32:26.248
We're not here
to prosecute her.

32:26.292 --> 32:27.989
We're just here
to find the truth.The truth?

32:28.033 --> 32:31.601
She's a great cop who's being
raked over the coals

32:31.645 --> 32:33.168
for no reason.

32:33.212 --> 32:35.649
She pulled her weapon
on an unarmed man.Perp.

32:35.692 --> 32:37.172
And showed no visible injuries.

32:37.216 --> 32:39.348
Why don't I tell you about
the invisible injuries?

32:39.392 --> 32:40.567
You want to hear about those?

32:40.610 --> 32:42.351
How about you just
answer our questions?

32:42.395 --> 32:45.615
Why does it feel like
she is being presumed guilty

32:45.659 --> 32:47.356
until proven innocent?

32:47.400 --> 32:49.271
Isn't it supposed to be
the other way around?

32:49.315 --> 32:52.013
We haven't made
a final determination

32:52.057 --> 32:55.016
You are supposed
to be impartial.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.583
But that's what's wrong,
right, these days?

32:56.626 --> 32:58.672
Nobody's impartial.

32:58.715 --> 33:01.370
Cops are hated.

33:01.414 --> 33:04.939
That hate is infecting
this whole city,

33:04.983 --> 33:07.202
and frankly, it's infecting
this investigation.

33:07.246 --> 33:09.944
Because you can take
whatever you want,

33:09.988 --> 33:11.990
and you can twist it
to suit whatever

33:12.033 --> 33:14.122
you have already determined.

33:14.166 --> 33:17.125
But she's done nothing wrong.

33:17.952 --> 33:19.345
Are you done?

33:19.388 --> 33:21.521
Can we get on with
the questions now?

33:24.393 --> 33:26.308
What do you got?

33:26.352 --> 33:29.964
I promised the community
a bigger police presence.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.880
I know.
I watched the press conference.

33:34.795 --> 33:36.144
Gonna be tough
to make good on that

33:36.188 --> 33:38.016
with less police and less money.I'm not

33:38.059 --> 33:40.801
discussing rolling back
policies with you.

33:40.844 --> 33:42.455
Right now, my job is

33:42.498 --> 33:44.413
to get the city
back up to speed.

33:44.457 --> 33:47.242
The victim's parents
will be thrilled to hear that.

33:47.286 --> 33:49.157
There's always gonna be
random crime.

33:49.201 --> 33:50.854
And there is going
to be more of it

33:50.898 --> 33:52.030
if you don't work with me.

33:52.073 --> 33:53.379
"Work with you" translates to

33:53.422 --> 33:54.771
lift all the restrictions

33:54.815 --> 33:56.077
on your department.

33:56.121 --> 33:58.471
Reinstate Anti-Crime,
hire more cops.

33:58.514 --> 33:59.863
Great. Glad we agree.

33:59.907 --> 34:02.214
Answer's no. Let's move on.

34:04.433 --> 34:08.089
I heard you have an arrest
in that other shooting.

34:08.133 --> 34:09.786
We do.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.006
That's great.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.834
We should announce it
this afternoon.

34:13.877 --> 34:16.141
You can announce it.
I don't need to be there.

34:16.184 --> 34:17.490
You'll be there.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.883
I am not going to
stand next to you

34:19.927 --> 34:22.799
and pretend your policies
are working when they are not.

34:22.843 --> 34:25.106
Yeah, policies, plural.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.890
And some of mine
are working damn well.

34:26.934 --> 34:29.589
And yes, there's gonna be
some less-than-ideal impact

34:29.632 --> 34:31.634
in other areas,
and that's called

34:31.678 --> 34:33.245
governing in the real world.

34:33.288 --> 34:34.985
Me wanting to grow
back our economy

34:35.029 --> 34:38.380
isn't what's causing
your crime wave, Frank.

34:38.424 --> 34:40.295
My crime wave?

34:40.339 --> 34:43.168
It is your department.

34:43.211 --> 34:47.302
Well, at least
you got that right.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.785
[sighs]

35:03.666 --> 35:05.190
Did you make an arrest?

35:05.233 --> 35:06.582
I did.

35:06.626 --> 35:09.759
It was the father.

35:09.803 --> 35:11.152
The biological father.

35:11.196 --> 35:12.849
Oh.Apparently he was

35:12.893 --> 35:15.504
trying to shoot
Michael's stepdad

35:15.548 --> 35:18.812
'cause he was jealous
that he was raising

35:18.855 --> 35:20.161
his son as his own.

35:20.205 --> 35:22.294
Mm-hmm.Jealousy and rage.

35:22.337 --> 35:24.818
You were right, again.

35:24.861 --> 35:26.776
I wish I wasn't.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.822
You were also right about me.

35:28.865 --> 35:31.825
With Linda. I...

35:31.868 --> 35:34.219
I don't know, I...

35:34.262 --> 35:37.657
buried myself into my work
after she passed away,

35:37.700 --> 35:39.659
and I've talked to people
and tried

35:39.702 --> 35:41.182
to pull myself out of it,

35:41.226 --> 35:43.663
but somehow it seems
I just keep getting

35:43.706 --> 35:45.186
buried deeper in the job.

35:45.230 --> 35:48.320
I mean, my job
is not the same as yours,

35:48.363 --> 35:51.192
but it takes
a big emotional toll.

35:51.236 --> 35:52.672
I wouldn't be able
to continue doing it

35:52.715 --> 35:56.719
if I didn't let off some steam
every now and then.

35:56.763 --> 35:58.417
I'm trying.You know,

35:58.460 --> 36:02.334
there is a great karaoke place
two blocks away,

36:02.377 --> 36:06.033
and the only thing killer
are the margaritas.

36:06.076 --> 36:08.818
Karaoke's...
I-I don't think so.

36:08.862 --> 36:11.081
Come on, just two friends.

36:11.125 --> 36:13.040
I guarantee
you will have a great time.

36:13.083 --> 36:14.868
I know, and I thank you.
I just...

36:14.911 --> 36:15.912
Maybe another time.

36:15.956 --> 36:17.087
Okay.Okay.

36:17.131 --> 36:19.177
What are you gonna do with it?

36:19.220 --> 36:20.221
With...

36:20.265 --> 36:21.657
the sock.The sock.

36:21.701 --> 36:23.224
Uh-huh.

36:23.268 --> 36:26.227
You know, actually,
I was gonna give it

36:26.271 --> 36:27.750
to Michael's stepdad.

36:28.577 --> 36:30.492
The real man who raised him.

36:30.536 --> 36:32.015
I think that's good.

36:32.059 --> 36:33.582
Yeah.

36:33.626 --> 36:35.889
You don't have to carry
that stuff around, you know.

36:35.932 --> 36:37.195
I know.

36:39.762 --> 36:40.676
Hey.Hey.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.200
You meet your 18-year-old self,

36:42.243 --> 36:44.463
and you can only say
three words. What do you say?

36:44.506 --> 36:48.771
Skip law school. You?

36:48.815 --> 36:50.164
I don't know.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.339
How'd it go with IAB?

36:51.383 --> 36:53.472
Even if Witten
is returned to full duty,

36:53.515 --> 36:55.561
she's not sure she even wants
to be a cop.

36:55.604 --> 36:57.476
If you don't think
you can do this job,

36:57.519 --> 36:58.868
then you can't.

36:58.912 --> 37:00.348
[sighs]It challenges you
in so many ways,

37:00.392 --> 37:01.871
not the least of
which is up here.

37:01.915 --> 37:03.308
Especially lately.

37:03.351 --> 37:04.831
If she's not up for it,

37:04.874 --> 37:07.573
then she should leave
the Department.

37:07.616 --> 37:09.749
But it's not that
she's not strong enough,

37:09.792 --> 37:12.752
it's that the bad
is far outweighing the good.

37:12.795 --> 37:16.277
Not for everyone.
Not for you.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.236
That's true.

37:19.802 --> 37:23.284
But it's not like I've
experienced much good lately.

37:23.328 --> 37:26.026
Oh, yeah?
Well, hop in.

37:26.069 --> 37:27.332
Where are we going?

37:27.375 --> 37:30.030
You'll see, let's go.Get in.

37:30.073 --> 37:32.641
Take your hands off of her!
Why are you arresting her?

37:32.685 --> 37:35.078
Stop right now.
Take your hands off of her.

37:35.122 --> 37:36.254
Why are you arresting her?

37:36.297 --> 37:37.820
For the murder of Reggie Lewis.

37:37.864 --> 37:41.302
You have no evidence.
No witnesses.

37:41.346 --> 37:44.436
I saw her do it.

37:48.918 --> 37:50.442
Kim...

37:51.530 --> 37:53.401
Why are you doing this?

37:53.445 --> 37:56.099
I'm sorry.You're sorry?

37:56.143 --> 37:59.233
My mother is 65 years old.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.583
Reggie Lewis was 37.

38:01.627 --> 38:02.584
Mom.

38:02.628 --> 38:04.412
Mom, do not
say a word to the cops

38:04.456 --> 38:06.414
or the D.A.'s office.

38:06.458 --> 38:08.286
You cannot trust them.

38:09.156 --> 38:11.419
Come on, ma'am.

38:13.203 --> 38:14.553
You have nothing.

38:14.596 --> 38:17.599
Your mother's prints
are on the murder weapon.

38:20.994 --> 38:22.387
I'm a lawyer.

38:22.430 --> 38:23.997
I don't want anyone
talking to her

38:24.040 --> 38:25.477
unless I am present.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.087
That's fine.

38:27.130 --> 38:28.567
You'll never get a conviction.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.525
We'll see about that.

38:37.837 --> 38:40.579
This'll be your case.
I'll have to recuse myself.

38:40.622 --> 38:43.582
I'm sorry.
Opening this case,

38:43.625 --> 38:45.192
I thought I was helping.

38:45.235 --> 38:48.848
The next time you want
to help me, please don't.

39:14.264 --> 39:16.484
â™ª

39:31.369 --> 39:33.545
â™ª

39:45.687 --> 39:49.430
We're back at the scene
of the crime. Why?

39:49.474 --> 39:51.519
Can you get the trunk
for me?

39:51.563 --> 39:54.043
Anybody order some
new plexiglass?

39:54.087 --> 39:56.742
Officer Reagan.What are you doing?

39:56.785 --> 39:58.483
I came to, uh,
replace the plexiglass

39:58.526 --> 39:59.484
here on your counter.

39:59.527 --> 40:01.486
I don't understand.

40:01.529 --> 40:02.748
Also gonna have some
uniformed officers come by

40:02.791 --> 40:05.359
and check on your store
a few times a day.

40:05.403 --> 40:06.882
Thank you.

40:06.926 --> 40:08.362
Good.

40:08.406 --> 40:11.104
All right, well, you got
Phillips-head that'll fit these?

40:16.022 --> 40:17.371
Hmm.

40:17.415 --> 40:21.419
Three words that I would say
to my 18-year-old self.

40:21.462 --> 40:22.550
Mm-hmm.

40:22.594 --> 40:26.032
Marry Jamie Reagan.

40:31.820 --> 40:33.039
Hey.

40:33.082 --> 40:36.477
That's a pretty girly drink.Well, I can be

40:36.521 --> 40:38.044
girly sometimes.

40:38.087 --> 40:39.437
I got you a beer.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.613
Perfect. You read my mind.

40:43.005 --> 40:46.356
I am regretting
opening this case.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.576
I didn't know
how complicated it would get.

40:48.620 --> 40:50.491
Well, it gets
even more complicated.

40:50.535 --> 40:52.667
Turns out Reggie Lewis
also has kids.

40:52.711 --> 40:56.018
In fact, one of 'em's
a congresswoman in Brooklyn.

40:56.062 --> 40:57.585
Shannon Lewis?

40:57.629 --> 41:00.893
She heard about the arrest.
She's planned a press conference

41:00.936 --> 41:03.069
on the steps of Borough Hall
tomorrow.

41:03.112 --> 41:04.723
Great.

41:04.766 --> 41:06.725
You got any other good news?

41:06.768 --> 41:08.553
If it makes you feel any better,

41:08.596 --> 41:10.816
I admire you for what you do.

41:12.165 --> 41:14.733
For sticking my nose
where it doesn't belong

41:14.776 --> 41:16.822
and embarrassing my boss.

41:16.865 --> 41:18.301
Look, Sandra Harris
killed a guy,

41:18.345 --> 41:20.608
and a life is a life
no matter how complicated

41:20.652 --> 41:22.480
it makes things for Crawford.

41:22.523 --> 41:24.699
She probably hates me now.

41:24.743 --> 41:27.485
Nah.
She hated you way before this.

41:27.528 --> 41:30.009
Thanks.

41:33.186 --> 41:34.361
[vocalizing]

41:34.404 --> 41:36.450
Let's give it up
for Sheryl!

41:36.494 --> 41:38.626
[cheering]

41:40.367 --> 41:41.499
That was good.

41:41.542 --> 41:43.152
Fun, right?

41:43.196 --> 41:44.632
You ever get up there
and grab the mic?

41:44.676 --> 41:45.851
Course I do.Mm.

41:45.894 --> 41:48.331
What's your karaoke
go-to song?

41:48.375 --> 41:49.985
"I Will Survive."

41:50.029 --> 41:51.900
Mm, Gloria Gaynor.

41:51.944 --> 41:55.251
That's a kick-ass song.Thank you. Uh...

41:55.295 --> 41:56.862
I see what you're doing there.

41:56.905 --> 41:58.864
I'm not doing anything,
that's really my favorite song.

41:58.907 --> 42:02.215
Okay, who's next up?

42:05.610 --> 42:08.134
Me!

42:08.177 --> 42:10.223
I'm next.

42:11.398 --> 42:12.617
What are you doing?

42:12.660 --> 42:16.403
You said I should
start having some fun.

42:16.446 --> 42:18.361
Let's have some fun.

42:18.405 --> 42:20.842
[laughs]Gimme that mic!

42:20.886 --> 42:22.322
Yeah!â™ª

42:30.243 --> 42:32.158
[whoops]

42:35.857 --> 42:38.338
â™ª If you start me up

42:38.381 --> 42:41.428
â™ª If you start me up
I'll never stop. â™ª
