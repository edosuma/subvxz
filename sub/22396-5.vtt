00:05.166 --> 00:07.541
Ah! What a beautiful day
for a drive.

00:07.541 --> 00:08.790
What do you say, pal?

00:10.333 --> 00:11.874
Vroom!

00:12.249 --> 00:13.291
Head downtown?

00:15.374 --> 00:16.374
Cruise the strip.

00:19.249 --> 00:21.166
Take the scenic route out to the coast.

00:23.499 --> 00:24.499
And then...

00:24.957 --> 00:26.166
Surfs up!

00:27.041 --> 00:28.041
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:30.707 --> 00:32.166
Aw, come on.

00:32.166 --> 00:34.041
I got a new bathing suit.

00:36.582 --> 00:37.790
Hmph!

00:37.790 --> 00:39.832
You want to be
a grump? Fine!

00:39.832 --> 00:42.249
But you'll have to do it at the beach.

00:43.541 --> 00:44.874
Whoa!

00:51.790 --> 00:52.832
Huh?

01:07.874 --> 01:09.499
Mmm!

01:35.041 --> 01:36.374
Goodbye, Mickey!

01:36.374 --> 01:38.749
I'm borrowing your car
to get my nails did!

01:41.208 --> 01:43.124
Oh.
Such a gentleman.

01:43.124 --> 01:44.374
Goodbye, Mickey!

01:44.832 --> 01:46.790
I'm borrowing your car to get my nails...

01:53.416 --> 01:55.874
Of all the tomfoolery.
Huh!

02:03.041 --> 02:04.541
Huh?

02:08.832 --> 02:11.416
Is that you, Walt?

02:20.124 --> 02:21.208
Ha-ha!

02:23.582 --> 02:24.915
Now then, to the beach!

02:28.249 --> 02:29.374
Ah!

02:54.208 --> 02:57.083
At last!
The beach!

02:57.666 --> 02:58.666
Ha!

02:58.957 --> 03:01.374
Last one in is a rotten egg!

03:02.333 --> 03:03.333
Huh?

03:13.374 --> 03:16.291
Well, now I see why you
were down on surfs up.

03:16.291 --> 03:18.790
I guess the beach is
only fun for one of us.
