WEBVTT

00:02.236 --> 00:05.239
(high-pitched, strummed chords)

00:05.273 --> 00:08.276
(stringed instruments playing
The Simpsons theme song)

00:11.079 --> 00:12.813
(grunts, gasps)

00:12.846 --> 00:14.482
Huh?

00:14.515 --> 00:17.017
-(Bob's Burgers
theme song playing)
-Huh?

00:18.219 --> 00:19.553
(screams)

00:19.587 --> 00:21.522
(frantic grunting)

00:21.555 --> 00:22.856
Rats!

00:23.857 --> 00:25.326
(screams)

00:25.359 --> 00:27.061
-(whimpering)
-(Bob's Burgers theme fades)

00:27.095 --> 00:30.064
-Hey, is there someone
in the restaurant?
-Oh, yeah.

00:30.098 --> 00:32.766
-Aw, he looks scared.
-Can we keep him?
Can we keep him?

00:32.800 --> 00:33.901
-(Homer grunts)
-BOB: No.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.669
We'll name him Bob Number One.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.771
And, Dad, you can just go by
Bob Number Two,

00:37.805 --> 00:39.440
-or maybe no name at all.
-(Homer whimpering)

00:39.473 --> 00:41.609
Wait. Why would I be
Bob Number Two or no name?

00:41.642 --> 00:43.611
-I am Bob.
-Well, yeah, but this is Bob,

00:43.644 --> 00:45.546
so now we're, like, Bob and Bob.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.748
-I don't like it.
-You can't just name a guy Bob.

00:47.781 --> 00:50.418
-Yeah, you can.
Somebody did it to you.
-That's true.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.753
Bob Number Two is throwing out
some major 'tude right now.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.888
-Isn't he, though?
-Yeah, lose the 'tude.

00:54.922 --> 00:57.758
-BOB: It is kind of nice to have
someone in the restaurant.
-GENE: Yeah.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.527
-What's he doing?
-If he's robbing us,

00:59.560 --> 01:01.061
I feel sorry for him.

01:01.095 --> 01:03.397
No. Don't say that.
We're fun to rob.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.366
Maybe he's just looking
for the bathroom.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.600
You're overthinking it, bro!

01:06.634 --> 01:08.702
Just go anywhere!
I'll clean it up!

01:08.736 --> 01:10.538
(chuckles) No way.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.573
*

01:19.147 --> 01:21.582
HEAVENLY CHOIR:
* The Simpsons

01:21.615 --> 01:25.286
MALE VOICE:
* In Heaven!

01:26.487 --> 01:28.289
GOD:
Where is everybody?

01:28.322 --> 01:31.159
Didn't we just build
a whole new mixed-use complex

01:31.192 --> 01:32.760
for the baby boomers?

01:32.793 --> 01:34.728
Ugh.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.930
(dramatic piano music plays)

01:36.964 --> 01:39.133
I'm just following
the admissions criteria.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.235
Can't we just tweak them a bit?

01:41.269 --> 01:43.604
It's easier to get in
to Upper West Side preschools.

01:43.637 --> 01:46.307
All we're getting up here
are little old ladies

01:46.340 --> 01:48.809
and Promise Keepers.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.778
Have you accepted the Lord?

01:50.811 --> 01:52.913
I'm here, dimwit.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.815
Frankly, those guys
weird me out.

01:54.848 --> 01:57.785
We have interesting people.
Look, Tracy Morgan's here.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.787
Tracy, what are you doing here?

01:59.820 --> 02:02.656
-You're all better.
-Nobody tells me these things!

02:03.857 --> 02:05.859
(halo clanging)

02:09.230 --> 02:12.433
-You gonna stop that?
-Eh, it'll stop on its own.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.668
We've got to get
more people in here.

02:14.702 --> 02:17.805
Ned Flanders is about to talk
about that very topic.

02:19.207 --> 02:22.810
Do the people my daddy shoots
go to Heaven?

02:22.843 --> 02:24.778
They do if they haven't
done anything wrong.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.280
So, a lot of them, yes.

02:26.314 --> 02:29.583
Come on, kids, think about it.
Why do people get into Heaven?

02:30.184 --> 02:32.653
* Heaven

02:32.686 --> 02:35.155
* I'm in heaven

02:35.189 --> 02:40.027
* And my heart beats
so that I can hardly speak... *

02:40.060 --> 02:42.029
(gasps) Clayton Kersh...

02:42.062 --> 02:43.797
-(grunts)
-* I seem to find

02:43.831 --> 02:46.834
* The happiness I seek

02:46.867 --> 02:51.772
* When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek *

02:53.841 --> 02:56.043
* Heaven

02:56.076 --> 02:59.079
* I'm in heaven

02:59.112 --> 03:01.749
* And the cares
that hung around me *

03:01.782 --> 03:06.287
* Seem to vanish like
a gambler's lucky streak *

03:07.688 --> 03:10.491
* When we're out together

03:10.524 --> 03:13.126
-(sighs)
-* Dancing cheek to cheek.

03:14.595 --> 03:17.765
Well, nobody said Sunday school
kids were geniuses.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.568
Kids, there's only one way
into Heaven.

03:20.601 --> 03:23.103
Never stray from
the path of righteousness.

03:23.136 --> 03:24.538
Easy for you to say.

03:24.572 --> 03:27.408
With a mustache like that,
you're an obvious narc.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.677
The truth is,
this mustache is a memento

03:29.710 --> 03:31.712
of the awful sinner
I used to be.

03:31.745 --> 03:35.349
I was raised with no religion.
Our house was a den of bebop.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.385
(cool jazz music playing)

03:42.623 --> 03:46.093
Neddy, you're coloring
inside the lines.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.128
Rules are for fools, man!

03:48.161 --> 03:49.697
That's right, baby.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.799
Be free! Be free!

03:51.832 --> 03:54.468
Go off the page.
Write on the wall.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.203
Color a cloud purple.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.373
Jack and Jill
are on the pill, man!

03:59.407 --> 04:01.309
FLANDERS:
Godless and Maudeless,

04:01.342 --> 04:03.977
each job I took
became more depraved.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.713
-* Dead end *
-* Why we should be

04:05.746 --> 04:08.282
-* On dead end street
-* Dead end *

04:08.316 --> 04:10.217
* People are living
on dead end street *

04:10.250 --> 04:11.785
* Dead end *

04:11.819 --> 04:14.755
* I'm gonna die
on dead end street *

04:14.788 --> 04:16.290
* Dead end street

04:16.324 --> 04:17.725
-* Yeah *
-* Dead end street

04:17.758 --> 04:18.759
* Yeah *

04:18.792 --> 04:19.927
* Dead end street.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.296
Finally, I became one of
the most iniquitous men

04:22.330 --> 04:25.766
that ever blew a wrapper off
a straw: door-to-door salesmen.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.768
Now, here's how I move
these Karpet Kings.

04:27.801 --> 04:31.739
I make my pitch, then I start
crying, bawling like a baby.

04:31.772 --> 04:35.409
The trick is I'm secretly
clinically depressed.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.077
-(both laugh)
-Haven't thought of that.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.279
Not bad.

04:39.313 --> 04:41.349
Slices of pie all around, Mabel!

04:42.215 --> 04:43.684
So, rookie, your first day.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.286
What do they have you pushing,
water beds?

04:46.320 --> 04:48.088
Well, I am reaching
for the stars

04:48.121 --> 04:50.691
with Vertebreaker trampolines!

04:50.724 --> 04:52.626
(laughter)

04:52.660 --> 04:55.629
-What's so funny?
-They got you slingin' springs!

04:55.663 --> 04:57.297
The kid's a hop jockey.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.699
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.602
I know someone who sold
two of those tot tossers.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.104
In his whole career! (laughs)

05:04.137 --> 05:06.139
(laughter)

05:06.173 --> 05:08.642
FLANDERS: What those
door-to-door ding-dongs

05:08.676 --> 05:11.111
didn't count on was a little
extracurricular activity

05:11.144 --> 05:12.880
during Apollo 14.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.282
-(radio static crackling)
-ASTRONAUT: Whee!

05:15.315 --> 05:16.884
Over.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.552
Whee! Over.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.554
FLANDERS:
America caught bounce fever.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.556
Trampolines were just
what people were looking for

05:22.590 --> 05:26.326
to forget the long quagmire
that was Gunsmoke.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.529
*

05:34.668 --> 05:36.970
Before I knew it,
I was the king of springs.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.007
But after spring
comes the fall.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.543
Mabel! A slice of pie
for all my friends!

05:42.576 --> 05:44.645
Better yet, leave the tin.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.380
-Well!
-Well, how about that!

05:46.414 --> 05:48.215
Big man, are ya? Real big man.

05:48.248 --> 05:50.818
Well, big man,
I got a headline for ya.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.721
They just found out
those things are a death trap.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.523
Oh, sure, there's broken bones,
concussions,

05:55.556 --> 05:57.725
the occasional kid who goes up
and never comes down,

05:57.758 --> 05:59.760
but I wouldn't call them
a death trap.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.095
I mean electrocution, smart guy.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.398
Those little angel makers
you've been slingin'

06:04.432 --> 06:07.334
generate static electricity
with every bounce.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.671
The mats are made of birthday
balloon rubber and cat hair.

06:10.704 --> 06:14.842
If you get to 500 bounces,
zappo! French-fried kid.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.277
(gasps) I've put
innocent lives in danger.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.947
And my sales pitch strongly
implied that wouldn't happen.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.615
Eh, that's the game we're in.

06:21.649 --> 06:25.619
If you don't like death,
get out of children's toys.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.790
FLANDERS:
I've got to stop him!

06:29.823 --> 06:32.793
401... 402...

06:32.826 --> 06:34.895
-(camera clicking)
-Wow! I knew he could bounce,

06:34.928 --> 06:37.264
but I had no idea
he could count.

06:38.899 --> 06:42.803
YOUNG HOMER (over radio):
412... 413...

06:42.836 --> 06:44.605
Oh, the brake pedal
won't go down!

06:44.638 --> 06:48.509
Why did I get these
super shag floor mats? Why?!

06:50.744 --> 06:52.813
(groans)

06:52.846 --> 06:54.948
-495...
-(electricity crackling)

06:54.982 --> 06:58.051
496...

06:58.085 --> 07:00.921
497... 498...

07:00.954 --> 07:05.493
(slow, distorted):
499...

07:05.526 --> 07:07.160
(gasps)

07:11.665 --> 07:13.634
(electricity crackling)

07:19.272 --> 07:20.641
-(thunder rumbling)
-(groaning)

07:20.674 --> 07:22.810
(groans)

07:22.843 --> 07:25.012
-Jesus.
-'Sup?

07:25.045 --> 07:26.814
Lord? Why am I here?

07:26.847 --> 07:28.749
Uh, Ned Flanders,
you have been a sinner,

07:28.782 --> 07:31.084
but you have taken the first
step on the road to redemption,

07:31.118 --> 07:33.353
and if you accept the word
of the Lord-- that's me--

07:33.386 --> 07:35.923
I shall return you to Earth
to carry forth my word of hope.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.457
And, uh, like that.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.693
Jimi Hendrix is here
for your guitar lesson.

07:39.727 --> 07:42.462
Hey, man. You been practicing
what I told you?

07:42.496 --> 07:44.498
Uh, yeah, uh, I meant to,

07:44.532 --> 07:47.467
but, uh, I lost the pick
in the hole.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.469
-Of the guitar?
-Oh. I wish.

07:51.204 --> 07:53.774
I don't care, baby.
Jimi gets paid either way.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.043
(electric guitar riff plays)

07:56.076 --> 07:58.612
(Flanders groans)

07:58.646 --> 08:00.648
Praise the Lord, I am reborn!

08:00.681 --> 08:02.049
(others gasp)

08:02.082 --> 08:04.217
It's a miracle!
He recovered without help!

08:04.251 --> 08:06.620
In retrospect,
I should have tried CPR.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.221
Well, I'm a believer.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.559
Come on, fellas,
let's go spread the good word.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.894
God is alive!

08:13.927 --> 08:15.963
Anyone need a vacuum?

08:15.996 --> 08:17.965
FLANDERS:
God gave me a second chance,

08:17.998 --> 08:20.668
and as a sign of his mercy,
he permanently scarred

08:20.701 --> 08:22.803
my beautiful,
beautiful philtrum.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.805
KIDS:
Whoa!

08:24.838 --> 08:28.041
And that's why I'm wearing
this mustache till I'm just ash.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.177
It wasn't till God
seriously deformed me

08:30.210 --> 08:32.713
that I fully understood
his love.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.649
GOD: So, Ned Flanders
gets into Heaven.

08:35.683 --> 08:38.385
It'll be interesting to see
which wife he goes with.

08:38.418 --> 08:40.253
GOD: Eh, either way,
it'll be tough sledding.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.694
Well, you know, Lord,
if you want more people here,

08:46.727 --> 08:48.028
there's a category
you're not considering.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.830
GOD: People who bring
their dogs on planes

08:49.863 --> 08:51.732
and say they're therapy pets?

08:51.765 --> 08:53.266
I can hear you.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.403
Oh, and nice to meet you,
finally.

08:56.436 --> 08:58.405
So, you made me in your image.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.908
(chuckles): Well, it's like
looking in a mirror.

09:00.941 --> 09:03.076
-Not!
-Who did that?

09:03.110 --> 09:06.446
-It wasn't me.
-Oh, you traitor!

09:06.479 --> 09:08.582
Actually,
I'm talking about people

09:08.616 --> 09:11.084
who don't believe in God
but are still righteous.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.086
I'm talking about
atheists, Lord.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.554
Atheists?

09:14.588 --> 09:16.790
(scoffs)
I refuse to believe they exist.

09:16.824 --> 09:20.060
Well, they do. Maybe they
deserve a place here, too.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.963
I'd like to talk about someone
who should be in Heaven:

09:22.996 --> 09:24.564
my grandmother.

09:24.598 --> 09:27.801
My grandmother's 36, and she's
got eight grandchildren.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.402
Strong woman.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.639
My grandmother was an atheist.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.907
(gasps) I'll just flip this.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.044
Her name was Genevieve.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.312
She lived in occupied France

09:39.346 --> 09:41.782
in the darkest days
of World War Two.

09:41.815 --> 09:44.918
And she no longer
believed in God.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.921
* He's in the afterlife,
punishing heavily *

09:47.955 --> 09:51.058
* He's the boogie woogie
Christian God of John 3:16 *

09:51.091 --> 09:53.593
* A root, a toot,
just don't eat his fruit *

09:53.627 --> 09:55.663
* He was born in a barn

09:55.696 --> 09:57.631
* He loved religion.

09:57.665 --> 10:01.234
(French accent): How could a god
allow this awful war to happen?

10:01.268 --> 10:03.671
GOD: I stopped a thousand wars
that would've been worse.

10:03.704 --> 10:06.173
Nobody ever talks about that.

10:06.206 --> 10:10.610
MARGE: Perhaps her mélancolie
came from her marriage

10:10.644 --> 10:15.182
to the village's most notorious
Nazi collaborator.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.817
Bonjour, bonjour, Commandant!

10:16.850 --> 10:20.788
And may I say, you put the "ja"
in "jawohl!" (chuckles)

10:20.821 --> 10:23.256
Ah, my dear wife.
I'm just here collaborating,

10:23.290 --> 10:24.925
mixing in a little treason.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.694
You know, stuff
that'll look really bad

10:26.727 --> 10:28.662
in a documentary if we lose.

10:28.696 --> 10:31.932
Now, with business booming, you
can no longer deny your husband

10:31.965 --> 10:35.135
the sweet fruits of marriage.
(chuckles)

10:35.168 --> 10:37.137
Mmm, oh, yeah, yeah.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.806
I'm hooked. Mmm.

10:38.839 --> 10:42.375
Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh, yeah.

10:42.409 --> 10:46.446
Kissing with your eyes closed
never goes awry. Ever.

10:46.479 --> 10:50.718
Why did I marry the model
for the town gargoyle? Ugh!

10:52.753 --> 10:55.288
-(gasping)
-MAN: Quiet.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.725
Qui est là? Qui! Qui!

10:57.758 --> 11:00.027
We're U.S. paratroops.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.695
We've been roaming
the countryside

11:01.729 --> 11:03.731
disguised as French farmers.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.333
You must leave now.
My husband is a collaborator.

11:06.366 --> 11:07.634
Well, I've got a screenplay

11:07.667 --> 11:09.737
I've been looking for
someone to help me write.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.071
Not that kind.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.540
If he just gets something
on the page, that's progress.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.342
(door opens,
footsteps descending stairs)

11:15.375 --> 11:16.810
Germans.

11:16.844 --> 11:19.713
We're cooked. Worse than
the Cubs in the '32 Series.

11:19.747 --> 11:22.883
I'm not a sports guy.
Do you have an art metaphor?

11:22.916 --> 11:25.252
We'll be chopped up
worse than a Picasso nude!

11:25.285 --> 11:27.955
Now my alarm is palpable!

11:29.757 --> 11:32.159
What are you gonna do,
help us or turn us in?

11:32.192 --> 11:36.329
Because I don't believe
there is a God above,

11:36.363 --> 11:39.733
we must make our own Heaven
down below.

11:39.767 --> 11:40.768
SOLDIERS:
Ah!

11:41.902 --> 11:43.603
Hurry now!

11:43.636 --> 11:46.206
-Do we get tips?
-Not in Europe.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.641
Damn it. Now I know
what we're fighting for.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.914
Quoi?!

11:53.947 --> 11:57.250
(French accent):
Ooh-la-la! Dinner is served.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.852
(German accent):
What an odd accent.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.420
Are you really French?

12:00.453 --> 12:02.089
(normal voice):
Stinking customers!

12:02.122 --> 12:04.191
You can't ask me
personal questions.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.759
(spits dramatically)

12:05.793 --> 12:07.795
Ah, you are French.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.772
(groans) American fool.
They'll see right through you.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.640
You don't know the first thing

12:20.673 --> 12:22.409
about world-class
dinner service.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.978
Now listen here. I know
we may not look like much,

12:25.012 --> 12:27.580
but when a fish knife
needs to be placed just so,

12:27.614 --> 12:29.082
they're the mugs you want.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.151
I am your, um, uh...

12:31.184 --> 12:33.653
How do you say "sommelier"
in French?

12:33.686 --> 12:35.222
(phone ringing)

12:35.255 --> 12:36.957
Café Meaux. Meaux speaking.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.226
BART (French accent): I'd like
to speak to Monsieur Pants,

12:39.259 --> 12:41.294
-first name Pierre.
-Un moment.

12:41.328 --> 12:44.597
Pierre Pants? Pierre Pants?!

12:44.631 --> 12:47.734
Oh, come on, anyone
in this joint Pee Your Pants?

12:47.767 --> 12:49.636
(laughter)

12:49.669 --> 12:51.771
-Heil humor!
-(laughs)

12:51.805 --> 12:53.673
Laughing is for Germans only.

12:53.706 --> 12:54.975
Ow!

12:55.008 --> 12:59.012
Now, precisely what part
of France are you from?

12:59.046 --> 13:00.747
Eh... Normandy beach.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.349
You know,
where the invasion's coming.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.785
(gasps)
We must warn our Panzers!

13:05.819 --> 13:08.488
We got to stop 'em, but how?

13:08.521 --> 13:12.725
Don't ask me. I believe
in nothing, except my country.

13:13.894 --> 13:18.866
* Allons enfants
de la patrie *

13:18.899 --> 13:23.503
* Le jour de gloire est arrivé

13:23.536 --> 13:26.773
* Contre nous de la tyrannie

13:26.806 --> 13:30.643
* L'étendard sanglant est levé

13:30.677 --> 13:34.814
* Ils viennent
jusque dans nos bras *

13:34.848 --> 13:39.887
* Egorger nos fils,
nos compagnes... *

13:39.920 --> 13:41.821
Come with me, fraulein,

13:41.855 --> 13:44.557
and everything will be
Nietzsche keen.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.326
(crowd gasps)

13:47.727 --> 13:49.696
You can drink our beer,
you can take our gold,

13:49.729 --> 13:51.231
you can take my wife.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.832
No, you can't!

13:54.667 --> 13:56.703
Oh. Well,
the marriage counselor said

13:56.736 --> 13:59.206
we should try to find
a common interest, so, uh...

14:00.740 --> 14:06.679
* Non, rien de rien

14:06.713 --> 14:12.152
* Non, je ne regrette rien

14:12.185 --> 14:14.354
* Ni le bien.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.656
(men scream)

14:16.689 --> 14:19.927
Oh, Meaux, I am so sorry
I ever made you kiss a fish.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.661
That was a fish?

14:21.694 --> 14:23.030
But this isn't.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.665
Mmm.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.667
There's more in the bedroom.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.036
We have a bedroom?

14:29.069 --> 14:32.372
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

14:32.405 --> 14:36.409
So, it goes to show atheists
can do great things, too.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.411
GOD:
All right, I agree.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.714
We will open Heaven
to the deserving atheists.

14:41.748 --> 14:44.384
And if you let them in,
there are a few mistakes

14:44.417 --> 14:46.053
I'd recommend getting rid of.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.854
Christopher Columbus.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.457
(Italian accent): Hey, what are
you two talking about?

14:50.490 --> 14:52.192
Nothing.
What are you doing here?

14:52.225 --> 14:55.028
I was looking for a quicker
route to the bathroom,

14:55.062 --> 14:56.663
and I got lost.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.270
-GOD: Oh, it's him.
-Hey, dudes.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.038
Who wants to rub my belly?

15:05.072 --> 15:07.240
(God and Saint Peter groan)

15:07.274 --> 15:09.977
Now, why don't you consider
other faiths for your Heaven?

15:10.010 --> 15:12.712
Like, oh-- I don't know--
the way of the Buddha?

15:12.745 --> 15:16.049
I say no shirt, no shoes,
no salvation.

15:16.083 --> 15:19.119
I say we have Lisa Simpson.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.788
Well, there is redemption,
and there are good works.

15:21.821 --> 15:23.723
But there is another path.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.627
A path to enlightenment
without ego or possessions.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.596
I don't know.
Jesus is pretty fond

15:29.629 --> 15:32.065
of that plus sign
he's always carrying around.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.001
Let me share
the Buddhist path to Heaven

15:34.034 --> 15:36.003
with an enlightened tale I call

15:36.036 --> 15:38.738
"The Princess
Not Affiliated With Disney."

15:38.771 --> 15:40.840
Unless we are now owned
by Disney.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.909
In the sixth century B.C.,

15:42.942 --> 15:44.911
or zero
in the Buddhist calendar...

15:44.944 --> 15:47.414
FLANDERS:
Oh, you have your own calendar.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.449
What's today,
the fifth of Bibbity-boo?

15:49.482 --> 15:52.519
LISA: ...zero
in the Buddhist calendar,

15:52.552 --> 15:55.822
lived the spoiled
Princess Siddmartha.

15:55.855 --> 15:59.292
Siddmartha, sweetie,
look what we got you.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.494
Oh. A pony.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.196
-50 ponies!
-(pony neighs)

16:03.230 --> 16:05.698
Oh. Somehow 50 ponies

16:05.732 --> 16:08.335
-seem less than one.
-Oh.

16:08.368 --> 16:11.304
LISA: The princess wondered,
if nothing was denied her,

16:11.338 --> 16:13.340
-why was she not satisfied?
-(King Homer screams)

16:13.373 --> 16:15.708
Why couldn't she be happy
like her brother

16:15.742 --> 16:18.711
with his stupid
multiplayer games?

16:18.745 --> 16:20.747
(dramatic music playing)

16:22.015 --> 16:23.650
(elephant trumpeting)

16:25.752 --> 16:28.721
-(gong rings)
-(victorious fanfare plays)

16:28.755 --> 16:31.724
Brother, do you not grow weary
of this opulence?

16:31.758 --> 16:33.693
Sometimes, but there's always
the decadence.

16:33.726 --> 16:38.331
There must be a middle path
between opulence and decadence.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.367
-Flatulence?
-(Milhouse laughs)

16:40.400 --> 16:41.701
No.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.736
(elephants trumpeting)

16:46.173 --> 16:49.142
Please, somebody,
think of the elephants!

16:49.176 --> 16:51.578
Princess Siddmartha, hmm,

16:51.611 --> 16:54.814
perhaps the stars hold
the answer to your questions.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.350
Why don't you take a look?

16:58.385 --> 17:00.353
(choir sings)

17:00.387 --> 17:01.854
SIDDMARTHA:
Meh.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.724
(kids laughing, chattering)

17:04.757 --> 17:08.027
Those children have nothing,
but they're enjoying themselves.

17:08.061 --> 17:10.397
Maybe all these riches
have blinded me

17:10.430 --> 17:12.399
to what really matters:

17:12.432 --> 17:14.434
goats' heads. Hmm.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.170
(snoring)

17:17.204 --> 17:18.771
That's mine.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.441
(snoring)

17:26.646 --> 17:31.684
* I live a life
of great excess *

17:31.718 --> 17:36.389
* And yet I find no happiness

17:36.423 --> 17:41.228
* There's more to life
than this, I hope *

17:41.261 --> 17:44.063
* Than golden tubs
and fragrant soap *

17:44.097 --> 17:46.866
* All kinds of stuff,
and yet I mope *

17:46.899 --> 17:51.638
* I want less

17:51.671 --> 17:53.640
* Don't want to grab life
by the horns *

17:53.673 --> 17:57.210
* Don't want
to grab that brass ring *

17:57.244 --> 17:59.746
* Hear me shout
and hear me sing *

17:59.779 --> 18:02.749
* All I want is just one thing

18:02.782 --> 18:07.754
* I want less, I want less

18:07.787 --> 18:10.723
* Less, less, less

18:10.757 --> 18:15.762
* I want more of

18:15.795 --> 18:21.301
* Less...

18:21.334 --> 18:23.270
Less.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.804
Oops.

18:24.837 --> 18:29.276
LISA: Disguised as a poor boy,
Siddmartha sought out

18:29.309 --> 18:31.278
the most learned scholars
in the kingdom.

18:31.311 --> 18:32.745
But she soon learned

18:32.779 --> 18:35.748
Kathmandu U,
like Budhanilkantha Tech,

18:35.782 --> 18:37.650
was just another party school.

18:37.684 --> 18:40.019
(laughter, cheering)

18:40.052 --> 18:42.489
Excuse me. (clears throat)

18:42.522 --> 18:44.957
(deep voice):
You're wasting your lives, man.

18:44.991 --> 18:48.528
It's the year zero.
How much is there to learn?

18:48.561 --> 18:51.664
Come on, girl.
Let's find inner peace.

18:51.698 --> 18:52.699
(neighs)

18:58.805 --> 19:03.543
I will sit under this Bodhi Tree
because I am void of ideas.

19:03.576 --> 19:08.448
LISA: So, Siddmartha sat
and sat and sat and sat,

19:08.481 --> 19:10.617
willing to wait
forever and a day

19:10.650 --> 19:12.385
until she found enlightenment.

19:12.419 --> 19:14.421
*

19:32.672 --> 19:34.674
* Om...

19:37.244 --> 19:39.712
* Om...

19:39.746 --> 19:42.215
-Namaste!
-(kids cheering)

19:42.249 --> 19:46.253
Even though she strayed from
our faith, I'm proud of Lisa.

19:47.754 --> 19:50.590
That Buddhist kid's
a really good person.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.525
What? I'm just sayin'.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.093
GOD:
Mm, if we've learned anything

19:54.126 --> 19:56.329
from these three
tangentially-related stories,

19:56.363 --> 19:58.598
it's that there are many paths
to Heaven.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.833
Maybe we should let
everybody in.

20:00.867 --> 20:04.837
Great idea. I decree that all
with good souls are welcome

20:04.871 --> 20:07.774
in Heaven now and forever.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.276
(thunderclap)

20:09.309 --> 20:10.677
How did I get here?

20:10.710 --> 20:13.012
Well, you see,
you were Smithers' plus one.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.748
I demand to get in
on my own merits.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.850
(sighs) I'll talk to him.

20:17.884 --> 20:21.254
CHOIR: * Hallelujah,
hallelujah, hallelujah. *

20:25.625 --> 20:27.560
-(thunder rumbles)
-(boys whimper)

20:27.594 --> 20:29.095
Don't be scared, boys.

20:29.128 --> 20:31.130
That's just angels bowling.
(chuckles)

20:33.266 --> 20:35.134
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

20:35.167 --> 20:38.438
-Oh, we consider it a blessing.
-GOD: Kiss-up.

20:50.483 --> 20:54.487

Media Access Group at WGBH

21:24.717 --> 21:26.519
Shh!
