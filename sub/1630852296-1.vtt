00:04.004 --> 00:06.789
- The auto industry
is changing.

00:06.832 --> 00:09.487
Payne Motors has been
making cars for 100 years,

00:09.531 --> 00:12.055
but until now,
all our CEOs have been men

00:12.099 --> 00:13.839
and members
of the Payne family.

00:13.883 --> 00:15.145
- Well, I didn't want the job.

00:15.189 --> 00:16.364
- They didn't offer
you the job.

00:16.407 --> 00:17.495
- Because they knew
I didn't want it.

00:17.539 --> 00:20.107
- Anyway, today we are--
- You can sit.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.543
I don't need, like,
a whole big intro.

00:21.586 --> 00:23.023
- I just had a little bit--
-

00:23.066 --> 00:24.415
I just wanna
keep things moving.

00:24.459 --> 00:27.157
All right,
so someone bring me up to speed

00:27.201 --> 00:29.029
on this self-driving car
that we are announcing.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.813
- Yes.

00:30.856 --> 00:33.859
The Ponderosa will be Payne's
first fully autonomous vehicle.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.165
It has seven key innovations--

00:35.209 --> 00:36.688
- I don't wanna
interrupt your flow.

00:36.732 --> 00:39.213
I just have one question,
the name Ponderosa,

00:39.256 --> 00:42.259
do we like it?

00:42.303 --> 00:44.827
- It tested well.
- Really?

00:44.870 --> 00:48.004
Yeah, to me, it sounds like
ponderous, like dull,

00:48.048 --> 00:50.398
you know,
like a dull, ponderous car.

00:50.441 --> 00:52.400
- It comes from
the Ponderosa pine tree.

00:52.443 --> 00:53.749
- Do people wanna drive a tree?

00:53.792 --> 00:55.490
- We're not saying
that it is a tree.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.405
It's just, like, a vibe.
- Yeah.

00:57.448 --> 01:00.538
There's also the Ponderosa
lemon and the Ponderosa snails.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.149
- But aren't snails like
the slowest animal,

01:02.192 --> 01:03.846
and also a lemon?

01:03.889 --> 01:05.717
I mean, isn't that what people
call a car that sucks?

01:05.761 --> 01:07.067
Sounds like we're saying

01:07.110 --> 01:10.331
it's like a dull,
slow, bad tree-car.

01:10.374 --> 01:12.028
- Yeah, you know, I've gotta
say, I agree with you.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.073
You know,
I think the name's crap.

01:13.116 --> 01:14.509
- Do you?
- Yes, I do.

01:14.552 --> 01:15.988
I've always thought that.
- Have you?

01:16.032 --> 01:17.860
- Yes.
- To me, it sounds dirty.

01:17.903 --> 01:19.470
Like, pon sounds like poon,

01:19.514 --> 01:22.647
which means vagina,
and de rosa means "of pink."

01:22.691 --> 01:25.389
So I just picture a giant pink
vagina on wheels.

01:25.433 --> 01:27.217
- That's probably why
it tested so well.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.436
- The name isn't important.

01:28.479 --> 01:30.525
We've made advancements
in sensor fusion

01:30.568 --> 01:32.440
and scene recognition
that will revolutionize--

01:32.483 --> 01:35.138
- Wasn't there a car that meant
something bad in Spanish?

01:35.182 --> 01:36.705
- Yeah.
Quite a few of them actually.

01:36.748 --> 01:39.055
There's the Chevy Nova,
the Mazda Laputa,

01:39.099 --> 01:40.665
the Mitsubishi Pajero.

01:40.709 --> 01:42.232
- You'd think these companies
would hire at least one guy

01:42.276 --> 01:44.452
who spoke Spanish.

01:44.495 --> 01:47.150
- Does anyone here
speak Spanish?

01:49.283 --> 01:50.762
- Jesus, people.

01:50.806 --> 01:53.635
[upbeat music]

01:53.678 --> 01:58.727
â™ª

01:58.770 --> 02:02.034
- My great-grandfather would be
rolling over in his grave

02:02.078 --> 02:04.428
if he saw that woman running
the company that he founded.

02:04.472 --> 02:05.560
- Oh, because he hated women?

02:05.603 --> 02:06.865
- I thought he
hated communists.

02:06.909 --> 02:08.737
- No, I think it was Irishmen.
- No.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.608
It's because she knows nothing
about the auto industry.

02:10.652 --> 02:12.175
- She did pretty well
with that drug company.

02:12.219 --> 02:14.308
- Exactly.
She's literally a drug dealer.

02:14.351 --> 02:15.613
I wouldn't let my drug dealer

02:15.657 --> 02:17.485
run a billion-dollar
corporation.

02:17.528 --> 02:20.618
Actually, with him, I might.
He's like low-key genius.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.620
- I just never worked
for a woman before.

02:22.664 --> 02:24.187
You know, with a man,
if I make a mistake,

02:24.231 --> 02:25.449
I can flirt a little,

02:25.493 --> 02:27.625
but you cannot flirt
with a woman.

02:27.669 --> 02:29.758
Well, I guess you can,
technically.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.803
We're about 95% sure
about my cousin.

02:31.847 --> 02:34.284
- Hello.
- She just bought two ladders.

02:34.328 --> 02:35.807
- You'll be fine, all right?

02:35.851 --> 02:37.200
If anyone's gonna be fired,
it's probably gonna be me.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.375
- Or me.
- Yeah.

02:38.419 --> 02:39.507
Actually, I really hope
it is you.

02:39.550 --> 02:40.943
- I can totally see it
being you, dude.

02:40.986 --> 02:42.292
- Now that you said it
out loud, I was thinking it.

02:42.336 --> 02:43.989
- And another feature
of the Payne Ponderosa

02:44.033 --> 02:47.254
is it's--how do you say this?
Chassis, chass-ees?

02:47.297 --> 02:50.822
- Chass-y.
- Chass-y, oh, like gassy.

02:50.866 --> 02:53.216
I was feeling very gassy
when I got on my chassy.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.870
Chassy.
- Perfect.

02:54.913 --> 02:57.220
And then
before you introduce the car,

02:57.264 --> 02:58.656
I thought you might wanna
say a few words

02:58.700 --> 03:00.963
about what made you excited
to come to Payne?

03:01.006 --> 03:03.661
- Oh, I can do that
in two words, the money.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.881
I mean, obviously,
it wasn't just the money.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.578
There were stock options.

03:07.622 --> 03:09.319
- Right, well,
maybe just more what you love

03:09.363 --> 03:11.321
about cars then in general.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.671
- Honestly, I'm not
really that into cars.

03:13.715 --> 03:15.412
I mean, if anything,
I think is kind of weird

03:15.456 --> 03:17.762
how some people
fetishize transportation.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.286
- Right.

03:19.329 --> 03:21.026
Well, that could be a challenge
leading a car company.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.854
- I actually think it's better

03:22.898 --> 03:24.856
if you're not that
into what you're selling.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.511
It's, like, if you're really
into heroin, don't sell heroin.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.557
Go into a different field,
you know?

03:29.600 --> 03:31.776
Why, are you like some kind
of crazy car person?

03:31.820 --> 03:33.387
- Me?
Oh, no, not really.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.258
I mean, define car person,
right?

03:35.302 --> 03:37.521
Do I appreciate cars?
Sure.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.480
Do I love them?
I mean, define love.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.743
Define cars for that matter.

03:43.832 --> 03:47.183
Anyways, so the analysts,
they get here at 5:00.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.098
So if you want--
- Who's that guy?

03:49.141 --> 03:50.360
- I don't know.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.536
It's some worker.
He looks lost.

03:52.580 --> 03:53.450
- Seems like he needs
to talk to you.

03:53.494 --> 03:54.669
- Does he?
- Mm-hmm.

03:54.712 --> 03:58.847
- That's weird.
Okay, now I'll go--okay.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.501
Go see whoever
the heck that is.

04:00.544 --> 04:03.330
And we'll continue this
on the B side, Katherine.

04:03.373 --> 04:05.636
- Grassy Shirley Bassey
got on her chassy.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.377
- What are you doing here?

04:07.421 --> 04:08.726
- Oh, I just needed
to talk to you.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.162
Do you know I've never been up
to this level--

04:10.206 --> 04:11.381
- Just--haven't you--
- This place is really nice.

04:11.425 --> 04:13.253
- Yes, please get in.

04:14.471 --> 04:16.081
Look, I am sorry.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.301
Last week, that was fun,
but it was a mistake.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.912
- Oh, you told me.
- We have this new boss.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.740
And it would look really bad
for me

04:22.784 --> 04:24.220
to be involved
with a guy from the factory.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.656
Sorry, not the factory.
Just anyone who works here.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.049
- Are you trying
to have me transferred

04:27.092 --> 04:28.180
to the truck plant in Westland?

04:28.224 --> 04:29.617
- Hm?
- Yeah.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.096
I thought maybe you felt weird
about having me around

04:31.140 --> 04:33.751
after--well, you know,
and you want to get rid of me.

04:33.795 --> 04:37.842
- No, that was not me.
- Are you sure?

04:37.886 --> 04:40.410
Because my supervisor
said it was you.

04:40.454 --> 04:42.194
- Oh, Westland?
- Westland.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.587
- Westland?
- Westland.

04:43.631 --> 04:44.588
- Yes, no, what happened was

04:44.632 --> 04:46.329
that we got this call asking

04:46.373 --> 04:48.288
for a new day shift operator
in the Westland,

04:48.331 --> 04:49.332
and I heard you're the best.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.639
- Really?
Who do you hear that from?

04:51.682 --> 04:53.380
- Lots of people.
- Was one of them Shawn?

04:53.423 --> 04:55.425
- Yes, Shawn.
- Yes.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.079
- He loves you.
- Okay, which Shawn was it?

04:57.122 --> 04:59.211
- I do not know his last name--

04:59.255 --> 05:01.431
- 'Cause we don't have
a single Shawn that works here.

05:01.475 --> 05:03.564
- I find that hard to believe.

05:04.173 --> 05:06.741
- In a way, being the CEO would
have been the easy way out.

05:06.784 --> 05:09.091
I'm able to be more effective
as a consultant.

05:09.134 --> 05:10.397
- Mm-hmm.
- Dori.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.312
If anyone calls,
I'll be down at the test track.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.617
- Okay.

05:13.661 --> 05:14.966
- And can you handle
whatever A/V stuff we need

05:15.010 --> 05:16.316
for the presentation
this afternoon?

05:16.359 --> 05:17.534
- Me?

05:17.578 --> 05:18.796
The most technology I know

05:18.840 --> 05:21.364
how to use is my hair curler
and my vibrator.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.888
Right?

05:23.932 --> 05:27.849
Mm, but I will figure it out
because I'm a professional.

05:27.892 --> 05:31.026
- Great.
- Great.

05:31.069 --> 05:33.985
- Great?
Oh, my God.

05:34.029 --> 05:37.162
If I was CEO,
I would have said "Make it so."

05:37.206 --> 05:38.860
She's so generic.

05:38.903 --> 05:41.558
It's, like,
super embarrassing.

05:41.602 --> 05:42.820
â™ª

05:42.864 --> 05:44.300
- So does this self-driving car

05:44.344 --> 05:46.084
actually drive anywhere?

05:46.128 --> 05:49.000
- How do I put this in drive?
- It's voice-controlled.

05:49.044 --> 05:52.221
Oh, baby, drive us
around the block.

05:53.178 --> 05:56.051
- You're calling it "baby"?
Seems a bit misogynistic.

05:56.094 --> 05:57.182
- How is that misogynistic?

05:57.226 --> 05:58.793
- 'Cause you can't
call women "baby."

05:58.836 --> 06:00.490
- But it's not a woman.
It's a car.

06:00.534 --> 06:01.970
- All cars are women.
Everyone knows that.

06:02.013 --> 06:03.928
Like, "She's a beauty.
Let's take her for a spin."

06:03.972 --> 06:05.713
- Well, this car
is a man, okay?

06:05.756 --> 06:07.932
- Figures,
first car to do the driving,

06:07.976 --> 06:09.064
and it's a man.

06:10.413 --> 06:12.720
- Oh, Cyrus,
where is the break?

06:12.763 --> 06:14.112
- Don't need one.
Watch.

06:17.725 --> 06:19.988
- That's kinda neat.
It's like a Roomba.

06:20.031 --> 06:22.686
- Well, not unless your Roomba
can create a 3D map of the road

06:22.730 --> 06:26.342
and then uses machine learning
algorithms to identify...

06:26.386 --> 06:30.433
but yeah, essentially,
it's just like a big Roomba.

06:30.477 --> 06:31.956
- Yeah, it's like a Roomba.

06:34.785 --> 06:36.874
- See our new overlord?

06:36.918 --> 06:38.485
Katherine?

06:38.528 --> 06:41.183
Sounds like someone
who uses a catheter.

06:41.226 --> 06:43.011
- Sick burn, man.
- Thanks.

06:43.054 --> 06:44.882
Hey, if there's
a power struggle,

06:44.926 --> 06:46.231
factory's Team Wesley, right?

06:46.275 --> 06:48.973
- You know, most of us
just punch in and out,

06:49.017 --> 06:50.453
don't get involved
in that type of thing.

06:50.497 --> 06:53.891
- Got it, neutral.
Respect.

06:53.935 --> 06:56.372
But I'm telling you, man,
Ewell Payne would not have

06:56.416 --> 06:58.200
wanted that woman
running his company.

06:58.896 --> 07:01.029
- Why?
Is she Jewish or something?

07:01.072 --> 07:02.552
- Ugh, God.

07:04.119 --> 07:06.382
- Cyrus, there's someone--
- Don't worry, we'll stop.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.731
Just as soon as we--
- Stop it.

07:07.775 --> 07:08.993
- It'll stop.
- Stop it.

07:09.037 --> 07:10.386
- There's no break!
- Baby, stop!

07:10.430 --> 07:12.214
- Ahh!

07:12.257 --> 07:13.824
Ahh!

07:16.653 --> 07:17.872
- Now, let me put it
under your elbow.

07:17.915 --> 07:18.786
It helps with pain.
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.048
They didn't hit me that hard.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.005
- We think we know
what caused the accident.

07:21.049 --> 07:22.616
- Alleged accident.
- Right.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.400
I may have coincidentally
fallen totally on my own.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.532
- Could be.
- Okay.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.098
Well, you know how I was saying

07:27.142 --> 07:29.492
that the car identifies objects
using machine learning?

07:29.536 --> 07:31.494
Well, the operative word is--

07:31.538 --> 07:33.191
- Machine.
- Learning.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.498
See, it still confuses
with dark tones with shadows.

07:35.542 --> 07:40.155
So occasionally, certain darker
optics come off as not there.

07:40.198 --> 07:42.200
- And by darker objects,
do you mean--

07:42.244 --> 07:43.985
- Like a black cat,

07:44.028 --> 07:48.685
or a dark blue car,
or darker brown skin.

07:51.688 --> 07:53.603
- So you've made a car
that hits Black people?

07:53.647 --> 07:57.085
- No, no, no.
Not intentionally.

07:57.128 --> 07:58.739
- Oh!
- Be your own people.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.218
- What would Ewell Payne
have said if he saw

08:00.262 --> 08:02.177
that we designed
the world's first racist car?

08:02.220 --> 08:05.093
- "Well done," probably.
- The car's not racist.

08:05.136 --> 08:07.661
Race is about a shared culture,
history, and traditions.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.445
This just doesn't
see darker skin.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.316
It hit Indian folk, too.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.622
- Oh, thank God.

08:12.666 --> 08:13.710
I thought for a moment
that we built a car

08:13.754 --> 08:15.190
that wouldn't
hit Indian people.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.844
- How are you just
figuring this out now?

08:16.887 --> 08:18.236
In the pharmaceutical industry,

08:18.280 --> 08:19.977
we would test a product
before we announced it.

08:20.021 --> 08:22.110
- Didn't stop all those babies
from being born without heads.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.328
- They had heads.

08:23.372 --> 08:24.765
They just weren't attached
to their bodies.

08:24.808 --> 08:26.027
- We tested it, but
the cardboard cutout thingies

08:26.070 --> 08:27.550
we tested it on were all white.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.160
- Well, why don't we get

08:29.204 --> 08:30.684
some black cardboard cutout
thingies, you know, inclusion?

08:30.727 --> 08:32.947
- Thank you for being an ally.
- His words.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.514
- Y'all know what this is,
right?

08:34.557 --> 08:36.428
This is white privilege.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.387
When you're white,
Band-Aids look good on you.

08:38.430 --> 08:41.085
Hell, even a cheap shampoo
at the hotel works for you.

08:41.129 --> 08:42.609
Do y'all know
the automatic soap dispensers

08:42.652 --> 08:44.132
in the restrooms
don't even work for me?

08:44.175 --> 08:46.830
- Those are push-button.
- Say what now?

08:46.874 --> 08:48.005
- They're push-button.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.137
- Just go like this--
- Yeah.

08:49.180 --> 08:50.268
- And they come--okay.
- Just press it.

08:50.312 --> 08:51.574
- Well, I've been
bringing my own soap,

08:51.618 --> 08:53.184
and I actually like it.

08:53.228 --> 08:54.490
- Okay, we need to figure out
how we're gonna handle this.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.491
This presentation
is in six hours,

08:55.535 --> 08:56.884
and we can't just cancel it.

08:56.927 --> 08:58.494
- Okay, what if we
painted the car black?

08:58.538 --> 08:59.887
Optics-wise, I think

08:59.930 --> 09:02.063
a white car that hits
Black people looks worse

09:02.106 --> 09:03.717
than a black car
that hits Black people.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.240
- I think any car
that targets people

09:05.283 --> 09:07.634
based on their race
would look pretty not great.

09:07.677 --> 09:08.765
- Especially since
Black Lives Matter.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.332
- To be fair,

09:10.375 --> 09:12.073
it would have been bad
before Black Lives Matter, too.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.770
- Right, but like,
now we understand that also.

09:13.814 --> 09:15.598
- Okay, the analysts don't know

09:15.642 --> 09:16.599
that the car
is self-driving, right?

09:16.643 --> 09:18.166
That's the big reveal?

09:18.209 --> 09:19.428
Okay, so maybe we just think
of some other features.

09:19.471 --> 09:20.908
- In six hours?

09:20.951 --> 09:22.431
- I'm sure nothing will be
as innovative and exciting

09:22.474 --> 09:23.998
as your Klanmobile over there,

09:24.041 --> 09:26.478
but let's not let the perfect
be the enemy of the good.

09:26.522 --> 09:28.350
You should come.
- Me?

09:28.393 --> 09:29.743
- Him, why?
Why him?

09:29.786 --> 09:31.396
- Well, because I would
like his perspective.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.790
Plus, we just hit him
with a car in a way

09:33.834 --> 09:36.010
that might be perceived
as a hate crime.

09:36.053 --> 09:38.360
And so you're part of this now.

09:38.403 --> 09:40.667
- Good, now tell me this,
would the car also

09:40.710 --> 09:43.670
hit a white person
if they was in blackface?

09:43.713 --> 09:45.628
- Yeah, probably.
- Right on!

09:45.672 --> 09:46.934
- Lead with that, say that.

09:46.977 --> 09:48.762
- So it's not all bad.
- Silver lining.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.721
[upbeat music]

09:51.765 --> 09:54.724
- How is this my fault?
I licensed the AI.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.508
I didn't program it
from scratch.

09:56.552 --> 09:57.988
- No one's saying
it's your fault.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.642
- But sure, blame the Black guy
for systemic racism,

09:59.686 --> 10:02.123
and then ask the Black guy
to fix the systemic racism.

10:02.166 --> 10:03.646
Do you know how much
pressure that puts on me?

10:03.690 --> 10:04.691
- Is it a lot?

10:04.734 --> 10:06.257
- It is a lot.
- Yeah.

10:06.301 --> 10:09.347
- And FYI, I didn't test it
on non-white cutouts

10:09.391 --> 10:10.740
'cause we don't have
non-white cutouts.

10:10.784 --> 10:12.133
You know why?

10:12.176 --> 10:14.222
- Why?
- Because of systemic racism.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.876
- Yeah.

10:15.919 --> 10:17.660
Well, at least you're not being
forced to work on a project

10:17.704 --> 10:19.401
with a new boss
you're trying to impress

10:19.444 --> 10:22.012
and a subordinate
you just had sex with.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.841
- Hot assembly line-guy?
- Yeah.

10:24.885 --> 10:27.757
- Shut up, when?
- Greg's retirement party.

10:27.801 --> 10:30.281
I'd had a few drinks,
and he's very attractive.

10:30.325 --> 10:32.675
Katherine already thinks
I'm some car-obsessed fangirl.

10:32.719 --> 10:35.025
Now she's also gonna think I
can't keep my pants on at work.

10:35.069 --> 10:37.288
- Look, there's like 15,000
people who work here.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.377
After today,
he'll go back to the line.

10:39.421 --> 10:40.770
She's never gonna find out.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.467
- I never even flirt
with coworkers.

10:42.511 --> 10:44.165
The one time I make a mistake,

10:44.208 --> 10:45.949
and I'm stuck with it
forever like herpes.

10:45.993 --> 10:47.603
- A lot of people have herpes.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.822
It's not that big
a deal anymore.

10:48.865 --> 10:50.084
- What?
He didn't give me herpes.

10:50.127 --> 10:51.433
- Who'd you get it from then?

10:51.476 --> 10:53.087
- Okay, so what about
if we had a second horn

10:53.130 --> 10:54.305
that's like a polite horn.

10:54.349 --> 10:56.873
So the first horn is like,
"Rrrrh!"

10:56.917 --> 10:58.396
Like, "I hate you."

10:58.440 --> 11:01.443
But then the second horn is,
like, "eeh."

11:01.486 --> 11:03.793
Like, "Excuse me,
the light is green."

11:03.837 --> 11:05.055
Right?

11:05.099 --> 11:06.840
- I'm just not sure
polite horn counts

11:06.883 --> 11:08.145
as the car of the future.

11:08.189 --> 11:09.538
- Okay, well, maybe we should

11:09.581 --> 11:10.844
still write it down
so we don't forget it.

11:10.887 --> 11:12.149
- What about some sort
of safety feature?

11:12.193 --> 11:13.760
- I think you figured it out.

11:13.803 --> 11:16.327
The all-new Payne
featuring a safety feature.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.634
- All right, guys,
I think we need to step back

11:18.678 --> 11:21.942
and ask ourself
what do people like about cars?

11:21.985 --> 11:23.987
- You don't like cars?
- I mean, they're fine.

11:24.031 --> 11:25.772
Sometimes I'm in a place,
and I need to go

11:25.815 --> 11:27.512
to another place,
and cars help me do that.

11:27.556 --> 11:28.818
- What?

11:28.862 --> 11:31.038
- Cars are where form
meets function.

11:31.081 --> 11:33.214
Name one other thing
that's utilitarian

11:33.257 --> 11:35.607
while at the same time,
a fashion accessory,

11:35.651 --> 11:37.827
a status symbol,
and a work of art.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.350
- A wristwatch.

11:39.394 --> 11:40.874
- Uh-huh.
That would be another one.

11:40.917 --> 11:43.398
- Okay, for me,
a car is about freedom.

11:43.441 --> 11:45.748
Once you get in that thing,
you can go anywhere you want.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.098
- You've literally never left
Detroit in your entire life.

11:48.142 --> 11:49.752
- Now, why would I wanna
leave Detroit, Sadie?

11:49.796 --> 11:51.058
I just got Wi-Fi.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.320
- Okay,
when people are buying cars,

11:52.363 --> 11:53.582
they look at a bunch
of different factors.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.976
There's fuel economy,
safety, price, comfort--

11:56.019 --> 11:58.326
- Can I just say like
as a regular guy

11:58.369 --> 12:00.328
who didn't go
to business school

12:00.371 --> 12:02.722
or anything like that, I like
cars 'cause they're cool.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.419
That is it.
They look cool.

12:04.462 --> 12:06.116
They sound cool.
They are fun to drive.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.901
That's why
I don't get why anybody ever

12:07.944 --> 12:10.599
in their right mind would
want a self-driving car.

12:10.642 --> 12:12.514
Driving is just fun.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.909
- Well, someone's cuckoo
for car-nuts.

12:15.952 --> 12:17.954
- You like cars
as much as I do.

12:17.998 --> 12:19.390
- Not really, I don't know
why you'd say that.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.044
- Well, because you got
Ferrari bedsheets

12:21.088 --> 12:22.524
and a showerhead that's shaped
like a fuel nozzle.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.265
[all gasp]
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!

12:24.308 --> 12:25.657
- [laughs]

12:25.701 --> 12:28.095
- Now, how you know what
her showerhead looks like?

12:28.138 --> 12:30.271
- "Sexy Sadie,"
new nickname, boom!

12:30.314 --> 12:31.620
I'm the best at nicknames.
- Hey, hey.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.274
So should we get back
to the car we're supposed

12:33.317 --> 12:35.276
to have redesigned and produced
in roughly five hours?

12:35.319 --> 12:38.932
- Right, thank you.
Okay, new approach.

12:38.975 --> 12:41.064
In pharma,
let's say that the patent

12:41.108 --> 12:42.892
on your big pain pill is
about to expire.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.807
Well, constipated
people get pain, too.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.114
So you mix a little poop meds
in with your pain pill,

12:47.157 --> 12:48.463
and next thing you know,

12:48.506 --> 12:50.987
Rasputinol is making
$1.6 billion.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.684
- I used to snort Rasputinol.
- Everyone did.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.077
That's why it grossed 1.6.

12:54.121 --> 12:57.689
- So you just wanna combine
like a bunch of cars?

12:57.733 --> 12:58.995
- Well, no.

12:59.039 --> 13:00.605
I mean, not whole cars,
just the best parts.

13:00.649 --> 13:02.999
- Ooh, like an all-star team.
- Or like the Avengers.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.261
- Yeah, I mean, I don't know
how many metaphors

13:04.305 --> 13:05.393
that we need to say
to explain this.

13:05.436 --> 13:06.437
- Frankenstein.

13:06.481 --> 13:07.743
- So where are all

13:07.787 --> 13:09.266
these random car parts
supposed to come from?

13:11.268 --> 13:13.140
- These are
the employees' cars.

13:13.183 --> 13:14.924
- Which they brought
onto company property.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.186
You can do whatever
you want to something

13:16.230 --> 13:17.797
if it's on your property.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.189
- Legally speaking,
that's not--

13:19.233 --> 13:20.887
- All right, everybody.
Let's go make a car.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.671
Come on.

14:27.475 --> 14:29.869

Only take a sec.

14:57.418 --> 14:58.985

14:59.028 --> 15:00.551
- Just hold this here

- Okay.
- Nice support.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.788
So in retrospect,
I think talking

15:19.831 --> 15:22.095
about what your bedsheets
looked like,

15:22.138 --> 15:24.619
yeah, that might've
been a mistake.

15:24.662 --> 15:26.664
- It wasn't ideal.

I would never--I'm sorry.

15:34.237 --> 15:36.457

15:40.026 --> 15:41.679
- Hey, guys.

15:41.723 --> 15:43.464
- Hey.
- I just--

15:43.507 --> 15:45.770
- It should go without saying,
but don't bang in here, okay?

15:45.814 --> 15:46.989
- Oh, no--
- No, no, that's not--we--

15:47.033 --> 15:48.295
- I would never.

15:48.338 --> 15:49.861
- You can bang in here later.

15:49.905 --> 15:51.776
It's not a problem for me.
It's just, show's in an hour.

15:51.820 --> 15:54.692
So no banging now.
I'm not a prude.

[upbeat music]

15:57.695 --> 15:59.959
- Thank you all so much
for coming tonight.

16:00.002 --> 16:03.788
I have been asked to introduce
our new female CEO.

16:03.832 --> 16:07.183
- Is it good?
I can't tell.

16:07.227 --> 16:09.838
- It is interesting.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.840
- Yep, I mean, it's eclectic.

16:11.883 --> 16:16.976
It's got a sort of
bohemian/rococo/steampunk vibe.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.629
- I'm not sure
it's something I'd drive,

16:18.673 --> 16:20.457
but you definitely have a car.

16:20.501 --> 16:22.459
- What do you think?

16:22.503 --> 16:24.984
- How do I put this?

16:25.027 --> 16:28.378
It looks like something Bjork
would drive to the Oscars.

16:28.422 --> 16:30.119
Mm-mm, scratch that.

16:30.163 --> 16:33.731
It looks like if Bjork were
driving to the Oscars

16:33.775 --> 16:35.820
and got into a head-on
collision with Blossom

16:35.864 --> 16:37.387
on the way to prom,

16:37.431 --> 16:40.303
and then the car was
reassembled by a blind villager

16:40.347 --> 16:43.959
from a tribe
that had never seen technology

16:44.003 --> 16:48.790
and a spider on LSD
who also had bad taste.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.231
- Well, at least
it's not racist.

16:58.887 --> 17:01.150
- Now, a number
of you might be wondering

17:01.194 --> 17:02.891
why the board
put this woman in charge

17:02.934 --> 17:05.763
when Paynes have been running
Payne Motors successfully

17:05.807 --> 17:07.896
for over 100 years.

17:09.115 --> 17:10.638
Thank you.

17:10.681 --> 17:15.208
[applause]

17:15.251 --> 17:17.166
[laughs]

17:17.210 --> 17:18.472
- Thank you, Wesley.

17:18.515 --> 17:20.126
It's good stuff
to think about...

17:20.169 --> 17:22.954
- Just unplug this
'cause I'ma keep my job.

17:22.998 --> 17:26.741
- I am honored to get
to present the Ponderosa

17:26.784 --> 17:28.308
to all of you today.

17:28.351 --> 17:33.182
But I am a bit embarrassed
because truth is,

17:33.226 --> 17:37.012
it was developed before
I started at the company.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.145
Honestly,
and this is not false modesty,

17:39.188 --> 17:41.103
I had nothing
to do with this car.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.583
- Not a natural speaker,
is she?

17:42.626 --> 17:43.932
- So ladies and gentlemen,

17:43.975 --> 17:47.327
the car of the future,
the Ponderosa!

- Oh, good.
We're raising expectations.

18:00.514 --> 18:03.560

18:13.788 --> 18:16.747
â™ª In whatever comes our way

18:16.791 --> 18:20.273
- All right, how about that?

18:21.665 --> 18:25.756
Cyrus, maybe you want
to explain your vision to us?

18:25.800 --> 18:27.410
- Oh, no, no, mm-mm, mm-mm.

18:27.454 --> 18:28.933
- Come on, mate, tell them
all about your cool car--ow.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.718
- What a beauty, huh?

18:30.761 --> 18:34.896
I believe it was inspired
by the platypus.

18:34.939 --> 18:36.115
- Is this what a typical day

18:36.158 --> 18:37.551
in the life
of an executive is like?

18:37.594 --> 18:39.509
- Yep, basically.

18:39.553 --> 18:41.163
- I think it is endangered.

18:41.207 --> 18:45.341
- Is it what you expected?
- Yep, pretty much it.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.256
At least I got
to design my own car.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.605
That was pretty cool.

18:48.649 --> 18:50.564
- Yeah, sure.

18:50.607 --> 18:53.436
Who wouldn't want
to design their own car?

18:53.480 --> 18:58.572
- I'm not sure if they live
on land or water...

18:58.615 --> 19:00.269
- Excuse me.
- Actually.

19:00.313 --> 19:01.792
So it's one of those two.

19:01.836 --> 19:04.969
I don't think it's an air--ah!
Anyway, enough from me.

19:05.013 --> 19:10.105
Let me hand it to our director
of comm--mark--something,

19:10.149 --> 19:12.238
Sadie...Mc--

19:13.674 --> 19:14.675
- Thanks.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.372
I just wanted to say

19:16.416 --> 19:19.288
we knew it would be a challenge
to create the world's

19:19.332 --> 19:23.292
first-ever
modular customizable vehicle

19:23.336 --> 19:26.904
where the buyer chooses
the parts themselves

19:26.948 --> 19:31.561
because when everyone gets
to design their own car,

19:31.605 --> 19:33.781
sometimes it'll come out great,

19:33.824 --> 19:36.305
and sometimes
it'll come out like this.

19:36.349 --> 19:38.873
- Exactly, thank you.
I was getting to this.

19:38.916 --> 19:41.267
The point is
we're all different.

19:41.310 --> 19:44.618
So our cars will
reflect the diversity

19:44.661 --> 19:47.664

that is America,

19:47.708 --> 19:49.797

- Hong Kong Exchange is 28 1/4.

20:03.767 --> 20:07.380
- Resign, resign, resign.

20:07.423 --> 20:09.120
I'm just kidding.

20:09.164 --> 20:10.687
- Look, if they'd loved it,

20:10.731 --> 20:11.906
there'd be nowhere
to go but down.

20:11.949 --> 20:13.037
It's like in pharma.

20:13.081 --> 20:14.691
You don't start
with boner pills.

20:14.735 --> 20:17.303
You start with hypertension,
move your way up to boners.

20:17.346 --> 20:20.523
- That's a beautiful sentiment.
- Almost poetic.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.133
- Excuse me.

20:22.177 --> 20:23.570
- So would you like to tell us
which ethnic minority group

you're gonna be targeting next?

No one said anything about it.

20:28.052 --> 20:30.403
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:31.752 --> 20:32.970
- What's with the box?

20:33.014 --> 20:34.537
- Oh, I'm just
cleaning out my locker.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.365
- Wait, you're leaving?

20:36.409 --> 20:38.411
If this is
about the truck plant thing,

20:38.454 --> 20:39.629
that was just an offer.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.631
Like, you don't have to go.

20:41.675 --> 20:43.807
- Why?
You scared you'll miss me?

20:43.851 --> 20:46.245
- Please.
15,000 people work here.

20:46.288 --> 20:48.421
It's not like we'll be running
into each other

20:48.464 --> 20:49.509
in the halls, so--

20:49.552 --> 20:51.902
- Oh, hey just take
any open desk.

- Oh, cool, cool.
- Wait, what?

What's happening?
- Oh, I bumped him upstairs.

perspective up here.

each other occasionally.
