00:28.314 --> 00:35.588
*

00:40.926 --> 00:42.828
There are stories out there
that need to be told.

00:42.928 --> 00:45.064
There's shit out there
that's just...

00:45.165 --> 00:46.832
you know, wrong.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.270
People need to know about it.
That's the job.

00:50.370 --> 00:52.037
It's not a complicated job,

00:52.138 --> 00:55.841
other than how it'll mess
with your life.

00:55.941 --> 00:58.611
News used to be a bunch of guys
who look like me

00:58.711 --> 01:00.946
huddled around a desk
at a Page One meeting

01:01.046 --> 01:03.549
deciding what the news was.

01:03.649 --> 01:08.087
This little fucker changed
all of that.

01:08.188 --> 01:09.422
I've been fired
from three papers,

01:09.522 --> 01:10.890
hired back at two of them.

01:10.990 --> 01:12.392
Third got gobbled up by
Knight Ridder.

01:12.492 --> 01:13.759
So, to be clear here,

01:13.859 --> 01:16.529
I'm a goddamn reservoir
of do's and don'ts.

01:16.629 --> 01:18.631
Your sources are your Sherpas.

01:18.731 --> 01:20.633
Your editor is your priest.

01:20.733 --> 01:23.503
Honesty is not a tactic.

01:25.505 --> 01:26.939
You still want this job?

01:27.039 --> 01:28.808
It's your money.

01:28.908 --> 01:30.610
I'm Daniel Molloy.

-Can he make his fantasy

Announcer: Walker at
the top of the key.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.122
Pick and roll from Jones.
Walker drives and finishes.

01:43.223 --> 01:47.627
With a tough left hand. That's
seven straight for Walker...

[Sirens wailing,
horns honking in distance]

01:58.338 --> 02:02.208
[Cellphone buzzing]

02:05.845 --> 02:08.514
Daniel: Yeah. Hey, doc. Yeah.
Thanks for getting back to me.

02:08.614 --> 02:11.317
I, uh...
Yes, that's right. I have --

02:11.417 --> 02:13.286
I have an appointment scheduled
for later in the week,

02:13.386 --> 02:15.421
but the -- the thing
I'm trying to figure out is,

02:15.521 --> 02:17.990
what's the deal
with this sub-variant business?

02:18.090 --> 02:19.492
I mean, is that more contagious?

02:19.592 --> 02:21.327
Is it...

02:21.427 --> 02:22.795
Uh-huh.

02:22.895 --> 02:26.366
Yeah, 'cause, I mean,
there's no reason to get more...

02:26.466 --> 02:29.001
Okay. So you think --
Yeah.

02:29.101 --> 02:30.370
I mean, that's what
I'm thinking.

02:30.470 --> 02:32.672
Why get any closer
to the bug than I --

02:32.772 --> 02:34.507
than I need to?

02:34.607 --> 02:38.378
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

02:38.478 --> 02:40.313
Uh-huh.

02:42.415 --> 02:44.484
I gotta call you back.

02:46.652 --> 02:48.654
[Sighs]

03:02.468 --> 03:04.504
[Inhales deeply]

03:05.838 --> 03:07.607
[Static crackling]

03:08.908 --> 03:11.210
Daniel: Um, first question.

03:11.311 --> 03:14.647
You weren't always
a vampire, were you?

03:14.747 --> 03:16.081
Louis: No.

03:16.181 --> 03:21.086
I was a 33-year-old man
when I became a vampire.

03:21.186 --> 03:22.855
Daniel: How did it come about?

03:22.955 --> 03:25.491
Louis: There's a simple
answer to that.

03:25.591 --> 03:29.329
I don't believe I wanna
give simple answers.

03:29.429 --> 03:31.397
I think I want to tell
the real stor--

03:31.497 --> 03:32.965
[Clicks]

03:39.372 --> 03:41.240
Louis: "Dear Mr. Molloy.

03:41.341 --> 03:44.944
I hope this letter finds
you safe and thriving,

03:45.044 --> 03:47.112
if such a thing were
a possibility

03:47.212 --> 03:49.915
in this bleak hour.

03:50.015 --> 03:52.352
I've been following your career
with some interest

03:52.452 --> 03:54.186
since our last meeting.

03:54.286 --> 03:58.257
Please allow me to congratulate
you on all your successes,

03:58.358 --> 04:03.429
those professional and those
personally redemptive.

04:03.529 --> 04:05.598
The passage of time
and the frailties

04:05.698 --> 04:09.902
that accompany it have
provided me perspective.

04:10.002 --> 04:13.939
And I suspect the same
might be for you, as well.

04:14.039 --> 04:15.808
I'm hoping health and pride

04:15.908 --> 04:19.311
won't deter you
from the following proposal.

04:19.412 --> 04:23.483
In a week's time,
in a setting of my choosing,

04:23.583 --> 04:25.050
we revisit the project

04:25.150 --> 04:28.153
boyish youth
prevented us from finishing.

04:28.253 --> 04:30.890
49 years
and thousands of miles

04:30.990 --> 04:34.627
removed from the room
we shared in San Francisco,

04:34.727 --> 04:38.631
I offer, for your
journalistic pleasures,

04:38.731 --> 04:42.468
my full attention
and my life story.

All affinities,

04:44.103 --> 04:47.139

04:47.239 --> 04:49.975
Daniel: I told my editor I was
meeting with the, uh,

04:50.075 --> 04:52.778
most dangerous man in the world.

04:52.878 --> 04:53.979
Gave him two choices.

04:54.079 --> 04:57.349
He came back with
"Bezos. Putin."

04:57.450 --> 04:59.251
He thinks I'm in PraskovÃ©yevka.

04:59.351 --> 05:01.821
[Louis chuckles lightly]

05:01.921 --> 05:04.457
You've grown old, Daniel.

05:06.058 --> 05:10.463
Yeah, well, mortality
beats a heavy drum.

05:11.363 --> 05:13.799
I wasn't sure
you'd remembered me.

05:13.899 --> 05:17.637
Your book makes no mention
of our prior meeting.

05:18.538 --> 05:21.474
Gritty memoir, drugs,
humiliation,

05:21.574 --> 05:23.809
self-pity kind of thing.

05:23.909 --> 05:25.845
Mention vampires
in one of those,

05:25.945 --> 05:27.547
readers tend to
call bullshit.

05:27.647 --> 05:31.383
You've had some
health concerns of late.

05:31.484 --> 05:33.519
Whole planet's having
a moment, I'd say.

05:33.619 --> 05:36.088
You have
Parkinson's disease, Daniel.

05:38.624 --> 05:39.725
Yeah.

05:39.825 --> 05:42.061
And you've got your own hangar
at the airport,

05:42.161 --> 05:44.196
privileges on
the Royal Meydan Bridge,

05:44.296 --> 05:45.798
and zero presence online.

05:45.898 --> 05:48.468
Have I hit a nerve?

05:48.568 --> 05:50.636
I know the Emirates
are big on privacy,

05:50.736 --> 05:51.904
and that's probably
important to you,

05:52.004 --> 05:54.640
but I gotta ask,
what does it cost,

05:54.740 --> 05:57.543
this haven't-aged-in-
half-a-century,

05:57.643 --> 06:00.212
killer-views-in-
all-directions anonymity?

06:00.312 --> 06:02.448
Quite a lot.

06:04.650 --> 06:07.687
Only my family and my doctor
know I'm sick.

06:07.787 --> 06:09.321
I don't dig
the one-way hack.

06:09.421 --> 06:11.223
Yeah?

06:11.323 --> 06:13.759
And here's another question.

06:13.859 --> 06:16.228
That's the sun
out there.

06:16.328 --> 06:18.864
Where's your coffin?

06:18.964 --> 06:20.800
You're standing in it.

06:26.672 --> 06:30.543
I have to be very careful
whom I let in.

06:34.614 --> 06:36.482
[Sizzling]

06:38.851 --> 06:40.820
[Groans]

06:43.122 --> 06:46.291
Yeah, well, things didn't
end well the last time,

06:46.391 --> 06:50.162
so forgive me
if I'm a little nervous.

06:51.897 --> 06:57.136
Louis: This, after all I've told
you, is what you ask for, boy?!

06:57.236 --> 06:59.905
Daniel: Yeah, well, you don't
know what human life is like.

07:00.005 --> 07:02.808
I mean, you've forgotten, man.

07:02.908 --> 07:05.144
I mean, you don't even
understand the meaning

07:05.244 --> 07:07.012
of your own story!

07:08.981 --> 07:12.084
[Clattering]
No! Hey, stop!

07:12.184 --> 07:15.087
[Shouting]

07:15.187 --> 07:17.489
[Clicks]
You were disrespectful.

07:17.590 --> 07:18.758
I was high.

07:18.858 --> 07:21.393
You were not worthy
of my story then.

07:21.493 --> 07:24.096
Maybe your story
wasn't worth telling.

07:27.199 --> 07:29.835
You've got the tapes.
Hire a transcriber.

07:29.935 --> 07:33.272
I don't do puff
portraiture anymore.

07:33.372 --> 07:35.474
And yet,
you got on a plane,

07:35.575 --> 07:38.678
with an auto-immune disease,
in the middle of a pandemic.

07:41.947 --> 07:43.616
Alright.

07:46.118 --> 07:49.288
That's my voice,
but I don't remember it.

07:50.623 --> 07:52.157
I ask all
the wrong questions.

07:52.257 --> 07:53.492
Yes.
There's contradictions

07:53.593 --> 07:55.460
in your story I never
follow up on.

07:55.561 --> 07:56.762
Yes.

07:56.862 --> 07:58.197
The few good ones I do
manage to get out,

07:58.297 --> 07:59.632
you steamroll over them.

07:59.732 --> 08:02.434
It's not an interview.
It's a...

08:02.534 --> 08:05.638
It's a fever dream
told to an idiot.

08:05.738 --> 08:07.707
Yes.

08:07.807 --> 08:10.442
And you?

08:10.542 --> 08:13.512
Why again?
What's changed?

08:13.613 --> 08:17.216
The world,
circumstances.

08:17.316 --> 08:19.084
Me, I've changed.

08:22.154 --> 08:25.858
And I, too,
find the tapes lacking.

08:25.958 --> 08:28.628
So...

08:28.728 --> 08:30.429
a do-over.

08:31.964 --> 08:34.033
[Computer beeps]

08:34.133 --> 08:36.268
Truth and reconciliation.

08:38.971 --> 08:40.873
I ask the questions.
You answer the questions.

08:40.973 --> 08:44.810
Anything that can't be verified,
I send to my researcher.

08:44.910 --> 08:47.012
No third parties.
I write it.

08:47.112 --> 08:49.181
You get to see it
before it goes to print.

08:49.281 --> 08:50.382
I get the final edit.

08:50.482 --> 08:51.817
That is not the agreement
you signed.

08:51.917 --> 08:54.386
And one more thing.

08:54.486 --> 08:56.722
I do my best work
one-on-one.

08:56.822 --> 08:59.725
Would you see to
Mr. Molloy's room?

08:59.825 --> 09:01.226
Have Chef prepare
a meal for him.

09:01.326 --> 09:03.896
I think it best we start
when our boy's had a rest.

09:03.996 --> 09:06.398
I am not your
fucking boy.

09:06.498 --> 09:11.236
I'm an old man with all
the triggers that come with it.

09:11.336 --> 09:13.072
And I'm ready.

09:13.172 --> 09:15.140
So let's do this.

09:18.210 --> 09:19.411
I'm Daniel Molloy.

09:19.511 --> 09:24.549
It is 10:08 in the morning
on June 14, 2022.

09:24.650 --> 09:28.253
I'm in the penthouse apartment
of the Al Sharaf Towers

09:28.353 --> 09:31.023
across from Mister...

09:31.123 --> 09:33.759
Louis de Pointe du Lac.

09:33.859 --> 09:35.560
So...

09:35.661 --> 09:37.797
Mr. du Lac...

09:37.897 --> 09:40.199
how long have you
been dead?

09:40.299 --> 09:43.302
[Chuckles]

09:45.537 --> 09:49.274
Louis: The year was 1910,
the fall of the fifth year

09:49.374 --> 09:52.611
of my father's passing
and the fall of the fifth year

09:52.712 --> 09:54.046
as the executor in charge

09:54.146 --> 09:55.981
of the de Pointe du Lac
family trust.

09:56.081 --> 09:58.617
The eldest son.
The favored son.

09:58.718 --> 10:02.287
And a sizable trust
to oversee as a consequence.

10:02.387 --> 10:04.724
Capital accrued from
plantations of sugar

10:04.824 --> 10:07.626
and the blood of men who looked
like my great grandfather

10:07.727 --> 10:09.995
but did not have
his standing.

10:10.095 --> 10:11.831
But then decades of Jim Crow

10:11.931 --> 10:14.099
and the electrified light
of a new century

10:14.199 --> 10:17.336
had vanquished any idea
of a free man of color.

10:17.436 --> 10:19.805
So it followed the only place
in New Orleans

10:19.905 --> 10:23.242
a gentleman of my complexion
could do a righteous business

10:23.342 --> 10:25.644
was a neighborhood
called Storyville.

10:25.745 --> 10:28.413
That was the old
red-light district. Yeah?

10:28.513 --> 10:30.950
20 blocks of drinking,
gambling,

10:31.050 --> 10:33.018
and gluttonous whoring.

10:33.118 --> 10:35.687
Okay, so as
the honorable executor

10:35.788 --> 10:37.656
of the family's estate,
you were in

10:37.757 --> 10:40.025
what business exactly,
Mr. du Lac?

10:40.125 --> 10:43.128
You could say I managed
and operated

10:43.228 --> 10:46.665
a diversified portfolio
of enterprises.

10:46.766 --> 10:48.167
You were a pimp.

10:48.267 --> 10:50.135
The product was desire,

10:50.235 --> 10:53.172
and it came in as many forms
as there were ways to move it.

10:53.272 --> 10:56.341
Of the two dozen sporting
houses on Liberty Street,

10:56.441 --> 10:58.010
I owned eight of them.

10:58.110 --> 11:01.146
Modest in proportion
to the venues on Basin Street.

11:01.246 --> 11:03.348
What they lacked in size
and elegance,

11:03.448 --> 11:07.052
they more than made up for
in efficiency and reputation.

11:07.152 --> 11:08.220
Mr. du Lac.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.055
Louis: Finn.

11:10.990 --> 11:14.226
You hiding any bills in them
fat fucking rolls of yours?

11:14.326 --> 11:17.863
I was, admittedly,
a rougher thing then.

11:17.963 --> 11:19.231
Woman: Mr. du Lac!

11:19.331 --> 11:21.867
You had to be
if you wanted to survive.

11:21.967 --> 11:24.069
You couldn't look weak
on Liberty Street.

11:24.169 --> 11:25.537
Damn, Doris,
you gon' lose your

11:25.637 --> 11:27.372
good leg runnin'
out like that.

11:27.472 --> 11:30.976
Mr. du Lac, sir,
we got bad trouble.

11:31.076 --> 11:35.414
I apologize. I apologize.
I apologize.

11:35.514 --> 11:37.749
I was only tryna
show you my love.

11:37.850 --> 11:39.051
Fuck you.

11:39.151 --> 11:40.920
[Groans]
What happened?

11:41.020 --> 11:42.521
The cunny hit me!
Oh, I'm a cunny now?

11:42.621 --> 11:44.089
A minute ago,
I was his love.

11:44.189 --> 11:46.458
[Groans]

11:47.292 --> 11:49.194
Alderman Fenwick?
Hmm?

11:49.294 --> 11:52.397
You hit an alderman?
God damn it, Bricks.

11:52.497 --> 11:54.233
He stuck it
in my shitbox.

11:54.333 --> 11:55.567
I did no such thing.

11:55.667 --> 11:57.169
Gave him a chance to pull out,
and he kept on fucking,

11:57.269 --> 11:59.238
so I gave him a little squirt
of my catfish dinner

11:59.338 --> 12:00.572
for going there.

12:00.672 --> 12:02.241
Don't believe me,
check his dick.

12:02.341 --> 12:04.910
Who the fuck you talkin' to?
I ain't checkin' no man's dick.

12:05.010 --> 12:06.745
Oh.
Oh, goddamn.

12:06.846 --> 12:08.914
Hell, I mighta even said yes
if you would just ask.

12:09.014 --> 12:10.850
But I don't care who you is,
you put a dick in an asshole

12:10.950 --> 12:12.751
without asking,
that's against Jesus.

12:12.852 --> 12:14.119
Fuck you.

12:14.219 --> 12:15.921
[Laughter]
What y'all laughin' at?

12:16.021 --> 12:17.890
Someone go and fetch
Doc Johnson.

12:17.990 --> 12:21.393
And you, get some
clean water and a towel.

12:23.695 --> 12:27.066
Get your hands
off me, nigger!

12:27.166 --> 12:29.869
You gon' make me regret
my support, you repeat yourself,

12:29.969 --> 12:32.504
Mr. Fenwick.

12:33.372 --> 12:36.141
Louis de Pointe du Lac, sir.

12:36.241 --> 12:38.978
Oh, Pointe du Lac.

12:39.078 --> 12:42.081
Oh, forgive me. I...

12:42.181 --> 12:44.383
It was...
There's so much wine.

12:44.483 --> 12:47.319
Don't worry none.
We'll keep this here 'tween us.

12:47.419 --> 12:49.588
Someone got the good doc
on the way.

12:51.356 --> 12:55.660
Oh, Miss Williams.
Isn't she a vision?

12:55.760 --> 12:57.963
I ain't
cleanin' his dick.

12:58.063 --> 12:59.064
Oh, Jesus, Mary.

12:59.164 --> 13:00.499
Got a situation
here, Finn.

13:00.599 --> 13:03.002
Yeah, well, you got another one
outside 122.

13:03.102 --> 13:04.970
Man acting the maggot,
driving away business.

13:05.070 --> 13:07.907
Ain't that what
I pay you for?

13:08.007 --> 13:10.409
It's a citizen priest.

13:10.509 --> 13:12.077
Do you not realize,
sister, your body

13:12.177 --> 13:13.478
is part of
Christ the Lord?

13:13.578 --> 13:15.280
Second time this month.
When you take that body

13:15.380 --> 13:16.916
and enjoin in harlotry
you are defiling the Lord.

13:17.016 --> 13:18.650
And I could give two moons if
he's your brother, Mr. du Lac.

13:18.750 --> 13:20.019
I'm gonna knock his skull
in the Pontchartrain!

13:20.119 --> 13:21.786
...you deny
your victory with Christ.

13:21.887 --> 13:24.156
He shall come again to judge
the living and the dead.

13:24.256 --> 13:26.358
And who has come and gone
will rise again

13:26.458 --> 13:28.160
and throw their bodies
into everlasting fire.

13:28.260 --> 13:30.762
Go on home.
Tell Mama not to wait up.

13:30.862 --> 13:32.797
There's blood
on your shirt.

13:32.898 --> 13:33.999
What wickedness
is it tonight?

13:34.099 --> 13:35.800
You're not helping
me here, Paul.

13:35.901 --> 13:37.669
Oh, but I am.

13:37.769 --> 13:40.472
The Lord told me
to come, Louis.

13:40.572 --> 13:42.975
In my head, like a family
of birds, many voices,

13:43.075 --> 13:44.209
but also one voice --

13:44.309 --> 13:45.945
Saying it
a second time.

13:46.045 --> 13:47.012
Listen to me, please.

13:47.112 --> 13:49.114
I'm having
a fucking night, okay?

13:49.214 --> 13:50.382
I can't have it with
you foo--

13:50.482 --> 13:51.850
[Grunts]

13:51.951 --> 13:54.486
[Crowd gasping]

13:54.586 --> 13:58.790
Get on home, else I'll bleed
ya like a kochon, bruh.

13:58.890 --> 14:01.460
[Crowd shouting]

14:01.560 --> 14:05.664
*

14:05.764 --> 14:08.533
Louis: Did I want to pull
a knife on my brother?

14:08.633 --> 14:10.035
No.

14:10.135 --> 14:12.737
But as I alluded to before,

14:12.837 --> 14:16.475
you couldn't look weak
on Liberty.

14:16.575 --> 14:19.278
You never knew
who was watching.

14:22.247 --> 14:24.516
[Horse neighs]

14:24.616 --> 14:26.218
Paul: He pulled his knife
on me, Mamaw.

14:26.318 --> 14:28.720
Louis: You were disrupting
mother's business interests.

14:28.820 --> 14:31.890
D'you hear that, Mother?
He's made you a madam.

14:31.991 --> 14:33.158
Oh, Paul.

14:33.258 --> 14:35.227
Profiting from
the damnation of souls.

14:35.327 --> 14:37.429
Let's not fuss
on the particulars.

14:37.529 --> 14:41.200
Louis: Mornings with my family
followed a pattern that year.

14:41.300 --> 14:43.735
My mother consumed herself
with preparations

14:43.835 --> 14:45.670
for my sister's wedding,

14:45.770 --> 14:47.739
while Paul confused
the dining table

14:47.839 --> 14:49.908
with a pulpit none of us
would recognize.

14:50.009 --> 14:51.876
We should tithe that o'er
to St. Augustine's

14:51.977 --> 14:53.412
'fore this house
falls in on us.

14:53.512 --> 14:55.247
This is just a temporary
situation

14:55.347 --> 14:58.717
until Louis can find us
a more respectable business.

14:58.817 --> 15:00.852
Daddy was here,
we'd still be in sugar cane.

15:00.952 --> 15:02.621
Daddy was alive,
you'd still be locked up

15:02.721 --> 15:03.888
in that
hospital in Jackson.

15:03.989 --> 15:05.857
Louis, let's not
have that talk.

15:05.957 --> 15:08.860
A month from my wedding day,
and what do I dream about?

15:08.960 --> 15:10.762
Dancing in
my husband's arms?

15:10.862 --> 15:13.765
Children running
in the yard? No.

15:13.865 --> 15:15.800
I dream of what a quiet
breakfast might look like.

15:15.900 --> 15:18.903
Your man Levi's a Baptist,
no respect for the Holy Mother.

15:19.004 --> 15:20.205
Florence: Paul!

15:20.305 --> 15:21.540
He's gon' make your daughter
jump a broom.

15:21.640 --> 15:22.941
I'm sitting right here.
Plenty of brooms

15:23.042 --> 15:24.943
down the street at
the Mayfair sisters' home.

15:25.044 --> 15:26.078
[Laughs]

15:26.178 --> 15:27.446
He's calling me
a witch, Mamaw.

15:27.546 --> 15:30.149
Paul de Pointe du Lac,
you walk that back.

15:30.249 --> 15:32.151
[Laughing]

15:32.251 --> 15:34.653
Daniel: Your brother sounds
like a pain in the ass.

15:34.753 --> 15:37.422
Louis: Fragile,
stubborn, indulged.

15:37.522 --> 15:39.324
I'd promised our father
on his death bed

15:39.424 --> 15:40.925
to look after him.

15:41.026 --> 15:44.796
But when Paul's mind was right,
he was no burden.

15:44.896 --> 15:48.433
Point of fact, I loved him
more than anyone on earth.

15:48.533 --> 15:50.735
And our daily stroll
to St. Augustine

15:50.835 --> 15:53.972
was the measure
of a good day started.

15:54.073 --> 15:57.309
Good morning, Paul.
Paul: Good for you maybe.

15:57.409 --> 15:59.078
Morning, Louis.

15:59.178 --> 16:00.579
Pew's got a good shine.

16:00.679 --> 16:03.815
If it wasn't beneath you,
I'd send shoes your way.

16:03.915 --> 16:05.584
Nothing is
beneath me, son.

16:05.684 --> 16:07.452
Paul: I'm ready, Father.

16:09.421 --> 16:12.091
I wanted to thank the family for
last Sunday's donation.

16:12.191 --> 16:14.659
Baby-sitting money.
Church calms him down some.

16:14.759 --> 16:16.161
Well, we're always
here for him.

16:16.261 --> 16:18.830
And the money goes a good way
towards the renovation.

16:18.930 --> 16:21.700
I want Father Matthias.
Thank you.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.868
You ain't got nothing
to confess to anyhow.

16:23.968 --> 16:25.937
Wasting
a good man's time.

16:26.037 --> 16:28.840
Be right there, Paul.

16:28.940 --> 16:31.510
I haven't seen you in
confession of late, Louis.

16:31.610 --> 16:33.378
[Chuckles]

16:33.478 --> 16:36.748
You know, you can always come
here if you're in need, son.

16:39.818 --> 16:44.022
Louis: My business and my raised
religion were at odds,

16:44.123 --> 16:46.725
and the, uh...

16:46.825 --> 16:50.195
latencies within me, well,
I beat those back

16:50.295 --> 16:53.365
with a lie I told myself
about myself --

16:53.465 --> 16:56.000
that I was a red-blooded son
of the South,

16:56.101 --> 16:59.037
seeking ass before absolution.

16:59.138 --> 17:03.007
Daniel: And you maintained
this delusion how exactly?

17:03.108 --> 17:06.378
Louis: A particular woman who
worked for the competition.

17:06.478 --> 17:09.047
As if rickety shacks
were a competition

17:09.148 --> 17:12.083
for Tom Anderson's
Fairplay Saloon.

17:12.184 --> 17:15.354
Ah, Louis du Lac.
The night begins.

17:15.454 --> 17:17.522
Miss Carroll, Miss Lily
working tonight?

17:17.622 --> 17:19.158
Miss Lily's
on the terrace.

17:19.258 --> 17:22.561
It was a palace of opulence
and splendor.

17:22.661 --> 17:24.496
A Sazerac,
Mr. du Lac?

17:24.596 --> 17:26.030
That'll do fine,
Miss Carroll.

17:26.131 --> 17:28.200
And catered to
an almost exclusively

17:28.300 --> 17:30.001
Caucasian clientele,

17:30.101 --> 17:31.903
which helped me
separate the locals

17:32.003 --> 17:35.940
from those visiting
from other southern states.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.909
Shakin' the money tree
tonight I see,

17:38.009 --> 17:39.211
Mr. Anderson, sir.

17:39.311 --> 17:41.580
Can't see the dirt
for the dollars fallin'.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.416
Private game on Friday
if your datebook is free, Louis.

17:44.516 --> 17:47.719
Can do, Mr. Anderson.
Can do.

17:47.819 --> 17:53.925
*

17:54.025 --> 18:00.131
*

18:00.232 --> 18:03.435
[Man speaking French]

18:03.535 --> 18:06.137
Woman: I don't know much
what you're saying.

18:06.238 --> 18:07.972
But it sure sounds nice.

18:08.072 --> 18:10.909
"Only the impossible
can do the impossible."

18:11.009 --> 18:13.712
[Laughs]
Miss Lily.

18:13.812 --> 18:16.815
Bonsoir, monsieur.
Do you speak French?

18:16.915 --> 18:19.784
We speak all sorts of tongues
in New Orleans.

18:19.884 --> 18:21.953
It's a hard table to get.
How'd you manage it?

18:22.053 --> 18:24.656
How'd you manage to get yourself
through the front door?

18:25.890 --> 18:26.925
Excuse me?

18:27.025 --> 18:28.260
I mean that
as a compliment,

18:28.360 --> 18:30.995
a man of your race
to have privileges here.

18:31.095 --> 18:34.299
Louis has a small empire
of his own down the street.

18:34.399 --> 18:35.634
[Chuckles]
It gives him privileges.

18:35.734 --> 18:36.735
[Laughs]

18:36.835 --> 18:39.738
Somethin' funny
about that?

18:39.838 --> 18:41.840
Your name is Louis.

18:41.940 --> 18:44.075
Of course it's Louis.

18:44.175 --> 18:46.278
I didn't get
your name, fella.

18:50.349 --> 18:51.850
I know who you are, sir.

18:51.950 --> 18:54.753
You're the man who made me
buy a townhouse in the quarter.

18:54.853 --> 18:57.556
I owe you everything.
Please, join us.

18:59.591 --> 19:02.661
I know sometimes
men of my race,

19:02.761 --> 19:05.330
we all look alike
to you people.

19:05.430 --> 19:07.031
But I didn't sell you
no townhouse.

19:07.131 --> 19:09.334
Louis, have a seat.

19:09.434 --> 19:10.702
Let me explain.

19:10.802 --> 19:13.838
New to the...
the New World, I am.

19:13.938 --> 19:15.206
That explains
the clothes.

19:15.307 --> 19:17.842
[Chuckles] A 19th-century man
at heart, yes,

19:17.942 --> 19:20.679
making his, uh, trans-Atlantic
journey by ship,

19:20.779 --> 19:23.882
planning very carefully
on settling myself upriver.

19:23.982 --> 19:25.183
Waiter:
The Sazerac, sir.

19:25.284 --> 19:26.618
Put that on my account,
thank you.

19:26.718 --> 19:28.219
And two more for us.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.589
And another round for the
musicians, whatever they want.

19:31.723 --> 19:33.458
Yes, sir.

19:33.558 --> 19:35.294
Oh, where was I?

19:35.394 --> 19:37.296
On a boat.

19:37.396 --> 19:39.230
[Chuckles]

19:43.134 --> 19:44.503
[Gasps]
So, I'm out on

19:44.603 --> 19:46.505
the Crescent coast,
floating past your village,

19:46.605 --> 19:49.007
when I hear music playing,

19:49.107 --> 19:53.378
and the shadows of men and women
dancing by the water's edge.

19:53.478 --> 19:58.717
I disembarked for the music,
but then there was the food.

19:58.817 --> 20:00.752
What's been your favorite
this year, Mr. Lioncourt?

20:00.852 --> 20:02.086
A favorite?

20:02.186 --> 20:03.221
Mm.
Mm.

20:03.322 --> 20:06.157
She puts a pistol
to my head.

20:06.257 --> 20:08.760
Louis:
I couldn't believe it.

20:08.860 --> 20:10.695
Staring me down as his hands

20:10.795 --> 20:14.533
went wandering the seams
of Miss Lily's dress.

20:14.633 --> 20:16.167
I wanted to take the end
of my cane

20:16.267 --> 20:19.003
and slit his throat
with it.

20:19.103 --> 20:21.873
Daniel: Why didn't you?

20:21.973 --> 20:23.775
I couldn't move.

20:23.875 --> 20:27.412
My body was seized
with weakness.

20:27.512 --> 20:33.352
His gaze tied a string
around my lungs,

20:33.452 --> 20:36.688
and I found
myself immobilized.

20:36.788 --> 20:41.393
And the women,
all shades of skin --

20:41.493 --> 20:45.697
white, Black, cinnamon.

20:45.797 --> 20:48.933
I've emptied a bank vault
sampling, I must say.

20:49.033 --> 20:52.504
But it was not until
a few nights later...

21:00.412 --> 21:04.315
...that I said to myself...

21:04.416 --> 21:05.950
"Lestat, unpack your trunks.

21:06.050 --> 21:08.186
You're home."
[Laughs]

21:09.220 --> 21:12.090
What did he
say just now?

21:12.190 --> 21:13.958
A little more
than he should of.

21:14.058 --> 21:18.129
I had planned to make a new life
for myself in St. Louis.

21:18.229 --> 21:21.666
That was to be my destiny.

21:21.766 --> 21:24.469
And now I know I was right.

21:24.569 --> 21:26.471
Only it turns out the saint
is not a city,

21:26.571 --> 21:32.076
but a handsome man with
a most agreeable disposition.

21:32.176 --> 21:34.979
You're his destiny,
Louis.

21:35.079 --> 21:37.281
Destined to be
very good friends.

21:39.083 --> 21:41.486
The Orient room is available
for the next few hours,

21:41.586 --> 21:42.821
Miss Lily.

21:42.921 --> 21:44.122
The gentlemen
are swappin'

21:44.222 --> 21:46.324
andouille sausage recipes,
Miss Carroll.

21:46.425 --> 21:47.992
Hmm.

21:48.092 --> 21:55.934
*

21:56.034 --> 21:58.903
[Indistinct chatter]

22:03.241 --> 22:05.510
Carroll: The Orient room
is yours, monsieur.

22:05.610 --> 22:08.146
Lestat: Please get my friend
here anything he wants.

22:08.246 --> 22:09.380
Wonderful to meet you.

22:09.481 --> 22:12.884
I do hope I run into
you again, Louis.

22:12.984 --> 22:18.122
Louis: Emasculation and
admiration in equal measure.

22:18.890 --> 22:23.828
I wanted to murder the man,
and I wanted to be the man.

22:28.299 --> 22:30.969
I had come there for Lily.

22:31.069 --> 22:34.372
But I left thinking of only him.

22:34.473 --> 22:35.874
[Fog horn blows]

22:35.974 --> 22:39.243
[Singing in French]

22:43.247 --> 22:47.185
[Singing in French]

22:55.093 --> 22:58.863
[Singing continues]

23:09.474 --> 23:11.142
[Singing stops]

23:13.177 --> 23:15.446
Come now.

23:18.116 --> 23:19.751
Who the devil...

23:19.851 --> 23:27.225
*

23:27.325 --> 23:29.060
[Growls]

23:29.160 --> 23:31.630
[Screaming]

23:34.165 --> 23:35.767
Our friends in
the police tell me there's

23:35.867 --> 23:37.869
an outbreak of fever in town.

23:37.969 --> 23:40.438
It's unfortunates
living near the wharf, mostly.

23:40.539 --> 23:42.373
If you find yourself
riverside of Decatur...

23:42.473 --> 23:43.608
[Knocking]
...you have only yourself

23:43.708 --> 23:45.143
to blame, I say.

23:45.243 --> 23:46.444
Agreed.

23:46.545 --> 23:48.112
Still, very peculiar,
they say.

23:48.212 --> 23:50.982
Each one the same --
small wounds to the body,

23:51.082 --> 23:55.620
and upon examination,
entirely devoid of blood.

23:55.720 --> 23:57.789
It is their theory
some new kind of rat

23:57.889 --> 23:59.057
has come ashore.

23:59.157 --> 24:01.660
Of the six-foot variety.

24:01.760 --> 24:04.395
We call those bureaucrats
in France.

24:04.495 --> 24:06.965
[Laughter]

24:07.065 --> 24:11.335
Gentlemen, well, you all know
Louis du Lac.

24:11.435 --> 24:15.139
Louis, let me introduce
you to Mr. Lestat de Lioncourt.

24:15.239 --> 24:17.141
We met already,
Mr. Anderson, sir.

24:17.241 --> 24:19.443
In front of a florist,
wasn't it?

24:19.544 --> 24:22.380
We both wanted
the last bouquet of lilies.

24:24.248 --> 24:26.651
Aren't you gonna ask the
alderman how his head is, Louis?

24:26.751 --> 24:29.487
Now, why would I do that,
Mr. Anderson, sir?

24:29.588 --> 24:32.757
You see, Mr. Fenwick,
just as I told you,

24:32.857 --> 24:34.593
a most discreet Negro.

24:34.693 --> 24:37.829
Would that his doctor
had the same standards.

24:37.929 --> 24:40.064
Gentlemen,
show your cards.

24:42.634 --> 24:44.969
Hoo!
Mr. Lioncourt,

24:45.069 --> 24:47.606
your hand
is incomprehensible.

24:47.706 --> 24:50.441
[Laughter]
Oh, yes.

24:50.541 --> 24:52.143
I'm terrible at cards.

24:52.243 --> 24:54.278
Did I not mention
that to everyone?

24:54.378 --> 24:58.116
Would you mind getting me
some more of these money chips?

24:58.216 --> 25:00.151
[Laughter]

25:00.251 --> 25:03.655
Tom: Louis, did you know
that Alderman Fenwick here

25:03.755 --> 25:05.690
recently purchased
both the title and deed

25:05.790 --> 25:07.558
to the Horton rooming house
on Villere Street?

25:07.659 --> 25:09.360
Yeah, Mr. Anderson believes
it could make

25:09.460 --> 25:10.862
a fine sportin' house.

25:10.962 --> 25:13.865
I recommended the alderman
find a managing partner

25:13.965 --> 25:15.399
before he commits his money.

25:15.499 --> 25:17.902
I recommended he
think of you, Louis.

25:18.002 --> 25:20.371
Very kind of you,
Mr. Anderson, sir.

25:20.471 --> 25:23.174
Fenwick: What do you think
of the location?

25:23.274 --> 25:25.076
It ain't Basin Street.

25:25.176 --> 25:27.679
But throw enough Edison bulbs
on the facade,

25:27.779 --> 25:29.180
get a good margin
on the alcohol,

25:29.280 --> 25:31.315
no-nonsense madam
to keep the girls clean,

25:31.415 --> 25:33.384
I reckon a man
could make a decent sum.

25:33.484 --> 25:35.053
Yes, sir,
Mr. Fenwick, sir.

25:35.153 --> 25:37.656
I said you'd do it
for 10 percent.

25:37.756 --> 25:40.091
[Chuckles] A-all respects,
Mr. Anderson,

25:40.191 --> 25:43.527
but you proposing 10 percent
for all the work?

25:43.628 --> 25:45.830
15%?

25:45.930 --> 25:48.399
There's capital
investment,

25:48.499 --> 25:50.869
and there's labor.

25:50.969 --> 25:52.737
Both has its seat
at the table.

25:52.837 --> 25:55.106
Wouldn't you say,
Mr. Lestat?

25:56.975 --> 25:59.243
Well, I can only speak
of my experience,

25:59.343 --> 26:01.579
which is, I'm sure,
different in my country.

26:01.680 --> 26:04.115
Par exemple, you fine gentlemen
have heard of the success story

26:04.215 --> 26:07.786
that is Le Bon MarchÃ©, shopping
experience like no other.

26:07.886 --> 26:09.387
Aristide Boucicaut invests
in a new vision...

26:09.487 --> 26:11.189
Lestat:
These men look down on you.

26:11.289 --> 26:14.726
I have to say, I find it
appalling how men like yourself

26:14.826 --> 26:16.961
are treated
in this country of yours.

26:17.061 --> 26:19.864
It is undeniable.
I came to my wealth honestly

26:19.964 --> 26:21.432
and at great sacrifice,
I might add.

26:21.532 --> 26:23.702
However, it was not
the sacrifice of many.

26:23.802 --> 26:25.436
I had no partners
in my various...

26:25.536 --> 26:27.706
-Lestat: 10 percent.
-The financial risks...

26:27.806 --> 26:30.341
15 percent.

26:32.977 --> 26:36.480
Do you not know your value?

26:39.250 --> 26:43.587
Do you suffer these indignities
for some larger purpose?

26:43.688 --> 26:50.762
*

26:50.862 --> 26:53.998
And do you think two pair
will win the hour?

26:59.771 --> 27:03.341
I believe there is great
opportunity in this city,

27:03.441 --> 27:08.146
but to seize it, I'll need
protection from the wolves.

27:08.246 --> 27:15.653
*

27:15.754 --> 27:23.027
*

27:23.127 --> 27:24.195
And that's all to say,

27:24.295 --> 27:25.930
forgive me,
Mr. de Pointe du Lac,

27:26.030 --> 27:27.631
for my bias, but where
is the business

27:27.732 --> 27:28.833
if there is no capital?

27:28.933 --> 27:30.701
It does not exist. No?
Alright, boys.

27:30.802 --> 27:32.403
Show 'em.

27:35.606 --> 27:37.275
Ooh.

27:37.375 --> 27:40.378
Full boat, Mr. du Lac.

27:40.478 --> 27:42.881
Got you beat, Tom.

27:42.981 --> 27:45.116
Louis: He wouldn't tell me
how he did it,

27:45.216 --> 27:48.019
his trick to make
the world stop.

27:48.119 --> 27:50.521
"In time, Louis.
Patience, Louis.

27:50.621 --> 27:52.857
Ask me next week, Louis."

27:52.957 --> 27:54.225
Daniel:
You started hanging out?

27:54.325 --> 27:55.860
Louis: He was
in love with my city

27:55.960 --> 27:58.562
and wanted to know
everything he could about it.

27:58.662 --> 28:02.033
Daniel: So you played docent
to the gentleman vampire?

28:02.133 --> 28:05.703
Louis: He had not revealed
his vampire nature yet.

28:05.804 --> 28:07.872
I'm assuming you
only met at night.

28:07.972 --> 28:09.407
It's New Orleans.

28:09.507 --> 28:12.410
Days are for sleeping off
the previous evening's damage.

28:12.510 --> 28:14.345
Perfect cover
for a vampire.

28:14.445 --> 28:16.815
Racing ahead again,
Mr. Molloy.

28:16.915 --> 28:20.351
Let the tale seduce you.

28:20.451 --> 28:22.854
Just as I was seduced.

28:24.322 --> 28:26.590
Money would arrive,
wired from France,

28:26.690 --> 28:29.427
and the shopkeepers, who would
usually close at sunset,

28:29.527 --> 28:32.230
were very happy
to accommodate him.

28:32.330 --> 28:36.367
He ransacked the import houses
to furnish his town house,

28:36.467 --> 28:38.903
ravaged the booksellers of
their oldest volumes

28:39.003 --> 28:40.404
for a library,

28:40.504 --> 28:44.542
and, with encouragement,
updated his wardrobe

28:44.642 --> 28:47.378
to the fashion trends
of the season.

28:47.478 --> 28:52.583
It was a cold winter that year,
and Lestat was my coal fire.

28:52.683 --> 28:55.419
And I found myself
for the very first time,

28:55.519 --> 28:57.521
to anyone other than Paul,

28:57.621 --> 29:00.791
confiding my struggles
to another man.

29:03.962 --> 29:07.065
I was being hunted.

29:07.165 --> 29:10.969
And I was completely unaware
it was happening.

29:13.972 --> 29:15.439
I'm switchin' rooms.

29:15.539 --> 29:17.275
I don't need to hear you
and your good man making noise.

29:17.375 --> 29:18.776
Grace: You'd have to
be home to hear that.

29:18.877 --> 29:21.412
I come home nights.
You come home some nights.

29:21.512 --> 29:23.781
Out cattin' with some
white man, I hear.

29:23.882 --> 29:25.083
He ain't white,
he French.

29:25.183 --> 29:27.886
Oh. That's a new kind
of white, is it?

29:27.986 --> 29:29.153
French white?

29:29.253 --> 29:30.388
He different.

29:30.488 --> 29:32.423
Invite him
over for dinner.

29:32.523 --> 29:34.392
Mother loves European.

29:34.492 --> 29:37.061
I'm gon' tell Levi you fishin'
for a richer man.

29:37.161 --> 29:39.763
Don't.
Don't deny your sister.

29:39.864 --> 29:42.000
I wanna meet
this French white.

29:42.100 --> 29:43.968
[Indistinct talking]

29:44.068 --> 29:45.970
I'm just trying to give you
the word of the Lord.

29:46.070 --> 29:49.908
Understa-- Yes. Yes. No.
That is never my --

29:50.008 --> 29:52.810
Paul crawled up
on my bed last night.

29:52.911 --> 29:55.546
[Paul continues indistinctly]

29:59.017 --> 30:01.452
Wept for good near
an hour.

30:01.552 --> 30:03.787
He ain't takin' it,
you gettin' married.

30:06.057 --> 30:09.928
Levi told me of a place
over in Gretna,

30:10.028 --> 30:11.795
takes in men like Paul.

30:11.896 --> 30:13.164
It's not some
crazy person's house like --

30:13.264 --> 30:15.166
How'd that work
last time, huh?

30:15.266 --> 30:17.368
He come out
worse than before.

30:17.468 --> 30:20.304
Gretna.
It ain't happenin'.

30:20.404 --> 30:22.173
He died on
the cross for you.

30:22.273 --> 30:23.707
Yes...you.

30:23.807 --> 30:25.176
I worry.

30:25.276 --> 30:29.013
I worry so much --
Worry about your own life.

30:29.113 --> 30:32.050
Worry about
being a bride.

30:33.084 --> 30:36.054
Worry about
what you gon' wear

30:36.154 --> 30:40.691
in London, in Paris,
Florence.

30:40.791 --> 30:42.860
Now, y'all gon' be in
steerage outta New York,

30:42.961 --> 30:44.328
but once you
get to Europe,

30:44.428 --> 30:46.530
it's first class on boats,
trains, and hotel rooms.

30:46.630 --> 30:48.899
What did you go and do?
[Laughs]

30:49.000 --> 30:50.468
You should put the band
by the deck

30:50.568 --> 30:53.404
and the food
by the fountain.

30:54.973 --> 30:56.774
[Laughs]

30:58.142 --> 30:59.877
Mamaw!

30:59.978 --> 31:02.713
I'm goin' 'round the world!
[Laughs]

31:02.813 --> 31:04.548
*

31:04.648 --> 31:08.019
[Door opens, closes]

31:11.755 --> 31:14.425
I can't thank you enough,
Mama du Lac.

31:14.525 --> 31:15.659
I never been east of Alabama,

31:15.759 --> 31:17.695
and now I'm going
to see the pyramids.

31:17.795 --> 31:19.663
Oh, I think every
young family deserves

31:19.763 --> 31:21.765
a little adventure.

31:21.865 --> 31:23.767
Wouldn't you say,
Monsieur Lioncourt?

31:23.867 --> 31:25.169
Oui, Madame.

31:25.269 --> 31:28.072
My mother, she gave me
every advantage in life

31:28.172 --> 31:29.507
as a young man.

31:29.607 --> 31:32.710
My first Mastiff,
first flintlock rifle,

31:32.810 --> 31:34.178
the means
to make my way to Paris.

31:34.278 --> 31:36.747
It was Louis that purchased
your holiday, Levi.

31:36.847 --> 31:38.116
It's Louis who controls
the money.

31:38.216 --> 31:39.350
Pay no mind, Levi.

31:39.450 --> 31:40.518
And I don't know
who gave you the right

31:40.618 --> 31:41.552
to call our mother
your mother.

31:41.652 --> 31:42.853
She's not your mother yet

31:42.953 --> 31:44.922
and will never be
your scientific mother.

31:45.023 --> 31:48.059
Florence: Paul.

31:48.159 --> 31:50.061
I do love this
bouillabaisse.

31:50.161 --> 31:52.596
Wha?

31:52.696 --> 31:54.698
Down here,
we call it gumbo.

31:54.798 --> 31:56.600
We had a gumbo the other night,
didn't we, Louis?

31:56.700 --> 31:58.102
Uh, right after the opera.

31:58.202 --> 31:59.937
Oh, we've got Louis
to an opera.

32:00.038 --> 32:02.573
"Iolanta."
'Bout some blind princess,

32:02.673 --> 32:04.875
didn't know
she was a princess.

32:04.975 --> 32:06.977
Stomach got grumbling,
left half way through.

32:07.078 --> 32:09.280
And what exactly is the nature
of your relationship with

32:09.380 --> 32:12.183
my brother,
Monsieur Lioncourt?

32:18.722 --> 32:21.125
Your brother and I
have been discussing

32:21.225 --> 32:23.561
a few investment
opportunities.

32:23.661 --> 32:26.164
The birds asked me
to ask you.

32:26.264 --> 32:28.032
I wasn't being rude.

32:30.568 --> 32:32.336
Monsieur Freniere,
would you tell me

32:32.436 --> 32:35.473
how you came to propose
to this delightsome young woman?

32:35.573 --> 32:36.840
Oh, that's
a good yarn.

32:36.940 --> 32:39.177
Are you one with Christ,
Mr. Lioncourt?

32:39.277 --> 32:41.812
How 'bout you shut
your damn mouth?

32:41.912 --> 32:43.647
Florence: Louis.
That's alright,

32:43.747 --> 32:46.450
Louis, Madame,
the birds speak for him.

32:49.520 --> 32:52.556
I came to know Christ
in a monastery.

32:54.758 --> 32:57.661
I wanted
to be a priest.

32:57.761 --> 33:00.331
Just like you, Paul.

33:00.431 --> 33:02.700
And under the guidance
and discipline of the monks

33:02.800 --> 33:07.271
who lived there, I came
to memorize both the testaments,

33:07.371 --> 33:09.173
the writings of Assisi,

33:09.273 --> 33:14.245
Aquinas, Erasmus,
all the saints and scholars.

33:17.781 --> 33:24.155
My father, a vulgar man, did not
think much of this education,

33:24.255 --> 33:28.959
and so he and my brothers
conspired to pull me out,

33:29.059 --> 33:32.463
lock me away,
where, between beatings,

33:32.563 --> 33:35.233
starvations,
and the failure of Christ

33:35.333 --> 33:37.335
to intercede the beatings
and starvations,

33:37.435 --> 33:41.239
I slowly forgot all about
the testaments, Assisi,

your boring question,
there is an ocean

33:47.311 --> 33:49.380
between Christ and myself.
Stop!

Not with my family.

33:59.790 --> 34:01.959
You understand?

34:09.833 --> 34:14.672
I am cursed with my father's
temper at times,

34:14.772 --> 34:16.907
and the rudeness is all mine.

34:17.007 --> 34:18.242

That's alright.

34:18.342 --> 34:20.744
It's the humidity.
It does that sometimes.

some ice wine?

joychild's heart.

a permanent offense at me.

I'd have done the same.

through birds in his head.

with his thoughts.

they may be,

in sharing them.

34:55.713 --> 34:57.281
You sayin' I got shame?

34:57.381 --> 35:00.117
The lie you told about leaving
the opera house early.

35:00.218 --> 35:02.286
You were near weeping
when the curtain fell.

35:02.386 --> 35:04.222
Why hide that
from your family?

35:04.322 --> 35:06.490
Don't everybody need
to know what I do.

in judgment.

Paul is the only one
to say it to my face,

but I know my ma
and Grace think it, too.

My daddy ran our sugar business
into a swamp.

we was four months --

35:20.037 --> 35:23.974

yourself to me, Louis.

around me,

ain't broke are greedy.

I brought with me

36:50.594 --> 36:53.196
from the continent.

lil' song playin'?

36:55.132 --> 36:56.734
Do you like it?

36:56.834 --> 37:00.871
I composed it for a young
violinist I once knew,

37:00.971 --> 37:03.807
a boy of infinite beauty
and sensitivity.

37:06.310 --> 37:08.879

on my body,

42:42.512 --> 42:44.247

59:38.194 --> 59:41.063
This primitive country
has picked you clean.

59:41.163 --> 59:45.567
It has shackled you
in permanent exile.

59:45.668 --> 59:47.436
Every room you enter,

59:47.536 --> 59:49.105
every hat you are forced
to wear --

59:49.205 --> 59:51.774
the stern landlord,
the deferential businessman,

59:51.874 --> 59:53.109
the loyal son --

59:53.209 --> 59:55.111
all these roles
you conform to

59:55.211 --> 59:57.780

your true nature.

59:57.880 --> 59:59.281

as you choke on your sorrow.

1:00:05.554 --> 1:00:07.824
The first time
I laid eyes on you,

1:00:07.924 --> 1:00:09.826
your beautiful face,

1:00:09.926 --> 1:00:12.294
I saw that sorrow.

1:00:12.394 --> 1:00:13.595
I did not know
how it got there

1:00:13.696 --> 1:00:16.766
or why
it was so voluminous.

1:00:19.268 --> 1:00:22.839
I can take away
that sorrow, Louis.

I can give you that death

for a dark gift

begin to imagine.

You just have to
ask me for it.

1:00:55.704 --> 1:00:59.675
You just have to nod
your beautiful head...

It is difficult to explain

1:01:33.475 --> 1:01:36.378
how his words disarmed me,

1:01:36.478 --> 1:01:40.216
how efficiently succinct
and impenetrable

1:01:40.316 --> 1:01:42.318
his argument was.

1:01:42.418 --> 1:01:44.086
All my conceptions,

even my guilt
and my wish to die

1:01:47.256 --> 1:01:49.992
seemed utterly unimportant,

1:01:50.092 --> 1:01:52.094

1:01:52.194 --> 1:01:55.832
and the barbaric scene
that surrounded me.

I was seen.

as a dull roar at first.

1:03:15.177 --> 1:03:17.813
And then a pounding,

1:03:17.914 --> 1:03:20.782
like the pounding of a drum,

1:03:20.883 --> 1:03:25.021
growing louder and louder,

1:03:25.121 --> 1:03:28.657
as if some enormous creature

1:03:28.757 --> 1:03:33.529
were coming through a dark
and alien forest.

a pounding of another drum,

as if another giant
were coming behind him,

1:03:45.908 --> 1:03:49.511
each giant intent
on his own drum,

1:03:49.611 --> 1:03:52.848
giving no notice
to the rhythm of the other.

1:03:52.949 --> 1:04:00.289
Throbbing in my lips, fingers,
and flesh of my temple.

1:04:18.840 --> 1:04:21.978

1:04:22.078 --> 1:04:26.148
And it was then that I realized

1:04:26.248 --> 1:04:29.918
the drum was my heart,

1:04:30.019 --> 1:04:33.455
and the other drum
had been his.

1:04:36.492 --> 1:04:39.128
I saw him sitting
a length away from me.

1:04:40.997 --> 1:04:42.131
Radiant.

1:04:43.165 --> 1:04:45.801

for some time.

of increasing wonder.

the secrets of existence.

You alone of all creatures
can strike like the hand of God.

1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:41.123

to killing.

of what we are.

Louis de Pointe du Lac.

you been dead?

1:06:41.450 --> 1:06:43.185
[Laughs]

1:06:43.285 --> 1:06:45.621
Hi, I'm Rolin Jones,
Executive Producer for

1:06:45.721 --> 1:06:47.123
"Interview with the Vampire,"

1:06:47.223 --> 1:06:50.226
and this is your
Episode Insider.

1:06:50.326 --> 1:06:53.362
There are stories at there
that need to be told.

1:06:53.462 --> 1:06:54.963
I'm Daniel Molloy.

1:06:55.063 --> 1:06:57.399
Daniel Molly, he's a journalist
who's sort of on

1:06:57.499 --> 1:07:01.903
the nadir of his career,
and a package arrives

1:07:02.003 --> 1:07:04.873
and inside is a great deal
of history

1:07:04.973 --> 1:07:08.177
that he did not
want to remember.

1:07:08.277 --> 1:07:10.912
I got to call you back.

1:07:11.012 --> 1:07:12.214
Jones: When he was
a young journalist,

1:07:12.314 --> 1:07:16.084
he made a series of tapes
with a vampire.

1:07:16.185 --> 1:07:18.720
Louis: I think I want to tell
the real stor--

1:07:18.820 --> 1:07:21.890
He's sort of given an invitation
to revisit this interview

1:07:21.990 --> 1:07:24.092
and do it right and proper
when both

1:07:24.193 --> 1:07:26.027
have lived a little life
and are way more

1:07:26.128 --> 1:07:27.396
comfortable in their skin.

1:07:27.496 --> 1:07:31.867
So...a do over.

1:07:31.967 --> 1:07:33.702
Truth and reconciliation.

1:07:33.802 --> 1:07:36.938
He's a very different vampire,
so he's got a lot on his mind.

1:07:37.038 --> 1:07:39.241
Lestat sees
Louis de Pointe du Lac

1:07:39.341 --> 1:07:44.045
for the first time pulling
a knife on his brother,

1:07:44.146 --> 1:07:45.981
and oh, that's intriguing.

1:07:46.081 --> 1:07:50.085
There's some potential there
to be a companion predator.

1:07:50.186 --> 1:07:52.854
Then, in the middle
of this poker scene,

1:07:52.954 --> 1:07:55.090
you can see he has been
on his mind.

1:07:55.191 --> 1:07:57.759
There's a shot where
he's sort of staring longingly

1:07:57.859 --> 1:08:01.430
at Louis while Louis is shining
his business acumen,

1:08:01.530 --> 1:08:02.931
and he goes,
"I'm gonna show him.

1:08:03.031 --> 1:08:03.999
I'm gonna give him
a little insight

1:08:04.099 --> 1:08:05.767
about what I can do.

1:08:05.867 --> 1:08:07.269
These men look down on you.

1:08:07.369 --> 1:08:09.705
I find it appalling
how men like yourself

1:08:09.805 --> 1:08:11.273
are treated
in this country.

1:08:11.373 --> 1:08:15.311
So he does a little vampire
parlor trick, as it were.

1:08:15.411 --> 1:08:18.980
I believe there is great
opportunity in this city,

1:08:19.080 --> 1:08:23.585
but to see that, I'll need
protection from the wolves.

1:08:23.685 --> 1:08:25.053
[Bangs table]

1:08:25.153 --> 1:08:27.456
Jones: There is a sort
of predator angle to this.

1:08:27.556 --> 1:08:30.626
Louis fully admits later
I was being hunted.

1:08:30.726 --> 1:08:32.328
Lestat would not see that.

1:08:32.428 --> 1:08:34.830
Lestat would say
I was courting him.

1:08:34.930 --> 1:08:35.964
Lestat: Come to me, Louis.

1:08:36.064 --> 1:08:37.466
That take Louis to a place

1:08:37.566 --> 1:08:40.569
where he find the church
is the only place he can go.

1:08:40.669 --> 1:08:43.805
Help me, please.
He's in my head, Father.

1:08:43.905 --> 1:08:47.476
Lestat has entered his mind,
heart and soul,

1:08:47.576 --> 1:08:50.178
and he wants it out and he's
feeling great regret.

1:08:50.279 --> 1:08:52.648
I laid down
with the devil.

1:08:52.748 --> 1:08:54.383
Help me!

1:08:54.483 --> 1:08:58.654
I am weak,
and I want to die.

1:08:58.754 --> 1:09:00.922
He just pours it out,
screaming to a God

1:09:01.022 --> 1:09:03.659
he hasn't talked to
in a long time.

1:09:03.759 --> 1:09:05.861
[Gasps]

1:09:05.961 --> 1:09:07.363
[Screams]

1:09:07.463 --> 1:09:12.167
Lestat has a very different idea
about organized religion.

1:09:12.268 --> 1:09:13.168
[Grunts]

1:09:13.269 --> 1:09:15.537
This charlatan!

1:09:15.637 --> 1:09:18.340
Do you not see
how unworthy he is?

1:09:18.440 --> 1:09:20.809
How could you humiliate
yourself like this?!

1:09:20.909 --> 1:09:22.878
We are catching Lestat
at a very vulnerable

1:09:22.978 --> 1:09:25.514
and emotionally
out-of-control moment,

1:09:25.614 --> 1:09:27.649
and he takes it out
on these two priest

1:09:27.749 --> 1:09:32.788
in front of Louis and then has
to make a very, very

1:09:32.888 --> 1:09:38.026
quick and aggressive 360 and try
to really give the big pitch.

1:09:38.126 --> 1:09:41.663
I can swap
this life of shame,

1:09:41.763 --> 1:09:44.165
swap it out
for a dark gift

1:09:44.266 --> 1:09:47.369
and a power you can't
begin to imagine.

1:09:47.469 --> 1:09:49.505
He manages to pull it off --

1:09:49.605 --> 1:09:53.642
the idea of being seen,
the idea of him being loved.

1:09:53.742 --> 1:09:57.579
Be my companion, Louis.

1:09:57.679 --> 1:10:00.081
Be all the beautiful things
you are.

1:10:00.181 --> 1:10:04.185
And despite the barbaric scene,
as he says,

1:10:04.286 --> 1:10:06.522
he got him at the right moment.

1:10:06.622 --> 1:10:09.925
*

1:10:10.025 --> 1:10:12.561
Louis: And we set there
for some time

1:10:12.661 --> 1:10:16.932
in throes
of increasing wonder.

1:10:17.032 --> 1:10:18.334
The end.
