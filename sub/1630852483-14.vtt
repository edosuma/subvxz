[Episode 14: Domo]

00:26.920 --> 00:28.890
[Making a plan regarding
what one wishes to achieve]

00:37.500 --> 00:40.040
[But I am not the only one with feelings.]

00:40.200 --> 00:43.240
Lord Yi-eon adores me
as much as I adore him.

00:43.540 --> 00:45.710
You only scolding me for it

00:46.370 --> 00:48.640
seems quite unfair.

00:51.580 --> 00:53.180
Never have I ever...

00:53.720 --> 00:56.220
What on earth did I just hear?

00:56.990 --> 01:00.520
That little mouse came in here
with her big eyes

01:00.690 --> 01:02.120
to patronize me.

01:10.300 --> 01:12.500
She is not the only one at fault though.

01:13.030 --> 01:15.740
My grandson is

01:16.400 --> 01:20.039
the world's biggest knucklehead.

01:42.800 --> 01:43.870
Nice.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.150
-Grandmother.
-Were you in the kitchen again?

02:02.450 --> 02:04.390
I heard you came by,

02:05.020 --> 02:06.450
so I made fruit jelly for you.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.120
As if I would fall for that!

02:20.300 --> 02:21.800
It needs more honey.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.110
And starch.

02:26.140 --> 02:27.240
Follow me inside.

02:29.110 --> 02:30.150
Yes, Grandmother.

02:32.850 --> 02:33.780
You were the lookouts!

02:33.850 --> 02:36.550
-We did not have the time to--
-Enough!

02:36.620 --> 02:38.320
-Just put it on.
-Put it on him.

02:38.390 --> 02:39.950
Here you go.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.290
Serve us some tea.

02:47.829 --> 02:49.000
Unbelievable.

02:49.230 --> 02:51.230
I hope Madam Cho gives him the cane again.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.470
We should get her one that will hurt.

02:54.070 --> 02:57.440
How can one sleep
when one's mind is clouded?

03:05.680 --> 03:08.350
How is it that your room is such a mess?

03:08.520 --> 03:11.950
I have told you countless times
that being neat and tidy

03:12.020 --> 03:13.620
will lead to clear paths.

03:18.590 --> 03:21.400
I did not expect you
to come by unannounced.

03:22.060 --> 03:23.300
And so often, might I add.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.430
When will you get married?

03:27.440 --> 03:29.340
-That is out of the blue.
-Is it?

03:29.540 --> 03:32.270
You are employed
and have been earning a living,

03:32.370 --> 03:34.610
so it is about time
you ended your bachelorism.

03:34.710 --> 03:36.710
This mess of a room

03:36.780 --> 03:39.950
should have its own bedding for newlyweds.

03:40.010 --> 03:41.280
But...

03:42.079 --> 03:45.050
You told me to choose between
the state exam and marriage,

03:45.120 --> 03:46.390
so I chose the former.

03:46.650 --> 03:50.290
Lord Kim's and Lord Park's grandsons
married ages ago

03:50.360 --> 03:53.900
and have been gifting their elders
with healthy great-grandchildren.

03:53.960 --> 03:56.130
How long are you willing to take?

03:56.200 --> 03:59.500
But their grandsons never passed
the state exam with the top score.

04:02.570 --> 04:04.140
The inspector general's daughter

04:04.610 --> 04:08.340
is very wise, beautiful, and composed.

04:09.310 --> 04:11.010
And she likes food,

04:11.350 --> 04:13.350
so I believe she is a good match for you.

04:15.380 --> 04:19.649
Grandmother, the Crown Prince
has not been back for long.

04:19.950 --> 04:22.260
Hence, I must assist him
as it is my duty--

04:22.320 --> 04:24.060
You have no such duty.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.500
Your Royal Highness.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.400
Do not use me as an excuse.

04:46.080 --> 04:50.590
I think he is
the most handsome crown price in history.

04:50.820 --> 04:53.920
They must have picked him
based on his looks.

04:53.990 --> 04:55.190
Yes, I agree.

04:55.520 --> 04:59.690
Then who do you think is more handsome?
Our master or the Crown Prince?

05:02.030 --> 05:03.100
Me.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.900
Go away, darn you!

05:10.170 --> 05:11.810
Can you please not tell jokes like that?

05:11.940 --> 05:14.480
You? No, it is me.

05:14.540 --> 05:18.780
♫ Me! It is me ♫

05:20.820 --> 05:23.820
It is an unacceptable act of unfilial
disobedience, Your Royal Highness.

05:23.890 --> 05:26.390
A fifth-generation only son
is refusing to wed.

05:26.450 --> 05:29.860
He is announcing that he does not care
about continuing the family name.

05:30.890 --> 05:34.460
His Royal Highness said
that nothing in the world

05:34.530 --> 05:36.760
is worth giving up one's life for.

05:38.570 --> 05:39.730
I did say that.

05:40.230 --> 05:41.270
Is that so?

05:41.640 --> 05:45.610
Then what will you do about my life
that I sacrificed to raise you?

05:47.780 --> 05:48.909
Good point.

05:49.280 --> 05:52.880
Men use morals and rules
to make women sacrifice everything,

05:53.180 --> 05:56.450
yet they value their own lives so much.

05:57.350 --> 05:59.720
Will you say something,
Your Royal Highness?

06:03.520 --> 06:04.660
You are in the wrong.

06:05.290 --> 06:07.760
You are in the wrong, in every sense.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.600
-Your Royal Highness.
-Equating marriage

06:11.670 --> 06:13.630
with giving up your life

06:13.700 --> 06:16.270
is an exaggeration
which is so typical of Joseon men.

06:16.570 --> 06:18.270
Your wife's support and care

06:18.510 --> 06:20.510
could help you
become even more successful.

06:20.980 --> 06:24.110
Women are always the ones
who sacrifice more.

06:24.180 --> 06:26.050
My point, exactly.

06:27.650 --> 06:29.880
Please let me know
when it is time to select his bride.

06:30.220 --> 06:31.790
I would like to
see the candidates as well.

06:32.220 --> 06:34.020
Will you kindly join me?

06:35.260 --> 06:37.690
Until then, I will do my best

06:39.460 --> 06:41.400
to tame this stubborn,
strong-willed young man.

06:45.770 --> 06:48.400
We have many ash trees outside.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.200
Please feel free use the branches
as a switch.

06:50.870 --> 06:52.510
That is an excellent idea.

07:00.250 --> 07:01.780
Do you need a hand?

07:01.850 --> 07:03.080
Go away.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.050
But I...

07:09.620 --> 07:12.390
Do I pluck the eggplant at the top?

07:15.430 --> 07:16.760
Can I just pluck it?

07:20.600 --> 07:21.800
Such insolence.

07:21.870 --> 07:25.170
How dare you turn your back
on the Crown Prince?

07:25.440 --> 07:29.110
We shall see how long you can go
without talking to me.

07:30.280 --> 07:33.850
Must I summon my bodyguards
and teach you a lesson?

07:33.920 --> 07:34.920
Goodness.

07:36.980 --> 07:38.950
We are grown men now.

07:39.020 --> 07:41.390
Must you still tease me
and pull pranks on me like a child--

07:43.390 --> 07:44.860
Why did you have to throw a tantrum?

07:45.330 --> 07:47.730
If a nobleman's daughter
is willing to marry you,

07:47.800 --> 07:49.630
just be grateful and welcome her
with a deep bow.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.200
If you refuse to wed,

07:52.500 --> 07:54.470
who will bear me a niece or nephew?

07:58.570 --> 08:00.980
That darn niece or nephew.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.780
He is at it again.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.580
We made a pact never to wed,

08:08.150 --> 08:10.350
but then you went ahead and got married.

08:11.390 --> 08:12.520
Traitor.

08:13.420 --> 08:15.390
You are such a fool.

08:16.890 --> 08:19.530
How will you survive
if you listen only to me?

08:20.090 --> 08:21.430
What will you do without me?

08:21.500 --> 08:24.930
I bet you will outlive me
by at least 5,000 years.

08:25.430 --> 08:28.400
They feed you all sorts of
rare, delectable delicacies in the Palace.

08:43.049 --> 08:47.220
Anyway, you must heed my advice, Yi-eon.
Do you understand?

08:49.160 --> 08:51.490
Do not blindly obey everything I tell you.

08:52.030 --> 08:55.100
Learn how the world works and be flexible.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.930
And learn to rely on people other than me.

09:03.270 --> 09:05.310
By the way, what is for dinner?

09:07.380 --> 09:08.740
Why would you ask me that

09:08.810 --> 09:11.480
when you have an entire kitchen
in the Palace that cooks just for you?

09:11.550 --> 09:13.950
What can I do? The food that you make
tastes so much better.

09:14.550 --> 09:16.220
Actually, how about

09:16.920 --> 09:19.250
you become my official taste tester?

09:20.290 --> 09:22.620
I bet no one in Joseon has taste buds

09:22.790 --> 09:24.330
as sensitive as yours.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.760
How can I take a job
that is meant for a court lady?

09:28.630 --> 09:30.830
Right. That is such a pity.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.600
You would be perfect for the job.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.510
Well, help me with these red beans first.

09:40.040 --> 09:43.110
I cleared my schedule for the day
to spend time with you.

09:43.180 --> 09:45.280
So will you not return to the Palace?
Can you please return?

09:45.710 --> 09:48.480
I will not go anywhere
until I get to eat your food.

09:48.550 --> 09:50.590
I have not cooked anything,
Your Royal Highness.

09:56.090 --> 10:00.330
That girl is right about everything.

10:06.900 --> 10:07.800
Grandmother...

10:08.070 --> 10:09.000
Grandmother?

10:13.610 --> 10:16.340
On Dano, young men and women
from across the country

10:16.410 --> 10:17.810
gather by the swings to find dates.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.450
Why are you stuck in your room?

10:19.510 --> 10:20.880
Grandmother, please...

10:21.850 --> 10:23.620
Do not sit around and waste my food.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.320
Go and find me a granddaughter-in-law,
you brat!

10:26.390 --> 10:28.390
-Grandmother.
-You say no

10:28.460 --> 10:29.890
to blind dates and even to matchmakers.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.290
You cannot always do what you want to do.

10:32.360 --> 10:35.500
There are times when you have to
do things that you do not wish to do!

10:36.300 --> 10:38.930
Grandmother! Do not lose your dignity.

10:39.670 --> 10:42.100
Please be graceful.
We can talk it out, okay?

10:42.400 --> 10:44.540
I am the only one
who does not have a granddaughter-in-law!

10:44.870 --> 10:47.840
All other noblewomen
have granddaughters-in-law,

10:47.910 --> 10:49.510
but I do not!

10:49.580 --> 10:51.250
Just give up.

10:51.480 --> 10:54.420
Some people are suited for marriage,
and some are not.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.920
Then does it suit you
to sit around, do nothing,

10:57.990 --> 10:59.850
and just eat all day?

11:01.520 --> 11:03.790
He always digs his own grave like this.

11:03.860 --> 11:06.190
-Bring me a granddaughter-in-law.
-He will get used to the beating.

11:08.430 --> 11:11.300
I am the only one
who does not have a granddaughter-in-law!

11:11.370 --> 11:12.670
-That hurts.
-Let me go in.

11:12.730 --> 11:16.140
Grandmother. Will beating me
suddenly make me want to wed?

11:17.970 --> 11:19.670
-No...
-Fine.

11:20.140 --> 11:24.110
Then I shall beat you
until you find a woman you like.

11:24.210 --> 11:26.450
Grandmother. Wait!

11:28.850 --> 11:30.750
I cannot just go out
and meet someone I like.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.220
It is not something I can control.

11:32.290 --> 11:34.990
Then go bring home a widow or something!

11:35.190 --> 11:38.390
I will not care as long as you like her!

11:38.460 --> 11:39.790
Grandmother, please!

11:43.100 --> 11:46.100
I never imagined
he would bring home a divorcee.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.670
Kkot-dan.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.610
Kkot-dan, are you outside?

11:53.670 --> 11:55.080
Yes, my lady!

11:59.010 --> 12:00.280
Did you call for me?

12:01.220 --> 12:06.020
Find out everything you can
about Kim Jo-yi.

12:06.390 --> 12:07.890
Kim Jo-yi?

12:08.120 --> 12:11.190
Yes. The girl in Yi-eon's room who...

12:12.760 --> 12:16.960
Right. They were so lovey-dovey together.

12:18.170 --> 12:20.870
Yes. Anyway,

12:21.440 --> 12:23.940
find out where she lives
and what she does.

12:24.170 --> 12:28.380
Find out anything and everything
about that girl.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.350
-Do you understand?
-Yes, my lady.

12:36.680 --> 12:37.720
Oh, dear.

12:44.290 --> 12:46.260
Did I say too much?

12:46.730 --> 12:48.630
I should have just let her talk
and quietly listened.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Why did I have to talk back?

12:51.500 --> 12:55.470
No. Still, marriage is...

12:55.870 --> 12:57.870
It is...

13:02.480 --> 13:04.210
You fool, Kim Jo-yi.

13:05.180 --> 13:06.980
Why can you not hold back?

13:07.050 --> 13:09.850
-This is why everyone calls me--
-Rowdy.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.930
Would you like some tea, lovely lady?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.630
Yes. I would love some,
handsome gentleman.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.140
Here.

13:33.210 --> 13:35.410
-I want this one.
-Sure. This is more expensive.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.850
-Oh, then I want that one.
-No, you cannot.

13:38.010 --> 13:39.380
-Too late.
-My gosh.

13:39.450 --> 13:41.220
-Come on.
-No way.

13:41.820 --> 13:42.850
Give it to me.

14:18.550 --> 14:19.650
Wow.

14:23.990 --> 14:25.190
Did anything catch your eye?

14:26.090 --> 14:28.930
-Seung-ryul!
-If something did, I will buy you

14:29.100 --> 14:31.400
everything from that end to this end.

14:31.970 --> 14:33.100
In your dreams.

14:33.730 --> 14:36.570
Forget it. Jade hairpins
are too good for people like us.

14:36.740 --> 14:38.340
Why? It is not.

14:38.470 --> 14:41.180
It is only people who discriminate
against us, not hairpins.

14:41.880 --> 14:42.880
How much is it?

14:42.940 --> 14:45.210
Stop it. This?

14:45.310 --> 14:47.880
I will only sell this
to the wife of a government official.

14:47.980 --> 14:49.780
Take a look at the cheaper ones.

14:51.250 --> 14:52.790
How embarrassing.

14:52.990 --> 14:54.620
I knew you would get rejected.

14:55.490 --> 14:56.860
If I pass the low-class civil exam,

14:56.620 --> 14:59.130
[Chwijae: Low-class civil exam]

14:56.990 --> 14:59.190
I will be able to buy you a bucket of--

14:59.260 --> 15:02.960
By that time,
I would have become a grandma.

15:03.260 --> 15:05.670
Seeing you roam around
the market says it all.

15:07.070 --> 15:09.800
If I pass the low-class civil exam
and buy you this hairpin,

15:12.540 --> 15:13.870
will you marry me?

15:27.090 --> 15:30.190
If you really pass the exam,

15:32.490 --> 15:34.530
I will give it a thought.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.100
I shall get going.

15:38.870 --> 15:40.870
What if I really pass the exam?

15:41.100 --> 15:42.500
Just you wait, Kim Jo-yi!

15:45.610 --> 15:48.010
Do not even dare.
The wife of a government official.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.380
Go after her.

15:52.050 --> 15:54.150
Stop it.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.260
What are you going to do?

16:08.860 --> 16:11.400
-What?
-You and Lord Yi-eon.

16:12.070 --> 16:13.930
What about it?

16:14.100 --> 16:16.970
A nobleman can never get married

16:17.040 --> 16:20.340
to a divorcee. That is an unwritten law.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.480
A divorcee is
prohibited from remarrying by law.

16:24.380 --> 16:25.450
You already know that.

16:27.450 --> 16:30.080
If Lord Yi-eon announces to marry you,

16:30.420 --> 16:32.290
not only Lord Yi-eon's grandmother,

16:32.450 --> 16:34.590
but also the scholars of this country
will rise up in protest.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.290
Public appeals will be made nationwide,

16:36.390 --> 16:40.230
and Confucian scholars will protest
about the customs in front of the palace.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.730
Public appeals and protests?

16:43.860 --> 16:44.970
Correct.

16:46.830 --> 16:50.000
Seung-ryul,
what I want with Lord Yi-eon is--

16:50.070 --> 16:52.740
So I gathered all knowledge

16:52.810 --> 16:55.210
a lawyer could possibly gather

16:55.310 --> 16:58.210
and interpreted all laws
carried out in this country.

16:58.510 --> 17:01.350
There is only one way you and Lord Yi-eon

17:02.220 --> 17:03.320
can officially get married.

17:07.390 --> 17:10.589
File a lawsuit against Lord Yi-eon
using seubcheob.

17:11.829 --> 17:14.329
Have the people who were there

17:14.400 --> 17:16.730
back when the seubcheob happened
to stand witness

17:16.859 --> 17:18.700
and file a lawsuit against Lord Yi-eon.

17:19.069 --> 17:22.040
Then he has no choice
but to accept you as his wife

17:22.140 --> 17:23.970
under moral principles.

17:24.040 --> 17:27.040
And so, you and Lord Yi-eon

17:27.369 --> 17:29.140
can officially get married.

17:30.810 --> 17:32.410
[I told you to stop!]

17:34.720 --> 17:36.220
What is going on? Who are you?

17:36.280 --> 17:37.690
What?

17:37.890 --> 17:40.520
[There is an institution in which
the first man to come across the divorcee]

17:40.650 --> 17:44.020
[standing in front of the shrine
has to take her as his wife in Joseon.]

17:44.160 --> 17:46.390
This is called seubcheob.

17:46.460 --> 17:49.100
Not going through with seubcheob
should be fine.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.770
How dare you! Violating moral principles
is a serious crime!

17:54.870 --> 17:56.300
If you wish,

17:57.400 --> 17:59.170
I will help with your lawsuit.

18:00.970 --> 18:03.480
But that will be a rocky path.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.750
Jo-yi, I do not wish to see you suffer.

18:14.150 --> 18:15.190
Jo-yi.

18:16.520 --> 18:19.530
How about living a happy life with me?

18:46.450 --> 18:48.290
Do not bother.

18:50.720 --> 18:53.130
You are good at your job, Seung-ryul.

18:53.190 --> 18:55.830
You went the extra mile for something
I did not even ask for.

18:56.730 --> 19:00.400
I can totally get why you are the lawyer
with the highest winning rate.

19:02.500 --> 19:06.410
But I do not intend to accept that hairpin

19:06.540 --> 19:08.880
nor file a lawsuit.

19:12.310 --> 19:15.920
So go do your business someplace else.

19:16.180 --> 19:17.450
Understood?

19:22.660 --> 19:24.060
I totally lost.

19:24.190 --> 19:26.430
So why did you get carried away?

19:27.030 --> 19:28.160
I did not.

19:28.760 --> 19:29.860
Look.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.570
I even packed my stuff to leave
if you turned me down.

19:34.270 --> 19:35.370
Really?

19:37.840 --> 19:39.570
I am going on a business trip.

19:40.370 --> 19:43.010
Rumors about me must have spread overseas.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.650
A client made a request.

19:45.180 --> 19:46.650
I knew it.

19:46.980 --> 19:49.020
But it is only natural
with how good you are at your job.

19:50.080 --> 19:51.790
I might be away for a long time.

19:51.920 --> 19:54.250
Got it. Have a safe trip.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.860
Do not skip any meals and stay healthy.

20:00.430 --> 20:02.300
Do not lose your temper so easily.

20:04.730 --> 20:05.870
And do not cry.

20:08.470 --> 20:10.700
Gosh, is it not a business trip?

20:10.770 --> 20:12.710
Enough with the grand farewell.

20:12.870 --> 20:13.970
Get going.

20:16.410 --> 20:17.540
You go ahead.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.480
Okay, I will.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.590
Get me some silk clothes as a souvenir.

20:59.820 --> 21:01.960
What is that luggage next to you?

21:04.760 --> 21:08.030
I am going to Ganghwa Island
for an investigation.

21:08.730 --> 21:12.530
You came back alive not too long ago,
but you are leaving already?

21:13.100 --> 21:14.700
And were you not demoted?

21:14.770 --> 21:17.940
Can I not persuade you
to stop investigating this case?

21:18.210 --> 21:21.480
I am in charge of this case,
and it is a case I must wrap up.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.280
I will take extreme caution.

21:27.180 --> 21:28.220
Fine.

21:28.480 --> 21:31.290
I will not get involved in your work.

21:31.850 --> 21:32.920
However,

21:33.790 --> 21:36.290
marriage is a family business.

21:36.390 --> 21:37.760
So do as I say.

21:38.060 --> 21:41.330
Do not say a word.
Get married to the lady I decide on

21:41.430 --> 21:43.730
by the end of this year. You must.

21:44.030 --> 21:45.830
-Understood?
-Grandmother.

21:46.370 --> 21:47.770
Marriage is solely my business.

21:47.900 --> 21:51.310
If you do not wish to marry,
then stop seeing that girl.

21:51.970 --> 21:53.970
Why on earth are you seeing Jo-yi

21:54.070 --> 21:56.640
if you have mixed feelings about marriage?

21:57.180 --> 21:58.910
Marriage does leave me
with mixed feelings,

21:59.180 --> 22:01.880
but Jo-yi does not.

22:04.550 --> 22:07.090
What about her?
Are her feelings definite as well?

22:08.120 --> 22:11.790
I heard she was with another man
up until a while ago.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.570
Do not tell me you put a tail on her?

22:20.530 --> 22:21.640
I did.

22:23.200 --> 22:26.910
I need to know what kind of person she is
to come to a conclusion.

22:27.070 --> 22:28.340
That was a great idea.

22:29.610 --> 22:32.580
If you keep watching her,

22:32.850 --> 22:34.350
you will no doubt start to adore her.

22:36.950 --> 22:38.090
Grandmother.

22:38.690 --> 22:41.660
I know how much you care about me.

22:42.190 --> 22:46.090
But I am determined not to marry.

22:47.730 --> 22:48.960
And if you still force me to

22:49.830 --> 22:51.900
in spite of it all,

22:53.170 --> 22:54.230
I will get married.

22:56.900 --> 22:57.970
I will marry Jo-yi.

22:59.410 --> 23:02.680
These are the only two options I have
when it comes to marriage.

23:03.510 --> 23:04.850
I will either stay single

23:05.950 --> 23:08.250
or take Jo-yi as my wife.

23:10.050 --> 23:12.620
Those are the only two options for me.

23:18.030 --> 23:21.130
I will now head off to Ganghwa Island.

Be careful with those.

Just when it was starting
to seem like home...

24:20.250 --> 24:21.690
This is upsetting.

24:23.060 --> 24:24.720
We are also the people of this nation,

24:25.790 --> 24:27.660
but we are mistreated

24:28.300 --> 24:30.960
for being dragged away
and then coming back.

24:33.830 --> 24:35.770
We will leave without looking back.

24:41.610 --> 24:43.640
Take what we have at the butcher's

24:43.710 --> 24:46.250
and trade them in at the market.

24:46.580 --> 24:48.580
Food will be preferred.

24:49.180 --> 24:51.050
Sure. Will do.

24:51.520 --> 24:53.920
You should rest while I sort things out.

Sure.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.740
I am glad you came by.

25:11.810 --> 25:14.470
A job came in
and I was hoping to get a hold of you.

25:14.540 --> 25:15.510
Really?

25:15.580 --> 25:17.910
A minister's servant came by

25:17.980 --> 25:19.450
and ordered an outfit

25:19.510 --> 25:21.650
for the young master
from the best seamstress around

25:21.720 --> 25:23.650
saying that price is not an issue.

25:23.850 --> 25:26.090
It is you I have awaited.

25:26.150 --> 25:27.620
I am grateful.

25:27.690 --> 25:29.390
Work your magic then.

-Of course.

Is that doable?

A pocket on the inside?

25:47.470 --> 25:50.840
Yes, that is what he usually orders.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.050
It is a rush order

Is that possible?

Of course.

Yes, the front gate is not far from here.

Oh, that. The client wanted socks
with pockets inside the leg.

-Peculiar, is it not?
-A pocket on a sock?

27:08.790 --> 27:11.260

has been worrying me.

I am not sure.

Of course. I lived in the mountains,

Seung-ryul, is that you?

31:26.280 --> 31:28.550
Yes, it is Seung-ryul from Yeowool Valley.

31:31.820 --> 31:33.390
Have you been well?

31:34.350 --> 31:36.420
Yes, I have.

31:38.190 --> 31:39.860
The air is fresh out here.

31:41.460 --> 31:44.200
Rather than standing here,
we should head inside--

31:44.260 --> 31:47.000
No, that is all right.
I do not mind being outdoors.

31:47.330 --> 31:48.370
I see.

31:54.040 --> 31:55.140
Goodness me.

32:01.850 --> 32:03.850
Your cooking is as good as always.

32:05.490 --> 32:08.120
I hear you became a lawyer.

32:08.790 --> 32:10.060
So you know.

32:11.120 --> 32:14.660
Then you must also know
how Jo-yi is doing as well.

32:15.060 --> 32:18.030
I have not heard about her
ever since I disowned her

32:18.100 --> 32:19.330
during my last visit.

32:20.630 --> 32:22.040
You disowned her?

32:22.100 --> 32:25.340
I will be leaving shortly, you see.

32:27.310 --> 32:30.610
I am nothing but a burden to her.

32:36.380 --> 32:38.820
You will not have to worry
when it comes to Jo-yi.

32:39.190 --> 32:41.720
I am sure she will be fine on her own.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.090
She has already made a name for herself
as a seamstress

32:44.160 --> 32:46.190
and clients are getting in line
to book her.

32:46.260 --> 32:48.560
Friends keep her company now,

32:48.630 --> 32:49.730
and...

32:51.400 --> 32:54.630
she has a man in her life
who adores and protects her.

32:56.800 --> 33:00.670
He is Junior Sixth Counselor Ra
of the Office of Special Counselors.

33:01.210 --> 33:02.810
They met while he was dispatched
to Chungcheong Province

33:02.880 --> 33:04.380
as a secret royal inspector.

33:04.480 --> 33:06.750
And I believe he still keeps her close.

33:09.720 --> 33:10.850
[Why?]

33:11.480 --> 33:13.120
Are you going to live as Sea Goblin?

33:15.090 --> 33:16.960
The Office of Special Justice
is looking for this.

33:17.020 --> 33:19.190
[Gunpowder Sales]

33:20.290 --> 33:24.130
That is why Jo-yi had that ledger.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.640
I came to see you today

33:29.000 --> 33:30.570
for that reason.

33:32.610 --> 33:35.840
Lord Yi-eon is
currently investigating a case

33:35.910 --> 33:37.310
that involves Park Tae-seo, the traitor.

33:40.650 --> 33:44.020
Hence, I came to ask a favor of you.

33:46.220 --> 33:49.360
Is your decision to leave
truly the best solution for Jo-yi's sake?

33:49.790 --> 33:52.590
Or would it be better for her
if you decided to stay

33:52.660 --> 33:53.930
and assisted with the investigation?

33:54.230 --> 33:55.860
Please think about it just once more.

33:59.100 --> 34:03.070
I can no longer be her suitor
since she now has Lord Yi-eon by her side,

34:03.940 --> 34:05.570
but as her longtime friend,

34:06.570 --> 34:09.610
I wish to be of help to her,
and that is why I came to see you.

34:16.449 --> 34:17.850
Please think about it.

34:33.170 --> 34:35.400
So he left nothing behind?

34:35.969 --> 34:37.270
Anything will do.

34:37.340 --> 34:39.510
Anything related to Ra Yong-kyun.

34:39.870 --> 34:43.780
All that we have left are the straw shoes
that he used to wear.

34:44.710 --> 34:46.580
Then could we take a look at those shoes?

34:47.150 --> 34:48.650
The straw shoes? What for?

34:48.820 --> 34:50.750
We should take a look, just in case.

34:50.850 --> 34:52.820
-Please give me a moment.
-Sure.

35:00.990 --> 35:02.160
I see it.

35:04.460 --> 35:05.430
I have a feeling

35:05.730 --> 35:07.770
-that he is here.
-Okay.

35:07.900 --> 35:08.940
Here?

35:09.840 --> 35:11.240
-We should hurry.
-Okay.

35:20.110 --> 35:22.550
Excuse me. May I ask you something?

35:22.680 --> 35:23.680
What?

35:24.450 --> 35:26.090
Gwang-soon.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.320
-Yuk-chil.
-Jo-yi.

35:28.420 --> 35:31.060
-Bi-ryeong!
-What? Goo-pal?

35:31.420 --> 35:32.930
What are you doing here?

35:32.990 --> 35:35.500
Lord Yi-eon sent us here

35:35.560 --> 35:36.760
to collect evidence.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.460
What about you, Gwang-soon?
Why are you here?

35:38.800 --> 35:41.970
I am looking for my father.

35:48.570 --> 35:49.880
What is it?

35:53.110 --> 35:55.150
By any chance, is your father's name...

35:55.350 --> 35:58.080
-Ra--
-Is his name Ra Yong-kyun?

35:58.580 --> 36:00.420
Yes, that is correct.

36:02.260 --> 36:04.590
How do you know my father's name?

36:36.160 --> 36:37.490
At the time,

36:38.560 --> 36:42.460
I just thought
my father was losing his mind.

36:42.730 --> 36:44.460
One and a half don of musk.

36:44.630 --> 36:46.070
Radix sophorae flavescentis, two don.

36:45.330 --> 36:46.400
[Musk, Radix Sophorae Flavescentis]

36:46.570 --> 36:48.300
Aconite, four don.

36:48.370 --> 36:51.340
Musk, 1.5 don. Radix sophorae
flavescentis, 2 don. Aconite, 4 don.

36:51.500 --> 36:54.110
Radix sophorae flavescentis, 2 don.
Aconite, 4 don.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.510
How much longer will you go on like this?

36:59.310 --> 37:02.480
Father, please pull yourself together.

37:03.050 --> 37:04.280
Stop this, please.

37:04.350 --> 37:07.390
Gwang-soon,
my prescription was never wrong.

37:07.690 --> 37:09.720
I put in
the exact amount of angelica roots

37:09.890 --> 37:11.760
-and aconite--
-The Crown Prince...

37:17.030 --> 37:20.270
The Crown Prince is already dead.

37:20.670 --> 37:23.900
Why are you still going on about this?

37:24.170 --> 37:26.110
If the neighbors were to hear...

37:26.370 --> 37:28.210
Gosh, Father. That must not happen.

37:28.340 --> 37:31.140
-Father, please--
-It was not me!

37:32.550 --> 37:35.110
Someone poisoned the Crown Prince.

37:35.680 --> 37:36.880
-Father.
-Why else

37:36.950 --> 37:39.150
would such a thing be found
in his herbal decoction?

37:39.220 --> 37:40.490
Do not say such a dreadful thing.

37:40.850 --> 37:43.120
What if people think it is true?

37:43.490 --> 37:45.420
Father, please stop this.

37:45.560 --> 37:47.490
Gwang-soon, you must leave at once.

37:47.560 --> 37:49.500
I am afraid you would end up
in danger too.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.200
-Father, please...
-Go!

37:51.260 --> 37:52.630
-Leave at once.
-Snap out of it.

37:52.700 --> 37:54.800
-You must leave!
-Where am I to go?

37:54.870 --> 37:57.770
-You must leave at once!
-No, Father. I will be fine.

37:57.840 --> 38:00.410
-You must leave...
-I will be okay.

38:00.470 --> 38:01.540
Father.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.710
Do not worry. I will be okay, Father.

38:08.580 --> 38:12.320
So what my father said was all true.

38:26.870 --> 38:29.240
So who did it?

38:30.100 --> 38:31.970
Who dared to harm the Crown Prince

38:34.740 --> 38:35.880
and my father?

38:37.740 --> 38:38.880
Who was it?

38:41.110 --> 38:42.250
It was Park Tae-seo.

39:00.470 --> 39:02.340
-Gwang-soon.
-Do not worry. I am fine.

39:02.670 --> 39:03.800
I am okay.

39:05.770 --> 39:06.770
I am fine.

39:19.790 --> 39:24.020
What... What do you mean?

39:24.490 --> 39:25.620
I...

39:27.890 --> 39:30.730
I have done something horrible,
Young Master.

39:33.430 --> 39:34.870
"Young Master"?

39:35.740 --> 39:37.270
Why would you call me that?

39:40.210 --> 39:41.310
Mother.

39:53.920 --> 39:55.760
I know that I was very young back then,

39:57.590 --> 39:59.560
but I remember your face, Mother.

39:59.630 --> 40:00.790
No.

40:01.730 --> 40:02.930
No.

40:03.900 --> 40:06.030
I am not your mother, Young Master.

40:06.700 --> 40:10.070
If you are being like this
out of guilt for leaving me as a child,

40:10.900 --> 40:13.910
please know that I do not resent you,
Mother.

40:14.010 --> 40:15.010
I...

40:16.110 --> 40:17.310
I...

40:18.540 --> 40:21.780
I swapped you with my son.

40:43.940 --> 40:46.570
It is a boy, my lord.

40:47.040 --> 40:48.610
What? I have a son?

40:49.340 --> 40:52.450
My gosh, thank you.

40:54.780 --> 40:56.320
It is a boy, my lord.

40:58.320 --> 41:00.750
I do not care about an offspring
born to such a lowly servant.

41:01.290 --> 41:03.490
That is not my son.
He is just an illegitimate child.

41:09.130 --> 41:12.800
Does my dear son
have ten fingers and toes?

41:12.870 --> 41:14.030
Does he look like me?

41:14.130 --> 41:16.800
Yes, he does. Congratulations, my lord.

41:17.070 --> 41:19.170
Thank you. Thank you so much.

41:37.560 --> 41:39.760
I am sorry. I am so sorry...

41:49.670 --> 41:50.800
I could not

41:51.670 --> 41:52.770
let my poor son

41:53.870 --> 41:57.410
live a disdainful life
as an illegitimate child.

42:32.810 --> 42:33.850
Young Master.

42:35.010 --> 42:36.080

42:52.570 --> 42:57.470
[Tavern]

42:55.030 --> 42:56.500
Goodness.

42:56.570 --> 43:00.210
Judging by your face, you must have
suffered severe seasickness.

43:01.840 --> 43:02.940
Ma'am.

43:03.680 --> 43:07.450
What is the most famous
and delicious food here?

43:07.510 --> 43:10.350
All we have here is gukbap.

43:11.750 --> 43:14.020
Then a bowl of it, please.

43:14.090 --> 43:15.090
Sure.

43:22.490 --> 43:26.700
Here you go. Eating something warm
will make you feel better.

43:26.770 --> 43:28.570
Enjoy.

43:34.070 --> 43:35.670
[It is too bland.]

43:48.420 --> 43:49.760
[Now that is what I am talking about.]

43:50.760 --> 43:52.960
-How exhausting.
-Goodness.

43:53.030 --> 43:54.660
-Welcome.
-Gosh, I am worn out.

43:54.730 --> 43:56.860
-Hello.
-Welcome!

43:57.100 --> 43:58.830
-Goodness.
-Sit over there.

43:59.430 --> 44:01.830
Ma'am, we will have some gukbap.

44:01.900 --> 44:03.470
Okay, two bowls of gukbap coming right up.

44:03.540 --> 44:05.500
That reminds me.

44:06.070 --> 44:08.710
-Have you heard what happened to Gokdu?
-What?

44:09.010 --> 44:11.710
Listen. The leader of the Gokdu Guild

44:11.780 --> 44:14.080
was arrested for being involved
in a conspiracy.

44:14.150 --> 44:15.950
So everything was blown to shreds.

44:16.020 --> 44:19.080
No wonder the guild
was nowhere to be seen.

44:19.150 --> 44:20.950
So that is why it was torn down.

44:21.020 --> 44:23.960
But it was not the soldiers who did it.

44:24.020 --> 44:27.290
Was it the Chief State Councilor
from Hanyang?

44:27.590 --> 44:30.460
Someone of high status had it knocked down

44:30.530 --> 44:33.000
to build a vacation home for his son.

44:33.070 --> 44:35.970
Goodness. I cannot believe
that such a successful guild

44:36.040 --> 44:38.170
vanished into thin air overnight.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.670
Nobody can predict the future.

44:40.740 --> 44:44.110
[Does that mean Park Seung
already took over Ganghwa Island?]

are they not?

and trade at Ganghwa Island.

45:01.130 --> 45:03.060
[Sea Goblin]

45:04.330 --> 45:05.730
[There must have been someone]

on Ganghwa Island.]

45:26.050 --> 45:27.090
Park Tae-seo!

45:36.100 --> 45:37.200
I must go.

45:45.200 --> 45:46.770
You are coming with me to Hanyang.

45:47.710 --> 45:50.510
I must go to my father.
I have something to tell him.

45:57.250 --> 45:58.780
I said I must go!

46:31.120 --> 46:32.680
I cannot just let you go.

46:32.890 --> 46:34.950
I said, out of my way!

47:47.230 --> 47:48.290
Gosh.

Jo-yi.

47:57.140 --> 47:58.440
Is that not by today?

48:02.470 --> 48:03.540
Go deliver it.

48:04.480 --> 48:06.210
I will look after Gwang-soon.

48:06.810 --> 48:08.150
Can I really?

48:10.120 --> 48:11.380
You made a promise.

48:12.650 --> 48:14.120
You should maintain your credibility.

48:16.690 --> 48:18.460
Then I will make it quick.

48:25.600 --> 48:27.130
-I am off.
-Be careful.

48:32.770 --> 48:33.840
Goodness.

48:41.810 --> 48:44.350
I am here to deliver the socks I made.

Come in.

49:00.930 --> 49:02.940
Please wait here for a moment.

49:28.230 --> 49:29.490
Gosh.

49:29.560 --> 49:32.000
-Dad!
-You will get hurt, my son.

49:33.070 --> 49:36.270
Dad, I am in total bliss.

49:36.340 --> 49:40.670
I am too if you are.

49:47.610 --> 49:48.650
Do-soo.

49:51.850 --> 49:53.320
For such a long time,

49:54.790 --> 49:57.160
I wanted to be acknowledged by my father.

49:59.790 --> 50:01.290
I am the legitimate son.

50:04.360 --> 50:05.700
Not Do-soo.

50:08.400 --> 50:09.500
I am...

50:11.100 --> 50:12.440
the legitimate son.

50:15.570 --> 50:17.110
The babies were switched.

50:22.050 --> 50:24.120
If father finds out
Do-soo and I were switched,

50:27.790 --> 50:29.390
I wonder what he will say.

50:34.160 --> 50:36.660
That does not change your past.

50:40.670 --> 50:43.640
No amount of anger,
regret, and resentment...

50:47.110 --> 50:48.470
will undo...

50:50.410 --> 50:52.180
what happened.

51:14.970 --> 51:16.900
If you truly wish to change,

51:20.210 --> 51:21.470
there is only one way.

51:47.070 --> 51:48.730
I did not serve it.

51:52.200 --> 51:53.640
It was probably Do-soo.

52:10.560 --> 52:12.060
Bring it forth and sit with me.

52:22.500 --> 52:25.240
Come closer and look at it all you want.

52:31.280 --> 52:33.680
Land and water are connected

52:34.250 --> 52:38.080
and together they are in
the shape of a sphere.

52:39.650 --> 52:41.120
If the opportunity arises,

52:42.120 --> 52:45.360
I would like to visit
all these different countries.

52:48.360 --> 52:50.700
Unfortunately though,
I am all but getting stronger.

52:53.170 --> 52:54.700
Who knows?

52:55.600 --> 52:56.940
There might be a country out there

52:58.140 --> 53:00.140
where its people are treated as equals.

53:05.140 --> 53:06.180
Could...

53:07.780 --> 53:11.580
Could such a country possibly exist?

53:13.390 --> 53:14.420
I do not know.

53:15.850 --> 53:17.920
But would there not be
at least one out there?

53:19.460 --> 53:20.690
But if there is not,

53:22.490 --> 53:25.000
maybe Joseon could be the first.

53:36.780 --> 53:39.110
I apologize for my silly remark.

53:42.410 --> 53:43.450
Your Royal Highness.

53:45.820 --> 53:46.950
Forgive me,

53:47.650 --> 53:50.260
but I believe I confused your dosage.

53:50.720 --> 53:53.390
Allow me to bring you another batch.

53:56.700 --> 53:57.830
It is all right.

54:23.620 --> 54:24.990
Forgive me, Father.

54:25.820 --> 54:28.590
I did not follow your orders
and made a mistake.

54:29.560 --> 54:30.830
You coward.

54:34.230 --> 54:37.040
Dad, I handled the problem.

54:42.270 --> 54:43.540
He seemed to enjoy it.

54:50.120 --> 54:52.250
Gosh. What did I tell you, Dad?

54:52.320 --> 54:53.950
I knew Tae-seo could not do it.

54:58.360 --> 55:01.960
But the last thing I wanted
was to get blood on your hands.

55:06.500 --> 55:07.730
You imbecile.

55:08.400 --> 55:10.870
Your incompetence

55:11.000 --> 55:13.040
led to Do-soo getting his hands dirty.

55:13.910 --> 55:15.510
Useless brat.

55:16.570 --> 55:19.240
Get out of this house!

55:41.070 --> 55:42.170
So tell me.

55:42.770 --> 55:45.470
Did anybody perhaps see you?

55:45.640 --> 55:47.610
Thanks to all the planning
you did beforehand,

55:47.670 --> 55:50.910
I did not even need to write my name down
at the Medical institution.

55:52.280 --> 55:54.610
My dear boy.

55:54.750 --> 55:56.850
My sweet boy.

55:58.220 --> 56:00.750
You are as bold and brave as your old man.

56:00.820 --> 56:03.390
-Of course.
-My sweet boy.

56:03.760 --> 56:04.860
Goodness.

56:05.960 --> 56:07.890
My dear boy.

56:31.220 --> 56:32.280
You are right.

56:35.220 --> 56:36.590
I have wronged people.

56:39.420 --> 56:41.230
I have committed too many sins.

56:43.130 --> 56:44.330
And just like you said,

56:46.200 --> 56:47.700
I will receive my punishment.

56:50.540 --> 56:52.370
I will confess to all my crimes.

56:57.780 --> 56:59.810
I will make my way to Hanyang
with my friends.

57:20.430 --> 57:22.700
It is a written promise
with Park Seung's seal.

58:13.720 --> 58:15.250
[Could I be...]

58:16.290 --> 58:18.860
[at Lord Park Seung's residence?]

58:27.500 --> 58:34.410
[Park Seung]

58:27.970 --> 58:30.170
[You will keep silent
about what you saw and heard]

58:30.400 --> 58:33.610
[and cooperate in delivering
the herbal decoction to the Crown Prince.]

58:55.830 --> 58:57.960
[Underage actors were managed with care.]

59:10.610 --> 59:13.040
[We thank Lee Jun-hyuk and Cha Hak-yeon
for their special appearance.]

59:13.210 --> 59:15.780
[Secret Royal Inspector Joy]

59:16.280 --> 59:19.050
[The evidence Lord Yi-eon
risked his life to obtain...]

59:19.120 --> 59:21.690
[The first benefactor
was the late Crown Prince.]

59:21.850 --> 59:24.190
[Are you Lord Ra Yi-eon?]

59:24.390 --> 59:25.490
[That is what was in
the herbal decoction.]

59:25.560 --> 59:27.590
[To reveal the truth about
the Crown Prince being poisoned...]

59:27.660 --> 59:29.660
[Wherever you are,
I wish you good health.]

59:29.730 --> 59:31.160
[Mother, Father.]

59:32.700 --> 59:36.230
[There's a silly rumor going around
that your son is possessed by a ghost.]

59:36.330 --> 59:38.070
[Taking lives as a pastime]

59:38.140 --> 59:39.900
[is what made ghosts haunt you.]

59:39.970 --> 59:42.140
[I will receive the order
to arrest Park Seung.]

59:42.270 --> 59:43.340
[Let us move out.]
