Long, long ago
deep in the forest

00:08.099 --> 00:12.039
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.060 --> 00:16.219
They called themselves Smurfs.
They were good.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.170
[music continues]

00:22.129 --> 00:26.129
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:26.149 --> 00:27.219
He was bad.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.050
Oh, I hate Smurfs!

00:31.140 --> 00:33.219
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

I ever do!

I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry.

(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there.

00:47.049 --> 00:51.060
And if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.079 --> 00:53.140
And if you are good,
you may just

00:53.159 --> 00:56.219

of the Smurfs.

of smurfball after a picnic.

Yeah. Catch.

01:12.230 --> 01:15.150

the picnic part.

02:07.069 --> 02:09.229
But, Krang, the sun shields
are not ready

02:10.008 --> 02:12.050
and we cannot face
the daylight without them.

02:12.069 --> 02:14.159
We are too few to work
on the shields

02:14.180 --> 02:16.050
and feed the fire.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.039
Don't worry.

Is it too late?

02:32.129 --> 02:36.050
No, just...too full.

02:36.069 --> 02:39.050
Oh, it must've been
all the nuts I ate

02:39.069 --> 02:42.060
or those smurfberries,
or maybe the forest mushrooms

02:42.079 --> 02:45.170
or the wild onions or maybe
it was the sunflower seeds.

- Greedy, stop.

02:47.170 --> 02:50.180
- You're making us sick.
- I hate sick.

and I'll smurf up

gonna eat again.

10:51.220 --> 10:53.129
What is that?

10:54.230 --> 10:57.009
[music continues]

11:01.190 --> 11:04.029
The light, it's gone.

11:05.070 --> 11:08.129
Uh, and so are
all our Smurf slaves.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.220
Not yet, they haven't.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.120
[Smurfs cheering]

11:14.200 --> 11:16.059
(Smurfette)
Not again.

11:16.080 --> 11:18.110
Help. They've got us again.

11:18.129 --> 11:20.110
[Smurfs screaming]

11:20.129 --> 11:23.009
Smurfs, dig in.
Dig in.

11:23.029 --> 11:25.000
- 'We are. We are.'
- 'We are. We are.'

11:25.019 --> 11:28.159
Pull, trolls.
They're all ours now.

11:28.179 --> 11:31.019
[laughing]

11:31.039 --> 11:33.059
[instrumental music]

11:36.220 --> 11:38.100
No!

11:38.120 --> 11:40.090
[trolls screaming]

11:41.169 --> 11:43.019
[shattering]

11:43.039 --> 11:45.139
Ah, the master crystal.

11:45.159 --> 11:47.049
It was useless anyway

11:47.070 --> 11:49.019
now that the Smurfs know
our secret.

11:49.039 --> 11:52.029
Start digging.
We must retreat deeper.

11:52.049 --> 11:55.110
We can never come this close
to the surface again.

11:55.129 --> 11:57.179
Argh! More digging.

11:57.200 --> 12:00.080
And no slaves to help us.

12:00.100 --> 12:02.169
Less talk, more work.

12:02.190 --> 12:04.070
[instrumental music]

12:04.090 --> 12:06.149
Well, it still makes
an okay mirror.

12:06.169 --> 12:09.049
(Clumsy)
'But it doesn't show
dreams anymore.'

12:09.070 --> 12:11.090
(Smurfette)
'Well, I dreamed
of a new game with it.'

12:11.110 --> 12:14.000
- Ready, Hefty?
- Okay, Smurfette.

12:14.019 --> 12:16.179
Here it goes.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.019
(Hefty)
'Strike.'

12:18.039 --> 12:20.190
- 'Hey, let me play.'
- 'It's my turn.'

12:20.210 --> 12:22.070
[Smurfs clamoring]

12:23.179 --> 12:26.019
Ooh, Papa Smurf.
Wanna play?

12:26.039 --> 12:28.169
No, I have
too much work to do.

12:28.190 --> 12:32.019
But we'll all play
after your work is done.

12:32.039 --> 12:33.080
Now, run along.

12:33.100 --> 12:35.190
- Yes, Papa Smurf.
- Yes, Papa Smurf.

12:38.059 --> 12:40.190
[instrumental music]

12:43.149 --> 12:44.190
(Papa Smurf)
'Strike.'

12:44.210 --> 12:47.000
[all laughing]

12:47.019 --> 12:50.000
Well, all work and no play

12:50.019 --> 12:52.110
makes Papa a dull Smurf.

12:52.129 --> 12:55.100
[all laughing]

13:00.009 --> 13:02.129
[theme music]
