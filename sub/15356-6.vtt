00:51.378 --> 00:53.927
Oh, Kim Na Na...
It's a good thing you're here.

00:53.928 --> 00:55.707
No matter how I make my coffee,
I can't make it the way you do.

00:55.708 --> 00:57.257
Can you make me a cup of coffee?

00:57.258 --> 00:59.407
Lee Yoon Sung.

00:59.408 --> 01:02.537
Oh, our contract ended.

01:02.538 --> 01:05.437
Then just tell me how you make it.

01:05.438 --> 01:07.738
Lee Yoon Sung.

01:07.848 --> 01:11.607
Who gave you permission to keep meddling
in my life whenever you want?

01:11.608 --> 01:14.988
Who do you think you are to buy my house?

01:15.478 --> 01:19.437
Do you feel sorry for me?
Am I that pitiful?

01:19.438 --> 01:20.907
Can you say it so I understand
what you're talking about?

01:20.908 --> 01:23.937
My house...
I heard you bought it.

01:23.938 --> 01:27.138
And you had the title
transferred to your name quickly, too.

01:27.198 --> 01:29.562
Did you really want to show off
how wealthy you are to a girl...

01:29.563 --> 01:32.347
who lives in constant fear of being evicted?

01:32.348 --> 01:36.737
How pitiful must I have looked, what with
all my odd jobs, scraping by through life...

01:36.738 --> 01:38.078
Kim Na Na.

01:38.578 --> 01:42.387
Isn't it my right to choose whether or not
to buy a house with my own money?

01:42.388 --> 01:44.817
Why do I have to be questioned by you?

01:44.818 --> 01:47.527
You have your own house
and a very nice one at that!

01:47.528 --> 01:49.677
Money shouldn't be left idle.
It should always be rolling.

01:49.678 --> 01:51.867
That's my father's theory.

01:51.868 --> 01:56.167
Your house is really old and rundown.

01:56.168 --> 01:59.807
But you're the person who first told me
that the house was going into auction.

01:59.808 --> 02:01.937
When I saw it,
I realized it's close to the Blue House

02:01.938 --> 02:05.837
and I'll make a huge profit
on my investment, if it's ever rebuilt.

02:05.838 --> 02:07.807
Why do I have to give that up?

02:07.808 --> 02:10.526
Then you're really going to live
in that house?

02:10.526 --> 02:11.227
Yes.

02:11.228 --> 02:12.597
You're going to leave that nice house...

02:12.598 --> 02:15.397
to live in a house in a horrible
neighborhood, that's about to collapse,

02:15.398 --> 02:17.947
where you have to use washing bins
to catch leaks whenever it rains?

02:17.948 --> 02:19.138
Yeah.

02:19.488 --> 02:23.447
You will purposely leave your house
to suffer in that old house?

02:23.448 --> 02:24.867
Does that make sense?!

02:24.868 --> 02:27.278
How many times do I have to tell you?

02:27.488 --> 02:30.577
I was going to ask you
to vacate the place soon anyway.

02:30.578 --> 02:32.678
When do you plan to move out?

02:35.348 --> 02:39.207
Kim Na Na, be a little more honest.

02:39.208 --> 02:42.498
Didn't you come to beg me to let you
keep living there a little longer?

02:43.728 --> 02:46.347
Then plead your case nicely,

02:46.348 --> 02:48.957
And maybe Iâ€™ll change my mind.

02:48.958 --> 02:53.968
It's not fun if you get all
argumentative.

02:57.568 --> 03:01.217
Lee Yoon Sung, you're the one
who seems to have misunderstood.

03:01.218 --> 03:04.507
It seems you bought that house
to reign over me,

03:04.508 --> 03:06.717
but that will never happen.

03:06.718 --> 03:09.407
Because to me,
people who play with love through money...

03:09.408 --> 03:12.727
are jerks to the bone.

03:12.728 --> 03:16.298
I'll move out of there
so meet me after work.

03:38.038 --> 03:39.268
What?

03:40.558 --> 03:44.157
Humans are the type of beings
who make mistakes as they live, right?

03:44.158 --> 03:46.718
Just get to the point.

03:47.248 --> 03:52.117
I heard you brought me home last night
and I didn't get to say thank you.

03:52.118 --> 03:55.628
All right, I've accepted your thanks,
so what's your point?

03:55.808 --> 04:00.857
I didn't make any mistakes last night,
right?

04:00.858 --> 04:03.248
I blacked out so...

04:05.498 --> 04:06.897
You don't remember anything?

04:06.898 --> 04:08.028
Nothing?

04:08.538 --> 04:12.838
Nope, except one thing...

04:13.928 --> 04:18.947
I think there was a girl next to you
last night.

04:19.848 --> 04:22.577
Oh, you remember that?

04:22.578 --> 04:27.107
It's not Shin Eun Ah by any chance, right?

04:27.108 --> 04:29.398
Shin Eun Ah?

04:30.018 --> 04:33.457
Oh, nothing!

04:33.458 --> 04:36.658
That's what you wanted to verify?

04:37.358 --> 04:38.527
Let's just get to work.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.787
- Hold on.
- What again?

04:40.788 --> 04:42.227
I really didn't make any mistakes, right?

04:42.228 --> 04:45.988
Yeah, you did!
A lot of them, too!

04:46.918 --> 04:50.058
Man, what do I do?

04:57.578 --> 04:59.948
<i>Agent Kim Na Na.</i>

05:01.058 --> 05:03.388
Agent Kim Na Na.

05:04.318 --> 05:06.637
We have to guard candidate Seo Yong Hak.

05:06.638 --> 05:10.097
If we don't leave now,
we'll be late for our shift.

05:10.098 --> 05:12.248
Then let's go.

05:32.478 --> 05:36.908
You keep sighing.
Did something happen?

05:37.638 --> 05:40.638
No, nothing happened.

05:45.098 --> 05:46.327
<i>That's the person.</i>

05:46.328 --> 05:47.997
He put a gun to my head...

05:47.998 --> 05:51.178
and said that if I want to live,
I must get off the bus instantly.

05:51.428 --> 05:53.387
Both Lee Kyung Wan and Seo Yong Hak...

05:53.388 --> 05:56.847
were both shot at and kidnapped
at the same time.

05:56.848 --> 05:59.958
Could these be schemes
plotted by a terrorist group?

06:00.038 --> 06:01.017
North Korea?

06:01.018 --> 06:04.187
I heard these two
have been friends for decades.

06:04.188 --> 06:06.447
Then could it be that person,
the City Hunter?

06:06.448 --> 06:07.977
I don't think so.

06:07.978 --> 06:11.377
To deliver the man to the Prosecutor's
Office, then try to kill him after?

06:11.378 --> 06:12.567
That makes no sense.

06:12.568 --> 06:13.697
That's true.

06:13.698 --> 06:16.717
You had the letter on the Seo Yong Hak case
examined for fingerprints, right?

06:16.718 --> 06:20.297
Yes, but I was told it might take a while
because it contained multiple fingerprints.

06:20.298 --> 06:22.107
Run a comparison
of the fingerprints from the elevator

06:22.108 --> 06:25.157
to the ones from the truck
to the fingerprints from the letters.

06:25.158 --> 06:26.827
Seeing as how these two cases occurred
at such close time periods,

06:26.828 --> 06:28.917
they could both be plotted
by one person or organization.

06:28.918 --> 06:33.727
There were two suspicious people
at the building.

06:33.728 --> 06:38.718
One was either injured or walks funny...

06:38.748 --> 06:40.257
Prosecutor.

06:40.258 --> 06:42.697
That man's movement was a little strange.

06:42.698 --> 06:44.107
His movement?

06:44.108 --> 06:46.647
I thought it was because we were on
a moving vehicle,

06:46.648 --> 06:49.437
but now that I think about it,
how should I explain this?

06:49.438 --> 06:53.328
One of his legs seemed to have a problem.

06:55.848 --> 06:58.576
Investigator Jang, find all Korean residents
between the ages of 40 and 60

06:58.577 --> 07:00.277
who are handicapped with one leg.

07:00.368 --> 07:01.308
Yes.

07:01.318 --> 07:02.377
Investigator Kim.

07:02.378 --> 07:04.917
You said the sniper's gun
was an American made AR -15, right?

07:04.918 --> 07:07.507
Yes, that was the result
of the bullet forensics analysis.

07:07.508 --> 07:09.257
Find out if there is a handicapped person
who came from abroad within the last year,

07:09.258 --> 07:11.977
with more attention towards the US.

07:11.978 --> 07:15.187
Prosecutor,
there are probably a lot of them...

07:15.188 --> 07:18.158
We need to find him
even if we have to work all night!

07:53.268 --> 07:58.908
If ever needed,
this place would be a good place to hide.

08:21.038 --> 08:22.267
Wow. What the heck...

08:22.268 --> 08:27.377
So you want me to cover all the windows
and doors with iron bars?

08:27.378 --> 08:29.657
On a house that may be reconstructed
any day now?

08:29.658 --> 08:30.418
Yes.

08:30.428 --> 08:33.567
Why don't you just make do for now?
It's such a waste of money.

08:33.568 --> 08:37.587
Will you do it or not?
I can give you the money now if you want.

08:37.587 --> 08:41.486
Give me a 50 percent deposit now
and pay me the rest once it's done.

08:41.488 --> 08:43.467
Then please install it now.

08:43.467 --> 08:46.327
Don't worry about the price and use only
the strongest and most reliable materials.

08:46.328 --> 08:49.317
This guy...
Don't you see I'm busy?

08:49.318 --> 08:50.467
I'll have it done tomorrow morning.

08:50.468 --> 08:52.588
Tomorrow morning?

08:52.918 --> 08:54.217
I have to go to work...

08:54.218 --> 08:56.027
You can just leave the keys.

08:56.028 --> 08:59.177
I won't touch anything in the house.

08:59.178 --> 09:00.398
The keys?

09:01.668 --> 09:05.767
Kim Na Na, just live in that house
until I tell you to leave.

09:05.768 --> 09:09.918
I'll just let you stay
since you have nowhere to go.

09:10.858 --> 09:14.608
No, not like that...

09:18.188 --> 09:19.448
Kim Na Na.

09:19.978 --> 09:23.798
I'm sorry about before.

09:24.078 --> 09:30.077
I just bought the place as an investment,
so stay as long as you need.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.568
Okay?

09:34.528 --> 09:35.908
Oh, my God.

09:37.928 --> 09:40.907
I said right after work
and you're right on time.

09:40.908 --> 09:42.587
Are you really that desperate
for this house?

09:42.588 --> 09:44.717
If I wasn't, why would I buy it?

09:44.718 --> 09:45.803
Give me the keys.

09:45.804 --> 09:48.762
You came to get the keys.

09:48.797 --> 09:52.827
Not a penny you've spent goes to waste,
so you'll become wealthy in no time.

09:52.828 --> 09:54.108
Follow me.

09:54.118 --> 09:56.617
I'll pack everything then give you the keys.

09:56.618 --> 09:59.187
No, just give me the keys first.

09:59.188 --> 10:01.287
I will...
I will, okay?

10:01.288 --> 10:05.088
I won't insist on living here
and not give you the keys, okay?

10:07.558 --> 10:08.598
Hey!

10:10.178 --> 10:12.478
Hey, Kim Na Na!

10:48.538 --> 10:50.548
Flower Pretty Boy?

10:50.998 --> 10:53.198
Is she giving this to me?

10:54.168 --> 10:55.837
Why do you touch other people's things
without their permission?

10:55.838 --> 10:57.377
Do I need permission
to touch this little thing?

10:57.378 --> 11:00.238
It's not just a little thing, okay?

11:01.418 --> 11:03.987
A first impression is always right.

11:03.988 --> 11:07.587
I knew the moment I drove your car while you
had a great time with a girl in the back.

11:07.588 --> 11:08.617
Hey, Kim Na Na.

11:08.618 --> 11:11.957
I thought I judged you unfairly, seeing you
helped me with my father's hospital fees...

11:11.958 --> 11:16.308
and how you were with Mi Jin and Do Jin.
But...

11:17.248 --> 11:18.997
Just put your stuff back.

11:18.998 --> 11:21.057
If you need this house, just stay.

11:21.058 --> 11:22.797
Are you joking?

11:22.798 --> 11:25.627
I don't know if you're playing around
because you're wealthy

11:25.628 --> 11:29.377
or if you really bought this
as an investment,

11:29.378 --> 11:32.907
- but since I was seven, this house...
- I know.

11:32.908 --> 11:37.578
It's a house with a table your dad built
and a tablecloth your mom made.

11:38.308 --> 11:41.438
So I'm telling you to stay here!

11:45.358 --> 11:46.388
Here.

11:47.128 --> 11:49.147
Just feed her once a day.

11:49.148 --> 11:53.778
Ddorong is smart. She'll do her business
in the bathroom if you keep the door open.

11:54.448 --> 11:57.607
When I find a place, I'll get
the rest of my things and pick up Ddorong.

11:57.608 --> 12:00.297
You're asking me to live with this dog?
Says who?!

12:00.298 --> 12:03.107
Can't you do at least that much since you're
forcing me to move out with a day's notice?!

12:03.108 --> 12:07.108
It's my choice whether I'll do it for you
or not! I'm the house owner.

12:08.828 --> 12:11.627
Ddorong, even if this ahjussi annoys you,
just put up with it for now.

12:11.628 --> 12:14.308
I'll be back to pick you up soon.

12:16.838 --> 12:21.278
Here are the keys that you wanted so badly.

12:22.998 --> 12:24.568
Hey, Kim...

12:25.288 --> 12:26.458
Kim Na Na.

12:28.478 --> 12:31.477
Did I tell her to leave?

12:31.478 --> 12:33.277
Did I ever brag about being rich?

12:33.278 --> 12:36.477
She's the one who started everything
and got angry about me buying this place.

12:36.478 --> 12:38.779
She lost her temper first!

12:40.248 --> 12:41.538
What am I going to do about her?

13:08.228 --> 13:10.568
Hey, Kim Na Na!

13:15.078 --> 13:18.078
Kim Na Na, wait!

13:31.508 --> 13:33.758
Hey, Kim Na Na!

13:34.428 --> 13:35.977
Stop the bus!

13:35.978 --> 13:37.698
Come out!

13:39.478 --> 13:40.698
Hey!

13:43.708 --> 13:48.108
Wait a minute!

13:51.088 --> 13:52.428
Oh... She...

14:08.108 --> 14:11.237
Dad, why are you so skinny?

14:11.238 --> 14:14.548
Are you upset that I don't visit often?

14:16.188 --> 14:22.138
I've been busy lately.
I was guarding and I almost got shot.

14:22.238 --> 14:26.588
I'm not that bad, huh?

14:27.998 --> 14:31.518
I'm sorry, Dad.

14:32.468 --> 14:38.428
The director says I'm insubordinate
and I don't have the skills to be a guard.

14:39.568 --> 14:42.548
My salary was cut,

14:42.738 --> 14:48.128
and the house was bought by another person.

14:51.788 --> 14:55.508
Dad, what do I do?

14:57.678 --> 15:02.688
My life is a joke right now.

15:03.478 --> 15:06.518
I don't even have a place to sleep.

15:25.588 --> 15:28.798
I survived because of this person...

15:30.508 --> 15:33.208
Because I felt like dying...

15:33.488 --> 15:35.558
It's funny, huh?

16:03.728 --> 16:07.978
<i>Yeah, I'm at Dad's hospital.</i>

16:10.178 --> 16:13.957
I don't know.
It's okay.

16:13.958 --> 16:18.748
Excuse me for a moment.

16:19.848 --> 16:22.428
I'll call you back.

16:25.448 --> 16:27.508
What is it?

16:29.428 --> 16:35.077
This may seem a bit sudden,
but do you see the guy in the back?

16:35.078 --> 16:38.407
He really likes you.

16:38.408 --> 16:40.667
No, don't look now.

16:40.668 --> 16:42.547
He's good looking.

16:42.548 --> 16:44.557
You won't regret it.

16:44.558 --> 16:50.478
Get a cup of coffee with him
or just coolly reject him.

17:04.478 --> 17:05.627
Hello.

17:05.637 --> 17:06.426
What is it?

17:06.428 --> 17:09.667
I heard from your friend,

17:10.948 --> 17:14.458
but I'm sorry, you're not my type.

17:14.667 --> 17:15.867
Excuse me.

17:16.458 --> 17:20.857
Can you give me your friend's number?

17:20.858 --> 17:23.317
He's my type.

17:23.318 --> 17:24.358
What?

17:26.417 --> 17:28.748
What the...?

18:19.608 --> 18:23.147
Hey, you have to be bark
when someone comes in.

18:23.148 --> 18:26.428
How can I entrust Na Na to you
if you're like this?!

18:37.038 --> 18:39.468
What's going on?

18:42.768 --> 18:45.338
What's wrong with this?

18:48.098 --> 18:50.738
What decade is this?

18:53.278 --> 18:56.658
Nothing works here.

19:02.418 --> 19:05.267
Kim Na Na,
why don't you ever let me finish talking?

19:05.268 --> 19:07.414
Why are you so stubborn?

19:09.368 --> 19:11.778
Making people feel sorry...

19:29.618 --> 19:31.908
What the heck?

19:47.218 --> 19:50.042
Ah! Kim Na Na...

20:02.188 --> 20:05.987
Hey! How could you leave the house
in that shape?!

20:05.988 --> 20:09.128
Nothing works!

20:10.208 --> 20:14.057
Raise the house to your standards
or adjust your standards to the house.

20:14.058 --> 20:16.187
Why won't the toilet flush?

20:16.188 --> 20:18.577
Do you have to stick your hand in
every time?

20:18.578 --> 20:20.727
The shower head always falls off.

20:20.728 --> 20:21.960
I turned on cold water for a shower,

20:21.995 --> 20:24.196
but it spewed out water
hot enough to boil me alive.

20:24.198 --> 20:27.968
What do you expect from a building
that has almost been torn down 3 times?!

20:28.608 --> 20:30.677
Don't make me angry so early in the morning.

20:30.678 --> 20:34.328
Let's just pretend we didn't see each other.

20:35.748 --> 20:39.577
Dr. Lee! Good morning!

20:39.578 --> 20:42.687
Wow Dr. Lee,
you're so amazing with this service!

20:42.688 --> 20:45.918
Sorry,
but this coffee belongs to someone else.

20:50.868 --> 20:55.227
Lee Kyung Wan was kidnapped
and Seo Yong Hak was almost shot.

20:55.228 --> 21:01.187
Anonymous letters, hacking,
and a City Hunter on top of that...

21:01.188 --> 21:05.087
Please eat breakfast and then work.
We all need to eat to live!

21:05.088 --> 21:09.007
I bet Seo Yong Hak and even the
City Hunter are eating breakfast right now.

21:09.008 --> 21:11.407
The results from the letter fingerprints
aren't out yet, right?

21:11.408 --> 21:14.087
If the results don't come out soon,
the evidence won't be valid anymore.

21:14.088 --> 21:15.367
Please calm down.

21:15.368 --> 21:20.258
Every time we call the forensics center,
they yell at us that we're rushing too much.

21:20.298 --> 21:21.338
Excuse me.

21:21.758 --> 21:24.527
We found the person who crashed
the servers in the Blue House yesterday.

21:24.528 --> 21:25.343
- You did?
- You...

21:25.378 --> 21:28.467
You mean the one who put up a huge picture
of a military boot riddled with nails?

21:28.468 --> 21:30.227
and crashed all the servers?

21:30.228 --> 21:32.857
But it was a Blue House employee.

21:32.858 --> 21:34.967
From the National Communications Network
Team Office of the Security Service.

21:34.968 --> 21:36.877
That's where experts work.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.627
But the work wasn't that of an expert.

21:38.628 --> 21:41.227
Overloading to hack the system
is an outdated method.

21:41.228 --> 21:44.147
Lee Kyung Wan and that letter writer too...!

21:44.148 --> 21:46.568
- Investigator Kim, please get a warrant.
- Yes, Sir.

21:46.578 --> 21:49.767
Lee Kyung Wan's case, Seo Yong Hak's case,
the military boots and the letters...

21:49.768 --> 21:52.608
They are all related somehow.

21:55.128 --> 21:57.257
I'm Prosecutor Kim Yong Joo
from the Seoul Prosecutor's Office.

21:57.258 --> 21:59.768
Where is Go Ki Joon?

22:00.438 --> 22:02.447
Over there...

22:02.448 --> 22:04.357
What is the problem?

22:04.358 --> 22:07.448
I'm sorry to barge in at this time.

22:07.998 --> 22:09.607
Go Ki Joon.

22:09.608 --> 22:11.487
I'm sure you know why we're here.

22:11.488 --> 22:15.567
You'll have to come with us for breaching
Section 72 of the Securities Exchange Law,

22:15.568 --> 22:16.847
in committing a hack
into the information securities network.

22:16.848 --> 22:18.267
What do you mean he has to go with you?

22:18.268 --> 22:20.288
Investigator Jang.

22:21.418 --> 22:22.528
Let's go.

22:22.558 --> 22:23.458
Huh?

22:23.468 --> 22:24.548
Get up.

22:28.178 --> 22:29.957
Sorry for interrupting.

22:29.958 --> 22:33.527
Wait...
Can you please explain?

22:33.528 --> 22:37.087
The hacking case from yesterday
was traced to Go Ki Joon's house.

22:37.088 --> 22:38.397
The IP address was verified to his house

22:38.398 --> 22:41.327
and the prosecution has opened the case
for further investigation.

22:41.328 --> 22:43.207
The hacking did not cause any harm...

22:43.208 --> 22:44.947
and the servers were down
for merely two minutes.

22:44.948 --> 22:46.457
It's not only for the hacking.

22:46.458 --> 22:49.457
The anonymous letters, the recent shooting,

22:49.458 --> 22:52.267
and the kidnapping seem to be connected,

22:52.268 --> 22:55.278
which is why we obtained
a high priority arrest warrant.

22:57.388 --> 23:02.178
Letters? Shooting? Hacking?!

23:16.828 --> 23:18.768
Na Na.

23:19.678 --> 23:22.067
Your face is healing well.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.517
Thanks to you.

23:24.518 --> 23:26.407
It seems we'll be
running into each other quite often.

23:26.408 --> 23:27.128
Excuse me?

23:27.138 --> 23:29.077
I've been put in charge
of investigating Seo Yong Hak's case...

23:29.078 --> 23:30.717
and I heard
you're responsible for guarding him.

23:30.718 --> 23:31.428
Yes.

23:31.438 --> 23:34.618
Please help me out.

23:37.708 --> 23:40.808
Yes. But wait!
What happened with Go Ki Joon?

23:44.238 --> 23:48.317
I thought Go Ki Joon was odd
the very first time I met him.

23:48.318 --> 23:53.837
He cried while we were sparring
and I thought he was a bit different,

23:53.838 --> 23:56.227
but how could a Blue House employee
hack the Blue House?

23:56.228 --> 23:59.627
Is he a spy like the rumors say?

23:59.628 --> 24:01.247
A spy that the CIA planted?

24:01.248 --> 24:03.647
Does that sound plausible to you?

24:03.648 --> 24:07.287
He's tall but everyone in the Blue House
knows he and Lee Yoon Sung are wimps.

24:07.288 --> 24:08.178
What?

24:08.188 --> 24:09.877
The movies always show it like that!

24:09.878 --> 24:11.408
Disguise.

24:11.438 --> 24:15.047
Maybe that's just part of his disguise to
mislead everyone.

24:15.048 --> 24:18.957
Shooting, letters, hacking!
Those are all big deals!

24:18.958 --> 24:20.877
Thanks to him
there will be more trouble for us.

24:20.878 --> 24:23.037
Now we have to all show our IDs
when we come to work.

24:23.038 --> 24:25.657
Don't even start.
Even the trunk of my car was searched.

24:25.658 --> 24:28.698
We're even restricted to surfing only within
the communications network.

24:28.699 --> 24:29.999
There are now
3 levels of firewall security too.

24:30.078 --> 24:33.107
Why do we all have to suffer
because of one person's mistake?

24:33.108 --> 24:36.678
They should investigate into
a person's background more meticulously.

24:38.718 --> 24:40.507
You shouldn't talk like this!

24:40.508 --> 24:43.017
What are you doing, agent Shin Eun Ah?

24:43.018 --> 24:43.827
What's wrong?

24:43.828 --> 24:48.087
Talking about someone behind his back
is not a polite thing to do.

24:48.088 --> 24:51.487
Even though Go Ki Joon didn't graduate
from a prestigious university,

24:51.488 --> 24:55.567
and he's very clumsy, a little dull
and not very likeable,

24:55.568 --> 24:59.257
but he's not a bad person.

24:59.258 --> 25:02.167
I can attest to that
as his drill instructor.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.527
I find your actions to be wrong,

25:04.528 --> 25:07.247
when you do not know
all the details of the situation.

25:07.248 --> 25:09.147
I'll be going.

25:09.148 --> 25:11.367
Agent Kim Na Na, let's go.

25:11.368 --> 25:14.298
But I didn't finish eating...

25:23.658 --> 25:27.837
So Seo Yong Hak's youngest son
was on the basketball team,

25:27.838 --> 25:31.567
ruptured his ligament
and had surgery done on it.

25:31.568 --> 25:34.958
And now he's in the midst of re-applying
for exemption from the military.

25:35.798 --> 25:37.527
What's wrong with that?

25:37.528 --> 25:40.887
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say,
Sir. It's pretty interesting.

25:40.888 --> 25:41.812
This boy...

25:41.813 --> 25:45.097
went to a growth clinic until high school
senior year and they did a lot of imaging.

25:45.098 --> 25:47.087
Senior year of high school?

25:47.088 --> 25:50.457
I guess his treatment at the clinic worked,
he was able to join the basketball team.

25:50.458 --> 25:51.978
No, no.

25:51.988 --> 25:53.407
He's only about this tall.

25:53.408 --> 25:55.937
It even makes you wonder
how he made it into the basketball team.

25:55.938 --> 25:57.637
It's possible because it's just a club.

25:57.638 --> 25:58.628
So?

25:58.638 --> 26:02.467
But after only a month in college,

26:02.468 --> 26:04.997
he received an exemption from the military
for his ruptured ligament.

26:04.998 --> 26:07.537
We're not doctors, how are we supposed
to decipher these images?

26:07.538 --> 26:08.868
Wait...

26:12.588 --> 26:13.517
Did you find something?

26:13.518 --> 26:17.798
The shape of the leg is different
even though the pictures are similar.

26:18.108 --> 26:20.267
You're saying the shape of his leg changed
that much in a span of a couple of months?

26:20.268 --> 26:22.417
Of course not.

26:22.418 --> 26:23.947
The patients were switched.

26:23.948 --> 26:27.167
He brought these images
of a ruptured ligament to the exam,

26:27.168 --> 26:30.507
and had surgery on a perfectly healthy leg
to get to where he is now.

26:30.508 --> 26:31.357
In other words...

26:31.358 --> 26:33.327
Unquestionable military service corruption.

26:33.328 --> 26:34.658
Bingo.

26:35.048 --> 26:37.667
The former Minister of National Defense
has nothing better to do...

26:37.668 --> 26:40.688
than come up with ploys to get his sons out
of military service?!

26:42.518 --> 26:43.648
You see?

26:43.818 --> 26:46.697
We should have just
taken cared of him that time.

26:46.698 --> 26:51.348
Now that we know everything,
I won't let him get away.

26:51.388 --> 26:55.038
Father, leave everything to me.

27:00.898 --> 27:02.667
Nice to meet you.

27:02.668 --> 27:05.098
Yes. It's nice to meet you.

27:05.258 --> 27:08.208
Hello! It's nice to meet you!

27:09.678 --> 27:11.187
Is your business running okay?

27:11.188 --> 27:12.517
We're getting by.

27:12.518 --> 27:14.128
That's good.

27:15.128 --> 27:17.707
Sir! Sir!

27:17.708 --> 27:18.568
Move!

27:18.578 --> 27:19.527
Sir!

27:19.528 --> 27:20.907
What are you?!
Get out of my way!

27:20.908 --> 27:21.857
Sir!

27:21.858 --> 27:26.328
I told you I have something to say!
Move!

27:33.208 --> 27:36.367
Oh, my back!

27:36.368 --> 27:38.487
This security guard is out to kill!

27:38.488 --> 27:40.077
What are you doing?!

27:40.078 --> 27:42.727
We asked you to guard us,
not show off your Judo skills!

27:42.728 --> 27:46.247
Are you going to take responsibility
if people accuse us of being overprotected?

27:46.248 --> 27:48.037
I'm sorry, I'll be more cautious.

27:48.038 --> 27:49.477
I'm so sorry.

27:49.478 --> 27:51.497
The shooting incident
occurred pretty recently...

27:51.498 --> 27:54.017
so all the guards
are still nervous from that.

27:54.018 --> 27:59.607
I will apologize on their behalf.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

27:59.608 --> 28:02.792
I'm sorry.
He came in such a rush so...

28:02.892 --> 28:04.589
Ah, yes...

28:05.288 --> 28:08.227
What are you doing?
Hurry, accompany this man to the hospital!

28:08.228 --> 28:09.227
Oh, my back!

28:09.228 --> 28:09.957
Are you all right?

28:09.958 --> 28:12.378
- Ow... I feel like I'm going to die.
- Are you okay? Let's get you up.

28:14.628 --> 28:18.407
You can't tell from first glance.

28:18.408 --> 28:22.098
Please work on
honing your natural instincts.

28:53.608 --> 28:56.567
If the reporters find out,
they wonâ€™t write anything good.

28:56.568 --> 29:00.097
What kind of security agent
throws a citizen around in the marketplace?

29:00.098 --> 29:02.937
At a time when every vote is vital.
Goodness.

29:02.938 --> 29:04.017
Even the shooting incident...

29:04.018 --> 29:07.648
Was also the result of the
security agents' negligence.

29:07.668 --> 29:11.247
Ma'am, I'm so sorry for today.

29:11.248 --> 29:14.977
We're doing are hardest to
ensure your safety.

29:14.978 --> 29:18.447
Of course...
That's why you're hired.

29:18.448 --> 29:22.737
Please be cautious so that there is no
unnecessary gossip before the election.

29:22.738 --> 29:25.348
Yes, Ma'am.

29:37.328 --> 29:39.428
<i>Come clean the dog poo.</i>

29:45.558 --> 29:46.977
What's going on?

29:46.978 --> 29:49.908
This...
Clean it up.

29:52.478 --> 29:53.937
I asked you to look after the dog.

29:53.938 --> 29:57.267
You said all I need to do is feed her,
you didn't ask me to pick up her poop.

29:57.268 --> 29:58.987
Taking care of her includes that!

29:58.988 --> 30:00.877
Did you think you could only feed her?!

30:00.878 --> 30:02.717
Then leave me a dog that doesn't poop!

30:02.718 --> 30:07.388
Oh, my God...
I just won't say anything.

30:09.118 --> 30:10.277
You said it's smart.

30:10.278 --> 30:12.677
How could such a smart dog
poop on the floor like this?

30:12.678 --> 30:15.557
I think the dog has trouble holding it in*,
just like its owner. (*short-tempered)

30:15.558 --> 30:17.337
You didn't leave the bathroom door open,
did you?

30:17.338 --> 30:18.467
My Ddorong is smart!

30:18.468 --> 30:20.347
As long as you leave the door open,
she'll do her business in there.

30:20.348 --> 30:22.748
Did you tell me that?

30:25.918 --> 30:27.777
Why are you looking at me like that?

30:27.778 --> 30:31.217
I won't ever clean up dog poo
so come and clean it up yourself every day.

30:31.218 --> 30:33.518
Or take her with you.

30:33.598 --> 30:37.117
You know I have nowhere else to go,
aren't you being too much?

30:37.118 --> 30:39.978
Then just live with me!

30:44.168 --> 30:47.107
Stop joking around!

30:47.108 --> 30:48.207
Who said I'm joking?

30:48.208 --> 30:49.517
If that wasn't a joke,

30:49.518 --> 30:51.367
are you really expecting me
to live together with you?

30:51.368 --> 30:52.727
You're playing with me again, aren't you?!

30:52.728 --> 30:54.667
Hey, the ventilator is broken,
the toilet seat is broken too,

30:54.668 --> 30:56.327
and the shower head falls off
if you breathe on it.

30:56.328 --> 31:00.377
And how can there be not a single channel
on TV? You take responsibility.

31:00.378 --> 31:02.277
What should I take responsibility?

31:02.278 --> 31:04.637
I only bought the house
because I believed it could be redeveloped,

31:04.638 --> 31:06.287
but I realized my investment
was a bad choice.

31:06.288 --> 31:07.697
It's all right if you don't pay rent,

31:07.698 --> 31:09.647
but you have to come over everyday
to cook and clean.

31:09.648 --> 31:12.527
Also, the toilet seat, faucet,
the shower, and the TV,

31:12.528 --> 31:14.327
fix all of them for me.

31:14.328 --> 31:16.277
Also, when you have the money,

31:16.278 --> 31:18.727
according to the auction price I paid,
you can buy it back.

31:18.728 --> 31:21.328
That's what I mean by taking responsibility.

31:21.458 --> 31:24.577
For you, those conditions are quite good.

31:24.578 --> 31:25.917
Do you refuse?

31:25.918 --> 31:28.337
It's not that...

31:28.338 --> 31:30.907
But living under a single roof with a guy...

31:30.908 --> 31:33.477
Ah... a guy and a girl?

31:33.478 --> 31:34.907
Kim Na Na, you're good at judo, right?

31:34.908 --> 31:36.367
You're a 4th Level?

31:36.368 --> 31:38.367
Then, even if I have wayward thoughts
about you,

31:38.368 --> 31:41.117
then I know clearly what you'll do to me,
would I still want to touch you?

31:41.118 --> 31:41.967
Am I stupid?

31:41.968 --> 31:44.827
I clearly know this,
would I go looking for a beating?

31:44.828 --> 31:46.307
It seems that way.

31:46.308 --> 31:50.138
Also, the ultimate deciding factor-
You...

31:50.178 --> 31:52.037
are a B cup, right?

31:52.038 --> 31:55.097
Anything smaller than a C cup,
I don't view as a woman.

31:55.098 --> 31:58.727
Plus, Kim Na Na, don't you dislike me?

31:58.728 --> 32:00.657
Then you won't secretly attack me.

32:00.658 --> 32:04.698
What other problems can there be, right?

32:06.258 --> 32:08.757
It seems you're still quite reluctant.

32:08.758 --> 32:09.577
Then, forget it.

32:09.578 --> 32:11.028
Hold on!

32:11.488 --> 32:13.787
Give me some time to think about it.

32:13.788 --> 32:15.768
All right.

32:29.438 --> 32:32.157
Everything he said is true.

32:32.158 --> 32:35.167
I don't like him
and he doesn't like me either.

32:35.168 --> 32:38.308
So nothing like that would happen.

32:39.948 --> 32:42.758
I don't have a place to go.

32:43.488 --> 32:44.697
I don't have to pay rent either.

32:44.698 --> 32:50.188
He just wants me to cook a little more
and do household chores.

32:57.518 --> 33:01.587
Mom, Dad, till I get this house back,

33:01.588 --> 33:03.497
just till I get this house back,

33:03.498 --> 33:06.028
please close your eyes.

33:19.108 --> 33:20.847
If you don't want to, don't do it.

33:20.848 --> 33:23.067
I won't have any regrets.

33:23.068 --> 33:26.108
All right, let's live together.

33:27.248 --> 33:29.487
But, I have conditions.

33:29.488 --> 33:30.377
Conditions?

33:30.378 --> 33:33.957
You have to sign a contract that says
there will never be any physical contact.

33:33.958 --> 33:35.997
Hey, how many times
do you want me to say it?

33:35.998 --> 33:37.667
You're not my type at all.

33:37.668 --> 33:40.827
You would never ever,
ever be the type that I'd fall for.

33:40.828 --> 33:43.097
I'm just taking precautions.

33:43.098 --> 33:46.848
If, you grab my hand,

33:46.988 --> 33:49.158
50,000 won!

33:49.568 --> 33:51.327
You've gone crazy thinking about money.

33:51.328 --> 33:55.457
Don't worry, if I grab your hand,
I'll give you 50,000 won too.

33:55.458 --> 33:59.278
Then, what if I were to grab your shoulder?

33:59.368 --> 34:01.227
100,000 won.

34:01.228 --> 34:03.317
How about
if I put an arm around your shoulder?

34:03.318 --> 34:04.837
200,000 won?

34:04.838 --> 34:08.087
Then, what if I were to hug you?

34:08.088 --> 34:10.206
300,000 won.

34:10.208 --> 34:11.538
A peck?

34:11.987 --> 34:14.428
500,000 won!

34:15.538 --> 34:19.108
Then, what about a kiss?

34:20.658 --> 34:23.016
1 million won!

34:23.018 --> 34:27.608
1... million... won?

34:28.068 --> 34:29.607
Why are you acting like this,
all of a sudden?

34:29.608 --> 34:32.498
Go over there.

34:34.208 --> 34:37.087
Wow, it takes a lot of money
to be in a relationship with you.

34:37.088 --> 34:37.956
What are you saying?

34:37.958 --> 34:39.447
It's a million won for a kiss,

34:39.447 --> 34:41.777
which guy would want to date you?

34:41.777 --> 34:44.996
No one would be able to afford it,
even if it were a buy one get one free deal.

34:44.998 --> 34:45.858
No...

34:45.868 --> 34:48.266
If one were to prolong the kiss,
then it might be worth it.

34:48.268 --> 34:50.036
Lee Yoon Sung!

34:50.038 --> 34:51.487
Since you've already decided,

34:51.487 --> 34:53.637
then you should go get your stuff.

34:53.638 --> 34:54.628
Oh, right.

34:54.638 --> 34:56.838
The hospital...

34:58.078 --> 35:00.358
Ah, my bag...

35:05.788 --> 35:10.548
Hey, if you keep this up and Boss finds
out, I'll be dead too.

35:10.688 --> 35:12.147
Even so, I feel like Na Na is in danger,

35:12.148 --> 35:13.647
I have to stay by her side.

35:13.648 --> 35:14.838
Na Na?

35:14.848 --> 35:16.327
What's wrong with Na Na?

35:16.328 --> 35:18.037
The guy I encountered while I was pursuing
Lee Kyung Wan

35:18.038 --> 35:20.117
knows Na Na and even where she lives too.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.397
He's not your average guy, it seems.

35:21.398 --> 35:23.677
What will happen
if you're discovered by someone?

35:23.678 --> 35:24.587
Don't worry.

35:24.588 --> 35:27.007
I'll be careful not to let anything slip.

35:27.008 --> 35:30.667
Aigoo, I don't know, no matter how
I think about it, I still feel uneasy.

35:30.668 --> 35:32.707
Ahjussi, just follow my father closely,

35:32.708 --> 35:34.267
if you feel like something's about to slip,
just let me know.

35:34.268 --> 35:37.548
I know, don't worry about me
and take care of yourself.

35:37.688 --> 35:42.267
You, if you dare touch a hair
on Na Na's head...

35:42.268 --> 35:44.717
I already told you my standards
are really high.

35:44.718 --> 35:48.307
But, what is your relationship with Na Na?

35:48.308 --> 35:50.747
No relationship at all.

35:50.748 --> 35:52.287
Shall I pack some side dishes for you?

35:52.288 --> 35:53.767
You can take them and share it with Na Na.

35:53.768 --> 35:56.147
When I was buying fish,
they said it was buy one get one free,

35:56.148 --> 35:57.387
so I bought quite a few.

35:57.388 --> 35:58.137
Just bring some over.

35:58.138 --> 35:59.487
There's also some pickled crab, it's just
pickled nicely, bring everything over.

35:59.488 --> 36:00.777
Am I being married off?

36:00.778 --> 36:03.118
What is this, really...?

36:04.678 --> 36:08.478
Just... if Ahjussi is asking you to take it,
just take it.

36:10.318 --> 36:13.287
Who gets to use the bathroom first?

36:13.288 --> 36:15.107
Of course, I get to use it first.

36:15.108 --> 36:18.007
That way, you can clean it every time.

36:18.008 --> 36:21.247
Then I get to use a clean bathroom everyday.

36:21.248 --> 36:22.138
Oh, right.

36:22.148 --> 36:25.188
You have to clean the dog poop, too.

36:35.738 --> 36:37.408
[Contract]

36:38.418 --> 36:39.968
Kim Na Na.

36:41.028 --> 36:42.187
What?

36:42.188 --> 36:43.807
Do you have anything casual I can wear?

36:43.808 --> 36:45.597
I didn't bring anything to wear to sleep,

36:45.598 --> 36:47.577
the old judo gi was really comfortable
the other time.

36:47.578 --> 36:49.297
What's the use of such a big suitcase,

36:49.298 --> 36:51.507
when you didn't even bring a shirt
you can sleep in.

36:51.508 --> 36:53.008
Hold on.

36:53.368 --> 36:55.277
It's something anyone could forget.

36:55.278 --> 36:57.877
If I had these looks
and was well-prepared too,

36:57.878 --> 37:01.558
it would be too tiring to live.

37:01.898 --> 37:03.148
Ah!

37:03.778 --> 37:05.198
Ah!

37:05.358 --> 37:08.117
Na Na, you have to give me
the belt too. This...

37:08.118 --> 37:10.357
You really don't know how to do things.

37:10.358 --> 37:11.947
I'm going to use this.

37:11.948 --> 37:12.928
Oh!

37:12.938 --> 37:15.338
You can't use that!

37:16.218 --> 37:19.898
- Why? I'll just use...
- I'll get you another one.

37:24.408 --> 37:26.808
Use this one.

37:31.198 --> 37:32.408
[Kim Na Na]

37:41.698 --> 37:44.688
I'm going to use the bathroom!

37:50.078 --> 37:53.068
[Kim Na Na]

37:53.278 --> 37:54.687
<i>Ah! It's so cold!</i>

37:54.688 --> 37:56.317
<i>If you lift the cover up,</i>

37:56.318 --> 37:59.358
<i>you need to put it back down!</i>

38:01.198 --> 38:02.828
Hold on!

38:05.188 --> 38:06.658
Jerk.

38:27.898 --> 38:29.228
Hey.

38:29.568 --> 38:30.598
You...

38:30.608 --> 38:32.237
Why do you wash your hair at night
and not in the morning,

38:32.238 --> 38:33.857
you'll get dust in your hair.

38:33.858 --> 38:35.637
There's so much to do in the morning.

38:35.638 --> 38:38.407
I'm so busy, where can I find the time
to blow dry my hair?

38:38.408 --> 38:40.667
I'm going to bed first.

38:40.668 --> 38:42.938
Hey, this...

38:48.528 --> 38:51.237
It would be nice
if we could watch together.

38:51.238 --> 38:54.168
It's so boring watching by myself.

40:19.168 --> 40:20.688
[Kim Na Na]

40:28.538 --> 40:30.617
<i>Mom, don't leave me by myself!</i>

40:30.618 --> 40:32.298
<i>Mom!</i>

40:33.908 --> 40:35.298
<i>Mom!</i>

40:48.768 --> 40:50.388
Mom.

40:50.748 --> 40:53.308
I'm sorry, Mom.

41:36.558 --> 41:37.827
Are you crazy?

41:37.828 --> 41:40.287
How could you follow right behind me?
What if someone sees you?

41:40.288 --> 41:42.977
Hey, no one cares.
You're the one acting really strange.

41:42.978 --> 41:47.928
I've lived in this neighborhood for
a really long time, everyone recognizes me.

41:47.968 --> 41:49.707
I'll walk towards the market,

41:49.708 --> 41:53.157
count to 20 and walk in the other direction,
understand?

41:53.158 --> 41:54.447
You're going to the market?

41:54.448 --> 41:55.947
Isn't that out of the way?

41:55.948 --> 41:58.337
I'll get on the bus at the earlier stop.

41:58.338 --> 42:02.447
Hey, you seem quite experienced at this.

42:02.448 --> 42:03.987
You're so meticulous.

42:03.988 --> 42:04.888
Who is it?

42:04.898 --> 42:07.087
Keep your voice down, people can hear you.

42:07.088 --> 42:09.688
I asked you who it is!

42:09.908 --> 42:12.978
Count to 20, 20.

42:37.628 --> 42:39.437
I've already summoned
Candidate Seo Yong Hak as a witness.

42:39.438 --> 42:40.807
Have you not been able contact him?

42:40.808 --> 42:42.647
He was admitted into the hospital,
after that he got discharged.

42:42.648 --> 42:45.297
He has a packed schedule
and says it's really difficult to make time.

42:45.298 --> 42:48.358
Are you going to make a trip personally?

42:48.708 --> 42:51.397
I don't have time to meet him today,
I have an appointment.

42:51.398 --> 42:53.427
We'll just reschedule the summoning
of Candidate Seo Yong Hak for tomorrow.

42:53.428 --> 42:55.257
Yes, I will make preparations.

42:55.258 --> 42:56.158
Oh, right.

42:56.168 --> 42:58.527
Hudson of Maris Company is coming to Korea
the day after tomorrow, right?

42:58.528 --> 43:01.208
Yes, that's right.

43:03.278 --> 43:05.048
I'm sorry.

43:05.848 --> 43:08.778
The team is a mess, right?

43:09.098 --> 43:11.987
Would someone who knows how to worry
about the team do something like this?

43:11.988 --> 43:14.367
Why didn't you just tell
the prosecutor honestly?

43:14.368 --> 43:17.107
This wasn't something
that you, Go Ki Joon, did.

43:17.108 --> 43:18.387
I did it, it's true.

43:18.388 --> 43:20.647
We're both professionals,
you can stop lying to me.

43:20.648 --> 43:22.717
Anyone with a smidgeon of hacking knowledge,

43:22.718 --> 43:24.907
wouldn't use that type of method nowadays.

43:24.908 --> 43:28.317
That day, after you drank a little,
you spilt the truth, didn't you?

43:28.318 --> 43:30.277
Go Ki Joon,
after your brother went to the army,

43:30.278 --> 43:31.476
he contracted tetanus

43:31.477 --> 43:35.057
because of his defective boots,
which led to his leg being amputated.

43:35.258 --> 43:37.617
And here I thought it was foolproof.

43:37.618 --> 43:40.537
Tell the truth to the prosecution.

43:40.538 --> 43:44.228
Since I just have to find a new job,
it's fine.

43:45.158 --> 43:47.618
But what about my brother?

43:48.378 --> 43:51.358
That kid really enjoyed taekwondo.

43:53.108 --> 43:55.587
But now his life is over.

43:55.588 --> 43:59.947
His dream was to run a taekwondo school
and teach children.

43:59.948 --> 44:03.068
But just because of those stupid boots
with soles that fall off,

44:03.338 --> 44:05.867
and their refusal to change it,
he ended up with tetanus.

44:05.868 --> 44:07.587
Everyone, including the Board of Inspections
and the Ministry of Defense,

44:07.588 --> 44:10.198
all of them pretended nothing happened.

44:11.878 --> 44:15.378
As his hyung,
I couldn't do anything to help.

44:16.568 --> 44:18.657
Then do as you like.

44:18.658 --> 44:21.527
I don't have a brother,
so I can't really understand.

44:21.528 --> 44:23.787
Life is a matter of choices,

44:23.788 --> 44:26.398
Nothing is forced.

44:51.118 --> 44:55.258
Shouldering this amount of regret,
can get a bit tiresome.

44:57.568 --> 45:00.197
Although it's really a shame
that your leg became this way,

45:00.198 --> 45:01.827
but asking your brother
to take the rap for you,

45:01.828 --> 45:04.147
you're destroying him too. Is that it?

45:04.148 --> 45:07.597
Hyung, won't listen to me.

45:07.598 --> 45:10.018
Do you not have a mouth?

45:10.168 --> 45:12.877
When the incident happened,
Go Ki Joon was at the Blue House.

45:12.878 --> 45:14.897
If the truth is uncovered,

45:14.898 --> 45:17.147
that will prove
that Go Ki Joon testified falsely.

45:17.148 --> 45:19.568
That will definitely be enough.

45:20.838 --> 45:22.307
The issue with the defective boots,

45:22.308 --> 45:25.658
the Public Prosecutor's Office
has already started looking into it.

45:26.338 --> 45:28.047
I think revealing the truth now

45:28.048 --> 45:31.148
might be a good thing
for both of you.

45:46.268 --> 45:48.397
Why are your shoulders so hunched?

45:48.398 --> 45:51.158
Do you not know how to set
your feet wider apart?

45:51.208 --> 45:52.377
Straighten your upper body,

45:52.378 --> 45:53.327
so your two feet are the same
distance apart as your shoulders.

45:53.328 --> 45:54.457
How many times do you want me to repeat it?

45:54.458 --> 45:57.508
How did you ever get your PhD?

46:01.958 --> 46:04.677
How can a man be so easily frightened?

46:04.678 --> 46:07.128
Lower your chin!

46:09.638 --> 46:11.987
Professor Lee Yoon Sung!

46:11.988 --> 46:15.327
Da Hye,
access is restricted to staff members only.

46:15.328 --> 46:16.817
What am I allowed to do then?

46:16.818 --> 46:19.207
You don't let me do anything,
anything.

46:19.208 --> 46:21.017
I want to learn how to shoot too.

46:21.018 --> 46:22.667
It's not that you want
to learn how to shoot,

46:22.668 --> 46:26.348
it's that you want to see Professor Lee.

46:27.648 --> 46:29.707
Wow, that's so cool.

46:29.708 --> 46:30.817
Teach me too!

46:30.818 --> 46:32.907
I want to learn how to shoot too, okay?

46:32.908 --> 46:34.807
Ms. Da Hye, if you really want to, let me...

46:34.808 --> 46:39.247
I hope Professor Lee Yoon Sung can teach me.

46:39.248 --> 46:40.538
Me?

46:42.438 --> 46:45.077
Da Hye, then wear this,

46:45.078 --> 46:47.968
if not, you're going to get hurt.

46:48.388 --> 46:50.908
Unni, thank you!

46:51.548 --> 46:55.157
Wow, wearing this,
don't I look really stylish?

46:55.158 --> 46:55.928
Right?

46:55.938 --> 46:58.688
Stand in the correct position first.

47:01.158 --> 47:02.648
Like this?

47:05.068 --> 47:07.767
Your feet have to be the same distance
as the width of your shoulders.

47:07.768 --> 47:10.077
Like that, like that.

47:10.078 --> 47:11.718
Then?

47:13.278 --> 47:16.157
You have to be focused.

47:16.158 --> 47:18.797
Then your right hand grips that gun,

47:18.798 --> 47:20.637
and your left hand goes over your right.

47:20.638 --> 47:21.908
Aigoo...

47:21.918 --> 47:24.557
Is he good enough to be teaching someone?

47:24.558 --> 47:28.988
After you hold your breath, and focus...

47:30.228 --> 47:33.488
Pull... the trigger.

47:35.228 --> 47:37.237
It's a lot simpler than I imagined!

47:37.238 --> 47:40.627
Don't you know that the more off target
you shoot, the louder the gunshot?

47:40.628 --> 47:43.478
What a show-off.

47:49.698 --> 47:51.837
Wow! It's within the 10 point ring!

47:51.838 --> 47:53.827
I must be naturally talented at shooting!

47:53.828 --> 47:55.677
Can my university entrance exams
include marksmanship?

47:55.678 --> 47:58.568
I would easily be able
to get into Seoul University then.

47:58.888 --> 48:01.707
All this was the work
of Professor Lee Yoon Sung.

48:01.708 --> 48:04.067
Can you teach me one more time?

48:04.068 --> 48:05.267
All right? All right?

48:05.268 --> 48:07.157
- I'm really busy.
- All right? All right?

48:07.158 --> 48:08.737
- Teach me.
- Pull her off me!

48:08.738 --> 48:12.918
Teach me one more time.

48:18.908 --> 48:21.407
You've had a difficult journey.

48:21.408 --> 48:24.648
The representative is waiting for you.

48:28.538 --> 48:30.058
Yoon Sung.

48:30.238 --> 48:32.077
Hudson is here.

48:32.078 --> 48:34.787
Seo Yong Hak's secretary
came to greet him personally.

48:34.788 --> 48:38.458
If we had mistook his arrival time
for tomorrow, we'd have been in big trouble.

48:48.118 --> 48:49.988
Okay, later.

48:51.238 --> 48:52.677
Did a friend arrive from America?

48:52.678 --> 48:53.978
Yes.

48:53.988 --> 48:55.197
If the incident with Go Ki Joon
didn't happen,

48:55.198 --> 48:57.777
you could have let your friend
come visit the Blue House.

48:57.778 --> 48:58.797
How nice would that be.

48:58.798 --> 49:01.397
Who knew Go Ki Joon
would do something like that?

49:01.398 --> 49:04.127
I'm heading out first,
my friend is waiting for me.

49:04.128 --> 49:05.647
Then, of course you have to go see him.

49:05.648 --> 49:08.975
If America asks you to join them,
it's a definite no, no!

49:11.908 --> 49:13.267
You're here so early?

49:13.268 --> 49:14.417
I'm not late, am I?

49:14.418 --> 49:15.777
I can be touched, can't I?

49:15.778 --> 49:17.237
Is this something to be touched about?

49:17.238 --> 49:18.318
Of course.

49:18.328 --> 49:20.907
When we were living together,
wasn't that how it was?

49:20.908 --> 49:23.237
Not fulfilling your promises is a given,

49:23.238 --> 49:26.418
and if you do,
I should be weeping with gratitude.

49:27.888 --> 49:30.517
You don't have to feel sorry.

49:30.518 --> 49:33.267
I bought you that tie for your birthday.

49:33.268 --> 49:34.447
Is that so?

49:34.448 --> 49:35.487
You don't even remember.

49:35.488 --> 49:37.907
Do you remember
you are the one who bought all my ties?

49:37.908 --> 49:38.987
What does that mean?

49:38.988 --> 49:42.848
Have you not gone shopping
since we broke up?

49:44.058 --> 49:45.318
Let's go.

49:53.398 --> 49:56.248
Hi, Hudson.

49:57.288 --> 50:01.218
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.

50:06.858 --> 50:09.097
Recently, there have been
a lot of first year celebrations.

50:09.098 --> 50:12.838
Families usually want to spend
their weekends together.

50:17.888 --> 50:19.877
Emerald Hall...

50:19.878 --> 50:22.648
Which way should we go?

50:27.048 --> 50:28.497
Young Joo...

50:28.498 --> 50:30.247
I'm sorry, Sae Hee, but you go ahead first.

50:30.248 --> 50:31.017
I'll be there in a little bit.

50:31.018 --> 50:33.998
Oh, where are you going...?

50:35.988 --> 50:38.107
Now, this is like Kim Young Joo,

50:38.108 --> 50:41.168
always putting work
ahead of everything else.

50:42.188 --> 50:45.578
Why do I feel hurt again?

50:55.568 --> 50:57.327
Ah, Prosecutor Kim...

50:57.328 --> 50:58.687
What are you doing here?

50:58.688 --> 51:01.297
You've even rejected all of my summons
because of your hospital stay.

51:01.298 --> 51:03.007
What are you doing at a hotel?

51:03.008 --> 51:06.697
I... passed by here during my inspection
of preparations for the press conference,

51:06.698 --> 51:09.227
and I happened to run into someone I know.

51:09.228 --> 51:11.817
But, do I have a duty,

51:11.818 --> 51:14.447
to report everything to you?

51:14.448 --> 51:18.447
Mr. Hudson, I'm Prosecutor Kim,
with the Seoul D.A.'s Office.

51:18.448 --> 51:22.318
Wow, prosecutor, huh?

51:23.008 --> 51:24.297
Prosecutor Kim!

51:24.298 --> 51:27.847
Maris Company
better not make any illegal moves,

51:27.848 --> 51:31.117
or tax violations
in its arms trade with Korea.

51:31.118 --> 51:32.698
Excuse me?

51:32.708 --> 51:34.577
I'm warning you.

51:34.578 --> 51:36.487
Don't look down on Korea.

51:36.488 --> 51:38.847
I'm sorry, but I don't understand
what you're talking about.

51:38.848 --> 51:42.927
Hey, I haven't been coming down hard
on you because you're a friend's son.

51:42.928 --> 51:44.857
But you have to have a limit, stop now!

51:44.858 --> 51:47.357
Even if it's a friend of my father's,
the law is still the law.

51:47.358 --> 51:50.308
I'll see you
at the witness cross-examination.

51:54.608 --> 51:57.827
Is the D.A.'s Office
still investigating you?

51:57.828 --> 52:01.797
A while ago, there was
an assassination attempt on my life.

52:01.798 --> 52:03.947
I knew about that,
but this atmosphere now...

52:03.948 --> 52:08.617
No matter how I look at it, it is because
I gained a fair bit during the elections.

52:08.618 --> 52:12.238
That's why there will always be things
that people want to malign me for.

52:48.528 --> 52:50.007
Ahjussi, hold on.

52:50.008 --> 52:51.877
If they order room service
from Seo Yong Hak's room,

52:51.878 --> 52:54.668
intercept it midway.

53:10.018 --> 53:11.407
It's room service.

53:11.408 --> 53:12.457
We didn't order it.

53:12.458 --> 53:14.237
But an order was placed.

53:14.238 --> 53:17.047
A foreign guest ordered coffee and fruits,

53:17.048 --> 53:19.468
that's why I'm bringing it over.

53:32.928 --> 53:34.498
Come in.

53:36.198 --> 53:38.828
I was right.

54:00.738 --> 54:02.128
Hold on.

54:03.808 --> 54:04.948
What?

54:05.718 --> 54:07.137
Just leave.

54:07.138 --> 54:08.938
All right.

54:13.038 --> 54:14.338
Wait.

54:26.318 --> 54:27.778
Thank you.

54:28.858 --> 54:30.198
Welcome.

54:36.338 --> 54:39.978
Hey, Hudson tipped me 50,000 won.

54:42.518 --> 54:45.927
<i>Didn't you decide that
you will help me sell 30 fighter planes?</i>

54:45.928 --> 54:47.657
<i>But why are you reneging on your decision?</i>

54:47.658 --> 54:49.977
Can you take a look
at the material I prepared?

54:49.978 --> 54:51.168
Here.

54:56.318 --> 54:57.918
Already...

54:57.928 --> 55:00.697
There are defects in the fighter planes
so no one else wants to buy them,

55:00.698 --> 55:03.708
and you want to sell them to us?

55:04.078 --> 55:06.767
Fighter plane crashes
causing the death of a pilot,

55:06.768 --> 55:11.818
in Russia, Georgia, India,
these three countries?

55:11.868 --> 55:15.147
Look here, if we make these purchases
and something goes wrong,

55:15.148 --> 55:17.227
you know exactly what will happen, right?

55:17.228 --> 55:19.237
Even if I become president,

55:19.238 --> 55:22.067
and an issue like this come up, I would be
impeached and removed from office, too.

55:22.068 --> 55:24.037
Then, are you trying to say
you won't help me?

55:24.038 --> 55:26.517
Would you do the same if you were me?

55:26.518 --> 55:29.987
I will report that this deal
has completely fallen through.

55:29.988 --> 55:31.587
What's the rush?

55:31.588 --> 55:34.148
Sit down, sit down.

55:34.928 --> 55:37.447
Can't we just import them?

55:37.448 --> 55:39.427
But I have a condition.

55:39.428 --> 55:43.038
In this transaction, as a handling fee,

55:43.408 --> 55:46.077
I want 20 percent of the profits.

55:46.078 --> 55:47.798
<i>20 percent?</i>

55:48.188 --> 55:52.317
<i>We've never paid such a steep commission
before.</i>

55:52.318 --> 55:56.467
It's better than letting them become scrap
metal because no one buys them, right?

55:56.468 --> 55:57.787
Think about it.

55:57.788 --> 56:00.117
Once I become president,

56:00.118 --> 56:03.997
I will increase the defense spending
and buy more arms.

56:03.998 --> 56:06.257
That's one of the first priorities
in my policies.

56:06.258 --> 56:10.827
If it really happens,
and I become the president of this country,

56:10.828 --> 56:12.857
Maris won't suffer any losses.

56:12.858 --> 56:14.847
Do you understand?

56:14.848 --> 56:16.787
<i>Then, I'll draw up a contract,</i>

56:16.788 --> 56:20.387
stating that when you become president,
you guarantee not to change your mind.

56:20.388 --> 56:21.788
All right.

56:21.798 --> 56:23.157
One more thing.

56:23.158 --> 56:27.287
Now, in order to achieve my goals,
I'm doing a deal with Maris.

56:27.288 --> 56:32.977
But, if I become president,
I will never buy such inferior weapons.

56:32.978 --> 56:33.895
When that time comes,

56:33.896 --> 56:34.896
what we buy from Maris will be
the cream of the crop, with no flaws,

56:37.298 --> 56:39.687
the best weapons.

56:39.688 --> 56:41.098
Why?

56:41.728 --> 56:44.237
Because more than anyone,

56:44.238 --> 56:48.328
I love this country, understand?

56:58.268 --> 57:00.417
To achieve your goals,

57:00.418 --> 57:03.808
you're buying defective fighter planes?

57:04.708 --> 57:07.707
You can never become the president.

57:07.708 --> 57:09.607
The fact that someone like that wants to
become the president, is the problem.

57:09.608 --> 57:12.718
Look at this society.

57:13.108 --> 57:14.857
I didn't think things
had gotten to this level.

57:14.858 --> 57:17.317
Report to Dad
and we'll set the date to take action.

57:17.318 --> 57:21.317
Of course! We have to quickly set the dates
to get rid of this bunch of fellas.

57:21.318 --> 57:22.747
It's enough to just get rid of them.

57:22.748 --> 57:23.667
What's wrong, Ahjussi?

57:23.668 --> 57:26.587
Yoon Sung,
I've already finished what I needed to do.

57:26.588 --> 57:28.027
Can I go home first?

57:28.028 --> 57:29.427
I have something important
to do back at home.

57:29.428 --> 57:30.537
Something important?

57:30.538 --> 57:34.717
The Home Shopping Channel is replaying that
show where the Fat Dad cooks the octopus.

57:34.718 --> 57:37.847
You don't know how delicious it is,
it's sold out everyday. I must get it today!

57:37.848 --> 57:40.147
We should give it a try too, see how
delicious it is, and cook for your dad.

57:40.148 --> 57:43.487
Then, what about the bug
and the hidden camera in the next room?

57:43.488 --> 57:44.787
Of course we should pack it up...

57:44.788 --> 57:48.628
- You do it. Good work!
- Ahjussi... Ahjussi!

58:04.948 --> 58:07.427
Will anything really happen tomorrow?

58:07.428 --> 58:10.787
After that incident,
we can't let our guard down.

58:10.788 --> 58:12.387
The criminal hasn't been caught yet,

58:12.388 --> 58:15.507
we don't know what else they'll do.

58:15.508 --> 58:18.167
Even if we're supposed to be bullet shields,

58:18.168 --> 58:23.448
Are you, Agent Kim, really willing
to block a bullet with your body?

58:24.618 --> 58:25.727
Of course we have to.

58:25.728 --> 58:28.388
Because I'm an agent.

58:29.468 --> 58:33.688
The vents in the ceiling are all checked,
now we just have to check the walls.

58:38.138 --> 58:39.027
Congratulations.

58:39.028 --> 58:41.437
After having given birth to three babies,
you guys are the true patriots.

58:41.438 --> 58:43.517
You guys have to start loving the country,
too.

58:43.518 --> 58:47.637
It's been already been 5 years,
why is there no news yet?

58:47.638 --> 58:48.897
What about Sae Hee?

58:48.898 --> 58:50.137
What did Sae Hee say when she got here?

58:50.138 --> 58:51.218
Sae Hee?

58:51.228 --> 58:55.038
Is Sae Hee here?
I haven't seen her.

59:13.368 --> 59:16.138
[Kim Young Joo]

59:18.598 --> 59:21.218
Dr. Jin Sae Hee.

59:21.448 --> 59:25.838
Oh, it's Lee Yoon Sung.

59:31.518 --> 59:33.318
[Sae Hee]

59:33.928 --> 59:35.247
<i>The number you dialed
is currently unavailable.</i>

59:35.248 --> 59:36.997
<i>We're connecting you to the voicemail.</i>

59:36.998 --> 59:40.618
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

59:40.698 --> 59:42.897
Oh, Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

59:42.898 --> 59:44.497
Na Na.

59:44.498 --> 59:46.287
What are you doing here?

59:46.288 --> 59:47.637
Are you on duty?

59:47.638 --> 59:48.558
Yes.

59:48.568 --> 59:52.307
There's a press conference tomorrow for the
elections, we came earlier to take a look.

59:52.308 --> 59:55.357
Oh, you've become even busier
after the incident.

59:56.658 --> 59:58.977
Oh, right...
Is the investigation going smoothly?

59:58.978 --> 01:00:01.258
<i>Look here.</i>

01:00:02.628 --> 01:00:04.137
Prosecutor Kim.

01:00:04.138 --> 01:00:07.877
Are you even investigating
the agents now?

01:00:07.878 --> 01:00:08.968
No.

01:00:08.978 --> 01:00:13.797
I'm asking how the investigation is going
with the sniper attack.

01:00:13.798 --> 01:00:15.277
Is that so?

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:17.067
With regard to the sniper at large,

01:00:17.068 --> 01:00:19.827
he has a personal vendetta against you,
Sir.

01:00:19.828 --> 01:00:21.677
There are a lot more areas to look into.

01:00:21.678 --> 01:00:25.257
In order for us to wrap the case up quickly,
please offer us your assistance.

01:00:25.258 --> 01:00:26.628
All right.

01:00:26.638 --> 01:00:29.917
The person who is the most curious
about who the sniper,

01:00:29.918 --> 01:00:31.448
is me.

01:00:36.678 --> 01:00:38.037
This is boring.

01:00:38.038 --> 01:00:40.497
You actually came here to drink by yourself?

01:00:40.498 --> 01:00:42.387
Ah, that's right.

01:00:42.388 --> 01:00:43.667
The first year celebration...

01:00:43.668 --> 01:00:45.787
I came here for a first year celebration.

01:00:45.788 --> 01:00:47.937
A first year celebration?

01:00:47.938 --> 01:00:52.467
Although I'm happy to see you,
I have to go to the celebration.

01:00:52.468 --> 01:00:55.257
I've not even given birth to a single child,

01:00:55.258 --> 01:00:58.207
but my friend has already delivered three.

01:00:58.208 --> 01:01:00.617
She got married because of me,

01:01:00.618 --> 01:01:05.448
but she's leading a better life than I,
what a funny friend.

01:01:08.468 --> 01:01:10.767
Oh, I'm sorry.
What should I do?

01:01:10.768 --> 01:01:11.717
No, it's fine.

01:01:11.718 --> 01:01:14.227
You don't have an important appointment,
do you?

01:01:14.228 --> 01:01:17.777
No, my friend is here.
I came to find him.

01:01:17.778 --> 01:01:19.417
I'll go and just get cleaned up.

01:01:19.418 --> 01:01:20.617
Then, let's go together.

01:01:20.618 --> 01:01:22.187
You should take your jacket off,

01:01:22.188 --> 01:01:24.317
and I'll wash it immediately
then return it to you.

01:01:24.318 --> 01:01:25.478
It's fine.

01:01:25.488 --> 01:01:26.807
It seems you're quite drunk.

01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:29.217
You helped me the other time
when I was in trouble,

01:01:29.218 --> 01:01:32.288
how can I pretend nothing happened?

01:01:57.538 --> 01:01:58.778
Sae Hee!

01:02:10.768 --> 01:02:13.818
[17th Presidential Primary Election,
New People's Party National Convention]

01:02:16.518 --> 01:02:17.867
It should be safe tomorrow.

01:02:17.868 --> 01:02:19.297
There are no places anyone can hide either.

01:02:19.298 --> 01:02:21.557
As long as we keep a close eye on
the identities of the reporters tomorrow,

01:02:21.558 --> 01:02:23.297
there shouldn't be a problem.

01:02:23.298 --> 01:02:26.937
All right, those whiny reporters,

01:02:26.938 --> 01:02:31.917
won't be able to write nonsense
anymore, right?

01:02:31.918 --> 01:02:33.627
Oh, Agent Kim.

01:02:33.638 --> 01:02:34.338
Yes.

01:02:34.348 --> 01:02:36.487
Can you please go up to Room 26
on the 19th floor.

01:02:36.488 --> 01:02:39.977
Tell them you're my bodyguard,
and bring the documents that I forgot.

01:02:39.978 --> 01:02:42.437
Don't look at them
bring them here directly.

01:02:42.438 --> 01:02:44.537
I'll make a phone call to let them know.

01:02:44.538 --> 01:02:47.398
Yes, I understand.

01:02:51.158 --> 01:02:52.838
1925...

01:02:53.148 --> 01:02:54.278
5...

01:02:54.488 --> 01:02:55.618
6...?

01:02:56.288 --> 01:02:57.507
Ah, you idiot.

01:02:57.508 --> 01:03:00.798
How could you forget that already?!

01:03:12.398 --> 01:03:13.808
<i>Yes?</i>

01:03:58.438 --> 01:03:59.817
<i>What is Prosecutor Kim Young Joo doing here?</i>

01:03:59.818 --> 01:04:00.997
<i>Prosecutor?</i>

01:04:00.998 --> 01:04:01.887
<i>Have you found it?</i>

01:04:01.888 --> 01:04:04.847
<i>It looks like he isn't
an easy prosecutor to go up against.</i>

01:04:04.848 --> 01:04:07.897
<i>Your parents are really lucky
to have such a good son like you.</i>

01:04:07.898 --> 01:04:09.157
<i>I don't have a mother.</i>

01:04:09.158 --> 01:04:11.377
<i>You have to pay special attention
to how you act.</i>

01:04:11.378 --> 01:04:13.497
<i>Are you saying
you want to bring me down?</i>

01:04:13.498 --> 01:04:14.417
<i>Candidate Seo!</i>

01:04:14.418 --> 01:04:15.667
<i>Go ahead and try!</i>

01:04:15.668 --> 01:04:16.637
<i>Is it really because of a girl?</i>

01:04:16.638 --> 01:04:17.697
<i>It isn't because of a girl.</i>

01:04:17.698 --> 01:04:19.277
<i>Why are you still hesitating?</i>

01:04:19.278 --> 01:04:20.367
<i>The time isn't right yet.</i>

01:04:20.368 --> 01:04:24.167
You've become really arrogant
after not seeing you in such a long time.
