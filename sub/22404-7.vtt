- Is that true?
You guys witches?

10:49.523 --> 10:50.900
- No.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.902
- Well this guy
says you're witches.

10:55.529 --> 10:58.115
- Hey, look, we will
explain the whole thing..

10:58.199 --> 11:02.411
Right behind
those berry bushes.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.747
- Okay. Let's go talk
behind the bushes.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.832
- Alright let's go.
- Oh okay, let's go.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.292
You know you guys got
nothin' to worry about.

11:08.376 --> 11:09.710
- I don't even
know any witches.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.295
- He's a little loco
if you ask me.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.673
- Have you ever had
a severe head injury?

- C'mon, we better
get outta here.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.108

11:32.191 --> 11:33.943
- We'll get Drex later!
Let's go!

11:34.026 --> 11:35.319
- Go!
Go where dude?!?

11:35.403 --> 11:36.904
It's 1989, we have no
idea where we..?!?

11:36.987 --> 11:37.655
- I know exactly
where we can go!

11:37.738 --> 11:41.033
We can go to--
- Oh my god!!!

11:41.117 --> 11:43.536
- What?!?
What?

11:45.371 --> 11:46.831
- Hey!

11:46.914 --> 11:49.208

12:13.190 --> 12:16.318
- Daaang girl,
why you stressin'?

12:16.402 --> 12:18.112
- I'm stressing because
if he can't fix it,

12:18.195 --> 12:20.406
we may never see
Ray or Henry ever again!

12:20.489 --> 12:21.866
- If that happens,

12:21.949 --> 12:23.826
can I sleep
in Captain Man's bed?

12:27.788 --> 12:29.206
[electric buzzing]

12:29.290 --> 12:30.791
- Okay...

12:30.875 --> 12:32.835
- Can you fix the Time Portal?!?

12:32.918 --> 12:35.546
- Yes and no.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.631
- Well...?
- Which is it?

12:37.715 --> 12:40.176
- No.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.094
I mean, I could if we had

12:42.178 --> 12:43.762
a little bit of zeridium.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.347
- Nuh-uh, no way.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.183
I promised my mom I wouldn't
try any of that stuff

12:47.266 --> 12:49.518
'til I get to college.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.353
- Nooo, see...

12:51.437 --> 12:53.689
zeridium is a powerful
radio-active substance.

12:53.772 --> 12:57.443
And it's against the law
to have here, in America.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.987
- I'm gonna look up zeridium.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.740
- Yeah, I don't care.

13:02.823 --> 13:04.241
- Why do you need stuff
that's illegal

13:04.325 --> 13:06.577
and radio-active
to fix the time portal?

13:06.660 --> 13:08.454
- Because, for time travel,

13:08.537 --> 13:09.955
you need lots
and lots of energy--

13:10.039 --> 13:12.500
and zeridium
is extremely powerful.

13:12.583 --> 13:13.876
- Then go get some.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.711
- Ulch, how you expect me
to get zeridium?!?

13:15.794 --> 13:20.007
You want I should go
to Radio Active Shack

13:20.090 --> 13:22.718
and ask the stupid person
at customer service,

13:22.801 --> 13:25.554
"Yo man, where's
the zeridium at?"

13:25.638 --> 13:27.890
- Hey,

- Henry's sister?
- Yeah!

13:46.116 --> 13:47.952
The government tried to
take it away from her,

13:48.035 --> 13:50.246
so she buried it
in her backyard.

- Do you think you could
find the doll again,

13:51.914 --> 13:52.957
in Henry's backyard?

13:53.040 --> 13:54.208
- Sure.

let us take it.

into the time portal,

We gotta know why
Drex came here to 1989!

19:31.044 --> 19:33.255
- Maybe he just picked
a random time and place.

19:33.338 --> 19:34.548
- Nah.
I know Drex.

19:34.631 --> 19:38.760
He picked 1989
for some reason.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.839
he said it was
"Take Your Kid To Work" Day.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.549
- Yeah, so?

21:01.259 --> 21:02.219
OH MY GOD.

21:03.512 --> 21:06.014
- My Dad takes me
to work today.

21:06.098 --> 21:10.686
Young me,
eight year old me.

21:10.769 --> 21:11.979
My Dad takes me
to Glass Tech

21:12.062 --> 21:16.858
for Take Your Kid
To Work Day.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.027
Henry, this is the day
that I become indestructible,

21:19.111 --> 21:20.237
don't you see?

21:20.320 --> 21:21.822
- Yes! Sorta! No!

21:21.905 --> 21:25.242
- That's why Drex came here!

21:25.325 --> 21:26.368
He's gonna try to stop me

21:26.451 --> 21:27.452
from going to work with my dad,

21:27.536 --> 21:28.745
so I don't get densitized!

21:28.829 --> 21:30.038
- So you don't become
indestructible!

21:30.122 --> 21:33.250
- Which means
no Captain Man...

21:33.333 --> 21:35.043
- No Kid Danger...

21:35.127 --> 21:35.961
- We gotta stop Drex!!!

21:36.044 --> 21:39.214
- Let's go,
lets go!!!

21:42.342 --> 21:44.469
- We don't have a car.
- Or a bike.

21:44.553 --> 21:45.762
- Can you give us a ride?

21:45.846 --> 21:46.722
{\an8}- We're are still
pretty hungry.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.557
{\an8}- If we could borrow
like twenty bucks...

21:48.640 --> 21:50.183
{\an8}- Where is the beef?

21:55.063 --> 21:57.607
