00:03.458 --> 00:04.375
Okay, people.

00:04.375 --> 00:07.834
PJ's birthday is this Saturday,
and everyone needs to buy him a present.

00:08.458 --> 00:10.375
And by everyone, I mean Gabe.

00:12.834 --> 00:14.250
And by buy him a present,

00:14.375 --> 00:15.875
she means actually purchase one.

00:17.208 --> 00:18.959
Not borrow or steal it.

00:21.291 --> 00:24.375
Why are you guys picking on me?
I always get PJ a present.

00:24.834 --> 00:27.709
Last year you wrapped up one of his shirts
and gave it to him.

00:29.959 --> 00:31.291
And he loved it.

00:33.291 --> 00:36.208
I can't believe my baby boy
is turning 18.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.208
Hey, guys.

00:42.750 --> 00:44.041
What you talking about?

00:44.125 --> 00:45.250
All: Nothing.

00:45.917 --> 00:47.250
What you whistling about?

00:48.792 --> 00:50.917
Not my birthday, that's for sure.

00:53.250 --> 00:54.750
- Hey, PJ,
- Hmm?

00:55.166 --> 00:57.875
How would you like a pair of pants
exactly like those?

01:01.375 --> 01:02.625
Oh, man.

01:03.375 --> 01:04.250
Teddy, you okay?

01:04.333 --> 01:06.542
I'm just bummed out
I have to kiss Spencer.

01:06.875 --> 01:08.417
Your ex-boyfriend Spencer?

01:09.125 --> 01:10.291
The one who cheated on you?

01:10.750 --> 01:12.959
No, dad, the other Spencer in my life.

01:14.959 --> 01:15.917
Well, why...

01:16.375 --> 01:17.834
Why would you wanna kiss that guy?

01:17.917 --> 01:19.375
'Cause I need a car.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.083
Tell him more. He's lost.

01:25.458 --> 01:28.083
Okay, so I got a new job
at Super Adventure Land.

01:28.375 --> 01:31.000
I play the Princess.
The Princess has to kiss the frog.

01:31.083 --> 01:32.417
And the frog is...

01:34.333 --> 01:35.250
Spencer.

01:37.834 --> 01:39.667
Teddy, honey, I feel for you.

01:39.750 --> 01:42.250
I know how uncomfortable
it is to kiss your ex.

01:42.542 --> 01:44.417

Charlie,

02:58.458 --> 02:59.917
did you do something with Daddy's can?

03:00.250 --> 03:01.250
No, Daddy.

03:02.417 --> 03:03.834
Well, did you see where it went?

03:04.375 --> 03:05.667
It's a secret.

03:07.583 --> 03:09.667
Well, do you wanna tell Daddy the secret?

03:10.792 --> 03:12.000
Gabe.

03:13.125 --> 03:15.041
That's why you're my favorite.

03:21.667 --> 03:22.667
Gabe,

03:23.125 --> 03:24.291
did you just steal my can?

03:25.083 --> 03:25.917
Can?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.750
I, I don't know anything about a can.

03:29.542 --> 03:30.750
Step away from the cupboard.

03:30.917 --> 03:31.792
No.

03:31.875 --> 03:32.917
No, Dad.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.125
- Come on. Step away.
- Dad, I really don't think you want to...

03:40.792 --> 03:41.917
...do that.

03:43.667 --> 03:44.834
What's going on?

03:45.959 --> 03:47.166
I'm recycling.

03:48.875 --> 03:49.959
No kidding.

03:50.041 --> 03:50.959
Yeah!

03:51.041 --> 03:52.000
I'm...

03:52.083 --> 03:53.500
I'm concerned about the environment.

03:53.583 --> 03:56.208
I'm gonna be on this planet
for a really long time.

03:56.959 --> 03:57.917
Now, you?

03:58.291 --> 04:00.125
You, you've got nothing to worry about.

04:01.250 --> 04:04.041
So, all this sudden interest in recycling

04:04.125 --> 04:06.291
has nothing to do
with the fact that maybe...

04:06.875 --> 04:08.667
you think you can make
a little money off it?

04:09.417 --> 04:10.875
Oh, is that right?

04:11.291 --> 04:12.875
I did not know that.

04:13.250 --> 04:14.125
Huh.

04:14.208 --> 04:16.166
Well, here's something else
you don't seem to know.

04:16.250 --> 04:18.083
In the state of Colorado,

04:18.166 --> 04:20.208
they don't give you money
for aluminum cans.

04:21.875 --> 04:22.709
Oh...

04:23.208 --> 04:24.375
Yeah, I knew that.

04:25.917 --> 04:28.208
Oh, dad, by the way,
can you give me a ride?

04:28.250 --> 04:29.333
Sure, where to?

04:29.750 --> 04:30.750
Kansas.

04:37.291 --> 04:38.291
Hey, mom, guess what?

04:38.375 --> 04:39.625
I joined Spanish club.

04:41.208 --> 04:43.875
Is this about taking a school trip
or meeting girls?

04:45.417 --> 04:47.125
It's about taking a trip...

04:47.625 --> 04:48.542
with girls.

04:49.709 --> 04:50.875
Or as we say in Spanish,

04:51.166 --> 04:52.583
con girls.

04:53.250 --> 04:54.125
Yeah.

04:54.208 --> 04:56.208
Anyway, I'm gonna need
a passport to go to Mexico,

04:56.291 --> 04:57.583
so I'll need my birth certificate.

04:59.625 --> 05:00.750
You need your birth certificate?

05:00.834 --> 05:01.959
Yeah, you got it, right?

05:02.709 --> 05:03.583
Yeah.

05:06.041 --> 05:07.000
It's, um...

05:08.041 --> 05:09.250
it's in my files.

05:10.709 --> 05:12.125
I will dig it out for you.

05:12.250 --> 05:13.792
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

05:18.917 --> 05:19.917
Bob,

05:20.583 --> 05:21.667
it finally happened.

05:21.750 --> 05:23.125
PJ Wants to see his birth certificate.

05:23.291 --> 05:25.417
We knew this day would come.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.709
Oh, stop whimpering and man up.

05:37.917 --> 05:38.667
Hey.

05:38.750 --> 05:39.709
Hey.

05:40.083 --> 05:41.458
So, today is the...

05:42.000 --> 05:43.959
day of the big kiss, huh?

05:44.041 --> 05:45.250
Yeah, I guess so.

05:49.542 --> 05:50.667
You look great...

05:50.792 --> 05:51.750
uh, in that outfit.

05:51.834 --> 05:52.750
Oh, I know. I mean,

05:53.417 --> 05:54.250
thanks.

05:56.625 --> 05:58.959
Look, Spencer. There's no reason
why this has to be awkward.

06:00.375 --> 06:03.834
It's not you and I kissing.
It's just our characters. I mean...

06:04.458 --> 06:05.625
we're professionals, right?

06:06.583 --> 06:07.917
Yeah, right, right.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.792
I'm as professional as a guy in a...

06:11.000 --> 06:13.041
frog suit, making minimum wage, can be.

06:18.250 --> 06:19.333
Well,

06:19.375 --> 06:20.417
that's our cue.

06:20.959 --> 06:22.000
See you out there.

06:31.583 --> 06:34.250
Announcer: And when their joyous dance
came to an end,

06:34.750 --> 06:38.333
the prince and the princess
sealed their love with a kiss.

06:46.333 --> 06:47.542
Wait, Teddy.

06:48.083 --> 06:50.583
Narrator: And the prince and the princess
walked off together

06:50.667 --> 06:53.125
and lived happily ever after.

07:01.166 --> 07:05.500
Bob, you had 18 years to change PJ's
birth certificate. Why didn't you?

07:05.875 --> 07:08.041
For once, can we not play the blame game?

07:08.125 --> 07:09.250
It's the only game we know.

07:11.875 --> 07:14.250
Okay, look, there is
a very simple solution.

07:14.417 --> 07:16.625
We'll just tell PJ that we can't afford
to send him to Mexico.

07:17.041 --> 07:18.417
You want me to lie to him?

07:21.083 --> 07:22.083
I'm in.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.000
Hola, padre. Hola, madre.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.500
Hola, Senor and Senora Duncan.

07:34.917 --> 07:36.834
Hola, Emmett. Como estas?

07:36.917 --> 07:37.917
What did she say?

07:40.000 --> 07:41.500
- I have no idea.
- Hmm.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.917
Uh, PJ, hey, listen.

07:44.959 --> 07:47.041
Look, we've got some
bad news about the trip,

07:47.125 --> 07:49.417
which is heartbreaking
considering how well you're doing...

07:49.500 --> 07:51.250
with the Spanish.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.542
Honey,

07:55.625 --> 07:58.250
we can't afford to pay for your trip
to Mexico. I'm so sorry.

07:58.625 --> 08:00.917
Actually, the Spanish club's been
having fundraisers all year.

08:01.041 --> 08:02.291
- The trip is paid for.
- Yeah.

08:02.375 --> 08:05.417
Won't cost you a dime. It's a free trip
to our neighbors to the north.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.083
It's south.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.875
Hmm, not on the way back.

08:27.667 --> 08:28.875
Spencer?

08:28.959 --> 08:30.458
Hey, uh, can we talk?

08:35.667 --> 08:36.583
I, uh,

08:36.667 --> 08:38.041
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

08:38.125 --> 08:39.542
No, I'm not okay.

08:40.542 --> 08:42.333
Teddy, I feel terrible
about this, all right?

08:42.417 --> 08:44.959
I mean, you had the job first,
and if kissing me makes you feel that bad,

08:45.041 --> 08:46.208
then I'm just going to quit.

08:46.709 --> 08:48.667
No, Spencer, it's not
that the kiss was bad.

08:48.750 --> 08:50.458
It's that the kiss was...

08:52.166 --> 08:53.125
good.

08:53.667 --> 08:54.792
Oh.

08:58.458 --> 09:00.375
You know, I didn't want it to be good.

09:00.458 --> 09:03.458
In fact, I was all prepared
to be disgusted.

09:05.458 --> 09:06.417
Thanks.

09:08.458 --> 09:10.208
Now, I don't know what to do.

09:11.375 --> 09:12.417
Teddy.

09:15.625 --> 09:18.000
Hurting you was the stupidest thing
I ever did.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.417
Will you please give me
another chance?

09:35.625 --> 09:38.417
Did you notice that every time we kiss,
balloons appear?

09:40.083 --> 09:41.333
Oh, good, you're seeing them too.

09:47.375 --> 09:48.375
Come on, Charlie, say it.

09:48.375 --> 09:49.625
I love you.

09:51.041 --> 09:52.917
Isn't that adorable, Grandma?

09:53.166 --> 09:56.041
Yeah, she made me call
just so she could tell you that.

09:56.583 --> 10:00.125
Hey, listen, grandma, while I got you
on the horn, a thought occurred to me.

10:01.125 --> 10:03.917
Every year you send me
a Christmas check for $50.

10:04.417 --> 10:06.208
And, you know what?
I was thinking about it.

10:06.458 --> 10:09.667
Wouldn't it be easier if you just sent me
the next ten checks all at once?

10:09.750 --> 10:11.542
You know, kind of a like a pre-pay plan.

10:11.667 --> 10:12.542
Gabe.

10:12.625 --> 10:13.959
Gotta go.

10:15.542 --> 10:17.291
Okay, out with it.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.333
What are you trying to get this money for?

10:22.250 --> 10:23.166
All right.

10:23.917 --> 10:25.250
The truth is,

10:26.333 --> 10:28.041
I want the Z-Cube Six.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.875
A new game system?

10:29.959 --> 10:32.250
I just got you the Z-Cube Five last year.

10:33.041 --> 10:34.125
Yeah, last year.

10:34.208 --> 10:36.000
It doesn't even have 3D graphics.

10:36.083 --> 10:38.166
I might as well just use it
as a footstool.

10:41.542 --> 10:42.417
Okay.

10:42.500 --> 10:45.125
You are gonna have to find
another way to make money

10:45.208 --> 10:48.000
without shaking down your relatives.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.875
Hello?

10:53.083 --> 10:55.417
Oh, hey, Aunt Diane.

10:56.750 --> 10:58.542
Yeah, thanks for calling back.

10:59.667 --> 11:01.000
Oh, what did I want?

11:01.834 --> 11:03.166
Uh... just...

11:03.709 --> 11:05.250
to say I, uh...

11:06.250 --> 11:07.417
I love ya.

11:08.041 --> 11:09.542
See what you're making me do?

11:16.458 --> 11:17.542
Uh, PJ...

11:18.041 --> 11:19.417
There's something I need to tell you.

11:19.792 --> 11:21.125
Now, before I say anything,

11:21.750 --> 11:22.792
I just want you to know,

11:22.875 --> 11:25.125
your mother and I, we love you very much.

11:27.583 --> 11:29.250
That doesn't sound good. What's going on?

11:30.083 --> 11:31.792
PJ, we've been keeping a secret from you.

11:32.041 --> 11:33.542
- What is it?
- It's about your name.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.542
Uh... Okay.

11:36.041 --> 11:37.583
As you know,

11:37.834 --> 11:40.166
you were named after
your great-grandfather, Patrick John.

11:40.250 --> 11:42.250
Yeah. Everybody called him Paddy John.

11:42.333 --> 11:43.458
Yeah, yeah.

11:43.542 --> 11:45.166
Yeah, okay, here's what you don't know.

11:45.291 --> 11:46.500
Um...

11:47.291 --> 11:48.458
When you were born...

11:50.542 --> 11:51.667
I filled out the papers.

11:52.125 --> 11:54.667
and, um, I was really nervous

11:54.750 --> 11:56.041
and, um... I...

11:56.125 --> 11:57.583
I, I think my hand was shaking a little,

11:58.125 --> 11:59.250
and... here.

12:04.250 --> 12:05.500
That is your...

12:06.041 --> 12:07.792
legal birth certificate.

12:14.417 --> 12:17.500
- That's what PJ Stands for?
- I'm afraid so.

12:17.583 --> 12:18.667
My name is

12:18.792 --> 12:20.333
"Potty John"?

12:23.500 --> 12:25.208
Legally, yes.

12:26.792 --> 12:28.125
Potty John.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.709
I'm named after two toilets.

12:34.041 --> 12:34.959
Legally,

12:35.041 --> 12:35.917
yeah.

12:36.750 --> 12:38.375
And you never bothered to fix this?

12:38.458 --> 12:39.750
Well, we always meant to.

12:39.834 --> 12:41.542
I just... We just never got around to it.

12:41.625 --> 12:43.834
I mean, kind of like
the upstairs potty, huh?

12:47.709 --> 12:48.792
Too soon?

12:57.709 --> 12:59.625
So, your dad and I were talking, and...

13:00.125 --> 13:02.959
we feel really bad that you have to
go to work every day

13:03.041 --> 13:05.000
and kiss that horrible Spencer.

13:06.375 --> 13:07.417
Yeah.

13:07.500 --> 13:08.458
Horrible's kind of a...

13:09.375 --> 13:10.542
strong word.

13:12.750 --> 13:13.750
Anyway,

13:13.834 --> 13:17.417
since the only reason you're doing this
is to get money for a car,

13:18.250 --> 13:19.250
well...

13:20.625 --> 13:21.625
come with me.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.333
Ta-da!

13:29.417 --> 13:30.875
Oh, what's this?

13:31.208 --> 13:32.875
It's your new car.

13:32.959 --> 13:33.834
Shut up!

13:34.834 --> 13:37.542
One of the other nurses was selling it,
I got a great price,

13:38.000 --> 13:39.208
now it's all yours.

13:39.291 --> 13:41.250
Oh, I don't know what to say.

13:41.792 --> 13:43.959
Teddy: Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

13:44.041 --> 13:45.250
Get in.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.208
And the best part is
now you can quit your job

13:48.291 --> 13:50.709
so that you never have to go near
that jerk Spencer ever again.

13:52.166 --> 13:53.417
Yay.

13:55.083 --> 13:56.291
You should give it a name.

13:57.709 --> 13:58.583
I know.

13:58.667 --> 14:03.000
How about "The-Now-I-Don't-Have-To-
Kiss-Spencer-Anymore-Mobile"?

14:04.166 --> 14:05.250
Or "Ed."

14:06.083 --> 14:07.041
I kinda like Ed.

14:14.667 --> 14:15.875
Come on in, guys.

14:15.959 --> 14:17.500
Right this way.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.208
The fun begins in a minute.

14:20.875 --> 14:22.333
- Uh, Gabe.
- Yeah?

14:22.959 --> 14:24.667
Who are these kids?
I've never seen them before.

14:25.500 --> 14:28.917
You've never seen them because these are
the kids that never get invited anywhere.

14:31.125 --> 14:34.166
Okay, so why are they here?
What's in it for you?

14:36.000 --> 14:39.208
The satisfaction of bringing joy
to a few sad misfits.

14:40.709 --> 14:41.583
Excuse me.

14:41.667 --> 14:42.542
Yeah.

14:42.625 --> 14:45.417
Do I give you the $20 now
or when the play date's over?

14:47.041 --> 14:48.709
- Now's good.
- Awesome.

14:51.750 --> 14:52.625
Gabe.

14:53.667 --> 14:56.083
Did you see the smile
on the little scamp's face?

15:03.667 --> 15:06.667
Mom, I had the craziest dream last night.

15:06.750 --> 15:07.917
- Teddy: See--
- Ooh, me too.

15:08.834 --> 15:10.792
I was in high school, only I had wings.

15:10.875 --> 15:12.500
And all the cheerleaders
were really jealous

15:12.583 --> 15:14.875
because I kept flying
around during our routine.

15:14.959 --> 15:17.625
Then out of nowhere, Lady Gaga appears,
throws a shoe at me--

15:17.709 --> 15:20.458
Okay, Mom, can we stay on me?

15:21.625 --> 15:22.458
Anyway,

15:22.542 --> 15:24.250
in my crazy dream,

15:24.333 --> 15:27.333
Spencer and I got back together,

15:27.417 --> 15:31.417
and then you guys found out,
and you took my car away.

15:32.041 --> 15:33.125
Well, duh.

15:34.375 --> 15:36.667
You know, Teddy, my dreams are a lot more
entertaining than yours.

15:40.750 --> 15:42.750
Mom, I have to tell you something. I'm--

15:42.834 --> 15:44.917
Did you know that this car
has satellite radio?

15:45.417 --> 15:46.875
- It does?
- Mm-hmm.

15:46.959 --> 15:48.458
Over a hundred stations.

15:48.542 --> 15:49.625
Huh.

15:49.709 --> 15:50.667
You were saying?

15:51.417 --> 15:52.875
Right. Right, okay.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.166
Um, here's the thing...

15:54.250 --> 15:55.250
I'm--

15:55.709 --> 15:57.333
is that an mp3 hookup?

15:58.834 --> 16:00.625
This baby's fully-loaded.

16:01.375 --> 16:04.125
Oh, man, you are not making this easier.

16:05.667 --> 16:07.333
Speaking of making things easier,

16:07.417 --> 16:10.125
Ba-bam! Your very own gas card.

16:11.250 --> 16:12.250
Oh.

16:13.583 --> 16:15.417
And so you don't get lost..

16:15.500 --> 16:16.792
Ba-bam!

16:16.875 --> 16:18.500
Your very own GPS.

16:21.750 --> 16:23.250
Now, what was it you wanted to tell me?

16:24.875 --> 16:28.083
Mom, I wanted to tell you
that I'm in love...

16:30.417 --> 16:31.291
With Ed.

16:38.417 --> 16:41.083
All right, this is from Gabe.

16:43.834 --> 16:46.208
A $10 gift card for frozen yogurt.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.500
There's probably about $6 left on it.

16:51.041 --> 16:52.250
I was feeling snacky.

16:54.250 --> 16:55.542
Okay, here's mine.

16:55.875 --> 16:57.125
Okay.

17:00.834 --> 17:02.709
It's a journal for your trip to Mexico.

17:02.792 --> 17:05.166
Every day you can write
what you did, what you saw,

17:05.250 --> 17:07.041
- how you felt about it.
- Oh!

17:07.125 --> 17:08.375
- I love it.
- Yeah.

17:09.083 --> 17:11.083
You didn't happen to get
a gift receipt for this, did you?

17:13.166 --> 17:14.333
No.

17:14.417 --> 17:16.875
Okay, here's a little something
from Mom and Dad.

17:16.959 --> 17:18.041
All right.

17:20.667 --> 17:21.583
Oh.

17:21.959 --> 17:24.000
Wow. Guys, this is so generous.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.625
It's just a little spending
money for Mexico.

17:26.667 --> 17:27.792
Enjoy your dinero.

17:28.375 --> 17:29.792
Do I have to spend it on dinero?

17:29.875 --> 17:32.375
Can I use it for breakfast-o or lunch-o?

17:34.250 --> 17:37.000
Sweetie, when you're down there,
stay close to the teacher.

17:38.583 --> 17:39.834
Uh, there is...

17:40.375 --> 17:42.083
one more thing we got you.

17:42.375 --> 17:43.834
Went down to the courthouse this morning.

17:43.917 --> 17:45.917
Finally got your birth certificate fixed.

17:46.000 --> 17:46.875
Oh.

17:46.959 --> 17:49.625
You are now officially PJ Duncan.

17:52.166 --> 17:53.917
Dad, did you double-check this?

17:54.000 --> 17:54.875
No.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.917
Why? How could anybody
possibly mess up PJ?

17:58.208 --> 17:59.083
Don't ask me.

17:59.583 --> 18:01.291
According to this, my name's PP Duncan.

18:06.250 --> 18:08.500
Journal's not looking so bad now, is it?

18:09.166 --> 18:09.875
Well,

18:10.125 --> 18:11.875
looks like that's all the presents, PP.

18:11.959 --> 18:13.166
Happy birthday.

18:13.250 --> 18:14.709
Oh, wait, there's one left.

18:14.792 --> 18:16.208
This says it's from Charlie.

18:16.250 --> 18:17.542
- Charlie?
- Mm-hm.

18:17.625 --> 18:19.250
You didn't have to get me anything.

18:20.625 --> 18:22.792
What? A new guitar.

18:23.208 --> 18:24.417
That's just what I wanted.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.667
How'd you guys know?

18:29.250 --> 18:31.250
Oh, this is so cool.

18:35.583 --> 18:36.625
Hey, Gabe.

18:38.166 --> 18:39.583
How you liking that new Z-Cube?

18:40.250 --> 18:42.250
Oh, I decided not to get it.

18:42.333 --> 18:44.000
The Z-Cube seven's coming out soon.

18:44.917 --> 18:48.000
You used that money to buy
that new guitar for your brother.

18:49.458 --> 18:50.834
I, I don't know what you're talking about.

18:50.917 --> 18:52.125
Oh, come on, Gabe.

18:52.917 --> 18:54.000
All right.

18:54.083 --> 18:57.542
If you tell anybody about this,
I will never forgive you.

18:57.875 --> 18:59.500
Well, why would you wanna
keep this a secret?

19:00.834 --> 19:02.166
Because...

19:02.959 --> 19:05.875
I can't have people thinking
that I've gone soft or that...

19:06.750 --> 19:08.083
I love my brother.

19:09.542 --> 19:11.792
All right, all right.
Your secret is safe with me.

19:12.542 --> 19:13.458
I'm proud of you.

19:14.542 --> 19:15.792
You're a good kid.

19:16.667 --> 19:19.375
See, that's the exact kind of talk
I was afraid of.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.291
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

19:29.375 --> 19:30.709
Amy: Hi, honey.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.500
There are the keys to Ed.
I'm giving him back.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.709
What? Why?

19:36.792 --> 19:39.375
Because you're gonna take him back anyway.

19:39.709 --> 19:40.959
Why would we do that?

19:41.375 --> 19:43.959
There's a secret I've been
keeping from you guys.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Come on in.

19:49.792 --> 19:51.208
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Duncan.

19:53.166 --> 19:54.500
Spencer and I are dating again.

19:57.250 --> 19:58.875
At first, I didn't wanna tell you guys

19:58.959 --> 20:01.291
because I was afraid that you would
take away the car. I...

20:01.500 --> 20:02.917
I figured that I had a choice to make,

20:03.000 --> 20:04.583
either Ed or Spencer.

20:04.667 --> 20:06.458
So, after thinking about it
for a long time--

20:06.542 --> 20:07.417
A really...

20:07.917 --> 20:08.959
long time.

20:11.792 --> 20:13.083
I chose Spencer.

20:13.250 --> 20:14.709
I decided to give him another chance.

20:14.792 --> 20:16.834
So we're back together now and...

20:17.709 --> 20:18.792
I'm very happy.

20:20.250 --> 20:21.875
Well...

20:22.917 --> 20:24.625
I'm just glad you could be honest with us.

20:25.834 --> 20:27.917
And if you're happy,

20:28.750 --> 20:30.125
I guess that's all that really matters.

20:30.583 --> 20:31.709
Thanks.

20:36.417 --> 20:37.500
What?

20:37.792 --> 20:39.125
You're letting me keep the car?

20:39.458 --> 20:41.166
We're letting you pay for the car.

20:43.458 --> 20:45.542
With the job that you are going to keep.

20:46.709 --> 20:47.917
Fair enough.

20:50.333 --> 20:51.834
Welcome back to the family, Spencer.

20:53.625 --> 20:55.083
And if you ever

20:57.041 --> 20:58.458
hurt my little girl again...

21:00.250 --> 21:01.375
Ba-bam!

21:11.333 --> 21:12.542
Hey, Charlie. So...

21:13.000 --> 21:13.917
big news.

21:14.208 --> 21:17.583
This week, I got a new old boyfriend
named Spencer,

21:17.667 --> 21:19.959
and an old new car named Ed.

21:20.542 --> 21:23.083
Someday, if I take good care of him,
you can have him.

21:23.834 --> 21:24.959
Oh, Ed.

21:25.041 --> 21:26.083
Not Spencer.

21:26.458 --> 21:27.417
That'd just be weird.

21:27.500 --> 21:28.625
Excuse me.

21:28.709 --> 21:29.583
What...

21:29.667 --> 21:30.750
Who are you?

21:30.834 --> 21:31.917
I'm Elliot.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.875
I paid Gabe for another play date.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.291
We're playing hide and seek,

21:35.375 --> 21:37.333
and I've been hiding
for almost five hours.

21:38.750 --> 21:40.208
Gabe went to baseball practice.

21:40.834 --> 21:41.709
Oh,

21:41.792 --> 21:42.792
I'll wait.

21:44.041 --> 21:45.166
Well...

21:46.458 --> 21:48.083
I guess there's
only one thing left to say.

21:48.834 --> 21:50.250
Oh, hey!

21:50.375 --> 21:51.875
You're here. Why don't you say it?

21:52.125 --> 21:53.417
Good luck, Charlie.

22:02.875 --> 22:03.917
Ed: Teddy.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.500
Who said that?

22:07.583 --> 22:08.500
Ed: It's me,

22:09.000 --> 22:10.083
your car.

22:10.959 --> 22:11.834
Ed?

22:12.208 --> 22:13.291
You can talk?

22:13.417 --> 22:15.000
Ed: I prefer Edward

22:15.834 --> 22:17.000
and yes.

22:17.083 --> 22:18.125
Oh!

22:18.208 --> 22:19.667
So, I have a talking car?

22:19.750 --> 22:23.667
Ooh! Does that mean we're gonna go
on adventures and solve crimes and stuff?

22:24.667 --> 22:25.709
Ed: Well,

22:25.792 --> 22:27.542
that sounds kind of dangerous.

22:27.625 --> 22:31.083
I thought we'd just drive carefully
and stay within the speed limit...

22:31.500 --> 22:32.583
and stuff.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.166
Oh, man.

22:35.166 --> 22:36.917
So, I have a talking car who's boring?

22:37.625 --> 22:40.458
Ed: Oh, uh, one other thing
I have to tell you...

22:40.959 --> 22:42.500
I don't feel so good.

22:46.500 --> 22:47.792
Ed, Edward.

22:48.792 --> 22:50.291
Edward, talk to me!

22:51.417 --> 22:52.750
Ed: Gotcha!

22:52.834 --> 22:53.792
Oh.

22:54.166 --> 22:56.166
Ed: Not so boring now, am I?
