WEBVTT

00:00.901 --> 00:02.803
My name is Kara Zor-El.

00:02.836 --> 00:04.338
I'm from Krypton.

00:04.372 --> 00:06.507
I'm a refugee on this planet.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.177
I was sent to earth
to protect my cousin.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.212
But my pod got knocked
off course.

00:11.245 --> 00:12.646
And by the time I got here,

00:12.680 --> 00:17.385
my cousin had already grown up
and become... Superman.

00:17.418 --> 00:20.054
I hid who I really was
until one day

00:20.088 --> 00:23.457
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:23.491 --> 00:26.827
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.597
But in secret I work
with my adopted sister

00:29.630 --> 00:32.566
for the DEO to protect my city
from alien life

00:32.600 --> 00:35.369
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.606
I am Supergirl.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.543
Previously
on Supergirl...

00:42.576 --> 00:45.146
You need help,
you're not thinking clearly.

00:45.179 --> 00:46.814
I'm thinking like a Luthor.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.682
Alex, I think
something's wrong with me.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.084
I keep losing time.

00:50.118 --> 00:53.587
-Sam, just take a deep breath.
-No. I don't know
where I've been.

00:53.621 --> 00:58.292
When the others awake and unite
beneath the standard of Reign.

00:58.326 --> 00:59.593
What do you mean, "others"?

00:59.627 --> 01:01.195
Worldkillers.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.631
She called them
"purity and pestilence."

01:03.664 --> 01:06.667
Now all we have to do
is find them before Reign does.

01:27.155 --> 01:29.323
Worldkillers are still
out there.

01:29.357 --> 01:31.525
The city has been quiet
ever since you got back
from Fort Rozz.

01:31.559 --> 01:34.262
Yeah, I mean, we've been trying
to track Kryptonian
heat signatures,

01:34.295 --> 01:36.264
but all we're coming up with
is you and your cousin.

01:36.297 --> 01:40.868
Which, I will say though,
is nice, because I know
where he is.

01:40.901 --> 01:45.406
Well, shouldn't they be reading
like they're me, basically?

01:45.439 --> 01:46.840
Yeah,
but they're not like you.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.678
They may have been
created on Krypton,

01:50.711 --> 01:53.381
but these Worldkillers are not,
strictly speaking, Kryptonian.

01:53.414 --> 01:54.748
Mon-El's right.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.351
Nothing about them
follows a pattern we recognize.

01:57.385 --> 02:00.621
Reign didn't need a yellow sun
or a Fort Rozz
to retain her powers.

02:00.654 --> 02:03.657
Yeah, and the way she
just shrugged off
that Kryptonite...

02:03.691 --> 02:06.760
Hey, but maybe they were
genetically modified.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.629
Now, that's possible.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.265
The Legion's fought
many hybrids
that were created in labs

02:11.299 --> 02:13.634
designed to have
maximum destruction.

02:13.667 --> 02:17.371
Well, Reign said
she left Krypton
right before it exploded.

02:17.405 --> 02:20.574
If they've been here
all this time, what have they
been waiting for?

02:21.775 --> 02:23.877
Maybe for her.

02:25.413 --> 02:26.880
You know,
when Krypton exploded,

02:26.914 --> 02:29.450
pods weren't the only thing
that rained down on Earth,

02:29.483 --> 02:30.918
so did Kryptonite.

02:30.951 --> 02:32.520
Yeah, Brainy had to track
some of that green stuff down

02:32.553 --> 02:33.887
when the Legion battled Zod.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.789
Um, rewind. Zod?

02:35.823 --> 02:37.758
Superman killed him, so...

02:37.791 --> 02:38.959
Was he resurrected?

02:38.992 --> 02:42.896
He was. But that's the future.
We talked about that.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.965
So, you're saying,
basically, that the Kryptonite

02:44.998 --> 02:46.900
and the pods came
at the same time.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.203
Agent Schott, see if you can
pull our records
of those meteor showers

02:49.237 --> 02:50.804
and map their spray pattern.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.440
There might be a way
we can locate exactly

02:52.473 --> 02:54.275
when these Worldkillers
first arrived.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.543
On it.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.580
Reign will be back.

02:59.613 --> 03:00.948
Soon.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.683
What do you think she's doing?

03:02.716 --> 03:05.586
Well, wherever she is,
she's planning her next move.

03:05.619 --> 03:08.856
So, you were a doctor
before you joined the FBI?

03:08.889 --> 03:09.990
Yeah.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.660
I was gonna be a researcher,

03:12.693 --> 03:16.297
so I had a job actually
up in Seattle for a while.

03:16.330 --> 03:19.300
And then, as it turns out,

03:19.333 --> 03:20.634
I needed a little more action

03:20.668 --> 03:23.704
than just a microscope
and an Excel spreadsheet.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.606
Well, thank you very much
for doing this.

03:25.639 --> 03:28.276
You're sure it's okay
that we use the L

03:28.309 --> 03:30.478
I am. No one will be here
for a while.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.413
Sorry,
I just don't like hospitals.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.748
Hate being sick. Hate tests.

03:34.782 --> 03:38.619
Well, MRI's don't hurt.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.756
Okay.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.659
All right, put your legs.

03:47.027 --> 03:49.897
So, I looked up my symptoms.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.366
Memory loss, headaches,

03:52.400 --> 03:54.001
it could be really bad.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.769
Like, brain tumor bad.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.372
ALS.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.808
You know what else
causes memory loss?

04:00.841 --> 04:03.877
-Caffeine withdrawal. Yikes.
-Right.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.647
Which is why
we're taking pictures.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.848
Okay?

04:07.881 --> 04:09.049
We're gonna find out
what's going on,

04:09.082 --> 04:10.551
and when we do,

04:10.584 --> 04:12.052
we're gonna deal with it.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.621
Whatever it is.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.723
Okay?

04:15.756 --> 04:16.757
All right.

04:18.659 --> 04:19.660
Okay.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.772
Vironique's has the most
overpriced egg Benedict
in the city,

04:31.805 --> 04:33.574
but you will thank me
afterwards.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.509
It sounds great,
but I'm not sure
if I have time.

04:35.543 --> 04:37.511
I have an editorial meeting
at ten o'clock.

04:37.545 --> 04:40.047
Oh, right. Well, you know,
I'll just get Renee
to rush the order

04:40.080 --> 04:41.915
and then I can join you.

04:41.949 --> 04:45.486
I mean, you can,
but I can handle it.

04:46.654 --> 04:47.955
You don't want me to join.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.658
No. Of course,
I always want you by my side,

04:50.691 --> 04:52.793
it's just that, to be honest,

04:52.826 --> 04:55.396
I think the staff
gets a little self-conscious

04:55.429 --> 04:59.400
when the big boss is just kinda
sitting there staring at them.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.902
All right.
Well, maybe I'll join
after the circulation meeting.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.705
Well, well, well.

05:04.738 --> 05:09.042
I thought Vironique's had
a hard "no liberals" policy.

05:09.076 --> 05:12.746
But, apparently,
they're fine with murderers.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.815
You know, Mr. Olsen,
for a newspaper man

05:14.848 --> 05:17.718
I'd like to think you'd be
a little bit more considerate
with your words.

05:17.751 --> 05:21.088
My lawyers can bury you alive
for defamation of character.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.424
I don't know, don't you have
to have a character to defame?

05:23.457 --> 05:24.592
Ooh.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.661
And the pot calls
the kettle black.

05:28.996 --> 05:32.500
You know, Lena, I do love it
when you talk tough though.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.036
You know, Edge,
you act like a bully,

05:36.069 --> 05:39.072
but underneath it all, you are
scared to death
of a powerful woman

05:39.106 --> 05:40.641
you can't control.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.810
You're so terrified,
you would sacrifice kids,

05:42.843 --> 05:44.845
poison our water,
do just about anything

05:44.878 --> 05:48.482
to kill me
and get rid of the problem.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.051
And you got it wrong, Lena.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.120
I like powerful women.

05:53.153 --> 05:55.589
Nay, I love powerful women.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.659
But you're not
a powerful woman.

05:58.692 --> 06:01.028
You're wasting away
in that ivory tower.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.496
Posing as Cat Grant,

06:02.530 --> 06:05.466
hoping that the gleam
of liberal media

06:05.499 --> 06:08.636
is gonna somehow
magically rub off on you.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.504
I don't have to kill you, Lena,

06:12.205 --> 06:13.974
you're already dead.

06:15.643 --> 06:16.910
Enjoy the eggs, kids.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.746
They're mediocre,
you'll fit right in.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.681
Burn in hell, Edge.

06:22.450 --> 06:25.085
I hear the company
is fantastic.

06:25.118 --> 06:28.622
Come on, what, are you napping
in my car? Let's go.

06:35.028 --> 06:37.097
Hi, Richard, thank you so much
for taking my call.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.666
-You got it.
-First time caller here.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.033
Let me ask you something.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.835
What do you know?
I mean, from your...

06:41.869 --> 06:43.837
Your...

06:43.871 --> 06:45.038
I put my investments into...

07:30.150 --> 07:34.187
DOC rounded up
most of the prisoners
who escaped Albatross Bay

07:34.221 --> 07:37.024
during Reign's attack
except Thomas Coville.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.693
Let's see if we can get a quote
from the warden on the record.

07:39.727 --> 07:41.161
Art department, what's up?

07:41.194 --> 07:44.898
The Parks Conservancy is having
a black-tie gala tonight.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.634
All the city's major donors
are gonna be there.

07:46.667 --> 07:49.970
I feel like an ace reporter
would be able to find a story.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.841
Okay,
you guys heard the boss.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.676
Who's headed to the gala?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.579
I got a story for ya!

07:58.612 --> 08:00.814
What the hell happened to you?

08:00.848 --> 08:02.683
-I survived.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.117
An attempt on my life.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.954
How about this,
why don't you try 1,500 words

08:06.987 --> 08:10.991
on how this deranged
trust-fund baby hacked
into my car

08:11.024 --> 08:13.927
and tried to steer me
off the edge of this damn city.

08:13.961 --> 08:17.097
Wait, wait, you're accusing me
of trying to kill you?

08:17.130 --> 08:18.431
Oh, that's rich.

08:18.465 --> 08:21.735
Look, whatever happened to you,
Lena had nothing to do with it.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.003
Yeah, so why don't you
just turn around

08:23.036 --> 08:24.872
and go accuse
one of the other 50 people

08:24.905 --> 08:27.140
who despise you in this city.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.277
She shows up
where I have breakfast,

08:30.310 --> 08:33.881
hangs out at the valet stand
just a little bit too long,

08:33.914 --> 08:37.685
tells me to go, what was it,
"Burn in hell"?

08:37.718 --> 08:39.286
And then somehow, mysteriously,

08:39.319 --> 08:44.825
my car steers itself
off the road,
explodes into the water.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.760
Coincidence? I don't think so.

08:46.794 --> 08:49.863
I don't put hits on people
no matter how much
I despise them.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.734
That's right, you like
to do the dirty work yourself.

08:55.603 --> 08:58.171
Here I am, sister.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.041
Why don't you man up
and finish the job?

09:01.074 --> 09:03.110
Why don't you find the exit,

09:04.044 --> 09:05.946
or I'll find it for you.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.883
You better get ready
to finish what you started,

09:09.917 --> 09:11.218
because you wound me up

09:11.251 --> 09:13.186
and I'm not gonna rest
until it's over.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.722
And I never lose.

09:14.755 --> 09:15.923
Got it?

09:21.962 --> 09:23.296
He's gone.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.198
And security knows better
than to let him in again.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.934
He's not gonna come back
and try again in person.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.069
This was
an uncharacteristic outburst.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.071
I've never seen him so angry.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.640
He's gonna come back
at me twice as hard.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.074
This is never gonna stop.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.843
But you're not the one
who is trying to kill him.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.878
No. He's tried
to kill Lena plenty of times

09:37.911 --> 09:39.212
and she's never retaliated.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.948
So, someone out there
is trying to kill him.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.616
He's got
no shortage of enemies,

09:42.650 --> 09:44.652
but, like you said,
this is uncharacteristic
for him.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.053
Edge is too good
at covering his tracks

09:46.086 --> 09:48.155
to have somebody
build a case against him.

09:48.188 --> 09:51.091
I mean, we don't even have
enough for a damning story.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.960
We should really
be focused on this car hack.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.394
Yeah, you're right.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.296
I'm just tired of this cycle
of violence, okay?

09:56.329 --> 09:57.965
I just want these threats,

09:57.998 --> 10:00.701
these attacks,
these recriminations...

10:00.734 --> 10:02.836
You know, I've seen it
ruin my mother's life

10:02.870 --> 10:04.838
and my brother's.
I just want it to stop.

10:04.872 --> 10:07.240
Well, that's what
we're here for.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.876
Let your friends help you.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.750
So, what do you see?

10:19.152 --> 10:20.153
Nothing.

10:21.889 --> 10:24.157
Is that a good thing?

10:24.191 --> 10:27.728
Well, it's neither good
nor bad.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.998
It just means that whatever's
causing the blackouts

10:31.031 --> 10:33.000
isn't showing up on the images.

10:34.702 --> 10:35.869
Okay.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.272
So, where do we go from here?

10:39.306 --> 10:43.343
We send the images to an expert
along with some blood work.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.014
Are you okay?
What are you thinkin'?

10:47.047 --> 10:49.983
Yeah, I'm just tired
of all the lying.

10:50.017 --> 10:54.021
Lies to Lena
about my whereabouts,

10:54.054 --> 10:56.223
about the press conferences
and the board meetings,

10:56.256 --> 11:00.193
and the earnings calls,
and just all of it.

11:00.227 --> 11:03.263
I lie and I tell her
that everything's fine.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.398
I thought you told her
about the work trip?

11:05.432 --> 11:09.236
I told her that
my adopted mother was
in the hospital.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.271
So, that's a lie

11:11.304 --> 11:13.173
on a lie on a lie.

11:13.206 --> 11:16.043
So, maybe it's time
for some truth.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.812
The truth is that
I'm becoming a burden.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.248
To Lena.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.850
To L-Corp. To you.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.352
To my friends. To my daughter.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.221
I don't wanna be that person.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.493
I'm afraid of needles.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.062
It's really not that bad.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.064
I'm gonna make it painless.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.232
-Okay.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.476
Hmm Painless.

11:49.509 --> 11:53.113
Your being sick isn't a burden
to anyone.

11:54.281 --> 11:57.084
Lena might be your boss...
Hang on to that.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.386
But she's also your friend.

12:00.888 --> 12:03.490
So, maybe you should try
letting her in.

12:03.523 --> 12:08.095
Alex, I've handled everything
on my own since I was 16.

12:08.128 --> 12:11.131
Ruby, college, work,
everything.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.866
Been white-knuckling
my whole life.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.335
It's bad enough I included you
in all these problems.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.137
So, I'm...

12:17.170 --> 12:19.973
-I'll be fine.
-I know what it's like

12:20.007 --> 12:23.110
to be afraid
to let other people in.

12:23.143 --> 12:27.080
I have always been used
to dealing with things
in my life on my own.

12:28.548 --> 12:29.883
So,

12:30.884 --> 12:32.419
after Maggie and I broke up,

12:34.054 --> 12:36.489
the thought of talking about it
was terrifying.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.227
But Kara being Kara,

12:40.260 --> 12:42.162
she wouldn't let me shut down.

12:44.531 --> 12:48.135
She forced me to let her in

12:48.168 --> 12:51.872
so that we could
figure things out together.

12:51.905 --> 12:55.843
That's the only way
that I'm getting through
any of this.

12:55.876 --> 12:59.112
And I am not about to let you
make the same mistake

12:59.146 --> 13:01.048
that I almost made.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.485
Okay.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.923
I'll talk to Kara and Lena
today.

13:10.924 --> 13:13.460
Now, that is a good choice.

13:13.493 --> 13:17.030
-You get a lollipop.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.431
I'll take it.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.500
It's my favorite.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.571
Okay. That was my source
at NCPD.

13:24.604 --> 13:28.341
They just salvaged Edge's car
and there's no sign
of tampering.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.078
You think Edge
did this himself

13:31.111 --> 13:32.412
To frame me?

13:32.445 --> 13:34.281
Edge is crazy,
but he's not suicidal.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.116
Well, whoever
hacked his car,

13:36.149 --> 13:39.286
it's above and beyond anything
the NCPD has ever dealt with.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.321
What about the guy who hacked
Maxwell Lord's limousine

13:41.354 --> 13:43.456
and tried to drive him
off a cliff?

13:43.490 --> 13:46.359
Yeah, I thought of that guy
too, but there's no connection
to Edge.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.463
Ms. Luthor, the usual.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.499
Thanks, Eve.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.234
Guys, listen,
we're been at this for hours,

13:54.267 --> 13:56.403
how do we not have any leads?

13:56.436 --> 13:58.205
Maybe we're barking up
the wrong tree.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.473
Well, we can start
with the attempts on your life,

14:00.507 --> 14:02.309
and maybe

14:02.342 --> 14:04.311
that'll get us
into Edge's inner circle

14:04.344 --> 14:06.479
and look for new suspects.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.251
It's poison. Go, I've got her.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.286
Eve! Eve!

14:14.554 --> 14:16.223
The coffee?

14:16.256 --> 14:18.025
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mr. Olsen,
did you want one too?

14:18.058 --> 14:19.259
No, where did you get it from?

14:19.292 --> 14:21.128
The cart, where I always
get it.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.369
What did you give her?

15:03.270 --> 15:04.571
What did you give her?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.285
What happened?

15:18.318 --> 15:20.587
Edge tried to poison her,
it was in her coffee.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.323
Two-hundred milligrams
phenobarbital, stat.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.325
Come on, Lena.
Calm down, calm down.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.294
Two liters of saline,
run it open.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.429
I want a radial artery line
and two red tox.

15:29.462 --> 15:32.099
Blood pressure, 70 over palp.
Pulse is 30 and falling.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.633
I need to know what poison
he used.

15:33.666 --> 15:36.169
I don't know.

15:36.203 --> 15:39.172
Mustard gas, cyanide,
strychnine.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.180
Almonds. That's cyanide.

15:47.214 --> 15:49.449
Fifty mils
of sodium thiosulfate.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.619
-About two, three minutes.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.422
Cyanide is circulating
through her system.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.190
Her brain and her heart
are going to shut down.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.592
I need to slow down
her circulation in order
for this to work.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.660
How do you slow it down?

16:00.693 --> 16:02.129
Induce hypothermia.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.396
I can do it. Let me do it.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.532
Hold on.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.370
Okay, that's good.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.145
Come on, come on, come on.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.412
Come on, Lena.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.021
Normal sinus rhythm.

16:28.055 --> 16:30.157
-You saved her.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.491
No, we did.

16:44.437 --> 16:47.274
You're a hard man to get
an appointment with, Mr. Edge.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.314
Let me go.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.748
I don't think you want me
to do that.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.150
Okay.

16:57.717 --> 16:58.751
What do you want?

16:58.785 --> 17:00.687
You poisoned Lena Luthor.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.490
No, no, no, no. That doesn't
sound like something
I would do.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.558
You get people
to do your dirty work for you

17:05.592 --> 17:07.794
and then you kill them
before they can talk.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.629
I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.199
Then you'll be happy
to know she survived.

17:12.232 --> 17:16.669
No, actually, I despise her.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.438
There's a lot of other people
in this city

17:18.471 --> 17:20.773
who'd be happy
to rid this place of a Luthor.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.476
Maybe you wanna dangle
one of them over the side
of a building

17:23.510 --> 17:25.812
before you make an enemy
out of me.

17:27.747 --> 17:30.383
All right, okay.
All right, okay. Okay.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.087
See, that's where you're wrong.

17:34.121 --> 17:35.755
I am your enemy, Edge.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.392
So, you better tread carefully.

17:39.426 --> 17:42.595
Because if anything
happens to Lena Luthor,

17:42.629 --> 17:44.697
I will find you.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.267
And you won't be walking away
from that.

17:55.342 --> 17:59.179
Alex says
Lena will wake up soon.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.481
I suggest she does that
at CatCo

18:01.514 --> 18:04.484
and not at a super secret
government organization.

18:05.252 --> 18:06.419
Yeah.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.257
You did a brave thing
back there,

18:10.290 --> 18:11.658
risking your identity
to save her.

18:11.691 --> 18:14.161
Well, it was what needed
to be done.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.595
Taking action, as always.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.898
Not always.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.801
Reign and the other
Worldkillers
are still out there.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.604
Planning.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.807
And I'm just waiting for them
to make their next strike.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.613
I wish there was something
I could do. Anything.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.548
Don't get ahead of yourself,
Kara.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.350
The Worldkillers will come,

18:37.384 --> 18:39.619
and when they do, I trust
you'll be ready.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.621
Right now your job is
to protect the people of Earth

18:41.654 --> 18:44.591
and be there for your friends.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.894
This world is a crazy place
right now.

18:47.927 --> 18:52.432
People are acting, reacting,
escalating behaviors.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.501
Like what Morgan Edge did
to Lena.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.336
What our lawmakers are doing,

18:56.369 --> 18:59.272
sniping at each other,
going round and round
in circles.

18:59.306 --> 19:02.742
It's not doing any good.

19:02.775 --> 19:06.379
It reminds me of Mars
before the civil war.

19:08.281 --> 19:11.384
But, like my father said then,

19:11.418 --> 19:16.189
there is great power in being
the calm at the center
of the storm.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.858
A beacon to show the way.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.129
Supergirl

19:23.162 --> 19:28.201
is here to remind us on Earth
about what's best in ourselves.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.969
That's what's most important.

19:30.002 --> 19:33.440
It's more important than
if you ever were
to catch another bullet.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.835
I had the strangest dream.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.405
You were flying,
and you were carrying me.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.340
I was?

20:07.374 --> 20:11.944
Like Supergirl? That's...
I wish.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.481
Why do I feel like I've been
hit by a truck?

20:17.417 --> 20:18.885
You were poisoned.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.488
It was the coffee.

20:24.491 --> 20:25.925
Kara reacted very quickly

20:25.958 --> 20:28.728
and the paramedics came
and they gave you an antidote.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.630
They said you need to rest.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.600
It was Edge, wasn't it?

20:33.633 --> 20:35.468
-Yeah.

20:35.502 --> 20:38.305
No. He didn't do it
himself, he hired a hit man.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.606
And now that hit man is dead.

20:39.639 --> 20:42.275
So, Edge is gonna get away
scot

20:42.309 --> 20:43.376
For now.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.877
You know, Reign was right.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.580
Scumbags like Edge need
to be put down, okay?

20:47.614 --> 20:49.616
He wants a war,
then he's got one.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.451
I'm the only one
who can protect myself.

20:51.484 --> 20:54.020
Lena, no, you are not a killer.

20:54.053 --> 20:57.490
Yeah, Kara?
Maybe you don't know what I am.

20:57.524 --> 20:58.925
Well, hey, I know you.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.494
You're not thinking clearly
right now, okay?

21:01.528 --> 21:02.895
We're not out of options.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.498
We have a lead, okay?
We weren't able to find

21:05.532 --> 21:07.800
any fragment of the bullet,
no exit wound,

21:07.834 --> 21:09.669
no shrapnel, nothing,
no casings.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.371
So, it just vanished?

21:11.404 --> 21:13.606
Yeah, it's some really weird
futuristic technology.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.643
But if we can find out who
can manufacture
a bullet like that,

21:16.676 --> 21:17.944
we can find the shooter.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.548
Lena, I give you my word,

21:21.581 --> 21:23.850
Edge will not get away
with this again.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.419
Okay.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.856
I feel better.

21:29.889 --> 21:30.890
Good.

22:20.473 --> 22:22.409
You followed my breadcrumbs.

22:22.442 --> 22:25.044
More quickly, I expect,
than your brother would have.

22:25.077 --> 22:27.447
I'm impressed.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.482
Now, come give your mother
a hug.

22:35.422 --> 22:38.591
Okay. So, no hug.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.727
It's probably too much to ask.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.061
The disappearing bullets

22:42.094 --> 22:44.997
were an inspired breadcrumb,
don't you think?

22:45.031 --> 22:46.599
Worked like a charm.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.635
What are you doing here,
Mother?

22:49.702 --> 22:51.103
What do you think?

22:51.137 --> 22:53.039
A man has been trying
to assassinate my daughter,

22:53.072 --> 22:54.607
I came back to kill him.

22:55.041 --> 22:55.842
How sweet.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.579
No, what are you really doing
here?

23:00.780 --> 23:03.583
You know, you really hurt me,
Lena.

23:03.616 --> 23:07.520
No matter how hard I try
to show it, you still doubt
my love for you.

23:07.554 --> 23:10.923
Do you know of any other mother
who would kill
for her daughter?

23:11.758 --> 23:13.626
No, I don't.

23:13.660 --> 23:16.763
It's probably a good thing
for society.

23:16.796 --> 23:20.567
Speaking of society,
I've risked everything
to come back here,

23:21.468 --> 23:23.836
but it was worth it.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.974
That man has picked
on the wrong family.

23:28.007 --> 23:30.109
I don't need your help, Mother.

23:30.142 --> 23:32.812
If I wanted him gone,
I would just do it myself.

23:32.845 --> 23:35.515
Oh, I'm well aware.

23:35.548 --> 23:41.087
I'll never forget the time
Cindy Ryan stole
your boyfriend.

23:41.120 --> 23:44.691
Took you months of planning,
but you exacted your revenge.

23:44.724 --> 23:46.626
You outed her diary,

23:46.659 --> 23:49.529
publicly humiliated her,
ruined her life.

23:49.562 --> 23:50.863
It was fantastic.

23:50.897 --> 23:52.799
It was also the fifth grade,
Mother.

23:52.832 --> 23:55.802
There you go again,
devaluing yourself.

23:55.835 --> 23:59.706
You know, Lex was brilliant,
but he was a hothead.

23:59.739 --> 24:03.510
You're equally as fiendish,
but savvier.

24:03.543 --> 24:05.778
You have
a cold-blooded talent.

24:05.812 --> 24:08.014
You can plot three moves ahead.

24:08.047 --> 24:11.584
Use your brain.
When you finally own that,

24:13.653 --> 24:15.588
you'll be great.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.757
Other than Edge's obsession
with me,

24:18.591 --> 24:20.226
I am great.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.829
At CatCo? Please.

24:22.862 --> 24:25.598
I've been keeping tabs on you.

24:25.632 --> 24:26.933
What happened to all the things

24:26.966 --> 24:29.101
you told me you wanted
to accomplish at L

24:29.135 --> 24:33.172
Your technology
has the capacity
to change the world,

24:33.205 --> 24:34.707
build the future.

24:34.741 --> 24:37.176
You gave all that up
to buy a vanity business?

24:37.209 --> 24:40.580
Talking heads who regurgitate
the news?

24:40.613 --> 24:42.114
I can't understand it.

24:43.716 --> 24:46.218
Why would you want
to be Cat Grant

24:47.754 --> 24:50.022
when you could be Lena Luthor?

24:52.258 --> 24:54.126
Let me do this.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.696
I know you, Lena.

24:56.729 --> 25:00.767
You loathe this man
and wanna kill him
as much as I do.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.905
Even if that were true,

25:06.739 --> 25:08.841
I'd never act on it.

25:08.875 --> 25:11.744
Which is why you need
your mother.

25:11.778 --> 25:14.280
It'll be done by the end
of the night.

25:14.313 --> 25:17.884
And then, maybe,
we can finally work together.

25:20.119 --> 25:23.723
Please let me prove to you
how much I love you.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.125
Okay.

25:27.259 --> 25:28.728
Good girl.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.651
Are you okay?

25:51.684 --> 25:53.853
Yeah. There's something I--

25:53.886 --> 25:57.023
Hey, Kara, Lena,
can we talk?

25:58.858 --> 26:01.928
Sam, I'm so sorry
you've been going through this.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.329
I wish you'd have come
to us sooner.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.598
You shouldn't have had
to go through this alone.

26:05.632 --> 26:08.300
I know. I'm sorry I didn't.

26:08.334 --> 26:09.836
I...

26:09.869 --> 26:11.671
I've always had
to take care of myself,

26:11.704 --> 26:17.076
you know, and, I guess
I was just afraid that
if I let you in,

26:17.109 --> 26:18.945
you know, let myself
feel vulnerable,

26:18.978 --> 26:21.180
I would completely fall apart.

26:21.213 --> 26:23.282
Yeah, but falling apart
is okay.

26:23.315 --> 26:25.351
'Cause you'd have us
to pick up the pieces.

26:25.384 --> 26:28.154
Yes, if it were just me,
then that would be one thing,

26:28.187 --> 26:29.956
but it's not.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.194
When Ruby was first born,

26:36.829 --> 26:40.933
the nurse handed her
to me in the hospital

26:40.967 --> 26:45.938
and she wrapped her tiny hand
around my finger,

26:45.972 --> 26:49.375
and I just stared at her
in awe.

26:49.408 --> 26:53.212
And I swore that I would
always protect her,
no matter what.

26:54.413 --> 26:57.917
So, my greatest fear...

26:57.950 --> 27:02.054
is that something will happen
to me and I won't be around
to protect her.

27:03.422 --> 27:05.091
All Ruby has is me.

27:06.158 --> 27:09.128
So, if I'm not here...

27:09.161 --> 27:11.330
If I'm not around,
then what will happen to her?

27:12.732 --> 27:14.233
I'm scared.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.404
But we're your family.

27:18.437 --> 27:20.406
And we're Ruby's family too.

27:20.439 --> 27:24.376
And that little girl has got
the fiercest mama
on the planet.

27:25.912 --> 27:30.750
And you got to remember
you're not alone.

27:30.783 --> 27:33.419
You have no idea
what that means to me.

27:33.452 --> 27:37.289
Well, good, because all we have
to focus on now
is getting you better.

27:37.323 --> 27:38.891
Yeah.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.005
Lena?

27:54.473 --> 27:56.976
What did you want to tell me,
what's going on?

27:59.846 --> 28:01.781
I tried to kill Edge.

28:01.814 --> 28:03.249
What

28:03.282 --> 28:06.786
After he poisoned the children
and tried to frame me.

28:06.819 --> 28:11.423
I went to his office with
a loaded gun and the intent
to kill.

28:11.457 --> 28:14.160
Only reason he's still alive
is he outsmarted me.

28:16.262 --> 28:19.465
Oh. Okay, okay.

28:19.498 --> 28:22.802
Okay, well, the good news is,
you didn't.

28:22.835 --> 28:24.203
Yeah.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.340
My mother is back.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.376
Lillian.

28:30.409 --> 28:32.979
She manufactured
the disintegrating bullets.

28:33.012 --> 28:34.847
I just saw her.

28:36.015 --> 28:38.851
And as darkly twisted
as Lillian is,

28:38.885 --> 28:41.253
she made me realize
two things about myself.

28:42.855 --> 28:46.392
One, I very well may be
a killer.

28:46.425 --> 28:48.160
No, you're not a killer.

28:48.194 --> 28:50.863
No, not as yet. But I do have
the emotional range of Medea.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.100
And what's number two?

28:54.867 --> 28:56.502
I'm smart.

28:56.535 --> 29:00.106
Cunning. Strategic.
I think steps ahead
of most people.

29:00.139 --> 29:02.108
And you needed your mother
to remind you of that?

29:02.141 --> 29:04.944
Lena, come on,
you're a chess prodigy,

29:04.977 --> 29:06.846
I've seen your trophies.

29:06.879 --> 29:09.849
You know, I always confuse
my cunning
and my emotional insecurity,

29:09.882 --> 29:13.886
and thought of it all
as something to be suppressed.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.925
And then, when I saw Lillian,
I had an epiphany.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.493
I can separate the two parts.

29:24.296 --> 29:26.098
My mother is gonna try
and kill Edge.

29:26.132 --> 29:27.399
She's gonna do it tonight.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.068
I have an idea
about how she'll do it,

29:29.101 --> 29:30.970
but I don't have
the full picture.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.304
And if we're gonna save him,

29:32.338 --> 29:35.141
I'm gonna need to use my wit

29:35.174 --> 29:37.376
and I'm gonna need your help.

29:37.409 --> 29:38.444
You got it.

29:43.549 --> 29:45.451
Of course I'm happy
to be here, Simon.

29:45.484 --> 29:48.120
I donated $10 million
to the Parks department

29:48.154 --> 29:49.956
so our beautiful city
could have more trees.

29:49.989 --> 29:54.060
After all, who doesn't like
a little more oxygen, huh?

29:55.427 --> 29:57.029
Good to see ya.

29:57.864 --> 29:59.165
Bingo.

30:04.070 --> 30:05.537
Any sign of him?

30:05.571 --> 30:07.606
I don't know.
Look for the shiniest
red dress,

30:07.639 --> 30:10.609
and I'm sure you'll find
the mouth-breather Edge
behind it.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.344
Well, you were almost right.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.082
Shiny red lipstick.

30:17.984 --> 30:20.486
I should have known about
the ear piece.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.321
Oh, I'll handle him.

30:22.354 --> 30:25.257
I'm professionally crafty.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.094
Hi.

30:28.127 --> 30:30.196
I'm Kara Danvers,
CatCo Worldwide.

30:30.229 --> 30:32.631
I just have a few questions
for Mr. Edge,

30:32.664 --> 30:36.035
so I'll just shuffle on back.

30:36.068 --> 30:37.336
Not so fast, sweetheart.

30:39.906 --> 30:41.107
What the...

30:42.441 --> 30:45.311
Don't grab women, sweetheart.

30:47.313 --> 30:51.383
I've got two pools
and a very large hot tub.

30:51.417 --> 30:54.553
You know, you really should be
careful of standing water.

30:54.586 --> 30:57.123
It's usually riddled
with disease.

30:59.058 --> 31:01.027
I'll catch up with you later.

31:02.628 --> 31:05.131
How in the hell
did you get past my security?

31:05.164 --> 31:08.600
I don't know, it's almost
as easy as poisoning
a cup of coffee.

31:08.634 --> 31:10.903
That was low, even for you.

31:10.937 --> 31:14.373
At least crashing a plane had
a certain kind
of elaborate elegance,

31:14.406 --> 31:17.509
but poisoning? That's just
a coward's method.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.345
No idea what you're
talking about.

31:19.378 --> 31:22.148
Yeah. You know, I thought you'd
say that. So...

31:24.450 --> 31:26.385
What is that, some sort
of a weapon?

31:26.418 --> 31:27.987
A bomb?

31:28.020 --> 31:30.289
You gonna try to kill me
in public?

31:30.322 --> 31:33.125
No. I'm actually here
to save you.

31:33.159 --> 31:34.593
From who, yourself?

31:34.626 --> 31:36.128
My mother.

31:36.162 --> 31:37.997
She's the one that hacked
into your car

31:38.030 --> 31:42.034
and she's gonna try
and kill you tonight,
unless I stop her.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.471
Lillian Luthor.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.306
The world's most wanted
terrorist

31:47.339 --> 31:49.408
came out of hiding
to kill Morgan Edge?

31:49.441 --> 31:51.277
-I'm impressed.
-Hmm.

31:52.044 --> 31:53.212
But why?

31:53.245 --> 31:55.247
Because you screwed
with her daughter.

32:10.562 --> 32:13.399
My mother will kill you tonight
unless you give me
a confession.

32:13.432 --> 32:16.135
I have nothing to confess to.

32:16.168 --> 32:17.603
Such a small thing
for your life.

32:17.636 --> 32:20.539
I mean, granted, you will
spend the rest of it in prison,

32:20.572 --> 32:22.608
but let's not sweat
the details.

32:29.748 --> 32:31.617
That drone is
programmed to kill you.

32:33.485 --> 32:34.753
Tick-tock.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.222
You're insane, you know that?

32:36.255 --> 32:37.589
Admit you tried to kill me.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.492
Come on, Lena.

32:49.268 --> 32:50.536
What do I pay you guys for?

33:00.746 --> 33:03.115
-Okay.

33:09.655 --> 33:12.258
I did it. All of it.

33:12.291 --> 33:15.294
The lead poisoning,
I tried to kill you.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.596
I tried to cover my tracks.
Just call that thing off.

33:28.407 --> 33:30.242
Give me the tape. Now!

33:30.276 --> 33:32.144
What didn't you
let me kill him?

33:33.612 --> 33:34.646
I found another way.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.348
There is
no other way.

33:36.382 --> 33:39.151
You're a Luthor,
you should be proud of it.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.699
You're three steps ahead?
I'm four.

33:57.703 --> 34:00.306
Suit's a bit much,
don't you think?

34:00.339 --> 34:02.108
Says the girl in the cape.

34:02.141 --> 34:07.379
Holy crap, is that
the Lexosuit? That is awesome.

34:07.413 --> 34:11.550
It's gonna be awesome
when Supergirl freakin'
destroys that thing.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.752
Because, you know,
that is dangerous.

34:13.785 --> 34:15.554
Tell J'onn to assemble
the strike team,
I'm getting down there.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.356
There isn't time.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.558
Hack the drone she used
to fire on Edge.

34:19.591 --> 34:21.460
On my mark, we'll use it
against her.

34:38.277 --> 34:39.645
I'm sorry, did that hit you?

34:41.847 --> 34:44.316
Guess he got over his allergy
to lead.

35:06.872 --> 35:08.540
Uh, Winn?

35:08.574 --> 35:09.775
Sorry, these are not the drones
you're looking for.

35:09.808 --> 35:11.143
We're working
on the right ones.

35:11.177 --> 35:12.311
Please hurry.

35:25.324 --> 35:27.426
Ha-ha! I think I found
the right drone.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.628
Mon-El, I've hacked
the drone, it is ready.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.499
Keep her busy.

35:33.532 --> 35:34.866
I've got your back, I promise.

35:41.273 --> 35:44.810
I told you if I had to see you
again, you wouldn't
be walking out.

35:55.621 --> 35:57.656
Ass.

35:57.689 --> 36:00.626
Now, that's the understatement
of the century.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.498
Please keep trying.

36:06.532 --> 36:08.434
If I remember,
the last time you did this,

36:08.467 --> 36:09.868
it caused you to bleed.

36:25.917 --> 36:28.920
Ms. Luthor, glad to see
you're okay.

36:28.954 --> 36:30.656
Yeah.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.558
I could say the same about you.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.660
Well, it looks like
you got what you came for.

36:43.001 --> 36:45.737
You know these charges
are never gonna stick, right?

36:46.505 --> 36:47.939
You better run.

36:47.973 --> 36:50.676
'Cause when I get back,
I'm gonna crush you.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.444
Well, you know where
to find me.

36:52.478 --> 36:53.945
My name's on the building.

36:57.616 --> 36:58.917
Thank you for letting me
borrow this.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.786
Although, I may have to
expense you another one,

37:00.819 --> 37:02.721
'cause I think the police
are gonna wanna look at this.

37:02.754 --> 37:04.456
Oh, well,
it actually belongs to CatCo,

37:04.490 --> 37:06.925
so, technically,
it's your property.

37:06.958 --> 37:09.728
Yeah. You wanna know
why I'm not a killer?

37:11.062 --> 37:12.598
Friends.

37:12.631 --> 37:13.865
Well, that's what friends
are for.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.867
We get each other
through the dark times,

37:15.901 --> 37:17.969
like you did with Mon-El.

37:21.039 --> 37:22.641
Yeah, Kara...

37:24.510 --> 37:26.612
I saw Mon-El.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.747
He was here with Supergirl--

37:28.780 --> 37:31.817
Yeah. It's complicated.
I'll tell you about it.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.485
You guys okay?

37:33.519 --> 37:34.986
Yeah, yeah.

37:35.020 --> 37:37.856
I am actually better
than I have been in months.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.958
You missed all the fun,
Jimmy Olsen.

37:40.826 --> 37:41.927
Excuse me.

37:52.438 --> 37:55.574
I'd hoped this time
would be different between us.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.743
It was different, Mother.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.044
For the first time I could own

37:59.077 --> 38:00.912
the parts of myself
that were similar to you

38:00.946 --> 38:03.449
without resorting to evil.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.517
You did make me wake up,
though.

38:06.818 --> 38:09.521
There's so much I wanna do.

38:09.555 --> 38:12.424
I'm gonna need my Luthor smarts
to do them.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.560
Well, at least
it wasn't a total waste.

38:15.627 --> 38:16.962
You should've let me kill him.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.098
You know, one day
you'll understand

38:20.131 --> 38:21.933
there's a different way
of doing things.

38:21.967 --> 38:24.803
Maybe you can enlighten me
when you visit me in prison.

38:25.571 --> 38:27.439
If I'm still there.

38:35.981 --> 38:36.982
Yes.

38:38.517 --> 38:39.785
Thank you.

38:41.820 --> 38:46.692
Okay, so, all the test results
came back clear.

38:46.725 --> 38:50.095
No tumor, no blood disorders,
nothing.

38:50.128 --> 38:52.998
You are as healthy
as an Olympic athlete.

38:54.900 --> 38:55.934
Really?

38:55.967 --> 38:57.936
Sam, this is
a really good thing.

38:57.969 --> 39:00.606
All of the worst possibilities
have been ruled out.

39:00.639 --> 39:02.874
No, I know, I know.
It's just...

39:02.908 --> 39:05.911
I mean, if it's nothing,
then what's happening to me?

39:05.944 --> 39:08.980
We'll figure it out, okay?
I promise.

39:10.716 --> 39:14.753
But, for right now,
just take the good news.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.555
Alex is right.

39:16.588 --> 39:17.989
Go home to Ruby, enjoy the now.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.858
Every second of this
is important to you

39:19.891 --> 39:21.960
and it's important
to your daughter.

39:23.962 --> 39:26.598
Okay. No, yeah, you're right.

39:26.632 --> 39:28.534
Thank you, guys.

39:28.567 --> 39:31.870
I honestly...
I don't know how I lived
my life without you guys.

39:31.903 --> 39:32.971
Thank you.

39:38.577 --> 39:40.078
I'll figure it out.

39:40.111 --> 39:41.647
We all will.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.023
No.

39:52.057 --> 39:54.860
You seem to be everywhere
these days, don't you?

39:54.893 --> 39:56.928
Well, I'm gonna help
while I'm here.

39:59.898 --> 40:01.433
And, if you don't mind me
saying so,

40:01.467 --> 40:05.504
I think we made
a pretty good team last night.

40:05.537 --> 40:09.040
Yeah, well, that idea you had
to use Lillian's drones
against her,

40:09.074 --> 40:12.578
that was a good idea.

40:12.611 --> 40:16.882
Yeah, thanks. Brainy and I did
a similar thing
against Computo once.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.517
I've learned a lot
in seven years.

40:18.550 --> 40:19.818
Yeah.

40:20.218 --> 40:21.587
Hey.

40:24.556 --> 40:27.793
Look, I know this is tough.

40:29.561 --> 40:31.062
And I may not know much
right now,

40:31.096 --> 40:33.699
but I do know
that I'm committed

40:33.732 --> 40:36.101
to being that hero
that you taught me to be.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.036
I hope you know that.

40:41.072 --> 40:42.808
I know.

40:42.841 --> 40:44.175
What...
what's that you ask?

40:44.209 --> 40:46.878
Has Winslow Schott,
your favorite human,

40:46.912 --> 40:49.815
finally cracked the case,
and maybe come up
with a hot lead?

40:49.848 --> 40:51.082
What did you find?

40:51.116 --> 40:53.218
I cross-referenced
the meteor impact sites

40:53.251 --> 40:56.655
with news reports and hospital
records to search
for anomalies,

40:56.688 --> 40:58.557
and let's see what we
came up with.

40:58.590 --> 41:01.960
This guy had super strength,
but turns out he was just
a Maaldorian.

41:01.993 --> 41:05.230
Then we have a Coluan,
we have a Phorian,

41:05.263 --> 41:08.734
and then there are these four.

41:09.835 --> 41:11.837
There's no reason
for these anomalies.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.705
They've survived
horrific car crashes,

41:13.739 --> 41:17.108
falls off of cliffs.
The doctors said
it was unprecedented.

41:17.142 --> 41:18.544
Like a miracle that
they are alive,

41:18.577 --> 41:21.146
and completely unharmed.

41:21.179 --> 41:23.749
So, two of these
are our Worldkillers, huh?

41:24.249 --> 41:26.151
Uh, maybe, yeah.

41:26.184 --> 41:30.722
But which one,
or ones, is gonna take
a lot more research.

41:30.756 --> 41:32.190
It's her.

41:32.223 --> 41:34.059
Her

41:35.260 --> 41:36.762
I just do.

41:39.698 --> 41:42.634
Okay. So, what do we do?

41:43.669 --> 41:44.936
We go get her.
