spoon me and stay soft.

It's just, I'm so happy to be

11:23.800 --> 11:25.299

11:25.301 --> 11:27.885
I was very close to my
neighbors, the Kleins.

11:27.887 --> 11:30.638
In fact, they called me
their honorary Jew.

11:30.640 --> 11:31.555
Stop now.

11:31.557 --> 11:32.673

And she was nice enough
to put it on my head

18:49.430 --> 18:51.513
and I felt what that feels like.

18:51.515 --> 18:53.182
And then Bubby blew on my soup

18:53.184 --> 18:55.250
before she ate the non-kosher cupcake.

18:55.252 --> 18:59.605
Wait, Bubby ate a non-kosher cupcake?

18:59.607 --> 19:01.724
It's a shanda!

19:01.726 --> 19:02.891
It is a shanda.

19:02.893 --> 19:04.560
I'm hoping shanda means

19:04.562 --> 19:06.595
you're forgiven and
we'll pay you anyway.

19:06.597 --> 19:07.946
We are not taking any money.

19:07.948 --> 19:10.932
That's right, you're not
taking anything.

19:10.934 --> 19:13.786
Except for this compress.

19:13.788 --> 19:16.238
Feel better.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.123
Now go, get out of my sight.

19:18.125 --> 19:19.730
And don't wear short skirts.

19:19.850 --> 19:21.158
Esther Rachel,

19:21.278 --> 19:22.544
I wanna talk to you about your son

19:22.546 --> 19:23.746
Shmuley's behavior today.

19:23.748 --> 19:24.930
What are you talking about?

19:24.932 --> 19:25.981
What did my Shmuley do?

19:25.983 --> 19:27.549
I'll tell you what he did.

19:27.551 --> 19:29.218
He became a man.

19:29.220 --> 19:30.336
That's all he did.

19:30.338 --> 19:31.553
Right, Caroline?

19:31.555 --> 19:33.005
I'll say he became a man.

19:33.007 --> 19:34.306
What are you talking about?

19:34.308 --> 19:35.290
Shmuley!

19:35.292 --> 19:36.342
Stay out of it,

19:36.344 --> 19:37.626
this is not our family.

19:37.628 --> 19:38.977
You and I don't have a family.

19:38.979 --> 19:39.961
They still do.

19:39.963 --> 19:41.847
Let the police tell her about him.

19:41.849 --> 19:43.899
So about my Shmuley.

19:43.901 --> 19:45.150
What do you have to say?

19:45.152 --> 19:50.322
Mazel tov, he's a wonderful,
wonderful boy.

19:50.324 --> 19:52.157
Oh, there you are.

19:52.159 --> 19:55.811
Shmuley, David, say goodbye to
the cupcake girls.

19:55.813 --> 19:58.980
Both: Nice to meet you.

20:00.849 --> 20:01.965
Thank you.

20:02.085 --> 20:03.702
So I see no Max.

20:03.704 --> 20:05.170
She still out sick?

20:05.172 --> 20:06.288
It's her first night back.

20:06.290 --> 20:07.456
She should be here any minute.

20:07.458 --> 20:08.540
Did you wanna order something

20:08.542 --> 20:09.758
or wait for your boyfriend?

20:09.760 --> 20:14.930
Oh, see, this is sad story.

20:14.932 --> 20:19.635
Uh, he broke off with me
to date other woman.

20:19.637 --> 20:22.838
And she had penis.

20:26.976 --> 20:32.498
Yeah, I can't compete with that.

20:32.500 --> 20:33.532
Hi, Earl.

20:33.534 --> 20:35.617
There she is, my long lost love.

20:35.619 --> 20:36.652
How you feeling, Max?

20:36.654 --> 20:38.987
I'm pretty good.

20:38.989 --> 20:40.355
Hey, Bubby.

20:40.357 --> 20:41.490
I brought you some chicken soup

20:41.492 --> 20:43.242
for taking care of me
the last couple days.

20:43.244 --> 20:45.327
I enjoyed being your Bubby.

20:45.329 --> 20:47.963
I guess you were wrong, Max.
You and I do have family--

20:47.965 --> 20:49.030
each other.

20:49.032 --> 20:50.365
We're not family until we have

20:50.367 --> 20:53.585
to testify against each other
in a manslaughter trial.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.205
Here, eat this.

20:57.207 --> 20:58.807
I don't want you to
catch what I just had.

20:58.809 --> 20:59.975
Not gonna happen, Max.

20:59.977 --> 21:01.042
I took your advice.

21:01.044 --> 21:02.043
I manned up.

21:02.045 --> 21:03.645
I stared germs in the face.

21:03.647 --> 21:06.432
That's right, when you got sick,
I got balls.

21:06.434 --> 21:07.599
Booyah!

21:09.652 --> 21:12.855
Like looking in a mirror.
