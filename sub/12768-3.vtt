♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:09.625 --> 00:11.583
(indistinct conversations)

00:11.625 --> 00:14.041
(emergency radio chatter)

00:14.083 --> 00:16.917
OKAY, PEOPLE.
IT'S NOT A BEACH PARTY.

00:16.959 --> 00:18.291
LET'S GO NOW.

00:18.333 --> 00:20.333
YOU HAVE
FULL HOSPITAL PRIVILEGES.

00:20.375 --> 00:21.959
TRANSPLANT TEAM'S
STANDING BY.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.333
SARAH'S SISTER'S INSIDE.
HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE?

00:24.375 --> 00:26.959
SHE'LL GO INTO FULL
RENAL FAILURE WITHIN 72 HOURS

00:27.000 --> 00:28.333
WITHOUT THE SISTER'S KIDNEY.

00:28.375 --> 00:31.333
IT'S NOT A PERFECT MATCH,
BUT THE NEXT BEST THING.

00:31.375 --> 00:33.333
D--OH, HI.
HI. COME ON.

00:33.375 --> 00:35.959
OH, I DON'T GET MY KIDNEY
UNTIL I DISH?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.333
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:37.375 --> 00:39.333
UH, SEATTLE GRACE
IS MERGING WITH MERCY WEST,

00:39.375 --> 00:42.333
WHICH MEANS HALF THE DOCTORS
IN THE CITY ARE OUT OF A JOB.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.333
I'M GETTING A DIVORCE,
WHICH MEANS I'M A SINGLE MOM.

00:45.375 --> 00:46.959
STEVENS HAS CANCER.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.333
MEREDITH AND DEREK GOT MARRIED
ON A POST-IT NOTE.

00:49.375 --> 00:52.333
AND GEORGE O'MALLEY IS DEAD,
BUT YOU KNEW THAT ALREADY.
(sighs)

00:52.375 --> 00:55.375
UM, I DON'T SLEEP MUCH ANYMORE
BECAUSE I LAY AWAKE AT NIGHT

00:55.417 --> 00:57.375
AND WONDER
WHERE ALL THE JOY IS.

00:57.417 --> 00:59.000
DURING THE DAY,

00:59.041 --> 01:02.000
I REALIZE THAT THE JOY
PACKED ITS BAGS AND LEFT.

01:02.041 --> 01:05.041
THE GLASSES OF THE WORLD
ARE HALF-EMPTY.
BUT... YOU'RE AN ATTENDING.

01:05.083 --> 01:07.041
I AM AN ATTENDING.
HOW ARE YOU?

01:07.083 --> 01:08.875
I--
DR. BAILEY.

01:08.917 --> 01:11.583
AH, THIS IS OUR CHIEF
OF STAFF, DR. CHARLOTTE KING.

01:11.625 --> 01:13.583
OH, I APPRECIATE
THE PROFESSIONAL COURTESY.

01:13.625 --> 01:16.041
I HEAR YOU HAVE A NICE
LITTLE HOSPITAL HERE.
WE'RE SMALL BUT EFFICIENT.

01:16.083 --> 01:18.583
YOU CAME TO THE BEST PLACE
TO GET THE JOB DONE...
MM.

01:18.625 --> 01:21.208
RIGHT THIS TIME.

01:21.250 --> 01:24.041
THE DONOR'S A SINGLE MOM
WITH THREE SMALL CHILDREN

01:24.083 --> 01:26.458
AND AN EX-HUSBAND
WHO LIKES TO HIT THINGS.

01:26.500 --> 01:29.625
JUMPING ON A PLANE
OUT OF STATE'S NOT AN OPTION.

01:29.667 --> 01:32.875
OTHERWISE, SEATTLE GRACE WOULD
HAVE BEEN THE OBVIOUS CHOICE,

01:32.917 --> 01:35.041
CUTTING-EDGE TEACHING HOSPITAL
AND ALL.

01:35.083 --> 01:37.625
HERE AT ST. AMBROSE, YOU'LL FIND
THE DOCTORS DON'T NEED TEACHING.

01:37.667 --> 01:39.625
THEY ALREADY KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.625
EXCUSE ME.

01:41.667 --> 01:44.041
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
SHE'S A LITTLE, UH...

01:44.083 --> 01:47.250
I DON'T HAVE TO LIKE HER.
I JUST NEED HER O.R.

01:47.291 --> 01:50.417
DR. BAILEY. WELL, WELL, WELL.
LOOK AT YOU.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.417
WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT ME?

01:52.458 --> 01:56.041
NO, I JUST MEANT THAT...
I DIDN'T MEAN...

01:56.083 --> 01:57.458
HELLO.

01:57.500 --> 02:00.250
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?
WHERE'S MY KIDNEY?

02:00.291 --> 02:02.291
(clears throat)

02:02.333 --> 02:09.959
BAILEY'S HERE.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.917
(Addison) SAM'S AGREED TO BE
INTERNIST TO BOTH SISTERS.

02:12.959 --> 02:15.333
EMILY, THIS IS DR. BAILEY.
SHE'LL BE PERFORMING

02:15.375 --> 02:17.542
THE TRANSPLANT.
I'M READY.

02:17.583 --> 02:19.375
OKAY, WELL, FIRST
WE'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH

02:19.417 --> 02:21.375
THE PRE-SURGERY PROTOCOL.
YOU ALREADY HAVE MY FILE.

02:21.417 --> 02:24.750
I WAS TESTED AS A PARTIAL MATCH
THREE YEARS AGO.

02:24.792 --> 02:27.041
SARAH NEEDS MY KIDNEY NOW.
YOUR SISTER'S STABILIZED.

02:27.083 --> 02:30.125
IF WE DO THIS TOMORROW,
WE SHOULD BE FINE.
SARAH FOUGHT TO STAY ALIVE
FOR THREE EXCRUCIATING YEARS

02:30.166 --> 02:32.667
WHILE YOU WAITED
TO FIND A MATCH.

02:32.709 --> 02:35.291
NOW SOMEBODY SCREWED UP,
AND SHE'S DYING.

02:35.333 --> 02:38.041
SHE'S DONE WAITING.
I'M DONE WAITING.
SARAH'S GONE THROUGH
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

02:38.083 --> 02:40.041
OF PHYSICAL TRAUMA
IN THE LAST 24 HOURS.

02:40.083 --> 02:41.959
SHE JUST GOT OFF
AN AIR AMBULANCE.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.959
HER SYSTEM WAS FRAGILE
EVEN BEFORE SHE HAD

02:44.000 --> 02:45.709
THE FAILED ORGAN TRANSPLANT.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.333
NOW, HEY, I'M THE FIRST
TO ADMIT, WE MADE MISTAKES.

02:48.375 --> 02:50.959
BUT WE WILL NOT RUSH HER
INTO ANOTHER SURGERY

02:51.000 --> 02:53.625
BEFORE WE'VE GOT A WHOLE SLEW
OF TESTS TELLING US

02:53.667 --> 02:55.625
THAT SHE'S STRONG ENOUGH
TO HANDLE IT.

02:55.667 --> 02:59.041
WE DO THIS RIGHT,
OR WE DON'T DO IT AT ALL.

02:59.083 --> 03:01.041
YES, I'M... I'M SORRY.

03:01.083 --> 03:04.000
IT'S JUST...
IT'S MY SISTER.

03:06.083 --> 03:09.667
WELL, I'M GOING TO FIX THIS.

03:12.083 --> 03:14.875
(footsteps approach)

03:14.917 --> 03:16.583
WELCOME BACK.

03:16.625 --> 03:19.792
OH, THANK YOU, SHELDON.
(chuckles)

03:19.834 --> 03:21.250
(laughs)

03:21.291 --> 03:24.125
HOW ARE YA?
NO, NO, NOT THERAPEUTICALLY.

03:24.166 --> 03:25.750
I MEAN JUST AS FRIENDS.

03:25.792 --> 03:27.750
YOU KNOW, WHEN SOMEONE
COMES BACK TO WORK,

03:27.792 --> 03:30.125
IT'S A FRIENDLY QUESTION,
YOU KNOW, SO...

03:30.166 --> 03:32.375
WELL, LETTING THAT GO.
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

03:32.417 --> 03:34.667
HOW'S THE BABY?
YOU FOUND A GOOD NANNY?

03:36.166 --> 03:38.875
I GAVE HIM TO PETE.
WHAT?

03:38.917 --> 03:42.041
I GAVE THE BABY TO PETE.
TO BABYSIT? TO--TO VISIT?
TO--TO WHAT?

03:42.083 --> 03:44.083
TO LIVE. TO BE.

03:44.125 --> 03:46.166
TO... I...

03:46.208 --> 03:49.041
GAVE HIM TO PETE.
LUCAS COULD BE MY SON.

03:49.083 --> 03:52.041
I KNOW.
HE IS YOUR SON,
AND YOU GAVE HIM TO PETE?

03:52.083 --> 03:55.041
YOU GAVE HIM TO PETE?
IT WAS... (sighs)
FOR THE BEST.

03:55.083 --> 03:56.917
IT'S FOR THE BEST?
I-I HAVE NO WORDS.

03:56.959 --> 03:59.041
THERE ARE NO WORDS.
WORDS ARE NOT ENOUGH!

03:59.083 --> 04:02.041
SHELDON, SHELDON,
THIS IS MY FIRST DAY BACK.

04:02.083 --> 04:04.291
I AM...
DOING THE BEST I CAN.

04:04.333 --> 04:07.667
COULD YOU JUST GO?

04:07.709 --> 04:09.500
CAN YOU GO?

04:09.542 --> 04:11.667
WELL, I--
CAN YOU JUST--

04:11.709 --> 04:15.208
'CAUSE IT WOULD REALLY HELP
IF YOU WOULD JUST...

04:21.166 --> 04:23.125
LUKE IS LIVING WITH YOU?

04:23.166 --> 04:25.333
SHH.
LUCAS IS TRYING TO SLEEP.

04:25.375 --> 04:27.041
SO...

04:27.083 --> 04:29.500
SO VIOLET JUST
GAVE HIM TO YOU?

04:29.542 --> 04:31.625
WHAT'S GOING ON, PETE,
WITH VIOLET?

04:31.667 --> 04:33.875
SHE'S WORKING ON THINGS.

04:33.917 --> 04:38.083
DON'T WORRY, SHELDON.
LUCAS IS FINE.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.083
OKAY. EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD.

04:45.125 --> 04:48.125
NOW WE'RE GONNA LET TERESA
TAKE A BLOOD SAMPLE FROM YOU.

04:48.166 --> 04:51.458
UH, MY BLOOD TYPE IS A-B,
I'M R-H POSITIVE,

04:51.500 --> 04:53.041
AND I'M A SCORPIO.

04:53.083 --> 04:55.709
WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED
TO KNOW?
PROBABLY NOTHING.

04:55.750 --> 04:58.542
BUT WHY DON'T YOU LET US
DO OUR JOB

04:58.583 --> 05:01.667
SO DR. BAILEY CAN DO HERS?
IS SHE GOOD--DR. BAILEY?

05:01.709 --> 05:04.667
BECAUSE AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
IN SEATTLE--
DR. BAILEY
IS ONE OF THE BEST.

05:04.709 --> 05:07.458
SHE SEEMS
A LITTLE, UM... COLD.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.875
(laughs)
SHE'S A SURGEON.

05:09.917 --> 05:13.458
UH, YOU WANT HER TO BE QUICK,
DECISIVE, AND SHE'S BOTH.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.041
SHE'S GOOD. YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.166
I HAVE THREE KIDS
TO WORRY ABOUT.

05:18.208 --> 05:22.291
UH, SARAH SAVED US...
ALL OF US.

05:22.333 --> 05:25.291
I MARRIED A BAD GUY,
AND I COULDN'T GET OUT.

05:25.333 --> 05:28.000
I JUST... WATCHED MY LIFE

05:28.041 --> 05:30.166
TURN INTO
THIS TERRIBLE PLACE.

05:30.208 --> 05:32.625
THEN SARAH FLEW IN.

05:32.667 --> 05:36.041
SHE TOOK CARE OF THE KIDS,
STAYED WITH US FOR SIX MONTHS

05:36.083 --> 05:38.041
AND MADE SURE
WE WERE ALL SAFE.

05:38.083 --> 05:41.041
MY BABIES DON'T HAVE A DAD.
THEY DON'T HAVE GRANDPARENTS.

05:41.083 --> 05:44.041
THEY HAVE ME
AND THEY HAVE SARAH.

05:44.083 --> 05:46.041
(voice breaks) WE NEED HER.

05:46.083 --> 05:50.083
YOU'RE GIVING UP AN ORGAN.
WE DON'T TAKE THAT LIGHTLY.

05:50.125 --> 05:51.750
OKAY.

05:54.875 --> 05:56.542
OH, HEY.

05:56.583 --> 05:58.834
YOU'RE GOOD WITH HER.

05:58.875 --> 06:00.834
THANKS.
HOW'S THE SISTER?

06:00.875 --> 06:03.041
OH, SHE'S STABLE FOR NOW.

06:03.083 --> 06:05.041
AND YOU'RE COMFORTABLE
WITH THIS MATCH?

06:05.083 --> 06:07.166
IT WASN'T A GOOD MATCH
THREE YEARS AGO,

06:07.208 --> 06:09.792
BUT WITH ALL THE PROGRESS
IN ANTI-REJECTION DRUGS,

06:09.834 --> 06:11.333
WE'LL MAKE IT WORK.

06:11.375 --> 06:13.333
HEY, IT'S ALL WE GOT.

06:13.375 --> 06:14.583
OKAY.

06:14.625 --> 06:16.959
HOW ARE THOSE
ANXIETY ATTACKS?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
ASTHMA.
RIGHT.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.709
IT WAS ASTHMA.

06:26.667 --> 06:29.041
RYAN'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

06:29.083 --> 06:31.041
I KEEP TELLING HIM
THAT IT TAKES TIME

06:31.083 --> 06:33.667
TO BUILD A NEW IMMUNE SYSTEM
FROM SCRATCH, BUT--

06:33.709 --> 06:36.667
BUT HE'S 16, AND HE'S LIVING
IN SUBURBAN JAIL.

06:36.709 --> 06:39.166
NOT THAT
IT'S NOT BEAUTIFUL.

06:39.208 --> 06:42.041
(air hisses)

06:42.083 --> 06:44.000
(hiss)

06:44.041 --> 06:46.166
MY MAN.

06:46.208 --> 06:48.583
Do you know how many things
you can't do

06:48.625 --> 06:50.583
while your mother
is watching every second?

06:50.625 --> 06:52.250
(Cooper) Yeah, 2,563.

06:52.291 --> 06:55.250
Two years, Coop.
Almost two years in a bubble.

06:55.291 --> 06:57.417
Yeah, with digital cable

06:57.458 --> 07:00.291
AND Wi-Fi, DVR, DVD.

07:00.333 --> 07:03.625
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT WOULD CALL THAT HEAVEN.

07:03.667 --> 07:06.667
YOU WANT ME TO GROW UP
TO BE A EUNUCH?

07:06.709 --> 07:09.750
SPILL IT. (clears throat)
HOMECOMING, TOMORROW.

07:09.792 --> 07:14.041
KELLI'S GOING, I'M NOT,
AND FRANCIS STOKES IS.
SHE'D KISS A GUY
NAMED FRANCIS?

07:14.083 --> 07:16.250
OKAY, LOOK, YOU'RE GONNA
GET OUTTA HERE.

07:16.291 --> 07:18.250
IT'S NOT LIKE THE OLD DAYS,
WHEN BEING BORN

07:18.291 --> 07:20.333
WITHOUT AN IMMUNE SYSTEM
MEANT YOU HAVE TO STAY

07:20.375 --> 07:22.083
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS FOREVER.

07:22.125 --> 07:23.917
YOU ARE GETTING BETTER,

07:23.959 --> 07:26.041
BUT WE GOTTA BE
REALLY CAREFUL WITH SCIDS.

07:26.083 --> 07:29.417
AND, YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT THIS
KISSING STUFF FEELS IMPORTANT--
COOP, I KNOW 16
WAS A LONG TIME AGO,

07:29.458 --> 07:31.834
BUT YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.
YOU HAVE SEX.

07:31.875 --> 07:34.542
I HAVE TALK AND TALK.

07:34.583 --> 07:38.041
AND TALK IS STARTING TO GET
REALLY... OLD,

07:38.083 --> 07:39.750
LIKE YOU.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.792
THAT'S FUNNY. YOU KNOW, TALK CAN
ACTUALLY BE HARD TO COME BY.

07:42.834 --> 07:45.291
I THINK MY GIRLFRIEND COULD
TAKE SOME LESSONS FROM YOURS.

07:45.333 --> 07:48.041
(computer chirps)
Ry.

07:48.083 --> 07:50.542
Hey, Ry.
How's the bubble boy?

07:50.583 --> 07:53.000
SHE WON'T BE
MY GIRLFRIEND FOR LONG.

07:53.041 --> 07:56.125
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING MORE
YOU CAN DO TO GET ME OUTTA HERE?

07:56.166 --> 07:58.959
(Miranda)
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A SPA.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.959
WHEN WILL THE WAITER COME BY
WITH CHAMPAGNE?
(laughs)

08:02.000 --> 08:04.959
ADDISON... UH, DR. BAILEY.
HOW ARE YOU?
NAOMI. RIGHT.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.375
UH, I THOUGHT
YOU LEFT THE PRACTICE.
UH, I DID.

08:08.417 --> 08:12.083
NAOMI WENT DOWNSTAIRS
TO RUN A DIFFERENT PRACTICE.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.625
I, UH, I TRIED
TO CALL YOU, TWICE.

08:14.667 --> 08:18.291
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
I'VE JUST BEEN CRAZY BUSY.

08:18.333 --> 08:22.041
I JUST CAME UP TO,
YOU KNOW, WELCOME VIOLET BACK.

08:22.083 --> 08:23.542
(elevator bell dings)

08:23.583 --> 08:25.542
THOUGHT THE TWO OF YOU
WERE BEST FRIENDS.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.542
WE WERE. WE ARE.
UH, I JUST...

08:27.583 --> 08:31.041
OH, COOPER, COOPER, UH,
THIS IS, UH, DR. BAILEY,

08:31.083 --> 08:33.041
MY FRIEND FROM SEATTLE.
OH, HEY, WOW. WOW.

08:33.083 --> 08:35.041
YOU'RE SHORTER THAN--
THAN I THOUGHT.

08:35.083 --> 08:37.500
I MEAN, GIVEN WHAT SAM SAYS,
AND ADDISON, ABOUT...

08:37.542 --> 08:40.083
THAT'S--IT'S A COMPLIMENT.
UM...

08:40.125 --> 08:42.083
I HAVE TWINS WAITING.

08:42.125 --> 08:44.125
HOPE HE'S BETTER WITH KIDS
THAN ADULTS.

08:44.166 --> 08:45.834
MM.
(chuckles)

08:45.875 --> 08:47.875
OH, VIOLET.

08:47.917 --> 08:49.583
OUR THERAPIST. DR. BAILEY.

08:49.625 --> 08:51.959
OH, HI.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.792
WELL, I...

08:55.250 --> 08:58.166
WAIT. SO IS SHE THE ONE
YOU SAID HAD THE BABY

08:58.208 --> 08:59.792
AND THEN...
YEAH.

08:59.834 --> 09:01.792
(gasps) SHE'S BACK AT WORK?
MM-HMM.

09:01.834 --> 09:03.792
OH, IF THAT
HAD HAPPENED TO ME,

09:03.834 --> 09:05.792
I'D BE SPENDING MY TIME
IN A PADDED ROOM.

09:05.834 --> 09:07.417
OH, IS THAT THE FATHER?

09:07.458 --> 09:10.208
YEAH. WELL, ONE OF 'EM.
T-THERE'S ANOTHER ONE?

09:10.250 --> 09:13.208
IT'S COMPLICATED.
(laughs) THIS PLACE
IS BETTER THAN A TELENOVELA.

09:13.250 --> 09:16.083
IT'S NOT A TELENOVELA.
(laughs)

09:18.125 --> 09:20.041
ADDISON?
DR. MONTGOMERY.

09:20.083 --> 09:22.083
MORGAN.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

09:22.125 --> 09:25.667
WHAT'S--WHAT'S WRONG?
DID YOU DO IT?
DID YOU SLEEP WITH MY HUSBAND?

09:25.709 --> 09:27.208
UH, AHEM.

09:27.250 --> 09:29.834
MORGAN, LET'S, UH--
UH, I K--HE SAYS YOU DIDN'T.

09:29.875 --> 09:32.041
AND I-I JUST WANT TO BELIEVE
YOU DIDN'T,

09:32.083 --> 09:34.667
YOU BEING MY DOCTOR AND ALL,

09:34.709 --> 09:37.000
BUT THEN I FOUND MYSELF
OUTSIDE YOUR BUILDING.

09:37.041 --> 09:40.000
AND I KNEW IF I DIDN'T
ASK YOU... TELL ME.
MORGAN, NO.

09:40.041 --> 09:42.625
I PROMISE YOU, NOTHING LIKE
THAT EVER HAPPENED.

09:42.667 --> 09:45.458
HE'S TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

09:45.500 --> 09:48.250
I-I-I BELIEVE YOU.

09:48.291 --> 09:49.917
I'M SORRY.

09:49.959 --> 09:53.041
I HAVE TO GO.

09:55.083 --> 09:58.041
GO AHEAD.
GET IT OFF YOUR CHEST.
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.

09:58.083 --> 10:00.667
HE WAS A HEART SURGEON.
SHE WAS MY PATIENT.

10:00.709 --> 10:02.542
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

10:02.583 --> 10:04.542
THERE WAS NO SEX AT ALL.
NOTHING.

10:04.583 --> 10:07.458
OKAY, WELL, WE--WE--
WE WENT TO FIRST BASE.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.041
MAYBE SECOND.

10:09.083 --> 10:11.542
SE--SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
FIRST AND SECOND BASE--

10:11.583 --> 10:14.041
I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT YOUR BASES OR YOUR BALLS.

10:14.083 --> 10:18.458
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.
MIRANDA, IT'S YOU. IT'S ME.
I KNOW YOU.

10:18.500 --> 10:21.333
I KNOW YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY.

10:21.375 --> 10:23.542
(knock on door)
EXCUSE ME.
WE GOT EMILY'S TESTS BACK.

10:23.583 --> 10:25.500
OH, GOOD.
BAD.

10:25.542 --> 10:29.709
WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?
EMILY CAN'T DONATE HER KIDNEY.

10:29.750 --> 10:31.083
(knock on door)

10:31.125 --> 10:35.750
EXCUSE ME. EMILY, COULD I
SPEAK WITH YOU FOR A MOMENT?

10:35.792 --> 10:37.875
TOLD YOU THEY'D FIND OUT.

10:37.917 --> 10:40.041
WAIT. SO YOU'RE AWARE OF--
OF EMILY'S STATUS?

10:40.083 --> 10:42.458
SHE'S MY SISTER. SHE KNOWS
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME.

10:42.500 --> 10:46.083
SO IT WAS ONLY YOUR DOCTORS YOU
WERE KEEPING THE SECRET FROM--

10:46.125 --> 10:48.083
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
H.I.V. POSITIVE?

10:48.125 --> 10:50.500
DOESN'T MATTER.
THE TRANSPLANT NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

10:50.542 --> 10:54.041
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF,
DR. BAILEY. I'M OUT OF TIME.

10:54.083 --> 10:56.375
I'D RATHER GET A.I.D.S.
THAN DIE.

11:03.667 --> 11:05.625
I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY LIED.

11:05.667 --> 11:08.083
WELL, CAN YOU BLAME 'EM?

11:08.125 --> 11:10.083
CAN YOU PUT SARAH
BACK ON DIALYSIS?

11:10.125 --> 11:12.709
NO, NO. WE'RE AT THE END
OF THE LINE.

11:12.750 --> 11:14.709
I CALLED
THE NATIONAL KIDNEY REGISTRY,

11:14.750 --> 11:17.709
BUT, YOU KNOW, SHE'S BEEN
WAITING THREE YEARS FOR A MATCH.

11:17.750 --> 11:20.083
THEY DON'T HAVE ONE.
WHAT ABOUT A CADAVER DONOR?

11:20.125 --> 11:22.291
NO MATCH. NOTHING CLOSE.

11:22.333 --> 11:25.834
WE JUST HOPE SOMEONE DIES
BETWEEN NOW AND THE MORNING

11:25.875 --> 11:27.709
OR WE...

11:27.750 --> 11:30.750
GIVE SARAH EMILY'S KIDNEY.

11:30.792 --> 11:32.959
(chuckles) YEAH.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.125
YOU CAN'T TRANSPLANT
AN H.I.V.-INFECTED ORGAN.

11:37.166 --> 11:39.125
IF YOU PUT H.I.V.
INTO HER BODY

11:39.166 --> 11:41.125
AND THEN BOMBARD
HER IMMUNE SYSTEM

11:41.166 --> 11:42.750
WITH ANTI-REJECTION DRUGS,

11:42.792 --> 11:45.041
SHE'S NOT JUST LOOKING
AT LIVING WITH H.I.V.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.041
SHE COULD DEVELOP
FULL-BLOWN A.I.D.S.

11:47.083 --> 11:49.041
BEFORE SHE EVEN LEAVES
THE HOSPITAL.

11:49.083 --> 11:52.041
SHE COULD. OR SHE COULD
LIVE WITH H.I.V.

11:52.083 --> 11:54.041
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE
AND BE FINE.

11:54.083 --> 11:56.041
WHAT ABOUT EMILY?
SHE'S ALREADY BEEN COMPROMISED.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.041
I MEAN, IS THERE DATA
THAT TELLS US

11:58.083 --> 12:00.625
WHAT LOSING A KIDNEY DOES
TO SOMEONE WITH H.I.V.?

12:00.667 --> 12:03.041
WHAT PART OF "THERE IS NO TIME"
DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?

12:03.083 --> 12:05.166
WHAT PART OF "ILLEGAL"
DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?

12:05.208 --> 12:07.166
OH, THE LAWS WERE CREATED
YEARS AGO,

12:07.208 --> 12:09.792
BACK WHEN H.I.V.
WAS A DEATH SENTENCE.

12:09.834 --> 12:11.458
THEY'RE OUTDATED.
OUT--

12:11.500 --> 12:14.041
IT'S NOT RELEVANT. A.I.D.S.
IS TREATABLE NOW, OKAY?

12:14.083 --> 12:17.041
DEATH ISN'T.
YOU ARE PLAYING GOD.

12:17.083 --> 12:21.417
I'M A SURGEON.
IT'S HOW WE PASS THE TIME.
DR. BAILEY, WE BOTH WANT
TO SAVE YOUR PATIENT.

12:21.458 --> 12:24.041
BUT YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME
TO BACK YOU ON THIS.

12:24.083 --> 12:27.000
I'M PUTTING MY FOOT DOWN. OKAY?
MY--MY--MY FOOT IS DOWN.

12:27.041 --> 12:29.792
YOUR FOOT IS DOWN?
YOUR FOOT IS DOWN?

12:29.834 --> 12:32.166
OH, OH, NO. YOU BETTER
PICK THAT FOOT UP

12:32.208 --> 12:34.500
AND USE IT
TO WALK AWAY FROM ME.

12:36.208 --> 12:38.291
(Cooper) YOU'RE
THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE GUY.

12:38.333 --> 12:41.041
YOU GOTTA HELP ME OUT HERE.
THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.041
HE'S NOT READY YET.
IT'S ONE DANCE.

12:43.083 --> 12:46.041
AND THEN HIS GIRL'S GONNA
BE THERE WITH SOME OTHER GUY.

12:46.083 --> 12:48.834
LISA BAXTER--SHE WAS
MY LAB PARTNER IN CHEM,

12:48.875 --> 12:51.625
WHICH WAS GREAT,
BECAUSE NORMALLY A GUY LIKE ME

12:51.667 --> 12:54.041
WOULD NOT HAVE A CHANCE
WITH A GIRL LIKE LISA.

12:54.083 --> 12:56.625
BUT, YOU KNOW, I MADE HER LAUGH,
SO WE GOT TO TALK.

12:56.667 --> 12:58.625
AND SHE REALIZED
MY INHERENT CHARMS.

12:58.667 --> 13:01.667
ANYWAY... I GET UP THE NERVE
TO ASK HER TO WINTER FORMAL,

13:01.709 --> 13:04.500
AND SHE SAYS YES RIGHT BEFORE
MY PARENTS TELL ME

13:04.542 --> 13:07.500
THAT WE'RE GOING TO DES MOINES
TO MY COUSIN IRA'S BAR MITZVAH.
MY HEART'S BREAKING, COOP.

13:07.542 --> 13:10.041
OKAY, WELL, THAT WAS IT.
BY THE TIME I GOT BACK,

13:10.083 --> 13:12.166
SHE WAS DATING THIS BEEFY GUY
NAMED TED,

13:12.208 --> 13:14.917
AND I NEVER GOT MY SHOT.
ARE WE DOING THIS
FOR YOU OR FOR HIM?

13:14.959 --> 13:17.125
OH, DON'T GROW UP ON ME NOW,
PETE. HIS COUNT'S BORDERLINE.

13:17.166 --> 13:20.083
YOU BOOST PEOPLE ALL THE TIME.
YOU KNOW IT COULD HELP.

13:20.125 --> 13:22.083
AND IF HIS NUMBERS
ARE NORMAL...

13:22.125 --> 13:24.125
COME ON. LET'S LET THE KID
GET THE GIRL.

13:32.083 --> 13:33.083
VIOLET.

13:37.792 --> 13:39.959
(sighs)

13:40.000 --> 13:41.959
I AM UNIMAGINABLY SORRY

13:42.000 --> 13:44.542
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU, VIOLET.

13:44.583 --> 13:47.542
AND I'M SORRY YOU AND PETE
AREN'T WORKING OUT,

13:47.583 --> 13:51.000
BUT... YOU GAVE AWAY A CHILD
THAT WASN'T YOURS TO GIVE.

13:51.041 --> 13:53.583
I MEAN, I-IT COULD BE,
BUT--BUT WE DON'T KNOW.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.083
AND I NEED TO KNOW.

13:55.125 --> 13:58.125
I NEED TO KNOW, VIOLET,
IF HE'S MY SON.

14:02.333 --> 14:05.291
I WANT YOU TO AGREE
TO A PATERNITY TEST.

14:05.333 --> 14:07.125
OKAY.

14:07.166 --> 14:09.083
WHAT?

14:09.125 --> 14:10.709
FINE.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.375
WHATEVER. DO IT.

14:19.709 --> 14:21.667
SO WHAT DO WE THINK,

14:21.709 --> 14:23.333
CORSAGE OR NO CORSAGE?

14:23.375 --> 14:25.041
(Cooper and Pete) NO CORSAGE.

14:25.083 --> 14:27.166
I KINDA LIKE THE IDEA
OF PINNING IT ON. YOU KNOW...

14:27.208 --> 14:29.792
YEAH, WE KNOW...
(chuckles) ROMEO.

14:29.834 --> 14:32.125
AND I'M DONE.
I'M GONNA BE GOOD?

14:32.166 --> 14:35.166
WELL, WE'LL SEE. YOUR C-D-4
HAS TO BE ABOVE 200.

14:35.208 --> 14:39.041
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK,
KISS HER WHILE WE'RE DANCING

14:39.083 --> 14:41.250
OR WAIT
AND TAKE HER OUTSIDE AFTER?

14:43.166 --> 14:44.959
WHAT?

14:45.000 --> 14:48.041
LOOK, I... I WANT HIM
TO BE HAPPY.

14:48.083 --> 14:50.333
HE'S KEPT
SUCH A GOOD ATTITUDE.

14:50.375 --> 14:53.000
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
EASIER THIS TIME

14:53.041 --> 14:55.041
BECAUSE I'D BEEN THROUGH IT.

14:55.083 --> 14:57.375
THAT WAS STUPID.

14:57.417 --> 15:01.000
THE IDEA OF LOSING YOUR CHILD
DOESN'T GET EASIER.

15:04.834 --> 15:07.041
YOU HAVE KIDS?

15:07.083 --> 15:08.041
YES.

15:08.083 --> 15:10.041
THEN YOU KNOW...

15:10.083 --> 15:12.250
THAT FEELING.

15:14.834 --> 15:17.375
SHE'S GETTING WORSE.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.375
WE'VE CONTACTED
EVERY DONOR LIST.

15:19.417 --> 15:21.375
HOPEFULLY WE'LL FIND
ANOTHER MATCH.

15:21.417 --> 15:23.000
AND WHEN THEY DON'T?

15:23.041 --> 15:24.375
LET'S CROSS THAT BRIDGE...

15:24.417 --> 15:26.417
(sighs)

15:26.458 --> 15:30.208
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

15:30.250 --> 15:33.041
ARE YOU OKAY?

15:33.083 --> 15:35.458
I'VE SPENT
THE PAST 12 HOURS

15:35.500 --> 15:37.750
THINKING ABOUT DEATH.

15:37.792 --> 15:39.750
SARAH DYING TOMORROW,

15:39.792 --> 15:42.041
EMILY'S H.I.V.
TURNING INTO A.I.D.S.

15:42.083 --> 15:43.667
AND HER DYING

15:43.709 --> 15:45.667
AND LEAVING HER THREE BABIES
WITH NO ONE,

15:45.709 --> 15:47.750
SOMEONE DYING
SO I CAN HAVE A KIDNEY.

15:47.792 --> 15:49.750
I'VE BEEN SITTING IN THE E.R.

15:49.792 --> 15:54.542
JUST HOPING SOME 24 YEAR OLD
ON A MOTORCYCLE WITH NO HELMET

15:54.583 --> 15:56.542
BITES IT ON THE FREEWAY

15:56.583 --> 15:59.250
AND BY SOME MIRACLE
IS A MATCH.

15:59.291 --> 16:02.375
I'M SICK
OF THINKING ABOUT DEATH.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.667
(knocks on doorjamb)
I WANT A PATERNITY TEST.

16:13.709 --> 16:15.667
HAVE YOU TALKED TO VIOLET?

16:15.709 --> 16:18.041
I HAVE HER CONSENT, YEAH.
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT PETE?

16:18.083 --> 16:20.542
WHAT ABOUT ME WHAT?

16:20.583 --> 16:24.041
I WANT ADDISON TO PERFORM
A PATERNITY TEST ON LUCAS.
NO.

16:24.083 --> 16:27.000
HOW SOON CAN YOU DO THIS?
I SAID NO.

16:27.041 --> 16:30.041
UH, GUYS, GUYS, LET'S JUST
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
IF I TAKE ANY MORE BREATHS,
I'M GONNA HYPERVENTILATE.

16:30.083 --> 16:32.500
JUST DO THE TEST.
ADDISON, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
YOU DON'T HAVE--

16:32.542 --> 16:35.041
THEN I'LL GET SOMEONE ELSE.
I WANT TO KNOW.

16:35.083 --> 16:38.041
WELL, I KNOW. I LOOK AT HIM
AND I ALREADY KNOW.
YOU WANT ME
TO DIAGNOSE THAT, PETE?

16:38.083 --> 16:40.417
IT'S DENIAL.
YOU ASKED ME
TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.834
(Addison) OKAY, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING.

16:42.875 --> 16:46.041
WHEN SHE WAS WITH YOU. I DIDN'T
SAY YOU COULD RAISE MY CHILD.
HE'S NOT YOUR CHILD!

16:46.083 --> 16:47.917
I WILL GET A LAWYER
IF I HAVE TO.

16:47.959 --> 16:49.709
I HAVE THE MOTHER'S CONSENT.
(Pete) DON'T DO IT.

16:49.750 --> 16:52.625
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, GUYS.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO--
DO THE TEST.

16:52.667 --> 16:55.625
SHELDON, PLEASE.
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THIS FAR.

16:55.667 --> 16:57.667
(exhales deeply)
I HATE THIS DAY.

17:01.083 --> 17:02.917
(Tal &amp; Acacia's "Drifting Away"
playing)

17:02.959 --> 17:04.917
I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR PATIENT.

17:04.959 --> 17:08.625
I FIGURED I'D POUR YOU
A GLASS MORE THAN HALF-FULL.

17:08.667 --> 17:11.542
WHEN DID YOU BECOME
AN OPTIMIST?

17:11.583 --> 17:15.542
I'M NOT. I JUST SAW
THAT YOU WERE BROODING.

17:15.583 --> 17:18.041
OH. NOT BROODING.

17:18.083 --> 17:20.625
JUST CHECKING OUT
THE LOCAL SCENERY.

17:20.667 --> 17:24.041
AM NOT.
I DO NOT CHECK OUT SCENERY.

17:24.083 --> 17:26.583
I THINK IT'S GREAT.
YOU'RE SINGLE. HE'S SINGLE.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.583
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
THERE WERE SPARKS.

17:28.625 --> 17:30.333
JUST TELL ME SOMETHING.

17:30.375 --> 17:33.625
JUST TELL ME HOW COME
ALL ANYBODY THINKS ABOUT IS SEX?

17:33.667 --> 17:35.625
WHY IS THAT
ALL YOU DOCTORS DO,

17:35.667 --> 17:38.333
SLEEP WITH EACH OTHER?
I DID NOT SLEEP WITH NOAH.

17:38.375 --> 17:41.375
(scoffs)
OKAY, LOOK, MAYBE I THOUGHT
ABOUT SLEEPING WITH HIM,

17:41.417 --> 17:43.834
BUT I DIDN'T DO IT. I DID
THE RIGHT THING THIS TIME.

17:43.875 --> 17:46.834
I DID NOT SLEEP WITH HIM. I
TRIED TO FIRE HER AS A PATIENT.

17:46.875 --> 17:49.041
I STOPPED THINGS WITH NOAH
BEFORE THEY WENT TOO FAR.

17:49.083 --> 17:51.041
FOR THE RECORD,
IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING.

17:51.083 --> 17:53.792
I WASN'T.
OKAY, YOU KNOW, YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING ME A FAVOR

17:53.834 --> 17:56.792
BY NOT SAYING ANYTHING, BUT IT'S
WRITTEN ALL OVER YOUR FACE.

17:56.834 --> 18:01.291
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST SAY IT
BEFORE YOUR HEAD EXPLODES.
HUSBAND'S BEST FRIEND,
PATIENT'S HUSBAND--

18:01.333 --> 18:03.625
