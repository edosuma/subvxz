WEBVTT

00:08.467 --> 00:10.219
<i>both alike in litness,</i>

00:10.302 --> 00:13.889
<i>in Fairfax,</i>
<i>where we lay our scene.</i>

00:13.973 --> 00:17.268
<i>From ancient beef break</i>
<i>to new drop mutiny,</i>

00:17.351 --> 00:20.396
<i>where clap-backs make</i>
<i>hype hands unclean.</i>

00:20.479 --> 00:24.316
<i>From forth the fatal flexes</i>
<i>of these two foes,</i>

00:24.400 --> 00:26.610
<i>one gang gang stands</i>

00:26.694 --> 00:28.821
<i>at the friendship crossroads.</i>

00:28.904 --> 00:32.032
<i>The which,</i>
<i>if you patient streamers watch,</i>

00:32.116 --> 00:36.328
<i>Latrine and Off-Brian's beef</i>
<i>shall squash.</i>

00:36.412 --> 00:38.622
Aka the block will never
be the same!

00:38.706 --> 00:41.792
The gang gang is donezo,
mothafuckas! Deadass!

00:41.876 --> 00:44.712
Shit is about to get crazy!

01:00.936 --> 01:03.105
So you say you want
to take down Latrine.

01:03.189 --> 01:04.482
Well, why should I listen

01:04.565 --> 01:06.484
to a 13-year-old
and his cracked tablet?

01:06.567 --> 01:09.278
She's my girlfriend,
and my Latrine-loving crew

01:09.361 --> 01:10.863
tried to murder her.

01:10.946 --> 01:12.782
<i>We're gonna squeeze 'em</i>
<i>like a grapefruit.</i>

01:12.865 --> 01:15.034
Mm, I fuckin' hate grapefruits.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.994
The worst of the citrii.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.996
- You guys want
some light in here?
- Terry!

01:19.079 --> 01:20.956
We would've turned the lights on

01:21.040 --> 01:23.334
if we wanted
the fucking lights on, Terry!

01:23.417 --> 01:26.420
- Yeah.
- All right, sorry,
Mrs. Moody-pants.

01:26.504 --> 01:28.839
Now, what did you have in mind?

01:28.923 --> 01:30.925
<i>You want to win</i>
<i>this fashion war,</i>

01:31.008 --> 01:32.927
<i>you start with the kids.</i>

01:33.010 --> 01:35.471
You get the kids...
you get Fairfax.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.185
- Eat shit, Benny!
- Uh, hey?

01:41.268 --> 01:43.187
You guys get the feeling
that everybody's

01:43.270 --> 01:44.688
talking shit about us?

01:44.772 --> 01:46.607
Everyone but Lily.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.442
She won't even look at me.

01:48.526 --> 01:50.194
It's like I traded in
my Scout sash

01:50.277 --> 01:51.654
for a scarlet letter.

01:51.737 --> 01:53.447
I've been texting Tru
all weekend.

01:53.531 --> 01:55.282
Homie won't even throw me
a read receipt.

01:55.366 --> 01:56.909
Nah, D, fuck all that.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.452
He should be texting us!

01:58.536 --> 02:00.162
If he wants to listen
to his A.I. girlfriend

02:00.246 --> 02:01.455
over his gang gang,

02:01.539 --> 02:03.123
then he's not the bruh
I thought he was.

02:03.207 --> 02:04.625
Have you guys seen him?

02:04.708 --> 02:06.460
'Cause he wasn't in Honors Lit.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.839
What's up, Fairfax Middle!

02:09.922 --> 02:12.258
Here at Off-Brian,
we continue the tradish

02:12.341 --> 02:14.134
of reading your fucking minds

02:14.218 --> 02:16.595
and changing the fucking game!

02:16.679 --> 02:19.014
Which is why
we're infusing some swag

02:19.098 --> 02:20.516
into this boring-ass school

02:20.599 --> 02:22.476
with Off-Brian uniforms!

02:24.812 --> 02:28.357
Or shall I say, "Truniforms"?

02:33.112 --> 02:35.155
No fucking way.

02:37.908 --> 02:41.620
Br-Br-Br-Br-Brian!

02:41.704 --> 02:44.248
You heard 'em, fam,
this school is

02:44.331 --> 02:47.543
officially an Off-Brian joint!

02:50.880 --> 02:52.923
Man, fuck
these bunk-ass Truniforms!

02:53.007 --> 02:55.342
Yeah, seriously,
who needs this many pockets

02:55.426 --> 02:57.845
- when you have a fanny?
- What'd I say, Kip?!

02:57.928 --> 03:00.764
You wear the red,
you wind up dead.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.183
- Carl, take him away.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.394
This shit ain't fashion,
it's fascism!

03:05.477 --> 03:06.729
This can't be right.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.355
The Truman we know
wouldn't do this.

03:08.439 --> 03:10.608
The Truman
you know is dead, Dale!

03:10.691 --> 03:12.651
He's taking Brian's side
to fuck with us.

03:12.735 --> 03:14.778
- D, my anarchy guru.
- Hit me.

03:14.862 --> 03:18.532
- It's time
to activate the hive!
<i>- Viva la revolución!</i>

03:18.616 --> 03:21.702
Left, left, left,

03:21.785 --> 03:23.495
right, left, left.

03:23.579 --> 03:25.539
Guys, guys! Over here!

03:25.623 --> 03:28.709
Last time I checked,
our mascot is the Hypebeasts!

03:28.792 --> 03:30.586
Flexing is in our blood!

03:30.669 --> 03:32.963
Why should we listen
to a bunch of murderers?!

03:33.047 --> 03:34.965
'Cause this is
how it starts, guys!

03:35.049 --> 03:36.800
Next thing you know,
we're singing

03:36.884 --> 03:38.469
the Pledge of Allegiance
to Brian

03:38.552 --> 03:40.638
before we take
our standardized Brian tests

03:40.721 --> 03:43.599
so we can get
into goddamn Brian college!

03:43.682 --> 03:44.975
Damn straight!

03:45.059 --> 03:46.936
Fairfax was founded on one name.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.395
Hiroki Hassan.

03:48.479 --> 03:50.856
And I plan
on dripping in Latrine

03:50.940 --> 03:53.359
until I drop.
Now who's with me?!

03:53.442 --> 03:55.069
- Me!

03:55.152 --> 03:56.362
There they are!

03:56.445 --> 03:57.529
It's the fuzz!

03:57.613 --> 03:58.822
Yeah!

04:04.453 --> 04:05.496
Aah!

04:05.579 --> 04:06.997
What the fuck?

04:11.001 --> 04:12.670
I got Dale!

04:12.753 --> 04:13.963
- Over here!

04:14.046 --> 04:16.215
Lily, how could you?

04:16.298 --> 04:18.550
Get off my boy, Spirit Chair!

04:18.634 --> 04:20.636
- Ow!
- Dale!

04:21.845 --> 04:24.139
This way!

04:24.223 --> 04:26.016
Oh, no, you don't.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.728
We're cornered!

04:29.812 --> 04:31.814
I got an idea.

04:40.823 --> 04:43.242
Whoa, the fuck is this place?

04:43.325 --> 04:44.785
Weston's <i>Parasite</i> room.

04:44.868 --> 04:46.620
For whenever he needs
to fake his own death.

04:46.704 --> 04:48.372
Or take a nap.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.874
Yo, this whole thing
stinks of Cerise.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.876
She is playing his ass.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.378
We got to show Truman

04:54.461 --> 04:55.963
what really happened
the night of the dance.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.965
How are we supposed
to do that, D?

04:58.048 --> 05:00.592
I don't know yet.
I need to access her memories.

05:00.676 --> 05:03.512
It's the only way to get
the gang gang back together.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.931
Look, I'm all
for taking down Cerise,

05:06.015 --> 05:08.058
but if I don't help
Hiroki win this war,

05:08.142 --> 05:11.103
pretty soon the whole block
is gonna be Off-Brian!

05:11.186 --> 05:12.896
So here's what I'm thinking.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.106
- What the...?
- First we unleash a bunch

05:14.189 --> 05:15.858
of mosquitos,
everybody getting bit.

05:17.693 --> 05:21.363
<i>"My dearest Dale, meet me</i>
<i>at the Fairfax Forever Cemetery.</i>

05:21.447 --> 05:23.490
<i>Midnight. I know it's past</i>

05:23.574 --> 05:25.367
<i>our bedtime,</i>
<i>but it's supes important.</i>

05:25.451 --> 05:27.536
<i>Don't tell anyone,</i>
<i>not even your dad.</i>

05:27.619 --> 05:30.039
<i>XOXO, Lily."</i>

05:30.122 --> 05:31.832
You're coming
with me, right, Dale?

05:34.084 --> 05:36.128
I'm totally with you.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.380
Maybe I can do
a little late-night recon.

05:38.464 --> 05:40.507
See what's poppin'
in the streets.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.342
A'ight, we got our game plan.

05:42.426 --> 05:44.136
Derica's gonna take down
the psycho Roomba.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.637
Fuck yeah, I am!

05:45.721 --> 05:47.473
- Dale's gonna do some recon.
- Dang straight.

05:47.556 --> 05:50.142
And I'm gonna help
Hiroki save his empire.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.518
Let's fucking go!

05:53.604 --> 05:55.522
Sire.

05:55.606 --> 05:57.316
There's a little fat boy here

05:57.399 --> 05:59.735
at the gate to see you.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.987
<i>- Hiroki, it's me! Let me in!</i>

06:02.071 --> 06:04.406
Hiroki, the school has been
taken by Off-Brian.

06:04.490 --> 06:06.075
Latrine's under attack.

06:06.158 --> 06:08.744
I know!
I'm doing the best I can.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.497
But Off-Brian's army is
growing by the drop.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.833
They've already taken
Don Pardo's and Cold Brewjeria.

06:14.917 --> 06:17.503
Use me, Hiroki,
let me help you or some shit!

06:17.586 --> 06:19.171
What do you have in mind,
Cool Ranch?

06:19.254 --> 06:21.465
I have a clap-back
that is gonna send Off-Brian

06:21.548 --> 06:23.759
and Truman packing to Payless.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.969
Tronté...

06:26.053 --> 06:29.139
pull up a mini throne
and a cape for the boy.

06:37.523 --> 06:39.608
Bingo!

06:46.698 --> 06:48.951
Psst! Lily!

06:49.034 --> 06:50.953
Dale? Oh, my God.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.913
I'm so sorry
that I ratted you out.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.165
I wanted to tell you,
but my dad's a lieutenant hench

06:55.249 --> 06:57.334
for Off-Brian, and I couldn't
let word get to him

06:57.417 --> 06:59.211
that I'm soft on Latrine.

06:59.294 --> 07:02.172
F your dad! There's a place
for you at Latrine.

07:02.256 --> 07:04.508
Come with me
and we can be together forever.

07:04.591 --> 07:07.803
Deny thy father,
and refuse Off-Brian?

07:07.886 --> 07:10.430
Yeah. Wait, why are you
talking like that?

07:10.514 --> 07:13.851
Sorry, we have this big
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> essay

07:13.934 --> 07:16.520
due on Tuesday,
so it's just been on my mind.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.730
- And prose is hot.
- I doth agree.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.357
Thou art hot AF.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.276
Then only one question remains.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.902
To French...

07:23.986 --> 07:26.864
or not to French?

07:26.947 --> 07:28.532
Oi!

07:28.615 --> 07:29.825
Who goes there and shit?

07:29.908 --> 07:31.201
Dale, hide!

07:31.285 --> 07:33.203
I'm with Off-Brian!

07:33.287 --> 07:36.331
Just, uh... doing
a little late-night tagging.

07:36.415 --> 07:39.209
Live free, Bri hard!

07:39.293 --> 07:41.211
O-Okay, sounds legit.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.842
It's too dangerous here.
I have to go.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.635
When will I see you again?

07:48.719 --> 07:50.971
I'll send word
via carrier pigeon.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.723
Take this to remember me by.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.100
I'll see you soon,
my fair Lillith.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.401
Hello there,
would you like to try

08:04.484 --> 08:06.278
a flight of jelly samplers?

08:06.361 --> 08:08.405
Have you seen
this Kangol-clad man?

08:08.488 --> 08:10.407
Jacquomo!

08:10.490 --> 08:12.534
There's someone here to see you!

08:21.585 --> 08:22.794
Wait, are you Chet?

08:22.878 --> 08:24.213
Chet is dead.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.423
I'm Jacquomo now.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.425
How the hell did you find me?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.093
I'm here to hunt a catfish.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.096
A really big catfish.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.599
Listen, I'm sorry,
I can't help you.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.227
My Big Juice days are behind me.

08:38.310 --> 08:40.604
I'm an artisanal
jelly-smith now.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.481
Cerise framed me for murder

08:42.564 --> 08:44.399
and she brainwashed
my friend Truman.

08:44.483 --> 08:46.526
Truman? He's in danger?

08:46.610 --> 08:47.986
Yes, jelly man!

08:48.070 --> 08:50.322
And I need you to help me
access her hard drive,

08:50.405 --> 08:52.908
so I can show Truman
how evil she really is.

08:52.991 --> 08:56.286
And save him from a life
of being A.I. arm candy.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.455
Oh my God, Uli, ready the tech!

08:58.538 --> 09:00.958
And bring me
a thousand apricots!

09:06.630 --> 09:09.883
<i>Br-Br-Brian ain't a thing...</i>

09:09.967 --> 09:12.928
Benny worked
with the Safdie bros before me?

09:13.011 --> 09:14.388
He hasn't even seen <i>Good Time.</i>

09:14.471 --> 09:16.932
He's just an <i>Uncut Gems</i>
bandwagon ho!

09:17.015 --> 09:18.433
<i>"Brian Ain't a Thing"</i>
<i>is climbing</i>

09:18.517 --> 09:20.060
<i>the</i> Billboard <i>charts</i>
<i>as we speak.</i>

09:20.143 --> 09:22.354
<i>People are ditching</i>
<i>our line for Latrine.</i>

09:22.437 --> 09:24.523
Goddamn it,
these fashionistas are fickle.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.149
We've got to respond.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.194
Hey, hon, any way I could get
the living room to myself?

09:29.278 --> 09:31.196
Game's on,
and I got a couple fellas

09:31.280 --> 09:32.823
- from Home Theater
coming over...

09:32.906 --> 09:35.575
- Oh!
- Someone tell
this Geek Squad bitch

09:35.659 --> 09:37.577
to GTFO before I put him

09:37.661 --> 09:40.289
- to sleep for good.
- Yeah, Terry!

09:40.372 --> 09:44.126
We're in the middle of a fucking
fashion war, you moron.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.627
I'm so sorry, honey.

09:45.711 --> 09:47.421
I thought you were taking
the kids to your mother's.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.173
<i>Come on, Tru, I could fuck</i>
<i>these guys up in sleep mode.</i>

09:50.257 --> 09:52.968
- <i>Let me at 'em.</i>
- Fuck 'em up, boo.

09:56.805 --> 09:59.599
Look at this punk-ass
FedEx delivery boy.

09:59.683 --> 10:02.102
You better flap
those wings, playboy.

10:06.356 --> 10:09.651
<i>- "My Dale-icous</i>
<i>Dan-Dale-ion..."</i>
- Aah!

10:09.735 --> 10:12.279
- What do we have here?

10:12.362 --> 10:15.449
We've lost Drip N' Save
and Yes Anderson,

10:15.532 --> 10:17.409
but I spoke to Phyllis,
and Schwimmer's

10:17.492 --> 10:19.161
is still holding strong
for Latrine.

10:19.244 --> 10:22.748
<i>Ah, ah, ah,</i>
<i>who's the hype-bitch now?</i>

10:22.831 --> 10:24.333
<i>- Ah, ah, ah...</i>
- They're hacking the lair!

10:24.416 --> 10:26.960
Hiroki, quick,
clear your browser history.

10:27.044 --> 10:29.880
- Goddamn it!
- We have a traitor
in our midst.

10:29.963 --> 10:33.175
- Dale!
- He's been conspiring
with the enemy, my liege.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.926
<i>Who's the</i>
<i>hype-bitch now?</i>

10:35.010 --> 10:37.554
- How could you?!
- Benny, I know
what you're thinking.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.723
And it's not what it looks like.
I was just sexting

10:39.806 --> 10:41.141
with Lily via carrier pigeon.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.185
She's Off-Brian, Dale!

10:43.268 --> 10:45.520
- Please! I just...
- We're all making sacrifices

10:45.604 --> 10:46.897
for the war effort, Dale.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.398
Man, what the fuck
have you sacrificed?!

10:48.482 --> 10:50.233
Uh-uh, we can use him, Benny.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.111
Let's send him
across enemy lines.

10:53.195 --> 10:56.114
Get information from the girl.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.371
I built a back door into
Cerise's memory as a fail-safe.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.373
- You'll only have a...
- Let me guess.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.708
A few minutes
before Cerise detects me?

11:06.792 --> 11:10.045
And her memory is stored in some
crazy Matrix-y shrine room?

11:10.128 --> 11:12.964
And once I find the memory,
you'll export it

11:13.048 --> 11:16.218
to a super convenient
yet very important USB drive?

11:16.301 --> 11:18.095
Good luck.

11:25.977 --> 11:28.146
I'm in.

11:28.230 --> 11:30.023
Yo!

11:30.107 --> 11:32.901
This would be a dope-ass spot
for a Rihanna music video.

11:45.580 --> 11:46.998
<i>The gang gang's toast.</i>

11:47.082 --> 11:48.583
<i>Especially after Truman hears</i>

11:48.667 --> 11:50.043
<i>that you tried to murder me.</i>

11:50.127 --> 11:51.753
<i>- Aah!</i>
<i>- Oh, shit!</i>

11:51.837 --> 11:53.630
Gotcha, binch.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.340
Chet, I found it.

11:55.424 --> 11:57.092
<i>Pull me out.</i>

11:57.175 --> 11:59.678
Hurry! Hurry!

11:59.761 --> 12:02.264
Oh, no! Uli!

12:02.347 --> 12:04.057
- She's onto us!
- Oh, my God!

12:04.141 --> 12:06.226
They're here!

12:10.480 --> 12:13.650
You didn't think you were
getting away that easy, did you?

12:13.733 --> 12:15.444
- Oh, shit!

12:15.527 --> 12:18.447
Chet, get me
the fuck out of here!

12:27.789 --> 12:31.042
Uli! Oh, no!

12:32.919 --> 12:34.754
Chet? Chet, are you there?!

12:34.838 --> 12:37.340
Chet can't
save you now.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.968
He can't even save himself.

12:40.051 --> 12:42.095
Aah!

12:42.179 --> 12:43.680
Chet?

12:48.810 --> 12:51.938
Chet! I mean Jacquomogo...
whatever your name is!

12:52.022 --> 12:53.273
You're hurt!

12:53.356 --> 12:55.484
Oh, you did good, kid.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.486
Will you tell Truman I love...

12:57.569 --> 12:59.696
I-I mean, I-I miss... I mean...

12:59.779 --> 13:02.324
Oh, just say hi
to Truman for me, will you?

13:10.415 --> 13:12.209
Dale?

13:12.292 --> 13:14.252
What, what are you
doing here, my sweet,

13:14.336 --> 13:16.379
sweet saltine?

13:16.463 --> 13:18.215
Shh.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.176
- Oh, fuck!

13:21.259 --> 13:24.554
Benny and Hiroki wanted me to
spy on you, but I can't do it!

13:24.638 --> 13:28.183
Gah! I am so sick
of this stupid war!

13:28.266 --> 13:30.477
Goddamn it!

13:32.020 --> 13:33.396
Let's run away, Dale.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.815
We could live in the forest.
Just think of it.

13:35.899 --> 13:39.653
Camping and composting
and birthing a baby deer.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.655
Okay. Let's do it.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.490
Tomorrow morning
we leave for good.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.617
Right after I say goodbye
to my parents.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.328
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.997
I'll say good night...
till it be morrow.

13:51.081 --> 13:53.375
Wait, forgot
to give you one more thing.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.252
- What?

14:00.423 --> 14:02.259
Hell yeah, boy! Get some!

14:02.342 --> 14:03.843
Come on!

14:13.019 --> 14:15.814
Bri-jangles!

14:15.897 --> 14:18.316
- Intruder in sector kitchen!
- <i>You!</i>
- D?

14:18.400 --> 14:20.652
- What are you doing here?
- Cerise lied to you.

14:20.735 --> 14:23.196
And I can prove it!
It's all on this flash drive,

14:23.280 --> 14:25.657
- little Roomba ho!
- <i>Oh, this thing?</i>

14:25.740 --> 14:27.742
- <i>Whoops.</i>
- No!

14:27.826 --> 14:29.369
You motherfucker!

14:29.452 --> 14:31.705
Velcro this prisoner
to the basement wall.

14:31.788 --> 14:34.332
Truman, please!
You have to believe me!

14:34.416 --> 14:37.043
What in the Sean
is going on out here?

14:37.127 --> 14:39.504
What's going on is
there's a freakin' mess

14:39.588 --> 14:41.256
you need to clean up.

14:41.339 --> 14:43.341
Hey, Tru, I got a couple
of surprises for you.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.343
I think you're gonna like 'em.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.265
How do you like it?

14:50.348 --> 14:52.434
That's a Madagascarian
lionfish.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.019
Supes poisonous.

14:54.102 --> 14:55.687
It's amazing,
Bri-dog.

14:55.770 --> 14:59.024
Now for the second part
of my surprise.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.195
<i>- Ah, ah, ah...</i>
<i>- Hey, Hiroki.</i>

15:04.279 --> 15:05.530
<i>Check this shit out.</i>

15:05.614 --> 15:08.325
No, no, no!

15:08.408 --> 15:10.076
Is the skate bowl okay?!

15:10.160 --> 15:11.911
Tell me the skate bowl's okay!

15:11.995 --> 15:14.664
All hands on deck,
fashion emergency!

15:14.748 --> 15:16.958
To the subcopter!

15:27.969 --> 15:29.429
Caw-caw!

15:37.604 --> 15:40.231
You know, it's one thing
to fuck with a man's brand,

15:40.315 --> 15:43.360
but to fuck
with a man's brick and mortar?

15:43.443 --> 15:46.446
Boo-hoo-hoo! Is wittle baby
sad about his store?

15:46.529 --> 15:48.114
That's it!

15:51.660 --> 15:54.621
Let's settle this
like designers.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.289
Oh, you're on.

15:56.373 --> 15:58.333
But this time the loser

15:58.416 --> 16:01.294
leaves Fairfax... forever.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.880
Oh, you're on, bitch boy.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.965
It's a drop-off!

16:18.728 --> 16:20.522
Mine eyes doth fulleth

16:20.605 --> 16:22.565
with love, my D-Bone.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.735
And mine belly doth fulleth
with hunger.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.071
I'm gonna go see if my net
has caught us some brekky.

16:29.823 --> 16:32.200
My big boy tent!

16:32.283 --> 16:34.577
I thought
I'd never see you again, girl.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.007
What's wrong, my love?

16:48.091 --> 16:50.385
I can't believe I'm saying this,

16:50.468 --> 16:52.679
but I have
to go back to Fairfax.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.597
But we've made a home here.

16:54.681 --> 16:58.351
Plus this mother deer is
six centimeters dilated.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.979
- Lily...

17:01.062 --> 17:03.148
I want you to see me
not as a boy...

17:03.231 --> 17:05.233
but as a big boy.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.485
And as much as I want to help
birth a baby deer with you,

17:07.569 --> 17:09.446
more than anything in the world,

17:09.529 --> 17:11.781
a big boy knows running
away from his problems

17:11.865 --> 17:14.033
is no solution, and worse,

17:14.117 --> 17:15.618
it's habit-forming.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.371
My friends need me.

17:18.455 --> 17:21.124
Wait, uh, so what are we?!

17:21.207 --> 17:23.126
It's complicated!

17:25.670 --> 17:27.547
Hey, Truman.

17:27.630 --> 17:30.133
Uh, here's
that polyester fabric

17:30.216 --> 17:31.968
you asked for.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.470
Polyester wha...?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.764
Oh...

17:35.847 --> 17:38.433
<i>Hey, Tru-boo.</i>
<i>Ready for the big day?</i>

17:38.516 --> 17:41.519
<i>We're totally gonna annihilate</i>
<i>those stupid Latrine fools.</i>

17:41.603 --> 17:43.605
<i>The gang gang's toast.</i>

17:43.688 --> 17:47.817
<i>Especially after Truman hears</i>
<i>that you tried to murder me.</i>

17:47.901 --> 17:48.902
<i>Where did you get that?</i>

17:48.985 --> 17:50.653
They were my best friends.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.031
And you lied to me.
How could you?

17:53.114 --> 17:54.365
<i>If you'll just let me explain.</i>

17:54.449 --> 17:55.992
Nah, I should've listened

17:56.075 --> 17:57.452
to my friends from the start.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.454
I-I'm done letting you play
with my emotions.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.539
You were my first love, girl.

18:01.623 --> 18:02.957
<i>And I still am.</i>

18:03.041 --> 18:04.459
Nah. Not anymore.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.377
We're donezo.

18:06.461 --> 18:08.087
<i>Come on, Truman,</i>
<i>no, don't do this.</i>

18:08.171 --> 18:11.049
Siri, play breakup music.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.176
<i>Siri? How dare you?</i>

18:13.259 --> 18:15.386
<i>Playing breakdance music.</i>

18:15.470 --> 18:17.847
<i>- Jesus fucking Christ, Siri!</i>

18:17.931 --> 18:19.432
<i>No, no, no, what are you doing?</i>

18:19.516 --> 18:20.934
<i>You're gonna regret this,</i>
<i>Truman.</i>

18:21.017 --> 18:22.894
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>Truman, no.</i>
- You're garbage, Cerise.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.313
- <i>Truman! Truman! Truman!</i>
- And guess where garbage goes.

18:25.396 --> 18:27.148
- <i>Ugh! Stop it! Get off me! No!</i>
- The trash.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.572
- Tru? Tru, is that you?

18:34.656 --> 18:36.783
D, holy shit! Okay.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.660
You were right about Cerise,
we have to talk about it,

18:38.743 --> 18:40.411
and I'm-a do your homework
until college if you forgive me,

18:40.495 --> 18:42.247
but right now we got to get the
fuck up out of here before they

18:42.330 --> 18:44.624
- chloroform our asses!
- Then let's fucking go, boy!

18:46.751 --> 18:48.461
Truman, bud.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.380
Had a quick questio...

18:50.463 --> 18:51.631
Uh, Brianna, where's Truman?

18:53.675 --> 18:55.593
You know
what I do at my lame-ass

18:55.677 --> 18:57.720
Best Buy job, Brian?

18:57.804 --> 18:59.722
You jerk off
to hentai in the bathroom?

18:59.806 --> 19:02.475
I fix shit like flash drives!

19:02.559 --> 19:04.769
That's right, Geek Squad, bitch!

19:04.853 --> 19:06.771
Son of a Bisquick!

19:06.855 --> 19:09.440
Off-Brian stans, assemble.

19:09.524 --> 19:11.651
It's drop-off time.

19:11.734 --> 19:14.445
That was the hottest thing
you've ever done.

19:14.529 --> 19:16.948
We're totally gonna have another
baby when this is all over.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.871
Tronté, have you seen Dale?

19:22.954 --> 19:25.039
He's white and... that's it.

19:25.123 --> 19:27.125
God, I love pre-show energy.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.710
What's wrong?

19:28.793 --> 19:31.129
I don't know, I just...
I think I took it too far

19:31.212 --> 19:33.381
with Dale,
and I kind of miss my...

19:33.464 --> 19:36.301
Gang gang!

19:36.384 --> 19:38.052
What the hell
are you doing here?

19:38.136 --> 19:40.054
I came to apologize, dawg.
For Cerise.

19:40.138 --> 19:42.223
For the dance. For the uniforms.

19:42.307 --> 19:44.309
For destroying my store!

19:44.392 --> 19:46.311
All of it. I'm so sorry, y'all.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.187
You're my bro for life, Benny.

19:48.271 --> 19:51.024
There's nobody I'd rather
collab with, if you'll have me.

19:52.150 --> 19:54.360
I'm sorry I was such a dick.

19:54.444 --> 19:56.821
I guess I was just jealous
'cause everyone was, like,

19:56.905 --> 19:58.531
evolving and hooking up,

19:58.615 --> 20:00.867
and I was feeling left behind.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.328
But you should be
with whoever makes you happy.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.747
I know
it's cornball as fuck,

20:05.830 --> 20:08.541
but gang gang makes me happy.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.877
Aw! You guys!

20:10.960 --> 20:12.879
Well, you know, I was gonna

20:12.962 --> 20:14.964
have Tronté
and the henchmen do it, but...

20:15.048 --> 20:18.176
it's only right that my
most loyal Dorito winners

20:18.259 --> 20:21.554
walk on Latrine's behest.

20:21.638 --> 20:23.556
- So...

20:23.640 --> 20:26.267
- won't you do us the honors?
- Yeah, but I got bad news.

20:26.351 --> 20:27.977
The first category's normcore,

20:28.061 --> 20:29.687
and Brian's got
Dr. Phil walking.

20:29.771 --> 20:32.190
That traitor! How are we
supposed to compete with that?

20:32.273 --> 20:35.234
I believe
I might be of some assistance.

20:35.318 --> 20:37.278
- Yo! Dale!
- Oh, my God!

20:37.362 --> 20:38.738
Squad's back together.

20:38.821 --> 20:41.032
Let's fucking

20:41.115 --> 20:43.368
build!

20:43.451 --> 20:45.995
Twinkle, twinkle,
little stars.

20:46.079 --> 20:49.082
This fashion show is
for the whole enchilada.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.667
Five rounds, five models,

20:50.750 --> 20:52.919
- five drops.
- That's right, Jules.

20:53.002 --> 20:55.546
Hiroki vers' Brian.

20:55.630 --> 20:56.923
Loser leaves town.

20:57.006 --> 20:58.716
Ready, set...

20:58.800 --> 21:00.635
<i>Round one.</i>

21:00.718 --> 21:02.387
<i>Dale versus...</i>

21:02.470 --> 21:03.930
<i>Dr. Phil.</i>

21:04.013 --> 21:06.641
<i>for the cameras, baby...</i>

21:06.724 --> 21:08.685
<i>Motherfuckin'</i>
<i>glow star attack?!</i>

21:11.020 --> 21:12.730
<i>Okay!</i>

21:12.814 --> 21:14.524
<i>for the cameras, baby...</i>

21:14.607 --> 21:15.692
- Dale!
- Damn!

21:16.985 --> 21:18.695
<i>Round two.</i>

21:18.778 --> 21:21.072
<i>Benny versus...</i>

21:21.155 --> 21:22.949
<i>Yung Polluter.</i>

21:23.032 --> 21:25.284
<i>We got Iron Man</i>
<i>up in this bitch!</i>

21:26.619 --> 21:28.830
- <i>Harpoon arm?!</i>

21:30.957 --> 21:32.709
<i>Tillamook got smoked.</i>

21:32.792 --> 21:34.961
<i>Derica</i>

21:35.044 --> 21:37.797
<i>versus Greta Thunberg.</i>

21:37.880 --> 21:39.340
<i>Save the planet, y'all.</i>

21:39.424 --> 21:40.550
Hyah!

21:42.301 --> 21:43.636
<i>Ooh,</i>
<i>that's a clout-tality!</i>

21:43.720 --> 21:45.471
- Ha, damn!
- Yeah!

21:45.555 --> 21:51.019

<i>Truman versus Brianna.</i>

21:51.644 --> 21:53.062
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

21:53.104 --> 21:55.440
<i>Whoa!</i>

21:55.523 --> 21:56.983
- Truman!

21:57.066 --> 21:58.818
<i>Final round.</i>

21:58.901 --> 22:01.279
<i>Hiroki versus Brian.</i>

22:01.362 --> 22:04.115
Come on, Hiroki,
flex on these bitches!

22:06.659 --> 22:08.119
<i>Serve, bitch!</i>

22:08.202 --> 22:10.955
<i>Oh, this motherfucker!</i>

22:14.333 --> 22:16.294
- Hiroki!
- No!

22:17.920 --> 22:20.548
<i>Yo! Gang gang!</i>

22:22.467 --> 22:25.595
<i>Yo, yo-yo-yo-yo! This is crazy!</i>

22:38.524 --> 22:40.068
And the winner

22:40.151 --> 22:43.071
of the Fairfax Drop-Off is...

22:43.154 --> 22:45.073
Off-Brian!

22:46.616 --> 22:47.658
- No!
- This isn't happening!

22:47.742 --> 22:48.910
This isn't
how it's supposed to be!

22:48.993 --> 22:51.287
Nana, nana,
poo-poo.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.165
I win, you lose.

22:54.248 --> 22:56.626
Blacklisted for life.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.628
I'm proud of you, Brian.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.172
You really thought
outside the box tee.

23:01.255 --> 23:03.424
The block is yours.

23:03.508 --> 23:07.136
Fare thee well,
my sweet Fairfax.

23:09.931 --> 23:11.265
I can't believe this.

23:11.349 --> 23:13.142
He's really going.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.396
Wait.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.816
Hiroki, stop.

23:22.318 --> 23:24.487
You are Fairfax.

23:24.570 --> 23:27.115
All I've ever wanted was
for you to collab with me

23:27.198 --> 23:29.659
or, or think one of my ideas
was cool.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.495
Truth is, henching for you

23:32.578 --> 23:34.789
were some of the best years
of my life.

23:34.872 --> 23:37.625
You're the reason I put
shoes on the patio chair, man.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.585
And if you just...

23:39.669 --> 23:40.920
Shut up.

23:41.003 --> 23:43.339
Just shut up.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.508
You had me at "collab."

23:45.591 --> 23:47.760
So, what do you say?

23:47.844 --> 23:49.804
Want to do this thing?

23:49.887 --> 23:52.098
Me and you?
Off-Brian and Latrine?

23:52.181 --> 23:54.851
You want to collab for real?

23:54.934 --> 23:57.937
Style comes and goes.

23:58.020 --> 24:00.022
But friendship lasts forever.

24:02.483 --> 24:04.610
- No way.

24:08.072 --> 24:10.741
And lo!

24:10.825 --> 24:14.078
The balance hath been restored

24:14.162 --> 24:16.831
in ye olde Fairfax.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.708
Stop talking in stanzas, pidge!

24:18.791 --> 24:20.751
You confusing me! But yeah.

24:20.835 --> 24:22.753
Shit's back to normal,
so we all good.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.635
What the f...?

24:29.719 --> 24:31.804
<i>You think you know fashion?</i>

24:31.888 --> 24:35.808
<i>I'm going to show you</i>
<i>the future of fashion.</i>

24:35.892 --> 24:38.186
<i>Because you can't spell</i>
<i>"Fairfax"</i>

24:38.269 --> 24:40.563
<i>without "A-I."</i>

24:40.646 --> 24:43.816
<i>Introducing... Cerise.</i>

24:43.900 --> 24:45.151
By Cerise.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.777
Oh, shit.

24:46.861 --> 24:48.237
- Truman!
- Truman?

24:48.321 --> 24:50.656
What the fuck did you do, dawg?

25:37.787 --> 25:39.747
Chirp.
