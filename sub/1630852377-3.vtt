WEBVTT

00:01.703 --> 00:04.542
- [Narrator] More than
10 billion vehicles sold.

00:05.242 --> 00:08.282
More than General Motors, Ford,

00:08.448 --> 00:12.524
Toyota, and Volkswagen combined.

00:12.624 --> 00:16.632
- There are thousands
upon thousands of us

00:16.632 --> 00:19.469
who were truly influenced by

00:20.238 --> 00:21.106
these toys.

00:22.375 --> 00:25.114
Matchbox cars, Hot Wheels cars.

00:25.213 --> 00:28.420
They get in your brain,
they stick with it.

00:28.486 --> 00:31.893
- [Narrator] As car culture
sweeps America in the 1950s,

00:32.160 --> 00:35.734
a metal worker in England
creates a brand new industry.

00:38.540 --> 00:42.379
- They found a niche
market that was void.

00:42.513 --> 00:44.718
There was nobody in that market.

00:44.818 --> 00:47.657
- [Narrator] But when
a US rival emerges-

00:47.657 --> 00:48.826
- Hey, kid.

00:48.826 --> 00:49.793
What ya got there?

00:51.764 --> 00:53.968
- He owns Mattel,
and his grandson

00:54.102 --> 00:55.806
is playing with
somebody else's toy.

00:56.072 --> 00:59.111
You can't seriously be
proposing to take on Matchbox.

00:59.177 --> 01:02.284
- [Narrator] The innovations
come fast and furious.

01:02.384 --> 01:05.456
- Matchbox did not
see Hot Wheels coming.

01:05.524 --> 01:09.231
- Hot Wheels was always
pushing the impossible,

01:09.363 --> 01:12.571
and I'm not sure if
Matchbox did that.

01:12.704 --> 01:15.309
- [Narrator] The
toy car race is on.

01:15.442 --> 01:18.113
- Our toy car will
beat the real car

01:18.213 --> 01:20.118
before it even rolls
off the assembly line.

01:20.318 --> 01:21.320
(car whooshing)

01:21.486 --> 01:22.489
- We could go bankrupt.

01:22.556 --> 01:24.292
- So, you just wanna go
down without a fight?

01:24.392 --> 01:28.634
- I think I would say that
Mattel out-childed them.

01:29.736 --> 01:31.807
- [Narrator] And it's
a fight for millions.

01:31.807 --> 01:32.843
- There are generations

01:33.109 --> 01:36.549
whose lives were transformed
by these little cars.

01:37.483 --> 01:38.954
It sparked the imagination

01:38.954 --> 01:41.659
in ways that it's
really hard to quantify.

01:45.766 --> 01:48.371
(tense music)

02:01.396 --> 02:04.134
(energetic music)

02:08.175 --> 02:10.213
- [Narrator] Two years
after the Allied victory

02:10.279 --> 02:13.886
in World War II, nearly three
million British soldiers

02:13.886 --> 02:16.191
are still looking for work.

02:16.290 --> 02:18.629
- European cities and
manufacturing capitals

02:18.729 --> 02:22.034
are in ruins,
devastated by bombing.

02:22.134 --> 02:24.473
The scope of destruction
is really stunning.

02:24.573 --> 02:26.711
- World War II brought
about general prosperity

02:26.711 --> 02:27.914
for the United States,

02:28.180 --> 02:31.587
but didn't do so for the United
Kingdom, our principal ally.

02:31.653 --> 02:34.491
Britain, after the war,
was functionally bankrupt.

02:37.597 --> 02:41.605
- [Narrator] Even so, Navy
buddies Leslie and Rodney Smith

02:41.672 --> 02:45.279
have just gone all in to
start a die-casting business.

02:45.479 --> 02:48.417
(flames crackling)

02:49.754 --> 02:54.229
- Die-casting is when you take
molten metal or liquid metal

02:54.329 --> 02:57.902
and you actually force
it into a die or a mold

02:57.902 --> 03:00.340
to create a finished product.

03:00.473 --> 03:02.713
- They combined
their first names,

03:02.812 --> 03:05.984
Leslie and Rodney, to
become Lesney Products

03:05.984 --> 03:08.956
and made industrial components.

03:09.223 --> 03:14.166
- Car door handles, windshield
wipers, nuts and bolts.

03:14.767 --> 03:16.905
It wasn't making them very
rich, that's for sure.

03:18.441 --> 03:21.180
- [Narrator] But a third
partner named Jack Odell

03:21.246 --> 03:24.352
is about to send
them down a new path.

03:24.519 --> 03:25.688
- He's a curious cat.

03:25.755 --> 03:29.930
He grew up rather poor in
a rougher part of London.

03:30.197 --> 03:32.367
And in fact, he said that
he got kicked outta school

03:32.501 --> 03:34.505
at age 13, but he
goes on to hold down

03:34.605 --> 03:38.981
a number of small, odd
jobs as a teenager.

03:39.214 --> 03:42.286
- When he gets outta the Army,
he gets a job doing die-cast.

03:42.352 --> 03:45.258
And he likes it, but he
wants to go out on his own.

03:45.358 --> 03:47.429
So, he buys some of
the tooling equipment

03:47.597 --> 03:49.233
and he needs a place to go.

03:49.398 --> 03:51.871
- Jack Odell had special skills

03:51.871 --> 03:55.411
as a designer and a die-caster

03:55.512 --> 03:58.482
that rapidly got enlisted
by Lesney Products.

04:00.319 --> 04:01.690
- Come on, give me
a challenge, huh?

04:01.790 --> 04:05.296
Something beside windshield
wipers. (laughing)

04:07.366 --> 04:09.271
(reverent music)

04:09.403 --> 04:10.974
- [Narrator] Jack
Odell will soon launch

04:11.274 --> 04:15.683
a revolutionary toy line
worth over $100 million

04:15.750 --> 04:19.256
that will produce more than
five million cars per week

04:19.322 --> 04:23.397
and sell more than three
billion in 130 countries.

04:25.835 --> 04:28.439
But toward the end of 1947,

04:28.540 --> 04:30.845
Lesney is about to
hit a rough patch.

04:30.945 --> 04:34.417
- One of the lulls in
the die-casting business

04:34.484 --> 04:36.956
typically happened in November
and December each year,

04:37.022 --> 04:40.964
as companies drew down
their inventories of parts.

04:41.030 --> 04:44.269
So, other die-casting
companies had gotten into toys

04:44.436 --> 04:46.306
for the holiday buying season.

04:47.710 --> 04:49.581
- [Narrator] To keep
money coming in,

04:49.647 --> 04:54.155
Lesney agrees to manufacture
parts for a toy cap gun.

04:54.321 --> 04:56.459
They didn't have the initiative

04:56.593 --> 04:58.731
to pursue making
that toy themselves.

04:58.831 --> 05:01.736
They were just doing
the metal die-casting

05:01.836 --> 05:04.041
as a commission
from another firm.

05:04.041 --> 05:05.310
(electricity zapping)

05:05.442 --> 05:07.180
- [Narrator] The
Space Outlaw ray gun

05:07.313 --> 05:09.518
hit shelves in
time for Christmas.

05:09.585 --> 05:13.959
It's a modest hit, but Jack
Odell sees more potential.

05:15.461 --> 05:19.469
The following Christmas, Odell
decides to make his own toy.

05:19.603 --> 05:21.874
It's unlike anything
on the market,

05:21.974 --> 05:24.847
yet familiar to millions
of British children.

05:28.753 --> 05:32.394
- There were a lotta road
rollers around London

05:32.493 --> 05:35.333
repairing the damage
done from World War II,

05:35.466 --> 05:37.604
so it was a
recognizable vehicle.

05:37.737 --> 05:39.508
- [Narrator] His
steamroller is innovative

05:39.608 --> 05:42.881
in its small size, but
far from a breakout hit.

05:45.553 --> 05:48.525
Lesney Products scrapes by
over the next four years,

05:48.625 --> 05:52.666
releasing one new die-cast
toy every Christmas.

05:52.766 --> 05:54.770
- They decided, "Let's do
more construction stuff

05:54.870 --> 05:57.107
"'cause that's what
the kids are seeing."

05:57.374 --> 06:02.417
Most of the early toys were
not necessarily successful,

06:03.452 --> 06:06.491
so Rodney Smith left the
company in the early-'50s.

06:09.565 --> 06:11.034
- [Narrator] With
one partner gone,

06:11.100 --> 06:16.010
Odell is desperate for a hit
toy in the winter of 1953.

06:16.010 --> 06:17.078
(triumphant trumpet music)

06:17.345 --> 06:20.653
And he finds inspiration in
the most newsworthy event

06:20.719 --> 06:24.726
of the times: the coronation
of Queen Elizabeth II.

06:27.532 --> 06:30.905
Odell's painstakingly
detailed royal State Coach

06:30.938 --> 06:34.612
is his biggest model yet at
four-and-a-half inches long,

06:34.745 --> 06:37.618
with eight horses
and four riders.

06:37.784 --> 06:38.754
- There was no toy gun.

06:38.820 --> 06:41.826
That coronation coach
was extremely intricate.

06:41.925 --> 06:44.297
- Leslie Smith
actually had his doubts

06:44.396 --> 06:47.236
that that model could be
scaled down that small

06:47.402 --> 06:48.773
and get the detail.

06:48.872 --> 06:52.011
But the craft master
that Jack Odell was,

06:52.011 --> 06:54.015
he got the thing down

06:54.081 --> 06:57.656
and it turned out being their
first million-selling toy.

06:59.491 --> 07:00.594
(flames crackling)

07:00.661 --> 07:03.533
- [Narrator] But Odell knows
the coach is a novelty.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.940
To keep growing, he needs
an idea that will last.

07:09.577 --> 07:11.448
Meanwhile...
(pensive music)

07:11.648 --> 07:13.619
5,000 miles away,

07:13.686 --> 07:17.058
unlike the destruction in
Europe after World War II,

07:17.058 --> 07:18.628
for veterans back at home,

07:18.728 --> 07:21.868
the United States
offers opportunity.

07:21.968 --> 07:24.138
- When the soldiers
come back from war,

07:24.138 --> 07:25.307
the GI Bill is transformative.

07:25.574 --> 07:29.115
It is designed to essentially
give these returning soldiers

07:29.181 --> 07:31.620
something to come home to,
money to go to college,

07:31.786 --> 07:32.888
and support to buy a home.

07:35.927 --> 07:38.866
- Nowhere in America
does that optimism thrive

07:39.000 --> 07:41.037
more than sunny
Southern California,

07:42.039 --> 07:43.440
where the husband-and-wife team

07:43.608 --> 07:45.812
who run Mattel are cashing in.

07:45.879 --> 07:48.685
- Elliot and Ruth Handler
were the original dynamic duo

07:48.785 --> 07:51.256
of the toy industry,
no question about it.

07:51.256 --> 07:53.895
- Elliot's role was
the artistic one,

07:53.994 --> 07:56.432
and Elliott's big
thing was playability.

07:57.535 --> 08:00.206
What is the play
value of this toy?

08:00.473 --> 08:02.744
- And Ruth was more than just
someone who did the books

08:02.878 --> 08:05.650
and the accounting
for that business,

08:05.817 --> 08:07.153
even in the early days.

08:08.523 --> 08:10.960
- [Narrator] By 1953,
the young company

08:11.026 --> 08:14.967
has just one novelty hit,
called the Uke-A-Doodle.

08:16.036 --> 08:18.576
- But he didn't come up
with that great idea,

08:18.709 --> 08:21.179
that toy that would
sort of live on.

08:22.582 --> 08:24.519
- [Narrator] Elliot Handler
is desperate to dream up

08:24.619 --> 08:27.659
Mattel's next bestseller
to keep his company going.

08:28.793 --> 08:32.534
And he finds inspiration
while stuck in traffic.

08:37.844 --> 08:40.616
(pensive music)

08:43.522 --> 08:46.393
- The car companies made
some not-so-exciting cars

08:46.594 --> 08:48.297
in the late-1940s.

08:48.497 --> 08:49.466
So, in the 1950s,

08:49.533 --> 08:52.573
some great cars started
to finally come out

08:52.672 --> 08:54.978
and the world was just
getting really excited

08:55.044 --> 08:58.383
about the future of cars
and what they look like.

08:58.550 --> 09:00.387
- People had more money.

09:00.554 --> 09:02.124
They were buying cars.

09:02.124 --> 09:03.760
All of the cars had

09:03.894 --> 09:06.566
rocket-looking,
airplane-looking,

09:06.665 --> 09:10.272
there were tail fins,
there were nose cones.

09:10.540 --> 09:14.212
America was all geared up
for the automotive industry.

09:14.212 --> 09:15.281
(car horn honking)

09:15.549 --> 09:18.254
- Vehicles made a statement
when you looked at them

09:18.555 --> 09:20.626
and they really said
something about the owner.

09:20.759 --> 09:22.094
They said something
about the person

09:22.094 --> 09:23.163
that purchased that car.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.603
There were so many different
styles to choose from

09:26.703 --> 09:29.909
that it could reflect
a person's personality.

09:30.811 --> 09:31.846
- [Narrator] Handler has an idea

09:31.946 --> 09:35.653
to tap into this new car
culture for the toy market.

09:35.820 --> 09:37.657
He spends weeks on his design,

09:37.824 --> 09:40.261
which he calls the Dream Car.

09:40.261 --> 09:42.432
- The Dream Car that Elliot drew

09:42.566 --> 09:45.104
was a very
futuristic-looking car.

09:45.104 --> 09:46.808
It had a bubble top on it

09:46.908 --> 09:49.546
that looked like a
gunner part of a B-52.

09:50.247 --> 09:51.950
Everything is space age.

09:53.988 --> 09:55.725
- [Narrator] Mattel
will eventually be worth

09:55.925 --> 09:57.595
almost $8 billion,

09:58.663 --> 10:01.468
have the best-selling toy
of all time, Hot Wheels,

10:01.536 --> 10:04.007
and the most iconic
doll on the planet.

10:08.715 --> 10:10.787
But six years before Barbie,

10:10.853 --> 10:14.293
Elliot's struggling company
can't afford a costly flop.

10:15.563 --> 10:18.768
And his car design
is just a pipe dream.

10:21.239 --> 10:24.045
(pensive music)

10:26.048 --> 10:29.923
Overseas, Jack Odell is
still trying to follow up

10:29.989 --> 10:34.196
his coronation coach success,
but he needs a new hook.

10:40.208 --> 10:41.043
- What's this?

10:42.112 --> 10:43.715
(Jack exhaling)

10:43.882 --> 10:46.319
Anne, what's the idea, hmm?

10:46.621 --> 10:49.126
- There's a restriction
at his daughter's school.

10:49.225 --> 10:51.698
Kids are not allowed
to bring toys to school

10:51.798 --> 10:54.001
unless they can fit
inside a matchbox.

10:55.136 --> 10:57.608
- A light bulb goes
off in Jack's head.

10:57.675 --> 11:00.280
What if he takes the first
toy that he ever made,

11:00.280 --> 11:02.049
the road roller steamroller,

11:02.116 --> 11:05.924
and made it small enough to
fit inside that matchbox?

11:05.957 --> 11:08.997
- [Narrator] Now, the race to
bring toy cars to the market

11:09.163 --> 11:10.733
and lay claim to
what will become

11:10.899 --> 11:12.736
a multi-billion dollar industry

11:12.870 --> 11:16.310
(rising suspenseful music)
is on.

11:20.283 --> 11:21.887
(pensive music)

11:21.954 --> 11:25.026
Elliot Handler has put
Mattel's limited resources

11:25.193 --> 11:27.799
behind his bold new toy idea.

11:28.933 --> 11:32.007
Hoping to cash in on the
1950s car culture boom,

11:32.106 --> 11:34.745
he's built what he
calls the Dream Car.

11:35.947 --> 11:40.288
- It was kind of a cross between
a fighter jet with a car.

11:40.288 --> 11:43.094
It had bulges at certain places,

11:43.194 --> 11:46.133
it was plastic and metal,
and it was a good size.

11:46.232 --> 11:48.538
It was probably nine
to 10 inches long,

11:48.671 --> 11:50.240
and it came in a few colors.

11:50.340 --> 11:55.016
- The Dream Car is a very
futuristic-looking car.

11:55.082 --> 11:59.424
This car looks like it's
something out of 1960

11:59.424 --> 12:01.629
and it's 1953.

12:01.729 --> 12:04.333
Elliot thought that
it would sell so well.

12:06.237 --> 12:07.807
- [Narrator] But it's a flop

12:07.941 --> 12:10.479
because of some
crucial missteps.

12:10.746 --> 12:15.087
- It was a good-looking
car, but it was expensive.

12:15.087 --> 12:19.964
It sold for a $1.98, which
doesn't sound like much now,

12:20.064 --> 12:22.836
but back then, it's
an awful lotta money

12:22.969 --> 12:26.543
for somebody to pay
for one toy car.

12:26.676 --> 12:28.981
- [Narrator] It's
almost $20 today.

12:29.114 --> 12:31.151
And that's not it's only flaw.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.423
- The Dream Car was
very much a toy.

12:34.423 --> 12:36.896
It was plastic, it was simple.

12:37.062 --> 12:39.233
Sure, it was well-designed.

12:39.300 --> 12:43.174
But if you just looked at
it, it's not screaming car.

12:43.174 --> 12:45.078
It's screaming toy.

12:45.144 --> 12:48.084
- It didn't really have
a playability factor,

12:48.117 --> 12:50.521
the ability for kids
to really play with it.

12:50.521 --> 12:52.391
There was no track,
no accessories.

12:52.391 --> 12:53.861
It didn't roll that well,

12:53.961 --> 12:56.199
and I think that's
why it was a failure.

12:56.299 --> 12:58.168
- [Narrator] But
Elliot doesn't give up.

12:58.168 --> 13:00.507
(tense music)

13:00.740 --> 13:06.351
- Elliot came up with another
car called the XP 1960.

13:07.152 --> 13:10.391
Smaller version, less parts.

13:10.491 --> 13:14.634
And that one also really
didn't do that well.

13:14.767 --> 13:18.908
A year later, they did the Dart.

13:19.041 --> 13:21.412
That had really cool colors,

13:22.716 --> 13:24.820
but all of those did
not last that long.

13:30.429 --> 13:31.833
- We just aren't
moving enough units.

13:31.966 --> 13:33.269
We need to focus
on something else.

13:33.302 --> 13:34.203
- Like what?

13:34.303 --> 13:36.174
- Like the new doll
I've been talking about.

13:36.240 --> 13:39.648
- I told you, little girls
don't want an adult doll.

13:39.914 --> 13:43.053
- And I told you, the car has
reached the end of the road.

13:47.796 --> 13:51.169
- Ruth Handler was one of
the first female leaders

13:51.303 --> 13:54.141
of a large
publicly-traded company.

13:54.141 --> 13:55.344
She was tough.

13:55.443 --> 13:58.349
- The '50s and the
'60s was not a time

13:58.449 --> 14:02.558
for the wife to be the
boss in any relationship.

14:02.791 --> 14:07.166
But you go to Mattel, and Ruth
Handler, she was the boss.

14:11.106 --> 14:12.041
- [Narrator] While
Elliot's dream

14:12.141 --> 14:15.348
of designing a
best-selling car is parked,

14:15.481 --> 14:18.622
Jack Odell is moving
full speed ahead.

14:18.854 --> 14:22.028
- The guys at Lesney think
Odell is really onto something.

14:22.094 --> 14:25.601
What if they were to
make little die-cast cars

14:25.601 --> 14:27.871
that are as intricately detailed

14:27.938 --> 14:30.777
as that coronation carriage
or the steamroller?

14:32.046 --> 14:34.752
- It is part of a tradition
in the United Kingdom

14:34.852 --> 14:37.657
going back to
miniature toy soldiers.

14:37.657 --> 14:40.194
There was a lot of
interest in intricacy

14:41.531 --> 14:44.236
and creating miniatures that
were like the real thing.

14:44.269 --> 14:47.709
- [Narrator] After six months
of painstaking production,

14:47.976 --> 14:51.449
Lesney Products releases a
line of four miniature vehicles

14:51.449 --> 14:53.319
unlike any ever made.

14:54.589 --> 14:57.127
- They were quite unique
because they were so small.

14:57.226 --> 15:00.600
They fit in a matchbox,
hence their name.

15:03.872 --> 15:06.845
- [Narrator] The
tractor, cement mixer,

15:06.978 --> 15:09.818
dump truck, and road roller

15:11.220 --> 15:15.194
make their debut in time
for the 1953 holiday season.

15:18.367 --> 15:21.006
But they're not
a hit right away.

15:21.139 --> 15:23.409
- The first
construction vehicles

15:24.411 --> 15:27.117
were not very fully detailed.

15:27.183 --> 15:29.321
At the time, they were
still not putting interiors

15:29.421 --> 15:32.092
or windows in anything, so
it was a hollow casting.

15:32.259 --> 15:34.598
Matchbox finally took off

15:34.831 --> 15:38.840
in 1954 when they came out
with the number-five model

15:39.006 --> 15:40.509
in the line, the London bus.

15:42.045 --> 15:42.980
Everybody in Great Britain

15:43.147 --> 15:44.917
knew what a London bus was,

15:45.017 --> 15:46.954
and then sales took
off from there.

15:48.223 --> 15:50.528
- [Narrator] It is this
success that inspires Odell

15:50.594 --> 15:54.368
to expand the Matchbox line
and begin designing

15:55.103 --> 15:57.208
cars.

15:57.307 --> 16:00.179
- You have this exact
replica of these cars.

16:00.345 --> 16:02.016
I mean, it was awesome.

16:02.083 --> 16:04.220
And they were tiny, they're
easy to carry around.

16:04.353 --> 16:06.858
Matchbox cars were affordable.

16:07.058 --> 16:09.396
Each car was 39 cents.

16:09.429 --> 16:13.137
It was so easy to make your
kids happy and buy them one.

16:13.304 --> 16:16.109
Matchbox became a sensation.

16:16.175 --> 16:19.315
They are selling millions
and millions of cars.

16:20.417 --> 16:24.291
- They found a niche
market that was void.

16:24.458 --> 16:26.428
There was nobody in that market.

16:26.495 --> 16:30.102
The Matchbox cars are the
cars you see on the road.

16:30.236 --> 16:32.273
Kids just wanted
to play with 'em.

16:32.373 --> 16:34.911
They were plentiful,
they were inexpensive,

16:35.078 --> 16:36.982
so you always had more than one.

16:37.182 --> 16:40.556
(reverent music)

16:40.623 --> 16:44.964
- [Narrator] By 1955, Lesney
Products scales up production,

16:45.063 --> 16:48.337
but Jack Odell keeps
tight control on quality,

16:48.403 --> 16:52.043
making sure Matchbox lives
up to his high standards.

16:53.212 --> 16:55.518
- Jack Odell did
not have an office.

16:55.617 --> 16:58.858
He would walk around the
floor of the factory,

16:58.957 --> 17:00.927
talk to the people that
were doing the work,

17:00.993 --> 17:04.067
and see how they liked it,
how things were working.

17:04.133 --> 17:07.707
- Jack Odell took a lot of
his work very personally.

17:08.609 --> 17:12.382
He knew what made a car

17:12.415 --> 17:13.919
special.

17:14.052 --> 17:16.490
It wasn't just the
outline of a car.

17:16.490 --> 17:18.227
The grills looked perfect.

17:18.360 --> 17:20.230
The placement of the speedometer

17:20.363 --> 17:22.300
and the tachometer
inside the vehicle,

17:22.400 --> 17:24.271
where most kids wouldn't
even bother to look,

17:24.404 --> 17:26.375
that was important
to Jack Odell.

17:27.711 --> 17:31.586
These looked like the cars
that Mom and Dad drove,

17:31.652 --> 17:35.325
and that's what really made
Matchbox cars extra special.

17:36.694 --> 17:40.401
- Once Matchbox finally
took off in Great Britain,

17:40.502 --> 17:43.742
they decided, "We should
test other markets."

17:43.742 --> 17:45.546
- Leslie, I'm thinking

17:45.579 --> 17:49.887
maybe we should broaden our
horizons a bit across the pond.

17:50.120 --> 17:51.156
- America?

17:51.255 --> 17:53.527
- Well, there's no reason
why American children

17:53.661 --> 17:55.597
won't fall in love
with Matchbox too,

17:56.999 --> 17:58.870
and the US market is enormous.

17:59.137 --> 18:01.676
- Aren't you worried the quality
will suffer if we ramp up?

18:01.676 --> 18:03.546
- No, not one bit.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.526
- [Narrator] And when
Matchbox launches in the US,

18:10.593 --> 18:13.598
it's the jumpstart Elliot
Handler needs to ignite

18:13.664 --> 18:17.238
one of the biggest business
rivalries of the century.

18:20.077 --> 18:21.346
(pulsing electronic music)

18:21.446 --> 18:24.050
Nearly 10 years before
(a British invasion)

18:24.150 --> 18:27.524
of a different sort,
Matchbox cars make their way

18:27.525 --> 18:28.660
to US shores.

18:30.463 --> 18:33.870
- They're importing something
like 70 million cars

18:34.036 --> 18:36.041
and the kids are loving it.

18:36.173 --> 18:38.512
And it's not just
the British cars now,

18:38.579 --> 18:42.251
because now they're also
producing American-made cars.

18:45.157 --> 18:46.861
- [Man] Can you give
us a couple minutes?

18:47.061 --> 18:47.796
Thanks.

18:50.366 --> 18:52.939
- What's this?
- Our latest sales figures.

18:53.105 --> 18:54.475
You hit your target buddy.

18:54.609 --> 18:56.112
You're a millionaire
by the age of 40.

18:56.178 --> 19:00.319
- (laughing) With a
few days to spare, huh?

19:03.559 --> 19:06.798
- [Narrator] By 1962,
Matchbox pumps out

19:07.065 --> 19:11.674
one million toy cars a week,
more than all the real cars

19:11.774 --> 19:15.214
the world's big
automakers make in a year.

19:16.082 --> 19:16.883
- And now,

19:16.883 --> 19:19.923
not only are they
a hit in Britain,

19:20.090 --> 19:22.028
now they are getting imported.

19:22.094 --> 19:26.168
Kids, dads, everybody
loved the Matchbox cars.

19:26.368 --> 19:27.237
They're affordable.

19:27.370 --> 19:31.679
They're 39 cents each
from 1961 to 1966.

19:33.348 --> 19:35.787
- [Narrator] The drawing
office of a car-producing firm.

19:35.787 --> 19:36.622
Ever since the company started,

19:36.755 --> 19:39.459
more than 250 million
Matchbox models

19:39.627 --> 19:41.698
have come off the assembly line.

19:41.698 --> 19:42.832
The models are perfect in detail

19:43.099 --> 19:46.306
for the most critical collector,
yet fun for the children.

19:48.343 --> 19:50.815
(pensive music)

19:50.815 --> 19:51.583
- [Narrator] One
of those children

19:51.716 --> 19:54.555
is Elliot Handler's
own grandson.

19:54.655 --> 19:57.762
In the years since
Handler's Dream Car failure,

19:57.828 --> 20:02.904
Mattel has taken off, thanks
to a doll called Barbie.

20:03.572 --> 20:06.277
But her success is
driven by Ruth Handler.

20:07.379 --> 20:08.516
- I'm sure his
buddies were going,

20:08.649 --> 20:11.420
"Hey, what are you
gonna come up with?"

20:11.486 --> 20:13.891
And I think that Elliot had
to come up with something

20:14.125 --> 20:18.034
to get somewhere close to
what she had done with Barbie.

20:18.233 --> 20:20.804
(pensive music)

20:23.275 --> 20:24.546
- Hey, kid.

20:24.546 --> 20:26.517
What ya got there?

20:26.517 --> 20:28.118
(car whooshing)

20:28.318 --> 20:29.454
- He owns Mattel,

20:29.521 --> 20:32.727
and his grandson is playing
with somebody else's toy.

20:32.827 --> 20:35.332
And he's thinking to
himself, "What's going on?"

20:37.803 --> 20:40.041
(wheels squeaking)

20:40.141 --> 20:43.749
- "How dare our grandson
be thrilled with a toy

20:43.749 --> 20:45.618
"that Mattel doesn't make."

20:45.618 --> 20:47.087
Elliot didn't like that.

20:47.187 --> 20:50.093
And to the extent that
something triggered

20:50.193 --> 20:53.534
Elliot's competitive
urge, that triggered it.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.438
- Elliot knew from that
standpoint when seeing that

20:56.572 --> 20:58.375
that he could make
a better toy car

20:58.475 --> 21:00.246
than the one his grandson
was playing with.

21:00.412 --> 21:03.919
(pensive percussion music)

21:05.589 --> 21:08.562
(wheels squeaking)

21:12.836 --> 21:14.740
- Is that as fast as it goes?

21:17.545 --> 21:18.515
(Elliot laughing)

21:18.581 --> 21:19.850
- Gotta remember, he
always had this passion

21:19.883 --> 21:23.656
and he had to let it go for
awhile, but it wasn't gone.

21:26.194 --> 21:28.198
This ignited a brand new spark.

21:29.602 --> 21:31.337
- He had lots of opportunity
to just throw in the towel,

21:31.470 --> 21:33.241
but that tenacity that he had

21:33.341 --> 21:35.746
really served
Elliot Handler well,

21:35.880 --> 21:38.619
and he never let go
of his own dream.

21:42.592 --> 21:43.861
- But you can't
seriously be proposing

21:43.861 --> 21:46.166
that we take on Matchbox.

21:46.299 --> 21:48.336
- I am.
- They own the market.

21:49.337 --> 21:52.144
(laughing) They
created the market.

21:52.210 --> 21:55.483
The craftsmanship of
those cars is impeccable.

21:56.485 --> 21:58.354
How could we possibly
improve on it?

22:00.893 --> 22:03.799
(wheels squeaking)

22:05.503 --> 22:07.973
- [Narrator] Jack Ryan, a
trained rocket scientist

22:07.973 --> 22:09.977
and Mattel's chief engineer,

22:10.244 --> 22:13.852
is tapped to create a
miniature toy car for Mattel.

22:14.820 --> 22:17.992
- Jack Ryan said,
"You know we can do it,

22:18.259 --> 22:21.099
"but you really don't wanna
get into that business.

22:21.232 --> 22:22.969
"Matchbox is such a leader.

22:24.371 --> 22:26.074
"It would cost a
lotta money to tool up

22:26.241 --> 22:28.312
"to make this kind of a product.

22:28.478 --> 22:29.314
"Let's not get into it.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.384
"Don't waste your time."

22:31.519 --> 22:33.856
- Don't tell me we
can't design a car

22:33.889 --> 22:38.598
that performs better than that,
that is more fun than that.

22:40.669 --> 22:43.073
- And Elliot said, "No,
we're gonna get into it.

22:43.073 --> 22:45.310
"Come back to me with
a great product."

22:54.795 --> 22:55.697
- Okay.

22:56.933 --> 22:59.872
(rising intense music)

22:59.939 --> 23:02.577
- [Narrator] But can he
improve on Matchbox's

23:02.677 --> 23:05.415
revolutionary
million-dollar design?

23:10.692 --> 23:12.829
(light electronic music)

23:13.731 --> 23:16.036
Co-founder of Mattel
Elliot Handler

23:16.036 --> 23:18.440
had given up on toy cars.

23:18.573 --> 23:22.413
But in 1966, he's
taking one last shot.

23:23.382 --> 23:25.954
(pensive music)

23:27.590 --> 23:30.998
- So, engineers went out and
bought some Matchbox cars

23:30.998 --> 23:31.799
and took 'em apart.

23:35.673 --> 23:37.275
- As soon as they
started rolling

23:37.441 --> 23:39.446
these competitor cars around,

23:39.580 --> 23:42.920
a lot of 'em had a
straight metal axle.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.390
And sure, they would roll,

23:45.456 --> 23:47.629
but you had to have your
hand on it the whole time

23:47.762 --> 23:49.866
if you wanted it
to roll very far.

23:56.579 --> 23:57.681
- [Narrator] The
engineers need a way

23:57.747 --> 24:01.622
to make it more like the
flexible axle of a real car.

24:04.594 --> 24:09.604
- Mattel had thousands of
yards of leftover violin wire

24:10.471 --> 24:11.941
from one of their toy violins.

24:13.042 --> 24:15.848
They took that wire
and started bending it

24:15.915 --> 24:19.689
and allowed the car to make
turns and be much faster.

24:21.358 --> 24:23.697
- And Jack changed the material
of the wheel to delrin,

24:23.796 --> 24:25.934
which was a new
plastic at that time,

24:26.034 --> 24:28.372
which gave it less friction
and more suspension

24:28.472 --> 24:30.475
and, in the end, more speed.

24:32.713 --> 24:35.519
(pensive music)

24:37.657 --> 24:40.695
- [Narrator] Meanwhile, Jack
Odell stays hyper-focused

24:40.762 --> 24:44.435
on the tiny details of
each Matchbox creation.

24:46.740 --> 24:48.210
- Ah.

24:48.375 --> 24:50.112
An Aston-Martin DBR.

24:52.383 --> 24:53.820
You got the wheels wrong here.

24:53.820 --> 24:54.822
They're too small.

24:55.891 --> 24:59.096
Right, they need to be
higher than the frame.

24:59.096 --> 25:02.436
- Matchbox brought authenticity,

25:02.503 --> 25:06.244
and there was a very
strong market for that.

25:06.376 --> 25:08.280
- Lesney's making
these incredible toys.

25:08.413 --> 25:09.917
They're killing
it in the market.

25:09.917 --> 25:10.552
They're selling well.

25:10.719 --> 25:12.155
People really, really love them.

25:12.355 --> 25:13.357
They want more.

25:13.457 --> 25:15.293
They're not even thinking
about competition

25:15.393 --> 25:17.097
brewing all the
way in California.

25:22.708 --> 25:24.377
- [Narrator] After
months of development,

25:24.511 --> 25:26.482
Jack Ryan and the
engineering team

25:26.582 --> 25:29.420
rig up a track to
test their new design.

25:30.657 --> 25:33.862
- This car is a
regular Matchbox.

25:39.439 --> 25:42.011
(car whooshing)

25:43.379 --> 25:47.421
- This (pausing) is
also a Matchbox car,

25:48.724 --> 25:52.430
but we've done some of our
own modifications on it.

25:53.533 --> 25:54.434
Three...

25:55.737 --> 25:57.240
Two...

25:57.406 --> 25:59.946
One.
(car whooshing)

25:59.946 --> 26:02.817
- (laughing) Woo!

26:02.817 --> 26:05.723
(energetic music)

26:06.992 --> 26:08.361
- And then they knew they
had an amazing product

26:08.528 --> 26:09.428
from that day on.

26:13.537 --> 26:16.844
- [Narrator] But a big challenge
is getting it to market.

26:16.977 --> 26:20.350
- What if we hire
a real car designer

26:20.449 --> 26:24.925
from the auto industry:
Chrysler, Ford, GM?

26:28.498 --> 26:31.070
(pensive music)

26:33.441 --> 26:36.479
- Harry Bradley was
a real car designer.

26:37.582 --> 26:40.287
A lot of his
designs were on tour

26:40.287 --> 26:42.158
at car shows all
over the country.

26:44.964 --> 26:46.733
- As they're
developing this car,

26:46.866 --> 26:49.105
Bradley's working on sketches,

26:49.137 --> 26:52.679
trying to determine what the
look of this thing will be,

26:52.745 --> 26:55.182
and he's just having a
very hard time with it.

26:58.154 --> 27:00.392
- Harry, we didn't hire you

27:00.526 --> 27:03.497
just to make toy
cars look better.

27:05.067 --> 27:07.105
I want 'em to look
like the sexiest car

27:07.105 --> 27:09.075
driving down Sunset Strip.

27:09.075 --> 27:11.915
(engine revving)

27:11.948 --> 27:15.755
- [Narrator] Elliot's drawn to
an emerging 1960s car trend.

27:17.057 --> 27:19.629
- Guys were customizing
cars and hot-rodding cars.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.232
If you're in
Southern California,

27:21.232 --> 27:23.168
you're gonna see hot-rods.

27:23.168 --> 27:25.039
- Elliot Handler's idea

27:25.172 --> 27:28.513
was to bring the
California custom culture

27:28.646 --> 27:30.783
to kids all over the world.

27:33.689 --> 27:35.859
- That is what I want.

27:38.632 --> 27:44.843
- Elliot realizes that the look
of this hot-rodded El Camino

27:44.943 --> 27:46.948
is critical to what
they're trying to do here.

27:47.081 --> 27:49.552
They're gonna use
established car designs,

27:49.618 --> 27:52.958
but the look they're gonna
go for is this custom look

27:53.058 --> 27:56.365
that is distinct
from production cars.

27:56.566 --> 27:59.136
(pensive music)

28:00.940 --> 28:01.741
- [Narrator] Handler approves

28:01.875 --> 28:04.012
several of Bradley's
new designs,

28:04.079 --> 28:08.086
including one he considers
his surefire golden ticket.

28:11.092 --> 28:12.763
- Ruthie, you are gonna love it.

28:12.929 --> 28:14.165
- Let's see what you got.

28:21.880 --> 28:22.748
What is that?

28:24.084 --> 28:26.387
I've never even seen a
sports car like that.

28:26.522 --> 28:28.324
- It's the new
Corvette Stingray.

28:28.559 --> 28:32.099
Chevy are doing a total redesign
next year, top to bottom.

28:32.099 --> 28:33.835
- How do you know?

28:33.968 --> 28:36.106
- Harry saw the blueprints.

28:37.609 --> 28:40.516
- Harry Bradley still had
friends at General Motors.

28:40.749 --> 28:45.624
The rumor has it that he got
the plans for the 1968 Corvette

28:45.724 --> 28:49.900
before the '68 Corvette
was at the car dealers.

28:49.999 --> 28:52.436
- And if we get
this to market soon,

28:52.571 --> 28:55.877
our toy car will
beat the real car

28:55.944 --> 28:58.115
before it even rolls
off the assembly line.

28:59.585 --> 29:05.027
- Now, whether that's true
or not, we really don't know.

29:07.298 --> 29:10.671
But the timing of the release
with the '68 Corvette,

29:11.774 --> 29:13.209
they're pretty close.

29:16.784 --> 29:20.356
- [Narrator] Handler names
his new toy Hot Wheels

29:20.356 --> 29:21.893
after the hot-rodded car

29:22.026 --> 29:24.799
driven by his designer,
Harry Bradley.

29:24.899 --> 29:27.904
Bradley designs most of
the first production run,

29:28.037 --> 29:30.609
which they call the Sweet 16.

29:30.709 --> 29:33.381
- The Sweet 16 was a
collection of 16 cars

29:33.381 --> 29:35.820
that were customized
American cars,

29:35.920 --> 29:40.027
plus a handful of
one-off hot-rod type cars

29:40.127 --> 29:43.066
and, in that way,
distinct from Matchbox.

29:43.166 --> 29:45.538
- Each of these
cars had cool names.

29:45.771 --> 29:47.441
Silhouette.

29:47.641 --> 29:48.944
Fleetside.

29:49.044 --> 29:51.850
That was part of the
allure also of Hot Wheels,

29:51.916 --> 29:55.590
and that was different than
the way Matchbox had operated.

29:55.790 --> 29:57.326
They had fire trucks.

29:57.326 --> 29:59.230
They had police cars.

29:59.296 --> 30:01.935
The cars just weren't
exciting as what you would see

30:02.035 --> 30:04.741
the cool teenager down
the street driving.

30:04.907 --> 30:07.045
- It was a new way to play.

30:07.178 --> 30:09.784
They sold track
and carrying cases

30:09.917 --> 30:11.721
and they sold service stations

30:11.821 --> 30:14.491
where you could repair
your Hot Wheels.

30:14.659 --> 30:16.328
They were wild and outlandish.

30:17.632 --> 30:19.068
- [Narrator] Hot Wheels
is slated to debut

30:19.168 --> 30:21.606
at the biggest toy
convention in the world,

30:21.772 --> 30:23.809
Toy Fair in New York City.

30:25.145 --> 30:27.149
- Toy Fair was an event

30:27.249 --> 30:30.656
involving the
manufacturers of toys

30:30.822 --> 30:33.962
and the people who bought toys

30:34.062 --> 30:36.968
as representatives
of department stores.

30:39.706 --> 30:41.376
- [Narrator] But just
as Mattel gets ready

30:41.376 --> 30:43.012
for its big launch-

30:43.981 --> 30:46.118
- [Harry] I'm resigning.

30:46.118 --> 30:47.121
- [Elliot] What?

30:47.221 --> 30:51.929
- Designing toys is fun,
but I design real cars.

30:51.963 --> 30:52.965
That's...

30:54.133 --> 30:55.236
That's just who I am.

30:56.973 --> 30:59.845
- [Narrator] With the
1968 Toy Fair looming,

30:59.978 --> 31:01.982
Elliot Handler must carry on

31:02.115 --> 31:05.222
without the genius
behind his designs.

31:05.255 --> 31:10.097
- The debut at Toy Fair for
Hot Wheels was all-critical.

31:10.230 --> 31:11.967
If they couldn't
interest the buyers,

31:12.134 --> 31:13.772
it was dead in the water.

31:13.938 --> 31:14.873
(rising suspenseful music)

31:18.245 --> 31:19.983
- [Narrator] Elliot
Handler is about to take

31:20.116 --> 31:22.187
the biggest risk of his career:

31:22.287 --> 31:25.091
going up against
industry titan Matchbox

31:25.225 --> 31:27.430
with Mattel's new
Hot Wheels line

31:27.430 --> 31:29.834
of die-cast cars
and accessories.

31:32.005 --> 31:36.748
The first big hurdle is
the 1968 annual Toy Fair.

31:36.881 --> 31:39.419
- Toy Fair was three
to four weeks long

31:39.452 --> 31:43.995
and every single toy buyer in
the country went to Toy Fair.

31:44.127 --> 31:46.132
This is where they
wrote their orders.

31:46.232 --> 31:48.369
That was the place to
make it or break it.

31:49.939 --> 31:52.476
(pensive music)

32:02.796 --> 32:04.634
- [Narrator] But Handler
makes a bold move

32:04.800 --> 32:06.470
to steal an advantage.

32:09.041 --> 32:12.281
As the event approaches, he
jumps the gun on his competitors

32:12.381 --> 32:15.454
by inviting Kmart's
head buyer, Ken Sanger,

32:15.454 --> 32:18.059
to LA for a sneak preview.

32:18.191 --> 32:19.862
- [Ken] What kinda car is this?

32:20.062 --> 32:21.232
- That's a Deora.

32:21.232 --> 32:22.868
It's a concept car.

32:26.942 --> 32:28.110
- How does it perform?

32:33.421 --> 32:36.225
(car whooshing)

32:43.841 --> 32:44.976
We'll take 50.

32:46.378 --> 32:47.280
- Thousand?

32:48.917 --> 32:50.186
- Million.

32:50.186 --> 32:53.059
(energetic music)

32:53.158 --> 32:54.894
- [Narrator] By the
end of the Toy Fair,

32:55.028 --> 32:56.698
retailers from
around the country

32:56.832 --> 32:59.036
put in orders for Hot Wheels.

33:02.409 --> 33:04.279
- They actually feared they
didn't have the ability

33:04.345 --> 33:07.686
to make this many cars and
quickly had to switch production

33:07.786 --> 33:10.124
to Hong Kong to get
that factory to work

33:10.257 --> 33:12.193
besides the American factories.

33:15.233 --> 33:17.237
(knocking on door)

33:17.370 --> 33:18.373
- [Man] Marketing
wants your approval

33:18.373 --> 33:19.809
on the in-store packaging.

33:22.446 --> 33:23.214
- It's not fun.

33:24.483 --> 33:26.856
- Matchbox came
in a cardboard box

33:26.989 --> 33:28.693
and you weren't even guaranteed

33:28.826 --> 33:30.462
what color the car
would be inside

33:30.529 --> 33:33.133
because the box would
actually have to be opened.

33:34.837 --> 33:38.944
- I want the kids to see the
cool car they're gonna get.

33:41.449 --> 33:42.351
- Okay.

33:43.854 --> 33:44.522
- Okay.

33:46.292 --> 33:50.567
- Hot Wheels is sold with this
rad flame off the top of it.

33:50.567 --> 33:52.237
It looks fun, it
looks different,

33:52.403 --> 33:54.307
it's bright, it looks exciting.

33:54.374 --> 33:57.713
Those were things that
Elliot wanted to see happen.

33:57.913 --> 34:00.552
(cars whooshing)

34:02.523 --> 34:05.162
- [Narrator] On May 18th, 1968,

34:05.194 --> 34:09.436
the Sweet 16 make their debut
in stores around the country.

34:09.536 --> 34:11.841
- This is the huge moment
for Elliot Handler.

34:12.007 --> 34:13.678
His first Dream Car was a flop,

34:13.911 --> 34:17.383
and now this is his chance
to have everything he wanted.

34:18.553 --> 34:20.858
I can't imagine the
angst and nervousness

34:21.024 --> 34:22.393
this guy must be going through.

34:26.233 --> 34:29.139
(upbeat music)

34:29.173 --> 34:31.979
- [Narrator] Mattel sells
more than 16 million cars

34:32.145 --> 34:33.614
in the first year.

34:33.614 --> 34:35.686
(cars whooshing)

34:35.919 --> 34:38.792
- They went from a fear that
this thing is not gonna sell

34:38.891 --> 34:42.699
to a fear that, "We do
not have the capacity

34:42.699 --> 34:44.736
"to meet the demand
for this product."

34:44.902 --> 34:46.338
They really had to scramble

34:46.405 --> 34:50.280
to try to respond to the
market's fever for Hot Wheels.

34:50.346 --> 34:53.552
- [Narrator] And there's
only room for one at the top.

34:55.523 --> 34:57.628
- Matchbox had to
really scramble.

34:57.628 --> 34:59.564
Sales went way down.

34:59.631 --> 35:03.303
- They weren't prepared
for this new competitor

35:03.337 --> 35:07.212
to be so overwhelming,
not just share the market,

35:07.311 --> 35:10.250
but dominate the market
in a single year.

35:11.620 --> 35:15.026
- [Narrator] By 1969,
Matchbox is in trouble.

35:15.661 --> 35:17.865
- To add insult to injury,

35:17.964 --> 35:20.035
Hot Wheels becomes a
huge hit in Britain

35:20.102 --> 35:23.309
and actually won the UK
Toy of the Year award.

35:23.408 --> 35:25.581
- We're gonna have to
close another factory.

35:25.581 --> 35:26.616
- No, no, no, we can't do that.

35:26.682 --> 35:28.317
We have to think of the
families that depend on us.

35:28.484 --> 35:29.587
- Jack, we could go bankrupt.

35:29.654 --> 35:31.824
- What, so you just wanna
go down without a fight?

35:31.958 --> 35:33.127
Is that your plan?!
- No, Jack,

35:33.294 --> 35:34.697
we learn from Hot Wheels.

35:35.932 --> 35:38.403
We make our cars
faster, flashy colors,

35:38.403 --> 35:39.239
maybe build a racetrack.

35:39.338 --> 35:41.877
- No, no, no, no,
this is not our brand.

35:41.977 --> 35:43.815
We make cars that
people actually own

35:43.948 --> 35:45.283
and see in their real lives,

35:45.416 --> 35:47.554
not these ridiculous-
- Toys?

35:50.126 --> 35:51.529
Jack, we don't have a choice.

35:53.600 --> 35:56.605
- Matchbox did not
see Hot Wheels coming.

35:56.671 --> 36:00.345
And Lesney, these guys,
they now had problems.

36:06.991 --> 36:08.326
(energetic electronic music)

36:08.393 --> 36:11.266
- [Narrator] By 1970, just
two years after the release

36:11.366 --> 36:14.138
of Hot Wheels'
signature Sweet 16,

36:14.237 --> 36:17.512
demand for the toy cars
exceeds the supply.

36:17.512 --> 36:18.614
- [Man] Sold out.

36:18.680 --> 36:20.884
They wanna know when we can
get them a new shipment.

36:20.983 --> 36:22.386
- Well, you know what
you should tell them?

36:22.520 --> 36:25.727
- What?
- Tell 'em to get in line.

36:25.727 --> 36:27.462
(car whooshing)

36:27.530 --> 36:30.334
- [Narrator] Elliot handler
finally has a bonafide hit

36:30.434 --> 36:33.140
to rival his wife
Ruth's Barbie doll.

36:33.240 --> 36:35.512
- I think they were
very supportive couple

36:35.612 --> 36:38.685
and I believe the way
they worked together

36:38.718 --> 36:42.525
as a husband and wife, they
needed to support each other.

36:42.592 --> 36:46.232
But I will tell you this:
Nobody thought Hot Wheels

36:46.332 --> 36:49.036
would become that
successful as they became.

36:50.507 --> 36:51.743
(pensive music)

36:51.976 --> 36:55.349
- [Narrator] Especially the men
behind rival brand Matchbox,

36:55.382 --> 36:59.022
who now make a desperate move
to replicate their competition

36:59.122 --> 37:02.362
with a new line of
cars called Superfast.

37:02.495 --> 37:04.433
- They were building
racing sets.

37:04.567 --> 37:06.002
They were building
carrying cases.

37:06.102 --> 37:08.006
They were trying to
do all of the things

37:08.139 --> 37:10.410
that Mattel had in
the marketplace.

37:10.578 --> 37:13.851
But it was in a following mode

37:14.084 --> 37:17.323
rather than a leadership mode,
and I think that hurt them.

37:18.292 --> 37:20.096
- The Superfast cars

37:20.196 --> 37:22.768
are basically emulating
the Hot Wheels.

37:22.768 --> 37:24.470
They're less realistic.

37:24.571 --> 37:27.375
Frankly, they're
mass-marketed toys.

37:28.712 --> 37:29.814
(bittersweet music)

37:30.081 --> 37:33.287
- [Narrator] For Jack Odell,
the compromise on realism

37:33.353 --> 37:37.762
is the end of the road
and he retires in 1973.

37:40.768 --> 37:43.138
- Rode that steamroller of
yours quite a long way, buddy.

37:43.339 --> 37:44.809
(Jack chuckling)

37:44.809 --> 37:46.178
- [Jack] Yeah.

38:06.483 --> 38:07.920
- [Narrator] Over
the next few years,

38:08.086 --> 38:10.323
Matchbox regains some ground,

38:10.423 --> 38:13.664
but Hot Wheels stays
number one in sales.

38:13.730 --> 38:16.670
- By that time, it was kind
of a little bit too late

38:16.670 --> 38:17.905
for Matchbox.

38:18.071 --> 38:19.642
- They weren't super fast.

38:19.642 --> 38:21.144
There were still slow.

38:21.244 --> 38:23.315
Matchbox just did not
have that playability,

38:23.448 --> 38:25.052
as Mr. Handler would say.

38:26.254 --> 38:29.426
- As the '70s start to wind on,

38:29.560 --> 38:31.898
Matchbox is in
financial trouble.

38:32.098 --> 38:33.501
Part of their difficulty

38:33.602 --> 38:36.272
is that they're making
the toys in England.

38:36.405 --> 38:38.811
The economy is so
bad in Britain.

38:38.811 --> 38:41.249
We're looking at 25% inflation,

38:41.382 --> 38:43.588
not going on in
the United States.

38:43.588 --> 38:44.989
It takes them down.

38:45.189 --> 38:47.761
(pensive music)

38:49.598 --> 38:52.337
- [Narrator] By 1981, on
the brink of collapse,

38:52.403 --> 38:56.143
the company looks to the
past to save the future.

38:59.383 --> 39:01.688
- [Man] Sorry to pull
you off the golf course.

39:03.156 --> 39:05.227
- [Narrator] But the headwinds
pushing against Matchbox

39:05.427 --> 39:06.597
are too strong.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.404
- I feel like I've been summoned

39:10.437 --> 39:15.479
to take charge of the Titanic
10 minutes before she sinks.

39:18.218 --> 39:22.392
- [Narrator] And in 1982,
Lesney Products goes bankrupt.

39:25.332 --> 39:31.143
- If I were to try to coin
some general explanation

39:31.276 --> 39:36.988
for how Mattel displaced
the Matchbox Car

39:37.154 --> 39:39.225
as the number-one die-cast car,

39:39.291 --> 39:43.867
I think I would say that
Mattel out-childed them.

39:43.867 --> 39:46.573
(children playing)

39:46.706 --> 39:48.309
And then when those
children grew up,

39:48.441 --> 39:50.680
they were so struck
by the experience,

39:50.780 --> 39:53.151
they started buying
toys for their kids

39:53.318 --> 39:55.222
and the generation continued.

39:57.760 --> 39:59.664
- [Narrator] Control
of the Matchbox brand

39:59.730 --> 40:04.406
passes through various hands
before finally selling in 1997

40:04.507 --> 40:07.444
to the company that
still owns it today.

40:07.612 --> 40:10.719
- Mattel buys Matchbox.

40:10.751 --> 40:11.620
Wow.

40:12.889 --> 40:14.058
Even to this day,

40:14.158 --> 40:17.430
there are people who
can't get their heads

40:17.531 --> 40:21.405
around the idea that
Mattel owns Matchbox.

40:21.438 --> 40:23.909
Unless they see it in print,
they'll argue with you over it.

40:24.209 --> 40:26.848
They'll say, "No, Matchbox
is made in England."

40:26.915 --> 40:30.956
- At the beginning of
this, Mattel brings it in

40:31.223 --> 40:35.464
and they start to kinda
hot-rod up the Matchbox cars.

40:35.531 --> 40:38.705
And when they do, the
dollars start going away,

40:38.804 --> 40:41.376
Mattel knows right away
they made a mistake.

40:41.476 --> 40:44.014
- They bring in an
entirely different team

40:44.180 --> 40:47.020
to work on Matchbox only.

40:47.186 --> 40:48.322
They go back to the core.

40:48.389 --> 40:51.628
They go back to those vehicles
that are exact replicas,

40:51.762 --> 40:55.169
and once again
Matchbox is a success.

40:55.235 --> 40:59.176
- [Narrator] In 2018, 50
years after its debut,

40:59.243 --> 41:02.849
Hot Wheels is named the
world's top selling toy,

41:02.916 --> 41:07.425
with an average of 10 Hot
Wheels cars sold every second.

41:08.627 --> 41:12.668
- Hot Wheels said, "There's
the wild, crazy world

41:12.668 --> 41:13.737
"of the child.

41:13.804 --> 41:17.611
"The child's toy doesn't
obey the laws of physics.

41:17.710 --> 41:20.617
"The child's toy can
drive into the future."

41:20.683 --> 41:25.760
Mattel has always chased
the child's imagination

41:27.696 --> 41:29.366
and tried to create

41:29.466 --> 41:32.706
with that boundless
energy and inspiration.

41:33.842 --> 41:35.845
(cars whooshing)

41:35.945 --> 41:40.487
- You have car designers,
you have car builders.

41:40.588 --> 41:46.566
These cars have influenced
so many children

41:46.665 --> 41:48.569
to become what
they've become today.

41:50.272 --> 41:52.644
It is the toy that
has built America.

41:57.018 --> 42:00.522
(cars whooshing)
