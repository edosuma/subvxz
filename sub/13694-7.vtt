WEBVTT

00:10.221 --> 00:11.431
(DOOR CLOSING)

00:25.862 --> 00:29.365
-You're off early.
-Yeah, stuff to do.

00:29.449 --> 00:31.117
-Is there anything I can...
-(ENGINE STARTS)

00:47.175 --> 00:50.053
The Lagganmore is a king
among Scotch whiskies.

00:50.136 --> 00:52.764
Your father will be
turning in his grave.

00:52.847 --> 00:54.182
From what little
I remember of him

00:54.265 --> 00:56.267
he was usually too drunk
to turn in his own bed.

00:56.351 --> 00:58.478
You come back
after all these years,

00:58.561 --> 00:59.771
knowing nothing about the job.

00:59.854 --> 01:01.856
AMANDA: But, I can do
simple subtraction.

01:01.939 --> 01:04.858
The rate we're losing money,
we'll be out of business
in weeks.

01:11.616 --> 01:13.284
So, who's with me
when it comes to the vote?

01:17.955 --> 01:20.917
Against?

01:21.000 --> 01:23.127
Looks like our late-running
laird has the casting vote.

01:25.254 --> 01:30.051
No son of Hector Macdonald
will countenance
such sacrilege.

01:30.134 --> 01:32.845
Morning. Lexie Macdonald.

01:32.929 --> 01:34.055
And how are we all?

02:14.470 --> 02:17.765
Okay, so I'll just have
a look over these proposals
and I'll get back to you.

02:17.849 --> 02:19.933
I was hoping to have
this resolved by now.

02:20.018 --> 02:22.770
I mean, every day that passes,
we're deeper in the mire.

02:22.854 --> 02:26.607
Amanda, I am not gonna be
pushed into a decision which
affects people's livelihoods.

02:26.691 --> 02:28.401
Hear hear!

02:28.484 --> 02:29.986
Nor will I see a decent
business run into
the ground through

02:30.069 --> 02:31.988
prehistoric working practices.

02:51.214 --> 02:53.426
Dad, this place!

02:55.803 --> 02:56.929
(SIGHS)

02:58.014 --> 02:59.474
What's wrong?

03:05.355 --> 03:07.774
Uh, I'm starting
the new plantation today.

03:11.569 --> 03:13.404
Good for you.

03:13.488 --> 03:16.532
Are you not going to help?
You know the estate
better than anyone.

03:16.616 --> 03:18.701
(SIGHS) It's just a few trees,
Jessica.

03:18.785 --> 03:20.578
Have some confidence
in yourself.

03:22.747 --> 03:25.458
Andrew wants me
to keep an eye on his cottage.

03:25.541 --> 03:27.543
He's moving
into the big house today.

03:27.627 --> 03:29.045
(DOOR OPENS)

03:31.880 --> 03:34.592
I thought the cellar
was a bit bare.
I hope you don't mind.

03:34.676 --> 03:37.637
(CHUCKLES) I'm sure
we'll think of something
to do with it.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.097
(SIGHS)

03:39.179 --> 03:41.182
The Lagganmore.
Hector's favourite.

03:41.264 --> 03:44.477
Do you remember
when he gave tasting courses
for the tourists?

03:44.560 --> 03:49.315
(IMITATING) I say...
Fine colour, excellent legs.
(SNIFFING)

03:49.399 --> 03:51.275
-Hints of vanilla.
-(LAUGHING)

03:51.359 --> 03:54.487
Far too good
for riff-raff like you!

03:54.570 --> 03:57.573
-Uh! What's all this?
-ANDREW: It's the new
Lagganmore.

03:57.657 --> 03:59.992
(CHUCKLES) Oh, well.

04:00.076 --> 04:02.912
Looks like I'm going to have
to pull out all the stops
in the kitchen tonight.

04:02.995 --> 04:04.455
Uh-huh.

04:04.539 --> 04:06.582
All right, shall we get this
lot down the cellar, then?

04:06.666 --> 04:10.753
Actually, I should be out
on the plantation helping
Jess, so I'll...

04:10.837 --> 04:14.298
We'll open a bottle tonight,
so you can see what
all the fuss is about.

04:14.382 --> 04:16.134
Yeah, okay.

04:17.969 --> 04:20.762
Do you know,
it still hasn't quite sunk in.

04:20.846 --> 04:23.975
I'm about to marry
the most beautiful
woman in Scotland.

04:24.058 --> 04:27.477
And I finally pulled a bloke
with a motorbike!
(CHUCKLES)

04:32.066 --> 04:37.363
We may be outnumbered,
but, er...
The females haven't won yet.

04:37.447 --> 04:42.368
The young Archibald Macdonald
has a brother, I understand.

04:42.452 --> 04:46.289
Born out of wedlock,
but a Macdonald for all that.
And a male.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.085
(DOOR OPENS)

04:52.252 --> 04:54.130
(SIGHS) Everything all right?

04:54.213 --> 04:55.715
(SIGHS)
Yeah, all quiet for once.

04:55.798 --> 04:57.800
No booking at the outdoor
centre for a couple of days.

04:57.884 --> 04:59.218
Oh! Lucky you.

04:59.302 --> 05:01.137
Having a clear out?

05:01.220 --> 05:04.557
No, no, just a sort out.
I'm sure this'll all come
in handy some day.

05:04.640 --> 05:07.393
-So, what can I do?
-Not much going on.

05:08.935 --> 05:10.855
I can help, you know.

05:10.938 --> 05:12.315
-Uh-huh.
-(PAUL CHUCKLES)

05:12.398 --> 05:14.567
Unless you insist
on doing everything
by yourself.

05:14.650 --> 05:17.737
-Like I said, there's not...
-Not much going on.

05:17.820 --> 05:19.864
What about this morning?

05:19.947 --> 05:22.283
-Why the suit?
-Uh, that was a board meeting.

05:22.367 --> 05:25.870
Just a local business
we've got an interest in.

05:25.953 --> 05:30.458
-And?
-And I have to pay some bills
down at the village.

05:30.541 --> 05:33.252
Oh, actually,
if you've got a minute,

05:33.336 --> 05:36.005
could you ring through
that butcher's order for me?

05:36.714 --> 05:37.840
Thank you.

05:40.134 --> 05:41.135
(DOOR CLOSING)

05:43.805 --> 05:48.267
Oh, Andrew,
they are beautiful!

05:48.351 --> 05:51.479
You shouldn't have! (CHUCKLES)

05:51.562 --> 05:54.607
You deserve to be surrounded
by colour and beauty.

05:54.691 --> 05:56.567
From now on it's my mission
to make sure you are.

05:56.651 --> 06:00.822
-I expect you say that to
all the widows.
-Why do you say that?

06:00.905 --> 06:05.868
Oh! Andrew, your mission from
now on is to understand
my childish sense of humour!

06:05.952 --> 06:07.495
-(CHUCKLES)
-(KISSES)

06:25.430 --> 06:26.889
JESS: Maybe it's me.

06:26.973 --> 06:29.017
I'm getting under his feet.

06:29.100 --> 06:32.562
No! Golly loves
having you at the croft.

06:32.645 --> 06:37.483
Yes, he might miss his
independence, though.
I know I do sometimes.

06:37.567 --> 06:42.363
Well, perhaps you could look
for a place on your own.
I mean...

06:42.447 --> 06:45.033
-I could help you.
-JESS: Yeah, a big step.

06:46.492 --> 06:47.952
Ah! I don't mind.

06:48.036 --> 06:49.662
For me. Hello?

06:50.580 --> 06:52.415
JESS: Well...

06:52.498 --> 06:55.501
-I guess I'm not wedded
to Glenbogle.
-I'm glad to hear it.

06:56.377 --> 06:58.046
Guy.

06:58.129 --> 07:00.131
JESS: Uh...
What are you doing here?

07:00.214 --> 07:01.841
I came to see you.

07:01.924 --> 07:04.552
-All this way?
-Yeah.

07:04.635 --> 07:07.804
Me and Julie finally
bit the dust.
Fancied a bit of a break.

07:07.889 --> 07:10.308
Right, I'm sorry. (LAUGHING)

07:13.978 --> 07:15.438
Duncan McKay.

07:16.439 --> 07:17.648
Head ranger.

07:17.732 --> 07:19.859
GUY: Me and Jess were
on the same course.

07:19.942 --> 07:21.611
Ah, so you're in the business?

07:21.694 --> 07:24.530
Missed too many lectures.
Too much else going on.

07:26.449 --> 07:27.950
On with the show,
then, Jessica?

07:28.034 --> 07:30.370
-Yeah.
-Jessica now, very grown-up!

07:30.453 --> 07:31.788
-(LAUGHING)
-I'll give you a hand.

07:31.871 --> 07:33.206
No, we're fine.

07:33.289 --> 07:35.375
I promise not to
get them upside-down.

07:35.458 --> 07:36.959
JESS: Come on then, let's go.

07:38.586 --> 07:40.254
I need a bit of a favour
in return.

07:42.256 --> 07:43.591
You're back.

07:43.675 --> 07:44.967
Did you order any flowers?

07:45.385 --> 07:47.011
No.

07:47.095 --> 07:49.847
We've just had
the gross national product
of Holland delivered.

07:50.473 --> 07:52.016
Show me.

07:52.100 --> 07:53.768
Must be Molly.

07:53.851 --> 07:57.730
You know, I have not seen her
this happy since...

07:59.065 --> 08:00.817
Well, for a while, anyway.

08:02.902 --> 08:04.612
Has any meat arrived yet?

08:04.696 --> 08:07.615
No, I'll go and collect it
now you're back
with the pick-up.

08:07.699 --> 08:09.450
No need.

08:09.534 --> 08:11.786
Having stuff delivered
by some bloke
in a stripy apron

08:11.869 --> 08:14.038
is a bit Gosford Park,
isn't it?

08:14.122 --> 08:15.832
(SCOFFS)
Well, it's the way we do it.

08:15.915 --> 08:19.335
Well, maybe we should
do it differently.

08:19.419 --> 08:23.548
-Progress, eh? Modernisation.
-PAUL: Can't harm.

08:23.631 --> 08:25.967
Well, tell that to the bloke
in the stripy apron

08:26.050 --> 08:28.052
when he's out of a job
and his family's hungry.

08:47.321 --> 08:49.949
(SIGHS)

08:50.033 --> 08:53.953
-Beautiful, isn't it?
-Yeah, it's turned out to be
quite a nice day.

08:54.871 --> 08:56.456
Got nothing planned?

08:56.539 --> 08:59.459
Well, Andrew wanted me
to climb Ben Bogle,

08:59.542 --> 09:01.294
but I managed to
wriggle out of it.

09:01.377 --> 09:04.339
My Munro-bagging
days are over.
(LAUGHING)

09:04.422 --> 09:07.592
-LEXIE: Never!
-And good riddance.
(SIGHS)

09:07.675 --> 09:13.514
Another small line crossed out
of the Book of Life.
But love... (LAUGHING)

09:13.598 --> 09:16.642
I thought that had
been crossed out, too.

09:16.726 --> 09:20.855
Look, I am so happy
for you, Molly.
Let me see it.

09:24.275 --> 09:25.318
(SOFTLY) I'm scared.

09:26.778 --> 09:28.571
I know so little about him.

09:30.031 --> 09:33.743
Well, he's charming
and he's pretty cute.

09:33.826 --> 09:37.121
-(LAUGHING)
-And he is obviously loaded.

09:37.997 --> 09:39.791
It's an heirloom.

09:39.874 --> 09:43.419
Andrew's father
brought it back
from India after the war.

09:43.503 --> 09:47.173
He carried it next to
his heart all through
the Burma Campaign,

09:47.256 --> 09:50.885
and he proposed to
Andrew's mother
on his first day home.

09:50.968 --> 09:54.806
Nobody's ever worn it
except Andrew's mother...
And me.

09:59.227 --> 10:01.104
Oh, listen to me...
"Me, me, me, me, me!"

10:01.187 --> 10:02.855
(LAUGHING)

10:02.939 --> 10:04.565
So, what is it you wanted?

10:05.942 --> 10:08.236
Oh, no, it's nothing.

10:08.319 --> 10:12.699
Oh, Lexie, you have
so much to do
with Archie away. What was it?

10:14.075 --> 10:17.495
(SIGHS) Well, it's just to
avoid any confusion,

10:17.578 --> 10:20.373
could you make sure
that all the orders
come through me?

10:20.456 --> 10:24.460
Well, of course, obviously.
What... What orders?

10:24.544 --> 10:27.714
(SIGHS) A very large
consignment of flowers.

10:27.797 --> 10:30.258
(CHUCKLES)
They were a gift from Andrew.

10:31.050 --> 10:32.719
Oh.

10:32.802 --> 10:35.304
But they were invoiced
to the Glenbogle estate.

10:35.388 --> 10:37.515
You can't think
he wasn't going
to pay for them!

10:37.598 --> 10:39.976
No, no, I mean,
that never crossed my mind.

10:40.059 --> 10:43.438
-Obviously a mistake
by the florist.
-Yeah, yeah.

10:45.356 --> 10:46.941
I'll ask him to
give you a cheque.

10:48.359 --> 10:49.569
No. No, no, no,
you don't have to.

10:50.570 --> 10:51.904
No bother.

11:00.455 --> 11:02.999
Would you be the bastard son
of Hector Macdonald?

11:06.169 --> 11:07.879
That's one way of putting it.

11:07.962 --> 11:11.591
Gregor McIntosh,
head distiller
at The Lagganmore.

11:13.634 --> 11:16.429
Now, where have I heard
that name?

11:16.512 --> 11:21.768
Ah! Producers of the finest
12-year-old malt since 1850.

11:21.851 --> 11:23.978
My father's favourite.

11:24.062 --> 11:29.484
Right enough. Rest his soul.

11:29.567 --> 11:33.696
I just thank the Lord that
he's been spared knowledge
of the latest development.

11:36.491 --> 11:39.911
Now the place is to be run
by a female.

11:39.994 --> 11:42.538
(SCOFFS) It happens.

11:42.622 --> 11:46.167
The former owner's daughter,
a mere slip of a girl,
of no experience,

11:46.250 --> 11:52.423
who now seeks to form
a powder-puff alliance with
the young Macdonald female.

11:52.507 --> 11:57.345
-Lexie?
-Who this morning claimed
to speak for the laird

11:57.428 --> 11:59.597
on the flimsy
pretext of marriage.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.600
What's her interest
in the company?

12:02.684 --> 12:06.354
Your father was on the board.
She now fills your seat.

12:06.437 --> 12:09.065
Which has
always been a male preserve.

12:09.148 --> 12:11.317
Archie left her
a pretty free hand.

12:11.401 --> 12:16.322
To turn us into a factory
feeding greed with a base
and unpalatable product?

12:16.406 --> 12:17.907
Argue your case.

12:17.990 --> 12:23.496
I've tried,
but we speak completely
different languages.

12:23.579 --> 12:25.915
You, on the other hand,
will understand.

12:25.998 --> 12:27.417
(SCOFFS) You think so?

12:27.500 --> 12:31.462
The Lagganmore coursed through
your father's veins

12:31.546 --> 12:33.506
almost untainted by

12:33.589 --> 12:35.425
blood or other
such impurities.

12:37.010 --> 12:38.636
You are his son,

12:38.720 --> 12:39.846
are you not?

12:54.193 --> 12:56.362
-(DOOR OPENS)

13:07.790 --> 13:10.793
Golly, where have you
been hiding yourself?

13:10.877 --> 13:12.670
(SIGHS) I haven't been hiding.

13:12.754 --> 13:15.965
Come in, come in.

13:16.049 --> 13:19.344
-You look a bit pale.
Are you all right?
-I'm well enough.

13:19.427 --> 13:22.555
-Good to see that you are.
-(CHUCKLES) Never better.

13:22.638 --> 13:25.767
Um...
What do you think of this?

13:25.850 --> 13:28.603
(SIGHS) I'm no judge
of material, Molly,

13:30.104 --> 13:32.607
but I'm a fair judge of a man.

13:32.690 --> 13:34.567
Don't be inscrutable, Golly,
it's too early.

13:34.650 --> 13:37.904
Andrew, Molly. Andrew.
I just hope he's the man
you take him for...

13:37.987 --> 13:39.197
Golly, please!

13:39.280 --> 13:40.782
-But I fear he may not be.
-That is enough.

13:40.865 --> 13:42.909
I've tried to stand back,
I've tried. But I can't.

13:42.992 --> 13:44.911
Well, then try
a little harder.

13:44.994 --> 13:47.455
I'm worried that you're making
a terrible mistake.

13:48.664 --> 13:50.208
What do you base that on?

13:50.833 --> 13:51.834
Instinct.

13:53.169 --> 13:54.671
(INHALES)

13:54.754 --> 13:57.590
I trust your instincts in all
matters regarding the estate,

13:57.674 --> 13:59.717
but in this matter
you must trust mine.

14:00.760 --> 14:03.346
Well... It's not just...

14:03.429 --> 14:04.889
Oh!

14:04.972 --> 14:07.392
Not taking this man's advice
on curtaining are you, Molly?

14:07.475 --> 14:09.477
Well, er...

14:09.560 --> 14:11.854
Golly says that he's no judge.

14:13.439 --> 14:15.316
I'll leave you
to your decorating.

14:18.611 --> 14:22.448
Strange bloke.
"Hewn from the rock of his
native land," comes to mind.

14:23.199 --> 14:25.034
Yes, yes he is a rock.

14:25.118 --> 14:27.453
-So, what did you choose?
-Well, I thought this one.

14:27.537 --> 14:29.622
Oh! Perfect.

14:29.706 --> 14:32.792
GUY: So, by this time,
nobody's got a stitch on
except me and Jess.

14:32.875 --> 14:34.585
She's down to her
bra and panties

14:34.669 --> 14:37.130
and I'm freezing my
wee fella off in my boxers
and one sock!

14:37.213 --> 14:39.048
-Have another sarnie!
-(CHUCKLES)

14:42.343 --> 14:44.429
I've got three jacks.
So I'm quietly confident...

14:44.512 --> 14:46.139
You know, I don't think
Duncan needs to hear this.

14:46.222 --> 14:48.266
No, no. I mean...

14:48.349 --> 14:52.353
-It's interesting.
-So, have you sorted out
anywhere to stay yet?

14:52.437 --> 14:55.565
Nah. That was the favour.

14:55.648 --> 14:59.152
-I'm a bit short of readies
until I can cash a giro.
-Uh...

14:59.235 --> 15:04.157
-Well, I'll see what Dad says.
-Ah! It's awful wee,
your dad's croft.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.242
We don't mind that, do we?

15:06.325 --> 15:08.369
Well, it's just, I don't know
if he's in the mood
for visitors,

15:08.453 --> 15:10.496
you know,
from what you said.

15:10.580 --> 15:13.249
He wouldn't turn an old buddy
of his daughter's away?

15:13.332 --> 15:15.626
Well, yeah,
I'll see what Dad says.

15:19.339 --> 15:20.673
(WATER RUNNING)

15:23.134 --> 15:27.180
The local minister,
when it came to baptising
his first grandchild,

15:27.263 --> 15:29.640
drew the water from this burn.

15:29.724 --> 15:33.353
He reckoned, if it had to be
holy water, it might as well
be proper holy water.

15:33.436 --> 15:36.022
And this is what ends up
in the Lagganmore?

15:38.024 --> 15:40.526
Fourteen employees,
hell of a wage bill.

15:40.610 --> 15:42.111
Couldn't you get by on less?

15:42.195 --> 15:46.157
Barley comes from
a neighbour's farm.
In here are the steeps.

15:46.240 --> 15:50.453
Then the malting floor
where it's spread and turned
by hand for 12 days.

15:50.536 --> 15:52.455
Can't you get machines
to do that?

15:54.332 --> 15:58.127
Next, it's dried
over peat fires
and ground by water power,

15:58.211 --> 16:02.507
then into the mash ton,
where our beautiful burn
turns it into the wort.

16:02.590 --> 16:04.217
It's a long process.

16:04.300 --> 16:07.345
Then into the copper stills
to be twice-distilled,
and finally

16:08.054 --> 16:09.681
into cask.

16:09.764 --> 16:11.474
Not done yet, then?

16:11.557 --> 16:14.686
Three weeks, give or take.

16:14.769 --> 16:17.855
Then 12 years in oak
before we let you
buggers drink it.

16:35.123 --> 16:36.791
(INHALES DEEPLY)

16:39.627 --> 16:42.755
There. Enjoy, young man...

16:42.839 --> 16:48.177
As your father did before you
and your children will long
after you're dead and gone.

16:49.887 --> 16:51.931
God willing. (SNIFFING)

16:54.267 --> 16:56.561
It's, er...a bit early for me.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.942
ANDREW: So,
there's a new partition
wall here and here.

17:03.026 --> 17:05.444
And a new doorway there,
leading between
those two rooms.

17:05.528 --> 17:07.070
-Mmm-hmm.
-Oh!

17:07.155 --> 17:08.698
-Sorry.
-No, Lexie, wait.

17:11.909 --> 17:15.788
I've signed it. Would you mind
filling in the figures for me?

17:15.872 --> 17:19.876
I'm sorry about the confusion,
and that Molly was troubled.

17:19.959 --> 17:22.337
No, that's okay. Listen,
I'll come back later...

17:22.420 --> 17:23.880
No, no, you need to see this.
Come here.

17:25.631 --> 17:27.425
It's just an idea.

17:30.178 --> 17:32.472
ANDREW: So that Molly
and I will have
our own wing at the house.

17:33.306 --> 17:36.225
Right, um... Well...

17:36.309 --> 17:38.269
Is that a kitchen? Upstairs?

17:38.353 --> 17:40.355
Now, I won't have
any sexist remarks.

17:40.438 --> 17:42.065
I'm actually quite
a good cook.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.858
Yeah, I'm sure you are.

17:43.941 --> 17:46.151
We'll still eat together.

17:46.235 --> 17:48.321
ANDREW: Of course, weekends.

17:48.404 --> 17:51.783
You see, the house should
serve the way we live,
not the other way round.

17:51.865 --> 17:54.493
Of course.
If that's what you want,
Molly?

17:55.995 --> 17:56.996
Yes.

17:59.414 --> 18:01.167
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

18:02.126 --> 18:03.627
Amanda!

18:03.711 --> 18:06.755
This here is a true
blood descendant
of Hector Macdonald.

18:07.298 --> 18:08.466
Really?

18:08.548 --> 18:10.635
The male line
is now represented.

18:11.469 --> 18:13.054
Amanda MacLeish.

18:14.138 --> 18:16.182
-Delighted.
-How do you do?

18:23.106 --> 18:27.276
This place doesn't have
the muscle to compete
with the big brands.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.987
And the working practices
are archaic.

18:30.071 --> 18:32.407
Well, you could say that
about any hand-made product.

18:32.490 --> 18:34.867
There's a long tradition here,
and that's important
to people.

18:34.951 --> 18:36.869
I respect tradition.

18:36.953 --> 18:40.415
But not when
it's an excuse to let things
drift towards the abyss.

18:40.498 --> 18:44.919
The staffing levels here make
Man United look like
the corner shop.

18:45.003 --> 18:47.213
It's a labour-intensive
process.

18:48.881 --> 18:51.968
-Gregor's done a job on you!
-I make up my own mind.

18:52.051 --> 18:53.344
On half a tale?

18:54.429 --> 18:56.973
Must be a man thing.

18:57.056 --> 19:00.852
Okay.
You tell me this place
is on its last legs,

19:00.935 --> 19:02.603
but I don't see the evidence.

19:02.687 --> 19:04.313
-I have it.
-So show me.

19:05.565 --> 19:06.607
Have dinner with me.

19:08.151 --> 19:09.777
-What?
-Tonight.

19:09.861 --> 19:11.571
I'll show you the figures.
You be the judge.

19:13.239 --> 19:16.951
Lexie's across this already.

19:17.035 --> 19:20.079
That doesn't stop you from
taking an interest, does it?

19:30.006 --> 19:31.090
Dad?

19:32.717 --> 19:35.303
Jess. How are the trees?

19:36.262 --> 19:37.764
What brought this on?

19:37.847 --> 19:40.975
I come from a long line
of social drinkers.

19:41.059 --> 19:42.727
Your mother no doubt told you.

19:44.645 --> 19:46.689
Is it me?

19:46.773 --> 19:49.233
You're the one bright spark
in the whole sky.

19:50.735 --> 19:52.028
(CLICKS TONGUE)

19:52.111 --> 19:53.696
What is it you wanted?

19:53.780 --> 19:55.448
Nothing.

19:55.531 --> 19:57.575
You didn't break off
your work just for nothing.

19:57.658 --> 20:00.036
No, I just wanted to see
that you were okay.

20:01.579 --> 20:04.624
Well, you don't worry
about me, Jess.

20:04.707 --> 20:09.295
You just carry on
with your own day
and I'll carry on with mine.

20:17.512 --> 20:22.600
Listen, I couldn't say this
in front of Jess,
but, well, her dad...

20:22.684 --> 20:26.187
-Bit scary?
-Well, he's always
been okay with me,

20:26.270 --> 20:27.855
but, well,

20:27.939 --> 20:29.982
I keep out of his way
after dark.

20:30.066 --> 20:31.484
You really don't want me here,
do you?

20:33.236 --> 20:35.738
Doesn't matter to me.

20:35.822 --> 20:39.242
Look, I missed out big time
with Jess at college.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.244
Eye off the ball
at the wrong moment.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.037
I won't make
that mistake again,

20:43.871 --> 20:45.289
unless you two are...

20:45.373 --> 20:47.500
-No, we're not.
-Good.

20:47.583 --> 20:49.502
I've got a clear run, then.

20:50.169 --> 20:51.671
Hey.

20:51.754 --> 20:54.215
He's really sorry,
it's just not
convenient tonight.

20:54.298 --> 20:57.301
Well, look, thanks for trying.

20:57.385 --> 21:00.388
I'll just, you know curl up
in a hollow somewhere.

21:00.471 --> 21:02.265
(LAUGHING) You can't do that.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.559
Actually, the weather
forecast's not that bad.

21:04.642 --> 21:07.311
I hope you wouldn't treat
a friend of yours like that.

21:07.395 --> 21:09.814
Not to worry,
it would have been a laugh,
that's all.

21:09.897 --> 21:11.024
Catching up.

21:11.107 --> 21:12.567
Yeah, still can't be helped.

21:13.943 --> 21:17.071
-Nice meeting you, though.
-Duncan!

21:17.155 --> 21:18.406
Hang on, there is somewhere.

21:22.618 --> 21:24.537
MOLLY: Hector was
so last-minute.

21:24.620 --> 21:28.041
We had to race to
the registry office
on the Vespa.

21:28.124 --> 21:31.627
The only white outfit I had
was my underwear.

21:31.711 --> 21:33.796
You were married
in your underwear?

21:33.880 --> 21:37.133
In those days,
skirts were so short,
they barely covered your...

21:37.216 --> 21:38.468
Hardly noticed.

21:39.719 --> 21:42.597
Every day,
I learn something new.

21:42.680 --> 21:45.433
I always thought I'd jet off
to Honolulu

21:45.516 --> 21:48.936
and tie the knot
on some sun-kissed beach.

21:49.020 --> 21:51.689
Very popular with stars
of the time...

21:51.773 --> 21:53.608
Oh, Molly, stop droning on.

21:55.151 --> 21:57.111
Tell me about your wedding.

21:57.195 --> 21:58.780
Small church, family affair.

21:59.655 --> 22:01.616
It's sad when love ends.

22:01.699 --> 22:06.829
Yes. Especially when
it ends in a messy
and very expensive divorce.

22:06.913 --> 22:12.001
I walked away with my record
collection and a truly ghastly
gilt standard lamp.

22:12.085 --> 22:14.003
Poor you.

22:14.087 --> 22:15.838
A very long time ago.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.509
You've never even
considered remarrying?

22:20.218 --> 22:22.178
Not until now.

22:22.261 --> 22:25.723
Or, to be more exact,
until the first moment
I saw you.

22:25.807 --> 22:28.309
There must have been
other women, surely?

22:28.393 --> 22:30.019
One or two brief affairs.

22:30.103 --> 22:32.855
No one remotely like you.

22:32.939 --> 22:37.026
Well, why I should've been
singled out,
I really can't imagine.

22:37.110 --> 22:38.486
You really can't, can you?

22:39.904 --> 22:41.447
Andrew, you're dribbling.

22:42.782 --> 22:43.783
Oh!

22:57.714 --> 23:01.342
-It's just for one
night though, yeah?
-Whose gaff is this?

23:01.426 --> 23:05.221
Uh, it's this guy, Andrew.
He's moved into the big house.

23:05.304 --> 23:08.182
I'm supposed to be keeping
an eye on it for him.

23:08.266 --> 23:10.643
-You will be careful, yeah?
-Don't worry.

23:10.727 --> 23:14.063
Come round later,
we'll have a proper chat.

23:14.147 --> 23:17.358
-Yeah, okay.
But, please, Guy...
-Loosen up.

23:17.442 --> 23:19.277
It's me, Jess. Remember?

23:20.695 --> 23:22.321
Yeah, no worries.

23:22.405 --> 23:24.574
I'll have a long soak. (SIGHS)

23:24.657 --> 23:27.118
Make myself look beautiful.

23:27.201 --> 23:29.203
Okay. See you later.

23:29.287 --> 23:30.955
-Jess...
-Yeah?

23:33.875 --> 23:35.543
Oh, I'll leave them...

23:43.009 --> 23:44.010
(SIGHS)

23:47.138 --> 23:51.142
Oh dear, and Lexie was making
something special for dinner.

23:51.225 --> 23:55.104
-I'm absolutely mortified.
-Well, these things happen.

23:55.188 --> 23:57.190
Not if you add fuel,
they don't.

23:57.273 --> 23:59.025
And you, a world traveller!

23:59.108 --> 24:01.903
(LAUGHING) Not any more.

24:01.986 --> 24:05.490
It must have been
a very exotic business
that kept you abroad so much.

24:05.573 --> 24:07.867
Just business, that's all.

24:07.950 --> 24:11.704
Buying and selling was it?
Import, export, say no more?

24:11.788 --> 24:13.748
-Nothing so colourful.
-(LAUGHING)

24:13.831 --> 24:16.000
Overseas investments,
that's all.

24:16.084 --> 24:19.212
Spending other people's money.
I'd have been a whizz at that.

24:19.295 --> 24:20.296
(LAUGHING)

24:22.715 --> 24:26.302
AMANDA: Why keep it
twelve years, when you're
allowed to sell it at three?

24:26.386 --> 24:29.597
We have hundreds of thousands
of litres sitting in casks.

24:29.681 --> 24:33.726
-Meanwhile we can hardly pay
the lecky bill.
-So, what's your plan?

24:33.810 --> 24:36.104
Sell everything
four years and older.

24:36.187 --> 24:39.148
The supermarkets
will snap it up
for their own brand stuff.

24:39.232 --> 24:41.651
Invest the capital
in new equipment.

24:41.734 --> 24:43.069
So the Lagganmore continues?

24:43.152 --> 24:45.071
The distillery, yes.

24:45.154 --> 24:48.616
-But not the brand.
-We'll create a new brand...

24:48.700 --> 24:54.163
Leaner, stronger, modern,
with a more competitive
product in the bottle.

24:54.247 --> 24:55.540
Quite the evangelist.

24:56.624 --> 24:59.168
I need the casting vote.

24:59.252 --> 25:00.545
Lexie'll come through,
I'm sure.

25:00.628 --> 25:03.297
Which would be fine,
if time wasn't such an issue.

25:06.342 --> 25:07.969
I'll call in tomorrow
and sign.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.017
You've brought it with you.

25:14.100 --> 25:17.395
Ever prepared, Paul.
You never know
what's going to happen.

25:24.861 --> 25:26.529
That's the last, I'm afraid.

25:26.612 --> 25:29.657
-Thank you.
-Just the turps left.

25:29.741 --> 25:31.784
(LAUGHING)

25:31.868 --> 25:33.036
Silly!

25:34.370 --> 25:36.080
(SIGHS)

25:36.164 --> 25:38.207
I think tomorrow,
at breakfast,

25:38.291 --> 25:40.626
we should discuss
the plans for the house.

25:40.710 --> 25:41.794
Why, aren't you
happy with them?

25:41.878 --> 25:43.921
No, no, with Lexie and Paul.

25:44.005 --> 25:47.133
I mean they are family,
and they haven't had
much of a say.

25:47.216 --> 25:50.428
I'm sure they'll go along
with whatever's best for you.

25:50.511 --> 25:52.430
-You don't mind then?
-Of course not.

25:55.058 --> 25:57.477
-ANDREW: Must be an art lover.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

25:59.812 --> 26:01.731
Very good joke!

26:01.814 --> 26:03.316
Tell me another one.

26:10.531 --> 26:13.534
-What happened?
-The bike.

-I had you two lying
in a ditch somewhere.
-I am sorry.

26:17.872 --> 26:19.916
As long as you're
both all right.

26:19.999 --> 26:21.834
I had a boyfriend
like him myself once.

26:21.918 --> 26:24.671
He was always running
out of petrol
on some lonely road.

26:24.754 --> 26:27.840
I'm sure he measured it
down to the very
last teaspoon drop.

26:27.924 --> 26:29.509
Very funny.

26:29.592 --> 26:31.761
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll just go
and work on some
new material, shall I?

26:31.844 --> 26:33.304
For the next time
I have to rescue you!

26:33.388 --> 26:35.932
-It was hardly a rescue.
-Oh, I'm sorry,

26:36.015 --> 26:38.226
did you have
it all under control then?

26:38.309 --> 26:41.646
Let's not spoil it.
It's been such a lovely day.

26:41.729 --> 26:43.856
Do you want me to pick up
the bike now
or will I get it tomorrow?

26:43.940 --> 26:46.567
No, just load this stuff on
and let's get home.

26:46.651 --> 26:48.444
No point in trying
to save the dinner now.

26:48.528 --> 26:50.238
Would you rather drop me
off at the cottage?

26:50.321 --> 26:52.824
-If that's what
you want, then, yeah.
-Uh! No!

26:53.783 --> 26:55.660
That's a terrible idea.

26:55.743 --> 27:00.248
I mean...you two should be
together, not apart.

27:00.331 --> 27:03.042
Not on an evening like this.
Life's too short.

27:03.126 --> 27:04.585
I don't want to outstay
my welcome.

27:04.669 --> 27:06.713
Oh, come on.
How could you?
You two...

27:06.796 --> 27:08.673
Jump in the back,
I'll pop the rest
of this stuff on

27:08.756 --> 27:10.508

Well, I read your stuff.
Makes a pretty decent case.

So, perhaps you
and I could fix a time,

28:46.270 --> 28:47.647

in favour of Amanda's scheme.

28:53.152 --> 28:54.153
Oh, have you now?

28:56.823 --> 28:59.158
Right, well, I'll probably
say goodnight.

that needed dealing with.
-By me.

You didn't deal with it
when you should have done.

29:18.469 --> 29:21.222
No, I haven't dealt with it
because I haven't decided
which way to go yet.

Well, there wasn't
much choice.
They need to get on with it.

but I thought we had
this straight.

That doesn't include
you going behind my back

to exclude me
in spite of everything.

No! I am determined to run
this estate the way
Archie wants it run.

how much easier
it will be to look after,

(LAUGHING) No, of course not.

It's Archie's house,
naturally she doesn't
want things to change.

it'll be our house, too.

not working, then, Gregor?

was best for the company.

Under the new plan,
half the men

Our neighbour who supplies
the malt will go
out of business.

38:32.357 --> 38:36.361
-Never fails.
-We can get back in.
My stuff's in there.

38:36.444 --> 38:41.407
Nah, that would be
breaking and entering.
Why don't you just get lost?

38:41.491 --> 38:44.160
Jess doesn't want you here,
and neither do I.

38:44.243 --> 38:47.121
Think you're a big man, eh?
Some sort of authority figure?

38:47.205 --> 38:50.291
-Just get in your cars and go!
-GUY: Don't worry.

(SIGHS) What would you do?

39:30.581 --> 39:32.709
I really wish you were here

39:35.420 --> 39:36.796
Good night.

39:41.926 --> 39:43.678
What do you know about Andrew?

39:44.804 --> 39:46.514
Not a lot.

39:46.597 --> 39:51.436
I mean, there were
these three paintings,
portraits of women.

39:51.519 --> 39:53.521
Very smart looking,
all blonde.

41:26.739 --> 41:28.366

41:28.449 --> 41:30.284
Why did you
hang on to those paintings?

41:31.369 --> 41:33.913
-Sorry?
-The three women.

41:33.996 --> 41:35.373
Trophies, was it?

41:37.375 --> 41:39.002
Have you been snooping around?

41:39.085 --> 41:42.380
Oh! I'm not proud
of what I did,
but I'll live with it.

41:42.463 --> 41:45.133
I don't know how you can,
with three marriages.

41:45.216 --> 41:47.593
(LAUGHING)
Oh, no, you didn't...

41:47.677 --> 41:50.930
Good heavens, man,
they were models!
Nothing more!

41:51.014 --> 41:52.974
-Very plausible.
-It's the truth.

41:53.057 --> 41:55.101
The truth?

41:55.184 --> 41:57.895
You wouldn't recognise
the truth if it reached out
and shook you by the hand.

42:00.648 --> 42:02.483
Are you calling me a liar?

42:02.567 --> 42:05.528
I'm trying to imagine
what it was you said

42:05.611 --> 42:09.490
as you slipped that ring
onto their fingers.

42:09.574 --> 42:13.077
-This is nonsense.
-Course, I'm not very good
with words, but you are.

42:13.161 --> 42:14.662
You have a vivid imagination.

42:14.746 --> 42:16.330
It can't have been love...

42:18.291 --> 42:20.585
So it had to be money.

42:20.668 --> 42:22.837
How much, Andrew?

42:22.920 --> 42:26.341
How much did you take them
for before you rode off
into the sunset...

42:26.424 --> 42:30.053
-Making sure to take
your ring with you?
-What do you think I am?

42:30.136 --> 42:32.513
Oh, I know what you are.

42:32.597 --> 42:35.516
I just want to know
what you're going to do now.

42:35.600 --> 42:38.770
Are you still intending to
start a new life with Molly,
based on a pack of lies?

42:38.853 --> 42:40.980
I have not lied to Molly.
I never would.

42:41.064 --> 42:42.899
You never told her the truth.
No different.

42:42.982 --> 42:44.484
ANDREW: I have
told her the truth.

42:44.567 --> 42:45.860
I've told her that I love her.

42:45.943 --> 42:49.030
No doubt you said
the same to them.

42:49.113 --> 42:50.823
-I told you they were models.
-Yes, you did.

42:50.907 --> 42:52.367
-Molly's different.
-Not like the others.

42:52.450 --> 42:56.245
-That's the truth.
-Listen, Andrew,

42:56.329 --> 42:59.082
Molly's happiness means
more to me than anything else
in the world.

43:00.625 --> 43:02.794
Then be very careful
before you wreck it.

I'll make her happy.

give me a chance.

43:14.639 --> 43:15.723
Sorry, Andrew.

43:17.767 --> 43:19.394
You must tell her.

43:20.186 --> 43:21.479
Or I will.

(SIGHS) No...
No, you were right.

You know, running this place,
it's just so much me
and Archie.

I guess I just wasn't ready
to share.

(SIGHS) And now?

44:04.731 --> 44:08.609
Yes, please. But we'd better
come up with a bloody good

44:10.570 --> 44:14.198
(SIGHS) You know,
the best decisions
that Archie ever made

44:14.282 --> 44:18.369
were a blend of the coldly
logical and the ever so

44:20.913 --> 44:22.707
It's a skill all on its own.

44:24.667 --> 44:26.586
Well, contrary to
my genetic inheritance,

44:26.669 --> 44:28.004
I know nothing about whisky,

44:28.087 --> 44:31.007
so... And Amanda's right...

44:31.090 --> 44:33.551
Hardly anyone uses
a malting floor these days,

44:33.634 --> 44:37.138
let alone grinds their
own barley or makes
their own casks.

44:37.764 --> 44:39.265
The Lagganmore

44:40.308 --> 44:41.976
belongs to another age.

44:43.394 --> 44:45.355
(LAUGHING)

44:45.438 --> 44:47.231
I know what Archie would do.

44:48.358 --> 44:49.609
What?

44:49.692 --> 44:51.819
Paul, he's already done it.

45:01.496 --> 45:03.956
I was going to check
the spacing with you.

45:04.040 --> 45:06.501
You know the soil
so much better than me.

45:06.584 --> 45:10.463
(SIGHS) Well, you're going
to lose a few up here.

45:10.546 --> 45:14.008
Probably need a wee bit
of thinning out,

45:14.092 --> 45:17.303
but I think you've very much
hit the spot.

45:17.387 --> 45:20.264
-It'll make a fine wood.
-Thanks.

45:20.348 --> 45:22.934
I'll not live to see it,

45:23.017 --> 45:26.145
but maybe you
and your grandchildren
will get to enjoy it one day.

45:32.985 --> 45:35.154

after my girl, son.

it's only a few trees.

-What about jobs?

No redundancies,

46:00.013 --> 46:02.181
just natural wastage
until the manning's
at the right level.

46:02.265 --> 46:07.270
-But the 12-year-old,
it must stay.
-AMANDA: It will.

46:07.353 --> 46:10.481
The cash we raise
will be put straight
into marketing.

46:10.565 --> 46:13.693
Hopefully we'll return
to profit and then...

46:13.776 --> 46:15.111
I'd like to diversify.

46:17.113 --> 46:19.323
I knew there'd be a catch.

46:19.407 --> 46:21.576
I'm thinking something
the whisky snobs would

46:21.659 --> 46:23.828
really pay through
the nose for.

46:23.911 --> 46:26.956
Put Lagganmore on the map.
Big time.

46:27.040 --> 46:29.292
AMANDA: A special reserve,
Gregor.

46:35.423 --> 46:37.300
It can that, Miss McLeish.

46:39.344 --> 46:41.012
It'll be fit for the gods.

46:45.516 --> 46:50.021
(LAUGHING) I wanted to create
a special reserve
when your father was alive,

46:51.939 --> 46:53.858
but he was far too set
in his ways.

46:56.361 --> 46:57.904
I'd like to ask, as well,

46:57.987 --> 47:01.199
if Paul can take over
his late father's seat
on the board.

-If that's acceptable.
-Yes, it is.

I appreciate that.

drawn up in writing,

Those other women...

48:03.094 --> 48:04.512
I didn't love them.

48:05.930 --> 48:07.890
Did you tell them
that you did?

48:12.020 --> 48:14.272
My first marriage
ended exactly as I said.

48:14.355 --> 48:15.982
I was penniless.

48:17.066 --> 48:19.444
In those days,
I had a certain charm.

48:21.612 --> 48:25.241
And, anyway, they could
all well afford the money
they parted with.

48:26.826 --> 48:29.662
Did you tell them
you loved them?

48:29.746 --> 48:33.041
I didn't hurt them...
I don't think I did.

48:33.124 --> 48:36.502
-Maybe in a way...
-You were good for them.

48:36.586 --> 48:39.088
Made them feel alive,
wanted, loved, even.

48:39.756 --> 48:41.632
I love you,

48:41.716 --> 48:44.218
and I would have told you
all this. Everything.

48:44.302 --> 48:46.179
I want to believe that
you've been sincere

48:46.262 --> 48:48.181
in everything that's passed
between us, but...

48:48.264 --> 48:51.100
Every single word, I promise.

48:51.184 --> 48:53.311
But if I were to see
those portraits...

48:53.394 --> 48:54.771
I'll destroy them Molly.

48:54.854 --> 48:57.398
But if I were to see them,

48:57.482 --> 48:58.733
and I must...

48:59.776 --> 49:01.069
Would I recognise anything?

49:08.201 --> 49:09.327
ANDREW: I gave you that.

spend the rest of our

Keep it, please.

Think about it.
I mean, even now,
even after all this...

Can't we start again
from the beginning?
