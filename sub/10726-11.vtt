WEBVTT

00:00.302 --> 00:01.539
Every since I came out,

00:01.540 --> 00:03.622
my mom and I have been
having a hard time connecting.

00:03.745 --> 00:05.659
Luckily, we have "Project Runway."

00:05.771 --> 00:07.051
It's a place where she can be critical

00:07.052 --> 00:08.941
and I can be gay without her noticing.

00:08.942 --> 00:10.789
That dress looks like a trash bag.

00:10.892 --> 00:12.031
No, I think it is a trash bag.

00:12.032 --> 00:13.579
This is the trash bag challenge.

00:13.738 --> 00:15.081
Well, it looks like garbage.

00:15.082 --> 00:17.071
That dress looks like garbage.

00:18.102 --> 00:19.931
Yeah, get over here.

00:19.932 --> 00:21.061
That's right, Tim Gunn.

00:21.062 --> 00:23.921
Yep. "Runway" brought us together.

00:23.922 --> 00:26.091
And then it tore us apart.

00:26.092 --> 00:27.151
What's in the bag?

00:27.152 --> 00:29.091
Mm, well, you know how last night,

00:29.092 --> 00:31.131
Tim Gunn said that mesh is the new black?

00:31.132 --> 00:33.698
I think he called it "mesh-merizing."

00:33.699 --> 00:35.150
The only reason to watch
that show is to possibly get

00:35.152 --> 00:37.951
a flash of side booby
when the models change.

00:37.952 --> 00:38.951
No, Jimmy, it's great.

00:38.952 --> 00:40.091
If you like to watch people sewing.

00:40.092 --> 00:41.151
Well, they're crazy.

00:41.152 --> 00:43.041
Crazy.

00:43.042 --> 00:46.011
Anyway, I saw this cool
mesh shirt at fashion junkie,

00:46.012 --> 00:48.041
and I was thinking, I've been
wanting to update my look,

00:48.042 --> 00:50.051
you've been wanting me
to get a part-time job...

00:50.052 --> 00:52.151
No. You are not getting
a job at fashion junkie.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.971
They advertise with actual junkies.

00:54.972 --> 00:57.941
Mom, I can buy things
and you can critique them.

00:57.942 --> 01:00.031
It'll be like "Runway" all the time!

01:00.032 --> 01:02.061
That's the kind of thing
I like on my television,

01:02.062 --> 01:03.516
but I don't want it in my home.

01:03.667 --> 01:05.061
"That kind of thing"?
What does that mean?

01:05.062 --> 01:07.151
It means...

01:07.152 --> 01:09.131
You're not a mesh-shirt kind of person.

01:09.132 --> 01:12.001
That's a different kind
of person. That's not you.

01:12.002 --> 01:14.081
What she means is, I'm not
that kind of gay person.

01:14.082 --> 01:17.001
But what my mom didn't know
was that I was currently

01:17.002 --> 01:19.141
wearing the shirt under the one I had on.

01:19.142 --> 01:21.724
Are you currently wearing the
shirt under the one you have on?

01:22.112 --> 01:23.122
No.

01:25.122 --> 01:26.931
I feel texture.

01:26.932 --> 01:28.151
Come on, Mom!

01:28.152 --> 01:30.121
Kenny, if you want to take up sports,

01:30.122 --> 01:31.971
then you can wear mesh.

01:31.972 --> 01:33.785
Yeah, Kenny, do something straight,

01:33.786 --> 01:35.041
like wrestle men in your underwear.

01:35.042 --> 01:36.111
Then you can wear what you want.

01:36.112 --> 01:38.011
Yeah. Nice one!

01:38.012 --> 01:39.012
Whoo!

01:40.042 --> 01:41.981
"Nice"? What's nice?

01:41.982 --> 01:43.111
Is something fun happening up here?

01:43.112 --> 01:46.131
Mom won't let me wear a stylish shirt

01:46.132 --> 01:48.081
made of a controversial fabric.

01:48.082 --> 01:51.001
Well, we could always go
downstairs to Dad's house

01:51.002 --> 01:53.041
and talk about it over there,

01:53.042 --> 01:55.111
where I've been alone
for the last 48 hours.

01:55.112 --> 01:57.062
Not complaining.

01:59.032 --> 02:00.991
Feel free. Door's always open.

02:00.992 --> 02:03.041
Come on down and... You know...

02:03.042 --> 02:06.071
Just check and see if I've choked.

02:06.072 --> 02:08.622
My mom thinks she knows
what kind of gay person I am,

02:08.622 --> 02:09.971
but how could she?

02:09.972 --> 02:12.001
I'm still trying to figure it out myself.

02:12.002 --> 02:14.061
I'm still trying to
figure out that shirt.

02:14.062 --> 02:16.397
Tim Gunn, I thought you
said mesh was the new black.

02:16.558 --> 02:19.417
In this case, mesh is the new bleccch!

02:25.142 --> 02:26.932
Kenny?

02:28.102 --> 02:30.072
Come in!

02:32.613 --> 02:34.131
Kenny, I've been thinking a lot

02:34.132 --> 02:36.961
about this whole mesh thing, and...

02:36.962 --> 02:39.848
I realize I may not have
come off the way I intended.

02:40.152 --> 02:43.061
Thank you, Mom. I... sometimes...

02:43.062 --> 02:45.111
You're also forbidden to
wear leather, pleather,

02:45.112 --> 02:48.091
silks, lamÃ©s, or anything
with flowers on it.

02:48.092 --> 02:51.051
And it goes without saying,
obviously, nothing from Zara.

02:51.052 --> 02:52.991
Mom, I'm gay. I'm not European.

02:52.992 --> 02:55.041
I appreciate you wanting to make money,

02:55.042 --> 02:57.051
so I made a list of acceptable jobs.

02:57.052 --> 02:59.961
You can oil pews at the church,

02:59.962 --> 03:02.011
wash father Phil's car,

03:02.012 --> 03:04.081
work at a Catholic senior-living facility.

03:04.082 --> 03:06.961
Is there anything that doesn't involve me

03:06.962 --> 03:09.011
washing church things and/or old people?

03:11.062 --> 03:14.001
Tutoring. Okay, yeah. No, I'll do that.

03:14.002 --> 03:15.002
Great!

03:15.952 --> 03:17.081
Take it off.

03:17.082 --> 03:20.051
Seriously?! Through an inch
and a half of Terry Cloth?!

03:20.052 --> 03:22.021
Hey, guys, come down to my basement!

03:22.022 --> 03:23.081
I got a fun surprise for ya!

03:23.082 --> 03:24.991
Ugh. No.

03:24.992 --> 03:27.031
Dad's trying to have fun
with us in the basement again.

03:27.032 --> 03:29.041
I wish you'd stop
misusing the word "fun."

03:29.042 --> 03:31.981
Hey, guys! Who wants to
have fun killing a spider?

03:31.982 --> 03:34.041
Hey, guys, who wants to do a fun puzzle?

03:34.042 --> 03:36.950
Hey, guys, who wants to come
see my fun new popcorn machine?

03:37.922 --> 03:39.931
It's like when the dentist
gives you free floss.

03:39.932 --> 03:41.492
Just give it up, man. We know it sucks.

03:44.052 --> 03:46.131
Oh, my God. Dad got a dog.

03:52.962 --> 03:54.934
Meet the newest member of our family.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.011
Mom says we're not allowed
to have a dog in the house.

03:57.012 --> 03:59.011
Well, since we're getting a divorce,

03:59.012 --> 04:00.041
the basement is technically my house,

04:00.042 --> 04:02.141
and I make the rules, so
he's allowed down here.

04:02.142 --> 04:03.921
And so are you.

04:03.922 --> 04:04.941
Can we name him Brad?

04:04.942 --> 04:06.061
Yeah, if that's what you want.

04:06.062 --> 04:08.121
That is literally the
only thing that I want.

04:08.122 --> 04:09.941
- Okay.
- Where did you find him?

04:09.942 --> 04:11.081
He's a police dog.

04:11.082 --> 04:13.051
Remember that suspicious
package downtown last Christmas

04:13.052 --> 04:15.001
that turned out to be a bag of apples?

04:15.002 --> 04:16.151
All sergeant Hoffman... or Brad.

04:16.152 --> 04:19.041
Classic Brad.

04:20.142 --> 04:22.414
Yes, I'm still wearing the tie.

04:22.566 --> 04:25.001
First day on the job. Dress to impress.

04:25.002 --> 04:27.031
Stand up straight, shoulders back.

04:27.032 --> 04:28.981
Look them in the eye, firm handshake.

04:28.982 --> 04:30.131
Oh, and there's some matches in your bag

04:30.132 --> 04:32.011
in case a number two pops out.

04:32.012 --> 04:33.952
Okay. I got to go. I'm gonna be late.

04:35.042 --> 04:37.071
Don't worry. Time is just a construct.

04:37.072 --> 04:39.021
True.

04:39.022 --> 04:42.151
Uh, hi. I'm Kenny. Uh, I'm the tutor.

04:42.152 --> 04:43.961
I'm here for Jonathan.

04:43.962 --> 04:45.031
Oh, it's Yonathan.

04:45.032 --> 04:47.061
Are you "yoking"?

04:47.062 --> 04:48.111
You're not. I'm sorry.

04:48.112 --> 04:50.121
He's inside. I'm his mom... Sandra.

04:50.122 --> 04:51.111
Come in.

04:51.112 --> 04:52.131
Okay.

04:52.132 --> 04:54.051
Kick off your shoes.

04:54.052 --> 04:56.061
We go barefoot in our house.

04:56.062 --> 04:57.091
Really?

04:57.092 --> 05:00.951
I've never... Seen my mom's feet before.

05:00.952 --> 05:02.071
And feel free to take off your tie.

05:02.072 --> 05:03.951
You look like a tiny accountant.

05:03.952 --> 05:05.121
You're so fun!

05:05.122 --> 05:06.971
You're so fun!

05:06.972 --> 05:08.141
We should've gotten a tutor earlier.

05:08.142 --> 05:09.951
Right?

05:09.952 --> 05:12.021
No, I'm serious. Yonathan's
really struggling.

05:12.022 --> 05:14.071
Okay.

05:14.072 --> 05:17.041
So, the kid I'm tutoring, he's
gonna need a lot more help.

05:17.042 --> 05:18.991
He's more of a tactile, visual learner.

05:18.992 --> 05:20.101
Mm. So he's dumb?

05:20.102 --> 05:23.011
Um, Sandra says he is
intellectually free-spirited.

05:23.012 --> 05:25.031
Sandra sounds dumb, too. Who is she?

05:25.032 --> 05:26.091
Uh, she's the mom.

05:26.092 --> 05:28.981
And she's not dumb. She's
actually really smart.

05:28.982 --> 05:31.031
She was teaching me
all about gut bacteria.

05:31.032 --> 05:32.061
Oh, do tell.

05:32.062 --> 05:34.991
Well, I can't explain
it as well as Sandra,

05:34.992 --> 05:38.001
but basically, we should
be buying probiotic yogurt.

05:38.002 --> 05:40.021
You know that yogurt stuff is a scam.

05:40.022 --> 05:42.111
It's like pressed
juice and chiropractors.

05:42.112 --> 05:45.011
And we don't call adults
by their first names.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.111
Mom, Sandra's house is just different.

05:47.112 --> 05:48.991
They discuss ideas.

05:48.992 --> 05:50.151
She asks you about yourself

05:50.152 --> 05:51.951
and waits until you've
finished talking...

05:51.952 --> 05:53.102
sounds amazing.

05:55.072 --> 05:57.991
I'm just saying, she is very in tune

05:57.992 --> 05:59.991
with her family and surroundings.

05:59.992 --> 06:01.102
So am I.

06:04.082 --> 06:05.141
Did we get a dog?

06:05.142 --> 06:07.142
Don't be ridiculous.

06:08.637 --> 06:11.081
I don't want it in the kitchen,
I don't want it on the couch.

06:11.082 --> 06:13.081
I am not walking it or clipping its nails

06:13.082 --> 06:14.620
or brushing its fur.

06:14.621 --> 06:16.981
Don't worry, Eileen. You
will not have to do anything.

06:16.982 --> 06:18.921
This is gonna be my responsibility.

06:18.922 --> 06:20.942
Last time you said that,
we had a shotgun wedding.

06:23.381 --> 06:26.021
Well, buzzkill's gone, guys.
Let's have some fun, huh?

06:26.022 --> 06:27.991
Hey!

06:29.042 --> 06:30.941
Is Brad a fun dog?

06:30.942 --> 06:32.011
Jimmy, go get that for me, will ya?

06:32.012 --> 06:33.092
Got it.

06:35.042 --> 06:37.131
You do realize you're just
playing fetch with Jimmy?

06:37.132 --> 06:39.011
No, I'm not.

06:39.012 --> 06:41.011
Come on. He's gonna be fine.

06:41.012 --> 06:42.111
You're gonna get it
this time, right, buddy?

06:42.112 --> 06:44.151
Ready? Go get it!

06:47.112 --> 06:49.022
I'll go talk to Brad.

06:50.938 --> 06:52.131
Do you see what's happening here?

06:52.132 --> 06:54.011
Dad got the dog because he's desperate

06:54.012 --> 06:55.071
to spend more time with us.

06:55.072 --> 06:56.121
Oh, wow.

06:56.122 --> 06:58.141
That's a bummer.

06:58.142 --> 07:00.101
Maybe he's doing it 'cause he's lonely

07:00.102 --> 07:01.981
and he lives in the basement.

07:01.982 --> 07:03.021
I will slap you.

07:03.022 --> 07:04.121
Don't you dare let your stupid compassion

07:04.122 --> 07:06.031
screw this up for us, Jimmy.

07:06.032 --> 07:07.131
The only upside of divorce

07:07.132 --> 07:09.051
is that parents try to win you over.

07:09.052 --> 07:11.091
What's something you've
always wanted from Dad?

07:11.092 --> 07:12.961
A cross-country trip in an R.V.

07:12.962 --> 07:14.071
Where we share our hopes and dreams

07:14.072 --> 07:15.111
and sing cowboy songs.

07:15.112 --> 07:17.061
Get your head in the
game, man. Think bigger.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.141
Like, I always wanted to use
the computer in Dad's cop car

07:19.142 --> 07:21.091
so I could look up the
records of my teachers

07:21.092 --> 07:22.092
and blackmail them.

07:23.112 --> 07:25.031
I've always wanted to drive his cop car,

07:25.032 --> 07:26.101
make the sirens go "whoo-whoo."

07:26.102 --> 07:28.001
Good boy.

07:28.002 --> 07:30.041
Yes!

07:30.042 --> 07:33.921
Great job, Yonathan.

07:35.082 --> 07:37.111
Mom, if it's cool, I'm gonna
go facetime my girlfriend now.

07:37.112 --> 07:39.961
Just remember to close your
door so you have some privacy.

07:39.962 --> 07:41.951
God.

07:41.952 --> 07:44.021
That is just so different from my mom.

07:44.022 --> 07:46.931
I mean, she thinks
God is always watching,

07:46.932 --> 07:48.141
so it's okay if she does, too.

07:48.142 --> 07:50.041
What about you, Kenny?

07:50.042 --> 07:52.141
Smart, cute boy like you
must be dating someone.

07:52.142 --> 07:54.121
Me? Oh, God. No.

07:54.122 --> 07:55.921
No, no-no-no-no.

07:55.922 --> 07:57.942
Really? No cute boys at your school?

07:59.112 --> 08:00.941
Is it that obvious?

08:00.942 --> 08:02.051
I think that coming out

08:02.052 --> 08:04.951
is one of the bravest
things a person can do.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.021
That and composting.

08:07.062 --> 08:08.562
Okay, you were serious again.

08:08.688 --> 08:10.031
How'd you like to stay for dinner?

08:10.032 --> 08:13.051
I made a risotto with
fava beans and pea shoots

08:13.052 --> 08:15.011
and an heirloom tomato confit.

08:15.012 --> 08:16.695
Wow, I don't know what any of that means,

08:16.813 --> 08:18.111
but it sounds delicious.

08:18.112 --> 08:20.931
But, uh, but I can't. My
mom is expecting me home.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.011
God, it's like she can hear us

08:24.012 --> 08:26.141
talking about new food
she doesn't understand.

08:27.992 --> 08:29.061
Hello?

08:29.062 --> 08:30.961
Are you on your way?
I'm making your favorite.

08:31.962 --> 08:33.061
Costco meatballs.

08:34.131 --> 08:36.030
Yeah. No, no, no, I can hear.

08:36.032 --> 08:38.071
Um they sound delicious.

08:38.072 --> 08:39.467
Come on home.

08:39.582 --> 08:43.091
We can watch "Project Runway"
and have a glass of milk.

08:45.000 --> 08:51.074

08:52.922 --> 08:53.991
You know what, Mom?

08:53.992 --> 08:55.941
I think I'm gonna be here for a while.

08:55.942 --> 08:56.971
Oh. Okay.

08:56.972 --> 08:58.052
I'll save you a meatball.

09:01.052 --> 09:03.111
Maybe it was because
Sandra was new and exciting,

09:03.112 --> 09:05.021
or maybe I was sick and tired

09:05.022 --> 09:07.991
of the same old milk and meatballs.

09:07.992 --> 09:11.942
All I know is that I
just cheated on my mom.

09:16.628 --> 09:17.727
- You're late.
- Daah!

09:17.728 --> 09:19.527
You scared me.

09:19.528 --> 09:20.747
I thought you'd be asleep.

09:20.748 --> 09:22.617
I couldn't sleep.

09:22.618 --> 09:23.757
Also, it's 8:30.

09:23.758 --> 09:26.557
I thought we were going to eat dinner

09:26.558 --> 09:27.697
and watch "Project Runway."

09:27.698 --> 09:28.677
I know. Me too.

09:28.678 --> 09:29.747
But I-I couldn't leave

09:29.748 --> 09:32.597
while Yonathan was
struggling with fractions.

09:32.598 --> 09:34.597
I mean, you were
right... that kid is dumb.

09:34.598 --> 09:35.947
What's that on your collar?

09:37.718 --> 09:39.537
Tomato?

09:39.548 --> 09:40.677
Lipstick! I'm gay!

09:40.678 --> 09:42.618
I'm not an idiot, Kenny.

09:44.598 --> 09:46.687
Did Sandra make you dinner?

09:53.628 --> 09:55.607
N-no.

09:55.608 --> 09:57.547
No. Not at all. Wasn't dinner.

09:57.548 --> 09:59.697
It was just a very light snack.

09:59.698 --> 10:02.597
And it didn't mean anything.

10:02.598 --> 10:05.557
Wow! These meatballs look delicious.

10:05.558 --> 10:07.607
You know what I like.

10:09.578 --> 10:10.537
Mmm!

10:10.538 --> 10:12.727
You know what... I'm gonna...

10:12.728 --> 10:14.538
I'm just gonna top this off.

10:29.628 --> 10:32.667
We've got a problem here, Brad.

10:32.668 --> 10:34.697
Okay, so, if your turn signal is out,

10:34.698 --> 10:37.617
there is a variety of hand
signals that you can use.

10:37.618 --> 10:39.547
Pointing to the left
means you're turning...

10:39.548 --> 10:40.647
Left.

10:40.648 --> 10:42.667
Pointing up means you're turning...

10:42.668 --> 10:43.727
Right.

10:43.728 --> 10:45.717
What is the hand signal
for falling asleep?

10:45.718 --> 10:47.647
I don't think...

10:47.648 --> 10:49.667
hey, this was your idea, not mine, okay?

10:49.668 --> 10:52.677
Yeah, but when we said we
wanted to ride in the cop car,

10:52.678 --> 10:54.737
we didn't want a driving lesson.

10:54.738 --> 10:57.557
We wanted to see you be awesome.

10:57.558 --> 10:59.627
What do you want us to tell our kids?

10:59.628 --> 11:01.627
"Papa taught us how to parallel-park"

11:01.628 --> 11:03.538
or "papa taught us how to live"?

11:06.698 --> 11:08.657
You want to live?

11:08.658 --> 11:10.497
Fine. Let's live.

11:10.498 --> 11:11.627
That's what I'm talking abo...

11:11.628 --> 11:12.687
Aah!

11:12.688 --> 11:14.707
Aaaaaaaah!

11:16.528 --> 11:18.607
Hi, Eileen. I'm Sandra.

11:18.608 --> 11:19.687
I know who you are.

11:19.688 --> 11:21.537
And it's "Mrs. O'Neal."

11:21.538 --> 11:22.597
Hi, Sandra.

11:22.598 --> 11:23.587
Hi, sweetheart.

11:23.588 --> 11:24.677
Please come in.

11:24.678 --> 11:26.401
- Can she come in?
- Mm-hmm.

11:28.558 --> 11:29.687
So, what brings you here?

11:29.688 --> 11:31.677
Well, Kenny left his socks
at my house last night,

11:31.678 --> 11:33.587
so I figured I'd return them,

11:33.588 --> 11:36.687
and I got inspired to get some
that were a little bit more fun

11:36.688 --> 11:39.527
to thank him for helping with my Yonny.

11:40.528 --> 11:41.647
Wow! Sandra!

11:41.648 --> 11:42.647
Toe socks!

11:42.648 --> 11:44.577
It's like each toe has a little hat.

11:44.578 --> 11:45.547
I know!

11:45.548 --> 11:46.677
Thank you!

11:46.678 --> 11:47.678
Oh, sure.

11:55.748 --> 11:59.577
So, Kenny's been telling me
about some of the difficulties

11:59.578 --> 12:01.597
your son has had with his brain.

12:01.598 --> 12:03.393
And Kenny's expressed to me a little bit

12:03.394 --> 12:04.717
about the difficulties
the two of you have had

12:04.718 --> 12:05.747
since he came out.

12:05.748 --> 12:07.737
Oh! You've talked to
her about our family?

12:07.738 --> 12:10.667
We were in a real
sharing space last night

12:10.668 --> 12:12.618
while we were watching "Project Runway."

12:13.618 --> 12:15.727
And you two watched
"Project Runway" together.

12:15.728 --> 12:17.637
No.

12:17.638 --> 12:20.687
It was just on in the background
as we ate risott... Ohhhh.

12:20.688 --> 12:22.747
You ate her rice?

12:22.748 --> 12:24.637
Actually, quick side note...

12:24.638 --> 12:27.587
Risotto is made with rice
from the Arborio region,

12:27.588 --> 12:28.757
and it has so much starch in it

12:28.758 --> 12:30.747
that it's almost more like a pasta.

12:30.748 --> 12:33.667
Shut up, Sandra! Shut the up!

12:33.668 --> 12:35.587
You know, something
that was helpful for me

12:35.588 --> 12:37.677
when my family was having
problems was my church.

12:37.678 --> 12:40.747
First Unitarian. It's very open-minded.

12:40.748 --> 12:42.637
There's a joy mass tonight,

12:42.638 --> 12:44.657
with lots of people singing and dancing.

12:44.658 --> 12:45.627
Mm.

12:45.628 --> 12:47.587
Well, I sat through "Godspell" once.

12:47.588 --> 12:49.028
I don't think I'm gonna do it again.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.657
I think we'll just
stick with our religion

12:51.658 --> 12:53.557
that wasn't founded last Thursday.

12:53.558 --> 12:55.527
Well... Think about it.

12:55.528 --> 12:57.657
It's open 24 hours so
that homeless people

12:57.658 --> 12:59.747
and sex workers have a place to sleep.

13:00.748 --> 13:02.078
Wow.

13:02.248 --> 13:04.637
She looks so much older in person.

13:04.638 --> 13:06.647
Wait, what? How would you
know what she looks like?

13:06.648 --> 13:08.727
I saw a picture of her
with her dirty vegetables

13:08.728 --> 13:10.597
on your phone.

13:10.598 --> 13:12.727
You went through my phone?

13:12.728 --> 13:14.667
That is unbelievable!

13:14.668 --> 13:17.627
Well... Technically, that is my phone.

13:17.628 --> 13:19.717
Just like your belly
is technically my belly,

13:19.718 --> 13:22.537
even if some other
mother wants to fill it

13:22.538 --> 13:24.737
full of her extra-starchy rice!

13:24.738 --> 13:27.677
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

13:27.678 --> 13:29.577
Yeah! Whoo!

13:30.678 --> 13:31.657
Yeah!

13:31.658 --> 13:32.627
Whoo!

13:32.628 --> 13:33.587
Yeah, Dad!

13:33.588 --> 13:34.717
Whoo!

13:39.608 --> 13:41.557
Mrs. O'Malley has two D.U.I.S?

13:41.558 --> 13:43.617
Hello, "A" in history.

13:49.608 --> 13:50.717
Aaaaaah!

13:50.718 --> 13:53.607
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

13:55.568 --> 13:57.991
Yeah! Tokyo drift, bitch!

13:58.114 --> 13:59.707
That's why you hang with Dad, huh?

13:59.708 --> 14:00.747
Best day ever!

14:00.748 --> 14:02.567
All right, let's wrap it up,

14:02.568 --> 14:04.587
take this party back to my basement.

14:04.588 --> 14:06.557
Wait. Just one more thing.

14:06.558 --> 14:07.667
Backwards high-speed chase.

14:11.598 --> 14:13.398
Jimmy, no, no, no! You're
heading towards a...

14:19.548 --> 14:22.578
The grandkids are gonna
love this story, papa.

14:25.618 --> 14:28.537
Now, when they get to
the final runway show,

14:28.538 --> 14:29.637
we have to rank them

14:29.638 --> 14:31.697
and see if our choices
match up with the judges'.

14:31.698 --> 14:34.537
But they're all so talented.
Everyone should get an "A."

14:34.538 --> 14:35.747
Like I said, we have to wait.

14:35.748 --> 14:37.618
Everyone's a winner!

14:38.668 --> 14:40.598
Oh, yeah... more popcorn.

14:43.668 --> 14:45.657
I decided to give you another chance

14:45.658 --> 14:48.567
to come down and watch
"Project Runway" with me.

14:48.568 --> 14:49.747
Jodi keeps calling it "runaways."

14:49.748 --> 14:51.667
It's driving me crazy.

14:51.668 --> 14:52.687
Where are you going?

14:52.688 --> 14:53.757
Sandra's church.

14:53.758 --> 14:55.637
You absolutely are not!

14:55.638 --> 14:57.717
Afterward, Sandra and I
might watch another "runway."

14:57.718 --> 14:59.577
Maybe even "runway all stars."

14:59.578 --> 15:01.667
- You don't mean that.
- Oh, I absolutely do!

15:01.668 --> 15:04.537
I can see how a mom like
Sandra could lure you in,

15:04.538 --> 15:05.677
with her rainbow toe socks

15:05.678 --> 15:07.727
and that smile she throws
around like a weapon.

15:07.728 --> 15:09.547
That is not what it is.

15:09.548 --> 15:11.747
She accepts me. She accepts mesh.

15:11.748 --> 15:13.567
She accepts all of it.

15:13.568 --> 15:14.647
I do better than accept you.

15:14.648 --> 15:16.587
I protect you from
going out into the world

15:16.588 --> 15:17.657
and being judged by people

15:17.658 --> 15:19.627
based on some ridiculous
thing you're wearing.

15:19.628 --> 15:20.737
I don't have to go out into the world.

15:20.738 --> 15:22.698
I'm getting plenty of
judgment right here at home.

15:26.618 --> 15:28.577
As Heidi Klum would say, bon voyage.

15:30.650 --> 15:32.719
Brad, please get off the couch.

15:34.614 --> 15:35.614
Brad.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.037
Thank you.

15:43.947 --> 15:45.066
Are divorced people

15:45.067 --> 15:47.036
allowed to give each
other parenting advice?

15:47.037 --> 15:49.046
I just let my kids trash a cop car,

15:49.047 --> 15:51.136
and then to punish them,
I took them out for froyo.

15:51.137 --> 15:53.076
Well, that's nothing.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.986
Kenny went to church with another mom.

15:55.987 --> 15:56.996
Catholic?

15:56.997 --> 15:59.046
Unitarian.

15:59.047 --> 16:00.966
Whoa.

16:00.967 --> 16:03.076
He says it's because I don't accept him.

16:03.077 --> 16:04.046
You don't.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.156
Wha...

16:05.157 --> 16:07.077
I accept most of him.

16:08.967 --> 16:11.996
Well, kids always come
back to their moms.

16:11.997 --> 16:13.136
It's the dads that have to worry.

16:13.137 --> 16:15.046
I mean, I live 10 stairs away from them,

16:15.047 --> 16:16.156
and they barely come to visit.

16:16.157 --> 16:18.026
What's gonna happen when I move out?

16:18.027 --> 16:19.086
That depends.

16:19.087 --> 16:21.046
Is your new house gonna
smell like dog poo?

16:22.067 --> 16:24.126
I keep looking for it,
but I cannot find it.

16:24.127 --> 16:26.631
Well, just get the kids down
here and have them look for it.

16:26.795 --> 16:28.106
They're not gonna want to do that.

16:28.107 --> 16:29.707
Just tell them what you want them to do,

16:29.727 --> 16:31.252
and eventually, they'll get on board.

16:31.370 --> 16:33.036
You need to take a firmer hand.

16:33.037 --> 16:34.156
Well, maybe I am too soft on them,

16:34.157 --> 16:35.966
but when it comes to Kenny,

16:35.967 --> 16:37.673
I think you're a little bit too hard.

16:42.987 --> 16:44.106
It's in your shoe.

16:52.097 --> 16:54.986
Well, this is... new.

16:54.987 --> 16:57.966
Yeah, super-new and super-casual.

16:57.967 --> 17:00.036
Got jeans under my robe.

17:00.037 --> 17:02.166
Wow, Jesus. Boyfriend jeans.

17:02.167 --> 17:04.116
Yeah. Borrowed them from St. Peter.

17:05.311 --> 17:07.996
So, uh, you feeling
guilty about something?

17:07.997 --> 17:09.976
No, I'm not guilty.

17:09.977 --> 17:12.046
If Mom can't accept me for who I am,

17:12.047 --> 17:14.027
then I'm just gonna
be with people who can.

17:15.097 --> 17:16.946
Can't argue with that.

17:18.117 --> 17:20.106
Kenny. You made it.

17:22.067 --> 17:23.067
Come in.

17:26.107 --> 17:29.146
Uh, is this a "bring your own
tambourine" situation, or...

17:29.147 --> 17:31.116
- Oh, no. They're provided.
- Oh.

17:31.117 --> 17:33.146
Hi. Joy to you.

17:33.147 --> 17:35.126
I'd like to introduce you to Kenny.

17:35.127 --> 17:36.106
He's our newest member.

17:36.107 --> 17:37.126
Hi. Hello. Okay.

17:37.127 --> 17:40.026
Uh, joy to everyone.

17:40.027 --> 17:41.976
Joy to you.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.026
O... Kay.

17:43.027 --> 17:44.106
Welcome. Welcome.

17:45.117 --> 17:47.166
Oh. Okay.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.126
Ohh! So many hugs.

17:51.997 --> 17:53.056
Mom.

17:53.057 --> 17:55.096
Eileen. Hi.

17:55.097 --> 17:56.106
Joy to you.

17:56.107 --> 17:57.066
Uh-huh.

17:57.067 --> 17:58.986
Hello, Kenny.

17:58.987 --> 18:01.116
Um, Mom, uh, what are you doing here?

18:01.117 --> 18:02.259
Well...

18:02.395 --> 18:06.026
Another woman isn't gonna
bring my son to church.

18:06.027 --> 18:07.387
If this is where you want to be...

18:09.147 --> 18:10.987
I want to be here for you.

18:14.037 --> 18:16.067
Ohhhh... Boy.

18:17.937 --> 18:19.087
Okay.

18:21.520 --> 18:22.520
Hi!

18:26.117 --> 18:30.116
Sisters and brothers, let
us bow our heads and pray.

18:30.117 --> 18:31.937
That, I can do.

18:33.077 --> 18:35.056
To whom it may concern...

18:35.057 --> 18:37.100
No. I'm out. I'm sorry.

18:37.265 --> 18:38.777
Kenny, this is not a church.

18:38.882 --> 18:41.026
This is a bus station in Weirdoville.

18:41.027 --> 18:42.027
I can't do this.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.956
All these jeans. What is this, a mall?

18:45.957 --> 18:48.136
Is that guy hacky-sacking?

18:48.137 --> 18:50.106
But ultimately, we must figure out...

18:50.107 --> 18:52.156
Hey!

18:52.157 --> 18:54.167
I can't believe she left.

18:56.967 --> 18:58.977
I can't believe she came.

19:00.937 --> 19:04.026
Okay, Dad, where are
you taking us? Bowling?

19:04.027 --> 19:05.429
Ooh! Ooh! The Bahamas?

19:05.556 --> 19:08.694
Nope. We're gonna stay right
here and play with your dog.

19:08.695 --> 19:10.046
But... We don't want to do that.

19:10.047 --> 19:11.046
I don't care.

19:11.047 --> 19:13.016
Now, teach Brad how to fetch.

19:13.017 --> 19:14.016
I know you can do it.

19:14.017 --> 19:15.936
Dad, it doesn't fetch. Okay?

19:15.937 --> 19:17.146
It doesn't do anything.

19:17.147 --> 19:18.997
This plan is a huge bomb.

19:21.037 --> 19:23.076
Whoa! Look at him go!

19:23.077 --> 19:24.106
A bomb!

19:24.107 --> 19:26.096
He was on the bomb squad.

19:26.097 --> 19:28.016
Oh, my God. Look how happy he is!

19:28.017 --> 19:29.126
Come here!

19:29.127 --> 19:31.136
Who got the bomb, huh?
Yeah, you got the bomb!

19:31.137 --> 19:32.669
Jimmy, let's see what else he can do.

19:32.670 --> 19:34.056
Pretend you're attacking me.

19:34.057 --> 19:36.116
No, no! Don't do that. He
will literally kill you.

19:36.117 --> 19:37.966
He is trained to find drugs, though.

19:37.967 --> 19:39.156
Find the drugs.

19:39.157 --> 19:41.106
Who's got the dope? Who's got the dope?

19:42.153 --> 19:44.076
He's making a beeline for next door.

19:44.077 --> 19:45.136
Oh, my...

19:45.137 --> 19:46.712
Mrs. Novich has glaucoma!

19:46.713 --> 19:48.967
Brad!

19:53.107 --> 19:57.066
I can't tell... is that
a dress or an oil spill?

19:57.067 --> 20:00.086
It's definitely a natural disaster.

20:00.087 --> 20:01.586
So, how was the rest of church?

20:01.587 --> 20:04.096
I don't know. I, uh, left a
little after you, actually.

20:04.097 --> 20:05.156
You did? Why?

20:05.157 --> 20:06.575
Was it the tambourines

20:06.576 --> 20:08.136
or the white people with dreadlocks?

20:08.137 --> 20:11.146
It was...

20:11.147 --> 20:13.046
Neither of those things.

20:14.567 --> 20:17.096
It just didn't feel right.

20:17.097 --> 20:18.936
You know? It wasn't mine.

20:20.578 --> 20:23.036
Maybe my mom doesn't fully accept me now,

20:23.037 --> 20:25.126
but at least she's proved

20:25.127 --> 20:28.017
she's willing to start taking baby steps.

20:29.704 --> 20:31.116
Maybe you do look good in mesh.

20:31.117 --> 20:33.066
Oh, God. No, Mom. Mesh is not my thing.

20:33.067 --> 20:34.086
You were very right.

20:34.087 --> 20:36.066
Oh, thank God. Because I didn't mean it.

20:36.067 --> 20:38.066
I also cleaned out
everything in your closet

20:38.067 --> 20:39.957
that wasn't Navy or tan.

20:40.957 --> 20:43.093
I'm sorry, but this is a process.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.309
Okay, thank you for letting
me take another crack at this.

20:51.317 --> 20:53.992
Now, this is just the
one that shows my arms.

20:56.022 --> 20:58.141
See? It's just a whisper of mesh.

20:58.142 --> 21:00.131
What do you think?

21:00.132 --> 21:02.971
Honestly...

21:02.972 --> 21:04.991
It looks like your arms are two pale eels

21:04.992 --> 21:07.011
trying to escape a Fisherman's net.

21:07.012 --> 21:09.041
Tim Gunn, what do you think?

21:09.042 --> 21:10.981
Well, it definitely makes a statement.

21:10.982 --> 21:15.142
And the statement is, "my
gym membership has lapsed."

21:19.152 --> 21:20.731
Okay.

21:20.732 --> 21:26.702
