00:08.764 --> 00:10.315
Pop?

00:10.316 --> 00:12.483
Francis,
I'm in the sunroom.

00:13.931 --> 00:15.381
I'm having a whiskey.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.849
You want one?

00:16.851 --> 00:18.301
We have a guest.

00:18.303 --> 00:20.269
Well, does he want one?

00:20.271 --> 00:22.271
No, she doesn't.

00:22.273 --> 00:25.191
Come, join us.

00:31.065 --> 00:33.566
Hello.

00:33.568 --> 00:35.651
Sister Mary,
Frank Reagan.

00:35.653 --> 00:37.403
Thank you for seeing me.

00:38.373 --> 00:40.573
I didn't know I was.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.794
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.831
Sister Mary teaches middle
school at St. Dominic's.

00:49.050 --> 00:50.633
Oh.

00:50.635 --> 00:52.418
Well, thanks for your service.

00:52.420 --> 00:55.504
I've got some great memories
of St. Dom's.

00:55.506 --> 00:58.090
Not sure St. Dom's has great
memories of him, though.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.860
What can I do for you, Sister?

01:00.862 --> 01:04.480
I've come to ask you
for an intercession.

01:06.734 --> 01:09.935
Sister, um, whatever
influence I have,

01:09.937 --> 01:11.654
it is purely of this world.

01:11.656 --> 01:14.073
And so is the matter at hand.

01:14.075 --> 01:18.911
Commissioner, I have it from
good sources that St. Dom's

01:18.913 --> 01:20.863
is on a very
short list of schools

01:21.833 --> 01:23.593
the Archdiocese is
considering shutting down.

01:24.431 --> 01:25.918
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.537
I've put together a document

01:28.539 --> 01:32.291
that I think makes a good case
for keeping our school open.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.960
Well, again, Sister, this is
way outside my wheelhouse.

01:34.962 --> 01:38.013
But I know you have
a standing lunch

01:38.015 --> 01:39.548
with His Eminence the cardinal

01:40.301 --> 01:41.634
the third Thursday
of each month.

01:43.971 --> 01:45.604
What was I gonna do, hold back?

01:45.973 --> 01:46.889
She's a nun.

01:46.891 --> 01:49.608
If you'd be so kind
as to let me

01:49.610 --> 01:51.170
walk you through our case,
I'm confident

01:52.196 --> 01:53.896
you'd be our very best voice
with His Eminence.

01:53.898 --> 01:56.282
Sister, of course.

01:56.284 --> 01:58.150
I'll listen.

01:58.152 --> 01:59.535
But I can't promise anything.

01:59.537 --> 02:01.153
Oh, no promises expected.

02:01.155 --> 02:02.371
Or accepted.

02:02.373 --> 02:04.757
And, by all means,
get your drink first.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.492
Can I get you something?

02:06.494 --> 02:08.627
Two fingers of bourbon, please.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.413
Over one cube of ice.

02:12.717 --> 02:15.918
I'll have what
she's having.

02:20.174 --> 02:24.176
Police! Anybody! Help!

02:24.178 --> 02:26.395
He's trying
to kill her!

02:26.397 --> 02:28.347
Police!
Police, please!

02:28.349 --> 02:30.015
He's got a knife!

02:30.017 --> 02:31.700
He's trying
to kill her!

02:31.702 --> 02:32.935
Where is he?
Where is he?

02:33.438 --> 02:34.438
On the second floor.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.274
Ma'am, stay here.
Stay here.

02:42.246 --> 02:44.697
Police! Don't move!
You lying bitch!

02:44.699 --> 02:47.032
Drop your weapon!
Get down on the ground!

02:47.102 --> 02:47.950
Drop your weapon!

02:47.952 --> 02:49.201
Eddie, call a bus.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.836
Okay. All right.

02:54.542 --> 02:55.542
Okay.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.852
Okay. Reagan!

03:08.105 --> 03:10.022
Reagan, I don't think
we have time for a bus!

03:10.558 --> 03:11.774
He's going to the roof!

03:11.776 --> 03:14.193
We got to take her to St.
Benjamin's around the corner.

03:14.612 --> 03:16.228
Now! Come on, now!

03:16.230 --> 03:17.897
Come on!

03:19.700 --> 03:21.734
Look at me, look at me,
look at me. Okay.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.119
Help me, help me.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.321
We got you.

03:25.323 --> 03:26.956
We got to get
her to the car.

03:27.008 --> 03:28.190
Wait, wait.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.660
Okay, we got you.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:40.087 --> 03:41.847
She's got a pretty deep wound
to her abdomen.

03:41.890 --> 03:43.939
Got it.
We'll take it from here.

03:46.928 --> 03:51.096
We're gonna have to take her
straight to the O.R.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.103
Reagan, behind you!
It's him!

03:58.105 --> 03:59.688
Let's finish this, bitch!

04:05.997 --> 04:08.030
Move. Get her out of the way!

04:08.032 --> 04:09.365
Drop your knife!

04:09.367 --> 04:10.783
Drop your knife!

04:13.838 --> 04:16.704
Reagan.
Get some distance, Reagan.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.011
Get her inside!

04:26.017 --> 04:27.850
Are you okay?
Yeah.

04:27.852 --> 04:29.718
You good?
Yeah.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.387
Stop fighting me.

04:33.808 --> 04:36.191
You all right, Reagan?

04:37.278 --> 04:38.143
Get up!

04:38.145 --> 04:40.195
What do we got here, Reagan?

04:40.197 --> 04:41.897
We got everything
under control here, Mike.

04:42.316 --> 04:42.865
You all right?

04:42.867 --> 04:43.899
You're bleeding.

04:43.901 --> 04:44.950
Nah, it's nothing.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.485
It's not nothing,
you might need stitches.

04:46.538 --> 04:48.378
Yeah, Reagan. You do.
Hey, why don't you let me

04:48.539 --> 04:49.854
take him back
to the house,

04:49.874 --> 04:51.089
while you get
your head looked at?

04:51.158 --> 04:52.374
You prepare an aided card
on the victim.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.493
Nah.
Go ahead.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.745
Hey, hey. What's the problem?

04:56.747 --> 04:58.547
Ask him.

04:59.417 --> 05:02.001
Oh, come on.
We were rookies.

05:02.003 --> 05:04.887
I sort of took credit
for an arrest he made.

05:04.906 --> 05:05.971
Not "sort of."

05:05.973 --> 05:07.339
Just messing with you, come on.

05:07.359 --> 05:08.559
Look, I don't need the collar.

05:08.560 --> 05:11.425
I already made detective.
Oh, yeah.

05:11.429 --> 05:12.194
And you know the difference
between detective third grade

05:12.229 --> 05:13.309
and detective second grade?

05:13.314 --> 05:14.146
What?
Collars. Lots of them.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.814
Any way you can get them.
Seriously?

05:16.651 --> 05:18.100
Reagan, you're
bleeding pretty bad.

05:18.102 --> 05:20.486
Really ought to get it
looked at.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.820
Come on.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.405
Let's go.

05:25.860 --> 05:27.109
He's our collar, Mike.

05:39.373 --> 05:41.340
Hey. Detectives Reagan
and Baez.

05:41.342 --> 05:42.791
You first on
the scene?

05:42.793 --> 05:44.710
Yeah, me and my partner.
What happened?

05:44.713 --> 05:47.211
Well, we're still canvassing,
but we know

05:47.214 --> 05:49.130
two young white guys, driving by...
Uh-huh.

05:49.216 --> 05:50.816
yell some anti-gay stuff
to a guy coming out of the bar.

05:50.851 --> 05:51.884
Then what?

05:51.886 --> 05:53.519
He yelled something back.
They get out of the car

05:53.538 --> 05:54.620
and come at him with a bat.

05:54.772 --> 05:55.554
How bad?

05:55.556 --> 05:57.189
Got his head bashed in
pretty good.

05:57.258 --> 05:58.490
That's where he went down.

06:01.646 --> 06:03.812
Anybody get a good look
at the perps?

06:03.815 --> 06:05.480
Good Samaritan.
Came out of the bar,

06:05.511 --> 06:07.231
got in the middle of it,
threw some punches,

06:07.235 --> 06:09.551
and the punks took off.
Good Samaritan got a name?

06:09.571 --> 06:11.520
Wouldn't give it.
My partner's talking to him.

06:11.906 --> 06:13.706
The guy with the red hoodie.

06:15.459 --> 06:17.076
Red hoodie.

06:17.078 --> 06:18.494
Where the hell's he going?

06:18.913 --> 06:19.578
Hey, yo!

06:19.580 --> 06:21.130
Red hoodie!

06:21.132 --> 06:23.582
Hey, Red Riding Hood, hold on.

06:23.584 --> 06:24.500
Hold on.

06:24.502 --> 06:26.168
I need to ask
you a question.

06:26.470 --> 06:28.137
Fuentes.

06:28.139 --> 06:29.304
Alex?

06:29.306 --> 06:31.557
What are you doing?

06:31.559 --> 06:33.926
You... working under
cover or something?

06:33.928 --> 06:35.427
No.

06:35.429 --> 06:36.645
So, what are you doing,
hanging out

06:36.731 --> 06:38.011
in the West Village
in a gay bar?

06:41.569 --> 06:42.685
Oh.

06:42.687 --> 06:43.986
Uh...

06:43.988 --> 06:46.105
Reagan, please, just
let me keep walking, man.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.605
I-I don't care. Look, did you
get a good look at the guys?

06:50.277 --> 06:52.194
Okay, so you did.

06:52.196 --> 06:54.279
My family finds out, you know?

06:54.281 --> 06:55.614
You know!

06:55.616 --> 06:58.167
I know, but...

06:58.169 --> 07:00.753
Look, you're a witness
to a crime, okay?

07:00.755 --> 07:02.788
You can't just
walk away here.

07:04.508 --> 07:06.341
I'll tell
you what we'll do.

07:06.378 --> 07:08.527
We won't put it
in the squad report,

07:08.546 --> 07:10.295
we'll just put it
in the DA's report.

07:10.381 --> 07:12.547
That way your family
and the squad won't know, okay?

07:12.633 --> 07:13.966
Please, just let me
keep walking.

07:13.968 --> 07:15.934
No. No can do.

How you holding up?

08:22.844 --> 08:25.462
The secret's out.

08:25.464 --> 08:28.515
Might as well
be a witness.

08:28.517 --> 08:30.277
Yeah. Well, sorry it had
to happen like that.

08:30.469 --> 08:31.798
Thanks.

08:32.417 --> 08:33.917
You up for some questions?

08:33.919 --> 08:36.419
Yeah, sure.

08:36.421 --> 08:38.721
Happen to get a look
at these yahoos?

08:38.722 --> 08:40.807
Yeah, um...

08:40.808 --> 08:42.558
both male, white.

08:42.561 --> 08:45.178
Um, kind of size
could be 18 and an athlete

08:46.064 --> 08:47.647
or 25 and drink a lot of beers.
Okay.

08:47.667 --> 08:48.931
And one of them,
he was wearing like a, uh,

08:48.932 --> 08:51.682
like a football team
windbreaker, number 51.

08:51.770 --> 08:53.236
River Glen High School.

08:53.238 --> 08:54.487
I checked.

08:54.489 --> 08:55.605
It's in North Jersey,

08:56.274 --> 08:56.823
right on the New York border.

08:57.325 --> 08:58.525
Jersey. Okay, good.

08:58.527 --> 09:00.243
Do you think
you could I.D. them?

09:00.279 --> 09:01.279
Probably.

09:01.496 --> 09:03.396
Anything else
you can remember at all?

09:04.082 --> 09:05.365
No. Anybody get, like, a plate?

09:06.501 --> 09:08.751
No. We do know
that it's a dark SUV

09:08.838 --> 09:09.719
that happened
to come from Jersey.

09:09.772 --> 09:11.187
Security cameras?

09:11.289 --> 09:12.338
We're working on it.
Look--

09:13.124 --> 09:14.374
we're gonna get
these punks, okay?

09:14.376 --> 09:17.010
Strange time for you, huh?

09:17.012 --> 09:19.629
That's an understatement.

09:20.815 --> 09:22.465
How about your partner?

09:22.467 --> 09:25.518
Demarest, where's he?

09:25.520 --> 09:27.470
Didn't return my calls.

09:30.859 --> 09:35.195
Did you ever tell your partner
about your little secret?

09:35.197 --> 09:37.313
No.

09:53.465 --> 09:54.964
Hey, Hoffman!

09:54.966 --> 09:56.666
Reagan!

09:56.668 --> 09:57.834
How's your head?

09:57.836 --> 09:59.168
You stole our collar.

09:59.170 --> 10:00.887
Hey. Hey, hey.

10:00.889 --> 10:02.171
Easy.

10:02.173 --> 10:03.473
Nobody stole anything.

10:03.475 --> 10:05.091
Yeah, we get back
to the precinct,

10:05.177 --> 10:05.676
our prisoner's gone,
the transport sheet says,

10:06.570 --> 10:07.865
"Arresting Officer,
Mike Hoffman."

10:07.866 --> 10:09.015
So, the hell you talking about?

10:09.016 --> 10:11.756
I took him back, and I got him
to make a full statement.

10:11.757 --> 10:14.931
That he tried to kill his wife
'cause he's convinced

10:14.932 --> 10:16.473
she's doing her boss.

10:16.474 --> 10:18.924
Now he'll go
for attempted murder.

10:18.926 --> 10:21.875
And that's why I got
my gold shield two years ago,

10:21.876 --> 10:23.350
and you're still on patrol.

10:23.351 --> 10:25.218
You know what you did.

10:25.219 --> 10:26.151
You know exactly
what you did.

10:26.152 --> 10:27.317
I'll tell you what,

10:27.820 --> 10:29.319
you want a collar?

10:29.321 --> 10:32.823
You could get this guy
on menacing and assault two

10:32.825 --> 10:34.658
for the incident
at the hospital.

10:35.578 --> 10:37.494
Why don't you drop prints
on him for that?

10:41.584 --> 10:42.749
Hey, go for it, Reagan.

10:50.342 --> 10:51.892
Not now, Reagan.

10:54.396 --> 10:56.313
Unbelievable.

10:56.315 --> 10:57.981
Listen, you got to go
to your commanding officer,

10:58.017 --> 10:59.497
and you got to tell him
what happened.

10:59.503 --> 11:00.664
Not my style.

11:00.665 --> 11:01.997
Come on, this guy?

11:01.999 --> 11:03.959
He's just some schoolyard bully.
Bully pushes you,

11:03.968 --> 11:05.027
what do you do?
You push him back.

11:05.027 --> 11:07.603
Yeah, I know.
So what are you gonna do?

11:09.140 --> 11:12.007
I'm gonna push him back.

11:12.009 --> 11:14.977
That's it.

11:18.082 --> 11:20.850
She makes
a compelling case, Greg.

11:20.852 --> 11:23.119
I'm sure she does, Frank.
Who could resist a sister

11:23.121 --> 11:24.987
looking after the welfare
of little children?

11:24.989 --> 11:26.021
Not just emotionally.

11:26.023 --> 11:28.624
The parish has grown
its enrollment

11:28.626 --> 11:30.659
ten percent
in the last couple years.

11:31.595 --> 11:33.229
I took the liberty
of sending her research

11:33.231 --> 11:34.463
over to your office.

11:34.465 --> 11:37.366
Well, I'll have Goldfarb
and Bloomfield

11:37.368 --> 11:38.934
give it a thorough going-over.

11:38.936 --> 11:41.971
Goldfarb and Bloomfield.

11:41.973 --> 11:43.506
Yes, Frank, our appraisers.

11:43.508 --> 11:46.342
These are hard decisions,

11:46.344 --> 11:48.344
and they're made harder
if the deciders go

11:49.112 --> 11:50.613
all <i>Bells of Saint Mary's</i> on it.

11:52.416 --> 11:54.517
I need clear eyes and heads,

11:54.519 --> 11:57.520
because it's strictly
a real estate matter.

11:57.522 --> 11:59.655
Of course.

12:00.790 --> 12:04.293
There's one thing you could do
to help her cause.

12:04.295 --> 12:07.196
Name it.

12:07.198 --> 12:09.064
Chair the Trinity Society dinner

12:09.066 --> 12:10.933
and accept

12:10.935 --> 12:12.468
the Person of the Year award.

12:12.470 --> 12:13.511
I thought it was
Man of the Year?

12:13.571 --> 12:15.292
Oh, well, I've got to change
with the times.

12:15.705 --> 12:16.739
Ah.

12:16.741 --> 12:18.407
How many times have I asked you?

12:18.909 --> 12:20.209
Lost count.
Six.

12:20.211 --> 12:21.477
And I'm gonna keep asking you

12:21.545 --> 12:22.071
till you give in.

12:22.071 --> 12:24.003
Why don't you get it
over with, Frank?

12:24.003 --> 12:26.428
Now, at a time when you've got
skin in the game here,

12:26.484 --> 12:27.684
Saint Dom's.

12:30.559 --> 12:32.293
Are we horse-trading here?

12:32.295 --> 12:34.762
Yes.

12:36.164 --> 12:37.908
I'll chair it,

12:37.909 --> 12:39.575
but I still can't
accept the award.

12:39.644 --> 12:41.077
Separation of Church and State.

12:41.079 --> 12:42.278
That again.

12:42.280 --> 12:43.746
Now and always.

12:43.748 --> 12:45.314
Deal?

12:45.316 --> 12:47.550
The announcement
goes out tomorrow.

12:47.552 --> 12:48.718
I'll clear the copy

12:48.720 --> 12:49.986
with your DCPI.

12:49.988 --> 12:52.522
Good.

12:55.325 --> 12:56.492
Yeah, one was wearing

12:56.494 --> 12:58.127
a River Glen
football windbreaker--

12:58.129 --> 13:00.163
number 51.

13:00.165 --> 13:02.131
All right, great, Ronnie.

13:02.133 --> 13:03.366
Yeah, that's great.

13:03.368 --> 13:04.500
I'll see you then.

13:05.069 --> 13:06.002
Well, we got a mini-break.

13:06.004 --> 13:07.970
What?
Friend of my old man's

13:07.972 --> 13:10.039
is the chief of police
in River Glen.

13:12.710 --> 13:14.444
since we can't make an
arrest in New Jersey.

13:14.446 --> 13:16.446
Reagan, Baez.

13:16.448 --> 13:17.947
Want to step in?

13:26.090 --> 13:27.623
Close the door.

13:27.625 --> 13:29.592
Okay.

13:33.497 --> 13:34.931
What's up, Sarge?

13:34.933 --> 13:36.666
What's up is
Detective Fuentes is gay.

13:37.401 --> 13:38.434
He hid it
from Detective Demarest,

13:38.436 --> 13:40.336
his partner of eight years.

13:40.338 --> 13:43.806
Demarest is, like,
all bets off trust-wise.

13:43.808 --> 13:45.007
Is that about right?

13:45.342 --> 13:47.310
All right.

13:47.312 --> 13:48.511
So?

13:48.513 --> 13:49.579
So, Reagan,

13:49.581 --> 13:50.941
you're gonna partner
with Demarest,

13:50.949 --> 13:52.548
and you're gonna stay
on the West Village beating.

13:52.583 --> 13:53.683
Baez,

13:53.685 --> 13:55.084
you're gonna ride with Fuentes

13:55.686 --> 13:56.586
on the phone robbery guy.

13:56.588 --> 13:58.020
That's gonna fix what, Sarge?

13:58.388 --> 13:59.088
We'll see.

13:59.090 --> 14:00.456
It'll be for a couple of tours.

14:01.692 --> 14:04.260
You do know the '50s
was 60 years ago, right?

14:06.096 --> 14:08.064
You two can't figure this out
between the two of you?

14:08.066 --> 14:09.599
There's nothing to figure out;
I don't want to work with him.

14:10.100 --> 14:10.900
End of story.

14:10.902 --> 14:11.968
Fuentes?

14:11.970 --> 14:13.703
It's for the best.

14:13.705 --> 14:15.204
He already wakes up angry.

14:16.106 --> 14:16.973
Even on his days off
and the sun's out.

14:17.041 --> 14:18.074
Screw you.
Jerry,

14:18.376 --> 14:19.976
when Kelly held that thing back
from you...

14:20.043 --> 14:20.943
Shut up.

14:20.945 --> 14:22.505
...you and me,
we talked things through.

14:23.113 --> 14:24.380
Shut the hell up, Fuentes!

14:24.382 --> 14:25.822
It saved your marriage, man!

14:26.650 --> 14:27.950
And maybe it could work
for you and me.

14:27.952 --> 14:30.072
We talk things through!
You bringing up Kelly and me?!

14:30.254 --> 14:31.254
You think this it that?

14:31.855 --> 14:32.839
Man, I am just trying
to help you, all right?

14:32.840 --> 14:34.190
Here's help!
Hey!

14:34.192 --> 14:35.224
Back off!

14:35.226 --> 14:36.993
Demarest!

14:36.995 --> 14:38.194
Get off me, Reagan!

14:38.729 --> 14:39.395
Demarest, you stand down

14:39.397 --> 14:40.696
or I suspend you!

14:40.698 --> 14:41.998
You got that?

14:42.000 --> 14:43.566
Yeah, I got that.

14:43.568 --> 14:44.867
All right, you go outside

14:45.335 --> 14:46.335
and you walk it off.

14:46.370 --> 14:48.437
Now!

14:48.439 --> 14:50.206
Go on. Beat it.

14:52.009 --> 14:53.943
You all right?

14:55.112 --> 14:56.579
Yeah.

15:00.284 --> 15:03.085
Go out there and cool off
your new partners.

15:03.087 --> 15:05.321
But, Sarge...
Go!

15:17.357 --> 15:18.559
<i>The commissioner will make</i>

15:18.560 --> 15:21.160
a statement, and then he'll
take your questions.

15:25.332 --> 15:29.601
The victim, a male Caucasian,
is in critical condition,

15:29.603 --> 15:33.439
despite the heroic efforts
of the off-duty detective

15:33.441 --> 15:35.974
who intervened in the incident.

15:35.976 --> 15:38.243
The perpetrators fled the scene

15:38.245 --> 15:39.712
and are still at large.

15:39.714 --> 15:43.949
And yes, given the location
of the incident

15:43.951 --> 15:45.818
and the fact that

15:45.820 --> 15:48.587
numerous witnesses heard
homophobic slurs

15:48.589 --> 15:50.222
from the perpetrators,

15:50.224 --> 15:53.726
we are classifying this
as a hate crime.

15:53.728 --> 15:55.728
I will take your
questions now.

15:58.732 --> 16:01.233
One at a time, please.

16:01.235 --> 16:03.836
Let's see, Theresa.

16:03.838 --> 16:06.805
Can you tell us the name
of this hero cop?

16:06.807 --> 16:09.408
I believe he prefers
to remain anonymous.

16:09.410 --> 16:10.776
Steve?

16:10.778 --> 16:13.746
Yeah, according to my sources,
the so-called hero

16:13.748 --> 16:16.415
was an off-duty detective
who's a closeted homosexual.

16:16.417 --> 16:18.117
Is there a question in there?

16:18.119 --> 16:20.552
Well, can you confirm
that the cop in question

16:21.154 --> 16:22.721
is Detective Alex Fuentes?

16:22.723 --> 16:25.090
No.

16:25.092 --> 16:27.059
Robert?

16:27.061 --> 16:29.828
The Catholic Church
condemns homosexuality as a sin,

16:29.830 --> 16:31.897
and the commissioner
is famously Catholic.

16:31.899 --> 16:34.199
Uh, how do you line up
your anti-gay faith

16:35.268 --> 16:37.402
with your role as a, uh,
equal-opportunity employer?

16:37.404 --> 16:39.738
What my men and women do
in private

16:39.773 --> 16:41.206
is their own business.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.909
So you only condemn
homosexuality on Sunday?

16:45.713 --> 16:48.147
Well, I do believe
that the Church

16:48.149 --> 16:50.349
is a little behind the times
on this,

16:50.683 --> 16:52.284
but then,

16:52.286 --> 16:55.554
I still miss
the Latin mass, so...

16:55.556 --> 16:56.922
Next question.

16:56.924 --> 16:58.056
Uh, Commissioner,

16:58.058 --> 16:59.298
can we get back
to the incident?

16:59.659 --> 17:01.193
Yes, please.

17:01.195 --> 17:05.396
Did the officer sustain
any injuries...

17:11.104 --> 17:12.538
Thank you
for meeting us, Detective.

17:13.239 --> 17:14.473
I'm sorry
about what happened.

17:14.474 --> 17:17.041
The weird thing about Hoffman,
he's a damn good detective,

17:18.211 --> 17:20.451
which put him on the fast track
and also made him greedy.

17:21.047 --> 17:22.347
Yours isn't the first collar
he's accused of snatching.

17:22.348 --> 17:23.582
Yeah, he's got
that hook downtown.

17:23.584 --> 17:24.825
His uncle is
a deputy commissioner.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.151
You got a bigger hook.

17:26.153 --> 17:27.486
I mean, you got a crane.

17:28.320 --> 17:29.288
No, I-I got a father
who's the PC,

17:29.356 --> 17:30.207
but he'd never be my hook.

17:30.272 --> 17:32.687
Yeah, and he'd never ask him
to be either, believe me.

17:33.359 --> 17:34.760
So what can I do for you?

17:34.762 --> 17:36.010
We're looking to return
the favor.

17:36.011 --> 17:37.701
We want to steal a collar
from Hoffman.

17:38.531 --> 17:40.065
Really?

17:40.067 --> 17:41.233
Yeah.

17:44.037 --> 17:45.804
Actually, you know
that guy, Spiderboy?

17:45.806 --> 17:48.173
Been in the papers.
Yeah.

17:48.175 --> 17:50.415
He comes in through the fire
escape, takes what he wants,

17:51.044 --> 17:52.678
tags a spiderweb on the wall.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.680
Yesterday, Hoffman is bragging
that's he's got a CI

17:54.948 --> 17:55.747
giving up Spiderboy.

17:55.749 --> 17:57.282
Got a search warrant
on his apartment

17:58.184 --> 17:59.664
and to look for him
in Monday's paper.

18:00.453 --> 18:01.753
Well, what's he waiting for?

18:02.722 --> 18:03.889
Well, he's got
some weekend trip planned

18:03.891 --> 18:05.224
to, uh, Puerto Rico.

18:05.226 --> 18:06.825
Non-refundable tickets.

18:06.827 --> 18:08.293
Well, hey,

18:08.295 --> 18:09.661
do you know
who the informant is?

18:10.230 --> 18:11.697
Sorry, that's all I got.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.498
And you didn't hear it from me.

18:13.766 --> 18:14.499
Yeah.

18:14.501 --> 18:15.634
All right, good luck.

18:16.102 --> 18:17.102
Thanks.
Thanks.

18:17.104 --> 18:19.204
Good.

18:19.206 --> 18:22.040
What's good? We don't know who
this guy is or where he lives.

18:22.175 --> 18:23.905
Well, his name and address will
be on the search warrant,

18:23.906 --> 18:25.652
and if there's a search warrant,
any cop can go in

18:25.652 --> 18:26.513
and make the pinch.
Yeah, but it's not like

18:26.513 --> 18:28.476
Hoffman's gonna show us
the search warrant.

18:28.476 --> 18:29.999
No, but somebody else might.

18:30.450 --> 18:31.250
Who?

18:31.252 --> 18:33.085
I never use my hook
down at One PP,

18:33.180 --> 18:35.220
but I do have a hook
in the D.A.'s office

18:35.261 --> 18:37.289
that I don't mind working.

18:37.791 --> 18:40.659
Ooh, tricky.

18:46.599 --> 18:48.700
Here's the victim's mother.

18:51.604 --> 18:52.771
Ms. Elvers?

18:52.773 --> 18:53.906
Yes?

18:53.908 --> 18:56.808
Detective Reagan.
This is Detective Demarest.

18:56.810 --> 18:58.677
Hello.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.112
How's your son doing?

19:00.114 --> 19:02.948
He has
an intracranial hemorrhage.

19:02.950 --> 19:05.684
They're going to operate.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.185
I'm sorry to hear that.

19:07.187 --> 19:09.121
I'll be sure to
say a prayer.

19:09.789 --> 19:11.456
Yeah, I'll get one off, too.

19:11.458 --> 19:13.558
Thank you.

19:13.560 --> 19:14.660
Everyone in New York

19:14.662 --> 19:16.528
is so much kinder
than I thought.

19:16.630 --> 19:18.141
Well, believe it or not,
there are actually

19:18.141 --> 19:19.731
a few nice people in this city,

19:20.300 --> 19:21.400
and we certainly want

19:21.402 --> 19:23.869
to bring to justice the people
who did this to Martin.

19:23.873 --> 19:25.270
I hope you catch them.

19:25.272 --> 19:26.305
Me, too.

19:26.307 --> 19:28.240
Do you mind if we ask you
a few questions?

19:28.675 --> 19:29.942
I'll do my best.

19:29.944 --> 19:31.143
Can you think

19:31.145 --> 19:33.712
of anybody that might want
to hurt your son?

19:37.084 --> 19:39.818
I just can't imagine.

19:42.155 --> 19:43.689
Do you know

19:43.691 --> 19:46.625
if Martin had any problems
with anyone,

19:46.627 --> 19:48.560
enemies at work, anything?

19:48.562 --> 19:52.364
Detective,
Martin is a veterinarian.

19:52.366 --> 19:55.901
He is a gentle soul.

19:58.504 --> 20:00.672
When he was five,

20:00.674 --> 20:03.004
he kept all the stuffed animals
on his bed

20:03.005 --> 20:04.344
in alphabetical order.

20:04.345 --> 20:05.544
Bear,

20:05.546 --> 20:07.212
cat,

20:07.214 --> 20:08.747
dog, elephant and so on.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.717
And one day,

20:11.719 --> 20:14.853
I noticed they were
in a different order.

20:15.655 --> 20:17.189
And when I asked him about it,

20:18.091 --> 20:20.025
he whispered that they were
in the order

20:20.027 --> 20:22.194
of how much he loved them.

20:25.832 --> 20:27.599
And then he said to me,

20:28.201 --> 20:29.434
"Please don't tell them.

20:29.436 --> 20:32.237
I don't want to hurt
anyone's feelings."

20:35.608 --> 20:39.111
This is not a man with enemies.

20:39.846 --> 20:42.247
Okay.

20:50.624 --> 20:51.990
Tell you,

20:51.992 --> 20:53.959
it's the ones who don't cry.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.328
They're the hardest.

20:56.330 --> 20:57.496
Huh?

20:57.498 --> 21:00.198
The mom back there.

21:00.200 --> 21:03.035
She starts bawling,
then we give her a tissue

21:03.037 --> 21:04.536
or a cup of coffee.

21:04.604 --> 21:05.721
We have a role to play.

21:05.721 --> 21:07.657
Instead, she just sits
there, all brave,

21:07.657 --> 21:10.076
not wanting to make a scene
or inconvenience anyone,

21:10.743 --> 21:12.210
but she's definitely
torn up inside.

21:12.212 --> 21:13.311
Uh-huh.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.447
I'm just saying.

21:16.783 --> 21:19.117
We need to find those bastards.

21:19.119 --> 21:21.920
Here we are. Garden State.

21:21.922 --> 21:24.122
Hmm.

21:25.024 --> 21:26.925
You like Jersey?

21:26.927 --> 21:28.427
I do.

21:28.429 --> 21:30.028
Shore's nice.
You like the shore?

21:30.263 --> 21:31.530
Eh...

21:33.032 --> 21:35.200
You just gonna sit there
and groan

21:35.202 --> 21:37.436
the whole time or what?

21:38.971 --> 21:40.038
I hear you.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.807
He's your partner,

21:41.809 --> 21:43.708
day in, day out,
on duty, off...

21:44.444 --> 21:45.744
He knows everything
about you.

21:45.746 --> 21:47.879
Including your
anger issues.

21:47.881 --> 21:49.390
Did he talk to you about me?

21:49.391 --> 21:50.587
No, he didn't talk to me...

21:50.588 --> 21:52.584
My so-called anger issues?
No.

21:52.586 --> 21:55.454
Just referring to
what he said in the office

21:55.456 --> 21:57.089
about talking things out

21:57.091 --> 21:58.623
and you and
your wife.

21:58.858 --> 21:59.758
Oh.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.760
You know, maybe
he's secretly relieved

22:01.762 --> 22:03.362
you're not riding along
with him anymore.

22:03.830 --> 22:05.730
I know I'd be.

22:12.338 --> 22:14.339
Is that our guy?

22:14.341 --> 22:15.407
No.

22:15.409 --> 22:17.642
Our guy is
six foot two.

22:17.644 --> 22:18.944
Right.

22:18.946 --> 22:20.545
Well, it looked
a little like him.

22:20.813 --> 22:22.114
Yeah.

22:25.151 --> 22:28.253
Alex, if it's tough to ignore
the elephant in the room,

22:28.255 --> 22:29.721
it's gonna be
really tough

22:30.456 --> 22:31.790
to ignore the elephant
in the car.

22:32.892 --> 22:35.360
You talk to
your family?

22:35.362 --> 22:37.729
What, you mean
since I got outed?

22:37.731 --> 22:39.898
Well, yeah.

22:41.267 --> 22:42.767
I tried.

22:42.769 --> 22:45.403
It was a... a short
conversation,

22:45.405 --> 22:47.772
mostly one-sided.

22:47.774 --> 22:50.275
My old man, he said,
"You're out...

22:50.277 --> 22:51.810
"here's what
else is out.

22:51.812 --> 22:54.880
"Holidays, family reunions,
christenings, weddings.

22:54.882 --> 22:58.150
Don't ever come
around here again."

22:59.185 --> 23:00.886
I'm sorry.

23:00.888 --> 23:02.787
You know...

23:02.789 --> 23:06.725
when I was a kid, like eight,
my old man,

23:06.727 --> 23:09.294
he'd have his buddies over
to play dominoes, right?

23:09.296 --> 23:11.263
And, uh, my mom,

23:11.265 --> 23:12.864
she almost, like, coached me

23:12.866 --> 23:14.299
before I went into a room,

23:14.834 --> 23:16.902
on how to walk, stand,

23:16.904 --> 23:18.703
not to be funny, you know,

23:18.705 --> 23:20.539
because my kind of funny
was just weird

23:21.207 --> 23:22.574
for my old man and his friends.

23:26.212 --> 23:28.246
Well, she did a hell of a job.

23:29.215 --> 23:30.749
Because you being gay
comes as a big surprise.

23:30.983 --> 23:32.651
Yeah.

23:34.588 --> 23:35.787
You lose your family

23:35.789 --> 23:37.109
and your partner
in the same week.

23:37.657 --> 23:38.757
That's got to be
tough, man.

23:38.759 --> 23:40.292
The subject is closed.

23:40.294 --> 23:42.494
Okay?

23:48.134 --> 23:52.103
Where the hell is Danny Reagan?

23:52.105 --> 23:53.471
Right here,
Chief.

23:53.473 --> 23:55.273
Pleasure to meet you, Detective.
You, too.

23:56.042 --> 23:56.741
How's your dad?
He's well.

23:56.743 --> 23:57.842
Sends his best.

23:57.844 --> 24:00.145
Jerry Demarest.
Hiya, Jerry.

24:00.147 --> 24:01.560
So, uh, you guys
want coffee?

24:01.561 --> 24:03.299
Uh, we can send out
if you're hungry.

24:03.299 --> 24:05.517
No, we're great.
All right.

24:05.519 --> 24:08.053
Jerry's partner was the
detective who intervened.

24:08.055 --> 24:09.354
That was
your partner?

24:09.356 --> 24:11.056
Yeah.

24:11.058 --> 24:12.324
Riding with a fairy.

24:12.326 --> 24:14.192
What's that like?

24:14.194 --> 24:15.034
"If you resist arrest,

24:15.035 --> 24:16.475
I'm going to give you
such a pinch."

24:16.475 --> 24:20.166
Fuentes is actually a
highly decorated detective.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.133
Well, they do
like decorating.

24:23.604 --> 24:25.924
Detective Fuentes also happened
to save his partner's life.

24:26.105 --> 24:27.973
Yeah, he did.

24:30.309 --> 24:33.245
Kellin, inside.

24:39.385 --> 24:41.686
This is one of my
detectives, Billy Kellin.

24:42.255 --> 24:43.221
This is Danny
Reagan

24:43.223 --> 24:45.991
and Jerry Demarest.
Hey. Nice to meet you.

24:45.993 --> 24:48.994
Okay, so, what do you got
on the baseball bat?

24:48.996 --> 24:50.695
Uh, no prints of value.

24:50.697 --> 24:53.594
I sent some of my guys
over to the high school

24:53.595 --> 24:55.694
to look into number 51.
They're checkin' his alibi.

24:55.694 --> 24:59.005
And how about 51s
going back a few years?

24:59.006 --> 25:01.139
That's good thinking.

25:01.141 --> 25:03.341
Uh, Billy'll run that down for you.
Great.

25:04.210 --> 25:05.650
Yeah, I'll get started
on that today,

25:05.911 --> 25:06.611
but, uh, I'm off tomorrow, so...

25:06.846 --> 25:08.380
Oh.

25:10.683 --> 25:12.183
Go back, say, ten years.

25:12.785 --> 25:13.652
Oh, actually,

25:13.654 --> 25:15.186
you know, yeah,
I'll come in tomorrow.

25:15.454 --> 25:16.488
Good.

25:16.490 --> 25:18.223
Thanks.

25:26.465 --> 25:28.667
Okay.

25:30.236 --> 25:32.637
- Guess we'll head back to the city, then.
- Hey.

25:33.339 --> 25:34.906
You give my best
to your old man.

25:34.908 --> 25:37.042
I'll do just that.

25:39.812 --> 25:42.180
You know, I get Chief Monroe

25:42.182 --> 25:44.088
wanting to come in
and bend over backwards,

25:44.088 --> 25:45.440
being he's a friend
of my old man and all.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.512
But this Billy Kellin
wanting to come in

25:47.513 --> 25:49.028
on his day off to help us?

25:49.028 --> 25:50.656
What the hell
happened

25:50.657 --> 25:53.291
to the usual resentment
of two NYPD detectives

25:53.293 --> 25:56.394
storming into the squad room
in East Cupcake, New Jersey?

25:56.396 --> 25:58.330
And all that for an assault case?

25:58.597 --> 25:59.264
Exactly.

25:59.266 --> 26:00.432
Reagan.

26:00.434 --> 26:01.466
What?

26:01.468 --> 26:03.335
Hold on.

26:05.338 --> 26:06.338
Yeah, all right.

26:06.340 --> 26:08.073
It's not an assault
case anymore.

26:09.041 --> 26:09.774
Martin Elvers just died
on the operating table.

26:10.409 --> 26:11.409
Now it's a
homicide.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.289
Come on, Greg, give me a break.

26:23.291 --> 26:24.862
You and I have talked for hours

26:24.862 --> 26:27.126
about ways the Church
needs to reform.

26:27.128 --> 26:28.394
Yes, Frank...

26:28.396 --> 26:30.830
alone, in private,
just between us men.

26:30.832 --> 26:32.532
I'm sure you and Henry
have said things

26:33.233 --> 26:34.500
about the population
you police

26:34.502 --> 26:36.626
you wouldn't want released for
public consumption. Come on.

26:36.627 --> 26:38.371
What do you want from me here?

26:39.039 --> 26:40.540
I want you to issue an apology.

26:40.542 --> 26:41.741
I can't do that.

26:41.762 --> 26:42.762
Of course you can.

26:43.110 --> 26:44.010
I do believe

26:44.012 --> 26:45.444
the Church is backwards on this.

26:46.280 --> 26:48.180
And of all the stands
to hold onto,

26:48.182 --> 26:51.050
in the midst of the scandals
of the past decades...

26:51.052 --> 26:54.020
That is not up to you or me.

26:54.022 --> 26:56.556
The faith we keep is in our Lord

26:56.558 --> 26:58.758
and the infallibility
of the Vatican

26:58.760 --> 27:00.059
and her tenets.

27:00.061 --> 27:02.128
Greg, the Pope himself

27:02.130 --> 27:04.397
has begun to move
the needle on this.

27:05.198 --> 27:06.332
The catechism of
the Catholic Church

27:06.334 --> 27:08.501
remains firm on
the matter, Frank.

27:10.304 --> 27:12.672
Is there an "or else" here?

27:12.674 --> 27:15.975
I mean...
is excommunication on the table?

27:15.977 --> 27:17.810
Oh, Frank, be serious.

27:17.812 --> 27:20.012
Well, honestly,
I forgot the criteria.

27:20.014 --> 27:22.982
Well, rest assured,
you haven't met it.

27:22.984 --> 27:25.851
But I might be dis-invited

27:25.853 --> 27:28.721
from the Trinity
dinner chairmanship

27:28.723 --> 27:31.390
and any attendant
consideration to St. Dom's

27:31.392 --> 27:35.061
that my participation
might have brought?

27:41.034 --> 27:45.037
The public nature of my remark

27:45.039 --> 27:47.406
was unfortunate.

27:49.176 --> 27:52.111
I could issue a statement

27:52.113 --> 27:56.248
expressing regret
for the context.

27:59.853 --> 28:03.089
I've taken up
enough of your time.

28:19.272 --> 28:20.673
Thank you, Frank.

28:20.675 --> 28:21.874
You're a good friend.

28:33.954 --> 28:35.921
Hey.

28:35.923 --> 28:37.790
Hey.

28:37.792 --> 28:39.158
Were you able?

28:39.160 --> 28:41.494
Yeah, I dug up the warrant.

28:41.496 --> 28:45.798
So your Spideyboy is
actually Davey Lugo.

28:45.800 --> 28:49.869
Lives at 946
Washington Place Apartment 5D.

28:49.871 --> 28:51.771
Warrant's good
until Wednesday.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.139
I really
appreciate it.

28:53.141 --> 28:55.441
Yeah, well, you didn't
hear it from me.

28:55.809 --> 28:57.543
Nope, I know.

28:57.545 --> 28:59.545
So, I've done
business with Hoffman.

28:59.547 --> 29:00.813
He's a good
detective.

29:00.815 --> 29:02.615
Why did he steal
your collar?

29:03.450 --> 29:04.884
We graduated from
the academy together.

29:04.886 --> 29:06.419
He was second
in the class.

29:07.287 --> 29:08.727
So he just has it
out for number one?

29:09.256 --> 29:10.423
I don't know
what his problem is.

29:10.425 --> 29:13.325
But he made detective
and you haven't yet,

29:13.327 --> 29:15.461
so maybe you have the
same kind of problem.

29:15.796 --> 29:17.129
Maybe I do.

29:17.131 --> 29:18.497
But I play by the rules.

29:18.832 --> 29:19.632
Until now.

29:19.634 --> 29:21.634
Fire with fire.

29:21.636 --> 29:23.803
Or two wrongs
not making a right.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.438
Do you always get the last word?

29:25.772 --> 29:26.772
Yes, I do.

29:27.641 --> 29:29.875
Sir.

29:37.150 --> 29:38.617
Got a minute?

29:38.619 --> 29:40.453
You know, two knocks
is kind of the minimum.

29:41.054 --> 29:43.355
You never close your door.

29:47.127 --> 29:50.229
I kind of went off-road
at the press conference.

29:50.231 --> 29:52.364
You kind of drove into a ditch.

29:55.135 --> 29:56.836
I am trying to construct

29:56.838 --> 29:58.804
a statement that

29:58.806 --> 30:02.241
neutralizes my criticism
of the Church

30:02.243 --> 30:06.445
without appearing to
walk back what I said...

30:08.048 --> 30:09.749
...and not sound
like I'm talking

30:09.852 --> 30:11.250
out of both sides
of my mouth.

30:11.352 --> 30:13.873
This sounds like you're talking
out of both sides of your mouth.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.454
Then there's that.

30:15.456 --> 30:18.023
I can do better than this.

30:18.025 --> 30:19.892
Could you?

30:19.894 --> 30:22.561
I can't be sure it'll
completely satisfy both sides.

30:22.563 --> 30:25.164
It has to.

30:27.667 --> 30:28.868
I will try.

30:28.870 --> 30:31.670
Please try hard.

30:32.739 --> 30:34.140
This is important
to you, isn't it?

30:35.609 --> 30:38.344
Yes, it is.

30:46.853 --> 30:48.020
Got something.

30:48.022 --> 30:49.822
What?

30:49.824 --> 30:51.457
A bank camera
caught the SUV

30:51.549 --> 30:52.831
rounding the corner
from the scene,

30:52.832 --> 30:54.393
we got a partial plate.

30:54.395 --> 30:56.228
I crossed that
with EZ pass records

30:56.260 --> 30:57.666
from cars coming in that day,

30:58.532 --> 31:01.267
and there's a Todd Kowalchuk
of River Glen

31:01.269 --> 31:03.169
with four out of the six
numbers on the plate.

31:03.937 --> 31:05.704
Beautiful. Let's go.
Where?

31:05.706 --> 31:07.540
We're going to go scout
the River Glen football teams.

31:07.812 --> 31:08.542
Come on, get off your ass.

31:08.809 --> 31:09.842
Yeah.

31:18.151 --> 31:21.387
Todd Kowalchuk,
class of 2008.

31:21.389 --> 31:23.055
He's our driver.

31:23.057 --> 31:25.724
Outside linebacker
Todd Kowalchuk.

31:25.726 --> 31:27.259
Number 51.
Uh-huh.

31:27.261 --> 31:28.427
We found him.

31:30.564 --> 31:32.565
Son of a bitch.
Look at this.

31:32.567 --> 31:33.599
Huh?

31:33.601 --> 31:34.601
Middle linebacker.

31:34.602 --> 31:36.202
Kevin Monroe.

31:36.204 --> 31:38.204
The chief's son?

31:38.206 --> 31:40.706
I'd bet the farm and all
the animals on it.

31:40.708 --> 31:42.708
I'm going through their
senior portraits right now.

31:42.810 --> 31:44.210
Do me a favor.

31:45.078 --> 31:46.979
Cough, okay?

31:46.981 --> 31:48.914
What?
Just cough.

31:52.186 --> 31:53.485
Do it again.

31:55.089 --> 31:57.523
We got to show these to Fuentes.

31:57.525 --> 31:59.091
Get him to make a positive I.D.

31:59.195 --> 32:01.436
But first we need
to get their guard down.

32:11.872 --> 32:13.239
Danny, how's it going?

32:13.241 --> 32:14.273
Chief.

32:14.275 --> 32:16.041
Just wanted to come by
and say thanks.

32:16.077 --> 32:18.237
And to let you know that
we'll be out of your hair now.

32:18.578 --> 32:19.879
You got the guys?

32:19.881 --> 32:23.349
Well, no. We got conflicting
eyewitness testimony.

32:23.351 --> 32:26.151
One says they're Jersey plates,
one says New York plates.

32:26.153 --> 32:28.721
One says number 51,
the other says number 15.

32:28.723 --> 32:30.990
But what we do know is
that there's a River Glen

32:31.136 --> 32:33.434
in Putnam County, New York,
and we can place

32:33.434 --> 32:35.495
two former football players
in the West Village

32:35.496 --> 32:37.796
the night of the incident,
so there you go.

32:37.998 --> 32:39.231
Wow.

32:39.233 --> 32:41.767
Yeah. Sorry to be a bother.

32:41.769 --> 32:43.402
No, no, no. Not at all.

32:43.670 --> 32:44.370
Anytime.

32:44.372 --> 32:45.905
Hey.

32:45.907 --> 32:48.207
Did you say hey
to your old man for me?

32:49.409 --> 32:51.809
Oh, well, I plan on catching him
up on his old pal real soon.

33:02.609 --> 33:05.243
Anyone who steps into a fight
involving two mooks

33:05.245 --> 33:07.926
with baseball bats
can't be a sissy in my book.

33:07.927 --> 33:09.208
Aw, Pop! "Sissy"?

33:09.232 --> 33:09.804
The thing is.

33:09.828 --> 33:10.828
What?

33:11.212 --> 33:12.474
Who are we talking about?

33:12.688 --> 33:14.638
I think gay guy dad
was talking about in the car.

33:14.662 --> 33:15.782
Wow. Whoa.

33:15.806 --> 33:19.287
Mickey, ketchup, that
your father was speaking of.

33:19.311 --> 33:20.350
The gay detective.

33:20.374 --> 33:21.739
No. It's just detective

33:21.740 --> 33:22.539
Nicky?

33:22.541 --> 33:24.475
I was paying the man
a compliment.

33:24.477 --> 33:26.176
But "sissy"? Seriously?

33:26.178 --> 33:28.712
Okay. what would
young people call it?

33:28.714 --> 33:30.714
Call what?
What we're talking about.

33:30.716 --> 33:31.949
You mean gay?

33:31.951 --> 33:32.916
Yeah, gay.

33:35.287 --> 33:37.821
Well, I'm only in fifth grade,
so it doesn't come up very much.

33:38.790 --> 33:40.257
They kind of kidnapped
that word, you ask me.

33:40.259 --> 33:41.725
Nobody asked you, Pop.

33:41.727 --> 33:43.260
It's not even accurate.

33:43.262 --> 33:47.197
I mean, gay is
"happy and lighthearted."

33:47.199 --> 33:49.333
It doesn't mean that anymore.

33:49.335 --> 33:51.068
As you well know, Pop, come on.

33:51.669 --> 33:52.669
Well, it was a good word.

33:53.605 --> 33:55.939
It still is just with a
different connotation.

33:55.941 --> 33:58.442
So, was it just me...

33:58.444 --> 34:01.945
or was monsignor really zeroing
in on you during his sermon.

34:01.947 --> 34:04.641
Yeah, I noticed that, too,
when he was talking about

34:04.828 --> 34:07.528
Sunday Catholics as opposed
to every single day Catholics.

34:07.619 --> 34:10.353
A reserved pew up front
is a blessing and a curse.

34:10.356 --> 34:12.623
I thought you were gonna
issue an apology

34:12.625 --> 34:16.485
for shooting your mouth off
about the Church and the gays.

34:16.485 --> 34:18.128
I use it right that time?

34:18.129 --> 34:18.829
I told His Eminence

34:18.831 --> 34:20.831
I would.
Apparently I am guilty

34:20.833 --> 34:24.067
of heresy until the apology
is actually released.

34:24.069 --> 34:25.502
Which is when?

34:25.504 --> 34:27.137
Which is after I've written it.

34:29.808 --> 34:32.943
That was delicious.

34:32.945 --> 34:34.478
What's for dessert?

34:34.480 --> 34:35.913
Humble pie.

34:35.915 --> 34:38.047
Then I'm full.

34:43.087 --> 34:45.289
- This guy...
Uh-huh.

34:45.291 --> 34:46.989
and this one.

34:46.992 --> 34:48.759
He was the one with the bat.

34:49.427 --> 34:50.860
You sure about that?
100%.

34:50.862 --> 34:52.596
All right then.
We're good to go.

34:53.297 --> 34:54.750
So, what happens now?
Well,

34:54.750 --> 34:56.817
Kowalchuk and Monroe
are partners

34:56.819 --> 34:58.752
in an exterminator business
in River Glen.

34:59.187 --> 35:00.454
Okay.
So...

35:00.456 --> 35:03.390
we have an appointment for them
to assess our termite problem

35:03.392 --> 35:04.992
tomorrow in Vandergoes Township.

35:04.994 --> 35:07.394
Okay.
Vandergoes Township

35:07.396 --> 35:09.296
is the neighboring town
to River Glen

35:09.831 --> 35:10.698
and also happens to fall

35:10.700 --> 35:12.533
on our side of the
New York state line

35:12.667 --> 35:14.028
where Chief Monroe
can't help them.

35:14.402 --> 35:15.336
When's the appointment?

35:15.338 --> 35:16.770
Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

35:16.929 --> 35:19.540
Maybe you and your, uh, partner
would like to join us?

35:19.975 --> 35:21.141
Sure.
Fuentes?

35:21.143 --> 35:23.577
It's up to him.

35:31.853 --> 35:34.655
You'll join us.

35:51.273 --> 35:53.593
Out of the vehicle with your
hands in the air now! Come on!

35:54.075 --> 35:55.943
Get your hands against the car.

35:57.979 --> 36:00.247
I'm Detective Reagan
with the NYPD.

36:00.249 --> 36:02.349
You're under arrest for
accessory to murder

36:02.351 --> 36:03.717
of Martin Elvers.
You hear me?

36:03.771 --> 36:05.291
Never heard of him.
And this is Jersey.

36:05.471 --> 36:06.920
You got
no jurisdiction here...

36:06.922 --> 36:09.089
Hey! You just crossed the line
into New York, jackass.

36:10.392 --> 36:12.760
It's gonna be your home for a
while, so I'd get used to it.

36:13.762 --> 36:15.629
Demarest, let Fuentes
do the honors with him.

36:15.631 --> 36:17.531
You take this schmuck.

36:17.533 --> 36:18.799
Come on.
Hey!

36:18.801 --> 36:20.901
Kevin Monroe,
you are under arrest

36:20.903 --> 36:22.670
for the murder of Martin Elvers.

36:22.672 --> 36:24.738
Hey, Reagan, Baez?

36:24.740 --> 36:28.208
You mind if Fuentes and I take
these guys in for booking?

36:30.111 --> 36:31.578
They're your collar.
You earned it.

36:32.147 --> 36:33.147
Go on, get out of here.

36:33.448 --> 36:35.482
Come on!

36:35.484 --> 36:38.152
You got one hell of a
partner there, Demarest.

36:38.154 --> 36:39.620
Guess I do.

36:39.622 --> 36:40.721
You miss me?

36:40.723 --> 36:42.656
A little.

36:42.658 --> 36:43.957
More than a little.

36:43.959 --> 36:46.493
No, really, just a little.

36:46.495 --> 36:47.961
Mm-hmm.

36:58.006 --> 37:00.207
Good evening, Sister.

37:01.076 --> 37:02.309
I'm, uh...

37:02.311 --> 37:04.845
sorry to keep you waiting.

37:04.847 --> 37:06.146
Busy day.

37:06.148 --> 37:09.149
How did it go with His Eminence?

37:11.920 --> 37:14.555
I'm afraid I failed you.

37:15.657 --> 37:16.824
What the hell happened?

37:16.826 --> 37:20.094
Pop, the sister needs another

37:20.096 --> 37:23.297
cube of ice in her drink
and I could use one myself.

37:27.001 --> 37:29.203
I can take a hint.

37:31.039 --> 37:35.042
I butted heads
with the Archdiocese last week.

37:35.044 --> 37:36.410
When you shot off your mouth

37:36.441 --> 37:38.412
about the Church's
stance on homosexuality.

37:38.414 --> 37:39.580
Yes.

37:39.582 --> 37:40.848
I read the papers.

37:40.850 --> 37:42.049
I regret it.

37:42.051 --> 37:44.551
I shouldn't have
answered the question.

37:46.121 --> 37:47.821
But I have been asked

37:47.823 --> 37:50.224
to issue a public apology.

37:50.226 --> 37:52.860
And you can't do that?

37:52.862 --> 37:55.529
Well, I tried.

37:55.531 --> 37:57.731
But then I realized
that any apology,

37:57.733 --> 38:01.034
no matter how carefully
worded and qualified,

38:01.036 --> 38:02.736
would come off

38:02.738 --> 38:06.173
as me recanting my objection.

38:07.075 --> 38:09.443
And I couldn't do that.

38:10.678 --> 38:13.113
I see.

38:13.115 --> 38:15.516
I don't expect you to.

38:16.918 --> 38:18.719
Oh, I'm sure there
will be another way

38:19.320 --> 38:21.221
to keep St. Dom's open.

38:21.223 --> 38:23.357
Are you? Really?

38:23.359 --> 38:24.458
Well, with

38:24.460 --> 38:25.993
all due respect, my faith

38:25.995 --> 38:27.661
is in Our Lord first.

38:27.663 --> 38:29.530
You second.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.566
Please try to understand.

38:32.568 --> 38:36.236
I command 35,000 men and women.

38:36.238 --> 38:38.672
I have no idea how many are gay

38:38.674 --> 38:40.874
or lesbian or whatever.

38:40.876 --> 38:42.709
I don't want to know.

38:42.711 --> 38:45.579
I don't need to know.

38:45.581 --> 38:49.316
And I won't condemn them
because I'm a Catholic.

38:49.318 --> 38:51.785
It's none of my damn business.

38:53.955 --> 38:56.190
Commissioner,

38:56.192 --> 39:00.561
the day I entered
the convent started

39:00.563 --> 39:04.598
on the train platform
in Madison, Wisconsin,

39:04.600 --> 39:08.569
where I kissed
my girlfriend good-bye.

39:11.606 --> 39:17.444
Now, there's not a day I regret
answering our Lord's call,

39:17.446 --> 39:21.715
or a day when I'm ashamed
of who I was before.

39:21.717 --> 39:24.451
So, thank you.

39:27.889 --> 39:30.357
So, how did you screw up
with His Eminence?

39:47.976 --> 39:49.276
What the hell?

39:49.278 --> 39:50.377
David Lugo.

39:50.379 --> 39:51.778
No.
Don't move.

39:51.780 --> 39:53.514
Where do you think
you're going?

39:53.516 --> 39:54.882
We are officers
of the NYPD.

39:55.170 --> 39:56.049
I have here a warrant

39:56.087 --> 39:57.728
to search these premises
for stolen goods.

39:58.386 --> 39:59.820
The search was
hugely successful.

39:59.822 --> 40:01.255
On your knees.

40:01.257 --> 40:03.991
Hands behind
your head.

40:03.993 --> 40:05.492
Let's roll,
Spiderboy.

40:13.401 --> 40:15.235
Why aren't we booking
him downstairs?

40:15.237 --> 40:16.637
'Cause he's
not our collar.

40:16.805 --> 40:17.938
The hell are you
talking about?

40:17.959 --> 40:19.060
The whole point of
this thing is...

40:19.061 --> 40:20.340
To get even.

40:20.342 --> 40:22.142
Here, hold him.

40:24.045 --> 40:26.280
Hey, Detective Hoffman.

40:26.282 --> 40:27.814
Reagan.

40:27.816 --> 40:29.349
What the hell?

40:29.351 --> 40:32.653
We have here one David Lugo,
aka Spiderboy.

40:32.655 --> 40:35.689
We executed a warrant
to search his residence

40:35.691 --> 40:36.924
for stolen property,

40:36.926 --> 40:39.326
which turned up some
very positive results.

40:39.328 --> 40:43.230
So, we placed Mr. Lugo under
arrest for said stolen property,

40:43.232 --> 40:46.166
but were made aware
that Mr. Lugo was the subject

40:46.168 --> 40:48.635
of an ongoing investigation
by the detective.

40:48.637 --> 40:53.173
So, in the spirit of the
ancient and solemn brotherhood

40:53.175 --> 40:56.243
of the NYPD, here's your collar.

41:01.727 --> 41:03.061
Hey.

41:03.063 --> 41:04.496
Screw you, Reagan.

41:04.498 --> 41:06.364
You're welcome, Mike.
