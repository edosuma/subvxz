WEBVTT

00:00.750 --> 00:03.920
- Okay... here goes.

00:04.003 --> 00:06.923
Hmm, you're a pretty thick one.

00:07.006 --> 00:08.048
Where to start?
(gasps)

00:16.015 --> 00:19.728
"Temporal Machination
and Modification."

00:21.354 --> 00:23.440
Time manipulation...

00:23.523 --> 00:25.525
This is it!
It's going to work!

00:28.194 --> 00:29.904
Jax... I found it!

00:32.949 --> 00:34.033
- What is it?

00:34.117 --> 00:35.034
- Here.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.662
It's called a...
Tam-bi-an Orb.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.081
- "An ancient mechanism

00:40.165 --> 00:41.040
used to control
time and space."

00:42.959 --> 00:44.085
Okay, this looks
pretty hard,

00:44.169 --> 00:45.295
but I'm sure
if we can find the time

00:45.378 --> 00:46.421
we can figure it out--

00:47.338 --> 00:49.674
Wait--
you want to do this now?

00:49.758 --> 00:50.175
Like right now?

00:56.681 --> 00:58.266
"We summon forward
and summon back

00:58.349 --> 01:00.351
to find the things
that we do lack."

01:03.605 --> 01:06.232
- "To use the orb
to manipulate time and space,

01:06.316 --> 01:08.151
a witch must possess
immense power."

01:11.237 --> 01:13.615
- Desdemona
and Agamemnon's powers.

01:13.698 --> 01:15.158
These should be
immense enough.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.076
- Wait, Em-- have you
thought about this?

01:18.369 --> 01:19.537
I guess so.

01:20.747 --> 01:21.998
- "I shall go to any length

01:22.081 --> 01:24.125
to give myself
great powers and strength."

01:28.922 --> 01:30.173
There's no going back now.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.136
It's working!

01:36.679 --> 01:39.140
- So this ball is just supposed
to bring your mom back?

01:39.224 --> 01:42.393
- No... it's not that simple.

01:42.477 --> 01:45.772
The orb has enough power
to alter the Earth's rotation.

01:45.855 --> 01:48.191
Then because of the law
of angular momentum--

01:48.274 --> 01:51.402
- Ooh, science...
you know that's not my thing.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.029
- I'm going to turn back time

01:53.112 --> 01:55.824
by spinning
the entire Earth backwards

01:55.907 --> 01:58.368
until I reach the time
when my mom was alive.

- Wait, Em.

02:49.002 --> 02:49.836
- What?

02:49.919 --> 02:50.962
- If you go back in time

02:51.045 --> 02:52.255
to when that picture
was taken,

02:52.338 --> 02:53.590
who will you be?

02:53.673 --> 02:55.425
Will you be this Emma?

02:55.508 --> 02:56.801
Or will you be baby Emma?

02:56.885 --> 02:58.761
Will you be the Emma
that likes pizza...

02:58.845 --> 03:00.513
or will you be the Emma
that likes mud pie?

03:00.597 --> 03:02.807
- Mud pie?

03:02.891 --> 03:04.684
- I don't know,
isn't that what kids eat?

03:04.767 --> 03:05.935
- I'm not sure.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.396
I guess,
for a brief moment...

03:08.479 --> 03:09.939
both Emmas will exist.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.065
- What if you go back in time

03:11.149 --> 03:12.775
and you don't have
your powers?

03:12.859 --> 03:13.818
You'll be a kid and, and...

03:13.902 --> 03:16.112
you won't know me.

03:16.195 --> 03:17.280
- I think I can fix
the time jumps.

03:17.363 --> 03:18.990
I'll go back
to before she was sick,

03:19.073 --> 03:21.451
adjust only that wrinkle
in time,

03:21.534 --> 03:22.201
and jump back
with nothing else changed.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.464
- No!

03:34.547 --> 03:35.965
- What's happening?

03:36.049 --> 03:37.300
- I don't know!

03:39.844 --> 03:41.804
JAX: Did it work?

03:41.888 --> 03:43.514
Are we both in the past?

03:46.851 --> 03:47.936
Why is it so dark in here?!

03:48.019 --> 03:50.146
EMMA: Sorry, Dad!

03:50.229 --> 03:52.023
We're working
on a science project.

03:52.106 --> 03:53.942
See? Transfer
of electrical currents.

03:54.025 --> 03:57.320
- Oh, electrical currents.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.529
My favorite type
of current!

03:58.613 --> 04:00.990
Well-- I hope you at least
learned something.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.575
- Oh, yeah, heaps.

04:02.659 --> 04:03.743
The beauty of science!

04:03.826 --> 04:04.744
- Are you okay?

04:04.827 --> 04:07.497
- Oh, I'm fine.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.624
Nothing a little ice and, uh,

04:09.707 --> 04:12.502
some spaghetti
and tuna salad won't fix.

04:12.585 --> 04:13.836
Dinner's ready
in fifteen.

04:13.920 --> 04:14.837
(chuckles)

04:14.921 --> 04:15.964
Ow...

04:16.839 --> 04:18.257
- I don't think I can do it.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.676
- Yeah-- that's a rough one.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.344
I mean, I like spaghetti
and tuna,

04:21.427 --> 04:23.221
but separately,
you know what I mean?

04:23.304 --> 04:25.515
- I meant the spell.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.517
I don't think
I'm powerful enough.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.602
Yet.

04:35.692 --> 04:36.275
- Emma!

04:36.359 --> 04:38.194
My bags are all packed.

04:38.277 --> 04:40.071
I'll be ready to roll
in just a second.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.448
- Oh, okay...

04:42.532 --> 04:44.325
Sorry, where are you
rolling to?

04:44.409 --> 04:46.536
- Back home...
to the 'Glades.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.788
- I can't send you back
to the Everglades yet.

04:48.871 --> 04:51.207
- But you found something...
didn't you?

04:51.290 --> 04:53.543
- She thought she did,
it just--

04:53.626 --> 04:54.544
just didn't pan out.

04:54.627 --> 04:55.503
- But you're close, right?

04:55.586 --> 04:58.006
- Maybe--
look, can we talk later?

04:58.089 --> 04:59.257
I really need to go.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.092
- Wait!

05:01.175 --> 05:02.385
- She said that she has to go.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.971
It's gonna have to wait
a bit longer.

05:05.054 --> 05:06.472
- A bit longer?

05:06.556 --> 05:07.682
Does "a bit longer"

05:07.765 --> 05:09.726
mean the same in Australia
as it does here?

05:11.102 --> 05:11.978
- Ooh, perfect.

05:12.061 --> 05:13.271
Just the person
I was looking for.

05:13.354 --> 05:14.397
- (sighs)
You too?

05:14.480 --> 05:16.983
- Okay, I know that this
is a weird question

05:17.066 --> 05:17.942
but just go with it.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.570
Can you smell me?

05:20.653 --> 05:23.906
- You mean... right now?

05:23.990 --> 05:26.367
- Like, can you sense my odor
from super far away?

05:26.451 --> 05:27.452
And would you consider it...

05:28.703 --> 05:31.372
stinky?

05:31.456 --> 05:35.501
- Uh-- in general
you smell fine to me?

05:35.585 --> 05:37.837
Sure, after a couple hours
working the pizza oven

05:37.920 --> 05:40.173
you might not be the freshest,
but who would be?

05:40.256 --> 05:42.967
- No, he's talking about--

05:44.719 --> 05:47.597
You know how some witches
say Kanays have a certain...

05:47.680 --> 05:50.600
- I think the word you're
looking for is "stank."

05:50.683 --> 05:52.769
- There are certain witches,
who have this sense

05:52.852 --> 05:57.190
where they can smell Kanay
<i>aroma</i> from super far away.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.566
- Diego, that's really
interesting,

05:58.649 --> 05:59.609
but I'm kind of in the middle
of something important.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.903
- As important
as trying to figure out

06:01.986 --> 06:03.613
if you're one of
the last remaining members

06:03.696 --> 06:04.614
of a soon-to-be-extinct
species?

06:04.697 --> 06:07.033
- Yes.

06:07.116 --> 06:08.451
- Oh, okay.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.620
That is not the response
I was expecting.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.580
Just give me
a second here to regroup...

06:12.663 --> 06:14.874
- Look, you don't need my help.

06:14.957 --> 06:16.793
You're a Kanay
and Maddie's a witch.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.127
You have great powers.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.171
Use them to find
what you're looking for.

06:20.254 --> 06:21.547
- Let's go, Proxy.

06:21.631 --> 06:22.673
I knew she couldn't help.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.968
- She has powers...

06:26.052 --> 06:28.888
Maddie has powers...
Wait!

06:28.971 --> 06:32.266
On second thought,
I just might be able to help.

06:32.350 --> 06:33.684
DIEGO: Really?

06:33.768 --> 06:35.520
- Meet me in the biology lab
after school.

06:39.273 --> 06:41.067
- More Maddie? Really?

06:41.150 --> 06:42.151
I've spent so much time

06:42.235 --> 06:43.820
cooped up with her
for the past week.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.363
- But she could be useful.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.240
She's a witch.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.158
- Yes... I know.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.952
- She has powers...

06:51.035 --> 06:52.245
- Yes... I know...

06:52.328 --> 06:54.372
- And I need powers...

06:54.455 --> 06:54.914
- What are you talking about?

06:54.997 --> 06:59.168
Wha-- Oh...!

06:59.252 --> 07:02.380
Emma... she's not gonna
give you her powers.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.173
- Maybe not.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.468
But I could borrow them
without her noticing.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.514
- And how is this gonna help?

07:11.597 --> 07:13.266
- I have a Kanay Sense.

07:13.349 --> 07:14.600
You don't.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.728
But...I can transfer
the sense to you.

07:17.812 --> 07:20.773
- Um, I don't see a ginormous
ball of scrap metal!

07:20.857 --> 07:23.234
How do you expect to do
the transfer of powers if--

07:24.527 --> 07:26.696
Wait, no way!

07:26.779 --> 07:27.446
Proxy can't be our proxy.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.323
It's too dangerous.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.199
- Relax.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.910
New reading material.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.287
According to this...

07:36.164 --> 07:37.206
All you have to do

07:37.290 --> 07:38.166
is read the spell
while we hold hands

07:38.249 --> 07:40.293
and the transfer will work.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.925
"Through day and night
and endless hours,

07:48.009 --> 07:50.303
I hereby grant
this transfer of powers."

07:53.097 --> 07:53.472
- Did it work?

07:56.225 --> 07:57.685
- I...

07:58.186 --> 07:59.520
(sniffing)

07:59.604 --> 08:02.398
- You sense
something already?

08:02.481 --> 08:04.150
- I think so, but...

08:04.233 --> 08:05.109
(sniffing)

08:05.193 --> 08:07.236
But it's not you.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.362
- (gasps)
It's another Kanay.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.156
- (sniffing)

08:10.239 --> 08:11.449
It's...

08:11.532 --> 08:12.450
(sniffing)

08:12.533 --> 08:13.576
It's...

08:15.077 --> 08:16.621
a tuna sandwich?

08:16.704 --> 08:19.040
- Oh, hey! I've been looking
for that... mmm...

08:21.334 --> 08:22.710
- Home sweet home!

08:37.225 --> 08:39.393
JAX: (chuckles)

08:41.437 --> 08:43.438
(both sigh)

08:43.522 --> 08:45.524
I think you were
really close that time.

08:45.608 --> 08:46.817
- I don't get it.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.903
Is it possible
that I still need more power?

08:53.449 --> 08:55.785
Maybe I should just forget it.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.411
- No...

08:57.495 --> 08:57.787
Take my powers.

08:57.870 --> 08:58.788
- What?

08:58.871 --> 09:00.873
No.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.625
Jax, you need your powers.

09:02.708 --> 09:03.709
- I'll be fine without them.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.253
You need them
more than I do.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.170
- No way. You need to protect
your mom and your sister.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.130
They're both powerless.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.258
I'd never forgive myself

09:10.341 --> 09:11.926
if anything happened
to any of you.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.052
- I'll be fine.

09:13.135 --> 09:14.512
Trust me,
I can handle myself.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.472
I can even tie my own
shoelaces, which is

09:16.555 --> 09:19.267
much more than I can say
for the Council.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.101
- No.

09:20.184 --> 09:21.769
I'm not taking them, Jax.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.396
That's that.
(phone beeps)

09:25.064 --> 09:26.232
I need to go.

09:29.068 --> 09:32.154
But Jax...

09:32.238 --> 09:32.613
Thank you.

09:37.618 --> 09:40.037
Mom? Are you spying
on Jax again?

09:40.121 --> 09:41.163
- Oh... Jessie!

09:41.247 --> 09:44.292
No-- I was just--
I thought I heard a--

09:44.375 --> 09:45.543
a squirrel--
in the walls.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.003
(boom echoes)

09:47.086 --> 09:49.505
- That is one serious squirrel.

09:49.588 --> 09:51.674
- Go to your room...
and stay there. Now!

09:54.593 --> 09:58.139
(boom)

09:58.222 --> 09:59.432
It's your father.

09:59.515 --> 10:01.434
He's trying to get in.
- Where's Jessie?

10:01.517 --> 10:03.436
- Her room.
Is the system engaged?

10:06.230 --> 10:07.606
Yep. Whole system is set.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.482
- And Emma's protective
bubble is up.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.192
He can't tele-transport in.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.193
We should be safe.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.446
(boom echoing)

10:13.529 --> 10:14.447
- I don't get it.

10:14.530 --> 10:15.781
Dad is totally harmless--

10:15.865 --> 10:18.242
boring sometimes,
but that never hurt anybody.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.368
- You think I'm boring, eh?

10:19.452 --> 10:21.203
- Dad!

10:21.287 --> 10:22.913
- Oh... We haven't got
a lot of time.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.290
And I need
to tell you something--

10:24.373 --> 10:25.416
<i>JAX: Jessie?!</i>

10:26.751 --> 10:28.044
<i>JAX: Jessie?!</i>

10:28.127 --> 10:29.420
- Why are you stopping?

10:29.503 --> 10:31.380
- I can't tele-transport.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.049
There's a protective bubble
around the house.

10:33.132 --> 10:33.758
- Quick, hide under my bed!

10:40.431 --> 10:41.390
- Jessie?

10:41.474 --> 10:43.559
Jessie, are you okay?

10:43.642 --> 10:44.644
- I'm okay.

10:44.727 --> 10:45.603
A-okay.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.104
A-plus okay.

10:47.188 --> 10:47.897
- All right then.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.690
Well, just, just stay here

10:49.774 --> 10:51.192
until I say everything's safe,
all right?

10:51.275 --> 10:52.735
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:57.782 --> 10:58.991
- He's gone.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.284
JAKE: Good work.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.370
But maybe fewer "okays"
next time.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.418
- So... how exactly does one

11:09.502 --> 11:13.839
get the water on the floor?

11:13.923 --> 11:15.883
- Oh! Like so.

11:20.971 --> 11:22.723
- I don't think that's right.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.266
- What do you know?

11:24.350 --> 11:25.559
You stick to doling out

11:25.643 --> 11:29.188
those little strips of
carbohydrates to children.

11:29.271 --> 11:32.942
- They're called French fries,
and I know plenty!

11:33.025 --> 11:34.151
- Ahh!

11:34.235 --> 11:36.862
How dare you try
to touch my...

11:36.946 --> 11:38.364
floor swatter!

11:38.447 --> 11:40.074
- Oh, give it to me!
- Stop that!

11:40.157 --> 11:42.410
Aah...

11:42.493 --> 11:43.619
- I don't see
why we can't have

11:43.702 --> 11:44.912
our after-school
Panther meetings

11:44.995 --> 11:46.080
at your house or The Seven.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.331
- Yeah, but then
it wouldn't be a meeting.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.583
It would just be us,

11:49.667 --> 11:51.627
hanging out,
talking about other people.

11:51.710 --> 11:52.795
- But all we do at our meetings

11:52.878 --> 11:55.965
is hang out
and talk about other people.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.634
- Yeah, but it's at a meeting.

11:58.717 --> 11:59.552
- Oh, no-- girls!

11:59.635 --> 12:01.721
Uh, no, what are they called?

12:01.804 --> 12:03.389
Pandas!
- Pan-THERS.

12:03.472 --> 12:05.141
(girls shriek)

12:06.517 --> 12:09.437
MADDIE: (groaning)

12:10.729 --> 12:13.732
(shoes squeaking)

12:21.115 --> 12:22.324
AGAMEMNON AND DESDEMONA: See
what you've done?!

12:22.408 --> 12:25.077
- Um... sorry, girls.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.370
Allow me.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.248
- That's okay.

12:29.331 --> 12:30.499
I love a good floor bath!

12:30.583 --> 12:32.877
Allow me.

12:36.797 --> 12:37.339
Hmm...

12:37.423 --> 12:39.842
That's weird.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.177
(clears throat)

12:41.260 --> 12:42.928
"I'll have to give this
another try.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.889
I'm soaking wet,
now make me dry."

12:45.306 --> 12:46.307
Wha--

12:46.390 --> 12:48.726
What's happening?

12:48.809 --> 12:51.729
My powers, they're...
they're not working!

12:51.812 --> 12:53.230
- Maybe the water
put them out!

12:55.524 --> 12:57.359
- My powers, they're...

12:57.443 --> 12:58.527
they're...

12:59.612 --> 13:00.905
gone!

13:17.171 --> 13:17.796
- Hello?

13:17.880 --> 13:19.381
DUPRE: Can I help you?

13:19.465 --> 13:20.382
- Who's there?

13:20.466 --> 13:22.218
DUPRE: (chuckles)

13:22.301 --> 13:23.511
It worked!

13:23.594 --> 13:25.346
Dupre's the name.

13:25.429 --> 13:26.722
- Daniel.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.098
- What brings ya
round these parts, Daniel?

13:28.182 --> 13:29.975
- I was wondering if you could
use any help around here.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.685
I'm familiar with the area,

13:31.769 --> 13:32.937
and I know my way
around an airboat.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.481
- Yeah, sure, I could
definitely use some help.

13:35.564 --> 13:38.526
Flamingos, they get kind of
restless this time of year.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.402
- Oh, I know.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.946
- Can't afford
to pay ya, though.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.864
- Oh, you won't have to.
Room and board is all I need.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.617
- Well, I ain't got no room...
or board.

13:46.700 --> 13:47.743
Sorry, stranger.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.537
- Please,
you don't understand.

13:49.620 --> 13:50.746
I live here!

13:50.829 --> 13:51.747
I did-- I do!

13:51.830 --> 13:52.831
This is my home!

13:54.333 --> 13:56.585
- You sure you weren't bit
by a rattler out there?

13:56.669 --> 13:58.087
- No, sir.
- You sure are showing

13:58.170 --> 13:59.463
all the classic symptoms.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.549
Talkin' nonsense, sweating...

14:01.632 --> 14:03.634
hair all crazy
from the venom.

14:03.717 --> 14:05.719
- This is how my hair is.

14:05.803 --> 14:08.222
- Well, I've been living here
for the last 30 years.

14:08.305 --> 14:12.643
And for 30 years before that,
my pa and grandpa lived here.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.019
- Wait...

14:14.103 --> 14:14.895
Is your last name
Miller?

14:14.979 --> 14:17.606
- Nope.
It's La Dupre.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.275
- Your name
is Dupre La Dupre?

14:19.358 --> 14:22.695
- Yup. So was my pa's
and my grandpa's.

14:22.778 --> 14:25.281
I'm Dupre La Dupre
the Third.

14:27.783 --> 14:29.451
LILY: Oh, hey, Andi.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.328
- Hey, Lily, I have
big news to tell you.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.830
Like really big.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.790
Huge! Gigantic!

14:34.873 --> 14:36.208
Galactic.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.293
- What is it?

14:37.376 --> 14:38.877
- Go ahead, Hex,
tell her what we heard.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.339
Can you believe it?!

14:44.049 --> 14:45.134
Oh, sorry...

14:45.217 --> 14:46.385
Emma found
a new book of spells.

14:46.468 --> 14:47.678
Like a bad one.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.972
Like an evil Hex!

14:50.055 --> 14:51.265
- Wait...
that could explain it!

14:51.348 --> 14:52.099
- Explain what?

14:52.182 --> 14:53.392
- How Maddie lost her powers.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.894
Emma must've found a spell
in there and stole them.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.062
MADDIE: What?!

14:59.773 --> 15:03.152
- Welcome to Lily's Hospital
of Powerless Witches.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.321
- Emma did this to me?!

15:05.404 --> 15:06.030
- Maddie, let's stay calm.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.990
- How can I stay calm?

15:08.073 --> 15:10.993
Do you not see
what my future looks like?

15:11.076 --> 15:13.329
- Desdemona, what happened
to the back of your head?

15:14.872 --> 15:17.124
Did a family of chipmunks
lay a nest in there?

15:24.715 --> 15:27.885
(snake hissing)

15:27.968 --> 15:31.013
- That sounds like a...
constrictor,

15:31.096 --> 15:32.556
roughly six, no... no, seven,

15:32.640 --> 15:34.099
seven feet long...

15:35.976 --> 15:36.685
Could it be?

15:36.769 --> 15:39.855
Billy-- Billy, is that you?

15:48.113 --> 15:49.490
I gotta get some sleep.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.909
Ah! Copperhead!

15:51.992 --> 15:52.993
They're venomous!

15:53.077 --> 15:54.703
Very venomous!

15:59.083 --> 16:00.876
- We need to get your things
and get out of here.

16:00.959 --> 16:02.419
You're gonna have to
pack light again.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.338
(groans)
- Dad!

16:06.590 --> 16:08.884
- What?!
How did you get in here?!

16:08.967 --> 16:10.844
- I walked
through the front door.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.221
- What-- We were so focused
on him sneaking in

16:12.304 --> 16:15.391
that we didn't even think
about the front door!

16:15.474 --> 16:17.017
- Let him out! Now!

16:17.101 --> 16:19.520
- Jessie... no.
You don't understand.

16:19.603 --> 16:20.979
- What is going on?

16:22.940 --> 16:23.607
We got him!

16:23.691 --> 16:25.275
- Please! Let him out!

16:25.359 --> 16:28.070
- Jessie, you don't
understand what he's like.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.114
He wanted to give you up
to the Realm

16:30.197 --> 16:31.532
when you were a baby.

16:31.615 --> 16:32.074
He wanted to ruin
your childhood!

16:35.661 --> 16:36.995
Jax, what are you waiting for?

16:37.079 --> 16:38.497
Get him out of here!

16:42.668 --> 16:44.628
- Why would you do that?!

16:44.712 --> 16:45.713
- Uh...

16:47.756 --> 16:49.717
- You did well, son.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.009
You did very well.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.097
- Thanks.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.730
- (sniffing)

17:02.813 --> 17:04.481
Eww...

17:04.565 --> 17:06.150
What's that smell?

17:06.233 --> 17:08.902
(sniffing)

17:08.986 --> 17:11.320
Did I get the Kanay Sense?!

17:11.405 --> 17:13.073
- Hey, Diego.

17:13.156 --> 17:14.742
- (sniffing)

17:14.825 --> 17:16.410
Oh, bro!
Wow, you're ripe.

17:16.492 --> 17:17.453
- What?

17:17.536 --> 17:19.788
(sniffing)

17:19.872 --> 17:20.955
Oh-- sorry.

17:21.039 --> 17:23.125
- No, bro, it's fine, I mean--

17:23.208 --> 17:25.752
I know what it's like
to be the stinky one.

17:25.836 --> 17:26.837
Well, to witches.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.465
To humans I always
smell like a peach.

17:29.548 --> 17:30.799
- You sure about that, bro?

17:30.883 --> 17:32.801
- Hey, the pizza oven
gets very hot okay?

17:32.885 --> 17:35.137
Sometimes I sweat!
So sue me.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.765
- Eww... I hope you don't
sweat into the pizzas.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.892
- No, never.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.059
- Well, anyway, I stopped by

17:41.143 --> 17:43.854
'cause I have
something for you.

17:43.937 --> 17:45.272
I know how you're
looking for your people.

17:46.064 --> 17:47.191
This is from the Sanctuary.

17:49.276 --> 17:50.611
- Yeah, but... this is Mia's.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.738
She made it, remember?

17:52.821 --> 17:54.364
- Impossible.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.033
Mia never lived
in the Everglades...

17:56.116 --> 17:56.200
not in this life anyway.

17:58.452 --> 18:01.413
- Wait, so, that means that--

18:04.750 --> 18:06.752
That there's another Kanay
in the Everglades.

18:13.801 --> 18:14.760
- You can come in, Jax.

18:14.843 --> 18:15.761
(door opens)

18:15.844 --> 18:18.472
- (sighs)

18:18.555 --> 18:19.515
Can we talk for a minute?

18:19.598 --> 18:21.099
- I guess.

18:23.811 --> 18:28.065
Listen, Jessie, I know
that you're mad at me,

18:28.148 --> 18:29.733
and I get that.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.861
But... I'd rather
you be safe and mad--

18:32.945 --> 18:34.029
- I know.

18:34.112 --> 18:35.239
- I did what I had to do
to protect you and Mom

18:35.322 --> 18:37.074
and I'd do it again
if I had to.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.201
I just need you
to know that.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.583
Oh, um, and one thing.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.376
You haven't been feeling
your powers

18:47.459 --> 18:49.044
coming up at all, have you?

18:49.127 --> 18:50.212
- No.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.880
- No... small shocks
when you touch things?

18:51.964 --> 18:54.424
No tingling in your fingers?

18:54.508 --> 18:55.759
- Nope... why?

18:55.843 --> 18:56.927
- No reason.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.178
Just... wanted you
to look out, that's all.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.727
- And... drink!

19:06.144 --> 19:07.312
No...

19:12.568 --> 19:13.735
- Thank you.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.988
- This is all
because of that--

19:16.071 --> 19:16.989
MADDIE: Emma!

19:17.072 --> 19:18.156
- Exactly!

19:18.240 --> 19:20.909
- No, I mean-- she's here.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.286
- Hi, Gigi.

19:22.369 --> 19:25.747
Can I get a black and white
milkshake... extra syrup?

19:25.831 --> 19:27.416
It's been a tough day.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.252
- Ooh! Video confessional,
love it!

19:30.335 --> 19:32.963
And... go!

19:33.046 --> 19:35.340
- I'll just take the shake.

19:35.424 --> 19:38.552
- Fine. But extra syrup's
gonna cost you extra.

19:44.474 --> 19:47.352
- You've got a lot of nerve
showing up here!

19:48.520 --> 19:49.605
- Maddie...

19:49.688 --> 19:51.315
- You stole my powers!

19:51.398 --> 19:52.524
Now give them back!

19:52.608 --> 19:56.528
- I didn't steal them...
I borrowed them.

19:56.612 --> 19:59.489
- Borrowing is when someone
willingly gives you something.

19:59.573 --> 20:00.949
- Not when you trick them
into using a spell

20:01.033 --> 20:02.367
from the Evil Hexa-rella!

20:02.451 --> 20:05.954
- I'm gonna let that one slide
just this once.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.499
- I promise I'll give them
back to you... soon.

20:09.583 --> 20:13.295
- It's one thing to do this
to your sworn frenemy,

20:13.378 --> 20:16.632
but to do it to Proxy,
an actual friend?

20:17.549 --> 20:19.551
Low.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.886
- Yeah, Emma,
friends don't say

20:20.969 --> 20:21.595
that they're gonna
help each other out,

20:21.678 --> 20:23.305
and then lie to them.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.473
- I-- I--

20:24.556 --> 20:26.767
- One black-and-white shake,
extra syrup.

20:26.850 --> 20:27.768
DIEGO: Oh... no!

20:27.851 --> 20:29.436
She does not get
our best milk shake!

20:30.354 --> 20:32.814
Ooh, ow, okay,
brain freeze...

20:32.898 --> 20:34.608
- Don't worry, I can fix it!

20:36.151 --> 20:36.985
No, wait, I can't!

20:37.069 --> 20:39.529
- It's okay, I'll do it.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.157
- Wait! No! Don't. Just--

20:42.240 --> 20:43.825
Just, just,
just leave, please.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.539
- I'm sorry!
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

20:49.623 --> 20:50.749
- If you won't leave...

20:52.542 --> 20:53.377
...we will.

20:55.671 --> 20:56.463
- Guys, wait! Please!

21:10.978 --> 21:12.646
- Hope you're having
a better night than I am.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.191
Emma?

21:16.274 --> 21:18.610
- This needs to end... now.

21:18.694 --> 21:21.738
- I'm sorry-- I would have
come through the front door,

21:21.822 --> 21:23.865
it's just that every time I do,
your dad intercepts me--

21:23.949 --> 21:24.741
- Everybody's turning
on me, Jax.

21:24.825 --> 21:27.327
- Not me.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.538
- I can't... I don't want to
lose my friends over this.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.999
- Em, if it's not worth it,

21:32.082 --> 21:33.125
just say the word
and we'll stop.

21:33.208 --> 21:35.961
- To have my mother again?

21:36.044 --> 21:37.629
Of course it's worth it.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.047
But I have to do it fast,

21:39.131 --> 21:40.716
or else it'll be too late
to get the others back.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.260
- Okay, so how do we
get this done quickly?

21:43.343 --> 21:45.053
- With more power.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.680
Maddie wasn't enough.

21:46.763 --> 21:48.974
It has to come from one of the
most powerful witches around.

21:49.057 --> 21:52.477
- You already have Maddie's
powers and the Council's powers.

21:52.561 --> 21:53.729
You won't even take mine.

21:53.812 --> 21:57.441
There are no more powerful
wizards or witches left.

21:57.524 --> 21:58.775
- Yes, there are.

21:59.860 --> 22:00.986
Your dad.
