WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.252
Previously on Rosewood...

00:02.335 --> 00:03.586
I was dishonorably discharged.

00:03.670 --> 00:06.881
Things we did make it nearly
impossible to come back home whole.

00:06.965 --> 00:08.717
Soldiers till we...
I'm gonna walk!

00:08.800 --> 00:11.553
He doesn't eat, doesn't sleep,
and any time I say something

00:11.636 --> 00:13.763
-it just makes it worse.
-It's not your fault.

00:13.847 --> 00:17.183
When are you gonna realize that
whatever happens to Slade isn't yours.

00:17.392 --> 00:18.727
There's been a complication.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.603
- What's wrong?
- Clear.

00:21.312 --> 00:22.689
It's gonna be okay.

00:43.376 --> 00:44.294
Leese...

00:45.378 --> 00:46.796
It's not working for me anymore.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.215
Did you hear me?

00:51.384 --> 00:52.427
I can't stay.

01:20.663 --> 01:21.831
Hey, Rosie.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.708
Thought you had me
back there at that turn.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.627
So, that was you back there at the light?

01:25.710 --> 01:27.629
Hot Miami night, hot cars...

01:27.712 --> 01:30.006
Sometimes you gotta get out
and burn some pavement, you know?

01:30.090 --> 01:31.132
Right, right.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.843
Question is, what were you
doing out this late?

01:35.095 --> 01:39.724
When the craving comes on,
Rosie's got to have his macadamia nut.

01:39.808 --> 01:43.812
Macadamia nut? About 127th on
the list of stuff I don't crave.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.523
Oh, okay, this is coming from a guy
who goes out after dark

01:46.606 --> 01:48.149
to get a hot dog off a rolling cart.
Really?

01:48.233 --> 01:50.777
There's only one place in whole of Miami
you could get those dogs.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.196
-I'm talking of lost treasure.
-Yeah, treasure full of nitrates.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.823
You gotta protect the temple.

01:55.031 --> 01:58.576
You need to get that shoulder you been
nursing the last half hour checked out.

01:58.660 --> 02:01.412
Line at the VA hospital will kill me
sooner than the shoulder does.

02:01.496 --> 02:02.580
So, I'm good.

02:02.664 --> 02:05.333
Speaking of good, what's up
with you and my sister, man?

02:06.501 --> 02:08.419
-What you talking about? Nothing's up.
-Really?

02:08.962 --> 02:11.047
Come on, bro,
I know you're interested in her.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.967
The way you look at her, the way you
guys are together, you got to be, right?

02:14.050 --> 02:16.094
-No, it's not like that.
-No?

02:16.177 --> 02:17.971
Plus, she's with Adrian, so.

02:18.054 --> 02:19.389
Adrian.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.057
Right.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.351
So, maybe you could tell me
what you call it.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.436
Well, you call it "partners."

02:25.895 --> 02:27.730
-Partners?
-That's what I call it.

02:27.814 --> 02:28.898
-Partners.
-Hmm.

02:28.982 --> 02:32.026
Okay, but she's a cop... and you're not.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.154
So, that's not a real thing.

02:34.237 --> 02:38.533
I need black and white from you right now.
Ain't no gray in my world and you're gray.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.577
So tell me what color you see.

02:40.660 --> 02:43.913
Well, I see a grown black man,

02:43.997 --> 02:46.416
trying to enjoy his macadamia fix, okay?

02:46.499 --> 02:48.501
But getting a whole lot of questions
thrown at me.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.295
See, man, that's the thing, man.
It's my fault.

02:50.378 --> 02:53.256
'Cause these ain't really questions.
More like I'm telling you...

02:54.591 --> 02:55.758
You're holding her back.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.554
You're taking up
a lot of space in her head.

03:00.555 --> 03:03.391
Is it her head... or yours?

03:05.393 --> 03:08.521
I like you, Rosie. I do, man.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.566
But if you're not gonna step up
with my sister, you need to step aside.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.360
And there's things
you don't know about my family.

03:14.944 --> 03:17.989
But I'm back now, and I'm here,
and I know what my sister needs.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.547
Is there a problem, officer?

03:34.631 --> 03:36.382
License and registration, please.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.513
-How much have you had to drink tonight?
-Nothing.

03:42.597 --> 03:45.183
I just came from grading papers.
I'm a teacher at--

03:45.266 --> 03:46.726
Ma'am, step out of the car, please.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.089
What's dragging today?
You don't have your usual bounce.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.341
-I don't have a bounce.
-You definitely have a bounce.

04:18.424 --> 04:21.052
-But right now you have a drag.
-I shot my brother last night...

04:21.135 --> 04:23.137
in my dream,
and then he didn't pick up his phone.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.807
-I saw Marcos last night. No bullet holes.
-What?

04:25.890 --> 04:28.184
Two guys, two cars, crossing paths.

04:28.559 --> 04:29.394
Gentleman's cruise.

04:29.477 --> 04:32.021
I don't know what a gentleman's cruise is,
but do you know how happy that makes me?

04:32.105 --> 04:35.191
That he's okay, and
B: That you guys are connecting.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.526
Yeah, we connected.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.403
He doesn't do that with everybody.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.989
Finally, I feel like he thinks
there's a place for him, here.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.700
-Thank you, Rosie.
-Whatever I can do to help.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.076
But you might want to
lock it up with Adrian,

04:45.159 --> 04:48.329
so you're not home, alone in bed,
having assassination dreams.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.541
Thanny Torres, 32, teacher.

04:52.208 --> 04:55.545
There's the fiancé. I'll go make
some small talk, you do your thing.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.298
What prevented you

04:59.299 --> 05:00.758
getting to that door.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.219
Mr. Camp, hope you understand...

05:04.178 --> 05:05.847
I gotta ask you where you were last night.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.766
Home. We have a new puppy.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.686
Thanny called to say she was
staying late at the school, working.

05:11.769 --> 05:14.188
-Do you know a lot about each other?
-We were getting married.

05:14.272 --> 05:17.400
Your fiancée was picked up
on suspicion of DUI last night.

05:17.483 --> 05:20.236
She was later taken to jail
and released at 2 a.m.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.286
Hold on a minute.

05:30.621 --> 05:31.497
Detective.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.500
Don't say anything about the cane.
This is doctor's orders.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.128
-Willy Wonka vibe, don't you think?
-Slade, what are you doing here?

05:37.211 --> 05:38.212
And what's with the car?

05:38.296 --> 05:40.715
I lost a kidney.
I figured I deserve a new car.

05:40.798 --> 05:42.216
Slade, you're supposed to be on strict bed
rest.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.011
Oh, Rosie? Really? I've been in bed
for the last 24 hours.

05:45.094 --> 05:47.889
Plus, we have a crime and a body.
This is exactly where I belong.

05:47.972 --> 05:50.767
We got this, Cap.
You can go back to the candy factory.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.019
No gloves, no love. Come on,
what are you doing?

05:53.102 --> 05:54.520
Sorry, my bad.

05:54.979 --> 05:57.023
All right, Rosie. What do we got?

05:57.106 --> 06:00.234
Well, at the moment, we have a dead body
with a whole lot of questions.

06:00.318 --> 06:03.071
Where, when, why, how, what.
My favorite five.

06:03.738 --> 06:06.199
Damn! It feels good to be back.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.079
Hey!

06:11.162 --> 06:14.957
Sorry I'm late. I'm on West coast time.
It's a Cali thing, you won't understand.

06:15.041 --> 06:19.295
I understand that you're late, and that
TMI is at some FBI reach around party,

06:19.379 --> 06:21.672
and I'm alone doing everything.
I understand that.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.758
Hang loose, that means "I'm sorry."

06:23.841 --> 06:24.675
No, it doesn't.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.677
And don't do that weird thing
with your fingers ever again.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.597
-What you talking about west coast time?
-Oh, Angel City, baby.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.058
Yeah, Rosie's moving forward with
opening that second lab in LA.

06:32.141 --> 06:35.228
So, I wanted to prep in case
I got called up to the majors.

06:35.311 --> 06:39.399
Back it up, brah. Rosie talked to you
about Angel City?

06:39.482 --> 06:40.775
Not exactly.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.610
Rosie, what's up with
this Angel City thing?

06:42.693 --> 06:44.654
Early stages. We'll talk later, I promise.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.114
What do you got for me?

06:46.197 --> 06:50.952
Well, I discovered that our sweet school
teacher has a not so sweet liver.

06:51.035 --> 06:53.329
Yep. Definite signs of early cirrhosis.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.748
Oh.
And Mitchie came in with a weird accent.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.209
I don't have an accent.
Okay, yeah, the voice is weird.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.211
Could this liver damage
have anything to do

07:00.294 --> 07:01.838
with her trip to jail
for the DUI last night?

07:01.921 --> 07:03.297
This damage was from years ago.

07:03.381 --> 07:06.300
There are signs that the liver
has been regenerating healthy tissue.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.052
Looks like abuse was in her past.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.972
Let me fill you in on
the rest of her past.

07:11.055 --> 07:13.975
Thanny here, has a record.
One as long as my arm.

07:14.058 --> 07:17.353
She was arrested a dozen times
over ten years ago for prostitution.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.188
-She was a prostitute?
-A young one.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.107
Take a look at this.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.403
-What am I looking at?
-It's the letter "A."

07:25.611 --> 07:26.654
A tattoo?

07:26.737 --> 07:28.656
No, scar tissue from branding.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.450
So, what does "A" mean?

07:30.533 --> 07:32.702
That's the first question
that we need to answer.

07:36.497 --> 07:37.790
Hey, guys, thanks for coming.

07:37.874 --> 07:41.794
I'm sitting on something here.
I don't know, maybe I'm seeing blurry.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.005
-So, I want other eyes.
-Okay, Hornstock, what is it?

07:44.088 --> 07:47.467
Just gimme a second. What I'm about
to show you, let's just say is...

07:47.800 --> 07:49.385
problematic for a good friend.

07:51.095 --> 07:55.224
An impound officer I know saw this,
and thought I should have it.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.517
That's Thanny.

08:01.439 --> 08:02.773
And that's Slade.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.694
And just a few hours later, she's dead.

08:06.777 --> 08:09.030
I don't know how this
doctor thing works but--

08:09.113 --> 08:10.823
We're going to find
his prints on her body.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.867
He was on our crime scene
putting his hands all over her.

08:12.950 --> 08:15.328
Do you think he did it on purpose
to cover something up?

08:15.411 --> 08:16.913
I don't know.
Slade must be in some trouble.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.372
He's in some kind of something.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.375
And the three of us have to find out
what it is before someone else does.

08:35.139 --> 08:38.184
All I'm saying is, people could catch me
doing weird things on camera, too.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.436
-You telling me you got no quirks?
-Of course, I do.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.564
Pretzel obsessions,
shower dancing to Shakira,

08:43.648 --> 08:45.942
still telling myself pro wrestling's real.

08:46.025 --> 08:49.695
Not picking up a prostitute from jail
and lying to my own team.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.240
Former prostitute,
maybe there's an explanation.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.867
You know, he did admit to like it
when ladies have gone through red tape.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.912
But none of them showed up dead
with Slade's name all over it.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.499
You need to work on your library voice.

09:01.582 --> 09:04.544
-Does this look like a library to you?
-No, it looks like a precinct. His.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.045
-Ugh...
-You need to play this one carefully.

09:06.128 --> 09:07.088
That's all I'm saying.

09:07.171 --> 09:09.215
-Play what carefully?
-Breakfast.

09:09.674 --> 09:13.010
Between coffee cakes
and one of these moist muffins.

09:13.469 --> 09:17.056
Yeah, I'd go coffee cakes, so we never
have to hear you say "moist" again.

09:17.139 --> 09:18.558
-Am I right?
-Yeah.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.268
-Not a good word.
-Thanks, Cap.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.228
Guess who's back.

09:22.311 --> 09:25.690
We gotta give him the benefit of the doubt
before we start jumping to conclusions.

09:25.773 --> 09:28.609
I'm not jumping. I'm walking.
Straight into his office.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.654
One wrong question, and you blow
everything we've earned with him.

09:31.737 --> 09:35.741
Or what? We march ourselves to IA instead
and potentially ruin his name

09:35.908 --> 09:37.743
before we even know what's going on?

09:39.203 --> 09:43.499
I got to be honest. I'm having a hard time
buying the bed rest thing.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.418
It's just bed rest. It's no thing.

09:45.501 --> 09:49.630
It seems like a thing. You were
a ball of energy at the crime scene.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.091
-Doctors are right. Sleep does wonders.
-Come on.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.261
You can trust me.
I'm not going to tell your doctors.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.973
Or anyone. Where were you two nights ago?

10:05.396 --> 10:07.189
You trying to make me feel guilty about

10:07.273 --> 10:09.609
being home alone
and having an old school TV dinner?

10:10.192 --> 10:12.486
Because I got to admit, it wasn't
very good. I overcooked the brownie.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.572
But I got to catch up on my shows,

10:14.655 --> 10:18.326
and if this is an interrogation, let the
record state that I was watching Narcos.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.077
But, between us,

10:21.954 --> 10:25.374
season four of The Bachelor.
Tell anyone, I kill you.

10:27.418 --> 10:32.548
Well, since you're so well-rested, maybe
you can help me see this more clearly.

10:32.632 --> 10:36.802
A young school teacher about to get
married, she has a history of sex work.

10:36.886 --> 10:40.264
-Something doesn't add up.
-Right, not your routine case.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.808
So, why you surprised
that I'm back to help you handle it?

10:42.892 --> 10:45.186
Is there something else
that you want to ask me?

10:53.277 --> 10:58.366
I should just ask Rosie. I'm sure he
already found something on the body.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.327
Always does.
Now go catch your killer, Detective.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.288
Always do.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.750
Wait, Slade is somehow involved
with this woman's death?

11:07.833 --> 11:09.835
We never draw conclusions
unless we come to one.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.462
This case is no different. Understood?

11:13.255 --> 11:17.093
Right now, all we know is that
her heart stopped and it was healthy,

11:17.176 --> 11:18.719
even considering her drug history.

11:18.803 --> 11:21.514
You call it history but tox shows
oxycotton in her system.

11:21.597 --> 11:24.642
There was no sign of injection
or ingestion in her GI tract.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.602
-Mitchie, recheck the X-rays.
-Yeah.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.939
By the way, did you guys check out the
surf report coming in from Malibu today?

11:30.022 --> 11:32.233
West coast, best coast, what up!

11:32.400 --> 11:33.734
What's going on with the fingers?

11:33.901 --> 11:35.486
He's been doing that all morning.

11:35.569 --> 11:38.447
Look, I'm always down to
support the dream, but I got to ask.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.199
Am I being drafted? Because if so--

11:40.282 --> 11:44.370
Pip, I have not even come close to
figuring out my Angel City team, yet.

11:44.829 --> 11:48.124
Check it out. See these bright spots
on the X-ray here?

11:48.207 --> 11:49.959
-That's metal.
-Weird.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.503
-In her lungs?
-Lethal doses of an opioid.

11:52.795 --> 11:56.632
That's how she died. And you know
what has metal particles in it? Oxycodone.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.884
But one problem with that.
Users don't smoke it.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.762
Right. Unlikely she was relapsing.

12:01.846 --> 12:04.348
More likely,
someone forced it into her system.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.435
Question is, how?

12:09.228 --> 12:12.648
Slade wasn't the easiest guy to
get to know. He had a tough upbringing.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.776
-Didn't want to get close to people.
-That's why we're here talking to you.

12:15.860 --> 12:16.902
When he was under your command,

12:16.986 --> 12:19.864
did Slade ever brush up
against any disciplinary action?

12:19.947 --> 12:21.657
Never. His record was crystal clean.

12:21.741 --> 12:25.619
And what about off the clock?
Did he have a thing for street walkers?

12:27.079 --> 12:29.373
Mug like that, I don't think
he was really paying for sex.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.086
Look, the best I can give you is this.

12:34.628 --> 12:38.174
Slade had deep morals that always lost
the battle to his deeper ambitions.

12:38.507 --> 12:40.843
-How so?
-Well, you do the math.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.929
Took me 22 years to get
the captain's chair, he did it in 7.

12:44.013 --> 12:47.475
Rise like that, you're either the best cop
in the world, or the worst.

12:49.643 --> 12:52.104
Due respect, we're talking about
the Slade from the past.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.814
When was the last time you even saw him?

12:54.023 --> 12:56.442
I didn't actually see him, but he was
in the building two days ago.

12:56.525 --> 12:59.069
Paid a visit to the ME.
Wanted to get eyes on a Jane Doe.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.489
Why would he have interest
in a Jane Doe in your district?

13:01.572 --> 13:05.493
I have no idea. Just a homeless girl.
Overdose, happens all the time.

13:05.576 --> 13:08.204
But Slade's the kind of guy that
needed his nose in everything.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.874
Nineteen, heroin, no foul play.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.126
Did chest X-ray reveal
any metal particles?

13:14.210 --> 13:15.336
No, it was clear.

13:15.419 --> 13:17.213
And Ryan Slade came to see her?

13:17.296 --> 13:18.923
Yep. He just wanted cause of death.

13:19.298 --> 13:23.260
But, he was her second visit.
Which is a new record for a Jane Doe.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.555
Yeah, the other was a tall, Cuban girl.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.724
Signed in as "Kitty."
I think she was a working girl.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.684
-What did Kitty want?
-No idea.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.770
Didn't even know her name.
She's undocumented.

13:32.853 --> 13:35.981
-So, tomorrow she's going to the town.
-I'm gonna need you to hold off on that.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.734
I need her body sent to my lab
as part of our murder investigation.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.611
-What?
-Because I'm looking at an "A."

13:46.450 --> 13:47.952
You ready for a good time, Rosie?

13:48.035 --> 13:50.830
I got my good time game face on,
and these shades will help sell it.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.290
I'm not sure what you're selling,
but I think that's her.

13:53.374 --> 13:56.585
Ooh! A couple. Fun.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.338
We're actually not a couple,
and we're not here for what you think.

13:59.421 --> 14:01.757
You're Kitty from the back page
of the Sun Express, right?

14:01.841 --> 14:05.511
I just took those pics. Don't even
play like I look different in person.

14:05.594 --> 14:07.054
Besides, I don't do much talking.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.597
That includes telling anyone about this

14:08.681 --> 14:10.891
secret little thing you have
with this fine piece of fudge.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.142
Again, we're not a couple.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.270
We're here about a murder investigation.

14:14.728 --> 14:19.525
Look, we all have our fetishes, but
role playing isn't my strongest suit.

14:19.608 --> 14:21.402
The cuffs aren't just for show.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.404
So, you're gonna spill?

14:25.906 --> 14:27.324
Have you ever seen this man?

14:28.576 --> 14:30.494
I thought these were
gonna be hard questions.

14:30.578 --> 14:34.039
Yeah, many times.
But, like, ten years ago.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.875
He basically paid off my mortgage.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.877
What? Like a loan shark?

14:37.960 --> 14:40.546
Like my longest and best paying customer.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.882
He was a lot rougher than a shark.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.176
He was a very dangerous man.

14:53.434 --> 14:56.312
Are you absolutely certain the man
in this photo was your customer?

14:56.395 --> 15:01.066
I may forget faces and names,
and marriages, when I'm asked to.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.860
I'd never forget those eyes.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.654
What was behind them terrified me.

15:06.196 --> 15:07.990
-He terrified you?
-All of us.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.533
He was erratic.

15:10.409 --> 15:13.162
Damaged... especially to Thanny.

15:21.545 --> 15:22.963
-Get in.
-I'm booked.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.007
I say when you're booked. Hey!

15:26.091 --> 15:27.676
Don't walk away from me.
Hey, chief, move away.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.012
I said move, or I'll crack your skull on
this pavement. Move!

15:31.096 --> 15:32.264
Hey, where you going?

15:32.348 --> 15:34.350
-Amparo is watching.
-I don't care who's watching.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.435
I want everyone to watch so they know when
I need you, I need you.

15:36.518 --> 15:37.519
You understand that?

15:37.603 --> 15:40.940
And we all did as he said after that day.
Men don't pay for damaged goods.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.275
Listen, the man in the photo is a friend.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.486
So, if you or someone else
is trying to frame him,

15:45.569 --> 15:47.279
set him up to take the fall for something,

15:47.363 --> 15:50.783
you're going to feel the hurt
in places even your customers don't touch.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.620
You asked the questions. If you don't like
the answers, that's your problem.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.331
Show me your foot.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.711
I charge a pretty penny
for that sort of thing.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.296
You wanna show us in the precinct?

16:06.006 --> 16:08.884
Let me guess. "A" for Amparo, your pimp.

16:09.301 --> 16:12.012
He branded his girls so the other pimps
knew you were his.

16:12.096 --> 16:15.307
Those are scars from shackles. Wanna
tell us how you were trafficked here?

16:17.518 --> 16:20.145
Girls from Cuba heard about Amparo.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.605
It was a smuggling service.

16:21.689 --> 16:24.900
They brought you to the US, get you a
citizenship and they send for your family.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.235
American dream sold cheap.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.029
Do you know how many girls
believed they had a chance

16:29.113 --> 16:30.280
to walk the streets paved with gold,

16:30.364 --> 16:34.076
only to find their feet branded
and shackled, face up in a brothel.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.412
-Can you give us an ID on the brothel?
-Yeah, sure.

16:36.912 --> 16:40.082
But you'll find a bodega.
The location always changes.

16:40.165 --> 16:43.043
That's why the ring lasted so long.
And that's why it's back.

16:43.502 --> 16:46.213
And I'm sorry,
but Amparo stole my life once,

16:46.296 --> 16:48.173
so I'd like to stay
as far away as possible.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.759
If that's true,
then why did you visit that Jane Doe?

16:51.301 --> 16:53.721
Because I saw her branding in a newspaper.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.056
And I knew if I didn't go say goodbye,
nobody would.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.851
Her family doesn't know where she is,
and I don't know who she is.

16:59.476 --> 17:00.894
But she's my sister.

17:01.979 --> 17:05.024
That's what happens when
women share in the same struggle.

17:05.107 --> 17:09.445
We form a sisterhood so much stronger
than the men who oppress us.

17:13.782 --> 17:16.368
Matt Baldovsky, Amparo's real name.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.370
Yeah, a real sicko,
no matter what he calls himself.

17:18.454 --> 17:19.955
We got a bigger problem than that.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.498
Baldovsky's in Florida state prison.

17:21.582 --> 17:24.084
Has been for the past decade
on sex trafficking charges.

17:24.168 --> 17:26.754
All right, he's not our guy.
But what did his case file say?

17:26.837 --> 17:29.131
I mean, you don't run
a sex trafficking ring alone.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.424
They're sealed.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.345
This was on Thanny's person.
Check this out.

17:38.348 --> 17:41.185
Look, that's our Jane Doe.
See the "A" branding on her foot?

17:41.268 --> 17:43.854
Yeah, I do. I'm guessing so did Thanny,
and so did Kitty.

17:43.937 --> 17:45.564
And so did Slade.

17:45.647 --> 17:48.358
Do you think he had a reason
to silence these girls?

17:53.322 --> 17:56.492
Are you guys sneaking cupcakes or
devising a plan to take over the world?

17:56.784 --> 17:58.702
Just nutshelling through this case.

17:58.786 --> 18:01.288
-Batting it around.
-In the basement?

18:01.830 --> 18:02.873
Hmm.

18:06.543 --> 18:07.961
Looks interesting.

18:08.378 --> 18:10.422
Yeah, I mean,
we haven't gotten that far, yet.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.257
Like he said, just nutshelling.

18:12.341 --> 18:16.095
That's why I came down here.
Usually I'm privy to the nutshell. Right?

18:17.846 --> 18:19.056
So...

18:19.139 --> 18:20.390
Take me through what you got.

18:20.474 --> 18:25.437
Well, uh... Thanny's fiance was blindsided
by her history as a sex worker.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.564
Yeah, as of now, he's clear.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.316
Alibi checked out with a noisy neighbor,

18:29.399 --> 18:32.486
who strayed into their TV room. She could
account for his minute to minutes.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.867
-Otherwise, you, uh, you dry?
-Yeah.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.454
For now.

18:42.538 --> 18:46.792
Since you guys are at an impasse,
Ira, I'll borrow you.

18:55.008 --> 18:56.301
Hear that?

18:58.137 --> 18:59.930
-I don't hear nothing.
-Exactly.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.558
These walls are thick.

19:02.975 --> 19:06.436
Soundproofed.
It's the quietest place in the precinct.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.480
Safe.

19:12.025 --> 19:13.652
Well, I come at it differently.

19:14.069 --> 19:17.156
This table, these chairs, opposite sides.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.324
Adversarial dynamics.

19:20.242 --> 19:24.079
Not if there's alcohol involved.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.917
I see what you're thinking.
Can a man get a cube?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.419
We're gonna have this straight up.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.838
You've been walking around like you have a
permanent question mark on your forehead,

19:32.921 --> 19:37.092
that you wanna say something,
so I thought a little liquid courage

19:37.176 --> 19:38.844
might help you ask it, you know?

19:39.386 --> 19:41.471
Maybe there's something you wanna ask me.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.599
Or tell me.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.394
I guess that depends how close we are.

19:49.438 --> 19:52.149
-Are we close, Ira?
-Yeah.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.985
-We're close.
-Good.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.905
Because I think we're better
working on the same page.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.075
I want your help.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.621
I may need it. But I got to ask you...

20:06.121 --> 20:08.790
How important is this job to you?

20:12.377 --> 20:13.879
What are you asking me, Slade?

20:14.588 --> 20:18.050
If suddenly this were to all go away,

20:18.133 --> 20:20.302
if it didn't exist,
where do you see yourself?

20:21.345 --> 20:24.723
Because if that ever happened,
I'd want to help you get there.

20:24.806 --> 20:26.850
You just need to tell me
what it is you need.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.518
-I don't.
-Ah!

20:29.311 --> 20:31.521
Everyone needs something. Come on.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.483
Five years from now... What do you want,

20:34.566 --> 20:36.860
an island somewhere,
you sipping something from a straw?

20:37.736 --> 20:39.321
Ira, I got reach...

20:40.072 --> 20:41.573
way beyond my chair...

20:41.657 --> 20:44.159
I got a lot of money, and I got means.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.954
I don't want your money.
I don't want your means.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.832
I'm all set with this job.
I just want to do it.

20:51.291 --> 20:53.669
So just tell me what it is
that you need to tell me.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.182
Then, are we done here?

21:26.368 --> 21:29.288
It's an RFID chip. The kind they use
in animals to track them.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.790
I found it in Jane Doe's neck,
while taking tissue samples.

21:32.124 --> 21:35.419
A human ID tag. So, someone knows
every move these girls were making.

21:37.796 --> 21:39.381
Amparo.

21:39.464 --> 21:42.175
But not the same Amparo
that's rotting away in a prison cell.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.845
No, but whoever's running this
is using the same name now.

21:44.928 --> 21:47.222
And those are the GPS coordinates
of her last location.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.348
Yeah, look at this.

21:56.189 --> 21:58.150
Are you sure you got the location
on the chip right?

21:58.233 --> 22:00.777
I'm definitely sure this is it.
The Jane Doe that died last week,

22:00.861 --> 22:02.904
this location was on her chip seven times.

22:03.280 --> 22:07.326
But no, it does not look like a location
of a thriving human trafficking ring.

22:07.701 --> 22:11.538
You see the man behind me? At one o'clock,
reading the newspaper, in long sleeves.

22:11.621 --> 22:12.789
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

22:12.873 --> 22:17.377
Either he's being modest about that
body of his, or he's not on vacation.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.963
You see him eying the guy
watering the plant over there?

22:20.047 --> 22:22.716
-What's so weird about that?
-Yeah, there's no water in the bottle.

22:24.509 --> 22:25.385
Okay.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.012
All right, time for me to go into action.

22:27.095 --> 22:28.221
Do I look like a tourist?

22:28.305 --> 22:31.016
No, so you're gonna have to sell it.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.936
Hey, chief.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.897
You know what?
You look like an eligible guy.

22:36.980 --> 22:40.859
I'm in town on business from Des Moines.
You ever been there? An IT convention.

22:40.942 --> 22:44.613
And I was hoping you could give me
the intro to some ladies.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.198
Check with the concierge.

22:46.281 --> 22:48.492
I'm sure they can direct you
to an escort agency.

22:48.575 --> 22:51.119
Escort? No. That's not really my flavor.

22:51.661 --> 22:53.413
I don't know.
Maybe I'm talking to the wrong guy.

22:53.497 --> 22:57.042
My friend, Amparo, sent me here and said
you can get me what I need.

23:03.924 --> 23:05.175
Wait here.

23:05.967 --> 23:09.304
You are the right guy. I thought that was.
I thought you were.

23:14.267 --> 23:15.185
Get up.

23:20.732 --> 23:23.860
You're getting on the elevator.
When it stops, get off.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.282
I'm Yaselyn.

24:15.036 --> 24:16.329
No, no, no, don't, don't.

24:16.413 --> 24:19.458
Don't do that. I'm Dr. Beaumont Rosewood.
I'm here to help you.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.295
Come sit on the bed.
I'm just here to help.

24:24.379 --> 24:26.423
Now, I'm gonna need you
to help me, too. Okay?

24:26.798 --> 24:28.717
So, tell me,
who's in charge of this operation?

24:29.134 --> 24:31.011
Where is he? Is he close to here?

24:38.602 --> 24:40.395
All right, this is going to
sting a little bit.

24:52.782 --> 24:53.783
Shh.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.251
-Brilliant.
-No, you need to call the cops.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.003
The cops need to hit this place hard.

25:05.086 --> 25:06.880
No, if calvary comes now,
we'll never catch the killer.

25:06.963 --> 25:08.256
Remember, the operation keeps moving.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.259
Amparo is here. He runs this
whole operation out of this hotel.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.344
Time's up.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.766
Let's go.

25:18.433 --> 25:19.768
We need to go now.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.686
No, I'm not leaving without her.
She's sick.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.815
-We're busy.
-Open up.

25:25.899 --> 25:27.317
I need to talk to her.

25:33.990 --> 25:34.950
Wrap it up.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.743
Need you in another room.

25:46.086 --> 25:47.128
We better get out of here.

25:51.466 --> 25:52.467
Come on.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.282
Yaselyn.

26:15.365 --> 26:18.368
Look, I know you've been through a lot,
but I need you to concentrate...

26:18.451 --> 26:20.662
and tell me if you recognize
any of these people.

26:23.456 --> 26:26.793
No one? Okay. We can get back to this
once you've had some rest.

26:28.378 --> 26:31.506
- It's okay. He's my brother.
- Sorry, was on my way to the range.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.341
-You good?
-Yeah, we good.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.260
You good?

26:37.304 --> 26:38.430
Yeah, I'm good.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.516
I'll see you later.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.979
The doctor in me tells me
we need to get her to a hospital.

26:46.062 --> 26:49.232
Yeah, well, the detective in me says
that'll risk saving every girl involved.

26:49.316 --> 26:52.611
No. Save my sisters.
I'm not going anywhere until you do.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.364
-I know him.
-Which one?

26:56.448 --> 26:58.408
Which picture, sweetie?
You have to point to him.

26:58.491 --> 27:01.661
Him. That man. I've seen him before.

27:04.414 --> 27:05.332
This man?

27:06.333 --> 27:07.709
Where? Where have you seen him?

27:07.792 --> 27:09.169
Back at the hotel.

27:12.297 --> 27:14.466
Found this in her neck.
It's a tracking device. It's active.

27:14.549 --> 27:15.383
What?

27:17.218 --> 27:18.803
All right, wrap that up. We're--

27:19.846 --> 27:21.014
Get down.

27:25.185 --> 27:26.519
- Everyone okay?
- You okay?

27:26.936 --> 27:29.481
-Yeah, we're good.
-Good. 'Cause we're on the move again.

27:34.778 --> 27:37.614
We weren't followed, so I think
we're safer now. Is she okay?

27:37.697 --> 27:39.366
Yeah, she's scared, but she's all right.

27:43.244 --> 27:47.874
Look, Rosie,
what happened with us in the bed,

27:48.249 --> 27:49.626
at the hotel...

27:50.335 --> 27:54.130
I'd say sorry to interrupt, but I've
missed walking in on these moments.

27:54.214 --> 27:57.217
No, no, this is not a moment. This is...

27:57.300 --> 27:59.886
We're actually waiting
on the results of the chip.

27:59.969 --> 28:01.721
So, call me if you hear anything.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.348
I have to see someone.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.563
First time here.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.857
I got to say,
this ventilation needs some love.

28:12.941 --> 28:17.278
Nah. Weak ventilation
keeps the weak spirited out... usually.

28:17.362 --> 28:20.031
Lots of alone time. That explains why
you're a perfect shot.

28:20.657 --> 28:22.200
Got any advice for a civilian?

28:23.368 --> 28:24.369
Yeah.

28:24.786 --> 28:26.913
Join the army. If not...

28:27.288 --> 28:30.208
think of somebody who motivates you
to hit them dead center every time.

28:38.299 --> 28:41.594
Close, but close gets you killed
where I'm from.

28:41.886 --> 28:45.014
I guess I don't harbor the vengeance
that's needed for your advice.

28:45.432 --> 28:48.977
Now why would you?
You're surrounded by family and friends.

28:49.310 --> 28:51.020
Fancy billboards.

28:51.104 --> 28:53.440
Me, I got two things.

28:53.773 --> 28:55.233
My mother and my sister.

28:55.316 --> 28:58.778
My motivation,
anybody who stands in the way of that.

29:00.447 --> 29:02.282
Yeah, it got me thinking
about my sister, too.

29:02.782 --> 29:05.535
Back in the 11th grade,
I witnessed her defending herself against

29:05.618 --> 29:09.330
a bully who got too little love at home
and had too much to prove in the hallways.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.499
And it was that day I realized that

29:11.583 --> 29:14.461
Pippy was a strong woman
who knew how to hold her own.

29:14.919 --> 29:17.797
Yet, she could also use her own judgment
how to protect herself.

29:18.381 --> 29:21.634
And if she ever needed me, she knew
I'd be right there in a heartbeat.

29:22.302 --> 29:23.344
Because that's what brothers do.

29:23.428 --> 29:24.888
Why you telling me your business, Rosie?

29:25.263 --> 29:27.891
Because Pippy reminds me
a lot of Annalise.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.393
It's got to be helpful for you to know.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.313
Oh, it was... Very.

29:38.568 --> 29:41.112
I came back to talk about
very sensitive material,

29:41.196 --> 29:43.072
but I need your word
it stays in this room.

29:43.156 --> 29:46.075
Look, blue to blue, you should know
you can say what you got to say.

29:47.118 --> 29:50.371
There's a human trafficking ring
going on in your jurisdiction.

29:50.455 --> 29:54.000
What're you talking about? Why wouldn't
your entire precinct be on it, then?

29:54.083 --> 29:57.629
Well, we believe Slade might be connected.

29:58.379 --> 30:00.673
And we're running
our own investigation first.

30:01.257 --> 30:03.343
That's why you guys came
asking all those questions.

30:03.426 --> 30:05.887
See, then, we thought
he was an addicted John.

30:05.970 --> 30:09.390
Now, all arrows are pointing
in a direction we wish they weren't.

30:09.474 --> 30:12.852
Maybe he wanted to silence these girls.
We don't know, yet.

30:13.144 --> 30:16.231
But what I need to know is,
are you willing to work with us?

30:17.565 --> 30:19.317
Detective, I have a daughter.

30:19.484 --> 30:23.613
So, I'm willing to do anything you need...
including taking down one of our own.

30:29.869 --> 30:32.789
I can't believe Slade
might be involved in this. Why, Slade?

30:32.872 --> 30:34.707
Why couldn't you just be
the cool, hunky dude

30:34.791 --> 30:37.377
who sometimes acknowledges
I'm in the room, you know?

30:37.460 --> 30:39.003
Oh. Sorry.

30:39.087 --> 30:41.047
-You got the lights.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

30:41.130 --> 30:42.632
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Stay calm. Stay calm.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.634
You can handle this.
Just stay calm.

30:44.717 --> 30:46.511
Yeah, I'm super calm.

30:50.056 --> 30:51.599
Just relax, stay calm.
You got this.

30:52.016 --> 30:54.602
-Yeah, do I look okay?
-You're good. You're perfect.

30:56.646 --> 30:58.982
-License and registration.
-No, I'm good.

31:00.191 --> 31:01.526
How much have you had to drink?

31:02.402 --> 31:03.236
He thinks I'm drunk.

31:03.319 --> 31:05.321
-Step out of the vehicle.
-Oh.

31:05.738 --> 31:06.739
Okay.

31:09.492 --> 31:12.745
Well, you definitely have something
very, very wrong with you,

31:12.829 --> 31:15.456
but I'm afraid it's not something
this precinct can fix.

31:15.540 --> 31:18.042
-You're not drunk.
-Told you I wasn't drunk.

31:18.793 --> 31:20.461
So, am I free to go then?

31:20.962 --> 31:23.882
After I finish writing your citation
for reckless driving.

31:24.549 --> 31:25.842
You stay put.

32:02.670 --> 32:03.588
What's red mean?

32:03.671 --> 32:05.340
There's oxy inside that intoxilyzer.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.216
Oh, my God. Does this mean I'm high?

32:07.300 --> 32:10.595
There were only trace amounts
in the intoxilyzer. You are not high.

32:10.678 --> 32:13.264
Someone put oxy on her mouth piece
and that's how she inhaled it.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.808
Slade was at the jail that night,
has reach in his old precinct,

32:15.892 --> 32:19.020
could have easily have had access to the
intoxilyzer, and tainted the mouth piece.

32:19.103 --> 32:21.773
Yaselyn put him at the hotel.
He's got means and MO.

32:21.856 --> 32:24.359
And if we can get on to his boat
and find the drug...

32:24.442 --> 32:25.777
There's no denying it's him.

32:26.444 --> 32:29.113
But there's no way we can
get on his boat without him knowing.

32:29.197 --> 32:31.032
Oh, there's always a way.

32:33.076 --> 32:35.244
No way I'm doing the whole
wings and ranch thing,

32:35.328 --> 32:38.039
but a little Bball and
a "thank you for the kidney" game.

32:38.498 --> 32:39.791
-I owe you one.
-Oh, please.

32:39.874 --> 32:41.793
We've already been through this.
You don't owe me anything.

32:41.876 --> 32:43.461
Look at those wings. Nice!

32:44.504 --> 32:46.631
Mmm. Good. Really good.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.175
You know, if...

32:50.301 --> 32:51.844
if you want to do me a favor,

32:51.928 --> 32:54.347
that second body in your lab,
the Jane Doe,

32:54.430 --> 32:56.766
maybe you could slow
the roll down on that a little bit.

32:58.142 --> 32:59.477
Now why would I do that?

33:00.520 --> 33:03.147
I'm just asking you to slow it down,
that's all. No big deal.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.612
If you're going through something,
I'm here for you.

33:09.696 --> 33:10.697
But, I can't do that.

33:11.114 --> 33:13.866
I'm your friend, you saved my life, but...

33:13.950 --> 33:16.327
you also saved the life of a doctor
who took an oath.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.457
That's not what I was hoping you'd say.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.335
Mmm, these beans...

33:26.087 --> 33:27.213
in my nose...

33:27.797 --> 33:29.090
they smell like my mother.

33:29.882 --> 33:31.300
Smells will do that.

33:35.304 --> 33:37.140
When was the last time you saw her?

33:38.516 --> 33:40.435
Uh... Two years ago.

33:41.602 --> 33:44.897
My mom put me on a boat
with the promise of freedom.

33:45.106 --> 33:46.190
Of so many things.

33:46.899 --> 33:48.526
But they didn't happen.

33:50.945 --> 33:52.572
Dozens of us in crates.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.700
The sound of ships but no light.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.161
We were branded in the dark.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.122
And my mami, papa,

34:02.623 --> 34:04.083
they must think I'm dead.

34:31.611 --> 34:33.571
If you changed your mind
about the whiskey, Ira,

34:34.781 --> 34:36.157
you could have just asked.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.792
You know, I don't have many things.

34:47.126 --> 34:48.878
But I got this hunk of metal.

34:49.253 --> 34:53.216
Other than my kids, it's the only thing
I'm proud of. I'm willing to die for it.

34:53.299 --> 34:56.177
So, I'm only going to ask you once...
Why'd you pick up Thanny from jail?

34:56.511 --> 35:00.473
Why were you at the Delione hotel?
And think about this one very carefully.

35:01.808 --> 35:04.310
Why did you try to bribe me
in my own interrogation room?

35:09.023 --> 35:10.483
Oh, Ira...

35:10.566 --> 35:12.068
Yeah, you're a simple man.

35:12.735 --> 35:14.237
And I don't mean that in a good way.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.657
I've known it since the moment
you walked into my office.

35:17.740 --> 35:20.159
You will always work harder
than the guy next to you.

35:20.243 --> 35:21.536
Because you have to.

35:22.787 --> 35:25.206
So, let me explain this to you
in a way you can understand.

35:25.289 --> 35:26.791
You're in quicksand right now.

35:27.291 --> 35:30.169
And every second that you stand still,
you're sinking deeper and deeper

35:30.253 --> 35:33.214
until all I'll be looking at, is that
soft spot of your thick, bald head.

35:35.174 --> 35:37.260
You wanna survive? Go ahead, make a move.

35:37.343 --> 35:38.886
Or get the hell off my boat.

35:46.519 --> 35:48.896
You know, I'm the only one
that believed in you...

35:48.980 --> 35:51.399
on this whole thing from Jump Street.
Just me.

35:52.775 --> 35:56.112
You know what? You want me off this boat?
Make me.

35:58.030 --> 35:59.115
Ira.

36:00.074 --> 36:02.243
I think you should go home
and play with your kids.

36:02.326 --> 36:04.537
See if they care about you.
Because I don't.

36:34.775 --> 36:36.736
You didn't answer your phone.
You didn't call.

36:38.154 --> 36:39.197
What happened?

36:40.781 --> 36:41.949
It's time.

37:09.268 --> 37:12.647
I gotta say, Cap,
this is a bizarre place for a reunion.

37:12.730 --> 37:15.149
Well, I wanted to keep it
away from the precinct.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.735
- Talk man to man.
- Sure, is everything okay?

37:17.818 --> 37:21.030
I know, Slade... what you've done.

37:21.113 --> 37:24.283
What you're doing, the girls,
the trafficking, Amparo and all of it.

37:24.367 --> 37:26.410
I'm sorry, I'm not following.

37:26.494 --> 37:27.495
You're burned, Slade.

37:27.578 --> 37:30.706
Your contact in Cuba told me all about the
girls he was helping you traffic up here.

37:30.790 --> 37:33.000
What are you talking about?
I don't know anyone in Cuba.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.502
Estevez Crespo.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.087
Ring a bell?

37:36.170 --> 37:39.382
Before I turn you in, I wanna try to
help you. Give you a chance to be honest.

37:39.465 --> 37:40.716
For your soul.

37:43.302 --> 37:45.471
It's a little late to help me now.

37:45.554 --> 37:47.640
-Don't you think?
-Well, that depends on your story.

37:47.723 --> 37:49.183
My story?

37:51.519 --> 37:55.022
I had no ties to anybody or anything.
I was practically an orphan.

37:56.357 --> 37:58.693
See, you knew that
I would thrive in that world.

37:58.776 --> 38:01.946
Pose as a John, get inside the operation,
so you put me undercover.

38:02.321 --> 38:03.322
Then you left me there.

38:03.406 --> 38:06.242
You left me there for so long,
I forgot what the outside felt like.

38:06.325 --> 38:08.494
And that power, that thrill,
took over my life.

38:09.370 --> 38:10.788
Well, now the thrill is over.

38:10.871 --> 38:13.499
We gave you every chance to come clean,
you lying son of a bitch.

38:13.582 --> 38:15.042
-What are you doing?
-Shut up.

38:15.418 --> 38:18.379
We're here because we know the girls
are being kept in the ship yard somewhere.

38:18.462 --> 38:21.841
Thanks to Captain Marino, we have the
evidence to take you and your ring down.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.976
You knew what you were doing,
didn't you, Marino?

38:32.059 --> 38:34.228
You put me on that case
'cause you knew I'd fail.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.564
People like me, damaged, broken,
we get addicted.

38:39.358 --> 38:40.401
But I didn't.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.820
Next time, I need you to slap me hard.

38:42.903 --> 38:44.071
No, Thanny, I can't do that.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.865
-This is my ticket to freedom.
-I know.

38:45.948 --> 38:47.867
I'm gonna get you out from Amparo,
I promise you.

38:47.950 --> 38:51.203
Then make it look real. If I'm going to
be your CI and risk my life,

38:51.412 --> 38:52.705
then make it worth it.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.709
I rose in that world.
I did things I wasn't proud of,

38:56.792 --> 38:58.711
things I never thought I was capable of.

38:59.253 --> 39:03.007
But I found Amparo, and I gave you
everything you needed, didn't I?

39:03.424 --> 39:05.676
And you put him away for life
and then you promoted me.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.386
You must have seen money to be made.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.180
The American dream, is that what it was?

39:09.263 --> 39:12.725
And after he went to jail, you decided to
take it over and you became Amparo.

39:13.267 --> 39:16.479
Wow, that's a really
well crafted story, Slade.

39:16.562 --> 39:19.857
I applaud you.
Will someone handcuff this guy, already?

39:19.940 --> 39:23.819
No, I applaud you, because that
Cuban contact I gave you 10 years ago,

39:23.944 --> 39:27.031
was Anthony Alvez, not Estevez Crespo.

39:27.114 --> 39:29.450
Now, that's kind of curious
how you knew of today's contact

39:29.533 --> 39:31.994
even though you had no idea
that the ring was still happening.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.372
Whoa, whoa.

39:34.455 --> 39:37.124
Come on, what are you guys doing?
He's obviously lying.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.960
We were lying when we told you
this was a sting on Slade.

39:40.044 --> 39:42.088
Yeah, he filled us in
on everything last night.

39:42.171 --> 39:45.674
All we needed was the Cuban port contact
to end this ring in Cuba, too.

39:45.758 --> 39:48.135
Four days ago,
I get a call from Thanny Torres

39:48.219 --> 39:50.679
because she saw a person in the paper
with a branding.

39:50.763 --> 39:53.391
But she called you first.
Because she thought she could trust you.

39:53.474 --> 39:55.142
She wanted to tell you
that Amparo's ring was back,

39:55.393 --> 39:56.644
but by the time I picked her up...

39:56.727 --> 39:58.187
...at the police station, she was
terrified

39:58.270 --> 40:00.106
that you were trying to
silence her for some reason.

40:00.356 --> 40:02.400
-And you were.
-That phone call got her killed.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.860
You made it seem like she was
just another addict relapsing.

40:04.944 --> 40:06.862
You got her arrested for a false DUI.

40:06.946 --> 40:09.198
While in jail,
you contaminated her intoxilyzer.

40:09.281 --> 40:12.159
Thanny wasn't relapsing.
She was on to a new chapter of life,

40:12.243 --> 40:15.371
about to get married,
and you stole her life one last time.

40:15.454 --> 40:19.250
Okay, look, I know he's one of your own,
but this is just absurd.

40:19.333 --> 40:22.086
Because I know a name?
You guys got nothing, all right.

40:22.169 --> 40:23.170
Is your eye bothering you?

40:23.254 --> 40:26.257
Inflammation, itchiness,
marked lacrimation...

40:26.340 --> 40:28.259
See, that's what happens when you spend
a lot of time around these docks,

40:28.342 --> 40:29.260
with all these fumes.

40:29.343 --> 40:30.719
And here's the clincher.

40:30.803 --> 40:33.431
That chip you put in Yaselyn's neck
to track where she's been,

40:33.514 --> 40:36.308
had this address on it,
and it also had yours.

40:37.268 --> 40:40.020
You thought it was over ten years ago,
when you took me off the case.

40:41.188 --> 40:42.314
Now it's over.

40:43.149 --> 40:45.734
Did you really think you could
work with my people as bait,

40:45.818 --> 40:47.820
and force me into some sort of confession?

40:52.283 --> 40:54.660
Just blue to blue, I'm not going to
make you run for me.

40:54.743 --> 40:57.037
Good. I won't need to.

40:58.414 --> 41:00.875
Because blue to blue,
if you make one move,

41:01.333 --> 41:06.172
you'll feel the wrath of millions of women
who'd love to roast an animal like you.

41:07.423 --> 41:08.632
Lock this pig up.

41:13.762 --> 41:16.432
Barbara Dicasoli coming to you
live from the Miami ports,

41:16.599 --> 41:19.560
where a sting operation has taken down
a human trafficking ring,

41:19.894 --> 41:21.687
originating all the way in Cuba.

41:21.770 --> 41:24.857
Look, Slade,
I know we got into this last night,

41:24.940 --> 41:26.317
-but, again...
-Don't...

41:26.692 --> 41:28.527
I shouldn't have investigated alone.

41:28.777 --> 41:30.613
But, one wrong step and
I'd have taken you all down with me,

41:30.696 --> 41:32.198
and I just couldn't live with that.

41:32.281 --> 41:34.325
Every cop has that one case
that haunts them.

41:34.408 --> 41:37.244
You know, Ira, I hope you know I didn't
mean any of the things I said on the boat.

41:37.328 --> 41:39.163
I was just trying to get
your stubborn ass to leave.

41:39.246 --> 41:41.832
Oh, I know. But I got to hit you,
and that felt pretty good.

41:42.208 --> 41:44.460
I guess sometimes,
that's all you have to do to a brother.

41:44.543 --> 41:46.420
-We good?
-We're all good.

41:47.129 --> 41:48.797
And like they say... Team work!

41:48.881 --> 41:50.466
-No!
-What!

42:00.893 --> 42:02.603
You sent a doctor to my house?

42:02.686 --> 42:05.606
Yeah, I thought I'll call in a favor so
you don't have to wait in those VA lines.

42:05.689 --> 42:07.399
And what I said
about not needing your help.

42:08.484 --> 42:09.610
It's just a call.

42:10.736 --> 42:12.488
I'm not your charity case, Rosie.

42:13.280 --> 42:16.575
Look, Marcos, we're not in a battlefield.
So you might want to ease up.

42:18.327 --> 42:20.162
Is that an order?

42:20.913 --> 42:21.914
Huh?

42:21.997 --> 42:23.499
You ever been to Fallujah?

42:23.874 --> 42:25.543
You ever fired a weapon at an enemy?

42:25.626 --> 42:27.795
I outrank you there,
and I outrank you right here.

42:27.878 --> 42:30.172
I will tell you one more time.
Don't cross this bridge.

42:33.050 --> 42:34.593
You know what you are, Rosie?

42:35.177 --> 42:39.139
You're a pathologist with a weak-ass heart
who couldn't even protect his own sister.

42:39.473 --> 42:41.225
That's what I got from your little story.

42:42.893 --> 42:44.103
You know who you're looking at right now?

42:44.186 --> 42:47.147
Yeah, I'm looking at a man who got
dishonorably discharged from the army,

42:47.231 --> 42:50.025
and is about to get dishonorably
discharged from his own family,

42:50.109 --> 42:53.279
if he doesn't ease... up.

42:59.702 --> 43:00.703
Hey, hey, hey.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.079
Hey, get off him.

43:03.330 --> 43:04.915
-Guys, chill out.
-Whoa, whoa!

43:05.666 --> 43:07.042
Easy, come on.

43:11.755 --> 43:12.798
That's it.
