00:01.269 --> 00:03.437
NARRATOR: Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.471 --> 00:06.374
We're 170. We are definitely
sitting on something.

00:06.407 --> 00:09.343
RICK: The oscillator is on
a flat, hard surface.

00:09.377 --> 00:11.212
Could this be the vault?

00:11.245 --> 00:13.114
I found a ship's log.
"It has been agreed

00:13.147 --> 00:15.216
"that a deep pit be dug,
and treasure securely buried.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.784
"The pit to have
a secret entrance

00:16.817 --> 00:18.352
by a tunnel from the shore."

00:18.386 --> 00:20.354
There's a trail, now, to follow.

00:20.388 --> 00:21.755
It fits in every aspect.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.225
-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
-Holy...

00:24.258 --> 00:27.361
I've seen that shape before
in the Templar prison in France.

00:30.398 --> 00:34.502
NARRATOR: There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:34.535 --> 00:38.372
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.406 --> 00:40.841
for more than 200 years.

00:40.874 --> 00:44.478
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.512 --> 00:47.248
with strange symbols
carved into it,

00:47.281 --> 00:49.717
17th-century coins,

00:49.750 --> 00:52.653
even pieces of human bone.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.289
To date, six men have died

00:55.323 --> 00:56.690
trying to solve the mystery.

00:56.724 --> 00:59.860
And, according to legend,

00:59.893 --> 01:03.231
one more will have to die

01:03.264 --> 01:06.567
before the treasure
can be found.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.617
NARRATOR:
In their determination

01:23.651 --> 01:25.886
to find the spot where the
original Money Pit was first

01:25.919 --> 01:29.357
discovered back in 1795,

01:29.390 --> 01:31.625
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina

01:31.659 --> 01:34.728
have chosen a site
known simply as "H-8."

01:36.864 --> 01:40.801
RICK: Excavation depth
is right around 115 feet.

01:40.834 --> 01:44.672
MIKE J.: Yes. This wood slowed
us up... quite a bit, but

01:44.705 --> 01:46.807
it almost looks like they were
right dead center on the shaft.

01:46.840 --> 01:50.211
-Go ahead.
-And that's what fell in there.

01:50.244 --> 01:53.614
NARRATOR: Because
the Money Pit's exact location

01:53.647 --> 01:55.683
has been lost for decades,
and the area

01:55.716 --> 01:59.287
around it has been compromised
by more than two centuries

01:59.320 --> 02:01.422
of digging
and treasure-hunting,

02:01.455 --> 02:04.325
the Laginas
and their partners decided

02:04.358 --> 02:05.893
to locate their target
by employing

02:05.926 --> 02:08.929
what is known
as the "Geotech method."

02:08.962 --> 02:12.466
This involved the drilling
of more than three dozen

02:12.500 --> 02:15.336
six-inch-wide
exploratory boreholes

02:15.369 --> 02:18.672
down to depths
of as much as 200 feet.

02:18.706 --> 02:21.875
And it was by carefully
checking the spoils

02:21.909 --> 02:24.745
brought up from Borehole H-8
that the team found...

02:24.778 --> 02:27.381
-...a wad of parchment,

02:27.415 --> 02:29.650
along with a fragment

02:29.683 --> 02:32.653
of what was later identified
as book binding,

02:32.686 --> 02:35.523
a small piece of pottery
found below

02:35.556 --> 02:38.459
any previously-recorded
searcher depths,

02:38.492 --> 02:40.728
and two human bones.

02:40.761 --> 02:43.497
Human bones that, when tested,

02:43.531 --> 02:46.434
proved to be
from two individuals:

02:46.467 --> 02:51.705
one from Europe
and one from the Middle East.

02:51.739 --> 02:55.343
It's not advancing as fast as we
did yesterday, obviously, but...

02:55.376 --> 02:57.278
NARRATOR: Now, with
the Geotech process completed,

02:57.311 --> 02:59.247
the Laginas and their partners

02:59.280 --> 03:01.649
have brought in a team
from Irving Equipment, Limited.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.818
Using 60-inch-wide
drilling caissons,

03:04.852 --> 03:07.521
they will excavate
the H-8 drill site

03:07.555 --> 03:11.825
down to a target depth
of some 150 feet.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.562
If the Money Pit
is finally located,

03:14.595 --> 03:18.399
the Oak Island team may be
on the verge of finding out,

03:18.432 --> 03:21.535
once and for all,
if an incredible treasure

03:21.569 --> 03:25.473
was buried here
more than two centuries ago--

03:25.506 --> 03:29.377
a treasure that has, so far,
cost millions of dollars

03:29.410 --> 03:32.580
and at least six human lives
to find.

03:32.613 --> 03:33.981
MIKE J.:
We're rotating down,

03:34.014 --> 03:36.450
but every now and then,
we have to come up

03:36.484 --> 03:38.786
and clean our teeth out
because of the wood, right?

03:38.819 --> 03:40.788
You'll get tired
of hearing this, but Oak Island

03:40.821 --> 03:42.790
always seems to give you
a little bit of...

03:42.823 --> 03:44.292
-Oh, yes, it can't be easy.
-It can't be easy.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.026
Everybody'd be doing it.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.396
RICK: It's nothing that
we weren't aware of. I mean,

03:48.429 --> 03:50.698
-it's almost certainly
the Chappell Shaft. -Yeah. Yeah.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.701
NARRATOR:
In 1931,

03:53.734 --> 03:57.871
Oak Island treasure hunter M.R.
Chappell attempted to locate

03:57.905 --> 04:00.441
a mysterious,
seven-foot-tall wooden box

04:00.474 --> 04:02.876
that was first discovered
by his father,

04:02.910 --> 04:05.746
William Chappell, in 1897.

04:05.779 --> 04:09.817
It was this box-- later dubbed
the "Chappell Vault"--

04:09.850 --> 04:12.720
where bits of parchment
and traces of gold

04:12.753 --> 04:16.490
were reportedly found
on a drill bit.

04:16.524 --> 04:19.593
During an excavation effort
to retrieve the box,

04:19.627 --> 04:23.597
the hole flooded with seawater,
and the project was abandoned

04:23.631 --> 04:26.800
until some 34 years later

04:26.834 --> 04:29.036
when M.R. Chappell tried
and failed

04:29.069 --> 04:31.472
to reach the box by means

04:31.505 --> 04:34.508
of what is now known
as the "Chappell Shaft."

04:39.580 --> 04:41.949
MARTY: Lots of wood, Charles.
I see lots of wood.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.551
CHARLES:
You're right, Marty.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.786
-The Chappell Shaft.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.955
It's what it is.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.991
RICK: It's been nothing
but wood. No dirt.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.394
MARTY:
Solid wood coming up?

04:53.427 --> 04:55.095
Yeah, I think
it's-it's shredded, and then,

04:55.128 --> 04:57.064
-chunks, so then, no dirt.
-They're off their time...

04:57.097 --> 04:58.966
They're off their timetable.
Slowing 'em down a bit.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.769
Just a bit, because of the wood,

05:01.802 --> 05:03.704
but once we get through this,
we'll gain it back.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.806
So, hopefully, right?

05:05.839 --> 05:09.042
MARTY: What we're hoping is,
we're on the corner

05:09.076 --> 05:11.579
of the Chappell Shaft,
but they just missed.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.347
-Yeah. -Do you see anything
that looks like that

05:13.381 --> 05:14.948
We did, yeah. There was a couple
of timbers that we noticed,

05:14.982 --> 05:16.650
-that came... -Couple
of corner pieces like that?

05:16.684 --> 05:19.052
-Yeah. Yeah. -Okay.
-NARRATOR: If Marty is correct,

05:19.086 --> 05:20.521
and the team is digging

05:22.623 --> 05:24.792
through a portion
it might be a good sign.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.431
A few weeks ago,
while searching through records

05:30.464 --> 05:32.633
at a local historical society,

05:32.666 --> 05:36.604
Oak Island researcher Doug
Crowell discovered documents

05:36.637 --> 05:39.973
which indicated that, when
digging the Chappell Shaft,

05:40.007 --> 05:43.411
M.R. Chappell had veered
some ten feet off course,

05:43.444 --> 05:48.148
away from the last known
location of the Chappell Vault.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.584
At the depths
in which the Chappell Vault

05:50.618 --> 05:53.487
-was encountered...
-They would have missed it.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.489
-They would have missed it.
-Right.

05:55.523 --> 05:58.058
If we just dig
in the Chappell Shaft,

05:58.091 --> 06:01.895
we have zero chance of hitting
the so-called Chappell Vault

06:01.929 --> 06:03.864
because it would be explored.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.867
So, we're hoping the shaft is
sort of going this way,

06:06.900 --> 06:08.602
and our hole is going straight,

06:08.636 --> 06:10.771
and we're coming down
half in, half out.

06:10.804 --> 06:13.941
But eventually, we want
to get out of that shaft.

06:16.810 --> 06:21.515
RICK: When we're in the moment
where we want

06:21.549 --> 06:24.918
action, we want,
you know, the-the bit

06:24.952 --> 06:27.087
to get down a hole
and get us some answers--

06:27.120 --> 06:30.891
in that moment,
you realize that

06:30.924 --> 06:35.028
this is a frustrating process,
and one must be patient,

06:35.062 --> 06:37.064
and understand that, you know,

06:37.097 --> 06:40.568
you're not gonna get
immediate gratification.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.803
Hopefully,
before you get to 150,

06:42.836 --> 06:44.972
you go back
into undisturbed ground.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.807
-That would be
the best situation. -Yes.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.542
Yeah.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.680
NARRATOR:
As the Irving team continues

06:52.713 --> 06:54.582
to grind
the enormous steel caisson

06:54.615 --> 06:56.183
deeper into the Money Pit,

06:56.216 --> 07:00.087
Rick and Marty Lagina head
to the war room,

07:00.120 --> 07:03.090
where they and their team
have arranged to meet

07:03.123 --> 07:06.093
once again with Doug Crowell.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.696
Okay, guys, so, Doug is back.

07:08.729 --> 07:11.832
-I believe you've gone
to the Halifax archives. -Yup.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.802
-Fill us in. -I found
eight pages of a ship...

07:14.835 --> 07:16.236
what looks like a ship's log.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.673
These eight pages that I found,

07:19.707 --> 07:24.545
I made a transcript, guys, of-of
what the log actually says.

07:24.578 --> 07:27.481
What's really interesting is,
it appears

07:27.515 --> 07:29.617
to be a ship's log
that indicates that

07:29.650 --> 07:32.686
they were here in advance
of the French fleet

07:32.720 --> 07:36.724
that was coming over
in 1746 to take back Acadia.

07:36.757 --> 07:40.994
NARRATOR: In 1746,
the French launched an armada

07:41.028 --> 07:44.765
of 97 ships and 13,000 men--

07:44.798 --> 07:46.567
the largest fleet at the time

07:46.600 --> 07:48.235
to have ever crossed
the Atlantic--

07:48.268 --> 07:51.204
in an attempt
to seize Nova Scotia

07:51.238 --> 07:53.240
and parts of
the Northern American colonies

07:53.273 --> 07:55.609
from the British.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.245
Under the command
of the acclaimed French admiral

07:58.278 --> 08:01.248
Duc D'Anville, the great fleet
was bringing with it

08:01.281 --> 08:03.684
not only massive
military force,

08:03.717 --> 08:09.022
but also a vast treasure
of untold riches.

08:09.056 --> 08:12.993
However, some of the ships
in the Duc D'Anville's fleet--

08:13.026 --> 08:16.930
including his-- were delayed
and severely weakened

08:16.964 --> 08:19.867
during the long, three-month
journey by violent storms,

08:19.900 --> 08:24.271
as well as outbreaks
of typhus and scurvy.

08:24.304 --> 08:27.941
By the time the ships
made landfall in Canada,

08:27.975 --> 08:30.077
hundreds of sailors
and soldiers had died,

08:30.110 --> 08:33.246
including the Duc D'Anville.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.183
The planned siege
was soon abandoned,

08:36.216 --> 08:40.821
and the remaining ships were
ordered to return to France.

08:40.854 --> 08:46.193
They came over here to take back
Acadia, to burn Boston.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.228
You know, they were gonna come
over here and do as much

08:48.261 --> 08:49.897
damage as they could.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.632
Due to sickness and bad luck,

08:51.665 --> 08:53.100
basically,
they-they didn't accomplish

08:53.133 --> 08:55.769
any of those goals. Um,

08:55.803 --> 08:58.572
interestingly enough,
the Duc D'Anville--

08:58.606 --> 09:03.577
his real name was Jean-Baptiste
Louis Frederic de Rochefoucauld.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.779
NARRATOR:
Duc D'Anville?

09:05.813 --> 09:08.582
A member
of the Rochefoucauld family?

09:08.616 --> 09:10.718
The powerful and noble
French family

09:10.751 --> 09:13.020
dating back
to the tenth century

09:13.053 --> 09:16.289
and with possible connections
to the Knights Templar?

09:16.323 --> 09:18.859
Remember
the French Oak Island map

09:18.892 --> 09:20.961
that Zena showed us
last summer there?

09:20.994 --> 09:22.930
NARRATOR:
Two weeks ago, Doug Crowell

09:22.963 --> 09:24.832
presented the Oak Island team

09:24.865 --> 09:28.235
with astonishing
new information concerning

09:28.268 --> 09:31.805
a reported 14th-century
Templar map of Oak Island.

09:31.839 --> 09:34.842
If you recall, up
in the upper right-hand corner,

09:34.875 --> 09:37.611
a loose translation
of what was written there was,

09:37.645 --> 09:42.115
"A small gift for François
de La Rochefoucauld."

09:42.149 --> 09:44.785
Well, I've been following up
on that name.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.120
NARRATOR: It was this
information that prompted

09:47.154 --> 09:51.024
Rick and two of his nephews
to travel some 3,000 miles

09:51.058 --> 09:54.662
to Rochefoucauld Castle
in Southwest France.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.665
There, they met
with Sonia Matossian--

09:57.698 --> 10:00.367
a member
of the Rochefoucauld family--

10:00.400 --> 10:03.637
whose translation
of an ancient map suggested

10:03.671 --> 10:06.006
a possible link between
the Rochefoucauld family

10:06.039 --> 10:08.108
and Oak Island.

10:08.141 --> 10:11.845
RICK: Is that translation
accurately presented there?

10:11.879 --> 10:14.882
"François de La--
François de La Rochefoucauld.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.050
A little drink..."

10:20.120 --> 10:23.156
It means "towards."
It doesn't mean "a drink."

10:23.190 --> 10:27.194
-Towards the west. -Towards
the... towards the west.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.096
NARRATOR:
Could the Duc D'Anville--

10:29.129 --> 10:31.031
a member
of the Rochefoucauld family--

10:31.064 --> 10:34.034
have also known about this map?

10:34.067 --> 10:35.969
And, if so, might there
have been another,

10:36.003 --> 10:39.006
more strategic purpose,
behind his voyage

10:39.039 --> 10:43.744
to Nova Scotia in 1746?

10:43.777 --> 10:47.414
They were waiting on
Duc D'Anville's fleet to arrive,

10:47.447 --> 10:49.182
and if you go through
these eight pages,

10:49.216 --> 10:51.018
they're actually talking about

10:51.051 --> 10:52.820
the vast amount of treasure
they have on board.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.454
They're worried about losing it,

10:54.487 --> 10:56.023
because, basically,
they're in enemy territory.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.992
So, this transcription
I've handed out to you,

10:59.026 --> 11:00.761
I'm just going to read through
it really quickly here.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.030
"September 6.

11:03.063 --> 11:06.700
Enter a deep bay,
southwesterly of Chebucto Bay."

11:06.734 --> 11:08.836
So where is Chebucto Bay?

11:08.869 --> 11:11.939
-DOUG: Chebucto Bay is now
Halifax Harbor.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.807
That was the original name
that the French had given

11:13.841 --> 11:15.142
to Halifax Harbor.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.711
So, on September 6,

11:17.745 --> 11:19.980
the ship's log was,
"Still no word of D'Anville,

11:20.013 --> 11:22.315
"and the weather being clear,

11:22.349 --> 11:26.453
"we set sail turning
southwesterly along the coast,

11:26.486 --> 11:29.990
"passing many rocky islands.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.893
"At midday, we reach a deep bay.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.862
"With several hundred
small islands,

11:34.895 --> 11:37.164
"wooded to the shore.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.733
"The wind dying down,
we anchored for the night.

11:39.767 --> 11:43.804
"The great quantity of treasure
on this vessel makes it unwise

11:43.837 --> 11:46.740
"to jeopardize it in
any engagement with the enemy.

11:46.774 --> 11:50.844
"September 8. It has been agreed
that a deep pit be dug

11:50.878 --> 11:52.746
"and treasure securely buried.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.514
"The pit to have
a secret entrance

11:54.547 --> 11:56.817
by a tunnel from the shore."

11:56.850 --> 11:59.519
On September 13,
"Down 67 feet.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.122
"Pit seems damp
from seepage of seawater.

12:02.155 --> 12:05.826
Have decided to go deeper
to dry soil."

12:05.859 --> 12:07.761
MARTY:
Then it ends.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.763
-And that's where it ends.
-CRAIG: But it is amazing.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.198
I mean,
a great quantity of treasure,

12:11.231 --> 12:15.102
and-and that they appear to be
in this bay.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.870
In my mind,
there's no doubt that they're

12:16.904 --> 12:18.238
pointing right to Oak Island.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.881
DOUG: "It has been agreed
that a deep pit be dug

12:27.915 --> 12:29.449
and treasure securely buried."

12:29.482 --> 12:32.085
What troubles me
is how perfect this is.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.954
NARRATOR:
While meeting in the war room,

12:33.987 --> 12:36.523
researcher Doug Crowell
has just presented

12:36.556 --> 12:39.827
Rick, Marty, and the team
with a transcript

12:39.860 --> 12:42.930
of an 18th-century
military ship log

12:42.963 --> 12:45.933
detailing the burial
of treasure on an island

12:45.966 --> 12:48.201
with an eerily similar
description to that

12:48.235 --> 12:52.405
of Oak Island
and its infamous Money Pit.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.574
I mean, it fits in every aspect.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.043
Exactly.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.945
As the ship's log unfolds,

12:57.978 --> 13:00.447
it describes a construction
of a shaft

13:00.480 --> 13:04.084
very similar
to the d-descriptions

13:04.117 --> 13:06.453
of the original find
of the Money Pit.

13:06.486 --> 13:09.056
I think it's-it's... it fits.

13:09.089 --> 13:12.325
The thing about this
that-that makes it exciting

13:12.359 --> 13:14.294
is that it fits really well.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.229
Could it lead to some more

13:16.263 --> 13:18.465
investigative work? Absolutely.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.100
Doug, this is, uh, incredible.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.268
Incredibly fascinating.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.136
And whether it ties or not,

13:23.170 --> 13:25.138
it's a really interesting bit
of history.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.941
Not only that, but there's
a trail, now, to follow.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.910
You know where this came from.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.445
You know there's-there's
an incredible amount of material

13:32.479 --> 13:34.081
left to go through.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.316
-Right. -So,
the information hunt continues.

13:36.349 --> 13:39.086
NARRATOR:
Could this ship's log,

13:39.119 --> 13:43.323
dated some 50 years before
the discovery of the Money Pit,

13:43.356 --> 13:47.527
be an account of the treasure
shaft's original construction?

13:47.560 --> 13:50.463
And could the Duc D'Anville,

13:50.497 --> 13:53.200
a member
of the Rochefoucauld family,

13:53.233 --> 13:55.568
have chosen Oak Island
for his destination

13:55.602 --> 13:57.637
because he had secret knowledge

13:57.670 --> 14:00.573
that his family had been
storing valuables on the site

14:00.607 --> 14:04.144
since the days
of the Knights Templar?

14:04.177 --> 14:06.546
It's a Rochefoucauld connection.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.982
The Rochefoucauld that was
leading the expedition dies.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.184
-ALEX: Mm-hmm. -Duc D'Anville,
who was leading the expedition,

14:11.218 --> 14:13.120
was a Rochefoucauld.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.255
It's the Francis Rochefoucauld
on Zena's map

14:15.288 --> 14:17.224
that's given information
about Oak Island

14:17.257 --> 14:19.459
and-and what looks
like a buried treasure.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.995
Was that...
Did that drive out of this story

14:22.029 --> 14:23.897
of this-this French log

14:23.931 --> 14:27.100
and that was drawn up
to send word back to the family?

14:27.134 --> 14:29.536
That's what I would think
is most likely.

14:29.569 --> 14:33.106
Again, the information hunt
is-is important.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.675
It gets us from-from archival

14:35.708 --> 14:38.178
to boots on the ground
at the Money Pit.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.947
Absolutely.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.982
There's a treasure trove here
of information.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.984
Will it prove to be relevant
to Oak Island?

14:44.017 --> 14:47.287
I don't know that. But in
my opinion, we must follow it.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.356
Hey, Doug,
excellent job, as always.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.658
It's very intriguing.
This is interesting stuff.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.127
It leads
to a whole bunch more avenues,

14:54.161 --> 14:55.996
as Rick often says, to explore.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.630
-Well done.
-Yeah. Thank you.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.299
-Okay. Let's go.
-Appreciate it.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.268
*

15:07.607 --> 15:10.277
NARRATOR:
As the massive excavation

15:10.310 --> 15:13.680
of the H-8 drill site
in the Money Pit continues,

15:13.713 --> 15:15.648
Rick Lagina arrives,

15:15.682 --> 15:18.585
eager to find out
if the team has dug down

15:18.618 --> 15:21.121
beyond remnants
of an old searcher shaft

15:21.154 --> 15:23.623
and into soil
where they hope to reach

15:23.656 --> 15:26.259
the fabled
Chappell treasure vault.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.397
VANESSA:
Our team did it again.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.566
We are exactly at all of your
marks that you wanted us at.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.603
The casing is at 155 exactly.

15:36.636 --> 15:40.273
The grab excavation
is down to 150 exactly.

15:40.307 --> 15:45.145
Okay, 155 can depth,
150 excavation depth.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.280
The anomaly...

15:47.314 --> 15:49.216
160, give or take.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.184
-160. Okay.
-The next ten feet,

15:51.218 --> 15:53.386
what we need to do
is really watch the pressures.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.355
Okay.

15:55.388 --> 15:58.491
NARRATOR: When Borehole H-8
was first drilled

15:58.525 --> 16:00.260
several weeks ago...

16:00.293 --> 16:01.728
-Yeah.

16:01.761 --> 16:04.564
...a large metallic anomaly
was identified

16:04.597 --> 16:07.434
by a dual induction
metal detection device

16:07.467 --> 16:11.704
at a depth
of approximately 160 feet.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.041
We're picking something else up
right here,

16:14.074 --> 16:16.776
which would put it
very near the vault.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.612
Because we don't want to break
through something aggressively.

16:19.646 --> 16:23.283
The hope would be that it's in,
you know, 150 to 160.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.718
-We don't make a mistake.
-Yeah, for sure.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.754
We want everyone's blessing
to proceed from here.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.157
This is, you know...
We know this is really important

16:30.190 --> 16:32.659
-to you guys and to this whole
project and research. -It is.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.761
And we're gonna work
and go as slow

16:34.794 --> 16:36.729
-and as gingerly as possible.
-Well, that's why...

16:36.763 --> 16:38.231
that's why we're here,
to find it.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.133
Great job.
-Okay.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.568
-Thank you, Vanessa.
-Thank you.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.270
RICK:
So, the hope is that,

16:43.303 --> 16:46.173
because of the clues
in the small-diameter hole,

16:46.206 --> 16:47.807
that, as the can goes down,

16:47.840 --> 16:51.378
there will be s-something
to hold in our hands.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.781
NARRATOR:
Now that the casing oscillator

16:54.814 --> 16:57.550
has driven the 60-inch-wide
temporary caisson

16:57.584 --> 17:01.621
to a depth of 155 feet,

17:01.654 --> 17:04.791
the team will begin
carefully searching the spoils

17:04.824 --> 17:07.594
for what could be
valuable evidence.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.065
As each load of spoils
are brought up

17:12.099 --> 17:14.734
by the seven-ton
hammer grab tool,

17:14.767 --> 17:18.205
they will be transported
to a designated area

17:18.238 --> 17:21.774
where metal detection expert
Gary Drayton will scan them,

17:21.808 --> 17:24.277
looking for artifacts.

17:26.813 --> 17:30.317
Then the same spoils
will be carefully sifted

17:30.350 --> 17:34.354
using the team's custom-built
four-by-eight-foot wash table.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.391
JACK:
All right, open the valve!

17:39.892 --> 17:42.095
That's better.

17:42.129 --> 17:44.197
MARTY: We need to look
at what comes out

17:44.231 --> 17:46.366
of the H-8 dig very carefully.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.600
We need to look for metal.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.202
We need to look for things

17:49.236 --> 17:50.770
that are only visually located,

17:50.803 --> 17:52.639
like pottery
or pieces of leather

17:52.672 --> 17:54.374
or parchment
or things like that.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.808
-Bone.
-Bone.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.479
It's a work in progress.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.080
We have to do it right.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.821
GARY:
That's good. That's a signal.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.192
Huh?

18:12.225 --> 18:14.194
Now I'm having fun.

18:14.227 --> 18:17.564
You are a...
indefatigable metal detector.

18:17.597 --> 18:21.134
You never know what's gonna come
out with the next handful.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.470
Hopefully you.

18:23.503 --> 18:24.871
Yeah.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.706
It's in my hand.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.741
Let's separate it.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.610
So, whatever it is, it's there.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.245
It's a shard.

18:32.279 --> 18:37.417
Some kind
of square, spike-type thing.

18:38.685 --> 18:41.821
One little Hail Mary.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.825
Well, that's a good sign!

18:45.858 --> 18:47.727
That's a strong signal.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.898
That's good.
That's another signal.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.233
Wow!

18:53.266 --> 18:55.835
What the heck is this?

18:55.868 --> 18:58.371
MARTY:
What is that? Let's see it.

19:03.843 --> 19:06.179
*

19:06.213 --> 19:07.947
GARY:
What the heck is this?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.749
MARTY:
What is that?

19:09.782 --> 19:11.484
NARRATOR:
At the Oak Island Money Pit...

19:11.518 --> 19:13.820
-Let's see it.
-...Marty and Rick Lagina,

19:13.853 --> 19:16.923
along with metal detection
expert Gary Drayton,

19:16.956 --> 19:19.492
have just made
an exciting discovery

19:19.526 --> 19:22.262
while searching the H-8 spoils.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.963
GARY:
That's a big, old chunky spike.

19:23.996 --> 19:27.500
That's an oldie as well.
That's raw iron.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.702
That came from 150.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.504
That-that might be concrete.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.206
You might want to leave that
on there.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.974
NARRATOR:
Concrete?

19:35.007 --> 19:39.312
On an iron spike found
at a depth of 150 feet

19:39.346 --> 19:41.248
in the Money Pit area?

19:41.281 --> 19:43.516
When treasure hunters
William Chappell

19:43.550 --> 19:45.785
and Frederick Blair
first drilled

19:45.818 --> 19:49.656
into the so-called
Chappell Vault in 1897,

19:49.689 --> 19:53.693
it appeared to be covered
in a concrete-like substance.

19:53.726 --> 19:56.329
I mean, after all the work
that we've done here,

19:56.363 --> 19:57.730
this is the culmination.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.732
It may be the beginning

19:59.766 --> 20:01.834
of finally, finally getting
some answers.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.503
And that's the hope.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.272
NARRATOR:
Could this spike be a piece

20:05.305 --> 20:06.839
of the original Chappell Vault?

20:06.873 --> 20:08.741
And, if so, could it mean

20:08.775 --> 20:10.710
that the team is moments away

20:10.743 --> 20:13.446
from finding actual proof
that they have at last reached

20:13.480 --> 20:15.415
the Oak Island Money Pit?

20:15.448 --> 20:17.784
MARTY:
Okay. Let's make some hole.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.593
MARTY:
We're about to get

20:26.626 --> 20:28.328
to the interesting stuff
here today.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.897
Finally. You know,
it's been a long process.

20:30.930 --> 20:34.601
The next ten feet, that's where
we start getting interested

20:34.634 --> 20:35.768
in the spoils.
And we're looking

20:35.802 --> 20:37.003
at all of them.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.372
Get another load?

20:44.677 --> 20:45.845
Well, how you feeling?

20:45.878 --> 20:47.680
Ner-Nervous.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.617
You know, there's got
to be something there.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.919
By something, I mean
it could just be more bones,

20:52.952 --> 20:55.888
could be more leather. But...

20:55.922 --> 21:00.393
it's hard to think that that
dual induction log was wrong.

21:00.427 --> 21:03.296
There's got to be... You'd think
there'd be s-something there.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.897
What was that depth?
Aren't we there right now?

21:04.931 --> 21:06.766
Yeah. 158, 160.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.335
We're not there yet.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.303
Just about.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.475
JACK:
There's a lot more, uh,

21:15.508 --> 21:16.976
hand-chopped wood in here.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.378
-I see that.
-One of the big pieces had

21:18.411 --> 21:20.847
a couple... hack marks on it.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.584
GARY: I'm surprised
you could see anything,

21:24.617 --> 21:26.085
going through this stuff.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.588
JACK:
Yeah, that's coal.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.690
Is this part of a bone?

21:33.092 --> 21:35.728
You know something?
You're right. That is a bone.

21:35.762 --> 21:38.498
-Yeah, that's a bone.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.833
Good eye, Jack.

21:40.867 --> 21:43.803
Hey, Lagina brothers,
I got something to show you.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.738
Bone.

21:45.772 --> 21:49.442
-Yeah.
-That is definitely bone.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.344
Find a lot of it, or...?

21:51.378 --> 21:52.945
JACK:
It's the first piece.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.881
Everyone else is still looking,
but...

21:54.914 --> 21:56.883
-Well, then... -I figured you
guys would want to see first.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.751
-I'm coming over. I'm gonna
help. : All right.

21:58.785 --> 22:02.522
NARRATOR: Bone? Could it be
another piece of bone

22:02.555 --> 22:04.424
from one
of the 17th-century individuals

22:04.457 --> 22:08.728
whose remains were found
in H

22:08.761 --> 22:10.997
RICK: We found book binding,
we found parchment,

22:11.030 --> 22:13.933
we found pottery at
great depth, and not only that,

22:13.966 --> 22:17.470
but we have science showing us
there's an anomaly here.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.972
JACK:
You guys find any more yet?

22:20.006 --> 22:22.542
-Pottery and a piece of glass.
-All right!

22:22.575 --> 22:24.911
GARY:
What the heck is that?

22:24.944 --> 22:27.447
-JACK: I think it's an old nail.
-DAVE: We got pottery

22:27.480 --> 22:30.116
right here, guys.

22:30.149 --> 22:32.385
MARTY:
We haven't found a vault yet.

22:32.419 --> 22:34.821
There's a lot more room.
That's the optimist part.

22:34.854 --> 22:39.692
But the realist part says,
"Well,

22:39.726 --> 22:41.561
a little less room."

22:41.594 --> 22:43.630
GARY:
It was a lot in that.

22:43.663 --> 22:45.832
-That big chunk. -JACK: Let's
keep our eyes peeled.

22:51.971 --> 22:54.674
Aw. Might come up
with it, huh

22:54.707 --> 22:57.043
NARRATOR:
Suddenly,

22:57.076 --> 23:00.046
it appears that something
out of the ordinary

23:00.079 --> 23:01.914
is occurring
with the oscillator.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.483
-MAN: No.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.754
Let's get Marty.

23:07.787 --> 23:09.656
VANESSA:
So, uh,

23:09.689 --> 23:11.691
we just came over
to check with Dan,

23:11.724 --> 23:14.461
and he says his pressures
right now are up to 150,

23:14.494 --> 23:16.663
and he feels like
he's sitting on something.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.931
-Yeah.

23:18.965 --> 23:22.068
NARRATOR: The fact that the
oscillator is now circulating

23:22.101 --> 23:25.204
at a torque pressure
of 150 bar--

23:25.237 --> 23:29.476
the equivalent of approximately
2,200 pounds per square inch--

23:29.509 --> 23:33.780
means it's operating at nearly
double its normal pressure,

23:33.813 --> 23:36.916
and is unable to cut through
whatever lies beneath it.

23:36.949 --> 23:40.119
DANNY: We're 170,
pipe in the ground right now.

23:40.152 --> 23:42.889
We are definitely sitting
on something that...

23:42.922 --> 23:45.492
we haven't cut before,
since we've been on this job.

23:45.525 --> 23:47.627
It don't feel like metal.

23:47.660 --> 23:50.763
It feels like I'm on a whole
bunch of wood at once now.

23:50.797 --> 23:54.567
NARRATOR:
A large wooden object?

23:54.601 --> 23:59.506
Could the caisson have finally
located the Chappell Vault,

23:59.539 --> 24:03.042
and in so doing, have found
the Oak Island Money Pit?

24:03.075 --> 24:06.946
Let me...
let me go grab Rick real quick.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.482
-He's at 82.

24:09.516 --> 24:11.718
I really need to talk
to you right now.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.019
Something going on down there.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.788
He's on something. He's...

24:15.822 --> 24:18.625
It's way different, he said.
He's at 170 feet.

24:18.658 --> 24:21.093
He thinks it's perfectly flat,

24:21.127 --> 24:23.162
-and...

24:23.195 --> 24:25.498
He thinks wood. He's not sure.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.500
-All right, let's see.
-Yeah.

24:27.534 --> 24:30.603
RICK:
The oscillator is on a flat,

24:30.637 --> 24:32.171
hard surface.

24:32.204 --> 24:34.674
That's exactly
what we hoped to encounter.

24:34.707 --> 24:37.243
Is there a vault below that?
I don't know.

24:37.276 --> 24:40.179
NARRATOR: Now that they have
found what could be

24:40.212 --> 24:44.083
an actual treasure vault,
Rick, Marty and the team

24:44.116 --> 24:47.787
must decide how best
to safely dig further

24:47.820 --> 24:50.022
and reveal
what it might contain.

24:50.056 --> 24:53.159
Okay, so what are you...
what are you feeling?

24:53.192 --> 24:55.094
What's what?

24:55.127 --> 24:58.565
So, since we...
since we started this shaft,

24:58.598 --> 25:00.867
this is different.

25:00.900 --> 25:03.035
I'm probably three inches into

25:03.069 --> 25:05.271
-whatever I'm cutting on, but...

25:05.304 --> 25:09.041
And it seems to me
it can definitely be cut.

25:09.075 --> 25:11.944
Uh, it might take a while,
but like I was saying,

25:11.978 --> 25:15.848
I'm exactly where I was supposed
to stop right now.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.218
MARTY:
You're going to run out of pipe.

25:19.251 --> 25:21.888
-This is just an idea.
-Yeah.

25:21.921 --> 25:24.156
So, we leave this,
use the permanent

25:24.190 --> 25:26.192
that has all the teeth on it

25:26.225 --> 25:29.729
to saw through what we're sawing
through, if you guys want?

25:29.762 --> 25:32.331
MARTY:
We're excited.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.300
We know
that the Money Pit collapsed,

25:34.333 --> 25:37.169
so this could be the vault
that has moved downward,

25:37.203 --> 25:39.171
but we have to make a decision.

25:39.205 --> 25:42.174
If we break through to a void,
what are we going to do?

25:42.208 --> 25:44.143
Send a diver down?
Send cameras down?

25:44.176 --> 25:47.814
The decision really comes down
to what's going to be

25:47.847 --> 25:49.081
less disruptive.

25:49.115 --> 25:51.751
-Hey, guys. -Hey.
-Hey, guys.

25:51.784 --> 25:53.753
What a bloody-ass mess.

25:53.786 --> 25:56.222
So, we ran out of water.

25:56.255 --> 25:58.858
We went
through the 7,000 gallons,

25:58.891 --> 26:01.193
-plus the extra 3,000 gallons.
-6,000 gallons.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.863
: What? You can't
take me seriously right now?

26:03.896 --> 26:05.197
:
No. No.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.867
Hey, I-I accomplished a lot.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.637
MARTY: No. You did a hell
of a job today, pure and simple.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.739
And every... everybody did.
Everybody had put in a full day.

26:12.772 --> 26:15.174
-Yeah. -But we need
to have a war room meeting.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.209
Just a quick one before
we call it a complete day.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.178
You know, if you can get
cleaned up as best you can

26:19.211 --> 26:20.747
-to be comfortable.
-Yeah. Well...

26:20.780 --> 26:22.915
And then we can all meet
in the war room,

26:22.949 --> 26:24.651
and just kick
a few things around.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.285
A lot happened today.
Let's go talk about it.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.254
Let's go.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.332
NARRATOR:
After a tense and exciting day

26:40.366 --> 26:42.735
of excavations
at the Oak Island Money Pit,

26:42.769 --> 26:45.037
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina,

26:45.071 --> 26:47.106
along with members
of their team,

26:47.139 --> 26:50.943
have gathered in the war room
for a critical meeting.

26:50.977 --> 26:54.013
Now that the 60-inch-wide
drilling caisson

26:54.046 --> 26:56.916
in Borehole H-8 has reached

26:56.949 --> 26:59.385
what could very well be
the fabled Chappell Vault

26:59.418 --> 27:03.022
at a depth of 170 feet,
they must determine

27:03.055 --> 27:07.093
how best to continue
their exploration of the area.

27:07.126 --> 27:11.798
Gentlemen, it's been a long,
long day.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.199
Everybody worked really hard.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.234
So, let's have a little recap.

27:15.267 --> 27:17.670
-We reached 170 with the can.
-Yeah.

27:17.704 --> 27:21.273
In true Oak Island fashion,

27:21.307 --> 27:24.076
right at the end of the day,
at 170 feet,

27:24.110 --> 27:27.146
Danny, the oscillator operator,
said he had a marked change.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.281
It was like nothing
that happened all day.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.351
The torque went up,
it was hard to drive the can.

27:32.384 --> 27:35.988
He thought, most significantly
to me, it was on something flat.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.460
Something, you know, flat and
consistent like this tabletop,

27:41.493 --> 27:44.396
like he was trying to drag the
can right across this tabletop.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.398
-He thinks

27:46.432 --> 27:49.268
-probably wood. -TERRY: Well,
the idea that we're on

27:49.301 --> 27:51.137
something relatively solid--
that's great.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.773
We're deeper than the...
right now

27:53.806 --> 27:54.974
than the Chappell Shaft
ever went.

27:57.844 --> 28:01.047
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
the team has finally excavated

28:01.080 --> 28:03.282
below the remains
of the searcher shaft

28:03.315 --> 28:06.753
installed by M.R. Chappell
in 1931

28:06.786 --> 28:11.924
and have finally located
the mysterious Chappell Vault?

28:11.958 --> 28:15.061
What was the big hit at 157?

28:15.094 --> 28:18.030
What's that conductivity reading
that Mike West showed us?

28:18.064 --> 28:19.932
-Should be still in that pile.
-Yeah.

28:19.966 --> 28:23.502
We were most interested
in 150 to 170, basically.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.972
-Right. -Have we searched
those cuttings yet?

28:26.005 --> 28:28.474
-Not all of them.

28:28.507 --> 28:30.376
Do you know
which ones we have or haven't?

28:30.409 --> 28:32.745
We just started on 156
when we ran out of water.

28:32.779 --> 28:34.781
MARTY:
So, actually,

28:34.814 --> 28:38.084
as we sit here around
this table, we don't really know

28:38.117 --> 28:40.419
what we got in the zone
of interest yet.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.388
Well, that's pretty cool.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.858
MARTY:
Okay, so we haven't searched it.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.293
David, your big bag of coins

28:47.326 --> 28:49.261
-is still out there
buried in clay. -Yup.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.230
So, we'll search those cuttings,
and then we'll know

28:51.263 --> 28:54.033
if there's something not quite
so massive that we missed.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.467
The real question is, Rick,

28:55.501 --> 28:58.871
what do you want to do
about drilling H

28:58.905 --> 29:00.239
I don't think we have a choice.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.208
I think
we put the permanent down

29:02.241 --> 29:05.878
and we...
slowly advance the casing.

29:05.912 --> 29:08.815
I mean, there is
no alternative at this point.

29:08.848 --> 29:10.416
-If you dig...
-And then hammer grab.

29:10.449 --> 29:12.218
Unfortunately, yes.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.420
There is no alternative.
We're committed.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.524
NARRATOR:
To reduce the risks

29:18.557 --> 29:22.561
of damaging any potentially
priceless artifacts,

29:22.594 --> 29:26.799
the team has chosen to install
a permanent inner casing.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.904
This will allow them to do
even deeper drilling

29:31.938 --> 29:35.107
and possible human exploration.

29:35.141 --> 29:38.377
Some of these things
that have been speculated about

29:38.410 --> 29:40.179
are... are irreplaceable.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.181
It could be priceless documents.

29:42.214 --> 29:44.516
It could be religious artifacts.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.919
And so, there's-there's
significant trepidation

29:46.953 --> 29:50.089
on my part-- fear, if you will--
that we may damage something.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.557
MARTY:
All right, what else?

29:51.590 --> 29:53.092
Anybody have anything else?
I mean, we...

29:53.125 --> 29:55.895
Tomorrow we-we get more answers.
I was hoping

29:55.928 --> 29:58.865
-they'd happen today.
So did you. -Yeah.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.466
We're hopeful
that we're close to answers.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.368
We've spent an awful lot
of effort

30:02.401 --> 30:04.203
to bring in
this massive equipment

30:04.236 --> 30:08.207
and dig in this one spot,

30:08.240 --> 30:12.278
following a well that produced
all kinds of tantalizing clues.

30:12.311 --> 30:13.479
So, yeah, we're hopeful.
We're getting to the depth

30:13.512 --> 30:15.381
where there should be answers.

30:15.414 --> 30:18.084
Ten years ago, we were hopeful
and that hasn't stopped.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.086
Gentlemen, it's been a long day.

30:20.119 --> 30:22.388
Everybody worked really hard.

30:22.421 --> 30:24.991
We've had the peaks and valleys
associated with Oak Island.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.592
We need a bigger peak tomorrow.

30:26.625 --> 30:29.528
Everybody needs some sleep.
Let's call it a day.

30:29.561 --> 30:31.998
DAVE:
Meeting adjourned.

30:37.603 --> 30:40.907
NARRATOR:
A new day begins on Oak Island,

30:40.940 --> 30:43.609
and as a permanent steel casing

30:43.642 --> 30:46.645
is installed
in the newly-dug H-8 shaft,

30:46.678 --> 30:50.616
Rick Lagina and metal detection
expert Gary Drayton

30:50.649 --> 30:53.219
are taking advantage
of an all-too-rare moment

30:53.252 --> 30:57.189
of free time to explore
an area of Smith's Cove.

30:57.223 --> 30:58.925
So much work has been done
down here,

30:58.958 --> 31:00.459
between Dan, the Restalls.

31:00.492 --> 31:02.895
Every... every company
that came out tried

31:02.929 --> 31:04.396
to figure out what was going on

31:04.430 --> 31:06.966
with the-the salt water
in the Money Pit.

31:06.999 --> 31:09.435
GARY: I mean, this is
an ideal situation, Rick,

31:09.468 --> 31:11.270
because, obviously,
it's low tide.

31:11.303 --> 31:14.206
-Mm-hmm.
-We got these rock pools.

31:14.240 --> 31:17.176
-See, if anything got washed
in and out of here... -Mm-hmm.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.178
...it's going to get trapped
in these rocks.

31:19.211 --> 31:22.148
-This is an ideal situation.
-So, you're thinking between

31:22.181 --> 31:23.515
-the beach
and the old cofferdams? -Yeah.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.251
This is a perfect spot?

31:25.284 --> 31:28.354
So, let's see
if we can find something.

31:28.387 --> 31:30.556
RICK:
When Gary decides

31:30.589 --> 31:33.692
he wants to investigate an area,
I-I defer to him.

31:33.725 --> 31:36.528
He has an incredible amount
of experience,

31:36.562 --> 31:38.564
and the beach is fascinating,
the inner tidal zone.

31:38.597 --> 31:41.433
Maybe the ground
in Smith's Cove has been

31:41.467 --> 31:43.069
disturbed enough that maybe

31:43.102 --> 31:45.637
something has come close
to surface.

31:45.671 --> 31:49.608
NARRATOR: It was at
Smith's Cove where, in 1850,

31:49.641 --> 31:51.643
searchers
from the Truro Company

31:51.677 --> 31:55.447
discovered the remains
of five stone box drains,

31:55.481 --> 31:58.717
each converging into
a single tunnel that appeared

31:58.750 --> 32:01.587
to head straight toward
the Oak Island Money Pit.

32:01.620 --> 32:04.356
They concluded that
these drains were constructed

32:04.390 --> 32:07.626
as part of
an elaborate booby-trap system,

32:07.659 --> 32:10.496
designed to frustrate
the efforts of anyone

32:10.529 --> 32:13.565
who tried to search
in the area for treasure.

32:13.599 --> 32:18.004
Last year, while trying to find
evidence of these box drains,

32:18.037 --> 32:20.272
Rick, Marty,
and members of their team

32:20.306 --> 32:22.641
found something
even more curious

32:22.674 --> 32:26.645
and possibly much older
than the Money Pit itself:

32:26.678 --> 32:28.614
a French drain,

32:28.647 --> 32:31.050
a formation of layered rocks

32:31.083 --> 32:34.086
used to divert
and control the flow of water.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.722
I'm gonna put you
on the spot now.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.524
Man

32:38.557 --> 32:40.726
LAIRD: The sorting of the rocks
is unusual.

32:40.759 --> 32:43.095
It's definitely what we'd call
cultural. Yeah.

32:43.129 --> 32:45.264
-Um... -Okay.
You mean you're saying, with...

32:45.297 --> 32:48.334
based on your expertise, with
certainty, this is placed here?

32:48.367 --> 32:49.635
It's a man

32:49.668 --> 32:51.503
-I believe so, yeah. Yeah.
-Wow.

32:54.673 --> 32:57.676
What we'll do,
we'll go up and down

32:57.709 --> 33:00.046
in this little area here,

33:00.079 --> 33:02.314
-work our way towards the rock.
-Okay.

33:10.289 --> 33:12.524
That's worth digging, Rick.

33:15.261 --> 33:17.696
Wow, compared to inland,
this is like a picnic, digging,

33:17.729 --> 33:19.165
-Yeah, really.

33:22.068 --> 33:23.735
Ah, let's see what this is.

33:23.769 --> 33:26.305
-It's out.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.174
I'll use my pinpointer, Rick.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.048
RICK:
What is it?

33:36.082 --> 33:39.585
Yeah. Typical find on the beach.

33:39.618 --> 33:43.155
-Yeah.
-Bottle cap.

33:43.189 --> 33:46.225
It's the right color, but...

33:46.258 --> 33:48.394
wrong material.

34:00.506 --> 34:02.141
Another one here, Rick.

34:02.174 --> 34:04.776
It's good depth.
It's saying ten inches.

34:16.188 --> 34:17.789
Whoa! Whoa, whoa,

34:17.823 --> 34:20.192
-whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:20.226 --> 34:23.129
-I don't see anything.
-I see something.

34:28.434 --> 34:30.302
Holy...

34:30.336 --> 34:33.239
Holy schmoly, all right.

34:33.272 --> 34:36.508
-RICK: It's a cross.
-That's a cross.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.710
There's a square hole.

34:38.744 --> 34:41.647
Yeah, right there.
It's heavy, too.

34:41.680 --> 34:46.152
Oh, my gosh. I mean,
that is an old, old cross.

34:47.253 --> 34:49.321
NARRATOR:
A cross?

34:49.355 --> 34:51.790
Located in the same area
where the team found

34:51.823 --> 34:53.659
French drains at Smith's Cove?

34:53.692 --> 34:55.861
But how did it get there?

34:55.894 --> 34:58.564
And how long did it lie buried?

34:58.597 --> 35:01.300
RICK:
Gary was extremely excited.

35:01.333 --> 35:04.336
-Sweet! -More excited
than anything he's ever found

35:04.370 --> 35:06.505
on the island. And mind you,
now, this year he's found coins

35:06.538 --> 35:09.575
from the late 1600s.

35:09.608 --> 35:12.344
Those finds pale in comparison
to this one,

35:12.378 --> 35:14.180
in terms
of his excitement level.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.448
So I'm excited
because Gary's excited,

35:16.482 --> 35:17.849
and that's the truth of it.

35:17.883 --> 35:19.651
Uh, it looks like it's lead.

35:19.685 --> 35:22.154
I always ask that.
-Look at that.

35:22.188 --> 35:24.623
-That is... Oh, my gosh.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.325
That is...

35:26.358 --> 35:28.927
That's really old.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.297
RICK:
How old?

35:31.330 --> 35:34.833
GARY: This is the type of thing
I'd expect to find in Europe.

35:34.866 --> 35:37.469
When I first saw it, I thought
that looks, like, medieval.

35:37.503 --> 35:39.605
A medieval cross.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.241
I mean, you know.
I mean, this is old.

35:42.274 --> 35:44.276
-This is really old.
-I-I don't, Gary.

35:44.310 --> 35:45.911
I hear it in your voice,
but I don't.

35:45.944 --> 35:48.247
How old?

35:48.280 --> 35:52.584
I would say that is somewhere
between 1200 and 1600.

35:59.958 --> 36:02.928
-RICK: Holy...
-GARY: Holy schmoly, all right.

36:02.961 --> 36:05.797
NARRATOR: While metal detecting
in Smith's Cove,

36:05.831 --> 36:07.966
Rick Lagina and Gary Drayton

36:07.999 --> 36:11.437
have just made
an astonishing discovery,

36:11.470 --> 36:15.674
a small metal object that
appears to be a medieval cross

36:15.707 --> 36:18.244
and which Gary believes
could date back

36:18.277 --> 36:21.313
as far as the 13th century.

36:21.347 --> 36:24.783
But, if so,
how did it get to Oak Island?

36:26.385 --> 36:27.919
RICK:
It's really that old?

36:27.953 --> 36:29.488
Yeah, that is old.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.423
That is really old.

36:31.457 --> 36:33.292
What makes you say that?
'Cause I...

36:33.325 --> 36:35.394
-Just-just the crudeness of it.
-I mean, I...

36:35.427 --> 36:40.332
And the style. I mean, you don't
normally see this kind of style.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.735
I've seen that shape before.

36:43.769 --> 36:45.671
I swear, that'll tell the tale
how old it is.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.373
-That shape.
-Yeah.

36:47.406 --> 36:49.575
Where do you think
you've seen it before?

36:49.608 --> 36:51.843
You know, when I was in France,

36:51.877 --> 36:54.580
I saw a carving like that

36:54.613 --> 36:57.316
in the Templar prison in Domme.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.586
NARRATOR:
A lead cross

37:00.619 --> 37:03.722
matching carvings made by
members of the Knights Templar?

37:03.755 --> 37:05.824
Just one week ago,

37:05.857 --> 37:08.260
while searching for evidence
that might connect

37:08.294 --> 37:11.263
various carvings found on
and around Oak Island

37:11.297 --> 37:14.032
to similar ones made by members
of the Knights Templar

37:14.065 --> 37:16.835
while they awaited execution
at Domme Prison,

37:16.868 --> 37:18.970
Rick Lagina was shown a wall

37:19.004 --> 37:21.407
on which was carved
an early depiction

37:21.440 --> 37:24.510
of the Hebrew Bible's
so-called Tree of Life.

37:24.543 --> 37:26.778
But just to the left
of the carving

37:26.812 --> 37:30.282
was a Templar-era depiction
of a Christian cross,

37:30.316 --> 37:32.851
one that bears
an eerie similarity

37:32.884 --> 37:36.855
to the object just unearthed
at Smith's Cove.

37:36.888 --> 37:40.892
Could Rick and Gary have just
found the first hard evidence

37:40.926 --> 37:44.496
connecting the Knights Templar
to the Oak Island mystery?

37:45.697 --> 37:47.633
Let's see what it registers at.

37:50.536 --> 37:52.904
Yeah, rock solid. No, there...

37:52.938 --> 37:54.740
Yeah, it's lead.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.775
Wow.

37:56.808 --> 38:00.346
That is a religious artifact.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.881
You've got to have an expert
look at this.

38:02.914 --> 38:06.518
And I'm sure
someone would probably know,

38:06.552 --> 38:08.387
just by the style,

38:08.420 --> 38:10.556
you know, where it comes from,

38:10.589 --> 38:13.825
who made it, the date range.

38:13.859 --> 38:16.995
That is unbelievable.

38:17.028 --> 38:18.597
RICK:
It's beautiful.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.966
-Mm-hmm.

38:20.999 --> 38:23.902
I mean, we might have just made
history here, Rick.

38:26.438 --> 38:28.940
Well, Gary,
let-let's call my brother.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.709
Let me... let me see
if I can't get him.

38:33.745 --> 38:36.648
Hey. Yeah.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.517
Here's your present for the day.

38:38.550 --> 38:41.387
It's not Bravo Tango,
but it's...

38:41.420 --> 38:43.121
quite remarkable.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.724
It's definitely worth
a bottle of red wine.

38:50.629 --> 38:52.130
You see the shape?

38:52.163 --> 38:54.366
I saw that in Domme.

38:55.701 --> 38:57.168
Yes.

39:01.039 --> 39:02.741
Smith's Cove.

39:02.774 --> 39:06.144
RICK:
But Gary thinks 1200 to 1600.

39:06.177 --> 39:08.013
Not 1600s.

39:08.046 --> 39:11.950
1200 to 1600.

39:11.983 --> 39:15.521
MARTY: It's one of the strange
things about Oak Island.

39:15.554 --> 39:18.924
-In this particular case,
you go to France... -Mm.

39:18.957 --> 39:21.827
...and you look at all kinds of
different carvings on the wall.

39:21.860 --> 39:27.599
And then a cross comes out
of the earth on Oak Island

39:27.633 --> 39:29.635
and you look at it and you say,

39:29.668 --> 39:31.737
-"I've seen that...
-"I've seen that."

39:31.770 --> 39:33.905
"...just recently.

39:33.939 --> 39:35.841
"In France.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.676
In a Templar prison."

39:37.709 --> 39:39.110
What are the odds of that?

39:43.449 --> 39:45.717
GARY: Yeah, I mean,
this-this is a really cool

39:45.751 --> 39:47.586
religious artifact.

39:52.958 --> 39:54.460
RICK:
Yep.

39:55.794 --> 39:57.563
-Thank you.
-Okay. See ya.

39:57.596 --> 39:59.631
Thanks.

39:59.665 --> 40:02.501
If that cross turns out to be
between 1200 and 1600,

40:02.534 --> 40:05.804
I'll become more convinced that,
no, something did happen here,

40:05.837 --> 40:08.774
something significant
pre-Money Pit discovery.

40:08.807 --> 40:10.576
So it's a big deal for me.

40:10.609 --> 40:11.877
Look, it's very curious.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.479
It's singularly out of place--

40:13.512 --> 40:14.813
there's no question about that.

40:14.846 --> 40:17.215
It's all the more reason
to follow

40:17.248 --> 40:19.217
wherever the search leads,

40:19.250 --> 40:22.888
wherever the information trail
leads regarding that-that cross.

40:22.921 --> 40:25.957
Everybody but everybody
came here looking for treasure.

40:25.991 --> 40:28.126
You come and you find something

40:28.159 --> 40:31.597
possibly even predating
original depositors.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.732
That makes it
all the more imperative

40:33.765 --> 40:36.735
that we try to figure out
what that is.

40:36.768 --> 40:39.137
I think it makes it
almost a foregone conclusion

40:39.170 --> 40:40.906
-we have to get back out there.
-Yeah.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.040
That's what I think.

40:42.073 --> 40:43.642
Quite a day.

40:43.675 --> 40:45.143
That was fantastic.

40:45.176 --> 40:48.079
That was...
remarkable.

40:48.113 --> 40:51.983
NARRATOR: For Rick, Marty,
and the Oak Island team,

40:52.017 --> 40:56.855
the discovery of what could be
a 13th-century Templar cross

40:56.888 --> 41:00.726
may turn out to be
not only a clue,

41:00.759 --> 41:04.963
but the first step
in finding an answer,

41:04.996 --> 41:06.965
perhaps the very answer

41:06.998 --> 41:08.867
that has eluded
treasure hunters

41:08.900 --> 41:11.269
for more than two centuries.

41:11.302 --> 41:14.039
For if proof can be established

41:14.072 --> 41:16.074
that members
of the Knights Templar

41:16.107 --> 41:18.610
successfully made their way
to North America

41:18.644 --> 41:21.112
as many as seven centuries ago,

41:21.146 --> 41:23.849
it would change
not only the history

41:23.882 --> 41:27.052
of a small island
off the coast of Nova Scotia--

41:27.085 --> 41:31.022
it could change the history
of the world forever.

41:35.727 --> 41:38.129
Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:38.163 --> 41:40.732
-JACK: We got lucky.
-GARY: A bone.

41:40.766 --> 41:42.133
RICK:
We're thinking a skeleton

41:42.167 --> 41:43.702
will come out of there.
Literally.

41:43.735 --> 41:44.970
Ooh!

41:45.003 --> 41:46.572
-Ah.
-It's lead.

41:46.605 --> 41:48.239
Laird, we've got something
to show you.

41:48.273 --> 41:50.008
We think it's gonna knock
your socks off.

41:50.041 --> 41:53.144
I... haven't seen anything
like that before.

41:53.178 --> 41:54.646
DANNY:
What this is doing now--

41:54.680 --> 41:55.881
unbelievable.

41:55.914 --> 41:58.850
We're down
into open cavern void.

41:58.884 --> 42:00.619
MARTY: It means we're in
the collapse of the Money Pit,

42:00.652 --> 42:02.120
and we're gonna find
what was ever in there.
