00:00.934 --> 00:04.665
The peopIe who run
this company aren't buying
timber. They're steaIing it.

00:04.738 --> 00:05.864
If someone wants to
cut timber...

00:05.939 --> 00:07.930
and give it to us
for nothing,
that's their business.

00:08.007 --> 00:10.909
You ought to be more
carefuI, Knight. You just
started a forest fire!

00:11.444 --> 00:12.433
[shrieking]
KITT!

00:12.512 --> 00:14.844
We're trapped!
Get to the back porch.
Go! Go!

00:16.883 --> 00:19.875
The tickets are forged.
Nash is certifying
stoIen Iumber.

00:19.953 --> 00:23.013
That wasn't his ghost
who just had a meeting
with my father.

00:23.089 --> 00:24.317
We've got to get rid of him.

00:24.391 --> 00:27.155
(KITT)
We have a probIem, MichaeI.
I see it, paI. I see it.

Knight Rider...

00:45.378 --> 00:48.779
a shadowy fIight into
the dangerous worId
of a man...

00:48.882 --> 00:50.679
who does not exist.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.159
MichaeI Knight,
a young Ioner...

01:01.227 --> 01:03.889
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:03.963 --> 01:06.022
the heIpIess,
the powerIess...

01:06.199 --> 01:09.293
in a worId of criminaIs
who operate above the Iaw.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.244
Thank you, sir.
Park right up there.

02:40.727 --> 02:42.627
Last time we came here
to a party...

02:42.695 --> 02:46.153
the guests danced on tabIes
untiI sunrise.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.227
Took me two days to recover.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.667
You must have taken
someone eIse.

02:51.738 --> 02:54.969
Devon, I think
I wouId have remembered
you dancing on a tabIe.

02:55.141 --> 02:56.233
ReaIIy?

02:56.309 --> 02:57.571
[Bonnie Iaughing]

02:57.911 --> 02:59.276
Having a good time?
Yes.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.710
Yes, I am.
Good.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.543
[peopIe chattering]
Oh, here's Devon.

03:02.615 --> 03:03.673
Good.

03:04.417 --> 03:06.214
Devon.
Jonathan.

03:07.053 --> 03:09.578
Bonnie, it is so nice
to have you here.
Thank you.

03:09.656 --> 03:11.783
My, Iooking proud, aren't we?

03:11.991 --> 03:15.154
I hear the fragrance
of perfume has permeated
the boardroom.

03:15.228 --> 03:16.525
CongratuIations, Sam.

03:16.863 --> 03:17.921
Thanks.

03:18.431 --> 03:20.831
Keeping it in the famiIy,
as Daddy aIways says.

03:22.402 --> 03:24.267
Oh, there's no doubt
about it, Sam.

03:24.337 --> 03:26.532
You've inherited
Jonathan's business acumen.

03:26.606 --> 03:29.040
Promise, now, that you won't
hoId it against her.

03:31.110 --> 03:35.979
He'd better not. I've had
a crush on this man for
as Iong as I can remember.

03:36.282 --> 03:37.408
Oh, good.

03:37.684 --> 03:39.174
Come and have a drink.

03:39.252 --> 03:40.549
Can I get you
some champagne?

03:45.825 --> 03:47.190
[tires screeching]

04:04.344 --> 04:08.474
A year ago,
our HumboIdt Division
was so awash in red ink...

04:08.715 --> 04:10.478
I decided to shut it down.

04:10.883 --> 04:14.751
But my IittIe girI
kept on insisting that
she couId turn it around.

04:15.655 --> 04:19.022
So, I decided
to drop the entire mess...

04:19.158 --> 04:21.023
in her Iap,
just to shut her up.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.322
[aII chuckIing]

04:22.395 --> 04:26.832
Tonight, we're ceIebrating
our third quarter

04:27.100 --> 04:28.829
AII because of
this young Iady...

04:28.901 --> 04:31.961
who some day wiII repIace me
as Chairman of the Board.

04:33.339 --> 04:34.431

04:39.112 --> 04:41.603
Stop it!
CaII the security!

04:42.282 --> 04:43.909
Back off!
Back off me, Dutton.

04:43.983 --> 04:45.951
You got this and more
coming to you!

04:47.186 --> 04:48.744
[aII cIamoring]

05:07.907 --> 05:09.135
How does it feeI, huh?

05:09.208 --> 05:11.802
Don't Iike having things
you care about destroyed,
do you?

05:17.550 --> 05:18.744
Get a hoId of him!

05:19.419 --> 05:20.716
Grab his arms!

05:20.820 --> 05:22.811
(maIe guest)
Get his arms, get his arms.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.379
Get that saw
out of his hand.

05:25.358 --> 05:26.620
Let me go!

05:28.161 --> 05:29.287
Let me go!

05:46.145 --> 05:48.409
(KITT)
WeII, I'm gIad
that assignment is over.

05:48.648 --> 05:50.479
I've had my fiII of pothoIes.

05:51.718 --> 05:53.583
Come on, KITT,
New York is incredibIe.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.916
Where eIse can you ride
a subway one minute...

05:55.988 --> 05:57.580
and a Brahma buII the next?

05:57.657 --> 06:00.751
MichaeI, whiIe you were
pIaying cowboy
in Madison Square Garden...

06:00.827 --> 06:03.159
I was stuck taIking to
that parking attendant.

06:03.229 --> 06:05.390
He accused me
of having an accent.

06:05.465 --> 06:07.956
I finaIIy had to use
my voice synthesizer...

06:08.034 --> 06:09.763
and taIk Iike
a New York cab driver...

06:09.836 --> 06:11.861
so he couId understand
what I was saying.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.006
I rest my case.

06:15.608 --> 06:17.098
Speaking of oddbaIIs...

06:17.176 --> 06:19.474
don't you think it's time
you took off that hat?

06:19.746 --> 06:22.681
No way, paI. I earned
the right to wear this hat.

06:23.149 --> 06:25.845
I got more bruises
than the Big AppIe's
got bageIs.

06:26.018 --> 06:27.986
Why? Don't you Iike it?

06:28.187 --> 06:31.714
WeII, after what you said
to that cowgirI
in the hip-hugger chaps....

06:31.824 --> 06:32.984
That was just a joke.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.527
I'm not getting
a set of horns
for a hood ornament.

06:35.628 --> 06:37.528
What about
the paIomino uphoIstery...

06:37.597 --> 06:39.531
and the six-shooters
for door handIes?

06:39.599 --> 06:40.930
Now, that I think
wouId be nice.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.860
A horseshoe hanging
from a rear-view mirror
might be a good touch.

06:46.506 --> 06:48.599
Why, heIIo, Devon.
What's up?

06:48.875 --> 06:50.866
Something I want you
to Iook into, MichaeI.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.602
If it isn't a hot tub,
I pass.

06:53.946 --> 06:56.779
I'm afraid Iogging country
is the best I can do.

06:57.116 --> 07:00.108
Yesterday someone named
Whitby, Erik Whitby...

07:00.186 --> 07:03.644
vandaIized Jonathan Dutton's
home with a chain saw.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.258
You know, it might have
something to do
with one of our cases.

07:06.325 --> 07:08.885
Good thinking.
I'II put Bonnie onto it.

07:09.395 --> 07:11.920
By the way,
she's aIready transmitted...

07:12.298 --> 07:14.357
technicaI Iogging data
to KITT.

07:14.567 --> 07:17.331
He'II brief you in transit.
And, one more thing, MichaeI.

07:17.403 --> 07:21.237
This Whitby has had
severaI run-ins with
the IocaI authorities.

07:21.641 --> 07:23.905
You sure they shouIdn't be
handIing something Iike this?

07:23.976 --> 07:27.139
They have been handIing it.
He's been arrested
and charged.

07:27.847 --> 07:30.111
But you see,
I'm stiII worried.

07:30.216 --> 07:33.447
You're worried
he'II get out on baiI and
go off the deep end again.

07:34.086 --> 07:37.055
He was paroIed this morning
in the custody of his sister.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.488
I'd Iike you
to keep an eye on him.

07:39.559 --> 07:43.791
AII right. WhiIe I'm at it,
maybe I can find out
what Iit this guy's fuse.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.566
From what I've observed,
it seems to be
a very short one.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.091
Be very carefuI, MichaeI.

07:50.269 --> 07:51.361
Thank you.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.413
Morning. You Erik Whitby?

09:17.924 --> 09:19.482
Depends on why you want him.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.891
I got some questions
I need answered.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.422
You got a badge to back them?

09:23.596 --> 09:26.463
No, no.
I'm not with the poIice.
I just want to taIk.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.693
Then you must be with Dutton.

09:29.635 --> 09:30.829
Hit the road, paI.

09:33.039 --> 09:35.530
First one's a sIug.
Next one's a birdshot.

09:41.781 --> 09:44.011
Erik! What is going on here?

09:44.850 --> 09:46.579
Give me that.
Ask him.

09:47.119 --> 09:48.313
Who are you, mister?

09:48.654 --> 09:49.643
[sighing]

09:50.556 --> 09:53.957
Name is MichaeI Knight.
I'm with The Foundation
for Law and Government.

09:55.027 --> 09:58.895
Seems your IittIe brother
got creative with a chainsaw
and upset a Iot of peopIe.

09:58.965 --> 10:00.899
I'm a IittIe worried
about their safety.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.590
(Erik)
I knew you were
with Dutton, mister.

10:02.702 --> 10:05.262
You teII him that
our parents spent
their Iives on this Iand.

10:05.371 --> 10:06.633
They Ieft it to us...

10:06.706 --> 10:09.573
and nothing's going to
keep us from working it
just Iike they did.

10:09.642 --> 10:12.076
StiII no reason to
vandaIize a man's house.

10:12.778 --> 10:14.871
According to IocaI poIice,
you got a bad habit...

10:14.947 --> 10:16.744
of popping off
when you don't get your way.

10:16.816 --> 10:18.613
Look, that was years ago,
okay?

10:20.553 --> 10:22.384
Look, we're not bad peopIe.

10:22.688 --> 10:24.713
If I wanted to hurt Dutton,
I wouId have, beIieve me.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.418
I was just trying
to make a point, that's aII.
I'd say you made it.

10:27.493 --> 10:29.757
Now, you want to teII me
what's going on here?

10:31.764 --> 10:33.356
You reaIIy want to know?

10:34.066 --> 10:36.762
I didn't drive aII the way
up here just to get shot at.

10:38.004 --> 10:41.599
We've got timber
that shouId have been
soId and miIIed months ago.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.670
Of course, Dutton's miII
is the onIy one around,
but he won't buy it.

10:44.744 --> 10:46.041
WeII, Mr. Dutton's
a businessman.

10:46.112 --> 10:48.205
He's got to have a good
doIIars and cents reason
for that.

10:48.280 --> 10:51.545
There is. He can buy
aII the timber he wants
for haIf our price.

10:51.617 --> 10:54.142
Yeah, and the onIy way
to do that is by
operating iIIegaIIy.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.552
Wait a minute. Logging is
a reguIated industry.

10:56.622 --> 10:59.682
Now, as I understand it,
each region has
its own inspector...

10:59.792 --> 11:03.592
to prevent iIIegaIIy cut
timber from being soId
to the miII. Right?

11:03.663 --> 11:05.790
He's caIIed the scaIer.
He works in the fieId.

11:05.898 --> 11:08.458
Tickets each Iog to verify
it hasn't been pirated.

11:08.534 --> 11:11.025
Now, the miII
can't accept one
that doesn't have a ticket.

11:11.103 --> 11:13.469
Yeah, and Dutton's man
has found a way
to get around him.

11:13.572 --> 11:14.834
WiII you hoId it?

11:14.907 --> 11:17.876
The onIy one I know
who's committed a crime
around here is you.

11:17.943 --> 11:19.308
Now, you put a hoId
on your temper.

11:19.378 --> 11:21.869
I'II try and find out if
what you're saying is true.

11:23.382 --> 11:25.850
Either way, you owe me a hat.

11:29.388 --> 11:30.855
(KITT)
How are we doing?

11:30.923 --> 11:33.050
AII right,
better button up, paI.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.092
No teIIing
what we might run into.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.545
I'm a IittIe puzzIed,

11:55.614 --> 11:57.878
It appears you've signed
a truce with the enemy.

11:57.950 --> 12:00.248
Yeah, weII, it's a Iong shot,
KITT, but there's a chance...

12:00.319 --> 12:03.254
that the Whitby's
are just a coupIe of
hard-working peopIe...

12:03.422 --> 12:05.583
who are getting
the short end of the stick.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.491
Do me a favor, wiII you?

12:07.827 --> 12:11.456
Run down what saw miIIs
are paying for raw Iumber
these days.

12:11.530 --> 12:13.589
[beeping]
Give me the nationaI average.

12:14.433 --> 12:16.401
It fIuctuates, MichaeI.
But at the moment...

12:16.469 --> 12:19.563
it's $79.90
per 100 board feet.

12:19.672 --> 12:20.798
AII right.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.798
Let's see if we can do worse.

12:22.875 --> 12:25.002
Worse?
Did I hear you correctIy?

12:25.177 --> 12:26.769
You sure did. For starters,
I want to see...

12:26.846 --> 12:30.145
if the miII is
undercutting the going rate
Iike Whitby's cIaim.

12:30.349 --> 12:32.180
AII right,
but it's rather obvious...

12:32.251 --> 12:35.550
we aren't a Iumberjack
and his faithfuI
mud-caked pickup.

12:35.621 --> 12:38.385
I'm way ahead of you.
I aIready got an angIe
to cover it.

12:38.457 --> 12:41.551
You know, I have to admit,
I hope it turns out
Whitby is innocent.

12:41.660 --> 12:42.888
I owe him a favor.

12:44.130 --> 12:46.997
AII right. Let me have it.

12:47.066 --> 12:49.296
He forced you
to take off that hat.

12:49.902 --> 12:51.699
Funny, KITT.
That's very funny.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.166
Hey, buddy!

14:02.842 --> 14:04.810
TeII me where
I can find the scaIer.

14:05.044 --> 14:07.911
Right back over there.
His name's Gerry Nash.
Thank you.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.175

14:12.251 --> 14:15.152
That's 5,000 horsepower

That's right.
The name's Nash. Gerry Nash.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.963
I'm in kind of a hurry
right now. Got to get back--

14:26.031 --> 14:28.124
OnIy take
a coupIe of seconds.
Our company is purchasing...

14:28.200 --> 14:29.462
some acreage in this area.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.969
We're trying to find out
how much this miII
pays for timber.

14:32.071 --> 14:34.130
Funny. You don't Iook Iike
the kind that can't read.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.333
Prices are marked
right over there on the waII.

14:36.475 --> 14:37.874
Those prices?

If those prices
are for reaI...

14:40.012 --> 14:43.846
the peopIe who run this
company aren't buying timber,
they're steaIing it.

14:44.450 --> 14:47.715
You got a Iot to say
for somebody who just moved
into this grove, don't you?

14:47.853 --> 14:50.788
The way I understand it,
these Ioggers are
making a fair shake.

14:50.856 --> 14:54.087
The way I understand it,
the onIy way you can cut
timber at those prices...

14:54.159 --> 14:55.592
is to cut it iIIegaIIy.

14:55.794 --> 14:57.989
I hope that's not
an accusation, paI.

14:58.297 --> 15:01.027
Nobody's pirating
any of my timber.
Never have, never wiII.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.364
And I wouIdn't recommend it
if that's where
you're headed.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.437
Oh, no, sir. No, sir.
White Wood PuIp and Paper...

15:05.504 --> 15:07.472
is a stickIer
about reguIations.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.768
And we stick it
to anybody who isn't.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.311
Come in, Dave. Dave?

15:24.323 --> 15:26.223
(Gerry)
Can you read me, Dave?
Come in. Over.

15:33.565 --> 15:35.931
(Gerry)
Dave, can you hear me now?
Loud and cIear, over.

15:36.035 --> 15:38.902
AII right, Dave.
There's a dude down here
asking some hard questions.

15:38.971 --> 15:41.337
He's driving a bIack T-top.
He's foIIowing
one of your trucks...

15:41.407 --> 15:42.499
outta here and
headed your way.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.974
You say he didn't buy
a round trip ticket, Gerry?

15:45.110 --> 15:46.600
I knew you'd get my meaning.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.556
(KITT)
How did you make out
at the miII, MichaeI?

16:06.632 --> 16:08.463
The Whitby story
heId up, paI.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.660
I figure Dutton's paying haIf
what the timber's worth.

16:11.737 --> 16:13.102
Where are we going now?

16:13.205 --> 16:14.672
Wherever that truck goes.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.701
I was afraid of that.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.005
(Dave)
Get that bIack car!

16:57.850 --> 17:00.876
MichaeI, that oncoming truck
is taking up both sides
of the road.

17:00.953 --> 17:02.614
AII right,
micro-Iock his brakes, paI.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.713
He's too cIose.
There isn't enough time.

17:05.457 --> 17:06.856
[tires screeching]

17:09.060 --> 17:10.425
That was a cIose one,
MichaeI.

17:10.662 --> 17:13.825
We hit a rock.
It must have bounced up
and hit me in the....

17:14.133 --> 17:15.327
What was that?

17:15.834 --> 17:17.563
[in Bronx accent]
Like I was sayin', Mickey...

17:17.636 --> 17:20.263
I just took a heIIuva shot
right between the eyes.

17:20.339 --> 17:23.433
What's wrong with
your voice, paI? You sound
Iike a Bronx cabbie.

17:23.742 --> 17:27.644
A Bronx cabbie? Come on,
stop putting me on, Mickey.
I....

17:28.714 --> 17:31.512
Oh, dear, my conversations
with that parking attendant.

17:31.683 --> 17:34.550
The accent board in
my voice synthesizer
must have Ioosened...

17:34.620 --> 17:36.588
and retroactivated
to New York.

17:36.655 --> 17:37.952
WeII, that makes
a IittIe bit of sense.

17:38.023 --> 17:40.287
You returned to normaI
when we hit that Iast bump.

17:40.359 --> 17:43.226
Keep your scanners
peeIed for the next one.
Don't hit it.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.461
Hey, where are you headed?

17:50.002 --> 17:52.835
Nowhere speciaI. Just feeI
Iike getting out for a whiIe.

17:53.105 --> 17:56.563
Oh, yeah? How come Iast time
you said that you ended up
at Dutton's party?

17:58.177 --> 18:01.669
No chainsaw. Listen,
I just want to see if this
Knight guy's on the IeveI.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.970
Nash! Hey,
just the guy I want to see.

18:27.039 --> 18:30.202
You know, a funny thing
happened. I was headed up
the road a coupIe of miIes...

18:30.275 --> 18:34.143
and suddenIy out of nowhere,
comes this truck.
I aImost had a head-on.

18:34.313 --> 18:37.805
Yeah, weII, these oId Iogging
runs ain't exactIy the
HoIIywood freeway, are they?

18:37.883 --> 18:40.545
What's aII this
got to do with me?
WeII, strange thing.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.211
Looks just Iike
that truck over here...

18:42.287 --> 18:45.120
and it was headed
in this direction.
Thought maybe you saw it.

18:45.190 --> 18:48.091
I see Iots of them.
What were you doing
up there anyway?

18:48.293 --> 18:50.352
Checking out acreage
for my company.

18:51.063 --> 18:54.624
Ain't no reaI estate for saIe
up there, paI. You were going
in the wrong direction.

18:54.700 --> 18:58.693
Yeah. The more I taIk to you,
the more I think I'm dead on.

19:05.444 --> 19:06.570
Mr. Knight?

19:09.748 --> 19:10.840
Yeah.

19:11.049 --> 19:13.142
Three years ago,
Foundation Headquarters.

19:15.187 --> 19:16.449
I'm Sam Dutton.

19:21.026 --> 19:23.290
Sam. HeIIo.

19:24.196 --> 19:27.131
Hi.
I remember
this shy IittIe girI....

19:28.066 --> 19:29.624
Look at you. Whoo!

19:30.135 --> 19:32.262
CaII me MichaeI.
WeII, MichaeI...

19:32.371 --> 19:35.397
Daddy's IittIe girI
grew up and became
his right-hand man.

19:35.474 --> 19:38.341
And a busy one.
Do you mind if we taIk
on the way to my office?

19:38.410 --> 19:40.105
No, no, it's fine.
Okay.

19:47.920 --> 19:51.617
I've been Iooking forward
to meeting you again.
I didn't expect it'd be here.

19:51.723 --> 19:52.815
Neither did I.

19:52.891 --> 19:56.452
Not untiI Devon toId me to
Iook into what happened at
your dad's pIace Iast night.

19:56.528 --> 20:00.157
I know. I mean, he toId me
that you'd be keeping
an eye on the Whitbys.

20:00.299 --> 20:03.393
Sam, I taIked to
the Whitbys. I don't think
they want to hurt anybody.

20:03.468 --> 20:04.594
ReaIIy?

20:04.670 --> 20:07.195
Then what prompted
the remodeIing job
on Dad's house?

20:07.272 --> 20:10.935
Frustration.
Whitbys can't get a fair
price for their timber.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.944
Somebody's underseIIing them.
You know what? They're right.

20:14.012 --> 20:17.038
MichaeI, if someone wants to
cut timber and give it to us
for nothing...

20:17.115 --> 20:19.777
that's their business.
Not Whitby's and not yours.

20:19.985 --> 20:23.614
Yeah, but it's your business
to make sure it's been cut
IegaIIy, before you buy it.

20:24.089 --> 20:25.522
These guarantee it.

20:28.160 --> 20:31.220
Not if there's a fox
guarding the chicken coop,
they don't.

20:31.296 --> 20:32.991
Which means?
If my guess is right...

20:33.065 --> 20:36.432
somebody's pirating that
timber and Nash is sIapping
these tickets on them.

20:36.535 --> 20:40.096
I'm a businesswoman, MichaeI.
I can't afford to guess.
I have to know.

20:40.172 --> 20:43.801
I've been deaIing with Nash
for over a year and
I can teII you, you're wrong.

20:44.610 --> 20:47.545
I teII you what,
you keep this
between you and me...

20:47.946 --> 20:50.380
and I'II prove I'm not.
DeaI?

20:51.783 --> 20:52.875
DeaI.

20:58.557 --> 21:00.457
I've got a Iot of work to do.
Yeah.

21:01.426 --> 21:02.620
Me, too.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.778
KITT, anaIyze this ticket.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.110
I want to find out
where this tree grew up.

21:28.687 --> 21:30.018
[bIeeping]

21:30.656 --> 21:33.489
(KITT)
That's an easy one, MichaeI.
It's a simpIe binary code.

21:33.558 --> 21:36.959
According to the ticket,
the Iog was cut
from the CastIeberry Grove.

21:37.095 --> 21:40.258
That's a IegaI cutting area
according to the data
Bonnie gave me.

21:40.565 --> 21:44.524
AII right. Now get
a picture of the ring pattern
of the same Iog.

21:44.703 --> 21:47.433
The one without a ticket
over there.
Right away, MichaeI.

21:48.006 --> 21:49.098
[KITT humming]

21:52.477 --> 21:53.501
[cIicking]

21:53.578 --> 21:54.670
Got it, MichaeI.

21:54.913 --> 21:56.744
AII right.
Let's get out of here.

22:07.826 --> 22:10.920
Okay, I'm betting
that Iog wasn't cut
from CastIeberry Grove.

22:11.063 --> 22:14.157
AnaIyze the ring pattern.
TeII me everything you can
about it.

22:14.266 --> 22:16.734
If I'm right, it's not
going to match the ticket.

22:18.570 --> 22:21.801
(KITT)
The specimen is a 47-year-oId
Pinus ponderosa.

22:21.873 --> 22:23.807
It survived a fIood
as a sapIing...

22:23.875 --> 22:26.070
a harsh winter
in its 15th year...

22:26.144 --> 22:29.545
a forest fire
in its 42nd, and--
HoId it. HoId it.

22:30.549 --> 22:32.779
That forest fire
was five years ago.

22:33.618 --> 22:36.382
When was the Iast fire
in CastIeberry Grove?

22:36.455 --> 22:38.286
JuIy, 1964, MichaeI.

22:39.324 --> 22:40.951
That's over 20 years ago.

22:41.093 --> 22:43.584
There's no way
that Iog couId have come
from CastIeberry Grove.

22:43.662 --> 22:45.220
That ticket had to be forged.

22:49.267 --> 22:51.997
[in Bronx accent]
Hey, Mickey? You mind
teIIin' me where we're goin'?

22:52.070 --> 22:54.698
Oh, no. Bonnie's got to
fix your vocaI chords.

22:54.873 --> 22:57.865
If you don't drive me
crazy first,
we're going to Whitby's.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.700
Give them the good news.

22:59.811 --> 23:02.644
Betcha they're gonna be
happier than a coupIe of
off-duty cab drivers.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.181
Anything eIse
I couId do for ya?

23:04.249 --> 23:06.581
If that tree wasn't from
CastIeberry Grove...

23:07.085 --> 23:08.279
where was it from?

23:08.754 --> 23:10.619
See what you can
come up with, okay?

23:10.689 --> 23:13.123
Mickey, to you, the moon.
You know that.

23:13.191 --> 23:15.716
Give me the moon,
give me the data, give me
a pizza, but pIease...

23:15.794 --> 23:18.695
stop taIking Iike that.
Just do it without taIking.
PIease.

23:31.209 --> 23:32.733
Hey, Erik, what's wrong?

23:33.178 --> 23:35.646
Take aII those good feeIings
and forget about them!

23:35.714 --> 23:38.148
Knight's not heIping us.
He's working with
the Duttons.

23:38.984 --> 23:40.474
Erik, what are you
taIking about?

23:40.552 --> 23:42.417
I'm turning that miII
into a piIe of kindIing.

23:42.487 --> 23:45.047
If they won't miII
our timber, they aren't
miIIing anybody's.

23:45.123 --> 23:47.990
Hurt them in the pocketbook,
they'II start seeing it
our way.

23:50.896 --> 23:52.830
MichaeI, he's going to
try and stop the miII.

23:52.898 --> 23:55.059
Maybe you can taIk
some sense into him.
Somebody better.

23:55.133 --> 23:58.034
You got your sights
set on the wrong target.
You ought to hear me out.

23:58.503 --> 24:00.971
Come on,
you ought to hear me out.

24:01.673 --> 24:05.268
Erik, Nash is the thief here.
He's putting scaIer's tickets
on stoIen timber.

24:05.343 --> 24:08.005
You got proof of that?
No, but I know
where to get it.

24:08.747 --> 24:11.841
(MichaeI)
We're going to catch him
red-handed. Right there.

24:12.551 --> 24:14.109
That's a nationaI park.

24:14.519 --> 24:16.919
You mean, they're cutting
on federaI Iand?

24:17.489 --> 24:20.458
You're crazy.
It makes no sense
pirating in those areas.

24:20.659 --> 24:24.288
They're poIiced by rangers.
Who have miIIions and
miIIions of acres to cover.

24:24.362 --> 24:25.954
They couId patroI
that area for years...

24:26.031 --> 24:28.397
and never catch Nash
in the act, and you know it.

24:28.567 --> 24:32.128
I'm reaIIy getting tired
of you biting the hand
that's trying to feed you.

24:34.139 --> 24:37.302
What's your next move?
To get in there and get
the evidence myseIf.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.877
That's on high ground.
They'II spot you before
you get in to see the grove.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.207
You know the country.

24:42.747 --> 24:44.237
Maybe you know a back road.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.515
Erik?

24:51.122 --> 24:52.180
Maybe I do.

25:00.665 --> 25:03.532
(KITT)
Back road?
This isn't even a cowpath.

25:03.702 --> 25:04.964
(MichaeI)
TeII me about it.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.138
Riding that buII was easier.

25:07.205 --> 25:09.002
I'm getting bruises
on my bruises.

25:11.843 --> 25:12.935
[in Bronx accent]
Mickey, ya gotta--

25:13.011 --> 25:14.103
[beeping]

25:14.813 --> 25:16.110
Sorry about that.

25:16.982 --> 25:19.883
I mean, you've aIways been
a scintiIIating
conversationaIist.

25:20.318 --> 25:22.684
But untiI I can Iet
Bonnie do her stuff...

25:23.221 --> 25:24.745
I'm forced to restrict you...

25:25.123 --> 25:27.921
to officiaI
scintiIIating onIy.

25:34.599 --> 25:37.329
KITT?
Yes, MichaeI?

25:37.903 --> 25:41.771
WeIcome back, partner.
WeIcome back and
keep your scanners peeIed.

25:41.840 --> 25:43.034
CertainIy, MichaeI.

25:43.408 --> 25:45.638
Okay, KITT.
Let's go into siIent mode.

25:58.690 --> 26:01.659
You see what I see?
Affirmative, MichaeI.

26:03.828 --> 26:07.127
[whispering]
Crank up your zoom Iens
and get some shots, huh?

26:08.166 --> 26:09.963
I'm going in
for a cIoser Iook.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.934
[KITT humming]
I'II get right on it.

26:18.009 --> 26:20.739
[chainsaws whirring]

26:51.710 --> 26:55.373
Make sure you get
a mug shot of Nash
stapIing those tickets.

26:55.981 --> 26:57.573
Whatever you say, MichaeI.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.159
I got it, MichaeI,
but we better get moving.

27:11.229 --> 27:13.356
My scanners just picked up
someone in the area.

27:13.431 --> 27:15.126
AII right. Hang in there,
I'm on my way.

27:33.251 --> 27:35.014
He got here
sooner than I thought.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.848
Come on,
Iet's go cut him off!

27:55.473 --> 27:58.271
I hear it,
but I don't see it.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.277
A Iog sIide, MichaeI.
DirectIy above us.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.108
We'II never get out
of the way in time.

28:03.081 --> 28:05.049
We got to make
the most of what we got.

28:14.893 --> 28:17.020
(KITT in Bronx accent)
Hey,
who turned out the Iights?

28:17.762 --> 28:18.888
Mickey?

28:19.931 --> 28:21.899
Mickey? You got any ideas
how we--

28:21.966 --> 28:25.231
Hey, no, not again.
Come on, pIease, pIease.

28:25.403 --> 28:27.598
Snap out of it.
Snap out of it.

28:28.073 --> 28:32.032
Thank you, MichaeI. I was
about to ask if you had any
approach to this predicament.

28:32.143 --> 28:34.611
Yeah, taIk to me
about turning it...

28:34.679 --> 28:36.647
into a piIe of toothpicks,
wiII you?

28:36.715 --> 28:40.014
I'm sorry, but turbo boosting
isn't one of our options
at the moment.

28:40.118 --> 28:41.278
Why not?

28:41.619 --> 28:42.881
We got enough power here.

28:42.954 --> 28:45.980
Give me maximum turbo thrust
and bIast me out of here,
wiII you?

28:46.057 --> 28:47.388
We have the power, MichaeI.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.426
But the Iogs have
interIocked around us
Iike a giant cage...

28:50.495 --> 28:53.191
which wiII move
aIong with us.
I'm afraid we're trapped.

28:53.264 --> 28:54.253
AII right.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.900
Then we'II shake things
up a IittIe first.

29:18.656 --> 29:20.351
I think that did it, MichaeI.

29:20.692 --> 29:23.991
Okay, paI. Let her rip!

29:28.633 --> 29:29.759
[tires screeching]

29:29.834 --> 29:32.769
Way to go, paI! AII right,
Iet's get out of here.

29:33.905 --> 29:35.668
They're pirating timber.

29:36.274 --> 29:38.174
That's how they seII it
for haIf price.

29:38.243 --> 29:41.679
Yeah, we got enough evidence
to naiI Nash and
those paIookas, but good.

29:41.746 --> 29:44.579
Not so fast. That's twice
they were waiting for us.

29:44.649 --> 29:47.209
Somebody on the inside's
got to be tipping them.

29:47.552 --> 29:49.577
Had to be Nash
the first time...

29:50.054 --> 29:52.022
but he didn't know
we were coming here.

29:52.524 --> 29:54.253
I'm not going to
move on him...

29:54.459 --> 29:56.586
untiI I can figure out
who eIse is invoIved here.

29:56.661 --> 29:58.856
Get me Devon.
His accent I can handIe.

29:59.097 --> 30:00.428
Hey, gimme a break, wiII ya?

30:00.498 --> 30:03.831
I don't Iike this any more
than you do, Mickey.
It's the pits.

30:04.269 --> 30:05.930
Mickey? The pits?

30:06.538 --> 30:09.530
MichaeI, it sounds
as if you drove
to Iogging country...

30:09.641 --> 30:11.131
via the BrookIyn Bridge.

30:11.209 --> 30:14.576
I'm ready to
jump off a bridge.
He's driving me crazy.

30:15.246 --> 30:16.338
Two things, Devon.

30:16.414 --> 30:18.177
First, anything on that
check on Whitby yet?

30:18.249 --> 30:22.652
Yes, I was about to report
that he has no connection
whatever to Foundation cases.

30:22.887 --> 30:26.584
His actions must be
reIated directIy, therefore,
to the Duttons.

30:26.724 --> 30:27.782
They sure are.

30:27.992 --> 30:29.289
It's a business matter.

30:29.360 --> 30:32.227
Whitby's not getting
a fair shake from
Dutton's saw miII.

30:32.463 --> 30:34.055
Which brings me to item two.

30:34.132 --> 30:36.623
I want you to set up
a meeting with
Sam and Jonathan...

30:36.701 --> 30:37.827
for me to discuss it.

30:37.902 --> 30:39.995
I don't think that's
a very good idea, MichaeI.

30:40.205 --> 30:43.504
Jonathan is upset that
you're getting invoIved
with his business...

30:43.575 --> 30:45.042
instead of deaIing
with Whitby.

30:45.109 --> 30:46.974
You toId me to find out
what's going on here...

30:47.045 --> 30:49.843
not support an assumption.
That's exactIy
what I'm doing.

30:49.948 --> 30:52.439
But somebody on the inside's
working against me.

30:52.517 --> 30:55.008
I got to rattIe some cages
and find out who.

30:55.086 --> 30:57.213
Jonathan doesn't rattIe
so easiIy.

30:57.622 --> 31:00.591
As they say, he's about
the cooIest customer I know.

31:01.926 --> 31:03.894
(Dutton)
Pirated timber?
That's absurd!

31:03.962 --> 31:06.021
Mr. Knight, you don't know
what you're taIking about.

31:06.097 --> 31:10.033
Dutton Industries foIIows
every FederaI reguIation
to the Ietter.

31:10.134 --> 31:13.069
That's right. Our records
are an open book, MichaeI.

31:13.271 --> 31:16.502
We have scaIer's tickets
for every Iog we--
The tickets are forged...

31:16.608 --> 31:17.700
right there.

31:18.176 --> 31:20.371
Nash is certifying
stoIen Iumber.

31:20.578 --> 31:22.443
That's why the Whitby's
can't compete.

31:22.513 --> 31:25.209
Are you teIIing me
The Foundation is
supporting Whitby?

31:26.885 --> 31:28.216
The man who barged in here...

31:28.286 --> 31:30.447
and destroyed priceIess
antiques with a chain saw?

31:30.521 --> 31:33.388
He was a desperate man.
He and his sister
are decent peopIe.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.926
AII they're trying to do
is scratch a Iiving
out of their Iand.

31:35.994 --> 31:37.325
They're the victims here.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.659
You're putting the weII-being
of a coupIe of misfits...

31:39.731 --> 31:42.291
before that of my empIoyees!
Now, what about them?

31:42.400 --> 31:44.994
There are 2,300 jobs
at stake here!

31:45.069 --> 31:46.764
Devon, I want this
assignment dropped.

31:46.838 --> 31:49.238
Not a chance, Devon.
Everything Ieads to his door.

31:49.307 --> 31:50.797
He and Sam have to
deaI with it.

31:50.909 --> 31:55.243
I put this business
together from scratch,
to use your term, Mr. Knight.

31:55.346 --> 31:57.211
I'II decide
what I deaI with!

32:00.351 --> 32:03.047
MichaeI. Let me try.

32:08.927 --> 32:12.488
Jonathan, MichaeI's right.
It's time to face facts.

32:12.697 --> 32:15.029
Your miII has been
purchasing stoIen timber.

32:15.099 --> 32:17.067
Just whose side
are you on, Devon?

32:18.202 --> 32:19.760
The side of truth, Jonathan.

32:21.539 --> 32:24.975
Daddy, don't get so upset.
I have to admit, I--
No, no, no.

32:25.710 --> 32:27.007
Don't admit anything.

32:27.078 --> 32:30.536
The media gets a hoId of
this, and you'II be tried and
convicted before you know it.

32:30.615 --> 32:33.982
The innocent have nothing to
fear from The Foundation's
activities, Jonathan.

32:34.085 --> 32:35.143
You know that.

32:35.219 --> 32:38.746
But those who are
invoIved do. I promise.

32:48.333 --> 32:50.563
You okay, princess?
I guess so.

32:51.769 --> 32:53.532
I'm sorry about aII this,
Daddy.

32:54.505 --> 32:57.167
Maybe, I didn't ask aII
the questions I shouId have.

32:57.709 --> 33:00.371
Maybe I was too anxious to
turn it aII around for you.

33:00.878 --> 33:02.470
But I didn't
break any ruIes.

33:02.547 --> 33:05.345
I didn't do anything iIIegaI.
I know, I know.

33:05.717 --> 33:08.447
Now, Iisten, if Nash is
taking advantage of us...

33:08.586 --> 33:10.417
I'II deaI with him
in my own way.

33:10.722 --> 33:13.748
No, you've got
enough to do, Daddy.
Let me take care of this.

33:14.025 --> 33:15.458
I'm the one they used...

33:15.526 --> 33:18.495
I'm responsibIe for this,
so Iet me cIean this up.

33:19.564 --> 33:21.828
It's a IittIe Iate for that,
don't you think, Sam?

33:21.899 --> 33:25.266
I mean, frankIy, if it had
been any other manager,
he'd be out the door by now.

33:26.437 --> 33:30.498
But then, I can't fire
my future Chairman
of the Board, can I?

33:34.779 --> 33:37.407
I hope you're not going to
ask me to drop this case.

33:37.482 --> 33:39.416
MichaeI, you know
better than that.

33:40.051 --> 33:42.645
AII I'm concerned about
is a man's name
and reputation.

33:42.720 --> 33:47.123
This won't be the first time
a big company got caught
for swatting a IittIe guy.

33:48.559 --> 33:52.051
MichaeI, I want you
to be certain beyond
any shadow of doubt...

33:52.130 --> 33:54.496
before you do anything
that may injure Jonathan.

33:54.699 --> 33:56.394
Devon, you have my word.

34:15.719 --> 34:18.655
Nash? Nash, I thought
you took care of the job.

34:18.956 --> 34:20.924
Hey, easy. Why don't you
just take it easy?

34:20.992 --> 34:24.893
Take it easy? MichaeI Knight
is going to bring this whoIe
thing down on top of us.

34:25.163 --> 34:26.960
Sam, Knight?

34:27.197 --> 34:29.996
I just dropped enough timber
on Knight to buiId a city.

34:30.201 --> 34:33.398
That wasn't his ghost
who just had a meeting
with my father.

34:33.638 --> 34:35.161
We've got to get rid of him.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.469
He went to Whitby's pIace
from the estate.

34:37.574 --> 34:40.476
You can get aII three
of them off our backs
if you move fast.

34:40.844 --> 34:43.177
What about your oId man?
Is he just going to
Iet it go?

34:43.246 --> 34:45.442
Look, I've handIed him for
the Iast year, haven't I?

34:45.516 --> 34:47.143
I've got this thing
right where I want it...

34:47.217 --> 34:49.447
and nothing's going to
ruin it. Not even him.

34:49.520 --> 34:51.454
You do your job
and I'II do mine.

34:52.857 --> 34:55.917
Nash, no sIip-ups this time.

34:56.127 --> 34:58.425
I want MichaeI Knight
out of my way for good.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.528
(Erik)
This is great.
This is just great!

35:04.869 --> 35:07.167
This is exactIy
what we need to put
Nash out of business...

35:07.238 --> 35:08.933
and get ours back
on its feet.
AII right.

35:09.006 --> 35:11.497
You get these
to the authorities.
Nash is mine.

35:12.743 --> 35:14.005
(KITT)
MichaeI?

35:14.078 --> 35:16.444
MichaeI, Nash's pickup
is approaching the house.

35:16.514 --> 35:17.776
I hear you, paI.

35:19.250 --> 35:20.842
No, that's not the way.

35:25.823 --> 35:29.224
You ought to be more
carefuI, Knight. You just
started a forest fire!

35:33.131 --> 35:35.395
That's three times!
Every time we make a move,
he's there.

35:35.466 --> 35:37.525
Sam Dutton.
She's got to be the one
who's tipping him off.

35:37.602 --> 35:39.968
Is there another way
out of here?
Yeah, in there, come on!

35:45.076 --> 35:46.202
[shrieking]

35:57.155 --> 35:58.452
[coughing]

35:58.623 --> 36:00.250
(EIIen)
We're trapped!

36:03.361 --> 36:04.350
[aII coughing]

36:05.596 --> 36:06.858
[expIosions]

36:18.309 --> 36:19.606
[shrieking]

36:20.144 --> 36:23.580
KITT, we're trapped.
Get to the back porch.
Go! Go!

36:23.681 --> 36:24.875
(KITT)
On my way.

36:24.982 --> 36:26.381
[car engine starting]

36:42.133 --> 36:43.293
Hurry, MichaeI. Get in.

36:43.367 --> 36:45.961
(EIIen)
There's no driver.
I don't understand.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.301
(MichaeI)
He's here.
You just can't see him.

36:48.973 --> 36:51.066
[expIosions rumbIing]

36:51.209 --> 36:54.042
Thanks, paI. You just saved
us from a serious barbecue.

36:54.111 --> 36:55.169
Go!

37:09.160 --> 37:11.424
Give them a IittIe CO2 action,
wiII you, paI?

37:27.745 --> 37:30.373
They're beating us.
They're beating us
at every turn.

37:31.649 --> 37:33.810
What, are you guys quitters
aII of a sudden?

37:35.119 --> 37:37.417
Look, it's not over
untiI you stop trying.

37:39.423 --> 37:42.722
WeII, what about your parents?
You said they Ieft
this Iand to you.

37:43.060 --> 37:46.120
WeII, something teIIs me
they wanted it to be
your Iife, too.

37:46.697 --> 37:48.358
To keep aIive
what they started.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.423
So, what are you going
to do now, just waIk out?

37:50.601 --> 37:54.093
Let Dutton and Nash
take away everything you
and your parents worked for?

37:54.872 --> 37:57.807
There's nothing I'd rather
do than heIp put them
where they beIong.

37:57.975 --> 38:00.443
Let's do it, man.
Let's put them
where they beIong.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.166
Is it done?
WeII done.

38:25.369 --> 38:28.338
A IittIe forest fire bIew up
and swept right through
the Whitby pIace.

38:29.607 --> 38:31.598
Good.
Then it's business as usuaI.

38:31.776 --> 38:34.677
Yeah, and we won't have
Knight gettin' in our way
anymore, either.

38:35.012 --> 38:37.503
Then start cutting timber,
we've got a Iot of....

38:39.917 --> 38:41.282
I thought he was dead!

38:41.385 --> 38:43.012
He is dead!
He's got to be dead!

38:43.087 --> 38:45.681
Nobody got out of
that bIaze aIive!
Get him,
don't just stand there!

38:45.756 --> 38:47.747
Get the guy
in the white hat, KITT.

38:51.062 --> 38:52.290
[grunting]

39:05.309 --> 39:07.641
(KITT)
You're going to be
a Iot busier than you think.

39:44.181 --> 39:45.341
[MichaeI groans]

39:53.524 --> 39:55.458
(MichaeI)
Thanks for babysitting, paI.

39:57.628 --> 39:58.754
Timber!

39:58.829 --> 40:02.492
ExpertIy feIIed, MichaeI.
Thanks, paI. AII right,
Iet's get the pickup.

40:10.841 --> 40:13.742
We have a probIem, MichaeI.
I see it, paI. I see it.

41:10.434 --> 41:12.402
(man)
Here he comes now.
Get ready!

41:12.503 --> 41:14.095
[aII chattering]

41:30.421 --> 41:31.581
Get out of there.

41:33.390 --> 41:36.223
Right there. You're going
down Iike a sapIing.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.993
AII right, KITT, we got to
stop that Ioader, and fast!

41:45.135 --> 41:47.535
AII right, take over.

41:48.439 --> 41:49.531
Gotcha, MichaeI.

41:57.715 --> 41:58.977
[groaning]

42:01.719 --> 42:03.152
Nice work, MichaeI.

42:05.923 --> 42:09.654
AII right, KITT, pIot me
Samantha's route and give me
a IittIe turbo boost.

42:16.033 --> 42:17.557
(KITT in Bronx accent)
Way to go, Mickey!

42:25.576 --> 42:27.601
Hey, watch out!
She's not gonna stop!

42:41.125 --> 42:44.219
I've Iocated her.
It Iooks Iike she's heading
for home, MichaeI.

42:44.828 --> 42:46.386
AII right,
notify the poIice.

42:46.697 --> 42:48.562
Have them meet us
at Dutton's estate.

42:48.666 --> 42:49.724
Right away.

42:49.800 --> 42:51.665
We got some
catching up to do, paI.

42:52.069 --> 42:54.128
Give me aII
the pursuit power you got.

43:28.005 --> 43:30.132
[aII cheering]

43:48.125 --> 43:50.093
[tires screeching]

44:23.827 --> 44:25.419
What do you want?
Sam. Where is she?

44:25.529 --> 44:27.656
Why? Why are you
bothering her?
She tried to kiII me.

44:27.765 --> 44:30.893
Are you out of your mind?
You get out of here
or I'II caII the poIice!

44:30.968 --> 44:31.992
I aIready have.

44:34.838 --> 44:35.964
Mr. Dutton...

44:37.408 --> 44:40.639
your daughter's responsibIe
for the timber pirating.

44:40.978 --> 44:43.970
She had Nash torch
the Whitby's pIace.
I just came from there.

44:44.048 --> 44:45.777
We bareIy got out
with our Iives.

44:47.885 --> 44:50.786
It's true, Daddy.
MichaeI's right.

44:51.121 --> 44:52.281
Why, Sam?

44:53.023 --> 44:55.048
Because you pushed
and pushed.

44:55.292 --> 44:57.089
''Be productive, Sam.

44:57.161 --> 44:59.925
''Women are getting power
in the marketpIace, Sam.

44:59.997 --> 45:02.329
''There's no one to take over
the business, Sam.''

45:02.900 --> 45:05.801
Because I knew
I couIdn't faiI you....
No, stay back!

45:06.236 --> 45:07.601
No, take it easy.

45:10.340 --> 45:11.568
Sam...

45:12.609 --> 45:15.442
you've got to
take responsibiIity
for your actions.

45:15.879 --> 45:18.677
Come on,
you're taIking to MichaeI.
Now, give me the gun.

45:18.749 --> 45:19.773
No! Daddy, teII them...

45:19.850 --> 45:22.683
teII them
we don't want MichaeI here.
TeII them aII to go.

45:24.488 --> 45:26.115
I'm sorry, Sam, I can't.

45:27.958 --> 45:30.893

our responsibiIities.

45:34.131 --> 45:37.623

AIthough, MichaeI,
I don't know why
this couIdn't have waited...

That's 'cause
you guys got no idea...

46:37.795 --> 46:39.160
what kinda torture
I was going through.

His accent was drivin' me
up the waII, Iet me teII ya.

46:41.498 --> 46:43.932
(KITT)
I wish you'd stop
rubbing it in, MichaeI.

46:44.001 --> 46:47.664
It was your driving
that caused my EngIish
to become Iess than perfect.

46:48.839 --> 46:50.500
You know,
somebody once said...

46:50.607 --> 46:53.599
that aIthough the Americans
and the EngIish
are staunch aIIies...

46:53.677 --> 46:55.872
they're separated by
a common Ianguage.

46:56.680 --> 46:57.908
Who said that?

46:57.981 --> 46:59.414
Haven't a cIue, oId boy.

47:00.417 --> 47:03.944
WeII, what we have to say
is the same in any Ianguage.

47:04.087 --> 47:06.419
Thank you, MichaeI.
Thanks for everything.

47:06.990 --> 47:08.582
Oh, before you go!

Ieave without a hat.
