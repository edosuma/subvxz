00:32.448 --> 00:33.860
Excuse me.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.569
I'm sorry, but I'm lost.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.033
It's okay, where do you want to go?

00:40.207 --> 00:44.201
Boulevard Saint Germain, number 401.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.621
You're not far away.
Boulevard Saint Germain is right...

01:04.690 --> 01:08.479
Help! Please, someone help me!

01:10.737 --> 01:11.944
Hello?

01:13.156 --> 01:14.567
Hello?

01:15.158 --> 01:17.115
Is anyone there?

01:32.676 --> 01:35.544
They have the boy.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.605
<i>Sorry, say that again?</i>

01:47.774 --> 01:50.517
I understand you disagree
with our conclusions.

01:50.694 --> 01:53.937
We gave you leads. An evidence trail
my daughter could follow.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.071
And we followed them. And others.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.654
- Then why aren't you acting?
- Same reason you didn't.

01:58.827 --> 02:01.991
The allegations against Ian Garvey
are mostly circumstantial.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.952
<i>- Do you believe he's a criminal?
- What I believe doesn't matter.</i>

02:06.126 --> 02:08.788
<i>Either you believe he is,
or you believe I'm a liar.</i>

02:08.961 --> 02:10.247
I'm curious which it is.

02:10.422 --> 02:13.210
I have no reason
not to believe you, Agent Keen.

02:13.383 --> 02:17.844
But seeing Garvey stab your husband
is not the same thing as proving he did.

02:18.013 --> 02:20.926
And based on the evidence,
I can't do that.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.465
- There were other leads.
- Yes.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.351
You aren't the first to file
a complaint against Garvey.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.888
We'd like to see those complaints.
Do our own investigation into them.

02:29.066 --> 02:32.230
I assure you, our investigation
was thorough and complete.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.485
Second pair of eyes never hurt.

02:35.113 --> 02:38.606
You know how IA works.
Our sources are confidential.

02:38.784 --> 02:41.322
And I'm asking you to make an exception.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.579
- As a professional courtesy.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

02:44.748 --> 02:49.834
Once our investigation is complete,
our files are confidential. I am sorry.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.508
<i>Mosadek is unhappy.</i>

03:05.686 --> 03:07.427
The seizure was planned.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.187
Throwing the DEA a bone.

03:19.074 --> 03:21.737
<i>The seizure,
losing our contact at the port...</i>

03:21.910 --> 03:26.120
<i>...your obsession with Reddington is
becoming a distraction we cannot afford.</i>

03:26.289 --> 03:28.281
It's under control.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.501
<i>I don't like irony.</i>

03:34.256 --> 03:35.918
Then I wouldn't look in the mirror.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.922
<i>You have been warned.</i>

04:13.336 --> 04:16.454
I'm not in the mood for a matinee.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.961
I have a lead on Garvey.

04:20.135 --> 04:22.091
I had a lead on Garvey.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.969
You made him disappear.

04:24.139 --> 04:28.429
They put Rita Hayworth's picture
on the side of an atom bomb.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.684
Talk about a femme fatale.

04:30.854 --> 04:34.268
How does it feel being
a walking anachronism?

04:34.441 --> 04:36.398
Righteous.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.277
The port manager's ledger?

04:43.450 --> 04:46.909
The port manager who was
the go-between for the Nash Syndicate...

04:47.078 --> 04:49.866
...and their supplier in Afghanistan.

04:50.332 --> 04:54.667
Zarak Mosadek, you'll see
his name several times in there.

04:54.836 --> 04:59.206
He runs an international opium operation
in the Helmand Province.

04:59.841 --> 05:03.255
- He's your lead?
- You didn't have a lead, Elizabeth.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.340
You had an unreliable witness.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.927
A witness who says he saw what he saw.

05:08.099 --> 05:12.810
- Garvey murdering another cop.
- From across an alley, through a window.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.556
No jury would convict
based on his testimony.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.191
You make it sound
like you did me a favor.

05:19.361 --> 05:22.399
I told you, Garvey isn't afraid
of legal threats.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.564
He's afraid of losing power.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.449
The ledger tells us
how to take it from him.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.494
Through this Mosadek?

05:30.664 --> 05:33.532
Garvey is a drug lord
masquerading as a cop.

05:33.708 --> 05:37.952
If we get leverage over his supplier,
we get leverage over him.

05:38.129 --> 05:40.872
Once we have that,
you'll have your revenge.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.790
After you get the duffel bag.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.382
Must be nice.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.679
- What?
- Not having anything...

05:51.852 --> 05:54.310
...precious you wanna keep to yourself.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.351
Tell me about Mosadek.

05:58.525 --> 06:02.314
Zarak Mosadek is Afghanistan's
Deputy Interior Minister...

06:02.487 --> 06:06.572
...for Counter-Narcotics. He's also
the country's biggest drug dealer.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.108
According to Reddington.
Did the DEA confirm?

06:09.286 --> 06:11.528
According to the latest white paper...

06:11.705 --> 06:14.618
...Mosadek stalls investigations
and generally ensures...

06:14.791 --> 06:17.829
...nobody he's associated with
will get arrested for drug crimes.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.495
Why did Red put an Afghan drug lord
on the Blacklist?

06:20.922 --> 06:24.586
The Nash Syndicate answers to Mosadek,
which means Garvey does too.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.921
We get to Mosadek, we get to Garvey.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.463
Reddington knows Mosadek
is untouchable in Afghanistan.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.597
He also knows he's headed to Paris.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.679
<i>He doesn't know why,
just where and when.</i>

06:34.853 --> 06:38.142
Please. I haven't done anything.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.976
Please.

06:40.150 --> 06:43.268
<i>Over 40,000 Americans died
from opioid overdoses last year.</i>

06:43.445 --> 06:45.528
To me, he's an accessory to murder.

06:45.697 --> 06:48.189
Keen, upload the team
on the where and when.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.358
Let's take down two birds
with this stone:

06:50.535 --> 06:53.152
An insidious drug-pusher
and Tom's killer.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.291
Shows what I know.
I thought for sure...

06:59.461 --> 07:03.250
...Navabi was gonna think you giving her
that ring was a proposal.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.540
Because you assume
she wanted to marry me.

07:05.717 --> 07:08.084
That it wasn't just a pit stop,
a way station.

07:08.678 --> 07:13.093
A layover on her way
to her final destination.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.182
Am I interrupting?

07:15.352 --> 07:17.093
- No.
- Yes.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.887
Aram, whenever you have a sec.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.824
I haven't heard back from Kasim.

07:34.663 --> 07:37.030
- Do you trust him?
- With my life.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.824
Then I would trust him with mine.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.621
So, what's the in-flight movie today?

07:47.342 --> 07:49.880
- Where's Elizabeth?
- I'm confused.

07:50.053 --> 07:53.296
You want IA's file on Garvey,
the one you couldn't have?

07:53.473 --> 07:55.009
If I had it, I wouldn't need your help.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.721
To steal their file
which has worthless information?

07:57.894 --> 07:59.931
Information they say is worthless.

08:00.105 --> 08:03.769
Aren't you supposed to be on your way
to Paris? Didn't Red give us a case...

08:03.942 --> 08:07.401
- ...that's going to get us to Garvey?
- I'm sure it will get him to Garvey.

08:07.570 --> 08:11.689
But I plan on getting to him first.
And to do that, I need your help.

08:23.211 --> 08:26.295
<i>- Reddington.</i>
- Agent Navabi.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.000
<i>Perhaps I misunderstood you.</i>

08:28.174 --> 08:31.884
When you dropped us off, you said
you'd be back in an hour. It's been three.

08:32.053 --> 08:35.592
Dembe and I were detoured.
We're in the Latin Quarter...

08:35.765 --> 08:40.510
- ...having a quick visit with an old friend.
- Raymond, I found some Reblochon.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.145
Oh, the Reblochon.

08:43.313 --> 08:47.934
<i>See if he has some quince paste
or walnuts around here somewhere.</i>

08:48.111 --> 08:51.730
I hate to interrupt your vacation,
but if we're gonna intercept...

08:51.906 --> 08:55.445
<i>...a notorious drug supplier,
we need to hear your plan.</i>

08:55.618 --> 08:58.281
- Yes, about that...
<i>- What about that?</i>

09:00.123 --> 09:02.661
A small wrinkle, nothing to fret.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.996
- What's going on?
- Walnuts.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.544
Truth be told...

09:07.714 --> 09:10.798
...I anticipated a dear friend
and contractor...

09:10.967 --> 09:13.675
...by the name of Bunyan Dufour
would be handling...

09:13.845 --> 09:15.928
...Mosadek's security in-country.

09:16.097 --> 09:20.592
He's a trusted operative who's worked
with Mosadek in the past.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.681
Your friend didn't get the job.

09:22.854 --> 09:24.390
<i>Overbid the contract.</i>

09:24.564 --> 09:30.310
Worse yet, it appears Victor Manzon
is now running point on security.

09:30.487 --> 09:34.151
Unfortunately, Victor and I have
something of a sordid past.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.111
I'll spare you the details.

09:36.284 --> 09:40.870
But the long and the short of it is
that if Victor were inclined...

09:41.039 --> 09:44.157
...to hand over Mosadek's security detail
to anyone...

09:44.334 --> 09:46.371
- ...it wouldn't be me.
<i>- Wonderful.</i>

09:46.544 --> 09:50.333
<i>- How do you suggest we find him?</i>
- I wouldn't suggest we do anything.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.500
If you think we're gonna sit around
and wait...

09:53.676 --> 09:56.214
<i>- ... while you drink away the day...</i>
- Save it.

09:57.472 --> 10:01.933
Welcome back. How's the noggin?
You went down like a bag of rocks.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.890
Reddington,
you low-life son-of-a-whore. I swear...

10:05.063 --> 10:06.179
Save it, Victor.

10:06.356 --> 10:09.599
I've had too much to drink to care
what you're saying in any language.

10:09.776 --> 10:14.862
The only thing we are going to discuss
is Zarak Mosadek and whatever rock...

10:15.031 --> 10:18.274
...you and your security firm
are hiding him under.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.864
So let's get down to brass tacks...

10:21.037 --> 10:26.533
...before you and I and your noggin
have another go with the bottle.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.995
Okay, that is a terrible idea.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.708
- Can you track his car?
- Yes.

10:32.882 --> 10:36.000
- It's a government vehicle.
- Can you control the traffic light?

10:36.177 --> 10:39.670
<i>Yes, but he could miss the signal.
He could be texting and driving.</i>

10:39.848 --> 10:40.884
<i>He won't be.</i>

10:41.057 --> 10:43.470
<i>- How can you be so sure?
- He is a stickler...</i>

10:43.643 --> 10:46.727
<i>...for the rules. Otherwise,
he would've given us the file.</i>

10:48.481 --> 10:49.767
Jesus.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.149
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.561
- Are you all right?
- I'm not sure.

10:56.072 --> 11:00.817
Assuming I'm not dead
and he has his laptop in his car...

11:00.994 --> 11:03.452
...and he's uploaded
the file we're looking for...

11:03.621 --> 11:07.080
Which seem like way too many "ands"
to risk one's life over...

11:07.250 --> 11:08.957
- If he does these things...
- And I'm not dead.

11:09.127 --> 11:12.165
- You won't be.
- Because you're sure he's a rule follower.

11:12.338 --> 11:15.126
This man you've met,
I don't know, all of one time.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.916
Okay, if it's any consolation...

11:17.093 --> 11:20.427
...if he doesn't have the file
and he is texting and driving...

11:20.597 --> 11:22.805
...and you do die...

11:22.974 --> 11:24.556
...I will be very sorry.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.931
How long will it take to copy this file?

11:28.479 --> 11:30.846
- Less than a minute.
- Easy, easy.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.273
Just relax, okay?

11:33.443 --> 11:36.356
<i>I programmed the flash drive
to bypass password requirements.</i>

11:36.529 --> 11:40.523
<i>Run a search and download any results
that ping for Ian Garvey.</i>

11:40.700 --> 11:44.819
- I... I got a first aid kit in the car.
- No, no, no. Just...

11:44.996 --> 11:46.908
Can you...

11:47.874 --> 11:48.910
...pray with me?

11:49.709 --> 11:50.916
Pray?

11:54.214 --> 11:55.921
- Okay.
- Easy, easy.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.833
Pray to... I don't know, to...

11:59.010 --> 12:02.094
To give thanks that I'm fine and that...

12:02.680 --> 12:05.764
- ...you weren't texting.
- No, I never text and drive.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.930
Who knew?

12:10.188 --> 12:11.929
Oh, yeah.

12:12.106 --> 12:14.143
Okay, I feel better.

12:18.321 --> 12:22.156
- Glad you could make it.
- Thank you, Donald. Ever the gentleman.

12:22.325 --> 12:25.113
- Do you have a location on Mosadek?
- I do.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.653
Zarak Mosadek and his entourage...

12:27.830 --> 12:31.824
...are currently staying
in an eighth floor penthouse...

12:32.001 --> 12:36.462
...on Avenue KlÃ©ber,
in the 16th arrondissement.

12:36.631 --> 12:39.920
In addition to the two guards
with him at all times...

12:40.093 --> 12:43.211
...there will also be two men assigned
to the room...

12:43.388 --> 12:48.099
...and a scout watching
from an apartment across the street.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.261
And two armed guards
in the lobby of the building.

12:51.437 --> 12:52.553
Is that it?

12:52.730 --> 12:56.849
No. He has three vehicles parked
on the street below.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.393
And assets in the French Police.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.938
And, oh, we mustn't forget
the usual building security...

13:03.116 --> 13:04.197
...and CCTV feeds.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.576
No way. This would take weeks
to plan out correctly.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.327
We won't be able to get inside...

13:09.497 --> 13:11.534
- ...let alone get Mosadek out.
- Oh, come on.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.667
Where's your sense of adventure?
Your esprit de corps?

13:14.836 --> 13:19.547
So you got a way to get this lowlife out
without getting us all killed?

13:19.716 --> 13:21.708
- The elevator.
- Oh, the elevator?

13:21.884 --> 13:25.548
- Oh, my God. You had the same idea.
- Please continue. We're listening.

13:25.722 --> 13:29.306
Well, the first obstacle is access
to the building.

13:29.475 --> 13:32.343
<i>Fortunately, Dembe has
a Sudanese contact...</i>

13:32.520 --> 13:36.184
...who helps to find work
for young immigrants in the city.

13:36.357 --> 13:40.601
Dembe's contact will arrange
for coded security badges...

13:40.778 --> 13:44.488
...which gets us into the building,
which brings us to Jean-Philippe.

13:44.657 --> 13:48.241
- And Jean-Philippe is?
<i>- A delightful little firecracker...</i>

13:48.411 --> 13:50.528
<i>...with whom I've become acquainted.</i>

13:50.705 --> 13:53.493
<i>He's a proud Parisian,
which can be frustrating at times.</i>

13:53.666 --> 13:57.250
<i>He understands English perfectly,
but refuses to speak a lick.</i>

13:57.420 --> 14:00.254
Perhaps you can brush up
on your French, Navabi.

14:00.423 --> 14:03.382
At any rate,
Jean-Philippe will work ahead of us...

14:03.551 --> 14:06.464
...and run an intercept
to the building's security feeds.

14:06.637 --> 14:09.675
Making it possible for us
to throw them into darkness...

14:09.849 --> 14:12.341
...and steal their feeds
at the flip of a switch.

14:12.518 --> 14:16.432
While that's in the works,
I need you to handle the exit strategy.

14:16.606 --> 14:17.596
Meaning?

14:19.067 --> 14:22.560
Vehicles that have been reconfigured
to blend into the city.

14:22.737 --> 14:26.447
The police prefecture need
to know nothing of this adventure.

14:26.616 --> 14:30.360
Rather, I thought Agent Navabi
might have a contact in Mossad...

14:30.536 --> 14:34.826
...who could assist with such a request.
I'm sure she's owed a favor or two.

14:35.541 --> 14:39.160
- Promise not to shoot the messenger?
- Depends on the message.

14:39.837 --> 14:43.501
Aram seems down that you didn't think
that ring came with a proposal.

14:43.674 --> 14:46.166
That I'd think it
even though he didn't say it?

14:46.344 --> 14:48.927
Who put that idiotic idea in his head?

14:49.097 --> 14:51.760
<i>While you have us running around
in circles...</i>

14:51.933 --> 14:55.301
- ...what are you gonna do?
- I'll be at a lovely cafe...

14:55.478 --> 15:00.439
...Rue de Turrene, enjoying the best cup
of hot chocolate in all of Paris.

15:00.608 --> 15:03.726
<i>While there,
I'll meet with Kristos Matthias...</i>

15:03.903 --> 15:07.317
...a Greek munitions contact
who has a tendency...

15:07.490 --> 15:09.197
...to put his thumb on the scale...

15:09.367 --> 15:13.156
...but on short notice, he's the only one
who can supply us with the charges...

15:13.329 --> 15:16.367
- ...needed to blow the elevator.
- Blow the elevator?

15:16.541 --> 15:20.125
Right. Well, while rigging
the CCTV network...

15:20.294 --> 15:24.208
...Jean-Philippe will also set charges
that will detonate...

15:24.382 --> 15:27.716
<i>...at the moment that Mosadek
and his men are in the elevator...</i>

15:27.885 --> 15:30.673
<i>...out of reach from the rest
of their security team.</i>

15:30.847 --> 15:32.930
Thereby dropping the car
down the shaft...

15:33.099 --> 15:36.718
...then engaging the emergency breaks
just as they arrive in the basement...

15:36.894 --> 15:40.353
...where we'll be waiting
to dispatch the guards, grab Mosadek...

15:40.523 --> 15:43.015
...and flee while the rest
of the team scrambles.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.400
We'll kill him in the fall. Too big a risk.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.778
Risk comes from not knowing
what you're doing.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.314
Assuming this works,
we still need to get him...

15:50.491 --> 15:53.154
...out, into the safe house
and convince him to talk.

15:53.327 --> 15:57.537
Yes, but one thing at a time.
Isn't it funny how things work out?

15:57.707 --> 16:01.451
Five years later
and here you are with me in Paris...

16:01.627 --> 16:04.290
...preparing to steal
a wanted man off the elevator.

16:04.464 --> 16:08.299
It's almost as if you didn't try
to kill me in Belgrade years ago.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.084
No, it's not.

16:10.261 --> 16:13.345
Well, either way, if we pull this off...

16:13.514 --> 16:15.676
...you'll have something
to tell the grandkids.

16:15.850 --> 16:19.139
With a knick-knack paddywhack,
give the dog a bone...

16:19.312 --> 16:21.975
...this old man came rolling home.

16:25.860 --> 16:29.149
Internal Affairs audited
Garvey's bank accounts...

16:29.322 --> 16:31.314
...ran backgrounds
on friends and family...

16:31.491 --> 16:35.360
- ...had a revolving tail for weeks.
- And came up empty.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.578
We assumed
this file would give us a lead.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.115
We took this incredible risk to get it...

16:41.292 --> 16:43.124
Well, I did, anyway.

16:43.294 --> 16:44.876
...because we assumed.

16:45.046 --> 16:48.710
When you assume something amazing
is gonna happen and it doesn't...

16:48.883 --> 16:52.092
- ...it sucks.
- Or that's what's amazing about it.

16:52.261 --> 16:55.800
- There's nothing amazing about sucking.
- What doesn't happen.

16:55.973 --> 17:00.718
What you're not expecting,
what you have no assumptions about.

17:00.895 --> 17:03.137
- I looked at the surveillance logs.
- Look again.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.396
Where he goes every Friday at 12:30.

17:06.733 --> 17:09.067
Pete's Tavern.
Maybe he likes their hot wings.

17:09.237 --> 17:12.275
- Maybe he'll be there tomorrow.
- They had him under surveillance.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.906
- All he did was eat lunch.
- At a bar in Baltimore.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.568
Over 50 miles away from his office.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.780
The surveillance team assumed
he went for the hot wings...

17:21.958 --> 17:25.326
...but does anybody really like
hot wings that much?

17:26.503 --> 17:29.747
I mean, does anybody know
what hot wings really are?

17:30.591 --> 17:33.254
Yeah. Delicious.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.057
- He's on the move.
- Copy that. Target en route.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.350
Here we go.

17:49.527 --> 17:52.486
- Jean-Philippe, are you ready?
- Ready and set, my love.

17:52.655 --> 17:56.148
Until you tell me otherwise,
I will simply sit and listen...

17:56.325 --> 17:59.193
...and drink in the sound
of your velvet voice.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.750
There's our call.
Elevator is in motion. Are you set?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.751
Affirmative. Dembe's a go.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.331
In place on your cue.

18:13.718 --> 18:14.754
Okay.

18:14.927 --> 18:19.422
- Give me cameras.
- That voice. It is like honey in my rum.

18:21.100 --> 18:25.515
<i>- Your cameras, they have arrived?</i>
- Affirmative. I have eyes. Eighth floor.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.600
Here we go. Jean-Philippe, hold.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.516
<i>Of course, my love.</i>

18:33.571 --> 18:36.279
Tamer says we just lost
all our security feeds.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.573
Wait!

18:39.076 --> 18:40.988
Jean-Philippe, go. Now. Blow it.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.829
- Oh, no.
- What's, "Oh, no"?

18:52.006 --> 18:54.123
- Did it work?
<i>- One of the cables held.</i>

18:54.300 --> 18:55.461
<i>It's on the third floor.</i>

18:55.635 --> 18:58.173
- Ressler, a hand, please.
- On my way.

18:58.346 --> 19:01.464
It was the charges!
That Greek gave us bad charges!

19:01.641 --> 19:05.260
Those charges were not strong enough
to sever the line.

19:20.451 --> 19:21.817
Watch out!

19:31.212 --> 19:32.794
Let's go, let's go.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.716
Come on, Dembe.

19:37.885 --> 19:38.921
Up, up.

19:41.806 --> 19:44.844
Dembe, come on!
We don't have time. Jesus Christ.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.927
Come on, let's go, let's go.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.300
Hurry, let's go.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.340
It's them! Stop!

20:32.898 --> 20:33.934
Go.

20:50.249 --> 20:53.083
I'm sorry about what happened
with Samar.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.416
- I feel like I gave you bad advice.
- It wasn't bad.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.171
It was terrible.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.091
But it's my fault for taking it.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.253
- Can I give you some good advice?
- Doubt it.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.296
If you want to propose, propose.

21:06.474 --> 21:09.592
- Why? So she can say no?
- You don't know that's what she'll say.

21:09.769 --> 21:13.433
You said if I give her the ring
and she doesn't think it's a proposal...

21:13.606 --> 21:17.475
- ...then she doesn't wanna marry me.
- I know I said that. I'm an idiot.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.062
Socially.

21:19.236 --> 21:22.149
Professionally, you're kind of a savant.

21:33.167 --> 21:36.160
IA did more than assume
Garvey came here for wings.

21:36.337 --> 21:40.081
They vetted all the employees,
found nothing.

21:40.674 --> 21:45.169
Maybe he's here to meet someone.
Out-of-the-way place, no prying eyes.

21:45.346 --> 21:48.589
That makes sense,
but the file says he was always alone.

21:48.766 --> 21:50.883
Money laundering, extortion...

21:51.519 --> 21:53.476
He's here for a reason.

21:54.188 --> 21:56.931
Something IA missed,
but we're gonna find.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.851
And we're not leaving here till we do.

22:08.202 --> 22:11.866
Who are you?
Where is he? Why am I here?

22:12.039 --> 22:15.453
You and I share a problem.
You're here to help me solve it.

22:15.626 --> 22:18.118
Where is he? We made an agreement.

22:18.295 --> 22:21.663
I did what you asked.
I brought the diamonds.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.625
Did you?

22:26.220 --> 22:28.337
All I care about is my son.

22:36.522 --> 22:39.014
I'm afraid there's been
a misunderstanding.

22:39.191 --> 22:43.105
You want more money? Is that it?
Tell me. Name your price.

22:43.571 --> 22:45.403
Ian Garvey.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.361
- What?
- Cutting his supply.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.947
Taking away his power.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.531
That's my price.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.322
And if I do this, you let Mateen go?

22:55.499 --> 22:56.865
No.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.667
Because I didn't take him.

23:01.547 --> 23:03.413
Then why did you take me?

23:03.591 --> 23:05.958
To convince you to cut ties with Garvey.

23:06.135 --> 23:10.049
I was planning on forcing the issue.
Now I can give to get.

23:10.514 --> 23:14.679
You do what I want,
I'll make sure you get your son back.

23:15.311 --> 23:16.552
Who are you?

23:16.729 --> 23:19.392
Forgive me. I'm Raymond Reddington.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.934
I know you.

23:25.029 --> 23:28.238
- You and Garvey...
- Are having a bit of a dustup.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.490
Which I imagine has taken a toll...

23:30.659 --> 23:33.777
...on his various business interests,
including yours.

23:34.955 --> 23:39.074
Our shared problem is Ian Garvey.

23:39.251 --> 23:42.335
- I can get Mateen on my own.
- Maybe.

23:42.504 --> 23:44.837
But we're going to do it for you.

23:45.007 --> 23:48.421
I get Garvey, you get Mateen.
Are we agreed?

23:49.595 --> 23:53.214
Of course we are.
You won't leave here alive if we aren't.

23:53.390 --> 23:54.881
So...

23:55.684 --> 23:57.641
...who took your son?

23:58.520 --> 24:00.978
He says the Taliban took his kid?

24:01.148 --> 24:04.732
Mosadek's a player on the opium trade.
He does business with the Taliban.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.768
Then why would they go after him?

24:06.946 --> 24:10.781
They believe Mosadek's an informant
for the U.S. military.

24:10.950 --> 24:15.069
I have no doubt we'd prop up a heroin
dealer in exchange for intel on terrorists.

24:15.245 --> 24:19.159
But why aren't there any Navy SEALs
to help him get his kid back?

24:19.333 --> 24:23.247
The relationship is only valuable
to the Pentagon if it's a secret.

24:23.420 --> 24:28.085
If your sea lions showed up in Paris
to save the son, it wouldn't be.

24:28.258 --> 24:31.171
- What is the son doing in Paris?
- Boarding school.

24:31.345 --> 24:34.884
You want to involve us in a war
between rival opium traders.

24:35.057 --> 24:38.095
I'll get in touch with Cooper.
Run this up the flagpole.

24:38.268 --> 24:40.225
Excellent. I'll be at the Louvre.

24:40.396 --> 24:43.764
When you're done dotting your I's
and crossing your T's...

24:43.941 --> 24:48.561
...you can find me gazing in erotic wonder
at the beauty and power...

24:48.737 --> 24:51.229
...of the <i>Winged Victory of Samothrace.</i>

24:52.658 --> 24:56.151
- Thank you for coming on short notice.
- Pleasure's all mine.

24:56.328 --> 25:01.665
It's fun finding out what nasty freak show
Reddington's got you chasing after.

25:02.459 --> 25:05.293
- Who is it this time?
- Zarak Mosadek.

25:07.214 --> 25:10.753
You want my non-denial now,
or should we play footsie first?

25:11.760 --> 25:16.255
Mosadek is an informant for the CIA.
He's also a player in the opium trade.

25:16.432 --> 25:19.925
His product is kissed into this country
through Baltimore...

25:20.102 --> 25:22.094
...and kills thousands of young people.

25:22.271 --> 25:25.605
If you're asking for permission
to put a noose on Mosadek, you have it.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.891
You have authorization to cut him loose?

25:30.112 --> 25:33.230
Whether Mosadek was
in the employ of the CIA...

25:33.407 --> 25:35.990
...I am not going to non-deny deny.

25:36.160 --> 25:39.449
What I will not deny is
that he is no longer in their employ...

25:39.621 --> 25:42.910
...if he ever was, which I will not confirm.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.083
Or deny.

25:45.252 --> 25:47.585
The Taliban has taken his son hostage.

25:47.755 --> 25:49.587
My people know where the boy's held.

25:49.757 --> 25:54.127
I assume you'll want to inform the agency
so they can extract him.

25:54.303 --> 25:55.510
Why would they?

25:55.679 --> 25:58.342
Because of his father's relationship
with us.

25:58.515 --> 26:01.849
Perhaps, but it's the Taliban's knowledge
of that relationship...

26:02.019 --> 26:04.477
...which caused the agency to sever ties.

26:05.522 --> 26:07.514
If there were ever ties to sever.

26:07.691 --> 26:10.399
The agency has authorization
to operate overseas.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.811
They won't get involved and you can't.

26:12.988 --> 26:17.323
You also can't involve local authorities
without exposing our relationship.

26:17.493 --> 26:22.363
The one that you won't admit you have?
Cynthia, the boy is just a boy.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.705
Sorry, Harold.

26:25.292 --> 26:28.330
But my hands are tied,
and so are yours.

26:31.673 --> 26:36.088
Okay, so I reran the background checks
and I was right.

26:36.261 --> 26:37.877
Everyone who works here is clean.

26:38.055 --> 26:41.344
No criminal record,
barely even a speeding ticket.

26:41.517 --> 26:44.601
- And he isn't here to meet anyone.
- How can you tell?

26:44.770 --> 26:47.103
Because Garvey hasn't touched
his phone.

26:47.272 --> 26:50.515
- So?
- So he's been here 45 minutes.

26:50.692 --> 26:53.400
If the person is late,
wouldn't he have called?

26:53.570 --> 26:55.732
Or wouldn't Garvey have tried him?

26:55.906 --> 27:00.276
If everyone who works here is clean
and he's not here to meet anyone...

27:00.452 --> 27:03.490
...he's not sending any signal
that we can detect...

27:03.664 --> 27:06.327
...maybe he does just like the wings.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.834
He hasn't ordered any wings.
He hasn't ordered any food.

27:10.003 --> 27:12.962
He came all this way
and all he ordered was a beer.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.249
And now he's leaving.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.132
This doesn't make any sense.

27:17.302 --> 27:21.046
He drove over an hour,
nursed one beer, talked to no one...

27:21.223 --> 27:22.885
...and then leaves?

27:23.058 --> 27:25.675
Why? Who does that?

27:27.896 --> 27:30.138
- Who is she?
- Okay.

27:30.315 --> 27:34.730
Okay, that looks like Lillian May Roth, 35.

27:34.903 --> 27:38.613
Worked here for two years.
Before that, she lived in Virginia.

27:38.782 --> 27:42.071
Never married. No kids. Nothing.

27:42.244 --> 27:44.110
Not to him.

27:45.080 --> 27:48.073
She's worth an hour's drive
to kiss her goodbye.

27:48.250 --> 27:51.163
Garvey's married.
You think he's having an affair?

27:52.045 --> 27:53.752
I don't know.

27:54.339 --> 27:57.002
But I'm definitely gonna find out.

28:15.986 --> 28:18.103
- You can hear me?
<i>- Hear and see you.</i>

28:18.280 --> 28:21.398
You'll be fine.
Just do exactly as they instructed.

28:24.745 --> 28:27.738
These men hurt my son.
Understand, I will kill them.

28:27.915 --> 28:30.532
Nobody's killing anybody.
This is unofficial.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.793
Our boss is breaking the rules
to do the right thing.

28:33.962 --> 28:37.296
<i>- Do you see the marker?
- Straight ahead on your right.</i>

28:41.094 --> 28:42.835
The angel.

28:43.263 --> 28:45.300
- Excuse me?
- Go past the crying angel...

28:45.474 --> 28:47.932
...then two rows on your right.

29:02.491 --> 29:04.824
I need your cell phone
and the radio in your ear.

29:04.993 --> 29:08.282
If you don't do as I say, they will kill him.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.341
- Are you seeing this?
<i>- I am.</i>

29:21.510 --> 29:22.967
<i>What did he give you?</i>

29:23.136 --> 29:26.720
Mosadek, can you hear me?
What did he give you?

29:30.811 --> 29:32.723
Navabi, that car.

29:43.907 --> 29:46.274
- He's gone.
- What do you mean, he's gone?

29:46.451 --> 29:50.070
- There's nowhere to go.
- No tracks. Nothing. He's gone.

30:02.718 --> 30:06.052
- You lost him?
- One minute he was here, the next, gone.

30:06.221 --> 30:08.429
- Hey, Navabi.
- What is it?

30:10.267 --> 30:12.054
Charpentier.

30:13.103 --> 30:17.097
- What the kid gave him.
<i>- Either Mosadek lost your tail...</i>

30:17.274 --> 30:19.140
<i>...and has no intention
of being found...</i>

30:19.318 --> 30:23.107
...or he was taken by the same people
who abducted his son.

30:23.739 --> 30:25.196
Over here!

30:35.709 --> 30:38.076
- Where does that lead?
- What? What is it?

30:38.253 --> 30:40.870
It's a hatch on the floor of a mausoleum.

30:42.299 --> 30:46.669
A ruse. They knew you'd be watching
and needed a way to get Mosadek out.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.178
- Out how? Take him where?
- The catacombs.

30:51.892 --> 30:53.975
Please. My son, is he okay?

30:54.144 --> 30:56.978
- Quiet. Keep walking.
<i>- The catacombs run under the city.</i>

30:57.147 --> 31:00.106
- They could resurface anywhere.
- I'm going in.

31:00.275 --> 31:02.062
Dembe, Quartier De La Gare.

31:02.235 --> 31:05.694
<i>- What are you thinking?</i>
- I'm hoping we can intercept them.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.776
Raymond, where are we going?

31:07.949 --> 31:10.908
- Pinky Schmidt. Remember him?
- The German bank robber?

31:11.078 --> 31:14.947
Tried to convince me to come in on
that plan to steal the medieval tapestry...

31:15.123 --> 31:17.706
- ...from that church in Paris.
- You turned him down.

31:17.876 --> 31:21.335
And the tapestry remains. He's always
been flakey on the follow-through...

31:21.505 --> 31:25.215
...but he did have an ingenious plan
of how to get it out of the church...

31:25.384 --> 31:27.467
- ...without anyone knowing.
- The cemetery.

31:27.636 --> 31:30.470
The same cemetery
where Mosadek was abducted.

31:30.639 --> 31:34.599
Closest access point to the catacombs.
We're going to that church.

31:54.037 --> 31:58.077
These men work on behalf
of your rivals in Kandahar.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.116
You brought something they want.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.632
My son. Please.

32:16.476 --> 32:17.512
Father.

32:17.686 --> 32:20.724
Mateen, my boy. It's okay.
Everything will be okay.

32:21.898 --> 32:24.106
What are you doing?
I brought what you asked.

32:24.276 --> 32:27.815
- We want something else.
- I'm begging you. What do you want?

32:27.988 --> 32:29.274
We want information.

32:29.448 --> 32:32.907
I don't have information.
What are you doing?!

32:33.076 --> 32:35.318
We know you're feeding info
to the Americans.

32:35.495 --> 32:38.784
We also know you are one of six.
We want the names of the others.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.869
- Let him go.
- I want the names...

32:41.042 --> 32:43.750
- ...or the boy dies.
- I don't know any names.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.206
I don't know their names!

32:45.380 --> 32:47.667
But you do.
And only their lives will save him.

32:47.841 --> 32:48.877
I am begging you!

32:53.388 --> 32:55.004
You. With me. Now!

32:59.686 --> 33:01.393
Cover me.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.739
Excuse me. Excuse me.

33:21.917 --> 33:26.332
I'm sorry, but we have an emergency.

33:27.297 --> 33:30.961
You don't understand a word I'm saying.
English? Yes, English it is.

33:31.134 --> 33:33.968
We have a bit of an emergency.
Some kind of gas leak.

33:34.137 --> 33:37.471
Gas leak. Evacuate, please.

33:37.641 --> 33:40.384
And we need everyone
to exit through the front.

33:40.560 --> 33:43.598
- Now. Evacuate now.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33:43.772 --> 33:45.434
What's going on?

33:45.607 --> 33:47.849
Gas leak.
We need everyone out right away.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.062
What gas leak?

33:49.611 --> 33:52.649
We're not sure, we think
from the furnace in the basement.

33:52.822 --> 33:55.656
- The thing could...
- We don't have a basement.

33:56.451 --> 33:58.784
Right. Please, everyone.

33:58.954 --> 34:01.537
- We need to clear the church now.
- Raymond!

34:01.706 --> 34:03.117
I'm sor...

34:09.005 --> 34:10.621
Reddington.

34:13.426 --> 34:15.042
Don't shoot.

34:17.597 --> 34:20.510
- I will kill him. I swear I will.
- Whoever you are...

34:20.684 --> 34:23.893
- ...you aren't walking out of here.
- No? Maybe.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.018
But if I am going to die today...

34:26.188 --> 34:28.556
...I'm taking his boy with me.

34:33.655 --> 34:35.897
Raymond, we have to go.

34:39.536 --> 34:41.822
I'm truly sorry for all of this.

34:41.996 --> 34:44.989
I hope everyone is okay.
You'll be happy to know...

34:45.166 --> 34:47.829
...the gas leak is completely resolved.

34:48.003 --> 34:50.165
I'm sorry for the disruption.

34:51.547 --> 34:53.210
The stones.

34:59.180 --> 35:03.595
My apologies. I hope this helps
to cover the damages. Au revoir.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.993
Bill, your cab's here.

35:28.585 --> 35:31.953
- Did I call one?
- No, I did. Go sleep it off.

35:32.130 --> 35:36.124
- You can pick up your car in the morning.
- You are an angel of mercy.

35:36.968 --> 35:40.052
- You're six sheets to the wind.
- Seven and a half.

35:41.264 --> 35:43.130
Oh, and I'm broke.

35:50.857 --> 35:52.268
Here.

35:52.901 --> 35:56.690
This will cover the cab. Pay me back
when you pick up your car.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.326
Go to sleep.

36:09.542 --> 36:11.249
Drink water!

36:11.878 --> 36:13.039
Hello?

36:13.672 --> 36:15.755
I... I left my purse.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.129
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.389
I think I left it in the bathroom.

36:25.558 --> 36:26.924
Sure.

36:28.478 --> 36:30.515
I'm always losing everything.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.430
My wallet, my keys.

36:32.607 --> 36:36.647
My name is Elizabeth Keen.
I'm a special agent with the FBI.

36:36.820 --> 36:38.903
You need to come with me.

36:47.539 --> 36:52.409
Mr. Reddington, I can't express
how grateful I am for what you've done.

36:53.211 --> 36:56.921
You can express your gratitude
by making good on our agreement.

36:57.841 --> 36:59.332
Yes.

36:59.509 --> 37:01.546
Ian Garvey.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.344
Tell me what you want.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.717
I have a long
and unhealthy list of wants.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.852
But when it comes to Garvey,
I have but one.

37:12.021 --> 37:15.105
It has to do with a meeting
I need you to arrange.

37:15.275 --> 37:19.189
A meeting that concerns your operation.

37:29.998 --> 37:32.832
The bureau is investigating Garvey.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.707
From your apartment.

37:37.881 --> 37:42.046
I don't know your relation to him,
but you mean a great deal to him...

37:42.218 --> 37:45.336
...which means you must know
a great deal about him.

37:49.017 --> 37:52.886
I know that he's good at his job.
And respected by his colleagues.

37:53.062 --> 37:55.395
We're building a case against him.

37:56.357 --> 37:59.191
I brought you here to show you
what we know, what we don't...

37:59.360 --> 38:02.899
...and to get your help to fill in the gaps.
You can either cooperate...

38:03.072 --> 38:05.564
...or be charged
as a conspirator to his crimes.

38:05.742 --> 38:07.153
What crimes?

38:07.994 --> 38:11.203
To begin with, he murdered my husband.

38:25.220 --> 38:26.461
<i>I've received word.</i>

38:26.638 --> 38:27.879
<i>He wants to meet.</i>

38:28.056 --> 38:30.423
Meet? No.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.968
I'm not flying to Afghanistan
if that's what he thinks.

38:40.777 --> 38:43.394
<i>He's coming here to you.</i>

38:48.493 --> 38:51.201
- You are to be congratulated.
- And criticized.

38:51.371 --> 38:53.488
We saved the son, but let the father go.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.578
I've seen Mosadek's intel file.

38:56.751 --> 39:00.461
He helped the agency kill
or capture several high-value targets.

39:00.630 --> 39:03.668
Besides, you didn't let him go.
You put him in Reddington's debt.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.380
A place I wouldn't wish
on my worst enemy.

39:06.553 --> 39:10.012
Go home. Get some rest.
You've earned it.

39:12.892 --> 39:13.928
Agents.

39:16.145 --> 39:19.354
Cynthia. To what do I owe the pleasure?

39:19.524 --> 39:22.608
Harold, do you recall my...

39:22.777 --> 39:27.522
...rather explicit directions to avoid
involvement in the Mosadek affair?

39:28.783 --> 39:31.400
Do you want my non-denial denial...

39:31.578 --> 39:33.865
...or should we play footsie first?

39:38.501 --> 39:43.747
Listen, about Aram thinking
that you'd think he'd propose...

39:43.923 --> 39:47.507
- I still can't believe he thought that.
- He didn't. I did.

39:47.677 --> 39:51.796
And I kind of, you know,
made him think that you would too.

39:59.731 --> 40:02.849
Ressler is an idiot.
You're a bigger idiot for believing him.

40:03.026 --> 40:04.142
Why? He was right.

40:04.319 --> 40:07.778
No, he wasn't. He said I'd think
you giving me a ring was a proposal.

40:07.947 --> 40:10.690
And you would've
if you had wanted to marry me.

40:10.867 --> 40:13.575
- Did he tell you that too?
- No, Agent Keen did.

40:14.412 --> 40:19.077
Stop asking advice from people
who have only had terrible relationships.

40:19.250 --> 40:22.994
If you wanted to marry me, you would've
assumed it was an engagement ring.

40:23.171 --> 40:26.209
No, only if you had asked me
to get engaged.

40:26.382 --> 40:28.465
Should I assume you didn't
because you don't?

40:28.635 --> 40:30.797
Should I assume you don't
because you didn't?

40:30.970 --> 40:32.461
Okay, look.

40:33.514 --> 40:34.595
I love this ring.

40:35.600 --> 40:39.184
I know it was an heirloom. It means
a lot to me you wanted me to have it.

40:39.354 --> 40:42.188
- I'm glad.
- But by not asking the big question...

40:42.357 --> 40:46.601
...you have raised other questions
that I think we both need to answer...

40:47.570 --> 40:49.311
...so until we do...

40:49.489 --> 40:52.778
...I think you should take it back.

41:01.584 --> 41:03.667
<i>So that's what we know.</i>

41:03.836 --> 41:08.456
We can connect Garvey to two murders
and providing protection to a drug cartel.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.716
But we can't prove any of it.

41:11.636 --> 41:13.878
Tell me what you know...

41:14.055 --> 41:15.387
...and maybe we can.

41:15.556 --> 41:18.469
What I know about Ian is,
he's a good man.

41:19.268 --> 41:23.558
He's looked after me since I was a kid.
Been like a father to me.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.815
I know...

41:26.985 --> 41:29.477
...how difficult this must be for you.

41:29.654 --> 41:33.273
Trust me, I know what it's like
to have a father who's a criminal.

41:33.449 --> 41:35.987
Look, Ian isn't my father.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.197
He protected me from my father.

41:38.371 --> 41:40.988
Got me into Witness Protection
to keep my father away.

41:41.165 --> 41:44.249
Wait, you were in WITSEC?

41:44.419 --> 41:46.581
For most of my life, yeah.

41:47.422 --> 41:50.290
And now I know why.
The FBI spends more time...

41:50.466 --> 41:53.049
...looking for good people
like my surrogate father...

41:53.219 --> 41:55.427
...rather than bad people
like my real one.

41:56.055 --> 41:57.421
Your real father...

42:00.018 --> 42:03.432
Perhaps you've heard of him.
His name's Raymond Reddington.

42:04.355 --> 42:07.598
He's been on the FBI's Most Wanted list
for 20 years.

42:07.775 --> 42:10.438
You're Raymond Reddington's daughter?

42:12.780 --> 42:15.147
Why do you look so surprised?

42:19.037 --> 42:21.700
Because I am too.
