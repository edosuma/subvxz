>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:36.066 --> 00:37.233
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:37.300 --> 00:41.400
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:41.467 --> 00:42.000
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:42.066 --> 00:42.567
US.

00:42.633 --> 00:43.567
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:43.633 --> 00:46.233
THE WEEK, A WEEK WHICH, AMONG

00:46.300 --> 00:48.166
MANY, MANY OTHER THINGS, SAW THE

00:48.233 --> 00:49.667
PRESIDENT, A MAN WHO CLAIMS HE

00:49.734 --> 00:51.233
SPEAKS FOR FORGOTTEN WORKING

00:51.300 --> 00:52.233
CLASS AMERICANS, MANAGING TO GET

00:52.300 --> 00:53.467
AN APPLAUSE LINE IN A SPEECH

00:53.533 --> 00:54.467
FROM THIS.

00:54.533 --> 00:55.567
>> WE GOT MORE MONEY, WE GOT

00:55.633 --> 00:57.166
MORE BRAINS, WE GOT BETTER

00:57.233 --> 00:58.767
HOUSES, APARTMENTS.

00:58.834 --> 00:59.867
WE GOT NICER BOATS.

00:59.934 --> 01:03.333
WE'RE SMARTER THAN THEY ARE.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.266
AND THEY SAY THE ELITE --

01:04.333 --> 01:05.300
WE'RE THE ELITE.

01:05.367 --> 01:06.166
YOU'RE THE ELITE.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.400
>> John: WOW.

01:07.467 --> 01:08.400
"WE HAVE NICER BOATS THAN THEY

01:08.467 --> 01:09.233
DO."

01:09.300 --> 01:10.367
ASIDE FROM THE FACT HE'S

01:10.433 --> 01:11.767
DELIVERING THAT SPEECH TO A

01:11.834 --> 01:14.166
CROWD IN FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA --

01:14.233 --> 01:18.033
WHICH IS LANDLOCKED --

01:18.100 --> 01:19.266
THAT IS JUST A WEIRD MESSAGE FOR

01:19.333 --> 01:20.266
A POPULIST.

01:20.333 --> 01:21.033
IT'S LIKE RUNNING AS A SOCIALIST

01:21.100 --> 01:22.166
UNDER THE SLOGAN

01:22.233 --> 01:23.367
"THE WORKERS ARE PARASITES!

01:23.433 --> 01:25.533
SPONSORED BY PRINGLES."

01:25.600 --> 01:26.367
BUT CLEARLY THE BIGGEST AND MOST

01:26.433 --> 01:27.200
HISTORIC NEWS OF THE WEEK CAME

01:27.266 --> 01:28.467
ON WEDNESDAY.

01:28.533 --> 01:29.734
>> TONIGHT, THE BIGGEST CHANGE

01:29.800 --> 01:31.066
FOR THE SUPREME COURT IN HALF A

01:31.133 --> 01:32.433
CENTURY: SWING JUSTICE

01:32.500 --> 01:33.834
ANTHONY KENNEDY ANNOUNCING HIS

01:33.900 --> 01:36.533
RETIREMENT, GIVING

01:36.600 --> 01:38.200
PRESIDENT TRUMP ANOTHER SEAT TO

01:38.266 --> 01:41.200
FILL AND CONSERVATIVES A SHOT TO

01:41.266 --> 01:42.467
DOMINATE THE HIGHEST COURT FOR

01:42.533 --> 01:44.900
YEARS TO COME.

01:44.967 --> 01:46.333
>> John: NOW, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY

01:46.400 --> 01:46.934
HUGE NEWS, AND FOR ANYONE WHO

01:47.000 --> 01:47.900
BELIEVES THAT THE CONSTITUTION

01:47.967 --> 01:48.700
PROTECTS THINGS LIKE

01:48.767 --> 01:49.700
REPRODUCTIVE AND LGBT RIGHTS,

01:49.767 --> 01:54.800
THIS IS BAD.

01:54.867 --> 01:55.500
AND WE KNOW IT'S BAD BECAUSE

01:55.567 --> 01:56.367
DONALD TRUMP JR. WAS HAPPY,

01:56.433 --> 01:57.533
TWEETING "OMG!

01:57.600 --> 01:59.166
JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT THIS WEEK

01:59.233 --> 02:00.700
COULDN'T GET MORE LIT,

02:00.767 --> 02:02.800
I GIVE YOU ANTHONY KENNEDY'S

02:02.867 --> 02:03.967
RETIREMENT FROM #SCOTUS."

02:04.033 --> 02:05.033
AND I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO HAVE

02:05.100 --> 02:08.767
TO DISAGREE WITH MR. JUNIOR ON

02:08.834 --> 02:09.967
THIS, BECAUSE I PERSONALLY DON'T

02:10.033 --> 02:11.734
THINK THIS WAS LIT AT ALL.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.066
I MEAN, IT'S OBVS CRAY AF.

02:13.133 --> 02:16.567
NO ONE IS DENYING THAT, FAM.

02:16.633 --> 02:18.300
BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT THIS NEWS

02:18.367 --> 02:19.934
WAS NEITHER LIT NOR ON FLEEK.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.066
NOR WAS IT THREE FIRE EMOJIS.

02:21.133 --> 02:22.900
NOW, GRANTED, I AM STILL A

02:22.967 --> 02:25.300
LITTLE SHOOK, JSYK, BUT I

02:25.367 --> 02:26.533
PERSONALLY BELIEVE KENNEDY'S

02:26.600 --> 02:27.600
RETIREMENT IS SUPER WERPT.

02:27.667 --> 02:28.734
AND I'M HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT,

02:28.800 --> 02:29.600
IN SAYING THAT, ALL THE SLANG

02:29.667 --> 02:30.667
WORDS I JUST USED ARE NOW

02:30.734 --> 02:33.066
OFFICIALLY DEAD FOREVER.

02:33.133 --> 02:34.667
AND THAT INCLUDES "WERPT," A

02:34.734 --> 02:35.433
TERM THAT DOESN'T EVEN EXIST,

02:35.500 --> 02:36.567
BUT WHICH I HAVE PREEMPTIVELY

02:36.633 --> 02:37.767
RUINED JUST IN CASE.

02:37.834 --> 02:39.200
REMEMBER, TEENS: DON'T LET

02:39.266 --> 02:40.633
WHITE MEN IN THEIR 40s HEAR THE

02:40.700 --> 02:42.266
COOL WORDS YOU USE.

02:42.333 --> 02:48.633
WE WILL BURY THEM.

02:48.700 --> 02:51.734
SO, LOOK, THE BIG QUESTION HERE

02:51.800 --> 02:52.300
IS, WHO IS GOING TO REPLACE

02:52.367 --> 02:52.567
KENNEDY?

02:52.633 --> 02:53.533
AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE

02:53.600 --> 02:55.567
THEIR PLANS PRETTY CLEAR, WITH

02:55.633 --> 02:56.433
MIKE PENCE TWEETING, "THANK YOU

02:56.500 --> 02:57.500
TO JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY FOR

02:57.567 --> 02:58.533
YOUR LONG CAREER OF SERVICE.

02:58.600 --> 02:59.834
TRUMP WILL NOMINATE A STRONG

02:59.900 --> 03:01.100
CONSERVATIVE IN THE TRADITION OF

03:01.166 --> 03:01.967
THE LATE JUSTICE SCALIA."

03:02.033 --> 03:03.166
WHICH IS A LITTLE WEIRD.

03:03.233 --> 03:04.200
YOU DON'T GENERALLY STAND UP AT

03:04.266 --> 03:07.533
SOMEONE'S RETIREMENT PARTY AND

03:07.600 --> 03:08.200
SAY, "THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING

03:08.266 --> 03:08.900
YOU DID FOR THIS COMPANY,

03:08.967 --> 03:10.266
ROBERT, AND REST ASSURED THAT WE

03:10.333 --> 03:10.867
WILL REPLACE YOU WITH SOMEONE

03:10.934 --> 03:11.900
EXACTLY LIKE THAT OTHER GUY WHO

03:11.967 --> 03:14.300
USED TO WORK HERE THAT WE ALWAYS

03:14.367 --> 03:15.333
LIKED MUCH MORE THAN YOU."

03:15.400 --> 03:16.467
AND TRUMP ALREADY HAS A LIST OF

03:16.533 --> 03:17.533
POTENTIAL NOMINEES ASSEMBLED

03:17.600 --> 03:18.467
WITH THE HELP OF THE

03:18.533 --> 03:19.567
CONSERVATIVE FEDERALIST SOCIETY,

03:19.633 --> 03:20.734
WHOSE VICE PRESIDENT SEEMS

03:20.800 --> 03:21.800
PRETTY CONFIDENT IN THEIR

03:21.867 --> 03:23.100
CHOICES.

03:23.166 --> 03:24.533
>> IS THERE A LEADING CONTENDER

03:24.600 --> 03:25.100
FOR YOU?

03:25.166 --> 03:25.767
>> NO, THERE'S NOT.

03:25.834 --> 03:26.767
>> REALLY NOT?

03:26.834 --> 03:27.633
>> NO.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.233
THE LIST IS REALLY GOOD.

03:29.300 --> 03:33.200
>> THEY'RE NOT IN ORDER?

03:33.266 --> 03:34.200
YOU'RE JUST SAYING --

03:34.266 --> 03:34.834
>> NO, NO, YOU CAN THROW A DART

03:34.900 --> 03:36.133
AT THAT LIST, AND IN MY VIEW,

03:36.200 --> 03:36.567
YOU'D BE FINE.

03:36.633 --> 03:37.433
>> John: WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK IN

03:37.500 --> 03:40.867
THAT ONE, BECAUSE THAT WILL

03:40.934 --> 03:41.767
THIS PRESIDENT'S ENTIRE

03:41.834 --> 03:42.867
DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.

03:42.934 --> 03:43.767
AND THERE IS A NON-ZERO CHANCE

03:43.834 --> 03:44.600
HE COULD JUST HIT MIKE PENCE AND

03:44.667 --> 03:47.000
CALL IT A DAY.

03:47.066 --> 03:48.200
AND GIVEN ALL OF THIS, IT'S

03:48.266 --> 03:49.300
UNDERSTANDABLE THAT DEMOCRATS

03:49.367 --> 03:50.967
ARE NOW DESPERATELY TRYING TO

03:51.033 --> 03:51.900
GAME OUT ARGUMENTS THAT WOULD

03:51.967 --> 03:52.433
LET THEM OBSTRUCT OR DELAY

03:52.500 --> 03:52.967
TRUMP'S NOMINATION.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.567
THEY'VE APPEALED TO

03:54.633 --> 03:55.533
MITCH McCONNELL'S SENSE OF

03:55.600 --> 03:56.767
FAIRNESS AND CONSISTENCY BY

03:56.834 --> 03:57.734
POINTING OUT THAT HE REFUSED TO

03:57.800 --> 03:58.800
CONFIRM MERRICK GARLAND BEFORE A

03:58.867 --> 03:59.767
MAJOR ELECTION.

03:59.834 --> 04:01.233
THE PROBLEM THERE IS THAT

04:01.300 --> 04:02.433
McCONNELL COULDN'T GIVE A

04:02.500 --> 04:03.767
FLYING FUCK ABOUT FAIRNESS OR

04:03.834 --> 04:07.300
CONSISTENCY, MEANING SOME

04:07.367 --> 04:08.667
DEMOCRATS HAVE NOW BEEN FORCED

04:08.734 --> 04:17.633
TO MOVE ON TO PLAN B.

04:17.700 --> 04:18.567
>> THE PRESIDENT OF THE

04:18.633 --> 04:19.533
UNITED STATES, RIGHT NOW, IS A

04:19.600 --> 04:21.533
SUBJECT OF AN ONGOING CRIMINAL

04:21.600 --> 04:22.800
INVESTIGATION, AN INVESTIGATION

04:22.867 --> 04:24.033
THAT EVERY MEMBER OF THIS

04:24.100 --> 04:25.667
COMMITTEE KNOWS COULD END UP

04:25.734 --> 04:26.300
BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT

04:26.367 --> 04:27.133
I BELIEVE THAT THIS COMMITTEE --

04:27.200 --> 04:27.934
DO NOT BELIEVE THIS COMMITTEE

04:28.000 --> 04:28.700
SHOULD OR CAN IN GOOD CONSCIENCE

04:28.767 --> 04:29.567
CONSIDER A NOMINEE PUT FORWARD

04:29.633 --> 04:30.400
BY THIS PRESIDENT UNTIL THAT

04:30.467 --> 04:31.700
INVESTIGATION IS CONCLUDED.

04:31.767 --> 04:32.800
>> John: OKAY, SO MERITS OF

04:32.867 --> 04:33.867
THAT ARGUMENT ASIDE, THERE'S A

04:33.934 --> 04:34.967
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM THERE, AND

04:35.033 --> 04:36.166
THAT IS THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE 51

04:36.233 --> 04:37.233
SEATS IN THE SENATE, AND THEY

04:37.300 --> 04:38.300
NEED 51 VOTES TO CONFIRM THE NEW

04:38.367 --> 04:39.400
JUSTICE.

04:39.467 --> 04:40.734
SO UNLESS DEMOCRATS CAN CONVINCE

04:40.800 --> 04:41.967
THEIR ENTIRE PARTY TO OPPOSE THE

04:42.033 --> 04:43.900
NOMINATION AND PERSUADE A NUMBER

04:43.967 --> 04:50.033
OF REPUBLICANS OVER TO THEIR

04:50.100 --> 04:50.967
SIDE, THEY ARE SHIT OUT OF LUCK,

04:51.033 --> 04:51.934
MEANING IT'S TIME FOR DEMOCRATS'

04:52.000 --> 04:52.500
FAVORITE GAME:

04:52.567 --> 04:53.266
"HOPE SUSAN COLLINS

04:53.333 --> 04:54.767
FLIPS AND BE DISAPPOINTED

04:54.834 --> 04:57.600
WHEN SHE DOESN'T!"

04:57.667 --> 04:58.200
IT'S AMERICA'S MOST DEPRESSING

04:58.266 --> 04:59.800
GAME SHOW.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.300
AND LOOK, THE CONSEQUENCES HERE

05:01.367 --> 05:04.467
WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE GRIM.

05:04.533 --> 05:06.433
JUST WATCH CNN LEGAL ANALYST

05:06.500 --> 05:08.834
JEFFREY TOOBIN SEEMINGLY VISIT

05:08.900 --> 05:10.567
EVERY SINGLE SHOW ON CNN TO DO

05:10.633 --> 05:11.800
WHATEVER THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF

05:11.867 --> 05:15.600
SUGARCOATING IS.

05:15.667 --> 05:17.400
>> ROE V. WADE IS DOOMED.

05:17.467 --> 05:18.734
IT IS GONE BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP

05:18.800 --> 05:20.533
WON THE ELECTION.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.433
ABORTION WILL BE ILLEGAL IN

05:22.500 --> 05:23.567
QUITE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE

05:23.633 --> 05:26.166
UNITED STATES SOON.

05:26.233 --> 05:27.533
ALL THIS FANTASY TALK ABOUT,

05:27.600 --> 05:29.834
"OH, I DON'T KNOW IF ROE V. WADE

05:29.900 --> 05:30.934
IS GOING TO BE OVERTURNED."

05:31.000 --> 05:31.834
OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO BE

05:31.900 --> 05:32.834
OVERTURNED.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.033
ROE V. WADE IS GOING TO

05:34.100 --> 05:35.066
DISAPPEAR.

05:35.133 --> 05:36.066
IT ARRIVED IN 1973 AND IT WILL

05:36.133 --> 05:37.600
DIE SHORTLY.

05:37.667 --> 05:39.467
>> JEFF, I HEARD YOU SAY EARLIER

05:39.533 --> 05:42.633
THAT, WITHIN 18 MONTHS, THAT

05:42.700 --> 05:44.033
ABORTION COULD BE ILLEGAL IN AS

05:44.100 --> 05:46.734
MANY AS 20 STATES.

05:46.800 --> 05:49.500
>> NO, I SAID ABORTION WILL BE

05:49.567 --> 05:50.400
ILLEGAL IN AS MANY AS 20 STATES.

05:50.467 --> 05:51.700
BECAUSE ROE V. WADE IS DEAD

05:51.767 --> 05:53.233
TODAY.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.567
>> John: WOW.

05:55.633 --> 05:57.467
I WOULD NOT WANT TO HEAR

05:57.533 --> 05:58.400
JEFFREY TOOBIN TELL HIS DAUGHTER

05:58.467 --> 05:59.166
THEIR DOG PASSED AWAY.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.467
"SWEETHEART, BAXTER WAS TAKEN TO

06:00.533 --> 06:01.600
A FARM UPSTATE.

06:01.667 --> 06:03.166
AND THEN SHOT IN THE FACE."

06:03.233 --> 06:04.300
HE'S DEAD NOW.

06:04.367 --> 06:08.834
HE'S DEAD.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.934
HE'S GOT NO FACE ANYMORE!

06:11.000 --> 06:12.767
BUT, I'M HAPPY TO SAY, THERE IS

06:12.834 --> 06:13.600
SOME GOOD NEWS.

06:13.667 --> 06:14.567
IT TURNS OUT THERE'S A

06:14.633 --> 06:15.567
CONSTITUTIONAL LOOPHOLE THAT

06:15.633 --> 06:17.600
ALLOWS DEMOCRATS TO --

06:17.667 --> 06:19.033
I'M OBVIOUSLY LYING HERE.

06:19.100 --> 06:21.266
THERE'S NO GOOD NEWS.

06:21.333 --> 06:23.834
EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLE NOW.

06:23.900 --> 06:24.967
AND, LOOK, BARRING SOME MASSIVE

06:25.033 --> 06:26.300
SCREWUP FROM TRUMP, THE ONLY

06:26.367 --> 06:26.900
THING ANYONE CAN REALLY DO IS

06:26.967 --> 06:27.867
VOTE.

06:27.934 --> 06:28.800
AND THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO KEY

06:28.867 --> 06:32.000
ELECTIONS YOU SHOULD REALLY TRY

06:32.066 --> 06:32.500
AND VOTE IN:

06:32.567 --> 06:35.500
ONE IN 2016 AND ONE IN 2014.

06:35.567 --> 06:36.266
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT GOT US INTO

06:36.333 --> 06:37.166
THIS MESS.

06:37.233 --> 06:38.200
SO I WANT YOU TO GO AND FIND A

06:38.266 --> 06:39.266
MEDIUM-SIZED CARDBOARD BOX RIGHT

06:39.333 --> 06:40.166
NOW.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.533
TAKE A PEN AND WRITE

06:41.600 --> 06:42.133
"TIME MACHINE" ON THE SIDE OF

06:42.200 --> 06:43.300
IT.

06:43.367 --> 06:44.233
NOT BECAUSE IT'LL TAKE YOU

06:44.300 --> 06:45.600
BACKWARDS IN TIME -- IT WON'T.

06:45.667 --> 06:46.233
IT'S A CARDBOARD BOX.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.533
BUT WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS

06:47.600 --> 06:48.667
SCREAM INTO IT.

06:48.734 --> 06:50.066
JUST EMPTY ALL THE ANGER AND

06:50.133 --> 06:51.400
FRUSTRATION THAT YOU'RE FEELING

10:47.500 --> 10:50.667

11:05.567 --> 11:06.633
YOU TO CUT OUT TEXT, CHANGE IT.

11:06.700 --> 11:07.600
THE CELL TAKES OVER AFTER THE --

11:07.667 --> 11:08.734
AFTER THE DNA IS BROKEN AND

11:08.800 --> 11:09.700
MAKES A PRECISE CHANGE AT THE

11:09.767 --> 11:10.600
SITE OF THE REPAIR.

11:10.667 --> 11:11.567

11:11.633 --> 11:12.967

11:13.033 --> 11:14.266

11:16.600 --> 11:17.767
STRAND OF DNA, WITH CRISPR, YOU

11:17.834 --> 11:20.500
COULD THEORETICALLY FIND IT, CUT

11:20.567 --> 11:23.266
IT OUT, AND PASTE IN A FIX, AT

11:23.333 --> 11:24.600
WHICH POINT, PRESUMABLY,

11:24.667 --> 11:25.533
CLIPPY SHOWS UP AND SAYS, "HI!

11:25.600 --> 11:26.400

11:31.300 --> 11:32.233
THERE ARE HOPES THAT IT MIGHT

11:32.300 --> 11:36.433
EVENTUALLY BE APPLIED TO MORE

11:36.500 --> 11:37.367

13:11.333 --> 13:12.433
SCIENTISTS ARE RESEARCHING WAYS

MICE.

13:15.700 --> 13:16.600
PAINSTAKINGLY SLOW THIS KIND OF

SO THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF ANIMALS

13:35.300 --> 13:36.567
THAT HAVE SINGLE HORNS IN THE

13:41.400 --> 13:42.533
IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HEAD, SO

13:42.600 --> 13:43.934
ANYWAY, I THINK THAT YOU COULD

13:44.000 --> 13:46.900
GET A SINGLE HORN ON A HORSE BY

13:46.967 --> 13:49.233
LOOKING AT HORNS IN OTHER

13:49.300 --> 13:51.633
SPECIES.

13:51.700 --> 13:52.734
>> SO IT'S IN THE REALM OF

13:52.800 --> 13:53.734
POSSIBILITY.

13:53.800 --> 13:59.033
>> YES.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.433
>> John: SO I'VE GOT TO SAY,

14:00.500 --> 14:01.533
JUDGING BY ALL THE HEDGING HE

14:01.600 --> 14:03.300
DID IN THAT ANSWER, EVEN IF WE

14:03.367 --> 14:04.200
DO ONE DAY CREATE A UNICORN,

14:04.266 --> 14:06.533
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THIS

14:06.600 --> 14:07.433
MAJESTIC CREATURE WHO WANTS YOU

14:07.500 --> 14:08.266
TO FOLLOW IT TO A MAGIC

14:08.333 --> 14:09.166
WATERFALL.

14:09.233 --> 14:10.300
IT'LL BE MORE LIKE THIS, A

14:10.367 --> 14:11.600
MONSTER THAT WOULD BEG,

14:11.667 --> 14:13.133
"PLEASE KILL ME, END THIS.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.900
END THIS MADNESS NOW."

14:15.967 --> 14:17.433
IN FACT, FOR A GOOD SENSE OF THE

14:17.500 --> 14:18.800
MISMATCH BETWEEN EXPECTATION AND

14:18.867 --> 14:22.400
CURRENT CAPABILITIES, JUST LOOK

14:22.467 --> 14:23.633
AT A PROJECT THAT THAT SCIENTIST

14:23.700 --> 14:24.400
IS WORKING ON RIGHT NOW:

14:24.467 --> 14:27.300
BRINGING BACK THE WOOLY MAMMOTH.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.600
IT HAS BEEN HYPED IN HEADLINES

14:28.667 --> 14:29.567
ALL OVER THE WORLD, BUT THEY'RE

14:29.633 --> 14:30.300
NOWHERE CLOSE TO CREATING A

14:30.367 --> 14:31.367
LIVING ANIMAL YET, AND EVEN

14:31.433 --> 14:32.467
COMPUTER SIMULATIONS ARE

14:32.533 --> 14:34.200
UNDERWHELMING.

14:34.266 --> 14:36.767
>> IN THE LAB, THEY'VE EDITED

14:36.834 --> 14:39.200
ABOUT 35 FUNCTIONING

14:39.266 --> 14:40.367
WOOLY MAMMOTH GENES INTO THE

14:40.433 --> 14:42.200
ASIAN ELEPHANT GENOME.

14:42.266 --> 14:43.567
THIS IS A GOOD START FOR MAKING

14:43.633 --> 14:54.900
A SEMI-WOOLY MAMMOTH.

14:54.967 --> 14:55.633
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S NOT A

14:55.700 --> 14:56.300
WOOLY MAMMOTH THOUGH.

14:56.367 --> 14:57.333
THAT'S JUST A WRONG ELEPHANT.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.266
IT'S NOT SO MUCH "JURASSIC PARK"

14:58.333 --> 14:59.233
AS AN OFF-BRAND $3 PETTING ZOO

14:59.300 --> 15:00.200
CALLED "PET THE WHATEVER."

15:00.266 --> 15:00.800
BUT IF YOU WATCH THE NEWS, YOU

15:00.867 --> 15:01.834
MAY'VE NOTICED THAT YOU'RE NOT

15:01.900 --> 15:02.934
JUST SEEING PROFESSIONAL

15:03.000 --> 15:04.200
SCIENTISTS, AND THAT'S BECAUSE

15:04.266 --> 15:05.633
THE UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY OF

15:05.700 --> 15:06.667
CRISPR IS SO CHEAP AND WIDELY

15:06.734 --> 15:07.767
AVAILABLE, ALMOST ANYONE CAN USE

15:07.834 --> 15:09.633
IT.

15:09.700 --> 15:10.934
SO GENE EDITING STORIES ALMOST

15:11.000 --> 15:12.500
ALWAYS FEATURE A DETOUR TO MEET

15:12.567 --> 15:15.266
BIOHACKERS LIKE JOSIAH ZAYNER.

15:15.333 --> 15:17.200
>> HERE IN THE BAY AREA, WE'RE

15:17.266 --> 15:19.066
VISITING A BIOHACKER IN HIS

15:19.133 --> 15:20.367
GARAGE.

15:20.433 --> 15:21.400
HE'S SELLING CRISPR KITS, DIY

15:21.467 --> 15:22.633
CRISPR KITS, FOR A COUPLE OF

15:22.700 --> 15:25.467
HUNDRED DOLLARS.

15:25.533 --> 15:26.800
>> YOU CAN BUY THIS CUTTING-EDGE

15:26.867 --> 15:27.934
KIT THAT ALLOWS YOU TO USE THIS

15:28.000 --> 15:29.633
TECHNOLOGY AND YOU DON'T NEED

15:29.700 --> 15:34.767
ANYTHING ELSE.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.100
YOU DON'T NEED A PhD, AND YOU

15:36.166 --> 15:37.266
COULD DO EXPERIMENTS WITH

15:37.333 --> 15:38.200
CRISPR.

15:38.266 --> 15:39.900
LIKE, THAT I THINK IS --

15:39.967 --> 15:41.000
IS REALLY COOL.

15:41.066 --> 15:41.967
>> John: OKAY, THAT SOUNDS

15:42.033 --> 15:42.900
REVOLUTIONARY, BUT TO BE FAIR,

15:42.967 --> 15:44.100
SELLING STRANGERS THINGS COVERED

15:44.166 --> 15:45.567
IN UNFAMILIAR DNA OUT OF YOUR

15:45.633 --> 15:46.900
GARAGE ALREADY HAS A NAME, AND

15:46.967 --> 15:48.300
IT'S "EVERY SINGLE GARAGE SALE

15:48.367 --> 15:50.300
IN HUMAN HISTORY."

15:50.367 --> 15:52.934
"I WOULD LIKE TO BUY YOUR LAMP,

15:53.000 --> 15:54.467
PLEASE, AND THEN I AM GOING TO

15:54.533 --> 15:55.600
TAKE IT HOME AND WASH IT."

15:55.667 --> 15:57.166
AND LOOK, HE'S BASICALLY SELLING

15:57.233 --> 15:59.500
CHEMISTRY SETS, AND TO THE

15:59.567 --> 16:00.867
EXTENT THAT THEY GET PEOPLE

16:00.934 --> 16:02.233
EXCITED ABOUT SCIENCE, THAT'S A

16:02.300 --> 16:03.166
GOOD THING.

16:03.233 --> 16:04.133
BUT YOU CAN SEE WHY SCIENTISTS

16:04.200 --> 16:05.500
GET FRUSTRATED WHEN BIOHACKERS

16:05.567 --> 16:06.800
LIKE ZAYNER HOG ALL THE MEDIA

16:06.867 --> 16:08.200
ATTENTION, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE HE

16:08.266 --> 16:09.934
MAKES SOME PRETTY WILD

16:10.000 --> 16:10.834
STATEMENTS, LIKE "I WANT TO LIVE

16:10.900 --> 16:12.533
IN A WORLD WHERE PEOPLE GET

16:12.600 --> 16:13.533
DRUNK AND INSTEAD OF GIVING

16:13.600 --> 16:14.433
THEMSELVES TATTOOS, THEY'RE

16:14.500 --> 16:15.900
LIKE, "I'M DRUNK, I'M GOING TO

16:15.967 --> 16:17.734
CRISPR MYSELF."

16:17.800 --> 16:20.266
WHICH IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.

16:20.333 --> 16:22.100
HONESTLY, YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN GET

16:22.166 --> 16:24.300
DRUNK AND TATTOO YOURSELF,

16:24.367 --> 16:25.633
HOWEVER COOL ROBERT DUVALL'S

16:25.700 --> 16:26.567
FACE COVERING YOUR MIDRIFF SEEMS

16:26.633 --> 16:28.300
AT THE TIME.

16:28.367 --> 16:29.400
I'M JUST SAYING, I HAVE SOME

16:29.467 --> 16:32.233
REGRETS.

16:32.300 --> 16:33.667
NOW, LAST OCTOBER, ZAYNER EVEN

16:33.734 --> 16:35.133
PUBLICLY INJECTED HIMSELF WITH

16:35.200 --> 16:36.467
DNA THAT HAD BEEN MODIFIED USING

16:36.533 --> 16:40.100
CRISPR TO TRY AND GIVE HIMSELF

16:40.166 --> 16:40.967
BIGGER MUSCLES, WHICH DID NOT

16:41.033 --> 16:42.000
WORK.

16:42.066 --> 16:42.900
BUT IN THAT SAME VIDEO, HE

16:42.967 --> 16:44.467
ARGUED THAT USING CRISPR SHOULD

16:44.533 --> 16:46.300
IDEALLY BE LIKE DOWNLOADING AN

16:46.367 --> 16:47.400
APP.

16:47.467 --> 16:48.734
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW WHAT

16:48.800 --> 16:49.633
THE APP DOES, HOW TO PROGRAM IT,

16:49.700 --> 16:50.767
HOW IT WORKS, ANYTHING LIKE

16:50.834 --> 16:52.066
THAT.

16:52.133 --> 16:53.000
AND I THINK THAT'S THE WAY IT

16:53.066 --> 16:54.166
SHOULD BE WITH GENETIC

16:54.233 --> 16:55.667
ENGINEERING AND SYNTHETIC

16:55.734 --> 16:56.900
BIOLOGY.

16:56.967 --> 16:58.266
WHY CAN'T PEOPLE USE THIS

16:58.333 --> 17:00.000
TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT NECESSARILY

17:00.066 --> 17:09.900
COMPLETELY KNOWING HOW IT WORKS?

17:09.967 --> 17:10.633
>> John: OH, OH, I CAN ANSWER

17:10.700 --> 17:11.300
THAT ONE FOR YOU.

17:11.367 --> 17:12.133
BECAUSE IT COULD BE DANGEROUS

17:12.200 --> 17:12.800
AND SOMEONE COULD GET HURT.

17:12.867 --> 17:13.567
ALSO, I REFUSE TO TAKE

17:13.633 --> 17:14.900
SCIENTIFIC INSIGHTS FROM SOMEONE

17:15.000 --> 17:15.700
SHOOTING VERTICAL FOOTAGE ON AN

17:15.767 --> 17:17.033
iPHONE.

17:17.100 --> 17:23.834
THAT IS UNFORGIVABLE.

17:23.900 --> 17:25.033
THAT IS DISQUALIFYING

17:25.100 --> 17:25.633
IMMEDIATELY.

17:25.700 --> 17:26.800
AND THOUGH ZAYNER NOW SAYS HE

17:26.867 --> 17:28.333
REGRETS THAT EXPERIMENT, THAT

17:28.400 --> 17:29.200
KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS A REAL WORRY

17:29.266 --> 17:30.133
FOR SERIOUS SCIENTISTS --

17:30.200 --> 17:31.367
NOT JUST THAT A BIOHACKER WILL

17:31.433 --> 17:32.467
HURT THEMSELVES, BUT THAT

17:32.533 --> 17:33.567
DOCTORS OR SCIENTISTS MIGHT RUSH

17:33.633 --> 17:34.500
A HUMAN APPLICATION BEFORE IT'S

17:34.567 --> 17:35.700
READY, THINGS GO WRONG, AND THE

17:35.767 --> 17:37.533
WHOLE FIELD IS THEN SET BACK

17:37.600 --> 17:40.433
YEARS.

17:40.500 --> 17:41.233
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO

17:41.300 --> 17:42.233
THE FIELD OF GENE THERAPY WHEN A

17:42.300 --> 17:43.300
PATIENT NAMED JESSE GELSINGER

17:43.367 --> 17:44.300
DIED DURING A POORLY-DESIGNED

17:44.367 --> 17:45.333
TRIAL.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.533
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING

17:46.600 --> 17:47.667
SCIENTISTS WORRY ABOUT, BECAUSE

17:47.734 --> 17:49.400
THE BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS OF

17:49.467 --> 17:51.066
GENE EDITING CAN EXTEND WELL

17:51.133 --> 17:52.333
BEYOND ONE PERSON, AND TO

17:52.400 --> 17:54.367
UNDERSTAND WHY, IT HELPS TO BE

17:54.433 --> 17:56.300
FAMILIAR WITH A KEY DISTINCTION.

17:56.367 --> 17:57.700
>> SOMATIC CELLS ARE MOST OF THE

17:57.767 --> 17:59.100
CELLS IN THE BODY -- BLOOD,

17:59.166 --> 18:00.200
BRAIN, SKIN CELLS -- WHERE THE

18:00.266 --> 18:01.633
DNA DOESN'T GET PASSED DOWN TO

18:01.700 --> 18:03.667
OFFSPRING.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.266
GERM LINE EDITS INVOLVE SPERM,

18:05.333 --> 18:06.533
EGGS, OR EMBRYOS, BASICALLY

18:06.600 --> 18:08.200
CHANGING THE DNA OF FUTURE

18:08.266 --> 18:14.166
GENERATIONS.

18:14.233 --> 18:17.500
>> John: EXACTLY.

18:17.567 --> 18:19.333
SOMATIC CELLS DIE WITH YOU;

18:19.400 --> 18:20.300
GERM LINE CELLS GET PASSED DOWN.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.100
SO MUCH OF WHAT YOU'VE SEEN SO

18:21.166 --> 18:21.834
FAR, LIKE BABY LAYLA AND

18:21.900 --> 18:22.967
ZAYNER'S MUSCLE EXPERIMENT,

18:23.033 --> 18:23.567
INVOLVED SOMATIC CELLS, WHILE

18:23.633 --> 18:24.967
GERM LINE CELLS ARE HOW MY

18:25.033 --> 18:26.033
GREAT-GRANDFATHER PASSED THIS

18:26.100 --> 18:29.367
NOSE DOWN TO ME

18:29.433 --> 18:30.867
WHEN HE FUCKED THIS BIRD,

18:30.934 --> 18:31.800
GREAT-GRANDMA FEATHERS.

18:31.867 --> 18:34.700
SHE LOVED BELLS.

18:34.767 --> 18:36.934
GERM LINE EDITING COULD

18:37.000 --> 18:37.767
POTENTIALLY DO INCREDIBLE

18:37.834 --> 18:39.500
THINGS.

18:39.567 --> 18:40.500
TAKE MALARIA: NEARLY HALF A

18:40.567 --> 18:41.900
MILLION PEOPLE EACH YEAR DIE

18:41.967 --> 18:43.066
FROM IT, AND IT'S SPREAD BY

18:43.133 --> 18:44.166
MOSQUITOS, BUT GENE EDITING

18:44.233 --> 18:45.800
COULD HELP STOP THAT THROUGH

18:45.867 --> 18:47.233
SOMETHING CALLED A "GENE DRIVE."

18:47.300 --> 18:48.767
>> SCIENTISTS DO THIS BY

18:48.834 --> 18:50.667
INSERTING AN ARTIFICIAL GENE

18:50.734 --> 18:53.800
INTO THE DNA OF MOSQUITO EMBRYOS

18:53.867 --> 18:55.900
THAT WILL MAKE AN INCREASING

18:55.967 --> 18:57.600
PROPORTION OF FEMALE OFFSPRING

18:57.667 --> 19:00.100
STERILE.

19:00.166 --> 19:02.333
THE GENE DRIVE IS EMBEDDED IN

19:02.400 --> 19:03.934
THE DNA TO ENSURE THE CHANGES

19:04.000 --> 19:05.133
ARE INHERITED, UNLIKE NATURAL

19:05.200 --> 19:06.467
EVOLUTION WHERE CHANCE IS

19:06.533 --> 19:08.300
INVOLVED.

19:08.367 --> 19:09.867
>> John: THAT'S BRILLIANT.

19:09.934 --> 19:11.266
AND IT'S HONESTLY MUCH SIMPLER

19:11.333 --> 19:12.567
THAN MY IDEA TO FIGHT MALARIA BY

19:12.633 --> 19:14.133
JUST FITTING MILLIONS OF

19:14.200 --> 19:17.266
MOSQUITOES WITH TINY CONDOMS.

19:17.333 --> 19:19.100
BUT THE MOMENT YOU CROSS INTO

19:19.166 --> 19:23.400
GERM LINE EDITING, THE

19:23.467 --> 19:25.533
RAMIFICATIONS CAN SERIOUSLY

19:25.600 --> 19:26.867
INCREASE, BECAUSE MESSING WITH

19:26.934 --> 19:28.166
ANY ECOSYSTEM CAN HAVE

19:28.233 --> 19:28.834
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

19:28.900 --> 19:29.767
THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN TRUE, EVEN

19:29.834 --> 19:30.700
BEFORE GENE EDITING, AND MY

19:30.767 --> 19:32.000
FAVORITE EXAMPLE COMES FROM

19:32.066 --> 19:32.934
AUSTRALIA, WHERE ABOUT 100

19:33.000 --> 19:36.066
CANE TOADS WERE INTRODUCED IN

19:36.133 --> 19:36.934
THE 1930s TO CONTROL THE

19:37.000 --> 19:41.266
CANE BEETLE.

19:41.333 --> 19:41.867
FOR THE RECORD, THEY DIDN'T DO

19:41.934 --> 19:42.533
THAT.

19:42.600 --> 19:43.300
WHAT THEY DID DO WAS MULTIPLY TO

19:43.367 --> 19:44.233
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF TOADS

19:44.300 --> 19:48.033
AND WREAK HAVOC.

19:48.100 --> 19:48.700
AUSTRALIANS HATE THESE THINGS.

19:48.767 --> 19:49.533
THERE WAS EVEN A DOCUMENTARY

19:49.600 --> 19:50.367
MADE ABOUT THEM FEATURING A GUY

19:50.433 --> 19:51.233
WHO MADE IT HIS LIFE'S WORK TO

19:51.300 --> 19:52.734
RUN OVER AS MANY AS HE COULD.

19:52.800 --> 19:53.900
>> WELL, I LINE THEM UP WITH THE

19:53.967 --> 19:55.767
DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT WHEEL.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.166
I SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GET MOST OF

19:57.233 --> 19:59.667
THE ONES I LINE UP ON THE

19:59.734 --> 20:01.133
RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE ROAD.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.700
WELL, I REALLY GO OUT OF MY WAY

20:02.767 --> 20:05.000
TO RUN OVER CANE TOADS BASICALLY

20:05.066 --> 20:06.000
BECAUSE I HAVE A VERY PROFOUND

20:06.066 --> 20:07.233
LOVE OF THE WILDLIFE THAT OCCURS

20:07.300 --> 20:09.033
HERE NATURALLY.

20:09.100 --> 20:10.433
IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO REMOVE

20:10.500 --> 20:12.266
THEM AND TOTALLY ERADICATE THEM

20:12.333 --> 20:13.200
FROM AUSTRALIA, AND I WAS

20:13.266 --> 20:14.266
CAPABLE OF DOING IT, I WOULD

20:14.333 --> 20:15.500
SPEND A LOT OF TIME DOING

20:15.567 --> 20:19.300
EXACTLY THAT.

20:19.367 --> 20:21.834
>> John: WOW.

20:21.900 --> 20:23.066
THAT GUY IS IN FOR AN UNPLEASANT

20:23.133 --> 20:26.767
SURPRISE WHEN HE GETS TO THE

20:26.834 --> 20:28.200
PEARLY GATES AND FINDS OUT THAT

20:28.266 --> 20:30.033
GOD IS AN AUSTRALIAN CANE TOAD.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.000
"OH, SO YOU'D LIKE TO GET INTO

20:31.066 --> 20:32.367
HEAVEN, HUH?

20:32.433 --> 20:33.800
WHY DON'T WE GO AHEAD AND TAKE A

20:33.867 --> 20:35.667
LOOK AT THE TAPES."

20:35.734 --> 20:37.467
THE POINT IS, ECOSYSTEMS ARE

20:37.533 --> 20:41.433
VERY DELICATE, WHICH IS WHY YOU

20:41.500 --> 20:43.233
NEED TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL,

20:43.300 --> 20:44.233
AND A GOOD EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE

20:44.300 --> 20:45.400
TAKING THAT SORT OF CARE WITH

20:45.467 --> 20:46.800
GENE EDITING CAN BE SEEN IN A

20:46.867 --> 20:48.367
PROJECT BEING CONSIDERED ON

20:48.433 --> 20:48.934
NANTUCKET ISLAND AS A WAY TO

20:49.000 --> 20:49.367
FIGHT LYME DISEASE.

20:49.433 --> 20:50.200
YOU SEE, LYME DISEASE IS PASSED

20:50.266 --> 20:51.066
FROM TICKS TO HUMANS, BUT BEFORE

20:51.133 --> 20:52.266
THAT CAN HAPPEN, IT GOES FROM

20:52.333 --> 20:53.400
MICE TO TICKS.

20:53.467 --> 20:54.800
NOW, TYPICALLY, THE WAY THAT

20:54.867 --> 20:55.533
WORKS IS LIKE THIS:

20:55.600 --> 20:56.500
A MOUSE GOES THROUGH A TOUGH

20:56.567 --> 20:57.934
BREAKUP.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.033
IT WAS A RELATIONSHIP THE MOUSE

20:59.100 --> 20:59.934
DIDN'T WANT TO END AND LEAVES IT

21:00.000 --> 21:00.834
SERIOUSLY QUESTIONING ITS

21:00.900 --> 21:02.266
SELF-WORTH.

21:02.333 --> 21:03.266
THE MOUSE GOES ON A SERIES OF

21:03.333 --> 21:04.300
REBOUND DATES THAT ONLY DEEPEN

21:04.367 --> 21:05.700
THE DISILLUSIONMENT.

21:05.767 --> 21:06.533
"COULD ANYONE LOVE ME?"

21:06.600 --> 21:08.000
THE MOUSE WONDERS.

21:08.066 --> 21:09.200
DESPONDENT, THE MOUSE TURNS TO

21:09.266 --> 21:10.667
ALCOHOL TO NUMB THE PAIN.

21:10.734 --> 21:11.800
WHILE DRUNK, IT COMES ACROSS A

21:11.867 --> 21:13.200
TINDER PROFILE OF A TICK.

21:13.266 --> 21:14.867
AT FIRST, THE MOUSE IS

21:14.934 --> 21:16.066
DISGUSTED, BUT THEN IT'S

21:16.133 --> 21:17.133
ACTUALLY INTRIGUED.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.367
"OH, GOD," IT THINKS, "AM I

21:18.433 --> 21:20.266
REALLY GOING TO FUCK A TICK?"

21:20.333 --> 21:21.500
THE MOUSE GOES ON THE DATE

21:21.567 --> 21:22.633
THINKING, "IT'S JUST A DATE,

21:22.700 --> 21:24.166
WE'RE JUST TALKING."

21:24.233 --> 21:24.734
BUT THE MOUSE IS LYING TO

21:24.800 --> 21:26.300
ITSELF, 'CAUSE AS SOON AS THE

21:26.367 --> 21:27.467
TICK SAYS, "MAYBE WE SHOULD GO

21:27.533 --> 21:28.667
SOME PLACE QUIET WHERE WE CAN

21:28.734 --> 21:30.367
TALK," BAM, THEY'RE BANGING IN

21:30.433 --> 21:34.567
THE SHOWER.

21:34.633 --> 21:35.367
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:35.433 --> 21:36.100
AFTERWARDS, THE MOUSE FEELS

21:36.166 --> 21:36.967
STRANGELY SATISFIED.

21:37.033 --> 21:37.633
IT FEELS DESIRABLE AGAIN.

21:37.700 --> 21:38.633
AS FOR THE TICK, IT CAN'T WAIT

21:38.700 --> 21:40.133
TO BRAG TO ITS FRIENDS THAT IT

21:40.200 --> 21:47.000
JUST FUCKED A MOUSE.

21:47.066 --> 21:48.200
AND THEY BOTH FORGET ABOUT

21:48.266 --> 21:49.967
THE ENCOUNTER UNTIL EIGHT MONTHS

21:50.033 --> 21:53.367
LATER, WHEN THE TICK GETS A

21:53.433 --> 21:54.266
CALL: BAD NEWS, YOU'VE GOT

21:54.333 --> 21:55.200
LYME DISEASE.

21:55.266 --> 21:56.100
AND THAT IS HOW LYME DISEASE

21:56.166 --> 21:57.200
SPREADS FROM MICE TO TICKS.

21:57.266 --> 21:57.633
SOMETIMES.

21:57.700 --> 21:58.467
OTHER TIMES, THE TICK BITES THE

21:58.533 --> 21:59.333
MOUSE.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.266
THE POINT IS, TO PREVENT THE

22:00.333 --> 22:01.166
SPREAD OF LYME DISEASE, A

22:01.233 --> 22:02.166
BIOLOGIST NAMED KEVIN ESVELT IS

22:02.233 --> 22:04.567
CONSIDERING INTRODUCING

22:04.633 --> 22:05.500
GENETICALLY EDITED MICE THAT

22:05.567 --> 22:06.400
CANNOT PASS THE DISEASE TO

22:06.467 --> 22:07.166
TICKS.

22:07.233 --> 22:07.900
AND HE WOULD DO THIS WITH A TON

22:07.967 --> 22:08.700
OF CAUTION, TESTING IT ON AN

22:08.767 --> 22:09.834
UNINHABITED ISLAND WHERE THE

22:09.900 --> 22:12.900
EXPERIMENT WILL BE CONTAINED,

22:12.967 --> 22:15.467
AND IT WOULD ONLY GO FORWARD ON

22:15.533 --> 22:16.266
NANTUCKET IF HE GOT THE BUY-IN

22:16.333 --> 22:17.400
OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY.

22:17.467 --> 22:18.333
AND EVEN WITH ALL THOSE

22:18.400 --> 22:18.934
SAFEGUARDS, HE'S AWARE OF THE

22:19.000 --> 22:20.066
UNCERTAINTY.

22:20.133 --> 22:20.900
>> ALTHOUGH KEVIN ESVELT IS

22:20.967 --> 22:22.333
CONFIDENT HIS ENGINEERED MICE

22:22.400 --> 22:24.000
WILL ONLY REDUCE LYME DISEASE

22:24.066 --> 22:25.500
AND NOT BRING HARM TO

22:25.567 --> 22:28.834
NANTUCKET'S ECOSYSTEM, HE ALSO

22:28.900 --> 22:30.633
KNOWS THAT ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY

22:30.700 --> 22:32.467
AND GENETIC ENGINEERING DO NOT

22:32.533 --> 22:35.467
GO TOGETHER.

22:35.533 --> 22:37.900
>> I WORRY EVERY DAY THAT I

22:37.967 --> 22:39.533
MIGHT BE MISSING SOMETHING

22:39.600 --> 22:40.500
PROFOUND ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES

22:40.567 --> 22:41.834
OF WHAT WE'RE DEVELOPING.

22:41.900 --> 22:43.100
>> John: GOOD!

22:43.166 --> 22:43.967
I'M GLAD YOU DO.

22:44.033 --> 22:44.867
BECAUSE THAT IS THE KIND OF

22:44.934 --> 22:46.533
CAUTION YOU WANT FROM SOMEONE IN

22:46.600 --> 22:48.233
HIS POSITION.

22:48.300 --> 22:49.500
HE CLEARLY DOESN'T WANT TO END

22:49.567 --> 22:51.166
UP IN A LIMERICK THAT GOES,

22:51.233 --> 22:51.633
"THERE ONCE WAS A MAN

22:51.700 --> 22:52.767
FROM NANTUCKET

22:52.834 --> 22:53.633
WHO GATHERED SOME MICE

22:53.700 --> 22:54.000
IN A BUCKET.

22:54.066 --> 22:54.667
HE ALTERED THOSE MICE

22:54.734 --> 22:55.400
ENGINEERED WITH A SPLICE

22:55.467 --> 22:56.300
AND NOW ALL OF THE SEAGULLS

22:56.367 --> 23:04.233
ARE DEAD."

23:04.300 --> 23:05.734
AND, LOOK, THERE AREN'T JUST

23:05.800 --> 23:07.400
PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS TO GERM

23:07.467 --> 23:08.133
LINE EDITING.

23:08.200 --> 23:08.900
THERE ARE HUGE MORAL QUESTIONS

23:08.967 --> 23:09.633
TOO, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES

23:09.700 --> 23:10.500
TO HUMANS, BECAUSE IT RAISES THE

23:10.567 --> 23:12.567
POSSIBILITY THAT GENE EDITING

23:12.633 --> 23:14.066
COULD ONE DAY BE USED NOT JUST

23:14.133 --> 23:15.533
TO FIGHT DISEASE, BUT FOR

23:15.600 --> 23:16.567
SO-CALLED ENHANCEMENT, WHICH

23:16.633 --> 23:18.266
SAILS YOU INTO SOME PRETTY DICEY

23:18.333 --> 23:21.066
TERRITORY.

23:21.133 --> 23:22.166
EVEN JENNIFER DOUDNA, ONE OF THE

23:22.233 --> 23:23.567
PIONEERS OF CRISPR, SEES THE

23:23.633 --> 23:25.934
DANGER.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.967
HERE SHE IS TELLING THE STORY OF

23:29.033 --> 23:30.233
A DREAM THAT SHE ONCE HAD THAT

23:30.300 --> 23:31.600
WAS PRETTY ON-THE-NOSE.

23:31.667 --> 23:33.467
>> I WALKED INTO A ROOM AND A

23:33.533 --> 23:35.100
COLLEAGUE OF MINE SAID TO ME,

23:35.166 --> 23:37.934
"JENNIFER, I'D LIKE YOU TO

23:38.000 --> 23:39.333
EXPLAIN THE CRISPR TECHNOLOGY TO

23:39.400 --> 23:41.033
A FRIEND."

23:41.100 --> 23:42.300
AND HE BROUGHT ME INTO A ROOM,

23:42.367 --> 23:44.433
AND A PERSON WAS SITTING WITH

23:44.500 --> 23:46.934
THEIR BACK TO ME.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.367
AND AS THEY TURNED AROUND, I

23:48.433 --> 23:50.533
REALIZED WITH SORT OF A HORROR

23:50.600 --> 23:53.567
THAT IT WAS -- IT WAS HITLER.

23:53.633 --> 23:54.800
IT WAS ACTUALLY HITLER WITH SORT

23:54.867 --> 23:56.734
OF A PIG NOSE.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.266
IT LOOKED ALMOST LIKE A CHIMERIC

23:58.333 --> 24:01.500
PIG/HUMAN SORT OF CREATURE.

24:01.567 --> 24:03.100
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

24:03.166 --> 24:05.266
SHE HAD A DREAM ABOUT PIG HITLER

24:05.333 --> 24:06.300
WANTING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT

24:06.367 --> 24:07.467
CRISPR.

24:07.533 --> 24:08.967
AND ETHICAL RESERVATIONS ASIDE,

24:09.033 --> 24:10.066
SHE MIGHT ALSO WANT TO EXAMINE

24:10.133 --> 24:11.400
WHY HER SUBCONSCIOUS THINKS ONE

24:11.467 --> 24:13.433
OF HER COLLEAGUES IS JUST

24:13.500 --> 24:15.567
CASUALLY FRIENDS WITH HITLER.

24:15.633 --> 24:16.934
AND LOOK, LOOK, CLEARLY, THE

24:17.000 --> 24:18.667
MORE CONTROL PEOPLE HAVE OVER

24:18.734 --> 24:20.834
THE ABILITY TO DESIGN THEIR

24:20.900 --> 24:21.667
CHILDREN, THE BIGGER THE MORAL

24:21.734 --> 24:24.000
QUESTIONS THAT RAISES, UP TO AND

24:24.066 --> 24:24.734
INCLUDING WHO DECIDES WHAT

24:24.800 --> 24:26.033
CONSTITUTES A GENETIC PROBLEM

24:26.100 --> 24:29.433
THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.

24:29.500 --> 24:31.633
>> IS DEAFNESS A DISEASE?

24:31.700 --> 24:32.400
MANY IN THE DEAF COMMUNITY WOULD

24:32.467 --> 24:33.934
SAY IT IS NOT.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.033
IS DWARFISM A DISEASE?

24:35.100 --> 24:36.800
MANY WOULD SAY NOT.

24:36.867 --> 24:39.133
>> THE IDEA THAT WE'RE ALL SICK,

24:39.200 --> 24:39.934
THAT WE'RE SUFFERING, THAT I

24:40.000 --> 24:41.100
SUFFER FROM DWARFISM --

24:41.166 --> 24:42.200
NO, I LIVE WITH DWARFISM.

24:42.266 --> 24:43.767
I'VE LIVED WITH DWARFISM FOR

24:43.834 --> 24:46.133
39 YEARS.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.867
I'M PROUD TO BE A

24:47.934 --> 24:49.300
SECOND GENERATION RAISING A

24:49.367 --> 24:50.734
THIRD GENERATION OF PEOPLE

24:50.800 --> 24:53.000
LIVING WITH DWARFISM.

24:53.066 --> 24:53.800
I DON'T SUFFER.

24:53.867 --> 24:54.633
I SUFFER FROM HOW SOCIETY TREATS

24:54.700 --> 24:55.500
ME.

24:55.567 --> 24:56.367
>> John: EXACTLY.

24:56.433 --> 24:57.133
THERE ARE MANY GROUPS WHO COULD

24:57.200 --> 24:58.133
JUSTIFIABLY WORRY THAT THE THING

24:58.200 --> 24:59.133
THAT MAKES THEM UNIQUE OR

24:59.200 --> 25:00.367
DIFFERENT COULD COME TO BE SEEN

25:00.433 --> 25:02.600
AS FLAWS TO BE CORRECTED.

25:02.667 --> 25:03.800
AND "EUGENICS" IS A WORD THAT

25:03.867 --> 25:06.934
RIGHTLY TERRIFIES PEOPLE.

25:07.000 --> 25:07.934
IT'S WHY IT WAS SUCH A MISTAKE

25:08.000 --> 25:09.133
FOR EUGENE LEVY TO MAKE THAT THE

25:09.200 --> 25:10.467
TITLE OF HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY.

25:10.533 --> 25:11.533
IT'S A SHAME.

25:11.600 --> 25:15.967
IT'S A SHAME.

25:16.033 --> 25:16.900
IT WAS A LOVELY BOOK.

25:16.967 --> 25:17.734
HE HAD SOME GREAT

25:17.800 --> 25:18.467
CATHERINE O'HARA ANECDOTES.

25:18.533 --> 25:19.533
BUT THAT TITLE REALLY DUSTED YOU

25:19.600 --> 25:20.633
OFF.

25:20.700 --> 25:22.800
NOW, HERE'S THE THING:

25:22.867 --> 25:24.000
GERM LINE-EDITED CRISPR BABIES

25:24.066 --> 25:25.033
ARE STILL A DISTANT

25:25.100 --> 25:26.800
HYPOTHETICAL.

25:26.867 --> 25:28.066
NO HUMAN HAS BEEN BORN THAT HAS

25:28.133 --> 25:28.900
HAD ITS GERM LINE EDITED YET,

25:28.967 --> 25:29.967
AND MANY COUNTRIES HAVE BANS OR

25:30.033 --> 25:31.100
RESTRICTIONS ON THAT.

25:31.166 --> 25:32.934
BUT ONE PLACE WITH VERY FEW

25:33.000 --> 25:34.467
RESTRICTIONS IS CHINA, WHICH IN

25:34.533 --> 25:36.233
GENERAL SEEMS EAGER TO PUSH THE

25:36.300 --> 25:37.834
LIMITS OF GENE EDITING, AND ONE

25:37.900 --> 25:39.467
OF THE SCIENTISTS WORKING AT

25:39.533 --> 25:41.033
THAT JACKED BEAGLE LAB SEEMED TO

25:41.100 --> 25:42.367
BRUSH OFF CERTAIN ETHICAL

25:42.433 --> 25:45.333
ISSUES.

25:45.400 --> 25:46.767
>> CRISPR ALLOWS HUMANS --

25:46.834 --> 25:48.400
IT PUTS SO MUCH POWER INTO OUR

25:48.467 --> 25:50.066
HANDS.

25:50.133 --> 25:51.667
IT ALLOWS US TO SHAPE OUR WORLD

25:51.734 --> 25:55.000
IN WAYS NEVER BEFORE IMAGINED.

25:55.066 --> 25:56.300
AND THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN THE

25:56.367 --> 25:57.834
U.S WHO THINK, "WELL, THAT'S --

25:57.900 --> 25:59.667
NO, THAT'S NOT FOR US TO DO,

25:59.734 --> 26:01.834
THAT'S FOR A HIGHER POWER.

26:01.900 --> 26:02.934
THAT'S FOR GOD."

26:03.000 --> 26:04.233
>>

26:04.300 --> 26:05.300
>> SO THE IDEA THAT WE COULD BE

26:05.367 --> 26:06.367
PLAYING THE ROLE OF GOD MAKES A

26:06.433 --> 26:07.767
LOT OF PEOPLE NERVOUS.

26:07.834 --> 26:10.633
>> HMM, OKAY.

26:10.700 --> 26:11.934
>> CLEARLY NOT HERE THOUGH.

26:12.000 --> 26:12.767
>> YEAH, NOT UP HERE, NOT UP

26:12.834 --> 26:14.367
HERE.

26:14.433 --> 26:17.266
>> John: WOW, THAT GUY SEEMS A

26:17.333 --> 26:18.533
LITTLE BIT BLASE ABOUT

26:18.600 --> 26:20.900
GENE-EDITING TECHNOLOGY.

26:20.967 --> 26:21.700
WHICH IS KIND OF SURPRISING IN

26:21.767 --> 26:22.667
A COUNTRY WHOSE PRESIDENT -- AS

26:22.734 --> 26:23.600
YOU MAY REMEMBER FROM OUR SHOW

26:23.667 --> 26:24.533
ABOUT CHINA -- IS A HONEY-EATING

26:24.600 --> 26:31.767
TALKING BEAR.

26:31.834 --> 26:33.100
THE RESEMBLANCE IS STRIKING.

26:33.166 --> 26:35.967
I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WHICH.

26:36.033 --> 26:36.767
AND LOOK, MY POINT IN SHOWING

26:36.834 --> 26:37.700
YOU ALL THIS ISN'T TO FRIGHTEN

26:37.767 --> 26:38.800
YOU -- THERE'S A LOT TO BE

26:38.867 --> 26:39.734
LEGITIMATELY EXCITED ABOUT HERE.

26:39.800 --> 26:40.567
GENE EDITING HAS THE POTENTIAL

26:40.633 --> 26:41.800
TO ALLEVIATE A GREAT DEAL OF

26:41.867 --> 26:42.800
HUMAN SUFFERING.

26:42.867 --> 26:44.200
BUT REACHING THAT POTENTIAL WILL

26:44.266 --> 26:45.100
REQUIRE CAREFUL, TIME-CONSUMING

26:45.166 --> 26:47.000
RESEARCH.

26:47.066 --> 26:48.200
THE SCIENCE INVOLVED IS MUCH

26:48.266 --> 26:50.000
MORE COMPLICATED THAN WE HAD

26:50.066 --> 26:51.800
TIME TO GET INTO, MAINLY BECAUSE

26:51.867 --> 26:53.533
WE NEEDED TO MAKE SPACE FOR THAT

26:53.600 --> 26:54.300
LONG STORY ABOUT A TICK FUCKING

26:54.367 --> 26:58.533
A MOUSE.

26:58.600 --> 26:59.200
AND I EMPHATICALLY STAND BY THAT

26:59.266 --> 27:00.166
DECISION.

27:00.233 --> 27:01.600
BUT WHILE THAT RESEARCH IS

27:01.667 --> 27:03.000
PROGRESSING, WE NEED TO FIGURE
