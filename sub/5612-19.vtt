to use weapons,
but you're not smart.

07:16.471 --> 07:17.604
You're dumb.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.373
You're always naked,
and you pee in a box.

07:19.374 --> 07:20.774
I suppose they're
not totally naked

07:20.775 --> 07:22.309
with the fur.

07:22.310 --> 07:25.112
Anyways, you know how you didn't
solve that case 20 years ago?

07:25.113 --> 07:26.513
Thanks for reminding me.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.815
You don't see me bringing up
how you burned your junk off.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.017
That didn't happen.

07:30.018 --> 07:31.485
There was just some
light blistering.

07:31.486 --> 07:33.620
The point is,
the only thing those bullies

07:33.621 --> 07:36.256
have over you is that you
never solved that case.

07:36.257 --> 07:38.125
So why don't
we solve it together?

07:38.126 --> 07:39.259
How are we gonna do that?

07:39.260 --> 07:40.794
We'll sneak into the 6-5,

07:40.795 --> 07:41.962
steal that old case file,

07:41.963 --> 07:43.664
and work it till we find
your burglar.

07:43.698 --> 07:46.433
Then we march back
into that precinct...

07:46.434 --> 07:47.601
And we grind these kittens up

07:47.602 --> 07:49.002
and shove them
down their throats!

07:49.003 --> 07:50.504
Yes!

07:50.505 --> 07:51.839
[whispering]
Don't listen to him.

07:51.873 --> 07:54.074
You're a part of something
much bigger than yourselves.

07:56.578 --> 07:58.612
Well, good morning, Linetti.

07:58.613 --> 08:01.748
Whoo, I slept like
a frickin' baby last night.

08:01.783 --> 08:04.585
Staying at Chuck's
is like a dream.

08:04.586 --> 08:06.453
Little guy loves doting on me,

08:06.454 --> 08:08.589
although you're gonna need
to buy some bigger underwear

08:08.590 --> 08:09.990
if we're gonna be sharing,
you know what I mean?

08:09.991 --> 08:11.258
Okay, I'll get right on that.

08:11.259 --> 08:12.326
Okay, cool.
Here.

08:12.327 --> 08:13.393
Take care of this for me,
will you?

08:13.394 --> 08:14.561
Yeah.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.963
I'm gonna go get some
breakfast candy.

08:15.964 --> 08:17.631
Okay, catch you later.

08:17.632 --> 08:19.600
So things are going really good

08:19.601 --> 08:21.435
with the new roomie, it seems.

08:21.436 --> 08:22.736
It's horrible.

08:22.737 --> 08:24.304
There's someone's blood
all over the bathroom.

08:24.305 --> 08:26.006
He sleep-choked me twice.

08:26.007 --> 08:27.608
And the worst part...
this morning,

08:27.609 --> 08:29.042
he ate all of my cereal.

08:29.077 --> 08:30.310
That's the worst part?

08:30.311 --> 08:32.913
They were Nortfluskers
bran circles!

08:32.947 --> 08:34.581
I had them shipped from Oslo.

08:34.616 --> 08:36.250
Oh, I want him out.

08:36.251 --> 08:37.784
But I'm too scared to tell him.

08:37.818 --> 08:38.885
All right, listen.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.520
I know that your spirit animal

08:40.522 --> 08:42.558
is a caterpillar
that's been stepped on...

08:42.590 --> 08:45.159
- Mm-hmm.
- But mine is the mighty wolf.

08:45.160 --> 08:47.161
And if you want to
beat an alpha,

08:47.162 --> 08:49.463
you have to be an alpha.

08:49.497 --> 08:50.898
Wrongo.

08:50.899 --> 08:53.000
If you're good enough
at being a beta,

08:53.001 --> 08:54.835
then the alpha
takes mercy on you

08:54.836 --> 08:56.737
and ends up giving you
what you want.

08:56.738 --> 08:58.005
- Boyle.
- Argh!

08:58.006 --> 08:59.139

14:37.748 --> 14:40.583
I just want to tell you how
welcome you are to stay with me

14:40.584 --> 14:42.919

so weird about it.

14:51.261 --> 14:53.896

15:00.337 --> 15:01.704
I'm sorry too.

15:03.440 --> 15:04.674
You didn't.
I was fine.

15:04.675 --> 15:06.843
Well, now you're just
lying to yourself.

15:06.844 --> 15:08.845
But Holt was right.

15:08.846 --> 15:10.179

this more seriously.

15:18.822 --> 15:20.289
Yes, couldn't be better,

15:21.692 --> 15:22.892
What the hell?

15:22.893 --> 15:24.260
I thought you said this
wasn't about winning.

15:24.294 --> 15:25.895
I did say that,
so you would go slower

15:25.896 --> 15:27.697
and I would win,
which is what happened.

You're just as competitive
as we are.

15:29.566 --> 15:31.434
Absurd.
I'm more competitive.

15:31.435 --> 15:34.737
Now who's "da bomb"?

15:36.315 --> 15:38.349
So what did they make you
a sergeant for?

15:38.375 --> 15:40.143
Did you arrest a pine cone?

15:40.144 --> 15:41.577
He passed a written test,

15:41.578 --> 15:43.179
just like
every other sergeant did.

15:43.180 --> 15:44.380
You knew that.

15:44.381 --> 15:45.681
Oh, no,
I thought he might have gotten

15:45.682 --> 15:47.083
some kind of special promotion

15:47.084 --> 15:48.317
from busting a pine cone.

15:48.352 --> 15:49.385
Why do you keep
bringing up pine cones?

15:49.386 --> 15:50.386
That's never been
a part of this.

15:50.387 --> 15:51.387
You know what?

15:51.388 --> 15:52.488
You're gonna eat your words,

15:52.489 --> 15:54.223
because Sarge is about
to solve this case.

15:54.224 --> 15:56.459
What, the old case
or the pine cone one?

15:56.493 --> 15:57.760
You need to stop.

15:57.761 --> 15:59.929
Look, our man Zerb is
sitting right over there,

15:59.930 --> 16:02.398
and yeah, he's connected
to all of the robberies.

16:02.399 --> 16:03.666
And he's shady as hell.

16:03.667 --> 16:04.801

16:04.802 --> 16:06.269
Waiter just gave him
a covert signal.

16:06.270 --> 16:07.403
Now he's getting up.

16:07.438 --> 16:10.573
Yeah, and now he's
following said waiter

16:10.574 --> 16:11.874
to a secondary,

16:11.875 --> 16:15.344
most likely even shadier spot.

16:15.345 --> 16:16.946
Something's going on in there.

16:16.947 --> 16:18.514
- Huh.
- Yeah, right... huh!

16:18.515 --> 16:20.750
- Come on, let's go bust him!
- Come on.

16:28.025 --> 16:29.592
My wife says I cannot
have red meat,

16:29.593 --> 16:31.994
so they sneak in my beef stew.

16:31.995 --> 16:33.096
Please don't shoot.

16:33.097 --> 16:34.897
Oh, my God.

16:34.898 --> 16:36.632

16:36.633 --> 16:38.935
Only this guy's
sitting on a toilet

16:38.936 --> 16:40.203
instead of a wheelchair.

16:40.237 --> 16:41.671
That's even more dumb.

16:41.705 --> 16:42.905
Here, here, Terry.

16:42.906 --> 16:44.870
Move in closer so I can
get you in the photo.

16:46.436 --> 16:47.536
What up, Jake?

16:47.537 --> 16:48.670
Why are these dicks
out of their cage?

16:48.704 --> 16:49.805
I stayed up all night

16:49.806 --> 16:50.906
working on your case,

16:50.907 --> 16:52.774
and Hans, John, and Nakatomi

16:52.775 --> 16:54.042
made for great company.

16:54.043 --> 16:55.510
I gave them all
"Die Hard" names.

16:55.511 --> 16:57.946
I don't understand why
you wasted another night

16:57.947 --> 17:00.048
on a case no one's
ever gonna solve.

17:00.049 --> 17:01.817
Sarge, I am way too
sleep-deprived

17:01.818 --> 17:03.452
to deal with
your negativity right now.

17:03.453 --> 17:05.053
Let me show you what I did.

17:05.054 --> 17:06.421
I started off by making a map

17:06.422 --> 17:09.057
of all of the burglaries
that have gone down in Brooklyn

17:09.058 --> 17:11.492
since 1996 to see
if there was a pattern.

17:11.493 --> 17:14.628
That led me to this.

17:14.630 --> 17:16.565
There is so much crime
in New York.

17:16.566 --> 17:18.133
No one should live here.

17:18.134 --> 17:20.367
Anyways, I tripped out
on that for a couple hours,

17:20.368 --> 17:21.970
but I got cheered up

17:21.971 --> 17:23.438
after a took a picture
of the kitties

17:23.439 --> 17:24.606
messing around in
my little hoodie.

17:24.607 --> 17:25.741
I'll show it to you later.

17:25.775 --> 17:27.175
So basically, you wasted
a whole night.

17:27.175 --> 17:28.443
No, no, no, my friend.

17:28.444 --> 17:30.645
No, no, no, 'cause then
I dove back into your file

17:30.646 --> 17:33.215
and found this.

17:33.216 --> 17:35.484
Cool, the low point
of my entire life.

17:35.485 --> 17:37.986
Sarge, this photo
was taken in 1996.

17:37.987 --> 17:39.754
You told me your guy
broke his spine

17:39.755 --> 17:42.257
two years before that, so '94.

17:42.258 --> 17:43.391
Check out his sneakers.

17:45.261 --> 17:46.628
'95 Jordans.

17:46.629 --> 17:48.830

after the accident.

17:48.831 --> 17:50.999
Look at the soles.

17:51.033 --> 17:52.032
They're all muddy.

17:52.035 --> 17:53.068
Which means...

17:53.069 --> 17:55.537
That son of a bitch can walk!

17:55.571 --> 17:57.205
- Bingo.
- Let's go!

17:57.206 --> 17:59.775
All right.
Cat squad, assemble!

17:59.776 --> 18:01.743
- Leave the cats.
- Okay.

18:01.778 --> 18:03.445
Santiago, Diaz, I wanted
to talk to you

18:03.446 --> 18:04.613
about our performance
in yesterday's

18:04.614 --> 18:05.914
bomb defusing course.

18:05.948 --> 18:07.115
We know, sir.
You won.

18:07.116 --> 18:09.618
No, the three of us all failed.

18:09.652 --> 18:11.019
Apparently our instructor felt

18:11.020 --> 18:13.655
we didn't take it
seriously enough.

18:13.656 --> 18:15.223
But Hitchcock and Scully passed.

18:15.224 --> 18:16.491
What?

18:16.492 --> 18:18.326
How did they defuse bombs
better than we did?

18:18.327 --> 18:20.595
- Those were bombs?
- Unbelievable.

18:20.630 --> 18:22.397
It's a low moment for us all.

18:22.398 --> 18:24.132
I think the lesson here is
that we should not allow

18:24.133 --> 18:27.235
our competitiveness to interfere
with the sanctity of our job.

18:27.236 --> 18:28.937
