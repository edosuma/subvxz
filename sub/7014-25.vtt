00:04.229 --> 00:05.358
uh-huh.

00:06.119 --> 00:07.825
Red. Red!

00:07.904 --> 00:11.001
Cousin alice wants to know
why eric and donna's wedding is off.

00:11.054 --> 00:14.046
Well, just tell her what your son did.

00:14.834 --> 00:20.112
Oh, now he's my son, just like when
he told us he wanted to be a jazz dancer.

00:20.820 --> 00:23.524
Well, he's our son, red.

00:23.603 --> 00:28.905
No son of mine would humiliate his family
by running off on his fiancée.

00:29.929 --> 00:31.767
Alice?

00:31.898 --> 00:36.492
The wedding is off because eric is... gay.

00:38.382 --> 00:43.291
You're right.. Everybody knew except him.

00:45.969 --> 00:48.961
Eric is a mental midget.

00:49.643 --> 00:52.636
And you know what else?
He runs like a girl.

00:53.187 --> 00:56.384
Bob, you run like a girl.

00:56.652 --> 00:59.566
Only when I'm scared of something.

00:59.907 --> 01:03.687
Oh, honey, I'm sure eric has a good explanation.

01:03.740 --> 01:10.224
On the several occasions, I didn't show up for one of
my weddings, I always called to say I had appendicitis.

01:11.064 --> 01:15.342
Well, eric's not here. My little girl's unhappy,
and I wanna punch somebody.

01:15.421 --> 01:18.020
Bob, you don't want to fight.

01:18.099 --> 01:23.992
I've known you for a long time, and I know
what you really want is a piece of cake.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.434
A piece of cake, kitty?

01:26.486 --> 01:32.209
My daughter is devastated, and you offer me cake?
You just tell me one thing.. is it chocolate?

01:33.521 --> 01:36.698
Devil's food. I can have it on the table
in less than a minute.

01:36.929 --> 01:39.212
Eh. Let's do that, then.

01:41.076 --> 01:47.350
Okay, um, guys, donna's on her way over, and she knows
we all know why eric left, and she wants some answers.

01:47.456 --> 01:49.671
Well, I'm not gonna tell her.

01:49.732 --> 01:52.610
Give donna bad news, and she hits.

01:53.570 --> 01:57.114
She wasn't on the boys' J.V.Wrestling
team for nothing.

01:58.374 --> 02:00.342
Okay, well, I can't do it.

02:00.395 --> 02:05.461
The last person a girl wants to hear bad
news from is a woman who has it all.

02:06.511 --> 02:12.376
Well, you can count me out. I won't face a girl when I ditch her.
I'm not gonna do it when somebody else does.

02:13.715 --> 02:16.208
Well, I'm not telling her, either.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.859
I don't want my personal parts damaged.

02:20.539 --> 02:23.007
I mean, they're practically brand-new.

02:25.317 --> 02:29.228
Well, in a dead lock such as this,
we're forced to turn to our judicial code,

02:29.281 --> 02:35.108
which clearly states, that in the event of bad news
being delivered in reference to a cancelled wedding,

02:35.187 --> 02:37.156
the foreigner does it.

02:37.445 --> 02:42.853
Ah, yes-- the immigration conversation act.

02:45.031 --> 02:48.549
Where the hell is eric,
and why did he do this to me?

02:54.041 --> 02:56.823
Um, okay, um...

03:01.233 --> 03:06.326
eric was afraid getting married
and staying here was a mistake...

03:13.546 --> 03:18.376
you know, because you would be giving up your dream
of traveling the world and becoming a

03:18.454 --> 03:20.633
ball-breaking feminist.

03:21.237 --> 03:23.809
- Jackie, don't push!
- You don't push!    - Hey, hey. Hey!

03:23.888 --> 03:26.356
Knock it off before fez gets hurt.

03:33.102 --> 03:37.136
Look, I just want to say that we're
all really sorry.

03:37.958 --> 03:41.764
How could eric ditch me the night before
our wedding without saying one word?

03:41.870 --> 03:46.148
Look, would it make you feel better
if I told you that eric left a note?

03:46.726 --> 03:49.377
- He left a note?
- No.

03:51.005 --> 03:54.758
But you should hold on to that feeling.

03:57.935 --> 04:00.954

eric.

04:38.664 --> 04:40.581
what a dink, right?

04:41.748 --> 04:44.731
You know, I had to call everybody
and tell them the wedding's off.

04:45.798 --> 04:49.214
The only good thing is, there's a rumor
going around that he's gay,

04:49.866 --> 04:51.999
which is nice.

04:53.016 --> 04:56.316
Look, man, I mean, I know you're mad, but

04:57.049 --> 05:00.807
you know, forman was trying to
do the right thing.

05:00.874 --> 05:02.574
He just did it in the wrong way.

05:02.624 --> 05:05.152
Yeah, but, hyde, I don't care why he did it.

05:05.624 --> 05:07.891
I mean, I can't ever forgive him.

05:08.824 --> 05:12.807
When I called my mom, I just cried and cried.

05:13.398 --> 05:16.065
Really? I can't see you crying.

05:16.181 --> 05:18.248
I've seen forman crying.

05:18.365 --> 05:23.315
He does a lot of...
"shut up! I'm not crying!"

05:24.248 --> 05:28.031
- I want to be mad. Don't make me laugh.
- Oh! Whoa!

05:31.531 --> 05:33.989
oh, my god! Hyde, are you okay?

05:34.060 --> 05:36.510
I'm too old for this crap!

05:37.018 --> 05:40.368
Why am I stronger than all the guys
I hang out with?

05:47.129 --> 05:49.046
You look dorky.

05:52.965 --> 05:54.481
Hyde,

05:54.673 --> 05:56.623
I am so sorry.

05:56.865 --> 05:58.748
I don't know my own strength.

05:58.856 --> 06:03.731
I mean, I guess I'm still all bulked up
from J.V. Wrestling.

06:04.856 --> 06:07.206
You know what? This isn't my fault.

06:07.256 --> 06:09.874
This is eric's fault for taking off.

06:10.024 --> 06:14.474
Hey, look at the bright side. Now I can spy
on you from eric's empty bedroom...

06:15.690 --> 06:19.824
instead of climbing up a tree
where there's no place to put my juice box.

06:22.455 --> 06:26.055
Man, I can't believe I missed you falling
out of the water tower.

06:26.105 --> 06:29.272
So I'm at home,
and I'm watching "scooby-doo,"

06:30.155 --> 06:33.655
and I think to myself, "you know what?
"You should go and hang out with hyde and donna."

06:33.705 --> 06:38.122
And then I think, "no, because maybe scooby
and shaggy found a real ghost this time."

06:39.722 --> 06:43.322
But it wasn't.
It was just another crazy old guy.

06:44.405 --> 06:47.422
Oh, steven, I heard what happened.

06:48.213 --> 06:51.496
- And you brought me flowers?
- No, these are for me.

06:52.388 --> 06:55.738
My boyfriend fell off the water tower.

06:56.371 --> 07:00.538
So what, donna, you're alone,
and you want me to be alone, too?

07:01.796 --> 07:05.863
Okay, steven, get on home.
I'll take care of you later.

07:07.329 --> 07:10.213
Trade you a kiss for a lollipop.

07:10.796 --> 07:12.996
I don't need that baby crap.

07:23.355 --> 07:26.622
Oh, look at all this glorious wedding food.

07:27.972 --> 07:30.872
Do you, fez, take this pizza roll?

07:33.382 --> 07:34.963
I do.

07:37.037 --> 07:39.770
You know what part of falling off
the water tower I like?

07:39.820 --> 07:43.231
The part right after you fall until
the part where you hit the ground.

07:43.931 --> 07:47.181
Yeah. And then that part right after you crash
where you're just kind of vibrating there?

07:47.214 --> 07:48.631
Oh, yeah!

07:48.698 --> 07:50.448
That was cool, too.

07:50.848 --> 07:55.333
Yeah, and the second time you fall, it'll be
even better, 'cause you know what to expect.

07:55.783 --> 07:59.033
You know, so you can enjoy it,
like, do a flip or something.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.216
Oh, a flip would be awesome!

08:02.933 --> 08:06.504
Man, I'm so glad you fell off the water tower.

08:07.587 --> 08:12.854
look at this. Eric's gone, and I'm left
with the flying stupid-ass-insky brothers.

08:17.597 --> 08:20.614
- Mom?
- MIDGE!!

08:22.164 --> 08:26.014
Oh, you sounded so sad on the phone,
I just had to come.

08:30.314 --> 08:32.618
we missed you so much.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.630
All right. All right.
Donna, quit hogging your mom!

08:42.163 --> 08:47.563
I know something very interesting
about someone we know very well.

08:48.613 --> 08:52.080
No, no. None of your supermarket gossip.

08:52.696 --> 08:57.163
If half of what you say is true,
everybody in this town would have V.D.

08:58.646 --> 09:00.029
Well,

09:00.546 --> 09:04.817
I was going over steven's file when he was
at the hospital, and you know his father?

09:04.867 --> 09:08.417
I believe I had the pleasure of him
writing me a hot check.

09:09.150 --> 09:11.850
Of course, in his defense, he was drunk.

09:12.384 --> 09:13.550
Well,

09:14.034 --> 09:18.967
Well, according to steven's birth certificate,
that's not his father.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.767
This is so exciting!

09:23.222 --> 09:25.689
Steven has a different father
that he doesn't know about--

09:25.739 --> 09:28.822
maybe a nice father. Maybe a sober father.

09:29.172 --> 09:30.039
Well,

09:30.105 --> 09:33.889
we don't want him to be entirely sober.
You know how those people are.

09:36.289 --> 09:39.289
Mom, I can't tell you how much
it means to me that you're here.

09:39.322 --> 09:42.439
Well, there are times when a mother
has to be there for her baby,

09:42.505 --> 09:46.178
like now and, I guess, when she's born.

09:46.361 --> 09:51.544
You know, mrs. Pinciotti, in my younger days,
I had quite the crush on you

09:51.594 --> 09:53.594
even though I knew nothing could ever happen.

09:53.627 --> 09:57.261
But now that I'm older,
and I'm gonna be a father soon,

09:57.311 --> 10:00.327
if anything does happen,
we gotta keep it quiet.

10:00.944 --> 10:06.410
Steven, you're late. Where.. midge!
Hey.. what a surprise.

10:06.694 --> 10:10.961
Huh. I should probably return these
earrings I didn't know were yours.

10:13.194 --> 10:15.211
Midge, what are you doing here?

10:15.261 --> 10:17.327
I came to see donna.

10:17.427 --> 10:19.527
Who's the amazon?

10:20.744 --> 10:23.827
Oh, this is my, uh, friend.

10:24.658 --> 10:27.658
"Friend"? I don't think so.

10:27.908 --> 10:31.725
Hi, I'm pam, the best thing that ever
happened to him.

10:32.825 --> 10:36.522
I'm midge, the second best thing
that ever happened to him.

10:37.725 --> 10:39.808
Dad, I invited her to stay with us.

10:39.858 --> 10:41.591
Your mom is staying with us?

10:41.641 --> 10:43.625
No, your mom is staying with us.

10:43.658 --> 10:46.708
- What about my mom?
- Well, that's not my mom, that's your mom.

10:46.741 --> 10:49.358
I'm confused. Who am I sleeping with?

10:55.041 --> 10:56.158
Steven,

10:56.758 --> 11:00.358
we need to talk to you about
something pretty important.

11:00.424 --> 11:03.124
Look, whatever you found
in my room was planted there.

11:04.074 --> 11:06.158
- No. We..
- what's in your room?

11:06.241 --> 11:09.691
- Red, stay focused.
- Yeah, stay focused.

11:10.474 --> 11:15.674
All right, steven, just for the record,
I told her to mind her own business,

11:15.891 --> 11:19.541
and then she said,
"fine, you can make your own dinner."

11:20.988 --> 11:24.038
So.. ha ha.. here we are.

11:24.888 --> 11:27.255
No. No, no. No.
Steven,

11:27.538 --> 11:33.017
we found out that the man you think
is your father isn't really your father.

11:33.371 --> 11:38.238
Your real father's name is william barnett,
and he lives in milwaukee.

11:38.850 --> 11:41.967
Oh, my god! Steven, this is so exciting!

11:42.017 --> 11:45.884
You have a whole new family,
which is great, because I hate your family!

11:46.167 --> 11:47.367
Steven,

11:47.817 --> 11:51.934
I know you have a lot of feelings
and emotions, and

11:52.017 --> 11:54.284
maybe you want to cry.

11:55.350 --> 11:57.888
We won't tell if you cry.

11:58.317 --> 12:00.100
I'll tell.

12:01.033 --> 12:03.500
Yeah, I don't like guys that cry.

12:03.833 --> 12:07.466
Will you two please?
Steven, are you okay?

12:09.700 --> 12:11.016
Well, I..

12:11.666 --> 12:14.716
don't really know the guy who's supposed
to be my dad,

12:15.016 --> 12:18.666
and obviously, I don't know this new guy,

12:20.383 --> 12:24.375
- ..so I don't really care.
- Oh, but, steven, you have to care!

12:24.466 --> 12:30.516
What if your new dad is something amazing like
a doctor... or the guy who owns "the love boat"?

12:32.777 --> 12:34.427
That didn't go well.

12:34.810 --> 12:36.344
What did you want to happen?

12:36.760 --> 12:41.427
Well, I thoughthe would be happy to hear about his dad.
We all go to milwaukee, and then his

12:41.460 --> 12:46.185
his rich, new father would be so thrilled
to see him, he'd buy me a fur coat.

12:53.456 --> 12:56.839
Bob, could you pass the syrup?

13:01.122 --> 13:02.839
You're gonna give her the syrup?

13:04.305 --> 13:08.297
The syrup we share every morning?

13:08.930 --> 13:14.262
The syrup that stands for everything
that we are as a man and a woman?

13:15.512 --> 13:17.246
I was gonna...

13:18.496 --> 13:20.229
but I won'T.

13:21.062 --> 13:22.996
I will later.

13:25.271 --> 13:27.088
No, I wont.

13:30.854 --> 13:32.054
How's it going?

13:32.105 --> 13:33.871
Your father's an ass.

13:33.921 --> 13:35.671
Oh, something we agree on.

13:35.738 --> 13:37.655
It's not going that well.

13:38.405 --> 13:39.521
Okay,

13:40.271 --> 13:42.888
I find this whole thing very disturbing.

13:42.938 --> 13:44.655
I was left at the altar,

13:44.738 --> 13:47.610
and all I can think about is what's my dad doing,

13:47.710 --> 13:49.293
who's he doing it with

13:49.393 --> 13:52.960
and if I walk through that door,
am I gonna see it?

13:55.077 --> 13:56.277
Well,

13:56.330 --> 13:59.480
whatever he's doing, he's doing with me,

13:59.664 --> 14:02.797
and we're doing it everywhere, so.. knock.

14:08.167 --> 14:12.484
So after we left, steven said he didn't want
to talk about his new dad in milwaukee,

14:12.567 --> 14:17.534
and he didn't. And he wasn't not talking
about it to be bitchy, like I would.

14:19.199 --> 14:21.665
He really didn't want to talk about it.

14:22.249 --> 14:26.399
Well, I don't like the way he just walked out after
we told him the news. Why would he do that?

14:26.432 --> 14:28.832
Because he's a man, kitty...

14:30.515 --> 14:34.039
and he knows you want him to cry,
but he won't,

14:34.305 --> 14:37.772
because crying is for babies and italians.

14:40.155 --> 14:45.588
And I think we all just need to stay
outta his business.

14:49.039 --> 14:50.822
Steven, you're all dressed up.

14:50.889 --> 14:53.372
are you gonna propose?

14:54.397 --> 14:56.513
No. I, uh...

14:57.144 --> 14:59.744
I thought I'd head out to milwaukee.

14:59.811 --> 15:01.427
By yourself?

15:01.661 --> 15:03.261
Yeah, I guess.

15:04.011 --> 15:06.044
So I'll see you guys later, then.

15:10.950 --> 15:12.717
Well, uh...

15:12.800 --> 15:17.767
we were just, uh,
talking about going to milwaukee..

15:18.934 --> 15:20.932
for their famous...

15:21.065 --> 15:22.665
honey buns.

15:24.249 --> 15:27.899
Well, you guys could come along, I guess.

15:28.049 --> 15:31.870
Well, I'm.. I'm sure in the mood for a..

15:31.954 --> 15:33.754
honey bun.

15:36.387 --> 15:41.103
And to see baby go home to his daddy!

15:44.475 --> 15:47.842
So midge wanted you to pass the syrup...

15:49.859 --> 15:52.275
and pam wouldn't let you.

15:53.542 --> 15:54.992
That's interesting.

15:55.575 --> 15:57.525
What do you think it means?

15:57.825 --> 16:02.859
I think it means you got a shot at something
only rock stars and professional athletes get.

16:03.684 --> 16:06.400
Free passes to disneyland?

16:07.217 --> 16:08.884
No, fez,

16:08.917 --> 16:10.884
two ladies at the same time.

16:10.934 --> 16:13.950
Ah, screw disneyland.
That's a much better ride.

16:16.418 --> 16:18.251
Think I could really keep both of them?

16:18.284 --> 16:22.418
May I say from experience, when you're dealing
with two ladies, the end won't be pretty,

16:22.484 --> 16:25.001
but the ride down is super fun.

16:28.336 --> 16:30.170
I don't know what to do, mom.

16:30.586 --> 16:33.970
I mean, I always thought eric and
I would be together, and

16:34.319 --> 16:36.053
he blew it.

16:36.103 --> 16:38.986
- Maybe you'll work it out.
- Well, I don't want to work it out.

16:39.053 --> 16:42.720
I want to push his face in the dirt
like we did when we were kids.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.603
You know what? I never should
have stopped doing that.

16:47.736 --> 16:50.136
Donna, just forgive him.

16:50.653 --> 16:53.203
How? Give me one good reason.

16:53.253 --> 16:57.269
Oh, honey, I can't give you a rational reason.
There probably isn't one.

16:57.319 --> 17:02.286
But if you love him, and you don't want to be
without him, you have to forgive him.

17:02.536 --> 17:06.219
I was too hard headed to forgive
your father, and I wish I had.

17:06.685 --> 17:08.469
Aw, midge.

17:11.169 --> 17:15.902
- You want to take a walk?
- Sure! I'll drive.

17:22.789 --> 17:27.006
Did you see that? Maybe someone
will have a happy ending.

17:27.056 --> 17:32.289
And then another beginning and another
ending, because he's got two ladies!

17:34.040 --> 17:38.656
Bob pinciotti, a street kid outta nowhere,
gets a shot at the title.

17:39.598 --> 17:43.664
You know what? He's like..
He's like the rocky of bagging two ladies.

17:48.527 --> 17:52.710
It's a big day, meeting your father
for the first time.

17:52.743 --> 17:54.477
- Mmm.
- You bet.

17:54.543 --> 17:57.960
A big day for my big guy, huh?

17:58.998 --> 18:00.848
- Mm-hmm.
- So

18:00.965 --> 18:02.815
how you doing?

18:02.981 --> 18:04.298
I'm fine.

18:04.365 --> 18:07.831
Oh, you doing all right, baby?
Just quit! Stop! Stop!

18:08.498 --> 18:12.632
Keep it down. This isn't your parole office.

18:15.981 --> 18:17.798
mr. Barnett will see you now.

18:17.831 --> 18:19.698
Okay. Okay. This is it.

18:19.748 --> 18:23.748
Jackie, here's the camera. Take a picture
of steven the minute he sees his father.

18:23.781 --> 18:27.348
If he cries, and you miss it, I will hurt you.

18:29.464 --> 18:31.969
Um, where's steven?

18:32.036 --> 18:33.202
He left.

18:33.236 --> 18:36.702
Yeah. I saw him go, and I didn't say
anything on purpose.

18:36.786 --> 18:39.986
All right, let's go.. Come on.

18:42.236 --> 18:46.286
- kitty!
- I came all this way. I want my fur coat.

19:12.083 --> 19:17.104
- Who's there? Who's there?
- Ow! Ow! Jeez, donna, stop!

19:17.250 --> 19:19.583
Oh, god. I didn't know it was you.

19:19.646 --> 19:24.146
- You dirtbag! How could you do that? You just left me there!
- I'm sorry.

19:24.750 --> 19:27.479
I'm sorry. I freaked out, okay?

19:28.250 --> 19:30.584
I tried to talk to you about it, but

19:30.979 --> 19:32.396
I couldn't, and I..

19:32.605 --> 19:34.646
I didn't know what to do.

19:35.625 --> 19:37.688
All I knew was that I...

19:39.084 --> 19:42.834
donna, I think we were about
to make a huge mistake.

19:44.229 --> 19:46.625
Yeah, I know what you mean.

19:47.541 --> 19:49.917
I had a bad feeling, too.

19:50.333 --> 19:53.687
But here's the difference.. I stayed.

19:57.702 --> 19:59.806
Look, donna, please...

20:01.265 --> 20:03.119
please forgive me.

20:04.619 --> 20:06.161
I don't know.

20:07.827 --> 20:09.348
I mean,

20:10.452 --> 20:13.662
my mom said I should, but...

20:15.787 --> 20:17.349
I don't know.

20:18.412 --> 20:24.599
Listen to me. I am so sorry. Okay, whatever
you want to do, we'll do, okay? Just.. just

20:24.724 --> 20:26.766
tell me what to do.

20:31.162 --> 20:35.013
We'll figure it out tomorrow. Just get in.

20:35.097 --> 20:36.847
Really?

20:52.137 --> 20:54.387
thanks for coming back.

21:05.209 --> 21:07.356
I just want to say...

21:08.988 --> 21:11.238
that was beautiful.

21:29.922 --> 21:31.220
What the...

21:31.874 --> 21:35.999
glad you're back. Here's a bill for
the wedding you didn't show up for.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.812
$6,000?

21:37.895 --> 21:41.603
Mm-hmm. I added on a grand
for pain and suffering.

21:41.957 --> 21:43.615
Thanks, daddy.

21:43.678 --> 21:48.012
Buy yourself something nice with it.
I suggest a new boyfriend.

21:48.093 --> 21:49.715
Okay !
