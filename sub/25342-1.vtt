00:45.875 --> 00:50.499
Welcome back
to my astrophysics show.

01:05.375 --> 01:08.374
Let's draw several spots on the balloon.

01:12.958 --> 01:15.999
The last fart of our star.

01:22.125 --> 01:27.999
There's no energy left,
the sun explodes.

01:29.041 --> 01:34.124
Check the distance between the objects.

01:36.083 --> 01:37.290
We're gone.

01:39.125 --> 01:40.125
Gone.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.124
If we blow a bit more...

01:42.458 --> 01:48.290
Fear is gone, sin is gone.

01:48.541 --> 01:55.415
We quickly notice that the distance
between the objects is growing.

01:56.541 --> 01:57.915
And love is gone, too.

01:58.833 --> 02:00.707
That's how the universe works.

02:00.916 --> 02:04.665
And us, well... We think we're alive,

02:06.458 --> 02:09.374
counting those pathetic days and months,

02:11.125 --> 02:17.665
while in another dimension
the catastrophe already happened.

02:19.083 --> 02:20.290
We're dead.

02:50.625 --> 02:53.790
A film by

02:56.916 --> 03:02.415
PANIC ATTACK

03:05.125 --> 03:06.125
You feel anything?

03:06.166 --> 03:07.499
Not yet. You?

03:08.375 --> 03:09.499
Me neither.

03:11.916 --> 03:13.915
Dziku! You feel anything?

03:22.166 --> 03:23.874
Do you believe in karma?

03:25.125 --> 03:26.332
What karma?

03:27.333 --> 03:29.582
That karma comes back to you.

03:30.375 --> 03:35.582
If you do something bad,
something bad will happen to you, too.

03:36.625 --> 03:39.790
If you do good things,
those good things come back to you.

03:39.958 --> 03:42.124
Maybe you didn't put enough.

03:42.375 --> 03:43.582
It's enough.

03:44.125 --> 03:46.124
How do you know how much is enough?

03:46.333 --> 03:49.415
Maybe you think it's enough,
but actually it's not enough.

03:55.583 --> 03:56.624
And this.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.665
Yes?

04:00.833 --> 04:03.624
- Where are you sitting?
- Over here.

04:03.791 --> 04:07.165
Would you mind swapping seats?

04:07.583 --> 04:10.415
Agatka's not feeling well.
She'd like to be closer to the lavatory.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.749
Yeah, let's swap.

04:11.916 --> 04:14.040
- Are you sure?
- No problem. Right, Ela?

04:14.208 --> 04:15.707
We don't want to be any trouble...

04:16.125 --> 04:17.707
it's no trouble at all.

04:17.916 --> 04:18.916
Thanks.

04:21.208 --> 04:23.665
Something's up with her today.

04:24.375 --> 04:25.665
Something's up.

04:30.625 --> 04:33.457
I wonder if they'd swap if you asked.

04:36.291 --> 04:37.915
What's your problem?

04:39.500 --> 04:40.874
He's your boss.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.832
He knows you can't refuse
and he's using you.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.124
Because I swapped stupid seats?

04:47.375 --> 04:49.707
Ela, come on. Are you serious?

04:52.166 --> 04:53.999
Turn the airplane mode on.

04:58.083 --> 05:00.499
You can sit by the window.

05:00.750 --> 05:03.290
No one else is boarding the plane.

05:03.458 --> 05:04.874
I don't want to.

05:05.583 --> 05:09.290
- Move over. No one will sit there.
- I don't want to.

05:11.416 --> 05:15.874
Move over. Or I will, if you don't.

05:17.166 --> 05:18.832
And if I do, there's no swapping.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.999
- Go ahead.
- Alright, I will, you'll see.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.874
Hello. I got through, finally...

07:03.708 --> 07:04.749
We're listening.

07:04.916 --> 07:07.665
So, my neighbor died three weeks ago.

07:07.958 --> 07:10.749
She's waiting for someone, poor thing.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.165
She's six years old, cream...

07:14.541 --> 07:15.832
What's her name?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Diana.

07:17.208 --> 07:20.957
- Lovely...
- She has those sad eyes...

07:21.166 --> 07:25.332
Because her mistress died two years ago,
and now her master.

07:26.166 --> 07:31.624
She's been vaccinated, sterilized,
she's very good and so we're waiting.

07:32.333 --> 07:34.332
I wrote advertisements...

07:34.750 --> 07:38.832
Can't you take that poor pooch?

07:40.083 --> 07:40.915
Hello?

07:41.083 --> 07:42.540
I wish I could.

07:42.708 --> 07:45.165
Well why can't you, Mrs. Krystyna?

07:47.958 --> 07:49.332
What did I tell you?

07:49.500 --> 07:52.499
- I'm on the phone.
- What did I tell you?

07:52.833 --> 07:55.707
My room is off limits to those animals!

07:56.625 --> 07:57.415
You're washing this.

07:57.583 --> 08:01.040
I don't care what you come up with.
I'm leaving for work, I want it clean.

08:03.916 --> 08:06.874
What the fuck is this,
a house or a zoo?!

08:08.500 --> 08:12.499
If you had hung it properly,
the cat wouldn't lie down on it.

08:17.458 --> 08:22.165
Maybe think from time to time,
instead of doing everything last minute.

08:25.166 --> 08:28.915
Leave that computer
when you're talking to me, Miłosz!

08:31.000 --> 08:34.539
- Miłosz!
- Jesus! There. Happy?

08:35.916 --> 08:38.332
How dare you talk to me like that?!

08:38.500 --> 08:39.039
Like what?!

08:39.207 --> 08:40.332
Like that!

08:47.541 --> 08:50.165
We'll see what happens when I'm gone.

08:50.375 --> 08:52.165
Yeah, yeah, give me a break.

08:52.375 --> 08:54.624
You better watch that tone.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.332
Breakfast is ready.

09:05.666 --> 09:07.749
Take that dog away from me.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.332
Kapsel, get over here.

09:14.708 --> 09:16.540
Kapsel, get over here.

09:20.291 --> 09:24.332
I'm asking politely...

09:24.541 --> 09:29.540
- Take that dog, now.
- Kapsel, come over here. Kapsel, come.

09:29.750 --> 09:31.665
- Go away.
- Come here.

09:37.166 --> 09:39.915
You should call your sister.
You don't even care.

09:40.083 --> 09:41.874
She doesn't call me either.

09:42.041 --> 09:46.374
You could take her as an example.
Kama has a normal job.

09:46.916 --> 09:49.749
And mine isn't normal?

09:50.875 --> 09:53.874
You could sell windows, too.
You could work in a company...

09:54.708 --> 09:57.290
And where do you think I work?
In a zoo?

09:57.458 --> 09:59.457
I live in a zoo.

10:07.750 --> 10:10.749
- Then move out. You're free to go.
- I will move out.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.749
- Then move out!
- I will.

10:12.916 --> 10:14.665
- Then move out!
- I will move out!

10:14.833 --> 10:17.665
- Then move out!
- I will move out! You...

10:17.833 --> 10:19.457
I wonder what you'll be eating.

10:19.625 --> 10:20.415
Dogs!

10:20.583 --> 10:21.665
Your dogs.

10:23.125 --> 10:26.665
Those animals are waiting.

10:27.375 --> 10:29.790
Their suffering is unimaginable.

10:30.375 --> 10:33.749
- Imagine...
- Wait, I need to make a call.

10:33.916 --> 10:39.832
...imagine that our entire world
collapses and we can't comprehend it...

10:40.000 --> 10:43.249
Hey, you've reached Kama.
I can't talk right now, leave a message.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.207
Many South American languages

11:52.375 --> 11:53.874
are already extinct.

11:54.041 --> 11:55.582
They disappeared during

11:55.750 --> 11:59.832
the European invasion on indigenous...

12:05.750 --> 12:06.499
Hello?

12:06.666 --> 12:07.666
Kama?

12:08.708 --> 12:10.040
Yes. Who is this?

12:10.250 --> 12:12.999
What do you mean "who is this"?
Come on, don't you recognize me?

12:13.166 --> 12:14.166
Ah, Wika.

12:15.458 --> 12:16.458
What's up?

12:17.208 --> 12:18.665
Have you heard?

12:21.041 --> 12:22.207
About what?

12:22.708 --> 12:23.957
So you haven't.

12:26.041 --> 12:27.707
No... what happened?

12:29.250 --> 12:30.749
Everybody knows.

12:33.625 --> 12:34.749
About what?

12:35.291 --> 12:40.124
- You better sit down.
- Just tell me.

12:42.333 --> 12:45.874
- I don't know how...
- Jesus, just say it.

12:46.041 --> 12:48.874
- Are you sitting down?
- Yes, I'm sitting down.

12:49.416 --> 12:51.165
Kama...

12:51.500 --> 12:52.500
Witek is dead.

12:54.375 --> 12:56.624
God... he shot himself.

12:58.250 --> 12:59.707
You still there?

13:00.375 --> 13:01.207
Hello?

13:01.375 --> 13:03.665
Wait...

13:03.833 --> 13:04.999
What Witek?

13:05.916 --> 13:07.124
Your Witek.

13:08.083 --> 13:09.249
"My Witek"?

13:09.625 --> 13:15.915
Our Witek, what was his last name...
curly hair, he was in our class.

13:17.458 --> 13:18.874
Ah... that Witek.

13:20.125 --> 13:24.665
Was he ever into guns?

13:25.083 --> 13:26.083
Please...

13:26.625 --> 13:27.999
The funeral's on Tuesday.

13:28.166 --> 13:31.082
- Are you going?
- I'm not sure I can.

13:31.416 --> 13:33.374
Are you going somewhere?

13:34.458 --> 13:35.790
- Yes.
- Where to?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
On a trip.

13:39.041 --> 13:42.374
Ah, okay. Then let's meet tomorrow.

13:42.833 --> 13:44.582
I'm leaving tomorrow.

13:46.291 --> 13:48.249
When are you coming back?

13:48.708 --> 13:49.874
In a month.

13:51.333 --> 13:54.249
Where are you going for an entire month?

13:55.916 --> 13:56.916
America.

13:57.458 --> 13:59.415
A month in the US, nice.

14:00.208 --> 14:02.040
- No, it's South America.
- No shit.

14:02.250 --> 14:06.665
We're planning a trip with David...
Where exactly are you going?

15:04.666 --> 15:05.666
Hi.

15:07.750 --> 15:08.750
Hi.

15:15.708 --> 15:19.999
I thought it would be more peaceful.

15:20.166 --> 15:21.766
- Do you want to go somewhere else?
- No.

15:21.916 --> 15:23.832
- Are you sure?
- No, it's alright.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.957
Good, because they have
great food here.

15:27.375 --> 15:29.249
Let's order right away.

15:31.375 --> 15:32.749
What are you having?

15:33.791 --> 15:35.290
Something small.

15:36.416 --> 15:38.457
Don't tell me you're on a diet.

15:38.625 --> 15:39.625
No. I'm not hungry.

15:39.916 --> 15:42.415
But I am.
And I don't want to eat alone.

15:42.583 --> 15:43.583
Why?

15:44.666 --> 15:47.124
Because you'll keep staring at me.

15:47.333 --> 15:49.124
Am I supposed to not look at you?

15:49.333 --> 15:51.457
No, just don't stare.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.445
That's just how it works.
You'll have nothing else to do...

15:54.541 --> 15:58.457
...so you'll keep staring
while I chew, swallow, drool...

16:01.333 --> 16:02.333
Trust me.

16:02.708 --> 16:04.332
As long as we both order,
it's all good.

16:10.166 --> 16:11.665
Doula, my spiritual guide.

16:11.833 --> 16:13.874
D.O.U.L.A., that's how you spell it.

16:14.083 --> 16:17.040
She accompanies you during childbirth.

16:17.208 --> 16:21.540
She told me to give birth in headphones.
Silence, water, dimmed lights...

16:21.750 --> 16:25.624
This is my aunt Marzena from Racibórz...

16:26.166 --> 16:28.624
- This is Łukasz, Dawid's friend.
- Yes, from college.

16:28.791 --> 16:31.874
Could you take a picture?
Sir, could you...?

16:32.041 --> 16:35.457
Doula introduced us to birthing centers.

16:35.625 --> 16:39.915
Doula's fine, sis,
but there will still be a doctor, right?

16:40.083 --> 16:43.582
- No doctor and no anesthesia.
- You're crazy.

16:43.750 --> 16:50.124
- Take a look. And it smells bad too.
- Excuse me!

16:51.208 --> 16:52.874
Okay, smile, no teeth!

16:53.041 --> 16:56.957
- Will Doula be in the water with you?
- No...

16:57.125 --> 17:01.957
- How come you're his best man?
- What do you mean? He asked me to.

17:02.125 --> 17:05.124
- ...mosquitoes bite at dusk.
- Can I have some of that?

17:05.290 --> 17:09.457
Let me spray her first.
Just a little bit.

17:10.540 --> 17:10.790
Thank you.

17:10.958 --> 17:13.374
Childbirth in a pool, in the dark,
it's ridiculous.

17:13.540 --> 17:16.040
- Leave them alone.
- He'll be swimming there with her?

17:16.208 --> 17:21.332
I'm sorry to bother you.
I just wanted to ask...

17:21.500 --> 17:25.457
- Now it's time to toast your parents...
- Where's the groom?

17:38.291 --> 17:39.499
Go, go, go.

17:41.916 --> 17:42.916
What are you doing?!

17:43.083 --> 17:44.540
- I'm on it.
- Move it!

17:44.750 --> 17:46.707
It's my decision.

17:46.875 --> 17:49.874
There'll be Chopin,
Doula will be massaging me...

17:50.083 --> 17:53.124
- There will be heated cherry pits...
- What's Chopin doing there?

17:53.333 --> 17:55.540
Playing. From the speakers.

17:56.583 --> 17:57.749
Here you go.

18:05.208 --> 18:06.208
Hello?

18:06.291 --> 18:08.249
Hello my ass.

18:08.625 --> 18:09.832
Who is this?

18:10.375 --> 18:12.249
The Angel of Vengeance.

18:12.541 --> 18:14.415
What the fuck, dude... who is this?

18:14.583 --> 18:15.583
Guess.

18:17.541 --> 18:20.957
Speed it up. What's your deal?
I can't talk right now.

18:21.875 --> 18:23.707
My deal is, that you're gone.

18:23.875 --> 18:24.665
What?

18:24.875 --> 18:28.040
- Because you're getting an air raid.
- What air raid?

18:28.208 --> 18:30.374
What do you think, you idiot?

18:30.875 --> 18:32.499
You work for a catering company.

18:32.666 --> 18:35.665
You have a wedding to get through today,
am I right?

18:36.791 --> 18:38.124
How do you know?

18:38.291 --> 18:40.374
I've been looking for you, my friend.

18:40.541 --> 18:42.290
You wrote it on your wall, I quote:

18:42.791 --> 18:45.124
"Another all-nighter today.
Hate this job."

18:45.291 --> 18:48.582
Watch out what you post on Facebook.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.249
What do you want?

18:50.750 --> 18:53.415
- I want you to apologize.
- For what?

18:53.833 --> 18:56.707
- For being a cocksucking douche.
- You're out of your fucking mind.

18:56.875 --> 19:01.124
Don't use voice deformation, you cunt.
Every kid knows how to do that voice.

19:01.291 --> 19:02.874
Later, dickhead.

19:05.916 --> 19:06.290
Hello?

19:06.750 --> 19:07.874
Then don't answer.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.749
He keeps asking about things.
I have to answer.

19:12.208 --> 19:13.874
Pretend you're asleep.

19:14.083 --> 19:14.874
Easy to say.

19:15.083 --> 19:18.374
Jesus, what am I supposed to do?

20:47.875 --> 20:49.874
Where the fuck have you been?
We're running late.

20:50.041 --> 20:54.540
- Can I use the Internet around here?
- How should I know? Ask the boss.

20:55.375 --> 20:56.582
- Plates!
- It'll melt.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.290
Put it in the freezer.

20:58.500 --> 21:02.999
- It's full.
- Boss, can I go online for a sec?

21:03.625 --> 21:04.625
What the heck for?

21:04.666 --> 21:06.165
I need to check something.

21:06.333 --> 21:06.915
Check what?

21:07.083 --> 21:09.040
This one important thing.

21:10.500 --> 21:10.999
Are you bored?

21:11.208 --> 21:13.290
No, boss, it's serious business.

21:13.458 --> 21:14.749
Are you bored?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Come on, boss...

21:17.166 --> 21:18.207
Answer my question.

21:18.416 --> 21:21.082
Hey boss, take it easy on him.

21:21.208 --> 21:23.040
I'm not talking to you.

21:24.666 --> 21:25.749
Answer me.

21:27.958 --> 21:29.332
I'm not bored.

21:29.541 --> 21:31.624
Maybe this is your wedding?

21:34.750 --> 21:35.415
No.

21:35.583 --> 21:38.624
No? it's not your wedding?
Then whose is it?

21:41.208 --> 21:42.208
Theirs.

21:42.375 --> 21:43.975
You're gonna stand here
talking bullshit?

21:44.083 --> 21:46.332
Or will you start serving the guests?
Now fuck off!

21:53.916 --> 21:55.665
"The clock is ticking."

21:56.625 --> 21:59.207
I want to kill people when I hear that.

21:59.416 --> 22:01.665
I know it's ticking.
It's ticking for everybody.

22:01.833 --> 22:04.415
And what if I don't want to have kids?

22:04.833 --> 22:07.415
Or I have nobody to have them with.

22:07.625 --> 22:09.999
"Well, you need to find someone."

22:10.375 --> 22:12.290
And that someone means anyone.

22:12.458 --> 22:14.999
He can be brainless,
as long as he's full of semen.

22:15.208 --> 22:18.832
And loaded. Ideal situation.

22:19.041 --> 22:22.624
Clever, sly, with tons of sperm,
a lifelong supply.

22:23.166 --> 22:26.790
Money and sperm. Yeah!

22:26.958 --> 22:28.915
Sorry, I'm rambling.

22:29.375 --> 22:31.832
Tell me, what have you been up to?

22:33.583 --> 22:35.707
Jesus, I forgot, sorry.

22:41.166 --> 22:43.290
- What's it for?
- My head.

22:43.708 --> 22:45.582
Anxiety, that sort of stuff.

22:45.750 --> 22:47.624
But it's really light.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.207
I don't feel the difference.

22:51.750 --> 22:54.082
I feel it when I stop taking it.
Want some?

22:55.208 --> 22:56.374
No, thanks.

22:58.750 --> 23:00.290
What have you got?

23:00.458 --> 23:01.582
Paroxetine.

23:01.750 --> 23:04.415
Been there, done that.
Now I'm on...

23:06.250 --> 23:07.540
I forgot the name.

23:07.708 --> 23:08.708
You?

23:08.833 --> 23:10.124
God, since when?

23:10.875 --> 23:13.040
Sorry, it's been a crazy day today.

23:15.250 --> 23:16.250
Bachelor party?

23:16.333 --> 23:17.874
Almost. Conference.

23:18.333 --> 23:19.832
Conference? What kind?

23:20.000 --> 23:23.790
Medical, I think...
Can I help you with anything else?

23:24.208 --> 23:26.040
And how would you like to help?

23:26.291 --> 23:29.457
- With another bottle of wine maybe?
- Then I guess you can help.

23:29.625 --> 23:31.374
- At least I need help.
- Me too.

24:04.541 --> 24:05.749
Help.

25:08.958 --> 25:11.207
- Jesus, Andrzej.
- Quiet, be quiet...

25:11.375 --> 25:13.415
I think I'm gonna die.

25:24.333 --> 25:26.374
I see you've already been served...

25:26.541 --> 25:28.082
One moment, please!

25:28.375 --> 25:30.374
Could we have that fresh ground pepper?

25:30.541 --> 25:32.415
Fresh ground, of course.

25:32.583 --> 25:36.415
- Where is he? it'll be cold.
- I asked for pepper.

25:37.041 --> 25:39.915
Pepper, pepper... the grainy one.

25:40.583 --> 25:42.707
It's called fresh ground pepper,
dumb-ass.

25:47.041 --> 25:48.707
Pepper for you, sir.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.374
Does he disappear often?

25:50.541 --> 25:52.790
- He'll be back in a sec.
- Not too often, I hope.

25:53.291 --> 25:54.707
Enough, enough.

25:55.500 --> 25:56.790
I'd like some, too.

25:56.958 --> 25:58.290
There you go.

25:58.916 --> 25:59.916
Thank you.

26:00.083 --> 26:02.957
- Jesus Christ...
- it's alright...

26:03.125 --> 26:05.017
- Do you have a towel or something?
- It's alright.

26:05.041 --> 26:06.374
It's good luck.

26:06.541 --> 26:09.665
I'll wipe it up, no worries.

26:09.833 --> 26:11.624
Could you bring me another glass?

26:11.791 --> 26:12.791
He'll bring a new one.

26:18.500 --> 26:19.582
It's over.

27:08.916 --> 27:09.916
What?

27:11.458 --> 27:13.457
I think this man is dead.

27:14.166 --> 27:16.332
What are you talking about?

27:22.750 --> 27:24.874
Poke him, maybe he's asleep.

27:25.791 --> 27:27.540
No, he's not asleep.

27:28.750 --> 27:30.332
His eyes are open.

27:38.958 --> 27:39.999
Be quiet!

27:40.708 --> 27:44.207
Shut up, you're making a scene.
We can't be sure yet.

27:44.458 --> 27:45.458
Quiet.

27:49.416 --> 27:51.207
Someone will come over.

27:51.750 --> 27:53.874
He'll be back. Don't worry.

27:54.791 --> 27:56.249
Why aren't you eating?

27:56.416 --> 27:59.040
I lost my appetite
along with the groom.

27:59.791 --> 28:00.874
Where is he?

28:01.041 --> 28:03.121
I don't know, mom.
Maybe he's on the phone somewhere.

28:03.208 --> 28:04.208
I meant the waiter.

28:04.708 --> 28:07.374
Okay, man... let's say
I do recognize you.

28:07.750 --> 28:09.540
You're Nemixar, right?

28:10.166 --> 28:15.499
We had a small misunderstanding once...
But come on, when was that? A year ago?

28:16.041 --> 28:18.832
We had an alliance, asshole. Remember?

28:19.625 --> 28:25.915
Actually no, I don't remember that.
Just that we had this stupid fight.

28:26.083 --> 28:29.999
You were supposed to send back up
and you attacked me yourself.

28:30.166 --> 28:33.707
But when was this, man. A year ago?

28:33.875 --> 28:36.915
Let's not fuck each other over now.

28:41.208 --> 28:43.165
We can figure out a new alliance.

28:43.375 --> 28:45.540
It's totally worth it, dude.

28:45.791 --> 28:47.999
You'll get plus five to diplomacy.

28:48.166 --> 28:49.957
Fuck diplomacy.

28:53.166 --> 28:56.207
Fine. This is my last offer.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.540
And I don't give a fuck after that.

29:00.041 --> 29:04.874
I'll give you a business deal
and monopoly on querkian mineral.

29:07.166 --> 29:08.332
Take it or leave it.

29:08.541 --> 29:09.957
What's your bet?

29:10.541 --> 29:11.541
What?

29:13.416 --> 29:15.040
What specialization?

29:15.833 --> 29:16.999
Urologists?

29:17.375 --> 29:18.624
No, too easy.

29:22.416 --> 29:24.374
Who gets it first, wins.

29:27.083 --> 29:28.707
- Oh fuck.
- What?

29:29.500 --> 29:30.957
- No, nothing...
- What?

29:31.125 --> 29:32.207
Don't turn around.

29:32.416 --> 29:34.790
This guy looks exactly like my ex.

29:34.958 --> 29:37.707
- Which one?
- Don't turn around!

29:39.000 --> 29:40.582
I'll tell you,
just don't turn around.

29:40.750 --> 29:42.332
- OK.
- I'll describe him to you...

29:42.500 --> 29:45.165
...and you'll turn around
as if looking at something else.

29:45.375 --> 29:46.375
Alright?

29:48.583 --> 29:49.957
- Shit!
- What?

29:50.208 --> 29:51.707
Don't turn around.

29:51.875 --> 29:52.915
It's him.

29:53.500 --> 29:54.500
Who?

29:56.291 --> 29:58.999
Animal behaviorists' conference. I win.

29:59.916 --> 30:01.665
We switch places as a reward.

30:01.833 --> 30:05.290
Come on, quick. Before he notices me.

30:12.166 --> 30:13.624
Which one is he?

30:14.833 --> 30:16.249
Sebastian Kamil.

30:17.666 --> 30:18.957
That's his name.

30:19.125 --> 30:21.832
Kamil
is his actual last name.

30:22.291 --> 30:23.832
God, that was bad.

30:24.708 --> 30:27.540
I even turned him into a serial killer.

30:27.833 --> 30:30.374
You haven't read it.
I mean it's not in print yet.

30:30.541 --> 30:31.582
Maybe September.

30:31.750 --> 30:34.332
"Friday night, Monday morning."
That's the title.

30:34.541 --> 30:37.415
Anyways, crazy stuff
happens in the end.

30:37.833 --> 30:38.833
As always.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.124
And I won't say another word.

30:41.291 --> 30:44.999
I don't want to ruin the surprise.
Maybe you'll read it.

30:45.166 --> 30:46.957
So you think this is a...

30:47.125 --> 30:49.374
An animal behaviorists' conference, yes.

30:49.541 --> 30:50.582
One hundred percent.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.665
Sorry. Want it back?

30:56.833 --> 30:58.415
No, help yourself.

30:58.625 --> 31:00.624
No, no... okay, last one.

31:11.625 --> 31:12.625
Answer.

31:13.916 --> 31:14.916
No.

31:21.541 --> 31:23.249
Maybe it's important.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.249
More important than me...

31:34.083 --> 31:35.999
Sorry, I have to call back.

31:37.208 --> 31:38.208
Okay.

31:39.041 --> 31:40.499
Go, leave me alone, you asshole.

31:41.541 --> 31:43.915
Just kidding! Go make that call.

31:53.291 --> 31:55.082
That bitch was very anxious.

31:55.666 --> 31:57.707
She was licking herself all over, man...

31:57.875 --> 31:59.665
And her owner couldn't grasp it.

31:59.833 --> 32:03.124
It's not a dog vs. dog issue,
it's about the dog vs. human.

32:03.291 --> 32:04.291
Women...

32:16.875 --> 32:18.374
Check his pulse.

32:18.833 --> 32:19.833
Jesus.

32:36.166 --> 32:37.166
And?

32:37.833 --> 32:39.915
How the fuck should I know?

32:40.166 --> 32:41.999
I don't feel anything.

32:42.166 --> 32:43.374
Do something.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.540
What am I supposed to do?

32:46.166 --> 32:48.207
I called for help, calm down.

32:48.416 --> 32:49.915
That was a rough ride, huh?

32:50.083 --> 32:52.540
Agatka's occupying the toilet...

32:54.041 --> 32:55.207
What is it?

32:55.875 --> 32:57.249
We think this man is dead.

32:57.500 --> 32:58.500
What?

32:58.666 --> 33:00.124
It seems like it.

33:01.708 --> 33:03.915
Did you check his pulse? And?

33:05.166 --> 33:06.707
See for yourself.

33:18.833 --> 33:19.833
Fuck.

33:20.250 --> 33:21.999
Stay calm, stay calm.

33:23.708 --> 33:25.624
Can't you sit somewhere else?

33:25.791 --> 33:26.915
Not really.

33:28.208 --> 33:30.040
It is pretty packed...

33:32.166 --> 33:33.415
Did you report this?

33:33.583 --> 33:35.582
I just called for someone.

33:38.541 --> 33:40.707
We're going to have to turn back.

33:40.875 --> 33:41.875
Turn back where?

33:42.000 --> 33:43.400
I don't know. To Cairo, Hurghada...

33:43.500 --> 33:45.832
To the closest airport. Protocol.

33:46.958 --> 33:50.707
- We have to go get someone.
- Calm down, don't panic.

33:50.875 --> 33:52.665
We've had enough adventures
for one day.

33:56.833 --> 33:57.833
Fuck...

33:58.791 --> 34:00.040
What happened?

34:02.416 --> 34:03.457
The Belgians.

34:04.916 --> 34:05.916
That's today?

34:08.416 --> 34:10.998
I'll have to cancel all the meetings.

34:11.750 --> 34:14.623
Hold on, maybe it'll go fast.

34:15.625 --> 34:17.623
No way, I don't think so.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.165
All those Arab procedures...

34:20.708 --> 34:22.831
Who, why, how did it happen?

34:25.791 --> 34:27.123
Besides, those are my seats.

34:28.916 --> 34:31.415
We'll have to explain everything.

34:35.083 --> 34:37.831
They'll think we switched on purpose.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.540
You could've sat through the whole
flight and not notice anything.

34:52.125 --> 34:54.165
He looks like he's asleep.

35:09.291 --> 35:10.624
There's that.

35:25.125 --> 35:27.999
- Where are you going?
- I have to use the bathroom.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.415
Turn that thing off.

36:09.625 --> 36:11.749
It's good shit.
My brother listens to that.

36:11.916 --> 36:13.832
Your brother is fucked up.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.540
You are fucked up.
My brother likes it and it's awesome.

36:18.708 --> 36:22.249
OK, got it, but can you turn it off?
I'm sick of it.

36:22.750 --> 36:23.999
What's wrong?

36:25.791 --> 36:28.749
Nothing. I'm having
these weird thoughts.

36:29.125 --> 36:33.124
You can't think about weird stuff,
you'll have a bad trip.

36:33.291 --> 36:34.374
Bad what?

36:36.208 --> 36:38.624
It's when you smoke too much...

36:38.916 --> 36:40.999
Can you turn this crap off?!

36:41.250 --> 36:42.624
Are you deaf?!

36:43.541 --> 36:45.082
Dude, what's up with you?

36:46.083 --> 36:47.999
Nothing. I feel worse from those...

36:48.166 --> 36:50.374
Cause you're freaking out
for no reason.

36:50.625 --> 36:52.124
You can't freak out.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.040
Does it hurt or something?

36:54.250 --> 36:56.040
What if it's coming back to me?

36:56.250 --> 36:57.250
What is?

36:58.583 --> 37:00.290
Karma.

37:00.458 --> 37:01.957
No way.

37:02.125 --> 37:07.124
You'd have to do something super bad
for it to come back like this.

37:08.416 --> 37:10.957
What if I did something super bad?

37:11.625 --> 37:13.832
Nah, what could you have done?

37:16.958 --> 37:18.124
What did you do?

37:26.041 --> 37:29.415
I'm a cocksucking fag.
There, I said it.

37:29.583 --> 37:32.332
- I lick my workmates' buttholes.
- I'm not saying that.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.874
I lick my workmates' buttholes.

37:36.500 --> 37:38.082
- You hear me?
- Okay, wait a second.

37:38.291 --> 37:43.165
Justa, this is the men's room!
See the urinals? Come on!

37:46.583 --> 37:48.874
Come on! Don't be scared!

37:49.041 --> 37:51.915
I lick my workmates' buttholes, happy?

37:54.166 --> 37:56.499
How much more have you got left?

37:56.666 --> 37:57.707
One more.

37:57.875 --> 37:59.957
Last one. it's the last one.

38:01.833 --> 38:03.374
Send me your face pic.

38:03.625 --> 38:04.625
What the fuck?!

38:04.791 --> 38:06.332
Fuck you, asshole!

38:06.500 --> 38:07.540
Fuck you!

38:08.958 --> 38:11.957
Ladies and gentlemen,
emotions are rising!

38:12.166 --> 38:15.249
And now, the bride and groom's
first dance.

38:15.750 --> 38:19.332
Let our groom sweep away
his beautiful swan to the dance floor...

38:23.291 --> 38:27.457
The first dance will take place
in a bit.

38:27.791 --> 38:32.332
Now, everybody is welcome to dance...

38:32.541 --> 38:34.624
...collectively, all together!

38:34.791 --> 38:36.499
Let the music reign!

38:45.416 --> 38:46.416
Hey...

38:46.833 --> 38:48.374
Yeah?

38:49.666 --> 38:52.540
I'm sorry, dude.
I got carried away. So?

38:53.708 --> 38:54.708
Look...

38:55.958 --> 38:59.082
if I do it we're even, right?

38:59.500 --> 39:00.500
Right.

39:01.208 --> 39:02.582
- For sure?
- Yeah.

39:02.750 --> 39:04.999
And then you'll screw me over anyway.

39:05.166 --> 39:06.707
I won't, promise.

39:07.791 --> 39:08.791
Swear.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
I swear.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.915
Swear on your fucking life.

39:15.083 --> 39:17.415
I swear on my life.

39:22.208 --> 39:23.208
Fine.

39:25.333 --> 39:26.874
Fine, wait a sec.

39:31.541 --> 39:33.249
There you fucking go.

39:35.416 --> 39:37.374
Sorry, I ate everything.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.249
I can get you something if you want.

39:39.500 --> 39:40.500
No need.

39:42.250 --> 39:43.415
How long was I gone?

39:43.625 --> 39:44.625
Two years.

39:44.833 --> 39:46.540
And fifteen minutes.

39:46.791 --> 39:48.915
I'm sorry, I had to take it.

39:49.750 --> 39:50.415
Something wrong?

39:50.583 --> 39:51.749
Never mind.

39:54.250 --> 39:56.707
Anyway, crisis averted.

39:57.750 --> 39:59.249
I don't get it...?

39:59.666 --> 40:00.666
My ex.

40:01.875 --> 40:05.707
- I won't get to meet him.
- I know, too bad. Maybe next time.

40:06.833 --> 40:09.124
Believe me, you don't want to meet him.

40:09.291 --> 40:12.040
Out of all my exes he was the worst,
even you were better.

40:12.208 --> 40:14.499
Just kidding. I mean you were...

40:14.666 --> 40:15.707
Whatever.

40:19.375 --> 40:21.540
It's really nice to see you.

40:24.666 --> 40:25.666
You too.

40:27.833 --> 40:29.915
Can I offer dessert?

40:30.166 --> 40:31.832
Yes, dessert, dessert!

40:32.041 --> 40:33.207
I'll pass, thank you.

40:33.416 --> 40:35.207
You don't want anything sweet?

40:35.375 --> 40:36.540
Not really.

40:36.708 --> 40:38.415
I'll be eating alone?

40:39.000 --> 40:41.207
What is a 'burning fantasy'?
I think that's about me.

40:41.416 --> 40:42.665
Ice cream topped with...

40:42.833 --> 40:43.957
Love it, having it.

40:44.333 --> 40:45.707
I'm alright.

40:52.500 --> 40:53.707
Are we good?

40:56.666 --> 40:57.874
Are we good?!

40:58.041 --> 40:59.999
Are we what?!

41:00.250 --> 41:02.499
Fuck! Are we good?!

41:02.875 --> 41:05.040
I did what you asked for!

41:05.750 --> 41:07.249
Change of plans.

41:07.541 --> 41:11.957
We had a deal, you fucking swore!

41:12.125 --> 41:14.790
You swore on your fucking life!

41:14.958 --> 41:17.124
You'll burn in hell, asshole.

41:20.125 --> 41:21.125
Are you there?

41:21.291 --> 41:22.790
Fuck off.

41:25.458 --> 41:26.458
Fuck!

41:27.416 --> 41:28.999
Shit, shit, shit...

41:37.875 --> 41:39.040
Excuse me...

41:39.500 --> 41:43.499
About the... fireworks show.

41:44.125 --> 41:47.874
It can't take place
close to the building.

41:48.541 --> 41:49.874
You're joking.

41:50.333 --> 41:51.333
I'm not.

41:52.125 --> 41:54.249
Object regulations changed.

41:54.500 --> 41:57.790
We can't have them here
due to fire safety rules.

41:57.958 --> 42:00.374
But there's a lovely clearing...

42:02.041 --> 42:04.165
...about three hundred meters away.

42:04.333 --> 42:07.540
There's a path, it's almost paved.

42:07.708 --> 42:10.624
What do you mean it's
almost paved?

42:11.708 --> 42:14.249
It means you can almost walk on it.

42:16.666 --> 42:19.165
It was a stupid joke. I apologize.

42:20.083 --> 42:22.540
Thank you, I'm not drinking yet.

42:23.666 --> 42:27.457
- I'll take care of this, don't worry.
- Thank you.

42:27.625 --> 42:29.082
Safety first...

42:29.291 --> 42:31.207
I called you because...

42:34.583 --> 42:36.124
I wanted to talk.

42:36.666 --> 42:38.207
You surprised me.

42:38.666 --> 42:40.832
I mean, I wanted to call you myself,

42:41.000 --> 42:43.415
but I didn't know how you'd react,

42:43.583 --> 42:45.832
if you'd still hold
a grudge against me.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Why?

42:49.250 --> 42:50.250
Because of everything.

42:50.375 --> 42:52.040
Because I left you.

42:52.541 --> 42:54.832
There's nothing to talk about.

42:55.250 --> 42:57.249
I knew you wouldn't be mad.

42:57.458 --> 43:01.207
I was just scared
it would be weird, uncomfortable...

43:04.500 --> 43:05.582
But now...

43:06.291 --> 43:09.457
...I feel like nothing's changed.

43:10.583 --> 43:11.790
Some things changed.

43:11.958 --> 43:15.540
Of course, some things changed.
That's a good thing.

43:16.500 --> 43:21.249
Don't you feel like we were just kids,
who had no idea what they wanted?

43:22.250 --> 43:23.665
At least I was.

43:29.666 --> 43:31.249
But I think now...

43:32.625 --> 43:35.332
I'm ready for a serious relationship.

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Me too.

43:53.458 --> 43:55.124
I'm seeing someone.

44:00.458 --> 44:03.415
Why didn't you say anything?

44:04.666 --> 44:06.624
That's good, right?

44:08.291 --> 44:09.291
Great.

44:20.708 --> 44:22.582
I think it's time to...

44:28.250 --> 44:29.749
...settle our affairs.

44:32.875 --> 44:36.082
Do you know what I mean?

44:36.250 --> 44:37.374
Yeah, sure.

44:40.708 --> 44:43.582
Actually no, not really.

44:48.208 --> 44:50.582
I want to ask you for a divorce.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Oh no.

44:53.625 --> 44:54.957
Just kidding.

44:55.208 --> 44:59.249
God, I forgot about that.
These things never mattered to me.

45:00.166 --> 45:02.957
Isn't this a long process?

45:03.083 --> 45:04.249
Actually no.

45:04.500 --> 45:06.332
Only if you have kids.

45:07.666 --> 45:12.374
We just need to file for divorce
without apportioning blame.

45:13.083 --> 45:15.124
Plus one trip to the court.

45:15.375 --> 45:16.375
That's it.

45:16.541 --> 45:19.249
Do you want to meet, talk it over...

45:20.333 --> 45:21.832
There's no need.

45:23.708 --> 45:26.832
- I don't get it.
- I brought the application with me.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.832
- You want your briefcase?
- Please.

46:22.833 --> 46:23.833
Kama?

46:58.250 --> 47:00.040
Justa gave me your address.

47:00.208 --> 47:01.208
Justa?

47:02.333 --> 47:04.790
I talked to Kaśka.
She said you're crushed.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
To Kaśka?

47:07.041 --> 47:08.957
How are you holding up?

47:10.666 --> 47:12.040
Fine, I guess.

47:21.791 --> 47:24.915
How long were you with Witek?

47:28.583 --> 47:31.165
I don't know. Like three months...?

47:31.708 --> 47:34.249
What was it? Second, third grade?

47:35.916 --> 47:36.916
Third.

47:45.958 --> 47:49.499
I split up with Marcin, too.

47:50.791 --> 47:51.791
Too bad.

47:53.125 --> 47:56.124
Just now. Like three weeks ago.

47:58.166 --> 48:01.082
We were together
since third grade, too.

48:08.708 --> 48:10.499
Things got fucked up, huh?

48:10.666 --> 48:11.666
Yeah.

48:12.666 --> 48:20.666
I tell myself that these things happen
to make place for something better.

48:21.208 --> 48:25.290
That our fate is written in the...
Wait.

48:26.458 --> 48:29.332
Justa is texting me,
she wants to come.

48:29.583 --> 48:30.583
What?

48:30.625 --> 48:32.499
What should I tell her?

48:32.750 --> 48:33.750
Wait.

48:40.041 --> 48:41.915
We're just hanging out.

48:48.083 --> 48:49.374
Where are you?

48:50.208 --> 48:51.374
It's Kaśka.

48:52.166 --> 48:56.374
No, it's like... five minutes away.

49:01.791 --> 49:03.540
No, I just came here.

49:07.083 --> 49:08.915
She's fine, I guess...

49:11.375 --> 49:13.665
Okay, I'll pass her the phone.

49:13.833 --> 49:15.915
Kama, Kaśka wants to talk.

49:16.583 --> 49:18.457
Take it, I need to pee.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.707
Where's the bathroom?

49:24.250 --> 49:25.250
Hello?

49:25.416 --> 49:26.790
Hey girl, how are you?

49:28.000 --> 49:30.915
- I'm alright.
- Terrible, huh?

49:31.083 --> 49:32.374
I don't think I can make it.

49:32.541 --> 49:35.332
- That's too bad.
- This is like total insanity.

49:35.500 --> 49:38.832
I heard he shot himself
because of his dad.

49:39.958 --> 49:41.124
Don't know.

49:41.625 --> 49:45.540
Gośka said his father was a cop,
that's why he had a gun.

49:46.750 --> 49:47.790
What do you think?

49:48.375 --> 49:51.040
- About what?
- Was his father really a cop?

49:53.583 --> 49:54.999
- I don't know.
- Or his mother...

49:55.166 --> 49:57.207
Don't you remember anything?

49:57.375 --> 49:58.582
I don't know.

49:59.041 --> 50:05.165
Well then... kisses, I gotta run. Bye.

50:09.083 --> 50:10.083
Who is it?

50:10.125 --> 50:10.790
Justa.

50:11.041 --> 50:12.041
Pick up.

50:13.041 --> 50:13.874
Hello?

50:14.041 --> 50:17.582
- What's the apartment number?
- 115.

50:23.333 --> 50:24.333
Yes?

50:25.541 --> 50:26.790
Ela, open up.

50:29.791 --> 50:31.207
Open the door, please.

50:37.958 --> 50:38.958
Listen.

50:40.583 --> 50:44.165
Let's wait half an hour, okay?

50:44.708 --> 50:46.790
Half an hour won't change anything.

50:47.041 --> 50:49.540
If we pass Budapest,
we'll go straight to Warsaw.

50:49.708 --> 50:52.249
They won't turn the plane around.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.749
We can switch seats if you want.
I'll sit next to him.

50:59.083 --> 51:00.083
Please.

51:00.791 --> 51:03.374
He wanted to fly to Warsaw, right?

51:03.583 --> 51:05.665
Maybe someone's waiting for him there.

51:05.833 --> 51:09.040
They'll leave him God knows where,
people will be looking for him.

51:09.208 --> 51:10.749
You'll have to explain what happened.

51:10.958 --> 51:13.249
And did you see what happened?

51:13.916 --> 51:15.040
You saw shit.

51:15.208 --> 51:17.040
And now we can do shit about it.

51:17.250 --> 51:19.290
We can only make it worse.

51:27.583 --> 51:28.665
I beg you.

51:30.541 --> 51:32.499
You gave him my sunglasses.

51:32.666 --> 51:33.666
Jesus.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.290
'Gave', what do you mean 'gave'?!

51:39.333 --> 51:43.082
Could you think about someone
other than yourself for a change?

51:43.291 --> 51:46.082
About me? Think about me,
how I feel sometimes!

52:18.000 --> 52:20.165
What is it?

52:20.458 --> 52:24.374
This is your aunt!
And this is your other aunt!

52:28.875 --> 52:31.332
He was so tiny when we last met.

52:32.041 --> 52:36.124
Pass the bottle, I need to feed him.
It's in the stroller. Please.

52:36.333 --> 52:37.540
It's okay...

52:39.500 --> 52:41.207
Hey, I'm hungry too.

52:41.666 --> 52:45.499
- Look. What do we have there...
- Lets order something.

52:46.166 --> 52:48.124
I can't, I eat too much.

52:48.416 --> 52:49.124
Kama?

52:49.333 --> 52:50.415
No, thanks.

52:50.791 --> 52:53.332
Mommy's here.
What do you want to order?

52:53.500 --> 52:55.457
- Thai maybe?
- I can't.

52:55.708 --> 52:56.708
Sushi?

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
Are you crazy?

52:58.458 --> 52:59.458
Pizza.

53:00.083 --> 53:01.083
Will do.

53:01.416 --> 53:02.540
Well, Kama?

53:04.125 --> 53:05.374
Cheating day?

53:08.083 --> 53:09.874
And everybody's happy.

53:11.541 --> 53:12.332
What are you doing?

53:12.541 --> 53:13.541
I'm ordering pizza.

53:13.625 --> 53:14.749
I'll do it.

53:18.750 --> 53:20.207
Okay, spill it.

53:20.625 --> 53:22.290
Are you seeing anyone?

53:25.166 --> 53:26.166
No.

53:26.416 --> 53:27.832
Nobody, nothing?

53:28.375 --> 53:29.665
No, I'm not seeing anyone.

53:30.958 --> 53:33.707
- Well what are you up to these days?
- Now?

53:36.541 --> 53:38.207
I'm talking to you.

53:39.750 --> 53:41.915
I'm serious, what do you do?

53:43.250 --> 53:44.250
I work.

53:44.875 --> 53:45.875
Where?

53:48.458 --> 53:49.707
In a company.

53:50.541 --> 53:51.541
What kind?

53:52.583 --> 53:53.874
I told you...

53:55.583 --> 53:56.583
Don't remember.

53:56.708 --> 53:58.499
Jesus, we talked about it.

53:58.666 --> 54:00.290
It's the same company.

54:03.083 --> 54:04.624
Is it some kind of a secret?

54:04.791 --> 54:06.624
No, it's not a secret.

54:07.291 --> 54:09.624
Fences, right? You make fences.

54:15.375 --> 54:16.624
Among other things.

54:16.791 --> 54:17.874
What else?

54:21.541 --> 54:22.624
Lots of stuff.

54:26.291 --> 54:27.291
Fences,

54:30.625 --> 54:31.832
balustrades,

54:34.958 --> 54:36.499
entrance gates...

54:38.166 --> 54:39.540
...exit gates,

54:41.375 --> 54:42.415
railings,

54:45.250 --> 54:46.250
posts.

54:48.333 --> 54:51.332
But we make the biggest profit
on fences.

54:58.166 --> 54:59.957
What do you have there?

55:00.125 --> 55:01.290
What are you hiding?

55:01.833 --> 55:07.249
Vesuvio. Mozzarella,
capers, arugula...

55:07.458 --> 55:10.290
- Prosciutto, anchovies...
- Oh, yeah!

55:25.541 --> 55:29.457
Irretrievable breakdown of marriage.
I put it down here.

55:30.416 --> 55:32.915
Less complications in court later.

55:35.083 --> 55:37.540
You can read this part over here.

55:38.500 --> 55:40.165
Here.

55:44.333 --> 55:47.290
Sounds serious,
all this legal language.

55:49.833 --> 55:51.540
Should I sign it now?

55:51.916 --> 55:53.290
That would be best.

55:54.208 --> 55:59.999
- Unless you have any doubts.
- No, it's all good.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
Wait.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
Here?

56:22.666 --> 56:23.957
Who is it for?

56:26.666 --> 56:28.707
I never gave you an autograph.

56:28.875 --> 56:31.832
Tell me the name: Maria,
Magdalena, Patrycja?

56:32.958 --> 56:33.958
Wiktoria.

56:34.458 --> 56:35.707
For Wiktoria.

56:51.250 --> 56:52.250
Oh God.

56:54.458 --> 56:55.458
OK.

57:03.291 --> 57:04.707
What does Wiktoria do?

57:04.875 --> 57:06.540
What's her profession?

57:06.750 --> 57:07.915
Same as me.

57:08.625 --> 57:10.957
Sociology.

57:11.416 --> 57:13.290
Where did you two meet?

57:14.333 --> 57:15.082
University?

57:15.250 --> 57:17.249
Teacher or student? No...

57:17.708 --> 57:21.290
Fourth... fifth year.
She started late.

57:24.541 --> 57:27.707
Wedding already planned?

57:29.416 --> 57:30.665
In September.

57:32.833 --> 57:36.290
That's fast.
Is there a baby on the way?

57:37.208 --> 57:38.415
Third month.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.499
Great, congratulations.

57:43.708 --> 57:46.249
Wait, so it will be... not yet...

57:47.375 --> 57:48.707
Born in October.

57:50.458 --> 57:51.458
Exactly.

57:52.541 --> 57:54.749
You didn't want to have kids.

57:58.541 --> 58:00.332
You didn't want kids.

58:02.250 --> 58:03.290
Excuse me.

58:09.708 --> 58:11.749
That's not all. Careful...

58:22.541 --> 58:27.915
Who told me tales
When I went to bed

58:30.541 --> 58:36.624
Who picked lilac bouquets
In the month of May

58:39.083 --> 58:45.124
Who forgave every time
all those fights and mistakes

58:46.833 --> 58:53.540
When I quietly cried
in my hiding place.

58:55.166 --> 59:02.707
This image to this day
Helps me sleep in gloom

59:04.166 --> 59:10.874
Dad was young just like May
And my mom all in bloom...

59:11.541 --> 59:19.124
My parents are simply great
My parents are simply great

59:19.875 --> 59:27.124
They showed me which way to go,
which road to take

59:28.416 --> 59:34.957
My parents are simply great
They're really my closest friends

59:35.833 --> 59:43.082
They told me one sunny day:
go your own way

59:44.416 --> 59:51.540
Now I'm on my own,
But I know all the roads

59:53.083 --> 59:55.540
They will always be close...

59:57.500 --> 59:58.540
Say hello.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.540
Kapsel, Jabba, come inside, come.

01:00:07.875 --> 01:00:08.915
Say hello.

01:00:09.333 --> 01:00:10.499
Come quick.

01:00:16.083 --> 01:00:17.624
Wait, the phone...

01:00:19.125 --> 01:00:20.125
Diana, wait.

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:21.750
Hello?

01:00:21.833 --> 01:00:24.457
Hi mommy, are you at home?

01:00:25.041 --> 01:00:26.915
Miłosz? Aren't you at the wedding?

01:00:27.166 --> 01:00:29.249
I am, I have a favor to ask you.

01:00:29.416 --> 01:00:30.416
Are you at home?

01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:31.583
Yes.

01:00:32.416 --> 01:00:33.707
Go to my room.

01:00:34.333 --> 01:00:35.333
What for?

01:00:35.375 --> 01:00:36.665
Mom! Just go.

01:00:38.041 --> 01:00:39.499
I can't right now.

01:00:39.666 --> 01:00:40.666
Why not?

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:42.290
Because I'm busy.

01:00:42.833 --> 01:00:45.415
Jesus, don't make me angry.

01:00:46.291 --> 01:00:47.707
Are you walking?

01:00:49.291 --> 01:00:49.999
Are you?

01:00:50.166 --> 01:00:55.832
- Yes, yes. Stop yelling, Jesus Christ.
- Go to my computer, open it, it's on.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.665
Just touch the mouse
and it will turn on.

01:00:57.833 --> 01:00:59.124
Are you done?

01:00:59.875 --> 01:01:02.415
Can't this wait?

01:01:02.916 --> 01:01:03.582
No.

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:05.999
There's a User Name sign
at the bottom.

01:01:06.166 --> 01:01:10.915
Click on it and type "QUASAR11".

01:01:12.458 --> 01:01:13.499
What does it mean?

01:01:13.666 --> 01:01:15.665
It doesn't mean anything.

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.124
- I'll spell it for you.
- Jabba, stop.

01:01:19.416 --> 01:01:21.374
Q like Q...

01:01:22.125 --> 01:01:23.457
Jabba, enough!

01:01:23.791 --> 01:01:25.082
Do you hear me?!

01:01:25.291 --> 01:01:26.291
Yes, I hear you.

01:01:26.333 --> 01:01:28.207
- Then start typing.
- I am.

01:01:28.375 --> 01:01:30.082
Q, like the letter Q.

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:36.457
Then U, A, then S, A, R like Robert

01:01:37.375 --> 01:01:40.915
and the number 11 in the end.
Did you write it down?

01:01:41.291 --> 01:01:45.790
And now the password.
And the password is "cocksucker."

01:01:47.416 --> 01:01:48.499
Excuse me?

01:01:48.666 --> 01:01:50.707
It's just a password, mom.

01:01:50.916 --> 01:01:52.499
Congratulations, very funny.

01:01:52.666 --> 01:01:54.249
Everybody has these funny passwords.

01:01:54.416 --> 01:01:55.790
Yeah, it's hilarious.

01:01:56.166 --> 01:01:59.290
I just said it that way.
Funny, weird, fuck!

01:02:01.333 --> 01:02:03.915
- Whatever!
- Is everything alright?

01:02:04.125 --> 01:02:05.499
Yes. Mom, I beg you.

01:02:06.666 --> 01:02:09.582
- Did you write it down?
- "Cocksucker."

01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:12.040
Click ENTER when you're done.

01:02:13.625 --> 01:02:14.332
Enter?

01:02:14.541 --> 01:02:20.582
It's on the right side of the keyboard,
with a turning arrow on it.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.790
- I know what 'enter' means!
- Great. What do you see?

01:02:26.083 --> 01:02:27.083
Planets.

01:02:27.208 --> 01:02:27.540
Great.

01:02:27.708 --> 01:02:31.915
You should see this large sign
that says YOUR EMPIRE, do you have it?

01:02:32.458 --> 01:02:32.790
Yes.

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:33.958
Awesome.

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:36.500
Good.

01:02:37.916 --> 01:02:39.165
Good, great.

01:02:40.041 --> 01:02:43.499
Now you need to find the radar.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.832
I'm sorry, what time is it?

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:34.332
- Fourteen past six.
- Less than an hour and we're back home.

01:04:27.666 --> 01:04:28.707
Thank you.

01:04:34.833 --> 01:04:35.833
Crap...

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:45.874
Just a sip.

01:04:56.416 --> 01:04:57.874
I made it myself.

01:05:05.375 --> 01:05:09.082
- And? Any good?
- Very good. Thank you.

01:05:35.666 --> 01:05:36.666
Why not?

01:05:40.041 --> 01:05:41.874
Now you're telling me?!

01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:46.457
OK, I won't say a word.

01:05:47.291 --> 01:05:48.291
Fine.

01:05:55.916 --> 01:05:56.916
Who is it?

01:05:57.125 --> 01:06:00.374
I wasn't supposed to make it,

01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:03.457
but I thought that
if we don't do this now

01:06:03.625 --> 01:06:05.832
then when would we meet
in the same squad?

01:06:06.041 --> 01:06:07.249
Hello, baby.

01:06:08.166 --> 01:06:09.874
Did you buy anything?

01:06:10.125 --> 01:06:11.707
- It's nothing.
- Show me.

01:06:11.916 --> 01:06:13.249
Where's Kama?

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.180
- In the bathroom.
- I just talked to Wika.

01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:17.374
She asked me
not to mention the wedding.

01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:18.249
The what?

01:06:18.416 --> 01:06:19.082
The wedding.

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:20.250
What wedding?

01:06:20.333 --> 01:06:21.082
Louder, go ahead.

01:06:21.291 --> 01:06:22.291
What wedding?

01:06:22.375 --> 01:06:24.457
THE wedding,
what wedding could she mean!

01:06:24.625 --> 01:06:25.165
Why not?

01:06:25.333 --> 01:06:26.624
I think she didn't invite her.

01:06:26.791 --> 01:06:29.374
But like didn't invite her at all
or didn't invite her yet?

01:06:29.541 --> 01:06:33.207
At all, yet, I don't know.
Let's just not talk about it.

01:06:33.666 --> 01:06:36.915
Hi! I'm so glad you're here.

01:06:37.083 --> 01:06:38.499
Long time no see.

01:06:39.083 --> 01:06:42.290
I talked to Wika,
she won't make it but she says hi.

01:06:42.458 --> 01:06:43.249
Too bad.

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:46.915
She said you're leaving tomorrow,
so I thought now or never!

01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:49.165
Kama, where are you going?

01:06:51.166 --> 01:06:52.290
That's yours?

01:06:52.458 --> 01:06:56.374
- What did you buy?
- It's this... it was an impulse buy.

01:06:56.833 --> 01:06:58.665
Nice. Going somewhere?

01:06:59.458 --> 01:07:00.707
Terrible, huh?

01:07:01.541 --> 01:07:04.665
Maciek called, I was in
the dressing room practically naked.

01:07:04.833 --> 01:07:07.249
I forgot why I even went in there.

01:07:07.416 --> 01:07:09.290
A fucking gun, feel it?

01:07:10.166 --> 01:07:11.166
A gun.

01:07:12.041 --> 01:07:13.665
I don't even want to think
who found him.

01:07:13.833 --> 01:07:14.915
His brother, apparently.

01:07:15.125 --> 01:07:16.582
He had a brother?

01:07:16.791 --> 01:07:17.791
He did.

01:07:17.833 --> 01:07:18.999
Kama, where are you going?

01:07:19.166 --> 01:07:23.790
He did, he did,
he did... have a brother.

01:07:28.166 --> 01:07:29.540
Wojtek, I think...

01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:31.250
Wojtek.

01:07:31.791 --> 01:07:34.624
- Sounds just like Witek.
- Older or younger?

01:07:34.791 --> 01:07:36.499
Sounds like younger.

01:07:36.708 --> 01:07:37.832
Younger, younger...

01:07:38.041 --> 01:07:39.707
I mean older, older.

01:07:40.833 --> 01:07:43.082
That's better.
He'll cope with it better.

01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:46.332
To see something like that...
it can fuck you up for life.

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.374
You won't forget this.

01:07:49.041 --> 01:07:52.165
Un-fucking-believable.

01:07:55.708 --> 01:07:58.332
Should he be crawling around the floor?

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:02.499
Please, if I were to stress over
everything he puts in his mouth...

01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:05.624
He'll get his hands all dirty.

01:08:06.125 --> 01:08:09.415
That's actually a natural antibiotic.
He'll toughen up...

01:08:09.541 --> 01:08:10.790
Kama, how did you find out?

01:08:10.958 --> 01:08:11.958
- About what?
- Witek.

01:08:12.125 --> 01:08:13.582
Wiktoria told me.

01:08:14.083 --> 01:08:16.040
It's because I told her.

01:08:17.125 --> 01:08:21.915
I called her, shit, I'm so sorry.
I was sure you already knew.

01:08:22.707 --> 01:08:25.082
I mean you two were close, right?

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:26.499
Not really, no.

01:08:26.666 --> 01:08:29.582
Then again I thought you should
find out from someone from the family.

01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:31.040
Like his brother.

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:32.207
I don't even know him.

01:08:32.332 --> 01:08:35.290
I saw him once or twice.

01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:39.249
I don't even remember
what he looks like.

01:08:39.416 --> 01:08:40.582
Who? Wojtek?

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:41.457
Witek.

01:08:41.625 --> 01:08:43.249
He had curly hair.

01:08:43.457 --> 01:08:46.457
Wojtek, Wojtek... I got mixed up.

01:08:46.625 --> 01:08:47.665
Kama, where are you going?

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:50.082
To South America!
I bought a fucking ticket, I'm going!

01:08:50.291 --> 01:08:53.707
Do I have to explain myself
to each and every one of you?!

01:08:59.707 --> 01:09:00.707
Chill.

01:09:02.666 --> 01:09:03.707
Chill out.

01:09:08.375 --> 01:09:09.915
I was just curious.

01:09:23.457 --> 01:09:25.040
Where to, exactly?

01:09:28.375 --> 01:09:29.415
To Chile.

01:09:34.707 --> 01:09:37.624
Hey, it's all good, girl.

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:43.457
Don't even bother about the funeral.

01:09:45.082 --> 01:09:47.249
Don't let it ruin your trip.

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:53.040
The guy has only himself to blame.

01:09:54.041 --> 01:09:55.082
Fuck that.

01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:58.415
I'm not sure I'd go, either.

01:09:59.541 --> 01:10:00.999
If I were you...

01:10:01.416 --> 01:10:02.040
"Oh no, my friend!"

01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:04.970
"if you had the courage to do it,
then I'm sorry, but fuck you, man!"

01:10:05.125 --> 01:10:08.249
Every man for himself.
You're the one who pulls the trigger.

01:10:08.416 --> 01:10:12.249
And all that bullshit, that people
don't know what they're doing...

01:10:12.416 --> 01:10:15.707
Even if he took something,
it's his decision to do it. Whatever!

01:10:15.875 --> 01:10:20.874
It always begins with your choice,
even if it's subconscious.

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:22.750
Simple.

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:25.249
It's not your fault.

01:10:28.541 --> 01:10:29.541
Andrzej?

01:10:32.125 --> 01:10:33.499
I got it right?

01:10:35.375 --> 01:10:36.415
Andrzej.

01:10:36.916 --> 01:10:38.165
I'm kidding.

01:10:40.083 --> 01:10:42.249
I heard it somewhere before.

01:10:42.875 --> 01:10:45.499
When you were talking to your wife.

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:55.665
Sebastian.

01:10:56.458 --> 01:10:57.458
Kamil.

01:10:57.833 --> 01:10:58.833
Andrzej.

01:11:04.291 --> 01:11:06.832
Could I try to guess
your astrological sign?

01:11:07.041 --> 01:11:09.415
It's hard, but sometimes I get it right.

01:11:14.625 --> 01:11:15.707
Capricorn?

01:11:19.416 --> 01:11:20.416
Bingo.

01:11:21.708 --> 01:11:25.290
Not sure about the month, though,
January or December...

01:11:25.458 --> 01:11:27.290
January or December...

01:11:32.333 --> 01:11:33.333
January.

01:11:33.791 --> 01:11:37.165
I haven't thought about it for months
and it came back now...

01:11:37.333 --> 01:11:38.665
...and it's already winter!

01:11:38.833 --> 01:11:40.415
Then call the guy.

01:11:40.583 --> 01:11:41.874
Tell him you're sorry.

01:11:42.041 --> 01:11:43.915
I'm not calling anyone.

01:11:44.416 --> 01:11:45.416
I'm serious.

01:11:45.541 --> 01:11:47.457
I'm not calling anyone!

01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:07.290
What did you write to him?

01:12:09.208 --> 01:12:12.290
"I'm sorry".
What was I supposed to write?

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:18.499
Are you feeling better?

01:12:25.458 --> 01:12:27.457
I think it's coming back.

01:12:42.333 --> 01:12:43.915
Hey, what the fuck?

01:12:45.208 --> 01:12:46.290
What's going on?

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:35.457
How much time left
to pilot recruitment?

01:13:35.833 --> 01:13:36.915
Six months.

01:13:37.166 --> 01:13:39.832
Not in game time, in real time.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.082
Okay, wait. 5 minutes, 27 seconds.

01:13:45.208 --> 01:13:49.082
Find our chasers, those green dots.

01:13:50.333 --> 01:13:51.165
There are none.

01:13:51.333 --> 01:13:52.707
What do you mean none?

01:13:52.916 --> 01:13:54.624
I see only red dots.

01:13:55.125 --> 01:13:56.290
Mom, focus.

01:13:57.250 --> 01:13:58.290
They're not here.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:59.832
Did you send them out?

01:14:00.041 --> 01:14:01.374
I'm doing everything you say.

01:14:01.541 --> 01:14:04.915
You're not! if you were,
we wouldn't be in this mess!

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:08.457
Do you see a red sign anywhere?

01:14:08.625 --> 01:14:11.249
Yes: no resources.

01:14:12.708 --> 01:14:13.708
Fuck.

01:14:14.833 --> 01:14:17.415
Why didn't you tell me
he took over the mines?!

01:14:18.791 --> 01:14:21.707
I didn't know,
how should I know where...

01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:24.374
Can't you just turn this game off?

01:14:24.541 --> 01:14:26.374
You can't turn it off!

01:14:26.541 --> 01:14:28.082
What do you mean you can't?

01:14:28.291 --> 01:14:30.374
You can't! You have to play
all the time!

01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:33.374
All the time, how? This never ends?

01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:34.750
Exactly!

01:14:35.375 --> 01:14:36.375
Please!

01:14:36.583 --> 01:14:39.082
Why don't you ever fucking listen?!

01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:42.457
I'm listening, all the time!

01:14:42.625 --> 01:14:44.874
You never do what I ask you to do!

01:14:45.083 --> 01:14:48.040
You never fucking listen!
You never did!

01:14:48.208 --> 01:14:51.624
If this goes wrong,
it'll be your fucking fault!

01:14:51.958 --> 01:14:53.165
Your fault!

01:15:09.666 --> 01:15:11.290
Now it's your turn.

01:15:12.625 --> 01:15:13.707
Excuse me?

01:15:14.708 --> 01:15:16.499
Guess! What's my sign?

01:15:19.541 --> 01:15:21.082
I'm sorry, I don't know.

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.707
Don't think about it, just shoot.

01:15:24.833 --> 01:15:26.290
I don't know...

01:15:28.791 --> 01:15:29.791
Scorpio?

01:15:32.541 --> 01:15:33.624
That hurt.

01:15:37.416 --> 01:15:38.582
I'm kidding.

01:15:39.541 --> 01:15:41.582
But if you say Cancer, it's over!

01:15:43.875 --> 01:15:45.082
Just joking.

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:49.457
Could be Cancer,
I'm not giving any hints.

01:15:50.541 --> 01:15:52.915
But it's not, there you have it.

01:15:54.625 --> 01:15:56.499
You know what, I'm a bit tired.

01:15:56.708 --> 01:15:58.457
I'll give you a hint.

01:15:58.625 --> 01:15:59.915
No, no, no, thank you.

01:16:00.125 --> 01:16:01.499
But it's easy, I promise...

01:16:01.666 --> 01:16:03.457
I don't want to play.

01:16:07.833 --> 01:16:10.165
I'm sorry, I won't say a word.

01:16:20.791 --> 01:16:25.624
I'm kidding, I can just tell you.
It's no secret!

01:16:30.583 --> 01:16:33.249
I really don't feel well.

01:16:35.166 --> 01:16:37.082
It's not because of my alcohol, I hope.

01:16:37.625 --> 01:16:38.625
No, no.

01:16:40.125 --> 01:16:43.915
I was afraid I gave you the wrong flask.

01:16:48.083 --> 01:16:51.624
Your face... you were terrified!

01:16:52.458 --> 01:16:56.499
I see those things. Perks of my job.

01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:59.374
I'm a behaviorist.

01:17:03.458 --> 01:17:05.582
Don't get up, you can't now.

01:17:05.791 --> 01:17:08.374
We'll find you a bag or something.

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:11.915
Now you really got me worried.

01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:14.874
I don't believe this.
You must've eaten something!

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:46.707
Jesus, mom, I'm sorry.

01:17:49.541 --> 01:17:56.582
Everything's going great, just focus.

01:17:58.875 --> 01:17:59.875
Mom?

01:18:01.666 --> 01:18:03.040
Are you there?

01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:06.790
I'm here.

01:18:07.708 --> 01:18:12.874
Let's do this, OK? Keep going.

01:18:14.125 --> 01:18:15.915
Click on the resources.

01:18:16.375 --> 01:18:22.499
Click on that drill thingy.
That big one at the bottom.

01:18:23.041 --> 01:18:24.790
A table should pop up.

01:18:24.958 --> 01:18:30.499
Tell me where's the biggest number?

01:18:33.416 --> 01:18:34.499
Next to...

01:18:36.333 --> 01:18:39.082
Mom? Did you click on it?

01:18:42.833 --> 01:18:48.082
Maybe at one point you're just done.

01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:53.499
The last drop spills,
the only thing left is despair.

01:18:55.875 --> 01:18:58.499
And you'd rather there was nothing.

01:18:59.041 --> 01:19:07.041
Because what is, is so totally horrible,
that you'd rather...

01:19:08.833 --> 01:19:10.582
You'd rather choose nothing.

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.915
I can't imagine myself not existing.

01:19:16.666 --> 01:19:20.165
Me neither. I don't get it.

01:19:21.833 --> 01:19:23.249
What does it feel like?

01:19:23.416 --> 01:19:25.374
You don't feel anything.

01:19:26.583 --> 01:19:29.082
The only thing left is your body.

01:19:29.333 --> 01:19:30.707
That's not true.

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:35.165
There's consciousness.

01:19:37.208 --> 01:19:38.290
Or energy.

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:44.082
I don't give a shit about energy,
if I don't have anyone close.

01:19:45.833 --> 01:19:48.832
When you know you're gone,
that's creepy.

01:19:57.375 --> 01:19:58.790
Please, go away.

01:20:11.416 --> 01:20:18.165
Fuck! Just leave! I'm begging you!

01:20:41.833 --> 01:20:43.832
How much time do we have?

01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:46.207
15 minutes, 25 seconds.

01:20:46.541 --> 01:20:48.207
How many ships on the orbit?

01:20:52.375 --> 01:20:52.915
None.

01:20:53.083 --> 01:20:56.165
The red ones. How many are there?

01:20:57.208 --> 01:20:59.249
Zero, I think they flew away.

01:20:59.416 --> 01:21:02.290
They didn't fly away,
he destroyed my radar.

01:21:02.666 --> 01:21:04.957
Sabotage, of course he sabotaged me!

01:21:05.125 --> 01:21:07.124
I'm so stupid, fuck!

01:21:08.916 --> 01:21:11.249
- You're done talking.
- Please give me my phone.

01:21:11.625 --> 01:21:12.625
Miłosz?!

01:21:14.791 --> 01:21:15.957
What did you say to me?

01:21:16.125 --> 01:21:17.749
I said give me back my fucking phone!

01:21:17.916 --> 01:21:18.916
What did you say?

01:21:27.291 --> 01:21:28.665
Miłosz, what's going on?!

01:21:28.875 --> 01:21:30.832
Give me back my phone...

01:21:32.208 --> 01:21:33.208
Fuck...

01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:43.082
I won't call my brother.

01:21:43.291 --> 01:21:46.165
- Why not?
- I'm not calling my brother!

01:21:46.333 --> 01:21:49.832
- You want him to pass out in here?!
- I'm not calling him!

01:21:50.125 --> 01:21:50.874
Then I will!

01:21:51.041 --> 01:21:52.207
Yeah, sure.

01:21:52.583 --> 01:21:54.707
- I'm going to tell my parents.
- Wait.

01:21:54.875 --> 01:21:56.832
- Chill out.
- Call him!

01:21:57.041 --> 01:21:58.041
Fuck.

01:22:06.375 --> 01:22:08.957
- Hey, Tomek, listen up...
- Hang on.

01:22:09.541 --> 01:22:11.582
What do you do, if you get too high?

01:22:13.083 --> 01:22:17.915
Because I took, I mean borrowed
your weed stashed behind the radiator...

01:22:19.916 --> 01:22:21.707
Tomek! Hello?!

01:22:23.375 --> 01:22:26.165
- Fuck, he hung up.
- I'm going down to my folks.

01:22:27.416 --> 01:22:31.249
We are screwed for life.

01:23:06.208 --> 01:23:12.124
One way; flying to: any destination.

01:23:31.125 --> 01:23:33.457
Fuck you, dickhead!

01:24:15.625 --> 01:24:18.165
Hey, are you okay?

01:24:25.125 --> 01:24:26.499
Are you alright?

01:24:37.666 --> 01:24:38.666
Mom?

01:24:39.375 --> 01:24:41.707
Finally, Miłosz! What happened?

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:45.290
I'll go crazy here, what is going on?!

01:24:48.333 --> 01:24:50.207
Read the notifications.

01:24:51.208 --> 01:24:52.499
In the bottom.

01:24:52.666 --> 01:24:53.832
Which ones?

01:25:01.541 --> 01:25:03.290
You can read the last one.

01:25:03.708 --> 01:25:07.999
Justa, I told you it's him.
Someone beat him up.

01:25:08.208 --> 01:25:09.624
- Who?
- Miłosz, Kama's brother.

01:25:10.291 --> 01:25:11.291
He works here?

01:25:11.333 --> 01:25:12.415
Jesus, I don't know...

01:25:12.583 --> 01:25:15.332
Wiktoria said he was
running around with plates.

01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:19.165
Maybe Kama has this energy imbalance
because of him?

01:25:19.666 --> 01:25:21.915
- I mean they're siblings...
- Where are you going?

01:25:22.125 --> 01:25:24.499
Something's wrong with Wiktoria.

01:25:26.333 --> 01:25:27.333
Fuck.

01:25:31.791 --> 01:25:34.499
- You're taking care of him now.
- Ladybug...

01:25:39.625 --> 01:25:41.207
Have you seen Dawid?

01:25:41.375 --> 01:25:43.499
- What Dawid?
- The fucking groom!

01:25:45.166 --> 01:25:47.290
Wow, soon you'll be this...

01:25:47.708 --> 01:25:49.082
...dressed up in a suit.

01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:51.582
At your wedding. Another one.

01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:52.915
Not so soon.

01:25:54.541 --> 01:25:57.415
In a couple of months. That's soon.
You'll see how time flies.

01:25:59.708 --> 01:26:01.124
Remember our wedding?

01:26:02.041 --> 01:26:03.457
That was fucked up.

01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:07.624
But I guess all weddings are fucked up.

01:26:07.791 --> 01:26:08.915
I hope not.

01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:13.707
I mean... maybe fucked up people
have fucked up weddings.

01:26:18.666 --> 01:26:20.415
We can sit here for a while,
if you want.

01:26:20.583 --> 01:26:23.165
I have to go, I've got work to do.

01:26:25.375 --> 01:26:28.290
I don't know why I said that.
I have nothing to do.

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:30.082
You're not writing?

01:26:34.708 --> 01:26:36.249
I think too much.

01:26:38.083 --> 01:26:39.915
Too much or too little.

01:26:43.625 --> 01:26:47.374
We can go for a beer. if you like.

01:26:47.958 --> 01:26:49.457
I'm just saying.

01:26:51.833 --> 01:26:53.290
A goodbye drink.

01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:55.499
Or maybe goodbye sex?

01:26:55.791 --> 01:26:58.665
I'm just kidding, I'm sorry.

01:27:02.583 --> 01:27:05.332
- It's on me.
- No, no way.

01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:06.874
Let's split it.

01:27:18.583 --> 01:27:19.583
So?

01:27:20.916 --> 01:27:22.499
We have to say goodbye somehow.

01:27:32.458 --> 01:27:33.499
Wiktoria!

01:27:35.708 --> 01:27:36.874
It started.

01:28:39.083 --> 01:28:41.374
I understand, but what should we do?

01:28:41.541 --> 01:28:44.082
- Who are you talking to?
- 911. They said to wait.

01:28:44.250 --> 01:28:47.415
For what?! Give me that.
My friend wants to talk to you.

01:28:47.583 --> 01:28:49.374
- Because... apparently...
- it's too soon!

01:28:49.541 --> 01:28:51.165
I know, but she's having these pains.

01:28:51.333 --> 01:28:54.017
The doctor said that's how it works.
You can already see the placenta.

01:28:54.041 --> 01:28:55.457
What placenta...

01:28:56.416 --> 01:28:57.499
How long?!

01:28:58.208 --> 01:29:00.040
This must be some kind of joke.

01:29:36.833 --> 01:29:38.582
Son of a bitch!

01:29:47.583 --> 01:29:51.582
- Fuck, I give up!
- Get in the car and go to the hospital!

01:29:51.958 --> 01:29:53.582
What do you want?!

01:29:57.083 --> 01:29:58.415
Don't touch me!

01:29:58.666 --> 01:30:00.540
Everybody calm down!

01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:04.040
I'm a certified doctor,
everything is under control.

01:30:04.208 --> 01:30:07.415
Let's just calm the situation down.

01:30:08.458 --> 01:30:10.499
I've seen worse at weddings.

01:30:11.791 --> 01:30:13.582
The ambulance is 15 kilometers away.

01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:14.750
What the fuck!

01:30:15.958 --> 01:30:19.165
Jesus Christ... don't touch me!

01:30:19.833 --> 01:30:21.207
No worries, we'll manage!

01:30:21.375 --> 01:30:24.499
- We need to clear the space out a bit.
- Give me my phone.

01:30:24.666 --> 01:30:26.707
- It wasn't there...
- What do you mean?

01:30:26.916 --> 01:30:28.499
- On the table!
- It wasn't there...

01:30:28.708 --> 01:30:29.708
Give me my phone!

01:30:35.958 --> 01:30:38.624
Jesus, I give up!

01:30:38.791 --> 01:30:41.957
- I can't do this!
- Stop yelling.

01:30:43.375 --> 01:30:44.790
'Shit' and 'fuck', non stop.

01:30:46.958 --> 01:30:48.040
Chopin...

01:31:29.541 --> 01:31:30.707
I'm scared.

01:31:36.083 --> 01:31:38.249
I'm so scared.

01:31:43.916 --> 01:31:45.665
Fuck!

01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:15.624
Take this shit away from me!

01:32:17.666 --> 01:32:19.915
Ela, darling, any white left?

01:32:20.291 --> 01:32:21.291
- White.
- Great.

01:32:21.458 --> 01:32:23.665
- Is this one alright?
- Yep.

01:32:24.166 --> 01:32:25.499
Nice mask, huh?

01:32:26.208 --> 01:32:27.665
Well, you know...

01:32:28.125 --> 01:32:30.040
There's nothing to be afraid of.

01:32:30.208 --> 01:32:32.874
I'd be more scared
of a plane crash than...

01:32:33.083 --> 01:32:34.249
- Stop it.
- I'm serious!

01:32:34.416 --> 01:32:36.915
Than of a diving accident.

01:32:37.083 --> 01:32:39.999
Look at him, he's a natural diver.

01:32:40.708 --> 01:32:43.415
Although if he has as much luck
in diving as in guessing,

01:32:43.583 --> 01:32:45.290
anything can happen.

01:32:47.333 --> 01:32:50.874
Go ahead, Andrzej!
Or I won't take you to Egypt!

01:32:51.041 --> 01:32:52.374
What is it, darling?

01:33:08.375 --> 01:33:12.415
Do I exist or not?

01:33:12.708 --> 01:33:13.708
Hello.

01:33:15.958 --> 01:33:18.707
I'm sorry, you're luggage is too big.

01:33:20.083 --> 01:33:21.207
What do you mean too big?

01:33:21.625 --> 01:33:23.499
It has to fit in here.

01:33:37.333 --> 01:33:39.874
Ladies and gentlemen, everybody out!

01:33:40.041 --> 01:33:43.082
- I'll be right outside.
- I can't do it.

01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:44.457
You go, girl!

01:33:45.541 --> 01:33:48.249
Let's go, we have
a baby to deliver here!

01:33:57.250 --> 01:34:01.582
- Famous, famous...
- Give me a chance.

01:34:05.583 --> 01:34:07.665
Maybe it's...

01:34:10.458 --> 01:34:13.040
Calm down, it's only a game.

01:34:14.291 --> 01:34:16.040
- Honey...
- Okay, when was it?

01:34:16.208 --> 01:34:17.624
"Sorry."

01:34:22.166 --> 01:34:24.165
Planet "K" crystal mines:

01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:26.499
142 units destroyed.

01:34:28.291 --> 01:34:31.832
Planet "K" power plant:
67 units destroyed.

01:34:32.708 --> 01:34:37.415
Planet "K" factories:
467 units destroyed.

01:34:38.625 --> 01:34:43.290
The aggressor took over 100%
of all planet resources.

01:34:56.416 --> 01:34:57.874
Planet structure broken.

01:34:58.083 --> 01:35:03.207
Nabulus-5 destroyed
in 87... 88 percent.

01:35:04.666 --> 01:35:06.207
It keeps growing.

01:35:07.333 --> 01:35:09.290
It's coming.
No worries, everything will be fine.

01:35:09.458 --> 01:35:12.499
We will push on the count of three,

01:35:13.333 --> 01:35:15.290
and then we can scream all we want.

01:35:16.625 --> 01:35:17.625
One...

01:35:27.250 --> 01:35:28.540
98...

01:35:28.833 --> 01:35:30.540
Two...

01:35:35.125 --> 01:35:36.665
99...

01:35:36.958 --> 01:35:37.958
And...

01:35:39.291 --> 01:35:42.374
Wait, I know, I know!

01:35:43.625 --> 01:35:45.082
I think I know.

01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:47.500
Three!

01:35:50.416 --> 01:35:52.040
Amadeusz, honey, what's wrong?

01:36:06.583 --> 01:36:08.040
There's nothing left.

01:36:09.305 --> 01:36:15.844
