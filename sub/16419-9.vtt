00:22.241 --> 00:23.723
- Hey, I told you!

00:23.724 --> 00:25.516
Don't call me "little buddy,"

00:25.517 --> 00:28.171
I have not approved
that nickname.

00:28.172 --> 00:29.792
- What are you doin'
in that sink?

00:29.793 --> 00:31.033
- Washin' my shirt.

00:31.034 --> 00:33.309
- And why in our sink?

00:33.310 --> 00:35.826
- Uh, 'cuz washing
a shirt in a toilet

00:35.827 --> 00:37.655
would be disgusting.

00:39.931 --> 00:41.585
- I can't talk to you.

00:41.586 --> 00:43.102
Babe, Kenzie...

00:43.103 --> 00:45.550
- Yeah.
- Sup', little buddy?

00:45.551 --> 00:47.240
- No! Okay, no.

00:47.241 --> 00:49.688
You guys are not gonna
start callin' me "little buddy."

00:49.689 --> 00:52.206
- The more you fight it
the stronger it gets.

00:53.965 --> 00:55.171
- I'm serious people,
we've been through this.

00:55.172 --> 00:56.172
The only nicknames...

00:56.173 --> 00:57.412
- Whoa, you guys...

00:57.413 --> 00:59.067
this is so cool.

00:59.068 --> 01:00.343
Guess who tagged Game Shakers?

01:00.344 --> 01:01.826
- Uhhh...
- Give us a hint.

01:01.827 --> 01:03.067
- Okay, she's a famous singer.

01:03.068 --> 01:04.827
- Cher! Is it Cher?!?

01:07.344 --> 01:09.964
- No, it's not Cher.

01:09.965 --> 01:11.550
- Just tell us who tagged us.

01:11.551 --> 01:12.655
- Kayla Bunger.

01:16.275 --> 01:17.412
- Kayla Bunger really tagged us?
For real??!?

01:17.413 --> 01:19.309
Don't tease me with lies.

01:19.310 --> 01:21.826
- Kenzie. Look at her post...

01:25.310 --> 01:26.688
- "Hey Game Shakers,

01:26.689 --> 01:28.447

with your games.

01:28.448 --> 01:29.999

Oh my God, she loves us!

01:35.413 --> 01:37.171
She gave us a winky-face!

01:37.172 --> 01:40.136
- Okay, it's not
that big a deal.

01:40.137 --> 01:41.757
- It is too! Ooo quick!

01:41.758 --> 01:43.481
Post a response saying
that we love her too,

01:43.482 --> 01:45.964
and that we'll absolutely
make a game about her!

01:45.965 --> 01:48.205
- All right I will.

01:48.206 --> 01:50.205
Hands off the merchandise.

01:50.206 --> 01:53.309
- Dude, why you freakin' out?

01:53.310 --> 01:55.412
- Yeah, Kayla Bunger
is just a singer.

01:55.413 --> 01:56.654
- Pa-lease.

01:56.655 --> 01:58.240
She's the biggest singer
in the world!

01:58.241 --> 01:59.378
She's got over
42 million followers,

01:59.379 --> 02:02.964
her world concert tour
sold out in 20 minutes,

02:02.965 --> 02:05.309
and I wanna be her friend so bad
I could spit a brick!

02:05.310 --> 02:08.309
- Eh... dude, even if she...

02:08.310 --> 02:09.757
- Oh man!
- Ahhh!

02:09.758 --> 02:11.585

02:11.586 --> 02:13.999
- I'm not eatin'
that butt-ugly burger!

02:15.482 --> 02:17.274
Not that I really care,

02:17.275 --> 02:20.102
but what's goin' on here, Dub?

02:20.103 --> 02:22.102
- I'll tell you what's goin' on.

02:22.103 --> 02:23.274
Kenzie, pull up
the Clam Jumper website.

02:23.275 --> 02:24.757
Go on. Go on. Go on.

02:24.758 --> 02:25.758
- Yes sir.
- Thank you.

02:25.759 --> 02:28.274
- Why are you so upset?

02:28.275 --> 02:30.240
- 'Cuz! We were hungry,

02:30.241 --> 02:31.861
and we went down
to Clam Jumper...

02:31.862 --> 02:33.171
- Dub ordered a clam burger.

02:33.172 --> 02:34.448

02:36.034 --> 02:38.102
I ordered a clam burger.

02:38.103 --> 02:39.895

Jumper website up.

02:44.551 --> 02:45.757
Girl, get... just click

02:45.758 --> 02:46.827
- All right.

02:49.172 --> 02:50.447
- Alright, you see that?

02:50.448 --> 02:51.999
Look at that burger.
Look at it.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.550
Don't you just wanna
get all over that?

02:54.551 --> 02:56.309
- Mm-hm.

02:56.310 --> 03:00.136

come here to work.

03:00.137 --> 03:01.757

03:09.827 --> 03:11.067

want to eat this!

03:11.068 --> 03:12.586
D'ah!

- Hmmm, depends.

05:22.344 --> 05:25.102
Does Kayla like hideous dresses?

05:25.103 --> 05:26.274
- Whaaaat...

05:26.275 --> 05:27.516
it's a bridesmaid's dress,

05:27.517 --> 05:29.102
from my cousin's wedding.

05:29.103 --> 05:30.171
I only wore it for an hour

05:30.172 --> 05:31.103
'cuz the groom never showed up.

05:31.104 --> 05:34.067
- Or maybe he did show up,

05:34.068 --> 05:35.274
saw that dress,

05:35.275 --> 05:37.000
then drove his car into a river.

05:38.413 --> 05:39.931
- I have other options.

05:41.448 --> 05:42.826
- Hey Game Shakers!

05:42.827 --> 05:44.343
- Can't talk right now,
I'm exiting.

05:46.931 --> 05:47.964
- What is...?

05:47.965 --> 05:50.240
Umm... uh... NO!

05:50.241 --> 05:51.274
- No what?

05:51.275 --> 05:53.861
- Just 'cuz Kayla Bunger
is comin' here

05:53.862 --> 05:54.586
doesn't mean we gotta listen

05:54.587 --> 05:56.826
to her poppy, girly music.

05:56.827 --> 05:58.481
- But it's really good.

05:58.482 --> 06:00.448
Here...

06:03.275 --> 06:04.930
- What's he...

06:04.931 --> 06:06.688
Hey man, don't be doin' that
with your body.

06:06.689 --> 06:09.482
- C'mon! Feel the groove...

06:11.172 --> 06:12.619
Yeah, you like it.

06:12.620 --> 06:15.586
C'mon, let those hips go...

06:17.172 --> 06:19.067

06:24.448 --> 06:25.792

06:25.793 --> 06:27.344

06:38.206 --> 06:40.758
Kayla Bunger you're there.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.000
Sorry, I didn't see you before.

06:48.137 --> 06:49.999
Hey, I'm Babe.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.240

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Ahh...

06:56.482 --> 06:58.240
- Hey Kayla. My name's Trip.

06:58.241 --> 06:59.309
- You can call him
"little buddy."

06:59.310 --> 07:01.413
- No... she can't.

07:02.965 --> 07:05.447
- Uh who's...

07:05.448 --> 07:07.102
- Oh, that's my European
boyfriend, Febreetzio...

07:07.103 --> 07:08.758
- I am boyfriend.

07:10.103 --> 07:12.171
And that's my bodyguard,
Big Sir.

07:12.172 --> 07:13.758
- I'm Big.

07:16.206 --> 07:19.205
- So, you created Gameshakers?

07:19.206 --> 07:20.757
- Yeah!

07:20.758 --> 07:22.102
Well, me and my friend Kenzie,
who's um...

07:22.103 --> 07:24.481
Kenzie!!

07:24.482 --> 07:26.205
- So, you guys really wanna
make a game about me?

07:26.206 --> 07:28.723
- Pfft, yeah, totally.

07:28.724 --> 07:30.309
- Oh, we were thinkin'
about a lifestyle game.

07:30.310 --> 07:32.516
- Yeah, y'know like,
a player gets to be you,

07:32.517 --> 07:34.654
and spend a day
in your super-cool life,

07:34.655 --> 07:36.033
and y'know, we were thinking,

07:36.034 --> 07:38.205
maybe we give your character
a flamethrower

07:38.206 --> 07:39.481
to use on the paparazzi.

07:39.482 --> 07:41.309
- Ooo, I love that.

07:41.310 --> 07:43.654
- Ha, she loves that.

07:43.655 --> 07:45.136
- Uhh...

07:45.137 --> 07:46.447
If it's gonna be
a lifestyle game,

07:46.448 --> 07:47.792
we should probably hang out,

07:47.793 --> 07:49.412
so like, you can
get to know about my life.

07:49.413 --> 07:50.655
Y'know, if you want.

07:52.586 --> 07:55.103
- Uh yes, research
is often beneficial.

07:56.896 --> 07:58.343
- So, tonight I'm havin'
a thing at my place

07:58.344 --> 07:59.344
if you wanna come.

07:59.344 --> 08:00.344
- Your place?

08:00.345 --> 08:01.447
- Can we come?!?

08:01.448 --> 08:02.413
- We would like to come!

08:02.414 --> 08:04.516
- Uh, sorry guys,

08:04.517 --> 08:06.205
it's kind of a girls thing.

08:06.206 --> 08:07.481
- Well we've done that!

08:07.482 --> 08:09.412
- And we'd do it again!

08:09.413 --> 08:11.862
- Yeeeaahhh-noooo.

08:13.379 --> 08:14.895
- Sorry it took me so long.

08:14.896 --> 08:16.999
I had a bear of a time
squeezing my...

08:17.000 --> 08:19.930
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!

08:19.931 --> 08:21.691
- I'd say "be cool"
but I feel it's too late.

08:23.586 --> 08:24.792
- Hi Kayla!
My name is Kenzie Bell!

08:24.793 --> 08:26.205
Which means my initials are K-B,

08:26.206 --> 08:27.654
and your initials are K-B,

08:27.655 --> 08:29.240
so I guess that makes us
a couple a'K-Bees,

08:29.241 --> 08:31.792
hangin' out together.
A-ha ha ha!

08:31.793 --> 08:34.240
- Stop it.

08:34.241 --> 08:36.654
Uh, Kenzie is the one who
created Game Shakers with me.

08:36.655 --> 08:38.930
- Ah cool, I love your games.

08:38.931 --> 08:40.412
- Aw, I love you.

08:40.413 --> 08:41.688
- That's sweet.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.136
- No, like seriously,

08:43.137 --> 08:44.137
I'd kill for you.

08:45.793 --> 08:47.481
- Guess what.
Kayla invited you and Babe

08:47.482 --> 08:48.861
to a party at her place tonight.

08:48.862 --> 08:49.862
- What?!?

08:49.863 --> 08:51.619
- Yeah, so we can do research

08:51.620 --> 08:53.447
for the game we're making a...

08:53.448 --> 08:54.964
- Whoah! Wait a second...

08:54.965 --> 08:56.102
Are those leather pants?

08:56.103 --> 08:57.378
- Oh, yeah, ya like 'em?

08:57.379 --> 08:59.171
- No. I don't.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.723
- Wh-why not?

09:00.724 --> 09:02.826
I don't like it when
people wear leather.

09:02.827 --> 09:04.378
- But-but they're fake leather!

09:04.379 --> 09:05.550
They're fleather!

09:05.551 --> 09:07.447
- You can't hang at my place

09:07.448 --> 09:09.274
wearing pants
that look like leather.

09:09.275 --> 09:10.481
- Well then she'll change.

09:10.482 --> 09:12.067
- Yeah!
- Noo...

09:12.068 --> 09:15.895
Look, just give me a day
to get over this, okay?

09:15.896 --> 09:17.412
- All right.

09:17.413 --> 09:19.240
- Wow.

09:19.241 --> 09:20.758
Shut down hard.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.240
- Baby, time for going, eh?

09:24.241 --> 09:25.723
- Cool.

09:25.724 --> 09:27.240
C'mon Babe, we out.

09:27.241 --> 09:28.517
- 'Kay!

09:32.965 --> 09:34.585
Don't feel bad.

09:34.586 --> 09:36.240
Next time, we'll both
hang out with her... 'kay?

09:36.241 --> 09:37.964
- 'Kay.

09:37.965 --> 09:39.102
- Bye boys!

09:39.103 --> 09:40.793
- Later gator.
- Adios.

09:43.172 --> 09:45.447
- Hey, if you're gonna throw
those fleather pants away,

09:45.448 --> 09:47.103
I'll take 'em.

09:49.034 --> 09:50.586
- Give him the pants.

09:59.896 --> 10:01.033
- Hey Kenz!

10:01.034 --> 10:02.412
- Oh hi.

10:02.413 --> 10:03.585
- I texted you after the party

10:03.586 --> 10:04.757
at Kayla's last night.

10:04.758 --> 10:05.930
Why didn't you text me back?

10:05.931 --> 10:08.240
- Y'know what I did last night?

10:08.241 --> 10:09.999
I baked some homemade food bars,

10:10.000 --> 10:11.136
gave my dog a bath,

10:11.137 --> 10:12.481
and fell asleep at 9:30.

10:12.482 --> 10:15.412
- Well, dogs are fun.

10:15.413 --> 10:17.551
- Mine only has three legs.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.931
His name is Wobbles.

10:22.344 --> 10:23.688
- Who's the text from?

10:23.689 --> 10:25.102
Your new best friend,
Kayla Bunger?

10:25.103 --> 10:26.447
- Yeah.

10:26.448 --> 10:27.826
- Wh... No way, really?!?

10:27.827 --> 10:29.343
- Shh-shh! Be cool.
She's here.

10:29.344 --> 10:30.792
- What?!?

10:30.793 --> 10:32.033
Hi Kayla, it's me again!

10:32.034 --> 10:34.343
- Shhh!

10:34.344 --> 10:35.723
- What? What'd I...

10:35.724 --> 10:37.343
- She doesn't wanna
be recognized.

10:37.344 --> 10:39.551
- Ohhh right.

10:40.517 --> 10:42.619
- Hey Kayla, look at me,

10:42.620 --> 10:43.930
I'm not wearing pants!

10:43.931 --> 10:45.481
Remember? You hated my pants,

10:45.482 --> 10:47.895
so I gave 'em away.

10:47.896 --> 10:49.067
- Uh-huh.

10:49.068 --> 10:49.448
Hey, give 'em the stuff.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.586
- Ah.

10:53.137 --> 10:54.723
- What are...?

10:54.724 --> 10:57.654
- These are tickets to
The Platinum Music Awards!

10:57.655 --> 10:59.861
With backstage passes!

10:59.862 --> 11:00.551
- Yeah, I'm up for some awards,

11:00.552 --> 11:02.792
and I'm performing.

11:02.793 --> 11:04.550
- And you're inviting us?!
- Uh-huh.

11:04.551 --> 11:06.000
- Ahhhh!!!!

11:08.172 --> 11:10.619
- Do not scream. Okay?

11:10.620 --> 11:12.310
- Okay, I promise I won't.

11:13.827 --> 11:16.274
- Boo Boo, you hungry?

11:16.275 --> 11:17.068
- So hungry.

11:17.069 --> 11:19.654
- Ooo! I have a snack for you!

11:19.655 --> 11:20.655
- What is it?

11:20.656 --> 11:22.067
- A food bar,

11:22.068 --> 11:24.481
that I made myself
in my own toaster oven!

11:24.482 --> 11:26.586
Try a bite.

11:28.551 --> 11:30.412
- Mmmm...

11:30.413 --> 11:32.861
It's really good.

11:32.862 --> 11:34.688
- What's in that food bar?

11:34.689 --> 11:38.240
- Well, mostly it's made
of honey, pectin,

11:38.241 --> 11:40.550
dried fruits, caribou...

11:40.551 --> 11:42.550
- Caribou?

11:42.551 --> 11:43.792
What is?

11:43.793 --> 11:46.757
- Oh, carob, it's like
a natural chocolate.

11:46.758 --> 11:48.309
- No, I didn't say carob,

11:48.310 --> 11:49.930
I said caribou.

11:49.931 --> 11:52.412
It's like, uh... reindeer meat.

11:52.413 --> 11:53.655
- Like a'Rudolph?

11:55.103 --> 11:56.205
- What?!

11:56.206 --> 11:57.688
You just made me eat meat?

11:57.689 --> 11:59.412
I'm a vegan!

11:59.413 --> 12:00.585
- A vegan?

12:00.586 --> 12:03.171
- Yeah! Level five!

12:03.172 --> 12:06.481
Oh my God... oh my God!

12:06.482 --> 12:07.930
- Eh, it's okay, just...

12:07.931 --> 12:09.240
Here, make the vomit.
I catch it for you!

12:09.241 --> 12:10.655
- No! I'm leaving!

12:13.827 --> 12:15.758
Lemme see your ticket for a sec.

12:19.724 --> 12:21.344
- Baby, it's okay!
- No! Nothing's okay!

12:22.965 --> 12:26.757
- Oh, I could not feel worse.

12:26.758 --> 12:27.895
- Hey Kenzie...

12:27.896 --> 12:29.895
I'm lovin' the pants.

12:29.896 --> 12:31.343
Pow!

12:43.758 --> 12:46.137
- Hey Kenzie.
- Check us out.

12:48.655 --> 12:50.965
- You guys look like
crayons with hats.

12:52.448 --> 12:55.619
- Kenzie, I forgive you
for insulting our tuxedos.

12:55.620 --> 12:57.378
- Yeah, don't care.

12:57.379 --> 12:59.964
- And I know you only
said that 'cuz you're upset

12:59.965 --> 13:02.757
that my dad got us tickets
to The Platinum Awards,

13:02.758 --> 13:05.240
and Kayla Bunger ripped
your ticket all up.

13:05.241 --> 13:06.862
Rip, rip, rip.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.516
- Well I'm going too, so...

13:10.517 --> 13:12.654
- Ooo. that's moist, oh...

13:12.655 --> 13:15.343
- Where'd you get
another ticket from?

13:15.344 --> 13:16.378
- Double G.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.516
The girl he was gonna bring

13:17.517 --> 13:18.826
fell off his yacht last night,

13:18.827 --> 13:20.067
and since she hasn't
been found yet,

13:20.068 --> 13:21.792
he said I could have her ticket.

13:21.793 --> 13:23.861
- Heyyyy nice!

13:23.862 --> 13:26.378

13:34.655 --> 13:36.136
- Nooooo...

13:36.137 --> 13:37.826
I ordered us some food
to eat before we go.

13:37.827 --> 13:39.378
- Cool, where'd you order from?

13:39.379 --> 13:40.585
- The Clam Jumper.

13:40.586 --> 13:41.654
- What?!?

13:41.655 --> 13:44.171
Wh... three days ago
you were all mad

13:44.172 --> 13:45.930
about that mucked up
clam burger they gave you.

13:45.931 --> 13:48.205
- Ah, one bad burger.
Who cares?

13:48.206 --> 13:50.343
- You did!

13:50.344 --> 13:52.171
- Uhh... Can you guys
keep it down please

13:52.172 --> 13:55.034
so I can focus on my game demo
for Kayla Bunger?

13:56.827 --> 13:58.550
- Why don't you just
finish it tomorrow?

13:58.551 --> 14:00.033
- Nooo, I'm on deadline.

14:00.034 --> 14:01.481
I have to use my coding skills

14:01.482 --> 14:03.205
to make Kayla love me again.

14:03.206 --> 14:05.896
- Uh... did she ever love you?

14:07.758 --> 14:09.102
- Why hurt me?

14:09.103 --> 14:10.413
I've been good to you.

14:12.413 --> 14:14.964
- 'Scuse me.
I got food from The Clam Jumper.

14:14.965 --> 14:18.550
- Well it's about clam time!

14:18.551 --> 14:20.343
You, give me the food...

14:20.344 --> 14:22.826

from one a'those two big idiots.

14:22.827 --> 14:25.895
- Hey, wait a minute.
You're Double G.

14:25.896 --> 14:28.309
- Uh yeah, but I don't
have time for a selfie,

14:28.310 --> 14:31.137
and no, I don't wanna
hear your demo.

14:32.793 --> 14:34.723
- I just need the food
back for a moment.

14:34.724 --> 14:36.964
- But... but why?

14:36.965 --> 14:39.792

14:41.517 --> 14:44.550
- Sorry sir, but you're banned
from The Clam Jumper.

14:45.793 --> 14:47.930
- For life.

14:47.931 --> 14:49.654
- He's banned?

14:49.655 --> 14:50.895
- For what?!?

14:50.896 --> 14:51.758
- Three days ago,
you went online

14:51.759 --> 14:54.274
and told your 50 million
followers

14:54.275 --> 14:56.240
to never eat at our restaurant.

14:56.241 --> 14:57.619
- Aww...

14:57.620 --> 14:58.792
Yeah, see what had
happened was...

14:58.793 --> 15:00.102
I was feelin' a lil' emotional...

15:00.103 --> 15:01.068
- Sorry.

15:01.069 --> 15:02.723
Yesterday, all us employees

15:02.724 --> 15:04.206

15:09.137 --> 15:10.481
- But I didn't mean it!

15:10.482 --> 15:13.723
I love The Clam Jumper!

15:13.724 --> 15:15.826
- And done!

15:15.827 --> 15:17.619

the Kayla Bunger game

15:17.620 --> 15:18.930
is ready for her to see,

15:18.931 --> 15:21.136

15:21.137 --> 15:22.861

15:22.862 --> 15:24.205

We can go after I eat
that Clam Jumper food

15:28.896 --> 15:29.964

15:29.965 --> 15:31.343
- Why?
- Dad!

15:31.344 --> 15:32.654
- Man Dub!
- I eat what I want, man!

15:32.655 --> 15:34.000
- Fire in the hole!

15:41.344 --> 15:44.551
- Nothing personal.
I love your music.

15:52.655 --> 15:56.481
- And recording next on
The Platinum Music Awards,

15:56.482 --> 16:01.102

16:01.103 --> 16:02.654
- Ooo, there's Kayla!

16:02.655 --> 16:03.688
Oh my God, look at her dress!

16:03.689 --> 16:05.447
Isn't it gorgeous?

16:05.448 --> 16:08.171
- It's all right.
- Looks blue.

16:08.172 --> 16:10.172
- Hey Dub!
There goes Kanye.

16:12.310 --> 16:14.136
- Ha! Ah yeah, that is Kanye.

16:14.137 --> 16:16.102
- Hey, let's go tickle him.

16:16.103 --> 16:17.136
- Yeah, let's tickle Kanye!

16:17.137 --> 16:18.309
- Haha! All right...

16:18.310 --> 16:20.585
but when he says stop,
we gotta respect that.

16:20.586 --> 16:22.412
- Okay!

16:22.413 --> 16:23.586
- Yeezy!
- Yay!

16:29.310 --> 16:31.171

16:32.586 --> 16:33.999
- Cool. You girls talk.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.447
We're gonna go
get some shrimp puffs.

16:35.448 --> 16:36.861
- You think they'll
have dipping sauce?

16:36.862 --> 16:38.309
- Dude, this isn't
the Tony Awards.

16:38.310 --> 16:39.590
Yeah they'll have dipping sauce.

16:41.172 --> 16:42.585
- Wait, so you finish

16:42.586 --> 16:43.103
- Yeah! Let's go show her!

16:43.104 --> 16:45.136
- W-w-w-wait.

16:45.137 --> 16:47.067
The game has no leather
and no meat, right?

16:47.068 --> 16:50.068
- Promise.
- We go. Kayla!

16:51.482 --> 16:53.757
- Oh, there you are.

16:53.758 --> 16:55.516
- Kayla, you go

16:55.517 --> 16:56.586
- Cool.

17:03.758 --> 17:05.205
- So, Kayla, um...

17:56.172 --> 17:58.654
- Okaaaay, it was all me.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.447
First you move in across
