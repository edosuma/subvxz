                      Okay.     

06:28.753 --> 06:30.488
  Put your leg                  
over here.                      

06:30.490 --> 06:32.490
        Oh, I get it.           

06:32.492 --> 06:35.626
    Take your left arm, put it  
 around my neck here, like that.

06:35.628 --> 06:37.328
  Yeah. That's it.              
     All right.                 

06:37.330 --> 06:38.463
You ready?                      
              Yeah.             

06:38.465 --> 06:40.965
     Go.                        
              Mmm!              

06:40.967 --> 06:43.734
Wait a second. There's something
missing. Something's not right. 

06:43.736 --> 06:44.902
Ah! I got it.                   

06:44.904 --> 06:46.570
They're naked. We gotta         
take our clothes off.           

06:46.572 --> 06:47.938
             Michael!           

06:47.940 --> 06:49.440
Give me a kiss.                 

06:49.442 --> 06:50.708
              Mmm!              

06:57.749 --> 06:59.817
    After three years           
          of marriage,          

06:59.819 --> 07:04.022
      he's still after her      
    like a hamburger.           

07:04.024 --> 07:05.723
              Hi, Daddy.        

07:05.725 --> 07:07.358
      Wait. Wait.               

07:07.360 --> 07:09.994
    Never mind                  
    the "Hi, Daddy."            

07:09.996 --> 07:12.830
What is this                    
piece of filth here             

07:12.832 --> 07:14.332
doing on my coffee table?       

07:14.334 --> 07:15.699
                     Filth?     

07:15.701 --> 07:17.735
            Arch, that's        
        a great reproduction.   

07:17.737 --> 07:21.439
  I don't want no reproducting  
      on my coffee table.       

07:23.675 --> 07:27.145
What is wrong with              
      this statue?              

07:27.147 --> 07:29.147
          It's naked            
        and I hate it.          

07:29.149 --> 07:31.015
I have never seen anybody       

07:31.017 --> 07:33.751
      get so uptight            
about the naked body.           

07:33.753 --> 07:35.019
Listen, little girl,            

07:35.021 --> 07:37.088
there's a time and a place      
for naked, you know?            

07:37.090 --> 07:38.389
But this thing here,            

07:38.391 --> 07:41.125
that can only be                
a fountain in a men's room.     

07:41.127 --> 07:43.694
        Oh, Daddy,              
      how can you say that      

07:43.696 --> 07:47.031
         about a statue         
that expresses pure love?       

07:47.033 --> 07:50.834
What's pure about two           
little naked people on a rock?  

07:50.836 --> 07:52.970
                 You're always  
              quoting the Bible.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.672
        What about Adam and Eve?
            They were naked.    

07:54.674 --> 07:56.074
            They probably sat on
            lots of rocks.      

07:56.076 --> 08:00.678
Don't talk like                 
an ignorosis, will you?         

08:00.680 --> 08:02.113
Let me tell you                 
something.                      

08:02.115 --> 08:04.715
Back in the days                
when God started making people, 

08:04.717 --> 08:07.818
he didn't know how naked        
was gonna look on them.         

08:10.089 --> 08:12.690
And when he found out, he didn't
like what he seen there,        

08:12.692 --> 08:14.758
and he told people              
to put clothes on them          

08:14.760 --> 08:16.860
and never to take them off      
again in public.                

08:16.862 --> 08:17.861
        Idiot!                  

08:17.863 --> 08:19.863
         You know something,    
                Arch?           

08:19.865 --> 08:23.601
    I wish that you had a zipper
      in the back of your head  

08:23.603 --> 08:26.537
        that I could open up,   
        put my hands in there   

08:26.539 --> 08:29.173
          and massage some sense
             into your brains.  

08:29.175 --> 08:30.541
  Get away                      
  from me.                      

08:30.543 --> 08:32.110
            Who are you to judge
                what's dirty?   

08:32.111 --> 08:33.977
          Even the Supreme Court
            copped out on that. 

08:33.980 --> 08:35.379
    They left the interpretation
          of what's obscene     

08:35.381 --> 08:36.813
            to local standards. 

08:36.816 --> 08:38.216
And they were right.            

08:38.217 --> 08:42.285
And this is my house            
and I'm the local standard.     

08:42.288 --> 08:44.288
 I want that thing              
the hell outta here.            

08:44.290 --> 08:46.290
Where'd you get it anyway?      
In some porno shop?             

08:46.292 --> 08:48.559
             No, it is not from 
            a porno shop.       

08:48.561 --> 08:51.162
              It is a gift to me
              from Irene Lorenzo

08:51.164 --> 08:53.331
                and I am not    
                 giving it back.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.699
Oh, Irene Lorenzo,              

08:55.701 --> 08:59.837
        the queen of the women's
          lubrication movement. 

09:03.775 --> 09:05.909
     What's she trying to do,   
         wharf your mind,       

09:05.911 --> 09:07.545
        bringing in garbage     
             like that?         

09:07.547 --> 09:09.747
    I am not standing around    

09:09.749 --> 09:13.083
     to hear a tasteless person,
    even if he is my father,    

09:13.085 --> 09:14.818
             insult a great work
                of art!         

09:14.820 --> 09:16.787
     I told you                 
I want it outta here.           

09:16.789 --> 09:19.023
          Dinner in             
         two minutes!           

09:19.025 --> 09:20.090
                     I'm gonna  
                     wash up.   

09:20.092 --> 09:21.692
              I'll help you, Ma.
          Outta here!           

09:21.694 --> 09:23.861
     I want that statue         
 to stay right where it is.     

09:23.863 --> 09:25.263
                    Out.        
  Do you hear me?               

09:25.265 --> 09:27.498
    I repeat, I want it         
 to stay right where it is.     

09:27.500 --> 09:28.899
This is my house too, you know, 

09:28.901 --> 09:31.001
and that means that I have      
    some rights around here.    

09:31.003 --> 09:33.937
  You do know that, don't you?  
      I have rights. I do!      

09:33.939 --> 09:38.042
For talking to your father like 
 that, you may leave this room. 

09:38.044 --> 09:40.978
                [DOORBELL RINGS]

09:42.181 --> 09:44.549
              That wife of yours
              has a mouth on her

09:44.551 --> 09:45.949
            bigger than         
          her whole body.       

09:45.951 --> 09:48.653
         I wonder where         
    she inherited it.           

09:50.189 --> 09:52.890
  Do me a favor, will you,      
        and shut up.            

09:52.892 --> 09:55.693
                 I haven't said 
                  a word yet.   

09:55.695 --> 09:57.094
Well, look                      
who's here.                     

09:57.096 --> 10:00.431
Frank Lorenzo,                  
the prince of pepperoni.        

10:00.433 --> 10:02.032
            I'm sorry, Arch.    
              I can't stay long.

10:02.034 --> 10:04.034
 I just brought this recipe     
         for Edith.             

10:04.036 --> 10:05.603
                Yeah, well,     
        she's in the kitchen.   

10:05.605 --> 10:09.106
  Oh-ho! Whoa, whoa, whoa!      
What have we got here?          

10:09.108 --> 10:10.474
     <i>The Kiss.</i>                  

10:10.476 --> 10:13.143
We've got a reproduction        
just like that at our house.    

10:13.145 --> 10:15.313
        No, you got one         
    just like that in our house.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.847
        What?                   

10:16.849 --> 10:20.218
Your wife Irene gave that statue
     to my daughter Gloria.     

10:20.220 --> 10:22.520
My wife Irene gave that statue--
            Gave that statue--  

10:22.522 --> 10:24.222
To your daughter Gloria?        
          To my daughter Gloria.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.256
Without asking me?              

10:25.258 --> 10:27.625
                 She just--     

10:27.627 --> 10:29.627
  You mean Irene didn't ask you?
        No.                     

10:29.629 --> 10:31.662
That's my favorite              
        statue.                 

10:31.664 --> 10:35.132
That's my <i>Kiss.</i> My <i>Kiss.</i>        
     I want my <i>Kiss.</i>            

10:35.134 --> 10:37.868
            Oh. Oh, Frank,      
     you're gonna get your <i>Kiss.</i>

10:37.870 --> 10:40.638
    I think Irene only loaned   
         that statue to Gloria. 

10:40.640 --> 10:42.673
        In fact, I think I heard
          mention made of that. 

10:42.675 --> 10:44.174
             Here. Why don't you
                take it?        

10:44.176 --> 10:47.245
If it's a loan, keep it a while 
longer if you really like it.   

10:47.247 --> 10:49.947
         I really like it better
              at your house.    

10:49.949 --> 10:50.948
    Okay.                       

10:50.950 --> 10:52.483
 Give this recipe               
    to Edith.                   

10:52.485 --> 10:54.151
Yeah, sure.                     
I'll give it to her.            

10:54.153 --> 10:55.319
    Yeah.                       

10:55.321 --> 10:58.256
             You know, Arch,    
         you really surprise me.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.458
      I didn't think you'd go in
        for this kind of stuff. 

11:00.460 --> 11:01.659
      Oh, sure.                 

11:01.661 --> 11:03.527
I'm a statue fan                
from way back.                  

11:03.529 --> 11:07.298
I couldn't love statues more    
if I was a pigeon.              

11:08.900 --> 11:10.434
             I'll see you, Arch.
Yeah, Frank. Yeah.              

11:10.436 --> 11:12.035
     ARCHIE: And give our thanks
            to Irene            

11:12.037 --> 11:14.004
                 for loaning us 
            that statue, huh?   

11:14.006 --> 11:15.005
                    FRANK:      
                Okay, Archie.   

11:15.007 --> 11:17.441
    Yeah. <i>Arrivederci.</i>          

11:21.446 --> 11:22.680
            Oh, hi.             

11:22.682 --> 11:25.549
Uh, that was Frank Lorenzo      
      just come and left.       

11:25.551 --> 11:27.151
    I could see that.           

11:27.153 --> 11:29.820
And you gave him my statue      
        too, didn't you?        

11:29.822 --> 11:32.189
Well, the man came in here      

11:32.191 --> 11:34.958
     and he said that, uh,      
the statue was only a loan      

11:34.960 --> 11:37.428
     and he wanted it back,     
      so he took it away.       

11:37.430 --> 11:39.196
         That's a lie.          

11:39.198 --> 11:41.565
          Oh-ho, well,          
I don't have to stand here      

11:41.567 --> 11:43.967
         and listen to          
        talk like that.         

11:43.969 --> 11:47.004
Oh, yes, you do. I love         
that statue and so does Michael!

11:47.006 --> 11:48.739
It was our first                
real piece of art.              

11:48.741 --> 11:51.175
          What's going on       
              in here?          

11:51.177 --> 11:53.177
    What's going on in here     
 is your daughter standing here 

11:53.179 --> 11:54.912
calling her father a liar.      

11:54.914 --> 11:58.616
Gloria, you shouldn't talk      
to your father that way.        

11:58.618 --> 12:01.419
         Yes, I should.         
 He took something that I love. 

12:01.421 --> 12:05.756
Well, that ain't lying.         
That's stealing.                

12:05.758 --> 12:08.292
                        Will you
                         stifle?

12:08.294 --> 12:10.093
Don't help me                   
explain nothing, huh?           

12:10.095 --> 12:11.895
I got something to say to you,  
little girl,                    

12:11.897 --> 12:13.297
so you listen to me.            

12:13.299 --> 12:15.165
        No, you listen to me.   
No, I will not.                 

12:15.167 --> 12:16.801
            I am never gonna    
          listen to you again   

12:16.803 --> 12:18.569
        and you're never gonna  
         have the opportunity   

12:18.571 --> 12:20.037
to listen to me again either    

12:20.039 --> 12:23.273
because I am never going to     
speak to you again, never, ever!

12:23.275 --> 12:25.576
Glo-- Gloria!                   
Archie!                         

12:25.578 --> 12:31.716
Please don't fight!             
Not on Henry Mancini's birthday!

12:31.718 --> 12:34.885
            I'm sorry, Ma,      
     but I am not talking to him

12:34.887 --> 12:37.321
              and I may never   
             talk to him again. 

12:37.323 --> 12:38.656
                        What?   
      Oh, Gloria!               

12:38.658 --> 12:40.858
        No, don't go up         
         to your room!          

12:40.860 --> 12:43.494
Gloria!                         

12:43.496 --> 12:44.895
                  What's wrong? 

12:44.897 --> 12:47.798
What's wrong is                 
your wife, my daughter,         

12:47.800 --> 12:49.533
was standing here,              
calling me a liar.              

12:49.535 --> 12:51.134
And your mother-in-law,         
my wife,                        

12:51.136 --> 12:52.970
was standing here,              
letting her get away with it.   

12:52.972 --> 12:55.506
And now, there they are, up     
the stairs with the two of them.

12:57.108 --> 12:59.810
                Does this mean  
                 we don't eat?  

13:11.122 --> 13:12.823
            Gloria, pass me over
                the ketchup.    

13:16.428 --> 13:19.096
            I says, Gloria,     
    pass me over the ketchup.   

13:21.132 --> 13:23.967
              Get your hands off
             the ketchup, Edith.

13:27.372 --> 13:28.773
            I'll ask you        
          one more time, Gloria.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.107
                    Pass me over
                    the ketchup.

13:31.576 --> 13:32.576
            All right, Edith,   

13:32.578 --> 13:35.479
            you may pass me over
                the ketchup.    

13:38.983 --> 13:40.718
     I wanna tell you something,
             little girl.       

13:40.720 --> 13:43.921
 You ain't hurting me with this 
here silent treatment, you know?

13:43.923 --> 13:47.825
Of course, you're putting       
     your mother in misery.     

13:47.827 --> 13:49.359
        Look at the face        
            on her.             

13:57.168 --> 14:00.170
 Can't you show a little respect
      for your mother, huh?     

14:00.172 --> 14:02.773
                Be a little nice
                 to your mother?

14:02.775 --> 14:07.144
     Edith, what is this crapola
          you're giving me?     

14:07.146 --> 14:08.879
      It's a French dish,       
            Archie.             

14:08.881 --> 14:11.482
          It's called           
      potatoes au gratin.       

14:11.484 --> 14:13.083
          I don't care          
    what you call it.           

14:13.085 --> 14:15.786
Do you realize you spilled      
    cheese in the potatoes?     

14:15.788 --> 14:19.457
    Oh, no. The cheese          
    is supposed to be there.    

14:19.459 --> 14:21.291
        The recipe              
         called for it.         

14:21.293 --> 14:23.427
    Are you telling me          
 that somebody wrote in a book  

14:23.429 --> 14:26.196
    that you're supposed to     
put cheese in my potatoes?      

14:26.198 --> 14:27.598
      There you go again.       

14:27.600 --> 14:29.166
         Anything that          
    you haven't seen before,    

14:29.168 --> 14:30.801
  anything that's a little bit  
different, you're against.      

14:30.803 --> 14:32.002
    Before you were against     
          French art,           

14:32.004 --> 14:33.637
    now you're against          
        French cooking.         

14:33.639 --> 14:35.606
     Let me tell you this.      

14:35.608 --> 14:38.108
     Pbbbbt to the French.      

14:39.544 --> 14:40.945
         I'll tell you          
         something else         

14:40.947 --> 14:42.346
    about the French there,     
        wise guy.               

14:42.348 --> 14:44.949
     You know why they lost     
         World War II?          

14:46.585 --> 14:49.319
    Because when the Krauts     
was marching into their country,

14:49.321 --> 14:52.623
 the French was running around  
naked, putting up dirty statues 

14:52.625 --> 14:55.593
      and throwing cheese       
    in their potatoes.          

15:02.968 --> 15:07.371
But, Archie, how did the Germans
      know they was French      

15:07.373 --> 15:10.708
      if they didn't have       
         no clothes on?         

15:16.381 --> 15:18.616
        They knew               
    they was French, Edith,     

15:18.618 --> 15:21.151
    because they had cheese     
         all over them.         

15:24.823 --> 15:26.256
         Hi.                    

15:26.258 --> 15:27.658
         What do you mean, "hi"?

15:27.660 --> 15:29.627
                 Where you been?
                    It's 6:18.  

15:29.629 --> 15:32.295
Oh, I'm sorry, Frank.           
Were you worried?               

15:32.297 --> 15:33.697
            You bet             
         I was worried.         

15:33.699 --> 15:38.035
    My cheese soufflé has to    
 come out of the oven at 6:21.  

15:38.037 --> 15:39.870
     Well, I mentioned that     
    to the bus driver,          

15:39.872 --> 15:42.305
    but he didn't seem          
        very impressed.         

15:42.307 --> 15:43.807
                     Ha, ha, ha!

15:43.809 --> 15:45.242
                    Very funny. 

15:45.244 --> 15:46.810
              What's in the box?

15:46.812 --> 15:48.311
It's a present for Gloria.      

15:48.313 --> 15:49.880
        From both of us.        

15:49.882 --> 15:52.016
            You gave Gloria     
            another present?    

15:52.018 --> 15:53.751
            There you go.       
          You're doing it again.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.786
         How can you give Gloria
              a gift from us    

15:55.788 --> 15:57.354
             without asking me? 

15:57.356 --> 15:59.189
            Me is half of us.   

15:59.191 --> 16:01.792
I didn't think                  
you'd mind.                     

16:01.794 --> 16:02.893
                         I mind!

16:02.895 --> 16:05.362
Well, it's just kind of         
a peace offering.               

16:05.364 --> 16:07.932
  Well, it's not my fault that  
    that house is in uproar.    

16:07.934 --> 16:09.466
          My favorite           
      piece of sculpture,       

16:09.468 --> 16:11.635
and you give it to Gloria       
    without asking me.          

16:11.637 --> 16:13.037
You never ask me anything.      

16:13.039 --> 16:14.572
        Come on, Frank!         

16:14.574 --> 16:16.473
                    What's      
                the big deal?   

16:16.475 --> 16:18.108
                     I know you.

16:18.110 --> 16:21.045
If you'd seen Gloria's face     
 when she looked at that statue,

16:21.047 --> 16:22.546
             you'd have given it
            to her yourself.    

16:22.548 --> 16:23.948
Naturally, if I'd               
have seen her face.             

16:23.950 --> 16:25.348
    But I didn't                
    see her face.               

16:25.350 --> 16:27.618
You didn't ask me               
to see her face.                

16:27.620 --> 16:29.019
  But that's not                
    the point.                  

16:29.021 --> 16:31.254
The point is that you never     
ask me about anything.          

16:31.256 --> 16:33.557
You give my statue to Gloria    
without asking me,              

16:33.559 --> 16:35.593
you give her a gift             
without asking me,              

16:35.595 --> 16:38.562
you plan a trip for us          
to Cleveland without asking me. 

16:38.564 --> 16:40.464
         Well, don't you want to
            go see your sons?   

16:40.466 --> 16:42.900
Of course I do.                 
                     Okay. When?

16:42.902 --> 16:44.167
That's up to you.               

16:46.304 --> 16:49.139
                Up to me?       

16:49.141 --> 16:51.208
    You really are something,   
             you know that?     

16:51.210 --> 16:54.311
How am I supposed to know       
what things I should ask        

16:54.313 --> 16:55.946
and what things                 
I shouldn't ask?                

16:55.948 --> 16:58.782
          Just ask me.          

17:00.284 --> 17:01.785
      You're crazy, Frank.      
         You know that?         

17:01.787 --> 17:05.155
    How does anyone talk to     
    a raving Italian?           

17:05.156 --> 17:08.191
  "Raving Italian." There it is.
It all comes out in the open.   

17:08.193 --> 17:09.760
          After all these years.
What?                           

17:09.762 --> 17:12.561
  Oh, they told me. They told me
      before we got married.    

17:12.564 --> 17:14.564
        They said, "You marry   
        somebody who's Irish,   

17:14.566 --> 17:16.433
    "and someday you'll get into
        an argument with her    

17:16.435 --> 17:19.737
            and she's gonna say,
                'Aha! Wop!'"    

17:21.539 --> 17:24.141
    I didn't say                
    "Wop"!                      

17:24.143 --> 17:25.809
 I didn't even say              
    "Aha!"                      

17:25.810 --> 17:27.810
        But you were thinking   
                "Aha!"          

17:27.813 --> 17:29.312
                 And when you're
                 thinking "Aha!"

17:29.314 --> 17:31.281
                  can "Wop" be  
                  far behind?   

17:37.055 --> 17:38.789
              Gloria out there  
            in the living room? 

17:38.791 --> 17:40.891
No. She's                       
upstairs.                       

17:40.893 --> 17:45.663
Good. Now get over here, because
  I got something to show you.  

17:46.831 --> 17:48.666
    Got a little present here   
              for Gloria.       

17:48.668 --> 17:51.601
Oh! You bought something        
for Gloria?                     

17:51.603 --> 17:54.071
         Yeah, you know, kind of
         make it up to her, huh?

17:54.073 --> 17:56.907
      And because she's so crazy
            about statues,      

17:56.909 --> 17:59.677
            I got this one here.

18:03.815 --> 18:05.215
This is something               

18:05.217 --> 18:08.251
             that she can love  
        and we can all enjoy.   

18:08.253 --> 18:09.687
                      See?      
  Oh, yeah.                     

18:09.689 --> 18:12.322
That sure is                    
something.                      

18:13.391 --> 18:14.491
                Ain't that nice?

18:14.493 --> 18:16.093
             Now, look, up here 
            there's a hole, see,

18:16.095 --> 18:18.929
             where you can put  
        an artificial flower.   

18:18.931 --> 18:21.732
 And then here                  
you got a fish.                 

18:21.734 --> 18:23.600
Look at the detail work         
     on that. See?              

18:23.602 --> 18:27.104
You can tell right away that    
 that there is a carp. See?     

18:27.106 --> 18:29.272
 And up here,                   
with the birds,                 

18:29.274 --> 18:31.875
if you close your eyes, you can 
almost hear them singing there  

18:31.877 --> 18:34.712
while the colored lady          
  plays the ukulele.            

18:41.285 --> 18:44.654
     Now, for a person          
with a dirty mind, you know,    

18:44.656 --> 18:47.057
you look up around here         
 where the beads are.           

18:47.059 --> 18:50.227
But on this statue,             
this has got a clock, see?      

18:50.229 --> 18:54.098
So that takes the person's      
mind off these here.            

18:55.767 --> 18:58.035

Where you gonna put it?

Don't show your ignorance.      
 What do you think it is?       

19:28.000 --> 19:30.067
            I don't know,       
    but you better get it lanced

19:30.069 --> 19:32.202
                before it       
            starts festering.

    that's a work of art?       

19:39.211 --> 19:41.078
         I bought that          
in that fancy place, Carlson's, 

19:41.080 --> 19:42.479
          over on
