WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:05.738
Okay, everybody,
gather round.

00:05.740 --> 00:08.640
Who knew it was "bring
your girlfriend to work" day?

00:10.176 --> 00:12.444
She is not my girlfriend.

00:12.446 --> 00:13.979
Judy is a CPR doll,

00:13.981 --> 00:17.416
and the hardest-working girl
in this diner.

00:17.418 --> 00:21.820
Oh, Han, you shouldn't bring
your sex doll out in public.

00:21.822 --> 00:25.791
This is not my girlfriend
or sex doll!

00:25.793 --> 00:27.459
Earl, come over.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.962
We're going to use Judy
to learn how to resuscitate.

00:29.964 --> 00:32.631
I have a "do not resuscitate"
clause,

00:32.633 --> 00:35.968
as in,
I do not resuscitate others.

00:35.970 --> 00:37.436
Oleg.

00:37.438 --> 00:38.670
What's up, Han?

00:38.672 --> 00:40.072
Oh, hey, Judy.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.443
How do you know Judy?

00:44.445 --> 00:48.647
With a torso like that,
she gets around.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.116
Okay, I will demonstrate.

00:51.118 --> 00:52.551
Oh, no!

00:52.553 --> 00:55.654
Judy's choking on something!

00:55.656 --> 00:58.390
Well, we know it's not you.

00:59.826 --> 01:02.261
First you have to tilt
the head back

01:02.263 --> 01:04.530
and clear the airway
and blow.

01:04.532 --> 01:05.864
[gasps]

01:05.866 --> 01:07.433
Oh, Max, I think
we're witnessing

01:07.435 --> 01:10.636
his first kiss.

01:10.638 --> 01:13.639
Fourth, thank you very much.

01:13.641 --> 01:16.542
Han, why are you wasting
your time kissing her?

01:16.544 --> 01:17.776
She doesn't have any arms.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.478
Just go for it.

01:23.049 --> 01:25.150
(Peter Bjorn and John)
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh ¶

01:26.821 --> 01:30.522
¶ Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh ¶

01:36.429 --> 01:38.664
What's up, everybody?
Big day today.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.999
Not as big as Christmas,
but still marks the arrival

01:41.001 --> 01:44.503
of someone very blessed: me.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.504
Yeah, we get it.

01:45.506 --> 01:46.939
You talk about your birthday

01:46.941 --> 01:50.676
more than Kanye West
talks about Kanye West.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.679
Caroline, I thought
you would be crying.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.914
Tears on your birthday
have become as expected

01:55.916 --> 01:59.518
as an ex-Disney star going
to rehab.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.220
Why would I be sad?

02:01.222 --> 02:03.755
I have my health,
a business that's budding--

02:03.757 --> 02:07.092
Boobs that aren't.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.994
I don't believe in birthdays.

02:08.996 --> 02:11.096
You're only as old as you feel.

02:11.098 --> 02:13.298
Which makes me
nothing years old.

02:15.235 --> 02:17.736
Speaking of nothing...

02:17.738 --> 02:20.839
Caroline, are we still on
for Two Boots pizza tonight?

02:20.841 --> 02:23.709
I'm closing the diner early
in honor of your birthday,

02:23.711 --> 02:25.377
and just not because the city

02:25.379 --> 02:28.914
has demanded to look into
the black mold situation.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.749
Absolutely, Han.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.584
You can have one slice
with two toppings

02:32.586 --> 02:34.353
or two slices
with one topping,

02:34.355 --> 02:36.021
and my birthday cake
is a free flan

02:36.023 --> 02:38.857
'cause I flirted
with the dishwasher.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.893
Caroline, sweetheart,
if I was you,

02:40.895 --> 02:44.296
I would just put my head
through a plate glass window.

02:46.799 --> 02:48.267
Okay, everybody.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.969
I have two announcements,
both good news.

02:50.971 --> 02:53.906
First, the guy who found
the beak in his sandwich

02:53.908 --> 02:57.576
is not suing, and second,

02:57.578 --> 03:01.847
I'm gonna pop the question
to Sophie.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.183
Well, you've already popped
everything else.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.220
What do you think?

03:08.222 --> 03:10.389
They say diamonds
are a girl's best friend.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.557
Oh, really?

03:11.559 --> 03:13.025
I thought a girl's best friend

03:13.027 --> 03:14.927
was someone
just a little fatter than her.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.729
It was my grandma's
from Russia.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.464
I had my cousin Svela
swallow it

03:19.466 --> 03:21.633
to bring it to America.

03:21.635 --> 03:25.237
She passed customs,
then she passed this.

03:27.574 --> 03:31.043
Five, six rinses later,
boom!

03:31.045 --> 03:32.578
Doody free.

03:35.248 --> 03:39.251
Well, I guess that's better
than getting it at Kay.

03:39.253 --> 03:40.819
Is Sophie expecting it?

03:40.821 --> 03:41.853
Of course.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.222
She doesn't like surprises

03:43.224 --> 03:45.057
since her family barn
was torched

03:45.059 --> 03:48.060
by a mentally unstable
farmhand.

03:49.362 --> 03:51.930
Hi, I have a delivery
for Caroline Channing

03:51.932 --> 03:53.265
from Martin Channing.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.766
Oh, it's a birthday gift
from my daddy

03:54.768 --> 03:55.901
all the way from prison.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.169
Last year, he made me

03:57.171 --> 04:00.005
a macaroni art
picture frame.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.441
I mean,
the man once rented Miami

04:02.443 --> 04:05.410
for a friend's bachelor party.

04:05.412 --> 04:09.281
Hey, that picture frame
fed us for two days.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.782
Yeah, well,
this thing is not pasta,

04:10.784 --> 04:12.985
and it's too big
to fit through the door.

04:12.987 --> 04:15.854
And so was I
three months ago.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.356
No, really.

04:17.358 --> 04:20.859
My seat on an airplane
used to be Row Three.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.499
There it is
in the street.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.668
A condom full of hamburger meat?

04:29.670 --> 04:30.936
Oh, my God.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.971
Is that a Lamborghini?

04:32.973 --> 04:34.206
Wait.

04:34.208 --> 04:36.341
Is that<i> my</i> Lamborghini?

04:36.343 --> 04:40.979
Yeah, it's a Lamborghini
Aventador Roadster.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.447
Wow.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.951
Prison arts and crafts
has gotten pretty fancy.

04:45.953 --> 04:49.288
Well, it takes four years for
these cars to be custom-made.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.956
This one was ordered in 2011.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.724
That's right,
my father ordered this for me

04:52.726 --> 04:54.359
when he still had money.

04:54.361 --> 04:57.896
Correction: When he had
everyone else's money.

04:57.898 --> 05:02.100
All my father ever gave me
was that one iffy chromosome.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.802
Well, here you go.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.371
It's all yours.

05:06.373 --> 05:07.439
I'm gonna walk home.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.541
It's all about healthy choices.

05:11.577 --> 05:13.712
[both squealing]

05:14.647 --> 05:15.647
I got a car!

05:15.649 --> 05:17.883
We got a car!

05:24.590 --> 05:30.295
Damn, someone painted
the Batmobile white.

05:30.297 --> 05:33.632
Can't we have anything?

05:35.935 --> 05:39.237
That's a $450,000 sports car.

05:39.239 --> 05:40.672
I know.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.507
Add a stackable washer/dryer
and a motor home,

05:42.509 --> 05:45.644
and it's like Caroline won
the Showcase Showdown.

05:45.646 --> 05:49.414
It goes from 0 to 100
in 2.9 seconds.

05:49.416 --> 05:50.782
And speaking of seconds,

05:50.784 --> 05:52.117
I'm getting seconds
at Two Boots,

05:52.119 --> 05:54.553
and that rich bitch is paying.

05:55.888 --> 05:57.823
Back off, Tokyo Drift.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.662
This is our getaway car.

06:03.664 --> 06:06.898
And by that,
I mean get away from it.

06:06.900 --> 06:10.068
You know, a car like this
depreciates 50%

06:10.070 --> 06:12.371
the minute you drive it
off the lot.

06:12.373 --> 06:15.607
That's why I drive
my Toyota Yaris.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.010
Ooh la la.

06:19.012 --> 06:22.614
[gasps]
Is P. Diddy here?

06:22.616 --> 06:25.951
Wait a minute.
Is it Ted Turner?

06:25.953 --> 06:27.519
No one cool owns it.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.187
It's Caroline's.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.922
Now, this is the kind of car

06:30.924 --> 06:34.426
that I would say yes
to anything in.

06:34.428 --> 06:38.964
Anything excepts tickets
to<i> Menopause The Musical.</i>

06:40.533 --> 06:43.201
Oh, hey, Caroline.
Nice car.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.070
I always liked you
more than Max.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.873
You know that, right,
girl?

06:47.875 --> 06:49.241
Really?

06:49.243 --> 06:50.909
'Cause yesterday,
I heard you yell to Max,

06:50.911 --> 06:53.879
[imitating Sophie]
"Is Caroline turning 47 or 48?

06:53.881 --> 06:57.716
'Cause she acts like she's 65."

06:57.718 --> 07:00.185
Yeah.

07:00.187 --> 07:04.156
Yeah, I wanted to know what
to write in your birthday card.

07:04.158 --> 07:06.491
Well, everyone
away from the car.

07:06.493 --> 07:07.859
I just got off the phone
with my dad.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.661
The car is being seized
in the morning.

07:09.663 --> 07:12.063
Turns out they won't let me
keep my present.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.398
It's just like
my eighth birthday

07:13.400 --> 07:16.902
when they made me return
Mccaulay Culkin.

07:21.541 --> 07:25.544
They bought you a boy?

07:25.546 --> 07:28.013
You were rich.

07:28.015 --> 07:31.550
Oh, boy, the car's right here,
and you can't even use it.

07:31.552 --> 07:34.920
That's like me having you two
for waitresses.

07:39.859 --> 07:42.060
Caroline, can I ask you
a favor?

07:42.062 --> 07:45.096
You're not using the car
to propose to Sophie.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.898
You heard how much
she liked it.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.601
And it's a little bit classier
than my original plan:

07:49.603 --> 07:52.771
dinner and a cock fight
in Yonkers.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.106
Not that I'm listening,

07:55.108 --> 07:59.644
but I'm not gonna get
proposed to at a gay bar.

07:59.646 --> 08:03.915
Great, now my gay bar idea
is out also.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.484
No, Oleg.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.519
I can't return the car
with scratches, dents,

08:07.521 --> 08:10.822
or chlamydia.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.524
But we can still drive it,
right?

08:12.526 --> 08:14.926
I mean, I've been on that cream
for like a month.

08:20.666 --> 08:23.034
Max, what is the ninth rule
of the Lamborghini Club?

08:23.036 --> 08:25.604
No red drinks
in the car.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.539
Here's my number one rule:

08:27.541 --> 08:29.307
If you're going to make me
sleep in it,

08:29.309 --> 08:31.776
I am going to drink in it.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.178
Well, just be careful.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.646
I only have one Clorox wipe

08:34.648 --> 08:36.781
that has to last
till my next birthday,

08:36.783 --> 08:39.184
and it's already lost
a lot of its moisture.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.222
I don't see
why we have to just sit here.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.490
We can't drive it.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.225
My dad said
if anything happens to it,

08:47.227 --> 08:48.527
we'll be responsible.

08:48.529 --> 08:49.961
What could possibly happen

08:49.963 --> 08:53.632
on a weed run
to deep Tijuana?

08:53.634 --> 08:55.367
You know, I wish
this car never came,

08:55.369 --> 08:56.968
and I wish I never sat in it.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.737
It's the same reason
I don't go to Barneys.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.439
I don't like to be around things
I can't afford anymore.

09:01.441 --> 09:04.643
Same reason I don't go
to the 99 Cent Store.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.211
There's a Nerf tennis set

09:06.213 --> 09:08.480
half on the floor,
half in the bin,

09:08.482 --> 09:11.550
none of it going home with me.

09:11.552 --> 09:14.252
I was trying to be positive
about my birthday this year,

09:14.254 --> 09:16.955
but, Max, if things
hadn't happened with my father,

09:16.957 --> 09:19.157
tonight would have been
a magical birthday for me.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.892
Hey, there was some magic.

09:20.894 --> 09:24.829
I personally made
five vodka Sprites disappear.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.932
Ta-da!

09:26.934 --> 09:29.601
I would've got in the car
and driven out to the Hamptons,

09:29.603 --> 09:31.469
and we'd sit on the beach
all night

09:31.471 --> 09:33.605
having lobster caught by
one of the townies

09:33.607 --> 09:36.808
and drink champagne
while taking duckface selfies

09:36.810 --> 09:38.510
till the sun came up.

09:41.113 --> 09:44.249
FYI, I'm the townie
in this scenario,

09:44.251 --> 09:46.318
and I hate all of you.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.621
Instead of doing any of that,
I'm having the worst birthday.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.256
I probably feel worse
than Demi Moore did

09:51.258 --> 09:54.459
when she turned 50.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.962
Yes, just go to sleep.

09:56.964 --> 09:59.364
You'll feel better tomorrow
when you wake up.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.032
I mean, if that guy
with the switchblade

10:01.034 --> 10:03.068
doesn't come back
like he promised he would.

10:09.175 --> 10:11.142
Caroline.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.377
Caroline, wake up.

10:12.379 --> 10:15.347
[water crashing]

10:15.349 --> 10:16.481
We're at the beach.

10:16.483 --> 10:20.118
I drove us out
to the Hamptons.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.554
Happy birthday!

10:22.556 --> 10:27.058
We're in the Hamptons?

10:27.060 --> 10:30.662
[shouting]
We're in the Hamptons?

10:30.664 --> 10:32.697
How are we in the Hamptons?

10:32.699 --> 10:34.566
How long have I been sleeping?

10:34.568 --> 10:36.368
Three hours, give or take.

10:36.370 --> 10:39.070
You farted twice.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.972
How did I not wake up?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.941
I know.
It was pretty bad.

10:45.378 --> 10:49.648
After that last one, I thought
we were going through Egg Town.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.717
Max, you did it again.

10:52.719 --> 10:54.486
You roofied me, didn't you?

10:54.488 --> 10:56.788
Of course I did.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.224
You were crying
and babbling about the Hamptons,

10:59.226 --> 11:01.626
so I had to put you down.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.828
You promised you wouldn't again.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.997
The last time,
I was out for two days.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.433
Yeah, I really just needed
to get through<i> Game of Thrones</i>

11:08.435 --> 11:11.703
without someone
talking during the incest.

11:14.140 --> 11:16.241
What is wrong with you?

11:16.243 --> 11:19.177
Have you got a pen and paper?

11:19.179 --> 11:21.146
You knew I didn't want
to do this.

11:21.148 --> 11:24.582
You never want to do anything,
so I did it for you.

11:24.584 --> 11:27.952
You took a $450,000 car,

11:27.954 --> 11:31.456
a car we're not even
supposed to be touching,

11:31.458 --> 11:33.792
on a joyride to the Hamptons?

11:33.794 --> 11:37.262
You wanted to be here.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.329
You are here.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.497
Just enjoy it.

11:39.499 --> 11:42.434
I can't enjoy it.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.270
Scotty to the bridge.

11:45.272 --> 11:46.538
This is Captain Kirk.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.073
Scotty to the bridge.

11:51.143 --> 11:55.313
You drove over the dunes
and onto the beach?

11:55.315 --> 11:57.515
Not intentionally.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.584
I tried to stop it,
but this car was like,

11:59.586 --> 12:01.319
"Mm, no, girl."

12:03.889 --> 12:05.356
Oh, my God.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.759
Did it get any scratches?

12:07.761 --> 12:11.463
Max, get out of the car,
and help me look for scratches.

12:11.465 --> 12:15.867
You said you were more fun
in the Hamptons.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.036
Not true.

12:18.971 --> 12:23.108
Mr. Sulu,
fire all phasers.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.977
No scratches.
The Lamborghini is fine.

12:25.979 --> 12:29.180
But thanks to you,
I'm a Rent-A-Wreck.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.319
Come on, we have to get
this car back.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.054
We will.
Jeez, relax.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.288
We still have time.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.624
Look, you said
you wanted to be here.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.326
You're here,
and we are not leaving

12:41.328 --> 12:42.660
till you do something beach-y,

12:42.662 --> 12:44.662
like walk in the water

12:44.664 --> 12:49.134
or find a half-eaten lady
from<i> Jaws.</i>

12:49.136 --> 12:51.503
No. No way.
Let's go.

12:51.505 --> 12:52.737
Just take off your shoes
or something.

12:52.739 --> 12:54.172
No.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.840
Just take off your shoes
and feel the sand.

12:55.842 --> 12:57.075
Max! Max, stop.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.877
I haven't had a proper pedicure

12:58.879 --> 13:01.146
since Justin Timberlake
released a single.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.815
There.
Now move your foot around.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.150
No.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.085
No. No! No.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.520
Oh. Oh, yeah.

13:08.522 --> 13:11.156
That feels nice.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.091
The cold sand between my toes.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.492
But, Max, don't look.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.528
That middle nail's
a horror show.

13:16.530 --> 13:17.829
Too late.

13:17.831 --> 13:22.066
I thought it was a pistachio
for a second.

13:22.068 --> 13:24.702
Max, how much do you love
the beach?

13:24.704 --> 13:26.905
I don't know.
I've never been to one.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.773
You've never been to a beach?

13:28.775 --> 13:30.375
No. What's the point?

13:30.377 --> 13:32.243
I don't own a metal detector.

13:35.414 --> 13:37.248
Well, time's up.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.883
But we just sat down.

13:38.885 --> 13:40.451
I know, but if we leave
right now,

13:40.453 --> 13:42.420
we'll still have enough time to
blow through

13:42.422 --> 13:43.922
a McDonald's drive-through

13:43.924 --> 13:47.025
like something from
<i>Back to the Future.</i>

13:47.027 --> 13:49.027
Well, I'm gonna write
our names in the sand

13:49.029 --> 13:50.628
'cause it was
a really nice thing

13:50.630 --> 13:52.197
for you to drug me, kidnap me,

13:52.199 --> 13:55.033
and steal my car
to get me out here.

13:55.035 --> 13:58.503
Hey, we're friends.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.772
All right, I'll just
turn this baby around.

14:00.774 --> 14:04.809
[engine revving]

14:04.811 --> 14:05.877
Uh-oh.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.548
What's "uh-oh"?

14:10.550 --> 14:13.384
What is "uh-oh"?

14:13.386 --> 14:15.720
Are we stuck in the sand?

14:15.722 --> 14:20.625
You have correctly identified
the meaning of "uh-oh."

14:20.627 --> 14:22.493
I love that we don't need
full sentences

14:22.495 --> 14:25.029
to communicate anymore.

14:32.171 --> 14:33.404
Try it again.

14:33.406 --> 14:36.007
[engine revving]

14:36.009 --> 14:37.008
Nope.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.409
I've had less trouble

14:38.411 --> 14:40.345
getting out of
athlete's apartments.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.313
Well, you're gonna have to
get out and push.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.015
Why do I have to push?

14:44.017 --> 14:46.985
Because you're the one
who drugged me, kidnapped me,

14:46.987 --> 14:48.219
and stole my car.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.988
Exactly.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.557
I've already done
the lion's share of the work.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.559
And it's our car.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.060
Fine, I'll do it.
[engine stops]

14:58.664 --> 15:01.065
Door's up, Lieutenant Uhura.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.802
It stopped being funny
when we got stuck.

15:04.804 --> 15:06.504
God, don't worry.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.273
I got a 600-pound woman

15:08.275 --> 15:10.108
out of a booth at the diner
with my bare hands.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.643
I'm fearless.

15:11.645 --> 15:15.947
Toss her in neutral
like I did with that lady.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.249
Sand and heels.
Not a good combo.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.985
Not a good combo.
Not a good combo.

15:20.987 --> 15:23.454
Oh, all right.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.690
All right.

15:25.692 --> 15:26.691
I'm gonna floor it.

15:26.693 --> 15:27.959
[engine revs]

15:27.961 --> 15:28.993
On the count of three.

15:28.995 --> 15:30.795
One, two...

15:30.797 --> 15:33.865
[engine revving]

15:40.339 --> 15:43.274
I got excited.
I went early.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.878
If I had a dime
for every time I heard that,

15:46.880 --> 15:48.780
I could buy this car.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.682
All right, let's try again.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.450
One, two...

15:52.452 --> 15:55.586
[engine revving]

16:04.630 --> 16:07.031
[coughs]

16:07.033 --> 16:09.634
Okay, that was on purpose.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.470
A little bit.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.938
I can't believe it.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.640
I can't believe
that I can't believe it,

16:15.642 --> 16:17.909
but I really can't believe it.

16:17.911 --> 16:19.577
We are in very big trouble,

16:19.579 --> 16:22.880
and we're not even in
the good Hamptons.

16:22.882 --> 16:25.583
I was trying to do
something nice.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.720
First time, last time.

16:28.722 --> 16:30.588
You know what you are?

16:30.590 --> 16:32.223
You are reckless.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.092
You know, all this time,

16:34.094 --> 16:37.061
I thought you were
a ride or die kind of bitch.

16:37.063 --> 16:42.800
I am a ride or die
kind of bitch.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.702
What's a ride or die
kind of bitch?

16:46.171 --> 16:50.575
Are you Googling
"ride or die kind of bitch"?

16:50.577 --> 16:54.345
I would be,
but I only have two bars.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.346
[sighs]

16:55.348 --> 16:58.049
Look, we have two options:

16:58.051 --> 17:01.986
Get the car out of the sand,
or let the tide take us.

17:01.988 --> 17:03.888
Put a pin in
that tide thing,

17:03.890 --> 17:06.524
'cause I like the sound of it.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.760
We barely have enough time to
get this car back to the city,

17:08.762 --> 17:11.195
or we owe $450,000.

17:11.197 --> 17:15.733
And I only have $3,
and 2 of it's in nickels.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.235
Now get in the car.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.003
You're hoarding nickels,

17:19.005 --> 17:23.274
and I'm walking out of
the 99 Cent Store empty-handed?

17:23.276 --> 17:25.943
Now I'm mad.

17:25.945 --> 17:27.745
Get ready.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.180
What are you doing?

17:29.182 --> 17:30.948
I'm pushing us out of here.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.917
[engine turns over, revs]

17:32.919 --> 17:37.255
Because I'm a ride or die
kind of bitch!

17:37.257 --> 17:39.724
I think.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.025
[grunts]

17:41.027 --> 17:42.026
Now hit it!

17:42.028 --> 17:45.096
[engine revving]

17:51.603 --> 17:54.572
What'd you do?
Fart us out of the ditch?

17:56.608 --> 17:58.476
Seriously, Caroline,
step on it.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.977
No, Max.

17:59.979 --> 18:01.879
We can't risk
getting into an accident.

18:01.881 --> 18:05.116
What if it's not fatal?

18:05.118 --> 18:08.352
Driving a Lamborghini slow
is like going to Red Lobster

18:08.354 --> 18:11.022
and not getting
the Cheddar Bay biscuits.

18:11.024 --> 18:13.324
Come on, we got to enjoy
this car while we can.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.959
Hit the gas.
- All right.

18:14.961 --> 18:17.395
I'll take it up to the top
of my age dating window.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.963
40.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.898
And I'll take it
to the top of mine.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.166

- [engine revving]

18:22.168 --> 18:23.401

18:29.909 --> 18:32.243
Best birthday ever!

18:32.245 --> 18:34.078
Should we Thelma and Louise it?

18:34.080 --> 18:36.214
You mean drive over a cliff?

18:36.216 --> 18:39.217
No, I mean wear sunglasses
and hold hands.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.485
They drive over a cliff?

18:40.487 --> 18:41.986
I never saw the end.

18:52.431 --> 18:54.165
There they are.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.467
Did you girls get the car back
in time this morning?

18:56.469 --> 18:58.836
Yep, just in time,
thanks to Caroline.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.671
She was ignoring
speed limit signs

19:00.673 --> 19:04.008
like she does homeless people.

A state trooper called
my driving

19:05.512 --> 19:08.112
criminally negligent.

19:08.114 --> 19:10.281
I was so proud.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.782
I might've even
gotten emotional,

19:11.784 --> 19:13.417
but I had to talk our way
out of the ticket,

19:13.419 --> 19:15.453
and I like to be professional
when my shirt's off.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.188
[chuckles]

19:17.190 --> 19:19.023
You didn't get a ticket?

19:19.025 --> 19:23.027
Yesterday, I got arrested for
just walking into Whole Foods.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.830
I can't believe
I still have sand in my hair.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.865
If the only place you still
have sand is in your hair,

19:27.867 --> 19:29.333
you're lucky.

19:29.335 --> 19:32.503
I'm about to make a pearl
down there.

destitute Barbie.

19:38.777 --> 19:41.045
Sorry you lost the dream car.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.714
Anyway, I'll be in my booth.

the site of my proposal

to three options:

19:52.892 --> 19:55.126
A, the place we met;

19:55.128 --> 19:59.163
B, the place we've had sex
most often;

19:59.165 --> 20:03.067
or C, the place we've had sex
most recently.

20:03.069 --> 20:07.338
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

20:07.340 --> 20:11.442
All three of those places
are this booth!

Put an onion ring on it?

You know, I was planning on
saying no

and making you beg
for a few hours...

20:45.345 --> 20:47.745
I just love you too much.

20:52.351 --> 20:57.388
Aw, that's so
not as gross as normal.

Now it is.
