Because the first date,
we got drunk and had sex.

She was a singer, right?

15:06.322 --> 15:07.615
Yeah, she was a singer.

you from, by the way?

24:16.705 --> 24:20.834

got together in this time zone,

24:39.728 --> 24:41.354

you're gonna be naked,
penniless, and running!

the paintings are on our side.
Come on.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.085
HENRY, 28: You know what I love
about art, is people look at it.

25:04.169 --> 25:07.964
Meanwhile, we look at people,
and figure out where
they're keeping their wallets.

25:08.048 --> 25:11.968
Now, most men keep
their wallets in either
their back pocket, like that,

25:12.052 --> 25:13.762
or the inside pocket
of their suit jacket.

25:13.762 --> 25:16.598

their purse behind their back.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.017
My mom's dead.

25:19.017 --> 25:22.604
Now, if you're on the street,
you can grab a purse
or a wallet, and just run.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.314
But if you're
in a place like this,

25:24.314 --> 25:26.024
you need to take it
without them noticing,

25:26.024 --> 25:29.069
and without anyone
else noticing, either.
You ready to try?

25:29.069 --> 25:32.864

it was my personality.

25:50.465 --> 25:52.259

27:34.486 --> 27:37.655
Warn her. Tell her something
that's gonna save her,
but it won't work.

27:37.739 --> 27:38.740
Why not?

27:40.116 --> 27:41.576
HENRY, 28:
<i>Because it never works.</i>

27:42.994 --> 27:44.245
You tried, though.

27:46.122 --> 27:47.165
Yeah, I guess.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.753
So, come on. Tell me.

27:53.546 --> 27:54.547
Why?

27:55.465 --> 27:57.092
Because I want to know.

27:57.092 --> 28:00.011
And this is the day,
and I'm asking nicely.

28:01.846 --> 28:03.139
I want to know you.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.854
You can't change anything.

28:10.980 --> 28:13.066
And you can't save anyone.

28:13.066 --> 28:15.151
- HENRY, 8: <i>Why not?</i>
- Because you can't!

28:18.863 --> 28:21.366
- And I can prove it to you.
- Okay, prove it!

28:22.492 --> 28:24.160
I know a little piece
of your future.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.914
Never mind how, but I do.

28:29.916 --> 28:33.753
In a little under a minute,
you're gonna get out of that
chair and run in that direction.

28:33.837 --> 28:36.756
- Why?
- Because that's what's gonna happen, you're gonna do that.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.091
Is there gonna be a fire alarm?

28:38.091 --> 28:39.884
- No fire alarm.
- Then why would I do that?

28:39.968 --> 28:43.555
It will be your choice.
Entirely your own decision.
No one's gonna force you.

28:43.555 --> 28:48.143
- Are you gonna make me?
- HENRY, 28: It will be your decision, I promise you.

28:48.143 --> 28:52.272
Just because it's your decision,
doesn't mean you can
stop yourself from making it.

28:52.272 --> 28:55.275
- I'm not doing it! I'm not.
- Prove me wrong, huh?

28:55.275 --> 28:56.901
Prove me wrong,
and keep sitting there!

28:56.985 --> 28:58.445
- I'm not gonna get up!
- Good for you!

28:58.445 --> 29:00.530
- Even if there's a real fire!
- There's not gonna be a real fire!

29:00.530 --> 29:02.449
- I'm staying right here!
- Me, too!

29:08.037 --> 29:09.038
How long?

29:13.751 --> 29:14.919
About 30 seconds.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.172
- Okay, I'm not getting out this seat!
- No, you're not.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.966
No one gets out
a seat if they think
it's gonna kill their mom!

29:22.677 --> 29:24.137
It's not your fault.

29:26.139 --> 29:27.307
It's not changeable.

29:29.267 --> 29:30.810
Sometimes,
I think you were there.

29:30.894 --> 29:32.770
- HENRY, 28: Where?
- When my mom--

29:34.022 --> 29:36.858
You put a blanket around me.
Did you do that?

29:44.324 --> 29:45.492
How long now?

29:50.246 --> 29:53.249
See the woman in the
green skirt heading towards us?

29:55.043 --> 29:56.085
Okay.

29:57.629 --> 30:00.882
HENRY, 28:
Before she gets here, you're
gonna run in that direction.

30:09.849 --> 30:10.975
Oh, I'm so sorry.

30:13.353 --> 30:14.354
Mom!

30:16.105 --> 30:18.024
Mom!

30:21.444 --> 30:22.737
Mom!

30:26.032 --> 30:28.535
What are you doing? Henry?

30:28.535 --> 30:31.412
You're supposed to be in school!
Why aren't you in school, Henry?

30:31.955 --> 30:33.498
Mom, I'm sorry.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.375
Oh my god, what happened?
Are you okay?

30:35.375 --> 30:38.127
- HENRY, 8: Mom.
- What are you wearing?

30:38.211 --> 30:40.463
Mom.
Oh god, why are you doing this again?

30:40.547 --> 30:42.840
- HENRY, 8: Mom!
- Why can't you just stay in school?

30:42.924 --> 30:44.676
- HENRY, 8: Mom.
- You are in such trouble!

30:44.676 --> 30:47.637
Sorry. Mom!
No. No. No, look, "I'm sorry" isn't good enough.

30:47.637 --> 30:49.847
Mom, listen to me.
Do you have any idea how many times

30:49.931 --> 30:51.599
your father and I have been
to the principal's office?

30:51.683 --> 30:53.768
- Mom, you need to listen to me.
- You have to listen to me.

30:53.768 --> 30:55.478
Where do you go?
Why do you leave
your clothes behind?

30:55.562 --> 30:57.981
- HENRY, 8: Mom.
- Where did you get these-- Did you steal these clothes?

30:57.981 --> 31:00.108
- Mom!
- Why can't you just tell me what's going on?

31:00.108 --> 31:02.902
- Mom, I'm sorry.
- Mom, you need to listen to me.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.571
HENRY, 8:
Mom, you need to listen...

31:05.738 --> 31:06.823
<i>listen to me.</i>

31:09.284 --> 31:11.661
Please just listen to me.

31:11.661 --> 31:14.998
- But I love you.
- No! That's not gonna cut it.

31:14.998 --> 31:18.418
You can't just get around me
like that. We're gonna have
a serious conversation!

31:18.418 --> 31:22.130
- HENRY, 8: Mom!
- As far as she was concerned, I was skipping school yet again,

31:22.130 --> 31:24.299
and she'd caught me in the act.

31:24.299 --> 31:27.385
She didn't know
she was dead, and I was
trying to bring her back.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.470
Mom, you need to listen--
No! No!

31:29.554 --> 31:32.640
You need to listen to me,
'cause this is the tenth time.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.101
You never tell us
where you're going, or why.

31:35.101 --> 31:39.105
And do you know
how dangerous that could be,
just roaming about the place?

31:39.105 --> 31:42.400
Do you have any idea
how worried I am about you?

31:43.192 --> 31:44.777
What if you never saw me again?

31:44.861 --> 31:48.615
What if this was
the last time we could ever,
ever talk, and you just shouted?

31:48.615 --> 31:50.700
Don't threaten me with that!

31:50.700 --> 31:52.744
- What is the matter with you?
- HENRY, 8: Mom, please--

31:52.744 --> 31:55.079
We worry. We try to understand.
Just help us!

31:55.163 --> 31:56.789
You all buckled up?

31:56.873 --> 32:00.001
Henry... Did you do that?

32:00.001 --> 32:04.714
Whatever is happening
to you, just tell us!
If there is something botheri--

32:06.341 --> 32:07.550
- Tell us!
- Mom!

32:07.634 --> 32:08.801
Mom!

32:08.885 --> 32:12.347
I'm gonna tell you
and I'm gonna tell you
the truth.

32:12.347 --> 32:13.681
But you've got to believe me.

32:13.765 --> 32:17.185
You've got to really, really try
and believe me, please!

32:20.271 --> 32:22.815
I'm a time traveler.
I've come from the future.

32:22.899 --> 32:24.609
I need to tell you something
really important.

32:24.609 --> 32:27.278
And if you listen to me,
it will save your life.

32:29.030 --> 32:32.241
Henry, I need you to take
this seriously right now.

32:32.325 --> 32:33.534
I need you to just stop it.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.995
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

32:40.083 --> 32:43.211
I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!

32:43.211 --> 32:44.379
Henry!

32:45.755 --> 32:48.633
Henry!

32:49.550 --> 32:50.718
Henry!

33:07.944 --> 33:11.864
Richard...
You won't believe this.
He did it again.

33:15.493 --> 33:16.619
HENRY, 28:
Henry.

33:23.292 --> 33:26.879
What do you mean he's in class?
But how can he be there now?

33:26.963 --> 33:30.341
He was just here
a few minutes ago.
How can he be at school?

33:32.343 --> 33:33.928
Well, geez...

33:33.928 --> 33:35.763
how fast do you
think he can run?

33:35.847 --> 33:37.557
She's gonna give you hell
about this tonight.

33:37.557 --> 33:39.350
You won't know
what she's talking about.

33:40.184 --> 33:42.478
- I remember.
- HENRY, 28: So do I.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.148
Whoa, whoa!

33:45.148 --> 33:47.984
Oh, my--

33:49.277 --> 33:50.737
Are you all right, ma'am?

33:52.864 --> 33:54.866
It's okay. It's fine.

33:55.658 --> 33:56.659
Today's not the day.

33:57.994 --> 34:00.163
- I said I hated her.
- I know.

34:01.497 --> 34:03.332
I could walk up
to her right now.

34:03.416 --> 34:05.877
I could prove to her
that I'm in two places
at the same time.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.921
Whatever you try to do,
something's gonna stop you.

34:09.922 --> 34:10.965
You know that.

34:25.688 --> 34:28.232
- So, we're going to your work?
- Yeah.

34:28.316 --> 34:31.152
It's a Sunday. It's shut.
We can sneak in, have a look.

34:31.652 --> 34:32.653
At what?

34:32.737 --> 34:35.364
Well, you keep asking
about my mom.

34:35.448 --> 34:37.158
I thought maybe
you'd like to meet her.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.286
Come on.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.123
HENRY, 8:
<i>Where are we going?</i>

34:44.207 --> 34:46.209
- HENRY, 28: Today's the day.
- HENRY, 8: What day?

34:46.209 --> 34:49.003
You said you wanted to meet
the other time travelers, right?

34:49.003 --> 34:50.671
HENRY, 8:
We're gonna meet them now?

34:50.755 --> 34:52.840
Yeah, we're gonna meet them.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.300
We're gonna meet all of them.

35:02.308 --> 35:03.935
CLARE, 20:
It's amazing.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.229
HENRY, 28: Sometimes, I wonder
if I'm in here somewhere.

35:07.355 --> 35:08.689
CLARE, 20:
You're in here every day.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.650
HENRY, 28:
No, in the books.

35:12.109 --> 35:13.820
I wonder if I'm
in any of the books.

35:15.404 --> 35:19.575
You know,
some future version of myself
gets stuck in the past.

35:19.659 --> 35:22.203
Someone writes about it.

35:23.871 --> 35:25.623
Puts me in a book.

35:25.623 --> 35:28.209
A piece of my future
could be here somewhere...

35:28.209 --> 35:30.169
gathering dust on a shelf.

35:30.253 --> 35:32.338
Things I haven't done yet.

35:32.338 --> 35:35.049
Words I haven't spoken,
decisions I'm...

35:36.008 --> 35:37.218
yet to make...

35:37.218 --> 35:39.929
already...
written, printed, and bound.

35:41.472 --> 35:42.849
If only I knew where to look.

35:45.226 --> 35:46.269
CLARE, 20:
What's that?

35:46.811 --> 35:48.104
Memories.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.272
CLARE, 20:
Of what?

35:50.314 --> 35:51.315
My mom.

35:55.778 --> 35:58.739
What's it doing here?
Who are you hiding it from?

36:00.241 --> 36:01.868
From me.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.786
I can't keep it at home,
it's too tempting.

36:04.453 --> 36:05.496
Tempting?

36:07.373 --> 36:08.457
If I'm, uh...

36:09.125 --> 36:10.751
stressed, or...

36:12.003 --> 36:13.504
depressed, or just...

36:14.088 --> 36:16.173
fuckin' drunk...

36:16.257 --> 36:21.012
I can't afford to let
myself fixate on the past,
or I wind up back there.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.222
CLARE, 20: Well, you get to see
your mom again.

36:23.306 --> 36:24.432
It's not all bad.

36:25.266 --> 36:28.227
Uh... depends what you see.

36:31.898 --> 36:34.442
What about your dad?
Is he still around?

36:34.442 --> 36:35.902
He's around.

36:35.902 --> 36:37.111
We don't talk much.

36:38.446 --> 36:39.572
Why not?

36:39.572 --> 36:40.740
Why should we?

36:42.408 --> 36:44.452
Tragedy usually brings
people together.

36:45.870 --> 36:48.789
If that were even half-true,
the whole world
would be friends.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.708
Hey.

36:52.793 --> 36:53.920
You wanna hear her sing?

36:55.755 --> 36:56.839
Yeah.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.261
I said we weren't friends.
Why do you think that is?

37:05.848 --> 37:07.475
It's okay.
No one's gonna come in.

37:07.475 --> 37:08.935
How do you know?

37:08.935 --> 37:10.144
Because no one did.

37:11.187 --> 37:12.438
Why aren't we friends?

37:12.438 --> 37:15.066
- Because you don't like me.
- Yeah, but why don't I like you?

37:16.859 --> 37:18.653
- I don't know.
- You do.

37:20.696 --> 37:21.781
You do.

37:22.698 --> 37:24.492
Now, come here.
Look in the mirror.

37:27.036 --> 37:28.079
Look at me.

37:29.455 --> 37:30.539
Then look at you.

37:32.875 --> 37:35.753
Come on, how long
have we been doing this?
How many lessons now?

37:35.753 --> 37:38.255
- You only ever teach me mean stuff.
- Survival skills!

37:38.339 --> 37:41.175
- Beating people up?
- Dumpster diving, tree climbing,

37:41.259 --> 37:42.843
venetian blinds
deployed as weapons.

37:42.927 --> 37:46.764
I know you're gonna
need all those things,
those specific things.

37:46.764 --> 37:48.140
How do I know that?

37:50.434 --> 37:54.063
- Henry?

A week later, she was dead.

39:31.118 --> 39:34.371
It must be a comfort...
hearing her sing.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.749
No, it's beautiful.

39:39.376 --> 39:41.504
Beauty's not comfort.

39:41.504 --> 39:44.632
<i>Hello ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so much. Thank you--</i>

39:45.216 --> 39:46.258
What's wrong?

39:47.510 --> 39:51.013
I-- I've never even listened
to this recording before.

39:51.472 --> 39:52.640
Why not?

39:52.640 --> 39:56.477
For you, old photographs,
keepsakes, they're nice things.

39:56.477 --> 39:57.937
For me, they're bear traps.

39:59.313 --> 40:01.190
You see, sometimes,
when I'm stressed,

40:01.190 --> 40:04.110
I time travel,
and if I'm thinking
about my mom, and it gets to me,

40:04.110 --> 40:06.237
sometimes I have to go
and watch her die again.

40:08.072 --> 40:09.532
Is that gonna happen now?

40:09.532 --> 40:12.868
- Maybe. I'm trying to hold on.
- Okay, hold on.

40:15.454 --> 40:16.914
I'm not really an asshole.

40:18.290 --> 40:21.961
It's just the opposite of being
an asshole is caring, and...

40:21.961 --> 40:24.880
caring opens a hole at my feet,
and sometimes, I fall in.

40:26.882 --> 40:29.176
And if I make the mistake
of loving someone,

40:29.260 --> 40:31.595
I don't know how many times
I'm gonna have to lose them.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.097
Okay?

40:34.682 --> 40:35.724
Okay.

40:39.061 --> 40:40.104
Okay.

40:42.022 --> 40:43.107
Okay, good.

40:46.152 --> 40:49.405
Every night my mom performed,
she would, um...

40:49.405 --> 40:51.490
she'd talk to the audience,
you know?

40:51.574 --> 40:52.908
Q and A, that kind of thing.

40:54.326 --> 40:56.328
I wasn't there that night.

40:56.412 --> 41:00.207
And I've never heard
this tape before,
so maybe there's an opportunity.

41:01.208 --> 41:02.334
For what?

41:02.960 --> 41:04.170
For you to meet my mom.

41:06.672 --> 41:08.841
How?

41:08.841 --> 41:11.802
- Well, I have an idea, it might even work.
- CLARE, 20: What might?

41:13.721 --> 41:16.182
<i>You are all too kind,
just very kind.</i>

41:16.182 --> 41:18.392
Listening to her on a tape
isn't meeting her.

41:18.392 --> 41:20.269
<i>This has been
an amazing evening...</i>

41:20.269 --> 41:23.772
It's sweet,
but it's not the same.

41:26.901 --> 41:28.360
So, what would you ask her...

41:29.612 --> 41:31.238
if you could?

41:31.322 --> 41:34.325
- Oh, I can't ask her anything.
- HENRY, 28: Yeah, but if you could, what would it be?

41:34.325 --> 41:36.785
- I don't wanna play games.
- HENRY, 28: I'm not playing games,

41:36.869 --> 41:39.914
Clare, I'm trying to introduce
you to my mom. Please.

41:44.001 --> 41:45.044
I don't know.

41:45.961 --> 41:47.004
Um...

41:48.839 --> 41:50.466
I guess, uh...

41:52.676 --> 41:53.802
I don't know.

41:55.679 --> 41:58.849
How do people ever get together?

41:58.933 --> 42:01.602
You know? I mean,
how does that even happen?

42:03.896 --> 42:06.357
<i>I have a lot of people
to thank. But before I do,</i>

42:06.357 --> 42:08.943
<i>if you'll excuse me,
I just need to pass on a message</i>

42:08.943 --> 42:11.654
<i>to somebody who I know
is gonna be listening tonight.</i>

42:13.322 --> 42:15.908
<i>Hello, Clare.</i>

42:15.908 --> 42:17.451
<i>I'm talking
to Clare Abshire,</i>

42:17.451 --> 42:19.495
<i>who's either here tonight
or listening in.</i>

42:21.121 --> 42:24.250
A gentleman stopped me at
the stage door this afternoon,

42:24.250 --> 42:28.629
<i>and he asked me a question from
Clare, and he asked if I would
answer it tonight, and--</i>

42:28.629 --> 42:31.340
<i>and he was very sweet,
and very kind, and insistent.</i>

42:31.340 --> 42:33.634
<i>And, I guess,
I kind of liked him, so...</i>

42:35.052 --> 42:37.388
<i>I'm gonna try and answer
Clare's question tonight.</i>

42:39.056 --> 42:40.391
How is this possible?

42:42.393 --> 42:44.853
<i>And her question was this.</i>

42:44.937 --> 42:47.856
<i>How the hell does
any couple ever get together?</i>

42:47.940 --> 42:49.858
How did she hear me?

42:49.942 --> 42:51.318
No, she didn't hear you.

42:53.070 --> 42:54.196
But I can hear you.

42:55.531 --> 42:59.201
And I just decided that whenever
I get to speak to my mom next,

42:59.285 --> 43:02.413
whenever that is,
at the right moment,
that I'll pass your question on.

43:03.872 --> 43:06.792
And on the night this recording
was made, she'll answer it.

43:08.627 --> 43:11.505
So, the answer
to the question that
you only just thought of asking

43:11.505 --> 43:13.048
has been on this tape since...

43:13.882 --> 43:15.301
before you were born.

43:21.056 --> 43:22.141
You wanna hear it?

43:25.352 --> 43:26.478
My mom's answer?

43:29.857 --> 43:33.527
<i>I mean, I guess, we've all wondered that one.</i>

43:33.527 --> 43:35.321
I...

43:36.572 --> 43:38.449
I don't know why he asked me.

43:38.449 --> 43:40.242
I'm a singer. I just sing.

43:40.326 --> 43:44.204
But I have just been singing
"Madame Butterfly,"
which is all about doomed love,

43:44.288 --> 43:46.707
and I guess
that got me thinking this.

43:50.210 --> 43:51.628
Isn't all love doomed?

43:53.297 --> 43:55.049
<i>I don't mean
to be a party pooper.</i>

43:55.049 --> 43:57.718
<i>You know...</i>

43:57.718 --> 44:00.220
<i>but it always ends,
doesn't it?</i>

44:02.473 --> 44:04.183
<i>So, Clare...</i>

44:04.183 --> 44:06.268
<i>if you're listening,
and you're worried...</i>

44:07.102 --> 44:09.521
my answer,
and Puccini's, is this.

44:12.441 --> 44:13.817
<i>Couples don't get together.</i>

44:16.278 --> 44:19.656
What they do, is they get
together for a while.

44:20.616 --> 44:23.202
It's just a while,
just a little time.

44:25.329 --> 44:26.372
That's okay.

44:28.374 --> 44:31.960
<i>Because it is better
to be happy for a little while,</i>

44:32.044 --> 44:35.172
<i>just a brief time,
even if you know
you're going to lose it,</i>

44:35.172 --> 44:38.550
<i>than to be just "okay"
for your whole life.</i>

44:41.804 --> 44:44.640
<i>And for what it's worth,
my advice is this.</i>

44:46.350 --> 44:48.060
<i>It's always later
than you think,</i>

44:48.060 --> 44:51.021
<i>and this is the only time
you ever get.</i>

44:54.566 --> 44:56.068
So, good luck, Clare.

44:57.820 --> 44:59.279
<i>And you know what?</i>

45:00.823 --> 45:05.994
Just get the hell on with it!
