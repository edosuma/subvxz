00:13.531 --> 00:16.800
Livy, it could take weeks
to find Ethan's replacement.

00:16.867 --> 00:18.968
In the meantime, I'm going

00:19.036 --> 00:20.870
to need a provisional
chief of staff.

00:20.938 --> 00:22.739
I would like that to be you.

00:22.807 --> 00:24.674
<i>I have Larry Moss
calling for you.</i>

00:24.742 --> 00:27.744
<i>Ma'am, we have evidence
Juma allowed Starkwood to use</i>

00:27.812 --> 00:30.179
Sangala as a base to manufacture
biological weapons.

00:30.247 --> 00:31.981
Are you saying these
weapons are on US soil?

00:32.049 --> 00:33.115
We suspect they're at the
Starkwood headquarters

00:33.183 --> 00:34.317
in Virginia.

00:34.384 --> 00:36.218
And you're not suggesting
that Starkwood intends

00:36.286 --> 00:38.187
to use those weapons
to attack this country?

00:38.255 --> 00:39.355
Given their actions today,

00:39.423 --> 00:41.424
we need to move
on Starkwood immediately.

00:41.492 --> 00:42.826
They're coming

00:42.893 --> 00:45.094
and they'll be coming with
everything they've got

00:45.162 --> 00:47.931
and the only thing
that's going to stop them

00:47.998 --> 00:50.066
is getting these weapons
ready to deploy.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.669
Tell me what
the FBI knows.

00:52.736 --> 00:53.870
I don't know anything,

00:53.938 --> 00:56.038
Mr. Hodges.

00:56.106 --> 00:57.941
<i>Get him out of here</i>

00:58.008 --> 00:59.175
and do what you have to do.

01:00.978 --> 01:02.846
I'm not spending
the rest of my life

01:02.913 --> 01:05.348
in prison because Jonas
Hodges has lost his mind.

01:05.415 --> 01:07.116
You know where the weapons are?
Yes.

01:07.184 --> 01:08.918
Where's Jack?

01:08.986 --> 01:10.854
<i>He managed to secure
the weapons,</i>

01:10.921 --> 01:12.589
but Starkwood got him back.

01:12.656 --> 01:14.223
Jack was exposed.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.692
There has to be something that

01:15.759 --> 01:17.727
you can do to help him.
There's no cure.

01:17.795 --> 01:18.995
We got a location
on the weapon.

01:21.532 --> 01:22.665
nt to go.

01:22.733 --> 01:25.135
I'm sorry.
I can't allow it.

01:25.203 --> 01:26.336
I'm the only one who's
seen the canisters.

01:26.403 --> 01:27.904
I know exactly what
we're looking for.

01:27.972 --> 01:29.672
But you're sick.
We have no idea

01:29.740 --> 01:31.141
when you're going to
start showing symptoms.

01:31.209 --> 01:32.209
You're right.

01:38.149 --> 01:39.182
Where are the damn weapons?!

01:40.818 --> 01:42.085
He played me.

01:42.153 --> 01:43.353
<i>Little old Seaton</i>

01:43.420 --> 01:44.587
bought us some time.

01:44.655 --> 01:46.289
We're going to do
a point by point search

01:46.357 --> 01:47.757
of this entire compound.

01:53.430 --> 01:55.765
There are biological weapons
on this facility.

01:55.833 --> 01:56.833
We're not going
anywhere without them.

01:56.901 --> 01:58.701
<i>You try to advance any farther,</i>

01:58.769 --> 01:59.870
you will be fired upon.

02:12.816 --> 02:15.285
I count three
platoons at least.

02:15.353 --> 02:16.753
Everything mil-spec.

02:16.820 --> 02:18.621
Yeah. They were
waiting for us.

02:18.689 --> 02:21.591
This was one big trap.

02:21.658 --> 02:23.927
Renee, we would really use
those satellite overheads.

02:23.995 --> 02:25.195
Copy, Larry.

02:25.263 --> 02:26.963
What have we got?
Nothing.

02:27.031 --> 02:28.131
The subnet's been crashing.

02:28.199 --> 02:29.632
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Here we go.

02:29.700 --> 02:31.734
I've got sat five
retasking now...

02:31.802 --> 02:33.103
Somebody talk to me.

02:33.170 --> 02:34.371
What are you seeing?

02:34.438 --> 02:36.039
Larry, you've got
hostiles on all sides.

02:36.107 --> 02:37.840
Damn it. Find
me an opening.

02:37.909 --> 02:39.109
I'm looking,

02:39.176 --> 02:40.877
but there's no way through.
Okay, heads up.

02:40.945 --> 02:42.478
<i>Is everybody seeing this?</i>

02:42.546 --> 02:43.679
<i>Larry?</i>

02:43.747 --> 02:45.882
Yeah.

02:45.950 --> 02:47.150
Yeah. we're seeing it.

02:58.729 --> 03:01.164
It's Hodges.

03:01.232 --> 03:05.035
The men are
at the ready, sir.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.436
I appreciate
your presence.

03:06.503 --> 03:08.271
Where else would I be?

03:09.807 --> 03:10.907
Who's in charge here?

03:10.975 --> 03:12.775
I am.

03:12.843 --> 03:14.144
Agent Moss.

03:14.211 --> 03:17.180
You need to move your men
and allow us to proceed.

03:17.248 --> 03:18.949
I want you
off our property

03:19.016 --> 03:21.184
and I want you
to release my man.

03:21.252 --> 03:23.153
You have no right
to take him hostage.

03:23.220 --> 03:26.022
I have an order from the
President of the United States.

03:26.090 --> 03:28.524
To search this building.

03:28.592 --> 03:32.329
<i>For weapons that do not exist.</i>

03:32.396 --> 03:34.630
Have you looked?

03:34.698 --> 03:36.632
Are there weapons
of mass destruction?

03:36.700 --> 03:38.468
Are there weapons of any kind?

03:40.438 --> 03:42.705
Is there anything
in here at all?!

03:47.911 --> 03:49.679
Agent Moss,

03:49.746 --> 03:52.815
who dreamed up this charade?

03:52.883 --> 03:54.884
Give me a name.

03:54.952 --> 03:56.186
Let's get to the bottom of this.

03:56.253 --> 03:59.755
You want to talk
to me, Mr. Hodges?

03:59.823 --> 04:01.891
Get these guns off my head.

04:01.959 --> 04:04.827
You think you have
a gun at your head?

04:04.895 --> 04:06.296
You know what I've got?

04:06.364 --> 04:09.099
I've got the United States
government sending SWAT teams

04:09.166 --> 04:11.301
and attack helicopters
in the middle of the night.

04:11.369 --> 04:16.172
I've got a government that
I served faithfully for 30 years

04:16.240 --> 04:18.641
dreaming up BS accusations

04:18.709 --> 04:22.112
so politicians too cowardly
to show their faces

04:22.179 --> 04:24.347
can dismantle my company.

04:24.415 --> 04:25.781
That's what I've got.

04:30.621 --> 04:31.921
You've got five minutes

04:31.989 --> 04:34.924
to get these-these helicopters
flying out of here

04:34.992 --> 04:37.093
with all of you on board.

04:37.161 --> 04:38.495
You don't want
to do this.

04:38.562 --> 04:41.197
Five minutes.

04:41.265 --> 04:42.598
And I want my man back.

04:50.941 --> 04:52.275
Renee, you get that?

04:52.343 --> 04:53.376
Yeah, we did.

04:53.444 --> 04:55.412
And what options do we have?
In five minutes?

04:55.479 --> 04:57.247
I know there's no time
to bring in more TAC support,

04:57.314 --> 04:58.548
so give me something else.

05:00.051 --> 05:02.685
All right, Larry, give me
a second. Stand by.

05:02.753 --> 05:04.754
That's it.

05:06.757 --> 05:08.291
I want to show
you something.

05:08.359 --> 05:09.792
Hodges just gave us five
minutes to clear the base.

05:09.860 --> 05:11.061
We lost that situation.
We were outmaneuvered

05:11.128 --> 05:13.063
but I think I found
us a new way in.

05:13.130 --> 05:14.964
Look. These are
Senator Mayer's files.

05:15.032 --> 05:17.033
This is Douglas Knowles.
He's the chairman of Starkwood.

05:17.101 --> 05:18.768
He was actually helping

05:18.835 --> 05:20.136
the senator with
the investigation.

05:20.204 --> 05:21.504
He is the one who
brokered the deal

05:21.572 --> 05:22.872
to open the company's books.

05:22.940 --> 05:24.474
What, another insider?
Didn't we just get burned?

05:24.542 --> 05:25.708
Just listen.

05:25.776 --> 05:27.810
Knowles was loyal to
Hodges for almost 20 years

05:27.878 --> 05:30.413
and now he's secretly helping
the senator take down Starkwood?

05:30.481 --> 05:31.548
He's scared of something.

05:31.615 --> 05:33.483
This man wants to help us.

05:33.551 --> 05:34.951
It's worth a shot.

05:35.018 --> 05:36.819
Yeah. Make the call.

05:44.495 --> 05:45.928
Knowles.

05:45.996 --> 05:47.730
Mr. Knowles,
my name is Jack Bauer.

05:47.798 --> 05:49.499
I got your number
from Senator Mayer.

05:49.567 --> 05:51.000
Senator Mayer is dead.

05:51.068 --> 05:52.969
Yes, sir, I know. I was
with him when he was killed

05:53.036 --> 05:54.003
by one of your employees.

05:54.071 --> 05:57.039
A man named John Quinn.

05:59.410 --> 06:02.112
You have no idea how much
I was hoping someone would call.

06:02.179 --> 06:04.247
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't understand.

06:04.315 --> 06:06.416
Things are very
out of control.

06:06.484 --> 06:07.850
Are you aware
of what's happening

06:07.918 --> 06:08.951
on your base?

06:09.019 --> 06:10.987
I'm watching it
with my own eyes.

06:11.054 --> 06:12.255
The FBI is pinned down.

06:12.323 --> 06:13.956
They say they're looking
for bioweapons.

06:14.024 --> 06:15.825
Sir, Jonas Hodges
is in possession

06:15.892 --> 06:17.760
of a military-grade
bioweapon.

06:17.828 --> 06:20.330
A prion variant developed
in Africa with General Juma.

06:20.397 --> 06:22.432
Well, it's not
where they think it is.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.800
They're all standing in
front of an empty hangar.

06:24.868 --> 06:26.869
The FBI was deliberately led
to the wrong location

06:26.937 --> 06:28.704
by a man named Seaton,
but I promise you, sir,

06:28.772 --> 06:30.173
the weapon is
on your base.

06:30.241 --> 06:32.875
I was contaminated when trying
to intercept the canisters.

06:32.943 --> 06:33.943
They were ferried
back to Starkwood

06:34.011 --> 06:35.478
approximately 90
minutes ago.

06:35.546 --> 06:37.680
90 minutes ago
Jonas was handing down

06:37.748 --> 06:39.349
his new strategy to the board.

06:39.416 --> 06:42.952
Stonewall the government,
no cooperation whatsoever.

06:43.020 --> 06:44.987
I can't believe
this is happening.

06:45.055 --> 06:46.623
Sir, this is happening

06:46.690 --> 06:48.491
and I promise you
the weapons are on your base.

06:48.559 --> 06:50.627
Do you have any idea
where they might be?

06:50.694 --> 06:52.895
I think I might.

06:52.963 --> 06:54.764
Mr. Knowles, I want
to put you in touch

06:54.831 --> 06:55.798
with one of my men
in the field.

06:55.866 --> 06:57.667
Can I call you right back?
Yes.

06:57.734 --> 07:00.069
Thank you. Go.

07:00.137 --> 07:03.473
<i>Some of the men were unhappy
drawing down on federal agents.</i>

07:03.541 --> 07:05.542
It's understandable.

07:05.609 --> 07:08.578
I had hoped not
to include the rank and file.

07:08.646 --> 07:10.713
You can count on them.

07:10.781 --> 07:13.949
Let's show our guests the door.

07:16.287 --> 07:17.487
Let's move!

07:17.555 --> 07:20.290
Into position.

07:27.097 --> 07:29.031
Jack, I'm on comm.

07:29.099 --> 07:31.267
You're on with me
and Agent Walker.

07:31.335 --> 07:32.502
Hodges' men have
repositioned themselves.

07:32.570 --> 07:34.337
Okay, we're going
to have to move fast.

07:34.405 --> 07:35.538
Larry, I want
you and your men

07:35.606 --> 07:37.006
to pull out on
Hodges' timetable.

07:37.074 --> 07:38.774
Tony, you're going to need
to find a way to stay behind.

07:38.842 --> 07:40.910
We're going to get your vectors
over to a man that we contacted

07:40.977 --> 07:42.078
inside Starkwood.

07:42.145 --> 07:43.246
His name is Douglas Knowles.

07:43.314 --> 07:44.780
He believes he knows
where the weapons are.

07:44.848 --> 07:46.849
Isn't this how we got
into this mess?

07:46.917 --> 07:48.918
Almeida and some supposedly
friendly contact?

07:48.985 --> 07:50.019
Knowles is chairman

07:50.087 --> 07:51.421
of the Starkwood board,
but he was cooperating

07:51.488 --> 07:53.189
with Senator Mayer's
investigation of the company.

07:53.257 --> 07:54.591
Larry, he is all that we've got.

07:54.658 --> 07:58.928
All right, I got 400 eyeballs
trained on me right now.

07:58.995 --> 08:01.130
How the hell are we supposed
to get Almeida to stay behind?

08:01.198 --> 08:02.932
Larry, I need you and your
men to create a diversion

08:02.999 --> 08:03.966
to cover Tony's escape.

08:04.034 --> 08:05.968
Look, we need to
make this work.

08:06.036 --> 08:07.437
If you all get on those
helicopters together,

08:07.504 --> 08:09.472
we are going to lose
this weapon for good.

08:12.809 --> 08:15.945
<i>Larry, are you
on board with this?</i>

08:17.548 --> 08:19.315
We got to go.

08:19.383 --> 08:21.284
Larry, we need to know,
are you on board?

08:21.352 --> 08:24.019
I'll do what I can.

08:26.123 --> 08:27.423
Take his bag.

08:27.491 --> 08:29.492
All right, let's go.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.661
We're standing down.
You're coming with me.

08:31.729 --> 08:33.095
Hey, wait a minute.

08:33.163 --> 08:34.496
This wasn't part
of the deal.

08:34.565 --> 08:36.164
What deal? As far as I could
tell, he couldn't care about you

08:36.232 --> 08:38.100
one way or the other.
Moss.

08:38.168 --> 08:39.934
You take these handcuffs
off of me

08:40.003 --> 08:41.203
or it's going
to get really ugly.

08:46.176 --> 08:47.377
Soldier!

08:52.015 --> 08:53.816
Get the hell out
of here, Moss.

08:53.884 --> 08:55.885
You don't want
to test us.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.788
Let's go!

09:39.029 --> 09:40.296
Don't move. No!

09:40.364 --> 09:41.564
Doug Knowles.

09:41.632 --> 09:44.567
Jack Bauer sent me.
Come on.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.310
That street's
solid security cameras.

09:54.378 --> 09:56.512
I'll take you to
a restricted area.

09:56.580 --> 09:57.913
It's on the
east perimeter.

09:57.981 --> 09:59.816
There's a good chance
the weapons are there.

09:59.883 --> 10:01.851
The place is crawling.

10:01.918 --> 10:03.353
I don't know how
we're going to make it.

10:03.420 --> 10:05.020
I'll take care of that.

10:05.088 --> 10:07.323
<i>Jack, I'm with Knowles.</i>

10:07.391 --> 10:10.526
I'm going to need satellite
support on the east perimeter.

10:13.096 --> 10:14.731
Jack, I need support.
Do you copy?

10:16.933 --> 10:19.301
Copy, Tony.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.772
I've got you just
off the landing pad.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.407
No hostiles
in your immediate vicinity.

10:24.475 --> 10:25.575
Proceed at your own discretion.

10:25.642 --> 10:26.576
Copy that.

10:26.643 --> 10:28.544
Which way?

10:28.612 --> 10:30.413
Come on.

10:32.416 --> 10:33.449
Jack.

10:34.518 --> 10:36.218
You all right?

10:36.286 --> 10:38.287
Yeah, I'm fine.

10:39.690 --> 10:40.923
Tony and Knowles have connected.
We're good.

10:40.991 --> 10:42.492
It's time to call
the White House with an update.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.560
Okay, good.
I'll be right there.

11:02.712 --> 11:05.013
Madam President,
excuse the interruption.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.448
Jack Bauer is on line seven.

11:08.985 --> 11:12.520
Mr. Bauer, tell me you
have the bioweapon.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.656
Madam President,
I'm afraid that's not the case.

11:14.724 --> 11:16.224
Our search was stopped
by armed mercenaries

11:16.292 --> 11:17.726
on Starkwood's base.

11:17.794 --> 11:19.227
Agent Moss and his men
were forced to withdraw

11:19.295 --> 11:21.663
from a firefight they most
certainly would have lost.

11:21.731 --> 11:23.398
Are you saying Hodges
men were ready to fire

11:23.466 --> 11:25.033
on federal agents?

11:25.101 --> 11:26.568
Yes, ma'am, that's correct.

11:26.636 --> 11:27.603
My God!

11:27.670 --> 11:28.937
Who does he think he is?!

11:30.272 --> 11:32.340
Madam President,
despite the setback,

11:32.408 --> 11:34.042
I am confident
the weapons are still there.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.711
I reached out to
Starkwood's chairman.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.146
He's willing to cooperate.
He's with Tony Alameida now.

11:38.214 --> 11:40.248
They are moving towards
a secure area on the base

11:40.316 --> 11:41.883
where we believe the
weapons are being held.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.051
Very good.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.219
Tim, what's our
troop status?

11:44.286 --> 11:45.253
Mobilizing.

11:45.321 --> 11:46.387
The Secretary
of Defense says

11:46.455 --> 11:47.623
they're still several hours out.

11:47.690 --> 11:49.290
At which point we have
a war on our hands

11:49.358 --> 11:50.726
against 1,500
mercenaries

11:50.793 --> 11:52.393
armed with bioweapons.

11:52.461 --> 11:54.062
Madam President, I do believe
that a surgical air strike

11:54.130 --> 11:55.530
will work as long
as we can pinpoint

11:55.598 --> 11:57.766
the exact location
of the weapon.

11:57.834 --> 11:58.834
And you can do that?

11:58.901 --> 12:00.201
Yes, I believe we can.

12:00.269 --> 12:02.170
Mr. Bauer,
you've seen the canisters

12:02.238 --> 12:03.404
containing the bioweapons,
you know what

12:03.472 --> 12:04.706
they look like,
is that correct?

12:04.774 --> 12:05.874
Yes, ma'am.

12:05.942 --> 12:08.276
Then we'll need you
to verify the canisters

12:08.344 --> 12:10.411
once Almeida
has located them.

12:10.479 --> 12:11.980
No more mistakes.

12:12.048 --> 12:13.214
<i>We're gonna need
visual confirmation</i>

12:13.282 --> 12:14.950
from you, Bauer-- eyes on.

12:15.018 --> 12:17.953
Jack, we have got
to get this part right.

12:18.021 --> 12:19.587
I understand.
Anything else?

12:23.126 --> 12:25.827
Jack, I have been told
that you were exposed

12:25.895 --> 12:27.529
to the pathogen.

12:27.596 --> 12:29.131
How you doing?

12:30.399 --> 12:31.566
Right now I'm fine,
Madam President.

12:31.634 --> 12:33.035
Thank you for asking.

12:33.102 --> 12:35.137
Thank you for your service.

12:35.204 --> 12:37.005
I'm not giving up on you.

12:37.073 --> 12:38.606
Keep me informed.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.075
Yes, ma'am.

12:40.143 --> 12:42.144
Let's go.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.254
I don't have a lot of time.

12:53.322 --> 12:54.389
What's going on?

12:54.456 --> 12:55.557
That's what I've been
trying to ask you.

12:55.624 --> 12:56.624
I called three times.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.293
It's kind of crazy
here right now.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.761
Unless it's urgent,
I gotta call you back.

12:59.829 --> 13:01.629
I'm hearing rumors
that the Joint Chiefs

13:01.698 --> 13:02.864
have been called in.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.266
It's not a big deal.

13:05.334 --> 13:06.634
They're just doing
a final assessment

13:06.703 --> 13:07.936
before lowering the alert level.

13:08.004 --> 13:09.304
Olivia, don't do this.

13:09.371 --> 13:10.638
What?

13:10.707 --> 13:11.973
I'm telling you the truth.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.709
Really?

13:13.776 --> 13:15.510
Because I've got a source
in the Port Authority

13:15.578 --> 13:17.679
container yard who's
using terms like "weapons

13:17.747 --> 13:19.614
of mass destruction,"
so naturally I'm wondering

13:19.682 --> 13:22.383
if that's why the Joint Chiefs
are having a meeting.

13:22.451 --> 13:24.853
Look, I can't
talk about it.

13:24.921 --> 13:27.022
It's obviously a question
of national security.

13:27.090 --> 13:29.157
But you have my word
I'll tell you soon as I can.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.592
I want to know now.

13:32.494 --> 13:35.097
I just gave you
a big story, Ken.

13:35.164 --> 13:37.032
You'll have to wait.
I gotta go.

13:37.100 --> 13:39.667
Don't hang up on me, Olivia.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.837
That'd be a big mistake.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.539
What's that supposed to mean?

13:44.607 --> 13:47.475
You want me to say it,
fine, I'll say it.

13:47.543 --> 13:49.644
Think how your mother
would feel when she hears

13:49.712 --> 13:51.179
that you forced out
her chief of staff

13:51.247 --> 13:52.513
so you could take
over his position.

13:55.017 --> 13:56.684
He was incompetent.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.254
Yeah, well, it won't play
that way on the morning news.

13:59.321 --> 14:01.289
So, talk to me.

14:01.357 --> 14:03.225
Now.

14:05.628 --> 14:06.828
I can't talk here.

14:06.896 --> 14:09.597
I'm in the Roosevelt
Continental, room 1271.

14:09.665 --> 14:11.867
You've got half an hour.

14:20.143 --> 14:22.010
Agent Pierce,
please get a car ready.

14:22.078 --> 14:23.745
I have to make a quick run.

14:30.586 --> 14:32.187
All right, Jack, we're here.

14:32.255 --> 14:33.688
Knowles says there's
been increased activity

14:33.756 --> 14:35.123
in this area
for several days now.

14:35.191 --> 14:36.758
I'm looking at about
a half a dozen buildings.

14:36.826 --> 14:38.193
Could be any one of them.

14:38.261 --> 14:39.294
Copy that, Tony.

14:39.361 --> 14:40.896
Hold on, we're getting
infrared up now.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.932
I'm counting seven buildings
in your immediate vicinity.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.868
The building directly
southeast of your current

14:46.936 --> 14:50.505
position is showing
no infrared signal.

14:50.572 --> 14:52.573
I'm guessing they're using
a blackout shield.

14:52.641 --> 14:53.875
All right,
we'll try there first.

14:53.943 --> 14:55.777
You see any patrols
coming our way?

14:55.845 --> 14:57.578
Negative, you're clear.

14:57.646 --> 14:59.514
Okay, let's go.

15:15.431 --> 15:16.798
Jack, Knowles'
key card isn't working.

15:16.866 --> 15:18.867
We're gonna need
electronic support here.

15:18.935 --> 15:20.568
There should be an
R-6 interface module

15:20.636 --> 15:22.070
on the back of your comm device.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.171
It's a card key.

15:23.239 --> 15:24.873
Yeah, I know what
that is, thank you.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.844
I'm plugging in now.

15:31.247 --> 15:32.914
Okay, we're up.

15:32.982 --> 15:34.349
Cormac Z series.

15:34.416 --> 15:36.184
We're looking
at a five digit key

15:36.252 --> 15:38.920
protected by an AES
block cipher.

15:38.988 --> 15:41.756
Running combinations.

15:41.824 --> 15:44.259
Okay, Tony, you've got
a vehicle coming your way.

15:44.327 --> 15:46.494
It's east of you
about a hundred yards.

15:46.562 --> 15:48.596
Take cover down there.

15:50.833 --> 15:52.167
How much longer?

15:52.235 --> 15:53.235
How much more time do you need?

15:54.503 --> 15:55.837
I only have two
out of five digits.

15:55.905 --> 15:58.073
We're pretty exposed here.

15:59.108 --> 16:00.775
Jack?

16:00.843 --> 16:01.877
It's all right, I'm fine.

16:04.013 --> 16:05.513
Come on.

16:18.861 --> 16:19.928
<i>Two more numbers, Tony.</i>

16:23.565 --> 16:24.632
What are we gonna do?

16:24.700 --> 16:26.534
We still got two digits to go.

16:26.602 --> 16:28.904
Move in for a closer look.

16:30.739 --> 16:31.706
Sit tight.

16:31.774 --> 16:34.075
Doug, where you-- Doug!

16:44.753 --> 16:46.721
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:49.058 --> 16:50.225
Hold your position.

16:50.293 --> 16:52.294
May I see some ID?

16:53.329 --> 16:54.562
Doug Knowles.

16:59.802 --> 17:01.036
<i>One to go.</i>

17:04.006 --> 17:06.441
I apologize, Mr. Knowles.

17:06.508 --> 17:08.009
Mr. Hodges has ordered the base

17:08.077 --> 17:09.844
cleared of all
nonessential personnel.

17:09.912 --> 17:12.012
Nonessential personnel?

17:12.080 --> 17:14.049
I'm chairman of the board.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.583
I realize that,
but we're dealing

17:15.651 --> 17:17.117
with a heightened
security situation here.

17:17.185 --> 17:18.586
So, I need to know
what you were doing

17:18.654 --> 17:19.787
in this area.

17:19.855 --> 17:21.189
<i>Jonas called a late night</i>

17:21.257 --> 17:23.891
board meeting,
that's what I'm doing here.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.228
Sir, that meeting
ended nearly

17:27.296 --> 17:29.464
- two hours ago.
- <i>We got it; we're in.</i>

17:29.531 --> 17:32.033
I don't have to explain
myself to you, you know.

17:32.101 --> 17:35.136
I'm sorry, sir,
but you do.

17:35.204 --> 17:36.537
Sir, I don't believe
you're hearing me.

17:36.605 --> 17:39.407
No, I don't you're hearing me!

17:39.475 --> 17:41.242
Look, I built this company!

17:41.310 --> 17:43.178
And I don't need you
telling me

17:43.245 --> 17:45.313
where I can
and cannot walk!

17:45.381 --> 17:46.982
Understood?!

17:47.049 --> 17:48.749
<i>You're gonna have
to come with me, sir.</i>

17:48.817 --> 17:50.452
Right this way.

17:54.823 --> 17:56.157
I'm in.

17:56.225 --> 17:57.459
But they got Knowles.

17:57.526 --> 17:58.893
Do you think he's
gonna say anything?

17:58.961 --> 18:00.061
I don't know.

18:00.129 --> 18:01.696
But I better get in and out

18:01.763 --> 18:03.564
as fast as possible
just in case he does.

18:03.632 --> 18:05.433
Okay, Tony, the president
needs a visual

18:05.501 --> 18:06.868
on the weapons before
she'll launch an attack.

18:06.935 --> 18:08.069
She needs your eyes

18:08.137 --> 18:09.837
on the canisters and a
confirmation by Jack.

18:09.905 --> 18:12.607
Copy that.

18:12.674 --> 18:14.409
I'm moving.

18:14.477 --> 18:15.477
Good.

18:16.845 --> 18:17.845
Jack?

18:17.913 --> 18:20.848
Stay here, I'll be right back.

18:23.252 --> 18:25.920
Jack! Jack?!

18:25.988 --> 18:27.788
We need a medic! Jack!

18:27.856 --> 18:29.290
Jack?!

18:29.358 --> 18:31.192
Jack?

18:31.260 --> 18:32.660
Get me the medic!

18:45.563 --> 18:47.196
We just found
Mr. Knowles alone

18:47.265 --> 18:50.166
just outside
the restricted zone.

18:50.234 --> 18:52.001
Did he have an explanation?

18:52.069 --> 18:54.103
Yes, sir,
he said he was walking.

18:54.171 --> 18:56.439
Walking.

18:56.507 --> 18:59.008
Should I take him to Stokes
for interrogation, sir?

18:59.076 --> 19:03.079
You're suggesting what, soldier,
that we strap him down,

19:03.147 --> 19:05.114
extract a confession,
because he was walking?

19:05.182 --> 19:07.284
He's the chairman of the board.

19:07.351 --> 19:09.519
I was just requesting

19:09.587 --> 19:10.853
instructions, sir.

19:10.921 --> 19:12.455
What you'd like done.

19:12.523 --> 19:14.791
I'd like you to take him
to his office.

19:14.858 --> 19:16.293
Make sure he's comfortable.

19:16.360 --> 19:18.795
And stay with him
until I arrive.

19:18.862 --> 19:20.263
Yes, sir.

19:20.331 --> 19:21.698
Will that be all?

19:21.766 --> 19:22.932
Call zone nine,

19:23.000 --> 19:24.434
have them double down security.

19:24.502 --> 19:27.337
Let's make sure that
Mr. Knowles was in fact alone.

19:27.405 --> 19:28.405
Yes, sir.

19:41.084 --> 19:43.119
How much longer?

19:43.187 --> 19:44.621
Half an hour.

19:44.689 --> 19:47.056
Good.

19:47.124 --> 19:49.826
I'll need to know
the minute it's done.

19:49.893 --> 19:51.227
Yes, sir.

19:57.468 --> 20:00.437
Aaron, I'd like you to wait
in the hall, if that's okay.

20:00.504 --> 20:04.040
Ms. Taylor, you tasked me
with handling your security.

20:04.107 --> 20:06.209
I can't allow you
to enter a hotel room

20:06.276 --> 20:08.277
I haven't vetted.

20:10.314 --> 20:12.915
Aaron, I appreciate the concern.

20:12.983 --> 20:16.018
But you can see
the door from here,

20:16.086 --> 20:17.887
I have you on speed-dial,

20:17.955 --> 20:20.923
and I can scream very loudly
when the occasion demands.

20:20.991 --> 20:24.093
I just need two minutes
to wrangle a reporter.

20:24.161 --> 20:26.396
Really, I'll be fine.

20:26.464 --> 20:28.931
All right, I'll be here
if you need me.

20:47.985 --> 20:50.219
Want a drink?
No.

20:51.622 --> 20:53.189
I assume you don't mind if I do.

20:53.257 --> 20:55.492
It's been a day.

20:57.895 --> 20:59.962
I gotta tell you.

21:00.030 --> 21:01.564
I don't like being threatened.

21:01.632 --> 21:02.899
It was unfortunate.

21:02.966 --> 21:04.200
I apologize.

21:04.268 --> 21:06.436
We've known each other
a long time, Ken.

21:06.504 --> 21:08.004
I thought we had
an understanding.

21:08.071 --> 21:09.472
We do.

21:09.540 --> 21:11.941
And I want to keep it that way.

21:13.176 --> 21:15.244
We both do.
Am I right?

21:17.548 --> 21:20.884
Okay, so, I told you,
I have this source.

21:20.951 --> 21:23.386
Cop out at the Port
Authority container yard.

21:23.454 --> 21:24.721
Okay.

21:24.789 --> 21:27.256
He told me he saw these
professional assassin types

21:27.324 --> 21:29.592
get into an intense firefight
out there a couple hours ago.

21:29.660 --> 21:30.993
According to him,

21:31.061 --> 21:33.663
someone hijacked a WMD
out to God knows where.

21:35.365 --> 21:36.466
That's true.

21:36.534 --> 21:37.934
Yeah.

21:38.001 --> 21:39.502
Yeah, I want to know
all about it.

21:43.641 --> 21:47.076
Look, if you think all you've
got to do is nod your head

21:47.144 --> 21:49.412
confirming what I already know,
then we've got a problem.

21:49.480 --> 21:51.781
It's national security, Ken.

21:51.849 --> 21:53.082
I can't tell you.

21:53.150 --> 21:54.984
I'm saying you can.

21:55.052 --> 21:58.154
If this story breaks,
it would create a panic.

21:58.221 --> 22:00.423
People would be hurt.

22:00.491 --> 22:01.691
If you knew what it was,
you'd understand why

22:01.759 --> 22:02.692
it's got to stay a secret.

22:02.760 --> 22:05.361
Right, exactly.
I'd understand.

22:05.429 --> 22:08.531
Have a little
faith, okay?

22:10.801 --> 22:14.504
All right. There is a bioweapon
in the container yard.

22:14.572 --> 22:16.473
That's what
they were fighting over.

22:16.540 --> 22:18.808
It was developed by Starkwood
in Africa.

22:18.876 --> 22:20.944
Starkwood?
Right.

22:21.011 --> 22:23.847
They moved it to their base
about 30 miles from here.

22:27.351 --> 22:28.685
So it's there right now.

22:32.523 --> 22:34.524
So this is what the Joint Chiefs
are discussing,

22:34.592 --> 22:35.925
what to do about that.

22:36.694 --> 22:39.328
Olivia...

22:44.869 --> 22:49.438
The president ordered
an air strike

22:49.507 --> 22:54.577
as soon as the exact location
of the canisters was known.

22:57.481 --> 22:59.549
So you see why you can't run
with this?

22:59.617 --> 23:03.419
Really, Ken,
you can't.

23:03.487 --> 23:04.587
A lot of lives
are at stake.

23:04.655 --> 23:07.089
The entire plan depends
on surprise.

23:07.157 --> 23:08.625
You get that, right?

23:14.498 --> 23:17.066
Maybe you're right.

23:17.134 --> 23:19.235
Maybe I need to
kill this story.

23:19.302 --> 23:22.572
Thank you.

23:22.640 --> 23:27.410
What I mean is maybe somebody
could convince me.

23:31.481 --> 23:32.749
What are you saying?

23:32.816 --> 23:35.051
You know what I'm saying.

23:35.118 --> 23:36.085
You're very beautiful

23:36.153 --> 23:37.219
when you get all
patriotic.

23:37.287 --> 23:38.487
I ever tell
you that?

23:38.556 --> 23:39.589
That's over. We agreed.

23:39.657 --> 23:40.890
You agreed.

23:40.958 --> 23:44.393
Really, I don't want to do this.

23:46.597 --> 23:48.865
Ken...

23:48.933 --> 23:51.668
Then say no.

24:10.621 --> 24:11.754
Here, apply pressure.

24:11.822 --> 24:13.756
You can give yourself
an injection

24:13.824 --> 24:15.758
once every two hours.

24:15.826 --> 24:16.893
More if needed.

24:16.961 --> 24:18.494
You think I'll need more?

24:18.562 --> 24:19.862
In all likelihood, yes.

24:19.930 --> 24:23.165
The onset of symptoms so soon
after exposure suggests

24:23.233 --> 24:25.201
the bio-agent is more virulent
than we thought.

24:26.770 --> 24:29.105
All we're doing here
is just masking the symptoms.

24:29.172 --> 24:30.506
I understand.

24:30.574 --> 24:32.441
There's something you may
want to consider, though.

24:32.509 --> 24:34.343
What's that?

24:34.411 --> 24:36.378
Bryden University
has been funding some studies

24:36.446 --> 24:37.379
on prion diseases.

24:37.447 --> 24:38.881
The work is purely
experimental

24:38.949 --> 24:40.650
at this point,
but it does suggest treatment.

24:40.718 --> 24:41.851
That's good news.

24:41.919 --> 24:43.886
I don't want to get anyone's
hopes up here.

24:43.954 --> 24:46.122
We're talking a slight chance.

24:46.189 --> 24:47.690
A possible treatment
using stem cells

24:47.758 --> 24:48.992
from a genetically
compatible donor.

24:49.059 --> 24:50.693
An immediate family member

24:50.761 --> 24:52.328
would make the best
donor candidate.

24:52.395 --> 24:53.462
I saw your file.

24:53.530 --> 24:55.431
It says you have
a daughter, right?

24:55.499 --> 24:57.366
I don't want my daughter
involved in this.

24:57.434 --> 24:59.736
Jack, if there's
a chance.
Mr. Bauer...

24:59.803 --> 25:01.904
Doctor, thank you
for everything you've done.

25:01.972 --> 25:04.140
Excuse me.
I need to get back to work.

25:08.145 --> 25:10.446
Jack...

25:10.514 --> 25:12.314
This is none
of your business.

25:12.382 --> 25:15.051
It's my business
when you're having
a seizure in the middle

25:15.119 --> 25:16.719
of the FBI.
You heard the doctor.

25:16.787 --> 25:18.087
The medication will
mask the symptoms.

25:18.155 --> 25:19.588
Why won't you even
talk about this?

25:19.657 --> 25:21.624
Talk about what?
The experimental
procedure.

25:21.692 --> 25:23.259
Because there's nothing
to talk about.

25:23.326 --> 25:26.162
She's your daughter, and you're
not even gonna let her know?

25:26.229 --> 25:27.130
That's right.

25:27.197 --> 25:29.331
So you're just
not even gonna try?

25:29.399 --> 25:30.967
Renee, I know you're trying
to help,

25:31.035 --> 25:32.935
but you don't know
what you're talking about here.

25:34.404 --> 25:36.605
My daughter and I,
we don't talk, okay?

25:36.674 --> 25:38.141
So, please,
just let it go.

25:41.344 --> 25:43.612
It should be her choice.

25:43.681 --> 25:45.815
Well, it's not.

25:45.883 --> 25:49.618
I'm the one who's dying.
It's my choice.

25:54.524 --> 25:57.526
No sign of the target yet,
but Tony's working on it.

25:57.594 --> 25:59.128
You look better.

25:59.196 --> 26:00.763
Thanks.

26:02.532 --> 26:03.632
Tony, can you hear me?

26:03.701 --> 26:05.034
Jack, you okay?

26:05.102 --> 26:06.569
Yeah, I'm fine.

26:06.636 --> 26:09.906
Okay, Tony, we're seeing new
activity outside the building.

26:09.973 --> 26:11.473
Two vehicles,
eight hostiles.

26:11.541 --> 26:13.109
Looks like
a security detail.

26:13.177 --> 26:14.610
You think Knowles
gave him up?

26:14.678 --> 26:16.645
Tony, they're moving straight
for your point of entry.

26:22.052 --> 26:23.419
<i>Eight hostiles and closing.</i>

26:23.486 --> 26:24.520
Yeah, I hear them.

26:24.588 --> 26:25.621
You want to regroup?

26:25.689 --> 26:28.557
No, I want
to get this over with.

26:39.703 --> 26:41.537
Right there.

26:48.879 --> 26:50.579
Two three, we're clear.

28:12.945 --> 28:15.080
I haven't seen you here before.

28:15.148 --> 28:18.150
They just sent
eight of us over here, sir.

28:18.217 --> 28:19.817
Why, is something wrong?

28:19.885 --> 28:23.321
No, sir.
Just, you know, precautions.

28:23.389 --> 28:25.757
Right, right.
Can't be paranoid enough.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.068
I'm in the main building.

28:36.135 --> 28:37.602
Copy, we're with you.

28:37.670 --> 28:41.973
Tony, it's Jack.
I've got you at 125 feet MSL,

28:42.041 --> 28:43.975
approximately 40 feet
underground. Is that correct?

28:44.043 --> 28:45.977
That's right.
I'm four floors down.

28:46.045 --> 28:49.681
We've got no information
on any kind of subterranean
floors for that building.

28:49.748 --> 28:51.116
Believe me, they're here.

28:51.184 --> 28:54.786
Epoxy-hardened walls,
poured concrete ceilings.

29:06.165 --> 29:09.701
I have a visual on the weapon.

29:09.768 --> 29:12.404
Sending images
for verification now.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.707
Copy that.

29:27.720 --> 29:29.354
Okay, those are
the canisters.

29:29.422 --> 29:32.257
I'll notify Admiral Smith the
target is located and confirmed.

29:32.325 --> 29:33.858
Tony, those are the canisters.

29:36.262 --> 29:38.530
Jack, it looks like
they're transferring

29:38.598 --> 29:40.865
the pathogens
from the canisters

29:40.933 --> 29:42.234
into some sort of
delivery system.

29:42.301 --> 29:43.568
It's on the move.

29:43.636 --> 29:44.936
Copy that.
It doesn't matter.

29:45.004 --> 29:46.304
Renee's phoning
in the coordinates.

29:46.372 --> 29:48.072
Everything's gonna be dust
in the next ten minutes.

29:48.141 --> 29:49.907
Get out of there now.
Copy that.

29:49.975 --> 29:51.643
Withdrawing.

30:03.055 --> 30:04.689
Okay, men.

30:13.166 --> 30:15.567
You want to explain this, Jonas?

30:15.635 --> 30:18.703
I'm arrested by our
own security force.

30:18.771 --> 30:19.704
Held captive

30:19.772 --> 30:21.339
in my own office
like a prisoner.

30:21.407 --> 30:24.543
They won't allow me
a phone call, even to you,

30:24.610 --> 30:26.978
to find out what
the hell is going on!

30:27.046 --> 30:30.549
Well, that's a lot
of complaints, Doug.

30:30.616 --> 30:32.116
You done?

30:32.185 --> 30:35.086
You were supposed
to be home hours ago.

30:35.154 --> 30:37.255
Why'd they find you
snooping around?

30:37.323 --> 30:39.924
I saw the FBI raid.

30:39.992 --> 30:41.726
They say we have bioweapons.

30:45.164 --> 30:46.798
Which they did not find.

30:46.865 --> 30:48.533
That's not the point.

30:48.601 --> 30:50.402
Is it true?

30:52.071 --> 30:55.106
Remember when I first brought
you out here 20 years ago?

30:55.174 --> 30:56.441
There was nothing here.

30:56.509 --> 30:58.376
Nothing.

30:58.444 --> 31:00.278
And out of the damn mud,

31:00.346 --> 31:02.980
we built this place,

31:03.048 --> 31:06.117
the largest private army in the
hemisphere, maybe the world,

31:06.185 --> 31:09.854
and we pulled America's ass
out of the fire

31:09.922 --> 31:12.290
again and again and again.

31:12.358 --> 31:14.058
Answer the question!

31:14.126 --> 31:17.696
I am.

31:19.064 --> 31:20.932
Every day, we've done things

31:20.999 --> 31:23.501
that the government itself
could not or would not do.

31:23.569 --> 31:25.169
"Get this done,"

31:25.238 --> 31:27.171
that's what they said,
"Here's your mission."

31:27.240 --> 31:28.773
Nobody asked how anything
was gonna be done.

31:28.841 --> 31:31.376
Nobody wanted to know.

31:31.444 --> 31:35.647
All anyone wanted was results,
and we delivered.

31:35.715 --> 31:37.482
No one's questioning that.

31:37.550 --> 31:39.351
No one's questioning that?

31:39.418 --> 31:41.253
You're not insane, are you?

31:41.320 --> 31:44.522
The senate, the committees,
the president.

31:44.590 --> 31:47.425
Every chattering nonentity
in Washington

31:47.493 --> 31:49.761
is out there with their standard
operating procedures

31:49.828 --> 31:51.929
saying,
"How was this done?

31:51.997 --> 31:53.365
How was that done?"

31:53.432 --> 31:57.335
Tearing at us, trying to bring
us down, every one of them.

31:57.403 --> 32:01.606
I kept this country strong.
I kept it safe.

32:01.674 --> 32:05.109
And I will not be persecuted
for that.

32:05.177 --> 32:09.414
Jonas, you cannot start
a war against the people

32:09.482 --> 32:11.015
you're supposed to protect.

32:11.083 --> 32:14.085
We were at war, Doug,

32:14.153 --> 32:16.655
the moment they decided
to dismantle us.

32:16.722 --> 32:19.391
And as for particular
weapons,

32:19.458 --> 32:22.026
as for your question,
let me rephrase it.

32:22.094 --> 32:24.962
Are we prepared
to defend ourselves?

32:25.030 --> 32:27.532
We are.

32:28.267 --> 32:32.671
Jonas...

32:32.738 --> 32:35.072
you can't take on
the federal government.

32:35.140 --> 32:40.645
Yeah, well, you never were
one for thinking big.

32:40.713 --> 32:43.548
20 years

32:43.616 --> 32:45.650
I treated you like a son.

32:45.718 --> 32:47.485
20 years.

32:47.553 --> 32:51.623
A little loyalty...

32:51.691 --> 32:54.759
wasn't that
the least I deserved?

33:44.410 --> 33:45.810
Yes.

33:45.878 --> 33:49.447
Sir, we just got an alert from
one of our radar intercepts.

33:49.515 --> 33:51.783
There's a squadron of F-18's

33:51.851 --> 33:55.219
heading our way
out of Virginia Beach.

33:55.287 --> 33:56.421
Sir?

33:56.489 --> 33:57.756
What's the ETA?

33:57.823 --> 33:59.290
Less than ten minutes.

33:59.358 --> 34:01.626
What's our readiness?
How many?

34:01.694 --> 34:04.996
We have three loaded.

34:05.063 --> 34:06.964
Place the call
to the president.

34:07.032 --> 34:10.268
I'll be there momentarily.

34:24.415 --> 34:27.083
You probably think I'm the scum
of the earth right now.

34:30.188 --> 34:33.357
All I care about is that you
don't run the Starkwood story.

34:33.424 --> 34:35.592
You're a real sport.

34:35.661 --> 34:37.862
Taking one for the team
like this.

34:44.569 --> 34:46.503
Look at me.

34:48.774 --> 34:51.809
You won't run it, right?

34:54.545 --> 34:56.513
I'm sorry, Livy.

34:56.581 --> 34:58.415
What?

35:02.287 --> 35:03.387
Breaking something
this big

35:03.454 --> 35:05.723
will put me over
the top in New York.

35:05.791 --> 35:09.293
I'll make sure nobody knows
any of it came from you.

35:09.360 --> 35:12.296
You lying son of a bitch.

35:12.363 --> 35:14.631
Come on, please.

35:14.700 --> 35:16.067
I'm did what I needed to do
to get ahead--

35:16.134 --> 35:17.802
just like you.

35:17.869 --> 35:20.304
There's no comparison.

35:20.371 --> 35:22.106
Running that story
will harm the country.

35:22.174 --> 35:25.109
I've been in Washington
a lot longer than you.

35:25.177 --> 35:27.812
You'll see, this is how
the way the game is played.

35:27.879 --> 35:31.048
Actually, Ken, this is how
the game is played.

35:33.952 --> 35:35.119
What do you mean?

35:51.236 --> 35:54.605
You run that story, or ever
try to blackmail me again,

35:54.672 --> 35:56.340
and I'll make sure
everyone knows

35:56.407 --> 35:58.475
just how you get your leads.

35:58.543 --> 35:59.710
I think your wife

35:59.778 --> 36:01.812
will be especially
interested.

36:01.880 --> 36:04.148
From everything
you've told me,

36:04.216 --> 36:06.016
that's gonna be
one nasty divorce.

36:06.084 --> 36:08.385
You bitch.

36:08.453 --> 36:11.188
Find a new beat, Ken.

36:11.256 --> 36:13.323
I don't want to see you around
the White House again.

36:15.794 --> 36:19.730
Sorry, I've got to take this.

36:30.008 --> 36:31.341
Hi.

36:31.409 --> 36:33.043
Where in the world are you?

36:33.111 --> 36:34.879
I'm sorry. I had a
meeting on K Street.

36:34.946 --> 36:36.647
I had to run interference
with a reporter.

36:36.714 --> 36:38.382
Are the press on to this?

36:38.449 --> 36:39.950
Not anymore.
I took care of it.

36:40.018 --> 36:41.318
I need you here, Livy.

36:41.386 --> 36:42.653
We've had confirmation
on the bioweapons,

36:42.720 --> 36:44.855
and the air strike
is happening now.

36:44.923 --> 36:46.257
I'll be there in five minutes.

36:57.969 --> 36:59.436
Where are we, Admiral?

36:59.504 --> 37:02.372
The F-18's have been loaded
with bunker-buster ordinance

37:02.440 --> 37:05.509
and will be in range
in seven minutes.

37:05.576 --> 37:07.744
What's the risk
of the pathogen spreading

37:07.813 --> 37:08.913
to the surrounding areas?

37:08.980 --> 37:10.347
Minimal.

37:10.415 --> 37:11.816
We're using white phosphorous
charges,

37:11.883 --> 37:13.083
which burn at 5,000 degrees.

37:13.151 --> 37:15.452
More than enough
to incinerate the pathogen.

37:15.520 --> 37:17.121
And that's been confirmed
by the CDC.

37:17.189 --> 37:18.755
It has.

37:24.863 --> 37:27.631
Weapons are ready?

37:27.699 --> 37:28.933
Yes, sir.

37:30.501 --> 37:33.070
The call to the president?

37:33.138 --> 37:35.239
The call is in process.

37:37.342 --> 37:39.276
It's an historic day,
gentlemen.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.445
A great day for Starkwood.

37:46.251 --> 37:49.253
Too bad Mr. Knowles
can't be joining us.

38:00.498 --> 38:03.500
<i>I have an ETAC
with eyes on. Airborne.</i>

38:03.568 --> 38:04.969
<i>Roger,
I need 9,000 feet</i>

38:05.036 --> 38:07.437
MSL and weapons control
status, over.

38:07.505 --> 38:09.606
<i>Weapons control status:</i>

38:09.674 --> 38:10.741
yellow tight.

38:10.808 --> 38:12.243
<i>Fighters entering the IP.</i>

38:12.310 --> 38:13.944
Engage airspace
coordination area.

38:14.012 --> 38:16.213
<i>Roger that.
Stand by.</i>

38:16.281 --> 38:18.515
Madam President, command
and control is reporting

38:18.583 --> 38:20.584
that a phased array radar system

38:20.651 --> 38:22.319
is active inside
the Starkwood compound.

38:22.387 --> 38:24.788
Meaning what exactly?

38:24.856 --> 38:26.490
They know we're coming.

38:26.557 --> 38:30.694
Is there any evidence of an
antiaircraft artillery threat?

38:30.762 --> 38:35.399
Intelligence is indicating no
such capability on the ground.

38:35.466 --> 38:37.935
Madam President,
there's a phone call for you.

38:38.003 --> 38:39.736
It's Jonas Hodges.

38:45.210 --> 38:46.310
Put him on speaker.

38:46.378 --> 38:47.844
Ma'am, he's requested

38:47.913 --> 38:49.046
a private conversation.

38:49.114 --> 38:50.347
He says he's established
a proprietary line

38:50.415 --> 38:52.649
in the Ops Room.

38:52.717 --> 38:54.785
A proprietary line?

38:54.852 --> 38:56.353
How did he manage that?

38:56.421 --> 38:58.488
I have no idea.

39:24.849 --> 39:26.683
Hello.

39:26.751 --> 39:29.420
Madam President,
let me begin by saying

39:29.487 --> 39:31.888
that I am truly sorry
it's come to this.

39:31.957 --> 39:36.260
at you turn your planes
around immediately.

39:36.328 --> 39:40.264
You're in no position to
issue ultimatums, Mr. Hodges.

39:40.332 --> 39:43.067
Well, maybe I am.

39:43.134 --> 39:46.136
You remember several years ago,
Madam President,

39:46.204 --> 39:48.772
Starkwood was deployed
to Pakistan.

39:48.840 --> 39:50.841
Oh, I remember it
very well.

39:50.908 --> 39:52.276
I fought that deployment.

39:52.344 --> 39:53.777
And you lost.

39:53.845 --> 39:55.079
You'll also recall

39:55.146 --> 39:58.048
that we requisitioned a missile
system at that time--

39:58.116 --> 39:59.583
Python Fives.

39:59.650 --> 40:01.118
Well, three of those missiles

40:01.186 --> 40:02.552
are now loaded
with the pathogen

40:02.620 --> 40:05.655
and aimed at cities
on our eastern seaboard.

40:09.527 --> 40:11.028
You're bluffing.

40:11.096 --> 40:14.631
As a sign of good faith,

40:14.699 --> 40:18.935
I'm willing to show you that
I'm... that I'm not bluffing.

40:22.507 --> 40:24.441
You see that?

40:24.509 --> 40:26.743
Madam President?

40:26.811 --> 40:28.445
Hmm?

40:34.185 --> 40:35.986
You call this good faith?

40:36.054 --> 40:39.256
You are waging war
on your own country, Jonas.

40:39.324 --> 40:41.825
Well, of course,
I wouldn't see it that way.

40:41.893 --> 40:45.429
What do you want?

40:45.497 --> 40:48.332
Well, we can have
that conversation

40:48.400 --> 40:50.534
a little later on
at the White House.

40:50.601 --> 40:54.038
You think we're going to just
sit down and discuss this?

40:54.105 --> 40:56.407
Yes I do,
in the Oval Office,

40:56.474 --> 40:57.774
in confidence,

40:57.842 --> 40:59.076
within the hour.

40:59.144 --> 41:02.346
But in the meantime,
I think it is

41:02.414 --> 41:03.514
to both of our advantage

41:03.581 --> 41:05.715
that the American
people do not know

41:05.783 --> 41:08.018
the exact circumstance
of this standoff.

41:08.086 --> 41:10.720
So you will keep this
conversation to yourself,

41:10.788 --> 41:12.589
and turn the planes around.

41:12.657 --> 41:15.459
And if you don't comply,
Madam President,

41:15.527 --> 41:19.796
I will have no choice
but to launch those missiles.

41:21.166 --> 41:23.267
Mr. Hodges...

41:23.334 --> 41:26.336
And remember, I can detect
any action you take

41:26.404 --> 41:27.804
against our facility.

41:27.872 --> 41:31.175
You have 30 seconds.

41:31.242 --> 41:32.776
Mr. Hodges...

41:32.843 --> 41:34.611
Mr. Hodges!

42:02.940 --> 42:04.874
Abort the air strike,
Admiral Smith.

42:04.942 --> 42:07.077
Madam President...

42:07.145 --> 42:08.512
Just do as I say.

42:13.884 --> 42:15.085
Ma'am, with all respect...

42:15.153 --> 42:18.122
Damn it, Admiral, abort
the air strike immediately!

42:19.157 --> 42:20.491
This is Admiral Smith.

42:20.558 --> 42:22.259
I have an abort order
from the president.

42:22.327 --> 42:23.727
Take fighters off target.

42:23.794 --> 42:25.095
Repeat: take fighters

42:25.163 --> 42:26.296
off target.

42:26.364 --> 42:27.864
Stand by for
confirmation code.

42:37.041 --> 42:39.809
We're standing down,
Madam President.
