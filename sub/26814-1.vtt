- Just hold it together,
Vic, we have to think.

24:01.570 --> 24:04.051
- [Marcus] Goddammnit,
there's gotta' be an exit.

24:04.181 --> 24:06.096
- [Jay] Yeah, it's
a school right?

24:06.227 --> 24:07.533
There has to be a fire
exit or something.

24:07.663 --> 24:10.057
- Yeah.
- We're all gonna die.

24:10.187 --> 24:12.494
- [Marcus] Yo, shut
the fuck up, man!

24:12.625 --> 24:14.191
- Alright, let's stay together.

24:14.322 --> 24:15.323
Vic, you good?

24:15.454 --> 24:16.933
- Fuck no, I'm not good!

24:17.064 --> 24:18.239
What the hell is this?

24:18.369 --> 24:20.894
What's happening,
what about Luke?

24:21.024 --> 24:22.286
- I don't know, man. Come on.

24:22.417 --> 24:23.287
We gotta' go though.

24:23.418 --> 24:25.072
We gotta' go. The gas station.

24:25.202 --> 24:26.073
It had a pay phone.

24:26.203 --> 24:27.466
We can call someone from there.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.337
Come on, come on.

24:31.731 --> 24:32.471
- It sounds clear.

24:33.863 --> 24:34.516
Let's go!

24:41.784 --> 24:44.483
[hallowed music]

25:28.265 --> 25:32.269
- Father, I accept the tasks
that you have given me.

25:34.271 --> 25:36.273
I will continue the
holy work that you have

25:36.404 --> 25:37.753
ordained me to do.

25:41.061 --> 25:42.758
I ask for your
forgiveness for the sins

25:42.889 --> 25:45.282
that I have committed,
and for the sins that

25:45.413 --> 25:47.546
I must commit in the future.

26:43.079 --> 26:44.341
- Fuck these windows, man!

26:48.955 --> 26:50.434
- [Marcus] There's gotta be a
window without bars on here.

26:50.565 --> 26:52.088
- Yo, look!

26:52.219 --> 26:52.915
- What is she doing?

26:53.046 --> 26:53.699
- Let's go see.

26:59.095 --> 27:00.314
[screaming]

27:00.444 --> 27:03.056
Hey, look, hey.

27:03.186 --> 27:04.361
Do you know a way out of here?

27:06.537 --> 27:09.758
- Our friend just got killed,
and we need to get help.

27:09.889 --> 27:11.673
Do you know where we
can get help, please.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.240
- I don't think
you understand, ok!

27:13.370 --> 27:14.284
Our friend is dead.

27:14.415 --> 27:15.982
He's fucking dead, ok!

27:16.112 --> 27:17.113
And we need to find a door,
or window, or something

27:17.244 --> 27:18.637
and get the fuck out of here!
- Marcus!

27:18.767 --> 27:19.942
Marcus!
- What?

27:20.073 --> 27:21.552
- Just calm down,
dude, just chill out.

27:22.815 --> 27:24.294
Hey, is this the way out?

27:32.825 --> 27:34.261
- [Vic] Move, move.

27:38.091 --> 27:40.659
[ominous music]

27:47.143 --> 27:49.276
- What the hell?

27:49.406 --> 27:52.453
- This is bad, this
is real, real bad.

27:58.415 --> 27:59.199
- Amy, Amy?

28:01.941 --> 28:04.073
- We're not staying in here.

28:05.553 --> 28:07.686
Tell me how to leave,
how do we fucking leave?

28:09.122 --> 28:09.731
- We have to help
my sister, please.

28:09.862 --> 28:11.298
- Just shut the fuck up!

28:11.428 --> 28:13.126
Tell me how to leave, now!

28:13.256 --> 28:16.477
- Hey calm down, the fuck
man, you gonna hit me?

28:16.607 --> 28:18.131
- Both of you stop it!

28:18.261 --> 28:20.089
We have no time for that shit.

28:20.220 --> 28:22.178
Luke is dead, and
there's something really

28:22.309 --> 28:23.876
bad happening here.

28:24.006 --> 28:26.835
There's a fucking girl
on a fucking cross!

28:26.966 --> 28:29.490
- I'm sorry, bro,
it's this place, man.

28:29.620 --> 28:30.752
It's fucking with me.

28:30.883 --> 28:32.449
I just gotta, gotta'
get out of here.

28:32.580 --> 28:33.973
- [Marcus] It's fucking
with us all, man.

28:34.103 --> 28:36.018
- Please help me get her down.

28:36.149 --> 28:38.412
I'll tell you where
to go, just help me.

28:38.542 --> 28:40.980
- Yeah yeah I have a knife here.

29:00.086 --> 29:02.741
[groaning]
- Amy?

29:04.220 --> 29:07.876
Amy, hey, Amy, Amy,
it's me, Shannon, Amy?

29:10.879 --> 29:13.447
- Holy shit, dude,
this is that girl.

29:13.577 --> 29:14.927
- What? What girl?

29:15.057 --> 29:16.798
- That girl, man, on the news.

29:16.929 --> 29:18.757
She got kidnapped or
ran away or something.

29:18.887 --> 29:20.671
Some senator's
daughter or something.

29:20.802 --> 29:21.498
- No way.

29:21.629 --> 29:23.196
- Yes way, man.

29:23.326 --> 29:25.546
My mom makes me watch that
shit with her every day.

29:25.676 --> 29:27.417
I remember her face.

29:27.548 --> 29:28.767
It was a long time ago.

29:28.897 --> 29:30.420
- Shit man, we gotta'
get to a pay phone.

29:31.639 --> 29:32.640
- [Shannon] It's me, Shannon.

29:35.077 --> 29:37.166
- You told us that you
would tell us where to go.

29:38.515 --> 29:39.342
Now, where do we go?

29:42.563 --> 29:44.173
- I don't know.

29:44.304 --> 29:45.435
- You don't know,
what do you mean--

29:45.566 --> 29:46.306
- Stop!

29:50.266 --> 29:52.965
- I don't but she does she's
been here longer than me.

29:56.446 --> 29:57.186
- Hey.

30:01.887 --> 30:04.324
Your sister said that you
know how to get out of here.

30:04.454 --> 30:06.717
If you tell us where
to go, we can help you.

30:06.848 --> 30:09.459
You can go home.
[growling]

30:21.689 --> 30:23.125
- She says she can show you.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.563
She says she can show you.

30:26.694 --> 30:27.477
- That works, too.

30:45.104 --> 30:49.848
- No, don't touch her!
[screaming]

30:51.240 --> 30:54.461
- Ok, ok, I'm sorry,
I didn't know.

30:54.591 --> 30:57.507
- Ok, hey we won't
touch her, I promise.

30:57.638 --> 30:58.378
We can help you.

30:59.596 --> 31:01.250
We just need to get out first.

31:01.381 --> 31:02.773
We need to leave this place.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.688
So can you please just
tell us where to go?

31:27.146 --> 31:28.451
- Yo, yo guys, my knife!

31:30.584 --> 31:31.280
Yo, where's my knife?

31:31.411 --> 31:32.238
It was right here.

31:33.935 --> 31:35.154
- Look, I don't know
man, but we gotta' go.

31:35.284 --> 31:36.155
Let's go, come on!

31:48.994 --> 31:51.387
[eerie music]

32:15.803 --> 32:17.326
- Father, fill me
with your spirit,

32:18.414 --> 32:19.633
and give me your strength.

32:21.026 --> 32:23.158
I will bring your
righteous vengeance down

32:23.289 --> 32:24.638
upon these sinners,

32:27.423 --> 32:28.947
I am your instrument.

32:47.878 --> 32:48.662
Yes!

32:53.623 --> 32:54.929
Thank you, father.

33:12.599 --> 33:15.384
[foreboding music]

34:15.009 --> 34:18.056
[anticipatory music]

34:28.414 --> 34:30.068
- This place is wrong, guys.

34:30.197 --> 34:31.895
This whole place is wrong.

34:32.025 --> 34:34.507
Did you see her mouth,
it's all fucked up.

34:34.637 --> 34:37.292
- It's that guy, it has to be.

34:37.422 --> 34:40.078
He killed Luke, and he's
doing some crazy shit

34:40.208 --> 34:40.904
to these girls.

34:42.688 --> 34:44.473
- Look, we're gonna call
the cops when we get out.

34:44.603 --> 34:47.215
The cops, FBI, all of 'em.

34:47.346 --> 34:48.824
We're gonna bring a shitstorm
down on this fucker.

34:52.351 --> 34:54.657
- I hope this girl
knows where she's going.

34:54.788 --> 34:57.834
- [Vic] How big do you think
this school is anyways?

34:57.965 --> 34:59.140
- [Jay] It's too
fucking big, man.

35:00.272 --> 35:00.968
- He could be anywhere.

35:02.752 --> 35:06.408
- Look, there's three of us,
there's only one of him, ok?

35:06.539 --> 35:07.235
- Yeah.

35:08.758 --> 35:10.760
- He won't get the drop
on us like he did Luke.

35:10.891 --> 35:11.979
- He's gonna pay for that.

35:30.215 --> 35:31.129
- Hey, look!

35:39.180 --> 35:40.921
Motherfucker, that's
our boards, man!

35:41.051 --> 35:44.838
- [Marcus] Chill out, he
can hear you, calm down.

36:27.359 --> 36:28.838
- Oh shit, oh fuck...

36:32.842 --> 36:34.279
That's Luke, man, oh no.

36:34.409 --> 36:37.586
- What, where, what
are you talking about?

36:41.764 --> 36:43.026
Dude, dude, what?

36:45.899 --> 36:47.205
- The shoes, man.

36:48.554 --> 36:50.208
- Where?
- Dude, what?

37:10.228 --> 37:10.967
- No.

37:26.331 --> 37:27.114
No.

37:41.650 --> 37:42.477
- Luke, man!

38:17.556 --> 38:18.296
Let's go.

38:43.843 --> 38:44.931
Keep going, go.

38:58.248 --> 39:00.425
[whistling]

40:31.733 --> 40:34.344
[cheerful music]

41:11.556 --> 41:14.123
[ominous music]

41:21.696 --> 41:26.484
- Wait, were are
we, what is this?

41:27.528 --> 41:28.355
- Yeah, what the fuck is this?

41:28.486 --> 41:32.228
[screaming in foreign language]

41:38.408 --> 41:41.150
- What the hell are
we listening to?

41:42.978 --> 41:45.328
- Hey hey hey what's happening?

41:46.939 --> 41:48.680
- Fuck this, man.

41:48.810 --> 41:50.899
Hey, this isn't the way out.

41:51.030 --> 41:52.379
This isn't the way out!

41:52.510 --> 41:53.902
Show me the way out!

41:54.033 --> 41:55.513
Look at me, you stupid bitch...

41:55.643 --> 41:58.559
[screaming]
What the?

42:11.616 --> 42:13.922
[screaming]

42:17.404 --> 42:19.928
- Oh God, oh God!
- Oh God, oh no.

42:22.322 --> 42:24.193
- What did she do to me?

42:25.151 --> 42:27.545
[screaming]

42:31.374 --> 42:32.941
Marcus, I can't see!

42:33.072 --> 42:36.249
- We're here we're right here.
- I can't see anything.

42:39.731 --> 42:41.471
What's, what's going...

42:43.082 --> 42:44.344
- Hey, man.

42:44.474 --> 42:47.173
Look, our friend,
he needs a doctor.

42:48.609 --> 42:50.306
If you just let us
take him to a doctor,

42:50.437 --> 42:52.047
we won't say anything, ok?
[speaking foreign language]

42:52.178 --> 42:52.918
- Marcus!

42:54.659 --> 42:58.097
[speaking foreign language]

43:11.763 --> 43:14.592
- May he free you from your
sins and grant you relief.

43:29.955 --> 43:31.696
Naomi, Martha, come here.

43:38.137 --> 43:41.749
Martha, do you know why Naomi
was in the penance room?

43:43.142 --> 43:44.447
- Yes.

43:44.578 --> 43:47.581
- Yes, and yet, you
still released her.

43:49.322 --> 43:50.584
- Yes.

43:50.715 --> 43:53.805
- This death is
your responsibility.

43:53.935 --> 43:57.635
This boy's blood
is on your hands.

44:00.115 --> 44:01.247
- [Marcus] You're the
one holding the knife.

44:04.380 --> 44:05.643
- You know, I find
it interesting that

44:05.773 --> 44:08.297
the first person to
promise not to say anything

44:08.428 --> 44:11.039
is usually the first person
to open their mouth to show

44:11.170 --> 44:13.694
that saying anything is the
first thing that they'd do.

44:16.697 --> 44:20.309
You know, Naomi here had
problems saying things too.

44:20.440 --> 44:22.398
But we fixed that
didn't we dear.

44:24.313 --> 44:26.838
You still have a lot of work
to do with your self control.

44:30.668 --> 44:31.843
Martha, Martha!

44:33.366 --> 44:36.151
Take Naomi, and go to your room,

44:36.282 --> 44:39.764
and get cleaned up and wait
for me in the sanctuary.

44:39.894 --> 44:40.634
Understood?

44:40.765 --> 44:41.809
- Yes.

44:41.940 --> 44:43.158
- Go, go!

44:50.035 --> 44:52.777
Are you both aware that
trespassing, vandalism,

44:52.907 --> 44:54.735
and drug use are
criminal offenses?

44:56.955 --> 44:59.914
So you know this, yet you
continue to do these things.

45:03.309 --> 45:05.485
[laughing]

45:09.532 --> 45:11.970
God himself will provide the
lamb for the burned offering.

45:21.762 --> 45:24.547
[screaming]

45:24.678 --> 45:25.418
- Go! Go!

45:34.862 --> 45:35.471
- Which way?
- I don't know, man!

45:35.602 --> 45:36.821
Any way! Just go!

45:38.997 --> 45:41.564
[screaming]

45:41.695 --> 45:42.435
Come on!

45:59.017 --> 46:00.235
- Fuck, man, fuck!

46:00.366 --> 46:01.889
Where's he going?
Where's he going?

46:02.020 --> 46:04.239
- I don't know, man, just
keep running keep running!

46:07.503 --> 46:09.157
[speaking foreign language]

46:09.288 --> 46:11.507
[screaming]

46:15.990 --> 46:16.730
- Stop it!

46:19.037 --> 46:22.649
Stop it, stop it please!

46:22.780 --> 46:24.042
Stop!

46:24.172 --> 46:26.566
- Get up, please, so we can go!

46:31.005 --> 46:32.311
- [Shannon] Stop!

46:47.152 --> 46:49.502
- Martha, you need to be still.

46:52.766 --> 46:54.289
- My name is Shannon.

47:06.345 --> 47:08.651
- [Joseph] Your name is Martha.

47:10.044 --> 47:11.263
- Shannon.

47:11.393 --> 47:13.613
- Shannon is a whore, a
harlot, and a jezebel.

47:14.919 --> 47:18.270
Martha is pure and obedient.

47:20.098 --> 47:21.664
That's a good girl.

47:21.795 --> 47:23.057
Now we can move forward.

47:24.842 --> 47:27.409
Naomi, take this away now.

47:28.628 --> 47:30.282
- [Naomi] Yes, father.

47:32.284 --> 47:33.154
- I'll be right back.

47:36.941 --> 47:40.858
- Amy, Amy, Amy...

47:40.988 --> 47:41.728
Help me.

47:43.773 --> 47:44.731
Amy, help me.

47:46.776 --> 47:48.474
- What did you say?

47:48.604 --> 47:49.562
- [Shannon] Help me,
help me, help me...

47:52.521 --> 47:56.961
- Shut up shut up shut up shut
up shut up shut up shut up!

48:00.007 --> 48:01.269
- [Joseph] Naomi!

48:03.358 --> 48:04.925
Go to your room!

48:05.056 --> 48:06.971
I will be in to
hear your confession

48:07.101 --> 48:09.060
