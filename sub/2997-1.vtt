02:56.000 --> 02:58.440
You talk, we cut your face, hear?

02:58.920 --> 03:01.520
Your purse. Put it in my hand, bitch.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.800
I said put it in my hand!

03:09.560 --> 03:12.480
You busted my mouth!

03:13.920 --> 03:16.080
- Come on, he-man.
- I'll cut you, man.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.720
I got the hots for ya.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.480
Drop it. Drop it!

03:23.600 --> 03:25.360
Drop it!

04:00.600 --> 04:03.400
You got one more shot to drop it, man.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.720
- I'll cut you, man.
- Come on, badass.

04:05.840 --> 04:08.800
Come on. Cut me, badass.
Come on. Come for me.

04:12.560 --> 04:14.200
Come on.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.480
Come on! Come on, badass.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.720
You got the right to a legal counsel.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.560
You have the right to remain silent.

04:37.680 --> 04:42.520
And anything you say can be
used in a court of law against you.

04:42.640 --> 04:43.560
Amen.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.000
Excuse me.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.720
- Oh, it's warm in here.
- Isn't it, though?

05:53.840 --> 05:57.960
- May I help you with anything?
- Yes, yes. Something special.

05:58.920 --> 06:02.120
Oh, yes. I think you might be
interested in something like this.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.520
That's good. What is it?

06:04.640 --> 06:09.400
I think you'd be interested in this
more, sir. Would you like to smell it?

06:11.360 --> 06:14.120
- What do you think?
- Would you wrap it up for me?

06:14.240 --> 06:17.120
- I'll be back in a couple of minutes.
- All right.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.200
You really are very pretty.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.440
Well, thank you.

06:50.960 --> 06:53.720
United Press.

06:53.840 --> 06:58.280
I have an announcement to make
for your international wire.

06:58.400 --> 07:03.000
The Wulfgar Command has just struck
a blow against British colonialism.

07:03.120 --> 07:06.160
Be warned that I have a long arm...

07:06.280 --> 07:10.480
and I'm prepared to fight
my enemies wherever they may be.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.560
Don't forget...

07:12.680 --> 07:15.040
there's no security.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.600
Police!

09:17.720 --> 09:20.880
- Put your hands up! Against the wall!
- Move! Move!

09:22.720 --> 09:25.560
What the fuck is this shit?
How much shit you want, man?

09:25.680 --> 09:27.480
How much for this motherfuckin' shit?

09:27.600 --> 09:29.640
- Who you talkin' to?
- You, pig!

09:29.760 --> 09:33.760
- Who the fuck you talkin' to?
- You, pig! How much money you want?

09:33.880 --> 09:36.480
- Shut up, man.
- Shut up, my ass! How much...?

09:40.760 --> 09:44.520
I want you to pay for every life you've
wasted on this shit, motherfucker!

09:44.640 --> 09:46.440
- Motherfucker!
- Let him go, Matt.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.680
That ain't worth it, man.

09:51.680 --> 09:54.000
I said he ain't worth it.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.600
Let him go, Matt.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.800
Matt, let him go.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.600
If I ever see you again,
I'm gonna kill you.

10:06.720 --> 10:09.920
Do you hear me? I'm gonna kill you.
Now you get over there.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.920
Now move! Move!

10:15.080 --> 10:16.840
Move!

10:20.520 --> 10:24.840
All right, keep your hands up. Let's go.
We're all goin' downtown. Come on.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.600
Come on, kid.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.280
- I could use some coffee. You?
- Yeah, sure.

10:40.400 --> 10:44.840
I went to a party last night.
I'm not used to this nightlife.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.440
- How does that feel?
- Good. Both sides look OK.

10:51.320 --> 10:53.480
- Let the lady out.
- I'll be cool.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.440
Wait a minute. We got things to do now.

11:01.560 --> 11:05.680
- Why do you have to see her now?
- Just cover me for ten minutes.

11:05.800 --> 11:09.040
- I want to see her now, that's all.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

11:09.160 --> 11:13.280
- I'll call on her. Don't worry.
- Don't hang around too long, OK?

11:13.400 --> 11:15.520
- I'll be ten minutes.
- Well, hurry up.

11:15.640 --> 11:18.600
Take your hat off, at least. Jesus Christ.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.680
Please, let me help you out.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.240
Irene, I think the pleat you added
to my summer-skirt design is fantastic.

11:41.360 --> 11:45.520
Incidentally, there's an important
buyer coming by in a few days.

11:45.640 --> 11:50.840
It might be a good career move for you
if you'd escort him to dinner and such.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.720
Think it over.

12:07.440 --> 12:09.800
Deke, what are you doing back here?

12:09.920 --> 12:13.080
I came up the back way so I didn't
embarrass you in this get-up.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.320
Very chic!
Why are you dressed like that?

12:15.440 --> 12:17.400
Me and Fox just got back from the Bronx.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.080
- Were you cruising?
- Nah, dope bust.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.200
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah, fine.

12:24.200 --> 12:27.360
- So how are you doin'?
- Great. Yeah.

12:27.960 --> 12:32.560
- Being promoted next week, even.
- Is that right? That's good.

12:32.680 --> 12:37.720
Why did you come by? I've gotta get back
to work. I've got a million things to do.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.760
Well, I was wonderin'
if maybe later tonight...

12:41.880 --> 12:44.560
we could spend some time together?

12:54.200 --> 12:56.360
What do you want from me, Deke?

12:57.360 --> 12:59.720
- What do you want from me?
- What?

13:00.680 --> 13:03.640
Look, maybe I made a few mistakes.
I admit that, all right?

13:03.760 --> 13:07.520
Look, you wouldn't like living
with me again. You really wouldn't.

13:07.640 --> 13:12.000
- Irene, I know what I like.
- Well, it isn't the right time, anyway.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.560
This is not the right time.

13:14.680 --> 13:15.720
People grow, Deke.

13:15.840 --> 13:19.160
I don't understand why you can't
get transferred off the streets.

13:19.280 --> 13:21.760
Why do you have to do
these insane kinda things?

13:21.880 --> 13:24.720
Why the hell can't you change?

13:25.200 --> 13:27.000
I did.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.440
Can I come by tonight?

13:39.920 --> 13:41.680
Can I?

13:42.920 --> 13:47.080
Why didn't you ever pay this much
attention when I was with you?

13:48.440 --> 13:51.800
Cos I didn't know what
it'd be like without you.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.360
I have to get back to work.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.280
I have to go.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.360
I've really got a million things to do.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.640
We'll talk later, all right?

14:32.480 --> 14:37.800
Listen, I've always seen you hanging about
college, but no one knows what you do.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.360
Does it matter? I'm in business.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.000
Don't run away now.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.480
I really am a remarkable fellow.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.520
Kenna, you look a bit nervous.
Mercer sent my money?

15:16.080 --> 15:19.440
Not this trip. They want to
talk to you about that bomb.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.600
Mercer says it was overdone.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.280
Several children were killed.
It hurt the movement.

15:24.400 --> 15:28.160
Don't your people realize what it
costs to run an operation like this?

15:28.280 --> 15:31.240
I work miracles for them.

15:31.720 --> 15:35.000
Kenna... where were you since Friday?

15:36.720 --> 15:41.120
They picked me up at the airport
and they held me over the weekend.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.360
- The police?
- No worry at all.

15:45.880 --> 15:50.440
- But you still came here.
- You know I'd never tell them anything.

16:05.240 --> 16:07.400
You already have.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.200
Move.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.080
You go to a better life.

16:53.360 --> 16:56.160
- Excuse me, Inspector.
- Where's that bastard Hartman?

16:56.280 --> 16:58.880
He's over at the back of the crowd, sir.

17:01.080 --> 17:04.160
- What's going on here?
- Can you tell us anything?

17:04.280 --> 17:07.200
I don't want to hear a word from you,
Hartman, that you warned us.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.680
Not one word, understand?

17:15.760 --> 17:21.800
One of these days it would be nice if
someone listened before it was too late.

17:21.920 --> 17:26.040
First the bombing, then three men
come to get him, and he gets them.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.680
He's becoming quite a legend here, sir.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.960
Maybe. But even a legend can go too far.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.800
He's now killed one of his own.

17:34.920 --> 17:40.840
A man in his position has to worry as
much about his friends as his enemies.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.800
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

19:51.920 --> 19:54.520
You fool,
where the hell have you been?

19:55.600 --> 19:58.080
Wulfgar, you must be out of your mind
to bring me here,

19:59.120 --> 20:00.680
right next to police headquarters.

20:01.040 --> 20:04.400
Couldn't you find another meeting place,
other than Sainte Chapelle?

20:05.120 --> 20:06.120
I go where I like.

20:06.520 --> 20:07.920
My payment... let me have it.

20:16.400 --> 20:17.840
A ticket to Madrid?

20:19.240 --> 20:20.480
50 pounds?

20:24.040 --> 20:26.080
Is Mercer joking, or what?

20:26.760 --> 20:28.200
Mercer sent me.

20:29.080 --> 20:32.600
But the killing of his courier
will not be forgotten.

20:33.320 --> 20:36.320
He wasn't one of my people. He brought
the police to my door, the idiot.

20:37.160 --> 20:40.400
An idiot with your photo in his pocket.

20:41.320 --> 20:41.920
Yes.

20:42.280 --> 20:44.680
He had brought you your passport.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.440
Interpol has your photo now,

20:48.000 --> 20:49.200
and that was very stupid.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.520
Have you spoken to Hammad?

20:52.000 --> 20:55.080
He thinks you are a dead man soon.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.320
He needs my help.

20:57.680 --> 21:00.360
He needs someone
who believes in his cause.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.200
But where can you work?

21:02.840 --> 21:05.480
You can't show your face anywhere.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.160
We'll see.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.120
It's going down.

21:56.960 --> 22:00.240
- DaSilva, they want you downtown.
- What?! You blew his cover!

22:00.360 --> 22:03.240
- Hey, that ain't my problem, pal.
- It ain't your problem?!

22:03.360 --> 22:05.240
What the fuck do you want here?

22:05.360 --> 22:08.040
- Who do you think you're talkin' to?
- I'm talkin' to you!

22:08.160 --> 22:11.240
Don't ever come around on
our detail again, understand?

22:11.360 --> 22:14.120
- Don't go shittin' me.
- You wanna say somethin' to me?

22:14.240 --> 22:16.840
You do that again,
I'll break your fuckin' face!

22:16.960 --> 22:19.800
Fuckin' glory boys.
Nobody likes your crap.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.880
None of ya. Neither one of ya.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.680
They make anybody a sergeant now.
Kiss my ass, Fox!

22:25.800 --> 22:28.160
I'm gonna kick your ass!

22:30.840 --> 22:32.800
Wise-ass!

22:32.920 --> 22:35.120
What you got?

22:35.240 --> 22:38.560
You know we can't come back
here again, you know that?

22:38.680 --> 22:40.680
- Bitch.
- All the time...

22:40.800 --> 22:43.960
What is this?
Let's get back to headquarters.

22:44.920 --> 22:47.160
Don't litter.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.240
- You littered.
- So arrest me!

23:11.760 --> 23:15.080
Our mutual contacts insisted
that I see you today.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.920
Normally I do not operate on Sunday.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.240
You must be quite important to them.

23:22.240 --> 23:26.240
Make yourself comfortable, I will show you
photos which will help you choose.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.720
Please have a seat.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.600
This one would be perfect for your face.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.120
Notice the contours,
strong and well-defined.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.400
Not for me.

23:47.080 --> 23:48.720
With the nostril more open then.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.560
Not for me.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.480
What do you want?

23:53.240 --> 23:56.560
A smaller nose
and do something with his jaw line.

23:57.000 --> 23:57.800
Yes, of course.

23:58.200 --> 24:00.440
And the eyes can be made blue
with lenses?

24:04.800 --> 24:07.240
Yes, I think we can do that.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.600
Good, but do it fast.

24:09.960 --> 24:12.360
What do you want exactly?

24:14.080 --> 24:16.080
I want to be beautiful.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.960
- Lieutenant?
- Right here.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.400
I just got these latest transfer orders...

24:28.520 --> 24:31.800
Don't sing me no operas today.
I don't feel good and I'm rushed.

24:31.920 --> 24:36.880
I'm not singin' any operas.
I'm talkin' about these transfer orders.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.800
Look, come on, Munafo.

24:38.920 --> 24:42.920
For nine years I've been workin' decoy.
Now I'm pulled and I'd like to know why.

24:43.040 --> 24:47.200
Look, you don't know me well enough to
call me Munafo, but I know you, DaSilva.

24:47.320 --> 24:50.200
The gung-Lone Ranger
of the street-crime unit?

24:50.320 --> 24:52.120
You can forget about that.

24:52.240 --> 24:55.680
We've been asked to cooperate
with the Special Federal State Unit.

24:55.800 --> 24:59.880
- You two are assigned to an ATAC group.
- Come on! Terrorism, hijack, hostages...

25:00.000 --> 25:02.160
That's FBI stuff.
What do they want with us?

25:02.280 --> 25:04.720
Your military records had
something to do with it.

25:04.840 --> 25:07.440
How many times you been
hospitalized this year? Five?

25:07.560 --> 25:10.680
Consider this squad a vacation from decoy.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.960
- I don't need a vacation from decoy.
- Oh, yes, you do.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.640
They need someone
who knows the local rat holes.

25:16.760 --> 25:19.800
- Anything goes down, you're the man.
- Where did this come from?

25:19.920 --> 25:23.360
The commissioner. He got it from
Washington. Specialists from Europe...

25:23.480 --> 25:27.040
Interpol, will help organize it
in conjunction with Federal funding.

25:27.160 --> 25:30.240
And this department will extend
every courtesy, understand?

25:30.360 --> 25:32.320
- No, I don't...
- Get your hands off me!

25:32.440 --> 25:36.160
Understand this, sucker! You're a cop
and you'll go where you're assigned!

25:36.280 --> 25:40.280
Now you and Tonto be here tomorrow
at eight o'clock sharp! End of story!

25:54.000 --> 25:55.480
Damn!

25:57.080 --> 26:00.960
High-gain antennae,
four mobile units, two on wheels...

26:01.080 --> 26:04.560
plus one helicopter and
another moored at the battery.

26:04.680 --> 26:09.160
Direct telex... to Interpol Paris
and all of Western Europe.

26:09.720 --> 26:13.360
Computer banks which
give total information.

26:13.480 --> 26:17.240
Retrieval on every known
terrorist in the world.

26:20.040 --> 26:22.640
Some of you may wonder
why you have been selected.

26:22.760 --> 26:28.520
Simply because of your unique qualities,
field record, courage, etc, etc.

26:29.720 --> 26:33.280
You are to be indoctrinated
in counterterrorist techniques...

26:33.400 --> 26:38.640
which will enable you to meet your
terrorist adversary on equal terms.

26:38.760 --> 26:41.160
Air France passenger
Andrew Dunham...

26:41.280 --> 26:44.240
please pick up a white courtesy phone...

26:47.680 --> 26:50.160
Is this trip business or pleasure?

26:50.280 --> 26:52.120
Pleasure, I hope.

26:52.240 --> 26:54.400
Welcome to the United States.

26:55.880 --> 26:59.080
The ATAC squad - that's the
Antiterrorist Action Command -

26:59.200 --> 27:02.600
has been formed due to a serious
lack of ruthlessness by the police.

27:02.720 --> 27:06.240
- What are we doin' here?
- They've become bland.

27:06.360 --> 27:09.320
First lesson: Threat equals fire power.

27:09.920 --> 27:13.760
Terrorists, though relatively few
in number, rely on massive fire power.

27:13.880 --> 27:17.200
Fragmentation grenades,
other improvised explosive devices.

27:17.320 --> 27:20.800
Law-enforcement officials,
on the other hand, are poorly armed...

27:20.920 --> 27:24.160
indoctrinated in the use
of non-deadly force...

27:24.280 --> 27:29.520
and, to a great extent, are not
proficient in what weapons they do have.

27:38.640 --> 27:42.200
Department policy, reluctance to fire,
police-public relations...

27:42.320 --> 27:44.520
human rights, civil rights...

27:44.640 --> 27:48.160
safety orientation, necessary
when dealing with civilians...

27:48.280 --> 27:50.640
but catastrophic with terrorists.

27:50.760 --> 27:54.520
- Pay attention?
- The most important rule is...

27:55.600 --> 27:57.640
hesitation kills.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.120
Hesitation must be removed
from the policeman.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.120
Are you sure that
this guy's even in the city?

28:14.240 --> 28:20.120
The latest information, as gathered by
the Interpol computer bank, supports this.

28:20.240 --> 28:23.480
He isn't comfortable in Europe.
No one will hire him.

28:23.600 --> 28:26.880
Africa, Asia, the Middle East,
South America...

28:27.000 --> 28:28.920
They've got enough revolutionaries.

28:29.040 --> 28:33.720
But if you wanted worldwide press
coverage... New York. Where else?

28:34.440 --> 28:39.120
What about the possibility that he
could have retired or gone into hiding?

28:39.240 --> 28:41.600
Sergeant Fox, isn't it?

28:41.720 --> 28:46.480
The answer to the possibility
of Wulfgar's retirement, sir, is...

28:46.600 --> 28:47.960
he's only beginning.

29:05.760 --> 29:07.720
Go ahead.

29:08.880 --> 29:13.440
In 72 hours, I want each of you to know
every detail of his past operations.

29:13.800 --> 29:17.320
We must make use of
every bit of time we have.

29:17.440 --> 29:20.200
I assure you Wulfgar isn't wasting his.

29:44.880 --> 29:49.360
International terrorism, gentlemen,
is a worldwide organization...

29:49.480 --> 29:53.960
and the man who runs like a thread
through the majority of all of it is one...

29:54.080 --> 29:56.400
alias Wulfgar.

29:57.080 --> 29:59.880
There was a plastic surgeon
murdered in Paris recently.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.920
The method and caliber of bullet used...

30:02.040 --> 30:05.000
was the same as Wulfgar has used
in similar assassinations.

30:05.120 --> 30:08.440
So, gentlemen, he may now
look entirely different.

30:08.560 --> 30:11.200
The man truly enjoys killing.

30:11.320 --> 30:14.760
Don't start trouble, OK? Why are
you always such a troublemaker?

30:14.880 --> 30:17.480
His pattern is that he makes
female contacts...

30:17.600 --> 30:20.200
to establish safe
housing for his armory.

30:20.320 --> 30:24.280
He also has a liking for fancy foods,
expensive clothes and the nightlife.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.600
Let's not be strangers. I'm Eric.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.840
The real name is Heymar Reinhardt.

31:47.960 --> 31:50.240
Born Frankfurt, Germany, 1946...

31:50.360 --> 31:53.840
educated Paris and
Patrice Lumumba University, Moscow.

31:54.320 --> 31:58.800
Currently financed by... no one.
Since the London incidents...

31:58.920 --> 32:02.320
he has become persona non grata
with revolutionary communities.

32:02.440 --> 32:05.400
What makes him dangerous
is that he wants to prove himself...

32:05.520 --> 32:07.760
as invincible as he ever was.

32:07.880 --> 32:11.680
Well, not to us, of course, but
to international terrorist networks.

32:11.800 --> 32:15.160
So he may strike anywhere,
without warning.

32:15.280 --> 32:19.560
What he wants most is press coverage.
The media is their voice.

32:20.800 --> 32:24.080
ABC... Television, right?

32:24.200 --> 32:26.920
Right. And CBS is down there.

32:27.040 --> 32:29.600
Radio City is way on down there.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.880
The news is here.

32:33.440 --> 32:36.800
You know...
I never asked you what you do.

32:37.720 --> 32:41.680
Well, besides dance a lot,
I fly for National.

32:42.480 --> 32:44.440
"I'm Pam. Fly me."

32:45.760 --> 32:48.320
That's an airline joke, sort of.

32:48.440 --> 32:52.320
Don't get me wrong. I don't actually
fly the plane. I'm just a stewardess.

32:52.440 --> 32:57.320
A flying waitress, some people call us,
but I'd rather dance than do any of that.

32:57.440 --> 32:59.600
- How about you?
- Me?

32:59.720 --> 33:04.040
I'm an international terrorist,
wanted by half the countries in Europe.

33:04.160 --> 33:06.600
- And I'm a lady-killer.
- Sure!

33:08.280 --> 33:11.240
If you allow him to
dictate the circumstances...

33:11.360 --> 33:14.000
the hostages will ultimately die.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.440
You can count on that.

33:16.560 --> 33:20.520
So, try to stay with me, everybody.
Time is short.

33:21.640 --> 33:23.560
Very short.

33:23.680 --> 33:27.880
- Something to add, DaSilva?
- We can't catch him if we sit in here.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.840
It's a logical procedure.

33:29.960 --> 33:33.280
When you have been exposed
to counterterrorist techniques...

33:33.400 --> 33:35.840
then you will be ready for the streets.

33:36.720 --> 33:39.080
A more logical procedure.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.400
He has no network, no real organization.

34:36.520 --> 34:41.000
He improvises. But he manages
to succeed where others have failed.

34:41.120 --> 34:45.480
If he has changed his face,
he will be more dangerous than ever.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.080
Jetzt!

35:48.480 --> 35:53.400
And the destruction of several buildings
in your so-called financial center...

35:53.520 --> 35:55.480
is only a warning.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.960
Wulfgar will strike next
in the international community.

36:00.880 --> 36:03.680
You people are never prepared.

36:03.800 --> 36:06.160
And there's no security.

36:07.840 --> 36:10.200
You may print that.

36:21.440 --> 36:24.480
- You ever see anything like this?
- No.

36:24.600 --> 36:29.560
This detonator tells me that
our suspect is not retired, Sergeant Fox.

36:30.760 --> 36:34.200
Why now? Why not during the day,
when the place is wall-to-wall people?

36:34.320 --> 36:37.040
- It's his method.
- What method?

36:37.160 --> 36:42.280
The instilling of fear. By tomorrow, the UN
delegates will be screaming for protection.

36:42.400 --> 36:45.360
It's all part of the acts
of terror, gentlemen.

36:49.760 --> 36:51.400
Shakka Holland.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.080
OPEC raid, Vienna.

36:54.840 --> 36:55.960
And?

36:57.400 --> 37:01.040
- And what?
- What did she do in the OPEC raid?

37:03.920 --> 37:05.880
OK, once again.

37:06.440 --> 37:09.240
She shot a policeman in the neck
at point-blank range.

37:09.360 --> 37:13.520
She kills without provocation.
She's a known associate of Wulfgar's.

37:13.640 --> 37:15.320
DaSilva...

37:15.440 --> 37:19.680
name the three successful
antiterrorist raids recorded worldwide.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.720
We've gone over this for days now.

37:21.840 --> 37:25.280
And we'll go over it
until it's second nature.

37:26.080 --> 37:31.160
You have to learn to think like him, to
act with the same ruthlessness he does.

37:31.280 --> 37:33.200
Isn't this overkill?

37:34.800 --> 37:36.160
Overkill?

37:36.280 --> 37:40.000
His cover's always some woman who's
clean. He loses one, he finds another.

37:40.120 --> 37:43.840
We know his MO, but what we don't know,
and we'll never know it sitting here...

37:43.960 --> 37:49.720
- is motive, method and opportunity.
- Forget this police-academy nonsense!

37:50.440 --> 37:53.000
This is a terrorist.

37:54.160 --> 37:56.880
He doesn't think like a criminal.
He wants to be a hero.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.840
And you want to treat him
like some mugger on the streets?

37:59.960 --> 38:03.840
- Get inside the man's head, dammit!
- Look, I understand that.

38:03.960 --> 38:07.560
But how do you expect me to understand
you're training us to be assassins?

38:07.680 --> 38:10.560
The only difference between
him and us will be the badge.

38:10.680 --> 38:14.240
I don't know about you, and I don't know
about the rest of these men, but...

38:14.400 --> 38:18.640
- I didn't join the force to kill people.
- For Christ's sake, man!

38:18.760 --> 38:21.880
To combat violence
you need greater violence.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.400
To defeat a violent people,
you have to react in a given situation...

38:25.520 --> 38:27.920
with ruthless,
cold-blooded violence as well.

38:28.040 --> 38:33.720
And if any of you think that you don't
have the killer instinct, you're wrong.

38:33.840 --> 38:38.600
We all have it. It's just a question
of pushing the right button.

38:38.720 --> 38:44.400
And if we're very lucky, there will be
one moment when he will be vulnerable.

38:44.960 --> 38:48.040
One brief, critical moment.

38:49.360 --> 38:51.680
- That is when you must do it.
- Do what?

38:52.280 --> 38:54.200
- Take him.
- You mean open fire?

38:55.520 --> 38:57.880
There's no other way.

38:59.560 --> 39:02.120
And if we miss, that's dead hostages.

39:02.240 --> 39:05.600
- Hopefully not.
- That's an unacceptable risk.

39:08.840 --> 39:12.440
There's a UN benefit at
the Metropolitan Museum next week.

39:12.840 --> 39:17.800
Those people are already hostages. It's
our responsibility to try and stop him.

39:17.920 --> 39:21.040
It's not my responsibility to be
part of an accidental homicide.

39:21.160 --> 39:23.400
For Christ's sake, DaSilva!

39:23.520 --> 39:26.720
Will you get out of this
cop-on-the-beat mentality!

39:26.840 --> 39:30.000
Your wife left you for it!
Wasn't that enough?

39:47.760 --> 39:49.800
And how did I know that, DaSilva?

39:49.920 --> 39:53.080
I make it my business to know
the backgrounds of all you people...

39:53.200 --> 39:59.040
because they're weapons against you. I
knew it would get through to you, DaSilva.

40:00.720 --> 40:03.960
And if there's any way,
Wulfgar will know it too.

40:04.080 --> 40:07.160
He will know the backgrounds
of each of you people.

40:07.280 --> 40:11.040
What's valuable to you.
Make you live in fear.

40:12.120 --> 40:16.680
You people have no idea of the extent of
the underground in your own city, do you?

40:16.800 --> 40:19.280
That's the technique of terror.

40:19.920 --> 40:21.880
How do you like it?

40:24.280 --> 40:26.240
I'm out.

40:30.520 --> 40:32.800
Thank you, everyone. That'll be all.

40:32.920 --> 40:36.240
- Just listen to me...
- I don't want any part of it any more.

40:36.360 --> 40:37.960
I know, but listen...

40:38.080 --> 40:40.880
- He didn't have to say about my wife...
- Listen, listen.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.640
He's asking us to commit ourselves
to stopping a terrorist...

40:44.760 --> 40:49.960
who's capable of wiping out hundreds
of people in one shot, just like that.

40:50.080 --> 40:54.000
You're one of the best.
He's looking at you as one of the best.

40:54.120 --> 40:58.320
And you can't back off now.
You gotta stay with it.

41:00.080 --> 41:02.760
Think about it, OK? It's up to you.

41:46.320 --> 41:48.280
What's this?

41:56.240 --> 41:58.200
Shit.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.800
Jesus.

42:31.320 --> 42:33.720
Let me help you.

42:33.840 --> 42:35.720
I didn't mean it.

42:35.840 --> 42:38.280
I couldn't help wondering...
what was in there.

42:38.400 --> 42:40.360
I know.

42:42.840 --> 42:45.400
- It doesn't matter.
- No...

42:45.520 --> 42:49.680
- Please, I won't tell anyone. Don't worry.
- It's OK.

42:51.840 --> 42:54.200
You mustn't be worried.

42:57.240 --> 42:59.600
You go to a better life.

43:13.640 --> 43:15.880
I don't want that transfer.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.600
- No?
- But I'll be honest with you.

43:19.200 --> 43:23.560
I don't know if I could take
that shot with innocent people around.

43:32.040 --> 43:36.040
"Deke DaSilva, drafted into the army,
August 41969."

43:36.160 --> 43:38.360
"Volunteered for Airborne School."

43:38.480 --> 43:41.160
"Accepted by Officer's Candidate School."

43:41.280 --> 43:44.720
"Reassigned, first lieutenant,
First Cavalry Division, Vietnam."

43:44.840 --> 43:46.720
And much more.

43:46.840 --> 43:49.800
The most interesting statistic is...

43:49.920 --> 43:54.920
52 registered kills in combat service.

43:58.320 --> 44:03.840
One would have said that you were quite
adept at pulling the trigger, wouldn't one?

44:06.120 --> 44:07.480
That was war.

44:09.800 --> 44:15.640
Let me just say that I have a feeling you'll
do the right thing at the right time.

44:21.320 --> 44:23.400
Good evening, DaSilva.

44:47.200 --> 44:50.400
- No hace nada.
- Hay que botarlo, porque no sirve.

44:50.520 --> 44:53.880
- Carajo.
- Carajo. Te veo. Ya te lo apunto, ya.

44:55.480 --> 44:57.760
I'll have the special Cuban melon.

44:57.880 --> 45:00.320
Don't sell melon here.

45:00.440 --> 45:02.880
Didn't I read your ad
in the personal column?

45:03.000 --> 45:05.160
Carajo, yo no advertise.

45:08.160 --> 45:09.960
Maybe Wulfgar was wrong.

45:11.840 --> 45:13.400
Wulfgar.

45:18.720 --> 45:20.600
- Yes?
- They found a stewardess dead.

45:20.720 --> 45:21.760
What stewardess?

45:21.880 --> 45:26.720
If you guys at the command center haven't
heard of this girl, maybe it's time you did.

45:26.840 --> 45:30.960
We're not sure who her boyfriend was,
but we've gone through her souvenirs.

45:31.080 --> 45:34.120
It's like a map of every discotheque
and singles bar in town.

45:34.240 --> 45:36.760
- What's that to do with us?
- No, nothin' unusual...

45:36.880 --> 45:39.640
except one thing that doesn't belong.

45:40.440 --> 45:44.360
A map of the Wall Street area.
The street that was bombed was circled.

45:44.840 --> 45:47.800
I want you and Fox to hit all the places
she might've hung out.

45:47.920 --> 45:51.200
- Somebody might have a bead on her.
- All right, we're on it.

46:01.360 --> 46:03.160
- I never saw her.
- Are you sure?

46:03.280 --> 46:05.000
- Positive.
- Absolutely positive?

46:05.120 --> 46:09.080
- I never saw her.
- If you hear of anything, give us a call.

46:16.720 --> 46:18.880
- No?
- Maybe, maybe.

46:20.040 --> 46:21.400
If you think of anything...

46:21.520 --> 46:25.280
- Ever seen that girl around here?
- No, I don't think so.

46:26.080 --> 46:30.360
Look, if you remember anything,
call me at that number, all right?

46:42.480 --> 46:44.560
No, no. Never seen her before.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Why don't you look again?

46:49.120 --> 46:51.200
Don't remember her. Do you?

46:53.160 --> 46:55.160
Yeah, she's been here.

46:55.280 --> 46:57.080
When?

46:57.200 --> 47:00.320
- Maybe a couple of weeks ago.
- Do you remember who she was with?

47:00.440 --> 47:04.040
Yeah, a guy with blond hair,
dressed pretty good.

47:04.160 --> 47:06.960
- Has he been here tonight?
- I ain't seen him.

47:07.080 --> 47:09.520
We just wanna
look around a while, all right?

47:09.640 --> 47:12.840
OK. Go with him, Mike.
Don't hassle anyone, OK?

47:12.960 --> 47:15.520
- May I have your coats?
- Thank you.

47:55.200 --> 47:56.960
This way.

49:23.440 --> 49:26.680
- What do you think?
- I don't think he's here.

49:27.400 --> 49:30.320
We're gonna stick around for a while.

49:30.440 --> 49:32.000
All right.

50:14.200 --> 50:17.200
Come on, Deke.
Why don't we check out another place?

50:17.320 --> 50:19.280
Wait. Wait.

50:21.480 --> 50:22.560
What?

50:23.160 --> 50:27.120
Let's say I did this...
Cut this off, added this.

50:28.880 --> 50:31.600
He could look something like that,
couldn't he?

50:31.720 --> 50:33.600
Yeah, I guess so. Why?

50:33.720 --> 50:37.360
Because that... is standing over there.

50:44.040 --> 50:47.400
- I got a feeling.
- You wanna go check him out?

52:12.840 --> 52:14.280
Wulfgar!

52:48.240 --> 52:50.680
Police! Move! Move!

52:58.280 --> 53:01.040
You dumb jerk!
You wanna get killed?!

53:15.840 --> 53:17.800
I'll go this way!

53:31.000 --> 53:33.440
- He went that way.
- In here!

54:46.320 --> 54:49.640
- That's seven. He should be out.
- I hope you're right!

54:52.440 --> 54:54.200
Now!

54:59.040 --> 55:00.800
Dammit!

55:11.440 --> 55:13.520
Police! Move! Get outta the way!

55:18.240 --> 55:20.800
Get outta the way! Move!

55:21.320 --> 55:22.880
You got him?

55:23.000 --> 55:25.960
I don't see him!

55:32.040 --> 55:33.280
I got him!

55:33.400 --> 55:35.520
I lost him!

55:37.440 --> 55:39.040
I got him! I got him!

55:39.800 --> 55:41.960
Scream!

55:46.200 --> 55:48.680
Stand away! Move!

55:48.800 --> 55:51.080
- Get outta the way!
- Shoot!

55:52.400 --> 55:54.160
Shoot!

55:56.400 --> 55:58.440
Idiot! Take the shot!

55:59.240 --> 56:01.200
He's not clear.

56:02.320 --> 56:04.080
Dammit!

56:33.760 --> 56:35.520
Move!

56:43.560 --> 56:45.520
Jump, Deke, jump!

56:55.520 --> 56:57.480
Come on, I got you.

57:00.080 --> 57:03.280
- It's locked.
- Get back. I'm gonna kick it open.

57:11.160 --> 57:12.920
Police!

57:19.040 --> 57:20.880
Police! Get back!

57:21.000 --> 57:23.800
Get outta the way! Stand back!

57:34.920 --> 57:36.880
Are you all right?

57:46.040 --> 57:48.800
- Police!
- Move! Get outta the way!

57:48.920 --> 57:50.880
Come on, goddamnit!

58:02.080 --> 58:04.040
Get back! Move!

58:19.320 --> 58:21.080
Move!

58:28.240 --> 58:30.200
- I got him this way!
- Watch out.

58:41.320 --> 58:43.040
Goddamnit!

58:43.920 --> 58:45.880
Fox!

58:46.520 --> 58:49.040
Deke! Deke!

58:49.160 --> 58:50.960
Don't move. Jesus Christ!

58:51.080 --> 58:53.720
- God, I'm hurt.
- Get on back, goddamnit!

58:53.840 --> 58:56.000
Get some help!
I'll kill that son of a bitch.

58:56.120 --> 58:58.120
- Get him!
- Don't move.

58:58.240 --> 59:00.680
- Get him, Deke!
- I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

59:00.800 --> 59:03.120
- Get him!
- Don't move. You're fuckin' dead!

59:03.240 --> 59:06.600
I'll kill that motherfucker.
You're fuckin' dead!

59:06.720 --> 59:08.560
You're fuckin' dead!

59:08.680 --> 59:13.440
I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.
You're fuckin' dead, you motherfucker!

59:14.440 --> 59:16.600
You're fuckin' dead!

59:33.320 --> 59:35.280
How you doin'?

59:36.760 --> 59:39.160
The doctor said you have great reflexes.

59:39.280 --> 59:44.800
You caught that blade on the jawbone,
so it didn't touch anything vital.

59:44.920 --> 59:47.720
Before you know it,
you'll be back at the command center.

59:47.840 --> 59:49.800
OK? Good as new?

59:51.000 --> 59:52.960
- Deke...
- What?

59:56.960 --> 59:59.200
You shoulda took that shot.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.520
You shoulda took the shot.

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.480
Close the shop.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.600
Wulfgar.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.440
The police have
a description of you, Wulfgar.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.080
And by now, every delegation
at the UN has it too.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.800
It doesn't matter.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:11.200
I was wondering
when you would come here.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:13.000
Have you seen Hammad?

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:16.760
Hammad is beginning to pay attention.
He's not ready to take you back yet.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.840
Soon he'll beg.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.920
How did they trace me so soon?
I don't understand.

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:29.000
- You must know...
- What?

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.080
Hartman.

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:36.120
- Hartman? Here?
- Yes.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.080
You're just in time.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:45.200
I need all the information
you can get on the UN personnel.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.280
Hartman's people, too.

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:53.160
Especially the name of the bastard
who chased me tonight.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.720
Have you been all right?

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.960
Well, yeah, fine. Why?

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.960
I want you to be
a bit more careful, that's all.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:05.680
- You still haven't told me why.
- Irene, do me a favor this one time.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:09.400
- Don't meet any new people right now.
- I wanna know why.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.040
Why can't you just
do what I say one time?

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:16.120
You haven't talked like this before.
What are you working on?

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.280
If you'd like to talk about it,
I'd be happy to listen.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:23.080
No, it'd take too long to explain.
It's too complicated to go into now.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:26.680
- We'll talk later.
- Well, all right. How about this?

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:31.120
Why don't we have dinner
together next weekend?

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.600
At your favorite little Italian restaurant?

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.840
Did I say something that brought that on?

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.600
Maybe.

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:40.840
- Are you serious?
- Absolutely.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.960
Well, how about I make the reservations?
I'll call you on Friday.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.040
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.320
Is this all?

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.360
Yes.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:47.320
Then we're ready.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:37.440
The French assistant
ambassador's leaving.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.360
OK, good. How are you feelin'?

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:46.000
I love watching other people
have a good time.

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:56.840
Gentlemen, proceed with
your checkpoints, please.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:01.240
And let the guests see you.
Keeps them from getting nervous.

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.440
Checkpoint one all clear.
Checkpoint two?

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.440
South wing is all clear.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.280
I've got the Swedish delegate in here.

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:15.520
- TV, check in, please.
- Pretty pictures here.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:19.240
- Elevator, check in, please.
- British ambassador's on his way.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.880
North side, check in.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.800
- Everything's OK here.
- Roger.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.680
DaSilva, everything seems to be
under control up there.

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.960
- Would you take Zone A?
- Sure. Listen...

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.440
- Are you hungry?
- A bit.

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:36.520
- Chinese food later?
- Look forward to it.

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.320
- How's everything?
- Fine.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.400
Hartman, proceeding
to the south escalator.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:52.200
Hello, balcony?
German counsel's heading your way.

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.320
OK, I see him.

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:56.400
DaSilva, do you read me?

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.520
Checkpoint one.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.800
DaSilva, by the way...
Who's picking up the check?

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:05.000
Well, I believe in age
before beauty, don't you?

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.920
Shakka.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:32.240
Watch out! Move outta the way! Get back!

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.320
Don't turn him over!

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.760
Shit.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.640
- All right, we got all the exits covered.
- Forget it.

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.960
- What do you mean?
- She's gone. Forget it.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:47.240
- It's not his big play, anyway.
- How do you know?

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:52.760
Because I'm beginning to know
how the son of a bitch thinks.

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.320
Punch these up quick, all right?

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.640
Unexpected stop.

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:52.120
This is Shakka.

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.280
Do not underestimate her
because she's a woman.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:58.080
She has no maternal instincts.

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:01.040
Don't be so afraid.
Back up, against the window!

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.680
I like your hat.

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.360
I'll be talking to you.
How old is that child?

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.720
- He's just eight months.
- OK.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:12.200
- Comment ça va?
- Bonjour.

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.680
- Du نr svensk?
- Ja.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:25.120
- This is Wulfgar calling.
- Get me 911, please.

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:30.000
There are certain representatives
of the United Nations with me.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:34.399
I'll announce my terms for their release...

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:37.680
when the proper authorities
are present to hear them.

01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:40.359
I got it.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.080
Right.

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:45.279
DaSilva, Fox. Wulfgar's on the tram.

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:53.760
Please.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.399
I'm aware of every trick.

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:58.680
Do not force me to prove it.

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.000
Thank you.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.479
Now... we'll get better acquainted.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.880
Let's go!

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:30.120
- You have three children, right?
- How do you know that?

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.800
All the lines are open.

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:19.760
Detective Munafo, Sergeant Fox.
Gimme your binoculars.

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.680
Take it over the bridge.

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.640
Face the windows, everybody! Quickly!

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.640
- Can you see him?
- Yes, I see him.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.040
Shakka's with him
and he has about 25 hostages.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:03.560
He's doing something at
the back of the car. Wait a minute.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.560
Your husband is first assistant to
the French ambassador, is he not?

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.360
Please... leave us alone.
We've done nothing.

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.840
You must be very proud.
You will come over...

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:15.200
- No, you take me!
- Sh.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.960
What is it? What is happening?

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:20.040
Life, Mr Marigny.

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:23.360
No... it's not...

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:27.720
He's taken a woman to the front
of the tram. He has her against a window.

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.720
- What the hell is he doing?
- He's making the rules.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:34.080
Get a little closer. I wanna see his face.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.200
This one's for you, DaSilva.

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:44.760
Christ. Don't do it.

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:50.920
- Goddamnit, Matt, he killed her.
- I requested no police.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.920
Get rid of the body.

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:18.480
This is Wulfgar calling.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.960
Yes, we hear you.
This is Sergeant Fox.

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:27.040
If the UN authorities are present,
I'm ready to proceed.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:31.480
I've been instructed to ask if you would
release all non-political hostages.

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.440
You are wasting your time.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:38.080
- As you see, I am not to be taken lightly.
- We hear you.

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.240
Before we go any further...
there's an infant here.

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:44.400
I want it taken off.

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:48.440
I don't want the press to write
that I'm a man without a conscience.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:52.920
- All right, what do you want?
- In five minutes, I'll lower a cable.

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:58.320
If you want the infant alive...
you'd better hurry.

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:01.320
- I'll be ready.
- Not you, Fox!

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.800
I want that bastard!

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.040
What bastard?

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:07.920
Me.

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:20.960
You can't let him go up there.
He'll waste him!

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:24.600
Look, I'm in charge here, Fox!
DaSilva's the man.

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:10.480
The barge is nearly in place.

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.880
How do you feel?

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.600
Helpless?

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:20.280
I could have cut the cable.
It's a long way down.

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:25.720
- Why'd you kill the woman?
- I wanted to.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:28.160
So why don't you kill me?

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.560
In due time.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:37.160
I want you to tell 'em
I have brought the city to its knees.

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:40.120
Police... are cowards.

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:42.080
What?

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.080
I said... tell 'em.

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:53.320
He's brought the city to its knees.

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.920
The police are cowards.

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.200
We're not that different, Deke.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:10.440
I do not enjoy killing, but it's my job.
Someone has to do it.

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:15.120
I represent... oppressed victims
who have nothing.

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:18.720
I speak only for them. I'm their voice.

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.640
I'm a liberator.

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:24.200
You think you're a liberator?

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:28.280
It's fascinating. Yes.

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.840
- The child!
- No! No!

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.760
Come on. Come on!

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:40.280
- Give it to me!
- Please be careful with him.

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:52.240
Sit down.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.120
This is for the press.

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.640
- Now, you may drop the child...
- Oh, no!

01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:00.800
- Don't drop this.
- He'll be all right.

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.800
What if you don't win this time?

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.560
Try again.

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:08.960
Shakka, lower him.

01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:11.520
Please be careful with him!

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.680
Deke, you must realize...

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.120
we're not heroes, we're victims.

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.480
This is Wulfgar.

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.400
- Go ahead.
- These are my demands.

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:42.560
I gave DaSilva a declaration...

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:45.640
to be published in
The Times and The Washington Post...

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.600
and read over all networks.

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.720
- We don't control the press.
- No excuses!

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:54.960
I want a jet and a bus to the airport
by ten o'clock tonight.

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.560
And no police.

01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.240
The following comrades...

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:02.240
are to be released before ten o'clock.

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:05.440
Mohammed Yafi, Rafael Saldaٌa...

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:09.120
Miroslav Jakovic, Liu Chan Tao.

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:14.720
- May we have until morning?
- Ten o'clock sharp.

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.680
And DaSilva... will drive the bus.

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:31.720
We may not make it this time.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:36.560
It does not matter.

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:47.040
Let me have the cassette recording
of Hartman's last lecture on Shakka...

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:52.600
the smallest tape recorder you can find,
ten feet of wire and an activator button.

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.520
Shakka Holland,
alias Shakka Kapoor...

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:37.320
The drama has not seen
a change for the better or worse.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:42.800
The hostages still remain over 250 feet
above the East River in a cable car.

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.920
Several hours ago an innocent woman
was sent to her death...

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:50.440
by that terrorist known only as Wulfgar
and a single female companion.

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:52.760
Moments after that savage killing...

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:56.000
that same terrorist demanded
an infant be taken to safety.

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:57.720
For those who tuned in late...

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:06.800
- You sure you know what you're doing?
- I think so.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:10.040
You know when that bus gets to
the airport he's gonna waste you.

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:12.760
Why are you always tryin' to cheer me up?

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:15.720
- You said before, it's my choice.
- I did say that, didn't I?

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.600
- I'll see you later.
- I'll be watching.

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.480
I'm coming in.

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.360
No talking.

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:58.160
Move! Come on!

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.480
Move!

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.840
Move!

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:31.680
Soon it is your time.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:35.120
Come on! Hurry up! Quick!

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:44.160
Shakka Holland,
alias Shakka Kapoor...

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:48.720
born February 91949, Tangiers, Morocco,
of wealthy parents.

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:51.720
A spoilt bitch
who kills without provocation.

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:53.000
You shit!

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:57.600
Get down!

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:01.480
Deke! Deke!

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.040
They found an address on Shakka.

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:13.120
Where the hell is he?

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:15.200
I don't know. Come on.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.360
Don't stop. Keep moving.

01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:44.840
I don't care what you think.
He might still have keys to the apartment.

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:47.080
Anybody comes or goes,
you check it out.

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.040
We haven't found a body,
but we got everything covered.

01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:00.920
Well, keep looking.
He probably left something behind.

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:06.000
- What is it?
- Wait a minute.

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:16.000
Christ!

01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:08.360
Evening, ma'am. Chilly, isn't it?
