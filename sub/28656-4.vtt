ELEMENTARY #704
"Red Light, Green Light"
Closed captioned

00:00.542 --> 00:02.294
Previously on Elementary...

00:02.294 --> 00:03.670
BELL (on phone):
The captain, he’s been shot.

00:03.670 --> 00:05.255
I came straight
from the airport.

00:05.255 --> 00:06.548
So that’s Captain Dwyer.

00:06.548 --> 00:08.133
BELL:
He’s gonna cover both squads,

00:08.133 --> 00:09.927
until we know more about
Captain Gregson.

00:09.927 --> 00:11.553
(crying):
My name is Carmen Zelaya.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.972
That video was given
to her brother, Halcon Zelaya,

00:13.972 --> 00:15.724
the man who runs Mara Tres.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.184
What do you want?

00:17.184 --> 00:18.936
I know who killed your sister.

00:18.936 --> 00:21.355
You can call me Patrick. It’s
not Lieutenant Meers, anymore.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.565
I left the army last year.
I did it.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.567
I didn’t really want to shoot
that cop, the captain...

00:25.567 --> 00:28.612
I didn’t want to,
but he figured it out.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.530
He never wavered from his story,
and there’s no way to prove

00:30.530 --> 00:33.158
that he knew about Tim Bledsoe’s
plan to blow up the ferry.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.160
HOLMES:
Patrick Meers
was not acting alone.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.121
Someone or some group
were pulling his strings.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.331
Is the captain
doing any better?

00:39.331 --> 00:41.375
Still hasn’t regained
consciousness.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.709
The docs think
there may be something

00:42.709 --> 00:44.127
in there still bleeding.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.923
(birds chirping)

01:04.815 --> 01:07.609
DWYER: He was
a hell of a guy.

01:07.609 --> 01:11.363
I-I know you were close,
you and Tommy.

01:11.363 --> 01:15.534
You didn’t just lose your
captain, you lost your friend.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.119
But I want you to know
that as long

01:17.119 --> 01:18.829
as I’m the boss at the 11th,

01:18.829 --> 01:20.414
you and your partner
will always have a home to go...

01:20.414 --> 01:22.708
Stop.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.251
Stop what?

01:24.251 --> 01:26.878
Talking. You’re annoying me.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.714
I’m trying to do right
by you here.

01:28.714 --> 01:29.840
No.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.133
You’re not real.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.135
None of this is real.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.470
I’ve had this dream before.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.306
Usually, it’s Watson
who approaches me,

01:37.306 --> 01:38.974
sometimes it’s Marcus.

01:38.974 --> 01:42.728
One time, it was a
scary clown with an axe.

01:42.728 --> 01:45.564
It’s your first appearance.

01:45.564 --> 01:47.524
Presumably, because you
and I met in reality

01:47.524 --> 01:51.278
for the first time
just a few hours ago.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.280
I’m disappointed, really.

01:53.280 --> 01:57.284
I mean, not in you, but in
myself, in my subconscious.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.536
(chuckles) You’d think
it could find new ways

01:59.536 --> 02:03.040
to express my concern
for my friend.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.834
You think this is a dream?

02:05.834 --> 02:07.586
Yeah, I’m asleep at home.

02:07.586 --> 02:11.465
And the captain’s
still in hospital.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.216
And what about
the scary clown with the axe?

02:13.216 --> 02:16.094
He go back
to the murder-circus?

02:16.094 --> 02:18.388
Know what?
I take it back.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.890
You and your partner
aren’t welcome at the 11th.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.308
You’re nuts.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.981
(machine whirring)

02:34.029 --> 02:35.947
(sighs)

02:44.873 --> 02:46.541
(elevator bell dings)

02:54.466 --> 02:55.801
You got here fast.

02:55.801 --> 02:58.470
You said he wanted to see me?

02:58.470 --> 03:00.472
Paige said that he asked
for both us when he woke up.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.099
She’s here?
Downstairs.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.683
She hadn’t eaten,

03:03.683 --> 03:06.812
so I said I’d sit with him
until she got back.

03:06.812 --> 03:10.357
So he already said everything
he wanted to say to me.

03:10.357 --> 03:13.026
It’s your turn.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.782
(knocking on door)

03:18.782 --> 03:20.575
Hey.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.164
Good to see you.

03:26.164 --> 03:30.961
Joan said you squared everything
with the Feds.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.130
No one’s gonna take you
out of here in cuffs.

03:33.130 --> 03:36.049
My days as a
fugitive are over.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.386
Paige told me
you came to see me.

03:39.386 --> 03:42.431
I don’t know
what you said,

03:42.431 --> 03:45.642
but, uh, I appreciate
you not pulling the plug.

03:45.642 --> 03:49.855
(chuckles) Well, it was,
it was good to see you.

03:49.855 --> 03:52.983
It’s, uh... put everything
in perspective.

03:52.983 --> 03:56.862
I’ve got perspective
to spare today.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.742
I wanted you to know that...

04:02.742 --> 04:05.078
before all this happened,
I was gonna call you.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.164
It’s over.

04:07.164 --> 04:10.625
The unfortunate business between
us, that’s in the past now.

04:12.752 --> 04:17.132
A day like today?
I’d prefer to look forward.

04:17.132 --> 04:20.927
I’d like that, too.

04:30.562 --> 04:33.190

No. You can’t.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.908

Oh, stop.

What the...? What was that?

05:00.509 --> 05:02.552
Hold her, please.
And call 911.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.224
Hey, are you okay?

05:07.224 --> 05:07.974
Yeah, I’m good.
I’m good. I’m good.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.739
Hey, I’m a nurse.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.115
Um, your friend needs
medical attention.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.076
Can you help me?

05:26.076 --> 05:28.495
I need help opening this door.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.038
Hey! I said I need hel...

05:30.038 --> 05:32.832
(explosion)

06:06.700 --> 06:07.993
(indistinct chatter)

06:07.993 --> 06:09.703
(indistinct conversation)

06:16.835 --> 06:20.463
Bomb squad says it looks
like the van was a VBIED,

06:20.463 --> 06:22.966
or a "Vehicle Borne
Improvised Explosive Device."

06:22.966 --> 06:24.634
They’re still checking
the wreckage,

06:24.634 --> 06:26.469
but they think
the explosive was gasoline,

06:26.469 --> 06:29.806
a few hundred gallons
hidden in the back.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.392
You said that two people
were killed, huh?

06:32.392 --> 06:35.395
The driver of the van and
a woman who was trying to help.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.481
According to one of her friends,
the truck had the green light,

06:38.481 --> 06:40.191
the van blew through
the intersection

06:40.191 --> 06:42.068
and T-boned
the tractor trailer.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.154
The van’s driver
was stuck behind the wheel,

06:44.154 --> 06:46.072
but his passenger
was able to get out.

06:46.072 --> 06:49.993
He ran, and then boom.

06:49.993 --> 06:52.746
So, either the bomb
went off accidentally,

06:52.746 --> 06:55.040
or the passenger
triggered it as he ran.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.625
No way of knowing what their
final destination was,

06:56.625 --> 06:58.585
but this is New York.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.462
It’s not like we’re short on
places to blow up.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.380
I would’ve reached out to you
and Sherlock either way,

07:02.380 --> 07:05.717
but after everything we went
through with Patrick Meers...

07:05.717 --> 07:07.093
What, you think
this is connected?

07:07.093 --> 07:08.678
You were the ones
who thought him

07:08.678 --> 07:10.930
and Tim Bledsoe might be part
of some terror cell.

07:10.930 --> 07:14.267
Well, Bledsoe used fertilizer
in his device, not gasoline.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.727
But it was still a car bomb.

07:15.727 --> 07:18.104
Meanwhile, the friend of
the woman who died said

07:18.104 --> 07:21.024
the passenger had dark hair
and a dark complexion.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.942
That got the Feds thinking
al-Qaeda or ISIS.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.904
If it’s one of those groups,

07:25.904 --> 07:27.572
they like to carry out
multiple attacks.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.741
That could mean there are
more car bombs out there.

07:29.741 --> 07:32.577
You said Sherlock
was here already?

07:35.497 --> 07:37.499
Is that the driver?

07:37.499 --> 07:40.085
Yeah. What’s left of him.

07:40.085 --> 07:42.003
Despite the description
you were given,

07:42.003 --> 07:43.296
I can virtually guarantee you
this man is not

07:43.296 --> 07:44.798
a member of al-Qaeda or ISIS.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.217
I’m listening.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.802
Look at the belt buckle.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.721
Despite the charring,
you can quite clearly see

07:51.721 --> 07:54.182
it’s a white cross
on a field of blue.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.810
What kind of Islamic extremist
wears a cross on his way

07:56.810 --> 07:58.770
to blowing himself up
for the cause?

07:58.770 --> 07:59.813
HOLMES: Furthermore,
while it might be

07:59.813 --> 08:02.023
from the 19th-century
flag of Greece,

08:02.023 --> 08:05.026
it is more likely the insignia
of La Libertad,

08:05.026 --> 08:07.445
a departamento
of El Salvador.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.155
You said the witness
you spoke to described

08:09.155 --> 08:11.282
seeing dark smudges
on the face of the man who ran.

08:11.282 --> 08:14.661
Yeah. She thought it was grease
or something, from the crash.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.247
Yeah, what if it wasn’t grease?
What if it was tattoos?

08:17.247 --> 08:20.291
El Salvador, facial tattoos,
so you think this guy

08:20.291 --> 08:22.627
and his friend were members
of Mara Tres.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.296
HOLMES:
While it is possible two members
of a vicious street gang

08:25.296 --> 08:28.174
were co-opted by terrorists,
it’s more likely

08:28.174 --> 08:30.468
the bomb they were carrying
was intended for a rival group.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.137
That makes sense.

08:32.137 --> 08:33.555
I mean, the last time
we dealt with Mara Tres,

08:33.555 --> 08:35.056
they massacred a bunch
of SBK members.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.266
They like to go big.

08:36.266 --> 08:38.893
I’ll talk to Captain Dwyer
and the Feds.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.645
Tell them it’s something
we need to consider.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.942
So I know the FBI doesn’t want
to arrest us anymore,

08:45.942 --> 08:47.944
but if you’re done here,
I’d rather not linger.

08:47.944 --> 08:51.489
The evidence has spoken, Watson,
and it said "Mara Tres."

08:51.489 --> 08:54.159
The authorities can come at this
any way they want.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.703
You and I have got a man
on the inside.

08:56.703 --> 08:59.122
We do?

08:59.122 --> 09:00.874
Halcon Zelaya?

09:00.874 --> 09:02.167
That’s your man inside.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.585
I realize you’re not a fan.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.170
"Not a fan"?
The guy is responsible

09:05.170 --> 09:06.963
for dozens of murders,
not to mention the fact

09:06.963 --> 09:08.798
that the last time we saw him

09:08.798 --> 09:10.425
he was carting his dead
sister around in a crate.

09:10.425 --> 09:12.051
Well, he was grieving.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.344
And, to be fair,
he didn’t put her in the crate,

09:13.344 --> 09:15.180
her killer did.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.474
Okay. Let’s say
you’re right.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.392
Mara Tres is responsible
for the bomb.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.061
Halcon is their New York boss.
Why would he tell you anything?

09:22.061 --> 09:25.190
Let’s say two of his men really
did become radicalized.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.442
He may be a criminal,
but he lives by a code.

09:27.442 --> 09:30.528
I think he would help us
identify them.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.822
You said it’ s more likely the
bomb was meant for a rival gang.

09:32.822 --> 09:36.117
That would mean he was
the one behind the bomb.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.994
If he was, and he lies to me,
I’ll know it.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.788
Then at least we’ll know
we’re on the right track.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.039
Anyway, he still hasn’t
responded

09:41.039 --> 09:43.208
to any of my messages.
(phone chimes)

09:43.208 --> 09:44.959
He hasn’t got
your number, has he?

09:44.959 --> 09:47.045
It’s the captain.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.630
He says he’s been catching up
on everything that happened

09:48.630 --> 09:50.840
after Patrick Meers shot him.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.926
He wants to talk to us.
Go.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.177
I’ll continue my search
for Halcon without you.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.303
Are you sure?

09:55.303 --> 09:57.222
If I wind up in a crate,

09:57.222 --> 09:58.932
you’ll know I should’ve left
well enough alone.

10:01.476 --> 10:04.062
GREGSON:
Ugh. Thanks for coming.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.898
Of course.
Sherlock would’ve come, too,

10:06.898 --> 10:10.318
but there was an explosion
in Harlem last night.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.445
Yeah. I heard.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.823
I should’ve figured
you two’d be helping out.

10:14.823 --> 10:17.033
It’s okay.
It’s covered.

10:17.033 --> 10:20.662
Think it had anything
to do with this guy?

10:20.662 --> 10:22.080
It crossed our minds,
but no.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.290
It doesn’t look related.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.793
Is that why
you wanted to see us?

10:26.793 --> 10:30.088
(sighs) No. Not exactly.

10:30.088 --> 10:32.674
I had to twist Marcus’s
arm to get this,

10:32.674 --> 10:34.133
but I wanted to find out

10:34.133 --> 10:36.928
how everything went down
after I got shot.

10:36.928 --> 10:39.639
The stuff that you figured out
about Tim Bledsoe?

10:39.639 --> 10:42.267
The bomb he was building?
That was news to me.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.269
I was looking at Meers
for the same reason

10:44.269 --> 10:46.354
Marcus did.
I thought he killed Bledsoe

10:46.354 --> 10:48.648
after they got in a fight
outside a bar.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.234
Well, Meers told me that you
went to see him at his office.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.652
There was a photograph
of a snack bar

10:52.652 --> 10:54.529
that his partner helped build.

10:54.529 --> 10:57.365
You thought that might be where
Bledsoe’s body was hidden,

10:57.365 --> 11:00.243
so you went there, Meers
followed, then he shot you.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.745
He told you this all happened
on the same night,

11:02.745 --> 11:04.455
only it didn’t.

11:04.455 --> 11:07.166
What do you mean?

11:07.166 --> 11:10.128
I went to see Meers
the day before.

11:10.128 --> 11:11.671
And that photo?

11:11.671 --> 11:13.965
If it was on his wall,
I never saw it.

11:13.965 --> 11:15.592
I found it online the next day.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.302
I was doing a search
of Meers’ name,

11:17.302 --> 11:19.012
and it’s one of the images
that came up.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.347
It was part of his
construction company’s website.

11:21.347 --> 11:25.184
That’s... when I went
to the baseball field.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.186
So, more than 24 hours passed

11:27.186 --> 11:29.272
between you talking to Meers,
and him shooting you?

11:29.272 --> 11:32.400
Why would he lie about that?

11:32.400 --> 11:35.403
HALCON:
You brought it, my dogs.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.697
Those punks tried
to take what’s yours,

11:37.697 --> 11:39.699
but you didn’t back down.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.826
You went right at them.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.787
You punished them
for their arrogance.

11:44.787 --> 11:47.248
’Cause that’s how we do, right?

11:47.248 --> 11:50.376
All right, on three,
give me a "bulldogs."

11:50.376 --> 11:52.503
One, two, three.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.088
ALL:
Bulldogs!

11:54.088 --> 11:56.090
All right, Tristan’s mom has
orange slices in her car.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.259
Make sure you put the trash
in the cans.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.178
I don’t want to find no rinds
on the ground.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.055
Hey, you did a great job
today, buddy.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.223
All right, I’m a little proud
of you, all right, mijo?

12:04.223 --> 12:06.601
All right, now go get some
oranges. Go, go, go, go, go!

12:06.601 --> 12:08.353
(indistinct shouting)

12:11.564 --> 12:14.943
You play five up front, three in
the middle and two at the back.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.487
That formation went
out with the plague.

12:17.487 --> 12:21.240
Well, kids this age--
the more players

12:21.240 --> 12:24.535
you got kicking the ball at
the opposing goal, the better.

12:24.535 --> 12:27.413
But I’m betting you’re not here
to talk about soccer.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.625
When I couldn’t contact
you via traditional means,

12:30.625 --> 12:32.627
I reached out to
a street informant.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.629
Imagine my surprise
when they told me

12:34.629 --> 12:36.673
you disappeared
two years ago,

12:36.673 --> 12:38.716
and that Mara Tres has been
under new leadership ever since.

12:41.678 --> 12:44.514
He said there was a rumor that
you managed to buy your way out.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.766
Tell me, Halcon--

12:46.766 --> 12:49.102
did you pay in money or blood?

12:51.562 --> 12:54.107
Halcon’s dead, Holmes.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.109
I’m just Danny now.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.820
I’m a civilian.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.280
After my sister got killed,
you know, I just

13:01.280 --> 13:05.618
couldn’t take it no more,
you know? The life.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.704
So, did what I had to.

13:07.704 --> 13:11.040
I got the right blessings,
disappeared, I married my girl.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.335
I moved her and my son
up here to Connecticut.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.295
It’s nice, right?

13:16.295 --> 13:18.840
I don’t know who
removed your tattoos,

13:18.840 --> 13:20.675
but I’m very impressed.
Yeah.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.552
Wasn’t cheap.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.637
So how’d you find me?

13:24.637 --> 13:26.639
I paid a visit to
your sister’s grave.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.726
It was very well-maintained,
as I expected, and decorated

13:29.726 --> 13:31.769
with fresh flowers.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.980
I went to local florists,

13:33.980 --> 13:36.566
managed to procure the
credit card information

13:36.566 --> 13:39.152
of your new identity,
"Danny Hurtado."

13:39.152 --> 13:41.904
Always thought you were smart.

13:41.904 --> 13:46.951
But a smart man would have let
a sleeping dog like me lie.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.370
So why you here?

13:49.370 --> 13:51.748
You heard about the
explosion in New York?

13:51.748 --> 13:54.333
We think that your former
gang may be responsible.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.919
(laughs) What?

13:56.919 --> 13:59.589
They said on the news
they think it’s terrorists.

13:59.589 --> 14:02.008
Hmm.
My boys are
life-takers, sure,

14:02.008 --> 14:03.801
but terrorists? Come on.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.762
There’s no money in it.

14:05.762 --> 14:08.765
It’s possible the two men
involved were freelancing.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.559
Anyway, I need their names.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.603
Holmes, I told you.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.855
I’m done with Mara Tres.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.066
You left on good terms,

14:18.066 --> 14:20.777
so there must be
someone you can call.

14:20.777 --> 14:24.697
If you’d prefer, I could
call the local authorities

14:24.697 --> 14:26.407
and have a conversation
with them

14:26.407 --> 14:29.660
about Coach Hurtado’s
colorful past.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.287
It’s up to you.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.875
All right.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.044
Bad news is, I was only
able to get you one name.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.838
But the good news is,
I was right.

14:40.838 --> 14:44.425
That van blowing up had nothing
to do with a terrorist attack.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.427
It wasn’t a bomb.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.137
That was a fuel-skimmer.

14:48.137 --> 14:51.390
And the driver--
the one who was killed--

14:51.390 --> 14:53.518
his name was Bosco Jimenez.

14:53.518 --> 14:56.104
The van was tricked out,
had all these big bags,

14:56.104 --> 14:58.064
these bladders,
and he and his partner

14:58.064 --> 14:59.690
would go from gas station
to gas station

14:59.690 --> 15:01.025
using stolen
credit card numbers

15:01.025 --> 15:02.693
and fill up those bladders.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.112
Once they reached
400 or 500 gallons’ worth,

15:04.112 --> 15:05.780
then they would go
to the other stations

15:05.780 --> 15:07.573
and sell it at a discount.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.659
That didn’t happen
last night, did it?
No,

15:09.659 --> 15:12.995
’cause that idiot truck driver
ran a red, Bosco T-boned him.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.956
Who told you
the driver ran a red?

15:14.956 --> 15:17.041
The guy I just called.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.502
He said that the guy who
was with Bosco said it.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.796
Well, the guy who was
with Bosco was lying,

15:21.796 --> 15:23.798
because the truck
had a green light.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.466
Witness to the
crash confirmed it.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.927
No, no, there’s no way.
I knew Bosco, okay?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.971
The guy was a legend.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.722
He was the best wheelman ever.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.474
He drove that van
and ran drugs up

15:33.474 --> 15:35.935
from Mexico, ran point
on dozens of drive-bys,

15:35.935 --> 15:37.645
all without ever getting busted.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.772
No tickets, no accidents,
no nothing.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.190
There’s no way
he would’ve driven a van full

15:41.190 --> 15:42.775
of gasoline through a red light.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.944
Nah, it had to be
the other guy.

15:44.944 --> 15:48.364
Not necessarily.
You calling me a liar?

15:48.364 --> 15:50.366
I’m saying there’s
a possibility

15:50.366 --> 15:52.034
that everyone involved
is telling the truth.

15:52.034 --> 15:55.163
Neither Bosco nor the truck
driver ran a red light,

15:55.163 --> 15:57.165
because they both had greens.

15:57.165 --> 16:00.543
You think the light was broken?

16:00.543 --> 16:02.670
That’s one possibility.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.298
Another possibility is
that it was hijacked.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.719
(phone ringing,
indistinct chatter)

16:19.270 --> 16:20.897
Am I crazy,

16:20.897 --> 16:23.649
or do we have a bunch of Feds
in our conference room?

16:23.649 --> 16:25.735
I see FBI, DEA, ICE.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.653
Yeah, it’s the
Interdepartmental Task Force

16:27.653 --> 16:28.988
assigned to Mara Tres.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.865
Sherlock and Joan asked
me to invite them over

16:30.865 --> 16:32.909
to talk about the
van that blew up.

16:32.909 --> 16:35.286
Do I go in?

16:35.286 --> 16:37.955
You could, but pretty sure they
won’t be in there very long.

16:40.499 --> 16:43.044
So, in other words,
the accident wasn’t an accident?

16:43.044 --> 16:44.420
Someone hacked
the traffic light there

16:44.420 --> 16:46.172
and made the van hit the truck?

16:46.172 --> 16:47.757
In addition to confirming

16:47.757 --> 16:49.884
that both of the lights
were indeed green,

16:49.884 --> 16:52.386
we’ve also confirmed everything
my informant told us.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.056
The driver of the van
was, indeed, Bosco Jimenez,

16:55.056 --> 16:57.099
wheelman extraordinaire.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.309
WATSON:
Now he and his partner

16:58.309 --> 17:00.519
were using the van to skim fuel,

17:00.519 --> 17:02.605
but they never meant
for it to blow up.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.774
But the person who messed
with the traffic lights did?

17:04.774 --> 17:06.234
MAN:
I don’t buy it.

17:06.234 --> 17:08.027
Mara Tres is a street gang.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.654
None of their enemies
are sophisticated enough

17:09.654 --> 17:11.280
to take over a traffic grid.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.032
Well, I can
think of one.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.284
You.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.161
WATSON:
Say we never found out

17:17.161 --> 17:19.205
about the fuel-skimming.
Most people would’ve assumed

17:19.205 --> 17:22.250
that Mara Tres was getting
into the car-bombing business.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.960
And that likely would’ve been
all that you needed

17:23.960 --> 17:26.045
to have them declared
a terrorist organization.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.172
That would have meant more money
in your budget,

17:28.172 --> 17:29.590
better equipment.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.175
HOLMES: And permission
to use any number

17:31.175 --> 17:33.177
of draconian anti-terror
measures against them.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.263
Their demise would have been
all but assured.

17:35.263 --> 17:36.681
What the hell are you saying?

17:36.681 --> 17:38.224
He’s saying he thinks

17:38.224 --> 17:39.475
that the real terrorists

17:39.475 --> 17:40.935
are us.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.778
Before I start fielding calls
from the bosses

17:50.778 --> 17:52.989
of every agent you just insulted
in there, I want to know,

17:52.989 --> 17:54.699
what the hell were you thinking?

17:54.699 --> 17:56.242
We were thinking that,

17:56.242 --> 17:57.868
given our new understanding
of the facts,

17:57.868 --> 18:00.079
we were addressing the pool
of suspects most likely

18:00.079 --> 18:01.455
to have caused the crash.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.332
We wanted to see
how they reacted.

18:03.332 --> 18:04.750
HOLMES:
Having done that,

18:04.750 --> 18:07.420
we no longer think
any of them was involved.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.922
I mean, which is
still progress,

18:09.922 --> 18:11.799
because now that we’ve
ruled out the Task Force,

18:11.799 --> 18:13.551
we can move on to
other suspects.

18:13.551 --> 18:16.220
I thought
they were your only suspects.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.596
In fact, our theory
would hold for other,

18:17.596 --> 18:19.223
more powerful members
of the U.S. government.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.725
The Task Force’s superiors

18:20.725 --> 18:22.727
at Justice, perhaps,
or the attorney general.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.895
(laughs)
Attorney general?

18:24.895 --> 18:27.189
We should get Bell
to invite him down here, too.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.399
Oh, I didn’t know
they knew each other.

18:28.399 --> 18:29.942
Look, I don’t know what kind

18:29.942 --> 18:31.444
of arrangement
you had with Tommy.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.778
It was simple--
catch criminals,

18:32.778 --> 18:34.697
even at the expense
of their feelings.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.991
(knock at door)
Come in.

18:36.991 --> 18:40.202
A bit of good news-bad news
out there.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.704
Tried to smooth everything over,

18:41.704 --> 18:44.165
but it seems the Feds are
pretty touchy these days

18:44.165 --> 18:45.625
about having
their honor questioned.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.335
Most of ’em stormed off.

18:47.335 --> 18:49.337
And the good news?

18:49.337 --> 18:53.132
The one person who stayed is
an FBI agent named Dia Tanyag.

18:53.132 --> 18:56.218
She says Sherlock and Joan
might be onto something.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.387
TANYAG:
First,

18:58.387 --> 19:01.932
far as I know,
none of us arranged that crash.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.768
The only guys I could even
imagine going that far

19:03.768 --> 19:05.978
would be the two cowboys
we have from ICE,

19:05.978 --> 19:08.898
but I’m telling you,
they’re too dumb to pull it off.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.609
Even if that weren’t the case,

19:11.609 --> 19:14.862
we don’t need to kill anyone
to get a leg up on Mara Tres.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.113
We’ve already got one.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.573
What do you mean?

19:17.573 --> 19:19.950
Over the last couple years,
we’ve managed

19:19.950 --> 19:22.578
to take a lot of Mara Tres’s
pieces off the board.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.706
Most of their leadership
has been arrested, deported,

19:25.706 --> 19:28.334
forced to flee
or pushed underground.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.336
So you’re saying the house
of Mara Tres is crumbling,

19:30.336 --> 19:32.963
along with our theory.
Not all of it.

19:32.963 --> 19:35.299
I think you guys could be right

19:35.299 --> 19:37.593
about someone rigging
those traffic lights.

19:37.593 --> 19:40.638
A few months back,
someone planted

19:40.638 --> 19:44.350
a Trojan horse virus in the
city’s traffic control system.

19:44.350 --> 19:47.603
They used that code to override
dozens of traffic lights

19:47.603 --> 19:50.189
so a group of bank robbers
could make a clean getaway.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.816
I can put you in touch

19:51.816 --> 19:53.484
with the agent in charge,

19:53.484 --> 19:56.320
but last I heard,
they still haven’t found them,

19:56.320 --> 19:59.323
or the hacker
who engineered the virus.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.075
All we got
was his handle:

20:01.075 --> 20:03.369
"Overlord."

20:03.369 --> 20:05.204
You guys want

20:05.204 --> 20:07.706
to find the group
that caused that crash,

20:07.706 --> 20:09.708
I’d start with him.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.922
(footsteps approaching)

20:14.922 --> 20:16.590
What’s with all
the gelatin?

20:16.590 --> 20:20.052
It’s a gift from our hack-happy
helpers at Everyone.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.596
Oh, that was nice of them.
It’s the opposite, in fact.

20:22.596 --> 20:25.474
In exchange for searching
for Overlord’s true identity,

20:25.474 --> 20:27.935
I’ve been order to put
every ounce of this powder

20:27.935 --> 20:29.353
into my isolation chamber.

20:29.353 --> 20:32.398
They’ve asked for video evidence
within the hour.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.316
That’s actually
pretty funny.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.901
Let’s see how funny
you find it

20:35.901 --> 20:37.778
when you need
to use the bathroom

20:37.778 --> 20:41.240
later on, ’cause my chamber
is not the only tank of water

20:41.240 --> 20:43.534
I’ve been ordered
to gelatinize.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.745
Marcus, meanwhile,
is reaching out

20:46.745 --> 20:48.581
to the Department
of Transportation

20:48.581 --> 20:51.041
to learn more about the virus
which infected their system.

20:51.041 --> 20:53.836
How goes your reinvestigation
into Patrick Meers?

20:53.836 --> 20:56.589
I think I figured
out why Meers lied

20:56.589 --> 20:58.799
about when the captain
came to see him.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.468
He was protecting
an accomplice.

21:00.468 --> 21:03.179
The day he confessed,
he told me and Marcus

21:03.179 --> 21:04.680
that he followed the
captain from his office

21:04.680 --> 21:06.348
to the baseball field.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.142
Well, that would be a lie.
He would have followed him

21:08.142 --> 21:10.352
from the precinct
to the baseball field.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.146
You would think.

21:12.146 --> 21:14.356
But according to CCS,
several apps on Meers’ phone

21:14.356 --> 21:16.609
featured real-time
location tracking.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.069
All of them placed him at
his house until ten minutes

21:19.069 --> 21:20.946
before the captain
was shot.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.866
You think someone else had eyes
on the captain that night.

21:23.866 --> 21:26.285
That person followed him
to the baseball field

21:26.285 --> 21:27.870
and then called Meers
to the scene.

21:27.870 --> 21:30.289
Well, that would
support the idea

21:30.289 --> 21:32.291
that there is
a conspiracy afoot.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.877
Is there any evidence of Meers
receiving a call or a text?

21:34.877 --> 21:36.879
No, but that
doesn’t mean much.

21:36.879 --> 21:38.506
He and his partner
could have used burners.

21:38.506 --> 21:41.258
Well, the last time
you visited Meers,

21:41.258 --> 21:43.469
the captain’s prognosis
was grim.

21:43.469 --> 21:45.346
Now he’s on the mend.

21:45.346 --> 21:46.889
Well, Meers won’t be
charged as a cop killer,

21:46.889 --> 21:48.599
and he might even get
a shot at a deal

21:48.599 --> 21:50.476
if he flips on the people
he’s working with.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.728
Well, I have an isolation
chamber to desecrate.

21:52.728 --> 21:53.979
But if I were you,

21:53.979 --> 21:56.899
I’d think about
paying him a visit.

22:00.194 --> 22:02.780
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Mr. Halevi.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.657
Actually, it’s Maranek-Halevi.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.700
My wife and I hyphenated.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.286
Her idea.
No judgment here.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.789
(chuckles)
Then I already like you
better than my brother.

22:11.789 --> 22:13.457
So, this is it?

22:13.457 --> 22:15.668
Everything the Department
of Transportation has

22:15.668 --> 22:17.962
on Overlord’s
traffic grid virus?

22:17.962 --> 22:20.464
All 920 pages.

22:20.464 --> 22:23.259
Plus schematics on every
model of traffic light

22:23.259 --> 22:24.677
the robbers compromised
on their way

22:24.677 --> 22:26.720
to a New York City
land speed record.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.223
You do know I already
gave copies of this stuff

22:29.223 --> 22:31.308
to the FBI five
months ago?
Sorry,

22:31.308 --> 22:33.102
making you do this twice,
but the Bureau

22:33.102 --> 22:34.603
only had the case
for a minute.

22:34.603 --> 22:37.064
Agent who caught it
told me the NSA came in

22:37.064 --> 22:39.149
and took over, since they have
"technical jurisdiction"

22:39.149 --> 22:40.651
on hacking cases.
Let me guess.

22:40.651 --> 22:42.903
The NSA’s not too
big on sharing.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.656
To put it mildly.
Well, I’m happy to help.

22:45.656 --> 22:48.909
This Overlord guy pulled
our pants down at DOT.

22:48.909 --> 22:51.161
I’m not saying he’s my white
whale or anything, but...

22:51.161 --> 22:53.414
if helping you means he’d
hit even one red light,

22:53.414 --> 22:55.499
I’ll take it--
especially if he’s

22:55.499 --> 22:57.543
the one who caused that
accident the other night.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.795
You say "if."
Does that mean

22:59.795 --> 23:02.756
you haven’t found Overlord’s
virus in your system this time?

23:02.756 --> 23:04.550
We didn’t find it
the first time.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.927
His Trojan Horse was
a nasty piece of code.

23:06.927 --> 23:09.305
Not only did it wreak
havoc in our grid,

23:09.305 --> 23:11.599
it deleted itself
when it was done.

23:11.599 --> 23:13.392
So you don’t think
there’s anything in the data

23:13.392 --> 23:15.519
that’ll help us put a name
or face to this guy?

23:15.519 --> 23:18.188
It took weeks to find
even a trace of his code.

23:18.188 --> 23:20.065
And it wasn’t what
you’d call useful.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.734
It was just Overlord’s
hacker handle

23:21.734 --> 23:25.237
and a GIF of... a
raised middle finger.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.240
(chuckles) Sorry,
I... wish I had more.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.287
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

23:36.832 --> 23:38.792
It’s Jane, right?

23:38.792 --> 23:41.253
No, Joan.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.838
I know we only met
that one time,

23:42.838 --> 23:44.673
but I’ve always been
pretty good with names.

23:44.673 --> 23:47.176
I appreciate your taking
the time to speak with me.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.887
Time’s all I
have now, Joan.

23:49.887 --> 23:51.889
Actually,
I don’t think that’s true.

23:51.889 --> 23:53.432
That’s the reason I’m here.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.809
The police officer you shot,

23:55.809 --> 23:57.811
Captain Gregson,
he’s gonna live.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.146
Really?

24:00.564 --> 24:02.441
You seem disappointed.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.902
Why would I be disappointed?

24:04.902 --> 24:07.154
I already told you I
felt awful about that.

24:07.154 --> 24:08.864
The only person I
ever wanted to kill

24:08.864 --> 24:10.491
was Tim Bledsoe.

24:10.491 --> 24:12.701
Because he sucker-punched you
outside a bar?

24:12.701 --> 24:14.119
Right.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.747
The reason I’m here, Mr. Meers,

24:16.747 --> 24:20.167
is because I think there’s
a little more to it than that.

24:20.167 --> 24:23.253
Tim Bledsoe built a bomb,
and you knew about it.
(chuckles softly)

24:23.253 --> 24:24.797
I already told you.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.924
I didn’t know what
he was up to.

24:26.924 --> 24:29.677
Me shooting him when I did,
it was a coincidence.

24:29.677 --> 24:32.805
The captain is conscious
and talking now,

24:32.805 --> 24:35.140
so we know that you lied
about when he came to see you.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.934
What we don’t know is why.

24:36.934 --> 24:38.686
Now, my best guess:

24:38.686 --> 24:40.270
you’re protecting someone.

24:42.231 --> 24:44.483
The captain lived--
that’s good for you.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.485
So the D.A. might be willing

24:46.485 --> 24:48.737
to consider
a plea deal now.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.489
You tell us the truth
about everything you know,

24:50.489 --> 24:52.116
and you might not have to spend

24:52.116 --> 24:53.784
the rest of your life
behind bars.

24:53.784 --> 24:56.286
I wish I could
help you, Joan.

24:56.286 --> 24:58.247
I really do.

24:58.247 --> 25:01.041
But I’ve said all I’m
gonna say about it.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.001
What about your wife?

25:03.001 --> 25:05.129
Your children.

25:05.129 --> 25:07.381
Do you even care that
they’re gonna grow up thinking

25:07.381 --> 25:09.341
that their father
was a terrorist?

25:09.341 --> 25:11.510
A terrorist?
You were working

25:11.510 --> 25:13.303
with Tim, right, that’s
how you knew about the bomb?

25:13.303 --> 25:14.304
No.
You were

25:14.304 --> 25:15.681
in the same group, or cell.

25:15.681 --> 25:16.932
Something happened,

25:16.932 --> 25:18.392
so your plans changed.

25:18.392 --> 25:20.269
So Tim and his bomb had to go.

25:20.269 --> 25:21.478
No.
Someone in the group

25:21.478 --> 25:22.604
realized that the captain

25:22.604 --> 25:23.856
was gonna find Tim’s body,

25:23.856 --> 25:26.066
so he, or she,
messaged you to get

25:26.066 --> 25:27.776
to the baseball field
right away.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.945
I told you I’m not
a terrorist, damn it!

25:29.945 --> 25:32.239
(breath trembling)

25:32.239 --> 25:34.324
I’m done talking.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.619
(doorbell rings)

25:39.913 --> 25:41.749
You’re Sherlock Holmes?

25:41.749 --> 25:42.916
You’re NSA?

25:42.916 --> 25:44.251
Agent Heller.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.170
And this is Overlord.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.422
But we mostly
just call him Phil.

25:49.757 --> 25:50.758
Right.

25:56.764 --> 25:58.640
Before we hand him over,

25:58.640 --> 26:00.934
Agent McNally asked
me to ask you:

26:00.934 --> 26:04.146
How’d you know that we, uh,
brought him into the fold?

26:04.146 --> 26:06.356
Suffice it to say the NSA
does not have a monopoly

26:06.356 --> 26:08.275
on making friends
of dangerous hackers.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.360
Mine were set to the task
of identifying Overlord.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.196
They failed to do so
via his code,

26:12.196 --> 26:15.240
but stumbled
upon a flame war

26:15.240 --> 26:18.285
between him and another hacker,
Mouse Queen, on a chat board.

26:18.285 --> 26:19.870
Things got personal,
and the locations

26:19.870 --> 26:21.789
of genital moles
were mentioned,

26:21.789 --> 26:24.541
and I realized it was
a lovers’ quarrel.

26:24.541 --> 26:26.710
And while your friends
couldn’t ID Phil here,

26:26.710 --> 26:28.295
they could ID
Mouse Queen.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.130
She not only gave me
Phil’s real name,

26:30.130 --> 26:31.799
but she also admitted
to being the one

26:31.799 --> 26:33.258
who turned him over
to your agency.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.427
Wait? What?
You guys never told me that.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.887
Phil made a deal.

26:36.887 --> 26:38.514
He works with us for
the foreseeable future,

26:38.514 --> 26:40.849
and doesn’t go to prison
for any of his hacks.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.476
But here’s the thing.

26:42.476 --> 26:44.061
He’s heavily monitored,
and has been for months.

26:44.061 --> 26:45.270
That means there’s
no way he’s responsible

26:45.270 --> 26:46.855
for the crash
you’re looking into.

26:46.855 --> 26:49.107
I assumed so.
But that doesn’t rule out

26:49.107 --> 26:51.527
the possibility that his code
was used by a friend.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.446
Phil?

26:54.446 --> 26:55.948
It’s just that...

26:55.948 --> 26:57.407
the guys I sent it to,
they’re my pals.

26:57.407 --> 26:58.826
And before
I rat them out,

26:58.826 --> 27:00.702
I just need to know
that it was my code

27:00.702 --> 27:02.204
that caused that crash.

27:02.204 --> 27:04.832
How many traffic light
cheat codes can there be?

27:04.832 --> 27:06.333
You’d be surprised.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.335
You told him that the DOT

27:08.335 --> 27:10.420
gave you and the cops
a whole bunch of data

27:10.420 --> 27:12.339
from the night it
happened, right?
Yeah.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.383
Let me see it.
I’ll know if it was

27:14.383 --> 27:16.134
my code that got used,
and if it was,

27:16.134 --> 27:17.219
then I’ll give you

27:17.219 --> 27:20.389
all the names you want.

27:20.389 --> 27:23.392
Okay, I need you to pull up
traffic cam footage

27:23.392 --> 27:24.393
from another light--
you ready?
Mm-hmm.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.519
Sector D-41.

27:25.519 --> 27:27.771
9:42 p.m.

27:27.771 --> 27:31.441
Serial number TC-311-899.

27:31.441 --> 27:33.819
Okay. Pulling up footage
of that light... now.

27:33.819 --> 27:36.029
HOLMES:
Why are you looking
at every light

27:36.029 --> 27:38.156
in the area except the one
that caused the crash?

27:38.156 --> 27:40.576
Because according
to this data from the DOT,

27:40.576 --> 27:42.786
a bunch of lights that night
were hacked.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.371
I figured we should
check all of them.

27:44.371 --> 27:46.665
Turns out that
whoever did this

27:46.665 --> 27:49.167
tried more than once
to crash that van that night.

27:49.167 --> 27:50.210
Good news is,

27:50.210 --> 27:51.795
wasn’t any of my friends.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.046
How can you be sure?

27:53.046 --> 27:54.172
Well, when my virus

27:54.172 --> 27:56.091
overrode a traffic light,

27:56.091 --> 27:58.093
the light would flicker twice.

27:58.093 --> 28:00.762
It was a bug.
But these lights we’ve been

28:00.762 --> 28:02.848
looking at all night, not
one of them has flickered.

28:02.848 --> 28:05.726
You said there was more than
one attempt to crash the van.
Oh, yeah.

28:05.726 --> 28:09.646
Well, just look at all
these lights along Broadway.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.440
They were hacked, too.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.567
They kept turning green,

28:13.567 --> 28:15.777
one after another.
It was just a matter of time

28:15.777 --> 28:17.112
before that van got in a wreck.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.280
No, it wasn’t.

28:18.280 --> 28:19.948
The path you
just highlighted

28:19.948 --> 28:22.910
was not the path of the van,
it was the path of the truck.

28:22.910 --> 28:24.661
Wait. That would mean
that the hacker

28:24.661 --> 28:26.747
wasn’t gunning
for the Mara Tres guys.

28:26.747 --> 28:29.166
He was gunning
for the truck driver.

28:29.166 --> 28:31.543
We’ve been coming at this
all wrong.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.221
This is crazy.

28:43.221 --> 28:44.973
You sure I’m the one
they were gunning for?

28:44.973 --> 28:46.892
If you look at the map,
you could see, you got

28:46.892 --> 28:49.186
a whole string of greens from
the George Washington Bridge

28:49.186 --> 28:51.271
into Harlem.

28:51.271 --> 28:53.398
That let you build up
a head of steam.

28:53.398 --> 28:56.068
And then here,
60 seconds before your collision

28:56.068 --> 28:57.903
with the van,
you and a city bus

28:57.903 --> 28:59.488
drew simultaneous greens.

28:59.488 --> 29:01.490
It was the hacker’s
first attempt

29:01.490 --> 29:03.325
to do you harm.
In addition
to controlling

29:03.325 --> 29:04.785
the lights,
we’re pretty sure

29:04.785 --> 29:06.995
he got into the traffic
cameras in the area.

29:06.995 --> 29:09.790
He was watching for you, trying
to line you up for a crash.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.500
Footage from that intersection

29:11.500 --> 29:13.543
shows the bus slamming on
its brakes, but you,

29:13.543 --> 29:15.754
on the other hand,
didn’t seem to notice.
Guess I didn’t.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.172
Had my music up loud.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.007
I was singing.

29:19.007 --> 29:21.802
I was in a great mood
that night: all those greens,

29:21.802 --> 29:24.346
I thought my luck
was changing.
What do you mean?

29:24.346 --> 29:26.306
I mean, driving
in that part of town

29:26.306 --> 29:28.350
has been awful
the last few months.

29:28.350 --> 29:30.227
I would never get greens.

29:30.227 --> 29:32.562
Just reds, one after another.

29:32.562 --> 29:34.731
Can you think of anyone
who wants to do you harm?

29:34.731 --> 29:36.900
No one.
Think, Jarius.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.777
Look, at the risk
of sounding prideful,

29:38.777 --> 29:40.278
I’m a nice guy.

29:40.278 --> 29:41.405
God-fearing.
I go to church.

29:41.405 --> 29:43.865
Don’t drink, don’t gamble.

29:43.865 --> 29:45.075
Any exes?

29:45.075 --> 29:46.535
Romantic rivals?

29:46.535 --> 29:48.578
No one.
Any insurance policies
out on you?

29:48.578 --> 29:50.330
No.
Did you see

29:50.330 --> 29:51.540
anything you shouldn’t have,

29:51.540 --> 29:54.042
either at work
or in your neighborhood?

29:54.042 --> 29:56.086
Our neighborhood’s great.
So are the people I work for.

29:56.086 --> 29:57.963
I thank God for them every day.

29:57.963 --> 30:00.924
And if I had seen
something illegal somewhere,

30:00.924 --> 30:02.217
I would’ve gone
to the police.

30:02.217 --> 30:03.552
Look, I’m telling you,

30:03.552 --> 30:05.762
there’s no one
who wants me dead.

30:05.762 --> 30:07.723
Well, in that case,

30:07.723 --> 30:10.100
what were you hauling
that night?

30:10.100 --> 30:12.477
I don’t know
exactly. Why?

30:12.477 --> 30:13.729
’Cause if you weren’t
the target,

30:13.729 --> 30:15.647
then we have to assume
your truck was.

30:15.647 --> 30:16.982
Everything was in big crates.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.984
No one told me
what was in them.

30:18.984 --> 30:21.028
But I was headed
to this...

30:21.028 --> 30:23.155
construction site
on West 57th.

30:23.155 --> 30:24.823
I figured it was stuff
they needed

30:24.823 --> 30:26.867
to build their building,
a big skyscraper.

30:26.867 --> 30:29.369
I’ve been making drop-offs
to them for months.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.329
But why would someone
want to blow up

30:31.329 --> 30:33.248
a bunch of building supplies?

30:33.248 --> 30:34.666
Well, that’s a good question.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.626
And it depends
what was in those crates.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.006
Elevators. That’s what
that truck was delivering.

30:41.006 --> 30:42.591
Elevators?

30:42.591 --> 30:44.843
The best that
money can buy.

30:44.843 --> 30:48.221
Imagine flying up a hundred
floors in less than 40 seconds.

30:48.221 --> 30:51.808
My client wants his tower
mentioned in the same
breath as One World Trade.

30:51.808 --> 30:54.394
Figured four of the
fastest elevators in
the world would do it.

30:54.394 --> 30:57.022
Each one clocked in
at a cool $3 million.

30:57.022 --> 31:00.692
If you’re right, if that
crash the other night

31:00.692 --> 31:02.903
was deliberate...

31:02.903 --> 31:06.198
that would mean someone’s
trying to sabotage me.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.700
Well, say they were,
Mr. Dewashe.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.161
Construction budgets
have cushions built in

31:11.161 --> 31:12.954
to absorb overruns, right?

31:12.954 --> 31:15.082
And those elevators
had to be insured.

31:15.082 --> 31:17.334
So if someone was
looking to hurt you,

31:17.334 --> 31:19.711
was this really
the best way to do it?

31:19.711 --> 31:21.421
In the short term, no.
No, you’re right,

31:21.421 --> 31:23.173
the insurance will pay
for the new elevators.

31:23.173 --> 31:25.300
But... it’ll take time.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.968
This job will be delayed,

31:26.968 --> 31:29.262
but the next one
may not even happen.

31:29.262 --> 31:31.348
What do you mean?

31:31.348 --> 31:34.309
A few months ago, I won a bid
to put up this building.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.520
It’s part of Hudson Yards.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.021
Worth billions.

31:38.021 --> 31:39.940
But the bid
is contingent upon me

31:39.940 --> 31:42.734
wrapping up my current job
on time.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.736
You happen to know who
the next highest bidder was?

31:44.736 --> 31:46.905
A company called
Maranek Construction.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.532
Maranek?

31:48.532 --> 31:50.325
You heard of ’em?
The company,

31:50.325 --> 31:51.827
no, but...

31:51.827 --> 31:53.120
I know the name.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.538
HOLMES:
Marcus.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.373
Hey. I just wrapped up

31:56.373 --> 31:57.958
with the head
of the construction company.

31:57.958 --> 32:00.001
He’s positive
his truck was targeted.

32:00.001 --> 32:02.838
He thinks it was a competitor
of his, Maranek Construction.

32:02.838 --> 32:05.715
Thing is, I met a Maranek
just the other day.

32:05.715 --> 32:07.801
The guy from the DOT.
The one who brought me

32:07.801 --> 32:09.594
everything they had
on the Overlord hack.

32:09.594 --> 32:12.222
His name was
Saul Maranek-Halevi.

32:12.222 --> 32:14.641
I did a search.
Turns out he’s the son-in-law

32:14.641 --> 32:16.518
of the guy
who owns Maranek Construction.

32:16.518 --> 32:19.020
He’s the one who caused
that crash. Got to be.

32:19.020 --> 32:21.106
There was no virus
in the DOT’s system.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.859
He probably did what he did
from his desk.

32:23.859 --> 32:25.902
Hey, you there?

32:25.902 --> 32:28.155
I am, and I think
you’re right about everything.

32:28.155 --> 32:30.949
Good. I’ll pick you up,
and we’ll pay him a visit.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.285
Actually,
I’m with him right now.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.495
You are?
Something came over my scanner

32:35.495 --> 32:36.955
that I thought
I should look into.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.082
Suspected Mara Tres activity.

32:39.082 --> 32:41.668
Two heavily tattooed shooters
gunned down a man

32:41.668 --> 32:43.295
outside his home.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.796
Don’t tell me.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.048
Yeah.

32:47.048 --> 32:49.926
Saul Maranek-Halevi
is dead.

32:52.053 --> 32:54.264
Everything that has happened
in the last few weeks,

32:54.264 --> 32:56.766
there’s just--
there’s no explaining it.

32:56.766 --> 32:58.393
But if there is one thing

32:58.393 --> 32:59.769
that I can tell you
for sure, one thing

32:59.769 --> 33:01.980
that I know in my heart,

33:01.980 --> 33:04.733
it’s that Patrick
is no terrorist.

33:04.733 --> 33:07.027
Then how can you explain
him shooting Tim Bledsoe

33:07.027 --> 33:09.654
one day before he was gonna
blow up the ferry?

33:09.654 --> 33:10.989
Patrick said that
was a coincidence.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.532
I believe him.

33:12.532 --> 33:15.160
Okay,

33:15.160 --> 33:17.245
you want to know why
he joined the army?

33:18.955 --> 33:20.665
His father was a fireman.

33:20.665 --> 33:23.168
He was in the South Tower
the day that it fell.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.587
Patrick was just
in high school.

33:25.587 --> 33:27.756
What he went through that
day, he would never put

33:27.756 --> 33:29.799
someone else
through that. Never.

33:29.799 --> 33:32.177
Patrick got back from
Afghanistan a few months

33:32.177 --> 33:34.012
before he shot Tim.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.056
Was it hard for him, adjusting?

33:36.056 --> 33:37.599
Well, yeah, sure.

33:37.599 --> 33:39.351
But it’s hard for
a lot of people.

33:41.269 --> 33:44.022
Was he spending time
with any new friends?

33:44.022 --> 33:47.400
As in "friends that
would blow up a ferry"?

33:47.400 --> 33:48.818
No.

33:48.818 --> 33:51.029
Truth is, he mostly
kept to himself.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.573
If he wasn’t at work or with
the kids, he was just in there,

33:53.573 --> 33:54.824
playing his game.

33:54.824 --> 33:56.076
His game?

33:56.076 --> 33:58.912
It was some...
shooting thing.

33:58.912 --> 34:00.997
I didn’t like it,
but he was hooked.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.208
He’d play it
for hours.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.543
Do you mind if I take a look?

34:05.543 --> 34:08.004
(growling sounds)
HOLLY:
Why did you want to see this?

34:08.004 --> 34:11.091
You said that Patrick wasn’t
spending time with anyone new.

34:11.091 --> 34:13.885
Games like these
usually have a chat function

34:13.885 --> 34:16.721
so you can talk
to other players.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.306
And since we didn’t find
anything unusual

34:18.306 --> 34:20.892
in Patrick’s texts or e-mails...

34:20.892 --> 34:23.561
HOLLY: So you thought
you’d check his video game?

34:23.561 --> 34:26.147
Do you know
who R00kR3d is?

34:26.147 --> 34:27.399
No.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.901
Looks like he’s online.

34:39.536 --> 34:41.705
(snarling sounds)

34:44.165 --> 34:45.542
(phone ringing)

34:45.542 --> 34:47.669
(sighs)

34:50.297 --> 34:51.798
Hello.

34:51.798 --> 34:54.301
HALCON:
Hey. It’s me, hittin’ you back.

34:54.301 --> 34:56.052
You were right.

34:56.052 --> 34:58.388
Mara Tres did gun down your boy.

34:58.388 --> 35:00.932
May I ask why?

35:00.932 --> 35:03.143
One of ’em got a call
this morning.

35:03.143 --> 35:05.729
The guy on the other line,
he wouldn’t say who it was--

35:05.729 --> 35:08.648
just that a Saul Maranek-Halevi

35:08.648 --> 35:12.152
is the one who got Bosco killed
in that crash.

35:12.152 --> 35:15.238
And your former friends just
took him at his word, did they?

35:15.238 --> 35:16.740
Oh, no, no. They checked.

35:16.740 --> 35:19.492
Saw that Maranek-Halevi
worked at the DOT,

35:19.492 --> 35:20.952
and that was that.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.495
Hey,

35:22.495 --> 35:25.123
you wanted him
brought to justice, right?

35:25.123 --> 35:27.751
Mara Tres just beat you to it.

35:27.751 --> 35:30.879
Look, I know you’ve been out
of the murder game for a while,

35:30.879 --> 35:32.922
but do you think
your old friends were tipped off

35:32.922 --> 35:35.342
by a doe-eyed innocent or...

35:35.342 --> 35:37.886
by a coconspirator
of Maranek-Halevi’s

35:37.886 --> 35:40.138
looking to use them
to tie up a loose end?

35:42.223 --> 35:44.517
Yeah.

35:44.517 --> 35:47.354
I see what you mean.

35:47.354 --> 35:49.147
I got to say, I’m, uh...

35:49.147 --> 35:50.690
I’m a little embarrassed, yo.

35:50.690 --> 35:53.109
You should be.

35:53.109 --> 35:56.696
If I’m right,
the dead man was just a puppet.

35:56.696 --> 35:59.491
The person pulling his strings

35:59.491 --> 36:01.576
is gonna get away
with everything.

36:05.914 --> 36:08.667
Aw, come on in. (grunts)
Julie’s inside. It’ll mean

36:08.667 --> 36:11.711
a lot to her
that you’re here.

36:11.711 --> 36:13.505
BELL:
Cameron Maranek?

36:13.505 --> 36:15.173
I’m Detective Bell.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.591
This is Mr. Holmes.

36:16.591 --> 36:17.926
We’re investigating
what happened

36:17.926 --> 36:19.302
to your son-in-law,
Saul.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.304
We were hoping we could discuss
the case with you.

36:21.304 --> 36:23.598
Do we have to do this now?

36:23.598 --> 36:25.809
I mean, my daughter’s
grieving inside.

36:25.809 --> 36:28.603
I got the whole family
over here.
Our apologies

36:28.603 --> 36:30.605
for the intrusion, but there may
be a way that you can help us

36:30.605 --> 36:32.649
apprehend the person responsible
for Saul’s death.

36:32.649 --> 36:36.152
Person responsible?
Was told it was a gang killing,

36:36.152 --> 36:37.195
that it must’ve
been random.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.947
A gang did commit
the act, yes,

36:38.947 --> 36:40.407
but we think someone
may have steered them to it.

36:40.407 --> 36:42.826
This is all
pretty time-sensitive.

36:42.826 --> 36:45.036
And like we said,
we could really use your help.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.955
Maybe there’s someplace private
we could talk?

36:48.123 --> 36:49.791
MARANEK:
So,

36:49.791 --> 36:52.752
Saul jerry-rigged
the traffic lights to cause

36:52.752 --> 36:57.882
the crash so that the elevators
on the truck were destroyed?

36:57.882 --> 37:01.261
And Mr. Dewashe’s company
would, in turn, lose the job

37:01.261 --> 37:04.055
they had successfully bid on
at Hudson Yards.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.473
Thing is,
we don’t think Saul

37:05.473 --> 37:07.267
ever meant to destroy
the elevators.

37:07.267 --> 37:09.394
When he gave that van
a green light,

37:09.394 --> 37:11.479
there’s no way he could’ve known
it was being driven

37:11.479 --> 37:13.231
by two Mara Tres
soldiers

37:13.231 --> 37:14.983
or that it was
full of gasoline.
Mm.

37:14.983 --> 37:17.485
It’s more likely he just wanted
to delay the elevators

37:17.485 --> 37:19.529
while the accident
was investigated.

37:19.529 --> 37:21.990
Just a day or two would’ve set
Dewashe back considerably.

37:21.990 --> 37:23.491
BELL: When it came out
in the news

37:23.491 --> 37:26.411
that the driver who died
was a member of Mara Tres,

37:26.411 --> 37:28.580
the person working with Saul
saw an opportunity.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.582
He tipped the gang
to Saul’s identity,

37:30.582 --> 37:32.125
and they killed him
without realizing

37:32.125 --> 37:34.043
they were doing his partner
a favor.

37:34.043 --> 37:35.462
(sighs)

37:35.462 --> 37:38.131
Saul. Mm.

37:38.131 --> 37:40.175
Were you not fond
of your son-in-law?

37:40.175 --> 37:41.593
No. Don’t get me wrong.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.511
I mean, he was kind to Julie,

37:43.511 --> 37:44.596
and that’s all that mattered.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.389
But...

37:46.389 --> 37:48.349
she could’ve done better.

37:48.349 --> 37:50.268
So, uh,

37:50.268 --> 37:52.520
you said there’s a way
I can help you?

37:52.520 --> 37:54.189
Whoever was behind it all,

37:54.189 --> 37:56.566
what they did was pretty smart.

37:56.566 --> 37:59.402
With Saul dead, there was
no way for us to ID him.

37:59.402 --> 38:00.904
We thought
that was that.

38:00.904 --> 38:04.240
But then Mr. Holmes here thought
of a way we could flush him out.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.951
Yeah, it just so happens
I once investigated

38:06.951 --> 38:08.453
a matter
for the Japanese firm

38:08.453 --> 38:10.914
which manufactured
the damaged elevators.

38:10.914 --> 38:13.708
As a favor to me, they agreed
to call Mr. Dewashe’s company

38:13.708 --> 38:15.877
this morning and promise
to replace the elevators

38:15.877 --> 38:17.003
by tomorrow evening.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.464
Ah. Lucky for Dewashe.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.257
It would be,
if it were true.

38:21.257 --> 38:23.134
Sorry?

38:23.134 --> 38:25.553
The Japanese firm agreed
to say all of this,

38:25.553 --> 38:27.514
but none of it’s true.
It didn’t have to be.

38:27.514 --> 38:30.725
It just had to sound true
to your mole inside

38:30.725 --> 38:32.143
Dewashe’s company.
No, no, no.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.645
You hang on just one second.
BELL: There’s no point

38:33.645 --> 38:35.146
denying it, Mr. Maranek.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.898
We even know who the mole is.

38:36.898 --> 38:39.150
Her name is Sandra Bay,

38:39.150 --> 38:41.945
and she’s Dewashe’s
transportation coordinator.

38:41.945 --> 38:44.072
According to the company’s
phone records,

38:44.072 --> 38:45.865
she made a lot of calls
to a burner phone

38:45.865 --> 38:47.033
the last few months.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.117
Every time she did,

38:48.117 --> 38:49.744
Dewashe would suffer
a mysterious

38:49.744 --> 38:52.872
scheduling snag the same day.

38:52.872 --> 38:54.415
It’s almost as if the traffic
grid itself were conspiring

38:54.415 --> 38:57.544
against them,
which, it turns out, it was.

38:57.544 --> 38:59.587
Your son-in-law had been
interfering with trucks

38:59.587 --> 39:00.880
headed to Dewashe’s
construction site

39:00.880 --> 39:02.924
on 57th Street for months.

39:02.924 --> 39:04.717
Perhaps you coerced him
into manipulating

39:04.717 --> 39:06.761
the traffic lights
via emotional blackmail,

39:06.761 --> 39:09.764
promising you would finally
accept him as one of the family.

39:09.764 --> 39:12.433
Or perhaps you and he
had a financial arrangement.

39:12.433 --> 39:15.019
I suppose there’s no way
we’ll ever really know.

39:15.019 --> 39:17.480
Unless you tell us.

39:17.480 --> 39:20.775
Which you’ll have plenty of time
to do in custody.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.485
(phone chimes)

39:24.654 --> 39:28.408
I suppose I should tell you
how we got to Sandra.

39:28.408 --> 39:30.618
The burner phone
I mentioned,

39:30.618 --> 39:33.496
it was also used to deliver
the anonymous tip to Mara Tres.

39:33.496 --> 39:36.624
An informant inside the gang
gave Mr. Holmes the number.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.626
We got a subpoena
to check its activity.

39:38.626 --> 39:40.420
And, bam, there they were:

39:40.420 --> 39:43.089
all those calls
to and from Sandra.

39:43.089 --> 39:45.216
We’ve had eyes
on her ever since.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.427
This says she just got the news
about the new elevators

39:47.427 --> 39:49.804
and that she’s stepping
outside to make a call.

39:49.804 --> 39:52.432
(phone ringing)

39:55.977 --> 39:58.104
You gonna answer that?

39:58.104 --> 40:00.607
(phone continues ringing)

40:00.607 --> 40:02.859
(grunts)

40:02.859 --> 40:04.861
WATSON: Look who’s
up and around.

40:04.861 --> 40:06.571
(chuckles)

40:06.571 --> 40:08.406
Halfway up.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.283
It’s progress.
I got to get ready.

40:10.283 --> 40:11.784
They’re kicking me out
next week.

40:11.784 --> 40:12.785
You look better.

40:12.785 --> 40:13.786
Can I borrow him?

40:15.955 --> 40:18.291
I got your text.

40:18.291 --> 40:22.086
CCS have any luck identifying
this R00kR3d person?

40:22.086 --> 40:25.089
No, there’s no trace of him
on the Kill Zombies Dead server.

40:25.089 --> 40:26.674
It’s like he was never there.

40:26.674 --> 40:28.593
Best guess,
someone got into their system

40:28.593 --> 40:30.303
and then erased him.

40:30.303 --> 40:33.890
Or maybe an outfit
named Kill Zombies Dead

40:33.890 --> 40:36.809
doesn’t keep
the most meticulous record.

40:36.809 --> 40:38.269
Something’s up.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.897
Something strange.

40:40.897 --> 40:43.900
(sighs) I mean,
Meers absolutely knew

40:43.900 --> 40:45.193
what Bledsoe was up to.

40:45.193 --> 40:47.528
Yet I believed him

40:47.528 --> 40:49.989
when he said
he isn’t a terrorist.
Joan,

40:49.989 --> 40:52.659
the guys in ISIS don’t think
they’re terrorists either.

40:52.659 --> 40:55.244
They think they’re
the good guys.

40:55.244 --> 40:57.622
We’ll have to stay on him.

40:57.622 --> 41:00.917
We’ll figure it out.

41:00.917 --> 41:03.586
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

41:17.141 --> 41:19.352
No.

41:19.352 --> 41:21.604
No, I think...

41:21.604 --> 41:23.564
I think I made
a mistake.

41:23.564 --> 41:26.025
A detective came
to the house. A woman.

41:26.025 --> 41:27.860
Was her name Joan?

41:29.320 --> 41:31.989
I didn’t tell
her anything.

41:31.989 --> 41:33.950
I don’t-- I don’t
know anything.

41:33.950 --> 41:35.660
Not really.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.995
But she asked to see
your gaming system,

41:37.995 --> 41:39.247
and I told her that
she could. I know.

41:39.247 --> 41:40.957
I’m sorry. I
should never have...

41:40.957 --> 41:41.916
It’s all right.

41:41.916 --> 41:43.668
She came to see me, too.

41:43.668 --> 41:46.796
I was expecting
something like this.

41:46.796 --> 41:49.215
The video game.

41:49.215 --> 41:50.675
Is that how you talk to them?

41:54.887 --> 41:57.056
Okay, they-they would
never hurt the kids,

41:57.056 --> 41:59.350

41:59.350 --> 42:02.478
