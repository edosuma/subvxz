01:33.718 --> 01:35.970
- Any problems in the bedroom?

01:37.555 --> 01:39.224
Please stand up.

01:45.688 --> 01:48.399
Turn your head and cough,
please.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.152
Again.

01:51.486 --> 01:52.529
Good.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.990
Please lie on your side.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.663
All right.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.206
Relax.

02:03.581 --> 02:05.750
Now flex.

02:09.087 --> 02:12.799
Good. Now lie on your back.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.020
This may feel a little cold.

02:30.233 --> 02:36.239
As always, no alcohol,
tobacco, red meat, stress...

03:59.697 --> 04:02.492
Sugita isn't scheduled.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.201
He says it's pressing.

04:09.707 --> 04:10.291
Tozawa-san...

04:13.002 --> 04:16.339
in light of recent events...

04:18.007 --> 04:20.009
perhaps we would all benefit
from a reconsideration

04:20.093 --> 04:25.765
of our...business model.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.310
I'm thinking of your exposure.

04:29.644 --> 04:33.231
As well as mine.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.831
We shall continue as we have.

04:49.914 --> 04:53.418
I am grateful for your time.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.253
Excuse me.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.125
- Oh, my God,
Joshua Jacob Adelstein,

05:34.208 --> 05:37.045
you have been holding out
on me.

05:37.128 --> 05:38.713
Mr. Philips says
you once beat up

05:38.796 --> 05:40.089
some kid in his classroom.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.049
- Is that true?

05:41.132 --> 05:43.342
And you're right.
He sucks.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.886
I'm going to graduate
high school knowing

05:44.969 --> 05:47.680
nothing about chemistry.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.432
And Mom's, like,
seriously freaking out.

05:49.515 --> 05:53.895
Please call her more,
or I'm gonna lose my mind.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.898
She's, like, batshit crazy.

05:56.981 --> 06:01.069
Seriously, you--you smashed
this kid's face into his desk?

06:01.152 --> 06:02.904
Do Mom and Dad know this?

06:10.286 --> 06:11.579
- Arigato gozaimasu.

06:41.776 --> 06:44.070
Tengu! Tengu! A Tengu is here!

06:45.238 --> 06:46.447
- What's wrong, Natchan?

06:49.075 --> 06:50.493
I apologize.

06:50.576 --> 06:54.956
- Not at all. I am often
mistaken for a goblin.

06:56.541 --> 07:00.294
May I speak with
Detective Katagiri?

07:00.378 --> 07:05.133
- That would be difficult,
Mr...Adelstein,

07:05.216 --> 07:07.468
as my husband is not home.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.762
But I will tell him you came.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.391
- Do you expect him soon?

07:16.018 --> 07:19.772
- I apologize if you have
traveled far.

07:23.651 --> 07:27.989
- Please, take the ice cream.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.658
- Natsumi! Ice cream!

07:30.741 --> 07:31.784
- Yay!

07:31.868 --> 07:34.954
- And the beer.

07:36.205 --> 07:37.623
- Thank you.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.508
- Hey.

08:00.855 --> 08:01.856
Beer and sweets.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.649
Let me guess.

08:03.733 --> 08:07.737
The "Meicho" told you
this is how you recruit a cop.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.823
- I was just hoping that it
would get me through the door.

08:17.038 --> 08:20.666
Last night,
when you convinced that guy

08:20.750 --> 08:22.752
just to hand over his gun,

08:22.835 --> 08:23.920
what'd you say?

08:25.254 --> 08:28.883
- It's complicated.
- Hmm.

08:28.966 --> 08:32.637
Is there--is there anything
else that you can give me?

08:32.720 --> 08:35.056
- Give you?
- Yeah, I didn't write anything

08:35.139 --> 08:36.390
about the other night,
like you asked.

08:36.474 --> 08:39.185
I helped you.
Now can you help me?

08:40.353 --> 08:42.813
- It is late.
Thank you for the beer.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.317
- Wait.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.446
- What do you really want,
Mr. Adelstein?

08:51.280 --> 08:52.573
- I want to learn
how this city...

08:52.657 --> 08:57.328
What's beneath the surface...
how it works.

08:58.287 --> 09:00.456
Then I can write
what is actually happening.

09:02.333 --> 09:06.045
But right now, I can't do that.

09:11.342 --> 09:15.846
The truth is,
I don't know what I'm doing.

09:19.183 --> 09:22.979
- "A path opens
to those who are honest."

09:26.524 --> 09:26.607
Sit.

09:30.194 --> 09:33.281
- You sound like my dad.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.158
- A cop?

09:36.242 --> 09:37.952
- A coroner.

09:38.035 --> 09:40.288
- I have known
some good coroners.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.291
- No, thank you.

09:48.796 --> 09:52.341
At the bar, what was that?

09:53.509 --> 09:54.468
- Off the record.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.721
- Absolutely.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.099
- The roots of the yakuza
run so deep,

10:00.182 --> 10:02.351
we can never get rid of them,

10:02.435 --> 10:04.020
so cops are encouraged
to maintain peace

10:04.103 --> 10:07.481
among the different gangs.

10:07.565 --> 10:10.943
Tokyo has been stable
these last few years.

10:12.153 --> 10:16.490
But now Shinzo Tozawa and his
men have come from Kansai

10:16.574 --> 10:20.995
to try and claim
a local gang's territory.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.330
That's what you saw.

10:22.413 --> 10:26.375
A low-level move
on Chihara-kai turf.

10:27.585 --> 10:28.502
But you didn't tell the world,

10:28.586 --> 10:32.882
so they can pretend
it didn't happen.

10:32.965 --> 10:36.177
Maybe they don't retaliate,
and peace can hold.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.015
- So I'm the one
who kept the peace?

10:46.437 --> 10:48.522
Cheers!

10:49.815 --> 10:53.903
- Oh! Listen up! Polina,
do that thing you do, please?

10:53.986 --> 10:55.363
- Sure.

10:55.446 --> 10:59.575
Frog jump jump,
three jump jump,

10:59.658 --> 11:02.787
altogether jump jump,
six jump jump...

11:11.670 --> 11:14.673
- Polina! You're better
at it that we are!

11:16.467 --> 11:18.260
- Excuse me.
Samantha-san, please.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.847
- Hai. Please excuse me.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.432
- Bye!

11:24.433 --> 11:26.227
- New customer. Wants you.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.311
- Hai.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.481
- This is Momo.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.665
- And a very
good evening to you.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.084
- If you're trying
to impress me,

11:50.167 --> 11:51.252
mission accomplished.

11:51.335 --> 11:52.253
I'm Samantha.

11:52.336 --> 11:55.589
- Matsuo.
A pleasure.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.174
- Matsuo.

11:59.009 --> 12:00.928
Like Matsuo Basho?

12:01.011 --> 12:02.471
- You know Basho?

12:04.056 --> 12:06.809
You kindle the fire...

12:06.892 --> 12:09.437
and I'll show you
something wonderful...

12:09.520 --> 12:10.896
a big ball of snow.

12:13.691 --> 12:18.571
- "Sick
on a journey, in my dream,

12:18.654 --> 12:21.907
staggering
over withered fields."

12:21.991 --> 12:23.200
- Mm.

12:25.202 --> 12:27.371
And he was dying
when he wrote that.

12:27.455 --> 12:28.873
- Yes.

12:32.042 --> 12:33.461
- To old poets...

12:34.962 --> 12:36.297
And new friends.

12:47.558 --> 12:51.145
This is your turf war.

12:51.228 --> 12:53.314
Who pays for this?

12:53.397 --> 12:56.233
- Who told you to serve
Tozawa guys?

12:56.317 --> 12:57.985
- You expect me to ask
the customers

12:58.068 --> 13:00.112
which gang they belong to?

13:00.196 --> 13:03.240
I called you
when they wouldn't pay,

13:03.324 --> 13:04.992
and then your guys
wrecked my bar!

13:05.075 --> 13:08.496
- Oyabun says he'll give you
a month's protection for free.

13:08.579 --> 13:11.165
- Protection like this?

13:12.541 --> 13:16.921
If I can't rely on Chihara-kai,
maybe I should ask Tozawa.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.680
- Who told you to hit him?

13:26.764 --> 13:28.766
- He said he was going
to switch to Tozawa.

13:28.849 --> 13:29.517
- That was negotiating.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.186
That asshole
would never switch.

13:32.269 --> 13:34.146
He knows I'd kill him.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.901
You having trouble?

13:41.028 --> 13:42.112
- With what?

13:42.196 --> 13:43.197
- What do you mean, with what?

13:43.280 --> 13:46.116
With this. What we do.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.035
- No.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.411
- Bullshit.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.704
You've been off lately.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.628
Remember when I found you
in that arcade in Meguro?

13:58.712 --> 14:01.090
You stank like fish guts.

14:02.633 --> 14:06.053
Working sixteen hour days,
your life decided for you.

14:06.845 --> 14:08.722
Like every other sucker
in this country.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.101
And what'd I do?

14:12.184 --> 14:13.185
Huh?

14:15.521 --> 14:18.440
I set you free, little brother.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.109
- Hai.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.528
- You want to go back,
say the word.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.489
- I'm good.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.495
- And what happened there
in the bar?

14:31.579 --> 14:32.580
There's a time for talking
and a time for fists.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.123
Learn to know the difference.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.417
- How?

14:36.500 --> 14:37.376
- Read the air.

14:37.459 --> 14:40.421
Control yourself. Yeah?

14:40.504 --> 14:42.089
- Hai.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.883
- All right, we'll do the
pachinko place now, then...

15:07.114 --> 15:08.699
Man sets himself on fire

15:08.782 --> 15:09.950
with gasoline.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.829
So many suicides.

15:13.912 --> 15:16.373
- Welcome to Japan.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.084
- And it seems like
they're all done in public.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.754
Why?
- So the landlord does not

15:21.837 --> 15:24.381
sue your family
if you burn his building down

15:24.465 --> 15:25.466
when you set yourself on fire.

15:25.549 --> 15:29.261
- Seriously?
- It happens.

15:29.345 --> 15:30.763
- That's fucking wack.

15:31.805 --> 15:34.266
- Wack?
- Uh, bad.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.768
- "Wack" means bad?

15:36.894 --> 15:38.520
- Yes.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.648
I do not believe you.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.191
- You're wack.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.070
Get it?
- No.

15:48.072 --> 15:48.822
Meicho Shimbun. City Desk.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.450
- My paper wasn't delivered
today.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.494
Who's in charge over there?

15:53.577 --> 15:54.662
- Uh...

15:54.745 --> 15:59.917
I am very sorry.
What address?

16:00.584 --> 16:04.713
- What are you, a gaijin?
Put your supervisor on!

16:07.091 --> 16:07.841
- Maruyama-san.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.307
- How may I help you?

16:15.391 --> 16:18.519
- A woman now?
After the gaijin?

16:18.602 --> 16:19.770
Put a real employee on!

16:20.521 --> 16:23.482
- Women and gaijin are
all we have today. Thank you.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.526
I need you to go
through these scrapbooks

16:25.609 --> 16:27.986
for the last three years.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.155
Find me any articles
about single women

16:30.239 --> 16:31.907
murdered by--

16:31.990 --> 16:33.617
Meicho Shimbun!

16:38.539 --> 16:39.039
One moment.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.211
- Adelstein.

16:46.463 --> 16:47.715
Of course.

16:48.298 --> 16:51.552
Thank you.

16:51.635 --> 16:53.262
What address?

17:55.699 --> 17:56.784
- You stay behind
me, no matter what.

17:56.867 --> 17:59.870
If you hear gunfire,
hit the floor.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.517
Good morning, and thank you.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.185
My name is Makabe.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.394
- Allow us to make amends
for the altercation

19:05.477 --> 19:09.189
Nakamura caused at the bar
last night.

19:09.273 --> 19:15.445
We are also sorry the
Chihara-kai man was stabbed.

19:17.948 --> 19:20.868
Here is the man
who wielded the knife.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.911
We have banished him
from the organization.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.414
This is the document of proof.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.172
- Indeed, your man Nakamura
owned the gun

19:33.255 --> 19:36.925
in violation of the Swords
and Firearms Control Law.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.137
He did not, however,
own the bullets in it.

19:40.220 --> 19:41.680
There were two bullets.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.808
So I will be arresting
two more men.

19:47.936 --> 19:49.146
- You got some balls.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.485
Katagiri-san.

19:55.569 --> 19:56.236
That's highly irregular.

19:58.989 --> 20:01.074
- What your men did
was irregular.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.119
Drawing guns,
in a Chihara-kai bar?

20:07.122 --> 20:09.249
Start a war with Ishida

20:09.333 --> 20:12.294
and you're starting one
with me and the TMPD.

20:12.377 --> 20:15.881
- Whatever Ishida is paying
you,

20:15.964 --> 20:18.800
we'll double it.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.350
- Say that again.

20:46.036 --> 20:50.666
- I regret giving Nakamura
a bullet.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.676
- I am very regretful
of my actions.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.970
- Take them.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.359
We thank you
for your cooperation.

21:28.161 --> 21:33.583
- Hey, this is totally
harassment!

21:36.586 --> 21:38.422
- That's right!
What are the charges?

21:38.505 --> 21:39.798
Answer us!

21:46.930 --> 21:48.390
- Can I have one of those?

21:51.768 --> 21:53.103
Thank you.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.522
- No quotes from what you
heard up there.

21:55.605 --> 21:56.398
The rest is yours.

21:56.481 --> 21:58.483
The raid, the arrests
on suspicion

21:58.567 --> 22:00.819
of firearm possession,
investigation is ongoing.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.363
An exclusive.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.408
With my compliments.

22:14.124 --> 22:16.543
- One!

22:16.626 --> 22:18.170
Two!

22:18.253 --> 22:19.713
Three!

22:19.796 --> 22:21.798
- The cops took three!

22:24.676 --> 22:25.510
- Man, they went for it.

22:46.615 --> 22:47.783
- Welcome.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.910
- One beer, please.

22:49.993 --> 22:51.703
- Yes. Right away.

22:54.539 --> 22:56.041
- Read it and weep.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.045
- It's not bad work.

23:00.128 --> 23:01.588
Wow.

23:01.671 --> 23:03.548
"Gunshots in Kabukicho bar,

23:03.632 --> 23:07.052
"three Tozawa-gumi men
arrested.

23:07.135 --> 23:08.637
"Around14 a.m.
on October 4th,

23:08.720 --> 23:12.599
the Shinjuku Police--"

23:12.682 --> 23:14.101
- All right. We get it.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.937
- Come on, man.

23:17.020 --> 23:20.148
Jake's scoop got published.

23:21.983 --> 23:22.275
Hey!

23:23.527 --> 23:26.154
- How did you get
to go along with these police

23:26.238 --> 23:28.323
on an office raid of Tozawa?

23:30.283 --> 23:32.160
- Here's the thing, Tin-Tin.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.120
- Please stop calling me that.

23:33.203 --> 23:35.872
- Should we stop
calling him that?

23:35.956 --> 23:37.249
- No. We should not.

23:37.332 --> 23:40.961
- Do you know what Baku said
to me today?

23:42.212 --> 23:44.047
"Even the gaijin
writes better than you,

23:44.131 --> 23:47.509
and he is half-ape, half-Jew."

23:47.592 --> 23:49.886
I was a fucking
literature major.

23:51.388 --> 23:54.808
- First of all, I'm full Jew,
but...

23:54.891 --> 23:57.435
you're a great writer.

23:57.519 --> 24:00.105
- A really good writer.

24:00.188 --> 24:02.607
- So...

24:02.691 --> 24:04.109
fuck Baku.

24:04.734 --> 24:07.070
- Fuck Baku.

24:07.654 --> 24:08.321
- I endorse that sentiment.

24:13.451 --> 24:15.078
- Careful, man,
that glass is cracked.

24:16.329 --> 24:18.498
You hit it too hard.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.167
- Oi!

24:20.250 --> 24:23.128
- Girls, thank you for
your work.

24:24.546 --> 24:25.672
What do we sell?

24:25.755 --> 24:27.841
Hmm?

24:27.924 --> 24:28.425
Do we sell liquor?

24:30.093 --> 24:35.515
No, ladies, we sell dreams.

24:35.599 --> 24:40.854
- You go sell dreams. I'll sell
liquor and make commission.

24:40.937 --> 24:42.981
- Huh?
- Hmm?

24:44.649 --> 24:47.694
- Number one this week,
as usual, is Luna.

24:47.777 --> 24:50.405
- Show off!

24:50.488 --> 24:51.364
- Tell us your secret.

24:51.448 --> 24:52.699
- Shut up.

24:52.782 --> 24:53.575
Samantha is number two.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.745
- Ooh.

24:56.828 --> 24:59.539
- They understand
how to sell a dream.

25:00.415 --> 25:03.501
Unlike some of you...

25:03.585 --> 25:08.215
as we can all see
by this skinny envelope.

25:08.298 --> 25:12.177
No table requests,
no away-dates,

25:12.260 --> 25:15.889
because you have the grace
of a peasant.

25:15.972 --> 25:17.557
You stink of desperation.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.100
- Hey.

25:19.184 --> 25:21.102
Enough.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.691
- Polina.

25:35.158 --> 25:38.495
- I hate him.
I hate that man.

25:39.996 --> 25:42.582
- Why didn't you
tell me anything?

25:42.666 --> 25:45.418
Is he still doing this shit?
Has he done anything else?

25:48.171 --> 25:49.297
- I do what he wants,
or I'm gone.

25:49.381 --> 25:52.509
- Then fuck him.
Go do something else.

25:52.592 --> 25:54.261
- Do what?

25:54.344 --> 25:56.972
I have no degree,
no experience.

25:57.055 --> 25:59.266
My visa expired.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.976
And my family needs money.

26:01.059 --> 26:03.687
And I am their money.

26:03.770 --> 26:06.106
Without this job--
- Listen.

26:06.189 --> 26:07.649
Listen, you're gonna be okay.

26:10.277 --> 26:13.071
I got you.
Tell me next time.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.031
Okay?

26:20.954 --> 26:22.455
I'm gonna tell you something.

26:27.210 --> 26:29.254
I'm gonna start my own club.

26:32.132 --> 26:34.676
I have money saved,
but I can only--

26:34.759 --> 26:35.593
I can only bring a few girls.

26:39.139 --> 26:42.142
Look at me.
Tell no one.

26:51.901 --> 26:53.820
- Is this Dolce & Gabbana?

26:53.903 --> 26:55.822
- Who fucking cares?

26:57.073 --> 26:59.868
- Look, Malee.
Some dresses fell off a truck.

26:59.951 --> 27:01.745
I'll buy you one.
- Really?

27:01.828 --> 27:04.080
- Really?
Really?

27:05.415 --> 27:08.168
- I'm not paying
that much for this.

27:08.251 --> 27:09.586
- Prices are non-negotiable.

27:09.669 --> 27:11.713
- You didn't pay
a fucking thing.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.882
- Listen, bitch,
you pay what we say.

27:13.965 --> 27:15.216
- That's not right.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.343
- Hey!

27:18.762 --> 27:19.512
Treat these ladies
with respect.

27:19.596 --> 27:22.015
- She can't talk to me
like that--

27:22.098 --> 27:23.725
- Unhappy girls
means unhappy clients

27:23.808 --> 27:25.769
means less money kicked up
to Oyabun.

27:25.852 --> 27:27.187
You think that's fine?

27:28.938 --> 27:30.899
So shut the fuck up.

27:30.982 --> 27:32.025
- Hai.

27:33.818 --> 27:37.614
- Ladies, our apologies.
Prices will be reasonable.

27:45.538 --> 27:47.499
None are right for you.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.793
- Oh, you know my style?

27:52.212 --> 27:53.755
- I know what will look good.

27:54.130 --> 27:55.965
Come.

28:34.337 --> 28:34.671
Try it on.

29:35.648 --> 29:36.900
It's not bad.

29:42.238 --> 29:44.324
- Sold.
I'll take it.

29:48.244 --> 29:50.914
- It's not for sale.

29:50.997 --> 29:52.999
Take it off, and bring it back.

30:16.689 --> 30:19.901
- Come with me
to host club tonight.

30:19.984 --> 30:22.529
- I'm gonna go home.
- Please?

30:22.612 --> 30:24.531
- You should go home.

30:24.614 --> 30:27.200
- You don't want me
to be happy?

30:27.283 --> 30:29.077
- I'll see you tomorrow.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.370
- Okay, fine.

30:30.453 --> 30:31.788
Bye.
- Bye.

30:39.420 --> 30:40.505
- Hey.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.807
You got somewhere you gotta be?

31:10.618 --> 31:13.329
Hungry?
- Yeah.

31:13.413 --> 31:16.040
- You want to get some food?
- Yeah.

31:29.679 --> 31:32.390
- How'd you end up
working at Onyx?

31:34.309 --> 31:35.935
- This the interview part
of the dinner?

31:37.687 --> 31:39.897
- I'm just curious about,
you know,

31:39.981 --> 31:41.482
how you ended up
doing what you do.

31:43.192 --> 31:45.778
- Well, um...

31:47.363 --> 31:49.657
I started teaching English,

31:49.741 --> 31:53.077
and then I decided
to do something

31:53.161 --> 31:55.246
that gave me time
to pursue my interests.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.290
- Which are?

31:57.373 --> 32:00.960
- Which are...

32:01.044 --> 32:02.754
fucking Tokyo.

32:04.380 --> 32:06.591
Bars, karaoke bars,

32:06.674 --> 32:08.635
gorgeous onsens,
way too much manga.

32:08.718 --> 32:11.304
- Fucking love manga.
- Really?

32:11.387 --> 32:12.555
- Yeah.
"Dragon Head"?

32:12.639 --> 32:14.015
- So good.

32:14.098 --> 32:15.391
Do you know
"20th Century Boys"?

32:15.475 --> 32:17.560
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

32:17.644 --> 32:18.811
Do you listen to Kahimi Karie?

32:18.895 --> 32:21.356
- Wait, she's fucking amazing.
- So good.

32:21.439 --> 32:23.399
- You--
- Really good.

32:23.483 --> 32:25.652
"Elastic Girl,"
that's by far my favorite song.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.362
- Yeah,
that album is super cool.

32:27.445 --> 32:28.655
- Yeah, it's like,
the beginning of that song

32:28.738 --> 32:31.407
with the harmonica
and the guitar...

32:31.491 --> 32:32.700
rad.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.703
You listen to that?
- Yeah.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.205
- Wow.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.459
Okay, ask me.

32:42.669 --> 32:43.670
- What?

32:43.753 --> 32:44.921
- Dude, you've been wanting

32:45.004 --> 32:46.839
to ask since we sat down.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.760
Don't be a pussy now,
Mr. Meicho.

32:50.843 --> 32:52.470
Mr. Big Hotshot Reporter Man.

32:52.553 --> 32:54.097
- Okay, fine, if you want me
to ask you, I'll--

32:54.180 --> 32:56.224
- Fucking ask me.
- Are you a prostitute?

32:56.933 --> 33:00.561
- Like, $125 for a hand job.

33:00.645 --> 33:01.896
$375 for a blow job.

33:03.773 --> 33:04.732
Grand for a threesome.
Three grand for--

33:04.816 --> 33:06.693
- Oh, my God.
Wait, so those are--

33:06.776 --> 33:08.903
that's--
those are the real numbers?

33:08.986 --> 33:10.196
- Do you think
that I would give someone

33:10.279 --> 33:12.198
a hand job for $125?

33:14.283 --> 33:15.827
Do I look a prostitute to you?

33:15.910 --> 33:16.869
- No.
- Is that what I look like?

33:19.789 --> 33:22.542
Really sorry if that ruined
something for you.

33:24.335 --> 33:26.879
- You want
anything else? You done?

33:26.963 --> 33:30.758
- Two more beers.
We'll be here a while.

33:34.178 --> 33:35.596
- I'm just really
curious,

33:35.680 --> 33:37.056
and I'm gonna keep digging

33:37.140 --> 33:41.227
until you tell me
some more about you.

33:41.310 --> 33:43.146
- Yeah, I know.

33:43.229 --> 33:44.981
Okay.
What do you want to do?

33:45.064 --> 33:46.941
Ex-pats origin story?
- Sure.

33:47.024 --> 33:48.609
- Okay, let's do it.
- Let's do it.

33:48.693 --> 33:51.779
- Make it quick.
15 seconds or less.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.906
You go first. Ready?

33:53.990 --> 33:55.575
- Okay.
- Go.

33:55.658 --> 33:57.118
- My father, who you just
wish would shut up

33:57.201 --> 33:58.077
with the high expectations
and disown me already.

33:58.161 --> 34:00.663
My mom can't accept
that my little sister

34:00.747 --> 34:02.081
is not gonna try
to kill herself again,

34:02.165 --> 34:03.082
so every call she makes to me
is full of guilt.

34:03.166 --> 34:05.418
So yeah, I think coming here
and trying to make

34:05.501 --> 34:06.836
my own way makes a lot
of sense, don't you?

34:06.919 --> 34:09.756
Whoa.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.382
Not bad.
- Go!

34:11.466 --> 34:12.175
- Dad's a judge
turned politician,

34:12.258 --> 34:14.177
assumed I'd follow
in his footsteps,

34:14.260 --> 34:15.344
expected me to go
to law school,

34:15.428 --> 34:20.391
work on his next Senate
campaign, so he's disappointed.

34:20.475 --> 34:22.894
Mom's so hopped up on Vicodin,

34:22.977 --> 34:25.438
I doubt she's noticed I'm gone,
so...

34:25.521 --> 34:27.273
yeah, I think making my own
way here makes a lot of sense,

34:27.356 --> 34:29.275
don't you?

34:30.485 --> 34:32.779
- Come on.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.448
That's a great story,

34:35.531 --> 34:36.991
but that's not your story.

34:40.536 --> 34:42.163
Tell me one real thing.

34:49.837 --> 34:52.048
- I haven't talked to my family
in four years.

34:57.136 --> 34:57.845
Anything else?

34:57.929 --> 35:03.434
- We're still hungry.
Surprise us.

35:49.438 --> 35:52.859
- We hope Chairman Tanaka
is in good health.

35:52.942 --> 35:57.321
- Yes. For a man of eighty,
he has extraordinary stamina.

36:04.787 --> 36:07.164
- As you may know,

36:09.625 --> 36:12.211
the upcoming conference...

36:12.295 --> 36:15.631
will include a number
of foreign dignitaries

36:15.715 --> 36:19.051
visiting Tokyo.

36:19.135 --> 36:23.890
So the TMPD would like
to keep things uneventful.

36:32.148 --> 36:33.149
- How many we be of
assistance?

36:51.918 --> 36:54.378
- They didn't drink the tea.

36:57.298 --> 36:58.257
Again.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.721
- Oyabun is fucking us!

37:03.804 --> 37:05.598
Damn it.

37:11.479 --> 37:12.563
I apologize for my rudeness.

37:13.522 --> 37:14.690
- Any more talk of this,
and I will punish

37:14.774 --> 37:16.108
every one of you.

37:17.360 --> 37:20.321
Your life, your future,
is protected by your Oyabun.

37:21.864 --> 37:24.951
And you question his loyalty?

37:33.376 --> 37:38.297
Three Tozawa-Gumi men arrested.

37:38.381 --> 37:40.299
- Your last tape
was lame and short.

37:40.383 --> 37:42.760
Seriously, what are you
spending time doing

37:42.843 --> 37:46.347
instead of--oh.

37:46.430 --> 37:49.141
Oh!
You're getting laid.

37:49.225 --> 37:52.395
I have lost you
to "hide the sausage"?

37:52.478 --> 37:53.270
Oh, wait.
My bad.

37:53.354 --> 37:57.525
It's still you
we're talking about.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.568
I know I made you laugh,
pea brain.

37:59.652 --> 38:02.071
Put down your book and call me
every now and then.

38:02.154 --> 38:07.243
I need you,
and I miss your face.

38:25.386 --> 38:29.140
- Hey, did you
remember to flush this time?

38:29.223 --> 38:30.808
- Shut up.

38:41.110 --> 38:44.655
- Sato likes to fuck
in the bathroom.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.910
He banged that gaijin bitch
from Onyx last night

38:49.994 --> 38:52.663
last night in the toilet.

38:55.124 --> 38:57.209
- What the fuck
are you talking about?

38:57.293 --> 38:59.920
- I saw you disappear with her
in the back.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.297
- To sell her a dress.

39:02.882 --> 39:05.718
Yeah, I'd deny it too.

39:06.802 --> 39:08.512
The bitch is filthy.

39:10.806 --> 39:12.433
- That true, Sato?

39:12.516 --> 39:13.267
- Hell, yeah it's true.

39:13.350 --> 39:17.063
She's a whore.
She'll fuck anyplace.

39:17.146 --> 39:18.814
- Sato! You gonna take that?

39:18.898 --> 39:20.232
- You gonna let him say that?

39:22.359 --> 39:24.236
All I'm saying is...

39:24.320 --> 39:27.907
If I was lying,
he'd fucking do something.

39:58.312 --> 39:58.354
- Oi.

40:00.064 --> 40:02.108
You coming?

40:36.225 --> 40:39.019
- Whoo!

41:12.553 --> 41:13.846
- That's enough!

41:16.891 --> 41:18.100
Oi!

41:26.066 --> 41:28.194
You're done now.

41:48.964 --> 41:50.841
- Forgive me.

42:00.935 --> 42:02.978
- You are no better
than a wild beast!

42:08.901 --> 42:10.402
You put one of your own
brothers in the hospital!

42:15.032 --> 42:16.909
What were you thinking?

42:18.285 --> 42:19.620
Do you want to lose
your finger?

42:19.703 --> 42:21.205
- Forgive me, Oyabun.

42:24.208 --> 42:24.625
Forgive me.

42:29.964 --> 42:31.674
I cannot make up for your loss.

42:33.926 --> 42:35.052
But perhaps...

42:38.681 --> 42:40.432
I can bring you
something better.

42:46.063 --> 42:47.523
- What do you mean?

42:54.488 --> 42:57.449
- Hello Katagiri-san.

42:57.533 --> 43:00.786
- Hello Tengu!
Come plant with me!

43:02.079 --> 43:03.247
- Oh, hai.

43:06.458 --> 43:09.962
Jake-san, "he who does not
work, neither shall he eat."

43:10.045 --> 43:11.547
- Of course.

43:11.630 --> 43:13.340
- Why don't you set your
bags down first?

43:13.424 --> 43:14.550
- Oh, hai.

43:19.888 --> 43:21.515
Beautiful.

43:23.434 --> 43:25.602
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

43:25.686 --> 43:26.979
- Delicious.

43:27.062 --> 43:28.147
- Yummy.

43:28.230 --> 43:30.107
- Yummy, right?

43:31.400 --> 43:32.860
- Eat slowly!

43:33.485 --> 43:35.279
- It's falling apart!

43:35.738 --> 43:37.823
- How long will you stay
in Japan before you go home?

43:38.782 --> 43:42.077
- This is my home now.

43:45.748 --> 43:48.709
- Thank you.
That was delicious.

43:50.252 --> 43:53.464
- Girls, your father
is very brave.

43:53.547 --> 43:55.215
- We know.
- We know.

43:55.299 --> 43:57.509
- And generous.

43:57.593 --> 44:01.138
He did a very kind thing
for me.

44:02.681 --> 44:04.892
And I am very grateful.

44:17.488 --> 44:19.531
- Your article was good.

44:22.076 --> 44:23.744
What you chose not to say,
it was--

44:23.827 --> 44:25.496
- Edited brutally.

44:25.579 --> 44:28.582
- Then your editor is a man
of wisdom and discretion.

44:28.665 --> 44:32.378
- A woman, and yeah.

44:32.461 --> 44:34.213
She might be.
- Mm.

44:40.094 --> 44:42.054
- Where did you get this?

44:42.137 --> 44:44.681
- I witnessed a man light
himself on fire with them.

44:45.474 --> 44:48.769
I already interviewed his wife.

44:48.852 --> 44:49.645
He was being threatened.

44:52.147 --> 44:53.941
- "Isn't your
family ashamed of you?

44:54.024 --> 44:55.025
Why aren't you dead?"

44:56.860 --> 44:59.405
Another man was
stabbed for the same reason.

44:59.488 --> 45:01.115
- A loan-sharking business,
right?

45:01.198 --> 45:04.326
- Yeah, but I cannot pursue it.

45:04.410 --> 45:07.204
- Why?
- It's...

45:07.287 --> 45:09.248
complicated.
- Complicated?

45:09.331 --> 45:12.584
- It is yakuza business.
- I figured.

45:12.668 --> 45:16.255
- But which family or group
within that family--

45:16.338 --> 45:18.465
almost impossible to know.

45:20.217 --> 45:21.427
- Why?

45:22.886 --> 45:26.098
- This logo.
It's smoke.

45:26.181 --> 45:27.933
These companies move
constantly--

45:28.016 --> 45:31.687
change numbers,
open and close their stores.

45:31.770 --> 45:35.190
So by the time a cop
or reporter finds an address--

45:35.274 --> 45:35.941
- It's gone.
I know.

45:36.024 --> 45:37.776
I--I saw.

45:40.654 --> 45:44.908
So how do we find them?

45:44.992 --> 45:46.785
And get them?

45:52.040 --> 45:55.419
- All companies get
a registration number

45:55.502 --> 45:57.337
when they're established.

45:57.421 --> 45:58.714
No matter how many times
a company moves,

45:58.797 --> 46:00.299
that number doesn't change.

46:01.884 --> 46:02.843
The registration number.

46:02.926 --> 46:05.429
With this you could dig
until you found the man

46:05.512 --> 46:07.139
who started it.

46:10.017 --> 46:11.310
I can be fired

46:11.393 --> 46:13.812
if I share evidence with
a reporter.

46:13.896 --> 46:15.063
I'm sorry.

46:17.232 --> 46:19.234
I need to put my daughters
to bed.

46:40.214 --> 46:41.006
Hey, tengu!

46:41.089 --> 46:42.841
- Hmm?

46:42.925 --> 46:48.263
- When my father was out,
I removed this from his drawer.

46:48.347 --> 46:53.727
So he has not breached the
National Public Service Act.

46:55.229 --> 46:56.772
But I am very ashamed!

47:02.736 --> 47:04.488
Thanks for the doll!

47:05.322 --> 47:06.865
- Thanks.

47:21.630 --> 47:23.423
DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE

47:49.074 --> 47:50.951
- May I leave a message
for him, please?

47:51.285 --> 47:53.287
Yes.

47:54.329 --> 47:57.291
I can meet Detective Soma
anywhere, anytime,

47:57.374 --> 48:00.085
at his convenience.

48:00.168 --> 48:02.170
- When is fucking dinner?

48:02.254 --> 48:02.796
- Five minutes!

48:03.672 --> 48:05.299
Sorry about that.

48:05.382 --> 48:06.466
Ah.
Ah, hai.

48:06.550 --> 48:08.927
My name is Emi Maruyama.

48:09.011 --> 48:10.429
Yes.

48:10.512 --> 48:13.849
Thank you so much.

48:15.017 --> 48:15.976
Don't raise your
voice when I'm on the phone!

48:21.690 --> 48:22.691
- And then what did you say?

48:22.774 --> 48:26.987
Oh, my God.
No, I had an awful day.

48:27.070 --> 48:29.656
I was with a realtor
for five fucking hours,

48:29.740 --> 48:33.118
up and down stairs
all over Tokyo.

48:33.201 --> 48:35.954
Nothing.

48:36.038 --> 48:37.623
Oh, and you won't believe this.

48:37.706 --> 48:41.376
They say I have
to have a guarantor.

48:41.460 --> 48:43.462
Pol, did you borrow my--
oh, no.

48:43.545 --> 48:44.296
I found it.
Here it is.

48:44.379 --> 48:47.049
Sorry.
I found it.

48:47.132 --> 48:49.468
A guarantor--
uh, a man to say

48:49.551 --> 48:51.470
that I'm good for it
to the bank.

48:51.553 --> 48:54.181
Uh, no, I'll be there soon.

48:54.264 --> 48:57.434
Keep an eye on Malee for me.
Ciao, Polina bella.

49:55.200 --> 49:55.450
Good evening.

49:55.534 --> 49:57.911
- For two.

49:57.994 --> 49:59.079
- Two?
- Yes.

49:59.162 --> 50:01.707
- All right.
- Two beers, please.

50:01.790 --> 50:03.041
- Okay.
- Thank you.

50:11.341 --> 50:12.551
- Hello.

50:12.634 --> 50:13.802
- Welcome.

50:19.307 --> 50:22.269
- Everything all
right back there with that guy?

50:22.352 --> 50:25.230
- Which guy?

50:25.313 --> 50:26.690
- In the alley.

50:28.650 --> 50:31.278
- You're mistaken.

50:31.361 --> 50:33.363
I was alone.

50:34.406 --> 50:35.949
- Okay.

50:47.627 --> 50:50.088
Where's Tin-Tin?

50:50.172 --> 50:53.091
- Running late.
He'll meet us at the cages.

50:53.175 --> 50:55.594
- I got something
I want to show you guys.

50:55.677 --> 50:56.803
- What?

50:58.013 --> 50:59.306
Thank you.

51:01.516 --> 51:03.518
- Pfft!

51:03.602 --> 51:04.936
- Strike!

51:05.020 --> 51:06.396
- Okay, okay, okay.

51:07.898 --> 51:09.691
Fuck.

51:09.775 --> 51:11.651
- I'm expecting
more out of you, American.

51:13.945 --> 51:15.447
Pss!

51:15.530 --> 51:17.324
- Man, you suck.

51:17.407 --> 51:18.700
- Pfft!

51:23.872 --> 51:25.957
No, the question is--

51:26.041 --> 51:27.375
Is, who's the person
behind these

51:27.459 --> 51:28.752
scumbag loan-shark companies?

51:28.835 --> 51:30.212
- Who do you think it might be?

51:32.380 --> 51:33.089
- Well, I don't know,
but I think that we have

51:33.173 --> 51:35.383
enough information
in that folder

51:35.467 --> 51:37.427
to give us a pretty good lead.

51:41.264 --> 51:42.682
- You could play
for the Hanshin Tigers.

51:42.766 --> 51:44.643
- Fuck you very much.

51:44.726 --> 51:46.019
- You're welcome.

51:58.907 --> 52:00.450
- Whoa.

52:04.746 --> 52:06.623
Hey!

52:07.749 --> 52:08.834
Damn.

52:10.752 --> 52:13.213
- Jesus, you ever miss?

52:13.296 --> 52:15.507
- What kind of American
loves yakuza

52:15.590 --> 52:18.176
but doesn't know
how to swing a bat?

52:25.100 --> 52:27.185
Two more swings and it's yours.

52:28.311 --> 52:31.481
- Not interested.
Baseball is prosaic.

52:32.607 --> 52:34.442
- What can I do--

52:35.277 --> 52:35.735
- You're playing. Come on.

52:35.819 --> 52:37.821
No.

52:37.904 --> 52:38.113
- Why not?

52:41.283 --> 52:43.451
- He doesn't know
how to have fun.

52:43.535 --> 52:44.244
- Yeah, you don't.
- No, come on, no.

52:44.327 --> 52:46.204
- Don't be a party pooper.
- What?

52:46.288 --> 52:48.248
- Who is Aderu-stein?

52:50.792 --> 52:53.837
- No one here with that name.

52:57.382 --> 52:58.508
- You come with us.

52:59.801 --> 53:01.469
- I'm sorry?

53:01.553 --> 53:03.221
- We're gonna
take a drive. Now.

53:03.305 --> 53:04.890
- I'm telling you,
I don't speak Japanese.

53:04.973 --> 53:05.724
- We told you
to come with us!

53:05.807 --> 53:07.893
- Who the fuck are you?

53:07.976 --> 53:08.852
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

53:08.935 --> 53:10.395
Okay! Okay!

53:10.478 --> 53:11.646
Okay, I'll come!

53:11.730 --> 53:12.731
Okay!

53:17.319 --> 53:18.778
- My jacket...

53:20.989 --> 53:22.782
You okay?
- I'm good.

53:26.995 --> 53:29.164
- Don't follow us.
