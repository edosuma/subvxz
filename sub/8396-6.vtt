00:02.000 --> 00:05.680
We can make this work.
You don't know what I've done!

00:05.720 --> 00:09.640
I don't want to hurt you.
That's not what I'm here for.
I want to trust him.

00:09.640 --> 00:12.080
Ian Reed's here. He's got a gun...
No!

00:15.440 --> 00:16.920
Zo?

00:16.920 --> 00:19.040
No!

00:21.920 --> 00:23.160
Zo?

00:25.520 --> 00:28.880
This programme contains
some violent scenes.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.880
What have you done, Ian?

00:38.920 --> 00:43.720
'You have one new message.
Ruth, Ruth, it's me, it's me, Luther!

00:43.720 --> 00:47.320
'It's Ian, I think he's hurt her.
Send a medic. Please.

00:47.320 --> 00:49.280
'Just send a medic over there now!'

00:55.800 --> 00:56.840
You were right.

00:58.840 --> 01:00.680
Poor bastard.

01:00.680 --> 01:02.480
Poor bastard, my arse. Poor Zoe!

Argh...

01:48.240 --> 01:52.000
Arrrrgh!

01:56.160 --> 01:57.440
Arrrgh!

02:30.480 --> 02:31.760
What's happening here?

02:31.760 --> 02:34.160
And you are, sir?
Mark North. Where's Zoe?

02:38.960 --> 02:40.760
Ah, Jesus God.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.600
No, no, no...

03:51.040 --> 03:55.400
What's going on? About an hour
ago we received a 999 call.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.920
Gunshots heard,
23 Parthenial Street.

03:57.960 --> 04:00.520
First responders found a woman dead.

04:00.520 --> 04:03.480
Single gunshot wound. Zoe Luther.

04:06.600 --> 04:09.960
No... Don't speak up for him, Justin.
Not yet.

04:09.960 --> 04:13.760
He argued with her. That doesn't
mean he did it. He was there.

04:13.760 --> 04:18.920
His fingerprints are all over
the place, in his wife's blood.
She's murdered. He's in the wind...

04:22.240 --> 04:23.960
What does that tell you?

04:23.960 --> 04:25.840
He wouldn't do it. He wouldn't do it.

04:25.840 --> 04:31.360
Painful as it may be,
I'm afraid the evidence
currently tells us otherwise.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.480
You ready?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.080
Ready.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.600
First thing to know,
we're in damage control.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.840
We keep an airtight lid on this
until it's resolved.

04:54.840 --> 04:58.280
That means no press,
no briefings and no leaks.

04:58.280 --> 05:01.040
Well, the press will get there
soon enough.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.760
Which is why we need Luther
in custody without delay.

05:03.760 --> 05:07.600
I don't want any "Killer policeman
at large" headlines. Are we clear?

05:07.600 --> 05:10.320
Teller is in charge
of the investigation, but, er,

05:10.320 --> 05:13.200
Martin will be assisting, heavily.

05:13.200 --> 05:17.520
Give him your absolute co-operation. 
You need one of us on the ground,
to advise.

05:17.520 --> 05:20.120
Someone who knows him.
Yeah? And should that be you?

05:20.120 --> 05:25.520
Absolutely. It should be me. Yeah.
Right, so, do you believe
John Luther shot his wife tonight?

05:26.960 --> 05:30.440
I can't be sure.
Not yet. It's just too early...

05:30.440 --> 05:35.040
Exactly. The last thing I need
is for this operation to be hindered
by your loyalty.

05:35.040 --> 05:38.320
DS Ripley, you'll assist
Detective Chief Superintendent...

05:38.320 --> 05:41.440
Oh, well, with respect -
sorry, Justin - but Ripley...

05:41.440 --> 05:45.720
He may not know Luther as well
as you, but he's a damn sight
better placed to be non-partisan.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.480
You, you remain here,
you can advise as necessary.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.040
Sorry, I think that's a mistake.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.320
I'm not interested
in saving John Luther.

05:53.320 --> 05:56.200
I want the full force of the law
stamping down on his face

05:56.200 --> 05:59.120
before sunrise,
and I want your help to do it.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.040
Are we clear on that?

06:02.040 --> 06:05.520
Good. Then let's bring him in.

MOBILE PHONE RINGS

06:51.480 --> 06:52.520
MESSAGE TONE BEEP

06:52.520 --> 06:54.280
I know what you did, Ian.

06:54.280 --> 06:58.760
You tried to make it look like
I killed her because you think,

06:58.760 --> 07:01.240
if they're coming for me,
I can't come for you.

07:01.240 --> 07:04.200
Well, you're wrong.
I am coming for you.

07:04.200 --> 07:08.040
All I have to do is stay free
long enough to see you dead.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.040
And I'll do that, Ian.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.960
I'll see you dead.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.960
'I'll see you dead.'

07:35.000 --> 07:36.800
Justin. Justin?

07:36.800 --> 07:38.600
Hey.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.240
What do you think?

07:41.240 --> 07:44.280
I don't know what to think.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.840
Yeah, me neither.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.880
Thing is, though,
if he didn't do it,

07:47.880 --> 07:49.960
where the hell is he?

07:50.880 --> 07:53.920
Perhaps he knows who did
it and he's gone after them.

07:53.920 --> 07:56.880
Whatever happens, all right,

07:56.880 --> 07:59.240
if you hear from him,

07:59.240 --> 08:01.000
you contact me, OK?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.760
Not Teller, not Schenk.

08:03.760 --> 08:06.240
Me. He needs his friends.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.640
Yeah, of course.

08:24.520 --> 08:25.880
PHONE BEEPS

08:29.520 --> 08:31.120
I'm sorry for your loss.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.039
I didn't lose her.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.480
She was taken from me.

08:37.039 --> 08:38.120
You know why?

08:39.679 --> 08:43.000
The truth is, we're not here
to talk "why". That comes later.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.240
Right now, it's all about "who".

08:45.240 --> 08:47.600
Meaning John Luther.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.920
That is a possibility.
It's something we're looking into.

08:50.920 --> 08:53.400
Oh, I can't tell you the time,
since I met Zoe,

08:53.400 --> 08:56.000
I've had to talk about this guy,
John. John, John,

08:56.000 --> 08:59.120
poor John. Needy John. Broken John.

09:00.680 --> 09:03.360
I need to know anything
that might have happened between

09:03.360 --> 09:05.880
John Luther and Zoe,
over the last few days...

09:05.880 --> 09:07.800
They were seeing each other. Seeing?

09:07.800 --> 09:09.920
Yep, sleeping together.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.840
When did you find out?

09:13.840 --> 09:17.400
Look, I stayed with friends tonight.
You've only got to ask them.

09:17.400 --> 09:21.560
We know where you were. When did
you find out about John and Zoe?

09:23.080 --> 09:24.960
About a day and a half ago.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.880
I said to her, "Choose.
Choose between us,

09:29.880 --> 09:31.600
"but stick with your choice.

09:33.960 --> 09:37.320
And she chose me.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.880
She chose me...

09:41.160 --> 09:43.840
..and she paid for it.

09:43.840 --> 09:47.160
If that turns out to be the case,
you must never blame yourself.

09:47.160 --> 09:52.480
If you pull the trigger on another
human being, the responsibility
for that is yours and yours alone.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.280
If John killed Zoe,

09:56.280 --> 09:58.800
I will not rest until I see him
punished for it.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.720
If you'll excuse me.

10:04.720 --> 10:08.040
I'll have another officer come
and take an official statement.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.080
Sorry, I, um...

10:22.080 --> 10:24.360
No, no, it's me.

10:24.360 --> 10:26.960
Sorry, I'm miles away.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.600
Is this actually happening?

10:34.640 --> 10:38.200
No. In a few minutes, I'll wake up
and my alarm's going to go off.

10:38.200 --> 10:43.640
By the time I get in to work, I'll
have forgotten I ever dreamt it.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.960
Um, he, he just called me.

10:47.960 --> 10:49.640
Who?

10:49.640 --> 10:52.520
Who'd you think? When? Just now.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.320
What did he say? Where is he?

10:54.320 --> 10:56.280
He just said that I did it. Again.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.080
Oh, Ian.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.240
'I know what you did, Ian.

11:00.240 --> 11:03.440
'You're trying to make it look
like I killed her,

11:03.440 --> 11:06.360
'because you think
if they're coming for me,

11:06.360 --> 11:09.760
'then I can't come for you.
Well, you're wrong.'

11:11.280 --> 11:14.080
I just don't understand it.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.400
Why would he project it onto me?

11:17.920 --> 11:19.400
I don't know what to do.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.040
I'm telling you this -
it feels like I'm...

11:22.040 --> 11:24.800
betraying him, you know?

11:24.800 --> 11:27.920
It doesn't matter, now you've told
me. See if you can track the phone,

11:27.920 --> 11:29.680
get a lead on where he might be.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.920
Yeah, OK. If we can pin this
mess on mental illness,

11:32.920 --> 11:36.400
then I can't be held accountable
and the unit might survive.

11:36.400 --> 11:39.880
OK, all right. Wow, I hadn't
really thought of that.

11:39.880 --> 11:42.080
You don't have to think like that.
I do.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.040
I should never have taken him back.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.360
Oh, I knew the risk!

11:50.280 --> 11:53.200
God knows they warned me,
"He's nitro glycerine."

11:53.200 --> 11:55.680
I didn't listen, because I was
so bent on making it work.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.600
I just so wanted to make it work!

11:57.600 --> 11:58.640
Boss.

11:58.640 --> 12:00.520
It's not your fault.

12:02.240 --> 12:03.760
It's not your fault.

12:10.040 --> 12:12.080
SHE SOBS

12:20.320 --> 12:21.440
CLICK

13:21.160 --> 13:24.800
If you wanted a key,
all you had to do was ask.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.920
I didn't think you slept.

13:32.920 --> 13:36.960
Oh, only lightly
and not for very long.

13:36.960 --> 13:39.320
Why are you here?

13:39.320 --> 13:41.760
I just needed a place to think.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.280
About what?

13:51.640 --> 13:53.320
Zoe's dead.

13:54.840 --> 13:57.480
Are we speaking figuratively?

13:57.480 --> 13:59.440
No.

14:00.520 --> 14:02.720
Did you kill her?

14:02.720 --> 14:05.480
Would it matter? To me?

14:07.360 --> 14:10.200
Well, it's nice to see you
retain your sense of humour.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.080
I mean it.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.840
Well, I liked her.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.800
But if you killed her,
I'm sure you had a reason.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.480
Well, I didn't.

14:23.480 --> 14:24.960
Fine.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.120
Who did?

15:02.120 --> 15:07.680
He only smashed symbols of her
relationship with this new chap.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.720
Makes for a very intimate scene.

15:13.680 --> 15:17.640
And we know that he
smashes things when he's angry.

15:17.640 --> 15:22.000
All of which tends to align us
in Luther's direction.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
Unless this was
staged for our benefit.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.680
By whom?

15:27.680 --> 15:29.520
Mr North?

15:29.520 --> 15:31.920
It's worth considering, surely.

15:31.920 --> 15:34.040
Well, even if he
didn't have an alibi,

15:34.040 --> 15:38.920
when a man stages a murder scene,
he tends to make it look like

15:38.920 --> 15:41.320
how he thinks it should.

15:41.320 --> 15:44.400
It's always wrong.
But this scene is...

15:44.400 --> 15:48.200
consistent with the thesis.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.720
To stage such a scene...

15:50.720 --> 15:56.440
correctly, would require
a very chilly heart.

15:56.440 --> 16:00.520
Which doesn't seem
compatible with a crime of rage.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.080
But it's not right.

16:03.280 --> 16:06.080
Tell me how.

16:06.080 --> 16:09.800
This kind of killing -
jealous husband, sex,
rage and all the rest of it.

16:09.800 --> 16:14.040
You'd expect a knife,
a bludgeon of some kind. A fist.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.600
Not a gun.

16:15.600 --> 16:19.520
You don't like the choice of weapon,
so that makes Luther innocent?

16:19.520 --> 16:21.040
I want him to be innocent.

16:21.040 --> 16:24.280
But, if he's not, then I'll do my
job properly and without hesitation.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.960
That's a very brave answer.

16:25.960 --> 16:29.160
It's not supposed to be.
It's just the way it is.

16:29.160 --> 16:32.680
So...are you going to kill him?

16:34.640 --> 16:36.160
I've thought about it.

16:38.280 --> 16:40.920
That's all I've thought about.

16:40.920 --> 16:43.880
Then why are you here?

16:43.880 --> 16:46.240
I just need a safe place to think.

16:51.360 --> 16:56.720
You know, in 1988, two psychologists
published an article

16:56.720 --> 16:59.400
arguing
that "positive self-deception"

16:59.400 --> 17:03.760
is a normal and advantageous part
of most people's lives.

17:03.760 --> 17:09.000
It turns out, people lie to
themselves about three things.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.280
They view themselves in
implausibly positive ways,

17:12.280 --> 17:15.440
they think they have
far more control over their lives

17:15.440 --> 17:18.240
than they actually do,

17:18.240 --> 17:21.520
and they believe the future
will be better than

17:21.520 --> 17:25.040
the evidence of the present can
possibly justify.

17:25.040 --> 17:29.520
But you're way beyond that now.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.600
You're on the other side
of that particular mirror.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.960
Lying to yourself...

17:34.960 --> 17:38.000
isn't going to help any more.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.480
So, please,

17:40.480 --> 17:42.520
tell me again.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.360
Why are you here?

17:47.640 --> 17:50.440
Alice, I need you to help me.

17:50.440 --> 17:54.360
You're asking me
to be your accomplice?

17:54.360 --> 17:55.880
Yes.

17:57.400 --> 17:59.120
Excellent.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.480
Where do we start?

18:01.480 --> 18:04.240
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

18:04.240 --> 18:05.280
Hello?

18:05.280 --> 18:08.080
'Justin. Can you talk?'

18:09.880 --> 18:12.520
Er, absolutely, yeah, I can talk.

18:12.520 --> 18:15.080
'You at the house?' Er, yeah.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.080
It wasn't me.

18:17.080 --> 18:19.920
Yeah, I know, I think.

18:19.920 --> 18:22.440
If Luther was going to do
something like this,

18:22.440 --> 18:24.920
he'd make it look like
Mark North did it.

18:24.920 --> 18:28.160
'He might be insane, but he's not
stupid.' You're a good man, Justin.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.680
So where are you right now?

18:29.680 --> 18:32.520
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.840
I don't doubt it. Any info your end?

18:34.840 --> 18:40.160
No, I'm not going to compromise
you more than I have to, OK?

18:40.160 --> 18:44.040
But don't trust Ian Reed.

18:44.040 --> 18:47.160
Sorry, it's a bit clattery
over here. Can you repeat that?

18:47.160 --> 18:48.360
Don't trust Ian Reed.

18:51.120 --> 18:54.680
Um, can you run the details by me?
'Not now.'

18:54.680 --> 18:58.360
Who is that? Um, one moment.
Telephone intelligence.

18:58.360 --> 19:00.240
Trace on Luther's phone. No news.

19:03.440 --> 19:07.000
Um, OK, I'm going to need
a brief precis of what you've got.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.040
Soon as you like.

19:08.040 --> 19:10.560
Well, as soon as there's time,
I will explain.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.600
We may have found the gun.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.640
Did you get that? I got that.

19:25.440 --> 19:26.800
Got it.

19:31.080 --> 19:33.040
It's a 9mm Beretta.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.960
Pass it to me
and I'll clear the chamber.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.760
Chamber clear. Bag it.

19:45.120 --> 19:48.600
Forensics in the house
are circumstantial.
This gun is hard evidence.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.640
And I don't want it
contaminated or "going missing"

19:51.640 --> 19:54.040
as a consequence of some
police officer's

19:54.040 --> 19:56.400
misguided sense of loyalty.
Seriously?

19:56.400 --> 19:57.440
They're good men,

19:57.440 --> 20:00.200
but sometimes goodness attracts
its own temptations.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.720
'So what do we do?'

20:02.720 --> 20:06.360
'Well, first rule of evidence -

20:06.360 --> 20:08.440
'limit the amount of transfers.'

20:08.440 --> 20:10.160
Take it to the lab ourselves.

20:26.840 --> 20:27.880
They found it.

20:27.880 --> 20:30.640
Found what?

20:30.640 --> 20:31.840
The gun.

20:32.840 --> 20:36.640
You didn't pull the trigger,
it doesn't matter.
It's got no value as evidence.

20:36.640 --> 20:40.040
No, but if Ian Reed left a gun,
he left it for a reason.

20:40.040 --> 20:42.120
Meaning?

20:42.120 --> 20:43.480
There was a gun.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.960
There was a gun, I touched it,
I gave it to him.

20:45.960 --> 20:51.040
It's got my fingerprints all over it.
If that's the gun he used on Zoe...

20:51.040 --> 20:52.800
my fingerprints are all he needs.

20:52.800 --> 20:56.000
And so? So it's on its way to
ballistic testing,

20:56.000 --> 20:57.600
fingerprint analysis,

20:57.600 --> 20:59.640
DNA analysis.

20:59.640 --> 21:04.360
Well, if that happens,
it's over for you. If that happens.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.840
But it's not going to happen.

21:21.960 --> 21:26.080
They're leaving from there, taking
the evidence to there. We're here.

21:26.080 --> 21:30.320
We can get there before them
as long as Schenk doesn't use
the blues and twos.

21:31.840 --> 21:35.200
What do you know about stealing cars?
Nothing. Doesn't matter.

21:35.200 --> 21:39.800
Because I know
everything about stealing cars.
Did you get anything for my...

21:41.200 --> 21:42.600
Hmm, thank you.

21:42.600 --> 21:45.920
They'll know it's you.
You're not an easy man to disguise.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.920
That's not the point.
Well, what is?

21:47.920 --> 21:49.800
Deniability.

21:49.800 --> 21:53.560
Look, if we get caught...
I say you forced me to help.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.120
You threatened my life.

21:55.120 --> 21:58.120
You're not even joking, are you?
Absolutely not.

21:58.120 --> 22:00.360
HE SIGHS

22:00.360 --> 22:02.320
What's wrong?

22:02.320 --> 22:05.880
Do you ever step outside yourself,
wonder what you're doing

22:05.880 --> 22:07.480
and think you've gone mad?

22:08.480 --> 22:10.240
No.

22:12.360 --> 22:15.040
Look, you and I

22:15.040 --> 22:17.080
are who we are.

22:18.760 --> 22:21.680
You need to know this.
Of all the people in the world,

22:21.680 --> 22:23.080
I will never betray you.

22:31.360 --> 22:33.400
We're on Iron Road.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.080
'Should be around 20 minutes.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.560
'Over.'

22:53.880 --> 22:54.920
TYRES SCREECH

22:57.560 --> 22:58.840
Are you armed?

22:58.840 --> 23:03.200
No. You?
No. Urgent assistance required.
Repeat - urgent assistance required.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.880
Where is it?

23:16.880 --> 23:18.920
In the glove box. Glove box? Yeah.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.480
Wait, hit me.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.840
What? You've got to hit me, you've
got to make it look right. Go on.

23:33.920 --> 23:38.040
This will achieve nothing. You're
not acting in a reasonable way.

23:53.720 --> 23:56.320
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

23:57.680 --> 23:59.200
Justin. What's happening?

24:00.200 --> 24:01.960
He took the gun.

24:03.120 --> 24:05.760
What do you mean?
What do you mean, "he took the gun"?

24:05.760 --> 24:10.000
'We were taking it to the lab.
He intercepted us,
DCI Schenk and me.' Shit.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.640
All right.

24:13.640 --> 24:15.880
OK, you listen to me.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.680
You need to come in.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.560
All right?

24:19.560 --> 24:22.480
We need to start facing facts.
What do you mean?

24:22.480 --> 24:25.440
I mean, he's not behaving
like an innocent man, is he?

24:53.440 --> 24:55.080
Why did you do it?

24:55.080 --> 24:56.760
Do what?

24:58.320 --> 24:59.720
Your parents.

25:02.240 --> 25:05.000
Because I wanted to.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.320
How could you want that?

25:08.000 --> 25:11.800
Well, let's put Ian Reed
in a room with you
and then talk about who wants what.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.480
Are you sure
you don't want to keep this?

25:21.000 --> 25:23.320
No.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.960
No guns.

25:26.880 --> 25:27.920
Suit yourself.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.320
Maintenance!

MOBILE PHONE RINGS

26:36.520 --> 26:38.240
It's him.

26:46.400 --> 26:47.840
What do you want, Ian?

26:47.840 --> 26:49.480
I just want to talk.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.200
'You sound scared. Are you scared?'

26:56.480 --> 26:59.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm scared.
'Yeah, you should be.'

27:00.760 --> 27:02.320
You should be scared.

27:03.840 --> 27:07.600
'I can't handle this.
I can't deal with this, John.'

27:07.600 --> 27:09.440
It's in my brain.

27:11.920 --> 27:14.440
'It's like my head's
full of spiders.'

27:14.440 --> 27:17.200
I can't stand it.
I think I'm going mad.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.080
Honestly, mate. I can't stand it...

27:19.080 --> 27:21.720
That's not going to stop me
coming for you.

27:21.720 --> 27:23.960
Look, I can't undo it.

27:26.120 --> 27:27.720
All right? I wish I could.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.560
Hand to God...

27:33.160 --> 27:36.000
..if I could go back,
I'd rather it was me that was dead.

27:38.200 --> 27:40.440
'I'd rather be dead
than go through this.'

27:43.120 --> 27:45.280
That can be arranged...

27:45.280 --> 27:46.560
'Ian.'

27:53.760 --> 27:55.760
Listen, just meet me, OK?

27:55.760 --> 27:58.720
'Please.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.280
'Just, er, just hear
what I've got to say.

28:03.120 --> 28:06.200
'And then, after that,
whatever happens is in your hands.'

28:07.720 --> 28:09.960
All right then.

28:09.960 --> 28:12.320
Nine o'clock.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.000
Faraday Memorial.

28:21.040 --> 28:23.320
You're not going to do
what he wants?

28:23.320 --> 28:24.840
Yes, I am.

28:44.360 --> 28:45.800
Should you be at home?

28:45.800 --> 28:47.800
It's just cracked a rib.
I'll be fine.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.160
OK.

28:49.160 --> 28:52.920
Do we have any idea of
the accomplice's ID, the woman?

28:52.920 --> 28:55.240
Um, I don't know. Young, white.

28:55.240 --> 28:58.040
Slim build. Also wore a stocking.

28:58.040 --> 29:01.240
She didn't speak?
Neither of them spoke.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.080
But it was Luther?

29:03.080 --> 29:04.600
It was Luther.

29:06.320 --> 29:08.360
You're 100% positive?

29:08.360 --> 29:11.640
He wore a cursory disguise,
a stocking-mask,

29:11.640 --> 29:16.240
but given that, I'd say...95%.

29:16.240 --> 29:20.840
Do you know what a decent defence
calls 95%? Reasonable doubt.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.720
Was it him?

29:22.720 --> 29:25.040
On balance, I'd guess so. Yes.

29:25.040 --> 29:26.360
You'd "guess"?

29:26.360 --> 29:30.440
I couldn't swear to it.
He killed his wife, Zoe!

29:30.440 --> 29:33.280
He's stolen the only hard evidence
we have to convict him!

29:33.280 --> 29:35.200
He busted your ribs! Wake up!

29:35.200 --> 29:37.280
Stop protecting him! I'm not.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.040
John just called.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.280
He wants to set up a meeting.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.960
Rose, Rose, I can't use this.

29:51.960 --> 29:54.640
If we put you there, unprotected,
he's going to kill you.

29:54.640 --> 29:57.960
It's not going to come to that.
He's convinced you killed his wife.

29:57.960 --> 30:01.080
He's delusional. So it may come to
that. Listen, I trust him.

30:01.080 --> 30:04.960
It'll be all right. I can bring him
in. I'm not sending you in naked.

30:04.960 --> 30:08.560
No more than I like doing it. But
this is John we're talking about.

30:08.560 --> 30:10.480
Look, you owe him nothing.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.760
He owes you. He owes us both.

30:12.760 --> 30:15.280
You're not going in there
unprotected. Final word.

30:15.280 --> 30:18.320
All right, but I'm not using this.

30:18.320 --> 30:21.240
So what kind of thing
you talking about?

30:21.240 --> 30:24.600
Tactical weapons support.
If it looks for one moment...

30:24.600 --> 30:28.760
Oh, no, no. ..your life's in danger,
I give the order.

30:28.760 --> 30:32.600
Rose... All right, we do it
like this or we don't do it at all.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.120
Your call.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.840
All right, OK, fine.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.480
Fine.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.960
Bring in the shooters.

31:08.920 --> 31:12.320
Don't speak. Drive.

31:16.560 --> 31:20.760
You and I...have been through
something today.

31:22.160 --> 31:26.000
And that makes us...
comrades in arms.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.920
Yeah, I suppose.

31:28.920 --> 31:34.000
And so as a comrade,
I'm asking you...

31:34.000 --> 31:35.280
what's troubling you?

31:35.280 --> 31:37.200
Eh? In what way?

31:37.200 --> 31:39.640
People like you and me,
we know how people look

31:39.640 --> 31:42.920
when they're hiding something.

31:44.560 --> 31:47.560
Is this an accusation? Of what?

31:47.560 --> 31:51.720
An atypical reaction to betrayal?

31:52.680 --> 31:56.000
What do you want?
To know what you think.

31:57.080 --> 31:59.160
About what?

31:59.160 --> 32:01.280
Luther's psychotic.

32:01.280 --> 32:05.280
He claims to believe Detective Chief
Inspector Reed killed his wife.

32:05.280 --> 32:11.000
If that's so, why did he go to the
trouble of stealing back that gun?

32:11.000 --> 32:14.520
It doesn't fit
the delusional framework.

32:14.520 --> 32:18.360
No. I suppose not.
So what's going on in Luther's head?

32:19.480 --> 32:22.000
Who can say?

32:22.000 --> 32:24.080
Well, who indeed?

32:47.360 --> 32:48.560
Arrgh!

32:51.000 --> 32:53.760
Hey! Mark, listen to me.

32:53.760 --> 32:55.480
Listen to me!

33:08.400 --> 33:09.480
I didn't do it.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.360
It wasn't me.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.560
Luther set the meet...

33:20.560 --> 33:22.080
here.

33:22.080 --> 33:23.800
For what? A chat?

33:23.800 --> 33:25.960
Apparently. No, he's lying.

33:25.960 --> 33:28.120
Of course he's lying, but why?

33:28.120 --> 33:32.880
You need to be there at 9am.
They'll be leaving, they'll ask
you to wait until they return.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.880
You'll be alone. And then what?

33:34.880 --> 33:37.400
Then you say you want to leave.
They can't stop you.

33:37.400 --> 33:39.680
Then you come back to me.

33:39.680 --> 33:42.040
You're putting Reed
at considerable risk.

33:42.040 --> 33:44.520
I'm mindful of that, sir.
But he's right.

33:44.520 --> 33:46.840
This is the best way
to bring Luther in.

33:46.840 --> 33:48.360
And Reed?

33:48.360 --> 33:50.400
Reed will be elsewhere.

33:51.800 --> 33:52.840
CO-19?

33:52.840 --> 33:54.480
Kitted and ready to go.

33:54.480 --> 33:59.360
And if circumstances warrant,
you won't hesitate
to give the kill order?

34:00.320 --> 34:02.320
Absolutely not.

34:06.840 --> 34:09.560
OK, OK.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.239
You're not coming?

34:23.239 --> 34:26.920
This doesn't fall within my compass,
for which I'm grateful.

34:26.920 --> 34:29.480
I've no desire
to see what happens next.

34:31.280 --> 34:33.320
You know, you don't
have to be there.

34:33.320 --> 34:35.040
I do.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.719
We ready?

34:39.960 --> 34:42.000
I need to speak to you.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.159
OK. Of course. Just that we have
a live situation right...

34:45.159 --> 34:47.600
That's OK. I can wait.
You sure? Absolutely.

34:47.600 --> 34:50.040
I'll look after Mr North.
There's really no need.

34:50.040 --> 34:52.880
Nonsense. I'll keep you
company until the others return.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.400
Mr North, if I may?

35:08.200 --> 35:11.200
This isn't going to work
if you can't control your temper.

35:11.200 --> 35:13.400
It's a weakness. He'll use it.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.320
I can control it. Well, you'd better.

35:15.320 --> 35:19.160
If I understand correctly, police
marksmen don't shoot to wound.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.760
No. They shoot to stop.

35:20.760 --> 35:22.320
Go for the centre of mass.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.320
Here. The heart.

35:25.160 --> 35:27.440
How apropos.

35:40.120 --> 35:42.200
BUZZ OF POLICE RADIO

35:52.280 --> 35:55.720
There he is, by the stairs.

36:05.000 --> 36:09.120
Sergeant? We've got a clear shot and
good to go. On my order. Not before.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.000
Received and understood.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.560
What do you want me to do?

36:12.560 --> 36:14.880
Kill you?

36:14.880 --> 36:17.320
Forgive you?

36:18.840 --> 36:21.760
I don't understand
how you could believe I did this.

36:23.560 --> 36:27.440
You've changed your tune since
the last time we spoke, Ian.

36:27.440 --> 36:28.760
No, John.

36:28.760 --> 36:32.760
I believe you did it, Ian,
because you did it!

36:32.760 --> 36:35.480
If you really
believe that, deep down,

36:35.480 --> 36:38.080
then why did you steal the gun?
'The gun.

36:38.080 --> 36:41.320
'Yeah, you did a decent job
with that.'

36:41.320 --> 36:42.600
But it's gone now.

36:42.600 --> 36:46.120
And so is the only piece of hard
evidence they've got against me.

36:46.120 --> 36:50.320
So whatever you're trying to do
to save yourself, it's over.

36:50.320 --> 36:52.040
It's done.

36:52.040 --> 36:54.320
You're not answering my question.
I think I am!

36:54.320 --> 36:55.440
'But if you didn't do it,

36:55.440 --> 36:58.240
'how could there be any
hard evidence against you?

36:58.240 --> 37:00.680
'How's that possible?'
What are you trying to say?

37:00.680 --> 37:03.240
'I've spoken to the doctors, John.'

37:03.240 --> 37:07.280
And what's happening to you,
is called a dissociative state.

37:07.280 --> 37:09.000
It's the mind distancing itself

37:09.000 --> 37:11.560
from things that are too much
for it to process.

37:11.560 --> 37:14.680
You blame me because you can't bear
to confront what you've done.

37:14.680 --> 37:17.080
You're in pain, you're distressed.

37:17.080 --> 37:20.880
You need help. So come home.
All right? Let us help you.

37:21.880 --> 37:23.040
HE CHUCKLES

37:27.240 --> 37:30.560
Thing is, Ian, you didn't come alone,
did you?

37:31.560 --> 37:33.360
Wouldn't have the balls.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.600
No, you came with CO-19, who,

37:36.600 --> 37:40.040
right now, have their assault rifles
trained on my centre of mass.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.120
And we do not shoot to stop.

37:42.120 --> 37:45.760
Not in our game, no. We shoot to
kill! Ain't that right, fellas?

37:45.760 --> 37:49.320
Sergeant?
Still clear and good to go.

37:49.320 --> 37:53.720
Ain't that right, boss? You got
the centre of mass, right here.

37:53.720 --> 37:57.640
That's what we're here for, isn't
it?! You prod me, you wind me up,

37:57.640 --> 38:00.280
I lose it, I threaten your life.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.440
And then you have a legal reason
to shoot me.

38:02.440 --> 38:05.000
Bang, bang. There goes your problems
out the window.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.720
'Oh, Luther, couldn't contain
his temper.'

38:07.720 --> 38:09.880
John, John listen to me.
You're ill.

38:09.880 --> 38:11.920
Ha-ha! And you're sick!

38:12.720 --> 38:16.400
I wonder...are you even interested
in why I've come here

38:16.400 --> 38:19.040
if I knew what you was up to?

38:19.040 --> 38:22.240
I don't know. Maybe you wanted
to get something off your chest.

38:22.240 --> 38:25.040
About something you did
to Henry Madsen, maybe?

38:25.040 --> 38:28.960
'Oh, nice try, no, no.
I've got nothing to confess.'

38:28.960 --> 38:32.200
Henry Madsen fell. And you know
how hard I tried to save him.

38:32.200 --> 38:34.760
I know how hard you tried.

38:34.760 --> 38:37.440
No, I...

38:37.440 --> 38:39.960
I came out here...

38:39.960 --> 38:41.600
Still clear, still clear.

38:41.600 --> 38:44.080
(..to get you away from
the locker rooms...)

38:45.600 --> 38:49.080
INDISTINCT SPEECH OVER RADIO
What's he saying?

38:49.080 --> 38:51.960
..where you're keeping the diamonds.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.800
Or where you were, up until
about five minutes ago.

38:58.600 --> 39:00.320
Oh, dear.

39:00.320 --> 39:02.240
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

39:02.240 --> 39:06.920
Tick, tick, tick.
I wonder where they could have gone.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.800
I didn't hurt Zoe, John.

39:09.800 --> 39:11.160
Ian, do me a favour. What?

39:11.160 --> 39:13.200
Don't say her name.

39:13.200 --> 39:16.640
Not any more. No more. All right?
It's over.

39:16.640 --> 39:19.680
What can I do to prove it? Just tell
me. Tell me, tell me what I can do.

39:19.680 --> 39:21.520
I thought I could listen to this.

39:21.520 --> 39:24.280
I thought I could stand here
and listen to you lie!

39:24.280 --> 39:25.360
To my face! Even now!

39:25.360 --> 39:27.920
How can you stand there and lie,
like it's nothing?

39:27.920 --> 39:31.280
'Because I didn't do it!' He goes
for a weapon, you take the shot.

39:31.280 --> 39:33.280
'I didn't do it. I loved Zoe, John.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.000
She was like family to me.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.960
Wait to see a weapon,
wait to see a weapon...

39:36.960 --> 39:39.960
So please, for her. For Zoe.
Please just come home. Don't!

39:39.960 --> 39:42.080
I love you too, man. Don't say that!

39:42.080 --> 39:43.200
You piece of shit!

39:43.200 --> 39:46.400
All I want to do is hear you say it.
Just say it one time.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.920
Just say what you did.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.360
Say it to me.

39:50.360 --> 39:54.560
Ian, mate, say it to me now!

39:54.560 --> 39:56.320
I can't! Say it!

39:56.320 --> 39:59.200
'No, because I didn't do it, John!'

39:59.200 --> 40:00.360
You did.

40:01.960 --> 40:05.120
He's got a knife. 'You killed her.'

40:05.120 --> 40:07.440
It's your fault!

40:07.440 --> 40:09.560
Do it. Take the shot. John! Run!

40:09.560 --> 40:11.400
Run!

40:11.400 --> 40:12.920
You got a shot, ma'am.

40:12.920 --> 40:16.240
Hold your fire! Hold your fire.
Don't shoot him in the back.

40:16.240 --> 40:17.720
All units, be alert.

40:17.720 --> 40:21.800
Suspect John Luther leaving the area
on foot, heading south-east, fast.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.200
Shit! Head him off! Stop him.

40:24.200 --> 40:26.240
Do you know what you've done?

40:26.240 --> 40:29.560
Yes, I do, ma'am.
Don't "ma'am" me.

40:29.560 --> 40:30.600
Badge!

40:47.920 --> 40:49.480
Arrest this man.

40:52.360 --> 40:55.440
Come on! Argh!

40:55.440 --> 40:56.720
Come on!

41:00.680 --> 41:03.520
How'd it go?

41:03.520 --> 41:06.800
I got what I wanted. And how close
did you come to getting shot?

41:06.800 --> 41:10.000
I didn't get shot.
Fine. Your funeral.

41:14.360 --> 41:18.160
That dick! Let it go. Would you?

41:18.160 --> 41:20.160
"Run, John". What was he thinking?

41:20.160 --> 41:22.200
He thought he was
being John's friend

41:22.200 --> 41:25.040
and it's already
cost him everything. So let it go.

41:25.040 --> 41:26.640
What, you suspended him?

41:26.640 --> 41:28.560
And charged him as an accessory.

41:28.560 --> 41:30.360
Ripley's finished.

41:30.360 --> 41:33.240
That's what being John's friend
does for you in the end.

41:33.240 --> 41:36.280
We all pay the price for it.
Come on, let's get back.

41:39.760 --> 41:42.360
Just, um...

41:44.520 --> 41:46.760
..once more, if I may.

41:49.960 --> 41:52.760
Um, Luther came to see you,

41:52.760 --> 41:56.280
er, he was distressed...
He was greatly distressed, yeah.

41:58.320 --> 42:02.400
It feels unseemly
to keep probing this,

42:02.400 --> 42:06.080
such a raw wound, so soon.

42:11.960 --> 42:15.600
I must ask what he said.
He said he didn't do it.

42:15.600 --> 42:18.960
Well, I suppose all things
are possible,

42:18.960 --> 42:20.760
although not equally.

42:25.120 --> 42:27.560
Is this going to take much longer?
No, I, er,

42:27.560 --> 42:30.000
think I've got
everything I want from you...

42:30.000 --> 42:33.640
If I could just ask you
to wait a little bit longer.

42:33.640 --> 42:37.520
The insight you've given
into his mental state,

42:37.520 --> 42:39.040
it may be of value...

42:39.040 --> 42:41.840
Can I please use the bathroom?
Of course.

42:59.480 --> 43:01.480
VOICES MUTTER

43:44.080 --> 43:46.160
All right. Get on with it.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.680
Ian?

43:55.400 --> 43:57.720
Thank you.

44:03.920 --> 44:06.440
I'm sorry. The, um, um, bathroom?

44:06.440 --> 44:08.120
I was... Yeah, yeah.

44:08.120 --> 44:10.840
Yeah, it's out there, on the right.

44:10.840 --> 44:14.840
The, um...flush is broken
on the cubicle nearest the wall.

44:14.840 --> 44:16.360
You might want to watch that.

44:16.360 --> 44:18.040
I will, thank you.

44:18.040 --> 44:19.560
Listen, er...

44:21.200 --> 44:24.200
I'm sorry...

44:24.200 --> 44:26.200
for your loss. She was very special.

44:26.200 --> 44:28.080
That's very kind. She was.

44:28.080 --> 44:29.640
Excuse me.

44:39.600 --> 44:43.040
I, er, I need to be away from here.

44:43.040 --> 44:45.840
Oh, yes,
possibly that's the best thing.

44:45.840 --> 44:49.000
We could arrange an escort,

44:49.000 --> 44:52.080
a protective detail?
I don't think Luther will be back.

44:52.080 --> 44:56.480
Even so, I, er,
I hope you're not on your own.

44:56.480 --> 44:57.800
It isn't healthy.

44:57.800 --> 45:00.680
Yes, I, er, I have somewhere to go...

45:00.680 --> 45:03.000
As you wish.

45:48.560 --> 45:51.160
It's Mark. I'm on my way.

45:51.160 --> 45:52.560
All right.

45:58.200 --> 46:01.840
Hi, this is DCI Reed.
Can you do me a favour?

46:01.840 --> 46:04.040
Er, can you run me
a trace and track?

46:04.040 --> 46:06.280
OK, it's Mark North...

46:50.800 --> 46:53.360
SLOW BEEPING

47:08.080 --> 47:09.840
FASTER BEEPING

47:23.080 --> 47:26.600
'Tick, tick, tick.
Where they could have gone.'

47:32.720 --> 47:34.320
'John! Run!

47:34.320 --> 47:35.640
'Run!

47:35.640 --> 47:38.120
'John! Run!

47:38.120 --> 47:39.840
'Run!'

47:56.960 --> 48:00.240
How long did you want to become
a police officer, Justin?

48:03.480 --> 48:05.120
Since I can remember.

48:05.120 --> 48:07.240
And why?

48:07.240 --> 48:09.000
Why a police officer?

48:09.000 --> 48:10.960
Does it matter?

48:22.680 --> 48:24.520
Big family?

48:25.600 --> 48:26.640
Yeah, pretty big.

48:26.640 --> 48:28.600
They're proud of you?

48:28.600 --> 48:30.120
Yes.

48:36.960 --> 48:39.240
Family's important to you, isn't it?

48:40.960 --> 48:42.080
Family,

48:42.080 --> 48:44.800
loyalty, trust.

48:44.800 --> 48:47.800
And rules are important, too.

48:47.800 --> 48:49.880
Aren't they? Yes.

48:49.880 --> 48:51.520
Yes!

48:55.480 --> 48:59.000
So why throw it all away
for nothing?

49:00.800 --> 49:02.440
You're not a fool.

49:10.320 --> 49:12.200
What have you got to lose?

49:12.200 --> 49:16.080
Your pride, your self respect?

49:16.080 --> 49:18.040
Your job?

49:18.040 --> 49:20.040
Well, they're all gone!

49:26.080 --> 49:27.480
RAPID BEEPING

49:27.480 --> 49:31.920
Something's happening that
no-one else can quite see.

49:31.920 --> 49:34.640
Well, I want to see it!

49:36.240 --> 49:37.880
What's happening?!

49:42.720 --> 49:45.760
Excuse me. What is it, Martin?

49:45.760 --> 49:49.000
We need to find
Detective Chief Inspector Reed.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.760
Most urgently.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.280
RAPID BEEPING

50:27.720 --> 50:29.280
Urgh!

50:29.280 --> 50:32.680
REED GRUNTS

50:32.680 --> 50:34.200
Ssh.

50:48.440 --> 50:50.880
So you've got North doing your
dirty work for you.

50:50.880 --> 50:53.840
Your dead wife's boyfriend,
stealing evidence.

50:53.840 --> 50:56.920
What is it about you, John?
You corrupt everything around you.

50:56.920 --> 50:58.720
You turn everything to shit.

51:03.800 --> 51:05.560
All this.

51:05.560 --> 51:07.440
All this, what you did.

51:07.440 --> 51:10.080
For what? For greed?

51:10.080 --> 51:11.680
Because you were scared?

51:11.680 --> 51:16.040
Well, now look. What do you
want me to say, John, huh?

51:17.560 --> 51:19.560
What, that I wish
I hadn't killed Zoe?

51:21.520 --> 51:25.840
I do. I wish I hadn't.

51:25.840 --> 51:27.360
I didn't go there meaning to.

51:30.120 --> 51:31.160
But I did.

51:32.520 --> 51:36.040
And so, now we're here,
just do what you got to do.

51:36.040 --> 51:39.000
All right, just commit.
She begged you.

51:39.000 --> 51:44.480
Come on! Just get it over with.
It'll be a relief. I'm sick of this.

51:44.480 --> 51:47.040
I know.

51:47.040 --> 51:48.640
I didn't come to kill you, Ian.

51:52.760 --> 51:55.440
'What, that I wish
I hadn't killed Zoe?

51:57.600 --> 52:01.560
'I do. I wish I hadn't...'

52:08.040 --> 52:10.440
What, so all this -

52:10.440 --> 52:13.480
bringing me here, sending her
boyfriend to the station,

52:13.480 --> 52:16.720
stealing the diamonds -
that was all a play?

52:16.720 --> 52:19.320
You set me up for a confession?
Pretty much.

52:19.320 --> 52:22.240
If I was you, I'd have killed me.
Nothing I'd like to do more.

52:22.240 --> 52:25.680
Do it, come on. I've come so far,
I don't even care.

52:25.680 --> 52:28.040
You know this is the end for me.

52:31.280 --> 52:32.320
No.

52:35.640 --> 52:38.200
Why not? Because I choose not to.

52:47.120 --> 52:51.280
Did she ever tell you
about her and me? Zoe?

52:51.280 --> 52:53.880
Oh, no, she didn't.
Of course she didn't. I knew that.

52:55.120 --> 52:56.240
What do you mean?

52:58.360 --> 52:59.720
It started one night...

53:01.440 --> 53:04.560
You'd stayed away working,
once too often.

53:04.560 --> 53:08.480
That's not going to work, Ian.
She cried afterwards.

53:08.480 --> 53:10.640
Yeah, washed the sheets.

53:10.640 --> 53:14.640
That's one of the memories
I've got of her - crying,

53:14.640 --> 53:17.000
naked, stuffing the sheets
into a machine.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.760
Calling me an arsehole, a bastard.

53:19.760 --> 53:22.160
She still made me do
it again before I left.

53:22.160 --> 53:26.560
It's not going to work. She told
I taught her how to really come.

53:26.560 --> 53:29.880
Ian, you can't play me.
You can't make me shoot you.

53:29.880 --> 53:31.920
You can't choose.

53:31.920 --> 53:34.960
No, no, no, no, no, no,
I can't play you!

53:34.960 --> 53:38.960
You're John Luther!
Who sees all, knows all!

53:38.960 --> 53:41.480
Come on, John.

53:41.480 --> 53:46.440
after a marriage that long, that
unhappy, with a woman that needy?

53:49.400 --> 53:51.800
Oh, there must have been
quite a few.

53:51.800 --> 53:55.040
Maybe you knew about some of them,
deep down. But you know what?

53:56.440 --> 53:57.880
I think I was her favourite.

53:57.880 --> 54:01.280
No more, Ian!
Because I was her revenge.

54:01.280 --> 54:04.880
Every orgasm she took from me
was to pay you back. Enough!

54:15.280 --> 54:20.800
How does it feel, eh? You murderer.
Come on, how does it feel, tell me?

54:25.840 --> 54:26.920
No.

54:26.920 --> 54:28.600
HE GASPS AND COUGHS

54:28.600 --> 54:32.160
No. Ian Reed,

54:32.160 --> 54:35.560
I'm arresting you
for the murder of Zoe Luther...

54:36.920 --> 54:38.280
Arrgh!

54:40.880 --> 54:42.960
You should have done it, John!

54:42.960 --> 54:46.720
Now look what
you're making me do. Look!

54:46.720 --> 54:47.960
Don't...

54:48.880 --> 54:52.120
Now look what you're making me do!
Ian...

54:52.120 --> 54:55.560
You should have stopped me, John!

54:55.560 --> 54:57.080
Ian!

54:59.200 --> 55:01.920
HE GASPS FOR BREATH

55:05.400 --> 55:06.560
Are you?

55:06.560 --> 55:11.680
Yeah. He swore
he wasn't going to kill you.

55:11.680 --> 55:15.040
He thought the humiliation
of prison would be worse.

55:15.040 --> 55:17.440
The beatings, the rapes,

55:17.440 --> 55:20.720
the incessant fear for your life,
but I told him,

55:20.720 --> 55:22.920
"No, John, you're wrong.

55:22.920 --> 55:24.960
"Dying would be worse."

55:24.960 --> 55:29.080
Because well, honestly,
it is, isn't it?

55:30.880 --> 55:33.040
Dying's just worse.

55:33.040 --> 55:34.840
So...

55:34.840 --> 55:38.080
Do I pull the trigger or not?

55:38.080 --> 55:40.720
No! Alice!

55:40.720 --> 55:44.320
Well, I'm in favour.

55:44.320 --> 55:48.760
Which leaves us 50-50,
with one vote left to cast. Mark?

55:49.960 --> 55:52.360
What do you think?

55:52.360 --> 55:55.040
You're a liar.

55:55.040 --> 55:57.440
He is a liar. Deciding vote, Mark.

55:57.440 --> 56:00.040
Alice.

56:00.040 --> 56:01.240
Alice, don't.

56:01.240 --> 56:04.920
Wasn't it enough to take her life?
Where is your respect?

56:04.920 --> 56:08.080
Where is your shame?! She didn't
look like a whore, though, did she?

56:08.080 --> 56:10.000
Don't listen to him.

56:10.000 --> 56:14.280
Don't listen to him.
I mean, not dressed, anyway.

56:14.280 --> 56:17.240
But strip her down,
roll her round a bit.

56:17.240 --> 56:20.000
Ooh... Stop, stop, STOP!

56:20.000 --> 56:21.680
OK, listen!

56:23.400 --> 56:26.000
Ian, stop!
Mark, I know how much you want

56:26.000 --> 56:27.680
to see him die, but don't do it.

56:27.680 --> 56:29.960
I mean she had a few good
rides left in her.

56:29.960 --> 56:31.960
Do it! Do it! Do it! Ian, no!

56:31.960 --> 56:35.560
No, no, no!

56:42.680 --> 56:46.840
# Baby, you understand me now

56:48.000 --> 56:52.280
# If sometimes you see that I'm mad

56:55.320 --> 56:57.400
# Don't you know no-one alive

56:57.400 --> 57:00.680
# Can always be an angel

57:01.680 --> 57:04.600
# When everything goes wrong

57:04.600 --> 57:06.280
# You see some bad...

57:06.280 --> 57:08.680
DISTANT SIRENS
Oh, no.

57:08.680 --> 57:10.240
# I'm just a soul

57:10.240 --> 57:14.240
# Whose intentions are good

57:14.240 --> 57:16.960
# Oh, Lord, please don't let me

57:16.960 --> 57:20.720
# Be misunderstood

57:24.160 --> 57:27.040
# I'm just a soul

57:27.040 --> 57:30.760
# Whose intentions are good

57:30.760 --> 57:34.000
# Oh, Lord, please don't let me

57:34.000 --> 57:37.200
# Be misunderstood

57:38.200 --> 57:40.280
Now what?

57:40.280 --> 57:42.360
# Don't let me be misunderstood... #

57:44.200 --> 57:47.240
