01:02.201 --> 01:05.170
lt's time to ride the slide
and taste the wind.

01:05.238 --> 01:07.138
Humphrey, you are totally genius.

01:07.507 --> 01:09.304
Come on. Let's do it.

01:09.876 --> 01:11.400
Air wolf!

01:15.381 --> 01:16.746
Guys. Guys.

01:20.153 --> 01:21.984
We're not moving!

01:23.389 --> 01:25.186
This caribou is mine.

01:27.960 --> 01:30.952
Kate, l'm not a caribou. l'm your sister!

01:33.299 --> 01:34.425
Gotcha.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.627
Omegas don't play like this.

01:36.836 --> 01:39.566
You can't escape the greatest Alpha ever.

01:40.440 --> 01:41.429
Well, l just did.

01:46.345 --> 01:47.573
We're going to die!

01:47.647 --> 01:49.672
Keep it steady! Keep it steady!

01:52.185 --> 01:53.948
What was l thinking?

02:00.226 --> 02:01.659
That was great!

02:01.727 --> 02:03.422
We are flying today, guys.

02:08.501 --> 02:09.592
Humphrey?

02:09.669 --> 02:10.761
Kate?

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.522 --> 02:30.716
What are you doing up here?

02:30.790 --> 02:32.621
l'm practice-hunting for our lunch.

02:32.892 --> 02:35.087
Good, 'cause l'm about to lose mine.

02:35.428 --> 02:36.622
You are?

02:36.696 --> 02:38.391
l'll try to swallow it.

02:40.566 --> 02:42.295
Kate!

02:42.368 --> 02:43.858
lt's time to go.

02:43.936 --> 02:45.836
l'm coming, Dad.

02:45.905 --> 02:47.133
Where you going?

02:47.206 --> 02:49.606
Alpha school. lt goes till spring.

02:49.942 --> 02:51.307
Spring?

02:51.377 --> 02:53.402
But that's a whole winter away.

02:55.715 --> 02:58.115
l know you're Kate's friend, Humphrey.

02:58.184 --> 03:01.620
But by next spring,
she will be a trained Alpha,

03:02.355 --> 03:04.118
the future leader of the pack.

03:06.692 --> 03:09.422
No doubt you'll be a clever Omega.

03:11.531 --> 03:13.931
Learn to keep the peace.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.524
And Humphrey,

03:16.569 --> 03:18.833
remind us all to have fun.

03:19.038 --> 03:20.027
But.. . But.. .

03:20.106 --> 03:22.131
Alphas and Omegas can't.. .

03:24.076 --> 03:26.067
How do you say it?

03:31.117 --> 03:35.451
That's our custom. The law of the pack.

03:37.857 --> 03:39.518
Wolf pile!

03:42.128 --> 03:43.595
Silly Omegas.

04:44.757 --> 04:46.019
Hey.

04:46.792 --> 04:48.726
Take a left! Thirty degrees!

04:51.831 --> 04:53.389
Salty, give her some sail draft!

04:54.133 --> 04:56.363
l think l taste the wind.

04:56.435 --> 04:58.300
No, just a bug.

05:00.239 --> 05:03.037
Hey, Mooch, get ready! Lower the boom!

05:05.578 --> 05:08.046
-All right!
-Hang 10, boys!

05:09.081 --> 05:12.482
Guys, we really need to work on the brakes!

05:12.551 --> 05:14.143
-Brakes?
-Brakes?

05:18.524 --> 05:20.617
Wolf pile!

05:23.195 --> 05:25.390
Get your butt out of my face.

05:25.464 --> 05:27.056
What did we hit?

05:31.270 --> 05:32.897
Spring.

05:37.343 --> 05:39.937
Look who's back from Alpha school.

05:40.479 --> 05:44.040
Forget about it, Humphrey.
Kate's an Alpha now.

05:44.116 --> 05:45.879
And you're an Omega.

05:46.952 --> 05:48.920
We're friends, okay?

05:48.988 --> 05:53.618
Exactly. Just friends. End of story.

05:53.693 --> 05:56.594
You better set your sights over there.

05:57.129 --> 06:01.793
Reba and Janice, the vegetarians.

06:05.638 --> 06:07.128
Okay.

06:09.342 --> 06:12.743
Looks like we're
eating caribou tonight, boys.

06:12.812 --> 06:14.074
Hey. Hey.

06:16.315 --> 06:18.078
Eastern Pack wolves.

06:23.122 --> 06:26.216
Can-do, Hutch, we've got company.

06:36.802 --> 06:38.793
Great. There goes dinner.

06:38.871 --> 06:40.532
And there goes Kate.

06:52.685 --> 06:54.585
-Holy.. .
-Caribou!

06:56.355 --> 06:58.152
Scatter to the sides!

07:02.862 --> 07:04.693
Look at those moves.

07:09.735 --> 07:11.430
Settle the score, leader.

07:37.730 --> 07:38.719
Are you all right?

07:39.265 --> 07:42.063
-Yeah, l'm fine.
-Hey, what's your problem,

07:42.134 --> 07:45.262
you stupid Eastern dog?
That was our hunt.

07:45.337 --> 07:46.998
You can't just snake it out from under us.

07:47.072 --> 07:48.539
Can-do, back off.

07:48.707 --> 07:50.937
You better listen to the girl.

07:52.244 --> 07:56.044
Hey, break it up.
Can-do, Hutch, break it up!

07:56.849 --> 07:59.181
All right, Omegas, duty calls.

07:59.251 --> 08:01.481
Stop it. Can-do, Hutch, stop!

08:01.554 --> 08:03.545
-Hey!
-Candy!

08:08.127 --> 08:09.958
-Kate.
-Humphrey?

08:10.062 --> 08:12.963
l'm still going to tear this snaggletooth
fool apart.

08:13.766 --> 08:16.200
Guys, lower the boom!

08:16.435 --> 08:18.903
Humphrey, we don't have time for fun.

08:29.915 --> 08:33.476
Guys, guys, come on.
Don't get your fur in a bunch.

08:33.552 --> 08:36.486
You wolves are making us look bad.
Come on, the caribou are laughing at us.

08:38.991 --> 08:40.982
Now, that's a moon
l don't want to howl to.

08:44.129 --> 08:47.621
Western hunt group, get back to the den.

08:50.202 --> 08:52.602
The two of you, go home.

08:53.539 --> 08:54.597
Now!

08:57.343 --> 08:59.834
Omegas, good job.

09:05.050 --> 09:07.780
Great. My first hunt, and l blew it.

09:07.853 --> 09:09.514
Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate.

09:09.588 --> 09:12.853
Don't beat yourself up. That's crazy.
You were amazing.

09:12.925 --> 09:15.826
l mean, if anyone's hungry, they can eat.. .

09:17.496 --> 09:19.361
They can always eat.. .

09:20.432 --> 09:21.421
What?

09:24.637 --> 09:25.626
Here.

09:26.038 --> 09:28.063
They can eat berries.

09:28.607 --> 09:34.045
Berries are really nutritious.

09:34.580 --> 09:37.071
Yeah. Tell that to a hungry pack.

10:17.022 --> 10:19.616
The Eastern Wolves ruined Kate's hunt.

10:20.759 --> 10:24.923
Luckily, the Omegas were there
to break up the fight.

10:31.837 --> 10:33.304
-Lilly.
-What?

10:34.473 --> 10:37.567
Very funny. Stop playing with your tail.

10:37.643 --> 10:40.441
Kate, you're slouching. Thank you, honey.

10:40.512 --> 10:42.571
Do you see how strong
and beautiful you are?

10:45.618 --> 10:46.983
My.

10:47.052 --> 10:50.283
Any food is a blessing, dear.

10:51.223 --> 10:55.023
Winston? Come join us for dinner? Now!

10:58.764 --> 11:00.527
Thank you, honey.

11:01.100 --> 11:04.126
Scraps and bones is no kind of dinner.

11:04.637 --> 11:06.127
Not for my pack.

11:07.439 --> 11:11.170
l'm sorry, Dad.
lt's just those Eastern Wolves.

11:11.543 --> 11:13.534
lt's not your fault, Kate.

11:13.612 --> 11:18.242
When they crossed into our territory,
they broke pack law.

11:18.317 --> 11:19.409
Winston.

11:24.189 --> 11:28.216
Can-do was jumped
by a group of Eastern Wolves.

11:28.293 --> 11:29.920
lt ain't nothing.

11:33.532 --> 11:35.898
Quickly, bring him into the den.

11:36.635 --> 11:39.399
Winston, honey, whoever did this,

11:39.471 --> 11:42.804
let's rip his tail off
and shove it down his throat.

11:44.677 --> 11:50.081
Sir, are we just going to let them
keep raiding our hunts and.. .

11:50.516 --> 11:53.280
Put our Alphas on alert.

11:53.485 --> 11:54.850
Already done, sir.

11:57.823 --> 11:59.085
Good job.

12:05.597 --> 12:08.498
Guys, honestly, caribou is overrated.

12:09.234 --> 12:13.603
lnstead, now, keep an open mind,
l just want you to have an open mind here,

12:13.672 --> 12:16.869
we bring you berries.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.507
How about squirrels?

12:26.819 --> 12:28.081
Bad joke.

12:28.153 --> 12:29.677
Flying squirrels.

13:02.921 --> 13:04.013
Winston!

13:04.389 --> 13:06.914
Tony! You're looking good.

13:09.261 --> 13:13.254
My back feels like wood.
l got this disk that keeps cracking.

13:14.566 --> 13:15.897
Drives me crazy.

13:15.968 --> 13:20.268
Yeah, Tony, you are one crazy wolf.

13:20.472 --> 13:22.133
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

13:22.508 --> 13:25.534
Like that little game of tag during our hunt.

13:26.011 --> 13:28.002
Let's leave the playing to the Omegas.

13:28.447 --> 13:31.041
You know
there's no caribou left in the east.

13:31.116 --> 13:32.378
You got a problem.

13:32.451 --> 13:37.218
Unite the packs, Winston.
lt was you who gave the big speech

13:37.289 --> 13:42.488
that your daughter Kate and my son Garth
would marry and unite the packs.

13:44.797 --> 13:48.893
Garth knows his responsibility. Does Kate?

13:51.937 --> 13:54.997
Don't worry. She knows.

13:55.674 --> 13:56.971
Good.

13:57.042 --> 14:01.672
Then she can meet Garth tonight
at the moonlight howl.

14:05.517 --> 14:08.680
l won't let my pack starve, Winston.

14:08.887 --> 14:12.755
lf we have to, we'll fight for the valley.

14:14.593 --> 14:16.720
That would be a big mistake.

14:18.330 --> 14:20.457
Kate. lt's.. .

14:20.532 --> 14:25.834
lt's okay, Dad. l understand. lt's.. .
lt's my responsibility.

14:35.814 --> 14:37.839
Guys, we got to get ready
for the moonlight howl.

14:38.917 --> 14:41.010
Guys, girls.

14:41.720 --> 14:42.709
Girls?

15:00.138 --> 15:02.402
You are cool.

15:03.508 --> 15:04.702
So, let me go ahead.. .

15:05.844 --> 15:09.610
Prepare the girls for your arrival
and you guys meet me there.

15:09.681 --> 15:10.943
Game on.

15:11.717 --> 15:13.116
Girls.

15:21.793 --> 15:25.490
Kate, you look so beautiful.

15:25.564 --> 15:28.829
Now, if Garth gets out of line,

15:28.901 --> 15:31.495
take those beautiful teeth of yours,

15:31.637 --> 15:35.971
go for the throat, and don't let go
until the body stops shaking.

15:41.613 --> 15:45.640
lf my little girl doesn't want to do this,
if she's not ready.. .

15:46.718 --> 15:49.050
Don't worry, Dad. l'm ready.

15:51.156 --> 15:52.418
Come on, Lilly.

15:52.491 --> 15:53.856
Okay. Okay.

16:48.413 --> 16:52.474
Your fur.. . lt looks fantastic tonight.

16:52.551 --> 16:54.451
Oh, my gosh. l had.. .

16:54.553 --> 16:55.611
Omega alert.

16:58.757 --> 17:00.486
l will handle this.

17:00.559 --> 17:02.527
lt totally relaxes the knots.

17:02.594 --> 17:03.652
Hey.

17:05.630 --> 17:06.688
Hey.

17:09.166 --> 17:10.498
That's all l've got.

17:14.506 --> 17:17.441
Wow. This is a new feeling.

17:17.509 --> 17:19.374
l saw the whole thing, guys.

17:19.444 --> 17:23.904
And, l cannot believe
they didn't just fall all over you.

17:23.982 --> 17:27.781
When you yelled, ''Hey,''
l thought you cinched it right there.

17:28.086 --> 17:31.180
So, you think you can do better?

17:31.256 --> 17:32.655
Please.

17:32.724 --> 17:35.784
The next girl that comes up the hill,
she's mine.

17:41.600 --> 17:44.125
l've never seen her look that good.

17:45.771 --> 17:47.568
Kate is hot.

18:03.355 --> 18:05.414
l'll be right back.

18:06.525 --> 18:07.583
Hey.

18:08.226 --> 18:10.160
Where do you think you're going?

18:10.228 --> 18:12.287
Humphrey, you know the rules.

18:12.364 --> 18:15.197
You're not allowed to howl with her.
She's an Alpha.

18:15.267 --> 18:16.632
We can eat together.

18:16.701 --> 18:20.398
But we can't, you know, howl together.

18:20.472 --> 18:23.100
Guys, l know. l.. . l was just.. .

18:24.876 --> 18:26.104
Kidding.

18:29.081 --> 18:32.346
Cheer up, buddy. You still got us.

18:32.417 --> 18:34.817
Friends for life!

18:38.857 --> 18:40.654
Ugly.

18:43.228 --> 18:45.321
So, do you see Garth?

18:45.864 --> 18:46.853
Great.

18:46.998 --> 18:50.798
l'm not even sure what he looks like.
But l'm sure.. .

18:54.005 --> 18:55.700
We'll know him when we see him.

18:56.241 --> 18:57.765
Hey, Kate.

18:59.611 --> 19:00.839
What?

19:03.248 --> 19:04.579
Garth.

19:06.184 --> 19:07.776
Lilly, stand up.

19:08.420 --> 19:12.049
Garth, hello. Good to see you.

19:13.258 --> 19:15.988
-Humphrey?
-My butt! My butt.

19:16.061 --> 19:17.085
lt really hurts.

19:17.696 --> 19:19.425
You should really do something
about that cough.

19:19.498 --> 19:22.092
Be careful, Kate.
There's something going around.

19:22.167 --> 19:24.465
Tails and ears are falling off, literally.

19:25.604 --> 19:27.265
Name's Humphrey.

19:28.440 --> 19:29.600
Garth.

19:29.674 --> 19:32.802
Wow. You are a.. .
You are a big one, aren't you?

19:32.878 --> 19:35.142
Wow. You're practically a moose.

19:35.213 --> 19:36.271
Where you hiding them antlers?

19:36.348 --> 19:37.747
Who's the coyote?

19:38.216 --> 19:41.447
Who's the coyote? l get it.
That's good, 'cause l'm, like.. .

19:41.520 --> 19:43.147
No one important.

19:43.622 --> 19:47.581
Lilly, why don't you take
little coyote Humphrey and run along?

19:53.965 --> 19:55.956
Come on, Humphrey.

19:56.034 --> 19:59.060
Let's go eat some of those bitter berries.

20:09.514 --> 20:10.503
So, tell me about yourself.

20:11.950 --> 20:13.884
What does Garth like to do?

20:13.952 --> 20:18.480
Well, l'm really into fitness, you know?

20:18.890 --> 20:23.054
Rabbit sprints, tree squats.

20:28.733 --> 20:32.669
You know us Alphas got to keep fit
to lead the pack.

20:33.371 --> 20:36.033
But, what really gets me going is.. .

21:01.299 --> 21:03.324
Was it good for you?

21:04.669 --> 21:06.136
Unbelievable.

21:08.907 --> 21:10.602
You know.. .

21:10.675 --> 21:15.578
l just.. . Just.. . Hold on a sec
'cause l'm going to be right back.

21:15.647 --> 21:20.778
l.. . l need some water. Some water. Okay?
So, l'll.. . Just.. . Hold on.

21:27.259 --> 21:33.289
No worries.
l'll just keep my vocal chords warm.

21:33.565 --> 21:34.793
Yeah.

21:36.534 --> 21:38.229
''Oh, he's no one important.

21:38.303 --> 21:40.897
''Just take little coyote Humphrey
and run along.' '

21:41.406 --> 21:42.703
Coyote.

21:57.155 --> 21:59.180
-Where's Barf?
-lt's Garth.

21:59.257 --> 22:00.884
And we're just taking a little break.

22:01.126 --> 22:02.252
A break?

22:02.327 --> 22:03.919
What? ls that so strange?

22:03.995 --> 22:06.623
No. No, no, no, no. Are you kidding?

22:06.698 --> 22:10.429
l always like to take a break
10 minutes into a howl.

22:10.502 --> 22:12.231
Well, l do.

22:12.304 --> 22:16.764
Your howling partner, he's not a.. .
He's not a stud.

22:16.841 --> 22:20.607
Not a stud but, like, it's like ''stud'' but.. .

22:21.146 --> 22:23.171
A dud. A dud. That's it. lsn't he?

22:25.417 --> 22:26.611
No.

22:27.352 --> 22:28.944
He is not a dud.

22:29.554 --> 22:34.287
ln fact, Humphrey,
you'd be surprised to find that he is.. .

22:37.429 --> 22:38.919
Strong!

22:38.997 --> 22:44.128
Yes. Yes! Strong! And he's.. . He's.. .

22:44.569 --> 22:46.696
-Proud!
-Yes! Yes.

22:47.038 --> 22:50.235
Proud. And he's.. .
What's the word l'm looking for?

22:51.643 --> 22:53.406
An Alpha's Alpha.

22:53.645 --> 22:57.411
That is right! He is an Alpha's Alpha.

23:00.318 --> 23:01.615
You make me so mad!

23:03.054 --> 23:04.578
Hey, l was just kidding.

23:09.327 --> 23:10.919
You're kind of cute.

23:10.995 --> 23:17.195
Really? You think.. . So, wow. Okay. Cute.
Yeah. That's.. . Look.. .

23:17.268 --> 23:19.202
Thank you, first of all,

23:19.270 --> 23:24.173
but do you mean ''Cute'' in, like, a rugged,
kind of handsomely ''Cute''?

23:24.843 --> 23:29.041
Again with the butt.
These mosquitoes are out of control.

23:31.649 --> 23:33.514
l'll meet you on Mars,

23:34.753 --> 23:38.382
right after l eat the Milky Way.

23:38.456 --> 23:40.617
That sounds good.

23:43.027 --> 23:47.930
Save some for me.

23:52.537 --> 23:55.802
Bag them up, boys. We're going to ldaho.

23:55.874 --> 23:57.239
You got it, chief.

23:57.308 --> 24:00.209
Okay. There we go. Watch out there.

24:12.157 --> 24:13.249
Kate?

25:01.573 --> 25:02.733
Where am l?

25:05.677 --> 25:07.144
Humphrey?

25:07.212 --> 25:08.736
ls that you?

25:08.813 --> 25:10.542
Kate! Where are we?

25:10.982 --> 25:12.882
l don't know.

25:12.951 --> 25:14.179
Maybe we're dead.

25:15.787 --> 25:18.221
Nope. Definitely not dead.

25:18.923 --> 25:21.824
At least they left us some water.

25:21.893 --> 25:23.190
You got water?

25:23.962 --> 25:25.896
Nope. Definitely not water.

25:27.198 --> 25:29.894
Kate, what are you doing?

25:31.769 --> 25:32.929
Trying to get out.

25:36.074 --> 25:37.132
Calm down.

25:37.208 --> 25:39.608
Listen, maybe they're taking us
to where there's more food.

25:39.677 --> 25:41.440
Or maybe we are the food.

25:42.447 --> 25:46.315
Kate, you're right. Fight. Fight. Fight. Fight.

25:51.890 --> 25:52.982
Yeah.

25:55.760 --> 25:57.921
All right. Set them free.

26:02.634 --> 26:04.067
Look at them go.

26:16.648 --> 26:17.637
Wow.

26:18.883 --> 26:20.544
This isn't Jasper.

26:22.020 --> 26:24.887
Yeah, but it sure does.. . Rock!

26:27.492 --> 26:29.084
Quick, get down!

26:30.828 --> 26:32.557
What are they doing?

26:32.931 --> 26:36.492
What a smashingly brilliant story this is.

26:36.768 --> 26:41.205
The golfing goose from the low regions
of the Arctic Circle is leading the pack.

26:41.272 --> 26:43.740
He's using the wrong club.

26:48.713 --> 26:54.117
Could you do me a favor, Needles,
and shut the hole that makes the words?

26:56.688 --> 26:59.122
Looks like they're playing
some sort of weird game.

26:59.190 --> 27:01.351
Maybe they can tell us how to get home.

27:01.426 --> 27:03.587
Yeah. And if they can't, we can eat them.

27:03.661 --> 27:05.458
Yeah. Follow my lead.

27:21.479 --> 27:23.174
Yeah, l'm right behind you.

27:35.526 --> 27:38.984
Now you will see, this shot is mine.

27:45.303 --> 27:48.033
Splendid! Wonderful hit, sir.

27:59.584 --> 28:00.608
Just a minute!

28:14.999 --> 28:17.126
lt's ugly, but a good runner.

28:28.880 --> 28:30.370
Did you see that? Did you see that?

28:30.548 --> 28:33.176
l guess the birdie ruined your Birdie.

28:33.718 --> 28:35.652
You mark it ''Birdie''
because it would have gone in.

28:35.720 --> 28:38.382
Technically, sir, it might have gone in.

28:38.456 --> 28:41.118
That silly bird
stopped my shot from going in.

28:41.192 --> 28:43.820
So, l will not take an extra stroke.

28:43.895 --> 28:45.487
Mark it Birdie!

28:45.563 --> 28:47.326
Well, it.. . lt was an obstacle.

28:50.735 --> 28:53.670
And everyone has to play
with the obstacles.

28:54.806 --> 28:56.603
You know, we wouldn't want to lie.

28:56.674 --> 28:59.404
This is not a lie.
This is not a lie if you are French.

28:59.477 --> 29:04.346
Well, French-Canadian. There's a slash,
a hyphen, in between there.

29:05.416 --> 29:07.008
-l say French.
-Canadian.

29:07.085 --> 29:08.484
-French.
-Canadian.

29:08.553 --> 29:09.781
-French!
-Canadian, sir.

29:09.854 --> 29:12.846
May l just say, though,
that you are a wonderful golfer.

29:14.892 --> 29:18.988
And you are a very good caddie.

29:19.564 --> 29:21.725
Take off!

29:21.799 --> 29:23.096
Paddy, what is wrong with you?

29:27.472 --> 29:28.803
Hello.

29:29.874 --> 29:31.535
You are two wolves.

29:31.609 --> 29:34.169
l have not seen many wolves
in these parts.

29:34.245 --> 29:36.873
But l am not afraid of wolves. No.

29:36.948 --> 29:38.540
l like wolves.

29:40.118 --> 29:43.281
Good. 'Cause we just want to ask you
a few questions.

29:43.354 --> 29:46.414
Yes. Quick! Look behind you!

29:48.826 --> 29:50.088
Grab him!

29:53.731 --> 29:56.632
So, you want to face
the French Resistance?

29:56.701 --> 29:58.328
That's French-Canadian!

29:58.736 --> 30:00.727
My butt! My butt! My butt!

30:01.539 --> 30:02.528
Omegas.

30:04.342 --> 30:06.435
This is not a game anymore!

30:06.844 --> 30:08.277
Don't you wash your feet?

30:08.513 --> 30:10.071
Look out for the trees!

30:11.849 --> 30:13.214
Watch that.

30:13.284 --> 30:14.342
Nice one, sir.

30:15.419 --> 30:16.511
Gotcha.

30:17.622 --> 30:18.646
Oh, no.

30:22.193 --> 30:23.421
That's got to hurt.

30:23.494 --> 30:26.258
How do you like it now, wolf?

30:30.601 --> 30:31.625
Hole in one, sir.

30:33.938 --> 30:36.907
You have bit off more than you can chew
this time, my friend.

30:36.974 --> 30:38.339
Help!

30:39.510 --> 30:41.535
My goodness. l.. . Look out for the.. .

30:42.847 --> 30:44.508
No. No. No. No. No. No.

30:44.582 --> 30:46.345
He's a goner for sure.

30:53.124 --> 30:55.524
Wait, what are you looking at?
What are you looking at?

30:56.394 --> 30:57.725
Hey, Frank.

31:10.541 --> 31:13.101
Okay. You have a question?

31:13.177 --> 31:15.611
Yeah. Where are we?

31:16.180 --> 31:17.204
ldaho?

31:17.582 --> 31:18.708
lda-who?

31:19.183 --> 31:23.051
<i>Oui,</i> ldaho, land of mountains, rivers, lakes,

31:23.454 --> 31:26.048
and a few billion potatoes.

31:26.123 --> 31:28.216
Sawtooth National Wilderness.

31:28.292 --> 31:30.123
What are we doing in ldaho?

31:30.394 --> 31:34.854
You were relocated to repopulate.

31:39.437 --> 31:43.840
They want you big wolves
to make a lot of little wolves.

31:45.042 --> 31:47.704
Sounds good to me.
Park shouldn't be without some wolves.

31:47.778 --> 31:50.474
l mean, only for the good of the park.

31:50.548 --> 31:54.177
So you two are undomesticated partners?

31:54.252 --> 31:56.812
Paddy, please. Don't be rude.

31:56.888 --> 32:00.790
So, you two are boyfriend, girlfriend?

32:00.858 --> 32:03.520
You are an item?

32:05.229 --> 32:06.958
-Well.. .
-No.

32:07.031 --> 32:09.431
You wolves, you are funny.

32:12.670 --> 32:14.604
We have to get home now.

32:14.672 --> 32:17.163
There's going to be trouble
if l don't get back to Jasper.

32:17.241 --> 32:19.709
Right. All right. You're freaking out.

32:19.777 --> 32:22.871
l'm not freaking out.
l just have to get home.

32:22.947 --> 32:25.677
-ls this about Barf?
-lt's Garth.

32:25.750 --> 32:29.311
And it's about responsibilities.
So, l don't expect you to understand.

32:30.655 --> 32:31.883
Can you help me?

32:31.956 --> 32:33.423
l need to get home fast.

32:34.091 --> 32:35.922
All right, Miss Fast.

32:36.594 --> 32:38.619
Where is home sweet home?

32:39.797 --> 32:41.424
Jasper Park, Canada.

32:41.499 --> 32:46.198
Jasper park? Get out of here.
We love Jasper Park!

32:46.270 --> 32:48.864
Yes, yes. We've toured it many times.

32:48.940 --> 32:52.034
Paddy, please. We've toured it many times.

32:52.476 --> 32:54.740
l dated a Pintail from Jasper once.

32:54.812 --> 32:58.339
She never stopped quacking.
Drove me nuts.

32:58.416 --> 33:00.316
Drove her right to me.

33:00.685 --> 33:02.448
Bound to happen. Bound to happen.

33:03.087 --> 33:05.351
So, you can help me, then, get home.

33:05.423 --> 33:10.417
We haven't played Jasper in quite a while.
l think it would be a smashing idea.

33:12.396 --> 33:15.365
This is true. So, of course l will help.

33:15.433 --> 33:17.401
l like you two. You make me laugh.

33:18.069 --> 33:20.731
And you didn't eat me, so l owe you favor.

33:28.779 --> 33:30.906
Where did she go?

33:30.982 --> 33:32.779
Maybe l should ask you.

33:32.850 --> 33:34.750
You know that's not my style.

33:34.986 --> 33:37.580
My wolf, Can-do, knows your style.

33:40.024 --> 33:42.652
l just want to say one thing.

33:42.727 --> 33:46.322
lf any of you wolves
have hurt my daughter,

33:46.397 --> 33:52.802
l will personally rip out your eyes
and shove them down your throat

33:52.870 --> 33:56.465
so you can see my claws
tear your carcass open!

33:59.977 --> 34:00.966
Mom?

34:01.045 --> 34:03.843
Not now, dear. Mommy's in a rage.

34:04.115 --> 34:07.482
Well, since Kate stood up Garth,

34:07.551 --> 34:09.746
l could show him around
until she gets back.

34:10.855 --> 34:12.447
l wouldn't say ''Stood up.' '

34:12.523 --> 34:14.114
Garth!

34:14.190 --> 34:15.248
Sounds good to me.

34:15.326 --> 34:16.554
Well, come on, Garth.

34:22.967 --> 34:27.063
lsn't that sweet? She gets it from me.

34:29.273 --> 34:32.264
l'll give her till the full moon.

34:43.187 --> 34:45.212
<i>lt is beautiful out there.</i>

34:45.289 --> 34:47.449
<i>Almost makes you want</i>
<i>to hit the potato patch.</i>

34:48.025 --> 34:50.789
<i>lf you haven't already hit the outdoors,</i>
<i>get on out your door.</i>

34:50.860 --> 34:52.293
<i>The weather today is...</i>

34:52.362 --> 34:54.524
Your ride home.

34:54.598 --> 34:55.963
Quick! Get in!

34:58.669 --> 35:03.299
What? Boxed up twice in one day.
What are the odds?

35:05.042 --> 35:06.737
-Hide!
-Hide!

35:08.079 --> 35:11.480
That right there
is Garn and Debbie Theocarcus.

35:11.549 --> 35:16.179
Lucky for you, they travel every year
to Jasper right after Sawtooth.

35:16.253 --> 35:20.747
The day's looking pretty,
and so is my woman.

35:25.229 --> 35:27.527
This is the song we met to.

35:27.598 --> 35:29.896
Come here, you. Let's dance.

35:31.368 --> 35:32.960
-Down here.
-Hurry.

35:34.305 --> 35:39.834
Now, he was in a motorcycle gang,
and she was a librarian.

35:39.910 --> 35:41.878
And opposites attract, if you will.

35:41.946 --> 35:45.279
Exactly. ln this case,
it was a bookstore that also sold beer.

35:45.349 --> 35:46.373
So, they met.

35:50.387 --> 35:51.854
Come on. We have to get in.

36:00.598 --> 36:01.826
All right. Here we go.

36:09.106 --> 36:10.437
You're just a dream.

36:18.749 --> 36:21.013
l'm like a little bunny. Aren't l, dear?

36:28.492 --> 36:30.084
l love you, Deb.

36:31.028 --> 36:32.620
l love you, too.

36:40.104 --> 36:42.334
Get inside now. Get inside. Quick.

36:42.406 --> 36:45.000
Well, back in a box.

36:50.281 --> 36:51.680
Good luck, you two!

36:51.749 --> 36:54.343
We will be watching out for you
from above!

36:54.418 --> 36:57.478
Well, l'll be watching out for you.
He will be breathing heavily.

37:17.341 --> 37:20.469
<i>lf we have to, we'll fight for the valley.</i>

37:26.250 --> 37:27.308
Humphrey?

38:04.521 --> 38:07.786
So, why is this called
Rabbit Poo Mountain?

38:08.125 --> 38:10.355
Because this is where rabbits like to poo.

38:13.797 --> 38:15.059
l was just kidding.

38:16.200 --> 38:18.065
l get it. You're a funny Omega.

38:20.304 --> 38:22.295
Okay. Make me laugh.

38:28.379 --> 38:29.710
What am l?

38:33.317 --> 38:34.511
You got me.

38:34.585 --> 38:37.076
lt's a turtle that fell and can't get up.

38:37.354 --> 38:38.651
That's pretty good.

38:38.722 --> 38:40.883
Okay. What's this?

38:43.193 --> 38:45.093
lt's turtle road kill.

38:46.730 --> 38:48.527
What else can you do?

38:48.599 --> 38:50.066
l just do turtles.

38:50.134 --> 38:51.624
Okay, it's my turn.

38:51.702 --> 38:53.192
You want to see something
an Alpha can do?

38:54.905 --> 38:56.566
Would my mother approve?

38:56.640 --> 38:58.005
Of course.

38:58.075 --> 38:59.667
Well, okay then.

39:14.758 --> 39:18.216
Keep searching.
We must find her before tomorrow night.

39:36.680 --> 39:38.011
Winston?

39:41.352 --> 39:43.286
Don't worry, Eve.

39:43.354 --> 39:46.187
She's the finest Alpha l've trained.

39:46.256 --> 39:47.917
l'm not, Winston.

39:47.991 --> 39:50.983
She's also the finest Alpha
l've ever trained.

40:09.046 --> 40:10.445
We stopped.

40:22.159 --> 40:24.059
-What's wrong with you?
-l have to go.

40:24.128 --> 40:26.619
You can't leave. Can't you hold it?

40:26.697 --> 40:27.686
No! l can't.

40:28.165 --> 40:29.928
Well, did you try crossing your legs?

40:30.000 --> 40:31.331
-Yes!
-Holding your breath?

40:31.402 --> 40:33.131
Yes! l almost passed out.

40:33.203 --> 40:36.604
-Closing your eyes and.. .
-ln or out, l am going.

40:39.143 --> 40:40.371
Would you hurry?

40:40.444 --> 40:42.742
l can't go when l feel pressured.

40:42.813 --> 40:43.837
Go!

41:07.104 --> 41:09.368
What is he doing?

41:11.108 --> 41:13.633
The packaging's wolf-proof.

41:27.024 --> 41:28.423
Where is he?

41:30.060 --> 41:31.618
Come on, Humphrey.

41:52.115 --> 41:53.707
lt's a rabid wolf!

41:53.784 --> 41:55.217
Max, bring that gun!

41:58.322 --> 42:00.688
This is it for you, wolf. Any last wishes?

42:14.571 --> 42:15.868
Max, they're getting away!

42:15.939 --> 42:17.236
Not if l can help it.

42:17.875 --> 42:19.103
-No!
-We're trapped.

42:20.744 --> 42:22.735
l got you both now.

42:22.813 --> 42:24.144
Shoot them!

42:29.253 --> 42:31.050
Nicely done, Max.

42:59.016 --> 43:01.883
Okay.
Thinking with my belly instead of my head,

43:01.952 --> 43:05.319
not a good idea. l get it.
l say we build a comfy den.. .

43:05.389 --> 43:07.755
-l'm going home.
-Great.

43:07.824 --> 43:10.224
You're going home, and it's raining.

43:10.861 --> 43:12.488
l'm not stopping.

43:13.230 --> 43:15.425
<i>Rain, rain, go away</i>

43:15.499 --> 43:17.364
<i>Get out of here, rain</i>
<i>No one wants you around</i>

43:17.434 --> 43:18.662
What are you doing?

43:18.735 --> 43:21.203
lt's.. .
lt's a rain dance, to stop it from raining.

43:22.940 --> 43:24.737
<i>'Cause you're wet</i>
<i>And you really are going to ruin our day</i>

43:24.808 --> 43:27.299
Humphrey, rain dances make it rain.

43:31.415 --> 43:35.374
Right! Well, l'll just do it backwards.

43:41.758 --> 43:42.884
That actually worked.

43:51.335 --> 43:52.427
Kate?

43:55.272 --> 43:56.830
That's not a good idea.

43:58.575 --> 44:00.167
Hold on, Kate!

44:27.604 --> 44:28.593
No!

44:30.073 --> 44:31.631
Hold on, Kate! l'm coming!

44:35.212 --> 44:36.873
Let me think. Let me think.

44:43.286 --> 44:44.548
Humphrey!

44:49.393 --> 44:51.623
Don't worry, Kate. lt's all part of my plan.

44:51.695 --> 44:53.060
l can see that.

44:54.831 --> 44:56.958
Kate. Kate! Grab my tail.

44:57.034 --> 44:58.399
Grab your what?

44:58.468 --> 45:01.301
Take those Alpha jaws and grab.. .

45:02.572 --> 45:04.130
My tail. My tail.

45:06.743 --> 45:09.610
Kate, wiggle. Wiggle around.

45:12.416 --> 45:15.476
That tickles. My tail hurts!

45:18.488 --> 45:20.217
Who knew l was ticklish there?

45:20.290 --> 45:22.053
l can't take any more.

45:32.235 --> 45:33.429
No.

45:34.304 --> 45:36.568
My gosh. Humphrey! Humphrey!

45:40.544 --> 45:43.479
Your tail. l'm so sorry.

45:43.547 --> 45:45.344
My tail's actually fine,

45:46.950 --> 45:48.713
last time l checked.

45:55.158 --> 45:57.786
Come on. Let's get out of the rain.

45:57.861 --> 45:59.260
Okay.

46:02.566 --> 46:03.897
Thank you.

46:18.482 --> 46:21.212
Sir, we've searched the entire territory.

46:22.052 --> 46:23.917
Still no sign of Kate.

46:28.391 --> 46:29.449
Sir?

46:30.026 --> 46:32.893
We must defend our territory.

46:56.386 --> 46:57.648
Fore!

47:00.056 --> 47:03.321
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

47:03.393 --> 47:05.588
l say, we've caught them
at quite the bad time.

47:05.662 --> 47:07.721
No, l'd say we caught them at a good time.

47:07.798 --> 47:09.493
lndeed, sir. lndeed.

47:09.966 --> 47:11.399
What are you doing here?

47:11.468 --> 47:14.562
No, the question
is what are you doing here?

47:14.638 --> 47:17.402
l give you a first class ticket home.. .

47:17.474 --> 47:19.032
lt's a straight shot right to the pin.

47:19.109 --> 47:20.599
-And you blow it?
-Yep.

47:21.678 --> 47:23.145
Over a cupcake.

47:23.814 --> 47:25.873
Ridiculous dessert. ''A cupcake.' '

47:25.949 --> 47:27.382
Actually, they're quite delicious.

47:28.051 --> 47:30.542
There has to be another way
for us to get to Jasper.

47:30.620 --> 47:33.612
Another way? Another way?

47:33.690 --> 47:36.591
Always another way.
What am l, a travel agent?

47:37.127 --> 47:38.788
Come on. What, are you kidding me?

47:38.862 --> 47:42.593
A great sportsman like yourself
always knows a few ways to win the game.

47:42.666 --> 47:45.658
Well, there could be a train.

47:45.735 --> 47:48.329
Actually, there is a train.
lt's the Canadian Express and.. .

47:48.405 --> 47:50.873
Paddy, please.
lt's called the Canadian Express.. .

47:50.941 --> 47:52.738
Yes, and it shoots right by Jasper Park.

47:52.809 --> 47:54.936
Right by Jasper Park.

47:55.011 --> 47:56.706
-lf you can catch it.. .
-You'll be home in no time.

47:56.780 --> 47:58.008
No time. Very fast.

47:58.081 --> 48:00.379
Great. So where do we board?

48:00.450 --> 48:02.418
Where do you board?

48:02.485 --> 48:03.850
Watch this.

48:08.291 --> 48:10.122
On the other side of that mountain.

48:10.193 --> 48:11.626
Paddy, please.

48:11.695 --> 48:13.162
Come on!

48:13.230 --> 48:17.132
Let it slip, but may l say,
that was a stupendous shot.

48:17.200 --> 48:19.828
You may,
and it was pretty good, wasn't it?

48:19.903 --> 48:21.598
lndeed, sir. lndeed.

48:39.456 --> 48:41.686
Dinner for two.

48:42.359 --> 48:45.021
lt's a new move
l've been working on for stalking prey.

48:45.595 --> 48:46.892
You're good.

48:46.963 --> 48:49.898
Thanks. Now you try.

48:50.300 --> 48:52.200
No. l.. .

48:52.502 --> 48:54.197
l'm not much of a hunter.

48:54.271 --> 48:56.398
Come on. You'll do great.

48:56.840 --> 48:58.501
Just do what l do.

48:59.576 --> 49:00.600
Okay.

49:02.012 --> 49:03.036
Ready?

49:03.880 --> 49:05.814
-One.
-One.

49:05.882 --> 49:07.679
-Two.
-Two.

49:07.751 --> 49:09.150
Three!

49:15.425 --> 49:16.687
Lilly!

49:22.532 --> 49:23.829
Lilly?

49:27.370 --> 49:29.668
A turtle, right?

49:30.941 --> 49:32.738
l told you, l don't hunt.

49:38.114 --> 49:40.173
Maybe this will help.

49:43.720 --> 49:44.982
Wow.

49:45.055 --> 49:46.784
''Wow'' what?

49:46.856 --> 49:48.187
Your eyes.

49:48.258 --> 49:49.691
They're beautiful.

49:53.430 --> 49:55.091
Come on. Let's try again.

50:02.105 --> 50:03.936
-lt sure is pretty out there.
-Yeah.

50:05.809 --> 50:08.073
-l'll race you to the top.
-You're on.

50:09.479 --> 50:12.573
Give it up, Humphrey! You'll never beat me.

50:17.253 --> 50:18.447
Humphrey?

50:23.093 --> 50:25.391
Omega one, Alpha zero!

50:28.498 --> 50:29.829
Okay! Okay!

50:29.899 --> 50:32.993
Enough, enough! Stop! Stop!
l get it. l get it. l get it.

50:33.536 --> 50:35.561
How's that for a girl's throw?

50:35.638 --> 50:36.900
Very funny.

50:39.309 --> 50:41.436
Well, look who's having fun.

50:43.113 --> 50:45.809
You know, l should go check on the train.

50:45.882 --> 50:47.611
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait.

50:48.918 --> 50:50.351
Hi, there.

50:50.420 --> 50:52.513
What are you?

50:52.589 --> 50:54.420
Well, l'm a wolf.

50:54.491 --> 50:58.222
l've never seen a wolf.
You are really strange.

50:58.661 --> 51:01.027
Am l now?

51:01.898 --> 51:03.331
You're totally weird.

51:07.370 --> 51:08.803
l'm going to get you!

51:12.442 --> 51:16.173
No. Look out! Look out!

51:20.917 --> 51:22.544
Okay, you asked for it.

51:26.890 --> 51:31.554
No, no, no. lt's okay. lt's okay.

51:32.328 --> 51:33.818
l'm really sorry.

51:39.202 --> 51:40.533
Oh, poo.

51:45.842 --> 51:47.002
Mad.. .

51:47.677 --> 51:48.666
Mad bear.

51:48.778 --> 51:52.441
Kate! Get the snowballs ready!
Mad bear on the attack!

51:57.620 --> 52:01.078
The Canadian Express!
Humphrey, the train is coming!

52:01.157 --> 52:02.556
Kate!

52:02.926 --> 52:04.291
Humphrey?

52:07.597 --> 52:08.723
What's wrong with you?

52:09.566 --> 52:10.555
That!

52:15.371 --> 52:17.202
Don't move. We can handle this.

52:17.273 --> 52:18.262
We can?

52:21.678 --> 52:23.009
Okay, we're in trouble.

52:24.080 --> 52:27.607
Guys. You guys like jokes? Good.

52:27.684 --> 52:32.383
So, okay. So two bears are eating a clown,
and one of the bears says,

52:32.455 --> 52:34.753
''Does this taste funny to you?''

52:39.929 --> 52:42.625
A simple ''Boo'' would have sufficed.

52:43.933 --> 52:44.922
Man.

53:00.750 --> 53:03.082
Watch this. One more. One more.

53:06.122 --> 53:07.646
Get up. Kate, get up.

53:12.228 --> 53:16.358
Where are those two?
Why must they make this so difficult?

53:16.432 --> 53:19.094
l believe the term is
''high maintenance couple,'' sir.

53:29.045 --> 53:31.513
Stuck between the cliffs and the claws.
This isn't good.

53:39.689 --> 53:41.680
Good luck joking your way out of this one.

53:42.692 --> 53:43.818
What's your name, sir?

53:45.295 --> 53:46.728
Growl. All right.

53:53.403 --> 53:54.597
Do you need a hug?

53:56.906 --> 53:58.874
Why don't we talk? Can we just talk?

54:02.745 --> 54:04.076
Good talk!

54:36.312 --> 54:37.540
Hey, need a ride?

54:38.982 --> 54:41.075
Jump! Trust me!

54:44.954 --> 54:46.615
l told you, you could trust me.

54:48.725 --> 54:50.158
Hang a left!

54:53.963 --> 54:55.225
Go right!

55:07.010 --> 55:08.409
Why are you looking at me like that?

55:15.118 --> 55:18.246
Unbelievable. They have missed the train.

55:24.727 --> 55:26.058
Or not.

55:49.118 --> 55:52.212
-l know. lt's not very good, is it?
-Well.. .

55:55.558 --> 55:58.186
That was so awesome.
You with the snowballs.

55:59.195 --> 56:03.791
And you with that little bear
in that snowball fight. lt was so cute.

56:06.469 --> 56:08.130
But then you with the log!

56:08.204 --> 56:10.138
The look on your face was so good.

56:10.907 --> 56:11.965
And then we.. .

56:15.244 --> 56:17.269
You know, we make a pretty good team.

56:17.347 --> 56:20.874
Kate and Humphrey, world adventurers!
What do you think?

56:21.584 --> 56:22.846
l think you're crazy.

56:22.919 --> 56:24.284
You think l'm.. .

56:24.354 --> 56:27.255
No, l'm telling you,
we're onto something here.

56:27.323 --> 56:28.813
Stick with me, pup. We'll go places.

56:30.626 --> 56:32.491
Well, l'll keep that in mind.

56:36.466 --> 56:39.435
All right. Take a deep breath.

56:39.869 --> 56:43.566
Howl from right here.

56:46.442 --> 56:47.875
And l'll join in.

57:03.626 --> 57:04.991
Humphrey,

57:05.828 --> 57:07.489
what are you doing?

57:07.563 --> 57:11.226
l'm sorry. The moon, the moment.
l just thought.. .

57:12.535 --> 57:16.096
Come on, Kate. Howl at the moon with me.

59:01.143 --> 59:02.701
See? That's so good.

59:09.252 --> 59:10.844
No. You better go.

59:10.920 --> 59:12.979
But no one has to know.

59:13.055 --> 59:15.888
Please. Go, now.

59:18.027 --> 59:19.016
No.

59:22.265 --> 59:23.323
Dad.

59:25.701 --> 59:28.499
Howling with an Omega, are we?

59:28.571 --> 59:30.539
-l was just.. .
-Get with the others.

59:31.140 --> 59:32.300
What's going on?

59:32.375 --> 59:34.138
We're going to take the valley,

59:34.911 --> 59:36.640
and our caribou.

59:48.691 --> 59:50.625
-Dad!
-Lilly, what's wrong?

59:50.693 --> 59:52.820
The Eastern Wolves. They're coming!

59:53.729 --> 59:54.957
Come on!

01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:10.308
Just do it.
She howled at the moon with you.

01:00:13.015 --> 01:00:14.414
That was just the moment.

01:00:14.884 --> 01:00:17.250
<i>Bonjour,</i> my furry friend.

01:00:18.154 --> 01:00:19.280
What?

01:00:23.826 --> 01:00:24.850
Are you guys crazy?

01:00:24.927 --> 01:00:26.189
That's up for debate.

01:00:26.262 --> 01:00:30.164
And where is.. . <i>Mademoiselle.</i>

01:00:30.232 --> 01:00:31.529
She's sleeping, so be quiet.

01:00:31.767 --> 01:00:33.064
Yes. Quiet.

01:00:45.514 --> 01:00:46.879
What are you guys doing here?

01:00:46.949 --> 01:00:50.350
Making sure that you don't forget
the run of the course.

01:00:50.419 --> 01:00:53.479
Jasper Park, it is a few miles up.

01:00:53.756 --> 01:00:55.621
Do not miss it.

01:00:55.691 --> 01:00:57.522
Jasper, few miles, got it.

01:00:57.593 --> 01:00:58.719
Good.

01:00:58.794 --> 01:01:03.493
l've got to say, your girlfriend
looks quite pretty when she sleeps.

01:01:04.767 --> 01:01:06.200
She's not my girlfriend.

01:01:08.838 --> 01:01:11.068
You should work on that.

01:01:38.868 --> 01:01:41.462
lt's the full moon, Winston.

01:01:41.937 --> 01:01:44.497
l can see that, Tony.

01:01:45.007 --> 01:01:47.373
l didn't want it to come to this.

01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:48.836
But here we are.

01:01:48.911 --> 01:01:51.641
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!

01:01:52.248 --> 01:01:55.445
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!

01:01:55.518 --> 01:01:58.214
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!
-Stop the insanity! Go organic!

01:02:25.214 --> 01:02:26.306
Kate.

01:02:27.717 --> 01:02:29.617
Kate, wake up. Wake up.

01:02:30.486 --> 01:02:33.546
Humphrey? Where are we?

01:02:34.090 --> 01:02:36.081
We're.. . We're in Jasper.

01:02:46.535 --> 01:02:47.695
We're home.

01:02:47.770 --> 01:02:50.295
Yup. We're home.

01:02:51.774 --> 01:02:53.332
-There's something.. .
-There's something.. .

01:02:53.876 --> 01:02:55.468
Please, you first.

01:02:56.645 --> 01:02:58.636
Humphrey, l just wanted to tell you,

01:02:58.714 --> 01:03:01.706
these past couple of days,
they've been, kind of,

01:03:03.018 --> 01:03:04.076
fun.

01:03:05.321 --> 01:03:08.347
You've been, kind of, fun.

01:03:09.291 --> 01:03:10.485
Really?

01:03:11.494 --> 01:03:12.859
Really.

01:03:12.928 --> 01:03:15.897
Well, that's.. . That's great.

01:03:15.965 --> 01:03:18.627
l told you, we make a pretty good team.

01:03:19.435 --> 01:03:20.925
We do.

01:03:23.706 --> 01:03:25.071
Okay.

01:03:25.741 --> 01:03:29.268
No, no, no. Don't tell me.
You have to go to the bathroom again.

01:03:29.345 --> 01:03:31.074
Why, do you see a truck stop?

01:03:33.249 --> 01:03:36.514
l just wanted to tell you l.. . l.. .

01:03:39.221 --> 01:03:42.019
-l.. . l just wanted to tell you.. .
-No.

01:03:42.091 --> 01:03:43.854
l.. . l love.. .

01:03:45.027 --> 01:03:46.358
Oh, geez.

01:03:52.034 --> 01:03:56.698
All l asked was for you
to follow our customs, unite the packs.

01:03:57.039 --> 01:04:00.975
But, no.
Your daughter had to up and run away.

01:04:01.043 --> 01:04:02.203
l didn't run away.

01:04:05.614 --> 01:04:06.774
Kate!

01:04:06.849 --> 01:04:08.248
She's back!

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:20.390
-We were so worried.
-Where have you been?

01:04:20.796 --> 01:04:22.923
-ln ldaho.
-ldaho?

01:04:23.399 --> 01:04:25.230
What were you doing in ldaho?

01:04:25.634 --> 01:04:28.330
We were taken by humans to another park.

01:04:28.404 --> 01:04:30.929
We were supposed to repopulate.

01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:37.579
No, no, no. Mom. We didn't repopulate.

01:04:37.646 --> 01:04:40.171
Humphrey actually helped me get home.

01:04:45.221 --> 01:04:46.882
What a nice boy.

01:04:47.423 --> 01:04:51.519
-l came back.. .
-You came back to marry Garth.

01:04:58.434 --> 01:04:59.423
Yes.

01:05:01.403 --> 01:05:03.166
And unite the packs!

01:05:15.985 --> 01:05:18.579
Good for the pack, good for the belly.

01:05:39.275 --> 01:05:42.506
Marry? You're getting married?

01:05:43.178 --> 01:05:46.113
Yes. lsn't it great?

01:05:46.916 --> 01:05:51.819
No more fighting during hunts.
No more scraps and bones at dinnertime.

01:05:52.354 --> 01:05:54.219
We're going to unite the packs.

01:06:04.066 --> 01:06:05.624
Welcome back, Humphrey.

01:06:05.701 --> 01:06:07.726
Good job bringing her home.

01:06:29.191 --> 01:06:32.490
Wow. lt's a big crowd.

01:06:33.362 --> 01:06:35.330
Yeah. Good times.

01:06:35.965 --> 01:06:38.934
So l heard
you and Garth spent some time together.

01:06:40.035 --> 01:06:41.127
Lilly.

01:06:41.203 --> 01:06:42.227
Sorry.

01:06:42.304 --> 01:06:44.636
l'm sure he's perfect marrying material.

01:06:47.142 --> 01:06:53.604
Well, if you like that sort of thing,
big, brawny, and perfect.

01:06:56.018 --> 01:06:57.883
Lilly, you're wearing your fur back.

01:06:58.721 --> 01:07:01.155
Sorry. l know.

01:07:03.592 --> 01:07:05.617
But, l liked it.

01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:09.857
Right on the pin.

01:07:10.566 --> 01:07:12.090
Marcel! Paddy!

01:07:12.568 --> 01:07:16.299
When it comes to hugs,
we are all French, Paddy?

01:07:16.405 --> 01:07:18.873
Well, l'm English, so we don't hug!

01:07:19.675 --> 01:07:22.143
But for a first, l'd say that was a good one.

01:07:22.211 --> 01:07:24.270
l'm so happy to see you two.

01:07:24.346 --> 01:07:26.280
We flew in to see that you made it home.

01:07:26.348 --> 01:07:28.111
And what do we find?

01:07:30.152 --> 01:07:32.518
-You're getting married!
-You're getting married!

01:07:34.423 --> 01:07:37.017
Yeah. l'm getting married.

01:07:37.092 --> 01:07:38.889
-Who told you?
-l did.

01:07:40.362 --> 01:07:41.829
Humphrey.

01:07:42.331 --> 01:07:44.231
We should be going.

01:07:44.299 --> 01:07:45.561
Yes, yes.

01:07:51.006 --> 01:07:53.474
Excuse me. A flea.

01:07:54.643 --> 01:07:57.077
And a little something for your big day.

01:07:58.180 --> 01:07:59.579
Thank you.

01:07:59.648 --> 01:08:01.081
Just wanted to say good-bye.

01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:02.681
Good-bye?

01:08:02.751 --> 01:08:05.049
Yeah. l'm thinking
about doing a little traveling,

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.213
you know, seeing where the train takes me.

01:08:08.157 --> 01:08:09.784
And maybe l'll visit our friends the bears.

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.923
Our old buddies, see how they're doing.

01:08:13.629 --> 01:08:15.062
l'll tell them you said hi.

01:08:17.198 --> 01:08:19.429
Wait. But you're leaving Jasper?

01:08:20.035 --> 01:08:23.630
Yeah. You know, it's a lone wolf thing.

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:28.403
l know Humphrey, the fun-loving Omega,

01:08:29.111 --> 01:08:31.908
not Humphrey, the lone wolf.

01:08:32.448 --> 01:08:34.848
So l'll be a fun-loving lone wolf.

01:08:40.889 --> 01:08:42.584
l don't doubt that.

01:08:45.394 --> 01:08:48.124
You know, Marcel,
l am a stickler for tradition,

01:08:48.197 --> 01:08:50.791
but this one, l just don't understand.

01:08:51.767 --> 01:08:54.930
These wolves are mysterious creatures.

01:09:10.853 --> 01:09:12.081
Tony.

01:09:12.888 --> 01:09:13.979
So.. .

01:09:16.558 --> 01:09:18.048
Are you ready?

01:09:18.861 --> 01:09:19.919
Yes.

01:09:20.595 --> 01:09:21.688
Good.

01:09:23.899 --> 01:09:25.366
Are you okay?

01:09:26.635 --> 01:09:27.932
You bet.

01:09:28.002 --> 01:09:29.868
No problems on this end.

01:09:29.938 --> 01:09:32.099
Ready to go, go, go.

01:09:35.978 --> 01:09:38.002
So, you want to start this thing or me?

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.341
We'll start together.

01:09:39.814 --> 01:09:41.715
Start together. Yeah.

01:09:41.783 --> 01:09:44.444
So, what's happening?

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.218
They're accepting each other's scent.

01:09:48.991 --> 01:09:51.357
And now, the nibble on the ears.

01:09:54.930 --> 01:09:56.522
Do you think l can make it?

01:09:56.598 --> 01:10:01.001
Yes, sir, and just as you hit the tracks,
you should see an open train car.

01:10:01.069 --> 01:10:06.336
Well, avoid truck stops, bears, and that
hideous dessert. What is it called?

01:10:06.408 --> 01:10:08.876
-Cupcakes, sir.
-Yes. Cupcakes.

01:10:08.944 --> 01:10:11.139
l will. Thanks, guys.

01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:14.278
You know, you shouldn't be so judgmental
about cupcakes.

01:10:14.349 --> 01:10:15.873
They really are quite delicious.

01:10:15.951 --> 01:10:17.543
l wouldn't know.

01:10:19.154 --> 01:10:24.182
And finally, they will rub noses
to symbolize that they are

01:10:25.894 --> 01:10:26.883
mates!

01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:46.338
Kate, what are you doing?

01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:48.207
l.. .

01:10:51.119 --> 01:10:53.053
l can't.

01:10:53.488 --> 01:10:54.819
You can't!

01:10:56.758 --> 01:10:58.749
l mean, you can't?

01:10:59.328 --> 01:11:02.195
What is this, Winston?
Why can't she marry Garth?

01:11:02.264 --> 01:11:03.424
Quiet.

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:07.364
Kate, Kate. Why can't you marry Garth?

01:11:08.036 --> 01:11:09.765
Because l.. .

01:11:11.673 --> 01:11:15.165
l fell in love with an Omega.

01:11:15.611 --> 01:11:16.942
An Omega?

01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:21.577
Humphrey? That sly dog!

01:11:35.697 --> 01:11:39.394
An Alpha in love with an Omega.
That's against pack law.

01:11:39.468 --> 01:11:40.730
Dad.

01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:44.639
l also am in love with an Omega.

01:11:45.941 --> 01:11:47.033
What?

01:11:48.710 --> 01:11:51.736
What have you done to my son, Winston?

01:11:51.813 --> 01:11:54.611
An Omega and an Alpha?
An Alpha and an Omega?

01:11:54.683 --> 01:11:56.844
Eve, help me out.

01:12:01.156 --> 01:12:05.092
This is madness. This isn't our custom.

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:08.994
This isn't our way. Take the valley!

01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:20.240
l just love weddings!

01:12:37.159 --> 01:12:39.821
Stampede! Stampede!

01:12:39.895 --> 01:12:42.728
Everyone, run! Run!

01:12:42.798 --> 01:12:44.993
To the sides of the valley!

01:12:53.975 --> 01:12:56.739
lt's that darn disk in my back.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.577
Come on!

01:13:09.191 --> 01:13:11.182
No! They're trapped!

01:13:19.301 --> 01:13:20.427
Humphrey!

01:13:20.502 --> 01:13:21.526
Kate!

01:13:21.603 --> 01:13:22.797
We have to help them!

01:13:24.639 --> 01:13:25.731
Look!

01:13:33.215 --> 01:13:34.807
Faster, Tony! Faster!

01:13:47.863 --> 01:13:49.125
Go left!

01:13:51.066 --> 01:13:52.590
Roll right!

01:13:55.036 --> 01:13:56.526
You're getting good at this.

01:13:56.605 --> 01:13:58.038
l had a good teacher.

01:14:00.575 --> 01:14:03.135
They're too far ahead. We'll never make it.

01:14:03.211 --> 01:14:04.508
Hold on.

01:14:12.621 --> 01:14:13.610
Look!

01:14:24.332 --> 01:14:25.993
World adventurers.

01:14:26.067 --> 01:14:27.728
l told you we'd make a good team.

01:14:27.803 --> 01:14:29.998
Did you say that? l thought l said that.

01:14:35.010 --> 01:14:36.102
Kate!

01:15:00.235 --> 01:15:01.930
Kate. Kate.

01:15:06.274 --> 01:15:07.673
Please, Kate.

01:15:09.778 --> 01:15:11.439
Please, you can't do this.

01:15:22.724 --> 01:15:24.089
l love you.

01:16:16.244 --> 01:16:17.336
Kate!

01:16:21.683 --> 01:16:22.945
Humphrey?

01:16:23.785 --> 01:16:24.877
l thought l'd lost you.

01:16:33.194 --> 01:16:34.684
ls everyone staring at us?

01:16:34.930 --> 01:16:39.333
Well, no, not.. . Not every.. . Well, yeah.
Now they are.

01:16:40.435 --> 01:16:43.268
Darn. 'Cause l wanted to tell you something.

01:16:47.509 --> 01:16:48.601
What?

01:16:50.946 --> 01:16:52.072
Really?

01:16:54.015 --> 01:16:57.507
Okay.
Well, l wanted to tell you something, too.

01:17:06.761 --> 01:17:09.491
Maybe this can work.

01:17:15.003 --> 01:17:16.493
All right.

01:17:16.571 --> 01:17:17.731
Garth!

01:17:28.717 --> 01:17:32.585
Tony, what do two old wolves do
after they retire?

01:17:32.687 --> 01:17:38.091
Gentlemen, may l introduce you to golf?

01:17:41.963 --> 01:17:42.952
Fore!

01:17:55.644 --> 01:17:57.009
Yeah, yeah.

01:17:57.646 --> 01:17:58.635
Oh, that's good.

01:18:08.623 --> 01:18:11.285
Come on, honey.
Let's show 'em how it's done.

01:18:11.359 --> 01:18:13.122
You ready to shake your tail?

01:18:21.336 --> 01:18:22.826
Now that's a howl.

01:18:40.055 --> 01:18:41.113
Are you ready?

01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:42.588
Yeah. Ready.
