WEBVTT

00:03.729 --> 00:05.421
(engine rumbling)

00:09.735 --> 00:10.968
(engine stops)

00:14.423 --> 00:15.830
(owl hooting)

00:15.850 --> 00:17.832
(sighs) Okay.

00:17.910 --> 00:21.078
Caleb, are you finally gonna
tell me what we're doing here?

00:21.096 --> 00:23.247
It might be
a moonlight picnic.

00:23.265 --> 00:24.690
Oh, what is that for?

00:24.841 --> 00:28.009
The most beautiful girl
in the world took me back...

00:28.029 --> 00:29.570
-again.
-(woman chuckles)

00:30.364 --> 00:31.938
That's sweet.

00:32.091 --> 00:33.574
What did you bring?

00:34.869 --> 00:36.851
Pretzels. Okay.

00:36.871 --> 00:39.763
And energy drinks,

00:39.765 --> 00:41.331
and, um...

00:43.210 --> 00:45.294
Caleb, is that all you brought?

00:46.047 --> 00:47.546
You hate it.

00:48.957 --> 00:49.956
No, no.

00:50.033 --> 00:52.384
No. Th... This is so nice.

00:52.945 --> 00:54.611
Bri...

00:54.630 --> 00:57.222
I know I haven't
always been there for you.

00:57.299 --> 01:00.450
Like at prom when I accidentally
took the limo home without you

01:00.469 --> 01:03.378
or that time I was late
to your sister's wedding.

01:03.455 --> 01:05.289
Well, you had
the wrong week.

01:05.291 --> 01:08.067
Or in the tornado, when I hid
in my dad's gun safe.

01:08.143 --> 01:09.551
Yeah, and left me to die.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.987
But I promise things are
gonna be different this time.

01:13.223 --> 01:15.324
I'm never gonna leave you
hanging again.

01:15.801 --> 01:16.992
I swear.

01:17.970 --> 01:19.078
(twig snaps)

01:19.229 --> 01:20.804
Caleb, what was that?

01:20.823 --> 01:22.322
(rustling)

01:22.399 --> 01:25.292
-CALEB: What?
-Did you not hear that sound?

01:26.662 --> 01:27.920
(crow cawing)

01:28.071 --> 01:30.255
Get behind me. I got you.

01:31.926 --> 01:34.009
Holy crap, what are those?

01:36.097 --> 01:38.989
(dramatic, eerie music playing)

01:38.991 --> 01:40.557
Aliens!

01:43.437 --> 01:45.753
-(ATV engine revving)
-Caleb. Dammit!

01:45.831 --> 01:47.589
Caleb, you little bitch!

01:47.666 --> 01:49.024
Caleb!

01:49.685 --> 01:51.026
Seriously?

01:55.023 --> 01:56.657
(Caleb screaming)

02:00.696 --> 02:02.663
(sirens wailing)

02:06.794 --> 02:07.851
Wanna tell us what happened?

02:07.853 --> 02:09.353
Yeah, my boyfriend got spooked

02:09.521 --> 02:11.446
when these like
blue glowy creatures
came out of the woods

02:11.523 --> 02:13.857
and he wrecked his ATV
into a barbed-wire fence

02:13.859 --> 02:14.800
and now he's stuck.

02:14.951 --> 02:16.193
How fast was he going?

02:16.211 --> 02:17.544
He had reached
ass-hauling velocity.

02:17.696 --> 02:19.138
Are we just gonna
ignore the part about

02:19.247 --> 02:19.972
the blue glowing creatures?

02:20.048 --> 02:21.047
BRIANNA: They're gone now,

02:21.200 --> 02:22.866
but Caleb thought
they were aliens.

02:22.885 --> 02:23.958
Ooh, aliens?

02:24.052 --> 02:24.959
Um, Brianna, have you
and your boyfriend

02:24.979 --> 02:25.978
been drinking tonight?

02:26.129 --> 02:27.813
Any substances
we should know about?

02:27.890 --> 02:29.022
No.

02:29.799 --> 02:31.375
(Caleb screaming)

02:31.393 --> 02:32.800
BRIANNA:
Help's here, Caleb.

02:32.820 --> 02:33.986
-CALEB: Brianna?
-BRIANNA: Yeah.

02:34.137 --> 02:35.912
You didn't get abducted?

02:35.914 --> 02:37.214
No, no thanks to you.

02:37.232 --> 02:39.733
(Caleb screaming)

02:39.885 --> 02:41.809
Caleb, Caleb, I'm Tommy.

02:41.829 --> 02:42.977
Alright, I need to stop moving

02:42.997 --> 02:44.721
so that we can take
a look at you, okay?

02:44.723 --> 02:46.556
Did you see them?
Are they still there?

02:46.575 --> 02:48.725
I think... I think
I heard their ship.

02:48.744 --> 02:50.243
No, baby. I think
you heard the fire truck.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.153
Alright, just stay still.

02:52.173 --> 02:54.173
Nancy, get him on fluids
and a LIFEPAK.

02:54.249 --> 02:57.250
TK, monitor his vitals
and keep him calm.

02:57.327 --> 02:58.993
-TK: Copy that.
-(Caleb groaning)

02:59.071 --> 03:00.404
Those barbs are in there deep.

03:00.422 --> 03:01.755
He's lost
a fair amount of blood.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.332
Frankly, it's a miracle
that he hasn't torn an artery.

03:04.384 --> 03:06.351
Alright, Judd, Marwani,
you guys get the clippers.

03:06.428 --> 03:09.170
Paul, Mateo, you gotta
hold him nice and steady.

03:09.190 --> 03:10.505
We gotta get him out of there
fast and easy.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.082
-(Caleb breathing heavily)
-Cap, he's panicking.

03:12.100 --> 03:13.266
Heart's racing in the 110s, Cap.

03:13.419 --> 03:14.676
TOMMY: Go get the basket.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.010
(Caleb groaning)

03:16.088 --> 03:17.845
OWEN:
Caleb? Caleb? Shh.

03:17.923 --> 03:19.198
Hey. My name's Owen.

03:19.274 --> 03:21.867
I wanna talk to you about
those beings that you saw.

03:22.018 --> 03:24.519
Your girlfriend said that
they were blue and glowing?

03:24.596 --> 03:27.706
Yeah, like, uh,
Smurfs but taller.

03:27.857 --> 03:28.949
Like Avatar?

03:29.025 --> 03:30.209
I-I didn't see a tail.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.211
Brianna, did you see a tail?

03:32.287 --> 03:35.380
No, I just saw your tail
when you bailed on me.

03:35.532 --> 03:38.050
I'm not crazy.
They're out there.

03:38.126 --> 03:39.443
I know. I know they are.

03:39.461 --> 03:41.053
What you saw
were called Cobalts.

03:41.129 --> 03:42.779
They're harmless
civilization builders.

03:42.781 --> 03:46.116
In fact, they're the ones that
Eisenhower made the pact with

03:46.134 --> 03:47.375
in order to gain
the advanced technology.

03:47.453 --> 03:49.377
I don't... I don't know
who that is.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.712
He was the President
of the United States,

03:50.731 --> 03:52.064
and he won World War II.

03:52.291 --> 03:54.900
Now, if you'd had found Greys
coming out of the woods,

03:55.051 --> 03:57.477
that would be a different thing
'cause they are the worker bees.

03:57.554 --> 03:59.220
They're involved
in human abductions.

03:59.298 --> 04:01.222
Happily, there's less and less
of that going on now

04:01.300 --> 04:02.908
because they pretty much have

04:02.985 --> 04:04.150
all the DNA information
they need.

04:04.303 --> 04:05.819
-CALEB: They do?
-OWEN: Yeah, that's right.

04:05.895 --> 04:07.395
So, believe me when I tell you,

04:07.414 --> 04:09.306
the creatures you encountered
came in peace.

04:09.324 --> 04:10.398
-CALEB: For real?
-OWEN: For real.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.917
Now if you can just relax

04:12.068 --> 04:13.310
and hold still
so we can get you out?

04:13.328 --> 04:16.313
Yeah, I mean, um...
Yes, sir.

04:16.331 --> 04:17.981
Okay, good, we're gonna
get you out of here. Let's go.

04:18.000 --> 04:18.832
Come on.

04:18.908 --> 04:21.260
(tense music)

04:25.933 --> 04:28.225
(Caleb groaning)

04:29.770 --> 04:30.918
(Caleb winces)

04:30.996 --> 04:33.163
You're doing great, Caleb.

04:33.181 --> 04:36.333
Alright, just a,
just a few more cuts.

04:36.351 --> 04:38.277
-Oh, okay.
-(Caleb groaning)

04:39.763 --> 04:41.262
Last one.

04:41.340 --> 04:43.865
Alright, son, we're
about to bring you down.

04:45.101 --> 04:47.935
-Two, three. There you go.
-(Caleb wincing)

04:47.955 --> 04:49.604
Okay. There you go. Perfect.

04:49.681 --> 04:52.365
(Caleb groaning)

04:52.518 --> 04:55.018
Is it cool if I ride with him,
just to make sure he's okay?

04:55.037 --> 04:56.110
Oh, yeah, of course.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.021
Bri, does this mean
you still love me?

04:58.023 --> 04:59.447
BRIANNA: No, no,
we are still broken up,

04:59.525 --> 05:02.301
but unlike you, Caleb,
I don't abandon people.

05:02.377 --> 05:04.377
MATEO: I gotta say,
that was pretty clever, Cap.

05:04.530 --> 05:06.120
PAUL:
Yeah, Cobalts. Eisenhower.

05:06.198 --> 05:07.455
That was some
fast thinking, Cap.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.791
Yeah. The way you were
able to calm that kid down

05:09.810 --> 05:10.809
with your alien B.S.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.627
Oh, it's no B.S.
It's true.

05:12.704 --> 05:13.795
-Google it.
-MATEO: Cap.

05:13.872 --> 05:17.040
You're not saying
you believe in aliens?

05:17.059 --> 05:19.634
Who do you think
built the pyramids?

05:19.653 --> 05:20.894
The Egyptians.

05:21.046 --> 05:22.529
(laughing)

05:23.657 --> 05:24.656
Okay.

05:24.733 --> 05:27.743
(theme music plays)

05:29.888 --> 05:31.145
JUDD: Oh, no, no, no.

05:31.223 --> 05:32.497
-Damn it!
-What is it?

05:32.649 --> 05:34.741
The bark came off
of the brisket.

05:34.893 --> 05:35.983
It dried out.

05:36.061 --> 05:37.077
I was putting the baby down,

05:37.229 --> 05:38.578
I lost track of time
and I ruined it.

05:38.730 --> 05:40.672
And now we don't even
have time to order pizza

05:40.824 --> 05:42.065
before Wyatt gets here.

05:42.084 --> 05:43.750
I mean, I'm sure it's fine.

05:43.902 --> 05:45.385
Imma taste it, okay?

05:45.846 --> 05:47.262
JUDD: Yeah.

05:48.998 --> 05:50.682
Oh, Judd.

05:50.834 --> 05:53.852
The mesquite is on point.
It's delicious, sweetheart.

05:54.003 --> 05:55.169
Oh, I know
that it tastes good.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.022
I'm talking about the texture.

05:57.173 --> 05:59.583
Listen, you might be putting

05:59.585 --> 06:01.860
a little too much pressure
on this visit.

06:02.011 --> 06:05.438
Already let this kid down for
the first 17 years of his life.

06:05.591 --> 06:07.515
Baby, you didn't know
you had a son until last week.

06:07.534 --> 06:10.994
You did not let him down.
He knows that already.

06:13.615 --> 06:15.499
But growing up
without a father...

06:17.360 --> 06:20.587
I mean, that must have
given him some scars.

06:22.049 --> 06:25.032
But he has a father now, Judd.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.444
All of those scars
are gonna heal.

06:27.446 --> 06:29.796
Even if the brisket
eats like beef jerky.

06:29.873 --> 06:31.556
Oh, my God.

06:31.708 --> 06:32.557
(Grace chuckles)

06:32.709 --> 06:35.143
(inhales) Pow.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.881
GRACE:
Wyatt, we are so excited
that you're staying with us.

06:39.900 --> 06:40.974
We really are.

06:41.126 --> 06:42.717
I'm excited to be here,
Mrs. Ryder.

06:42.794 --> 06:43.885
Thank you for hosting me.

06:43.962 --> 06:46.071
Of course.
Please call me Grace.

06:46.222 --> 06:48.448
Here you go. That's brisket.

06:49.392 --> 06:51.326
I know it's a little bit dry.

06:52.061 --> 06:54.304
I mean, if you wanna...

06:54.322 --> 06:56.081
put some barbecue sauce
or whatever on.

06:56.232 --> 06:58.417
Oh, it's okay. I don't eat it.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.585
That's my boy.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.046
I meant the meat.

07:05.150 --> 07:06.675
Oh, you don't eat meat?

07:08.262 --> 07:10.011
Like ever?

07:11.098 --> 07:12.322
Okay. No problem.

07:12.340 --> 07:14.157
Look here, have a double serving

07:14.159 --> 07:16.176
of Grace's truffle mac.

07:16.328 --> 07:17.752
I can't.

07:17.829 --> 07:19.396
I'm vegan, actually.

07:20.849 --> 07:22.256
-Oh.
-GRACE: Ugh.

07:22.334 --> 07:25.185
Honey, I am so sorry,
I did not know.

07:25.261 --> 07:28.171
Oh, no, it's my fault,
I should have said something.

07:28.173 --> 07:31.024
I didn't wanna be presumptuous.
I'm the worst.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.175
-No, no, no.
-No.

07:32.194 --> 07:33.618
Listen, I will fix you
something else.

07:33.770 --> 07:36.362
-I think we have
lentils, actually.
-No, no, please.

07:36.439 --> 07:39.032
I'm-I'm good with
the cornbread and the salad.

07:39.184 --> 07:40.709
Oh, damn it.

07:41.795 --> 07:42.961
What's wrong?

07:43.112 --> 07:44.278
The whole weekend
I had planned

07:44.298 --> 07:46.189
with Wyatt's ruined
is what's wrong.

07:46.191 --> 07:48.115
What do you mean?
I'm sure it's--

07:48.135 --> 07:50.284
Tomorrow, I was gonna
take you deer huntin'.

07:50.304 --> 07:53.287
-Oh.
-Well, how about
you just move up

07:53.365 --> 07:55.031
what you had planned for Sunday?

07:55.050 --> 07:57.124
It was bass fishing.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.218
-Yeah.
-GRACE: Okay, yeah.

07:58.370 --> 08:00.203
That's, uh, that's
not gonna work, either.

08:00.222 --> 08:01.705
Thank you for that, Grace.
Yeah.

08:01.723 --> 08:03.273
(cracks knuckles)

08:05.468 --> 08:09.045
Well, how about this,
how about you ask Wyatt

08:09.064 --> 08:10.697
what he likes to do for fun?

08:11.399 --> 08:12.974
That's great.

08:13.051 --> 08:14.234
Wyatt... (clears throat)

08:14.310 --> 08:16.661
...what do you like
to do for fun?

08:16.738 --> 08:18.413
I like to skate.

08:19.908 --> 08:21.057
Do you, do you skate?

08:21.059 --> 08:22.984
On a skateboard?

08:23.003 --> 08:25.462
Man, I haven't been
on a skateboard since...

08:27.508 --> 08:30.491
No-- I don't think
I've ever been on a skateboard.

08:30.569 --> 08:32.660
Okay, well, that's fine,
we don't have to do that.

08:32.679 --> 08:33.845
What else are you into?

08:34.014 --> 08:39.017
I like making TikToks,
uh, play a lot of "Magic."

08:39.094 --> 08:41.911
That's cool. That's cool.

08:41.930 --> 08:43.096
Like you do card tricks

08:43.172 --> 08:45.098
and rabbits
from the hat and all that?

08:45.174 --> 08:47.267
No, it's-it's
"Magic: The Gathering."

08:47.419 --> 08:50.487
It's like a fantasy-based
tabletop card game.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.615
I'm sorry. I'm kinda weird.

08:55.927 --> 08:57.369
Weird, huh?

09:00.098 --> 09:01.665
You like aliens?

09:02.617 --> 09:04.284
Aliens?

09:04.436 --> 09:09.548
TOMMY: Our 15th anniversary
would have been this week.

09:12.294 --> 09:15.053
Yeah, it's hard to believe
ten months have passed

09:15.204 --> 09:18.265
since Charles died.

09:20.452 --> 09:22.727
But the truth is
that I don't feel like

09:22.879 --> 09:25.305
I have any more closure today

09:25.457 --> 09:28.291
than I did
the night that I found him.

09:28.293 --> 09:30.977
And there's-there's
this-this part of me

09:31.129 --> 09:34.055
that feels like
I'm going to see him

09:34.132 --> 09:35.699
when I walk through the door...

09:39.896 --> 09:41.496
just standing there.

09:43.900 --> 09:45.375
But he's not there.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.964
And he never will be.

09:51.741 --> 09:53.049
Because he's gone.

09:55.654 --> 09:56.595
He's gone.

09:58.990 --> 10:00.515
And I'm still here.

10:04.329 --> 10:06.479
And I don't know
how I feel about that.

10:14.522 --> 10:17.190
-Hey, Mrs. Beasley.
-Hello, Mrs. Vega.

10:17.266 --> 10:18.191
How was it tonight?

10:18.267 --> 10:21.411
It was lovely, actually.

10:22.180 --> 10:24.530
-Thank you.
-Mm.

10:24.683 --> 10:28.442
Um, did I make it home in time
to tuck in the girls?

10:28.462 --> 10:31.354
Yes, but they're not
in their bedroom.

10:31.356 --> 10:33.298
They're in yours.

10:33.950 --> 10:35.783
Oh. Okay.

10:35.861 --> 10:39.212
They really wanted
to watch "Ghostbusters" and--

10:39.364 --> 10:41.214
Oh, how bad
are we talking here?

10:41.366 --> 10:43.290
EVIE:
<i> Our house is haunted.</i>

10:43.310 --> 10:46.035
Our house is not haunted.

10:46.037 --> 10:47.461
Why would you think
something like that?

10:47.481 --> 10:51.316
The lights in our room,
they all started flickering.

10:51.393 --> 10:54.043
The lights were flickering,
so you think we have ghosts?

10:54.062 --> 10:55.879
Not just flickering.

10:55.897 --> 10:57.563
They did it in a pattern.

10:57.640 --> 10:58.882
Like one time,

10:58.900 --> 11:01.067
four times, three times.

11:01.144 --> 11:02.994
Over and over.

11:03.146 --> 11:04.237
IZZY: They did not.

11:04.389 --> 11:05.889
It was just a stupid bulb

11:05.891 --> 11:07.056
blinking on and off!

11:07.075 --> 11:08.725
EVIE: No, it was Zuul.

11:08.727 --> 11:10.226
IZZY: It was not Zuul!

11:10.245 --> 11:11.244
EVIE: How do you know?

11:11.320 --> 11:12.896
IZZY: Because ghosts
aren't real,

11:12.914 --> 11:13.988
you big baby.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.733
(meowing)

11:16.735 --> 11:19.085
Hey, Buster.

11:19.162 --> 11:21.596
Oh, no, you're not
getting any of that.

11:23.909 --> 11:25.475
(meowing)

11:26.002 --> 11:28.019
(crackling)

11:33.268 --> 11:35.985
One. One, two, three, four.

11:38.014 --> 11:39.698
One, two, three.

11:42.536 --> 11:43.993
Charles.

11:51.360 --> 11:52.952
-(knock on door)
-Come in!

11:53.104 --> 11:54.028
(door opens)

11:54.047 --> 11:55.380
Hey, Judd. What's up?

11:55.531 --> 11:57.865
Sorry if I'm
interrupting anything, uh...

11:57.943 --> 11:59.366
You, you makin' soup?

11:59.444 --> 12:02.128
It's 8:00 a.m.
I'm not a psychopath.

12:02.280 --> 12:05.056
It's-it's golden milk,
a turmeric-based superfood.

12:05.133 --> 12:06.224
You want some?

12:06.301 --> 12:07.392
No. As a, as a rule,

12:07.543 --> 12:10.228
I never have
any turmeric before noon.

12:11.881 --> 12:13.064
What's going on?

12:13.808 --> 12:15.458
(exhales) Well...

12:15.477 --> 12:17.961
guess there ain't no
right way to put this, Cap.

12:17.963 --> 12:19.386
Uh... (clears throat)

12:19.406 --> 12:23.742
It's, uh, it's come to my
attention recently that, uh...

12:24.894 --> 12:26.327
I have a son.

12:27.730 --> 12:28.821
As in?

12:28.898 --> 12:30.156
As in a masculine child.

12:30.308 --> 12:32.250
As in, a second child

12:32.401 --> 12:34.310
other than your
newborn baby daughter?

12:34.329 --> 12:37.088
Yeah. Actually,
Charlie's my second

12:37.165 --> 12:40.258
because Wyatt preceded her
by about 17 years.

12:40.409 --> 12:43.410
And may I ask
how Grace is taking this?

12:43.488 --> 12:45.838
Well, I mean, yeah,
it gave her a turn at first.

12:45.991 --> 12:47.156
But you know Grace,

12:47.175 --> 12:49.158
she's-she's living up
to her name.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.603
It was actually her idea
that we, uh...

12:51.754 --> 12:54.255
we host the boy this weekend
to get to know him.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.848
And yet here you are.

12:55.925 --> 12:57.350
Yeah, here I am, hat in hand

12:57.426 --> 13:00.278
because, you know, that boy
may have half of my DNA,

13:00.429 --> 13:03.172
but apart from that,
we don't have a lick in common.

13:03.174 --> 13:05.358
Well, I'm flattered
that you came to me.

13:05.434 --> 13:08.011
I'm happy to share
any hard-learned knowledge

13:08.013 --> 13:10.437
I have about
raising a young man.

13:10.515 --> 13:13.107
Well, I appreciate
that, Cap, but...

13:13.184 --> 13:15.034
that's not really
why I'm here.

13:15.186 --> 13:17.020
Why are you here?

13:17.022 --> 13:19.856
(clears throat)
Aliens.

13:19.874 --> 13:21.282
-Aliens?
-Yeah.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.876
After hearing your little
impromptu spiel the other night,

13:24.029 --> 13:24.877
I figured you know
more about aliens

13:25.030 --> 13:26.362
than anybody I ever met.

13:26.531 --> 13:30.700
No, not any more than any other
card-carrying member MUFON.

13:30.718 --> 13:31.884
Why?

13:32.037 --> 13:33.961
Well, so I was hoping

13:34.039 --> 13:35.814
that you might take Wyatt and I

13:35.890 --> 13:40.318
on a little extraterrestrial
spotting excursion.

13:40.395 --> 13:42.320
And I read on the Internet
that they come back

13:42.397 --> 13:44.322
to the same places a lot
because they're trying

13:44.399 --> 13:47.550
to set up their, uh,
their landing pad?

13:47.569 --> 13:48.885
Well, that's true, Judd.

13:49.054 --> 13:53.890
But the real question is,
do you believe in aliens?

13:53.892 --> 13:57.243
I got a 17-year-old Texas boy

13:57.395 --> 14:00.396
who doesn't eat meat
and who's never fired a gun

14:00.415 --> 14:02.565
that wasn't plugged
into a video game console.

14:02.584 --> 14:08.263
So, for me, that's about
as alien as I can imagine.

14:09.999 --> 14:11.349
Alright. We'll do it.

14:11.426 --> 14:13.910
I'll pack up
my alien-huntin' gear.
We'll go.

14:13.928 --> 14:15.411
(chuckles)
You, you got gear?

14:15.413 --> 14:17.272
OWEN (scoffs):
Oh, do I have gear?

14:19.767 --> 14:24.028
LIZA:
I know this sounds crazy,
but I think I've been cursed.

14:24.180 --> 14:26.739
Nothing sounds crazy
to the Skinny Lady.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.184
When I left my ex Julian,

14:30.203 --> 14:32.853
and he said that
he would ruin my life,

14:32.931 --> 14:35.264
and ever since our divorce...

14:35.266 --> 14:38.951
I've been feeling,
I don't know, different.

14:39.104 --> 14:41.528
Different how?

14:41.548 --> 14:46.200
Like, there is this pain,
this sickness deep inside me.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.262
Like something
is sucking my life force.

14:50.706 --> 14:51.964
(mumbles, sniffles)

14:52.041 --> 14:53.516
I found this.

14:54.953 --> 14:56.978
It was under
my bedroom window.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.731
<i> Objecto maligno.</i>

15:00.642 --> 15:01.566
Evil object.

15:01.809 --> 15:04.994
I think Julian used it
to put a hex on me.

15:04.996 --> 15:06.905
But nobody'll believe me.

15:06.981 --> 15:09.132
I believe you.

15:09.150 --> 15:11.801
Your health flame
is the weakest.

15:11.819 --> 15:13.319
And the black is the strongest.

15:13.471 --> 15:15.821
Black represents dark energy.

15:15.974 --> 15:18.082
It is gathered all around you.

15:18.234 --> 15:19.900
What can you do to fix it?

15:19.920 --> 15:22.511
I cannot.
It is up to you.

15:22.513 --> 15:24.923
You've spent your relationship
fearing this man Julian,

15:24.999 --> 15:26.573
-have you not?
-Yes.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.410
That is the source
of the curse's power.

15:29.429 --> 15:33.156
You must face your fear of him
and confront the darkness.

15:33.174 --> 15:35.416
That is the only way
to break the curse.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.084
But I don't want to
confront the darkness.

15:37.162 --> 15:38.661
That's why I came to you.

15:38.663 --> 15:42.565
Can't you do some sort of
cleansing or...

15:43.017 --> 15:45.759
(groaning)

15:45.837 --> 15:47.670
Liza, are you alright?

15:47.689 --> 15:49.021
I... I...

15:49.174 --> 15:51.023
(sneezes)

15:51.176 --> 15:53.993
(screaming)

16:00.443 --> 16:03.461
She's in here. Hurry!
The curse has overtaken her!

16:03.612 --> 16:05.538
This curse have any symptoms
you can tell us about?

16:05.690 --> 16:08.800
MARTA: The darkness
is consuming her spirit!

16:08.876 --> 16:11.552
-Also, tentacles.
-Tentacles?

16:12.197 --> 16:14.213
Oh. Tentacles.

16:14.290 --> 16:15.715
LIZA: Please just
get it out of me!

16:15.791 --> 16:16.957
Please, just...

16:17.051 --> 16:18.792
Alright, alright.
We'll do everything that we can.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.228
Okay.

16:21.889 --> 16:23.147
-Her name?
-Liza.

16:23.299 --> 16:25.149
Liza, I need you to
hold still for me, okay?

16:25.301 --> 16:28.044
And you should close
your eyes for this part.

16:28.046 --> 16:29.529
A little tug.

16:30.773 --> 16:31.881
(coughing)

16:31.883 --> 16:33.232
Yeah.

16:33.384 --> 16:35.551
-Ah.
-LIZA: What is that?

16:35.570 --> 16:38.387
Uh, roundworm,
by the looks of it.

16:38.389 --> 16:41.416
-Where did it come from?
-TOMMY: One more.

16:42.485 --> 16:46.412
Probably something
that you ate.

16:46.564 --> 16:48.989
That's impossible.
I eat clean.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.325
All organic, from farm-to-table.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.160
Clean and organic aren't
always the same thing.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.255
Next time,
wash your veggies thoroughly.

16:56.332 --> 16:59.075
Roundworm is transmitted
through feces.

16:59.093 --> 17:00.184
What do you mean?

17:00.261 --> 17:02.411
She's saying some other stuff

17:02.413 --> 17:05.005
went from the farm
to your table to...

17:05.083 --> 17:06.691
-TOMMY: Nancy.
-You mean, I...

17:06.842 --> 17:08.417
NANCY: Barf bag.

17:08.436 --> 17:10.586
-(Liza coughs)
-Get it all out.

17:10.588 --> 17:12.179
(Liza retching)

17:12.257 --> 17:13.439
-NANCY: Cap.
-TOMMY: Liza.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.350
-(choking) I can't... breathe.
-Liza, are you okay?

17:16.369 --> 17:17.943
She must have aspirated
some of the material.

17:18.096 --> 17:19.996
-TK, track her O2 levels.
-TK: Okay.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.040
She's satting at 90, Cap.

17:22.191 --> 17:23.207
TOMMY: Her airway's blocked.

17:23.434 --> 17:26.044
-Nancy, grab me the SEADUC.
-NANCY: Copy.

17:26.120 --> 17:27.861
She's tachycardic, Cap.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.047
Cap, no pulse.

17:29.198 --> 17:30.214
-(monitor beeping steadily)
-Come on.

17:30.366 --> 17:33.109
-(monitor chirps)
-Here we go. Here we go.

17:33.127 --> 17:34.594
(suctioning)

17:43.563 --> 17:46.314
-It should be clear. Anything?
-Still nothing.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.233
Nancy, start compressions.

17:49.385 --> 17:51.069
Santisima Muerte, La Blanca,

17:51.145 --> 17:52.737
with your presence,
you can fight

17:52.888 --> 17:54.297
all hexes and evil curses.

17:54.299 --> 17:55.740
I ask that you separate Liza

17:55.891 --> 17:56.849
from that which crosses,

17:57.001 --> 17:58.392
that which is unclean.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.228
By your great power,
heal this woman!

18:01.247 --> 18:02.488
(gasps)

18:02.565 --> 18:05.324
-We've got her back.
-LIZA: Oh, my God!

18:05.476 --> 18:06.459
Oh, my God!

18:07.645 --> 18:09.236
TOMMY: It's okay.
It's alright, Liza.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.571
You're gonna be just fine.

18:10.648 --> 18:12.924
We're gonna take you
to the hospital now, okay?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.166
Alright.

18:14.319 --> 18:15.835
-TK?
-TK: Mm-hmm.

18:15.911 --> 18:17.762
Save that for Pathology.

18:17.839 --> 18:19.155
And for my nightmares.

18:19.157 --> 18:20.506
LIZA:
It was just like you said,

18:20.583 --> 18:23.843
the darkness came over me,
but I fought back.

18:23.919 --> 18:24.844
Back to the light.

18:24.996 --> 18:26.846
The curse has been lifted.

18:26.998 --> 18:28.272
Thank you.

18:34.839 --> 18:35.696
(speaking Spanish)

18:43.698 --> 18:44.997
(speaking Spanish)

19:03.384 --> 19:04.976
JUDD:
Cap, isn't this about
where that couple said

19:05.127 --> 19:07.052
they saw the,
uh, little blue fellers?

19:07.129 --> 19:10.464
OWEN:
Cobalts, and technically
they're not little.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.391
-It's the "Cobalts."
-Oh, hang on.

19:12.543 --> 19:14.485
-Gamma rays.
-JUDD: You foolin'?

19:14.637 --> 19:16.470
Yeah, no, I mean, it's nothing
lethal or anything, but...

19:16.489 --> 19:18.397
-(Geiger clicking)
-...something was here.

19:18.474 --> 19:19.732
That's so cool.

19:20.067 --> 19:22.326
OWEN:
Alright, so I don't think
we should go any further.

19:22.478 --> 19:23.477
We're downwind of it.

19:23.888 --> 19:25.646
We've got good cover
and an unobstructed eye-line.

19:25.707 --> 19:28.833
I think this is a good place
to set up our observation post.

19:28.984 --> 19:30.651
By set up our observation post,

19:30.728 --> 19:32.986
you mean kinda throw
our blankets down here?

19:33.064 --> 19:34.297
Yeah.

19:35.066 --> 19:36.549
-Over here?
-Yeah.

19:38.994 --> 19:42.496
So, Wyatt, you, uh...

19:42.515 --> 19:45.999
You got like a girlfriend
or anything up there in Waco?

19:46.077 --> 19:48.335
Uh, no, not really.

19:48.413 --> 19:49.412
Really?

19:49.430 --> 19:51.080
I thought you'd be kinda
beatin' 'em back

19:51.098 --> 19:52.523
with a stick by now.

19:52.675 --> 19:56.194
I mean, you know,
unless you're not into girls,

19:56.270 --> 19:58.421
if you're into guys, there ain't
nothing wrong with that.

19:58.423 --> 20:01.365
Uh, no, I like girls.
I just, um...

20:01.517 --> 20:04.660
I don't know. I guess
I never really needed a stick.

20:05.112 --> 20:06.037
Hmm.

20:06.113 --> 20:07.947
OWEN:
Snacks? Who wants snacks?

20:08.099 --> 20:09.432
Can't hunt aliens
without snacks.

20:09.434 --> 20:11.116
Well, yeah,
unless it's jerky.

20:11.269 --> 20:13.002
Wyatt here is a, uh...

20:14.047 --> 20:15.195
he's a vegan.

20:15.215 --> 20:16.455
-Oh, no way.
-Yeah.

20:16.607 --> 20:18.441
Well, that's good.
I tried to go vegan for a while,

20:18.443 --> 20:20.609
but a man can only eat
so many beans.

20:20.611 --> 20:23.370
Well, you'd be amazed
with what they could do
with heme nowadays.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.114
OWEN: It's funny you say that,
I've been thinking about heme.

20:25.132 --> 20:26.282
I need to eat some more things
with heme in it.

20:26.284 --> 20:27.283
You should do it. For sure.

20:27.301 --> 20:29.268
Heme's like a game changer.

20:29.878 --> 20:31.896
It's he... heme?

20:32.047 --> 20:33.439
BOTH:
Soy leghemoglobin.

20:35.142 --> 20:36.642
WYATT:
Uh, yeah, it's... (laughs)

20:36.794 --> 20:39.987
It's the stuff that makes
veggie burgers bleed.

20:42.300 --> 20:46.077
Wait, why-why would you want
your veggie burger to bleed?

20:46.228 --> 20:48.079
Don't that kinda
defeat the point?

20:48.230 --> 20:49.396
-Uh...
-Uh, well...

20:49.415 --> 20:51.999
Uh, it's kinda hard
to explain, I guess.

20:53.661 --> 20:56.570
Alright. Who wants
some teriyaki seaweed chips?

20:56.589 --> 20:58.589
Yeah, I love
teriyaki seaweed chips.

20:58.741 --> 21:00.649
Where'd you find those?
I could never find 'em anywhere.

21:00.651 --> 21:02.593
-Oh, I have my sources.
-WYATT: Oh, yeah?

21:04.097 --> 21:05.763
Now we just sit back...

21:07.082 --> 21:08.516
watch the skies.

21:11.178 --> 21:14.689
(eerie music playing)

21:19.170 --> 21:20.403
<i> Discúlpeme.</i>

21:21.781 --> 21:25.449
I probably should have called
to make an appointment.

21:27.102 --> 21:28.577
I was expecting you.

21:31.365 --> 21:34.199
Today, you said that, um...

21:34.276 --> 21:36.276
You thought someone
was trying to contact me,

21:36.296 --> 21:38.445
and I believe that's true.

21:38.464 --> 21:43.050
Some things have been happening
the past few nights.

21:44.304 --> 21:47.379
The lights in my house,
they've been flickering.

21:47.532 --> 21:49.598
-Flickering?
-TOMMY: Not, um...

21:50.292 --> 21:52.051
Not just flickering,

21:52.127 --> 21:55.220
more like... signaling.

21:55.297 --> 21:57.206
Always in the same pattern.

21:57.224 --> 22:01.301
They blink once,
then four times, then three.

22:01.362 --> 22:04.030
Do these numbers
mean anything to you?

22:05.232 --> 22:06.991
I think it's my husband.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.310
He died last year.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.221
When we first started dating,

22:12.239 --> 22:14.999
I was an EMT
and Charles was a line cook

22:15.150 --> 22:18.336
and our shifts never synced up.

22:18.487 --> 22:20.062
We barely even saw each other.

22:20.081 --> 22:23.990
But I had this
blocky old-school pager

22:24.068 --> 22:29.555
and he would send me
one, four, three.

22:30.183 --> 22:31.974
It's beeper code.

22:33.836 --> 22:36.078
It means I love you.

22:36.097 --> 22:40.173
Our anniversary
is tomorrow and...

22:40.193 --> 22:42.585
I think he's trying
to get my attention.

22:42.587 --> 22:44.987
What do you think
he wants to say to you?

22:46.757 --> 22:47.756
<i> No se.</i>

22:47.925 --> 22:52.111
I... Maybe just that,
that he loves me.

22:52.187 --> 22:53.762
Do you think there's more?

22:53.764 --> 22:54.997
I don't know.

22:57.435 --> 23:01.027
Okay, well, you said
that I needed to listen.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.713
And I'm trying.

23:04.032 --> 23:05.216
Can you help me?

23:05.292 --> 23:08.594
Maybe he is not the one
who needs to speak.

23:11.224 --> 23:14.875
Well, what do you suggest I do?

23:14.952 --> 23:16.685
Tomorrow is your anniversary.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.455
Treat like any other.

23:19.457 --> 23:22.066
Light some candles,
put on nice clothes,

23:22.217 --> 23:23.976
your best perfume,

23:24.128 --> 23:26.979
cook him his favorite meal.

23:27.131 --> 23:29.532
And then you tell him
how you feel.

23:31.577 --> 23:35.821
You want me to cook
my dead husband a porterhouse?

23:35.973 --> 23:38.398
Think of it as an offering.

23:38.418 --> 23:41.001
You can always eat
the leftovers later.

23:42.755 --> 23:45.405
OWEN: It's all in
the congressional record.
It's right there.

23:45.483 --> 23:47.741
A hundred and twenty
unidentified aerial phenomenon,

23:47.760 --> 23:50.428
all by Navy pilots, and that's
just in the last 20 years.

23:50.504 --> 23:52.004
-WYATT: No way.
-OWEN: Those are the ones

23:52.156 --> 23:53.264
the Pentagon cops to.

23:53.415 --> 23:55.266
Now they're always
near our nuclear facilities,

23:55.417 --> 23:56.934
always near our
weapons platform.

23:57.085 --> 23:58.010
Do you think
that's a coincidence?

23:58.162 --> 23:59.252
WYATT: Not anymore.

23:59.330 --> 24:01.439
Y'all are still
talkin' about aliens?

24:01.590 --> 24:03.515
Can you believe he's never
heard of ancient astronauts?

24:03.592 --> 24:04.942
Can you believe
Captain Strand thinks

24:05.019 --> 24:06.185
Martians built the pyramids?

24:06.261 --> 24:08.187
I-I never said that.
Mars is a dead planet.

24:08.339 --> 24:09.354
WYATT: Alright.
That's right, you did say that.

24:09.431 --> 24:10.764
Alright,
y'all are gonna have to

24:10.783 --> 24:12.024
tell me about that in a minute.

24:12.118 --> 24:15.435
I'm gonna go find me
a cactus to water over here.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.663
Of course, Mars wasn't
always dead planet.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.332
(sniffs)

24:23.537 --> 24:24.611
Oh...

24:24.630 --> 24:26.464
(flies buzzing)

24:36.717 --> 24:38.142
Hey, Cap!

24:38.293 --> 24:40.627
You might bring that
Geiger counter over here.

24:40.646 --> 24:41.628
Oh, I got it.

24:41.872 --> 24:44.231
No, no, no, Wyatt, no, no!
Stay there.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.611
-OWEN: I got it.
-JUDD: (sniffs) Oh!

24:51.716 --> 24:52.881
What's going on?

24:52.900 --> 24:54.975
(Geiger clicking)

24:54.994 --> 24:56.368
Take a look.

24:58.906 --> 25:02.166
JUDD:
You think this is the work
of your little green men?

25:03.394 --> 25:05.151
-No, I don't.
-(Geiger clicking loudly)

25:05.229 --> 25:06.578
We gotta back up!

25:06.731 --> 25:08.297
Come on.

25:09.233 --> 25:10.899
(dramatic music playing)

25:10.918 --> 25:12.259
(line ringing)

25:20.261 --> 25:22.578
Y'all sure neither one of you
touched any of the dead animals?

25:22.580 --> 25:24.763
No, I stayed back
by the observation post.

25:24.915 --> 25:26.023
The observation post?

25:26.100 --> 25:28.341
Yeah. It's that pile of clothes
back over there.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.269
And then me and Cap went in
and we investigated,

25:30.421 --> 25:32.363
but as soon as we saw that hog,
we hightailed it out of there.

25:32.514 --> 25:35.181
-Nobody got near it.
-Sure you're okay, Dad?

25:35.201 --> 25:36.367
Don't feel any stomach pain
or a headache?

25:36.518 --> 25:38.202
I'm a little caffeine-deprived,
but no, no.

25:38.279 --> 25:40.037
I'm feeling good.
Thanks, son.

25:40.114 --> 25:42.114
Alright. Well, nobody's
spiking a fever.

25:42.266 --> 25:44.283
I'm barely even getting
BG-level radiation off them.

25:44.435 --> 25:46.268
Does that mean
we're gonna be okay?

25:46.270 --> 25:48.212
It means it's safe to transfer
you to the hospital,

25:48.363 --> 25:49.880
and there
they'll take some tests

25:50.032 --> 25:51.048
just to be certain.

25:51.199 --> 25:52.274
Next time, try not to set up

25:52.276 --> 25:54.200
your weenie roast
near a hot zone.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.869
Well, that's the question,
isn't it?

25:55.946 --> 25:57.129
Where did that radiation
come from?

25:57.281 --> 25:59.873
Yeah, that's a mystery
for the DOD to figure out.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.284
Grace said they're sending
a containment team out soon.

26:02.286 --> 26:04.061
Alright. You might wanna leave
your blankets and such there

26:04.138 --> 26:05.229
for the cleanup crew

26:05.380 --> 26:07.231
and then we can all ride
to St. Joe's together.

26:07.341 --> 26:09.382
-Thank you, T.
-(cell phone ringing)

26:09.460 --> 26:11.551
Hey, Grace.
What's goin' on?

26:11.629 --> 26:13.553
You tell me.
Did Tommy check y'all out yet?

26:13.573 --> 26:15.314
JUDD (over phone):
<i> Yeah, everybody's doing okay.</i>

26:15.466 --> 26:16.965
Might have been
a different story if we wandered

26:16.984 --> 26:18.224
a little further
into the woods.

26:18.302 --> 26:19.243
OWEN (over phone):
<i> Gracie, this is Owen.</i>

26:19.394 --> 26:21.303
Any updates on
the DOD cleanup crew?

26:21.305 --> 26:22.896
No, and it doesn't seem like

26:22.915 --> 26:24.306
they're gonna get there
anytime soon.

26:24.475 --> 26:25.991
-What else do they have to do?
-GRACE:<i> I don't know.</i>

26:26.143 --> 26:27.476
All I could get out of 'em
is that they were dealing

26:27.569 --> 26:30.403
with a classified situation
down at Fort Sam Houston.

26:30.423 --> 26:32.831
<i> Listen, I just</i>
<i> checked our logs</i>

26:32.908 --> 26:34.074
<i> from the last three hours.</i>

26:34.093 --> 26:36.034
We've gotten three 9-1-1 calls

26:36.186 --> 26:37.094
from within a two-mile radius

26:37.245 --> 26:39.263
of where you're
standing right now.

26:40.157 --> 26:41.247
Well, what did they want?

26:41.325 --> 26:42.582
They were all hang-ups
from a TracFone,

26:42.602 --> 26:44.768
which is probably why
nobody paid much attention,

26:44.920 --> 26:47.329
but now I'm starting to think
somebody's in trouble.

26:47.348 --> 26:50.332
Do we know
where in the two-mile radius
it was coming from?

26:50.351 --> 26:51.183
Not really.

26:51.444 --> 26:53.335
It's all unincorporated land
out there.

26:53.337 --> 26:55.261
I do see three
residential addresses.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.764
I've tried calling all of 'em
and nobody's picking up.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.358
Alright, send us
the addresses.

26:59.434 --> 27:01.935
Captain Vega, gonna need
some of your suits.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.787
(Geiger clicking rapidly)

27:03.939 --> 27:05.772
My meter's goin' crazy.

27:05.791 --> 27:06.790
TOMMY: Mine too.

27:06.867 --> 27:08.851
I'm up to 200,000 microsieverts.

27:08.853 --> 27:12.338
Mine's already at 220.
Must be getting
close to the source.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.134
JUDD: Spooky.

27:17.211 --> 27:18.594
OWEN: This way.

27:21.081 --> 27:23.015
(Geiger clicking)

27:34.487 --> 27:35.486

27:36.489 --> 27:37.562
Got it.

27:37.639 --> 27:38.230

27:38.382 --> 27:40.366

27:49.702 --> 27:51.059

27:51.078 --> 27:52.670
It's okay. It's alright.

27:52.821 --> 27:54.338
We're here to help.

27:54.489 --> 27:56.990
I have a patient here
with acute radiation syndrome.

27:57.067 --> 27:58.842
Be prepared
for decon and transport.

27:58.994 --> 28:00.844
(Geiger clicking rapidly)

28:00.996 --> 28:02.680
I think I found the source.

28:02.756 --> 28:03.906
(clicking continues)

28:03.924 --> 28:05.307
NANCY: Oh, no.

28:06.260 --> 28:08.352
I think that's cesium chloride.

28:11.673 --> 28:15.083
They use it in
teletherapy machines
for cancer treatments.

28:15.085 --> 28:17.844
The radioactivity makes it glow.

28:17.922 --> 28:19.488
Close proximity to this...

28:20.348 --> 28:22.282
can kill you in a few days.

28:23.427 --> 28:25.369
How did it all end up here?

28:29.433 --> 28:32.284
Hey, ready to have
your mind blown?

28:32.436 --> 28:34.694
You know that old hospital
in Lockhart?

28:34.747 --> 28:38.290
-WREN: Yeah?
-Wren, feast your eyes
on this haul.

28:38.442 --> 28:40.300
-WREN: Oh.

28:41.962 --> 28:43.946

making found-object art,

28:43.964 --> 28:47.391
but is there ever a point
we have found enough objects?

28:47.468 --> 28:49.309
Jimmied this thing out of it.

28:51.105 --> 28:52.879
What is that?

28:52.898 --> 28:54.398
JASPER:
I know one way to find out.

slipped out of the hot zone.

31:18.936 --> 31:19.877

is a receipt with
a partial credit card number

if it hadn't been for him,

38:25.028 --> 38:26.594
you know, your whole, uh...

38:27.955 --> 38:29.213
whole trip would've been ruined.

38:29.290 --> 38:31.975
No. No, this was
the best weekend of my life

38:32.126 --> 38:33.685
because of you.

38:34.962 --> 38:36.563
What are you talkin' about?

38:38.299 --> 38:40.984
I've always wanted
to go camping with my dad.

38:41.728 --> 38:43.028
Now I have.

38:44.323 --> 38:46.881
I don't... I don't know
if we can rightly call

38:46.883 --> 38:47.882
what we did camping.

38:47.901 --> 38:49.717
Judd.

38:49.736 --> 38:53.038
You stayed outside
till the sun came up,
did you not?

38:53.665 --> 38:55.073
Yeah.

38:55.149 --> 38:57.542
Okay, sweetheart,
then you went camping.

38:59.338 --> 39:01.671
-Well, I'm...
-(Grace laughing)

39:01.823 --> 39:03.231
Well, next time, uh,

39:03.233 --> 39:04.749
next time we'll go to
my Uncle Cash's...

39:04.826 --> 39:08.553
Actually, it would actually be
your Great Uncle Cash's ranch.

39:09.831 --> 39:11.330
And they got sunsets there

39:11.408 --> 39:14.075
that are too pretty
for postcards.

39:14.094 --> 39:16.686
Yeah. Yeah,
that would be really cool.

39:16.763 --> 39:17.837
-Yeah?
-WYATT: Yeah.

39:17.914 --> 39:18.897
Alright.

39:20.025 --> 39:23.751
Well, um, I'm sure
he's tired of losing.

39:23.753 --> 39:25.753
Imma let you take a turn.

39:25.772 --> 39:26.921
I will check on the baby.

39:26.923 --> 39:28.106
Look at me.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.141
Do not go easy on him
because he's your father.

39:30.293 --> 39:31.851
Do you hear me?
(Grace laughs)

39:31.928 --> 39:33.036
Get out.

39:33.113 --> 39:35.246
I won't, Mrs. Ryder.

39:35.932 --> 39:37.248
Wyatt.

39:38.210 --> 39:39.667
Call me Grace, okay?

39:43.698 --> 39:44.672
Y'all have fun.

39:47.127 --> 39:49.594
So what's he like, Uncle Cash?

39:50.872 --> 39:53.281
Uh... Well, he's
a salty old cuss

39:53.283 --> 39:56.784
and most of the time
he's drunk as a skunk, so...

39:56.803 --> 39:58.019
I think you'll like him.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.379
Can't wait.

40:38.328 --> 40:40.687
I guess we're really
doing this, husband.

40:42.107 --> 40:45.349
Oh, it's not to your level.

40:45.426 --> 40:48.853
But I basted the hell
out of that steak.

40:48.930 --> 40:50.655
And I think
you're going to like it.

40:51.933 --> 40:54.676
I... I think you would...

40:54.694 --> 40:55.994
have liked it.

40:57.197 --> 40:59.956
And I don't know

41:00.107 --> 41:01.749
how this is supposed to go.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.546
Oh. Um...

41:09.301 --> 41:10.425
Charles...

41:11.377 --> 41:13.118
we miss you.

41:13.196 --> 41:15.305
A whole hell of a lot.

41:16.199 --> 41:18.016
And we're gonna be alright.

41:19.644 --> 41:20.727
We're good.

41:22.814 --> 41:26.557
And that's not entirely true.

41:26.710 --> 41:27.692
Um...

41:29.136 --> 41:32.280
I'm not always good.

41:34.901 --> 41:36.451
I lie awake at night...

41:37.570 --> 41:38.745
wondering...

41:40.390 --> 41:41.723
"Would things be different

41:41.741 --> 41:46.294
if I had just come home
just-just an hour earlier?"

41:49.733 --> 41:50.965
Did you suffer?

41:53.011 --> 41:55.261
Are you still suffering?

41:58.683 --> 42:00.016
It kills me.

42:02.095 --> 42:04.395
It still kills me.

42:07.341 --> 42:11.152
Charles, if you're here
with me right now,

42:11.938 --> 42:14.105
could you give me a sign?

42:14.181 --> 42:16.658
Could you make
the lights flicker?

42:19.095 --> 42:20.328
Please?
