00:34.568 --> 00:36.568
I know I'm not
the man of your dreams.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.437
Will you accept
my humble proposal?

00:38.439 --> 00:40.239
We're married,
we can't be unmarried.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.640
<i>I thought we'd agree</i>

00:41.642 --> 00:44.109
Henry, end this now.
Leave, penelope.

00:44.111 --> 00:46.345
Get out. Now!

00:46.347 --> 00:47.780
Henry, no!
While the king feels forgiving

00:47.782 --> 00:49.148
Francis:
<i>If word gets</i>

00:49.150 --> 00:50.182
<i>This country could come apart.</i>

00:50.184 --> 00:51.550
I was paid to murder the queen

00:51.552 --> 00:53.585
Of scots on her voyage home.

00:53.587 --> 00:56.088
We'll go when it's safe.
My mother's in jeopardy now.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.123
Scotland is in jeopardy now.

00:58.125 --> 01:01.260
Guards, surround the queen.
<i>Locked in the tower?</i>

01:01.262 --> 01:03.062
But I have done this for you.

01:03.064 --> 01:05.397
I love you,
and I've put you first.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.599
You can't just leave me
locked in here. Francis!

01:07.601 --> 01:10.269
Francis!

01:14.174 --> 01:15.741
(cries): No!

01:15.743 --> 01:17.342
Gabriel commanded
my best archer corps.

01:19.646 --> 01:21.580
Some of his men
were twice his age.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.449
But they all loved him.

01:23.451 --> 01:25.250
He sang to them at night.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.753
He sang of this place.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.456
His home.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.258
Your brother died fighting
for his home, his people.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.760
With great bravery.

01:39.232 --> 01:42.601
I understand
you lost a son today.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.637
But I lost a soldier, and only
one of those can be remedied.

01:45.639 --> 01:48.273
Gabriel's men followed him
because he was a nobleman.

01:48.275 --> 01:51.577
They will follow his brother

01:51.579 --> 01:52.744
For the same good reason.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.780
Please.
We don't need your money.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.783
Martin's only 14.
He's too young.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.751
A year older than I was
when I first saw combat.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.854
My lord duke,
I can't allow it.

02:01.856 --> 02:02.855
You can.

02:02.857 --> 02:05.390
And you will.

02:07.527 --> 02:09.628
Would you ask my men
to sacrifice themselves

02:09.630 --> 02:12.764
For the protection of estates
that won't sacrifice for them?

02:16.469 --> 02:18.504
Be proud of your sons.

02:18.506 --> 02:19.671
I am.

02:19.673 --> 02:22.141
Soldier:
Forward...!

02:22.143 --> 02:24.276

02:53.707 --> 02:54.940
I'm not
that far along yet.

02:56.242 --> 02:58.677
It wasn't so long ago

02:58.679 --> 03:00.546
We were all talking
about our first kisses?

03:00.548 --> 03:01.747
Now you're all married.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.415
And soon you will be as well.

03:03.417 --> 03:04.750
Unless I ruin it before then.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.818
Or my father does.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.487
He's arriving today,
and I'm worried

03:08.489 --> 03:10.589
He'll offend lord castleroy
with too small a dowry.

03:10.591 --> 03:11.790
We can't afford much.

03:11.792 --> 03:12.958
Have you told lord castleroy

03:12.960 --> 03:14.626
Your family's lost its fortune?

03:14.628 --> 03:15.928
He might be understanding.

03:15.930 --> 03:17.529
Tell a suitor we're broke?

03:17.531 --> 03:19.331
My father would have
a heart attack.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.466
(laughs)
I've had more opportunities

03:21.468 --> 03:23.435
Than you can count.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.970
And what do I do?

03:24.972 --> 03:26.271
Fall in love with a servant

03:26.273 --> 03:27.839
And nearly ruin his life, too.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.775
We've all had the same
opportunity, and look at us.

03:29.777 --> 03:30.909
I never dreamt

03:30.911 --> 03:32.277
That I'd be wed to a bastard

03:32.279 --> 03:33.812
With an imaginary title.

03:33.814 --> 03:34.947
Lola's been forced
to hide her pregnancy.

03:34.949 --> 03:37.282
Even mary and francis...

03:39.285 --> 03:41.620
Yes, when we couldn't come
to terms on my brother,

03:41.622 --> 03:44.590
My beloved husband
locked me in a tower.

03:45.725 --> 03:46.959
It's been almost a month.

03:46.961 --> 03:49.494
Are you and francis
on any better terms?

03:49.496 --> 03:51.330
Well, I can now talk to
him without screaming.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.965
Does that count as "better"?

03:52.967 --> 03:55.701
(door opens)

03:55.703 --> 03:58.737
Your majesty?
I have dire news from scotland.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.939
It's about your mother,
marie de guise.

04:02.442 --> 04:04.710
The protestants and their
lords of the congregation

04:04.712 --> 04:07.312
Have sent an army to besiege
my mother in edinburgh.

04:07.314 --> 04:10.549
There are men outside the castle
demanding her surrender.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.918
Her friends don't know how much
longer she can hold out for.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.720
Mary, I'm so sorry.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.555
My brother james warned us
that the protestants

04:16.557 --> 04:18.790
Were planning a rebellion
against my mother.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.726
If I had gone with him,
I could have stopped it.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.261
Or you could've been killed.

04:22.263 --> 04:23.795
This news only proves it.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.664
It's too bad we couldn't
protect my mother

04:25.666 --> 04:27.733
By locking her in the tower
as you did with me.

04:27.735 --> 04:28.734
Instead of arguing,

04:28.736 --> 04:29.901
Let's help her.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.837
Your mother needs soldiers
and quickly.

04:31.839 --> 04:32.938
And how are we supposed
to get them?

04:32.940 --> 04:34.273
Certainly not from your father.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.907
Armies can be bought.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.476
Who has that kind of money?

04:37.478 --> 04:38.810
My mother.

04:38.812 --> 04:39.945
Francis, I've already
asked your mother.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.346
More than once.

04:41.348 --> 04:42.948
She's always said no.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.683
Then we will ask her together.

04:44.685 --> 04:47.019
And we will keep asking
until she says yes.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.894
Mother, we need to talk.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.062
I realize that.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.064
Why do you think
I sent for you two?

04:59.066 --> 05:00.832
Oh, you sent for us?
So you've heard the news then?

05:00.834 --> 05:02.000
I'm sorry, mary.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.769
You must be crushed.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.871
Well, I'm worried,
I'm not crushed.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.539
There's still time to
send reinforcements.

05:07.541 --> 05:08.974
Oh, dear.

05:08.976 --> 05:12.411
I don't think we're talking
about the same news.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.880
Have you not heard
about the succession?

05:14.882 --> 05:16.081
Whose succession?

05:16.083 --> 05:17.683
Not yours, I'm afraid.

05:17.685 --> 05:18.884
Word came from England.

05:18.886 --> 05:20.419
It's official.

05:20.421 --> 05:23.889
Elizabeth will be
their next queen.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.824
Mary tudor's dead?
Henry: No!

05:25.826 --> 05:28.093
The old bitch is still clinging
to her miserable life.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.861
But she managed to
cough up the gall

05:29.863 --> 05:31.963
To hand over her crown
to elizabeth.

05:31.965 --> 05:35.100
A bastard, a protestant no less,
and not my son's wife!

05:35.102 --> 05:36.935
Are you even pregnant yet?

05:36.937 --> 05:39.404
Could you possibly be
any less use to France?

05:39.406 --> 05:40.872
Do not talk to my
wife that way.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.474
She's a queen and an ally.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.109
She was supposed
to get me England!

05:44.111 --> 05:46.111
We've been feeding

05:46.113 --> 05:48.980
And housing this ally

05:48.982 --> 05:50.449
For most of her pointless life.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.750
And what have we gotten?

05:51.752 --> 05:53.952
A drain on our treasure
and army,

05:53.954 --> 05:55.554
An endless parade

05:55.556 --> 05:57.823
Of dramas and headaches.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.725
Scotland protects France

05:59.727 --> 06:01.626
By engaging the english
on two fronts

06:01.628 --> 06:04.629
So it cannot focus its force
on growing its foothold

06:04.631 --> 06:05.931
On your backyard, calais.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.032
I don't need a lecture
from you

06:07.034 --> 06:08.467
On geography.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.835
Scotland cannot blunt

06:09.837 --> 06:12.037
The english threat alone,
your grace.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.373
Especially not now!
Yes, I've heard
all about it.

06:14.375 --> 06:15.540
Protestants threatening
your mother.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.008
She needs reinforcements

06:17.010 --> 06:18.910
Just like always.
No, not just like always.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.979
She is under siege.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.714
There are soldiers
at her gates!

06:22.716 --> 06:23.815
And now you're afraid

06:23.817 --> 06:25.384
Your poor mother might die?

06:25.386 --> 06:27.519
Well, don't we owe it
to scotland and France,

06:27.521 --> 06:31.156
As rulers, to ask if that
might be a good thing?

06:31.158 --> 06:33.959
Your mother can't handle
the job that you gave her.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.694
Or else she wouldn't be
under siege!

06:35.696 --> 06:38.530
Father, stop this.
Mary's crown is at stake,

06:38.532 --> 06:40.599
Which puts France
at risk as well.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.668
More than her crown is at stake.
Your mother

06:43.670 --> 06:46.505
Failed us completely.
And now they want

06:46.507 --> 06:48.006
Her head on a pike.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.975
Be careful.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.077
Or yours might follow.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.020
No one?

07:02.022 --> 07:05.056
Not one country
or lord offers help?

07:05.058 --> 07:07.659
My mother is a catholic ally.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.094
She is under attack.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.930
Enemies screaming for her head,
and no one cares?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.832
Scotland has many
friends at court.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.167
But every conversation I have

07:15.169 --> 07:17.502
With a noble or diplomat
ends the same way.

07:17.504 --> 07:20.071
"we're with you, dauphin,
but what does the king say?"

07:20.073 --> 07:21.940
I hope you didn't tell them.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.110
Mary, I should never
have let my father...

07:25.112 --> 07:27.846
Words don't bother me.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.681
You are safe in this castle.

07:29.683 --> 07:30.849
Not even my mother...

07:30.851 --> 07:32.517
Threats don't
bother me, either.

07:32.519 --> 07:34.052
Losing bothers me.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.520
Mary, that's silly, you're...

07:35.522 --> 07:37.856
A queen? Yes, I am.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.624
But one with scant power here.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.126
And less every day back home.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.629
On the other hand,

07:44.631 --> 07:45.964
I'm also queen

07:45.966 --> 07:47.566
Because I'm a de guise.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.734
I have very powerful uncles.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.169
I hope you're not thinking...

07:51.171 --> 07:53.171
My mother is surrounded
on all sides.

07:53.173 --> 07:57.042
Protestants are burning
and pillaging catholic churches.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.177
Why would they stop
their campaign of destruction

07:59.179 --> 08:01.213
Before making sure I lose
my mother and my crown?

08:01.215 --> 08:03.114
But the duke of guise?

08:03.116 --> 08:05.217
Ever since you've been back
at court, you've chosen

08:05.219 --> 08:06.485
To keep your distance from him.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.786
The same as my parents have.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.588
Your uncle is a dangerously

08:09.590 --> 08:11.089
Ambitious man, who has
built himself an army

08:11.091 --> 08:12.924
By stealing recruits
from their mothers.

08:12.926 --> 08:13.959
And paying them well.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.093
Do you know anyone else

08:15.095 --> 08:16.495
With an army
as large or as loyal?

08:16.497 --> 08:17.562
Loyal to him.

08:17.564 --> 08:19.130
And him only.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.832
Is that someone
that you can trust?

08:20.834 --> 08:22.767
He is my uncle.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.769
If that doesn't buy me
his loyalty...

08:24.771 --> 08:26.137
Well...

08:26.139 --> 08:29.241
Trust is a luxury
I can no longer afford.

08:34.247 --> 08:37.749
Sorry, you're not to be let in
under any circumstances.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.050
Do you know who I am?

08:39.052 --> 08:40.051
You're
the contest winner

08:40.053 --> 08:41.286
The king enjoyed.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.188
And then cast aside.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.757
Penelope,
what are you doing here?

08:45.759 --> 08:47.659
Surely a bounty
of demeaning tasks

08:47.661 --> 08:48.827
Awaits you in the kitchen.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.096
I need to see
the king immediately.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.964
I'm pregnant.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.065
With his child.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.001
You're not pregnant.

08:56.003 --> 08:58.236
Even if you are, it's not
with the king's child.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.938
Well, the king
will want to know.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.874
He's going to wonder if he's got

09:02.876 --> 09:04.876
Another chance at happiness.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.177
Another chance at a child

09:06.179 --> 09:07.212
He could truly love!
Shut her up now.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.915
Henry, I love you
and I miss you!

09:09.917 --> 09:11.149
And I'm carrying your child!

09:14.086 --> 09:16.087
You're pregnant?

09:16.089 --> 09:17.856
You're certain it's my child?

09:17.858 --> 09:20.058
There's been no one else,
your majesty.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.192
I was a maiden when you took me.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.327
Catherine:
Oh, that's nonsense.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.862
See that she's taken care of.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.196
Set her up with a cottage

09:25.198 --> 09:26.331
In one of the villages.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.700
Oh!

09:28.702 --> 09:30.201
I have some mistresses.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.203
In bernay, I think.

09:32.205 --> 09:35.340
The child could have siblings
to play with, huh?

09:35.342 --> 09:37.108
Wait.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.877
That's all I get?

09:38.879 --> 09:40.178
Henry!

09:40.180 --> 09:42.881
It's more than you deserve.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.083
Are you sure you want
to be playing this game?

09:45.085 --> 09:46.251
If you overplay it,

09:46.253 --> 09:48.119
If he loses patience
with your displays,

09:48.121 --> 09:50.055
You won't like how it ends.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.122
The two dead girls

09:51.124 --> 09:52.791
Before you didn't.

09:52.793 --> 09:53.892
Nothing bothers me
more than problems

09:53.894 --> 09:55.894
I've already solved coming back

09:55.896 --> 09:57.629
To be problems again.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.931
If that's what you make
of yourself, my child,

09:59.933 --> 10:02.901
Expect me to make you a
lesson to my other problems

10:02.903 --> 10:04.903
By grinding you into the dust

10:04.905 --> 10:07.205
You no longer see fit to sweep.

10:21.988 --> 10:25.223
Oh-oh-oh! Oh, I've missed you
two so much!

10:28.160 --> 10:30.095
Father.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.262
Where's mother?

10:31.264 --> 10:33.298
She's at home
with your other sisters.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.133
I've only brought these two
so you could introduce them

10:35.135 --> 10:36.801
To potential suitors.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.137
Aren't they a little young
to be looking for husbands?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.305
Considering all the trouble
we've had with you,

10:40.307 --> 10:42.273
I regret not bringing
them sooner.

10:42.275 --> 10:45.243
And I hope you
haven't made too large
a mess for me to clean up.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.778
I realize
I made a mistake,

10:46.780 --> 10:48.780
But it's not as bad
as you may have heard.

10:48.782 --> 10:52.651
Any surprises for lord castleroy
on your wedding night?

10:52.653 --> 10:54.686
Anything he can accuse you
of later?

10:54.688 --> 10:57.122
No, it didn't go that far.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.890
Does that
embarrass you?

10:58.892 --> 11:00.692
Then imagine how it embarrassed
the family.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.961
I may sound harsh,
but it's for your own good.

11:02.963 --> 11:05.030
You can't afford
to lose another suitor.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.231
Do I have it wrong?

11:06.233 --> 11:09.034
No, father.

11:10.369 --> 11:11.870
(door creaks)

11:11.872 --> 11:14.205
I stopped by our new house
on the way back.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.408
It needs work
before we can live there.

11:16.410 --> 11:18.943
Especially if we want
to bring it to your standards.

11:18.945 --> 11:20.879
Oh, bash, that's lovely,

11:20.881 --> 11:23.281
But what happened
out there? You've been out

11:23.283 --> 11:25.984
Hunting that creature.
Have you found it yet?

11:25.986 --> 11:27.452
The darkness?

11:27.454 --> 11:30.255
No sign of it yet,
but it's only a matter of time.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.257
The blood wood is vast,
but not limitless.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.359
Have you been all right?

11:34.361 --> 11:37.095
I hope there haven't been any
more encounters with the king.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.197
I've been staying out
of his way.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.132
Waiting for you to return.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.173
(both moan)

11:48.175 --> 11:50.341
Why do you stop?

11:50.343 --> 11:52.310
It's not our first kiss.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.145
You're my husband,
it's all right.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.081
It's not as though
I'm inexperienced.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.449
I'm well aware of that.

11:57.451 --> 11:59.818
Well, if you
wanted a virgin...

11:59.820 --> 12:02.320
No, I don't. But I care
about your experience.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.289
I know not all of it
has been good.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.157
There's no changing
that now.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.926
I disagree.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.228
♪ and gone in the blink
of my eye, gone, gone ♪

12:10.230 --> 12:12.230
♪ gone, in the blink of my eye

12:12.232 --> 12:13.832
What are you doing?

12:13.834 --> 12:17.769
Helping you forget
everything and everyone

12:17.771 --> 12:19.771
That's come before this.

12:19.773 --> 12:23.007
Tell me what you want...

12:23.009 --> 12:25.343
Very specifically.
Leave nothing out.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.778
All right.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.279
♪ gone, gone, gone

12:28.281 --> 12:31.416
♪ in the blink of my,
blink of my eye ♪

12:38.190 --> 12:40.091
(moans)

12:41.527 --> 12:45.330
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

12:45.332 --> 12:48.433
Francis, you should have
talked her out of this madness.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.901
You should have helped her.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.035
(horses neighing)

12:51.037 --> 12:53.271
I know you're
a student of history.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.106
Perhaps you missed this chapter:

12:55.108 --> 12:57.408
The duke was dismissed
from your father's court

12:57.410 --> 12:58.443
For grasping at too
much power.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.779
And you know what
he did then?

13:00.781 --> 13:03.348
He fielded that army
to grasp at more.

13:03.350 --> 13:07.886
He's a vicious
self-serving killer,
a threat to any throne.

13:07.888 --> 13:11.489
Coming from you, that's
a ringing endorsement.

13:11.491 --> 13:14.359
I wouldn't be so smug, my dear.

13:16.362 --> 13:19.531
You just let the devil
into our home.

13:27.072 --> 13:29.841
Thank you so much
for coming, uncle.

13:29.843 --> 13:32.310
We wish it was under
better circumstances.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.912
Like your wedding, perhaps?

13:33.914 --> 13:35.413
I seem to have missed
my invitation

13:35.415 --> 13:38.316
To that happy event,
your grace.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.350
The wedding
was very rushed.

13:39.352 --> 13:41.019
I hope you took
no offense.

13:41.021 --> 13:44.322
Nonsense.
Don't trouble yourself
over niceties. I don't.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.257
Dauphin.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.092
The king and queen send
their regards.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.461
They regret not greeting
you personally,

13:50.463 --> 13:52.363
But urgent matters
demand their attention.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.199
You don't have to make excuses.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.267
I'm aware of your parents'
opinion of me.

13:56.269 --> 13:59.571
And from what I hear, even when
your father is present,

13:59.573 --> 14:02.340
The king is no longer
in the castle.

14:02.342 --> 14:06.077
I don't know what rumors
you've heard, sir, but...

14:06.079 --> 14:08.146
Call me christian,
and let's spare ourselves

14:08.148 --> 14:10.114
Lots of pointless
formality and posturing.

14:10.116 --> 14:13.184
I have friends who tell me
what goes on in this castle.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.853
I know why you asked for me,

14:14.855 --> 14:17.322
And I'm here to get you out
of the hole

14:17.324 --> 14:18.456
My sister's incompetence
put you in.

14:18.458 --> 14:22.460
Very well, no posturing.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.462
My mother is in danger,
but I'm guessing

14:24.464 --> 14:27.498
That it will take more
than family loyalty
to buy your help.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.267
So what will it be?

14:29.269 --> 14:30.935
Money? Land?

14:30.937 --> 14:32.370
Neither.

14:32.372 --> 14:36.274
Your father dismissed me
from court years ago.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.109
I want a position
in court again.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.544
A more permanent one.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.379
Lord magistrate of France
will do.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.449
The lord magistrate is the
king's right hand. You want a

14:44.451 --> 14:46.451
Better position than the one
that you were stripped of

14:46.453 --> 14:48.119
After you challenged your king?

14:48.121 --> 14:50.355
I didn't challenge my king,
I served him.

14:50.357 --> 14:51.422
By appointing generals

14:51.424 --> 14:53.057
Without his permission
and doling out

14:53.059 --> 14:54.325
Political patronage
to your friends?

14:54.327 --> 14:58.997
Producing heirs, bastards and
otherwise, he needed my help,

14:58.999 --> 15:00.899
Whether he cared
to admit it or not.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.600
He needed your loyalty,

15:02.602 --> 15:04.936
Whether you cared
to provide it or not.

15:04.938 --> 15:08.239
I can make your army serve me
for nothing if I wanted.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.574
I have that authority.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.210
They're right outside
if you'd like to try.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.978
I just don't know how many

15:13.980 --> 15:16.080
Will still be around tomorrow
if I'm not.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.683
They're loyal to the man
who pays them, not the boy

15:18.685 --> 15:20.451
Who waves crowns at them.

15:20.453 --> 15:23.688
We'll consider the terms
and present them to henry.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.390
Uncle.

15:30.229 --> 15:31.429
Your father will
never agree.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.564
He has to.

15:33.566 --> 15:38.169
Or you'll lose scotland,
and so will we.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.637
(penelope moaning)

15:41.473 --> 15:44.175
Hurry up! I mean,
I want you and everything,

15:44.177 --> 15:45.510
But we must be quick.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.312
(chickens cackling)

15:50.482 --> 15:51.582
What's the meaning of this?

15:51.584 --> 15:55.186
Sorry, your majesty,
I was just...

15:55.188 --> 15:57.488
I know what you were just,
you vile little man.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.191
Have you no decency?

16:00.193 --> 16:02.360
Laying your hands
on a favorite of your king?

16:02.362 --> 16:05.530
Leave, before I have you
thrown in the dungeon!

16:08.067 --> 16:09.701
(door opens, closes)

16:11.203 --> 16:12.637
I hope he didn't hurt you.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.740
No.
I got here just
in time, didn't I?

16:15.742 --> 16:18.009
If that man had had his way,

16:18.011 --> 16:20.411
He'd be able to claim
your unborn child,

16:20.413 --> 16:22.513
And where would that leave you
with the king?

16:22.515 --> 16:23.581
I'm already pregnant.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.550
My child is the king's.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.418
Then I'm sure
you'll agree it's
not just yourself

16:27.420 --> 16:29.020
That you need
to protect anymore.

16:29.022 --> 16:32.123
The life of the king's
unborn baby is at stake.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.691
We simply can't
risk that.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.594
You need to go somewhere safe.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.200
The king will be outraged
when he finds out

16:42.202 --> 16:45.069
You're locking me
and his baby in here.

16:45.071 --> 16:48.039
No, the king will be outraged
when "his" baby comes out

16:48.041 --> 16:49.574
Looking more like one
of his stable boys.

16:49.576 --> 16:52.777
Or, more likely,
no baby comes out at all.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.413
Neither of those things
will happen.

16:55.415 --> 16:58.583
Enjoy your solitude, my dear.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.052
I'll drop by
every month or so

17:01.054 --> 17:03.688
To share in the joy of watching
your belly grow.

17:06.291 --> 17:08.092
Wait!
Don't leave me here!

17:09.628 --> 17:12.530
A word of advice from someone
who knows:

17:12.532 --> 17:14.665
Don't make friends
with the rats. They bite.

17:17.669 --> 17:19.437
Wait, wait.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.609
Greer tells me her sisters have
never been to a castle before.

17:24.611 --> 17:27.412
I say we give them
the royal tour.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.180
That can wait.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.715
I'd like to discuss
the matter

17:30.717 --> 17:32.417
Of greer's dowry
as soon as possible.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.552
Now? In front of your daughters?

17:34.554 --> 17:36.320
We don't need to discuss
greer's dowry.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.556
I've given the matter some
thought, and I'm not interested.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.258
Not interested?

17:41.593 --> 17:43.194
Then what is it you want?

17:43.196 --> 17:45.129
Only your blessing for her hand.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.501
You have it, my lord.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.637
I can't tell you
how happy that makes me.

18:05.717 --> 18:08.186
(clears throat) I need to speak
with you, father. It's urgent.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.655
Nothing is more urgent than war.
I agree.

18:10.657 --> 18:13.658
A solution for scotland
all this time

18:13.660 --> 18:15.593
We've been waiting for mary
tudor to give us England.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.529
To allow us the privilege of
putting your wife on the throne.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.431
But the english don't wait.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.101
They take
what they want,

18:23.103 --> 18:24.702
Just like they took
calais from us.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.704
So I'm going
to take it back.

18:26.706 --> 18:29.607
After that, I'll take
all of England.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.476
We'll attack from
scotland in the north

18:31.478 --> 18:33.111
And calais in the south.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.680
When they wake up tomorrow
to see french soldiers

18:35.682 --> 18:39.183
Massing around calais,
we might even get lucky.

18:39.185 --> 18:41.185
They might surrender
to spare themselves
certain defeat.

18:41.187 --> 18:43.488
Tomorrow? How could you...?

18:43.490 --> 18:46.290
I can't wait to see the look
on mary tudor's face

18:46.292 --> 18:47.758
When I claim the english throne
for myself.

18:47.760 --> 18:51.629
I just hope that sick cow
lives long enough

18:51.631 --> 18:54.198
For me to execute her.
Father, tomorrow?

18:54.200 --> 18:55.666
What have you done?

18:55.668 --> 18:56.767
Can't you read?!

18:56.769 --> 18:58.669
General brantome's
men are moving

18:58.671 --> 19:00.404
Northeast from rouen
as we speak.

19:00.406 --> 19:01.672
<i>General</i> brantome?

19:01.674 --> 19:03.875
I had to relieve laval.
No imagination.

19:03.877 --> 19:05.576
No courage.

19:05.578 --> 19:08.913
Stop babbling, father,
and tell me the truth.

19:08.915 --> 19:11.315
Did you do this?
Why wouldn't I?

19:11.317 --> 19:14.485
We don't have the strength
to take calais.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.588
Our armies are spread
too thin, all over europe!

19:17.590 --> 19:20.291
If we lose,
and they capture
our forces,

19:20.293 --> 19:21.759
They can stage an invasion

19:21.761 --> 19:24.795
And sweep down through France
unopposed!

19:24.797 --> 19:26.898
But francis, we can't lose!

19:26.900 --> 19:28.332
Yes, we can,

19:28.334 --> 19:29.734
And we will!

19:29.736 --> 19:32.503
Father, thousands will die.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.305
You don't understand.

19:36.308 --> 19:39.610
"blessed be the lord,
my strength,

19:39.612 --> 19:41.445
"which teacheth my hands to war,

19:41.447 --> 19:44.582
And my fingers to fight."

19:44.584 --> 19:46.417
I prayed for his guidance,

19:46.419 --> 19:50.454
And he spoke to me
in a glorious waking dream.

19:50.456 --> 19:52.456
He said that I would claim
victory at calais!

19:52.458 --> 19:55.293
Son, be happy with me!

19:55.295 --> 19:57.795
Thanks to your father,

19:57.797 --> 20:00.798
You are going to rule
half of europe!

20:04.303 --> 20:06.370
(sighs)

20:07.506 --> 20:09.240
(exhales)

20:14.813 --> 20:17.515
Francis?

20:17.517 --> 20:18.950
What's the matter? You look
like you've seen a ghost.

20:18.952 --> 20:20.685
I have.

20:20.687 --> 20:21.919
It's father;
he's gone utterly mad.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.722
Define "utterly,"
because this is a man

20:24.724 --> 20:26.824
Who's ridden a pig
through the throne room

20:26.826 --> 20:28.292
In nothing but his under things.

20:28.294 --> 20:29.794
Mother, he is
starting a war.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.662
What?
He's attacking calais.

20:31.664 --> 20:32.863
(chuckles)
oh, francis.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.899
Your father,
is that what he told you?

20:34.901 --> 20:37.468
It's all over his maps.
Darling, relax.

20:37.470 --> 20:40.004
I've taken general laval
into my confidence.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.473
He knows to do nothing
without my approval.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.408
General laval
has been dismissed.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.711
Brantome's in charge now.

20:46.713 --> 20:47.812
Who's brantome?

20:47.814 --> 20:50.915
Oh, yes, I forgot.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.883
He's the new one
henry brought it

20:52.885 --> 20:56.387
To replace laval when he refused
to rename the fifth army

20:56.389 --> 20:59.423
"god's gauls."

20:59.425 --> 21:01.492
Don't worry,
brantome's with us.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.963
All of these
dismissed generals.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.766
I'm beginning to guess
how mary's uncle knows so much.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.768
What will you do
when father realizes

21:10.770 --> 21:12.270
Your contravening
all his orders?

21:12.272 --> 21:13.804
Tomorrow he'll be invading
the spanish.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.673
The next day the dutch.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.275
When he starts remembering
who he invaded yesterday,

21:17.277 --> 21:20.478
Perhaps his wits
will have returned,

21:20.480 --> 21:21.879
And this whole nightmare
will be over.

21:21.881 --> 21:24.615
Darling, relax.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.784
If I left things to chance,

21:26.786 --> 21:29.587
We'd still be bowing
to queen penelope.

21:29.589 --> 21:30.988
I promise,

21:30.990 --> 21:32.790
It's under control.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.693
For France's sake,
I hope you're right.

21:35.695 --> 21:36.994
(panting)

21:38.297 --> 21:39.930
No. Not yet.

21:39.932 --> 21:41.332
(gasps)

21:41.334 --> 21:42.533
(laughter)

21:44.803 --> 21:47.471
You know, we can stop all this.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.906
It worked.
I've forgotten

21:48.908 --> 21:50.975
All about...

21:50.977 --> 21:52.810
You see, I can't even remember
what his name is anymore.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.979
(chuckles)
good.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.615
There's still more that
I want you to forget.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.884
Oh, in that case,
I'll forget that you told me

21:59.886 --> 22:02.653
Not to take off my skirt.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.055
That's not what I mean.

22:04.057 --> 22:06.724
I want you to forget...

22:06.726 --> 22:09.927
Every boy who ever
smiled at you.

22:10.862 --> 22:12.463
Every man

22:12.465 --> 22:13.898
Who ever flirted with you.

22:13.900 --> 22:16.334
Everyone but me.

22:18.537 --> 22:20.705
Christian:
Were the guards necessary?

22:20.707 --> 22:22.640
Surely a messenger
would have sufficed.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.875
I wanted to speak to you alone,
away from your men.

22:24.877 --> 22:26.977
But not away from your men,
I see.

22:26.979 --> 22:29.780
Have you spoken
with your father?

22:29.782 --> 22:31.916
The king will not agree
to the position you want.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.384
You never asked him, did you?

22:33.386 --> 22:34.952
We both know
it was a fool's errand.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.854
There is something else
that you want from me.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.823
Are you going
to tell me,

22:38.825 --> 22:41.025
Or am I meant to guess?

22:43.395 --> 22:44.995
Wise men

22:44.997 --> 22:46.130
Look to the future.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.898
They're patient.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.967
When I started to build
my army a decade ago,

22:49.969 --> 22:52.069
Other men saw a
ragtag rabble.

22:52.071 --> 22:53.971
I saw what it would become:

22:53.973 --> 22:56.407
A bargaining chip

22:56.409 --> 22:57.875
That would one day
bring kings to me,

22:57.877 --> 22:59.877
Begging for favors.

22:59.879 --> 23:04.115
You never expected to be
father's lord magistrate.

23:04.117 --> 23:07.585
You want to be mine,
when I'm king,

23:07.587 --> 23:09.987
Even if you have
to be patient.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.556
I won't have to be patient
for long, I don't think.

23:12.558 --> 23:15.760
Is it poison, I wonder,
that is driving him mad?

23:18.497 --> 23:20.498
I don't trust you

23:20.500 --> 23:21.899
And I don't like you.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.834
Well, being liked
is a king's job,

23:23.836 --> 23:25.403
Not his lieutenant's.

23:27.439 --> 23:29.707
Everything in me
says I should say no.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.909
And yet you
are here...

23:31.911 --> 23:33.978
Away from
your wife.

23:33.980 --> 23:37.047
I think you knew you
might have to say yes,

23:37.049 --> 23:39.417
And she
would object.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.085
She would pay any
price to save scotland,

23:41.087 --> 23:42.553
But would never
ask you to.

23:42.555 --> 23:45.423
She knows how your family
feels about me.

23:45.425 --> 23:47.925
Well, you've just
explained to me why I love her.

23:47.927 --> 23:51.061
Enough to have her locked
in a tower, I've heard.

23:51.063 --> 23:53.531
Do you want this position
or don't you?

23:53.533 --> 23:55.933
I want the chance to
serve a great ruler.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.536
Great rulers aren't
afraid of the truth,

23:58.538 --> 24:00.604
No matter
how painful.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.973
The truth is,
you love your wife.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.942
The truth is,

24:04.944 --> 24:08.879
She needs me.

24:08.881 --> 24:11.048
So what will
it be...

24:12.083 --> 24:14.518
...My prince?

24:14.520 --> 24:16.487
When I am king,

24:16.489 --> 24:17.788
The position is yours.

24:20.692 --> 24:22.793
But I have one condition.

24:22.795 --> 24:23.994
Your men will report to me

24:23.996 --> 24:25.629
As they would to you.

24:25.631 --> 24:26.797
But why would you
need my men to...

24:26.799 --> 24:28.666
I'm going with
you to scotland.

24:28.668 --> 24:29.967
Well, that's
unwise.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.168
And if you die,

24:31.170 --> 24:33.003
Your promise to me
is worth nothing.

24:33.005 --> 24:36.974
Well, then, I suggest
you keep me alive.

24:40.912 --> 24:43.113
Mary:
Are you serious?

24:43.115 --> 24:45.049
My uncle agreed?

24:45.051 --> 24:46.517
He'll send enough men
to scotland

24:46.519 --> 24:48.052
To quell the rebellion
and save my mother?

24:48.054 --> 24:49.487
Yes.

24:49.489 --> 24:50.821
I'd almost
lost all hope.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.157
Francis, how did you manage it?

24:53.159 --> 24:54.558
I convinced the duke

24:54.560 --> 24:56.694
That it was
in his best interests.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.529
I'll explain when I'm back.

24:58.531 --> 24:59.763
Back?

24:59.765 --> 25:01.098
Back from where?

25:02.067 --> 25:04.034
I am going with him to scotland.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.569
What?

25:05.571 --> 25:06.804
Francis, no.

25:06.806 --> 25:08.806
Mary, I have to.

25:08.808 --> 25:10.808
It's the only way that I can
assure your mother's safety.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.243
And what of your safety?

25:12.245 --> 25:14.745
Well, the duke gets nothing
if I don't survive.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.146
With a man like that,

25:16.148 --> 25:18.082
I can't imagine
a better guarantee.

25:18.084 --> 25:21.118
Francis, I-I don't
know what to say.

25:21.120 --> 25:24.121
You're saving my country,
my mother,

25:24.123 --> 25:25.589
And you're risking your life
into the bargain.

25:25.591 --> 25:28.826
You needn't say anything.

25:28.828 --> 25:31.161
I've only kept
my promise.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.731
As a king and a husband.

25:35.133 --> 25:37.601
You've done
so much more than that.

26:07.632 --> 26:09.800
♪ gave you a minute

26:09.802 --> 26:12.937
♪ when you needed an hour

26:12.939 --> 26:15.639
♪ just to push it aside

26:15.641 --> 26:19.209

26:21.880 --> 26:23.113

26:23.115 --> 26:25.349
(gasps)

26:25.351 --> 26:27.084
I'm not complaining,
but...

26:27.086 --> 26:28.786
I thought you wanted
to take things slowly.

26:28.788 --> 26:29.987
Not anymore.

26:29.989 --> 26:31.655
Oh!

26:31.657 --> 26:33.991
♪ burning all the bridges

26:33.993 --> 26:35.926
Mmm...

26:37.897 --> 26:41.031
♪ but it was all in your head.

26:47.272 --> 26:48.839
Catherine:
<i>I'm here now.</i>
<i>Out with it.</i>

26:50.375 --> 26:51.942
There was never a baby.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.911
That took less time
than I thought.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.779
Please can I keep
working here

26:55.781 --> 26:57.181
In the castle?

26:57.183 --> 26:58.382
I'll empty chamber pots,

26:58.384 --> 26:59.817
I'll muck stalls,
anything.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.118
Oh, stop groveling.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.687
As much as it warms me
to hear it.

27:03.689 --> 27:05.756
I may have other uses for you.

27:05.758 --> 27:08.025
Other uses?
I have ladies--

27:08.027 --> 27:09.326
Technically, they're my friends,

27:09.328 --> 27:11.295
None of whom I trust.

27:11.297 --> 27:14.264
Because they're women
who sleep with men for a cause.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.200
Much like you did with the king.

27:16.202 --> 27:18.669
Only it would be
my cause.

27:18.671 --> 27:22.206
I promise you'll enjoy it
more than emptying chamber pots.

27:22.208 --> 27:25.342
I'm gonna send you
to a lady I know in Italy.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.077
You'll be taught

27:27.079 --> 27:28.779
Proper manners,
and the art

27:28.781 --> 27:29.913
Of deception.

27:29.915 --> 27:31.248
And if you work hard,

27:31.250 --> 27:33.884
You may be welcomed
back in the castle

27:33.886 --> 27:36.253
As a member of my flying squad.

27:36.255 --> 27:37.721
This is where

27:37.723 --> 27:39.156
You thank me.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.191
Thank you, your majesty.

27:41.193 --> 27:42.326
Uh...

27:46.197 --> 27:48.332
That will need fixing, too.

27:50.235 --> 27:53.203
My family has owned successful
mines for generations,

27:53.205 --> 27:55.372
And I'd always hoped
to pass that expertise on

27:55.374 --> 27:57.408
To my son, but unfortunately,

27:57.410 --> 28:00.244
I've had only daughters.
(chuckles)

28:00.246 --> 28:03.147
Take the
dumfries mine--

28:03.149 --> 28:05.883
It's returned 20 tons
of copper a week for years.

28:05.885 --> 28:08.218
A perfect investment
for a man such as yourself.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.787
Greer:
Lord castleroy
does quite well

28:09.789 --> 28:12.289
In the spice industry, father.
Why would he want

28:12.291 --> 28:14.792
To invest in mines
all the way over in scotland?
(robert chuckles)

28:14.794 --> 28:16.193
You can't want me to waste
lord castleroy's time

28:16.195 --> 28:18.195
Explaining things that are
beyond your intelligence.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.230
Do I have it wrong?

28:20.232 --> 28:22.166
I think you do, sir.

28:22.168 --> 28:24.134
Quite wrong.
I think you forget

28:24.136 --> 28:26.837
You're no longer simply
addressing your daughter,

28:26.839 --> 28:28.872
But <i>my</i> future wife.

28:28.874 --> 28:32.710
And I'm sorry to say that's
not your first mistake.

28:32.712 --> 28:35.145
I've done research
on your mines,

28:35.147 --> 28:37.347
And... Dumfries...

28:37.349 --> 28:39.717
Has been played
out for years.

28:39.719 --> 28:42.019
Much like the rest
of your holdings.

28:42.021 --> 28:45.222
Now, let's look at
some different figures.

28:46.825 --> 28:48.459
As part of our
marriage settlement,

28:48.461 --> 28:50.494
I will provide
10,000 francs

28:50.496 --> 28:53.897
To each of greer's sisters to be
used as their future dowries.

28:53.899 --> 28:55.232
This will allow
your daughters

28:55.234 --> 28:58.268
To marry men of
title and fortune,

28:58.270 --> 29:01.739
Making you and your
family wealthy.

29:01.741 --> 29:05.109
That <i>is</i> what you
want... Isn't it?

29:05.111 --> 29:06.376
Uh...

29:06.378 --> 29:08.145
There is just
one condition.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.980
Greer will have
final approval

29:09.982 --> 29:11.915
Over her sisters'
marriages,

29:11.917 --> 29:14.351
So she can see to it
that they marry men they love,

29:14.353 --> 29:17.054
Not those
forced on them.

29:18.356 --> 29:19.890
(robert stammers softly)

29:22.260 --> 29:24.828
Uh, why are you doing this?

29:24.830 --> 29:28.265
A good businessman always knows
what something is worth.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.367
And to me...

29:31.770 --> 29:34.004
...Greer is priceless.

29:39.043 --> 29:42.846
I never meant for you
to go to war for me.

29:42.848 --> 29:45.883
When are you going to
realize that I love you,

29:45.885 --> 29:48.051
And I'll do
anything for you?

29:49.487 --> 29:52.189
Darling, let me be grateful
for what you've done

29:52.191 --> 29:54.458
Without making promises
you can't keep.

29:54.460 --> 29:57.995
What you did was extraordinary.

29:57.997 --> 30:01.832
I think maybe when I return,

30:01.834 --> 30:04.468
You won't be the only
one waiting for me.

30:04.470 --> 30:07.337
You're suddenly
very sure of yourself.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.306
I am.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.975
But just to be safe.

30:27.425 --> 30:29.493
(passionate moaning)

30:29.495 --> 30:31.862
(exhales)

30:31.864 --> 30:35.365
Look at me.

30:35.367 --> 30:37.901
Am I the only one in this bed
with something to forget?

30:37.903 --> 30:39.303
What do you mean?

30:41.206 --> 30:43.407
When you're with me,

30:43.409 --> 30:46.510
I want to be the only one
inside your head.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.912
I want you to look

30:48.914 --> 30:51.415
Into my eyes and see only me.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.485
I want you to always

30:55.487 --> 30:57.354
Remember what I feel like.

30:57.356 --> 31:01.458
So when you're using your
fingers for some other task,

31:01.460 --> 31:03.527
You wish they were
touching me instead.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.629
I will.

31:05.631 --> 31:07.865
I want you to always remember

31:07.867 --> 31:10.434
What it feels like
to be with your wife.

31:10.436 --> 31:12.903
♪

31:31.456 --> 31:35.359
Ah, my wife and my son.

31:35.361 --> 31:37.995
Closest family
I have in this world.

31:37.997 --> 31:40.530
Sharing my castle,
my blood, my legacy.

31:40.532 --> 31:42.566
Why would you lie to me?

31:42.568 --> 31:44.201
What do you mean?

31:44.203 --> 31:45.903
Don't bother adding
more lies to the pile.

31:45.905 --> 31:47.337
I know what you've done.

31:47.339 --> 31:49.072
You've kept me
caged up in this place

31:49.074 --> 31:50.540
Like one of your song birds.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.509
Sending in generals

31:52.511 --> 31:54.244
To humor me.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.479
Don't blame mother
when you've been

31:55.481 --> 31:58.081
Hatching plans
to attack half of europe.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.350
They aren't plans anymore!

32:00.352 --> 32:02.552
French forces marched
for calais this morning.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.454
They're already halfway there.

32:04.456 --> 32:05.989
You think I'm delusional?

32:05.991 --> 32:07.424
Read these dispatches.

32:07.426 --> 32:10.560
They aren't from any of your

32:10.562 --> 32:12.329
Performing generals.

32:12.331 --> 32:14.097
What happened to
general brantome?

32:14.099 --> 32:15.299
I've sacked them all.

32:15.301 --> 32:17.467
We don't need any generals.
You...

32:17.469 --> 32:18.602
Not when we have
a king to lead our men.

32:18.604 --> 32:19.603
I leave tonight

32:19.605 --> 32:22.072
To join the invasion.

32:26.077 --> 32:30.013
Oh, dear.

32:30.015 --> 32:32.582
No trousers.

32:32.584 --> 32:35.519
This keeps happening.

32:35.521 --> 32:38.622
I realize now that you two

32:38.624 --> 32:40.624
Were only trying to protect me.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.492
Guarding my legacy.

32:42.494 --> 32:45.362
But that's my job, not yours.

32:45.364 --> 32:48.031
I will not be remembered
as king henry,

32:48.033 --> 32:51.201
Ruler who dreamed of conquest.

32:51.203 --> 32:53.737
I'll be remembered
as king henry, conqueror.

32:53.739 --> 32:56.273
Greatest military strategist

32:56.275 --> 32:57.641
Since hannibal.

32:57.643 --> 33:00.577
Henry, darling,
you're not well.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.112
I have headaches.

33:02.114 --> 33:03.146
You know what else I have?

33:03.148 --> 33:04.381
The backing

33:04.383 --> 33:05.716
Of god.

33:05.718 --> 33:07.551
Francis, please, talk

33:07.553 --> 33:09.353
Some sense into your father.

33:09.355 --> 33:10.587
It's too late.

33:10.589 --> 33:12.356
We can't stop the invasion.

33:12.358 --> 33:14.057
And anyway,

33:14.059 --> 33:15.492
Father's right.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.094
What?

33:17.096 --> 33:20.230
We can take calais.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.599
Any fool knows he can't do that.

33:22.601 --> 33:24.701
It's true, father's army
would fail on its own.

33:24.703 --> 33:28.305
But two armies.

33:28.307 --> 33:30.374
One marching head on.

33:30.376 --> 33:33.076
The other across
this frozen marsh,

33:33.078 --> 33:34.745
Flanking the
english from behind.

33:34.747 --> 33:37.014
Do you mean the duke's army?
Mary's army?

33:38.216 --> 33:40.384
Mary will have to understand.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.619
I have no choice.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.421
I need

33:44.423 --> 33:47.691
The duke's army to save France.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.693
If we don't win this war,
it won't matter

33:49.695 --> 33:52.596
What happens with mary's mother.

33:52.598 --> 33:55.632
England will have its way
with both our countries.

33:56.768 --> 33:59.770
Father, if I do this,

33:59.772 --> 34:01.538
You have to cooperate.

34:01.540 --> 34:04.474
No more dismissing
anyone who disagrees.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.643
You will be a conqueror

34:06.645 --> 34:09.379
But only if we work together.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.715
Can you promise me that?

34:11.717 --> 34:13.683
My son,

34:13.685 --> 34:17.087
Making history
with me,

34:17.089 --> 34:21.224
Just like I've always dreamed.

34:33.738 --> 34:35.105
(knocking)

34:36.074 --> 34:37.707
(sighs)

34:37.709 --> 34:40.477
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior earlier.

34:40.479 --> 34:42.579
I hope I wasn't out of line.

34:42.581 --> 34:43.814
It's my father
who should be apologizing,

34:43.816 --> 34:45.582
Though he never would.

34:45.584 --> 34:48.585
No one's ever stood up
for me like that before.

34:48.587 --> 34:50.420
Or for my sisters.
I was surprised to see

34:50.422 --> 34:52.489
How quiet you acted
around your father.

34:52.491 --> 34:54.724
I've come to rather enjoy
your usual nature.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.860
Outspoken, bold.

34:56.862 --> 34:59.596
How long have you known
the truth about us?

34:59.598 --> 35:01.498
I've known
for some time.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.533
As a businessman,
I always do my research.

35:03.535 --> 35:07.471
But as a gentleman,
I-I wasn't about to bring it up.

35:07.473 --> 35:08.772
And as your future husband,
you should know I'm...

35:08.774 --> 35:10.740
Too rich to care.

35:12.376 --> 35:13.510
I can't thank you enough.

35:13.512 --> 35:14.845
No need
to thank me.

35:14.847 --> 35:17.481
Everyone deserves the chance
to find happiness.

35:17.483 --> 35:19.382
Just as I have.

35:19.384 --> 35:21.351
Which brings me
to this,

35:21.353 --> 35:23.620
I have something
I'd like you to look over.

35:23.622 --> 35:26.356
But promise me
you won't sign it

35:26.358 --> 35:27.858
Until you're ready.

35:34.599 --> 35:36.533
This is our wedding contract.

35:36.535 --> 35:38.301
Yes, and since
you're now

35:38.303 --> 35:40.704
In charge of all marriage
contracts for your family,

35:40.706 --> 35:44.574
It means nothing
without your approval.

35:47.211 --> 35:49.246
♪ and I fell

35:49.248 --> 35:57.587
♪ into a well of hope

35:59.624 --> 36:01.158
Is something wrong?

36:01.160 --> 36:03.293
No, that felt
surprisingly right.

36:05.329 --> 36:09.266
So you are taking
my mother's last hope,

36:09.268 --> 36:12.936
Leaving her to the mercy of
thousands of protestant rebels

36:12.938 --> 36:15.772
Demanding her head
and my crown.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.541
Mary, please
understand.

36:17.543 --> 36:19.776
I do understand.

36:19.778 --> 36:21.811
You're doing what you think
is best for your country.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.647
Not only
my country.

36:23.649 --> 36:26.650
If France is beaten at calais,
your country will suffer, too.

36:26.652 --> 36:29.619
France can hardly defend
scotland.
Defend scotland?

36:29.621 --> 36:31.588
When have you ever defended
scotland?

36:31.590 --> 36:33.657
Except with brave words?

36:33.659 --> 36:35.759
That is not fair.
Now you want fair?

36:35.761 --> 36:38.461
We are rulers,
not schoolchildren.

36:38.463 --> 36:41.198
Blood will be spilled because
of the choice you have made,

36:41.200 --> 36:43.433
My mother's blood.
You don't
know that.

36:43.435 --> 36:45.735
But the blood of thousands
would be spilled...
Yes,

36:45.737 --> 36:47.370
French blood, I know.
I do not

36:47.372 --> 36:49.673
Only think of France!

36:51.776 --> 36:54.477
No, you do not.

36:54.479 --> 36:56.780
But you do
put her first.

36:56.782 --> 36:58.982
As any king would.

36:58.984 --> 37:01.551
Then can you forgive me?

37:02.653 --> 37:03.920
It is myself

37:03.922 --> 37:05.655
I cannot forgive.

37:07.291 --> 37:08.925
I've made an awful mistake.

37:08.927 --> 37:11.728
Our marriage
was an awful mistake.

37:11.730 --> 37:15.232
Please don't say that.
There were a thousand moments
where I could've done something.

37:15.234 --> 37:18.868
Made secret treaties,
sold favors,

37:18.870 --> 37:21.471
Even snuck away to scotland

37:21.473 --> 37:23.640
To be with those people
who need me.

37:23.642 --> 37:26.476
And do you know
why I didn't?

37:26.478 --> 37:28.345
Because I love you.

37:29.380 --> 37:30.747
Because I am your wife.

37:30.749 --> 37:32.849
Mary, listen,
when we have taken calais,

37:32.851 --> 37:34.951
The first thing I will do
is travel to scotland

37:34.953 --> 37:36.653
With your uncle's army.

37:36.655 --> 37:38.655
We can still save your mother.

37:38.657 --> 37:40.423
Like when you promised
you would take me

37:40.425 --> 37:42.559
To scotland with my
brother? Like when you

37:42.561 --> 37:43.960
Promised soldiers
the time before that

37:43.962 --> 37:45.729
And the time before that?

37:45.731 --> 37:48.431
You make it sound like every
promise I make is an empty one.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.867
What other promise can you make?

37:50.869 --> 37:53.870
You are the future king.

37:53.872 --> 37:56.039
It's not that simple.

37:56.041 --> 37:57.741
Maybe it should be.

37:59.644 --> 38:01.411
For both of us.

38:01.413 --> 38:03.546
What does that mean?

38:04.615 --> 38:07.817
Nothing.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.953
I don't know.

38:15.526 --> 38:18.662
I'm only going
to ask two things of you.

38:22.700 --> 38:26.670
The first is that you stop
making me promises

38:26.672 --> 38:29.606
You know in your heart
you can't keep.

38:35.680 --> 38:38.682
And the other?

38:38.684 --> 38:40.483
(sniffles)

38:42.353 --> 38:43.820
Come back to me.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.724
Live through
this battle.

38:47.726 --> 38:50.060
And don't let England
cost me you.

39:00.471 --> 39:02.038
(trumpeting)
forward!

39:02.040 --> 39:05.442
Have faith, mary.
Francis is clever

39:05.444 --> 39:07.444
And strong.
He'll return home safely.

39:07.446 --> 39:09.979
I hope so.

39:09.981 --> 39:12.749
But even if he survives,

39:12.751 --> 39:15.618
Our marriage is...

39:15.620 --> 39:17.520
What?

39:17.522 --> 39:20.523
Francis is trying
to save his country,

39:20.525 --> 39:22.492
And I can forgive him
for that,

39:22.494 --> 39:25.095
As I hope he will forgive me

39:25.097 --> 39:26.930
For doing what needs to be done
for scotland,

39:26.932 --> 39:28.631
Whatever that may be.

39:28.633 --> 39:30.867
What if he can't
forgive you?

39:30.869 --> 39:34.371
Well, that will just be too bad.

39:34.373 --> 39:37.374
I won't let him put my country
at risk again.
