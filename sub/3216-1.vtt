When I told Dad I was scared of the thing
in my closet he gave me a .45.

What was he supposed to do?

08:35.974 --> 08:37.517
I was nine years old.

08:38.101 --> 08:40.646
He was supposed to say,
"Don't be afraid of the dark."

08:40.729 --> 08:42.397
"Don't be afraid of the dark"?
What you kidding me?

08:42.481 --> 08:45.234
Of course you should be afraid
of the dark. You know what's out there.

Yeah, I know. But still, the way we
grew up, after Mom was killed,

08:47.527 --> 08:49.863

to find the thing that killed her.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.949

-No. Not normal. Safe.

09:20.519 --> 09:23.313
It was Dad who said if I was
gonna go, I should stay gone.

09:23.939 --> 09:25.232
And that's what I'm doing.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.150

09:27.234 --> 09:29.152
If he's not dead already. I can feel it.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.156

09:33.282 --> 09:34.616

why didn't you go with him?

10:08.400 --> 10:09.484
All right. Here we go.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.696

this two-lane blacktop

10:12.779 --> 10:14.656
just outside of Jericho, California.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.241

10:16.325 --> 10:19.328
They found his car,
but he'd vanished, completely MIA.

10:20.579 --> 10:21.830

All men, all same
five-mile stretch of road.

10:34.843 --> 10:38.472
Started happening more and more,
so Dad went to go dig around.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.140
That was about three weeks ago.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.268
I hadn't heard from him since,
which is bad enough.

Not bad, Sammy.
Kind of like riding a bike, isn't it?

11:05.624 --> 11:08.710

and ran it through GoldWave,

took out the hiss and this is what I got.

No, thanks.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.200
So how'd you pay for that stuff?

16:32.283 --> 16:34.661
You and Dad still running
credit card scams?

16:34.744 --> 16:37.497
Yeah, well, hunting ain't
exactly a pro ball career.

16:39.207 --> 16:42.544
Besides, all we do is apply.
It's not our fault they send us the cards.

16:42.627 --> 16:46.297
Yeah? And what names did you write
on the application this time?

16:46.381 --> 16:50.176
Uh, Burt Aframian and his son Hector.

16:50.635 --> 16:53.263
-Scored two cards out of the deal.
-Sounds about right.

16:54.139 --> 16:57.058
I swear, man. You gotta
update your cassette tape collection.

-Why?
-Well, for one, they're cassette tapes.

No! Nothing!

No sign of struggle.
No footprints. No fingerprints.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.566
It's spotless. It's almost too clean.

18:28.650 --> 18:31.236

he's dating your daughter, isn't he?

like this just last month, didn't you?

18:47.335 --> 18:49.003

18:49.087 --> 18:51.381
You did have another
one just like this, correct?

Yeah, that's right.
About a mile up the road.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.926

19:00.390 --> 19:03.643
Any connection between the victims,
besides that they're all men?

No, not so far as we can tell.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.231

19:08.314 --> 19:09.941

Come on. They don't really
know what's going on.

19:34.215 --> 19:36.551
We're all alone on this.
I mean, if we're gonna find Dad,

we've gotta get to the bottom
of this thing ourselves.

-You must be Amy.
-Yeah.

Troy told us about you. We're his uncles.
I'm Dean. This is Sammy.

20:05.288 --> 20:06.873
He never mentioned you to me.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.374
Yeah, that's Troy, I guess.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.501
We're not around much,
we're up in Modesto.

20:10.585 --> 20:13.796

and we're kind of asking around.

-Yeah.

You mind if we ask you a couple questions?

20:19.385 --> 20:21.012
AMY: I was on the phone with Troy.

20:21.512 --> 20:22.805
He was driving home.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.641
He said he would call me right back.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.809
And, uh, he never did.

20:27.101 --> 20:29.771
He didn't say anything strange
or out of the ordinary?

20:30.355 --> 20:31.898
No, nothing I can remember.

What is it?

20:43.868 --> 20:47.956
Well, it's just... I mean, with all
these guys going missing, people talk.

20:48.039 --> 20:49.540
BOTH: What do they talk about?

20:52.877 --> 20:54.462
It's kind of this local legend.

20:55.213 --> 20:59.425
This one girl, she got murdered
out on Centennial, like, decades ago.

21:00.510 --> 21:02.470
Well, supposedly she's still out there.

21:03.513 --> 21:04.555
She hitchhikes.

21:05.139 --> 21:06.474
And whoever picks her up,

21:07.475 --> 21:09.811
well, they disappear forever.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.746
-Let me try.
-Got it.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.335
You're such a control freak.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.797
So, angry spirits are born
out of violent death, right?

21:37.880 --> 21:39.924
-Yeah.
-Maybe it's not murder.

21:48.933 --> 21:51.936
This was 1981.

and we're chasing him.

about things you've done?

30:24.031 --> 30:26.492
That's right.
We're working on a story together.

30:27.743 --> 30:30.829
Well, I don't know what the hell
kind of story you're working on.

30:30.913 --> 30:33.999
-The questions he asked me...
-About your late wife, Constance.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.418
He asked me where she was buried.

30:37.461 --> 30:39.046
And where is that again?

30:39.588 --> 30:41.173
I gotta go through this twice?

30:41.549 --> 30:43.509
It's fact-checking. If you don't mind.

30:46.470 --> 30:49.557
In a plot behind my old place,
over on Breckenridge.

30:50.391 --> 30:51.892
Why did you move?

30:53.644 --> 30:56.730
I'm not gonna live in the house
where my children died.

30:59.567 --> 31:01.360
Mr. Welch, did you ever marry again?

31:01.443 --> 31:02.444
No way.

31:03.279 --> 31:05.155
Constance, she was the love of my life.

31:07.074 --> 31:08.534
Prettiest woman I ever known.

31:08.993 --> 31:10.578
So you had a happy marriage?

31:13.998 --> 31:15.374
Definitely.

31:16.458 --> 31:17.835
(SAM INHALES DEEPLY)

31:17.918 --> 31:20.087
Well, that should do it.
Thanks for your time.

31:27.511 --> 31:28.929
(KEYS JANGLING)

31:31.015 --> 31:33.183
Mr. Welch, you ever hear
of a Woman in White?

31:34.268 --> 31:36.437
-A what?
-A Woman in White.

31:36.854 --> 31:38.355
Or sometimes Weeping Woman?

31:39.648 --> 31:41.483
It's a ghost story. Well... (CHUCKLES)

31:42.192 --> 31:44.069
It's more of a phenomenon, really.

31:44.361 --> 31:45.487
They're spirits.

31:45.571 --> 31:49.158
They've been sighted
for hundreds of years, dozens of places.

31:49.241 --> 31:52.286
In Hawaii, in Mexico.
Lately, in Arizona, Indiana.

31:52.369 --> 31:54.538
All these are different women,
you understand,

31:54.622 --> 31:56.040
but all share the same story.

31:57.458 --> 32:00.210
Boy, I don't care much for nonsense.

32:00.628 --> 32:02.296
See, when they were alive,

32:02.379 --> 32:04.256
their husbands were unfaithful to them.

32:05.591 --> 32:06.759
And these women,

32:06.842 --> 32:08.927
basically suffering
from temporary insanity,

32:09.011 --> 32:10.262
murdered their children.

32:11.722 --> 32:15.017
Then once they realized what they
had done, they took their own lives.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.394
So now their spirits are cursed.

32:17.478 --> 32:19.313
Walking backroads, waterways.

32:19.813 --> 32:22.483
And if they find an unfaithful man,
they kill him.

32:23.317 --> 32:24.985
And that man is never seen again.

32:26.779 --> 32:28.489
You think...

32:29.490 --> 32:31.700
You think that has something to do with...

32:31.784 --> 32:33.077
Constance,

32:33.661 --> 32:34.828
you smart-ass?

32:35.496 --> 32:36.664
You tell me.

32:40.042 --> 32:41.460
I mean, maybe,

32:42.127 --> 32:43.837
maybe I made some mistakes.

32:45.089 --> 32:46.507
But no matter what I did,

32:47.091 --> 32:49.802
Constance, she never would have
killed her own children.

32:51.595 --> 32:53.180
Now you get the hell out of here.

32:54.223 --> 32:55.933
And you don't come back.

32:57.851 --> 32:59.812
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

33:11.156 --> 33:13.283
I don't know how many times
I gotta tell you,

33:13.367 --> 33:14.993
it's my high school locker combo.

33:15.369 --> 33:17.121
We gonna do this all night long?

33:17.204 --> 33:20.040
We just got a 911.
Shots fired over at Whiteford Road.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.544
You have to go to the bathroom?

33:24.169 --> 33:25.879
-No.
-Good.

I don't know. That's pretty illegal.

34:03.250 --> 34:05.419
-You're welcome.
-Listen, we gotta talk.

34:05.502 --> 34:08.130
Tell me about it.
So the husband was unfaithful.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.007
We are dealing with a Woman in White.

34:10.090 --> 34:11.258
And she's buried behind her old house,

34:11.341 --> 34:12.468
so that should've been Dad's next stop.

34:12.551 --> 34:13.927
Sammy, would you shut up for a second?

34:14.011 --> 34:16.305
I just can't figure out why he hasn't
destroyed the corpse yet.

that's what I'm trying to tell you.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.141
He's gone.

-Dad left Jericho.
-What?

34:20.851 --> 34:21.935
How do you know?

34:22.728 --> 34:23.729
I've got his journal.

34:23.812 --> 34:25.773
He doesn't go anywhere
without that thing.

34:25.856 --> 34:28.025
-Yeah, well, he did this time.
-What's it say?

where he's going.

Where to?
