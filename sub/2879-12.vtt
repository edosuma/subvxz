WEBVTT

00:02.029 --> 00:05.031
Well, I must say, Leonard,
when I first heard

00:05.033 --> 00:09.586
your idea for Giant Jenga,
I was skeptical.

00:11.005 --> 00:15.375
I can't blame you-- Tiny Twister
was a complete bust.

00:15.377 --> 00:16.593
No, I was wrong.

00:16.595 --> 00:19.296
The looming threat
of being crushed

00:19.298 --> 00:22.933
under a pile of lumber
does add a certain spice.

00:24.468 --> 00:26.553
I've never felt so alive.

00:27.805 --> 00:30.390
(knock on door)

00:30.392 --> 00:32.893
Oh, hello, Alex.

00:32.895 --> 00:34.978
Uh, let me go get you
last night's recordings.

00:34.980 --> 00:36.196
What recordings?

00:36.198 --> 00:38.732
Well, you remember when
you told me I talk in my sleep?

00:38.734 --> 00:41.401
Well, it occurred to me that,
like most things I say,

00:41.403 --> 00:43.937
it's probably pure gold.

00:43.939 --> 00:46.072
So I started recording it all,

00:46.074 --> 00:47.707
and now Alex gets
to comb through

00:47.709 --> 00:50.794
eight hours of what I like
to call "Sheldon After Dark."

00:50.796 --> 00:53.547
Hey, Leonard.
Hey.

00:53.549 --> 00:55.549
Just playing a little
Giant Jenga here.

00:55.551 --> 00:57.968
Oh, I know-- I'm the one
who had to buy him the helmet.

00:58.869 --> 01:01.254
So, do you have any plans
this weekend?

01:01.256 --> 01:03.440
Well, most of Saturday's
gonna be figuring out

01:03.442 --> 01:05.090
where to put this game
when we're done.

01:05.093 --> 01:06.760
How about you?

01:06.762 --> 01:08.678
Oh, I'm gonna go see
Kip Thorne give a lecture

01:08.680 --> 01:11.314
on subatomic space-time.
Ooh.

01:11.316 --> 01:13.516
That's his take on John
Wheeler's quantum foam.

01:13.518 --> 01:14.651
That should be great.

01:14.653 --> 01:16.987
Well, if you want,
you can come with me.

01:16.989 --> 01:19.272
Ah, I'd love to, but I'm
supposed to hang out with Penny.

01:19.274 --> 01:20.240
Well, bring her.

01:20.242 --> 01:21.241
Well, she's not really

01:21.243 --> 01:22.742
into that kind of stuff.

01:22.744 --> 01:24.110
Yeah, okay.

01:24.112 --> 01:25.728
Well, if you want to hear
about the lecture,

01:25.730 --> 01:28.365
I can tell you all about it
at work, or, you know,

01:28.367 --> 01:29.783
over dinner sometime.

01:29.785 --> 01:31.251
What?

01:34.355 --> 01:37.123

02:07.544 --> 02:09.895
Oh, come on, that
can't be true.

02:09.896 --> 02:12.598
I did the research--
Tony the Tiger,

02:12.600 --> 02:16.352
Dig'em the Frog, Cap'n Crunch,
Toucan Sam, Count Chocula,

02:16.354 --> 02:19.905
Trix the Rabbit,
Snap, Crackle and Pop.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.858
Not one cereal
mascot is a girl.

02:23.743 --> 02:28.063
It's a total breakfast
sausage fest.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.532
Are we done with this?

02:29.534 --> 02:32.084
Almost-- Franken Berry,
Boo Berry,

02:32.086 --> 02:34.236
Sugar Bear and the
Honey Nut Cheerio bee,

02:34.238 --> 02:36.738
I believe his name is Buzz.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.240
Terrific.

02:38.242 --> 02:40.576
Something weird happened and I
don't know what to do about it.

02:40.578 --> 02:41.460
What's going on?

02:41.462 --> 02:42.678
Sheldon's assistant asked me

02:42.680 --> 02:43.796
on a date last night.

02:43.798 --> 02:45.631
How could you do that to me?

02:45.633 --> 02:48.217
You know I've been working it
with Alex for weeks.

02:48.219 --> 02:50.886
Working it?
You can't even talk to her.

02:50.888 --> 02:53.088
I talk with my eyes.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.946
You look like
my little cousin

03:00.948 --> 03:03.616
when he's dropping
one in his diaper.

03:03.618 --> 03:06.235
She knows I have a girlfriend.

03:06.237 --> 03:08.153
It's so weird.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.955
Oh, my God. You're
loving this.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.273
To my bones.

03:11.275 --> 03:12.608
(chuckling)

03:12.610 --> 03:14.943
I mean, I'm not gonna do
anything about it.

03:14.945 --> 03:18.047
I love Penny. It's just nice to
have a young, attractive woman

03:18.049 --> 03:19.915
sniffing around the goods.

03:19.917 --> 03:22.885
I both hate you
and want to be you.

03:22.887 --> 03:26.422
This is Ryan Gosling
all over again.

03:26.424 --> 03:27.840
Aw, gentlemen.

03:27.842 --> 03:30.726
What is on the conversational
menu this morning?

03:30.728 --> 03:32.511
Leonard stole my woman,
and he knew full well

03:32.513 --> 03:35.431
I was only six to eight months
away from making my move.

03:36.349 --> 03:38.350
I didn't steal anyone.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.235
Your assistant is totally
hitting on this jerk

03:40.237 --> 03:41.520
and he loves it.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.906
Well, that's not
acceptable.

03:43.908 --> 03:45.474
I'm her boss.

03:45.476 --> 03:47.776
She needs to be solely
focused on my needs,

03:47.778 --> 03:52.865
not distracted by your pasty,
androgynous brand of sexuality.

03:53.583 --> 03:55.984
<i>I'm</i> androgynous?

03:55.986 --> 03:57.486
Oh, please.
Look at you

03:57.488 --> 04:00.372
with your pouty
bee-stung lips.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.675
What do you guys
think I should do?

04:02.677 --> 04:05.544
I say you tell Alex
your heart belongs to Penny,

04:05.546 --> 04:07.429
I provide her a shoulder
to cry on,

04:07.431 --> 04:10.666
and then roughly half a year
later I give it to her good.

04:13.353 --> 04:16.805
I want to thank you all for
coming on such short notice.

04:16.807 --> 04:18.807
Uh, in the past,
I've reached out

04:18.809 --> 04:21.176
to each of you
individually, but

04:21.178 --> 04:23.562
I believe my present situation

04:23.564 --> 04:26.565
requires the collective wisdom
of the group,

04:26.567 --> 04:29.851
which as you can see from
your commemorative T-shirts

04:29.853 --> 04:31.687
I have dubbed

04:31.689 --> 04:35.924
Sheldon Cooper's
Council of Ladies.

04:37.544 --> 04:39.712
What is happening?

04:39.714 --> 04:44.633
I need your advice about
a delicate workplace situation.

04:44.635 --> 04:46.368
Uh, to protect
those involved,

04:46.370 --> 04:48.470
I'll be changing their names.

04:48.472 --> 04:49.838
Who's involved?

04:49.840 --> 04:53.208
Well, a short, bespectacled
colleague of mine

04:53.210 --> 04:56.929
who lives in the shadow
of his brilliant roommate.

04:56.931 --> 04:58.130
Let's call

04:58.132 --> 05:01.934
this colleague
Ricardo Shilly-Shally.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.053
You're talking
about Leonard.

05:04.055 --> 05:07.823
No, no, Shilly-Shally
has red hair

05:07.825 --> 05:12.077
and, uh, he briefly served
in the Mexican Navy.

05:14.547 --> 05:17.700
Anyway, despite the fact
that he has a girlfriend,

05:17.702 --> 05:20.235
Shilly-Shally has been
the recipient

05:20.237 --> 05:23.922
of inappropriate workplace
flirtations from a young lady.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.507
It's your assistant Alex,
isn't it?

05:25.509 --> 05:27.743
(stutters)
No.

05:27.745 --> 05:32.131
Not... No. This is
Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.283
Wait, what the hell's
going on

05:34.285 --> 05:35.801
with Leonard and Alex?
(stutters) No,

05:35.803 --> 05:37.936
I'm sorry. Who's talking
about Leonard and Alex?

05:37.938 --> 05:38.920
W...

05:38.922 --> 05:42.024
Fine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.

05:42.026 --> 05:44.810
Okay, look, it's not really
about Ricardo and Tondelaya.

05:44.812 --> 05:47.279
It is really about her boss,

05:47.281 --> 05:48.564
who doesn't quite know

05:48.566 --> 05:50.115
how to handle this situation

05:50.117 --> 05:51.617
and could use your advice,

05:51.619 --> 05:56.288
which is surprising because
Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm...

05:57.557 --> 05:59.992
He's usually pretty smart
about these things.

05:59.994 --> 06:02.327
(groans)
I'm gonna kill her.

06:02.329 --> 06:03.912
I'm sure you've got nothing
to worry about.

06:03.914 --> 06:05.547
Leonard would never
cheat on you.

06:05.549 --> 06:06.548
She's right.

06:06.550 --> 06:08.383
But say the word--
I got a lab full

06:08.385 --> 06:11.620
of cocaine-addicted monkeys
with nothing to lose.

06:12.889 --> 06:15.974
One of them could end up
in the backseat of her car.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.177
Or her shower.

06:19.629 --> 06:20.813
Ladies, ladies, please.

06:20.815 --> 06:22.397
We're not here to talk
about Penny, okay?

06:22.399 --> 06:23.899
We're here to talk about me.

06:23.901 --> 06:26.735
Uh, I mean Einstein
Von Brainst... Oh, darn it!

06:26.737 --> 06:29.304
All right, I guess
the cat's out of the bag.

06:29.306 --> 06:30.773
Let me explain what's

06:30.775 --> 06:32.808
going on-- Ricardo is really

06:32.810 --> 06:35.360
Leonard...
We know what's going on, Sheldon!

06:36.246 --> 06:37.996
Well, what should I do?

06:37.998 --> 06:39.865
Well, Alex is
your employee.

06:39.867 --> 06:42.251
If she's doing something that's
making Leonard uncomfortable,

06:42.253 --> 06:43.819
you should talk to her.

06:43.821 --> 06:45.370
Oh, no, he's not
uncomfortable at all.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.371
No, he's loving it.

06:46.373 --> 06:47.422
Yeah, he's
strutting

06:47.424 --> 06:49.958
around like he's five-foot-six.

06:50.860 --> 06:52.160
What... He's loving it?

06:52.162 --> 06:53.128
BERNADETTE:
Sheldon,

06:53.130 --> 06:54.880
you need to talk
to Alex right away.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.799
Talk to her?
That's all you've got?

06:56.801 --> 06:59.718
With a cool name like Sheldon
Cooper's Council of Ladies,

06:59.720 --> 07:01.637
I really expected more.

07:01.639 --> 07:03.839
Give me back the T-shirts.

07:05.000 --> 07:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:15.401 --> 07:16.702
Alex...

07:16.704 --> 07:18.403
check my schedule.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.656
What does my afternoon look like?
I think

07:20.658 --> 07:21.957
it's pretty wide open.

07:21.959 --> 07:24.676
Oh, wait.
Here's something at 4:00.

07:24.678 --> 07:27.496
"Give Alex a talking to"?

07:29.031 --> 07:31.250
Well, that snuck up
on us, didn't it?

07:31.252 --> 07:34.169
Is there a problem?
Let's not

07:34.171 --> 07:35.537
call it a problem.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.723
Let's call it an opportunity.

07:37.725 --> 07:40.008
To solve a serious problem.

07:40.844 --> 07:41.944
What did I do?

07:41.946 --> 07:44.646
You don't know?
Oh, you poor dear.

07:44.648 --> 07:46.598
Your ovaries are squirting
so much goofy juice

07:46.600 --> 07:49.384
into your brains you don't
even know which way is up.

07:51.571 --> 07:56.925
You made an inappropriate sexual
advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.

07:56.927 --> 08:00.779
What? I didn't make
a sexual advance on anybody.

08:00.781 --> 08:03.081
Now, there's no need
to get defensive.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.416
I'm not
unsympathetic

08:04.418 --> 08:05.617
to your plight.

08:05.619 --> 08:08.587
My father used to say
that a woman

08:08.589 --> 08:13.909
is like an egg salad sandwich
on a warm Texas day.

08:14.744 --> 08:17.379
What?

08:17.381 --> 08:21.383
Full of eggs and only appealing
for a short time.

08:21.385 --> 08:24.219
This conversation is
making me uncomfortable.

08:24.221 --> 08:25.253
Yeah,

08:25.255 --> 08:26.271
you and me both, sister.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.757
Now,

08:28.759 --> 08:30.692
please understand...

08:30.694 --> 08:34.229
I don't hold you responsible
for your behavior

08:34.231 --> 08:36.398
because, see, from an
evolutionary standpoint,

08:36.400 --> 08:39.318
you're a slave
to your desire to reproduce.

08:39.320 --> 08:41.102
But during
the work day,

08:41.104 --> 08:45.106
when you feel possessed by
amorous intent, may I suggest

08:45.108 --> 08:47.943
that you suppress it
by leafing through

08:47.945 --> 08:51.163
this illustrated book of
sexually transmitted diseases?

08:51.165 --> 08:53.799
Let's see here.
Oh, yes.

08:53.801 --> 08:56.001
Check out this oozy doozy.

08:58.988 --> 09:00.138
I have to go.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.473
So does this fellow,

09:01.475 --> 09:04.009
but he can't without it
burning like hot soup.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.448
(Leonard whistling)

09:10.566 --> 09:12.651
Hey, pretty lady.

09:12.653 --> 09:15.354
Oh, you seem extra happy.

09:15.356 --> 09:16.355
Uh, I guess I am.

09:16.357 --> 09:18.023
Any particular reason why?

09:18.025 --> 09:20.108
Mm, I don't know,
just having a good day.

09:20.110 --> 09:21.360
This morning Sheldon
fell asleep

09:21.362 --> 09:23.144
on the way to work, so I got
to listen to the radio--

09:23.146 --> 09:25.313
that was pretty crazy.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.499
Mm-hmm. Anything else?

09:27.501 --> 09:29.117
Mm. I found this quiz online

09:29.119 --> 09:30.953
called "Which <i>Star Trek</i>
Character Are You?"

09:30.955 --> 09:34.256
and it only took me four tries
to get Captain Kirk.

09:34.258 --> 09:35.757
That's great.

09:35.759 --> 09:39.327
(imitating William Shatner):
Oh. It. Was.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.879
Hmm. Well, I'm glad
you're having such a great day.

09:41.904 --> 09:42.298
Yeah.

09:42.299 --> 09:45.050
And the one thing that could
make it even better

09:45.052 --> 09:47.335
is an evening
with my special girl.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.503
Oh, and who's that?

09:48.505 --> 09:50.171
What do you mean?

09:50.173 --> 09:52.808
Oh, I just didn't know
if you meant me or Alex.

09:52.810 --> 09:54.860
Um, why would I mean Alex?

09:54.862 --> 09:57.779
Because I know she hit on you
and I know you liked it!

09:57.781 --> 09:59.948
What...?

10:01.651 --> 10:05.037
Don't play dumb with me,
Ricardo Shilly-Shally!

10:10.660 --> 10:13.829
I'm missing something.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.666
Did you say something
to Penny about Alex?

10:17.668 --> 10:21.503
Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot
of good it did me.

10:21.505 --> 10:24.089
All she did was get mad at you.

10:24.974 --> 10:27.025
Why would you do that?

10:27.027 --> 10:29.144
I needed advice
about a woman.

10:29.146 --> 10:30.479
I would have asked you,

10:30.481 --> 10:32.764
but if the last few years
have proven anything,

10:32.766 --> 10:35.434
it's that you can't tell
a uterus from a unicycle.

10:35.436 --> 10:38.937
At least <i>I</i> know
not to blab to a girl

10:38.939 --> 10:41.656
about somebody flirting
with her boyfriend.

10:41.658 --> 10:43.058
(electronic tones sounding)
Good to know.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.659
Yeah, a few more
helpful hints like that,

10:44.661 --> 10:47.062
you may find yourself
on the Council of Ladies.

10:47.064 --> 10:49.247
Hello.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.832
I see.

10:50.834 --> 10:53.234
Uh, what time?

10:53.236 --> 10:55.337
Very well, then.

10:55.339 --> 10:56.671
Huh.

10:56.673 --> 11:00.175
That was the Human Resources
Department at the university.

11:00.177 --> 11:03.512
Apparently, my assistant Alex
has filed a complaint

11:03.514 --> 11:07.248
accusing me of inappropriate
behavior in the workplace.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.935
Oh, my God, what did you do?

11:09.937 --> 11:12.187
Hmm, let me think.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.390
Nothing. I'm a delight.

11:26.202 --> 11:28.687
Human Resources Department.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.656
Human Resources Department.

11:30.658 --> 11:32.841
Human Resources
Department.

11:33.358 --> 11:35.092
Come in.

11:35.094 --> 11:37.611
Hello.

11:37.613 --> 11:39.879
Ah, Dr. Cooper, have a seat.

11:39.881 --> 11:40.568
Thank you.

11:40.593 --> 11:42.705
I called you in today
because your assistant

11:42.805 --> 11:45.283
Alex Jensen has lodged
a complaint against you.

11:45.503 --> 11:47.670
So I've been told.
But I can't understand

11:47.672 --> 11:49.421
what she has to complain about.

11:49.423 --> 11:52.991
I mean, she has a front-row seat
as I make scientific history.

11:52.993 --> 11:54.343
There's string cheese

11:54.345 --> 11:56.929
in my mini-fridge,
and that's for anyone.

11:56.931 --> 11:58.380
Yeah, and
just yesterday

11:58.382 --> 12:02.434
I led her away from a life
of sexual promiscuity

12:02.436 --> 12:06.722
by making her look at pictures
of disease-ridden genitalia.

12:12.195 --> 12:14.313
Cancel my next appointment.

12:14.315 --> 12:16.348
This is gonna take a while.

12:16.350 --> 12:18.567
Dr. Cooper,

12:18.569 --> 12:20.069
you said things to your employee

12:20.071 --> 12:22.354
that you just cannot say
in the workplace.

12:22.356 --> 12:24.022
Like what?

12:24.024 --> 12:26.292
Well, according
to Ms. Jensen,

12:26.294 --> 12:29.878
you said that she was a slave
to her biological urges

12:29.880 --> 12:33.649
and called her
an "egg salad sandwich."

12:36.319 --> 12:38.203
I don't even know
what that means,

12:38.205 --> 12:41.423
but I'm gonna go ahead
and tell you you can't say it.

12:42.259 --> 12:45.427
Oh! I see the confusion here.

12:45.429 --> 12:48.597
No, no, Alex thought
I was singling her out. No.

12:48.599 --> 12:50.482
I meant that <i>all</i> women

12:50.484 --> 12:52.434
are slaves to their
biological urges,

12:52.436 --> 12:53.852
you know?

12:53.854 --> 12:55.554
Even you.

12:56.740 --> 12:59.391
You're a slave.

13:03.062 --> 13:05.164
I'm a what?

13:05.166 --> 13:07.499
Well, y-you...
I-I'm just saying,

13:07.501 --> 13:10.119
you know, at a certain point
in a woman's menstrual cycle...

13:10.121 --> 13:12.004
Whuh-ah!

13:12.006 --> 13:14.089
You can't talk about that,
either, Dr. Cooper.

13:14.091 --> 13:15.858
Your language
is entirely

13:15.860 --> 13:17.409
inappropriate,
and I'm gonna advise

13:17.411 --> 13:19.261
that you shut your mouth
right now.

13:19.263 --> 13:22.381
I d... I don't see why <i>I'm</i>
the one being persecuted here.

13:22.383 --> 13:25.917
Dr. Hofstadter-- he was bragging
about his sexual desirability

13:25.919 --> 13:27.586
to anyone who would listen.

13:27.588 --> 13:28.887
You know, and
Howard Wolowitz--

13:28.889 --> 13:32.257
he spent two years
using university resources

13:32.259 --> 13:34.610
building a six-breasted
sex robot.

13:34.612 --> 13:35.927
Oh,

13:35.929 --> 13:37.363
and at the office
Christmas party,

13:37.365 --> 13:40.282
I heard Rajesh Koothrappali
refer to you several times

13:40.284 --> 13:42.484
as "Brown Sugar."

13:44.871 --> 13:46.372
Hofstadter...

13:46.374 --> 13:47.489
Wolowitz...

13:47.491 --> 13:50.275
and the last one was
Rajesh Koothrappali?

13:50.277 --> 13:51.593
Yes.

13:51.595 --> 13:54.213
No, yeah, but in his defense,
that wasn't racist.

13:54.215 --> 13:55.914
He's also brown.

13:59.952 --> 14:02.054
(knocking)

14:02.056 --> 14:07.092
(to "Mary Had a Little Lamb"):
♪ I'm... sorry Alex hit on me ♪

14:07.094 --> 14:08.644
♪ Hit on me

14:08.646 --> 14:11.930
♪ Hit on me...

14:11.932 --> 14:13.315
♪ Sorry Alex

14:13.317 --> 14:16.568
♪ Hit on me,
I'd no idea I'm cute. ♪

14:16.570 --> 14:19.271
(plucks closing chord)

14:20.807 --> 14:23.025
Oh, damn it, you are.

14:23.027 --> 14:24.610
Please forgive me.

14:24.612 --> 14:27.378
I should have told
you about Alex.

14:27.478 --> 14:28.794
I don't care
about Alex.

14:28.816 --> 14:30.249
Fine, I care.

14:30.251 --> 14:32.284
Okay, I hate that bitch.

14:32.286 --> 14:33.869
But what really
hurt is that

14:33.871 --> 14:35.120
you liked it so much.

14:35.122 --> 14:36.988
I mean, do I need
to be worried?

14:36.990 --> 14:39.792
Of course not. No. Why?
Because...

14:39.794 --> 14:42.044
she is pretty and smart,
and when you talk about work,

14:42.046 --> 14:44.763
she doesn't have to go home
and look up words in the dictionary

14:44.765 --> 14:45.881
to understand what you said.

14:45.883 --> 14:47.299
You do that?

14:47.301 --> 14:49.301
No.

14:50.854 --> 14:52.838
Hang on.
Are you feeling insecure?

14:52.840 --> 14:54.757
Because that's
<i>my</i> thing, and if

14:54.759 --> 14:58.677
you take it away, I don't know
what I'm bringing to this relationship.

14:58.679 --> 15:00.612
Yes, Leonard, I am insecure.

15:00.614 --> 15:02.064
Happy?
No,

15:02.066 --> 15:04.366
I'm not <i>happy.</i>

15:07.687 --> 15:10.689
Why are you smiling?
I'm sorry.

15:10.691 --> 15:14.025
I just never think of you
having feelings like that.

15:14.027 --> 15:15.544
Well, I do.
Why?

15:15.546 --> 15:18.380
Nothing is ever going to
happen between me and Alex.

15:18.382 --> 15:21.032
Good.

15:21.034 --> 15:23.285
(chuckles):
Come here.

15:24.971 --> 15:26.922
I'll tell you a secret?

15:26.924 --> 15:29.708
What's that?
With all these women chasing me,

15:29.710 --> 15:32.711
I kind of do feel
like Captain Kirk. (laughs)

15:32.713 --> 15:35.013
Can I tell you a secret?
Sure.

15:35.015 --> 15:39.601
Keep talking about Captain Kirk,
and we're all gonna stop.

15:39.603 --> 15:42.020
(like William Shatner):
Message... received.

15:46.075 --> 15:48.327
(phone ringing)
Ah, excuse me.

15:49.946 --> 15:51.180
Hello.

15:51.182 --> 15:53.749
This is Dr. Hofstadter.

15:53.751 --> 15:55.617
Okay.

15:57.253 --> 15:59.788
All right, thank you.

15:59.790 --> 16:01.340
That's weird.

16:01.342 --> 16:05.160
I'm getting called in
to Human Resources.

16:05.162 --> 16:06.912
What did you do?

16:06.914 --> 16:09.381
I don't know.

16:09.383 --> 16:11.583
Huh. I just
got called in

16:11.585 --> 16:14.052
to Human Resources.

16:14.054 --> 16:15.387
Why?

16:15.389 --> 16:17.523
I don't know.
(nervous laugh)

16:17.525 --> 16:19.842
Huh. That is so strange.

16:19.844 --> 16:22.444
Human Resources wants
to talk to me tomorrow.

16:22.446 --> 16:24.163
Could you stop licking
your ass for two minutes?

16:24.188 --> 16:25.497
I have a problem here.

16:36.292 --> 16:38.961
Do you really think you
should be drinking right now?

16:38.963 --> 16:43.465
How else am I supposed to talk
to the Human Resources lady?

16:43.467 --> 16:45.951
I don't know.
Seek professional help?

16:45.953 --> 16:48.003
I <i>did.</i> The guy at
the liquor store said

16:48.005 --> 16:51.256
this stuff tastes
great in coffee.

16:51.258 --> 16:53.675
Wait, you got
called in, too?

16:53.677 --> 16:55.126
What is going on?

16:55.128 --> 16:57.145
Sheldon threw us
all under the bus.

16:57.147 --> 16:58.019
Oh.

16:58.044 --> 17:00.044
I feel like I've been called
down to the principal's office.

17:00.267 --> 17:03.185
Although I wouldn't mind
if Brown Sugar suspended me.

17:05.238 --> 17:07.522
From a sex swing!

17:08.358 --> 17:10.943
This may have been a mistake.

17:11.994 --> 17:14.311
Relax. Everything's
gonna be fine.

17:14.314 --> 17:15.914
You know, before
I met Bernadette

17:15.915 --> 17:17.915
I was in here
every other day.

17:17.917 --> 17:19.917
Uh, little tip:

17:19.920 --> 17:23.872
turn off your "I Like Big Butts"
ringtone before you go in.

17:24.958 --> 17:27.342
Well, this is
all your fault.

17:27.344 --> 17:28.627
How is this <i>my</i> fault?
If you weren't

17:28.629 --> 17:29.878
screwing around
with Sheldon's assistant,

17:29.880 --> 17:31.463
none of this would be happening.
I wasn't

17:31.465 --> 17:32.998
screwing around with anyone.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.049
Oh, of course not.

17:34.051 --> 17:35.884
She was just sniffing
around your goods

17:35.886 --> 17:38.470
because she was hunting
for truffles.

17:38.472 --> 17:42.224
Ah, Mr. Wolowitz,
it's been a while.

17:42.226 --> 17:43.358
Hey, Janine.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.727
(chuckles)
How are Tom and the kids?

17:45.729 --> 17:47.178
Fine.

17:47.180 --> 17:49.147
You must be
Dr. Hofstadter.

17:49.149 --> 17:51.850
Yes, but I think this is all
a big misunderstanding.

17:51.852 --> 17:53.035
Yeah, yeah, me, too.

17:53.037 --> 17:54.736
I didn't do anything.

17:54.738 --> 17:56.488
Is that alcohol on your breath?

17:56.490 --> 17:59.992
Howard built a sex robot.

18:02.829 --> 18:04.162
That is not true.

18:04.164 --> 18:06.248
All I did was
build a robot.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.866
Did it have six breasts?

18:07.868 --> 18:09.968
I'm sorry,
I'm a feminist--

18:09.970 --> 18:11.970
(chuckles) I don't
notice things like

18:11.972 --> 18:15.591
how many breasts
a robot has.

18:15.593 --> 18:17.426
Well, hello.

18:17.428 --> 18:19.878
What are you doing here?
Actually, I came

18:19.880 --> 18:22.648
to speak to Mrs. Davis.
And I'm a little busy right now.

18:22.650 --> 18:24.349
But I came to file a complaint.

18:24.351 --> 18:27.819
Yeah, somebody has made me feel
uncomfortable in the workplace

18:27.821 --> 18:30.906
by using language of an
inappropriate and sexual nature.

18:30.908 --> 18:32.124
And who was that?

18:32.126 --> 18:33.575
You, you dirty birdie.

18:35.411 --> 18:36.745
I-I thought

18:36.747 --> 18:38.413
about the things
you said to me yesterday,

18:38.415 --> 18:39.781
and I realized
I'm deeply offended.

18:39.783 --> 18:43.168
Now, be a dear and get me
one of those complaint forms.

18:43.170 --> 18:44.202
That's it.

18:44.204 --> 18:46.838
All of you,
in my office now!

18:50.009 --> 18:52.492
And thanks to you, I
know better than to ask

18:52.517 --> 18:54.120
if you're menstruating.

18:57.266 --> 18:59.434
And based on your behavior,
I don't have to.

19:02.138 --> 19:03.939
It has been

19:03.941 --> 19:06.141
pointed out to me that...

19:06.143 --> 19:08.527
some of the things I said to you

19:08.529 --> 19:11.480
could be construed as...
offensive,

19:11.482 --> 19:13.148
and I would like

19:13.150 --> 19:16.652
to offer you
my sincerest apology.

19:16.654 --> 19:18.704
Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
Yeah,

19:18.706 --> 19:21.156
additionally, you should know
that the university

19:21.158 --> 19:23.075
has mandated that I take

19:23.077 --> 19:25.944
an online
sexual harassment seminar

19:25.946 --> 19:29.047
so this sort of thing
doesn't happen in the future.

19:29.049 --> 19:31.083
Okay.
Yeah. Now,

19:31.085 --> 19:34.886
unfortunately, uh,
my time is much too valuable

19:34.888 --> 19:37.556
to waste on nonsense like this,

19:37.558 --> 19:41.760
so... um, I'm gonna need you
to take it for me.

19:44.414 --> 19:46.264
Oh, and, uh,
you'd better ace it--

19:46.266 --> 19:47.482
they're pretty mad.

19:57.653 --> 19:59.693
So, hey, I was thinking
about that stuff with Alex.

19:59.694 --> 20:01.577
Oh, would you stop
worrying about that?

20:01.579 --> 20:03.412
I can't help it.
But, look, I figured

20:03.414 --> 20:05.014
I could sit around
and feel insecure,

20:05.016 --> 20:06.766
or I could do
something about it.

20:06.768 --> 20:08.067
So I got a course catalog

20:08.069 --> 20:11.104
at school and looked
at some of the science classes.

20:11.106 --> 20:11.873
That's great.

20:11.898 --> 20:13.857
No, it isn't--
they are extremely boring.

20:13.858 --> 20:16.609
I mean, how do you not
kill yourself, like, every day?

20:16.611 --> 20:19.095
Anyway, I decided

20:19.097 --> 20:22.398
I don't need to <i>be</i> a scientist,
I could just look like one.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.266
So I bought these.

20:24.268 --> 20:25.518
Glasses?

20:25.520 --> 20:26.936
Mm-hmm.
I really don't think

20:26.938 --> 20:28.871

oh, my God,

20:28.873 --> 20:31.273
you look so
smart and hot!

20:31.275 --> 20:33.710
I know, right?
Watch this.

20:39.029 --> 20:41.230
Molecules.

20:43.061 --> 20:44.527
Okay, come with me.

20:44.529 --> 20:45.528
Where are we going?

20:45.530 --> 20:47.281
To my bedroom,
so I can take everything off

20:47.283 --> 20:48.582
but those glasses...

20:49.211 --> 20:50.433
and maybe the boots.
