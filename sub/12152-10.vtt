00:01.213 --> 00:02.202
Previously on Angel:

00:02.373 --> 00:06.605
When I was a higher being, I could
see everything you ever did as Angelus.

00:06.813 --> 00:09.373
I love you, Angel, but
I can't be with you.

00:09.573 --> 00:11.086
This is where you were born.

00:16.933 --> 00:20.892
You never had a family or
friends or anything that's real.

00:21.093 --> 00:25.371
-  And if this is the end, then I
want you to have something that is.

00:25.573 --> 00:28.610
Last night will always be
special, but it can't happen again.

00:28.813 --> 00:31.407
Take your new boyfriend and
get the hell out of here.

00:31.613 --> 00:32.682
- Get over it.
- What?

00:32.853 --> 00:35.003
There are bigger things at stake.

00:35.213 --> 00:37.044
Connor's scared you think
he's connected to the Beast.

00:37.253 --> 00:39.608
It does tend to show
up whenever he's around.

00:39.773 --> 00:40.842
-  We discovered the Beast's plan.

00:41.013 --> 00:42.890
To blot out the sun for all of eternity.

00:43.453 --> 00:45.011
-  The sun, it's gone.

00:45.173 --> 00:49.212
I had a vision of you, long ago, standing
in a field of bodies with the Beast.

00:50.013 --> 00:52.686
- This wasn't about Connor. It's about...
- Angelus.

00:52.853 --> 00:54.605
I don't know this Beast.

00:54.813 --> 00:57.566
But Angelus might. We need Angelus.

00:59.693 --> 01:00.808
Officials from...

01:00.973 --> 01:02.929
... the National Weather
Service remain baffled...

01:03.093 --> 01:05.891
... as to the cause of
this strange phenomenon.

01:06.053 --> 01:08.567
All that's being reported
at this mid-afternoon hour...

01:08.733 --> 01:12.282
... is what meteorologists are calling,
quote, "a localized abnormality"...

01:12.453 --> 01:16.332
... confirming earlier reports that
outlying areas remain unaffected...

01:16.533 --> 01:19.764
... while the sun over Los Angeles
has, for all intents and purposes...

01:19.933 --> 01:21.685
... been blotted out from the sky.

01:21.893 --> 01:25.124
The mayor's office scheduled a news
conference for 6:00 this evening...

01:25.293 --> 01:28.603
... regarding this bizarre development
and what it may mean for the city.

01:28.773 --> 01:30.570
-  I'll tell you what it means.

01:30.733 --> 01:33.691
As soon as vamps realize this
town's open for business 24/7...

01:33.893 --> 01:36.168
...there's gonna be a huge
rise in undead tourism.

01:36.333 --> 01:38.767
We just gotta find a way
to bring back the sun.

01:38.933 --> 01:42.562
Working on it. Failing
miserably, but working on it.

01:42.733 --> 01:46.567
I could really use some help
deciphering some of these symbols.

01:46.733 --> 01:50.043
Or all of them, really.

01:50.853 --> 01:53.447
I need Wesley.

01:54.333 --> 01:56.449
His expertise.

01:56.653 --> 01:58.803
Yeah, well, rogue warrior
took off without a word.

01:59.013 --> 02:02.244
After Electro-Gwen decided to skip
town when the going got tougher.

02:02.453 --> 02:04.330
Not big on the teamwork, either of them.

02:04.533 --> 02:06.330
You're wasting your time.

02:06.493 --> 02:08.050
"The answer is among us."

02:10.733 --> 02:13.406
He knows. He's part of the plan.

02:13.613 --> 02:16.173
- He doesn't remember.
- So he says.

02:16.333 --> 02:18.722
You saw him yourself,
making a pact with the Beast.

02:18.933 --> 02:21.401
It wasn't Angel in my
vision. It was Angelus.

02:21.613 --> 02:27.449
- He is Angelus.
- Believe me, you've never met Angelus.

02:28.853 --> 02:32.129
Me neither. But I'm starting
to think maybe it's time we did.

02:32.333 --> 02:36.121
Maybe Wes is right. Big Beastie has
got to be stopped, and I'm out of ideas.

02:36.333 --> 02:39.052
If there's a chance Angelus
has inside info we could use...

02:39.253 --> 02:41.084
You think he's going to turn it over?

02:41.293 --> 02:43.045
I think it's worth a try.

02:43.253 --> 02:47.166
Not gonna happen. The Gypsies cursed
him with a soul so he'd feel remorse...

02:47.333 --> 02:50.405
...to make him suffer for
all the people he slaughtered.

02:50.613 --> 02:55.846
Removing that soul is the only way
to change Angel back into Angelus.

02:56.053 --> 02:58.283
A lot easier said than done.

02:58.453 --> 03:00.091
-  The Gypsy curse was specific.

03:00.253 --> 03:03.484
For Angel to lose his soul, he
would have to experience a moment...

03:03.653 --> 03:07.123
...of perfect, pure happiness.

03:09.093 --> 03:14.884
And right now, happiness of any
kind is in kind of short supply.

03:15.093 --> 03:17.926
- You sure?
- Sorry, bucko, I got nothing.

03:18.133 --> 03:21.569
Your choice of "The Night the Lights
Went Out in Georgia" threw me a wee.

03:21.733 --> 03:24.122
I'm personally not huge
with the Vicky Lawrence love.

03:24.333 --> 03:27.564
Doesn't make sense. I remember
everything Angelus did, I did.

03:27.733 --> 03:31.692
Every family butchered, every child
slaughtered, every throat ripped out.

03:31.853 --> 03:34.162
I remember every detail of all of it.

03:34.373 --> 03:37.012
So how come you don't have a
smidge of any recollection...

03:37.173 --> 03:40.370
...of a giant magma demon
with ram horns and goat legs?

03:40.573 --> 03:43.883
Hey, all's I can tell you, stud, is
if it's in there, it's buried deep.

03:44.053 --> 03:45.805
Deep inside Angelus.

03:46.013 --> 03:48.481
Then that's where it stays.
Even if I wanted it...

03:48.653 --> 03:51.167
...there's no way to bring Angelus back.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:24.533 --> 04:28.924
Rumor has it you possess
certain skills I require.

04:30.453 --> 04:33.650
I need a soul extracted.

04:39.493 --> 04:41.882
Awakening

05:31.133 --> 05:33.249
- Did Lorne help you remember?
- No.

05:33.453 --> 05:35.409
- Anything at all?
- Nothing.

05:35.613 --> 05:37.843
- What've we got?
- A puzzle with missing pieces...

05:38.013 --> 05:39.446
...and some cryptic gibberish.

05:39.653 --> 05:41.484
Angel, whatever power this device had...

05:41.653 --> 05:44.565
...got swallowed up by the Beast.
It won't bring back the sun.

05:44.733 --> 05:47.042
- Without the orb, it's as useless as...
- Us.

05:47.213 --> 05:49.283
Face it, man, we're losing ground.

05:49.493 --> 05:53.042
Pretty much the only victory we can
claim is that we're not dead yet.

05:54.973 --> 06:00.331
Okay, look, I know things haven't been
going our way lately, but things change.

06:00.533 --> 06:03.570
We're not down for the count.
The Beast is not our only concern.

06:03.733 --> 06:07.248
Until we figure out how to end eternal
darkness, it's a devil's playground.

06:07.453 --> 06:09.728
Just the way you like it, huh?

06:12.053 --> 06:14.726
Something to say, Connor?

06:15.333 --> 06:17.164
You got a problem?

06:17.333 --> 06:18.846
- You.
- Hey, Connor.

06:19.013 --> 06:22.210
Acting like the big leader. Like
we don't already know what we know.

06:22.413 --> 06:24.005
And what do you know?

06:24.173 --> 06:25.970
Everybody thought it was me.

06:26.453 --> 06:28.171
-  Maybe even I was starting to.

06:28.373 --> 06:30.967
It was you. You're the one
who's working with the Beast.

06:31.133 --> 06:33.169
- I'm not.
- Well, then you're a puppet.

06:33.333 --> 06:35.801
Either way, everything's
going to hell because of you.

06:36.013 --> 06:39.005
You're the reason that the sun
is gone, that I don't have a home.

06:39.173 --> 06:40.845
You're the reason that she...

06:43.933 --> 06:46.049
It's you.

06:46.333 --> 06:48.642
You're the reason my life sucks.

06:52.933 --> 06:55.128
Get over it.

06:55.973 --> 06:59.932
Not to be a buttinsky, but could
we get back to the pep talky thing?

07:00.493 --> 07:05.248
I'm not one to turn down a little
pep, but I'd much prefer we had a plan.

07:05.413 --> 07:07.244
-  Here's one.

07:09.333 --> 07:10.971
Him.

07:11.173 --> 07:12.208
Who's he?

07:12.413 --> 07:15.530
Wo-Pang. He can deliver Angelus to us.

07:17.053 --> 07:19.886
- Thought you said...
- Me too.

07:20.053 --> 07:23.682
Fred, would you mind brewing
some tea for our guest?

07:25.213 --> 07:27.329
Sure.

07:30.453 --> 07:33.684
Right this way, Mr. Pang.

07:33.853 --> 07:36.890
Any special tea you...?

07:37.053 --> 07:39.567
How about orange zinger?

07:39.733 --> 07:41.166
Oh, okay.

07:41.333 --> 07:42.971
-  What do you mean, deliver Angelus?

07:43.133 --> 07:44.122
Wo-Pang's a shaman.

07:44.293 --> 07:45.726
Order of the
Kun-Sun-Dai.

07:45.893 --> 07:48.885
Dark mystics? You brought a dark
mystic here without talking to me?

07:49.053 --> 07:51.089
He claims he has the
power to extract souls.

07:51.253 --> 07:53.892
- Claims?
- More importantly, he can restore them.

07:54.053 --> 07:56.362
Once we learn what Angelus
knows about the Beast...

07:56.573 --> 07:58.564
We're not bringing Angelus.

07:58.733 --> 08:00.769
- You don't have a choice.
- I do. That was it.

08:00.933 --> 08:04.562
- Wanna hear it again? Not bringing.
- Don't make it harder than it has to be.

08:04.773 --> 08:08.402
There's no plan B, and we're running out
of time. People are in serious danger.

08:08.573 --> 08:11.645
Then unleashing Angelus is the
last thing that we should do.

08:11.853 --> 08:13.969
If he's here, I'm not.

08:14.133 --> 08:17.409
I won't be able to protect
anyone from the Beast, or from me.

08:18.133 --> 08:20.044
It's only temporary.

08:20.253 --> 08:23.962
We'll take all the necessary
precautions in the interim, contain you.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.172
I'm not blind to the risks.

08:27.333 --> 08:29.893
- I know what Angelus...
- You have no idea...

08:30.053 --> 08:32.044
...what Angelus is, Wesley.

08:32.253 --> 08:34.767
All you know is what
you've read in books.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.089
You've never had the
pleasure of his company.

08:37.253 --> 08:39.244
And you're not going to.

08:39.453 --> 08:41.921
Get rid of the shaman.

09:05.453 --> 09:08.092
They're all going to die.

09:08.293 --> 09:10.648
The flowers...

09:11.933 --> 09:15.403
...plants, trees...

09:15.613 --> 09:17.649
...without sun.

09:21.453 --> 09:24.047
Just realizing.

09:30.253 --> 09:33.848
I just came to say...

09:34.053 --> 09:35.725
...that I'm on your side.

09:36.453 --> 09:40.162
Angelus is the jumbo
family-size bad of bad ideas.

09:40.373 --> 09:43.365
He'd be a danger to all of
us. You made the right call.

09:43.533 --> 09:47.446
Wesley, the others, they don't get it.

09:48.133 --> 09:50.328
But you do.

09:50.733 --> 09:54.567
Well, if I didn't when Angelus was
loose and killing in Sunnydale...

09:54.733 --> 09:58.282
...then reliving his past horrors in
virtual, wide-screen Sensurround...

09:58.453 --> 10:01.889
...during my tenure in floaty-ville
pretty much makes me an expert.

10:02.093 --> 10:03.924
Right.

10:08.533 --> 10:11.570
Do you...? Do you think Connor's right?

10:11.733 --> 10:15.089
That I'm being used by the
Beast without even knowing?

10:15.253 --> 10:16.971
No.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.763
Are you just saying that?

10:19.933 --> 10:23.243
Yes. I don't know, Angel. It's possible.

10:23.413 --> 10:26.485
Well, if I am, then I'm already
a danger to you. All of you.

10:26.653 --> 10:31.283
Well, not like Angelus
would be. I mean, he's...

10:31.453 --> 10:33.205
He's smart.

10:33.933 --> 10:36.128
Excuse me?

10:36.453 --> 10:39.365
Well, you know what I mean.

10:39.573 --> 10:42.645
- You're saying Angelus is smarter.
- No. I mean...

10:43.773 --> 10:45.729
...you're smart.

10:45.933 --> 10:47.252
He's just...

10:47.853 --> 10:50.492
- Ingenious.
- But in that twisted, sadistic...

10:50.653 --> 10:53.087
...ruthless kind of way.
- Like the Beast.

10:53.293 --> 10:57.332
Yes, exactly. They think alike.
Always a step or two ahead of us.

10:57.653 --> 11:01.566
I mean, what is it about evil
that jacks up the IQ points?

11:01.733 --> 11:03.530
It's like whenever...

11:04.853 --> 11:06.650
What?

11:08.973 --> 11:11.168
Angel?

11:12.253 --> 11:13.572
We're gonna need a cage.

11:13.733 --> 11:15.485
-  A cage?
- A strong one, 10 by 12...

11:15.653 --> 11:19.487
...steel-reinforced,
2-inch bars, maybe 3.

11:19.653 --> 11:22.042
-  I'll make some calls.

11:24.333 --> 11:26.608
He thinks something like
that will hold the Beast?

11:26.773 --> 11:28.889
It's not for the Beast.

11:29.053 --> 11:31.248
It's for him.

11:44.653 --> 11:46.723
That's it then.

11:55.053 --> 11:57.442
- You got it?
- Yeah.

12:11.053 --> 12:12.964
The cage is solid, man.

12:13.133 --> 12:16.921
All right, tell the shaman we're ready.

12:17.453 --> 12:20.968
Hey, listen, Angel-cakes, if
it's all the same with you...

12:21.133 --> 12:23.283
...I think I might sit
this one out upstairs.

12:23.453 --> 12:27.287
You know how dark magic unleashing
unspeakable evil gives me the heebies.

12:27.453 --> 12:30.684
It's okay. Tell Cordy and Fred they
don't need to be down here either.

12:30.853 --> 12:34.084
Gotcha, chief. Break a leg.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.971
-  Connor.

12:36.133 --> 12:37.327
What?

12:37.853 --> 12:41.687
Look, I know you like to
think that I'm the enemy.

12:42.533 --> 12:47.243
But if this works, I will be.

12:47.933 --> 12:51.528
-  I'm gonna become the one thing
you were raised to believe I was.

12:51.733 --> 12:55.248
The thing I never,
never wanted you to see.

12:55.853 --> 12:58.925
Yeah. I think I can handle it.

12:59.093 --> 13:00.082
Uh-huh.

13:00.253 --> 13:03.563
Well, just keep in mind
that whatever Angelus says...

13:03.733 --> 13:07.089
...whatever he does, remember...

13:07.253 --> 13:09.289
...he's not your father.

13:09.453 --> 13:10.886
I am.

13:11.653 --> 13:14.451
-  No matter what happens...

13:17.053 --> 13:19.248
...or happened...

13:21.333 --> 13:22.925
...I love you.

13:31.133 --> 13:32.612
Look, one more thing.

13:32.773 --> 13:36.561
Since I'm gonna be out of commission
for a while, I want you to, you know...

13:36.733 --> 13:40.009
...take care of
everybody, keep them safe.

13:40.213 --> 13:43.444
That means if anything should
go wrong with Angelus...

13:44.533 --> 13:47.047
...you're gonna have to kill me.
- Okay.

13:47.253 --> 13:49.687
If anything goes wrong.

13:49.853 --> 13:51.684
Right. I got it.

14:08.253 --> 14:09.925
- What is that? -
It is the Muo-ping.

14:10.133 --> 14:12.522
The receptacle that will house his soul.

14:12.733 --> 14:14.212
Cordy, I don't want you here.

14:14.373 --> 14:17.092
Yeah? Tough.

14:30.333 --> 14:34.121
- It would be wise for your safety
to add a second lock to the door.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.971
Do as he says.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.123
Angel...

14:49.693 --> 14:51.649
...you don't have to do this.

14:52.133 --> 14:53.885
Now she tells me.

14:54.053 --> 14:57.807
Close your eyes and don't speak.

15:24.453 --> 15:27.729
Time to say goodbye.

15:34.573 --> 15:36.086
Gunn!

15:36.293 --> 15:38.761
-  Hurry!
- Fool! Why would I help you?

15:38.933 --> 15:40.366
I serve the Awakened One.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.131
Little help here, please.

16:02.053 --> 16:06.649
So this was all a setup, this
whole soul colonic thing. For what?

16:07.493 --> 16:09.563
That's what I'd like to know.

16:11.133 --> 16:13.886
-  Why does the Beast
suddenly want me dead?

16:14.053 --> 16:17.841
Did Angelus welsh on
our pact? Is that it?

16:18.453 --> 16:23.481
Okay, then maybe you can shed a little
light as to what the Beast's plan is.

16:25.533 --> 16:29.321
Or maybe I should just start
taking you apart now, piece...

16:34.893 --> 16:36.724
...by piece.

16:37.133 --> 16:40.523
Well, so much for that
font of information.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.930
Gunn, see if he has anything on him.

16:54.653 --> 16:57.087
He's got something on him, all right.

17:01.213 --> 17:04.569
-  Is there any part of this guy
that doesn't have writing all over it?

17:04.772 --> 17:06.286
Scratch that. I don't wanna know.

17:06.453 --> 17:09.729
- Can you translate it?
- Most of it. Definitely scripture.

17:10.653 --> 17:15.124
A recorded history of the Kun-Sun-Dai.
They're acolytes of the Beast, all right.

17:15.292 --> 17:16.612
-  That's why we couldn't find...

17:16.772 --> 17:18.729
...anything written about
Beastie Boy in the books.

17:18.933 --> 17:20.366
They have it on their asses.

17:20.532 --> 17:22.251
-  Hang on.
- What is it?

17:22.853 --> 17:24.923
-  There's a passage here.

17:25.133 --> 17:27.044
- Difficult to... Fred, could you...?
- Oh.

17:27.413 --> 17:28.402
Uh-huh.

17:28.573 --> 17:33.966
It's detailing the acolytes' victory
over the Bosh M'ad sometime in...

17:34.133 --> 17:35.452
I think in the third century.

17:35.613 --> 17:38.685
What's Bosh... Whatever you said?

17:38.853 --> 17:40.809
The Opposers of the Awakening.

17:41.013 --> 17:44.289
The Bosh M'ad forged
something to destroy the Beast.

17:44.493 --> 17:47.769
-  The tooth of light.
- They made a tooth?

17:47.933 --> 17:50.493
To the best of my interpretation,
a weapon of some kind.

17:50.693 --> 17:52.411
How'd it work out for them?

17:53.733 --> 17:56.691
It was never used. The
Awakening was centuries away.

17:56.893 --> 17:59.566
In the meantime, every
last one of the Bosh M'ad...

17:59.733 --> 18:02.088
...was wiped out by
the Beast's acolytes.

18:02.253 --> 18:05.768
So this tooth thing must
have had them worried.

18:05.933 --> 18:07.286
What happened to it?

18:07.493 --> 18:08.687
Never found.

18:08.853 --> 18:10.730
The Opposers kept it hidden.

18:10.933 --> 18:13.049
So now we have to find
a tooth in a haystack.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.210
We don't even know what the weapon is.

18:17.133 --> 18:19.283
It's a sword.

18:19.493 --> 18:21.370
The sword of Bosh M'ad.

18:21.733 --> 18:23.086
-  I can see it.

18:23.453 --> 18:25.648
Pretty.

18:27.933 --> 18:29.207
I know where it is.

18:29.413 --> 18:31.768
- Where?
- It's here, under the city.

18:31.933 --> 18:33.446
Well, that's a break.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.331
Did you hear that? There's a sword.

18:35.533 --> 18:36.966
-  A sword to kill the Beast.

18:37.173 --> 18:41.086
You wanted to turn me into Angelus by
having an evil shaman cut off my head.

18:41.253 --> 18:43.642
Not that that wasn't a swell plan too.

18:45.933 --> 18:47.730
Sorry.

18:52.853 --> 18:55.731
Was that an apology?

18:58.933 --> 19:00.571
I was careless.

19:00.733 --> 19:04.123
Made a mistake that
almost cost you your life.

19:05.733 --> 19:08.566
Would've made pulling you out
of the ocean a waste of my time.

19:08.853 --> 19:11.925
Yeah, that would've been a drag.

19:13.053 --> 19:16.762
It's just the first time I
ever heard you apologize...

19:16.933 --> 19:19.242
...about anything.

19:22.773 --> 19:26.129
So we gonna go get the sword, or what?

19:33.053 --> 19:34.771
-  I don't get this.
-  What?

19:34.933 --> 19:38.687
How is it a sword from the third
century is conveniently located...

19:38.853 --> 19:40.764
...here in Los Angeles?

19:40.933 --> 19:43.163
I don't think it is.

19:43.333 --> 19:47.565
I mean, I get the impression
that somehow it's accessible...

19:47.733 --> 19:50.884
...from, like, 100
points all over the world.

19:51.053 --> 19:52.566
How's that work?

19:52.733 --> 19:56.203
I don't know. I just get the
visions, not the Cliff Notes.

19:57.053 --> 20:00.250
Over there. What's that?

20:05.933 --> 20:08.049
The way down.

20:09.333 --> 20:13.087
That's a steep grade down there.
Gonna have to take it a little slow.

20:13.253 --> 20:15.369
Watch our steps and stay...

20:15.533 --> 20:17.444
...together.

20:23.853 --> 20:24.842
Oh.

20:25.253 --> 20:27.608
- Connor.
- Found something.

20:31.533 --> 20:35.128
Easy, easy.

20:35.973 --> 20:41.047
What are those? Holiday decorations
left over from some S & M bondage party?

20:47.733 --> 20:50.167
Wood. Why did it have to be wood?

20:50.373 --> 20:53.888
We have to pass through the corridor
without ringing any of the bells.

20:55.733 --> 20:58.486
I knew you two would get
me in trouble some day.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.451
Cordelia, freeze!

21:36.133 --> 21:37.691
Your sleeve.

22:24.133 --> 22:26.601
- Oh, no.
- It's a dead end.

22:26.773 --> 22:29.082
Who booby-traps a dead
end? That's just not right.

22:29.293 --> 22:31.648
There's something here.

22:33.013 --> 22:36.130
- Assyrian?
- Hebrew.

22:36.653 --> 22:38.086
Rashi script.

22:38.253 --> 22:39.481
Can you read it?

22:39.653 --> 22:42.645
Well, they're just random
letters, one on each stone.

22:42.853 --> 22:45.128
Unless...

22:49.933 --> 22:51.764
This is it! You did...

22:53.173 --> 22:55.289
- You didn't.
- There's a pattern.

22:55.453 --> 22:58.889
Hebrew letters have numerical
values. Aleph is one.

22:59.053 --> 23:03.092
The letter with the next highest
numerical value would be he.

23:03.253 --> 23:05.483
Five.

23:06.453 --> 23:08.603
- What happened? What happened?
- He was wrong.

23:08.813 --> 23:11.646
I don't know. I don't know what else...

23:12.533 --> 23:13.852
Nine stones.

23:14.053 --> 23:16.692
Yes, that's it. It's not
their numerical value.

23:16.853 --> 23:20.687
These are the first letters of the
nine antediluvian patriarchs in Genesis.

23:20.853 --> 23:22.366
That would've been my next guess.

23:22.573 --> 23:24.484
- So which one do we press?
- Aleph was Adam.

23:24.653 --> 23:28.009
So in ascending order, shin for Seth.

23:28.213 --> 23:30.124
That one.

23:35.133 --> 23:37.089
- Now what?
- Kaph for Cainan.

23:37.253 --> 23:38.402
Which one's kaph?

23:39.253 --> 23:40.811
- Maybe that one.
-  Maybe?

23:41.013 --> 23:43.846
I don't have enough shirt
to bandage both of you.

23:49.133 --> 23:50.566
Come on!

23:51.413 --> 23:52.641
Connor, go.

23:52.813 --> 23:54.485
Both of us.

23:54.653 --> 23:56.723
Now.

23:59.973 --> 24:01.167
Which way now?

24:01.533 --> 24:04.252
- Don't look at me.
- We should split up.

24:04.413 --> 24:06.881
Connor, go with Wes. Cordy
and I'll go to the left.

24:07.053 --> 24:08.406
- I'll go with Cordy.
- Connor...

24:08.613 --> 24:12.322
- What difference does it make?
- We don't have time for a discussion.

24:13.053 --> 24:15.203
Just go with Wesley.

24:21.133 --> 24:26.491
I'm sorry about that back there. Connor.

24:26.653 --> 24:28.962
He's still confused about things.

24:29.133 --> 24:33.046
I've really made a mess of
a messy situation, haven't I?

24:34.453 --> 24:38.048
Some really rotten decisions
I'd love to take back.

24:38.253 --> 24:39.606
But...

24:41.573 --> 24:44.883
But I don't know if you ever could...

24:45.053 --> 24:46.566
Could?

24:46.733 --> 24:47.722
Whoa.

24:50.133 --> 24:53.045
Could what? What could I ever...?

24:58.053 --> 25:00.851
This has gotta be the place.

25:03.453 --> 25:04.681
So where's the sword?

25:05.533 --> 25:07.569
-  Okay, great.

25:07.733 --> 25:09.803
- It's gone.
- Maybe.

25:09.973 --> 25:12.282
What maybe? I don't see it. Do you?

25:12.453 --> 25:14.569
No.

25:14.733 --> 25:17.452
The light must be coming from somewhere.

25:22.333 --> 25:24.563
Angel.

25:25.933 --> 25:29.562
It's some kind of dimensional hub.

25:29.733 --> 25:32.327
That's why the sword
can be in 100 places...

25:34.133 --> 25:36.522
...at once.

25:43.133 --> 25:45.806
I'd say things are starting to look...

25:46.013 --> 25:47.765
Angel.

25:54.173 --> 25:57.051
Can we get out of here now?

25:57.613 --> 25:58.887
-  Cordy!

25:59.733 --> 26:01.769
Angel!

26:12.053 --> 26:13.202
-  Angel!

26:13.373 --> 26:14.442
-  Hang on!

26:25.653 --> 26:26.642
Uhh.

26:30.973 --> 26:31.962
Uhh. Uhh.

26:33.733 --> 26:35.689
Oh, my God. Are you...?

26:35.893 --> 26:37.246
No, no. No, no, I'm good.

26:37.413 --> 26:38.402
Uh.

26:40.653 --> 26:43.725
I'm good. See?

26:47.173 --> 26:49.528
I missed the pointy end.

26:50.853 --> 26:52.844
What?

26:57.773 --> 26:59.650
We could have died.

27:00.333 --> 27:02.403
But we didn't.

27:02.613 --> 27:04.365
What if we had?

27:04.573 --> 27:09.169
What if we'd been deep-fried trying
to save the world again and...

27:10.653 --> 27:11.642
And I...

27:12.253 --> 27:15.643
...didn't have the chance to tell you.

27:16.733 --> 27:19.042
Tell me what?

27:21.253 --> 27:24.563
I'm sorry for what happened.

27:24.733 --> 27:26.963
For what I let happen with Connor.

27:27.173 --> 27:30.563
I was lost and frightened.

27:30.733 --> 27:35.727
I thought it was the end,
and I wanted to be with you.

27:35.933 --> 27:38.242
But I couldn't.

27:39.133 --> 27:41.772
Oh, God, to do what I did.

27:41.933 --> 27:43.924
-  It's gonna be all right.

27:44.253 --> 27:46.448
-  No.

27:47.853 --> 27:51.971
You need to know that I can look
back and see every horrible thing...

27:52.133 --> 27:56.092
...you've ever done as Angelus,
and it doesn't matter anymore...

27:56.253 --> 28:00.849
...because when I'm with you, all I
feel is the good you've done as Angel.

28:01.733 --> 28:03.849
I know I've hurt you.

28:04.333 --> 28:08.929
I know I don't deserve forgiveness.

28:12.733 --> 28:15.042
Cordy...

28:16.133 --> 28:19.648
...I don't care what you've
done in your past either.

28:26.533 --> 28:29.764
I don't know if this is right, Angel.

28:29.933 --> 28:31.161
Stop talking.

28:31.333 --> 28:33.927
Okay.

28:49.733 --> 28:51.291
Connor.

28:52.933 --> 28:55.652
-  Connor! Connor, wait.

29:05.453 --> 29:06.886
-  Connor...
- Leave me alone.

29:07.053 --> 29:09.328
Can't we just talk about this?

29:10.213 --> 29:12.124
Don't move.

29:13.173 --> 29:15.448
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Connor!

29:15.853 --> 29:17.127
Ow.

29:19.053 --> 29:20.088
That hurt.

29:20.293 --> 29:23.012
Yeah. I can really
see why she wants you.

29:23.213 --> 29:24.441
Connor, I know you're hurt.

29:24.613 --> 29:28.401
You don't know anything, Dad, except
how to take things away from me.

29:29.773 --> 29:31.172
Be careful.

29:31.373 --> 29:34.251
Why? Nothing in this world is
the way it ought to be, right?

29:34.453 --> 29:36.205
It's harsh and cruel.

29:39.493 --> 29:40.846
Because of you!

29:46.133 --> 29:48.010
This isn't the place for this.

29:56.453 --> 29:58.728
It's your fault. It's all your fault.

30:00.053 --> 30:02.487
- I shouldn't have been born!
- Grow up!

30:03.053 --> 30:05.487
You think you're the only
one who ever felt like that?

30:05.653 --> 30:08.486
- Wished his father were dead?
- Yeah, but mine already is.

30:13.573 --> 30:15.848
It's not all about you, Connor.

30:16.053 --> 30:18.123
What you want isn't
always what people need.

30:18.333 --> 30:20.483
She was mine!

30:23.933 --> 30:25.082
She was mine.

30:25.253 --> 30:27.528
No, she wasn't.

30:30.253 --> 30:34.087
I'm sorry, Connor, but you
need to understand that.

30:37.453 --> 30:39.444
Connor.

30:56.933 --> 30:58.252
-  Oh, my God.

30:58.533 --> 31:02.242
- Thought you guys might be dead.
- Don't stop thinking it yet.

31:03.333 --> 31:06.962
- Is that it?
- The sword of the Bosh M'ad.

31:07.133 --> 31:09.886
The slayer of the Beast.

31:10.093 --> 31:11.970
Can I play with it?

31:14.253 --> 31:16.562
Where's Connor?

31:17.573 --> 31:19.131
Patrolling.

31:20.933 --> 31:21.922
-  We have the sword.

31:22.293 --> 31:23.282
-  Now all we need is...

31:26.533 --> 31:28.091
My bad.

31:29.653 --> 31:31.962
All we need to do is locate the Beast.

31:32.133 --> 31:34.931
Well, most of my connections
have am-scrayed to dimensions...

31:35.093 --> 31:37.527
...a little lighter on the
stomping your entrails out.

31:37.733 --> 31:40.122
All I could Kolchak was a
rumor of bad mojo rising...

31:40.293 --> 31:42.887
...in the warehouse district.
- That's where we'll start.

31:43.053 --> 31:46.568
Wait. We found some relevant
passages in the Paranych Grimore...

31:46.733 --> 31:50.965
...which we were able to
cross-reference with Wo-Pang's butt.

31:51.133 --> 31:55.365
Either he's got one hell of a funky mole,
or there's only one way to kill the Beast.

31:55.573 --> 31:58.371
- How?
- Piercing its brain with the Bosh M'ad.

31:58.733 --> 32:01.042
- Sounds like a plan to me.
- And what about the sun?

32:01.213 --> 32:03.852
One good poke in the coconut
should take care of that too.

32:04.013 --> 32:08.848
When the Beast is dead, the energy used
to block the sun should be released.

32:09.333 --> 32:10.732
There's a catch, isn't there?

32:10.933 --> 32:12.810
One small eensie.

32:13.013 --> 32:14.332
Always with the fine print.

32:14.533 --> 32:18.128
Took a whole lot of power to
pull off permanent midnight.

32:21.733 --> 32:26.045
Which will all be released
when I kill the Beast.

32:26.253 --> 32:28.164
As far as we can figure from the text...

32:28.373 --> 32:32.286
...nothing human will
survive at that close a range.

32:33.053 --> 32:36.045
I'm not even sure that you can.

32:38.533 --> 32:39.932
I'll let you know.

32:40.093 --> 32:41.924
-  You won't fight
this thing by yourself.

32:42.133 --> 32:43.202
There's no choice.

32:43.453 --> 32:45.045
There's always a choice.

32:45.253 --> 32:47.005
Not for me.

32:47.213 --> 32:48.771
-  I have to do this.

32:49.533 --> 32:51.569
You've made a difference.

32:51.733 --> 32:52.882
Each of you.

32:53.253 --> 32:55.608
Not just to me, but to the world.

32:56.253 --> 32:58.323
-  We've been pushed to
the edge so many times...

32:58.533 --> 33:01.172
...done things we were sure
could never be forgiven.

33:02.133 --> 33:05.443
-  But we're always there
for each other when it counts.

33:05.653 --> 33:07.689
We've never let the darkness win.

33:08.053 --> 33:11.966
-  And it's not because of the Powers
That Be or the super strength...

33:12.133 --> 33:14.010
...or the magical weapons.

33:14.333 --> 33:16.369
It's because we believe in each other.

33:16.533 --> 33:19.764
Not just as friends or lovers...

33:19.933 --> 33:22.493
...but as champions.

33:22.653 --> 33:26.851
All of us, together.

33:29.733 --> 33:31.928
Angel, wait.

33:32.253 --> 33:34.562
You just said it.

33:34.733 --> 33:36.291
We're stronger together.

33:36.493 --> 33:38.563
You can't do this alone.

33:38.733 --> 33:39.768
I'm not.

33:39.973 --> 33:41.326
Drop the Hallmark crap.

33:41.533 --> 33:43.285
That might placate the shiny happys...

33:43.493 --> 33:46.644
...but I'm working with
a little more investment.

33:47.293 --> 33:49.284
I can't lose you.

33:49.653 --> 33:51.530
Not now.

33:51.733 --> 33:54.645
Not when we're just starting...

33:55.933 --> 33:58.572
...whatever it is or could be.

33:58.773 --> 34:00.889
We'll figure it out when I get back.

34:01.053 --> 34:02.566
But what if you don't?

34:02.733 --> 34:05.247
It's not gonna happen.

34:05.933 --> 34:07.366
You don't know that.

34:07.533 --> 34:11.286
Hey, I've never been
more sure of anything.

34:11.453 --> 34:15.571
I'll come back, Cordelia...

34:15.733 --> 34:18.371
...I promise, for you.

34:18.533 --> 34:21.684
But first, I gotta do this.
I gotta find the Beast and...

34:26.693 --> 34:27.681
Oh.

34:27.853 --> 34:29.411
There he is.

34:34.693 --> 34:37.685
I grow weary of your cowardice, Angelus.

34:38.132 --> 34:42.603
If you will not stand with me,
then suffer the agony of my wrath.

34:42.813 --> 34:44.405
Is that what I think it is?

34:44.612 --> 34:45.931
Go.

34:50.333 --> 34:52.688
- No! Get out of here!
- No!

34:52.893 --> 34:55.453
-  All of you! I can't
do this with you here. Go!

34:58.613 --> 35:00.729
No! Angel!

35:01.733 --> 35:04.725
- That stings.
- Not as much as it's gonna.

35:04.933 --> 35:07.401
We could rule this world.
Why do you oppose me?

35:07.613 --> 35:12.289
Rain of fire, blocking out the sun,
and you just kind of piss me off.

35:18.773 --> 35:20.889
It doesn't have to be this way, Angelus.

35:21.093 --> 35:23.084
I'm thinking it does.

35:40.453 --> 35:43.365
Did you really think you'd win?

35:48.253 --> 35:51.051
The boy joins the father in death.

35:51.253 --> 35:53.926
No, in kicking your stony ass.

36:07.253 --> 36:08.891
Such arrogance.

36:10.493 --> 36:13.724
So much like Angelus.

36:14.053 --> 36:17.204
His name is Angel.

36:19.493 --> 36:21.290
Consider your ass kicked.

36:35.253 --> 36:37.130
-  Dad.

36:38.813 --> 36:39.962
You came back.

36:40.133 --> 36:43.842
Like I'd let you take all the
credit for saving the world?

36:45.653 --> 36:47.723
-  You're right.

36:48.333 --> 36:51.928
It is harsh and cruel.

36:52.333 --> 36:55.643
She was the only thing
that made it hurt less.

36:56.533 --> 36:59.570
- Connor...
- But it's not me.

36:59.733 --> 37:01.724
I could feel it in her touch.

37:02.133 --> 37:04.488
In her eyes.

37:05.733 --> 37:08.122
She loves you.

37:09.533 --> 37:12.047
It's always been you.

37:13.253 --> 37:14.925
I'm sorry.

37:16.453 --> 37:19.445
She was too old for me anyway.

37:20.733 --> 37:23.247
Is this what it feels like?

37:23.653 --> 37:25.803
Being a champion?

37:27.333 --> 37:29.528
Pretty much.

37:33.653 --> 37:35.848
Connor?

37:38.453 --> 37:40.569
-  Oh, my God.

37:42.053 --> 37:44.965
- You did it.
- We did it.

37:48.453 --> 37:50.011
All of us.

37:55.733 --> 37:56.722
Ohh.

37:57.933 --> 38:00.367
Now, could one of you do me a favor...

38:00.533 --> 38:04.651
...and sweep that up?

38:33.533 --> 38:39.449
Must be hard, seeing everyone
so happy because of what you did.

38:40.133 --> 38:42.852
Bringing the light back...

38:43.933 --> 38:47.323
...but not being able to go out into it.

38:49.333 --> 38:52.564
There's no place I'd rather be...

39:00.053 --> 39:02.521
...than here with you.

39:27.693 --> 39:30.651
- Cordy.
- No.

39:31.253 --> 39:33.562
Whatever it is...

39:33.733 --> 39:39.444
...whatever the reason
or excuse or logic...

39:39.853 --> 39:45.962
...we're here now, together.

39:46.133 --> 39:51.730
Everything is the way it's
supposed to be for once.

39:53.333 --> 39:55.722
Angel...

39:56.053 --> 39:58.567
...haven't we waited long enough?

40:41.133 --> 40:42.452
Ah.

41:03.853 --> 41:07.641
Buffy? No! Oh, God, no!

41:13.733 --> 41:16.566
Illusion becomes reality.

41:18.933 --> 41:21.128
It is done.

41:32.053 --> 41:34.567
Angelus.
