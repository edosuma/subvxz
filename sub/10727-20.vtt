And, you...

09:39.630 --> 09:41.764
you're going to pay for this.

09:41.766 --> 09:42.832
Me?!

09:42.834 --> 09:45.334
It was<i> your</i> idea!

09:45.336 --> 09:47.369
Oh...yeah.

09:47.371 --> 09:50.673
And that's why I'm gonna
let you go this one time.

09:50.675 --> 09:53.209
'Cause I got a good team here.

09:53.211 --> 09:56.445
And when we get mad,
we aren't very cute.

09:56.447 --> 09:57.680
Oh, okay.

09:57.682 --> 09:59.515
Mojo is on his way.

09:59.517 --> 10:00.549
Come on, girl.

[ Trumpets softly ]

10:01.886 --> 10:03.385
I'm sorry, guys.

10:03.387 --> 10:06.222
I had no idea
I'd let my identity

10:06.224 --> 10:08.858
become so defined
by being cute.

10:08.860 --> 10:11.126
Yeah.
Talk about limiting yourself.

10:11.128 --> 10:14.330
Under the surface,
you're, like, terrifying!

10:14.332 --> 10:16.899
So much better
than being cute.

10:16.901 --> 10:20.035
Yep, I think
we all learned a lot today!

10:20.037 --> 10:21.370
Not you again!

10:21.372 --> 10:22.805
You know it!

10:22.807 --> 10:24.240
I'm back in the photo game

10:24.242 --> 10:27.643
after that salon got
a restraining order against me.

10:27.645 --> 10:30.613
Hey, can I get a shot
for the<i> Townsville Daily?</i>

10:32.416 --> 10:34.516
Yes! Yes, you can.

10:34.518 --> 10:40.289
Okay. Everyone say, "Break me
off a slice of that funk pie!"

10:43.027 --> 10:44.927
You really want to
hang<i> that</i> one up?

10:44.929 --> 10:47.096
Yeah.
I look so happy.

10:47.098 --> 10:51.267
Plus, I'm with my favorite
people in the whole wide world!

10:51.269 --> 10:53.936
Wow, you really learned
a lot from all this, Bubbles.

10:53.938 --> 10:55.938
Yep, most importantly,

10:55.940 --> 10:58.540

as ugly as Mojo.
