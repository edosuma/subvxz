00:34.826 --> 00:36.870
- Afternoon, ladies.
- Morning.

00:39.581 --> 00:42.417
Excuse me,
we're looking for a Doris Laird?

00:42.500 --> 00:43.334
Uh, Mama D?

00:43.418 --> 00:46.337
Yeah, she's in her, uh, office.
It's the kitchen.

00:46.838 --> 00:49.382
- You want me to show you?
- Nope. We're good.

00:55.096 --> 00:55.930
Ms. Laird?

00:56.014 --> 00:58.016
Oh, good, you found me.

00:58.767 --> 01:02.270
Uh, sorry. I thought I'd get this finished
before you got here.

01:02.353 --> 01:03.938
Oh, no sweat. Keep at it.

01:05.022 --> 01:06.941
You're a brave woman living
in a frat house.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.443
Oh, I don't live here.

01:08.526 --> 01:11.237
I just take care of the place
and the boys.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.532
My friends think I'm out of my mind,
but I love it.

01:14.949 --> 01:15.950
Been here a while?

01:16.284 --> 01:17.284
Five years.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.607
You know, after my husband died,

01:18.661 --> 01:23.041
I realized if I didn't find a new routine,
you know, one with people in it...

01:24.125 --> 01:26.586
Well, it sounds like you got that,
and then some.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.047
They're not as bad as you think.

01:29.380 --> 01:32.217
You know, they smell and they're loud,

01:32.300 --> 01:34.844
but they treat me like
their favorite grandmother.

01:35.303 --> 01:37.263
And, uh, after the incident,

01:37.931 --> 01:40.558
well, one of them still walks me
to the car every night.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.560
- Nice.
- It is.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.438
Anyway.

01:50.276 --> 01:53.613
As I said on the phone, Detective Duvall
and I have read your case file.

01:53.696 --> 01:56.658
We're both caught up on the details
of your assault, so...

01:57.117 --> 02:00.370
- there's no reason to repeat any of that.
- Uh, thank you.

02:01.371 --> 02:07.418
I'm just wondering, is there anything else
you remember about the assault...

02:07.502 --> 02:09.545
<i>...or the suspect</i>

02:09.878 --> 02:12.549
that for any reason,

02:13.508 --> 02:15.093
you didn't mention at the time?

02:16.177 --> 02:18.263
Maybe some detail
that's come back to you since.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.225
Memories come back in bits and pieces.

02:25.812 --> 02:29.691
The truth is, I...
I try very hard not to think about it.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.651
I understand that.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.113
I guess,

02:37.031 --> 02:39.534
the one thing that does come up for me,

02:39.951 --> 02:42.391
not the only thing, but in there
with everything else, is I...

02:44.414 --> 02:47.083
I think about his manner.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.836
- How do you mean?
- Well...

02:51.504 --> 02:53.965
in some moments, he was actually, uh...

02:57.051 --> 02:58.094
<i>gentle.</i>

03:00.180 --> 03:01.973
Uh, I know, that sounds...

03:02.724 --> 03:06.477
No, actually, one of the other victims
said something similar.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.188
Oh.

03:10.773 --> 03:12.358
Well, that makes me feel, uh...

03:13.860 --> 03:15.236
I guess, less...

03:17.197 --> 03:18.197
I don't know.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.328
Did she talk to him?

03:24.579 --> 03:26.456
- She did.
- Yeah, I did too.

03:27.290 --> 03:31.419
He said he'd had the urge
for as long as he could remember.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.964
And he tried to fight for as long
as he could,

03:35.048 --> 03:37.133
but then one day, he just...

03:38.718 --> 03:39.719
gave in.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.642
I'm impressed you were able to carry on
a conversation.

03:46.809 --> 03:49.103
My husband used to say, "Dodo,

03:49.646 --> 03:51.856
you don't always
have to talk to everyone."

03:56.402 --> 03:59.822
There was one moment when I couldn't
say a thing.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.825
<i>Thought he was gonna drown me.</i>

04:11.292 --> 04:14.545
But all he did was make me wash.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.991
Pass that one off to Ingram,
I'm not gonna get to it today.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.534
Yeah, he's up to speed.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.123
Then there's the B&E from last week,
the store on 76th,

04:50.206 --> 04:51.499
he needs to go over that too.

04:52.917 --> 04:53.917
Okay, thanks.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.673
What are you doing over there?
Playing Tetris?

04:59.382 --> 05:01.634
Yeah. I'm, uh, playing Tetris.

05:01.718 --> 05:05.346
'Cause that's the kind of time I have
in my life.

05:06.806 --> 05:07.806
Detectives?

05:08.891 --> 05:10.810
Special Agent Billy Taggart. Come on back.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.607
Okay, so what's the story here?

05:16.816 --> 05:18.901
This an arranged marriage?

05:19.694 --> 05:21.195
Chief forcing the Feds on you?

05:21.696 --> 05:24.615
Agent Taggart, if I didn't want
to be here, I wouldn't be.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.743
Engaging the FBI was our idea.

05:28.619 --> 05:30.371
All right, tell me how I can help.

05:30.455 --> 05:34.625
Most immediately, we need you
to expedite a Y-STR analysis.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.389
- We have two matching samples.
- Yeah, I saw that in the case file.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.881
Well, now we have a third we need to test.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.174
There's another victim.

05:41.257 --> 05:44.177
They pulled some cells off a snow globe
in her bedroom.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.472
Get me the sample.
I can authorize them to do it in 48 hours.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.307
That'd be great. Thank you.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.599
What else?

05:51.142 --> 05:53.019
How is ViCAP for finding serialists?

05:53.311 --> 05:56.064
If the investigator's thorough
and motivated, data set's great.

05:56.147 --> 05:58.816
And safe to assume investigators are more
thorough and motivated

05:58.900 --> 06:00.360
with murders than with rapes.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.069
Pretty safe, yeah.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.299
Don't look like you just robbed us
of our innocence, Taggart.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.784
- We've been down this block before.
- We live on this block.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.453
Okay, so imperfect system.

06:10.870 --> 06:14.290
Plus, ViCAP's best when your perpetrator
has behavior that's unique.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.001
Your guy, just garden-variety horrible.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.463
His victims are all over the map,
old, young, different races...

06:20.797 --> 06:23.484
- So, he doesn't have a type.
- Sure, he does - women who live alone.

06:23.508 --> 06:25.802
That's not gonna narrow things down
on ViCAP.

06:27.261 --> 06:28.930
I'm not saying don't use it. Do.

06:29.013 --> 06:30.598
Just set some time aside.

06:30.681 --> 06:32.868
You're gonna get a lot of hits.
Don't get your hopes up.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.769
Expectations managed. Thank you.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.480
Okay, so what else?

06:39.148 --> 06:41.234
What's not in these files
I should know about?

06:43.569 --> 06:44.569
Nothing.

06:45.154 --> 06:46.154
That's it.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.991
Come on, you're smart cops.
You must have a hunch or two.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.767
Maybe the evidence isn't there yet.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.370
You don't want to go out on a limb.

06:53.913 --> 06:57.542
I'm like ViCAP. The data I generate
is only as good as the data I receive.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.132
That's a sexy description of yourself,
Taggart.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.963
You use that in your dating profile?

07:02.380 --> 07:03.380
Okay.

07:04.424 --> 07:07.635
Slow courtship it is. So, maybe instead,
I'll tell you what I think, huh?

07:08.094 --> 07:09.094
Sure.

07:09.303 --> 07:10.763
Your guy commits rape number one.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.558
Then there's a big gap, a year and a half,
before he does it again.

07:13.641 --> 07:16.144
- Right.
- But the gap between rapes two and three?

07:16.227 --> 07:17.645
- Five weeks.
- Right.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.814
A shrinking window. He's accelerating.

07:19.897 --> 07:21.315
And not just in time frame.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.734
The first attack in Aurora - no weapon.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.404
He didn't use one, he didn't refer to one.

07:26.487 --> 07:27.321
Correct.

07:27.405 --> 07:29.991
The next case in Westminster,
he talked about a gun.

07:30.616 --> 07:33.744
Threatened to use it on the victim.
But she never saw it, so...

07:34.078 --> 07:35.998
maybe he had one, maybe he didn't.
We don't know.

07:36.080 --> 07:39.333
In the third, he not only had a handgun,
but he pointed it at the victim's head.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.980
A pattern of escalating threat.
Each incident more violent, more frequent.

07:43.004 --> 07:46.215
It's like the progression of an addict
needing a bigger hit to get the same high.

07:46.841 --> 07:50.136
There is an upside. A guy who's jonesing
might not be as careful.

07:50.636 --> 07:53.473
Maybe next time, he gets sloppy.
Leaves something behind.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.600
- Gets spotted by a witness.
- Or...

07:56.350 --> 07:58.603
maybe next time, he pulls the trigger.

07:59.729 --> 08:00.938
Third option.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.484
We make sure next time never happens.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.949
For what it's worth, I would have told him
about the cop angle.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.785
We came here to get information from him.
Not vice versa.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.829
He might have a bead on dirty cops.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.332
Or he might tell his entire team
what we're thinking.

08:19.415 --> 08:22.043
Next thing you know, we're known
statewide as the two lady cops

08:22.126 --> 08:24.837
trying to nail this on one
of their coworkers. No, thank you.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.298
This one, we're figuring out on our own.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.393
Okay, step through.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.477
Thank you.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.319
Next, here we go.

09:13.761 --> 09:14.762
Can I help you?

09:17.223 --> 09:18.391
Um...

09:19.141 --> 09:21.435
I... I got this a couple of weeks ago.

09:22.353 --> 09:25.773
Uh, it's a citation, and it said to wait
for further instructions,

09:25.856 --> 09:27.984
but I didn't get any.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.861
I was just wondering if there's something
I'm supposed to do about it?

09:30.945 --> 09:31.945
Let me see.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.367
Okay.

09:40.496 --> 09:41.496
Ms. Adler,

09:41.747 --> 09:45.876
according to my computer, it looks like
you missed a court date yesterday

09:45.960 --> 09:48.170
and there's a warrant out for your arrest.

09:49.797 --> 09:50.798
W... what?

09:51.549 --> 09:54.969
How was I supposed to know that? It didn't
say anything about a court date on there.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.804
- Okay, easy now...
- That's not fair.

09:57.054 --> 09:58.889
Okay, now let me just...

09:59.390 --> 10:02.151
H... how can they arrest you for something
you didn't even know about?

10:02.643 --> 10:04.020
Ah. Okay.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.523
Looks like the hearing notice was sent
to a different address

10:07.607 --> 10:09.317
than the one here on the citation.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.861
Columbus Street, Seattle.
Is that where you live?

10:12.403 --> 10:14.488
Columbus?
I haven't lived there in fi... five years.

10:14.572 --> 10:17.241
- I... I don't talk to those people anymore.
- Oh, boy.

10:18.826 --> 10:21.621
Well, why would they send the citation
to the right address,

10:21.704 --> 10:23.372
but the hearing notice to the wrong one?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.625
Well, the citation is issued
in one office,

10:25.708 --> 10:27.376
the hearing notice is in another.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.128
They don't talk to each other.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.380
It's a problem. Come with me.

10:37.553 --> 10:40.806
All right, so, since the hearing notice
was sent to the wrong address,

10:40.890 --> 10:43.130
which is not your fault,
the judge has lifted the warrant

10:43.184 --> 10:45.227
and rescheduled your arraignment
for this afternoon.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.604
You give this to your lawyer

10:46.687 --> 10:49.482
and tell them you have to be
in front of the judge this afternoon.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.193
Uh, I... I don't have a lawyer.

10:52.526 --> 10:53.986
What am I supposed to do? I...

10:54.070 --> 10:55.363
Okay, deep breath.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.490
Let's see.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.160
Ah! Mr. Hughes!

11:01.786 --> 11:02.786
Hold up.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.456
Uh, no, no, no, no, Ms. Bell, no.

11:05.539 --> 11:08.000
How can you say no before you even know
what I'm going to say?

11:08.084 --> 11:09.460
Long and bitter experience.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.380
This young lady has to be
in front of Judge Costas today at 3:00,

11:12.463 --> 11:14.882
and she needs a public defender.
Now, isn't that what you do?

11:14.965 --> 11:17.152
I don't work for the PD.
I'm a court-appointed attorney.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.804
- Mr. Hughes is gonna help you, honey.
- I'm sorry. No, I'm not.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.139
I'm sorry. I've got four cases
on the docket this morning

11:22.223 --> 11:24.284
and a pretrial motion this afternoon.
There's no way.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.352
Ms... No, I'm...

11:28.688 --> 11:30.564
I'm sorry, no.

11:33.275 --> 11:34.985
This is bizarre.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.822
They don't usually charge these.

11:39.782 --> 11:42.502
What do... what do you mean a charge?
Do I have to pay for something?

11:43.202 --> 11:46.789
No, no, no. It's just that police
don't usually pursue cases like this.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.374
False reports, I mean...

11:48.999 --> 11:51.001
it basically never happens.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.170
Unless...

11:54.672 --> 11:55.798
Did you name someone?

11:58.175 --> 11:59.677
You mean, like the guy who...

12:04.765 --> 12:06.559
No, I don't know who...

12:08.352 --> 12:09.562
I... I mean, no.

12:16.277 --> 12:22.366
To the crime of False Reporting pursuant
to RCW9A.84.040,

12:22.616 --> 12:24.076
how does the defendant plead?

12:26.746 --> 12:28.664
Not guilty, Your Honor.

12:30.541 --> 12:31.541
Miss Adler?

12:31.667 --> 12:33.335
You need to say it yourself.

12:34.837 --> 12:35.837
How do you plead?

12:39.967 --> 12:42.647
Okay, you got a court date in a month.
I'll contact you before that.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.805
Okay. Thank you so much, Mr. Hughes.

12:44.889 --> 12:48.017
All right, I'll call you as soon as I get
the discovery and talk to the DA.

12:48.309 --> 12:51.854
Okay. Um, sorry, can I ask you a question?

12:52.855 --> 12:53.855
Uh...

12:54.523 --> 12:55.523
Uh, yeah.

12:55.858 --> 12:59.320
So, I... I just got charged
for... for making a false report

12:59.612 --> 13:01.989
because I told the police that I lied.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.784
But why did I just plead not guilty?

13:05.201 --> 13:08.537
Isn't that just like another false report?

13:10.998 --> 13:12.708
Okay, do you, um...

13:13.918 --> 13:16.462
do understand what a gross misdemeanor is?

13:16.712 --> 13:18.881
Not specifically. But it's bad, right?

13:18.964 --> 13:21.509
Well, it carries a maximum penalty
of a year in jail

13:21.592 --> 13:23.052
and a fine of $5,000.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.855
If you'd pled guilty, the judge
would have sent you straight to jail.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.556
You pled not guilty to give me a chance

13:27.640 --> 13:29.600
to reach out to the DA
and try to work out a deal.

13:29.683 --> 13:31.769
- It's called a plea bargain.
- A plea bargain, okay.

13:31.852 --> 13:34.021
Now, while I'm negotiating with the DA,

13:34.688 --> 13:35.731
no screw-ups.

13:35.815 --> 13:36.815
No partying.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.609
No interaction with the police.

13:38.692 --> 13:41.153
I... I don't even want you to get
a... a parking ticket.

13:41.570 --> 13:43.072
I don't have a license, so...

13:44.323 --> 13:48.077
Just, gold-star behavior
while I work out a deal. Okay?

13:48.577 --> 13:49.577
Yes, sir.

13:58.212 --> 14:01.841
With this ViCAP website, you need
to enter every detail of every assault.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.677
It's gonna take time.
If you got a date tonight, cancel it.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.762
Oh, yeah, no, I don't have a...

14:06.846 --> 14:07.847
What you got?

14:07.930 --> 14:09.056
Mazda sales.

14:09.139 --> 14:12.434
About 3,000 white ones
of that model on the roads in Colorado.

14:12.518 --> 14:16.146
None of which have shown up
in any body shop with a broken mirror.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.027
Goddammit, what am I doing wrong?

14:23.320 --> 14:24.780
You guys don't have one of these?

14:24.864 --> 14:28.492
In Golden? I think we have an old
DVD player in a closet somewhere.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.788
Beautiful, thanks.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.249
Okay, so, this cop angle.

14:35.332 --> 14:36.542
Going off what we know.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.377
Knowledge of police procedure,

14:38.460 --> 14:41.630
travel history, and language skills
of someone in the military.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.968
This is a list of all current
and former cops

14:46.051 --> 14:49.805
who sought a military credit when applying
for the job in the last ten years.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.306
That's a lot of names.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.602
How'd you get all those departments
to release their military records?

14:54.685 --> 14:58.105
I told them I was putting together
a Veteran's Day honors list.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.025
Anyway, yeah, it's a lot of names.

15:01.108 --> 15:03.777
So, how do we narrow them down?
Let's start with the obvious.

15:03.861 --> 15:04.695
Priors.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.823
Have any of these guys been arrested
for sexual assault?

15:07.907 --> 15:10.159
Answer, yes. Eight of them.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.952
Here are their mug shots.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.788
We can eliminate based on age,

15:15.497 --> 15:16.497
race,

15:16.916 --> 15:19.126
and physical description.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.212
Delbert Karp?

15:22.880 --> 15:24.214
Could that be our guy?

15:24.840 --> 15:26.425
Not unless our assaults happened

15:26.508 --> 15:28.302
within the walls
of Arkansas Valley Prison,

15:28.385 --> 15:30.971
where Mr. Karp is serving 11 years

15:31.055 --> 15:33.474
for sexual assault on a child,
class 3.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.812
I looked up correlations between rapes
and other crimes.

15:38.896 --> 15:42.066
Turns out, 37 percent of rapists

15:42.149 --> 15:45.194
also end up
with a domestic disturbance arrest.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.195
Really?

15:46.278 --> 15:50.240
Yep. So, maybe we look at
domestic violence arrests in these guys.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.451
Try to thin the list that way.

15:52.826 --> 15:56.747
Well, you know as well as I do,
a cop hits his girl, someone finds out,

15:57.081 --> 16:01.251
more often than not, a complaint like that
ends up in Internal Affairs, not arrest.

16:01.585 --> 16:06.131
Right. So, the information we need
is in their IA file.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.051
Which we are never gonna get to see.

16:10.219 --> 16:13.013
What if I said I was putting together
a wife beaters honors list?

16:13.722 --> 16:15.450
Think they'd buy that?

16:25.859 --> 16:28.821
Arturo Bolinas,
this is Detective Duvall.

16:29.196 --> 16:30.239
Hi, Arturo.

16:31.281 --> 16:32.408
What can I do for you?

16:33.701 --> 16:35.411
Hey. Yeah. Um...

16:37.079 --> 16:39.748
It's about, uh, this.

16:40.749 --> 16:41.917
Our flyer?

16:42.876 --> 16:43.961
Where'd you see it?

16:44.586 --> 16:45.587
On campus.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.589
You go to Braeton?

16:47.881 --> 16:49.216
Yeah, third year.

16:51.176 --> 16:54.346
When you saw our flyer there,
it got your attention?

16:55.639 --> 16:58.142
Yeah, it kinda made me go, "Huh..."

16:58.684 --> 16:59.768
'Cause, um...

17:00.269 --> 17:01.645
there's this guy I know.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.104
What's his name?

17:04.606 --> 17:05.648
Scott Parrish.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.778
And what about this
made you think of Scott?

17:12.239 --> 17:13.323
Because he's like...

17:14.867 --> 17:16.535
I mean, that's kind of what he does.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.372
What does Scott do

17:21.080 --> 17:24.667
that makes you think that he might be
a person of interest in this case?

17:27.628 --> 17:28.629
He, like,

17:29.381 --> 17:30.591
forces girls

17:31.341 --> 17:32.426
to have sex.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.307
Tell me about that.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.996
Scott's not gonna know I'm the one
who talked to you, will he?

17:43.020 --> 17:44.480
Not at this point, no.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.151
How do you know that Parrish rapes women?

17:50.152 --> 17:51.403
That's not what I said.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.321
Yeah, it is.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.116
You said he forces women to have sex.

17:56.492 --> 17:57.492
That's rape.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.705
How do you know that Scott does this?

18:03.082 --> 18:04.083
Everyone does.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.960
We've all, like, seen him do it.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.338
I mean, not... not, like, <i>seen,</i>

18:10.172 --> 18:13.467
but, like, this one time,
he got this girl so wasted,

18:13.550 --> 18:15.135
she wasn't even really conscious,

18:15.219 --> 18:17.346
and he just took her up
to his room anyway.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.266
How'd you know he was taking her upstairs
to have sex?

18:22.142 --> 18:23.142
It was obvious.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.146
I left pretty quick after that.

18:26.563 --> 18:28.816
The whole scene kinda freaked me out.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.025
You know?

18:30.109 --> 18:32.402
It just felt wrong.

18:33.612 --> 18:36.365
What happened to the girl, afterwards?
Do you know?

18:37.783 --> 18:39.159
Like I said, I left.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.705
I don't think she did anything. She just...

18:45.040 --> 18:46.458
But another time,

18:47.042 --> 18:48.377
with this other girl,

18:48.460 --> 18:50.963
she reported it,
and Scott got arrested and everything.

18:54.091 --> 18:57.094
The accuser claimed she'd gotten drunk
at a fraternity party.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.096
Parrish pressured her to have sex,

18:59.179 --> 19:00.722
saying if she didn't, he'd,

19:00.806 --> 19:03.142
quoting here,
"Tell everyone she was a slut."

19:03.767 --> 19:06.478
She agreed reluctantly, then changed
her mind and tried to leave.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.523
Parrish restrained her
and proceeded to assault her.

19:11.358 --> 19:14.319
"Victim reports the rape to campus police
the next day.

19:14.903 --> 19:17.030
Campus police report it to local police.

19:17.990 --> 19:21.160
Victim declines to press charges.
Charges dismissed."

19:21.869 --> 19:23.495
Anything else on his record?

19:24.288 --> 19:25.288
That's it.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.586
Are you Facebook friends with him?

19:38.552 --> 19:39.761
Is that a birthmark?

19:44.183 --> 19:46.351
Does Scott have a birthmark
on his left leg?

19:46.643 --> 19:48.103
I don't know. He might.

19:52.357 --> 19:53.817
It's too blurry to tell.

19:54.776 --> 19:59.072
Yeah, unfortunately,
this is the only photo that shows it.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.533
But, here.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.328
Light eyes...

20:05.746 --> 20:06.746
tall...

20:08.498 --> 20:09.541
strong.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.796
I don't... I don't know.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.506
It could be him.

20:17.591 --> 20:18.634
I can't tell.

20:20.093 --> 20:22.554
Do you see anything here
that rules him out?

20:25.265 --> 20:26.265
No.

20:26.850 --> 20:27.850
Okay.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.270
Thank you.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.611
You look like you're heading out.

20:38.528 --> 20:40.447
Taking your boyfriend somewhere fun?

20:41.740 --> 20:44.785
Uh, no. He's not here anymore.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.119
Um...

20:47.621 --> 20:48.789
we were kind of...

20:51.416 --> 20:52.626
I don't... I don't know.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.878
He was bugging me, so he went home.

20:57.839 --> 20:59.508
My friends have been super cool, though.

20:59.591 --> 21:01.760
They've been taking me out,
cheering me up.

21:02.761 --> 21:05.347
Can't spend my whole life locked up
in my apartment.

21:05.847 --> 21:07.015
You sleeping well?

21:07.391 --> 21:08.517
Eatin' okay?

21:08.767 --> 21:09.767
I'm a student.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.436
We never eat or sleep well.

21:14.773 --> 21:17.192
Um... That's, um... I should go.

21:30.914 --> 21:31.999
Mr. Parrish.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.753
I'm Detective Duvall.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.421
Hey.

21:39.172 --> 21:40.424
Hi. Um...

21:41.341 --> 21:43.510
So, what's this about?

21:46.138 --> 21:49.641
'Cause that thing sophomore year
got all resolved, you know.

21:50.684 --> 21:51.684
What thing?

21:53.186 --> 21:54.186
That.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.357
When that girl made that thing up
about me.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.361
You can see, it got totally cleared up.

22:02.821 --> 22:06.033
I was really grateful to you guys
for seeing it for what it was.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.118
Which was what?

22:09.619 --> 22:13.540
Just, you know,
getting with the wrong girl.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.127
What was wrong about her?

22:19.504 --> 22:20.672
It's all in there.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.592
We hooked up the one time,

22:24.217 --> 22:27.554
and when she realized that was all
it was gonna be, she just...

22:29.723 --> 22:31.975
I hate to say it, she just kinda went off.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.145
Off in what way?

22:36.480 --> 22:37.731
Made stuff up.

22:39.316 --> 22:40.817
It happens all the time now.

22:41.485 --> 22:43.820
Girls making all these claims...

22:44.154 --> 22:45.197
it's a thing.

22:46.406 --> 22:48.533
There's status to being a victim.

22:50.243 --> 22:51.453
Which is bullshit.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.331
Because there are real victims out there,

22:54.414 --> 22:57.254
and when you go around saying
you have been victimized when you haven't,

22:57.292 --> 22:59.852
it just makes it harder for those people
who really do need help.

22:59.920 --> 23:00.921
Mm-hm.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.590
And then, guys like me,

23:03.965 --> 23:07.636
normal guys, end up getting accused
of all kinds of crazy stuff.

23:09.429 --> 23:10.514
Like what else?

23:12.182 --> 23:14.017
What do you... what do you mean?

23:14.101 --> 23:15.977
You said, "All kinds of crazy stuff."

23:16.061 --> 23:18.605
What other accusations have there been
against you?

23:19.022 --> 23:20.148
No... none.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.276
Why? Did somebody say something?

23:23.693 --> 23:24.736
About what?

23:26.488 --> 23:28.657
Look, I didn't do anything to anybody.

23:29.741 --> 23:32.619
And that's not me saying that.
That's you guys, Golden PD.

23:32.702 --> 23:33.745
Not really.

23:33.829 --> 23:36.224
What the department said was
that it couldn't pursue the case

23:36.248 --> 23:38.250
because the victim
didn't want to press charges.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.043
Yeah, because it was bullshit.

23:41.461 --> 23:42.921
Do I need to be here?

23:43.755 --> 23:46.341
You haven't even told me
what the hell I'm here for.

23:47.467 --> 23:51.930
Can you tell me where you were
on the morning of Thursday, May 26th,

23:52.013 --> 23:54.266
between the hours of 5:00 a.m. and noon?

23:55.684 --> 23:57.477
Are you accusing me of something?

23:58.478 --> 24:00.272
- Do I need a lawyer?
- I don't know.

24:00.856 --> 24:01.856
Do you?

24:02.482 --> 24:03.567
I didn't do anything.

24:03.650 --> 24:07.195
Thursday, May 26th,
between the hours of 5:00 a.m. and noon?

24:07.279 --> 24:08.864
So...

24:09.865 --> 24:10.782
last Thursday.

24:10.866 --> 24:14.035
Well, at five, I was probably
in my room asleep.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.954
- Alone?
- Yes.

24:16.037 --> 24:17.914
- Alone.
- Can anyone verify that?

24:17.998 --> 24:21.168
- Did anyone see you?
- Did anyone see me sleeping? No.

24:21.668 --> 24:23.462
What about after that? Were you in class?

24:23.962 --> 24:26.089
I mean, I have a class Thursday morning.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.592
I don't go much. I don't need to.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.468
I have an A.

24:31.428 --> 24:34.055
So, no one saw you between the hours
of 5:00 a.m. and noon

24:34.389 --> 24:35.891
on Thursday the 26th?

24:35.974 --> 24:39.436
How about April 22nd, between the hours
of 3:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.?

24:39.811 --> 24:42.481
- Are you kidding me?
- No, Mr. Parrish, I am not.

24:42.564 --> 24:45.609
April 22nd, 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.?

24:45.692 --> 24:48.236
I have no idea where I was. Okay?

24:48.320 --> 24:51.698
But if it was three o'clock
in the morning, I was probably sleeping.

24:52.407 --> 24:53.407
Alone?

24:54.075 --> 24:55.952
Probably. Why the fuck would I keep...

24:56.703 --> 24:58.997
Wait. April 22nd?

24:59.372 --> 25:00.372
Yes.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.626
Yeah, my parents were in town.

25:03.710 --> 25:06.421
They booked a suite at The Brown Palace,
and I stayed with them.

25:09.799 --> 25:12.135
Well, you can call the hotel.
They all saw me.

25:13.011 --> 25:16.348
You know what? Definitely call my parents.
I'll give you my dad's cell number.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.600
He's gonna love this.

25:18.975 --> 25:22.312
You know, he came this close to suing
you guys last time for harassment.

25:22.395 --> 25:24.105
He's gonna fucking lose his mind.

25:27.901 --> 25:30.612
Mr. Parrish, do you have a birthmark
on your lower left calf?

25:33.198 --> 25:34.198
What?

25:34.950 --> 25:37.619
No, I do not have a birthmark
on my lower left calf.

25:38.119 --> 25:39.746
Would you be willing to show me?

25:39.829 --> 25:41.831
Show you the birthmark that I don't have?

25:41.915 --> 25:43.708
Show me your lower left calf.

25:52.592 --> 25:54.094
Pretty freaky birthmark, huh?

25:55.971 --> 25:59.599
You're so screwed, Detective.
You're the one who's gonna need a lawyer.

26:01.101 --> 26:02.477
What the fuck, lady?

26:02.811 --> 26:05.605
- I didn't say you could do that.
- I don't need your permission.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.650
Thank you for your time.

26:16.992 --> 26:17.992
Shit.

26:29.963 --> 26:32.382
Would've been nice and simple
if it had been him.

26:33.174 --> 26:36.636
Yeah, that's, uh,
that's not how this one's going down.

26:39.472 --> 26:40.765
You can just tell, huh?

26:42.017 --> 26:43.184
Fourteen years,

26:43.852 --> 26:44.853
the gut knows.

26:47.689 --> 26:51.151
Guess my gut's in the development phase.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.989
Just made detective six years ago.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.159
Hm. You must've been a baby.

27:02.329 --> 27:03.747
I'm older than I look.

27:07.417 --> 27:08.460
What's that?

27:09.210 --> 27:12.339
It's a study.
Police officers and domestic violence.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.633
You know, a light, fun, beach read.

27:16.051 --> 27:21.473
Spoiler alert, the percentage of cops
who self-report as domestic abusers - 40.

27:22.932 --> 27:24.351
- Forty?
- Yep.

27:24.684 --> 27:26.603
Almost half our brothers in blue.

27:27.437 --> 27:28.521
How about that?

27:30.023 --> 27:31.483
You don't seem surprised.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.150
Are you?

27:33.610 --> 27:34.653
A little, yeah.

27:36.112 --> 27:37.822
Must be nice over there in Golden.

27:54.964 --> 27:55.965
See you tomorrow.

27:56.716 --> 27:57.717
Yep.

28:06.309 --> 28:08.520
<i>Lynwood Police have arrested
four teenage boys...</i>

28:08.603 --> 28:10.230
And what did the lawyer say?

28:10.814 --> 28:12.982
He said he'd try to get me a plea bargain.

28:13.274 --> 28:15.443
But he also said it was bizarre.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.988
Bizarre? What... what'd he mean?
Like, legally bizarre? What?

28:19.531 --> 28:22.117
Just, like, weird that they'd even
charge me at all.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.661
Because he said that they usually
don't do that.

28:25.662 --> 28:26.871
That sounds like a good sign.

28:27.122 --> 28:29.040
If it's something
they usually don't charge,

28:29.124 --> 28:31.167
they'll probably be less inclined to...

28:31.751 --> 28:33.253
whatever, prosecute it.

28:33.336 --> 28:34.936
- Yeah.
- Well, you don't know that.

28:34.963 --> 28:36.798
He could... he could totally charge me.

28:36.881 --> 28:39.509
- And put me in jail.
- Whoa, Nelly! Slow down.

28:39.801 --> 28:42.220
Honey, you just said he was gonna
get you a deal.

28:42.303 --> 28:43.471
He said he'd try.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.235
They wouldn't dangle a deal
in front of you if they couldn't get it.

28:47.142 --> 28:48.268
Lawyers don't do that.

28:49.310 --> 28:50.520
- Really?
- Yes.

28:50.603 --> 28:53.440
If he said he's gonna get you a deal,
he's gonna get you a deal.

28:53.523 --> 28:57.026
Really, what are they gonna do?
Put you in jail for one mistake?

28:57.444 --> 29:00.113
Please, honey. No judge is gonna do that.

29:05.827 --> 29:09.664
The trick is, keep 'em off the bottom,
let 'em float to the top.

29:09.956 --> 29:13.293
<i>Disturbing news out of Kirkland,

<i>- Police say a masked assailant, armed...</i>

Just listen.

29:44.949 --> 29:47.660
Honey, that's the same thing
you said happened to you.

29:47.744 --> 29:49.871
Okay, I'm a little confused here.
What?

29:49.954 --> 29:52.373
A mask, a knife, the pictures?

29:53.458 --> 29:55.627
You said you made... you made it up.

29:56.586 --> 29:57.586
Did you?

29:57.962 --> 29:59.923
- What?
- Did you make it up?

30:01.925 --> 30:04.403
- Yeah, I... that's what I told...
- So, there's another woman,

30:04.427 --> 30:06.614
attacked in exactly the same way
that you said you were.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.157
- It... it's a coincidence?
- I guess.

30:08.181 --> 30:11.142
- I mean, how... how would I know?
- Okay, honey, you need to talk to me.

30:11.226 --> 30:12.226
Okay?

30:13.311 --> 30:15.522
Did this horrible thing
really happen to you?

30:17.190 --> 30:18.650
Were you raped that night?

30:22.403 --> 30:23.279
Okay.

30:23.363 --> 30:25.644
Okay, we need to unwind this.
You need to call the police.

30:25.698 --> 30:27.534
And you have to tell them
whatever you know.

30:28.868 --> 30:30.203
I don't know anything.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.331
- The water's boiling.
- Honey, listen.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.124
You need to tell me the truth.

30:35.208 --> 30:36.501
Okay? Whatever it is.

30:37.293 --> 30:40.630
Because if you were raped,
and the person that did that did this...

30:41.214 --> 30:42.934
- What?
- Well, then we'll go to the police,

30:43.007 --> 30:44.367
and we'll explain the whole thing.

30:44.425 --> 30:46.145
I can't have anything to do
with the police.

30:46.177 --> 30:48.304
Mr. Hughes already said that.
He made it super clear.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.014
- But...
- But what?

30:50.598 --> 30:52.016
You want me to go back in and say,

30:52.100 --> 30:54.519
"Hey, I know I said I was lying,
but I was lying.

30:55.103 --> 30:56.354
Or maybe now I'm lying.

30:56.980 --> 30:58.189
Or maybe I'm not lying."

30:58.273 --> 31:01.568
It doesn't matter anyway,
because I wasn't raped.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.446
No one came into my apartment.

31:05.947 --> 31:07.282
He wasn't wearing a mask.

31:07.866 --> 31:08.866
It doesn't...

31:09.617 --> 31:10.660
It didn't happen.

32:47.840 --> 32:50.259
No sign of forced entry, he wore a mask.

32:50.343 --> 32:52.845
The scene's scrubbed clean of prints,
fibers, DNA.

32:52.929 --> 32:55.890
He made the victims wash themselves.
Took the bed sheets with him.

32:58.559 --> 33:01.354
It doesn't sound like any
of our assaults over in Littleton.

33:01.437 --> 33:04.107
We've had three, maybe four, campus rapes.

33:04.190 --> 33:06.109
Uh, two date rapes, both dismissed.

33:06.192 --> 33:08.945
One stranger rape,
but that was daylight in a park,

33:09.028 --> 33:10.113
and we caught the guy.

33:10.196 --> 33:11.781
And he's been in jail at least a month.

33:11.864 --> 33:16.202
We had a woman call in to report a man
in a mask, creeping around her backyard.

33:16.285 --> 33:18.722
No prints or anything,
but she did get a good look at the guy.

33:18.746 --> 33:20.832
- I'll send you a link to the file.
- Great.

33:20.915 --> 33:21.749
Yeah.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.127
Mm, this might be a stretch,
but a few months ago,

33:24.210 --> 33:26.963
we got a report of suspicious noises
scaring this lady.

33:27.046 --> 33:30.049
She never saw anyone,
so I don't know if it was masked or not,

33:30.133 --> 33:31.509
but when the patrol showed up,

33:31.592 --> 33:34.178
they found one of her window screens
lying on the ground.

33:34.262 --> 33:36.472
Yeah, send me that too?

33:36.556 --> 33:37.556
Yep.

33:39.183 --> 33:40.183
Shit.

33:40.351 --> 33:41.686
What kind of mask was it?

33:41.769 --> 33:44.355
A piece of black, stretchy fabric
with holes for his eyes.

33:44.939 --> 33:47.692
Okay, this was... maybe a year ago?
I'll check the date.

33:47.775 --> 33:49.610
It was a B&E and attempted rape.

33:50.069 --> 33:51.779
And the attacker wore a mask?

33:51.863 --> 33:53.573
Yeah, black Lycra.

33:53.990 --> 33:56.117
And no sign of forced entry, no DNA.

33:56.367 --> 33:58.786
- We did get a glove print.
- No, shit. Our guy wore gloves.

33:58.870 --> 33:59.954
And a shoe print.

34:00.496 --> 34:03.291
- Send me both tomorrow?
- Yeah, yeah, first thing.

34:03.833 --> 34:07.754
The victim got away by diving headfirst
off her second floor balcony.

34:07.962 --> 34:08.795
Wow.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.799
Yeah, she got banged up.
Cracked pelvis, broken leg.

34:12.967 --> 34:13.967
But...

34:15.261 --> 34:16.554
she didn't get raped.

34:22.810 --> 34:25.521
You're not looking for me.
You want my daughter, Lilly.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.982
She's away until tomorrow.
I'm watching her cat.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.415
Can you tell us what time you expect her?

34:30.443 --> 34:32.320
We'd like to talk to her as soon
as possible.

34:32.652 --> 34:34.447
Oh, now it's urgent.

34:34.530 --> 34:37.158
But when she's in the hospital
with shattered bones,

34:37.241 --> 34:40.078
then it's the least important thing
on any police agenda.

34:40.161 --> 34:43.998
Ma'am, Detective Rasmussen and I think
that what happened to your daughter

34:44.456 --> 34:45.750
is very important.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.418
That is why we are here.

34:47.710 --> 34:52.090
We think that the man who attacked her
might have attacked other women as well.

34:53.216 --> 34:55.384
Really? You think so?

34:55.676 --> 34:58.387
My daughter told the detective
exactly that.

34:58.471 --> 35:01.099
That this was a man on the hunt,
who's gonna do it again.

35:01.682 --> 35:04.143
And now what, a year later,
there's follow-up?

35:04.227 --> 35:05.937
I call that too little too late.

35:06.020 --> 35:07.700
Well, I can tell that you are dissatisfied

35:07.730 --> 35:10.733
with the way that the original detective
pursued the matter.

35:11.859 --> 35:15.905
His name is Harkness,
and he didn't pursue it.

35:15.988 --> 35:19.033
That only makes me more eager
to speak with Lilly.

35:19.659 --> 35:23.162
Can you tell us what time tomorrow
you expect her back?

35:23.663 --> 35:27.083
No. She'll come back when Spirit
releases her.

35:30.044 --> 35:31.212
It's Alban Hefin.

35:31.546 --> 35:32.922
In my daughter's faith,

35:33.005 --> 35:34.966
it's one of the year's most sacred days

35:35.049 --> 35:37.343
when the veil between our world

35:37.426 --> 35:40.012
and the world of Spirit
is especially thin.

35:43.015 --> 35:44.015
So, um...

35:45.351 --> 35:46.686
Lilly is a Druid?

35:47.603 --> 35:48.603
Yes.

35:50.148 --> 35:54.068
She was raised Episcopalian,
but she's found her own...

35:55.153 --> 35:56.320
faith community,

35:56.404 --> 35:58.823
which I wholeheartedly support.

35:59.115 --> 36:04.120
Mrs. Darrow, the last thing I'd want to do
is come between Lilly and her worship.

36:06.372 --> 36:08.958
When Spirit releases her,

36:09.959 --> 36:11.836
please ask her to give us a call.

36:14.881 --> 36:15.881
I'll do that.

36:20.386 --> 36:22.930
So, assuming they're all our guy,

36:24.557 --> 36:26.184
he's still moving around.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.145
Still less and less time between them.

36:29.687 --> 36:32.190
Makes you want to put a patrol
on the house of every woman

36:32.273 --> 36:33.524
who lives alone.

36:33.608 --> 36:35.776
I'm glad PR put those alerts out.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.864
You know what I think about these things?

36:40.656 --> 36:44.368
I think the people who read 'em are
the ones who are already being careful.

36:44.452 --> 36:47.788
You know, they're already setting
their alarms and locking their doors.

36:47.872 --> 36:48.789
It's the other ones.

36:48.873 --> 36:51.834
The ones who look at a sign like this
and think, "Gee, that's a shame."

36:51.918 --> 36:54.598
Then they go to sleep at night
with their bedroom windows wide-open.

36:54.962 --> 36:56.214
I mean, a piece of paper?

36:57.465 --> 37:00.176
It's not gonna keep the next victim
from getting raped.

37:01.886 --> 37:02.970
That's on us.

37:14.482 --> 37:18.402
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

37:18.486 --> 37:19.904
Ah, what are you doing?

37:21.781 --> 37:24.200
Oh, shit, Gracie.

37:24.283 --> 37:26.118
Shoot, sorry.

37:27.662 --> 37:29.163
You're off your game, girl.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.999
Aw, I'm distracted. Sorry.

37:39.799 --> 37:42.426
No point in saying not to let it
get to you, I guess.

37:51.811 --> 37:52.895
It might be a cop.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.356
Our rapist.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.149
What makes you say that?

37:57.566 --> 37:59.151
Well, he thinks like a cop.

37:59.902 --> 38:01.404
Knows how to cover his tracks.

38:01.946 --> 38:03.072
Left us nothing.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.575
I read the file of that frat house mother.

38:06.659 --> 38:09.161
Same thing.
Those cops threw everything at it.

38:09.453 --> 38:11.247
Didn't come close to catching him.

38:12.081 --> 38:14.161
I got to come up with something
they didn't think of.

38:17.253 --> 38:19.755
The thing is... I mean, if it is a cop
who's doing this,

38:19.839 --> 38:21.507
I'd expect to see other problems.

38:22.091 --> 38:25.052
You know, the kind that shows up
in other places,

38:25.136 --> 38:27.847
like, trouble with the wife,
trouble with the partner.

38:31.684 --> 38:33.769
Stuff that wouldn't end up
in his legal record

38:33.853 --> 38:36.397
but could definitely be
in his personnel file.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.031
Gracie?

38:45.114 --> 38:46.115
Okay, hear me out.

38:46.198 --> 38:48.117
- I've got a list of names...
- No.

38:50.536 --> 38:51.662
You won't even hear me out?

38:51.746 --> 38:55.082
I can't use my position at the Attorney
General's office to pull personnel files.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.543
- You know that.
- It's in your power. This is what you do.

38:57.626 --> 39:00.338
In my official line of work
as an investigator, yes.

39:00.713 --> 39:02.798
But not as a favor to anyone who asks.

39:03.716 --> 39:04.716
It's not anyone.

39:05.217 --> 39:07.219
- It's me.
- There's no difference, hon.

39:07.303 --> 39:09.430
Well, thank you.
Nice to know where I rank.

39:10.806 --> 39:14.226
Do you know how impossible it is
to get at those files?

39:14.310 --> 39:16.145
For good reason. They're private.

39:16.228 --> 39:17.988
You're not giving them to the press.
It's me.

39:18.064 --> 39:20.858
If I don't find anything, that's that.
I'll forget I ever saw 'em.

39:24.779 --> 39:25.779
Great.

39:26.155 --> 39:27.155
Well...

39:28.074 --> 39:31.535
This is a bullshit argument.
You knew my answer before you even asked.

39:43.297 --> 39:47.259
So, I should be home in 20 minutes.

39:47.843 --> 39:50.113
<i>I won't be there.
I'm already on the road.</i>

39:50.137 --> 39:51.305
Oh, shoot.

39:52.264 --> 39:53.682
Who's with the girls?

39:53.766 --> 39:54.850
<i>Uh, no one.</i>

39:55.226 --> 39:56.268
I left them alone.

39:57.353 --> 39:59.355
Why? What's the worst that could happen?

40:00.022 --> 40:01.022
<i>Funny.</i>

40:02.066 --> 40:03.275
I'm a funny guy.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.489
Uh...

40:08.989 --> 40:10.282
I gotta go.

40:10.366 --> 40:11.366
You okay?

40:11.575 --> 40:13.285
Yeah, I'll see you in the morning.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.479
Roll down your window!

40:44.400 --> 40:46.235
Put your hands on the wheel.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.578
I'm sorry, Officer,
did I do something wrong?

41:01.542 --> 41:03.961
Sir, I wonder if you're aware
that you were, um...

41:07.923 --> 41:10.176
I'm sorry, my mistake. Have a good night.
