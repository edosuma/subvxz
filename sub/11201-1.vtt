16:47.330 --> 16:50.030
In Kvasir's case,
I think it was perspiration.

16:51.170 --> 16:55.730
- Any news on Teal'c?
- No. But we have something else.

16:55.840 --> 16:58.540
We downloaded the black box data
from the <i>Korolev.</i>

16:58.640 --> 16:59.940
MITCHELL: We know that six people got off

17:00.050 --> 17:01.740
using beaming technology
before it went up.

17:01.850 --> 17:05.580
None of them was Jackson. However...

17:06.990 --> 17:10.080
- The rings were also activated.
- You betcha.

17:17.800 --> 17:21.700
Sir, sensors are indicating a slight
energy fluctuation in their shields,

17:21.800 --> 17:23.530
coinciding with their own weapon fire.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.330
Beam a nuke on board.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.570
<i>Odyssey</i> is reporting no success

17:31.680 --> 17:34.410
with the attempts to beam weapons
on board enemy ships.

17:34.510 --> 17:38.380
What about rings? I know they use them.
The matter stream might get through.

17:38.480 --> 17:39.640
How can we lock on?

17:39.750 --> 17:42.410
Just set our rings to seek out
the nearest other set. It's worth a shot.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.790
Move closer. I'm on it!

17:44.890 --> 17:48.490
I want that warhead transported
to the ring room now!

17:48.590 --> 17:50.820
Take us closer to the nearest enemy ship.

17:54.330 --> 17:56.960
Set it to go off
five seconds after activation.

18:36.740 --> 18:40.080
You don't know where the enemy ships
are, or what they're capable of?

18:40.180 --> 18:43.640
All we know is they cut through
two of our 304s, an Asgard ship,

18:43.750 --> 18:45.740
and a fleet of Goa'uld motherships.

18:45.850 --> 18:47.790
They could be on their way here
as we speak.

18:47.890 --> 18:49.820
We sent the best we had to stop them.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.860
The I.O.A. Is considering bringing
the Atlantis ZPM to Earth

18:53.960 --> 18:56.160
for use in the
Antarctic Earth defense system.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.250
Even if we had a ship,

18:57.360 --> 19:00.560
it would take a minimum of three weeks
for the ZPM to get here,

19:00.670 --> 19:03.930
and there's no guarantee the
Ancient weapons platform in Antarctica

19:04.040 --> 19:06.000
would be any more effective
against the Ori ships

19:06.110 --> 19:08.570
than what we've already thrown at them.

19:08.670 --> 19:13.040
As usual, the I.O.A.
Is wasting their breath.

19:14.210 --> 19:17.910
You know, if I had the salaries

19:18.020 --> 19:20.710
they pay those idiot blowhard politicians

19:20.820 --> 19:22.880
to put into my budget...

19:24.160 --> 19:26.630
I'm sorry. Did I say that out loud?

19:50.280 --> 19:51.310
(SIGHS)

20:06.000 --> 20:08.660
ORICl: Hello, Mother.

20:08.770 --> 20:11.000
You need not be afraid.

20:15.610 --> 20:19.410
Are you actually going to stop growing
at some point?

20:19.510 --> 20:24.780
Because, well, at this rate,
you're going to have a very short life.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.060
I'm glad you worry for me.

20:40.470 --> 20:44.400
- Are you feeling better?
- I am. Thank you.

20:46.540 --> 20:48.870
I am very hungry.

20:49.980 --> 20:53.610
- Would you like something to eat?
- Okay.

21:05.320 --> 21:07.490
You have questions.

21:08.530 --> 21:10.050
Do you have a name?

21:10.160 --> 21:14.030
- They call me Orici.
- Yeah...

21:14.130 --> 21:16.430
It's not much of a name, is it?

21:17.100 --> 21:19.230
What would you like to call me?

21:20.040 --> 21:21.510
Well...

21:23.510 --> 21:28.710
I always thought that if I had a daughter,
that I'd name her after my mother.

21:28.810 --> 21:31.150
She was a very

21:31.720 --> 21:33.340
strong woman.

21:35.860 --> 21:37.820
Her name was Adria.

21:40.290 --> 21:41.990
I like that.

21:44.660 --> 21:46.220
Adria.

21:49.770 --> 21:53.800
You think that by naming me,
you will humanize me,

21:53.910 --> 21:55.930
make me more like you,

21:56.910 --> 21:59.610
more sympathetic to your point of view.

22:01.750 --> 22:03.680
How do you know what you know?

22:03.780 --> 22:07.810
The Ori wove their knowledge
into my genetic makeup,

22:07.920 --> 22:12.320
at least as much as
my human brain could hold.

22:12.430 --> 22:16.050
All their knowledge is far too much
for us to possibly comprehend.

22:16.160 --> 22:19.960
The understanding of an infinite universe
is obviously without boundaries.

22:20.070 --> 22:22.930
Then you're not actually one of them.

22:23.040 --> 22:28.100
I am the closest I can be
in the form of flesh and blood.

22:28.210 --> 22:30.440
Isn't there a part of you that's from me?

22:30.540 --> 22:34.670
Of course. You are my mother.

22:34.780 --> 22:36.480
Exactly.

22:36.580 --> 22:41.850
And as your mother,
you will listen to me, young lady.

22:41.950 --> 22:48.420
There will be no leading of these ships
and armies on a mass-murdering crusade,

22:48.530 --> 22:50.290
or else.

22:54.070 --> 22:55.120
(SIGHS)

22:55.230 --> 22:57.360
It was worth a try.

22:57.470 --> 23:00.030
I know why you believe what you do,

23:00.140 --> 23:02.660
but the Ancients are the ones
who have lied to you.

23:02.780 --> 23:07.340
They are the ones who, long ago,
tried to destroy the Ori for their beliefs,

23:07.450 --> 23:09.180
not the other way around.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.650
Only the Ori share all they learn.

23:11.750 --> 23:15.740
The Ancients have kept the basic truths
of your existence from you.

23:18.120 --> 23:23.080
They have hoarded their knowledge
and been dishonest about everything.

23:23.200 --> 23:28.130
Contrary to what they've told you, the Ori
most certainly do ascend their followers.

23:28.230 --> 23:31.690
And the Ancients are the ones sapping
energy from humans in this galaxy

23:31.800 --> 23:33.600
to empower themselves.

23:33.710 --> 23:39.910
That is why they created you, to give them
the strength to destroy the Ori

23:40.010 --> 23:41.950
once and for all.

23:42.550 --> 23:46.480
That is why all those who could not
be made to see the true path

23:46.590 --> 23:48.750
must be destroyed

23:48.850 --> 23:51.880
or all will be lost to evil.

23:55.560 --> 23:59.400
Are you saying this is a preemptive strike?
It's self-defense?

23:59.500 --> 24:01.800
It matters not what you call it.

24:02.370 --> 24:04.030
The cause is just,

24:04.600 --> 24:08.440
and the truth will see us through
to victory.

24:08.540 --> 24:13.210
Do you really believe that,
or are you just hoping I will?

24:15.310 --> 24:17.940
Why don't you believe me, Mother?

24:21.790 --> 24:23.480
I don't know.

24:23.590 --> 24:26.560
You choose to take the word of an Ancient
over your daughter.

24:26.660 --> 24:29.180
What have the Ancients done
to earn your trust?

24:29.300 --> 24:31.260
About as much as you.

24:31.800 --> 24:37.260
In the end, only you can decide
the fate of your own soul.

24:44.440 --> 24:46.500
Two motherships just dropped out
of hyperspace.

24:46.610 --> 24:49.050
Come about. Let's face them head-on.

24:49.150 --> 24:52.550
The Lucian Alliance ship
is hailing us again.

24:52.650 --> 24:56.520
<i>Lower your shields and prepare to</i>
<i>be boarded, or you will be destroyed.</i>

24:56.620 --> 25:00.110
<i>I assure you, Captain, I am quite capable</i>
<i>of following through this time.</i>

25:00.230 --> 25:02.490
Shields at 30%.
They won't stand up to much.

25:02.600 --> 25:06.000
Sam, we've got company.
How's that hyperdrive coming?

25:09.940 --> 25:12.840
Not well. Kvasir's still working on
the beam technology.

25:12.940 --> 25:15.740
Sensors indicate the motherships
are powering weapons.

25:25.890 --> 25:27.580
Long story.

25:28.990 --> 25:31.150
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

25:32.090 --> 25:34.990
- What happened to you?
- What do you mean?

25:36.900 --> 25:38.800
Oh, I had a baby.

25:38.900 --> 25:40.890
You know, I never thought
I'd agree with my father,

25:41.000 --> 25:43.990
but now, I'm starting to remember about
how he used to go on about

25:44.100 --> 25:49.040
you nurture them and then you raise them,
and you teach them the best that you can,

25:49.140 --> 25:51.340
and then all they do is break your hearts.

25:51.440 --> 25:53.570
I always assumed that his experience
was just tainted by me.

25:53.680 --> 25:54.670
What are you talking about?

25:54.780 --> 25:57.270
Well, she started off all sweet
and innocent to begin with,

25:57.380 --> 25:59.750
and now she's hell-bent on
domination of the galaxy.

25:59.850 --> 26:02.790
- What? How old is she?
- A few hours.

26:04.290 --> 26:09.160
The Ori used me to sneak one of their own
over the border.

26:09.260 --> 26:12.490
This child is their way of cheating
the ascended rulebook.

26:12.600 --> 26:15.230
Well, they couldn't exactly encroach
on our galaxy themselves

26:15.330 --> 26:18.130
without getting into a confrontation
with the Ancients, right?

26:18.240 --> 26:22.040
So they created their own human
representative with their knowledge

26:22.140 --> 26:23.800
to lead their armies.

26:23.910 --> 26:25.640
Sort of an uber-Prior, like the Doci?

26:25.740 --> 26:28.540
Oh, but she's much worse than that.

26:28.650 --> 26:30.740
The Priors are just pawns.

26:30.850 --> 26:34.750
She knows the score.
She's complicit with the Ori.

26:34.850 --> 26:37.290
You should have heard the propaganda
that she just tried to feed me.

26:37.390 --> 26:39.080
Wait, wait, wait.
We're talking about a baby here, right?

26:39.190 --> 26:41.020
Oh. She's been genetically altered.

26:41.130 --> 26:44.320
She'll be a fully grown figurehead
in a day or so.

26:44.430 --> 26:47.090
If she takes after her mother,
she'll have a pretty good figure, too.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.690
- This is bad.
- You're telling me.

26:48.800 --> 26:51.670
Origin is about to become a lot more
appealing to the males of this galaxy.

26:51.770 --> 26:53.430
Do you have any idea where we're going?

26:53.540 --> 26:56.800
No. That she wouldn't tell me.
She knows I'm not on her side.

26:56.910 --> 26:59.400
She's still hoping I'll see the light.

26:59.510 --> 27:02.110
Part of her can't help but feel tied to me.

27:02.210 --> 27:03.940
She wanted me to give her a name.

27:04.050 --> 27:06.040
- And...
- Adria. I told her it was my mother's...

27:06.150 --> 27:08.210
- Not?
- Stepmother. Witch of a woman.

27:08.320 --> 27:10.520
The more I get to know you,
the more I'm starting to understand.

27:10.620 --> 27:12.180
- Huh?
- Nothing.

27:12.290 --> 27:15.320
- Do you know what's strange, Daniel?
- No.

27:15.430 --> 27:19.830
She has the knowledge of ascended
beings, twisted though it may be,

27:19.930 --> 27:23.060
but I sense that there is a part of her
that is just like any other kid

27:23.170 --> 27:24.660
that wants her mother's approval.

27:24.770 --> 27:26.670
So I'm hoping I can use that somehow.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.140
I mean, why else would
she care what I think?

27:28.240 --> 27:30.710
Right now, we're a little more concerned
about getting off this ship.

27:30.810 --> 27:32.400
- There's only so long I can hide.
- Hide!

27:32.510 --> 27:33.770
- Yeah.
- Hide!

27:33.880 --> 27:34.970
(COUGHS)

27:36.780 --> 27:38.080
- (COUGHING) Hi.
- What?

27:38.180 --> 27:41.310
- Hi. Long day?
- Ah, I'm exhausted.

27:42.860 --> 27:44.910
I see you're up and around.

27:45.160 --> 27:46.220
(GRUNTS)

27:46.330 --> 27:48.050
Much better.

27:57.300 --> 27:59.330
Three more ships just emerged
from hyperspace.

27:59.440 --> 28:03.200
- They're flanking us.
- Receiving hail. On screen.

28:04.410 --> 28:07.240
<i>- Greetings.</i>
- Bra'tac. Greetings back at you.

28:07.350 --> 28:10.010
Heads up, the Lucian Alliance
is getting ready to open fire on us.

28:10.120 --> 28:14.020
<i>I have already demanded that</i>
<i>they stand down or face us in battle.</i>

28:14.120 --> 28:15.140
They're firing weapons.

28:21.730 --> 28:24.250
- What the hell are they doing?
- Carter, now or never.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.120
I have a lock.

28:34.370 --> 28:37.210
Bridge, we have Teal'c. Are you okay?

28:38.040 --> 28:39.810
I have been better.

28:40.350 --> 28:43.040
Medical team to Auxiliary Control Room 2.

28:46.620 --> 28:48.550
I guess we've all had enough fighting
for one day.

28:48.650 --> 28:50.650
They just didn't want us to be able to
salvage the ship

28:50.760 --> 28:52.850
when they turned tail and ran.

28:53.460 --> 28:55.760
After everything you've been through,
after everything you've seen,

28:55.860 --> 28:57.800
how can you still not believe in the Ori?

28:57.900 --> 28:59.190
You think I don't?

28:59.300 --> 29:01.100
The Orici is a truthseer.

29:01.200 --> 29:04.030
She is a child. Little girls always have
issues with their mothers.

29:04.140 --> 29:05.870
Are you saying you do believe in the Ori?

29:05.970 --> 29:08.840
Why are you here with me
if you doubt my devotion?

29:08.940 --> 29:10.530
Because I love you.

29:12.510 --> 29:15.450
Because I'm still hoping
I can save your soul.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.050
What? Where are you going?

29:28.160 --> 29:29.460
I'm called to duty.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.860
And here I was hoping I could save him.

29:38.570 --> 29:39.590
(SIGHS)

29:45.480 --> 29:47.540
I am glad to see you alive.

29:47.650 --> 29:49.340
It is good to be alive, old friend.

29:49.450 --> 29:51.440
We just got some bad news.

29:52.220 --> 29:54.280
The Ori ships have been located.

29:55.150 --> 29:59.450
Moments ago, they emerged
from hyperspace over Chulak.

30:42.670 --> 30:43.760
Why Chulak?

30:43.870 --> 30:48.070
Perhaps because it is where the
Jaffa rebellion against the Goa'uld began.

30:48.170 --> 30:50.840
No matter. We must not abandon them.

30:50.940 --> 30:54.140
Well, as soon as we get our hyperdrive
back, we have to head to Earth for repairs.

30:54.250 --> 30:56.680
Someone's got to stick around,
keep an eye on that supergate.

30:56.780 --> 30:58.750
We may not be able to stop the Ori ships
from coming through,

30:58.850 --> 31:00.980
but we should at least know if they do.

31:01.090 --> 31:04.950
We will leave a small contingent
in a cloaked scout ship behind.

31:05.060 --> 31:07.030
Can you expect backup?

31:07.130 --> 31:11.560
It is unlikely.
The remaining Jaffa fleet defends Dakara.

31:11.660 --> 31:12.720
You've only got three motherships.

31:12.830 --> 31:16.700
We had a lot more than that here
and we couldn't stop them.

31:16.800 --> 31:20.330
We cannot merely stand by
while our brothers and sisters fall.

31:21.970 --> 31:25.210
- Sam, I'm going with them.
- Me, too.

31:25.310 --> 31:27.140
It's suicide.

31:27.250 --> 31:30.150
Well, for Teal'c and Bra'tac, that's
not really an argument against going.

31:30.250 --> 31:32.410
EMERSON: What about you?

31:32.520 --> 31:34.310
However remote, there is still a chance

31:34.420 --> 31:37.010
that Daniel's alive on board
one of those Ori ships.

31:37.120 --> 31:39.920
- He may need our help.
- You really believe that?

31:40.030 --> 31:42.260
You don't know him like we do.

31:44.500 --> 31:45.990
Good luck.

32:02.410 --> 32:05.080
Looks like a ground incursion
is about to begin.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.650
We're on Chulak.

32:12.190 --> 32:14.020
With most of the warriors out there
fighting Jaffa,

32:14.130 --> 32:15.820
we might be able to get off
this ship undetected.

32:15.930 --> 32:17.230
We have an opportunity here.

32:17.330 --> 32:20.090
Yes. I was thinking that, but we don't
know what powers that child might have.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.530
She is the key to the whole invasion.

32:21.630 --> 32:25.400
If we could somehow capture her,
take her with us, turn her against the Ori,

32:25.500 --> 32:28.060
then she would become the most powerful
weapon we could have against them.

32:28.170 --> 32:29.800
- That's a big if.
- What have you got?

32:29.910 --> 32:31.430
- Nothing.
- Worth a try, then?

32:33.110 --> 32:35.550
You're going to need a better disguise.

32:38.280 --> 32:40.050
I know where the armory is.

32:40.850 --> 32:42.910
They have stun weapons like Zat guns.

32:43.020 --> 32:46.080
I'll distract her
while you sneak up and stun her.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.030
It's kind of a skeleton crew on board.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.630
How many more Jaffa
do you have on the other ships?

32:58.740 --> 33:00.400
Not many.

33:00.510 --> 33:04.200
Getting the council to relinquish
three Ha'tak was difficult enough.

33:04.310 --> 33:06.830
The crew I had to assemble personally.

33:06.950 --> 33:11.310
So we're outmatched in manpower,
firepower and technology.

33:11.420 --> 33:13.580
Do we have any sort of battle strategy,
or are we just planning on

33:13.690 --> 33:17.120
dropping out of hyperspace
and getting our asses kicked again?

33:18.820 --> 33:21.020
Hey, I'm all about noble death.

33:21.760 --> 33:23.820
Pointless noble death, on the other hand...

33:23.930 --> 33:27.060
The <i>Korolev</i> log indicated that
they were attempting to use the rings

33:27.170 --> 33:29.360
to get a nuke through a fluctuation
in the Ori ship's shields

33:29.470 --> 33:31.770
that was coinciding with the firing
of their main weapons.

33:31.870 --> 33:34.000
Great. So we'll use the other two ships
to draw their fire,

33:34.110 --> 33:37.560
while we sneak around the backside
and jam a big old nuke up their tailpipe.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.200
But we don't have any nukes.

33:39.310 --> 33:40.840
You have any fancy Jaffa bombs?

33:40.950 --> 33:43.310
We have explosives
that should be effective.

33:43.420 --> 33:45.580
All right.
As soon as we drop out of hyperspace,

33:45.680 --> 33:47.880
I'll start broadcasting
on all radio channels.

33:47.990 --> 33:50.510
If Daniel's still alive, hopefully
he'll get the message that we're here

33:50.620 --> 33:52.890
and he can ring aboard.

33:52.990 --> 33:54.220
There you go.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.590
Now we got a plan.

34:01.100 --> 34:04.730
You know, if she's anything like the Priors,
she may have powers like them.

34:04.840 --> 34:07.360
That's why I'll go in first, try and get
her back turned toward the door,

34:07.470 --> 34:09.000
so she doesn't see you coming.

34:09.110 --> 34:10.670
Now, you've learned that
the Priors need to be focused

34:10.780 --> 34:11.900
in order for their powers to work,

34:12.010 --> 34:14.840
so when you hear the catchphrase,
come in firing,

34:14.950 --> 34:16.910
and anyone else in the room
shouldn't be a problem.

34:17.020 --> 34:19.420
Now, you're sure this thing just stuns?

34:19.520 --> 34:23.780
The staff thing kills, that's less potent,

34:23.890 --> 34:28.450
but if you shoot that at someone
several times, it will probably kill.

34:42.640 --> 34:45.910
Adria? It's me.

34:47.150 --> 34:48.440
Come in, Mother.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.750
Are you all right?

35:03.060 --> 35:05.220
Why are you sitting here alone
in the dark?

35:07.270 --> 35:08.430
(NERVOUS CHUCKLING)

35:09.700 --> 35:12.800
The knowledge in my mind
is growing as I am.

35:12.900 --> 35:16.740
It's a lot to take in.
It makes my head ache.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.740
I can imagine.

35:22.380 --> 35:26.840
Actually, no, I can't.
But I'm sure it's rough.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.490
It's chasing them.

35:39.330 --> 35:41.660
Moving into flanking position.

35:50.010 --> 35:51.700
What are you doing?

35:53.710 --> 35:55.610
Looking out on Chulak.

35:56.580 --> 35:59.240
Are you interested in the planet
you're conquering?

36:01.120 --> 36:02.920
Have you been here before?

36:03.760 --> 36:04.920
Once.

36:06.190 --> 36:07.850
What do you know of the Jaffa?

36:07.960 --> 36:12.560
They are proud people,
confused about the ways to salvation.

36:13.100 --> 36:17.870
They have been misled by parasites
posing as gods for many generations,

36:17.970 --> 36:23.640
but in their hearts, I believe they know
ascension is the true goal of our existence.

36:23.740 --> 36:25.710
Then why are you slaughtering them?

36:29.280 --> 36:31.080
This is Lieutenant Colonel
Samantha Carter

36:31.180 --> 36:34.580
calling any survivors of the
Earth ship <i>Korolev.</i> Please come in.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.620
<i>ON RADIO: Repeat. This is</i>
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter</i>

36:39.720 --> 36:42.120
<i>calling any survivors of</i>
<i>the Earth ship</i> Korolev.

36:42.230 --> 36:43.690
<i>Please come in.</i>

36:43.800 --> 36:45.290
Sam, it's me, Daniel.

36:47.030 --> 36:48.520
Daniel, I knew you made it!

36:48.630 --> 36:49.600
Yeah. It's good to hear you, too.

36:49.700 --> 36:51.730
Listen, I'm kind of in the
middle of something right now.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.240
We're in orbit trying to blow up
one of the Ori ships.

36:54.340 --> 36:56.100
Yeah. I'm on one of the ships
that's landed on the planet.

36:56.210 --> 36:59.270
I'm gonna have to tell you the rest later.
Requesting radio silence.

37:09.850 --> 37:12.980
I am detecting the fluctuation
in their shields.

37:13.090 --> 37:14.790
Almost in range.

37:15.260 --> 37:17.850
The good news is
I just made contact with Daniel.

37:18.730 --> 37:22.170
<i>We were right. He's alive and on board</i>
<i>the Ori ship that's landed on the planet.</i>

37:22.270 --> 37:24.100
Hallelujah. What's the bad news?

37:24.970 --> 37:26.840
We just lost one of our motherships.

37:26.940 --> 37:30.310
If our plan doesn't work,
this will be a very short battle.

37:30.410 --> 37:31.600
We are in range.

37:31.710 --> 37:34.340
<i>CARTER: Now. They're firing. Send it.</i>

37:44.160 --> 37:46.090
It should have gone off by now.

37:50.760 --> 37:52.960
They must embrace their destiny.

37:54.330 --> 37:57.200
Well, then, hallowed are the Ori.

37:57.300 --> 37:58.390
Please, Mother.

37:58.500 --> 38:01.270
It is blasphemous for an unbeliever
to speak those words.

38:01.370 --> 38:04.870
No, really, you're starting
to make sense to me now.

38:04.980 --> 38:07.500
I'm really coming around.

38:07.610 --> 38:10.170
Hallowed are the Ori.

38:38.180 --> 38:39.910
We just lost another mothership.

38:40.010 --> 38:41.950
Let's get Jackson on board
and get the hell out of here.

38:42.050 --> 38:45.710
I am sorry, Colonel Mitchell.
That is not the plan.

38:49.790 --> 38:51.020
Bra'tac, what are you doing?

38:51.120 --> 38:53.150
I believe he intends to ram
the enemy vessel.

38:53.260 --> 38:56.560
Yeah, I got that. But that will kill us.

38:56.660 --> 38:58.290
- I think he knows that.
- Indeed.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.920
Teal'c, this is crazy.
Not the good kind of crazy. You know that.

39:01.030 --> 39:02.470
What would you have me do,
Colonel Mitchell?

39:02.570 --> 39:04.090
Talk to him.

39:05.700 --> 39:09.200
Chances are we'll just impact the shield.
We won't do any damage to them.

39:09.310 --> 39:12.040
What do you think,
you're making some kind of a statement?

39:12.140 --> 39:14.410
Hey, I know this is your ship
and we didn't have to come along,

39:14.510 --> 39:15.740
and maybe it is better to die in battle.

39:15.850 --> 39:18.150
I don't know.
I was never really hoping to find out.

39:18.250 --> 39:19.910
But I do know one thing.

39:20.020 --> 39:23.950
There's no point in dying
when you're going to lose anyway,

39:24.060 --> 39:25.650
not when you have a choice.

39:33.060 --> 39:36.120
- They were conspiring against you.
- Yes, I know.

39:36.230 --> 39:38.530
- Kill him.
- No!

39:39.840 --> 39:41.100
Wait.

39:42.040 --> 39:43.740
- We want to talk to you.
- Move!

39:43.840 --> 39:47.300
- I said, kill him.
- No!

39:48.950 --> 39:50.110
Mother.

39:52.820 --> 39:53.940
(GASPING)

40:01.860 --> 40:04.230
You couldn't have waited
until she'd finished healing me?

40:04.330 --> 40:06.760
Well, she was distracted.

40:06.870 --> 40:09.730
- Leave me. Grab her.
- Oh, yeah, like that's going to happen.

40:19.410 --> 40:21.850
Colonel Mitchell, Colonel Carter,
this is Emerson. Come in.

40:21.950 --> 40:23.710
<i>What's your status?</i>

40:23.820 --> 40:24.800
Beam us on board.

40:24.920 --> 40:27.580
Enemy ships have detected our presence.
Moving into range.

40:27.690 --> 40:29.920
You should have
four beacons transmitting.

40:30.020 --> 40:33.680
I planted one on you earlier, just in case.

40:36.730 --> 40:38.030
Do it.

41:03.320 --> 41:04.550
No!

41:29.580 --> 41:32.180
We were lucky the ship on the planet
had lowered its shields.

41:32.280 --> 41:34.310
You should have grabbed for Adria,
not me.

41:34.420 --> 41:36.820
No, I'm thinking I should have shot her
when I had the chance.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.480
Daniel, you couldn't have killed a child.

41:39.590 --> 41:42.290
She's not a child.
She's an Ori in the body of a human.

41:42.390 --> 41:44.290
Isn't that cheating?

41:44.400 --> 41:46.420
Well, Orlin broke the rules
by taking human form

41:46.530 --> 41:47.960
and telling us the truth about the Ori.

41:48.070 --> 41:49.900
Yeah, and he paid for that.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.940
No offense, but I think
this kid's going to be a big problem.

41:55.170 --> 41:57.200
She'll be fully grown
within a matter of days.

41:57.310 --> 41:58.430
See? Cheating.

41:58.540 --> 41:59.840
Yeah, I gotta admit,
the ascended rulebook

41:59.940 --> 42:01.940
is getting a little hard to understand.

42:02.050 --> 42:03.640
You know, I don't think there really is one.

42:03.750 --> 42:05.910
There usually never are rules in a war.

42:06.020 --> 42:08.850
Unfortunately, right now, there is no war.

42:10.960 --> 42:13.450
In a war, you've got two sides fighting.

42:13.560 --> 42:16.490
All we have is a lot of winning
by the bad guys.

42:16.590 --> 42:18.930
They have troops and ships
in our territory,

42:19.030 --> 42:21.360
and a supergate to bring in more
anytime they need them.

42:21.470 --> 42:23.400
I remember
when we first opened the gate.

42:23.500 --> 42:25.560
The Goa'uld had total domination
over the galaxy.

42:25.670 --> 42:28.870
They had massive technological
superiority over us.

42:28.970 --> 42:31.000
A lot of people didn't think
we had a chance.

42:31.110 --> 42:33.270
I'm not saying we should give up.

42:33.380 --> 42:35.350
I'll fight to my dying breath.

42:37.720 --> 42:39.740
I just think we need a new plan.

42:45.260 --> 42:46.850
A damn good one.
