WEBVTT

00:01.058 --> 00:02.037
There are two kinds of folks

00:02.064 --> 00:03.664
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:03.998 --> 00:05.724
psychopaths
and mystery writers.

00:06.062 --> 00:07.084
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:07.185 --> 00:07.885
Who am I?

00:07.974 --> 00:09.113
I'm Rick Castle.

00:09.114 --> 00:09.514
Castle.

00:09.548 --> 00:10.208
Castle.

00:10.209 --> 00:12.209
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:12.455 --> 00:14.645
Every writer needs  inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:14.755 --> 00:15.574
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:15.609 --> 00:16.629
- Beckett.
- Beckett.

00:16.664 --> 00:18.570
- Nikki Heat?
- The character he's basing on you.

00:18.616 --> 00:20.102
And thanks to my friendship
with the mayor,

00:20.103 --> 00:21.103
I get to be on her case.

00:21.137 --> 00:23.080
I would be happy
to let you spank me.

00:23.115 --> 00:23.991
And together, we catch killers

00:24.939 --> 00:25.927
We make a pretty
good team, you know?

00:26.028 --> 00:27.028
Like Starsky and Hutch.

00:27.162 --> 00:27.856
Turner and Hooch.

00:27.957 --> 00:29.557
You do remind me
a little of Hooch.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.897 --> 00:51.472
Tell me, seer,

00:51.506 --> 00:55.085
What do I hold
in my hand now?

00:55.120 --> 00:56.560
shh.

00:56.594 --> 00:58.534
You're holding...

01:00.310 --> 01:01.746
A wallet.

01:01.781 --> 01:04.691
Yes! Incredible.
Ten out of ten.

01:04.726 --> 01:06.231
What's going on?

01:06.266 --> 01:07.577
Gram's teaching me
how to read minds.

01:07.978 --> 01:09.478
And she is a natural.

01:09.611 --> 01:10.954
Much better than you were
at her age.

01:10.955 --> 01:11.955
And I'm very proud.

01:12.488 --> 01:14.896
Why the sudden foray
into the mysterious realms?

01:14.930 --> 01:17.637
It's a genealogy project for
school. Half of the assignment

01:17.673 --> 01:19.610
is to collect stories
from family members.

01:19.644 --> 01:21.582
I had no idea
that gram's folks

01:21.617 --> 01:23.527
had a mind-reading act
on Coney Island.

01:23.528 --> 01:25.328
Yeah, they were
very famous in their day.

01:25.761 --> 01:27.633
I love all their codes--
how "tell me" means wallet

01:27.667 --> 01:30.475
and "reveal to me"
means a pair of glasses.

01:30.509 --> 01:32.447
Yes, you come from
a long line

01:32.481 --> 01:34.352
of hucksters and charlatans,
myself included.

01:34.386 --> 01:36.391
But we have high hopes
for you.

01:38.430 --> 01:40.400
That must be Beckett.

01:40.435 --> 01:42.072
How did you know?

01:42.106 --> 01:45.012
It's after 10:00
on a weekday.

01:45.047 --> 01:46.950
Who else is it gonna be?

01:46.985 --> 01:48.424
Oh, she is good.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.025
Brilliant.

01:50.058 --> 01:51.360
Castle.

01:51.395 --> 01:53.165
I knew it was you.

01:53.199 --> 01:55.203
Victim is
a hispanic male, mid-30s.

01:55.237 --> 01:58.243
A local spotted him
when he was out walking s dog,

01:58.277 --> 01:59.980
around 10:30.

02:00.014 --> 02:01.917
His wallet's missing.
If it was a robbery,

02:01.952 --> 02:05.057
I bet my week's salary that the killer
didn't know who he was rolling.

02:05.091 --> 02:07.395
You I.D.'ed him
without a wallet?

02:07.430 --> 02:09.466
Unfortunately.
You know the guy?

02:09.501 --> 02:12.172
Everybody in New York
knows the guy.

02:12.207 --> 02:14.743
Cano Vega,
the baseball player.

02:15.078 --> 02:17.081
Yep.
Cano Vega?
Are you sure?

02:17.115 --> 02:18.284
He was
my first-round draft pick

02:18.319 --> 02:19.957
in my fantasy league
three years running.

02:20.391 --> 02:24.496
.314 batting average,
4 gold gloves, and one...

02:25.330 --> 02:27.200
championship ring.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.604
I almost caught one of
his homers once.

02:29.639 --> 02:30.942
He had just came
to the states from Cuba,

02:31.076 --> 02:33.483
and my dad took us out
to the bleachers over at Shea.

02:33.484 --> 02:34.784
I didn't know
you were a baseball fan.

02:34.817 --> 02:36.953
It's genetic,
on my dad's side.

02:37.488 --> 02:39.360
Been taking me to games
since I was 3.

02:39.361 --> 02:40.761
Yeah, mine, too.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.264
What about you, Castle?

02:43.298 --> 02:44.301
Your dad a baseball fan?

02:44.435 --> 02:45.540
I really can't say.

02:45.541 --> 02:47.341
Castle is
famously fatherless.

02:47.774 --> 02:48.544
What, are you adopted
or something?

02:48.545 --> 02:49.345
No.

02:49.379 --> 02:51.581
Then how do you--
it's complicated.

02:51.616 --> 02:53.017
It's not <i>that</i> complicated.

02:53.052 --> 02:54.789
Someone used his head
for batting practice.

02:55.123 --> 02:57.191
36-ouncer to the back
of the head.

02:57.225 --> 02:59.429
By the look of the spatter,
he was hit multiple times.

02:59.430 --> 03:00.430
Time of death?

03:00.564 --> 03:02.867
Uh, from his temperature,
I'd say two,

03:02.902 --> 03:04.439
maybe three hour
at the most.

03:04.540 --> 03:05.740
What's with
all this bruising?

03:06.274 --> 03:07.747
Postmortem,
from the balls.

03:07.848 --> 03:10.548
Pitching arm--it ran
for a while after he was dead.

03:10.881 --> 03:12.616
So you'd think a guy
like Cano Vega

03:12.651 --> 03:14.754
would have a batting cage
in his basement.

03:15.188 --> 03:17.824
What would he be doing
in a sketchy neighborhood

03:17.858 --> 03:20.495
in Spanish Harlem
at this hour of the night?

03:20.830 --> 03:23.099
Maybe because
it's Cano Vega Field.

03:23.133 --> 03:25.536
Local uniforms said that
he built it for the community,

03:25.570 --> 03:27.205
wanted to
give something back.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.908
So our killer

03:28.943 --> 03:31.345
hit him from here.

03:31.379 --> 03:34.016
And he got blood
on his shoe.

03:34.050 --> 03:35.953
Have C.S.U. run a sweep.

03:35.987 --> 03:36.458
See if anything tracked
outside of the field.

03:36.459 --> 03:37.459
All right.

03:37.992 --> 03:42.329
So your dad, what is it,
a "Mamma Mia!" thing?

03:42.364 --> 03:44.366
Early '70s, free love.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.537
Yeah, I'll bet your mom was
kinda wild back in the day.

03:46.572 --> 03:48.110
You really need
to stop talking now.

03:48.211 --> 03:49.511
Sorry. Done.

03:54.015 --> 03:55.182
A big, athletic guy

03:55.217 --> 03:58.287
is swinging
a 2-1/2-foot club.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.460
He couldn't have been
that easy to kill.

03:59.961 --> 04:01.661
Unless he didn't
see it coming.

04:02.294 --> 04:04.196
On behalf
of the Vega family...

04:04.230 --> 04:06.267
I want to thank
all of Cano's loyal fans

04:06.302 --> 04:08.304
for their love and support.

04:08.338 --> 04:10.507
In this time of great sadness,

04:10.541 --> 04:12.708
we ask that you please respect
his family's privacy.

04:12.709 --> 04:13.709
Mr. Fox who else is...

04:14.743 --> 04:16.276
12 years of marriage--

04:16.310 --> 04:17.877
All they want from me
is a sound bite.

04:17.911 --> 04:20.313
I'm very sorry
about your loss, Mrs. Vega.

04:20.346 --> 04:22.084
Do you know why he'd be
in the park last night?

04:22.885 --> 04:24.685
Sometimes he'd go there
to blow off steam,

04:25.218 --> 04:26.420
but never at night.

04:26.421 --> 04:28.021
Do you know where he was
earlier in the evening?

04:28.255 --> 04:29.622
He was at my club.

04:29.623 --> 04:30.623
Thanks.

04:31.057 --> 04:32.090
Detective Beckett,
Mr. Castle,

04:32.125 --> 04:33.859
Tommy Zane--
Cano's old teammate.

04:33.993 --> 04:35.127
Be hard to be a New Yorker
and not know

04:35.161 --> 04:36.463
Freight Train Tommy Zane.

04:36.564 --> 04:37.964
So you guys got any leads?

04:38.097 --> 04:39.934
We're looking into it.
Mr. Zane, you said

04:39.968 --> 04:42.103
that Mr. Vega was
at your club last night?

04:42.104 --> 04:43.304
Our club, actually.

04:43.437 --> 04:45.172
Cano and I owned it with
a couple of other players.

04:45.173 --> 04:46.173
Do you know about what time?

04:46.306 --> 04:48.874
Dropped by about 7:00.
Left about 7:30.

04:48.908 --> 04:50.243
I didn't really see him.
I was with a friend.

04:52.277 --> 04:54.378
Excuse me. Yeah.

04:54.413 --> 04:55.447
Mrs. Vega,
do you know of anyone

04:55.481 --> 04:57.016
who would've wanted
to hurt your husband?

04:57.117 --> 04:59.017
Used to be,
everybody loved him,

04:59.750 --> 05:01.518
Especially
in the Cuban community.

05:01.552 --> 05:02.587
What changed?

05:02.588 --> 05:03.588
The trip.

05:04.621 --> 05:05.955
A-a few months ago,

05:05.989 --> 05:08.090
the Cuban tourism department
approached him.

05:08.125 --> 05:10.893
They wanted Cano to be
the poster boy for the new Cuba.

05:10.961 --> 05:12.895
You risk your life
to escape Castro's Cuba,

05:12.930 --> 05:14.364
why would you
go back to visit?

05:14.398 --> 05:15.299
While Cano was down there,

05:15.333 --> 05:18.968
the locals treated him
like a hero--their hero.

05:19.203 --> 05:21.804
At a state dinner, Castro
came over and shook his hand.

05:21.939 --> 05:24.140
When he got home, his friends
called him a traitor for going,

05:24.175 --> 05:25.775
said he was
a lapdog for Fidel.

05:26.510 --> 05:28.412
The same people who cheered
when he built that ballpark

05:28.446 --> 05:29.614
came up and told him
to go to hell.

05:29.615 --> 05:30.615
Did he get any threats?

05:30.649 --> 05:33.751
You bet he got threats,
hundreds of them,

05:34.585 --> 05:37.420
and all of them
courtesy of Alfredo Quintana.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.557
Detective, Bobby Fox,
Cano's agent.

05:39.558 --> 05:40.558
Nice to meet you.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.626
Detective, could you do
something to get those jackals

05:42.660 --> 05:44.796
and their cameras
away from Mrs. Vega's house?

05:44.797 --> 05:45.797
I'll see what I can do.

05:46.130 --> 05:48.265
Thanks.
Who's Alfredo Quintana?

05:48.300 --> 05:50.635
He's the guy
who killed Cano Vega.

05:52.770 --> 05:53.870
Thanks, Carlos.

05:54.404 --> 05:56.272
Hey.

05:56.607 --> 05:58.207
Alfredo Quintana--

05:58.241 --> 06:01.940
J.D., Phd and editor
of "Una Nueva Esperanza,"

06:02.074 --> 06:04.175
a newspaper published by
his foundation,

06:04.209 --> 06:05.675
primarily
for the Cuban community.

06:05.809 --> 06:07.409
This is his column
from two weeks ago.

06:07.510 --> 06:09.310
"Cano Vega must pay"?

06:09.344 --> 06:11.644
The article's about how Vega
betrayed the Cuban community

06:11.678 --> 06:13.377
by shaking hands
with the monster

06:13.412 --> 06:15.045
who butchered thousands
of their relatives.

06:15.579 --> 06:17.645
Quintana says, "if Vega
is going to embrace

06:17.679 --> 06:20.044
"the brutal regime
he once escaped,

06:20.112 --> 06:24.146
he would do well to be reminded
of its barbarous cruelty."

06:24.180 --> 06:26.280
Well, that sounds
like a threat to me.

06:27.115 --> 06:28.080
I wasn't threatening him.

06:28.115 --> 06:31.948
You turned the local
Cuban community against him.

06:31.982 --> 06:33.281
He turned his back
on his people

06:33.315 --> 06:35.316
when he gave Castro
his nod of approval.

06:35.350 --> 06:38.218
If you want me to be sorry about
what I wrote because he's dead,

06:38.253 --> 06:39.753
I'm not.

06:39.787 --> 06:41.287
I wrote the truth.

06:41.322 --> 06:43.222
Are you sure
that's all you did?

06:43.257 --> 06:45.257
You said it yourself
in your editorial,

06:45.291 --> 06:46.692
Vega should pay.

06:46.726 --> 06:47.726
It's a free country,
isn't it?

06:49.461 --> 06:51.127
I'm entitled
to express my opinion.

06:51.162 --> 06:53.262
Your foundation--
Cubans First--

06:53.296 --> 06:55.198
is on East 98th Street.

06:55.632 --> 06:57.067
That's three blocks away

06:57.101 --> 06:59.402
from the field
where Vega's body was found.

06:59.436 --> 07:01.438
You think I had something
to do with his murder?

07:01.472 --> 07:03.740
Well, the pen is mightier
than the sword.

07:03.775 --> 07:06.042
But a baseball bat can be
pretty effective, too.

07:06.077 --> 07:08.445
Where were you last night
between 7:00 and 10:00 pm?

07:08.546 --> 07:10.246
I was at home with my wife.

07:10.279 --> 07:12.880
Mm. Wives make
such convenient alibis.

07:13.115 --> 07:14.549
My sons
were there as well...

07:15.784 --> 07:17.250
as well as my brother.

07:17.685 --> 07:18.286
Do you have anyone
who isn't blood related?

07:20.020 --> 07:21.621
A notary, perhaps?

07:22.156 --> 07:25.391
Look, what Cano Vega did
is inexcusable.

07:26.426 --> 07:28.660
But I am not a murderer.

07:28.694 --> 07:30.428
Are you sure about that,
Mr. Quintana?

07:30.563 --> 07:33.131
You incited an entire community
against him.

07:34.065 --> 07:35.565
So from where I'm standing,

07:35.599 --> 07:37.533
you might not have swung
that bat,

07:37.567 --> 07:40.402
but that doesn't mean
that you didn't kill him.

07:44.774 --> 07:46.074
Well?
We'll check his alibi...

07:46.075 --> 07:47.644
but my gut tells me
it's not him.

07:47.645 --> 07:49.145
We should get a warrant,
run his subscribers

07:49.178 --> 07:51.013
against any hate mail that
the Vegas might have gotten.

07:51.014 --> 07:53.214
You sure you got no cop
in the Castle family tree?

07:53.247 --> 07:53.947
No, us Castles

07:53.982 --> 07:55.749
are mostly con artists
and circus folk, sir.

07:55.784 --> 07:57.485
No, I think there's
a little cop in there somewhere.

08:00.420 --> 08:01.287
Con artists

08:01.321 --> 08:01.955
and circus people, huh?

08:02.089 --> 08:03.356
Yep, and mind readers.

08:03.390 --> 08:06.657
Really? So tell me
what I'm thinking.

08:06.692 --> 08:07.959
aah.

08:07.993 --> 08:10.693
You're... You're thinking...

08:10.727 --> 08:13.196
You don't care and you want me
to stop talking.

08:13.530 --> 08:15.297
Ooh, that's uncanny.

08:15.332 --> 08:16.199
It's in the blood.
Yo, Beckett.

08:16.234 --> 08:18.068
Yeah.
Just got back from C.S.U.

08:19.002 --> 08:21.070
They managed to track the blood
trail from the killer's shoe

08:21.103 --> 08:23.804
across the park.
It dead-ended at the curb.

08:23.939 --> 08:25.374
So our killer
was driving a car.

08:25.375 --> 08:26.775
Yeah. The area
was a little muddy,

08:26.808 --> 08:28.642
so we were able to pull
a partial on the tire.

08:28.643 --> 08:29.643
Any make and model?

08:29.877 --> 08:31.744
Better. The tire marks
are distinctive.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.044
They've been patched
in two spots.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.647
Now those same tire tracks
match a car that was tagged

08:35.682 --> 08:37.582
in an aggravated assault
last year.

08:37.616 --> 08:39.650
The asault was committed
with a baseball bat

08:39.684 --> 08:41.285
By one Anton Wade.

08:41.287 --> 08:43.287
Loan sharking, blackmail.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.253
Plus assault with
a deadly weapon and two A&B's--

08:46.487 --> 08:48.785
Assault and battery.
I know.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.788
Right. The guy's
one seriously bad dude.

08:50.822 --> 08:54.790
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh,
I'm sensing something here--

08:54.825 --> 09:00.292
that... this guy
might just be our killer.

09:08.752 --> 09:10.186
Mr. Wade,

09:10.220 --> 09:12.188
We have you
at the baseball field.

09:12.222 --> 09:14.191
Your car
was at the crime scene,

09:14.226 --> 09:16.393
not to mention
your unfortunate history

09:16.428 --> 09:18.562
of hitting people
with baseball bats.

09:18.596 --> 09:19.597
All of that's enough
to send you away. So...

09:19.631 --> 09:23.235
you can play dumb
or you can play ball.

09:24.136 --> 09:25.236
Pun intended.

09:26.569 --> 09:28.405
All right, I was there,
but I didn't kill him.

09:28.439 --> 09:29.806
He was already dead.

09:29.841 --> 09:32.642
You were just
paying the corpse a visit.

09:32.676 --> 09:35.645
He called  and asked me
to meet up with him.

09:35.679 --> 09:38.580
And when I got there,
I knew how it looked.

09:38.615 --> 09:40.383
So I bounced the hell up
outta there.

09:40.384 --> 09:41.784
Why would Vega call you?

09:41.817 --> 09:44.185
He wanted to make a payment
on his loan.

09:44.219 --> 09:47.187
He always paid the same way,
cash in a plain envelope.

09:47.222 --> 09:49.255
I saw it on him.
I took it.

09:49.290 --> 09:51.624
The guy's a multimillionaire.
You're a petty loan shark.

09:51.691 --> 09:53.625
What's he doing
borrowing money from you?

09:53.659 --> 09:56.160
In my business,
you don't ask, you don't tell.

09:56.194 --> 09:58.328
How much money
did he borrow?

09:58.363 --> 10:00.263
He came to me
a couple weeks back,

10:00.298 --> 10:01.731
needed 200 grand.

10:01.766 --> 10:04.734
In my experience...
if you need that kind of coin,

10:04.768 --> 10:08.203
he got himself
into some real bad... trouble--

10:08.237 --> 10:10.805
The kind of trouble
that gets you killed.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.807
Or maybe
he couldn't pay your vig.

10:12.842 --> 10:15.276
And you pulled a little
"Untouchables" De Niro

10:15.310 --> 10:17.945
On his head.
A guy owing you money?

10:17.979 --> 10:21.514
Killing him ain't gonna get
you paid. You take his bling,

10:21.549 --> 10:24.383
you jack him for his ride, you
maybe even bust his kneecaps.

10:24.417 --> 10:26.418
But he made
his last installment.

10:26.452 --> 10:29.687
Vega made his vig.
We were good.

10:30.722 --> 10:33.857
Vega's wife didn't know
anything about the 200 grand.

10:33.891 --> 10:35.258
It doesn't make sense.

10:35.292 --> 10:37.260
With his assets,
a guy like Cano Vega

10:37.294 --> 10:39.862
could get a loan from any bank
in New York City.

10:39.897 --> 10:41.931
So why go to a loan shark
for $200,000?

10:41.965 --> 10:44.232
Because bank loans
take time.

10:44.267 --> 10:45.100
Loan sharks give it to you
right away.

10:45.135 --> 10:46.236
Maybe he needed
the money fast.

10:46.237 --> 10:47.537
Maybe he needed it
kept quiet.

10:47.770 --> 10:49.737
Loan sharks don't require
paperwork, credit checks.

10:49.772 --> 10:51.574
Maybe he didn't want
his wife to know.

10:52.075 --> 10:53.475
Vega didn't want his wife

10:53.508 --> 10:55.443
to know why he was
going to Cuba either.

10:55.444 --> 10:57.144
So you think his trip
and the money are related?

10:57.278 --> 10:58.411
Well, a week
after he gets back,

10:58.446 --> 11:00.479
he suddenly needs $200,000?

11:00.514 --> 11:03.515
It stands to reason that the two
were connected somehow.

11:03.549 --> 11:04.916
Yo.

11:04.951 --> 11:06.851
We just finished a search
of Wade's apartment.

11:06.886 --> 11:09.120
We found a match to
the partial shoe print.

11:09.154 --> 11:11.121
Yeah, but here's
the weird thing--

11:11.156 --> 11:13.123
it tested positive
for blood on the sole,

11:13.157 --> 11:14.525
but negative for blood
on the rest of the shoe

11:14.559 --> 11:15.727
and negative
for cleaning agents.

11:15.728 --> 11:17.028
If wade killed Vega,

11:17.061 --> 11:18.762
then his shoe would've been
covered in blood.

11:18.963 --> 11:20.063
So Wade's telling the truth.

11:20.097 --> 11:21.997
He shows up after the murder,

11:22.032 --> 11:24.066
tracks some blood
outside of the park.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.968
While the real murderer
gets blood on top of his shoe

11:28.003 --> 11:30.470
and leaves little
or no trail behind.

11:30.504 --> 11:32.371
Let's find out why Vega
comes back from Cuba

11:32.406 --> 11:34.440
and suddenly needs 200 grand.
Okay.

11:35.475 --> 11:36.243
So where do you want
to start?

11:36.244 --> 11:37.744
You guys look into
Vega's financials.

11:37.777 --> 11:38.944
See if we missed anything.

11:38.978 --> 11:40.347
Castle and I will start
with Cuba.

11:40.348 --> 11:42.048
Cuba. Good idea.

11:42.081 --> 11:44.749
I'll bring the mojitos.
You get the beach towels.

11:44.784 --> 11:46.685
Oh, I don't know, Castle.

11:46.719 --> 11:49.621
Me in a swimsuit
under the hot, blistering sun?

11:49.688 --> 11:51.756
I'd be happy
to rub lotion on you.

11:51.790 --> 11:53.557
That's okay.
I was actually thinking

11:53.592 --> 11:55.327
of something
a little bit more local...

11:55.328 --> 11:56.328
<i>...For their love</i>
<i>and support.</i>

11:56.661 --> 11:59.597
<i>In this time</i>
<i>of great sadness...</i>
Like the man who arranged
the entire trip to Cuba.

11:59.631 --> 12:02.699
Bobby Fox, his agent.
That's a good idea.

12:02.734 --> 12:05.669
But the lotion offer
still stands.

12:05.703 --> 12:08.204
No, thank you.
I have very soft hands.

12:10.774 --> 12:12.741
What is it
with professional sports?

12:12.775 --> 12:16.542
I mean, even the agencies
are on steroids.
Well, fox's client list

12:16.577 --> 12:19.044
is a veritable who's who
of star athletes.

12:19.078 --> 12:20.979
5% of their endorsements
and salaries--

12:21.013 --> 12:23.180
You could pay
for half of lower Manhattan.

12:23.214 --> 12:25.915
Did you just use the word "veritable"?
Yes, I did.

12:25.949 --> 12:27.982
Sexy.
You should hear me say
"fallacious."

12:28.016 --> 12:30.650
Bobby Fox Agency.
Please hold. Can I help you?

12:30.685 --> 12:33.687
I need to see Mr. Fox.
Do you have an appointment?

12:33.722 --> 12:36.693
I think he can squeeze me in.
Rick?

12:36.727 --> 12:39.462
Rick Castle?
Hey, skipper.

12:39.496 --> 12:41.998
I have not seen you
since the big move.

12:42.032 --> 12:44.300
How are you, Joe?
Pretty awful.

12:44.335 --> 12:46.835
I just can't believe
this whole Vega thing.
I know.

12:46.870 --> 12:49.937
It's sad. And you two
were friends. I'm--I'm sorry.

12:49.971 --> 12:51.805
Yeah, he was a great kid.

12:51.840 --> 12:54.441
Uh, he had the ability to be
a Cuban Roberto Clemente.

12:54.475 --> 12:57.376
It's just been very sad.
We're actually here to talk
to Mr. Fox about it.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.581
This is Detective Kate Beckett.
Hi.

12:59.615 --> 13:01.780
Beckett... Kate...
Detective.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.148
Thank you.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.618
Very nice meeting you.
Okay.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.486
Well, good luck on the case.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.554
And, uh, I'll say a prayer
for you guys.

13:09.588 --> 13:11.223
Thanks.

13:11.257 --> 13:14.960
By the way, say hi
to your mom for me, okay?

13:14.994 --> 13:17.061
Will do, Joe.
Okay.

13:17.096 --> 13:18.763
Smooth.

13:18.797 --> 13:21.432
That was
Joe-freakin'-Torre.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.902
I gotta call my dad.

13:23.936 --> 13:26.403
The office is over...
The off--his office is...

13:26.438 --> 13:28.672
He was a good guy--Cano.

13:28.706 --> 13:31.573
He built that field
because he wanted to give back.

13:31.607 --> 13:33.608
I think that's why he went
to Cuba.

13:33.642 --> 13:36.376
He wanted to see
if he could do something good.

13:36.411 --> 13:38.411
But I guess
things hadn't changed

13:38.446 --> 13:40.580
as much as he had hoped for.
What happened?

13:40.614 --> 13:43.482
He had spent some time
in Havana with the people.

13:43.516 --> 13:45.684
He came back pretty upset,
and he told me

13:45.718 --> 13:48.519
to give the tourism guys back
their signing bonus.

13:48.554 --> 13:51.922
First time I ever let a client
give money back.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.857
But I figured, you know,

13:53.892 --> 13:56.426
Cano was reneging
on a military dictatorship.

13:56.460 --> 13:59.529
These are not the people
you want angry at you,

13:59.563 --> 14:02.064
Especially having defected
from them 18 years ago.

14:02.098 --> 14:03.999
He risked his life to leave.

14:04.033 --> 14:07.535
Why would you want him to be
the poster boy for the new Cuba?

14:07.570 --> 14:10.037
Oh, I didn't. I was
just as surprised as anyone

14:10.072 --> 14:11.872
That he wanted to do it.

14:11.907 --> 14:14.041
After everything I did
to get him out back then?

14:14.075 --> 14:16.810
Have you heard this story?
No.

14:16.844 --> 14:19.979
You're gonna like this, Castle.
It's like one of your books.

14:20.013 --> 14:21.980
It was the '92 Olympics.

14:22.015 --> 14:24.049
The Cubans had just won gold
in Barcelona,

14:24.083 --> 14:25.550
Thanks mostly to Cano.

14:25.584 --> 14:28.419
And I wanted to get him
to the states

14:28.453 --> 14:30.087
to play in the bigs.

14:30.121 --> 14:32.289
Now convincing him
was the easy part.

14:32.323 --> 14:35.758
Getting him onto my plane,
that was the hard part.

14:35.792 --> 14:38.994
We had to get past coaches
and minders

14:39.028 --> 14:40.862
And finally...

14:40.896 --> 14:42.897
<i>El pulpo,</i>

14:42.932 --> 14:45.232
Head of State Security,

14:45.267 --> 14:48.669
Because he had his tentacles
around everybody.

14:48.703 --> 14:51.471
And just as we thought
we were home free--boom!

14:51.505 --> 14:53.339
<i>El pulpo.</i>

14:53.374 --> 14:55.407
We were caught, sunk.

14:55.442 --> 14:57.409
A firing squad,
I kid you not,

14:57.444 --> 15:00.245
was waiting for that kid
back in Havana.

15:00.279 --> 15:02.880
You know how
I got us past <i>el pulpo?</i>

15:02.915 --> 15:05.516
Rolex.

15:05.550 --> 15:08.385
I gave him
my shiny new rolex,

15:08.419 --> 15:11.054
And he just looked
the other way.

15:11.088 --> 15:13.189
Just goes to show you,

15:13.223 --> 15:15.825
every socialist is a capitalist
when backs are turned.

15:15.859 --> 15:18.327
Is it possible
that he took the Cuba job

15:18.362 --> 15:20.663
because he needed the money?
Well, it's possible, yes.

15:20.697 --> 15:23.799
God knows those guys know
how to blow through money.

15:23.833 --> 15:26.267
and plus,
he has that club with Tommy

15:26.302 --> 15:29.971
That's just a money pit.
So in regards
to the Cuba job,

15:30.005 --> 15:33.440
who else went on this trip?
Well, a couple of
low-level Cuban diplomats.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.975
I'll have, uh, Cynthia
get you a list.

15:36.009 --> 15:38.009
So what made him
go to Cuba

15:38.044 --> 15:40.277
and then what made him
change his mind?

15:40.312 --> 15:42.812
Well, maybe Vega worked
for the state department.

15:42.847 --> 15:45.347
Maybe he was sent
to shake hands with Fidel

15:45.382 --> 15:46.815
in a secret attempt

15:46.849 --> 15:48.783
to release a biotoxin
into his system.

15:48.817 --> 15:50.851
Well, the Russians
sprayed sushi

15:50.886 --> 15:52.486
with radioactive polonium.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.587
What--
what's more farfetched?

15:54.621 --> 15:56.455
Well, I just met Joe Torre,

15:56.489 --> 15:58.456
so I guess
anything's possible.

15:58.490 --> 16:01.258
Beckett.

16:01.292 --> 16:04.361
Cause of death was cerebral
hemorrhaging, as expected.

16:04.395 --> 16:06.329
Any way to estimate
the height of the attacker

16:06.363 --> 16:09.598
based on the angle of the blows?
Normally, yes,

16:09.632 --> 16:11.533
But I-in this case,
your attacker's first swing

16:11.567 --> 16:14.704
landed a little south of his head.
How far south?

16:14.771 --> 16:16.806
E-enough to make him
a soprano.

16:16.841 --> 16:19.542
Ow. Shoulda worn a cup.

16:19.576 --> 16:21.577
Lacerations around
the patella

16:21.612 --> 16:23.847
suggest Mr. Vega
was on his knees

16:23.881 --> 16:25.849
when he was hit
on the head.

16:25.884 --> 16:29.188
So our attacker could've been anyone?
Man, woman or child.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.124
But that's not
why I called.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.693
Among all the fresh bruising,

16:33.728 --> 16:36.662
we also found
significant subdermal bruises

16:36.696 --> 16:39.731
that weren't quite as fresh.

16:39.765 --> 16:42.600
The contusions
were all fist sized.

16:42.634 --> 16:44.768
He was in a fight.

16:44.802 --> 16:46.204
Couple days ago.

16:46.239 --> 16:49.307
What's this shape right here?
He was wearing a ring.

16:49.341 --> 16:52.109
Not just any ring.

16:52.143 --> 16:53.810
A championship ring.

16:53.845 --> 16:55.778
Left-hand ring finger,

16:55.813 --> 16:57.047
just like his old teammate.

16:57.048 --> 16:59.048
Freight Train Tommy Zane.

17:02.812 --> 17:04.047
You know, mom's family
goes all the way back

17:04.082 --> 17:04.983
to the "Mayflower."

17:04.983 --> 17:06.584
What, her persecution complex
is genetic?

17:06.917 --> 17:08.917
Hey, those are my genes
you're talking about, too.

17:08.919 --> 17:10.719
Well, look on the bright side.

17:10.752 --> 17:12.853
Now that you know
you're genetically predisposed,

17:12.887 --> 17:16.821
you can seek early treatment,
prevent future outbreaks.

17:17.656 --> 17:18.190
Doesn't it bother you

17:19.424 --> 17:20.826
that you don't know
who your dad is?

17:21.827 --> 17:22.827
No.

17:23.060 --> 17:24.027
Why, does it bother you?

17:24.261 --> 17:26.229
It's like...
I have this family tree,

17:26.262 --> 17:28.364
and there's a whole chunk
of it missing.

17:28.397 --> 17:29.499
There's a whole part
of my history

17:29.534 --> 17:31.634
that doesn't even exist.

17:31.668 --> 17:33.670
I mean, really,
how could gram not know?

17:33.704 --> 17:36.705
My first year of college,
I, uh, went to a party,

17:36.740 --> 17:38.306
met this girl--Allison.

17:38.341 --> 17:41.676
In the space of six hours,
we met, we talked, we danced,

17:41.710 --> 17:43.043
we fell in love.

17:43.078 --> 17:45.112
The next morning,
she was gone.

17:45.146 --> 17:47.114
I spent a year
trying to find her,

17:47.148 --> 17:50.150
but I never learned
her last name.

17:50.184 --> 17:52.854
There's not a week that goes by
I don't think about her.

17:52.889 --> 17:55.124
Your gram told me
that she loved a lifetime

17:55.159 --> 17:56.494
the night she met him.

17:56.895 --> 17:58.895
Don't you feel like you're
missing out, not knowing?

17:59.329 --> 18:01.529
No. Oh, no. That's the beauty
of the mystery.

18:01.564 --> 18:04.532
Right now, my father
could be an astronaut,

18:04.566 --> 18:06.500
a pirate, a humanitarian,

18:06.568 --> 18:08.203
winner of the Nobel prize.

18:08.237 --> 18:10.840
I mean, what one man
could live up to all that?

18:10.841 --> 18:12.441
You think he ate whipped cream
out of a can?

18:12.574 --> 18:15.541
Yes, and he invented
whipped cream.

18:15.575 --> 18:17.142
Dad!

18:17.176 --> 18:20.045
You're gonna spoil
your dner.

18:20.079 --> 18:22.815
This is my dinner.
No.

18:22.849 --> 18:24.816
? seconds to your elevator ?

18:24.851 --> 18:26.651
? from the station ?

18:26.686 --> 18:29.086
? how can I resist
that kind of invitation? ?

18:29.120 --> 18:31.287
Mr. Zane.

18:31.322 --> 18:33.989
Detective Beckett.
Mr. Castle.

18:34.024 --> 18:36.024
You're in a festive mood
tonight, Mr. Zane.

18:36.059 --> 18:38.292
Honoring the dead?
Celebrating a life...

18:38.327 --> 18:40.127
The way Cano
would've wanted it.

18:40.161 --> 18:43.430
Yes, nothing says "I'm grieving"
like an appletini.

18:43.464 --> 18:46.399
You must be the "forgive
and forget" type, Mr. Zane,

18:46.434 --> 18:48.001
especially after that beating

18:48.035 --> 18:49.803
that you gave Cano
a couple of nights ago.

18:49.804 --> 18:50.804
What are you talking about?

18:51.138 --> 18:52.706
We found the bruises
left on Vega's body

18:52.740 --> 18:53.975
from where you hit him,

18:54.009 --> 18:55.912
Including the imprints
left by your championship ring.

18:56.513 --> 18:58.113
25 guys have this ring.

18:58.246 --> 18:59.948
Do they all wear it on
their left-hand ring finger?

18:59.949 --> 19:00.849
Some of 'em, yeah.

19:00.882 --> 19:03.050
Do they all have abrasions
on that finger

19:03.084 --> 19:05.185
that are consistent
with assault?

19:05.219 --> 19:06.386
What happened, Mr. Zane?

19:06.420 --> 19:08.488
Was Cano tired of
dumping money into this club?

19:08.522 --> 19:11.523
He didn't care about the money.
Then what was it?

19:13.526 --> 19:15.326
His wife.

19:15.361 --> 19:17.328
His wife?
You and she were--

19:17.362 --> 19:18.729
No.

19:18.763 --> 19:21.864
But he thought w--

19:21.931 --> 19:24.232
Maggie was upset,
said she thought Cano

19:24.266 --> 19:26.300
was having an affair
and wanted to know

19:26.334 --> 19:27.335
if I'd seen him down here
at the club with anybody.

19:27.336 --> 19:28.336
What'd you tell her?

19:28.470 --> 19:29.538
I told her no, of course.

19:29.539 --> 19:30.539
Was that the truth?

19:30.573 --> 19:32.409
Look, I've been
through this before.

19:32.443 --> 19:34.244
Cano was having
some kind of crisis.

19:34.278 --> 19:36.547
He wasn't gonna leave her.
So why tell her the truth?

19:36.548 --> 19:38.448
So Vega was having an affair?

19:38.481 --> 19:40.683
I'd seen him with a girl--
young, Cuban.

19:40.717 --> 19:43.218
You know, I figured after
his visit, he was missing home.

19:43.252 --> 19:45.120
Anyway, he saw me leaving
his house that night,

19:45.154 --> 19:48.221
and when he asked Maggie why I
was there, she got evasive.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.856
So naturally, he thought she was
having an affair of her own.

19:50.891 --> 19:52.190
Came after me swinging.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.192
Took a couple of shots
to his ribs

19:54.226 --> 19:56.860
to calm him down enough before
I could tell him the truth.

19:56.895 --> 19:58.329
This girl that he was dating,
do you remember her name?

19:58.330 --> 19:59.830
No, he never told me
her name.

20:00.064 --> 20:03.900
But I might have a picture
on my phone.

20:03.934 --> 20:06.134
What is it with professional
athletes and politicians

20:06.168 --> 20:08.468
that they just can't
keep it in their pants?

20:08.502 --> 20:11.636
They're just overgrown teenagers
with delicate little egos.

20:11.671 --> 20:13.772
It's not that deep.
It's just simple math.

20:13.806 --> 20:15.506
They just have
more opportunity.

20:15.541 --> 20:17.709
Well, what are you saying,
men are dogs?

20:17.743 --> 20:20.344
No. The greater the opportunity,
the greater the likelihood.

20:20.378 --> 20:22.845
Which means the two of you
have nothing to worry about.

20:22.846 --> 20:23.846
Ryan has nothing
to worry about.

20:24.079 --> 20:26.180
Hey.
Cano Vega, on the other hand...

20:26.214 --> 20:29.483
His wife said that he changed
when he got back from Cuba.

20:29.518 --> 20:31.052
Maybe it wasn't Cuba.
Maybe it was the girl.

20:31.053 --> 20:32.253
That could explain
the 200 grand.

20:32.387 --> 20:33.388
Maybe he needed it
for the girl.

20:33.389 --> 20:35.289
And why he needed to borrow
money from a loan shark

20:35.322 --> 20:36.490
without her finding out.

20:36.491 --> 20:38.091
But Maggie Vega
did find out.

20:39.225 --> 20:41.592
So she decides she's not
gonna take it anymore.

20:41.627 --> 20:42.427
She considers divorce,

20:42.495 --> 20:44.828
but thought about
the endless hours of scrutiny,

20:44.862 --> 20:46.663
The public humiliation
in the media.

20:46.664 --> 20:47.864
Not to mention
that she'd only get half.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.831
Uh, assuming
there's no prenup.

20:49.866 --> 20:52.135
But if she kills him,
she gets everything.

20:52.169 --> 20:54.205
Mm-hmm. She knows
where he's gonna be,

20:54.239 --> 20:56.006
alone, at night.

20:56.041 --> 20:57.675
She goes there.

20:57.709 --> 21:00.242
He trusts her,
lets his guard down.

21:00.277 --> 21:01.743
She moves in close.

21:01.778 --> 21:03.678
She smiles, picks up a bat,

21:03.713 --> 21:05.713
thinks of everything
that he's done to her,

21:05.748 --> 21:08.215
starts with the family jewels

21:08.283 --> 21:10.851
and ends
with the family fortune.

21:14.520 --> 21:17.156
This is crazy.
Why would I kill my husband?

21:17.190 --> 21:19.758
Because you thought
he was having an affair.

21:19.792 --> 21:21.092
You know?

21:21.127 --> 21:23.128
How?
It doesn't matter how we know.

21:23.162 --> 21:24.730
What matters is that
you didn't tell us.

21:24.831 --> 21:26.331
It was a private matter

21:26.464 --> 21:28.399
between Cano and me.
It's also motive.

21:28.433 --> 21:30.201
Mrs. Vega, where were you
on the night

21:30.235 --> 21:32.636
of your husband's murder?
At home alone.

21:32.771 --> 21:34.672
You can check
the security tapes if you want.

21:36.106 --> 21:39.041
So... it's true then?

21:39.075 --> 21:41.009
He was seeing someone else?

21:41.043 --> 21:42.445
We don't
know that for sure.

21:44.446 --> 21:45.446
I do.

21:48.882 --> 21:50.517
He was in love with her.

21:52.051 --> 21:53.252
Her name is Lara.

21:52.787 --> 21:56.689
<i>Mi cari</i>

21:56.723 --> 21:58.691
Who is she?
I don't know.

21:58.725 --> 22:01.527
I've torn this house upside down
looking for a clue.

22:01.562 --> 22:03.729
That note is the only thing
I've found.

22:03.764 --> 22:06.965
"2/16"--that's the day
before the murder.
Yeah.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.901
He went into the city that day,
didn't get home until 10:30.

22:09.935 --> 22:11.169
That's why I knew.

22:11.203 --> 22:13.671
Mrs. Vega, this woman
is possibly involved

22:13.705 --> 22:15.339
in your husband's murder.

22:15.374 --> 22:17.341
Why didn't you
tell us this before?

22:17.375 --> 22:19.342
Because I...

22:19.376 --> 22:22.110
I just didn't
want it to be true.

22:22.144 --> 22:25.280
Home security videos
confirm Mrs. Vega's story,

22:25.314 --> 22:28.282
And C.S.U. tested negative
for blood at Tommy Zane's place.

22:28.317 --> 22:30.750
Where are we
on the girl?

22:30.751 --> 22:32.551
Just finished combing through
Vega's internet records.

22:32.584 --> 22:35.686
There are no I.M's, e-mails
or internet browser searches

22:35.754 --> 22:37.456
connecting him in any way,
shape or form to a Lara.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.424
Phones are a dead end, too.

22:39.459 --> 22:42.360
No one who called or was called
by Vega in the last two months

22:42.394 --> 22:43.561
remembers him mentioning
anyone named Lara.

22:43.595 --> 22:45.596
Well, for a guy who's
supposedly in love,

22:45.630 --> 22:47.799
he doesn't do a very good job
keeping in touch with his girl.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.400
Some guys are just hopeless.

22:50.401 --> 22:51.401
Hey, honey.

22:51.534 --> 22:53.335
Yeah, I was just thinking
about you, thought I'd call you.

22:53.370 --> 22:55.737
Well, I just wanted to call
to say I miss you.

22:55.738 --> 22:58.138
Yeah.
Some guys are just pathetic.

22:58.171 --> 22:59.372
I don't know.
About 7:00.

22:59.373 --> 23:00.973
Don't be jealous.
He still loves you.

23:01.006 --> 23:02.573
Vega met with her
the day before he died,

23:02.607 --> 23:04.641
so let's put photos out
to all precincts

23:04.676 --> 23:06.743
and have uniforms canvass
the area around the field.

23:06.777 --> 23:09.145
Maybe somebody saw her
the night that he was killed.

23:09.146 --> 23:10.146
- Beckett.
- Yes, sir.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.248
How we doing
on the Cuba angle?

23:12.282 --> 23:13.751
Nothing yet. Why?

23:13.752 --> 23:15.752
Just got a call from the lieu
over in Union City, New Jersey.

23:15.786 --> 23:17.853
Vega was involved
in a shouting match

23:17.888 --> 23:20.323
at a restaurant in little Havana
with one of their regulars.

23:20.357 --> 23:21.525
Apparently the cops were
called in to break it up.

23:21.526 --> 23:23.026
Why wasn't there
an incident report?

23:23.059 --> 23:24.460
Cops kept it quiet
at the time

23:24.494 --> 23:25.895
At the request
of the Cuba consulate.

23:25.896 --> 23:26.896
Because of Vega?

23:26.930 --> 23:28.597
No, because of who Vega
was fighting with.

23:29.031 --> 23:31.833
Mario s

23:31.834 --> 23:34.134
He was one of the diplomats
that took Vega to Cuba.

23:34.167 --> 23:35.168
What did they fight about?

23:35.169 --> 23:36.669
I don't know, but seeing that
they were in Cuba together,

23:37.003 --> 23:39.203
I suggest you find out.

23:48.211 --> 23:49.311
On the night of the 17th,

23:49.346 --> 23:51.779
I was here
at the consulate.

23:52.314 --> 23:53.950
You don't really think
I killed Cano Vega, do you?

23:53.951 --> 23:56.651
Given his change of heart
in Cuba, I can't imagine

23:56.884 --> 23:58.186
That the two of you
were the best of friends.

23:58.187 --> 23:59.587
You could say the same thing

23:59.621 --> 24:00.956
about most of
the Cuban community here.

24:00.957 --> 24:02.857
Yes, but how many of them
ended up dead

24:02.990 --> 24:04.591
after fighting with you
in a restaurant?

24:04.625 --> 24:06.726
I was minding my own business.

24:06.760 --> 24:09.262
Vega was the one who decided
to pick a fight with me.

24:09.263 --> 24:10.263
Why?

24:11.097 --> 24:12.798
I was in charge
of his schedule in Cuba.

24:12.932 --> 24:15.700
I guess he didn't like to be
told what to do or where to go.

24:15.734 --> 24:17.703
Sounds like you kept him
on a pretty tight leash.

24:17.737 --> 24:20.170
We did a counterrevolutionary
the courtesy

24:20.205 --> 24:21.905
of allowing him
back on our soil.

24:22.239 --> 24:24.174
We weren't about to just
let him wander around.

24:24.608 --> 24:26.010
So you would know
better than anyone else

24:26.045 --> 24:27.579
what Vega did on his trip?

24:27.580 --> 24:28.580
That's my job.

24:28.914 --> 24:30.748
Everyone we've spoke to
about Vega

24:30.782 --> 24:32.416
says he came back from Cuba
a different man.

24:33.650 --> 24:35.151
What happened to him
down there?

24:35.185 --> 24:37.886
He was very emotional

24:37.920 --> 24:39.220
the whole time he was there--

24:39.255 --> 24:42.855
Uh, talking to the locals,
feeling sorry for them

24:42.990 --> 24:44.991
Because they were poor
and he was rich.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.826
Truth is, he felt guilty.

24:46.860 --> 24:50.061
When Vega returned,
he borrowed $200,000 in cash.

24:50.097 --> 24:52.831
Is it possiblet hat he was trying to
funnel money to the island,

24:52.866 --> 24:54.100
Help some of
the locals out, maybe?

24:54.101 --> 24:55.101
Not on my watch.

24:55.135 --> 24:56.502
Yeah, you can't have that.

24:56.936 --> 24:59.270
Rich people sharing their
wealth? That's like socialism.

24:59.305 --> 25:00.671
Please.

25:00.706 --> 25:04.541
The truth is that Cano Vega,
like all americans, was spoiled.

25:04.576 --> 25:06.444
When the poverty
was before his eyes--

25:06.578 --> 25:08.080
It's an unspeakable tragedy.

25:08.115 --> 25:11.850
And then, out of sight,
out of mind.

25:12.484 --> 25:13.818
He didn't know
that I was aware,

25:14.653 --> 25:15.386
but do you want to know

25:15.421 --> 25:17.955
the thing that interested Vega
most about Cuba?

25:19.489 --> 25:21.258
A girl.

25:21.292 --> 25:23.727
What girl?

25:23.761 --> 25:26.563
He met a lot of locals,
kissed a lot of babies.

25:26.597 --> 25:29.065
I can only assume
it was a pretty young thing

25:29.099 --> 25:31.133
he met while
he was touring the island.

25:31.167 --> 25:33.135
Do you know her name?

25:33.169 --> 25:34.736
Lara.

25:34.770 --> 25:36.072
Her name was Lara.

25:37.407 --> 25:39.875
So Vega fell in love
with a girl in Cuba.

25:40.109 --> 25:41.478
If you take S

25:41.479 --> 25:43.779
Well, he couldn't have
just pulled the name Lara

25:43.812 --> 25:44.947
out of thin air.

25:44.948 --> 25:47.348
According to the note that
the wife found, Vega and Lara

25:47.382 --> 25:49.616
were supposed to meet the night
before he was murdered.

25:49.651 --> 25:52.286
Now how are they supposed to
do that if she's stuck in Cuba?

25:52.287 --> 25:53.687
If she's stuck on the island,

25:53.720 --> 25:56.354
how did she end up in that
photo with Vega at his club?

25:56.388 --> 25:58.991
There has to be an explanation
that makes this all make sense.

25:58.992 --> 25:59.992
There is.

26:00.625 --> 26:03.559
The woman standing next to Vega
in the picture is not Lara.

26:03.693 --> 26:05.594
A resident near the ballpark
where Vega was killed

26:05.629 --> 26:08.296
I.D.'ed her.
Her names Ana, Ana Rivera.

26:08.331 --> 26:09.599
She's a waitress
in the neighborhood.

26:09.633 --> 26:10.768
Uniforms are
bringing her in now.

26:10.769 --> 26:12.469
What's her connection
to Vega?

26:13.203 --> 26:15.404
Cuba.
She escaped six months ago.

26:18.106 --> 26:20.775
We met at a bar
where I work, near his field.

26:21.309 --> 26:24.177
He heard I'd just
come over from Cuba last year,

26:24.211 --> 26:25.812
and he invited me out
for drinks.

26:25.946 --> 26:27.046
Did you know
he was married?

26:27.047 --> 26:28.047
It wasn't like that.

26:29.181 --> 26:32.715
He just wanted to talk...
about home.

26:32.750 --> 26:34.453
He missed it. I think
that's why he wanted to go.

26:34.487 --> 26:37.022
You were photographed with him
<i>after</i> the trip.

26:37.056 --> 26:39.557
Did he still want to...
just talk?

26:39.591 --> 26:42.927
Yes. He wanted to talk about
my trip here from Cuba.

26:43.061 --> 26:46.429
It was like he was obsessed.
He wanted to know how I got out.

26:46.663 --> 26:47.631
And what did you tell him?

26:50.666 --> 26:53.801
Ana, what did you tell
Mr. Vega?

26:53.835 --> 26:56.603
I said my family knew a man.

26:56.637 --> 26:59.104
If--if you pay him
lots of money,

26:59.139 --> 27:01.940
<i>Mi cari</i>

27:01.975 --> 27:03.742
<i>Mi cari</i>

27:03.776 --> 27:05.277
His boat.

27:05.311 --> 27:07.212
It takes you to Jamaica,

27:07.246 --> 27:09.747
and then you fly
to America.

27:09.815 --> 27:11.818
It's important that you fly,
because if you come by boat,

27:11.852 --> 27:13.787
then they can send you back.

27:14.822 --> 27:16.491
That's the wet-foot,
dry-foot policy.

27:16.892 --> 27:17.792
Vega was looking for a way

27:17.825 --> 27:19.627
to get his new girlfriend
out of Cuba.

27:19.661 --> 27:23.663
<i>"mi cari</i>

27:23.698 --> 27:25.532
<i>"mi cari</i>

27:25.566 --> 27:28.433
which means she arrived
on the 17th.

27:28.467 --> 27:31.002
That's the same day Vega died.
That can't be a coincidence.

27:31.036 --> 27:34.137
Ana, you told Mr. Vega
how to get in touch

27:34.172 --> 27:35.806
with the man who got you
out of Cuba.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.375
Yes. He runs a newspaper.

27:39.209 --> 27:40.977
"Una Nueva Esperanza,"

27:41.011 --> 27:42.279
on East 98th.

27:42.413 --> 27:44.481
Alfredo Quintana, the editor?

27:48.517 --> 27:52.054
He lied to us.

27:52.655 --> 27:55.390
All right, first you accuse me
of killing Vega.

27:55.424 --> 27:57.425
Then you're saying
that I'm helping him.

27:57.459 --> 27:59.493
So maybe you guys
should make up your mind.

27:59.528 --> 28:01.462
Well, actually,we made up our minds,

28:01.496 --> 28:03.798
once we saw the $200,000
in your bank account.

28:03.799 --> 28:04.799
That's the exact amount

28:04.832 --> 28:06.532
Cano Vega borrowed
from a loan shark.

28:06.633 --> 28:08.533
Since what you were doing
was illegal,

28:08.666 --> 28:09.997
he didn't want there to be
any record of it.

28:10.031 --> 28:12.030
You know, I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:18.334 --> 28:20.901
These aren't my accounts.
All right?

28:21.135 --> 28:22.102
This is
the foundation's account.

28:22.137 --> 28:23.537
My name isn't even on them.

28:23.572 --> 28:25.273
Which is why you hid
the money there,

28:25.308 --> 28:26.443
to make it harder for us
to find.

28:26.444 --> 28:28.644
These were
charitable contributions.

28:28.777 --> 28:30.581
Where's the girl?

28:30.615 --> 28:32.550
What girl?

28:32.684 --> 28:35.853
Mr. Quintana,
you and your foundation

28:35.888 --> 28:38.055
are facing
human smuggling charges.

28:38.089 --> 28:41.224
Do you really want me to add
obstruction of justice

28:41.258 --> 28:44.892
and aiding and abetting
a murderer to that?

28:44.927 --> 28:47.494
You like the press,
don't you?

28:47.529 --> 28:48.129
How are you gonna like

28:48.163 --> 28:50.729
being linked
to Cano Vega's murder?

28:50.764 --> 28:52.997
You know what they'll see?

28:53.032 --> 28:56.265
That I saved a girl
from under Castro's regime.

28:56.300 --> 28:58.101
For a price.
Yeah, I would've done it for free.

28:58.135 --> 28:59.202
Yeah, but you didn't.

29:00.237 --> 29:01.804
Are you really ready
to stake your entire future

29:01.939 --> 29:03.572
on some girl
you don't even know?

29:08.608 --> 29:12.109
Vega had
an apartment for her.

29:12.144 --> 29:14.116
I took her there
when I got her to the mainland.

29:14.117 --> 29:15.117
Where?

29:15.451 --> 29:17.022
Union City, Summit Avenue.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.291
NYPD!
NYPD!

29:19.326 --> 29:20.962
NYPD!
Police! Police!

29:21.196 --> 29:22.699
Police! Police!
NYPD! NYPD!

29:25.802 --> 29:27.102
Clear.
Clear.

29:27.137 --> 29:28.937
Clear.

29:31.873 --> 29:33.306
Looks like
nobody's home.

29:33.341 --> 29:36.109
This girl's in dire need
of a trip to Ikea.

29:36.143 --> 29:37.378
This bed
hasn't even been made.

29:37.412 --> 29:38.613
I don't think
she was sleeping here.

29:40.348 --> 29:41.381
Beckett.

29:41.415 --> 29:42.449
Yeah.

29:42.584 --> 29:43.918
Looks like dirt.

29:44.452 --> 29:45.620
Get C.S.U. down here.

29:48.289 --> 29:50.790
You guys.

29:54.261 --> 29:56.562
There's blood.

29:56.596 --> 29:58.296
It's definitely Vega's.

29:58.331 --> 29:59.566
And the footprint?

29:59.667 --> 30:02.767
That's harder to nail down.
The composition of the dirt

30:02.801 --> 30:04.669
is pretty similar to dirt
anywhere in the city.

30:04.703 --> 30:06.705
So we can't actually prove
that she was at the scene?

30:06.706 --> 30:07.706
I just said it's harder.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.774
But there were traces of
titanium dioxide in the dirt.

30:10.808 --> 30:14.110
Chalk.
Like what they use to
trace lines on baseball fields.

30:14.177 --> 30:15.746
So she heads to the field,

30:15.780 --> 30:17.714
takes a little batting practice
on Vega's head,

30:17.748 --> 30:20.250
heads home, packs her things,
hits the road.

30:20.284 --> 30:22.985
Giving a whole new meaning
to the term "hit-and-run."

30:23.320 --> 30:25.320
Beckett.
B-e-c-k-e double-t.

30:25.355 --> 30:27.455
Badge 4-1-3-1-9.

30:27.989 --> 30:31.057
I need a T.S.A. hold
on a potential fugitive.

30:31.091 --> 30:32.559
Yes, I'll hold.

30:32.593 --> 30:34.862
Uniforms are circulating
that picture of Lara

30:34.896 --> 30:35.696
we got from Quintana.

30:35.731 --> 30:37.031
They're plastering it
on every storefront

30:37.065 --> 30:39.066
within a mile of her place.
So it was the girl?

30:39.100 --> 30:41.701
Evidence looks that way.
We figure she honey trapped Vega

30:41.736 --> 30:43.036
into giving her
tickets out of Cuba,

30:43.071 --> 30:44.472
and when she got here,
he wanted a little more

30:44.506 --> 30:45.340
than she was willing to give,

30:45.374 --> 30:46.575
and things went south
from there.

30:46.576 --> 30:48.376
Maybe it was
the Cuban government all along.

30:48.710 --> 30:50.143
They hated Vega for defecting.

30:50.178 --> 30:53.078
So they send a beautiful spy
for him to fall in love with.

30:53.113 --> 30:58.179
It works. He smuggles her
back home, and bam!

30:58.113 --> 30:59.313
He's dead.

31:00.048 --> 31:01.948
Sounds like a Castle story.

31:01.982 --> 31:03.549
I'll call it
"Coraz

31:03.550 --> 31:05.350
Yes. I need
a detain and contain.

31:05.484 --> 31:07.851
All no-fly protocols.
Thank you.

31:07.886 --> 31:10.754
Though we really should
stake out the consulate.
Way ahead of you.

31:10.788 --> 31:12.855
Surveillance has been there
for about an hour.

31:12.890 --> 31:15.191
If she killed him
out of self-defense,

31:15.225 --> 31:16.462
then she'd go back
to the devil she knows.

31:16.463 --> 31:19.063
And yet I'm sensing
skepticism on my theory.

31:19.097 --> 31:20.597
Yeah, thanks.
Mind reader.

31:20.631 --> 31:23.666
Well, you're both geniuses. That
was our guys at the consulate.

31:23.700 --> 31:25.601
They just spotted Lara walking
right through the door.

31:25.635 --> 31:27.070
I don't know
what to tell you.

31:27.104 --> 31:28.639
I've never seen
that girl before.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.940
Well, then you should invest
in some corrective lenses.

31:31.574 --> 31:33.542
Our surveillance team
saw her coming in here

31:33.576 --> 31:34.410
not half an hour ago.

31:34.477 --> 31:37.246
Surveillance team?
You're watching us now?

31:37.347 --> 31:38.647
Only within
the scope of the law.

31:38.780 --> 31:41.082
The watcher
becomes the watched.

31:41.716 --> 31:43.817
I'm a big fan of irony.
Ask her.

31:43.851 --> 31:47.086
She's a Cuban citizen
requesting asylum.

31:47.120 --> 31:49.155
She's a suspect
in a murder investigation.

31:49.189 --> 31:51.223
And you expect me
just to hand her over

31:51.257 --> 31:52.492
to the American authorities?

31:52.493 --> 31:54.893
Mr. S

31:54.927 --> 31:57.128
a country's consulate
and its embassy

31:57.163 --> 31:59.663
have a different set
of rights and privileges.

32:00.197 --> 32:02.098
This is only a consulate.

32:02.132 --> 32:04.202
You do not have
diplomatic immunity.

32:07.237 --> 32:08.573
Produce the girl now

32:08.608 --> 32:11.147
or I will get a search warrant
and make a public spectacle

32:11.181 --> 32:15.552
of your government harboring
a criminal on American soil.

32:15.586 --> 32:17.553
Ouch.

32:24.626 --> 32:27.092
<i>s</i>

32:35.961 --> 32:38.029
No, I-I-I did not
kill him.

32:38.063 --> 32:40.031
please.
You have to believe
then why did you run?

32:40.099 --> 32:41.501
Why did you try
to go back to Cuba?

32:41.702 --> 32:45.002
I was afraid the man
will kill me, too.

32:45.036 --> 32:47.638
What man?
The one who come the night he died.

32:47.673 --> 32:51.674
He come to...
<i>El piso.</i>

32:51.709 --> 32:53.010
The apartment.
He came to the apartment.

32:53.011 --> 32:54.711
There was a man
who came to the apartment

32:54.744 --> 32:57.045
the night that Vega died,
and that's why you were running?

32:57.780 --> 32:59.580
He kill my father.

33:00.514 --> 33:01.414
Your father?

33:01.549 --> 33:02.282
Vega.

33:02.316 --> 33:03.883
Cano Vega is your father?

33:04.918 --> 33:06.853
O-okay, Lara, take us
from the beginning.

33:06.887 --> 33:08.355
<i>Desde del principio.</i>

33:08.389 --> 33:10.458
Vega and my mother...

33:21.503 --> 33:23.804
Vega and her mother
were engaged when he defected.

33:23.838 --> 33:27.073
She's supposed to come,
but she didn't.

33:27.108 --> 33:30.042
As punishment for what Vega did,
they threw her mother in pson.

33:30.077 --> 33:33.979
She was pregnant with her
at the time.

33:34.013 --> 33:35.313
Did Vega know about this?

33:38.516 --> 33:39.816
not until
a couple of months ago

33:39.850 --> 33:41.517
When he heard a rumor
that he had a daughter.

33:41.518 --> 33:43.318
Well, that's why Vega
went to Cuba.

33:43.452 --> 33:44.986
To see if
he really did have a daughter.

33:49.422 --> 33:50.623
They didn't actually meet

33:50.657 --> 33:52.224
because the government
was watching him.

33:52.258 --> 33:55.493
but he got her a message

33:55.528 --> 33:57.929
saying that he would get her out
as soon as he could.

33:57.963 --> 34:01.465
The first time
I meet my father was...

34:02.399 --> 34:03.500
Three nights ago,

34:03.934 --> 34:05.568
And I want to tell him

34:05.603 --> 34:08.638
how much suffering
he caused.

34:13.875 --> 34:14.509
She grew up believing

34:14.543 --> 34:16.811
that her father had abandoned
her mother to get rich.

34:16.844 --> 34:18.746
But he told her that
that wasn't true...

34:18.780 --> 34:21.148
that he only defected

34:21.181 --> 34:24.016
because her mother said that
she was going to as well.

34:24.051 --> 34:27.385
but that she had changed
her mind at the last minute.

34:28.320 --> 34:29.420
All these years,

34:29.454 --> 34:32.188
he had thought that she had
turned her back on him.

34:32.224 --> 34:34.492
He never knew that they--

34:34.726 --> 34:36.896
that the government
had made an example of him

34:36.929 --> 34:38.498
to all the other players.

34:40.335 --> 34:42.469
He never knew
that she had died in prison.

34:42.505 --> 34:44.408
My father...

34:44.442 --> 34:47.177
is very upset
when I tell him this.

34:47.212 --> 34:49.612
He said he need
to talk to someone.

34:49.648 --> 34:52.351
He, uh, uh,
give me money for food.

34:52.385 --> 34:54.355
I never see him again.

34:54.389 --> 34:57.394
You said earlier that there was
a man at the apartment.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.297
When I go to...

34:59.332 --> 35:01.334
the market
to go buy food,

35:02.369 --> 35:03.638
When I come back...

35:03.872 --> 35:07.543
I see a man at the, um,
um, apartment,

35:07.578 --> 35:09.913
Not my father.

35:09.948 --> 35:12.649
I was so scared,
so I leave.

35:12.683 --> 35:14.951
Then I hear Cano Vega
is dead.

35:14.985 --> 35:19.055
So I run, and I hide.

35:19.089 --> 35:21.691
I just wanted to go home.

35:21.725 --> 35:24.059
He killed my father.

35:24.094 --> 35:27.996
This man who came
to your apartment...

35:28.030 --> 35:30.465
can you describe him
for me?

35:30.499 --> 35:32.967
Yes.

35:33.002 --> 35:35.436
Let--let me
get this straight.

35:35.471 --> 35:38.271
An illegal claiming to be
Cano Vega's daughter,

35:38.306 --> 35:41.239
after being in this country
for less than 24 hours,

35:41.273 --> 35:43.836
identifies someone
who kind of looks like me

35:43.870 --> 35:45.934
from a distance at night?

35:45.968 --> 35:47.400
Well, gee, guys.

35:47.434 --> 35:50.300
What, do I--what, do I sign
my confession right now

35:50.334 --> 35:52.533
or after the big, uh,
press conference?

35:52.567 --> 35:54.365
Well, now's good.

35:54.433 --> 35:56.365
Come on, kids.

35:56.399 --> 35:57.899
Come on.

35:57.933 --> 35:59.734
You know he was my friend.

35:59.768 --> 36:01.337
Not to mention,
a hefty commission.

36:01.371 --> 36:03.007
What's my motive?

36:03.108 --> 36:04.908
The thing about people
who have a lot, Mr. Fox,

36:05.041 --> 36:06.908
is that they have
the most to lose.

36:07.042 --> 36:09.576
I'm sure Vega felt betrayed
when he learned the truth.

36:09.611 --> 36:12.444
The truth? About what?

36:12.478 --> 36:15.712
Your favorite story--
Barcelona, 1992.

36:15.846 --> 36:18.881
Only you left out the part
where you lied to Cano Vega

36:18.915 --> 36:20.385
about helping
his fianc

36:20.419 --> 36:22.456
It's not my fault
that she changed her mind,

36:22.490 --> 36:25.692
All right?
Truth is, you <i>couldn't</i>
get her off the island.

36:25.726 --> 36:28.160
But you did know that
he'd rather be there with her

36:28.195 --> 36:30.629
than here making big bucks
for you in the majors.

36:30.664 --> 36:33.131
So you let him believe
that she had changed her mind.

36:33.165 --> 36:35.334
And to keep him from ever
finding out the truth,

36:35.368 --> 36:36.302
you had her put away.

36:36.336 --> 36:40.637
Put away? In Cuba?
oh, come on.

36:41.672 --> 36:43.006
I-I have a lot of pull,

36:43.040 --> 36:45.174
but, uh, influencing
a military dictatorship

36:45.208 --> 36:46.709
isn't as easy

36:46.743 --> 36:48.610
as getting a dinner reservation
at Le Cirque.

36:48.644 --> 36:50.645
You'd influenced
their people before.

36:50.679 --> 36:53.347
Manuel Gutierrez,
A.K.A. <i>El pulpo--</i>

36:53.382 --> 36:54.848
The octopus.

36:54.883 --> 36:56.817
You walked away
with the star player

36:56.884 --> 36:58.885
of the Cuban national team
for a rolex.

36:58.919 --> 37:00.486
We did a little research.

37:00.521 --> 37:04.023
He was the chief witness
at her trial.

37:04.057 --> 37:05.724
Was denouncing
Vega's fianc

37:05.759 --> 37:07.793
always a part of your plan
with <i>el pulpo</i>

37:07.827 --> 37:09.761
or did you have to
pay extra for that?

37:09.796 --> 37:11.896
I've heard
you're a killer negotiator.

37:11.931 --> 37:14.099
You can't possibly
be serious.

37:14.100 --> 37:15.100
When Vega figured out
what you had done,

37:15.133 --> 37:18.201
he called you from his club
and told you to meet him.

37:18.235 --> 37:20.703
I think he came after you
and threatened to destroy you

37:20.737 --> 37:24.205
And that's why you killed him.
It's a hell of a story, kids.

37:24.240 --> 37:27.341
I paid <i>el pulpo</i> to take care
of my player's girl

37:27.375 --> 37:29.843
when the Cuban government is
sending away people every day?

37:29.877 --> 37:32.512
That's a hell of a tale.

37:32.546 --> 37:34.146
It's pure conjecture.

37:34.181 --> 37:35.915
You know
what's not conjecture?

37:35.949 --> 37:37.383
The blood that we found

37:37.417 --> 37:40.485
on the driver's side floor mat
in your car.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.156
That was Vega's blood.
As much as you tried to clean

37:43.190 --> 37:45.457
those $5,000 pair of shoes
you were wearing

37:45.492 --> 37:46.926
while you smashed
Vega's skull in,

37:47.060 --> 37:48.428
you didn't
quite get all of it.

37:54.497 --> 37:56.397
Hello, Cynthia.
Call my lawyer.

37:56.432 --> 37:58.366
You tell him
he's about to earn

37:58.400 --> 38:01.134
the outrageous, obscene amounts
of money I pay him.

38:04.271 --> 38:06.271
Turn around.

38:06.305 --> 38:07.739
Turn around.

38:07.773 --> 38:12.076
Robert Fox, you're under arrest
for the murder of Cano Vega.

38:13.612 --> 38:15.946
What's gonna happen
to Lara?

38:15.980 --> 38:17.581
She can stay in the states
for a year, and then decide

38:17.615 --> 38:19.649
whether she wants to apply
for citizenship or not.

38:19.650 --> 38:21.450
Oh, I can't imagine
her staying.

38:21.984 --> 38:23.617
Her last bit of family
is gone.

38:23.652 --> 38:26.653
I mean, the only person
that she knew here is dead.

38:28.288 --> 38:29.321
Well, there is
one more person

38:29.355 --> 38:31.789
that she should meet.

38:36.593 --> 38:38.627
So you're Lara?

38:38.662 --> 38:42.962
She was born in Cuba
right after Mr. Vega defected.

38:42.997 --> 38:45.264
She's <i>not</i> his girlfriend.

38:45.299 --> 38:48.034
She's his daughter.
Cano had a daughter?

38:48.068 --> 38:50.469
My father...

38:50.503 --> 38:53.271
didn't know how you would like
to have me here.

38:53.305 --> 38:55.973
He, uh... he had fear

38:56.007 --> 38:58.208
to tell you about me.

39:01.077 --> 39:02.011
It's okay.

39:02.046 --> 39:06.614
<i>Yo s</i>

39:06.648 --> 39:08.648
<i>Y nunca quiso herirla.</i>

39:08.683 --> 39:11.517
She says she knows her father
loved you very much,

39:11.552 --> 39:14.019
and he didn't want
to hurt you.

39:14.053 --> 39:16.021
<i>Pero yo espero...</i>

39:16.055 --> 39:18.689
Uh... <i>Al igual que mi pap</i>

39:18.723 --> 39:20.791
<i>Que juntos podriamos formar</i>
<i>una familia.</i>

39:20.825 --> 39:23.626
And that she hoped
and he hoped that,

39:23.661 --> 39:26.428
together,
you could be a family.

39:31.266 --> 39:33.000
<i>yo soy</i> Maggie.

39:34.702 --> 39:37.705
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

39:40.142 --> 39:41.746
Thank you.

39:55.542 --> 39:57.743
Hey, dad.

39:57.778 --> 40:00.312
Hey, daughter.
What are you doing up so late?

40:00.347 --> 40:03.215
Waiting for you.
Did I do something wrong?

40:03.249 --> 40:05.850
No.

40:05.885 --> 40:08.419
I was just thinking about
what you said about your dad,

40:08.453 --> 40:11.755
how he could be anything
you imagine him to be--

40:11.789 --> 40:13.323
An astronaut or a pirate.

40:13.357 --> 40:15.625
Whipped cream inventor.
Or whipped cream inventor.

40:15.659 --> 40:17.793
But there's one thing
he can't be.

40:17.828 --> 40:20.295
What's that?
A dad.

40:20.330 --> 40:23.932
Just a regular dad, teaching
his son how to ride a bike

40:23.966 --> 40:27.234
or helping him with homework
or having a catch.

40:27.269 --> 40:30.170
It makes me sad you didn't get
to have those things.

40:30.205 --> 40:32.772
Well... I can't miss
what I didn't have.

40:32.807 --> 40:34.974
?

40:35.009 --> 40:37.710
What if you could have it?

40:37.744 --> 40:40.979
You have a time machine
behind the kitchen counter?

40:45.651 --> 40:48.319
? well, it's the morning
I love best ?

40:48.353 --> 40:50.587
What do you say, son?

40:50.622 --> 40:53.256
How about a game of catch
with your old man?

40:53.291 --> 40:56.359
? ...Than I'll allow ?

40:56.393 --> 40:58.727
Yeah, I'd like that.

40:58.762 --> 41:00.496
Good.

41:00.530 --> 41:04.232
? I don't want to be reminded ?

41:04.266 --> 41:06.267
Ooh!

41:06.301 --> 41:08.168
? at all ?

41:08.236 --> 41:12.105
? that I no longer
have the time ?

41:12.139 --> 41:14.740
You ready?

41:14.775 --> 41:15.941
Ready.

41:15.976 --> 41:19.011
? ...Rising around me ?

41:20.980 --> 41:23.515
Oh.
