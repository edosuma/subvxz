WEBVTT

00:00.086 --> 00:01.304
The show's on!

00:01.328 --> 00:04.539
<i>In 1972, there were
a lot of crazy game shows on TV.</i>

00:04.609 --> 00:06.742
<i>"Hollywood Squares,"
"Let's Make a Deal,"</i>

00:06.789 --> 00:10.438
<i>but the strangest one of all
was The Vietnam Draft Lottery.</i>

00:10.493 --> 00:13.461
<i>We come to you tonight
from Selective Service Headquarters</i>

00:13.516 --> 00:16.073
<i>in Washington, D.C.,
for the draft lottery...</i>

00:16.143 --> 00:18.167
<i>It was like the show
"Truth or Consequences,"</i>

00:18.237 --> 00:20.171
<i>except the consequences
were life and death,</i>

00:20.264 --> 00:22.187
<i>and my family struggled with
telling the truth about it.</i>

00:22.215 --> 00:23.798
Whatever happens with this,

00:23.833 --> 00:25.249
your country's gonna take care of you.

00:25.285 --> 00:27.702
Frank burned the popcorn. It's ruined.

00:27.737 --> 00:29.420
- You get all the kernels?
- Every last one.

00:29.456 --> 00:31.773
Then it's delicious.

00:31.808 --> 00:34.025
- Eddie's war show on?
- It just started.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.543
Well, sorry we're late.

00:35.578 --> 00:37.545
Wendi was trying to teach me
how to change lanes

00:37.580 --> 00:39.347
and I just couldn't get over.

00:39.382 --> 00:42.200
You know, if you keep driving,
there's a place called Sylmar?

00:42.235 --> 00:44.235
- I'm so nervous for you, Eddie.
- Me?

00:44.287 --> 00:45.737
<i>You're</i> the one driving with my mom.

00:45.789 --> 00:47.188
Even if they pick Eddie's birthday,

00:47.207 --> 00:49.374
he won't get called up until
he graduates from high school.

00:49.409 --> 00:50.708
Hear that, Pat?

00:50.744 --> 00:52.543
You'll probably go to
Vietnam before he does.

00:52.579 --> 00:54.612
I'll win the war with karate-chops!

00:54.647 --> 00:57.248
You can't use karate-chops.
That's <i> their</i> thing.

00:57.283 --> 00:58.750
How are you doing?

00:58.785 --> 01:00.868
Whatever happens, my country's
going to take care of me.

01:00.903 --> 01:02.170
Yeah, they'll take care of you.

01:02.205 --> 01:03.538
They'll give you a gun, a pine box

01:03.573 --> 01:04.839
and Mom and Dad get a free flag.

01:04.858 --> 01:07.392
Wow, Lawrence coming in hot.

01:07.427 --> 01:08.793
Well, we could use a new flag...

01:08.828 --> 01:10.628
thank you, Alaska and Hawaii.

01:10.663 --> 01:12.697
Like I'm gonna spring
for a new fifty-star flag

01:12.732 --> 01:14.432
with Puerto Rico knocking on the door.

01:14.467 --> 01:15.716
<i>To anyone sensible,</i>

01:15.735 --> 01:17.652
<i>this would look like
a family "in no mood."</i>

01:17.687 --> 01:19.604
<i>But my young eyes saw nine people</i>

01:19.639 --> 01:21.055
<i>facing the same direction,</i>

01:21.091 --> 01:22.590
<i>AKA an audience.</i>

01:22.609 --> 01:25.843
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:25.879 --> 01:28.830
I have here two ordinary

01:28.865 --> 01:31.416
sterling silver rings!

01:31.451 --> 01:32.750
That's steel with chrome plating.

01:32.786 --> 01:34.568
You paid for silver,
the guy saw you coming.

01:34.587 --> 01:36.237
Magic is scary.

01:36.256 --> 01:37.505
The only thing scary about magic

01:37.540 --> 01:39.090
is the weird, lonely men who do it.

01:39.125 --> 01:40.374
Timmy, scram.

01:41.878 --> 01:43.410
They're calling the first birthday.

01:43.430 --> 01:45.096
<i>It was both ceremonial
and darkly absurd.</i>

01:45.131 --> 01:47.048
<i>A congressman pulled a random date.</i>

01:47.083 --> 01:49.183
<i>And every draft-age boy
with that birthday</i>

01:49.219 --> 01:51.936
<i>moved up in the line
to be sent off to war.</i>

01:51.971 --> 01:53.721
I cannot wait to do my duty.

01:53.756 --> 01:56.057
Go overseas and kill Nazis like Dad did.

01:56.092 --> 01:57.608
There aren't any Nazis in this war.

01:57.644 --> 01:58.926
'Cause Dad got 'em all!

01:58.945 --> 02:00.611
Honestly, the rigmarole.

02:00.647 --> 02:02.447
I'll just say it...
I hope they give you a pass.

02:02.482 --> 02:03.898
- Thank you, Mrs. Cleary.
- Absolutely.

02:03.933 --> 02:06.267
Eddie's too nice
to kill anyone in a war...

02:06.286 --> 02:08.068
at least on purpose.

02:08.104 --> 02:10.121
Sweetie, no offense, nobody wants to see

02:10.156 --> 02:13.241
that frantic moon-pie face
last thing before they die.

02:13.276 --> 02:15.530
If he gets called,
he'll do his duty. Period.

02:15.555 --> 02:18.496
But if you <i> do</i> get drafted,
you have choices.

02:18.548 --> 02:20.081
Sure. What do you want the guys

02:20.116 --> 02:21.082
in your outfit to call you,

02:21.117 --> 02:23.139
Eddie or Ed? <i>That's</i> your choice.

02:23.164 --> 02:24.552
I'm gonna go by Francis.

02:24.587 --> 02:26.971
Ooh, that'll put
fear in the heart of the enemy.

02:27.006 --> 02:28.923
- I know.
- I was talking about deferments.

02:28.958 --> 02:30.725
I know a guy who ate
only celery for six weeks,

02:30.760 --> 02:32.510
and the night before
his physical sat in a steam room

02:32.562 --> 02:34.896
until he was down to 115 pounds.

02:34.931 --> 02:36.564
Oh, there's a profile in courage.

02:36.599 --> 02:38.465
And then, of course,
there's always Canada...

02:38.485 --> 02:40.601
Oh, no. No son of mine
is going to Canada.

02:40.636 --> 02:43.437
That place accepts
every low-life and coward.

02:43.472 --> 02:45.439
The whole country's un-American.

02:45.474 --> 02:46.941
I have always wanted to see Banff.

02:46.976 --> 02:48.475
The best plan is ending this craziness

02:48.495 --> 02:49.944
so that nobody else has to go.

02:49.979 --> 02:51.979
There's a huge march
against the war on Wednesday.

02:51.998 --> 02:54.148
So I guess by Thursday,
it'll all be over...

02:54.167 --> 02:57.001
maybe... Wednesday afternoon
if you march real good.

02:57.036 --> 02:58.753
<i>October 28th...</i>

02:58.788 --> 03:01.122
I can't believe this.
This says that I've...

03:01.157 --> 03:02.924
lost my deferment.

03:02.959 --> 03:04.709
They're gonna put you
in the lottery, too?

03:05.962 --> 03:07.295
No lottery for me.

03:08.464 --> 03:09.797
I've been drafted.

03:13.853 --> 03:15.853
Some really tense stuff in there.

03:15.889 --> 03:18.940
Let me take your minds off
your troubles, good sirs.

03:18.975 --> 03:21.008
The next show is about to begin!

03:21.027 --> 03:22.610
The price is one dollar.

03:22.645 --> 03:24.028
Absolutely free!

03:24.063 --> 03:25.980
No, you give <i> me</i> a dollar.

03:26.015 --> 03:28.515
Which is reasonable considering
what they pay test subjects

03:28.535 --> 03:30.451
for enduring painful
medical experiments.

03:30.486 --> 03:32.486
"Report for Army induction and training

03:32.521 --> 03:36.123
to Fort Irwin in Barstow,
California..." in eight days.

03:36.159 --> 03:37.858
<i>My mom was upset by what the U.S. Army</i>

03:37.877 --> 03:39.327
<i>wanted to do to her family.</i>

03:39.362 --> 03:40.661
<i>But not having nuclear weapons,</i>

03:40.696 --> 03:43.214
<i>she went off against
a less formidable foe.</i>

03:43.249 --> 03:44.665
Barstow?

03:44.700 --> 03:46.050
I mean, they probably
send you to Barstow first

03:46.085 --> 03:47.701
so Vietnam doesn't seem so bad.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.387
Barstow's not the problem, Mom.

03:49.422 --> 03:50.871
It is for the people who live there.

03:50.890 --> 03:53.374
Ugh, I lost my religious
studies deferment.

03:53.393 --> 03:54.725
'Cause you washed out at the seminary.

03:54.761 --> 03:55.876
I didn't wash out.

03:55.895 --> 03:57.678
I made a thoughtful, informed choice.

03:57.713 --> 03:59.046
Yeah, now your only choice is,

03:59.065 --> 04:01.148
do you want to be called
Lawrence or Buzzcut?

04:01.184 --> 04:02.650
'Cause trust me, the Army...

04:02.685 --> 04:04.151
they're not putting up with <i> that</i> salad.

04:04.187 --> 04:06.053
Here I was, worried about
getting called up

04:06.072 --> 04:07.855
in eight or nine months, and you...

04:07.890 --> 04:10.324
- Eight days.
- I'm so sorry, Lawrence.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.159
Okay, you just go back to the seminary

04:12.195 --> 04:13.995
until this whole war thing blows over.

04:14.030 --> 04:15.830
Look, I know the priesthood's
not your "calling" anymore,

04:15.865 --> 04:17.582
but I was never really
"called" to be a mother.

04:17.617 --> 04:19.399
You make the best of a bad situation.

04:19.418 --> 04:21.369
- And we appreciate it, Mom.
- Yeah.

04:21.404 --> 04:22.569
I'm not going to the seminary,

04:22.589 --> 04:23.838
and I'm not going to Fort Irwin.

04:23.873 --> 04:25.373
I'm calling my friend in Canada.

04:25.408 --> 04:28.042
Oh, here we go.
No, you are not using my phone

04:28.077 --> 04:29.677
for any draft-dodging calls.

04:29.712 --> 04:31.429
Especially not long-distance!

04:31.464 --> 04:33.097
Fine. I'll go use the pay phone

04:33.132 --> 04:34.548
over at the Kentucky Fried Chicken!

04:34.583 --> 04:36.851
Be sure to thank the Colonel
for his service!

04:40.607 --> 04:43.224
I have a couple more
thoughts about Barstow...

04:43.259 --> 04:46.393
I have poured ordinary Rice Krispies

04:46.412 --> 04:48.779
into this ordinary bowl.

04:48.815 --> 04:50.364
Everything around here is ordinary.

04:50.383 --> 04:51.649
You don't have to keep rubbing it in.

04:51.684 --> 04:53.300
He's still doing his dumb magic?

04:53.319 --> 04:55.536
There's a lot of windup on this one.

04:55.571 --> 04:57.604
We all know that newspapers

04:57.624 --> 04:59.640
can hold valuable information.

04:59.676 --> 05:01.475
But can they hold...

05:01.511 --> 05:02.705
milk?

05:05.014 --> 05:06.764
Hey, stupid! Stop that!

05:06.799 --> 05:09.000
It's gonna make a mess on Mom's floor.

05:13.690 --> 05:15.389
Or is it?

05:15.408 --> 05:17.775
W-Where... Where'd it go?

05:17.827 --> 05:19.510
Wait a minute.

05:19.545 --> 05:21.295
What's that I hear?

05:21.330 --> 05:23.481
Snap, Crackle, Pop.

05:26.769 --> 05:28.653
I have no idea how you did that.

05:28.705 --> 05:30.237
Or why.

05:32.925 --> 05:34.492
You didn't make that milk disappear.

05:34.527 --> 05:35.793
It's obviously a trick!

05:35.828 --> 05:37.161
Of course it's a trick, Frank.

05:37.196 --> 05:38.629
You're kind of missing the point.

05:38.665 --> 05:41.148
I'm not missing anything.
You're not magic!

05:41.167 --> 05:43.367
Like most so-called entertainment...

05:43.419 --> 05:46.187
movies, love songs... i-it's just <i> lying.</i>

05:46.222 --> 05:48.222
I remember that speech from
when you stood up in the theater

05:48.257 --> 05:50.574
and ruined "Herbie the Love Bug"
for everyone.

05:50.610 --> 05:52.226
This is why I don't do tricks for you.

05:52.245 --> 05:54.161
- You can't handle it.
- What I can't handle

05:54.196 --> 05:56.914
is you acting like the laws of
physics don't apply to you.

05:56.966 --> 05:58.616
Do it again!
And you're gonna keep doing it

05:58.651 --> 06:00.484
until I figure out how it works.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.770
Are you sure you want
to put yourself through this?

06:02.805 --> 06:04.155
It might make you more unhappy.

06:04.190 --> 06:06.440
Not possible.

06:06.459 --> 06:09.284
<i>August 10th. August one-zero.</i>

06:09.309 --> 06:11.012
I couldn't get ahold of my friend.

06:11.047 --> 06:13.264
Oh, do you think he might be
"dodging" your phone call?

06:13.299 --> 06:15.232
The boys there are men of conscience

06:15.268 --> 06:17.535
who don't want to participate
in an unjust war.

06:17.570 --> 06:18.869
If they don't want to participate,

06:18.905 --> 06:20.221
they don't belong in this country.

06:20.256 --> 06:21.739
That's why they went to Canada.

06:21.774 --> 06:23.708
Hey, Eddie, that's your birthday!

06:23.743 --> 06:24.809
Oh, no.

06:24.844 --> 06:27.445
<i>February 22nd. February two-two.</i>

06:27.497 --> 06:28.696
What did you win?

06:28.731 --> 06:31.282
Oh, he won that Eddie and other boys

06:31.317 --> 06:34.335
with the same birthday
are going to the war.

06:34.370 --> 06:36.187
You can all have cake together!

06:36.222 --> 06:37.788
This seems crazy.

06:37.824 --> 06:40.107
It's a proud moment.
We need to celebrate.

06:40.142 --> 06:41.642
Peg, we have any champagne?

06:41.661 --> 06:44.245
I have some distilled water
I use for ironing.

06:44.280 --> 06:45.880
What exactly are we celebrating?

06:45.915 --> 06:48.082
The day my two boys
are called to serve...

06:48.117 --> 06:49.633
even if one of them runs to Canada.

06:49.669 --> 06:51.886
Peg, ironing water for everybody.

06:51.921 --> 06:52.970
Yeah.

06:57.009 --> 06:58.476
You don't really feel like celebrating,

06:58.511 --> 06:59.810
do you, Mrs. Cleary?

06:59.846 --> 07:01.729
I don't know what I can do about it yet.

07:01.764 --> 07:03.964
Anyway, the joke's on Mike.

07:03.983 --> 07:05.766
I've been refilling this from the tap.

07:07.136 --> 07:08.969
This is <i> your</i> generation's war, Eddie.

07:08.988 --> 07:11.605
It's an opportunity for you
to distinguish yourself.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.607
Boys go over there
and they come back men.

07:13.642 --> 07:14.742
Unless they don't come back.

07:14.777 --> 07:16.327
Don't listen to Negative Nelly.

07:16.362 --> 07:17.778
I know you're gonna make me proud, son.

07:19.782 --> 07:21.031
Aye aye, captain!

07:23.000 --> 07:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:34.510 --> 07:36.644
Lawrence...

07:36.679 --> 07:38.294
Kid's driving me up the wall

07:38.319 --> 07:40.898
with his thoughts and ideas.

07:40.933 --> 07:42.678
Thank God we don't have
that problem with Eddie.

07:42.703 --> 07:43.745
Seems pretty greedy,

07:43.770 --> 07:46.044
the Army trying to take <i>two</i> of our boys.

07:46.069 --> 07:47.872
And we get no say about it?

07:47.907 --> 07:48.861
At the very least,

07:48.886 --> 07:51.108
they should let me pick
which two we send.

07:51.144 --> 07:52.943
That would keep these kids in line.

07:52.979 --> 07:54.424
Mommy, I had a bad dream.

07:54.449 --> 07:55.513
Can I sleep in your bed?

07:55.548 --> 07:58.018
- Pat.
- It's okay, Mike.

08:00.665 --> 08:03.066
What was your dream about?

08:03.117 --> 08:04.450
- War.
- Hmm...

08:04.490 --> 08:06.524
Will I have to go to Vietnam someday?

08:06.559 --> 08:08.275
Oh, honey.

08:08.294 --> 08:10.428
That's not gonna happen.

08:10.463 --> 08:12.947
There will be a whole
different war by then.

08:12.982 --> 08:15.149
I only hope you and I
are on the same side.

08:15.168 --> 08:16.950
<i>The events of
the day also weighed heavily</i>

08:16.969 --> 08:18.586
<i>on other members of the family.</i>

08:20.556 --> 08:22.606
Timmy, I need to know
where the milk went!

08:22.642 --> 08:25.042
To know what? Why... Why are
your hands so sweaty?

08:25.078 --> 08:26.293
Endocrine problems.

08:26.328 --> 08:28.446
Don't try to cleverly change
the subject.

08:28.481 --> 08:30.681
Frank, we are trying to sleep.

08:30.717 --> 08:32.650
Nobody sleeps until
Timmy explains his trick.

08:32.684 --> 08:34.618
Just tell him how you do it.

08:34.654 --> 08:36.453
But I swore an oath
to the Ancient Brotherhood

08:36.489 --> 08:38.789
of Magicians, Jugglers and Fire-eaters.

08:38.825 --> 08:41.125
Even if the enemy takes me
captive, I can't tell.

08:41.159 --> 08:43.059
- What enemy?
- The Fraternal Order of Mimes,

08:43.096 --> 08:44.662
Unicyclists and Sword-swallowers.

08:44.697 --> 08:48.032
Frank, why not try to enjoy
Timmy's trick for what it is?

08:48.067 --> 08:49.700
Life becomes so much less wondrous

08:49.736 --> 08:51.602
when you strip away
all of its mysteries.

08:51.654 --> 08:53.571
Okay! If it shuts you up,

08:53.606 --> 08:55.239
I'll give you the secret
of Timmy's dumb trick.

08:55.274 --> 08:57.308
"Dumb trick," but we're all
talking about it.

08:57.343 --> 08:58.676
I've sworn no oaths

08:58.711 --> 09:01.145
and I'm not frightened
of sword-swallowers.

09:01.180 --> 09:02.780
It's the mimes
you have to watch out for.

09:02.815 --> 09:04.482
But you'll have to wait 'til tomorrow,

09:04.517 --> 09:05.783
after a good night's sleep.

09:05.818 --> 09:08.152
For the friends-and-family
price of ten dollars.

09:08.187 --> 09:09.253
Shake on it.

09:10.406 --> 09:13.107
Oh, you weren't kidding.
That hand is like an armpit.

09:13.126 --> 09:14.775
- Then you should feel my ankles.
- Frank, turn out the light.

09:14.794 --> 09:16.010
Turn...

09:18.731 --> 09:21.782
You being drafted just makes
me feel so powerless.

09:22.785 --> 09:23.784
I'm sorry.

09:23.820 --> 09:24.819
If I could,

09:24.854 --> 09:27.138
you know I'd trade places with you.

09:27.190 --> 09:28.589
But you heard Lawrence.

09:28.608 --> 09:30.541
There are options we could try.

09:30.576 --> 09:32.293
Uh, you could get a college deferment.

09:32.328 --> 09:34.595
You said you wouldn't push
this college stuff on me.

09:34.630 --> 09:37.448
I'm reconsidering now that
the other option is death.

09:37.483 --> 09:40.601
I think it's just better if
I see this draft thing through.

09:40.620 --> 09:43.137
I've got an opportunity
to distinguish myself here.

09:44.307 --> 09:46.440
That's exactly what your dad said.

09:46.476 --> 09:48.509
You're doing this just to impress him.

09:48.528 --> 09:49.810
No.

09:49.829 --> 09:51.195
But he <i> was</i> impressed, right?

09:51.247 --> 09:53.113
I'm not just imagining that.

09:53.132 --> 09:54.598
Will you talk some sense
to your brother?

09:54.634 --> 09:55.766
Don't let Dad bully you.

09:55.802 --> 09:57.217
You gotta think for yourself.

09:57.236 --> 09:58.552
Do what Lawrence tells you...

09:58.571 --> 09:59.820
think for yourself.

10:03.209 --> 10:05.342
I'll be back later for
your mom's driving lesson.

10:06.312 --> 10:08.195
Please, talk to him.

10:13.319 --> 10:16.487
Wendi said I should talk to you,
so here goes.

10:16.522 --> 10:19.023
I enjoy playing basketball.

10:19.058 --> 10:20.758
I do as well.

10:20.793 --> 10:21.926
Shall we?

10:21.961 --> 10:23.427
What a lovely talk.

10:23.462 --> 10:24.595
Horse!

10:26.933 --> 10:28.432
What's the secret of Timmy's trick?

10:32.505 --> 10:33.637
Who are you calling?

10:36.826 --> 10:39.310
"Abraca-Dave's Magic Shop"?

10:39.345 --> 10:41.378
<i>I</i> could have called a magic shop.

10:41.430 --> 10:43.297
But could you get the top
guy on the phone?

10:43.322 --> 10:44.348
<i>Hello?</i>

10:44.383 --> 10:45.783
Hi. Abraca-Dave, please.

10:45.835 --> 10:47.084
There is no Dave.

10:47.119 --> 10:49.253
That was just brilliant marketing.

10:49.288 --> 10:51.622
You're talking to The Great Pepe.

10:51.657 --> 10:53.574
Hi, Pepe. I'm wondering
if you're familiar

10:53.609 --> 10:55.743
with the trick where milk
is poured into the newspaper

10:55.778 --> 10:57.912
- and then...
- Ah, The Reappearing Cow.

10:57.947 --> 10:59.380
That's part of our breakfast line.

10:59.415 --> 11:01.815
I usually pair it with
The Pancakes of Doom.

11:01.851 --> 11:03.651
I need to know how the milk thing works.

11:03.686 --> 11:05.786
Son, I can't just go around divulging...

11:05.821 --> 11:06.971
Wait a minute.

11:07.006 --> 11:08.539
Are you by any chance a mime?

11:08.574 --> 11:11.141
If I was a mime,
would I be talking to you?

11:11.177 --> 11:14.111
I'm asking for my dying grandfather.

11:14.146 --> 11:15.462
Make a noise like you're dying.

11:15.498 --> 11:17.248
Oh! Ah!! I've been shot!

11:17.300 --> 11:18.849
He's got dementia,

11:18.885 --> 11:21.452
but it's his dying wish
to understand that trick.

11:21.487 --> 11:23.437
Nice try, kid. When your grandpa passes,

11:23.456 --> 11:24.788
I'll call him up on the Ouija board

11:24.824 --> 11:25.923
and give him the whole shpiel.

11:25.975 --> 11:27.424
<i>Have a magical day.</i>

11:27.476 --> 11:29.560
Tell Pepe I say hello.

11:31.864 --> 11:33.998
- I want my money back.
- No refunds.

11:34.033 --> 11:35.616
But my business is built on

11:35.635 --> 11:38.102
customer satisfaction, so...

11:38.137 --> 11:40.437
I'm going to help you
re-create the trick.

11:40.473 --> 11:42.406
Anything to wipe that smug smile
off Timmy's face.

11:42.458 --> 11:45.109
- The kid has really got my goat.
- I can help with that, too.

11:45.144 --> 11:47.494
Goat recovery is, like,
80% of what I do.

12:46.989 --> 12:49.023
Oh! Good.

12:49.058 --> 12:50.941
Lawrence, that doesn't count.

12:50.977 --> 12:52.876
You get one more turn.

12:52.928 --> 12:54.678
Nice shot!

12:54.714 --> 12:55.980
Come here, you! Rrgh!

12:56.015 --> 12:56.981
Let's go!

12:57.016 --> 12:58.148
He's coming up, he's coming up!

12:58.184 --> 12:59.149
Yes!

13:00.286 --> 13:02.836
You can't do that!

13:02.872 --> 13:05.405
House is gonna feel pretty
empty without these two morons.

13:05.424 --> 13:07.257
I'd feel a lot better about this
if I understood

13:07.293 --> 13:09.093
why the heck we were sending
our boys over there.

13:09.128 --> 13:11.762
Well, the price we pay for freedom
is our young men defending it.

13:11.797 --> 13:14.231
No, when I said "our boys,"
I meant <i> our</i> boys.

13:14.266 --> 13:15.666
I'm all for the Flanigans exporting

13:15.701 --> 13:17.151
every one of their drooling chimps.

13:17.186 --> 13:19.103
We put a lot of work into these two.

13:19.138 --> 13:21.705
Honey, Communism is on the march.

13:21.741 --> 13:25.075
We give them Vietnam, they'll
take Thailand, Laos, and Burma.

13:25.111 --> 13:26.585
None of those are places I care about.

13:26.609 --> 13:28.479
If we don't fight them over there,
we'll end up fighting them over here.

13:28.531 --> 13:29.780
Wouldn't that be more convenient?

13:29.815 --> 13:31.398
Mike, I understood World War II,

13:31.433 --> 13:33.100
with Hitler and all those wiseacres,

13:33.119 --> 13:35.619
but this war doesn't even
have any decent villains.

13:35.638 --> 13:37.236
Who am I supposed to
hate this time? Jane Fonda?

13:37.260 --> 13:38.320
That's a good place to start.

13:38.345 --> 13:39.857
I don't want to see
Lawrence go to Canada,

13:39.892 --> 13:42.309
but if he chooses to, we need
to support that decision.

13:42.361 --> 13:44.361
Oh, so now we're trusting our idiot kids

13:44.397 --> 13:45.946
with important life decisions?

13:45.981 --> 13:48.282
Why not let Pat <i> choose</i> if
he wants to see the dentist?

13:48.317 --> 13:49.599
Pat has never been to a dentist.

13:49.618 --> 13:51.201
Because we made that decision for him.

13:51.237 --> 13:53.487
Lawrence is educated.
He's been out in the world.

13:53.539 --> 13:55.539
He stood on that spot where
you're in four states at once.

13:55.574 --> 13:58.108
I think he's smart enough
to make his own decisions.

13:58.127 --> 13:59.609
Mom, Dad,

13:59.628 --> 14:01.078
I've decided I'm going to Vietnam.

14:01.103 --> 14:03.149
Oh, shut up. What do you know?

14:04.126 --> 14:05.625
So now you want to go to Vietnam?

14:05.680 --> 14:07.532
Peg, Peg, he stood on four states.

14:07.587 --> 14:09.716
If this is his decision,
we should stand by it.

14:09.771 --> 14:11.904
Look, I've been thinking about
this mess, and if I don't go,

14:11.973 --> 14:13.802
the Army's not gonna say,
"Well, we're short one man,

14:13.862 --> 14:15.128
I guess we have to forfeit."

14:15.177 --> 14:16.457
They're just gonna draft the next guy.

14:16.482 --> 14:18.181
As long as the next guy's not my son!

14:18.250 --> 14:20.751
Maybe he's someone terrible
that we're better off without.

14:20.836 --> 14:22.619
They could take an axe murderer
or Jerry Lewis...

14:22.688 --> 14:24.144
we're all a little tired of <i> his</i> antics.

14:24.191 --> 14:26.425
Or they could take Eddie...
you think of that?

14:26.472 --> 14:29.259
Or some other guy like Eddie.
And I couldn't live with myself

14:29.344 --> 14:30.677
if something like that were to happen.

14:30.741 --> 14:31.995
We're proud of you, son.

14:32.064 --> 14:33.947
I'm not doing it to make you proud.

14:38.036 --> 14:39.102
All right, here we go.

14:39.221 --> 14:40.887
Prepare to be amazed and humiliated.

14:40.973 --> 14:43.156
You might want to work
on your patter, Frank.

14:43.242 --> 14:46.159
Ignore the hecklers. You're doing great.

14:46.211 --> 14:48.962
Ordinary newspaper...

14:49.064 --> 14:51.031
Ordinary milk, blah-blah-blah.

14:59.825 --> 15:03.610
And now the milk starts
magically disappearing...

15:03.662 --> 15:06.062
disappearing...

15:06.165 --> 15:07.597
like right now.

15:11.170 --> 15:12.502
No milk...

15:15.240 --> 15:16.523
...whatsoever.

15:17.860 --> 15:19.276
Feel pretty stupid yet?

15:19.344 --> 15:20.443
I'm okay.

15:20.546 --> 15:21.828
And now for the big, dumb finish

15:21.880 --> 15:24.047
where the milk reappears in the cereal.

15:24.149 --> 15:26.533
Wh... What's that I hear?

15:26.568 --> 15:28.985
Snap, crackle, and eat it, Timmy!

15:30.839 --> 15:32.556
There! I did it!

15:32.624 --> 15:35.759
I made a bowl of magic cereal
exactly as good as yours.

15:35.861 --> 15:36.943
Ta-da!

15:39.468 --> 15:42.516
I feel like we were one rehearsal short.

15:44.236 --> 15:45.735
Yeah, you got me, Frank.

15:45.854 --> 15:47.704
That is <i> exactly</i> how it's done.

15:51.793 --> 15:53.243
Frank, stop!

15:55.814 --> 15:57.948
- So, did you guys talk?
- Sure we talked.

15:58.033 --> 15:59.900
I told Lawrence that
he shot like our grandma.

15:59.985 --> 16:02.735
Yeah, but then I reminded him that
Grammy Agnes was the star guard

16:02.838 --> 16:04.704
on a ground-breaking CYO women's team.

16:04.790 --> 16:06.773
Led the league in scoring back in 1927.

16:06.859 --> 16:08.141
And then I clarified
that I knew all that.

16:08.227 --> 16:09.809
My comment about Grandma
was a compliment.

16:09.895 --> 16:11.595
- Nah.
- I was expecting you to convince him

16:11.663 --> 16:13.730
to stand up to your father
about Vietnam.

16:13.832 --> 16:15.281
That didn't come up.

16:15.384 --> 16:17.167
And, actually,

16:17.252 --> 16:18.935
I decided <i>I'm</i> going to Vietnam now.

16:19.004 --> 16:21.705
What? I was only gone for like an hour!

16:21.807 --> 16:23.607
- You're going?
- Yeah.

16:23.709 --> 16:24.958
Aw, man.

16:26.011 --> 16:27.961
I hope we end up in the same platoon.

16:29.381 --> 16:30.630
You guys are insane.

16:30.732 --> 16:33.016
If you won't talk
to your father, I will.

16:34.753 --> 16:36.569
- Mr. Cleary.
- Don't, Wendi.

16:36.672 --> 16:38.338
I'll do it. I'll talk to him.

16:40.859 --> 16:42.609
Nope.

16:42.694 --> 16:45.245
Mr. Cleary, you have two boys
about to go off to a war

16:45.330 --> 16:46.696
which even the people running the thing

16:46.782 --> 16:47.964
don't believe in anymore.

16:48.066 --> 16:49.699
This is between me and my two sons.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.234
Not when I really care
about one of them.

16:51.336 --> 16:52.636
It's me, right? Eddie?

16:53.605 --> 16:55.672
I hate the thought of either
of them going over there

16:55.741 --> 16:58.408
just so President Nixon doesn't
look weak before an election.

16:58.477 --> 17:00.210
The president is negotiating

17:00.295 --> 17:02.212
an honorable peace to this war,

17:02.314 --> 17:04.848
which he'll only get
by waging it aggressively.

17:04.950 --> 17:06.366
More war leading to peace.

17:06.451 --> 17:07.817
A lot of people think that's crazy.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.786
A lot of people who don't
really love this country.

17:09.871 --> 17:12.722
Or they love it enough to
criticize it so it can be better,

17:12.808 --> 17:15.090
the way you do with
someone you really care about.

17:15.176 --> 17:17.027
Is that why you and Mom
always criticize me?

17:17.095 --> 17:19.462
No, it's because you do dumb stuff.

17:19.548 --> 17:22.098
- Good call.
- Do you see what you do to him?

17:22.166 --> 17:24.134
Eddie is starved for your approval.

17:24.219 --> 17:25.885
You've a weird power over these boys.

17:25.988 --> 17:27.654
All right! That's enough, Wendi.

17:27.689 --> 17:29.239
No, it really isn't.

17:29.341 --> 17:30.607
I'm sorry, Mr. Cleary,

17:30.642 --> 17:33.009
but I'm worried that Eddie is
going to get himself killed

17:33.111 --> 17:35.378
just hoping you'll say
you're proud of him.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.647
We should get started
on that driving lesson.

17:37.733 --> 17:39.115
Right now.

17:43.972 --> 17:46.256
I know you agree with me about
Eddie and Lawrence.

17:46.341 --> 17:49.025
With Mike, you have to handle
things with a light touch.

17:58.220 --> 18:00.753
Mom ran over Lawrence!

18:00.806 --> 18:02.222
We'll know more in a day or two,

18:02.274 --> 18:04.624
but we're looking at about
three months in that cast.

18:04.710 --> 18:07.243
Now, I know he's supposed
to report to basic training,

18:07.346 --> 18:09.879
but that's off the table for now.

18:09.965 --> 18:11.147
You did this on purpose.

18:11.216 --> 18:12.565
I'll forgive you for saying that

18:12.601 --> 18:13.900
because you're in shock
from your broken foot.

18:13.986 --> 18:16.436
Yeah, which you gave me. On purpose.

18:16.521 --> 18:19.122
The "D" and the "R" on the steering
column are very confusing.

18:19.191 --> 18:20.957
Okay, enough of the silly speculation.

18:21.043 --> 18:23.173
This was definitely an accident.

18:23.267 --> 18:25.795
'Cause our insurance
doesn't cover vehicular assault.

18:25.881 --> 18:27.097
I had a plan, Dad.

18:27.199 --> 18:29.165
I really wanted to do this right.

18:29.267 --> 18:33.503
Sometimes these choices
get made for us...

18:33.605 --> 18:34.828
by a higher power.

18:34.859 --> 18:37.355
- Where's Eddie?
- You steer clear of Eddie.

18:37.542 --> 18:39.409
I'll deal with him.

18:41.046 --> 18:42.479
Take a walk with me.

18:42.564 --> 18:43.780
Just him.

18:43.865 --> 18:45.532
You and I have talked enough today.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.203
Oh, looky here.

18:50.288 --> 18:52.122
Nothing warms the heart more
than the sight of a baby

18:52.207 --> 18:55.108
that I don't have to feed
and clothe for two decades.

18:55.143 --> 18:56.676
Hello.

18:56.778 --> 18:59.062
You are not my problem.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.964
You know why hospitals
have these big windows

19:01.066 --> 19:02.582
- in the baby room?
- Hang on, doesn't it go,

19:02.617 --> 19:04.650
"Why do <i> Polish</i> hospitals
have these big windows?"

19:04.753 --> 19:06.219
- 'Cause I think I know this one.
- No.

19:06.304 --> 19:08.138
The school nurse told me
they have these windows

19:08.223 --> 19:11.057
mostly for other people...
people who are sick,

19:11.093 --> 19:13.076
people visiting loved ones
who aren't doing so well.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.694
They can walk down the corridor,

19:14.730 --> 19:17.113
look in, and see life.

19:17.232 --> 19:19.282
- See hope.
- I get it.

19:20.752 --> 19:22.335
Didn't you used to talk
about being a doctor

19:22.421 --> 19:24.671
- when you were little?
- A nurse, actually.

19:24.756 --> 19:26.206
A nurse, doctor.

19:26.258 --> 19:28.458
Neither's better than the other...

19:28.543 --> 19:29.926
except doctor's better.

19:30.011 --> 19:31.911
I used to pretend to be sick
and get out of class

19:32.013 --> 19:34.380
to hang out with Nurse Gail at school.

19:34.483 --> 19:36.066
She had lollipops.

19:36.184 --> 19:38.935
That story tells me you might
have the stuff to be a doctor.

19:39.020 --> 19:40.770
- Or a nurse.
- Or a doctor.

19:40.856 --> 19:42.572
Bottom line, you like people.

19:42.691 --> 19:44.223
I like lollipops.

19:44.326 --> 19:46.493
But you're a caring person.

19:46.578 --> 19:47.994
It's a special talent,

19:48.080 --> 19:50.330
like playing the fiddle,
or Evel Knievel.

19:50.415 --> 19:52.231
If you get your grades up,
you can get yourself

19:52.334 --> 19:54.066
into a decent medical program.

19:54.169 --> 19:56.002
Wendi really wants me
to go to college, too.

19:56.088 --> 19:57.570
That one has <i>a lot</i> of opinions.

20:00.208 --> 20:02.241
It's still a good idea.

20:02.344 --> 20:04.410
It sounds really hard, Dad.

20:04.546 --> 20:05.929
I'd like to see you give it a shot.

20:07.549 --> 20:09.099
You should know
there's more than one way

20:09.217 --> 20:10.917
to make me proud of you.

20:11.019 --> 20:12.552
<i>A couple months later, President Nixon</i>

20:12.637 --> 20:13.920
<i>ended the draft,</i>

20:14.022 --> 20:15.805
<i>sparing my brothers
any further physical peril</i>

20:15.891 --> 20:19.442
<i>from either the
North Vietnamese or my mom.</i>

20:23.785 --> 20:25.118
The Reappearing Cow.

20:25.170 --> 20:26.786
Page 152.

20:26.838 --> 20:29.122
What are you trying to pull?
That's a trick book, right?

20:29.174 --> 20:31.591
I-I open it and a knife pops out

20:31.626 --> 20:32.759
and slices my throat.

20:32.786 --> 20:33.952
What would be the point of that?

20:34.012 --> 20:36.629
Making me look dumb.

20:36.682 --> 20:37.931
<i>Like everybody who gets a chance</i>

20:37.966 --> 20:39.182
<i>to peek behind the curtain,</i>

20:39.217 --> 20:40.917
<i>Frank discovered that the knowing</i>

20:40.936 --> 20:43.520
<i>is often not as much
as fun as the not-knowing.</i>

20:43.555 --> 20:45.088
Hmm.

20:45.107 --> 20:46.606
That's it?

20:46.641 --> 20:47.924
Yeah.

20:47.943 --> 20:49.526
I almost wish a knife had popped out.

20:49.561 --> 20:50.927
I don't have a knife,

20:50.946 --> 20:52.779
but how about...

20:52.804 --> 20:54.100
this?!

20:54.162 --> 20:56.779
- How did you do that?
- Sorry, man.

20:56.850 --> 20:58.701
The answer was in the book.
