00:07.966 --> 00:09.176
Hey, Otis!

00:09.259 --> 00:11.094
-Otis
-Otis!

00:11.178 --> 00:14.306
Let's get rolling with Otis

00:14.389 --> 00:15.641
Hit the brakes!

00:15.724 --> 00:17.559
-Otis
-Otis!

00:17.643 --> 00:20.729
Let's get rolling with Otis

00:20.812 --> 00:21.897
Let's get rolling!

00:21.980 --> 00:24.900
Together on the farm
We play and we work hard

00:24.983 --> 00:28.111
-With help from Otis the tractor
-Yeah!

00:28.195 --> 00:31.365
When he feels his heart glowing
Otis gets going

00:31.448 --> 00:34.576
-So let's get rolling with Otis
-Otis!

00:38.747 --> 00:40.165
"Tune-Up Trouble."

00:42.501 --> 00:44.628
Tune-Up Day, Tune-Up Day

00:44.711 --> 00:46.880
I'm on my way to Tune-Up Day

00:47.464 --> 00:49.675
Good morning, sheeparoonies.

00:50.843 --> 00:53.637
Wha-- What now? Who's there?

00:53.720 --> 00:55.639
Tune-Up Day, Tune-Up Day

00:55.722 --> 00:58.058
I'm on my way to Tune-Up Day

00:58.141 --> 00:59.518
Morning, Sal.

00:59.601 --> 01:02.980
Otis! Wait up.
Where are you going in such a hurry?

01:03.063 --> 01:05.440
I don't want to be late for Tune-Up Day.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.317
Tune-Up Day, Tune-Up Day

01:07.401 --> 01:09.820
Hooray, hooray
It's Tune-Up Day

01:09.903 --> 01:12.114
Wait. What's a tune-up?

01:12.197 --> 01:13.824
Can I get one?

01:15.409 --> 01:17.995
Tune-ups are just for tractors and trucks.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.788
Look! It's starting.

01:20.956 --> 01:24.293
All right, Rusty.
How about we give these tires some air?

01:30.424 --> 01:33.218
Now, let's tighten those gears, shall we?

01:38.265 --> 01:40.726
And done.

01:42.227 --> 01:45.063
You'll be vrooming better and faster now.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.277
How are you feeling, Rusty?

01:51.361 --> 01:54.072
My engine and tires feel good as new.

01:56.742 --> 01:58.076
See you two later.

02:00.204 --> 02:01.455
-See ya.
-Bye, Rusty.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.835
Okay, Elaine is next.

02:06.919 --> 02:09.588
Then, after her, it's Kevin's turn.

02:09.670 --> 02:12.466
And after Kevin and Franny, it's my turn.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.595
Where is Kevin?

02:16.678 --> 02:18.680
He should be here. With us.

02:21.225 --> 02:23.519
Hey, Kevin! Over here.

02:23.602 --> 02:26.188
Big K coming your way, Otis.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.446
It's almost time for your tune-up.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.490
My what-up?

02:37.491 --> 02:39.034
Your tune-up.

02:39.117 --> 02:42.746
That's when you get your tires filled
with air and your gears tightened.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.081
I just learned that.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.376
Okay, Elaine. Tune-up time.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.004
And after Elaine, it's your turn, Kevin.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.926
No way. Not happening.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.387
Big K driving away.

02:59.721 --> 03:00.722
Kevin!

03:03.976 --> 03:05.102
Hit the brakes.

03:06.436 --> 03:07.771
Where are you going?

03:07.855 --> 03:11.942
I do not want to get a tune-up.
Nope. No, thank you.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.527
Why not, Kevin?

03:14.152 --> 03:18.323
Well, it's-- It's just that
I've never gotten one before,

03:18.407 --> 03:20.951
and, well…

03:22.119 --> 03:23.453
I'm scared.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.545
Do you want to wait a little?

03:31.628 --> 03:34.673
Sure. Maybe that would help.

03:34.756 --> 03:35.757
Come on.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.726
There. Franny can go next.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.562
And your turn will be later.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.939
Thanks, Otis.

03:51.023 --> 03:53.442
Want to find something else
to do together?

03:53.525 --> 03:56.945
Then, when we come back,
maybe you won't feel so scared.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.282
Big K says okay.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.201
Then let's get rolling.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.957
That's a weird sound.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.542
Come on, Kevin!

04:11.585 --> 04:12.669
Coming!

04:16.130 --> 04:18.257
Tune-Up Day, Tune-Up Day

04:18.341 --> 04:20.719
We're waiting a bit for Tune-Up Day

04:22.846 --> 04:26.600
Hopping hay bales. So many grain bags.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.021
Want to bring them to the farmhouse?

04:31.104 --> 04:34.107
You got it, Otis. High tire!

04:40.572 --> 04:42.866
Loading grain bags one by one

04:46.370 --> 04:48.914
We won't stop till the loading's done

04:51.625 --> 04:54.253
Loading grain is a helpful chore

04:58.841 --> 05:01.385
Keep on loading more and more

05:07.099 --> 05:08.433
Heavy.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.563
Your engine doesn't sound so good, Kevin.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.065
You really need that tune-up.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.569
Just a couple more bags?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.446
Sure, Kev.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.370
Okay, that's all the bags.

05:28.453 --> 05:31.248
Let's drop them off and get our tune-ups.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.835
Well, okay… I guess.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.968
We'd better hurry.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.387
That engine of yours is sounding worse.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.471
Let's go.

05:48.265 --> 05:50.184
Tune-Up Day, Tune-Up Day

05:50.267 --> 05:52.519
We're on our way to Tune-Up Day

05:52.603 --> 05:55.022
Tune-Up Day, Tune-Up Day

05:55.105 --> 05:57.232
We're on our way to Tune-Up--

05:57.816 --> 05:58.859
Oh, no.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.863
Hit the brakes.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.658
What happened, Kevin?

06:08.285 --> 06:09.786
My engine's not working.

06:11.330 --> 06:12.998
What am I gonna do now?

06:13.665 --> 06:15.125
I'm really worried.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.296
It's okay, Kevin.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.465
Farmer Naomi will fix your engine.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.259
We just need to get you to the farmhouse.

06:24.343 --> 06:26.929
Putt, puff, puttedy chuff.

06:27.012 --> 06:29.806
I'll help Kevin get to his tune-up.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.267
Great gears.

06:32.351 --> 06:35.729
Can I try using my winch
and pull you to the farmhouse?

06:37.147 --> 06:39.274
But I'm so much bigger than you.

06:39.358 --> 06:41.443
And I'm filled with grain bags.

06:41.527 --> 06:44.029
Kevin, we've got this.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.661
Okay. I'm ready when you are.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.330
Let's get rolling.

06:55.874 --> 06:58.126
Come on, Otis! Pull!

07:01.255 --> 07:04.591
I'm a hearty helper.

07:04.675 --> 07:09.179
And hearty helpers never give up!

07:10.597 --> 07:13.559
You're doing it, Otis. I-- I'm moving.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.435
I'm moving.

07:16.603 --> 07:20.691
This way to Tune-Up Day.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.703
I say "no way" to Tune-Up Day.

07:33.579 --> 07:35.330
Kevin, what's wrong?

07:35.414 --> 07:36.957
I can't do it.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.668
Those tools look super scary.

07:41.920 --> 07:46.133
You know, I was a little worried
when I got my first tune-up too.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.342
You were?

07:47.426 --> 07:51.013
Yep. But when it was over, I felt better.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.639
And you will too.

07:53.348 --> 07:57.895
Hey, would it help if I go first
so you can see what it's like?

07:59.479 --> 08:00.480
Maybe.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.318
How about this?

08:05.819 --> 08:08.906
I'll go next, and you can go after me.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.118
Then maybe you won't feel so scared.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.205
Okay.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.081
Thanks, Otis.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.293
Let's see who's next.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.088
Otis. Tune-up time.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.591
Then after Otis, it's Kevin's turn.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.551
Let's see here.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.429
First, let's tighten these engine gears.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.849
Just the job for my socket wrench.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.773
Does that hurt?

08:42.856 --> 08:44.441
Just for a second.

08:44.525 --> 08:45.943
Now…

08:47.486 --> 08:49.530
These can be inflated a bit.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.448
This air hose should do the trick.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.290
It kind of tickles.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.835
And now for tire number two.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.381
And they'll both be good as new.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.804
All done and ready to get rolling.

09:16.849 --> 09:19.226
My engine feels good as new.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.564
And look how full my tires are.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.028
That didn't look so bad.

09:30.112 --> 09:34.157
All right.
Last tune-up of Tune-Up Day is Kevin.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.993
You got this, Kevin.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.415
That engine sounds worn out.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.750
Let's unload some of these grain bags.

09:47.129 --> 09:50.215
Now roll up on the ramp
for your first farm tune-up.

09:55.971 --> 09:57.389
All right, Kevin.

09:57.472 --> 10:00.726
Those gears of yours
have to be tight-tight-tightened.

10:00.809 --> 10:04.730
Just gonna slide under here
to get a little closer to that engine.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.110
Just a little more.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.697
That wasn't so bad.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.365
It only hurt for a second.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.535
Keep it up, Kev. You're doing great.

10:19.703 --> 10:23.749
Listen to that purr. Engine's all set.

10:23.832 --> 10:27.461
Just got to pump those tires,
and Tune-Up Day is done.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.548
Air hose is ready to go.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.385
It does tickle.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.346
And look at my tire grow.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.473
Now for tire number two.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.394
Number three.

10:46.021 --> 10:49.733
And number four. All set.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.818
That's it for Tune-Up Day.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.446
You were totally right, Otis.

10:55.739 --> 10:58.033
My tires are fuller than ever.

10:59.076 --> 11:01.245
And listen to my engine vroom.

11:03.956 --> 11:05.999
And check out how fast I can turn.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.044
I feel great!

11:09.670 --> 11:11.046
Nice job, Kevin.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.424
High tire!

11:15.634 --> 11:18.136
I couldn't have done it without you, Otis.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.180
Thanks for being a hearty helper.

11:20.264 --> 11:22.933
On this farm, we all help each other.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.518
Let's vroom!

11:25.227 --> 11:27.229
Tune-Up Day, Tune-Up Day

11:27.312 --> 11:29.523
Today was my first Tune-Up Day

11:29.606 --> 11:31.817
Tune-Up Day, Tune-Up Day

11:31.900 --> 11:34.528
Hip-hip-hooray for Tune-Up Day!

11:39.116 --> 11:41.201
"Celeste's Song."

11:49.334 --> 11:50.627
Oink, oink, oink

11:50.711 --> 11:52.796
This is my song

11:52.880 --> 11:56.175
I'm making it up as I go along

11:57.926 --> 12:01.597
It'll be about something
Really special to me

12:01.680 --> 12:05.142
I just need a quiet place
To think of what that could be

12:05.225 --> 12:06.226
Oink, oink--

12:06.310 --> 12:07.644
Follow me!

12:08.312 --> 12:09.771
Too loud.

12:09.855 --> 12:12.691
Everybody leap! Whoo-moo!

12:12.774 --> 12:15.944
-Whoo-moo! Whoo-moo!
-Whoo-moo!

12:18.155 --> 12:19.615
-Farm-tastic.
-We did it!

12:19.698 --> 12:21.074
Cock-a-doodle-whoo-hoo!

12:21.158 --> 12:22.534
Let's go this way.

12:27.998 --> 12:31.293
Hi, Celeste.
Want to play follow-the-leader with us?

12:31.376 --> 12:34.296
No, thanks. I'm making up a song.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.173
Can I hear it?

12:36.256 --> 12:37.341
Uh-huh.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.675
Oink, oink, oink

12:38.759 --> 12:40.594
This is my song

12:40.677 --> 12:43.972
I'm making it up as I go along

12:44.056 --> 12:47.809
It'll be about something
Really special to me

12:47.893 --> 12:51.813
I just need a quiet place
To think of what that could be

12:51.897 --> 12:54.441
That's farm-tastic. Keep singing.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.444
I haven't finished it yet.

12:57.528 --> 13:01.114
But now that it's quiet,
I can make up the rest.

13:02.699 --> 13:03.867
Oink, oink--

13:09.623 --> 13:11.416
I didn't mean to sing, "Baa."

13:25.472 --> 13:27.641
So loud.

13:27.724 --> 13:28.851
Hit the brakes.

13:28.934 --> 13:31.436
-Follow me!
-Are you okay, Celeste?

13:31.520 --> 13:34.773
-It's too loud here to finish my song.
-Right behind ya!

13:34.857 --> 13:38.068
-It's too loud to even…
-Cock-a-doodle-do!

13:38.151 --> 13:39.736
What's the word?

13:39.820 --> 13:41.154
Think?

13:41.238 --> 13:43.824
-Yeah.
-Cock-a-doodle-do!

13:43.907 --> 13:46.410
This is frustrating.

13:49.580 --> 13:53.333
I'm a hearty helper.
There must be something I can do.

13:56.837 --> 13:59.381
-Can I help you find a quieter place?
-Whoo-moo!

14:00.299 --> 14:01.508
Coming.

14:01.592 --> 14:03.594
Yes, Otis. Yes, please!

14:05.345 --> 14:06.513
Come on.

14:10.434 --> 14:11.727
We'll find a quiet spot

14:11.810 --> 14:14.271
quicker than a duck can say,
"Quack, quack."

14:14.354 --> 14:15.939
Thanks, Otis.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.691
Let's get rolling.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.484
Yay!

14:21.278 --> 14:23.572
What do you think of this spot…

14:24.573 --> 14:25.574
here?

14:29.578 --> 14:30.579
Hear that?

14:31.288 --> 14:32.748
What?

14:32.831 --> 14:34.291
Nothing.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.543
Isn't it oink-cellent?

14:40.672 --> 14:42.257
So, what do you think?

14:42.341 --> 14:43.800
Does it make you want to…

14:43.884 --> 14:45.302
…sing?

14:45.969 --> 14:47.888
Yes!

14:49.556 --> 14:51.016
Oink, oink, oink

14:51.099 --> 14:53.101
This is my song

14:53.185 --> 14:56.522
I'm making it up as I go along

14:56.605 --> 14:58.065
It'll be about--

14:58.148 --> 14:59.483
Beep!

15:00.567 --> 15:02.402
That's not what I meant to sing.

15:02.486 --> 15:04.780
It's okay, Celeste. Try again.

15:06.198 --> 15:07.658
It'll be about--

15:07.741 --> 15:09.159
Clink!

15:09.243 --> 15:11.328
-I mean--
-Excuse me!

15:11.411 --> 15:13.580
Milk delivery coming through.

15:13.664 --> 15:15.123
Never mind.

15:19.169 --> 15:22.089
This spot isn't very quiet anymore.

15:23.257 --> 15:25.843
So much beeping and cheeping.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.846
I can't finish my song here!

15:29.471 --> 15:32.057
Can I help you find a new quiet spot?

15:32.140 --> 15:35.185
Yes, please. But where?

15:37.104 --> 15:40.274
I don't know yet,
but we won't stop till we find one.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.025
Come on.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.994
Too loud.

16:01.920 --> 16:02.921
No.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.682
-Nuh-uh.
-No.

16:19.313 --> 16:20.647
This might work.

16:24.318 --> 16:28.363
Oink-cellent!
I can see the whole farm from up here.

16:28.447 --> 16:30.824
You know what else is oink-cellent?

16:30.908 --> 16:31.909
Listen.

16:35.621 --> 16:39.833
It's quiet. Really quiet.

16:41.335 --> 16:44.213
So, is it time for you to sing?

16:44.296 --> 16:45.297
Yep!

16:45.923 --> 16:47.257
Oink, oink, oink

16:47.341 --> 16:49.384
This is my song

16:49.468 --> 16:52.638
I'm making it up as I go along

16:52.721 --> 16:53.931
It'll be about--

16:54.014 --> 16:55.682
Caw!

16:58.477 --> 16:59.937
Hit the brakes.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.856
The crows are so noisy.

17:02.940 --> 17:04.650
Oh, no.

17:04.733 --> 17:07.611
I thought this was just the right spot.

17:11.615 --> 17:14.992
I'll never find a spot
that's quiet enough for me to sing.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.714
Putt, puff, puttedy chuff.

17:27.798 --> 17:31.051
I'll help Celeste, and I won't give up.

17:31.134 --> 17:34.555
I've just got to use the gears
between my ears.

17:37.516 --> 17:38.767
Celeste, look!

17:38.851 --> 17:40.477
It's Farmer Naomi.

17:44.439 --> 17:46.733
She made the crows go, go, go.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.571
It's so quiet again.

18:02.499 --> 18:05.085
No! Now it's back to loud.

18:05.711 --> 18:08.922
Farmer Naomi left,
and the crows came back.

18:09.631 --> 18:11.300
But here she comes again.

18:13.927 --> 18:16.221
See? No more crows.

18:16.305 --> 18:18.557
Farmer Naomi's like a scarecrow.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.142
A what-who?

18:21.727 --> 18:25.355
A scarecrow looks like a person
but is really made of straw.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.194
I have an…

18:31.153 --> 18:32.154
idea!

18:32.779 --> 18:36.533
-You have a what?
-I have an idea!

18:37.701 --> 18:40.704
I know how we can keep
the pumpkin patch quiet.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.917
We get Farmer Naomi
to stand there all day?

18:45.918 --> 18:47.044
No.

18:47.127 --> 18:50.464
But we can build something
that looks like Farmer Naomi.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.341
A real scarecrow.

18:52.424 --> 18:53.926
It'll scare the crows away

18:54.009 --> 18:58.388
so you can finally have a nice,
quiet spot to finish your song.

18:58.472 --> 19:00.807
Yes, yes, yes!

19:00.891 --> 19:03.477
Let's get rolling to build a scarecrow.

19:04.478 --> 19:05.687
Come on, Otis.

19:10.943 --> 19:12.861
We can use these for the body.

19:17.783 --> 19:19.993
This barrel's really heavy.

19:20.702 --> 19:21.912
Hello.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.672
Look. I found some arms.

19:34.758 --> 19:36.760
Just a little tractor trick.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.807
The scarecrow needs her hat.

19:46.395 --> 19:49.064
Coming at you, Celeste.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.953
Let's make a scarecrow.

20:11.712 --> 20:13.505
Let's use this for the head.

20:25.350 --> 20:26.518
There.

20:26.602 --> 20:29.438
Is that you, Farmer Naomi?

20:29.521 --> 20:32.900
No. It's me, Scarecrow Sally.

20:36.278 --> 20:38.238
Do you think this will work?

20:38.322 --> 20:40.324
We're about to find out.

20:40.407 --> 20:43.160
Scarecrow Sally, do your thing.

20:48.999 --> 20:51.668
No more caws! We did it!

20:52.336 --> 20:54.338
Bye-bye, crows!

20:59.051 --> 21:01.595
This is the quietest spot
on the whole farm.

21:02.179 --> 21:04.681
Well, now it's the quietest.

21:04.765 --> 21:06.183
Ready to sing?

21:09.019 --> 21:10.354
Oink, oink, oink

21:10.437 --> 21:12.564
This is my song

21:12.648 --> 21:15.901
I'm making it up as I go along

21:15.984 --> 21:19.613
It'll be about something
Really special to me

21:19.696 --> 21:23.742
I just need a quiet place
To think of what that could be

21:23.825 --> 21:27.663
When this oink, oink pig
Wanted to make up a song

21:27.746 --> 21:31.166
This beep, beep tractor
Came rolling along

21:31.250 --> 21:34.795
Chuffing here, chuffing there
Chuffing up this hill

21:34.878 --> 21:37.506
You helped me build a scarecrow

21:37.589 --> 21:40.050
Now it's quiet and still

21:40.133 --> 21:41.885
So, oink, oink, oink

21:41.969 --> 21:43.554
Thank you, Otis

21:43.637 --> 21:47.391
I needed help
And it was nice of you to notice

21:47.474 --> 21:51.103
You're a hearty helper
In everything you do

21:51.186 --> 21:55.649
I'm so oink, oink happy
To be here with you

21:57.317 --> 21:59.444
I'm happy too

22:02.114 --> 22:05.909
Thanks for helping me find
a quiet place to sing, Otis.

22:05.993 --> 22:07.286
You got it.

22:08.453 --> 22:11.290
On this farm, we all help each other.

22:11.790 --> 22:12.791
Again.

22:12.875 --> 22:14.376
Oink, oink, oink

22:14.459 --> 22:16.503
This is my song

22:16.587 --> 22:20.174
I'm making it up as I go along

22:20.257 --> 22:23.927
It'll be about something
Really special to me

22:24.011 --> 22:27.556
I just need a quiet place
To think of what that could be

22:27.639 --> 22:31.310
You're a hearty helper
In everything you do

22:31.393 --> 22:36.148
I'm so oink, oink happy
To be here with you
