WEBVTT

00:01.449 --> 00:04.073
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.211 --> 00:07.179
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.317 --> 00:11.770
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.908 --> 00:14.669
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.807 --> 00:17.707
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.845 --> 00:21.676
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.471 --> 00:25.887
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.026 --> 00:28.649
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.787 --> 00:31.134
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.272 --> 00:33.861
Just to get up that hill

00:33.999 --> 00:36.415
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.553 --> 00:39.073
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.211 --> 00:41.558
As long as we live
it's you and me, baby

00:41.696 --> 00:43.319
Ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.457 --> 00:46.046
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.184 --> 00:48.945
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.083 --> 00:53.432
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.570 --> 00:56.401
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.539 --> 00:59.438
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.576 --> 01:04.409
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:11.588 --> 01:13.452
Beautiful day,
isn't it?

01:15.696 --> 01:17.560
Just like
Indian summer.

01:21.219 --> 01:23.807
George, I know you don't
talk much in the morning,

01:23.945 --> 01:26.983
but a friendly burp
now and then wouldn't hurt.

01:28.329 --> 01:30.469
Uh-huh.

01:30.607 --> 01:33.196
The least you could do is tell
me how you like the waffles.

01:33.645 --> 01:35.198
Oh, yeah.

01:35.336 --> 01:36.889
They're just as good
as the ones momma
used to make for me.

01:37.027 --> 01:38.443
Hmm, that's better.

01:38.581 --> 01:39.823
Which I hated.

01:41.687 --> 01:43.413
Why are you so grouchy
this morning?

01:43.551 --> 01:45.829
Because that dumb maid
Florence woke me up.

01:45.967 --> 01:48.729
Florence? She's not
even here yet. She's late.

01:48.867 --> 01:50.386
I know, but every
Tuesday morning

01:50.524 --> 01:52.112
she starts making
noise at 8:00.

01:52.250 --> 01:54.769
But this morning I didn't hear
nothing, and it woke me up.

01:57.047 --> 01:59.602
Ah, do you want
one lump or two?

01:59.740 --> 02:01.259
I already put sugar
in my coffee.

02:01.397 --> 02:03.226
I meant for your head.

02:05.194 --> 02:06.712
Will you look at this syrup?

02:06.850 --> 02:08.818
Them liberals
finally got their way.

02:08.956 --> 02:11.510
They changed Aunt Jemima
so much she looks
almost white.

02:15.859 --> 02:18.448
She is white.
That's Vermont maid.

02:26.284 --> 02:27.940
Now I know what's wrong
with these waffles.

02:28.078 --> 02:29.701
They taste old.

02:29.839 --> 02:31.323
I just made them.

02:31.461 --> 02:34.015
I know, but you just made
them in that burnt-up
old piece of junk.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.259
There's nothing wrong
with this waffle iron.

02:36.397 --> 02:37.881
Get a new one.

02:38.813 --> 02:40.988
Not while this one
is still working good.

02:41.126 --> 02:42.852
It would be
a waste of money.

02:42.990 --> 02:45.579
See, that's your
trouble, Weezy.
You don't think big.

02:45.717 --> 02:49.652
My mother said the same
thing when I told her
I was marrying you.

02:52.896 --> 02:55.036
All I'm saying is you don't
have to scrimp and save

02:55.175 --> 02:56.624
like we was poor folks.

02:56.762 --> 02:58.488
I don't scrimp
and save anymore.

02:58.626 --> 03:00.145
Oh, no?

03:00.283 --> 03:03.079
Then why do you save
these little twisty things
from the bread wrappers?

03:03.217 --> 03:05.564
Well, you never know when
they might come in handy.

03:05.702 --> 03:08.809
I can tell you when they come
in handy. New Year's Eve!

03:08.947 --> 03:11.881
Happy New Year's,
Weezy! Whee!

03:15.367 --> 03:18.612
Well, I'm glad you're
beginning to feel better.

03:20.165 --> 03:22.685
Oh, that must be Florence.

03:22.823 --> 03:24.928
Oh, I just started
feeling bad again.

03:29.070 --> 03:30.624
Where have you been?
Outside.

03:35.318 --> 03:36.871
I pay you to work inside.

03:37.009 --> 03:38.390
You should have been
here two hours ago.

03:38.528 --> 03:40.289
Why? What did I miss?

03:42.083 --> 03:43.740
One of these days you're
gonna come to work so late

03:43.878 --> 03:45.570
you're gonna pass
yourself going home.

03:47.399 --> 03:49.401
That's real smart,
Mr. Jefferson,

03:49.539 --> 03:51.438
especially for a man
with your brain.

03:53.612 --> 03:55.338
And if you had
any brains at all,

03:55.476 --> 03:57.133
you'd stop
getting so uppity.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.203
I'm sorry.

03:58.341 --> 03:59.446
Must be the
company I keep.

03:59.584 --> 04:01.896
I agree.

04:02.034 --> 04:04.451
I ought to try working for
a better class of employer.

04:04.589 --> 04:05.624
Say what?

04:05.762 --> 04:07.902
Have a nice day,
Mr. Jefferson.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.456
Now, you listen,
young lady...

04:13.770 --> 04:14.909
Good morning,
Mrs. Jefferson.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.532
You finished with
breakfast already?

04:16.670 --> 04:17.981
Yes, I am.

04:18.672 --> 04:20.432
Uh, you know, Florence,

04:20.570 --> 04:22.952
you shouldn't talk to
Mr. Jefferson like that.

04:23.090 --> 04:24.781
I can't help it,
Mrs. Jefferson.

04:24.919 --> 04:26.990
Him and me is like
a knife and fork.

04:27.128 --> 04:28.544
They both need each other,

04:28.682 --> 04:30.270
but they're always
scraping up
against one another.

04:31.478 --> 04:34.343
Still, you must remember
this is his home.

04:34.481 --> 04:36.241
You don't have to rub it in.

04:36.379 --> 04:37.553
What do you mean?

04:37.691 --> 04:38.899
Nothing.

04:40.487 --> 04:42.040
Do you want me
to clean this floor?

04:42.178 --> 04:43.973
I cleaned it
myself yesterday.

04:44.111 --> 04:47.287
Yesterday? Well, honey,
either you need shorter
legs or longer arms,

04:47.425 --> 04:49.496
because your mop sure
ain't reaching the floor.

04:54.501 --> 04:56.882
I only did it
to save you work.

04:57.020 --> 04:59.540
You don't have to save no work
for me. I got enough already.

05:01.231 --> 05:03.164
But didn't I do a good job?

05:03.303 --> 05:05.926
Sure you did.
You spread the dirt out
all nice and even.

05:08.273 --> 05:10.413
Uh, would you like
a waffle before you start?

05:10.551 --> 05:11.518
No, thanks.

05:11.656 --> 05:13.313
You sure?
I made it myself.

05:13.451 --> 05:15.315
No, thank you.
It'll only go to waste.

05:15.453 --> 05:16.592
Then let it go to waste,

05:16.730 --> 05:18.628
like everything else
goes to waste, damn it!

05:22.011 --> 05:24.427
All I did was
offer you a waffle.

05:24.565 --> 05:26.636
Is that all you got
to think about?

05:26.774 --> 05:29.190
Waffles, waffles, waffles!

05:31.503 --> 05:33.436
How do you feel
about pancakes?

05:39.960 --> 05:41.927
Oh, Mrs. Jefferson.

05:42.065 --> 05:43.929
Florence, what is it?

05:44.067 --> 05:45.793
Do you want to
tell me what's wrong?

05:45.931 --> 05:48.486
I'm getting thrown out
of my apartment!

05:48.796 --> 05:49.832
What?

05:50.936 --> 05:53.180
They're tearing
the whole building down.

05:53.318 --> 05:55.907
That's terrible.
Didn't they warn you?

05:56.045 --> 05:59.013
Oh, sure, they warned us.
They said, "Get out!"

06:01.119 --> 06:02.569
I'm sorry, Florence.

06:02.707 --> 06:05.123
No wonder you're so
uptight this morning.

06:05.261 --> 06:06.814
I've been uptight all week.

06:06.952 --> 06:10.473
10 years I've been in
that lousy, stinking hole.

06:10.611 --> 06:13.649
Well, if it's that bad,
maybe it needs tearing down.

06:13.787 --> 06:16.099
Mrs. Jefferson, you're
talking about my home.

06:20.794 --> 06:22.174
What are you going to do?

06:22.312 --> 06:25.833
Honey, if I knew that,
I could put Jeane Dixon
out of business.

06:25.971 --> 06:28.457
I don't know where I'm
going to find a new place.

06:28.595 --> 06:31.460
Would you like to take
the rest of the day
off to go looking?

06:31.598 --> 06:34.083
I don't think that would help.
Why not?

06:34.221 --> 06:35.567
I'll give you
three "Why-nots."

06:35.705 --> 06:38.950
I'm not a man, I'm not white,
and I'm not rich.

06:40.020 --> 06:42.505
Yeah. Rents have
gone crazy, all right.

06:42.643 --> 06:45.819
I can barely make
ends meet in the
old lousy, stinking hole.

06:45.957 --> 06:48.891
I sure can't pay
what they're asking for
new lousy, stinking holes.

06:52.135 --> 06:53.482
You know...

06:54.759 --> 06:56.933
Maybe I ought to
become a streetwalker.

06:57.865 --> 07:00.005
That's a terrible idea!

07:00.143 --> 07:02.698
Why? Don't you think
anybody would want me?

07:04.976 --> 07:07.461
Of course. You'd make
a wonderful streetwalker.

07:07.599 --> 07:10.291
Oh, so that's what
you think of me, huh?

07:13.156 --> 07:15.952
No. No. You'd make
a terrible streetwalker.

07:16.090 --> 07:17.437
What's wrong with me?

07:20.267 --> 07:22.407
Now, look, Florence.
If you're short of money,

07:22.545 --> 07:24.789
you could work here more than
one day a week, you know.

07:24.927 --> 07:27.101
You know Mr. Jefferson
wouldn't like that.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.344
Oh, yes, he would.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.208
Just a few minutes ago
he was telling me

07:30.346 --> 07:32.555
I should learn
how to spend more money.

07:32.693 --> 07:34.937
An extra day would be nice,
Mrs. Jefferson.

07:35.075 --> 07:37.767
But I still won't be able
to find a new place to live.

07:38.388 --> 07:41.184
Hey, wait a minute.

07:41.322 --> 07:44.671
I just thought
of someplace great.

07:44.809 --> 07:45.775
Where?

07:45.913 --> 07:46.949
Here!

07:47.087 --> 07:48.502
Now, don't be making fun
of me, Mrs. Jefferson.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.298
You know I can't afford
to rent a broom closet
in this building.

07:52.782 --> 07:55.440
No, no.
I mean here,
in our guestroom!

07:55.578 --> 07:58.029
You could be
our full-time maid.

07:58.167 --> 07:59.962
That way, you have
a place to live,

08:00.100 --> 08:03.931
a good salary,
and you'll never
be alone again.

08:04.069 --> 08:06.727
Oh, Mrs. Jefferson!
You're so beautiful!

08:13.769 --> 08:15.978
But what about Mr. Jefferson?
What's he gonna say?

08:16.116 --> 08:18.498
Oh, don't worry about that.
I'll handle him.

08:18.636 --> 08:21.155
Oh, thank you,
Mrs. Jefferson.
I'm so happy.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.985
I'm gonna work
my fingers to the bone.

08:23.123 --> 08:25.194
I'll work nights.
I'll work weekends.

08:25.332 --> 08:27.127
You'll see. I'm gonna be
the best maid there ever was.

08:27.265 --> 08:29.301
Now I'm gonna finish
these dishes, and when
I get through, I'm...

08:29.439 --> 08:31.545
Uh-uh. Hold it, Florence.

08:31.683 --> 08:33.685
We have plenty of time.

08:33.823 --> 08:36.585
Why don't we have a nice
hot cup of coffee first?

08:36.723 --> 08:38.448
That's a good idea,
Mrs. Jefferson.

08:38.587 --> 08:39.898
But coffee
jangles my nerves.

08:40.036 --> 08:41.521
Make mine tea.

08:50.253 --> 08:51.807
Weezy!

08:56.743 --> 08:58.710
Weezy!

08:58.848 --> 09:01.161
Oh, George, I'm glad
you're home.

09:01.299 --> 09:03.301
I've got some
wonderful news.

09:03.439 --> 09:06.338
My news is better
than wonderful. It's good!

09:06.476 --> 09:07.616
Remember how grouchy
I was this morning?

09:07.754 --> 09:10.204
I didn't notice
anything different.

09:10.342 --> 09:13.276
I know, Weezy.
That's because I try to stay
cheerful for you.

09:15.244 --> 09:17.695
But I was worried
about having to buy those
new vans for the stores.

09:17.833 --> 09:19.386
And now you're
not worried?

09:19.524 --> 09:20.732
No.

09:20.870 --> 09:22.700
Because I met a guy
who's going to
do me a big favor.

09:22.838 --> 09:26.462
He's going to sell me three
practically brand-new vans
for half-price.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.601
Why?

09:27.739 --> 09:28.982
Because he needs
the bucks.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.535
See, I got the bucks,
he's got the vans.

09:30.673 --> 09:32.537
So we make a trade.
Ain't that great?

09:32.675 --> 09:35.091
Yes, that was
a lucky break for you.

09:35.229 --> 09:37.197
Lucky break, nothing!
I make my own breaks.

09:37.335 --> 09:39.233
When it comes to deals,
my eye's out there looking,

09:39.371 --> 09:40.372
my ear's out
there listening,

09:40.510 --> 09:41.546
my nose is
out there smelling...

09:41.684 --> 09:43.375
And your tail
is out there wagging.

09:49.278 --> 09:50.244
Say what?

09:50.382 --> 09:51.867
You sound just like
a bloodhound.

09:52.005 --> 09:54.145
That's exactly what I am
when I'm out there
chasing them deals, Weezy.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.563
Well, I hope
you're housebroken.

10:00.220 --> 10:03.326
Look, will you stop
interrupting and let me
finish the story?

10:03.464 --> 10:05.294
See, I heard about
this dude who had these vans.

10:05.432 --> 10:07.365
And he was going to
give them to somebody else.

10:07.503 --> 10:08.815
So I tracked him down,

10:08.953 --> 10:10.989
and using my charm
and intellect,

10:11.127 --> 10:13.371
I was able to influence him
into letting me have them.

10:13.509 --> 10:15.131
Ain't you proud
of me?

10:15.269 --> 10:16.581
I certainly am.

10:16.719 --> 10:18.479
And I think you're
gonna be proud of me too.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.136
Oh? What did you do?

10:20.274 --> 10:22.414
Well, I've been
thinking about what
you said this morning.

10:22.552 --> 10:23.726
And you were right.

10:23.864 --> 10:25.659
I do scrimp and save.
Hmm!

10:25.797 --> 10:27.972
But it's hard to break
habits of a lifetime.

10:28.110 --> 10:29.559
You got to try, honey.

10:29.698 --> 10:33.805
I will. I've just been
so silly about little things.

10:33.943 --> 10:35.117
Hmm.

10:35.255 --> 10:37.533
Have you noticed
the toilet paper
in the bathroom?

10:37.671 --> 10:39.466
Only when it ain't there.

10:42.814 --> 10:45.058
Well, I've been
buying the cheaper kind

10:45.196 --> 10:47.267
just to save
a few pennies.
Hmm.

10:47.405 --> 10:50.132
But now I'm going to buy
the soft, fluffy kind.

10:50.270 --> 10:51.616
Nothing but
the best!

10:51.754 --> 10:53.273
Mmm-hmm. So this is
your great news?

10:53.411 --> 10:54.584
Buying fancy toilet paper?

10:56.483 --> 10:57.898
No.

10:58.036 --> 11:00.418
George, I've hired
a live-in maid.

11:00.556 --> 11:02.385
Now you're talking!

11:02.523 --> 11:05.319
You don't mind?
No. I think it's a great idea.

11:05.457 --> 11:07.045
Anything is better
than that thing we got.

11:10.290 --> 11:11.878
I just hope
she's a good one.

11:12.016 --> 11:13.258
Uh, George! Uh...

11:13.396 --> 11:14.708
She better be good.

11:14.846 --> 11:16.745
When I snap my fingers,
I want something to happen.

11:16.883 --> 11:18.712
You got it! Here I am.

11:31.311 --> 11:33.313
Uh, will you excuse us
a minute, Florence?

11:33.451 --> 11:35.625
I have something to discuss
with my wife in private.

11:37.524 --> 11:38.525
Thank you!

11:40.078 --> 11:41.770
You must be out of your mind!

11:43.392 --> 11:44.980
She ain't moving in with us!

11:46.119 --> 11:47.430
But, George,
I just hired her.

11:47.568 --> 11:49.536
Then just un-hire her.

11:49.674 --> 11:51.918
But I thought
you liked the idea
of a live-in maid.

11:52.056 --> 11:54.748
Ain't nothing wrong
with the idea.
It's the maid that's the drag.

11:55.887 --> 11:58.027
I can barely stand her
once a week.

11:58.165 --> 11:59.580
But she has
no place to go.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.203
Her building's
been condemned.

12:01.341 --> 12:03.688
I ain't surprised.
Look who's living in it.

12:06.070 --> 12:08.106
That's no way
to talk about Florence.

12:08.244 --> 12:10.799
Yeah, you're right, Weezy.
I don't even want to
talk about her no way.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.009
Give me one reason
why you don't want her.

12:14.147 --> 12:15.873
I'll give you three.
I don't like her,

12:16.011 --> 12:18.289
she don't like me,
and we don't like each other.

12:20.947 --> 12:22.811
You've gotta do
better than that.

12:22.949 --> 12:24.847
Okay, she's nosy,
she's bossy

12:24.985 --> 12:26.607
and she don't do
nothing I tell her.

12:27.401 --> 12:28.886
She's not nosy.

12:29.024 --> 12:30.957
Are you kidding?
She's got more nose
than an elephant.

12:31.095 --> 12:32.130
George!

12:32.268 --> 12:33.960
Look, Weezy,
I am an important
businessman.

12:34.098 --> 12:37.618
I need me a maid
who's gonna keep her
ears closed and her eyes shut.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.173
She's gonna bump into
a lot of furniture that way.

12:41.001 --> 12:42.106
You know what I mean.

12:43.003 --> 12:44.902
Y'all want me
to fix lunch now?

12:45.040 --> 12:46.455
We're still talking, dear.

12:48.319 --> 12:50.217
Can't you talk
over lunch? I'm hungry.

12:53.082 --> 12:54.428
Not yet, Florence.

12:54.566 --> 12:56.258
Well, talk faster, will you?

12:57.777 --> 12:59.675
See? She's bossy!

12:59.813 --> 13:01.504
I thought that
was very good.

13:01.642 --> 13:03.783
There's nothing wrong with
her wanting to fix lunch.

13:03.921 --> 13:07.062
And when I said no, she
obeyed my order right away.

13:08.373 --> 13:10.168
How about if I start
without y'all?

13:12.343 --> 13:14.586
My stomach's so empty
it's beginning to echo.

13:15.864 --> 13:17.106
Will you get back
in the kitchen?

13:17.244 --> 13:19.074
I'm getting.

13:19.212 --> 13:20.558
Look, the only orders
I want you giving her

13:20.696 --> 13:22.284
are her marching
orders, understand?

13:22.422 --> 13:24.010
But, George...

13:24.148 --> 13:26.426
I'll get it.
No, no. George.

13:26.564 --> 13:28.393
Let the maid
answer the phone.

13:28.531 --> 13:30.775
That's one of the good things
of having a live-in.

13:30.913 --> 13:32.501
She can screen
your calls for you.

13:32.639 --> 13:35.055
Oh, yeah.
That's classy,
ain't it?

13:35.193 --> 13:36.885
Get the phone, Florence!

13:37.471 --> 13:39.301
Florence!

13:39.439 --> 13:41.751
I can't talk to you now.
I'm answering the phone.

13:42.925 --> 13:44.616
See?

13:44.754 --> 13:47.757
Make sure she says,
"Jeffersons' residence"
every time she answers.

13:47.896 --> 13:49.173
It's for you, Mr. Jefferson.

13:49.311 --> 13:50.933
Oh, who is it?
How should I know?

13:51.071 --> 13:52.176
He's your friend.

13:55.248 --> 13:56.663
Hello, Jefferson speaking.

13:56.801 --> 13:59.424
Hey! Owens! Hey, it's good
to hear your voice.

13:59.562 --> 14:00.978
It's the guy I'm buying
the vans from.

14:01.116 --> 14:03.497
Yeah, let's meet
over here, downstairs.

14:06.535 --> 14:07.985
Get off the phone, you dummy!

14:09.262 --> 14:11.505
No, no, no! Not you, Owens!

14:12.713 --> 14:14.957
Sure! Before the banks close.

14:15.095 --> 14:17.097
Let's say 2:00.

14:17.235 --> 14:18.719
Good. Okay, Ciao.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.825
Did you see her
listening on the phone?

14:20.963 --> 14:22.758
She ain't no maid.
She's the FBI!

14:25.623 --> 14:28.522
She was only trying
to do a good job.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.800
Excuse me, Mrs. Jefferson,
but there's something
very important

14:30.939 --> 14:32.354
I got to ask you
about my work.

14:32.492 --> 14:33.769
Oh, sure.

14:35.046 --> 14:37.083
What is it, Florence?
What days am I getting off?

14:37.221 --> 14:40.293
Is that all you got
on your mind? Days off?

14:40.431 --> 14:41.881
No, I'd like
to talk about my money.

14:42.019 --> 14:45.091
Uh, Florence, you'd better
get back into the kitchen.

14:45.229 --> 14:46.471
And stay there!

14:47.714 --> 14:49.785
Give her a chance, George.

14:51.373 --> 14:53.099
Hold it, Weezy.

14:53.237 --> 14:55.618
Give the maid a chance,
like you said.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.762
Florence,
answer the door.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.075
Oh, no. You ain't
catching me like that.

15:04.213 --> 15:05.697
You told me to stay in here!

15:10.599 --> 15:12.083
I'm coming, damn it!

15:12.221 --> 15:14.568
She's only following
orders, George.

15:15.362 --> 15:17.088
Oh, hello,
Mr. Jefferson, sir.

15:18.469 --> 15:19.573
Here's the bags.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.161
I brought them up
as soon as they arrived.

15:21.299 --> 15:22.783
I knew you'd want it
that way, sir.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.234
Thank you
very much, Ralph.

15:25.372 --> 15:28.030
See, Weezy? This is
what I call good service.

15:28.168 --> 15:29.480
Why, thank you, sir.

15:29.618 --> 15:31.792
I know you always
appreciate it.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.279
These are
very heavy bags, sir.

15:35.417 --> 15:36.314
Put them right
over there, Ralph.

15:36.452 --> 15:37.764
Yes, sir.

15:37.902 --> 15:40.249
Very heavy.

15:40.387 --> 15:42.872
There. And, of course,
the elevator's not working.

15:43.011 --> 15:45.220
Oh, I'm sorry,
Ralph. Here.

15:45.358 --> 15:47.291
Oh, you don't have
to do that, sir.

15:47.429 --> 15:48.637
Well...

15:49.500 --> 15:50.984
Wait a minute!

15:51.122 --> 15:52.054
Whose bags are these?

15:52.192 --> 15:54.332
Why, Miss Johnston's, sir.

15:54.470 --> 15:55.851
Who's Miss Johnston?

15:56.610 --> 15:57.749
Your maid, Florence.

15:57.887 --> 15:59.303
A friend brought them
over for her.

15:59.441 --> 16:00.614
Florence?

16:00.752 --> 16:02.375
Yes, sir.

16:02.513 --> 16:05.757
I must congratulate you
on making Florence
your full-time maid.

16:05.895 --> 16:07.794
She's hard-working,
charming...

16:07.932 --> 16:08.968
She's a pain.

16:09.106 --> 16:10.900
And she does
get on one's nerves, sir.

16:14.111 --> 16:16.147
Did you tell her to have
her bags sent over?

16:16.285 --> 16:19.564
Well, no, but I guess
she thought it was okay.

16:19.702 --> 16:22.188
Well, guess what I'm thinking.
I'm thinking she's got
a lot of nerve,

16:22.326 --> 16:23.775
moving in here
without my permission,

16:23.913 --> 16:26.675
then listening in on
my private phone calls.
Fire her!

16:26.813 --> 16:28.263
I can't do that!

16:28.401 --> 16:30.437
Look, Weezy,
I'm going downstairs
for a business deal

16:30.575 --> 16:33.095
and when I come back,
I want to see
them outta here.

16:33.406 --> 16:34.476
Them?

16:34.614 --> 16:36.305
That bag
and her baggage!

16:40.068 --> 16:42.035
I'm not gonna do
your dirty work.

16:42.173 --> 16:44.244
If you want to fire her,
you'll have to do it yourself.

16:44.382 --> 16:46.246
I don't have time.
I gotta meet
Owens right now.

16:46.384 --> 16:48.179
You're scared to do it,
aren't you?

16:48.317 --> 16:50.147
Me, scared?
Yes.

16:50.285 --> 16:52.149
I'll show you
how scared I am.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.186
Florence, you're fired!

17:01.675 --> 17:03.746
Did I hear him say
what I thought I heard?

17:05.334 --> 17:08.717
That man of yours
sure makes some
weird jokes, don't he?

17:09.545 --> 17:12.065
Florence, he wasn't joking.

17:17.691 --> 17:19.245
Come on in, Mr. Owens.
Oh, thank you.

17:20.591 --> 17:22.179
That was real dumb of me
to forget my checkbook.

17:22.317 --> 17:23.594
Oh, that's all right.

17:23.732 --> 17:25.734
Louise! Louise?

17:26.976 --> 17:28.392
Wonder where
my wife's at?

17:28.530 --> 17:31.015
Oh, she's probably out
buying something for me.

17:31.153 --> 17:32.568
That woman's always
thinking about me.

17:32.706 --> 17:35.295
Why not? You're
a real likeable guy.

17:35.433 --> 17:36.952
That's why I'm glad
we're doing business.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.265
You know, I could have sold
them vans to somebody else

17:39.403 --> 17:40.956
for more than
you're paying,
but what the hell!

17:41.094 --> 17:43.062
And I can guarantee
you one thing.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.408
My check won't bounce.

17:44.546 --> 17:46.720
It might shiver
a little bit, but that's all.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.551
Thank you. Thank you.

17:50.931 --> 17:53.693
You're getting a real
good deal on those vans.

17:53.831 --> 17:56.523
I wish I was as smart
a businessman as you.

17:56.661 --> 17:58.284
Yeah, well...

17:58.422 --> 18:01.804
I mean, I should have known
better than to leave myself
short like that.

18:01.942 --> 18:03.116
If I could have just...

18:03.254 --> 18:05.118
Just held out
for another week.

18:05.256 --> 18:06.292
Well, couldn't you go
to a bank...

18:06.430 --> 18:09.605
Yeah sure, I could.
And I did, but they won't.

18:09.743 --> 18:11.745
Well, my loss is your gain,

18:11.883 --> 18:13.437
as the fat lady said
to the health club.

18:17.441 --> 18:18.925
Hey, that's a good one!

18:21.065 --> 18:25.656
Yeah. I tell you, though, this
worrying is giving me "Yoorz."

18:25.794 --> 18:27.865
What's "Yoorz"?
I'll have
a scotch and soda!

18:44.226 --> 18:47.056
It's an old one,
but it always works, huh?

18:47.195 --> 18:49.507
Yeah, I gotta try
that one sometime.
Yeah!

18:49.645 --> 18:51.406
You know something?
You're a nice guy yourself.

18:51.544 --> 18:52.855
Thank you.

18:52.993 --> 18:55.444
Yeah, that's one of
my secrets to my success,

18:55.582 --> 18:57.998
my ability to pick out
nice people like you.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.277
If there's one thing
I know, it's people.

19:01.864 --> 19:03.797
Hey, would you mind
helping yourself?

19:03.935 --> 19:05.385
Pour me one too.
Sure.

19:06.041 --> 19:07.698
Hello, Jefferson speaking.

19:07.836 --> 19:09.355
Who?

19:09.493 --> 19:12.012
Oh, yeah! He's here.
Hold it, hold it.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.083
It's your partner.
Oh, thank you.

19:16.983 --> 19:18.087
Yeah?

19:18.743 --> 19:20.228
No, not quite.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.231
In a couple of minutes. Why?

19:26.165 --> 19:28.477
Oh, fine, fine!

19:29.375 --> 19:30.721
Oh, yeah, yeah, I agree.

19:30.859 --> 19:33.137
Yes, I think we should
tend to that right away.

19:33.793 --> 19:35.139
Yeah, um...

19:35.864 --> 19:37.866
How's 15 minutes from now?

19:38.763 --> 19:41.352
I'll be there. Yeah, bye.

19:41.490 --> 19:43.941
Um, my partner says
to say hello to you.

19:44.079 --> 19:45.598
You know,
he likes you too.

19:45.736 --> 19:47.841
Ain't that nice!
And I never even met him.

19:49.015 --> 19:50.534
Oh, we can have
our drink now.
Yeah.

19:50.672 --> 19:53.157
Oh, Mr. Jefferson,
if you don't mind,

19:53.295 --> 19:54.710
could you make out
the check now?

19:54.848 --> 19:55.918
Sure, no problem.

19:56.056 --> 19:57.575
Something's come up.

19:57.713 --> 19:59.853
I'm gonna have to leave
sooner than I expected.

19:59.991 --> 20:02.960
You know, I feel
kinda bad, taking
advantage of you like this.

20:03.995 --> 20:05.894
Hi!

20:06.032 --> 20:08.483
Would y'all like to celebrate
your big business deal

20:08.621 --> 20:09.898
with a bottle of champagne?

20:10.036 --> 20:11.520
There's one open
in the kitchen.

20:11.658 --> 20:12.866
Florence, I fired you!

20:13.004 --> 20:15.386
I know. That's
what I'm celebrating.

20:17.043 --> 20:18.907
Well, what are you
still doing here?

20:19.045 --> 20:20.495
I had to finish
my cleaning.

20:20.633 --> 20:21.841
Ain't no sense
in Mrs. Jefferson suffering

20:21.979 --> 20:23.394
because you such a meanie.

20:24.292 --> 20:26.190
And such a bad speller too.

20:26.880 --> 20:28.227
Say what?

20:28.365 --> 20:31.022
You spelled your name wrong.
That check ain't no good.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.646
What are you talking about?
It says "George Jefferson"
Plain as day.

20:33.784 --> 20:34.785
That's what I mean.

20:34.923 --> 20:36.890
It should say
"George Pigeon."

20:38.651 --> 20:40.066
Say what?

20:40.204 --> 20:42.827
That's what his partner called
you on the telephone just now.

20:42.965 --> 20:44.760
And I know,
'cause I was listening!

20:53.666 --> 20:55.012
How dare you?

20:55.150 --> 20:57.117
Yeah,
how dare you?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.430
Why'd he call me a pigeon?
He didn't call you a pigeon.

20:59.568 --> 21:02.088
Oh, no? What else
would you call a turkey

21:02.226 --> 21:03.952
that had just bought
three vans

21:04.090 --> 21:06.851
that had been sitting
underwater for two weeks?

21:08.301 --> 21:09.371
Underwater?

21:09.509 --> 21:11.649
She's crazy!

21:11.787 --> 21:15.653
And his partner
said some other pigeons
they sold vans to

21:15.791 --> 21:16.999
was making trouble.

21:17.137 --> 21:19.554
That's how come they got to
get out of town tonight.

21:19.692 --> 21:21.970
She's a troublemaker.
I don't blame you
for firing her.

21:22.108 --> 21:25.111
Remember that flood they had
in Mississippi last spring?

21:25.249 --> 21:27.424
Well, them vans you
bought couldn't swim.

21:32.083 --> 21:34.016
You trying to sell me
damaged vans, Owens?

21:34.154 --> 21:36.743
There's nothing wrong
with the vans.

21:36.881 --> 21:38.193
You saw them yourself.

21:38.331 --> 21:40.437
Did you check
the ashtrays for mud?

21:42.128 --> 21:44.337
I was wondering why you was
letting them go so cheap.

21:44.475 --> 21:46.374
Owens, you're a crook.
Now, now, wait a minute.

21:46.512 --> 21:48.065
Are you gonna
listen to her?
She's drunk.

21:48.203 --> 21:50.412
Not drunk, just nosy.

21:52.172 --> 21:55.279
I heard these crooks
trying to rip you off.

21:55.417 --> 21:58.351
You trying to rip me off
and get away with it, Owens?
Get outta here.

21:58.489 --> 22:00.733
All right, now,
just a minute, buster.

22:00.871 --> 22:03.805
We got a deal and
you're gonna stick to it.

22:04.633 --> 22:05.669
What?

22:05.807 --> 22:07.222
Okay, buster,

22:07.360 --> 22:09.120
let me stick a few
left jabs in your eye.

22:34.836 --> 22:36.182
George, who was that?

22:36.320 --> 22:38.011
That was Owens.
He was just leaving.

22:38.149 --> 22:40.359
I could see that.
What I meant was...

22:40.497 --> 22:42.291
Never mind that.
Where you been?

22:42.430 --> 22:43.603
Upstairs.

22:43.741 --> 22:46.468
Oh, Florence,
I've arranged everything.

22:46.606 --> 22:49.057
You can start working for the
Willises tonight if you want.

22:49.195 --> 22:50.438
No, she can't.

22:51.300 --> 22:53.130
George, you can't stop
Tom and Helen

22:53.268 --> 22:54.718
from hiring
whoever they want.

22:54.856 --> 22:56.513
I can if I want
the same person.

22:56.651 --> 22:57.962
We're hiring Florence
back again.

22:58.100 --> 22:59.308
Not for the same
money, you ain't.

22:59.447 --> 23:00.620
I want me...

23:06.108 --> 23:08.179
I want me
a cost-of-living raise.

23:08.317 --> 23:09.905
You got it.

23:10.043 --> 23:11.251
What's going on here?

23:11.390 --> 23:13.737
We got us a maid, Weezy.
We got us a maid!

23:13.875 --> 23:15.635
We got us the nosiest maid!

23:18.466 --> 23:21.365
Just a minute, Mr. Jefferson!
Let me tell you
a thing or two!

23:24.126 --> 23:27.060
Now, you got yourself a maid,
but I ain't that kind of maid.

23:36.207 --> 23:37.312
FLORENCE:
Y'all awake yet?

23:37.450 --> 23:39.210
We are now.

23:39.348 --> 23:40.660
If you're asleep,
I'll go away.

23:40.798 --> 23:43.352
Oh, we're awake.
We're awake.

23:43.939 --> 23:46.114
Good. Breakfast time.

23:47.253 --> 23:51.188
Oh, isn't this nice, George?
Breakfast in bed.

23:51.326 --> 23:53.052
Yeah, that's kind of classy.

23:53.190 --> 23:54.502
There you are.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.469
Eggs benedict.
Great.

23:57.159 --> 23:59.092
Oh, I can't eat
all this.

23:59.230 --> 24:01.060
I'll just have
toast and coffee.

24:01.198 --> 24:03.234
There ain't no sense
in letting them
eggs go to waste.

24:03.372 --> 24:04.891
Skooch over,
Mrs. Jefferson.

24:08.239 --> 24:09.448
Pass me the salt, honey.

24:13.659 --> 24:16.109
Mmm-mmm!
Ain't this nice?

24:43.551 --> 24:48.003
LOUISE: The Jeffersons
was recorded on tape
in front of a studio audience.
