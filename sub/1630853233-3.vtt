00:11.040 --> 00:13.040
[ominous music playing]

00:13.600 --> 00:17.400
[Finn] "The dog wants to run."

00:17.480 --> 00:21.680
"The boy closs-es--"

00:21.760 --> 00:25.440
"Closs-es the gat."

00:25.520 --> 00:28.920
"The boy closes, E, the gate."

00:29.000 --> 00:31.200
-So the dog will stay in the garden?
-[door closing]

00:31.280 --> 00:32.960
[chuckling] I suppose so, yes.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.280
[James] Hello.

00:34.360 --> 00:35.200
Hi, Daddy.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.560
-[Sophie] Hi.
-Hey.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.880
Finn's just doing his reading.
We've got one more sentence.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.360
[James] Well, let's hear it.

00:44.320 --> 00:50.560
"The dog barks at the boy."

00:50.640 --> 00:52.080
-Best one yet.
-Well done.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.240
-Are you all done with homework then?
-Yes.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.120
Okay. I need to have
a quick chat with Mummy.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.840
-I'm hungry.
-[Sophie] Ugh.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.760
[James] Here.

01:05.080 --> 01:08.400
I don't know why she said that.
I don't even know if it's true.

01:08.480 --> 01:11.280
She said it was true.
She said she was in love with you.

01:11.360 --> 01:13.560
-Well, the feeling isn't mutual.
-[Sophie sighing]

01:13.640 --> 01:15.440
Wasn't and isn't.

01:16.560 --> 01:17.760
I want you to know that,

01:18.360 --> 01:19.600
for whatever it's worth.

01:20.920 --> 01:21.960
Really?

01:22.040 --> 01:22.880
Yes.

01:24.600 --> 01:25.800
It's worth a lot.

01:27.160 --> 01:28.480
I know that sounds silly.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.960
Well, I'm sorry
you had to sit through that.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.480
I'm sorry I left.

01:32.560 --> 01:33.640
Won't happen again.

01:35.240 --> 01:37.520
Tomorrow will probably be worse.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.120
Excellent.

01:39.640 --> 01:41.120
[both chuckling]

01:47.800 --> 01:50.360
Does she always stay this late
on a weekday?

01:50.440 --> 01:53.040
She doesn't distinguish between days.

01:53.120 --> 01:56.520
-[Kate] Do you think I can't hear you?
-Also, her ears are bionic.

01:56.600 --> 01:57.600
Would you like tea?

01:57.680 --> 01:59.440
-She hates tea.
-No. I hate tea.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.040
You should both go home.

02:01.120 --> 02:04.200
-So I was googling him.
-[Kate] Who, Brian?

02:04.280 --> 02:06.480
Well, that would make the opposite
of a juicy read.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.880
-Isn't that right, Brian?
-Quite right, miss.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.760
No. James Whitehouse.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.440
Has everyone seen those Libertine pics
of him with the PM?

02:14.520 --> 02:18.200
Yes. That all got featured
when Tom Southern was made party leader.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.160
What a bunch of pretentious arseholes.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.720
[scoffing] Now they're all
running the country, God help us.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.320
Do you think there's anything there?

02:24.400 --> 02:25.280
Where?

02:25.360 --> 02:28.280
I've heard those posh uni parties
went to extremes back in the day.

02:29.240 --> 02:31.760
Nothing that wouldn't qualify
as "boys will be boys."

02:31.840 --> 02:33.880
That's how it was when they were at uni.

02:33.960 --> 02:36.280
This case is about the here and now.

02:37.480 --> 02:39.800
I'm quite serious. Go and have a life.

02:39.880 --> 02:40.800
Both of you.

02:41.320 --> 02:42.560
Don't follow my example.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.880
Well, she's been convincing
so far, Olivia.

02:46.960 --> 02:49.000
Yes. The truth is always convincing.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.080
I've got a cab outside.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.720
Which way are you going?

02:56.800 --> 02:58.520
[Maggie] Don't worry, I'll take the tube.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.240
[dramatic music playing]

03:06.720 --> 03:10.080
May I remind you that you are still
under oath, Miss Lytton.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.640
Miss Woodcroft, you can continue.

03:17.720 --> 03:19.040
[Kate] Thank you, My Lord.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.280
-Miss Lytton.
-[Olivia] Yes.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.440
Can I take you back
to the 12th of October?

03:24.520 --> 03:25.600
The day in question?

03:26.480 --> 03:28.920
You were attending the Home Affairs
Select Committee together,

03:29.000 --> 03:30.040
is that correct?

03:30.120 --> 03:30.960
[Olivia] Yes.

03:31.680 --> 03:34.600
Did Mr Whitehouse
have any particular role in that meeting?

03:35.240 --> 03:38.160
James was due to give evidence
on the new immigration targets.

03:38.240 --> 03:40.040
A typical sort of day?

03:40.120 --> 03:41.280
Except he was upset.

03:41.800 --> 03:42.640
Why?

03:42.720 --> 03:46.160
There'd been an unfavourable
comment piece in The Times

03:46.240 --> 03:50.160
by a journalist he knew and rated,
a contemporary from Oxford.

03:50.240 --> 03:52.040
James thought it was deeply unfair.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.040
Poisonous.

03:55.160 --> 03:57.920
He was upset about the article.
How could you tell?

03:58.760 --> 04:00.960
[Olivia] When he saw the committee members

04:01.040 --> 04:04.240
in the Lloyd George Room,
no doubt having read the article, he said…

04:04.320 --> 04:06.000
I can't deal with this shit.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.280
Uh, can I say that?

04:08.360 --> 04:11.160
Oh, that's fine, Miss Lytton,
just tell us the words he used.

04:11.240 --> 04:13.160
So he said, "I can't deal with this shit."

04:13.240 --> 04:15.240
And charged off in the other direction.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.280
[Kate] What'd you do
when he charged off like this?

04:17.360 --> 04:19.000
-I followed him.
-Why?

04:19.080 --> 04:20.240
I was doing my job.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.560
[Kate] Did he acknowledge you?

04:22.080 --> 04:23.400
[Olivia] James.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.960
James.

04:25.040 --> 04:28.480
-What the fuck do they want with me?
-Wait. Wait. Please, I can't hear you.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.080
[elevator bell dings]

04:31.160 --> 04:32.680
[Kate] Where were you at this point?

04:32.760 --> 04:35.720
Next to the lift
where the assault occurred.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.240
Did he respond when you asked him to wait?

04:38.320 --> 04:39.760
[Olivia] He was short with me,

04:39.840 --> 04:42.080
but also somehow seeking reassurance.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.320
He… he seemed vulnerable for once.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.360
[Kate] In what way?

04:46.120 --> 04:48.200
-Do you think I'm arrogant?
-I--

04:48.280 --> 04:49.120
Do you?

04:49.720 --> 04:50.560
Do you?

04:50.640 --> 04:51.800
[Olivia sighing]

04:51.880 --> 04:53.480
I wouldn't use the word "arrogant."

04:53.560 --> 04:55.880
The article accused me
of being breathtakingly so.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.160
What do you think?

04:58.280 --> 05:01.440
I said, "I think you're ruthless
when you need to be."

05:02.200 --> 05:04.040
"Cruel sometimes, even."

05:04.120 --> 05:06.560
-And what did he say to that?
-He didn't like it.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.680
How could you tell?

05:07.760 --> 05:09.160
He repeated the word.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.440
[tense music playing]

05:10.520 --> 05:11.400
Cruel?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.440
[Olivia sighing]

05:13.520 --> 05:14.840
Yes, cruel.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.960
Then, after a moment, he said…

05:21.000 --> 05:21.920
I'm sorry.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.520
What did you think he was apologising for?

05:25.120 --> 05:26.920
The affair. The way he ended it.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.360
[Kate] Did you respond?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.560
I s-said that some-

05:32.640 --> 05:33.920
Could you…

05:34.000 --> 05:36.920
I said that sometimes arrogance
can be terribly attractive.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.800
[jury murmuring]

05:41.680 --> 05:43.120
What did you mean by that?

05:44.400 --> 05:47.600
And of course, we…
we know what the words mean, obviously,

05:47.680 --> 05:49.680
but what was your purpose in saying them?

05:50.280 --> 05:51.800
It was a test, I think.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.000
A test of what?

05:54.040 --> 05:56.680
I wasn't sure, to be honest. I…

05:57.280 --> 06:00.600
But I… I did want to know
what he wanted, and if he missed me.

06:01.480 --> 06:02.400
If he missed us.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.480
So you're next to the lift, talking.

06:09.560 --> 06:10.600
Then what happened?

06:11.240 --> 06:12.440
[elevator bell dinging]

06:12.520 --> 06:13.760
[tense music swelling]

06:13.840 --> 06:16.280
[Olivia breathing heavily]

06:17.560 --> 06:18.640
[Olivia] I asked him…

06:18.720 --> 06:20.040
Where are you going?

06:20.120 --> 06:21.160
[Kate] And what did he say?

06:21.240 --> 06:22.640
[Olivia] He didn't answer.

06:22.720 --> 06:25.040
[Kate] So you got into the lift
not knowing where you were going?

06:25.120 --> 06:27.600
Well, he made it clear
he wanted me to go with him.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.040
-How?
-With his body language.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.160
[breathing heavily]

06:32.240 --> 06:33.240
And what did you do?

06:34.080 --> 06:37.240
He was my boss, and we were at work.
I followed his lead.

06:37.320 --> 06:38.760
[breath echoing]

06:39.280 --> 06:41.720
So you get into the lift,
then what happened?

06:43.280 --> 06:44.440
[Olivia] James.

06:44.520 --> 06:47.320
We sort of collided and then we kissed.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.440
Collided?

06:48.520 --> 06:50.120
Or… or moved together.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.440
[both breathing heavily]

06:52.520 --> 06:53.480
An attraction…

06:54.080 --> 06:55.520
Were you still attracted to him?

06:55.600 --> 06:58.200
We'd been involved for five months.

06:58.280 --> 07:01.600
You don't just switch off your feelings.
At least, I don't.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.440
Can you describe the kiss?

07:07.480 --> 07:08.480
Was it a peck?

07:08.560 --> 07:09.400
No.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.480
[both breathing heavily]

07:12.200 --> 07:13.560
[Kate] What was it?

07:13.640 --> 07:14.480
Passionate.

07:16.320 --> 07:19.120
What was going through your head
when you were kissing?

07:19.200 --> 07:21.480
-[Olivia] I was happy at first, honestly.
-Why?

07:21.560 --> 07:23.440
Because it meant things might resume.

07:24.160 --> 07:27.560
And just to be clear,
what did you think might resume?

07:28.320 --> 07:29.240
The relationship.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.480
[suspenseful music playing]

07:38.480 --> 07:39.680
[Kate] Okay.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.600
Can you describe what happened next?

07:43.040 --> 07:43.880
He--

07:43.960 --> 07:46.720
-[both breathing heavily]
-[Olivia moaning]

07:46.800 --> 07:47.640
[Kate] Go on.

07:50.040 --> 07:53.480
He started wrenching
at the top buttons of my shirt

07:53.560 --> 07:56.240
to get into my bra to my breasts.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.360
[Kate] Okay. Can we take this in stages?

07:59.280 --> 08:02.040
So you've already told us
he was touching your breasts and bottom

08:02.120 --> 08:04.400
and wrenching your shirt
to get into your bra.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.240
Did he succeed?

08:06.880 --> 08:07.920
Yes, he…

08:09.880 --> 08:11.720
He grabbed one of my--

08:12.320 --> 08:13.400
My left breast.

08:14.320 --> 08:18.360
Pulled it out of my bra and began
to kiss and bite it quite savagely.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.400
-[Kate] Did it leave a mark?
-[Olivia] Yes.

08:20.480 --> 08:22.600
It left a bruise above my left nipple. I…

08:23.240 --> 08:24.320
I took a photo of it.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.640
That's Photograph A in your bundle.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.200
Miss Lytton,
could you point out the bruise?

08:33.160 --> 08:34.480
There, above the nipple.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.960
And what is that to the left of it?

08:38.200 --> 08:39.040
Teeth marks.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.880
Can I make it clear at this stage

08:40.960 --> 08:43.920
that the defence do not accept
that these are teeth marks?

08:45.280 --> 08:47.280
Are these teeth marks, Miss Lytton?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.200
Yes. He bit me.

08:51.560 --> 08:52.640
[man clearing throat]

08:55.360 --> 08:57.520
[Kate] Now,
can you describe the lift itself?

08:57.600 --> 08:59.240
[Olivia] It's a tiny wooden lift.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.520
It says it can hold six people,
but it can't possibly.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.680
My back was against the wall,
a-and he was in front of me,

09:04.760 --> 09:06.400
so I was… I was pushed--

09:06.480 --> 09:07.440
Pushed?

09:07.520 --> 09:10.240
Well, trapped against it.
I… I… I couldn't move.

09:10.320 --> 09:14.080
I think I yelped in shock,
uh, a-and I tried to push him away.

09:14.160 --> 09:16.400
-[James breathing heavily]
-[Kate] Did you say anything?

09:17.080 --> 09:18.280
"Not here."

09:18.880 --> 09:21.240
And again, we know
what the words mean in literal terms,

09:21.320 --> 09:24.160
but what did you mean
when you said "not here"?

09:24.800 --> 09:28.320
A kiss in the lift was one thing,
exciting, a bit dangerous,

09:28.400 --> 09:31.640
but… but then things changed
when he got forceful.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.760
How quickly did things change,
Miss Lytton?

09:33.840 --> 09:37.080
Seconds. When he started doing things
he'd never done before.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.280
Pulling my clothes off, biting me, and--

09:39.360 --> 09:41.360
[Kate] What did you think was happening?

09:41.960 --> 09:43.520
I don't know, but I was scared.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.040
[Kate] All right.

09:46.640 --> 09:48.600
Tell us, where does the lift go?

09:48.680 --> 09:50.760
Several places. It's a…

09:51.600 --> 09:53.480
it's a shortcut
to the committee room corridor.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.800
Is it a popular route?

09:54.880 --> 09:57.120
Anyone could have called the lift
and found us there.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.760
-[Kate] And were you worried about that?
-[Olivia] Yes.

09:59.840 --> 10:02.480
[Kate] What time did you have
to be back for the meeting?

10:02.560 --> 10:05.240
[Olivia] In minutes. I…
I didn't want him to be late, but he…

10:06.760 --> 10:09.320
-[Kate] But what, Miss Lytton?
-He wasn't listening.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.320
It was like he was possessed.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.400
[Kate] So, what were you feeling
at this point?

10:18.800 --> 10:19.720
Terrified.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.960
It was like I was no longer there.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.960
It's not just the physical aspect
of the assault, it's…

10:29.640 --> 10:31.360
It's what it does to you mentally.

10:33.680 --> 10:37.160
So in this state of terror,
after you'd said "not here"

10:37.240 --> 10:38.880
and tried to push him away,

10:39.720 --> 10:40.760
what did he do?

10:42.640 --> 10:44.200
[suspenseful music swelling]

10:44.280 --> 10:45.120
He--

10:46.000 --> 10:49.120
He tugged at my skirt, so it rode
over my bottom and up round my waist.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.400
[clothes tearing]

10:50.480 --> 10:51.640
[Kate] And then?

10:51.720 --> 10:53.280
[breath shuddering] He--

10:53.360 --> 10:54.760
-[James grunting]
-[Olivia] He just--

10:54.840 --> 10:55.880
[Olivia whimpering]

10:55.960 --> 10:58.920
I didn't know what was happening,
but I… I-- It was like I left my own body.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.480
I hesitate to interrupt you, Miss Lytton,
but could you look at Photograph B?

11:03.120 --> 11:04.120
[Olivia sniffling]

11:06.240 --> 11:08.240
[Kate] Can you tell us
what's in the picture?

11:10.880 --> 11:11.920
My underwear.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.440
[Kate] Is that how they looked
when you put them on that day?

11:16.160 --> 11:17.920
No. He ripped them.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.480
[Kate] How long
had you been in the lift by this point?

11:21.080 --> 11:22.600
[Olivia] A couple of minutes, if that.

11:23.880 --> 11:26.520
So when you were kissing,
were you consenting?

11:26.600 --> 11:28.160
Were you saying yes, essentially?

11:28.240 --> 11:31.280
Yes, but not at this point.
At this point, I was saying no.

11:31.960 --> 11:34.240
[Kate] So he rips
your tights and underwear.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.600
And then what happened?

11:39.960 --> 11:41.120
Then he…

11:41.200 --> 11:42.040
[Olivia gasping]

11:42.120 --> 11:43.320
…put his fingers…

11:45.160 --> 11:48.480
two of his fingers, his middle and index,
I think, inside me.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.040
And then what happened?

11:54.320 --> 11:55.240
Then he sort of…

11:57.160 --> 11:59.120
-…lifted me up against the wall…
-[Olivia gasping]

11:59.880 --> 12:00.720
…and, uh…

12:02.560 --> 12:03.760
shoved it inside me.

12:06.280 --> 12:08.960
He just shoved it inside me,
even though I didn't want it.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.960
Were you clear that you didn't want it?

12:12.040 --> 12:13.640
Yes. I was… [inhales deeply]

12:13.720 --> 12:15.120
…trying to push him away.

12:15.720 --> 12:16.840
Did he say anything?

12:18.080 --> 12:19.080
[sniffling]

12:20.880 --> 12:21.720
He said--

12:22.560 --> 12:23.440
He whispered…

12:25.240 --> 12:26.160
[smacks lips]

12:26.680 --> 12:27.960
…"Don't be such a prick tease."

12:28.680 --> 12:30.680
[breath shuddering]

12:31.800 --> 12:33.800
[suspenseful music playing]

12:36.200 --> 12:38.200
"Don't be such a prick tease"?

12:41.320 --> 12:43.040
Did he wait for a response?

12:47.800 --> 12:48.640
No.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.240
[exhales slowly]

12:51.880 --> 12:53.080
No. He just kept going.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.080
[Kate] So he whispered,

12:59.800 --> 13:01.680
"Don't be such a prick tease,"

13:02.800 --> 13:04.160
and he just kept going?

13:05.040 --> 13:08.320
[sniffling, crying]

13:13.360 --> 13:14.800
[sobbing]

13:17.240 --> 13:18.280
[Olivia sniffling]

13:21.880 --> 13:25.000
Perhaps this might be a good time
to adjourn for the day.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.240
[Olivia whimpering, sobbing]

13:28.800 --> 13:30.680
[clerk] Be upstanding in court.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.480
[Olivia sobbing]

13:35.880 --> 13:37.600
[dramatic music playing]

13:58.280 --> 13:59.480
[dishes clattering]

14:00.920 --> 14:02.080
[indistinct chatter]

14:02.840 --> 14:04.680
[Angela] Depressing to drink alone.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.160
-[Kate] I prefer it.
-I fear it.

14:07.240 --> 14:08.600
G&amp;T, please, Sam.

14:09.560 --> 14:10.480
You did well.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.000
-Tomorrow's another day.
-Indeed.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.200
You may not be open
to sharing a drink with me tomorrow.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.560
I'm not open to it now.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.640
[chuckles] This case
should never have been brought.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.240
It's as thin as a fucking wafer.

14:20.320 --> 14:22.160
Said the accused's barrister.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.680
And you usually shy away
from the high-profile ones.

14:24.760 --> 14:25.720
What, rapists?

14:25.800 --> 14:26.880
Cases.

14:26.960 --> 14:29.320
I don't care how high-profile he is.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.520
Another woman's been raped,
another woman deserves her day in court.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.440
Hmm. Sounding a little less
than impartial there, lovely.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.280
We're in a bar, not Court 2.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.760
Of course,
I'll leave that determination to the jury.

14:39.840 --> 14:40.840
[scoffing]

14:41.720 --> 14:45.560
Seriously, doesn't it ever wear you down?

14:45.640 --> 14:49.800
Well, I don't know how you can ask me that
when it's obvious I'm ageing backwards.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.600
Like Benjamin Button.

14:51.680 --> 14:52.840
[both laughing]

14:52.920 --> 14:55.000
Well, soon I'll look just like Brad Pitt.

14:55.080 --> 14:56.560
[gasps] Then we'll fall in love.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.280
-[both chuckling]
-Cheers.

14:59.000 --> 14:59.840
Cheers.

15:06.080 --> 15:07.920
[suspenseful music playing]

15:13.720 --> 15:15.720
[anchor speaking indistincly over radio]

15:17.280 --> 15:18.400
Is Angela ready?

15:18.920 --> 15:19.960
Chomping at the bit.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.000
-It's champing.
-What?

15:24.160 --> 15:26.840
She's champing at the bit, not chomping.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.600
[anchor] There are rumblings
this morning in Parliament…

15:29.680 --> 15:31.080
Would you turn that up, please?

15:32.040 --> 15:34.680
[anchor] …members of Prime Minister
Tom Southern's own party

15:34.760 --> 15:37.880
have been privately discussing
pursuing a vote of no confidence

15:37.960 --> 15:39.440
against his leadership.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.840
It's still unclear
how close the rebels are

15:41.920 --> 15:43.480
to reaching the tipping point,

15:43.560 --> 15:46.480
but one leading backbencher tells me
they're nearly there.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.680
Is this because of you?

15:49.680 --> 15:51.800
No. No. That's not possible.

15:53.360 --> 15:55.320
[anchor] Rumours
are swirling in Westminster

15:55.400 --> 15:58.080
regarding Prime Minister
Tom Southern's future.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.160
-[Tom] Fuck it.
-[anchor] Momentum appears to be building…

16:00.240 --> 16:02.240
-Is it Frisk?
-Why do you suspect Frisk?

16:02.320 --> 16:04.680
-He's unctuous and talks too much.
-He doesn't have the balls.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.320
I'm guessing we should focus
on the usual suspects.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.400
I don't want your guesses.
Why didn't you see this coming?

16:08.480 --> 16:10.120
I'm your comms director, not your Whip.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.200
I control your message,
not your fucking party.

16:12.280 --> 16:15.000
No senior member of government took a shit
this morning without your knowledge.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.480
Form and content.

16:16.560 --> 16:19.040
[Chris] You should publicly
distance yourself from Whitehouse.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.320
Why?

16:20.400 --> 16:22.400
Because the behaviour of entitled toffs

16:22.480 --> 16:25.080
is something the public
no longer finds cute.

16:25.160 --> 16:28.560
Our members are hearing from constituents,
not to mention fucking Labour.

16:28.640 --> 16:31.960
The last thing you need now
is a posh sex offender for a best friend.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.200
Chris, perhaps this is confusing for you,

16:34.280 --> 16:36.320
as someone who finds
the notion of friendship foreign,

16:36.400 --> 16:38.920
but I was raised
to stand by a mate when he's down.

16:40.840 --> 16:44.800
But if it comes to it, rest assured,
I will do what needs to be done.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.320
[indistinct chatter]

16:48.960 --> 16:51.440
-[Tom] Good morning, gentlemen. Ladies.
-[men] Good morning, Prime Minister.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.960
[suspenseful music playing]

16:59.400 --> 17:02.280
Miss Lytton,
I'll try not to keep you long,

17:02.360 --> 17:04.480
but there are some points
we need to check.

17:04.560 --> 17:05.720
Is that okay?

17:05.800 --> 17:06.880
[Olivia] Of course.

17:06.960 --> 17:10.240
You were in a sexual relationship
with Mr Whitehouse?

17:10.320 --> 17:11.160
[Olivia] Yes.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.360
And I think you told us

17:12.440 --> 17:16.480
that when you "collided" with him
in the lift, you still loved him.

17:17.280 --> 17:18.120
Yes.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.400
[Angela] But on the date in question,
you had split up, hadn't you?

17:21.480 --> 17:24.240
-Yes.
-And how did the split make you feel?

17:24.320 --> 17:25.280
Uh…

17:27.040 --> 17:28.040
Distressed.

17:28.120 --> 17:30.560
Were you still distressed a week later?

17:30.640 --> 17:33.040
Yes, but I was determined
to be professional.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.920
I made sure it didn't affect my work

17:36.000 --> 17:39.400
and that my colleagues,
especially James, weren't aware.

17:39.480 --> 17:42.320
[Angela] More than distressed.
You were angry, weren't you?

17:42.400 --> 17:44.320
-No.
-If you say so.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.040
-My Lord.
-Miss Regan.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.840
You said that in the committee corridor,

17:48.920 --> 17:52.360
Mr Whitehouse was preoccupied
about a comment piece in The Times

17:52.440 --> 17:53.800
that accused him of being arrogant.

17:53.880 --> 17:56.200
-Yes.
-[Angela] And you told him, here it is,

17:56.800 --> 18:00.240
that "arrogance
can be terribly attractive."

18:00.320 --> 18:02.560
-What did you mean by that?
-I already explained.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.840
I wanted to know
if he still had feelings for me.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.960
[Angela] Despite the fact
that things had ended?

18:07.040 --> 18:07.880
[Olivia] Yes.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.360
[Angela] And then the lift arrived,

18:10.440 --> 18:13.600
and he held the door open with his hand
and waited for you to enter?

18:13.680 --> 18:15.200
-I think so.
-You think so?

18:15.840 --> 18:17.920
It was your evidence only yesterday

18:18.000 --> 18:19.400
that when the lift door opened,

18:19.480 --> 18:21.600
he held it
and waited for you to go inside.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.200
Then yes. Yes, I was following his lead.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.600
I'd like to go over this again.

18:28.480 --> 18:31.360
After you told him
you found him terribly attractive--

18:31.440 --> 18:32.800
I said that about arrogance.

18:32.880 --> 18:36.400
Sorry. After you said
you found arrogance terribly attractive,

18:36.480 --> 18:38.760
you led the way into the lift?

18:38.840 --> 18:41.480
[Olivia] No. I didn't lead the way.
He was holding the lift open

18:41.560 --> 18:42.640
and he ushered me inside.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.880
-[Angela] But you went willingly?
-Yes.

18:45.480 --> 18:47.720
Even though the meeting
was starting in just a few minutes?

18:47.800 --> 18:48.800
[Olivia] Yes.

18:48.880 --> 18:51.280
[Angela] What did you think
he was doing, calling the lift?

18:52.240 --> 18:53.080
I don't know.

18:53.160 --> 18:56.000
Well, you had an affair with the man,
told him you found him terr--

18:56.080 --> 18:59.240
Sorry, his affect terribly attractive.

18:59.320 --> 19:02.880
And then he called the lift
and you entered, without question.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.720
You didn't assume
he was taking you somewhere private?

19:07.400 --> 19:08.640
I don't know. Perhaps.

19:08.720 --> 19:09.680
Perhaps?

19:10.720 --> 19:13.520
There was no reason for you
to get into that lift together, was there?

19:15.360 --> 19:17.640
You were hoping
he was taking you somewhere private.

19:18.280 --> 19:19.760
Yes.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.080
[jury murmuring]

19:22.800 --> 19:25.360
[Angela] So once in the lift, you kiss.

19:25.960 --> 19:26.800
Yes.

19:26.880 --> 19:29.280
-[Angela] A passionate kiss, you said?
-Yes.

19:29.360 --> 19:32.440
So you were passionately kissing
when he put his hand on your bottom.

19:32.520 --> 19:33.440
Yes.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.480
-And opened your blouse?
-He wrenched it open.

19:36.560 --> 19:38.200
While you were kissing passionately.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.720
-Uh, were there any buttons missing?
-No.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.640
-Was it torn?
-[Olivia] No.

19:43.720 --> 19:46.280
[Angela] So did he wrench it
or pull it apart?

19:46.360 --> 19:48.320
He wrenched it. It was forceful.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.000
-But the blouse remained unharmed?
-Yes.

19:51.080 --> 19:52.600
I'd love to know the brand.

19:52.680 --> 19:53.960
-[Kate sighing]
-[jury laughing]

19:54.040 --> 19:56.600
Forgive me,
it just sounds like it's well made.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.280
So your blouse is open

19:58.360 --> 20:02.480
and he gives you what might be called
a love bite above your left nipple.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.080
I… I told you, he hurt me.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.840
It left a bruise.

20:05.920 --> 20:08.440
We submit
that it is often the nature of such bites,

20:08.520 --> 20:10.240
bites of passion, to bruise.

20:11.280 --> 20:13.680
But, point of clarification,

20:14.280 --> 20:16.000
is it only at this stage,

20:16.080 --> 20:18.920
when he has his mouth on your breast,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.280
that you say "not here"?

20:21.880 --> 20:23.280
-Yes.
-[Angela] And just--

20:23.800 --> 20:27.320
I'm just checking your statement here,
your words.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.360
You didn't say "stop it."

20:29.440 --> 20:30.560
You didn't say "no."

20:30.640 --> 20:33.680
Even when your shirt is open,
you just say "not here."

20:34.520 --> 20:37.560
I said, "not here,"
meaning "no, not here."

20:37.640 --> 20:40.680
But you didn't actually
say the word "no" did you?

20:40.760 --> 20:42.840
No, but I was trying to push him off.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.280
You said you were worried
someone might see you?

20:47.360 --> 20:49.240
Would've been acutely embarrassing, yes.

20:49.320 --> 20:52.520
So despite the fact
that he'd wrenched open your blouse

20:52.600 --> 20:55.120
and, as you say, bruised your nipple,

20:55.200 --> 20:58.600
your primary concern was about being seen?

20:58.680 --> 21:00.040
Just at that moment.

21:00.120 --> 21:01.240
[Angela] Hmm.

21:02.880 --> 21:04.600
[tense music playing]

21:07.920 --> 21:13.320
But this wasn't the first time
you'd had sex with Mr Whitehouse

21:13.400 --> 21:15.240
in the House of Commons, was it?

21:15.320 --> 21:16.880
[indistinct murmuring]

21:25.360 --> 21:26.760
I don't know why that's relevant.

21:26.840 --> 21:28.080
Oh I think you do.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.640
Yeah… Miss Regan, that is a comment.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.600
Back to the question,

21:32.680 --> 21:34.680
which I take no pleasure in asking.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.200
Let's try it this way.

21:37.880 --> 21:43.080
If I can ask you to cast your mind back
a fortnight before this incident.

21:43.160 --> 21:47.720
You met Mr Whitehouse in his office
at just after 9 p.m.?

21:47.800 --> 21:48.640
Yes.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.200
You were due
to go to a friend's leaving party.

21:51.280 --> 21:55.600
Your colleague, Kitty Ledger,
was waiting for you in the Red Lion.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.120
But you were late for her, weren't you?

21:58.200 --> 21:59.120
A little, yes.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.720
And why was that?

22:05.040 --> 22:06.840
The reason you were late for her

22:06.920 --> 22:10.640
was because you were having sex
with Mr Whitehouse in his office,

22:10.720 --> 22:11.600
weren't you?

22:11.680 --> 22:12.600
[sighs nervously]

22:13.800 --> 22:14.840
Yes.

22:14.920 --> 22:16.120
[jury murmuring]

22:16.200 --> 22:18.400
You performed oral sex on him

22:18.480 --> 22:22.320
and then had full sexual intercourse
on his desk.

22:22.840 --> 22:23.760
Yes.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.480
Anyone could have walked in,
couldn't they?

22:25.560 --> 22:26.480
Yes.

22:26.560 --> 22:30.960
And, two days before that,
in the BBC recording studio,

22:31.040 --> 22:33.800
you met Mr Whitehouse there at 9 p.m.

22:35.880 --> 22:39.440
Did you meet Mr Whitehouse
in the recording studio

22:39.520 --> 22:41.720
and have sex with him?

22:42.320 --> 22:43.720
[Olivia breathing nervously]

22:50.680 --> 22:53.840
Miss Lytton,
I'm afraid you must answer the question.

22:56.600 --> 23:00.160
For the sake of the court recording,
Miss Lytton is nodding.

23:00.240 --> 23:03.520
And once again, anyone, press included,

23:03.600 --> 23:04.840
could have walked in?

23:05.960 --> 23:06.800
Yes.

23:07.400 --> 23:12.480
And this is part of a pattern
of reckless sex in the workplace.

23:12.560 --> 23:13.720
No.

23:13.800 --> 23:15.080
Sorry, Miss Lytton?

23:15.800 --> 23:18.760
No, the first two times
were consensual sex.

23:18.840 --> 23:19.920
Sex we both wanted.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.280
We are talking about
something very different here.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.520
But you'd had sex in the workplace

23:24.600 --> 23:28.040
on two occasions
within weeks of this incident in the lift.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.200
Yes or no?

23:31.320 --> 23:32.480
Yes.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.160
Yes. Yes.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.320
Your torn underwear, Miss Lytton,

23:41.400 --> 23:42.280
[Olivia scoffing]

23:42.840 --> 23:44.400
…it's made of thin material.

23:44.480 --> 23:47.200
It's very easily ripped
in a moment of passion,

23:47.280 --> 23:48.240
wouldn't you agree?

23:49.480 --> 23:50.720
Or was it already torn?

23:50.800 --> 23:52.400
It wasn't. It was brand-new.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.400
Or could you have torn it
while you were ripping it off?

23:54.480 --> 23:57.800
No, I did-- I didn't want it,
and I told him I didn't want it.

23:57.880 --> 24:01.240
But you just told this jury
you didn't say "no."

24:01.320 --> 24:02.760
Not the word, perhaps, but I was--

24:02.840 --> 24:03.680
Not…

24:04.880 --> 24:05.720
the word.

24:06.840 --> 24:07.920
[jury murmuring]

24:10.000 --> 24:11.400
[dramatic music playing]

24:11.480 --> 24:14.040
[Angela] I'd like you to look
at your statement, please.

24:17.400 --> 24:20.560
Could you please confirm, Miss Lytton,
that this is the statement that you made

24:20.640 --> 24:22.640
on the 29th of October to the police.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.720
And is that your signature at the bottom?

24:24.800 --> 24:25.640
Yes, it is.

24:25.720 --> 24:29.440
Can you please go to page four,
paragraph two.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.560
Now, this is very important,

24:34.640 --> 24:36.920
so I want you to make absolutely sure.

24:37.840 --> 24:40.280
No one wants to put words in your mouth

24:40.360 --> 24:42.600
or take any away from you.

24:44.040 --> 24:46.200
Do you see the section which reads,

24:46.880 --> 24:48.880
"he shoved himself inside me,

24:48.960 --> 24:51.760
even though I told him 'not here'"?

24:51.840 --> 24:52.680
Yes.

24:52.760 --> 24:55.800
Can you confirm
that is what you said to the police?

24:57.320 --> 24:58.400
Yes.

25:00.120 --> 25:02.840
Do you see the word "no"

25:02.920 --> 25:05.720
in that part of your statement?

25:08.920 --> 25:10.600
Take your time, please.

25:13.800 --> 25:14.760
Anywhere at all?

25:18.400 --> 25:19.240
No.

25:25.720 --> 25:27.360
You never said "no,"

25:27.440 --> 25:30.200
because you did not want him
to stop, did you?

25:30.280 --> 25:31.440
It wasn't like that.

25:31.520 --> 25:35.600
But you've just told us it was exactly
like that between the two of you.

25:35.680 --> 25:36.640
Dangerous.

25:37.640 --> 25:38.760
Exciting.

25:38.840 --> 25:41.360
-You told us. Isn't that right?
-That was before.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.480
The truth is, Miss Lytton,

25:44.000 --> 25:48.520
there was no journey
from "yes" to "no" in that lift,

25:49.600 --> 25:52.640
because you only ever said "yes"
to Mr Whitehouse.

25:53.880 --> 25:56.840
The journey was stationary.

25:57.760 --> 25:58.640
From "yes"

25:59.880 --> 26:01.000
to "yes."

26:01.080 --> 26:02.840
[tense music playing]

26:04.240 --> 26:05.200
[Olivia exhales sharply]

26:24.720 --> 26:25.880
[Sophie inhales deeply]

26:37.960 --> 26:39.600
[tense music swelling]

26:45.680 --> 26:47.680
[breathing heavily]

26:50.640 --> 26:51.480
[James] Boom.

26:52.080 --> 26:53.760
[Finn] No. That's cheating!

26:53.840 --> 26:55.040
-[Emily] Daddy!
-[Finn] Cheater!

26:55.120 --> 26:56.560
[James] How dare you.

26:56.640 --> 26:59.280
It's not cheating. I've got
a "Get out of jail free" card right here.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.480
-'Cause you keep extras.
-In your wallet.

27:01.560 --> 27:02.520
How dare you.

27:02.600 --> 27:05.640
The only thing I keep in my wallet
is a picture of you, and you, and Mummy.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.400
Look, the prince, the princess,
and the queen.

27:09.000 --> 27:09.960
What's that?

27:10.040 --> 27:11.720
"Advance to Mayfair"?

27:11.800 --> 27:13.760
Well, that could come in handy.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.920
"Advance to Go."

27:16.000 --> 27:17.160
Lovely.

27:17.240 --> 27:21.320
And "A bank error in your favour,
collect £200." Excellent.

27:21.400 --> 27:22.600
-Cheater!
-[Emily] Daddy!

27:22.680 --> 27:24.680
That card doesn't even exist.

27:24.760 --> 27:25.760
What's this?

27:26.280 --> 27:27.120
Oh!

27:27.760 --> 27:28.880
"Get out of jail free."

27:28.960 --> 27:30.840
You've got one too. Never have enough.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.320
-[Emily] Daddy.
-Oh!

27:33.400 --> 27:35.280
Whoa! Elder abuse.

27:36.160 --> 27:38.520
-Daddy, you were cheating.
-Naughty Daddy.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.400
-You cheated.
-[Finn] Cheater.

27:40.480 --> 27:41.640
-Cheater.
-[James] Help!

27:41.720 --> 27:43.920
-[Emily] Daddy, you cheated.
-[Finn] Cheater.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
[Finn groaning]

27:45.880 --> 27:47.040
[Finn] Naughty Daddy.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.200
[Emily] Daddy.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.280
[James] I've never been
so exhausted from sitting.

27:53.360 --> 27:54.360
Feels endless.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.520
I know. Time's gone blurry, hasn't it?

27:57.040 --> 27:59.240
Isn't tonight usually your PTA meeting?

27:59.880 --> 28:02.280
I haven't gone in months.
Haven't you noticed?

28:02.360 --> 28:05.160
But you were so enthusiastic
about the auction.

28:05.240 --> 28:06.360
Why did you quit?

28:07.000 --> 28:08.080
I didn't quit.

28:09.920 --> 28:10.800
I didn't quit.

28:13.280 --> 28:14.760
-[knocking on door]
-[doorbell ringing]

28:14.840 --> 28:16.800
-Who the fuck's that?
-Press?

28:17.240 --> 28:18.160
Chris Clarke?

28:18.240 --> 28:19.600
[knocking continues]

28:19.680 --> 28:21.120
[doorbell ringing]

28:21.200 --> 28:23.200
Don't answer the door if it's a reporter.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.320
Or God forbid, Clarke.

28:27.920 --> 28:29.240
-Chris.
-[Sophie] Ugh.

28:30.600 --> 28:31.760
Shall we have a key made?

28:31.840 --> 28:34.120
-[Chris] You said you told me everything.
-I did.

28:34.200 --> 28:37.160
-What's this about?
-You might not want to hear this, Sophie.

28:37.240 --> 28:39.680
-Don't go anywhere. I've nothing to hide.
-Suit yourself.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.680
-There's another one.
-Another what?

28:41.760 --> 28:42.800
Accusation.

28:42.880 --> 28:44.520
What on earth are you talking about?

28:44.600 --> 28:47.200
An administrator from Oxford
went to the police and claimed

28:47.280 --> 28:50.560
that when you were at university,
a girl said you'd assaulted her.

28:50.640 --> 28:51.720
Well, that's absurd.

28:51.800 --> 28:54.880
Well, the girl chose not to pursue it,
and the administrator couldn't force her,

28:54.960 --> 28:56.680
but hearing about the trial,

28:56.760 --> 28:58.880
she came forward
thinking it might be relevant.

28:58.960 --> 29:01.400
-Who came forward?
-The administrator.

29:01.480 --> 29:03.640
You're just lucky I have police contacts

29:03.720 --> 29:06.280
in every fucking county
willing to give me a heads-up.

29:06.360 --> 29:08.720
Willing to pass along lies.
This is nonsense.

29:08.800 --> 29:10.720
Well, unless it's utterly verifiable.

29:10.800 --> 29:11.760
Where's the girl?

29:12.800 --> 29:15.280
They haven't located her yet.
She moved abroad apparently.

29:15.360 --> 29:16.440
So let me get this straight.

29:16.520 --> 29:19.120
You come here, at this hour, to my house,

29:19.200 --> 29:22.840
in order to tell me
about a hearsay assault from decades ago

29:22.920 --> 29:26.000
on a girl I don't know
and who you haven't even spoken to.

29:26.080 --> 29:27.040
Do I have that right?

29:27.640 --> 29:31.040
They haven't been able to locate her
because there's no such person.

29:31.640 --> 29:32.480
Holly Berry.

29:32.560 --> 29:33.840
[ominous music playing]

29:34.760 --> 29:36.840
[Chris] That's
the Oxford girl's name apparently.

29:36.920 --> 29:39.200
-[James] What kind of name is that?
-Holly?

29:39.800 --> 29:43.000
-Did you know her?
-She was my first-year tutorial partner.

29:45.840 --> 29:46.880
She went to Oxford?

29:47.760 --> 29:49.080
Don't you remember her?

29:49.160 --> 29:50.080
Holly Berry.

29:50.840 --> 29:51.720
No.

29:54.240 --> 29:55.880
[Chris] Brilliant, that's all I needed.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.120
-Thank you.
-Where are you going?

29:57.200 --> 30:00.440
To tell the PM to do what he should've
done long ago, as far as you're concerned.

30:00.520 --> 30:02.040
Publicly cut ties.

30:02.880 --> 30:04.960
It's over, mate.

30:08.960 --> 30:09.800
James.

30:10.400 --> 30:11.320
One moment, honey.

30:20.760 --> 30:22.760
[breathing heavily]

30:30.000 --> 30:30.920
[glass breaking]

30:32.360 --> 30:34.440
-[sighing heavily]
-[Krystyna] Let me help you.

30:34.520 --> 30:36.640
How about giving your employer
some privacy for once?

30:36.720 --> 30:38.280
That would be extremely fucking helpful.

30:44.600 --> 30:45.480
[exhales sharply]

30:51.200 --> 30:52.640
[James] How are you holding up?

30:53.800 --> 30:55.560
I was about to ask the same of you.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.880
[James] We had a good day, actually.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.280
My counsel is effective.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.120
Good. Good.

31:03.040 --> 31:05.760
I just had a visit from Chris.

31:06.960 --> 31:09.160
He told me he was gonna speak with you.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.360
What a bizarre thing.

31:11.440 --> 31:14.120
Bizarre because
it never happened, Tom. It's fiction.

31:15.120 --> 31:17.760
But it seems
we are both dealing with nonsense.

31:18.640 --> 31:22.280
The no-confidence motion,
is it Frisk that's poisoning the well?

31:23.480 --> 31:25.800
Oh it's much bigger than Frisk.

31:25.880 --> 31:27.800
Is it the budget impasse?

31:29.680 --> 31:32.160
It's you, actually.

31:33.000 --> 31:33.840
You're the problem.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.000
They're out for blood.

31:37.080 --> 31:39.080
[tense music playing]

31:40.440 --> 31:42.000
Who, our guys?

31:42.080 --> 31:43.600
[Tom] Chris says they're demanding

31:43.680 --> 31:46.120
I make a statement
expressing deep concern,

31:46.200 --> 31:49.920
and that I remove the Whip
from an accused rapist.

31:50.520 --> 31:53.040
-You can't.
-[Tom] Well, I'd rather not, obviously.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.440
You can't.

31:55.040 --> 31:55.920
I mean it.

31:57.440 --> 31:58.480
Is that a threat?

31:58.560 --> 31:59.840
Of course it's not a threat.

31:59.920 --> 32:02.840
It's a statement, a fact.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.600
I didn't do anything wrong.

32:04.680 --> 32:06.560
[Tom] Your trial
will surely confirm as much.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.440
But I have the Commons to answer to.

32:09.840 --> 32:14.240
And then this latest thing, James,
has become a tipping point.

32:14.880 --> 32:17.760
Tom, please don't make me say it.

32:18.680 --> 32:19.920
Well, say what?

32:21.520 --> 32:22.520
You owe me.

32:24.560 --> 32:25.840
So you are threatening me?

32:25.920 --> 32:28.680
I didn't do what I'm accused of.
