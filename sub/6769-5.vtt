WEBVTT

00:06.673 --> 00:07.590
Welcome home, Brandon.

00:07.674 --> 00:08.967
One last load,
everything'll be at the store.

00:09.050 --> 00:09.926
Right, right.
"The store"?

00:10.009 --> 00:13.138
Yeah, Donna and I
are opening a boutique.

00:13.221 --> 00:15.557
Tomorrow. Oh, which
reminds me, Matt called.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.267
{\an1}Matt?
And he's sending

00:17.350 --> 00:19.227
the articles of incorporation
over for us to sign.

00:19.310 --> 00:21.771
Great. I'll be over right after
my meeting with Leah, okay?

00:21.855 --> 00:22.939
Okay, bye-bye.

00:23.022 --> 00:24.274
Who's Leah?

00:24.357 --> 00:25.525
Oh, Leah. She...

00:25.608 --> 00:26.943
Oh, it's a long story.

00:27.026 --> 00:29.946
{\an5}Once upon a time,
there was a girl named Leah.
How was New York?

00:30.029 --> 00:31.156
New York was great.

00:31.239 --> 00:33.158
We should, uh...
we should talk about it.

00:33.241 --> 00:35.285
Yeah, yeah, that's great.
Um, how's later for you?

00:35.368 --> 00:37.454
{\an5}'Cause I was just running out.
Later's fine.
I can always

00:37.537 --> 00:39.247
tell you later
I was offered a job

00:39.330 --> 00:40.457
in the Washington bureau
of a major

00:40.540 --> 00:42.292
{\an1}metropolitan newspaper.
You were?

00:42.375 --> 00:43.543
Yep.

00:44.586 --> 00:47.297
Wow.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.298
That's so good.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.508
They were talking about L.A.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.178
and then they read my clips
and we started talking and...

00:53.261 --> 00:54.512
No, yeah, yeah.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.306
Washington's perfect.

00:56.389 --> 00:57.974
They want me
to start right away.

00:58.057 --> 00:59.142
That's great.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.186
Want to help me to my car?

01:02.395 --> 01:05.690
{\an1}Kel, I'm, uh...
I'm going to move.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.984
I know.
I think that's a good thing

01:08.067 --> 01:09.319
{\an3}for you.

01:09.402 --> 01:10.487
Can you hold these?

01:10.570 --> 01:12.447
Great. Thanks.

01:23.082 --> 01:25.710
{\an1}Ivy league member,
four letters...

01:25.794 --> 01:27.337
Yale.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.547
Blocked it completely.

01:29.631 --> 01:32.342
Rejection will do that.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.844
(clears throat)
Hi.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.888
I'm Valerie Malone.

01:36.971 --> 01:39.182
{\an5}Hi.
I'm friends
with Donna and Kelly.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.017
{\an1}Donna and Kelly, yeah.
Two great people.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.560
{\an1}And they make referrals,
too-- a plus.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.187
They don't know I'm here
and I really

01:44.270 --> 01:45.313
{\an3}don't want
them to know.

01:45.396 --> 01:47.524
Then they won't.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.067
I'm sorry--
please, have a seat.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.194
Thanks.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.279
Um...

01:55.573 --> 01:56.991
I want to hire you.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.160
Okay.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.662
Why?

02:02.288 --> 02:04.874
Because anything I say to you,
I want it to be confidential.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.044
Our conversation
is officially privileged.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.045
Unless you tell me
you're going to kill someone.

02:10.128 --> 02:11.297
And if I already did?

02:12.465 --> 02:15.051
I killed my father

02:15.134 --> 02:16.761
and I think my mother's
going to turn me in.

02:16.845 --> 02:19.180
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

02:19.264 --> 02:21.391
He was raping me,

02:21.474 --> 02:23.351
over and over.

02:23.434 --> 02:24.936
I finally resisted.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.354
He took out a gun.

02:26.437 --> 02:28.565
We struggled, he died.
And?

02:28.648 --> 02:30.316
And what else
do you need to know?

02:30.400 --> 02:32.485
A lot... if you're
going to be acquitted.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.945
It was justifiable homicide.

02:34.028 --> 02:36.739
Well, so you say,
but a court may say different.

02:36.823 --> 02:37.782
Well, I don't see how.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.701
Sure you do
or you wouldn't be here.

02:39.784 --> 02:42.036
So what do you say I should do?

02:42.120 --> 02:43.246
Hope your mother
will stay quiet

02:43.329 --> 02:45.373
and protect you.
If she doesn't?

02:45.456 --> 02:46.249
If she doesn't,

02:46.332 --> 02:48.877
hope for a sympathetic jury.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.341

03:18.448 --> 03:20.950

03:47.852 --> 03:49.854

JANET:
<i>Uh, well, I don't know where</i>

04:33.481 --> 04:34.148
Sophie is but I, I bet

04:34.232 --> 04:36.150
{\an3}I know how
you can reach her.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.613
What's the matter,
a little trouble in paradise?

04:42.073 --> 04:44.367
Nah, I just haven't, uh,
seen Sophie in a few days.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.910
{\an6}I'm worried.
Ah, you should've
thought of that

04:45.994 --> 04:47.745
before you had sex
in front of every freak

04:47.829 --> 04:48.871
on the Internet.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.206
I found these

04:50.289 --> 04:51.374
{\an3}scattered
all over town.

04:54.293 --> 04:55.211
{\an1}Well, after last
week's screen debut,

04:55.294 --> 04:56.379
I'm sure a lot of people are

04:56.462 --> 04:57.755
asking themselves
the same thing.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.049
You're being a real jerk
right now, Steve.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.926
Thanks.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.195
The place looks great.

05:21.279 --> 05:23.114
Done a lot of work.

05:24.490 --> 05:25.742
Last load from the car.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.452
Great, um,
just put it anywhere.

05:27.535 --> 05:30.038
{\an1}Yeah.
We had a lot of help.

05:30.121 --> 05:31.914
Hey.
Hey.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.041
Need anything else?

05:33.124 --> 05:34.208
No thanks.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.960
You sure?

05:36.044 --> 05:37.628
She said no.

05:37.712 --> 05:40.590
Started the court-appointed
classes yet?

05:40.673 --> 05:42.216
The AA meetings...

05:42.300 --> 05:43.593
Next week.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.512
Look, I know it's hard.
You have no idea.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.099
{\an3}If you need
anything else,

05:50.183 --> 05:52.185
I'm upstairs.
Thanks.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.150
Look, I'm glad somebody's
helping you out.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.194
I'm just sorry it's not me.

06:03.029 --> 06:07.408
We're, uh, putting the sign up
tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.951
I'd really like it
if you were here.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.162
Done.

06:11.245 --> 06:13.289
I've missed you.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.168
Can we do something tonight?

06:17.251 --> 06:19.629
I'd like that.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.798
But it just seems that every
time I reach out to you...

06:21.881 --> 06:24.092
I know; I always run.

06:24.175 --> 06:25.134
I won't.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.470
It just hurts.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.222
I'm not going to run.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.681
Not tonight.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.058
{\an3}I promise.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.275
{\an5}KELLY:
<i>Leah, if he was abusing you,</i>
<i>why did you go back to him?</i>

06:41.359 --> 06:43.152
I found out that
I was pregnant.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.904
You must've freaked.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.989
I was done with Lenny.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.866
Thanks to you, I'd moved on.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.993
Then you felt like you
had to go back.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.995
{\an3}For a while,
everything was great.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.164
Lenny was sweet and kind.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.999
And Allison...

06:57.083 --> 06:59.168
She's so perfect.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.547
But about a month ago,

07:02.630 --> 07:05.466
Lenny and I got into a fight
about late-night feedings,

07:05.550 --> 07:06.634
changing-- our typical stuff.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.302
Except that he hit you.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.179
And when I told him
that I wanted

07:10.263 --> 07:11.639
sole custody and the divorce...

07:11.722 --> 07:12.890
Which I am sure you'll get.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.684
{\an3}He said that if
I take his baby girl

07:14.767 --> 07:17.019
away from him,

07:17.103 --> 07:18.896
that he'll kill me.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.695
{\an6}You think we
should still have
the anniversary party?

07:25.778 --> 07:27.155
Absolutely, we have
a lot to celebrate.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.198
{\an1}No one thought
we'd make it a year.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.659
{\an6}Yeah, and with you gone,
they'll know we're not
going to make it two.

07:31.742 --> 07:34.162
Oh, come on,
you'll do just fine without me.

07:34.245 --> 07:35.663
Out of sight, out of mind.

07:35.746 --> 07:36.831
Well, I'm honored.

07:36.914 --> 07:39.667
It's not every day this joint
is visited by a reporter

07:39.750 --> 07:42.044
from the Washington bureau
of the <i> New York Chronicle.</i>

07:42.128 --> 07:44.714
Do you realize I'm going to be
3,000 miles away

07:44.797 --> 07:45.840
from the nearest mega burger?

07:45.923 --> 07:48.885
My arteries are going to thank
me until the day I die.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.553
{\an6}Hopefully,
not from a heart attack.
Yeah, suffering in a fancy

07:50.636 --> 07:52.013
hotel room,
ordering room service.

07:52.096 --> 07:52.930
The pain.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.599
They're just putting me up
for two weeks,

07:54.682 --> 07:55.892
just till I find a place.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.602
{\an4}NAT:
You better make
sure he gives you

07:57.685 --> 07:59.562
the same deal while you look.

08:03.107 --> 08:05.109
(chuckling)
Am I looking?

08:05.193 --> 08:08.905
I called my parents
and they want to sell the house.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.907
Yeah, well, sure.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.075
{\an3}It's their house.
I feel badly.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.243
With you moving,
it's only natural.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.244
I'll call them again.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.871
{\an3}Well, I was
thinking about

08:16.954 --> 08:18.748
{\an3}moving out anyway.
You were?

08:18.831 --> 08:20.208
Yeah, so there's not
a problem or anything.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.419
Hm. Does she know?

08:23.502 --> 08:24.754
{\an1}Oh, yeah.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.422
{\an3}Yeah, yeah--
she was, uh...

08:26.505 --> 08:28.424
She was real busted up.

08:28.507 --> 08:30.593
{\an3}She tell you
about the store?

08:30.676 --> 08:32.094
And a guy named Matt.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.096
{\an3}Anything else I should know?
No.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.765
Other than you don't have

08:35.847 --> 08:37.225
the market cornered
on moving on.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.111
{\an1}You haven't
returned my calls.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.279
I have nothing to say.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.114
Look, I talked to a lawyer.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.449
{\an1}He says I have nothing
to worry about.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.742
Then why do you
look so nervous?

08:54.825 --> 08:56.077
What are you going to do?

08:56.160 --> 08:57.453
I'm going to think.

08:57.536 --> 08:58.538
Just think?

09:02.583 --> 09:04.418
You kill your father.
He was abusing me.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.963
You sleep with my husband.
I know that was stupid.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.131
{\an3}You put me in a position that
no mother should be put in,

09:09.215 --> 09:10.591
that of deciding your fate.

09:10.675 --> 09:11.968
{\an3}You're damn right
I'm going to think.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.970
{\an1}You're going to turn me in,
aren't you?

09:14.053 --> 09:15.846
{\an5}I don't know.
Of course you're
going to turn me in.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.139
I told you, I don't know.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.766
{\an1}You say that,
but I know it's true.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.017
Don't press me for
an answer, Valerie.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.727
{\an3}You may not like
what you hear.

09:31.362 --> 09:32.488
Hey.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.448
Hey. Come on in.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.660
Well, what do you think?

09:37.743 --> 09:39.829
I'm impressed.

09:39.912 --> 09:43.624
{\an1}Surprised,
maybe a little confused.

09:43.708 --> 09:44.542
But impressed.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.836
Well, I figure if it fails...

09:46.919 --> 09:48.296
It won't.

09:48.379 --> 09:49.463
Nothing you work on ever does.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.632
Almost nothing.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.467
I'm sorry, I...

09:53.551 --> 09:55.303
I was only gone a week.

09:55.386 --> 09:58.514
Brandon, this isn't about you.
I know.

09:58.597 --> 10:01.851
{\an1}You've made big choices--
without me.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.561
Kind of feels weird.

10:03.644 --> 10:05.688
I don't remember being consulted

10:05.771 --> 10:06.981
about the Washington bureau

10:07.064 --> 10:09.066
of the <i> New York</i>
<i>Chronicle</i> offe.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.529
{\an1}Maybe I should
go out and come back in.

10:13.612 --> 10:15.531
We can start this over.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.241
I understand you've been
talking to my wife.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.035
Leah and I are friends, yes.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.870
Well, the last time you got
friendly with her,

10:20.953 --> 10:22.371
Leah moved out on me.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.664
Please leave.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.166
You stay away from her.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.377
I think the lady
asked you to leave.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.883
You stay away.

10:38.095 --> 10:40.222
{\an1}What was that about?
It's nothing.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.100
Kel, a crazy guy
just came in your store...

10:43.184 --> 10:44.518
Brandon, I don't need
your help, okay?

10:44.602 --> 10:46.395
{\an3}And...

10:46.479 --> 10:48.022
I don't want to start over.

10:48.105 --> 10:49.649
I didn't mean like that.
I just meant that,

10:49.732 --> 10:51.734
you know, maybe I should
go out and come back and...

10:51.817 --> 10:54.236
This is what you wanted,
the changes.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.530
All I'm saying
is that it feels odd.

10:56.614 --> 10:57.490
Well, it's what you wanted.

10:57.573 --> 11:01.118
{\an3}If it feels odd to you,
keep it to yourself.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.835
Hey.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.087
Got your call.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.214
I'm here.
What do you want?

11:13.297 --> 11:15.508
{\an3}Same thing
as everyone else.

11:18.219 --> 11:21.931
{\an3}Answer to the question,
"Where's Sophie?"

11:22.014 --> 11:24.016
Around.

11:25.684 --> 11:27.436
I worry about you.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.605
So don't worry.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.359
I have
a commercial audition tomorrow.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.486
Really? Off the flyer?

11:35.569 --> 11:37.071
Casting agent said
it got her attention.

11:37.154 --> 11:38.572
(laughs)

11:38.656 --> 11:40.408
Well, you have a way
of doing that to people.

11:43.577 --> 11:46.122
Pretty slick, huh?

11:46.205 --> 11:48.833
{\an1}Friend of mine from home
took the picture.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.836
{\an3}Yeah, Janet said she's
seen them all over town.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.589
Will you come with me
to my audition?

11:55.673 --> 11:57.341
{\an1}Why?
So you can say

11:57.425 --> 11:58.551
you knew me when.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.512
Oh, boy, you scare me.

12:01.595 --> 12:03.097
Boo.

12:03.180 --> 12:05.307
You know, I'm doing
just fine without you.

12:07.685 --> 12:08.811
Well, I'm not.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.828
DONNA:
<i>You shouldn't be here.</i>

12:25.911 --> 12:27.830
<i>Nothing is the same anymore.</i>

12:27.913 --> 12:30.583
You want me to be over
my father, but I'm not.

12:31.667 --> 12:34.170
I know.

12:34.253 --> 12:37.506
{\an6}You don't even try
to make me understand
what you're feeling.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.513
It's like I'm walking
on quicksand.

12:44.597 --> 12:48.058
Every single step I take,
I just sink a little deeper.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.481
You know how that feels?

12:53.564 --> 12:56.859
{\an3}No, but I can imagine
it's pretty awful.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.281
The thing is, I mean,
you can't possibly understand.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.205
Please don't go.

13:09.288 --> 13:12.416
{\an3}I know I said I wanted
you to, but I don't.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.210
Look, I'll call you later.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.134
No, you won't.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.605
But it is a fact that Lenny
hit Leah at least once?

13:34.688 --> 13:36.899
{\an3}I told you, I don't
discuss pending cases.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.567
{\an3}Besides, I thought
your article was about

13:38.651 --> 13:40.361
custody battles in general.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.362
Well, it is.

13:41.445 --> 13:42.780
But after I talked with Kelly,

13:42.863 --> 13:43.948
I thought the

13:44.031 --> 13:46.408
Leah-Lenny case
may be a good hook.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.953
I didn't know you were
friends with Kelly.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.247
Didn't I mention that?
No.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.123
{\an6}Hmm.
Anyway, about
the article...

13:53.207 --> 13:54.083
And she didn't mention me?

13:54.166 --> 13:56.168
Uh, no.

13:56.252 --> 13:57.419
But if you have any
other questions...

13:57.503 --> 13:58.837
Nothing about a recent breakup?

14:00.506 --> 14:01.966
Is it true that you're leaving?

14:03.717 --> 14:05.761
Hi, Val.

14:05.844 --> 14:07.805
Look, this is really
not a good time for me.

14:07.888 --> 14:10.933
I mean, I have so much
going on and...

14:11.016 --> 14:12.476
What are you guys
talking about?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.937
Nothing, uh,
just an article

14:15.020 --> 14:15.813
Brandon's writing.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.231
Why don't we do
this later, all right?

14:17.314 --> 14:19.024
Sure.
Okay.

14:21.402 --> 14:23.070
{\an1}Look, Val, uh,
I was going

14:23.153 --> 14:25.990
to come next door and talk
to you about moving.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.616
Why don't you sit down?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.451
The Kelly mess and now
you're moving?

14:29.535 --> 14:31.453
You got your own life.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.206
I can't bother you with mine.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.512
{\an3}Hi.
Name.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.556
Sophie Burns.
Head shot.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.768
Professional head shot.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.770
Karen Smith,
the casting director,

14:56.854 --> 14:58.689
{\an3}personally asked me to come.
I see.

14:58.772 --> 15:00.482
So you're doing her a favor.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.026
{\an1}I'm sure she's appreciate
you putting me

15:02.109 --> 15:03.944
at the top of the list.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.077
(snickering)

15:12.161 --> 15:14.163
I'm up next.
(snickering)

15:16.749 --> 15:18.959
Poor things, like any
of them have a chance.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.837
No, what they've
got is an agent

15:21.920 --> 15:24.173
{\an1}and a resume
and an acting coach.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.967
It's a commercial,
David, for soap.

15:27.051 --> 15:29.178
The point is, is that
they're taking the classes,

15:29.261 --> 15:31.680
they're making the rounds and
they're doing the little things.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.975
Sophie Burns.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.436
Anyone can do
the little things, David.

15:37.519 --> 15:40.147
That's why they're little.

15:49.865 --> 15:50.908
{\an1}KELLY:
Yes!

15:50.991 --> 15:52.201
{\an3}DONNA (gasps):
Perfect!

15:52.284 --> 15:54.036
Ooh, that looks good.
Good job, Joe.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.913
That's good.
Very nice.

15:55.996 --> 15:57.915
Well, we did it.

15:57.998 --> 15:59.458
What-- I'm not sure of.

15:59.541 --> 16:02.044
{\an3}Why-- I'm completely
in the dark about.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.213
{\an6}It's an adventure, Donna.
People die
on adventures.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.507
They go up in small planes,
crash in the sides of mountains,

16:06.590 --> 16:07.883
get bitten by exotic insects

16:07.966 --> 16:09.677
and get grotesque
inflammations (gasps).

16:09.760 --> 16:10.719
(laughs)

16:10.803 --> 16:14.098
They also succeed
beyond their wildest dreams.

16:14.181 --> 16:16.725
Donna, I know this
is a little scary for you,

16:16.809 --> 16:17.935
but we can make this work.

16:18.018 --> 16:20.604
I hope you're right.
Look at this place.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.231
{\an3}Look what we've
already done here.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.108
And we've done it alone--
without Brandon,

16:24.191 --> 16:26.068
without Noah,

16:26.151 --> 16:27.236
just you and me.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.737
{\an3}Thanks for
bringing that up.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.906
{\an3}Noah was supposed to
be here, now he's not.

16:30.989 --> 16:32.074
Repeat after me.

16:32.157 --> 16:33.575
His loss.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.911
Yeah, I wish I believed that.

16:35.994 --> 16:38.080
I know you don't want
to hear this.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.165
But if he keeps
pushing you away,

16:40.249 --> 16:42.876
sooner or later you're going
to have to let him go.

16:44.169 --> 16:44.878
I love him.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.214
{\an1}And I know that
he loves you, too.

16:47.297 --> 16:48.966
But take it from me,

16:49.049 --> 16:50.926
sometimes that's not enough.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.617
Hey. Listen, I ordered
a couple of cakes for tomorrow.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.287
{\an5}We've been running out
for the last couple of nights.
Oh, God.

17:18.369 --> 17:20.455
I'm supposed to meet Donna--
something about a sign.

17:20.539 --> 17:21.832
Well, I'm sure
she'll understand.

17:21.915 --> 17:22.958
I mean, that's what she does.

17:23.040 --> 17:26.086
My mom calls just now
and asks if I wouldn't mind

17:26.170 --> 17:28.130
lying about how my father died.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.506
As if the whole

17:29.590 --> 17:31.300
world doesn't already know.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.136
{\an3}Well, she's ashamed.
No, no, no.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.096
It's always about presentation
with her, you know?

17:36.180 --> 17:37.139
{\an1}My mom...

17:37.222 --> 17:39.099
Carl drops her like a stone

17:39.183 --> 17:41.602
and she tells everybody
she did the dead.

17:41.685 --> 17:42.770
It's the same thing.

17:42.853 --> 17:43.937
She's just embarrassed.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.147
Why did Carl bolt?

17:45.230 --> 17:46.982
Can't say.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.317
So you can or you won't?

17:48.400 --> 17:49.735
Both.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.948
Thing of it is,

17:55.032 --> 17:56.992
Donna can't possibly understand.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.244
{\an3}She can't.
Well, she's

17:59.328 --> 18:00.954
a lucky girl.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.164
It's the worst, isn't it?

18:07.211 --> 18:08.337
Come on.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.963
Where are we going?

18:10.047 --> 18:11.632
It's a place I want you to see.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.010
Where's your keys?

18:23.435 --> 18:25.145
Now give me a big smile.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.189
Bigger.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.691
"Not wholesome," they said.

18:29.775 --> 18:30.984
"Not fresh."

18:31.068 --> 18:32.903
Would you forget about it
and concentrate?

18:32.986 --> 18:34.947
I can be "wholesome."

18:35.030 --> 18:37.241
I can sure as hell be "fresh."

18:39.243 --> 18:41.453
I'm taking head shots here,
not mug shots.

18:42.579 --> 18:43.914
Will you give me a sec?

18:46.250 --> 18:50.170
{\an1}I once did a jingle
for hemorrhoid cream.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.171
(chuckles)

18:51.255 --> 18:53.507
And this relates to me how?

18:53.590 --> 18:55.008
It could be worse.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.593
You could've gotten the job.

18:58.095 --> 19:00.180
Now, I say

19:00.264 --> 19:01.890
when you're done here,
we go celebrate

19:01.974 --> 19:04.059
your narrow escape
from mediocrity.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.561
What did you have in mind?

19:07.145 --> 19:10.232
Well... (whispering)

19:11.817 --> 19:13.902
Oh... (laughs)

19:13.986 --> 19:16.029
Okay.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.700
Really?

19:19.783 --> 19:21.743
Soon as we get home.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.538
With the pictures.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.457
I think you're blackmailing me.

19:27.541 --> 19:28.625
{\an1}Oh, I like

19:28.709 --> 19:31.378
to think of it as
offering an incentive.

19:31.461 --> 19:32.629
(switch clicks)

19:32.713 --> 19:35.132
(mellow jazz plays)

19:55.152 --> 19:56.904
Sorry. Have to reload.

19:56.987 --> 19:59.114
Have some great stuff here.

19:59.197 --> 20:00.866
By the way,

20:00.949 --> 20:02.951
{\an1}there's this great
party tomorrow.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.162
{\an1}Lot of Hollywood big shots
are going to be there.

20:05.245 --> 20:06.747
You guys should come.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.920
Okay. Ready?

20:13.003 --> 20:14.630
You have no idea.

20:14.713 --> 20:18.216
{\an3}And tomorrow, David and I
would love to go to the party.

20:28.393 --> 20:31.230
This is where my father said
I'd never amount to anything.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.029
{\an1}And in here is where
my father said,

20:39.112 --> 20:41.114
{\an1}well, I'd never
amount to anything.

20:43.241 --> 20:44.201
And in here...

20:44.284 --> 20:46.078
I think you get the picture.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.538
Can you feel the love or what?

20:48.622 --> 20:49.998
No, just the money.

20:50.082 --> 20:50.999
But ain't that
the same thing?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.501
{\an1}Depends on
your perspective.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.919
Right.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.172
From here, it all looked great.

20:57.255 --> 21:00.384
50 rooms and every room
has a bad memory.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.344
If it's so awful,
then why'd you come here?

21:02.427 --> 21:05.055
{\an5}'Cause I'm looking
for something.
What?

21:05.138 --> 21:07.516
A way to erase
all the memories.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.519
{\an3}Okay. Then to forgetting
the past.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.020
No, that's too wimpy.

21:12.104 --> 21:12.980
To suicide.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.982
The most hostile thing
a human being can do.

21:15.065 --> 21:17.150
After murder.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.153
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

21:20.237 --> 21:23.031
Then take my word for it.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.908
You could, couldn't you?

21:24.992 --> 21:26.660
What makes you think I haven't?

21:30.247 --> 21:32.040
(laughs)

21:32.124 --> 21:33.208
You almost got me.

21:33.291 --> 21:34.209
That's good.

21:34.292 --> 21:35.877
{\an1}"What makes you
think I haven't?"

21:35.961 --> 21:37.170
{\an1}(snickers)

21:37.254 --> 21:40.549
You're a piece of work,
Val, you know that?

21:40.632 --> 21:42.342
You really are.

21:46.263 --> 21:47.305
Hey.
Hey.

21:47.389 --> 21:48.390
I'm already late, Brandon.

21:48.473 --> 21:49.891
{\an1}Yeah, yeah,
the store opening, I know.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.268
{\an1}Thanks for coming.
You're welcome.

21:51.351 --> 21:52.769
You said you wanted to talk.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.271
{\an3}But if this is about us,
I really don't...

21:54.354 --> 21:55.856
{\an1}No, no, no, no, no--
come on, sit down.

21:55.939 --> 21:57.566
{\an1}It's about a story.
Sit down.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.067
A story?

21:59.151 --> 22:01.111
Yeah, I, uh...

22:01.194 --> 22:03.739
I met Matt today.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.073
{\an1}Seems like
a nice enough guy.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.908
It's too bad I'm going
to have to trash him.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.410
What are you talking about?

22:08.493 --> 22:11.246
I'm doing a story
on outrageous custody battles

22:11.329 --> 22:12.622
like Lenny and Leah's.

22:12.706 --> 22:13.749
(laughs)

22:13.832 --> 22:16.043
{\an1}The fact that that animal
thinks he deserves custody...

22:16.126 --> 22:17.210
Brandon, why are you
doing this?

22:17.294 --> 22:19.087
It's a good story.

22:19.171 --> 22:19.921
There are others.

22:20.005 --> 22:22.299
{\an1}Did I mention how good
you look today?

22:22.382 --> 22:24.134
Brandon, I don't need your help.

22:24.217 --> 22:25.427
I know.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.137
Okay, just stop.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.597
Just stop with the helping.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.058
Stop with the compliments;
just stop.

22:31.141 --> 22:32.768
I'm going to do this story, Kel.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.102
{\an3}Do you want to help?
No.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.104
I don't.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.065
You know,
this isn't easy for me.

22:39.566 --> 22:41.109
{\an3}I know.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.195
But that doesn't give you
the right to make it hard on me.

22:51.578 --> 22:53.330
{\an1}STEVE: Oh, yeah.
That's really great.

22:54.998 --> 22:57.250
The amazing thing is how quickly
you got it all together.

22:57.334 --> 22:59.669
Oh, at this rate, you'll be
franchised in a year, Donna.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.421
{\an4}Or unemployed.
(whimpers)
Come on.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.590
{\an3}Any sales yet or
do we get the honor

23:03.673 --> 23:04.841
of being the first one?

23:04.925 --> 23:06.760
Whoo-hoo!
Step right up, yeah.

23:06.843 --> 23:09.262
{\an1}(laughing)

23:11.389 --> 23:13.183
{\an1}Well, I'm glad
David found you.

23:13.266 --> 23:14.309
He was worried about you.

23:14.392 --> 23:16.103
You weren't?

23:16.186 --> 23:17.979
You can handle yourself.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.315
You sound like
that's a bad thing.

23:20.398 --> 23:22.526
No, it's just cold.

23:24.611 --> 23:25.821
{\an3}KELLY:
Oh, thank you.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.989
All right, come back.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.783
I talked to Lenny today.

23:29.866 --> 23:31.993
{\an1}Told him never
to come in here.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.079
{\an3}Good. Now, fire him
as your client

23:34.162 --> 23:35.539
{\an3}and you'll be
onto something.

23:35.622 --> 23:37.999
{\an1}I'm trying to say
I'm sorry here.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.793
Yeah, I know.

23:39.876 --> 23:41.002
{\an3}Excuse me.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.504
Okay, everybody.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.381
If you'll all
gather around.

23:44.464 --> 23:45.799
Donna?

23:45.882 --> 23:47.884
We wanted to
thank you all

23:47.968 --> 23:48.885
for coming tonight.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.429
{\an1}And encourage you
to go ahead, spend your money.

23:51.513 --> 23:52.639
Or spread the word.

23:52.722 --> 23:53.723
Or, preferably, both.

23:53.807 --> 23:55.851
(applause)

24:00.814 --> 24:02.941
(indistinct chatter,
instrumental music playing)

24:11.950 --> 24:13.535
How are you doing?

24:18.832 --> 24:21.585
So I'm the new guy, right?

24:21.668 --> 24:24.212
Fresh off the bus
from Hicksville.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.381
{\an1}And it's the first
day of school.

24:26.464 --> 24:28.633
And I keep telling myself,

24:28.717 --> 24:31.219
"Be cool. Just be cool."

24:31.303 --> 24:33.847
So what happens?

24:33.930 --> 24:36.099
I enter the main hall...

24:36.183 --> 24:37.976
right before class,

24:38.059 --> 24:39.769
so everybody's there.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.229
And I trip.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.398
{\an1}(laughs)
Total swan dive.

24:43.481 --> 24:44.608
Books go flying.

24:44.691 --> 24:46.401
I cut my chin.

24:46.484 --> 24:49.905
People are standing up,
holding up pieces of paper--

24:49.988 --> 24:52.574
6.9's across the board,
thank you very much.

24:52.657 --> 24:53.742
I remember.

24:53.825 --> 24:56.786
And just when I'm about
to put my tail between my legs,

24:56.870 --> 24:59.039
run back home to beg
Jim and Cindy

24:59.122 --> 25:02.375
to put me on the next bus
back to Minneapolis,

25:02.459 --> 25:04.878
Donna comes over to me.

25:04.961 --> 25:06.922
Introduces herself.

25:07.005 --> 25:10.342
{\an1}And thanks me for putting
everyone at ease.

25:10.425 --> 25:12.928
And then,
for the rest of the day,

25:13.011 --> 25:15.096
she takes me around
and introduces me

25:15.180 --> 25:17.891
{\an4}to everyone
as Greg Louganis.
Greg Louganis.

25:17.974 --> 25:20.101
Oh, man, Brandon,
I remember that.

25:20.185 --> 25:23.104
Boy, did she ever
save your butt, though.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.565
Actually, it was
a save by committee.

25:25.649 --> 25:28.068
Dylan, Kelly,

25:28.151 --> 25:29.653
and surprisingly, even you.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.073
Made me feel right at home.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.283
I have some leads

25:35.367 --> 25:36.952
on a place to live.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.286
Apartments mainly.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.956
Not in Beverly Hills,
but still good.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.958
Think you'll ever leave?

25:43.041 --> 25:44.626
Maybe.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.211
But I doubt it.

25:49.214 --> 25:52.133
It's pretty good
they have their own shop.

25:52.217 --> 25:55.011
They got theirs
and we got ours.

25:55.095 --> 25:57.138
We <i> had.</i>

25:58.181 --> 25:59.516
We still do.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.519
I'm staying.

26:02.602 --> 26:04.145
You're turning down

26:04.229 --> 26:06.606
{\an3}the Washington bureau
of the <i> New York Chronicle?</i>

26:06.690 --> 26:09.776
Like that isn't exactly
what you want me to do.

26:09.859 --> 26:11.236
Bran, sure I do, but...

26:12.237 --> 26:13.655
Why would you?

26:15.699 --> 26:16.992
This is home.

26:20.537 --> 26:21.997
Want to tell the troops?

26:22.080 --> 26:24.165
No, you do it.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.084
I want to stay out here
for a while.

26:31.631 --> 26:34.926
Hey, uh, Brandon told me
he's going to stick around.

26:46.313 --> 26:49.065
(indistinct chatter,
piano plays mellow jazz)

26:54.487 --> 26:57.157
{\an1}That girl, she was
handpicked by Scorsese.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.535
And that guy?

27:00.618 --> 27:02.704
Gus Van Sant's next film.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.041
{\an1}Hey, you want to meet
a director friend of mine?

27:06.124 --> 27:08.335
{\an1}Guy loves discovering
new talent.

27:08.418 --> 27:10.170
Oh, let me think, Eric.

27:10.253 --> 27:12.213
Poor and unknown,
rich and famous...

27:12.297 --> 27:14.049
{\an3}I think we
could say hello.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.550
Come on.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.430
{\an1}Ah, I haven't seen
Barney's latest.

27:20.513 --> 27:23.224
You must play
the stallion.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.559
{\an3}Excuse me?

27:24.642 --> 27:27.979
Well, rumor has it you did
14 love scenes

27:28.063 --> 27:30.065
in one day.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.150
{\an1}Bravo.

27:33.735 --> 27:36.112
Exactly what kind of movies
does Barney do?

27:36.196 --> 27:38.114
Oh, you mean you weren't in it.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.575
Let me guess.

27:40.658 --> 27:43.411
{\an3}Barney does
porno flicks.

27:43.495 --> 27:46.790
Barney's not a big believer
in the written word.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.251
I didn't think so.

27:50.335 --> 27:51.878
He's exaggerating.

27:51.961 --> 27:53.088
No, I'm telling you.

27:53.171 --> 27:54.756
She's a softer Courtney Love.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.216
A more accessible Madonna.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.552
{\an3}If you're half
what he describes,

27:59.636 --> 28:02.097
{\an3}I think you'd be just
what we're looking for.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.056
No kidding?

28:03.139 --> 28:04.766
{\an1}I mean,
you're serious?

28:04.849 --> 28:06.101
{\an1}I'm so sorry.
We've got to go.

28:06.184 --> 28:07.185
{\an1}No, we don't.
Yes, we do.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.106
David, I wasn't finished.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.190
You see the lady over there?

28:12.273 --> 28:14.818
She played the naked dead
girl in a Scorsese flick.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.111
And that guy right there

28:16.194 --> 28:17.987
{\an1}is Brad Pitt's body double
for sex scenes.

28:18.071 --> 28:20.907
{\an1}And your director pal,
let me tell you--

28:20.990 --> 28:23.118
{\an1}his list
of credits include

28:23.201 --> 28:24.994
<i>Playpen's Hot Tub Nights,</i>

28:25.078 --> 28:27.122
{\an1}volumes one
through four.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.126
Everybody has to
start somewhere?

28:31.209 --> 28:33.294
You're not starting here.

28:36.339 --> 28:38.716
I don't see what
that's got to do with custody.

28:38.800 --> 28:41.803
{\an3}I don't either, but
Lenny's arguing it does.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.972
Lenny and his lawyer.

28:44.055 --> 28:45.348
Did you have an affair?

28:45.432 --> 28:47.809
Once. A couple years ago.

28:47.892 --> 28:50.270
{\an3}My husband was beating me.
And what about

28:50.353 --> 28:52.021
{\an1}the substance abuse?
Never.

28:52.105 --> 28:53.690
That's a complete lie.

28:53.773 --> 28:55.650
Brandon,
Leah is the victim here.

28:55.733 --> 28:57.819
I know and I'm going
to show that.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.321
Thanks for coming in.

29:00.405 --> 29:01.823
Thanks for doing this.

29:01.906 --> 29:03.158
{\an3}You got it.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.285
{\an1}Leah, I'll...
I'll meet you outside.

29:09.330 --> 29:11.833
I really appreciate this, too.

29:11.916 --> 29:13.501
You weren't so sure yesterday.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.296
{\an1}That's because it
still hurts, Brandon.

29:16.379 --> 29:17.297
I'm staying, you know.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.215
I know, but I don't know why.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.301
Why is it so hard
for everyone to believe

29:21.384 --> 29:22.844
that what I want is right here?

29:22.927 --> 29:25.722
{\an1}Because it's not
and we both know that.

29:25.805 --> 29:27.182
{\an3}You want everything
to move forward,

29:27.265 --> 29:28.391
I want everything to stop.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.101
Brandon, take the job.

29:30.185 --> 29:31.603
{\an1}If you don't,
you're going to regret it.

29:33.104 --> 29:35.023
Look, Leah's waiting
and I got a lot of work to do.

29:35.106 --> 29:37.192
What are you so scared of?

29:37.275 --> 29:39.486
I really have
a lot of work to do.

29:49.329 --> 29:51.206
Eh, it's nice.

29:51.289 --> 29:52.874
This one's my favorite.

29:52.957 --> 29:54.751
I look too wholesome.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.670
{\an3}Fine, send the casting
director sultry.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.756
I like wholesome.

30:01.132 --> 30:03.301
{\an1}Director left a message
at my service.

30:03.384 --> 30:05.386
I'm sure he did.

30:06.513 --> 30:08.765
{\an1}I'm thinking
of calling him back.

30:10.808 --> 30:12.435
You can do better.

30:12.519 --> 30:14.854
{\an1}So you keep telling me.
Well, it's the truth.

30:14.938 --> 30:18.399
Look, I think you're right
and I appreciate your support,

30:18.483 --> 30:19.400
but I need to work.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.694
I know.
And you will.

30:21.778 --> 30:23.238
No, I need to work now.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.241
My check that I wrote
for these head shots,

30:26.324 --> 30:27.951
it's going to bounce.

30:28.034 --> 30:30.620
My school loan, as soon
as I fail the midterms

30:30.703 --> 30:32.413
for the classes I haven't
been going to in weeks,

30:32.497 --> 30:34.207
that's history, too.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.543
As soon as they find out
I'm not a student anymore,

30:36.626 --> 30:37.710
the government
will come collecting.

30:37.794 --> 30:39.629
{\an3}You can do better
than a porno flick.

30:39.712 --> 30:41.923
If you just wait,
you'll get your chance.

30:42.006 --> 30:44.133
I was supposed to already
have had it by now.

30:44.217 --> 30:45.593
You've only been here
four weeks.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.053
{\an3}Most people...
I'm not most people.

30:47.136 --> 30:48.263
{\an1}Okay?

30:48.346 --> 30:49.722
I'm not going home a failure.

30:49.806 --> 30:51.432
{\an1}I'm just not.
How well you do out here

30:51.516 --> 30:52.725
has nothing to do
with whether

30:52.809 --> 30:54.310
{\an3}you're a failure or not.
Whatever.

30:55.353 --> 30:56.437
I hate this picture.

31:03.069 --> 31:05.238
(knocking on door)

31:06.656 --> 31:07.991
Hello?
Let's go.

31:08.074 --> 31:09.909
But, Brandon...
No "buts," let's go.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.160
Come on.

31:16.082 --> 31:17.625
What are we doing?

31:17.709 --> 31:19.460
What I'm afraid of.

31:19.544 --> 31:21.462
{\an3}Night swimming.
I've lived here nine years.

31:21.546 --> 31:24.007
{\an6}I've never done it.
Have you?
No.

31:24.090 --> 31:26.342
Brandon, you're crazy.
Completely.

31:27.343 --> 31:29.637
My God...

31:29.721 --> 31:31.264
(screams)

31:31.347 --> 31:32.473
(whoops)

31:32.557 --> 31:34.183
Brandon, wait for me!

31:37.103 --> 31:39.147
(keypad beeping)

31:44.944 --> 31:46.279
Hey.

31:46.362 --> 31:48.156
{\an1}Good day?

31:48.239 --> 31:49.324
A few sales.

31:49.407 --> 31:50.992
Walk you to your car?

31:51.075 --> 31:53.119
I'm fine.
Are you?

31:58.124 --> 32:00.960
{\an3}Look, Matt, I was in
an abusive relationship.

32:01.044 --> 32:02.462
And I understand that you're

32:02.545 --> 32:05.048
{\an6}not endorsing what
Lenny did...
Donna, look...

32:05.131 --> 32:08.926
{\an1}My parents, they got divorced
when I was three, okay?

32:09.010 --> 32:10.678
My mother was awarded
full custody.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.013
And after that, she moved away.

32:12.096 --> 32:14.223
{\an1}I never got a chance
to see my father, ever.

32:14.307 --> 32:16.351
That's why I took on this case.

32:16.434 --> 32:17.560
It's not about

32:17.644 --> 32:19.228
{\an1}protecting Lenny,
who at best,

32:19.312 --> 32:21.397
{\an1}deserves supervised
visitation.

32:21.481 --> 32:24.400
It's about preventing his
daughter from losing her father.

32:26.444 --> 32:28.279
Thanks for explaining that.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.032
What is it? Tell me.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.409
Nothing.

32:33.493 --> 32:35.203
It's just your openness,
it's nice.

32:35.286 --> 32:36.537
Any word from Noah?

32:36.621 --> 32:38.373
No, not since yesterday.

32:38.456 --> 32:40.166
Well, if you need
someone to talk with

32:40.249 --> 32:41.042
about what you're going through.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.710
Maybe some other time.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.087
Just not right now.

32:44.170 --> 32:46.881
The, uh, offer to walk you
to your car

32:46.964 --> 32:48.216
still stands, you know.

32:48.299 --> 32:51.052
Thanks, I appreciate that.

32:51.135 --> 32:52.053
Some other time?

32:52.136 --> 32:53.638
Sure.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.183
Good night.
Night.

33:01.312 --> 33:03.439
{\an1}I swear I saw a shark
swim right by you.

33:03.523 --> 33:04.607
He almost got you.

33:04.691 --> 33:05.900
Like his dorsal fin was

33:05.983 --> 33:08.528
{\an3}just kind of brushing
up against you.

33:08.611 --> 33:11.030
{\an4}That's the creepy
thing about being
out there at night.

33:11.114 --> 33:12.949
You can't see anything.

33:15.118 --> 33:17.412
That's what scares me.

33:17.495 --> 33:19.247
The unknown.

33:19.330 --> 33:21.749
Well, for me, it's the tide.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.585
Just the idea that you
can get sucked out there

33:24.669 --> 33:26.629
and not be able to get back...

33:26.713 --> 33:28.506
And while you're out there,

33:28.589 --> 33:32.051
your footprints and every sign
that you were ever here...

33:32.135 --> 33:33.803
get washed away.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.265
That's not going to happen.

33:37.348 --> 33:40.101
I find it very overrated,

33:40.184 --> 33:43.271
all this growing up,

33:43.354 --> 33:45.273
taking responsibility,
becoming an adult.

33:45.356 --> 33:47.150
I hate to break it to you,

33:47.233 --> 33:50.194
but we are adults.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.614
We're going to have
to grow up sometime.

33:53.698 --> 33:56.576
I'm sorry.

33:56.659 --> 33:57.994
For what?

33:58.077 --> 33:59.871
For not letting you move on.

34:01.164 --> 34:03.624
For not being good enough
of a friend to do that.

34:08.254 --> 34:09.630
You up for another dip?

34:09.714 --> 34:12.091
No, I don't think so.

34:12.175 --> 34:14.092
Do you mind if I do?

34:14.177 --> 34:16.179
Say hi to Jaws for me.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.598
Hey.

34:20.266 --> 34:21.058
I'm really proud of you.

34:23.268 --> 34:24.853
Are you sure you
don't want to come?

34:26.563 --> 34:28.232
You're on your own.

34:31.068 --> 34:32.779
Yeah.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.547
{\an5}SOPHIE:
<i>Just a little bit further.</i>
<i>We're almost there.</i>

34:52.632 --> 34:53.549
DAVID:
<i>Almost where?</i>

34:53.632 --> 34:55.885
{\an1}I told you,
it's a surprise.

34:58.262 --> 35:00.807
Okay, pull over.

35:00.890 --> 35:02.517
Here.
Here?

35:02.600 --> 35:04.727
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

35:13.277 --> 35:15.071
Isn't it great?

35:17.615 --> 35:19.659
I thought you didn't have
any money.

35:19.742 --> 35:21.953
I don't.

35:22.036 --> 35:24.372
But the guy who sold me
the space doesn't know that yet.

35:24.455 --> 35:26.707
{\an1}Sophie!
What?

35:26.791 --> 35:29.210
I took your advice.
I'm not settling.

35:29.293 --> 35:30.878
If the flyer got me
a commercial audition,

35:30.962 --> 35:32.213
think what this'll get me.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.840
It's just not conventional,
that's all.

35:33.923 --> 35:36.342
Yeah, well...

35:37.927 --> 35:40.054
I'm not a conventional girl.

35:40.137 --> 35:41.973
No question about that.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.561
You're cute, the way
you worry about me.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.229
But you don't have to.

35:48.312 --> 35:49.814
I'm going to make it.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.317
I'm sure you will.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.367
Look at me, David.

36:01.450 --> 36:03.244
No, look at me.

36:15.214 --> 36:16.591
All I'm saying is maybe

36:16.674 --> 36:18.718
we shouldn't make such
a big deal out of it.

36:18.801 --> 36:20.219
{\an1}You're the one who
wanted to celebrate.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.137
{\an3}Do you know what
people get

36:21.220 --> 36:22.138
{\an3}for their first
anniversary?

36:22.221 --> 36:23.848
What?
Paper.

36:23.931 --> 36:26.100
{\an3}Paper.
Let's just get this over with.

36:26.183 --> 36:28.185
(indistinct chatter)

36:33.316 --> 36:35.276
{\an1}Whoa.

36:35.359 --> 36:37.278
{\an4}Here's your hat.
What's your hurry?
Yep.

36:37.361 --> 36:38.946
{\an1}(chuckles)
We're going to miss you.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.157
{\an1}Oh, no, you're not,
'cause I'm not going anywhere.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.783
Yes, you are.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.285
No, I'm not.
You see, you said...

36:44.368 --> 36:46.287
I said a lot of stupid things

36:46.370 --> 36:47.622
because I need you in my life.

36:47.705 --> 36:49.582
{\an3}You're my
guardian angel.

36:49.665 --> 36:51.834
And you will be
wherever you are.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.254
Got to live your life, man.

36:56.380 --> 36:58.132
{\an3}It's going to kill us
to let you go.

36:58.215 --> 37:00.301
{\an3}What you saw looking through
the window last night,

37:00.384 --> 37:02.303
it'll always be
there for you.

37:02.386 --> 37:04.138
Even as an adult.

37:04.221 --> 37:05.348
{\an1}So what
you're all saying is:

37:05.431 --> 37:06.599
{\an1}"Get the hell
out of here," right?

37:06.682 --> 37:07.975
Pretty much.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.311
Well, I guess I better go see
if I still have a job.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.189
Come on, give me a hand,
get the punch.

37:13.272 --> 37:15.107
Yes, sir.

37:20.237 --> 37:22.198
Look, I should've called.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.075
I know you're going through

37:24.158 --> 37:26.953
{\an3}a really terrible thing
right now; I do.

37:27.036 --> 37:31.332
{\an3}But I need you to give
something back--

37:31.415 --> 37:33.167
anything, something--

37:33.250 --> 37:35.336
and I need you to do it now.

37:35.419 --> 37:36.712
And if I can't?

37:38.255 --> 37:39.382
You have to.

37:40.466 --> 37:41.717
Say good-bye for me.

37:41.801 --> 37:43.427
I'm going to get out of here.

37:51.060 --> 37:53.104
Saw Brandon's article today.

37:53.187 --> 37:54.522
Thought it was very fair.

37:54.605 --> 37:55.690
{\an1}Too fair.

37:55.773 --> 37:57.191
Kelly, Lenny is the father.

37:57.274 --> 37:58.025
{\an3}You know he has a
right to protect...

37:58.109 --> 37:59.860
I'm not interested
in Lenny's rights.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.654
{\an1}I'm interested
in his child's rights,

38:01.737 --> 38:04.573
{\an1}and I'm telling you now,
you better protect that baby.

38:12.915 --> 38:14.667
Oh.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.252
Hey.

38:16.335 --> 38:18.212
Grabbing some beer.

38:18.295 --> 38:20.548
{\an1}Yeah, well, Nat told me
to do the same.

38:20.631 --> 38:22.216
I'll let you take care of it.

38:22.299 --> 38:25.678
{\an3}Steve.

38:25.761 --> 38:27.304
Yes?

38:28.973 --> 38:30.850
I should have told you
about me and Sophie.

38:33.352 --> 38:34.770
So, what is this, payback?

38:34.854 --> 38:37.315
I used to worship you.

38:37.398 --> 38:40.401
Hey, David, do you like Sophie?

38:42.278 --> 38:43.863
Not enough
to blow our friendship.

38:43.946 --> 38:45.823
Me, either.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.035
Bubby?

38:50.202 --> 38:52.038
(chuckles)

38:52.121 --> 38:53.748
You're all right, man.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.041
Sorry, man.

38:55.124 --> 38:56.625
I'm sorry, too.

38:56.709 --> 38:58.753
Let's get these beers next door.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.224
Hey.

39:12.308 --> 39:13.601
Hi.

39:13.684 --> 39:15.770
Should I sit down?

39:15.853 --> 39:17.855
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

39:25.362 --> 39:26.655
I'm not going to do it.

39:26.739 --> 39:28.282
(sighs)

39:28.365 --> 39:29.658
Thank you.

39:29.742 --> 39:31.994
I don't forgive you.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.163
And if I were a stronger person,
I'd turn you in.

39:34.246 --> 39:36.457
But it was hard enough
to deal with the shame

39:36.540 --> 39:37.666
of your father's suicide.

39:37.750 --> 39:41.087
To have everyone know what went
on between the two of you...

39:41.170 --> 39:42.755
Mother, he raped me.

39:42.838 --> 39:44.465
That would be too much.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.258
So, this is about you?

39:46.342 --> 39:47.176
Did you hear me?

39:47.259 --> 39:48.928
I'm keeping the secret.

39:49.011 --> 39:50.721
Of course you are.

39:50.805 --> 39:52.181
I mean, that's what we do.

39:52.264 --> 39:54.141
That-That's how we cope.

39:54.225 --> 39:55.810
We're that miserable.

39:55.893 --> 39:57.686
You sound like you want me
to go to the police.

39:57.770 --> 39:58.771
No, Mother.

39:58.854 --> 40:02.483
What I want is to stop feeling
dirty and afraid.

40:02.566 --> 40:05.319
I want closure.

40:05.402 --> 40:07.154
And you're not giving it to me.

40:09.698 --> 40:11.700
BRANDON:
Yeah.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.665
What's up?

40:19.416 --> 40:22.336
{\an1}I, um, called the <i> Chronicle,</i>
groveled...

40:22.419 --> 40:23.462
And?

40:23.546 --> 40:24.505
I'm a good groveler.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.340
You're good at everything.

40:26.423 --> 40:28.217
Except saying good-bye.

40:28.300 --> 40:31.178
I have no regrets.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.888
Neither do I.

40:49.822 --> 40:52.074
(keypad beeping)

40:52.158 --> 40:53.367
(line rings)

40:53.451 --> 40:55.202
NOAH:
Hi. This is Noah. I'm not home.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.412
Speak.

40:56.495 --> 40:57.538
(voicemail beeps)

40:57.621 --> 40:59.665
(phone beeps off)

41:42.666 --> 41:45.211
You okay?
Not really.

41:45.294 --> 41:48.214
{\an1}That offer to talk,
you know, it still stands.

41:48.297 --> 41:50.132
I'm glad.

41:50.216 --> 41:52.218
Come on.
Let's go grab a drink.

41:52.301 --> 41:54.178
Okay.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.142
{\an3}All right.
I talked to my parents.

42:00.226 --> 42:02.228
{\an1}Bran, you didn't have
to go talk to your parents.

42:02.311 --> 42:03.771
House is yours for as
long as you want it.

42:03.854 --> 42:05.439
But I'm glad you did.

42:05.522 --> 42:07.024
That was really nice of you.

42:07.107 --> 42:08.442
All right, I left a
message with Noah,

42:08.525 --> 42:10.444
{\an3}let him know he's got a place
to stay, if he needs it.

42:10.527 --> 42:12.279
{\an3}Everything else we can
deal with by phone.

42:12.363 --> 42:13.739
{\an3}And that leaves
pretty much nothing.

42:13.822 --> 42:15.950
{\an3}You got to score me some
stuff from the White House.

42:16.033 --> 42:17.743
Pens, papers...

42:17.826 --> 42:19.620
{\an3}You know, a paperweight
from his desk would be nice.

42:19.703 --> 42:21.038
Check's in the mail.

42:23.249 --> 42:24.250
This is really tough.

42:26.168 --> 42:27.086
Yeah.

42:27.169 --> 42:29.630
I can't believe
you're really going, Brandon.

42:29.713 --> 42:31.924
I'll take that as high praise.

42:37.346 --> 42:39.098
DAVID:
