00:52.844 --> 00:55.180
We've been out here maybe ten minutes,
Your Majesty.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.223
Wonder what this thing does?

00:58.683 --> 01:00.393
-Well, that would've been not boring...

...had the little sac of fungi exploded

Hmm?

01:08.151 --> 01:10.320
Yes! Something new and exciting,

01:10.403 --> 01:12.280
a gift from the Sky Gods!

01:52.821 --> 01:55.573
The Sky Gods clearly want me
to have eyes in the sky,

01:55.657 --> 01:57.200
so I, too, can watch my peeps.

01:57.283 --> 01:58.743

02:01.371 --> 02:03.832

they're safe and feel better about myself

02:08.002 --> 02:10.296

02:10.380 --> 02:12.715

Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

02:23.810 --> 02:25.061

03:31.586 --> 03:32.795

My peoples, the cameras will help
to prevent crime

the safest in all the land.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.013
Oh!

03:42.096 --> 03:45.058
Sounds like an invasion of privacy
if you ask me.

03:45.141 --> 03:48.519
Oh, well, speaking of felons,

03:48.603 --> 03:50.647
if anyone is caught committing a crime,

03:50.730 --> 03:53.191
they will be arrested and put behind bars.

I'm gonna enforce

09:57.221 --> 09:58.973
I broke it, like, all of the times

because you're in here.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.728

another week's worth of protection.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.183
You don't have to listen to her.

12:09.979 --> 12:13.274
What'd you say?

12:15.401 --> 12:18.612
Oh, oh, oh, so sorry. I'm sorry.
Did I, uh, stutter?

12:23.284 --> 12:25.161
-Hmph!

12:26.495 --> 12:28.539
-Fight!

12:31.167 --> 12:33.294
-Yay!

12:34.920 --> 12:37.715
Yay!

12:51.645 --> 12:52.813
Aah!

12:52.897 --> 12:55.024
Oh, the lemur's elbow.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.912
Wait a minute, Mr. Postman. For you, Zora.

13:07.995 --> 13:12.500
"To the most gorgeous Goliath

13:12.583 --> 13:16.837
with the prettiest, purplest eyes
I have ever seen.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.298
I mean, wowza."

13:19.381 --> 13:22.259
Oh, oh, oh.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.303
Oh.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.648
Aah! Who do you work for?

13:35.731 --> 13:39.193
What kind of benefits are they giving you?
Does it include dental?

13:39.777 --> 13:41.487
A lifetime supply of mangoes,

13:41.570 --> 13:45.324
and I'll even throw in a mouse lemur
that's basically indestructible.

13:45.407 --> 13:47.493
What do you sa

13:47.576 --> 13:48.827
Mo

13:48.911 --> 13:51.539
I'm sorry, Your Majesty,
but it was the only way.

13:51.622 --> 13:54.750
Was it, though? Because I'm pretty sure
there were other ways,

13:54.833 --> 13:57.795
like just asking me to come with you,
for example!

13:57.878 --> 13:59.672
Be quiet! They can hear us.

13:59.755 --> 14:00.839
Who is they?

14:00.923 --> 14:02.258
I don't know. I don't know.

14:02.341 --> 14:06.804
Hmm, buddy, I say this as a friend
coming from a place of love,

14:06.887 --> 14:10.224
but if you had a rocker,
you would definitely not be on it.

14:10.307 --> 14:13.602
Y-you'd be out like way off to the side
in the corner somewhere.

14:13.686 --> 14:18.148
<i>Maybe not even on the same porch.</i>
<i>Cuckoo crazy town.</i>

14:18.232 --> 14:19.859
Follow me.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.115
-Ah, Maurice!

14:27.867 --> 14:30.286
This is it! The neutral zone.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.081
And a trail of chocolate.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.458
What if it's ancient aliens, Your Majesty?

14:36.542 --> 14:38.961
What if it's ancient al

14:39.044 --> 14:40.921
Keep it together, Mo-Mo!

14:41.005 --> 14:43.507
<i>-I love it!</i>

14:46.677 --> 14:49.680
Oh, I love chocolate-covered mangoes.

14:49.763 --> 14:53.225
The fruit of love.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.352
-Shh, keep it down!

14:57.438 --> 15:03.444
Just because I can't rule the kingdom
doesn't mean I can't control it.

15:03.527 --> 15:04.820
<i>Yo-ho!</i>

15:13.829 --> 15:17.666
Boy, would've been pretty convenient
if he just choked to death right there.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.376
Your Majesty, we need a plan.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.296
-Oh, I've got a plan.

15:22.379 --> 15:25.549
No, Maurice! It's been, like, two seconds!

15:25.633 --> 15:27.051
Sheesh!

15:27.134 --> 15:28.886
But I'll get one.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.642
-Little Miss Popular.

15:34.725 --> 15:38.437
Someone's gentleman caller
sure is calling a lot lately.

15:38.520 --> 15:42.524
Oh, and, boy,
does he have a way with words!

15:43.859 --> 15:46.153
Ooh!

15:46.236 --> 15:47.112
Oh!

15:48.530 --> 15:51.700
Did you write letter to me, fur dumpling?

15:51.784 --> 15:54.411
Zora, you know
I never write anything down.

15:54.495 --> 15:58.040
It could be used against me in court!
I mean, come on, baby.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.834
Oh.

16:02.169 --> 16:04.254
Who sent this to Zora?

16:06.090 --> 16:07.591
Yes, Your Majesty?

16:07.675 --> 16:12.346
Ted, as much as it pains me to say this,
and it does pain me, I need your help.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.014
You do?

16:14.098 --> 16:17.518
Sadly, yes.
Do you have a sense of urgency?

16:17.601 --> 16:19.144
I do not, sir.

16:21.897 --> 16:25.109
Oh!
Hi, Zora.

16:25.192 --> 16:27.820
I'm gonna take a nap now
in your armpit pouch.

16:27.903 --> 16:32.658
Mort, sorry, but I carry water in it
like camel.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.284
It all full.

16:34.368 --> 16:38.205
Oh, that's okay. I can hold my breath.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.665
Oh, Mort.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.875
I must tell you something.

16:41.959 --> 16:45.421
Someone has been sending me love letters.

16:45.504 --> 16:49.091
Oh! My heart beat
to eternal rhythm of his word.

16:49.174 --> 16:52.970
-I long for him. Oh!

16:54.555 --> 16:57.516
It's not you, Mort. It's destiny.

16:57.599 --> 17:00.477
Oh, I'm meant to be with him.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.237
<i>Boring!</i>

17:10.320 --> 17:11.989
Hello, nephew.

17:12.072 --> 17:14.658
<i>♪ And a little zoom here</i>
<i>And a little zoom there ♪</i>

17:14.742 --> 17:16.035
<i>♪ And a zoom-zoom here ♪</i>

17:17.411 --> 17:20.414
No point in being a king
without my peoples.

17:20.497 --> 17:23.876
<i>Might as well leave my kingdom and crown.</i>

17:23.959 --> 17:25.544
<i>Bye, crown.</i>

17:25.627 --> 17:28.547
Ooh!

17:28.630 --> 17:31.425
My plan is working better
than I ever imagined.

17:33.886 --> 17:37.973
Nephew's looking a little frown-y,
and I've got the crown-y.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.769
Ooh! Mm.

17:41.852 --> 17:45.647
I got to write my purply-eyed
muscular goddess.

17:45.731 --> 17:50.402
And I got to tell her the good news.

17:50.486 --> 17:54.156
Audible gasp! That's where the letters
have been coming from?

17:54.239 --> 17:57.242
Not exactly how I pictured
Zora's secret suitor,

17:57.326 --> 17:59.870
but, oh, got to do my job!

17:59.953 --> 18:01.580
Freeze, buster!

18:01.663 --> 18:03.874
-Whoa!
-That's right, freeze!

18:05.000 --> 18:08.003
Ted, what are you doing?
You're not supposed to freeze!

18:08.087 --> 18:10.756
-Oh, my bad, Your Majesty.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.469
Come on, man!

18:15.552 --> 18:18.597
Oh! Now what are we gonna do?

18:18.680 --> 18:20.974
Oh, I don't know. Start pointing fingers.

18:21.058 --> 18:21.975
Ted!

18:22.059 --> 18:24.436
If you had just made the arrest
in the first place,

18:24.520 --> 18:26.146
we wouldn't be in this situation.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.607
Oh, my.

18:28.690 --> 18:31.151
It's the letter
your uncle was writing to Zora.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.361
Zora and Uncle say

18:32.444 --> 18:34.947
I've been reading his letters to her
for weeks.

18:35.030 --> 18:38.450
He has got it B-A-D bad for her.

18:38.534 --> 18:44.498
Ooh, Uncle may have the crown,
but we have something he wants.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.465
Enough with the tough-guy bit, Clover!

18:53.549 --> 18:55.968
We get it. Prison made you hard.

18:56.051 --> 18:59.680
I need your help enforcing the law.
You remember. Rules?

18:59.763 --> 19:02.933
I... I love rules.

19:03.016 --> 19:05.936
There she is. Here's the plan.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.064
Ooh!

19:09.148 --> 19:10.941
Oh! Oh!

19:11.024 --> 19:12.109
Wowza!

19:12.192 --> 19:15.612
You smell same scent as letters.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.533
Yes, my big girl.
I've been watching you on the monitors.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.118
I just had to write you.

19:21.201 --> 19:25.122
So strong, so masculine.
You tantalizing titan.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.832
-Whoa!

19:28.834 --> 19:30.836
Uh... yeah.

19:30.919 --> 19:33.630
-Got ya, Uncle!
-This is not what it looks like!

19:33.714 --> 19:38.218
Oh, really? So you're--you're not trying
to take over my kingdom

19:38.302 --> 19:42.931
and...  and make Zora your queen?

19:43.015 --> 19:45.684
Queen!
Sure.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.645
I started the whole thing
wanting to take over the kingdom,

19:48.729 --> 19:51.231
<i>and I knew by sending you</i>
<i>the surveillance gear</i>

19:51.315 --> 19:53.400
<i>that would help me, you know,</i>
<i>do just that.</i>

19:53.483 --> 19:56.028
<i>But then something magical</i>
<i>happened, Julien.</i>

19:56.111 --> 20:00.616
I saw this beautiful behemoth,
and none of that mattered anymore.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.367
It was a complete game changer.

20:02.451 --> 20:03.994
-Just look at her.

20:04.077 --> 20:07.039
You see, I've wasted so many seasons
chasing the crown

20:07.122 --> 20:10.959
that what I've been missing
this whole time was something else...

20:11.043 --> 20:12.628
true love.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.844
-I think I'm gonna be sick.
-I love it!

20:20.928 --> 20:25.224
Oh! Your words move me
more than Mouse Lemur Mort.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.184
Freeze! Secured!

20:27.267 --> 20:29.186
Uh, yeah, secured.

20:30.687 --> 20:32.231
I only wanted the crown

20:32.314 --> 20:35.692
so that I could grant Zora a royal pardon
to free her.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.861
And then we could run away together.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.697
Here, take this silly thing.
I don't want it anymore.

20:40.781 --> 20:44.952
-Uncle, you have broken the law big-time.

20:45.035 --> 20:48.580
Huge! Colossal!
You should be thrown into jail.

20:48.664 --> 20:51.959
-Yes!
-But I'm not going to arrest you today.

20:53.794 --> 20:58.674
Nope. In fact, I'm going to pardon
you and Zora.

20:58.757 --> 21:02.135
I know we've had our ups and downs
over the years.

21:02.219 --> 21:05.264
Tried to off each other
a time or two or seven.

21:05.347 --> 21:08.100
But at the end of the day, we are family.

21:08.183 --> 21:10.602
So run along, you crazy lovebirds!

21:10.686 --> 21:12.938
-Start a life together!
-Aah!

21:13.730 --> 21:17.067
-Anywhere but here.
-Thank you, Mr. King Julien!

21:17.150 --> 21:19.903
I-I don't know what to say. I'm touched.

21:19.987 --> 21:22.656
I am so glad
that I wasn't able to kill you.

21:22.739 --> 21:27.077
Seeing real emotions coming out of you
is very unsettling, Uncle.

21:27.995 --> 21:32.541
You, missy, are under arrest
for stealing my heart.

21:34.501 --> 21:37.129
-Later, haters!

21:38.297 --> 21:42.050
You really think you can trust your uncle
after all the stuff he's pulled?

21:42.134 --> 21:44.761
Probably not, but I can't think
of a better punishment

21:44.845 --> 21:48.181
than Zora's unrelenting... love.

21:48.265 --> 21:51.101
Now let's go shut down that prison
and get my kingdom back.

21:51.977 --> 21:56.273
Willie, Hector, Tammy, Pancho.

21:56.356 --> 21:58.150
Not me, I'm staying.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.902
I've been institutionalized.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.780
Okay, then.
That's everyone. Except Mort.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.199
What do you mean he isn't here?

22:06.283 --> 22:08.618
A lemur can't just disappear
from his cell!

22:11.288 --> 22:13.123
Uh...

22:21.381 --> 22:24.134
Zora!

22:35.687 --> 22:38.356
Hmm. Phew. Dodged that bullet.
