14:54.388 --> 14:56.068
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

14:57.908 --> 15:00.868
Excuse me. Hey. Hello.

15:09.390 --> 15:11.590
(WHISPERING) Yeah, I know. Me too.

15:24.912 --> 15:26.552
This should be interesting.

15:26.632 --> 15:28.432
- Please, Aggie.
- Bradley.

15:28.512 --> 15:30.953
I only need you to keep him till Friday,
Kathryn's birthday.

15:31.033 --> 15:33.993
- Kathryn is scared of dogs.
- Not anymore.

15:34.073 --> 15:35.673
- I took her to the pound.
- But...

15:35.753 --> 15:37.713
Besides, isn't that
what relationships are all about?

15:37.793 --> 15:39.394
Overcoming your deepest fears?

15:39.474 --> 15:42.954
- His name is Bradley Jr.
- Did you think of that one all by yourself?

15:43.034 --> 15:44.234
No, smartass.

15:44.274 --> 15:46.635
Billy, your Uncle Bradley's here!
He brought along a friend.

15:46.675 --> 15:50.035
- I'm gonna miss you. Here you go.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

15:51.715 --> 15:53.596
- Only until Friday.
- Yeah.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.196
He likes you.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.201
Well, would you look at that?

16:23.801 --> 16:27.281
They have completely moved out,
hammock and everything.

16:27.801 --> 16:30.162
You never heard such screaming.

16:30.202 --> 16:32.202
The movers told them to shut the hell up

16:32.282 --> 16:35.242
or they'd throw
all their things in the street.

16:38.803 --> 16:40.963
Remember when they first moved in here?

16:41.043 --> 16:42.963
I said I'd never seen a happier couple.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.523
What did I tell you?

16:44.924 --> 16:47.844
It's the house. It's cursed.

16:49.244 --> 16:52.325
Houses aren't cursed, now. People are.

17:04.445 --> 17:06.205
You're a jock, huh?

17:06.286 --> 17:07.567
I used to be.

17:08.047 --> 17:09.887
That was a long time ago.

17:11.327 --> 17:14.647
That's my mom.
She took off when I was in junior high.

17:15.808 --> 17:17.728
Bat drove her away.

17:17.808 --> 17:20.887
- Bat?
- My dad. His name's Bathold.

17:21.489 --> 17:25.049
People call him the Bat, so that ought
to tell you something, right?

17:26.249 --> 17:28.290
Yeah, he blows up tree stumps for a living.

17:28.369 --> 17:31.171
Then he comes home,
thinks about my mom,

17:31.251 --> 17:33.011
and gets shitfaced.

17:41.932 --> 17:43.132
Yours?

17:43.212 --> 17:44.253
Yeah.

17:44.293 --> 17:47.133
My mom gave it to me when I was a kid.

17:47.573 --> 17:49.613
Do you sleep with him?

17:50.013 --> 17:54.694
Yeah. What? Is that bad?
He's a great little spoon.

17:56.894 --> 18:00.695
Ex-jock druggie
who still has a teddy bear?

18:01.415 --> 18:03.055
Nothing hotter than that.

18:03.975 --> 18:06.496
And what makes you think I'm a druggie?

18:07.016 --> 18:09.656
Pisces, Virgo rising.

18:10.456 --> 18:12.976
What was it? Coke?

18:15.697 --> 18:16.657
E?

18:18.457 --> 18:19.737
Heroin?

18:20.177 --> 18:21.698
Sure, why not?

18:25.098 --> 18:27.258
So, why'd you quit?

18:27.819 --> 18:29.699
What makes you think I quit?

18:32.299 --> 18:36.420
Oh, right. Pisces, Virgo rising.

18:36.940 --> 18:38.220
Very good.

18:42.541 --> 18:46.701
I had this dream one night
while I was wasted.

18:46.781 --> 18:52.502
There was this African monkey
whispering all this creepy shit in my ear.

18:53.582 --> 18:57.983
He said that if I didn't get clean
I was gonna die young,

18:59.064 --> 19:02.624
OD in an alleyway on a pile of garbage.

19:06.505 --> 19:12.306
And that morning I woke up
and I went to my first meeting.

19:14.546 --> 19:18.426
It was seven months and two weeks ago.

19:20.187 --> 19:25.067
I can prove it. I got my six-month chip.

19:31.508 --> 19:32.948
Cool.

19:33.428 --> 19:35.109
It doesn't scare you?

19:37.429 --> 19:41.389
Most junkies, you know,
even if they never use again,

19:43.470 --> 19:45.910
it doesn't matter. It's too late.

19:47.510 --> 19:50.991
They're just gone,
you know, permanent zombies.

19:51.631 --> 19:55.471
But then there's junkies where
all the horrible places they've been,

19:56.872 --> 19:58.992
all the horrible shit they've done,

20:00.152 --> 20:02.952
the fact that they come back from it

20:03.592 --> 20:07.673
makes them better people
than if they'd never used in the first place.

20:11.474 --> 20:12.754
That's you.

20:35.838 --> 20:37.758
Hey, where's the little girl's room?

20:37.958 --> 20:39.158
Across the hall.

20:39.198 --> 20:40.358
Okay.

20:47.119 --> 20:48.080

20:48.880 --> 20:49.960
Oh, shit!

20:51.040 --> 20:53.760
Oscar! Goddamn it!
You get that girl out of your room, Oscar!

20:53.840 --> 20:54.840
Get the fuck away!

20:54.880 --> 20:56.481
BAT: You do it right now, damn it!
Do you hear me?

20:56.561 --> 20:58.521
I should have warned you.
I didn't think he'd be back this early.

20:58.601 --> 21:00.441
BAT: Oscar! I ain't running
a motel around here!

21:00.481 --> 21:02.161
- You hear me?
- Yeah, I heard you!

21:02.241 --> 21:04.922
- Maybe we should just go out the window.
- No!

21:04.962 --> 21:06.842
We're going out the way we came in.

21:06.882 --> 21:08.602
- BAT: Oscar.
- You ready?

21:22.324 --> 21:23.484
Hello, missy.

21:23.564 --> 21:25.365
Pleased to meet you. The name's Chloe.

21:25.445 --> 21:28.205
Yeah, well, don't you come in this house
again unless I invite you.

21:28.285 --> 21:30.525
There'll be trouble
I can't be responsible for.

21:31.405 --> 21:32.846
BAT: You hear me?

21:38.406 --> 21:40.127
Hey, don't be scared, all right?

21:40.167 --> 21:43.767
He is a mean son of a bitch,
but I can be, too.

21:46.567 --> 21:48.808
I'll protect you from anything.

22:00.170 --> 22:02.131
Bradley, we have to talk.

22:02.411 --> 22:03.731
No, hold on.

22:12.892 --> 22:14.692
That's really sweet.

22:19.613 --> 22:21.613
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

22:24.614 --> 22:26.054
It's a dog.

22:27.854 --> 22:31.575
No. No, no. That's not... It's the dog.

22:31.655 --> 22:34.415
That's Bradley Jr.
That's the dog you picked out.

22:34.495 --> 22:37.215
But I hate dogs and you know that.

22:37.295 --> 22:39.896
No, you don't. You... You love dogs.

22:39.976 --> 22:43.536
I would have said anything
to get out of that room.

22:44.656 --> 22:47.657
I don't want a goddamn dog!

22:47.697 --> 22:51.497
And you know that, but you
got me one anyway, because you...

22:51.537 --> 22:55.258
- Okay. Okay, time out, Kathryn...
- Because you have no idea who I am.

22:55.338 --> 23:00.298
I mean, I might as well be invisible to you.
What color are my eyes, Bradley?

23:00.338 --> 23:02.899
- What?
- Yeah, what color are my eyes?

23:04.659 --> 23:06.899
- Green!
- Hazel!

23:06.979 --> 23:10.780
My eyes are hazel! I mean, Christ!
You're an artist!

23:10.860 --> 23:13.420
Okay, but there's a little greenish,
hazel tint.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.381
All right, listen,
we're rushing the dog thing.

23:15.461 --> 23:16.421
- You're right.
- No.

23:16.501 --> 23:19.221
No, it's not just the dog thing
or the eye thing. It's everything.

23:19.301 --> 23:22.581
It's every goddamn thing!
I cannot do this for one more day!

23:22.661 --> 23:24.822
- It's like I don't even exist!
- What? You're leaving?

23:24.902 --> 23:27.622
- Oh, so now you don't miss a thing.
- Where are you going with this?

23:27.702 --> 23:30.984
You know the shortstop,
the one that you asked over to our table?

23:31.064 --> 23:33.864
Yes! She tagged you out.

23:34.144 --> 23:38.105
Yeah, well,
I'm not the only one she tagged out.

23:38.185 --> 23:39.305
But you wouldn't know that,

23:39.385 --> 23:41.345
because you have your
head so far up your ass.

23:41.425 --> 23:43.865
Wait, you... You're friends with her?

23:47.426 --> 23:49.986
Wow. Goodbye, Bradley.

24:00.188 --> 24:02.988
If Kathryn's meant to be with women,
so be it,

24:03.948 --> 24:07.829
but I just can't help but think
maybe I did something to cause it.

24:08.909 --> 24:09.869
Mmm?

24:10.349 --> 24:12.429
To put her off men forever.

24:14.910 --> 24:19.030
But what? Never cheated.

24:20.350 --> 24:21.751
I didn't lie.

24:23.791 --> 24:26.311
I made love to her on a regular basis.

24:37.913 --> 24:40.233
She fell in love, that's all.

24:41.993 --> 24:43.193
One minute she was married,

24:43.273 --> 24:45.514
next minute there was this person
right in front of her,

24:45.594 --> 24:48.954
whom she couldn't ignore
no matter how hard she tried.

24:50.314 --> 24:52.195
How do you know that?

24:52.235 --> 24:56.635
Well, I was there when they met.
So were you.

24:59.036 --> 25:02.717
Bradley, look.
Try focusing on simple pleasures.

25:03.077 --> 25:05.237
You know? Small blessings.

25:06.438 --> 25:07.398
Hmm.

25:07.478 --> 25:09.038
Like... Like what?

25:11.078 --> 25:12.998
That's not for me to say.

25:14.639 --> 25:17.479
- I got my hair, right, Harry?
- There's a start.

25:17.559 --> 25:18.639
Okay.

25:20.719 --> 25:21.680
Well...

25:22.760 --> 25:27.000
- I got this place.
- Best espresso in Portland. The best!

25:28.281 --> 25:31.201
- I got my little dog.
- A loyal companion.

25:31.761 --> 25:33.321
I'm really sorry, Bradley,

25:33.401 --> 25:36.802
but you can't have the dog back.
We're going to keep him.

25:37.642 --> 25:39.082
Agatha, that's my dog.

25:39.122 --> 25:40.802
Not anymore. He's bonded with us.

25:40.882 --> 25:42.282
- No...
- His name is Gumbo now.

25:42.362 --> 25:43.803
Wait! Wait. Wait.

25:45.163 --> 25:46.243
We had a deal.

25:46.283 --> 25:49.083
Well, that was then and this is now.
I'm so sorry, Bradley,

but Billy loves the dog
and we love the dog.

Don't talk to me about love, okay?
My wife left me.

25:55.404 --> 25:57.444
- I know.
- Okay? For another woman.

25:57.484 --> 26:01.005
I'm alone, okay?
I want a dog. I need that dog!

My heart goes out to you, sweetie.
I think Kathryn is a selfish bitch.

26:05.446 --> 26:06.846
I think what you should do
is go straight to the pound

26:06.926 --> 26:09.766
- and pick yourself out another dog.
- We had a deal!

26:09.846 --> 26:13.567
I know. Well, I have to take it back.
It's null and void.

26:13.647 --> 26:16.247

26:16.327 --> 26:18.647
This is not a joke.
I'm talking about my stability, here.

26:18.727 --> 26:21.968
- I know. I'm really sorry, Bradley, but...
- No...

26:22.048 --> 26:25.608
As Billy's mother,
my responsibility is to him first, okay?

26:25.648 --> 26:27.409
- Good luck.
- No. No!

- Bonkers.
- Who's that?

- Bingo, the dog. I need this dog.
- But he's mine.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.241
See my face?

30:02.321 --> 30:04.801
- Yeah.
- Do I look scared?

30:05.801 --> 30:07.441
No. You look happy.

30:08.562 --> 30:10.282
You know why?

30:11.602 --> 30:13.802
Because I can pay those bills.

30:14.002 --> 30:19.123
We got tons of money
and I'm not scared of anything.

30:21.683 --> 30:24.364
All right, your turn.

30:26.644 --> 30:29.284
- My turn what?
- The future.

30:31.565 --> 30:36.245
- Close your eyes. What do you see?
- Okay.

30:38.566 --> 30:41.206
- Nothing.
- Just look.

30:45.447 --> 30:49.007
Okay, in the foyer, I see...

30:50.007 --> 30:51.407
A table...

30:52.527 --> 30:54.008
And...

30:55.128 --> 30:57.928
- A staircase.
- Excellent.

30:59.008 --> 31:00.689
I'm going up the stairs.

31:01.809 --> 31:03.529
Get to the top yet?

31:04.089 --> 31:05.330
Almost.

31:05.690 --> 31:07.611
What's up those stairs?

31:09.891 --> 31:11.891
Look, Oscar.

31:12.891 --> 31:14.371
Kids.

31:15.452 --> 31:17.652
So many kids I can't count.

31:19.092 --> 31:20.892
They're our kids.

31:22.012 --> 31:24.293
I was hoping you'd say that.

31:24.373 --> 31:27.013
- Really?
- I told you.

31:28.973 --> 31:30.974
I'm not scared of anything.

(SIGHING) Harry, I really feel like it's time
for me to get on with my life, you know?

32:15.420 --> 32:20.340
- Put the past behind me.
- That's a positive step, my friend.

32:20.420 --> 32:22.101
- Yeah.
- I gotta go.

32:26.101 --> 32:27.301
(INAUDIBLE)

32:29.702 --> 32:31.782
- Hi.
- Hey.

32:31.862 --> 32:35.582
Can I have a coffee? Large, black, to go.

32:35.622 --> 32:37.104
Thanks.

32:41.104 --> 32:44.145
- I think I've seen you in here before.
- Probably.

32:46.505 --> 32:48.265
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

32:51.066 --> 32:54.186
- You looking to buy a house?
- Sell one, actually.

32:56.906 --> 32:58.507
What about you?

32:59.547 --> 33:00.867
What about me?

33:00.907 --> 33:03.627
You're not looking to buy a house,
are you?

33:05.468 --> 33:07.868
- Rent, maybe.
- Really?

33:09.868 --> 33:13.469
- Well, sit down.
- Okay.

33:14.509 --> 33:15.469
Um...

33:16.149 --> 33:18.069
How many bedrooms?

33:18.229 --> 33:19.189
Uh...

33:19.749 --> 33:24.030
Two. One for me,
and maybe one for a little studio.

33:24.110 --> 33:26.190
- I paint sometimes.
- Okay.

33:26.510 --> 33:28.191
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

33:28.311 --> 33:30.751
The place that I have right now
is actually perfect,

33:30.831 --> 33:33.671
except it's haunted

33:34.751 --> 33:36.552
by a woman.

33:37.952 --> 33:39.472
She's a lesbian.

33:40.912 --> 33:43.593
My ex-wife left me for another woman.

33:45.353 --> 33:46.633
Oh, I see.

33:46.753 --> 33:48.513
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

33:48.633 --> 33:51.754
- Shit!
- No, we get this here. Hold on.

33:51.834 --> 33:54.194
- We get this a lot, actually.
- Yeah.

33:55.154 --> 33:57.835
They said this was going to be a big one,
but I didn't believe them.

33:57.915 --> 33:58.955
Yeah.

34:00.275 --> 34:03.795
- It looks like you've got that under control.
- You think?

34:04.836 --> 34:05.996
(LAUGHING)

34:07.157 --> 34:09.237
Do you mind if I smoke?

34:10.357 --> 34:11.476
No.

34:12.277 --> 34:13.358
Of course I did hear a rumor

34:13.438 --> 34:15.598
that those things are supposed to be
bad for your health.

34:15.678 --> 34:17.398
Not these. They're organic.

34:17.478 --> 34:19.879
Oh! Those are the ones that cure cancer.

34:20.279 --> 34:21.639
Exactly.

34:25.399 --> 34:27.560
Look at that. Brilliant.

34:27.639 --> 34:29.400
Not according to my ex.

34:29.480 --> 34:36.001
She said that I had my head
so far up my ass I never saw her.

34:37.801 --> 34:39.440
And was she right?

34:42.641 --> 34:44.202
I'm afraid so.

34:46.842 --> 34:48.683
So you're the honest type.

34:48.763 --> 34:49.842
To a fault.

35:00.604 --> 35:04.645
It's been really nice talking to you,
Bradley, but I gotta be somewhere.

35:07.925 --> 35:09.045
Call me.

35:14.486 --> 35:15.766
(MOANING)

35:26.768 --> 35:28.288
Yeah!

35:31.288 --> 35:32.728
DIANA: Oh, my God.

35:32.808 --> 35:37.289
David, this wine is excellent.
Do you want a glass?

35:39.370 --> 35:41.331
Well, that was quick.

35:42.691 --> 35:44.651
- Yeah.
- You gotta be somewhere?

35:44.731 --> 35:48.252
- Yeah, I gotta go. I'm sorry.
- What? You've got a meeting?

35:48.292 --> 35:50.812
Karen's car is in the shop.
I gotta pick up my son at swim practice.

35:50.892 --> 35:52.652
So, I've got about 10 minutes
to get across town.

35:52.732 --> 35:56.493
Listen. Tuesday. Noon.

35:56.773 --> 35:59.893
I will bring even better wine,
some lunch. I promise.

36:00.333 --> 36:01.973
I'm really sorry.

36:04.214 --> 36:07.054
- I can't do it.
- What do you mean?

36:09.374 --> 36:13.255
I have an appointment
to show somebody a house.

36:15.135 --> 36:16.815
- What? You can't change that?
- No, actually.

36:16.895 --> 36:22.216
It's this guy that I met, Bradley Smith.
Runs this little coffeehouse called Jitters.

36:22.296 --> 36:24.737
That's the only time he can make it.

36:29.897 --> 36:31.217
Okay.

36:34.378 --> 36:37.538
Well, I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.

- Hey.

37:57.670 --> 38:00.791
Honey, this isn't working out.

38:00.871 --> 38:02.471
You guys are gonna have to find a place
of your own.

38:02.551 --> 38:03.791
Yeah.

38:04.871 --> 38:08.992
I'm working on it.
Nothing in here we can afford. I...

38:13.072 --> 38:16.393
Well, I know a way you and Oscar
can make some money.

38:19.673 --> 38:21.433
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

38:31.475 --> 38:32.755
Thank you.

38:37.155 --> 38:38.716
I need some advice.

38:39.036 --> 38:40.117
Sure.

38:42.237 --> 38:45.638
Well, Oscar and I have been given
a business opportunity.

38:45.998 --> 38:47.758
Really?

38:47.838 --> 38:53.039
And if we were to make this... tape,

38:54.479 --> 38:58.039
it's not like it's something
we don't do all the time anyway.

39:00.080 --> 39:03.840
We could make, like, a thousand bucks,
if, you know, people order it.

39:03.920 --> 39:07.281
Oh, they'll order it.
Blind people will order it.

39:09.641 --> 39:11.241
Should we do it?

39:12.321 --> 39:15.122
You haven't told me
what you think about it.

39:15.842 --> 39:18.482

just for the money</i>

39:18.562 --> 39:20.642
<i>it would definitely be wrong.</i>

39:29.684 --> 39:30.884
What's wrong?

39:31.684 --> 39:32.604
(SIGHS)

39:34.244 --> 39:36.805
A young girl asked me for advice today.

39:37.645 --> 39:40.245
She was trying to decide
if she and her boyfriend

39:40.325 --> 39:43.926
should make a pornographic movie.

39:45.966 --> 39:47.686
I hope you told her no.

39:48.646 --> 39:49.926
I didn't.

39:51.127 --> 39:54.487
No, I tried to give her a perspective.

39:55.607 --> 39:59.448
I asked her questions. All very Socratic.

40:00.488 --> 40:06.009
I let her make up her own mind.
The same way I spoke to Aaron.

40:07.609 --> 40:09.970
- Sweetheart...
- What if I hadn't?

40:12.890 --> 40:17.091
What if I'd taken a stronger stance?

40:18.171 --> 40:21.892
What if I'd just told him,
"Son, this is right. This is wrong"?

40:21.972 --> 40:23.932
I mean, he wasn't my student,
for God's sake.

40:24.012 --> 40:25.492
He was my son.

40:34.613 --> 40:36.294
ESTHER: Look at me.

40:37.854 --> 40:39.294
Harry, please.

40:41.174 --> 40:44.775
You were a wonderful father. Nothing...

40:46.255 --> 40:49.095
Nothing that you could have done
would have stopped him.

40:49.135 --> 40:50.896
You don't know that.

40:51.696 --> 40:54.216
We don't know
what might have happened.

40:56.336 --> 40:57.497
Do we?

41:01.937 --> 41:03.337
Oh, Harry.

41:13.979 --> 41:15.899
DIANA: You like it?
BRADLEY: Yeah!

41:16.579 --> 41:19.339
It's pretty much
exactly what you asked for, Bradley.

41:19.379 --> 41:22.140
One bedroom plus a studio.

41:22.860 --> 41:25.420
But the important thing to remember
about this place is...

41:25.500 --> 41:28.901
The important thing
is whether or not you had fun last night.

41:28.981 --> 41:32.061
- Yes, I had a good time.
- What's that, Diana?

41:32.141 --> 41:36.662
- We always have a good time together.
- How come you never got married?

41:37.502 --> 41:40.062
Can we just stay on track here, Bradley,
for a minute?

41:40.142 --> 41:42.144
The owner will take a second mortgage,

41:42.224 --> 41:43.504
which means
that you can get out of renting...

41:43.584 --> 41:46.704
Is it because you never met anybody
as lovable as me?

41:47.904 --> 41:51.465
Are you ever going to buy a house,
or are you just jerking my chain?

41:55.865 --> 41:57.386
It's perfect.

42:00.586 --> 42:01.906
Really.

42:04.307 --> 42:05.707
I'll take it.

42:07.627 --> 42:09.187
Are you serious?

42:09.627 --> 42:12.148
Oh, my God,
I'm actually going to buy a house!

42:14.148 --> 42:17.708
I love this place, really.
It's perfect for you. It is.

42:22.469 --> 42:26.310
<i>And I can't react</i>

42:26.470 --> 42:29.590
Have I told you how grateful I am
you came into my life?

42:30.310 --> 42:32.990
Come on. You would have
found a place sooner or later.

42:33.070 --> 42:34.911
That's not what I mean.

That was amazing.

43:18.758 --> 43:21.558

That's a disgusting habit.

He's fine. Thank you for asking.

43:46.481 --> 43:49.602
Okay, I gotta know something.

43:53.682 --> 43:54.643

43:55.043 --> 44:00.363
Well, he's not stupid, or inconsiderate.

44:01.643 --> 44:06.724
He's not obnoxious, or violent,

44:06.804 --> 44:09.925
or boring, or annoying.

44:10.005 --> 44:12.885
He's not a bad dresser,
he's not unemployed,

44:12.965 --> 44:16.165
and he is not unhandsome, either.

44:17.726 --> 44:22.046
An absence of disqualifiers
is a rare and beautiful thing.

44:23.686 --> 44:26.887
Oh, and did I mention?
He's not married, either.

- But I thought...
- I changed my mind.

44:56.012 --> 44:59.492
Honestly, I just don't feel like
I can be of much help to them now.

44:59.572 --> 45:02.253
Don't be ridiculous. They're just kids.

- Anybody home?
- BRADLEY: Harry!

46:52.549 --> 46:54.269
What are you doing here?

46:54.309 --> 46:57.349
Well, I arrived about 28 years ago
and never left.

46:57.749 --> 46:59.310
I live next door.

47:00.190 --> 47:01.870
- Here?
- Yeah.

47:01.950 --> 47:04.550
That's fantastic! We're... I...

47:04.630 --> 47:06.271
- How did we never put that together?
- I don't know.

47:06.351 --> 47:08.671
Stranger things have happened. A re-gift.

47:08.751 --> 47:11.671
I'll use it to christen the fridge.

47:11.751 --> 47:13.191
It also makes a good doorstop.

47:13.271 --> 47:15.632
Hey, honey!
I want you to meet somebody.

47:15.712 --> 47:19.152
I can't believe it! You know,
I love this street. I love this area.

47:19.232 --> 47:22.273
Bradley, there's something
I need to share with you.

47:22.473 --> 47:25.993
This house has a history.

47:30.234 --> 47:33.034
Over the years, we've watched
happy young couples move in here

47:33.114 --> 47:35.715
and before you know it,
they're at each other's throats,

47:35.755 --> 47:38.875
and within weeks or months,
they're moving out.

47:38.955 --> 47:40.395
Separately.

47:40.475 --> 47:43.316
Now, this has happened
three times in a row.

47:44.197 --> 47:46.637
Now, I'm a man of logic.
I think it's just coincidence.

47:46.717 --> 47:48.877
But, Esther, my wife,

47:49.997 --> 47:52.998
she thinks supernatural forces
are at work.

47:53.038 --> 47:55.878
She thinks the place is cursed.

47:56.398 --> 47:57.679
Hi.

47:57.959 --> 47:59.239
Hi.

47:59.279 --> 48:02.119
Diana, this is Professor Harry Stevenson.

48:02.199 --> 48:03.599
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- Harry, this is Diana.

48:03.679 --> 48:04.719
Nice to meet you.

48:04.799 --> 48:08.160
My, my.
You're even more beautiful out of the rain.

48:09.200 --> 48:12.761
Now, how is it possible
that you were unattached?

48:13.281 --> 48:17.321
Well, I have impossibly high standards.

48:18.121 --> 48:20.482
So, you think this place is haunted?

48:20.922 --> 48:23.722
Well, my wife does.

48:25.482 --> 48:28.323
Well, that's okay.
We're not afraid of ghosts.

48:40.004 --> 48:41.444
Hey, what happened?

48:41.524 --> 48:43.525
Did you see the video guy?
Did you talk to him?

48:43.605 --> 48:45.445
- What'd he say?
- Yeah, easy, sleazy.

48:45.525 --> 48:47.645
- What'd he say?
- Here, here.

48:52.486 --> 48:53.646
That's it?

48:54.326 --> 48:57.007
- Two hundred and forty bucks?
- Well, nobody's ordering it.

48:57.087 --> 49:00.887
- What do you mean nobody's ordering it?
- It's not hot enough.

49:00.967 --> 49:02.847
- What?
- That's what he said.

49:02.927 --> 49:05.048
- It's totally hot. You said so yourself.
- Yeah, I know.

49:05.128 --> 49:08.008
But, I mean, I'm just a little old girl.

49:09.248 --> 49:13.569
You guys are too in love, he says.
You laugh and shit.

49:13.649 --> 49:16.530
I guess when it comes to porn,
that's a drag.

49:17.490 --> 49:20.211
This isn't enough for a place with a foyer.

49:21.091 --> 49:22.291
Hey.

49:23.891 --> 49:25.931
Hey, we all got dreams.

49:26.011 --> 49:28.692
I mean,
I want to buy new tits and a hybrid.

49:28.732 --> 49:29.972
Oh...

49:30.332 --> 49:32.412
Tell your friend he's an asshole.

50:05.817 --> 50:06.777
Yes?

50:06.857 --> 50:10.658
Hi. I left my bike out on the street.
Is it gonna be safe?

50:10.738 --> 50:12.818
Laurel and Hardy says it is.

50:12.898 --> 50:15.778
Tarot reading is $12, palm reading, $12.

50:15.898 --> 50:19.019
Guaranteed prediction of the future $20.

50:21.099 --> 50:23.539
Well, can't get the future for free.

50:27.620 --> 50:30.100
Okay, honey,
what you want to know about?

50:30.180 --> 50:32.901
I have this boyfriend, Oscar.

50:32.981 --> 50:35.461
Handsome boy, almost pretty.
That the one?

50:37.061 --> 50:40.022
Okay, we'll start with a palm reading.
You sit there.

50:48.144 --> 50:50.304
When did this Oscar pass over?

50:52.024 --> 50:54.064
Pass over? You mean die?

50:55.825 --> 50:59.345
No, Oscar didn't die. He's fine.
He's just fine.

51:03.626 --> 51:05.666
Well, we can always ask the cards.

51:30.829 --> 51:33.310
I've seen better cards, I'll say that.

51:33.390 --> 51:34.630
Honey...

51:35.990 --> 51:39.071
It's important to take the future
with a grain of salt.

51:39.151 --> 51:41.551
I want the truth, Mrs. Maggarolian.

51:42.591 --> 51:44.231
Both Laurel and Hardy are telling me

51:44.271 --> 51:48.552
that his future prospects are not so hot.

51:53.592 --> 51:57.593
I didn't see that much of your future,
so I'm gonna give you a little refund.

51:58.193 --> 51:59.513
Stop on your way home and get Oscar

51:59.593 --> 52:02.554
a couple of cheeseburgers
and some French fries.

52:02.634 --> 52:03.914
He'll love that.

52:06.514 --> 52:08.395
If you really love him...

52:11.115 --> 52:13.715
People can keep other people alive.

52:15.315 --> 52:16.877
Trust me on that.

52:19.477 --> 52:20.597
CHLOE: Oscar?

52:22.797 --> 52:23.878
Oscar.

52:25.998 --> 52:28.638
- Oscar, wake up.
- What? I'm up.

52:29.278 --> 52:30.639
Hi.

52:30.959 --> 52:32.559
- Hey.
- Hi.

52:33.199 --> 52:35.159
- What's that?
- I brought you cheeseburgers.

52:35.239 --> 52:38.320
Oh, nice.
I was just dreaming about cheeseburgers.

52:41.920 --> 52:42.960
Hey.

52:46.001 --> 52:47.241
Marry me.

52:49.041 --> 52:51.681
- What?
- Let's get married. You and me.

52:53.482 --> 52:54.642
Really?

52:55.802 --> 52:59.762
Yeah. Yes. Of course I'll marry you.

53:15.605 --> 53:20.045
She's sorry she couldn't be here.
She's writing up an offer.

53:20.125 --> 53:22.446
She's dying to meet you, by the way.

53:22.526 --> 53:24.686
From what I've seen out the window,
she's quite a looker.

53:24.766 --> 53:28.966
Oh, is she ever!
I mean, what the heck she sees in me I...

53:30.047 --> 53:31.767
I don't know.

53:31.807 --> 53:35.567
- Must be your inner beauty.
- Or all that free coffee.

53:35.607 --> 53:38.448
Honestly, I feel like
I'm the luckiest man alive. I...

53:38.488 --> 53:41.448
She is this force of nature.
I mean, she is so smart

53:41.528 --> 53:44.289
and so sexy.

53:44.369 --> 53:46.529
Totally unpredictable.

53:46.609 --> 53:52.371
It's like living with a wild animal, or...

53:52.451 --> 53:53.691
Never mind.

54:10.213 --> 54:11.733
David?

54:11.853 --> 54:12.813
Mmm?

54:17.414 --> 54:19.614
Bradley asked me to marry him.

54:24.015 --> 54:25.015
(CLEARS THROAT)

54:25.095 --> 54:26.975
Bradley, the coffee guy?

54:28.976 --> 54:29.936
Mmm-hmm.

54:33.896 --> 54:34.856
(LAUGHING)

54:38.217 --> 54:39.177
Uh...

54:40.457 --> 54:43.378
What did you say?
How did you get out of that one?

54:43.738 --> 54:46.978
I didn't, actually. I said yes.

54:51.979 --> 54:54.899
What do you mean, you said yes? You...

54:55.979 --> 54:59.380
You're going to marry him?
You're going to marry him.

55:05.020 --> 55:06.221
You're going to tear this guy apart.

55:06.301 --> 55:07.301
- You know that.
- Oh, come on.

55:07.381 --> 55:09.541
That's what you do to the
nice ones, Diana. Come on, I know you.

55:09.581 --> 55:12.021
- Oh, Jesus, David. I'm not that bad.
- I know every square inch of you.

55:12.101 --> 55:16.102
Yes, you are that bad.
You and me, we're the same like that.

55:16.182 --> 55:20.023
- We're mean and ill-tempered.
- Really? Well, not around Bradley, I'm not.

55:20.104 --> 55:23.544
When I'm with him, I'm nice.
I'm actually a nice person, David...

55:23.624 --> 55:24.904
- Really?
...some of the time.

55:24.944 --> 55:27.424
Okay. Well, if you're so fucking nice,
what are you doing here with me?

55:27.505 --> 55:29.825
I don't know. We're having sex, I guess.
That's what we do, you and me.

55:29.865 --> 55:34.705
We have sex and we drink wine.
We drink wine and we have sex.

55:39.306 --> 55:40.226
Yeah.

55:40.626 --> 55:41.626
Mmm-hmm.

55:41.706 --> 55:44.387
Okay. All right,
so if you are going to marry this guy...

55:44.427 --> 55:45.427
I am gonna marry him.

55:45.507 --> 55:46.627
If you're going to marry
this Bradley person

55:46.707 --> 55:49.227
shouldn't you at least
try to be with him exclusively?

55:49.267 --> 55:51.268
You're the one
with the wedding ring, not me.

55:51.348 --> 55:53.308
- Yeah, it's not the same thing.
- Yes, it is.

55:53.388 --> 55:54.348
No, it's not the same thing!

55:54.428 --> 55:56.348
You're going to enter into a marriage,
a first-timer.

55:56.428 --> 55:58.229
You haven't even tried to be faithful
to this guy?

55:58.309 --> 56:00.669
I was faithful to Karen
for 11 fucking years!

56:00.749 --> 56:01.989
I gave that marriage everything that I had.

56:02.069 --> 56:03.469
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- What have you given this guy, huh?

56:03.509 --> 56:04.910
What have you given him?
Do you even love him?

56:04.990 --> 56:07.990
- David, I'm done with this!
- Do you love him?

56:08.070 --> 56:10.350
I find him exceedingly lovable.

56:11.310 --> 56:13.231
Yeah, that's not what I asked.

56:13.311 --> 56:15.751
- Do you love him?
- I don't know, David. I suppose...

56:15.831 --> 56:17.431
Wake the fuck up!

56:19.071 --> 56:21.112
What is wrong with you?

56:21.192 --> 56:25.232
Get out of my house.
Get the fuck out of my house!

56:25.272 --> 56:27.073
No.

56:27.153 --> 56:29.873
You're gonna marry a guy that you're
not even sure you're in love with.

56:29.913 --> 56:32.273
You deserve to be slapped. You're a cunt.

56:38.154 --> 56:40.914
I'm gonna walk outside right now,

56:40.994 --> 56:43.715
because I think that would be best
for both of us.

56:45.235 --> 56:48.195
- You're not dressed.
- I don't give a flying fuck!

57:16.080 --> 57:17.520
David.

57:17.760 --> 57:19.161
Don't say anything.

57:19.201 --> 57:25.401
Can we... Can we just stop for a minute
and, please, can we just talk about this?

57:25.482 --> 57:29.362
I think it would be better
if we just don't see each other again.

57:30.402 --> 57:36.123
- David, please don't say that.
- This is a mistake you're making, Diana.

57:37.563 --> 57:39.203
This is a soul mistake.

57:55.526 --> 57:58.646
<i>JUSTICE OF THE PEACE: And do you, Diana,
take this man to have and to hold,</i>

57:58.686 --> 58:03.527
for better or for worse, for richer,
for poorer, in sickness and in health,

58:03.607 --> 58:08.407
to love and to cherish from this day
forward till death do you part?

58:14.968 --> 58:16.128
I do.

58:17.289 --> 58:19.649
You may now exchange the rings.

58:25.731 --> 58:27.811
You first. Then me.

58:27.891 --> 58:29.051
There you go.

58:29.131 --> 58:31.972
By the powers vested in me
by the laws of the state of Oregon,

58:32.012 --> 58:35.532
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

58:45.013 --> 58:47.494
(BAND MUSIC PLAYING)

59:03.336 --> 59:04.736
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if we could do that

59:04.816 --> 59:06.816
with everything we found uncomfortable?

59:06.856 --> 59:09.017
Kick it off into a flower bed?

59:10.017 --> 59:12.457
Hey, you in the suit.

59:12.537 --> 59:14.937
It's a wedding, not a funeral.
What's the matter?

59:15.017 --> 59:17.418
I'm just not feeling very festive.

59:18.698 --> 59:20.018
- You know what might help?
- What?

59:20.098 --> 59:21.738
If you faked it.

59:22.098 --> 59:25.139
Come on, let's show them how it's done.
Come on.

59:25.419 --> 59:26.859
(SLOW DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

59:27.939 --> 59:28.899
(INAUDIBLE)

59:31.180 --> 59:32.540
Esther's amazing.

59:35.540 --> 59:37.380
I'll have to agree with you.

59:37.460 --> 59:39.181
Can I trust her with Oscar?

59:39.701 --> 59:40.701
Mmm...

59:40.781 --> 59:42.381
Hard to say.

59:42.421 --> 59:45.742
I mean, she's a passionate woman
with needs, you know?

59:46.662 --> 59:49.182
Hey, how come you two never had kids?

59:51.703 --> 59:53.984
- I'm sorry, I just...
- We did.

59:55.064 --> 59:56.304
A son.

59:57.504 --> 59:59.544
Aaron died last year

01:00:00.865 --> 01:00:03.785
of a heroin overdose.

01:00:06.105 --> 01:00:07.625
Here. Come, sit.

01:00:11.786 --> 01:00:14.346
His death was hard enough to accept.

01:00:15.867 --> 01:00:18.427
Almost as hard was the fact that

01:00:21.267 --> 01:00:24.108
we had no idea he had a drug problem.

01:00:26.188 --> 01:00:30.629
I mean, he was a top student.
He was a doctor.

01:00:31.709 --> 01:00:36.469
When the police called,
we were sure that this was a mistake.

01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:38.470
He had, like, a secret life.

01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:42.230
And I don't know why.

01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:45.991
Every day I try to figure it out.

01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:48.951
The first sign.

01:00:50.071 --> 01:00:51.992
The moment I didn't see.

01:00:58.512 --> 01:01:01.433
A bit of unsolicited advice for you,

01:01:01.513 --> 01:01:04.313
as soon as you get married, have a baby.

01:01:04.393 --> 01:01:06.834
And as soon as you've done that,
have another one.

01:01:06.914 --> 01:01:11.434
- Have at least two. Okay? Two.
- Okay, two.

01:01:11.514 --> 01:01:12.874
Atta girl.

01:01:23.637 --> 01:01:26.237
Hey, I'm gonna ask you a question, okay?

01:01:26.317 --> 01:01:27.837
All right.

01:01:29.638 --> 01:01:32.438
Oscar and me really need parents.

01:01:33.518 --> 01:01:36.319
Mine are dead,
and Oscar's only got the Bat.

01:01:39.239 --> 01:01:41.319
Would you and Esther adopt us?

01:01:43.079 --> 01:01:44.880
You know, unofficially.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:55.161
That's cool. You need time.
Just think about it.

01:02:20.765 --> 01:02:21.885
Ta-da.

01:02:25.205 --> 01:02:26.325
Voilà.

01:02:27.045 --> 01:02:28.246
Thanks.

01:02:30.086 --> 01:02:34.126
- Hey, you hesitated today. How come?
- When?

01:02:34.206 --> 01:02:38.247
Just towards the end of the ceremony,
right before the "I do."

01:02:40.007 --> 01:02:41.207

Oh, right. The two-story Georgian.

- On Walnut Street.

I left the house, I asked my wife,
"Do you have the directions?"

She said, "I don't have the directions."

01:07:45.773 --> 01:07:47.013
I'm like, "Well, I don't have the directions."

01:07:47.093 --> 01:07:49.453
So we get in the car and start driving
and I use my little thing,

01:07:49.533 --> 01:07:51.373
and I press the button
and put the address in

01:07:51.413 --> 01:07:53.174

from the left collar.

was a mistake
