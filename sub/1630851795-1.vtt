00:10.244 --> 00:12.478
[laid-back music playing]

00:15.149 --> 00:17.316
we've been through
bit of a rough spot.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.618
But things are starting
to pick back up again.

00:26.127 --> 00:29.028
<i>  The economy is starting</i>
<i>  to rebound.</i>

00:29.030 --> 00:31.530
Folks are out
and they're ready
to celebrate.

00:32.867 --> 00:35.567
<i>  Demand's high</i>
<i>  for premium liquor right now.</i>

00:37.671 --> 00:40.005
It's boom time for moonshine.

00:40.007 --> 00:42.808
<i> [narrator] on this season</i>
<i>  of moonshiners...</i>

00:42.810 --> 00:45.144
[mark]
it's coming on good, chris,
let's put some grain in it.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.612
People are working again,

00:46.614 --> 00:50.115
they've got money to spend.
So I'm ready to do my part,

00:50.117 --> 00:53.118
see that they have plenty
of spirits to celebrate with.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.019
[henry] that's good.

00:54.021 --> 00:55.621
There's more pots right here

00:55.623 --> 00:58.257
<i>  than most moonshiners</i>
<i>  could ever hope to cook</i>

00:58.259 --> 00:59.358
<i>  through in their life.</i>

00:59.360 --> 01:02.127
[digger] I'm taking
you to the shrine, boys.

01:02.129 --> 01:04.963
[mark] oh, my god!
This is where you

01:04.965 --> 01:07.199
and popcorn sutton
made his last brandy.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.902
<i> [mike] this is where</i>
<i>  the infamous</i>
<i>  popcorn sutton's from,</i>

01:09.904 --> 01:11.870
but it's mine and jerry's
turn now.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.372
[mike] man,
look at the waterfall
in there.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.973
-[henry] I like it.
-[mike] I do too.

01:14.975 --> 01:16.175
Oh, I can see the fairy.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.910
The green fairy,
that's it.

01:17.912 --> 01:19.411
Changes right
before your eyes.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.914
The mad scientist
came through again.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.282
Then we got something out.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.451
You make sure you get
between them
little toes there.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.352
-[laughs]
-pretty good.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.888
-Bigfoot moonshine.
-[laughs]

01:29.890 --> 01:31.723
-you've been with me 12 years.
-Twelve years.

01:31.725 --> 01:32.858
Keep up our anniversary date.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.893
I didn't know
we had an anniversary.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.361
[brian]
what's in the edibles barrel?

01:36.363 --> 01:37.629
[josh] pineapple.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.266
Wait, that says "non-edibles."

01:41.268 --> 01:43.202
-is it sweet?
-Yeah, pretty good.

01:43.204 --> 01:46.972
Burns hotter than a nanny goat
in a pepper patch,
picking six rows at a time.

01:46.974 --> 01:49.341
-That's pretty damn hot.
-Don't splash that
on your leg.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.143
Could be doing
the burnt sack boogie.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.311
[laughs]

01:52.313 --> 01:54.012
you done skinned a gator,
josh!

01:54.014 --> 01:57.149
One thing's for sure.
My name's not good luck chuck.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.385
-[tires screech]
-whoa!

02:00.387 --> 02:02.054
God almighty!

02:02.056 --> 02:03.355
Son of a bitch!

02:03.357 --> 02:04.823
Burn it down!

02:04.825 --> 02:06.191
[mike] okay, come on.
Let's get on up there.

02:06.193 --> 02:07.759
<i>  It's like a crime scene.</i>

02:07.761 --> 02:09.061
<i>  You go back for that bastard.</i>

02:09.063 --> 02:11.830
That's when 90%
of the time you get caught.

02:11.832 --> 02:15.134
The police is coming back
with a vengeance.

02:15.136 --> 02:16.835
[police chief]
what's going on, fellas?

02:16.837 --> 02:18.070
[officer 1]
check them barrels.

02:18.072 --> 02:20.072
I'm gonna solder it
from the inside.

02:20.074 --> 02:21.940
Oh, damn!

02:21.942 --> 02:24.176
When it starts squeezing down,
slow down on it.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.845
-Ahhh!
-Son of a bitch.

02:26.847 --> 02:29.748
See, that pandemic,
it was like
the great depression.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.817
<i>  Now that everybody</i>
<i>  is coming out of it,</i>

02:31.819 --> 02:35.053
it's gonna be like
the roaring '20s
all over again.

02:36.257 --> 02:39.391
<i> [mark] this is how</i>
<i>  we make the moonshine!</i>

02:43.931 --> 02:46.899
<i> [narrator] as the icy shadow</i>
<i>  of winter fades</i>

02:46.901 --> 02:49.768
<i> and the last frost melts away,</i>

02:49.770 --> 02:51.136
<i>  a spirit of renewal</i>

02:51.138 --> 02:54.206
<i>  fills the vast expanse</i>
<i>  of appalachia,</i>

02:54.208 --> 02:56.608
<i>  and like generations</i>
<i>  before them,</i>

02:56.610 --> 03:00.012
<i>  moonshiners spring</i>
<i>  into action.</i>

03:00.014 --> 03:01.180
[mark] here we are,

03:01.182 --> 03:04.183
make us a little more
tennessee whiskey.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.221
Oh, yeah.
Still around and pretty.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.190
[narrator]
<i>  in cocke county, tennessee,</i>

03:11.192 --> 03:14.226
<i>  mark and digger return</i>
<i>  to the limestone spring</i>

03:14.228 --> 03:17.696
<i>  that makes their outlaw</i>
<i>  tennessee whiskey possible.</i>

03:17.698 --> 03:20.265
-[mark]
it's backed up a little.
-Yeah, let me get the shovel.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.968
That'll bring it out there
once I shovel
that sediment up.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.102
[mark] okay.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.872
Damn.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.907
Boy, getting older
ain't for sissies, is it?

03:28.909 --> 03:30.576
No, it ain't.

03:30.578 --> 03:33.879
During the winter months,
we rented a little
warehouse from a friend.

03:33.881 --> 03:37.683
<i>  It's right next to the one</i>
<i>  of the finest limestone</i>
<i>  springs we know of.</i>

03:37.685 --> 03:39.618
[mark] if there's just a leak
right over here...

03:39.620 --> 03:43.222
So, mark and I got to develop
this tennessee whiskey.

03:43.224 --> 03:46.291
<i>  Everybody's wanting it,</i>
<i>  so we're gonna run</i>
<i>  hard with it.</i>

03:47.194 --> 03:49.861
Well, let's give that time
to clear up, let's go inside.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.364
[mark] see what kind of mess
we got inside to clean up.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.866
You know, last year
we cut our prices.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.468
We were trying
to help folks out.

03:56.470 --> 04:00.038
<i>  We stuck</i>
<i>  with simple corn liquor</i>
<i>  and sold a lot of it.</i>

04:00.040 --> 04:01.807
Sure am spooky in here.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.508
<i> [digger] this year,</i>
<i>  things are better.</i>

04:03.510 --> 04:05.777
People are getting out
and they've got their pockets
full of money.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.280
<i>  Everybody's wanting</i>
<i>  to spend that money</i>
<i>  on a premium liquor</i>

04:08.282 --> 04:10.515
<i>  and we're at a fever pitch</i>
<i>  to make 'em some.</i>

04:14.188 --> 04:16.255
Do you hear anything,
you feel anything?

04:16.357 --> 04:17.489
[digger] nope.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.558
[mark] pretty good
ways over here.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.126
[both] there we go.

04:21.128 --> 04:23.629
We got to run this pump
for a few minutes
to clear out muddy sediment

04:23.631 --> 04:26.231
and once we get clean water,

04:26.233 --> 04:28.267
make us a little mash,
get ready to start making

04:28.269 --> 04:30.969
little bit
of tennessee whiskey
mark and digger style.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.004
[digger] that's still working.

04:32.006 --> 04:33.005
[mark] yeah.

04:33.007 --> 04:34.406
[digger]
three more barrels filled up,

04:34.408 --> 04:35.540
that ought to be about right

04:35.542 --> 04:37.976
and rotate them coming off
three or four at a time.

04:37.978 --> 04:42.114
That'll be good. I mean,
I ain't greedy, but this year
is a lot different than

04:42.116 --> 04:43.849
last year, people has got
a little money now.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.083
Yeah, boy.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.919
You know,
last year was a whole
different animal for us.

04:47.921 --> 04:51.256
We were all about making
cheap liquor to what
people could afford it.

04:51.258 --> 04:54.459
This year, we're going
to make top-shelf liquor

04:54.461 --> 04:57.062
that we can charge
a premium price for.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.930
Oh, it's ready to go,
ain't it?

04:58.932 --> 05:00.699
It didn't get no mildew
or nothing.

05:00.701 --> 05:04.269
We got enough grain here
to make one run of mash,
you think?

05:04.271 --> 05:07.873
[digger] with that barrel
of white corn in my truck,
we're ready to rock and roll.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.274
[mark] let's get
the pump and stuff first.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.409
Get those drying.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.012
Hello, fellas.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.624
We had a pretty good winter.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.292
For the first winter
you've ever had?

05:27.294 --> 05:29.061
-[brian] yeah.
-You got a horseshoe

05:29.063 --> 05:29.961
stuck in your ass.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.797

05:45.746 --> 05:48.146

They helped us a lot.

<i> [josh] working with henry,</i>

05:52.986 --> 05:53.885
<i> [narrator] last winter...</i>

05:53.887 --> 05:55.287

all right, boys, here it is.

There's a whole lot
of subs right here.

06:00.627 --> 06:01.893
Whole lot of subs.

<i> [josh] this year, we're going</i>
<i>  to keep working with henry,</i>
<i>  kenny and tickle.</i>

06:13.741 --> 06:17.008
We got these ginormous stills,
killer still setup,

06:17.010 --> 06:18.977
<i>  but we're gonna</i>
<i>  do something</i>
<i>  a little bit different.</i>

06:18.979 --> 06:20.912
Well, last year, with you,

06:20.914 --> 06:23.815
we basically only done grain.
With fruits coming in,

06:23.817 --> 06:25.250
we can make
some high-end brandies

06:25.252 --> 06:27.252
and we'll be able to charge
a little bit more for it.

06:27.254 --> 06:29.988
Lord knows everybody's out
spending that money right now.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.090
Last year was like
the great depression,

06:32.092 --> 06:34.226
<i>  but this year,</i>
<i>  people are making money.</i>

06:34.228 --> 06:37.095
Everything is just packed,
everywhere you go.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.864
I got a lot of 'em down here.

06:38.866 --> 06:39.898
Some strawberries
have come in.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.233
We're going

06:41.235 --> 06:43.101
to make some killer strawberry
brandy and...

06:43.103 --> 06:45.270
How many strawberries
you got lined up?

06:45.272 --> 06:46.872
Enough to run
all those stills, you know.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.907
Hell, we're gonna have
damn arthritis

06:48.909 --> 06:51.009
by the time we get done
cutting all them tops off.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.377
[laughs]

06:52.379 --> 06:54.980
<i> [josh] right now, strawberries</i>
<i> have been in real high demand.</i>

06:54.982 --> 06:56.748
I've called
all over the place,

06:56.750 --> 07:00.185
haven't been able to hardly
locate any quantity anywhere.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.454
<i>  But our boy colt</i>
<i>  come to the rescue.</i>

07:02.456 --> 07:03.789
<i>  We're here to pick 'em up.</i>

07:03.791 --> 07:04.956
What's up, man?

07:04.958 --> 07:06.291
[colt] not much.
Staying out of trouble?

07:06.293 --> 07:08.059
-Trying to.
-[laughs]

07:08.061 --> 07:10.095
-[brian]
staying out of trouble.
-[josh] yeah.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.364
-Show us what you got.
-[colt] ah, let me go get 'em.

07:12.866 --> 07:15.033

what do you think about these?

07:17.905 --> 07:18.937

07:18.939 --> 07:20.739
-Hell yeah.
-[brian] oh, man,
they look good.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.340
-They're perfect.
-[josh] all right.

07:22.342 --> 07:25.043
If you don't mind,
we'll take this one barrel
in there first,

07:25.045 --> 07:27.479
and then we'll put the bulk
of them on the truck.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.148
Wait a minute.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.050
They're not exactly perfect.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.318
They're soft.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.687
God,
that one there is rotten.

07:35.689 --> 07:36.855
Some of them are just ripe,

07:36.857 --> 07:39.224
and some of them are damn near
just plum rotten.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.693
[brian] how long do you think
before these are mush?

07:41.695 --> 07:43.962
Maybe a couple of hours,
maybe tonight, I mean...

07:43.964 --> 07:46.231
Yeah. Some of them don't even
have hours, they're gone.

07:46.233 --> 07:49.134
It ain't nothing for us
moonshiners
to use some overripe fruit.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.770
<i>  But when you got to bring</i>
<i>  it to virginia in the heat,</i>

07:51.772 --> 07:53.905
<i>  then there's black,</i>
<i>  moldy spots all over 'em,</i>

07:53.907 --> 07:55.640
they're just not satisfactory.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.108
The next time,
if you can hook us up

07:57.110 --> 08:00.111
just before it gets
to that point,
that'd be great.

08:00.113 --> 08:03.782
<i>  Henry, kenny and tickle,</i>
<i>  they're totally expecting</i>
<i>  strawberries,</i>

08:03.784 --> 08:06.151
<i>  but these strawberries</i>
<i>  will not work.</i>

08:06.153 --> 08:07.719
If you got something else
in the future,

08:07.721 --> 08:09.354
man, and it ain't quite ripe,

08:09.356 --> 08:11.490
and we definitely... You've
got our number, hook us up.

08:11.492 --> 08:12.824
I promised henry,
kenny and tickle

08:12.826 --> 08:14.993
I was gonna get 'em
a huge load of strawberries.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.996
<i>  Well, I'm a man of my word,</i>
<i>  so I got to come up</i>
<i>  with some fruit.</i>

of making corn liquor,

08:22.269 --> 08:24.870
I want to make a big run
of something special,

08:24.872 --> 08:26.104

how to plant
your own groceries,

08:44.258 --> 08:45.824
man, we'd have starved
to death last year.

08:45.826 --> 08:48.293
[narrator]
<i> it's sevier county, tennessee.</i>

08:48.295 --> 08:52.197
<i>  After police paid a visit</i>
<i>  to a stash house last winter,</i>

08:52.199 --> 08:57.235
<i>  mike is keeping a low profile</i>
<i>  to avoid getting</i>
<i>  caught in a sting operation.</i>

08:57.237 --> 09:00.505
[mike] we're talking over
a 150 gallons alcohol
in that barn.

09:00.507 --> 09:03.074
When the law found
our stash house,

09:03.076 --> 09:06.444
we went from wide open
to a dead stop.

09:06.446 --> 09:09.314
-There's damn cops
up there, man.
-Holy damn.

09:09.316 --> 09:10.882
-Just drive by.
-[bleep].

09:10.884 --> 09:12.951
They're gonna get
our asses for sure now.

09:12.953 --> 09:16.054
That's our whole damn
season gone to hell.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.723
Ain't been back,
ain't made another dollar.

09:18.725 --> 09:22.160
Ain't made no liquor.
Ain't sold nothing.

09:22.162 --> 09:25.964
So what little bit
of pocket change I had
left over, is gone.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.133
I've not even been back
to my still site.

09:28.135 --> 09:31.736
I've been laying low,
staying at home, trying
to can up canned goods.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.305
We can a little bit
of everything,

09:33.307 --> 09:37.075
homemade barbecue sauces,
pepper relish, whole tomatoes.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.444
We've just been relying
on what we got at home,
you know, to get by.

09:39.446 --> 09:43.415
You know, me and jerry,
we hadn't made or sold
any liquor for months.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.216
<i> I'm broke as a joke right now.</i>

09:45.218 --> 09:46.384
[horn honks]

09:46.386 --> 09:48.086
jerry.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.621
Mikey-mikey, what's up, buddy?

09:49.623 --> 09:51.056
Been laying low about you say.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.791
-I know the feeling.
-Good to see you.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.492
I don't know about you,
but I'm ready to get started.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.127
We took a serious hit
last season.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.996
Yeah, we did.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.764
I don't know if I'm about
ready to get back
in the woods or not.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.266
You haven't been back
to the still house, have you?

10:01.268 --> 10:03.034
Ain't been no damn
where else.

10:03.036 --> 10:06.271
Not to the still site,
the stash house, nothing.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.373
I say we go down there
and check it out
and scope it out

10:08.375 --> 10:10.108
and see what we can
come up with.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.243
You think
it's been long enough?

10:12.245 --> 10:14.379
[jerry]
if they found anything,
they've got it and gone.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.614
And it's done and over with.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.315
That's 150 gallons,
if it's still there,

10:17.317 --> 10:19.951
we got a damn good start
to the season, you know.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.789
It's against
my damn better judgment,

10:24.791 --> 10:26.291
but if it is in there boy,

10:26.293 --> 10:27.626
we'd have some money
in our pocket.

10:27.628 --> 10:28.760
Damn right.

10:28.762 --> 10:29.861
I got a damn notion

10:29.863 --> 10:31.630
we ain't gonna
find nothing over there.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.698
I hope like hell
that liquor is still there,

10:33.700 --> 10:34.966
<i>  because if it is,</i>

10:34.968 --> 10:36.334
<i>  we're pretty much</i>
<i>  where we left off,</i>

10:36.336 --> 10:37.869
<i>  you know,</i>
<i>  we'll be in good shape.</i>

10:37.871 --> 10:39.938
But the law was there,

10:40.407 --> 10:42.040
chances are that
liquor is gone,

10:42.042 --> 10:43.341
unless they're just
waiting for us

10:43.343 --> 10:45.610
to come back
so they can bust our asses.

10:47.547 --> 10:50.248
Oh, boy,
I don't like this damn idea.

10:54.221 --> 10:57.889
We just need to sit here
and scope this place out
a little bit.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.959
I hope like hell, there ain't
nobody stirring around.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.897
Should've brought a damn
roll of toilet paper.

11:05.899 --> 11:08.233
<i>  We've got to go back</i>
<i>  to that stash house,</i>

11:08.235 --> 11:11.503
we've got to see
for our own eyes
if anything's there or not.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.104
But, you know, we're not
just gonna pull up

11:13.106 --> 11:14.739
in the front damn door
and walk in.

11:14.741 --> 11:16.675
<i>  We're gonna scope</i>
<i>  this place out.</i>

11:16.677 --> 11:20.311
<i>  We're looking for activity</i>
<i>  of any kind whatsoever.</i>

11:20.313 --> 11:23.515
We gotta watch for people,
come by and see our asses.

11:23.517 --> 11:24.983
Oh, yeah.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.419
Hmm.

11:27.421 --> 11:30.188
I hope there ain't nobody up
on that damn bank up yonder.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.057
I am a little paranoid,

11:32.059 --> 11:34.959
but you got to be
if you're gonna be
in this business.

11:37.731 --> 11:41.199
You think we ought to
just get out and see
what we can find out?

11:41.201 --> 11:43.435
We're gonna hug the edges
of them bushes

11:43.437 --> 11:46.304
right there by the creek,
slipp in there
on the back side.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.273
A little bit more incognito.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.442
-Might as well do it.
-Let's do it.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.616
[mike]
wait here a minute, jerry...

11:58.618 --> 12:00.485
<i>  It seems like</i>
<i>  there's nobody around here,</i>

12:00.487 --> 12:02.887
but they could be hoarded up
inside that stash house

12:02.889 --> 12:04.989
waiting for me
to unlock the door.

12:04.991 --> 12:07.058
[jerry] is it just me
or has someone been
cleaning up in there?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.327
Somebody has done
some cleaning up.

12:09.329 --> 12:12.030
That whole hallway looks like
it's cleared up, gone.

12:13.366 --> 12:14.866
Let's get on up there.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.134
-[jerry] let's go for it.
-[mike] yeah.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.303
[tense music playing]

12:31.885 --> 12:33.985
[tense music continues]

12:36.857 --> 12:38.690
[breathes heavily]

12:38.692 --> 12:41.259
okay, jerry, nothing.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.797
They took every damn
bit of it, buddy,
like I figured.

12:45.799 --> 12:46.998
[jerry] holy cow.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.134
-Nothing but dirt.
-The cops got it.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.769
Somebody got it.
It ain't here.

12:50.771 --> 12:53.238
We can spend
all damn day long
about who may have it,

12:53.240 --> 12:55.240
but it's... It's theirs now.

12:55.242 --> 12:58.042
But we got our answer
and I don't want to be
here no damn longer.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.177
-Me neither.
-Let's go.

12:59.746 --> 13:00.979
Damn.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.018
[jerry] I tell you what,
they're pretty hot on us here.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.887
[mike] oh, tell me about it.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.989
[jerry] yeah, we haven't
been to the still site yet,
it may even be worse.

13:10.991 --> 13:14.259
We ain't been
to the old still site
since the whole law incident,

13:14.261 --> 13:16.094
but we left everything
over there.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.862
I hope
everything's still there,

13:17.864 --> 13:19.664
but it won't be our damn
still site no more,

13:19.666 --> 13:20.899
that's for sure.

13:20.901 --> 13:23.668
We'll go drop off this
old truck, get in our other...

13:23.670 --> 13:26.004
And get her cleaned up
and move on.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.273
You know,
a fresh start might be
a better start.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.542
Maybe a blessing
in the damn skies.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.511
[dramatic music playing]

13:39.853 --> 13:41.152
[police chief speaking]

13:43.857 --> 13:46.324
ah, nothing,
little spring cleaning.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.960
[police chief speaking]

14:11.051 --> 14:12.150
we don't know.
Everything was here

14:12.152 --> 14:14.419
when we got here. It must be
some sort of water filter.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.955
[officer 1 speaking]

14:16.957 --> 14:18.323
[police chief speaking]

14:20.227 --> 14:21.926
[officer 1 speaking]

14:21.928 --> 14:23.394
yeah, those are empty barrels.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.096
[police chief speaking]

14:25.098 --> 14:26.264
[officer 2 speaking]

14:27.801 --> 14:29.133
[police chief speaking]

14:34.407 --> 14:36.541
-[mark] I understand.
-[police chief speaking]

14:38.445 --> 14:40.078
yes, sir. Yes, sir.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.390
[mark] fair enough.

14:55.028 --> 14:58.263
[digger] son of a bitch.
This day didn't start
like I wanted it to.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.165
[mark] no, but thank the lord,
it ain't tomorrow.

15:01.167 --> 15:03.034
[digger] if it'd been
tomorrow, baby boy,

15:03.036 --> 15:04.302
we'd have had
an allergic reaction.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.638
We'd have broke out
in handcuffs.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.706
As far as making liquor
goes right now,

15:08.708 --> 15:10.008
there will be no liquor

15:10.010 --> 15:12.944
made inside
the corporate city limits
in newport.

15:12.946 --> 15:15.179
<i>  Now, are we going</i>
<i>  to stop altogether?</i>

15:15.181 --> 15:18.516
Quitters, they have to
go to meetings,
we ain't quitters.

15:18.518 --> 15:22.186
<i>  We're gonna get</i>
<i>  the hell out of here,</i>
<i>  and we ain't gonna look back.</i>

15:35.468 --> 15:37.068
[kenny speaking]

15:37.070 --> 15:40.004
[henry speaking]

15:40.006 --> 15:41.973
[narrator]
<i>  in franklin county, virginia,</i>

<i>  over 600 gallons</i>

15:44.844 --> 15:48.146
<i>  of malted corn liquor</i>
<i>  in a friend's barn</i>
<i>  last winter,</i>

<i>  henry and kenny break down</i>
<i>  the eight-still operation</i>

15:51.985 --> 15:55.386
<i>  to make the springtime</i>
<i>  move back into the woods.</i>

15:55.388 --> 15:56.888
[sighs]

15:56.890 --> 15:58.289
it's gonna be
very dangerous this year.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.857
<i>  The law is getting out again,</i>

15:59.859 --> 16:01.893
<i>  so we got to move</i>
<i>  to a new site.</i>

16:01.895 --> 16:03.294
We're gonna be able
to use it the whole season.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.963
All right.

16:04.965 --> 16:08.232
Wow, looks like
you boys are busy
already this morning.

16:11.871 --> 16:12.904
Made a pile.

16:12.906 --> 16:14.138
-[henry laughs]
-made a pile of money.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.341
We're not staying
at this still site.

16:16.343 --> 16:19.444
It's gonna be too much
traffic coming by
with these horses,

16:19.446 --> 16:21.245
people cutting hay
and all that.

16:21.247 --> 16:22.680
You know what?

16:22.682 --> 16:24.215
I'm good at building,
but I can tell you something

16:24.217 --> 16:26.250
about all the pieces,
ain't got a lot, do you?

16:26.252 --> 16:28.119
<i>  Well, you know,</i>
<i>  you set up eight subs,</i>

16:28.121 --> 16:30.355
takes three
or four days to set them up,

16:30.357 --> 16:32.423
it takes 30 minutes
to tear them down.

16:32.792 --> 16:35.193
[henry speaking]

16:35.195 --> 16:39.030
<i> [tickle] even though</i>
<i>  I don't really want</i>
<i>  to tear this still site down,</i>

16:39.032 --> 16:42.166
moonshiner's got to do
what a moonshiner's
got to do.

16:42.168 --> 16:46.838
<i>  Let's face it,</i>
<i> it was a beautiful still site,</i>
<i>  but we've got to move.</i>

16:46.840 --> 16:48.339
All right.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.342
That's a pile of them
right yonder.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.011
Henry, have you given
any thought to where

16:53.013 --> 16:54.345
we're gonna put
these things at?

16:54.347 --> 16:55.713
[henry] you know I have.

16:55.715 --> 16:56.848
But I'll make sure
we get the right spot

16:56.850 --> 16:58.983
-and everybody's
happy with this.
-[tickle] right.

16:58.985 --> 17:01.185
If we ain't at the right spot,
ain't no sense in even
starting making liquor.

17:01.187 --> 17:03.755
<i>  Before josh gets here</i>
<i>  with all these strawberries,</i>

17:03.757 --> 17:07.191
we got to find someplace
else to put these things,

17:07.193 --> 17:09.193
<i>  'cause when he gets here,</i>
<i> we need to mash 'em things in.</i>

17:09.195 --> 17:12.463
We can't have 'em going
bad on us before we can
even get them in the pot.

17:15.368 --> 17:18.603
[henry]
<i>  a good quality still site,</i>
<i>  that's what we want.</i>

17:18.605 --> 17:20.038
There's a lot of things
you got to look for.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.672
The biggest thing is water.

17:21.674 --> 17:24.208
<i>  Of course, the next thing</i>
<i>  is seclusion.</i>

17:24.210 --> 17:28.646
Last year, it was very easy
to find still sites,
'cause nobody was out.

17:28.648 --> 17:33.217
Now, everybody's out hiking,
everybody is out kayaking,
full willing.

17:33.219 --> 17:36.287
You name it,
they're out doing it now,
especially now.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.058
I tell you what.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.226
That's a nice hole
of water right there, henry.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.328
<i> [tickle] we come up here</i>
<i>  to the still site</i>

17:44.330 --> 17:46.831
<i>  that henry wants to show us</i>
<i>  and tell you what,</i>

17:46.833 --> 17:48.933
this thing is looking good.

17:48.935 --> 17:50.601
It's coming down
through the ice.

17:51.871 --> 17:52.904
Ice cold, too.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.906
[tickle]
<i> there's a beautiful waterfall.</i>

17:54.908 --> 17:59.177
There's plenty of water
flowing through it,
and it tastes great.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.412
You want to check out
down here,
a place to set the pots?

18:01.414 --> 18:02.346
Yeah, let's do that.

18:02.348 --> 18:03.915
All right.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.750
<i> [henry] a buddy of mine</i>
<i>  owns the land.</i>

18:05.752 --> 18:08.753
<i>  He gave me permission to go</i>
<i>  in there, check it out.</i>

18:08.755 --> 18:10.988
And, you know,
you've got to be able
to have these people

18:10.990 --> 18:13.291
to trust you to come
onto their property,

18:13.293 --> 18:16.327
<i>  make your liquor,</i>
<i>  not trash your property up.</i>

18:16.329 --> 18:18.563
If not, you're not going
to get your sites.

18:18.565 --> 18:21.299
-What do you think, henry?
-I think it looks good, man.

18:21.301 --> 18:26.170
That waterfall's up there
about a 100 yards, we can
take gravity water.

18:26.172 --> 18:28.272
The best part
about this still site,

18:28.274 --> 18:30.808
<i>  it's on the backside</i>
<i>  of a farm.</i>

18:30.810 --> 18:33.211
Take us four,
I thought maybe here,

18:33.213 --> 18:35.246
right in the middle,
set the thumpers.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.949
Take four more,
stretch them out
a little bit further.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.851
We'll be able to back
right up here to the stills.

18:39.853 --> 18:43.020
It's easy access, in and out.

18:43.022 --> 18:45.289
Nobody's going
to be watching our traffic.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.958
You know
what this site's missing?

18:46.960 --> 18:48.292
-Some pots.
-I hear you, brother.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.161
-Yes, sir.
-Well, get on with it.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.130
Let's get on it.
Let's get on it.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.031
Only one way
we're gonna get it done.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.134
[dramatic music playing]

19:07.147 --> 19:09.614
you know, these guys talk
to the county officers

19:09.616 --> 19:12.016
and the state officers
on a daily basis,

19:12.018 --> 19:15.786
so I'm sure
they've been updated
on our situation.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.455
Oh, I'd almost bet on it.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.957
I'm sure that
our local sheriff's department

19:19.959 --> 19:21.325
knows the same thing now

19:21.327 --> 19:23.227
that our police department
knows.

19:23.229 --> 19:25.129
<i>  They know who we are,</i>
<i>  they know what we drive,</i>

19:25.131 --> 19:26.764
<i>  they know where we live.</i>

19:26.766 --> 19:29.634
So the best thing to do,
we're gonna get
as far as we can

19:29.636 --> 19:31.769
out of cocke county,
I believe.

19:31.771 --> 19:32.770
We got to go far.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.206
But I don't know where to go.

19:35.208 --> 19:38.142
Places have been developed,
houses built,

19:38.144 --> 19:41.312
I wonder if jb
knows any place.

19:41.314 --> 19:44.749
He made liquor at a lot
of places with popcorn.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.250
You wanna ride over
and see him?

19:46.252 --> 19:49.020
I mean, if he don't,
we ain't lost nothing.

19:49.756 --> 19:52.723
Jb, back in the day,
he spent a lot of time

19:52.725 --> 19:56.327
in maggie valley,
north carolina,
back with popcorn.

19:56.329 --> 20:00.965
<i>  They made a lot of liquor</i>
<i>  in that area, and jb</i>
<i>  is very familiar with it.</i>

20:02.168 --> 20:04.835
Jb, I'll tell you what,
he's looking better than

20:04.837 --> 20:06.003
he's done a long time,
ain't he?

20:06.005 --> 20:09.106
I think getting him
new teeth has helped him
out a lot.

20:09.108 --> 20:11.842
What are we gonna do
if he ain't got
nowhere in mind?

20:11.844 --> 20:13.811
Repeat after me.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.546
You want fries with that?

20:18.251 --> 20:19.984
We're gonna learn here
in just a minute

20:19.986 --> 20:23.287
what jb might
or might not know.

20:24.157 --> 20:25.556
[mark] hello there, jb rader!

20:25.558 --> 20:26.924
[jb] hey!

20:26.926 --> 20:27.858
[mark] how you doing, brother?

20:27.860 --> 20:29.794
[jb] I'm doing damn good.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.929
-[mark]
good to see you, brother.
-Yeah, good to see you.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.898
Rader's my name,
liquor's my game.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.400
-Yep.
-You look like
you're feeling awful good.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.002
Best I've felt in years.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.904
-He's a rutting buck.
-[laughs]

20:39.906 --> 20:42.640
[mark] oh, yeah?
That's a good thing
for what we need.

20:42.642 --> 20:45.876
Yep. We're... We're...
We're kind of up
a stump, jb.

20:45.878 --> 20:49.080
-Are you?
-We got paid a visit
by the chief of police.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.048
-Oh, hell.
-He put us on the road.

20:51.050 --> 20:53.150
We need a new still site.

20:53.152 --> 20:56.153
We know you spent a lot
of time on the other side
of the mountain over yonder.

20:56.155 --> 20:59.323
Oh, yeah.
I know the other side
of the mountain real good.

20:59.325 --> 21:03.060
We made a lot of runs up
and down the mountain,
but it's been so long.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.129
I'm hoping
you still got it fresh
in your noggin.

21:05.131 --> 21:08.299
Not too fresh, but I think
I can come up with it.

21:08.301 --> 21:09.967
-You got anything to do?
-Nah.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.335
Can you go with us
to scout a few places?

21:11.337 --> 21:13.604
-Oh, yeah.
-Let's go do,
let's go do a little scout.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.072
All right.
Let's do it.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.475
[mark] we might even buy you
a hotdog while we're out.

21:18.111 --> 21:20.344
[laid-back music playing]

21:27.053 --> 21:29.153
-[mike] we lost
150 gallons of good liquor.
-[jerry] I know.

21:29.155 --> 21:32.156
[mike] we can't afford
to lose our still
and everything else too.

21:33.026 --> 21:35.326
But the damn law,
they're like a blue tick hound

21:35.328 --> 21:37.128
they'll lay up
and wait on you, boy.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.530
You see the dirt road going,
you see any tracks in it?

21:41.768 --> 21:44.135
It's all growed up.

21:44.137 --> 21:47.305
One good thing, I can hear
the damn birds
are chirping around.

21:47.307 --> 21:51.142
You know, if you see
some animals down
and close...

21:52.011 --> 21:53.844
There ain't nobody down there.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.813
Let's get the truck,
get in here
and get this out of here

21:55.815 --> 21:57.615
and get done with it.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.116
[mike]
<i>  going back to the still site,</i>

21:59.118 --> 22:00.885
I mean, I'm as nervous
as a damn cat

22:00.887 --> 22:02.653
in a room
full of rocking chairs.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.121
<i>  Because it's like</i>
<i>  a crime scene.</i>

22:04.123 --> 22:06.023
<i>  You go back to that bastard,</i>

22:06.025 --> 22:08.426
that's when 90%
of the time you get caught.

22:12.198 --> 22:14.298
Let's just go for it.

22:14.300 --> 22:19.370
Let's just get the damn
pot, the tanks and the stuff
that we need to use right now.

22:20.406 --> 22:22.039
We got to get
the hell out of here.

22:22.041 --> 22:26.477
We need to get and go
and be done with it.
Come on.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.579
We're happy to see
that nobody's been here.

22:28.581 --> 22:30.381
<i>  It looks safe.</i>

22:30.383 --> 22:33.751
But me and mike don't feel
safe right now, so we're going
to just pack up and move on.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.786
[jerry grunts]

22:35.788 --> 22:38.789
I don't feel real comfortable
about brewing liquor
in this area right now.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.624
<i>  We know that somebody</i>
<i>  has ratted us out</i>

22:40.626 --> 22:44.028
<i>  and we know that</i>
<i>  the cops have been</i>
<i>  to our stash house.</i>

22:44.030 --> 22:46.997
To me, that's just too
much heat in one area
to be hanging around.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.133
I see nobody.

22:49.736 --> 22:50.901
Huh!

22:52.472 --> 22:54.839
I'm gonna make liquor,
but I don't know
where to do it at

22:54.841 --> 22:56.207
at this present time.

22:56.209 --> 22:59.710
Well, you may not be too keen
on it, but I got an idea.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.345
I think we should go
over the mountain,

23:01.347 --> 23:03.614
get closer back to my hometown
in north carolina.

23:05.351 --> 23:07.218
I don't know a damn soul
over there.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.553
That ain't my territory
over there.

23:09.555 --> 23:12.123
You know,
sevier county in tennessee,
this is home to me.

23:12.125 --> 23:14.625
This is where
we make the liquor.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.594
I'm used to everything
and everybody around.

23:16.596 --> 23:17.862
[sighs]

23:17.864 --> 23:21.198
but there's a good possibility
the law knows exactly
who I am

23:21.200 --> 23:23.234
<i>  and I really don't think</i>
<i>  it'll be a smart move</i>

23:23.236 --> 23:25.403
to start our season off
right here

23:25.405 --> 23:28.072
where we've been or even
in the same damn county.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.341
You know, we've got to keep
our operation going,

23:30.343 --> 23:32.109
that's for damn sure,
but, I mean...

23:32.111 --> 23:35.045
I've got good contacts
over there.

23:35.047 --> 23:38.883
-I don't know, man.
-Good sources of people
we can rely on.

23:38.885 --> 23:41.819
But we ain't got
a hell of a lot of damn
more choices, do we?

23:41.821 --> 23:43.921
If you know the contacts
and you know

23:43.923 --> 23:45.423
people to get hold of

23:45.425 --> 23:48.025
and that another, I mean,
hell, why not?

23:48.027 --> 23:49.059
I'll do it.

23:49.061 --> 23:50.995
You know, jerry being
from north carolina,

23:50.997 --> 23:52.329
<i>  you know, he knows</i>
<i>  those woods over there</i>

23:52.331 --> 23:54.365
<i>  as good as I know</i>
<i>  these over here.</i>

23:54.367 --> 23:56.200
Maybe we can be
out of harm's way.

23:56.202 --> 23:58.436
But I can tell you this,
we're not carrying the stills

23:58.438 --> 23:59.837
we've got over here
across that damn mountain,

23:59.839 --> 24:02.373
'cause when you go
across the state lines,
it becomes federal.

24:02.375 --> 24:05.443
We'll go to north carolina,
but we've got to start
from the ground up, brother.

24:05.445 --> 24:07.044
-[jerry] oh, yeah.
-[mike] get set up,

24:07.046 --> 24:08.446
be good. Who knows?

24:16.155 --> 24:18.255
[laid-back music playing]

24:26.032 --> 24:27.131
did you fart?

24:29.602 --> 24:31.502
God almighty, son!

24:31.504 --> 24:33.437
[brian laughs]

24:33.439 --> 24:35.706
you [bleep].

24:35.708 --> 24:37.475
[bleep] damn.

24:38.311 --> 24:41.011
<i>  I told henry I would get</i>
<i>  some strawberries,</i>

24:41.013 --> 24:44.081
but I've called all around
from here to timbuktu,

24:44.083 --> 24:46.817
<i>  and I kind of missed</i>
<i>  the boat on it.</i>

24:46.819 --> 24:49.620
<i>  Colt called and says</i>
<i>  he feels bad</i>
<i>  about the strawberries,</i>

24:49.622 --> 24:51.956
<i>  but he's got lots</i>
<i>  of other stuff</i>
<i>  we might can use.</i>

24:51.958 --> 24:54.358
He ain't gonna be here,
so he just told us
to run in,

24:54.360 --> 24:57.628
get the forklift,
run to the cooler,
get it out and rock and roll.

24:57.630 --> 24:58.796
That's easy enough.

24:58.798 --> 25:00.130
[josh]
<i>  henry, kenny and tickle,</i>

25:00.132 --> 25:01.799
<i>  they're moving the eight</i>
<i>  submarine pots,</i>

25:01.801 --> 25:03.033
<i>  getting them all set up,</i>

25:03.035 --> 25:06.003
and we're gonna make lots
of brandy and stuff.

25:06.005 --> 25:10.374
<i>  And with that being</i>
<i>  said, it's gonna take</i>
<i>  massive amounts of fruit.</i>

25:10.376 --> 25:11.976
All right.

25:12.445 --> 25:14.278
There is the forklift there.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.047
Come in here.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.753
Heck yeah.

25:22.755 --> 25:24.622
-[brian] it's nice.
-Look at all that.

25:24.624 --> 25:26.323
<i>  My dad used</i>
<i>  to make this recipe,</i>

25:26.325 --> 25:29.960
the true watermelon brandy
without using any sugar,

25:29.962 --> 25:31.228
you know,
just using the fruit.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.897
[brian] them babies are ripe.

25:32.899 --> 25:34.832
<i> [josh] so now that</i>
<i>  we've got some watermelons,</i>

25:34.834 --> 25:37.001
I'm really wanting
to make this really high-end,

25:37.003 --> 25:38.235
frickin' really good brandy.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.370
[brian] that's awesome.

25:39.372 --> 25:41.205
What's in the edibles barrel?

25:42.608 --> 25:44.608
[josh] that one says
"non-edible."

25:44.610 --> 25:46.210
[brian] oh.

25:46.212 --> 25:49.413
[josh] it ain't pineapples,
but it's the cores
and they just...

25:49.415 --> 25:51.949
All they do is core 'em
out and frickin'...

25:53.386 --> 25:54.385
Is it sweet?

25:54.387 --> 25:56.020
-Yeah, pretty good.
-Really?

25:56.022 --> 25:57.621
That'll make
good moonshine then.

25:57.623 --> 25:58.722
How are we gonna use this?

25:58.724 --> 25:59.890
There's not even much meat
on there.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.760
I know,
but there's still sugar
in that right there.

26:02.762 --> 26:05.796
I haven't really heard about
a whole lot of other people
doing pineapples,

26:05.798 --> 26:08.732
<i>  so I don't even know how</i>
<i>  that's gonna turn out.</i>

26:08.734 --> 26:11.936
But it's important to me
to do things that other people
aren't really doing.

26:11.938 --> 26:13.871
You want to load
the pineapples first,

26:13.873 --> 26:15.272
so we can put them
on the back of the truck?

26:15.274 --> 26:17.975
Yeah, you may have to ride
on that pallet
and hold that barrel

26:17.977 --> 26:19.009
while we get out of here.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.010
Why, you're going
to drive that fast?

26:20.012 --> 26:21.378
Well, I might.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.213
You ain't gonna be breaking
the sound barrier, are you?

26:23.215 --> 26:25.616
[engine starts]

26:25.618 --> 26:27.952
we hit the mother lode
on these watermelons.

26:27.954 --> 26:31.021
<i>  We got a lot of fruit,</i>
<i>  and one thing's for sure,</i>

26:31.023 --> 26:32.189
<i>  I'm gonna have to come up</i>
<i>  with a way</i>

26:32.191 --> 26:35.859
to turn all this fruit
into pulp.

26:35.861 --> 26:38.095
[brian] I'm gonna go
get the watermelons,
I'll be back.

26:38.097 --> 26:41.365
So I'm thinking about,
just like a beer-can crusher,
you know,

26:41.367 --> 26:44.535
but like a beer-can
crusher for fruit.

26:46.272 --> 26:49.006
Oh, man,
watermelon goodness
right there,

26:49.008 --> 26:50.507
that's gonna make some
good moonshine.

26:50.509 --> 26:52.610
[laid-black music playing]

27:00.753 --> 27:03.020
it's time you take
these little babies
out of here.

27:03.022 --> 27:05.055
-[tickle] that's right.
-It's time to be
getting 'em moved.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.191
<i> [tickle] now that we</i>
<i>  got our still site,</i>

27:07.193 --> 27:09.627
we've got to move out
of this still site

27:09.629 --> 27:11.962
that we had these eight pots
in over the winter.

27:11.964 --> 27:12.997
All right.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.231
<i>  Josh, well,</i>

27:14.233 --> 27:17.001
he's coming with a bunch
of strawberries to mash in

27:17.003 --> 27:19.603
and we need to be ready
when he gets here.

27:19.605 --> 27:21.105

27:21.107 --> 27:22.339
hell!

27:22.341 --> 27:24.508
She cranks up,
that's half the battle.

27:25.611 --> 27:27.778
<i>  We've got</i>
<i>  all these stills busted down</i>

27:27.780 --> 27:30.547
and in about an hour,
it's gonna be dark.

-There you go.
-That's good there.

27:34.186 --> 27:36.020
[tickle] I see you, big boy.

27:36.055 --> 27:37.721
It's there!

27:37.723 --> 27:43.293
We'd be fools to run out
on the road with these stills
when it was daytime.

27:43.295 --> 27:47.231
<i>  So, once the night comes,</i>
<i>  we're gonna start</i>
<i>  heading down the road</i>

27:47.233 --> 27:51.035
and I'm willing to bet
this is gonna take
all night.

27:51.037 --> 27:53.971
[henry] I think what we need
to do is get moving
before it gets dark.

27:53.973 --> 27:56.573
<i> [tickle] we've got</i>
<i>  our first two pots loaded up.</i>

27:56.575 --> 27:58.208
<i>  We're gonna have to do this</i>
<i>  in shifts.</i>

27:58.210 --> 28:02.012
We don't have a semi-truck
like josh brought
these things over in,

28:02.014 --> 28:05.282
<i>  so we're just going</i>
<i>  to take them over</i>
<i>  a couple at a time.</i>

28:05.284 --> 28:07.951
It's gonna take
several trips to get them all,

28:07.953 --> 28:10.254
<i>  but being dark like this,</i>

28:10.256 --> 28:13.824
<i>  we'll get these things</i>
<i>  over here</i>
<i>  and won't have any problems.</i>

28:13.826 --> 28:16.126
[henry] well, I reckon
it's a good place as any.

28:16.128 --> 28:19.196
All right. That's one.

28:19.198 --> 28:25.002
These 800-gallon pots,
I mean,
these things are heavy.

28:25.004 --> 28:29.039
<i>  They're built like a tank</i>
<i>  and they weigh just as much.</i>

28:29.041 --> 28:32.009
But luckily,
we got experience on our side.

28:32.011 --> 28:34.111
We know
how to move these things.

28:34.113 --> 28:35.646
Let's go and grab two more.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.882
[josh] damn,
why don't you just get...

28:38.884 --> 28:40.184
Get in your lane, dude!

28:40.186 --> 28:41.385
Damn!

28:41.387 --> 28:43.020
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa!

28:43.022 --> 28:45.956
[mark] man, this is damn
hallowed ground.

28:45.958 --> 28:48.592
I'm still seeing some
gun dancing right there.

28:49.729 --> 28:53.464
If there's a holy grail
of moonshine,
it's right here.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.067
[josh] if we're gonna make
brandies and stuff,

28:57.069 --> 28:58.202
it'd be great to have like

28:58.204 --> 29:02.072
a ginormous beer-can crusher
to mash up all this fruit.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.041
I've never thought about that.
It'll probably work.

29:04.043 --> 29:06.210
[josh] but we're gonna go
over here to my buddy tooth

29:06.212 --> 29:07.778
and we're gonna get
some metal and stuff.

29:07.780 --> 29:09.613
He can fabricate anything.

29:12.785 --> 29:15.352
If we can't find
what we need here,
there's something wrong.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.988
Hey, what's up, fellas,
what's going on?

29:18.791 --> 29:20.124
What y'all into?

29:20.292 --> 29:23.193
Man, we're working
on a crazy-ass project
and we need some help.

29:23.195 --> 29:24.394
Think you can help us out?

29:24.396 --> 29:25.562
I'll see what I can do.

29:26.832 --> 29:27.798
All right, tooth.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.833
Now, I ain't no artist.

29:29.835 --> 29:32.803
I can't sing
and I can't dance.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.838
But let's just say
that somewhere in here,

29:34.840 --> 29:37.074
I want a piece of metal
that stays there all the time,

29:37.076 --> 29:40.210
and then I want
some kind of handle
that comes down to a plate.

29:40.212 --> 29:43.013
And so when you move
this handle up and down,

29:43.015 --> 29:46.016
it smashes this piece of metal
against this piece of metal

29:46.018 --> 29:48.652
and then I want some sort of
way to capture the juice.

29:48.654 --> 29:50.921
And that's the basic idea.

29:50.923 --> 29:51.855
[tooth] okay.

29:51.857 --> 29:53.357
I think we can come up
with what you want.

29:53.359 --> 29:56.260
-Show me what you got.
-[tooth] so here's a piece
of plate that might work.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.228
That's perfect right there.
You got two of them?

29:58.230 --> 30:00.764
-I got two of these, for sure.
-Perfect.

30:00.766 --> 30:03.033
Look here, josh.
Catch everything coming
out at the bottom.

30:03.035 --> 30:04.034
[josh] that's good.
That's good.

30:04.036 --> 30:05.235
That'll work perfect.

30:05.237 --> 30:07.304
[tooth] so, I have a piece
of stainless pot,

30:07.306 --> 30:08.872
might be about
three foot you can have.

30:08.874 --> 30:10.307
What's something
like this cost?

30:10.309 --> 30:13.911
You're looking
at about $1,100, $1,200
for what you need.

30:13.913 --> 30:15.813
[josh] just for two
or three foot?

30:15.815 --> 30:17.614
-[tooth] yeah.
-[josh] I can't afford that.

30:17.616 --> 30:19.116
[tooth] I'll tell you what.

30:19.118 --> 30:21.418
I'll hook you up
if you hook me up
when you get the product done.

30:21.420 --> 30:22.619
How about that?

30:22.621 --> 30:24.388
Hell yeah. Perfect.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.123
[tooth] let's get
you boys loaded up.

30:26.125 --> 30:27.357
Tooth has all the right stuff.

30:27.359 --> 30:28.625
Heck yeah, man.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.093
I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

30:30.095 --> 30:31.962
[tooth] I'm just glad.
I can help you out.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.163
[josh]
oh, you done hooked me up.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.464
We came to the right place.

30:34.466 --> 30:35.899
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

30:35.901 --> 30:37.034
One, two, three, go.

30:40.906 --> 30:42.339
All right.

30:42.641 --> 30:44.775
Well, now that we got
all our supplies, we need
to be going to virginia.

30:44.777 --> 30:46.710
I owe you one, brother.

30:46.712 --> 30:49.746
I'm really nervous showing up
with these watermelons
instead of the strawberries.

30:49.748 --> 30:52.316
<i>  They're totally expecting</i>
<i>  strawberries.</i>

30:52.318 --> 30:54.651
<i> We got a really good operation</i>
<i>  going right now,</i>

30:54.653 --> 30:57.421
<i>  and the last thing I want</i>
<i>  to do is screw that up</i>
<i>  in any way.</i>

30:58.290 --> 31:00.324
[instrumental music playing]

31:06.999 --> 31:08.432
[henry] what do you think?

31:08.968 --> 31:10.801
[tickle] what do you reckon,
kenny, all the way back
here to the back?

31:10.803 --> 31:11.702
[kenny] all the way back.

31:11.704 --> 31:14.271
We've got a huge task
in front of us.

31:14.273 --> 31:17.774
<i> Josh, he's coming with a bunch</i>
<i>  of strawberries</i>
<i>  for us to mash in</i>

31:17.776 --> 31:20.878
<i>  and we need to be ready</i>
<i>  when he gets here.</i>

31:20.880 --> 31:22.813
<i>  We've got to set</i>
<i>  eight pots today,</i>

31:22.815 --> 31:27.050
get all these blocks built up
that our stills
will actually sit on.

31:27.052 --> 31:30.220
[henry] I'll tell you what,
me and kenny first met
tickle right here.

31:30.222 --> 31:34.892
We had in our mind that
he was lazy, especially just
getting out of penitentiary.

31:34.894 --> 31:36.326
We were dead wrong.

31:36.328 --> 31:39.196
He's about as hard a worker
as you ever want one
in your life.

31:39.198 --> 31:41.431
We take pride in what we do.

31:41.433 --> 31:43.867
<i>  You can't just bring</i>
<i>  eight pots in here</i>

31:43.869 --> 31:46.737
<i>  and just throw 'em up any way</i>
<i>  you want to.</i>

31:46.739 --> 31:50.007
These still sites,
they need to be straight
in line with each other.

31:50.009 --> 31:51.909
<i>  They need to be level</i>
<i>  with each other.</i>

31:51.911 --> 31:54.945
The stills got a 2.5 inch
piece of wood for the sides.

31:54.947 --> 31:56.713
If you move it over too far,

31:56.715 --> 31:58.815
this damn block
will start pushing up

31:58.817 --> 32:01.451
against that metal
and it'll warp that metal.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.020
[kenny]
that should roll well, mate.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.154
[henry] looks good, too.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.156
[kenny] real good.

32:06.158 --> 32:10.093
<i> [tickle] you know,</i>
<i>  this still site is absolutely</i>
<i>  beautiful to me.</i>

32:10.095 --> 32:11.995
There's more pots right here

32:11.997 --> 32:15.632
than most moonshiners
could ever hope to cook
through in their life.

32:17.169 --> 32:19.002
Way back in the day,

32:19.004 --> 32:21.238
people were putting
these still sites up

32:21.240 --> 32:23.507
even bigger than this.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.009
<i>  That's what made it</i>
<i>  franklin county,</i>

32:26.011 --> 32:28.345
<i>  the moonshine capital</i>
<i>  of the world.</i>

32:28.347 --> 32:30.414
<i>  And I'll tell you what,</i>
<i>  this thing,</i>

32:30.416 --> 32:32.349
<i>  it's not only gonna</i>
<i>  pump out moonshine,</i>

32:32.351 --> 32:34.051
it's gonna pump out money.

32:34.053 --> 32:35.352
You know
what we need now, right?

32:35.354 --> 32:37.254
-Yeah.
-You gotta have some water.

32:37.256 --> 32:39.256
We can't do nothing else
till we get 'em.

32:39.258 --> 32:42.426
<i>  It's time for the next part</i>
<i>  of our operation.</i>

32:42.428 --> 32:43.593
If we don't get water,

32:43.595 --> 32:45.262
we ain't gonna have nothing.

32:46.298 --> 32:49.032
-This stuff gets wet,
it gets heavy.
-[henry] yeah, it's heavy.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.802
We're gonna be using
gravity water.

32:51.804 --> 32:55.772
<i>  When you find water</i>
<i>  and it's uphill</i>
<i>  from your still site,</i>

32:55.774 --> 32:57.841
<i>  what that does is,</i>
<i>  it takes the weight</i>

32:57.843 --> 33:01.912
<i>  and the volume of that water</i>
<i>  and transfers it to power.</i>

33:01.914 --> 33:04.181
It's just gonna be
real silent.

33:04.183 --> 33:07.384
We won't have no noisy pump
giving our location away.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.386
Oh, yeah.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.355
Now she's got some force
behind her.

33:12.057 --> 33:13.390
Okay.

33:13.392 --> 33:14.992
Hook another line
to the end of that

33:14.994 --> 33:16.360
and we keep on getting it.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.898
I never had to worry
about a pump.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.934
Never had to worry
about gasoline.

33:24.203 --> 33:25.836
Gravity water, brother.

33:25.838 --> 33:30.741
Well, we finally got
everything set up that
we need in our still site

33:30.743 --> 33:32.843
<i>  and we got it before</i>
<i>  josh got here.</i>

33:32.845 --> 33:35.979
<i>  He should be pulling around</i>
<i>  any darn time.</i>

33:35.981 --> 33:38.115
<i> This truckload of strawberries</i>
<i>  he's bringing us,</i>

33:38.117 --> 33:39.316
<i>  can't wait.</i>

33:39.318 --> 33:41.385
[instrumental music playing]

33:51.930 --> 33:53.296
[josh] I'm on my way
to virginia.

33:53.298 --> 33:56.967
Last time we were here,
we were making
grain moonshine.

33:56.969 --> 33:59.102
I made all these stills
for making brandies,

33:59.104 --> 34:02.272
and all we got to do
was run grain
till the end of the year.

34:02.274 --> 34:04.174
I'm really looking forward
to getting back up there,

34:04.176 --> 34:06.877
where I could get
those stills rolling again

34:06.879 --> 34:09.813
and start cooking down
some of this fruit.

34:09.815 --> 34:13.350
You know, brian could be
my right-hand man
when I'm in town,

34:13.352 --> 34:15.619
but most of my work
is gonna be in virginia

34:15.621 --> 34:17.921
<i>  and he's gonna be</i>
<i>  coming back and forth.</i>

34:17.923 --> 34:20.357
He's got a good grading job
that he just can't let go.

34:21.894 --> 34:23.193
I know henry,
kenny and tickle,

34:23.195 --> 34:25.529
they're expecting
strawberries.

34:25.531 --> 34:27.831
I might not have a darn
trailer load of strawberries,

34:27.833 --> 34:29.900
but I got a trailer load
of watermelons.

34:29.902 --> 34:34.137
Hopefully, these guys will go
for it when I get here.

34:34.139 --> 34:36.940
I got a plan to make
some watermelon moonshine,

34:36.942 --> 34:38.842
we're gonna call it
green lizard.

34:38.844 --> 34:43.880
This watermelon moonshine
recipe goes back
hundreds of damn years.

34:43.882 --> 34:46.116
Back then, they didn't have
the sugar to add to it.

34:46.118 --> 34:48.018
They made
some high-end brandy,

34:48.020 --> 34:51.188
they just might not have got
a big yield out of it,
or a big return.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.123
My dad and my buddy tony

34:53.125 --> 34:54.825
used to make this stuff
all the time

34:54.827 --> 34:56.293
and that's how I know
about it.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.862
Super excited
to try this recipe out.

34:58.864 --> 34:59.830
Make something that

34:59.832 --> 35:01.932
these guys
ain't never seen before.

35:01.934 --> 35:05.102
I guarantee you
it'll make you do
the watermelon crawl.

35:06.371 --> 35:07.938
Damn, what's this guy...

35:08.474 --> 35:10.273
Get in your lane, dude!

35:10.275 --> 35:11.408
Damn!

35:11.410 --> 35:14.311
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa! God almighty!

35:15.614 --> 35:17.514
Ah, son of a bitch!

35:18.884 --> 35:20.517
Ah, goddamn!

35:27.292 --> 35:29.759
So you just put that
on there, lock it,

35:29.761 --> 35:33.063
and then you got to wrap
that wire around.

35:33.065 --> 35:35.165
Josh owens,
the moonshiner necklace-maker.

35:35.167 --> 35:38.034
I'm not a necklace-maker, man.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.905
You got enough sea turtles
here to make you
another necklace.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.306
I got that stuff for reese.

35:43.308 --> 35:46.009
Oh, no, I think I might have
to call reese after a while

35:46.011 --> 35:47.944
and ask her
if she likes sea turtles

35:47.946 --> 35:49.479
or does dad like sea turtles?

35:49.481 --> 35:51.047
[laughs]

35:51.049 --> 35:53.216
and I'm pretty sure I know
what she's gonna say.

35:53.218 --> 35:55.118
-[josh] oh, yeah.
-"those are dad's."

35:55.120 --> 35:56.186
[josh] "yeah,
those are dad's."

35:56.188 --> 35:58.021
I'm all about it. I love it.

35:58.023 --> 35:59.956
[brian] oh, it's so beautiful.
Put it on. Let me see.

35:59.958 --> 36:01.424
Is it a choker?

36:01.426 --> 36:03.927
You're making
fun of me right now,
that's embarrassing me.

36:03.929 --> 36:04.961
Seriously.

36:04.963 --> 36:07.030
-[laughs]
-I will kill y'all.

36:07.032 --> 36:08.498
That's gonna look great.

36:09.635 --> 36:11.301
[josh] damn,
why don't you just get...

36:11.303 --> 36:12.969
Get in your lane, dude!

36:12.971 --> 36:14.204
Damn!

36:15.307 --> 36:19.409
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa! God almighty!

36:21.346 --> 36:23.613
Ah, goddamn!

36:26.084 --> 36:28.385
Son of a bitch, burn it down!

36:29.454 --> 36:30.987
This is a mess.

36:32.457 --> 36:34.524
Damn, we lost pineapple too.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.993
<i>  I'm on the road</i>

36:36.995 --> 36:38.695
and all of a sudden
this van just damn

36:38.697 --> 36:40.163
starts coming over
into my lane.

36:40.165 --> 36:42.098
<i>  Think this guy</i>
<i>  was on the phone</i>
<i>  or something,</i>

36:42.100 --> 36:45.202
<i>  I'm not really sure,</i>
<i>  but if I hadn't been</i>
<i>  paying attention,</i>

36:45.204 --> 36:46.836
it'd have been
a head-on collision

36:46.838 --> 36:48.605
and the watermelons
wouldn't have mattered.

36:48.607 --> 36:51.308
<i>  Thankfully, only a few</i>
<i>  of the watermelons busted.</i>

36:51.310 --> 36:54.311
<i>  I frickin' damn salvaged</i>
<i>  what I could</i>
<i>  of the watermelons,</i>

36:54.313 --> 36:56.980
<i>  pushed the boxes up</i>
<i>  on the trailer.</i>

36:56.982 --> 36:59.816
What the hell is that
stuck on?

36:59.818 --> 37:00.917
[grunts wearily]

37:00.919 --> 37:03.220
now what am I going
to do about this?

37:03.222 --> 37:04.287
It's split right apart.

37:04.289 --> 37:06.156
They're not supposed
to do that.

37:07.259 --> 37:09.092
Maybe there's some tape
in the truck.

37:09.094 --> 37:10.660
[breathes heavily]

37:13.098 --> 37:14.364
ah!

37:16.868 --> 37:20.203
Ninety-mile-an-hour high-speed
duct tape right there, buddy.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.906
One thing's for sure.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.574
My name's
not good luck chuck.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.910
Never in a million years

37:26.912 --> 37:28.979
would I have thought I'd have
to strap those things down.

37:28.981 --> 37:31.915
When things go right,
it's almost odd.

37:31.917 --> 37:35.785
<i> I really started noticing this</i>
<i>  about the time</i>
<i>  I cut my fingers off.</i>

37:35.787 --> 37:38.121
Every time I started to feel
like I'm hitting a home run,

37:38.123 --> 37:40.156
I needed to go get
in a bulletproof room

37:40.158 --> 37:42.592
or something because
[bleep] about to hit the fan.

37:45.097 --> 37:47.364
[exhales sharply]
golly, look at that.

37:47.366 --> 37:49.199
I can't believe
that it took these things

37:49.201 --> 37:51.568
busting all over the highway
for me to taste one.

37:54.206 --> 37:56.072
God, that is sweet!

37:56.074 --> 37:58.642
That is the best watermelon
I've had in years.

37:58.644 --> 38:00.143
That'll taste almost the same

38:00.145 --> 38:02.912
when we turn it into whiskey.
And juicy, look at that.

38:02.914 --> 38:04.247
Yeah!

38:04.249 --> 38:06.383
That is gonna make
some good whiskey.

38:07.152 --> 38:09.185
But now, we're gonna
go to virginia.

38:10.022 --> 38:12.022
[instrumental music playing]

38:20.132 --> 38:22.165
damn, it'd be awful
to go to penitentiary

38:22.167 --> 38:24.000
this late
in our lives, wouldn't it?

38:24.002 --> 38:24.901
Oh, hell, yeah.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.136
Oh, I'm way too purdy.

38:26.138 --> 38:28.338
-You're way too purdy, digger.
-[laughs]

38:28.340 --> 38:29.973
I'll become
a victim immediately.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.207
Oh, yeah.

38:31.209 --> 38:33.610
You know, after our little
visit from the police,

38:33.612 --> 38:36.046
our plan is to go
across the state lines,

38:36.048 --> 38:39.249
go across the mountain,
get over in there
somewhere in north carolina.

38:39.251 --> 38:42.786
You know, popcorn had
a lot of haunts over there
that he frequented,

38:42.788 --> 38:45.121
<i>  and jb claims</i>
<i>  that he remembers</i>

38:45.123 --> 38:46.790
<i>  where we need to go</i>
<i>  over there.</i>

38:46.792 --> 38:49.626
It's starting to get less
and less populated, ain't it?

38:49.628 --> 38:52.429
-Oh, yeah.
<i> -[digger] we'll let him</i>
<i>  lead the way, I'll pilot,</i>

38:52.431 --> 38:54.964
he'll navigate and we'll see
if we can't get there.

38:54.966 --> 38:57.701
There's the last
line on electric here.

38:57.703 --> 39:00.170
-Yeah.
-That pole right
there deadens it.

39:00.172 --> 39:02.138
From here on out,
there ain't no electricity.

39:02.140 --> 39:04.207
-[jb] yeah.
-I like that idea.

39:04.209 --> 39:05.408
Oh, yeah.

39:07.079 --> 39:09.045
-[mark] damn, jb.
-[jb] yeah.

39:09.047 --> 39:11.247
We get a flat tire
or broke down back in here,

39:11.249 --> 39:13.383
we'll have to walk
47 miles to get out.

39:13.385 --> 39:15.385
[jb speaking]

39:15.387 --> 39:18.188
[digger] I don't want
to get over here close
to the edge and look off.

39:18.190 --> 39:19.322
Hell no.

39:19.324 --> 39:21.024
[jb speaking]

39:33.872 --> 39:35.372
-[mark] jb?
-[jb] yeah.

39:35.374 --> 39:37.240
[mark] where the hell
are you going
with this goat trail?

39:37.242 --> 39:38.975
[jb speaking]

39:40.846 --> 39:42.078
[mark]
there's one thing about it,

39:42.080 --> 39:43.613
if we do end up here,

39:43.615 --> 39:45.615
there ain't nobody going
to bother.

39:45.617 --> 39:48.385
Normally,
we feel more safe at home,

39:48.387 --> 39:50.620
<i>  but right now,</i>
<i>  we're under the microscope.</i>

39:50.622 --> 39:53.189
And under these circumstances,

39:53.191 --> 39:54.357
I'm gonna feel a little better

39:54.359 --> 39:56.359
<i>  up in the mountains</i>
<i>  in north carolina.</i>

39:56.361 --> 39:58.962
[mark] you know
where we're going
or are you guessing?

39:58.964 --> 40:00.630
I know where I'm going.

40:00.632 --> 40:03.032
Well, it gets
a little better now.

40:04.136 --> 40:05.735
[digger] it's hard to tell
at this point

40:05.737 --> 40:08.638
whether jb's covering
for his lack of remembrance

40:08.640 --> 40:10.640
or does he have something
up his sleeve.

40:11.743 --> 40:13.476
Well, I will be damned.

40:13.478 --> 40:17.180
[mark] are you teasing me?
I swear cold chills
just run all over me, jb.

40:17.182 --> 40:18.948
[laughs]

40:18.950 --> 40:21.084
[jb] I'm taking you
to the shrine, boys.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.019
[mark] oh, my gosh.

40:23.021 --> 40:27.123
This is where you
and popcorn sutton
made his last brandy.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.626
[digger] ain't that something.

40:29.628 --> 40:32.962
I never thought
we'd be up here thinking
about making liquor.

40:32.964 --> 40:35.198
[mark] jb rader.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.967
Man, this is damn
hallowed ground.

40:37.969 --> 40:40.637
I still see sutton
dancing up there.

40:43.008 --> 40:47.143
If there's a holy grail
of moonshine, it's right here.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.980
<i> [narrator] next time</i>
<i>  on moonshiners...</i>

40:50.982 --> 40:53.049
[mike] way up
on the mountain up there.

40:53.051 --> 40:55.185
<i>  We just crossed over</i>
<i>  into north carolina.</i>

40:55.187 --> 40:57.120
We've got to build
something new.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.991
Oh! Oh, god!

41:01.993 --> 41:03.993
You're gonna do
what I'm doing,
for a while there

41:03.995 --> 41:06.095
it reminds you of being
a teenager again.

41:06.097 --> 41:09.966
The recipe that jb wants
is all corn and no sugar.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.167
Get that worked in.

41:11.169 --> 41:12.202
This is insane.

41:12.204 --> 41:14.237
No, it's science!

41:14.239 --> 41:18.141
That's the biggest damn
green strawberry I've ever
seen in my life, josh.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.844
This is only gonna make
one still full of mash.

41:20.846 --> 41:24.314
<i>  So what we're gonna do</i>
<i>  is go back down to one</i>
<i>  of our old still sites</i>

41:24.316 --> 41:25.949
and we're gonna run this
green lizard there.

41:25.951 --> 41:27.217
It won't be long.

41:27.219 --> 41:29.118
[indistinct shouting]
