00:01.080 --> 00:05.170
Gary:
Jon was my best friend.

00:05.170 --> 00:07.670
I mean,
he brought us all together.

00:08.880 --> 00:11.380
He helped me through cancer,

00:11.380 --> 00:13.040
he guided our careers...

00:13.040 --> 00:14.580
Action!

00:14.580 --> 00:16.500
...and he showed us
how to live.

00:17.710 --> 00:20.420
And then...

00:20.420 --> 00:21.960
No!

00:21.960 --> 00:23.250
...he was gone.

00:25.710 --> 00:27.880
His loss made us question
everything.

00:29.880 --> 00:32.080
It also made us stronger
than before.

00:33.460 --> 00:38.040
But now
the biggest question is,

00:38.040 --> 00:40.250
did we ever really know Jon
at all?

00:43.080 --> 00:45.620
How much does he owe?
$18 million.

00:45.620 --> 00:48.380
And it's what you owe.

00:48.380 --> 00:49.960
Gary: The Jon that I knew --
the Jon that we all knew --

00:49.960 --> 00:51.380
Stop defending him!

00:51.380 --> 00:53.880
-We need to talk.
-No, Ashley, we don't.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.250
I'm not the man
everyone thinks I am.

01:11.080 --> 01:14.580
Let me just start
by saying I'm sorry.

01:14.580 --> 01:17.580
Uh...

01:19.000 --> 01:20.620
I abandoned you.

01:23.120 --> 01:25.460
I know for a long time
I've owed you some answers.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.120
Um...

01:29.830 --> 01:32.080
But I realize,
as I'm doing this, that I --

01:32.080 --> 01:33.830
there -- there's probably
nothing I can say

01:33.830 --> 01:36.250
that can make this make sense.

01:36.250 --> 01:37.790
Uh...

01:37.790 --> 01:41.250
Except just...

01:41.250 --> 01:44.250

He had me sign things
all the time,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.460
but I never questioned it.
Why hide this?

02:20.460 --> 02:22.040

my breath.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.710
Hey, maybe you shouldn't do
the 5K tomorrow.

02:53.710 --> 02:56.170
I-I signed you up before
I even knew you were pregnant.

02:56.170 --> 02:57.500
Miss your race?
No way.

02:57.500 --> 02:58.710
Are you sure you're okay?

02:58.710 --> 03:00.330
You've been acting
really weird lately.

03:00.330 --> 03:02.000
I'm fine.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.580
Go ahead,
I'll catch up with you.

I cannot believe you are just

03:18.880 --> 03:20.040
You said you didn't want one.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.460
I didn't say I didn't
want one.

03:21.460 --> 03:23.250
I said
I can't have one

03:23.250 --> 03:25.120
because my taste buds
are shot

03:25.120 --> 03:27.710
because of chemo
because of you.

03:27.710 --> 03:29.250
So, just to recap,
you're mad at me because

03:29.250 --> 03:30.790
I convinced you to live?

03:30.790 --> 03:32.750
I am mad because
I can't have that doughnut.

03:32.750 --> 03:34.420
Because of you.

03:34.420 --> 03:36.210
You know,
I didn't give you cancer.

03:36.210 --> 03:38.290
We don't know that for sure.

03:38.290 --> 03:40.120
I like the new kicks.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.120
Yeah, girl.

03:42.210 --> 03:44.210
I know they make shoes
for trails,

03:44.210 --> 03:46.880
but did they design those
just for linoleum?

03:46.880 --> 03:48.710
No, I'm just breaking them in

03:48.710 --> 03:50.120
before the 5K tomorrow.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.460
I'm gonna help Team Dixon
kick some ass...

03:52.460 --> 03:55.670
for mental health
and suicide prevention.

03:55.670 --> 03:58.080
Okay.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.670
That is very sweet,

03:59.670 --> 04:02.750
but you can't eat a doughnut,
much less run a marathon.

04:02.750 --> 04:03.920
It's not a marathon.

04:03.920 --> 04:05.750
It is 3.1 European miles.

04:05.750 --> 04:06.790
It doesn't matter.

04:06.790 --> 04:09.420
You're already
running a marathon,

04:09.420 --> 04:11.330
and I really, really
need you to win it.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.790
Now, I got to bounce.

04:14.790 --> 04:16.420
I got to go
pick up Delilah.

04:16.420 --> 04:18.170
We're all gonna go meet
at Katherine's office

04:18.170 --> 04:19.620
for moral support.

04:19.620 --> 04:20.920
How's she doing?

04:20.920 --> 04:23.080
The pregnant widow
who might lose her house?

04:23.080 --> 04:24.920
I mean,
she's been better.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.250
Okay, I need you
to do me a favor.

04:26.250 --> 04:28.290
When you're on
your way over there?

04:28.290 --> 04:30.670
Just quickly Google
"moral support."

04:30.670 --> 04:32.120
Oh, okay.
Yeah.

04:34.460 --> 04:37.380
We've got to be
missing something.

04:37.380 --> 04:38.620
The Jon I knew would not

04:38.620 --> 04:41.620
have left his family
like this -- no way.

04:41.620 --> 04:43.120
It doesn't make
any sense.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.120
Nothing about suicide
makes sense.

04:51.790 --> 04:53.000
I'm gonna take this.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Stop.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Bye!

04:57.000 --> 04:58.670
Hey, what's up?

04:58.670 --> 04:59.670
Is Rome with you?

04:59.670 --> 05:00.960
No, why?

05:00.960 --> 05:02.290
Here's not here,
and he didn't leave a note,

05:02.290 --> 05:04.620
and I'm kinda freaking out.

05:04.620 --> 05:06.170
Do they have meds
for the spouses of people

05:06.170 --> 05:07.540
who go off their meds?
I don't like it

05:07.540 --> 05:09.960
any more than you do,
but you can't make

05:09.960 --> 05:12.460
someone go back on their meds
if they don't want to.

05:12.460 --> 05:14.250
Like you can't
make someone do chemo?

05:14.250 --> 05:15.500
Have you been
talking to Gary?

05:16.670 --> 05:18.500
Rome: Hey, hon.
Oh, he just walked in.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.330
I'll call you later.

05:20.330 --> 05:22.670
Babe. You can't just
leave like that.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.500
I left a note
in the bathroom.

05:24.500 --> 05:27.330
Who leaves a note
in the bathroom? Seriously.

05:27.330 --> 05:29.330
Gina, you got to
stop worrying.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.000
I've never felt better.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.830
I'm taking care of myself,
I'm eating healthy,

05:32.830 --> 05:34.750
I just cracked
my six minute mile.

05:34.750 --> 05:37.330
And can we talk
about last night, huh?

05:37.330 --> 05:39.330
'Cause based on the complaints
we're getting

05:39.330 --> 05:41.170
from Mr. Maddox
in unit 3B...

05:42.170 --> 05:43.750
...your boy is back.
Mmm.

05:43.750 --> 05:45.170
I'm very back.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.330
You've got to admit,
there's some advantages

05:46.330 --> 05:47.920
to me being off my meds.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.330
Hey, no.
Go get showered, okay.

05:50.330 --> 05:52.500
We -- We're --
We're running late.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.080
And Katherine has news,
and D wants us there.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.460
I ran home for this?

06:02.920 --> 06:04.710
Theo, seriously.
We have to leave.

06:04.710 --> 06:06.120
I'm ready.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.210
You're not wearing socks
or shoes or pants.

06:08.210 --> 06:10.580
But I have my backpack
and Legos.

06:10.580 --> 06:11.620
Come on. Close that up.

06:11.620 --> 06:13.210
Oh, Dad's calling.
Let's go.

06:13.210 --> 06:15.040
Hi, Dad!

06:15.040 --> 06:16.790
Eddie: Hey, bud!
Theo...put...
your pants on, please.

06:16.790 --> 06:18.540
Oh, man, I miss you.

06:18.540 --> 06:20.380
Two weeks
feels like a lifetime.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.120
Show me the bus!
Is there a TV?

06:22.120 --> 06:24.540
"Is there a TV,"
you ask?

06:24.540 --> 06:26.540
Yes, not only do
we have one TV --

06:26.540 --> 06:30.120
one right there --
we have three, okay?

06:30.120 --> 06:31.960
So this is
where we sleep --

06:31.960 --> 06:33.420
I think I showed you
this last time --

06:33.420 --> 06:36.210
and then there are two more TVs
in the back.

06:36.210 --> 06:37.750
Check this out.
What's that?

06:37.750 --> 06:38.790
That!

06:38.790 --> 06:41.580
That is just Jared being...
a drummer.

06:41.580 --> 06:42.920
Dude, please. Come on.

06:42.920 --> 06:44.580
Jared: He's gotta
learn sometime.

06:44.580 --> 06:46.080
We needed to leave,
like, five minutes ago.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.250
Theo, socks.
Okay.

06:47.250 --> 06:49.250
Hey, Katherine.
Pro-tip --

06:49.250 --> 06:51.920
Uggs do not need
socks or laces.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.750
Pro-tip -- Tell Jared
to use protection.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.750
Whew. Pro-tip?

06:56.750 --> 06:59.420
Don't go in there until
we leave Rhode Island.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.000
We are so late. Okay?
He'll call you later.
Okay.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Bye.
-Bye, Dad!

07:02.000 --> 07:05.420
Bye, bud.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.580
Not judging --

07:14.580 --> 07:15.830
Which means
you're judging...

07:15.830 --> 07:18.290
...but your estranged
husband's ex-mistress?

07:18.290 --> 07:20.290
That's who I gave up
my Saturday for?

07:20.290 --> 07:22.460
You were just gonna spend the
day ghosting people on Grindr.

07:22.460 --> 07:23.880
Oh, well,
now who's judging?

07:23.880 --> 07:26.710
Hey, Ashley.
Hey.

07:26.710 --> 07:28.880
Hey. Were you able to find
anything on Winthrop Holdings?

07:28.880 --> 07:30.880
No. We used shell companies
all the time,

07:30.880 --> 07:32.460
but I've never heard
of that one.

07:32.460 --> 07:34.620
There's Delilah.

07:34.620 --> 07:35.790
Hey, guys.
Hey.

07:35.790 --> 07:38.380
Hey. Hi.
Hi.

07:38.380 --> 07:42.210
Okay,
so...how bad is it?

07:42.210 --> 07:45.000
Why don't we go to the
conference room and sit down?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.620
What?
Katherine, just tell me.

07:47.620 --> 07:49.670
Please.
Okay.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.790
The good news is I was able to
get you a 60-day extension

07:51.790 --> 07:53.460
on the foreclosure.

07:53.460 --> 07:55.460
If we can get caught up
on the payments by then,

07:55.460 --> 07:57.460
you won't lose the house.
Oh, thank God.

07:57.460 --> 07:59.620
That's great. You can use
Jon's life-insurance money.

07:59.620 --> 08:01.880
Yeah, that's coming
any day now, so...

08:01.880 --> 08:04.420
It's not that simple.

08:04.420 --> 08:06.210
The commercial loan
that Jon took out

08:06.210 --> 08:08.040
was for some properties
he was underwater on.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.920
How much does he owe?

08:10.920 --> 08:13.250
-$18 million.
-Oh, geez.

08:15.500 --> 08:18.080
And it's what you owe.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.710
Gary: What?

08:19.710 --> 08:24.670
Since Jon used your personal
assets to secure the loan,

08:24.670 --> 08:29.080
once it defaults, they're gonna
come after everything,

08:29.080 --> 08:30.920
including
Jon's life insurance.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.750
I just need a minute.

08:36.750 --> 08:40.080
-I can't believe this.
-$18 million.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.080
-I don't even know what to say.
-No way.

08:42.080 --> 08:45.790
-This doesn't make any sense.
-No. No, D, come on.

08:45.790 --> 08:47.750
Come on. There's got to be
an explanation here, right?

08:47.750 --> 08:50.210
This doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't make any sense.

08:50.210 --> 08:53.540
Yeah? Maybe it
makes perfect sense.

08:53.540 --> 08:55.710
'Cause this whole time,
I've been trying to figure out

08:55.710 --> 08:59.710
why he did this, thinking
that I killed my husband,

08:59.710 --> 09:03.040
that my secret is the reason
he did this,

09:03.040 --> 09:05.080
when all along,
it was just -- it was him.

09:05.080 --> 09:08.210
He lied, Gary.
He lied to me, to all of us,

09:08.210 --> 09:10.460
then he couldn't live
with himself, so he just

09:10.460 --> 09:12.880
left us with nothing,
not even a note.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.290
I refuse to believe that,
okay?

09:15.290 --> 09:17.080
The Jon that I knew,
the Jon that --

09:17.080 --> 09:18.540
that we all knew --
would not have --

09:18.540 --> 09:20.080
Will you stop defending him?!
Stop defending him!

09:20.080 --> 09:21.880
Ever since you met him
on that elevator,

09:21.880 --> 09:23.920
you've put him
on a pedestal.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.170
Guess what? That Jon Dixon?
He doesn't exist.
Come on, D!

09:26.170 --> 09:28.330
The man had a plan
for everything!

09:28.330 --> 09:30.120
I'm done.
Please, stop.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.500
Ah.

09:31.500 --> 09:32.750
Just go.

09:50.790 --> 09:54.790
Jon: Dale, I'm stepping
on the elevator,

09:54.790 --> 09:56.790
okay, so you got
about 15 seconds

09:56.790 --> 09:58.580
before this call is over.

09:58.580 --> 10:00.000
Do we have a deal or not?

10:01.170 --> 10:04.330
Good.
Send the paperwork over.

10:08.620 --> 10:11.210
You know, I've used that, uh,
"stepping on an elevator" bit

10:11.210 --> 10:12.960
I don't know how many times,
and this is the first time

10:12.960 --> 10:14.790
I actually was.

10:14.790 --> 10:17.620
Is this, in fact, your first
time on an elevator?

10:17.620 --> 10:19.210
'Cause you haven't
picked a floor yet.

10:19.210 --> 10:21.960
As a matter of fact,
it's not.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.960
That's not good.
No, it isn't.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.380
We get it.
You'd like to go to P1.

10:37.380 --> 10:38.670
That's not happening.

10:38.670 --> 10:40.000
Man: Hello?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.620
Uh...
hey, we're stuck.

10:42.620 --> 10:44.290
Could you please
un-stuck us?

10:44.290 --> 10:45.880
Nope. Let's let Hugo Boss here
take the lead, please.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.750
Let me take the lead.

10:49.830 --> 10:53.000
Hi, my name's Jon Dixon, and the
only reason I'm on this elevator

10:53.000 --> 10:55.540
is because your boss wants me
to buy this building.

10:55.540 --> 10:58.000
Call me a stickler,
but I like my buildings

10:58.000 --> 10:59.330
to have working elevators.

10:59.330 --> 11:01.830
Please tell Dale
he has 20 minutes

11:01.830 --> 11:05.000
to get us out of here or
the deal we just made is off.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Uh, right away, sir.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.420
Nicely done.

11:08.420 --> 11:09.830
Thanks.

11:09.830 --> 11:12.830
And it's, uh, Armani.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.040
Mervyn's.

11:22.670 --> 11:24.500
Hey, bud, guess what...

11:24.500 --> 11:26.000
since we're not
playing tonight,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.580
I'm gonna sneak back for the
5K, so we can run it together.

11:29.580 --> 11:32.540
That's awesome, but I'm pretty
fast, so try to keep up.

11:32.540 --> 11:35.380
Yeah, I'll try to.

11:35.380 --> 11:36.540
Are you
at Aunt Delilah's?

11:36.540 --> 11:37.750
Yeah.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.380
I've been hanging out
with Danny all week

11:39.380 --> 11:41.750
while Mom helps Aunt Delilah
with her problem.

11:41.750 --> 11:43.710
Her problem?

11:43.710 --> 11:46.710
People think I'm reading,
but I'm also listening.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.210
Dad? Dad?

11:50.210 --> 11:53.040
Ah, bummer.

11:53.040 --> 11:56.880
Hey, so...you want to tell me
about this problem?

12:01.580 --> 12:03.120
Oh, hey.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.750
Hey. I wanted to
give you this.

12:05.750 --> 12:07.380
It's my allowance.

12:07.380 --> 12:08.960
I want to sponsor you
for the race.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.420
Oh, wow.
Thanks, Elliot.

12:11.420 --> 12:12.580
It would have been $20,

12:12.580 --> 12:14.420
but I got a Slurpee
on the way over, so...

12:14.420 --> 12:16.080
Is that why
your lips are blue?

12:16.080 --> 12:18.500
Totally.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.080
So, um,
you wanna hang out?

12:20.080 --> 12:21.080
Sure.

12:23.790 --> 12:26.830
Oh...actually, I, um --

12:26.830 --> 12:28.580
I-I have to help
make dinner.

12:28.580 --> 12:30.170
I promised my mom,
and --

12:30.170 --> 12:32.120
Okay, well, then...
Yeah.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.290
...see you later.

12:35.290 --> 12:36.920
Bye, Elliot.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.500
Later, Danny!

12:43.460 --> 12:44.830
Delilah: I think
we have a little bit of time

12:44.830 --> 12:46.670
before we have to go
to the bank.

12:46.670 --> 12:48.620
Uh, yeah, okay, so let's get
the documents together.

12:48.620 --> 12:50.790
Hey, sweetie.
I'll get this stuff
in the office.

12:50.790 --> 12:52.830
Why does a 7-year-old know
more about what's going on

12:52.830 --> 12:54.170
in our family than I do?

12:54.170 --> 12:55.790
What are you
talking about?

12:55.790 --> 12:58.170
Theo told me about
your little problem

12:58.170 --> 12:59.670
that Katherine's
helping you with.

13:00.960 --> 13:04.960
Mom.
What is going on?

13:14.290 --> 13:15.210
Sophie:
Are we gonna have to move?

13:15.210 --> 13:17.620
I hope not.

13:17.620 --> 13:20.380
Wait, so you...you didn't
know about any of this?

13:20.380 --> 13:21.380
He didn't tell you?

13:21.380 --> 13:23.960
No.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.290
How could
he do this to us?

13:25.290 --> 13:27.290
I'm sure he didn't mean
to hurt us.

13:27.290 --> 13:28.670
He lied to you.

13:28.670 --> 13:31.120
He lied to us.
Dad's not a lair!

13:31.120 --> 13:34.670
Yeah. Yeah, that's
exactly what he was, Danny.

13:34.670 --> 13:37.500
He pretended to be
this perfect guy,

13:37.500 --> 13:40.040
all while hiding
who he really was inside.

13:40.040 --> 13:43.670
I wanted to run
this race for my dad.

13:43.670 --> 13:47.040
But I'm not gonna run a race
for someone I didn't even know.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.830
I'm out.

14:00.170 --> 14:04.040
Heads up?
Door's unlocked!

14:05.670 --> 14:08.330
You know, the gesture
of you giving me this key

14:08.330 --> 14:11.500
means a little less when me
or any local murderer

14:11.500 --> 14:13.250
can just waltz in
and have --

Hey.

14:32.920 --> 14:34.380
Hi.
I just, uh,

14:34.380 --> 14:36.750
walked through
your unlocked door...

14:36.750 --> 14:38.540
Hmm.
...FYI.

14:38.540 --> 14:40.250
Okay.

14:40.250 --> 14:42.750
There may or may not be a serial
killer hiding in your closet.

14:42.750 --> 14:44.710
But don't worry. He just wants
to try on your little baby shoes

14:44.710 --> 14:47.210
and then kill you
for your skin.

14:47.210 --> 14:49.790
Ah, well, he's in luck,
'cause I moisturize every day.

14:49.790 --> 14:52.790
Are you okay?
How'd it go with D?

14:52.790 --> 14:56.540
Believe it or not,
worse than your morning.

14:56.540 --> 14:59.290
The situation is...
is not great.

14:59.290 --> 15:00.750
You want to
talk about it?

15:00.750 --> 15:02.580
I really don't.

15:02.580 --> 15:04.420
I would, however,
love to know where you think

15:04.420 --> 15:06.790
you're going because, unless
it's to get more lotion

15:06.790 --> 15:11.580
for your freakishly soft skin --
I am going for a run.

15:11.580 --> 15:13.250
Deal with it.

15:13.250 --> 15:17.080
Maggie, you just
had 15 milligrams of chemo

15:17.080 --> 15:20.080
pumped through your veins.
Do you really think going --
Gary.

15:20.080 --> 15:24.080
Look, chemo can take my hair,
but it cannot take my running.

15:24.080 --> 15:27.080
This is the one thing I have
left that makes me feel like me.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.250
You're being --
Irrational?

15:29.250 --> 15:31.920
Yeah.
Yes. I am.

15:33.620 --> 15:37.170
I get that the odds of me
finishing this race

15:37.170 --> 15:39.460
are just stacked
against me.

15:39.460 --> 15:43.960
But right now,
I just need to believe in this.

15:45.460 --> 15:47.460
Okay.

15:47.460 --> 15:48.830
Let's do it.

15:48.830 --> 15:51.210
Really?
Sure.

15:51.210 --> 15:53.460
What changed?

15:53.460 --> 15:57.500
I guess right now, I could use
something to believe in, too.

16:00.170 --> 16:02.000
Rome:
So what are you saying?

16:02.000 --> 16:04.040
I don't know.

16:04.040 --> 16:06.290
Maybe we should just
liquidate the restaurant.

16:06.290 --> 16:07.670
If the new subway stop
comes in,

16:07.670 --> 16:09.460
we could probably sell
the lease for a profit.
What?!

16:09.460 --> 16:11.040
Listen, you're not giving up
on the restaurant.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.830
That is your dream.

16:12.830 --> 16:15.120
But how are we gonna pay for it?

16:15.120 --> 16:16.500
Look, I wasn't gonna
say anything,

16:16.500 --> 16:18.880
but my commercial agent
reached out.

16:18.880 --> 16:20.710
Word on the street
is they fired the director

16:20.710 --> 16:22.500
for the car campaign
that I turned down.
Rome,

16:22.500 --> 16:24.500
you just got off
your meds.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.670
And while bedroom-me
is delighted --

16:26.670 --> 16:30.500
You're welcome.
...outside-the-bedroom-me
is worried.

16:30.500 --> 16:33.500
If you think I'm on edge now,
you taking a job

16:33.500 --> 16:36.880
you called "soul-crushing" is
not gonna make me feel better.

16:36.880 --> 16:39.880
I'm in a different place now,
Gina, and I never want

16:39.880 --> 16:42.040
you to feel the way that
Delilah's feeling right now.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.500
Neither do I.

16:44.500 --> 16:47.710
Which is exactly why I don't
want you doing this.

16:47.710 --> 16:50.330
What we need
is an investor.

16:50.330 --> 16:51.920
No. Please, please don't --
Yep.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.330
My mother.
Whoa.

16:53.330 --> 16:55.170
Now you need to
be on medication

16:55.170 --> 16:57.750
because she's a bitter pill
that you do not want to swallow.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.330
She's not that bad.
The woman bought you

17:00.330 --> 17:02.790
cooking lessons after
your last restaurant went under.

17:02.790 --> 17:04.790
I can't believe
she did that.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.040
You...

17:07.040 --> 17:09.580
I...

17:11.210 --> 17:13.580
Thank you for waiting,
but I'm sorry, Mrs. Dixon.

17:13.580 --> 17:16.420
Since you aren't the owner
or officer of Winthrop Holdings,

17:16.420 --> 17:19.210
I can't release the documents
that you've requested.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.790
Unless you
want to call upstairs

17:24.790 --> 17:26.580
and tell your boss
the loan defaulted

17:26.580 --> 17:29.210
because you lost three weeks
to probate court,

17:29.210 --> 17:31.210
it is in everyone's
best interest

17:31.210 --> 17:32.920
you get my client
up to speed ASAP.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.540
I...

17:34.540 --> 17:37.250
Look, my husband used our assets
to secure this loan

17:37.250 --> 17:38.580
without my approval.

17:38.580 --> 17:41.620
And I'd ask him about it,
but he's dead.

17:44.670 --> 17:46.460
I'll make a call.

17:50.830 --> 17:55.250
Terri, I'm gonna need you
to pull some documents.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.290
Hi.
I'd like to close out
this account

18:02.290 --> 18:03.670
and withdraw
the remaining funds.

18:03.670 --> 18:05.580
Rutledge. Alright.

18:05.580 --> 18:08.120
Would you like the money wired,
or is a cashier's check okay?

18:08.120 --> 18:09.920
Uh, cashier's check is fine.
Bank manager: Okay, thanks.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.460
My assistant
is making copies

18:11.460 --> 18:13.250
of the documents
that you've requested,

18:13.250 --> 18:16.420
so...there's no need to
"call upstairs."

18:16.420 --> 18:18.790
I'll get you some coffee
while you're waiting.

18:18.790 --> 18:21.460
I promise, it's from today.

18:21.460 --> 18:23.960
Alright, so the Rutledge account
is closed out.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.790
Is there anything we could do
differently next time?

18:25.790 --> 18:27.170
Uh, no, you were great.

18:31.170 --> 18:32.500
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.710
Excuse me. Mrs. Dixon?
Oh, no.

18:35.710 --> 18:36.960
Did you need
something else?

18:36.960 --> 18:39.120
Mrs. Dixon.
You dropped your glove.

18:39.120 --> 18:41.120
-No. Uh, no, thanks.

I'm fine. It's fine.

19:37.750 --> 19:39.670
You keep pacing like that,
you're gonna wear out the cable.

19:39.670 --> 19:40.880
What?!
Is that a thing?!

19:40.880 --> 19:42.750
It is if it'll make
you sit down.

19:42.750 --> 19:44.580
Okay, alright, alright,
distraction.

19:44.580 --> 19:48.170

Okay.

Mr. Sinicrope.

19:55.080 --> 19:57.290
My music teacher
in high school.

19:57.290 --> 19:59.710
He's the reason I started
playing guitar.

19:59.710 --> 20:01.080
He believed in me.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.960
I just, uh --
I just want to say thanks.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.040
Blah!
Jon:

20:04.040 --> 20:05.290
Save that for
the awards show, right?

20:07.380 --> 20:09.420
Lawrence Kasdan.

20:09.420 --> 20:13.380
Great writer,
directs his own stuff.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.540
That's what I want to do.

20:15.540 --> 20:17.380
"Grand Canyon," you guys.
That's cool.

20:17.380 --> 20:18.290
That's like literally
what I said.

20:18.290 --> 20:20.380
No, literally it's not.

20:20.380 --> 20:22.380
You didn't say
Lawrence Kasdan.

20:22.380 --> 20:24.880
Okay,
who would you eat with?

20:27.080 --> 20:28.710
I would have dinner
with the man

20:28.710 --> 20:32.580
who has affected all of our
lives and doesn't even know it.

20:32.580 --> 20:34.960
Sometimes you don't realize
the impact that someone has

20:34.960 --> 20:36.920
on your life
until it's too late.

20:36.920 --> 20:40.460
So I choose T. Rutledge.

20:40.460 --> 20:41.790
Awesome. Who's that?

20:48.620 --> 20:52.250
The guy who inspected
this stupid elevator --

20:52.250 --> 20:54.960
or failed to -- is my pick.

20:54.960 --> 20:56.790
Wait, I changed my mind.

20:56.790 --> 20:58.580
I want to eat
with your music teacher.

20:58.580 --> 21:00.580
Intimate dinner for two,
just me and Mr. Sinicrope.

21:00.580 --> 21:02.620
How about you?
Who would you have dinner with?

21:02.620 --> 21:05.420
Um...my wife and kids.

21:05.420 --> 21:07.170
This is when we learn
that you killed 'em.

21:07.170 --> 21:08.750
Mm.

21:08.750 --> 21:11.250
No, I -- I, uh -- I don't get
home for dinner often enough.

21:11.250 --> 21:13.670
Sometimes I --
I-I'll wonder if I'm making

21:13.670 --> 21:16.120
the right choices...

21:16.120 --> 21:19.120
but I'm just trying to
take care of them.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.040
Maggie: Hey. Hey, you know
they expect you to run

21:21.040 --> 21:22.380
the whole 5K at once,
right?

21:23.790 --> 21:25.380
I'm ready.
Alright.

21:25.380 --> 21:27.170
"K" -- What does
the "K" stand for?

21:27.170 --> 21:29.460
"Kicking your ass,"
apparently.

21:29.460 --> 21:31.670
Mm, this one.

21:31.670 --> 21:33.460
So, I must say,

21:33.460 --> 21:36.290
after my last visit, I was
surprised to get your call.

21:36.290 --> 21:39.290
I thought you didn't want me
to invest in your restaurant.

21:39.290 --> 21:41.670
I'm sorry.
I -- I know.

21:41.670 --> 21:44.120
I...should not have lost
my temper like that.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.120
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

21:47.120 --> 21:48.880
I know I come on strong
sometimes,

21:48.880 --> 21:50.710
but I can't help it.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.120
If you were a mother,
you'd real--
Mom.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.580
If -- You'd realize

21:54.580 --> 21:57.420
that I just want to be
involved in your life.

21:57.420 --> 21:59.580
And I -- I know it doesn't
always come off like that,

21:59.580 --> 22:03.080
but all I really want
is a fresh start.

22:04.830 --> 22:06.000
Can we try that?

22:07.420 --> 22:09.420
A fresh start?
Yeah.

22:09.420 --> 22:10.580
That would be nice.

22:10.580 --> 22:11.830
Mm.

22:15.040 --> 22:18.040
I'm so excited you finally
are cooking your food.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.670
I mean...not like
the last place.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.670
Um...
What does that mean?

22:26.670 --> 22:31.080
I just mean that
the old place was just stuffy --

22:31.080 --> 22:34.580
deconstructed this
and rehydrated that.

22:34.580 --> 22:35.920
You don't need gimmicks.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.380
I know what you meant.

22:37.380 --> 22:38.540
You meant that I should've
listened to you.

22:38.540 --> 22:41.960
I mean, a-at what age
do I get to decide

22:41.960 --> 22:44.040
who I am and what I am?

22:49.460 --> 22:50.540
Let me ask you something.

22:52.210 --> 22:55.460
Did you want me to invest,

22:55.460 --> 22:59.380
or did you just...
need someone to invest?

22:59.380 --> 23:03.080
Hmm?

23:03.080 --> 23:06.080
Yeah. I thought so.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.920
You say you want
a fresh start,

23:07.920 --> 23:10.540
but how is that gonna happen
if you don't give me the chance?

23:13.210 --> 23:17.040
I am going to go home.

23:17.040 --> 23:20.620
Let me know if you decide
to give me that chance.

23:25.420 --> 23:27.580
Sorry it took so long
at the bank.

23:27.580 --> 23:29.170
Oh, it was totally worth it

23:29.170 --> 23:31.250
just to see the look
on that guy's face.

23:31.250 --> 23:33.460
He was terrified of you.

23:33.460 --> 23:36.620
If his office had walls,
he'd be crying in it right now.

23:37.790 --> 23:39.580
It's so late.

23:39.580 --> 23:42.500
You and -- You and Theo
should just stay for dinner.

23:42.500 --> 23:44.500
Sure.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.670
Eddie.

23:51.670 --> 23:54.250
Hey. Uh...

23:54.250 --> 23:57.250
Katherine,
I left you a voicemail.

23:57.250 --> 24:01.040
I came to surprise Theo
with a sleepover, but...

24:01.040 --> 24:04.460
Sophie told me everything.
I am...so sorry.

24:04.460 --> 24:06.460
D, why didn't you tell me
what was going on?

24:06.460 --> 24:10.040
I just -- I, eh -- We --
We didn't want to worry you

24:10.040 --> 24:12.000
while you were on tour.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.460
Are you okay?

24:16.460 --> 24:21.620
Hanging in there, in -- in...no
small part thanks to Katherine.

24:26.210 --> 24:28.500
I should go.
Katherine.

24:28.500 --> 24:32.040
Are you sure you don't want to
stay just for a quick dinner?

24:32.040 --> 24:33.830
I'm good.

24:36.290 --> 24:38.460
Theo, come on.
We're leaving.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.040
Maggie:
What do you got there?

24:47.040 --> 24:48.170
Well, it's race day...
Uh-huh.

24:48.170 --> 24:52.170
...so I got you...

24:52.170 --> 24:53.580
thermal underwear.
Oh.

24:53.580 --> 24:55.000
Button fly.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.170
That's right.
You spoil me.

24:56.170 --> 24:57.580
I also made you a playlist

24:57.580 --> 25:00.580
based on your personal
super-quick pace,

25:00.580 --> 25:03.670
so I hope you like
Britney Spears and Arcade Fire.

25:03.670 --> 25:06.670
Because rhythmically,
they're shockingly similar.

25:06.670 --> 25:08.670
I love your support.

25:08.670 --> 25:11.080
Race gear, playlist,

25:11.080 --> 25:14.500
your need to believe
in something...

25:14.500 --> 25:16.330
You want to talk about
what's really going on here?

25:16.330 --> 25:18.000
Yeah, I'm your one-man
pit crew.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.710
That's what's up.
No, this is called avoidance.

25:21.710 --> 25:23.540
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

25:23.540 --> 25:25.960
You're not gonna -- You're not
gonna therapize me, Dr. Bloom.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.210
You cannot keep running
from this, Gary.

25:28.210 --> 25:29.540
Running.
That's word play.

25:29.540 --> 25:32.750
That's fantastic.
Gary, hey, stop.

25:32.750 --> 25:34.210
Talk to me.

25:38.420 --> 25:40.880
Okay.

25:44.580 --> 25:49.040
Nobody believes in Jon
right now, except for me.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.790
And I get it.
I-I get that, uh,

25:51.790 --> 25:54.210
the facts on the ground
are looking pretty grim,

25:54.210 --> 25:59.290
but in my gut, Maggie, uh,
in...in my heart...

26:03.580 --> 26:07.000
You see, Jon believed in me
when I didn't believe in myself,

26:07.000 --> 26:12.170
so...how can I possibly
turn on him now

26:12.170 --> 26:14.000
when he needs me
the most?

26:16.290 --> 26:19.250
Jon was everything
you thought he was.

26:19.250 --> 26:21.080
He was strong,

26:21.080 --> 26:24.080
he was loyal,
he was brilliant.

26:25.750 --> 26:29.420
But he was also human...

26:29.420 --> 26:31.170
like the rest of us.

26:33.620 --> 26:38.420
You are not betraying him
by admitting that he is human.

26:43.580 --> 26:46.170
Your hourly rate
must be very high.

26:46.170 --> 26:47.710
It's outrageous.

26:52.620 --> 26:54.290
What is it?

26:54.290 --> 26:55.880
Uh, it's Delilah.

26:55.880 --> 26:58.460
She says Sophie's
not doing the race.
Are you kidding me?!

26:58.460 --> 27:00.290
That's the whole reason
we're doing this thing!

27:00.290 --> 27:01.790
I've been training
for months.

27:02.790 --> 27:03.830
Weeks.

27:05.120 --> 27:06.830
A very intense 72 hours.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.790
Hey, Carter. What's up?

27:10.790 --> 27:13.460
I was going through those bank
statements like you asked.

27:13.460 --> 27:15.960
There is something
you're gonna want to see.

27:15.960 --> 27:17.460
Okay,
I'll be right there.

27:21.290 --> 27:23.540
Hello.
My name is Gary...

27:23.540 --> 27:26.290
and I'm going door to door
to apologize to everyone

27:26.290 --> 27:29.210
for everything I have
ever said or done.

27:29.210 --> 27:30.880
Is the lady of the house
at home?

27:32.670 --> 27:34.170
You! Up!

27:37.330 --> 27:38.330
Hey, you!

27:38.330 --> 27:40.670
Yes, you!
What is this?

27:40.670 --> 27:42.330
You seriously not gonna
run this race?

27:42.330 --> 27:44.670
Look at me, I'm -- I'm wearing
compression pants for you.

27:44.670 --> 27:46.670
Well, looking good,
but just 'cause I'm not running

27:46.670 --> 27:49.080
it doesn't mean you guys can't.
Come on!

27:49.080 --> 27:51.880
We're not doing it without you,
and I really want to go.

27:51.880 --> 27:54.500
Look, I'm not gonna run the race
just 'cause some girl

27:54.500 --> 27:56.580
you have a crush on
donated to our team.

27:58.670 --> 28:01.330
Oh, something tells me
a certain Ella's gonna be there.

28:03.170 --> 28:06.170
You know what?
Let's just forget it.

28:06.170 --> 28:08.920
No. It's okay.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.580
The thing is...

28:16.750 --> 28:19.120
...Ella --
Ella isn't a girl.

28:21.880 --> 28:23.620
Ella is Elliot.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.750
Oh, sweetie.

28:26.750 --> 28:28.880
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you earlier.

28:28.880 --> 28:31.710
I just...I didn't want to
disappoint you.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.080
Disappoint me?
Are you...

28:34.080 --> 28:36.920
Are you kidding?

28:36.920 --> 28:41.290
Listen to me, you have never
and will never disappoint me

28:41.290 --> 28:43.880
for --
for being you, okay?

28:46.080 --> 28:47.040
Okay.

28:50.750 --> 28:54.960
I guess...I guess I was just
trying to be the person

28:54.960 --> 28:57.420
you thought I was.

28:57.420 --> 29:00.000
Maybe that's why Dad
kept things from us, too.

29:00.000 --> 29:05.080
Because he was just trying to be
the person we thought he was.

29:05.080 --> 29:09.290
Well, just when I thought I
couldn't be more proud of you.

29:10.790 --> 29:14.420
Okay, we have to go
to the race now...

29:14.420 --> 29:16.460
'cause I can't wait
to meet this Elliot.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.920
Alright.
Let's go get changed.

29:36.960 --> 29:38.120
Alright!

29:38.120 --> 29:39.330
This is happening.
Okay.

29:39.330 --> 29:42.540
We're here.
How are you feeling?

29:42.540 --> 29:44.960
Oh, I'm rocking a B12 patch
under my gentleman's thermals,

29:44.960 --> 29:48.120
and I got Britney in my pocket,
so I'm gonna crush this!

29:48.120 --> 29:50.790
I am both scared
and turned on by you.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.670
It's the gentleman's
thermals.

29:52.670 --> 29:54.670
Oh, he's here.

29:54.670 --> 29:56.000
Back from tour!

29:56.000 --> 29:57.670
Ha ha!
One night only!

29:57.670 --> 30:00.210
Hottest rock star this side
of the sign-in table...

30:00.210 --> 30:01.830
Eddie Saville!

30:01.830 --> 30:04.500
Aww, you have pico de gallo
on your vest.

30:04.500 --> 30:05.960
Eat it.
It's like I never left.

30:05.960 --> 30:07.380
Hey,
did you stretch yet?

30:07.380 --> 30:10.670
Don't need to.
I'm 7. I'm pretty limber.

30:10.670 --> 30:13.120
I got to teach you
about winning, Theo.

30:13.120 --> 30:14.420
Hey, Gina, you want to come
stretch with us?

30:14.420 --> 30:18.670
Look, the race is won
before it's even begun.

30:18.670 --> 30:20.830
Hey...

30:20.830 --> 30:24.670
How about next time
one of our friends...

30:24.670 --> 30:26.880
goes $18 million
into debt,

30:26.880 --> 30:28.830
one of you just --
just texts me.

30:28.830 --> 30:30.500
You gonna write a check?
Is that what you're thinking?

30:32.210 --> 30:35.830
I...am thinking about that day
we met in the elevator.

30:35.830 --> 30:38.500
Yeah, you were terrified.
I was not terrified.

30:38.500 --> 30:39.920
I have video footage
that says otherwise.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.710
I was pretty terrified.
Yeah, you were.

30:42.710 --> 30:45.080
You know, what sucks is Jon
was there for all of us

30:45.080 --> 30:46.710
from the very beginning,

30:46.710 --> 30:50.170
and it turns out he really
needed us, too...

30:50.170 --> 30:51.670
and we weren't there
for him.

30:51.670 --> 30:54.250
And here we are,
running this race

30:54.250 --> 30:56.540
to try
and prevent suicide --

30:56.540 --> 30:59.620
all I think is...we couldn't get
him over the finish line.

31:03.710 --> 31:05.380
Thank you.

31:05.380 --> 31:06.380
Woman:
You're welcome.

31:07.710 --> 31:09.380
Delilah: Is the Elliot?
He's so cute.

31:09.380 --> 31:10.710
So is Danny.

31:10.710 --> 31:11.710
I'm talking about Danny.

31:17.120 --> 31:20.960
Hey.
This 5K isn't for Dad.

31:20.960 --> 31:23.380
Today's for us, okay?

31:23.380 --> 31:26.380
'Cause...we're the ones
who are still here.

31:28.540 --> 31:29.960
Hmm?

31:29.960 --> 31:32.580
You ready, champ?
Yeah.

31:32.580 --> 31:34.250
Elliot:
Good luck, Danny.

31:34.250 --> 31:37.420
Man: Good afternoon, racers!
Get ready to take your places!

31:37.420 --> 31:40.080
Remember, pace,
that's what we talked about.

31:40.080 --> 31:41.460
Yep.
Pace ourselves.

31:41.460 --> 31:42.580
Yep.

31:42.580 --> 31:43.920
Thank you, racers,

31:43.920 --> 31:45.500
for supporting
the 5K for the 5 Signs.

31:45.500 --> 31:46.750
Hey.
Hey.

31:46.750 --> 31:48.080
We want to thank
all our sponsors

31:48.080 --> 31:49.500
for their tremendous support.

31:49.500 --> 31:52.500
So...don't get mad.

31:52.500 --> 31:54.330
Opposite effect.

31:54.330 --> 31:56.580
Just reached out to my agent...
On your marks.

31:56.580 --> 31:59.500
...and if I want it...
the car campaign's mine.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.790
Get set!
What?!

32:03.420 --> 32:05.000
We are not done
talking about this.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.250
Gary: I said pace!

32:08.620 --> 32:11.790
Maggie, wait for me! I thought
we were running together!

32:11.790 --> 32:14.000
That's not slow and steady!

32:14.000 --> 32:16.420
Okay! See you
at the finish line!

32:16.420 --> 32:19.000
These are just
the Winthrop loan statements.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.790
We've seen these.
Uh, look closely, Counselor.

32:21.790 --> 32:24.040
Reduce that by half.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.460
I'm sorry.
Look at the dates.

32:26.460 --> 32:29.460
There have been six payments
made since Jon died.

32:29.460 --> 32:31.790
But who's making them?
Exactly.

32:31.790 --> 32:33.380
You think we can track
these deposits back

32:33.380 --> 32:34.620
to their source account?

32:34.620 --> 32:36.540
By "we," you mean me,
right?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.170
I'm sorry.
My blood sugar's low.

32:41.620 --> 32:44.620
Who plans a freaking 5K
in January?

32:44.620 --> 32:48.040
I saw a guy back there
wearing a parka and shorts.

32:48.040 --> 32:48.880
Hey. Hi.

32:48.880 --> 32:50.500
Thank you.
-Water!

32:50.500 --> 32:52.040
What, you gonna run away
from me again?
Gina...

32:52.040 --> 32:53.460
No, listen.
No.

32:53.460 --> 32:56.330
I love that you're willing
to make sacrifices for me,

32:56.330 --> 32:58.960
okay, but you are not going
back to that job, Rome.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.790
We are not
tempting fate here.

33:00.790 --> 33:04.710
Then what are we gonna do?
What's the alternative, Gina?

33:05.920 --> 33:07.710
I met with my mom
about being an investor.

33:07.710 --> 33:09.080
No, you didn't.
I did.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.670
Oh, how'd that go?

33:10.670 --> 33:13.500
You know...?

33:13.500 --> 33:15.250
It may have been the best
we ever got along.

33:15.250 --> 33:16.250
Really?

33:16.250 --> 33:17.330
Yeah, come on.

33:21.170 --> 33:23.170
-All right.
-Water?

34:12.710 --> 34:14.880
Yes!

34:14.880 --> 34:16.790
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Danny, you're unbelievable.

34:16.790 --> 34:19.290
Yes!
I am so proud of me!

34:19.290 --> 34:20.920
Do you want to do this
right here?

34:20.920 --> 34:22.880
No way.

34:24.540 --> 34:26.290
Not too bad.

34:26.290 --> 34:29.750
My feet hurt so much.

34:29.750 --> 34:32.920
Hi, you must be Elliot.
So happy to meet you.

34:32.920 --> 34:33.920
Nice to meet you, too,
Mrs. Dixon.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.920
Hey. I'm Sophie.

34:35.920 --> 34:39.330
Victory...is ours!
Yes!

34:39.330 --> 34:42.080
Thank God...'cause
my back is killing me.

34:44.420 --> 34:47.000
-Buddy, high ten.
-One and done.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.580
-Whoo-hoo!
-Yeah!

34:48.580 --> 34:51.250
-One and done.
-Nice set of footprints for us.

34:51.250 --> 34:53.250
Where's Maggie?
She was...

34:53.250 --> 34:55.080
-Huh?
-...way ahead of us.

34:55.080 --> 34:56.080
Regina: We thought
she was with you.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.580
No, she wasn't with me.

35:00.460 --> 35:04.080
-Does he see Maggie?
-No, he can't find her.

35:04.080 --> 35:05.080
Maggie!

35:05.080 --> 35:06.080
Maggie!
Oh, no...

35:10.670 --> 35:11.670
-Hey, watch out, buddy.
-I know. I know.

35:11.670 --> 35:12.670
-Wrong way, man.
-Hey, look out, man.

35:12.670 --> 35:14.710
-Sorry.
-Yo. Wrong way, dude.

35:14.710 --> 35:16.710
-Hey, yo. Hey, yo.
-Watch where you're going, man.

35:16.710 --> 35:18.670
Turn it around.

35:18.670 --> 35:21.290
Maggie!

35:21.290 --> 35:23.670
Hey. Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

35:23.670 --> 35:25.380
Talk to me. You okay?

35:25.380 --> 35:27.620
Yeah. Fine.

35:27.620 --> 35:31.000
I'm fine. It's just...

35:31.000 --> 35:32.620
I don't think
I can do this.

35:32.620 --> 35:33.960
That's okay.
It's okay.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.790
It's not okay!

35:36.790 --> 35:38.960
I hate this.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.620
It's not fair.

35:40.620 --> 35:43.170
I hate that I'm weak,
I hate that I'm nauseous,

35:43.170 --> 35:46.380
I hate that my body
won't do what I need it to do.

35:48.670 --> 35:50.420
Will you look at me, please?

35:50.420 --> 35:52.830
Hey.

35:55.670 --> 35:58.670
You're strong.

35:58.670 --> 36:00.830
You're powerful.

36:00.830 --> 36:02.670
You're brilliant.

36:05.710 --> 36:07.170
You're also human.

36:09.750 --> 36:10.920
You're quoting me to me.

36:10.920 --> 36:13.380
I sure am.

36:13.380 --> 36:16.540
Well, at least
you were listening.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.710
Still, it would've been
nice to finish.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.670
You can still finish.

36:31.380 --> 36:34.120
Yeah, let's do this.

36:37.750 --> 36:38.540
I'm gonna smoke you.

36:40.120 --> 36:41.120
Trash talk.

36:41.120 --> 36:44.920
Yeah.
It's a force of habit.

36:44.920 --> 36:47.880
Okay.

36:51.250 --> 36:54.040
Oh, I'm losing
to hot nuts.

36:54.040 --> 36:57.210
I used to dance
under the name Hot Nuts.

36:57.210 --> 36:59.540
Yeah?
You make a lot of money?

36:59.540 --> 37:00.580
Not as much as I did

37:00.580 --> 37:02.710
when I danced
under the name Spicy Nuts.

37:02.710 --> 37:05.040
Oh, I'm about to
get timed out.

37:07.420 --> 37:09.040
Oh, no, you're not.
Let's go, Maggie.

37:09.040 --> 37:11.040
-Hi, Maggie.
-We got this.

37:11.040 --> 37:13.290
Hey, mama.
Hey, how's it going?

37:13.290 --> 37:14.920
-Good.
-I need to tie my shoe.
Just give me a second.

37:14.920 --> 37:16.420
It's a big foot.
What the hell you doing, buddy?

37:16.420 --> 37:18.830
I just need to get Velcro shoes.
It would be much easier.
Ohh.

37:18.830 --> 37:22.250
Ah, hey, man.
Oh, oh, this is a great rig.

37:22.250 --> 37:23.620
What do you got
under the hood?

37:23.620 --> 37:25.460
Uh, diesel? Bio-diesel?

37:25.460 --> 37:27.670
We got you, girl.

37:27.670 --> 37:30.830
You hear that?
They got you.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.170
-Do we need more?
-Wait, so, how many do we have?

37:37.170 --> 37:39.000
-Yes. I think we're good.
-Yeah.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
-How many are on here?
-14.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.580
Oh! I can see them!
Oh!

37:41.580 --> 37:42.580
-Get into position!
-Oh, God!

37:42.580 --> 37:44.580
-You can do it!
-Whoo!

37:44.580 --> 37:47.170
-You can do it!
-Yes!

37:47.170 --> 37:48.330
Go, Margaret!

37:48.330 --> 37:49.580
Oh, my God...

37:49.580 --> 37:51.920
Oh, wow.

37:54.170 --> 37:57.380
Ah, man. Okay.

37:57.380 --> 37:58.880
Let's do --
Let's do a little...

37:58.880 --> 38:00.290
Whoa, whoa, what is -- What,
we're mo-- We're doing a thing?

38:00.290 --> 38:01.330
Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I dropped a hot pack.

38:01.330 --> 38:03.330
Uh-oh.
Okay.

38:03.330 --> 38:05.540
Okay.
Okay, just take it easy.

38:08.120 --> 38:12.960
Together: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

38:19.710 --> 38:21.210
Yes!

38:21.210 --> 38:22.620
Oh,
I'm so proud of you.

38:22.620 --> 38:24.960
Thank you.

38:27.500 --> 38:28.960
Oh, thank you.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.790
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

38:30.790 --> 38:33.120
Nice race.
Well played.

38:33.120 --> 38:36.710
Hey, Mom, it's me.

38:36.710 --> 38:38.920
You were right.

38:38.920 --> 38:41.750
Maybe it's time
for a fresh start.

38:41.750 --> 38:44.710
Give me a call whenever
you get this and we'll...

38:44.710 --> 38:46.210
we'll chat.

38:47.920 --> 38:52.170
Thank you for getting me
across the finish line.

38:52.170 --> 38:56.670
But when I am better,
I'm going to destroy you.

38:56.670 --> 38:59.080
More trash talk?

38:59.080 --> 39:01.540
Yes.
You are a little beast.

39:10.170 --> 39:12.540
Katherine.
What's going on?

39:12.540 --> 39:15.380
Katherine:
Someone's been making payments
to Jon's loan since he died.

39:15.380 --> 39:17.420
I traced the money back
to the source account.

39:17.420 --> 39:19.420
You won't believe
who authorized the transfers.

39:19.420 --> 39:22.040
Ashley?
Are you sure about that?

39:22.040 --> 39:24.040
I'm looking
at the account right now.

39:24.040 --> 39:25.710
Rutledge Trust.
The signatory --

39:25.710 --> 39:27.540
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What did you say?

39:27.540 --> 39:30.120
Jon: You know,
if we survive this,

39:30.120 --> 39:32.210
we should all go in
on Bruins season tickets.

39:32.210 --> 39:33.210
I'm in.

39:34.290 --> 39:35.290
Alright.

39:35.290 --> 39:36.380
Gary?

39:36.380 --> 39:41.210
It's never gonna happen,
but sure.

39:41.210 --> 39:42.750
Oh, of course,
if we don't survive this,

39:42.750 --> 39:45.960
then somebody needs to
tell this Rutledge guy

39:45.960 --> 39:47.540
to take care of my family.

39:48.960 --> 39:51.750
Gary, are you there?

39:51.750 --> 39:54.120
Does Rutledge
mean something to you?

39:54.120 --> 39:56.710
Yeah, uh, ever since
that day in the elevator,

39:56.710 --> 39:58.330
we always joked
that if something happened

39:58.330 --> 40:00.790
to one of us...
Rutledge --

40:00.790 --> 40:02.330
It was a term we came up
with -- a-a shorthand.

40:02.330 --> 40:03.500
For what?

40:03.500 --> 40:05.580
Take care of my family.

40:05.580 --> 40:08.080
I know where she is.
I'll text you the address.

40:18.750 --> 40:21.500
That's the one.
That's the apartment.

40:21.500 --> 40:23.750
You've been here?

40:23.750 --> 40:24.920
