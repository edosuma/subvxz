00:02.800 --> 00:04.120
<i>Previously on</i> East New York...
We've increased the number

00:04.320 --> 00:05.180
of patrol cars.

00:05.380 --> 00:07.320
Cars don't do us any good.

00:07.520 --> 00:08.850
We're also putting more cops
on foot posts.

00:09.050 --> 00:10.220
SHARKY:
All due respect,

00:10.420 --> 00:12.430
seeing five officers
reading their phones

00:12.630 --> 00:13.790
on a street corner
don't make us feel safe.

00:13.990 --> 00:15.060
If you want to know
how I'm doing,

00:15.260 --> 00:16.160
you should ask me.

00:16.360 --> 00:17.760
I do ask you, all the time.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.800
I don't want to be asked
all the time.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.340
QUINLAN: <i>What can I do?</i>
BENTLEY: <i>Nothing.</i>

00:22.540 --> 00:23.500
You know, some of us
work regular hours.

00:23.700 --> 00:24.920
That means you have
your nights fee.

00:27.860 --> 00:28.840
Um, I got to go.

00:29.040 --> 00:30.380
QUINLAN:
<i>My mother was arrested</i>

00:30.580 --> 00:32.050
for drug possession
for the fourth time.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.050
I guess you could say

00:33.250 --> 00:34.550
it left a mark.

00:34.750 --> 00:36.880
Pastrami on rye from Gottlieb's.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.450
Bon app√©tit.
CORINNE: <i>This isn't about him.</i>

00:38.650 --> 00:39.850
<i>It's about you.</i>

00:40.050 --> 00:41.020
<i>The only reason you had</i>

00:41.220 --> 00:42.090
for dragging him out of here is

00:42.290 --> 00:43.220
that you wanted to be right.

00:43.420 --> 00:44.460
You're a bully, Tommy.

00:44.660 --> 00:45.690
I don't want to be with you
anymore.

00:45.890 --> 00:48.190
Your brother's church is
being sold.

00:48.390 --> 00:50.700
Compel the sale of that church
to go forward,

00:50.900 --> 00:52.430
and you're gonna have detectives

00:52.630 --> 00:54.770
from Brooklyn North to Manhattan
watching your every move.

00:54.970 --> 00:56.050
All right, Chief.

00:58.420 --> 01:00.770
* We don't pretend no more *

01:00.970 --> 01:04.360
* We don't got minutes to spend
no more... *

01:05.630 --> 01:09.350
(indistinct chatter)

01:09.550 --> 01:11.050
* Almost put a hold on rap *

01:11.250 --> 01:12.720
* But they need
that new Saint Holy *

01:12.920 --> 01:14.650
* The little big homie... *

01:14.850 --> 01:17.020
Okay, I get it, I know.
But keep it peaceful, all right?

01:17.220 --> 01:18.390
Okay? All right?

01:18.590 --> 01:21.360
(clamoring)

01:21.560 --> 01:23.060
WOMAN:
Leave our streets alone!

01:23.260 --> 01:24.460
* 'Cause they don't trust
the police *

01:24.660 --> 01:26.600
* We don't pretend no more *

01:26.800 --> 01:29.840
* We don't got minutes to spend
no more... *

01:30.040 --> 01:31.400
Did you know him?

01:31.600 --> 01:32.870
It's Marcus Powell.

01:33.070 --> 01:34.440
He was one of
the last two hold-outs.

01:34.640 --> 01:36.010
He decided he wasn't selling

01:36.210 --> 01:38.480
and he'd make himself as much
a pain in the ass as possible.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.310
AYERS:
You two cops?

01:40.510 --> 01:42.780
Uh, yes,
Councilwoman Ayers.

01:42.980 --> 01:45.380
Detective Killian,
Detective Morales.

01:45.580 --> 01:46.750
This ought to be good.

01:46.950 --> 01:48.450
Best make sure
those storm troopers

01:48.650 --> 01:50.360
don't make off
with any evidence.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.430
I'm not a storm trooper,
Ms. Ayers.

01:52.630 --> 01:53.890
I'm just trying to do my job.

01:54.090 --> 01:55.160
You're part of a whole

01:55.360 --> 01:57.130
engine of displacement

01:57.330 --> 01:59.370
forcing our people
out of their homes.
SANDEFORD: Ms. Ayers,

01:59.570 --> 02:01.130
I'm gonna have to ask you
to step on this side

02:01.330 --> 02:03.600
of the tape, please,
thank you.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.970
It is every day
with these people

02:06.170 --> 02:07.770
trying to stop construction.

02:07.970 --> 02:09.480
Did you know Marcus Powell?

02:09.680 --> 02:11.340
I most certainly did know him.

02:11.540 --> 02:12.550
He was a righteous man

02:12.750 --> 02:13.780
and a courageous man.

02:13.980 --> 02:15.350
That's why they got rid of him.

02:15.550 --> 02:16.650
Who got rid of him?

02:16.850 --> 02:19.220
Who are the change agents
in East New York?

02:19.420 --> 02:21.890
Who's doing the gentrifying?

02:22.090 --> 02:23.920
Are you aware of
any actual dispute

02:24.120 --> 02:25.360
Mr. Powell was in?

02:25.560 --> 02:27.290
All day and every day,
young lady.

02:27.490 --> 02:28.560
All day and every day.

02:28.760 --> 02:30.130
We don't want you here!
Get out!

02:30.330 --> 02:31.500
Oh, look out!

02:31.700 --> 02:33.400
SANDEFORD:
Hey! You with the yellow cap!

02:33.600 --> 02:35.800
(clamoring)
WOMAN: Gentrification...

02:36.000 --> 02:37.400
(shouting)

02:37.600 --> 02:40.040
No! No violence.

02:40.240 --> 02:41.140
Stay calm, stay calm.

02:41.340 --> 02:42.940
MAN:
We live here.

02:43.140 --> 02:45.410
(clamoring continues)

02:45.610 --> 02:47.150
All right.
Where is he?

02:47.350 --> 02:48.850
Come with me.

02:49.050 --> 02:50.880
Detectives.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.990
This is Marcus's widow
and their neighbor Byron.

02:53.190 --> 02:55.390
Where is he?
She wants to see her husband

02:55.590 --> 02:56.660
before they take him away.
MORALES: I'm sorry,

02:56.860 --> 02:58.190
now wouldn't be
the time for that.

02:58.390 --> 03:00.160
Oh, come on.
Just give her a moment.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.090
Okay, I'm sorry...
(gasps)

03:02.300 --> 03:03.910
Marcus!

03:05.110 --> 03:06.670
No! Marcus!

03:06.870 --> 03:08.500
Marcus!
Okay, come on, come on.

03:08.700 --> 03:10.740
BYRON:
Come on, come on. Be strong.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.560
(crying)
Be strong. Be strong.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.880
JAKE: You in charge here?
Yes.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.710
Is there any chance we could
at least get started trenching?

03:19.910 --> 03:22.480
As long as this is
a crime scene, you can't.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.650
(exhales sharply)

03:24.850 --> 03:26.550
This is what they do to us.

03:26.750 --> 03:28.890
They drive us wild with grief

03:29.090 --> 03:31.460
while you and your officers
stand guard.

03:31.660 --> 03:33.360
Councilwoman,
I need you to stand

03:33.560 --> 03:35.460
on the other side
of the tape, okay?

03:35.660 --> 03:37.810
Please.

03:47.460 --> 03:48.990
Hey.

03:50.190 --> 03:51.440
Wrap some fence up
around where the body is

03:51.640 --> 03:52.580
and get to work.

03:52.780 --> 03:54.010
The cops said not to.
Who?

03:54.210 --> 03:55.210
Which cop?
Me.

03:55.410 --> 03:57.780
(chuckles):
Oh, Inspector Haywood.

03:57.980 --> 03:59.180
Forgive me,
I didn't see you.

03:59.390 --> 04:01.250
Another Lustig building,
another dead body.

04:01.450 --> 04:02.520
That is four I know of.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.120
You have a rooting interest

04:04.320 --> 04:05.860
in me being guilty of something,
don't you?

04:06.060 --> 04:08.360
I have a rooting interest
in people being held accountable

04:08.560 --> 04:09.800
for their actions.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.600
This is what
I'm accountable for, Inspector.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.200
What I create.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.300
Places for people to live,

04:15.500 --> 04:16.540
raising families.

04:16.740 --> 04:18.470
I create jobs.

04:18.670 --> 04:19.610
I don't want
your workers on-site

04:19.810 --> 04:20.810
until we wrap up
our investigation.

04:21.010 --> 04:22.280
What, you're gonna push me out?

04:22.480 --> 04:23.610
Like your boss Chief Suarez did?

04:23.810 --> 04:25.180
I don't know
what you're talking about.

04:25.380 --> 04:27.650
Well, he decided that
a project of mine was, um,

04:27.850 --> 04:28.950
not to his liking,

04:29.150 --> 04:30.920
so he assumed the power
of a despot

04:31.120 --> 04:33.090
and convinced me--
for the sake of expediency

04:33.290 --> 04:36.120
and my own personal safety--
that I abandon that project.

04:36.320 --> 04:37.360
Well...

04:37.560 --> 04:39.590
I won't be abandoning this one.

04:39.790 --> 04:42.710
* *

04:57.160 --> 04:59.260
(De Staat's "Who's Gonna Be
the GOAT?" playing)

05:04.170 --> 05:07.220
* Who's gonna be the GOAT?
Not me *

05:07.420 --> 05:08.650
* Ain't gonna train
for the UFC *

05:08.850 --> 05:10.890
* You're protein shaking
the money tree *

05:11.090 --> 05:13.290
* On a 12-step plan
to meet Jay-Z *

05:13.490 --> 05:16.430
* You're busy, busy bees,
I'm free *

05:16.630 --> 05:18.200
* Resisting, whistling
"J'aime la vie" *

05:18.400 --> 05:20.670
* You have a dream,
I get sleep *

05:20.870 --> 05:23.340
* I guess the best... *
What, are you stalking me now?

05:23.540 --> 05:25.770
Mm. It seems that way,
doesn't it?

05:25.970 --> 05:27.210
* Who's gonna be the GOAT? *

05:27.410 --> 05:29.910
I know I haven't returned
your calls or texts...

05:30.110 --> 05:31.380
Mm. What's going on?

05:31.580 --> 05:33.480
I like you, Sean, I do, really.

05:33.680 --> 05:34.780
Um...
But?

05:34.980 --> 05:37.680
I don't know
if I'm ready to get serious.

05:37.880 --> 05:38.850
I'm not just serious.

05:39.050 --> 05:41.250
I can also be funny.
Stop.

05:41.450 --> 05:42.520
Hey, these things don't
always keep.

05:42.720 --> 05:43.920
I didn't have a timetable
when we met,

05:44.120 --> 05:45.320
I don't have a timetable now.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.130
I just don't want us
to miss our moment, you know?

05:47.330 --> 05:49.730
I don't want to look back
and feel like it's passed.

05:49.930 --> 05:52.230
I don't want that, either.

05:52.430 --> 05:55.130
I'm sorry
for disappearing on you.

05:55.330 --> 05:56.870
But I do, I...

05:57.070 --> 05:59.410
I have to get back inside
right now.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.010
Yeah, I got you.

06:01.210 --> 06:02.760
Here you are.

06:04.260 --> 06:06.140
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

06:06.340 --> 06:07.410
Have a good day.
You, too.

06:07.610 --> 06:09.400
* Who's gonna be the GOAT? *

06:11.100 --> 06:14.500
* Who's gonna be the GOAT? *
(indistinct chatter)

06:15.640 --> 06:17.020
Keep it moving, come on.

06:17.220 --> 06:19.390
Hey, can I just, like,
talk to you for a sec?

06:19.590 --> 06:21.030
Yeah.

06:21.230 --> 06:23.560
So, I-I meant to call you
last night,

06:23.760 --> 06:24.660
but it was kind of late

06:24.860 --> 06:26.130
when I got back
from track practice.

06:26.330 --> 06:28.070
Yeah, it-it's okay.

06:28.270 --> 06:31.300
Are you mad at me?

06:31.500 --> 06:35.010
I'm just...
Honestly, I'm mad at myself.

06:35.210 --> 06:36.380
Why?

06:36.580 --> 06:37.940
'Cause I waited for you to call.

06:38.140 --> 06:40.580
Uh... I'm sorry.

06:40.780 --> 06:42.620
No, I don't,
I don't want you to be sorry.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.220
Okay? And I don't want
to be angry, but most of all,

06:44.420 --> 06:46.100
I just,
I don't want to keep waiting.

06:47.570 --> 06:49.320
Look, I...

06:49.520 --> 06:51.060
I think that
we got hot and heavy

06:51.260 --> 06:53.160
a little too quick,

06:53.360 --> 06:56.460
and I need us
to take a step back.

06:56.660 --> 06:58.360
Uh, I hate that.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.670
I'm not saying that we're not
gonna start back up again,

07:01.870 --> 07:03.700
but, Andre,
you've got a lot going on,

07:03.900 --> 07:05.270
and I don't think

07:05.470 --> 07:08.360
it's good for either one of us
to be involved right now.

07:10.590 --> 07:12.730
Okay.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.430
Okay.

07:21.070 --> 07:23.310
* *

07:27.880 --> 07:29.800
Front page of
the <i>New York Post.</i>

07:30.000 --> 07:30.800
I know.

07:31.000 --> 07:31.930
Stabbing on the subway.

07:32.130 --> 07:34.100
"Crime on
Public Transportation,"

07:34.300 --> 07:36.200
leads every time,
which is why this election

07:36.400 --> 07:37.940
will be won or lost

07:38.140 --> 07:39.300
on people's perception...

07:39.500 --> 07:41.440
Thanks.
...on who will be

07:41.640 --> 07:43.380
the most likely
to keep them safe.

07:43.580 --> 07:46.010
Which will allow me to speak
to why it is

07:46.210 --> 07:47.410
some locations
are violence-prone

07:47.610 --> 07:49.310
and how a high-visibility
police presence

07:49.510 --> 07:51.050
can best address that.
SUAREZ: All right.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.390
So, Brooklyn North is

07:53.590 --> 07:55.950
composed of ten
different precincts.

07:56.150 --> 07:58.160
And I'd be happy to have someone

07:58.360 --> 08:00.160
give you a breakdown
of all the statistics.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.290
Uh, that would be
immensely helpful.

08:02.490 --> 08:05.780
Not as helpful as being
in the car with you.

08:07.520 --> 08:08.870
SUAREZ:
Well, I don't think

08:09.070 --> 08:11.540
you're gonna find riding
in the car all that interesting.

08:11.740 --> 08:15.320
If I get bored,
you can drop me off.

08:16.790 --> 08:18.830
* *

08:24.800 --> 08:28.320
My father-in-law bought
this place in 1958.

08:28.520 --> 08:30.890
He worked
at the Navy Yard,

08:31.090 --> 08:34.360
saved up, and when no bank
would give him a mortgage,

08:34.560 --> 08:37.050
he managed to buy it
for cash.

08:38.010 --> 08:39.830
Understandable that your husband
didn't want to sell.

08:40.030 --> 08:41.700
And were there any threats
made against your husband

08:41.900 --> 08:42.970
if he wouldn't sell?

08:43.170 --> 08:45.270
No one who knew him
would've bothered.

08:45.470 --> 08:47.070
Ah, he didn't scare easily?

08:47.270 --> 08:48.740
He didn't scare period.

08:48.940 --> 08:53.550
He had principles and beliefs,
and that's what he lived by.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.280
The preliminary report
from the medical examiner

08:56.480 --> 08:58.750
puts your husband's
time of death

08:58.950 --> 09:00.190
at between 10:00 and midnight.

09:00.390 --> 09:01.920
Were you home at that time?

09:02.120 --> 09:04.190
I had gone out to dinner

09:04.390 --> 09:05.760
with my neighbor Byron.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.030
Probably...

09:07.230 --> 09:08.530
got home around 8:30.

09:08.730 --> 09:10.530
And did you see your husband
after you got home?

09:10.730 --> 09:11.830
Uh-huh.

09:12.030 --> 09:15.930
He was sitting
in this big corduroy chair

09:16.130 --> 09:17.370
he liked to sit in.

09:17.570 --> 09:19.170
Uh, he was reading <i>The Guardian.</i>

09:19.370 --> 09:21.320
And was that the last time
you saw him?

09:22.290 --> 09:24.910
I went to sleep around 9:00.

09:25.110 --> 09:28.110
The next thing I knew,
it was early morning

09:28.310 --> 09:31.150
and, uh,
cops were knocking at my door.

09:31.350 --> 09:32.990
MORALES:
Do you have any idea
why your husband

09:33.190 --> 09:34.450
would go out at that hour?

09:34.650 --> 09:37.360
The developer was trying
to drive us out.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.690
He would bring junkies

09:39.890 --> 09:42.760
and mentally ill people
to camp out

09:42.960 --> 09:44.200
on our doorstep.

09:44.400 --> 09:47.300
Marcus might've gone out
to try to reason with them.

09:47.500 --> 09:49.400
I mean, he'd never blame them
for being there.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.040
Instead he'd...

09:51.240 --> 09:53.310
bring them food

09:53.510 --> 09:56.290
and talk to them
about Karl Marx.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.680
YENKO:
Victim's name was Marcus Powell.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.710
HAYWOOD: And this was his house?
Yeah.

10:01.910 --> 10:04.750
One of the founders of
the East New York Food Co-op.

10:04.950 --> 10:07.150
One of the founders of
the People's Free Clinic.

10:07.350 --> 10:08.750
Arrested in 2020,

10:08.950 --> 10:12.240
following the social justice
demonstrations.

10:15.210 --> 10:16.860
Uh, I think you might want to

10:17.060 --> 10:18.860
take a look at
my husband's journal.

10:19.060 --> 10:21.350
Yes, we would.
Thank you.

10:26.990 --> 10:29.070
(yawns)

10:29.270 --> 10:30.710
How much sleep are you getting,

10:30.910 --> 10:32.880
staying up all night,
doing two jobs?

10:33.080 --> 10:34.210
I'm getting enough.

10:34.410 --> 10:35.680
Really?
Yeah, you know,

10:35.880 --> 10:37.420
Martha Stewart gets by
on three hours a night.

10:37.620 --> 10:38.450
That's a good role model
for you.

10:38.650 --> 10:39.520
Maybe in your spare time

10:39.720 --> 10:40.720
you can learn cake decorating.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.420
HAYWOOD:
Hey.

10:42.620 --> 10:43.890
What are we thinking?

10:44.090 --> 10:47.530
Well, this guy was something of
an activist, you know,

10:47.730 --> 10:48.860
so I'm wondering if that
didn't have something to do

10:49.060 --> 10:50.130
with him killed.
Mm-mm.

10:50.330 --> 10:51.830
There's a fair amount of theft

10:52.030 --> 10:53.530
in this construction site.

10:53.730 --> 10:54.670
That might be
a more likely connection.

10:54.870 --> 10:56.300
YENKO:
You'd like Lustig

10:56.500 --> 10:57.940
to have something to do
with this, wouldn't you?

10:58.140 --> 11:00.310
Nothing will convince me
he didn't have something to do

11:00.510 --> 11:01.970
with a homicide related to

11:02.170 --> 11:03.780
one of his projects
in the past.

11:03.980 --> 11:05.910
Someone stands in his way
of him getting what he wants,

11:06.110 --> 11:07.650
he has them taken out.

11:07.850 --> 11:09.720
Um...

11:09.920 --> 11:12.000
He wrote in this journal
every day.

11:12.870 --> 11:16.190
Uh, here's the date and time
that Lustig visited the site

11:16.390 --> 11:17.960
and Marcus confronted him.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.360
MORALES:
"Lustig said

11:19.560 --> 11:21.260
"he could have me killed
for less than

11:21.460 --> 11:23.760
what he's paying for Sheetrock."

11:23.960 --> 11:26.680
* *

11:29.580 --> 11:31.140
So, getting your
sector cars out,

11:31.340 --> 11:32.710
that's your first priority.

11:32.910 --> 11:36.170
Then you-you have to take care
of your-your hospitals posts,

11:36.370 --> 11:38.140
your emotionally disturbed
persons.

11:38.340 --> 11:39.980
Your DOA's.

11:40.180 --> 11:41.780
And if the personnel
were available,

11:41.980 --> 11:43.680
you'd deploy those cops
on foot posts.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.650
Where do we stand
on solo foot posts?

11:45.850 --> 11:48.690
Solo? We put them on hold.

11:48.890 --> 11:50.890
For the time being.
I think that's wise.

11:51.090 --> 11:53.790
When it comes to police unions,
we have to pick our battles.

11:53.990 --> 11:55.840
Hmm.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.650
(brakes squeal lightly)

12:00.480 --> 12:01.880
Pull over, please.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.510
ALLISON:
Everything okay?

12:09.710 --> 12:11.790
Will you give me a minute?

12:13.300 --> 12:14.480
(phone chimes)

12:14.680 --> 12:17.080
(indistinct chatter)

12:17.280 --> 12:18.220
What's going on, guys?

12:18.420 --> 12:20.390
Coffee klatch?
OFFICERS: Chief.

12:20.590 --> 12:22.720
Put that phone away.
So, what?

12:22.920 --> 12:24.860
Your patrol sergeant's already
been by, and you figured

12:25.060 --> 12:26.120
you got the rest
of the day off?

12:26.320 --> 12:28.060
'Cause you don't.
No, sir.

12:28.260 --> 12:29.440
Chief.

12:30.710 --> 12:31.930
Hey.
We're handing out
crime prevention flyers

12:32.130 --> 12:33.730
to various merchants
in the neighborhood.

12:33.930 --> 12:35.670
All of you?
Yes, sir.

12:35.870 --> 12:37.050
Had that not been approved
by the Borough?

12:38.220 --> 12:39.200
No, no. It has.

12:39.400 --> 12:40.970
Carry on. Yeah.

12:41.170 --> 12:42.370
How you feeling? Good.
I'm feeling all right.
How you feeling?

12:42.570 --> 12:44.830
(phone chimes)

12:58.470 --> 12:59.880
Hey.

13:00.710 --> 13:01.940
Hey.

13:02.640 --> 13:04.230
Hey.

13:04.430 --> 13:05.730
I wanted to drop off
my apartment key

13:05.930 --> 13:07.150
and my share of the rent.

13:08.380 --> 13:11.170
That's... that's really
not necessary, Corinne.

13:11.370 --> 13:13.470
Yeah, it is.
Hey, hey, hey.

13:13.670 --> 13:14.570
Look...

13:14.770 --> 13:17.140
Hey, how's-how's the bar doing?

13:17.340 --> 13:19.380
Not great.
Also, not your problem.

13:19.580 --> 13:22.410
(laughs):
What do you mean? It's...

13:22.610 --> 13:23.650
How is it not my problem?

13:23.850 --> 13:25.050
I mean, I'm still
your business partner.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.550
Your name's not on the lease.

13:26.750 --> 13:29.150
It's not on the state
liquor authority license.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.640
You don't have
any obligations at all.

13:34.340 --> 13:36.380
Like we never even
knew each other.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.500
I'll see ya.

13:39.700 --> 13:42.520
* *

13:44.850 --> 13:47.060
I'll see ya.

13:54.530 --> 13:56.180
QUINLAN:
<i>Aziz, it's not gonna happen.</i>

13:56.380 --> 13:58.050
AZIZ:
<i>Why wouldn't it?</i>

13:58.250 --> 13:59.320
Because they don't make cops

13:59.520 --> 14:01.250
with three years on the job
detectives.

14:01.450 --> 14:04.990
Not unless you have a rabbi
and that rabbi has pull.

14:05.190 --> 14:06.830
You have Haywood, right?

14:07.030 --> 14:08.060
I don't know who I have.

14:08.260 --> 14:09.560
DISPATCHER (over radio):
7-4, Post 3.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.700
Need an 8-5, no emergency,
at Atlantic and Shepherd.

14:11.900 --> 14:12.930
(phone ringing)

14:13.130 --> 14:14.370
AZIZ:
7-4, sector B, we got it.

14:14.570 --> 14:15.570
Hello?

14:15.770 --> 14:17.670
ANN-MARIE (over phone):
Hey, baby.

14:17.870 --> 14:18.900
Hey, Ma.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.270
How are you?

14:20.470 --> 14:21.570
I'm-I'm good. I'm at work.

14:21.770 --> 14:23.980
You're still happy living
in that place?

14:24.180 --> 14:25.940
You know, Ma, I'm...

14:26.140 --> 14:28.050
I'm not all that happy
right now.

14:28.250 --> 14:29.480
Hmm. What's that about?

14:29.680 --> 14:32.180
I don't know, I-I can't really
get into it right now.

14:32.380 --> 14:34.220
Uh, how are, how are things
going with you?

14:34.420 --> 14:36.090
I-I don't, I don't like
the way you sound, Brandy.

14:36.290 --> 14:37.760
QUINLAN:
Hey, hey, Ma, I got to go.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.370
Okay? I-I'll talk to you soon.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.580
(doors open)

14:48.120 --> 14:50.720
We just got 10-2'd
to the house.
(doors close)

14:55.020 --> 14:57.160
How's it going?

14:58.730 --> 15:00.600
Good.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.420
NEWSWOMAN (on video):
<i>Police officers in the 7-4</i>

15:07.620 --> 15:09.890
were interrupted
by Chief John Suarez today

15:10.090 --> 15:12.390
while drinking coffee and
playing on their cell phones.

15:12.590 --> 15:14.090
(video continues indistinctly)
Doesn't look too good, does it?

15:14.290 --> 15:16.390
Marvin, this,
never supposed to happen.

15:16.590 --> 15:17.800
Why did it?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.230
A consultant to Raymond Sharpe
was in the car.

15:20.430 --> 15:22.470
Without my knowledge,
she, uh, made a recording

15:22.670 --> 15:26.100
of cops being derelict
and me stopping it.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.210
Apparently, they put it up
on, uh, Sharpe's website,

15:29.410 --> 15:31.180
which they've taken it down

15:31.380 --> 15:33.600
at my insistence.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.820
Hey, if I had seen it was you,

15:39.020 --> 15:40.590
I would've figured whatever
you were doing was legit.

15:40.790 --> 15:42.570
Listen,
it's no big thing, Chief.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.540
Really.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.430
SUAREZ:
Eh.

15:50.630 --> 15:53.070
Well, that won't be happening
again.

15:53.270 --> 15:55.230
I'm sure you didn't intend it
to happen this time, Chief.

15:55.430 --> 15:56.630
No, I definitely didn't.

15:56.830 --> 15:59.420
Seems as though it was
out of your control.

16:01.290 --> 16:03.290
Doesn't excuse it.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.350
(knocks)

16:07.550 --> 16:09.180
One of the workers
at the construction site

16:09.380 --> 16:12.680
said he recognized a guy
named Ochoa casing the place.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.290
Said he told Lustig,

16:14.490 --> 16:15.890
and Lustig didn't want to
do anything about it.

16:16.090 --> 16:17.190
Lustig might've been using

16:17.390 --> 16:18.890
Ochoa to do his dirty work.

16:19.090 --> 16:22.460
Let all the sector cars know,
I want this Ochoa brought in.

16:22.660 --> 16:23.930
Mm-hmm.

16:24.130 --> 16:26.750
* *

16:32.890 --> 16:34.340
SANDEFORD:
Ochoa works the black market.

16:34.540 --> 16:36.270
Sometimes they sell stolen goods
here.

16:36.470 --> 16:38.310
Hey, s-stop right over here.

16:38.510 --> 16:40.860
I'm gonna go and talk to my guy
in the office for a minute.

16:42.430 --> 16:44.370
(indistinct chatter)

16:45.970 --> 16:46.920
That's Ochoa!

16:47.120 --> 16:48.870
(tires screech)

16:50.310 --> 16:51.970
(tires screeching)

16:52.810 --> 16:54.740
(beeping)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

16:56.810 --> 16:58.680
(engine revving)

17:04.820 --> 17:06.140
(groans)

17:06.340 --> 17:07.590
Keep your hands on
the steering wheel, don't move.

17:08.490 --> 17:10.210
Got him.

17:10.410 --> 17:11.440
Get out of the car!

17:11.640 --> 17:12.680
Get out of the car!
Step out.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.150
Hey, what did I do?

17:14.350 --> 17:16.150
Gonna let you chat with
the detectives about that.

17:16.350 --> 17:18.770
Right.
(cuffs clicking)

17:20.200 --> 17:21.920
Nice driving, young man.

17:22.120 --> 17:23.640
I like cars.

17:28.340 --> 17:30.580
* *

17:31.750 --> 17:33.000
So, what was your arrangement
with Adam Lustig?

17:33.200 --> 17:34.570
I don't have an arrangement.

17:34.770 --> 17:36.700
MORALES (over comm):
We have you on felony possession

17:36.900 --> 17:38.070
of stolen property,

17:38.270 --> 17:39.800
which we don't much care about
one way or the other.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.670
What we do care about is
the murder of Marcus Powell.

17:42.870 --> 17:45.580
Whoa, I don't know
anything about that.

17:45.780 --> 17:47.610
(sighs heavily)

17:47.810 --> 17:50.480
Is it possible you're
being set up, Louis?

17:50.680 --> 17:51.820
By who?

17:52.020 --> 17:53.450
Whoever beat Marcus Powell
to death maybe.

17:53.650 --> 17:56.090
Unless that was you.
All right, look, man.

17:56.290 --> 17:57.360
I'm a thief.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.860
Copper pipe, plywood,

17:59.060 --> 18:02.060
windows and doors, whatever
I can haul off and sell.

18:02.260 --> 18:03.730
What'd he have with him
in his truck

18:03.930 --> 18:06.060
when Sandeford and Bentley
brought him in?

18:06.260 --> 18:07.600
"22 pieces of straight

18:07.800 --> 18:09.830
"three-inch copper pipe,
eight copper elbows,

18:10.030 --> 18:11.170
ten five-gallon buckets..."

18:11.370 --> 18:12.800
"...of joint compound,
dozen sheets

18:13.000 --> 18:15.840
"of half-inch plywood,
one bundle of

18:16.040 --> 18:19.240
25 collapsed cardboard cartons."

18:19.440 --> 18:20.850
Where did you get
the cardboard cartons from?

18:21.050 --> 18:24.750
That's not something you usually
find at a construction site.

18:24.950 --> 18:26.550
They were outside the front door
of one of the houses.

18:26.750 --> 18:29.790
You usually buy bundles of
cardboard cartons

18:29.990 --> 18:31.090
when you're moving.

18:31.290 --> 18:32.860
So, then maybe one of
the hold-outs was

18:33.060 --> 18:35.190
actually planning on moving.

18:35.390 --> 18:37.560
According to
the shipping labels,

18:37.760 --> 18:39.430
the cardboard cartons
were ordered from Uline

18:39.630 --> 18:41.830
by Marcus Powell's neighbor,
Byron Rice.

18:42.030 --> 18:43.370
KILLIAN:
And when we questioned him
at the crime scene,

18:43.570 --> 18:45.400
he made it sound like
he and Marcus Powell

18:45.600 --> 18:46.800
were dead set against moving.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.470
You know, they were both
born in East New York.

18:48.670 --> 18:49.810
East New York was
where they'd die.

18:50.010 --> 18:52.110
Powell made good on that.

18:52.310 --> 18:53.650
If Rice was planning on moving,

18:53.850 --> 18:55.910
I'd like to know
whether Adam Lustig

18:56.110 --> 18:57.900
had anything to do
with it.

19:00.070 --> 19:02.300
* *

19:04.640 --> 19:06.160
<i>(elevator bell dings)</i>

19:06.360 --> 19:07.530
Did it ever occur to you

19:07.730 --> 19:08.990
to simply ask
for any relevant material?

19:09.190 --> 19:10.430
KILLIAN: Not really.
LUSTIG: No, of course not.

19:10.630 --> 19:12.000
It's so much more satisfying

19:12.200 --> 19:14.600
to strong-arm someone,
even though I would've happily

19:14.800 --> 19:17.800
given you what you were
entitled to, voluntarily.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.440
Sometimes there's
a discrepancy

19:19.640 --> 19:21.470
between what you think
we're entitled to

19:21.670 --> 19:22.670
and what we think
we're entitled to.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.310
Uh-huh.
The warrant spells it out.

19:24.510 --> 19:26.080
Well, I'm gonna spell
something else out.

19:26.280 --> 19:27.550
Anything privileged

19:27.750 --> 19:29.610
or covered by
nondisclosure agreements leaks,

19:29.810 --> 19:33.270
I will hold you two responsible,
personally.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.460
Straight down to
the loading dock, guys.

19:37.660 --> 19:40.440
(indistinct chatter)

19:41.610 --> 19:42.530
Oh, getting famous, Marvin.

19:42.730 --> 19:44.300
Oh, yeah? How's that?

19:44.500 --> 19:45.530
Logged on to Facebook,
and there you were.

19:45.730 --> 19:46.960
Hey, hey, come on.
I wasn't expecting

19:47.160 --> 19:48.570
to see you holding hands
with a bunch of rookies

19:48.770 --> 19:50.000
on the corner.
You don't know a damn thing

19:50.200 --> 19:51.570
about what was happening
on that corner, do you?

19:51.770 --> 19:52.800
Do you?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.720
It's not worth it, Marvin.
It's not worth it.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.660
You're an idiot.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.600
(knocking)

20:06.470 --> 20:07.820
Do I need an appointment?

20:08.020 --> 20:10.720
Since you don't have one,
why don't you just come in.

20:10.920 --> 20:13.360
I understand you have
a person of interest

20:13.560 --> 20:15.760
in the killing of Marcus Powell.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.360
I'm not at liberty
to discuss that,

20:17.560 --> 20:19.030
Councilwoman.

20:19.230 --> 20:20.770
A community organizer

20:20.970 --> 20:21.970
is murdered.

20:22.170 --> 20:23.500
You don't go after

20:23.700 --> 20:26.270
the people of
prestige and power

20:26.470 --> 20:28.710
who have every reason
to murder him.

20:28.910 --> 20:29.810
Instead,

20:30.010 --> 20:31.710
you go after
the property thief.

20:31.910 --> 20:35.180
That way you can wrap up
your investigation,

20:35.380 --> 20:37.380
and nobody will be mad at you.

20:37.580 --> 20:39.480
Are you suggesting
I'd have someone charged

20:39.680 --> 20:41.990
with a crime
I knew he didn't commit?

20:42.190 --> 20:45.010
I'm not saying
you'd do it knowingly.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.260
I'm saying it happens.

20:47.460 --> 20:49.430
And I do everything
within my power

20:49.630 --> 20:50.830
to prevent it from happening.

20:51.030 --> 20:54.670
There are forces arrayed
against us, Inspector.

20:54.870 --> 20:59.000
The man who was killed
stood in the way,

20:59.200 --> 21:00.470
and nothing will convince me

21:00.670 --> 21:03.440
it's not what got him killed.

21:03.640 --> 21:05.240
I don't say this
with any disrespect,

21:05.440 --> 21:06.610
Councilwoman.

21:06.810 --> 21:09.810
You're a politician,
I'm a cop.

21:10.010 --> 21:12.980
I go where
the evidence leads me.

21:13.180 --> 21:15.870
I hope so.

21:18.270 --> 21:19.560
(knocking)
Come in.

21:19.760 --> 21:21.330
SHARPE:
Thank you.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.430
(chuckles softly)

21:23.630 --> 21:24.760
You're not returning my calls,
John?

21:24.960 --> 21:26.360
After what your consultant did,

21:26.560 --> 21:28.000
I'd say we're both better off
if I don't.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.270
She made a mistake.

21:29.470 --> 21:31.970
She held a cop
with 26 years on the job

21:32.170 --> 21:33.670
up to public ridicule,

21:33.870 --> 21:36.210
not to mention significantly
corrupting my authority.

21:36.410 --> 21:38.540
You know
we've been running focus groups.

21:38.740 --> 21:40.110
I don't care!

21:40.310 --> 21:41.810
(sighs)

21:42.010 --> 21:43.980
One of the things that
has been consistently viewed

21:44.180 --> 21:46.780
as negative
has been cops just hanging out

21:46.980 --> 21:48.950
in groups,
cops on their phones.

21:49.150 --> 21:50.790
I don't need a focus group
to tell me that, Raymond,

21:50.990 --> 21:52.390
any more than
I need a consultant

21:52.590 --> 21:54.740
to tell me how to do my job.

21:56.280 --> 21:57.810
Sorry.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.730
Do you know that Regina Haywood

22:02.930 --> 22:04.500
is going after
Adam Lustig again?

22:04.700 --> 22:05.840
You tell him to take it up

22:06.040 --> 22:07.270
with the Civilian
Complaint Review Board.

22:07.470 --> 22:09.110
(sighs) Okay, look.

22:09.310 --> 22:10.610
I get it.

22:10.810 --> 22:12.410
Now's not a good time
to be asking for anything,

22:12.610 --> 22:13.650
whether it's legit or not.

22:13.850 --> 22:15.450
And since you seem to feel

22:15.650 --> 22:17.450
that a grievous error
has been made,

22:17.650 --> 22:20.080
whether or not I agree with it,

22:20.280 --> 22:21.570
I'll make it right.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.640
* *

22:30.980 --> 22:32.180
(door closes)

22:38.020 --> 22:40.910
DR. SORENSON: What's going on
with your friend Sean?

22:41.110 --> 22:43.740
Oh, I, um, I talked to him
yesterday.

22:43.940 --> 22:46.830
You still thinking about
taking the next step?

22:48.600 --> 22:51.380
I am still thinking,
which is part of the problem,

22:51.580 --> 22:52.580
Dr. Sorenson.

22:52.780 --> 22:53.950
The more I think,
the more I worry.

22:54.150 --> 22:55.350
What are you worried about?

22:55.550 --> 22:58.820
I worry that he is not
who he seems to be.

22:59.020 --> 23:00.090
I...

23:00.290 --> 23:03.430
Do you worry that
you'll be hurt by that?

23:03.630 --> 23:05.430
I don't know about hurt,
I don't...

23:05.630 --> 23:06.830
I don't hurt all that easily.

23:07.030 --> 23:09.500
Your father managed to do
a pretty good job of it.

23:09.700 --> 23:11.800
I was a little younger then.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.470
So what's stopping you?

23:13.670 --> 23:16.510
Uh, stopping me from... what?

23:16.710 --> 23:18.210
Enjoying this guy's company.

23:18.410 --> 23:19.880
Oh.
Enjoying the sex.

23:20.080 --> 23:23.380
Allowing yourself to do
what gives you pleasure,

23:23.580 --> 23:25.800
without worrying.

23:30.770 --> 23:32.360
(chuckles)

23:32.560 --> 23:34.140
I don't know.

23:36.340 --> 23:39.380
(scoffs) I don't know.

23:40.480 --> 23:42.420
(sirens wailing)

23:44.050 --> 23:47.020
(indistinct chatter)

23:48.920 --> 23:50.580
QUINLAN:
Ma?

23:50.780 --> 23:52.180
What are you doing here?

23:52.380 --> 23:54.710
I didn't like the way you
sounded on the phone yesterday.

23:54.910 --> 23:56.480
Okay, well,
you could've just called.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.320
You didn't have to come here.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.880
I wanted to, okay?

24:00.080 --> 24:01.520
I mean, I just got on
the bus and came.

24:01.720 --> 24:04.970
The same way people show up
for me, I showed up for you.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.710
* *

24:15.220 --> 24:16.720
Thank you.

24:19.190 --> 24:20.340
So, you still living in Boston?

24:20.540 --> 24:22.740
I guess I never told you,

24:22.940 --> 24:25.380
I got this really cute place
in Fall River.

24:25.580 --> 24:27.230
You got to come up and see it.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.330
BENTLEY: Hey, hi.
Hey.

24:32.330 --> 24:34.690
Uh, this is Ann-Marie, my mom.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.050
This is Andre.

24:36.250 --> 24:37.250
Hey, Andre.

24:37.450 --> 24:38.290
Nice to meet you.

24:38.490 --> 24:39.770
Nice to meet you.

24:40.470 --> 24:41.880
(clears throat)

24:44.310 --> 24:45.360
He's handsome.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.160
So, what do you plan on doing

24:47.360 --> 24:48.830
while you're here?

24:49.030 --> 24:52.140
Uh, I just wanted to spend
some time with you.

24:52.340 --> 24:54.270
I work, Mom.
I work all day.

24:54.470 --> 24:56.260
I know. I know.

24:57.190 --> 24:58.510
So, what are you gonna do?

24:58.710 --> 25:01.010
(scoffs) I used to live
in New York, you know?

25:01.210 --> 25:02.650
Yeah.

25:02.850 --> 25:04.180
I know, that's what worries me.

25:04.380 --> 25:06.370
* *

25:07.270 --> 25:11.990
Phew. Wow. Lustig spent $8,000
at Bergdorf Goodman

25:12.190 --> 25:13.690
on one suit.
(scoffs)

25:13.890 --> 25:16.330
Ah, Lustig Pointe Capital, the
LLC developing this property,

25:16.530 --> 25:18.560
this is a list
of their relocation fees.

25:18.760 --> 25:21.000
I can't imagine what it's like
to spend eight grand on a suit.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.300
Lustig acquired the deeds

25:22.500 --> 25:24.200
to 14 brownstones,
which they demolished,

25:24.400 --> 25:26.500
and bought the leases
for 20 apartments,

25:26.700 --> 25:28.040
which they
also demolished.

25:28.240 --> 25:29.470
Hey. What do we know?

25:29.670 --> 25:30.780
According to these records,

25:30.980 --> 25:33.210
Lustig's LLC spent a million-six

25:33.410 --> 25:35.210
to get the tenants
and homeowners

25:35.410 --> 25:37.350
out of the buildings
he wanted to demolish

25:37.550 --> 25:38.680
to build
Lustig Towers.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.380
Even if it meant building around

25:40.580 --> 25:42.450
Marcus Powell's house
and building around

25:42.650 --> 25:43.690
Byron Rice's house.

25:43.890 --> 25:46.290
Also, there was a $50,000

25:46.490 --> 25:48.630
wire transfer
from Lustig's LLC account

25:48.830 --> 25:51.060
to Byron Rice's account.

25:51.260 --> 25:53.160
When was that?
Last week.

25:53.360 --> 25:55.800
Maybe Rice changed his mind
about selling.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.470
Guys, this may or may not
be of interest,

25:58.670 --> 26:01.970
Bettina Powell applied
for a real estate license

26:02.170 --> 26:03.840
in North Carolina
last month.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.440
How would you know that?

26:05.640 --> 26:07.180
Well, something popped out at me
when we were at the house.

26:07.380 --> 26:09.080
Their bookshelves
reflected

26:09.280 --> 26:11.350
two distinct
areas of interest.

26:11.550 --> 26:12.980
One, political books,

26:13.180 --> 26:14.820
<i>Autobiography</i>
<i>of Malcolm X,</i>

26:15.020 --> 26:16.350
<i>Rules for Radicals,</i>
that kind of thing.

26:16.550 --> 26:19.960
The other were workbooks
for real estate license exams.

26:20.160 --> 26:22.130
How did you know
it was in North Carolina?

26:22.330 --> 26:23.960
Well, you start close,
you expand outward.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.400
I was still on
the East Coast

26:25.600 --> 26:27.200
when I hit pay dirt.

26:27.400 --> 26:30.300
Byron Rice ordered cartons,
likely for moving.

26:30.500 --> 26:34.010
Bettina planned on moving
to North Carolina, so...

26:34.210 --> 26:36.270
We're on it.
HAYWOOD: Okay.

26:36.470 --> 26:38.530
Thanks, guys. Thanks.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.280
KILLIAN:
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Rice,

26:44.480 --> 26:46.620
we just have a couple of things
we need to go over.

26:46.820 --> 26:47.690
Do we have to do it now?

26:47.890 --> 26:49.350
We kind of do.
Oh, no.

26:49.550 --> 26:50.690
Now, the place is a mess.

26:50.890 --> 26:52.610
Mm, we promise
not to hold it against you.

26:58.480 --> 26:59.760
Byron, I was

26:59.960 --> 27:02.550
think...
Ms. Powell.

27:04.490 --> 27:07.300
Uh, I was just
giving Byron a hand.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.270
Uh, would you mind

27:09.470 --> 27:10.710
stepping into
the other room?

27:10.910 --> 27:12.180
Why?

27:12.380 --> 27:13.710
Uh, lets us keep straight
who says what

27:13.910 --> 27:15.650
when we're filling out
our reports.

27:15.850 --> 27:17.350
Standard
detective stuff.

27:17.550 --> 27:20.070
Oh...

27:26.210 --> 27:28.530
KILLIAN:
<i>So, you decided to move</i>
<i>after Marcus</i>

27:28.730 --> 27:30.190
<i>was killed, I guess.</i>
BYRON: <i>Yeah.</i>

27:30.390 --> 27:31.830
I didn't want
to be here anymore.

27:32.030 --> 27:34.150
That's understandable.

27:39.820 --> 27:41.140
(footsteps)

27:41.340 --> 27:44.510
When was it that you
and Byron fell in love?

27:44.710 --> 27:45.980
What are you talking about?

27:46.180 --> 27:48.350
I see two side-by-side pillows,
both of which

27:48.550 --> 27:50.350
have been slept on,
I smell your perfume

27:50.550 --> 27:53.180
on one of them,
and it gets me to thinking

27:53.380 --> 27:56.170
the two of you are more
than just neighbors.

27:59.710 --> 28:00.860
It's none of your business.

28:01.060 --> 28:03.060
MORALES:
<i>I'm not judging you for it.</i>

28:03.260 --> 28:04.730
The heart wants what it wants.

28:04.930 --> 28:07.380
You don't know the first thing
about my heart.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.800
So, what was the $50,000

28:13.000 --> 28:15.870
you got from Adam Lustig for,
Mr. Rice?

28:16.070 --> 28:18.740
I told you, after Marcus passed,

28:18.940 --> 28:20.010
I decided to sell.

28:20.210 --> 28:21.280
MORALES:
How much did you stand to make

28:21.480 --> 28:22.580
from the sale of the house?

28:22.780 --> 28:24.680
The longer Marcus held out,

28:24.880 --> 28:27.180
the more
they increased the offer.

28:27.380 --> 28:29.820
Well, your house is worth
a lot more than $50,000.

28:30.020 --> 28:31.160
You're right,

28:31.360 --> 28:33.320
but I signed
a nondisclosure agreement.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.930
So, either you can tell me
or I can get a subpoena

28:36.130 --> 28:38.150
and go through
your bank accounts.

28:39.380 --> 28:41.700
$50,000 was ten percent down.

28:41.900 --> 28:43.000
By the time Marcus died,

28:43.200 --> 28:45.270
the offer was up to
half a million.

28:45.470 --> 28:48.010
Okay, so what he was offering
was $500,000?

28:48.210 --> 28:49.670
Mr. Lustig does not want that
getting out.

28:49.870 --> 28:51.940
Now, getting half a million
dollars is something

28:52.140 --> 28:53.580
of a life-changing event,
I'd think.

28:53.780 --> 28:56.180
MORALES:
<i>That must've been tempting.</i>

28:56.380 --> 28:57.610
Marcus wasn't tempted by money.

28:57.820 --> 28:59.100
What about you?

29:00.970 --> 29:03.220
(grunts)

29:03.420 --> 29:04.590
Whoa.

29:04.790 --> 29:07.090
You already got a place
in North Carolina?

29:07.290 --> 29:08.590
See what it's like down there.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.800
Uh, see, 9122

29:11.000 --> 29:12.430
Oberlin Drive.
That wouldn't

29:12.630 --> 29:14.770
belong to Lustig's company,
by any chance, would it?

29:14.970 --> 29:16.130
It's a condo.

29:16.330 --> 29:17.270
I'm just
subletting it.

29:17.470 --> 29:18.900
I don't know who
it belongs to.

29:19.100 --> 29:20.570
I just...

29:20.770 --> 29:22.640
figured maybe Lustig
wanted to sweeten

29:22.840 --> 29:23.910
the deal by
throwing in

29:24.110 --> 29:25.610
a rent-free place to live.

29:25.810 --> 29:28.730
MORALES:
Did your husband know
you were having an affair?

29:30.230 --> 29:31.580
Yeah, he knew.

29:31.780 --> 29:33.420
Is it possible your husband
refused to take that

29:33.620 --> 29:35.790
half a million dollars
because he knew

29:35.990 --> 29:38.520
his friend next door, who his
wife was cheating on him with,

29:38.720 --> 29:40.660
also stood to make
a half a million dollars?

29:40.860 --> 29:43.930
He didn't turn down
their offer for spite.

29:44.130 --> 29:46.030
He turned it down

29:46.230 --> 29:49.130
because taking their offer
meant abandoning

29:49.330 --> 29:51.400
his principles.

29:51.600 --> 29:52.770
(sighs)

29:52.970 --> 29:55.340
KILLIAN:
So where were you
two nights ago, Byron?

29:55.540 --> 29:56.540
(scoffs)

29:56.740 --> 29:58.040
I met Byron
for dinner that night.

29:58.240 --> 29:59.540
I stopped off for dinner
with Marcus and Bettina

29:59.740 --> 30:00.710
on my way home from work.

30:00.910 --> 30:01.750
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?

30:01.950 --> 30:03.710
We went to Junior's.

30:03.920 --> 30:05.480
Gage & Tollner.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.620
Here's what I think
you might've done,

30:07.820 --> 30:10.250
you told your husband
that you heard someone

30:10.450 --> 30:11.660
prowling around outside,

30:11.860 --> 30:14.690
maybe one of the drug addicts
Lustig enlisted.

30:14.890 --> 30:16.130
Your husband goes outside

30:16.330 --> 30:17.590
where Byron is waiting for him,

30:17.790 --> 30:19.630
hits him over the head
with a shovel,

30:19.830 --> 30:21.580
and kills him.

30:23.380 --> 30:24.840
The plan was Bettina's idea.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.770
The plan was Byron's idea.

30:26.970 --> 30:28.070
MORALES:
But you knew,

30:28.270 --> 30:29.470
when you sent
your husband outside,

30:29.670 --> 30:33.180
that Byron was waiting out there
to kill him,

30:33.380 --> 30:35.730
and that's why you sent him.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.670
Yeah.

30:40.770 --> 30:42.690
I went along with it.

30:42.890 --> 30:44.220
I didn't mean to kill him.

30:44.420 --> 30:47.490
Well, that definitely counts
for something, Byron.

30:47.690 --> 30:49.130
When you write your statement,

30:49.330 --> 30:51.360
put down what
you did mean to do.

30:51.560 --> 30:52.760
Well,

30:52.960 --> 30:55.430
the good news is they solved
a homicide today.

30:55.630 --> 30:57.730
And the bad news is that Lustig

30:57.940 --> 31:00.420
had nothing to do with it.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.330
* *

31:15.200 --> 31:16.920
Wow.

31:17.120 --> 31:18.490
So, you managed to

31:18.690 --> 31:21.890
talk your way past the station
house security downstairs

31:22.090 --> 31:23.630
and my assistant just outside.
(scoffs)

31:23.830 --> 31:25.400
What-what is it
you want to tell me

31:25.600 --> 31:26.900
that was worth
doing all that for?

31:27.100 --> 31:29.430
I wanted to let you know
that Raymond fired me.

31:29.630 --> 31:31.770
What, am I supposed to feel
guilty about that?

31:31.970 --> 31:34.610
You've made too many difficult
decisions in your career

31:34.810 --> 31:36.610
to let guilt be a factor.
So why are you here?

31:36.810 --> 31:38.440
Because Raymond Sharpe
could be the next mayor,

31:38.640 --> 31:40.440
and you could be
his police commissioner.

31:40.640 --> 31:42.450
You're both well-suited
for the job,

31:42.650 --> 31:45.380
and I don't want
one dumbass move on my part

31:45.580 --> 31:47.020
to derail the whole thing.

31:47.220 --> 31:48.520
So why did you do it?

31:48.720 --> 31:49.850
What did you think
you were gonna get out of it?

31:50.050 --> 31:52.260
I wanted people
to see you in command

31:52.460 --> 31:54.030
and feel reassured,

31:54.230 --> 31:55.260
feel like you would

31:55.460 --> 31:56.430
keep them safe.

31:56.630 --> 31:58.100
You-you have

31:58.300 --> 31:59.300
the authority. God knows

31:59.500 --> 32:00.400
you have the looks.
(sighs)

32:00.600 --> 32:02.230
I wanted to make you a hero.

32:02.430 --> 32:04.170
Whoa. I-I probably, uh...

32:04.370 --> 32:06.300
No, I-I made a mistake

32:06.500 --> 32:08.940
getting involved in
a political campaign.
No.

32:09.140 --> 32:11.810
John, I am sorry.

32:12.010 --> 32:15.810
I'm sorry I embarrassed
you and your officers.

32:16.010 --> 32:19.620
I tend to justify my behavior by
whether or not it helps me win.

32:19.820 --> 32:22.150
It makes me a very good

32:22.350 --> 32:24.590
political consultant,

32:24.790 --> 32:27.710
but not a very good
person sometimes.

32:28.910 --> 32:30.290
Well, for what it's worth,

32:30.490 --> 32:32.460
I'm sorry that, uh,
you got fired.

32:32.660 --> 32:35.270
Well, it's not
without its upsides.

32:35.470 --> 32:38.920
Which is what?

32:49.960 --> 32:52.480
If we were still
working together,

32:52.680 --> 32:54.450
that would be
completely

32:54.650 --> 32:55.720
unprofessional.

32:55.920 --> 32:58.470
It still might not be
a good idea.

33:00.010 --> 33:03.010
When we were
at dinner that night...

33:04.210 --> 33:06.150
...you wanted to kiss me,
didn't you?

33:08.050 --> 33:09.170
Yes, I did.

33:09.370 --> 33:10.430
And why didn't you?

33:10.630 --> 33:12.970
Because, uh,
our association

33:13.170 --> 33:15.490
was supposed to be,
uh, work-related.

33:18.990 --> 33:21.100
Now it's not.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.630
And now you can.

33:39.180 --> 33:40.800
(meows)
(scoffs)

33:41.000 --> 33:43.170
How late you working tonight?
Probably till midnight.

33:43.370 --> 33:45.140
I don't know how long
you can keep on doing this.

33:45.340 --> 33:47.200
I was actually thinking
you might want to pick up

33:47.400 --> 33:48.540
a quick 500
yourself some night.

33:48.740 --> 33:51.010
Mm, no thanks.
Ah.

33:51.210 --> 33:54.250
Anyways, tonight's a private
party, should be pretty quiet.

33:54.450 --> 33:56.050
Come on. Oh...

33:56.250 --> 33:57.710
Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna straighten him out.

33:57.910 --> 33:59.080
You're not gonna straighten
him out. You're not gonna

33:59.280 --> 34:00.950
straighten anyone out.
NELSON: I'm gonna go back

34:01.150 --> 34:02.220
in there, and I'm gonna
straighten him out.
Yeah, uh, hey.

34:02.420 --> 34:03.950
Sir, I have a situation here,

34:04.160 --> 34:05.720
if you could just stay put
for a second, you'd be

34:05.920 --> 34:07.760
really helping me out. Whoa,
whoa, where you going with that?

34:07.960 --> 34:09.690
I told you, I'm gonna
straighten this guy out.

34:09.890 --> 34:11.630
No, you go in there with that,
it's a felony.

34:11.830 --> 34:12.630
I don't care.

34:12.830 --> 34:13.900
And you're gonna have to

34:14.100 --> 34:15.180
beat me unconscious
with it first.

34:16.850 --> 34:19.950
I'm not going down
without a fight, bro.

34:23.660 --> 34:25.090
(sighs)

34:26.890 --> 34:28.900
Thanks, man.
I appreciate it.

34:29.930 --> 34:31.780
Oh, thank you for waiting, sir.

34:31.980 --> 34:32.880
You can come on in.
What do they

34:33.080 --> 34:34.620
pay you to do
what you do here?

34:34.820 --> 34:35.950
That's highly classified
information.

34:36.150 --> 34:38.060
Well, figure out
whatever lie it is

34:38.260 --> 34:40.670
you want to tell me,
and I'll triple it.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.130
To do what?

34:43.330 --> 34:46.000
Threat assessment,
personal protection,

34:46.200 --> 34:47.800
pretty much what it is
you do here,

34:48.000 --> 34:49.370
only it would be
just for me.

34:49.570 --> 34:50.930
Yeah, who are you?

34:51.130 --> 34:52.640
Bobby Azeroff.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.020
(dance music playing inside)

35:04.170 --> 35:05.180
Hi, honey.

35:05.380 --> 35:07.050
Hey.

35:07.250 --> 35:08.690
How long have you been
waiting out here?

35:08.890 --> 35:10.850
Oh, about an hour or so.
How was work?

35:11.050 --> 35:14.070
It was, um... it was good.

35:16.310 --> 35:17.880
Come on in.
Nice.

35:23.380 --> 35:24.940
You have
dinner plans?

35:25.140 --> 35:28.570
Uh, no. I was just gonna pull
something out of the freezer.

35:28.770 --> 35:30.210
How about you?

35:30.410 --> 35:32.840
I have a 9:00 meeting
at a Baptist church

35:33.040 --> 35:35.950
on Sutter Avenue, which I have
no idea where that is, but

35:36.150 --> 35:39.220
other than that, no plans.

35:39.420 --> 35:40.980
So, you, um...

35:41.180 --> 35:43.190
you still going
to AA meetings?

35:43.390 --> 35:44.660
(soft chuckle)

35:44.860 --> 35:48.380
If I wasn't, I don't think
I'd be here talking to you.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.460
No, you see, Ma, but...

35:51.660 --> 35:52.530
you would be.

35:52.730 --> 35:55.300
And that's
what worries me.

35:55.500 --> 35:57.100
That you would be here
saying the same stuff

35:57.300 --> 35:59.890
in the same sort of way,
and it would just all be a lie.

36:02.620 --> 36:05.140
I have a year
and nine days, Brandy.

36:05.340 --> 36:08.930
I mean, my home meeting, they
gave me a cake and everything.

36:10.300 --> 36:11.870
Yeah.

36:12.870 --> 36:15.590
* I was wine drunk... *

36:15.790 --> 36:17.290
So, were you figuring
on staying here?

36:17.490 --> 36:19.520
I don't have to. I have, uh...

36:19.720 --> 36:22.330
a friend Cookie who's
got a place on Staten Island

36:22.530 --> 36:23.960
where she said
I could stay.

36:24.160 --> 36:25.830
* It was beautiful... *

36:26.030 --> 36:27.400
You don't have to go
to Staten Island.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.820
You can just
stay here.

36:34.390 --> 36:35.540
(sighs)

36:35.740 --> 36:39.340
* Devoid of our emptiness... *

36:39.540 --> 36:41.030
I'm sorry, baby.

36:43.530 --> 36:45.270
For what?

36:49.600 --> 36:51.910
For everything.

36:55.340 --> 36:56.730
(crying)

36:56.930 --> 36:59.130
I love you.

36:59.330 --> 37:01.180
Love you, too, Ma.

37:03.650 --> 37:06.140
Okay, thanks.

37:06.340 --> 37:07.600
Yeah?

37:07.800 --> 37:10.470
I heard arrests have been made
in the Marcus Powell

37:10.670 --> 37:11.740
investigation,
and I just

37:11.940 --> 37:13.840
wanted to come by
and say congratulations.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.350
You must be breathing
a sigh of relief.

37:16.550 --> 37:18.680
Notwithstanding your best
efforts to make me culpable,

37:18.880 --> 37:20.970
once again, I'm not culpable.

37:22.340 --> 37:23.490
By the way,

37:23.690 --> 37:26.120
you may not be aware
that I have doubled

37:26.320 --> 37:27.590
the number of low-income
housing units

37:27.790 --> 37:30.460
I'm providing at
Arcachon Towers East,

37:30.660 --> 37:32.460
my mixed-use development
in Bushwick.

37:32.660 --> 37:34.030
The one with the poor door?

37:34.230 --> 37:36.530
Oh... I find that term
offensive.

37:36.730 --> 37:38.170
It used to say "For Coloreds."

37:38.370 --> 37:39.640
So now we're gonna
make this racial?

37:39.840 --> 37:41.170
Is that what I'm doing?

37:41.370 --> 37:43.640
From everything I hear,
those folks are grateful.

37:43.840 --> 37:45.210
I mean, through no fault
of their own,

37:45.410 --> 37:47.010
they have to go through
a separate entrance,

37:47.210 --> 37:48.450
in return for which,
they get to live

37:48.650 --> 37:50.080
in a building they
couldn't afford otherwise.

37:50.280 --> 37:52.430
I mean, why... why
wouldn't they be grateful?

37:54.130 --> 37:57.150
That you would even think that,

37:57.350 --> 37:59.120
leaves no question in my mind

37:59.320 --> 38:01.360
whether you're capable
of murder.

38:01.560 --> 38:04.900
One day, I'm going to be able to
prove you're also guilty of it.

38:05.100 --> 38:07.880
Well, as long as that day
isn't today.

38:09.350 --> 38:10.370
I bid you good night

38:10.570 --> 38:12.300
and, seriously,

38:12.500 --> 38:14.540
congratulations.

38:14.740 --> 38:16.920
(footsteps retreating)

38:31.670 --> 38:33.970
Where are you right now?

38:37.610 --> 38:39.850
* *

38:44.320 --> 38:45.950
So...

38:49.360 --> 38:52.230
It's freezing.
Can we talk in the car?

38:54.760 --> 38:56.400
Sure.

38:59.030 --> 39:01.030
Get some heat going.

39:02.370 --> 39:05.360
Regina, you got me
on the edge of my seat.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.260
What is it
you're about to tell me?

39:07.460 --> 39:09.240
Sean Dryden.

39:11.040 --> 39:12.300
I've been doing
some thinking...

39:12.500 --> 39:13.900
Uh-oh.
I know.

39:14.100 --> 39:16.670
That's not always
a good thing.
I mean,

39:16.870 --> 39:18.800
depends on the conclusion
you reach.
My conclusion

39:19.000 --> 39:22.310
is the sight of you
makes me happy.

39:22.510 --> 39:24.390
But nervous.

39:25.660 --> 39:27.580
Uh-huh.
Let me guess,

39:27.780 --> 39:29.180
you think it might be a mistake

39:29.380 --> 39:31.000
that we're getting more
involved than we already are.

39:33.330 --> 39:34.920
You've got all kinds of insight

39:35.120 --> 39:36.220
into what I'm thinking,
don't you?

39:36.420 --> 39:38.960
I have no idea
what you're thinking.

39:39.160 --> 39:40.320
I'm thinking

39:40.520 --> 39:41.730
maybe we give

39:41.930 --> 39:44.280
thinking a rest.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.550
