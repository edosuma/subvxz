Get your team out of there. We'll clean up.

00:04.997 --> 00:06.903
We took down Idrisi, mission's over, right?

00:08.115 --> 00:09.115
Omair

00:09.151 --> 00:11.776
believed in something
that was true and pure.

00:12.955 --> 00:17.155
But you, you crave the
power, the excitement.

00:18.858 --> 00:21.720
I was monitoring comms within a
ten-mile radius of the facility.

00:21.968 --> 00:23.236
- And...
- What?

00:23.291 --> 00:25.598

01:15.286 --> 01:18.204
I shot Idrisi, twice.

01:18.314 --> 01:20.348
One in the chest, one in the head.

01:20.403 --> 01:21.983
There's no way he's
getting back up from that.

01:22.046 --> 01:23.579
That's not what the intel's saying, is it?

01:23.615 --> 01:25.681
'Intel!?' We're talking about
the incomplete recording of a

01:25.751 --> 01:27.051
goddamn phone call.

01:27.129 --> 01:28.750
And we don't know if that's true.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.964
The military confirmed it,
it's been headline news.

01:31.019 --> 01:32.123
I hope he is alive.

01:32.166 --> 01:34.566
I could happily hunt him down
every day for the rest of my life.

01:35.255 --> 01:36.538
Just got a hit on Lowry.

01:36.608 --> 01:39.040
She's moving in on the
home of Johannes Krieger.

01:39.103 --> 01:42.574
He's the CEO of Octagon.
A private military company.

01:42.610 --> 01:43.798
I came across him in Iraq.

01:43.861 --> 01:45.930
He's involved in some
real shady shit, that guy.

01:45.993 --> 01:47.623
Rendition flights. Black Sites.

01:47.701 --> 01:50.082
So now we're saying Idrisi's
in a prison somewhere?

01:50.153 --> 01:52.671
Did everybody lose their collective
minds when I wasn't looking?

01:52.741 --> 01:55.126
I'd like to know where are we
getting this intel on Lowry from?

01:55.172 --> 01:58.088
That's on a need-to-know basis and
several levels above your clearance.

01:58.142 --> 02:00.288
Right now, you need to focus on
the task at hand, she's already

02:00.327 --> 02:01.529
one step ahead of us.

02:01.584 --> 02:03.073

I received a phone call
saying that he was alive.

04:34.403 --> 04:35.659
Held on a black site.

04:35.722 --> 04:37.854
They didn't know where it
was, but they knew who ran it.

04:37.890 --> 04:40.614
Octagon. Your company.

04:40.650 --> 04:44.050
Now, I just need to know
the truth. And then I'm gone.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.945

She left us little people behind.

- Dead.

Statistically, Mac, the possibility
of life existing somewhere

07:00.551 --> 07:02.351
else in the universe is pretty damn good.

But you don't believe a man
can survive a bomb or a bullet

07:05.747 --> 07:07.067
because it hurts your pride.

07:09.328 --> 07:12.483
No, because if he's alive, it
means that somebody is fucking

07:12.547 --> 07:14.129
lying to us.

07:14.259 --> 07:17.223
Now, it could be my people, could
be your people, could be everybody.

How can you tell?

Come on, man, it's Kandinsky,
it's Russian. The guy basically

07:37.459 --> 07:39.365
created abstractionism.

who could usher in the reality of

who comes back from the dead,

08:40.389 --> 08:43.054

- We need to speak to Colonel Parker.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.446
It was his men who found the body.

08:44.509 --> 08:46.889
I'd rather not accuse a high-ranking
American officer of lying

08:46.952 --> 08:48.734
without solid evidence.

08:48.770 --> 08:52.139
I thought Lowry was finished.
Turns out she's only just begun.

08:53.343 --> 08:56.261
Rachel Sheridan. Ex-CIA
infrastructure specialist.

08:56.297 --> 08:58.899
Helped design Guantanamo before
going into the private sector.

08:58.935 --> 09:00.369
Stays off the grid as much as she can.

09:00.405 --> 09:02.600
So she gets paid to design
black sites for Octagon.

09:02.662 --> 09:07.294
Technically, she just modifies
existing sites. Foolproofs them.

09:08.065 --> 09:09.376
You know what I meant.

09:09.415 --> 09:10.500
Where do we find her?

09:10.555 --> 09:11.291
We don't.

09:11.327 --> 09:13.285
People like Sheridan disappear
so that people like us can't

09:13.321 --> 09:15.546
track 'em down. Nice work, Johnson.

09:17.260 --> 09:18.390
I'm onto it, Sarge.

09:18.452 --> 09:21.816
You withheld the information
about Volkan from us.

09:21.902 --> 09:24.570
MI-6 only shared his intel on
Jane's movements on the proviso that

09:24.648 --> 09:26.002
I kept it confidential.

09:26.062 --> 09:28.535
Yet, we're the ones
risking our lives out there.

09:28.615 --> 09:30.735
There are things you don't
need to know, Captain.

09:33.899 --> 09:35.153
We're all rattled by this.

09:35.225 --> 09:38.985
If Idrisi is alive, then that
means Colonel Parker lied to us.

09:39.664 --> 09:41.064
You know, maybe even his own people.

09:41.100 --> 09:44.075
This is a potentially explosive situation.

09:45.480 --> 09:50.336
What you did just there, that was
interesting. Anger then empathy.

09:50.372 --> 09:51.055
I'm sorry?

09:51.091 --> 09:52.664
Well, that's what you taught
me to do when dealing with a

09:52.700 --> 09:54.732
hostile witness, isn't it?
And it's what you're doing now.

09:54.779 --> 09:57.984
You even just switched from
"you" to "we" to get me on-side.

09:58.020 --> 10:01.097
Or maybe I'm just having a fucking
conversation with you, Captain.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.382
Save the mind games for Volkan Horacin.

10:04.740 --> 10:10.071
If you're with MI-6, why are you
invading mansions? Risking men?

10:11.210 --> 10:12.730
Losing men.

10:14.240 --> 10:17.634
She turned up, insisting Idrisi is alive.

10:17.681 --> 10:20.699
A fucking fairy tale and my
men, they start to believe it.

10:20.762 --> 10:22.109
I had no choice.

10:22.179 --> 10:24.089
So, you tip off MI-6.

10:24.133 --> 10:28.039
Make a little money, maybe
wipeout Lowry in the mean time.

10:29.189 --> 10:30.199
Win-win.

10:30.269 --> 10:34.445
We'll pay twice what MI-6 was
promising. Go back to your people.

10:34.523 --> 10:35.442
Lead us to Lowry.

10:35.478 --> 10:37.933
What, you think she's just
waiting for you to find her?

10:37.985 --> 10:41.737
No. But she'll find you.
And you give her to us.

10:54.238 --> 10:56.100
I liked the one with the whales the best.

10:56.155 --> 10:59.096
And 'The Wrath of Khan',
the one where you die.

10:59.166 --> 11:02.123
'Live long and prosper', it's beautiful.

11:02.201 --> 11:04.337
He's making a joke about your name,

11:04.407 --> 11:08.618
Volkan, Vulcan, y'know, like Spock.

11:09.475 --> 11:12.520
- Spock.
- No? More of a 'Star Wars' man?

11:13.244 --> 11:17.959
I know who you are. You are
the ones who killed Omair.

11:18.029 --> 11:20.549
And you sit there and
you joke and you laugh.

11:20.619 --> 11:22.669
- Alright, easy.
- I should fucking kill you both!

11:22.705 --> 11:24.317
Shit people! Scum fucks!

11:24.364 --> 11:28.196
Hey, hey! Calm down, alright?
I get it, you're angry.

11:28.282 --> 11:30.756
But you've made your choice.
You'll get your silver.

11:31.818 --> 11:33.081

11:33.156 --> 11:35.874
Yeah, I know my task, Sergeant.

11:39.705 --> 11:41.333
Ma'am... we're not going to find Sheridan.

11:41.403 --> 11:43.474
I did find Lila Hall though.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.189
- Who's that?
- That's Sheridan's daughter.

11:45.225 --> 11:47.909
Sheridan kept her maiden name,
Hall was the father's surname.

11:47.945 --> 11:49.584
American, deceased.

11:49.639 --> 11:52.629
She moved to Europe a few years
ago, studying at university in

Hamburg, works in a bar part-time.

11:55.851 --> 11:58.342

too. That puts the daughter at risk.

11:58.378 --> 11:59.637
Let's find her before they do.

11:59.673 --> 12:00.512
Yes, ma'am.

12:00.548 --> 12:01.657
What bar's she at?

12:08.385 --> 12:10.671
Volkan, we thought you were dead.

12:10.734 --> 12:12.494
I appreciate the concern.

Something you want to tell me, Kadir?

12:26.408 --> 12:30.319

we had to take precautions.

12:33.275 --> 12:36.382
You are my people.

to rendezvous with Novin.

13:40.119 --> 13:41.839
How did you get out of there?

13:42.350 --> 13:45.336
I'm more concerned about how
British military knew we were there

13:45.394 --> 13:46.634
in the first place.

13:46.695 --> 13:47.928
Answer the question.

13:47.964 --> 13:52.096
- Stop.
- I'll talk. But only to you.

13:57.839 --> 14:01.644
They let me go, because
they want me to betray you.

14:01.936 --> 14:02.767
Yeah.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.108
Something must've made them
think you'd take the deal.

14:09.636 --> 14:11.027
I was convincing.

14:11.212 --> 14:12.166
(SARCASTICALLY) Ow.

14:13.673 --> 14:17.557
Oh, no. You were honest.
You will betray me.

14:18.869 --> 14:20.499
I understand that.

14:31.327 --> 14:39.251
You've lost your faith.
Omair Idrisi is alive.

14:46.134 --> 14:49.326
We find Rachel Sheridan,

14:49.386 --> 14:51.176
we find my husband.

14:53.555 --> 14:55.795
And I'll teach you to believe again.

15:02.672 --> 15:05.484
Finally. Some culture.

15:06.070 --> 15:08.084
OK. This is a serious misrepresentation of

American frontier life.

15:09.779 --> 15:12.757
- Any sign of Lila?
- Yeah. By the bar. I got this.

15:12.793 --> 15:13.607
Like you had Idrisi?

15:13.643 --> 15:15.746
Oh, listen to you. The
guy who can't let go.

15:17.141 --> 15:18.008
Hey!

15:19.791 --> 15:21.188
Hey. Any chance of a beer?

15:21.224 --> 15:22.485
I'm on a break.

15:23.898 --> 15:28.132
Is that Schopenhauer.
That's... That's good stuff.

15:28.725 --> 15:30.742
Seriously? He's an asshole.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.365
That's a little strong.

15:32.401 --> 15:34.559
I consider the guy
somewhat of a personal hero.

15:34.637 --> 15:37.989
He said women were mostly suited
for babysitting because they're

15:38.025 --> 15:40.546
childish, foolish, and short-sighted.

15:40.609 --> 15:42.851
OK. You will grant it he had some issues.

15:42.890 --> 15:45.909
That nature strips them of beauty
after they give birth because

15:45.945 --> 15:48.262
it's not necessary for
them to breed anymore.

15:48.324 --> 15:51.300
Yeah. OK, well, that...
that one is-is-is terrible.

15:51.362 --> 15:55.024
It's my belief that the majority
of metaphysical philosophy was

15:55.063 --> 15:59.831
written by unattractive men who
were terrified of the opposite sex.

16:01.034 --> 16:03.593
I would like to buy you a
very big drink, right now.

16:03.651 --> 16:05.411
I don't drink at work.

16:09.555 --> 16:12.421
Well, then, maybe we could
talk about your mother, Lila.

16:14.959 --> 16:16.706
I think you've made a mistake.

16:16.742 --> 16:18.871
My name's Wyatt. Sergeant Samuel Wyatt.

16:18.938 --> 16:21.320
Right now, there's some very
dangerous people looking for her.

16:21.406 --> 16:22.229
I'm here to help.

16:22.265 --> 16:24.549
You can walk out or
Security can throw you out.

16:24.585 --> 16:25.949
Three amigos walking in.

16:26.625 --> 16:27.785
Shall we?

16:27.854 --> 16:29.242
Hola, hola.

16:36.025 --> 16:37.167
Please, give me a minute.

16:37.203 --> 16:38.723
Fuck your minute.

16:42.328 --> 16:43.648
- Look, I'm sorry about this.

Get what you need, make it quick.

17:58.235 --> 18:01.167
What's this about? Why is my
mother suddenly so important?

18:01.542 --> 18:03.589
Your mother knows where Omair Idrisi is.

18:03.689 --> 18:06.497
Yeah, you might want to check
the news, soldier. Idrisi is dead.

18:06.533 --> 18:08.137
Yeah, I know. I was there.

18:08.195 --> 18:09.268
In fact, I was the guy that shot him.

18:09.311 --> 18:11.351
Twice. And then a mountain
came down on top of him.

18:11.409 --> 18:13.173
Still, here we are.

18:13.472 --> 18:14.168
Okay.

18:14.204 --> 18:16.302
That's highly confidential
information, by the way.

18:16.708 --> 18:18.269
But you understand why
your mother is in danger?

18:18.305 --> 18:21.029
Fuck her! This is why I keep my distance.

18:21.065 --> 18:22.752
Her life ruins mine.

18:22.807 --> 18:25.055
Yeah, I get that. Bet it gets tough.

18:25.091 --> 18:30.545
It's tough? My father worked
for an American NGO in Syria.

18:30.644 --> 18:34.549
When I was thirteen, she turned
him into a CIA mole to collect

18:34.585 --> 18:38.183
information from some
colleagues, political activists.

18:38.277 --> 18:43.031
First, Dad resisted, but
Mum always gets her own way.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.607
One afternoon, those colleagues
drive him to the middle of nowhere

18:45.643 --> 18:47.378
and put a bullet in his head.

18:54.465 --> 18:58.465
Hey. Sorry about your father.

19:00.145 --> 19:02.149
If it's any consolation,
my mother signed me up for a

19:02.185 --> 19:04.989
post-apocalyptic death cult
before my tenth birthday.

19:05.735 --> 19:10.697
(SCOFFS) That actually sounds kinda cool.

19:10.759 --> 19:12.629
I was kinda made to believe
that the world was ending on a

19:12.665 --> 19:14.254
bi-monthly basis.

19:14.316 --> 19:17.039
After the fourth or fifth time,
that shit gets a little stale.

19:17.110 --> 19:21.538
But those first few times, right?
They must have been pretty exciting.

19:21.585 --> 19:26.273
Yeah. You never feel more alive
than when you're facing death.

19:37.615 --> 19:40.347
Yeah. You're a soldier, alright.

19:55.191 --> 19:57.837
My fucking heart's beating
a hundred miles an hour.

19:57.931 --> 19:59.197
Yeah, me too.

20:02.385 --> 20:03.739
It's kinda scary, right?

20:08.895 --> 20:10.495
One way of looking at it.

20:20.191 --> 20:21.191
We got time.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.656
Lila, I don't think...

Okay, we've got time.

Yeah. Definitely a Schopenhauer fan.

Did you seriously think I was
just going to fuck you, twenty

21:17.785 --> 21:19.695
minutes after first meeting you?

21:19.768 --> 21:21.328
It does happen.

21:21.575 --> 21:24.542
Lila, look, please, you're in danger.

21:24.581 --> 21:26.212
Yeah. Guys with guns. I gathered that.

21:26.275 --> 21:28.309
Wait, no! Lila, I'm just
trying to protect you.

21:28.345 --> 21:29.752
Why do they want me, Wyatt?

21:29.814 --> 21:31.268
They're using you to get to your mother.

21:31.304 --> 21:32.662
And why do you want me?

21:34.112 --> 21:35.307
It's not...

21:35.823 --> 21:36.719
It's not the same.

21:36.755 --> 21:39.264
You all carry guns and
you all think you're right.

21:40.385 --> 21:44.089
Lila. Lila, plea... Lila!

21:44.439 --> 21:45.862
G'day, love!

21:46.495 --> 21:48.011
Oh, there he is.

21:50.105 --> 21:51.225
Attaboy.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.511
You're coming with me, little bunny.

21:55.534 --> 21:56.417
Now then.

21:56.457 --> 21:57.221
Hey.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.118
Do you know where your mother is, Lila?

22:03.154 --> 22:05.269
Have you ever met my mother, Colonel?

22:05.355 --> 22:08.465
She tells me two things. Jack and shit.

22:08.501 --> 22:11.194
Lila, you do know what's
at stake here, don't you?

22:11.230 --> 22:15.985
Yeah. Sure. Safety of the free
world. Omair Idrisi. Jane Lowry.

22:16.039 --> 22:19.196
The boogeyman. None of it is my concern.

22:19.243 --> 22:21.849

22:21.935 --> 22:23.232
You're part of this world.

22:23.268 --> 22:27.339
I'm not. And I never
wanted to be. So, fuck her.

22:27.375 --> 22:30.279
Fuck you. And let me go home.

22:34.890 --> 22:35.989
Lila.

22:36.025 --> 22:38.295
Shouldn't you be tied to a bed somewhere?

22:38.361 --> 22:40.073
Oh, come on. I let you do that.

22:40.112 --> 22:41.789
Trying to gain your trust.

22:42.084 --> 22:44.639
OK, alright, you got me.

22:45.933 --> 22:49.231
But Lila, listen, the people that
came for you, they're not done.

22:49.825 --> 22:50.462
They will come back.

22:50.508 --> 22:54.005
I know. So I've got to pack, got to move.

22:54.041 --> 22:56.887
Even without being here, my mother
has successfully screwed up my

22:56.949 --> 22:58.256
life again.

gonna wanna keep this.

Ma'am, it's Volkan.

23:47.300 --> 23:48.654
You have something for me?

23:48.718 --> 23:53.126
I stole files from her laptop,
it will lead you to Lowry.

23:53.175 --> 23:54.569
Or, near enough.

23:55.256 --> 23:56.631
We'll send someone.

23:56.694 --> 23:59.556
What? And wake up in some
prison somewhere, bag on my head?

23:59.592 --> 24:00.694
Fuck that.

24:01.157 --> 24:07.139
Dead drop. 35 Kopenicker Street,

- I could go. Uh, copy as well.

Well, the rest of the team are on mission.

24:16.920 --> 24:19.114
It's just a dead drop. Simple enough.

24:19.196 --> 24:22.297
I don't trust Volkan. Simple
might not be what's waiting.

24:23.472 --> 24:24.945
Yeah. Understood, ma'am.

25:00.516 --> 25:02.472
I told you never to come here.

25:02.522 --> 25:04.488
Really, not even a 'hello'?

25:11.179 --> 25:13.451
Okay. A hello.

25:36.092 --> 25:37.416
Is everything okay?

25:38.307 --> 25:40.829
It's just you've been a
bit quiet with me, is all.

25:41.419 --> 25:43.219
Don't make it weird, Will.

25:45.388 --> 25:46.707
You say that about everything.

25:46.743 --> 25:48.598
What do you think happens here?

25:48.684 --> 25:52.983
We fuck, we fall in love, there'll be
a white wedding with doves and shit?

25:53.019 --> 25:56.201

talk straight to me, for once.

- There's no room for anything else.
- I don't think that's true.

hang out and ask questions.

- Stay in the car. I've got this.

27:26.722 --> 27:28.563
I told them I didn't know where you were.

27:28.608 --> 27:30.889
It doesn't matter what you
told them. They could tail you.

27:30.944 --> 27:34.355
No, I made sure, one of the
soldiers, he gave me a note.

27:34.391 --> 27:36.948
- A note?
- Telling me not to come find you.

27:37.015 --> 27:38.335
Why the hell would he do that?

27:40.397 --> 27:42.187
- We had a connection.
- Oh, God!

27:42.223 --> 27:44.067
Do we have to have the talk
about the birds and the bees with

27:44.103 --> 27:47.147
their big army dicks and the stupid
wide-eyed girls who fall for them.

27:47.183 --> 27:48.587
I think he was trying to warn me.

27:48.623 --> 27:50.355
Then why the fuck didn't you listen?

27:51.167 --> 27:54.435
Because your work always screws
the rest of us and you never seem

27:54.471 --> 27:55.278
to get that.

realised, enough is enough.

mean do whatever the hell you like.

- What?
- Shh. Listen.

the sound of an apology.

- That is funny. Thank you.

31:11.721 --> 31:13.158
I don't know. I'm not...

31:13.260 --> 31:18.394
OK. There's this thing that they
teach you, body language, right?

31:18.466 --> 31:23.318
The tells people have.
You could be lying to me.

31:24.380 --> 31:28.733
But you could be terrified,
telling me things from the heart.

31:30.691 --> 31:32.691
I gotta make a judgement call.

31:35.180 --> 31:40.024
Look, look, the only thing
that I know is that Lila,

31:40.134 --> 31:42.361
her daughter, said she doesn't
know where her mother is.

31:42.452 --> 31:46.365
That's it. That's all. Please.

31:55.787 --> 32:01.096
Volkan here, he lost his way.
But he's coming back to us.

32:01.185 --> 32:03.945
We all believe in
something. Even you, Will.

32:07.383 --> 32:08.764
So, listen to me.

32:09.491 --> 32:16.661
I'm asking you, one more
time. Please, just tell me.

32:18.028 --> 32:21.859
I don't know, I don't know
where Rachel Sheridan is.

32:22.532 --> 32:24.037
I promise, I don't.

32:27.361 --> 32:28.408
Okay.

32:28.659 --> 32:30.684
Please, please.

32:35.070 --> 32:37.299
I'm just the computer guy. I don't know.

32:45.604 --> 32:47.979
Stop. Stop, please.... (SCREAMS)

32:53.951 --> 32:55.630
- Ms. Sheridan.
- Don't 'Ms' me.

32:55.682 --> 32:59.134
I don't think you understand how
serious this might be, if Omair Idrisi...

32:59.191 --> 33:01.244
I get how serious you
think it might be, soldier.

33:01.286 --> 33:03.050
Was he the one?

33:03.290 --> 33:04.844
Yeah, he's the one.

33:04.925 --> 33:07.693
If Idrisi's alive, we need to
find out which black site he's in.

33:07.755 --> 33:09.066
When he was 'dead', who claimed the body?

33:09.128 --> 33:11.134
Colonel Parker, JSOC.

33:11.170 --> 33:13.402
Oh, now, that is interesting.
You see, I know Parker.

33:13.438 --> 33:15.030
Do you mind if my daughter leaves?

33:15.066 --> 33:17.349
It's just there's a keypad
in that box on the wall.

33:17.385 --> 33:19.829
If I don't punch in a code
every four hours, this place

33:19.865 --> 33:21.974
detonates, takes down everyone inside it.

33:22.052 --> 33:24.619
And we're already on three
hours fifty-eight. Tick-tock.

33:24.682 --> 33:26.934
- I think Lila can leave.
- Nobody's going anywhere.

33:27.286 --> 33:30.777
There's a site I redesigned. It's
run by private military; Octagon.

33:30.855 --> 33:31.662
Johannes Krieger.

33:31.717 --> 33:34.766
But it's paid for and controlled
by, anybody want to guess here?

33:34.808 --> 33:36.528
- Parker.
- Exactly.

33:36.611 --> 33:40.055
Parker finds Idrisi alive. Decides
he wants to pump him for intel.

33:40.130 --> 33:41.412
So he hides him in a black site.

33:41.467 --> 33:44.222
Somewhere where the bleeding
hearts in Congress can't stop him.

33:44.300 --> 33:46.599
Somewhere he can kill a man and
bring him back, over and over

33:46.654 --> 33:48.403
again, with impunity.

33:48.442 --> 33:49.938
That lyin' son of a bitch.

33:49.974 --> 33:52.442
We're through the looking
glass here, soldier. One minute.

33:52.496 --> 33:53.713
- So can she leave?
- Yes.

33:53.760 --> 33:56.734
No! Not until you tell us
where this black site is.

33:56.770 --> 33:58.774
Why? Maybe Parker's doing good.

33:58.810 --> 34:00.901
Maybe he's getting his hands
dirty but saving the world.

34:00.952 --> 34:03.302
We don't care about
Parker, we care about Lowry.

34:04.052 --> 34:06.204
- Lowry?
- And she's coming for him.

34:07.810 --> 34:11.786
Oh, that could be a problem.
Yeah. Forty-five seconds...

34:11.831 --> 34:14.364
Can you all stop pointing
fucking guns at each other?

34:14.435 --> 34:17.000
Nobody's actually going to shoot anybody.

34:17.071 --> 34:19.054
- What?
- This is all just a bluff.

34:19.090 --> 34:20.580
It's just a way to sound each other out.

34:20.641 --> 34:21.716
We're not gonna shoot your mother.

34:21.786 --> 34:25.415
Your mother, hopefully,
is not gonna shoot us.

34:25.980 --> 34:30.232
And I guarantee there is no
timer hidden in a box, with a

34:30.268 --> 34:32.908
- countdown of...
- (BOX BEEPS)

34:36.590 --> 34:38.150
...thirty-one seconds.

34:47.304 --> 34:49.809
You know, you might just
be the world's worst mother?

34:49.844 --> 34:51.561
You're still alive, aren't you?

34:52.458 --> 34:56.185
So, Lowry and Idrisi, yeah.

34:56.239 --> 35:00.694
Hey. So you probably guessed,
we tailed you out here.

35:00.855 --> 35:02.291
You used me.

35:02.343 --> 35:04.343
To be fair, I did tell
you not to come here.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.789
Look, this is... it's... it's the job.

35:06.839 --> 35:08.274
This is my family.

35:10.314 --> 35:11.959
You know, the best thing you
can do right now, is jump in your

35:12.029 --> 35:13.494
car, and get outta here.

35:13.583 --> 35:15.455
He's right. Go home, Lila.

35:16.025 --> 35:18.214
You all dragged me into this shit.

35:18.765 --> 35:20.426
I'll go when I choose.

35:21.130 --> 35:25.872
Klomino, Poland. It's an
abandoned Soviet military complex.

35:25.908 --> 35:27.614
That's Parker's black site.

35:27.650 --> 35:29.174
That's where you'll find Idrisi.

35:29.210 --> 35:31.209
Is there a way in for us?

35:31.269 --> 35:32.985
My job is high-risk.

35:33.056 --> 35:34.963
One day, I might find out something
I shouldn't and then they'll

35:35.053 --> 35:36.097
try and silence me.

35:36.133 --> 35:39.022
Car bomb. Sniper. Or what
would be the greatest irony.

35:39.069 --> 35:40.971
Lock you away in one
of your own black sites.

35:41.044 --> 35:43.849
Exactly. Which is why I build
a backdoor into every place.

35:43.907 --> 35:46.031
Now, here is a decayed arterial tunnel.

35:46.094 --> 35:48.318
You'll find an entrance on the
perimeter, hidden in the old

35:48.367 --> 35:51.720
drainage system, it's about
half a klick from the main site.

35:57.764 --> 36:00.174
You're all either very
brave or very stupid.

36:00.512 --> 36:04.186
Because you might manage to
find a way in, but there's no way

36:04.245 --> 36:05.845
you'll ever get out.

36:15.900 --> 36:17.854
Arriving at last known location.

36:17.890 --> 36:19.532
No hits yet on traffic cams.

36:21.810 --> 36:25.934
Keep checking every locale that we
know, keep going. Just stay focused.

36:25.970 --> 36:28.201
At the wrecking yard, on approach.

36:52.417 --> 36:53.377
Will!

37:02.283 --> 37:05.382
Will? Oh, my God!

37:09.409 --> 37:11.234
I need a medivac. Now!

37:11.270 --> 37:15.128
Sh... She asked me... She asked me.

37:16.790 --> 37:18.734
I told her about the farmhouse.

37:19.301 --> 37:21.838
Boss, do you copy? Operation compromised.

37:22.129 --> 37:23.699
I'm so sorry.

37:23.878 --> 37:26.358
Bravo, move out fast,
you've been compromised.

37:29.096 --> 37:30.536
I have movement.

37:32.892 --> 37:36.925
- (GUNSHOTS)
- Everybody get down. Get down!

37:38.357 --> 37:41.717
Down, down, down. Whatever
happens, you stay down.

37:47.951 --> 37:50.694
Sustained fire, they're trying
to drive us out the back.

37:51.656 --> 37:56.243
Be too exposed, no cover.
We need to stand our ground.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.214
It's me they want, isn't it?

38:00.500 --> 38:02.109
Stay there, we'll get you out.

38:05.159 --> 38:08.607
Lila! Lila... I'm sorry!

38:10.089 --> 38:13.496
Hey! There's a chest over there.
You'll find something useful in it.

38:13.532 --> 38:15.572
I'm gonna try and lead them away.

38:16.530 --> 38:18.658
No, wait! Hey!

38:20.179 --> 38:22.986
Rachel, wait! Shit!

38:23.022 --> 38:24.570
(RAPID GUNFIRE)

39:41.397 --> 39:42.514
Move.

39:45.488 --> 39:50.421
Wyatt, Sergeant Wyatt.

39:50.639 --> 39:51.800
Take the shot.

(RAPID GUNFIRE CONTINUES)

40:08.367 --> 40:09.727

40:23.022 --> 40:24.582

(GRUNTS, WHACK)

41:09.607 --> 41:11.487
- Where's Lowry?
- (WHACK)

41:14.136 --> 41:16.891
Where is she? Now... Now you listen to me.

41:16.936 --> 41:17.860
(WHACKS)

41:18.959 --> 41:20.355
Where's Lowry?

41:40.520 --> 41:42.304
Sheridan's in the wind, ma'am.

42:31.849 --> 42:32.849
(KNOCKS)

42:36.410 --> 42:37.370
What?

42:37.829 --> 42:39.736
I'm not saying that I'm a good person, OK?

42:39.772 --> 42:42.849
I-I've done... I've done things and erm...

42:42.884 --> 42:43.933
And?

42:47.399 --> 42:51.753
And when this is all over,
maybe, maybe there's a world where

42:51.789 --> 42:55.629
- you and I can have that drink.
- No.

42:56.276 --> 42:58.262
OK, I just, I thought I'd chat...

43:03.488 --> 43:04.958
Sergeant Wyatt.

43:07.030 --> 43:11.390
I'm fucking with you.
Yeah, there's a world.

43:14.200 --> 43:15.177
Alright.

43:20.383 --> 43:21.623
Wyatt, we need to go.
