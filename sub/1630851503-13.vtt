08:58.494 --> 09:00.061
Uh, it's a home loan
application.

09:00.104 --> 09:02.672
I found a house
that is perfect for me.

09:02.716 --> 09:04.152
Well, holy crap.

09:04.195 --> 09:05.588
I knew you were
looking for a place,

09:05.632 --> 09:07.808
but you're actually
buying a house?Trying.

09:07.851 --> 09:10.071
Turns out I can get a loan
with only 3% down

09:10.114 --> 09:12.639
because the area is
what they call "up-and-coming."

09:12.682 --> 09:14.423
Apparently,
the lead in the water

09:14.466 --> 09:16.817
is in the acceptable range.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.775
Alright, now,
do you know all the things

09:18.819 --> 09:21.169
to check for
before you make an offer?

09:21.212 --> 09:23.650
Radon, mold,
cracked foundation.

09:23.693 --> 09:25.173
I mean, those things
will cost you a fortune

09:25.216 --> 09:26.261
if you have to fix them.

09:26.304 --> 09:27.828
Oh, I don't know
about all that,

09:27.871 --> 09:29.786
but it has
one of them boxes

09:29.830 --> 09:32.267
that warshes your dishes
for ya.

09:32.310 --> 09:33.660
All I am saying is that

09:33.703 --> 09:35.618
when people get excited
about something,

09:35.662 --> 09:38.229
they tend to look at it
with rose-colored glasses

09:38.273 --> 09:40.275
and end up with something
that they don't want.

09:40.318 --> 09:42.059
You know,
like when I first saw you.

09:43.104 --> 09:44.975
No, that's not
what you're saying.

09:45.019 --> 09:47.630
You're saying you think
I don't know what I'm doing.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.676
Y-You're saying you think
I need a man.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.634
Don't.
Don't say it.

09:51.678 --> 09:54.071
Put the pin back in
that grenade, soldier.

09:54.115 --> 09:55.899
No one needs to die
needlessly here.

09:55.943 --> 09:58.336
All I was gonna say is
I am sorry,

09:58.380 --> 09:59.642
you do not need a man

09:59.686 --> 10:01.339
and I really hope
you get the house.

10:02.732 --> 10:05.082
Hang on a second.

10:05.126 --> 10:06.867
[ Sighs ]
I might need a man.

10:08.172 --> 10:10.000
I feel sorry for whoever
that poor bastard is.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.132
Have a great day.

10:11.175 --> 10:12.829
No, stop.

10:12.873 --> 10:15.702
The Realtor says that I have to
be part of a couple

10:15.745 --> 10:17.660
to have a real shot
with this seller.

10:17.704 --> 10:20.837
Apparently, any big,
dumb sack of male DNA

10:20.881 --> 10:22.883
will make me more attractive
as a buyer.

10:22.926 --> 10:25.668
If you're asking me to
pretend that we're a couple,

10:25.712 --> 10:27.539
then I need to be wooed.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.760
Tell me I'm pretty.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.894
[ Sighs ] Okay.

10:33.937 --> 10:37.288
You're a big,
dumb sack of pretty.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.550
Now will you go?

10:38.594 --> 10:40.727
Now that I feel good
about myself, yes.

10:41.553 --> 10:43.512
Alright, I got to take
a new selfie of us.

10:43.555 --> 10:46.210
I'm gonna send it to the Realtor
and set up an appointment.

10:49.344 --> 10:50.867
I look like
I'm being attacked by a bear,

10:50.911 --> 10:52.739
but I guess it'll do.

10:56.220 --> 10:59.702
Hi, hon. I know you're probably
grading papers right now,

10:59.746 --> 11:02.923
and I guarantee
it is more fun than this.

11:02.966 --> 11:04.838
There's a guy with a parrot,

11:04.881 --> 11:08.276
and it's been eyeing me
all night.

11:08.319 --> 11:10.408
I think I'm gonna have someone
walk me to my car.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.323
I don't trust this parrot.

11:14.543 --> 11:16.066
Hey.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.328
Hey.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.069
What are you doing here?
You're not single.

11:19.113 --> 11:22.420
Shh! Neville and I are gonna
pretend that we're single.

11:22.464 --> 11:24.379
He's gonna meet me here
in a little bit.

11:24.422 --> 11:27.164
I always wanted to get blasted
and have fun in a cemetery.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.776
I'm rehearsing for
when I throw my mom in a hole.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.169
Sounds like fun.

11:32.213 --> 11:34.302
I'm assuming Grandma
will be dead.

11:34.345 --> 11:35.912
Really doesn't matter
to me.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.437
What are you doing here?
Mm?

11:39.481 --> 11:41.613
Things not working out
with Professor Glen?

11:41.657 --> 11:43.572
No. Shh!

11:43.615 --> 11:44.834
One of my classmates --

11:44.878 --> 11:46.227
gray beanie over there
by the crypt,

11:46.270 --> 11:48.011
don't look --

11:48.055 --> 11:49.665
saw me out with him,

11:49.709 --> 11:51.754
so I have to
pretend to be single

11:51.798 --> 11:53.408
to throw her
off the trail.

11:53.451 --> 11:55.018
Which in Lanford means

11:55.062 --> 11:58.021
sipping an O'Doul's
on top of somebody's nana.

11:58.065 --> 12:01.764
Some of these old tombstones
are beautiful,

12:01.808 --> 12:05.986
you know, with the -- the carved
statues and everything.

12:06.029 --> 12:07.335
"Loving husband and father,

12:07.378 --> 12:09.641
may you finally
rest peacefully

12:09.685 --> 12:12.122
under the gaze of angels."

12:12.166 --> 12:13.254
That's so touching.

12:13.297 --> 12:14.603
Hey, take a picture
of me, huh?

12:14.646 --> 12:15.691
Okay.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.783
Oh, my God.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.221
Here.

12:24.265 --> 12:26.223
Put that on.
Good idea.

12:26.267 --> 12:27.224
Okay.

12:27.268 --> 12:28.835
Stick it.
Okay, okay.

12:28.878 --> 12:30.880
There you go.

12:36.059 --> 12:37.582
Okay, here.
Hold this.

12:37.626 --> 12:38.888
Hold it.
Okay, stick it on.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.803
Okay.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.283
Got it?Oh, good, good. Got it.

12:42.326 --> 12:43.937
Okay? Go.

12:46.678 --> 12:49.029
You know what?
You know what?

12:49.072 --> 12:50.291
I-I'm going this way.

12:50.334 --> 12:51.596
What?

12:51.640 --> 12:54.643
Hey, Becky,
isn't this great?

12:54.686 --> 12:56.166
Oh, it is.

12:56.210 --> 12:58.647
Listen, I couldn't say this
in front of the professor,

12:58.690 --> 13:02.042
but I asked you to come
because I was worried

13:02.085 --> 13:03.870
that you guys
might be involved.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.610
Even though
you're closer in age,

13:05.654 --> 13:08.265
there's still a huge
imbalance in power.

13:08.309 --> 13:10.833
What? No.

13:10.877 --> 13:14.010
Why would I take a crazy risk
and date my professor

13:14.054 --> 13:16.839
when there are so many
available guys here?

13:16.883 --> 13:19.886
That guy's parrot told me
I was a thirst trap.

13:19.929 --> 13:22.062
Oh, well,
that parrot's hammered.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.846
He tells everybody that.

13:23.890 --> 13:27.458
Okay, there's somebody
I want to introduce you to.

13:27.502 --> 13:28.720
We can meet after
for drinks.

13:28.764 --> 13:29.721
You'll love him.

13:29.765 --> 13:31.245
That's really sweet,

13:31.288 --> 13:33.290
but I like to pick out
my own guys.

13:34.074 --> 13:37.033
Look, if you're covering for
Professor Davis,

13:37.077 --> 13:38.643
it's not worth it.

13:38.687 --> 13:40.297
Someone's gonna figure it out
and go straight to the dean.

13:40.341 --> 13:41.864
Oh, my God.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.649
Why are you so obsessed with
Professor Davis?

13:44.693 --> 13:47.652
Maybe you're the one going out
with him and you're worried

13:47.696 --> 13:49.916
someone's gonna steal your
old man professor from you,

13:49.959 --> 13:51.874
you old man
professor lover.

13:53.571 --> 13:56.661
Okay, based on your reaction,
neither of us are dating him.

13:56.705 --> 13:59.969
So, uh, I guess
I'm meeting this guy.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.452
You're right.
This place is great.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.062
I know.

14:06.106 --> 14:09.457
Okay, we need a story about
how we met and everything.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.112
Well, how about this --
I owned a magazine,

14:12.155 --> 14:14.505
I hired you,
we lost the magazine,

14:14.549 --> 14:16.464
we ended up living in
your childhood bedroom,

14:16.507 --> 14:18.161
but now...

14:18.205 --> 14:19.946
we're doing this.

14:19.989 --> 14:22.078
The truth?
That's depressing.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.950
We're trying to get her
to sell us a house,

14:23.993 --> 14:25.908
not hang ourself
in the two-car garage

14:25.952 --> 14:28.171
with all the built-in
cabinets.

14:28.215 --> 14:30.130
Fine. You come up with
a better version.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.566
Okay.

14:31.609 --> 14:36.527
I am a rising exec
in the plastics industry,

14:36.571 --> 14:39.095
you own a chain of
hardware stores,

14:39.139 --> 14:42.011
and we've built a great life
together.

14:42.055 --> 14:43.926
Ah, that version of us
is awesome.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.843
I love that us.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.063
But this is
kind of weird.

14:50.106 --> 14:53.544
You know, this could've been
our place.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.764
Right.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.984
You and I
in our golden years,

14:58.027 --> 15:00.812
sitting on that patio swing,
uh, sipping a drink.

15:00.856 --> 15:02.162
Mm.

15:02.205 --> 15:04.555
Listening to Harris' kids
from different dads

15:04.599 --> 15:06.035
fighting
in the living room.

15:07.036 --> 15:08.603
Wondering if she's ever
coming back to get 'em.

15:08.646 --> 15:09.734
[ Sighs ]

15:09.778 --> 15:11.040
Hey.

15:11.084 --> 15:13.173
There's your handsome
Bigfoot.

15:13.216 --> 15:14.174
[ Ben chuckles ]

15:14.217 --> 15:16.567
Oh, uh,
this is my partner, Ben.

15:16.611 --> 15:18.178
Ben, this is Claire.

15:18.221 --> 15:20.006
We're a couple,
and I love her.

15:21.268 --> 15:23.531
And I love this house.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.881
Did you get my offer?
I went to the max with it.

15:25.925 --> 15:29.972
I did, and the seller thinks
you're a lovely couple.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.018
There's been
one slight change, though.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.150
There's another lovely couple,
and they're offering

15:34.194 --> 15:36.805
$20,000
over the asking price.

15:36.848 --> 15:39.068
[ Sighs ]
You got to be kidding me.

15:39.112 --> 15:41.201
Here's the thing.
If you could find a way

15:41.244 --> 15:43.333
to beat their offer,
even by a little,

15:43.377 --> 15:45.335
this place
could still be yours.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.598
Well, what do we know
about this other couple?

15:47.642 --> 15:49.818
I mean, maybe they're just
pretending to be a couple.

15:49.861 --> 15:51.428
I've heard of that
happening.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.213
They've been married
20 years.

15:53.256 --> 15:55.215
They rode over
on a tandem bike.

15:55.258 --> 15:57.826
[ Chuckles ]
How cute are they?

15:57.869 --> 15:59.349
Well, if they can't afford
two bikes,

15:59.393 --> 16:00.611
they can't afford a house.

16:00.655 --> 16:03.266
Might want to
look into that.

16:06.356 --> 16:08.271
Becky should be right up.

16:08.315 --> 16:12.449
So, I understand
you teach psychology.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.712
Did you have you a real job
before that?

16:15.887 --> 16:18.151
No, my greatest skill
was my thirst for knowledge.

16:18.194 --> 16:19.282
I hear ya.

16:19.326 --> 16:21.328
I feel the same way
about beer.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.374
Ready to go.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.159
We tried going to
a real restaurant,

16:26.202 --> 16:28.074
but we got busted
immediately.

16:28.117 --> 16:30.293
Yeah, a limited amount
of places we can go

16:30.337 --> 16:32.861
without being recognized,
but if it's worth it to Becky,

16:32.904 --> 16:34.210
it's worth it to me.

16:34.254 --> 16:35.864
Yeah, I saw on the news
where they gave a guy

16:35.907 --> 16:37.344
a whole new face.

16:37.387 --> 16:40.042
I like Becky's, but you can't be
all that attached to,

16:40.086 --> 16:41.957
you know, that.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.397
Uh, could we talk
for a sec?

16:47.441 --> 16:49.138
Sure.

16:49.182 --> 16:50.183
We have to lie to
everybody else.

16:50.226 --> 16:51.836
I don't want to
lie to you.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.621
Um...

16:53.664 --> 16:57.059
Connie was like Harriet the Spy
at that cemetery thing.

16:57.103 --> 17:01.194
And to shake her off,

17:01.237 --> 17:04.980
I ended up going on a date
with her friend.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.242
Oh.

17:06.286 --> 17:07.722
Sorry.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.289
I couldn't get out of it.

17:09.332 --> 17:11.160
No big deal.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.335
Really?

17:12.379 --> 17:13.902
I'm fine.

17:13.945 --> 17:15.991
Hey, let's get food that's easy
to eat in the car this time.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.253
Once you get
that pad Thai noodle

17:17.297 --> 17:18.472
between the seat
and the console,

17:18.515 --> 17:20.865
there's no
getting it out.

17:20.909 --> 17:22.867
So you're not jealous
at all?

17:22.911 --> 17:25.174
This doesn't have to
be a big deal,

17:25.218 --> 17:27.568
but it should be
at least a deal.

17:27.611 --> 17:29.265
No. All good.

17:29.309 --> 17:31.180
Uh,
what about turkey legs?

17:31.224 --> 17:33.791
We could, uh, drive around
with them in the cup holders.

17:33.835 --> 17:35.358
Stop talking about food.

17:35.402 --> 17:38.231
Don't you care about
this relationship at all?

17:38.274 --> 17:41.277
I need to know if I'm the only
one invested in this thing.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.105
Of course
I'm invested in this.

17:43.149 --> 17:45.499
Well, then, punch a wall

17:45.542 --> 17:47.109
or throw a beer
through the TV.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.241
Show me you care.

17:48.284 --> 17:49.590
I can't.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.113
What do you mean
you can't?

17:51.157 --> 17:53.942
Because I'm not gonna come down
on you for going on a date

17:53.985 --> 17:55.770
trying to protect

this is all
too much for you

and that you're gonna decide
it's not worth it

and -- and leave.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.564
What?

18:07.608 --> 18:09.740
Of course it's worth it.

Yeah, this is an impossible way
to have a relationship,

here because I want to be here.

what if I co-sign?

I remember this Darlene.

20:49.813 --> 20:51.511
Well, she's back,

Shame it didn't work out.
