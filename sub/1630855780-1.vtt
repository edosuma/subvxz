02:20.618 --> 02:22.316
<i>According
to the CDC,</i>

02:22.316 --> 02:25.493
<i>overdose deaths
have tripled...</i>

02:27.843 --> 02:30.802
<i>The numbers continue
to surge...</i>

04:31.358 --> 04:33.142
Barry?
One second.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.188
- Sheep and wool?
- Yeah.

04:36.798 --> 04:38.103
It's on my desk?

04:38.103 --> 04:41.019
- Sheep and wool?
- Yeah. I need it today.

04:41.019 --> 04:42.847
Oh, yeah.
I have that. Hum...

04:43.457 --> 04:45.633
Sorry. I got an insane
number of hits

04:45.633 --> 04:47.635
on those democratic donkey
videos I posted last week,

04:47.635 --> 04:50.594
so I've been trying to crank
those out, but I have it.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.030
Great, great...

05:00.822 --> 05:02.171
Listen, Thomas.

05:02.171 --> 05:03.999
What you're proposing,
however clickable,

05:03.999 --> 05:06.131
does it really feel like news?

05:06.958 --> 05:09.352
And that remains
our first obligation.

05:09.352 --> 05:11.702
We understand we're getting
clobbered on physical,

05:11.702 --> 05:14.792
but we need to use the election
as a barometer.

05:15.663 --> 05:17.447
If paper doesn't start moving
in six months,

05:17.447 --> 05:19.971
then we'll know the jig is up,

05:19.971 --> 05:22.539
but we have to follow
the rules now.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.541
It's a new age.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.326
That's not what
I'm fighting, here.

05:27.022 --> 05:29.677
I've been around long enough
to recognize a sea change...

05:30.547 --> 05:32.897
...but we have to be able
to do our job.

05:34.899 --> 05:37.075
Okay, so let's please move on,
so we can get

05:37.075 --> 05:39.991
to the very important work
I know you all have.

05:40.992 --> 05:43.255
Gill, you said it was
a heavy night?

05:44.344 --> 05:45.823
Sorry to interrupt.

05:46.433 --> 05:47.695
Toby?

05:48.304 --> 05:52.526
I need to talk to Marissa, something...

05:53.875 --> 05:55.137
What's going on?

05:55.137 --> 05:56.660
Something...
something's wrong.

06:01.665 --> 06:04.581
Okay, back to business.

06:04.581 --> 06:05.930
Gill, what do you got?

06:05.930 --> 06:07.497
Homicide in Arbor Hill,

06:07.497 --> 06:09.412
young kid gunned down...

07:12.170 --> 07:14.259
You can't blame yourself
for this one.

07:14.782 --> 07:15.957
Mm.

07:34.671 --> 07:36.847
Such a sudden loss.

07:38.283 --> 07:40.547
We pray that that this family
might find peace

07:40.547 --> 07:43.288
in the promise of God's
almighty kingdom.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.988
And while there are no words
which can undo

07:46.988 --> 07:50.426
the anger and despair
of such a tragedy,

07:50.426 --> 07:53.168
we pray that those
who have gathered

07:53.168 --> 07:56.998
show this grieving family
that they are not alone

07:56.998 --> 07:58.652
in their sorrow,

07:58.652 --> 08:02.743
that the son we have lost
is surrounded by love.

08:04.571 --> 08:07.748
Now, in such tragic circumstances,

08:07.748 --> 08:12.187
we're sometimes tempted
by rage to dismiss God's plan...

08:13.144 --> 08:15.059
...to lose our own place...

08:15.059 --> 08:16.800
- It's not worth it.
- ...in his mercy.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.063
But we must remember...

08:19.063 --> 08:20.717
You knew she'd be here.

08:20.717 --> 08:23.111
...that death is but another
step closer to God.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.602
- I'll never forget him.
- Thanks so much.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.519
Thank you.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.916
Mrs. Bennings,
I'm pregnant.

08:46.961 --> 08:49.572
Ma, what the fuck
are you doing?

09:07.677 --> 09:09.505
I'm sorry I hit you.

09:09.505 --> 09:11.420
I wouldn't if I had known.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.248
Yeah, I know.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.207
Just because of your
condition, doesn't mean I...

09:16.207 --> 09:17.774
Look, you don't need
to like me.

09:18.819 --> 09:22.866
Just this weird, shrivelled
little person.

09:24.215 --> 09:25.739
You sure it's his?

09:25.739 --> 09:27.697
Yeah, unless someone
snuck into my pussy

09:27.697 --> 09:28.959
and forgot it there.

09:32.484 --> 09:34.095
You know, I didn't
make him a junkie.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.357
No, I don't know that.

09:36.140 --> 09:37.838
I know you made him a thief.

09:37.838 --> 09:40.144
He had never stolen anything
from me in his life before you.

09:40.144 --> 09:41.755
Is this really
about the Vitamix?

09:41.755 --> 09:43.191
No. It's about the lying,

09:43.191 --> 09:45.628
stealing, money, jewelry,
and then the Vitamix.

09:45.628 --> 09:47.587
He gave that to me
for my fortieth birthday.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.414
- You never used it.
- And you did?

09:57.684 --> 09:59.120
How was he living?

10:01.644 --> 10:03.254
We got our own place
to get clean.

10:04.952 --> 10:06.344
He'd been having these freakouts

10:06.344 --> 10:09.260
and getting really sick,
and he was scared.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.047
Was he still dealing?

10:13.047 --> 10:14.701
Well, that's the thing,
he had stopped.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.441
When all that tainted shit
came through here,

10:16.441 --> 10:18.052
he decided it was time
to get away.

10:18.574 --> 10:21.011
He was looking to buy
this place near Chatham.

10:21.664 --> 10:23.231
He was excited
to start a family.

10:23.231 --> 10:24.624
Buy a place?

10:24.624 --> 10:26.321
How was he going to afford
to buy a place?

10:26.321 --> 10:28.715
He made it sound like Ducky
and him had it all figured out.

10:29.237 --> 10:30.847
He was still hanging out
with Ducky?

10:30.847 --> 10:32.022
Oh, yeah.

10:32.022 --> 10:34.590
He was like a brother
to both of us.

10:40.901 --> 10:45.079
Look, I didn't come here
to argue or beg or whatever.

10:45.079 --> 10:47.516
I'm here because
I loved Michael,

10:47.516 --> 10:49.736
and I'm sad he's gone,
and I know that you are too.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.608
Even if you're only capable
of being mad right now,

10:52.608 --> 10:53.827
I know that really,
you're just sad.

11:23.944 --> 11:25.641
Yeah, I miss him, too.

12:40.237 --> 12:42.022
You got it, Mike!

12:47.462 --> 12:49.769
It's okay, kiddo!
That was a good pitch!

13:35.510 --> 13:36.903
Who do you think
did it?

13:37.860 --> 13:40.558
Well, we've got a lead,

13:40.558 --> 13:42.691
but I don't think that's

13:42.691 --> 13:44.606
what you should be thinking
about right now.

13:48.392 --> 13:49.437
Ugh.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.091
Okay.

13:52.483 --> 13:54.050
You remember Mike's friend,
Ducky?

13:54.877 --> 13:56.270
Everett Dukowski.

13:56.270 --> 13:57.445
Yeah, of course.

13:58.402 --> 13:59.926
Well, at this point we're
pretty certain

13:59.926 --> 14:01.623
Everett's responsible
for bringing fentanyl

14:01.623 --> 14:02.711
to the South End.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.148
That shit is brutal.

14:06.671 --> 14:07.977
Junkies who get tied up in it

14:07.977 --> 14:10.110
don't last long,
one way or another.

14:13.504 --> 14:16.333
So, Michael
was tied up in it?

14:17.857 --> 14:20.772
We think him and Ducky might
have been in business together,

14:20.772 --> 14:23.123
selling this Mother's Milk shit,

14:23.123 --> 14:25.125
heroin, coke and fentanyl.

14:25.821 --> 14:29.520
Maybe there was a fight between
them or a deal gone wrong.

14:30.434 --> 14:31.958
What makes you think that?

14:31.958 --> 14:33.524
Mike was killed up the block

14:33.524 --> 14:35.570
from one of Ducky's
stash houses.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.572
And he matches a description
from a neighbour.

14:38.486 --> 14:41.706
When was the last time
you saw him? Mike?

14:42.664 --> 14:47.582
I don't know, three,
four months ago, maybe.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.933
Well, you got me beat.

15:08.864 --> 15:11.736
Jesus, you still haven't
thrown that thing out yet?

15:13.695 --> 15:14.870
It helps.

15:15.958 --> 15:18.004
I figured it would
make it harder.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.658
Not if you don't carry
a light.

15:23.096 --> 15:24.924
Alright, give me
a fucking drag.

15:32.279 --> 15:33.541
Mmm.

15:34.846 --> 15:35.935
Wow.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.807
Pretending kind of does help.

15:42.550 --> 15:45.988
I'll get Ducky, I promise.

16:23.504 --> 16:24.592
Come in!

16:30.380 --> 16:32.774
Marissa, what are you
doing here?

16:33.470 --> 16:36.343
Just wanted to make sure you
weren't too buried without me.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.825
Yeah, everything's
going okay.

16:42.044 --> 16:43.132
That's great.

16:43.698 --> 16:44.916
Um...

16:46.353 --> 16:48.790
We weren't expecting you back
for a month at least.

16:52.663 --> 16:53.969
How are you holding up?

16:55.144 --> 16:56.580
I want to come back to work.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.457
You took three months off
for Frank.

17:03.457 --> 17:05.459
Yeah, that was different.

17:05.459 --> 17:07.200
I need to come back.

17:08.679 --> 17:10.550
And tell me what that
looks like to you.

17:13.989 --> 17:15.772
Same thing as it did before.

17:16.731 --> 17:18.124
You hate editing.

17:21.127 --> 17:23.477
Walk out there right now and
look at the shit

17:23.477 --> 17:25.305
that Barry's been writing
since you've been gone.

17:25.305 --> 17:26.609
Fucking Barry?

17:27.959 --> 17:30.962
The one who turned the A and C
section into a donkey show?

17:30.962 --> 17:33.095
Okay, let's take
a second here.

17:33.095 --> 17:36.620
You hate Barry
and all those guys out there.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.318
Why?

17:39.058 --> 17:40.972
Because they aren't writers.

17:41.930 --> 17:44.585
They're all about numbers
and formatting

17:44.585 --> 17:46.587
and words per click,
or whatever.

17:47.457 --> 17:49.938
Hell, you barely know
what the Internet does.

17:51.592 --> 17:54.334
Marissa, you are my best writer,

17:54.334 --> 17:56.858
but for some reason,
you refuse to write.

17:57.815 --> 18:01.950
Take your time, but write.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.926
Alright, clean.

18:22.666 --> 18:24.581
Bullshit, it's touching
my ball.

18:24.581 --> 18:26.235
Watch and learn, sucker.

18:27.845 --> 18:29.717
- Lucky.

18:29.717 --> 18:31.545
I learned from the best.

18:31.545 --> 18:32.546
Another.

18:36.550 --> 18:37.899
Alright, your shot.

18:41.294 --> 18:43.034
She didn't even want to join.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.559
She didn't want to intrude.

18:46.386 --> 18:49.128
She said we should have
some alone time together

18:49.128 --> 18:50.738
to just grieve.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.654
Is that what we're doing?

19:01.009 --> 19:02.271
You going to be okay, Mom?

19:03.011 --> 19:05.274
One ball at a time.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.473
Watch this, to the left!

20:14.865 --> 20:15.997
Let's make this quick!

20:26.050 --> 20:27.356
A leather case.

20:33.014 --> 20:34.755
It's got to be here somewhere.

20:49.857 --> 20:51.424
There's a back room.

20:52.903 --> 20:54.209
Oh, fuck.

20:56.559 --> 20:57.734
There!

22:14.637 --> 22:15.899
What are you doing?

22:16.726 --> 22:18.685
I've always wanted
to do that.

22:25.126 --> 22:26.693
Sounds weird, doesn't it?

22:27.650 --> 22:29.348
What's that?

22:29.348 --> 22:32.176
Paige said that Michael,
Ducky and her

22:32.176 --> 22:35.266
were moving into a farm,
or a house,

22:35.266 --> 22:36.616
something in Chatham?

22:37.443 --> 22:39.923
Mike, a farmer?

22:41.882 --> 22:44.450
I know.
It doesn't make sense.

22:46.713 --> 22:49.019
Listen, you've got to be
careful with that girl.

22:58.115 --> 22:59.465
What the fuck are you
doing here?

22:59.465 --> 23:00.770
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

23:00.770 --> 23:02.163
Sorry, I meant to stay awake.

23:02.163 --> 23:03.425
What are you doing here?

23:03.425 --> 23:05.340
Someone broke into my house,

23:05.340 --> 23:08.604
and I just didn't have
anywhere else to go.

23:10.563 --> 23:11.868
Were you hurt?

23:11.868 --> 23:13.392
Did you see who it was?

23:13.392 --> 23:15.742
No, but I found this.

23:17.265 --> 23:20.399
Hum... I think it's what
they were looking for.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.705
I found it right before
they came in.

23:23.924 --> 23:25.099
What is that?

23:25.578 --> 23:28.145
That's about $50,000 worth
of dirty heroin.

23:44.335 --> 23:45.772
I like the other way better.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.165
Me too.

23:48.165 --> 23:49.645
This baby business is tough

23:49.645 --> 23:51.908
but Whatever works, right?
- Right.

24:00.351 --> 24:01.788
How was she tonight?

24:02.484 --> 24:03.442
Drunk.

24:05.356 --> 24:06.401
Did she cry?

24:07.924 --> 24:10.579
She said she'd already
cried for him.

24:11.624 --> 24:13.190
The drinking isn't
going to help.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.063
Remember how bad it got
after Frank?

24:16.063 --> 24:18.979
- Yeah. I definitely remember.

24:20.807 --> 24:22.591
Hey, Mom.
What's going on?

24:24.375 --> 24:26.552
Yeah, I recognize the logo.

24:28.292 --> 24:29.990
This is the shit
I was telling you about.

24:29.990 --> 24:31.687
You're not going
to charge her, right?

24:33.472 --> 24:34.603
No.

24:35.648 --> 24:36.910
You did the right thing.

24:37.780 --> 24:39.869
Is this everything?
- Everything?

24:41.654 --> 24:44.265
Any chance you saw the person
that broke in?

24:44.265 --> 24:45.962
No, I got out pretty quick.

24:48.965 --> 24:50.532
So, what does this mean?

24:50.532 --> 24:52.752
- I'm going to take this...
- This means shit just got real.

24:53.448 --> 24:54.841
Somebody called him that night.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.277
He left all freaked out,

24:56.277 --> 24:58.540
I had no idea what was going on,
and then, bam!

24:58.540 --> 25:00.455
You know who called him,
Paige?

25:01.543 --> 25:02.979
It was Ducky.

25:07.027 --> 25:08.028
Alright?

25:09.159 --> 25:10.596
We checked his phone.

25:13.033 --> 25:13.990
Thank you, Paige.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.210
I'm going to take this
to the station.

25:16.210 --> 25:17.298
Okay?

25:27.569 --> 25:29.789
I'll get you a blanket
for the couch.

25:30.572 --> 25:31.921
Thank you.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.379
Did my puking wake you up?

25:56.380 --> 25:57.381
No.

25:57.381 --> 25:58.731
You feeling any better?

25:59.993 --> 26:01.385
Not at all.

26:04.258 --> 26:05.868
Did you ever have
any weird cravings

26:05.868 --> 26:07.261
when you were pregnant?

26:09.872 --> 26:11.395
Necco wafers.

26:11.395 --> 26:12.962
What the hell's
a necco wafer?

26:12.962 --> 26:16.183
It's like this little
disk-shaped candy, you know?

26:16.183 --> 26:18.794
It tastes like...
tastes like chalk.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.796
I must have eaten
my body weight in them.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.016
I want Play-doh.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.061
Play-doh?

26:25.845 --> 26:27.237
That can't be good for the baby.

26:27.237 --> 26:28.978
Kids eat it all the time
and they're fine.

26:30.023 --> 26:32.329
Well, you should ask
your doctor about that.

26:36.246 --> 26:37.291
Yeah.

26:38.466 --> 26:39.728
You have a doctor, right?

26:40.816 --> 26:43.645
Yeah, well, we went to one
straight when we found out,

26:43.645 --> 26:45.604
but the budget
was pretty tight, so...

26:46.387 --> 26:49.303
We were saving up to go again.

26:49.303 --> 26:52.175
Come on, you need
to see a doctor.

26:52.175 --> 26:54.830
- What, right now?
- No, like a month ago,

26:54.830 --> 26:57.572
but yeah, now's better
than later.

27:01.315 --> 27:03.796
Uh, I have to stop by work,
but it won't take long.

27:04.492 --> 27:06.799
I'll give you a ride home
when I'm done.

27:07.887 --> 27:09.671
Depends on what you mean
by "home".

27:13.370 --> 27:15.068
- I'll see you soon.
- See you.

27:20.726 --> 27:22.902
<i>Pick up the phone,
come on!</i>

27:22.902 --> 27:26.557
<i>I just wanted to say that
I figured some things out</i>

27:26.557 --> 27:30.387
<i>and I have a plan, you know.</i>

27:32.215 --> 27:35.044
<i>They said it made sense. I...</i>

27:36.829 --> 27:40.746
<i>I know you were right
to kick me out of the house...</i>

27:42.443 --> 27:46.012
<i>...but, you know, a little bit
of fucking cash right now</i>

27:46.012 --> 27:48.231
<i>would really go a long way
to getting...</i>

27:49.537 --> 27:51.147
<i>I know you're in the house!</i>

27:51.147 --> 27:53.541
<i>I can see you moving
in the house!</i>

27:54.847 --> 27:56.892
<i>Let me in, it's my shit!</i>

27:56.892 --> 27:59.329
<i>You changed the fucking
locks, Mom!</i>

27:59.329 --> 28:01.505
<i>What the... Mom!</i>

28:01.505 --> 28:04.508
<i>Hey, Mom, I can't expect you
to pick up this time.</i>

28:04.508 --> 28:08.382
<i>I just want to say...</i>
<i>Happy birthday...</i>

28:08.382 --> 28:09.992
<i>So does Paige.</i>

28:09.992 --> 28:13.866
<i>Um, I want you to know that
we're doing a lot better.</i>

28:13.866 --> 28:16.956
<i>Um, there's something I want
to tell you in person.</i>

28:18.392 --> 28:19.828
<i>I love you so much.</i>

28:20.829 --> 28:22.178
<i>Bye.</i>

28:40.283 --> 28:41.850
Are you fucking serious?

28:46.202 --> 28:47.508
Paige?

28:48.161 --> 28:49.292
It's Gina.

28:49.292 --> 28:50.424
Hey!

28:50.990 --> 28:52.295
What are you doing here?

28:53.166 --> 28:55.342
Um, same as me, I guess.

28:55.342 --> 28:57.387
Marissa's supposed
to be picking me up.

28:57.387 --> 28:58.693
Oh.

28:59.563 --> 29:01.652
Do you mind if I join you?

29:02.566 --> 29:03.742
Sure.

29:09.225 --> 29:10.400
Ugh...

29:12.838 --> 29:14.056
I like your necklace.

29:16.189 --> 29:17.581
I stole it from Target.

29:17.581 --> 29:20.584
- It suits you, I guess.

29:21.760 --> 29:22.804
Thanks.

29:23.892 --> 29:26.155
Uh, I just mean...

29:26.155 --> 29:28.027
No, it's okay.
I know what you meant.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.072
Sorry.

29:33.467 --> 29:34.860
Can I ask you a question?

29:35.599 --> 29:37.688
What's it like being
married to a cop?

29:39.560 --> 29:41.910
Um, it's not so different
from anything else.

29:44.565 --> 29:46.045
There's just a part of you
that accepts

29:46.045 --> 29:47.786
he might not come home one day.

29:50.353 --> 29:52.355
Sounds a lot like dating
a junkie.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.406
She's not fucking coming.

30:00.015 --> 30:01.234
I can give you a ride.

30:02.888 --> 30:04.585
- You sure?
- Yeah, of course.

30:29.566 --> 30:31.133
Didn't go so well
at work, huh?

30:31.655 --> 30:33.005
Sorry, I forgot.

30:34.267 --> 30:35.921
You had important things
to do.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.748
- Stop it.

30:37.748 --> 30:39.489
No, you fucking stop it!

30:39.489 --> 30:40.882
Excuse me?

30:40.882 --> 30:42.797
You just keep fucking hiding
from everything,

30:42.797 --> 30:44.103
and it's really fucking hard
to look at.

30:44.103 --> 30:45.321
It's shitty for all of us.

30:45.321 --> 30:46.583
Just stop pretending
you're alone.

30:54.722 --> 30:56.680
I want to go back to Al-Anon.

30:57.594 --> 30:58.857
Well, that's a good start.

30:59.901 --> 31:02.773
I'll come with you, make sure
it's not a drunk promise.

31:02.773 --> 31:03.862
Mm.

31:20.226 --> 31:21.792
For what it's worth,
Michael used to say

31:21.792 --> 31:23.446
you were a really good writer.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.233
Oh, yeah?

31:29.757 --> 31:31.237
What else did he say?

31:35.719 --> 31:37.547
He said that before
Frank died,

31:37.547 --> 31:39.158
he remembered you were happy.

31:44.859 --> 31:46.252
When did he say that?

31:46.252 --> 31:47.427
All the time.

31:48.167 --> 31:49.777
I wish I got to meet him.

31:51.170 --> 31:54.042
No, well then you'd know...

31:54.042 --> 31:55.957
you'd know what
an asshole he was.

31:57.045 --> 31:58.699
Even when he got sick?

31:58.699 --> 32:00.657
Especially when he got sick.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.096
Yeah, but...

32:07.012 --> 32:08.535
Did you ever stop missing him?

32:13.018 --> 32:14.106
Never.

32:18.719 --> 32:20.547
Well, that's a drag.

32:24.159 --> 32:25.944
Oh, god.

32:27.858 --> 32:29.773
- Who's that?
- That's Toby.

32:29.773 --> 32:32.080
- Oh, man.
- Look at his hair.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.473
Sweet.

32:33.473 --> 32:35.040
We should get yours
one of these.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.085
It makes nursing easier.
- Yeah?

32:48.662 --> 32:49.968
I'm going to bed.

32:50.794 --> 32:51.926
Okay.

32:52.709 --> 32:53.710
Goodnight.

32:54.233 --> 32:55.364
Goodnight.

33:09.683 --> 33:11.815
I think I still have
one of these at the house,

33:11.815 --> 33:13.034
believe it or not.

33:13.034 --> 33:14.296
Mm-hmm.

33:16.037 --> 33:17.778
Oh, hey, we could use these,

33:17.778 --> 33:19.823
especially if we go
with the pump.

33:20.781 --> 33:21.912
Yeah...

33:22.522 --> 33:23.653
Nothing?

33:24.611 --> 33:27.657
Okay, well, I'm glad it's
my baby we're shopping for.

33:27.657 --> 33:29.137
Oh, fuck yes!

33:29.137 --> 33:30.312
Excuse me?

33:31.357 --> 33:33.098
- We got a lead.
- A what?

33:33.098 --> 33:34.534
We got a lead.

33:37.885 --> 33:40.670
Let them do their investigation,
but in the meantime,

33:40.670 --> 33:43.325
it can't hurt to get the story
ourselves, you know?

33:43.325 --> 33:45.371
I mean, maybe it'll be the same
thing they told the cops,

33:45.371 --> 33:47.068
but I want to hear it myself.

33:47.068 --> 33:48.852
Listen, it's something
we can actually do

33:48.852 --> 33:50.811
instead of sitting
around moping.

33:50.811 --> 33:52.160
It's a lead!

33:52.160 --> 33:54.032
You know, this isn't
ethical or legal.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.337
Sure it is.

34:14.007 --> 34:15.053
- Hey.
- Jeremy?

34:15.053 --> 34:16.054
Come on in.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.185
I heard the shots,

34:17.185 --> 34:18.839
but Jack was the one who saw it.

34:20.101 --> 34:21.929
He's a little out of it
from his meds.

34:22.625 --> 34:24.366
Grandpa sits a lot
because of his hip.

34:24.366 --> 34:26.150
He was sitting right
there when it happened.

34:26.150 --> 34:28.152
Hi, Jack, nice to meet you.

34:28.152 --> 34:29.415
I'm Marissa.

34:29.415 --> 34:31.504
I work for the Times Union.

34:32.418 --> 34:34.202
So, you saw what happened?

34:35.551 --> 34:38.467
Grandpa, you remember
what happened the other night?

34:39.860 --> 34:41.427
Marissa's son was shot.

34:41.427 --> 34:43.385
He was killed, remember?

34:43.385 --> 34:45.866
He was the one you saw die
in front of the house.

34:45.866 --> 34:47.215
That's too bad.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.261
I'm sorry.

34:49.261 --> 34:51.567
I thought you said he saw
what happened that night.

34:51.567 --> 34:53.960
Come on, nothing?
- Paige, hey.

34:53.960 --> 34:55.963
Jack, just think.
Please, just think.

34:55.963 --> 34:57.965
- Let's not be rude.
- I'm not being rude.

34:58.618 --> 35:01.577
Grandpa, you said there was
someone outside yelling,

35:01.577 --> 35:02.883
and then...
- With the truck?

35:02.883 --> 35:04.450
Yeah, with the truck.

35:08.323 --> 35:12.327
The boy was standing in the
street yelling his head off.

35:12.327 --> 35:14.895
Then, I heard the truck.

35:15.983 --> 35:18.290
I think the kid he was
calling for lives there,

35:18.290 --> 35:20.161
because I've seen him
there before.

35:20.161 --> 35:21.467
Ducky!

35:34.741 --> 35:36.046
Hope
that was helpful.

36:18.263 --> 36:20.352
- Hey, Laurie.
- Hey.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.354
How you been?

36:23.485 --> 36:24.878
Just getting by.

36:24.878 --> 36:27.185
Thank you for being here, everyone.

36:28.229 --> 36:31.101
Come, come into the circle.

36:31.798 --> 36:33.147
Have a seat.

36:33.147 --> 36:34.844
It's a sunny day and we're all
in a basement,

36:34.844 --> 36:38.108
but we're going to get to know
each other and talk.

36:39.675 --> 36:43.331
I see some new faces, welcome.

36:43.331 --> 36:46.900
And some who we haven't seen
for a while.

36:47.901 --> 36:49.424
It's good to have you back.

36:50.469 --> 36:51.687
Our...

36:52.819 --> 36:54.777
We had you in our prayers.

36:54.777 --> 37:00.261
Uh, okay, so, who wants
to start us off today?

37:03.395 --> 37:05.005
Any thoughts? Any...

37:05.353 --> 37:07.312
Oh, Laurie!

37:10.793 --> 37:17.191
I lost my daughter, Jessica,
about three months ago now.

37:20.673 --> 37:21.848
Haven't...

37:22.849 --> 37:24.416
... haven't really felt capable

37:24.416 --> 37:27.070
of sharing too much about it
until now.

37:28.115 --> 37:29.856
I'm sure a lot of you
know the feeling.

37:31.771 --> 37:32.946
Mm.

37:34.164 --> 37:37.124
Jessica was a hard kid to raise.

37:38.473 --> 37:43.130
I think, sometimes, we paint
our kids as saints.

37:46.394 --> 37:49.049
Jessica was not a saint...

37:50.050 --> 37:51.269
...the opposite.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.314
She was kind of a pain
in the ass.

37:56.186 --> 37:59.538
So, anyway, the morning
I found her,

37:59.538 --> 38:01.061
I was about to go to work,

38:01.061 --> 38:03.106
so I went to her room
to wake her up.

38:18.339 --> 38:22.169
You don't realize it
at the time...

38:23.953 --> 38:27.217
...but that walk to the door
is the last time

38:27.217 --> 38:30.525
you are who you think you are.

38:33.354 --> 38:35.008
But you don't know.

38:36.052 --> 38:37.358
I didn't know.

38:39.273 --> 38:43.799
So, I opened the door,
and there she is,

38:43.799 --> 38:47.150
laying on the bed,
fully clothed,

38:47.150 --> 38:49.152
candles lit around her.

38:50.980 --> 38:54.157
At first, I was furious.

38:54.157 --> 38:58.466
You know, she had fallen asleep
with candles burning.

38:59.119 --> 39:02.427
And I start screaming at her,
"Are you crazy?

39:03.341 --> 39:05.343
You're going to burn
the house down."

39:13.916 --> 39:19.226
And then, I see it, a tiny
little bag on the carpet.

39:20.009 --> 39:23.273
And I... I just look at it.

39:26.189 --> 39:28.801
I remember the logo on the bag.

39:28.801 --> 39:31.499
It's seared into my head,
you know?

39:33.283 --> 39:35.198
M.M.

39:36.635 --> 39:39.159
When you see something
like that,

39:39.159 --> 39:41.379
you know, everything cracks.

39:42.597 --> 39:44.904
The stories you made crack.

39:45.774 --> 39:49.387
Who you thought
your kid was cracks.

39:49.387 --> 39:53.434
Who you thought you were cracks.

39:54.957 --> 39:57.307
You're that family, now.

39:59.092 --> 40:02.400
You never realized
you were that family.

40:22.202 --> 40:24.770
Hey, I'm going to walk back.

40:26.162 --> 40:28.164
You should offer Laurie a ride.

40:28.164 --> 40:30.993
Uh, I'm pretty sure she wants
to be left alone.

40:30.993 --> 40:32.560
No, that's what you want.

40:33.735 --> 40:35.607
I'm going to check
some of Ducky's spots.

40:49.359 --> 40:51.492
Hey, Laurie. Hey!

40:51.492 --> 40:52.711
Marissa!

40:52.711 --> 40:54.277
Do you want a ride?

41:27.180 --> 41:29.530
I can't believe I'm actually
going to ask this, but...

41:31.532 --> 41:33.055
...could I interview you?

41:33.926 --> 41:35.449
Interview me?

41:35.449 --> 41:38.321
You... put some things
into words

41:38.321 --> 41:40.541
I haven't been able to yet.

41:40.541 --> 41:43.544
You know all that stuff
is confidential, right?

41:43.544 --> 41:46.547
Yeah, of course.
That's the point.

41:46.547 --> 41:49.681
I want you to talk to me on the
record, you know, mom to mom.

41:50.377 --> 41:51.552
For what?

41:53.685 --> 41:56.078
Well, I don't know yet.

41:56.078 --> 41:59.865
But baybe if I write it,
I'll know.

42:02.302 --> 42:03.521
Thanks again.

42:04.173 --> 42:06.349
Hey, what's going on here?

42:06.349 --> 42:11.354
This is a safe injection site
and needle exchange for users.

42:12.312 --> 42:13.574
What?

42:13.574 --> 42:16.490
Maybe if my baby had gone
to one of these

42:16.490 --> 42:20.276
instead of hiding in her room,
she wouldn't have died.

42:22.061 --> 42:24.367
This at least takes
that danger away.

42:28.371 --> 42:30.199
You should come check it out.

42:31.549 --> 42:35.161
If helping and healing
is actually what you want,

42:35.161 --> 42:37.990
you really need to see it
for what it is.

43:06.845 --> 43:09.325
- Alright, ready?
- Yeah.

43:18.900 --> 43:21.424
Hey, John.
Hey, Diane.

43:21.424 --> 43:24.732
Marissa, this is Diane.

43:24.732 --> 43:29.215
She coordinates the distribution
of fentanyl test strips.

43:30.651 --> 43:33.872
She tells me where to go,
how to help,

43:33.872 --> 43:36.178
how to stay out of...

43:36.178 --> 43:37.571
Hey, you okay?

43:37.571 --> 43:38.920
Marissa?

43:38.920 --> 43:41.357
Uh, excuse me.

43:51.454 --> 43:52.978
<i>You're looking
for Toby Bennings.</i>

43:52.978 --> 43:54.632
<i>Leave a message.</i>

43:54.632 --> 43:58.287
Ducky! Ducky, I just want
to talk to you!

44:14.303 --> 44:15.653
Ducky!

46:01.367 --> 46:03.021
- Paige!
- Hey.

46:04.674 --> 46:06.328
- Is everything alright?
- Yeah.

46:06.328 --> 46:08.113
Yeah. Everything's cool, sorry.

46:08.113 --> 46:10.942
I just came by to talk
to Gina, actually.

46:10.942 --> 46:15.337
Uh, she went out
with some friends after work,

46:15.337 --> 46:17.644
so she's not going to be back
until later.

46:17.644 --> 46:19.124
Oh, okay, of course.

46:19.124 --> 46:20.778
Sorry for being creepy.

46:20.778 --> 46:22.605
I just thought it would be nice
to talk to someone

46:22.605 --> 46:24.477
who doesn't actually feel
like a parent

46:24.477 --> 46:27.393
and, like, actually has
their shit together.

46:27.393 --> 46:28.611
Yeah, I get you.

46:28.611 --> 46:30.048
I'll tell her you stopped by.
- Okay.

46:30.048 --> 46:31.876
- Have a good night.
- See you.

46:35.401 --> 46:38.708
Uh, Paige, if you want,
you can come in.

46:38.708 --> 46:40.406
- Yeah?
- In a way...

46:41.363 --> 46:46.020
...we're kind of family now,
so... come on.

47:16.921 --> 47:18.836
Fuck, you alright?

47:19.575 --> 47:21.839
I thought I killed you.

47:23.579 --> 47:25.407
What the fuck are you doing
following me?

47:27.627 --> 47:28.933
You killed my son.

47:28.933 --> 47:30.760
No, I fucking didn't.

47:30.760 --> 47:32.719
You fucking believe that shit?

47:36.549 --> 47:38.377
So, what happened, then?

47:40.074 --> 47:41.641
What happened, Ducky?

47:43.034 --> 47:45.036
Look, all I know
is somebody called me

47:45.036 --> 47:46.907
and told me Mike was in trouble

47:46.907 --> 47:49.040
and that he needed
to get out of his house.

47:49.910 --> 47:51.999
So, I called him
and I told him to meet me

47:51.999 --> 47:53.609
at the squat house right away.

47:53.609 --> 47:55.437
I thought I was protecting him.

47:55.437 --> 47:57.135
What the fuck would you do?

47:57.135 --> 47:58.832
I didn't know they were going
to fucking kill him.

47:58.832 --> 48:00.007
That's convenient.

48:00.007 --> 48:01.879
No. It sucks, Mrs. Bennings.

48:03.793 --> 48:05.795
I was his fucking best friend.

48:05.795 --> 48:07.928
Then, who killed him?

48:10.452 --> 48:12.498
I never met the guy,
but he drives around

48:12.498 --> 48:13.934
in this white truck

48:13.934 --> 48:16.197
and has this fucking
stupid tattoo on his hand.

48:17.764 --> 48:18.896
That's all I know.

48:22.377 --> 48:24.118
Nobody fucking believes me.

48:26.077 --> 48:27.426
Ducky!

48:27.426 --> 48:29.863
Hey, you! What are
you doing in there?

48:38.611 --> 48:40.395
Holy shit, Mom.
Are you okay?

48:40.395 --> 48:41.831
Yeah, I'm fine.

48:41.831 --> 48:43.137
I just needed to talk to you.

48:43.137 --> 48:44.443
Fuck, Marissa, what happened?

48:47.185 --> 48:50.449
I... found your friend Ducky.

48:51.276 --> 48:53.147
- What?
- Yeah.

48:55.062 --> 48:56.672
Yeah, he was at the food bank.

48:56.672 --> 49:00.502
I followed him to the train
yard down on Church Street.

49:00.502 --> 49:01.634
You followed him?

49:01.634 --> 49:02.940
He snuck up

49:02.940 --> 49:04.376
and hit me with something.

49:04.376 --> 49:05.638
He could have killed you, Mom.

49:05.638 --> 49:07.466
I know, but he talked to me.

49:07.466 --> 49:08.902
Talked to you?

49:11.165 --> 49:12.775
You got any whisky?

49:12.775 --> 49:14.473
I'm going to go out
and look for him.

49:14.473 --> 49:15.648
He couldn't have gotten far.

49:19.391 --> 49:20.783
You sure it was him?

49:21.393 --> 49:22.611
I'm sure.

49:23.221 --> 49:24.874
Well, did he say anything?

49:24.874 --> 49:27.268
He said it was a guy
with a tattoo on his hand,

49:27.268 --> 49:28.878
that he didn't do it.

49:28.878 --> 49:30.141
No shit he didn't do it.

49:30.141 --> 49:31.446
He's not a fucking murderer.

49:31.446 --> 49:33.231
You expect me to believe
that the man

49:33.231 --> 49:35.407
who just knocked me unconscious
isn't a violent person?

49:35.407 --> 49:37.583
What would you do if someone
followed you like that?

49:37.583 --> 49:39.541
You really don't understand.

49:39.541 --> 49:41.326
He told Mike to meet him there.

49:41.326 --> 49:42.980
He set him up, Paige.

51:17.117 --> 51:18.379
Ducky!

51:25.908 --> 51:27.171
Ducky!

51:38.182 --> 51:39.270
Hello!

52:04.556 --> 52:05.861
Ducky!

54:26.132 --> 54:27.699
Hey, sorry, I was downstairs.

54:27.699 --> 54:30.789
- Can I come inside?
- Uh, yeah, okay.

54:34.271 --> 54:35.707
What's happening?
You alright?

54:35.707 --> 54:36.838
Ducky's dead.

54:38.362 --> 54:41.713
Uh, how do you know?

54:42.757 --> 54:45.325
Because I went to that old
house and I found him.

54:45.325 --> 54:46.979
He killed himself.

54:49.198 --> 54:50.852
Fuck, okay...

54:50.852 --> 54:52.071
Uh...

54:52.071 --> 54:53.333
Oh, god.

54:55.770 --> 54:57.772
Alright, look, just sit down.

54:57.772 --> 54:59.992
I'll get you some water.
You okay?

54:59.992 --> 55:01.298
Yeah.

55:05.563 --> 55:06.999
Just have a drink.

55:06.999 --> 55:08.435
Take a few deep breaths.

55:12.874 --> 55:14.441
Fuck.

55:15.790 --> 55:17.488
Was anyone else there?

55:17.488 --> 55:18.837
No, it was just me.

55:18.837 --> 55:20.142
And, um...

55:21.143 --> 55:24.190
Yeah, I saw his body,
and then I left.

55:24.930 --> 55:26.279
Got it, okay.

55:26.801 --> 55:29.674
Uh, why didn't you call 911?

55:29.674 --> 55:31.719
Because I knew I wasn't
supposed to be there.

55:31.719 --> 55:34.026
That's why I'm here.
I knew that you could help.

55:34.026 --> 55:35.854
Sure. I'm sorry.

55:35.854 --> 55:38.465
I'm really sorry for your loss.

55:39.074 --> 55:41.250
I'll get someone to go around
there right away.

55:41.250 --> 55:45.690
You just take it easy
and make yourself at home.

55:45.690 --> 55:47.909
I'm just going to be
two minutes, alright?
- Okay.

56:37.872 --> 56:39.047
Oh...

57:02.070 --> 57:03.202
Fuck.

57:37.279 --> 57:39.325
Hi, I need someone to go
to the address

57:39.325 --> 57:42.763
and just check it out
right away.

57:45.505 --> 57:46.898
Yeah, that's right.

57:48.290 --> 57:51.163
I need someone to go to 1-2-5-8
and check if possible.

57:57.778 --> 57:59.388
This one's personal.

59:25.518 --> 59:26.693
Paige?

01:00:04.992 --> 01:00:06.603
Paige, give me the phone.
- Get back.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:08.169
- Just give me the phone.
- No.

01:00:08.169 --> 01:00:09.867
- Give me the phone.
- Back the fuck off.

01:00:09.867 --> 01:00:11.303
- Paige...
- No.

01:00:18.658 --> 01:00:19.964
Listen to me.

01:00:19.964 --> 01:00:21.879
You don't understand
what's going on here.

01:00:21.879 --> 01:00:23.445
- Toby, no.
- Please.

01:00:23.445 --> 01:00:25.143
- Back up.
- I can explain.

01:00:25.143 --> 01:00:27.319
- Back the fuck up.
- Listen to me.

01:00:27.319 --> 01:00:29.060
Just give me the phone.
- Back the fuck away.

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.452
I'm telling you.
- Back the fuck up!

01:00:30.452 --> 01:00:32.106
I can explain!
I can explain this. Paige!

01:00:32.106 --> 01:00:33.281
Just calm down!

01:00:33.281 --> 01:00:35.501
Just stop, okay!

01:00:35.501 --> 01:00:37.329
Calm down, give me the phone.

01:00:37.329 --> 01:00:39.244
Fuck you!
Get the fuck away from me!

01:00:39.244 --> 01:00:41.115
- Paige!
- Just back the fuck up!

01:00:41.115 --> 01:00:42.726
Get out of my way!
Don't touch me!

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:44.162
- Just give me...
- Away!

01:00:44.162 --> 01:00:46.294
- Give me the fucking phone!
- Get the fuck off me!

01:00:46.294 --> 01:00:47.905
Give me the phone!
Paige!

01:00:47.905 --> 01:00:49.123
Stop!

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.361
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:01:09.361 --> 01:01:11.363
Paige! Paige!

01:01:11.363 --> 01:01:13.365
Hey, hey.

01:01:13.365 --> 01:01:15.715
Oh, fuck.

01:01:18.022 --> 01:01:19.110
Oh, fuck.

01:01:56.538 --> 01:01:57.670
Fuck.

01:02:17.124 --> 01:02:18.256
Fuck.

01:03:06.347 --> 01:03:07.784
Hey, I'm home.

01:03:09.437 --> 01:03:10.525
Gina!

01:03:10.525 --> 01:03:12.179
Call an ambulance, quick!

01:03:12.179 --> 01:03:14.225
Gina, it's Paige,
call an ambulance!

01:03:14.225 --> 01:03:15.835
She fell in the bathroom.

01:03:15.835 --> 01:03:17.663
I think she OD'd!
She's bleeding!

01:03:19.273 --> 01:03:20.797
Just get an ambulance
right now!

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.059
Okay, okay!

01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:25.497
Hi, um...

01:03:27.499 --> 01:03:29.109
Fuck, fuck!

01:03:33.853 --> 01:03:37.074
Toby, I think Paige
is hiding something.

01:03:37.074 --> 01:03:38.597
Yeah, you're right.

01:03:39.293 --> 01:03:41.208
She's using again
and she overdosed.

01:03:41.208 --> 01:03:42.601
What?

01:03:42.601 --> 01:03:44.690
She's on her way
to the hospital right now.

01:03:45.865 --> 01:03:47.562
<i>Meet us at St. Peter's.</i>

01:04:33.391 --> 01:04:35.523
The forceps, please.

01:04:40.528 --> 01:04:42.139
A little more space.

01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:45.490
Alright.

01:04:49.842 --> 01:04:50.887
Alright.

01:04:52.366 --> 01:04:53.715
We have a flatline.

01:04:53.715 --> 01:04:54.803
Get the crash cart.

01:08:33.457 --> 01:08:34.457
Hi, cat.

01:08:35.023 --> 01:08:36.024
There's a baby.

01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:37.809
Make acquaintance.

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:35.171
Jesus Christ.
You scared me.

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:37.085
Sorry, I let myself in.

01:09:37.694 --> 01:09:38.826
You okay?

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:40.959
It's a nice room.

01:09:42.743 --> 01:09:44.745
Perfect for the little angel.

01:09:46.834 --> 01:09:48.618
I've got to get her
her bottle.

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:50.577
Here, come on.

01:09:52.578 --> 01:09:53.580
Here.

01:09:57.628 --> 01:09:59.325
There you go.

01:10:01.762 --> 01:10:02.937
Yeah.

01:10:07.333 --> 01:10:08.552
What's going on?

01:10:11.337 --> 01:10:12.860
I found something.

01:10:24.655 --> 01:10:27.745
Marissa, I found it under
the stairs, in the basement.

01:10:28.528 --> 01:10:31.227
I thought it was some kind
of miracle...

01:10:32.358 --> 01:10:35.231
...like a gift,
left as a reminder.

01:10:36.188 --> 01:10:37.407
But then I saw the blood.

01:10:37.407 --> 01:10:40.366
- How...
- I don't know...

01:10:41.846 --> 01:10:45.023
I've been trying to think
of every possible reason.

01:10:45.023 --> 01:10:46.198
I...

01:11:02.388 --> 01:11:03.955
Have you asked him about it?

01:11:03.955 --> 01:11:04.956
No.

01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:08.002
I can't find the words.

01:11:14.661 --> 01:11:16.141
So, what are you going to do?

01:11:23.627 --> 01:11:25.585
I don't know what
the right thing to do is.

01:11:27.457 --> 01:11:29.328
I don't know if I could do it, anyways.

01:11:38.598 --> 01:11:40.600
<i>I know.
I feel guilty too.</i>

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.646
<i>I've got to leave,
but I don't think</i>

01:11:42.646 --> 01:11:44.865
<i>that's what you should be
thinking about right now, Mom.</i>

01:11:44.865 --> 01:11:47.912
<i>He was responsible for bringing
fentanyl into the South End.</i>

01:11:47.912 --> 01:11:51.568
<i>Come on.
Pick up the phone... Come on.</i>

01:11:51.568 --> 01:11:53.613
<i>Ducky's not
getting away with this shit.</i>

01:11:54.397 --> 01:11:57.269
<i>We think he and Michael might
have been in business together.</i>

01:11:57.835 --> 01:12:00.359
<i>Maybe there was a dispute
or something.</i>

01:12:00.359 --> 01:12:02.579
<i>I can't expect you
to pick up this time.</i>

01:12:03.275 --> 01:12:05.495
<i>There is something I want
to tell you in person.</i>

01:12:06.409 --> 01:12:08.149
<i>Okay, Mom...</i>

01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:10.413
<i>Listen, you've got
to be careful with that girl.</i>

01:12:10.413 --> 01:12:11.979
<i>...I love you
so much.</i>

01:12:11.979 --> 01:12:13.677
<i>Bye.</i>

01:12:13.677 --> 01:12:15.200
<i>You know
who called him, Paige.</i>

01:12:15.896 --> 01:12:17.507
<i>It was Ducky.</i>

01:12:17.507 --> 01:12:19.465
<i>We checked his phone.</i>

01:12:50.931 --> 01:12:52.150
Hi.

01:12:52.803 --> 01:12:54.021
She's sleeping.

01:12:56.633 --> 01:12:58.025
You feeling okay, Mom?

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:03.161
No. Not really.

01:13:06.686 --> 01:13:07.905
Wow.

01:13:07.905 --> 01:13:10.124
Haven't seen this thing
in years.

01:13:11.778 --> 01:13:14.433
This was dad's nicest suitcase.

01:13:15.826 --> 01:13:18.306
They covered it
in fucking stickers.

01:13:23.616 --> 01:13:25.183
The stuff's in there.

01:13:32.495 --> 01:13:34.410
You think that's
what killed her?

01:13:41.852 --> 01:13:43.419
Yeah, it seems like it.

01:13:47.727 --> 01:13:49.686
They both had fentanyl in them.

01:13:54.038 --> 01:13:55.343
Seriously, Mom.

01:13:55.866 --> 01:13:57.433
You should go see a doctor.

01:14:00.914 --> 01:14:02.742
Yeah... I will.

01:14:05.789 --> 01:14:07.617
Okay, I tried.

01:14:21.282 --> 01:14:22.370
Okay.

01:17:29.993 --> 01:17:32.517
Thank you.
I told you.

01:17:51.841 --> 01:17:53.407
<i>The Empire
Line running express</i>

01:17:53.407 --> 01:17:56.628
<i>to Penn Station, New York City,
which stops in Hudson,</i>

01:17:56.628 --> 01:17:59.587
<i>Rhinecliff, Poughkeepsie,
Croton and Yonkers</i>

01:17:59.587 --> 01:18:02.939
<i>with a final stop

01:18:04.331 --> 01:18:05.681
<i>Please have your tickets ready</i>

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:07.770
<i>for the conductor
when he comes through.</i>

01:20:56.895 --> 01:21:00.203
Remember when Mike threw
that perfect game...

01:21:01.595 --> 01:21:03.162
...until the final inning...

01:21:04.294 --> 01:21:06.078
...and then he gave it up
to them?

01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:13.738
That was just his luck.

01:21:16.828 --> 01:21:18.874
I didn't mean for any of this
to happen.

01:21:21.398 --> 01:21:23.269
It was supposed to be simple.

01:21:25.489 --> 01:21:28.231
When Mike found out
what was in it,

01:21:28.231 --> 01:21:30.320
he wouldn't sell it
or give it back.

01:21:31.277 --> 01:21:33.279
What did he think
they were going to do?

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:36.239
I guess that's my luck.

01:21:37.457 --> 01:21:39.982
This doesn't have anything
to do with luck.

01:21:41.592 --> 01:21:43.289
I'm scared, Mom.

01:21:50.993 --> 01:21:52.081
Me too.

01:22:49.703 --> 01:22:52.402
<i>My youngest son was born
to be an athlete.</i>

01:22:52.402 --> 01:22:55.187
<i>His older brother, Toby,
started hitting ground balls</i>

01:22:55.187 --> 01:22:56.667
<i>when he was two or three.</i>

01:22:56.667 --> 01:22:59.148
<i>The kid was good.
So was Toby.</i>

01:22:59.148 --> 01:23:01.367
<i>But Michael had something different...</i>

01:23:01.367 --> 01:23:02.803
<i>he had an arm.</i>

01:23:02.803 --> 01:23:04.327
Oh, just water for me.

01:23:05.197 --> 01:23:08.026
<i>He threw 70 miles per hour
by 14.</i>

01:23:08.026 --> 01:23:10.768
<i>The scouts started telling us
he had a real shot.</i>

01:23:11.769 --> 01:23:14.032
<i>We had no idea what kind
of damage he was doing</i>

01:23:14.032 --> 01:23:15.816
<i>to the shoulder
of his throwing arm.</i>

01:23:16.817 --> 01:23:20.734
<i>Maybe we should have
made him stop, but by 15,</i>

01:23:20.734 --> 01:23:22.954
<i>he was being medicated
for pain management.</i>

01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:27.089
<i>To say I didn't know any better
wouldn't be totally true...</i>

01:23:27.089 --> 01:23:28.699
Thanks.

01:23:28.699 --> 01:23:31.180
<i>...but I knew a kid shouldn't
be in that much pain.</i>

01:23:34.052 --> 01:23:36.402
<i>Then, I started seeing
his behaviour changing.</i>

01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:40.711
<i>Toby was a different story.</i>

01:23:40.711 --> 01:23:42.974
<i>He was the one we didn't have
to worry about...</i>

01:23:44.062 --> 01:23:46.412
<i>...the civil servant,
the ambitious one.</i>

01:23:47.370 --> 01:23:50.373
<i>That might be the only thing
I still recognize in him,</i>

01:23:50.373 --> 01:23:52.679
<i>that toxic ambition.</i>

01:23:54.681 --> 01:23:56.988
<i>As different as Mike
and Toby were,</i>

01:23:56.988 --> 01:23:58.555
<i>their lives stayed intertwined</i>

01:23:58.555 --> 01:24:00.470
<i>more than they could
ever let me know.</i>

01:24:11.655 --> 01:24:14.223
I assume you know
the implications of this.

01:24:17.487 --> 01:24:19.315
I know more than anyone.

01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:23.493
Take a couple of days...

01:24:24.146 --> 01:24:26.061
...a week, whatever.

01:24:29.586 --> 01:24:33.894
Take that time and if then,

01:24:33.894 --> 01:24:38.421
you still want to publish it,
I'll have your back.

01:24:54.741 --> 01:24:56.047
It's good.

01:25:28.427 --> 01:25:30.168
Thanks for letting us
have her for the day.

01:25:31.082 --> 01:25:32.257
Can I take her?

01:25:34.651 --> 01:25:36.479
Hello, baby!

01:25:37.175 --> 01:25:39.134
Hello, baby!

01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:42.180
Are we going to have
some fun today?

01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.921
Oh, yeah.

01:25:43.921 --> 01:25:45.618
Thanks, Mom.
See you later.

01:25:46.184 --> 01:25:47.490
Oh!

01:25:51.407 --> 01:25:52.799
Let's do it!

01:25:52.799 --> 01:25:54.149
Let's go have fun.
