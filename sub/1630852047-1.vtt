WEBVTT

00:08.551 --> 00:10.302
- [voices whispering]
- Many, many years ago,

00:10.386 --> 00:12.555
men who were born
with great power believed

00:12.638 --> 00:15.224
they could cage
Darkness itself.

00:16.267 --> 00:17.518
The arrogance.

00:20.104 --> 00:22.356
When they failed,
the seas boiled,

00:22.440 --> 00:24.024
mountains were swallowed up,

00:24.066 --> 00:25.943
cities burned,

00:26.026 --> 00:30.573
and the women of the Aes Sedai
were left to pick up the pieces.

00:30.656 --> 00:34.201
These women remembered one thing
above all else...

00:34.285 --> 00:37.121
the man who brought
the Breaking of the World.

00:37.204 --> 00:41.667
And him they named Dragon.

00:41.792 --> 00:44.336
Now, this man has been
born again.

00:44.420 --> 00:46.464
We don't know where
or to whom.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.257
If he was reborn as a girl
or a boy.

00:48.340 --> 00:51.260
The only thing we know
for certain is that

00:51.343 --> 00:54.305
this child is coming of age now,

00:54.388 --> 00:57.183
and we must find them...

00:57.266 --> 00:59.560
before the Dark does.

01:00.853 --> 01:02.855
[birds chirping]

01:10.654 --> 01:12.490
[panting]

01:12.573 --> 01:14.575
Hurry up!

01:14.658 --> 01:16.243
- [grunts]
- [panting]

01:20.956 --> 01:22.958
[panting]

01:24.084 --> 01:26.086
- [neighing]
- [woman] Hyah! Hyah!

01:31.717 --> 01:33.552
Hyah!

01:38.307 --> 01:39.308
Stop!

01:44.438 --> 01:45.856
I said stop!

01:45.940 --> 01:47.942
[rumbling]

01:49.151 --> 01:51.737
- [shouts]
- [grunting]

01:55.324 --> 01:57.159
[men panting]

01:58.911 --> 02:00.788
We can't die like this.

02:00.871 --> 02:03.374
You can fight them.
Use it.

02:04.375 --> 02:06.377
[groaning]

02:08.754 --> 02:10.798
Don't hurt him.

02:10.881 --> 02:11.924
It's not his fault.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.635
Who are you talking about?

02:14.718 --> 02:16.095
There's one else here.

02:24.186 --> 02:26.856
The madness already has him.

02:26.939 --> 02:30.401
[breathing shakily]

02:35.322 --> 02:38.325
You see,
what we've come here do...

02:38.409 --> 02:39.410
it's a gift.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.161
[whimpers]

02:41.245 --> 02:43.330
You should thank me, really.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.293
This Power...

02:47.376 --> 02:49.211
it's meant for women...

02:50.963 --> 02:52.423
...and women alone.

02:53.966 --> 02:55.759
And when you touch it...

02:57.887 --> 02:59.388
...you make it filthy.

02:59.471 --> 03:02.975
Please. No.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.727
- Please.
- Sisters.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.021
[man] Please, no. No!

03:07.104 --> 03:08.272
Please!

03:09.023 --> 03:11.108
[screaming]

03:13.110 --> 03:15.112
[echoing screams]

03:21.035 --> 03:22.703
It's not him.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.706
[screaming stops]

03:25.789 --> 03:28.167
He was born 20 years ago,

03:28.250 --> 03:31.795
almost to the day the prophecy
of the Dragon Reborn predicted.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.797
He's able to touch the Source.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.341
- It's not him.
- [sighs]

03:38.594 --> 03:39.929
Where next?

03:40.012 --> 03:41.680
The Two Rivers.

03:44.892 --> 03:48.228
There are rumors
of four ta'veren there,

03:48.312 --> 03:49.438
all the right age.

03:52.107 --> 03:55.611
The Old Blood runs deep
in those mountains.

03:55.694 --> 03:58.280
Let's hope it's prepared them
for what's coming.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.943
- [laughter]
- [birds singing]

04:39.446 --> 04:41.448
[water flowing]

04:53.836 --> 04:57.715
This braid will remind you
that you are a part of us

04:57.798 --> 05:00.259
and we a part of you.

05:01.260 --> 05:04.930
To be a woman is to be
always alone and never alone.

05:05.014 --> 05:09.935
So when the Dark surrounds you
and you see no Light,

05:10.019 --> 05:14.064
feel this braid and know
that we all stood before you.

05:15.149 --> 05:16.817
We all stand with you.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.616
As Wisdom of the Two Rivers,

05:24.700 --> 05:26.076
it's my honor to welcome you

05:26.160 --> 05:28.579
to the Women's Circle.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.420
Be strong, Egwene.

05:37.463 --> 05:39.298
Trust the river.

05:40.132 --> 05:42.051
[gasps and screams]

05:47.014 --> 05:49.641
[yelping]

05:56.899 --> 05:59.860
[gasping]

06:02.780 --> 06:05.407
[yelping]

06:10.496 --> 06:12.706
[panting]

06:16.752 --> 06:18.295
[exhales]

06:33.310 --> 06:35.312
[coughing]

06:37.064 --> 06:39.066
[panting]

06:48.408 --> 06:50.410
[panting slowly]

06:57.751 --> 07:00.420
[Tam] I remember when this road
was just a little deer path,

07:00.504 --> 07:02.589
winding down the mountain.

07:02.673 --> 07:04.550
How'd you get the wool
to town?

07:04.633 --> 07:05.551
Carried it.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.094
- And the brandy?
- [chuckles]

07:07.177 --> 07:09.429
That stayed home.

07:09.513 --> 07:12.432
- Your mother could drink.
- [laughs softly]

07:14.143 --> 07:16.395
[distant howl]

07:18.272 --> 07:19.815
[Rand] More wolves now.

07:21.733 --> 07:24.236
Something's been pushing them
down from the mountain.

07:29.658 --> 07:30.951
When you were just tiny,

07:31.034 --> 07:32.411
we'd let you out
in these woods alone

07:32.494 --> 07:33.996
to look for berries.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.831
You'd always save
a basket of them

07:35.914 --> 07:37.666
in the barn
to take to Egwene.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.544
[sighs]

07:40.627 --> 07:42.754
Sounds like I used to be
a real sap.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.506
[chuckling]

07:44.548 --> 07:45.799
[chuckles]

07:52.639 --> 07:54.641
[children shouting playfully]

07:56.643 --> 07:58.645
[dogs barking]

07:59.855 --> 08:01.857
[lively chatter]

08:04.735 --> 08:07.446
[laughter]

08:11.074 --> 08:12.576
[grunts]

08:14.328 --> 08:17.664
- [cheering]
- [laughter]

08:17.748 --> 08:19.166
The Coplins and Congars
were worried

08:19.249 --> 08:21.460
we might be without apple brandy
this Bel Tine.

08:21.543 --> 08:24.046
Wouldn't want them to remember
a minute of it.

08:24.129 --> 08:25.797
[laughter]

08:29.259 --> 08:31.887
[Mat] Right.
Gentlemen, and lady,

08:31.970 --> 08:33.889
I want to thank you all
very much

08:33.972 --> 08:35.474
for bearing with me tonight.

08:35.557 --> 08:38.143
Can't imagine it's been easy
to part with all your money,

08:38.227 --> 08:39.228
but...

08:42.773 --> 08:43.815
[others groaning]

08:47.110 --> 08:49.446
- You'll get 'em next time, Mat.
- Next time?

08:49.529 --> 08:52.157
How about right now?
Eh? Anyone?

08:52.241 --> 08:54.034
You don't have anything left
to bet.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.620
Come on. Sit down.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.288
How are you?

08:58.372 --> 08:59.873
- How're the girls?
- You can spot me.

09:01.250 --> 09:04.503
One game, three of us.
Old time's sake, eh?

09:04.586 --> 09:06.296
- Come on. We're talking.
- About what?

09:06.380 --> 09:08.799
- You're married,
your life's over.
- [chuckles]

09:08.882 --> 09:12.010
And Rand's pining over Egwene,
cold in the mountains,

09:12.094 --> 09:13.387
only the sheep to keep him warm.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.430
- Did you hear already?
- Hear what?

09:15.514 --> 09:18.976
A few folks went down to Taren
Ferry with the wool last week.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.104
Town was full of soldiers
and mercenaries headed south.

09:22.187 --> 09:25.857
- Why?
- They said there's a war
in Ghealdan.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.818
[Mat] In Ghealdan? Who cares?

09:27.901 --> 09:30.195
It was Callie Coplin told you
that, wasn't it?

09:30.279 --> 09:32.572
- So?
- She'd piss in your mouth
and tell you it was raining.

09:32.656 --> 09:34.741
[all chuckling]

09:34.825 --> 09:36.743
So, come on.

09:36.827 --> 09:37.786
- Let's play.

09:37.869 --> 09:38.787
- No?
- [laughs] No.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.539
No?

09:40.622 --> 09:42.457
Okay, fine.

09:42.541 --> 09:43.834
Enough of you guys.

09:46.461 --> 09:47.796
Danya.

09:50.966 --> 09:52.843
How much money did he lose
today?

09:52.926 --> 09:56.305
- I lost count,
but it was more than enough.
- [clapping]

09:56.346 --> 09:59.016
[cheering]

10:08.900 --> 10:10.360
My girl.

10:10.444 --> 10:11.778
You're back.

10:11.862 --> 10:14.031
I was worried that...

10:18.201 --> 10:19.953
Come on, then.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.039
- We're losing a coin
for every empty hand here.
- No.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.416
- You drink with us tonight.
- [laughs]

10:24.499 --> 10:26.752
Marin!
A drink for your daughter!

10:26.835 --> 10:28.670
[laughing]

10:28.754 --> 10:30.672
- Cheers, everybody.
- Hey.
- [whoops]

10:30.756 --> 10:32.758
- [laughter]
- Cheers!

10:38.096 --> 10:39.848
[thunder rumbling]

10:44.936 --> 10:47.147
- [lively chatter]
- [woman laughing]

10:48.482 --> 10:50.942
[laughter]

11:07.084 --> 11:08.668
How did her ceremony go today?

11:08.752 --> 11:10.504
I don't know, actually.
We, uh...

11:10.587 --> 11:12.381
We haven't talked yet.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.342
- I'm sure she's just busy.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.010
I'm sure.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.517
- [chatter quiets]
- [wind whistling]

11:37.239 --> 11:39.116
Name yourself, stranger.

11:43.412 --> 11:45.247
Lan Mandragoran.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.250
This is Moiraine.

11:59.928 --> 12:02.597
[Marin] Milady, can I help you?

12:03.598 --> 12:05.225
[thunder rumbling]

12:07.144 --> 12:08.478
We'll need stables
for our horses

12:08.562 --> 12:09.938
and a room for the night.

12:10.021 --> 12:12.691
Two beds and fresh linen.
That's all we need.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.776
Of course, Moiraine Sedai.

12:14.860 --> 12:17.737
[murmuring]

12:23.994 --> 12:25.996
[murmuring dies down]

12:40.218 --> 12:41.845
If you'll come this way.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.513
[quiet chatter resumes]

12:46.183 --> 12:47.517
[scoffs]

12:47.601 --> 12:49.352
She looks like a normal person.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.062
- I don't know, I...
- Quiet.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.523
Who knows what she can hear?

12:53.607 --> 12:56.651
Maybe she's headed
to the war in the south?

12:56.735 --> 12:58.111
In the stories,

12:58.195 --> 13:02.032
they say one Aes Sedai can turn
a battle on her own.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.825
[Nynaeve] I don't care
where she's going to,

13:03.909 --> 13:06.244
but we'll all be happier
and safer when she's there.

13:08.079 --> 13:09.080
Where's Laila?

13:10.415 --> 13:12.042
Probably at the forge.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.128
Iron's hard to work alone.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.924
[laughter
and indistinct chatter]

13:19.966 --> 13:20.967
Give Egwene my best.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.063
[grunts]

13:33.146 --> 13:34.898
[Perrin] What are you doing
in here?

13:34.981 --> 13:36.983
Everyone is at the inn.

13:42.239 --> 13:45.617
They said you didn't even go
to her ceremony.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.662
[sighs]

13:51.665 --> 13:53.583
I love you.

13:58.547 --> 14:00.048
I know.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.516
- [lively chatter in distance]
- [glass breaks]

14:12.227 --> 14:15.063
Mum?
Mum, what are you doing here?

14:16.106 --> 14:18.275
Same thing as anyone else.

14:18.358 --> 14:21.027
- Where's Dad?
- Huh.

14:22.612 --> 14:25.323
Right where the whole town
could see him.

14:25.407 --> 14:28.410
- The prick.
- Who's with the girls?

14:28.493 --> 14:29.703
That pig!

14:29.786 --> 14:32.163
Come on.
Time to go home, Mum.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.499
- I will go wherever I want.
- Please.

14:34.583 --> 14:36.167
- [quiet chatter]
- How are you?

14:38.128 --> 14:39.754
[grunts]

14:39.838 --> 14:42.507
Matty, is Mum sick again?

14:42.591 --> 14:45.510
- I'm fine, you little bi...
- [Mat] She's all right.

14:45.594 --> 14:47.095
- [groans]
- Don't worry.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.098
[sighs]

14:52.392 --> 14:55.312
You're going to be
just like your dad.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.564
I know it.

14:59.024 --> 15:01.484
Damn prick like him.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.529
[sobbing softly]

15:08.700 --> 15:10.327
Hey.

15:11.369 --> 15:13.830
How about you two sleep with me
tonight, instead of Mum and Dad?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.248
Yeah?

15:15.332 --> 15:18.335
Cheers. Come on, then.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.594
[distant chatter]

15:28.970 --> 15:30.930
[Marin] A thousand wars
have washed over

15:31.014 --> 15:32.223
the lands down-mountain,

15:32.307 --> 15:34.392
and Two Rivers folk don't have
any more need

15:34.476 --> 15:36.645
to pay attention now
than before.

15:36.728 --> 15:40.231
War is just fools killing
other fools for foolish causes.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.484
Aes Sedai don't fight wars.

15:42.567 --> 15:45.654
They pull the strings of the
world from their White Tower.

15:45.737 --> 15:47.197
And if one of them's here...

15:47.280 --> 15:49.741
Then she'll enjoy Bel Tine
tomorrow like the rest of us.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.203
- [departing footsteps]
- [dishes rattling]

15:53.286 --> 15:57.123
Rand, Egwene, why don't you two
finish up the dishes?

15:57.207 --> 15:58.541
Of course.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.467
You've been avoiding me.

16:08.510 --> 16:11.304
Or biding my time
until I could get you alone?

16:21.439 --> 16:22.399
How'd it go today?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.734
- [scoffs]
- [water splashing]

16:24.818 --> 16:26.820
- You know I can't talk about...
- It's me.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.530
You can at least say
if it was good or bad.

16:33.118 --> 16:34.661
It was...

16:37.706 --> 16:38.957
...good.

16:40.959 --> 16:42.836
[chuckles softly]

16:49.050 --> 16:50.635
I'm sorry, it's just...

16:50.719 --> 16:53.638
I'm thinking about something
that Nynaeve...

17:06.359 --> 17:07.736
You know...

17:08.778 --> 17:12.282
...my dad said I used
to pick baskets of berries

17:12.365 --> 17:14.993
to bring to you
when I was a kid.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.579
- Like some lovesick puppy.
- [chuckles]

17:17.662 --> 17:20.498
Mm. Sounds sweet to me.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.712
[Egwene chuckles softly]

17:30.258 --> 17:31.426
[gasps]

17:32.427 --> 17:34.763
Has that been in your pocket
all day?

17:35.972 --> 17:38.391
- Maybe.
- [chuckles softly]

17:38.475 --> 17:39.976
Come here.

17:46.608 --> 17:48.610
[fire crackling]

18:03.833 --> 18:05.543
[sighs]

18:07.962 --> 18:09.005
It could be warmer.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.257
I'm impressed
they have this at all.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.718
It could be warmer.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.576
Better?

18:38.660 --> 18:40.745
Much.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.997
[chuckles softly]

18:43.081 --> 18:45.542
[sighs]

18:52.257 --> 18:53.466
What is it?

18:56.511 --> 18:58.638
You think it's one of them?

19:00.306 --> 19:01.975
Which one?

19:05.687 --> 19:07.146
[door closes]

19:14.779 --> 19:16.781
You let me fall asleep.

19:19.367 --> 19:22.245
You act as if I had some say
in the matter.

19:24.706 --> 19:26.749
What happened out there today?

19:29.127 --> 19:31.504
It wasn't today.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.214
It was before.

19:34.257 --> 19:36.259
Nynaeve.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.344
She asked me to become
her apprentice,

19:38.386 --> 19:41.472
to study to be a Wisdom someday.

19:41.556 --> 19:42.932
What?

19:43.016 --> 19:43.933
No, you...

19:44.017 --> 19:44.934
She asked.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.103
I didn't say yes or no.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.773
Really?

19:52.775 --> 19:54.736
She thinks I'll be able
to listen to the wind

19:54.819 --> 19:56.654
if I work with her.

20:00.909 --> 20:04.954
It's a lonely life,
being a Wisdom.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.707
No husband.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.585
No kids.

20:16.674 --> 20:19.052
I should get up to bed.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.721
Rand.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.395
[wind whistling]

20:42.492 --> 20:45.244
[distorted whistling]

20:58.841 --> 21:02.637
[whistling]

21:04.472 --> 21:06.474
- [goats bleating]
- [children chattering]

21:08.309 --> 21:11.270
[Padan] Merry Bel Tine!
Merry Bel Tine!

21:11.354 --> 21:13.731
- [laughing]
- [excited chatter]

21:13.815 --> 21:16.067
No. No sweet sticks for you.

21:16.150 --> 21:17.527
[laughing]

21:19.570 --> 21:21.614
- Too early for breakfast?
- [chuckles softly]

21:21.698 --> 21:23.449
Never too early
for your mum's bread.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.368
- [dog barks]
- [goat bleats]

21:26.411 --> 21:27.870
He left before I woke.

21:37.046 --> 21:39.048
[lively chatter in distance]

21:45.221 --> 21:48.599
[chuckles] Mat Cauthon.

21:48.683 --> 21:51.811
My best and poorest customer.

21:51.894 --> 21:53.479
Seems like I'm
your only customer.

21:58.359 --> 22:01.446
So, what do you have for me
this year?

22:07.827 --> 22:09.579
Oh. Oh, dear.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.164
Not real gold, sadly.

22:11.247 --> 22:12.665
Yes, it is.

22:12.749 --> 22:13.958
It's worth three marks,
at least.

22:14.042 --> 22:15.835
Mm. Possibly.

22:15.918 --> 22:18.713
But will I be able to sell it
here in town?

22:20.173 --> 22:21.215
[scoffs]

22:21.299 --> 22:22.842
I'll give you one mark.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.677
- Two.
- Half a mark.

22:24.761 --> 22:26.637
That will get you
three lanterns,

22:26.721 --> 22:28.514
and you'll be lucky
to have 'em.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.477
You're a right bastard,
Padan Fain.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.187
Pleasure as always.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.869
You didn't sleep last night.

22:49.952 --> 22:53.289
You think one of the Eyeless
is already here?

22:57.126 --> 22:59.670
Then we both have work
to do today.

23:00.671 --> 23:02.673
[hawk calling]

23:05.093 --> 23:07.095
[birds singing]

23:13.059 --> 23:15.394
Thought you might be here.

23:15.478 --> 23:16.896
[Rand chuckles softly]

23:22.819 --> 23:25.446
When I come up here...

23:25.530 --> 23:27.573
you know what I wonder about?

23:30.535 --> 23:33.246
I wonder about my life here.

23:35.248 --> 23:37.125
In the Two Rivers.

23:39.627 --> 23:42.004
About the house I'll build.

23:45.800 --> 23:48.386
The wife I'll have.

23:51.848 --> 23:55.726
About my kids running through
these woods, just like I did.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.364
[inhales deeply]

24:08.447 --> 24:11.117
- I'm going to...
- I know.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.537
I already know.

24:22.170 --> 24:23.921
[sniffles]

24:24.005 --> 24:25.673
[sobbing]

24:31.637 --> 24:33.639
[insects trilling]

24:47.278 --> 24:49.739
[Moiraine] They call you
a leader in this town, Wisdom,

24:49.822 --> 24:51.449
and here you are, cleaning.

24:51.532 --> 24:53.743
This pool is sacred.
It's an honor to clean it.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.244
What are you doing here?

24:55.328 --> 24:57.288
I wanted to walk.

24:57.371 --> 24:58.539
In the Two Rivers.

24:58.623 --> 25:00.625
I could ask the same of you.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.419
You're not from here,
are you?

25:05.838 --> 25:09.926
The old Wisdom brought you here
when you were a baby...

25:10.009 --> 25:12.220
a baby whose parents passed.

25:13.888 --> 25:16.807
But no one can remember
exactly when.

25:16.891 --> 25:18.142
That's the thing
about these little towns,

25:18.226 --> 25:20.228
no one keeps records
of anything.

25:20.311 --> 25:22.021
Births, deaths...

25:22.104 --> 25:23.940
It doesn't mean
we don't remember.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.035
[Nynaeve] That old Wisdom...

25:36.118 --> 25:39.497
the woman who raised me...

25:39.580 --> 25:41.374
When she was only 13,

25:41.457 --> 25:43.334
she realized she could
listen to the wind,

25:43.417 --> 25:45.586
and she went to the White Tower.

25:47.129 --> 25:49.006
She walked.

25:51.175 --> 25:52.718
From here.

25:54.845 --> 25:56.555
It took her months.

26:00.101 --> 26:02.436
And when she got there,
your sisters took one look

26:02.520 --> 26:04.355
at her ragged clothes,

26:04.438 --> 26:08.317
her peasant accent,
and they turned her away.

26:11.279 --> 26:13.864
She was small
and from a little town,

26:13.948 --> 26:16.325
but she remembered.

26:16.409 --> 26:18.703
Until the day she died.

26:18.786 --> 26:20.204
So do I.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.749
See, people say you're too young
to be the Wisdom,

26:23.833 --> 26:25.626
and I disagree.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.546
I think you're strong,

26:28.629 --> 26:30.756
even if you have only had
that braid for, what...

26:30.840 --> 26:32.383
what, a year or two?

26:33.426 --> 26:34.593
I've had it for five.

26:34.677 --> 26:38.639
So that makes you 25... 26.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.727
That doesn't mean
I can't do my job.

26:42.810 --> 26:46.856
And whatever you may think,
that is to protect this town.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.233
From you, if I have to.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.154
Enjoy your walk.

27:00.745 --> 27:02.663
[indistinct chatter]

27:02.747 --> 27:04.373
Cheers, boys.

27:04.457 --> 27:06.959
Made it through another year
of this shite.

27:08.586 --> 27:09.879
[Perrin chuckles]

27:11.922 --> 27:14.175
All right. Out with it.

27:14.258 --> 27:15.384
Out with what?

27:15.468 --> 27:17.845
- Nothing.
- [Mat] Bollocks.

27:17.928 --> 27:19.597
Something happened with Egwene.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.682
What happened?

27:24.393 --> 27:26.270
That bad, was it?

27:26.354 --> 27:28.356
[sighs]

27:30.566 --> 27:32.276
[water rushing]

27:32.360 --> 27:35.237
[wind blowing]

27:35.321 --> 27:36.906
[exhales]

27:46.082 --> 27:47.833
Do you hear that?

27:47.917 --> 27:49.877
[wind whistling]

27:53.172 --> 27:55.132
[wind intensifies]

28:04.350 --> 28:06.352
[ominous whispering voices]

28:08.187 --> 28:10.314
[Egwene] It sounds...

28:10.398 --> 28:11.899
wrong.

28:14.151 --> 28:16.070
What does it mean?

28:17.780 --> 28:19.407
I don't know.

28:20.908 --> 28:23.452
I've never heard anything
like it.

28:24.453 --> 28:26.747
- [wind howling]
- [ominous whispering voices]

28:57.111 --> 28:59.113
- [chatter, laughter]
- [goat bleating]

29:04.702 --> 29:06.287
[Perrin] Mat, we noticed

29:06.370 --> 29:07.705
your luck wasn't really with you

29:07.788 --> 29:09.290
last night.

29:09.373 --> 29:11.792
So Rand and I chipped in.

29:12.877 --> 29:15.212
To buy some lanterns
for the girls.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.508
We'll be all right.

29:25.681 --> 29:27.057
Thank you.

29:27.141 --> 29:28.142
[Rand] All right.
I should get home.

29:30.186 --> 29:32.313
Don't stay up-mountain too long.

29:32.396 --> 29:33.856
I won't.

29:40.362 --> 29:42.823
[wind whistling]

29:46.410 --> 29:48.412
[cart rattling]

29:52.833 --> 29:54.627
[bleating]

30:03.469 --> 30:04.803
[Rand] Maybe we should be
at Bel Tine.

30:04.887 --> 30:07.473
To light a candle for her.

30:07.556 --> 30:11.143
Whole point is to help guide
her spirit back to us.

30:11.227 --> 30:14.438
Doesn't matter where we are
when we do it, really.

30:23.322 --> 30:26.617
How long does it take
before the Wheel of Time

30:26.700 --> 30:29.286
turns someone's spirit back
into the world again?

30:29.370 --> 30:30.913
[Tam] Wish I knew.

30:30.996 --> 30:33.207
But I'm sure there's a reason
no one can remember

30:33.290 --> 30:35.209
their previous lives.

30:35.292 --> 30:37.545
All we can do is the best we can

30:37.628 --> 30:40.256
with the life
that's given to us.

30:43.133 --> 30:45.594
And take comfort from it.

30:46.637 --> 30:48.514
That no matter what happens,
what...

30:49.557 --> 30:51.141
...pain we face...

30:52.601 --> 30:54.103
...what heartbreak...

30:55.437 --> 30:57.481
...even death...

30:59.483 --> 31:01.819
...the Wheel keeps turning.

31:03.654 --> 31:05.239
Always.

31:07.241 --> 31:09.577
And we try again.

31:09.660 --> 31:12.663
Maybe do a little better
than the last time.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.540
[chuckles softly]

31:48.282 --> 31:50.534
[sniffles]

31:50.576 --> 31:52.286
[clears throat]

31:59.877 --> 32:01.962
[water flowing]

32:03.005 --> 32:04.798
[twig snaps]

32:09.928 --> 32:11.388
[gasps softly]

32:19.772 --> 32:21.065
[indistinct chatter]

32:21.148 --> 32:22.691
[Marin] Come on, now.

32:22.775 --> 32:25.527
If we want our loved ones' souls
to make their way back here,

32:25.611 --> 32:29.198
we'd best show them
something worth coming back for.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.283
- [upbeat music playing]
- [cheering]

32:43.379 --> 32:46.006
Come on. [laughs]

32:48.550 --> 32:49.677
[laughs]

33:05.818 --> 33:07.403
[Lan] The Fade
has Trollocs with it.

33:08.445 --> 33:09.822
Dozens.

33:09.905 --> 33:11.949
We need to leave. Now.

33:16.036 --> 33:18.956
Do you know
which one of them it is?

33:19.039 --> 33:20.749
No.

33:23.544 --> 33:25.462
- [cheering]

33:45.023 --> 33:46.108
- [grunts]
- Tom?

33:46.191 --> 33:48.736
Tom, what's wro...

33:55.367 --> 33:56.493
[gasps]

33:56.577 --> 33:58.370
- [roaring]
- [screaming]

33:58.454 --> 34:00.831
[screams]

34:06.545 --> 34:08.672
[indistinct screaming]

34:08.756 --> 34:09.840
[Egwene whimpers]

34:09.923 --> 34:11.508
[grunts]

34:14.261 --> 34:16.180
- [indistinct shouting]
- [Egwene yelps]

34:19.433 --> 34:21.477
[screaming]

34:28.984 --> 34:29.902
Aah!

34:29.985 --> 34:31.987
[whimpering]

34:33.113 --> 34:34.448
- Get down.
- [grunts]

34:34.531 --> 34:37.993
- [both panting]
- Nynaeve, what's happening?

34:38.076 --> 34:39.620
What are they?

34:39.661 --> 34:41.622
- [roaring]
- [screaming]

34:48.045 --> 34:49.338
[indistinct chatter]

34:49.421 --> 34:51.298
Quick, quick!

34:51.381 --> 34:52.841
[Perrin] [grunts]
Who are they?

34:52.925 --> 34:54.927
[screaming continues]

35:05.020 --> 35:06.396
[panting, grunts]

35:06.480 --> 35:09.149
Mum. Dad.

35:09.233 --> 35:11.819
- Where are the girls?
- They... they were right here.

35:11.902 --> 35:13.028
- I...
- Where are the girls?!

35:13.111 --> 35:14.363
[screams]

35:16.532 --> 35:19.201
[screaming continues]

35:19.284 --> 35:20.619
Help me! Help me!

35:21.912 --> 35:23.372
[screams]

35:35.843 --> 35:38.428
[grunting]

Dad. Are you all right?

37:51.937 --> 37:53.689
[panting]
I'm fine.

37:53.772 --> 37:56.400
It's a Trolloc.
You need to get out of here.

37:56.483 --> 37:58.485
[gasping]

38:00.445 --> 38:03.532
You need to leave.

38:05.742 --> 38:07.619
- Go.
- No.

It's all right. I've got you.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.966
I've got you. I've got you.

40:26.049 --> 40:27.592
Don't worry. All right?

40:27.676 --> 40:29.094
Remember when we played
hide-and-seek?

40:29.177 --> 40:30.095
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

40:30.178 --> 40:31.429
Big oak in the woods.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.043

Egwene.

[exhales]

45:58.673 --> 46:01.259
Thank the Light.

46:02.844 --> 46:04.471
My dad.

46:04.554 --> 46:06.723
He needs help. Where...

46:06.806 --> 46:08.975
Where's Nynaeve?

46:11.019 --> 46:13.396
She's gone.

46:16.441 --> 46:18.359
[exhales]

46:18.443 --> 46:20.069
Can you help him?

46:23.198 --> 46:25.366
Quick.

46:44.010 --> 46:45.970
My babies.

46:46.054 --> 46:48.181
- Mum!
- My baby girls.

46:48.264 --> 46:50.183
- You're all right.
- Mummy. Mummy.

46:50.266 --> 46:53.186
Oh, thank the Light.

46:53.269 --> 46:55.438
Thank the Light.

47:04.989 --> 47:06.824
Perrin!

47:08.701 --> 47:09.786
Perrin?

47:47.073 --> 47:49.701
It's Trolloc poison.

[grunts]

48:08.511 --> 48:10.513
[Moiraine exhales shakily]

48:29.741 --> 48:31.242
You show up,

48:31.326 --> 48:33.369
then these things the next day.

48:33.453 --> 48:36.331
They're here
for the same reason as I am.

48:36.414 --> 48:37.874
For you.

48:39.417 --> 48:40.627
For the four of you.

48:42.086 --> 48:44.005
Twenty years ago,

48:44.088 --> 48:46.716
there was a woman
at the White Tower.

48:46.799 --> 48:49.927
An Aes Sedai born
with eyes so white,

48:50.011 --> 48:52.347
she couldn't see anything.

48:52.430 --> 48:55.224
Yet still she saw.

48:55.308 --> 48:57.894
Glimpses of the turning
of the Wheel.

48:57.977 --> 49:00.396
The Dark One is waking.

49:00.480 --> 49:02.065
His whispers

49:02.148 --> 49:04.108
are already in the backs
of our minds.

49:04.192 --> 49:07.654
But there will be one
who can stand against him.

49:09.280 --> 49:12.617
The Dragon has been born again.

49:12.700 --> 49:15.286
And it's one of you.

49:16.579 --> 49:18.456
You've fully lost your mind.

49:18.539 --> 49:19.999
[chuckles softly]

49:20.083 --> 49:21.542
Moiraine.

49:23.252 --> 49:24.921
[distant screeching]

49:29.676 --> 49:30.802
What are those?

49:30.885 --> 49:32.345
[Moiraine] The Dark One's army.

49:32.428 --> 49:35.014
- More Trollocs.
- Three hundred at least.

49:35.098 --> 49:36.724
How did they get here so fast?

49:36.808 --> 49:38.726
- Get the horses.
- What? You can't leave.

49:38.810 --> 49:39.852
You're coming with me.

49:39.936 --> 49:41.688
The four of you.

49:41.771 --> 49:45.525
Your life isn't going to be
what you thought.

49:45.608 --> 49:47.402
You've lived too long
in these mountains,

49:47.485 --> 49:49.654
pretending that what happens
in the rest of the world

49:49.737 --> 49:51.739
- won't affect you.
- We can't just leave.

49:51.823 --> 49:53.491
They're after you.

49:53.574 --> 49:55.076
They will follow you.

49:55.159 --> 49:57.787
And if you stay here,
this is where they'll come.

49:57.870 --> 49:59.872
They will leave nothing
and no one standing,

49:59.956 --> 50:01.374
and I can't do anything
to stop them.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.335
Our only chance

50:04.419 --> 50:06.671
is to reach the White Tower
and the other sisters

50:06.754 --> 50:08.339
of the Aes Sedai.

50:09.757 --> 50:11.509
There's no time.

50:11.592 --> 50:13.302
We leave now.

50:25.857 --> 50:28.067
[Moiraine] The Wheel of Time
turns,

50:28.151 --> 50:30.403
and Ages come and pass,

50:30.486 --> 50:33.948
leaving memories
that become legend.

50:34.949 --> 50:36.409
Legend fades to myth,

50:36.492 --> 50:38.411
and even myth is long forgotten

50:38.494 --> 50:41.330
when the Age that gave it birth
comes again.

50:59.265 --> 51:02.643
In one Age,
called the Third Age by some,

51:02.727 --> 51:05.897
a wind rose
in the Mountains of Mist.

51:07.273 --> 51:09.317
The wind was not the beginning.

51:09.400 --> 51:11.235
There are neither beginnings
nor endings

51:11.319 --> 51:13.821
to the turning
of the Wheel of Time.

51:15.698 --> 51:18.701
But it was a beginning.
