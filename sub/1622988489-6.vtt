WEBVTT

00:01.125 --> 00:02.916
MOBIUS: You weren't born to be king, Loki.

00:03.000 --> 00:06.583
You were born to cause pain
and suffering and death.

00:09.083 --> 00:10.500
RENSLAYER: The Time-Keepers are all

00:10.583 --> 00:12.625
that stand between us
and full-scale calamity.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.500
MOBIUS: For all time.
RENSLAYER: Always.

00:14.666 --> 00:16.541
Why am I locked in here?

00:16.625 --> 00:18.625
You were disloyal to the TVA.

00:18.708 --> 00:21.208
HUNTER B-15: You were in the Time-Keepers'
chambers. They weren't real.

00:21.291 --> 00:23.916
-And why does that change anything?
-That changes everything!

00:25.333 --> 00:27.000
MOBIUS: The nexus event
the two of you caused,

00:27.083 --> 00:30.000
whatever that connection is,
can bring this whole place down.

00:30.625 --> 00:33.125
This is new for me. Back on Lamentis...

00:34.833 --> 00:37.041
I can help you if you trust me.

00:40.125 --> 00:43.375
SYLVIE: The person we're after
is beyond The Void at the end of time.

00:44.125 --> 00:47.250
That thing is just their guard dog
protecting the only way in.

00:47.333 --> 00:49.583
-How do we get past the guard dog?
-I'm gonna enchant it.

00:49.666 --> 00:50.875
She's pretty confident.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.125
Go!

01:21.125 --> 01:22.250
SAM: Way to go, Tic Tac!

01:22.333 --> 01:23.583
HOPE: That's how you punch.

01:23.666 --> 01:24.833
BLACK PANTHER: Wakanda forever!

01:24.916 --> 01:26.166
ANT-MAN: You haven't heard of me.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.750
-Let me put you on hold.
-Dance-off, bro.

01:27.958 --> 01:30.041
THOR: A friend from work.
ROGERS: I can do this all day.

01:30.125 --> 01:32.041
-Yeah, I know.
-HANK: I'll show you ferocity.

01:32.125 --> 01:33.750
CAPTAIN MARVEL:
Higher, further, faster, baby.

01:33.833 --> 01:34.916
LOKI: We have a Hulk.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.791
KORG: We're gonna jump on that spaceship
and get out of here. Wanna come?

01:51.916 --> 01:54.208
MAN: We think of time
as a one-way motion.

01:54.291 --> 01:55.833
NEIL ARMSTRONG:
One small step for man...

01:55.916 --> 01:57.250
GRETA THUNBERG: How dare they!

02:03.500 --> 02:04.625
MALALA YOUSAFZAI: My dream...

02:04.708 --> 02:08.125
NELSON MANDELA: We have fought
for the right to experience peace.

02:13.666 --> 02:15.375
LOKI: Glorious purpose!

02:15.458 --> 02:17.833
WOMAN: Motivated by women
throughout the world.

02:17.916 --> 02:19.750
VISION: What is grief,
if not love persevering?

02:19.833 --> 02:20.833
MAYA ANGELOU: I will rise.

02:21.208 --> 02:22.541
SYLVIE: Open your eyes.

03:30.125 --> 03:32.541
Aren't you gonna tell me
not to kick the door in?

03:35.583 --> 03:37.083
It never made a difference.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.875
Well, if you think it's a bad idea,
I prefer you to speak your mind.

03:42.875 --> 03:45.500
No. Nothing to say.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.625
That'll be a first.

03:56.916 --> 03:57.916
Everything okay?

03:58.291 --> 04:00.250
Yeah. Just need a moment.

04:01.291 --> 04:02.291
Right.

04:04.875 --> 04:07.166
-It's just, you normally...
-Loki, shut up.

04:07.250 --> 04:09.125
I was pruned before you even existed.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.500
I have been waiting for this moment
my entire life.

04:11.583 --> 04:14.333
I just need a second
to get my head straight, okay?

04:14.416 --> 04:16.083
Sure. Of course.

04:49.208 --> 04:50.625
Hey, y'all.

04:52.833 --> 04:53.916
SYLVIE: You again?

04:54.458 --> 04:57.791
Welcome to The Citadel at the End of Time.

04:58.375 --> 04:59.375
Come on.

04:59.458 --> 05:01.208
MISS MINUTES: Congratulations.

05:01.291 --> 05:04.250
Y'all had an awfully long journey
to get here.

05:04.875 --> 05:06.791
He's impressed.

05:06.875 --> 05:08.000
Who's impressed?

05:08.750 --> 05:10.625
He Who Remains.

05:12.208 --> 05:14.000
And who is he?

05:14.083 --> 05:17.625
He created all and he controls all.

05:17.708 --> 05:22.583
At the end, it is only He Who Remains.

05:22.666 --> 05:25.583
And he wants to offer you a deal.

05:25.666 --> 05:28.583
He's been making
a few creative adjustments,

05:28.666 --> 05:33.625
and he's worked it out so we can reinsert
both of y'all back into the Timeline

05:33.708 --> 05:36.291
in a way that won't disrupt things.

05:36.375 --> 05:38.583
-"Won't disrupt things"?
-MISS MINUTES: Mmm-hmm.

05:38.666 --> 05:41.458
The TVA can keep doin' its vital work

05:41.541 --> 05:45.166
and y'all can live the lives
you've always wanted.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.375
And what have we always wanted?

05:47.458 --> 05:49.791
MISS MINUTES: Now,
don't play coy with me, mister.

05:50.875 --> 05:53.583
You know how you got into this mess.

05:53.666 --> 05:54.916
What?

05:55.000 --> 05:57.375
MISS MINUTES:
The Battle of New York, silly.

05:57.458 --> 06:01.708
You versus those self-righteous Avengers.

06:01.791 --> 06:04.750
How would you like to win?

06:05.583 --> 06:07.041
But not just there.

06:08.041 --> 06:10.125
You can kill Thanos.

06:13.375 --> 06:16.958
You want the Infinity Gauntlet? Yours.

06:18.041 --> 06:21.166
Throne of Asgard? No problem.

06:22.666 --> 06:24.583
What about you, missy?

06:24.666 --> 06:27.291
All those years on the run.

06:27.375 --> 06:30.166
Desperate, alone.

06:30.250 --> 06:36.291
How would you like to wake up tomorrow
with just a lifetime of happy memories?

06:38.291 --> 06:40.791
Two Lokis in the same place.

06:41.958 --> 06:43.333
Both of us...

06:44.833 --> 06:46.583
together on the Timeline.

06:48.208 --> 06:51.125
It's crazy, but he could make it work.

06:53.208 --> 06:54.250
All of it.

06:55.041 --> 06:56.125
Everything.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.916
Exactly the way you've always wanted.

06:59.625 --> 07:02.625
And you can have it all, together.

07:07.208 --> 07:08.583
It's fiction.

07:10.916 --> 07:13.000
We write our own destiny now.

07:13.125 --> 07:17.125
Oh, sure you do. Good luck with that.

07:23.458 --> 07:24.541
Come on.

07:39.833 --> 07:40.833
MISS MINUTES: Hey, there.

07:40.916 --> 07:42.791
-What took you so long?
-Sorry.

07:42.875 --> 07:44.625
Some things had to get worked out,

07:44.708 --> 07:47.333
but I'm downloadin'
the files you need now.

07:51.958 --> 07:53.375
This isn't what I asked for.

07:53.458 --> 07:56.083
I know, but he thinks
this'll be more useful.

07:56.875 --> 07:57.875
Who?

07:57.958 --> 07:59.250
Happy readin'.

08:10.250 --> 08:11.750
LOKI: He Who Remains.

08:12.708 --> 08:14.250
SYLVIE: Not for much longer.

08:54.541 --> 08:56.750
Are we sure he's even still alive?

09:30.625 --> 09:33.125
...same person.

09:33.208 --> 09:37.416
I mean, it's a little unnatural. But...

09:38.750 --> 09:39.958
Wow!

09:43.666 --> 09:44.875
Wild.

09:48.166 --> 09:49.583
He Who Remains.

09:49.666 --> 09:50.875
He Who Remains.

09:51.541 --> 09:53.583
She still calls me that?

09:53.666 --> 09:56.041
Creepy, right? But...

09:57.500 --> 09:58.500
I like it.

10:02.250 --> 10:06.250
Come on. Come on, let's talk in my office.

10:15.291 --> 10:17.083
Not what you were expecting, hmm?

10:19.833 --> 10:22.416
You're just... a man.

10:22.625 --> 10:23.666
Mmm.

10:23.750 --> 10:24.916
Flesh and blood.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.291
-Don't tell me I'm a disappointment.
-No.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.750
Just a little bit easier to kill.

10:52.625 --> 10:53.625
Come on in.

11:04.875 --> 11:05.875
HE WHO REMAINS: One...

11:09.250 --> 11:10.250
Two.

11:13.416 --> 11:15.708
Please, take a seat.

11:21.375 --> 11:23.375
Uh, Loki.

11:25.916 --> 11:27.041
Loki.

11:29.500 --> 11:30.708
Two sugars.

11:51.958 --> 11:54.458
-I said I wasn't to be disturbed.

11:54.541 --> 11:56.500
Well, then you're not gonna
be happy to see me.

11:58.625 --> 12:00.000
He's back.

12:03.875 --> 12:06.083
If anyone was ever gonna
make it back from The Void,

12:06.166 --> 12:07.500
I suppose it was gonna be you.

12:07.583 --> 12:11.500
Oh, well, you know, one man's Void
is another man's piece of cake.

12:16.041 --> 12:18.291
-So, you're gonna prune me?
-I like that idea.

12:18.375 --> 12:21.583
But, you know, my standards might be a
little bit higher in that area than yours.

12:21.666 --> 12:24.791
-You know, with close personal friends.
-I'm sorry, Mobius.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.083
I couldn't let you get in the way
of our mission.

12:28.166 --> 12:29.166
Mission?

12:29.250 --> 12:32.500
The Time-Keepers are fake.
We're all Variants. What mission?

12:32.583 --> 12:36.208
It can't have been for nothing.
That's why I had to prune you.

12:37.416 --> 12:39.333
Hunter D-90 to my office, immediately.

12:39.416 --> 12:42.625
Yeah. Sorry, Ravonna. That's not gonna
work out the way you think it is,

12:43.125 --> 12:45.416
now that we know your secret.

12:46.708 --> 12:47.958
What did you do?

12:51.500 --> 12:53.583
HUNTER U-92: Stay alert, she's close.

12:57.875 --> 13:01.041
Secure the perimeter. I've got her.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.083
Stand down, B-15.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.625
You need to listen to me.

13:13.708 --> 13:16.458
-HUNTER U-92: There'll be time for that.
-Just wait.

13:17.125 --> 13:19.250
What the hell is going on here?

13:20.333 --> 13:21.791
Judge Renslayer.

13:21.875 --> 13:22.916
What?

13:23.416 --> 13:26.291
Who are you? And what the hell
are you doing in my school?

13:31.208 --> 13:32.500
How?

13:32.583 --> 13:34.416
We have a lot to talk about.

13:36.791 --> 13:39.000
Been a long journey for you, hasn't it?

13:40.125 --> 13:42.375
Lot of running, lot of pain.

13:45.708 --> 13:48.375
You're a flea on the back
of a dragon.

13:48.458 --> 13:50.125
In for one hell of a ride.

13:51.083 --> 13:52.666
But you did manage to hang on.

13:53.708 --> 13:56.000
Mmm-hmm. I guess
that counts for something.

13:56.083 --> 13:58.166
I'm not sure you quite understand
the situation.

13:58.916 --> 13:59.916
You've lost.

14:01.416 --> 14:02.583
We found you.

14:04.791 --> 14:06.750
Duh. Of course you did.

14:07.625 --> 14:08.625
-Whoa!

14:08.708 --> 14:10.000
A swing and a miss.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.375
-

14:11.458 --> 14:13.041
So, we're still doing that, hmm?

14:14.125 --> 14:16.250
Let's get all this out of the way.

14:20.541 --> 14:21.541
Okay.

14:22.583 --> 14:23.583
Here we go.

14:27.416 --> 14:29.708
You can't kill me because

14:30.666 --> 14:33.291
I already know what's going to happen.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.500
See?

14:41.958 --> 14:43.041
It's a parlor trick.

14:43.125 --> 14:44.458
Okay.

14:44.541 --> 14:49.916
Don't you wonder how I'm able to get out
of the way just before you kill me?

14:50.000 --> 14:52.708
No. It's because of that little TemPad
you have there.

14:52.791 --> 14:53.791
HE WHO REMAINS: Right.

14:53.875 --> 14:59.500
But how do I already have it loaded up
with everything I need to know

14:59.583 --> 15:02.833
to keep from being killed by you two?

15:04.083 --> 15:05.125
It's easy.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.166
I know it all.

15:08.250 --> 15:10.041
And I've seen it all.

15:12.125 --> 15:14.791
Everything you guys
did on Lamentis, I saw.

15:15.333 --> 15:19.208
All the stuff the TVA
didn't know about, I knew.

15:19.291 --> 15:23.125
All the scheming, all the...

15:23.250 --> 15:25.000
...talking.

15:26.708 --> 15:29.958
That little look by the lake.

15:32.041 --> 15:35.291
Quite sentimental, very touching stuff,
by the way.

15:36.583 --> 15:37.916
No.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.958
No, we broke out of your little game.
That's how we got here.

15:42.041 --> 15:43.833
HE WHO REMAINS: No, wrong.

15:43.916 --> 15:47.958
Every step you took to get here,

15:48.041 --> 15:50.333
Lamentis, The Void,

15:51.333 --> 15:55.541
I paved the road.

15:57.833 --> 15:58.916
You...

16:00.916 --> 16:02.500
You just walked down it.

16:06.625 --> 16:09.541
And I have the rest,
uh, right here.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.208
Everything that's, uh...

16:13.375 --> 16:17.250
that's going to happen.
There's only one way this can go.

16:17.333 --> 16:19.250
Then why are we here?

16:19.333 --> 16:20.583
Oh, come on.

16:21.708 --> 16:25.583
You know you can't get to the end
until you've been changed by the journey.

16:25.666 --> 16:28.458
This stuff, it needs to happen.

16:29.208 --> 16:34.916
To get us all in the right mindset
to finish the quest.

16:35.875 --> 16:37.166
-Right.
-HE WHO REMAINS: Right.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.583
So, it's all a game.

16:38.666 --> 16:42.333
It's all... a manipulation.

16:42.416 --> 16:47.583
Interesting, that your head
would go to that.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.458
Sylvie,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
you think you can trust this guy?

16:53.083 --> 16:55.750
-Don't listen to him.
-"Don't listen to him."

16:55.833 --> 17:00.666
Do you think you're even capable
of trusting anyone at all?

17:06.250 --> 17:08.875
I think people are ready
to hear a little truth now.

17:08.958 --> 17:10.666
You know, like the TVA is a lie.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.541
But what if it's a necessary one?

17:13.750 --> 17:15.666
Someone created the Time-Keepers.

17:15.750 --> 17:18.583
They created this whole place.
They gave us all purpose.

17:18.666 --> 17:20.875
I have to believe they had a reason.

17:20.958 --> 17:24.250
No, because I've seen the horror
waiting for people when they get pruned

17:24.333 --> 17:26.125
and there's nothing necessary
about that.

17:26.208 --> 17:29.125
You know what would happen
if we didn't prune the Timeline?

17:29.208 --> 17:31.125
-MOBIUS: What?
-Chaos. Death.

17:31.208 --> 17:32.208
Free will?

17:32.333 --> 17:34.375
Free will?

17:34.458 --> 17:38.250
Only one person gets free will.
The one in charge.

17:43.625 --> 17:47.208
"Friends across time, allies to the end."

17:47.291 --> 17:49.416
-Shut up.
-MOBIUS: That was so beautiful.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.833
And then you sent me to die.
What happened to you?

17:53.416 --> 17:55.333
Nothing, Mobius. I didn't change.

17:55.416 --> 17:57.041
You didn't change? You betrayed me.

17:57.125 --> 17:58.875
No, no. You betrayed me!

18:00.583 --> 18:03.916
I looked out for you,
hung my neck out for you,

18:04.500 --> 18:08.250
and you suffer a crisis of faith
and turn to those Variants?

18:09.375 --> 18:10.625
Eons of friendship.

18:11.583 --> 18:14.916
And you threw it all away
on a couple of Lokis.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.125
No, Mobius. I didn't betray you.

18:20.625 --> 18:25.500
We can't take away people's free will,
Ravonna. Do you not see that?

18:26.708 --> 18:28.958
-What are you doing?
-What I need to do.

18:29.583 --> 18:30.791
Wait, stop.

18:30.875 --> 18:34.583
Look, maybe we can build this
into something better together.

18:34.708 --> 18:36.791
I'm sorry, Mobius.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.375
I'm not gonna let you go.

18:41.458 --> 18:42.458
RENSLAYER: Please, Mobius.

18:43.875 --> 18:45.083
Even with that...

18:46.708 --> 18:48.291
you're of no danger to me.

18:48.375 --> 18:49.916
Is that what you think?

18:50.708 --> 18:51.875
Let's see.

18:59.625 --> 19:00.958
Back here again.

19:06.458 --> 19:07.541
Go ahead.

19:20.833 --> 19:22.125
Where are you gonna go?

19:24.208 --> 19:25.708
In search of free will.

19:31.208 --> 19:35.416
I understand your moral objections
to what the TVA does.

19:37.666 --> 19:42.833
And my methods are deceptive.

19:43.833 --> 19:46.416
But the mission, it never was.

19:47.166 --> 19:51.583
Without the me, without the TVA...

19:54.416 --> 19:55.625
everything burns.

19:58.666 --> 20:00.333
Then what are you so afraid of?

20:09.958 --> 20:11.416
Me.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.416
And just who are you?

20:15.500 --> 20:19.541
Oh, I've been dubbed many names
by many people.

20:21.125 --> 20:24.708
A ruler, a conqueror.

20:26.708 --> 20:29.541
He Who Remains, a jerk.

20:30.875 --> 20:34.916
But it's... it's not as simple as a name.

20:45.208 --> 20:48.708
Eons ago, before the TVA,

20:48.791 --> 20:54.000
a variant of myself lived on Earth
in the 31st century.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.500
He was a scientist

20:56.583 --> 21:02.625
and he discovered that there were
universes stacked on top of his own.

21:02.708 --> 21:07.000
At the same time, other versions of us
were learning the same thing.

21:07.916 --> 21:12.958
Naturally, they made contact.
And for a while, there was peace.

21:13.041 --> 21:16.416
Narcissistic, self-congratulatory peace.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.166
"I love your shoes." "I love your hair."
"Oh, man, nice nose." "Thanks, man."

21:20.250 --> 21:21.333
Et cetera.

21:22.041 --> 21:25.250
They shared technology and knowledge.

21:26.541 --> 21:30.166
Using the best of their universes
to improve the others.

21:31.541 --> 21:32.541
However...

21:34.041 --> 21:38.708
not every version of me

21:38.791 --> 21:41.750
was so... so pure of heart.

21:43.541 --> 21:48.583
To some of us,
new worlds meant only one thing,

21:48.666 --> 21:51.708
new lands to be conquered.

21:52.833 --> 21:54.833
The peace between realities...

21:58.166 --> 22:02.125
...erupted into all-out war,

22:02.208 --> 22:06.500
each variant fighting to preserve
their universe

22:06.583 --> 22:09.500
and annihilate the others.

22:12.208 --> 22:15.500
...ladies and gentlemen,
of everything and everyone.

22:15.583 --> 22:18.958
And then the Time-Keepers
came along and saved us all.

22:19.708 --> 22:26.041
Amen

22:27.791 --> 22:29.791
No.

22:29.875 --> 22:33.250
Nope, this is where we diverge
from the dogma.

22:33.333 --> 22:36.333
That first variant encountered a creature

22:37.208 --> 22:40.416
created from all the tears in reality,

22:40.500 --> 22:43.791
capable of consuming time
and space itself.

22:43.875 --> 22:44.875
A creature...

22:46.583 --> 22:48.125
you both know.

22:49.625 --> 22:50.916
Alioth.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.500
HE WHO REMAINS: Bingo!

22:52.583 --> 22:57.250
I harnessed the beast's power
and began experimenting on it.

23:01.291 --> 23:04.041
I weaponized Alioth

23:06.000 --> 23:09.291
and I ended...
I ended the Multiversal War.

23:11.750 --> 23:13.708
Once I isolated our timeline,

23:14.958 --> 23:17.125
all I had to do
was manage the flow of time

23:17.208 --> 23:19.083
and prevent any further branches.

23:19.166 --> 23:21.625
Hence, the TVA.

23:21.708 --> 23:25.583
Hence, the Time-Keepers
and a highly efficient bureaucracy.

23:25.666 --> 23:30.958
...and ages of cosmic harmony.

23:31.041 --> 23:32.416
Hence...

23:33.291 --> 23:34.458
you're welcome.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.583
You came to kill the devil, right?

23:46.541 --> 23:47.666
Well, guess what?

23:48.833 --> 23:51.250
I keep you safe.

23:51.333 --> 23:56.916
And if you think I'm evil, well,

23:58.458 --> 24:03.208
just wait till you meet my variants.

24:08.750 --> 24:12.208
And that's the gambit.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.083
Stifling order or cataclysmic chaos.

24:18.875 --> 24:21.541
You may hate the dictator,
but something...

24:21.625 --> 24:24.541
...far worse is gonna fill that void
if you depose of him.

24:28.375 --> 24:30.916
I've lived a million lifetimes.

24:32.375 --> 24:34.500
I've gone through every scenario.

24:34.583 --> 24:36.625
This is the only way.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.083
The TVA,

24:40.416 --> 24:41.833
it works.

24:41.916 --> 24:45.041
Or you're a liar.

24:49.250 --> 24:50.375
Or I'm a liar.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.083
So you just...

24:55.333 --> 25:00.125
continue to prune innocent timelines?

25:00.208 --> 25:01.208
Mmm-mmm.

25:03.333 --> 25:04.333
You two would.

25:06.375 --> 25:08.791
There's two options! One...

25:10.250 --> 25:13.625
you kill me and destroy all this,
so you don't just have one devil,

25:13.708 --> 25:16.125
you have an infinite amount. Or...

25:17.291 --> 25:18.291
you two.

25:19.125 --> 25:20.541
You two run the thing.

25:21.333 --> 25:22.333
You're lying.

25:25.791 --> 25:27.791
Why would you give up being in control?

25:35.666 --> 25:36.666
Buddy...

25:39.375 --> 25:40.375
I'm tired.

25:42.833 --> 25:45.041
And I'm older.

25:47.291 --> 25:48.583
I'm older than I look.

25:51.416 --> 25:56.166
This game is for the young, the hungry.

26:00.416 --> 26:02.458
I've gone through a lot of scenarios...

26:03.500 --> 26:06.708
trying to find the right person
to take this spot.

26:09.291 --> 26:12.500
It turns out that person came in two.

26:16.083 --> 26:19.916
But it's definitely you two.

26:21.708 --> 26:23.958
So, no more lies.

26:25.083 --> 26:28.833
You kill me and the Sacred Timeline
is completely exposed.

26:28.916 --> 26:30.250
Multiversal War.

26:30.333 --> 26:36.333
Or you take over and return to the TVA
as its benevolent rulers.

26:36.833 --> 26:41.291
Tell the workforce who they are
and why they do what they do.

26:42.708 --> 26:47.208
You treated real people's lives
like some kind of game.

26:47.833 --> 26:52.000
It's not personal, it's practical.

26:52.083 --> 26:54.166
It was personal to me.

26:54.250 --> 26:58.458
Grow up! Grow up, Sylvie!

26:59.125 --> 27:01.041
Murderer! Hypocrite!

27:05.625 --> 27:10.416
We've all done horrible,
terrible, horrific things.

27:14.750 --> 27:17.833
But now, we, you...

27:19.875 --> 27:23.166
have a chance to do them
for a good reason.

27:48.916 --> 27:50.458
We just crossed...

27:51.791 --> 27:53.166
the threshold.

27:59.833 --> 28:01.541
-Oh.

28:18.041 --> 28:19.250
So, I fibbed.

28:21.250 --> 28:24.625
I fibbed earlier when I said
I know how everything's going to go. I...

28:25.250 --> 28:28.958
...everything up to a certain point,

28:29.041 --> 28:30.875
and that point was about...

28:33.875 --> 28:36.458
seven, eight, nine, ten seconds ago.

28:41.708 --> 28:42.958
But now I have no idea.

28:43.041 --> 28:45.500
No idea how the rest of this
is going to go.

28:48.625 --> 28:49.791
I'm being candid.

28:53.708 --> 28:54.708
So, that's it?

28:57.333 --> 28:58.416
That's it?

28:59.375 --> 29:02.375
This is what happens at the end of time?

29:03.625 --> 29:06.833
And now you're just gonna sit there
with all that freedom and...

29:08.500 --> 29:10.583
let us decide your fate?

29:10.666 --> 29:11.833
Yes!

29:11.916 --> 29:14.458
Yes! Yes! What's the worst
that can happen?

29:15.333 --> 29:16.333
You either...

29:17.208 --> 29:20.041
take over and my life's work continues

29:20.125 --> 29:25.583
or you plunge a blade in my chest
and an infinite amount of me...

29:27.041 --> 29:30.708
start another Multiversal War.
And I just...

29:35.833 --> 29:38.125
Reincarnation, baby.

29:38.208 --> 29:42.166
No, it's just another lie.

29:42.250 --> 29:44.875
Another manipulation.

29:46.541 --> 29:48.291
Oh.

29:48.375 --> 29:49.416
No lie.

29:51.291 --> 29:52.458
No manipulation.

30:12.833 --> 30:13.833
Wow.

30:20.625 --> 30:21.708
I love this.

30:25.041 --> 30:29.125
I love... all this honesty.

30:37.125 --> 30:38.625
Feels like a fresh start.

30:51.125 --> 30:52.708
-Oh, holy...
-

30:52.791 --> 30:54.541
-SYLVIE: What're you doing?
-Hang on a moment.

30:54.625 --> 30:56.791
Let's just talk about it.

30:56.875 --> 30:59.250
Well, how about we finish what we started
and kill him?

31:04.708 --> 31:06.458
-What if he's telling the truth?
-So what?

31:06.541 --> 31:07.833
-I believe him.
-Believe what?

31:07.916 --> 31:09.625
That a bazillion boogeymen
will turn up

31:09.708 --> 31:11.375
just because we give people free will?

31:11.458 --> 31:13.291
-He's a liar, Loki.
-So am I.

31:13.375 --> 31:16.000
And I don't think he was lying.
Not about that.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.583
Insane? Yes.
But maybe he was telling the truth.

31:18.666 --> 31:21.000
Better hurry.
Timeline's already branching.

31:21.083 --> 31:23.333
-So, what are you suggesting?
-That we think about it.

31:23.416 --> 31:25.541
And what precisely
is there to think about?

31:25.625 --> 31:27.750
Weren't you listening
to what he was saying?

31:27.833 --> 31:28.833
That's the gambit.

31:29.416 --> 31:31.708
Remove the dictator
and what fills the void?

31:33.625 --> 31:34.625
Ah.

31:35.833 --> 31:37.166
You want the throne?

31:37.833 --> 31:40.083
No, that's not it. No.

31:40.750 --> 31:43.416
-I don't believe you.
-Sylvie, the universe is in the balance,

31:43.500 --> 31:46.250
everything we know to be true. Everything.

31:47.375 --> 31:49.083
I know the TVA has hurt us both.

31:49.166 --> 31:50.791
But what if by taking him out,

31:50.875 --> 31:53.625
we risk unleashing something even worse?

31:54.750 --> 31:58.708
All I'm suggesting is we just
take a minute to think about it.

32:00.083 --> 32:03.041
I promise you from my heart
this isn't about a throne.

32:03.125 --> 32:05.166
What was I thinking trusting you?

32:06.958 --> 32:08.583
Has this whole thing been a con?

32:08.666 --> 32:09.666
Really?

32:11.166 --> 32:12.791
That's what you think of me...

32:14.125 --> 32:15.708
after all this time?

32:15.791 --> 32:17.041
Sure. Why not?

32:18.458 --> 32:20.666
Evil Loki's master plan comes together.

32:21.541 --> 32:24.750
Well, you never trusted me, did you?
What was the point?

32:26.083 --> 32:29.958
Can't you see?
This is bigger than our experience.

32:30.958 --> 32:32.666
Why aren't we seeing this the same way?

32:34.375 --> 32:35.833
Because you can't trust...

32:38.333 --> 32:39.833
and I can't be trusted.

32:42.250 --> 32:43.875
Then I guess we're in a pickle.

32:44.500 --> 32:45.500
Sylvie, wait.

32:46.750 --> 32:48.166
Wait.

33:14.333 --> 33:17.000
-Sylvie. Sylvie.
-

33:17.083 --> 33:19.750
Maybe he's lying! Maybe he's not.

33:19.833 --> 33:22.708
The cost of getting this wrong
is too great.

33:22.791 --> 33:24.333
Fine. Do it.

33:25.250 --> 33:27.833
Kill me. Take your throne.

33:27.916 --> 33:29.041
No.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.875
Sylvie, stop. Stop.

33:46.958 --> 33:50.041
-

33:54.416 --> 33:55.416
Stop.

34:02.750 --> 34:03.750
Stop.

34:09.333 --> 34:10.916
I've been where you are.

34:15.333 --> 34:17.166
I've felt what you feel.

34:21.416 --> 34:23.125
Don't ask me how I know.

34:25.916 --> 34:27.083
All I know...

34:29.666 --> 34:31.416
is I don't wanna hurt you.

34:34.541 --> 34:35.916
I don't want a throne.

34:39.333 --> 34:40.333
I just...

34:47.791 --> 34:49.666
I just want you to be okay.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.458
-

35:11.916 --> 35:13.291
But I'm not you.

35:22.750 --> 35:25.833
-

35:31.000 --> 35:32.333
HE WHO REMAINS: Incredible.

35:44.875 --> 35:46.833
Aren't you gonna beg for your life?

35:59.291 --> 36:00.500
I'll see you soon.

36:23.791 --> 36:26.125
-

37:19.833 --> 37:21.250
MOBIUS: No turning back now.

37:22.958 --> 37:25.041
Who said anything about turning back?

37:30.083 --> 37:31.166
"For all time."

37:34.708 --> 37:35.708
"Always."

38:47.291 --> 38:49.416
MAN: Copy. Reporting to the armory, sir.

39:07.083 --> 39:10.166
That's, what, 63 new branches
in this unit alone?

39:10.250 --> 39:12.458
Does he want us
to just let them all branch?

39:12.541 --> 39:15.125
-At this point, how are we gonna stop it?
-We can't!

39:15.208 --> 39:16.208
What?

39:17.083 --> 39:18.166
What'd you say?

39:19.166 --> 39:20.291
It's done, Mobius.

39:21.041 --> 39:22.416
We made a terrible mistake.

39:22.500 --> 39:23.958
-What's done?
- What?

39:24.625 --> 39:26.208
We freed the Timeline.

39:26.291 --> 39:29.708
We found him beyond the storm.

39:29.791 --> 39:32.083
A Citadel at the End of Time.

39:32.166 --> 39:35.000
