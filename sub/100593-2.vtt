WEBVTT

01:23.625 --> 01:28.547
Sterling! Sterling, pick up your feet!

01:29.256 --> 01:31.967
Tuka, shut the hell up!

02:31.860 --> 02:33.300
Come on, come on, come on. Let's go.

02:38.534 --> 02:40.494
That's what I'm talking about. And one!

02:41.411 --> 02:43.455
Wrong sport. Good game though.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.124
Word.

02:49.670 --> 02:53.173
You legit for finding this spot.
Super cutty.

02:53.257 --> 02:54.967
Still can't get over the view.

02:55.801 --> 03:00.222
Regular-ass, normal humans, when they
say "the view," they mean a sunset.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.933
Come on, fam. Like, what's more pretty
than that right there?

03:03.350 --> 03:05.561
Probably don't even know
how lucky they is.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.729
They are. They know.

03:09.398 --> 03:12.568
They should know.
Tuka Hall's coming for they ass!

03:13.569 --> 03:16.697
You about to snitch
on the whole situation. A "snitchuation."

03:17.281 --> 03:20.158
Sorry. I'm just super juiced.

03:20.242 --> 03:23.537
Couple weeks till the Stokes-Pickett
Invitational on that track.

03:23.620 --> 03:27.416
- Not that crap concrete at school.
- Right.

03:27.499 --> 03:30.669
Coach Ry says something
like 20 recruiters supposed to come out.

03:31.253 --> 03:33.213
Anybody who gets a decent time in the 400

03:33.297 --> 03:35.299
will get a look
at that good scholly money.

03:35.382 --> 03:40.220
So, you, Elaine Hinton from Cole,
Kiki Williams from Montcastle.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.347
Same old roster. It's cool.

03:43.223 --> 03:46.476
I'll watch all your college meets
on the TVs at Walmart...

03:47.102 --> 03:48.812
- on my break.
- I told you.

03:48.896 --> 03:52.024
You get your time under 55 seconds,
dominate invitationals,

03:52.107 --> 03:54.568
get recruited and beast in the NCAA.

03:55.527 --> 03:58.030
For the next few weeks,
we eat track, sleep track.

03:58.113 --> 04:00.532
And if it ain't about track,
we ain't about that.

04:00.616 --> 04:04.494
I said, "We eat track, we sleep track,
and if it ain't about track," what?

04:05.579 --> 04:07.664
"If it ain't about track,
we ain't about that."

04:07.748 --> 04:14.129
Look, after I cut my time and we win
and we get our faces on the news,

04:14.838 --> 04:17.257
could we talk a little about the future?

04:17.798 --> 04:21.094
With the future again?
I told you the plan.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.096
We train, cut time and...

04:23.931 --> 04:25.724
the future will handle itself, right?

04:27.142 --> 04:28.727
- Yep.
- Good.

04:31.730 --> 04:32.773
Okay.

04:32.856 --> 04:38.195
What about Marion Jones, no sauce,
versus Marie-JosÃ©e?

04:38.278 --> 04:40.072
- Head-to-head?
- I hate you for that.

04:40.656 --> 04:42.991
I'm lightweight blown
you didn't even mention Florence.

04:43.075 --> 04:44.826
A different era. Apples to oranges.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.287
I would have made a fruit salad
out of all them chicks.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.706
Damn, girl. Humble ever?

04:56.421 --> 04:59.341
Yo, what's the point of having an altar
if nobody takes care of it?

05:00.425 --> 05:03.762
Never understood why people
do the whole bronze thing.

05:04.179 --> 05:07.266
He can't hoop or do a skateboard
if he's dead.

05:07.766 --> 05:08.892
You don't know.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.061
He could be nice
with those afterlife skate tricks.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.897
I don't think it works like that.

05:17.109 --> 05:20.863
Sterling, if you gonna be out
in this weather, you gonna need a sweater.

05:20.946 --> 05:22.072
You get sick if you want,

05:22.155 --> 05:25.075
but you are not gonna infect my house
'cause you don't agree it's chilly.

05:26.118 --> 05:28.412
Petrushka, you eatin' with us?

05:28.495 --> 05:30.706
No, ma'am.
Don't wanna wear out my welcome.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.876
Besides, I maybe have plans.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.671
Well, you change your mind,
we always make a plate for you anyway.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.484
You gonna be able to get outta here
and meet me at the sideshow?

05:41.508 --> 05:44.595
No, she will not be going
to the illegal drag race

05:44.678 --> 05:47.598
where everyone gets arrested!

05:47.681 --> 05:49.308
Who calls it a drag race?

05:49.391 --> 05:51.768
I don't know why she always
gotta be in my business.

05:51.852 --> 05:52.853
What was that?

06:00.194 --> 06:02.529
I wanna go, but...

06:04.323 --> 06:05.967
This little girl
might need to get some rest.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.869
Watch film. "Eat track. Sleep track"?

06:10.037 --> 06:11.705
You really gonna make me go all alone?

06:11.788 --> 06:13.165
You know you're a brat, right?

06:20.756 --> 06:22.132
Maybe.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.947
Yo, this is hella crazy.

07:08.804 --> 07:09.805
Tuka!

07:10.639 --> 07:12.766
There she go, there she go, there she go!

07:12.850 --> 07:16.645
Hey, Lee
you-gotsta-say-the-whole-name Easton.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.748
You took tonight off?
Who's coverin' at the restaurant?

07:18.772 --> 07:20.399
Hey, that fish can fry itself.

07:20.816 --> 07:23.193
I figured y'all was coming,
so I was about it, off top.

07:25.153 --> 07:28.991
How'd Sterling get out though? Yo.

07:31.493 --> 07:35.330
Look, anyone asks, we had a last-minute,
late-night track practice

07:35.414 --> 07:36.832
very close to the sideshow.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.584
- I got you.
- Hey, we got you.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.254
- Yo!
- Come on, now.

08:15.204 --> 08:17.372
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, what?

08:23.879 --> 08:25.714
He hit that corner so hard.

08:32.888 --> 08:34.306
About that time, I think.

08:35.307 --> 08:36.308
Already?

08:36.390 --> 08:40.102
What is it, like, 10:15?
Blood, you legit nerdy.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.940
I wanna be in bed before 11:00.

08:43.315 --> 08:47.736
Look, even the super-ultra extra square
kids stay out till at least midnight.

08:53.492 --> 08:54.868
You don't get it.

08:54.952 --> 08:57.704
I work hard for it, every day,
just to keep your pace.

08:57.788 --> 08:58.789
My bad, Ster, I...

08:58.872 --> 09:02.376
I break myself
just to be seconds slower than you.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.712
Stay if you want. I need sleep.

09:05.796 --> 09:06.797
My bad.

09:27.985 --> 09:31.405
Hey, yo, blood! Hey, Sterling, wait up!

09:37.369 --> 09:38.829
Sterling!

09:38.912 --> 09:40.455
Bro, I said I'm sorry.

09:46.545 --> 09:49.756
Sterling Johnson, who secretly
loves Taylor Swift and hates onions,

09:49.840 --> 09:51.258
I'm talking to you!

09:53.719 --> 09:54.761
Hey...

09:55.929 --> 09:57.055
What you doing?

09:57.848 --> 10:00.851
Move! Tuka! Car! Move!

10:01.476 --> 10:04.271
Tuka, move!

11:59.261 --> 12:00.929
Amen.

12:01.013 --> 12:04.099
We wanna thank the choir
for that offering,

12:04.600 --> 12:08.020
the deacons and deaconesses
who have responded

12:08.103 --> 12:12.149
to Tuka's loved ones
in their time of need.

12:13.275 --> 12:14.276
Miss Johnson.

12:34.296 --> 12:38.550
For the record,
nobody's allowed to call her Petrushka.

12:39.343 --> 12:45.557
Still. Tuka Myrtle Hall
was born in 2002 in Oakland.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.645
She is survived by her cousin, Noah Terry,
in Fresno,

12:50.145 --> 12:53.190
her great-aunt Hazel in Modesto and...

12:55.192 --> 12:57.569
and her best friend since age six...

12:59.571 --> 13:00.948
Sterling Johnson.

13:01.865 --> 13:03.951
Oh, no, no, no. Y'all got me messed up.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.995
I'm not dead. I'm right here.

13:13.544 --> 13:17.339
She boasted the area's fastest time
in women's 400 meter...

13:18.590 --> 13:22.386
setting regional records
her last two seasons.

13:23.095 --> 13:25.097
See? See? I'm not dead!

13:25.973 --> 13:27.307
I'm here!

13:28.642 --> 13:30.102
Come on, fam.

13:30.185 --> 13:32.229
There's gotta be something we can do...

13:33.397 --> 13:34.940
or somebody we can talk to!

13:44.908 --> 13:49.413
At this time, you may choose to recess
or stay seated to view the remains.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.225
No! No! No!

14:51.850 --> 14:53.769
No! No! No!

15:10.994 --> 15:13.830
Right... here.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.335
Sterling was there.

15:20.671 --> 15:22.214
And she waved at me.

15:23.465 --> 15:25.259
And I waved back, and...

15:39.898 --> 15:43.652
Well, the only way
anyone would touch my track cleats

15:43.735 --> 15:45.696
was if they wanted to die...

15:48.282 --> 15:49.449
or if I did.

15:53.287 --> 15:56.790
But if I'm dead, why am I still here
posted on the same broke block?

16:01.044 --> 16:04.882
I'm supposed to... ascend, maybe.

16:11.305 --> 16:13.015
No one can see me.

16:14.850 --> 16:16.351
Nobody can hear me!

16:22.941 --> 16:24.484
I'm just Tuka Hall.

16:26.445 --> 16:28.197
Stuck here until...

16:59.019 --> 17:00.062
Lee stopped by.

17:05.651 --> 17:10.155
I just came by to make sure you're good.
Or as good as possible.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.742
Can I sit?

17:23.544 --> 17:25.627
You did good at the services today.

17:26.421 --> 17:28.006
What you said up there was perfect.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.842
Nothing was perfect about today.

17:33.095 --> 17:35.264
It's my fault. I killed her.

17:37.599 --> 17:38.809
What are you talkin' about?

17:41.603 --> 17:44.398
I should have stayed at
that dumb-ass sideshow like she wanted.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.483
Was easy. Could've just posted there.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.819
I yelled at her, then I left.

17:49.236 --> 17:52.114
I heard her calling my name,
and I pretended I didn't.

17:53.282 --> 17:55.993
I made her run after me. I ignored her.

17:58.704 --> 18:00.330
You know that's not on you.

18:01.498 --> 18:03.375
You were tired. It's okay to be that.

18:03.917 --> 18:04.918
But I was...

18:05.002 --> 18:07.671
You know I loved Tuka,
but that girl never stopped.

18:08.213 --> 18:10.465
Keeping up with her was impossible.
Be real.

18:10.549 --> 18:12.134
She was always doing the most.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.553
Right? You know I am.

18:15.053 --> 18:18.891
The only person you should blame
is that coward who hit her and dipped.

18:19.349 --> 18:20.475
That don't help.

18:21.268 --> 18:24.313
That guy gets away with it
1,000% of the time.

18:24.855 --> 18:26.190
You went to the cops yet?

18:31.945 --> 18:35.115
I gave a description of the car
and the driver a couple days ago.

18:38.202 --> 18:39.620
Can't even get a callback.

18:45.501 --> 18:48.212
So let's go over there. Make 'em listen.

18:49.505 --> 18:50.756
Now?

18:56.887 --> 18:58.096
Let me change.

19:06.897 --> 19:08.273
Thanks, Lee.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.409
Look, I'm not aiming to be a dick.

19:19.493 --> 19:24.248
Your description, it literally matches
thousands of men in the system.

19:25.123 --> 19:28.544
Now, the car? Likely in a chop shop.

19:29.920 --> 19:33.757
Nine pages of search results
for "auto body near me."

19:34.550 --> 19:35.843
Where would you start?

19:36.844 --> 19:39.137
There were a ton of people
at that illegal sideshow.

19:39.805 --> 19:42.474
Our detectives walked every inch
of that precinct,

19:42.558 --> 19:43.851
spoke to everyone.

19:43.934 --> 19:46.144
- No one's talking.
- All people do is jaw jack.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.229
Not when we're around.

19:47.312 --> 19:48.689
Shoulda known sooner.

19:48.772 --> 19:51.358
So, that's it? That's all that y'all do?

19:51.441 --> 19:54.862
Come back with more information,
and you have my word, we'll act on it.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.243
Yep. That's my girl!

20:01.785 --> 20:03.370
That's hella extra, Sterling.

20:10.085 --> 20:11.128
Hey, I'm sorry.

20:12.045 --> 20:15.048
She's just real upset.
That girl was her best friend.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.719
She should be upset.
Nothing fair about it.

20:22.472 --> 20:26.476
I thought this might help her move on,
but... I don't know.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.105
She could be stuck on this forever.

20:33.192 --> 20:35.611
You know, Officer, Lee's right.

20:36.737 --> 20:38.363
Sterling clearly needs help.

20:39.740 --> 20:42.159
Maybe that's why I'm not
in the white light or whatever.

20:45.120 --> 20:48.957
You think cops have it hard?
Nobody talks to dead people either.

20:51.460 --> 20:54.838
Then again, they don't stop talkin'
when I come around.

20:59.051 --> 21:00.052
I could use that.

21:19.404 --> 21:23.659
Come on, seven! Feel real lucky.
Daddy needs train fare.

21:24.117 --> 21:27.579
So we pulled a fast little lick.
It was me, Tyshon, Merv.

21:27.663 --> 21:31.583
Caught a smooth rack,
cashed out baby moms. You know the deal.

21:31.667 --> 21:34.253
So, then I was like,
"Forget his cattin' ass.

21:34.336 --> 21:35.796
He got me for a hundred dollars."

21:35.879 --> 21:39.299
So, I showed up to the hut
with the burner like...

21:40.676 --> 21:41.718
I say you go hammy.

21:41.802 --> 21:44.721
You could get the number one,
but I'd rather put some lines in for you.

21:44.805 --> 21:46.390
Oh, okay. Sounds good.

21:48.141 --> 21:49.142
And in the end,

21:49.226 --> 21:51.895
the county sheriff is at my door
at the crack of dawn,

21:51.979 --> 21:53.355
talkin' 'bout eviction.

21:53.438 --> 21:54.898
You are not serious.

21:54.982 --> 21:59.069
Promise you won't tell nobody,
but Gina, she's pregnant,

21:59.152 --> 22:00.529
and she don't know whose it is.

22:00.612 --> 22:02.197
People stay on that ol' bull.

22:02.281 --> 22:03.699
- Baller.
- They got nothing.

22:04.533 --> 22:06.660
Oh, yeah. I can do some moves for you too.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.453
Yeah. He get rid of the car?

22:08.537 --> 22:10.455
You kidding? He love that whip.

22:10.539 --> 22:13.458
Cops don't got a plate.
All they know it's a green Caprice.

22:13.542 --> 22:15.043
Gotta store it till things cool off.

22:16.670 --> 22:18.505
- It's at Lex Custom Auto?
- Yep.

22:18.589 --> 22:20.108
He better hope nobody at that shop snitch.

22:20.132 --> 22:22.217
Never happen.
Everybody at Lex know better.

22:22.301 --> 22:23.302
If you say so.

22:26.013 --> 22:27.181
Get in there.

22:27.264 --> 22:32.019
Got it. Lex. Good looking out, J cats.

22:36.857 --> 22:38.066
Glad to see you, Ster.

22:38.817 --> 22:42.487
Wasn't sure when or if you'd feel
up for practice. You good to go?

22:44.156 --> 22:45.199
I'm here, aren't I?

22:45.282 --> 22:47.284
Okay, you're next.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.412
I want intensity, and I want control.

22:52.497 --> 22:55.000
Sterling. Yo, hold up, man.

22:57.044 --> 22:59.379
If there's anyone in the world
who can hear me, it's you.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.466
Try. Come on, man.

23:03.842 --> 23:07.471
Sterling! Hey! Yo, listen to me!

23:07.554 --> 23:09.264
- Ready!
- Hey.

23:10.057 --> 23:11.225
Set!

23:15.395 --> 23:17.105
Look, I know you can hear me, Sterling.

23:17.856 --> 23:22.444
Listen, the car's at Lex Custom Auto.
Lex Custom Auto!

23:25.614 --> 23:26.782
Damn it, Sterling. Listen.

23:27.491 --> 23:29.117
Lex Custom Auto!

23:30.452 --> 23:31.578
Lex!

23:34.665 --> 23:38.168
- Tuka?
- Yeah. You heard me. You hella did.

23:38.252 --> 23:39.253
I'm tripping.

23:39.336 --> 23:41.022
Nothing can separate us,
even with this weird...

23:41.046 --> 23:42.965
- You good, girl?
- Don't put your hands on me.

23:43.048 --> 23:44.716
Dang, I'm just asking if you was cool.

23:45.759 --> 23:46.760
Who do you think you are?

23:46.844 --> 23:48.345
- Don't touch me.
- Don't push me.

23:48.428 --> 23:51.306
Hey! I know you two bobbleheads
ain't bickering on my track.

23:51.390 --> 23:52.891
- She started it.
- Enough.

23:53.433 --> 23:56.645
Ramos, water break. Go!

24:00.023 --> 24:01.483
Child, what is going on with you?

24:02.401 --> 24:03.485
I can't do this anymore.

24:03.569 --> 24:05.362
Yes, you can, Sterling. You can!

24:14.246 --> 24:15.455
Thinking I heard stuff.

24:15.539 --> 24:18.083
Got me messed up
if you think I'm going crazy.

24:18.917 --> 24:20.752
Not me. Not today.

24:33.891 --> 24:37.936
Come on, Sterling. Come on.
You see it. You gotta know.

25:13.972 --> 25:16.350
Green Caprice, blacked-out rims.

25:16.892 --> 25:19.311
Green Caprice, blacked-out rims.

25:19.394 --> 25:20.687
Green Caprice, black...

25:50.300 --> 25:51.468
Maybe I was wrong.

25:52.636 --> 25:55.556
Oh, yeah. A voice told me, "Go to Lex."

26:16.660 --> 26:17.870
Right make.

26:24.501 --> 26:25.586
Right model.

26:44.313 --> 26:45.689
Dang, you were right.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.357
Death don't change facts.

26:47.441 --> 26:49.234
Hey, what do ya think you're doing?

26:53.906 --> 26:55.199
Whose car is this?

26:55.824 --> 26:57.868
Sorry, it's confidential.

26:58.493 --> 27:02.581
Don't push it. You found the whip. Be out.

27:04.082 --> 27:06.168
You know this car was involved
in a hit-and-run?

27:06.251 --> 27:08.837
- Fall back, Ster.
- I think it's time for you to go.

27:08.921 --> 27:10.964
Strong agree with the greasy dude.

27:16.678 --> 27:20.557
Tell me whose it is,
or his repair's gonna be hella expensive.

27:20.641 --> 27:21.725
Sterling, what are you on?

27:21.808 --> 27:23.727
I'm not playing. Put that down.

27:29.483 --> 27:32.152
- Last warning, little girl!
- Go!

27:32.694 --> 27:33.820
You think I care?

27:37.199 --> 27:40.202
He killed my friend
and rode off like she was nothing!

27:40.953 --> 27:41.954
Stop!

27:47.167 --> 27:49.253
Okay. Okay.

27:51.046 --> 27:52.256
You're right. You're right.

27:54.967 --> 27:58.637
I'm dumb. I didn't mean this. Okay.

28:09.189 --> 28:10.899
Hey! Hey, Sterling!

28:12.150 --> 28:13.235
Sterling, wait up!

28:14.194 --> 28:15.821
Leave me alone!

28:18.615 --> 28:19.616
Wait up.

28:23.579 --> 28:24.830
My bad.

28:26.832 --> 28:27.833
No, my bad.

28:28.834 --> 28:29.960
How did you do that?

28:30.919 --> 28:32.004
You can see me?

28:37.176 --> 28:39.219
Hey, yo! You, up ahead.

28:40.053 --> 28:42.097
Yo, you on the skateboard. Wait up.

28:44.391 --> 28:46.143
My bad, yo. I didn't mean to run into you.

28:46.226 --> 28:48.729
Who cares?
If you can see me, I need your help.

28:49.938 --> 28:52.024
DJ... Williams.

28:53.066 --> 28:54.067
Tuka Hall.

28:54.693 --> 28:58.405
Hey, you the girl with the new altar,
right? The one with the quick feet?

28:59.072 --> 29:00.073
Used to be.

29:00.949 --> 29:02.492
So, how do you like your afterlife?

29:02.576 --> 29:03.660
It's cool or whatever.

29:04.077 --> 29:06.163
Mostly I'm just juiced to see somebody
like me.

29:07.748 --> 29:08.749
I thought I was alone.

29:09.416 --> 29:11.919
You are. And not.

29:12.878 --> 29:14.379
It's confusing.

29:14.463 --> 29:16.673
You know, one minute
you in the club gettin' faded.

29:17.758 --> 29:22.471
Next minute you in the hood
with no money and no bills. It's weird.

29:23.222 --> 29:25.641
I spent the whole first year
just talking to myself.

29:26.642 --> 29:29.061
Nobody to chop it with. Till you.

29:29.978 --> 29:31.778
You know what we're supposed
to be doing here?

29:33.148 --> 29:34.650
I honestly don't.

29:35.234 --> 29:38.195
My neighbor, Ms. Tramble,
she died at a hundred.

29:39.238 --> 29:40.781
She was stuck here a couple days.

29:41.490 --> 29:45.118
Worried about her dog.
The moment she found him a home, poof.

29:45.994 --> 29:47.314
I saw her, like, get sucked away.

29:47.913 --> 29:52.751
So... we're in between then?
Like, limbo or something?

29:52.835 --> 29:53.961
Seems like it.

29:55.170 --> 29:57.172
At first,
I tried a bunch of stuff to get out.

29:58.340 --> 30:00.008
You know, helped fam keep the house.

30:01.134 --> 30:02.386
Helped some strangers too.

30:03.512 --> 30:04.763
Nothing happened.

30:05.556 --> 30:08.392
To keep it a hundred though,
I wasn't really doing much before I died.

30:10.143 --> 30:11.937
Maybe I gotta do something worthwhile.

30:13.146 --> 30:14.815
You know, really change somebody's life.

30:15.649 --> 30:17.484
Yeah, it's just like in the movies.

30:18.277 --> 30:20.487
Get your angel wings,
you hear a bell or something.

30:20.988 --> 30:23.949
I tell you right now, ain't 'bout to be
no angel wings or bells.

30:24.783 --> 30:27.661
I hope I get a pair of new kicks,
and they play a Bay slap.

30:28.287 --> 30:29.288
Something classic.

30:30.289 --> 30:32.291
So, you just mobbing it around the town

30:32.708 --> 30:35.961
doing kind things for people
till you figure it out?

30:36.587 --> 30:41.633
Basically. You probably gotta do the same.
You know, do something big.

30:43.594 --> 30:46.263
Is it anything you didn't finish
while you were living, maybe?

30:47.598 --> 30:49.766
Yeah, living.

30:59.568 --> 31:02.279
This is dumb. Ain't nobody out there.

31:05.782 --> 31:09.453
Tuka, you here?

31:13.290 --> 31:16.710
Tuka Myrtle Hall, stop playing.

31:17.961 --> 31:19.081
If you can see me right now,

31:19.129 --> 31:21.965
- you probably laughing real hard.
- You do look low-key ridiculous.

31:23.759 --> 31:25.010
I knew you'd come back here.

31:27.721 --> 31:28.972
This probably won't work.

31:30.516 --> 31:34.186
But... I gotta know.

31:38.148 --> 31:40.901
I heard you
when I was running here before.

31:42.444 --> 31:44.696
I heard you when I was running from Lex.

31:48.033 --> 31:49.034
So...

31:52.204 --> 31:53.580
I'm gonna start running now.

31:55.999 --> 31:57.292
Great. Perfect.

32:11.515 --> 32:17.729
Sterling. Sterling, you are crazy,
but not about this.

32:17.813 --> 32:20.023
Are you there? Tuka?

32:23.902 --> 32:27.072
Tuka Hall is not showing up
to chat over a light jog.

32:27.698 --> 32:29.950
How about now?

32:30.659 --> 32:32.953
Oh, please. You can do better than that.

32:33.871 --> 32:39.209
Legit. No, like, actually and for real?

32:39.293 --> 32:41.837
You there? Really there?

32:41.920 --> 32:42.921
Yep.

32:45.174 --> 32:46.814
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

32:48.552 --> 32:50.429
But how?

32:51.680 --> 32:52.806
Are you okay?

32:52.890 --> 32:56.101
You know as much as I do.
I talked to this other dead dude.

32:57.519 --> 32:58.979
There are others?

32:59.062 --> 33:00.522
Only the one so far.

33:00.606 --> 33:05.235
He says he thinks there's something
I have to do to, you know, really move on.

33:05.819 --> 33:09.156
Can you talk to anybody else?

33:09.239 --> 33:11.533
Only you. And only when you're running.

33:12.201 --> 33:15.412
Well, I can talk all the time,
but you can hear me now.

33:16.955 --> 33:19.791
Maybe you're supposed to run.

33:22.252 --> 33:25.964
No. Nah, you supposed to run.

33:26.840 --> 33:30.093
The night I died, I told you I'd get
your time down for invitationals.

33:30.177 --> 33:34.306
Only you would come back to haunt somebody
over a race, I swear.

33:34.389 --> 33:36.391
Bruh, it's perfect.

33:37.059 --> 33:40.020
I'm gonna get you into college.
You gonna get me into the next life.

33:40.646 --> 33:42.189
It's just like we planned it.

33:42.272 --> 33:43.857
Only totally different.

33:45.359 --> 33:47.027
Nice to hear your voice though.

33:47.110 --> 33:48.278
It's nice to be heard.

33:49.071 --> 33:52.241
And now that I got you on my line,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

33:52.324 --> 33:54.743
Go ahead then. I ain't scared of no ghost.

33:55.118 --> 33:58.956
Knees up. Come on. Come on.
Come on! Up! Up!

33:59.039 --> 34:01.959
I am not, I repeat,
not here for fun and games.

34:02.042 --> 34:05.128
We gonna get you under 55 seconds
even if it kills me. Come on, girl.

34:05.212 --> 34:06.815
- That ain't funny.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

34:06.839 --> 34:08.632
I need you to be fast.

34:09.007 --> 34:10.092
I'm trying.

34:12.261 --> 34:16.014
Another one? The one where my leg's
coming up, but keep my feet on the ground.

34:16.098 --> 34:19.309
Watch the way your heel strikes.
And what's with your breath?

34:26.233 --> 34:27.943
Come on, Ster. Bring your arms in.

34:28.025 --> 34:30.195
The closer they are,
the closer you are to first place.

34:30.279 --> 34:32.364
Invitational's not that far away.
Let's go!

34:34.992 --> 34:37.995
Keep your shoulders square and your breath
more tight. Breath. Breath.

34:41.623 --> 34:46.170
56.32 again?
All the top times last year were under 55.

34:46.253 --> 34:47.963
That just means you gotta grind harder.

34:48.045 --> 34:49.672
Feet up. Feet up. Feet up!

34:53.802 --> 34:55.469
Feet up. Feet up. Feet up.

34:55.554 --> 34:57.157
You know what's
the most interesting thing?

34:57.181 --> 34:59.183
I don't even get side cramps anymore.
That's the...

35:01.435 --> 35:04.146
I'm like a butterfly. Yeah!

35:05.397 --> 35:06.398
Yes.

35:57.324 --> 35:58.700
There it is.

35:58.784 --> 36:01.370
There we go. 54.98!

36:01.453 --> 36:04.122
That's what I'm talking about.
I knew you could do it.

36:04.206 --> 36:07.835
54.98, 54.98.

36:07.918 --> 36:11.171
Johnson, you talking to yourself again?

36:11.255 --> 36:13.757
No. It just helps me train.

36:14.424 --> 36:16.385
Well, whatever you're doing, it's working.

36:17.511 --> 36:18.512
Thank you.

36:18.595 --> 36:20.597
Getting serious about invitationals,
I see.

36:20.681 --> 36:21.890
Very much so.

36:22.391 --> 36:24.893
All right. Keep taking those seconds off.

36:31.483 --> 36:32.484
Tuka?

36:36.822 --> 36:40.325
Tuka... you out there?

37:00.637 --> 37:06.059
Okay, bruh... or spirit mother,
or whoever's up there.

37:07.311 --> 37:09.229
Yo, what kinda operation you running?

37:09.938 --> 37:13.275
I had one,
one person in the whole universe.

37:13.358 --> 37:16.486
Somebody who knew
when I was low or happy or angry.

37:16.570 --> 37:19.656
Somebody who saw me for me
and liked me anyway.

37:19.740 --> 37:20.991
We had plans.

37:21.617 --> 37:25.245
I never even got to hug her and say,
"Ster, everything's gonna be okay."

37:26.038 --> 37:28.332
But it's okay. It is.

37:28.999 --> 37:31.210
I did that. I got her ready.

37:31.293 --> 37:35.130
And she's gonna live a beautiful life
with Lee and track

37:35.214 --> 37:37.591
and the prom and ice cream.

37:37.674 --> 37:40.719
And me? Yo, what about...

37:42.596 --> 37:45.641
I have been every kind of invisible,
alive and dead.

37:45.724 --> 37:47.267
It tore me up inside.

37:47.851 --> 37:52.272
But enough. I did what you wanted.
Don't make me stay here and watch!

38:20.092 --> 38:22.302
Hey, slick. Hold up a sec.

38:24.054 --> 38:25.055
Been looking for you.

38:25.597 --> 38:26.598
What for?

38:26.682 --> 38:29.518
Don't play stupid.
You bashed the hell out of my car.

38:30.602 --> 38:32.271
- No?
- No.

38:36.483 --> 38:37.568
I did.

38:38.902 --> 38:42.489
I may have accidentally damaged a car
that looked similar to the one...

38:43.782 --> 38:44.992
that killed my friend.

38:46.827 --> 38:47.828
You know it?

38:48.745 --> 38:53.125
What I heard... your friend
died in a tragic accident. Right?

38:55.711 --> 38:56.837
Right.

38:58.213 --> 38:59.840
Looks like she needs some motivation.

39:16.023 --> 39:19.735
Yo, somebody help her! Somebody help!

39:27.951 --> 39:29.578
I'm so sorry, Ster.

39:44.051 --> 39:45.177
<i>On your marks...</i>

39:49.223 --> 39:50.224
<i>Set.</i>

40:03.695 --> 40:05.697
The child wants to run today. Run.

40:05.781 --> 40:07.032
Do you believe that?

40:07.115 --> 40:11.119
Someone talk some sense into this girl,
'cause she can't hear me.

40:11.203 --> 40:15.207
It doesn't make sense that you should run.
But how could you not?

40:15.290 --> 40:19.419
Johnson, one tweak,
one false step, goodbye ACL.

40:19.503 --> 40:21.296
You need at least two weeks. Maybe three.

40:22.589 --> 40:26.009
The recruiters will find someone
out there today, and it has to be me.

40:26.552 --> 40:28.470
And Tuka would hate it if I quit now.

40:28.554 --> 40:30.430
She would hate it
if you destroyed your knee.

40:30.514 --> 40:33.559
Nah. You don't understand.
Tuka and I had a vision.

40:33.976 --> 40:38.188
Do you know how hard it is to keep
this together? Especially here. Now.

40:38.897 --> 40:41.108
Three weeks ago,
I wouldn't get out of bed. I couldn't.

40:41.441 --> 40:44.278
But I promised Tuka
I'm gonna win this meet.

40:44.778 --> 40:46.488
It's the only thing keeping me sane.

40:47.322 --> 40:49.533
Clear me. Don't clear me. I don't care.

40:50.617 --> 40:52.369
I'm running this race today.

40:53.579 --> 40:54.830
That's my girl.

40:56.665 --> 40:59.001
<i>Ladies, you can get your blocks set up.</i>

40:59.084 --> 41:02.296
<i>Take a short run around,
then return to your blocks.</i>

42:04.733 --> 42:05.984
<i>On your marks...</i>

42:11.782 --> 42:12.950
<i>Set.</i>

42:24.461 --> 42:26.213
Sterling Johnson, you better work!

42:39.393 --> 42:41.144
Yes! Yes!

42:47.025 --> 42:48.465
- Come on, Ster!
- Come on! Let's go!

43:00.873 --> 43:02.541
You got this! Yes!

43:31.153 --> 43:32.571
- Get up! Come on.
- Yo! Get up!

44:32.130 --> 44:33.340
I know you're there.

44:35.092 --> 44:36.218
I can feel it.

44:41.139 --> 44:44.560
I just want you to know how pissed I am
that we can't talk.

44:44.643 --> 44:45.894
I don't get it.

44:46.770 --> 44:49.773
Why did they leave me here to train you
if you were only gonna lose?

45:05.163 --> 45:06.498
I hate this.

45:07.666 --> 45:10.377
I shoulda never left that sideshow early.

45:10.460 --> 45:12.171
I shoulda left with you.

45:12.254 --> 45:15.465
I shoulda just, for once,
told you something real.

45:15.549 --> 45:18.844
We were right here next to each other,
and I had a chance.

45:18.927 --> 45:21.847
I made you wait till after the race
for nothing.

45:21.930 --> 45:23.056
But I waited.

45:27.477 --> 45:30.063
And now my knee is garbage,
and I can't run.

45:32.524 --> 45:33.859
So we can't talk.

45:37.988 --> 45:42.117
And everything's just hella bad.
Like everything I touch.

45:44.786 --> 45:45.787
But...

45:50.000 --> 45:51.001
I gotta tell you.

45:55.339 --> 45:56.340
Tell me?

46:11.730 --> 46:15.484
It's something I feel... felt...

46:19.821 --> 46:23.033
Something I wanted to say
since a while now.

46:24.243 --> 46:27.996
Damn, girl. You all shook.
Just say it. It's good.

46:30.791 --> 46:32.125
It's like, okay...

46:34.169 --> 46:35.170
It's like...

46:38.131 --> 46:40.551
We're friends, but also...

46:40.634 --> 46:41.969
Also what?

46:42.553 --> 46:44.555
I try to make myself not.

46:45.973 --> 46:50.602
Not hear you. Not need you. Not care.

46:54.064 --> 46:58.360
But it just... It just doesn't go away.

46:59.528 --> 47:03.782
And then... you did.

47:03.866 --> 47:07.202
I never left. I couldn't.

47:07.286 --> 47:11.748
Oh, my God. Just say it.
Just push through.

47:12.416 --> 47:14.918
It shouldn't be this damn hard.

47:17.713 --> 47:19.464
I love you too, Sterling.

47:20.174 --> 47:23.260
I love you, Tuka. I love you.

47:42.571 --> 47:43.572
Look!

47:50.579 --> 47:52.247
You old cupcaking ass.

47:54.291 --> 47:55.501
Shut up, big head.

48:03.300 --> 48:04.510
I miss this.

48:06.970 --> 48:08.180
Us.

48:14.937 --> 48:16.188
Really? Now?

48:16.271 --> 48:18.273
What is that?

48:19.441 --> 48:21.235
- But you just got here!
- Please, no!

48:21.318 --> 48:23.987
- No! Hold on!
- Hold me closer!

48:24.071 --> 48:25.781
No! I'm trying. I can't!

48:25.864 --> 48:27.282
Never forget how much I care!

48:27.366 --> 48:28.575
No, please.

48:28.659 --> 48:30.494
Tell yourself every day! Tell yourself!

48:30.577 --> 48:33.163
Shut up, Tuka, and hold on! Hold on!

48:33.247 --> 48:37.626
- I'm sorry.
- Hold on. Hold on.

48:44.007 --> 48:49.054
Tuka, please. Tuka. Tuka, please.

48:49.137 --> 48:56.103
Please come back. Please.
Please, Tuka. No, please.

49:07.447 --> 49:08.532
I need you to kiss me.

49:10.701 --> 49:11.785
Right now.

49:40.314 --> 49:41.315
Come on.

49:43.609 --> 49:46.486
Let's see if we can get enough ice
for that big-ass forehead.

50:04.421 --> 50:08.258
Still don't get why you spent all your
little savings on shoes for a dead dude.

50:10.636 --> 50:13.180
His name was DJ.

50:15.182 --> 50:17.017
He did something worthwhile.

50:17.726 --> 50:21.313
Changed lives. Mostly mine.

50:22.105 --> 50:24.733
You sound crazy. Changed your life?

50:24.816 --> 50:27.569
How, sway? He died years ago.

50:33.825 --> 50:35.285
It's a pretty good story.

50:36.328 --> 50:39.373
Be nice, I'll tell it to you sometime.

51:04.106 --> 51:05.691
Knees up! Knees up! Knees up! Knees up!

51:05.774 --> 51:07.919
Don't be juiced just 'cause,
for the first time in your life,

51:07.943 --> 51:09.152
you faster than me.

51:09.236 --> 51:11.876
Just because we kiss sometimes
don't mean I'm gonna go easy on you.

51:11.947 --> 51:14.658
I'm about to scrape you. I promise.

51:14.741 --> 51:16.869
Come on.

51:16.952 --> 51:19.663
Now you got me.

51:22.124 --> 51:23.750
Hey. Don't push me.
