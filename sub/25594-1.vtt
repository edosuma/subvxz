02:16.857 --> 02:20.245
<i>Lucas, it's Pyotr. You ready to get rich?</i>

02:20.325 --> 02:22.174
<i>You better be.</i>

02:22.954 --> 02:26.147
<i>There is one small thing
I will need to tell you.</i>

02:26.227 --> 02:28.271
<i>Or maybe not so small.</i>

02:28.551 --> 02:31.286
<i>Maybe quite big in fact.</i>

02:31.366 --> 02:32.793
<i>So hurry, please.</i>

02:32.873 --> 02:35.826
<i>St. Petersburg is not the same without you.</i>

02:35.906 --> 02:37.488
<i>Dasvidaniya.</i>

02:43.979 --> 02:46.123
Your jet's boarding in ten minutes.

02:46.203 --> 02:48.033
May I top you off?

03:31.431 --> 03:34.474
- Raisa.
- Good morning, Mr. Hill.

03:34.554 --> 03:37.557
- Always a pleasure. Are you well?
- Of course.

03:39.740 --> 03:42.966
Pyotr left. An hour ago.

03:43.846 --> 03:47.878
- Left, meaning?
- Men were here, asking about him.

03:47.958 --> 03:51.053
When I told him this, he grew agitated.

03:51.133 --> 03:53.160
He said you should meet him in Mirny.

03:53.240 --> 03:56.202
At the... Gorynch Guest House.

03:56.282 --> 03:58.180
Then, he left.

04:00.850 --> 04:02.878
Can you get me into his room?

04:29.616 --> 04:31.686
I'm at the hotel, Pyotr.

04:31.766 --> 04:35.154
Where we're supposed
to meet Volkov in exactly...

04:35.234 --> 04:39.262
...thirty-seven minutes, with a sample
of the blues, in case you've forgotten.

04:39.942 --> 04:42.409
I don't care what kind
of shit you've stepped in...

04:42.489 --> 04:45.916
...Boris Volkov isn't
a good man to disappoint.

04:48.051 --> 04:50.321
So, where's the sample, Pyotr?

04:51.301 --> 04:53.033
I know you.

04:53.113 --> 04:56.271
You've figured out some clever place...

04:56.351 --> 04:59.635
...some childish fucking trick.

05:00.215 --> 05:02.026
I need to know where.

05:03.606 --> 05:05.820
So, call me back please.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.544
Fucking Pyotr.

05:30.868 --> 05:34.498
Fifty... million... dollars.

05:35.256 --> 05:39.919
I can assure you, Mr. Hill,
it requires effort to gather this.

05:40.599 --> 05:42.800
I exerted myself.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.843
How do you imagine
I'm feeling now, sitting here...

05:46.923 --> 05:49.980
...learning I might've done this for nothing?

05:54.396 --> 05:57.875
Your responsibility
was to procure a sample...

05:57.955 --> 05:59.491
...no?

06:01.071 --> 06:02.929
A single diamond...

06:03.009 --> 06:06.025
...blue in color. It seems like such a...

06:06.105 --> 06:08.981
...simple thing. And yet?

06:37.565 --> 06:38.524
Huh?

07:02.198 --> 07:04.439
South Africans are in town.

07:05.119 --> 07:09.939
Vincent de Bruin and his band of cretins.

07:10.919 --> 07:12.943
I know nothing about that.

07:14.723 --> 07:16.751
I hope this is true.

07:17.131 --> 07:21.145
I'd hate to think they were
somehow involved in your...

07:21.225 --> 07:23.256
...unfortunate delay.

07:23.836 --> 07:26.650
If I can just draw on your patience...

07:29.721 --> 07:32.726
Patience, Mr. Hill...

07:36.380 --> 07:39.629
...is like air in a sealed room.

07:40.981 --> 07:43.423
No matter how much you start with...

07:45.085 --> 07:48.131
...eventually, you'll run out. Hm?

07:51.626 --> 07:53.587
I'll be back in two days.

07:53.667 --> 07:56.480
- With a sample?
- The whole allotment.

07:56.860 --> 07:58.952
Compensation for your...

08:00.796 --> 08:03.603
...regrettable tardiness, hm?

08:04.032 --> 08:06.689
Two percent. An even million.

08:14.971 --> 08:17.867
I'll see you in two days, Mr. Hill.

08:17.947 --> 08:19.569
Two days.

08:19.649 --> 08:21.501
Two days.

08:58.132 --> 09:01.927
I take off for Mirny in two hours.
You better be there.

09:02.007 --> 09:05.167
This is my new number.
Fucking call me, Pyotr.

10:18.502 --> 10:20.649
Mr. Hill, yes?

10:20.729 --> 10:23.289
Pyotr said his American friend
would be coming...

10:23.369 --> 10:26.773
...and that I should give you his room,
and ask you to wait for him.

10:30.980 --> 10:34.590
- Would you like me to escort you upstairs?
- No. Thank you.

10:38.192 --> 10:41.812
- Room three.
- Anywhere still open for a drink?

10:42.492 --> 10:45.258
Up the street. There's a cafe.

10:45.338 --> 10:48.094
But you need a warmer coat, I think.

10:49.824 --> 10:52.108
I packed for St. Petersburg.

10:52.188 --> 10:54.035
Then, you will be cold.

10:55.275 --> 10:58.689
That is for you, I believe.
A man called, twenty minutes ago.

11:00.297 --> 11:02.135
For the American.

11:09.902 --> 11:12.469
- Yes?
- I thought we were friends.

11:12.949 --> 11:15.064
I thought we had an understanding.

11:16.564 --> 11:19.093
We never had an understanding.

11:19.173 --> 11:21.008
<i>But we're still friends, right?</i>

11:21.488 --> 11:24.050
I'm friends with everyone, Vincent.
You know that.

11:24.130 --> 11:26.914
Yeah, you see, so quickly, we arrive
right at the heart of the problem...

11:26.994 --> 11:29.624
...you need to be more selective.
Because the friends that you have now...

11:29.704 --> 11:31.777
...they're cheating you.

11:33.139 --> 11:36.049
I want you to take whatever
that Boris Volkov has promised you...

11:36.129 --> 11:37.989
...I want you to add five percent.

11:38.069 --> 11:41.162
That's what my associates and I are willing
to offer. Can you picture that sum?

11:41.242 --> 11:45.109
Know what I'm picturing?
You and I, face down in the Neva...

11:45.189 --> 11:47.702
...side by side,
like the good friends we are.

11:47.782 --> 11:49.827
We guarantee safe passage, a private jet...

11:49.907 --> 11:52.735
...before anyone even realizes
you've left the country.

11:53.731 --> 11:56.082
<i>You have no idea what he's offering.</i>

11:56.162 --> 11:59.209
Would I even be calling
if that were the case?

12:00.967 --> 12:03.419
There's no need to say yes right now. Just...

12:03.499 --> 12:05.506
...just don't say no.

12:10.611 --> 12:12.122
Lucas?

13:45.967 --> 13:48.379
Can I get you something else?

13:50.153 --> 13:51.981
I'm good.

13:58.635 --> 14:00.209
Oh.

14:35.064 --> 14:36.624
Uh...

14:42.062 --> 14:43.155
Porsche?

14:56.881 --> 14:59.635
- Da? Da? Da! Da! Da!
- Hey! Hey!

15:00.315 --> 15:03.183
Da! Da! Da! Huh?

15:05.929 --> 15:07.476
Yefrem!

16:32.681 --> 16:35.755
What? You are worried
I've never seen a penis before?

16:40.920 --> 16:42.998
- I thought...
- They're laughing now.

16:43.078 --> 16:46.946
For three hours they drank here,
and then you... such a hero...

16:47.026 --> 16:49.464
...you threw them out before they had to pay.

17:03.369 --> 17:04.873
Americans...

17:05.353 --> 17:08.397
...you think money solves everything.

17:20.442 --> 17:22.281
Take the bottle.

17:22.862 --> 17:24.112
You paid for it.

18:53.470 --> 18:54.975
Hey.

18:55.755 --> 18:58.213
American, wake up. Hey!

20:16.061 --> 20:19.710
The least you can do is let me know
if you're okay, Pyotr.

20:19.790 --> 20:22.878
Just pick up the fucking phone and call me.

20:25.870 --> 20:27.934
What are you doing?

20:32.678 --> 20:34.297
- French toast.
- Mm-hmm.

20:34.378 --> 20:36.988
I know what it is. Why are you cooking it?

20:38.252 --> 20:41.507
A gesture of gratitude,
which I believe you're owed.

20:42.037 --> 20:44.665
Along with an apology, if I'm not mistaken.

20:46.095 --> 20:49.575
Do people apologize in America
for being stupid?

20:50.380 --> 20:52.317
Not often.

20:52.398 --> 20:54.881
But it's still considered good form.

20:56.461 --> 20:58.739
Well, then, I accept your apology.

21:04.100 --> 21:05.631
Come.

21:07.220 --> 21:08.812
Eat.

21:39.627 --> 21:42.039
Not much of a talker, are you?

21:46.590 --> 21:48.236
Who is Pyotr?

23:08.772 --> 23:10.288
Try.

23:16.393 --> 23:17.940
Mmm.

23:22.247 --> 23:24.713
- These are delicious.
- Mm-hmm.

23:25.092 --> 23:26.558
My brother's wife.

23:26.638 --> 23:29.883
She is not good for much,
but she is good for this.

23:49.570 --> 23:53.111
What would you do
if I asked you to sleep with me?

23:59.549 --> 24:00.980
Now?

24:01.560 --> 24:02.994
Mm-hmm.

24:05.207 --> 24:07.054
I'd say...

24:11.205 --> 24:14.218
...with the most possible regret...

24:16.336 --> 24:19.025
...that I need to go find someone...

24:20.105 --> 24:23.611
- ...that it's very urgent.
- Your mysterious Pyotr?

24:23.691 --> 24:26.809
His brother, Andrei.

24:32.308 --> 24:34.116
Are you asking?

24:36.604 --> 24:38.787
He thinks it's something
that has already happened...

24:38.867 --> 24:42.193
...which means everyone else
will soon think this, too. So...

24:42.273 --> 24:44.147
...why shouldn't I make it so?

24:45.086 --> 24:48.048
That's not the best come-on I've ever heard.

24:49.599 --> 24:52.614
- Where's your friend's brother?
- At the mine.

24:52.694 --> 24:55.761
I want to catch him
when he comes off his shift.

24:56.341 --> 24:58.159
I will take you.

24:58.739 --> 25:01.828
And then, if we still
don't hate each other...

25:02.308 --> 25:04.178
...we come back here.

25:04.558 --> 25:06.333
Agreed?

25:07.543 --> 25:09.574
You're very forward.

25:09.654 --> 25:11.271
You find this unappealing?

25:12.783 --> 25:15.312
Quite the contrary.

25:47.501 --> 25:50.907
For God's sake. Not here. Follow in your car.

25:54.269 --> 25:56.142
He flew in yesterday.

25:58.751 --> 26:01.177
Then left again immediately.

26:01.657 --> 26:03.310
Because?

26:03.390 --> 26:07.089
Samsonov's men.
They were here, looking for him.

26:07.869 --> 26:09.878
Who the fuck is Samsonov?

26:10.458 --> 26:12.349
Pyotr didn't tell you?

26:14.193 --> 26:16.005
A bad man.

26:18.240 --> 26:21.443
Smuggling, drugs, prostitution.

26:21.944 --> 26:24.227
He and his men...

26:24.307 --> 26:27.630
...they are former Spetsnaz members.

26:27.710 --> 26:30.651
You know Spetsnaz? Special forces?

26:31.131 --> 26:33.532
Why are they looking for Pyotr?

26:33.612 --> 26:37.762
Pyotr sold Samsonov
some diamonds, blue diamonds.

26:37.842 --> 26:39.854
My diamonds?

26:39.934 --> 26:41.486
Fakes.

26:43.491 --> 26:45.879
The fuck are you talking about?

26:45.959 --> 26:49.292
He thought it was good way
to double the money.

26:49.372 --> 26:51.942
Samsonov wouldn't know they weren't real.

26:53.422 --> 26:55.281
They were treated.

26:56.261 --> 26:59.728
- It's interesting. You take diamonds...
- I know what treated means, Andrei.

26:59.808 --> 27:01.595
Not like this.

27:01.675 --> 27:04.767
Very high quality. New technique.

27:08.655 --> 27:12.499
Anyways, here is my number. It is secure.

27:16.181 --> 27:18.054
A friend of your wife?

27:19.956 --> 27:22.232
That supposed to mean something?

27:41.634 --> 27:43.986
- <i>Hello.</i>
- It's Lucas Hill.

27:44.066 --> 27:46.660
- How soon can we be airborne?
- <i>Good morning Mr. Hill.</i>

27:46.740 --> 27:50.043
<i>No flying today, nor tomorrow.
Maybe, God willing, day after.</i>

27:50.123 --> 27:52.789
I don't have time to play this.
Just tell me who I need to pay.

27:52.869 --> 27:55.427
- <i>Who controls the weather?</i>
- What?

27:55.507 --> 27:58.947
<i>You want to fly today?
Find the man who controls the weather.</i>

27:59.327 --> 28:01.395
<i>That's who you need to pay.</i>

28:03.075 --> 28:04.901
What's wrong with the weather?

28:04.981 --> 28:07.351
<i>In Mirny, there is very little
that is not wrong.</i>

28:30.242 --> 28:33.248
I do not need to know what that was about.

28:33.928 --> 28:36.994
But if you are some sort of spy,
I will not be happy.

28:39.164 --> 28:40.725
I'm not a spy.

28:58.283 --> 29:01.371
So, how you say in English?

29:01.751 --> 29:03.783
Good news, bad news?

29:04.463 --> 29:06.489
Which do you want first?

29:07.224 --> 29:09.670
I've had enough bad for the moment.

29:10.490 --> 29:12.352
Give me the good.

29:13.032 --> 29:15.423
I do not hate you yet.

29:18.693 --> 29:20.523
And the bad?

29:21.597 --> 29:24.303
Your not-spying took too much time.

29:24.383 --> 29:26.356
I need to go open the cafe.

29:33.827 --> 29:35.922
You're not disappointed?

29:46.026 --> 29:47.898
Of course I'm disappointed.

30:06.251 --> 30:08.229
How long this time?

30:08.309 --> 30:10.751
There and back, if I'm lucky.

30:11.460 --> 30:14.422
Well, play nice with those poor Muscovites.

30:14.502 --> 30:16.572
It's St. Petersburg this time.

30:16.652 --> 30:19.882
And you know me... I always play nice.

32:27.130 --> 32:28.681
Hmm?

34:10.295 --> 34:12.101
The sink.

34:14.429 --> 34:16.270
The toilet.

34:16.908 --> 34:18.150
And...

34:18.960 --> 34:20.839
...the bed...

34:21.518 --> 34:24.011
...which is either
surprisingly comfortable...

34:24.291 --> 34:26.730
...or I'm just really fucking tired.

34:29.065 --> 34:30.929
A lamp.

34:32.081 --> 34:33.929
A candle.

34:35.010 --> 34:37.659
Apparently, they lack confidence
in their power supply.

34:37.739 --> 34:41.239
<i>Well, you better hope not, 'cause
if the lights go out, so does the heat.</i>

34:43.963 --> 34:46.007
<i>I think you'd like it here.</i>

34:47.487 --> 34:48.911
I'm going bear hunting.

34:49.911 --> 34:51.681
<i>Have you been drinking?</i>

34:51.761 --> 34:53.440
Copiously.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.563
<i>All work and no play, huh?</i>

34:55.643 --> 34:57.448
I'm trapped.

34:59.922 --> 35:02.044
Wanna see an old telephone?

35:02.124 --> 35:04.804
<i>Send me a pic, okay? Let's talk later?</i>

35:38.757 --> 35:40.765
You're not a good man.

35:56.725 --> 35:58.021
What is that?

36:00.618 --> 36:02.480
A gift.

36:02.898 --> 36:05.191
In case you've decided to hate me.

36:06.171 --> 36:08.009
To change your mind.

36:10.384 --> 36:12.237
A candle?

36:13.417 --> 36:15.292
It's the thought that counts.

36:16.172 --> 36:18.185
That's what we say in America.

36:22.322 --> 36:24.212
Do you?

36:26.560 --> 36:28.146
What?

36:30.535 --> 36:32.390
Hate me?

41:39.294 --> 41:42.575
- <i>Mr. Hill.</i>
- How's the weather?

41:42.655 --> 41:44.342
<i>Better.</i>

41:44.422 --> 41:47.314
So, today? Tonight?

41:48.539 --> 41:51.141
- Tomorrow?
- <i>Maybe tomorrow.</i>

41:51.221 --> 41:53.118
I'll see you at 11.

42:09.687 --> 42:12.331
I'm flying back to St. Petersburg tomorrow.

42:12.411 --> 42:14.412
You better fucking be there.

42:14.954 --> 42:17.797
This is my new number. Call me.

44:42.504 --> 44:45.658
In Russia, we have
these things we drink from.

44:45.738 --> 44:47.572
We call them glasses.

44:54.325 --> 44:56.206
Your parents?

44:58.137 --> 45:00.064
My father Sasha...

45:00.144 --> 45:02.375
...mama Nina, Ivan...

45:02.455 --> 45:05.334
...Maxim, my older sister Olga.

45:05.814 --> 45:07.823
Vladimir wasn't born yet.

45:12.556 --> 45:15.195
- This?
- That's in Australia.

45:17.509 --> 45:20.392
My sister Olga, and this is her husband.

45:21.121 --> 45:23.787
They run a travel agency in Brisbane.

45:24.132 --> 45:27.542
I worked for them.
That's how I learned English.

45:28.962 --> 45:30.781
And then?

45:31.361 --> 45:33.284
And then...

45:33.364 --> 45:35.247
...my mother died.

45:35.627 --> 45:37.579
A stroke.

45:37.659 --> 45:40.305
Four weeks later, my father followed.

45:41.285 --> 45:44.471
Someone had to run the café, so I came back.

45:45.036 --> 45:47.063
But what about your brothers?

45:48.443 --> 45:51.645
My father would've set fire
to the place first.

45:51.725 --> 45:54.198
Same outcome, only quicker.

45:56.595 --> 45:58.207
Come.

46:06.849 --> 46:09.460
You could stay here longer if you wanted.

46:10.940 --> 46:12.893
I'm not asking you to.

46:12.973 --> 46:15.451
I'm just saying I would not object.

46:18.326 --> 46:20.793
I have a situation in St. Petersburg.

46:21.673 --> 46:23.515
I need to address it.

46:25.353 --> 46:28.226
Pyotr and your not-spying?

46:30.886 --> 46:33.111
You are in some sort of trouble, I think.

46:37.876 --> 46:39.356
In Russia...

46:39.436 --> 46:43.883
...if we don't want to answer
a question, we just ask one in return.

46:47.412 --> 46:51.229
Is... is it true what they say about Anton?

46:53.120 --> 46:55.179
What do they say about him?

46:56.126 --> 46:57.954
That he's a good man.

46:59.946 --> 47:01.788
Is your wife a good woman?

47:03.241 --> 47:05.078
Very much so.

47:06.705 --> 47:08.410
And yet, here you are.

47:10.156 --> 47:12.009
That's true.

47:12.089 --> 47:13.987
Here I am.

47:15.714 --> 47:18.544
You don't think this requires an explanation?

47:23.748 --> 47:26.190
My wife and I are old friends.

47:27.565 --> 47:29.778
And sometimes, with an old friend...

47:29.858 --> 47:32.527
...you learn to squint away certain things...

47:33.153 --> 47:36.602
...things you'd maybe rather not see.

47:39.464 --> 47:44.148
Is it just her doing
this not-seeing or you too?

47:46.240 --> 47:48.280
The thing about squinting...

47:48.560 --> 47:51.564
...you can never be certain
what you might not be seeing.

47:59.775 --> 48:01.635
My...

48:02.324 --> 48:04.677
...grandfather was in the Gulag.

48:05.876 --> 48:08.912
- You know about the Gulag?
- Of course.

48:10.021 --> 48:14.097
He always said there were
two types of prisoners.

48:15.477 --> 48:19.227
Some of them, you put them in a wooden hut...

48:19.307 --> 48:21.190
...and you give them a flint...

48:21.270 --> 48:24.542
...and they'll use the flint
to try and light the stove...

48:24.622 --> 48:28.195
...and they'll pass years like that.
Night after night...

48:28.275 --> 48:30.878
...striking the flint...

48:30.958 --> 48:33.403
...trying only to keep from shivering.

48:35.051 --> 48:36.900
The others?

48:37.617 --> 48:39.703
You give them a flint...

48:40.838 --> 48:42.881
...and they'll burn the hut down.

48:46.370 --> 48:48.589
You're saying my wife and I...

48:49.410 --> 48:51.160
...we light the stove.

48:53.651 --> 48:55.501
Do you?

49:00.595 --> 49:02.835
I'm so sorry for the bird.

49:04.865 --> 49:06.888
Where did you hear that?

49:06.968 --> 49:09.025
Your brothers.

49:55.482 --> 49:59.216
- Oh. Back so soon, Mr. Hill?
- Has Pyotr surfaced?

50:00.126 --> 50:04.056
But... a Mr. Volkov has been calling...

50:04.136 --> 50:06.137
...three, four times a day.

51:33.099 --> 51:36.808
If I send a plane,
will you come to St. Petersburg?

51:36.888 --> 51:39.358
<i>Do you imagine I'll say no to such a thing?</i>

51:39.438 --> 51:42.156
It'll be at the airport tomorrow,
before dawn.

51:42.236 --> 51:44.258
Is that too early?

51:44.338 --> 51:46.204
<i>Of course not.</i>

51:46.284 --> 51:49.516
- I need a favor.
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

51:49.596 --> 51:52.553
I see. Nothing comes for free.

51:52.633 --> 51:54.588
The candle I gave you...

51:54.668 --> 51:56.701
...I need you to bring it.

51:57.281 --> 52:00.060
This isn't supposed to seem odd?

52:00.140 --> 52:03.424
I'll explain when you get here, I promise.

52:04.045 --> 52:08.248
So it is the candle you want
and I am merely the one who brings it?

52:08.528 --> 52:10.088
<i>Exactly.</i>

52:13.215 --> 52:16.455
This is humor. American humor?

52:18.595 --> 52:20.476
I'm sorry.

52:21.772 --> 52:24.333
Come to St. Petersburg, Katya.

52:24.413 --> 52:28.194
I assure you,
you'll see how much you're wanted.

52:30.855 --> 52:32.386
<i>Okay?</i>

52:33.566 --> 52:35.104
Okay.

53:08.636 --> 53:11.012
<i>You're cutting this close, Mr. Hill.</i>

53:11.612 --> 53:15.000
The air in the room... it's almost gone.

53:17.497 --> 53:21.186
I need more time. But I have the sample.

53:21.266 --> 53:24.387
<i>If you have a sample,
I do believe you have everything.</i>

53:24.467 --> 53:27.453
Unless you were having other conversations...

53:27.533 --> 53:29.827
...with other parties.

53:30.162 --> 53:32.609
<i>South Africans, for example.</i>

53:34.005 --> 53:36.580
Let me take you out tomorrow night...

53:36.660 --> 53:38.739
...you and your associates.

53:40.019 --> 53:41.923
A gesture of good faith.

53:42.003 --> 53:43.570
Nonsense.

53:44.450 --> 53:46.751
This is my city, and you are my guest.

53:46.831 --> 53:48.714
You'll bring the sample.

53:49.294 --> 53:52.670
Of course. 8 pm. You name the spot.

53:52.750 --> 53:55.576
Ten, Mr. Hill.

53:55.656 --> 53:58.053
This is St. Petersburg.

53:58.133 --> 54:01.428
Nothing of any use happens before ten.

54:02.485 --> 54:05.988
Rubinshteina Street, 151.

54:07.291 --> 54:09.120
<i>I'll see you there?</i>

54:32.845 --> 54:34.795
- Hello?
- Lucas, my friend...

54:34.875 --> 54:39.743
- ...you are just too easy to find.
- Vincent. How can I help you?

54:39.823 --> 54:43.917
Tell your man to drive to the Lion's Bridge
tomorrow at 9 am. We'll talk then.

55:10.418 --> 55:13.172
I apologize for this unfortunate
bit of drama, Lucas.

55:13.252 --> 55:15.649
Sometimes it's better to meet face to face.

55:16.059 --> 55:18.427
You've watched too many spy films, Vincent.

55:18.507 --> 55:21.504
On the contrary. You've watched too few.

55:21.584 --> 55:24.178
Tell me you're not carrying a smartphone,
'cause even a thug like Volkov...

55:24.258 --> 55:26.324
...can track your GPS with that thing.

55:29.407 --> 55:31.236
To what do I owe this pleasure?

55:32.596 --> 55:36.664
- I would like to repay a debt.
- And what debt would that be?

55:36.744 --> 55:38.377
Lagos.

55:39.696 --> 55:41.792
There was no reason for you
to contact me that evening.

55:41.872 --> 55:45.154
It was an act of generosity
some might argue saved my life.

55:46.132 --> 55:48.588
Now, there's no reason for me to contact you.

55:50.415 --> 55:52.248
Keep going.

56:18.473 --> 56:21.799
Fuck, Lucas, you hold everything
at a distance. You see it as a strength...

56:21.879 --> 56:23.961
...but it can also be a weakness.

56:24.899 --> 56:27.194
I'm telling you, feel this.

56:27.874 --> 56:30.476
Go home, now...

56:31.256 --> 56:33.051
...before it's too late.

56:44.456 --> 56:46.840
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Is he fucking me over?

56:46.920 --> 56:49.494
- <i>Who?</i>
- Your brother has vanished with my diamonds.

56:49.574 --> 56:52.092
Tell me why I shouldn't think
he's fucking me over.

56:52.172 --> 56:54.408
<i>Because he's Pyotr.</i>

56:55.088 --> 56:58.546
The FSB is involved. Warn him if he calls.

57:51.109 --> 57:52.677
Fuck.

58:08.348 --> 58:10.238
Can I see?

58:18.289 --> 58:21.692
- It's not real?
- The best I've ever seen...

58:22.915 --> 58:24.650
...but no...

58:25.345 --> 58:27.231
...not real.

58:30.779 --> 58:33.268
And this is a problem, I assume?

58:34.648 --> 58:36.365
One of many.

58:42.815 --> 58:44.670
The same?

58:45.272 --> 58:46.890
Real.

58:46.970 --> 58:51.315
I've promised someone a dozen
and I only have one...

58:51.395 --> 58:53.651
...which is another of my problems.

58:57.932 --> 59:00.028
Tell me about the gun, please.

59:00.508 --> 59:03.526
- It's Pyotr's.
- You found him?

59:11.081 --> 59:13.328
Is that all you have to say?

59:39.836 --> 59:42.101
Does your wife know you do this?

59:43.756 --> 59:45.149
Yes.

59:47.210 --> 59:49.659
What does she think about it?

59:50.868 --> 59:52.712
She's used to it.

01:00:08.512 --> 01:00:11.575
This scent,
what's the word for it in English?

01:00:16.073 --> 01:00:18.674
- Jasmine.
- Jasmine.

01:00:24.528 --> 01:00:26.777
You should bring home some of them...

01:00:27.157 --> 01:00:29.025
...for your wife.

01:00:30.999 --> 01:00:33.170
Do you bring her gifts...

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:35.681
...when you return from your travels?

01:00:35.761 --> 01:00:37.575
Not so much.

01:00:38.155 --> 01:00:39.694
Why?

01:00:40.674 --> 01:00:42.749
Do you think you're the gift?

01:00:43.229 --> 01:00:45.877
That she should be so happy to see you home?

01:00:53.047 --> 01:00:54.975
If you love someone...

01:00:55.055 --> 01:00:57.897
...when you go away,
you should bring them something.

01:00:59.443 --> 01:01:01.261
To show you carry them with you.

01:01:03.088 --> 01:01:06.166
You're a grown man.
I should not need to tell you this.

01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:16.491
I want you to do something for me.

01:01:17.271 --> 01:01:18.487
Anything.

01:01:19.936 --> 01:01:21.818
Fuck me.

01:01:22.225 --> 01:01:24.112
Right now.

01:01:24.692 --> 01:01:26.754
Like you fuck your wife.

01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:36.675
Tell me you love me.

01:01:38.632 --> 01:01:41.855
- I love you, Gabby.
- I love you, too.

01:01:49.691 --> 01:01:51.858
- Hey.
- Don't stop.

01:01:51.938 --> 01:01:54.376
Don't stop. Keep fucking her.

01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:59.263
I want you to say her name when you come.

01:02:00.811 --> 01:02:02.666
Say it.

01:02:11.757 --> 01:02:13.338
Gabby.

01:02:14.947 --> 01:02:16.490
Gabby.

01:02:40.681 --> 01:02:42.567
How old are you?

01:02:44.672 --> 01:02:46.497
51.

01:02:49.316 --> 01:02:51.166
All those years...

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:55.653
...and you still haven't learned how to
embrace someone at a moment like this?

01:03:04.214 --> 01:03:06.061
I'm sorry, Katya.

01:03:17.923 --> 01:03:19.983
Your blue diamonds...

01:03:21.592 --> 01:03:23.826
...do they never lose their color?

01:03:27.367 --> 01:03:29.832
"Diamond" comes from a Greek word.

01:03:31.197 --> 01:03:32.774
<i>Adamas.</i>

01:03:34.374 --> 01:03:36.439
It means "unalterable."

01:03:39.035 --> 01:03:41.238
Is that why you love them?

01:03:45.398 --> 01:03:47.833
I love them because they're beautiful...

01:03:49.302 --> 01:03:51.172
...and rare...

01:03:51.852 --> 01:03:53.860
...and tough.

01:04:32.471 --> 01:04:34.669
Not much of a talker, are you?

01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:39.062
I need to go out for a couple of hours.

01:04:39.839 --> 01:04:41.859
Will you be okay?

01:04:42.716 --> 01:04:46.209
But you flew me all the way out here
to sit alone in your hotel room?

01:04:46.289 --> 01:04:48.441
I need to go appease a man.

01:04:50.289 --> 01:04:54.543
The man who is expecting the dozen
diamonds but only receiving one.

01:04:58.732 --> 01:05:00.448
Where?

01:05:04.477 --> 01:05:06.955
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

01:05:50.049 --> 01:05:51.922
Lucas Hill.

01:06:13.812 --> 01:06:15.302
Hey.

01:06:23.574 --> 01:06:25.477
Now we can begin.

01:06:25.557 --> 01:06:29.180
Have you brought my blue beauty,
this thing of wonder?

01:06:33.892 --> 01:06:35.375
Thank you.

01:06:35.455 --> 01:06:36.950
Welcome.

01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:40.113
Come on in. Let's do business.

01:07:06.369 --> 01:07:08.654
The rest is just as lovely?

01:07:14.785 --> 01:07:17.151
Then we will be friends for life.

01:07:24.261 --> 01:07:26.758
Is that your lovely friend?

01:07:27.838 --> 01:07:29.155
It is.

01:08:00.236 --> 01:08:02.073
To life.

01:08:19.122 --> 01:08:20.725
To life.

01:08:20.805 --> 01:08:22.733
I like this girl.

01:08:23.563 --> 01:08:27.408
Come. Come, man. To life, huh?

01:08:34.857 --> 01:08:36.434
Opa.

01:08:43.203 --> 01:08:45.099
In America...

01:08:46.337 --> 01:08:49.509
...you swear loyalty by becoming...

01:08:49.589 --> 01:08:51.590
...blood brothers, yes?

01:08:56.595 --> 01:08:58.796
Would you like to become my...

01:09:00.857 --> 01:09:02.689
...my brother?

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:10.533
Here's what I'd like to do.

01:09:13.117 --> 01:09:15.381
My lovely friend here?

01:09:15.886 --> 01:09:18.917
I tell her to suck you off.

01:09:19.897 --> 01:09:23.942
And at the same time, you tell your
lovely friend to suck me off.

01:09:24.022 --> 01:09:27.261
We sit, staring at each other...

01:09:27.341 --> 01:09:29.947
...until we come. After that...

01:09:30.577 --> 01:09:33.580
...nothing can separate us.

01:09:35.548 --> 01:09:37.112
Huh?

01:09:45.962 --> 01:09:47.981
I'm touched by your gesture.

01:09:48.761 --> 01:09:50.856
But this is something, um...

01:09:52.926 --> 01:09:55.645
...it's not how we do things in America.

01:09:57.988 --> 01:10:00.591
Thank God we're in Russia, man.

01:10:01.395 --> 01:10:02.948
Opa!

01:10:05.835 --> 01:10:07.355
What?

01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:12.029
She's, uh...

01:10:14.086 --> 01:10:16.578
...not good enough for you?

01:10:16.658 --> 01:10:19.462
Quite the contrary. You have excellent taste.

01:10:22.752 --> 01:10:24.635
Then what is it?

01:10:25.424 --> 01:10:29.638
Your woman's mouth is too pretty for my cock?

01:10:33.401 --> 01:10:35.524
Not at all. I just think...

01:10:36.204 --> 01:10:39.661
...Boris, Boris.

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:55.081
- Lena?
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:45.563 --> 01:11:48.583
Tell me to suck his cock.

01:11:56.733 --> 01:11:58.336
I think it's...

01:11:58.416 --> 01:12:01.192
...better if we leave here as brothers.

01:12:01.272 --> 01:12:03.287
Because if we're not brothers...

01:12:05.067 --> 01:12:07.483
...maybe we're not friends, either.

01:12:18.924 --> 01:12:20.687
Do it.

01:14:20.119 --> 01:14:21.878
Messages?

01:14:23.788 --> 01:14:25.879
Your room number, sir?

01:14:28.654 --> 01:14:30.492
701.

01:14:39.221 --> 01:14:41.004
They're upstairs.

01:14:48.386 --> 01:14:50.258
Thank you.

01:15:30.450 --> 01:15:32.932
Polozin, FSB.

01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:48.547
I'm going to be direct.

01:15:50.262 --> 01:15:52.670
I hope you'll respond in kind.

01:15:54.461 --> 01:15:56.967
The FSB has no interest in you, Mr. Hill.

01:15:57.047 --> 01:16:00.652
In fact, we'd like to see you leave
the country as soon as possible.

01:16:01.481 --> 01:16:06.096
But first, we hope you will
provide a small service.

01:16:08.171 --> 01:16:09.637
What kind of service?

01:16:10.827 --> 01:16:14.811
We recently took a man named
Yuri Samsonov into custody.

01:16:14.891 --> 01:16:19.956
Mr. Samsonov had in his possession
a number of quite beautiful blue diamonds.

01:16:20.836 --> 01:16:23.657
Beautiful but worthless, as it turned out.

01:16:25.014 --> 01:16:27.780
Perhaps you're not so surprised to hear this.

01:16:29.305 --> 01:16:31.971
I'd like to speak with my embassy,
if you don't mind.

01:16:40.864 --> 01:16:42.939
We should keep talking, no?

01:16:43.219 --> 01:16:46.398
Someone, apparently,
has taken it into his head...

01:16:46.478 --> 01:16:49.154
...to inconvenience Mr. Volkov.

01:16:50.134 --> 01:16:53.389
My job is to be the inconvenience.

01:16:53.969 --> 01:16:58.423
But to accomplish this,
unfortunately I need your assistance.

01:16:58.612 --> 01:17:02.088
It would be helpful to us
if you would vouch for the quality...

01:17:02.168 --> 01:17:05.416
...of poor Mr. Samsonov's fake diamonds.

01:17:07.678 --> 01:17:08.672
Meaning?

01:17:10.112 --> 01:17:15.556
What do you suppose might happen if someone
with your unquestionable expertise...

01:17:15.636 --> 01:17:18.533
...were to convince Mr. Boris Volkov...

01:17:18.613 --> 01:17:21.014
...to buy these diamonds of ours?

01:17:25.522 --> 01:17:28.430
You know what would happen
to me if I do this.

01:17:31.273 --> 01:17:34.128
Mr. Volkov would be rather unhappy.

01:17:35.571 --> 01:17:37.749
Which would give me what?

01:17:37.829 --> 01:17:40.674
- A day?
- Two, maybe three.

01:17:40.954 --> 01:17:43.227
Enough time to leave the country.

01:17:49.359 --> 01:17:53.533
I assume you have a reason
why I shouldn't tell you to fuck off.

01:17:54.367 --> 01:17:57.508
- Indeed.
- Now might be the time to share it.

01:17:57.588 --> 01:18:00.242
When you tell us to fuck off...

01:18:00.322 --> 01:18:02.808
...what do you think happens to her?

01:18:10.109 --> 01:18:11.612
Ah.

01:18:12.873 --> 01:18:15.098
Perhaps you don't care.

01:18:22.044 --> 01:18:23.881
Mr. Hill?

01:19:21.306 --> 01:19:23.560
How much did Samsonov pay?

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:25.555
40 million.

01:19:26.535 --> 01:19:29.147
Your partner, he's quite the salesman.

01:19:29.415 --> 01:19:31.677
I'm hoping you're as skilled.

01:19:32.757 --> 01:19:34.758
Here's a transmitter.

01:19:34.838 --> 01:19:38.519
Not that we don't trust you, of course.
Your lapel, please.

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.241
Thank you.

01:19:43.321 --> 01:19:44.865
Good.

01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:47.152
Say something.

01:19:47.808 --> 01:19:49.649
Fuck off.

01:19:52.609 --> 01:19:55.087
Okay, and this...

01:19:55.167 --> 01:19:57.568
...is for the wire transfer.

01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:02.493
He'll be bringing his appraiser with him.
Will that be a problem for you?

01:20:03.362 --> 01:20:05.953
Depends on whether he comes
with a spectrometer.

01:20:06.773 --> 01:20:09.959
- Did he bring it last time?
- I didn't see one.

01:20:10.039 --> 01:20:12.616
Then it should not be a problem.

01:20:14.808 --> 01:20:16.612
Thank you, Mr. Hill.

01:21:06.904 --> 01:21:08.498
Please.

01:21:19.342 --> 01:21:22.039
Just a quick kick of the tires, that's all.

01:21:22.119 --> 01:21:23.994
Of course.

01:21:27.329 --> 01:21:30.102
You know what happens if something is wrong?

01:21:32.530 --> 01:21:35.441
You and I, we go for a walk together.

01:21:36.511 --> 01:21:37.863
What's his problem?

01:21:37.943 --> 01:21:40.479
Pavel, shut the fuck up.

01:21:40.559 --> 01:21:42.592
My apology, brother.

01:21:53.624 --> 01:21:57.270
In America, it's a weighty term.

01:21:58.129 --> 01:22:00.878
Don't be like that. Please.

01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:02.800
Let's have a drink, kid.

01:22:08.674 --> 01:22:11.286
- Please.
- I don't have time.

01:22:11.366 --> 01:22:14.018
- I have a flight to catch.
- Brother...

01:22:14.898 --> 01:22:18.388
...Lucas, look at me. Huh?

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:25.206
No.

01:22:27.837 --> 01:22:29.388
No.

01:22:40.315 --> 01:22:43.800
These diamonds are good?

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:47.289
As good as you'll ever see, Boris.

01:23:02.989 --> 01:23:04.723
The account?

01:23:44.944 --> 01:23:46.374
Done?

01:23:55.285 --> 01:23:56.800
Done.

01:24:00.756 --> 01:24:03.157
You should have been an actor, Mr. Hill.

01:24:03.507 --> 01:24:05.584
We're sending you home.

01:24:57.508 --> 01:25:00.890
- I need a favor, Vincent.
- Ah, you see? We are friends.

01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:06.363
You contact Boris Volkov.
You offer him $65 million for the blues...

01:25:06.443 --> 01:25:09.492
...then make excuses
to delay the transaction.

01:25:09.572 --> 01:25:12.330
Fuck that. I'm not paying
that savage 65 million anything.

01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:15.477
I didn't say "pay."
I said, "offer and delay."

01:25:15.557 --> 01:25:17.931
24 hours, and you can stop
answering his calls.

01:25:18.011 --> 01:25:20.646
<i>I'll wire you $100K for your trouble.</i>

01:25:22.464 --> 01:25:26.294
Listen. If the goal is to cause Volkov
difficulty and to buy you time...

01:25:26.374 --> 01:25:29.111
...I'll do it now, I'll do it for free.

01:25:29.191 --> 01:25:30.857
Thank you, Vincent.

01:25:30.937 --> 01:25:33.928
You are a terrible man,
but an excellent friend.

01:25:34.697 --> 01:25:37.154
I imagine you know this already,
but if you've ripped this man off...

01:25:37.234 --> 01:25:39.435
...he will kill you on principle.

01:26:18.489 --> 01:26:20.803
<i>You've reached
the voicemail of Gabby Hill.</i>

01:26:20.883 --> 01:26:23.703
<i>After the beep, leave me a message. Thanks.</i>

01:28:21.581 --> 01:28:23.393
Hate me yet?

01:29:24.401 --> 01:29:26.300
I'll be right back.

01:30:46.217 --> 01:30:48.064
Fucking Pyotr.

01:33:49.722 --> 01:33:51.595
Lucas, are you okay?

01:34:02.605 --> 01:34:04.376
I just talked to Andrei...

01:34:05.176 --> 01:34:07.204
...the man from the mine.

01:34:08.084 --> 01:34:10.581
- Pyotr's brother?
- Yeah.

01:34:10.661 --> 01:34:13.413
Pyotr, he's coming back here.

01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:17.191
With the diamonds?

01:34:17.735 --> 01:34:19.452
Yeah.

01:34:19.532 --> 01:34:22.334
- I'll stay with you.
- No, it's okay.

01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:25.039
I'll see you later at home.

01:34:26.549 --> 01:34:30.216
Tomorrow morning,
I'll be making you French toast.

01:34:31.294 --> 01:34:33.110
And you'll be fine?

01:34:36.321 --> 01:34:37.859
Yes.

01:34:58.487 --> 01:35:02.488
Then I'll see you and your diamonds
and my breakfast in the morning.

01:35:12.448 --> 01:35:14.290
Good luck.
