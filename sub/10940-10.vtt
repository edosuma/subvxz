<i>Previously on "Heartland"...</i>

00:02.869 --> 00:04.928
Something tells me
you've done this before.

00:05.038 --> 00:05.936
Once or twice.

00:06.039 --> 00:08.974
Your dad's a legend on the circuit.

00:09.075 --> 00:11.134
If you want to bring up
your participation mark,

00:11.244 --> 00:12.404
I suggest you be there.

00:12.512 --> 00:13.240
Okay.

00:13.346 --> 00:14.711
Oh, Miss Adams?

00:14.848 --> 00:15.906
I'm sorry, I can't.

00:16.015 --> 00:18.780
You're not doing yourself
any favors, are you, Amy?

00:18.885 --> 00:20.045
What are you getting
worked up about?

00:20.153 --> 00:21.211
What happened to being reliable?

00:21.321 --> 00:22.879
What happened
to "leave things to me"?

00:27.060 --> 00:29.028
Is there still something
going on between you and Ty?

00:29.129 --> 00:30.892
No, nothing's going on.

00:30.997 --> 00:32.555
Nothing at all.

00:32.698 --> 00:33.563
What do you want from me?

00:33.666 --> 00:35.031
You move in next door,

00:35.135 --> 00:37.228
and you still have no clue
what's going on in my life.

00:37.337 --> 00:39.430
Maybe this isn't about a ride.
Maybe it's about catching up.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.200
Yeah, I'll take the bus.

00:41.307 --> 00:42.774
Look, this isn't the Wild West.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.367
If you see something, give us a call.

00:45.512 --> 00:47.480
Don't get between a rustler
and your livestock.

00:48.615 --> 00:49.411
Oh, man.

00:53.820 --> 00:54.752
Dad!

00:54.854 --> 00:56.412
Amy! No!

01:26.386 --> 01:29.253
People have been
pretty darn thoughtful.

01:29.355 --> 01:30.379
And generous.

01:30.490 --> 01:32.617
We have enough food
to last for weeks.

01:32.725 --> 01:34.716
Have you seen Amy this morning?

01:34.828 --> 01:36.159
I think she went for a ride.

01:36.262 --> 01:38.753
Good. That's good.

01:41.067 --> 01:45.401
Well, I'm just glad Mallory's not here
to go through this,

01:45.505 --> 01:49.373
although she did try to use it
as an excuse to get out of school.

01:49.876 --> 01:52.777
I don't know.
It just happened so fast and...

01:52.879 --> 01:54.403
That could have been you.

01:54.514 --> 01:56.675
Yeah, well, it wasrt.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.182
Come here.

01:59.185 --> 02:00.550
It's okay.

02:05.158 --> 02:06.989
Hey, buddy.

02:11.097 --> 02:12.826
What, are you not working?

02:12.966 --> 02:14.900
Un-un.

02:18.171 --> 02:19.035
Hey.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.504
Hey.

02:20.607 --> 02:22.837
You want me to cool him off
and groom him for you?

02:22.942 --> 02:24.102
Sure.

02:26.579 --> 02:27.511
Are you okay?

02:27.647 --> 02:29.114
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.585
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:43.796 --> 02:45.354
- It's Amy, right?
- Yeah.

02:45.465 --> 02:48.195
It's Callie. Callie Phillips.
We met at the cattle drive.

02:48.301 --> 02:49.928
Right.

02:50.036 --> 02:51.196
I'm a friend of your dad's.

02:52.071 --> 02:53.060
You want to go inside?

02:53.173 --> 02:55.038
Sure.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.303
Callie Phillips.

02:57.410 --> 02:59.503
Jack. Hi.

02:59.612 --> 03:01.580
Oh, it's so good to see you.

03:02.782 --> 03:04.340
I just drove from Calgary.

03:04.484 --> 03:05.974
I hope you don't mind me
dropping by.

03:06.085 --> 03:07.609
No, not at all.

03:07.787 --> 03:09.482
Appreciate you coming.

03:09.589 --> 03:11.819
I don't understand
how something like this can happen.

03:11.925 --> 03:12.914
I just can't believe it.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.086
We should all just settle down
and get on with our lives.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.061
It's not like
it's the end of the world.

03:18.598 --> 03:21.658
Grandpa, we all need to deal
in our own way.

03:21.801 --> 03:23.598
[Bell rings]

03:38.885 --> 03:40.216
Oh.

03:40.353 --> 03:42.514
Jack, am I ringing that loud enough?

03:42.622 --> 03:44.453
'Cause it took you a while.

03:45.458 --> 03:47.949
Is there any more of Maggie's chili?

03:48.061 --> 03:49.153
Might be.

03:49.262 --> 03:51.127
Love some. No hurry.

03:51.698 --> 03:55.429
And I'm thirsty.
So, maybe a cup of coffee.

03:55.535 --> 03:58.163
If it's fresh.
Don't make a pot on my account.

03:58.271 --> 04:00.432
Oh, and I'd love a piece
of that apple pie.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.734
Jack. Jack, Jack, Jack.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.604
Do we have cheddar cheese?

04:05.812 --> 04:09.646
Just a piece on the side if we do.

04:09.749 --> 04:12.684
Just if we do. Thanks.

Amy, you haven't helped me once.
It's your turn.

04:57.597 --> 05:00.395
I'll take it.
I'd like to surprise him.

05:00.566 --> 05:02.466
- Just down the hall to the right.
- Okay.

05:04.804 --> 05:05.793
Why is she here?

05:05.972 --> 05:07.564
She sold Big River Ranch to him.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.141
They must have kept in touch.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.504
She did more than that.

05:10.610 --> 05:13.272
She was flirting up a storm with him
on the cattle drive.

05:13.379 --> 05:15.870
Well, I mean,
he hasn't mentioned her since.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.006
Maybe they're friends.

05:17.116 --> 05:18.777
I just hope
she doesn't plan on staying.

05:18.885 --> 05:21.353
There's already one too many guests
in this house as it is.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.684
Grandpa, Dad had surgery
four days ago.

05:24.357 --> 05:25.984
You know he has to stay with us.

05:26.092 --> 05:27.992
The doctor said he couldn't
possibly cope on his own.

05:28.094 --> 05:31.530
Did that doctor ever consider
how I'd cope?

05:32.498 --> 05:34.363
You know, Tim's been milking
this bullet wound

05:34.467 --> 05:37.163
like a dairy farmer with 10 hands.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.363
- Where are you going?
- Out.

05:39.472 --> 05:40.632
Don't wait dinner for me.

05:40.740 --> 05:41.707
Tell His Highness

05:41.808 --> 05:43.332
he can have my share.

05:45.244 --> 05:45.835
Hey.

05:45.945 --> 05:47.708
Well, hello.

05:47.814 --> 05:49.281
Hello, cowboy.

05:49.382 --> 05:51.942
- Yeah. Right there.
- Hello.

05:52.051 --> 05:54.451
- Oh, you poor guy.
- Ow.

05:54.554 --> 05:56.920
- Poor you.
- Yeah, I got to watch that.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.718
What were you thinking, facing down
a bunch of armed rustlers?

05:59.826 --> 06:02.386
Yeah. No hero.

06:02.495 --> 06:05.055
I lost practically my whole herd.

06:05.164 --> 06:07.860
Except that stupid pair of longhorns.

06:07.967 --> 06:10.561
Not even the bad guys
wanted the longhorns.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.599
60 head. Gone.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.197
They'll track 'em down.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.777
Oh, I don't know about that.

06:18.878 --> 06:22.245
It's not exactly a crack city
police force we got here.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.714
Come on.
Don't diss Hudsors finest.

06:24.884 --> 06:28.149
Thanks for coming.
It's good to see you.

06:28.254 --> 06:30.415
I'm glad you feel that way.

06:30.523 --> 06:32.991
I'm not exactly sure
about the others.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.890
They kind of acted
like they didn't know who I was.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.895
You did tell them about us, right?

06:39.031 --> 06:40.896
Yeah, they're fine.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.126
They're just not good with change.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.903
- What if she's his girlfriend?
- Amy, calm down.

06:48.007 --> 06:49.497
No, she must be his girlfriend.

06:49.609 --> 06:52.203
I think he would have said
something if he had a girlfriend.

06:52.311 --> 06:55.178
Hey, Amy, that new horse arrived,
the one that needs re-homing.

06:55.281 --> 06:57.511
- What horse?
- Boxer.

06:57.617 --> 06:58.777
Jack made all the arrangements.

06:58.885 --> 07:01.115
Oh, great.
And of course he's not here.

07:01.287 --> 07:02.720
I'm just the messenger.

07:02.822 --> 07:04.449
I wish everyone would just chill.

07:04.557 --> 07:06.081
I mean, I know things
are a little bent

07:06.192 --> 07:08.183
with Dad here,
and now Callie,

07:08.294 --> 07:10.694
but I'm the one doing all the work
in that area, so...

07:10.797 --> 07:11.991
[Bell rings]

07:12.098 --> 07:13.929
[Sighs]

07:16.369 --> 07:18.166
There you are, Boxer.
There you go.

07:18.271 --> 07:21.069
Okay, I think I'm pushing off.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.471
All right.

07:22.575 --> 07:24.702
So, say good-bye nice.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.802
Come here.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.610
- Are you coming over later?
- I'll try.

07:33.719 --> 07:35.744
Shut up.

07:36.456 --> 07:40.552
Okay. Just don't bring
this disgustingly filthy hat.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.025
What's wrong with my hat?

07:42.161 --> 07:44.026
- Hey.
- AMY: Hey.

07:44.130 --> 07:44.824
Later, Ty.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.694
Hi, boy.
So you're Boxer, huh?

07:51.804 --> 07:54.329
This guy's old, but he seems
in pretty good shape.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.333
How you doing?

07:57.944 --> 08:00.174
Maybe Caleb knows someone
who's looking for a horse.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.247
You could ask him.

08:05.251 --> 08:07.685
You know, he's acting
a bit weird today.

08:07.787 --> 08:09.584
Maybe you should give him a call.

08:11.123 --> 08:12.920
Maybe.

08:16.529 --> 08:20.021
Well, this was really lovely.
Thanks.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.830
I should probably go.

08:22.935 --> 08:23.731
Go where?

08:23.836 --> 08:24.928
I booked into a hotel.

08:25.037 --> 08:26.504
No. No, no. Stay here.

08:26.606 --> 08:27.834
I'm absolutely fine at the hotel.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.771
Besides, they have a full house
with you here.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.207
No. We've probably got
an extra cabin at the dude ranch.

08:32.311 --> 08:33.607
Anybody checking in this week?

08:33.746 --> 08:35.236
No, but...

08:35.347 --> 08:37.873
So, there you go.
Stay here. End of story.

08:38.049 --> 08:40.917
Dad, you can't just shove Callie
out into the dude ranch

08:41.020 --> 08:42.385
in the middle of nowhere by herself.

08:42.488 --> 08:44.284
I mean, I'm used to it out there,
but trust me...

08:44.390 --> 08:45.857
So, she can stay in your room?

08:45.958 --> 08:47.892
That's nice of you, Lou.

08:47.994 --> 08:50.360
No, I'm not putting anybody
out of their room.

08:50.463 --> 08:53.125
You know what?
It's fine. Yeah.

08:53.232 --> 08:55.700
- Are you sure?
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

08:55.801 --> 08:58.929
Okay. Thanks.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.733
Why did you do that?
Now she's staying here.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.604
Amy, it's one night.
Relax, okay.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.440
- What is this?
- Nothing. It's nothing.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.572
"The Lou/Mark Mix"?
Are you kidding?

09:09.682 --> 09:11.081
Is this a mix CD?
This is a mix CD.

09:11.183 --> 09:13.447
- What, are we in high school?
- Give it to me!

09:13.553 --> 09:15.180
Are you guys going steady?

09:16.188 --> 09:17.917
- Shut up.
- You can't be serious.

09:18.024 --> 09:20.993
- Maybe I am a bit serious.
- Lou, this is so not you.

09:21.093 --> 09:22.993
Well, that is not entirely
a bad thing.

09:23.763 --> 09:25.196
Anyway, I came in here to tell you,

09:25.298 --> 09:26.788
you don't have to move out
to the dude ranch.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.332
You can just stay in my room.

09:28.501 --> 09:29.900
Thank you.

09:30.002 --> 09:31.902
But you shouldn't
have to move at all.

09:32.004 --> 09:35.565
I mean, you didn't offer your room
in the first place.

09:37.510 --> 09:38.772
"I Shot The Sheriff'?

09:38.878 --> 09:42.245
Okay, that's it.
Give me that CD right now.

09:42.348 --> 09:43.576
Give it back!

09:50.856 --> 09:52.346
Be out in a minute.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.449
Take your time.

09:54.560 --> 10:00.590
We're out of toothpaste,
just so you know.

10:03.803 --> 10:06.465
Oh, look, it's the blanket grabber.

10:06.572 --> 10:08.972
Yeah, says the bed hogger.

10:09.075 --> 10:11.600
Whatever. I should have let you
sleep at the dude ranch.

10:11.711 --> 10:13.076
I ended up on the floor twice.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.443
Oh, and your elbows
are like little knives.

10:15.581 --> 10:17.879
You know what?
I'm the one covered in bruises.

10:17.984 --> 10:19.952
Morning.

10:20.753 --> 10:22.220
Good morning, everybody.

10:22.321 --> 10:25.119
I hope you slept well.
I had the best sleep.

10:25.224 --> 10:25.986
Oh, coffee!

10:26.726 --> 10:28.523
Thanks, Jack.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.490
[Bell rings]

10:31.664 --> 10:34.064
No, no, no, no, no.
It's okay, Lou. I'll go.

10:36.535 --> 10:37.900
Callie's here early.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.198
Yeah, not really.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.671
She never left.

10:46.412 --> 10:48.403
So, Callie actually kicked Lou
out of her own room last night,

10:48.614 --> 10:50.047
so I only got an hour of sleep.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.912
It's so rude.
She just invited herself.

10:52.018 --> 10:55.419
- Hey, Callie.
- Hey.

10:55.521 --> 10:58.149
I thought I might take out
one of the horses,

10:58.257 --> 10:59.315
if that's all right?

10:59.425 --> 11:00.414
Sure.

11:00.526 --> 11:02.687
TY: Just give me a minute,
and I'll saddle one up for you.

11:02.795 --> 11:03.955
That'd be great, thanks.

It's got "I Fought the Law
and the Law Won,"

23:09.688 --> 23:11.451
"Roxanne" by the Police.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.046
"I Shot the Sheriff."

23:13.225 --> 23:15.785
Yeah. You can listen to it
on the way to a shake-up.

23:15.894 --> 23:18.226
Or a shake-down.
Or whatever.

23:18.330 --> 23:19.922
Have I told you you're cute?

23:20.699 --> 23:21.461
Nope.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.625
Well, you are.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.703
You're crazy, but cute.

23:29.141 --> 23:32.076
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:32.177 --> 23:34.202
Right. Okay. Business.

23:34.312 --> 23:35.301
Business. Yes.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.713
You said you had an update.
Good news?

23:38.817 --> 23:40.944
No, it's not great.

23:41.052 --> 23:42.349
There's no trace?

23:42.487 --> 23:44.921
No. There's a list a mile long
of slaughterhouses

23:45.023 --> 23:46.490
who don't ask enough questions.

23:46.591 --> 23:48.923
I can't believe the incompetence.

23:49.494 --> 23:51.826
The RCMP is doing all we can do.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.921
- Yeah? What are you doing exactly?
- Dad.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.327
We're following every lead.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.992
We're on the lookout
for the vehicles used.

23:57.169 --> 23:58.602
Oh, so you're on it.

23:58.737 --> 24:00.864
Look, I have a bit of an issue
with how you handled things.

24:00.972 --> 24:02.940
You got yourself involved
in a direct confrontation.

24:03.041 --> 24:04.668
It's a miracle
more people werert hurt.

24:04.776 --> 24:06.073
You are lucky we didn't arrest you

24:06.211 --> 24:07.143
for taking the law
into your own hands.

24:07.245 --> 24:10.146
Yeah, me and all the ranchers
who lost their shirts.

24:10.248 --> 24:11.840
Why don't we all go to jail?

24:11.950 --> 24:13.281
- Go ahead, arrest us.
- Dad.

24:13.385 --> 24:15.649
No, the victims are the ones
that should be in jail.

24:15.754 --> 24:18.848
I mean, we'd be easier to catch.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.219
Excuse me.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.927
Mark.

24:23.728 --> 24:26.128
Mark, that was a bit over the top,
don't you think?

24:26.298 --> 24:28.528
Arrest him?
My dad almost died.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.895
Hey, you know, I've been dealing
with a lot of these ranchers,

24:31.002 --> 24:32.196
and they all act like the RCMP

24:32.304 --> 24:34.135
should be their own personal
cow bodyguard.

24:34.239 --> 24:35.228
So, I'm sorry.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.872
Look, it's okay.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.208
I can imagine what you're up against.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.679
Would you just come here?

24:50.655 --> 24:53.886
Don't be mad at me.
I'm not the crazy vigilante here.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.222
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:03.668 --> 25:04.760
Okay, I'm on duty.

25:04.870 --> 25:06.565
If I don't go now,
I'm not going at all.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.161
Then, don't.

25:09.140 --> 25:10.437
You should behave yourself.

25:10.542 --> 25:13.602
Or what?
You're gonna arrest me?

25:15.780 --> 25:17.543
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.

25:17.649 --> 25:18.547
Yeah.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.481
Oh, what do you mean tomorrow?

25:20.585 --> 25:24.487
Lunch reservations
at the Banff Springs, remember?

25:24.589 --> 25:25.214
2:00?

25:25.323 --> 25:27.314
Oh, oh, geez.

25:27.425 --> 25:28.949
Oh, I'm so sorry.

25:29.060 --> 25:32.757
Look, I have a provincial review
meeting in Edmonton tomorrow.

25:32.864 --> 25:35.662
Lou, I totally forgot.
I'm so sorry.

25:35.767 --> 25:37.291
Okay.

25:37.402 --> 25:39.666
But listen,
I am gonna make it up to you.

25:39.771 --> 25:41.932
I am gonna call you
the second I get back.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.564
We're gonna go out
for a nice dinner

25:43.675 --> 25:44.903
or a long drive somewhere,

25:45.010 --> 25:46.671
and we're gonna listen
to that CD of yours.

25:46.778 --> 25:47.642
Okay, okay.

25:47.746 --> 25:49.839
- Okay?
- Okay.

25:49.948 --> 25:50.778
- See you.
- Okay.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.077
- I'll call you.
- All right.

25:54.019 --> 25:55.543
Bye.

26:04.329 --> 26:06.627
I got to be careful.

26:06.731 --> 26:09.461
He's growing on me.

26:10.168 --> 26:13.763
Hey, what's wrong?

26:13.872 --> 26:17.467
Is it true they're not gonna get
Dad's cows back?

26:17.576 --> 26:19.806
Doesrt look like it.

26:19.945 --> 26:21.674
- It's all my fault.
- Amy.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.611
Well, it is.

26:23.715 --> 26:25.148
You know,
if I hadrt have been there,

26:25.250 --> 26:26.444
none of this would have happened.

26:26.551 --> 26:28.951
- Amy, stop.
- It's my fault, Lou!

26:29.054 --> 26:30.681
It's just so stupid!

26:30.789 --> 26:33.781
You know, I follow Ty and Caleb,
and everything gets messed up.

26:35.060 --> 26:37.119
Lou, Dad was shot because of me.

26:37.228 --> 26:39.389
Amy, that is ridiculous.

26:39.497 --> 26:42.330
Who knows how it was gonna
turn out with or without you there?

26:42.467 --> 26:45.766
Either way, it wasrt
gonna be good, okay?

26:46.471 --> 26:48.462
Listen to me.
You need to talk to Dad.

26:49.541 --> 26:51.031
You'll feel better.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.204
Just can't get comfortable.

26:57.315 --> 26:59.283
That's because you get yourself
so worked up.

26:59.384 --> 27:01.147
Now the blanket's gonna fall off
on this side.

27:01.252 --> 27:02.651
Fine.

27:02.754 --> 27:04.016
[Laughter]

27:04.122 --> 27:05.555
Dad?

27:06.291 --> 27:08.020
- Oh.
- Amy.

27:10.929 --> 27:14.387
Amy, Boxer's gone.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.344
Boxer?

27:41.026 --> 27:42.891
Hey, boy.

27:42.994 --> 27:45.929
Now, you had us all worried.

27:46.031 --> 27:48.522
Yes, you did.

27:50.902 --> 27:52.961
You like the cows, don't you?

27:55.140 --> 27:58.701
Of course you do.
You worked on a dairy farm.

27:59.411 --> 28:01.504
You miss it?

28:01.613 --> 28:03.376
At least he's eating again.

28:03.481 --> 28:05.540
Those cows really made his day.

28:06.317 --> 28:07.648
Look at this.

28:07.786 --> 28:09.947
He absolutely let himself out.

28:10.055 --> 28:11.750
I'm gonna add another bolt.

28:11.856 --> 28:14.416
Ms. Adams should have told us
he could do stunts like this.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.525
You really don't like her much,
do you?

28:17.629 --> 28:20.598
The feeling's mutual.
I've got grades to prove it.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.530
Come on, Amy.
She can't hold it against you.

28:22.634 --> 28:25.603
Yeah, 'cause teachers really love it
when you pry into their private lives.

28:26.271 --> 28:29.798
Look, this horse needs help.
That's the bottom line, all right?

28:29.908 --> 28:33.139
Regardless of the owner.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.263
Can you smell them?

28:55.366 --> 28:57.698
Yeah, you do.

28:57.969 --> 29:01.132
Attaboy. Let's go get them.

29:03.007 --> 29:04.872
Hey, Jack.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.775
What do you need?

29:07.879 --> 29:12.077
Food? Reading material?
A sponge bath?

29:12.250 --> 29:14.343
That's funny.

29:14.452 --> 29:18.582
No, I just wanted to thank you
for letting me stay here.

29:19.457 --> 29:20.515
Don't mention it.

29:20.625 --> 29:23.685
But I'm thinking of going back
to Big River Ranch.

29:23.795 --> 29:26.559
Well, Callie's taken some time off
so she can help me.

29:26.664 --> 29:27.596
I should be okay.

29:27.699 --> 29:31.465
I just don't want it
to insult your hospitality.

29:31.569 --> 29:34.333
No. Not at all.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.299
Not at all.

29:42.180 --> 29:45.445
So, I hear you're leaving.

29:45.550 --> 29:48.986
Yeah. It's gonna be nice
to spend some time at the ranch.

29:49.087 --> 29:51.351
Plus, I'll be out of your hair.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.151
I'm really sorry
if I was in the way.

29:53.258 --> 29:56.659
No, no. Not at all.

29:57.495 --> 30:00.225
Let me get this straight.
Are you living with my dad?

30:00.965 --> 30:04.560
No, I still have my place
in Calgary, but...

30:04.669 --> 30:06.034
Well, you know, when I'm here.

30:07.105 --> 30:09.505
Oh. Really?

30:10.508 --> 30:14.069
Okay, I just have to ask this.
Why do you all dislike me so much?

30:14.179 --> 30:16.238
No, Callie, look.
We don't dislike you.

30:16.347 --> 30:17.336
I don't even know you.

30:17.448 --> 30:18.915
But you knew I've been
seeing your father

30:19.017 --> 30:20.075
ever since the cattle drive.

30:20.185 --> 30:22.346
No, I didn't.

30:22.453 --> 30:24.080
So, I'm sorry if...

30:24.189 --> 30:25.247
He didn't tell you?

30:25.423 --> 30:26.822
No, he didn't say a word.

30:26.925 --> 30:30.361
So, you have to understand
this has been a bit of a surprise

30:30.528 --> 30:31.495
for all of us, and...

30:31.596 --> 30:32.358
Right.

30:32.463 --> 30:36.160
I mean, forgive us if we didn't
exactly, you know, embrace it.

30:37.335 --> 30:40.668
Well, I totally understand now.

30:40.772 --> 30:43.002
I'll see you later.

30:43.107 --> 30:44.734
Good one, Dad.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.277
Do you have you any idea
how stupid I feel?

30:47.412 --> 30:48.845
Callie, shh.

30:48.947 --> 30:51.245
What?

30:51.749 --> 30:53.944
- Don't make such a big...
- What? Big deal?

30:54.052 --> 30:56.577
I thought it was a big deal, Tim.
I thought I meant something to you.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.713
But apparently not, because nobody
even knows about me.

30:58.823 --> 30:59.949
That's not true.

31:00.058 --> 31:02.754
Now, you know that I didn't want
to involve my daughters in this.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.795
Not yet.
You have to understand that.

31:04.896 --> 31:07.592
I don't understand it, Tim.
I don't understand it at all.

31:07.699 --> 31:08.893
I'm gonna drive back to Calgary.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.865
The hell with you
and your stupid bullet wound.

31:11.002 --> 31:12.060
Callie!

31:12.203 --> 31:13.568
- Callie, wait.
- Mmm-mmm.

31:13.671 --> 31:15.468
Wait. We'll talk about this
back at the ranch.

31:15.573 --> 31:17.302
It's just hard
with all these people around.

31:17.408 --> 31:18.705
What, all these people?

31:18.810 --> 31:21.973
It's hard on you putting up with us?

31:22.080 --> 31:24.446
I'll just give her some time
to cool down.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.642
Hey, you're not going with her?

31:26.751 --> 31:29.276
Go with her!

32:01.419 --> 32:03.011
We get in his way?

32:03.121 --> 32:04.918
He has a hard time
dealing with us?

32:05.023 --> 32:07.048
I have had it, Lou.
He has got to go!

32:07.158 --> 32:09.683
Grandpa, breathe.

32:13.865 --> 32:15.662
[Loud rock music plays]

32:29.647 --> 32:30.978
Hang on a second.

32:39.724 --> 32:41.692
Lou. Lou.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.385
Have a good trip to Edmonton?

32:43.528 --> 32:46.156
- Lou, just hang on.
- Do not apologize to me.

32:46.264 --> 32:48.596
Apologize?
Why would I apologize?

32:48.700 --> 32:50.531
Now, what exactly
would I apologize for?

32:50.635 --> 32:53.297
Gee, I don't know.
Maybe because you lied to me?

32:53.404 --> 32:55.770
Maybe because there's
another woman in your truck?

32:55.873 --> 32:59.240
Maybe because you're making out
with her to our mix CD?

32:59.377 --> 33:01.038
Just hang on.
Whoa, whoa.

33:01.145 --> 33:02.612
Now, look, Lou.

33:02.714 --> 33:05.649
We go out.
We have fun together.

33:05.750 --> 33:08.344
But we're not together together.

33:09.387 --> 33:14.620
I mean, I'm seeing other people.
You're seeing other people, right?

33:16.861 --> 33:18.556
Oh.

33:31.209 --> 33:33.177
Lou, are you awake?

33:33.277 --> 33:36.178
Yeah. I am now.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.613
What?

33:38.716 --> 33:39.944
Hey.

33:40.118 --> 33:40.880
What is it?

33:40.985 --> 33:42.577
Can we talk?

33:42.687 --> 33:43.278
Yeah.

33:43.388 --> 33:44.980
Yeah, of course.
Come here.

33:48.326 --> 33:50.794
What's wrong?

33:51.629 --> 33:52.994
I can't breathe.

33:53.131 --> 33:54.120
Amy.

33:54.232 --> 33:56.223
It's Dad.

33:58.002 --> 33:59.560
I feel so guilty.

33:59.670 --> 34:04.505
Amy, we already talked about this.
It wasrt your fault.

34:04.609 --> 34:07.043
We had this big fight right before.

34:07.145 --> 34:10.672
And I can't say I'm sorry.
I can't even talk to him.

34:10.782 --> 34:12.612
Sweetie, you will.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.811
I don't know, Lou.

34:16.788 --> 34:20.746
I mean, I can't even seem
to get close to him.

34:20.858 --> 34:23.121
And now he's got a girlfriend,

34:23.226 --> 34:27.163
and he just keeps moving
farther away.

34:27.264 --> 34:29.755
I don't know. I'm afraid
to get close to anyone.

34:29.867 --> 34:31.664
Every time I do,
I end up losing them.

34:31.768 --> 34:33.134
No, you don't.

34:33.271 --> 34:35.670
Yes, I do. Look at Ty.

34:36.873 --> 34:40.310
He knows me
better than anyone, and...

34:40.411 --> 34:42.208
I just let him go.

34:44.014 --> 34:46.141
Now he's got Kit.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.480
She's over all the time.

34:48.585 --> 34:50.110
And...

34:52.690 --> 34:54.817
Caleb kissed me.

34:57.195 --> 34:59.823
It's just all messed up.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.092
Boys suck.

35:07.138 --> 35:12.940
Remember how I was supposed
to go to Banff with Mark?

35:13.044 --> 35:14.272
Yeah.

35:14.378 --> 35:18.815
I saw him in town with another girl.

35:18.983 --> 35:20.280
Lou.

35:20.384 --> 35:23.012
I lost it on him.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.748
It's so over.

35:24.856 --> 35:26.346
I'm so sorry.

35:26.457 --> 35:27.651
Yeah.

35:27.758 --> 35:31.250
Just as I was really starting
to like him, you know?

35:31.362 --> 35:33.694
Maybe more than like him.

35:34.799 --> 35:37.233
Well, he wasrt good enough
for you, anyway.

35:38.936 --> 35:40.699
Thanks.

35:40.805 --> 35:43.706
Anyway, it was a rebound
from the start, right?

35:43.808 --> 35:46.504
I fell way too hard too soon.

35:48.479 --> 35:50.003
Be careful about that rebound thing.

35:50.114 --> 35:51.376
I will.

35:51.482 --> 35:53.177
Yeah? What about Caleb?

35:53.284 --> 35:55.775
What about Caleb?

35:55.887 --> 35:58.515
He kissed you.
Don't you want to know why?

35:58.623 --> 36:00.853
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

36:04.128 --> 36:05.891
[Knocking at door]

36:06.597 --> 36:10.795
There's someone to see you.

36:14.739 --> 36:16.730
I would like to talk to you.

36:17.475 --> 36:18.271
Sure.

36:18.376 --> 36:22.676
My father's with Ty,
visiting Boxer.

36:22.780 --> 36:24.645
I wanted to...

36:25.950 --> 36:26.939
...apologize.

36:27.051 --> 36:28.643
I shouldn't have brought
your father here

36:28.753 --> 36:30.778
without asking more questions.

36:30.888 --> 36:31.912
I am so sorry.

36:32.056 --> 36:34.820
You had no way of knowing.

36:36.727 --> 36:40.254
You know, that little visit...

36:40.364 --> 36:43.299
He remembers every bit of it.
Totally.

36:43.401 --> 36:45.460
It meant a lot to him.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.231
Your father's thoughts
might be muddled,

36:47.338 --> 36:50.705
but his memories are...

36:50.808 --> 36:52.799
I don't know... true.

36:52.910 --> 36:54.605
Yeah.

36:54.712 --> 36:57.579
There's something
pretty important in that.

36:58.683 --> 37:01.584
It must be hard,
what's happening to him.

37:01.686 --> 37:06.385
It's a horrible thing, this disease.

37:06.490 --> 37:09.084
Do you have someone
who can help you?

37:09.193 --> 37:11.957
No, not really.

37:12.063 --> 37:14.224
My mother died when I was 17.

37:15.333 --> 37:16.925
And I couldn't leave my father,

37:17.034 --> 37:18.558
not after everything
he'd done for me.

37:18.669 --> 37:22.503
So, I never got married or had...

37:24.508 --> 37:26.499
He's all I have, Amy.

37:27.745 --> 37:29.975
And he's fading away.

37:30.081 --> 37:31.446
I'm losing him.

37:32.717 --> 37:34.651
He's still here.

37:34.752 --> 37:37.220
And he remembers things.

37:37.321 --> 37:40.779
He remembers Boxer,
and Boxer remembers him, too.

37:40.891 --> 37:42.188
Boxer may just be a horse,

37:42.293 --> 37:46.525
but he devoted his life to Hank,
just like you.

37:46.631 --> 37:49.930
Maybe they deserve every chance
they can to be together.

37:53.437 --> 37:56.099
How about that guy, huh?
Chasing cows at his age?

37:56.207 --> 37:57.731
He's still got it, Hank.

38:00.478 --> 38:01.843
Bartlett.

38:01.946 --> 38:02.742
Jack.

38:02.847 --> 38:06.681
I haven't seen you in years.

38:06.851 --> 38:11.311
Come on up to the house, Hank.
I want you to hear something.

38:12.490 --> 38:15.152

You did good.

Hey.

40:16.714 --> 40:18.341
Hey.

40:21.585 --> 40:24.110
I'm sorry about Callie.

40:24.221 --> 40:25.654
I hope you guys are okay.

40:26.924 --> 40:28.949
Dad, you should call her.
Don't just let her go.

40:30.628 --> 40:32.425
She makes you happy, right?

40:34.665 --> 40:36.496
Yeah, she does.

40:37.902 --> 40:40.132
Maybe I should just wait.

She'll come back, you know?

'Cause of my obvious charm.

40:47.211 --> 40:49.475
I'd call her.

40:50.080 --> 40:52.844
Okay, I'll call her.

40:56.420 --> 40:58.047
What?

40:59.557 --> 41:01.149
Hey, what's the matter?

41:01.258 --> 41:04.125
I'm so sorry.

41:04.228 --> 41:05.661
Sorry for what?

41:05.763 --> 41:08.323
It's because of me that you got hurt.

41:08.432 --> 41:10.764
No, honey, honey.

41:10.868 --> 41:12.028
No, don't go there.

41:12.136 --> 41:14.127
No, I was a damn fool
to do what I did.

41:14.872 --> 41:17.033
What if you had been killed?

41:17.141 --> 41:19.871
Yeah, but I wasrt.

41:19.977 --> 41:22.468
I'm right here.
I'm always gonna be right next door.

41:22.580 --> 41:25.879
That's why I bought
that damn ranch.

41:26.050 --> 41:27.677
It wasrt just for those longhorns.

41:31.121 --> 41:32.679
Come on.
You better help me pack.

41:32.790 --> 41:34.781
Your grandpa's gonna
come after me with another gun

41:34.892 --> 41:36.086
if I don't get out of here.

41:36.193 --> 41:37.990
Probably.

41:39.430 --> 41:41.022
Seen your sister?

41:41.131 --> 41:42.723
Lou's supposed to give me
a ride home.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.425
Dad, you don't have to go.

41:44.535 --> 41:46.594
Oh, yes, I do.

41:46.704 --> 41:50.333
Yes, I do.

[Knocking on door]

42:17.067 --> 42:18.034
Just...

42:20.104 --> 42:21.093
Hi.

42:22.573 --> 42:27.374
I thought message number nine
was particularly good.

42:28.546 --> 42:31.174
I'm willing to give this
another shot

42:31.282 --> 42:33.113
on a couple of conditions.

42:39.590 --> 42:41.319
Oh!

42:41.425 --> 42:43.120
Sorry.

42:43.227 --> 42:45.695
That hat does look good on you.

42:45.796 --> 42:47.661
I was kind of used
to the other one.

42:47.765 --> 42:51.064
You'll get used to this one.

42:58.642 --> 43:01.770
So, I tried to call your phone,
but it was dead.

43:01.879 --> 43:03.437
Yeah, I forgot to pay the bill.

43:03.547 --> 43:05.037
Great.

43:05.149 --> 43:07.515
So, when are you coming back
to work?

43:07.618 --> 43:09.176
Tomorrow.

43:09.286 --> 43:10.082
Okay.

43:10.187 --> 43:12.917
But you didn't come out here
to ask me that.

43:14.491 --> 43:17.153
You're right.

43:17.328 --> 43:18.761
Caleb, you kissed me. Why?

Why?

- Does there have to be a reason?
- Yes.

43:22.866 --> 43:24.800
Yes, there does. I mean...

43:24.902 --> 43:26.665
Why did you do it?
What does it mean?

43:26.770 --> 43:28.431
It means anything you want it to.

43:28.539 --> 43:31.406
No, I am so sick and tired
of mixed messages.

43:31.508 --> 43:33.976
I'm tired of not knowing
where people stand.

43:34.078 --> 43:36.808
Okay. Fine.
I'll be straight with you.

43:36.914 --> 43:38.404
Ty and Kit are happy.

43:38.515 --> 43:41.279
And I know you need some time
to get used to it, but they are.

43:41.385 --> 43:42.647
But you know what I think?

43:42.753 --> 43:44.846
I think he gave up on you
pretty easy.

43:45.889 --> 43:47.447
When I love a girl,
you won't see me doing that.

43:47.558 --> 43:49.287
Giving up?
