-Exactly.

15:24.341 --> 15:27.344
We've gotta find Kim right away.

15:28.595 --> 15:32.724
You must throw the treasures
into the bay, my master...

15:32.891 --> 15:36.978
...to fulfill the ancient legend
and rid us of the Moon Monster.

15:37.145 --> 15:41.191
| fear you're right, Lin Foo.
But it may already be too late.

15:41.358 --> 15:43.652
FRED:
It's not too late yet, Kim.

15:44.319 --> 15:47.030
-What?
-We think Lin Foo is right.

15:47.197 --> 15:50.659
Yeah. Like, you should throw
the gold into the bay.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.828
Your friends are wise, Kim.

15:53.328 --> 15:56.498
But my legacy, my treasures.

15:57.040 --> 16:00.460
Trust us, Kim. We think we can help.

16:03.004 --> 16:05.132
Well, that's the last of it.

16:07.592 --> 16:09.052
Now what?

16:09.219 --> 16:11.513
Now we'll just do
what the legend says to do.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.849
-Throw it in the bay.
-Let me.

16:17.561 --> 16:19.104
[GROANING]

16:21.982 --> 16:24.276
SHAGGY:
Watch it, Scoob.

16:27.154 --> 16:30.115
DAPHNE: Scooby, the rope.
-Scooby!

16:34.744 --> 16:37.080
I'm okay.

16:43.712 --> 16:46.006
Like, you gotta be
more careful, Scoob.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.800
Yeah, yeah. Next time.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.136
[SPUTTERING]

17:12.531 --> 17:14.159
I'll get it, Scooby.

17:14.617 --> 17:15.827
Sorry, Velma.

17:16.286 --> 17:20.123
-Now what, Fred?
-Now you just come with us.

17:21.499 --> 17:25.127
We think you'll find this
very interesting.

17:52.155 --> 17:53.698
FRED:
Enjoy it while you can.

17:54.157 --> 17:56.660
The Moon Monster. And my treasure.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.287
Your little game is up, Moon Monster.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.666
-But how?
-Hand over the treasure.

18:02.832 --> 18:06.670
Be careful, Fred.
Like, you shouldn't make him angry.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.507
He's headed this way, Scoob.

18:10.674 --> 18:13.426
Yeah. Run.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.807
FRED:
After him.

18:18.974 --> 18:22.560
LING: But | don't understand.
-We'll explain later.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.815
He's still behind us, Scoob.

18:26.982 --> 18:28.483
[ROARS]

18:31.069 --> 18:32.570
He's just ahead.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.448
Head for the bridge!

18:39.244 --> 18:40.912
Toll bridge. Going up.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.176
[SHOUTING]

19:06.146 --> 19:07.856
Nice catch, Kim.

19:08.023 --> 19:10.150
You mean,
nice catch, Shaggy and Scooby.

19:10.525 --> 19:11.985
They caught the Moon Monster.

19:13.445 --> 19:14.946
Like, how about that, Scoob?

19:15.113 --> 19:17.324
-We're heroes.
-Not bad.

19:22.245 --> 19:26.291
LING:
Uncle Chin. But why?

19:27.000 --> 19:30.545
FRED: For the treasure, Kim.
You stood between him and a fortune.

19:30.962 --> 19:34.716
He used the legend of Moon Monster to
try and frighten you out of your legacy.

19:34.883 --> 19:38.219
But we saw him turned to stone
by the Moon Monster.

19:38.803 --> 19:42.891
Wrong, Kim. We saw what seemed
to be your Uncle Chin turned into stone.

19:43.224 --> 19:46.686
But your uncle was actually
in the Moon Monster disguise.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.481
He rang the gong
and when we got there...

19:49.647 --> 19:54.361
...It looked like a Moon Monster
had turned your uncle into a statue.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.408
Well, what was the statue, then?

20:00.825 --> 20:05.789
Your uncle carved that himself
with the ancient carving tool.

20:06.831 --> 20:10.418
It was scratched and dull
unlike the rest of his collection...

20:10.585 --> 20:12.420
...telling us it had been used lately.

20:12.754 --> 20:16.174
FRED: The grease marks on the floor
were where he pushed the statue out...

20:16.341 --> 20:18.802
...from the secret panel
before we got there.

20:20.595 --> 20:22.138
Incredible.

20:22.305 --> 20:24.933
| should not have been
fooled so, master.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.102
We were all fooled, Lin Foo.

20:27.268 --> 20:30.105
Uncle Chin knew that the tides
would wash anything...

20:30.271 --> 20:32.148
...tossed into the bay into that cave.

20:32.315 --> 20:35.610
So all he had to do was scare you
into throwing your treasure away.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.279
And then be there to get it
when it washed up.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.282
-And | would never know.
FRED: Exactly.

20:41.616 --> 20:46.287
And now | am sure we all need
a good night's rest.

20:46.454 --> 20:47.622
Or perhaps a snack?

20:48.206 --> 20:50.417
Like, thanks, Kim.

20:52.877 --> 20:55.130
Yeah, thanks.

20:56.172 --> 20:59.801
Ready, set, go.

21:49.142 --> 21:52.645
It looks like Scooby's eyes are bigger
than his stomach.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.190
Ha, ha. You mean bigger than his mouth,
don't you, Kim?
