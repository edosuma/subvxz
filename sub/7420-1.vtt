Roger. Copy winds at 15.
We've got Mr. Brakus on board.

Signify tower when approaching pad.

03:14.938 --> 03:18.750

03:49.506 --> 03:53.921
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Mr. Brakus.

04:23.173 --> 04:26.416
- Good evening, Mr. Brakus.
- Hi, Mr. Brakus.

04:35.519 --> 04:38.796
- Lose it.
- Sorry, Mr. Brakus. I-

04:38.855 --> 04:41.199
What did I say about guns?

04:41.258 --> 04:43.534
They're unmanly.
It won't happen again.

04:43.593 --> 04:47.405
Warriors fight here.
Get rid of it.

04:57.666 --> 04:59.904
You're at 200 feet below
the surface of the earth...

04:59.943 --> 05:02.373
where you, our special
guests, will witness

05:02.399 --> 05:04.883
the deadliest of combat,
the highest stakes.

05:04.915 --> 05:07.486
- It's a forum for gladiators!
- Mr. Brakus coming through.

05:07.551 --> 05:10.031
Lust like in ancient Rome.

05:10.086 --> 05:14.159
Not in Rome.
You are in Las Vegas!

05:14.224 --> 05:17.364
It's My kind of town!

05:17.427 --> 05:20.670
- Are you ready to rock and roll?
- Yea h!

05:20.730 --> 05:23.040
Are you ready to rumble?

05:32.676 --> 05:35.350
Okay. All right.

05:37.113 --> 05:41.459
Welcome, welcome to the Coliseum,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:41.518 --> 05:44.897
The greatest show under
the face of the earth.

05:44.955 --> 05:46.901
The Coliseum.

05:46.957 --> 05:51.838
That means the ultimate
in fighting competition with no referee...

05:51.895 --> 05:53.841
no rules...

05:53.897 --> 05:56.434
and open to anyone-

05:56.500 --> 06:00.038
anyone with big brass balls.

06:02.339 --> 06:06.048
For those of you that are here for
the first time, this is how it works.

06:06.109 --> 06:07.910
Our finalists from
our preliminary

06:07.936 --> 06:09.479
tournaments are privileged...

06:09.513 --> 06:13.051
to challenge our stable
of modern gladiators.

06:13.116 --> 06:16.097
Take a look!

06:30.834 --> 06:33.178
They'd kill their mothers!

06:33.236 --> 06:35.842
I'll bet on him!

06:37.240 --> 06:39.914
Mean as cat shit!

06:44.080 --> 06:46.321
What a bonanza!

06:46.383 --> 06:48.954
Oh!

06:50.620 --> 06:53.965
Now, if our challenger is successful
in defeating the first gladiator...

06:54.024 --> 06:57.699
he will win $20,000.

07:00.330 --> 07:02.640
Should he be successful
at the second gladiator...

07:02.699 --> 07:07.148
he will win $50,000.

07:07.203 --> 07:10.446
That's 50,000 big ones.

07:10.507 --> 07:13.454
Now, if by some
divine intervention...

07:13.510 --> 07:17.822
the challenger defeats
all three gladiators...

07:17.881 --> 07:22.796
then he has earned the right to challenge
the supreme fighter...

07:22.852 --> 07:26.231
for the ownership
of the Coliseum.

07:28.892 --> 07:32.499
The ultimate warrior
who has never known defeat...

07:33.563 --> 07:38.034
the master and owner
of the Coliseum...

07:39.302 --> 07:43.341
the champion of the underworld...

07:43.406 --> 07:46.410
Brakus!

08:00.490 --> 08:03.494
Brakus! Brakus!

08:10.300 --> 08:13.076
Yes! The betting cages are now closed...

08:13.136 --> 08:16.110
so let the fights begin!

08:16.830 --> 08:19.259
We have a spectacular
contest for you tonight.

08:19.299 --> 08:24.305
The Coliseum's newest gladiator,
all the way from Paris, France...

08:24.371 --> 08:27.784
Andre Mares!

08:35.215 --> 08:39.789
The challenger, fresh from three
consecutive wins in the preliminaries...

08:39.852 --> 08:42.527
all the way from
North Las Vegas...

08:42.589 --> 08:45.126
Mr. Travis Brickley!

08:45.192 --> 08:48.469
A 5 -to-7 underdog.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.668
Paris, my ass.

08:50.731 --> 08:54.201
Remember,
when the buzzer sounds...

08:54.268 --> 08:57.806
there is only one rule-

08:57.871 --> 09:00.283
There are no rules!

09:00.340 --> 09:02.411
And you love it! Yes!

09:04.711 --> 09:07.749
Fighters, take your corners.

09:07.815 --> 09:12.764
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Coliseum!

09:15.255 --> 09:18.828
Andre!

09:36.577 --> 09:37.954
- Go!
- Come on!

09:42.182 --> 09:44.958
- Yeah! Come on!
- Yeah! Allright.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.242
Sorry about that, Sinbad.

09:58.298 --> 10:01.643
There's a new boy in town!

10:35.611 --> 10:38.683
- Alex, you know what?
- Huh?

10:38.748 --> 10:42.025
If he doesn't get it this time,
he'll get it on the next try.

10:42.085 --> 10:44.964
Oh, I know it, Tommy,
but he's growing up so fast.

10:45.021 --> 10:47.661
He made me promise that
if he gets his black belt...

10:47.724 --> 10:49.965
I let him drive the car.

10:50.026 --> 10:52.973
So? Let him drive the car.

10:53.029 --> 10:57.136
Tommy, I've only got one car.

11:00.570 --> 11:02.516
Look at him.

11:04.107 --> 11:06.781
God, I hope
he makes it tomorrow.

11:06.843 --> 11:08.845
Relax. He'll make it.

11:08.911 --> 11:11.482
Yeah. At least he had
one of the best teachers in the world.

11:11.547 --> 11:13.891
- Thanks, man.
- I was talking about me.

11:13.950 --> 11:17.363
Walter, go to bed. Come on.

11:20.656 --> 11:23.159
Oh, Honey, if you take your shoe off,
I can kiss your foot.

11:23.226 --> 11:26.105
Hey, Travis.
What a hell of a fight.

11:26.162 --> 11:28.335
- You killed my guy.
- Yeah, I did.

11:28.398 --> 11:31.038
You took him like
Grant took Richmond.

11:31.100 --> 11:35.776
- Thank you, sir.
- So tell me, how good are you, really?

11:35.838 --> 11:37.875
I'm good enough to beat
any of your steroid freaks.

11:41.778 --> 11:46.818
- Including that one.
- Open your mouth.

11:46.883 --> 11:49.159
How long's it been since
you fought? About six months?

11:49.218 --> 11:52.199
Mmm. Call him.

11:52.255 --> 11:55.896
- Or are the fights fixed?
- Go ahead, then.

11:55.958 --> 11:58.529
What, are you injured?

11:58.594 --> 12:01.871
One or two punches right on the chin,
I believe you'd go right out.

12:01.931 --> 12:04.810
You have a big mouth, boy.

12:04.867 --> 12:07.711
And a big everything else.

12:07.770 --> 12:11.718
So why don't you stop wasting time.
Put me in the ring with him.

12:12.942 --> 12:16.253
Weldon, give him what he wants.

12:16.312 --> 12:19.418
- You want Brakus?
- Yes, I do.

12:21.818 --> 12:24.230
You got it.

12:29.498 --> 12:32.741
- Black belt candidates.
- Sir!

12:34.603 --> 12:36.913
Attention.

12:36.972 --> 12:39.043
Present your papers.

12:46.782 --> 12:49.058
Ready? Begin.

13:32.494 --> 13:34.496
Break!

13:36.365 --> 13:38.311
Point.

13:38.367 --> 13:41.280
Yeah! All right!

13:41.337 --> 13:43.874
I'm proud of you, Walter.

13:43.939 --> 13:45.885
You taught that boy a lesson.

13:45.941 --> 13:49.855
Now, it's showtime.

13:49.912 --> 13:53.359
- I can do it.
- They're waiting on you.

13:53.415 --> 13:57.056
Black belt candidates,
are you ready to break your bricks?

13:57.119 --> 14:00.032
Yes, sir!

14:00.089 --> 14:03.400
Ready? Begin.

14:03.459 --> 14:05.996
Hyah!

14:06.061 --> 14:08.007
Hyah!

14:19.875 --> 14:21.912
- Oh.
- Oh.

14:28.884 --> 14:30.886
Hyah!

14:34.423 --> 14:37.563
- Walter?
- Yes,sir?

14:37.626 --> 14:41.233
If you don't break,
you don't pass.

14:41.297 --> 14:44.540
- You know that?
- Yes, sir.

15:21.036 --> 15:23.710
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

15:23.772 --> 15:25.774
Walter, come on.

15:27.676 --> 15:31.317
Walter, are you gonna be okay?

15:32.715 --> 15:36.390
Yeah, I'll be okay.
I'll get it on the next try.

15:37.720 --> 15:40.894
- Cheer up, okay?
- Come on, Walter.

15:40.956 --> 15:42.902
We gonna get lucky tonight.

15:42.958 --> 15:46.098
My little ass-kicker.
Let's go make him feel good.

15:47.815 --> 15:51.058
- Very happy to be here.
- Did you always know?

15:51.118 --> 15:54.156
Now you stay here.
Make like a hat rack.

15:55.790 --> 15:57.736
Mr. Brickley.

16:01.862 --> 16:04.672
I blew it.

16:04.732 --> 16:07.338
You look the same to me.

16:10.271 --> 16:12.751
Hey, Walter, look-it there.

16:12.807 --> 16:13.688
Hey, it's Dae Han.

16:13.714 --> 16:16.405
He gave Tommy one hell of a fight.
Remember that?

16:16.444 --> 16:19.084
It's only a violent sport.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.558
- Thank you for that.
- Mmm.

16:21.616 --> 16:24.756
Well, he'll be cool.
Now be his daddy.

16:24.819 --> 16:27.390
- Walter Grady's daddy always be cool.
- Oh, yeah?

16:27.455 --> 16:30.026
Mmm.

16:30.091 --> 16:33.470
- Say hi to Tommy.
- Hi, Tommy.

16:33.527 --> 16:36.667
In this tour
we hope to share...

16:36.731 --> 16:40.338
the beauty and the art
of tae kwon do...

16:40.401 --> 16:42.972
along with its power.

16:44.538 --> 16:48.611
For KXRT Sports,
I'm Sue MacCauley.

16:50.678 --> 16:54.626
Everyone, I would like
to propose a toast...

16:54.682 --> 16:57.356
to those who have received
their belts today...

16:59.020 --> 17:02.194
and to those who will
receive them tomorrow.

17:02.256 --> 17:04.292
To the team.

17:04.358 --> 17:06.395
To the team.

17:08.796 --> 17:12.436
Alex, why don't you say
a couple words?

17:15.803 --> 17:18.909
Uh, years ago
when Walter's mother passed away...

17:18.973 --> 17:21.044
I didn't know how
I was going to make it.

17:21.108 --> 17:26.182
She was everything.
And it's tough to lose everything.

17:26.247 --> 17:30.923
Son, today, all I wanted
was for you to make it...

17:30.985 --> 17:34.660
to get your belt.

17:34.722 --> 17:37.669
And you surprised me
by giving me much more.

17:37.725 --> 17:39.898
The way you handled
your disappointment...

17:39.960 --> 17:43.339
makes me prouder than
lever imagined, Walter.

17:43.397 --> 17:45.809
You have become a man...

17:45.866 --> 17:48.506
and I'm just so happy
to be your dad.

17:50.237 --> 17:53.582
- To Walter Grady.
- To Walter Grady.

17:58.754 --> 18:01.098
Out to Walter Grady.
Ten seconds left.

18:01.156 --> 18:04.729
Nine, eight, seven-
He's driving up. He's in the paint.

18:04.793 --> 18:08.900
Five, four, three, two-
He's going up!

18:08.964 --> 18:11.137
- Buzzer shot! And he makes it.
- Oh!

18:11.200 --> 18:14.511
All right, you guys. If I make it,
you have to wash my car.

18:14.570 --> 18:16.880
If I don't make it,
you still have to wash my car.

18:16.939 --> 18:18.885
- No! No.
- No way.

18:19.875 --> 18:21.855
- Oh!
- Doesn't matter anyway.

18:21.910 --> 18:23.856
- Where's your dad?
- Inside getting ready.

18:23.912 --> 18:25.858
- Let's go.
- Bye, Mr. Lee. See you later.

18:25.914 --> 18:27.757
- See you later john.
- See you, john.

18:27.816 --> 18:31.491
Aah! Aah.

18:31.553 --> 18:35.365
Hey, Alex!
Your sauce is burning.

18:36.358 --> 18:39.032
Look at this.

18:39.094 --> 18:43.338
You know, Walter, you have a great dad,
but he can't cook spaghetti.

18:43.398 --> 18:46.004
Humor him.
He thinks it's my favorite.

18:46.068 --> 18:48.014
- Hey, Alex.
- Coming.

18:48.070 --> 18:50.311
- Hey, man, do I look good or what?
- You look marvelous.

18:50.372 --> 18:53.012
New haircut, new shirt on-
My sauce.

18:54.009 --> 18:55.613
- Hey, Walter?
- Yeah?

18:55.677 --> 18:57.315
- Hungry?
- Always.

18:57.379 --> 18:59.484
How does pasta Alexander sound?

18:59.548 --> 19:03.496
Like you're trying to make up
for not taking me to dinner.

19:04.486 --> 19:06.488
Could be some truth to that.

19:06.555 --> 19:09.195
All right, Walter, I made a little extra
for Martha in case she's-

19:09.258 --> 19:12.171
Dad, I gotta talk to you
about Martha.

19:12.227 --> 19:15.037
What's the matter? You don't like her?
I thought you liked her.

19:15.097 --> 19:18.601
Oh, yeah, she's great.
But she's not coming tonight.

19:18.667 --> 19:22.376
Did she cancel?
I can't get another sitter this late.

19:22.437 --> 19:24.781
You see, I called her
and canceled.

19:26.942 --> 19:28.888
You what?

19:28.944 --> 19:31.618
Dad, I don't need
a babysitter anymore.

19:31.680 --> 19:34.718
Walter, you are 11 years old.

19:34.783 --> 19:38.253
Dad, picture this scene.
A guy breaks into the house.

19:38.320 --> 19:41.529
Martha freaks, runs screaming
into the closet, and I kick his butt.

19:41.590 --> 19:43.900
Dad, you said it yourself

19:43.959 --> 19:46.838
I'm a man now, and real men
don't need babysitters.

19:48.830 --> 19:50.776
Oh, man.

19:50.832 --> 19:54.302
I gotta pass, man. I got
no one to stay with Walter.

19:54.369 --> 19:57.680
Great. I'll take 'em both out.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.980
Yeah. All right, look.

20:00.042 --> 20:03.819
This is not an option.

20:03.879 --> 20:06.390
Travis is on his way over
here to drop off some

20:06.416 --> 20:08.717
stuff before he goes
to his bowling league.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.025
So you tell him to take you with him.
Understood?

20:11.051 --> 20:11.619
Got it.

20:11.653 --> 20:14.862
Okay. Hang this up.

20:16.224 --> 20:18.534
Tommy, we're outta here.

20:21.530 --> 20:24.067
- See you later.
- Stay away from the Playboy channel.

20:38.180 --> 20:41.753
Travis, Dad said
I have to go with you.

20:41.817 --> 20:44.058
Sorry, little buddy. Bad news.

20:44.119 --> 20:46.656
Can't go bowling tonight.
Somethin' came up.

20:46.722 --> 20:50.295
But you can't leave me here alone.
I don't even have a babysitter.

20:50.359 --> 20:53.340
What if a serial killer
broke into the house?

20:55.931 --> 20:58.002
- Get in.
- You sure?

20:58.066 --> 21:00.068
Get in.

21:02.704 --> 21:04.706
Thanks, Travis.

21:04.773 --> 21:07.379
Put your seat belt on.

21:07.442 --> 21:09.630
- Walter, there's somethin'
I gotta tell you.

21:10.645 --> 21:13.091
But you gotta keep it
to yourself now, you hear?

21:13.148 --> 21:17.290
You hear me?
I'm fighting tonight.

21:17.352 --> 21:21.664
It's not the kind of fighting
that we-what we're used to.

21:24.893 --> 21:28.898
At the Coliseum,
there are no rules.

21:28.964 --> 21:30.966
Are you kidding?

21:31.033 --> 21:34.845
Tommy and Dad would freak out if they
knew we were even going near that place.

21:34.903 --> 21:38.146
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Walter. What do you
mean, “we“? You're staying in the car.

21:38.206 --> 21:40.152
Come on. You can sneak me in.

21:40.208 --> 21:43.917
No can do, little buddy.
This'll take me a couple hours, tops.

21:45.914 --> 21:48.451
Dad's not gonna
wanna hear about this.

21:48.517 --> 21:50.963
And you're not gonna
tell him, Walter.

21:51.019 --> 21:53.329
Might slip.

21:55.023 --> 21:57.162
You're blackmailing me, Walter.

21:57.225 --> 21:59.535
That's correct.

22:00.662 --> 22:03.666
You are bad.

22:04.666 --> 22:07.510
Thank you.

22:09.571 --> 22:11.517
Take a good look
at this place, Walter...

22:11.573 --> 22:15.316
'cause after tonight's fight,
it's gonna be mine.

22:26.288 --> 22:28.768
Hey, Travis. Why don't you go in
the front door?

22:28.824 --> 22:31.771
Got a buddy with me. I think it's better
he comes in this entrance.

22:31.827 --> 22:34.535
Okay. Oh.

22:41.470 --> 22:44.542
- Sparring partner.
- Yeah.

22:49.945 --> 22:53.586
- Who's the midget?
- He's my manager.

22:55.884 --> 22:57.693
- Look out for him.
- You got it.

22:58.753 --> 23:00.596
Travis.

23:00.655 --> 23:02.760
Showtime.

23:12.267 --> 23:14.247
Wow.

23:26.824 --> 23:30.362
Ladies and gentlemen.

23:34.131 --> 23:37.578
Tonight is a very special night.

23:37.635 --> 23:40.206
We have a challenger.

23:42.873 --> 23:47.413
Straight from a stunning victory
over Andre Marais.

23:47.478 --> 23:52.223
Ladies and gentlemen, the challenger,
a member of the U.S. National Karate Team.

23:52.283 --> 23:57.323
Give a big Coliseum welcome
to Mr. Travis Brickiey!

24:03.828 --> 24:06.069
Right here. The fat guy.

24:06.130 --> 24:09.009
Hey, smut!
The disco's upstairs!

24:10.468 --> 24:12.470
BOO!

24:13.838 --> 24:16.944
Ladies and gentlemen...

24:17.007 --> 24:22.150
the ultimate warrior
who has never known defeat...

24:22.213 --> 24:25.353
the master and owner
of the Coliseum...

24:25.416 --> 24:30.889
the champion of the underworld...

24:30.955 --> 24:33.367
Brakus!

24:46.237 --> 24:49.241
Brakus! Brakus!

24:54.078 --> 24:56.991
Now, remember,
when you hear the buzzer...

24:57.047 --> 25:00.460
there is only one rule.

25:00.518 --> 25:02.998
There are no rules.

25:03.053 --> 25:05.158
And you love it! Yes!

25:10.294 --> 25:14.436
♪  Fighters, to your comers.

25:14.498 --> 25:20.039
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Coliseum!

25:40.090 --> 25:42.195
Come on!
Is that all you've got?

25:46.831 --> 25:50.438
No.

26:55.699 --> 26:58.578
You gotta stop it.
You gotta stop the fight.

26:58.636 --> 27:01.139
Take it easy, kid.
Just part of the show.

27:29.333 --> 27:33.941
In the tradition of the Coliseum,
you privileged few must decide:

27:34.004 --> 27:36.450
Life or death.

27:36.507 --> 27:39.044
Brakus! Brakus!

27:39.109 --> 27:41.282
Does he live?

27:51.956 --> 27:53.958
Or does he die?

27:54.024 --> 27:57.335
Die! Die!

27:59.730 --> 28:01.801
No!

28:16.380 --> 28:18.883
Damn it!

28:22.218 --> 28:25.290
- Payoff of the slots is better.
- Oh, yes. Whoo.

28:39.935 --> 28:42.176
What's the matter, kid?

28:42.238 --> 28:44.445
Need a ride somewhere?

29:10.666 --> 29:12.668
What's the matter?

29:12.735 --> 29:17.081
- I should've been back a long time ago.
- Oh, yeah. I know. I know.

29:17.139 --> 29:18.948
Dad!

29:19.008 --> 29:21.318
I don't know, Alex. Maybe
we should go to the police.

29:21.377 --> 29:23.914
And tell 'em what?
We can't find our friend?

29:25.447 --> 29:28.394
Tomorrow, when you park a car-

29:28.450 --> 29:31.124
Yo, yo, yo.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

29:31.186 --> 29:33.996
I got a couple of men just cruised
through the front door here.

29:39.862 --> 29:41.933
Hey. Guys. Can I help you?

29:41.997 --> 29:44.978
- Are you the manager?
- Yes, Weldon Dardano.

29:45.034 --> 29:47.393
We're looking for a friend
who fought here tonight.

29:47.419 --> 29:48.370
Travis Brickiey.

29:48.404 --> 29:51.146
There's gotta be some mistake.
This is a dance club.

29:51.206 --> 29:54.483
Travis Brickley doesn't dance.

29:56.078 --> 29:58.786
I said this is a dance club,
period.

29:58.847 --> 30:02.351
Travis Brickley fought here tonight,
and we would like to see him.

30:02.418 --> 30:06.798
A lot people come and go. Now, maybe
your friend was here, maybe he wasn't.

30:06.855 --> 30:09.199
- This is bullshit.
- I'm sorry?

30:09.258 --> 30:11.135
This is bullshit.

30:13.529 --> 30:16.066
Look, guys, your
friend did fight here

30:16.092 --> 30:18.367
tonight, but he is
no longer here.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.880
- What are you saying?
- Well, he got his bell rung pretty good...

30:20.936 --> 30:24.042
got his face messed up a little bit,
but he did walk out of here...

30:24.106 --> 30:28.452
on his own two legs with some bimbo
with her tongue in his ear.

30:28.510 --> 30:30.820
- Yeah.
- I put him in a cab and sent him home.

30:30.879 --> 30:32.825
- I'm sure he'll be fine. Don't worry.
- Thanks.

30:32.881 --> 30:34.883
- Pleasure.
- Yeah.

30:36.151 --> 30:38.153
See you.

30:39.321 --> 30:41.371
Finch.

30:41.372 --> 30:42.453
Finch.

30:44.675 --> 30:45.410
What'd he say?

30:45.436 --> 30:48.375
Everything is groovy. They
put Travis in a cab home.

30:48.412 --> 30:52.121
He's lying, Dad. I saw it.
The big guy broke his neck.

30:52.182 --> 30:54.685
Walter, maybe he
just got knocked out.

30:54.752 --> 30:57.323
- Come on. Get in the car.
- He's dead. I know it.

30:57.388 --> 31:00.392
Walter, he's not dead.
Now get in the car.

31:02.393 --> 31:04.339
How you doing, Mr. Finch?

31:04.395 --> 31:08.002
Never better johnny boy.
Never better.

31:10.868 --> 31:12.099
Travis and a bimbo.

31:12.125 --> 31:15.364
Let's take Walter home,
then go find Travis.

31:48.211 --> 31:50.555
Where are you, Travis?

32:17.073 --> 32:17.497
Tommy.

32:17.523 --> 32:19.192
Back it up.
Tell that ambulance to back it up.

32:19.218 --> 32:20.341
Tell that ambulance
to back it up.

32:20.376 --> 32:21.681
So it was an accident?

32:21.707 --> 32:24.315
We're investigating,
but it looks like that.

32:24.347 --> 32:26.793
Thank you, Sergeant.

32:26.849 --> 32:31.298
- Alex.
- Tommy. Tommy, what the hell happened?

32:31.354 --> 32:34.096
We're lifting this thing now.

32:39.161 --> 32:42.165
The police are saying
it's an accident.

32:47.236 --> 32:50.274
Oh, Travis.

32:58.214 --> 33:03.288
Tommy, we gotta do something.

33:05.921 --> 33:08.697
He]!

33:09.759 --> 33:12.865
Jesus! What is this?

33:12.928 --> 33:15.599
They just pulled our
friend out of the river.

33:15.625 --> 33:16.901
What do you want?

33:16.932 --> 33:20.539
I want the man who killed
Travis Brickley.

33:20.603 --> 33:24.210
I told you guys before, Travis walked
out of here on his own two legs.

33:24.273 --> 33:28.221
Now the fact he went somewhere else
and got all screwed up is not my problem.

33:29.545 --> 33:31.650
Yes, it is your problem.

33:31.714 --> 33:34.160
My son witnessed
the whole thing.

33:34.216 --> 33:36.753
Your son?

33:36.819 --> 33:39.060
Your son the witness?

33:39.121 --> 33:42.193
I got 20 witnesses.
I got 5O witnesses.

33:42.258 --> 33:45.762
I don't like you guys very much.
Now get the hell out of here.

33:48.164 --> 33:51.077
Did you kill Travis Brickley?

33:51.133 --> 33:53.374
Easily.

33:53.436 --> 33:55.109
Yeah.

33:58.574 --> 34:01.282
Care to join him?

34:05.915 --> 34:08.521
Ah, you son of a bitch.

34:10.985 --> 34:13.193
Brakus!

34:13.255 --> 34:16.259
Hold up, Brakus.

34:16.324 --> 34:20.068
We don't make any money
like this.

34:20.129 --> 34:23.132
- Clear the path. Let's go. Move it.
- Gus, get in here!

34:23.199 --> 34:25.940
Alex, behind you!

34:26.001 --> 34:28.242
Step aside, please.
Step aside. Let us through!

34:32.041 --> 34:34.954
- Let"s go, boys.
- Where did you get the hat?

34:35.010 --> 34:37.547
It was left to me in a will.

35:02.838 --> 35:05.409
Lie down. How you doing?

35:09.812 --> 35:12.088
Guess you're doing all right.

35:12.148 --> 35:15.152
Behind ya. I'll get the car.

35:23.659 --> 35:26.799
Eh, you're gonna have
a nasty scar there.

35:34.303 --> 35:37.409
There you go.
It's the best I can do.

35:40.643 --> 35:42.589
Shit.

35:42.645 --> 35:47.151
That one who cut my face-
I want him alive.

35:47.216 --> 35:51.187
The other one-
kill him and his boy.

35:53.381 --> 35:57.887
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Amen,.

35:57.952 --> 36:00.432
- Amien.
- Thank you all very much for coming.

36:19.107 --> 36:21.178
Bye, Travis.

36:27.749 --> 36:30.628
- Jammy.
- Hmm?

36:32.220 --> 36:36.100
Bless you, sir. Bless you.

36:36.157 --> 36:38.831
- They heard?
- Hmm.

36:41.963 --> 36:44.637
The Lord be with you, jim.

36:48.302 --> 36:53.513
Dae Han. Thank you for coming.

36:53.574 --> 36:57.784
As your friend,
I share your loss.

36:57.845 --> 37:00.052
Dae Han, it's so good
to see you.

37:00.114 --> 37:02.788
Alex.

37:02.850 --> 37:05.831
- How are you?
- Dane Han, this is my son, Walter.

37:05.887 --> 37:10.302
I remember. You have grown.

37:11.626 --> 37:14.368
Here. You go with Richard,
okay? I'll be with Dae Han.

37:18.266 --> 37:21.770
- And the boy saw it happen?
- Yes, he did.

37:21.836 --> 37:25.807
- Then it is also his tragedy.
- Yes.

37:25.873 --> 37:30.822
- And the police?
- They're treating it as an accident.

37:32.313 --> 37:34.816
Then let me help you.

37:34.882 --> 37:37.021
Blood for blood.

37:37.085 --> 37:39.463
I owe it to you.

37:39.520 --> 37:41.522
I can't ask that
of you, Dae Han.

37:41.589 --> 37:44.502
If not, what will you do?

37:55.670 --> 37:58.617
- Excuse me. When are you on?
- H-Hi.

37:58.673 --> 38:01.313
- When are you on?
- Oh, I can't do it, Alex.

38:01.375 --> 38:04.219
Don't tell me that, Sue.
You know Travis was murdered. Come here.

38:04.278 --> 38:07.316
L- Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

38:07.381 --> 38:09.554
Honey, they shot me down.

38:09.617 --> 38:14.794
I'm a sportscaster, you know.
I'm not an investigative reporter.

38:14.856 --> 38:16.927
Well, if I'm gonna make
allegations like these...

38:16.991 --> 38:19.437
I'm gonna have to go through
their proper procedure.

38:19.494 --> 38:22.566
And without proof, well-
I don't have any.

38:22.630 --> 38:24.610
Appropriate procedure?

38:26.467 --> 38:27.311
Thirty seconds, Sue.

38:27.337 --> 38:29.405
Honey, I gotta-l gotta
go on the air, okay?

38:31.005 --> 38:33.508
Uh, we'll talk about this
later, all right?

38:33.574 --> 38:36.555
A friend of mine was murdered,
and you're worried about your job.

38:36.611 --> 38:41.082
Well, yes, I'm worried abut my job.
It's the only one I have.

38:41.149 --> 38:44.096
But that doesn't mean I don't care
about what happened to Travis.

38:44.152 --> 38:47.690
What, you think it's all about Travis?
What about Walter, Sue?

38:47.755 --> 38:50.702
What do you mean, Walter?

38:50.758 --> 38:53.466
You want me to tell my son
it doesn't matter what he saw...

38:53.528 --> 38:55.633
because his word isn't
good enough for you.

38:55.696 --> 38:59.041
- Ten seconds, Sue.
- Alex, please. Uh-Please.

38:59.100 --> 39:01.137
Walter was there,
and that's good enough for me, honey.

39:01.202 --> 39:03.222
And you know what else?
I couldn't care

39:03.248 --> 39:05.266
less about your
appropriate procedures.

39:05.306 --> 39:07.946
- Five, four, three, two-
- Don't do this. Please, Alex.

39:08.009 --> 39:11.286
- [Buzzer Sounds
- Or your goddamn job.

39:12.580 --> 39:15.461
It's been a busy day
in the world of sports.

40:28.052 --> 40:30.430
Over there!
All right, there he goes. There he goes.

40:31.989 --> 40:34.026
Come on, man. Step on it.

41:04.255 --> 41:06.895
There were three of 'em,
Dad, in a big black car.

41:06.958 --> 41:10.929
He's just a kid, man.
I'm going after them.

41:10.995 --> 41:13.236
Alex, wait a minute.

41:13.297 --> 41:15.743
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

41:16.534 --> 41:18.411
Alex!

41:19.937 --> 41:21.917
Walter, get down!

41:34.885 --> 41:36.831
- Walter!
- Dad!

41:36.887 --> 41:38.889
Come here.

41:45.730 --> 41:48.176
Dad!

41:50.101 --> 41:52.377
Freeze, asshole!

41:52.436 --> 41:54.814
Stand up. I said, get up!

41:54.872 --> 41:57.045
All the way up.

41:57.108 --> 41:59.110
'Got him! 'Got him!

42:02.313 --> 42:04.373
You wanna shoot me? Huh?
Shoot me now. Shoot.

42:04.399 --> 42:05.876
No. No, I don't want to. No.

42:05.916 --> 42:07.862
Punk.

42:38.449 --> 42:42.226
You came into my house.
You came into my fucking house.

42:44.722 --> 42:47.396
Dad!

42:47.458 --> 42:49.529
Don't kill me, man.
Don't kill me.

42:49.593 --> 42:54.064
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy. We'll-Tommy,
I gotta get Walter out of here. Come on.

42:54.131 --> 42:56.737
Come on. Come on.

43:18.355 --> 43:21.928
What do you mean
they vanished into thin air?

43:21.992 --> 43:26.338
Brakus, there's no one
more surprised than me.

43:26.397 --> 43:30.777
Find them. Bring me
the one who did this.

43:30.835 --> 43:32.837
Do you understand?

43:32.903 --> 43:35.281
Yeah, I understand.

43:35.339 --> 43:37.376
I understand.

44:02.963 --> 44:04.909
Fill 'er up.

44:10.437 --> 44:14.408
- Tommy.
- Grandma.

44:14.474 --> 44:15.209
Grandma?

44:15.235 --> 44:18.174
I'll tell you later. Come on.
Grab your gear.

44:20.781 --> 44:23.125
Come, meet my friends. Come on.

44:24.351 --> 44:26.661
Grandma, I'd like you
to meet my closest friend.

44:26.720 --> 44:28.666
- Alexander Grady.
- Hello.

44:28.722 --> 44:30.668
- This is my son, Walter Grady.
- Hello.

44:30.724 --> 44:33.864
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you. Here. Let me help you.

44:36.563 --> 44:40.101
- So she's the one who raised you, huh?
- Yeah, she's the one.

44:41.868 --> 44:46.408
So, Grandma, I thought this would be
the safest place to come.

44:46.473 --> 44:50.285
- You were lucky.
- Thank you for taking us in.

44:50.343 --> 44:53.654
I think you should
talk to james.

44:55.082 --> 44:59.121
- He's back?
- Two months.

44:59.186 --> 45:01.689
- Who's james?
- I don't want to see him...

45:01.755 --> 45:03.792
and I don't wanna talk to him.

45:03.857 --> 45:05.803
He can help you.

45:05.859 --> 45:10.865
- Who's james?
- Grandma, he can't even help himself.

45:10.931 --> 45:15.209
- Who's james?
- He needs you, Tommy.

45:15.268 --> 45:19.273
I'm sorry, Grandma,
but it's too late for that.

45:19.339 --> 45:21.861
Excuse me.

45:21.862 --> 45:21.896
Excuse me.

45:21.995 --> 45:24.703
Who's james?

45:32.839 --> 45:35.479
James.

45:35.542 --> 45:37.647
Wake up.

45:41.982 --> 45:45.156
Well.

45:45.218 --> 45:47.323
Look who's here.

45:49.389 --> 45:53.997
- What are you doing here, boy?
- James, Tommy's got trouble.

45:54.060 --> 45:56.301
I said you could help him.

46:13.413 --> 46:16.758
Just like old times, huh, boy?

46:16.817 --> 46:20.026
Still runnin' to Ma
to fix your problems, huh?

46:22.088 --> 46:24.830
- What did you say?
- Tommy, be cool.

46:24.891 --> 46:26.962
- What did you say? Huh?
- Be cool. - Oh, come on.

46:27.027 --> 46:29.735
Show me your stuff.

46:31.464 --> 46:35.344
Let's see if you've learned
anything in the last 16 years.

46:35.402 --> 46:38.315
I don't fight drunks.

46:38.371 --> 46:41.909
Drunk? This is nothin'.

46:44.778 --> 46:47.884
Right here.
Give me your best shot.

46:47.948 --> 46:50.724
James.

46:50.784 --> 46:56.063
I'll rip your fuckin' ears
right off your goddamn head!

46:56.122 --> 46:59.569
Then I'll stick 'em right
where the sun don't shine...

46:59.626 --> 47:01.867
so you can hear me
kick your butt.

47:01.928 --> 47:03.930
Let's get out of here, man.

47:03.997 --> 47:05.999
Can you believe this shit?

47:06.066 --> 47:08.307
You damn-

47:08.368 --> 47:09.745
- You son of a bitch.
- No! Don't!

47:09.803 --> 47:13.307
Hey, hey! Hey! What's going on?

47:13.373 --> 47:15.148
I'm gonna kick your-

47:15.208 --> 47:17.381
- Let's get some cookies.
- Cookies? What-

47:17.444 --> 47:19.219
- Cookies.
- Inside, Walter.

47:19.279 --> 47:23.227
- Oh, come on. I wanna see this.
- Come on. Come on, you candy-ass!

47:23.283 --> 47:26.389
Cut the crap James.
We're not kids anymore.

47:26.453 --> 47:28.433
Come on.
Show me your stuff, boy.

47:28.488 --> 47:30.434
If you've got any.

47:30.490 --> 47:33.164
What is the matter with you?

47:39.132 --> 47:42.079
James, I'm gonna
have to hurt you, man.

47:48.541 --> 47:52.512
Pretty good. But you're gonna
have to do better than that, boy.

48:07.427 --> 48:10.636
You got a little snap
in those kicks, ain't ya?

48:25.211 --> 48:27.782
- Are you all right?
- Damn, that hurt. Ow.

48:27.847 --> 48:29.793
What the hell was that about?

48:29.849 --> 48:32.420
Come on. I'll take both
you bastards out.

48:32.485 --> 48:34.556
Let's get him.

48:34.621 --> 48:37.261
Mmm. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

48:37.324 --> 48:40.396
Oh.

48:54.975 --> 48:56.921
Now.

48:56.977 --> 48:58.923
Come on.

48:58.979 --> 49:01.721
- You're out of your mind.
- Come on. I'll take both of you on.

49:01.781 --> 49:03.852
You're out of
your goddamn mind.

49:06.086 --> 49:08.965
Oh, to hell with you.

49:14.427 --> 49:17.931
- Here, Walter. Grab some plates.
- Okay.

49:20.400 --> 49:23.176
James ran with
a real bad crowd.

49:24.604 --> 49:27.050
Always fighting for
the wrong reasons.

49:28.708 --> 49:32.315
Then one day,
he just took off?

49:32.379 --> 49:35.383
Went overseas to fight.

49:35.448 --> 49:37.485
He left without
ever saying good-bye.

49:38.551 --> 49:40.553
Took Grandma's life savings.

49:40.620 --> 49:43.032
And I won't forgive him
for that.

49:45.725 --> 49:47.671
I'm sorry.

49:50.397 --> 49:53.003
Was he a good fighter?

49:53.066 --> 49:55.706
We heard
he won some tournaments.

49:55.769 --> 49:57.840
But then he had
a terrible car accident...

49:57.904 --> 49:59.850
almost died.

50:01.641 --> 50:04.815
And his life
pretty much fell apart.

50:34.326 --> 50:39.776
Four, five, six, seven-

50:51.310 --> 50:53.984
Ooh.

50:54.046 --> 50:56.720
What's up, handsome?

50:56.782 --> 50:58.728
How much longer are we
gonna stay here?

50:58.784 --> 51:02.732
Oh, I don't know.
Till we're done training.

51:04.590 --> 51:06.592
What's up?

51:07.593 --> 51:09.630
I watch you training, Dad...

51:09.695 --> 51:13.541
and I know either you're gonna kill Brakus,
or he's gonna kill you.

51:13.599 --> 51:17.103
No one's gonna kill me.
I promise.

51:17.169 --> 51:19.615
I saw him kill Travis, Dad.

51:19.672 --> 51:22.551
I watched him die.

51:22.608 --> 51:24.781
I know it, Walter.

51:24.843 --> 51:28.086
And I have to protect
other people from Brakus.

51:28.147 --> 51:30.855
It's like a war.

51:30.916 --> 51:32.918
Like a war.

51:34.853 --> 51:36.855
Are you afraid?

51:38.324 --> 51:40.326
Yes.

51:52.271 --> 51:54.478
Are you gonna help Tommy?

51:54.540 --> 51:57.111
Yeah. Yeah.

51:57.176 --> 51:59.213
I'm gonna help the boy.

51:59.278 --> 52:01.383
It'd be my pleasure.

52:01.447 --> 52:04.860
Here. Here.

52:06.986 --> 52:11.162
There's a dollar.
Give him that for a bowl of soup.

52:13.792 --> 52:17.968
I know what happened to you
and what you think it cost you.

52:18.030 --> 52:21.034
But the son who left me many years ago
in search of his manhood...

52:21.100 --> 52:25.071
returned home a drunk
and self-pitying overgrown child.

52:25.137 --> 52:28.675
You are a terrible example
for our people...

52:28.741 --> 52:32.188
and a disgrace to your mother.

52:32.244 --> 52:36.784
You have an opportunity now
to do something good.

52:40.219 --> 52:43.598
Help Tommy or pack your bags.

52:53.132 --> 52:55.134
Walter?

52:56.768 --> 52:58.770
- Walter?
- Yeah?

53:01.707 --> 53:04.813
Help me with the chicken feed,
will you?

53:04.877 --> 53:06.879
Sure.

53:08.847 --> 53:10.849
This is pretty cool.

53:25.464 --> 53:28.468
Oh!

53:30.269 --> 53:33.910
- Good morning, Mom.
- Good morning James.

53:33.972 --> 53:36.578
- Where are they?
- Out back.

53:48.520 --> 53:52.730
- Tommy, Alex.
- This is a private conversation.

53:52.791 --> 53:55.635
Not on my mother's property
it's not.

53:58.697 --> 54:00.836
You know,
I'm tired of your shit.

54:00.899 --> 54:02.901
Tommy.

54:06.038 --> 54:09.645
Ma told me about your problem,
sol came out here to help.

54:10.742 --> 54:13.621
I know Brakus.
I've seen him fight.

54:15.314 --> 54:18.989
How you're gonna fight him,
you must be prepared to die.

54:21.320 --> 54:24.199
- You think I'm just a drunk.
- You are a drunk.

54:26.892 --> 54:30.203
Yes, I am.

54:31.463 --> 54:34.535
But I am one of three people
in the whole world...

54:34.600 --> 54:37.206
that can teach you
to beat Brakus.

54:37.269 --> 54:39.681
- You're full of it.
- Tommy!

54:39.738 --> 54:42.309
- What?
- Remember the accident?

54:42.374 --> 54:44.684
Yeah. So what?

54:46.044 --> 54:48.320
Brakus was the car.

54:48.380 --> 54:50.382
I was the accident.

54:50.449 --> 54:54.864
Now, I can train you to beat him
if you're not too proud.

55:08.400 --> 55:11.176
If you ever get past
the preliminaries...

55:11.236 --> 55:13.238
you're gonna have to fight
with these things.

55:21.146 --> 55:24.753
Pick it up.

55:24.816 --> 55:28.229
Not with your hands. Like this.

55:35.794 --> 55:37.796
All right.
Now let's see what you got.

55:37.863 --> 55:40.537
- What do you want me to do?
- Attack!

55:42.934 --> 55:46.347
Okay.

55:50.275 --> 55:52.778
We got a long way to go, kid.

56:27.813 --> 56:32.057
One of them.
Don't disappoint me.

56:32.117 --> 56:35.462
Bring me Tommy Lee, alive.

56:47.837 --> 56:49.646
- Go on in.
- Excuse me?

56:49.705 --> 56:53.482
- Go on in.
- Why?

56:53.542 --> 56:55.920
- It's part of your trainin'.
- Oh.

56:55.978 --> 56:58.584
- Come on, gentlemen. Let's go.
- Okay.

56:58.647 --> 57:01.685
U h, Tom my, after you.

57:18.334 --> 57:23.977
It's too hot. I can't breathe.

57:25.941 --> 57:27.887
Tommy, I'll see you outside.

57:27.943 --> 57:32.790
Alex, Brakus would stay...

57:32.848 --> 57:35.556
even if it meant dying.

57:40.356 --> 57:44.133
The sweat lodge is a church.

57:44.193 --> 57:49.336
The heat drives the body temperature
way up like a fever.

57:49.398 --> 57:54.973
Sometimes you may have
what the white men cal! Hallucinations.

57:55.037 --> 57:58.211
We call them visions...

57:58.274 --> 58:00.948
messages from the spirits.

59:02.371 --> 59:04.408
Go ahead, Walter, Take it.

59:08.911 --> 59:11.983
- What is it?
- It's a snake charm.

59:13.082 --> 59:16.757
A snake can take a life
or save a life.

59:16.819 --> 59:18.765
It's to protect you.

59:18.821 --> 59:21.358
I don't get it.
Is this a riddle?

59:21.423 --> 59:24.927
It's a symbol of courage.
Do you know what courage is?

59:24.994 --> 59:26.940
Sure. When you're not afraid.

59:26.996 --> 59:30.603
No, courage is not
the absence of fear.

59:30.666 --> 59:34.739
It's doing what's right
even in the presence of fear.

59:36.939 --> 59:40.182
Sometimes you just
gotta kick butt.

01:00:53.469 --> 01:00:55.847
You men have done a good job.

01:00:57.273 --> 01:01:01.380
But now I think you're ready
for a higher level of training.

01:01:01.444 --> 01:01:04.857
So pack your stuff,
and you get a good night's sleep.

01:01:04.914 --> 01:01:07.326
Then tomorrow
we begin our journey.

01:01:24.706 --> 01:01:28.244
Easy Easy.

01:01:29.544 --> 01:01:31.820
Come on. Let me see your hands.

01:01:34.482 --> 01:01:37.622
Slow. Slow.

01:01:50.698 --> 01:01:53.440
Okay, we've got 'em.
Come on in.

01:02:16.357 --> 01:02:18.735
Come on.
Get the lead out, chief.

01:02:19.727 --> 01:02:24.233
Let's finish this up, finally.

01:02:32.273 --> 01:02:34.446
Get down, goddamn it!

01:02:43.451 --> 01:02:47.058
ﬂames!
Move, and <i>I'll</i> pop her a third eyeball.

01:03:18.453 --> 01:03:20.933
Now, all of you, get up.

01:03:29.063 --> 01:03:34.069
Inside. Except you.
Mr. Brakus wants you for himself

01:03:42.243 --> 01:03:44.484
- Gun.
- Inside.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.922
Inside, please.

01:04:03.898 --> 01:04:08.438
Mr. Brakus and Mr. Weldon Dardano
send their regards.

01:04:11.205 --> 01:04:15.051
- Don't kill my son.
- It'll be clean.

01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:17.453
Hurry up. I'm hungry.

01:04:17.512 --> 01:04:20.254
All right. Turn around,
and down on your knees.

01:04:28.790 --> 01:04:31.031
Run it all the way out
to the chopper.

01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:39.168
You, too, kid. Come on. Let's go.
I don't have all day.

01:04:39.233 --> 01:04:41.941
- What, are you deaf, tough guy?
- Courage.

01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:44.244
Or you wanna take it in the face?

01:04:45.573 --> 01:04:49.612
' Dad!

01:04:49.677 --> 01:04:53.352
Where's Gus?

01:04:59.721 --> 01:05:03.168
- It's about time.
- They're expecting four shots.

01:05:24.912 --> 01:05:27.119
Don't you ever touch me!

01:05:27.181 --> 01:05:30.253
- Hey, where's Gus?
- Takin' his sweet time now!

01:05:30.318 --> 01:05:33.629
- I'm gonna go get him.
- No! We're outta here in 3O seconds!

01:05:33.688 --> 01:05:37.101
- Acceptable loss!
- Like hell!

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.644
Can I, Mr. Finch?

01:05:48.703 --> 01:05:50.774
Let me do it.

01:05:57.178 --> 01:05:59.180
Blaze 'em!

01:06:05.086 --> 01:06:08.260
Aw, shit!

01:06:37.018 --> 01:06:40.295
I always told Gus
smoking would kill him.

01:06:42.623 --> 01:06:45.069
Let's ﬂy!

01:07:23.231 --> 01:07:25.233
All right. Take my hand.

01:07:25.299 --> 01:07:27.301
Then Grandma. Come on.

01:07:31.405 --> 01:07:33.407
Jesus!

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:41.153
Son of a bitch!

01:07:44.218 --> 01:07:46.596
Son of a bitch!

01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:58.704
Grandma, I'm so sorry.

01:08:00.368 --> 01:08:02.644
I'm so sorry.

01:08:02.997 --> 01:08:05.910
Enough!

01:08:08.002 --> 01:08:10.346
I said, enough!

01:08:12.073 --> 01:08:16.953
My, my. He is interesting.

01:08:18.112 --> 01:08:21.184
I believe you two
have met before.

01:08:23.184 --> 01:08:27.962
Tommy Lee, thank you
for joining us.

01:08:28.022 --> 01:08:31.970
- Do you know why you're still alive?
- I really don't give a shit.

01:08:32.026 --> 01:08:37.100
You challenged my invincibility,
scarred my perfection.

01:08:37.165 --> 01:08:41.272
For that I will kill you
in the ring.

01:08:41.335 --> 01:08:45.044
- Let's do it here, now.
- Excuse me. What-

01:08:45.106 --> 01:08:47.848
What Mr. Brakus
was trying to say...

01:08:47.908 --> 01:08:50.354
is that you're gonna have to
work your way up the ladder...

01:08:50.411 --> 01:08:52.720
just like everybody else.

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:54.885
And when you're finished
with the gladiators...

01:08:54.948 --> 01:08:57.828
and then Mr. Brakus
finishes with you...

01:08:57.885 --> 01:09:00.832
the last thing through your mind
will be your ass.

01:09:02.290 --> 01:09:04.462
Curtain's going up
in a few hours.

01:09:04.524 --> 01:09:06.835
Show business is my life.

01:09:06.894 --> 01:09:10.432
- Later.
- Get him to the Coliseum.

01:09:10.497 --> 01:09:12.808
Poor baby.

01:09:41.028 --> 01:09:45.340
Now, I realize that I didn't give you
time to study for this test.

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:47.777
But here it is.
How many of you believe...

01:09:47.835 --> 01:09:51.840
that a martial artist could defeat
a world champion boxer?

01:09:51.906 --> 01:09:55.115
How many believe yes?

01:09:55.176 --> 01:09:58.714
How many believe no?

01:10:02.383 --> 01:10:06.160
Okay. Well,
I say let's find out.

01:10:08.356 --> 01:10:12.498
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing...

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.562
our champion martial artist...

01:10:14.629 --> 01:10:16.905
Tommy Lee!

01:10:28.242 --> 01:10:32.884
And European boxing champion...

01:10:32.947 --> 01:10:34.984
The Hammer!

01:10:49.964 --> 01:10:51.966
Now, I thought The Hammer
was a rapper.

01:10:52.033 --> 01:10:54.274
What do I know?

01:10:56.904 --> 01:11:02.377
Now, remember, when the buzzer sounds,
there is only one rule.

01:11:02.443 --> 01:11:05.720
- There are no rules!
- And you love it!

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.386
Yeah!

01:11:11.319 --> 01:11:16.200
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Coliseum!

01:11:44.518 --> 01:11:46.259
Damn!

01:11:48.656 --> 01:11:52.365
Ladies and gentlemen,
what an upset!

01:11:52.426 --> 01:11:55.873
The winner, Tommy Lee!

01:11:55.930 --> 01:11:58.638
A big Coliseum
round of applause!

01:12:02.336 --> 01:12:06.341
- Tommy Lee.
- You lower the gate, now!

01:12:08.843 --> 01:12:10.845
Work with me, man.
Work with me.

01:12:21.989 --> 01:12:24.299
Tommy Lee!

01:12:30.264 --> 01:12:32.870
Aren't we special!

01:12:34.568 --> 01:12:37.344
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next contest will begin shortly.

01:12:37.405 --> 01:12:41.876
Just time enough to go potty
and come back and place your bets.

01:12:41.942 --> 01:12:45.048
Now, this is gonna be
a long night.

01:12:45.112 --> 01:12:48.616
Darling, I thinkyou may have finally
found a worthy opponent.

01:12:53.098 --> 01:12:57.012
Ladies and gentlemen,
our second battle of the evening.

01:12:57.068 --> 01:13:01.574
Tommy Lee versus the man who won
the gold in Olympic wrestling...

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.449
Stavros!

01:13:13.918 --> 01:13:17.058
Come on! Come on!
Kill him! Let's go!

01:13:29.434 --> 01:13:32.608
Tummy, some on'.
Tommy, come on'.!

01:13:54.225 --> 01:13:56.466
It's not over yet!

01:15:03.895 --> 01:15:06.068
Yeah! Come on!

01:17:00.086 --> 01:17:01.759
BOO!

01:17:49.102 --> 01:17:51.275
- Bring on the champ!
- Ladies and gentlemen...

01:17:51.338 --> 01:17:56.151
in the tradition of the Coliseum,
we present only the best.

01:17:56.209 --> 01:18:00.624
If you will, a big round of applause
for our winner, Mr. Tommy Lee.

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:03.627
Come on now. Let's hear it.
Tommy Lee!

01:18:07.153 --> 01:18:09.793
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:18:09.856 --> 01:18:12.769
according to the rules
of the Coliseum...

01:18:14.461 --> 01:18:18.657
Tommy Lee has earned the
right to challenge me.

01:18:20.033 --> 01:18:22.570
I have accepted.

01:18:24.371 --> 01:18:26.373
Tomorrow night...

01:18:27.507 --> 01:18:30.010
only one man...

01:18:30.076 --> 01:18:32.078
will leave the ring.

01:18:35.282 --> 01:18:38.525
I look forward to killing you!

01:18:38.585 --> 01:18:41.998
Don't bet on it.

01:18:48.122 --> 01:18:50.796
Yeah? Yeah? Who is it?

01:18:50.858 --> 01:18:53.361
Open up, Sue. It's me.

01:18:54.394 --> 01:18:58.240
Alex? Alex?

01:18:58.298 --> 01:19:03.611
Oh! Oh! Oh, God, you're alive!

01:19:05.672 --> 01:19:08.585
We'll talk about it later.
We'll talk about it later.

01:19:08.642 --> 01:19:11.748
Yeah. Oh, God,
I was so worried about you.

01:19:11.812 --> 01:19:14.349
- I've been worried sick.
- They got Tommy.

01:19:14.414 --> 01:19:16.724
I heard.

01:19:16.783 --> 01:19:19.024
He's supposed to fight Brakus.

01:19:19.086 --> 01:19:22.226
They'll kill him.
I'm going in after him.

01:19:22.289 --> 01:19:24.963
In the meantime, I need you
to take care Of Walter, all right?

01:19:26.326 --> 01:19:29.307
- Of course I will.
- Dad!

01:19:29.363 --> 01:19:32.503
What? Oh, boy!

01:19:32.566 --> 01:19:35.672
What's the matter? It's okay.

01:19:35.736 --> 01:19:39.183
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I don't-

01:19:42.609 --> 01:19:48.116
- I don't wanna lose you.
- Hey. Hey.

01:19:48.182 --> 01:19:50.662
There's no way in hell
you're gonna lose me.

01:19:50.717 --> 01:19:55.291
I'm gonna go get Tommy, and then Tommy
and I are gonna come get you.

01:19:55.355 --> 01:19:58.700
In the meantime, you stay here.
I'll know you're safe.

01:19:58.759 --> 01:20:01.467
- I want you to do me a favor.
- What?

01:20:01.528 --> 01:20:04.441
- Take care of Sue.
- Okay.

01:20:04.498 --> 01:20:06.500
Okay.

01:20:08.635 --> 01:20:11.138
- Here.
- Huh?

01:20:11.205 --> 01:20:13.845
Grandma said this will
help you kick butt.

01:20:18.078 --> 01:20:21.025
Alex.

01:20:21.081 --> 01:20:23.186
I'm sorry that I let you down.

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:29.763
Come here.

01:20:35.095 --> 01:20:38.099
You've got my boy-

01:20:38.165 --> 01:20:40.338
You think I don't trust you?

01:20:45.839 --> 01:20:47.841
I'll be back in a minute.

01:20:49.710 --> 01:20:52.054
Hey, he saved my life today.

01:20:52.112 --> 01:20:54.353
Let him tell you about it.
Tell her all about it.

01:21:00.719 --> 01:21:04.394
It's easy money. The smart money's
gonna go on Brakus.

01:21:04.456 --> 01:21:07.369
Okay? Believe me.
Put it all on Brakus.

01:21:07.425 --> 01:21:10.770
- How much is there?
- $500,000, my dear.

01:21:10.829 --> 01:21:12.775
Uh, counter, please.

01:22:05.450 --> 01:22:09.990
Hey, tough guy,
Brakus says put this on.

01:22:10.055 --> 01:22:15.061
Yeah. Did you order the, uh,
double security downstairs like I asked?

01:22:15.126 --> 01:22:17.766
Okay, great. Thanks.

01:22:17.829 --> 01:22:21.709
Through the roof! Yes!

01:22:21.766 --> 01:22:24.747
Give me a little kiss. Thanks.

01:22:38.516 --> 01:22:41.463
I ﬂew all the way in
for this fight.

01:22:41.519 --> 01:22:45.990
Got myself a suite of rooms
if you wanna stop on by later.

01:22:46.057 --> 01:22:51.666
Hell, bring your friend, huh?
Hey! Whoo-hoo!

01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:57.271
Hey. Stranger!

01:22:57.335 --> 01:23:00.077
You look like you're
a real stranger in these parts.

01:23:00.138 --> 01:23:03.517
Where the hell are you from
anyway, huh?

01:23:05.043 --> 01:23:07.922
- Houston.
- Houston. Houston!

01:23:11.483 --> 01:23:14.123
Hey, blondie,
come on over here a minute.

01:23:48.598 --> 01:23:51.340
Thank you.

01:23:52.803 --> 01:23:55.545
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:23:55.605 --> 01:24:00.918
I bring you the event
of a lifetime!

01:24:06.283 --> 01:24:10.231
Firstly, our challenger,
vanquisher-

01:24:10.287 --> 01:24:14.083
Vanquisher? He kicked the
shit out of three gladiators!

01:24:17.294 --> 01:24:21.299
Mr. Tommy Lee!

01:24:27.104 --> 01:24:32.782
And the ultimate warrior
who has never known defeat...

01:24:32.843 --> 01:24:37.952
the master and owner
of the Coliseum...

01:24:38.015 --> 01:24:42.122
the champion of the underworld...

01:24:42.185 --> 01:24:45.189
Brakus!

01:25:09.713 --> 01:25:13.490
I have waited a long time
for this, Tommy Lee.

01:25:15.018 --> 01:25:17.430
The feeling is mutual.

01:25:22.793 --> 01:25:27.037
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:25:27.097 --> 01:25:30.271
the Coliseum!

01:26:12.409 --> 01:26:14.411
- What do you want?
- Excuse me.

01:26:14.478 --> 01:26:17.721
- I said, what do you want?
- What do I want?

01:26:17.781 --> 01:26:20.352
Aaah! God!

01:26:20.417 --> 01:26:23.193
Ah, son of a bitch! Ah!

01:27:01.571 --> 01:27:03.517
- Hey, Han.

01:27:03.573 --> 01:27:07.749
- So good to see you.
- G00D' to see you.

01:27:07.810 --> 01:27:10.814
- You guys tryin' to mess up your clothes?
- How about you?

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:12.917
Hey, it's a rental.
Look out. Here they come.

01:27:12.982 --> 01:27:15.053
- There he is, right there.
- Let's do it.

01:27:23.059 --> 01:27:25.699
Ow!

01:27:31.634 --> 01:27:35.343
That's it, Brakus.
Tear his head off!

01:28:26.389 --> 01:28:28.391
Come on.

01:28:43.706 --> 01:28:45.784
Get up, Brakus!

01:29:03.794 --> 01:29:05.740
Hey, watch it!

01:29:05.796 --> 01:29:08.072
- Oh!
- Watch out!

01:29:08.132 --> 01:29:10.612
- You better watch it!
- Hey come on!

01:29:45.469 --> 01:29:48.643
- Sorry, gentlemen.
- Private club.

01:30:05.356 --> 01:30:08.394
Yeah! Yeah!

01:30:23.707 --> 01:30:26.916
Now he's mad.
Now he's gonna get him. Get him!

01:30:42.726 --> 01:30:44.763
How many?

01:30:44.828 --> 01:30:48.298
All of them? All of them?
Where's Finch?

01:30:48.365 --> 01:30:50.868
Get me Finch now, now, now!

01:30:59.376 --> 01:31:02.516
How'd' you get in here?

01:31:13.223 --> 01:31:15.726
Code red downstairs! Let's go!

01:31:28.205 --> 01:31:31.049
- Move it! You!
- Come and get me.

01:31:36.747 --> 01:31:39.660
- You've got a lot of balls.
- Come on.

01:31:59.870 --> 01:32:02.077
Tommy! Tommy!

01:32:02.139 --> 01:32:04.949
Tommy!

01:32:07.044 --> 01:32:10.423
- Hey!
- Four more, Alex.

01:32:10.481 --> 01:32:13.428
Okay. You get them.
I got Tommy.

01:32:49.186 --> 01:32:52.429
The buck stops here, bucko.

01:32:52.489 --> 01:32:55.402
You. I owe you.

01:32:59.830 --> 01:33:01.832
Join your dead friends!

01:33:12.609 --> 01:33:16.853
Tommy!

01:33:22.386 --> 01:33:24.388
Yeah!

01:33:37.501 --> 01:33:40.107
Yeah, yeah!

01:33:54.184 --> 01:33:56.460

Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!

01:34:03.727 --> 01:34:06.173
Kill him! Kill him!

01:34:06.230 --> 01:34:09.507
- No! No! No!
- Dead! Dead! Dead!

01:34:21.812 --> 01:34:24.759
- No! No! No!
- Dead! Dead!

01:34:27.751 --> 01:34:31.494
- Kill him! Kill!
- Dead! Dead!

01:34:38.428 --> 01:34:42.001
Stay down... and live.

01:34:48.939 --> 01:34:50.885
Tommy, look out!

01:35:16.266 --> 01:35:18.530
Ladies and gentlemen-Ladies and

01:35:18.556 --> 01:35:21.172
gentlemen, in
victory, the title...

01:35:21.205 --> 01:35:25.153
and the ownership of the Coliseum
pass to the strongest.

01:35:25.209 --> 01:35:28.486
The new owner and master
of the Coliseum...

01:35:28.545 --> 01:35:32.618
Tommy Lee

01:35:32.683 --> 01:35:36.597
W-Well, you see, the-the champ
is a little new to public speaking.

01:35:36.653 --> 01:35:39.497
Believe me when I tell you,
you're gonna be seeing more of him...

01:35:39.556 --> 01:35:43.936
right here at the Coliseum in the months
and-and the years to come.

01:35:43.994 --> 01:35:48.136
Everybody, come on.
Give him a big Coliseum round of applause.

01:35:48.198 --> 01:35:51.441
Mr. Tommy Lee!

01:35:56.974 --> 01:35:59.386
Say a few things, champ.

01:35:59.443 --> 01:36:02.549
Champ, say a few things.
Champ, this is it.

01:36:02.613 --> 01:36:05.321
You gotta talk to these people.
Say a few things.

01:36:05.382 --> 01:36:08.056
- Do it for me.
- Say something.

01:36:12.789 --> 01:36:17.101
The Coliseum is closed.

01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:20.039
What? Wait a minute.

01:36:20.097 --> 01:36:22.099
Hey,wait a minute!

01:36:22.165 --> 01:36:24.839
Wait! Hey, wait a minute, guys.
You need me.

01:36:24.901 --> 01:36:27.279
You can't do this.
You gotta think this over.

01:36:27.337 --> 01:36:29.377
You gotta think this over.
This is not chicken feed.

01:36:29.439 --> 01:36:31.544
This is 20 million dollars
a year, champ.

01:36:31.608 --> 01:36:35.078
