<i> ALF hosting</i>
<i> "The Tonight Show?"</i>

00:02.870 --> 00:04.703
<i> What a great idea!</i>

00:04.705 --> 00:06.038
<i> Everybody thought so.</i>

00:06.040 --> 00:08.807
<i> Except Johnny.</i>

00:08.809 --> 00:12.378
So, Johnny, have you been
watching the show?

00:12.380 --> 00:13.879
Yeah? What do you think?

00:14.915 --> 00:17.950
Alright, alright,
I'm sorry I broke your cup.

00:19.553 --> 00:22.688
Um, look, Johnny, uh,
I'd love to keep talking

00:22.690 --> 00:25.324
but you know what it's like
here in the big chair.

00:25.326 --> 00:27.659
Yeah, gotta keep
things moving.

00:27.661 --> 00:30.095
Hey, after I'm done,
why don't I come over

00:30.097 --> 00:33.332
and we'll hit
the hot tub together.

00:33.334 --> 00:36.468
Hello? Hello?

00:36.470 --> 00:39.671
[theme music]

01:09.303 --> 01:12.304
[music continues]

01:38.866 --> 01:41.567
Boy, you are in
<i> big</i> trouble, mister.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.702
Oh, hey, this isn't trouble.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.571
I'll show you trouble.

01:45.573 --> 01:48.974
Bobby, roll the clip
marked "Trouble."

01:51.045 --> 01:54.513
- Here, hold this, Willie.
- What is it?

01:54.515 --> 01:56.115
Oh, that's just
nuclear waste

01:56.117 --> 01:57.883
from my spaceship.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.885
[gasps]

01:59.887 --> 02:00.953
Oh, hey, don't worry.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.387
Life on this planet will exist

02:02.389 --> 02:05.657
as long as that little lid
doesn't pop off.

02:09.897 --> 02:12.831
Ah. Oh, wait.
These are my crayons.

02:14.768 --> 02:17.603
Just tell us
why you did it.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.305
- It was Willie's idea.
- What?

02:20.307 --> 02:22.674
Don't try to worm
your way out of this one.

02:22.676 --> 02:23.942
You said we'd build a lagoon.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.645
I said we'd build
a little lagoon

02:26.647 --> 02:30.949
not the Great Tanner Reef!

02:30.951 --> 02:33.051
Okay. Okay, I misunderstood.

02:33.053 --> 02:36.488
I'm sorry.
I made a boo-boo.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.956
A boo-boo?

02:40.561 --> 02:45.497
Say, what are you...doing here?

02:45.499 --> 02:46.932
Greeting the guests.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.734
Hey, Tex, looks like
you're putting on

02:48.736 --> 02:50.469
a little weight there, huh?

02:50.471 --> 02:52.604
Ha! Ha! Ha!

02:52.606 --> 02:53.939
Could I speak with you
in the kitchen

02:53.941 --> 02:54.973
just for a moment?

02:54.975 --> 02:56.642
Hey, not now, Willie.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.477
Your pumpkin's on fire!

02:58.479 --> 03:01.346
Ha! His pumpkin's on fire!

03:01.348 --> 03:02.748
Come here.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.716
Well, who is
this little guy?

03:04.718 --> 03:06.185
Ah, this is Gordon, everyone.

03:06.187 --> 03:09.254
Uh, Gordon's an old friend
of our family.

03:09.256 --> 03:10.889
Bernice, uh, don't mention
his height.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.691
He's very sensitive.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.861
Hey, cowgirl,
nice calves! Ha!

03:15.863 --> 03:19.631
Nice calves! Ha! Ha!

03:19.633 --> 03:20.899
- Yah!
- Unh!

03:23.204 --> 03:27.406
Good morning, America,
how are you?

03:27.408 --> 03:28.640
¶ Don't you know me ¶

03:28.642 --> 03:31.243
¶ I'm your native son ¶¶

03:32.780 --> 03:34.713
What's the next line?

03:34.715 --> 03:37.316
Just be quiet.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.717
Really?

03:38.719 --> 03:42.354
I'm surprised that song
was such a big hit.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.655
¶ Just be quiet ¶

03:43.657 --> 03:47.025
¶ Just be quiet
just be quiet ¶

03:47.027 --> 03:49.161
¶ La la la la la la la ¶¶

03:49.163 --> 03:52.130
A picture's worth
a thousand words.

03:56.971 --> 04:00.505
That picture
was worth a $1000.

04:02.142 --> 04:04.443
Well, maybe the frame
makes it look cheap.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.448
I am tired
of your breaking things.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.983
If this happens
one more time

04:10.985 --> 04:13.752
you will be living
in the garage.

04:13.754 --> 04:18.857
From now on, I'll treat this
house as it if were my own.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.026
Treat it as if
it were my house

04:21.028 --> 04:24.696
and don't break anything.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.331
Cheap frame.

04:27.801 --> 04:31.570
Well, I guess
it can be repaired.

What was ALF running for?

04:45.552 --> 04:46.685
(ALF)
'Uh, occupied.'

04:46.687 --> 04:49.021
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:49.023 --> 04:51.490
ALF knows that's not
a bathroom, doesn't he?

04:51.492 --> 04:53.425
I hope so.

Well, I guess
we'll have to order in.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.396
Hey, that was great!

05:31.398 --> 05:34.066
- Let's show it again.
- Let's not.

05:34.068 --> 05:36.468
Fine.
Well, I've got a better idea.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.870
You think you can hold down
the fort for a minute?

05:38.872 --> 05:40.739
And don't sit in my chair.

05:40.741 --> 05:41.940
I guess
I could fill time

05:41.942 --> 05:44.376
with one of
my live commercials.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.111
Ed, Ed.

05:46.113 --> 05:50.782
This shameless self-promotion
does not become you.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.385
I know. I'll show a clip.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.887
While I leave the room,
you folks watch

05:55.889 --> 05:57.989
these scenes of me
leaving the room.

You know, if you weren't
always sending me

06:05.032 --> 06:08.767
to the kitchen,
I might not eat so much.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.236
ALF, please, please.

06:11.238 --> 06:14.606
No wonder Willie's pants
don't fit me anymore.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.275
[doorbell dings]

06:17.277 --> 06:19.378
ALF, hide in the kitchen.

06:19.380 --> 06:23.215
Yeah. Just call me
Pavlov's alien.

06:24.318 --> 06:25.984
[doorbell dings]

06:25.986 --> 06:27.185
ALF, go into the kitchen.

06:27.187 --> 06:30.055
Go into the kitchen.
Go into the kitchen.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.357
As a woman,
you should be sensitive

06:32.359 --> 06:35.327
to the demeaning undertones
in that remark.

06:35.329 --> 06:37.129
Now!

06:37.131 --> 06:39.464
You're betraying your sisters.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.906
ALF, kitchen.

06:47.908 --> 06:51.009
No problem.
I'll call a cab.

06:51.011 --> 06:54.112
You will walk.
Now.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.882
One day, I'll walk
into that kitchen

06:56.884 --> 06:59.151
and keep right on walking.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.120
(ALF)

(in unison)
ALF, hide in the kitchen.

07:11.031 --> 07:14.433
Oh! Uh, we're back, apparently.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.270
What happened
to the pushy furball?

07:18.272 --> 07:20.405
Who cares?
At least he's gone.

07:20.407 --> 07:23.375
(ALF)
'Yo, point those cameras
over here.'

07:23.377 --> 07:27.012
- Ohh.
- Oh, no, not that.

07:27.014 --> 07:29.481
[instrumental music]

07:29.483 --> 07:33.218
Hey, feature-film freaks,
ALF Fern here.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.619
We'll get right back
to our film.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.555
Burns and Allen,
Burns and Schreiber

07:36.557 --> 07:38.657
Olsen and Johnson,
Johnson and Johnson

07:38.659 --> 07:44.796
and Damp the Musk Ox in "Rin Tin
Tin Makes a Mess, Mess, Mess!"

07:44.798 --> 07:45.997
Friends.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.599
Are you getting too fat
for things

07:47.601 --> 07:48.700
you used to fit in..

07:48.702 --> 07:50.936
...like your house?

07:50.938 --> 07:52.938
When you get on the scale,
does it say

07:52.940 --> 07:55.574
"Get off the elephant first?"

07:55.576 --> 07:59.711
Does your sunken chest appear
on pirate treasure maps?

07:59.713 --> 08:02.747
Then come to our health club

08:02.749 --> 08:04.683
'"Pecs 'R' Us."'

08:04.685 --> 08:07.352
At Pecs 'R' Us,
we'll tone up your muscles

08:07.354 --> 08:09.588
while we slim down your wallet.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.324
At Pecs 'R' Us,
you'll build your biceps

08:12.326 --> 08:15.060
banging on our door
for a refund.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.662
Yes, friends, we've got
barbells and dumbbells.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.297
And speaking of dumbbells

08:19.299 --> 08:22.300
here's our own
matinee lady.

08:22.302 --> 08:25.270
I go to Pecs 'R' Us
and work up a sweat.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.105
Hmm, you work up a sweat

08:27.107 --> 08:30.876
reading the instructions
on a stop sign.

08:30.878 --> 08:33.311
Friends, you say
you want to pump iron?

08:33.313 --> 08:36.882
Well, come to Pecs 'R' Us.

08:36.884 --> 08:40.585
You can start
by pressing my shorts.

08:40.587 --> 08:42.687
We also sell vitamins,
so you can choose

08:42.689 --> 08:44.856
between A, B, C, D, and E.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.324
I prefer E.

08:46.326 --> 08:49.327
No, you can't even spell E.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.796
Friends, if you want
to join Pecs 'R' Us

08:51.798 --> 08:54.099
come on down to our main office.

08:54.101 --> 08:57.435
How do you get there? Hmm!

08:57.437 --> 09:00.839
You take the Golden State
Freeway to the Ventura Freeway

09:00.841 --> 09:04.576
to the San Diego Freeway till
you come to the Slauson cut-off.

09:04.578 --> 09:07.312
Get out of your car,
cut off your Slauson

09:07.314 --> 09:08.780
get back in your car..

09:08.782 --> 09:11.550
...then drive nine more miles
to the neon sign

09:11.552 --> 09:14.319
that says
"Steroids on tap."

09:14.321 --> 09:18.290
That's our main office.

09:18.292 --> 09:20.325
Uh, take that out of my check.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.227
(male #2)
'Consider it done.'

09:22.229 --> 09:24.596
Well, uh, and now,
back to our movie.

09:24.598 --> 09:27.499
Gene Barry, Barry Nelson,
Nelson Eddy, Eddie Albert

09:27.501 --> 09:29.067
and Gotcha the Wonder Goose

09:29.069 --> 09:32.837
in "Minnie Tells Mickey
That Roger Rabbit Died."

09:32.839 --> 09:34.839
[instrumental music]

09:41.848 --> 09:43.315
[instrumental music]

09:49.423 --> 09:50.922
So, how'd you like the bit?

09:50.924 --> 09:54.225
I hope it's as funny
when Johnny does it on Friday.

09:54.227 --> 09:58.263
How could it be?
He doesn't have my delivery.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.999
And he doesn't have
the pointer anymore.

10:01.001 --> 10:04.035
I know, let's talk about
that planet you came from.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.271
What's it called, Tarmac?

10:07.541 --> 10:09.274
Melmac.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.376
And by fortunate coincidence

10:11.378 --> 10:15.046
it's the subject of my next
fascinating set of clips.

10:15.048 --> 10:18.083
Mind if I show them, Oedipus?

10:18.085 --> 10:19.250
Clips.

10:19.252 --> 10:23.688
Sounds like
a nice...change of pace.

10:23.690 --> 10:26.691
I say we fight violence
with violence.

10:26.693 --> 10:29.227
That's how we solve things
back home.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.062
But, ALF, don't you remember

10:31.064 --> 10:32.831
what happened to your planet?

10:32.833 --> 10:37.102
Well, it blew up in
a nuclear holocaust. Why?

10:37.104 --> 10:39.471
Don't you see the connection?

10:41.074 --> 10:43.408
What connection?

10:43.410 --> 10:46.144
- I give up.
- Me too.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.580
I'm gonna lie down.
My head is spinning.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.982
What are you guys doing?

10:50.984 --> 10:53.418
Trading bouillabaseball cards.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.353
What's bouillabaseball?

10:55.355 --> 10:56.688
It's baseball on Melmac.

10:56.690 --> 11:00.091
Instead of a ball,
they throw fish guts.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.493
Fish parts.

11:01.495 --> 11:04.596
The guts are sold
at the concession stand.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.435
Oh, football.
Can I watch too?

11:10.437 --> 11:12.904
Oh, ALF, last time
we watched football together

11:12.906 --> 11:15.707
you belched
all through the whole game.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.877
Hey, that's how we applaud
on Melmac.

11:19.613 --> 11:20.945
Hey, good catch.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.947
[belching]

11:24.551 --> 11:26.451
Jake may have some problems

11:26.453 --> 11:29.454
but he's not going
to be sent to prison.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.890
Yeah?
Tell that to my cousin.

11:31.892 --> 11:34.059
Pretty boy Shumway.

11:34.061 --> 11:37.062
He grew up on the south
side of Melmac.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.164
The baddest part of the planet.

11:39.166 --> 11:41.366
If he didn't like your shoes..

11:41.368 --> 11:43.968
[imitates gunfire]

11:43.970 --> 11:45.270
Do you mean he'd shoot a person

11:45.272 --> 11:47.172
just because he didn't like
his shoes?

11:47.174 --> 11:49.307
No, he'd just point
at them and go..

11:49.309 --> 11:51.509
[imitates gunfire]

11:52.813 --> 11:54.412
Where's Lizard taking you?

11:54.414 --> 11:56.247
Out to a science fiction movie.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.149
Something about this guy
being shrunk

11:58.151 --> 12:00.618
and then injected
into someone else.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.520
Well, that's not
science fiction.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.522
A friend of mine did that once.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.124
He took a wrong turn

12:06.126 --> 12:09.227
and got stuck in the guy's nose.

12:09.229 --> 12:12.497
I'd rather get beat up
than be called a snitch.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.200
Yeah, that's the worst.

12:15.202 --> 12:18.670
On Melmac, some guy
called me a snitch

12:18.672 --> 12:23.174
just because I turned him in
to the secret police.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.909
What're you doing
in this barrel?

12:24.911 --> 12:30.048
Oh, there I was getting ready
to go up Widow-maker Falls.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.417
You went up a waterfall?

12:32.419 --> 12:37.722
Yeah, and the ride was so rough,
I almost threw down.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.357
[hiccups]

12:39.359 --> 12:41.926
- Oh, no!
- Well..

12:41.928 --> 12:44.896
[hiccups]
...yes.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.197
You're the first humans

12:46.199 --> 12:51.436
who've ever heard the dreaded
Melmackian hiccups.

12:51.438 --> 12:55.106
Uh, what is it that
makes them so dreaded

12:55.108 --> 12:58.543
besides that irritating
metallic echo?

12:58.545 --> 13:01.412
That irritating metallic echo

13:01.414 --> 13:03.414
gets louder and louder

13:03.416 --> 13:05.150
day by day

13:05.152 --> 13:07.652
week by week,
year by..

13:07.654 --> 13:08.787
[hiccups]

13:08.789 --> 13:09.888
...year.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.459
There are many things
in this universe

13:14.461 --> 13:17.495
you're not meant to understand.

13:17.497 --> 13:20.064
Now, that doesn't mean
they're not real.

13:20.066 --> 13:24.869
I'm real and whether
other people believe you or not

13:24.871 --> 13:27.238
you know I'm real.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.973
Thank you.

13:33.947 --> 13:36.381
Let me ask you something.

13:36.383 --> 13:39.551
Why are you wearing
all those utensils?

13:40.620 --> 13:42.420
Ah. Well, that's one
of the things

13:42.422 --> 13:44.522
you're not supposed
to understand.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.191
Uh, here's another one.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.726
You should set
a couple of pumpkin pies

13:48.728 --> 13:51.596
out on your back porch
once a week

13:51.598 --> 13:55.033
and never question
why they disappear.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.368
Uh, twice a week.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.539
So, what do you think?

14:01.541 --> 14:03.107
I think Johnny

14:03.109 --> 14:05.810
will never speak to me again.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.178
Hey, hey, relax.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.882
If Johnny's gonna be mad
at anybody, it'll be Fred.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.984
Booking all those
unprepared guests.

14:12.986 --> 14:16.654
Speaking of guests,
His Holiness John Paul is back.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.289
Great. Let's bring him out..

14:18.291 --> 14:20.491
[instrumental music]

14:23.396 --> 14:25.997
...just as soon
as I show these clips.

14:29.803 --> 14:31.536
Roll 'em!

14:31.538 --> 14:32.904
[choral music]

14:32.906 --> 14:34.906
[bell rings]

14:47.053 --> 14:50.088
I hear you're looking
for a few good monks.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.797
Oh, howdy, Raquel.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.799
[screaming]

15:08.141 --> 15:09.173
[screaming]

15:09.175 --> 15:10.909
[ALF screaming]

15:13.146 --> 15:15.146
[instrumental music on TV]

15:27.994 --> 15:29.627
Care for a cookie?

15:35.168 --> 15:37.869
Alright, after your nap.

15:40.006 --> 15:42.140
Oh, ALF. What are you doing?
We were just sitting..

15:42.142 --> 15:46.210
There'll be no talking
during tonight's performance.

15:46.212 --> 15:48.579
And now, our opening joke.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.415
Say hello, dummy.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.183
Hello, dummy.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.451
Aah! Aah!

15:53.453 --> 15:55.186
Oh, brother.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.220
Oh-oh!

15:56.222 --> 15:58.356
The crowd looks tough.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.158
So does the roast beef.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.160
[laughing]

16:08.568 --> 16:11.169
[screaming]

16:13.206 --> 16:14.639
ALF, are you alright?

16:14.641 --> 16:17.942
Oh, yeah.
Everything's fine.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.444
Why..

16:19.446 --> 16:21.546
Why do you
have those clothespins

16:21.548 --> 16:23.281
attached to your head?

16:23.283 --> 16:25.483
It's a form of acupressure.

16:25.485 --> 16:29.153
On Melmac, we use it
to relieve writer's block.

16:30.457 --> 16:31.956
Let's see.

16:31.958 --> 16:34.959
Which was the button
for a cheeseburger?

16:35.996 --> 16:37.161
Uh.

16:38.932 --> 16:40.231
[beeps]
Ah!

16:42.602 --> 16:45.003
Hey, you, come here.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.037
Yes?

16:46.039 --> 16:49.607
How did you get out
of your cage?

16:49.609 --> 16:51.476
I work here.

16:51.478 --> 16:52.777
Uh, look.

16:52.779 --> 16:53.845
I'll give you five bucks

16:53.847 --> 16:55.913
if you let me out of this cage.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.116
Ten if you clean it
while I'm out.

16:59.419 --> 17:02.320
Hey, you guys want
some beans?

17:02.322 --> 17:04.355
I do! I do!

17:04.357 --> 17:06.524
Ahh!
A loose kangaroo!

17:06.526 --> 17:08.159
[screaming]

17:08.161 --> 17:10.161
[whistle blows]

17:13.466 --> 17:14.499
Headache?

17:14.501 --> 17:16.634
You certainly are.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.302
Whoa, ho ho ho!

17:18.304 --> 17:20.738
The natives are restless!

17:22.876 --> 17:26.310
Hey, ladies and gentlemen,
it's Rich Little!

17:26.312 --> 17:27.545
Hi, Ed.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.614
What the heck
are you doing here?

17:29.616 --> 17:32.717
Well, I'm here to guest host
"The Tonight Show."

17:32.719 --> 17:35.186
What a coincidence. So am I.

17:35.188 --> 17:39.223
Not for long.
I just got a call from Johnny.

17:39.225 --> 17:43.761
Um, uh, what did my close,
personal friend Johnny say?

17:43.763 --> 17:46.197
He said, and I quote..

17:48.134 --> 17:51.135
[imitating Johnny Carson]
"Uh! Ha ha ha!

17:51.137 --> 17:56.307
Get over there and 86
that troublemaking buffoon."

17:57.343 --> 18:01.479
Yeah? Well, if Ed goes, I go.

18:01.481 --> 18:04.816
No, no, no, no.
He meant you, ALF.

18:04.818 --> 18:06.651
Listen, you've got a major

18:06.653 --> 18:08.553
religious leader backstage

18:08.555 --> 18:09.854
you've turned this whole thing

18:09.856 --> 18:11.856
into a commercial
for your show..

18:11.858 --> 18:13.091
Well, hey, you know

18:13.093 --> 18:15.226
if big John wants me
to step aside

18:15.228 --> 18:18.796
and let you show your clips,
so be it.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.365
I didn't bring any clips.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.633
In that case..

18:22.635 --> 18:25.369
Hey, Bobby,
roll my final clip.

18:25.371 --> 18:26.737
The one I like to call

18:26.739 --> 18:29.140
"ALF And Remembrance."

18:30.877 --> 18:32.910
Are you here
because of a painful secret

18:32.912 --> 18:35.713
from your past like I am?

18:35.715 --> 18:39.250
Or you are just one of those
guys who likes wearing a dress?

18:42.655 --> 18:45.223
Right.
We are a silent order.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.858
We don't speak.

18:46.860 --> 18:49.760
Ixnay on the<i> eaking-spay!</i>

18:51.631 --> 18:52.864
Got it.

18:58.204 --> 19:00.705
Hmm! Mnh! Mmm!

19:05.912 --> 19:07.278
Joke time, alright?

19:07.280 --> 19:09.447
This one will knock you
on your cassocks!

19:09.449 --> 19:13.551
What happened when the heater
went off in the convent?

19:13.553 --> 19:15.720
They had a bunch of blue nuns.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.822
Ha! Ha! Ha!

19:17.824 --> 19:21.058
Blue nuns. Get it? Ah!

19:25.198 --> 19:26.430
Tough room.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.435
I was gonna faint,
but I think I made my point.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.139
Too bad we didn't buy it.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.307
You didn't?

19:36.309 --> 19:38.309
[gasps]

19:39.812 --> 19:43.648
ALF, you fainted on a snail.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.683
Whoa. Whoa.

19:48.454 --> 19:49.820
Now, the trick here

19:49.822 --> 19:52.957
is to concentrate
all your energy

19:52.959 --> 19:57.562
and let it explode in a blinding
flash of destruction.

19:57.564 --> 19:58.796
Watch.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.300
Hyah!

20:03.303 --> 20:05.002
Alright!

20:05.004 --> 20:07.405
Well, that never
worked before.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.606
Do it again.

20:08.608 --> 20:09.840
Okay.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.244
Hyah!

20:14.681 --> 20:16.948
I guess there's only pain

20:16.950 --> 20:19.717
when you don't break the board.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.253
Unbelievable pain.

20:24.524 --> 20:25.556
Let me tuck you in.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.091
Okay.

20:27.093 --> 20:28.526
There you go.

20:28.528 --> 20:29.994
Thanks, ALF.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.696
You're a good friend.

20:31.698 --> 20:34.999
Hey, anything for my Willie.

20:35.001 --> 20:38.102
You want me to press my lips
up against your forehead?

20:38.104 --> 20:40.104
[screams]

20:43.409 --> 20:46.043
Well..

20:46.045 --> 20:47.845
That piece doesn't fit there.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.046
Yes, it does.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.684
Voila!

20:53.686 --> 20:57.021
Excuse me, Kate,
I'm off to South Dakota.

20:57.023 --> 21:00.491
I've got a rendezvous
with history.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.493
[instrumental music]

21:08.268 --> 21:10.968
ALF, why don't you try
holding your breath again?

21:10.970 --> 21:13.237
That should work.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.639
Okay.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.841
[inhales deeply]

21:24.317 --> 21:26.884
[gasping]

21:26.886 --> 21:29.086
[hiccups]

21:31.190 --> 21:32.290
Body block!

21:35.762 --> 21:37.361
Ha! Ha!

21:37.363 --> 21:40.765
We'll be right back
after this commercial.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.000
I hope it's a promo
for my show.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.539
[instrumental music]

21:52.211 --> 21:54.011
Well, let's put it to a vote.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.113
Was this the best
"Tonight Show" ever?

21:56.115 --> 21:59.183
[audience applauds]

21:59.185 --> 22:00.017
I abstain.

22:00.019 --> 22:02.753
And I demand a recount.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.955
And I'd like
to thank my guests

22:04.957 --> 22:06.724
Dr. Joyce Brothers.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.893
Joan Embery of the San Diego Zoo

22:08.895 --> 22:11.162
and His Holiness Pope..

22:11.164 --> 22:13.631
Oh, oh, ooh, I never
brought out the Pope!

22:13.633 --> 22:15.700
You've got 30 seconds.

22:15.702 --> 22:18.369
Ladies and gentlemen,
His Holiness Pope John Paul II.

22:18.371 --> 22:20.371
[instrumental music]

22:31.050 --> 22:31.882
Hey.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.617
I'd like to thank my guests

22:33.619 --> 22:35.086
Joyce, Joan

22:35.088 --> 22:36.987
and, of course, Pope.

22:36.989 --> 22:40.391
Uh, Johnny, sorry about your cup
and your dressing room

22:40.393 --> 22:43.027
uh, and the limo.
Uh. Did I say limo?

22:43.029 --> 22:45.830
Ha! That wasn't me,
just the first two.

22:45.832 --> 22:48.432
Goodnight, everybody!

22:48.434 --> 22:50.601
How'd he get those whites
so white?

22:50.603 --> 22:52.603
[theme music]

23:21.734 --> 23:23.934
[music continues]
