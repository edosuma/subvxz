when she's already serving

Look, if we are gonna be hanging
around a hospital all day

06:52.107 --> 06:54.718

might as well do it in style.

06:54.762 --> 06:57.852
Okay, my girl Lisa got us
this private room.

06:57.895 --> 07:00.376

this morning,

to finish up.

07:23.573 --> 07:24.966
I get that.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.881

07:26.924 --> 07:29.361
No, you just don't like hospitals.

07:29.405 --> 07:31.189

07:34.584 --> 07:36.499
- Mm, I'm not avoiding.
- Mm.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.196
I'm just healthy.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.372

Seeing the way you're
looking at me right now,

07:42.244 --> 07:44.725

from answering that one.

My daughter Piper is

07:54.735 --> 07:56.563
- Dad.
- What?

07:56.606 --> 07:58.913
We thought this day
would never come, right?

07:58.956 --> 08:00.523
Well, I'd say congratulations,
but that seems like

08:00.567 --> 08:02.003
too small a sentiment.

08:02.046 --> 08:03.526
How about "Thank God"?

08:03.570 --> 08:04.788

08:18.672 --> 08:20.325

08:23.633 --> 08:26.462
No, I'm transplanting
her heart this afternoon.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.159
I have a few questions
for you.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.988
Was Riley conscious when
you arrived at the scene?

08:31.032 --> 08:32.947
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
she was talking

08:32.990 --> 08:34.557
right up until
the moment she passed.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.385
Was she making sense?

08:36.428 --> 08:38.126
Well, she was in shock.

08:38.169 --> 08:42.043
Had no idea how serious
the accident was, but yeah.

08:42.086 --> 08:44.654
She was worried her husband
would be mad about the car.

08:44.698 --> 08:46.134
Hmm.

08:46.177 --> 08:47.744
Do you have any reason
to suspect that

08:47.788 --> 08:50.181
she was under the influence
of alcohol or drugs?

08:50.225 --> 08:51.182
No.

08:51.226 --> 08:53.228
Okay. Good.

08:53.271 --> 08:55.273
- Good luck today.
- Thanks, Officer.

08:55.317 --> 08:57.275
Excuse me.
I have to go meet my patient.

08:57.319 --> 08:58.494
Of course.

08:59.277 --> 09:00.931
Tim: Hey.

09:00.975 --> 09:02.803
Heard your fatal this morning
was a rough one.

09:02.846 --> 09:04.631
Yeah.

09:04.674 --> 09:07.503
Well, that girl is getting
a new heart because of it,

09:07.547 --> 09:11.202
so hold on to that
silver lining if you can.

09:11.246 --> 09:13.161
Her dad said they'd almost
given up hope

09:13.204 --> 09:14.728
that they'd ever
find a match.

09:14.771 --> 09:17.339
Guess she has
a rare blood type.

09:17.382 --> 09:19.950
As a parent,
there is nothing scarier

09:19.994 --> 09:22.257
than being unable
to help your child.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.607
Well, today is
their lucky day.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.659
Um, I'm gonna
hit the restroom.

09:32.702 --> 09:33.834
Do you want me
to come with you?

09:33.877 --> 09:35.400
I think I can handle it.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.185
Will you let them know
that I'm here?

09:37.228 --> 09:38.839
Sure.
Okay.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.773
Rock, Paper, Scissors?

09:59.816 --> 10:01.905
You should
definitely go first.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.385

fold under pressure.

10:07.432 --> 10:09.565

10:09.609 --> 10:12.916

10:12.960 --> 10:14.657

10:14.701 --> 10:17.225

to somebody about that.

10:26.321 --> 10:27.278

- Yeah. You -- You, too.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.547
Oh. Hey.

10:35.591 --> 10:37.201
Hi.
Hey.

10:37.245 --> 10:38.681
Um, d-do you know
where Sarah is?

10:38.725 --> 10:40.422
I-I'm here
for trial prep.

10:40.465 --> 10:41.815
I know.
She's out sick.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.251
Oh.

10:43.294 --> 10:45.427
They asked me to step in,
but that seems awkward,

10:45.470 --> 10:47.037
given our relationship.

10:47.081 --> 10:48.430
I say we reschedule.

10:48.473 --> 10:51.868
No.
Um...we're professionals.

10:51.912 --> 10:54.044
We're just discussing
the details of the case.

10:54.088 --> 10:55.350
It'll -- It'll be fine.

10:55.393 --> 10:57.700
Okay.
Um, let's get to it.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.180
Mm.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.139
Okay, sorry to
keep you waiting.

11:02.183 --> 11:03.532
It's been
a crazy morning.

11:03.575 --> 11:05.839
Test results are in, and

11:05.882 --> 11:07.884
I'm so sorry to have to
tell you this,

11:07.928 --> 11:10.147
but it looks like you
have prostate cancer.

11:10.191 --> 11:12.628
Oh.
You're not Mr. Johnson.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.891
Oh, no, no.
I am not.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.414
Is this Room 516 East?

11:16.458 --> 11:17.764
- It is.
- Mm-hmm.

11:17.807 --> 11:19.679
I'm so sorry.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.855
It looks like there's something
amiss with our system.

11:21.898 --> 11:24.379
Well, better the system
than my prostate.

11:24.422 --> 11:26.729
We have a psychologist
on standby

11:26.773 --> 11:28.122
if you need to
talk to someone.

11:28.165 --> 11:30.559
This qualifies as Critical
Incident Stress Debriefing,

11:30.602 --> 11:32.648
so there's
no charge to you.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.736
I think
I'll be alright.

11:38.262 --> 11:40.525
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.397
Our system is showing that
we have patients coding

11:42.440 --> 11:44.225
in every room on this floor.

11:44.268 --> 11:46.009
Gotta be a glitch, right?
A short?

11:46.053 --> 11:48.795
No, it's not a glitch
or a short.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.971
- How do you know?
- Because it's me.

11:51.014 --> 11:54.714
I've taken over
the entire network.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.106
And the backup servers.

11:56.150 --> 11:57.717
I have total control
of this hospital.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.109
And what is it
you want?

12:01.677 --> 12:03.331
Riley Templeton's heart.

12:03.374 --> 12:05.376
And if my wife
doesn't get the heart,

12:05.420 --> 12:08.510
I'm gonna start shutting down
every system in this hospital,

12:08.553 --> 12:09.946
and people start dying.

12:16.431 --> 12:18.346
- Nolan: Here she is.
- Where's the guy?

12:18.389 --> 12:20.000
Jonah Russell is cuffed
and in a conference room.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.784
An officer's watching him.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.525
His wife, Meredith, is in
a patient room being examined.

12:23.568 --> 12:25.135
She's in
pretty bad shape.

12:25.179 --> 12:27.790
This is Linda Brooks.
She runs the hospital.

12:27.834 --> 12:30.097
Detective Lopez. I'll be
spearheading the investigation.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.751
Can you give me
a status report?

12:31.794 --> 12:33.622
We got the alarms
turned off manually,

12:33.665 --> 12:35.842
and we're canceling all
non-essential procedures,

12:35.885 --> 12:38.540
but a full-scale evacuation
would be a massive undertaking.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.237
And we have critical-care
patients

12:40.281 --> 12:41.717
who won't survive
being moved.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.719
Evacuation's
the last resort.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.069
I have our Cyber Crimes Unit
working with your IT head,

12:46.113 --> 12:47.810
so hopefully, they can find
a way to force the guy out

12:47.854 --> 12:49.507
before
anything else happens.

12:49.551 --> 12:51.771
While we're waiting on that,
take a run at the husband.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.424
See what kind of guy
we're dealing with.

12:53.468 --> 12:54.730
Talk to the wife.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.210
Use that Midwestern charm
to convince her

12:56.253 --> 12:58.429
to stop her husband from
continuing this insanity.

12:58.473 --> 13:00.518
I'm not actually from
the Midwest, but I'll...

13:05.785 --> 13:08.135
When will they
bring my husband in?

13:08.178 --> 13:09.614
They won't.

13:09.658 --> 13:12.704
He's being questioned pending
arrest, like you are now.

13:12.748 --> 13:15.838
I didn't know Jonah's plan.
I swear.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.927
This morning, he just told me
to get in the car,

13:17.971 --> 13:19.624
said we were going in
for a checkup.

13:21.365 --> 13:24.586
I'm sorry.
For all this mess.

13:24.629 --> 13:28.198
Well, that helps.
A little.

13:28.242 --> 13:31.071
But you're gonna have to do a
lot more than say you're sorry.

13:31.114 --> 13:34.422
You need to convince
your husband to stop this.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.293
Now.

13:36.337 --> 13:38.513
There's 800 patients
in this hospital.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.123
Dozens of them
in critical care.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.996
Every moment that their
treatment is compromised,

13:43.039 --> 13:44.562
any one of them
could die.

13:44.606 --> 13:48.175
He's only doing this
because he loves me.

13:48.218 --> 13:51.961
I have a rare blood type
and I've had cancer.

13:52.005 --> 13:54.834
That's why I'm so low
on the list.

13:54.877 --> 13:58.663
Without a new heart,
I only have a few weeks left.

13:58.707 --> 14:01.579
I-I understand.

14:01.623 --> 14:04.321
I do.

14:04.365 --> 14:09.065
But what your husband is doing
is going to hurt people.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.850
Is your life worth more
than theirs?

14:10.893 --> 14:13.809
No.
No, of course not.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.768
Then you need to
tell Jonah to stop.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.382
I don't want to die.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.473
I'm sorry.

14:25.516 --> 14:26.866
Meredith --

14:26.909 --> 14:29.129
I need to rest.

14:29.172 --> 14:30.870
Jonah: Are you prepping
my wife for surgery?

14:30.913 --> 14:32.741
No, and they're
not going to.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.786
You need to
end this now.

14:34.830 --> 14:37.702
As soon as my wife gets
her heart, it all stops.

14:37.746 --> 14:40.662
But if anything happens to her
because you're wasting my time

14:40.705 --> 14:42.185
trying to talk me out of this,
then I'm --

14:42.229 --> 14:43.621
I'm gonna fry
the whole system.

14:43.665 --> 14:45.145
I'm -- I'm gonna kill
this hospital.

14:45.188 --> 14:47.669
Let's dial back
the threats, okay?

14:47.712 --> 14:50.063
So far, all you've really done
is hack the hospital's network

14:50.106 --> 14:52.282
and disrupt
one alarm system.

14:52.326 --> 14:55.242
Now, you cooperate now, charges
against you won't be so bad.

14:55.285 --> 14:59.246
Do you really think that I care
about what happens to me?

14:59.289 --> 15:01.944
Look, my wife has been
my whole life for 30 years,

15:01.988 --> 15:03.859
and for the last two,
I've watched her

15:03.903 --> 15:06.818
get sicker and sicker because
she needs a new heart,

15:06.862 --> 15:10.822
and I-I couldn't
help her.

15:10.866 --> 15:12.128
But now I can.

15:12.172 --> 15:13.738
What time is it?
Why?

15:13.782 --> 15:15.523
Because I need to enter the
abort code into the tablet

15:15.566 --> 15:18.700
by 10:45, otherwise phase two
of the attack begins,

15:18.743 --> 15:21.746
and then people really will,
uh, start to get hurt.

15:21.790 --> 15:23.661
That's in 20 seconds.
What's gonna happen?

15:25.489 --> 15:26.882
You'll see.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.456
What the...

15:35.499 --> 15:37.240
What's going on?

15:41.418 --> 15:42.637
What's happening?

15:42.680 --> 15:43.725
Our computers
just locked.

15:43.768 --> 15:45.248
We don't have access
to anything --

15:45.292 --> 15:48.164
patient histories, medication
schedules, doctors' orders.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.123
It's all gone.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.733
Got anything?

15:53.474 --> 15:55.780
Excuse me.
Are you the officer in charge?

15:55.824 --> 15:57.739
I'm Detective Lopez.
How can I help you?

15:57.782 --> 16:00.437
Well, I'm hearing some rumors
that some crazy guy

16:00.481 --> 16:01.961
is trying to
take the heart

16:02.004 --> 16:03.745
that's supposed to go
to my daughter.

16:03.788 --> 16:06.400
I'm sorry to say
you heard right.

16:06.443 --> 16:07.749
You must be Piper.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.577
Yes. Um...

16:09.620 --> 16:12.319
Please, no one will tell us
what's going on.

16:12.362 --> 16:14.625
My daughter has been through
so much already.

16:14.669 --> 16:16.018
We really
deserve some answers.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.760
I'll tell you
what I can say.

16:18.803 --> 16:22.416
A man has hacked into the
hospital computer network,

16:22.459 --> 16:25.767
hoping to force the hospital to
give his wife the donor heart.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.116
You can't let them.

16:27.160 --> 16:28.596
It's not up to me.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.467
It's not up to
the hospital, either.

16:30.511 --> 16:32.382
I'm next on the list.

16:32.426 --> 16:34.906
By law, the hospital has to
give the heart to me.

16:34.950 --> 16:35.907
Do you have a lawyer?

16:35.951 --> 16:37.605
We don't have
money for that.

16:37.648 --> 16:39.781
We spent all our savings
on her care.

16:39.824 --> 16:41.652
I'm not allowed to
make a referral,

16:41.696 --> 16:44.307
but I happen to know
Mr. Evers

16:44.351 --> 16:47.006
has an annoying habit
of working for free.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.095
Did you ever hear Caleb talking
to Rosalind on the phone?

16:49.138 --> 16:51.749
Mm, no.

16:51.793 --> 16:54.404
Did he talk about her
as if they were communicating?

16:54.448 --> 16:57.190
No.

16:57.233 --> 17:00.758
So how can you be sure
he was working with her?

17:02.151 --> 17:04.545
Becau-- Because she
told me herself

17:04.588 --> 17:06.329
when I visited her
in prison.

17:06.373 --> 17:08.462
She repeated the song
I sang in the barrel.

17:08.505 --> 17:09.854
How -- How would
she know that

17:09.898 --> 17:13.075
if her and Caleb
weren't in communication?

17:13.119 --> 17:15.425
You know
I'm only asking you because...

17:19.212 --> 17:21.953
Lucy.
I just want you to be ready.

17:21.997 --> 17:24.826
I'm familiar with
the concept of trial prep.

17:24.869 --> 17:27.655
I know.

17:27.698 --> 17:31.093
Uh, how about
we take a break?

17:31.137 --> 17:32.181
Yeah.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.403
I could
use some coffee.

17:36.446 --> 17:38.883
Well, you're in luck.

17:38.927 --> 17:40.320
We just got
a new coffee maker.

17:40.363 --> 17:41.495
The old one
took a bullet.

17:41.538 --> 17:43.062
New, huh?

17:43.105 --> 17:45.107
That's pretty fancy
for government work.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.935
Well, new for us.

17:46.978 --> 17:49.198
I'm pretty sure it was born
before we were.

17:49.242 --> 17:51.200
Come on.

17:56.684 --> 17:59.295
Is this food for anybody,
or do you have to work here?

17:59.339 --> 18:02.690
Oh, it's employees only,
but I won't tell.

18:02.733 --> 18:05.127
What do you want?
Whatcha got?

18:05.171 --> 18:07.173
Well, if you
love preservatives,

18:07.216 --> 18:08.522
you've come to
the right place.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.132
Super bad for your health, though,

18:10.176 --> 18:12.874
and the packaging is
terrible for the planet.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.136
Farming's no better.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.572
If you wanna
get real about it,

18:15.616 --> 18:17.096
you're trading packaging
for fertilizer.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.272
Oh, yeah. And meat's just
antibiotics and methane, so...

18:21.012 --> 18:23.624
So, basically, we have to learn
how to live on air.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.843
Ooh,
can I have one?

18:25.887 --> 18:27.410
Sure.

18:27.454 --> 18:29.064
I wondered where you went.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.197
Chris: Two watery coffees,
coming up.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.328
How's it going?

18:32.372 --> 18:34.069
Uh, great.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.245
This is Austin.
He's saving the planet.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.813
Oh. Good to know
someone's doing it.

18:38.856 --> 18:41.816
Um, you can go.
I-I'm fine here.

18:41.859 --> 18:43.165
I don't know.

18:43.209 --> 18:44.993
I'm finding this all
so fascinating.

18:45.036 --> 18:47.996
You know, justice
and laws and stuff.

18:48.039 --> 18:51.739
Uh-huh. And what exactly
is so interesting?

18:53.175 --> 18:54.742
Chris:
♪ ...you'll miss me

18:54.785 --> 18:58.006
♪ While I'm alone
and blue as can be ♪

18:58.049 --> 18:59.399
You okay?

18:59.442 --> 19:01.444
♪ Dream a little dream...

19:01.488 --> 19:04.143
Lucy: ♪ ...of me

19:04.186 --> 19:06.406
I'm so sorry.

19:06.449 --> 19:08.843
It was in my head.
I wasn't thinking.

19:08.886 --> 19:12.151
I-It was thoughtless and stupid,
and I'm sorry.

19:12.194 --> 19:16.720
The song was stuck
in your head because you've...

19:16.764 --> 19:18.679
because you've
seen the video.

19:18.722 --> 19:21.638
Well, yeah.
It's evidence.

19:21.682 --> 19:23.205
Right, right.
No, of course you did.

19:23.249 --> 19:27.209
You're in the D.A.'s office,
and it's evidence,

19:27.253 --> 19:30.473
so...you've...

19:30.517 --> 19:31.996
Lucy, I should have
told you I'd seen it.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.259
I'm sorry.

19:33.302 --> 19:35.609
No, you said
that part already. Um...

19:35.652 --> 19:37.828
I just --
I just need a minute.

19:37.872 --> 19:38.568
Lucy, p--

19:38.612 --> 19:40.701
Please, can you...

19:40.744 --> 19:42.746
Yeah.

19:50.145 --> 19:52.321
Knock, knock.
I have a favor to ask.

19:52.365 --> 19:54.671
Our hospital
social worker's tied up.

19:54.715 --> 19:58.284
Would you mind
keeping an eye on Rory here?

19:58.327 --> 20:00.024
He took a fall
on a field trip.

20:00.068 --> 20:01.939
He seems okay now,
but the E.R. lost power

20:01.983 --> 20:03.593
before
he could be examined.

20:03.637 --> 20:04.855
We're trying to get
in touch with his parents.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.248
Of course.
Bring him in.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.467
Thanks.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.338
Hop on up into bed.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.907
Good.

20:12.950 --> 20:14.474
Okay.

20:14.517 --> 20:16.476
A doctor will be by
to check on him soon.

20:16.519 --> 20:19.130
Hi, Rory.
I'm Nyla Harper.

20:19.174 --> 20:21.698
This is, um...

20:21.742 --> 20:25.224
Hmm. Well, so much
for a private room.
Mm-hmm.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.400
Sorry, sir.
Right now, we're nowhere.

20:27.443 --> 20:28.705
Jonah's refusing
to back down.

20:28.749 --> 20:30.054
What about the wife?

20:30.098 --> 20:31.404
She knows what
he's doing is wrong,

20:31.447 --> 20:32.666
but is too scared
of dying to stop it.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.320
Any luck with
the Cyber guys?

20:34.363 --> 20:36.496
No, but they've
confirmed that Jonah

20:36.539 --> 20:38.106
has got a stranglehold on
the hospital's network.

20:38.149 --> 20:40.064
Did FEMA get there? <i>Just landed.</i>

20:40.108 --> 20:41.675
They're talking about
setting up a field hospital

20:41.718 --> 20:42.850
in the parking lot.

20:42.893 --> 20:44.721
Best case --
that takes 24 hours.

20:44.765 --> 20:46.201
We don't have
that kind of time.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.421
Any intel on Jonah
that might help us?

20:48.464 --> 20:50.901
<i>No criminal history.</i> <i>
Master's degree from Cal Poly.</i>

20:50.945 --> 20:53.469
Ran an IT department
for a credit union

20:53.513 --> 20:56.429
until his wife's illness
required full-time care.

20:56.472 --> 20:58.474
What about family?
Anything I can use for leverage?

20:58.518 --> 21:00.215
Anything he cares about
as much as her?

21:00.259 --> 21:02.652
No parents,
no siblings, no kids.

21:02.696 --> 21:05.307
Coworkers describe him
as a loner.

21:05.351 --> 21:09.311
His only police contact
was a 5150 hold in '09

21:09.355 --> 21:11.531
after she threatened
to leave.

21:11.574 --> 21:13.228
She's his whole world.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.752
Great. We should all be so lucky
to have such devotion.

21:15.796 --> 21:18.364
I got a meeting.

21:18.407 --> 21:20.279
Are you still able
to treat patients?

21:20.322 --> 21:21.845
Well, we're using
paper charts for now,

21:21.889 --> 21:24.021
but almost everything
is hooked up to the network --

21:24.065 --> 21:27.155
records, pharmacy,
even surgical equipment.

21:27.198 --> 21:28.896
How long before you
have to make a choice?

21:28.939 --> 21:31.333
A human heart is only viable
for four to six hours

21:31.377 --> 21:33.466
once it's been removed
from a donor's body.

21:33.509 --> 21:35.903
I've already lost
two of those hours.

21:35.946 --> 21:37.687
So, I'm going to get prepped
for surgery,

21:37.731 --> 21:41.343
because I am putting that heart
in someone in an hour.

21:41.387 --> 21:44.259
It's up to you to decide
who my patient will be.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.957
W-- It has to be Piper,
right?

21:47.001 --> 21:49.351
I mean, you can't just decide
who gets an organ.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.832
Excuse me.
I'm Wesley Evers.

21:51.875 --> 21:53.355
I'm representing Graham Scott
and his daughter, Piper.

21:53.399 --> 21:54.791
I need to
speak with you.

21:54.835 --> 21:56.358
Uh, Mr. Evers,
now is not a good time.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.360
Now is the only time.

21:58.404 --> 22:02.233
If your hospital decides to give
in to this terrorist's demands,

22:02.277 --> 22:04.235
to take away the heart that
has been promised to Miss Scott,

22:04.279 --> 22:05.846
that is tantamount to
organ brokering.

22:05.889 --> 22:07.891
If you continue
down this path,

22:07.935 --> 22:09.458
I will file a report
with the medical board,

22:09.502 --> 22:11.373
- and you will be st--
- Mr. Evers, let me assure you,

22:11.417 --> 22:14.333
I have no intention of giving in
to Mr. Russell's demands.

22:17.597 --> 22:18.989
Can I get that
in writing?

22:19.033 --> 22:20.469
Nurse Lisa:
Everything's down.

22:20.513 --> 22:22.471
Vents, cardiac monitors,
medicine drips.

22:22.515 --> 22:23.646
Isn't there
a backup generator?

22:23.690 --> 22:25.082
Yeah, but it
isn't coming on.

22:34.570 --> 22:37.268
Help!

22:37.312 --> 22:40.054
I need some help
in here!

22:40.097 --> 22:42.056
Someone! Help!

22:46.103 --> 22:48.149
I need oxygen.
15 liters.

23:02.642 --> 23:03.773
He's gone.

23:08.343 --> 23:11.085
Meredith Russell gets the heart.
We're prepping the O.R. now.

23:11.128 --> 23:12.826
- Absolutely not.
- We have no choice.

23:12.869 --> 23:14.480
Yes, you do.

23:14.523 --> 23:15.872
I have calls in to the OPTN
and the U.S. Health Department.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.352
You will not
act until --

23:17.396 --> 23:18.788
Look, do you think I feel
good about this?

23:18.832 --> 23:21.356
I don't.
Nobody does.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.879
But I'm not gonna have
any more patients die

23:22.923 --> 23:24.054
when I could have
done something about it.

23:24.098 --> 23:27.536
So tell your client
that I'm sorry.

23:31.540 --> 23:32.933
It's -- It's not right.

23:32.976 --> 23:34.325
No, it's not.

23:34.369 --> 23:35.936
I will sue them for a fortune,
and I'll win.

23:38.982 --> 23:41.507
Piper will
never live to see it.

23:45.249 --> 23:47.338
Linda: You win.

23:47.382 --> 23:48.992
They're prepping the O.R.
for Meredith's surgery now.

23:50.385 --> 23:52.256
Ah. Thank God.

23:52.300 --> 23:53.649
This isn't
a happy thing, Jonah.

23:53.693 --> 23:55.303
Someone died
because of you.

23:55.346 --> 23:57.392
That's the only reason
the hospital's giving in.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.872
Yeah, but if the hospital
had responded sooner,

23:58.915 --> 24:00.221
that person
would still be alive.

24:00.264 --> 24:02.528
And I've been very clear
about how this works.

24:02.571 --> 24:04.530
Lose the attitude.

24:04.573 --> 24:07.010
You got what you want.

24:07.054 --> 24:08.838
Turn the lights
back on.

24:13.756 --> 24:15.149
There.

24:15.192 --> 24:18.152
That should, uh, restore
the lights in, uh,

24:18.195 --> 24:20.546
both the intensive care
and O.R. suites, for now.

24:20.589 --> 24:22.330
The rest of the hospital
is still dark.

24:22.373 --> 24:24.158
But now, I-I need you
to take me to see my wife,

24:24.201 --> 24:26.203
'cause I gotta be there
for the operation,

24:26.247 --> 24:28.684
make sure that you're actually
gonna follow through with it.

24:32.383 --> 24:33.994
Well, I guess
we'll be there with you.

24:42.393 --> 24:43.917
Hey.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.267
Again,
I'm so, so sor--
Sorry.

24:46.310 --> 24:48.530
I know.

24:51.141 --> 24:54.971
I-I need you
to do something for me.

24:55.015 --> 24:56.625
Anything.

24:56.669 --> 24:58.671
I need to
see the video.

24:58.714 --> 25:00.324
- The barrel video?
- Yeah.

25:00.368 --> 25:02.065
You've seen it.

25:02.109 --> 25:04.198
Half the lawyers in this
building have seen it, and --

25:04.241 --> 25:06.417
and I haven't.

25:06.461 --> 25:10.160
Lucy, it's...

25:10.204 --> 25:12.206
it's incredibly
hard to watch.

25:12.249 --> 25:13.990
I need to see it.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.255
Okay.

25:31.878 --> 25:33.270
Should I stay, or...

25:33.314 --> 25:34.445
Mnh-mnh.

25:34.489 --> 25:38.275
No. Um...

25:38.319 --> 25:39.625
thank you.

of this seven-hour
surgery.

26:34.549 --> 26:37.160
You will not speak to
the surgery team, understood?

26:37.204 --> 26:38.858
You make one move during
any of those seven hours,

26:38.901 --> 26:40.294
we remove you
from the O.R.

26:40.337 --> 26:41.600
and take you straight in
for processing.

26:41.643 --> 26:43.514
Wh--
Of course.

26:43.558 --> 26:44.907
I mean, look, this --

26:44.951 --> 26:47.083
this surgery's gonna
save my wife's life.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.608
Why -- Why would I do
anything to disrupt it?

26:49.651 --> 26:52.741
You do realize you're putting
those doctors under duress.

26:52.785 --> 26:54.656
The both of you,

26:54.700 --> 26:56.919
you're essentially holding
this whole hospital hostage.

26:56.963 --> 26:58.051
Don't listen to that, sweetheart.

26:58.094 --> 26:59.574
H-How you doing, baby?

26:59.618 --> 27:00.531
Just nervous.

27:08.888 --> 27:11.064
Drop it! Stop!
Turn around!

27:12.718 --> 27:15.459
What were
you thinking?

27:15.503 --> 27:19.638
If she dies,
my daughter doesn't.

27:23.076 --> 27:26.732
Here.
You got what you wanted.

27:26.775 --> 27:29.125
Now bring the hospital
back online.

27:29.169 --> 27:31.475
No.
Why not?

27:31.519 --> 27:33.739
Well, 'cause that's
not how this works.

27:33.782 --> 27:35.479
H-Hey, hey,
watch that.

27:35.523 --> 27:38.134
<i>Mr. Russell, you have a lot of</i> <i>
power right now.</i>

27:38.178 --> 27:40.310
<i>Which is why, despite</i> <i>
my objections, you're here.</i>

27:40.354 --> 27:43.139
<i>But let me make one thing</i> <i>
perfectly clear.</i>

27:43.183 --> 27:45.098
<i>We have work to do.</i>

27:45.141 --> 27:47.666
<i>Your strong-arm tactics</i> <i>
are helping no one.</i>

27:53.497 --> 27:54.847
So, what's gonna happen
to that guy

27:54.890 --> 27:56.718
that tried to
attack Meredith?

27:56.762 --> 28:00.461
He'll be charged with assault,
probably go to prison,

28:00.504 --> 28:02.942
and his daughter will most
likely die while he's in there.

28:02.985 --> 28:04.552
Does that
make you happy?

28:04.595 --> 28:07.860
My wife is getting a second
chance that she really deserves.

28:07.903 --> 28:09.905
That's all I care about.

28:12.212 --> 28:15.084
He has not looked up from
that thing in an hour.

28:15.128 --> 28:17.130
Oh, come on.
He's just having some fun.

28:17.173 --> 28:19.088
I hope this is
not your attitude

28:19.132 --> 28:21.525
when it comes to
our child's screen time.

28:21.569 --> 28:23.353
What attitude?

28:23.397 --> 28:25.878
I'm just saying, there's nothing
with a little gaming.

28:25.921 --> 28:27.401
I like gaming.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.708
Yeah, you like
gaming a little too much.

28:31.361 --> 28:33.146
I don't feel good.

28:33.189 --> 28:34.800
What's wrong?

28:37.803 --> 28:39.761
My head hurts.

28:41.763 --> 28:43.983
Let me see.

28:44.026 --> 28:45.724
His pupils are
two different sizes.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.421
That is a sign
of a serious head injury.

28:47.464 --> 28:48.901
Can you go
get the doctor?

28:48.944 --> 28:51.425
Hey, Rory,
w-what happened?

28:51.468 --> 28:53.427
Did you hit your head?

28:53.470 --> 28:56.604
I think so.
I don't remember.

28:56.647 --> 28:59.520
Rory!
Are you okay?

28:59.563 --> 29:00.956
Oh, my baby.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.479
Hi, Mom. Hi.

29:02.523 --> 29:04.351
My head really hurts.

29:04.394 --> 29:05.787
Oh.
Come on.

29:05.831 --> 29:07.267
- Let's get you home.
- It's fine. Come on.

29:07.310 --> 29:08.964
Uh, actually, sorry.

29:09.008 --> 29:12.402
I-I know you don't know me, but
he has a serious head injury.

29:12.446 --> 29:13.795
That's okay.
Nothing an ice pack can't fix.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.057
Right, buddy?

29:15.101 --> 29:16.406
N-No, I don't --
I don't think --

29:16.450 --> 29:17.799
Hold on.
Let me take a look at him.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.979
Your son is showing signs
of a concussion.

29:24.023 --> 29:25.894
We're having some issues
with our equipment right now,

29:25.938 --> 29:27.591
but it's important
Rory stay

29:27.635 --> 29:29.463
until we can run some tests on
him, make sure his head's okay.

29:29.506 --> 29:30.594
No, we're
- taking him home.
- Come on, baby.

29:30.638 --> 29:32.509
- Sir, I really think --
- Rory is fine.

29:32.553 --> 29:33.989
Kids play.
These things happen.

29:34.033 --> 29:35.599
He just needs a little bit
of rest, is all.

29:35.643 --> 29:36.905
Sir, you don't understand.

29:36.949 --> 29:38.385
It's possible
there could be fluid

29:38.428 --> 29:39.821
putting pressure
on his brain.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.692
He could go to sleep
and never wake up.

29:41.736 --> 29:43.042
Thank you, but we don't
need the kind of help

29:43.085 --> 29:44.391
that you offer here.

29:44.434 --> 29:46.001
It's against
our beliefs.

29:46.045 --> 29:47.873
I-I'm sorry, beliefs?
D-Did you not hear him?

29:47.916 --> 29:49.483
H-He could
have a skull fracture.

29:49.526 --> 29:51.790
Okay, we believe that
the only care Rory needs

29:51.833 --> 29:53.269
is the healing power
of prayer.

29:53.313 --> 29:55.489
Listen, folks, maybe you should
just hear the doctor out.

29:55.532 --> 29:57.360
I'm sorry, but why are
you two butting in?

29:57.404 --> 29:58.840
You're not
his parents.

29:58.884 --> 30:00.363
Okay, you -- you have to
do something here.

30:00.407 --> 30:01.582
I can't.
I don't have the authority.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.671
But I do.

30:03.714 --> 30:06.587
I have probably cause
to take your son into
protective custody,

30:06.630 --> 30:09.982
according to Section 300 of the
Welfare and Institution Code.

30:10.025 --> 30:11.853
- Excuse me?
- That's not happening.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.724
Yeah, it is, and if you try
to interfere,

30:13.768 --> 30:16.902
I have the authority to put you
both under custody as well.

30:16.945 --> 30:18.904
We're gonna go
call our lawyer.

30:18.947 --> 30:21.515
We'll be right out in the hall,
okay, Rory?

30:23.125 --> 30:24.910
We'll be right back,
okay?

41:35.231 --> 41:37.190
Even if they did,
there's no jury in the world

41:37.233 --> 41:39.105
would convict him.

41:39.148 --> 41:40.454
What about Meredith?

41:40.498 --> 41:42.412
She is on her way
to hospice care.

41:42.456 --> 41:47.026
Sadly, she does
not have much time left.

41:47.069 --> 41:50.899
Well, I have heard on hard days,
the only prescription

41:50.943 --> 41:53.423
is a hot bath
and a cold glass of wine.

41:53.467 --> 41:54.903
Really?

41:54.947 --> 41:56.731
I've never been much of
a bath guy.

41:56.775 --> 41:58.428
Even if you
take it with me?

41:58.472 --> 42:01.562
Oh, that is an entirely
different kind of prescription.

42:01.606 --> 42:04.086
Mm.

42:04.130 --> 42:05.827
As soon as you
take a shower.

42:05.871 --> 42:09.265
I will have you know,
this smell was hard-earned

42:09.309 --> 42:13.052
by transporting 27 patients out
of and back into this hospital.

42:13.095 --> 42:16.011
Yeah, no, and I will be happy to
reward all that hard work

42:16.055 --> 42:17.578
with some quality
naked time,

42:17.622 --> 42:20.581
just as soon as you
scrub those pits.

42:20.625 --> 42:25.412
♪ Oooooh
