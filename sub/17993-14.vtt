00:02.535 --> 00:04.270
{\an8}If nobody speaks up, I will.

00:04.337 --> 00:05.872
{\an8}(Nina Parker)
Previously on "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood The Reunion."

00:05.939 --> 00:07.073
{\an8}Are you guys engaged?

00:07.140 --> 00:09.109
{\an8}Yes, we are.
We're engaged.

00:09.175 --> 00:12.278
{\an8}Well, then where do we stand?

00:09.175 --> 00:12.278
{\an7}Do you want me to say that
we're together? No, we're not.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.347
{\an7}I want you to kick this (bleep)
out, and I'm getting back
in the bed--

00:14.414 --> 00:16.683
{\an8}I never said that.

00:16.750 --> 00:17.851
{\an8}I just did the best
that I could.

00:17.917 --> 00:19.018
{\an8}There's no manual to this.

00:19.085 --> 00:20.253
{\an8}You know my sex was good.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.521
{\an8}I'm not speaking on that.

00:21.588 --> 00:23.156
{\an8}He know he was (bleep)
for that (bleep).

00:23.223 --> 00:25.458
{\an8}My mother doesn't even
talk to me.

00:25.525 --> 00:29.262
{\an8}These mother(bleep) want
to sit here and judge me?

00:29.329 --> 00:30.563
{\an8}Don't defend these hoes.

00:30.630 --> 00:31.965
{\an8}You don't even have
a roof over your head.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.000
{\an8}We're not gonna
condone (bleep).

00:34.067 --> 00:35.568
{\an8}What's that, Rich?

00:34.067 --> 00:35.568
{\an7}Okay?

00:35.635 --> 00:36.936
{\an8}Damn!

00:37.003 --> 00:39.506
{\an8}Please don't make excuses,
ever, about being a mother!

00:39.572 --> 00:41.408
{\an8}I don't want to hear
anything that she has to say.

00:41.474 --> 00:42.409
{\an8}Who you talking to?

00:42.475 --> 00:44.244
{\an8}(all shouting)

00:44.310 --> 00:46.479
{\an8}Bitch, you are not
my child's mother.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.881
{\an9}Hey, hey!

00:47.947 --> 00:49.482
{\an7}Bitch, don't let this dress
fool you, bitch!

00:49.549 --> 00:51.017
{\an8}(Nina)
Where did Princess come from?

00:51.084 --> 00:52.952
{\an8}(Bleep) her!

00:53.019 --> 00:54.187
{\an8}(Nina Parker)
And tonight, on part two of

00:54.254 --> 00:56.122
{\an8}"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood
The Reunion"...

00:56.189 --> 00:57.657
{\an8}Whose ass did you beat, bitch?

00:57.724 --> 00:59.659
{\an8}'Cause you--

01:00.860 --> 01:03.363
{\an8}Hazel tried to shame me
for being gay.

01:03.430 --> 01:04.397
{\an8}(Hazel-E)
Eat that, bitch.

01:04.464 --> 01:05.999
{\an8}Bitch, you a (bleep) side ho.

01:06.065 --> 01:08.301
{\an8}I will (bleep) you up!
Try it!

01:08.368 --> 01:09.469
{\an8}What happened to you, honey?

01:09.536 --> 01:11.504
{\an8}You're on this stage
because of me.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.174
{\an7}At the end of the day, it's
about the mother(bleep) money.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.443
{\an9}(Bleep).

01:16.509 --> 01:18.878
{\an9}(sobbing)

01:24.150 --> 01:26.186
{\an4}(Moniece)
Why are you talking to me?
Why are you talking to me?

01:26.252 --> 01:27.620
{\an5}(Brandi) Because I'm a mother!

01:26.252 --> 01:27.620
Who you talking to?

01:27.687 --> 01:29.289
But you're not my son's mother!

01:29.355 --> 01:30.423
(all shouting)

01:30.490 --> 01:32.058
I will (bleep) you up!

01:32.125 --> 01:34.060
(all shouting)

01:35.728 --> 01:38.264
Hey! Hey, hey!

01:38.331 --> 01:39.399
(Bleep), bitch!

01:39.466 --> 01:40.967
Don't let this dress
fool you, bitch.

01:41.034 --> 01:42.702
{\an1}Sit down, 'cause nobody's
gonna get to you through me

01:42.769 --> 01:43.837
and I'm not gonna let--

01:43.903 --> 01:45.171
(Rich)
Hey, yo, Mo.

01:45.238 --> 01:48.508
{\an1}Do not act like a punk
no more on this (bleep) stage.

01:48.575 --> 01:51.177
You in New York.

01:51.244 --> 01:52.946
{\an1}Neither one of those
(bleep) nut jobs

01:53.012 --> 01:54.280
are the mother of my child.

01:54.347 --> 01:55.348
Let her have her thing.

01:55.415 --> 01:57.217
{\an1}(Moniece)
I have had enough!

01:57.283 --> 01:59.552
{\an1}Stupid-ass,
bum-ass bitches like her!

01:59.619 --> 02:00.587
(Bleep) her!

02:00.653 --> 02:02.121
(audience gasps)

02:02.188 --> 02:04.390
No, no, no!
No, no, no!

02:04.457 --> 02:05.458
{\an1}Bitch!

02:05.525 --> 02:07.026
{\an1}Say it to my mother(bleep)
face, ho!

02:07.093 --> 02:08.728
{\an3}Bitch!

02:08.794 --> 02:09.929
(Bleep) you, bitch!

02:09.996 --> 02:11.598
Move your mother--

02:11.664 --> 02:14.634
{\an1}You (bleep)
wicked-ass witch!

02:14.701 --> 02:16.769
{\an1}Marla, check your daughter,
'cause she won't--

02:16.836 --> 02:18.705
{\an1}Straight up,
I'm a grown woman.

02:18.771 --> 02:20.740
Just relax, just relax,
just relax.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.446
No!

02:26.513 --> 02:30.717
(Marla)
No, no! No, no, no, no!

02:30.783 --> 02:32.519
{\an1}Where did Princess
come from?

02:32.585 --> 02:33.520
{\an5}(Marla)
Because I'm letting you know,
I got it.

02:36.055 --> 02:38.658
{\an5}(Nina)
All right, things
are getting very heated.

02:38.725 --> 02:40.693
(all shouting)

02:40.760 --> 02:41.961
(Bleep) you, bitch!

02:42.028 --> 02:42.962
Try me, bitch!

02:43.029 --> 02:45.265
You a bitch!

02:45.331 --> 02:47.033
I'll (bleep) you up, ho!

02:49.869 --> 02:52.438
{\an8}I'm literally losing--

02:52.505 --> 02:55.575
{\an8}I'm losing my mind.

02:55.642 --> 02:59.379
I can't deal
with this anymore.

02:59.445 --> 03:00.780
{\an1}Stop it.

03:00.847 --> 03:05.184
I can't deal with this
kind of (bleep) anymore.

03:05.251 --> 03:06.486
{\an3}(sobbing)

03:06.553 --> 03:08.421
Nobody was there
for me, nobody.

03:08.488 --> 03:10.189
(Nia)
Moniece.

03:10.256 --> 03:13.560
I don't want to see anybody,
I don't want to see anybody.

03:13.626 --> 03:15.595
I don't want to see anybody!

03:17.096 --> 03:19.165
You all right?

03:19.232 --> 03:20.700
I'm just so
(bleep) mad.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.101
Why?
Why you mad for?

03:22.168 --> 03:23.136
{\an3}Stop it.

03:23.202 --> 03:24.804
Tell her to shut
the (bleep) up.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.139
You don't (bleep)
know my struggle.

03:26.205 --> 03:27.373
{\an1}You don't know
what the (bleep) I been--

03:27.440 --> 03:30.543
"I'm a mom every day!
I'm a mom every day!"

03:30.610 --> 03:32.178
Bitch, you're a (bleep).

03:32.245 --> 03:34.314
{\an1}Why do you keep letting
that (bleep) make you mad?

03:34.380 --> 03:36.983
{\an1}'Cause she don't know you
from a (bleep) can of paint!

03:37.050 --> 03:40.286
{\an1}Stop being angered
by that (bleep), Mo!

03:40.353 --> 03:42.322
That mother(bleep) don't know
you, don't know what you do,

03:42.388 --> 03:45.725
{\an4}don't know when you and Kam
go to the mother(bleep)
Chuck E. Cheese

03:45.792 --> 03:46.893
and do what y'all do.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.428
Don't know when
he at your house.

03:48.494 --> 03:52.031
She owes America an apology,
'cause she angry at herself.

03:52.098 --> 03:53.333
You not angry at me,

03:53.399 --> 03:55.034
but you not gonna
punk me on camera.

03:55.101 --> 03:56.569
I don't care
about the camera.

03:56.636 --> 03:59.706
She's a (bleep) weak little
girl, she needs to grow up.

03:59.772 --> 04:02.508
Stop giving away your power!

04:02.575 --> 04:04.043
Now she,
in her mind,

04:04.110 --> 04:07.480
{\an1}she somewhere in the dressing
room acting like she good.

04:07.547 --> 04:09.849
Mission accomplished.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.484
You the one up here mad.

04:11.551 --> 04:14.087
Right?
Right or wrong?

04:14.153 --> 04:15.121
{\an1}Right.

04:15.188 --> 04:16.456
{\an3}Stop it.

04:16.522 --> 04:18.391
That (bleep) is so
bull(bleep) and frivolous.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.726
{\an5}We got way
bigger fish to fry.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.726
{\an1}Right.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.195
{\an1}Stop crying.
Give me a kiss.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.764
I love you.

04:24.831 --> 04:28.101
{\an1}Knock it off,
you hear?

04:28.167 --> 04:29.736
{\an5}(Nina)
All right,
after taking a minute,

04:29.802 --> 04:32.538
we're gonna jump right back in
to where we left off.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.707
{\an8}Okay, so I need to know,

04:34.774 --> 04:36.442
{\an8}you guys,
everything got really crazy.

04:36.509 --> 04:38.578
What happened?

04:38.645 --> 04:39.846
Does anybody want to--

04:39.912 --> 04:42.081
{\an8}Moniece, can you explain
from your point of view?

04:42.148 --> 04:43.816
{\an9}Mm-mmm.
Mm-mmm.

04:43.883 --> 04:46.486
Well, what happened was,
everybody was trying to,

04:46.552 --> 04:48.688
you know, attack Moniece
about her motherhood,

04:48.755 --> 04:51.424
{\an8}which I think
is out of bounds.

04:51.491 --> 04:53.526
{\an8}I didn't attack Moniece
about nothing.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.695
T.T., I commented on
motherhood, period,

04:55.762 --> 04:56.929
because I'm a mother
and it hits home for me.

04:56.996 --> 04:58.197
Okay, that's what
I was saying, so what--

04:58.264 --> 04:59.599
So I was--
when I spoke,

04:59.666 --> 05:01.367
{\an1}when Nina asked me,
"Did you have something to say,"

05:01.434 --> 05:03.102
I said, "This is not for her."

05:03.169 --> 05:04.404
I was speaking in general,

05:04.470 --> 05:06.472
because I take motherhood
so passionately.

05:06.539 --> 05:08.041
{\an1}It's the best thing
that ever happened in my life.

05:08.107 --> 05:09.509
You know that.

05:09.575 --> 05:11.210
Brandi, you just look--
I mean, you're shaking.

05:11.277 --> 05:13.680
Do you-- what else is
upsetting you right now?

05:13.746 --> 05:15.682
Nothing, I'm--
you know what, Nina?

05:15.748 --> 05:18.084
I'm a good person,

05:18.151 --> 05:20.887
I'm gonna be a good wife
to my husband,

05:20.953 --> 05:22.422
and I'm gonna fall in line.

05:22.488 --> 05:25.058
{\an1}I'm gonna sit my ass here
and fall the (bleep) in line,

05:25.124 --> 05:26.225
'cause I'm hot right now.

05:26.292 --> 05:28.828
But I'm a lady,
and I'm God's child.

05:28.895 --> 05:30.997
I'm a mother.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.032
Like, for real.

05:33.099 --> 05:35.001
{\an4}(Marla)
Can I speak right here?

05:33.099 --> 05:35.001
(Nina) Okay.

05:35.068 --> 05:39.772
{\an7}Out of respect for
every mother in this room,

05:39.839 --> 05:41.774
Moniece has had
her struggles.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.943
Everybody deals
with something.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.613
It-- it is not the way that
I would have dealt with it,

05:47.680 --> 05:49.415
but that is still
my daughter.

05:49.482 --> 05:50.450
(Nina)
Right.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.285
{\an1}And so--
and I respect you ladies.

05:52.351 --> 05:54.954
And so what I was saying is,
I'm never coming for anybody,

05:55.021 --> 05:57.990
but I have to shield my child,
'cause at the end of the day,

05:58.057 --> 05:59.592
I can't sit here

05:59.659 --> 06:03.096
{\an1}and watch somebody
jump on my daughter.

06:03.162 --> 06:04.497
I get what you're saying.

06:04.564 --> 06:07.700
Princess, you were like a ninja,
you came from the side.

06:07.767 --> 06:10.336
{\an8}What-- fast.
I barely saw you.

06:10.403 --> 06:11.571
{\an7}I have my own personal issues
with Moniece,

06:11.637 --> 06:12.939
and I said I wasn't
gonna get physical,

06:13.005 --> 06:14.841
{\an1}but I got my girl's back
at the end of the day.

06:14.907 --> 06:16.242
And I got your back
and that's that.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.411
What are your issues
with Moniece?

06:18.478 --> 06:20.947
{\an4}She just has so much
to say about me and
I don't even know her.

06:21.013 --> 06:22.215
{\an1}Didn't Teairra
throw a drink at her?

06:22.281 --> 06:24.684
So you just had--
took your opportunity?

06:24.751 --> 06:25.785
{\an1}I mean, it's either
gonna happen now

06:25.852 --> 06:28.521
{\an1}or after the show
or a week from now.

06:30.923 --> 06:32.625
{\an5}(Nina)
Moniece, I know that
you felt attacked.

06:32.692 --> 06:34.160
I want to give you the floor.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.862
Is there anything that you'd
like to address or clear up?

06:39.165 --> 06:40.633
All right.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.235
Teairra, do you feel like
your friend is being attacked?

06:42.301 --> 06:45.838
{\an1}I feel like everybody's coming
at her at once, absolutely.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.441
{\an5}Yeah.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.441
(Nina) Okay.

06:48.508 --> 06:51.477
(Teairra)
I feel like-- I was confused.

06:51.544 --> 06:52.812
I'm still confused.

06:52.879 --> 06:56.015
{\an1}I don't know where you guys'
beef started, you know?

06:56.082 --> 06:59.986
It just seems like everybody has
a different issue with Moniece.

07:00.052 --> 07:03.022
And they're all attacking her
at once, and that's not cool.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.857
{\an5}(Nina)
Okay, I think it's
time to move on.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.492
All right, now,
this season,

07:06.559 --> 07:07.994
it got a little hard to tell

07:08.060 --> 07:09.729
whether we were
in England or Hollywood,

07:09.796 --> 07:11.397
because it seemed
like somebody

07:11.464 --> 07:13.900
was always trying
to spill some tea.

07:13.966 --> 07:15.568
Just watch.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.603
Having worked with Hazel
because, you know,

07:17.670 --> 07:18.771
she used to be
a publicist, so...

07:18.838 --> 07:19.772
{\an8}No, she didn't.

07:19.839 --> 07:20.873
{\an8}You know, like an intern,

07:20.940 --> 07:21.908
{\an8}somebody you find
off the Internet

07:21.974 --> 07:23.209
{\an7}that doesn't
have much to do,

07:23.276 --> 07:25.044
{\an7}so you get them to come
and work for you for free.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.647
{\an7}She took that and ran with it,
but she's not a publicist.

07:27.713 --> 07:28.948
{\an8}You're mad
'cause you've never

07:29.015 --> 07:32.084
{\an8}escalated to a high-end
blog that people--

07:34.320 --> 07:35.555
{\an8}(Jason)
Eat that, bitch.

07:35.621 --> 07:36.856
{\an8}That was really, really,
really a sucker-ass move.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.291
{\an8}But you weren't there.

07:38.357 --> 07:40.993
{\an8}It doesn't matter, you don't--

07:38.357 --> 07:40.993
{\an8}You weren't-- Listen...

07:41.060 --> 07:42.361
{\an8}I'm not gonna talk
to your Chihuahua.

07:42.428 --> 07:44.263
{\an7}Chihuahua?
Hold on, baby.

07:44.330 --> 07:46.265
{\an8}You-- you started
the (bleep) with Haze!

07:46.332 --> 07:47.500
{\an3}(Bleep).

07:47.567 --> 07:49.101
You like water thrown on you?

07:49.168 --> 07:50.937
Listen,
you can scream in here.

07:51.003 --> 07:52.305
I'm gonna kill you online.

07:52.371 --> 07:55.474
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

07:55.541 --> 07:58.044
All right, please welcome
Jason Lee to the stage.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.478
Thank you.

07:59.545 --> 08:02.081
I know that you claim to be
a well-known blogger,

08:02.148 --> 08:03.149
but there are a lot of--

08:03.216 --> 08:04.717
Boo! Let's boo
that (bleep).

08:04.784 --> 08:06.118
He ain't no
well-known blogger.

08:06.185 --> 08:07.920
"Just 'cause you take
a picture with Lauryn Hill

08:07.987 --> 08:09.188
don't make you a Fugee."

08:09.255 --> 08:10.756
Just 'cause you write
celebrity news

08:10.823 --> 08:12.325
{\an5}does not make you
a journalist, bitch.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.325
(Jason) Go ahead, Nina.

08:12.391 --> 08:15.595
{\an7}First of all,
people in Hollywood
that know me know what I do.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.730
{\an4}There are people on this set
that are in the studio
every episode

08:17.797 --> 08:18.764
{\an1}and we haven't heard
a single yet.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.132
You're on this stage
because of me.

08:20.199 --> 08:21.534
But, nonetheless,

08:21.601 --> 08:24.503
{\an1}as far as what I've done
in Hollywood, people know that.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.639
{\an5}(Brandi)
Jason, you wasn't talking
about me baby, was you?

08:26.706 --> 08:28.074
Who you was talking about?
No, no, no, baby.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.475
Let him talk first.

08:29.542 --> 08:30.776
{\an1}We all get a chance
to come here to the reunion

08:30.843 --> 08:32.078
to get some redemption.

08:32.144 --> 08:33.446
{\an7}(Hazel)
Bitch-ass (bleep)
don't get redemption

08:33.511 --> 08:34.480
{\an7}that's throwing drinks
on females.

08:34.547 --> 08:35.748
{\an8}Hold on,
hey listen--

08:35.815 --> 08:37.917
{\an1}He don't get no mother
(bleep) redemption, bitch.

08:37.984 --> 08:40.052
(Ray J)
If a homie want to say,

08:40.119 --> 08:42.788
I'm sorry, let him
say I'm sorry, man.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.724
If he ain't trying to say
I'm sorry, then turn up.

08:44.790 --> 08:45.892
{\an1}(Jason)
Thank you, Ray.

08:45.958 --> 08:47.560
{\an5}Let him say something, man.

08:45.958 --> 08:47.560
{\an1}Thank you.

08:47.627 --> 08:48.594
{\an3}(Hazel-e)
Okay, Ray.

08:48.661 --> 08:50.663
I came to the reunion

08:50.730 --> 08:53.866
{\an1}specifically to apologize
to Hazel.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.167
It doesn't mean that
I have to like her,

08:55.234 --> 08:57.003
{\an1}but the way that
I embarrassed myself

08:57.069 --> 08:59.972
in front of America
was not appropriate.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.375
{\an1}So for that,
I am genuinely apologetic.

09:02.441 --> 09:04.477
{\an5}Hazel, do you accept
that apology?

09:02.441 --> 09:04.477
No.

09:04.543 --> 09:07.179
{\an1}He threw the drink and said,
"Eat that, bitch."

09:07.246 --> 09:09.448
Then went on the day
that the episode aired

09:09.515 --> 09:12.752
{\an1}around with
a "Eat That, Bitch" T-shirt.

09:12.818 --> 09:15.087
{\an1}So therefore how do you
apologize when you're trying

09:15.154 --> 09:16.122
to go ahead and monopolize--

09:16.188 --> 09:17.256
You're saying
he's profiting?

09:17.323 --> 09:19.258
Yeah, off of
throwing the drink.

09:19.325 --> 09:21.060
That's a fair question, she's
saying, how can you be sorry

09:21.127 --> 09:22.128
when you're profiting off
of her pain?

09:22.194 --> 09:24.397
{\an1}Absolutely.
What America didn't see,

09:24.463 --> 09:27.066
Hazel tried to shame me
for being gay.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.701
{\an1}She said,
"You're gay, you're fat,

09:28.768 --> 09:30.536
{\an1}you're sleeping with
this person who's not out."

09:30.603 --> 09:31.837
{\an1}At that moment,
what Hazel didn't know...

09:31.904 --> 09:33.072
Keep it 100.

09:33.139 --> 09:34.340
...was that I hadn't even had

09:34.407 --> 09:36.075
{\an1}the conversation
with my family yet,

09:36.142 --> 09:37.610
so when that happened--

09:37.677 --> 09:39.045
{\an1}Well, you shouldn't have
came your fat ass on the there

09:39.111 --> 09:41.113
{\an5}trying to come for me,
mother(bleep).

09:39.111 --> 09:41.113
{\an1}Hold on.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.615
{\an1}And I could-- and I could go
back and forth

09:42.682 --> 09:44.717
{\an1}and say you belong
on a box of Froot Loops.

09:44.784 --> 09:46.953
Why-- why did Jason
come for you?

09:47.019 --> 09:48.354
Is there a history
between the two of you?

09:48.421 --> 09:49.956
Why-- why did it
get to this level?

09:50.022 --> 09:51.724
There was no history.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.259
{\an6}He needed--

09:51.791 --> 09:53.259
I was confused.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.429
{\an1}He needed a reason to be
on the show, so therefore,

09:56.495 --> 09:59.065
{\an1}come for, you know what I'm
saying, the queen, and he did.

09:59.131 --> 10:00.633
{\an5}And he got his little--

09:59.131 --> 10:00.633
{\an3}I love her.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.302
{\an1}And he got his little
five minutes off of it.

10:03.369 --> 10:05.738
{\an1}I'm upset because
she tried to use it

10:05.805 --> 10:07.673
{\an1}as an opportunity
to shame me.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.442
You started shaming me!

10:09.508 --> 10:11.277
{\an1}No, no, no.
But Hazel's right, wait.

10:11.344 --> 10:15.047
Why did you feel the need to get
revenge on Jason for Hazel?

10:15.114 --> 10:17.049
To be honest
with you, Nina,

10:17.116 --> 10:20.019
I'm such a strong
believer in women

10:20.086 --> 10:23.122
that that just
disgusted me seeing that,

10:23.189 --> 10:24.657
and it frustrated me.

10:24.724 --> 10:26.425
Rather, I (bleep)
with Hazel,

10:26.492 --> 10:28.527
but it could have been
any damn body.

10:28.594 --> 10:30.529
That (bleep) was like,
don't do that.

10:30.596 --> 10:32.999
I immediately felt bad
about that situation,

10:33.065 --> 10:34.467
{\an8}but it was, you know--

10:34.533 --> 10:35.801
{\an8}And we talked on the phone
and we smashed that issue.

10:35.868 --> 10:37.269
{\an1}We did.

10:37.336 --> 10:38.738
{\an5}(Nina)
Okay, now, Hazel,
let me ask you this.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.172
He has apologized about it.

10:40.239 --> 10:41.874
Does it bother you
that he's a blogger?

10:41.941 --> 10:43.275
Can you respect
that part of it?

10:43.342 --> 10:45.945
It was on-- it was just the fact
that a man attacked me.

10:46.012 --> 10:48.714
{\an1}Like, I'm sitting there,
we're having a conversation,

10:48.781 --> 10:51.517
{\an1}you are saying tons
of negative stuff to me,

10:51.584 --> 10:54.387
{\an1}like, somebody, like, that
I really don't know like that.

10:54.453 --> 10:56.655
{\an1}Like, yeah, we know of each
other, we're all in Hollywood,

10:56.722 --> 10:58.290
{\an1}but damn,
like, when, like,

10:58.357 --> 11:00.626
{\an1}when was throwing drinks
on women cool?

11:00.693 --> 11:01.694
Like, it was Ciroc,
it burned my eyes.

11:01.761 --> 11:02.828
(Ray J)
But he apologized.

11:02.895 --> 11:05.431
{\an8}I don't give a damn, Ray.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.465
{\an1}Like, (bleep),
relax, like,

11:06.532 --> 11:08.034
you can't make me
want to forget--

11:08.100 --> 11:09.535
{\an5}(Ray J)
But if somebody can't learn
from they mistake?

11:09.602 --> 11:11.837
{\an1}I wasn't here for the apology
today, I already said that.

11:11.904 --> 11:13.072
The only reason the apology

11:13.139 --> 11:14.874
{\an1}came is 'cause he can't
take the heat.

11:14.940 --> 11:18.511
Did Jesus forgive?
Did Jesus forgive?

11:18.577 --> 11:19.879
Am I Jesus and are you?

11:19.945 --> 11:21.047
No, so shut up.

11:21.113 --> 11:22.915
(Nina)
All right, all right, moving on,

11:22.982 --> 11:25.484
it's break time,
but when the reunion returns,

11:25.551 --> 11:29.088
Nas and Nia's battle for
Soulja Boy's heart continues.

11:29.155 --> 11:31.857
(cheering and applause)

11:31.924 --> 11:33.325
{\an8}What happened
to you, honey?

11:33.392 --> 11:36.095
{\an7}At the end of the day, it's
about the mother(bleep) money.

11:36.162 --> 11:37.830
{\an8}Whose ass did you beat?

11:37.897 --> 11:39.565
{\an8}(all shouting)

11:46.005 --> 11:47.940
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

11:50.709 --> 11:55.347
{\an5}(Nina)
Welcome to part two of "Love &amp;
Hip Hop Hollywood The Reunion."

11:55.414 --> 11:58.417
Teairra and Nikki's fashion show
plans were on the right track

11:58.484 --> 12:01.487
until T.T.'s recovery
took longer than expected

12:01.554 --> 12:04.757
and Hazel and Princess
came in to pick up the slack.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.025
When Teairra returned,

12:06.092 --> 12:08.094
what ensued was far
from model behavior.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.929
Let's watch.

12:09.995 --> 12:13.432
{\an5}(Teairra)
Miss Nikki Baby and I have
joined forces to put together

12:13.499 --> 12:16.068
a fashion show to show off
my blazer line

12:16.135 --> 12:17.636
and her lingerie collection.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.006
Oh, my God, T.T.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.908
{\an7}You look like you're really
struggling today, girl.

12:22.975 --> 12:25.611
{\an7}I am.

12:22.975 --> 12:25.611
{\an8}Oh, I feel so bad.

12:25.678 --> 12:26.779
{\an8}(Hazel)
I gotta admit.

12:26.846 --> 12:29.014
{\an8}I got some major
alarm bells going off.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.117
{\an8}Teairra is looking
totally beat up

12:31.183 --> 12:32.651
{\an8}and these girls
have no clue

12:32.718 --> 12:34.687
{\an8}what they're doing with this
fashion show right now.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.689
{\an7}I've been meeting
with Princess,

12:36.755 --> 12:38.824
{\an7}and she's ready to launch
her swimwear line.

12:38.891 --> 12:41.227
{\an7}If we link up,
we're stronger as a force.

12:42.761 --> 12:43.896
{\an9}Hey, T.T.

12:43.963 --> 12:45.698
{\an7}I wanted to do
my stuff fit-to-size,

12:45.764 --> 12:47.133
{\an7}so I just brought
my patterns.

12:47.199 --> 12:50.302
{\an8}Wait, T., but when are
these gonna be done, bitch?

12:50.369 --> 12:52.238
{\an8}'Cause the fashion show,
we have, like, less than a week.

12:52.304 --> 12:53.739
{\an8}Yeah, they're gonna be done.

12:53.806 --> 12:55.107
{\an8}Just so you know,

12:55.174 --> 12:56.775
{\an7}'cause you know I was
doing this event with Princess.

12:56.842 --> 12:58.844
{\an8}Why would you guys
even want this energy

12:58.911 --> 12:59.879
{\an8}at your fashion show?

12:59.945 --> 13:01.547
{\an8}You disrespect everybody.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.082
{\an8}It can't be all of us.

13:03.149 --> 13:04.383
{\an8}It has to be you.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.551
{\an8}(Bleep) you.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.187
{\an8}I hope you mother(bleep)
die tomorrow.

13:08.254 --> 13:10.656
{\an8}(Bleep) that ho, I don't give
a (bleep) about that bitch.

13:10.723 --> 13:12.458
{\an8}Rest in peace,
Teairra Mari.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.895
{\an8}(Hazel)
Just when I thought everything
was finally running smoothly,

13:15.961 --> 13:17.496
{\an8}I get a text
from Teairra's ass.

13:17.563 --> 13:19.698
{\an8}She says she was
on her way to get even

13:19.765 --> 13:20.933
{\an8}for what happened
at the fitting.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.935
{\an8}I don't want to do it
no more and--

13:23.002 --> 13:25.004
{\an7}We got all these people
coming here to support you

13:25.070 --> 13:27.173
{\an8}and you just go--

13:25.070 --> 13:27.173
{\an9}Quit?

13:27.239 --> 13:29.708
{\an8}(woman)
So, Miss Princess Love,

13:29.775 --> 13:32.478
{\an8}let's bring out
the first pieces.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.079
{\an8}Oh, wait a minute.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.815
{\an8}Somebody's crashing the runway.
What's going on here, people?

13:36.882 --> 13:38.918
{\an8}Oh, we up in this bitch!

13:42.087 --> 13:43.122
(Nina)
Okay, all right.

13:43.189 --> 13:44.657
So, Nikki,
let me talk to you.

13:44.723 --> 13:47.459
The fashion show started out as
an idea between you and Teairra.

13:47.526 --> 13:49.628
Do you think it was
a little irresponsible for her

13:49.695 --> 13:52.598
to schedule her surgery
so close to the show?

13:52.665 --> 13:54.166
{\an1}The timing might
have not been right,

13:54.233 --> 13:55.768
{\an7}but I can't knock her
for doing something

13:55.834 --> 13:57.570
{\an7}that she really wanted to do,
you know what I'm saying?

13:57.636 --> 13:59.371
{\an1}And on top of that,
you know,

13:59.438 --> 14:02.308
I always knew that I work
best under pressure, baby.

14:02.374 --> 14:04.276
All right, Princess,
let's talk to you for a second.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.478
At the fitting, you kind of
did a confrontation.

14:06.545 --> 14:08.180
Did you feel that that was
a little out of place

14:08.247 --> 14:09.882
considering it was
really her event?

14:09.949 --> 14:11.550
{\an1}Hazel initially
came to me.

14:11.617 --> 14:13.919
{\an1}I didn't know that
Teairra even had a line.

14:13.986 --> 14:15.487
{\an1}I thought she was
a singer, so...

14:15.554 --> 14:16.889
I am a singer.

14:16.956 --> 14:19.091
{\an1}Yeah, so I didn't know
what was going on.

14:19.158 --> 14:20.593
Okay.
Let me ask you, Nikki.

14:20.659 --> 14:22.661
What did you think when
you saw Teairra walk in

14:22.728 --> 14:25.531
and she had
the unfinished blazers?

14:25.598 --> 14:26.765
How did that make you feel?

14:26.832 --> 14:29.068
{\an1}Honestly, when T.T.
walked in, I--

14:29.134 --> 14:31.003
{\an1}I didn't think
she was fully prepared,

14:31.070 --> 14:33.939
{\an1}but my biggest picture was,
like, I wasn't her enemy.

14:34.006 --> 14:35.507
I didn't go into
this against her.

14:35.574 --> 14:36.976
I was like,
we did this together.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.211
I know she felt a certain way
'cause Princess was doing it,

14:39.278 --> 14:40.446
but I was like,
you know,

14:40.512 --> 14:41.714
{\an1}if Princess can put that
(bleep) under the rug,

14:41.780 --> 14:43.649
{\an1}you should
be able to, too.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.351
{\an1}You know, I told her,
I was like,

14:45.417 --> 14:47.853
{\an4}"You know, let's put
our differences aside
and let's make this money."

14:47.920 --> 14:51.824
{\an5}And at the end of the day,
we can all work together
as awesome women (bleep).

14:51.890 --> 14:53.792
I just wanted some
notification, that's all.

14:53.859 --> 14:55.194
Milan, what did you think

14:55.261 --> 14:57.463
when you saw Teairra's models
crashing the show?

14:57.529 --> 15:00.499
{\an1}Actually, my initial
reaction was to be upset

15:00.566 --> 15:01.667
and react that way,

15:01.734 --> 15:03.769
{\an7}but we were in front of,
like, the shade--

15:03.836 --> 15:06.672
{\an7}It was so many blogs
and just so many outlets there,

15:06.739 --> 15:07.673
I couldn't express that.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.041
(Nina)
Okay, so, Hazel,

15:09.108 --> 15:10.776
why did you decide to quit
the fashion show there?

15:10.843 --> 15:12.678
{\an5}(Teairra)
Yeah, what happened
to you, honey?

15:12.745 --> 15:14.880
'Cause you wasn't
there when I was.

15:14.947 --> 15:17.850
{\an7}Well, because I knew you was
coming in to act the damn fool.

15:17.916 --> 15:19.418
{\an1}I didn't act
the fool though, boo.

15:19.485 --> 15:20.819
You stormed
the runway, honey.

15:20.886 --> 15:22.888
I had your back
though, Hazel.

15:22.955 --> 15:24.423
I had your back.

15:24.490 --> 15:25.691
{\an5}You came in there--

15:24.490 --> 15:25.691
{\an1}(Teairra)
But why did you leave?

15:25.758 --> 15:27.026
But because--

15:27.092 --> 15:30.763
because I felt like
I didn't want no drama,

15:30.829 --> 15:32.431
no B.S., like,
I'm not with the (bleep).

15:32.498 --> 15:33.666
I'm about the coin.

15:33.732 --> 15:35.434
So for the event
to just all fall down

15:35.501 --> 15:37.469
{\an5}while I was there,
I just-- I wasn't with
the (bleep) that day.

15:37.536 --> 15:39.672
{\an5}(Nina)
But you guys are good now?

15:37.536 --> 15:39.672
{\an1}Yeah.

15:39.738 --> 15:41.674
{\an1}And I'm sorry for saying
I wish you would die,

15:41.740 --> 15:42.741
{\an1}'cause I don't wish
you would die.

15:42.808 --> 15:44.243
{\an1}If you died,
then I'll die.

15:44.310 --> 15:45.511
(audience sighs)

15:45.577 --> 15:46.879
(Nina)
All right, this season,

15:46.945 --> 15:49.048
Nia waged a war
for Soulja's affection

15:49.114 --> 15:52.551
when her ex-best friend Nas
infiltrated their relationship.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.086
Both sides dropped bombs,

15:54.153 --> 15:57.089
but neither of Soulja's soldiers
were willing to stand down.

15:57.156 --> 15:58.891
(all laughing)

15:58.957 --> 16:01.460
{\an1}Everywhere we go,
there's women at the shows,

16:01.527 --> 16:02.928
{\an1}there's women
on your Instagram.

16:02.995 --> 16:04.330
You ain't got no side pieces?

16:04.396 --> 16:06.999
{\an1}Nia is my main girl,
but it's just like, bro,

16:07.066 --> 16:08.467
{\an1}when I'm on the road,
I'm on the road.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.803
Nia knows there's
other girls out there,

16:10.869 --> 16:12.237
but that's just
road treats, though.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.505
{\an8}What's the tea?

16:13.572 --> 16:15.007
{\an8}I went out with Teairra
the other day.

16:15.074 --> 16:16.675
{\an8}We have a meeting
with this girl,

16:16.742 --> 16:17.976
{\an8}and she's telling us,

16:18.043 --> 16:20.045
{\an8}"Oh, you know, I mess
around with Soulja."

16:20.112 --> 16:21.413
{\an8}You know her name?

16:21.480 --> 16:23.115
{\an8}Some girl,
her name is Nas.

16:23.182 --> 16:25.284
{\an8}Oh, my God.
This bitch.

16:25.351 --> 16:26.819
{\an7}I had a relationship
with Dre.

16:26.885 --> 16:28.187
{\an8}So you thought
he took you seriously.

16:28.253 --> 16:29.188
{\an8}That's what it was.

16:29.254 --> 16:30.689
{\an8}Did I think or,
no, did I know?

16:30.756 --> 16:32.691
{\an7}'Cause I was living
with him, sweetheart.

16:32.758 --> 16:36.762
{\an8}Right now, we're together,
so, baby, let it go.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.230
{\an7}You're not (bleep)
worth it, bitch.

16:38.297 --> 16:39.765
{\an7}You're a piece of (bleep) scum
underneath my toes.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.133
{\an8}I'm scum?
Bitch!

16:42.568 --> 16:45.537
{\an7}Bitch!
(Bleep), bitch!

16:45.604 --> 16:47.039
{\an8}So Nia knows
that you said

16:47.106 --> 16:49.208
{\an7}that you wanted to be with me
and our love is never gonna end?

16:49.274 --> 16:50.242
{\an8}Nia knows all of that?

16:50.309 --> 16:51.677
{\an8}Why you sitting
over here, then?

16:51.744 --> 16:53.579
{\an8}I don't have to be with
neither one of y'all.

16:53.645 --> 16:56.448
{\an8}I got a million (bleep)
on my (bleep).

16:56.515 --> 16:58.884
{\an7}You have so many bitches,
but you still hitting my phone.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.319
{\an8}You a lie.

17:00.386 --> 17:02.254
{\an7}You think I don't know where
that (bleep) been, bitch, bye.

17:02.321 --> 17:03.322
{\an8}You sit your fat ass
right there,

17:03.389 --> 17:04.390
{\an8}shut the (bleep) up.

17:04.455 --> 17:05.523
{\an8}I'm fat, bitch?!

17:05.590 --> 17:06.592
{\an8}You're (bleep) up, bitch!

17:09.361 --> 17:10.329
{\an8}(Bleep), bitch.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.634
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

17:17.536 --> 17:20.973
Joining me on stage,
please welcome Soulja Boy...

17:21.039 --> 17:23.342
(cheering and applause)

17:23.409 --> 17:24.410
...Nia...

17:24.476 --> 17:26.278
(cheering and applause)

17:28.414 --> 17:29.782
...and Nas.

17:29.848 --> 17:32.117
(cheering and applause)

17:32.184 --> 17:34.853
All right,
Nia, now, Soulja implies

17:34.920 --> 17:37.156
{\an8}that you guys have
an open relationship.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.156
{\an5}Absolutely not.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.958
{\an8}That's not how
you see things?

17:37.222 --> 17:39.958
{\an5}No, ma'am. No.

17:40.025 --> 17:41.760
{\an5}Okay.

17:40.025 --> 17:41.760
{\an1}Hell no.

17:41.827 --> 17:44.096
{\an5}(Nina)
Soulja, do you think you guys
are in an open relationship?

17:44.163 --> 17:45.998
No.

17:46.064 --> 17:48.267
{\an7}I ain't here for the games,
man, you know what I'm saying?

17:48.333 --> 17:51.336
{\an8}(Nina)
Okay, so on the show,
you said,

17:51.403 --> 17:53.672
"Nia knows the deal,"
you've mentioned road treats,

17:53.739 --> 17:56.442
{\an5}that sounds like
an open relationship.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.442
That ain't no open relationship.

17:56.508 --> 18:00.546
{\an5}What is it?

17:56.508 --> 18:00.546
That's me being on the road and
I got fans and I got groupies.

18:00.612 --> 18:02.948
I'm a rap star,
what you want me to do?

18:03.015 --> 18:04.650
Do you sleep with them?

18:04.716 --> 18:06.385
{\an3}No.

18:06.452 --> 18:08.487
(laughing)

18:08.554 --> 18:10.355
(Nina)
Let's be clear.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.124
You want me to sit up here
and lie to you?

18:12.191 --> 18:14.359
{\an5}I don't want you to lie, but--

18:12.191 --> 18:14.359
I love Nia, you know
what I'm saying?

18:14.426 --> 18:15.727
At the end of the day,
I love Nia.

18:15.794 --> 18:17.262
{\an5}Now, I know that you told Nas...

18:15.794 --> 18:17.262
Today.

18:17.329 --> 18:19.698
...that you wanted
to cut things off.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.200
When was the last time
you were with Soulja Boy,

18:21.266 --> 18:23.335
{\an8}when you guys hooked up?

18:21.266 --> 18:23.335
{\an8}It was a couple months ago.

18:23.402 --> 18:24.670
{\an8}Like two months ago, maybe.

18:24.736 --> 18:26.238
(Nina)
Nia, were you aware of that?

18:26.305 --> 18:28.841
Man, (bleep) all that.
Who cares?

18:28.907 --> 18:30.442
{\an5}(laughing)

18:28.907 --> 18:30.442
Who gives a (bleep)?

18:30.509 --> 18:31.477
(Nina)
A lot of people care.

18:31.543 --> 18:32.611
{\an1}Nobody give a (bleep).
So what?

18:32.678 --> 18:34.279
{\an1}She got (bleep)
two months ago, so what?

18:34.346 --> 18:36.281
{\an1}You not my girl, Nia my girl.
(Bleep) outta here.

18:36.348 --> 18:38.050
{\an1}I don't want you!
You think I give a (bleep)?

18:38.116 --> 18:40.185
{\an1}I don't want you either,
my (bleep)!

18:40.252 --> 18:41.987
The reason-- the reason--
the reason--

18:42.054 --> 18:43.755
{\an5}What did you have to ask me?

18:42.054 --> 18:43.755
So did you not--

18:43.822 --> 18:47.326
{\an1}So did you not tell me,
if I didn't end it with you,

18:47.392 --> 18:48.961
{\an1}Nia wouldn't be on the show,
I would be on the show.

18:49.027 --> 18:50.863
{\an5}Man, I'm getting money.

18:49.027 --> 18:50.863
You didn't say that?

18:50.929 --> 18:51.997
(Bleep) all that.
(Bleep) all that.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.432
You didn't say that?
You didn't say that?

18:53.499 --> 18:55.200
{\an1}(Bleep) all--
What you talking about?

18:55.267 --> 18:56.401
It's about that money.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.436
Did you say that,
did you say that?

18:57.503 --> 19:00.539
{\an1}It's about
the mother(bleep) money!

19:00.606 --> 19:01.840
{\an1}Throw it,
throw it.

19:01.907 --> 19:04.676
{\an1}I get mother(bleep) money?
You see this right here?

19:04.743 --> 19:06.445
{\an1}Y'all see what
the (bleep) this is?

19:06.512 --> 19:09.748
{\an1}At the end of the day, it's
about the mother(bleep) money.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.583
{\an1}Don't nothing move
but the mother(bleep) money.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.085
{\an1}What the (bleep)
is she talking about?

19:13.151 --> 19:15.220
{\an5}(Nina)
You got money, we know.

19:13.151 --> 19:15.220
I don't give a (bleep).

19:15.287 --> 19:18.290
{\an1}(Bleep) that.
(Bleep) all that.

19:18.357 --> 19:20.392
(Nina)
Okay, let me ask a question.

19:20.459 --> 19:23.028
{\an1}Get money!
Get money!

19:23.095 --> 19:25.531
{\an1}If you ain't getting money,
you ain't doing (bleep)!

19:25.597 --> 19:26.565
{\an1}Get money!

19:26.632 --> 19:28.367
{\an5}All right.

19:26.632 --> 19:28.367
Give a (bleep)!

19:28.433 --> 19:30.435
He's claiming you, he's saying
he's in love with you.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.337
She knows she loves--
She know I love her.

19:32.404 --> 19:34.339
{\an5}(Nina)
I'm gonna finish my statement.

19:32.404 --> 19:34.339
You finish, Nina, finish, Nina,

19:34.406 --> 19:35.941
{\an1}but this (bleep), this (bleep)--
I'm not here for the games.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.110
{\an1}After I beat her ass
on national television,

19:38.176 --> 19:39.811
you texted my phone
and told me you loved me.

19:39.878 --> 19:41.213
Whose ass did you beat, bitch?

19:41.280 --> 19:42.447
{\an1}'Cause you know
you didn't do (bleep).

19:42.514 --> 19:43.582
Who the (bleep)
pays attention to her?

19:43.649 --> 19:44.650
You're a joke.

19:44.716 --> 19:46.652
(cheering and applause)

19:49.888 --> 19:51.790
{\an8}Get off me!
Get off me!

19:51.857 --> 19:53.992
{\an8}You were going
to propose today?

19:54.059 --> 19:54.993
{\an8}You ain't (bleep).

20:04.269 --> 20:05.604
Whose ass did you beat, bitch?

20:05.671 --> 20:06.838
{\an1}'Cause you know
you ain't do (bleep).

20:06.905 --> 20:07.973
Who the (bleep)
pays attention to her?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.308
You're a joke.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.310
(cheering and applause)

20:18.584 --> 20:20.752
Get off me!
Get off me!

20:20.819 --> 20:21.820
Get off me, bitch!

20:21.887 --> 20:22.988
This (bleep) out of hand.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.424
{\an1}Yo, (bleep) that
(bleep) thirsty ass thot.

20:25.490 --> 20:27.859
I'll beat her ass.

20:31.029 --> 20:33.765
(all shouting)

20:33.832 --> 20:35.567
Yo, I'm gonna (bleep)
the bitch up.

20:35.634 --> 20:37.669
See how security's
saving her?

20:37.736 --> 20:39.571
{\an5}(man)
Everyone, please,
please, sit down.

20:39.638 --> 20:42.040
We need everyone
to calm down, please.

20:42.107 --> 20:44.042
(cheering and applause)

20:45.877 --> 20:48.347
{\an8}All right, things got crazy,
there's holes in the floor,

20:48.413 --> 20:50.983
so people had to be removed,

20:51.049 --> 20:52.884
Nia and Nas are no longer
on the stage,

20:52.951 --> 20:54.586
but we are gonna
keep it moving.

20:54.653 --> 20:56.888
{\an5}Soulja, you're still here,
so I'm gonna talk with you.

20:54.653 --> 20:56.888
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

20:56.955 --> 20:59.391
Now, let's change gears a little
bit, but before we do that,

20:59.458 --> 21:01.460
just to clarify,
although it seems like

21:01.526 --> 21:04.429
you've made that clear,
Nia is your lady, you're happy.

21:04.496 --> 21:06.231
{\an8}Period.

21:04.496 --> 21:06.231
{\an8}End of story.

21:06.298 --> 21:07.532
{\an8}Period.

21:06.298 --> 21:07.532
{\an9}Okay.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.635
{\an5}You know what I'm saying?

21:07.599 --> 21:09.635
Okay, I'll respect that.

21:09.701 --> 21:11.903
{\an1}Period.

21:11.970 --> 21:14.539
{\an8}Side hoes always
gonna be side hoes.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.875
{\an5}(Nina)
All right, so let's talk,
let's change gears,

21:16.942 --> 21:18.644
because you mentioned
on the show

21:18.710 --> 21:20.312
that you were
worth $25 million.

21:20.379 --> 21:21.713
And on social media,

21:21.780 --> 21:23.382
a lot of people had
something to say about that.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.183
They were saying
that it wasn't true.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.753
{\an5}What do you have
to say about that?

21:25.250 --> 21:27.753
Why-- Go check it, Google it.

21:27.819 --> 21:30.422
The (bleep)?
Go look it up.

21:30.489 --> 21:31.890
What the (bleep)
I gotta lie about?

21:31.957 --> 21:33.759
I'm gonna sit on public
mother(bleep) national TV

21:33.825 --> 21:35.060
and say some (bleep)
that ain't true?

21:35.127 --> 21:36.728
Google the (bleep),
I'm worth 25 million.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.764
But I'm not the type of --
that go around boasting it.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.932
{\an5}I had a few--

21:38.830 --> 21:40.932
(laughter)

21:40.999 --> 21:42.934
{\an5}(Nina)
I don't know--
I don't know about that part.

21:44.403 --> 21:46.104
Now, social media
also noticed

21:46.171 --> 21:48.206
that your tattoos are
going away on your face.

21:48.273 --> 21:49.941
{\an5}Are you getting those removed?

21:48.273 --> 21:49.941
Yeah, face--

21:50.008 --> 21:51.276
You know what I'm saying,
I gotta switch the moves up.

21:51.343 --> 21:52.778
People say I'm a thug,
I'm all this (bleep).

21:52.844 --> 21:54.379
{\an5}So you getting some...

21:52.844 --> 21:54.379
Yeah, it's laser--

21:54.446 --> 21:55.847
laser surgery,
you know what I'm saying?

21:55.914 --> 21:57.215
It is what it is.

21:57.282 --> 21:59.117
I made-- I made mistakes
when I was younger,

21:59.184 --> 22:01.386
{\an5}you know what I'm saying?

21:59.184 --> 22:01.386
(Nina) I thought it was makeup,
it looks great.

22:01.453 --> 22:02.788
Thank you,
you know what I'm saying?

22:02.854 --> 22:04.623
Laser surgery, I gotta
go back two more times

22:04.690 --> 22:06.858
to get them
all the way gone.

22:06.925 --> 22:08.627
All right, let me-- let me talk
to you a little bit, Nikki,

22:08.694 --> 22:10.362
because I know you had
your own inform--

22:10.429 --> 22:12.664
your own kind of
beef with Nas.

22:12.731 --> 22:14.366
When you confronted her,

22:14.433 --> 22:17.102
it was a very
strange situation

22:17.169 --> 22:19.271
because you called her
a side chick,

22:19.337 --> 22:21.773
you guys kinda
got into it and then...

22:21.840 --> 22:24.976
Something I've never really
seen before in a confrontation.

22:25.043 --> 22:26.745
She threw up?

22:26.812 --> 22:28.313
Take a look.

22:28.380 --> 22:29.815
{\an8}Get out of my face, baby.

22:28.380 --> 22:29.815
{\an7}No.

22:29.881 --> 22:31.450
{\an8}Now we really about
to have a problem.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.485
{\an8}You want to touch me
one more time?

22:33.552 --> 22:35.087
{\an8}Bitch!

22:37.055 --> 22:38.290
{\an8}Did you just throw up?

22:38.356 --> 22:40.258
{\an9}Girl, bye.

22:40.325 --> 22:42.561
{\an8}That was really cute.

22:42.627 --> 22:45.397
She nasty, she threw up
on you, Nikki.

22:45.464 --> 22:47.065
She is nasty as (bleep).

22:47.132 --> 22:48.934
Like, bitch,
you a (bleep) side ho.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.902
If he with this girl,
if he want to be with you,

22:50.969 --> 22:52.704
he would drop her, right?

22:52.771 --> 22:54.372
{\an5}I mean,
everybody agrees to that?

22:52.771 --> 22:54.372
Yes.

22:54.439 --> 22:55.674
{\an5}But he didn't.

22:54.439 --> 22:55.674
Yes.

22:55.741 --> 22:57.275
Obviously something not
adding up on your end.

22:57.342 --> 22:59.044
{\an1}I don't care if you was
the girlfriend two years ago,

22:59.111 --> 23:00.846
{\an1}one year ago, this (bleep)
morning, but guess what?

23:00.912 --> 23:02.380
{\an5}He's still with her.

23:00.912 --> 23:02.380
(Nina) I know that--

23:02.447 --> 23:04.750
{\an4}So guess what?
Move the (bleep) on.

23:02.447 --> 23:04.750
(Soulja Boy) Exactly.

23:04.816 --> 23:06.718
{\an5}You know what I'm saying?

23:04.816 --> 23:06.718
Let me ask you a question.

23:06.785 --> 23:08.787
With both Nas and Nia,
some very nasty things

23:08.854 --> 23:10.222
were said to them by you.

23:10.288 --> 23:12.691
Do you feel like you owe
either one of them an apology?

23:12.758 --> 23:15.827
{\an5}Come on, man, I apologize
to my girl a million times,
you know what I'm saying?

23:15.894 --> 23:17.696
All right, we gotta take
a break, but coming up,

23:17.763 --> 23:21.066
we find out the status of
Miles and Milan's relationship.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.702
When "Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood
The Reunion" returns.

23:23.769 --> 23:25.704
(cheering and applause)

23:28.840 --> 23:30.909
{\an8}Milan is desperate
for attention.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.909
{\an5}Whore, whore.

23:30.976 --> 23:32.844
{\an8}You ain't (bleep).

23:32.911 --> 23:35.247
{\an7}Are you retired now
from the dancing?

23:44.055 --> 23:45.991
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

23:47.425 --> 23:50.962
Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood The Reunion."

23:51.029 --> 23:52.864
No one in Hollywood's
emotional journey

23:52.931 --> 23:54.900
has more plot twists
than Amber's.

23:54.966 --> 23:56.668
She started with high hopes
of rekindling

23:56.735 --> 23:58.436
a romantic relationship
with Miles,

23:58.503 --> 24:01.306
but after he revealed
his secret love for Milan,

24:01.373 --> 24:04.009
things between the high school
sweethearts turned sour.

24:04.075 --> 24:05.410
Watch.

24:05.477 --> 24:08.013
I've been having issues

24:08.079 --> 24:09.848
with my sexual identity,

24:09.915 --> 24:12.284
um, and my feelings
towards the same sex.

24:12.350 --> 24:14.753
{\an8}Everybody was right,
everybody was right!

24:14.820 --> 24:17.589
{\an8}Everybody was right!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

24:17.656 --> 24:19.624
{\an8}Uh-uh, if this is a game,
then you guys can have--

24:19.691 --> 24:21.827
{\an8}(crying)

24:19.691 --> 24:21.827
{\an8}Come here, baby.

24:21.893 --> 24:24.663
{\an8}No!

24:21.893 --> 24:24.663
{\an8}Don't do it like that.

24:24.729 --> 24:27.032
{\an7}What he feels for you is real
and he loves you for real.

24:27.098 --> 24:30.068
{\an7}But I'm mad 'cause--
and he didn't tell me nothing

24:30.135 --> 24:33.371
{\an8}And then to me, it's like, don't
string me along this whole time.

24:33.438 --> 24:35.307
{\an8}Why involve me?

24:35.373 --> 24:36.875
{\an8}(Milan)
Every time I've asked
Miles about you,

24:36.942 --> 24:38.343
{\an8}it's, "Oh, that's
my best friend."

24:38.410 --> 24:39.878
{\an8}And I'm like, "Well,
you need to tell her."

24:38.410 --> 24:39.878
{\an4}Good.

24:39.945 --> 24:42.981
{\an8}I've been telling Miles from day
one, "I want to talk to Amber."

24:43.048 --> 24:44.482
{\an8}He tells me that
he's been trying to, like,

24:44.549 --> 24:47.452
{\an8}distance himself from you,
you won't let go.

24:47.519 --> 24:49.054
{\an8}I don't know if you know
that me and Miles

24:49.120 --> 24:51.089
{\an7}have been in a relationship
for, like, two years.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.824
{\an8}And we have
matching tattoos.

24:52.891 --> 24:55.060
{\an8}You know, he moved
into my house.

24:52.891 --> 24:55.060
{\an5}Oh.

24:55.126 --> 24:58.697
{\an7}I'm just so sorry, like,
I wish I didn't even have--

24:58.763 --> 25:00.131
{\an7}I wish we wasn't
going through this.

25:00.198 --> 25:01.333
{\an7}I wish I didn't
have these feelings.

25:01.399 --> 25:03.068
{\an8}I swear to God, like...

25:01.399 --> 25:03.068
{\an8}And I hear you.

25:03.134 --> 25:06.438
{\an8}I just want you to put all
the hurt that you did to me

25:06.504 --> 25:09.174
{\an8}and everything
that I did to you

25:09.241 --> 25:11.409
{\an8}in the past,
like, behind us.

25:09.241 --> 25:11.409
{\an4}Right.

25:11.476 --> 25:14.746
{\an8}Now, I'm gonna move on
and, you know, it's okay.

25:14.813 --> 25:17.382
{\an8}So we'll just
go from there.

25:17.449 --> 25:19.384
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

25:21.887 --> 25:26.424
Now, Miles, you have said that
you guys did have a family, so--

25:26.491 --> 25:29.094
And Amber considered you
to be a father to her daughter.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.464
Do you still consider
yourself Zoey's father?

25:32.530 --> 25:33.798
{\an3}Absolutely,
absolutely.

25:33.865 --> 25:36.067
{\an7}That's my baby,
and she's a kid, she does--

25:36.134 --> 25:37.535
{\an8}she's not even really
tripping off of it.

25:37.602 --> 25:39.004
{\an8}She's like, I love you.

25:37.602 --> 25:39.004
{\an9}I love you.

25:39.070 --> 25:41.239
{\an8}Let's go to the movies.

25:39.070 --> 25:41.239
{\an8}Still Snapchat, all that, yeah.

25:41.306 --> 25:43.742
{\an5}And you guys still consider
yourself a family.

25:41.306 --> 25:43.742
{\an3}Absolutely.

25:43.808 --> 25:45.510
{\an5}Well, a "framily."

25:43.808 --> 25:45.510
Okay, a "framily."

25:45.577 --> 25:47.212
A framily?
Like, for real?

25:47.279 --> 25:49.848
Amber, where do you and Miles
stand right now, though?

25:49.915 --> 25:51.483
{\an8}Right now, we're friends.

25:51.549 --> 25:52.817
{\an8}You're friends.

25:51.549 --> 25:52.817
{\an8}Yeah, we're friends.

25:52.884 --> 25:55.287
{\an7}But what about Milan?
Can we see where Milan stands?

25:55.353 --> 25:59.124
{\an4}'Cause he still has a story--
he still has a part
in the story, too.

25:59.190 --> 26:01.693
Milan, where do you
and Miles stand right now?

26:01.760 --> 26:04.996
Well, it's really touching
to sit here and, you know,

26:05.063 --> 26:08.099
{\an8}hear this story
about a person

26:08.166 --> 26:11.136
{\an8}who is struggling
between, you know,

26:11.202 --> 26:12.904
the person that
he's in love with,

26:12.971 --> 26:14.673
{\an8}which is allegedly
supposed to be me.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.608
{\an5}Um, and then--

26:14.739 --> 26:16.608
Ooh.

26:16.675 --> 26:18.843
{\an1}And then the person who
he used to be in love with,

26:18.910 --> 26:20.445
which was supposed
to be you.

26:20.512 --> 26:24.082
Um, and to
sit and watch,

26:24.149 --> 26:26.151
you know,
it all play out

26:26.217 --> 26:29.254
and, um, knowing that
I came on this show

26:29.321 --> 26:33.491
with all intentions to, um,
ask him to marry me today.

26:33.558 --> 26:36.328
{\an5}(Nina) Oh, wow.

26:33.558 --> 26:36.328
(audience ohhing)

26:36.394 --> 26:39.064
{\an6}But...

26:36.394 --> 26:39.064
So you have a ring?

26:39.130 --> 26:42.100
{\an5}You were gonna propose today?

26:39.130 --> 26:42.100
Yeah, I was gonna propose today,

26:42.167 --> 26:45.770
{\an4}but the whole time, Miles,
you've been cheating on me
with a whole 'nother person.

26:45.837 --> 26:47.906
{\an5}(audience oohing)

26:45.837 --> 26:47.906
(Nina) Wait a minute.

26:47.973 --> 26:49.541
So...
it's another dude.

26:49.607 --> 26:52.243
{\an5}There's another man involved?

26:49.607 --> 26:52.243
Absolutely not.

26:52.310 --> 26:54.012
But you going around here
cheating on the person

26:54.079 --> 26:56.147
you're supposed to be in love
with, the person you broke--

26:56.214 --> 26:59.050
You came and told your family,
you came and told your sister,

26:59.117 --> 27:00.485
you came and told your ex.

27:00.552 --> 27:02.954
{\an1}All of that (bleep) is
bull(bleep), you're a fraud.

27:03.021 --> 27:04.255
{\an5}No, he's not, no he's not!

27:03.021 --> 27:04.255
You a fraud-ass (bleep).

27:04.322 --> 27:05.757
{\an5}Shut your ass up.

27:04.322 --> 27:05.757
And that's what you is.

27:05.824 --> 27:07.592
{\an4}(Miles)
First of all, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

27:07.659 --> 27:09.327
{\an1}(Milan)
And that's all I got to say.

27:09.394 --> 27:10.729
What-- Look, look.

27:10.795 --> 27:12.797
What we're-- what I'm not--
what I'm not gonna do--

27:12.864 --> 27:14.399
{\an5}I'm just gonna let you--

27:12.864 --> 27:14.399
We have stuck to
our story, okay.

27:14.466 --> 27:15.967
{\an1}I'm gonna let you talk,
and I'm gonna let you know,

27:16.034 --> 27:17.302
that you ain't (bleep).

27:17.369 --> 27:18.970
(audience oohing)

27:22.741 --> 27:25.010
{\an5}There go the ring. Church.

27:22.741 --> 27:25.010
Bye-bye.

27:25.076 --> 27:27.312
{\an5}Church.

27:25.076 --> 27:27.312
(Nina) Can you respond
to his allegation?

27:27.379 --> 27:29.414
That's totally false.
I love Milan.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.982
{\an5}And if he feels like--

27:29.481 --> 27:30.982
(Nina) So can you talk about--

27:31.049 --> 27:32.951
Are you and Milan
completely done?

27:33.018 --> 27:34.986
{\an5}I'm done, I'm done.

27:33.018 --> 27:34.986
{\an1}All right.

27:35.053 --> 27:37.055
Milan has just
left the stage.

27:37.122 --> 27:40.025
We'll be right back with "Love &amp;
Hip Hop Hollywood The Reunion."

27:40.091 --> 27:42.027
(cheering and applause)

27:43.895 --> 27:46.131
{\an8}(sobbing)

27:55.840 --> 27:57.575
{\an8}You a (bleep) cheater.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.575
{\an9}You're mad.

27:57.642 --> 27:58.843
{\an8}No, you're mad.

27:57.642 --> 27:58.843
{\an9}You upset.

27:58.910 --> 28:00.278
{\an7}I am mad, because
I gave you everything.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.913
{\an8}Milan is desperate
for attention.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.913
{\an5}Whore, whore!

28:01.980 --> 28:04.049
{\an8}I put my shoes up,
but you never know.

28:04.115 --> 28:06.184
{\an8}You're a ho!

28:04.115 --> 28:06.184
{\an8}(audience oohing)

28:14.292 --> 28:16.061
(cheering and applause)

28:16.127 --> 28:18.997
{\an5}(Nina)
Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip Hop
Hollywood The Reunion."

28:19.064 --> 28:21.066
{\an8}Milan has joined us
back on the stage.

28:21.132 --> 28:22.700
{\an8}And, Milan,
I know things got heated,

28:22.767 --> 28:24.502
but I do want to talk to you
for a little bit.

28:24.569 --> 28:27.439
Um, I know that emotions
are high right now.

28:27.505 --> 28:29.707
Do you feel like you're
the forgotten person

28:29.774 --> 28:31.709
in Miles' coming out story?

28:31.776 --> 28:33.144
{\an1}How could I be
the forgotten person?

28:33.211 --> 28:35.680
{\an1}I didn't come out, so that
was Miles' coming out story.

28:35.747 --> 28:38.183
So I have nothing
to do with that.

28:38.249 --> 28:40.552
I-- I think him coming out,

28:40.618 --> 28:42.754
um, is important for

28:42.821 --> 28:44.422
{\an1}the demographic that
watches this show.

28:44.489 --> 28:46.891
Milan, let me know,
what did it feel like for you

28:46.958 --> 28:50.061
to be the first African-American
gay man featured on the show?

28:50.128 --> 28:52.097
Um, I thought it was good.
I thought it was pioneering.

28:52.163 --> 28:54.599
Just like I thought the story
of a male coming out

28:54.666 --> 28:56.267
on television was
groundbreaking.

28:56.334 --> 28:59.370
Because being gay
is the worst thing

28:59.437 --> 29:01.473
{\an1}that you could possibly be
in our community.

29:01.539 --> 29:03.041
There was times
when I was growing up

29:03.108 --> 29:05.477
that I wanted to kill myself
because I had nowhere to turn.

29:05.543 --> 29:07.545
Everywhere I went,
they turned their back on me,

29:07.612 --> 29:09.547
so I had no one
to look up to.

29:09.614 --> 29:11.382
{\an1}I had to find
the strength in myself

29:11.449 --> 29:13.351
{\an1}and become the person
who I am today.

29:13.418 --> 29:16.187
(applause)

29:16.254 --> 29:18.490
Now, out of
all your endeavors,

29:18.556 --> 29:20.391
what are you
most proud of?

29:20.458 --> 29:22.160
That I'm still here.

29:22.227 --> 29:25.063
{\an5}You have to be
a very strong person
to deal with this situation.

29:25.130 --> 29:27.866
It's so heartbreaking
to be able to sit here

29:27.932 --> 29:29.367
and be successful

29:29.434 --> 29:31.236
because there's
so many people that are not.

29:31.302 --> 29:34.105
There's so many homeless gay
people on the streets right now

29:34.172 --> 29:36.074
because they have
nowhere to go.

29:36.141 --> 29:37.609
This is not--

29:37.675 --> 29:39.611
{\an1}This community, we need
to do better for each other.

29:39.677 --> 29:40.812
We're supposed to
love each other.

29:40.879 --> 29:42.847
All lives matter.
Gay lives matter.

29:42.914 --> 29:45.683
(applause)

29:45.750 --> 29:48.386
{\an5}(Nina)
Now, Milan, at the start
of the season,

29:48.453 --> 29:51.422
how did you envision
your future with Miles?

29:51.489 --> 29:53.091
(Milan)
You know, um,

29:53.158 --> 29:56.060
I've been telling Hazel for
the last two and a half years,

29:56.127 --> 29:58.163
{\an1}you know, that Miles
is the person

29:58.229 --> 30:00.031
{\an1}I want to spend the rest
of my life with, you know?

30:00.098 --> 30:01.699
A person I want to
build my future with.

30:01.766 --> 30:04.335
You know, I fell in love
with a person

30:04.402 --> 30:07.071
who showed me
that he was one way

30:07.138 --> 30:10.842
and I was willing
to follow that

30:10.909 --> 30:14.179
{\an1}and do everything and
anything to protect that.

30:14.245 --> 30:17.582
{\an6}Okay.

30:14.245 --> 30:17.582
You know, but that was
my mistake as a human being

30:17.649 --> 30:19.584
{\an5}because you can't help
who you fall in love with.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.584
{\an3}Okay.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.686
I loved him unconditionally.

30:21.753 --> 30:25.190
I was there when nobody else
was there, I played my part.

30:25.256 --> 30:27.892
I disrespected myself
by allowing myself

30:27.959 --> 30:29.794
{\an5}to be in a relationship
with somebody for two
and a half years

30:29.861 --> 30:30.962
that never even claimed me.

30:31.029 --> 30:33.131
So there's no future
for a person

30:33.198 --> 30:35.733
who continues to lie
and think it's okay.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.902
He hurt me, he hurt her,

30:37.969 --> 30:40.872
he hurt everybody around us,
because he's selfish.

30:40.939 --> 30:42.974
I don't deserve that,
and nobody does.

30:43.041 --> 30:45.043
(applause)

30:45.109 --> 30:47.645
{\an5}Milan is desperate
for attention.

30:45.109 --> 30:47.645
Whore, whore.

30:47.712 --> 30:49.247
{\an4}No, you're desperate
for attention...

30:47.712 --> 30:49.247
{\an3}Go ahead.

30:49.314 --> 30:51.015
{\an4}...with your pity party ass
and this bull(bleep).

30:49.314 --> 30:51.015
Go ahead.

30:51.082 --> 30:54.519
{\an4}You've portrayed all these
mother(bleep) like you're
this innocent person.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.321
{\an5}You a (bleep) cheater.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.321
{\an3}You're mad.

30:56.387 --> 30:57.722
{\an5}No, you're mad.

30:56.387 --> 30:57.722
You're upset.

30:57.789 --> 30:58.923
{\an1}I am mad because
I gave you everything.

30:58.990 --> 31:00.491
(Nina)
Let's ask some real questions,

31:00.558 --> 31:02.827
because you came here today and
you came to propose to Miles.

31:02.894 --> 31:04.395
{\an5}No, no, no, no.

31:02.894 --> 31:04.395
{\an3}(Bleep) no.

31:04.462 --> 31:06.264
{\an5}I didn't come today
to propose to him.

31:04.462 --> 31:06.264
That's another lie.

31:06.331 --> 31:08.600
{\an5}That's what I anticipated.

31:06.331 --> 31:08.600
That's what you envisioned,
to propose to him.

31:08.666 --> 31:11.336
{\an5}Milan been mad.

31:08.666 --> 31:11.336
You're a ho!

31:11.402 --> 31:12.470
{\an5}What are you talking about?

31:11.402 --> 31:12.470
You're just jealous!

31:12.537 --> 31:14.005
{\an1}Like, I'm just--
Jealous of you for what?

31:14.072 --> 31:15.773
You don't even
have a song on iTunes.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.875
Why would I
be jealous of you?

31:17.942 --> 31:19.811
(audience oohing)

31:19.877 --> 31:21.446
Google me.

31:21.512 --> 31:23.014
{\an5}All right, all right,
moving on.

31:21.512 --> 31:23.014
And Google Sir Brock.

31:23.081 --> 31:24.349
{\an5}Talking about a ho.

31:23.081 --> 31:24.349
(Nina) Calm down.

31:24.415 --> 31:25.917
You ain't got a Wikipedia page.

31:25.984 --> 31:27.452
(Nina)
All right, y'all.

31:27.518 --> 31:30.021
Willie and Shanda moved to L.A.
with a suitcase full of dreams,

31:30.088 --> 31:31.689
a mailbox full of bills

31:31.756 --> 31:34.692
and a bank account
full of nothing at all.

31:34.759 --> 31:36.628
With Willie's
stalled solo career

31:36.694 --> 31:38.029
not bringing in much cash,

31:38.096 --> 31:41.332
his wife offered to return
to her stripper past.

31:41.399 --> 31:42.634
Take a look.

31:42.700 --> 31:44.202
(Shanda)
Willie and I moved to L.A.

31:44.269 --> 31:46.371
We figured we can live off of
our savings for six months.

31:46.437 --> 31:48.106
{\an8}(Willie)
The truth of the matter
is this--

31:48.172 --> 31:49.941
{\an8}If my solo career
doesn't succeed,

31:50.008 --> 31:51.809
{\an8}then it's gonna be
a lot of people suffering.

31:51.876 --> 31:54.445
{\an8}(Shanda)
See these bills?
Making me nervous.

31:54.512 --> 31:56.814
{\an8}Why you nervous?

31:54.512 --> 31:56.814
{\an8}Because they're not paid.

31:56.881 --> 31:59.050
{\an7}I'm making money, Shanda,
but right now, I'm telling you.

31:59.117 --> 32:00.885
{\an8}Where is it?

32:00.952 --> 32:03.821
{\an8}Because I can go out and I can
actually make money every day.

32:03.888 --> 32:06.124
{\an7}However, you're not
going back to doing that.

32:06.190 --> 32:08.359
{\an8}Back in Chicago,
I was an exotic dancer,

32:08.426 --> 32:11.396
{\an8}but after having the kids,
Willie didn't want me
doing it anymore.

32:11.462 --> 32:13.031
{\an8}(Willie)
Screw and I go way back,

32:13.097 --> 32:15.133
{\an8}so he knows a little bit
about my current record deal.

32:15.199 --> 32:16.467
{\an8}I got locked into a contract.

32:16.534 --> 32:18.436
{\an8}The problem is,
the money's dried up,

32:18.503 --> 32:21.072
{\an8}my album's been put on ice,
and I'm starting to panic.

32:21.139 --> 32:23.608
{\an7}I just want to find out
what was the options of me
coming-- even over this way?

32:23.675 --> 32:25.476
{\an8}In order for me
to do anything for you,

32:25.543 --> 32:27.779
{\an8}you gotta get yourself
up out of that situation.

32:27.845 --> 32:29.981
{\an7}Is it possible
to give me a release?

32:30.048 --> 32:32.150
{\an8}That's a pretty tough thing

32:32.216 --> 32:35.153
{\an8}for you to hit us
with right now.

32:35.219 --> 32:36.654
{\an7}Did you ever get out
of the contract?

32:36.721 --> 32:38.323
{\an8}You're talking about with Harry?

32:36.721 --> 32:38.323
{\an7}Yeah.

32:38.389 --> 32:40.558
{\an8}Yeah, we good.

32:38.389 --> 32:40.558
{\an7}It's done, he--
you know, you out.

32:40.625 --> 32:41.993
{\an8}We're done, we good.

32:42.060 --> 32:43.728
{\an8}Yo, your boo is tripping.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.530
{\an8}What's wrong with him?

32:45.596 --> 32:48.132
{\an8}He's just pissed off
'cause he can't get out
that Harry contract.

32:48.199 --> 32:50.068
{\an8}(Shanda)
Damn, what the hell?

32:50.134 --> 32:52.103
{\an8}Willie looked me in my eyes
and lied to me?

32:52.170 --> 32:54.205
{\an8}Now, that (bleep) hurt.

32:54.272 --> 32:55.673
{\an8}I'm gonna do
what I know how to do.

32:57.241 --> 32:59.344
{\an7}Ain't that my boy
Willie's wife?

32:59.410 --> 33:01.446
{\an8}She's been doing part-time.

33:01.512 --> 33:03.314
{\an8}She just started.

33:01.512 --> 33:03.314
{\an8}Yo, stop playing.

33:03.381 --> 33:04.749
{\an8}Are you ready
to kill it or what?

33:04.816 --> 33:06.517
{\an8}Be prepared
to be entertained.

33:06.584 --> 33:08.453
{\an7}Shanda entertains me enough
on the stage, okay?

33:08.519 --> 33:11.589
{\an8}What happened?

33:08.519 --> 33:11.589
{\an7}I know, she was up there,
I was like, is that Shanda?

33:11.656 --> 33:13.758
{\an7}I'm like, "Oh, I can't
even look at that."

33:13.825 --> 33:16.994
{\an8}Where?

33:13.825 --> 33:16.994
{\an7}You know, Shanda been dancing
for us in one of my clubs.

33:18.496 --> 33:19.731
{\an8}Oh, (bleep).

33:19.797 --> 33:21.632
{\an8}You lied to me.

33:19.797 --> 33:21.632
{\an8}Okay, I was working on it.

33:21.699 --> 33:23.167
{\an8}However, I didn't ask you
for no damn help.

33:23.234 --> 33:24.702
{\an8}So why would
you go dance?

33:24.769 --> 33:26.671
{\an8}Did you discuss with me that you
didn't get out of that contract

33:26.738 --> 33:28.339
{\an8}when I (bleep) asked you?

33:28.406 --> 33:30.141
{\an8}The fact that you think that
it's okay for you to go dance

33:30.208 --> 33:31.676
{\an8}after I told you that
you shouldn't go do it.

33:31.743 --> 33:33.177
{\an8}I don't give a (bleep).
What? What? What?

33:33.244 --> 33:34.979
{\an8}And you didn't even let me know.

33:33.244 --> 33:34.979
{\an8}So I'm finding out now.

33:35.046 --> 33:36.681
{\an7}So-- so-- so we can be
in a (bleep) up situation?

33:35.046 --> 33:36.681
{\an5}So I'm finding out now.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.282
{\an7}I'm never gonna allow that
to happen.

33:38.349 --> 33:39.584
{\an8}Okay, well, go do that
(bleep) by yourself, then.

33:39.650 --> 33:41.018
{\an7}What the (bleep) that
supposed to mean?

33:41.085 --> 33:42.453
{\an8}Get the (bleep) out
and do it yourself.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.588
{\an7}Willie, I'm not finna do it
right now with your dumb butt.

33:43.654 --> 33:45.757
{\an8}I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

33:48.159 --> 33:50.094
{\an8}(cheering and applause)

33:52.463 --> 33:55.333
Please welcome Willie
and Shanda to the stage.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.001
(cheering and applause)

33:59.237 --> 34:01.038
All right, so, Willie,
if you guys

34:01.105 --> 34:03.007
weren't in the best
financial situation,

34:03.074 --> 34:04.842
if things were a little rocky,
why move to L.A.?

34:04.909 --> 34:06.944
Why not wait and build
a bit of a savings first?

34:07.011 --> 34:08.846
{\an8}Well, you know, first off,

34:08.913 --> 34:10.848
{\an8}I mean, let me clear it up for
you and the rest of the world.

34:10.915 --> 34:12.550
{\an5}I've never been broke.

34:10.915 --> 34:12.550
(Nina) Okay.

34:12.617 --> 34:14.752
{\an4}Ever.

34:12.617 --> 34:14.752
So to clear it up,
you weren't broke,

34:14.819 --> 34:16.387
but you were anticipating
the future.

34:16.454 --> 34:17.722
You were afraid of
draining your savings.

34:17.789 --> 34:18.989
{\an8}Exactly.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.224
{\an8}I just wanted to be comfortable.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.224
{\an8}(Willie) Yeah.

34:20.291 --> 34:21.659
So it wasn't no
payday loan situation.

34:21.726 --> 34:22.793
{\an5}Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

34:21.726 --> 34:22.793
Hell no.

34:22.860 --> 34:25.362
{\an5}Hell nah.

34:22.860 --> 34:25.362
All right, so, Shanda,

34:25.429 --> 34:28.900
it seems like you had a really
hard time trusting Willie.

34:28.966 --> 34:32.503
Why is it that you couldn't just
take his word for it and wait?

34:32.570 --> 34:34.772
You know what? It's not
that I couldn't trust him,

34:34.839 --> 34:37.742
'cause I know that he will
deliver, I just panicked.

34:37.809 --> 34:39.610
That's all.
You know, we moved from Chicago

34:39.677 --> 34:42.112
and we were miles away
from my family,

34:42.179 --> 34:44.348
so I didn't have a comfort,
so I just pre--

34:44.415 --> 34:45.750
you know,
I panicked, period.

34:45.817 --> 34:48.085
Now, how did you feel,
Willie, finding out

34:48.152 --> 34:50.588
the way that you did,
that she went back to dancing?

34:50.655 --> 34:52.924
That was horrible,
that's the worst way

34:52.989 --> 34:55.025
{\an5}you ever want to find out.

34:52.989 --> 34:55.025
{\an1}My bad.

34:55.092 --> 34:57.228
To being, you know, in your vibe
and thinking that you finna

34:57.295 --> 34:58.896
{\an1}just have a regular conversation
and then hear something

34:58.963 --> 35:00.765
that you definitely should have
been the first person to know,

35:00.832 --> 35:02.800
not know, of course, it was--

35:02.867 --> 35:04.202
It was devastating, but at
the end of the day, you know,

35:04.268 --> 35:05.636
{\an1}that's my baby,
and she gonna make mistakes,

35:05.703 --> 35:07.171
I'm gonna make mistakes.

35:07.238 --> 35:08.773
{\an1}And we just gotta figure it out,
you know what I mean?

35:08.840 --> 35:11.008
(audience awwing)

35:11.075 --> 35:12.610
(Nina)
I have a question for you Ray J.

35:12.677 --> 35:14.745
Would you still respond--
would you respond the same way

35:14.812 --> 35:17.048
Willie did if you saw
Princess dancing?

35:17.114 --> 35:19.050
(laughter)

35:21.986 --> 35:25.189
{\an8}Listen, everybody got their own
situations that they go through.

35:25.256 --> 35:26.858
You know what I'm saying?

35:26.924 --> 35:28.693
But I have got myself
in the hole,

35:28.759 --> 35:30.862
but at the time
when I was in the hole,

35:30.928 --> 35:32.797
I had to dig
myself out myself.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.799
I didn't have a girl
and a family, but I don't know.

35:34.866 --> 35:38.436
You never know what we gotta do,
like, bills is for real.

35:38.503 --> 35:41.205
{\an5}That's true.

35:38.503 --> 35:41.205
Like, you could
make $10 million,

35:41.272 --> 35:43.875
if you got bills
that flips that budget,

35:43.941 --> 35:45.743
you can go broke in,
like, a week.

35:45.810 --> 35:48.179
As long as they together now
and they got through

35:48.246 --> 35:50.081
the ups and downs,
that's all that really matter.

35:50.147 --> 35:51.549
'Cause it's gonna be
ups and downs,

35:51.616 --> 35:54.085
so if you get through
the rough times over and over,

35:54.151 --> 35:55.620
then you know that
that's the one for you.

35:55.686 --> 35:57.955
'Cause most times, people can't
survive through the rough times.

35:58.022 --> 36:00.391
{\an5}(applause)

35:58.022 --> 36:00.391
(Nina)
All right, Brother Ray J.

36:00.458 --> 36:01.959
Let you preach a little bit.

36:04.128 --> 36:06.264
Acting like the mayor today,
all right.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.065
Well...

36:08.132 --> 36:10.535
{\an5}(Nina)
All right, now, Fizz,
let me ask you,

36:10.601 --> 36:12.570
{\an1}What were your thoughts
when you saw Shanda dancing?

36:12.637 --> 36:15.239
I was like, oh, (bleep).

36:15.306 --> 36:17.208
{\an5}(laughter)

36:15.306 --> 36:17.208
(Nina)
You were a little embarrassed?

36:17.275 --> 36:18.943
{\an5}Were you embarrassed?

36:17.275 --> 36:18.943
Embarrassed to--

36:19.010 --> 36:20.177
{\an8}Oh, when I said something?

36:19.010 --> 36:20.177
{\an8}You didn't want--

36:20.244 --> 36:21.479
{\an8}'Cause you said
you didn't want to look.

36:21.546 --> 36:24.515
{\an8}No, yeah, I didn't want to look.

36:21.546 --> 36:24.515
{\an8}(laughter)

36:24.582 --> 36:26.851
So tell me now, what is
going on with your music?

36:26.918 --> 36:29.587
{\an5}Well, my album's gonna drop
first quarter next year.

36:26.918 --> 36:29.587
Okay.

36:29.654 --> 36:31.656
{\an1}And the album is amazing,
so I'm just looking forward

36:31.722 --> 36:33.224
{\an4}to everybody in here
listening to it.

36:31.722 --> 36:33.224
(Shanda) Off the chain.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.026
{\an5}And knowing exactly what it is.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.026
(cheering and applause)

36:35.092 --> 36:37.128
{\an5}(Nina)
Well, we know you can sing,
we know that, so we know that.

36:37.194 --> 36:38.963
{\an5}So, Shanda, let me ask you,
I know you cleared it up
a little bit,

36:39.030 --> 36:41.165
but are you retired now
from the dancing?

36:41.232 --> 36:43.034
I put my shoes up,
but you never know.

36:43.100 --> 36:44.502
{\an5}Nah, yeah, she retired.

36:43.100 --> 36:44.502
You never know.

36:44.569 --> 36:47.772
Yeah, she retired.

36:47.838 --> 36:49.407
All right, we gotta take
a break, but coming up,

36:49.473 --> 36:51.976
we're reliving all of
the moments we'll never forget

36:52.043 --> 36:54.011
and some we wish we could.

36:54.078 --> 36:57.181
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood The
Reunion" is coming right back.

36:57.248 --> 36:59.183
(cheering and applause)

37:02.119 --> 37:03.988
{\an8}Don't let fame change you.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.290
{\an8}I did want to let everyone
know that I do have a new...

37:06.357 --> 37:08.659
{\an8}(all oohing)

37:15.700 --> 37:18.502
(cheering and applause)

37:18.569 --> 37:21.939
{\an8}Welcome back to part two
of "Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood
The Reunion."

37:22.006 --> 37:24.575
{\an8}Now, we've rounded up
the most memorable moments

37:24.642 --> 37:26.544
from the season
and I have to say,

37:26.611 --> 37:28.145
it makes a pretty good case

37:28.212 --> 37:30.481
for the West Coast
being the best coast.

37:30.548 --> 37:32.750
{\an5}Take a look.

37:30.548 --> 37:32.750
(cheering and applause)

37:32.817 --> 37:34.352
{\an8}You got grills?

37:34.418 --> 37:36.320
{\an8}Let me see.

37:34.418 --> 37:36.320
{\an8}'Cause I'm a thug.

37:36.387 --> 37:37.455
{\an8}No, you not.

37:37.521 --> 37:39.490
{\an8}You are a very
hardworking man.

37:39.557 --> 37:42.526
{\an8}Sometimes I have a weird way
of showing my appreciation.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.028
{\an8}Wait, is this my wife?

37:44.095 --> 37:46.664
{\an8}Look how that thing sitting up
on that diamond-- Oh, my God.

37:46.731 --> 37:48.132
{\an7}Rubies.

37:48.199 --> 37:49.533
{\an7}Rubis!

37:49.600 --> 37:52.069
{\an7}Can I just call you 40?
Since--

37:49.600 --> 37:52.069
{\an6}Absolutely.

37:52.136 --> 37:53.270
{\an8}For round off.

37:52.136 --> 37:53.270
{\an8}Knock yourself out.

37:53.337 --> 37:55.039
{\an7}And we might as well
call her 30.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.675
{\an8}So you're technically 50.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.675
{\an7}What?

37:57.742 --> 37:59.377
{\an9}I love you.

37:57.742 --> 37:59.377
{\an8}Love you more.

37:59.443 --> 38:01.178
{\an8}So that means
you're gonna be calling me

38:01.245 --> 38:02.980
{\an8}to show me how much
you love me more.

38:03.047 --> 38:06.517
{\an8}Right? Right?

38:06.584 --> 38:09.620
{\an9}Right?

38:09.687 --> 38:11.255
{\an9}Come on.

38:09.687 --> 38:11.255
{\an8}Let's get it.

38:11.322 --> 38:13.624
{\an8}Appreciate you.

38:11.322 --> 38:13.624
{\an8}Yeah! Wait, let me get in that.

38:13.691 --> 38:16.193
{\an8}No, no, you don't get in that.

38:13.691 --> 38:16.193
{\an8}I'm adding plaques to the wall.

38:16.260 --> 38:18.729
{\an8}I want the shoots,
the print ad,

38:18.796 --> 38:21.465
{\an8}the monsters,
Times Square.

38:21.532 --> 38:25.002
{\an8}Look, Nick, tell Blue
I'm new on the roster.

38:21.532 --> 38:25.002
{\an5}Oh, my God, she's still going.

38:31.809 --> 38:33.477
(Nina)
Ray, what's up with Brandi?

38:33.544 --> 38:36.047
It feels like you guys
just kind of let her talk,

38:36.113 --> 38:37.715
but I feel like
she gets tuned out a lot.

38:37.782 --> 38:40.151
{\an7}Yeah, that's my--
that's my little relative, man.

38:40.217 --> 38:42.253
Like, on this show, you can
really see who she really is

38:42.319 --> 38:45.022
{\an1}and she's fun, like, a lot
of girls can relate to that.

38:45.089 --> 38:47.892
{\an5}Okay, all right.

38:45.089 --> 38:47.892
I mean, some, I mean...

38:47.958 --> 38:49.827
All right,
we have to wrap up,

38:49.894 --> 38:53.264
but do any of you
have any final words?

38:53.330 --> 38:55.066
{\an8}Well, yeah, I did want
to let everyone know

38:55.132 --> 38:57.601
{\an8}that I do have a new love.

38:57.668 --> 39:01.372
{\an5}I don't know if I'm gonna
say a man, but, yeah,
I do have a new boo.

39:01.439 --> 39:02.773
{\an5}Okay.

39:01.439 --> 39:02.773
Yeah.

39:02.840 --> 39:05.509
(cheering and applause)

39:05.576 --> 39:07.278
Fizz,
any final words for you?

39:07.344 --> 39:09.413
{\an8}I mean,
I appreciate everybody,

39:09.480 --> 39:11.582
{\an8}you know, sharing
their stories this season.

39:11.649 --> 39:14.585
{\an8}I know it takes a lot to get out
there in front of these cameras

39:14.652 --> 39:16.721
and do what we doing,
thank you.

39:16.787 --> 39:18.089
{\an5}All right.

39:16.787 --> 39:18.089
Thank you for people at home.

39:18.155 --> 39:20.424
{\an8}Rich, anything from you?

39:18.155 --> 39:20.424
{\an8}I agree with my man Fizz.

39:20.491 --> 39:22.927
{\an8}But you can catch me next week

39:22.993 --> 39:25.262

39:29.100 --> 39:30.468
Miles.

39:30.534 --> 39:32.269
{\an8}Don't let fame change you.

39:32.336 --> 39:34.438
(Nina)
All right, now.

39:34.505 --> 39:38.542
{\an8}Milan?

39:34.505 --> 39:38.542
{\an8}I just want everybody to be
them, be you, love yourself.

39:38.609 --> 39:40.711
{\an8}That's it.

39:40.778 --> 39:42.613
{\an8}Moniece?

39:42.680 --> 39:44.682
{\an8}Any final words?

39:44.749 --> 39:46.450
I'll take that as a no.

39:46.517 --> 39:47.852
Hope you're having
a good night.

39:47.918 --> 39:50.287
All right, now,
it is time to yell "cut"

39:50.354 --> 39:52.590
