In the criminal justice system

00:02.903 --> 00:06.483
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:06.874 --> 00:08.584
the police
who investigate crime

00:08.742 --> 00:11.312
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:11.512 --> 00:12.582

So this mugger
doesn't find any money.

00:18.485 --> 00:21.255
He says to the lady,
"Where is it, in your girdle?"

00:22.289 --> 00:23.929
Sister, you're not listening.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.374
It's almost 8:00. The

00:28.595 --> 00:31.235
I wish these people would at
least pick up after themselves.

00:31.832 --> 00:34.782
Anyway, he feels
all around her girdle.

00:35.002 --> 00:39.472
Again he says, "Where's the money?"
And the lady says, "Keep looking.

Every morning we clean up
after these junkies.

00:58.592 --> 01:01.232
We always gave them food. Maybe
it wasn't such a good idea.

Was this girl a regular
in your soup line?

01:03.196 --> 01:04.266
I don't think so.

he was partying here last night.

Good morning,
Mr. Sariego.

01:21.848 --> 01:24.588
So, is this
one of your party pals?

01:25.686 --> 01:28.166
No. I never
seen her before.

01:29.222 --> 01:32.292
And anyway, I like a little
meat on my girls, you know?

01:33.093 --> 01:35.513
What time did the
festivities end last night?

01:36.463 --> 01:38.813
I don't know.
I booked around 3:00.

01:38.865 --> 01:42.365
I didn't wanna be around here with these nuns.
They know karate.

out the thermals last night.

She's a junkie, Mike. She
probably thought it was July.

So she gets out of the heat and
lies down here to get comfortable?

Seen her maybe a couple of times
since we busted up three months ago.

We were going pretty hot, then
she went crazy with the junk.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.721

05:49.783 --> 05:51.923
Yeah, right,
because you're high on life.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.255
So I light up a bowl
on the weekends, big deal.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.391
She was fixing up maybe
four or five times a day.

05:56.990 --> 06:00.700
Well, in between getting stoned,
did she ever mention her family?

06:00.927 --> 06:03.067
No. Wasn't
a big item with her.

06:03.463 --> 06:05.703
The only one she ever talked
about was her kid brother, Matt.

06:05.765 --> 06:07.935
Did she ever say
where her family lived?

06:08.101 --> 06:10.271
She might've said something.
I wasn't paying attention.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.350
Sounds like you two
were made for each other.

06:12.505 --> 06:14.135
Hey, if I wasn't
hooked up with somebody else,

06:14.207 --> 06:15.847
maybe I'd have given
Katie another chance.

06:15.909 --> 06:19.019
I heard she was trying rehab.
Some place near Thompson Park.

06:23.116 --> 06:25.486
HERBERT: Katie shot a lot of heroin
into that blue blood of hers.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.692
You know, she was Ken Blanchard's daughter.
He ran for the Senate.

06:29.356 --> 06:32.496
Yeah, I remember him. Died in
a car crash a few years back.

06:32.559 --> 06:33.629
Yeah. He was DWI.

06:34.427 --> 06:36.667
Listen, no offense or anything,

06:36.730 --> 06:40.110
but shouldn't his daughter have been at
some four-star rehab in Connecticut?

06:40.166 --> 06:41.906
Katie was cut off
from her family.

06:42.869 --> 06:46.579
You know, this may not be the Queen Mary
of rehab, but it's not the Titanic either.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.850
We provide the basics.
Methadone and therapy.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.619
Well, it doesn't sound
like it was enough.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.177
HERBERT: Well,
if you give it a chance.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.915
Katie was with the program
for about two months.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.123
Then about a month ago,
she walked away.

06:58.184 --> 06:59.464
Any idea why?

06:59.753 --> 07:03.033
Look, I got the feeling that rehab was
something she did to con her family.

07:03.490 --> 07:06.130
She'd stay clean for a week,
then disappear for a few days.

07:06.393 --> 07:08.203
Another week here
and then the same thing.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.005
So where does her family live?

07:11.665 --> 07:12.835
I'll get the address.

07:14.467 --> 07:15.777
She was found where?

07:16.937 --> 07:19.177
In a playground
on the Lower East Side.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.049
She died outside?

07:23.610 --> 07:25.060
I thought she was in rehab.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.619
Oh, well, the people there
told us she left a month ago.

07:29.316 --> 07:32.086
Oh, I'm not surprised.

07:33.153 --> 07:36.363
Every place I sent her, she'd stay
long enough to pass a blood test,

07:37.657 --> 07:41.727
then she'd ask me for money.
It all went to drugs.

07:43.029 --> 07:45.069
Finally, I had to say,
"No more."

07:46.466 --> 07:47.946
Did she come here?

07:48.001 --> 07:50.111
She knew better.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.351
My youngest, Carlie,
is still in high school.

07:53.873 --> 07:56.253
I refused to let her see
her sister like that.

08:00.580 --> 08:03.580
I know a mother shouldn't say
this, but Katie was my favorite.

08:04.317 --> 08:07.227
She was so beautiful.
She could've...

08:11.958 --> 08:13.368
She was also the most trouble.

08:15.895 --> 08:18.925
We're trying to determine who she
might've been with when she died.

08:19.265 --> 08:21.745
Were there any other relatives
she might've been in touch with?

08:21.801 --> 08:22.971
We heard she had a brother.

08:24.838 --> 08:28.408
Matthew. He was at Yale Law.
Second year.

08:29.876 --> 08:31.906
Maybe you should
speak to Jerome Kamen.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.148
A friend of your daughter's?

08:33.212 --> 08:34.693
Our business adviser.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.990
He was at college
with my husband, Ken.

08:40.953 --> 08:44.734
Ever since he died, Jerry's been
like a father to my children.

08:50.163 --> 08:53.273
Any arrangements that need
to be made, you talk to me.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.083
Actually, we're wondering if
you talked to Katie recently?

08:56.569 --> 08:59.709
On the phone, briefly, and
she stopped by a few times.

09:01.007 --> 09:02.417
You know where she was staying?

09:02.475 --> 09:03.845
At a rehab center.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.745
BRISCOE: Well, not for the last month.
We talked to them.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.151
She told me she was doing fine.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.156
What did she come
to see you about?

09:12.519 --> 09:15.229
Money. Her mother
had cut her off.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.032
She told me
not to give Katie a dime.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.371
Tough love.

09:19.759 --> 09:24.169
Yeah. To put it mildly. With
Meryl, it's her way or no way.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.408
But I've known the children
since they were babies.

09:27.934 --> 09:30.184
I thought about what their
father would've wanted me to do.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.110
So I gave Katie a few dollars.

09:32.939 --> 09:35.779
All she had to live on were
her social security checks.

09:36.042 --> 09:37.652
Well, she didn't look 65.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.954
The federal government considers
addiction a disability.

09:41.781 --> 09:43.321
They send her checks
twice a month.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.293
Even though
the family's worth millions?

09:46.553 --> 09:48.293
That money is held in trust.

09:49.889 --> 09:51.529
She had to survive somehow.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.398
Nice lady,
this Mrs. Blanchard.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.171
She was hosting
cocktail parties

09:56.229 --> 09:58.229
while her daughter was
living on the dole.

09:58.398 --> 10:01.538
Right, she should've let the kid shoot
the family fortune into her arm.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.811
Oh, you'd throw your
daughter out on the street?

10:04.037 --> 10:06.777
My daughter could go through my
fortune in about a day and a half.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.950
Yeah, but what if you had
Blanchard's money?

10:09.409 --> 10:11.859
Hey, maybe if somebody had kicked
me out when I was drinking,

10:11.911 --> 10:14.121
I wouldn't have wasted
20 years inside a bottle.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.421
Hell of a gamble.

10:17.650 --> 10:21.190
Anyway, Kamen said she got
checks every two weeks, right?

10:21.755 --> 10:23.695
Social security must've known
where to send them.

10:24.724 --> 10:27.714
Under the Social Security Act
of 1972,

10:27.961 --> 10:30.641
addicts are entitled
to $750 a month.

10:30.697 --> 10:31.727
What?

10:31.798 --> 10:33.508
Somebody actually thinks
this is a good idea?

10:33.700 --> 10:35.410
You'd rather they mug you
for their money?

10:35.869 --> 10:38.079
Look, we don't simply
hand money to the addict.

10:38.138 --> 10:41.918
We send a check to a responsible
payee, usually a parent.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.882
The payee gives funds
to the recipient as needed.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.318
So who was
Katie Blanchard's payee?

10:54.020 --> 10:55.590
Herbert James Fowler.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.536
He runs the rehabilitation center
where Miss Blanchard was staying.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.232
That's where we
sent the checks.

11:01.728 --> 11:03.258
When was the last check cashed?

11:04.697 --> 11:07.177
Last week,
by Mr. Fowler.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.708
(ON SPEAKER) I told you, Katie
left the center four weeks ago.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.348
Well, according to Uncle Sam,

11:14.807 --> 11:16.807
you were still
cashing her checks.

11:17.277 --> 11:20.187
Mr. Fowler had the authority
to cash those checks.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.920
If she's there he does.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.589
Maybe she never
left the rehab, huh, Herb?

11:26.653 --> 11:27.833
Maybe she OD'd there.

11:27.887 --> 11:29.297
Look, that didn't happen.

11:31.658 --> 11:36.228
Look. She was a walking disaster.
She was never gonna get cured.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.896
Rehab was
a revolving door for her.

11:39.866 --> 11:43.006
I thought she'd come back sooner or later.
I was holding her money.

11:43.269 --> 11:46.979
Where? In a bank?
Or under your mattress?

11:48.241 --> 11:50.591
It's in the general
operating fund.

11:52.011 --> 11:54.821
Really? Okay.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.888
I'm sure the Feds can
help me track it down.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.591
We don't really have to
get them involved, do we?

12:01.087 --> 12:02.657
Why not?
If he's got nothing to hide.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.362
I swear to God,
she wasn't there.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.955
What's the problem then?

12:21.040 --> 12:23.850
She wasn't the only junkie
you were ripping off, was she?

12:26.913 --> 12:29.053
Okay. Look...

12:29.582 --> 12:31.762
If he's ready to admit
to fraud, you have to believe

12:31.818 --> 12:33.628
he's telling the truth
about not seeing her.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.826
If nothing else,
you uncovered his scam.

12:35.888 --> 12:38.658
Great. I'll tell Mrs. Blanchard
her daughter didn't die in vain.

12:38.725 --> 12:39.725
(BANGING ON DOOR)

12:40.426 --> 12:43.426
Lieutenant, I've got the autopsy
report on Kathleen Blanchard.

12:43.496 --> 12:44.496
Oh, thank you.

12:46.933 --> 12:51.813
Inconclusive for hypothermia. She died
of an overdose of high potency heroin.

12:51.871 --> 12:53.751
She must've had
some going-away party.

12:53.806 --> 12:55.576
The party was
catered in Chinatown.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.712
According to this, her last
supper was duck and hoisin sauce.

12:58.945 --> 13:02.445
Peking duck. Thirty bucks a pop.
Some taste, huh?

13:02.715 --> 13:04.345
Life wasn't all fun and games.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.958
The ME found some hemorrhaging
on the walls of her uterus.

13:08.321 --> 13:12.361
Meaning that she had an abortion or a
miscarriage in the past two weeks.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.798
Katie left four weeks ago.

13:17.096 --> 13:18.836
You marked it in your calendar?

13:18.898 --> 13:21.208
My second wedding anniversary.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.707
My husband, Raoul,
he's doing a bullet at Rikers.

13:23.936 --> 13:25.676
Anyway, I haven't
seen Katie since.

13:25.738 --> 13:28.838
Well, maybe she paid a visit during your lunch break.
You got a sign-in book?

13:28.908 --> 13:32.188
This look like Betty Ford?
People don't sign in.

13:32.612 --> 13:35.122
Even if she did come back,
it makes a difference?

13:35.181 --> 13:39.601
We figure she got pregnant here and maybe
one of your residents is the proud papa.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.002
And she might've
gotten in touch with him.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.404
One of these losers?

13:42.689 --> 13:46.359
She'd have to be pretty hard up. Besides,
Katie had some guy on the outside.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.799
She ever tell you his name?

13:48.995 --> 13:50.525
Some short name.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.341
Rick.
Erik?

13:54.567 --> 13:57.737
Could be. I figure
that's where she went.

13:58.104 --> 14:01.424
I mean, she took one of those home pregnancy tests.
The stick turned blue.

14:01.808 --> 14:04.118
She flipped out.
The next day, she split.

14:04.944 --> 14:07.124
Come on, man. How many times
we gotta go through this?

14:07.347 --> 14:08.827
Until you get it right.

14:09.148 --> 14:11.818
See, the way we hear it, when
Katie came back from rehab,

14:11.884 --> 14:15.764
she had a little surprise for you. You
were gonna get it in about nine months.

14:17.156 --> 14:19.326
No way. Not me.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.802
No way?
She came crying to you.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.341
What did she want?
Money for an abortion?

14:23.396 --> 14:24.636
I didn't knock her up.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.935
I haven't been with her
for three months.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.880
Look, why don't you guys just go take a
bribe or whatever it is you usually do?

14:32.739 --> 14:34.739
You know, you look like
you could use a few pounds.

14:34.907 --> 14:36.047
Why don't we go in the kitchen,

14:36.109 --> 14:38.249
see if there's any milk
and cookies in there, huh?

14:38.911 --> 14:41.221
Okay, Erik,
this is how it works.

14:41.547 --> 14:45.517
We're gonna check her ID.
If she is one day shy of 17,

14:45.618 --> 14:48.828
we toss this whole place, then maybe
we find a controlled substance.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.028
You want me to go on?
Not if you don't have to.

14:51.657 --> 14:52.657
UP '10 you.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.468
Katie gave me the whole song and dance.
She didn't even look pregnant.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.441
She wants me to pay to get rid of it.
I blew her off.

15:00.933 --> 15:02.573
The kid probably
wasn't even mine.

15:02.635 --> 15:03.905
And since then?

15:08.141 --> 15:11.521
All right, I wonder
what's in this box?

15:11.577 --> 15:12.647
All right. All right.

15:13.913 --> 15:17.223
She called about a week ago. She was
hurting real bad. She needed a score.

15:17.283 --> 15:18.523
And you're the man, right?

15:18.584 --> 15:19.894
I don't deal.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.690
I just know where to shop.
I brought it to her.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.785
Where?

15:23.856 --> 15:25.596
She was staying
up on West 81st.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.828
She didn't want me to come upstairs.
She was with some guy.

15:27.894 --> 15:31.364
So I met her on the corner on Broadway.
And that's the last time I saw her.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.267
(CAR HORN HONKING)

15:41.607 --> 15:42.747
You believe this?

15:43.576 --> 15:46.576
Used to be South Bronx,
Alphabet City...

15:46.813 --> 15:48.553
Now these junkies
have trust funds.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.654
Hey, 10 years ago they were
tooting coke through $100 bills.

15:51.717 --> 15:53.747
Maybe they've heard needles
are chic this year.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.827
Which side of the street
you want?

15:55.888 --> 15:57.458
Maybe there's a faster way.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.763
She had Peking duck
before she died.

16:00.893 --> 16:05.313
Okay, chicken and cashew nut,
sweet sour pork. It's $10.95.

16:05.565 --> 16:06.935
About 30 minutes.

16:07.867 --> 16:11.437
Come on, Mr. Woo, three days ago?
She ordered Peking duck?

16:11.737 --> 16:16.147
Same like everybody. It's the house special.
A hundred phone order every day.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.879
Main room always busy.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.317
(PHONE RINGING)

16:21.481 --> 16:22.861
I never see her here.

16:23.349 --> 16:26.689
Maybe the duck went to her. You got
delivery tickets from three days ago?

16:26.886 --> 16:27.886
Hold on.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.094

Yeah. I got an order for you.

16:32.124 --> 16:35.234
Yes. Hey,
lunch special, $4.95.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.505
Here it is. I'm sure
you have the wrong building.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.877
I'm sure we don't.
Who lives here?

16:43.936 --> 16:45.306
The Cassinis did.

16:45.371 --> 16:48.911
They cashed in city life for Tuscany.
It's been on the market for two months.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.745
Are you sure you have
the right unit number?

16:51.811 --> 16:54.621
K-T, 14-C. Peking duck.

16:54.914 --> 16:57.904
As clean as a whistle, right
down to the empty waste baskets.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.994
Why? What were you
expecting to find?

17:00.052 --> 17:01.402
How about this girl?

17:01.787 --> 17:03.427
Have you ever
seen her here before?

17:03.489 --> 17:04.699
Yes.

17:05.324 --> 17:08.743
She's Mr. Cassini's niece. She's
been staying here the last month.

17:09.829 --> 17:10.829
Staying here alone?

17:10.896 --> 17:12.097
Well, yes.

17:13.432 --> 17:17.182
Why, what's... She's not the one who...
Oh, dear God.

17:18.304 --> 17:20.344
Who told you
she was their niece?

17:20.406 --> 17:22.546
Their business manager,
Mr. Kamen.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.112
Jerome Kamen?

17:24.242 --> 17:26.353
She's been staying here
with his permission.

17:28.180 --> 17:31.860
Understand my situation. It
was the Cassini's apartment.

17:32.318 --> 17:35.418
If they found out...
Well, you can imagine.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.131
Right now my imagination's
working overtime.

17:38.524 --> 17:39.534
I'm sure it is.

17:40.326 --> 17:43.266
Katie came to me.
She said she was pregnant.

17:44.530 --> 17:46.810
She didn't want to give birth
to a drug-addicted baby.

17:47.066 --> 17:50.336
I gave her some money and
told her to go to a clinic.

17:50.636 --> 17:54.306
And the keys to the Cassini place, you
just throw those in to cheer her up?

17:54.373 --> 17:57.223
She wouldn't go back to rehab. Her
mother didn't want her in the house.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.623
I wasn't gonna let her
sleep on the street.

18:00.479 --> 18:02.479
Well, that's
all very commendable,

18:02.682 --> 18:05.792
except for the lies and the
clean-up job at the apartment.

18:06.752 --> 18:10.962
All I did was pack up her things
after I found out she was dead.

18:11.157 --> 18:12.637
I have her suitcase right here.

18:12.892 --> 18:16.002
As far as we're concerned, that
apartment is the scene of the crime.

18:16.162 --> 18:18.772
So, you don't mind if we conduct
a little search there, do you?

18:18.998 --> 18:23.738
I have nothing to hide. I was just doing
what I thought was best for Katie.

18:24.637 --> 18:28.017
Somebody forgot to tell this girl
disability money's for food.

18:28.241 --> 18:33.121
Gold necklace. Louis Vuitton
wallet including six $100 bills.

18:33.913 --> 18:37.593
None of which sticks around if she was
partying with her junkie friends.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.353
You know, CSU went through all
of this stuff and the apartment.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.203
Kamen's prints
are on everything.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.925
Well, he packed her suitcase and
he was showing the apartment.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.941
Which means he opens the door
and says "Look around."

18:46.993 --> 18:49.843
But his prints were in the bathroom,
they were all over the furniture.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.596
Look, he shacks her up in this
place and then he lies about it.

18:52.865 --> 18:55.235
I, for one, don't believe
in his Father Flanagan act.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.478
I, for one, am jealous.

18:58.004 --> 19:01.424
Divorced, middle-aged guy,
young single girl...

19:01.474 --> 19:03.824
None of which ties him to her death.
Yeah.

19:03.876 --> 19:08.116
But say Kamen gets an itch. He pops
over on Katie but Katie's OD'd.

19:08.214 --> 19:10.494
If he was afraid of her
being found there alive,

19:10.549 --> 19:12.359
now he's got a real problem.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.088
He owns a car.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.220
Maybe he took her out
through the garage.

19:16.522 --> 19:19.262
Well, even if she left
anything behind in the car,

19:19.325 --> 19:21.695
we don't have enough
for a warrant to search it.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.803
Arrest him for hindering.

19:25.865 --> 19:28.465
Still doesn't get us
a search warrant.

in his car.

of the car, Mr. Kamen?

No. You mind telling me
what this is all about?

20:01.434 --> 20:03.684
You're under arrest
for hindering prosecution.

20:03.736 --> 20:06.266

Yeah. It's all a big joke.

inventoried for your protection.

on up the food chain.

think he's up for a game of Scrabble.

have to settle for hindering.

20:45.911 --> 20:50.381
That was Logan. The labs came back.
They found her vomit in his car,

20:50.449 --> 20:52.989
trace amounts of blood
matched her blood type.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.762
Which means she was still alive when
he took her out of the apartment.

20:55.821 --> 21:00.071
And he let her die in a playground instead
of taking her to an emergency room.

21:00.159 --> 21:03.329
Sure. No doctors, no police,
no embarrassing questions.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.436
We don't know
what his intent was.

to the hospital when she died.

with man one.

got there without her.

you say my client did.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.456
He was having an affair
with a client's daughter.

22:35.521 --> 22:38.931
He was afraid of being compromised.
She overdosed. He panicked.

22:38.991 --> 22:41.601
That's insane! I kept that
girl out of the gutter...

22:41.660 --> 22:42.660
Jerry!

22:43.696 --> 22:45.606
And no doubt you have
evidence of this affair.

22:45.664 --> 22:46.734
We'll find the evidence.

22:46.799 --> 22:50.009
He stepped in it up to his shorts,
I'm sure he left footprints.

22:50.069 --> 22:52.639
So this vomit, that's about the
extent of your case, is that right?

22:53.372 --> 22:54.912
Well, then I have
bad news for you.

22:56.108 --> 22:58.648
Omnibus motion to suppress
the evidence from the car

22:59.111 --> 23:02.521
and to dismiss the charges.
Jerry, let's go.

23:08.320 --> 23:11.630
The police knew that they had no grounds
for a warrant to search his car.

23:11.924 --> 23:14.844
So they decided to wait until
they could ambush him in his car

23:14.894 --> 23:17.814
and they could conduct what they
called this "inventory-search."

23:17.897 --> 23:19.597
It's laughable, Your Honor.

23:19.932 --> 23:21.342
Not to the Court of Appeals.

23:22.034 --> 23:24.984
People v. Galak. The need
to conduct an inventory

23:25.037 --> 23:28.017
of a prisoner's personal effects
provides its own rationale

23:28.073 --> 23:29.183
for searching those effects.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.191
POLLARD: Well, they vacuumed
the carpet, Your Honor.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.693
What were they doing
an inventory of? Dust mites?

23:34.647 --> 23:37.087
And the officers had the
arrest warrant for 16 hours

23:37.149 --> 23:38.919
before they decided to
pick up my client.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.728
How about it, Mr. McCoy?
Why the delay?

23:42.321 --> 23:46.601
A defendant has no constitutional or
statutory right to a speedy arrest.

23:47.526 --> 23:49.296
I can cite People v. Bryant
on that one.

23:49.728 --> 23:52.068
A trial term opinion? Please.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.601
Even Mr. Magoo
could see right through this.

23:55.067 --> 23:57.477
Motion to suppress is granted.
Thank you, Your Honor.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.677
And since the evidence
taken from the car

23:59.738 --> 24:01.578
is the sole foundation
for the manslaughter charge...

24:01.640 --> 24:04.120
Got it. The motion to
dismiss is also granted.

24:04.777 --> 24:08.917
Mr. McCoy, the next time your police
officers try to sneak one past this court,

24:08.981 --> 24:10.461
I'm gonna cite them
for contempt.

24:12.851 --> 24:15.831
There's no excuse, lieutenant.
It was a lousy search.

24:17.122 --> 24:20.162
And you tell your detectives that
the Bill of Rights isn't a doormat.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.572
It was my call.

24:21.727 --> 24:25.397
Judge Rodriguez gets
birthday cards from the ACLU.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.504
Any other judge
would've allowed the search.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.980
Oh, really?
In your opinion.

24:29.768 --> 24:31.678
You arrest a man like
Jerome Kamen,

24:31.837 --> 24:35.407
you make damn sure that your
ducks are standing beak to tail.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.894
But if it's somebody uptown, we have
your permission to cut corners?

24:39.144 --> 24:40.684
I'll keep that in mind.

24:45.050 --> 24:46.890
A man in Kamen's position,

24:48.654 --> 24:52.434
why would he risk compromising himself
with this girl? It doesn't make sense.

24:52.725 --> 24:54.495
He put her up
in a client's apartment.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.200
ADAM: Yeah.
An act of kindness.

24:56.729 --> 24:58.439
Hardly grounds to indict.

24:58.664 --> 25:01.984
I don't think his conscience was clear
when he left her behind a dumpster.

25:04.470 --> 25:05.540
He's hiding something.

25:05.604 --> 25:06.784
Then bring me somebody.

25:06.839 --> 25:10.049
Anybody who'll testify he was
having an affair with this girl.

25:10.109 --> 25:12.279
Apparently she was
still close to her brother.

25:13.545 --> 25:14.575
Okay.

25:15.614 --> 25:19.824
Mr. Kamen used to bounce us on his knee.
He's been like a father to us.

25:19.885 --> 25:23.025
I can't imagine he would
take advantage of Katie.

25:23.255 --> 25:25.125
Well, we found evidence
she was in his car.

25:25.190 --> 25:28.330
Yeah. But the judge threw that out, right?
So that doesn't prove anything.

25:28.727 --> 25:31.107
You're second year law? You
should know better than that.

25:31.263 --> 25:32.673
I know Jerome Kamen.

25:34.166 --> 25:35.266
(SIGHS)

25:35.334 --> 25:38.874
After my dad died, my mother
and he became very close.

25:38.937 --> 25:43.547
I thought it was leading somewhere.
But Jerry was too loyal to my father.

25:43.942 --> 25:44.942
He backed off.

25:45.511 --> 25:47.721
Did you talk to your sister
in the weeks before she died?

25:48.347 --> 25:51.517
Yes. She would call once a
week to make sure I was okay.

25:52.151 --> 25:56.831
She thought I was some sort of role model
because I escaped the family curse.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.126
How do you mean?

26:00.326 --> 26:04.396
We come from a whole line of alcoholics
who think they're social drinkers.

26:04.463 --> 26:05.943
Dad. Mom.

26:07.266 --> 26:11.366
Well, maybe if Katie'd stuck to alcohol,
she might've remained part of the family.

26:11.904 --> 26:15.044
Was there anyone else she might've
confided in, any friends?

26:15.207 --> 26:18.207
Friends? You mean like people
she shared a needle with?

26:18.277 --> 26:21.087
Well, her boyfriend told the police
you might've met some of them.

26:21.146 --> 26:23.746
The last time I saw her,
she drove up to Yale

26:23.816 --> 26:26.346
with an actress, Teena Varga.

26:26.852 --> 26:29.462
She'd been an extra
in some Spike Lee movie.

26:30.622 --> 26:33.102
I just got back in town
a couple days ago.

26:34.159 --> 26:36.569
You sure you're talking
about Katie Blanchard?

26:37.563 --> 26:40.673
It's her. You didn't
even know she overdosed?

26:41.667 --> 26:44.877
I been on a set in the middle of
the Nevada Desert for a week.

26:45.471 --> 26:48.541
It's not like I got The Post
delivered every morning.

26:50.509 --> 26:51.509
Who was with her?

26:52.911 --> 26:54.721
What makes you think
anyone was?

26:54.780 --> 26:56.820
She was a total klutz
with needles.

26:57.382 --> 27:01.992
She never got the hang of it. She
always needed somebody to fix her up.

27:02.921 --> 27:04.761
You have any idea
who that might've been?

27:04.823 --> 27:06.063
Well, it wasn't me.

27:06.558 --> 27:09.438
All somebody had to do
was take her to a hospital.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.812
I'm sure she would've
been okay.

27:13.132 --> 27:16.382
After she left the rehab,
she was staying on West 81st.

27:16.735 --> 27:20.765
Yeah. A nice place.
A real change of pace for her.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.980
She never had money before.

27:23.041 --> 27:24.491
But all of a sudden she did?

27:24.543 --> 27:25.993
No. I mean
she didn't steal it.

27:27.045 --> 27:28.915
She told me
she had a rich uncle.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.328
Would that be Jerome Kamen?

27:31.383 --> 27:32.423
Could be.

27:32.785 --> 27:34.385
She used to call him Jerry.

27:35.554 --> 27:38.504
She used to go by his office every
couple of days for a refill.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.597
Two or three grand each time.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.097
What did you think
was going on between them?

27:43.595 --> 27:45.225
She didn't want to
talk about it.

27:45.964 --> 27:49.414
But it's not what you think.
That she would've told me.

27:51.036 --> 27:54.376
According to her friends, Katie
bought enough heroin in four weeks

27:54.440 --> 27:55.940
to tranquilize
a herd of elephants.

27:56.742 --> 28:00.692
Must have been a popular girl.
Kamen was paying for it?

28:01.080 --> 28:04.190
He gave her something like
$40,000 during the last month.

28:04.283 --> 28:06.823
Her friend doesn't think it was
because they were having an affair.

28:06.885 --> 28:08.585
Didn't he cry poverty
at his arraignment?

28:08.654 --> 28:11.004
He said he was in hock
to his ex-wife.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.761
If she has
a good divorce attorney,

28:13.825 --> 28:16.095
I'm sure Kamen has to account
for every penny he makes.

28:16.161 --> 28:19.511
Unless he has a source of income he
doesn't want anyone to know about.

28:20.232 --> 28:24.372
Talk to his secretary, see if he keeps
a printing press in his basement.

28:27.573 --> 28:30.553
Can we make this quick? If Mr. Kamen
finds out I'm meeting with you...

28:30.642 --> 28:32.382
I didn't twist your arm,
Ms. Oster.

28:32.911 --> 28:35.651
But if I don't talk to you, it
looks like I'm hiding something.

28:36.115 --> 28:38.815
Then you get to do a number on me
like you're doing on Mr. Kamen.

28:39.151 --> 28:40.631
You think we're being
unfair to him?

28:41.120 --> 28:43.900
The man knocks himself out for
people like the Blanchards.

28:44.289 --> 28:46.999
The way they treat him,
"Fetch this, fetch that,"

28:47.526 --> 28:49.766
"clean up this mess,
clean up that one."

28:50.796 --> 28:52.636
Katie Blanchard being
one of those messes?

28:52.898 --> 28:54.208
The three years
I've been with him,

28:54.266 --> 28:57.796
there hasn't been a month he hasn't had to
pull her out of one hell hole or another.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.020
Her family just
throws money at the problem.

29:00.505 --> 29:02.135
Or they let
Mr. Kamen do it.

29:03.442 --> 29:07.392
Ms. Oster, we know that she picked up an
envelope from his office every few days.

29:10.816 --> 29:14.226
She came in about a month ago.
The little brat threw a fit.

29:14.520 --> 29:15.560
What about?

29:15.621 --> 29:18.101
What else? Her mommy
wasn't paying for her drugs.

29:19.291 --> 29:22.801
I could hear her in Mr. Kamen's office,
both faucets running full tilt,

29:22.861 --> 29:27.111
yelling about her trust fund. She practically
accused him of stealing from her.

29:28.033 --> 29:29.543
I guess that little act worked.

29:29.968 --> 29:31.408
Mr. Kamen started
giving her money?

29:31.470 --> 29:32.610
Wouldn't you,

29:33.105 --> 29:35.975
with some crazed junkie jumping
up and down on your desk?

29:42.547 --> 29:45.817
The trust was set up by the late
Mr. Blanchard for his three children.

29:45.884 --> 29:48.424
Discretionary authority
rests with Mr. Kamen.

29:48.687 --> 29:50.887
He's the only one authorized
to make withdrawals?

29:51.023 --> 29:54.103
Yes, for the children's health,
education and welfare.

29:54.626 --> 29:57.366
A month ago,
Miss Blanchard came in

29:57.429 --> 30:00.039
with a withdrawal slip
signed by Mr. Kamen.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.639
So you gave her her money?

30:02.701 --> 30:03.741
No.

30:04.436 --> 30:07.206
Mr. Kamen's signature
had been duplicated.

30:08.507 --> 30:09.607
You mean forged.

30:09.675 --> 30:12.115
I'm sure no crime was intended.

30:12.477 --> 30:15.547
Are you positive
it was duplicated?

30:15.614 --> 30:16.794
You checked the signature card?

30:16.848 --> 30:18.018
I didn't have to.

30:18.350 --> 30:21.990
I explained to Miss Blanchard, Mr. Kamen
has been coming into the bank every week

30:22.054 --> 30:24.934
for the past year to withdraw
funds from the children's trust.

30:25.190 --> 30:26.460
I know his signature.

30:27.192 --> 30:29.372
Miss Blanchard became livid.

30:29.428 --> 30:30.768
Because you caught her lying?

30:30.963 --> 30:32.173
Not entirely.

30:32.664 --> 30:36.084
She ranted that Mr. Kamen had
been taking money from the trust

30:36.134 --> 30:38.554
and none of it
was going to her.

30:39.805 --> 30:43.115
Well, I talked to her mother. She had
no idea Kamen was taking money out.

30:43.875 --> 30:48.115
He embezzled almost $350,000 from
the trust account in the past year.

30:48.380 --> 30:51.190
Assuming that he didn't use the
money for the Blanchard kids.

30:51.717 --> 30:54.247
We verified he bought Matthew
a car and a trip to Vail.

30:54.319 --> 30:56.229
Other than that, the
money's unaccounted for.

30:56.388 --> 30:57.798
It seems pretty clear cut.

30:59.825 --> 31:02.735
He got reamed in his divorce.
He was desperate for money.

31:03.195 --> 31:05.535
The Blanchard trust fund
was just too much temptation.

31:05.831 --> 31:07.641
And the girl suspected
what he was doing.

31:07.733 --> 31:11.043
She was the only one who ever complained
about his handling of the account.

31:11.570 --> 31:15.540
She read him the riot act and then from one
day to the next, she's rolling in money.

31:16.174 --> 31:17.454
Blackmailing him.

31:17.509 --> 31:18.779
It's a good reason to kill her.

31:18.844 --> 31:21.524
No. Don't jump the canyon
on your motorcycle.

31:22.447 --> 31:25.427
Motive is not an element
in proving a murder charge.

31:26.151 --> 31:28.221
We could start by
charging him with larceny.

31:29.121 --> 31:32.531
That gives us license to tear his life apart.
Maybe something shakes loose.

31:36.294 --> 31:37.304
Just a minute.

31:39.865 --> 31:41.165
Excuse me, I'm in a meeting.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.543
Not anymore.

31:42.768 --> 31:44.578
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

31:44.636 --> 31:46.376
This time,
the signature's still wet.

31:46.438 --> 31:48.778
Jerome Kamen, you're under
arrest for larceny.

31:49.174 --> 31:50.784
You have the right
to remain silent.

31:51.043 --> 31:53.183
Anything you do say can and
will be used against you in...

31:54.646 --> 31:56.516
I don't know, McCoy,
you must be working off some

31:56.581 --> 31:58.031
secret edition
of the penal code.

31:58.083 --> 32:02.793
The one I have says that larceny requires
intent to deprive another of property.

32:03.455 --> 32:06.155
Over 300 grand disappeared
into his pocket.

32:06.224 --> 32:08.864
What was he doing, buying
condos for the Blanchard kids?

32:08.960 --> 32:11.530
Have you even read
the trust document, Mr. McCoy?

32:12.230 --> 32:15.680
It gives me absolute discretion
to use those funds as I see fit.

32:15.734 --> 32:17.374
Except to line your own pocket.

32:17.436 --> 32:20.246
We got your financial records
from your ex-wife's attorney.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.479
Seems to us you've been
living beyond your means.

32:22.541 --> 32:24.751
Every dollar I withdrew
went to Katie.

32:24.810 --> 32:27.150
You have no idea
what I did for that girl.

32:27.212 --> 32:29.822
You let her blow
$300,000 on drugs.

32:30.482 --> 32:34.092
What category does that fall under,
her health, education, or welfare?

32:34.152 --> 32:38.192
You can't prove that that money
didn't go to Kathleen Blanchard.

32:38.256 --> 32:40.236
Ergo, your case is crap.

32:40.992 --> 32:43.872
Now you can rain down as many search
warrants as you want on my client,

32:43.929 --> 32:46.029
but it's not gonna jump start
any murder charge.

32:47.999 --> 32:50.949
We've searched his home,
his office. Nothing.

32:51.369 --> 32:53.779
We need a direct link
between Kamen

32:53.839 --> 32:56.909
and the girl's death, or we
can forget the whole thing.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.715
JACK: She was a junkie.
He gave her money.

32:58.777 --> 33:01.157
It's inevitable he knew what
she was going to do with it.

33:02.113 --> 33:06.063
We can argue that he kept her supplied
with drugs and is liable for her overdose.

33:06.284 --> 33:09.394
The appellate division doesn't see it that way.
People v. Pinckney.

33:09.454 --> 33:10.934
There's no criminal liability.

33:10.989 --> 33:15.059
That was also true in New Jersey until
last summer. State v. Maldanado.

33:15.594 --> 33:19.064
They expanded their strict liability
statute to include drug suppliers.

33:19.131 --> 33:23.201
New Jersey. They had a statute
to work from and we don't.

33:23.435 --> 33:27.245
It's already manslaughter if you inject
someone with drugs and they overdose.

33:27.339 --> 33:30.649
It's not a stretch to step it
back to include suppliers.

33:31.576 --> 33:34.056
Pinckney's a 20-year-old decision.
It doesn't scare me.

33:34.112 --> 33:35.182
Scares me.

33:36.148 --> 33:39.028
Did you say that this girl
needed help injecting herself?

33:39.484 --> 33:40.594
According to her friend.

33:41.620 --> 33:45.260
And could that helping hand
have come from Kamen?

33:45.657 --> 33:48.897
If we find out who sold her drugs that
night, it may take us back to Kamen.

33:49.161 --> 33:52.441
We know of one of her drug connections.
Her old boyfriend.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.881
Have him picked up. And get a
search warrant for his apartment.

33:58.403 --> 34:00.043
You guys got
cement in your ears?

34:00.405 --> 34:03.575
I didn't see Katie that night
for pleasure or business.

34:03.642 --> 34:06.712
Even as we speak, the police
are tearing your place apart.

34:07.078 --> 34:09.487
They turn up so much
as a molecule of heroin...

34:09.547 --> 34:14.188
Misdemeanor possession. So he was
a bad boy, so he pays a fine.

34:14.286 --> 34:17.786
Your client already admitted to the
police he sold heroin to Katie Blanchard

34:17.856 --> 34:19.426
a week before she died.

34:19.658 --> 34:23.368
The charge will read, "Possession
with intent to sell."

34:23.527 --> 34:25.797
That's a B felony.
Wait a second.

34:26.297 --> 34:29.108
I told you I gave it to her.
I didn't sell it.

34:29.167 --> 34:32.007
No. No, that's
not the way I heard it.

34:32.670 --> 34:35.951
One way or another, we'll prove you supplied
her with the heroin that killed her.

34:36.007 --> 34:37.746
That's getting close
to manslaughter.

34:44.549 --> 34:48.359
It's not manslaughter if my
client indirectly supplied her.

34:49.688 --> 34:50.757
Indirectly?

34:52.190 --> 34:54.900
The night she OD'd,
Katie's brother called me.

34:55.260 --> 34:57.240
He said he needed some morph
for him and Katie.

34:57.529 --> 35:00.239
So I chased down a bag. I gave
it to him outside her apartment.

35:01.666 --> 35:04.196
He's lying.
I don't even use drugs.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.766
Then you wouldn't mind
submitting to a urine test.

35:06.838 --> 35:10.048
I wasn't there.
I was at Yale.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.879
I don't even know
where my sister was living.

35:13.011 --> 35:15.181
We can call the dean and
check your attendance records.

35:15.247 --> 35:18.247
Sol blew off Bankruptcy 101.
Big deal.

35:18.683 --> 35:21.433
You must have also
missed Evidence 102.

35:22.854 --> 35:26.564
We match your prints on this cup to
any prints at Katie's apartment,

35:26.825 --> 35:28.025
and you're cooked.

35:30.095 --> 35:31.895
What happened,
Mr. Blanchard?

35:40.138 --> 35:41.378
What happened?

35:43.275 --> 35:44.645
We got high together.

35:52.984 --> 35:56.524
When she started convulsing,
I panicked.

35:57.422 --> 36:01.532
I didn't know what to do. I
didn't want anyone to find...

36:04.329 --> 36:06.829
I called Jerry.

36:08.533 --> 36:09.533
He came over.

36:11.469 --> 36:13.309
He told me to
get the hell out of there.

36:16.074 --> 36:17.824
He said he'd
take care of Katie.

36:22.981 --> 36:23.981
(SIGHS)

36:25.383 --> 36:28.993
Kamen took responsibility to
save her, and he didn't do it.

36:29.888 --> 36:32.028
It was his opportunity
to let her die.

36:32.457 --> 36:34.157
Her brother gave her the drugs.

36:34.226 --> 36:37.036
Now, don't you think that
a jury might conclude

36:37.429 --> 36:39.309
that he's to blame
for her death?

36:39.597 --> 36:43.067
There was an intervening act. He tried
to save his sister by calling Kamen.

36:43.134 --> 36:44.174
ADAM: No.

36:45.403 --> 36:49.413
You try Kamen for murder, it's
his word against the brother's.

36:49.674 --> 36:51.484
There's still evidence
she was in his car.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.553
No. That was
ruled inadmissible.

36:53.612 --> 36:55.852
We can argue
inevitable discovery.

36:55.947 --> 36:58.327
No. No. No. No.
It won't fly.

36:58.850 --> 37:02.530
Kamen was acting as her surrogate father.
He was responsible.

37:02.587 --> 37:06.057
He could've called 911. He could've
rushed her to an emergency room.

37:06.391 --> 37:09.271
Instead he left her to die in
the cold behind a trash bin.

37:09.895 --> 37:14.435
Can you offer admissible evidence
that he transported her?

37:16.067 --> 37:17.267
(SIGHS)

37:18.136 --> 37:20.476
We present his motive,
that he was being blackmailed,

37:20.538 --> 37:23.248
the jury will figure out for
themselves how she got from A to B.

37:25.043 --> 37:26.923
Fine.
Take them through it.

37:30.849 --> 37:32.689
MATTHEW:
She filled up the syringe.

37:33.985 --> 37:38.955
She asked me to inject her. A few minutes
after, she started having a seizure.

37:39.290 --> 37:40.670
I didn't know what to do.

37:41.059 --> 37:42.399
I called Mr. Kamen.

37:42.827 --> 37:44.697
And what happened
as a result of your call?

37:45.130 --> 37:46.610
He came right over.

37:46.965 --> 37:49.405
But by then, her eyes were
rolling back in her head.

37:51.136 --> 37:54.446
I tried to revive her, but
Mr. Kamen told me I should leave.

37:55.540 --> 37:59.280
He said I would get kicked out of
Yale if anyone found out I was there.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.152
I never should've left.

38:02.580 --> 38:05.360
Did you have any communication
with Mr. Kamen after that?

38:05.650 --> 38:10.260
Yes. He called me the next day.
He told me Katie was dead.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.456
He made it sound like
it was my fault.

38:13.892 --> 38:16.672
He said he'd keep
his mouth shut to protect me.

38:17.395 --> 38:21.235
And what was your sister's condition
when you left her with Mr. Kamen?

38:22.400 --> 38:23.540
She was alive.

38:29.441 --> 38:30.441
(CLEARS THROAT)

38:30.742 --> 38:33.662
Mr. Blanchard,
why would you call my client?

38:33.712 --> 38:36.122
Does he have some special
expertise with overdoses?

38:36.214 --> 38:39.254
Ever since we were little,
whenever we got into trouble,

38:39.317 --> 38:40.657
we knew we could count on him.

38:41.019 --> 38:42.899
For example, when you were
expelled from Choate?

38:45.423 --> 38:46.563
Yes.

38:48.059 --> 38:50.969
He let me stay with him until
he could talk to my father.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.669
And why were you
kicked out of Choate?

38:52.730 --> 38:53.870
Objection.

38:54.199 --> 38:55.609
Goes to credibility,
Your Honor.

38:55.667 --> 38:58.267
Overruled.
The witness will answer.

38:59.971 --> 39:02.651
They found marijuana
in my room.

39:03.074 --> 39:04.144
So you're a drug addict?

39:04.209 --> 39:05.519
I'm not an addict.

39:06.077 --> 39:09.457
I only smoked heroin once or
twice a month, on the weekends.

39:09.514 --> 39:12.434
POLLARD: But if anybody found out your
little secret, you would be in big trouble.

39:12.484 --> 39:13.494
Isn't that right?

39:13.551 --> 39:14.621
Yes.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.963
And if anybody found out
that you had injected

39:17.021 --> 39:19.161
your sister with
a lethal dose of heroin,

39:19.224 --> 39:21.474
you would be in very big
trouble, isn't that correct?

39:21.526 --> 39:23.226
I already admitted what I did.

39:23.294 --> 39:26.044
And if anybody has a reason
to move your sister's body

39:26.097 --> 39:28.297
to hide the circumstances of her
death, it's you. Isn't it...

39:28.366 --> 39:30.306
I didn't move her. Mr. Kamen said...
Nothing further.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.438
He would help her.

39:33.304 --> 39:37.554
Jerome Kamen held full discretionary
authority over the joint trust account.

39:38.109 --> 39:41.579
But I gave him specific instructions
not to give any money to my daughter.

39:42.047 --> 39:45.517
Every dime she got her hands on
went to drugs. He knew that.

39:45.583 --> 39:50.463
Of the $346,000 withdrawn
by Mr. Kamen,

39:50.555 --> 39:53.465
were you able to ascertain how
much of it went to the children?

39:53.725 --> 39:57.605
To the best of my knowledge, only
$33,000 were spent on my children.

39:58.196 --> 40:00.176
I haven't been able
to account for the rest.

40:01.132 --> 40:02.132
Thank you.

40:07.805 --> 40:09.805
Didn't you forbid Katie
to live in the family home

40:09.874 --> 40:11.724
or any of the other houses
that you own?

40:12.544 --> 40:14.054
You make it sound so easy.

40:14.879 --> 40:18.729
The psychiatrist said that it was best
for her and for my other children.

40:18.883 --> 40:20.563
POLLARD: She was a destructive
influence on them?

40:20.618 --> 40:22.358
She only really hurt herself.

40:22.887 --> 40:25.527
Didn't you also forbid her to contact
any other member of the family

40:25.590 --> 40:26.800
except through my client?

40:26.858 --> 40:28.128
I had to protect them.

40:28.726 --> 40:30.096
Katie could be
very manipulative...

40:30.161 --> 40:31.371
So it fell on my client

40:31.429 --> 40:32.839
to shoulder
the sole responsibility

40:32.897 --> 40:35.667
for your self-destructive,
drug-addicted daughter,

40:35.900 --> 40:38.070
is that right? MRS. BLANCHARD:
I was at my wit's end.

40:38.136 --> 40:40.616
Cutting her off was the best
thing I could do as her mother.

40:41.472 --> 40:43.952
No matter how much I wanted to,
I couldn't work a miracle.

40:45.877 --> 40:49.417
But what's his excuse? He stole
from her, he bought her drugs.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.464
Or he bought her food
and gave her shelter.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.793
Or would you prefer that he be
as cold and heartless as you

40:54.853 --> 40:56.993
and let your daughter die a
miserable death on the streets?

40:57.055 --> 40:58.125
Objection!

40:58.189 --> 40:59.859
She doesn't
have to answer that.

41:03.595 --> 41:07.125
The money was there, I had discretionary
authority. I gave it to her.

41:07.498 --> 41:10.098
Simple as that.
Nothing criminal about it.

41:10.602 --> 41:14.312
But I can understand why Mrs. Blanchard
blames me for Katie's death.

41:15.039 --> 41:16.279
Can you explain it to us?

41:18.109 --> 41:21.579
She disowned her daughter. Katie
is dead as a consequence.

41:22.013 --> 41:24.793
But it's easier to blame me.
To cut me off, in a way.

41:25.683 --> 41:28.323
That's how Meryl deals with
everything she finds unpleasant.

41:29.120 --> 41:31.830
POLLARD: The night that Katie died, did
you receive a call from her brother?

41:32.023 --> 41:34.903
I was home most of the night. I
went out to get a bite to eat.

41:34.959 --> 41:37.869
When I came home, my answering
machine was flashing.

41:38.663 --> 41:39.773
But no one left a message.

41:39.964 --> 41:41.604
And did you see
Miss Blanchard that night?

41:41.666 --> 41:42.696
No.

41:43.701 --> 41:46.201
And if I had, I certainly
hope I could've saved her.

41:46.971 --> 41:47.971
Thank you.

41:53.411 --> 41:57.151
Why did you lie when the police first
interviewed you about Miss Blanchard?

41:57.849 --> 42:02.129
As I explained, I was concerned
about my professional reputation.

42:02.220 --> 42:05.530
And not because you were present
when Miss Blanchard overdosed?

42:05.623 --> 42:06.693
I wasn't there.

42:06.791 --> 42:09.531
And not because you
transported her in your car?

42:12.196 --> 42:14.696
Maybe I didn't say it
loud enough the first time.

42:14.966 --> 42:16.736
I didn't see her that night.

42:16.801 --> 42:19.811
Then how do you explain the fact
that her vomit was in your car?

42:19.871 --> 42:21.821
Objection. Your Honor.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.583
I'll see counsel in chambers.

42:25.743 --> 42:29.193
This is grounds for a mistrial.
Not to mention sanctions.

42:29.480 --> 42:31.020
Your Honor
suppressed this evidence.

42:31.082 --> 42:32.622
Settle down, Mr. Pollard.

42:32.717 --> 42:35.697
Mr. McCoy, I'll bet you were the
kind of child who touched the plate

42:35.787 --> 42:37.527
even when your mom
told you it was hot.

42:37.589 --> 42:41.539
Mr. Kamen is on the stand lying
about moving Miss Blanchard's body.

42:41.626 --> 42:43.966
I have every right
to challenge his credibility.

42:44.028 --> 42:47.098
Oh, sure. Why let a little thing like
the Fourth Amendment stand in the way,

42:47.165 --> 42:49.835
especially when you can sneak the
evidence in through the back door?

42:49.901 --> 42:52.811
The Constitution says I can't convict
your client with the evidence.

42:53.104 --> 42:55.554
Where does it say that I can't
use it to prove him a liar?

42:55.607 --> 42:58.047
A jury isn't gonna make that fine
a distinction, and you know it.

42:58.109 --> 43:01.679
I'll make sure they do, Mr. Pollard.
I'll charge the jury accordingly.

43:02.280 --> 43:04.990
The evidence is admissible
to challenge credibility

43:05.149 --> 43:07.529
but will not be used
for liability.

43:07.685 --> 43:10.825
The question will stand,
and the witness will answer.

43:11.289 --> 43:12.699
We'll resume after lunch.

43:12.757 --> 43:15.167
Jack, your office, 10 minutes?

43:19.330 --> 43:22.610
You may get the evidence in now, but
you know it never survives an appeal.

43:23.434 --> 43:26.424
I'll worry about that after the jury
convicts your client of murder.

43:26.471 --> 43:30.511
This is nuts. Katie was
a junkie. Junkies die.

43:30.808 --> 43:33.048
Anyone who knew her
could've predicted that.

43:33.144 --> 43:36.064
Nothing is inevitable,
Mr. Kamen, except your residency

43:36.147 --> 43:39.247
at one of our correctional facilities.
You're a liar.

43:39.384 --> 43:41.164
And now the jury knows
you're a liar.

43:44.122 --> 43:45.502
I've made my case.

43:51.396 --> 43:54.096
Man two, minimum sentence to cover
all counts of the indictment.

43:54.165 --> 43:56.575
Man one, 8113-to-25.

43:56.968 --> 43:59.948
What kind of a deal is that? Do
you expect him to serve the max?

44:00.004 --> 44:03.424
Yes. And after that
he does two years for larceny.

44:05.109 --> 44:06.819
You have a minute
to make up your mind.

44:08.646 --> 44:09.846
I can't believe this.

44:11.048 --> 44:12.988
I was driving her
to the damn hospital.

44:14.185 --> 44:16.625
And what hospital was that,
Mr. Kamen?

44:23.461 --> 44:24.701
I can't recall.

44:28.032 --> 44:32.172
But I didn't do anything wrong.
Meryl didn't care about her.

44:33.371 --> 44:35.651
If it weren't for me, she
would've been dead months ago.

44:36.374 --> 44:40.084
Even if she survived this overdose, it was
just a matter of time till the next one.

44:40.978 --> 44:44.618
She was in pain,
she was killing herself.

44:44.682 --> 44:48.532
She wanted this. Somebody
had to make a decision.

44:48.786 --> 44:50.926
It wasn't your
decision to make.

44:50.988 --> 44:52.758
It was my decision.

44:54.158 --> 44:56.898
Ken Blanchard was
my friend for 35 years.

44:57.662 --> 45:00.402
I was the only one he would
entrust with his children.

45:01.566 --> 45:03.666
That family can't survive
without me.

45:04.569 --> 45:07.739
I pay their bills,
I invest their money,

45:08.706 --> 45:12.236
I clean up the messes they make.
I damn well run their lives.

45:12.777 --> 45:16.657
And Meryl dares accuse me
of stealing from them?

45:17.448 --> 45:20.728
No, sir. I was entitled.

45:22.487 --> 45:25.627
I'm not gonna waste a minute
regretting anything I've done.

45:29.060 --> 45:31.340
You'll be regretting it
