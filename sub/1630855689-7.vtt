**

00:10.260 --> 00:10.510
**

00:12.721 --> 00:15.015
[announcer]
- All right, everybody!

00:15.056 --> 00:17.600
Who's ready for
"Billy & 2 Scoops?"

00:17.642 --> 00:20.603
[cheers and applause]

00:21.396 --> 00:22.605
[assistant director]
- Stand by for first team.

00:22.647 --> 00:29.154
**

00:29.195 --> 00:30.405
- I don't get it.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.282
The show has always
been called "2 Scoops."

00:32.323 --> 00:34.909
They can't just add Billy
to the title for no reason.

00:34.951 --> 00:37.412
- Marcus, honey,
they have a great reason.

00:37.454 --> 00:41.124
Everyone loves Billy!
- I know I do.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.500
- But I'm the lead.
So what?

00:42.542 --> 00:44.461
Billy gets a few laughs.
Now, he's the next Urkel?

00:44.502 --> 00:47.547
I mean, even Billy's fanclub
is twice the size of mine.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.924
- Well, he's twice as funny.
[laughs]

00:49.966 --> 00:52.510
- Stop it.
Your dad is so bad.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.554
- Well, at least
he's not my real dad.

00:56.681 --> 00:59.559
- You know, you should thank
your lucky stars for that.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.353
Hmm?

01:01.394 --> 01:02.729
You'd still be living
in a taxi cab

01:02.771 --> 01:06.775
if your unhinged father
didn't go to jail.

01:06.816 --> 01:08.985
Go, take your mark.

01:09.027 --> 01:09.819
[assistant director]
- All right.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.905
We're gettin' ready to go.

01:11.946 --> 01:14.574
[bell ringing]

01:14.616 --> 01:15.784
[announcer]
- All right, gang,

01:15.825 --> 01:17.535
we've got
a great show for you today.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.454
We hope you all...
[indistinct chatter]

01:23.458 --> 01:27.837
- Okay, here we go.
Ready, three, two, one.

01:27.879 --> 01:30.548
[applause]

01:33.718 --> 01:36.888
- Mmm.
- Lenny Scoops, you slow down!

01:36.930 --> 01:39.599
You'll hurt your tummy.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.518
- Oh, yeah?

01:41.559 --> 01:44.646
Tell that to my sweet tooth!

01:44.688 --> 01:47.357
[sparse laughter]

01:49.984 --> 01:52.112
- We have to open
the ice cream store.

01:52.153 --> 01:56.741
I wonder what's taking
Billy so long?

01:56.783 --> 01:57.992
[toilet flushing]

01:58.034 --> 02:01.663
[laughter]

02:02.997 --> 02:05.083
- He's so cute!

02:05.125 --> 02:08.253
[laughter, applause]

02:08.294 --> 02:12.132
[Meemaw]
- Marcus!

02:12.173 --> 02:14.801
[dog barks]

02:14.843 --> 02:17.762
Marcus, it's your line.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.353
Oh!

02:32.027 --> 02:34.237
- Oh, my fucking God!
Holy shit!

02:34.279 --> 02:35.905
[screaming]

02:35.947 --> 02:37.657
- Who's a good boy
now, Billy?

02:37.699 --> 02:40.201
[screaming]

02:41.870 --> 02:43.788
- God! Oh, shit!

02:49.919 --> 02:50.879
Line?

03:00.221 --> 03:03.350
- Hello?

03:03.391 --> 03:06.394
Anybody in there?

03:06.436 --> 03:09.105
How the hell am I supposed
to pick up this package?

03:09.147 --> 03:10.273
- Cross the moat.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.941
- Hell no! You go.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.651
- Uh, that water
is gross as fuck.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.820
I'm not swimming
in that toilet river.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.951
- This doesn't
make any sense.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.370
- I'm gonna throw
a rock at it.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.538
- Oh, great idea, genius.

03:25.580 --> 03:29.834
[grunts]

03:29.876 --> 03:31.628
[elevator dings]

03:35.757 --> 03:36.883
Don't you say it.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.593
Um...
- Oh!

03:38.635 --> 03:41.012
- Right here.
- I-- I told you so.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.605
[creepy voice]
- This way.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.650
- The fuck?
Where are you goin'?

03:53.692 --> 03:55.568
- You heard the creepy
disembodied voice.

03:55.610 --> 03:58.488
"This way."
Come on, coward.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.115
[creepy voice]
- Getting warmer.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.158
[laughing]

04:02.200 --> 04:03.284
- Now he's giggling.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.703
I can't believe
you're enjoying this.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.746
- Oh, come on.
It's like a haunted house.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.791
The smoke, the creepy lighting.
I'm half expecting

04:09.833 --> 04:12.419
a vampire to just pop out
of the smoke and say--

04:12.460 --> 04:13.420
[creepy voice]
- Hello.

04:13.461 --> 04:15.338
[screaming]
- God-- Oh, my God.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.382
You got me, man.
[laughing]

04:17.424 --> 04:19.134
Oh, please tell me
you live down here.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.635
[laughing]

04:20.677 --> 04:23.388
[creepy voice]
- Oh, no.
I don't live down here.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.931
[gasping]
- Twist!

04:24.973 --> 04:26.266
- I don't have time
for this tomfoolery.

04:26.307 --> 04:27.726
Show yourself.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.520
[creepy voice]
- Why would I reveal my face?

04:30.562 --> 04:34.024
You see,
there's power in anonymity.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.817
- Wait a minute.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.194
Are you Calypso?

04:38.236 --> 04:39.696
[Calypso]
- What?

04:39.738 --> 04:42.282
- I read that name everywhere.
"Believe in Calypso."

04:42.323 --> 04:45.744
"Calypso is real."
- Yeah! Are you him?

04:45.785 --> 04:47.412
[creepy laughter]

04:47.454 --> 04:49.581
- I guess that means yes.
- Huh.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.125
[buzzer]

04:52.167 --> 04:54.794
- Secret compartment.
Choice.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.465
- Hey, Calypso, I usually
get a supply bump

04:58.506 --> 05:01.468
when picking up deliveries.
We need gas, man.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.219
[Calypso]
- The package
is what you've earned.

05:03.261 --> 05:07.599
No more, no less,
no free handouts.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.309
- Well, can we at least
get a peek inside?

05:09.351 --> 05:11.144
- Or a deep dish
for the road?

05:11.186 --> 05:12.479
- What are you gonna
do with a dish?

05:12.520 --> 05:14.689
- It's not a dish, dummy.
It's a pizza.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.858
Oh, my God.
Have you never had pizza?

05:16.900 --> 05:19.235
Oh, we have to try it.
It's like, uh--

05:19.277 --> 05:21.071
imagine a wheel
made of bread and cheese.

05:21.112 --> 05:24.199
- Oh, fuck. I want that.
- Yeah, we want that.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.494
[Calypso]
- You have what you need.
Now, get.

05:27.535 --> 05:30.705
Take it back to Raven
like a good milkman.

05:30.747 --> 05:35.168
Your San Francisco treat awaits.
Ding ding.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.295
- This is really well done.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.005
[Calypso]
- Thank you.

05:41.216 --> 05:45.845
Oh, and John, may all
your wishes come true.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.848
[laughs]

05:57.941 --> 05:59.067
- I mean, I gotta hand it
to that Calypso guy.

06:00.276 --> 06:02.362
What a showman.
Do you think that steam

06:02.404 --> 06:04.030
was actually coming
from the pipes,

06:04.072 --> 06:06.157
or do you think
it was dry ice

06:06.199 --> 06:08.118
that he filtered in
for ambiance.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.202
- I'm more concerned
with making it

06:09.244 --> 06:11.371
to New San Francisco
in one piece.

06:11.413 --> 06:13.373
[brakes squeal]
- Just let me take the wheel.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.958
- I got it. See?

06:17.252 --> 06:19.838
We can't go back the way
we came after Topeka,

06:19.879 --> 06:23.174
so now we're gonna have to go
north and hook back around.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.052
[laughs]
There's a Pits.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.138
- Cool.
That sounds awesome.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.098
Should we stop
at the Taints after?

06:30.140 --> 06:31.099
- Funny.

06:31.141 --> 06:33.268
It's an old milkman pitstop.

06:33.309 --> 06:35.979
You stop off, share intel
on delivery routes,

06:36.021 --> 06:38.940
gas up, maybe get some chow.
Shit, maybe even a shower.

06:38.982 --> 06:42.402
- Uh, why the fuck didn't
we stop by one sooner?

06:42.444 --> 06:44.362
- Well, 'cause there are
only two of them left.

06:44.404 --> 06:47.657
They have very strict
ground rules.

06:47.699 --> 06:51.244
Rule one--
don't talk about your job.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.704
No one cares
what you're moving,

06:52.746 --> 06:54.164
but what you're getting paid--
that's a different story,

06:54.205 --> 06:56.249
so we leave it at the door.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.752
- Rule two--
no weapons allowed.

06:58.793 --> 07:01.546
- Anything can be a weapon.
I stabbed you with a pen.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.466
What about your hands?
You can strangle, pummel.

07:04.507 --> 07:07.927
You can thumb-fuck the eyes.
- Your hands aren't that strong.

07:09.846 --> 07:13.600
- They seem pretty strong to me.
- I'll pull over.

07:13.641 --> 07:16.353
- Why would you do that?
We're on a schedule.

07:16.394 --> 07:20.357
- Woah! Oh, got it. Oh--
[chuckling]

07:20.398 --> 07:22.442
[tires screech]

07:28.740 --> 07:30.367
[Roberts]
- Roberts for Agent Stone.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.911
Come in Agent Stone.

07:34.245 --> 07:35.455
- Go for Stone.

07:35.497 --> 07:36.873
[Roberts]
- Agent Stone, sir, it's--

07:36.915 --> 07:38.833
- Look, this better be about
the mute and the milkman.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.835
[Roberts]
- Sir, it's the clown.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.379
Sweet Tooth hit
our Colorado outpost,

07:42.420 --> 07:44.089
just like Utah
and the dam.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.133
He killed everyone and took
the prisoners with him.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.969
[sighing]
- Fuck! Ah! Ugh!

07:50.011 --> 07:53.473
No. Oh, no.

07:53.515 --> 07:54.849
[Roberts]
- Also, not urgent,

07:54.891 --> 07:57.435
but there was a small snafu
at the motor pool.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.145
Minor collision,
Jamie and I are fine but--

07:59.187 --> 08:00.313
[Jamie]
- Shut up, he doesn't
want to hear it.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.481
[Roberts]
- You don't know that.

08:01.523 --> 08:02.691
[Jamie]
- Uh, sir, everything's fine.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.025
- Listen.

08:04.067 --> 08:08.279
Nevada, Utah, Colorado.

08:08.321 --> 08:12.409
These are not just
random attacks.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.745
That smiley faced son of a bitch
is going somewhere.

08:15.787 --> 08:28.842
**

08:28.883 --> 08:30.969
- Now, don't go asking
for different drink flavors.

08:31.011 --> 08:34.639
You get what you get,
and you don't get upset.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.600
So, eat up
and take your shits.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.728
Maybe play some
pick-up basketball.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.313
No snack for you.
You're with me.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.191
Come on.
- Sure.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.027
- Harold!
You're in charge.

08:49.571 --> 08:53.658
- Uh, everything okay?
- Ah, sweet of you to ask.

08:53.700 --> 08:57.287
Look at my fan club.
Growing every day.

08:57.328 --> 09:00.373
But not everybody
believed in me.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.459
We didn't just stop here
for poops and hoops.

09:02.500 --> 09:06.796
We're here
for something important.

09:06.838 --> 09:08.548
- What?

09:12.093 --> 09:14.179
- Closure.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.097
[growling]

09:20.602 --> 09:23.730
- Ow! Steering wheel. Ugh.

09:23.772 --> 09:27.400
- Evelyn leave a love mark?
She likes to play rough.

09:27.442 --> 09:31.905
- She's not a real girl, John.
- I know.

09:31.946 --> 09:35.158
- So, this is where
the milkmen hang out.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.243
Wow, it really is the pits.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.079
All right,
let's divide and conquer.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.622
- My thoughts exactly.

09:40.663 --> 09:43.249
I bless you
an honorary milkman.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.169
You gas up, I supply up.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.006
Hey.

09:59.474 --> 10:02.435
- Hey piss flaps,
I was next.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.062
[growling]

10:12.320 --> 10:15.490
- At least get a girl off
before treating her like shit.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.283
- I outta choke you.

10:17.325 --> 10:20.120
- Ooh, promise?

10:20.161 --> 10:22.330
[laughting]

10:22.372 --> 10:23.248
[grunts]

10:23.289 --> 10:24.499
Bye, Grady.

10:24.541 --> 10:27.127
[chuckles]

10:27.168 --> 10:28.962
He's got nothing.

10:29.004 --> 10:30.839
Tiny little penis.

10:30.880 --> 10:31.798
You're up.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.717
- Thanks.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.094
I thought, uh, weapons
weren't allowed.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.304
[gasps]

10:38.346 --> 10:39.889
- Oops!

10:39.931 --> 10:44.728
**

10:44.769 --> 10:46.646
I haven't seen you
around here.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.398
Are you taking over
a territory?

10:48.440 --> 10:50.525
- Oh, no.
I'm here with--

10:50.567 --> 10:51.985
- Johnny?

10:52.027 --> 10:52.986
- Mary?

10:53.028 --> 10:54.487
- Oh, my God.

10:54.529 --> 10:58.158
- Hmm.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.784
- Hi.

10:59.826 --> 11:00.744
[groans]

11:00.785 --> 11:02.746
You left me for dead,
asshole!

11:02.787 --> 11:04.873
- I thought you were dead,
asshole!

11:04.914 --> 11:06.833
- I guess you two
know each other?

11:06.875 --> 11:08.918
- What--
wait-wait-wait-wait.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.130
You're with this
son of a bitch?

11:12.172 --> 11:15.967
[laughing]

11:16.009 --> 11:18.678
How clenched do you think
his butthole is right now?

11:18.720 --> 11:20.513
- Oh, I'm gonna guess
it's pretty tight.

11:20.555 --> 11:23.475
- Mm-hm, like a teeny
tiny starfish.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.684
Did you miss me?

11:30.148 --> 11:32.650
**

11:32.692 --> 11:35.487
So seven shots in,

11:35.528 --> 11:38.281
Johnny bets me he can
surf his car.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.699
[scoffing]

11:39.741 --> 11:42.035
We go out in the parking lot.
He gets Evelyn to 60.

11:42.077 --> 11:45.121
And as he climbs
through the window, bam!

11:45.163 --> 11:47.624
His ass ragdolls
on the concrete.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.625
[laughing]

11:48.667 --> 11:50.460
Just blood pouring
out of his head.

11:50.502 --> 11:51.628
- [Quiet]
It's so funny,

11:51.670 --> 11:53.630
because he told me
that he got that scar

11:53.672 --> 11:56.758
from a seven-on-one
vulture car chase.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.176
- That's how I got
the other scar.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.886
- Mm-hm.
- Uh-huh.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.805
So, how did you two meet?

12:01.846 --> 12:04.140
- My mother,
may she rest in peace,

12:04.182 --> 12:07.977
ran one of the first pits
in sunny San Juan Capistrano.

12:08.019 --> 12:09.646
When she croaked,
I took over

12:09.688 --> 12:12.399
and Johnny would pass
through to, um--

12:12.440 --> 12:14.442
what'cha call it?

12:14.484 --> 12:16.069
Drain your tank?

12:16.111 --> 12:17.237
Fill her up.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.321
Nuzzle the guzzle.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.657
- [Quiet]
C'mon, man.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.534
- Then a gang of burnouts
torched the place.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.452
A blessing in disguise,
honestly.

12:24.494 --> 12:28.081
I would've done anything to get
the hell out of there.

12:28.123 --> 12:29.916
Johnny knows.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.960
- I heard about the fire.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.336
- And you didn't
come back for me?

12:33.378 --> 12:37.799
- They said nobody survived.
- Well this bitch did.

12:37.841 --> 12:39.551
Luckily, I knew a place
in a church

12:39.592 --> 12:41.803
where no one
could find me.

12:41.845 --> 12:44.222
- The bell tower?
Oh, my God.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.849
I haven't thought about
that place in ages.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.684
All the bird shit!
- The bird shit!

12:47.726 --> 12:48.852
[laughing]

12:48.893 --> 12:50.687
Of course that's
what you remember.

12:50.729 --> 12:53.481
We made love there.
- So now you're a milkman.

12:53.523 --> 12:56.067
- Mm-hm.
No thanks to you.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.069
I always wanted
to be a milkman,

12:58.111 --> 13:01.531
but no one
took me seriously.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.408
Ain't that right,
Johnny?

13:05.744 --> 13:07.662
So what's
your story, hm?

13:07.704 --> 13:09.122
No way
you're driving cars.

13:09.164 --> 13:12.417
I mean, that ass
is way too perky.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.711
- I'm from the OC where
they cut off body parts

13:14.753 --> 13:16.796
and wear them
like jewelry.

13:16.838 --> 13:18.882
- Sounds fun.

13:18.923 --> 13:22.135
Never leave
a woman's glass empty.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.054
Shots on Johnny!
[pounding]

13:24.095 --> 13:27.557
[cheering]

13:27.599 --> 13:29.476
- Yeah, lucky me.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.813
Okay, Quiet.
Look, about Mary...

13:33.855 --> 13:36.441
- Oh my gosh, you weren't
a virgin when I met you?

13:36.483 --> 13:39.861
I could give two soggy dumps
about your ex.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.696
You're dicking around.
We're on a schedule.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.031
- Dicking around?

13:43.073 --> 13:44.324
Before you came up,
I found out

13:44.366 --> 13:46.201
there was a vultures nest
a few clicks from here

13:46.242 --> 13:48.536
that we definitely
would have driven into.

13:48.578 --> 13:51.581
I say we butter up
these milkmen

13:51.623 --> 13:53.458
with a few buttery nips.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.752
Get what intel we can
and get the hell out of here.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.462
- Okay fine.
One more drink.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.922
- Yeah.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.508
Hey, hey, hey!
[cheering]

14:01.549 --> 14:03.093
All right!

14:03.134 --> 14:04.678
Whoa!

14:04.719 --> 14:07.681
- Bloody Mary's a character,
isn't she?

14:07.722 --> 14:09.933
- Bloody Mary, really?

14:09.974 --> 14:11.142
- [Mr. Slam]
Hey, you're laughing,

14:11.184 --> 14:13.687
but she's made
more runs than anyone.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.730
She'll wipe out
a whole vultures nest

14:15.772 --> 14:17.524
just for craps
and cackles.

14:17.565 --> 14:18.775
[cheering]

14:18.817 --> 14:20.777
Nicknames
mean a lot out here.

14:20.819 --> 14:23.113
We all got one.

14:23.154 --> 14:24.572
Pizza Boy,

14:24.614 --> 14:25.782
Petunia,

14:25.824 --> 14:28.618
Pit Viper.

14:28.660 --> 14:31.496
- Well, I can't wait
to hear yours.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.374
- They call me
Mr. Slam.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.293
- Why?

14:37.335 --> 14:40.171
- 'Cause I can crush anything
with my massive penis.

14:42.007 --> 14:44.759
- Sorry.
[laughing]

14:44.801 --> 14:47.053
[door slams]

14:47.095 --> 14:49.180
You have a shower here?

14:49.222 --> 14:50.306
- Out back.

14:50.348 --> 14:53.018
We got everything
to take the road ass

14:53.059 --> 14:55.812
right off of you.

14:55.854 --> 14:57.647
Here.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.399
For your nooks
and crannies.

14:59.441 --> 15:02.444
- Mr. Slam, don't you worry
about my crannies.

15:02.485 --> 15:03.945
- [Pizza Boy] Pizza, baby!
- [Petunia] Pizza, baby.

15:03.987 --> 15:05.363
- Pizza.
- I'm Pizza guy.

15:05.405 --> 15:09.492
- Yeah. People love pizza.
You never lose.

15:09.534 --> 15:12.704
- You never trust a guy
that wears a jacket inside.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.205
- [Pizza Boy] Yeah,
you fuckin' hang up on him.

15:15.457 --> 15:17.000
- You know,
my parents sent me here

15:17.042 --> 15:19.461
because I got in a disagreement
with my co-star.

15:19.502 --> 15:22.255
Well, actually, they sent me
to the kiddy ward.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.424
And then I moved to
the juvie wellness center.

15:24.466 --> 15:26.843
Oh, and then finally
got bumped up to Blackfield

15:26.885 --> 15:28.261
after I murdered
my roommate.

15:28.303 --> 15:31.681
Trust me, that guy
was a psychopath.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.475
- What did he do?

15:33.516 --> 15:36.353
- He thought Chris Kirkpatrick
was the best member of NSYNC.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.396
Are you nuts?

15:38.438 --> 15:42.692
But this-- this is where
I grew up.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.069
It was hard at first.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.653
Nobody came to see me.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.781
Not even my parents.

15:47.822 --> 15:50.575
They said they would,
but they lied!

15:50.617 --> 15:53.119
[echoes]

15:53.161 --> 15:56.164
- You felt alone.
I get it.

15:56.206 --> 15:58.541
- Don't make this
about you, Stuart.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.794
It's unbecoming.
- Sorry.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.879
[groaning]

16:02.921 --> 16:05.715
- Then I got to know
the guys in here.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.926
And guess what?

16:07.967 --> 16:10.845
They were just like me.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.305
Yeah.

16:12.347 --> 16:14.724
Blackfield was
the best ten years

16:14.766 --> 16:16.476
of my 25-to-life.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.440
Hold onto your butt crack.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.109
We're going in.

16:26.611 --> 16:29.698
Home, sweet home.
[sniffs]

16:29.739 --> 16:32.200
Huh, still smells
the same.

16:35.787 --> 16:46.131
**

16:46.172 --> 16:48.091
- Your co-star was a dog?

16:48.133 --> 16:50.093
- Fuck Billy,
that son of a bitch!

16:50.135 --> 16:53.430
Uh, sorry, Mommy.
I-I didn't mean to swear.

16:55.890 --> 16:58.143
Stu, meet my mommy.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.603
Mommy, meet my Stu.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.939
Hi, Wesley.
That's right.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.983
I still won't
call you dad.

17:05.025 --> 17:07.694
- You-you locked
your parents in here.

17:10.155 --> 17:13.116
- I wrote.
I tried calling.

17:13.158 --> 17:15.285
They ignored me.

17:15.326 --> 17:17.871
They always ignored me.

17:17.912 --> 17:21.124
So when the world ended
and the cell block opened up,

17:21.166 --> 17:22.917
I tracked them down

17:22.959 --> 17:25.045
and I left them
in here to rot,

17:25.086 --> 17:27.881
just like they left me!

17:27.922 --> 17:32.510
- You, uh, you got
their attention now.

17:35.847 --> 17:38.516
- Yeah, I do.

17:40.935 --> 17:43.855
Mommy, Wesley,

17:43.897 --> 17:47.025
I never wanted to try out
for that sitcom.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.568
I was perfectly happy

17:48.610 --> 17:51.029
doing summer stock
in the Berkshires.

17:51.071 --> 17:53.990
But you needed
a Lexus!

17:54.032 --> 17:55.992
You were my parents.

17:56.034 --> 17:58.995
You were supposed
to be my biggest fans!

17:59.037 --> 18:01.081
And you know what?

18:01.122 --> 18:03.416
I don't need
you assholes,

18:03.458 --> 18:06.878
because I have found
my people.

18:06.920 --> 18:10.048
And those guys
out there?

18:10.090 --> 18:14.010
They love me for me!

18:14.052 --> 18:15.470
[screams]

18:19.974 --> 18:21.726
- It's okay.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.020
- I don't need you!

18:24.062 --> 18:25.939
[growling]

18:25.980 --> 18:29.150
[panting]

18:34.906 --> 18:36.241
And that concludes
our tour!

18:39.577 --> 18:54.509
**

18:54.509 --> 18:55.552
**

18:55.593 --> 18:58.847
- Ooh, I'd kill
for those areolas.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.015
Bump?

19:00.056 --> 19:02.100
- Uh, nah.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.561
- All right.
[sniffs]

19:04.602 --> 19:06.187
Ah.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.566
I know that brand.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.901
You lost a finger and you got
the law on your ass?

19:11.943 --> 19:14.404
Are you crazy
or just unlucky?

19:14.446 --> 19:16.072
- Bit of both, I guess.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.575
- Me too.

19:18.616 --> 19:19.534
Check it.

19:21.286 --> 19:23.580
- You got those from law?
- A few of them.

19:23.621 --> 19:26.249
Mostly from being
a pedestrian.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.376
After the fire,
I had to start fresh.

19:28.418 --> 19:32.589
I got this one from playing
possum with some butchers.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.299
Between you and me,

19:34.341 --> 19:36.634
grilled dude
tastes not that bad.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.889
- Hey,
you're on my shit.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.265
- Oops.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.153
So what's it like
driving with Johnny?

19:55.195 --> 19:56.446
Is it as wet and wild

19:56.488 --> 19:58.239
as he always said
it would be?

19:58.281 --> 20:01.368
[scoffing]
- He would say wet and wild.

20:01.409 --> 20:04.204
Riding with John
is mostly irritating.

20:04.245 --> 20:05.497
I'm sure
I'll get used to it.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.874
It's only been
a couple days.

20:07.916 --> 20:10.043
- You just met and you're
already goin' on rides?

20:10.085 --> 20:12.545
[chuckling]

20:12.587 --> 20:14.381
- I mean, just this one job.

20:14.422 --> 20:16.341
[sighs]
- [Mary] Well, must be nice.

20:16.383 --> 20:17.967
Johnny always said
it would be too dangerous

20:18.009 --> 20:19.969
for me to ride with him.

20:20.011 --> 20:22.639
Milkman have
an expiration date,

20:22.681 --> 20:24.641
blah, blah, blah.

20:24.683 --> 20:27.227
Guess I had to
figure it out for myself.

20:30.522 --> 20:33.191
- Listen, I wouldn't
read too much into it.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.568
It's not like he lets me
drive his car.

20:35.610 --> 20:38.446
- Of course not.

20:38.488 --> 20:41.658
But I see the way
he looks at you.

20:41.700 --> 20:42.951
He likes you.

20:42.992 --> 20:46.538
Like, like likes you.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.249
But he will never
pick you over that car.

20:50.583 --> 20:54.170
Evelyn is
his ride or die.

20:54.212 --> 20:56.631
Till death do they part.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.259
But what do I know?

20:59.300 --> 21:01.052
[laughing]

21:01.094 --> 21:04.264
Maybe he likes you
behind the wheel.

21:04.305 --> 21:06.891
Or the wheel behind you.

21:09.561 --> 21:11.730
- Naptime's over, fuck-os!

21:11.771 --> 21:13.523
Time to go--

21:13.565 --> 21:17.235
**

21:17.277 --> 21:20.739
No! Harold,
why did you kill everybody?

21:20.780 --> 21:28.997
**

21:29.039 --> 21:31.291
- Oh, shit.
Get down!

21:31.332 --> 21:32.709
[gun firing]

21:32.751 --> 21:35.879
[yelping]

21:35.920 --> 21:38.548
- {Carl] It's gonna be maggot
Thanksgiving down there.

21:38.590 --> 21:40.425
- That's a good one, Carl.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.385
Jamie, you and your brother,
back with me to base.

21:42.427 --> 21:43.678
Mike, get another guy.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.806
Double taps on everybody,
collect their weapons.

21:46.848 --> 21:48.266
- Uh-huh.

21:48.308 --> 21:50.769
- And grab the clown's mask.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.896
I want it for my wall.

21:52.937 --> 21:54.230
Let's go.

21:54.272 --> 21:56.649
**

21:56.691 --> 21:58.610
- [John Doe] Come on, Ev,
drink up.

22:01.446 --> 22:04.574
Damn, running water
always makes me have to go.

22:06.659 --> 22:07.911
[grunting]

22:07.952 --> 22:09.913
Oh fuck, Mare!

22:09.954 --> 22:11.164
Do you mind?

22:11.206 --> 22:13.458
- No.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.127
[urine trickling]

22:16.169 --> 22:19.631
So Johnny,
what brings you out east?

22:19.673 --> 22:21.591
- Pfft! Are you serious?
- [Mary] Yeah.

22:21.633 --> 22:23.551
- I mean, come on!
My job!

22:23.593 --> 22:26.096
You know I can't
give you the deets.

22:26.137 --> 22:29.307
- Your job.
[laughing]

22:29.349 --> 22:31.434
John Doe would never
leave California.

22:31.476 --> 22:32.560
It gets too cold,

22:32.602 --> 22:36.022
and he doesn't
like goosepimples.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.941
- Maybe it's
a really good job.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.818
- Oh!
- Ooohh!

22:39.859 --> 22:42.278
- Maybe that's why
you need a partner.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.780
- No, okay, it's not
like I recruited her.

22:43.822 --> 22:45.615
She kinda just
fell in my lap.

22:45.657 --> 22:47.325
- Mmm.
- I didn't mean like that.

22:47.367 --> 22:49.119
Look, Quiet saved my ass.

22:49.160 --> 22:52.163
If it wasn't for her,
I'd be road sauce right now.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.332
- Oh, I mean, I've been
doin' it alone for a while.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.084
I seem to be doin' fine.

22:56.126 --> 22:58.211
[scoffing]
Oh.

22:58.253 --> 23:00.046
Unless you're gettin' soft.
- Soft--

23:00.088 --> 23:02.257
Oh, okay.
- Yeah, gettin' soft.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.467
- Well, good thing
it's my last run.

23:08.013 --> 23:11.224
It's gettin' cold out here.
I'm gonna head in.

23:11.266 --> 23:14.060
- Your last run?
- Huh?

23:14.102 --> 23:16.730
- Come on,
you can tell me.

23:16.771 --> 23:18.565
You used to tell me
all kinds of crazy shit.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.442
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay?

23:20.483 --> 23:22.861
And I told you shit, too.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.446
- Well, let's just say

23:24.487 --> 23:27.699
I'm gonna get
what I always wanted.

23:29.409 --> 23:30.410
- No.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.037
[pops lips]

23:33.204 --> 23:36.166
Inside?
- Mmm, oh!

23:36.207 --> 23:37.459
- [Quiet] Hey John!
- Yo!

23:37.500 --> 23:38.585
- Thought you'd wanna know,

23:38.626 --> 23:40.003
Mistress Lane's
about to perform.

23:40.045 --> 23:41.546
- I do not wanna miss that!

23:41.588 --> 23:42.839
[door closing]

23:42.881 --> 23:44.007
After the show, I gotta
get back on the road.

23:44.049 --> 23:45.008
- Uh-huh.

23:45.050 --> 23:47.344
- Because
New San Francisco awaits.

23:47.385 --> 23:49.304
- John-- John!
[chuckling]

23:49.346 --> 23:50.764
Are you serious?

23:50.805 --> 23:52.140
- Jello, Mare!

23:52.182 --> 23:54.601
**

23:54.642 --> 23:56.811
[John Doe] Oh, shit!
Oh, I'm good!

24:00.106 --> 24:01.441
- Y'all in the front row,

24:01.483 --> 24:03.818
you're gonna get wet!

24:06.363 --> 24:07.697
- So, how's the car?

24:07.739 --> 24:11.576
- She's good, gassed up,
and ready to go.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.204
You smell like fresh forest,
like camping.

24:14.245 --> 24:16.247
- Oh! You're drunk.

24:16.289 --> 24:18.875
- You're drunk!!
And also...

24:18.917 --> 24:20.043
I'm drunk.

24:20.085 --> 24:22.253
[crowd chanting]
- [all] Slam! Slam! Slam!

24:22.295 --> 24:24.631
- Slam! Slam! Slam! Slam!
- Slam? Slam?

24:24.673 --> 24:27.759
- Y'all ready to see
this watermelon explode?

24:27.801 --> 24:29.552
Hell yeah!

24:29.594 --> 24:31.346
- Slam!
- Slam!

24:31.388 --> 24:33.640
[chanting "slam!" continues]

24:33.682 --> 24:38.561
Slam! Slam! Slam!
Slam! Slam! Slam!

24:38.603 --> 24:41.773
Slam! Slam! Slam!
Slam! Slam! Slam!

24:41.815 --> 24:44.609
Slam! Slam! Slam!
Slam! Slam! Slam!

24:44.651 --> 24:47.404
- Shh! Shut the fuck up!

24:47.445 --> 24:49.781
- Oh.
[chuckling]

24:49.823 --> 24:51.574
Gee, Johnny,

24:51.616 --> 24:54.411
looks like word got out
about your package.

24:54.452 --> 24:55.662
Guess you're not
the only one

24:55.704 --> 24:59.082
trying to get inside
New San Francisco, huh?

24:59.124 --> 25:01.626
- You couldn't have
waited one minute?!

25:07.632 --> 25:09.759
- You told them about
New San Francisco?

25:09.801 --> 25:11.553
What the hell happened
to rule number one?

25:11.594 --> 25:14.305
- This is why we have
rule number two!

25:14.347 --> 25:21.730
**

25:21.771 --> 25:23.940
- I told you that was
a fuckin' stupid-ass rule!

25:23.982 --> 25:25.025
- All right, fine!

25:25.066 --> 25:27.152
Okay, there's
no need for violence.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.446
I'll give you the package.

25:29.487 --> 25:31.239
But who do
I give it to, huh?

25:31.281 --> 25:33.199
Give it to you?

25:33.241 --> 25:35.827
How about you?

25:35.869 --> 25:38.246
Don't tell me you haven't
discussed amongst yourselves

25:38.288 --> 25:40.081
who's gonna get it.

25:40.123 --> 25:42.292
[laughing]

25:42.334 --> 25:45.754
Getting in is
a pretty big prize.

25:47.464 --> 25:49.632
- Slam!

25:51.092 --> 25:53.428
[grunting, groaning]

25:53.470 --> 25:55.889
[glass shattering]

25:55.930 --> 25:57.265
- Quiet!

25:57.307 --> 25:58.892
[grunting]

25:58.933 --> 26:06.316
**

26:06.358 --> 26:08.193
- John!

26:09.694 --> 26:11.946
[grunting, groaning]

26:19.496 --> 26:21.581
[sinister laughter]

26:23.958 --> 26:25.710
- Careful, you might
nick yourself.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.170
- Not fuckin' likely.

26:27.212 --> 26:28.338
[grunting]

26:28.380 --> 26:37.514
**

26:37.555 --> 26:39.891
- What the hell is
this jacket made of?

26:39.933 --> 26:45.438
**

26:45.480 --> 26:47.607
[grunting]

26:51.236 --> 26:53.321
[panting]

27:01.079 --> 27:02.038
[groaning]

27:02.080 --> 27:04.624
[giggling]
- Is this just me,

27:04.666 --> 27:06.751
or is this kinda hot?

27:06.793 --> 27:07.961
- It's kinda hot.

27:08.003 --> 27:09.713
- Yeah. Do it.

27:09.754 --> 27:11.673
Fuckin' do it.
Gimme another scar.

27:11.715 --> 27:14.509
Add it to the fucking pile!

27:14.551 --> 27:16.136
[weakly chuckling]

27:16.177 --> 27:19.014
I would have followed
that milkman anywhere.

27:19.055 --> 27:22.434
All he had to do was say
"Come with me," but he didn't!

27:22.475 --> 27:24.436
Okay, I suffered
because of him.

27:24.477 --> 27:27.939
So fuck him if he thinks
he can waltz into a better life!

27:27.981 --> 27:30.942
[panting]

27:30.984 --> 27:33.194
- Here's a little
free advice.

27:34.779 --> 27:37.240
Don't let revenge
ruin a second chance.

27:37.282 --> 27:45.081
**

27:45.123 --> 27:46.124
[grunting]

27:46.166 --> 27:47.250
- Behind you!

[groaning]

27:51.546 --> 27:53.089
[laughing]

27:53.131 --> 27:54.257
[thudding]

27:54.299 --> 27:58.011
[panting]

27:58.053 --> 28:00.638
Goddamn, Mary.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.974
[panting]

28:03.016 --> 28:08.688
**

28:08.730 --> 28:11.566
- Hey, Slam!

28:11.608 --> 28:14.277
Nice dong moves.

28:14.319 --> 28:19.282
**

28:19.324 --> 28:20.617
[groaning]

28:20.658 --> 28:22.410
[gun firing]

28:22.452 --> 28:26.664
**

28:26.706 --> 28:28.750
- Stu! Stu!

28:30.502 --> 28:32.796
[sniffling]
I'm so sorry.

28:32.837 --> 28:34.964
I didn't mean to, man.

28:37.092 --> 28:40.011
[gasping]
Holy shit! Shit!

28:40.053 --> 28:42.180
I thought
I killed you, man.

28:42.222 --> 28:44.349
- You tried to kill me?!

28:44.391 --> 28:46.726
- Uh, no?

28:48.395 --> 28:51.439
- [man] No! No, no, no!
- [Sweet Tooth] Who did this?!

28:51.481 --> 28:53.191
Answer me!

28:53.233 --> 28:55.318
Those were my people!

28:55.360 --> 28:58.488
My fans!
[bones cracking]

28:58.530 --> 29:00.031
Oops.

29:00.073 --> 29:01.616
- Fuck-Fuckin' Stone!
It was Stone!

29:01.658 --> 29:03.034
Stone did this, man!

29:03.076 --> 29:05.495
[gagging]

29:05.537 --> 29:07.789
Please! Please! Please!

29:07.831 --> 29:09.958
I can help!
I can help!

29:10.000 --> 29:11.501
I know where Stone is!

29:11.543 --> 29:12.877
[gagging]

29:12.919 --> 29:15.046
- Wait! Stone hurt you.

29:15.088 --> 29:17.173
He can help
hurt him back.

29:19.300 --> 29:22.303
[gasping, coughing]

29:22.345 --> 29:25.515
- You want a pet?
Fine.

29:25.557 --> 29:28.560
But you clean up after him.

29:28.601 --> 29:31.187
'Cause we all know
what I do...

29:31.229 --> 29:33.690
to naughty dogs.

29:33.732 --> 29:36.067
[grunts]

29:41.531 --> 29:45.368
- Here...
You drive.

29:45.410 --> 29:48.079
At least till
I sober up.

29:50.999 --> 29:52.625
[engine starting]

29:52.667 --> 30:05.805
**

30:05.847 --> 30:08.683
- [Stone] They're going
to New San Francisco.

30:08.725 --> 30:12.270
Huh, interesting.

30:12.312 --> 30:15.815
You guys ever shoot
trout in a barrel?

30:15.857 --> 30:19.903
The fun part isn't
actually shooting them.

30:19.944 --> 30:22.781
It's trapping them
in the barrel.

30:22.822 --> 30:25.700
Boy howdy...

30:25.742 --> 30:28.036
do I love a good trap.

30:28.078 --> 30:31.122
**

30:32.582 --> 30:47.138
