<i>Maybe part of everything
we saw and heard</i>

01:39.808 --> 01:42.095
<i>hides other things
that I will never discover...</i>

01:43.103 --> 01:44.103
<i>But now I know</i>

01:44.271 --> 01:47.523
<i>that all actions, even if all
the earth buries them,</i>

01:47.524 --> 01:49.731
<i>will be unearthed sooner or later
for human eyes to see.</i>

01:56.617 --> 02:00.235
2 days earlier

02:27.606 --> 02:29.565
...reconciled with the Father.

02:29.566 --> 02:32.526
Carried on the shoulders of
the Good Shepherd...

02:32.527 --> 02:35.112
and added to the eternal
King's entourage,

02:35.113 --> 02:37.821
rejoice in God's
everlasting glory,

02:37.949 --> 02:40.532
and the company of the Saints.

03:24.079 --> 03:27.039
We are in the town where,
at this time,

03:27.040 --> 03:30.123
the funeral service for Councillor
Felix Montaner is taking place.

03:30.252 --> 03:34.296
As you can see, the square is
packed with family, party members

03:34.297 --> 03:37.800
and locals who have come to bid their
farewells to their former mayor.

03:37.801 --> 03:40.886
<i>His wife Dora Betancor has been
moved to the Intensive Care Unit</i>

03:40.887 --> 03:43.800
<i>in the Malva-Rosa Hospital,
where she will be treated</i> by...

04:06.580 --> 04:07.580
What are you doing here?

04:09.583 --> 04:10.948
I...

04:11.460 --> 04:12.791
...was late for the service.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.042
Right... Classic.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.298
I'm really sorry, shorty.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.051
How are you?

04:24.389 --> 04:25.629
How did you get here?

04:25.807 --> 04:26.807
By plane.

04:29.478 --> 04:30.764
Yeah, fuck.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.938
I hired a car at the airport.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.274
How's your mum?

04:40.113 --> 04:41.444
Let's go and you'll see her.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.535
Why did you leave town?

04:58.465 --> 05:01.583
My parents sent me to a
Numerary boarding school.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.463
Numerary? What's that?

05:05.472 --> 05:06.962
Nothing, you don't want to know.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.471
Now I'm living with some
friends in Perpignan.

05:12.813 --> 05:13.848
And what do you do?

05:14.231 --> 05:15.437
What do you do for work?

05:16.775 --> 05:18.937
I write. I'm a writer.

05:20.111 --> 05:21.272
Writer?

05:21.947 --> 05:22.947
That's good.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.022
And what do you do for work?

05:28.537 --> 05:30.778
No, what do you write:
Stories, novels...?

05:30.956 --> 05:32.446
Can you live off that?

05:32.958 --> 05:33.958
Poetry.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.126
Poetry?

05:37.546 --> 05:38.546
Nice!

05:41.466 --> 05:42.591
Recite something, man.

05:42.592 --> 05:43.332
No... no.

05:43.468 --> 05:44.301
Go on.

05:44.302 --> 05:47.465
- No, no way.
- Something you know by heart.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.796
A stanza, a verse...

05:49.975 --> 05:52.262
A verse, that's what
you call it... A verse.

05:52.602 --> 05:53.602
Recite a verse.

05:55.564 --> 05:56.564
Hold this.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.109
What are you doing?

06:00.235 --> 06:02.772
Nothing, I have a blog
where I sometimes post my stuff.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.945
“The peace that I am forging
will be for the child.

06:12.873 --> 06:13.873
And in the end,

06:14.040 --> 06:16.125
your heart and mine will
be cast away in an ocean

06:16.126 --> 06:17.833
of irredeemable bones, and
all that remains

06:18.378 --> 06:21.962
will be a woman and a man
worn out by kisses."

06:27.304 --> 06:28.465
It's...

06:31.975 --> 06:32.975
You're very good, shorty.

06:36.062 --> 06:36.802
You're good.

06:36.938 --> 06:37.938
Thanks.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.263
Poet.

06:45.113 --> 06:48.276
Some funny guy you
ended up being...

06:49.284 --> 06:50.570
Spanish humour?

06:54.289 --> 06:55.450
Vera is alive.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.124
Eh?

06:58.960 --> 07:00.041
I said Vera's alive.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.035
Yeah, sure...

07:03.798 --> 07:05.789
I saw her this morning,
at the church.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.256
You're fucking with me, right'?

07:24.444 --> 07:25.444
Vera!

07:35.956 --> 07:36.956
Diego?

07:52.055 --> 07:53.055
Jordi...

07:58.895 --> 08:00.431
She's conscious now,

08:00.563 --> 08:03.430
but it's best not to bother her.
She has severe concussion.

08:07.862 --> 08:11.856
"Malva-Rosa" Hospital

08:18.957 --> 08:21.449
Take this. The police brought it.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.868
They're your father's things.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.881
And the mobile phone?

08:30.051 --> 08:31.086
They kept it.

08:31.469 --> 08:34.256
They said they'll return everything
to us in a couple of days.

08:38.476 --> 08:40.261
Are these the house keys?

08:40.895 --> 08:43.307
...at a bar by chance and he
began to show me...

08:43.440 --> 08:46.774
you make quite a lot with cars...

08:52.949 --> 08:53.949
What the fuck?

09:02.250 --> 09:03.250
Diego, Diego.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.457
What are you doing with that?

09:13.094 --> 09:14.584
What if there's somebody inside?

09:39.746 --> 09:41.111
What are you doing with that?

09:42.082 --> 09:43.288
Diego.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.576
It was my father's.

09:44.793 --> 09:45.793
Really?

09:49.756 --> 09:51.246
Stop, fuck! Stop!

09:53.551 --> 09:54.962
It's a fake.

09:55.804 --> 09:58.045
My mother bought it for him
in case somebody broke in'

09:59.390 --> 10:00.972
You're out of your mind.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.060
Jordi!

10:03.478 --> 10:04.478
Sorry, man.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.102
I'll put it down.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.438
Good evening.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.275
Diego Montaner?

10:10.443 --> 10:11.103
That's me.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.568
I'm inspector Alonso, from
the UDEF Department.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.114
I'm in charge of
your father's case.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.275
They've broken into your parents'
flat in Valencia too.

10:17.742 --> 10:21.781
They haven't taken any money,
only computer hard drives.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.539
Do you know if your family has
received any threats lately?

10:27.585 --> 10:29.451
I have to eat protein.

10:30.046 --> 10:33.090
At home it's
aubergine, courgette,

10:33.091 --> 10:34.800
alfalfa all day...

10:34.801 --> 10:36.462
Mum only feeds me greens.

10:39.806 --> 10:40.806
What's up?

10:42.475 --> 10:44.136
Are you still living
with your mum?

10:46.521 --> 10:48.262
What's wrong with you, man?

10:48.773 --> 10:50.559
All right! Things over
there are difficult

10:50.775 --> 10:53.016
What? Do you think money grows on
trees in Argentina?

10:54.779 --> 10:55.779
How old are you?

10:55.780 --> 10:58.115
You've got a comfortable life
over there, right?

10:58.116 --> 10:59.366
You do whatever you want...

10:59.367 --> 11:01.285
What the fuck are
you talking about?

11:01.286 --> 11:02.786
You live in the countryside,

11:02.787 --> 11:04.528
write poetry,

11:04.747 --> 11:06.784
you wait for your daddy's
cheque to arrive...

11:07.750 --> 11:10.037
I would like to write a
book, too.

11:10.253 --> 11:11.584
And travel around the world...

11:12.547 --> 11:13.547
So do it.

11:14.299 --> 11:15.299
Yeah... I might do.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.797
Why are you so sure
your father is still alive?

11:26.811 --> 11:27.811
Why?

11:33.276 --> 11:34.357
Why not?

11:37.530 --> 11:38.770
It's been 20 years.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.233
And where is he buried?

11:49.876 --> 11:52.288
"La Pobla”, 1996

11:54.297 --> 11:55.458
I'm scared.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.298
This has got out of control.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.884
Have you spoken to the police?

12:07.268 --> 12:08.758
I'm leaving with the girls...

12:09.771 --> 12:11.353
but I need the money.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.775
You've brought your family over
from Argentina for this?

12:14.776 --> 12:15.776
Félix...

12:16.236 --> 12:19.945
I'm going to sign the sale of the
land. Don't worry about that.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.363
But I want the money now.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.525
Please...

12:37.882 --> 12:38.963
All right.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.753
Tomorrow morning.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.468
But only...

12:48.309 --> 12:50.141
if you go far away.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.428
Out of the country...

12:54.232 --> 12:55.768
and no questions.

12:57.944 --> 13:01.113
<i>That night was the last time
I saw your father.</i>

13:01.114 --> 13:02.531
Thank you.

13:02.532 --> 13:06.366
It was a few weeks before you and
your mum went back to Argentina.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.570
But let it go, cousin.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.286
It's water under the bridge.

13:15.545 --> 13:16.878
Do you think...

13:16.879 --> 13:19.587
my dad might have had
something to do with...

13:21.092 --> 13:23.049
the “Marjal“ corruption case?

13:24.554 --> 13:28.388
Your father was the only one with
the balls to stand up to my family.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.094
The only one.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.142
I'm gonna take a shower.

13:34.564 --> 13:35.564
Diego,

13:37.442 --> 13:39.103
are your sure it was her?

13:39.944 --> 13:41.935
Do you think I'm lying to you?

13:48.036 --> 13:49.276
Vera saw me too!

13:53.958 --> 13:55.244
<i>Take it.</i>

14:00.965 --> 14:03.548
November, 1996

14:44.550 --> 14:48.760
"The Treehouse"

15:49.115 --> 15:50.115
Hey.

15:51.742 --> 15:53.574
Was here many years ago.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.948
I'm looking for a woman...

16:00.751 --> 16:01.751
Hello?

16:02.128 --> 16:03.128
Hi.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.963
I'm looking for a woman that
lived here with her daughter.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.300
Tirana.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.587
Do you know her?

16:10.553 --> 16:12.385
Have you lived here for long?

16:14.056 --> 16:15.262
Very kind of you!

16:22.440 --> 16:23.440
Hello.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.770
I'm looking for Ricardo,

16:26.944 --> 16:27.944
“El Richi”.

16:29.530 --> 16:30.565
Are you his father?

16:31.115 --> 16:32.776
Who is it, Dad?

16:35.286 --> 16:36.286
Excuse me.

16:38.289 --> 16:39.289
<i>And why are you leaving?</i>

16:39.582 --> 16:40.617
Why?

16:40.958 --> 16:41.958
Yeah, why?

16:42.460 --> 16:43.621
<i>I'm sick of it.</i>

16:44.128 --> 16:46.586
I'm fucking sick of this village.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.091
Ones and zeros, huh?

16:55.598 --> 16:57.555
Look... all my work...

16:57.975 --> 16:58.975
here...

17:00.978 --> 17:02.560
put away in a fucking box.

17:02.730 --> 17:03.765
You see.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.441
Do you take sugar?

17:08.736 --> 17:10.101
Yes, thanks.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.106
Do you smoke?

17:14.242 --> 17:16.233
No, I don't. I quit a while ago.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.739
Do you mind if I...?

17:18.954 --> 17:20.570
No, no. Smoke.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.084
What happened to you?

17:24.085 --> 17:25.575
I crashed my motorbike.

17:35.596 --> 17:39.099
Well... I loved your dad
like a brother.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.306
Yeah, I know.

17:41.477 --> 17:42.808
That's why I'm here.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.024
I remember he was going through
a rough patch.

17:50.778 --> 17:53.566
He'd got into a fight
with your mother again...

17:55.116 --> 17:57.357
and he'd left your uncle's house

17:57.785 --> 17:58.868
and well...

17:58.869 --> 18:00.109
that's why...

18:00.580 --> 18:02.036
I took him to "La Ruta".

18:08.296 --> 18:11.539
"La Ruta" Club, 1996

18:12.300 --> 18:14.134
Now you're gonna listen
to it with reverb.

18:14.135 --> 18:16.046
You're gonna love this.

18:16.304 --> 18:17.304
Listen, listen...

18:17.305 --> 18:20.263
<i>Welcome to Radio Oskura.
The purest "destroy" music.</i>

18:20.474 --> 18:24.058
- It's cool with reverb, isn't it?
- Yeah, with reverb it's a little better.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.065
Asshole... Fuck off.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.556
You have no fucking idea.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.861
The worst idea of my life, man.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.842
That guy, the Albanian,

18:57.970 --> 18:59.802
he used to walk the girls
around "La Ruta".

18:59.972 --> 19:02.641
But, for him, it wasn't
just a club.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.802
It was a fucking shop window.

19:36.384 --> 19:37.044
Pau.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.624
Pau...
What's wrong?

19:38.761 --> 19:40.593
Why did you bring me here, Richi?

19:41.055 --> 19:42.090
Hey...

19:42.473 --> 19:43.554
Look at me!

19:43.808 --> 19:45.469
I'm not going to let you sink.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.388
Did you hear me?

19:48.104 --> 19:49.104
Okay?

20:25.975 --> 20:26.975
Hey!

20:30.730 --> 20:31.730
Hi.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.270
I saw you earlier... dancing.

20:37.945 --> 20:38.945
Do you speak Spanish?

20:39.739 --> 20:40.739
No.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.621
Are you alone?

20:48.789 --> 20:50.245
I've got my car there.

20:50.541 --> 20:53.334
If you wait for me here
I can take you home.

20:53.335 --> 20:53.824
Yeah?

20:54.295 --> 20:55.295
Hey...

20:57.757 --> 20:58.872
Do you have money?

21:30.790 --> 21:32.030
Yes, yes.

22:00.277 --> 22:03.029
And then, after that...

22:03.030 --> 22:05.112
Your father went crazy for her.

22:05.574 --> 22:08.566
He went to see her
at "Salitre" nearly every day,

22:09.078 --> 22:13.623
and then they started going out,
where anyone could see them.

22:13.624 --> 22:14.624
Fucking genius.

22:15.751 --> 22:16.957
Well, Jordi...

22:17.253 --> 22:18.743
But who was that guy?

22:20.130 --> 22:21.130
The Albanian...

22:22.132 --> 22:23.132
No one.

22:23.467 --> 22:24.467
A Pimp...

22:25.052 --> 22:27.464
who controlled them, a bit.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.391
Do you know if he was...?

22:31.392 --> 22:32.308
Seriously, Jordi...

22:32.309 --> 22:35.347
Let's stop, mate, 'cause I'm
really busy with the move, okay?

22:35.479 --> 22:37.272
I have to take care of
my dad and...

22:37.273 --> 22:40.857
Tirana's daughter was at my
uncle Felix's funeral yesterday.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.360
Vera...

22:42.778 --> 22:43.778
She's alive.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.276
You knew her too, right?

22:57.793 --> 22:59.283
Your father told me about her.

23:01.380 --> 23:05.248
Somebody told me they beat my dad
up before he disappeared.

23:07.761 --> 23:09.251
Do you know if it was that pimp?

23:15.477 --> 23:17.059
Why did he do it? Richi...

23:18.606 --> 23:19.606
Why?

23:43.380 --> 23:44.620
You came.

23:47.301 --> 23:49.292
I'll leave the menus here.

23:56.143 --> 23:58.305
Are you still not going to
tell me your name?

23:58.771 --> 24:01.934
Your real name.

24:02.358 --> 24:03.358
My name?

24:03.776 --> 24:04.776
Yes.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.111
Tirana.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.022
Sure... and I'm Bruno Lamas.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.740
A pleasure.

24:18.582 --> 24:19.947
Tirana.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.953
There's no way out, Pau.

25:45.753 --> 25:47.369
Sony“.

25:53.302 --> 25:54.463
Tirana.

25:58.599 --> 25:59.599
Tirana.

26:00.476 --> 26:01.591
Please, Tirana.

26:08.025 --> 26:09.025
Leandro! Stop, don't!

26:25.793 --> 26:26.793
Are you okay?

26:26.960 --> 26:28.576
I'm calling the police.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.128
Your father was a good
guy, Jordi.

26:40.057 --> 26:41.657
I wish you could've known
him like I did.

26:44.895 --> 26:46.226
I wish.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.559
<i>...having an impact
on social media,</i>

26:52.736 --> 26:55.774
<i>where numerous messages link
the car accident</i>

26:55.948 --> 26:58.565
<i>to the recently uncovered
urban planning...</i>

26:58.742 --> 27:01.077
<i>corruption scandal in the
“Marja!” National Park area...</i>

27:01.078 --> 27:04.580
<i>According to sources
the tragedy</i>

27:04.581 --> 27:09.085
<i>could be related to the discovery of
a tape with incriminating recordings</i>

27:09.086 --> 27:13.381
<i>in which ex-Councillor Felix Montaner's
voice can apparently be heard,</i>

27:13.382 --> 27:16.966
<i>along with people of Albanian origin

27:17.094 --> 27:18.459
<i>and money laundering, which.</i> ..

27:19.555 --> 27:20.636
Bon appétit.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.139
Do we know each other?

27:26.645 --> 27:28.556
Don't you remember me?

27:31.525 --> 27:32.525
No, sorry.

27:34.945 --> 27:36.527
German Torres.

27:38.031 --> 27:40.773
Listen... I was a friend
of your father's.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.286
But relax, okay?

27:43.287 --> 27:47.246
Of course you don't remember.
It's been a long time and...

27:48.375 --> 27:49.458
You were...

27:49.459 --> 27:51.245
You were only this big.

27:52.963 --> 27:54.249
Yeah...

27:56.091 --> 27:58.048
How's life'?
How are you getting on?

27:58.260 --> 27:59.260
Good, good.

28:01.054 --> 28:02.135
Do you have a girlfriend?

28:02.598 --> 28:03.133
No.

28:03.307 --> 28:04.968
Better that way. Less problems.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.308
I'm married... I have...

28:08.812 --> 28:10.771
I have two kids,
a boy and a girl...

28:10.772 --> 28:11.933
Hey, excuse me...

28:12.733 --> 28:13.853
What the hell are you doing?

28:14.735 --> 28:17.022
It's the hospital food, it
doesn't taste of anything.

28:23.118 --> 28:25.780
What was Pau's son doing at
Richi's house this morning?

28:26.747 --> 28:27.955
What the fuck is this about?

28:27.956 --> 28:30.573
Calm down, I just want to help.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.576
They can really hurt
you, you know?

28:34.296 --> 28:35.582
What?

28:42.054 --> 28:44.261
For God's sake, Diego!
Wait, please!

28:46.808 --> 28:48.309
They're going to lie
about your family.

28:48.310 --> 28:49.810
They'll say whatever they have to
to destroy you.

28:49.811 --> 28:52.269
They'll fake the evidence
if they have to.

28:53.106 --> 28:54.562
Look, take this.

28:55.234 --> 28:59.102
I'll give you my card.
Take it, Diego.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.564
If you need anything call
me, okay?

29:03.867 --> 29:05.528
Hey...

29:12.376 --> 29:14.959
Torres Foundation
Sports Complex - German Torres

29:20.092 --> 29:21.582
What's up, cousin?
Missing me already?

29:23.637 --> 29:24.968
Everything okay?

29:25.597 --> 29:26.555
I don't know.

29:26.556 --> 29:28.638
I've just run into a guy who
was really on edge

29:28.767 --> 29:30.553
who says he was a
friend of my father.

29:31.395 --> 29:33.762
He asked me what you were doing
earlier at Richi's house.

29:41.571 --> 29:42.571
Jordi?

29:44.616 --> 29:45.731
Jordi?

30:24.531 --> 30:25.531
Good afternoon.

30:27.075 --> 30:29.942
We're looking for
a <i>Mr...</i> German Torres.

30:40.130 --> 30:41.370
Torres!

30:43.633 --> 30:44.748
Mr. Torres!

30:51.099 --> 30:52.099
Give me a minute.

30:52.601 --> 30:53.887
I'll be back in a second.

30:55.103 --> 30:56.764
They're are asking for you.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.024
Good afternoon.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.025
Hello.

31:03.945 --> 31:05.231
Do you know who I am?

31:05.572 --> 31:07.233
Yes, more or less. You...

31:07.866 --> 31:09.777
You're Pau Montaner's son, right?

31:09.951 --> 31:10.951
Yes.

31:11.078 --> 31:12.739
Pau Montaner's son...

31:17.542 --> 31:19.543
That's all, Vicent.

31:19.544 --> 31:20.544
Thank you.

31:20.796 --> 31:23.959
I love that young people come here
to train. It keeps the club alive.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.132
Have you ever played “Pilota"?

31:27.636 --> 31:29.468
You knew my father, right'?

31:31.973 --> 31:32.973
No.

31:33.809 --> 31:35.299
Not really, no.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.181
I met him a couple of times.

31:38.772 --> 31:40.763
And did Felix ever tell
you where my dad went?

31:42.359 --> 31:43.526
Sorry?

31:43.527 --> 31:45.027
No... of course...

31:45.028 --> 31:48.066
People, here in the village,
said he had gone somewhere and...

31:48.240 --> 31:51.073
maybe as you're a friend
of Félix, he told you...

31:51.243 --> 31:52.243
No, no.

31:54.788 --> 31:57.246
Well, he did mention
something, yeah.

31:57.874 --> 32:00.536
He told me that he was leaving
for France with his girlfriend.

32:00.669 --> 32:01.329
I don't know.

32:01.461 --> 32:04.544
France. Yes, I heard that too.

32:05.048 --> 32:06.288
And...

32:06.883 --> 32:11.343
maybe he received a letter, a
postcard from France or something...

32:11.471 --> 32:12.802
Kid,

32:13.140 --> 32:16.258
I can't even remember what I ate
yesterday, you know?

32:17.269 --> 32:19.931
Well, I have to go,
they're waiting for me.

32:21.606 --> 32:22.606
Jordi!

32:23.608 --> 32:25.889
If you don't tell me what you
fucking know about my father

32:26.027 --> 32:29.361
and why the fuck you're following me,
I'm going to report you for harassment.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.034
It's okay.

32:36.371 --> 32:39.081
I saw your cousin by chance
on my way here to the club.

32:39.082 --> 32:41.843
And if I've offered you my help it's
only because I feel really bad...

32:41.960 --> 32:44.122
about what's happened
to your parents.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.253
It's shit!

32:48.091 --> 32:50.048
I'm really sorry.

32:52.762 --> 32:54.594
Could you take him away, please?

32:55.557 --> 32:56.557
Jordi!

32:57.767 --> 33:00.054
Stop!
What the hell are you doing?

33:00.479 --> 33:01.844
Come on! Let's play!

33:05.775 --> 33:07.615
- What a son of a bitch!
- Why did you do that?

33:07.736 --> 33:08.271
What?

33:08.445 --> 33:10.529
You threatened him in front
of everybody! Fuck!

33:10.530 --> 33:12.031
- He was lying.
- What the fuck are you doing?

33:12.032 --> 33:14.952
Where does he know me from? He's never
seen me before in his fucking life.

33:18.538 --> 33:20.956
Can you remember how to get to
this place? "The Salitre" club.

33:20.957 --> 33:21.790
What are you saying?

33:21.791 --> 33:23.577
- "The Salitre" club.
- Watch the road.

33:24.961 --> 33:26.128
Watch the road!

33:26.129 --> 33:28.130
"The Salitre", that whorehouse
where my dad used to go.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.088
- Stop the car.
- Can you help me with this...?

33:30.258 --> 33:31.258
Stop the car!

33:39.643 --> 33:40.643
Diego!

33:45.357 --> 33:46.357
Great!

33:48.360 --> 33:49.360
Diego!

33:51.947 --> 33:52.947
Diego!

33:54.741 --> 33:55.741
Come on, Diego...

33:57.285 --> 33:58.285
Wait a second.

33:58.745 --> 33:59.745
Stop.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.622
Stop, Diego.

34:01.623 --> 34:02.784
Why did you come back?

34:02.958 --> 34:04.291
To stir up all this shit?

34:04.292 --> 34:05.292
Hey...

34:05.794 --> 34:07.034
Nothing's happened.

34:15.053 --> 34:18.136
I was stuck there with the Opus
priests for years.

34:20.100 --> 34:22.101
My mother said she did it
for my education,

34:22.101 --> 34:24.935
but what she really wanted was
to keep me away from all this.

34:28.233 --> 34:29.563
I spoke to her,

34:30.735 --> 34:33.944
I told her everything
my father had done,

34:35.364 --> 34:37.777
she listened to me and never
wanted to speak about it again.

34:40.286 --> 34:41.618
And what did you do?

34:43.456 --> 34:44.456
Nothing...

34:46.543 --> 34:47.623
Put up with it...

34:48.753 --> 34:51.620
and then left the boarding
school when I turned 18.

34:56.303 --> 34:57.583
And what was it your father did?

34:58.763 --> 35:00.800
Nothing. Doesn't matter...

35:01.099 --> 35:02.464
He's dead now...

35:08.231 --> 35:10.768
Look...
Félix was really nice to us.

35:11.776 --> 35:15.610
Since my old man left...

35:16.239 --> 35:18.532
He helped us,
sending money every time we...

35:18.533 --> 35:21.571
Yeah... that was his style.

35:22.037 --> 35:25.246
It's been a long time, why don't
you speak to her?

35:26.124 --> 35:27.956
Speak about what?

35:28.126 --> 35:29.537
About why they abandoned me?

35:30.045 --> 35:32.878
Look, my mother has always
protected my father, all her life.

35:33.173 --> 35:35.341
And now, if she recovers, she'll
probably get away without even

35:35.342 --> 35:37.702
having to do time in a fucking
VIP prison cell in Picassent.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.884
I don't want to speak to her
because...

35:43.558 --> 35:45.765
I just don't fucking want to.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.769
You're out of your head, man.

35:52.275 --> 35:53.915
The truth doesn't
change anything, cousin.

35:55.111 --> 35:56.601
What's that?
Miguel Hernandez too?

35:57.030 --> 35:58.030
No...

35:58.782 --> 36:00.272
Berlusconi!

36:23.473 --> 36:24.473
There it is.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.233
Shall we have a drink?

37:04.597 --> 37:05.556
Hello?

37:05.557 --> 37:06.557
What's up, Richi?

37:06.975 --> 37:08.100
I need a favour.

37:08.101 --> 37:09.808
<i>Hey, who gave you my number?</i>

37:11.938 --> 37:14.273
By any chance, do you know of...

37:14.274 --> 37:17.016
a whorehouse around here where I
can find Eastern European women?

37:19.863 --> 37:20.863
Richi?

37:26.077 --> 37:27.077
Wow...

37:38.465 --> 37:39.585
I'm going to the toilet!
Okay

37:48.641 --> 37:49.972
What can I get you, handsome?

37:50.310 --> 37:51.800
A beer, please.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.240
Excuse me,

38:07.118 --> 38:09.280
can I ask you a kind of...

38:09.454 --> 38:10.454
weird question?

38:14.042 --> 38:15.532
Hey, Blondie!

38:15.960 --> 38:17.792
Leave something on the plate.

38:26.763 --> 38:28.083
You don't come here often, right?

38:29.140 --> 38:30.140
Not really, no.

38:33.102 --> 38:34.137
My name is Nahid.

38:34.771 --> 38:36.432
I don't have any change.

38:36.564 --> 38:38.271
Well... it doesn't matter.

38:46.533 --> 38:47.533
Excuse me,

38:48.284 --> 38:49.284
where are you from?

38:49.744 --> 38:50.859
Pakistan.

38:53.748 --> 38:56.035
Do you know if I can find any
Albanian girls here?

38:59.963 --> 39:03.090
No, I don't...

39:03.091 --> 39:05.253
Have you worked here
for a long time?

39:06.135 --> 39:07.967
Quite a while.

39:09.055 --> 39:13.392
Do you know anybody who worked in a
club called “El Salitre" by any chance?

39:13.393 --> 39:15.885
- Are you a cop?
- No, no.

39:21.734 --> 39:23.270
Nahid,

39:23.862 --> 39:27.776
I need to find a woman that
worked at that club 20 years ago.

39:27.949 --> 39:28.949
She was from Albania.

39:32.537 --> 39:35.245
You have a tired
look in your eyes.

39:35.582 --> 39:37.118
I am tired.

39:37.250 --> 39:40.038
Come up with me to the rooms.

39:41.296 --> 39:43.037
You have to forget.

39:44.299 --> 39:45.881
Her name was Tirana.

39:47.552 --> 39:48.552
Don't you like me?

39:51.389 --> 39:54.256
We can come together.

39:55.768 --> 39:57.054
Good evening.

39:58.354 --> 39:59.560
Everything okay?

39:59.856 --> 40:00.564
Yes,

40:00.565 --> 40:03.523
everything's okay. We're talking.
Thank you, we don't need anything.

40:03.735 --> 40:04.735
Leave.

40:12.535 --> 40:13.741
Take him outside.

40:15.079 --> 40:16.371
I'll finish my beer and I'll...

40:16.372 --> 40:18.033
No, relax!
Stop, stop, stop!

40:19.584 --> 40:20.949
I'm gonna grab my beer...

40:21.127 --> 40:22.127
and I'll leave.

40:22.795 --> 40:24.251
Tell the dog to relax.

40:50.073 --> 40:52.360
<i>- Where are you, man?
- Outside, they kicked me out.</i>

40:52.533 --> 40:53.867
- Out of the parking area!
- Relax!

40:53.868 --> 40:56.451
- Get out of here!
- I'm going! I'm going!

40:56.746 --> 40:57.746
<i>Leave now!</i>

40:59.791 --> 41:01.247
- It's a free country...
- Asshole!

41:01.751 --> 41:02.751
Come on!

41:03.044 --> 41:05.724
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Get your own fucking self out of here!

41:08.800 --> 41:09.961
Cousin, you're right.

41:11.594 --> 41:12.379
Let's go and rest.

41:12.553 --> 41:13.553
Stop. Listen!

41:15.556 --> 41:17.092
I have someone who can help us.

41:25.942 --> 41:27.228
I want it to be clear.

41:27.610 --> 41:30.102
I don't give a fuck about what
they did to your father.

41:31.114 --> 41:32.275
I'm just here for Vera.

41:35.743 --> 41:37.577
Is it true she's still alive?

41:37.578 --> 41:38.578
Yes.

41:38.746 --> 41:41.784
You lived with Tirana
in the "treehouse”, right?

41:45.044 --> 41:47.376
I used to stay with Vera
when her mother went out.

41:49.132 --> 41:50.132
I took care of her.

41:51.050 --> 41:53.963
When I arrived in Spain they
kept me locked up for three days

41:54.137 --> 41:55.548
in a basement with no food.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.090
They called it "the submarine".

42:03.354 --> 42:05.105
I told them I'd tell
the police but...

42:05.106 --> 42:09.441
then they showed me photos of my
mother shopping at the market.

42:11.571 --> 42:13.530
That's what they did
at the beginning.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.442
Later on they protected you...

42:18.119 --> 42:22.238
They even made you believe
they were your new family.

42:25.543 --> 42:28.285
Do you know if the man
that hurt you...

42:29.255 --> 42:31.587
was the same one that
beat up my father?

42:31.966 --> 42:33.752
I said no names.

42:37.472 --> 42:39.088
How did you meet my father?

42:50.026 --> 42:51.733
Pau! Pau!

42:59.243 --> 43:01.075
I'm going to tell
them everything.

43:01.370 --> 43:02.370
You wouldn't dare.

43:03.873 --> 43:04.873
Everything.

43:06.584 --> 43:07.584
Are you okay?

43:14.300 --> 43:15.300
Yeah.

43:17.261 --> 43:19.798
Don't worry, I'm fine.

43:24.644 --> 43:26.760
It's over there.
Park at the back.

43:45.123 --> 43:46.739
You're crazy!

43:47.125 --> 43:49.241
Why have you brought him here?

43:52.296 --> 43:53.582
What the fuck are you doing?

44:27.456 --> 44:28.946
Who is he?

44:31.043 --> 44:32.043
Are you okay?

44:34.755 --> 44:36.871
<i>That night he met Vera.</i>

44:37.258 --> 44:41.126
<i>The girl had been here about six
months but nobody knew.</i>

44:41.596 --> 44:43.303
Only Leandro and us.

44:44.974 --> 44:46.135
Leandro? Who's Leandro?

44:48.728 --> 44:51.311
Do you think those people would
let them get out of here alive?

44:52.064 --> 44:53.554
It's impossible.

44:54.609 --> 44:56.566
And where are they buried?

44:59.447 --> 45:02.064
Can you at least tell me where
I can find that guy, Leandro?

45:05.286 --> 45:06.286
Stop.

45:07.872 --> 45:09.237
Wait.

45:10.249 --> 45:11.249
Wait!

45:12.460 --> 45:15.043
Wait! Wait, please! Stop!

45:34.315 --> 45:36.431
They called Leandro
"the Albanian".

45:37.610 --> 45:38.650
He was always watching us.

46:17.525 --> 46:21.018
After that night, someone
snitched and...

46:21.612 --> 46:25.651
said the Albanian was working
separately with Tirana.

46:27.243 --> 46:28.529
First they went for Vera...

46:32.748 --> 46:34.330
then for him.

46:42.550 --> 46:43.756
Get up!

46:47.555 --> 46:48.841
Leave him.

46:48.973 --> 46:50.338
Don't move, you fucking dog!

46:55.938 --> 46:59.306
I swear it's true.
I didn't know about her daughter.

47:01.152 --> 47:03.018
Forgive me!

47:03.738 --> 47:05.228
Vincent!

47:06.741 --> 47:07.822
Don't leave me here!

47:09.410 --> 47:11.242
It's my aunt. Sorry.

47:16.542 --> 47:17.828
And what happened to him?

47:18.836 --> 47:19.836
Is he alive?

47:20.254 --> 47:21.421
Leandro? No idea.

47:21.422 --> 47:22.339
Hey. What happened?

47:22.340 --> 47:24.547
Will you call me
if you find Vera?

47:25.634 --> 47:26.965
Of course.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.556
- But... When did it happen?
- <i>Just</i> now. <i>I've</i> been <i>calling you.</i>

47:31.557 --> 47:33.058
<i>I was alone in the room.</i>

47:33.059 --> 47:34.267
Did you see anyone?

47:34.268 --> 47:37.520
<i>No. Your aunt and uncle had left.
I was alone when it happened.</i>

47:37.521 --> 47:38.226
<i>I need you to come</i> here.

47:38.397 --> 47:40.513
Okay, I'm on my way.

48:00.336 --> 48:01.542
Jordi...

48:03.422 --> 48:06.414
I think they've tried to
kill my mother.

48:13.349 --> 48:15.181
I'll park the car and find you.

48:45.756 --> 48:47.042
They're checking the CCTV.

48:47.383 --> 48:49.259
We think somebody went in
your aunt Dora's room

48:49.260 --> 48:50.635
and took out the breathing tube.

48:50.636 --> 48:51.671
Jordi!

48:53.347 --> 48:55.839
Do you know if Diego had
been threatened?

48:57.643 --> 48:59.634
How do you know he was kidnapped?

49:00.438 --> 49:02.304
Several witnesses saw it.

49:05.526 --> 49:08.109
Mr Antonio Guzman,
your uncle Félix's lawyer,

49:08.237 --> 49:10.905
was found suffocated this
morning in his office.

49:10.906 --> 49:13.616
No prints.
They haven't found anything.

49:13.617 --> 49:14.948
Suffocated?

49:22.626 --> 49:23.832
I haven't...

49:23.961 --> 49:26.043
I haven't slept for a long time,
you know?

49:27.131 --> 49:29.463
There's a coffee
machine in there,

49:30.259 --> 49:32.626
do you mind if I get one?

50:09.173 --> 50:10.334
Do you want anything to eat?

50:11.425 --> 50:12.460
Are you hungry?

50:15.971 --> 50:18.258
- What the fuck is this?
- It's nearly dawn.

50:19.558 --> 50:21.048
What have you given me?

50:27.107 --> 50:28.107
Here.

50:29.818 --> 50:30.318
Drink.

50:30.319 --> 50:31.319
Let me go.

50:31.946 --> 50:33.653
- Drink.
- Let me go!

50:38.244 --> 50:39.244
Wake up, come on.

50:41.539 --> 50:42.539
Wake up.

50:43.457 --> 50:44.457
Look at me.

50:44.833 --> 50:47.040
- Diego, look at me, please!
- What are you doing?

50:48.045 --> 50:51.037
If I don't get those tapes
they'll kill my kids. Understand?

50:51.465 --> 50:53.456
They're going to hurt my family.

50:56.262 --> 50:58.054
Your mother is going down
like everyone else...

50:58.055 --> 51:01.173
so there's no point trying
to protect her.

51:01.642 --> 51:02.848
And your father...

51:05.437 --> 51:08.020
the fucking idiot...

51:10.317 --> 51:12.809
recorded those tapes
to get an advantage...

51:18.409 --> 51:21.026
and now those same tapes have
incriminated him.

51:21.954 --> 51:24.036
For fuck's sake!

51:24.748 --> 51:26.159
Did you kill my father?

51:30.838 --> 51:31.953
Don't you dare say that.

51:33.757 --> 51:34.797
Son of a bitch, let me go!

51:35.259 --> 51:36.545
Your father...

51:40.764 --> 51:42.550
I really respected him.

51:47.146 --> 51:48.307
Diego, where are the tapes?

51:50.733 --> 51:52.599
Tell me, Richi.

51:56.947 --> 52:00.617
A few weeks ago I got a
call from my uncle.

52:00.618 --> 52:02.404
Stop! Stop!

52:04.413 --> 52:06.120
They were going to make
the canal bigger...

52:06.624 --> 52:09.616
and they wanted to demolish
the old barn.

52:17.760 --> 52:22.254
<i>They found my van. The one Pau
took when they disappeared.</i>

52:23.766 --> 52:26.349
<i>Their bags had been there
for 20 years.</i>

52:27.645 --> 52:28.645
<i>And?</i>

52:29.021 --> 52:31.308
When I got back here,

52:31.440 --> 52:32.601
back <i>home...</i>

52:34.818 --> 52:36.611
I opened your father's bag...

52:36.612 --> 52:37.612
And?

52:38.238 --> 52:39.945
There was...

52:40.532 --> 52:42.148
There was a cassette inside.

52:43.952 --> 52:45.818
There was a tape inside.

52:49.750 --> 52:51.036
- I sold it.
- Richi!

52:51.168 --> 52:52.624
I don't have anything left.

52:52.920 --> 52:53.920
Richi!

52:54.171 --> 52:55.171
Look at me!

53:08.560 --> 53:09.560
It's a fake.

53:10.187 --> 53:11.187
It's a...

53:12.731 --> 53:13.436
It's a replica.

53:13.607 --> 53:15.939
You'll only make us both cry.

53:22.658 --> 53:23.658
Forgive me.

53:25.911 --> 53:29.029
I have no fucking idea what
you're talking about.

53:30.124 --> 53:32.240
Let me go! Hey!

53:32.543 --> 53:33.624
Let me go!

53:38.173 --> 53:39.538
Listen to me, Diego.

53:40.634 --> 53:41.634
Listen to me.

53:41.969 --> 53:43.845
The press has one of those tapes.

53:43.846 --> 53:46.848
The rest of them were hidden by your
father somewhere, I don't know where.

53:46.849 --> 53:49.261
I don't know where the
fucking tapes are...

53:49.852 --> 53:51.138
What the fuck are you doing?

53:51.270 --> 53:53.307
Are you crazy?

54:10.831 --> 54:12.822
Where are they, Diego...
the tapes?

54:15.836 --> 54:17.668
Diego, I need the tapes.

54:19.173 --> 54:20.254
Diego.

54:20.841 --> 54:23.959
Diego! Look at me! Look at me!

54:24.470 --> 54:26.757
Diego, look at me!

54:28.640 --> 54:29.755
Look at me!

54:30.350 --> 54:32.136
Look at me! Look at me!

54:33.145 --> 54:34.604
What year did you
leave the village?

54:34.605 --> 54:35.605
Do you remember?

54:35.606 --> 54:36.314
I don't know.

54:36.315 --> 54:37.899
What year did you
leave the village?

54:37.900 --> 54:39.015
I can't remember.

54:39.151 --> 54:40.516
I swear I can't remember.

54:40.652 --> 54:42.609
Diego, what year did you
leave the village?

54:44.531 --> 54:45.531
How old were you?

54:45.532 --> 54:47.742
I don't know... 14... 15.

54:47.743 --> 54:49.827
Very good. Look at me.

54:49.828 --> 54:51.819
14... 15... very good.

54:56.043 --> 54:57.533
Let me go.

54:59.171 --> 55:01.754
Let me go, please.

55:08.639 --> 55:09.555
Stop.

55:09.556 --> 55:11.057
No, no, no...

55:11.058 --> 55:11.974
No, no...

55:11.975 --> 55:13.261
Diego, listen to me!

55:15.437 --> 55:17.644
It was autumn, 1996.

55:17.815 --> 55:19.726
The same year your father
recorded those tapes.

55:24.738 --> 55:25.738
Continue.

55:27.324 --> 55:28.825
There was a voice recorder...

55:28.826 --> 55:30.117
in my dad's study.

55:30.118 --> 55:30.743
What?

55:30.744 --> 55:33.037
There was a voice recorder
in my dad's study.

55:33.038 --> 55:33.621
Where?

55:33.622 --> 55:35.331
In... in a drawer in his desk.

55:35.332 --> 55:36.332
Look at me, Diego. Where?

55:36.667 --> 55:38.249
- Where?
- I don't know!

55:38.460 --> 55:39.544
- Where did you see it?
- I don't know!

55:39.545 --> 55:40.626
In a desk, where?

55:40.963 --> 55:43.546
- At my parents' house, but...
- Where?

55:44.424 --> 55:45.630
In a fucking drawer in the...

55:45.759 --> 55:47.260
- Where?
- I swear I don't know.

55:47.261 --> 55:50.049
- Where are the rest of the tapes?
- I swear I don't know.

55:50.180 --> 55:51.848
Diego, where? Remember!

55:51.849 --> 55:52.640
Stop!

55:52.641 --> 55:55.349
No! I don't know! Stop!
No, stop, stop, please!

55:55.477 --> 55:56.561
Where are the tapes?

55:56.562 --> 55:57.723
I swear I don't know!

56:03.610 --> 56:05.521
Son of a bitch!

56:16.039 --> 56:17.039
Can you give me a ciggy?

56:33.974 --> 56:38.764
They've kidnapped Diego. I need you
to tell me who did that to you...

56:40.314 --> 56:41.600
Please.

56:44.026 --> 56:46.233
It was that guy
from the "Pilota" club.

56:46.945 --> 56:49.812
<i>Felix's friend.
He was here last week.</i>

56:55.829 --> 56:57.536
How much did they pay
you for the tape?

56:57.664 --> 56:58.664
Look at me!

56:59.750 --> 57:00.750
Look at me!

57:07.049 --> 57:08.915
Thirty thousand.

57:11.053 --> 57:13.636
Thirty thousand... A journalist.

57:17.684 --> 57:19.143
No, no...

57:19.144 --> 57:21.306
Tell him, Vincent.

57:26.526 --> 57:29.393
No, no, no...

57:33.116 --> 57:35.107
No! Leave him!
Leave my father alone!

57:35.243 --> 57:36.118
Please! Stop!

57:36.119 --> 57:37.951
Stop! Stop! Stop!

57:38.121 --> 57:40.158
Stop. Please!

57:40.540 --> 57:42.326
Stop, I swear to God
I don't know anything...

57:42.459 --> 57:43.459
Shut up! Shut up!

57:43.460 --> 57:46.828
I swear to God that I don't
know if there are more tapes.

57:46.964 --> 57:49.046
Stop, stop, stop...!

57:52.636 --> 57:53.671
Is that it?

57:54.554 --> 57:56.764
If you're going to kill a man and
he doesn't tell you the truth,

57:56.765 --> 57:58.347
it means he doesn't
know the truth.

57:58.976 --> 58:00.182
Never forget that.

58:04.022 --> 58:05.103
A little more.

58:10.320 --> 58:11.526
I only listened to one tape.

58:11.655 --> 58:12.738
Good.

58:12.739 --> 58:14.323
...and I didn't
understand anything.

58:14.324 --> 58:15.324
Good.

58:15.617 --> 58:18.536
My father spoke about money
with another man...

58:18.537 --> 58:20.830
and of some land in "The Marjal".

58:20.831 --> 58:21.831
Good.

58:21.832 --> 58:25.543
I told my mother and they sent me
to the boarding school...

58:25.544 --> 58:28.536
and I haven't been back
here since then' I swear.

58:29.464 --> 58:30.750
Good boy. Good boy.

58:34.553 --> 58:36.137
But why did you
lie to me earlier?

58:36.138 --> 58:38.049
I burned all your
father's stuff...

58:40.976 --> 58:42.262
Except for this.

58:46.815 --> 58:49.227
He would have loved you
to listen to it.

58:51.528 --> 58:52.939
Leave now, please.

58:57.242 --> 58:58.528
Give me that.

59:01.747 --> 59:03.613
Back away!

59:06.668 --> 59:07.668
Get in!

59:08.253 --> 59:09.539
Get inside!

59:20.182 --> 59:21.923
Son of a bitch!

59:27.606 --> 59:29.222
Leave me alone!

59:57.844 --> 59:58.844
Vincent?

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:20.322
Son of a...

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:42.636
Good evening.

01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:44.849
Yes.

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:47.059
Yes, it's me, sorry...
It went off by mistake.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.060
Help!

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:52.606
<i>Diego!</i>

01:00:54.025 --> 01:00:55.607
- Diego
- Jordi!

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:57.439
<i>Shut up!</i>

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:00.614
Jordi!

01:01:00.615 --> 01:01:01.615
Shut up!

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:52.744
I'm going to kill you!

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:56.243
You motherfucker!

01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:28.446
My head hurts.

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.952
Take me to the hospital, please.
I can't take it anymore.

01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:32.946
My head's going to explode.

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:37.455
They're going to take you
to any hospital you want.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:41.747
You haven't called the
police, right?

01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:45.050
You're not so stupid that you
called the police, right?

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:50.766
My head hurts.

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:51.767
Please...

01:02:52.477 --> 01:02:54.809
I played "Pilota"
when I was a kid, too.

01:02:55.647 --> 01:02:57.934
Now I can't remember how you even
fucking hit the ball.

01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:02.319
It's a matter of practice, right?

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.320
Hey!

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:06.442
It's all a matter of practice.

01:03:07.242 --> 01:03:08.323
Listen to me.

01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:12.621
I have a lot of money,
I have plenty of money...

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:13.953
in the safe.

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:17.042
We can come to an agreement,
the three of us.

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:17.960
Do you want to make a deal?

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:20.629
- Let's make a deal.
- Let's make a deal. Come on.

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:21.630
Let's make a deal.

01:03:22.048 --> 01:03:23.664
You tell me where my father is...

01:03:24.551 --> 01:03:25.837
and I won't kill you.

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:29.336
- Do you like that deal?
- Jordi, you need to help me.

01:03:29.764 --> 01:03:32.472
I'm begging you.
You have to help me.

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:36.597
They're going to kill my kids.
Help me Jordi, please.

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:37.811
Please.

01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:41.515
My dad disappeared 20 years ago
with a woman and her daughter...

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:44.320
And you are going to tell me
what the fuck they did to them...

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:47.406
You are going to tell me what the
fuck they did to them...

01:03:47.407 --> 01:03:47.906
Jordi!

01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:49.908
I don't know what
they did to them.

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:51.160
I'll kill you, son of a bitch!

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:52.536
I'll kill you!

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:53.026
Jordi!

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:56.030
Look for Leandro!
At "La Ruta".

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:58.751
He lives there, in the commune.
Look for him!

01:03:58.752 --> 01:04:00.544
- Leandro?
- Leandro! Look for him!

01:04:00.545 --> 01:04:02.463
- The Albanian?
- He's the only one... yes.

01:04:02.464 --> 01:04:03.750
He's the only one...

01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:06.753
the only one who could know
something about the Albanian girls.

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:10.965
Don't do it, Jordi.
I beg you, please.

01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:26.943
The Albanian.

01:04:27.238 --> 01:04:28.820
At "La Ruta".

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:30.234
Let's go.

01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:37.537
Jordi wait. Let me go, please.

01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:39.247
Hey... Hey...

01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:42.538
Hey...

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:44.623
Don't leave...

01:04:44.756 --> 01:04:46.918
Get me out of this, please...

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:48.749
Hey!

01:04:50.762 --> 01:04:53.430
Get me out of this.

01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:54.466
For God's sake...

01:04:54.641 --> 01:04:57.053
Get me out of this. Hey!

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:06.228
Hey. Siri!

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:07.611
<i>I'm listening.</i>

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:09.023
Good...

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:10.322
Good...

01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:11.946
Hey. Siri!

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:14.111
Call Vincent.

01:05:15.662 --> 01:05:17.329
<i>Which Vicent? Vicent...</i>

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:17.830
No.

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:19.331
<i>- Vicent Palmero...
- No, no.</i>

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:20.457
<i>- Vicent Quilez.
- No.</i>

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:22.540
<i>- Vicent "Pilota"...
- No.</i>

01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:24.461
Vincent. Vincent!

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:26.169
Call Vincent!

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.258
<i>Which Vicente? You have 17.</i>

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:31.051
No. For God's sake.

01:05:31.052 --> 01:05:34.054
Vincent with an for fuck's sake.

01:05:34.055 --> 01:05:36.056
<i>I would never speak to you
like that.</i>

01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:37.468
For fuck's sake!

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:38.767
Put me down.

01:05:41.729 --> 01:05:42.810
Fuck...

01:05:49.154 --> 01:05:50.610
Son of a bitch.

01:05:54.534 --> 01:05:56.241
Where are you going with that?

01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:00.950
Son of a bitch.

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:02.156
Son of a bitch.

01:06:02.333 --> 01:06:03.949
It fucking hurts.

01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:18.922
Fucking hell...

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:26.146
You have to write a book
about all this.

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:28.724
I will.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.322
- Shall I leave you to deal with them?
- Uh?

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:47.336
Take care of yourself.

01:06:47.462 --> 01:06:48.629
Where are you going?

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:52.123
Jordi, no! Fuck...
Jordi, stop!

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:53.228
Hello?
Anyone there?

01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:00.611
Hi.

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:03.656
I'm looking for a man called Leandro.
They call him the Alban...

01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:07.117
No, wait!

01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:09.161
Please!

01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:13.046
Great...

01:08:13.548 --> 01:08:14.834
Good morning.

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:17.050
There's someone here who wants
to speak to his mother.

01:08:17.051 --> 01:08:18.917
Leave us alone, please,
and close the door.

01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:22.848
Thank you.

01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:28.895
You have to help us, Diego.

01:08:28.895 --> 01:08:30.814
The prosecution have asked us
accept civil liability for damages.

01:08:30.814 --> 01:08:31.814
They're coming for us.

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:57.600
October 9th, 1996

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:10.654
You got a light or what?

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:23.719
How did it go with Mr. Guzman?

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.722
He said we're opening in
Montevideo in a years' time max.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:27.723
Good...

01:10:27.849 --> 01:10:28.932
That's what I like to hear.

01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:30.844
You do whatever he says, okay?

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:34.302
Look, look.

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:43.196
The queen of the dance floor,
isn't she?

01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:44.757
The queen of the dance floor,
you pussy?

01:10:46.117 --> 01:10:48.700
That's why you married
her, isn't it?

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:55.823
What's up?

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:58.420
What,
what the fuck is up with you?

01:10:58.421 --> 01:10:59.707
Félix...

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:04.541
I prefer her not to mess so much
with our business.

01:11:04.844 --> 01:11:05.925
Okay?

01:11:06.846 --> 01:11:10.714
I think it's great that you trust
her... she's your wife and...

01:11:11.726 --> 01:11:16.605
But our business is our
business. Is that clear?

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:17.926
- Don't be so dramatic.
- Félix...

01:11:18.608 --> 01:11:19.691
I only told her that...

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:22.684
Félix... It's okay.
Everything's fine.

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:26.814
Asshole.

01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:30.400
A drink?

01:11:30.536 --> 01:11:31.401
Wait, wait.

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:33.027
What do you want?

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.122
We've got problems
with my brother.

01:11:36.834 --> 01:11:38.825
He doesn't want to sign.

01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:47.417
Félix,

01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:49.214
can we speak for a moment?

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:51.137
- Now?
- Yeah.

01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:53.218
I have to take the
kid to school...

01:11:55.436 --> 01:11:57.598
I don't want to sell mum
and dad's country house.

01:11:57.772 --> 01:12:00.013
I'm not going to sign
"The Marjal" thing.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:04.820
Close the door.

01:12:13.412 --> 01:12:14.412
Pau.

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:17.206
Mr. Guzman is already writing up
all the documents.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:19.040
I'm going to renovate it.

01:12:19.418 --> 01:12:21.329
I'll pay your part of the house.

01:12:21.546 --> 01:12:23.036
And you're gonna live...

01:12:23.214 --> 01:12:25.125
there, in the countryside?

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:28.838
Are you going to take care
of the rice too?

01:12:29.554 --> 01:12:30.554
I'd be good at it.

01:12:31.138 --> 01:12:33.049
You'd be fucking great at it.

01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:36.721
As you've grown... so much rice
there, in Buenos Aires.

01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:39.598
Why are you
in such a hurry to sell it?

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:46.192
Go back home with your family.

01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:48.611
Are you kicking me out'?

01:12:54.328 --> 01:12:56.820
You can still fix things
with Martina...

01:12:57.123 --> 01:12:59.332
And while you're at it, stop
fucking up your son's life.

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:01.540
I'm not going to sign!
Are we clear?

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:04.713
I'm not going to sign.

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.052
Hey! Relax. It's okay.

01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:17.223
He'll forget about it.

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:22.397
Félix.

01:13:25.192 --> 01:13:26.808
...pussy.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:29.310
Come on!

01:13:42.627 --> 01:13:44.334
Back then we could
never have imagined

01:13:44.503 --> 01:13:46.619
the huge mess that
situation would lead to.

01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:51.041
Go on, please.

01:13:53.137 --> 01:13:57.347
I'm going to sign the sale of the
land. You can trust me on that...

01:13:57.934 --> 01:14:00.551
but I want the money now.

01:14:01.062 --> 01:14:02.097
Okay.

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:06.024
But only...

01:14:06.025 --> 01:14:08.608
...if you go far away.

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:11.110
Out of the country...

01:14:12.907 --> 01:14:14.523
and no questions asked.

01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:17.196
Thank you.

01:14:20.331 --> 01:14:22.914
I'll wait for you tomorrow,
at the country house...

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:25.537
but come alone.

01:14:28.923 --> 01:14:31.130
You must love her very much
to be willing to...

01:14:32.843 --> 01:14:34.129
Félix.

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:45.395
Is he staying the night?

01:14:47.191 --> 01:14:48.306
What do you want, Dora?

01:14:49.527 --> 01:14:50.813
<i>What happened to him?</i>

01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:56.408
<i>If he wants to stay the night,
he'll stay.</i>

01:14:56.409 --> 01:14:58.410
<i>Félix, we've already
spoken about this...</i>

01:14:58.411 --> 01:15:00.698
<i>I don't want him staying</i> here.

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:03.913
<i>Your brother only
brings trouble...</i>

01:15:09.714 --> 01:15:11.830
Pau took the voice recorder?

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:15.128
We think so, yes.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.130
What for?

01:15:21.434 --> 01:15:22.640
No idea.

01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:27.096
But last week somebody leaked a
tape that ended up in the press.

01:15:29.025 --> 01:15:31.026
Mr. Guzman says it was that
friend Pau had...

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:33.314
The chicken guy.

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:44.822
<i>I've been talking
to the urban planning officer</i>

01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:46.205
that you introduced to me.

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:47.333
And?

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:51.203
He's asked for a 500 million
commission.

01:15:51.839 --> 01:15:53.631
<i>If they paid,
the territorial commission</i>

01:15:53.632 --> 01:15:57.635
<i>would grant the land
urban planning status,</i>

01:15:57.636 --> 01:15:59.054
<i>and pay off the landowners
in the surrounding area.</i>

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:02.932
<i>Everything was thought
through carefully.</i>

01:16:02.933 --> 01:16:05.425
<i>But the bribes got bigger
as the plot grew.</i>

01:16:05.936 --> 01:16:08.688
<i>That's why German took your
father to the Albanian's house.</i>

01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:11.316
<i>They needed dirty
money and fast...</i>

01:16:11.317 --> 01:16:15.185
<i>And German was already experienced
in these types of operations.</i>

01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:18.907
Do you want to tell me
what's wrong with you?

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:21.701
My stomach hurts a bit.
It's nothing.

01:16:21.702 --> 01:16:22.410
You coming in?

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:23.912
Yes. Yes.

01:16:23.913 --> 01:16:25.028
Just a moment.

01:16:29.043 --> 01:16:32.832
Relax, man. You can cure
with a good fuck.

01:16:34.215 --> 01:16:36.331
<i>You can cure that
with a good fuck.</i>

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:38.250
Not today... I'm not <i>in</i> the mood.

01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:40.053
"Diari I'Autonomic" News Desk

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:43.223
<i>There's money here, Felix.</i>

01:16:43.224 --> 01:16:45.642
<i>And if everything goes right,
there's money for all of us.</i>

01:16:45.643 --> 01:16:46.724
<i>Big bucks.</i>

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:49.393
<i>We can do it without them.</i>

01:16:49.814 --> 01:16:51.815
<i>We don't need their money.</i>

01:16:51.816 --> 01:16:53.807
<i>Are you gonna pay
the 500 million?</i>

01:16:54.527 --> 01:16:55.688
<i>Are you?</i>

01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:57.523
And who pays your part?

01:17:00.324 --> 01:17:03.112
In less than ten years we'll be
living like fucking kings.

01:17:03.327 --> 01:17:04.408
I swear.

01:17:07.832 --> 01:17:09.539
We're gonna be filthy rich.

01:18:14.815 --> 01:18:16.021
Why did you lock the door?

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:18.607
Wanted to take a shit.

01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:34.833
I think you wanted to...
do a sneaky line. Here.

01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:01.108
Are you like this
because of your brother?

01:19:05.699 --> 01:19:09.192
Let him have the house, come on.
We don't need that money.

01:19:11.205 --> 01:19:12.205
No.

01:19:16.627 --> 01:19:18.709
I'm going to tear down that
fucking house.

01:19:22.925 --> 01:19:24.541
Look.

01:19:27.137 --> 01:19:31.722
Tell that urban planning officer
that we're not fucking paying 500.

01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:34.435
He'll take 300 or
he can fuck himself.

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:37.303
We deposit it in cash in a
security box in the bank.

01:19:37.523 --> 01:19:38.022
With his signature and mine.

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:42.017
When everything is clear we
both open it...

01:19:42.528 --> 01:19:43.893
He takes the money and that's it.

01:19:45.906 --> 01:19:48.032
You make sure that
bastard is happy...

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:52.527
that I'll take care of the rest of the
owners and the construction company.

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:55.701
Right?

01:19:58.544 --> 01:20:00.034
Félix...

01:20:05.217 --> 01:20:07.128
I love you, for fuck's sake.

01:20:07.344 --> 01:20:08.926
I love you.

01:20:11.932 --> 01:20:14.219
<i>That night,
the tape disappeared...</i>

01:20:14.351 --> 01:20:15.933
and so did you uncle Pau.

01:20:16.437 --> 01:20:18.303
We never heard from him again.

01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:29.824
That's why my father wanted to
leave the party...

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:32.225
Your father wanted to leave
everything but we didn't let him.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.987
With that tape missing we had to
protect ourselves any way we could.

01:20:36.707 --> 01:20:37.913
He couldn't leave it.

01:20:39.043 --> 01:20:40.704
And that's why they killed him?

01:20:42.212 --> 01:20:43.327
No.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:45.840
I'm going to confess.

01:20:47.051 --> 01:20:49.213
No. It wasn't them.

01:20:49.345 --> 01:20:51.712
That tape doesn't have any
legal validity.

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:53.431
They aren't going to do
anything to us.

01:20:53.432 --> 01:20:55.639
There are people
willing to testify.

01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:57.727
<i>- What are you doing?
- Calling Mr. Guzman.</i>

01:20:57.728 --> 01:20:59.810
<i>I've already spoken to him,
for fuck's sake!</i>

01:21:02.066 --> 01:21:03.399
He says...

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:07.109
I have to sign a statement
accepting liability and resign.

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:11.689
He has written a statement
of confession for me.

01:21:11.825 --> 01:21:13.326
It's the only thing that can
reduce my sentence to...

01:21:13.327 --> 01:21:15.318
There is not going
to be any letter.

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.622
Nothing has happened here,

01:21:17.623 --> 01:21:19.916
I don't care if there are people
willing to testify...

01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:21.328
It was a trap.

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:34.636
The night I recorded the tape,

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:36.722
I went with German...

01:21:37.059 --> 01:21:39.141
<i>to an old farm the Albanians had.</i>

01:21:42.022 --> 01:21:43.604
She's here.

01:21:47.528 --> 01:21:51.522
They've brought Tirana's daughter.
I'll take care of Leandro.

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:58.413
German told me they had taken
a new girl there.

01:21:58.414 --> 01:22:01.327
A young Albanian
who'd been drugged.

01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:05.211
This way.

01:22:05.212 --> 01:22:07.704
Her mother wants her to work.

01:22:08.549 --> 01:22:12.838
They owe money and she wants to
help her mother pay.

01:22:21.145 --> 01:22:25.389
A little scared at the
beginning, but more relaxed now.

01:22:26.316 --> 01:22:29.308
She's a true Goddess.

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:38.326
Are you going in... or
shall we go together?

01:22:40.414 --> 01:22:42.415
<i>The next morning,</i>

01:22:42.416 --> 01:22:48.537
I found that girl at "The Marjal" country
house. She'd been shot in the back.

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:53.125
She was the daughter of the girl
my brother left with.

01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:56.043
I think they thought
she was dead.

01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:59.522
I picked her up and took her to Villar
Del Obispo, with Sister Micaela.

01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:04.594
And since then... I've taken care
of everything she's needed.

01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:09.192
You are going to deny everything.

01:23:09.193 --> 01:23:11.400
But what the fuck are
you talking about?

01:23:11.528 --> 01:23:14.614
It's over.
Don't you understand, Dora?

01:23:14.615 --> 01:23:17.335
I'm going to do whatever they say,
I'm going to tell them everything.

01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:19.533
Bitch!

01:23:20.537 --> 01:23:21.913
Let go of me!

01:23:21.914 --> 01:23:23.414
Stay still!

01:23:23.415 --> 01:23:24.707
Let go of me!

01:23:24.708 --> 01:23:27.416
Release the steering wheel,
fucking hell!

01:23:53.111 --> 01:23:56.979
She took out the breathing tube
herself. I haven't told anyone.

01:23:58.033 --> 01:23:59.523
She has left everything
written here.

01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:14.212
Pathetic.

01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:18.918
What?
What are you laughing about?

01:24:22.933 --> 01:24:26.642
<i>She has known for 20 years what my
father did to that poor girl...</i>

01:24:26.853 --> 01:24:28.184
<i>and so have I.</i>

01:24:30.107 --> 01:24:32.690
<i>The idiot recorded himself
while he did it.</i>

01:24:34.027 --> 01:24:35.027
I told her...

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:38.112
Right, mum?

01:24:44.037 --> 01:24:48.622
<i>A little scared at the beginning,
but more relaxed now.</i>

01:24:50.335 --> 01:24:52.918
She's a true Goddess.

01:24:58.844 --> 01:25:00.334
How old is she?

01:25:37.549 --> 01:25:38.710
Let me in!

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:40.545
Come on!

01:25:48.435 --> 01:25:50.346
Couldn't you hear me?

01:25:50.562 --> 01:25:52.803
I had the Walkman.

01:25:53.023 --> 01:25:54.809
I was calling you.

01:25:56.193 --> 01:25:57.193
Why did you come?

01:25:59.112 --> 01:26:00.112
I'm meeting your father.

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:03.405
They've gone to have
dinner at the club.

01:26:03.533 --> 01:26:05.615
Yeah, I know...

01:26:07.412 --> 01:26:09.119
Who hit you?

01:26:19.925 --> 01:26:20.925
Look, Diego.

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:26.428
We might not see each
other for some time.

01:26:28.433 --> 01:26:30.219
I'm leaving the village.

01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:32.347
Where are you going?

01:26:32.813 --> 01:26:35.180
I can't tell you yet.

01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:41.026
What's up? Are you okay?

01:26:45.617 --> 01:26:46.617
Shorty...

01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:48.817
What's up?

01:26:54.918 --> 01:26:55.918
You have...

01:26:56.128 --> 01:26:58.540
You have to...
listen to this.

01:27:01.633 --> 01:27:04.421
That's why you sent me
to the boarding school.

01:27:05.137 --> 01:27:06.137
What is this?

01:27:07.848 --> 01:27:09.928
That's why you kept it quiet
all those fucking years.

01:27:27.534 --> 01:27:29.195
<i>We are at the house</i>

01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:32.538
<i>where tonight a father and son
have been murdered,</i>

01:27:32.539 --> 01:27:34.623
<i>both of them residents of
this village.</i>

01:27:34.624 --> 01:27:36.744
<i>Right now the forensics are
leaving and as we can see,</i>

01:27:37.127 --> 01:27:40.711
<i>they are removing the bodies
of the victims...</i>

01:28:06.823 --> 01:28:07.823
Cousin...

01:28:08.116 --> 01:28:09.606
Hey, how are you?

01:28:11.703 --> 01:28:13.114
Fucking great.

01:28:15.415 --> 01:28:17.122
I know where she is...

01:28:19.544 --> 01:28:21.330
I've found Vera.

01:28:24.007 --> 01:28:25.998
SESSION WITH PAU

01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:31.138
<i>Welcome to Radio Oskura.
The purest "destroy" music.</i>

01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:32.721
<i>Take your hand away from there.</i>

01:28:32.849 --> 01:28:34.431
<i>Today, as you would say
in Argentina...</i>

01:28:34.559 --> 01:28:35.434
<i>Damn...</i>

01:28:35.435 --> 01:28:37.051
<i>I'm spinning this one.</i>

01:28:38.104 --> 01:28:39.104
<i>Yeah, of course...</i>

01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:42.181
<i>Don't even think about it. Take
that shit off my Technics!</i>

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:45.110
<i>Listen. I want to dedicate this
song to the great Bruno Lomas...</i>

01:28:45.111 --> 01:28:48.604
<i>to all the sons and daughters
of Rock & Roll...</i>

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:50.530
<i>Especially to one.</i>

01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:54.618
<i>Pau, come on,
nobody listens to this.</i>

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:56.590
<i>You see how there was
a moment of... silence?</i>

01:28:57.123 --> 01:28:58.204
<i>Come on... Take it off.</i>

01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:00.620
<i>Don't touch my Technics.
You're gonna break it.</i>

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.331
<i>Turn it up! Turn it up!</i>

01:29:31.533 --> 01:29:33.023
Did kids live here
with the Sisters?

01:29:34.119 --> 01:29:37.413
I don't know. If you want, I'll
ask Sister Micaela now.

01:29:37.414 --> 01:29:40.702
We only take care of the
maintenance of the convent.

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:44.125
Thank you.

01:29:45.338 --> 01:29:46.624
I'm going to call an ambulance.

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:47.840
No, no...

01:29:50.427 --> 01:29:51.838
I'm fine.

01:29:52.554 --> 01:29:54.044
Marifé.

01:29:54.556 --> 01:29:56.046
They're here.

01:30:10.196 --> 01:30:11.030
Vera.

01:30:11.031 --> 01:30:14.899
I've been looking for you
since my uncle Félix's funeral.

01:30:16.036 --> 01:30:17.526
Do you know him?

01:30:23.335 --> 01:30:25.326
You know exactly who I am.

01:30:26.546 --> 01:30:27.832
Come with me.

01:30:28.548 --> 01:30:29.548
It's okay.

01:30:35.055 --> 01:30:38.343
So, this is where they hid you?

01:30:40.143 --> 01:30:42.555
My life is very good this way.

01:30:43.813 --> 01:30:45.303
I want you to leave.

01:30:54.324 --> 01:30:56.033
I know what they did to
you, Vera.

01:30:56.034 --> 01:30:57.900
It was my uncle...

01:30:58.536 --> 01:30:59.620
Félix.

01:30:59.621 --> 01:31:01.703
Félix saved my life.

01:31:02.415 --> 01:31:03.415
No.

01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:07.121
Félix didn't save anybody's life.

01:31:08.421 --> 01:31:10.537
He hid you to save himself.

01:31:10.924 --> 01:31:13.217
That's why he brought you here,
so you would disappear.

01:31:13.218 --> 01:31:14.051
No.

01:31:14.052 --> 01:31:16.043
No?

01:31:18.223 --> 01:31:19.429
How did Félix get to you?

01:31:19.557 --> 01:31:20.922
I can't remember.

01:31:23.228 --> 01:31:25.515
Let's just leave it, please.

01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:29.397
I'm not leaving until
I find out the truth'

01:31:47.419 --> 01:31:49.330
They drugged me.

01:31:52.549 --> 01:31:54.836
I could hardly move.

01:31:58.722 --> 01:32:03.216
A man told me that if I didn't do
everything they asked me to...

01:32:03.852 --> 01:32:06.344
they would kill me and my mother.

01:32:10.108 --> 01:32:13.191
Then I told her everything
they'd done to me and...

01:32:14.696 --> 01:32:16.812
she told your father.

01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:19.700
And what happened?

01:32:19.826 --> 01:32:20.826
Jordi...

01:32:27.333 --> 01:32:28.823
Please...

01:32:30.336 --> 01:32:31.701
Please...

01:32:45.060 --> 01:32:48.178
Let's walk.
The house is close.

01:33:03.536 --> 01:33:05.829
<i>He said that the next day
Félix would give him the money</i>

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:08.117
<i>and we would leave Spain.</i>

01:33:09.042 --> 01:33:11.534
<i>That they would
never touch us again.</i>

01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:18.924
"Marjal" country house, 1996

01:33:19.844 --> 01:33:21.334
But it wasn't like that.

01:33:25.058 --> 01:33:27.140
They did come back.

01:33:27.352 --> 01:33:28.352
Pau.

01:33:34.025 --> 01:33:35.025
Félix...

01:33:47.914 --> 01:33:49.700
Go on, please.

01:33:51.417 --> 01:33:53.533
I woke up in Félix's car...

01:33:55.338 --> 01:33:58.547
my clothes were wet and
my back really hurt.

01:34:01.052 --> 01:34:05.216
He said he brought me here to protect
<i>me...</i> That my life was in danger.

01:34:06.558 --> 01:34:10.552
Félix has come to see me all these
years, Jordi. He didn't do it.

01:34:19.028 --> 01:34:20.814
Where is my father?

01:34:26.703 --> 01:34:28.535
He's dead, Jordi.

01:34:30.707 --> 01:34:32.833
I saw them shoot him in the head.

01:34:32.834 --> 01:34:33.915
Where is he?

01:34:35.336 --> 01:34:36.336
I'm so sorry.

01:34:42.135 --> 01:34:46.345
Where is he?

01:35:06.117 --> 01:35:09.109
It was a graveyard in the
post-war years.

01:35:11.206 --> 01:35:15.541
Felix buried them here thinking
they would never be discovered.

01:35:23.343 --> 01:35:24.549
Where?

01:35:26.638 --> 01:35:27.844
Here.

01:35:30.058 --> 01:35:33.346
I let him because...

01:35:36.606 --> 01:35:38.392
he told me...

01:35:38.524 --> 01:35:40.606
that it was better for her.

01:35:41.694 --> 01:35:43.526
They would have
tried to kill her.

01:36:04.634 --> 01:36:07.843
I'd never have imagined
that she was so close.

01:36:14.352 --> 01:36:16.559
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.

01:36:20.191 --> 01:36:21.191
What are we going to do?

01:40:57.343 --> 01:40:59.630
With them?
You want to go back with them?

01:41:02.056 --> 01:41:03.217
It's okay.

01:41:42.138 --> 01:41:44.129
Run! Run!

01:42:01.407 --> 01:42:03.318
Who else knew?

01:42:03.826 --> 01:42:05.032
Who?

01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.031
Only Leandro.

01:42:11.626 --> 01:42:13.116
And this guy's brother?

01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:17.538
Did his brother know you were
leaving with him?

01:42:18.633 --> 01:42:19.714
Go on.

01:42:19.925 --> 01:42:23.043
I wasn't leaving, I swear.

01:42:28.059 --> 01:42:29.424
Nobody knew.

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:30.560
Good.

01:42:30.853 --> 01:42:33.891
Don't be scared.

01:42:36.025 --> 01:42:37.265
Everything is going to be okay.

01:42:39.904 --> 01:42:41.520
Come on.

01:42:42.114 --> 01:42:43.604
Go and get the girl.

01:42:44.408 --> 01:42:45.819
Go.

01:43:21.821 --> 01:43:23.403
Relax.

01:43:23.698 --> 01:43:25.530
Don't be scared.

01:43:35.918 --> 01:43:37.204
No!

01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:38.420
No!

01:44:49.617 --> 01:44:50.325
Jordi?

01:44:50.326 --> 01:44:51.691
No...

01:44:52.536 --> 01:44:54.026
It's Vera.

01:45:31.116 --> 01:45:33.699
<i>Maybe part of everything
we saw and heard</i>

01:45:33.828 --> 01:45:36.320
<i>hides other things
that I will never discover...</i>

01:45:38.833 --> 01:45:39.707
<i>But now I know</i>

01:45:39.708 --> 01:45:42.700
<i>that all actions, even if all
the earth buries them,</i>

01:45:42.837 --> 01:45:46.046
<i>will be unearthed sooner or
later, for human eyes to see.</i>

01:45:51.428 --> 01:45:54.045
The Uncovering

01:48:30.713 --> 01:48:34.923
<i>Can I choose the music now?
Come on, take it off.</i>

01:48:39.722 --> 01:48:41.212
<i>This is so old, man.</i>

01:48:41.807 --> 01:48:44.845
<i>Take your hand away from there.</i>

01:48:45.644 --> 01:48:47.385
<i>I want to dedicate this song</i>

01:48:47.521 --> 01:48:50.684
<i>to all the sons and daughters
of Rock & Roll...</i>

01:48:51.108 --> 01:48:52.269
<i>Especially to one.</i>

01:48:52.609 --> 01:48:56.603
<i>Come on, take it off. Don't touch my
Technics. You're going to break it.</i>

01:48:57.305 --> 01:49:03.278
