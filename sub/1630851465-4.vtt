00:02.603 --> 00:04.837
-I've been working on my line
for the next season,

00:04.839 --> 00:07.740
and I want to do, like,
a pre-season fashion show.

00:07.742 --> 00:10.476
These ladies probably think
I have nothing to offer,

00:10.478 --> 00:12.244
but I want to show them
that there's more to me

00:12.246 --> 00:13.746
than meets the eye.

00:13.748 --> 00:15.914
<i> -How's, uh, looking for</i>
<i> a house out there?</i>

00:15.916 --> 00:18.784
-It's exhausting
and it's expensive.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.419
You know, you bougie.

00:20.421 --> 00:23.088
-My manager -- she's like,
"la'britney, I need you to have

00:23.090 --> 00:26.291
the song mixed and mastered,
your listening party

00:26.293 --> 00:28.427
properly planned out,
the location.

00:28.429 --> 00:29.595
She gave me three weeks.

00:29.597 --> 00:32.197
-That's a lot of pressure.
-Yeah.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.433
I'm just feeling
a little confused about,

00:34.435 --> 00:36.769
am I making the right decision
moving back?

00:36.771 --> 00:38.904
Um, I've also been
thinking about

00:38.906 --> 00:40.906
talking to someone
professionally.

00:40.908 --> 00:43.308
-We all need that.
-I highly recommend it.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.778
-It's definitely gonna be
helpful.

00:45.780 --> 00:47.579
What are you looking for
in a man?

00:47.581 --> 00:48.947
-So this is my man list, okay?
-Okay.

00:48.949 --> 00:50.416
-If I don't get this man
on this list,

00:50.418 --> 00:52.284
then I'm gonna be single
for the rest of my life.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.686
-I don't think that
that's realistic.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.755
-I feel like all men cheat.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.424
I believe in
cheating respectfully.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.359
I never tell my man, like,
"oh, you can go cheat on me."

01:00.361 --> 01:03.062
but I'm not leaving my man
over a one-night stand

01:03.064 --> 01:04.296
with a bitch, period.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.631
Like, I can love you
and cheat on you.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.166
I'm sorry. I believe it.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.967
It said that y'all had, like,
a little internet beef.

01:08.969 --> 01:11.804
And I was like, "internet beef?"
-with who? Stormey?

01:11.806 --> 01:13.939
-Mm-hmm.
-Me and stormey did?

01:13.941 --> 01:15.307
I've been around you.

01:15.309 --> 01:17.009
I've been in your home.
We've been talking.

01:17.011 --> 01:18.577
And why didn't you just
come to me?

01:18.579 --> 01:20.212
-Or maybe you wasn't gonna tell
her at all.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.747
-Ain't nobody gonna make me do
a motherfuckin' thing.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.682
-Well, it's like, for me...
-Oh, shut up.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.552
-If I have an issue with you,
I'm gonna say it to you.

through the window.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.200
Glad you accepted my invitation.

02:15.202 --> 02:17.603
-Absolutely.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.706
I felt like, you know, we need
a face-to-face on our own

02:20.708 --> 02:22.541
without the girls.
-Right.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.843
-So I had some time
to cool off last night.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.178
You know, (bleep) got weird.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.447
And, um, I value my friendship
with toni,

02:28.449 --> 02:30.249
and I know if I don't
get a chance to address this

02:30.251 --> 02:33.218
with her soon,
our friendship could be doomed.

02:33.220 --> 02:34.920
Whatever happened
at the pool party,

02:34.922 --> 02:36.822
I wanted to talk about it, so...

02:36.824 --> 02:38.323
-'cause it did get
a little heated.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.192
-Yeah.
-You carrying something

02:40.194 --> 02:41.760
that I don't even know
nothing about.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.529
-Well, I just wanted to make
sure that we was good.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.297
-For one thing, I don't even
play ig games.

02:45.299 --> 02:48.066
I don't even do that.
I just met mehgan,

02:48.068 --> 02:50.736
and she coming to me and telling
me what's going on.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.871
-Well, that's why
I'm telling you now.

02:52.873 --> 02:55.340
-I'm ready to hash it out
with stormey,

02:55.342 --> 02:58.410
but she has
a lot of explaining to do.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.579
I was really upset
about the whole thing because --

03:00.581 --> 03:02.247
-and I understand that,
and you are entitled

03:02.249 --> 03:04.516
to be upset about it
because the way it happened,

03:04.518 --> 03:06.652
and I actually wanted to
pull you to the side,

03:06.654 --> 03:09.254
but before I can even do that,
mehgan had, you know,

03:09.256 --> 03:10.789
opened her mouth
and said something.

03:10.791 --> 03:14.092
And I kind of felt like
I was put on, you know,

03:14.094 --> 03:16.261
the one on the spotlight,
and I didn't like it.

03:16.263 --> 03:18.931
I didn't like that position,
you know, because that's not

03:18.933 --> 03:20.432
how I presented it to her.

03:20.434 --> 03:23.068
And I know it kind of floated
around like it was messy,

03:23.070 --> 03:27.239
but my whole angle was never
messy, you know what I mean?

03:29.510 --> 03:33.111
-Since I met mehgan that night,
I thought about it constantly.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.380
You know,
I was getting madder and madder.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.683
So by the time I came in,
you know,

03:37.685 --> 03:40.352
all I could think about --
they laughing behind my back.

03:40.354 --> 03:41.954
It's -- you know,
it's a joke to y'all.

03:41.956 --> 03:44.289
-And it wasn't nothing
like that, absolutely nothing.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.924
I just told her that, you know,

03:45.926 --> 03:48.026
it's just something
that happened a while ago.

03:48.028 --> 03:51.330
I'm still kind of in,
you know, the fog about it.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.664
But I'm gonna say this.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.733
When I did tell her,
when I walked away,

03:54.735 --> 03:56.501
I was like, "dang it.
Why did I do that?"

03:56.503 --> 03:58.570
I didn't know her well enough
to share that with her.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.806
She made me feel like
she was trying to tell on me.

04:00.808 --> 04:03.175
And I didn't like -- ooh, girl,
I don't like that at all.

04:03.177 --> 04:05.410
-Right.
-You know, I would really like

04:05.412 --> 04:07.246
to know what
mehgan's intentions were.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.414
Do I have my feelings about it?
Yeah.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.849
Do I think she was messy?
Yeah.

04:10.851 --> 04:13.118
Do I think that
it was from a bad place?

04:13.120 --> 04:14.453
Yeah, I do feel all that.

04:14.455 --> 04:17.522
-In her defense,
didn't try to have any malice

04:17.524 --> 04:19.291
in it or anything.
-Well, the way she sat down

04:19.293 --> 04:21.159
on that couch and was like...
-Well, what she said about --

04:21.161 --> 04:23.095
-I was like, "hold up."
-right, when she said

04:23.097 --> 04:25.497
the beef part,
that's when it came to, like,

04:25.499 --> 04:27.132
"okay, what you mean
by 'the beef'?

04:27.134 --> 04:29.001
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

04:29.003 --> 04:32.638
-So the post had said
that I was -- well, not --

04:32.640 --> 04:33.972
-not you.
-Yeah.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.507
-Clear that up.
-That someone was

04:35.509 --> 04:36.975
riding your coattails.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.577
I was like, "girl, where is this
coming from?"

04:38.579 --> 04:41.380
I'm like, "I ain't ride
no coattails.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.881
She can't be talking about me."

04:42.883 --> 04:44.716
-maybe I liked the post.
Maybe it's something --

04:44.718 --> 04:46.251
I thought it was a cute caption,

04:46.253 --> 04:49.421
but it definitely wasn't
meant for you at all.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.923
-And my apologies for that,
because I didn't want to put you

04:51.925 --> 04:53.625
in that position,
you know what I mean?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.661
Woman to woman, I did not want
to put you in that position.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.663
-Right.
-I'm glad that we addressed it.

04:57.665 --> 05:01.333
I'm ready to let it go.
-I never had any ill feelings

05:01.335 --> 05:02.601
towards you, nothing.

05:02.603 --> 05:05.203
We should be able
to come to each other

05:05.205 --> 05:07.472
and talk to each other.
I might get mad.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.508
You might get mad.
But that's okay.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.410
-Yeah.
-We'll deal with it like that,

05:11.412 --> 05:12.944
but we'll get over it.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.280
It's important for me
to squash things with stormey

05:15.282 --> 05:17.482
because I don't want
to lose a friend

05:17.484 --> 05:19.718
because of something
she thinks I did.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.821
I heard her explanation.
I understand it.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.423
I just want to move forward.

05:24.425 --> 05:27.025
-I was planning on having, like,
a girls' night out at the house.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.094
-Mm-hmm.
-We gonna do a little cooking...

05:29.096 --> 05:30.629
-Okay.
-...And bring everybody

05:30.631 --> 05:33.098
together, but when I'm there,
I'm gonna talk to mehgan

05:33.100 --> 05:34.800
and, you know,
just let her know, like,

05:34.802 --> 05:37.102
"sometimes when
I share information with you,

05:37.104 --> 05:38.670
I'm trusting you
with that information."

05:38.672 --> 05:40.038
-right.
-Mehgan has definitely

05:40.040 --> 05:42.607
solidified why I do have
trust issues with people

05:42.609 --> 05:45.043
and opening up my circle
to new friends.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.511
I told her I had trust issues,

05:46.513 --> 05:48.547
and she went ahead
and violated my trust anyway.

05:48.549 --> 05:52.617

and handle my own business.

You wanted to be by the beach.

You wanted

You wanted a garage and parking.

this is what it gets you.

07:08.128 --> 07:11.096

out to l.A. Next week,

07:11.098 --> 07:14.900
and I have to find us a home
before they get here.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.868

I don't want them sleeping

07:28.982 --> 07:31.349
studio equipment
being shipped out here.

07:31.351 --> 07:33.351
Well, this is not gonna work.

it's something temporary,

frickin' all over the place,

07:39.126 --> 07:41.326
and it's driving me insane.
-I can tell.

07:41.328 --> 07:44.062
Like, you got this
listening party coming up,

07:44.064 --> 07:45.997
and I need you to focus on that.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.800
-All the things that I have
going on in my personal life

07:48.802 --> 07:51.670
stress me out,
and it is affecting my career.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.705
It's affecting me being able
to focus on

07:53.707 --> 07:56.208
finishing up this music
in the listening party.

07:56.210 --> 07:58.343
I have to get my personal life
in order.

07:58.345 --> 08:01.313
I have to find stability
and a foundation.

08:01.315 --> 08:04.416
It's hard to focus
when you don't have that.

08:04.418 --> 08:06.485
-Your personal stresses
are flowing

08:06.487 --> 08:07.686
into your business stresses,

08:07.688 --> 08:09.421
and we have stuff
we need to finish.

08:09.423 --> 08:12.958
Like, is the track finished?
Have you scheduled rehearsals?

08:12.960 --> 08:14.759
-Everything's in progress.

08:14.761 --> 08:17.963
I have rehearsals scheduled.
Um...

08:17.965 --> 08:21.766
I was in the studio finishing up
the mix on the track.

08:21.768 --> 08:24.836
-Okay. 'cause, I mean,
if this don't go right

08:24.838 --> 08:26.705
for that listening party,
we not even gonna have

08:26.707 --> 08:28.473
to worry about finding a place

08:28.475 --> 08:30.976
'cause all the eggs
are in that basket.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.745
We need to make sure
that that is right.

08:33.747 --> 08:36.448
-[sighs] I'm over it,
I'm out.

08:37.416 --> 08:39.484
-♪ I been places,
I seen faces ♪

08:39.486 --> 08:41.853
♪ lifted weights
up off the floor ♪

08:41.855 --> 08:44.723
♪ I fly high,
so how that goes ♪

08:44.725 --> 08:46.491

08:46.493 --> 08:47.993

08:47.995 --> 08:49.895
-these girls have to sell it
big-time virtually,

08:49.897 --> 08:52.197
'cause it's not like
we can really see them, right?

08:52.199 --> 08:53.465
-Right.
-They gotta come with it

08:53.467 --> 08:55.500
and bring...
-Face, all.

08:55.502 --> 08:59.204
-Face, body, life, personality.
-For sure.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.473
-I think it's really important
to put your swimwear

09:01.475 --> 09:03.542
in fashion shows
because you want to get buzz

09:03.544 --> 09:05.577
going before the next season.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.879
Rip the runway vibes, period.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.548
Those type of models
that I'm looking to cast

09:09.550 --> 09:11.116
in my fashion show vary.

09:11.118 --> 09:14.920
I want gay, straight, plus-size,
regular-size, short, tall.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.721
I just want everyone
to feel included.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.256
So are you ready
for the first one?

09:18.258 --> 09:20.492
-Yeah, let's do it.

09:20.494 --> 09:22.727
-Wow!
-Hey! You're beautiful.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.697
-Okay. Hi, princess. My name --
<i> -hi!</i>

09:25.699 --> 09:27.465
-My name's mehgan.
This is kevin.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.901
Um, so, we need to see
your best walk, honey.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.303
<i> -You want it with the dress?</i>

09:31.305 --> 09:33.638
-Oh, go ahead and strip down
to the clothes.

09:33.640 --> 09:36.341
This is a swimsuit competition,
sweetie.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.376
-[chuckles] okay.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.914
-Okay. Look at little princess!
-Pretty good. That's cute.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.083
I love it.
-Okay, body!

09:45.085 --> 09:48.119
-Love to see it.
-Yes! Love to see it.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.888
-I say yes to her.
-Yes to her? Okay.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.222
The reason I'm having
a fashion show

09:51.224 --> 09:52.991
is I want to elevate
my business.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.627
I want to elevate my company.
I'm tired of selling online.

09:55.629 --> 09:58.229
And I'll be so proud to see
my swimsuits on rodeo drive.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.465
I need to show these girls
that I'm not playing about

10:00.467 --> 10:03.535
what I do for a living,
so everything has to go perfect.

10:03.537 --> 10:05.236
Let's see who else we have.

10:05.238 --> 10:09.608
Three, two, one, and walk.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.509
Okay, little buns.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.111
-[laughs]
-yes!

10:13.113 --> 10:15.480
We -- I love a little bun.
I really like her.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.015
We need a white girl, for sure.
-Yes, you do.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.851
-She was cute. Okay, next.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.753
Is it real?
<i> -Yeah!</i>

10:21.755 --> 10:23.688
-Okay.
-Yes! We love to see it.

10:23.690 --> 10:26.157
<i> -Y'all will never...</i>
-Okay, who's next?

10:26.159 --> 10:28.126
Ah! Oh, my god.
You're beautiful.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.062
-She's beautiful, very gorgeous.
-Oh, you're so pretty.

10:31.064 --> 10:34.165
Hit the poses, hit the pose.
Don't forget to pose.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.835
Yes! That was cute.

10:36.837 --> 10:39.237
Okay. Cool.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.673
-Yeah, she's beautiful.
-Yes!

10:41.675 --> 10:44.609
Oh, perfect.

10:44.611 --> 10:46.411
Okay. Thank you so much.
Have a good night.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.179
<i> -You, too.</i>
-Bye-bye.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.781
-Yeah, she was cute.
I actually like her.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.716
-I like her, too.
I liked her natural hair.

10:51.718 --> 10:54.452
It's really cool.
[cellphone vibrates]

10:56.657 --> 10:59.324
-well, who's that calling you?

10:59.326 --> 11:01.126
-Titi stormey just text me

11:01.128 --> 11:02.894
inviting me
to some cooking at her house.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.963
Girl, you don't like me.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.665
I'm not your friend. Remember?

11:06.667 --> 11:09.801
-I had told them that I had some
reservations about something,

11:09.803 --> 11:11.736
and it wasn't
that big of a deal, and --

11:11.738 --> 11:13.672
-but you remembered it enough
to tell them.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.240
-I knew when I brought it to her

11:15.242 --> 11:17.742
that it was in the wrong hands,
you know what I mean?

11:17.744 --> 11:19.377
Because she ain't no
real friend to me.

11:19.379 --> 11:23.048
-Like, sis, who are you?
Like, jekyll or mr. Hyde?

11:23.050 --> 11:24.616
Not coming.

11:24.618 --> 11:27.786
Stormey snapped on me.
-Why?

11:27.788 --> 11:30.221
-Because auntie toni said --
-why you say "auntie"?

11:30.223 --> 11:31.756
'cause they're older women?
-Mm-hmm.

11:31.758 --> 11:34.259
-Okay. Shady bitch.
-Yeah.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.361
So toni says she's really cool,

11:36.363 --> 11:38.563
and, um,
I happened to lunch with her,

11:38.565 --> 11:41.700
and, uh, stormey had said
that her tonesa had got into it,

11:41.702 --> 11:43.168
so I was like,
"so what happened with y'all?"

11:43.170 --> 11:44.636
and tonesa was like,
"what you talking about?"

11:44.638 --> 11:46.337
I was like, "oh, so y'all
not beefing?" like...

11:46.339 --> 11:47.639
-Yeah.
-She's like, "beef?"

11:47.641 --> 11:49.007
I was like, "oh, like,

11:49.009 --> 11:50.408
maybe I wasn't supposed to
tell you this."

11:50.410 --> 11:52.043
she's like, "no, tell me."
so I told her

11:52.045 --> 11:54.045
what stormey had said.
What?

11:54.047 --> 11:57.515
-Yeah, that was kind of,
like, a little nasty.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.050
She probably didn't --
she should --

11:59.052 --> 12:01.352
maybe as a friend,
you should have told her.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.621
-So when I get to
stormey's house

12:03.623 --> 12:05.990
for her little, um,
swim pool party,

12:05.992 --> 12:09.928
she came for me, talking about,
oh, I need to shut up

12:09.930 --> 12:11.162
and I don't know
what's going on,

12:11.164 --> 12:12.430
I need to keep my mouth closed.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.965
And instead of, like, you know,

12:13.967 --> 12:15.967
expressing that she had
a problem with toni,

12:15.969 --> 12:17.869
she took it out on me because
she think I'm the underdog.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.437
But I'm about to argue
with titi.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.339
-Right.
-Stormey definitely owes me

12:21.341 --> 12:24.175
an apology, and she will never
see me again until I get that.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.010
I was taught to respect
my elders, honey,

12:26.012 --> 12:28.580
and I'm about to be
out here arguing with titi.

12:28.582 --> 12:30.215
I ain't doing that.

12:30.217 --> 12:33.551

-Hey!

12:53.974 --> 12:55.306
Good to finally see you!

12:55.308 --> 12:58.109
-Yeah, it's nice to finally
see you as well.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.544
Thank you for coming out.
-Yes.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.312
-You know, this is
the first time that

13:01.314 --> 13:04.549
I will have ever sat down
with a therapist.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.017
I am a little worried

13:06.019 --> 13:09.254
what she may uncover
or may dig out of me.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.589
But I -- ultimately,
I think that

13:11.591 --> 13:14.726
it's the best decision for me.

13:14.728 --> 13:16.795
All righty.

13:16.797 --> 13:21.466
-So I know we talked
just a little bit on the phone.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.735
-Yeah.
-But here we are.

13:23.737 --> 13:25.537
-Yes.
-So why don't you tell me

13:25.539 --> 13:27.005
what's going on?

13:27.007 --> 13:29.974
-I've been in the process
of transitioning back to l.A.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.677
I had, um,
moved from los angeles

13:32.679 --> 13:35.847
and what I consider
in a very bad mind state.

13:35.849 --> 13:39.350
-What was the deciding factor
to leave los angeles?

13:39.352 --> 13:43.521
-Well, suge had, um, an incident
where someone was killed,

13:43.523 --> 13:46.658
and when that person
lost their life,

13:46.660 --> 13:48.927
obviously, their family members
are very upset.

13:48.929 --> 13:53.398
And I felt that those emotions
were -- could cross over

13:53.400 --> 13:55.333
to myself and my children.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.302
And I just felt
that it was just best for us

13:57.304 --> 13:58.837
to just get out the way.

13:58.839 --> 14:02.540
-So if we had to list the things
that need to be addressed,

14:02.542 --> 14:03.942
what are those things?

14:03.944 --> 14:06.811
-I know I struggle with
trust issues with people.

14:06.813 --> 14:10.181
I've been burned a few times
with bringing people in

14:10.183 --> 14:12.784
and allowing them
to get close to me,

14:12.786 --> 14:14.819
and something bad happened.

14:14.821 --> 14:19.324
-Can you share a situation
where you were burned?

14:19.326 --> 14:22.527
-It was an incident where I felt
that one of my friends

14:22.529 --> 14:26.030
had, um, had me set up
and had my house robbed,

14:26.032 --> 14:28.800
and, um, I had a home invasion.

14:28.802 --> 14:30.735
Now, since I'm coming back,

14:30.737 --> 14:32.971
I'm having just
a little bit of anxiety

14:32.973 --> 14:36.374
about what may come back
when I'm here.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.244
-Are there other relationships
or incidents

14:39.246 --> 14:42.947
that you've had
some trust issues?

14:42.949 --> 14:44.949
-My mom has spent a lot of time
in prison,

14:44.951 --> 14:51.289
so she wasn't able to be the mom
that some of us needed.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.991
-What does that mean?

14:52.993 --> 14:54.926
-You know,
when you need your mom,

14:54.928 --> 14:58.162
you need to have that
conversation with your mom,

14:58.164 --> 15:01.866
and you don't have that person
to talk to or, you know,

15:01.868 --> 15:03.668
like, who you're gonna trust.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.336
You know, I always trust my mom.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.171
-Yeah.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.207
-Well, the thing is,
when she went away,

15:09.209 --> 15:11.876
my kids' dad actually
went away at the same time.

15:11.878 --> 15:15.346
-Oh.
-So I'm going to one court case

15:15.348 --> 15:18.917
and then a couple of days later,
I'm going to his court case.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.019
So that was pretty tough.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.655
The year prior to it,
I just had my son,

15:23.657 --> 15:25.223
and everything
was just wonderful.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.525
And my whole family dynamic
has changed.

15:27.527 --> 15:30.428
Everything I knew was gone,
and I was just really young.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.297
I was surrounded by people
I didn't trust,

15:32.299 --> 15:34.198
and I just didn't know
what to do.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.567
-Who was there for you?
-No one.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.271
-How did you manage that?

15:40.273 --> 15:42.707
What -- what were
those nights like?

15:42.709 --> 15:46.844
-I was very much worried
about my family...

15:46.846 --> 15:50.081
What they were going through
in prison.

15:50.083 --> 15:55.853
Like, those two people
I love so much.

15:55.855 --> 16:00.191
So to see them suffer
was really hard.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.560
Those are the only two people
at that time in my life

16:02.562 --> 16:04.495
I felt that would ever love me.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.264
When you lose
your support system,

16:06.266 --> 16:08.866
just like you lose the ground
under your feet.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.368
I will never want to relive it.

16:10.370 --> 16:13.338
That pain that I remember
is, um, still here.

16:13.340 --> 16:17.308
And I don't know if I can handle
being here in l.A. Emotionally.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.778
-You have an ability to be
literally the picture

16:20.780 --> 16:22.013
of healing for someone else,

16:22.015 --> 16:24.015
but we got to get it
for you first.

16:24.017 --> 16:29.320
And the only way to do that
is to put the deep soul hurt

16:29.322 --> 16:31.723
on the table and look at it.

16:31.725 --> 16:34.292
This is the process of healing.

25:31.964 --> 25:36.333
and I know that you're gonna
be able to help her love life

25:36.335 --> 25:38.302
and find her
the man of her dreams.

25:38.304 --> 25:41.171
-Period, 'cause I got a list.
-I can't wait to see it.

25:41.173 --> 25:43.040
<i> -Um, so I heard about</i>
<i> this list.</i>

25:43.042 --> 25:44.475
<i> I'm a little terrified,</i>

25:44.477 --> 25:46.110
<i> but, um, I'm sure</i>
<i> we'll figure it out.</i>

25:46.112 --> 25:48.345
<i> So tell me a little bit</i>
<i> about yourself.</i>

25:48.347 --> 25:51.815
-Okay, so my name's mehgan,
just turned 30.

25:51.817 --> 25:53.450
I design clothes for a living.

25:53.452 --> 25:55.653
My relationships
have been tragic.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.221
I think I'm cursed.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.390
<i> -Okay, why are your</i>
<i> relationships cursed?</i>

25:59.392 --> 26:02.626
-So this lady supposedly
put a curse on my family.

26:02.628 --> 26:05.529
My dad was, like, this big,
like, rapper back in the day.

26:05.531 --> 26:07.364
Like, he had all the bitches,
period.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.166
And he was dealing
with this one lady.

26:09.168 --> 26:10.734
Supposedly, the lady
did witchcraft.

26:10.736 --> 26:14.204
She put a spell on anyone
attached to my father that,

26:14.206 --> 26:15.439
whoever is attached to this man

26:15.441 --> 26:17.141
will never find love
or happiness.

26:17.143 --> 26:19.543
My other siblings -- none of us
are married with children.

26:19.545 --> 26:21.612
He has six kids
by six different women.

26:21.614 --> 26:23.414
None of the women
are married either.

26:23.416 --> 26:25.716
It's all tragic over here,
so I feel like it's a curse.

26:25.718 --> 26:28.519
<i> -It's probably not a curse.</i>
-Oh, okay.

26:28.521 --> 26:30.854
<i> -There's probably</i>
<i> something else going on.</i>

26:30.856 --> 26:33.390
<i> What do you want to get out</i>
<i> of this relationship?</i>

26:33.392 --> 26:34.959
<i> Are you looking to</i>
<i> get married?</i>

26:34.961 --> 26:37.027
-I want to get married.
Like, I'm knocking on 30.

26:37.029 --> 26:39.663
These eggs is drying up.
I want a child.

26:39.665 --> 26:42.633
<i> -So what kind of people</i>
<i> have you dated in the past?</i>

26:42.635 --> 26:44.868
-I have dated all type of men.

26:44.870 --> 26:47.471
Like, I had a thing for athletes
at one point in my life.

26:47.473 --> 26:50.941
That didn't work, then I started
trying to date white guys, girl.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.142
That didn't work.

26:52.144 --> 26:53.844
Then I started dating
this arabian man,

26:53.846 --> 26:55.813
and he was trying to control me,
calling me every five minutes.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.648
In my experience,
all these guys are the same.

26:57.650 --> 26:59.183
You know,
in a world full of futures,

26:59.185 --> 27:01.986
I'm looking for my russell,
you feel me?

27:01.988 --> 27:05.189
<i> -I'm curious to know more</i>
<i> about this list.</i>

27:05.191 --> 27:08.292
<i> Everyone says it's long.</i>
<i> Let's talk about it.</i>

27:08.294 --> 27:12.429
-So, um, I made my list
very, very specific.

27:12.431 --> 27:15.332
I want him to have nice hair.
I want him to be spiritual.

27:15.334 --> 27:17.468
I don't want him
to have any kids.

27:17.470 --> 27:19.103
I want him to have money.

27:19.105 --> 27:22.473
I want him to be successful,
like, well-known and respected.

27:22.475 --> 27:25.075
I want 6-foot minimum,

27:25.077 --> 27:26.744
in both inches, period.

27:26.746 --> 27:28.112
[laughs]
no, I'm just kidding.

27:28.114 --> 27:30.381
Only in height, only in height.

27:30.383 --> 27:33.617
And then, um, what else?
What's my other top one?

27:33.619 --> 27:35.386
I just said
the most important ones.

27:35.388 --> 27:37.755
-See,
that's the (bleep) problem.

27:37.757 --> 27:39.423
-I want somebody that can forget
my past

27:39.425 --> 27:41.025
'cause, you know,
everybody got a past,

27:41.027 --> 27:42.626
and I need somebody
they can get past the past.

27:42.628 --> 27:44.662
I don't want him
to have been married before.

27:44.664 --> 27:46.096
I want to be his first
everything.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.065
Oh, he got to be darker
than a paper bag

27:48.067 --> 27:50.234
'cause, you know,
black lives matter, okay?

27:50.236 --> 27:52.469
I want to marry me a black man,
period.

27:52.471 --> 27:54.238
<i> -This list is real interesting.</i>

27:54.240 --> 27:56.340
-I got one more.
-Okay, go for it.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.842
-He got to at least make
a million dollars a year.

27:58.844 --> 28:01.111
-Are you serious?
-I know drug dealers

28:01.113 --> 28:02.780
that make a million dollars
a year now.

28:02.782 --> 28:05.115
<i> -Just so anybody knows,</i>
<i> that's not who I work with.</i>

28:05.117 --> 28:07.084
-Okay.
<i> -Here's the thing.</i>

28:07.086 --> 28:09.186
<i> A lot of these guys,</i>
<i> you know,</i>

28:09.188 --> 28:11.321
<i> they feel a certain kind of way</i>
<i> about a woman</i>

28:11.323 --> 28:13.190
<i> who's trying to get for them</i>
<i> for that cash.</i>

28:13.192 --> 28:16.160
-Look, I don't -- I'm not trying
to get for him for his cash.

28:16.162 --> 28:17.861
Cash, to me, is security.

28:17.863 --> 28:20.097
I want my kids to be able
to not want for things.

28:20.099 --> 28:21.565
Like, I wanted for things
as a child.

28:21.567 --> 28:23.967
I want to be able
to take my kids on trips.

28:23.969 --> 28:26.036
I want my kids to have
the latest and the greatest.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.404
Like, I want to be comfortable.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.006
You know, I pay --
I pay all my own bills.

28:29.008 --> 28:31.542
I bought my own titties,
you feel me? I bought these.

28:31.544 --> 28:33.510
So I don't need a (bleep)
for his money.

28:33.512 --> 28:35.079
But it's security.
It's for, like...

28:35.081 --> 28:37.347
<i> -You know what?</i>
<i> It actually isn't so much</i>

28:37.349 --> 28:39.316
<i> about how much money they make.</i>

28:39.318 --> 28:41.852
<i> It's more about who they are.</i>

28:41.854 --> 28:45.656
<i> No one person ever gets</i>
<i> every single thing.</i>

28:45.658 --> 28:48.792
-Mehgan's list --
to me, the main things

28:48.794 --> 28:51.862
that you need in a relationship,
she's totally over overlooking

28:51.864 --> 28:55.466
those qualities, you know,
like, honesty, loyal.

28:55.468 --> 28:57.267
You know, like,
those type of things --

28:57.269 --> 29:00.471
that's what keep a relationship
strong and lasting,

29:00.473 --> 29:03.874
not him being darker
than a brown paper bag.

29:03.876 --> 29:05.843
I-I want my good sis

29:05.845 --> 29:09.947
to really, uh, know her value
as a woman and understand

29:09.949 --> 29:14.284
that she does not have to settle
and be okay with a man cheating.

29:14.286 --> 29:17.321
-As long as he cheats
respectfully, I'm not leaving.

29:17.323 --> 29:20.257
<i> -Why?</i>
-Because (bleep) cheat!

29:20.259 --> 29:21.692
<i> -No!</i>
-Yes!

29:21.694 --> 29:23.160
<i> -There's a lot of men</i>
<i> that do not cheat.</i>

29:23.162 --> 29:25.562
-Okay, jasmine.
-They love their women,

29:25.564 --> 29:27.364
and they will be faithful
to the end.

29:27.366 --> 29:28.632
-Okay, jasmine.

29:28.634 --> 29:29.933
<i> -Don't you think</i>
<i> you deserve that?</i>

29:29.935 --> 29:32.169
-I do, jasmine.
-Do you want that?

29:32.171 --> 29:33.570
-I do.

29:33.572 --> 29:35.539
[laughter]

29:35.541 --> 29:37.174
but I'm just --
I just be feeling like

29:37.176 --> 29:39.710
I be being realistic, like...
-No!

29:39.712 --> 29:41.145
<i> -And you need to compromise</i>
<i> on some of that</i>

29:41.147 --> 29:42.713
<i> other stuff on the list...</i>
-Mnh-mnh.

29:42.715 --> 29:44.448
<i> -...But that part...</i>
-Mnh-mnh, 6 feet? Mnh-mnh.

29:44.450 --> 29:46.083
<i> -...You do not have to</i>
<i> compromise.</i>

29:46.085 --> 29:48.552
-You know, I have different
standards than you do

29:48.554 --> 29:50.320
when it comes to dating
and relationships.

29:50.322 --> 29:51.722
I may sound dumb.

29:51.724 --> 29:54.258
I know I'm gonna get
a lot of backlash,

29:54.260 --> 29:56.226
but I'm just being real.

29:56.228 --> 29:58.328
La'britney, you single, sis.

29:58.330 --> 30:01.632
So maybe you should
try it my way once or twice.

30:01.634 --> 30:05.869
<i> -I think what you might be</i>
<i> missing is the values,</i>

30:05.871 --> 30:07.504
<i> the goals, the dreams.</i>

30:07.506 --> 30:10.974
-I think that she needs to feel
what real love feels like,

30:10.976 --> 30:12.409
because when I hear her speak,

30:12.411 --> 30:15.379
I feel like I don't think
you've had that yet.

30:15.381 --> 30:17.548
-I fall in love with every guy
that I start dating.

30:17.550 --> 30:19.249
I think I've only been in,
like, real love,

30:19.251 --> 30:20.751
maybe like three times.

30:20.753 --> 30:22.452
But I do be falling in love
with these guys, like,

30:22.454 --> 30:24.321
really quick, like, and I'd be
heartbroken really quick,

30:24.323 --> 30:26.156
but then I get over it
really quick, too.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.758
So maybe it's not real love.

30:27.760 --> 30:30.427
<i> -I mean, in order to get to,</i>
<i> you know,</i>

30:30.429 --> 30:32.830
<i> that ciara-russell situation,</i>

30:32.832 --> 30:35.599
<i> there needs to be</i>
<i> a level of maturity there.</i>

30:35.601 --> 30:38.902
-I understand, and I feel like
I'm a bit childish, okay, yeah.

30:38.904 --> 30:41.004
I'm a little childish.

30:41.006 --> 30:43.607
<i> -I think I understand</i>
<i> kind of, like, what you want.</i>

30:43.609 --> 30:45.509
-I'm ready, sis.
<i> -I'm gonna work on it.</i>

30:45.511 --> 30:47.244
<i> I'm gonna have me and my team</i>
<i> work on it.</i>

30:47.246 --> 30:49.847
-Now let's find this man.

30:51.182 --> 30:52.616
-♪ I can feel it ♪

30:52.618 --> 30:54.084
♪ I can feel it coming over me ♪

30:54.086 --> 30:57.321
♪ I know this is not what
it's supposed to be ♪

30:57.323 --> 30:59.389
♪ you ain't never standing
over me ♪

30:59.391 --> 31:02.993
♪ 'cause it's never really over
till it's over, see ♪

31:02.995 --> 31:04.428
-girl, I'm so glad you came by.

31:04.430 --> 31:07.130
You know, that cooking night
was so much fun.

31:07.132 --> 31:09.132
I had a ball. The food was good.

31:09.134 --> 31:10.500
The liquor was good.
-It was good.

31:10.502 --> 31:12.336
-It was really fun.
-Yeah, it was fun.

31:12.338 --> 31:14.037
-Yeah.
So I talked to the author.

31:14.039 --> 31:17.274
I was feeling really good --
really, really good, excited.

31:17.276 --> 31:21.578
-It's a wonderful way to heal.
-That's why I'm writing it,

31:21.580 --> 31:24.114
because it's like
therapy for me.

31:24.116 --> 31:25.949
Then I talked to my friend
keisha.

31:25.951 --> 31:28.151
-Uh-oh.
<i> -Have you talked to your sons</i>

31:28.153 --> 31:30.053
<i> about it?</i>
-No, I haven't.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.055
<i> -Do you think the reason</i>
<i> why you haven't talked to them</i>

31:32.057 --> 31:34.591
<i> because you're afraid they're</i>
<i> gonna give you pushback?</i>

31:34.593 --> 31:35.993
-[exhales]

31:35.995 --> 31:37.361
I have to consider their
feelings.

31:37.363 --> 31:38.896
I didn't even think about that.
-Yeah.

31:38.898 --> 31:40.764
-I'm like, honey,
this is my book, it's my life.

31:40.766 --> 31:42.299
-And it's your story, yeah.
-And my story.

31:42.301 --> 31:45.335
But I still, you know --
there's some things in there

31:45.337 --> 31:47.170
that they don't know about me,
you know?

31:47.172 --> 31:50.340
And so I have to discuss
these things with them.

31:50.342 --> 31:52.509
Plus, like, they're part
of my story.

31:52.511 --> 31:55.913
You know, then there's terry.
He's part of my history.

31:55.915 --> 31:58.282
-Now, how does he feel
about you writing the book?

31:58.284 --> 31:59.716
-[sighs] I don't know yet.

31:59.718 --> 32:01.151
-Have you even mentioned it
to any of them?

32:01.153 --> 32:03.487
-I mentioned it,
but I got to sit down

32:03.489 --> 32:04.788
and talk to them about it.

32:04.790 --> 32:06.423
It's more like I was just
telling them,

32:06.425 --> 32:07.791
"I'm writing a book."
-mm-hmm.

32:07.793 --> 32:09.960
-But I never thought about
or considered

32:09.962 --> 32:11.862
how they might feel.

32:11.864 --> 32:14.197
So that part I'm feeling
really nervous about.

32:14.199 --> 32:16.166
It just sucked the air
out of me, you know?

32:16.168 --> 32:18.635
-Yeah.
-And I'm not ready for it.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.037
-Yeah.
-I don't have a good

32:20.039 --> 32:22.005
relationship with jason,
my middle son.

32:22.007 --> 32:25.542
So how do I prepare for
all that? I just don't know.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.844
My biggest fears about
writing this book

32:27.846 --> 32:30.847
is how my family
are gonna look at me.

32:30.849 --> 32:33.383
It's difficult writing about
your life.

32:33.385 --> 32:35.519
There's things that
I'm not proud about.

32:35.521 --> 32:38.722
So, yeah, I'm nervous about this
'cause now I have to relive it

32:38.724 --> 32:40.257
and talk about it.

32:40.259 --> 32:44.127
Because if I reach out to them
and they say no,

32:44.129 --> 32:45.696
it's gonna -- ugh!

32:45.698 --> 32:47.798
-You're not gonna stop, are you?

32:47.800 --> 32:49.232
-I don't know.

32:49.234 --> 32:52.936
That's why I came back to l.A.,
to write my book.

32:52.938 --> 32:55.038
-Mm-hmm.
-You know, this is about me.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.207
I still have not told terry

32:57.209 --> 33:02.412
or my boys about my book
because this book is about me,

33:02.414 --> 33:04.581
and I've always
put other people first.

33:04.583 --> 33:08.085
And I'm afraid if I tell them,
they'll talk me out of it

33:08.087 --> 33:11.121
and I'll end up giving up
on my dream.

33:11.123 --> 33:13.090
Was anybody upset when you wrote
that -- your book?

33:13.092 --> 33:16.026
-Well, yeah, there were people
who were part of my life

33:16.028 --> 33:18.295
that were concerned about
how I would talk about them

33:18.297 --> 33:19.663
in my story.
-Uh-huh.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.765
-Of course, suge was more so
worried about --

33:21.767 --> 33:23.500
more than anybody.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.435
He was -- he was actually upset

33:25.437 --> 33:27.004
that I went forward
with the book,

33:27.006 --> 33:29.439
because he kept telling me,
"don't tell my story."

33:29.441 --> 33:31.108
and I said, "well, your story's
not my story.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.010
I just happened to be
a part of your life."

33:33.012 --> 33:35.479
I had to stand my ground
and actually say,

33:35.481 --> 33:37.214
"lk, y'all lived y'all lives.

33:37.216 --> 33:39.349
Let me tell my story the way
I want to tell my story,

33:39.351 --> 33:40.751
because this is my truth."

33:40.753 --> 33:41.952
so when I released my book,

33:41.954 --> 33:43.587
there was a few people
in my life

33:43.589 --> 33:46.656
that I received some backlash
about, even my kids' dad.

33:46.658 --> 33:49.292
He was upset about
how I may tell the story

33:49.294 --> 33:50.894
and how he may look
in the story.

33:50.896 --> 33:53.096
I say, "hey, you know,
the truth is the truth."

33:53.098 --> 33:55.732
and I had to be fearless
about that.

33:55.734 --> 33:58.235
I never doubt that my story
was not worth telling.

33:58.237 --> 34:00.670
-You know, but when you're
talking about yourself,

34:00.672 --> 34:03.940
there's some hurtful things
that can come out, so...

34:03.942 --> 34:05.776
-Know what?
You just have to be honest.

34:05.778 --> 34:07.711
Sometimes the truth
is not always pretty,

34:07.713 --> 34:09.146
you know what I mean?
And what someone else

34:09.148 --> 34:10.981
done put us through
is not always the...

34:10.983 --> 34:13.050
-Right.
-...You know, the best side

34:13.052 --> 34:14.851
that we want to show,
but, you know,

34:14.853 --> 34:16.353
that's what makes
you who you are today.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.789
-Even though I still don't know

34:18.791 --> 34:21.191
how my sons or terry
is gonna feel,

34:21.193 --> 34:22.793
I think I'm ready
to write my book now.

34:22.795 --> 34:26.363
I think that this is something
that I need to do.

34:26.365 --> 34:27.998
I feel so passionate about it.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.600
I'm not concerned about
what anybody thinks right now.

34:30.602 --> 34:33.236
-So, yeah, girl, just continue
with your writing process.

34:33.238 --> 34:35.405
I wouldn't even worry
about what's, you know,

34:35.407 --> 34:37.107
gonna be in your story.
-Mm-hmm.

34:37.109 --> 34:41.044
-Just stay true to yourself
and, girl, it's gonna be fine.

34:44.483 --> 34:47.584

35:33.832 --> 35:35.465
I don't know what's going on.

35:35.467 --> 35:38.802
Um, all you literally got to do
is move to the right.

35:38.804 --> 35:41.071
Right, left,
but with oomph.

35:41.073 --> 35:44.307
Mean it.
Five, six, seven, eight.

35:44.309 --> 35:46.409
To the right. There you go.

35:46.411 --> 35:48.278
Why are you looking
at the floor?

35:48.280 --> 35:50.147
Here we go. Focus.
Are you okay today?

35:50.149 --> 35:51.648
Did you eat breakfast?

35:51.650 --> 35:53.884
-Um, no, I didn't eat breakfast,
but I'm fine, though.

35:53.886 --> 35:55.785
-You need a little cracker
or something?

35:55.787 --> 35:57.854
-It has been a long...
-Long day?

35:57.856 --> 35:59.523
-...Long day, long night.
-Okay.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.591
You know I love you.
I-I love what you do.

36:01.593 --> 36:03.560
But you want to make sure
that you're stepping up

36:03.562 --> 36:05.195
to the plate every single time.

36:05.197 --> 36:07.464
You can't come in here
and 'cause you're tired,

36:07.466 --> 36:09.032
you're letting things go.
-Yeah.

36:09.034 --> 36:11.201
-That's that's not
what an artist does.

36:11.203 --> 36:12.369
-Right.

36:12.371 --> 36:14.037
It's very important to me.

36:14.039 --> 36:16.773
That, like,
my performance is perfect.

36:16.775 --> 36:18.642
I am a perfectionist.

36:18.644 --> 36:21.945
But today, you know, it's just
like I'm feeling tired.

36:21.947 --> 36:25.815
I have a lot on my mind,
and so I'm not feeling,

36:25.817 --> 36:28.151
like, super excited
about this rehearsal.

36:28.153 --> 36:30.921
I just -- I just have
no energy right now.

36:30.923 --> 36:32.355
-Hollywood, can you give me
a few moments

36:32.357 --> 36:34.491
to talk to la'britney?
-Yes, yes, yes.

36:34.493 --> 36:37.060
-What's going on?
-I mean, you know,

36:37.062 --> 36:39.796
it's been hard to sleep
'cause, like, you know,

36:39.798 --> 36:42.999
I ain't been seeing the boys
in weeks now.

36:43.001 --> 36:44.267
I miss them.

36:44.269 --> 36:46.102
I'm trying to find
a place to live,

36:46.104 --> 36:49.639
still trying to finish up
the music, "ducked off,"

36:49.641 --> 36:50.974
for the listening party.

36:50.976 --> 36:53.210
I know my energy
may be low right now.

36:53.212 --> 36:54.844
-It's really low.

36:54.846 --> 36:57.614
Like, I know just watching this,
this isn't you.

36:57.616 --> 37:01.017
This isn't the la'britney
that I know you can give me.

37:01.019 --> 37:03.420
-I'm trying to focus, you know,
but I just feel like

37:03.422 --> 37:05.989
there's so many things
pulling my focus right now.

37:05.991 --> 37:08.058
-It doesn't look like you
about to be ready

37:08.060 --> 37:09.960
for a listening party
in three days.

37:09.962 --> 37:12.762
Like, do we need to postpone it?

37:12.764 --> 37:14.464
-[sighs]
-'cause this la'britney that

37:14.466 --> 37:18.268
I just saw isn't
the la'britney that I know.

37:18.270 --> 37:21.271
-As much as I'm stressed out
about finding a home,

37:21.273 --> 37:24.040
if I have his listening party
and I don't do well,

37:24.042 --> 37:26.409
then I'll probably be
on a plane back to detroit

37:26.411 --> 37:29.512
because the whole point is
for me to have my family here

37:29.514 --> 37:32.015
and take my career
to the next level.

37:32.017 --> 37:34.017
-Let me go get hollywood.

37:37.522 --> 37:39.289
Hollywood.
-Hey, hey.

37:39.291 --> 37:41.424
-Hey.

37:41.426 --> 37:45.061
-What you got going on?

37:45.063 --> 37:46.429
-I need a break.

37:46.431 --> 37:48.431
-From?
-Today.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.133
-Wait, what do you mean?
-I just need a breather. I --

37:50.135 --> 37:52.502
-well, you're breathing now.
-No, I got to go.

37:52.504 --> 37:53.637
-Wait, hold on..

37:53.639 --> 37:55.105
-I'll call you tomorrow,
hollywood.

37:55.107 --> 37:57.641
-I'm telling you,
you don't see beyoncé

37:57.643 --> 37:59.342
asking for breaks.
-Don't get fired, hollywood!

37:59.344 --> 38:01.144
-Okay.

38:03.615 --> 38:07.384
Asking for breaks.
-Dowe might just get out ♪d!

38:07.386 --> 38:10.854
♪ smoke rings around
feel like a halo ♪

38:10.856 --> 38:14.791
♪ hope you didn't come here
to lay low ♪

38:14.793 --> 38:17.627
-toni has set up this
coffee date for mehgan and I.

38:17.629 --> 38:20.897
I'm hoping that she has
her big-girl boots on

38:20.899 --> 38:22.666
and she wants to sit down
like a woman.

38:22.668 --> 38:24.401
I just really hope that she's
not on some more

38:24.403 --> 38:25.802
young, messy (bleep)

38:25.804 --> 38:28.238
'cause I really
don't have time for that.

38:31.243 --> 38:33.443
-The only reason I'm willing
to meet up with stormey

38:33.445 --> 38:35.979
to talk about what happened
is because toni's my girl,

38:35.981 --> 38:39.582
and if toni's vouching,
then I guess I should go.

38:39.584 --> 38:40.917
If this isn't squashed,

38:40.919 --> 38:44.120
then they'll never
see me again, so...

38:44.122 --> 38:46.156
-Hello.
-Hey. How are you?

38:46.158 --> 38:49.225
-Good. How are you?
-I'm good.

38:49.227 --> 38:51.828
-Did you want anything?

38:53.965 --> 38:55.865
-So, um, I talked to tonesa,

38:55.867 --> 38:58.702
and, um, the reason I didn't
come to the cooking night

38:58.704 --> 39:02.339
is because, like, I didn't want
to be, like, "fake" per se,

39:02.341 --> 39:04.007
'cause I feel like you and I
didn't really get

39:04.009 --> 39:05.775
to have a conversation about

39:05.777 --> 39:08.345
what transpired
at your pool party.

39:08.347 --> 39:11.581
And I felt uncomfortable
coming to your home

39:11.583 --> 39:14.417
with, like, any, like, tension.

39:14.419 --> 39:16.720
-Yeah, but you were invited.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.555
And the thing is,
I had already talked to tonesa

39:18.557 --> 39:21.324
and was like,
"it was a misunderstanding."

39:21.326 --> 39:22.926
-yeah, but I just wanted
to talk to you about it,

39:22.928 --> 39:25.595
'cause it really hurt
my feelings

39:25.597 --> 39:27.030
the way that it happened.

39:27.032 --> 39:28.898
Like, I felt like you were
really disrespectful.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.801
And I also felt like the way
that you handled it,

39:31.803 --> 39:34.037
like, I kind of felt attacked.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.872
-No, I don't feel where
mehgan's coming from.

39:35.874 --> 39:38.508
What disrespect?
Disrespect who?

39:38.510 --> 39:40.143
What? Man, please.

39:40.145 --> 39:43.146
Well, I felt attacked,
and I felt like I was cornered.

39:43.148 --> 39:44.681
I wanted to pull toni
to the side.

39:44.683 --> 39:46.449
And the next thing you know,
you came in and sat down

39:46.451 --> 39:48.385
and said "beef," and I'm like,

39:48.387 --> 39:49.886
"I don't think
she really understands

39:49.888 --> 39:51.521
what beef means to me,"
you know what I mean?

39:51.523 --> 39:53.256
And that's why I reacted
the way I did,

39:53.258 --> 39:54.924
because it really pissed me off.

39:54.926 --> 39:57.394
I never told her
toni and I had beef.

39:57.396 --> 39:59.396
When you see somebody,
when you got beef with them,

39:59.398 --> 40:01.664
you taking off on sight.
That's beef for me.

40:01.666 --> 40:03.166
You know,
we don't exchange words.

40:03.168 --> 40:05.168
I don't know what beef
may mean to mehgan,

40:05.170 --> 40:07.704
but I think she was
just being real messy.

40:07.706 --> 40:09.038
-Obviously, like,
we were born in, like,

40:09.040 --> 40:10.540
two different generations.

40:10.542 --> 40:11.875
-Did she say that?

40:11.877 --> 40:13.476
-Maybe there's, like,
communication issues.

40:13.478 --> 40:15.111
I didn't mean it in that way,
like, oh, you wanted

40:15.113 --> 40:16.379
to fight her or nothing.

40:16.381 --> 40:17.947
I was just like,
"so y'all beef squashed?"

40:17.949 --> 40:19.416
like, that's how I talk.

40:19.418 --> 40:21.484
Clearly, I'm about 14 years
younger than stormey.

40:21.486 --> 40:23.019
And my definition of beef

40:23.021 --> 40:25.021
is clearly not
her definition of beef.

40:25.023 --> 40:27.624
Maybe it's a generational thing.
I don't know.

40:27.626 --> 40:30.593
Point blank, period,
the lady is old.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.061
-And I realize that.

40:32.063 --> 40:33.963
Once when everything was
going on, somebody was like,

40:33.965 --> 40:35.632
"she didn't mean it like that,"
and I'm just --

40:35.634 --> 40:38.301
but I was already in the moment,
you know what I mean?

40:38.303 --> 40:40.737
I apologize
if I was overly aggressive,

40:40.739 --> 40:42.138
you know what I mean?

40:42.140 --> 40:44.774
Um, I know that I have
a tendency to blow up,

40:44.776 --> 40:46.810
and I am trying to help --
you know, work on that,

40:46.812 --> 40:49.813
because that's not
how I should be acting.

40:49.815 --> 40:51.181
I don't see any reason

40:51.183 --> 40:53.283
in holding on to grudges
at this point in my life.

40:53.285 --> 40:56.186
Now, I'm not sorry,
but it's an apology.

40:56.188 --> 40:58.021
So, you know, just know
the difference and just know

40:58.023 --> 40:59.656
that I know
how to move on from things.

40:59.658 --> 41:01.357
I'm ready to move on from it,
though.

41:01.359 --> 41:02.892
-Me, too.
-Well, I'm glad that we were

41:02.894 --> 41:04.627
able to talk this out as women.

41:04.629 --> 41:06.963
-I'm not surprised that stormey
apologized to me.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.198
She was wrong.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.999
I'm not really big
on second chances,

41:10.001 --> 41:11.668
but since this is t's girl

41:11.670 --> 41:13.503
and I'm just getting to know
these ladies,

41:13.505 --> 41:15.939
we don't know each other well,
I'm willing to give it a shot.

41:15.941 --> 41:18.141
But, bitch, I got my eye on you.

41:20.111 --> 41:22.879
-Next time
on "notorious queens"...

41:22.881 --> 41:25.081
-Where my man at?
<i> -Well, I will say</i>

41:25.083 --> 41:28.151
<i> I've come across an obstacle.</i>
-An obstacle?

41:28.153 --> 41:32.155
<i> -He has a kid.</i>
-Oh, my god, girl.

41:32.157 --> 41:36.159
-"after spending some 800 or so
odd nights in federal prison,

41:36.161 --> 41:37.961
it was about time
I pay for the dirt

41:37.963 --> 41:39.362
I've done in my life."

41:39.364 --> 41:42.432
for a woman who has sold drugs,

41:42.434 --> 41:45.502
you wouldn't think reading
a book would be this scary.

41:45.504 --> 41:48.071
But let me tell you, it is.

41:48.073 --> 41:49.739
-Oh, it's about to go down,
girl.

41:49.741 --> 41:52.175
-Yes!
-Yes!

41:52.177 --> 41:55.478
[cheering]

41:55.480 --> 41:57.847
-try to get -- can you get
your leg a little bit higher?

41:57.849 --> 41:59.549
There you go. There you go.

41:59.551 --> 42:02.285
Now rotate forward.
There it is!
