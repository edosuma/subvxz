(CHEERING)

01:00.440 --> 01:03.280
(CHEERING)

01:03.320 --> 01:06.520
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much, everyone.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.040
Hello.

01:08.080 --> 01:10.080
Hello, everyone!

01:10.120 --> 01:11.600
Thank you.

01:11.640 --> 01:14.360
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you so much.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.440
Thank you.

01:17.160 --> 01:22.120
Thank you so much.
Welcome, and Happy Christmas.

01:22.160 --> 01:26.240
And in this show,
which has a tree over there,

01:26.280 --> 01:29.240
and nothing else festive
at all...

01:29.280 --> 01:34.440
I drive the Bugatti Chiron
in Saint-Tropez.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.600
And in the Alps.

01:38.520 --> 01:42.640
And through the streets
of Turin.

01:42.680 --> 01:47.520
But we start with James May, who
has been driving
a Kia hatchback.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.720
(LAUGHTER)

01:49.760 --> 01:52.760
So, he drives around
the best bits of Europe in
a Bugatti and you get a Kia!

01:52.800 --> 01:54.840
You can shut up, Hammond,

01:54.880 --> 01:56.960
because,
if you remember rightly,

01:57.000 --> 01:59.320
you were supposed to go
and drive the Kia hatchback,

01:59.360 --> 02:02.440
but you couldn't,
because you can't drive round
corners without crashing.

02:02.480 --> 02:03.560
Oh, yeah.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.800
-Were you his stand-in?
-Yes.

02:05.840 --> 02:09.400
-Has he said "thank you"?
-No, he hasn't, actually.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.080
That's unbelievably selfish. You
should have done, really.

02:11.120 --> 02:13.360
-Well, I'd broken my leg! -Well,
don't go on about it.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.880
That's all we hear: "I broke my
leg! I broke my leg!"

02:15.920 --> 02:17.440
(LAUGHTER)

02:17.480 --> 02:19.520
It doesn't matter,
because the Kia hatchback

02:19.560 --> 02:21.560
that Hammond should have been
driving, but wasn't,

02:21.600 --> 02:23.680
turns out to be not as boring as
you might expect,

02:23.720 --> 02:25.720
as I shall now explain.

02:28.280 --> 02:31.120
To do my explaining,
I've come here,

02:31.160 --> 02:34.960
to the sunny Balearic island of
Majorca,

02:35.000 --> 02:37.880
where we find this.

02:41.000 --> 02:46.920
Kia's first attempt to make
a saloon car that's sporty,
rather than sensible.

02:49.320 --> 02:53.200
It even has a cool name.
It's called the Stinger.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.240
Check this out.

02:58.280 --> 03:00.760
This
is the little keyless fob
that locks and unlocks it,

03:00.800 --> 03:05.720
and you could see that
as the button
that launches a missile.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.080
-(IMMOBILISER BEEPS)
-To the Stinger.

03:09.640 --> 03:11.200
(ENGINE ROARING)

03:11.240 --> 03:13.680
Besides a key
from Fighter Command,

03:13.720 --> 03:18.920
the Stinger has other things
designed to give you
the fizz.

03:18.960 --> 03:23.760
Power, for example. This has a
3.3-litre twin-turbo V6,

03:23.800 --> 03:26.240
developing 365 horsepower.

03:26.280 --> 03:30.440
Now, that's not Vindaloo-hot,
like a BMW M3.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.760
It's more Madras-hot,
I think.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.800
Say an Audi S4.

03:37.360 --> 03:38.880
And if you're watching
in America,

03:38.920 --> 03:42.320
I'm using here the car-curry
performance index.

03:42.360 --> 03:44.000
Very popular in Britain.

03:47.040 --> 03:52.200
If you prefer numbers,
it does 0 to 60
in around five seconds.

03:52.240 --> 03:56.520
And it has a top speed just
short of 170 miles an hour.

03:58.240 --> 04:01.960
So, again, that's not as fast as
a BMW M3,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.160
but it's probably fast enough to
outrun

04:04.200 --> 04:07.760
one of Kim Jong-un's
wonky northern missiles.

04:14.080 --> 04:17.040
And there's more
sporty stuff.

04:17.080 --> 04:20.520
I have an eight-speed,
semi-automatic gearbox,

04:20.560 --> 04:22.520
which I can control
with paddles,

04:22.560 --> 04:26.600
and that most important
of sports-saloon requirements:

04:26.640 --> 04:28.200
rear-wheel drive.

04:29.800 --> 04:33.480
It's also groaning
with equipment.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.520
I'll run you through
just a few of the things.

04:35.560 --> 04:39.080
I've got a 15-speaker stereo.
I've got a head-up display,

04:39.120 --> 04:41.080
adaptive cruise control,

04:41.120 --> 04:43.080
collision warning system,

04:43.120 --> 04:46.080
driver-drowsiness
warning system.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.560
Very useful
when I'm on board.

04:49.040 --> 04:52.240
All of this in a car
costing around Â£40,000,

04:52.280 --> 04:57.240
which makes it Â£5,000 less than
the equivalent Jag
or Audi.

05:00.440 --> 05:03.320
But never mind
the not unreasonable price.

05:03.360 --> 05:08.600
The Stinger's main purpose
is to show that Kia
can make a sporty saloon.

05:08.640 --> 05:13.040
So, to find out
if they've succeeded, we need
to do something sporty.

05:16.720 --> 05:18.320
Which brings me here.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.920
To this road.

05:20.960 --> 05:24.920
A challenging five-kilometre
scribble of Tarmac,

05:24.960 --> 05:30.360
spearing and snaking up through
the Majorcan hills.

05:30.400 --> 05:35.280
What I intend to do
is start down there
and drive as fast as possible

05:35.320 --> 05:39.240
to a finishing point
here on this bridge.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.520
And to spice it up,
I'm making it a race.

05:41.560 --> 05:47.520
It's me and the Stinger versus
some young men
on planks.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.520
Here's one of them,
and here's the other one.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.600
They both dress
like bike racers,
but their preferred transport

05:53.640 --> 05:57.440
is specially modified
skateboards,

05:57.480 --> 06:01.280
which hardly sounds like much
of a threat to the car.

06:04.880 --> 06:06.480
OK. Tell us
about those skateboards.

06:06.520 --> 06:09.000
What, sort of bicycle speeds?
20, 30?

06:09.040 --> 06:12.520
The fastest we can go
is 75 miles an hour. 120K.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.400
75 miles an hour?

06:17.280 --> 06:18.680
On that?

06:18.720 --> 06:20.560
Do you mind if I...?

06:20.600 --> 06:23.240
Yeah. Knock yourself out.
Not literally.

06:23.280 --> 06:27.280
75 miles an hour
on a piece of wood with some
plastic wheels on it?

06:27.320 --> 06:29.520
-You're mad.
-(CHUCKLES)

06:29.560 --> 06:31.480
Right. Just so we're clear
on the rules,

06:31.520 --> 06:34.320
I'm going to start down there at
the start line

06:34.360 --> 06:37.360
and drive uphill
all the way to here,
which is the finish line,

06:37.400 --> 06:40.720
while you start here on
what is my finish line, but is
actually your start line,

06:40.760 --> 06:42.960
and you're downhill
all the way.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.960
So, if you see "finish" upside
down,
you're at the start,

06:46.000 --> 06:48.360
but "start" the right way up,
you're at your start.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.200
And when I see "start"
upside down, it's your start,
but it's my finish,

06:51.240 --> 06:53.520
cos it says "finish"
the right way up.

06:53.560 --> 06:56.000
There's a point
where we cross over, obviously,
so be careful.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.080
Let's just agree: stay right if
we see each other?

06:59.120 --> 07:01.320
Your right or our right?

07:01.360 --> 07:03.320
Well, it's the same thing, cos
you're going
the other way, downhill,

07:03.360 --> 07:05.080
and I'm going uphill
towards this finish.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.600
OK.

07:06.640 --> 07:09.560
No. Yeah. No, the left.
No, just stay... Yeah.

07:13.560 --> 07:18.320
Soon we were in position
at our respective start/finish
lines.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.400
Right. Setup.

07:22.440 --> 07:25.920
We're going to go
for the sportiest mode,
which is Sport Plus.

07:25.960 --> 07:29.680
Traction & Stability Control
disabled.
That's all the nannies off.

07:29.720 --> 07:33.160
It is a hill climb.
Don't bin it, May.

07:33.200 --> 07:36.360
Here we go.
Horsepower versus gravity.

07:36.400 --> 07:40.440
Isaac Newton and dudes
versus South Korea and me.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.360
Keep the foot in. Yes.

07:59.120 --> 08:02.640
Throttle response
a bit more chippy when you've
got it on Sport Plus.

08:06.440 --> 08:07.680
(TYRES SQUEALING)

08:07.720 --> 08:09.800
Yes. Little bit
of sideways action.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.720
I've got a limited-slip diff.
That's going
to look after me.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.600
Brake. Turn it.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.680
On the exit. There it is.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.040
(TYRES SQUEALING)

08:32.080 --> 08:36.000
Oh, those rocks
don't look nice! Aaaarghh!

08:42.720 --> 08:44.320
Easy right,
then a bit of a left.

08:44.360 --> 08:45.600
(TYRES SQUEALING)

08:51.400 --> 08:54.320
Here they come. Keep right!

08:55.600 --> 08:58.640
Jeez, those guys are going!

08:58.680 --> 09:02.240
And for them,
the remaining course
was full of fast straights,

09:04.280 --> 09:08.760
whereas, for me, the road
was now becoming twistier.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.840
(TYRES SQUEALING)

09:15.480 --> 09:18.320
Stay out, stay out, stay out.
Mind the rocks.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.960
Apex. See the exit.
Squares it. That's lovely!

09:31.760 --> 09:33.600
Yes, there's the bridge.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.960
Here I come! Here I come! Don't
bin it now.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.680
Aaaarghh!

09:48.600 --> 09:51.000
Yes! Yes.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.600
Right. Let's have it.

09:53.640 --> 09:56.120
-Yeah, buddy.
-Yeah, buddy.

10:00.200 --> 10:05.080
MAN: OK, James.
The boarders did it in five
minutes and 16 seconds.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.800
You did it in five minutes and
ten seconds.

10:08.840 --> 10:12.080
Yes! Yes! Yes!

10:15.000 --> 10:17.640
(BELLOWING) Losers!

10:17.680 --> 10:20.360
Losers! Losers!

10:20.400 --> 10:22.240
Whatever.
(BLEEP) ...that guy.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.560
-(CHEERING)
-Bad winner.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.320
-He's a bad winner.
-Yeah, exactly.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.600
Appalling.

10:30.640 --> 10:31.920
Yep.

10:33.480 --> 10:35.960
Standard reaction
from James May.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.440
James, I am very curious.

10:38.480 --> 10:42.800
How did you manage
to go to Majorca in all
that beautiful sunshine

10:42.840 --> 10:44.560
and not catch pneumonia?

10:44.600 --> 10:47.360
-(LAUGHTER)
-Well, I mean, it's a danger.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.120
No, it's funny you should ask,
but actually, I did go

10:49.160 --> 10:51.240
past a lot of places
that sold pneumonia.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.080
(LAUGHTER)

10:53.120 --> 10:54.560
But I didn't go in
because I had to get up

10:54.600 --> 10:57.240
the next day early
and go to work.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.920
Let's move on,
because it is now time

10:58.960 --> 11:04.200
for us to peer
down a manhole of chat
on Conversation Street.

11:05.880 --> 11:07.720
(MODERN JAZZ)

11:09.920 --> 11:11.560
(CHEERING)

11:11.600 --> 11:16.080
That's festive.
The tree and that.

11:16.120 --> 11:20.440
And I think we should do
more festive stuff now.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.480
-Yes.
-And turn on the lights

11:22.520 --> 11:25.080
on our motoring-flavoured tree.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.760
Yes, and I'd like to go first,
if I turn on the lights I've
made

11:27.800 --> 11:29.960
using the back lights
from various cars.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.360
Look. That's Christmassy, isn't
it? Ahh!

11:33.400 --> 11:36.560
I'd like to add my lights
to the festive tree, which I've
made out of indicators.

11:36.600 --> 11:39.600
So, they're orange and
they flash, and they're warm.
Are you ready?

11:39.640 --> 11:42.240
-Oh, Christmassy!
-How about that, then?

11:42.280 --> 11:43.800
-Right...
-No!

11:43.840 --> 11:45.120
Why not?

11:45.160 --> 11:46.600
Do not switch on
whatever you've made.

11:46.640 --> 11:49.280
-Why?
-Because you'll blind
everybody in the tent.

11:49.320 --> 11:51.280
Why do you always think
I'll have overdone it?

11:51.320 --> 11:53.320
Because you always overdo it.

11:53.360 --> 11:57.000
-Ready?
-Oh, dear God!

11:57.040 --> 11:58.640
What do you think of that?
Why are you grimacing?

11:58.680 --> 12:00.320
-(APPLAUSE)
-Don't encourage him.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.560
What? It's brilliant.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.480
It's a bit bright,
I admit, but...

12:07.520 --> 12:09.640
It is bright. You've burnt
people's eyes out.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.880
-Why is it a cross?
-It's the baby Jesus.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.040
(LAUGHTER)

12:14.080 --> 12:15.560
It's the baby Jesus,
not the dead Jesus.

12:17.240 --> 12:18.920
What?

12:18.960 --> 12:21.320
The cross is what he was
crucified on. That's Easter.

12:21.360 --> 12:22.440
Oh.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.720
(LAUGHTER)

12:23.760 --> 12:25.440
So, what should it be
at Christmas?

12:25.480 --> 12:26.960
A star.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.320
-That's Jewish.
-No.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.520
It is.
Jews don't do Christmas.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.680
It's a different sort
of star.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.240
You've used
the wrong religious symbol.

12:36.560 --> 12:38.320
What that is
is a big spoiler alert.

12:38.360 --> 12:39.680
-(LAUGHTER)
-Yes.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.760
It is, yeah!

12:42.800 --> 12:44.880
-I've given away the ending?
-Yeah.

12:44.920 --> 12:49.080
If you don't want to know what
happens to the baby Jesus later,
look away now.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.920
Last year we looked
at all the motoring-related
Christmas presents

12:51.960 --> 12:53.640
you could buy,
and they were all terrible.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.800
In fact,
they always are terrible.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.640
Actually, the most terrible of
them all I've got in here. It's
Scalextric.

12:58.680 --> 13:01.040
-Oh, come on.
-What do you mean?

13:01.080 --> 13:03.040
-Well, I like Scalextric.
-Ah, you're wrong.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.840
-No, you are wrong.
-How could I be wrong
about what I'm like?

13:04.880 --> 13:06.680
-You don't like it.
-You think you like it.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.840
-I do.
-It's like classical music.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.880
People think they like classical
music, but they don't. Nobody
does, really.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.480
I do.

13:13.520 --> 13:16.440
Anyway, back to Scalextric,
which nobody likes, OK?

13:16.480 --> 13:20.640
The Professor
of Sweeping Statements!

13:20.680 --> 13:22.800
Let me explain
the problem, okay?
This is how Scalextric works.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.520
You take out the car.
"Wow!" you think.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.480
"Look at that.
It's like a Dodge Viper."

13:26.520 --> 13:28.480
And then throw it
under some furniture.

13:28.520 --> 13:30.400
And you have just
played Scalextric.

13:30.440 --> 13:33.720
Cos that's what happens
immediately with Scalextric.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.920
No, you get your
little sister to pick it up.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.440
Scalextric should come with
a little sister. Mine did.

13:38.480 --> 13:42.280
No, no. No, it shouldn't come
with a little sister.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.240
It did.

13:44.280 --> 13:47.440
-Did you say that out loud?
-Yeah, he did.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.280
I was hoping
to just carry on.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.200
My sister's 12 years younger.
The year I got my Scalextric,

13:51.240 --> 13:52.800
I also got a little sister.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.160
Don't disillusion him of it!

13:56.200 --> 13:57.840
He thinks
that's where they come from.

13:59.760 --> 14:02.800
-It came from Hornby Hobbies.
-It shouldn't arrive at all!

14:02.840 --> 14:04.880
Two things
are going to happen.

14:04.920 --> 14:08.160
Either you go too fast,
in which case
the car goes under furniture,

14:08.200 --> 14:11.640
or you get the speed right and
it just goes round
and round

14:11.680 --> 14:13.840
and round and round,
for ever.

14:13.880 --> 14:17.240
Yes, you find the speed
at which the cars don't come off
and then just watch them.

14:17.280 --> 14:20.800
What you're doing
at that point is watching
electricity happen.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.480
-Yes.
-(LAUGHTER)

14:22.520 --> 14:24.560
I can see why you were
disappointed, Hammond.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.800
You put an electric car
on a race track

14:25.840 --> 14:26.880
and, next thing you know,
you've crashed.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.800
(LAUGHTER)

14:28.840 --> 14:31.640
(APPLAUSE)

14:31.680 --> 14:33.320
Sorry. That was a bit...

14:33.360 --> 14:36.880
That was... (GROANS)

14:36.920 --> 14:39.760
That wasn't even in the back.
That was in the face!

14:41.480 --> 14:46.680
I have got some Bentley...
espresso cups and saucers.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.600
(LAUGHTER)

14:48.640 --> 14:51.160
-What do you think of that? -No,
no, I quite like those.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.080
-The colours...
-They're horrible.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.160
-They're too thick.
-Ah, they're not,

14:55.200 --> 14:57.120
cos espresso cups
have to be thick.

14:57.160 --> 15:00.160
They have to weigh
147.8 grams.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.800
-Says who?
-Italian coffee scientists.

15:02.840 --> 15:05.720
-That's a fact.
-That is pretentious twaddle.

15:05.760 --> 15:07.920
-It isn't.
-Just try it in a restaurant.

15:07.960 --> 15:10.320
Call the waiter over.
"Come here, my man. Ahem.

15:10.360 --> 15:14.680
I think you know
what I'm going to tell you
about this cup.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.200
It's too heavy."

15:16.240 --> 15:19.600
-But it isn't too heavy.
-It is. It's too thick.

15:19.640 --> 15:21.440
It could be hit with a hammer
and survive.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.000
What, and that's a bad thing?

15:23.040 --> 15:24.480
Oh,
don't hit it with a hammer.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.960
-(LAUGHTER)
-I was wrong.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.880
I was actually going
to take those home.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.920
Ah, you can. You can, actually.
There you go.

15:33.960 --> 15:37.720
There's your set
of three Bentley
espresso cups and saucers.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.160
And you get a spare saucer,
in case you break one.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.640
It's nice. Spare.
It's a good present, that.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.600
I have actually got you
a present, Hammond.

15:44.640 --> 15:47.120
-Have you?
-It's in a presentation box.
Here it is.

15:47.160 --> 15:51.680
The box is broken,
and I apologise for that, but
there it is. Check it out.

15:51.720 --> 15:54.360
It's a ruined watch.

15:54.400 --> 15:57.080
Not just any ruined watch. It's
your ruined watch.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.240
-Is it?
-That has been retrieved

15:59.280 --> 16:02.080
from the wreckage of the car
that you destroyed,
with your incompetence,

16:02.120 --> 16:04.240
and that survived the fire.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.520
It's actually still...
It doesn't look pretty,
but it's still working.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.800
Well, that's actually
quite a nice present,
in a way, isn't it?

16:09.840 --> 16:11.920
Exactly, and they've written a
little thing on the box.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.920
"Made in Switzerland,"

16:13.960 --> 16:18.120
and then, "Carefully perfected
on 10th June 2017

16:18.160 --> 16:19.560
by the British."

16:19.600 --> 16:21.480
(LAUGHTER)

16:21.520 --> 16:23.440
They don't mean "perfected", do
they?

16:23.480 --> 16:25.120
No, and by "British"
they mean you.

16:25.160 --> 16:28.320
Yeah. It's actually quite
a mean present, after all.

16:28.360 --> 16:30.160
Well, look, Hammond.
I've got you something.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.800
I have got you
a pair of running shoes,

16:32.840 --> 16:36.200
and I've added to them
the logo of your favourite local
car maker,

16:36.240 --> 16:38.000
and you can't say
you don't like that.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.080
You love running.
You go running every morning.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.520
I've seen you go running
in the evening, as well.

16:41.560 --> 16:46.080
-I cannot wear those.
-(LAUGHTER)

16:47.560 --> 16:49.280
Why not?

16:49.320 --> 16:52.680
Because I'm not allowed to run
any more. I broke my leg.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.640
Oh, stop going on about it!

16:54.680 --> 16:58.240
It's all he talks about:
"I broke my leg!
I broke my leg!"

16:58.280 --> 17:02.160
We brought you those presents.
Two of them.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.040
I've got you
another present here.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.640
Look at that. An alarm clock.

17:06.680 --> 17:09.320
Made it myself.
It's beautifully styled.

17:09.360 --> 17:11.440
Oh, funny.
It's crashed. I see. Ha-ha.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.360
Yeah,
it's a crashed car on top.
That's why it's yours.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.000
Right,
I'm just setting it now.
Now, pretend to be asleep.

17:16.040 --> 17:18.920
-What? Oh, all right.
-Just pretend to be asleep.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.520
This
is on your bedside table.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.440
Yes, OK. I'm asleep.

17:24.760 --> 17:26.560
-(BEEPING)
-There it is.

17:26.600 --> 17:27.840
Christ!

17:27.880 --> 17:31.440
-It's going off.
-(APPLAUSE)

17:31.480 --> 17:33.280
-That's my alarm?
-Yes.

17:34.440 --> 17:36.800
-Well, that's--
-Come on!

17:36.840 --> 17:42.600
I can't have that. That'll...
That'll just set fire...

17:42.640 --> 17:45.560
-Haven't got my glasses.
-That'll just set fire
to everything on my--

17:45.600 --> 17:48.480
-Sorry.
-Oh, God!

17:48.520 --> 17:51.640
It's not me
that's on fire this time!

17:51.680 --> 17:53.920
I missed.
I haven't got my glasses.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.600
I can't wake up
to that every morning.

17:55.640 --> 17:57.320
When you're driving along
and your car catches fire,

17:57.360 --> 17:59.240
which it will,
cos you'll have crashed it...

17:59.280 --> 18:01.080
-(LAUGHTER)
-...you'll be used to it,

18:01.120 --> 18:03.440
cos you'll have to put
a fire out every morning.

18:03.480 --> 18:06.960
Yes, I won't have slept
for a year, waiting for an
explosion next to my bed...

18:07.000 --> 18:09.160
Stop moaning about all
the presents we've given you!

18:09.200 --> 18:10.840
It's traumatising!

18:10.880 --> 18:14.440
Look. I have bought you
a pair of trousers.

18:14.480 --> 18:17.200
-There you go.
-What? Oh, thank you, James.
Very nice.

18:17.240 --> 18:19.160
Not just any old trousers.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.000
No, they've got Velcro
on them. What's that about?

18:22.040 --> 18:24.560
Well, it means
the paramedics won't have
to cut your clothes off you.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.440
(LAUGHTER)

18:26.480 --> 18:28.560
And you'll save a fortune over
the coming year,
you see?

18:28.600 --> 18:29.560
(APPLAUSE)

18:40.280 --> 18:43.040
-Have you got us anything? -No.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.760
-(LAUGHTER)
-Not a thing?

18:44.800 --> 18:47.080
Well, I didn't know
we were doing this.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.840
What do you mean? You didn't
know it was Christmas?
It's in your diary.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.040
It's in everybody's diary.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.760
It's not like Easter,
moving around.
It's the same day every year.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.520
Every single year.

18:55.560 --> 18:57.120
You could have sent a memo,
saying we're doing presents.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.840
-Unbelievable.
-(LAUGHTER)

18:59.880 --> 19:02.200
Anyway, Jeremy Clarkson...

19:02.240 --> 19:04.800
Not everybody
is as thoughtless
as Richard Hammond.

19:04.840 --> 19:07.560
I'm certainly not, and I have
bought you a present.

19:07.600 --> 19:11.240
-Oh, thank you, James.
-It's the season
of goodwill to all men.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.280
Even if you hate them.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.160
(LAUGHTER)

19:18.480 --> 19:21.480
I have got you,
for Christmas, a T-shirt.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.040
-Are they my lungs?
-Yes, they are.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.760
(LAUGHTER)

19:26.800 --> 19:29.040
That was when I... It is.

19:29.080 --> 19:34.640
A lot of work went into this,
cos I had to ring up
the hospital in Majorca,

19:34.680 --> 19:38.880
and I asked the barman... Sorry,
the doctor.

19:38.920 --> 19:42.040
...for a copy of the scan
of your lungs, and
I printed it on the T-shirt.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.880
-And this bit, this is the...
-That was the pneumonia?

19:44.920 --> 19:47.440
Yeah, that's the bit where your
lungs were infected.

19:47.480 --> 19:50.840
I've coloured that in pink, you
know, to show your favourite
type of pneumonia.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.560
(LAUGHTER)

19:52.600 --> 19:56.080
-Is that... Are they bubbles?
-Yes.

19:56.120 --> 19:58.680
James, I don't drink Prosecco.
I'm not a girl.

19:58.720 --> 20:02.360
Oh, no, of course. You're
the Viking Jeremy Clarkson,

20:02.400 --> 20:06.240
with his still pink wine, which
you drink
out of a hollow horn.

20:06.280 --> 20:09.560
All real men drink rosÃ©.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.400
Thank you, James.
That is a thoughtful gift
and I shall treasure it.

20:12.440 --> 20:15.280
-No, it's OK, Jeremy.
-(LAUGHTER)

20:15.320 --> 20:17.560
There is as much pleasure
in giving as in receiving.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.720
-(LAUGHTER)
-I suspect more...

20:19.760 --> 20:22.040
Leave it! Leave it.

20:23.680 --> 20:26.480
-Leave that where it is.
-Yeah.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.120
I've got you
a properly brilliant present.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.000
-I can't wait.
-No, seriously.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.280
You know the problem with
trying to open a fridge door?

20:35.320 --> 20:38.080
-No, that's not a problem.
-Yes, it is. No, it is.

20:38.120 --> 20:39.840
No, you pull the thing
and, with my fridge,

20:39.880 --> 20:41.920
the seal is stronger than
the weight of the fridge,

20:41.960 --> 20:44.720
so you just end up
pulling the fridge
across the kitchen floor.

20:44.760 --> 20:46.320
No, that's because
you're an ape.

20:46.360 --> 20:49.360
The only way of opening
my fridge is to surprise it.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.120
-Surprise your fridge?
-You walk up to it backwards

20:51.160 --> 20:52.760
and then snatch it like that,

20:52.800 --> 20:54.920
because you have to yank it
really quickly.

20:54.960 --> 20:57.640
But I'm not joking.
The other day, I did that
and the fridge fell...

20:57.680 --> 20:59.680
Actually the whole thing
on top of me.

20:59.720 --> 21:01.400
Are you sure your fridge
doesn't have a push door?

21:04.000 --> 21:07.560
Anyway,
I've got you, James May...
It's a big present, this one.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.360
Right. Ready?
I've got you a fridge
with a motoring flavour,

21:11.400 --> 21:13.960
cos I put a steering wheel
on the door.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.200
So... OK, it's now shut, yes?

21:17.240 --> 21:18.800
RICHARD:
Oh, thank you very much.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.720
-(LAUGHTER)
-Relax. OK?

21:20.760 --> 21:23.360
-So, it won't open. Yes?
-Right.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.800
But then, if you turn this...
It's modelled
on a submarine door,

21:25.840 --> 21:28.760
cos it's important,
with a submarine, you know when
a door's open or shut.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.760
All the way over, and then
it opens. Can you see?

21:31.800 --> 21:34.200
-Yeah, I can see.
-Well, how brilliant's that?

21:34.240 --> 21:36.480
You've bought me a solution to a
problem only you have.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.200
(LAUGHTER)

21:38.240 --> 21:40.160
That is the worst Christmas
present I've ever had.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.400
It isn't. How can it be?
Why is it?

21:42.440 --> 21:44.600
-You've bought something
for yourself.
-No, you did that last year.

21:44.640 --> 21:48.200
You bought your girlfriend
a Ferrari that only you
were insured to drive.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.880
-(LAUGHTER)
-You did.

21:49.920 --> 21:53.480
"Oh, I bought you this," and
no-one else could drive it.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.520
-That's chivalry.
-Is it?

21:55.560 --> 21:58.440
Well, I think that's just been a
total disaster, Conversation
Street.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.320
-It was awful.
-He bought us nothing.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.400
-I bought you a present...
RICHARD: I'm sorry.

22:02.440 --> 22:05.440
Shut up. I made you presents
you don't like.

22:05.480 --> 22:08.040
No. All right. Let's move on.

22:08.080 --> 22:12.640
Now, have you ever wondered if
office lunch time
could be more interesting?

22:12.680 --> 22:15.880
-No, nobody's wondered that.
RICHARD: Well, we have...

22:15.920 --> 22:17.840
-(LAUGHTER)
-...which is why

22:17.880 --> 22:22.120
James and I decided to take the
Grand Tour to Dunstable.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.000
(LAUGHTER)

22:25.640 --> 22:27.640
RICHARD:
This is what we're on about.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.240
People in offices
all over the world

22:30.280 --> 22:32.320
just frittering away
their valuable lunch hours

22:32.360 --> 22:37.640
doing pointless things
on their phones
and eating plastic food.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.480
But not any more,

22:39.520 --> 22:42.240
because we're here
to literally save lunch times

22:42.280 --> 22:44.880
through the crucible
of motorsport.

22:44.920 --> 22:47.760
And you may be watching this and
thinking,
"Well, that's a great idea,

22:47.800 --> 22:49.480
but how do you get
all these people

22:49.520 --> 22:51.960
to a race track
during their lunch hour?"

22:52.000 --> 22:54.200
Well, the answer is,
we don't need to.

22:54.240 --> 22:58.160
The race track
is already here.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.880
JAMES: Yes, go to any business
park anywhere,

23:00.920 --> 23:04.520
and you'll find
long straights,
flowing roundabouts,

23:04.560 --> 23:06.800
sharp bends, the lot.

23:06.840 --> 23:10.280
There's a circuit to rival
Silverstone or Laguna Seca

23:10.320 --> 23:14.000
right outside
your office window.

23:14.040 --> 23:17.960
Today we've chosen
Houghton Hall Business Park
near Dunstable.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.520
So, let's see what kind
of track it can provide.

23:22.560 --> 23:25.120
This is
the Kia Picanto GT line,

23:25.160 --> 23:27.200
the hottest ship
in the Picanto range.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.800
-Is it?
-80 horsepower
from 1.25 litres.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.720
Yes,
just get in the bloody thing.

23:30.760 --> 23:33.920
-I'm saying a lot, cos it
takes him so long to get in.
-Shut up!

23:35.360 --> 23:38.000
So, what are we doing?

23:38.040 --> 23:41.600
We're going down the straight
towards the first roundabout,
which is Froughton's Haulage.

23:41.640 --> 23:44.920
I like the braking-distance
markers. That's a nice touch.
Very professional.

23:44.960 --> 23:51.080
This is the Whitbread, extremely
tight left-hander, and into Car
Park A.

23:51.120 --> 23:54.000
Now, there's a speed hump, and
then
the soon-to-be immortalised

23:54.040 --> 23:55.840
Smokers' Shelter complex.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.760
-Nice.
-Which is what we're in now.

23:57.800 --> 24:03.280
Dab of brakes. Apex it there,
and we're into Car Park B.

24:03.320 --> 24:05.280
This is Office Chair Bend. This
is the chicane...

24:05.320 --> 24:07.120
-Very nice.
-...before we go

24:07.160 --> 24:09.120
back onto the beginning
and ending straight

24:09.160 --> 24:11.640
and head towards Mannington
Plastics Roundabout.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.840
Leaders in injection-moulding
technology solutions.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.720
Excellent.
Quite the landmark.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.800
Keep it wide. Half-throttle.

24:17.840 --> 24:22.400
Look for the exit, and there we
are... across the line.

24:22.440 --> 24:24.640
Once you're across the line, you
can slow down.

24:24.680 --> 24:27.840
No point in continuing to go
fast, cos you could have
an accident doing that.

24:27.880 --> 24:28.800
Funny.

24:30.840 --> 24:34.000
RICHARD:
With the track signed off,
we selected two firms

24:34.040 --> 24:36.240
to go head-to-head
during their lunch hours.

24:37.880 --> 24:41.440
Today, the competitors
are Storage King,

24:41.480 --> 24:43.560
"Self-storage made simple",

24:43.600 --> 24:48.160
and Cura Technical,
"Leading providers
of IT support solutions".

24:48.200 --> 24:51.640
And once their contenders
had been selected,

24:51.680 --> 24:53.440
it was time
for the driver briefing.

24:55.600 --> 24:58.600
"Each entrant from each firm
does one timed lap.

24:58.640 --> 25:01.120
Using those lap times, we'll
whittle down our entrants,

25:01.160 --> 25:04.800
until we have the best driver
from each of the two firms."

25:04.840 --> 25:06.640
Hammond, everybody
in the room can read.

25:06.680 --> 25:09.680
Shut up.
"They'll then go head-to-head in
the grand final,

25:09.720 --> 25:12.840
to decide the ultimate winner of
today's round."

25:15.520 --> 25:17.680
JAMES: With Hammond's
presentation over,

25:17.720 --> 25:21.120
it was time to begin
the qualifying laps
that would decide

25:21.160 --> 25:25.880
which employees would represent
their firms in
the shoot-out grand finale.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.920
What we have first is
Pete from Cura Technical.

25:27.960 --> 25:31.200
He is the regional manager for
Bedfordshire
and the Midlands,

25:31.240 --> 25:33.680
in his Vauxhall SRI Astra.

25:33.720 --> 25:37.200
In three, two, one... go!

25:38.920 --> 25:42.480
RICHARD: As the regional manager
scorched away,

25:42.520 --> 25:44.560
I commandeered
the security hut,

25:44.600 --> 25:49.120
so that I could use
its CCTV feed
to commentate on the action.

25:49.160 --> 25:52.000
There's a complex of turns
through here,
really more than just one,

25:52.040 --> 25:54.920
and that speed hump to deal
with, as well. He's done that.
He is through.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.480
(TYRES SQUEALING)

25:57.520 --> 26:03.360
He's on his way through the
Office Chair complex. I can't
see him on that camera.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.480
Here he is. He's coming
back up the straight.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.680
200 brake horsepower.
Useful now.

26:07.720 --> 26:09.480
Going to make his way
towards Froughton Haulage,

26:09.520 --> 26:12.640
which is soon
to become the ending line.

26:12.680 --> 26:15.200
Huge amount of noise!
And across the line.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.400
(CHEERING)

26:17.440 --> 26:19.480
After a cracking
qualifying performance

26:19.520 --> 26:21.640
from Pete
of Cura Technical...

26:21.680 --> 26:24.720
1:06.16.

26:24.760 --> 26:28.080
...Storage King
sent out their first driver,

26:28.120 --> 26:31.600
hot-hatch enthusiast
Darren from logistics.

26:31.640 --> 26:33.400
Two, one... go!

26:35.240 --> 26:37.080
I do like a Clio.

26:38.240 --> 26:39.800
Oh, some sideways action.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.720
(TYRES SQUEALING)

26:41.760 --> 26:43.600
Oh, lovely work!

26:43.640 --> 26:47.240
By ragging his Clio
for all it was worth...

26:47.280 --> 26:49.160
(LAUGHING)

26:49.200 --> 26:52.720
...Storage King's Darren banged
in a scorcher
of a qualifier.

26:52.760 --> 26:54.840
Oh!

26:54.880 --> 26:58.200
-1:05.97.
-Oh, ho-ho!

26:58.240 --> 27:01.840
And now,
ladies and gentlemen,
from Cura Technical,

27:01.880 --> 27:03.560
it's Nick from Accounts,

27:03.600 --> 27:05.640
who will be looking to...
balance the books.

27:05.680 --> 27:08.040
Oh, God. He's making puns.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.280
In three, two, one!
And he's off!

27:12.760 --> 27:16.000
RICHARD: Despite being at the
wheel of a motorway cruiser,

27:16.040 --> 27:19.760
Nick seemed determined
to top the timing charts.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.680
Oh, this looks fast to me,
towards Smokers' Corner.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.040
However...

27:24.080 --> 27:26.120
And he's...
Yeah, that's looking...

27:26.160 --> 27:29.160
No, that's not under control,
because he's binned it!

27:29.200 --> 27:30.920
And he's binned it.

27:30.960 --> 27:34.200
He's binned it at Bin Corner,
appropriately enough.

27:34.240 --> 27:37.280
It is a DNF
for Nick from Accounts.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.520
The fleet manager
is not going to be pleased.

27:39.560 --> 27:43.480
There are going to be words
when he gets back
after lunch, I suspect.

27:46.240 --> 27:49.120
JAMES: With the lunch-hour clock
ticking away,

27:49.160 --> 27:51.920
there followed a final flurry
of qualifying laps.

27:53.440 --> 27:56.000
Three, two, one... go!

27:56.040 --> 27:59.360
Oh, it's a fizzy start
from the little Abarth.

28:00.960 --> 28:03.720
This is a tight little car, for
a small circuit.

28:03.760 --> 28:06.360
It's built for business-park
racing. Look at that!

28:06.400 --> 28:10.440
JAMES: It's Chris from Marketing
in the Toyota GT86.

28:16.160 --> 28:17.640
1:03.24.

28:20.720 --> 28:22.600
And then,
with the results in,

28:22.640 --> 28:26.400
it was time
for the grand-finale
showdown shoot-out.

28:26.440 --> 28:28.600
Now,
representing Storage King,

28:28.640 --> 28:30.560
in the Seat Leon Cupra R,

28:30.600 --> 28:33.120
-from Purchasing, it's Gav.
-(CHEERING)

28:36.360 --> 28:38.920
And representing
Cura Technical,

28:38.960 --> 28:42.560
in the BMW E90 M3,
from Sales,

28:42.600 --> 28:45.880
-give it up for Steve!
-(CHEERING)

28:45.920 --> 28:48.320
And since we are dealing
with the best

28:48.360 --> 28:50.320
that South Bedfordshire
has to offer:

28:50.360 --> 28:53.080
the crÃ¨me de menthe of
business-park driving talent,

28:53.120 --> 28:58.080
this final will be decided with
a straight
head-to-head race.

28:58.120 --> 29:04.880
OK. Here we go. Ready. Ready. In
three, two,

29:04.920 --> 29:06.320
one... Go!

29:06.360 --> 29:09.120
(TYRES SQUEALING)

29:09.160 --> 29:11.880
And there they go.
Steve against Gav,

29:11.920 --> 29:16.040
Sales against Purchasing,
battling down
the main straight.

29:16.080 --> 29:18.960
Froughton comes up first.
They're both through.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.120
They're both already
in Car Park A,
heading for Smokers' Corner.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.600
Oh,
he's gone very wide there.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.840
And the Seat is through.

29:30.880 --> 29:34.480
JAMES: The Seat is in front, but
not by much.

29:34.520 --> 29:36.480
RICHARD: I daren't watch. This
is tight.

29:36.520 --> 29:41.440
I would hate to have been having
a fag in that booth when they
came past.

29:41.480 --> 29:45.320
Car Park B coming up.
Look at this! Tailing one
another through there.

29:50.680 --> 29:53.640
I don't know how
these two companies get on.
Is there rivalry there?

29:53.680 --> 29:55.160
Are they getting something out
of their system?

29:57.960 --> 30:00.760
Already coming back up. Through
Froughton's
for the second time.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.360
These guys do mean business!

30:03.400 --> 30:06.000
-Half a car's length in it.
-Look at the speed
they're carrying!

30:08.640 --> 30:10.600
Oh! Close!

30:13.200 --> 30:17.120
Both of them now
up to Mannington's Plastics,
and it's really tight there.

30:23.400 --> 30:26.640
And across the line!
The BMW takes the flag.

30:26.680 --> 30:27.960
Yaaarghh!

30:29.880 --> 30:31.880
(LAUGHS)

30:31.920 --> 30:34.200
How about that?

30:40.280 --> 30:42.120
(CHEERING)

30:42.160 --> 30:46.360
Well, there we are. That's...
That's that all sorted out.

30:46.400 --> 30:49.840
And now it's time to sort
something else out, as well,

30:49.880 --> 30:53.360
as we play
Celebrity Face Off!

31:02.520 --> 31:04.400
(CHEERING)

31:06.560 --> 31:08.520
Once again...

31:08.560 --> 31:11.600
Once again,
it is an international event,

31:11.640 --> 31:14.000
Britain versus America.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.000
And the question is,
and it's a big one:

31:16.040 --> 31:18.960
who is the fastest person
in the world

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
who lives with a bear?

31:21.040 --> 31:25.160
To find out,
please welcome Casey Anderson
and Hugh Bonneville!

31:25.200 --> 31:27.040
(CHEERING)

31:30.120 --> 31:31.440
Gentlemen.

31:31.480 --> 31:33.200
-Hugh, have a seat.
-Thank you.

31:33.240 --> 31:35.400
Casey, have a seat.

31:35.440 --> 31:38.480
You go here - that one.
Yeah, you're that one.

31:42.440 --> 31:46.520
Thank you for coming.
First of all, I know you live
with a bear, obviously.

31:46.560 --> 31:48.560
-Obviously.
-But it's not a real bear.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.440
No,
Paddington's like a CGI bear.

31:51.480 --> 31:54.040
-(LAUGHTER)
-You may say that!

31:54.080 --> 31:57.160
And, Casey, you do live
with an actual bear.

31:57.200 --> 32:00.560
That's right, yeah.
Big bear. Like, 800 pounds.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.240
800 pounds?

32:02.280 --> 32:04.240
Yeah, 800 or 900 pounds,
depending on what he had
for dinner.

32:04.280 --> 32:06.280
(LAUGHTER)

32:06.320 --> 32:09.520
The thing is, you rescued this
bear when it was little, in
Montana.

32:09.560 --> 32:12.960
Yeah, he was literally
that big when I rescued him,
only a couple of months old,

32:13.000 --> 32:16.280
and now he's 15 years old,
stands about eight feet tall.

32:16.320 --> 32:19.160
But did you know
that was going to happen,
or were you surprised?

32:19.200 --> 32:21.280
"Jesus Christ!
Look at the size of it."

32:21.320 --> 32:23.600
Well, you have
this cute little bear
for a little while,

32:23.640 --> 32:26.520
and then all of a sudden,
he's ripping the couch up
and eating the cushions,

32:26.560 --> 32:28.440
trying to get in the
refrigerator for the beer.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.520
-You say he drinks beer? -Bears
love beer.

32:31.560 --> 32:34.840
Who'd have thought?
I mean, I remember one time just
cracking that open,

32:34.880 --> 32:36.680
and they have
an incredible sense of smell.

32:36.720 --> 32:39.120
Have we got a picture of him
drinking beer?

32:39.160 --> 32:41.400
(LAUGHTER)

32:41.440 --> 32:44.600
That's not Stella, I hope, cos
you don't want a bear
on Stella,

32:44.640 --> 32:47.240
or Wife-Beater,
as we call it over here.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.320
He doesn't live in a cage?

32:50.360 --> 32:52.920
No, he lives in the sanctuary
part of the time.

32:52.960 --> 32:55.440
He's at the house part of the
time, depending on what...

32:55.480 --> 32:58.920
He loves to be around people.
That's all he knows.
He can't be out in the wild.

32:58.960 --> 33:01.960
OK, I get that... but you had
him as your best man?

33:02.000 --> 33:04.960
-(LAUGHTER)
-He was best man at one of...
Yeah, he was.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.600
We actually have a photograph of
the wedding here.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.480
(LAUGHTER)

33:10.520 --> 33:13.440
That's the sloppiest kiss
I had that night.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.200
And then he came
for Thanksgiving dinners?

33:15.240 --> 33:16.880
I think
we've got a picture of that.

33:16.920 --> 33:18.600
There - look.

33:18.640 --> 33:22.120
-That is a big bear.
-That's huge.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.200
-Does he like turkey?
-He loves turkey.

33:24.240 --> 33:27.680
Ate the whole thing.
Mashed potatoes. Everything.

33:27.720 --> 33:30.120
Can I just ask...? You have a
sanctuary, a bear sanctuary.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.840
-Correct.
-And how's the dynamic,

33:31.880 --> 33:34.640
like, compared to his dynamic
with you and the other bears?

33:34.680 --> 33:37.320
Does he go, "Hey, I get on with
humans and you don't"?

33:37.360 --> 33:40.000
A little bit. I mean,
he's the one
that gets to come home

33:40.040 --> 33:42.600
and do things that the other
bears can't really do.

33:42.640 --> 33:44.400
But it's like a soap opera.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.400
He has different relationships
with different bears.

33:46.440 --> 33:49.080
He's got a girlfriend named
Bella who's younger than him,

33:49.120 --> 33:52.040
-and they wrestle around
all the time.
-(LAUGHTER)

33:52.080 --> 33:55.320
So, that's your bear, OK? Now,
yours
is rather different.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.920
Yes, thankfully! (LAUGHS)

33:57.960 --> 34:00.640
Although yours
is probably more mischievous.
Paddington is.

34:00.680 --> 34:04.520
Yes, he gets stuck
in the fridge, in the film...

34:04.560 --> 34:07.440
-Impossible.
-Have you come across Paddington
Bear in America?

34:07.480 --> 34:10.320
-Yeah, definitely.
-Because it very much
has been a British

34:10.360 --> 34:12.600
character for decades, really.

34:12.640 --> 34:16.400
But he gets up to all sorts of
mischief, and his favourite
thing is marmalade.

34:16.440 --> 34:20.120
And so, apart from getting stuck
in the fridge...

34:20.160 --> 34:22.480
This time round,
in the second film,

34:22.520 --> 34:25.480
he tries to become a barber, he
tries to be a window cleaner.

34:25.520 --> 34:27.720
None of these things go
particularly well.

34:27.760 --> 34:30.520
We do have a clip.
I'd like to show that for you
now, if I may.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.520
I'm sorry. This is
a private conversation.

34:32.560 --> 34:34.840
Oh, it's all right, Mr Brown.
This is my friend, Knuckles.

34:34.880 --> 34:36.240
-How are you?
-And this is Phibs.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.360
-G'day.
-Spoon.

34:37.400 --> 34:38.720
-Hello.
-Jimmy the Snitch.

34:38.760 --> 34:41.600
T-Bone. The Professor. Squeaky
Pete.

34:41.640 --> 34:45.760
Double Bass Bob. Farmer Jack.
Mad Dog. Johnny Cashpoint.

34:45.800 --> 34:48.000
-Sir Geoffrey Wilcott.
-I hope
I can rely on your vote.

34:48.040 --> 34:50.760
-And Charley Rumble.
-(GROWLS)

34:50.800 --> 34:52.880
Oh, it's so wonderful
to meet you all.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.640
It's a great relief to know

34:55.680 --> 34:58.760
that Paddington's already made
such sweet friends.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.360
Would you excuse us a moment?

35:02.520 --> 35:05.360
-What are you doing?
-Talking to the nice men.

35:05.400 --> 35:08.640
Nice men? Mary,
we can't trust these people.

35:08.680 --> 35:10.320
I mean, look at them.

35:10.360 --> 35:12.960
Talk about a rogues' gallery!
Hideous.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.800
And as for that bearded baboon
in the middle,

35:14.840 --> 35:17.040
he's hardly got two brain cells
to rub together.

35:17.080 --> 35:18.680
We can still hear you,
Mr Brown.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.440
(MURMURS OF AGREEMENT)

35:21.480 --> 35:23.720
That was the light
you turned off.

35:23.760 --> 35:25.840
(LAUGHTER)

35:25.880 --> 35:28.200
JEREMY: It does look good.

35:29.960 --> 35:33.720
I should just set up, or sort of
back-set-up that clip,

35:33.760 --> 35:36.360
which is that Paddington
gets put into prison

35:36.400 --> 35:38.120
for a crime
we don't think he committed.

35:38.160 --> 35:39.640
-I'm sure
he didn't commit it.
-No.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.680
Somebody was pointing out
to me the other day -

35:41.720 --> 35:44.880
if Paddington really did arrive,
and I won't get bogged down in
immigration,

35:44.920 --> 35:49.080
but he would be in contravention
of Section 24 of the Immigration
Act.

35:49.120 --> 35:51.520
Cos he's
deliberately avoided
the immigration authorities.

35:51.560 --> 35:54.440
-And you, as Mr Brown...
-Yeah?

35:54.480 --> 35:57.840
You would potentially face
prosecution under Section 25,

35:57.880 --> 36:00.880
for assisting
unlawful immigration
to a member state.

36:00.920 --> 36:03.040
14 years in prison,
that would get you.

36:03.080 --> 36:05.120
Right. Well, there's the plot of
Paddington 3 for you!

36:05.160 --> 36:07.160
(LAUGHTER)

36:07.200 --> 36:11.720
Anyway, we must get
on to cars, cos this is...
largely a car show.

36:11.760 --> 36:14.400
Now, Casey,
the thing about Montana is,

36:14.440 --> 36:17.680
you could pretty much do
anything you liked on the road
there, until recently.

36:17.720 --> 36:20.480
Yeah, not long ago,
you could drive 100 miles
an hour down the road,

36:20.520 --> 36:22.720
drinking a beer, and have
a loaded shotgun in your lap,

36:22.760 --> 36:24.400
and you weren't
breaking the law.

36:24.440 --> 36:26.000
(LAUGHTER)

36:26.040 --> 36:28.200
-What went wrong?
-Yeah, I know!

36:28.240 --> 36:31.040
Now you can only drive 85.

36:31.080 --> 36:32.560
Cos the rule is, basically:
don't crash.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.360
"Just keep it between
the fences", I think...

36:34.400 --> 36:36.680
Yeah, between the fences,
between the ditches.

36:36.720 --> 36:39.560
As long as you don't go
off the road, or maybe
a little bit, you're cool.

36:39.600 --> 36:40.920
(LAUGHTER)

36:40.960 --> 36:42.280
It's largely gravel roads,
as well.

36:42.320 --> 36:44.400
Gravel roads, or icy roads.

36:44.440 --> 36:47.880
I mean, I grew up with
Land Cruisers, Willys Jeeps,
big pick-up trucks.

36:47.920 --> 36:50.840
When I haul Brutus around,
I have a big Dodge 3500.

36:50.880 --> 36:53.080
-Can he drive a car?
-(LAUGHS)

36:53.120 --> 36:55.200
No, but he likes
to tear them apart.

36:55.240 --> 36:57.760
There's been times
when we're driving
down the road to the vet,

36:57.800 --> 37:00.160
and he's like,
"What's this knob?
What's this lever?"

37:00.200 --> 37:02.600
And so the windshield wipers are
going, radio's blaring,

37:02.640 --> 37:05.840
and I'm screaming, "Get back,
Brutus! Get back, Brutus!"

37:05.880 --> 37:07.600
And he's tearing
your face off.

37:07.640 --> 37:10.040
(LAUGHS) You imagine the drivers
driving by, saying...

37:12.040 --> 37:15.920
Now, you're not particularly, I
don't think, a helmsman.

37:15.960 --> 37:19.680
No, I'm not.
I'm not a petrol-head
of any, you know, type.

37:19.720 --> 37:22.840
Cars, for me, get me
from A to B, I'm afraid.

37:22.880 --> 37:27.480
In recent months
I had my proper,
full-blown midlife crisis

37:27.520 --> 37:28.880
and decided
to buy a convertible.

37:28.920 --> 37:30.760
My wife said,
"Don't be ridiculous.

37:30.800 --> 37:33.840
It is only sunny in England
about two days a year."

37:33.880 --> 37:35.680
Exactly, yeah.
"Don't be so stupid."

37:35.720 --> 37:38.120
So, I went
and bought a convertible,
and then I thought,

37:38.160 --> 37:40.800
"Actually, what I really want is
an electric car."

37:40.840 --> 37:44.040
-So, I said to my wife
at the end of the summer...
-(LAUGHTER)

37:44.080 --> 37:46.600
"I'm getting rid
of the convertible
and getting an electric car."

37:46.640 --> 37:49.920
She said, "Don't be ridiculous!
We've had a great summer in that
convertible.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.800
You're not
getting rid of it."

37:51.840 --> 37:55.600
But meanwhile,
I'd already placed an order for
a second-hand Tesla.

37:55.640 --> 37:59.080
So, I am now a Tesla owner, and
I love it, Jeremy!

37:59.120 --> 38:00.960
(LAUGHTER)

38:01.000 --> 38:02.520
-Which is yours? The S?
-Yes.

38:02.560 --> 38:05.040
And my friend down the road has
the top-of-the-range,

38:05.080 --> 38:08.640
and we actually have
a Tesla coffee group.

38:08.680 --> 38:11.520
-Oh, Christ.
-(LAUGHTER)

38:11.560 --> 38:13.480
-There are three--
-How evangelical!

38:13.520 --> 38:15.760
There are three...
four of us, actually, now.

38:15.800 --> 38:18.680
Another mate's just got one. So,
in about a five-mile radius,

38:18.720 --> 38:21.680
and we literally go and stare at
each other's cars.

38:21.720 --> 38:24.120
I've never had an interest
in cars at all,

38:24.160 --> 38:25.720
and I love my Tesla.

38:25.760 --> 38:28.760
(LAUGHTER)

38:28.800 --> 38:31.960
I can't imagine
the electric car has
caught on much in Montana.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.520
-I'm part
of a Tesla coffee group, too.
-Oh, Christ.

38:34.560 --> 38:37.960
How have we ended up
with this?

38:38.000 --> 38:41.520
Right. Now, obviously,
you came here to do
your laps. How did it go?

38:41.560 --> 38:44.520
Ah, look, I'm not a driver, and
I would say

38:44.560 --> 38:48.840
that I'm probably about
a minute slower than him. That's
my prediction.

38:48.880 --> 38:50.720
A minute would be something
quite spectacular!

38:50.760 --> 38:53.200
(LAUGHS)
I'm like an old granny.

38:53.240 --> 38:54.920
Well, that's
cos you're from Downton.

38:54.960 --> 38:57.640
The car had barely been
invented - that's what it is.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.480
The gravel must have been second
nature for you.

38:59.520 --> 39:02.080
Oh, when I heard that there was
gravel, and I saw it,

39:02.120 --> 39:04.320
I'm like, "Oh,
I might have a chance here."

39:04.360 --> 39:06.480
-That was my edge.
-Damn!

39:06.520 --> 39:09.640
Well, now, whose lap
shall we see first? Hmmm...

39:09.680 --> 39:11.160
We'll go with you
first of all.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.160
Who'd like
to see Hugh's lap?

39:13.200 --> 39:15.240
-(CHEERING)
-Let's have a look.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.560
(ENGINE ROARING)

39:18.600 --> 39:20.960
There it is. Two-litre engine
crackling away.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.640
What do you mean,
you need the toilet?

39:23.680 --> 39:27.120
You've taken Paddington with
you in the car. And is that
a crash helmet he's got on?

39:27.160 --> 39:30.160
HUGH: Oh, yes.
-Brilliant.

39:30.200 --> 39:33.320
You're frightened to death.
Actually, that's not too bad.
And onto the difficult bit.

39:33.360 --> 39:35.280
-Oh, here we go.
-Yeah, there we are.

39:35.320 --> 39:37.480
Are we going
to get some sideways action?

39:38.680 --> 39:40.120
Oh, yes, we are.

39:41.320 --> 39:43.160
Nearly stopped.

39:45.320 --> 39:47.800
Virtually in reverse.

39:47.840 --> 39:51.480
I think what they're doing
is playing the film in slow
motion. Let's be kind.

39:51.520 --> 39:53.280
They did say
you were very slow,

39:53.320 --> 39:56.320
but no, that's not very slow.

39:56.360 --> 40:00.000
Hang on. Let's have
a look through here.
Tail out again. That's good.

40:00.040 --> 40:02.680
Coming back onto...
Oh, no, you've got
a bit of a tank-slapper!

40:02.720 --> 40:06.120
And back on the Tarmac,
where it's very slippery,
but you've held that nicely.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.480
Right.
Now for the tricky bit.

40:09.520 --> 40:11.680
-Oh, this bit was--
-It's OK.
You're making it look tricky.

40:11.720 --> 40:14.240
-(LAUGHS)
-And there we are,
onto the straight.

40:14.280 --> 40:18.040
âª Here we go
round the mulberry bush,
the mulberry bush, the... âª

40:18.080 --> 40:21.760
Keeping Paddington happy. Were
you flat through there?

40:21.800 --> 40:23.440
Yeah...

40:23.480 --> 40:26.320
That was leaning on it.
You are good on the Tarmac.

40:26.360 --> 40:28.920
Final corner,
and tail out again.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.840
Nicely done, Hugh,
and across the line!
There we are, everybody.

40:31.880 --> 40:33.600
-Well, done.
-Pretty good.

40:33.640 --> 40:35.080
JEREMY: That's not bad!

40:35.120 --> 40:41.520
Honestly...a couple
of slow bits, but not bad.

40:41.560 --> 40:45.640
Who'd like to see Casey's lap?
Done without a bear
in his car. Here we go.

40:48.160 --> 40:50.800
Vigorous,
little two-litre engine.

40:50.840 --> 40:53.160
OK, this thing
has got some power.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.320
JEREMY: Yeah,
but it is only two-litre.

40:55.360 --> 40:58.640
I'm amazed
that was big enough for you,
with your big pick-ups.

40:58.680 --> 41:01.120
Nicely,
tidily done through there.

41:01.160 --> 41:03.760
Very tidy indeed.
Keeping it smooth.

41:03.800 --> 41:07.760
And onto the gravel. Now, this
is where he's at home.

41:07.800 --> 41:10.840
Except for the beer
and the shotgun.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.680
(CASEY LAUGHS)

41:12.720 --> 41:14.760
Oh, nicely held
through there, flicking it back
the other way.

41:14.800 --> 41:16.200
Sideways on that one.

41:16.240 --> 41:19.280
Big smile. It is funny
how a fully grown man

41:19.320 --> 41:22.920
can be made to smile
by sliding a car on gravel.

41:22.960 --> 41:25.440
That does look good
in the afternoon sun there,

41:25.480 --> 41:29.240
as the F-Type comes up now,
back towards the Tarmac.

41:29.280 --> 41:31.400
No tank-slapper going on there.
This is always tricky.

41:31.440 --> 41:34.720
(TYRES SQUEALING)

41:34.760 --> 41:37.720
You are the master
of understeer.

41:37.760 --> 41:39.480
Yep, that looks good.
Bit of dust.

41:39.520 --> 41:41.600
Nearly stopped,
but we're going again.

41:41.640 --> 41:44.800
It's my nemesis
coming up right here.

41:44.840 --> 41:46.680
Yeah. Understeer again?

41:46.720 --> 41:49.920
No, that was really...
Oh, what are you doing?

41:49.960 --> 41:52.920
That's a Scandi Flick,
or something
near a Scandi Flick.

41:52.960 --> 41:56.080
And more understeer,
and there we are,
ladies and gentlemen.

41:56.120 --> 41:58.800
-Across the line, as well!
-(APPLAUSE)

41:58.840 --> 42:01.440
CASEY: A little crazy.
-(LAUGHTER)

42:04.360 --> 42:07.320
So far, the Brits have won every
single week.

42:07.360 --> 42:10.240
-OK.
-We're hoping
to keep that up.

42:10.280 --> 42:12.520
I've got the times here.

42:13.720 --> 42:16.000
Hugh Bonneville,
you did it...

42:16.040 --> 42:18.160
And just to give you
some idea...

42:18.200 --> 42:20.320
The fastest so far is a 1:17.

42:20.360 --> 42:23.560
The slowest
is David Hasselhoff. 1:24.

42:24.720 --> 42:27.760
You did it in one

42:27.800 --> 42:30.560
22

42:30.600 --> 42:32.520
.2.

42:32.560 --> 42:34.760
-So, you're faster
than David Hasselhoff.
-Beat the Hoff!

42:34.800 --> 42:37.200
-Beat the Hoff.
-Beat the Hoff.

42:39.160 --> 42:40.680
Well done.

42:40.720 --> 42:41.800
But...

42:44.040 --> 42:47.240
Did you beat
our American guest,
who's come very far for this?

42:47.280 --> 42:49.520
Casey Anderson.

42:49.560 --> 42:53.560
1:18.6.

42:53.600 --> 42:56.000
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

42:56.040 --> 42:57.680
Congratulations.

42:57.720 --> 42:59.760
So, there we are -
our first American winner.

43:01.120 --> 43:04.280
First one. Sorry, Hugh.

43:04.320 --> 43:05.640
There we are,
ladies and gentlemen.

43:05.680 --> 43:08.480
A very big thanks
to Hugh Bonneville

43:08.520 --> 43:11.520
and the fastest man who lives
with a bear, Casey Anderson!

43:11.560 --> 43:13.360
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

43:19.000 --> 43:20.920
Now, in olden times,

43:20.960 --> 43:23.600
the furthest you could
ever travel in one day

43:23.640 --> 43:26.880
was as far as your horse could
go before it died.

43:26.920 --> 43:30.960
Yeah, and then, in the late
'50s, the invention of jets and
helicopters meant,

43:31.000 --> 43:35.040
if you had the money, you could
have breakfast in the South of
France on a boat,

43:35.080 --> 43:36.800
go skiing in the Alps
at lunch time,

43:36.840 --> 43:40.440
and get to Turin in time
for dinner with a Contessa.

43:40.480 --> 43:42.640
Yeah. Now,
this created the jet-set,

43:42.680 --> 43:46.640
which is all very "Where do you
go to, my lovely, when you're
alone in your bed?"

43:46.680 --> 43:50.320
But I was wondering,
now that cars are so fast

43:50.360 --> 43:53.200
and roads, by and large,
are good - we have motorways,
for example -

43:53.240 --> 43:55.960
do you need the jets
and helicopters any more?

43:56.000 --> 43:57.680
Yeah, you do.

43:57.720 --> 44:01.160
Well, to find out, I took the
Grand Tour to Saint-Tropez.

44:07.560 --> 44:09.400
(EASY-LISTENING MUSIC)

44:24.680 --> 44:27.080

44:30.320 --> 44:33.080
Ah, morning.

44:33.120 --> 44:36.640
I've got dinner tonight
in Turin with the Contessa,

44:36.680 --> 44:38.680
but I fancy a bit of skiing.

44:38.720 --> 44:41.080
So, could you
bring the car round?

44:41.120 --> 44:45.480
And can you make sure there are
no ordinary people near it? I
don't want a disease.

44:46.680 --> 44:47.920
Good.

45:01.800 --> 45:03.520
(ENGINE ROARING)

45:06.400 --> 45:09.480
Soon, Giovanni arrived
at the boat with my car.

45:11.560 --> 45:13.960
And after
he'd loaded the boot

45:14.000 --> 45:16.880
with half
of what I'd need for the day,

45:16.920 --> 45:19.440
I climbed aboard and set off.

45:27.320 --> 45:30.120
Right. What all these people are
looking at

45:30.160 --> 45:36.840
is Bugatti's answer to the
Agusta 109 and Gulfstream G6.

45:36.880 --> 45:40.040
It's called the Chiron,
and there's no other way
of saying this.

45:40.080 --> 45:41.880
It's the fastest car
in the world.

45:46.720 --> 45:51.680
Obviously,
it isn't the fastest car
in the world right now,

45:51.720 --> 45:55.600
because I'm sort of going round
the port
in Saint-Tropez,

45:55.640 --> 45:59.720
but this, in fact,
is the Bugatti's party piece.

46:05.880 --> 46:08.040
But think about it.

46:08.080 --> 46:11.960
This is a 1,479-horsepower,

46:12.000 --> 46:16.960
261-mile-an-hour rocket ship.

46:17.000 --> 46:21.280
It is engineering taken
to the max, and then some.

46:21.320 --> 46:26.520
And yet I'm doing
20 miles an hour
and it feels like a Golf.

46:28.080 --> 46:29.360
It's like Concorde.

46:29.400 --> 46:31.520
Anyone in the sky
in the 1960s

46:31.560 --> 46:35.320
who was doing twice
the speed of sound
was wearing a G-suit.

46:35.360 --> 46:38.240
But on Concorde
they were doing
twice the speed of sound

46:38.280 --> 46:40.000
while wearing a lounge suit,

46:40.040 --> 46:44.800
sipping from a glass
of ChÃ¢teau Margaux.

46:44.840 --> 46:47.080
That was the brilliance
of Concorde.

46:47.120 --> 46:53.480
It was right at the edge
of what was technically
possible, but it felt normal.

46:53.520 --> 46:55.120
That's what the Bugatti's doing
here.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.720
Eventually, though, I emerged

46:59.760 --> 47:02.600
from the summer-long
Saint-Tropez traffic jam

47:02.640 --> 47:04.520
and joined the motorway,

47:04.560 --> 47:07.880
home turf for the Chiron and
the monster that powers it.

47:09.240 --> 47:11.160
It's an eight-litre monster,

47:11.200 --> 47:12.840
with 16 cylinders

47:12.880 --> 47:18.880
and enough grunt to make
kilometres feel like inches.

47:18.920 --> 47:21.960
(ENGINE ROARING)

47:34.600 --> 47:37.520
We all thought the Veyron
was fairly amazing,

47:37.560 --> 47:41.400
but this has...
out-amazinged it.

47:41.440 --> 47:44.760
Let me give you a few
of the headline statistics.

47:47.120 --> 47:52.040
The Chiron accelerates
from 0 to 186 miles an hour

47:52.080 --> 47:56.200
faster than a Toyota hatchback
accelerates
from 0 to 60.

47:58.080 --> 48:01.960
Flat out, this will
drain its fuel tank...

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
Ready? ...in nine minutes.

48:06.040 --> 48:08.720
And to put that in a language
the youth can understand,

48:08.760 --> 48:13.960
it's like drinking
seven shot glasses
full of petrol every second.

48:16.160 --> 48:19.400
The Chiron has ten radiators.

48:19.440 --> 48:21.600
That's more than I've got
in my apartment.

48:21.640 --> 48:23.360
And then
there's the water pump,

48:23.400 --> 48:27.880
which sends 200 gallons
of water a minute
round the engine.

48:27.920 --> 48:30.600
That could brim a bath
in 12 seconds.

48:32.160 --> 48:35.160
Firemen use less powerful pumps
than that.

48:36.920 --> 48:38.400
It's not a cheap car to buy.

48:38.440 --> 48:42.400
In fact,
it costs Â£2.5 million.

48:42.440 --> 48:44.600
And it's not cheap to run,
either.

48:44.640 --> 48:48.680
The tyres, for instance,
cost Â£13,000.

48:50.480 --> 48:53.600
The stats just go on
and on and on,

48:53.640 --> 48:55.400
but all
you can ever think is,

48:55.440 --> 48:57.280
"Bloody hell,
this thing's quick!"

49:05.400 --> 49:06.920
(ENGINE ROARING)

49:06.960 --> 49:10.360
Obviously, I can't show you how
fast on a motorway,

49:10.400 --> 49:12.280
because the French police

49:12.320 --> 49:15.480
have completely lost
their sense of humour
about speeding.

49:16.640 --> 49:18.720
So I had to make a call.

a deserted air field and...

49:28.320 --> 49:33.680
What shall I get? ...a BMW M4

49:33.720 --> 49:36.200
-Certainly, sir.
-Thanks.

OK. I don't really have time to
do this on my busy day,

but what I'm going to do
is demonstrate to you

49:49.600 --> 49:53.480
the difference
between a really fast car

49:53.520 --> 49:55.320

50:34.480 --> 50:37.360
There is no doubt in my mind

50:37.400 --> 50:40.480
that this is faster
than flying. It just is.

50:40.520 --> 50:45.080
I mean, if I were
to be racing Hammond today
in his silly helicopter,

50:45.120 --> 50:48.400
he'd still be sitting
at the heliport in Saint-Tropez,
saying,

50:48.440 --> 50:54.640
"Requesting ILS Vector, Golf

"Oh, aren't you clever, being
able to fly a helicopter?"

51:01.560 --> 51:04.520
Not really.

51:04.560 --> 51:08.600
I, on the other hand,
having got no clearance
at all from anyone,

51:08.640 --> 51:12.440
had turned off the motorway and
into the foothills
of the Alps.

51:22.440 --> 51:25.200
And you might imagine that, on
roads like this,

51:25.240 --> 51:29.120
a mid-engine supercar
would be divine.

51:29.160 --> 51:32.840
But this is no ordinary
mid-engine supercar.

51:34.800 --> 51:40.240
A McLaren 720, or a Ford GT,
they would be brilliant here.

51:40.280 --> 51:45.400
But this...
I'm gonna be honest with you.
It feels heavy.

51:45.440 --> 51:49.000
Because it is. I'm not saying
it's cumbersome.

51:49.040 --> 51:50.840
I'm not saying getting
it up this mountain road

51:50.880 --> 51:53.680
is like getting a cow
up a step-ladder.

51:53.720 --> 51:58.000
But it's not delicate
or deft or dainty.

No, the Chiron,
it tackles mountain roads

52:04.120 --> 52:06.920
in a way I've never experienced
before.

then you're in the next one.

52:29.160 --> 52:30.240
Pretty much immediately.

flow up a hill like this,

52:45.240 --> 52:47.880
but this is more staccato.

52:50.160 --> 52:54.160
Weirdly, then,
the best way to enjoy
this car on a mountain road

52:54.200 --> 52:58.880
is to drive it
much more slowly
than it can actually go.

53:10.960 --> 53:13.080
Is this a bad thing?

53:13.120 --> 53:15.680
Well, not when you remember who
it's been made for.

53:20.800 --> 53:23.400
If you tell
the Bugatti customer

53:23.440 --> 53:27.440
that this can generate 2G
in the corners,
he won't care less.

53:27.480 --> 53:31.800
Tell him it's got 3K diamonds in
the speakers,
and he'll say, "Really?"

53:31.840 --> 53:33.760
Only, in a Russian accent.

53:37.120 --> 53:39.640
I think they've judged this to
perfection.

53:44.400 --> 53:46.960
Soon I arrived
at Les Deux Alpes,

53:47.000 --> 53:50.920
where I removed my ski boot
from the boot,

53:50.960 --> 53:52.800
bought another
from the shop...

53:52.840 --> 53:55.520
Merci. Oui, Ã  plus tard.

53:55.560 --> 53:57.920

to find a glacier.

54:33.360 --> 54:37.720
It is remarkable that,
in this day and age,

54:37.760 --> 54:39.720
I've been able to do this.

54:39.760 --> 54:43.560
Just a few hours ago,
I was in the South of France,

54:43.600 --> 54:46.960
surrounded by people
in their carefully designed,

54:47.000 --> 54:49.280
topless swimsuits.

54:49.320 --> 54:52.600
And now I'm on an Alp,
doing skiing,

54:52.640 --> 54:54.880
with the others
of the jet-set.

54:57.800 --> 54:59.880
It took rather longer
to get down the glacier

54:59.920 --> 55:01.400
than I'd expected.

55:01.440 --> 55:03.960
So,
when I got back to the town,

55:04.000 --> 55:07.560
I had to get my skis off
and my skates on.

55:10.960 --> 55:14.120
Not that you could actually
hear that I had my skates on.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.800

you get in a Chiron

your fingernails out

where, so far as I can tell,

56:11.160 --> 56:15.360
speeding isn't really seen
as a crime at all.

56:15.400 --> 56:17.400

56:17.440 --> 56:19.600
