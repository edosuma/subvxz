00:14.006 --> 00:16.124
(Quiet suspenseful music)

00:28.596 --> 00:30.595
(Charlie)
Listen to me, Elliot.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.552
Listen now.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.749
Don't let this destroy you.

00:43.666 --> 00:47.144
If you feel you're slipping,
talk to me.

00:50.462 --> 00:52.461
Promise.

01:27.478 --> 01:29.477
(Distant siren blares)

01:30.916 --> 01:33.354
(Gentle dramatic music)

01:47.145 --> 01:49.144
It's not over yet.

01:50.903 --> 01:53.201
We sent a message,

01:53.301 --> 01:56.419
but now is the time
we're the most vulnerable.

02:17.566 --> 02:20.004
(Phone vibrates)

03:11.811 --> 03:14.669
Do you know
how much we have lost?

03:14.769 --> 03:20.065
Product, men, weapons?

03:20.165 --> 03:22.324
They can be replaced.

03:24.522 --> 03:27.840
With whose money, Koba? Yours?

03:29.639 --> 03:32.977
Sean Wallace
and those fucking Kurds

03:33.077 --> 03:36.155
have blown holes
in our entire operations.

03:37.314 --> 03:40.672
We don't know even yet
where are all the wounds,

03:42.271 --> 03:44.509
never mind
how to stop the bleeding.

03:46.628 --> 03:49.226
And the power, respect,

03:50.386 --> 03:52.384
how much of all that

03:53.584 --> 03:56.002
has Sean Wallace
wrenched from us?

03:56.102 --> 03:58.640
Don't worry about Sean Wallace.

03:58.740 --> 04:02.938
I shouldn't have to.
That's your job.

04:06.016 --> 04:09.693
You need to direct your anger
away from me.

04:11.412 --> 04:13.890
This happened on your watch.

04:14.730 --> 04:16.229
I'm supposed to know some kid

04:16.329 --> 04:19.946
the Investors thought they killed
is planning to attack us.

04:20.046 --> 04:23.964
Hm. How do I see this?
I'm clairvoyant?!

04:25.003 --> 04:27.082
You don't have to be clairvoyant.

04:28.161 --> 04:30.160
You just need to do your job.

04:33.278 --> 04:36.876
You lost focus, Koba,
and you were hit.

04:38.914 --> 04:40.973
And you know the worst part?

04:41.073 --> 04:43.072
You don't even know
what hit you.

04:44.151 --> 04:46.829
You forget
who you are speaking to.

04:49.348 --> 04:53.345
You forget
who you are working for.

04:56.343 --> 04:58.582
I heard from the Investors.

04:59.781 --> 05:03.778
Kill Sean Wallace,
or they'll kill you.

06:01.781 --> 06:03.879
You did well last night.

06:03.979 --> 06:07.517
The gangs are hurt.
Koba's hurt.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.495
Which means
the Investors are hurt too.

06:11.974 --> 06:14.073
So what now?

06:14.173 --> 06:17.311
You make the Investors
quietly disappear?

06:17.411 --> 06:21.748
No. The higher-ups
want this win on the books.

06:21.848 --> 06:23.666
It goes through the system.

06:23.766 --> 06:27.044
And you think Elliot
will uphold his side of the deal?

06:28.523 --> 06:33.120
They're getting out today.
New country, new life.

06:34.040 --> 06:36.418
Fine. Then this is goodbye.

06:36.518 --> 06:38.517
(Door handle clunks)

06:43.794 --> 06:49.070
Relax. There's no sniper
in the window.

06:50.669 --> 06:52.908
But this isn't goodbye.

06:54.067 --> 06:57.065
We want the Wallaces
back on top.

06:59.104 --> 07:01.922
But you don't get free rein.

07:02.022 --> 07:05.899
Okay, so who's holding
the reins? You?

07:08.538 --> 07:10.536
We all answer to someone.

07:12.935 --> 07:15.093
(Dramatic music)

07:18.731 --> 07:20.730
(Lock clunks)

07:52.309 --> 07:54.328
- (Charlie) Elliot.
- You ready?

07:54.428 --> 07:56.766
Oh, Dad, you're not even packed yet.
Come on!

07:56.866 --> 07:58.645
You called half an hour ago.

07:58.745 --> 08:02.323
I don't move as fast
as I used to, do I?

08:02.423 --> 08:06.820
You're moving in a blur, son.
Flight's not till 12:30.

08:14.375 --> 08:16.034
Look, you just finish this.

08:16.134 --> 08:19.012
I'm going to the bathroom.
Be done before I get back out.

08:41.757 --> 08:44.415
(Toilet flushes)

08:44.515 --> 08:46.594
(Dramatic music)

09:09.499 --> 09:12.337
(Pop music playing)

09:14.016 --> 09:16.935
(Indistinct chatter)

09:29.726 --> 09:31.725
Is this us now, Luan?

09:36.642 --> 09:38.620
Broken. Hiding...

09:38.720 --> 09:40.879
Be patient. It's not forever.

09:41.559 --> 09:42.978
We just need time -

09:43.078 --> 09:45.856
for you to get better
and to figure out the next move.

09:45.956 --> 09:48.474
(Video game bleeps)

09:50.593 --> 09:52.591
(Doorbell rings)

09:59.787 --> 10:02.145
- Can I help you with something?
- Where's Luan?

10:04.104 --> 10:06.882
I, uh... I never heard of him.

10:06.982 --> 10:10.540
You've heard of him and you've heard
of me. Now where the fuck is he?

10:23.691 --> 10:27.049
- Put it down, Luan.
- Put yours down first.

10:30.647 --> 10:32.506
Don't do this.

10:32.606 --> 10:35.164
Luan, we're here
out of friendship.

10:54.711 --> 10:57.629
(Coughing)

11:06.783 --> 11:08.882
The city's at war.

11:08.982 --> 11:11.600
Last night wasn't
an act of aggression.

11:11.700 --> 11:15.078
It was strategic.
Our enemies now fear us

11:15.178 --> 11:17.556
and our friends now know
there's another option.

11:17.656 --> 11:20.475
You don't have any friends.

11:20.575 --> 11:23.613
You don't want Koba running this city
just as much as me.

11:25.851 --> 11:29.948
Join me.
Together we'll finish him.

11:30.048 --> 11:32.127
You don't know who this man is,
do you?

11:34.246 --> 11:37.364
No one has the balls
to go against Koba.

11:39.962 --> 11:45.199
Ed Dumani did, but God knows
if he's alive or not.

11:47.117 --> 11:52.074
You underestimate me.
And yourself.

11:54.872 --> 11:57.591
- Together...
- Together what?

12:08.863 --> 12:12.101
Don't fuck with him.
You cannot beat him.

12:13.061 --> 12:16.398
He'll keep coming back
and coming back

12:16.498 --> 12:20.116
until you and your brother

12:20.216 --> 12:24.413
and your mother are all dead.

12:25.093 --> 12:27.092
(Discordant music)

12:30.849 --> 12:32.848
That's who he is.

12:36.645 --> 12:38.644
We're done here.

12:43.441 --> 12:44.740
(Clears throat)

12:44.840 --> 12:46.839
Let's go.

12:56.393 --> 12:58.991
- (Video game gunfire)
- Alexa, volume down.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.448
- Marian.
- Shannon.

13:03.548 --> 13:05.567
Something's happened
to your father.

13:05.667 --> 13:07.365
You and Danny
need to get out now.

13:07.465 --> 13:09.464
Go somewhere safe.

13:12.422 --> 13:14.521
Danny, switch that thing off
and get dressed now.

13:14.621 --> 13:15.640
Mum.

13:15.740 --> 13:17.739
Now.

13:39.125 --> 13:42.323
(Door clunks opens)

14:30.892 --> 14:35.768
I thought soup would be best.
No need to chew, huh?

14:40.285 --> 14:42.284
It's lentil spinach.

14:47.681 --> 14:50.999
It's not spicy.
It won't hurt your gums.

14:55.476 --> 14:58.634
Come on, Ed. Huh?

15:12.665 --> 15:14.663
I won't lie to you, Ed.

15:18.621 --> 15:20.619
You will die in this room.

15:23.897 --> 15:26.895
But not yet.

15:29.414 --> 15:31.512
You're a font of knowledge.

15:31.612 --> 15:36.029
So, I'm going
to ask you questions

15:36.129 --> 15:39.147
and you're going to answer,
keeping in mind,

15:39.247 --> 15:42.965
the moment I feel you no longer
provide valuable information,

15:44.324 --> 15:46.323
it's over.

15:49.601 --> 15:51.599
And it won't be fast.

15:53.238 --> 15:55.757
And I won't stop
at the one Dumani.

16:01.793 --> 16:04.031
(Dramatic music)

16:12.306 --> 16:14.005
(Bones crack)

16:14.105 --> 16:16.103
(Sighs)

16:17.223 --> 16:19.921
Tell me about Sean Wallace.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.080
What are his strengths,
his weaknesses?

16:22.180 --> 16:24.878
What does he love?
What does he hate?

16:24.978 --> 16:27.536
What does he want to be?

16:29.615 --> 16:31.613
(Sighs)

16:37.650 --> 16:39.648
His father.

16:42.327 --> 16:44.325
To which question?

16:47.363 --> 16:49.362
All of them.

17:00.715 --> 17:03.033
(Quiet dramatic music)

17:20.822 --> 17:23.020
(Phone vibrates)

17:26.258 --> 17:28.257
Hello?

17:31.175 --> 17:33.174
Yeah, listen, I'll call you back.

17:35.852 --> 17:39.350
Elliot, if Koba had my dad,
where would he be?

17:39.450 --> 17:43.447
Shannon, listen, if your dad's
made an enemy of Koba...

17:45.046 --> 17:47.045
he's not holding him anywhere.

17:48.484 --> 17:49.903
Sorry, Shannon.

17:50.003 --> 17:52.161
He's not dead, Elliot.

17:53.241 --> 17:55.239
He can't be.

17:56.359 --> 17:58.357
I can't lose them both.

18:00.276 --> 18:05.633
If he had my dad...
where would he be?

18:09.750 --> 18:11.749
(Music builds)

18:53.562 --> 18:55.600
(Charlie)
Driving, then?

18:59.198 --> 19:00.417
(Paper rustles)

19:00.517 --> 19:02.816
(Music quietens)

19:02.916 --> 19:05.254
(Charlie)
What's this?

19:05.354 --> 19:10.351
That... That's your new passport
and driving licence.

19:11.750 --> 19:15.148
We need to get rid of your old one
before we get to the airport.

19:20.504 --> 19:22.503
Ezra Fox?

19:23.742 --> 19:26.980
And I'm your son, Miles.
Actually, you should say it.

19:27.939 --> 19:31.097
"I'm Ezra Fox
and this is my son, Miles."

19:33.136 --> 19:35.135
Go on.

19:37.054 --> 19:39.052
Come on.

19:40.172 --> 19:42.170
Say it.

19:48.126 --> 19:50.125
What have you done, Elliot?

19:54.043 --> 19:56.041
What have you done?

19:57.320 --> 20:00.558
You want me to give up
my name, my home.

20:01.718 --> 20:03.716
You've gotta level with me.

20:06.714 --> 20:08.713
Now.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.710
I kill people, Dad.

20:20.585 --> 20:23.124
They make me do it.

20:23.224 --> 20:26.182
I have to. Or they'll kill you.

20:27.221 --> 20:29.220
They'll kill both of us.

20:36.375 --> 20:38.814
No... No.

20:41.452 --> 20:43.451
You promised.

20:44.650 --> 20:46.649
I know.

20:52.845 --> 20:56.602
What am I supposed to do?

21:08.394 --> 21:10.393
(Charlie)
Jesus Christ.

21:20.147 --> 21:24.124
Let's get on that plane,
put this fucking place behind us

21:24.224 --> 21:25.763
and land as new men.

21:25.863 --> 21:29.381
I'm Ezra Fox
and you're my son, Miles.

21:31.819 --> 21:33.818
Right?

21:37.296 --> 21:39.694
(Music builds)

21:45.930 --> 21:48.548
(Elliot) Listen, Dad,
there's something I need to do

21:48.648 --> 21:50.387
before we get on the plane.

21:50.487 --> 21:53.425
There's a man called Joseph Singer
who will approach you.

21:53.525 --> 21:55.664
Don't worry,
he knows who you are.

21:55.764 --> 22:00.701
If I don't make it back in time...
give this to him

22:00.801 --> 22:02.959
and he will make sure
that you're on that flight.

22:03.559 --> 22:05.797
Elliot, no.

22:07.356 --> 22:10.854
You've got to get out of here.
Let's just get on that plane.

22:10.954 --> 22:13.153
It's just this last thing, Dad.

22:16.470 --> 22:18.689
Give this to Singer

22:18.789 --> 22:21.287
and I swear to you
we're out of here.

22:21.387 --> 22:23.546
(Dramatic music)

22:27.823 --> 22:29.862
(Music fades)

22:30.501 --> 22:32.660
We lost eight men last night.

22:36.058 --> 22:38.176
Nobody's feeling it more than me.

22:41.614 --> 22:44.013
But now it's time
for everyone to step up.

22:49.289 --> 22:51.648
You understand me?

22:56.684 --> 22:59.343
Now get back out there.

22:59.443 --> 23:02.001
(Murmurs)

23:21.668 --> 23:23.667
I know you got my back.

23:25.346 --> 23:27.624
I want you to help me
lead these men.

23:34.860 --> 23:36.978
Will you stand with me?

23:49.570 --> 23:51.569
Condolences.

23:53.048 --> 23:55.047
Condolences.

23:56.646 --> 23:58.824
You.

23:58.924 --> 24:02.042
You're the girl who delivered
Sean Wallace's message?

24:07.279 --> 24:09.278
Come with me.

24:09.757 --> 24:11.756
(Doorbell buzzes)

24:14.394 --> 24:16.393
I'm here to speak
to Sean Wallace.

24:42.016 --> 24:44.135
So when does he want to meet?

24:47.853 --> 24:49.671
30 minutes.

24:49.771 --> 24:51.550
Sean, it's a trap.

24:51.650 --> 24:53.669
Koba said
you can choose the place.

24:53.769 --> 24:58.086
Somewhere neutral.
A restaurant. Public.

24:59.485 --> 25:01.484
But just the two of you.

25:01.884 --> 25:06.001
I send the address and you've both
got 30 minutes to get there.

25:07.680 --> 25:10.358
No weapons.
Hands on the table.

25:10.958 --> 25:14.875
He sees any of your friends
and it's over.

25:20.232 --> 25:22.230
War again.

25:23.190 --> 25:25.188
(Quiet dramatic music)

25:35.582 --> 25:37.860
Pass me your phone.

25:46.135 --> 25:48.134
Sean.

25:50.932 --> 25:53.610
(Types message)

26:01.565 --> 26:03.564
(Sean sniffs)

26:08.480 --> 26:10.479
You must hate me.

26:12.238 --> 26:14.597
After the things
you've seen me do.

26:21.552 --> 26:23.791
I bet you'd like to kill me,
wouldn't you?

26:29.867 --> 26:31.865
Yes, I would.

26:39.980 --> 26:41.979
You can go.

26:50.094 --> 26:52.332
(Dramatic music)

27:12.759 --> 27:14.758
(Phone vibrates)

27:18.795 --> 27:19.774
Hello?

27:19.874 --> 27:21.693
(Miss Kane)
You shouldn't have done that, Elliott.

27:21.793 --> 27:24.591
I would advise you to return
your father within the hour.

27:25.990 --> 27:28.349
If you let us down,
we will kill him.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.267
And then we'll kill you.

27:40.061 --> 27:42.500
(Music grows louder)

28:21.914 --> 28:23.913
(Banging)

28:26.951 --> 28:28.950
Torpedo.

28:31.148 --> 28:33.507
What the fuck
are you doing here?

28:35.345 --> 28:36.765
Bosses sent me.

28:36.865 --> 28:40.942
Huh? No one told me about that.

28:41.821 --> 28:44.020
Must be above your pay grade.

28:46.458 --> 28:49.257
There's a hard drive.

28:50.256 --> 28:53.594
They wanna know
if it got burned up in the blast.

28:53.694 --> 28:55.772
You gonna help me look for it?

29:10.243 --> 29:12.242
Shh!

29:13.681 --> 29:15.459
Where's Ed Dumani?

29:15.559 --> 29:17.758
I knew
Koba shouldn't have trusted you.

29:18.877 --> 29:23.095
Do you wanna die for Koba?
He doesn't give a fuck about you.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.893
Day after Sean's attack,
he's got you doing clean-up.

29:25.993 --> 29:28.611
You're nothing to him.

29:28.711 --> 29:31.909
Now, tell me,
where is Ed Dumani?

29:33.108 --> 29:35.427
Superstar, fuck you.

29:39.304 --> 29:41.623
(Grunts)

29:42.382 --> 29:44.381
Shh.

29:50.017 --> 29:52.376
Shh, shh. Shh.

29:57.932 --> 29:59.931
(Grunts)

30:26.474 --> 30:29.752
(Indistinct chatter)

31:24.036 --> 31:26.035
(Whispering) Ed.

31:49.100 --> 31:51.099
(Grunts)

31:51.739 --> 31:54.337
(Metallic clang)

32:20.840 --> 32:23.198
(Groaning and grunting)

33:32.154 --> 33:34.352
(Muffled screams)

34:14.126 --> 34:16.365
(Groans)

34:54.061 --> 34:56.059
(Muffled cries)

35:39.191 --> 35:41.190
Ed.

35:41.550 --> 35:44.228
(Indistinct chatter)

35:59.938 --> 36:01.937
Stop! Get down!

36:12.530 --> 36:14.529
On your knees.

36:15.088 --> 36:17.527
(Dramatic music)

36:32.277 --> 36:34.436
Tie yourself.

36:49.346 --> 36:51.345
(Grunts)

36:53.503 --> 36:55.862
(Discordant music)

37:30.999 --> 37:34.077
(Fast-paced dramatic music)

37:43.711 --> 37:45.710
(Pop music playing)

37:53.025 --> 37:55.024
- (Bell rings)
- (Children's laughter)

38:05.097 --> 38:07.096
(Bell rings)

38:30.601 --> 38:32.599
(Clears throat)

38:38.675 --> 38:40.674
Interesting venue.

38:41.713 --> 38:42.893
(Chuckles)

38:42.993 --> 38:46.770
I'm... I'm tempted
to read into what it means

38:46.870 --> 38:48.869
why you choose here.

38:50.668 --> 38:52.946
And what have you come up with?

38:54.825 --> 38:59.022
Husbands, wives, kids.
Birthday parties.

39:01.621 --> 39:04.039
Regular life.

39:04.139 --> 39:06.078
Yeah.

39:06.178 --> 39:09.416
It's something
you long for, yes?

39:10.335 --> 39:13.293
What, nine to five?
Middle management?

39:14.252 --> 39:17.410
There's no shame
in seeking normality, Sean.

39:20.368 --> 39:21.787
Or I just chose this place

39:21.887 --> 39:23.906
because I figured
a Georgian assassin

39:24.006 --> 39:26.604
would stick out
like a beacon here.

39:29.523 --> 39:30.942
Ha!

39:31.042 --> 39:33.880
(Chuckles)

39:34.839 --> 39:36.838
Yeah.

39:38.077 --> 39:40.076
(Sighs)

39:40.395 --> 39:42.394
What do you want, Sean?

39:43.434 --> 39:44.972
What was mine.

39:45.072 --> 39:47.551
- What was taken from me.
- No. Um, Sean...

39:48.790 --> 39:50.789
What do you want?

39:51.588 --> 39:52.967
What can I get you?

39:53.067 --> 39:55.066
I'll get another water.
Thank you.

39:57.824 --> 40:00.662
I'll have, uh... Ooh...

40:03.341 --> 40:07.378
Mm, mm, mm,
mm, mm, mm, mm...

40:13.694 --> 40:15.693
Chicken skewers.

40:20.410 --> 40:23.807
So, really, this time,

40:25.886 --> 40:27.885
what do you want?

40:29.604 --> 40:30.983
Everything.

40:31.083 --> 40:33.481
(Background music fades)

40:35.320 --> 40:36.939
So do I.

40:37.039 --> 40:39.038
(Quiet, low-pitched drone)

40:41.996 --> 40:43.994
I'm the future.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.970
(Sighs)

40:50.070 --> 40:52.069
No, Koba.

40:53.148 --> 40:56.226
You're just a cog
in a corporate machine,

40:57.026 --> 40:58.525
beneath faceless owners

40:58.625 --> 41:01.343
who wouldn't piss down your throat
if your lungs were on fire.

41:03.422 --> 41:05.820
You're like everybody else
in this room.

41:07.299 --> 41:09.298
Middle management.

41:11.097 --> 41:13.815
You didn't even come here
with a deal, did you?

41:14.894 --> 41:16.353
(Short burst of dramatic music)

41:16.453 --> 41:19.391
You've been buying time

41:19.491 --> 41:21.770
while your men
are lining up outside.

41:24.848 --> 41:28.366
Am I just gonna get up,
go for a walk?

41:29.685 --> 41:31.224
(Imitates explosion)

41:31.324 --> 41:34.042
(Pop music in background resumes)

41:38.359 --> 41:40.718
So, what do you have
up your sleeve?

41:45.275 --> 41:47.273
A deal.

41:49.032 --> 41:50.851
Really?

41:50.951 --> 41:53.909
Okay. So, what's your offer?

42:00.505 --> 42:03.643
I know how to take down
the Investors.

42:03.743 --> 42:05.741
I know how to destroy them.

42:06.381 --> 42:08.999
You've got the gangs.

42:09.099 --> 42:13.377
Put those two together,
we'd own the entire city.

42:23.650 --> 42:25.769
(Banging on door)

42:27.208 --> 42:28.986
Jesus. Get him inside!

42:29.086 --> 42:31.265
(Groans)

42:31.365 --> 42:33.224
We need to get you to a doctor.

42:33.324 --> 42:35.902
No. I'm fine.

42:36.002 --> 42:38.620
(Shannon)
Where you going?

42:38.720 --> 42:40.719
Elliot, where you going?

42:42.118 --> 42:44.117
You coming back?

43:01.226 --> 43:03.984
Dad. Dad. Fuck!

43:08.981 --> 43:10.979
(Indistinct voice over tannoy)

43:18.015 --> 43:20.013
Charlie.

43:20.453 --> 43:23.511
I believe
you have something for me.

43:23.611 --> 43:26.109
(Burst of dramatic music)

43:26.209 --> 43:28.648
(Phone vibrates)

43:37.762 --> 43:40.001
(Ringing tone)

43:44.118 --> 43:46.017
Good.

43:46.117 --> 43:48.355
Elliot will be here
in a few minutes.

43:52.033 --> 43:54.851
You can hand me the package now.

43:54.951 --> 43:57.709
I told you,
not before my boy gets here.

44:16.537 --> 44:18.536
(Scanner beeps)

44:30.528 --> 44:32.527
(Screams)

44:41.641 --> 44:44.919
(Music tempo slows)

45:10.782 --> 45:12.980
(Burst of dramatic music)

45:26.052 --> 45:28.211
(Charlie)
Listen to me, Elliot.

45:30.089 --> 45:32.088
Listen now.

45:34.926 --> 45:37.245
Don't let this destroy you.

45:40.563 --> 45:42.561
If you feel you're slipping...

45:45.799 --> 45:47.798
talk to me.

45:48.997 --> 45:50.996
Promise.

46:26.853 --> 46:28.711
(Creaking)

46:28.811 --> 46:30.810
(Gasps)

46:32.289 --> 46:34.288
Elliot.

46:34.887 --> 46:36.746
What's going on?

46:36.846 --> 46:38.845
Well...

46:40.564 --> 46:42.563
you murdered my father...

46:44.161 --> 46:46.820
you soulless fucking bitch.

46:46.920 --> 46:49.618
I've had no report that anything
has happened to your father.

46:49.718 --> 46:52.996
Here's your report! Here!

46:53.955 --> 46:56.493
I was there. I saw it.

46:56.593 --> 46:59.452
My daughter's in the house.
Let's go somewhere else and talk.

46:59.552 --> 47:03.409
You sent people to kill my dad,
and now you want to talk about it?

47:03.509 --> 47:07.286
Listen to me.
I don't make the decisions.

47:07.386 --> 47:09.585
I don't give the orders.
I just pass them on.

47:12.103 --> 47:15.481
I'm just like you.
I don't want to be a part of it.

47:15.581 --> 47:17.580
But I have no choice.

47:29.612 --> 47:32.250
(Grunts and groans)

47:37.487 --> 47:40.045
(Neighing)

47:48.120 --> 47:51.198
(Eerie droning)

48:36.369 --> 48:38.467
Is Elliot dead?

48:38.567 --> 48:43.964
No. He wasn't there.
Just Singer and the father.

48:48.961 --> 48:50.959
Okay.

49:00.833 --> 49:03.931
(Sean) Every address,
every transaction,

49:04.031 --> 49:07.289
their identities,
locations and connections.

49:07.389 --> 49:12.186
The Investors are so fucked.

49:28.655 --> 49:30.654
The city belongs to us now.

49:32.972 --> 49:35.091
(Dramatic music)

49:44.645 --> 49:46.643
Let's go.
