00:21.300 --> 00:23.170
- From the Penn & Teller Theater

00:23.170 --> 00:25.030
at the Rio Hotel in Las Vegas,

00:25.030 --> 00:29.600
here's our host,
Alyson Hannigan.

00:37.170 --> 00:39.200
- Thank you.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.200
Welcome to Penn and Teller "Fool Us."

00:44.200 --> 00:46.430
You know we've got
the best magicians.

00:46.430 --> 00:49.300
You know who they have to fool.
Let's not mess around.

00:49.300 --> 00:53.900
Let's get this show started
right now with Penn and Teller.

00:58.930 --> 01:01.930
A hug? Aww.

01:01.930 --> 01:04.530
Hello.

01:11.930 --> 01:15.100
As always any magician
who fools Penn and Teller

01:15.100 --> 01:17.630
earns a spot performing
in their world famous

01:17.630 --> 01:19.300
Vegas magic show.

01:19.300 --> 01:22.730
So let's get started and meet
our first fooler of the night.

01:24.630 --> 01:26.430
- When people find out
I'm a magician

01:26.430 --> 01:28.730
from Salem, Massachusetts,
they usually think

01:28.730 --> 01:33.430
pointy witch hats, cauldrons,
stuff like that.

01:33.430 --> 01:35.300
But outside
of the tourism industry,

01:35.300 --> 01:37.200
I've never once seen a person

01:37.200 --> 01:39.330
flying around
on a broom stick.

01:40.870 --> 01:43.700
The way that I started
to perform magic

01:43.700 --> 01:46.030
in a locked psychiatric unit

01:46.030 --> 01:49.070
was that I wanted to get into
the field of psychology

01:49.070 --> 01:51.200
but I didn't
have any experience.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.700
I thought, what better way
to get my foot in the door

01:53.700 --> 01:55.130
then to volunteer.

01:55.130 --> 01:58.270
Magic is a great way
to demonstrate to someone

01:58.270 --> 02:00.230
that their own perception
is flawed

02:00.230 --> 02:04.130
and there are many ways
we can misperceive reality.

02:04.130 --> 02:08.699
I continue to use magic
in my work now as a therapist

02:08.699 --> 02:12.070
to help people learn about how
they misperceive reality,

02:12.070 --> 02:16.430
and I working to help expose
and destroy that illusion.

02:21.500 --> 02:24.370
- Please welcome,
Tyler Twombly.

02:30.770 --> 02:32.830
- Penn.
Teller.

02:32.830 --> 02:35.330
Alyson.
People.

02:35.330 --> 02:37.900
I've come here
to share with you a secret.

02:37.900 --> 02:40.300
There is enormous potential
for magic

02:40.300 --> 02:44.030
in the world
of office supplies.

02:44.030 --> 02:46.230
Countless grand illusions
have been performed

02:46.230 --> 02:49.430
with mighty skill
on this large stage,

02:49.430 --> 02:51.500
and I've come waltzing out here
holding just a pad

02:51.500 --> 02:53.770
of sticky notes and a pen.

02:53.770 --> 02:56.170
At this point many of you
are definitely thinking,

02:56.170 --> 02:57.470
"You had me at office supplies.

02:57.470 --> 03:00.630
I'm sure
this will be fantastic."

03:00.630 --> 03:02.630
But in all earnestness,
the illusion that you're

03:02.630 --> 03:04.830
about to experience is small

03:04.830 --> 03:07.070
and you'll need
to come in very close.

03:07.070 --> 03:09.000
For your effort, however,
you'll be rewarded

03:09.000 --> 03:10.970
because what you will see
will change the way

03:10.970 --> 03:13.330
you look at these little pieces
of paper forever

03:13.330 --> 03:15.130
and prove that
the greatest magic

03:15.130 --> 03:17.730
happens at the smallest scale.

03:17.730 --> 03:20.300
So with that,
I'd like to invite Alyson

03:20.300 --> 03:22.570
to join me over here.
Thank you very much.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.100
- Hi.
- Hello, Alyson.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.730
Please stand right there.

03:28.730 --> 03:31.200
Now, Alyson.
- Yes.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.930
- These little pieces
of paper often carry

03:32.930 --> 03:34.800
simple, mundane reminders

03:34.800 --> 03:36.300
to go to
an important appointment

03:36.300 --> 03:38.700
with say, the dentist.
- Mm.

03:40.330 --> 03:42.400
Yeah.

03:42.400 --> 03:45.200
- But they can also be imbued
with much more meaning.

03:45.200 --> 03:49.900
Like the "I love you" note
placed in a school lunch box.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.730
Only to be
discovered by one

03:53.730 --> 03:55.330
maybe slightly
embarrassed child

03:55.330 --> 03:58.170
later that day at school.

03:58.170 --> 04:00.730
For our little paper miracle
to work,

04:00.730 --> 04:02.400
we can't just write
any old thing down.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.100
We need something
personally meaningful.

04:04.100 --> 04:05.400
- Oh.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.130
- So if you could please
give us the first initial

04:08.130 --> 04:10.330
of someone near
and dear to your heart,

04:10.330 --> 04:12.470
someone you love very much,
someone who has had

04:12.470 --> 04:16.670
an enormous impact
on the trajectory of your life.

04:16.670 --> 04:19.570
- Uh, okay. S.

04:19.570 --> 04:21.529
- S. Okay.

04:21.529 --> 04:24.400
I'm gonna draw two hearts
with an arrow between them

04:24.400 --> 04:26.800
because we're gonna do
something very interesting

04:26.800 --> 04:28.230
in just a moment.

04:31.070 --> 04:34.900
Now we're just getting started
but to really personalize this

04:34.900 --> 04:39.000
we'll put your initial,
which is A, in that heart

04:39.000 --> 04:43.800
and their initial, which is S,
in this heart.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.700
And we'll put a little bird
in the sky just to give it

04:45.700 --> 04:47.230
a little sense of depth,
don't you think?

04:47.230 --> 04:48.900
- Nice.
- Yeah.

04:48.900 --> 04:51.900
Two hearts,
at one point separated,

04:51.900 --> 04:54.630
by space and time
until one day,

04:54.630 --> 04:56.430
everything changed.
- Oh.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.970
- That's what
we're gonna do right now.

04:57.970 --> 05:00.870
We're gonna bring
those hearts together.

05:04.900 --> 05:07.530
- Aw.

05:09.970 --> 05:12.230
- That is for you.
- Thank you.

05:12.230 --> 05:13.570
- Thank you very much.
- All right.

05:13.570 --> 05:15.570
- It would be my greatest honor
if that one day

05:15.570 --> 05:17.970
wound up on your refrigerator.
- Perfect.

05:17.970 --> 05:19.370
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

05:19.370 --> 05:20.800
- Thank you so much.
You can go back.

05:22.770 --> 05:25.170
Thank you.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.030
Maybe it's just me,

05:29.030 --> 05:31.400
but I'm sensing
a little skepticism

05:31.400 --> 05:34.370
emanating
from this general area.

05:34.370 --> 05:35.630
Yes.

05:35.630 --> 05:37.670
The gentlemen in the suits.

05:37.670 --> 05:38.930
Uh, Teller.

05:38.930 --> 05:41.630
Could you please
join me up here on stage?

05:43.270 --> 05:45.500
Thank you very much.

05:47.330 --> 05:49.930
Thank you very much.

05:49.930 --> 05:51.900
Thank you for joining me.
It's an honor to meet you.

05:51.900 --> 05:53.870
You can stand right here.

05:53.870 --> 05:56.730
Now we're gonna have you
choose a letter

05:56.730 --> 05:58.970
but not just any letter.

05:58.970 --> 06:00.670
I'm sure when you were younger,

06:00.670 --> 06:01.970
just starting out
in your career,

06:01.970 --> 06:06.230
you had a big dream, a vision,
for your life, okay?

06:06.230 --> 06:08.830
I want you to think of
a big dream that you had

06:08.830 --> 06:11.900
that actually came true
and the winding path

06:11.900 --> 06:14.070
that the pursuit of that dream
took you down.

06:14.070 --> 06:15.700
All right, so...

06:15.700 --> 06:18.070
Just think of one letter
from the alphabet

06:18.070 --> 06:20.070
to represent that big dream

06:20.070 --> 06:22.400
and you can whisper it
right in my ear.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.930
Once you've thought of it.

06:24.930 --> 06:27.570
- C.

06:27.570 --> 06:29.330
- He can speak.

06:31.270 --> 06:34.430
Now we're gonna place
that dream inside

06:34.430 --> 06:36.470
a perfect little bubble.

06:40.470 --> 06:42.730
Eh, not totally perfect,

06:42.730 --> 06:44.570
but it'll do.

06:44.570 --> 06:47.630
This is Teller's dream.

06:47.630 --> 06:51.370
And this is where
we start to tell our story.

06:51.370 --> 06:54.630
Now in the beginning,
a dream is just a dream.

06:54.630 --> 06:56.000
It doesn't go anywhere.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.830
Until that initial exertion
of effort sends it off

06:59.830 --> 07:02.600
in some direction.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.530
Then you gotta
make some choices.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.870
You probably made some choices.

07:09.870 --> 07:12.470
Some good,
some maybe questionable.

07:12.470 --> 07:14.100
Sends it off in yet another.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.330
But then,
through a series of events,

07:16.330 --> 07:18.800
both serendipitous and planned,

07:18.800 --> 07:22.530
we wind up where we are
right here today.

07:22.530 --> 07:24.970
This is for you.

07:24.970 --> 07:26.900
And this is just
one single page

07:26.900 --> 07:29.670
in the story so far.
Thank you very much.

07:29.670 --> 07:32.400
Thank you so much.

07:32.400 --> 07:35.870
Thank you.
- Tyler Twombly.

07:40.200 --> 07:43.030
Hi, again.
- Hello.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.470
- Well, you had me
when you had a marker

07:45.470 --> 07:48.400
'cause I just love any sort
of office supplies so--

07:48.400 --> 07:50.030
- Me too.
- But that was fantastic.

07:50.030 --> 07:51.300
- Thank you.

07:51.300 --> 07:54.530
- Do all of your tricks
involve office supplies?

07:54.530 --> 07:56.430
- Whatever happens
to be around,

07:56.430 --> 07:57.870
generally speaking.

07:57.870 --> 07:59.330
- And do you work in an office?

07:59.330 --> 08:03.330
- Well, I used to,
and the origin of this trick

08:03.330 --> 08:04.770
started there.

08:04.770 --> 08:07.130
- And so what made
you interested in

08:07.130 --> 08:09.700
doing magic here on "Fool Us?"

08:09.700 --> 08:12.430
- Well, I didn't think

08:12.430 --> 08:15.570
that I would ever do a show

08:15.570 --> 08:18.700
like this, but here I am.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.770
Surprise.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.900
- So do you think you'll fool
Penn and Teller?

08:25.900 --> 08:27.600
- No.
- No?

08:27.600 --> 08:29.600
Really?
No.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.000
That's honest.
- Yeah.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.970
- Yeah.
- I mean, I like that

08:32.970 --> 08:34.530
they're still talking.
- Yeah.

08:34.530 --> 08:37.500
- Yeah.
Very dramatic furrowed brow.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.870
- All right, well, it's time
to go to Penn and Teller.

08:39.870 --> 08:41.770
Let's see
if you fooled them or not.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.600
- All right.
- Yeah.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.600
- Uh, you know,
you told the truth, Tyler,

08:45.600 --> 08:46.830
right at the beginning.

08:46.830 --> 08:49.800
You know, you had us
at office supplies.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.570
That's when we loved you,
we loved you

08:51.570 --> 08:53.730
right on the office supplies.
It's just--

08:53.730 --> 08:56.270
it's just a really funny line
and it's also really true.

08:56.270 --> 08:58.330
We also love about this

08:58.330 --> 09:01.770
is that so often in magic,

09:01.770 --> 09:05.000
the props that you're showing

09:05.000 --> 09:07.230
are not all the props
you're using,

09:07.230 --> 09:11.270
but we believe that everything
you're using, we see.

09:11.270 --> 09:13.770
It comes from the--
it comes from the Post-it pad.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.200
It's really--
it's really fabulous.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.870
And, uh, we also love the fact
that it deals with love

09:18.870 --> 09:20.800
and how hearts can move around.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.970
You know, you love one person
then love another

09:22.970 --> 09:24.870
and things move
from one place to the other.

09:24.870 --> 09:27.130
It also made me think of, um,

09:27.130 --> 09:29.600
you know, still haven't found
what I'm looking for.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.800
I don't know
if you're a U2 fan at all,

09:31.800 --> 09:34.700
but sometimes when--when--
when U2's playing

09:34.700 --> 09:37.830
and Bono moves right in front
of the guitar player,

09:37.830 --> 09:39.900
and for a moment,
he just covers up,

09:39.900 --> 09:41.630
well, the base player
at one time

09:41.630 --> 09:43.130
and maybe the drummer
another time

09:43.130 --> 09:45.630
and maybe the guitar player
at another time,

09:45.630 --> 09:48.770
he covers up when he moves
in front of them, you know?

09:48.770 --> 09:51.700
And you just think that
his heart is moving right over

09:51.700 --> 09:53.600
the guitar player in that way

09:53.600 --> 09:55.970
and uh--
but I'm getting off into music.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.700
I'm really supposed to be
talking about magic,

09:57.700 --> 10:00.830
but we really love the act,
love the office supplies.

10:00.830 --> 10:02.500
And I should get
really back to magic,

10:02.500 --> 10:05.800
but you know our hearts moving
around all over the place.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.970
- Did any of that
make sense to you?

10:07.970 --> 10:10.800
- I think so.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.230
I--you know...

10:12.230 --> 10:14.400
His code is so good.
- I know.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.170
- It's so good.
- It's so annoying.

10:16.170 --> 10:17.430
- I think--

10:17.430 --> 10:20.200
I think they got it,
and I'm okay with that.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.600
- Okay.
All right.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.400
So you didn't fool them,

10:24.400 --> 10:27.200
but we appreciate you coming.
- Thank you.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.100
- Tyler Twombly.

10:35.130 --> 10:37.500
Penn and Teller
saw through that last trick

10:37.500 --> 10:39.030
but they're not
off the hook yet.

10:39.030 --> 10:41.900
More foolers
and more "Fool Us" coming up.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.030
- Welcome back to "Fool Us."

10:57.030 --> 10:58.430
Let's see if our next magician

10:58.430 --> 11:00.830
can play Penn and Teller
for fools.

11:00.830 --> 11:01.830
Take a look.

11:03.870 --> 11:06.100
- When I was young,
I used to be a fan

11:06.100 --> 11:08.600
of all the old time TV shows
like "The Twilight Zone"

11:08.600 --> 11:12.500
and, of course, I loved magic
and I loved animals.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.300
I studied veterinary
medicine in Italy,

11:15.300 --> 11:17.700
all the while paying my way
through school with magic.

11:17.700 --> 11:20.000
I really like doing
coin magic in the hospital

11:20.000 --> 11:21.670
because a little boy
or girl comes in

11:21.670 --> 11:23.800
worried about
their sick dog or cat,

11:23.800 --> 11:26.270
and all I have to do is pull
a coin out of that dog's ear

11:26.270 --> 11:28.400
and their frown
turns into a smile.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.300
Dogs and cats can't tell you
what's going on.

11:30.300 --> 11:32.800
You have to figure that out,
and that's the challenge.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.130
The challenge of magic
is to find a new way

11:35.130 --> 11:37.970
to do an effect that makes it
look even more impressive.

11:37.970 --> 11:40.970
I like to tell people that
I have a love of magic

11:40.970 --> 11:42.700
but my life
is veterinary medicine.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.030
Not bad for a day's work,
right?

11:44.030 --> 11:47.200
Of course on other days,
it's the other way around.

11:50.770 --> 11:55.670
- Please welcome the coin magic
of Dr. Michael Rubinstein.

12:00.730 --> 12:02.870
- I've always enjoyed
watching reruns

12:02.870 --> 12:06.430
of my favorite classic TV show,
"The Twilight Zone."

12:06.430 --> 12:08.570
I love that each episode
revolves around tales

12:08.570 --> 12:11.600
of the strange,
the macabre, and the magical.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.170
Tonight, I'd like to combine
my love of that show

12:14.170 --> 12:15.700
with my passion for coin magic

12:15.700 --> 12:18.600
and tell you a story created
especially for this occasion.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.730
So please allow me to channel
my best Rod Serling

12:21.730 --> 12:24.730
as I take you all on
a magical journey into

12:24.730 --> 12:27.370
the "Fool Us" Zone.

12:27.370 --> 12:29.270
You walk through the doors
of this theater

12:29.270 --> 12:31.970
and enter
a magical dimension.

12:31.970 --> 12:35.330
A dimension of Penn.
A dimension of Teller.

12:35.330 --> 12:37.930
A dimension of
prestidigitation.

12:37.930 --> 12:40.030
You're put into
a suggestive state

12:40.030 --> 12:42.000
of smoke and mirrors.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.470
You just punched your ticket
for the "Fool Us" Zone.

12:54.330 --> 12:56.800
The word alchemy,
by definition,

12:56.800 --> 12:58.900
the magical mutation of metal.

12:58.900 --> 13:01.530
A mythical power
often attributed to wizards

13:01.530 --> 13:04.070
from a time
long since passed by.

13:04.070 --> 13:06.600
But although myths are
dismissed as tales of fantasy

13:06.600 --> 13:08.670
left to be told
to gullible children,

13:08.670 --> 13:11.970
there exists within each
of them a modicum of truth,

13:11.970 --> 13:14.200
and to that I point you
toward an incident

13:14.200 --> 13:16.830
which occurred back in 1931.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.600
The place, a street
in the center of London,

13:19.600 --> 13:21.270
and if you were to
look through the crowd

13:21.270 --> 13:24.200
you might see on the corner
a man shining shoes.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.730
That man is George Midas.

13:25.730 --> 13:28.800
A poor man beat down by
the hardships of his life.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.870
But in a few brief moments,
that life will change.

13:31.870 --> 13:33.730
For George Midas
is about to receive

13:33.730 --> 13:37.770
a golden opportunity to enter
the "Fool Us" Zone.

13:41.730 --> 13:43.600
So there's George
shining shoes.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.700
At the end of the day he takes
a look into his tip cup,

13:45.700 --> 13:47.470
but he didn't do very well.

13:47.470 --> 13:49.030
One,

13:49.030 --> 13:50.570
two,

13:50.570 --> 13:51.870
three,

13:51.870 --> 13:54.130
four old and dusty
copper pennies.

13:54.130 --> 13:56.330
Not even enough to buy
his evening's meal.

13:56.330 --> 13:59.270
And he realized that once again
he'd have to go home hungry

13:59.270 --> 14:01.400
and talk to his wife
about the poverty

14:01.400 --> 14:03.000
in which they lived.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.470
He picked up
one of the old

14:04.470 --> 14:05.900
and dusty pennies,

14:05.900 --> 14:08.900
and without thinking,
removed a speck of dust,

14:08.900 --> 14:11.000
but when he looked back
George was surprised to see

14:11.000 --> 14:14.100
a coin of gold, solid gold.

14:14.100 --> 14:15.630
George couldn't
believe his eyes,

14:15.630 --> 14:17.330
but he realized that
with all of that gold

14:17.330 --> 14:20.330
he now had enough money to pay
all of his back rent.

14:20.330 --> 14:22.730
He put that coin away
for safe keeping

14:22.730 --> 14:25.870
and picked up the second
old and dusty penny.

14:25.870 --> 14:28.770
Just like the first
he removed a speck of dust,

14:28.770 --> 14:30.900
and like the first
that coin changed to gold.

14:30.900 --> 14:33.370
Solid gold.

14:33.370 --> 14:35.970
And as George gazed upon
that shiny gold penny

14:35.970 --> 14:37.730
he realized
that he now had enough money

14:37.730 --> 14:40.030
to put food on the table
for a month.

14:40.030 --> 14:42.430
He put that coin away
as well

14:42.430 --> 14:45.870
and picked up the third
old and dusty penny.

14:45.870 --> 14:48.730
With hands now trembling,
he removed a speck of dust,

14:48.730 --> 14:51.000
and as before
that coin changed to gold.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.600
Solid gold.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.270
George's smile got bigger,

14:54.270 --> 14:56.000
for he realized that
he now had enough money

14:56.000 --> 14:58.870
to buy brand-new clothes
for his entire family.

14:58.870 --> 15:01.870
And as he put that coin away,
George spied one last coin

15:01.870 --> 15:03.500
sitting on the table.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.270
He picked it up
and he pondered.

15:05.270 --> 15:08.000
Could the magic happen
yet one more time?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.770
He rubbed that coin
on his sleeve,

15:09.770 --> 15:11.900
revealing, once again,
a coin of gold.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.130
Solid gold.

15:14.130 --> 15:16.800
But as George played around
with that shiny, gold penny....

15:16.800 --> 15:19.400
He stopped thinking of all
of the good and wondrous things

15:19.400 --> 15:22.100
he was going to do
for his family. For you see,

15:22.100 --> 15:24.600
George now realized
that he had the power.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.430
And he was going
to use that power

15:26.430 --> 15:29.270
not for good, but to get back
at all of the people

15:29.270 --> 15:30.670
who beat him down

15:30.670 --> 15:32.900
and put him
into a state of poverty.

15:32.900 --> 15:35.470
And at that very moment,
at that very moment,

15:35.470 --> 15:38.830
that shiny gold penny
changed back...

15:38.830 --> 15:41.500
to copper.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.370
When George saw what had
happened his smile faded,

15:44.370 --> 15:47.600
for he realized that the magic
had only been fleeting.

15:47.600 --> 15:50.770
And in fact, when he took
a look back into his cup...

15:52.130 --> 15:53.500
he found that
all of the shiny gold

15:53.500 --> 15:56.530
had changed back to copper.

15:56.530 --> 15:58.530
And as George
looked on in despair...

15:58.530 --> 16:01.870
It was as if you could hear
the voice of Rod Serling,

16:01.870 --> 16:04.870
who said,
"Yes, George Midas,

16:04.870 --> 16:08.270
a man who possessed
a true gift.

16:08.270 --> 16:11.500
A real Midas touch.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.270
But gifts used
for the wrong reasons,

16:13.270 --> 16:17.030
can also be taken away
back to the refund counters

16:17.030 --> 16:20.700
found only in the stores
of the 'Fool Us' Zone."

16:20.700 --> 16:22.330
Thank you.

16:23.900 --> 16:27.300
- Dr. Michael Rubinstein.

16:27.300 --> 16:30.830
Ooh, hi, nice to meet you.

16:30.830 --> 16:33.900
Ah, I really--I love
"The Twilight Zone" as well.

16:33.900 --> 16:35.200
- Thank you.
One of my favorites.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.470
- Yeah, so I really liked
the ambience.

16:37.470 --> 16:41.800
Um, and you use actual, like,
old coins I heard.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.430
- I do.
I think that older coins

16:43.430 --> 16:45.730
are more, um, interesting

16:45.730 --> 16:47.730
and of course there's
an intrinsic value

16:47.730 --> 16:50.100
so these coins that I used
were like from 1915.

16:50.100 --> 16:51.670
- That's fantastic.
- So it really fits

16:51.670 --> 16:52.930
the ambience of
"The Twilight Zone,"

16:52.930 --> 16:54.200
there being the old England.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.070
- Is this your favorite
coin trick?

16:56.070 --> 16:58.570
- Yes, it's--it's basically
a piece of magical theater

16:58.570 --> 17:00.030
that's developed
over the course

17:00.030 --> 17:01.170
of the last 30 years.

17:01.170 --> 17:02.730
I've done it
in different ways,

17:02.730 --> 17:04.800
but I really built it up
so that it's more like,

17:04.800 --> 17:07.530
as I said, a piece of theater
where the magic is only, like,

17:07.530 --> 17:09.800
part of the story,
it's not the story

17:09.800 --> 17:12.170
but it basically
complements the story.

17:12.170 --> 17:14.000
- That's pretty cool.
- Thank you.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.630
- Okay.
Penn and Teller are ready.

17:15.630 --> 17:17.270
Let's see if you fooled them.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.369
Penn, Teller.

17:19.369 --> 17:21.369
- Ah, Dr. Michael, very nice.

17:21.369 --> 17:22.730
Very, very nice.

17:25.329 --> 17:27.829
In magic, people do
storytelling all the time

17:27.829 --> 17:29.670
but not in coin magic.

17:29.670 --> 17:32.300
Coin magic is usually--
there's this, then it changes

17:32.300 --> 17:33.600
to something else.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.270
And you just had
a whole story behind there

17:35.270 --> 17:36.700
that just kept us spellbound.

17:36.700 --> 17:38.400
It was just wonderful
how you, uh--

17:38.400 --> 17:39.900
how you told the whole thing
through there.

17:39.900 --> 17:42.430
We're both, uh,
big "Twilight Zone" fans.

17:42.430 --> 17:43.930
So we absolutely loved that.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.330
I loved that
it gave a justification.

17:46.330 --> 17:48.900
Usually the coins
are just color changing,

17:48.900 --> 17:50.730
and you actually gave them
value change

17:50.730 --> 17:53.170
and gave a story.
We found it really interesting

17:53.170 --> 17:56.970
that on many coins it has
"E pluribus unum"

17:56.970 --> 17:58.930
as a symbol of
United States of America.

17:58.930 --> 18:01.130
But since Teller
was a Latin scholar,

18:01.130 --> 18:04.070
a little bit more
of how you did it

18:04.070 --> 18:08.530
was "ex uno plures"
more than the other way around.

18:08.530 --> 18:11.670
We also gonna just use some--
a little bit of jargon here,

18:11.670 --> 18:13.370
'cause I love doing that,

18:13.370 --> 18:15.730
and we're just gonna say
something magician to magician.

18:15.730 --> 18:18.970
There was a nice variation
on the Ramsay Subtlety

18:18.970 --> 18:20.400
that we saw you doing.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.800
But we--we loved it there
and I think we probably

18:23.800 --> 18:25.930
with Latin and magic terms,

18:25.930 --> 18:27.830
I think maybe
we got some stuff there.

18:27.830 --> 18:29.470
You--you agree with us?

18:29.470 --> 18:31.570
- I don't speak Latin
or magician.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.030
- One thing I would ask is,

18:33.030 --> 18:36.670
the most important part of this
trick for me is how--

18:36.670 --> 18:39.300
the cleanliness
in which the trick finished,

18:39.300 --> 18:41.430
and I was wondering
if that was important for you?

18:42.700 --> 18:44.330
- Because when you deal
with four dirty coins

18:44.330 --> 18:45.600
you gotta keep
your hands clean.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.830
- Yeah, well, that to us,
although we loved it,

18:47.830 --> 18:51.330
was not that important
a mat-ter.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.300
- Well, that meant
nothing to me.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.870
Did it mean something to you?
- Yes, it did.

18:54.870 --> 18:56.500
- Okay, so you didn't--
- They're good.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.970
- You didn't fool them?
Well, thank you.

18:58.970 --> 19:01.530
Dr. Michael Rubinstein.
- Thank you.

19:06.370 --> 19:08.700
Someone is gonna
catch Penn and Teller

19:08.700 --> 19:10.030
off guard eventually.

19:10.030 --> 19:11.800
It just might happen
after this,

19:11.800 --> 19:13.270
so stick around.

19:25.730 --> 19:26.900
- Welcome back.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.970
No one has fooled
Penn and Teller yet.

19:28.970 --> 19:31.930
Let's find out if our next act
has what it takes.

19:31.930 --> 19:33.000
Take a look.

19:35.030 --> 19:37.700
- My name is Anastasia Synn.
I'm a magician.

19:37.700 --> 19:40.100
I live in a very
picturesque community.

19:41.570 --> 19:44.570
My show involves both magic
and side show.

19:44.570 --> 19:46.070
When I first
started performing,

19:46.070 --> 19:47.800
I went from
doing tricks behind a bar

19:47.800 --> 19:49.530
where I was working,
to performing

19:49.530 --> 19:52.100
a razor blade swallowing act
for teenage girls

19:52.100 --> 19:53.900
and watching them run away
screaming and crying,

19:53.900 --> 19:55.500
and it was the reaction
that hooked me.

19:57.600 --> 20:01.330
If you thought that was cool,
let me show you this.

20:02.730 --> 20:05.470
I have seven implants
in my body right now.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.100
Sensors in the tips
of my fingers.

20:07.100 --> 20:08.800
I have sensors
in the backs of my wrists.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.870
One under my arm that
gives me my body temperature.

20:10.870 --> 20:14.100
And in my hand here,
can be scanned by a phone

20:14.100 --> 20:16.470
and can either
give you messages

20:16.470 --> 20:19.430
or I can program it to open
hotel doors when we're on tour.

20:19.430 --> 20:22.170
Tonight, I'm gonna show you
what a body can do.

20:28.400 --> 20:32.130
- Here for your enjoyment,
Anastasia Synn.

22:29.470 --> 22:31.630
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

22:31.630 --> 22:35.630
- No, no, no, no, no.

23:01.070 --> 23:02.670
- Whoo!

23:02.670 --> 23:05.030
- Eh.

23:09.970 --> 23:12.670
- Just hold it tight and stay still.

23:12.670 --> 23:15.530
- Okay.
Ugh.

23:17.530 --> 23:18.300
Ugh.

23:37.830 --> 23:39.230
Oh.

23:48.570 --> 23:51.170
Oh, my goodness.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.770
Oh, my God.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.600
Ugh.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.470
Oh, my goodness.

24:16.470 --> 24:18.870
Thank you.

24:25.100 --> 24:27.030
Anastasia Synn.

24:28.330 --> 24:29.970
Ugh.

24:29.970 --> 24:31.770
Ugh.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.070
Yeah.
- Hi.

24:33.070 --> 24:34.900
- Hi.
I'm glad you're happy.

24:34.900 --> 24:36.270
- I'm really happy.
- Oh.

24:36.270 --> 24:38.400
That's gonna give me
a lot of nightmares.

24:38.400 --> 24:39.700
- Is it?
- Yeah.

24:39.700 --> 24:41.400
- Why do they keep
calling you Alyson?

24:41.400 --> 24:43.670
Your name's Willow.
- Oh.

24:43.670 --> 24:45.100
Yeah, I get that a bunch too.

24:45.100 --> 24:46.230
- Do you?
- Yeah.

24:46.230 --> 24:47.530
- Actually, I have
a present for you.

24:47.530 --> 24:48.770
- You do?
- I do. I have a present for you.

24:48.770 --> 24:50.070
- Does it come out
of your body?

24:50.070 --> 24:51.270
- It does.
- Oh.

24:51.270 --> 24:53.930
Whoo, there's a lot
going on in there.

24:53.930 --> 24:55.470
- Pink sweater Willow.
- Aw.

24:55.470 --> 24:56.730
- I love Willow.
That's for you.

24:56.730 --> 24:57.870
- Thank you.
I can keep this?

24:57.870 --> 25:00.300
- Yes, that's for you.
- Aw. Thank you.

25:00.300 --> 25:01.730
Aw, well, now I forgive you

25:01.730 --> 25:03.370
for all the nightmares
that I'm gonna have.

25:03.370 --> 25:05.470
- Oh, yay!
That makes me happy.

25:05.470 --> 25:07.030
- Um, so I just--

25:07.030 --> 25:09.800
I don't even know where
to begin, like...

25:09.800 --> 25:14.230
How do you decide, yes--
and you're bleeding by the way.

25:14.230 --> 25:16.200
Ugh.
Ouch.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.630
Okay.
- I'm sorry.

25:17.630 --> 25:20.470
- No, it's like, funny
and gross all at the same time.

25:20.470 --> 25:21.730
- I try.

25:21.730 --> 25:24.100
- So did performing
come naturally to you?

25:24.100 --> 25:26.070
- Um, no actually,
it took me about two years

25:26.070 --> 25:28.500
to get out of--or over
my stage fright.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.070
It was brutal stage fright, like--

25:30.070 --> 25:31.470
- Really?
- I felt like someone

25:31.470 --> 25:33.430
punched me in the stomach
every time I went out on stage.

25:33.430 --> 25:38.430
And as soon as I kind of
adopted some sideshowy style

25:38.430 --> 25:41.130
that scared people
more than it scared me,

25:41.130 --> 25:43.370
it kind of took care
of the stage fright issue.

25:43.370 --> 25:45.130
- Oh, that's cool.

25:45.130 --> 25:46.970
All right, well,
let's go to Penn and Teller

25:46.970 --> 25:48.330
and see if you fooled them.

25:48.330 --> 25:50.000
Penn, Teller.

25:50.000 --> 25:54.530
- Ah, the most amazing thing
about, uh, this is that, um,

25:54.530 --> 25:57.770
some of this
is absolutely real,

25:57.770 --> 26:01.800
some of it is partially real,
some of it's not real,

26:01.800 --> 26:04.730
and believe me, if we told
in detail which was which,

26:04.730 --> 26:06.330
people would be freaked out.

26:06.330 --> 26:07.730
- Yes.

26:07.730 --> 26:10.830
- 'Cause the fact that the stuff
that isn't real

26:10.830 --> 26:13.070
is the trivial stuff
and the fact that the stuff

26:13.070 --> 26:15.270
that is real
is the freak-out stuff

26:15.270 --> 26:16.500
is really good.

26:16.500 --> 26:19.330
We have a lot of acts,
uh, on this show.

26:19.330 --> 26:21.130
We know a lot of magic,
we've been doing magic

26:21.130 --> 26:23.770
for a long time.
And most of the acts

26:23.770 --> 26:26.900
that we see out here,
with practice, with work,

26:26.900 --> 26:31.630
with study, with rehearsal,
we could do.

26:31.630 --> 26:34.200
The stuff that you do,
we couldn't do.

26:34.200 --> 26:38.270
We just plain do not have
the stomach for it.

26:38.270 --> 26:40.830
You're just so much tougher
than we are.

26:40.830 --> 26:43.330
She is tough enough,
rough enough,

26:43.330 --> 26:45.070
in love enough,
and rich enough.

26:45.070 --> 26:47.400
- So this is the first time
I'm really glad

26:47.400 --> 26:50.330
they talked in code, because
I don't think I need to know.

26:50.330 --> 26:52.570
- Oh, Alyson,
you so don't want to know.

26:52.570 --> 26:55.100
- No.
- You so don't wanna know.

26:55.100 --> 26:56.700
- No.
- Oh, you don't wanna know.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.200
- I know you know
what I'm doing.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.400
- Don't even ask me.
- Yes, okay, good.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.500
So, Anastasia Synn.
- It's a great act.

27:02.500 --> 27:05.870
Thank you Anastasia.
Thanks for coming on.

27:08.100 --> 27:10.700
- Up next,
more of TV's best magic,

27:10.700 --> 27:12.830
including a trick
by our very own

27:12.830 --> 27:14.230
Penn and Teller.

27:14.230 --> 27:15.870
Stay close.

27:28.230 --> 27:30.200
- Welcome back to "Fool Us."

27:30.200 --> 27:32.700
Our next magician has one
of the more interesting

27:32.700 --> 27:34.630
backstories of any fooler.

27:34.630 --> 27:35.870
Check it out.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.670
- I'm Adam Cheyer,

27:39.670 --> 27:41.300
co-creator of Siri,

27:41.300 --> 27:43.670
the voice assistant
on Apple devices.

27:43.670 --> 27:46.670
I started out with magic
at nine years old.

27:46.670 --> 27:48.270
A Rubik's Cube.

27:48.270 --> 27:50.170
For me, that was
a form of magic.

27:50.170 --> 27:53.370
And, in fact, the first piece
of software I ever wrote,

27:53.370 --> 27:56.800
was a program
to solve Rubik's Cube.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.900
Entrepreneurs and magicians
are very similar.

27:59.900 --> 28:02.770
Both have to imagine
an impossible future

28:02.770 --> 28:04.700
and the technology behind it.

28:04.700 --> 28:07.900
Many of my creations
were things that people

28:07.900 --> 28:09.430
did not believe were possible.

28:09.430 --> 28:11.800
That really shows
the relationship between

28:11.800 --> 28:14.700
technology and magic.

28:18.600 --> 28:21.870
- Please welcome
Siri-ous contender,

28:21.870 --> 28:23.930
Adam Cheyer.

28:26.770 --> 28:28.000
- Hello.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.270
I'm here today
to reveal to you my secrets.

28:32.270 --> 28:34.930
Entrepreneurs.

28:34.930 --> 28:37.630
The first thing
when you have a big idea

28:37.630 --> 28:40.370
is you need
to create a prototype

28:40.370 --> 28:44.570
that shows the world
of your future idea.

28:44.570 --> 28:46.730
I've happened
to bring with me today

28:46.730 --> 28:49.170
my first prototype of Siri.

28:49.170 --> 28:50.930
Would you like to see it?
- Yes.

28:52.270 --> 28:55.700
- I keep it in a little box.

28:57.870 --> 29:01.400
Once you have an idea
and a prototype,

29:01.400 --> 29:04.570
you need investors to fund
your id--your company.

29:04.570 --> 29:06.630
Penn and Teller,
would you join me on stage?

29:06.630 --> 29:08.970
You can be the ones
I'm trying to impress.

29:16.700 --> 29:19.670
I'm gonna mix these cards,
give them a shuffle.

29:28.570 --> 29:33.400
When I started Siri in 2007,

29:33.400 --> 29:35.170
people would say,

29:35.170 --> 29:37.670
"I have Google.
I have an iPhone.

29:37.670 --> 29:39.600
Why do I need anything else?"

29:39.600 --> 29:43.630
And I said, "Siri will be
better in three ways."

29:43.630 --> 29:46.000
First, when you put a keyword
into a search engine,

29:46.000 --> 29:47.830
it just gives you links.

29:47.830 --> 29:50.700
Siri is gonna
answer the question.

29:50.700 --> 29:55.100
Number two, I want to be able
to handle multiple tasks

29:55.100 --> 29:56.900
at the same time.

29:56.900 --> 29:59.730
And number three,
I want to be able to refine

29:59.730 --> 30:02.470
my questions conversationally.
"How about Tuesday?

30:02.470 --> 30:04.030
What about the next day?"

30:04.030 --> 30:05.930
Would you help me, Teller,

30:05.930 --> 30:08.300
and just choose any card
from the shuffled deck?

30:08.300 --> 30:11.030
Just--but don't look at it,
just pull it out of the deck.

30:12.700 --> 30:17.100
Okay and let's choose a card
for Penn as well.

30:21.400 --> 30:24.030
Let me show you how
this is going to work.

30:24.030 --> 30:27.900
On the back of every card,
I have a little button.

30:27.900 --> 30:30.200
What you do is you press it.

30:30.200 --> 30:31.430
Doo, doo.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.530
No, I was just kidding.

30:33.530 --> 30:36.530
We didn't actually implement
speech recognition

30:36.530 --> 30:38.800
in our first prototype of Siri.

30:38.800 --> 30:41.100
It turns out some people
don't actually like

30:41.100 --> 30:43.530
to talk to phones.

30:43.530 --> 30:46.330
But no matter.

30:46.330 --> 30:49.370
No worries, you can actually
type your questions.

30:49.370 --> 30:52.630
So Teller,
you chose a card at random.

30:52.630 --> 30:56.430
It could be red
or it could be black.

30:56.430 --> 30:59.630
What color is Teller's card?

30:59.630 --> 31:03.830
C-O-L-O-R.

31:03.830 --> 31:05.530
Color.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.400
And Siri says...

31:10.100 --> 31:11.530
Red.

31:11.530 --> 31:13.430
Maybe.

31:13.430 --> 31:17.330
Next, your card, it could be
a six, a two, a king.

31:17.330 --> 31:20.330
Let's ask.
What number is the card?

31:20.330 --> 31:24.970
N-U-M-B-E-R.

31:24.970 --> 31:27.070
Number.

31:27.070 --> 31:28.870
The answer is...

31:31.430 --> 31:34.170
A three,
a red three.

31:34.170 --> 31:36.970
Now if it's red,
it could be diamonds

31:36.970 --> 31:38.930
or it could be hearts.

31:38.930 --> 31:40.370
Is it hearts?

31:40.370 --> 31:44.470
H-E-A-R-T-S.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.900
It is hearts.

31:48.900 --> 31:51.200
Maybe.

31:51.200 --> 31:54.530
And every card in the deck
has exactly one match.

31:54.530 --> 31:56.230
So if I were to ask...

31:56.230 --> 31:58.770
M-A-T-C-H.

31:58.770 --> 32:00.200
For the match.

32:00.200 --> 32:03.500
Now I know there's no way
this could work,

32:03.500 --> 32:05.930
but if this were true,
it's saying your card, Teller,

32:05.930 --> 32:08.970
was the red three of hearts.

32:08.970 --> 32:13.130
So the match would be
the other red three.

32:13.130 --> 32:16.770
The red three of diamonds.

32:20.170 --> 32:23.930
That's what I call artificial
intelligence right--right there.

32:23.930 --> 32:27.170
And you chose
the red three of hearts.

32:33.670 --> 32:37.000
Now, we've said that Siri
can answer the question.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.670
I can refine my question
conversationally.

32:39.670 --> 32:41.800
Is it red?
Is it diamonds?

32:41.800 --> 32:44.670
But we also said,
we're going to handle

32:44.670 --> 32:47.270
multiple tasks
at the same time.

32:47.270 --> 32:50.900
Now, Penn,
we chose a card for you.

32:50.900 --> 32:53.600
This was the color pile.

32:53.600 --> 32:55.900
What is the color
of Penn's card?

32:59.430 --> 33:01.430
Black.

33:01.430 --> 33:04.300
This is the number pile.

33:04.300 --> 33:08.470
What number is Penn's card?

33:08.470 --> 33:10.770
Seven.
Black seven.

33:10.770 --> 33:14.700
If it's black it could be clubs
or it could be spades.

33:14.700 --> 33:17.730
Siri says, clubs.

33:17.730 --> 33:22.430
And every card in the deck
has exactly one match.

33:22.430 --> 33:26.230
And if you chose
the black seven of clubs,

33:26.230 --> 33:29.330
the match would be the--
the other black seven.

33:29.330 --> 33:31.870
The black seven of spades.

33:36.930 --> 33:39.200
And that means
the card that you chose

33:39.200 --> 33:41.170
would be the black...

33:44.270 --> 33:45.830
Thank you very much.
- Thank you so much, man.

33:45.830 --> 33:47.730
Thank you.
- Thank you.

33:47.730 --> 33:50.730
- Adam Cheyer.

33:54.700 --> 33:57.030
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

33:57.030 --> 33:59.330
You could stay in bed
for the rest of your life

33:59.330 --> 34:02.200
and do nothing else
and still be very impressive.

34:02.200 --> 34:04.430
- Yeah,
I aspire to be a magician

34:04.430 --> 34:05.830
like all the others
on this stage.

34:05.830 --> 34:07.570
- That's amazing.

34:07.570 --> 34:10.230
Um, I have so many questions
about Siri.

34:10.230 --> 34:12.170
Like, sometimes
you can get Siri

34:12.170 --> 34:13.500
to have a little bit
of an attitude.

34:13.500 --> 34:16.100
- Well, we knew when we
created Siri that, yes,

34:16.100 --> 34:17.800
we wanted it
to answer questions

34:17.800 --> 34:20.370
and do tasks for you.
But we knew that people

34:20.370 --> 34:23.070
would ask those
funny kinds of questions.

34:23.070 --> 34:26.300
So do you know what
the number one question

34:26.300 --> 34:28.800
that people ask Siri?
I've seen the logs.

34:28.800 --> 34:31.270
- Oh, is it, um, sing for me?

34:31.270 --> 34:33.969
- Very close. That's in the--
that's in the top ten.

34:33.969 --> 34:36.030
- Yes!
- The number one question

34:36.030 --> 34:39.270
that people ask Siri is,
"Do you love me?"

34:39.270 --> 34:40.670
- Aw.

34:40.670 --> 34:43.100
- And we built in
that kind of functionality

34:43.100 --> 34:44.969
into our prototype,
let--let me show you.

34:44.969 --> 34:46.070
- Okay.

34:46.070 --> 34:48.230
- Siri, do you love me?

34:48.230 --> 34:52.070
L-O-V-E.

34:52.070 --> 34:54.199
And Siri says...

34:54.199 --> 34:56.100
- Aw.
- She gives me her heart.

34:56.100 --> 34:59.330
- Aw, that's fantastic.

35:00.830 --> 35:04.530
So have you been performing
magic your whole life as well?

35:04.530 --> 35:07.670
- I--I was really into magic
when I was a kid,

35:07.670 --> 35:09.330
maybe eight to twelve.

35:09.330 --> 35:13.500
And then I went for 35 years
not doing any magic.

35:13.500 --> 35:17.000
And then when my son became
about the age that I was,

35:17.000 --> 35:18.630
we rediscovered magic together

35:18.630 --> 35:20.070
and that's something
we can share.

35:20.070 --> 35:22.000
- All right, well,
I bet he's excited.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.500
Um, all right, well,
let's go to the boys.

35:24.500 --> 35:25.930
- Okay.
- See if you tricked them.

35:25.930 --> 35:28.430
- Oh, Adam, we could--
we could not be more honored.

35:28.430 --> 35:29.930
Thank you so much
for doing our little show.

35:29.930 --> 35:31.330
- The honor is mine.
Thank you.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.430
- It's so great you wanted
to come on. I mean, uh...

35:33.430 --> 35:36.200
Someone that's really,
really been part of

35:36.200 --> 35:38.500
changing our culture,
changing the future.

35:38.500 --> 35:40.500
When I say "our,"
I don't mean Americans,

35:40.500 --> 35:41.830
I mean humanity.

35:41.830 --> 35:44.130
Uh, you've just done so much.

35:44.130 --> 35:45.470
So thrilled
you came on this show,

35:45.470 --> 35:46.600
thank you so much.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.400
Thank you so much
for doing it.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.500
And uh...

35:52.500 --> 35:54.900
You know, I'm trying
to find ways that, eh,

35:54.900 --> 35:58.000
that we have things in common,
'cause you're such a hero.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.230
One way is you--you shuffled cards
a lot like we do some times.

36:01.230 --> 36:03.930
I really liked that a lot,
but I think the best way

36:03.930 --> 36:08.030
to try to figure out how
you did this is to ask Siri.

36:08.030 --> 36:11.670
Hey, Siri!
How did Adam

36:11.670 --> 36:14.870
do that great trick?

36:14.870 --> 36:15.930
- Oh.

36:15.930 --> 36:18.700
I think he used
a circular stack

36:18.700 --> 36:21.370
like Si Stebbins.

36:21.370 --> 36:24.670
- Was it his own--was it one
he developed himself?

36:24.670 --> 36:26.670
- I don't know,
but if he did,

36:26.670 --> 36:29.500
he's even smarter
than I thought he was.

36:34.870 --> 36:38.200
- So, did Siri figure it out?

36:38.200 --> 36:41.530
- Let me actually consult
my favorite expert.

36:41.530 --> 36:44.200
Siri, did we fool them?

36:44.200 --> 36:47.370
F-O-O-L.

36:47.370 --> 36:48.470
Fool.

36:48.470 --> 36:50.130
And Siri says...

36:54.030 --> 36:56.700
- Adam Cheyer!

37:01.570 --> 37:04.270
Coming up, we serve
our main course of magic.

37:04.270 --> 37:06.670
Penn and Teller
perform after the break.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.700
- If there's one thing
Penn and Teller

37:19.700 --> 37:22.570
love more than magic,
it's good cooperage.

37:22.570 --> 37:24.670
While you all
google that word,

37:24.670 --> 37:26.930
let's bring out
Penn and Teller!

37:31.700 --> 37:33.270
- Ooh!

37:33.270 --> 37:35.400
What's this?

37:35.400 --> 37:40.300
We're all staring at a barrel
with things going through it.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.430
One thing I'll say
for Penn and Teller,

37:42.430 --> 37:45.130
they have their finger
on the pulse

37:45.130 --> 37:47.700
of the TV-watching public.

37:47.700 --> 37:51.070
'Cause when we're watching TV,
we demand to see

37:51.070 --> 37:53.400
good cooperage.

37:53.400 --> 37:57.000
And there is some fine barrel
building up on that stage.

37:57.000 --> 38:01.400
Nice bilge.
Good staves.

38:01.400 --> 38:04.800
It's such a peaceful act.

38:04.800 --> 38:08.030
Ooh!
A new character enters.

38:08.030 --> 38:09.970
Who is it?

38:09.970 --> 38:12.970
A target with a balloon,

38:12.970 --> 38:15.270
meets a barrel with things.

38:16.930 --> 38:18.430
Now there's drama.

38:19.670 --> 38:22.030
Suspense.

38:22.030 --> 38:24.570
Conflict.

38:24.570 --> 38:26.030
Action.

38:26.030 --> 38:30.030
The barrel makes its move.

38:30.030 --> 38:31.530
Ha ha!

38:31.530 --> 38:34.130
And the barrel is victorious.

38:34.130 --> 38:38.530
And the target, balloon-less,
skulks off, defeated.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.130
So how are they doing this?

38:41.130 --> 38:43.030
There's no one in the barrel,
not with those things

38:43.030 --> 38:44.400
going through it.

38:44.400 --> 38:47.100
No one behind it.
No one underneath it.

38:47.100 --> 38:49.800
Can't be mechanical
with that bad marksmanship.

38:49.800 --> 38:52.170
So it must be...

38:53.470 --> 38:55.400
a monkey!

38:55.400 --> 38:57.730
There's a monkey in the barrel.

38:57.730 --> 39:01.200
Something very simian
about that barrel.

39:01.200 --> 39:04.330
People love animals
in magic acts.

39:04.330 --> 39:07.200
As long as they're treated
with compassion, dignity,

39:07.200 --> 39:09.130
and respect.
Ooh.

39:09.130 --> 39:10.400
What's happening now?

39:10.400 --> 39:12.030
What's the monkey doing?

39:12.030 --> 39:14.730
Those things do
go all the way through.

39:14.730 --> 39:16.100
Oh.

39:16.100 --> 39:18.570
Now it's a musical piece.

39:18.570 --> 39:20.500
Very free jazz.

39:20.500 --> 39:22.470
Very avant-garde.

39:22.470 --> 39:26.470
Very 21st century classical.

39:26.470 --> 39:28.470
Oh, I get it.

39:28.470 --> 39:32.070
But it's not a monkey.

39:36.070 --> 39:38.170
The big son of a bitch
was in the barrel.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.800
- Ah.
- Wah!

39:43.800 --> 39:45.870
- Oh my goodness.

39:45.870 --> 39:47.470
Wow.

39:48.670 --> 39:51.070
- Penn, that was a great trick.

39:51.070 --> 39:53.170
- No, no, no, no, no.
No, Alyson.

39:53.170 --> 39:55.330
No, no.
That was a good trick.

39:55.330 --> 39:57.000
I'm uh, um...

39:57.000 --> 39:59.970
6 foot 7 inches tall,
weigh 236 pounds.

39:59.970 --> 40:02.530
That's a small barrel,
that is a good trick.

40:02.530 --> 40:04.170
But it's not a great trick.

40:04.170 --> 40:06.000
If that were a great trick,

40:06.000 --> 40:07.830
I would have been
comfortable in the barrel.

40:07.830 --> 40:10.430
- Aw.

40:10.430 --> 40:14.270
We gotta wrap it up.
Good night from "Fool Us."

40:14.270 --> 40:16.670
- Gotta get to that
breakfast buffet.

40:16.670 --> 40:18.670
The lines are long.
