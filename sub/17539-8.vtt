Mirror, mirror,

00:17.351 --> 00:19.353
So, I seriously have to
take a class

00:19.353 --> 00:21.146
called "Remedial Goodness"?

00:21.146 --> 00:25.317
‐Yep. There's a
two hour exam about smiling.
‐No.

00:25.317 --> 00:27.819
Smiling's super important
in Auradon.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.029
Let's see what you got.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.449
Try less teeth.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.201
Evie: Better,

00:34.201 --> 00:36.787
but your eyes
still look villiany.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.413
Try smizing.

00:38.413 --> 00:41.333
‐Smizing?
‐It's smiling with your eyes.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.876
Apparently it's a thing
that good people do.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.254
Ooh, smells like
lunch is ready.

00:45.254 --> 00:47.714
It's no crusty,
barley oatmeal

00:47.714 --> 00:50.801
like the goblins use to make
at the slop shop back home.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.219
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.179
Oh, that's Ruby,
Rapunzel's daughter.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.598
Her hair leaves
ten minutes after she does.

00:56.598 --> 00:59.101
That girl has got to do
something about those
split ends.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.688
Ouch!

01:04.147 --> 01:06.483
Well, what are you
waiting for? Dive in.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.194
What is all this
frou‐frou stuff?

01:09.194 --> 01:12.489
I don't want any
glazed this or sprinkled that.

01:12.489 --> 01:13.615
(sniffs)

01:13.615 --> 01:16.952
Okay, give me some of
that puffed deliciousness.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.662
(mumbles)
It's so good!

01:18.662 --> 01:20.414
Sorry? Oh, yeah,

01:20.414 --> 01:22.624
I can't hear you over
the puffed deliciousness.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.085
Mmm, I wish I had
more mouths.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.420
Hey, friendly
word of advice:

01:26.420 --> 01:28.422
It's not cool
to steal in Auradon.

01:28.422 --> 01:31.049
I know.
It's weird, right?

01:31.049 --> 01:34.678
I mean, why put it out
if you don't want it stolen?

01:34.678 --> 01:36.263
Exactly.

01:36.263 --> 01:39.016
Ooh, is that
cranberry sauce?

01:41.018 --> 01:42.894
A fountain
made of chocolate?

01:43.895 --> 01:46.148
Fruit shaped like
little animals?

01:46.148 --> 01:48.608
Oh, I could get used
to this place.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.235
So yummy!

01:50.235 --> 01:53.071
Mmm (chuckles)

01:53.071 --> 01:54.323
(gasp)

01:56.825 --> 01:58.327
Get your own
buffet table.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.162
(scoffs)

02:03.373 --> 02:05.500
Were we that bad
when we first got here?

02:05.500 --> 02:10.630
Oh, no. We were
the picture of elegance.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.383
