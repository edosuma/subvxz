WEBVTT

00:56.813 --> 00:59.016
All units, all units,
this is Sierra Whisky 45.

00:59.049 --> 01:00.850
Stand by unless urgent.

01:00.883 --> 01:04.054
Any patrols able to assist with
backup at Kenning Farm.

01:04.087 --> 01:05.788
Attempted to clear private
property,

01:05.822 --> 01:07.091
experiencing resistance.

01:07.124 --> 01:09.625
Repeat, requesting backup at
Kenning Farm, over.

01:15.032 --> 01:16.133
Get up!

01:16.166 --> 01:17.167
Get up!

01:17.201 --> 01:19.569
Move.

01:19.602 --> 01:20.903
Move!

01:20.938 --> 01:21.838
Get up.

01:21.871 --> 01:22.739
Get up.

01:25.342 --> 01:26.276
Move.

01:26.310 --> 01:27.177
Move.

01:32.950 --> 01:34.084
You, get them out of here.

01:34.118 --> 01:35.319
You, get them cuffed.

01:35.352 --> 01:36.420
We need another unit.

01:36.453 --> 01:40.523
Sergeant Lawson to control,
we need more units.

02:53.430 --> 02:55.232
Hands up!

02:56.400 --> 02:58.202
It wasn't me.

02:58.235 --> 02:59.303
It wasn't me.

03:00.903 --> 03:02.973
Something in the shadows.

04:34.965 --> 04:37.000
Well, this looks
straightforward enough.

04:37.034 --> 04:37.900
Yeah.

04:37.935 --> 04:39.937
Bust down the door, kick out
squatters,

04:39.970 --> 04:41.871
secure the property.

04:41.904 --> 04:43.739
Life of a bailiff.

04:43.773 --> 04:46.076
Anything is better than last
gig, huh?

04:46.109 --> 04:49.479
After facing armed insurgents
with suicide vests, yeah.

04:49.513 --> 04:52.015
Now we get to scare pothead
teenagers.

04:52.049 --> 04:53.383
Easy life.

04:53.417 --> 04:54.451
We earned it, soldier.

04:54.484 --> 04:55.352
Come on.

05:06.496 --> 05:10.067
So, as agreed, first case.

05:13.237 --> 05:15.405
If happy, let's make this a
regular agreement.

05:15.439 --> 05:17.241
There's plenty more where that
came from.

05:17.274 --> 05:19.376
You can guarantee me how many
kilos?

05:19.409 --> 05:20.843
Unlimited.

05:20.876 --> 05:22.446
My boys down the docks have got
final sign off

05:22.479 --> 05:23.380
on the containers.

05:33.423 --> 05:34.291
We good?

05:37.227 --> 05:38.262
We very good.

05:41.598 --> 05:43.567
This is private property.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.203
This is your eviction notice,
lads.

05:46.236 --> 05:47.837
You called the police?

05:47.870 --> 05:49.339
No, did you?

05:49.373 --> 05:51.475
We're not police, we're
bailiffs.

05:53.277 --> 05:54.578
You told me this place is
clean.

05:54.611 --> 05:55.845
Usually is.

06:00.916 --> 06:01.952
I've got an idea.

06:02.619 --> 06:04.421
Why don't you just turn around

06:04.454 --> 06:06.990
and pretend none of this ever
happened.

06:07.024 --> 06:10.060
Sorry lads, we can't let you
do that.

06:10.093 --> 06:13.163
Then, you leave us no choice.

07:34.277 --> 07:35.112
Caitlin.

07:35.145 --> 07:35.979
Caitlin.

07:36.012 --> 07:37.647
Caitlin, stop.

07:37.681 --> 07:38.548
Stop.

08:47.317 --> 08:48.351
Hey.

08:48.385 --> 08:50.587
Sorry, the door was open.

08:51.621 --> 08:53.256
Latte?

08:53.290 --> 08:54.157
Thanks.

09:00.464 --> 09:02.432
I'm worried about you.

09:02.466 --> 09:04.067
Don't be.

09:04.100 --> 09:05.335
Come on, Caitlin.

09:05.368 --> 09:06.269
Don't give me that tough soldier
act.

09:06.303 --> 09:08.038
I saw you yesterday.

09:08.071 --> 09:10.006
It all still bothers you,
doesn't it?

09:11.174 --> 09:12.542
What is it you want me to
say?

09:13.210 --> 09:15.111
Look, you've always had my
back.

09:15.145 --> 09:16.480
I'm just saying I got yours.

09:19.082 --> 09:21.685
This thing is gonna follow me
wherever I go.

09:21.718 --> 09:24.154
Running away isn't gonna help.

09:24.187 --> 09:25.355
True.

09:25.388 --> 09:27.457
Problem is, Caitlin in this job,
we're literally everyday...

09:27.491 --> 09:29.259
Yeah, and that's the life we
know.

09:30.227 --> 09:31.094
Caitlin.

09:32.796 --> 09:35.398
Look, knowing you've got my
back

09:35.432 --> 09:36.566
is all I need right now.

09:40.837 --> 09:43.640
Go on, go and get your gear
on.

10:01.391 --> 10:03.460
Here we are look, couple of
bad asses.

10:03.493 --> 10:06.162
Yeah, the police said you
guys pulverized those assholes.

10:06.196 --> 10:08.365
Yeah, yeah, leave it out
lads.

10:08.398 --> 10:09.199
No chance.

10:09.232 --> 10:10.534
So let me get this straight you
two.

10:10.567 --> 10:12.369
You stumble across a drug den,

10:12.402 --> 10:13.637
and instead of calling the
police,

10:13.670 --> 10:15.405
you take out the thugs
yourselves?

10:15.438 --> 10:16.506
Now that's mad shit.

10:16.540 --> 10:18.775
Nothing to be proud of.

10:18.808 --> 10:20.210
Like the fuck it isn't.

10:22.612 --> 10:24.147
Boss wants to see you two.

10:25.248 --> 10:26.116
Now.

10:32.489 --> 10:33.523
Thank you, Rebecca.

10:37.527 --> 10:40.330
So, traditionally we let the
police handle

10:40.363 --> 10:43.466
any violent or illegal
situations.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.834
Well, it's not like we had a
choice.

10:44.868 --> 10:45.970
It was self defense.

10:46.003 --> 10:48.471
They attacked us and we took
care of the situation.

10:49.272 --> 10:52.242
So, I guess I'm lucky that
you two are ex-Army.

10:52.275 --> 10:55.111
Otherwise I'd be looking for two
new bailiffs.

10:55.145 --> 10:56.346
Sorry.

10:56.379 --> 10:57.714
Look, it won't happen again.

10:59.883 --> 11:02.686
Another job for you two, if
you're up for it.

11:02.719 --> 11:04.254
- Not really.
- Absolutely.

11:05.255 --> 11:08.458
Don't worry, this one will be
far less exciting.

11:08.491 --> 11:11.695
Some local brat has inherited
his father's old farm.

11:13.530 --> 11:15.165
What are we evicting, sheep?

11:15.198 --> 11:17.267
No livestock, just vagrants.

11:17.300 --> 11:18.435
Vagrants?

11:18.468 --> 11:20.370
Yes, the previous owner

11:20.403 --> 11:22.339
allowed the homeless onto his
land.

11:22.372 --> 11:25.141
The new owner is only interested
in selling the property.

11:25.175 --> 11:27.377
So it needs to be cleared as
soon as possible.

11:27.410 --> 11:28.511
Great.

11:28.545 --> 11:30.914
So, we're kicking out homeless
people from their homes.

11:30.948 --> 11:31.983
Nice job.

11:32.016 --> 11:33.817
No, the police already
cleared the property.

11:33.850 --> 11:37.253
You're going in to clean up and
secure the old farmhouse.

11:37.287 --> 11:38.755
Okay, sounds simple.

11:38.788 --> 11:41.291
Definitely more simple than
the last job.

11:41.324 --> 11:42.559
Well, there's something.

11:42.592 --> 11:45.328
Well, Rebecca will explain
the rest of the details to you.

11:51.301 --> 11:52.535
Hey Boss, be honest with
me.

11:52.569 --> 11:54.437
How many bad guys did you kill
in The Army?

11:54.471 --> 11:55.572
Shut up Ol.

11:55.605 --> 11:57.273
Caitlin totally killed
way more than Brad did.

11:57.307 --> 11:58.075
Oh yeah, I got it.

11:58.109 --> 11:59.476
She's a lean mean killing
machine

11:59.509 --> 12:01.578
Oliver, enough.

12:01.611 --> 12:04.180
Why on earth did we have to
bring this two, Caitlin?

12:04.214 --> 12:04.848
Okay, we're nearly
there.

12:04.881 --> 12:05.749
Straight ahead.

12:27.938 --> 12:28.805
Morning everyone.

12:28.838 --> 12:29.906
Morning, Rebecca.

12:29.940 --> 12:31.408
So, what's the plan?

12:31.441 --> 12:32.542
Hey, well, first things
first.

12:32.575 --> 12:34.210
Jameson sent us over three extra
hands

12:34.244 --> 12:35.545
to help us out on this one.

12:35.578 --> 12:36.513
Is there a problem?

12:36.546 --> 12:37.681
I thought this was a straight
enough job.

12:37.714 --> 12:38.782
Didn't she tell you?

12:39.582 --> 12:41.551
Our client is coming to watch
over things today.

12:41.584 --> 12:42.919
Watch over things?

12:42.953 --> 12:43.753
Nice.

12:43.787 --> 12:45.488
He just wants to sell the
land.

12:45.522 --> 12:46.556
Yeah, sounds good to me.

12:46.589 --> 12:47.457
It's fresh meat.

12:48.591 --> 12:50.460
But, no work for us.

12:50.493 --> 12:52.629
A good manager always delegates.

12:52.662 --> 12:53.897
Great, maybe you two can go

12:53.931 --> 12:55.398
and pester somebody else today.

12:55.432 --> 12:56.299
Guys!

12:57.600 --> 12:58.735
Hey guys.

12:58.768 --> 12:59.869
Welcome to the team.

12:59.903 --> 13:01.438
- Caitlin.
- Tony.

13:01.471 --> 13:02.739
- Tony.
- Lawrence.

13:02.772 --> 13:03.606
Lawrence.

13:03.640 --> 13:04.674
- Jen.
- Jen.

13:04.708 --> 13:06.242
If you guys have any questions,
just let me know.

13:06.276 --> 13:06.944
Thanks.

13:08.278 --> 13:09.446
So the homeless were living
here?

13:09.479 --> 13:10.547
Yeah.

13:10.580 --> 13:11.881
Pretty much the entire land.

13:12.615 --> 13:13.683
I'm amazed the council
allowed it.

13:13.717 --> 13:15.318
It's not very sanitary.

13:16.886 --> 13:18.788
To be honest with you,

13:18.822 --> 13:19.756
I don't think that they were
fully aware

13:19.789 --> 13:22.292
with just how many people were
living here.

13:23.493 --> 13:27.263
This land is pretty far off the
beaten path.

13:28.798 --> 13:30.500
Now it's down to the new owner.

13:30.533 --> 13:31.768
Leave us alone.

13:31.801 --> 13:33.303
Leave us alone.

13:33.336 --> 13:35.371
- Leave us alone.
- Fucking protesters.

13:35.405 --> 13:37.874
Go fucking protest on someone
else's land.

13:37.907 --> 13:40.910
Fuckin' do-gooders, mind their
own fuckin' business.

13:42.378 --> 13:43.780
Hi Mr. Kenning, I'm Rebecca.

13:44.581 --> 13:47.383
Everyone, this is Mr. Richard
Kenning.

13:47.417 --> 13:49.719
He recently inherited this land
off his father.

13:49.753 --> 13:50.820
Sorry for your loss.

13:50.854 --> 13:52.555
Don't be, dad was a prick.

13:52.589 --> 13:54.557
The sooner that I can offload
this shit hole

13:54.591 --> 13:56.559
and make some money, the better.

13:56.593 --> 13:58.628
You won't be following in
your father's footsteps?

13:58.661 --> 14:00.697
I'll help the homeless, when
I'm no longer in need

14:00.730 --> 14:02.967
of help myself, thank you very
much.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.902
Mr. Kenning, we're here to
help you clear the property.

14:05.936 --> 14:08.005
Council won't let me sell it
until I do.

14:09.806 --> 14:12.408
This is Caitlin and Brad,
they're our top team.

14:12.442 --> 14:14.310
And I'm here if you have any
questions.

14:14.344 --> 14:15.012
Why are the pigs here?

14:15.045 --> 14:16.981
It's just standard procedure.

14:17.014 --> 14:19.083
It speeds things up
paperwork-wise.

14:19.116 --> 14:20.450
Fine.

14:20.483 --> 14:22.485
So, you're in charge then?

14:22.519 --> 14:23.988
What now?

14:24.021 --> 14:26.023
I'm paying a fortune for you
lot.

14:26.056 --> 14:28.324
So, our signage team will
make a start at the entrance,

14:28.358 --> 14:30.027
and then we'll just work our way
through the house.

14:30.060 --> 14:32.896
Michael, if you wanna take Tony
and Jen,

14:32.930 --> 14:34.564
start at the front of the
property with signs,

14:34.597 --> 14:36.967
make sure all the entrances are
secure.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.635
Don't engage with the
protesters.

14:38.668 --> 14:40.403
All right, come on, signage
team.

14:40.436 --> 14:43.373
One of you get the toolbox,
other get the posts, follow me.

14:44.607 --> 14:47.011
Ollie, do you wanna take
Lawrence?

14:47.044 --> 14:48.578
Start unloading the van.

14:48.611 --> 14:49.879
Quick as you can, Ol.

14:49.913 --> 14:51.447
Yes sir.

14:51.481 --> 14:53.017
Let's make a start in the
house.

14:54.118 --> 14:54.985
What a dick!

14:59.123 --> 15:00.490
Great.

15:00.523 --> 15:01.959
What a shit hole.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.428
We'll try and make this as
quick as possible.

15:05.461 --> 15:06.263
Thanks.

15:06.297 --> 15:07.597
We'll be glad to get out of
here.

15:07.630 --> 15:09.599
Especially with him around.

15:09.632 --> 15:11.068
What, Mr. Kenning?

15:11.101 --> 15:12.468
Why, do you know him?

15:12.502 --> 15:14.537
Yeah, he's very well known to
us.

15:14.571 --> 15:16.372
A bit of a spiky character.

15:16.406 --> 15:17.507
Fabulous.

15:17.540 --> 15:19.076
There's always something, isn't
there?

15:23.479 --> 15:25.115
I can't believe this is where
Lawson died.

15:25.149 --> 15:27.417
Be glad to get out of here as
soon as possible.

15:27.450 --> 15:28.751
Why, what's up?

15:28.785 --> 15:29.853
It's DI Evans.

15:29.886 --> 15:32.455
He wants me to wrap up these
missing people reports.

15:32.488 --> 15:33.356
Sounds fun.

15:36.626 --> 15:37.493
Cozy.

15:38.295 --> 15:40.630
Yeah, the glamorous life of
the bailiff.

15:41.966 --> 15:43.867
They delivered your boards
earlier.

15:43.900 --> 15:44.567
Great.

15:44.601 --> 15:46.636
So how many rooms do we have?

15:46.669 --> 15:48.105
Six, I think.

15:48.138 --> 15:50.874
Okay guys, looks like we need
safety gear for this one.

15:50.907 --> 15:52.042
Safety gear?

15:52.076 --> 15:55.179
Yeah, this place likely has
broken glass everywhere.

15:55.212 --> 15:56.613
Well, I don't always agree
with you

15:56.646 --> 15:58.481
but this time you're right,
Oliver.

15:58.514 --> 16:00.483
Everybody tread carefully.

16:00.516 --> 16:01.384
Told you.

16:04.888 --> 16:07.657
It's probably safer if we
stay outside.

16:07.690 --> 16:08.758
This is my house.

16:09.626 --> 16:10.493
Of course.

16:18.768 --> 16:20.770
Don't I know you from
somewhere?

16:20.803 --> 16:21.905
Possibly sir.

16:21.939 --> 16:24.208
Brad, if you could take PC
Williams and Lawrence,

16:24.241 --> 16:26.076
do a recce down here, make sure
there's no squatters

16:26.110 --> 16:27.744
or anything we need to deal
with.

16:28.845 --> 16:30.080
Just me and you.

16:30.114 --> 16:30.981
Great!

16:32.016 --> 16:33.516
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:33.549 --> 16:34.717
You love me really, bro.

16:36.220 --> 16:38.688
Bro, really, I don't.

16:39.555 --> 16:41.926
Ollie, if you PC Gray and I
take upstairs?

16:55.239 --> 16:56.606
It looks clear so far.

16:58.042 --> 17:00.743
He must have had one massive
porn collection.

17:52.662 --> 17:53.663
Oh, sorry.

17:57.067 --> 17:57.935
Sorry.

17:58.768 --> 18:01.537
Just saying, looks like we're
good, right?

18:02.605 --> 18:03.873
I'm sure I saw something.

18:07.177 --> 18:08.078
Everything okay?

18:08.845 --> 18:11.614
Ol, how are we doing up
there?

18:11.647 --> 18:13.050
Yeah, yeah, we're all clear.

18:36.672 --> 18:37.840
Hurry up, Ollie.

19:05.768 --> 19:06.636
Come on, dad.

19:07.870 --> 19:08.738
Give me a sign.

19:09.806 --> 19:10.773
Investments,

19:11.841 --> 19:13.077
offshore savings,

19:14.144 --> 19:15.012
anything.

19:16.313 --> 19:17.914
Do you miss your old man?

19:20.217 --> 19:23.053
I told ya, dad was a prick.

19:24.787 --> 19:26.924
He never let anyone come here.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.624
Said his work was too important.

19:29.592 --> 19:32.762
Maybe helping the homeless
really meant something to him.

19:34.998 --> 19:36.233
You didn't know him.

19:36.266 --> 19:37.800
He didn't care about anyone.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.337
He didn't care when mom died.

19:41.771 --> 19:43.773
He kicked me out the house when
I was 16.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.877
I literally never saw him again.

19:47.910 --> 19:48.778
Prick!

19:50.913 --> 19:51.781
Right.

19:55.986 --> 19:56.853
I'm done here.

19:59.957 --> 20:00.823
Come on, dad.

20:02.059 --> 20:03.726
What was so fucking important?

20:05.728 --> 20:07.998
Look, Mr. Kenning.

20:10.234 --> 20:13.170
My dad wasn't a good one, he
left when I was young,

20:13.203 --> 20:15.205
and that forced me into The Army
as a teenager.

20:15.239 --> 20:17.341
It was the best thing that ever
happened to me.

20:17.374 --> 20:20.410
What I'm saying is, maybe we
don't need our dads,

20:20.444 --> 20:23.447
or maybe your dad loved you in
his own special way.

20:23.480 --> 20:24.348
Loved me?

20:25.415 --> 20:27.184
He once beat me unconscious,

20:27.217 --> 20:29.219
'cause I spoke before being
spoken to.

20:31.088 --> 20:32.289
Fine.

20:32.322 --> 20:33.924
So maybe your dad was a prick.

20:35.259 --> 20:36.093
All right, I'm done here.

20:36.126 --> 20:37.327
I'll meet you downstairs.

21:59.443 --> 22:01.111
Us black guys hate the cold.

22:03.213 --> 22:05.915
Next time, that fucking Ollie is
getting outdoor duties.

22:05.949 --> 22:07.351
So, are we nearly done then?

22:07.384 --> 22:08.952
Yeah.

22:08.986 --> 22:10.153
I can't feel my fingers.

22:13.357 --> 22:15.926
Looks like we got one more
entrance to mark.

22:15.959 --> 22:17.194
Tell you what, a tea break,
yeah?

22:17.227 --> 22:18.228
Oh, you read my mind.

22:18.262 --> 22:19.129
Nice one.

22:27.537 --> 22:29.973
It's still warm...

22:34.378 --> 22:35.245
Guys.

22:37.114 --> 22:40.217
Just stop fucking about, this
ain't funny.

22:40.250 --> 22:42.085
It's scary enough out here as it
is.

22:45.455 --> 22:47.291
Oh, guys, look guys, I...

22:51.428 --> 22:52.562
What the fuck?

22:58.168 --> 22:59.036
Shit!

23:08.045 --> 23:09.112
Okay guys, we're set
upstairs,

23:09.146 --> 23:10.047
how are we doing down here?

23:10.080 --> 23:12.115
Yeah, I think we're just
about done.

23:12.149 --> 23:13.517
Yep, we're happy.

23:13.550 --> 23:14.384
Thank God.

23:14.418 --> 23:16.053
Sick of this place, it's a shit
hole.

23:16.086 --> 23:16.919
Great.

23:19.022 --> 23:21.591
Where's Kenning?

23:21.625 --> 23:22.926
Mr. Kenning.

23:28.231 --> 23:29.333
Are you ready?

23:29.366 --> 23:30.233
Just about.

23:32.402 --> 23:34.870
Michael, Tony!

23:34.904 --> 23:36.306
What's wrong?

23:36.340 --> 23:37.574
I found Michael's phone.

23:38.575 --> 23:40.110
He's just gone.

23:40.143 --> 23:41.645
He's just gone, he's just
disappeared.

23:41.678 --> 23:42.346
Vanished?

23:42.379 --> 23:44.914
Playing silly buggers more like.

23:49.486 --> 23:50.354
Michael!

23:51.254 --> 23:52.888
Michael!

23:52.923 --> 23:54.391
Enough boys.

23:54.424 --> 23:56.159
You've really scared this girl.

23:56.193 --> 23:58.595
It's not like Michael to do
something like this.

23:59.596 --> 24:03.400
Well then Ollie, you're no
longer my least favorite.

24:03.433 --> 24:05.602
Yeah, even I'll admit this
isn't funny.

24:05.635 --> 24:06.603
Enough of this.

24:06.636 --> 24:08.638
Ollie, help me get the boards
off the window.

24:30.293 --> 24:34.498
Right, I need a light down here
and a medipack now.

24:39.469 --> 24:41.638
Just breathe, Ollie.

24:41.671 --> 24:43.473
Deep breaths.

24:43.507 --> 24:44.541
Deep breaths.

24:50.747 --> 24:51.948
Deep breaths, Ollie.

24:55.685 --> 24:56.586
It's Michael.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.288
And what the hell has
happened to Tony?

24:58.321 --> 24:59.990
It's the fuckin' man that
killed Michael.

25:00.023 --> 25:02.092
Shut up Ol, it's obviously
more than one person.

25:02.125 --> 25:03.360
Sit up, sit up.

25:03.393 --> 25:07.030
This Officer 2472, do you
copy?

25:07.063 --> 25:08.999
1907 calling in.

25:10.200 --> 25:11.201
Nothing.

25:11.234 --> 25:12.102
Nothing.

25:13.103 --> 25:14.337
I had signal before.

25:14.371 --> 25:15.038
There's something blocking
us.

25:15.071 --> 25:16.440
The body came from upstairs.

25:16.473 --> 25:17.507
Gray.

25:17.541 --> 25:18.208
Yeah.

25:18.241 --> 25:21.044
Everyone else, just stay here.

25:21.077 --> 25:23.013
This is fucking insane.

25:23.046 --> 25:24.414
Come on you, up on your feet.

25:24.448 --> 25:25.415
Rebecca, help me.

25:26.416 --> 25:27.584
Rebecca!

25:27.617 --> 25:30.053
I'm gonna see about getting
some lights working here.

25:30.086 --> 25:33.123
Jen, Lawrence, grab a torch.

25:33.156 --> 25:34.458
I need you to help me, okay?

25:37.594 --> 25:38.462
Come this way.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.520
This is the police.

26:03.553 --> 26:07.057
Put your weapons down, come out
with your hands up.

26:09.793 --> 26:10.794
Stop, police.

26:26.076 --> 26:27.077
Where'd he go?

26:29.346 --> 26:30.213
No idea.

26:40.824 --> 26:42.225
Oh, found it.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.237
I think I've got a signal.

26:59.743 --> 27:00.610
Guys.

27:05.549 --> 27:07.217
Are you okay?

27:07.250 --> 27:09.419
The floor, it just went out
from under us.

27:11.588 --> 27:13.156
Jen doesn't look too good.

27:13.189 --> 27:14.524
I'm gonna get down to you.

27:16.626 --> 27:17.694
What the fuck?

27:19.663 --> 27:20.864
This house is falling apart.

27:20.897 --> 27:23.333
Jen and Lawrence are down there,
I need to get down to them.

27:23.366 --> 27:24.301
No way.

27:24.334 --> 27:25.535
There's no guarantees we can get
you back up.

27:25.569 --> 27:27.203
Jen needs medical assistance.

27:28.305 --> 27:29.639
We found someone upstairs.

27:29.673 --> 27:32.409
- I knew it.
- We lost him.

27:32.442 --> 27:33.610
There's a hidden doorway.

27:33.643 --> 27:34.611
Leading where?

27:34.644 --> 27:36.446
We don't know, all we could
see was steps

27:36.479 --> 27:37.647
leading down into darkness.

27:37.681 --> 27:40.584
But it's probably our best
chance of getting out of here.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.352
It looks like we're in a
tunnel.

27:43.486 --> 27:45.555
I can see some light in the
distance.

27:45.589 --> 27:46.823
We need to split up.

27:46.856 --> 27:48.625
Caitlin, no, that's crazy.

27:48.658 --> 27:50.760
Potentially, there's two ways
of getting out of here.

27:50.794 --> 27:53.096
This tunnel or their secret
doorway.

27:54.065 --> 27:55.799
Let's increase our chances of
getting out of here,

27:55.832 --> 27:58.401
and getting help by splitting.

27:58.435 --> 27:59.302
She's right.

28:00.370 --> 28:01.571
We divide by skill set.

28:02.472 --> 28:05.775
PC Gray, come with me, PC
Williams, stay with Brad.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.744
I hope you're right about
this.

28:07.777 --> 28:08.712
Trust me.

28:31.969 --> 28:33.703
Go and find the others.

28:33.737 --> 28:35.505
We need to get out of here.

28:35.538 --> 28:36.406
Good luck.

28:44.581 --> 28:45.415
How is she?

28:45.448 --> 28:47.617
Not good, she's barely
breathing.

28:47.651 --> 28:48.852
There's some reaction to
stimulus,

28:48.885 --> 28:50.453
but she's mostly out of it.

28:50.487 --> 28:52.355
Looks like broken bones.

28:52.389 --> 28:53.790
Possibly internal bleeding.

28:53.823 --> 28:54.724
What can we do?

28:56.226 --> 28:57.627
We have to leave her?

28:57.661 --> 28:59.262
Alone?

28:59.295 --> 29:00.830
I'll stay with her.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.532
Are you sure?

29:04.300 --> 29:05.168
Yep.

29:06.536 --> 29:08.905
Pretty sure I'm happy not
finding out what that is.

29:08.939 --> 29:10.907
Just don't do anything to
bring attention to you and Jen.

29:10.941 --> 29:13.810
Keep your torch off and stay
quiet, do you understand?

29:13.843 --> 29:15.612
If she starts to show signs
of consciousness,

29:15.645 --> 29:16.780
just talk to her.

29:16.813 --> 29:19.482
Try to keep her calm but keep
her awake.

29:19.516 --> 29:20.483
Okay.

29:20.517 --> 29:21.785
Let's keep her comfy.

29:21.818 --> 29:22.686
Yeah.

29:42.372 --> 29:43.007
Ready?

29:43.040 --> 29:43.907
Yeah.

29:47.744 --> 29:48.979
I've got a signal.

29:49.013 --> 29:51.448
I've got a signal.

29:51.481 --> 29:52.882
I've got a signal.

29:54.451 --> 29:55.318
My battery.

29:57.454 --> 29:58.956
But I had a signal.

29:58.989 --> 30:00.857
It must be this spot.

30:00.890 --> 30:01.926
No signal for me.

30:02.625 --> 30:04.894
But I had a signal, I
promise.

30:04.929 --> 30:05.996
Where's Jen's phone?

30:11.501 --> 30:13.503
Smashed, probably in the fall.

30:14.604 --> 30:17.407
Looks like mine is the only
one with any juice left.

30:17.440 --> 30:18.943
The reception is not gonna get
any better down there.

30:18.976 --> 30:22.378
Here, just check it periodically
for a signal.

30:22.412 --> 30:24.048
Don't waste the battery by
checking every five seconds.

30:24.081 --> 30:27.283
And if you do get a signal, just
call 999, nothing else.

30:27.317 --> 30:28.752
Do you understand?

30:46.971 --> 30:49.506
What kind of a house has a
secret staircase?

30:50.740 --> 30:52.609
A fucked up one.

30:52.642 --> 30:53.576
Thanks, Ollie.

30:54.477 --> 30:55.845
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

30:55.879 --> 30:57.081
It means, shut the fuck up,
Ollie.

30:57.114 --> 30:58.481
Fuck off.

30:58.515 --> 31:01.618
It's obviously illegal,
whatever it is.

31:01.651 --> 31:02.919
Why else make it secret?

31:04.487 --> 31:06.723
Sometimes pigs just need to
keep their noses

31:06.756 --> 31:08.458
out of other people's
businesses.

31:13.931 --> 31:14.798
It's a tunnel.

31:18.068 --> 31:20.403
I guess we have no choice but
to keep going.

31:22.605 --> 31:24.707
I guess.

31:33.984 --> 31:35.085
What the fuck was that?

31:35.119 --> 31:36.553
I don't like the sound of
that.

31:36.586 --> 31:37.554
What do you think it was?

31:37.587 --> 31:39.889
What, do you think it's what
killed Michael?

31:39.924 --> 31:42.092
I'm hoping that young lad is
still alive down there.

31:42.126 --> 31:42.759
What, Tony?

31:42.792 --> 31:44.360
For his sake, I hope not.

31:46.830 --> 31:49.899
What were you up to down
here, dad?

32:08.185 --> 32:09.586
Are these bones?

32:10.787 --> 32:11.788
Not just any bone.

32:13.157 --> 32:14.091
Human bone.

32:16.026 --> 32:16.893
Where are we?

32:18.095 --> 32:18.963
Hell!

32:35.511 --> 32:36.379
Shit.

32:37.881 --> 32:39.549
Well come on stairs, pick a
tunnel.

32:39.582 --> 32:40.683
There's literally two options.

32:40.717 --> 32:43.053
Well, which option would you
take?

32:43.087 --> 32:43.954
That one.

32:47.690 --> 32:48.691
Maybe that one.

32:49.927 --> 32:51.161
Let's just split up.

32:51.195 --> 32:54.731
Absolutely under no circumstances
are we splitting up.

32:55.632 --> 32:56.466
What's the matter?

32:56.499 --> 32:57.134
Are you scared?

32:57.167 --> 32:58.202
No, Mr. Kenning.

32:58.235 --> 33:00.104
It's because we stand a better
chance of survival

33:00.137 --> 33:01.604
if we stay as one unit.

33:02.705 --> 33:05.541
If you can't decide which
path we're gonna take,

33:05.575 --> 33:07.777
I think we need some proper
fucking leadership.

33:09.046 --> 33:10.080
You?

33:10.114 --> 33:11.115
What's the matter?

33:11.148 --> 33:12.649
Don't like a strong man?

33:12.682 --> 33:13.716
Knock it off Kenning.

33:13.750 --> 33:16.120
Well, I say we take the
right, who's with me?

33:19.957 --> 33:22.458
Left, definitely left.

33:22.492 --> 33:23.559
- Suits me.
- Yeah.

33:29.499 --> 33:30.167
Cowards.

33:34.804 --> 33:35.872
Brad, this thing is
fucking useless.

33:35.905 --> 33:37.573
I'm taking it off.

33:40.576 --> 33:41.778
Get that fucking jacket off.

33:41.811 --> 33:43.113
Giving us all away.

33:43.147 --> 33:46.183
You look like a fucking traffic
cone.

33:56.226 --> 33:57.627
Did you hear that?

33:57.660 --> 33:58.761
Yeah.

33:58.795 --> 33:59.762
What is it?

33:59.796 --> 34:00.797
Go.

34:34.197 --> 34:36.065
Where's she come from?

34:53.183 --> 34:54.717
Everybody be really careful.

34:54.751 --> 34:57.121
No loud noises, no sudden
movements.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.028
Let's push on.

35:10.067 --> 35:12.802
Take as long as you want,
pig.

35:30.054 --> 35:31.754
What was that?

35:31.788 --> 35:33.257
Williams.

35:33.290 --> 35:34.124
Where is he?

35:34.158 --> 35:35.591
Where the fuck did he go?

35:35.625 --> 35:36.692
I don't know.

35:36.726 --> 35:38.929
One minute he's here, next he's
not.

35:38.962 --> 35:41.198
Okay, there's something very
bad down there.

35:43.033 --> 35:46.003
Where the fuck, are you
seriously leaving us?

35:46.036 --> 35:47.004
Some leader.

35:47.037 --> 35:49.306
Oy, wouldn't you want him to
run after you

35:49.339 --> 35:51.008
if you were the one they took?

35:54.044 --> 35:55.279
I say we keep moving.

35:56.180 --> 35:57.081
We're sitting ducks here.

35:57.114 --> 35:58.915
Oh, shut up, Brad
wouldn't leave us.

36:06.023 --> 36:07.824
I think Rich is right on this
one.

36:07.857 --> 36:09.226
No, no, you were right
before.

36:09.259 --> 36:10.693
Brad wouldn't abandon us.

36:10.726 --> 36:11.661
Unless he's dead.

36:13.030 --> 36:15.399
First the pig, then the idiotic
hulk.

36:15.432 --> 36:17.101
Who's next?

36:17.134 --> 36:18.168
I'm not sitting around here,

36:18.202 --> 36:20.337
waiting to get took like that.

36:21.771 --> 36:22.705
I'm going.

36:22.738 --> 36:25.008
Well, I'd rather follow an
idiotic hulk

36:25.042 --> 36:26.276
than a spoiled prick..

36:30.080 --> 36:32.149
For fuck's sake.

36:32.182 --> 36:34.318
- Brad!
- Did you find Williams?

36:34.351 --> 36:35.219
No.

36:36.286 --> 36:37.887
But I did find something else.

36:39.356 --> 36:42.993
She must have been down here
for weeks, months even.

36:43.026 --> 36:45.628
Yeah, well, she looks very
healthy, considering.

36:46.863 --> 36:47.763
Are you okay?

36:48.465 --> 36:51.135
Someone must be looking after
her.

36:51.168 --> 36:52.802
Where's your mommy and daddy?

36:57.441 --> 37:00.177
I think she wants to show us.

37:06.984 --> 37:08.385
Why do I have a bad feeling
about this?

37:14.291 --> 37:15.359
Some sort of a lab.

37:19.729 --> 37:20.931
Was this your father's?

37:21.797 --> 37:24.067
Jeez, your dad was into some
weird shit.

38:10.180 --> 38:11.048
Guys!

38:13.317 --> 38:14.184
What is this?

38:15.452 --> 38:16.320
Give me that.

38:19.256 --> 38:21.959
If this belonged to me dad, it's
mine now.

38:21.992 --> 38:23.994
Just be careful Mr. Kenning,
okay?

38:24.027 --> 38:24.995
We don't know what any of this
stuff is.

38:25.028 --> 38:27.797
Anything good we find down
here is mine.

38:27.830 --> 38:29.099
Do you hear me?

38:29.132 --> 38:30.367
This is my property.

38:33.136 --> 38:34.004
Sh!

38:56.360 --> 38:57.793
Stay back.

38:57.827 --> 38:58.662
Stay back.

38:58.695 --> 38:59.529
Just punch her in the fucking
face.

38:59.563 --> 39:02.032
- Shut up, Kenning.
- Seriously.

39:02.065 --> 39:03.200
You're Dr. Kenning's son?

39:03.233 --> 39:05.369
Well, who the hell are you?

39:05.402 --> 39:06.970
My name is Maya.

39:07.004 --> 39:08.838
I worked with Dr. Kenning,

39:08.871 --> 39:11.174
and that vial is some of his
life's work.

39:12.309 --> 39:13.443
In other words, it's mine.

39:13.477 --> 39:16.079
Just keep your fucking hands off
it.

39:16.113 --> 39:16.947
What is it?

39:16.980 --> 39:18.015
It's hard to explain.

39:18.048 --> 39:18.949
Wait, wait, wait.

39:18.982 --> 39:20.984
You said you worked with
Kenning's old man.

39:21.018 --> 39:22.085
What's going on?

39:22.119 --> 39:23.186
Tell me why our group have been
killed.

39:23.220 --> 39:24.988
What is going on down here?

39:25.022 --> 39:26.590
Things are getting worse down
here.

39:28.458 --> 39:30.127
We need to go now.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.962
If any of you guys came down
here tracked,

39:31.995 --> 39:32.862
it's not safe anymore.

39:32.895 --> 39:34.864
We need to go now.

39:34.897 --> 39:36.500
- You know a way out of here?
- Yes.

39:39.069 --> 39:40.137
Come on let's go.

39:50.514 --> 39:53.417
Hello, we found your
daughter.

39:59.056 --> 40:00.324
Hello.

40:37.527 --> 40:38.995
Little bitch stabbed me.

40:40.030 --> 40:41.498
We need to stop the bleeding.

40:52.476 --> 40:54.177
What are these things?

40:57.414 --> 40:59.383
- I've no idea.
- Caitlin.

40:59.416 --> 41:00.650
Are we gonna survive this?

41:06.189 --> 41:07.190
How much further?

41:07.224 --> 41:08.658
There's a long way to go yet.

41:10.961 --> 41:12.162
Tell me about me dad.

41:12.195 --> 41:14.231
He dedicated his life to
develop a serum

41:14.264 --> 41:15.932
that creates better humans.

41:15.966 --> 41:17.100
Better humans?

41:17.134 --> 41:18.502
She means this.

41:18.535 --> 41:19.636
You're seriously not thinking

41:19.669 --> 41:21.138
about drinking that, are you?

41:21.171 --> 41:22.506
What's it to you?

41:22.539 --> 41:24.141
This is my dad's gift to me.

41:24.174 --> 41:25.142
Oh, his gift to you?

41:25.175 --> 41:26.676
I know he would've wanted
me to have it.

41:26.710 --> 41:28.712
Oh, I can understand that.

41:28.745 --> 41:29.413
Have only known you a couple of
hours,

41:29.446 --> 41:31.481
would gladly let you take it.

41:31.515 --> 41:32.549
Did the serum work?

41:32.582 --> 41:33.650
Oh yeah.

41:33.683 --> 41:35.285
Your father was a genius.

41:35.318 --> 41:37.454
He's destined for great things
but,

41:38.488 --> 41:40.524
one of his creations killed him.

41:40.557 --> 41:41.691
His creations?

41:46.396 --> 41:48.432
That's one of the creations?

41:48.465 --> 41:52.636
His experiments were
successful in unforeseen ways.

41:52.669 --> 41:54.171
That sounds very diplomatic.

41:54.204 --> 41:56.306
What exactly does this serum do?

41:56.339 --> 41:59.176
Heightened reactions,
heightened strength

41:59.209 --> 42:01.111
but low intelligence.

42:01.144 --> 42:02.612
Wait, where do they come
from?

42:02.646 --> 42:07.184
To perfect his serum, Mr.
Kenning needed test subjects.

42:17.527 --> 42:19.162
Hey, hey, hey, calm down.

42:19.196 --> 42:20.030
Why am I here?

42:20.063 --> 42:21.231
Why am I strapped in?

42:22.799 --> 42:24.034
Please don't do this.

42:25.535 --> 42:26.603
No!

42:26.636 --> 42:27.504
No!

42:33.310 --> 42:34.578
Test subjects?

42:38.815 --> 42:40.617
You mean the homeless?

42:40.650 --> 42:41.585
Of course.

42:41.618 --> 42:43.520
That's why he had all this scum
on his land.

42:43.553 --> 42:45.388
He was experimenting on them.

42:45.422 --> 42:46.723
It's genius.

42:46.756 --> 42:49.292
Take worthless lives and make
them meaningful.

42:49.326 --> 42:50.560
Worthless to who?

42:51.528 --> 42:53.129
Everyone stop and be quiet.

42:55.499 --> 42:56.766
Everyone down.

43:06.776 --> 43:08.245
Where's Rebecca?

43:10.747 --> 43:12.315
She was here a minute ago.

43:12.349 --> 43:13.216
Rebecca.

43:14.150 --> 43:14.784
Brad.

43:14.818 --> 43:15.652
Brad.

43:15.685 --> 43:17.087
Sit down, Brad.

43:28.265 --> 43:29.132
Rebecca.

43:34.804 --> 43:35.639
Rebecca.

43:49.586 --> 43:51.521
Hey, get back.

43:51.555 --> 43:53.290
You fucking prick.

43:54.190 --> 43:58.128
Ollie, this is a big fucker,
give me help.

44:15.712 --> 44:17.213
Rebecca.

44:17.247 --> 44:18.114
Rebecca.

44:19.883 --> 44:20.850
Breathe, breathe.

44:20.884 --> 44:23.420
Ollie, I need something to stop
the bleeding.

44:25.455 --> 44:27.223
Rich.

44:27.257 --> 44:28.458
And that woman,

44:31.595 --> 44:33.129
don't trust them.

44:35.231 --> 44:36.733
They're evil.

44:36.766 --> 44:38.568
They're evil.

44:38.602 --> 44:42.472
We gotta get her somewhere,
safely, come on.

44:55.785 --> 44:56.653
Hello.

44:59.889 --> 45:00.824
Lawrence.

45:02.192 --> 45:04.794
Jeez, you scared the crap out
of me.

45:04.828 --> 45:05.829
What's going on?

45:05.862 --> 45:07.864
It's okay, don't worry.

45:07.897 --> 45:09.866
Caitlin and everyone will be
back soon.

45:10.968 --> 45:12.402
Back?

45:12.435 --> 45:14.871
From where?

45:14.904 --> 45:15.872
Where am I?

45:17.607 --> 45:18.475
We fell down.

45:20.710 --> 45:21.778
Where am I?

45:22.612 --> 45:24.714
We were in the basement and
we fell through the floor,

45:24.748 --> 45:26.616
into this tunnel underground.

45:27.283 --> 45:28.718
Caitlin and Officer Gray have
gone on

45:28.752 --> 45:30.153
to try and get some help.

45:34.224 --> 45:35.225
How are you feeling?

45:36.593 --> 45:38.662
My legs, I can't feel 'em.

45:42.899 --> 45:44.401
They'll be back with some
help soon.

45:49.305 --> 45:52.375
You can hold my hand if
you're scared.

45:52.409 --> 45:54.411
I'm not scared.

45:57.714 --> 46:00.483
What was that?

46:01.384 --> 46:02.252
I have no idea.

46:03.687 --> 46:04.854
Lawrence.

46:04.888 --> 46:05.755
Yeah.

46:06.991 --> 46:09.526
Don't let go of my hand.

46:09.559 --> 46:10.694
Yeah, yeah, okay.

46:12.029 --> 46:14.798
Promise me.

46:14.831 --> 46:16.833
Yeah, yeah, I promise.

46:23.339 --> 46:24.207
Hey, hey.

46:26.910 --> 46:28.878
Did you see how fast that thing
was?

46:28.912 --> 46:30.747
We didn't even see it coming.

46:30.780 --> 46:32.282
Yeah.

46:32.315 --> 46:33.650
Your father's serum at work.

46:37.487 --> 46:38.855
Amazing.

46:38.888 --> 46:40.657
You're very lucky to have
that.

46:40.690 --> 46:41.658
It's very rare.

46:42.792 --> 46:43.994
Will it make me faster?

46:45.528 --> 46:46.396
Faster.

46:47.497 --> 46:48.431
Stronger.

46:50.900 --> 46:51.768
Smarter.

46:52.970 --> 46:54.337
How long does it last?

46:55.338 --> 46:56.173
The changes are permanent

46:56.207 --> 46:58.408
but the serum won't stay potent
forever.

46:59.576 --> 47:01.644
It's probably already starting
to weaken.

47:04.014 --> 47:05.116
What do you mean?

47:05.149 --> 47:08.451
That batch is the last batch
your father ever made.

47:09.987 --> 47:12.022
There will never be any more.

47:12.056 --> 47:12.990
I can make more.

47:14.390 --> 47:16.292
Only your father knows the
process.

47:16.326 --> 47:17.962
He never shared the formula with
anyone

47:17.995 --> 47:19.295
or even wrote it down.

47:19.964 --> 47:20.931
It died with him.

47:21.631 --> 47:26.836
So that vial is the last vial
that might ever exist.

47:27.637 --> 47:30.373
So, how do I know if there'll
be any

47:30.406 --> 47:32.542
unforeseen side effects?

47:32.575 --> 47:33.510
Give me the vial.

47:36.113 --> 47:37.347
I can tell you.

47:53.696 --> 47:56.566
I thought as much, but now I
know.

47:58.068 --> 47:59.103
What?

47:59.136 --> 48:01.905
This is the last batch your
father ever made.

48:01.939 --> 48:03.941
It's the pinnacle of your
father's work.

48:05.009 --> 48:05.909
So it's good?

48:08.678 --> 48:10.880
He told me he perfected it.

48:10.914 --> 48:12.682
That the results would be better

48:12.715 --> 48:15.485
than anything he'd ever hoped
for.

48:15.518 --> 48:17.587
It's a shame that he got killed

48:17.620 --> 48:19.023
before he got to try it first.

48:23.793 --> 48:25.395
Are you okay?

48:25.428 --> 48:26.729
I just can't believe he died

48:26.763 --> 48:28.498
before he got to see the
results.

48:30.034 --> 48:30.900
And you,

48:32.535 --> 48:33.469
his son.

48:34.804 --> 48:37.141
You have the last vial.

48:37.174 --> 48:39.542
It's almost as if everything is
meant to be.

48:40.510 --> 48:41.477
You're blessed.

48:42.313 --> 48:44.982
Maybe we can reverse engineer
it somehow.

48:47.584 --> 48:49.786
It'll just get weaker and
weaker over time.

48:51.454 --> 48:54.791
In 24 hours, it may be
worthless, I don't know.

48:54.824 --> 48:56.459
It might be even worthless now.

49:00.430 --> 49:02.699
Do you think I should drink
it?

49:02.732 --> 49:03.934
If you don't,

49:06.436 --> 49:07.104
can I?

49:30.060 --> 49:31.996
This is for you, dad.

49:35.832 --> 49:36.733
Brad, table.

49:40.703 --> 49:44.440
Rebecca.

49:44.474 --> 49:45.909
Rebecca.

49:45.943 --> 49:46.776
Breathe, breathe.

49:49.013 --> 49:49.913
Brad, she's gone mate.

49:49.947 --> 49:50.981
- No!
- Brad, she's gone.

49:51.015 --> 49:53.017
- No!
- Brad, she's gone.

49:53.050 --> 49:53.984
She's gone.

49:54.985 --> 49:55.852
Okay?

49:56.753 --> 49:57.620
She's gone.

50:16.040 --> 50:17.007
What was that?

50:31.956 --> 50:33.958
- What the fuck?
- Oh, God.

50:33.991 --> 50:35.125
Ollie, grab a knife.

50:35.159 --> 50:36.193
Knife's on the table.

50:38.695 --> 50:40.863
Look, just stay calm, I'm
gonna cut you out, okay?

50:44.268 --> 50:45.568
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

50:48.305 --> 50:49.974
Thank you.

50:50.007 --> 50:53.010
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

50:53.043 --> 50:54.244
No, no, no, no.

51:00.985 --> 51:03.120
What the fuck is going on?

51:14.664 --> 51:15.631
Holy shit!

51:17.800 --> 51:18.668
Jen!

51:19.336 --> 51:20.636
Jen, we've got signal.

51:29.712 --> 51:31.614
Jen, let go of my hand.

51:31.647 --> 51:32.849
Let go of my hand.

51:32.882 --> 51:34.051
Jen, let go.

51:34.084 --> 51:34.917
Jen!

51:34.952 --> 51:35.785
Jen.

51:35.818 --> 51:36.652
Jen.

52:15.159 --> 52:17.660
I don't like the look of
this.

52:17.693 --> 52:18.561
No shit!

52:24.034 --> 52:26.702
The cupboard, go, go, go, go.

54:28.158 --> 54:30.160
Oh, I don't feel so good.

54:30.194 --> 54:32.462
It's a normal part of the
process.

54:32.496 --> 54:34.097
I feel like I wanna be sick.

54:34.797 --> 54:39.036
But at the same time, I wanna
eat a big bloody steak.

54:40.404 --> 54:42.772
Your body is growing and
changing rapidly.

54:43.941 --> 54:45.442
You'll need some protein.

54:56.019 --> 54:58.088
Why the fuck did you bring me
here?

54:58.121 --> 54:59.256
You fucking backstabber.

54:59.289 --> 55:00.224
No.

55:00.257 --> 55:03.360
I'm alive because I've earned
their trust.

55:03.393 --> 55:04.760
You have to do the same.

55:06.829 --> 55:08.198
He's got a vial.

55:08.232 --> 55:10.167
I thought you said I had the
last one.

55:10.900 --> 55:14.037
He doesn't have the perfected
batch like yours.

55:14.071 --> 55:15.305
Are you lying to me?

55:22.179 --> 55:23.779
Mr. Kenning's son, he's with
us.

55:40.896 --> 55:42.499
Was that it?

55:42.532 --> 55:43.400
Am I safe?

55:44.401 --> 55:45.269
No.

55:47.371 --> 55:48.238
Prove your worth.

55:49.940 --> 55:51.308
What are you talking about?

55:52.842 --> 55:55.178
You must fight one of the
tribe.

56:46.096 --> 56:47.130
There.

56:47.164 --> 56:49.066
Does that prove my worth?

56:49.099 --> 56:51.501
You've defeated the weakest
member of the tribe.

56:52.569 --> 56:54.538
Now the tribe lives within you.

56:55.505 --> 56:57.107
Whoa, I beat him.

56:58.175 --> 56:59.443
I won!

56:59.476 --> 57:00.344
I won!

57:08.051 --> 57:09.319
Now what?

57:09.353 --> 57:11.221
You have to kill the one you
beat.

57:12.956 --> 57:15.492
He's no longer a member of the
tribe.

01:02:41.618 --> 01:02:43.253
Come on, Caitlin.

01:02:43.286 --> 01:02:43.954
Where are you?

01:02:45.422 --> 01:02:47.557
These tunnels can't go on
forever.

01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:48.792
We'll run into her eventually.

01:02:51.795 --> 01:02:53.329
They just don't give up, do
they?

01:02:57.001 --> 01:02:58.568
Ollie, back-to-back.

01:02:58.601 --> 01:02:59.536
You deal with everything in this
direction,

01:02:59.569 --> 01:03:01.805
I'll deal with everything in
that direction.

01:03:02.806 --> 01:03:03.941
Any Army tips for me?

01:03:03.974 --> 01:03:05.475
Yeah, don't get hit.

01:03:08.511 --> 01:03:10.847
Switch sides, switch sides.

01:03:28.832 --> 01:03:30.700
Did you see that shit?

01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:33.837
Ollie!

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.989
How's your injury?

01:04:25.022 --> 01:04:26.123
Injury?

01:04:26.157 --> 01:04:28.926
Did you not see me fighting with
my usual high standards?

01:04:28.959 --> 01:04:29.793
I didn't notice.

01:04:29.826 --> 01:04:31.594
Well, that's harsh.

01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:35.465
He didn't make it.

01:04:35.498 --> 01:04:36.967
No one made it.

01:04:37.001 --> 01:04:38.902
Maybe that prick, Richard
Kenning.

01:04:38.936 --> 01:04:40.370
So, where is he?

01:04:40.403 --> 01:04:42.072
He run off with some woman we
found.

01:04:42.106 --> 01:04:42.772
Some woman?

01:04:42.806 --> 01:04:43.974
She works with Kenning's dad.

01:04:44.008 --> 01:04:46.944
She said that apparently, they
made all of these monsters

01:04:46.977 --> 01:04:48.545
out of the homeless people.

01:04:48.578 --> 01:04:49.445
Jesus!

01:04:50.814 --> 01:04:52.715
We need to get out of here,
Brad.

01:04:52.749 --> 01:04:54.118
I don't wanna leave him.

01:04:54.151 --> 01:04:55.685
We need to prioritize our
safety.

01:04:55.718 --> 01:04:57.554
We're gonna have to come back
for him.

01:04:58.488 --> 01:04:59.556
Yes, ma'am.

01:05:26.683 --> 01:05:27.550
What's going on?

01:05:27.584 --> 01:05:29.519
They're questioning your
presence.

01:05:29.552 --> 01:05:30.988
I've already proved my worth.

01:06:09.626 --> 01:06:12.795
You lied to me, I know you
did.

01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:13.696
You bitch!

01:06:16.532 --> 01:06:18.501
What have you done to me?

01:06:18.534 --> 01:06:19.203
I've turned you into
something

01:06:19.236 --> 01:06:21.638
your father would be proud of.

01:06:21.671 --> 01:06:23.140
Why?

01:06:23.173 --> 01:06:24.908
Because you're just like your
father.

01:06:24.942 --> 01:06:25.909
Bullshit!

01:06:26.944 --> 01:06:28.045
Remember what you said

01:06:28.078 --> 01:06:30.613
about making worthless lives
useful?

01:06:31.681 --> 01:06:33.650
You're eager to continue his
work.

01:06:33.683 --> 01:06:34.550
Bitch.

01:06:36.186 --> 01:06:38.454
It wasn't one of his creations
that killed him.

01:06:38.488 --> 01:06:39.156
It was you.

01:06:41.658 --> 01:06:42.960
Don't strain yourself.

01:06:42.993 --> 01:06:44.761
It'll just make the pain worse.

01:06:45.963 --> 01:06:47.830
Get back here.

01:06:47.864 --> 01:06:49.532
Bitch!

01:07:06.050 --> 01:07:06.951
Jesus, Caitlin.

01:07:07.684 --> 01:07:10.054
You paid attention in basic
training.

01:07:10.087 --> 01:07:11.088
That should do it.

01:07:12.056 --> 01:07:14.091
So, they draw first blood?

01:07:35.812 --> 01:07:37.214
Who are you, Mary Poppins?

01:07:37.247 --> 01:07:38.815
Where did you get all that
stuff?

01:07:38.848 --> 01:07:40.250
Found a little storage room.

01:07:41.651 --> 01:07:42.685
These things must have raided

01:07:42.719 --> 01:07:44.121
that disused mine we drove past.

01:07:44.154 --> 01:07:44.787
Yeah.

01:07:44.821 --> 01:07:45.990
I reckon all these tunnels,

01:07:46.023 --> 01:07:47.623
they're all connected somehow.

01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:53.896
Seriously?

01:07:57.001 --> 01:07:58.969
And to think Kenning's dad
was experimenting

01:07:59.003 --> 01:08:00.304
on all these poor souls,

01:08:00.337 --> 01:08:02.006
and everyone thought he was
helping them.

01:08:02.039 --> 01:08:03.273
Whoever they were,

01:08:03.307 --> 01:08:06.210
their personalities have long
been erased.

01:08:06.243 --> 01:08:08.012
Whatever he did to them,

01:08:08.045 --> 01:08:11.115
I don't even think you can call
them human anymore.

01:08:11.148 --> 01:08:12.782
Just like animals.

01:08:12.815 --> 01:08:13.716
Mindless,

01:08:15.085 --> 01:08:16.519
just run on instinct.

01:08:18.654 --> 01:08:21.225
Okay, I think we're good until
we get you to a doctor.

01:08:24.094 --> 01:08:25.728
I hate you.

01:08:25.761 --> 01:08:26.964
You big baby.

01:08:31.969 --> 01:08:33.002
I swear to God, Caitlin,

01:08:33.037 --> 01:08:36.140
if we get out of this, we
getting different jobs?

01:08:36.173 --> 01:08:37.807
We?

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:39.109
Yeah!

01:08:39.143 --> 01:08:40.010
We.

01:08:50.787 --> 01:08:51.621
We need to go.

01:08:51.654 --> 01:08:56.658
Yeah.

01:09:17.214 --> 01:09:19.316
Please, I'm not looking for a
fight.

01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:20.551
Who's this?

01:09:20.582 --> 01:09:22.386
This is the evil bitch who
was helping old man Kenning

01:09:22.419 --> 01:09:23.987
with his experiments.

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:26.990
I didn't help Kenning, I
stopped him.

01:09:27.024 --> 01:09:28.325
And we are meant to believe
you why?

01:09:28.358 --> 01:09:30.294
I literally just saved your
lives.

01:09:30.327 --> 01:09:31.428
I'm not buying it.

01:09:31.462 --> 01:09:34.231
You run off the very second that
Rebecca was attacked.

01:09:34.264 --> 01:09:36.799
I had to get away for my own
safety.

01:09:36.832 --> 01:09:39.734
I didn't know who yo guys were
or if I could trust you.

01:09:39.769 --> 01:09:41.770
Rich was the one that followed
me.

01:09:41.804 --> 01:09:43.872
So, what do you want now?

01:09:43.906 --> 01:09:46.243
I wanna burn this place down
to the ground.

01:09:46.276 --> 01:09:48.911
Anyone who has a similar goal is
an ally of mine.

01:09:48.946 --> 01:09:51.747
And what about your newfound
friend, Rich?

01:09:51.781 --> 01:09:54.384
I told you he followed me.

01:09:54.418 --> 01:09:55.918
He's obsessed with his dad,

01:09:55.953 --> 01:09:57.653
he thought I had all the
answers.

01:10:00.457 --> 01:10:01.757
I didn't help Kenning.

01:10:02.725 --> 01:10:03.860
I was abducted.

01:10:04.928 --> 01:10:06.029
I'd lost everything.

01:10:07.297 --> 01:10:09.166
I didn't know anyone in this
country.

01:10:11.368 --> 01:10:13.971
I came to the farm because there
was a generous man

01:10:14.004 --> 01:10:16.706
who offered to help people down
on their luck.

01:10:16.739 --> 01:10:18.741
When Kenning first brought me
down here,

01:10:19.543 --> 01:10:22.312
he was going to experiment on
me.

01:10:22.346 --> 01:10:24.148
But I managed to get out of it.

01:10:24.181 --> 01:10:25.748
So why didn't you escape?

01:10:25.781 --> 01:10:27.317
When Dr. Kenning died,

01:10:27.351 --> 01:10:30.087
I thought that escaping this
place would be easy.

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.755
But his creatures go wild
without their leader.

01:10:33.557 --> 01:10:35.392
They didn't kill me but they
didn't want me to leave.

01:10:35.425 --> 01:10:36.859
So, where's Rich now?

01:10:36.893 --> 01:10:38.195
I forced him to drink the
medicine

01:10:38.228 --> 01:10:40.030
before he could force it on
anyone else.

01:10:40.063 --> 01:10:42.032
What does the medicine do?

01:10:42.065 --> 01:10:44.001
It turns you into these
monsters.

01:10:45.335 --> 01:10:47.437
One of his father's tribe.

01:10:47.471 --> 01:10:49.239
So Rich is one of them now?

01:10:49.273 --> 01:10:52.075
He's still turning, but he
will be.

01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:54.311
Brilliant.

01:10:54.344 --> 01:10:57.047
So now he's gonna be twice as
fast, twice as strong

01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.215
and twice as stupid.

01:10:59.149 --> 01:11:00.783
You wanna destroy this place?

01:11:02.186 --> 01:11:04.188
We need to find somewhere to
plant these.

01:11:04.221 --> 01:11:05.289
Follow me.

01:11:19.369 --> 01:11:21.104
That stupid bitch.

01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:24.840
I do feel stronger.

01:11:26.343 --> 01:11:28.212
That vial hasn't done me any
harm.

01:11:30.846 --> 01:11:33.483
My Kenning blood has kept me
strong.

01:11:35.285 --> 01:11:36.353
Give me another vial.

01:11:38.388 --> 01:11:39.323
I'll be even stronger.

01:11:45.395 --> 01:11:48.198
Don't you know all this is mine?

01:11:48.232 --> 01:11:50.033
My dad made you.

01:11:50.067 --> 01:11:51.101
You're mine.

01:11:59.576 --> 01:12:01.311
Where are you going?

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.514
Is it that bitch?

01:12:14.857 --> 01:12:17.294
This is a part of the old
mining pit.

01:12:17.327 --> 01:12:18.996
It's directly under the cave
system

01:12:19.029 --> 01:12:20.097
where Kenning's creations live.

01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:22.499
And what's with the
explosives?

01:12:22.532 --> 01:12:23.967
Left over from the mine.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:27.237
So, if we blow this place
up...

01:12:28.038 --> 01:12:29.872
Their whole world will
collapse.

01:12:29.905 --> 01:12:31.241
And it'll finally be over.

01:12:32.376 --> 01:12:34.077
Let's see what's in those
barrels.

01:12:54.531 --> 01:12:55.365
Can I help?

01:12:55.399 --> 01:12:57.034
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:12:57.067 --> 01:12:58.068
Be careful.

01:12:58.101 --> 01:12:59.369
This stuff is really volatile.

01:12:59.403 --> 01:13:00.836
The chemical compounds in
dynamite

01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:02.439
haven't changed for 200 years.

01:13:12.049 --> 01:13:14.518
Very knowledgeable, for a man
with muscles

01:13:14.551 --> 01:13:16.320
where his brain should be.

01:13:16.353 --> 01:13:19.122
You're looking a little under
the weather there, Rich.

01:13:19.156 --> 01:13:22.993
Did you really think I was
gonna let you destroy

01:13:23.026 --> 01:13:25.295
my dad's legacy?

01:13:26.096 --> 01:13:29.066
You're just another sick,
twisted prick,

01:13:29.099 --> 01:13:30.300
just like your father.

01:13:30.334 --> 01:13:34.538
Well, they say the apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

01:13:41.445 --> 01:13:46.450
This guy will kill all three of
you with his bare hands.

01:13:49.686 --> 01:13:50.620
Go get her.

01:13:52.055 --> 01:13:53.924
He looks like he's taken his
juice.

01:13:55.692 --> 01:13:57.127
Let's go daddy's boy.

01:15:40.163 --> 01:15:42.999
They're twice as fast, twice
as strong.

01:15:43.033 --> 01:15:44.401
Stop!

01:15:44.434 --> 01:15:45.502
Your mom!

01:15:45.535 --> 01:15:46.703
Twice as stupid.

01:18:26.529 --> 01:18:27.397
Caitlin.

01:18:28.898 --> 01:18:29.766
Help me.

01:18:31.201 --> 01:18:31.868
Brad.

01:18:38.341 --> 01:18:39.209
Hey.

01:18:40.543 --> 01:18:41.678
Scared you'd lost me?

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:44.648
That's good.

01:18:47.283 --> 01:18:48.151
Maya.

01:19:08.271 --> 01:19:09.606
I'm sorry.

01:19:09.639 --> 01:19:11.307
Sorry for what?

01:19:11.341 --> 01:19:13.410
I didn't attach the last
explosive on time.

01:19:13.443 --> 01:19:15.245
No worries, we can do it.

01:19:15.946 --> 01:19:18.248
Hold this, apply pressure.

01:19:19.616 --> 01:19:21.518
You don't understand.

01:19:21.551 --> 01:19:23.253
They're attracted to the noise.

01:19:23.286 --> 01:19:24.955
This place is going to be filled
with creatures,

01:19:24.989 --> 01:19:26.957
you guys won't be able to fight
them.

01:19:26.991 --> 01:19:28.625
Then we need to get you out
of here.

01:19:28.658 --> 01:19:29.659
I'm not going anywhere.

01:19:29.693 --> 01:19:30.827
And I'm not leaving you
behind.

01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:31.929
We can get you help.

01:19:31.962 --> 01:19:33.596
I'm losing too much blood.

01:19:34.264 --> 01:19:36.533
I'll die either in here or out
there.

01:19:37.767 --> 01:19:39.602
I'd rather die knowing that I
took this place

01:19:39.636 --> 01:19:41.237
to hell with me.

01:19:41.271 --> 01:19:42.006
What are you saying?

01:19:42.039 --> 01:19:43.640
Even if you could save me,

01:19:44.774 --> 01:19:46.309
I don't wanna live in a world

01:19:46.342 --> 01:19:47.877
where this place still exists.

01:19:51.347 --> 01:19:53.017
We can't let you do that.

01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:54.718
You have no choice.

01:19:54.751 --> 01:19:56.720
I'm going to blow this place up,

01:19:56.753 --> 01:19:58.254
whether you're here or not.

01:19:59.422 --> 01:20:00.390
Come on.

01:20:00.423 --> 01:20:02.325
Come on, Caitlin

01:20:02.358 --> 01:20:03.626
Go!

01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:04.494
Run!

01:21:26.944 --> 01:21:29.079
That's it, I'm done.

01:21:29.113 --> 01:21:30.847
I'm serving cocktails on a
beach.

01:21:31.681 --> 01:21:34.818
What, with shit pay and lousy
tourists?

01:21:35.986 --> 01:21:38.855
No responsibilities, good
weather.

01:21:38.888 --> 01:21:40.958
Yeah, the easy life.
