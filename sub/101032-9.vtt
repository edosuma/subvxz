17:23.292 --> 17:26.964
I can't leave this house, dear.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.800
Because of what your father
did to me.

17:29.925 --> 17:31.593
To us.

17:31.718 --> 17:32.886
Because of who he is.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.222
<i>J' That I love you so J'</i>

17:35.347 --> 17:37.599
<i>J' I can't pretend that I don't J'</i>

17:37.724 --> 17:41.103
You always were
a terrible dancer, Charles.

17:41.228 --> 17:44.773
My father even paid for classes,
but it didn't help.

17:44.898 --> 17:48.527
See, you were so sure
it was your role to lead.

17:48.652 --> 17:52.114
All you did your entire life

17:52.239 --> 17:56.660
was spin us around in circles
and trip over your feet.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.912
As a driver.

17:59.037 --> 18:03.709
Farmer. Husband. Father.

18:03.834 --> 18:05.544
CHARLIE MANX: That's not true.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.838
I did more for this family
than you ever did. I...

18:07.963 --> 18:09.840
[Breathing heavily]

18:09.965 --> 18:11.967
I made our daughter happy.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.552
CASSIE: With candy and presents?

18:13.677 --> 18:15.012
Yes, Charles.

18:15.137 --> 18:17.389
I'm familiar with the speech.

18:17.514 --> 18:23.061
You say that Christmasland
is a safe haven for children.

18:23.186 --> 18:25.939
But really, it's a place
for you to escape yourself.

18:26.064 --> 18:29.192
A place where you
are not a failure,

18:29.318 --> 18:33.280
where you are not a coward
who devoured his own family

18:33.405 --> 18:36.575
to feed his insatiable ego.

18:36.700 --> 18:41.580
That is why it will all
turn to static!

18:41.705 --> 18:43.332
[Breathing heavily]

18:45.250 --> 18:48.086
How's that gonna happen,
Cassie?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.381
I'm immortal.

18:51.506 --> 18:54.551
Christmasland is forever.

18:54.676 --> 18:56.595
No one can breach it
without my say.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.513
Victoria McQueen can.

18:58.639 --> 19:00.223
No.

19:00.349 --> 19:02.184
She's already here.

19:05.604 --> 19:07.731
Wait! No!
No, no, wait, please, please!

19:07.856 --> 19:09.650
Mama, come with us.

19:09.775 --> 19:12.069
Listen to me, Millie, darling.

19:12.194 --> 19:14.029
If your father truly loves you,

19:14.154 --> 19:15.656
he will take you
away from this place

19:15.781 --> 19:19.076
before Vic McQueen
unleashes the Great White Static

19:19.201 --> 19:20.994
that takes us all!

19:21.119 --> 19:23.288
- Mommy! Please!
- Let's go. No.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.168
Go. Outside.

19:28.293 --> 19:30.796
If we go back to Christmasland,
we'll die.

19:30.921 --> 19:32.589
Millie --

19:32.714 --> 19:34.049
We can live in the real world.

19:34.174 --> 19:36.468
Me a-and you together.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.261
Please, Father.

19:44.935 --> 19:47.270
Let's go.

19:56.822 --> 19:59.074
TABITHA: How long do we wait?

19:59.199 --> 20:00.117
Forever?

20:00.242 --> 20:03.995
Been waiting on Vic to get back
from fighting Charlie Manx

20:04.121 --> 20:07.541
for eight years, so...

20:09.793 --> 20:11.628
...yep.

20:13.255 --> 20:18.552
Thanks for coming all this way,
helping out with all this --

20:18.677 --> 20:20.679
You know, Vic's Dad.

20:28.895 --> 20:31.022
You know I haven't had one
of these in over a decade?

20:31.148 --> 20:34.025
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

20:34.151 --> 20:35.986
I told myself
all the best agents

20:36.111 --> 20:38.238
had to be lean and mean, y'know?

20:38.363 --> 20:41.241
[Laughs]

20:41.366 --> 20:43.410
Should probably quit myself.

20:43.535 --> 20:44.745
Mm.

20:44.870 --> 20:46.121
Heart stent.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.539
Jesus, Lou.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.624
[Laughs]

20:49.750 --> 20:51.793
I know.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.337
I know.

20:54.463 --> 20:56.298
As soon as Vic
and Wayne get back.

20:56.423 --> 20:57.591
TABITHA: Mm.

20:57.716 --> 21:00.469
I'm here for Maggie.

21:02.596 --> 21:04.639
Have you seen her use her Bag?

21:04.765 --> 21:06.767
[Scoffs]

21:06.892 --> 21:08.852
And her cigarettes?

21:08.977 --> 21:11.271
Reminded rne of Vic
and her whiskey.

21:11.396 --> 21:12.898
TABITHA: Mm-hmm.

21:13.023 --> 21:17.569
When I saw the burns,
I told myself I was done.

21:17.694 --> 21:20.071
But here I am again, just...

21:20.197 --> 21:22.949
showing up, waiting.

21:23.074 --> 21:25.786
It's pathetic, huh?

21:27.370 --> 21:32.584
Vic lit our house on fire,
and I'm still here.

21:34.377 --> 21:37.839
Shit, I'd probably
stand next to her in hell

21:37.964 --> 21:41.968
if it meant I could be with her
just a little longer.

21:42.093 --> 21:45.722
I keep telling myself it's
for love, and I do love her...

21:45.847 --> 21:47.933
and for Wayne.

21:48.058 --> 21:52.437
I love that little dude more
than anything in the world.

21:55.816 --> 22:00.320
But maybe I'm just a coward
who's afraid of being alone.

22:06.910 --> 22:09.871
I don't know what I'll do
if they don't come back.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.207
They will.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.751
With Maggie.

22:32.769 --> 22:34.479
That's him. I see him.

22:34.604 --> 22:37.107
[Laughter]

22:46.157 --> 22:48.577
Wayne.

22:53.081 --> 22:55.041
Wayne, Wayne, it's Morn.

22:56.418 --> 22:58.628
Hey!
You're too old to be here!

22:58.753 --> 23:01.089
- Shh, shh! Okay, okay.
- BOY: Mr. Manx! Mr. Manx!

23:01.214 --> 23:02.632
Grown-ups in Christmasland!

23:02.757 --> 23:03.842
Drifters!

23:03.967 --> 23:05.802
Everybody come look!

23:10.098 --> 23:12.017
Come on.

23:12.142 --> 23:13.476
[Gasps]

23:34.789 --> 23:37.375
CHARLIE MANX: Victoria McQueen!

24:03.026 --> 24:05.862
Welcome to Christmasland.

24:17.958 --> 24:22.879
J' ...Bethlehem,
how still we see thee lie J'

24:23.004 --> 24:25.465
VIC: Let's go, Wayne.

24:25.590 --> 24:26.925
Come on.

24:27.050 --> 24:29.970
J' Above thy deep
and dreamless sleep J'

24:30.095 --> 24:31.972
J' The silent... J'

24:32.097 --> 24:33.306
CHARLIE MANX:
But he likes it here.

24:33.431 --> 24:38.061
At home with me
and all his new friends.

24:38.186 --> 24:39.896
Isn't that right, Wayne?

24:40.021 --> 24:41.272
Mm-hmm.

24:41.398 --> 24:43.441
Why would you spoil that?

24:43.566 --> 24:44.985
Don't listen to
a word he says, Wayne.

24:45.110 --> 24:48.655
Do you hear me?

24:48.780 --> 24:50.657
- Wayne McQueen --
- That's not my name.

24:50.782 --> 24:53.034
Oh. [Laughs]

24:57.080 --> 24:59.165
He's hurting you.

24:59.290 --> 25:00.417
He's making you forget
who you are.

25:00.542 --> 25:01.668
This isn't your home.

25:01.793 --> 25:03.128
Rubbish.

25:03.253 --> 25:05.588
This place is a salve
for children who are suffering.

25:05.714 --> 25:07.340
Wayne's healing has just begun.

25:07.465 --> 25:09.217
He's happy here!

25:09.342 --> 25:12.679
Just like all
of my other little ones.

25:12.804 --> 25:14.222
Besides your daughter,
you mean?

25:16.725 --> 25:20.437
My Bridge didn't get rne here
on its own, Charlie.

25:20.562 --> 25:22.272
Ask her, Wayne.

25:22.397 --> 25:24.774
If she's so happy here, why does
she want a ride out from me?

25:26.234 --> 25:28.319
Go on, Millie, tell Wayne.

25:31.031 --> 25:33.158
Tell -- Tell him the truth.

25:40.582 --> 25:44.544
She won't say it because she is
scared, but she wants to leave.

25:44.669 --> 25:47.547
Her father won't let her
because he is a monster!

25:47.672 --> 25:48.631
He took her away from her morn.

25:48.757 --> 25:50.341
He took you away from me.

25:50.467 --> 25:52.093
You don't belong here!

25:52.218 --> 25:53.136
None of you do.

25:53.261 --> 25:54.512
[indistinct whispering]

25:59.851 --> 26:01.478
Millie, I will keep my word.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.063
You can live
in the Real World,

26:03.188 --> 26:05.231
maybe even see
the Great Wall of China one day.

26:05.356 --> 26:08.902
Your father took that from you,
but you can take it back.

26:09.027 --> 26:10.320
You can take it back.
Just bring Wayne to me.

26:10.445 --> 26:12.781
You'll both be free.

26:12.906 --> 26:14.240
It's your choice.

26:16.534 --> 26:19.954
Why don't we let Wayne choose?

26:21.998 --> 26:24.751
All of my children are free
to do whatever they please

26:24.876 --> 26:26.753
in Christmasland.

26:26.878 --> 26:30.465
If Wayne wants to leave with
you, he's more than welcome.

26:32.217 --> 26:34.094
What do you want, Wayne?

26:34.219 --> 26:38.056
Do you want to go
with...her...

26:40.016 --> 26:44.312
...or do you want to stay
with me in Christmasland?

26:45.688 --> 26:47.857
Come on, Bats. Let's go home.

26:52.112 --> 26:54.114
Why would we ever leave?

26:54.239 --> 26:57.992
We just got here.

26:58.118 --> 26:59.869
You heard the boy.

26:59.994 --> 27:03.414
He prefers to celebrate
Christmas.

27:06.126 --> 27:08.503
Seems like we have
some drifters among us.

27:08.628 --> 27:10.463
Vic McQueen.

27:10.588 --> 27:14.050
[Click, ticking]

27:14.175 --> 27:15.760
Margaret Leigh.

27:21.933 --> 27:24.519
Scissors for the Drifter,
everyone!

27:24.644 --> 27:27.230
[All shouting]

27:37.532 --> 27:39.117
DEMON MIKE:
Hey! No fair!

27:39.242 --> 27:42.453
- Open up!
- We just wanna play with you!

27:42.579 --> 27:44.372
'Open up!
- Hey!

27:48.168 --> 27:49.085
[Door opens]

27:49.210 --> 27:50.837
- Get her!
- Get her!

27:50.962 --> 27:53.339
[All shouting]

27:58.052 --> 28:00.138
[Slow music playing]

28:13.985 --> 28:16.821
[Click]

28:30.376 --> 28:33.129
[Laughter]

28:44.807 --> 28:46.100
- Pretty.
- MAGGIE: Yeah.

28:46.226 --> 28:48.353
Now give it back.

28:50.563 --> 28:51.981
Red light!

28:53.399 --> 28:54.943
I said red light!

28:55.068 --> 28:57.987
New game. [Growls]

28:59.989 --> 29:01.866
Give it back.

29:11.292 --> 29:13.878
[All shout]

29:26.349 --> 29:28.643
[Breathing heavily]

29:39.862 --> 29:41.281
Ah! [Screaming]

29:45.201 --> 29:46.619
[Explosion]

29:50.039 --> 29:51.749
[Laughter]

29:51.874 --> 29:53.042
[Tree creaking]

29:53.167 --> 29:54.752
[Glass shattering]

29:54.877 --> 29:56.129
[Bang]

29:56.254 --> 29:57.505
[Breathing heavily]

29:57.630 --> 29:59.507
Thank you, Maggie.

29:59.632 --> 30:01.384
[Breathing heavily]

30:04.053 --> 30:05.513
[Laughter]

30:08.725 --> 30:11.519
[Breathing heavily]

30:11.644 --> 30:13.146
CHILD: This Way!

30:18.526 --> 30:20.069
The Great Tree.

30:20.194 --> 30:22.363
We dreamt it up together,
branch by branch,

30:22.488 --> 30:24.991
and now it's gone.

30:26.784 --> 30:27.952
But I don't blame you.

30:28.077 --> 30:29.704
You're not the first person

30:29.829 --> 30:33.082
Vic McQueen
has twisted into knots.

30:33.207 --> 30:36.210
She poisoned you,
along with your mother.

30:36.336 --> 30:39.172
Convinced you to doubt
your own father.

30:39.297 --> 30:41.549
Take your sword.

30:41.674 --> 30:44.594
We'll hang her head
on a new tree by morning,

30:44.719 --> 30:46.721
and all will be forgiven.

30:46.846 --> 30:49.223
Sta)'-

30:49.349 --> 30:51.809
Like you promised.

30:51.934 --> 30:55.229
Let Vic McQueen leave with Wayne
and stay here with rne.

30:55.355 --> 30:57.899
Millicent, stop it.
You know I have work to do.

30:58.024 --> 31:00.651
And that wouldn't be
very fair to Wayne.

31:03.821 --> 31:05.698
I'm not enough.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.953
I never was.

31:12.622 --> 31:16.042
You are my joy, my everything.

31:16.167 --> 31:19.545
But Vic McQueen is trying to
destroy everything we built,

31:19.670 --> 31:23.716
and she will, too, if we don't
stop her together here and now.

31:25.218 --> 31:26.928
I begged for you to leave,

31:27.053 --> 31:30.556
for us to leave this place
together, and you wouldn't.

31:30.681 --> 31:35.520
And now I ask you to stay,
and you won't do that, either?

31:40.942 --> 31:42.652
I'm leaving.

31:42.777 --> 31:45.238
No, you're not going anywhere.

31:46.656 --> 31:49.409
Yes, I am.

31:49.534 --> 31:52.120
One way or another.

31:52.245 --> 31:53.579
Unless...

31:56.165 --> 31:59.710
You wouldn't raise your hand
to a child, would you, Father?

31:59.836 --> 32:04.757
I am your father, and you
will do exactly as I say.

32:06.843 --> 32:11.097
If you wanna hang
Vic McQueen's head on a tree,

32:11.222 --> 32:12.723
do it yourself.

32:14.684 --> 32:16.561
Merry Christmas, Father.

32:34.537 --> 32:35.830
[Explosion]

32:39.750 --> 32:41.711
[Coughing]

32:53.556 --> 32:54.974
[All shouting, laughter]

33:09.864 --> 33:12.742
[Click, ticking]

33:12.867 --> 33:13.868
CHILD: This Way!

33:17.872 --> 33:22.960
ALL: J' In Christmasland,
we'll build a snowgirl J'

33:23.085 --> 33:26.506
J' And make believe
that she's a silly clown J'

33:26.631 --> 33:29.467
J' We'll have lots of fun
with Missus Snowgirl J'

33:29.592 --> 33:33.554
J' Until the other kiddies
cut her down J'

33:34.639 --> 33:36.557
[Cheers and applause]

33:36.682 --> 33:39.560
[Children shouting]

33:42.230 --> 33:44.273
Wayne. Wayne.

33:44.398 --> 33:46.275
Wayne.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.152
It's me. It's Morn.
VVayne.

33:48.277 --> 33:49.445
Come here.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.823
Wayne! Stop.

33:52.949 --> 33:54.825
Wayne, stop!
