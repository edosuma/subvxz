00:06.875 --> 00:09.734
Yeah, you think you're pretty
way up there but I can get you!

00:09.750 --> 00:11.477
나 잡아봐봐~
("Catch me if you can.")

00:11.508 --> 00:12.312
Yeah!

00:12.336 --> 00:15.912
Let me just add three more drops
of explosive diarrhea...

00:19.154 --> 00:20.396
Hey Princess Bubblegum

00:20.427 --> 00:21.841
when we bring the dead back to life

00:21.865 --> 00:23.342
will it be filled with worms?!?

00:23.357 --> 00:25.755
No. If my decorpsinator
serum works

00:25.787 --> 00:28.888
then all the dead Candy People will look
as young and healthy as you do.

00:31.914 --> 00:33.429
Pick up that platter, tough guy.

00:35.195 --> 00:36.578
Old Mr. Cream Puff?

00:37.179 --> 00:38.491
We used to date

00:40.779 --> 00:41.966
Something's happening!

00:42.021 --> 00:44.123
Come on, come on...

00:48.185 --> 00:49.310
Algebraic!!!

00:49.450 --> 00:50.786
Wait, something's wrong.

00:50.873 --> 00:52.255
SUGAR!

00:59.943 --> 01:02.865
Hey look, the decorpsinator serum
is working!

01:03.037 --> 01:04.372
No, this is wrong.

01:04.435 --> 01:07.318
They're not coming back to
life--they're still dead!

01:07.412 --> 01:10.326
My decorpsinator serum--it's incomplete!

01:11.138 --> 01:13.388
Must...Eat...Sugar!

01:14.286 --> 01:15.763
You're grounded, Mister.

01:15.865 --> 01:17.286
Oh, this is really bad.

01:17.372 --> 01:19.497
They're going to be attracted
to the Candy Kingdom!

01:19.716 --> 01:20.193
Why?

01:20.240 --> 01:22.107
Because the Candy People

01:22.133 --> 01:24.122
are made of sugar, ya ding dong!

01:24.396 --> 01:26.490
Give me some sugar, baby.

01:26.927 --> 01:28.021
Chew on this!

01:28.708 --> 01:29.560
Good one, Finn.

01:29.833 --> 01:31.724
Quickly, to the kingdom!

01:31.950 --> 01:32.841
Get a life!

01:34.231 --> 01:38.246
All citizens of the Candy Kingdom!
Report to the palace...

01:38.262 --> 01:39.637
Immediately!

01:46.363 --> 01:48.481
Hurry, sweet citizens...

01:48.707 --> 01:50.520
Alright!
you heard the princess...

01:50.755 --> 01:51.864
Everyone in!

01:51.958 --> 01:53.778
Alright no pushing, come on!

01:53.793 --> 01:54.755
Dude, what's up?

01:54.841 --> 01:56.583
The princess will explain everything.

01:56.661 --> 01:59.286
Tree Trunks,
get those hot buns in here, girl.

01:59.341 --> 02:02.005
Oh, I hope it's not bad news.

02:03.221 --> 02:04.510
Did we get everyone?

02:04.752 --> 02:07.267
All present and accounted for.

02:07.283 --> 02:08.119
Thanks, Manfried.

02:08.157 --> 02:10.033
You're welcome.

02:10.096 --> 02:11.198
Citizens

02:11.229 --> 02:13.690
we are assembled here in the candy foyer

02:13.713 --> 02:15.690
for a momentous announcement.

02:15.908 --> 02:18.635
Tonight we are all going to have...

02:18.775 --> 02:19.932
...a slumber party!

02:19.963 --> 02:20.338
What?!?

02:22.604 --> 02:23.674
Wait! What about the zom--

02:23.705 --> 02:25.542
Go ahead and start partying.

02:25.603 --> 02:27.127
But, Princess, the undead--

02:27.635 --> 02:28.986
We'll be right back everyone.

02:30.665 --> 02:33.650
Finn, the Candy People can't know
about the zombies.

02:33.767 --> 02:34.267
Wha?!?

02:34.291 --> 02:36.423
If they knew, they would flip out.

02:36.462 --> 02:37.915
What do you mean, "flip out"?

02:37.962 --> 02:39.017
I mean...

02:39.056 --> 02:40.415
...they would flip...

02:40.446 --> 02:41.993
...out!

02:42.392 --> 02:43.446
Princess?

02:43.470 --> 02:45.361
It's me, Starchy the gravedigger.

02:45.384 --> 02:46.987
I brought you a larger corpse shovel.

02:47.783 --> 02:48.587
Oh, Princess?

02:48.963 --> 02:50.596
Well, I'll just wait
for you here, then...

02:50.681 --> 02:51.830
...by the mausoleum...

02:51.853 --> 02:52.931
...with my back turned...

02:52.955 --> 02:54.549
...and my defenses lowered.

02:57.861 --> 02:59.275
SUGAR!

03:07.538 --> 03:09.890
Candy People explode
when they get scared?!?

03:09.906 --> 03:11.999
Not telling the Candy People
about the zombies

03:12.023 --> 03:14.398
is so important that you need to promise

03:14.547 --> 03:16.586
<i>Royal Promise</i>

03:16.602 --> 03:19.711
not to let anyone find out
about the zombies...

03:19.735 --> 03:20.250
<i>...ever!</i>

03:20.266 --> 03:21.196
Okay, sure.

03:21.243 --> 03:23.626
No, Finn. You have to <i>Royal Promise</i>!

03:23.649 --> 03:25.673
Yes, I Royal Promise.

03:25.696 --> 03:27.547
Now I must cloister myself in the lab

03:27.555 --> 03:29.901
and finish the equation to my
decorpsinator serum.

03:29.922 --> 03:32.157
You keep the candy folk
distracted and ignorant.

03:32.172 --> 03:33.016
Can you do that?

03:33.047 --> 03:34.110
Yes, Your Highness.

03:34.156 --> 03:36.438
Good. Don't tell anyone about the zombies.

03:36.469 --> 03:37.257
Never ever.

03:37.289 --> 03:37.844
No, wait...

03:37.867 --> 03:39.054
...can I at least tell Jake?

03:39.078 --> 03:40.656
Tell me about what, dude?

03:40.734 --> 03:42.594
You know, about the outbreak of zom--

03:43.500 --> 03:45.414
Alright, what's going on?

03:46.094 --> 03:47.398
Uhh, nothing at all, buddy!

03:48.930 --> 03:51.664
Hey, dude. I think you and Bubblegum
are up to something.

03:51.735 --> 03:54.078
Ahha ah, what? No, no way.

03:54.102 --> 03:56.773
Whoa, you guys are up to something.

03:56.789 --> 03:58.086
Is it some sort of prank?

03:58.109 --> 03:59.234
Can I get in on it?

03:59.274 --> 04:00.610
Who wants to play "Truth or Dare"?

04:01.633 --> 04:03.274
Ok, Chocoberry,

04:03.312 --> 04:06.914
you may choose someone to ask
a deep truth or a saucy dare.

04:06.946 --> 04:08.516
Mr. Cupcake

04:08.571 --> 04:10.172
truth or dare?

04:10.211 --> 04:10.992
Dare.

04:11.023 --> 04:13.172
I dare you to take off your wrapper.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.063
Hey seriously, man.
I'm your bro.

04:18.077 --> 04:20.774
Bros are supposed to tell bros
everything all the time.

04:20.789 --> 04:22.422
What are you and Bubblegum up to?

04:22.445 --> 04:23.680
Is everything alright?

04:23.711 --> 04:25.015
Yep! Fine!

04:25.031 --> 04:27.039
Everything is great! Heh, heh.

04:27.062 --> 04:28.140
Except for that...

04:28.148 --> 04:28.875
...Whoa!

04:29.164 --> 04:30.806
I didn't know he was chocolate.

04:31.477 --> 04:33.837
Jake, truth or dare?

04:33.914 --> 04:34.470
Truth.

04:34.547 --> 04:37.336
Do you prefer chocolate or fudge?

04:37.383 --> 04:39.523
I can't eat chocolate or fudge
'cause I'm a dog

04:39.531 --> 04:41.594
and they'd probably kill me, but...

04:41.742 --> 04:44.304
...probably...

04:44.336 --> 04:45.226
...neither.

04:45.335 --> 04:46.461
Finn! Truth or dare?

04:46.554 --> 04:47.633
Dare!

04:47.741 --> 04:50.562
I dare you...

04:50.577 --> 04:53.695
...to tell me the truth about
what's going on in your mind.

04:53.757 --> 04:56.616
What were you and Bubblegum talking
about when you were alone together?

05:01.038 --> 05:03.670
The truth is...

05:03.702 --> 05:06.873
You promised you wouldn't
freakin' tell anyone!

05:06.889 --> 05:08.796
Oh, you're so cute, Finn!

05:09.694 --> 05:11.100
The truth is...

05:11.201 --> 05:12.654
...that I'd rather play Dodge Socks!

05:14.139 --> 05:17.693
I'm not playing dodge socks 'til you
stop dodging my questions.

05:17.834 --> 05:18.459
Hey...

05:19.443 --> 05:20.842
Old Mr. Cream Puff?

05:20.959 --> 05:22.216
Isn't he dead?

05:22.240 --> 05:24.998
Hey, give me my sock back!
Dodge Socks was a bad idea!

05:25.021 --> 05:25.670
Whoa!

05:25.693 --> 05:27.826
Look dude, just tell me what's up,

05:27.852 --> 05:31.028
'cause you are crazier than
a cannonball tonight.

05:31.060 --> 05:31.693
Oh, my goodness!

05:31.719 --> 05:34.528
Princess hasn't finished the equation
and the zombies are here!

05:34.552 --> 05:36.029
I...

05:36.052 --> 05:38.466
...she wants this slumber party
to be super fun!

05:38.497 --> 05:40.013
And if I did have something to tell you

05:40.029 --> 05:40.630
then I would

05:40.656 --> 05:41.263
in a second

05:41.289 --> 05:42.685
and it would make my life easier

05:42.717 --> 05:44.177
unless there was something stopping me

05:44.193 --> 05:44.826
like a promise,

05:44.849 --> 05:45.451
but there isn't!

05:45.474 --> 05:46.576
So I won't, so it's cool.

05:46.595 --> 05:47.931
Sugar!

05:47.959 --> 05:49.599
What? You lost me.

05:50.303 --> 05:52.326
Hey, you know what time it is?

05:52.357 --> 05:53.389
Adventure Time?

05:53.419 --> 05:55.857
No, time for Seven Minutes in Heaven!

05:55.897 --> 05:56.576
You're first.

05:56.592 --> 05:57.131
Really?

05:57.280 --> 05:59.545
Lady Rainicorn! In the closet with Jake!

05:59.560 --> 06:00.537
뭐? 나?
("What? Me?")

06:00.563 --> 06:02.290
웃겨 정말.
("You gotta be kidding me.")

06:02.316 --> 06:03.287
그래, 좋아. 하자.
("Okay, then. I'll play.")

06:03.303 --> 06:04.944
Okay, okay, alright.

06:04.968 --> 06:09.007
But in seven minutes, I'm gonna come out
there and make you spill your beans, Finn.

06:09.038 --> 06:12.093
I can't hear you all the way in heaven!

06:12.304 --> 06:13.202
SUGAR!

06:18.214 --> 06:20.065
Umm, does anyone else hear that?

06:20.144 --> 06:21.651
What? Hear what?

06:21.675 --> 06:22.894
I, I don't hear anything.

06:25.666 --> 06:27.636
I hear something I don't understand...

06:27.662 --> 06:29.137
And it makes me scared!

06:29.183 --> 06:29.761
What?

06:29.784 --> 06:31.495
No, Chet. Everybody, wait.

06:31.542 --> 06:32.378
What noise?

06:32.651 --> 06:34.831
You mean <i>this</i> noise?

06:38.198 --> 06:40.370
Yeah! Dance it! Bust it up!

06:44.987 --> 06:48.112
What is this game
you are playing right now, Finn?

06:49.940 --> 06:51.690
Uhh, it's... Blockado.

06:52.198 --> 06:53.128
Haha, the game of barricades.

06:53.154 --> 06:55.207
Come on, let's block all the
entrances and windows!

06:59.346 --> 07:01.369
Alright, this is not
a permanent solution.

07:01.893 --> 07:04.549
Think Finn, how can you keep
everyone from finding out?

07:04.596 --> 07:06.471
Find out about what, Finn?

07:06.502 --> 07:07.182
Manfried!

07:07.244 --> 07:08.572
The talking piñata!

07:08.619 --> 07:11.424
Your convinient appearance
gives me a great idea.

07:11.463 --> 07:13.127
Everybody, grab a stick!

07:13.166 --> 07:14.033
New game!

07:14.119 --> 07:15.838
We're gonna smash some piñatas!

07:15.900 --> 07:17.025
What?

07:17.111 --> 07:18.009
Except for you, Manfried.

07:18.072 --> 07:19.298
Oh, thank goodness.

07:19.572 --> 07:21.877
Now everybody don these blindfolds.

07:21.986 --> 07:22.838
Thanks, Taffy Girl.

07:24.017 --> 07:26.275
Alright, everybody, get together.

07:26.744 --> 07:28.205
I'm hanging the piñatas...

07:28.307 --> 07:29.955
They're all around you.

07:30.002 --> 07:31.415
Smash the piñatas!!!

07:37.347 --> 07:38.972
Yeah! You guys are on fire!

07:42.830 --> 07:44.026
Hmmm, it's so delicious.

07:44.418 --> 07:46.277
We did it!

07:46.582 --> 07:48.136
My improbable plan worked!

07:48.887 --> 07:49.613
안녕!
("Hello!")

07:49.628 --> 07:50.675
Seven minutes up yet?

07:54.363 --> 07:56.050
What the nuts happened here?!?

07:56.136 --> 07:59.285
Oh, we killed all the zombies that Princess
Bubblegum and I raised from the dead.

07:59.300 --> 07:59.730
Really?!?

08:00.785 --> 08:01.848
Jake?

08:01.874 --> 08:03.052
What's going on?

08:03.749 --> 08:04.210
What?

08:04.968 --> 08:07.592
Finn! Did you break your
<i>Royal Promise</i> ?

08:07.741 --> 08:08.499
Yeah, but...

08:08.515 --> 08:10.632
...I mean, all the zombies are dead.

08:10.648 --> 08:12.265
The Candy People won't freak out.

08:12.281 --> 08:13.163
What's the big deal?

08:13.179 --> 08:15.242
This is really, really bad, Finn.

08:15.350 --> 08:17.585
You can't break <i>Royal Promises</i>.

08:17.609 --> 08:20.218
Never, ever, never.
No matter what, forever.

08:21.764 --> 08:24.350
The Guardians of the Royal Promise
are coming for us.

08:28.421 --> 08:29.585
Finn the Human.

08:29.611 --> 08:32.250
You have broken a <i>Royal Promise</i>

08:32.522 --> 08:34.304
for which the penalty is...

08:34.330 --> 08:35.937
...trial by fire.

08:37.366 --> 08:38.225
That's stupid.

08:38.249 --> 08:39.054
Wait!

08:39.078 --> 08:42.453
He's my friend!
Isn't there another option?!

08:42.515 --> 08:46.016
Yes. Because you care for
the promise-breaker,

08:46.030 --> 08:48.602
we will give him a less hot trial.

08:48.907 --> 08:51.516
You must now answer...

08:51.579 --> 08:53.884
...Math questions!

08:53.899 --> 08:55.204
Mathematical!!!

08:55.235 --> 08:57.360
Finn, you're terrible at math.

08:58.040 --> 08:58.969
Now...

08:59.891 --> 09:01.680
...solve <i>this</i>!

09:07.300 --> 09:09.683
Oh Wait, wait,

09:09.863 --> 09:11.941
I thought of a better one.

09:13.316 --> 09:14.433
2 + 2

09:14.504 --> 09:16.160
Solve it or die.

09:16.348 --> 09:17.043
Uhh...

09:17.504 --> 09:19.293
4, right?

09:22.582 --> 09:23.645
Oh, correct.

09:27.215 --> 09:28.503
What's happening, Princess?

09:28.519 --> 09:30.900
You've defeated the
broken royal promise!

09:30.908 --> 09:32.918
The Gumball Guardians
are resetting!

09:36.792 --> 09:37.878
Slamacow!

09:37.964 --> 09:39.167
That was tops!

09:39.285 --> 09:40.730
Who's not good at math?

09:40.933 --> 09:42.441
I was all "Four!"!

09:42.534 --> 09:44.144
Four... Four, four, four...

09:44.261 --> 09:45.417
That's it!

09:45.456 --> 09:47.042
The answer was so simple...

09:47.058 --> 09:48.894
...I was too smart to see it!

09:49.175 --> 09:50.292
You're welcome!

09:50.363 --> 09:52.118
'4' is the last figure I need

09:52.142 --> 09:54.681
to perfect my decorpsinator serum!

09:57.735 --> 09:58.697
Golly!

10:03.004 --> 10:05.144
This is messed up, but sweet.

10:05.261 --> 10:06.152
진짜로.
("Truly it is.")

10:07.472 --> 10:08.558
Uncle Chewy!

10:08.816 --> 10:09.879
Grandma!

10:10.035 --> 10:11.292
All of my dead relatives!

10:11.347 --> 10:12.730
Starchy!

10:12.769 --> 10:13.417
Mornin'.

10:13.449 --> 10:16.339
Man, you broke a <i>Royal Promise</i> ?!?

10:16.371 --> 10:17.457
You're nuts.

10:17.496 --> 10:20.277
All you had to do is say that
it was a royal secret.

10:20.488 --> 10:21.488
I know what's up.

10:21.566 --> 10:25.394
I hope you grasp the full consequences
of breaking promises.

10:25.433 --> 10:26.293
Heck yeah!

10:26.362 --> 10:27.964
If I break a <i>Royal Promise</i>,

10:27.996 --> 10:29.386
I get to fight zombies,

10:29.410 --> 10:30.519
throw slumber parties,

10:30.543 --> 10:32.394
awake Gumball Guardians and...and...

10:32.426 --> 10:33.668
Alright, alright.

10:33.707 --> 10:35.887
...and reverse <i>Death</i> itself!

10:35.941 --> 10:37.348
Oh, you are adorable.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.207
But keep your promises, okay?

10:39.230 --> 10:40.512
I will, Princess.

10:42.714 --> 10:44.886
Starchy, you're <i>not</i> a zombie.

10:44.910 --> 10:47.082
I can't help it. Flesh is delicious!

10:47.105 --> 10:48.066
<i>You're</i> delicious!

10:48.898 --> 10:50.351
Don't squeeze me! I'll fart!
