WEBVTT

00:04.308 --> 00:07.833
- We've treated multiple cases
of necrotizing fasciitis.

00:07.877 --> 00:09.270
- That's flesh-eating bacteria.

00:10.575 --> 00:12.621
- I've called the CDC.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.710
- I have never seen anything
like this.

00:14.753 --> 00:17.321
We need something
that works stronger and faster.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.671
- All of our victims have come
from one of two places,

00:19.715 --> 00:22.544
the CCU lab
or this apartment building.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.676
- I think someone
may be spreading this.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.374
This is no outbreak.

00:26.417 --> 00:28.202
It's an act of terrorism.

00:28.245 --> 00:30.073
- We're gonna nail
this son of a bitch

00:30.117 --> 00:31.640
before he infects more people.

00:31.683 --> 00:32.815
- I know this guy.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.599
He works at the CCU lab.

00:36.340 --> 00:37.602
- What're you doing?

00:44.740 --> 00:46.263
- Will's not picking up.

00:46.307 --> 00:48.135
- Almost there.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.226
- Whoa.

00:53.227 --> 00:54.184
Whoa.

01:01.148 --> 01:03.367
- We're looking for Dr. Seldon.
He's with my brother.

01:03.411 --> 01:04.803
- The lab, second floor.
D wing.

01:04.847 --> 01:06.588
- All right.
- Stairs will be faster.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.640
- Hey!
Hey!

01:19.209 --> 01:20.776
- Man down!
- Get away from there!

01:20.819 --> 01:22.865
- What are you doing?

01:22.908 --> 01:24.301
- Hey!

01:24.345 --> 01:26.521
- Get out of my way.
Police, move.

01:26.564 --> 01:27.739
- Will?

01:27.783 --> 01:29.219
Will!
What happened?

01:29.263 --> 01:30.655
- I'm fine.

01:30.699 --> 01:32.875
Dr. Seldon.
Damn it!

01:32.918 --> 01:34.224
He knocked the hell out of me.

01:34.268 --> 01:35.486
- Where is he?

01:35.530 --> 01:37.749
- What happened?
- He sabotaged our work.

01:37.793 --> 01:39.795
- Who?
- David Seldon.

01:39.838 --> 01:41.840
- No, David Seldon, he was
helping us with the treatment.

01:41.884 --> 01:42.928
- He cold-cocked me
over the head.

01:42.972 --> 01:45.235
- Oh, God.
- How long were you out?

01:45.279 --> 01:46.497
- I don't know--
couldn't have been long,

01:46.541 --> 01:47.803
he might still be
in the hospital.

01:47.846 --> 01:48.891
- Jay, go, go.
- You gonna be okay?

01:48.934 --> 01:50.414
- Yeah.
- Listen, you got this?

01:50.458 --> 01:51.589
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, here.
- Okay.

01:51.633 --> 01:52.721
- Let me see.

01:52.764 --> 01:54.853
- Is it bad?
- You've looked better.

01:54.897 --> 01:56.638
Thanks.

01:57.813 --> 01:59.336
- Hey, relax!

01:59.380 --> 02:00.816
- This place is the source
of the outbreak!

02:00.859 --> 02:03.210
- Yeah!
- And nobody's doing anything!

02:03.253 --> 02:05.864
- None of that is true!
Now, back the hell up!

02:05.908 --> 02:09.259
- It's all over the Internet!
The outbreak started here.

02:09.303 --> 02:11.174
You're arresting
the wrong people!

02:11.218 --> 02:13.176
- Back up.
Back--

02:13.220 --> 02:15.309
Enough.
Enough!

02:15.352 --> 02:16.614
What are you thinking?

02:16.658 --> 02:17.615
- 5021 George,
I need a perimeter

02:17.659 --> 02:19.269
set up at Chicago Med.

02:19.313 --> 02:20.531
My sergeant's coming,
he's gotta talk to you.

02:20.575 --> 02:21.967
Offender is male,
white, 40s,

02:22.011 --> 02:23.447
should be considered
armed and dangerous.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.406
May be in possession
of a deadly bacterial agent.

02:25.449 --> 02:26.668
We gotta cover all the exits.

02:26.711 --> 02:27.930
- All right, you got
a code for an offender

02:27.973 --> 02:29.627
in the building,
possibly armed?

02:29.671 --> 02:32.326
- That's a Code Silver.
- Activate it.

02:32.369 --> 02:34.545
I need access to your
security room on this floor.

02:34.589 --> 02:37.244
I need all footage--
the exits, the lots,

02:37.287 --> 02:39.637
and I need you to set up
a direct line of communication

02:39.681 --> 02:41.335
between me
and Sharon Goodwin.

02:41.378 --> 02:42.858
- Yes, sir.

02:47.645 --> 02:48.820
- Code Silver.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.300
- Code Silver?
That's--

02:50.344 --> 02:52.302
- That's an active security
threat in the hospital.

02:52.346 --> 02:53.434
- That means
they've ID'd the offender

02:53.477 --> 02:54.739
and believe he's still in here.

02:54.783 --> 02:57.177
- I'll text you as soon
as she's out of surgery.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.707
- Back up!
- I got her.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.665
I got her.
Medics?

03:07.709 --> 03:10.581
All right, Alma.
You're all right.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.279
- What's going on?

03:12.322 --> 03:14.890
- They think I did this.
- We know you didn't.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.500
I need you to breathe, just...

03:16.544 --> 03:19.503
focus on your breath, okay?
Just focus on your breath.

03:21.462 --> 03:23.290
- Hi, you're okay, Alma.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.682
We're just gonna give you
a little bit of oxygen

03:24.726 --> 03:26.031
for that breathing,

03:26.075 --> 03:27.598
but I really need you
to just calm down, okay?

03:27.642 --> 03:29.687
You're okay.
Everything's gonna be fine.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.515
Got it.

03:31.559 --> 03:34.518
Deep breaths.
There you go, okay?

03:34.562 --> 03:35.563
- Here we go.

03:37.956 --> 03:41.351
- I feel like
this is getting away from us.

03:43.571 --> 03:44.963
- Yeah.

03:49.011 --> 03:51.535
- Okay, I've got two vehicles
registered to Seldon.

03:51.579 --> 03:55.887
a red 2014 Corolla,
license plate 136 4987,

03:55.931 --> 03:57.628
and a black 2019 Prius,

03:57.672 --> 03:59.978
license plate
2336 Eddie Lincoln.

04:01.415 --> 04:03.895
-  There, top left.
Black Prius.

04:03.939 --> 04:05.506
That's time-stamped
eight minutes ago.

04:05.549 --> 04:06.768
He could be anywhere.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.291
- 5021 Eddie,
requesting the air

04:08.335 --> 04:09.858
put out an immediate
Flash-Message.

04:09.901 --> 04:11.425
- All units
stay off the zone.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.296
5021 Eddie,
go with your Flash.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.385
- Be on the lookout
for a black 2019 Prius,

04:15.429 --> 04:16.473
Illinois tags,
last seen

04:16.517 --> 04:18.040
fleeing Chicago Med
eight minutes ago.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.390
Driver's wanted
on multiple homicides.

04:20.434 --> 04:21.696
- Patrol rounded up all but two

04:21.739 --> 04:23.611
of the quarantine jailbreaks
from Med.

04:23.654 --> 04:25.917
We've got BOLOs out
on the last two.

04:25.961 --> 04:29.660
We broke up a mob action
near 445 North Racine with CFD.

04:29.704 --> 04:31.053
- Yeah.

04:31.096 --> 04:32.881
- Bunch of conspiracy
theory morons tossed

04:32.924 --> 04:34.970
a Molotov cocktail through
Mama Garcia's front window.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.580
- Yeah, I know.

04:36.624 --> 04:38.713
- CFD is just as swamped
with calls as we are.

04:38.756 --> 04:40.454
You need to pass these around.

04:40.497 --> 04:41.933
City's in a panic.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.587
- You putting more boots
on the ground?

04:43.631 --> 04:45.720
- Yeah, but I'm keeping
a reserve.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.983
When you need a Tact team,
they'll be ready.

04:48.026 --> 04:49.376
- Appreciate it.

04:51.552 --> 04:55.599
- All right.
Everyone, listen up.

04:57.079 --> 04:59.734
The entire police department
is officially

04:59.777 --> 05:01.997
in a manhunt situation.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.347
The identified offender's
description,

05:04.391 --> 05:06.741
what we know about him,
his picture, is in your email.

05:06.784 --> 05:09.874
We are gonna answer calls
as we always do,

05:09.918 --> 05:11.615
but if you locate
this offender,

05:11.659 --> 05:13.965
you radio
and hold your position.

05:14.009 --> 05:16.794
You do not approach.
Is that clear?

05:16.838 --> 05:18.361
all: Yes.

05:18.405 --> 05:19.754
- Stay safe!

05:23.497 --> 05:25.542
- Tell me we got
something solid.

05:25.586 --> 05:27.414
- CPIC hit on Seldon's Prius,

05:27.457 --> 05:29.067
Canal and Madison
16 minutes ago.

05:29.111 --> 05:30.982
- Followed him on cams
into a parking structure

05:31.026 --> 05:32.419
connected to Ogilvie Station.

05:32.462 --> 05:33.724
- 12-tact is sitting
on the car.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.465
They did a covert walk-by.
It's empty.

05:35.509 --> 05:37.641
- He buy a train ticket?
- No confirmation of that.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.774
UCs are flooding
the station right now.

05:39.817 --> 05:40.949
No tellers ID'd him.

05:40.992 --> 05:43.125
We got Amtrak security
checking the cars,

05:43.168 --> 05:44.605
holding the trains,
just in case.

05:44.648 --> 05:47.477
- Now, listen,
we don't assume anything.

05:47.521 --> 05:48.957
Seldon could be
heading out of town.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.959
He could be hiding.
We follow both.

05:51.002 --> 05:52.439
- The transportation teams
are up to speed--

05:52.482 --> 05:53.875
Amtrak, CTA, Metra,
they're all aware.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.485
- State police
for the highways,

05:55.529 --> 05:57.705
airport police
for O'Hare and Midway.

05:57.748 --> 06:00.882
- So... what do we know
about this guy?

06:00.925 --> 06:02.971
- This is Dr. David Seldon.

06:03.014 --> 06:06.496
He's 47, undergrad
from Emory College in '92

06:06.540 --> 06:08.498
with a degree in Chemistry,
Master's in the same

06:08.542 --> 06:10.065
and a Doctorate,
also in Chemistry.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.676
- Married?
- Divorced, recently.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.026
Papers signed for months ago.
He moved out of his house.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.854
No LKA.
No children.

06:16.898 --> 06:18.943
- Guy's been in education
and research

06:18.987 --> 06:21.381
his entire career,
mostly infectious diseases.

06:22.207 --> 06:23.818
He's got no criminal record,
I mean,

06:23.861 --> 06:25.515
not even a parking ticket,

06:25.559 --> 06:27.604
and zero pops of associates
with criminal background.

06:27.648 --> 06:30.999
Up until today, this guy
has been an upstanding citizen.

06:33.567 --> 06:34.959
- All right, well,
we've been here before.

06:35.003 --> 06:36.700
We know how this goes.

06:36.744 --> 06:40.487
I want everything on Seldon.
Every single detail.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.140
Every single connection
to the victims.

06:42.184 --> 06:43.838
Anything that can
find us a motive.

06:43.881 --> 06:45.709
And we hit everyone.

06:45.753 --> 06:47.711
Anyone he knows,
any property he could go to.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.713
Jay, start with the ex-wife.

06:49.757 --> 06:51.454
Let's find him fast.

06:53.108 --> 06:54.675
- All right, we're starting
back at square one,

06:54.718 --> 06:55.980
but that doesn't mean we rush.

06:56.024 --> 06:57.460
Okay, mistakes happen
in a rush.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.506
We work quickly
and deliberately.

06:59.549 --> 07:00.507
Hi.
- Hey.

07:00.550 --> 07:01.986
Maybe not exactly square one.

07:02.030 --> 07:03.640
So Seldon destroyed
all of the samples,

07:03.684 --> 07:06.208
but we also tested for Vanc on
the microscopic slides, right?

07:06.251 --> 07:08.732
- You're right.
Excuse me.

07:13.302 --> 07:14.956
It's still here.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.784
- That's a small sample size.

07:16.827 --> 07:19.221
- So we need to be selective

07:19.264 --> 07:21.092
as we combine
additional antibiotics.

07:21.136 --> 07:23.617
We'll go by family.
Cephalosporin's next?

07:23.660 --> 07:24.922
- Yep.
- You got more stores on-site?

07:24.966 --> 07:26.228
- Not enough.

07:26.271 --> 07:27.925
But I'll talk to Goodwin
and we'll figure it out.

07:27.969 --> 07:29.797
- Okay.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.760
- Ladies and gentlemen,
we have blood flow.

07:36.804 --> 07:39.502
Amanda is gonna
get to keep her leg.

07:39.546 --> 07:42.505
Kid's gonna get to walk, dance,
do cartwheels in the grass.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.594
All right,
let's get her ready to close.

07:45.769 --> 07:47.945
April, you got
a plastic surgeon on standby?

07:47.989 --> 07:49.947
- Yep, Dr. Hayes
is happy to jump in.

07:49.991 --> 07:51.645
- Great... let's give this girl

07:51.688 --> 07:53.777
some good-looking scars
to boast about.

07:53.821 --> 07:56.606
She's gonna be bragging
about them at school.

07:56.650 --> 07:58.521
Let's make 'em badass.

07:59.566 --> 08:00.958
- BP's dropping.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.612
It's a quick drop.
80 over 50.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.309
- Okay, give her bolus.

08:04.353 --> 08:06.834
April, I'm gonna
close her up myself.

08:11.142 --> 08:12.796
- Pressure's still dropping,
70 over 40.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.668
- Damn it.
Push pressors.

08:18.193 --> 08:20.630
Come on, kid.
Stay with me.

08:21.979 --> 08:24.286
Stay with me.

08:27.681 --> 08:30.292
- Okay, yeah.
Thanks, Natalie.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.905
Amanda, the girl from Med,
went into shock during surgery.

08:34.949 --> 08:37.299
They stabilized her, but
she's in critical condition.

08:37.342 --> 08:39.693
14 years old,
alone at the hospital.

08:40.868 --> 08:43.653
- Hey, which one is he, guys?
- The one with the red car.

08:45.220 --> 08:46.787
- Any activity?

08:46.830 --> 08:48.092
- No one in or out
since we parked it here.

08:48.136 --> 08:49.833
It's been quiet
as a church mouse.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.269
The vehicle in the driveway
comes back registered

08:51.313 --> 08:52.749
to Carrie White Seldon.

08:52.793 --> 08:53.750
- That's the one. Thanks.
- Yeah.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.099
- You want us to back you up?

08:55.143 --> 08:56.318
- No, we're good.
Get back out there.

08:56.361 --> 08:57.972
- Copy that.

08:58.015 --> 08:59.060
- Hailey,
you got your ears on?

08:59.103 --> 09:00.670
- Yeah, go.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.324
- Digital dump
of all Seldon's devices

09:02.367 --> 09:04.674
showed last GPS ping on his
cell before he shut it off--

09:04.718 --> 09:06.197
it matches your location.

09:06.241 --> 09:08.765
Seldon may have visited
his ex-wife after fleeing Med.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.071
- Copy.

09:16.251 --> 09:17.774
- Jay.

09:23.084 --> 09:24.999
- Chicago PD!

09:53.680 --> 09:55.812
Upstairs is clear.

09:55.856 --> 09:57.335
- Stairs.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.911
They have a bunker?

10:14.396 --> 10:17.965
- You see this?
Looks like blood on the door.

10:34.198 --> 10:35.939
Chicago PD!

10:35.983 --> 10:38.289
Whoever's in there,
I need you to open this door

10:38.333 --> 10:40.335
and come out with your
hands up, nice and slow.

10:43.164 --> 10:44.818
- It's probably soundproof.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.996
- There's no way we're gonna
get into this thing on our own.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.577
- It's reinforced steel.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.188
- These things are made
to withstand fire,

11:07.231 --> 11:09.320
collapses,
any attempts to get inside.

11:09.364 --> 11:10.495
- We got cameras?

11:10.539 --> 11:11.801
- No, no cameras.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.542
And if there's any
communication wires,

11:13.585 --> 11:14.674
they're running
through the bottom.

11:14.717 --> 11:15.979
- You think Seldon
might be inside?

11:16.023 --> 11:17.372
- We got blood on the door,
so yeah.

11:17.415 --> 11:18.590
There's a good chance
he's in there.

11:18.634 --> 11:19.896
- Okay, we can open it,

11:19.940 --> 11:21.332
but it's not gonna be pretty.

11:23.378 --> 11:24.422
- Let's do it.

11:35.651 --> 11:37.827
- You sure that column's
gonna hold?

11:37.871 --> 11:39.524
- We're gonna find out.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.526
You guys ready?

11:41.570 --> 11:44.399
- Yeah, let's go.
- All right, Cruz, let's go.

12:08.031 --> 12:09.511
- Chicago PD, drop your weapon!

12:09.554 --> 12:11.774
- No Seldon, that's his wife.

12:11.818 --> 12:14.777
- Carrie, drop your weapon now!

12:14.821 --> 12:16.692
- Carrie!

12:16.736 --> 12:18.259
- No!
Please don't come near me!

12:18.302 --> 12:20.565
Please, I don't want to die!
Please stay away!

12:20.609 --> 12:21.828
- No one's gonna hurt you,
Carrie,

12:21.871 --> 12:22.959
but you need
to drop your weapon

12:23.003 --> 12:24.526
and come out
with your hands up!

12:24.569 --> 12:27.659
- I'm not coming out because--
because my ex-husband said

12:27.703 --> 12:30.575
that an infection has started--
an outbreak,

12:30.619 --> 12:32.752
and people are dying
and you could be infected.

12:32.795 --> 12:35.580
- Nobody out here is infected.
- Please don't come near me!

12:35.624 --> 12:36.886
- Ma'am, we're with
the Chicago Fire Department,

12:36.930 --> 12:38.409
we know what the outbreak
looks like.

12:38.453 --> 12:39.759
I promise you
we're not infected.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.499
- Don't come near me, I said!

12:41.543 --> 12:43.414
- You have to make contact
with the disease to get it.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.590
We won't touch you.
Just come out.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.593
- Carrie,
we don't want to hurt you,

12:48.637 --> 12:49.856
but if you don't come out,
we're gonna come in.

12:49.899 --> 12:53.903
- Put the weapon down!

12:53.947 --> 12:56.036
Put the gun down,
put your hands in the air,

12:56.079 --> 12:57.777
and walk towards me.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.040
Do it slow.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.955
Put it down!
- Okay!

13:03.870 --> 13:05.523
- Put your hands up.
Put your hands up!

13:05.567 --> 13:06.786
- Okay.
- Walk out here.

13:06.829 --> 13:09.049
Step towards me.
Step towards me.

13:09.092 --> 13:10.441
Keep coming.

13:10.485 --> 13:11.878
Put your hands
against the wall.

13:21.888 --> 13:24.629
- She's terrified.
She's shutting down.

13:24.673 --> 13:26.327
She says that Sheldon was here,

13:26.370 --> 13:27.850
he locked her
in the panic room, then left.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.634
She claims that she doesn't
know where he is

13:29.678 --> 13:31.593
and she's afraid to talk--she
doesn't want to implicate him.

13:31.636 --> 13:33.464
- I get it.
- Boss.

13:33.508 --> 13:35.466
That basement is insane.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.164
I mean, we're gonna inventory,

13:37.207 --> 13:39.906
but there's gotta be a decade's
worth of supplies down there.

13:39.949 --> 13:41.385
We're not gonna know
what's missing

13:41.429 --> 13:42.952
if we don't know what was there
in the first place.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.475
- Any tech?

13:44.519 --> 13:46.086
- Zero, nothing up or down.

13:46.129 --> 13:47.957
He didn't plan
the attacks here.

13:48.001 --> 13:50.481
- All right, so we'll
bring in the ex-wife.

13:50.525 --> 13:51.787
Make her talk.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.441
- All right.

13:53.484 --> 13:56.052
- Just got back
from Lakeshore Memorial.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.141
They're sending over
antibiotics.

13:58.185 --> 13:59.534
- All right,
we're back in business.

13:59.577 --> 14:01.014
I'll help Danover get prepared.

14:01.057 --> 14:03.364
- Uh, Dr. Halstead, did you
have someone check you out?

14:03.407 --> 14:05.148
- I'm okay.
We can't slow down.

14:05.192 --> 14:06.758
- Miss Goodwin?
- Yeah?

14:08.499 --> 14:09.936
- Okay, all right.
I'll be back, excuse me.

14:11.111 --> 14:13.678
Most of them are nothing--
dermatitis, eczema...

14:13.722 --> 14:15.942
people are just scared...
don't blame 'em.

14:15.985 --> 14:18.945
Worse than the Ebola virus
in New York.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.555
Ah, my patient.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.864
- Pushing epi now.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.604
- She's got an irregular rhythm,
she's in V-fib.

14:26.648 --> 14:27.736
- Here, let me take over.

14:30.565 --> 14:31.871
- Charged.
Clear.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.574
- No pulse.
- Another milligram of epi.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.752
- Come on.
Come on.

14:43.795 --> 14:45.101
- Clear.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.106
- Come on, Amanda.

14:52.979 --> 14:55.503
- Got a pulse--sinus rhythm.
Get her on a mask.

14:55.546 --> 14:57.592
- Okay, I want to know
why this keeps happening.

14:57.635 --> 14:59.899
- Seems like a post-surgical
reaction to the septic shock.

14:59.942 --> 15:02.510
- Could be, but I don't
wanna take any chances.

15:02.553 --> 15:04.904
I want fresh blood cultures
times two, repeat CBC,

15:04.947 --> 15:06.775
and get radiology to scan
her leg for any abscesses.

15:06.818 --> 15:09.038
- Let's give her everything
we've got--30 Levophed,

15:09.082 --> 15:11.127
four vasopressin,
and another liter of saline.

15:11.171 --> 15:13.564
- And add another pressor.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.436
I'm gonna check
on her myself every 20.

15:15.479 --> 15:16.916
- All right, I've got
to get back to quarantine.

15:16.959 --> 15:17.917
Keep me updated?

15:21.616 --> 15:23.966
- You're gonna be okay.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.012
- I just wanna see him,
to talk to him.

15:26.055 --> 15:29.537
- Ma'am, I need you
to answer my questions.

15:29.580 --> 15:31.452
- I am trying.

15:31.495 --> 15:35.021
I've told you everything
about my marriage.

15:35.064 --> 15:38.198
But he wouldn't do this, I--
he wouldn't, he wouldn't.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.852
- You and your ex-husband
built a panic room.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.506
Some of this must make sense.

15:42.550 --> 15:46.075
- For when an outbreak happened
but not for when he caused one.

15:46.119 --> 15:49.165
My ex-husband is not crazy,
he's not a monster,

15:49.209 --> 15:52.168
he--he just,
he dedicated his whole life

15:52.212 --> 15:54.910
to infectious diseases
and that's not--

15:54.954 --> 15:56.825
it's not paranoia,
it's--it's fear.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.653
It's educated
and grounded fear.

15:58.696 --> 16:01.134
And the right outbreak,
at the right time,

16:01.177 --> 16:03.179
with the right factors--
it could end this race

16:03.223 --> 16:04.876
within months,
and that is a truth

16:04.920 --> 16:06.966
that people can't
handle looking at,

16:07.009 --> 16:09.664
and he had to look at it
every single day.

16:09.707 --> 16:11.971
- All right, and we think your
ex-husband caused this, so...

16:12.014 --> 16:13.581
- Not--that's not possible.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.715
- Look at me.

16:17.759 --> 16:18.847
Look.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.068
Look.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.121
Look at me.

16:32.165 --> 16:34.254
Look at me!

16:34.297 --> 16:37.866
Your husband did this, okay?

16:37.909 --> 16:40.608
You fired at police officers.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.567
I will hold you,
I will charge you,

16:43.611 --> 16:45.569
I will make sure
you are incarcerated

16:45.613 --> 16:47.658
for a very long time.

16:47.702 --> 16:51.010
Now, I'm gonna ask you...

16:51.053 --> 16:52.750
did your husband tell you

16:52.794 --> 16:55.144
anything else before he left?

16:59.670 --> 17:00.628
Did he?

17:00.671 --> 17:03.239
- Yes, yes, he did.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.981
I asked him why he was leaving,

17:06.025 --> 17:08.679
and he said that he wasn't...

17:08.723 --> 17:10.638
he said
that he wasn't done yet,

17:10.681 --> 17:12.118
that he had more work to do.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.556
- Okay.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.560
Listen to me.

17:19.603 --> 17:22.954
I need a list of everything
your husband may have taken

17:22.998 --> 17:25.653
from your home
or from your storage.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.049
We gotta focus now.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.225
- Okay, okay.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.142
- A satellite phone,
$3,000 in cash,

17:36.185 --> 17:38.709
lots of chemistry equipment,
dishes, spray nozzles,

17:38.753 --> 17:40.276
canisters,
that sort of thing,

17:40.320 --> 17:43.105
and, uh, keys
to a 2002 black Ford pickup

17:43.149 --> 17:45.673
registered in Carrie's mother's
name parked in a lot downtown,

17:45.716 --> 17:47.109
which Upton is now checking on.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.329
Carrie said that their marriage
started to disintegrate

17:49.372 --> 17:51.200
after Seldon became
more and more distant...

17:51.244 --> 17:53.115
started feeling like
she was living with a ghost.

17:53.159 --> 17:56.118
- Carrie also stated
that Seldon told her

17:56.162 --> 17:58.338
he "wasn't done yet,"

17:58.381 --> 18:01.123
so we gotta assume he's
planning to hit another target.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.212
Where we at?
- Not that far, Sarge.

18:03.256 --> 18:05.084
We're working on a rough
timeline--we haven't been

18:05.127 --> 18:07.782
able to connect Seldon
to everything yet, but...

18:07.825 --> 18:09.697
- What we know--
he stole bacteria from

18:09.740 --> 18:11.916
the university lab,
broke safety protocols--

18:11.960 --> 18:13.918
CDC believes
that's how our victim,

18:13.962 --> 18:15.224
Veronica Song, got infected.

18:15.268 --> 18:16.878
- Right, then he infected
his coworker,

18:16.921 --> 18:18.140
Stuart Anderson, on purpose--

18:18.184 --> 18:20.055
spoofed his emails
and everything.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.404
- Yeah, then he goes
back to ground zero,

18:21.448 --> 18:22.927
the apartment building--
we still haven't been able

18:22.971 --> 18:24.668
to tie the building to Seldon,

18:24.712 --> 18:26.279
but we have been able
to tie victims

18:26.322 --> 18:27.976
two and three to the building.

18:28.019 --> 18:29.717
They were there
visiting friends recently.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.719
- From there,
he went back to the CCU labs,

18:31.762 --> 18:32.894
set the place on fire,

18:32.937 --> 18:34.374
then volunteered
to help the CDC

18:34.417 --> 18:35.679
so he could sabotage
their research.

18:35.723 --> 18:36.941
- I had a buddy

18:36.985 --> 18:38.639
in Army Intelligence track
Seldon's sat phone.

18:38.682 --> 18:41.207
It's at a gas station
right now, 4583 North Racine.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.208
Upton's en route.

18:42.251 --> 18:43.296
- Let's go.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.258
- Intelligence, roll with me.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.391
Phone's pinging
in that gas station.

18:51.434 --> 18:53.001
Keep eyes as we clear.

18:57.832 --> 18:59.660
Chicago PD,
stay down, stay down.

18:59.703 --> 19:02.228
Get in your vehicle, sir.
Get in your vehicle.

19:02.271 --> 19:03.664
- Let me see your hands.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.972
- Get down.
Get down, stay down.

19:08.016 --> 19:09.974
- Hands up!
I need your hands up.

19:10.018 --> 19:11.280
Turn to face me!

19:11.324 --> 19:13.978
You're good.

19:14.022 --> 19:16.981
- Tucker, check inside.
We got the truck.

19:17.025 --> 19:18.461
- All right, move, move.

19:20.463 --> 19:23.988
- Hold, hold, hold.
Let's see your hands!

19:24.032 --> 19:25.816
Get your hands up!

19:25.860 --> 19:27.731
- Hands.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.214
Is it him?

19:32.258 --> 19:34.303
- Sorry, ma'am.
No, move.

19:34.347 --> 19:37.437
- Clear.
- Detective, straight ahead!

19:38.742 --> 19:41.180
- Tucker, 12:00.

19:41.223 --> 19:44.357
A man got inside.
It could be him.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.708
- Did you make a positive ID?
- I don't know.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.188
He was holding something
in his hand.

19:50.885 --> 19:52.191
Stay down.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.844
- I need you
to shut the vehicle off

19:53.888 --> 19:56.325
and get your hands out
of the window.

19:56.369 --> 19:57.979
Get down.

19:58.022 --> 19:59.807
- He had something--
a canister, maybe.

19:59.850 --> 20:03.114
- Hands up!
Shut the vehicle off now!

20:03.158 --> 20:05.334
- He can infect everyone here.
- Calm.

20:05.378 --> 20:08.946
- Police!
- Vehicle off, hands out, now!

20:08.990 --> 20:10.383
- Hands up!

20:10.426 --> 20:11.993
- That's not the same make
of vehicle.

20:12.036 --> 20:14.474
- No, I saw him.
I saw him, he had something.

20:18.521 --> 20:20.871
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!

20:20.915 --> 20:23.483
- Hold!
- Hands up!

20:24.919 --> 20:27.530
Get your hands up!

20:27.574 --> 20:28.836
Get out of the car!

20:30.403 --> 20:31.926
We're good.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.451
- It's just a can of pop.

20:37.366 --> 20:38.498
- You all right?

20:40.108 --> 20:42.241
Lower your weapon.
Lower your weapon.

20:42.284 --> 20:44.547
Look at me.
Give me your gun.

20:44.591 --> 20:46.941
Give me your gun.

20:47.942 --> 20:49.422
Let's go.
Walk away.

20:54.731 --> 20:56.646
- Sat phone was in
the bed of the truck.

20:56.690 --> 20:57.821
Seldon left it there
deliberately.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.040
Driver didn't speak English,
moved fast.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.824
- Hey, how you doing?

21:02.086 --> 21:04.567
All right, Detective Upton,
she's gonna stay with you.

21:04.611 --> 21:07.744
I don't want you talking
to anybody till IRT gets here.

21:07.788 --> 21:10.399
Just walk with her--
away from everyone.

21:11.879 --> 21:14.098
- Station's clear.
No sign of Seldon.

21:14.142 --> 21:16.710
- Sarge, two of Seldon's
credit cards just popped up,

21:16.753 --> 21:18.755
both of them way across town
from each other.

21:18.799 --> 21:21.018
- So he's playing with us.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.415
- Okay, thanks.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.025
Two more of Seldon's
credit cards popped up.

21:28.069 --> 21:29.940
One in Logan Square,
one in Pilsen.

21:29.984 --> 21:31.638
Patrol said the one
in Logan Square was used by

21:31.681 --> 21:33.466
a homeless man in a 7-Eleven.

21:33.509 --> 21:35.381
- Yeah, this cell phone
ping for Seldon is bogus.

21:35.424 --> 21:36.904
He threw it
in the back of a taxi.

21:36.947 --> 21:38.340
- Rojas is saying
the same goes with the Uber

21:38.384 --> 21:39.820
booked online--no one showed.

21:39.863 --> 21:42.344
- Sarge, we located
the black 2002 Ford pickup.

21:42.388 --> 21:43.867
The plates match.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.608
Tact team is sitting on it,
but nobody's in it.

21:45.652 --> 21:46.957
- Sarge, we got too many leads.

21:49.090 --> 21:52.006
- All right, enough.
Just put the phones down.

21:52.049 --> 21:54.487
Put 'em down.
Kim, put it down.

21:56.053 --> 21:58.360
We are not gonna be led
on a wild goose chase,

21:58.404 --> 22:00.971
and we are not gonna
be led into a panic.

22:01.015 --> 22:02.843
Look, he's buying time.

22:04.671 --> 22:06.020
We gotta get ahead of him now.

22:06.063 --> 22:07.935
- Well, patrol will stay
in the present.

22:07.978 --> 22:10.067
We'll hit every alert,
every tip,

22:10.111 --> 22:12.156
every sighting
like it's the real thing.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.638
We'll loop in CPIC to work
footage, before and after.

22:15.682 --> 22:17.510
- Well, there's still
a hell of a lot we don't know.

22:18.989 --> 22:22.558
So we're gonna get ahead
by moving backwards.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.821
I want a full timeline
of Seldon's life

22:24.865 --> 22:27.346
for the past six months,
month by month.

22:28.564 --> 22:30.827
Let's go.

22:33.047 --> 22:34.309
- You want to hit
the university?

22:34.353 --> 22:35.702
- Yeah, you know what,
I'm gonna meet you there.

22:35.745 --> 22:37.356
- Okay.

22:40.010 --> 22:41.925
- Hey, nothing's changed
since I called,

22:41.969 --> 22:44.101
but that's not
a bad thing, you know?

22:44.145 --> 22:45.799
It's just a waiting game
at this point.

22:45.842 --> 22:47.583
All right, she's young,
and she's strong.

22:47.627 --> 22:49.063
We gotta believe
her body's gonna fight back.

22:49.106 --> 22:51.108
- Yeah, I just didn't want
her to be alone if...

22:51.152 --> 22:52.675
- I know.

22:52.719 --> 22:54.198
- Is there still
no family found?

22:54.242 --> 22:56.200
- Uh, no, I got patrol
looking into it,

22:56.244 --> 22:57.854
but the whole department's
in overdrive.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.552
- We still haven't
been back to the station.

22:59.595 --> 23:01.031
It's just call after call.

23:01.075 --> 23:03.556
I've spent the last
24 hours telling people

23:03.599 --> 23:04.774
everything's gonna be okay

23:04.818 --> 23:07.908
when I'm not sure
I believe that myself.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.258
- In it together?
All right.

23:10.301 --> 23:12.434
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll keep checking on her.

23:12.478 --> 23:13.653
- Okay.

23:14.828 --> 23:16.525
- I'll check in with CPS.

23:16.569 --> 23:18.048
They're good with
tracking family, they'll help.

23:18.092 --> 23:19.528
- Okay, thank you.

23:19.572 --> 23:20.790
I'll keep trying
to find this guy.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.096
Hey.

23:22.139 --> 23:23.663
- Hailey,
we got a hit on Seldon.

23:23.706 --> 23:25.099
Three weeks ago,
a coworker of his

23:25.142 --> 23:27.014
saw him leaving
some work lofts on Ashland.

23:27.057 --> 23:28.842
We confirmed with them
that he's been paying cash

23:28.885 --> 23:30.104
for a loft for the last month.

23:30.147 --> 23:31.192
- I'm on my way.

23:31.235 --> 23:34.500
- We move coordinated
and quick.

23:34.543 --> 23:36.893
ID, then subdue.

23:36.937 --> 23:40.157
This target
is believed to be armed.

23:40.201 --> 23:43.726
The target is also believed
to be in possession

23:43.770 --> 23:47.077
of a weaponized bacteria
that can be fatal.

23:47.121 --> 23:50.080
If you believe you're in
the presence of this bacterium,

23:50.124 --> 23:53.780
you avoid contact,
keep a safe distance,

23:53.823 --> 23:57.479
beads locked,
but do not approach.

23:58.567 --> 23:59.525
Understood?

24:01.178 --> 24:03.442
All right, let's move.

24:16.977 --> 24:17.978
- Sarge.

24:25.594 --> 24:28.641
- Oh, my God.
Boss.

24:30.817 --> 24:33.167
That's right in the middle
of today's parade route.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.779
- All right,
have CDC transport

24:36.823 --> 24:38.694
all of that to Med right away.

24:38.738 --> 24:39.521
Jay, you and me.

24:42.176 --> 24:43.830
- Sorenstein...
this is Hank Voight,

24:43.873 --> 24:46.049
Chicago PD Intelligence unit.

24:46.093 --> 24:48.312
I need you to shut down
the parade right now.

24:48.356 --> 24:49.923
Get everyone off that route.

24:49.966 --> 24:52.491
- Yeah, that's not
gonna be a problem.

25:16.253 --> 25:18.125
- What the hell?

25:48.764 --> 25:53.334
- Never seen anything like it,
all my years on the job.

25:53.377 --> 25:55.075
- Good thing about
a terrified city--

25:55.118 --> 25:57.120
there was no one was here
for Seldon to infect.

25:57.164 --> 25:58.644
- Yeah, if this actually
was the target,

25:58.687 --> 26:00.515
not just another diversion.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.604
- The man wants
this city in a panic.

26:02.648 --> 26:05.694
Now the first responders.
Keep us all occupied.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.350
For what?

26:09.393 --> 26:11.482
- We don't know yet.

26:11.526 --> 26:13.441
But if he's buying time,

26:13.484 --> 26:15.835
that means we still have time
to get ahead of him.

26:15.878 --> 26:19.403
- Engine 51, Squad 3,
Ambo 61, structure fire,

26:19.447 --> 26:20.448
reports of looting.

26:20.491 --> 26:22.276
1340 Hazel Avenue.

26:23.582 --> 26:27.673
- Listen, we keep steady,
we keep working our timeline.

26:27.716 --> 26:29.675
All we need
is to find his "why."

26:29.718 --> 26:31.459
That'll get us to his "where."

26:36.290 --> 26:39.772
- All right, mm-hmm.
Thanks, Jay.

26:39.815 --> 26:42.296
All right, Halstead's
got another for June.

26:42.339 --> 26:43.689
- Okay.

26:43.732 --> 26:45.168
- Neighbors report
a drastic change in behavior,

26:45.212 --> 26:47.431
say Seldon was quick to anger,
quick to blame.

26:47.475 --> 26:49.651
Apparently he got into
a shouting match with one

26:49.695 --> 26:52.219
of his neighbors because their
dog walked across his lawn.

26:52.262 --> 26:54.351
Sounds like they almost
came to blows.

26:54.395 --> 26:55.701
- Well, that fits
with Carrie's timeline

26:55.744 --> 26:56.789
of their marriage ending.

26:56.832 --> 26:58.747
She filed for divorce
June 26th.

26:58.791 --> 27:00.923
- And there's his finances,
I mean, those statements show

27:00.967 --> 27:02.838
the big spending spike in June.

27:02.882 --> 27:04.927
He started buying more
supplies, different supplies.

27:04.971 --> 27:08.539
- Right, and then he rents
the work loft June 28th.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.759
- I mean,
June's gotta be the break.

27:10.803 --> 27:12.456
- Got something
from the university.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.415
Two coworkers claim
Seldon started bitching

27:14.458 --> 27:16.330
about science versus profit.

27:16.373 --> 27:17.766
Not really anything new,

27:17.810 --> 27:19.899
but they said he started
taking it personally,

27:19.942 --> 27:21.770
that his research
wouldn't see the light of day.

27:21.814 --> 27:23.816
Because of greed,
that people would die.

27:25.339 --> 27:26.775
The first conversation
they could remember

27:26.819 --> 27:28.647
is, uh, early June.

27:28.690 --> 27:29.952
- That's it.
That's what we're missing.

27:29.996 --> 27:32.346
That's gotta be the trigger.

27:33.434 --> 27:34.783
Sarge?
- Yeah?

27:34.827 --> 27:36.437
- We found Seldon's funding
was drastically cut

27:36.480 --> 27:38.221
for the coming year.
- Okay.

27:38.265 --> 27:39.353
- Funding was provided
by a place called

27:39.396 --> 27:40.963
BRT Health Industries.

27:41.007 --> 27:42.399
- Okay, BRT,
that's what Anderson

27:42.443 --> 27:43.792
was saying at the tailgate.

27:43.836 --> 27:45.228
- That's right,
his funding was denied in June,

27:45.272 --> 27:46.490
and that's when
he started planning.

27:46.534 --> 27:48.275
- BRT industries
is the link between

27:48.318 --> 27:50.364
the apartment building
and Seldon.

27:50.407 --> 27:52.366
Lynn Messick in apartment 12,

27:52.409 --> 27:54.455
she worked
for a consulting firm

27:54.498 --> 27:56.109
that rehabbed BRT's budget

27:56.152 --> 27:58.677
right before the decision was
made to pull Seldon's funding.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.722
- Sarge, it all fits.

28:00.766 --> 28:02.550
Seldon believed
he was researching a disease

28:02.593 --> 28:03.986
that could kill the planet,

28:04.030 --> 28:06.510
thought funding was needed
to create a treatment.

28:06.554 --> 28:08.556
He was denied,
the man snapped,

28:08.599 --> 28:10.384
and then he started
trying to prove it

28:10.427 --> 28:11.646
to all these people
who didn't believe him.

28:11.690 --> 28:12.952
- BRT Health Industries

28:12.995 --> 28:14.736
owns a building
on the far West Side.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.738
Boss, they're having
an annual board meeting today.

28:16.782 --> 28:18.522
Six board members
flew in this morning.

28:18.566 --> 28:20.350
- Oh, my God, that's it.
That's what he's waiting for.

28:20.394 --> 28:21.700
He's gonna hit the building.

28:21.743 --> 28:23.963
- I'll get every patrol member
I can spare.

28:24.006 --> 28:25.791
Tact team will be en route
in two.

28:25.834 --> 28:26.966
- Loop in the rest of the team.

28:27.009 --> 28:28.707
Whoever's there first
moves in first.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.839
Rojas, inform Med ASAP.

28:30.883 --> 28:32.711
They got a treatment,
stores of it

28:32.754 --> 28:34.016
should meet us there on-site.

28:34.060 --> 28:35.801
Get on the horn with Fire.

28:35.844 --> 28:38.368
We're gonna need help
evacuating that building.

28:41.284 --> 28:44.723
- All I want is a nice,
long bath and a vat of Purell.

28:47.073 --> 28:50.380
- Engine 51, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61,

28:50.424 --> 28:52.252
evacuation assistance,
2600 Roosevelt.

28:52.295 --> 28:53.862
- We just heard from CPD.
This is them--they think

28:53.906 --> 28:56.386
Dr. Seldon's hitting the BRT
building from the West Side.

28:56.430 --> 28:58.432
- All right, you heard her!
Let's move, move, move!

28:58.475 --> 29:00.303
This is it!
Let's end this!

29:03.393 --> 29:05.569
- I hear you and we are
making progress with what

29:05.613 --> 29:07.571
Seldon left behind in
the work loft, but I'm sorry.

29:07.615 --> 29:09.008
You just gotta give us
some more time.

29:09.051 --> 29:11.880
- Hey, we might have something.
- Hold on a sec.

29:11.924 --> 29:13.795
- Combination
of ampicillin-sulbactam,

29:13.839 --> 29:14.970
ticarcillin/clavulanic acid,

29:15.014 --> 29:16.493
and fourth-generation
cephalosporins.

29:16.537 --> 29:17.930
Heather?

29:17.973 --> 29:20.367
- This culture started
with 70 percent e-87 staph.

29:20.410 --> 29:23.457
Then I dosed it with
the new antibiotic cocktail.

29:32.683 --> 29:33.772
- It shrunk to 8%.

29:35.121 --> 29:36.949
- That's a treatment.

29:42.041 --> 29:44.043
- Rojas?
Looks like we got something.

29:44.086 --> 29:45.609
We'll replicate
as quick as we can

29:45.653 --> 29:47.350
and send CDC scientists
your way,

29:47.394 --> 29:49.439
but do anything you can
to limit pool of contact.

30:21.471 --> 30:23.386
- Go, go, go, I got her.

30:25.649 --> 30:27.913
- Police.
Stay calm, stay calm.

30:27.956 --> 30:29.349
Everybody make
your way outside.

30:29.392 --> 30:31.046
I'm going up,
we gotta cover the exit.

30:31.090 --> 30:32.613
- Yeah, I'm on it.
Sir, hang up the phone.

30:32.656 --> 30:34.136
Do you have a protocol to do
a full building evacuation?

30:34.180 --> 30:35.268
- Yes.

30:35.311 --> 30:36.878
- I need you
to execute that now.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.662
Is there another exit?
- There, to the right.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.192
- Police, get out of the way.

30:49.369 --> 30:50.979
Where?
Where?

30:56.506 --> 30:59.509
5021 George, I got shots fired
on the sixth floor.

31:04.079 --> 31:06.255
Come on, come on, come on.
Get out, get out.

31:08.127 --> 31:10.520
No, stay.
Go back, go back.

31:10.564 --> 31:11.695
Get up, get up,
go outside.

31:11.739 --> 31:14.046
Go outside, real slow.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.930
- No, no!
Do not come in here!

31:28.974 --> 31:31.541
- Okay, okay.
Detective Halstead, Chicago PD.

31:31.585 --> 31:32.716
I'm not coming in.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.501
- He's killing us.
Please!

31:34.544 --> 31:36.546
- You shoot, and I will shoot.

31:36.590 --> 31:38.113
- Then I won't.

31:40.637 --> 31:43.336
5021 George, advise responding.
I got eyes on the offender.

31:43.379 --> 31:44.511
Sixth floor,
southeast side of the building.

31:44.554 --> 31:46.426
He has hostages.

31:46.469 --> 31:49.559
Dr. Seldon,
I just want to talk.

31:49.603 --> 31:50.952
Okay, can I come in there
and do that?

31:50.996 --> 31:52.911
- No, no!
Do not come in.

31:54.738 --> 31:58.220
- It's either me talking
or a team of men shooting.

31:58.264 --> 32:00.353
Believe me,
whatever you're here to do...

32:00.396 --> 32:02.921
it's better with me in there,
keeping them out.

32:04.096 --> 32:05.358
What's it gonna be?

32:08.448 --> 32:12.669
- Okay, okay, come in,
but slowly and drop the weapon.

32:12.713 --> 32:13.975
Let me see it.

32:15.324 --> 32:16.891
- Okay.
- Let me see it.

32:16.935 --> 32:20.068
- Okay, I'll give you my gun.
I'll give you my gun, okay?

32:20.112 --> 32:21.591
- Very slowly.

32:21.635 --> 32:23.289
- Hailey, I'm going in.
I'm gonna keep this line open.

32:23.332 --> 32:25.595
Get Voight on the line.
Try to get eyes on him.

32:25.639 --> 32:28.598
All right, here I come.

32:28.642 --> 32:31.079
- Slowly.
- Yep, I'm moving real slow.

32:31.123 --> 32:33.516
- Turn around, turn around.
- Okay.

32:33.560 --> 32:36.258
Okay, slow, yeah?

32:36.302 --> 32:38.347
Close the door.
- All right.

32:38.391 --> 32:40.393
- Now, drop that weapon.

32:43.570 --> 32:45.311
Now, let it go.
Drop it.

32:46.355 --> 32:49.445
Good, now turn back around--
slowly, slowly.

32:49.489 --> 32:51.012
Good, good.

32:51.056 --> 32:54.711
- Everybody just stay calm.
Everything's gonna be okay.

32:59.151 --> 33:01.327
- Jay said south rear window!

33:01.370 --> 33:03.720
- I can get you in.
- Do it.

33:03.764 --> 33:05.635
Stay on evac.
I'm with Upton.

33:05.679 --> 33:08.073
Work with Fire, make sure
this building's evacuated,

33:08.116 --> 33:09.683
then get a perimeter started.

33:09.726 --> 33:12.294
Hostage mobile command
one block out.

33:12.338 --> 33:13.687
- We've got an antibiotic

33:13.730 --> 33:15.297
that's proven viable--
we can administer on-site.

33:15.341 --> 33:17.343
Where do you want us?
- Great, behind those rigs.

33:17.386 --> 33:19.519
- I need you to talk to me.
Explain what we're doing here

33:19.562 --> 33:20.737
and I'll be able to help you.

33:20.781 --> 33:23.479
- My brother's inside?
- He is.

33:23.523 --> 33:24.741
- I'm coming with you.

33:24.785 --> 33:27.396
- Just stay out of the way
and follow my lead.

33:29.181 --> 33:30.399
- Okay.

33:30.443 --> 33:33.228
Just be calm.
So why are we here?

33:33.272 --> 33:35.361
What's going on?
How can I help you, Dr. Seldon?

33:35.404 --> 33:37.319
- I don't need help.

33:37.363 --> 33:39.495
I'm not a bad person, I-I--

33:39.539 --> 33:41.671
I just needed to show them.

33:41.715 --> 33:43.151
I needed them to see,

33:43.195 --> 33:45.066
so that the whole world
could see.

33:45.110 --> 33:47.329
- Okay, see what?

33:48.417 --> 33:51.072
- See that this is how
the world's gonna end.

33:51.116 --> 33:52.291
Thousands of strains
of bacteria

33:52.334 --> 33:54.162
that we don't know
how to combat.

33:54.206 --> 33:57.513
This--this bacteria,
it kills people so fast,

33:57.557 --> 34:00.081
they barely have time
to know that they're dying.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.779
But you see,
cures need funding,

34:02.823 --> 34:05.347
and these people--
these people denied--

34:05.391 --> 34:07.132
get your hands
back on the table!

34:07.175 --> 34:08.524
That's right,
and they denied it

34:08.568 --> 34:10.091
because there's no money in it.

34:10.135 --> 34:12.180
Oh, sure, they funded
a Viagra substitute,

34:12.224 --> 34:16.793
ADHD medication,
all while these diseases exist.

34:16.837 --> 34:19.100
Diseases that could
wipe out the whole world,

34:19.144 --> 34:21.537
so I--

34:21.581 --> 34:23.104
I showed them.

34:24.410 --> 34:26.107
I made one.

34:26.151 --> 34:29.763
Yes, I killed a few
to save the many,

34:29.806 --> 34:31.460
and now
it's their choice again.

34:31.504 --> 34:33.245
Now they choose.

34:33.288 --> 34:35.160
See, now, it's a bullet

34:35.203 --> 34:37.118
or to trust me this time.

34:37.162 --> 34:40.165
A-a bullet, or I cut them,

34:40.208 --> 34:43.124
I give them the bacteria.

34:47.389 --> 34:50.131
And then my research,
the--the research

34:50.175 --> 34:52.568
that they didn't want to fund,
that's what cures them.

34:52.612 --> 34:54.744
Yeah, it's--it's their choice.

34:54.788 --> 34:58.879
A bullet to die
or my research to live.

35:15.374 --> 35:16.592
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

35:16.636 --> 35:19.117
- Doc, get behind me.

35:23.425 --> 35:24.861
- So how can I help you?

35:24.905 --> 35:26.428
You want me to get
the media here?

35:26.472 --> 35:27.603
You want me to arrange funding?

35:27.647 --> 35:30.824
- No, no, no.
It's much too late for that.

35:30.867 --> 35:32.739
It's time for you
to decide, sir.

35:32.782 --> 35:35.437
What's your choice?
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

35:35.481 --> 35:36.699
I'll help you
prove you're right.

35:36.743 --> 35:38.223
Yeah.

35:38.266 --> 35:41.487
I believe you,
so let me do it.

36:02.682 --> 36:04.510
Yeah, let me do it.

36:05.641 --> 36:07.339
Let me do it.

36:12.692 --> 36:15.434
- Okay, back up.
Back up.

36:15.477 --> 36:17.349
Here, here.

36:18.872 --> 36:21.570
You take that knife,
pick it up...

36:25.705 --> 36:26.793
Pick it up!

36:26.836 --> 36:28.838
- Okay, okay.
Picking it up.

36:31.363 --> 36:32.581
Okay, now what?

36:32.625 --> 36:34.540
- Sarge, I don't have a shot.

36:34.583 --> 36:36.890
- Now you're gonna
cut yourself.

36:36.933 --> 36:39.327
I said you are
going to cut yourself!

36:39.371 --> 36:40.763
- Okay, okay.

36:44.419 --> 36:47.553
- That's right.

36:47.596 --> 36:49.816
Good, good.
Now throw back the knife.

36:49.859 --> 36:51.383
- Okay.

36:51.426 --> 36:54.342
- Slowly.
Good.

36:54.386 --> 36:56.344
- Halstead just cut himself.
Sarge, this is flipping.

36:56.388 --> 36:57.824
I do not have a shot.

36:57.867 --> 36:59.739
- Now stay right there.
Don't move, don't move!

36:59.782 --> 37:01.349
- Hailey, I need you to get set

37:01.393 --> 37:04.004
for a high-diversion shot
at the ceiling.

37:04.047 --> 37:06.049
No joy, repeat, no joy.

37:06.093 --> 37:07.703
On my order.

37:07.747 --> 37:09.052
- Copy.

37:12.882 --> 37:14.667
- Okay, you're gonna take this,

37:14.710 --> 37:18.323
and you're gonna spray it
on the cut.

37:18.366 --> 37:19.976
Pick it up.

37:20.020 --> 37:22.022
Go ahead.
Pick it up and spray it.

37:22.065 --> 37:23.284
- Okay, okay.

37:23.328 --> 37:24.503
Okay.

37:32.989 --> 37:33.990
- Do it.

37:38.778 --> 37:40.736
Do it!

37:40.780 --> 37:42.477
- Go now.

37:59.364 --> 38:00.843
- Jay, you good?

38:00.887 --> 38:02.367
- Yeah, I'm okay.

38:15.684 --> 38:17.599
- Your first day
on CPD like this.

38:17.643 --> 38:19.949
You got somewhere
to cool off the adrenaline?

38:19.993 --> 38:21.777
- Yeah, yeah, Kev invited me
to grab some drinks

38:21.821 --> 38:22.996
with him and some other cops.

38:23.039 --> 38:24.345
- All right, that's good.

38:24.389 --> 38:26.304
Gotta find ways
to get your breath back.

38:28.480 --> 38:29.742
- Hey, you guys want
to come to Molly's tonight?

38:29.785 --> 38:32.353
- Uh, thanks, I just
kind of want quiet time.

38:32.397 --> 38:34.660
- Yeah, I think
I'm ready for home.

38:34.703 --> 38:36.444
- All right, I'll see you guys.

38:36.488 --> 38:38.577
- Night, Rojas.
- Night.

38:38.620 --> 38:40.448
- Night.
- Hey.

38:40.492 --> 38:41.623
- Yeah?

38:45.888 --> 38:49.022
- Would you want
to come with me?

38:58.510 --> 39:00.120
- Yeah.

39:01.687 --> 39:03.036
- All right.

39:07.780 --> 39:10.478
- Fear is a funny thing.

39:10.522 --> 39:13.394
Most of the time,
it brings out

39:13.438 --> 39:15.918
the very worst in people.

39:20.880 --> 39:25.885
Panic, hate,
their selfishness.

39:25.928 --> 39:29.410
Certainly saw that today.

39:29.454 --> 39:32.761
But it also has a tendency
to bring out the very best.

39:32.805 --> 39:34.546
- Hello!
I hope you're hungry.

39:34.589 --> 39:36.025
- Hey, Mama!
- Aww, come on!

39:36.069 --> 39:37.679
Look at you.
- Seriously?

39:37.723 --> 39:39.551
- I made you a little snack.
- Come on!

39:39.594 --> 39:41.814
Ah, you shouldn't have!
- A little snack?

39:41.857 --> 39:44.077
- Hey, this is for you, Mama.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.906
- Oh, my goodness.

39:46.949 --> 39:48.516
Thank you so much.

39:56.002 --> 39:57.438
- Amanda.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.484
Amanda, sweetheart,
can you hear me?

39:59.527 --> 40:01.007
Amanda?

40:02.574 --> 40:05.011
There you are.

40:05.054 --> 40:07.013
Hey, look who's here.

40:07.056 --> 40:08.928
- Amanda.

40:10.669 --> 40:12.714
- She's gonna be okay.

40:12.758 --> 40:15.238
- People who stand steady,

40:15.282 --> 40:17.458
who hold onto each other,

40:17.502 --> 40:19.895
lean on each other,

40:19.939 --> 40:23.421
find a way
to hold on to hope...

40:24.204 --> 40:28.121
To cope and run into the fear.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.236
- Herrmann.
- Thank you.

40:56.279 --> 40:58.978
- Thank you.
- Yes!

40:59.021 --> 41:01.284
- Look at this, man.

41:01.328 --> 41:03.678
- What?

41:03.722 --> 41:05.245
- Life.

41:07.813 --> 41:08.770
Yes.
