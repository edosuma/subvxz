00:16.183 --> 00:18.059
Captain?

00:19.267 --> 00:21.185
Sir?

01:03.825 --> 01:09.161
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

01:11.619 --> 01:15.037
"It's been a long time"

01:15.246 --> 01:19.080
"But my time is finally near"

01:19.289 --> 01:23.540
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

01:23.748 --> 01:26.666
"I will touch the sky"

01:26.874 --> 01:30.668
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

01:30.876 --> 01:33.877
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

01:34.086 --> 01:38.796
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

01:39.005 --> 01:41.922
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

01:42.131 --> 01:46.715
"I've got faith to believe"

01:46.924 --> 01:49.508
"I can do anything"

01:49.716 --> 01:54.218
"I've got strength of the soul"

01:54.426 --> 01:57.302
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

01:57.511 --> 02:02.846
"I can reach any star"

02:03.221 --> 02:06.973
"I've got faith"

02:07.181 --> 02:10.890
"I've got faith"

02:11.099 --> 02:15.892
"Faith of the heart"

03:03.102 --> 03:06.036
- How many?
- I saw at least 30.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.119
This place is pretty big.

03:08.228 --> 03:10.329
There could be more.

03:10.479 --> 03:13.205
Any idea who attacked the shuttle?

03:13.413 --> 03:16.122
I didn't exactly have time
to get a good look.

03:19.582 --> 03:22.917
The energy readings we got
from the other side of that moon...

03:23.375 --> 03:26.001
...could have come from the Helix.

03:39.839 --> 03:43.007
There's a wall,
about five metres high.

03:43.215 --> 03:45.592
It looks like it surrounds
this entire building.

03:45.800 --> 03:50.177
I see something that might be
a guard tower, but I can't be sure.

03:50.385 --> 03:52.011
Any people?

03:55.304 --> 03:56.888
No, sir.

04:00.763 --> 04:02.723
You up for another walk?

04:09.601 --> 04:12.059
You're the new arrivals.

04:16.144 --> 04:19.978
- Why are we here?
- Why are any of us here?

05:05.370 --> 05:07.079
Follow me.

05:27.586 --> 05:29.462
Thank you, major.

05:31.588 --> 05:33.589
Please, sit down.

05:37.173 --> 05:38.548
I can understand why you're upset.

05:38.757 --> 05:40.716
No doubt you've had
a difficult afternoon.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.300
To say the least.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.384
I meant to speak to you earlier,
but I had urgent business to attend to.

05:45.593 --> 05:47.135
I apologize.

05:47.344 --> 05:50.261
We don't see many
starship captains here.

05:51.345 --> 05:53.846
- Jonathan Archer.
- That's right.

05:54.346 --> 05:56.055
You must be Travis Mayweather.

05:56.847 --> 05:57.931
And you are?

05:58.556 --> 06:01.974
- I'm Colonel Grat.
- I take it you're the man in charge.

06:02.807 --> 06:06.809
I took the liberty to examine
the database in your shuttlecraft,

06:07.017 --> 06:09.560
so I know that you're from a planet
called Earth,

06:09.769 --> 06:12.478
and that you serve
on a vessel called Enterprise.

06:12.686 --> 06:16.229
What I don't know is what you
were doing within our military zone.

06:18.855 --> 06:20.230
Military zone?

06:20.939 --> 06:24.648
You entered orbit of our second moon.
You must have detected it.

06:25.900 --> 06:29.026
We picked up some
unusual energy readings,

06:29.233 --> 06:31.776
but we had no idea
where they were coming from.

06:32.277 --> 06:34.944
We were simply curious.

06:36.528 --> 06:39.237
Your curiosity almost got you killed.

06:39.446 --> 06:43.156
Fortunately, our patrol ship
didn't vaporize your shuttlecraft.

06:43.406 --> 06:46.990
You might think about
putting up a "no trespassing" sign.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.782
I'll pass that along.

06:49.033 --> 06:52.868
- Where are we now?
- This is a detention complex.

06:53.075 --> 06:55.452
It's several light years
from where we found you.

06:55.702 --> 06:57.578
Does everyone
that violates your territory

06:57.785 --> 07:00.037
get thrown into a place like this?

07:00.245 --> 07:01.954
We're at war with a species
that can mimic

07:02.163 --> 07:03.663
the appearance
of almost any humanoid.

07:03.872 --> 07:07.165
We had to make certain
that you weren't infiltrators.

07:07.414 --> 07:10.457
If you're worried we're Suliban,
trust me, we're not.

07:11.040 --> 07:14.917
I know.
We've already tested your DNA.

07:15.709 --> 07:17.376
You're familiar with the Cabal?

07:20.168 --> 07:21.586
Unfortunately.

07:21.836 --> 07:23.878
Then you must know about
their genetic enhancements

07:24.087 --> 07:25.671
and how dangerous they can be.

07:26.421 --> 07:27.422
Firsthand.

07:27.672 --> 07:29.714
I hope you didn't suffer
too many casualties.

07:29.964 --> 07:34.215
We've been lucky so far.

07:35.258 --> 07:37.925
We're eager
to get back to Enterprise.

07:38.134 --> 07:40.759
If you'll take us to our shuttlepod,
we'll be on our way.

07:41.009 --> 07:43.511
I'm afraid I don't have the authority
to release you.

07:44.010 --> 07:46.095
We have very strict regulations.

07:46.303 --> 07:49.721
You'll have to appear before
a magistrate on Tandar Prime.

07:49.930 --> 07:51.264
But the hearing should be brief.

07:51.472 --> 07:55.098
I'll explain that this was just
a innocent misunderstanding.

07:55.431 --> 07:59.016
- When's this hearing?
- A transport will be here in three days.

07:59.474 --> 08:00.892
Three days?

08:01.141 --> 08:03.685
I wish I could offer you
more comfortable accommodations.

08:04.143 --> 08:08.270
Unfortunately, this detention complex
is overcrowded at the moment.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.812
I would advise you
to keep to yourselves.

08:11.020 --> 08:14.563
If the Suliban give you any trouble,
simply tell one of the guards.

08:14.814 --> 08:17.981
I'd like to contact my ship,
let them know we're all right.

08:18.232 --> 08:19.649
I can't permit that, captain.

08:20.565 --> 08:21.816
Regulations?

08:22.900 --> 08:26.651
But I will call them personally
and explain the situation.

08:30.361 --> 08:31.945
Escort these men
back to their quarters.

08:32.153 --> 08:33.654
Make sure they get a proper meal.

08:35.822 --> 08:39.072
I'm sorry we couldn't have met
under better circumstances.

08:40.155 --> 08:41.990
So am I.

08:49.701 --> 08:52.494
They call this a proper meal?

08:53.119 --> 08:55.370
I should save it
for Commander Tucker.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.996
It'd make a good valve sealant.

08:58.662 --> 09:02.789
Why don't you get some sleep.
I'll take the first watch.

09:06.832 --> 09:09.458
This thing doesn't hold much.

09:12.584 --> 09:14.710
I'll be right back.

09:40.762 --> 09:43.179
How about waiting your turn?

10:05.604 --> 10:07.229
I can't believe you'd do this to a child.

10:07.438 --> 10:08.855
Do what?

10:09.063 --> 10:11.230
She's a little young
to be a member of the Cabal.

10:11.439 --> 10:13.481
You don't know
what you're talking about.

10:13.732 --> 10:17.025
I know that you're given
genetic tricks as payment.

10:17.274 --> 10:18.358
What are they giving her?

10:21.109 --> 10:24.193
I don't know who you are,
but you're wrong about us.

10:24.444 --> 10:27.361
- Is that so?
- We're not genetically enhanced,

10:27.570 --> 10:29.446
and we're not members of the Cabal.

10:30.112 --> 10:32.488
If that's true,
then what are you doing here?

10:32.697 --> 10:36.073
Didn't Colonel Grat tell you?
We're dangerous.

10:36.281 --> 10:39.199
All Suliban are dangerous.

10:39.407 --> 10:42.033
It's past curfew.

10:43.158 --> 10:45.535
We were just on our way back.

10:45.742 --> 10:47.535
Sorry, Danik.

10:47.785 --> 10:49.577
It's the second time this week.

10:49.828 --> 10:53.204
- Klev, please.
- It's only for one night.

10:53.454 --> 10:55.246
It's my fault.

10:55.496 --> 10:58.789
- I'm the one who kept them here.
- Get back to your cell.

10:59.039 --> 11:00.206
Where are you taking him?

11:00.915 --> 11:02.249
Isolation.

11:02.457 --> 11:05.458
Unless you wanna join him,
do as I say.

11:06.209 --> 11:09.001
Will you make sure she gets back?

11:10.168 --> 11:13.670
I'll see you in the morning.
Don't worry.

11:40.638 --> 11:42.013
I'd like to speak with them.

11:42.222 --> 11:44.722
I'm sorry, but regulations forbid that.

11:44.931 --> 11:46.223
Nothing to be concerned about.

11:46.431 --> 11:49.140
They've been placed in comfortable
quarters, and they're safe.

11:49.390 --> 11:51.642
If it's the same to you,
I'd rather hear it from the captain.

11:51.850 --> 11:53.850
I'm afraid that's not possible.

11:54.059 --> 11:56.894
- May we attend the hearing?
- Of course.

11:57.101 --> 11:59.102
Will they be given
legal representation?

11:59.311 --> 12:01.520
They're also free
to choose their own counsel.

12:01.729 --> 12:03.479
When you arrive at Tandar Prime,

12:03.687 --> 12:06.356
you'll be contacted
by the Central Magistrate's Ofice.

12:06.605 --> 12:10.273
- We'll need the coordinates.
- I'm sending them now.

12:10.523 --> 12:13.858
- Thank you, colonel.
- Good luck to you.

12:14.691 --> 12:15.817
Hoshi?

12:16.067 --> 12:20.152
I can't trace the signal. He must
have scrambled the carrier wave.

12:20.402 --> 12:21.569
Keep at it.

12:22.111 --> 12:25.196
What are you suggesting we do?
Mount a rescue?

12:25.446 --> 12:26.946
The thought crossed my mind.

12:27.196 --> 12:30.363
It would be a mistake to provoke
the Tandarans any further.

12:30.614 --> 12:33.240
So we just sit on our hands?

12:33.490 --> 12:36.366
- The hearing's in three days.
- And what if they're found guilty?

12:36.575 --> 12:38.575
Sentenced to 30 years in prison?

12:38.825 --> 12:39.867
That's unlikely.

12:40.659 --> 12:42.660
If you want to explore alien cultures,

12:42.869 --> 12:45.703
you'll need to learn
to respect their laws.

12:45.912 --> 12:49.079
If Captain Archer were here,
I'm sure he'd agree.

12:51.788 --> 12:54.039
If you'd like,
I'll contact the Vulcan High Command.

12:54.247 --> 12:56.290
They might be willing
to send an arbitrator.

12:56.540 --> 12:58.624
A Vulcan lawyer?

12:59.124 --> 13:01.667
They'd be better off
getting the electric chair.

13:02.042 --> 13:03.751
Electric chair?

13:04.543 --> 13:06.461
Never mind.

13:07.836 --> 13:10.336
Set a course for Tandar Prime.

13:41.223 --> 13:43.099
Hello again.

13:49.226 --> 13:51.685
I hope isolation wasn't too rough.

13:51.893 --> 13:54.103
It gets very cold in there at night.

13:54.352 --> 13:57.478
Sometimes I wish
I was genetically enhanced.

14:02.064 --> 14:05.982
If you've come to apologize, don't.
It was just a misunderstanding.

14:07.607 --> 14:12.901
Actually, I was hoping to find out
what's going on around here.

14:14.527 --> 14:16.527
Maybe you should talk to
one of the Tandarans.

14:16.735 --> 14:18.611
I spoke to Colonel Grat,

14:18.861 --> 14:21.362
but I get the feeling
he's not telling me the whole story.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.489
Archer.

14:26.489 --> 14:28.698
My name is Jonathan Archer.

14:41.370 --> 14:44.454
- More?
- I've had plenty, thank you.

14:44.871 --> 14:46.746
It was very good.

14:46.955 --> 14:48.622
You look like Tandarans.

14:49.539 --> 14:53.082
Why don't you go
and find your friends.

14:53.707 --> 14:57.125
- And don't forget curfew.
- I won't.

15:04.753 --> 15:07.378
We're not criminals, captain.

15:07.587 --> 15:09.880
And we're not soldiers.

15:10.505 --> 15:13.006
The only thing we're guilty of
is being Suliban.

15:13.756 --> 15:16.341
They must have tested your DNA...

15:16.549 --> 15:18.591
...figured out you haven't been
genetically altered.

15:18.799 --> 15:22.509
As far as they're concerned,
that doesn't mean anything.

15:23.927 --> 15:26.636
You believed I was a member
of the Cabal, didn't you?

15:28.211 --> 15:29.595
Didn't you?

15:32.471 --> 15:33.722
Yes, I did.

15:35.680 --> 15:39.640
All that seems to matter
is the way we look.

15:40.315 --> 15:46.477
Be careful of their wicked smiles
Their shining yellow eyes

15:46.584 --> 15:50.144
At night they'll squeeze
Right through your door

15:50.669 --> 15:52.937
And everybody dies

15:54.612 --> 15:59.231
The Tandaran children used to tease
my daughter with that nursery rhyme.

16:01.507 --> 16:06.233
At least here,
she doesn't have to hear it anymore.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.943
This is an internment camp.

16:10.343 --> 16:14.403
Detention Complex 26.

16:14.987 --> 16:17.904
I've heard it's one of their nicer ones.

16:18.155 --> 16:19.488
Why did this happen?

16:19.697 --> 16:23.031
The Cabal began their attacks
eight years ago.

16:23.823 --> 16:26.949
It wasn't long before the Tandarans
started to question the loyalty

16:27.158 --> 16:30.742
of all Suliban living in their territory.

16:31.784 --> 16:36.911
We were rounded up.
Relocated, as they like to say.

16:37.703 --> 16:41.997
They told us it was only temporary,
it was for our own safety.

16:42.705 --> 16:44.914
"Once the Cabal
has been destroyed,

16:45.123 --> 16:47.790
you will be free to go back
to your homes."

16:48.540 --> 16:50.499
We're still waiting.

16:50.749 --> 16:56.252
There are 89 of us here,
thousands more in other camps.

16:56.960 --> 17:02.129
Every one of us used to be citizens
on worlds in the Tandar Sector.

17:05.338 --> 17:09.756
Did you know that I was born in
the same town as one of the guards?

17:10.006 --> 17:11.882
Major Klev.

17:12.589 --> 17:15.800
I was friends with his brother
when we were growing up.

17:17.759 --> 17:20.593
What about the government
on the Suliban homeworld?

17:20.801 --> 17:23.053
Don't they have something to say
about this?

17:23.301 --> 17:25.929
I'm sure they would if they still existed.

17:27.012 --> 17:31.514
Our homeworld became uninhabitable
300 years ago.

17:32.223 --> 17:35.599
Most Suliban are nomadic,

17:35.808 --> 17:39.517
but some of us have assimilated
into other cultures.

17:40.142 --> 17:45.519
My grandfather made the unfortunate
decision to settle on Tandar Prime.

17:46.686 --> 17:48.437
Yes?

17:51.021 --> 17:55.648
- What are they doing here?
- It's all right. I asked them.

17:58.482 --> 18:01.274
This came today.

18:06.818 --> 18:08.235
What species are you?

18:09.861 --> 18:11.195
We're human.

18:11.987 --> 18:15.738
- Never heard of them.
- Sajen, you're being rude.

18:18.239 --> 18:19.406
Bad news?

18:22.783 --> 18:24.700
It's my wife.

18:25.617 --> 18:27.910
We were separated
during the relocation.

18:28.451 --> 18:30.827
She's in one of the other camps.

18:31.328 --> 18:34.703
Her transfer was rejected again.

18:35.204 --> 18:38.413
She tried to appeal their decision...

18:38.663 --> 18:41.873
...but as usual, they wouldn't listen.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.874
I'm sorry.

18:45.665 --> 18:48.167
Midday inspection.

18:48.833 --> 18:51.168
Try to look your best.

18:56.462 --> 18:58.545
Thank you for lunch.

18:58.754 --> 19:00.296
Thank you for listening.

19:04.590 --> 19:08.382
- Why'd you bring them here?
- Maybe I was tired of talking to you.

19:08.591 --> 19:11.091
They could be working with Grat.

19:24.263 --> 19:28.597
- Hey.
- Colonel Grat wants to see you.

19:33.182 --> 19:34.475
Just him.

19:45.521 --> 19:49.230
I understand you were out after curfew
last night, arguing with a Suliban.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.356
It was just a misunderstanding.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.731
You should have taken my advice,
captain.

19:54.899 --> 19:56.525
I know.

19:56.859 --> 19:59.067
I know. It's a big problem with me.

19:59.276 --> 20:01.402
I'm just too damn curious.

20:01.859 --> 20:06.362
Whenever I meet new people, I
can't resist trying to get to know them.

20:06.611 --> 20:10.238
I'm certainly getting to know a lot
about the Suliban around here.

20:10.989 --> 20:13.155
I admire your spirit of exploration,

20:13.364 --> 20:16.031
but in this case,
it could get you into trouble.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.824
Keep to yourself.

20:18.282 --> 20:20.033
I'll do my best.

20:21.575 --> 20:25.077
- Unless you have any more advice...
- No.

20:25.285 --> 20:27.119
But...

20:27.661 --> 20:29.829
...I do have a question.

20:30.995 --> 20:33.913
Have you ever been to Oklahoma?

20:34.872 --> 20:37.957
I guess you could say
I'm a curious man myself.

20:38.206 --> 20:40.541
After you mentioned
that you were familiar with the Cabal,

20:40.749 --> 20:44.084
I decided to speak with
our intelligence agency.

20:44.292 --> 20:47.751
They've uncovered
some interesting facts.

20:48.168 --> 20:51.670
Apparently, two Suliban soldiers
crash-landed

20:51.878 --> 20:54.879
near a town called Broken Bow,
Oklahoma.

20:55.129 --> 20:57.463
They were chasing a Klingon,
of all things.

20:58.963 --> 21:01.757
I was wondering if you could provide
some insight

21:01.964 --> 21:03.840
into what they were doing there.

21:04.424 --> 21:06.258
I wouldn't know.

21:06.633 --> 21:09.884
- You'd have to talk to my superiors.
- Oh, I think you know a great deal.

21:10.092 --> 21:13.636
Enterprise took the Klingon
back to his homeworld.

21:14.011 --> 21:15.720
Isn't that right?

21:19.596 --> 21:21.305
Rigel Ten.

21:21.513 --> 21:22.847
You made a detour there.

21:23.056 --> 21:27.058
From what I'm told,
you contacted a woman named Sarin.

21:27.265 --> 21:29.099
You remember her?

21:30.516 --> 21:33.893
Well, I'll remind you. She was the head
of a Suliban resistance cell.

21:34.101 --> 21:38.103
She was killed by the Cabal
in a firefight at the trade complex.

21:38.311 --> 21:41.063
Several of our people saw you there,
captain.

21:41.271 --> 21:44.564
I believe you were injured,
a shot in the leg.

21:44.772 --> 21:47.523
Do I have to ask your superiors
about that as well?

21:50.982 --> 21:54.275
- What exactly do you want?
- Information.

21:54.484 --> 21:56.610
What do you know about the Cabal?

21:56.818 --> 21:58.902
What genetic enhancements
you've seen.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.612
Helix deployments.
Who's giving them their orders?

22:01.862 --> 22:04.529
You've got plenty of Suliban here.
Why not ask them?

22:04.779 --> 22:07.530
- We know they wouldn't be helpful.
- Then why are they in prison?

22:07.989 --> 22:11.324
- That's a discussion for another time.
- There are families here, children.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.824
One man hasn't seen his wife in years.

22:14.074 --> 22:15.116
Tell me what you know.

22:15.366 --> 22:18.576
- They don't deserve this treatment.
- They're here for their own protection.

22:18.826 --> 22:20.410
Oh, really?

22:24.870 --> 22:28.037
The last thing we wanted to do
was build these detention centres

22:28.288 --> 22:30.414
but we had no choice.

22:30.621 --> 22:32.873
When the Cabal began their activities,

22:33.081 --> 22:35.582
there was a great deal of fear
among the Tandarans.

22:35.790 --> 22:37.833
There were instances of violence.

22:38.333 --> 22:41.209
Fourteen innocent Suliban were killed
in one day alone.

22:41.418 --> 22:44.252
We had to find a way to keep them
out of danger.

22:45.752 --> 22:49.712
Then why not just let them find
another place to live?

22:49.920 --> 22:51.879
They wouldn't get very far.

22:52.130 --> 22:54.547
It's ironic, but once
they're out of Tandaran territory,

22:54.755 --> 22:57.631
the Cabal will hunt them down,
and turn them all into soldiers.

22:57.840 --> 23:02.466
- They're better off here.
- I've met a few Suliban who disagree.

23:03.759 --> 23:06.844
One of the Cabal leaders
is a man named Silik.

23:07.051 --> 23:09.761
He infiltrated your vessel approximately
three months ago

23:09.970 --> 23:13.637
posing as a Borothan pilgrim.
What did he want?

23:14.763 --> 23:18.014
Did he speak
of the Temporal Cold War?

23:18.222 --> 23:19.639
Answer me!

23:27.017 --> 23:29.893
This conversation is taking longer
than I expected.

23:30.102 --> 23:33.269
I'd hate to see you miss
that transport tomorrow morning.

23:33.478 --> 23:36.354
The next one won't arrive
for another 60 days.

23:52.693 --> 23:55.110
I'm afraid the hearing's
been postponed.

23:55.361 --> 23:57.736
- Why?
- The magistrate assigned to the case

23:57.945 --> 24:00.196
is in the middle of
a very complex proceeding,

24:00.446 --> 24:02.404
and it's taking more time
than he expected.

24:02.655 --> 24:04.405
How much longer
are they gonna have to wait?

24:04.656 --> 24:06.657
Hopefully, not more than a few days.

24:06.865 --> 24:08.823
If you stay on course
for Tandar Prime,

24:09.074 --> 24:12.450
I'll arrange for an ambassador to show
you our capital city when you arrive.

24:12.659 --> 24:14.826
We're not interested in a tour.

24:15.035 --> 24:18.494
- We just want our people back.
- I'm doing everything I can.

24:18.702 --> 24:21.578
Try to be patient.
You'll hear from me soon.

24:22.621 --> 24:24.579
I've isolated their carrier frequency.

24:24.788 --> 24:26.705
- Do you see it?
- I'm tracing it now.

24:26.914 --> 24:29.539
Bearing 178 mark 12.

24:29.790 --> 24:31.832
- How far?
- Five-point-two light years.

24:34.082 --> 24:38.126
All I'm saying is we go take a look
for ourselves, make sure they're okay.

24:40.501 --> 24:41.836
Proceed.

24:43.794 --> 24:47.379
Most of the people we meet have been
pretty eager to get to know us,

24:47.588 --> 24:50.672
but we've had our share
of unfortunate encounters.

24:50.881 --> 24:53.007
I guess you could say
this is one of them.

24:53.214 --> 24:55.632
I've lived with Tandarans all my life.

24:55.841 --> 24:58.300
They're decent people
for the most part.

24:58.508 --> 25:01.259
What about you? What did you do
before you ended up here?

25:01.468 --> 25:05.052
I was director of research
at an engineering institute.

25:05.261 --> 25:07.220
It's in the Querella Province.

25:07.428 --> 25:09.387
You should see it...

25:10.013 --> 25:12.805
...assuming your hearing goes well.

25:13.055 --> 25:15.639
I've got a feeling we could be here
for a while.

25:16.307 --> 25:20.933
Why not tell Grat what you know?
Get yourself out of here.

25:22.225 --> 25:24.476
I don't like being strong-armed.

25:25.101 --> 25:28.561
And I don't like what he's doing
to you and the others.

25:36.355 --> 25:39.148
Has anyone ever tried
to get out of here?

25:39.648 --> 25:41.607
You mean escape?

25:42.441 --> 25:46.984
A couple of years ago, three men
pried open one of the security grates.

25:47.192 --> 25:49.610
They tried to get to the docking bay.

25:49.819 --> 25:51.653
- Docking bay?
- Yes.

25:51.861 --> 25:54.028
It's about 100 metres away.

25:54.237 --> 25:57.530
It's where they keep Suliban ships
they've impounded.

25:59.738 --> 26:02.823
- What happened?
- Oh, they managed to get inside.

26:03.031 --> 26:06.700
But before they could reach a vessel,
all three of them were killed.

26:07.825 --> 26:14.452
Colonel Grat made a ridiculous claim
that they were armed.

26:14.661 --> 26:18.204
They might have succeeded
with a little help from the outside.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.497
It won't be long before
Enterprise comes looking

26:22.705 --> 26:24.123
for Mayweather and me.

26:32.334 --> 26:34.960
I appreciate the offer, captain,

26:35.168 --> 26:39.294
but I doubt many people here
would be willing to take the risk.

26:40.379 --> 26:41.837
Have you asked them?

26:47.506 --> 26:49.423
How many ships
are in that docking bay?

27:05.554 --> 27:07.388
Writing a letter?

27:08.305 --> 27:09.472
It's a journal.

27:11.473 --> 27:14.057
Could be valuable some day.

27:14.557 --> 27:16.892
People will wanna know
what happened here.

27:18.184 --> 27:20.185
I doubt anyone will ever read this.

27:20.601 --> 27:22.352
Then why are you writing it?

27:23.602 --> 27:24.895
Why do you care?

27:25.478 --> 27:29.313
I see how you look at us.
Suliban terrify you.

27:29.521 --> 27:31.730
You wouldn't be surprised
if I slithered up this wall,

27:31.938 --> 27:34.814
or turned my face inside out.

27:35.690 --> 27:39.150
Cabal. Suliban.

27:39.608 --> 27:41.525
It's all the same to you.

27:41.776 --> 27:43.318
That's not true.

28:12.162 --> 28:14.829
- What took you so long?
- Are you all right?

28:15.038 --> 28:18.205
- More or less.
- We're picking up Suliban bio-signs.

28:18.414 --> 28:19.789
It's not what you think.

28:19.998 --> 28:22.123
Are you sure this is
a secure frequency?

28:22.331 --> 28:24.040
I'm triaxilating the signal, sir.

28:24.249 --> 28:27.125
If we were in Starfleet headquarters,
no one would pick it up.

28:27.333 --> 28:28.792
Good. Where are you?

28:29.001 --> 28:31.586
In orbit. It won't be long
before we're detected.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.878
I'm getting a transporter lock
on you now, captain.

28:34.086 --> 28:35.837
Say the word
and we'll bring you both home.

28:36.045 --> 28:37.546
Hang on, Trip.

28:37.754 --> 28:39.546
We're not ready to leave just yet.

28:40.213 --> 28:43.339
Those Suliban you detected
are prisoners too.

28:43.548 --> 28:45.549
But they're no more guilty
than we are.

28:45.965 --> 28:47.966
I wanna help them get out of here.

28:48.174 --> 28:49.675
Captain?

28:49.883 --> 28:52.300
Have you ever heard of Manzanar,
sub-commander?

28:53.135 --> 28:56.386
- I'm not familiar with that planet.
- It's not a planet.

28:56.594 --> 29:01.430
It was an internment camp on Earth
during the Second World War.

29:01.638 --> 29:04.431
Japanese-American citizens
were imprisoned there,

29:04.639 --> 29:07.056
even though
they didn't do anything wrong.

29:07.265 --> 29:09.182
The same thing's happening here.

29:09.432 --> 29:12.100
I thought you decided not to interfere
with other cultures.

29:13.517 --> 29:15.768
In this case, I'm making an exception.

29:16.017 --> 29:18.727
- Understood?
- Yes, captain.

29:20.852 --> 29:24.062
I've met a Suliban
who knows this camp inside and out.

29:24.271 --> 29:27.605
We've been working on a plan,
but we're going to need your help.

29:28.106 --> 29:29.898
We'll need a few of your people,

29:30.148 --> 29:31.940
anyone with experience
with particle weapons.

29:32.148 --> 29:34.982
We won't make it ten metres outside
the complex before we're shot.

29:35.191 --> 29:37.693
- Like the others.
- And even if we did get to the ships

29:37.901 --> 29:42.319
and managed to lift off,
there are patrol vessels in the area.

29:42.820 --> 29:44.528
Enterprise can handle them.

29:44.736 --> 29:46.821
And once we've made
this miraculous escape,

29:47.029 --> 29:49.446
where do you expect us to go?

29:49.905 --> 29:53.865
All we have to do
is get out of Tandaran territory.

29:55.407 --> 29:58.991
After that, we can set a course
for the Niburon Colonies.

29:59.200 --> 30:01.785
I know some people there.
They might be willing to help us.

30:01.992 --> 30:03.743
It's too dangerous.

30:03.952 --> 30:07.620
Would you rather spend
the rest of your life in prison?

30:10.204 --> 30:14.164
You're placing a lot of trust in people
you've only known for three days.

30:14.373 --> 30:16.915
For all we know, they've been planted
here to stage this revolt,

30:17.123 --> 30:19.374
so Grat would finally
have a reason to kill all of us.

30:19.582 --> 30:23.375
- We're not working for the Tandarans.
- Think of your daughter.

30:23.626 --> 30:25.502
Are you willing to risk her life too?

30:27.960 --> 30:30.628
We're getting out of here, Sajen.

30:31.420 --> 30:35.088
I'm not going to help you
plan our suicide.

30:39.381 --> 30:43.050
I hope the others
were more enthusiastic.

30:43.257 --> 30:46.009
This is the wall
that I was telling you about.

30:46.217 --> 30:49.218
It's only 40 metres
from the docking bay.

30:56.346 --> 30:59.430
Have you had a chance to reconsider?

31:01.598 --> 31:04.140
I'm willing to compromise, captain.

31:05.016 --> 31:08.600
Just tell me what you know
about Silik.

31:09.392 --> 31:16.519
Well, he's about this tall,
a little on the scrawny side.

31:17.061 --> 31:18.312
Bad teeth.

31:19.187 --> 31:21.229
If you're unwilling
to discuss the Suliban,

31:21.438 --> 31:23.981
maybe you can help me
with something else.

31:24.189 --> 31:27.232
We detected some unusual
energy readings last night.

31:27.440 --> 31:29.899
At first we thought
it was random interference,

31:30.150 --> 31:32.650
but after examining
the readings more closely,

31:32.859 --> 31:35.818
we discovered
they were coming from your quarters.

31:36.235 --> 31:39.903
You should check your sensors.
They're obviously malfunctioning.

31:40.361 --> 31:43.113
I'm told they're working perfectly.

31:49.490 --> 31:50.699
Sorry, captain.

31:50.949 --> 31:53.032
We found this
in Ensign Mayweather's pocket,

31:53.241 --> 31:55.784
but he wouldn't say how it got there.

32:01.661 --> 32:03.869
I was hoping you could tell me.

32:08.539 --> 32:09.872
Take him to isolation.

32:22.627 --> 32:25.336
Coming in low from the east,
I could evade the proximity sensors.

32:25.545 --> 32:27.003
This appears to be a pulse cannon.

32:27.212 --> 32:29.171
It'll be my first target.

32:30.171 --> 32:31.421
Bridge to Sickbay.

32:31.672 --> 32:33.840
- Phlox here.
- What's your status?

32:34.047 --> 32:36.340
Finishing as we speak.

32:36.590 --> 32:39.216
Though I'm not completely happy
with the nose.

32:40.508 --> 32:43.260
- It's almost time.
- Understood.

32:44.843 --> 32:46.802
It's Captain Archer.

32:47.427 --> 32:49.178
Put him through.

32:50.345 --> 32:51.762
Go ahead, captain.

32:51.970 --> 32:55.555
You seem to be of-course. I thought
you were headed for Tandar Prime.

32:55.764 --> 32:57.764
What brings you here?

32:58.014 --> 32:59.515
Where's Captain Archer?

32:59.723 --> 33:02.266
If you're thinking about trying
to circumvent our legal system,

33:02.474 --> 33:03.934
I advise against it.

33:04.809 --> 33:08.727
You come any closer to our planet,
and my patrol ships will open fire.

33:20.981 --> 33:22.482
What happened to you?

33:22.690 --> 33:24.774
What do you care?

33:25.858 --> 33:29.651
Danik's been looking for your captain.
Have you seen him?

33:30.068 --> 33:32.486
You might try isolation.

33:33.652 --> 33:36.528
Still think we're working
with the Tandarans?

33:37.570 --> 33:39.780
You know, we could have left
this place a long time ago

33:39.988 --> 33:41.781
if we hadn't decided to help you.

33:42.031 --> 33:43.364
I never asked for your help.

33:44.323 --> 33:45.782
Why?

33:46.115 --> 33:47.866
Because we're not Suliban?

33:48.283 --> 33:51.742
Because we look a little too much
like Tandarans?

33:52.284 --> 33:54.535
I'll admit, when I first came here,

33:54.743 --> 33:58.244
it wasn't easy to see past
my preconceptions about the Suliban.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.621
But I did.

34:01.454 --> 34:03.538
Why can't you?

34:15.792 --> 34:18.085
We're being hailed. It's him.

34:22.795 --> 34:25.963
Check your sensors and you'll see
two patrol ships headed toward you.

34:26.213 --> 34:29.422
We didn't come here to fight.
We came to talk with you.

34:29.672 --> 34:32.674
They'll have a weapons lock on
your vessel in less than one minute.

34:33.215 --> 34:34.924
Do you eat meat, colonel?

34:35.300 --> 34:37.426
- What?
- Our chef is preparing a meal

34:37.632 --> 34:40.759
in your honour, and I was curious
whether you're vegetarian.

34:41.552 --> 34:43.469
I was hoping you'd join me
for dinner.

34:43.678 --> 34:46.304
It would give us an opportunity
to get acquainted.

34:46.554 --> 34:48.594
You have 45 seconds to leave orbit.

34:48.804 --> 34:51.097
I can't believe you're really going
to destroy our vessel

34:51.306 --> 34:53.806
over a trivial incident like this.

34:54.014 --> 34:56.433
I can tell you're an enlightened man.

34:56.639 --> 35:00.976
All I'm asking for is a chance to show
you that we're enlightened as well.

35:01.184 --> 35:04.227
We're transmitting a copy
of Earth's historical database

35:04.435 --> 35:06.477
along with the Starfleet Charter,

35:06.686 --> 35:10.312
and a record of all human contacts
with alien species.

35:10.521 --> 35:13.021
If you have any doubts
about our intentions,

35:13.272 --> 35:15.522
this material should lay them to rest.

35:15.730 --> 35:18.023
Send him the Vulcan database as well.

35:18.232 --> 35:22.024
I think you'll find that my people have
a great deal in common with you too.

35:22.233 --> 35:23.692
You're jamming our frequencies.

35:23.900 --> 35:25.567
Break of your transmission now.

35:25.818 --> 35:27.819
What about dinner?
Should I set a...?

35:28.027 --> 35:30.736
I'm not gonna warn you again.
End your transmission and leave orbit.

35:33.362 --> 35:34.446
Mr Tucker.

35:36.571 --> 35:37.614
It's done.

35:37.863 --> 35:40.448
Those patrol ships are closing fast.

35:40.657 --> 35:42.657
Get us out of here.

36:00.247 --> 36:01.872
Yes?

36:04.540 --> 36:06.666
I understand you're looking for
a way out of here.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.500
Who are you?

36:14.044 --> 36:15.919
Don't you recognize me, Travis?

36:16.503 --> 36:18.170
Malcolm?

36:18.670 --> 36:20.296
In the flesh.

36:20.545 --> 36:23.963
Oh, you look worse than I do.
What happened?

36:24.214 --> 36:25.214
Long story.

36:28.257 --> 36:30.966
- How did you get down here?
- Transporter.

36:31.175 --> 36:33.300
I think I'm finally getting used to it.

36:33.509 --> 36:36.093
- Are you sure you weren't detected?
- Thanks to Hoshi.

36:36.301 --> 36:38.552
She kept the sensors occupied.

36:38.761 --> 36:41.011
Congratulations, ensign.

36:41.261 --> 36:45.555
Your case is about to be dismissed.

36:51.349 --> 36:54.558
The isolation block is here.
He's in one of these cells.

36:54.767 --> 36:56.142
I'll find him.

36:56.351 --> 36:59.602
- The charges?
- They're in place.

37:00.143 --> 37:01.935
Are you up for this?

37:04.103 --> 37:05.312
Nightly inspection.

37:05.520 --> 37:07.188
You said
it wasn't for another 15 minutes.

37:07.396 --> 37:09.314
I better get back.

37:09.521 --> 37:11.355
See you in orbit.

37:11.564 --> 37:13.565
Good luck.

37:15.441 --> 37:16.941
- Reed to Enterprise.
- Go ahead.

37:17.192 --> 37:19.191
The guards are ahead of schedule.
Your status?

37:19.400 --> 37:21.484
We're 200,000 kilometres away.

37:21.693 --> 37:24.027
We're going to need you
to speed things up a little.

37:24.235 --> 37:25.861
We'll do our best.

37:44.201 --> 37:46.452
- Here they come.
- Polarize the hull plating.

37:46.660 --> 37:48.494
Stand by weapons.

37:55.205 --> 37:56.914
Aft torpedoes.

37:57.122 --> 37:58.747
Fire.

38:00.456 --> 38:03.250
- Two direct hits. They're veering off.
- Take us down.

38:09.751 --> 38:11.585
- Did they follow us?
- They took heavy damage.

38:11.794 --> 38:14.004
They're both attempting to land.

38:15.254 --> 38:18.922
- You're clear to launch, commander.
- Acknowledged.

38:29.175 --> 38:31.176
- Go ahead.
- He's approaching the compound.

38:31.385 --> 38:33.386
- Two minutes.
- Tell him...

38:33.802 --> 38:35.386
Get out there.

38:54.643 --> 38:59.895
If this happens again,
you'll all be spending time in isolation.

39:01.104 --> 39:03.146
Major, do you have a second?

39:05.106 --> 39:06.980
I don't mean to cause any trouble,

39:07.231 --> 39:10.482
but I was wondering if it might be
possible to get some better food.

39:10.732 --> 39:12.983
No offence, but the meals here
are pretty awful.

39:13.191 --> 39:15.234
Eat what you're given.

39:15.442 --> 39:16.609
I'll try.

39:16.859 --> 39:20.027
But I'm not sure I can hold down
another bowl of that...

39:20.236 --> 39:23.362
What do you call it?
It tastes like sawdust.

39:24.029 --> 39:25.321
Is that what they make you eat?

39:25.529 --> 39:28.155
Because if it is, I'd think about
going on a hunger strike.

39:28.364 --> 39:30.906
- I don't know how you...
- Enough!

39:45.244 --> 39:47.621
Go, go.

39:56.582 --> 39:57.999
Reed to Tucker.

39:58.208 --> 40:01.292
- The wall's down.
- I see it. Stand by.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.506
Hurry. Go with the others.

40:18.423 --> 40:21.883
Hurry. Hurry. Go. Go.

40:22.133 --> 40:23.592
Hurry.

40:28.635 --> 40:32.845
- Father!
- I'll be there soon, Narra. Go.

40:34.345 --> 40:35.596
Go!

40:47.434 --> 40:49.143
Good to see you, Malcolm.

40:50.143 --> 40:51.935
How'd you know it was me?

40:57.438 --> 40:59.021
You have no idea what you've done.

40:59.229 --> 41:02.647
You haven't freed these people.
You've condemned them.

41:17.194 --> 41:20.320
My father's back at the common area.
He needs help.

41:22.446 --> 41:23.822
Please.

41:26.906 --> 41:29.907
- I'll go.
- No, wait.

41:36.159 --> 41:38.785
You had no right to interfere.

41:38.993 --> 41:41.537
This isn't about my rights.
It's about theirs.

41:41.745 --> 41:43.537
They have no rights.

41:43.745 --> 41:46.996
They lost them the moment
the Cabal began attacking us.

41:47.205 --> 41:49.248
Do you know how many people
the Cabal have murdered?

41:49.456 --> 41:52.290
How many ships they destroyed?
Colonies?

41:52.499 --> 41:54.500
You just gave them 89 new soldiers.

41:54.707 --> 41:56.583
What makes you think
they'll join the Cabal?

41:56.833 --> 41:59.126
These people have nothing left.
They're desperate.

41:59.376 --> 42:01.877
They'll never be able to resist
what the Cabal has to offer.

42:02.127 --> 42:03.586
I haven't been here very long,

42:03.795 --> 42:06.462
but I seem to know these people
a hell of a lot better than you do.

42:33.138 --> 42:34.222
Archer to Enterprise.

42:34.430 --> 42:36.806
- Go ahead, captain.
- We're on our way.

42:37.015 --> 42:40.308
- Where are those patrol ships?
- They won't pose a threat.

42:40.516 --> 42:42.475
And the Suliban?

42:44.267 --> 42:47.018
- Their vessels are breaking orbit.
- Good work.

42:47.268 --> 42:48.727
We'll see you in a few minutes.

42:48.935 --> 42:51.811
Tell the doctor to meet us in Sickbay.

42:52.062 --> 42:55.313
My skin is really starting to itch.

42:55.521 --> 42:57.731
I'll let him know.

43:00.774 --> 43:02.316
Captain...

43:03.232 --> 43:05.358
...think they'll make it?

43:07.109 --> 43:11.402
Do I think they'll get out of Tandaran
space safely?

43:11.611 --> 43:13.445
Yes.

43:14.570 --> 43:17.154
Do I think they'll be all right?
