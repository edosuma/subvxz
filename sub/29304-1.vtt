WEBVTT

02:37.282 --> 02:39.648
Norman Francis Vandivier.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.867
Right where I left you.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.663
Didn't you promise never
to walk through that door again?

02:50.671 --> 02:52.707
Yeah, well,
you make a lot of promises

02:52.714 --> 02:55.080
when you're puking up
a gallon of Mai Tais.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.302
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too, Jim.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.422
Back from your exile in Panama?

03:03.433 --> 03:05.344
As a matter of fact, I am.

03:05.352 --> 03:08.594
We asked the Navy real nice
if we could come back to Pearl.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.220
Surprisingly, they said yes.

03:10.232 --> 03:12.223
Yeah. You always
were persuasive.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.145
It wasn't just me.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.234
When I told the brass
that Norman Vandivier

03:16.238 --> 03:17.978
wasn't having
any fun without me,

03:17.989 --> 03:19.445
they signed the orders
right away.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.609
- Well.
- Yeah.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.198
Wish I had known
about my amazing

03:22.202 --> 03:23.612
influential name before.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.202
Welcome home.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.572
It's damn good to be back.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.450
I swear, Panama must be
what hell is like.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.042
- Hmm.
- It's hot.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.627
There are mosquitoes
the size of birds.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.917
And crocodiles.
Goddamn crocodiles.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.917
Hmm. So where's your band
of misfits?

03:39.928 --> 03:41.634
Uh, well, they hit
the Hotel Street

03:41.638 --> 03:43.094
as soon as we hit the dock.

03:43.098 --> 03:45.180
I came here
on account of the fact

03:45.183 --> 03:46.514
that you owe me so many drinks.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.474
Well, you're way behind.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.520
What'll it be, Lieutenant?

03:52.524 --> 03:54.014
Let's get a whiskey and soda.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.185
That I can do.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.063
Who's the letter to?

03:58.071 --> 03:59.982
Some beautiful hula girl?

03:59.990 --> 04:02.322
Aw, shucks, Lieutenant,
I'm just writing my ma.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.906
Hmm. Yeah.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.322
The only girl in my life
is the Big "E".

04:06.329 --> 04:09.036
Right. Big "".E.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.326
She is one hell of a lady, huh?

04:11.334 --> 04:13.620
She's got men inside of her
24 hours a day.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.368
Ah. Jealousy,
such an ugly thing.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.995
No. No. It's not jealousy.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.668
It's just that I happen
to have a new lady

04:18.675 --> 04:19.959
in my life as well,
thanks for asking.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.003
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

04:21.011 --> 04:24.128
- Okay.
- Brand-new PBY Catalina.

04:24.139 --> 04:26.130
Well, congratulations.

04:26.141 --> 04:27.847
- Thank you.
- You know, she's a real beaut.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.012
Faster and sexier
than the old model.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.260
Hmm.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.886
Who's jealous now?

04:32.898 --> 04:35.685
Well, the Dauntless
is no speed demon, but...

04:35.692 --> 04:37.899
I'm pretty sure
you wouldn't wanna race me.

04:37.903 --> 04:40.519
I'm sure she's fast in the dive,

04:40.530 --> 04:42.270
but how fast is she
in the water?

04:44.326 --> 04:46.487
Well, let's hope
I never find that out.

04:46.495 --> 04:48.861
- Agreed.
- Attacked the Wake Island.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.453
- Cheers, bro.
- And this morning,

04:50.457 --> 04:53.915
the Japanese attacked
Midway Island.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.160
The United States of America

04:56.171 --> 04:58.412
is suddenly
and deliberately attacked

04:58.423 --> 05:00.914
by naval and air forces

05:00.926 --> 05:03.963
of the Empire of Japan.

05:03.970 --> 05:09.048
I have, with the
Congress, declare

05:09.059 --> 05:12.472
that since the unprovoked

05:12.479 --> 05:17.143
and dastardly attacks by Japan

05:17.150 --> 05:23.396
on Sunday, December 7th, 1941,

05:23.406 --> 05:29.276
a state of war has existed

05:29.287 --> 05:31.448
between the United States

05:31.456 --> 05:33.663
and the Japanese Empire.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.134
You tell the ladies
you're a helldiver,

05:54.145 --> 05:55.726
and they just swoon.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.345
I haven't flown a biplane
since training.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.313
- That's not the point.
- They hear helldivers,

05:59.317 --> 06:01.649
and they think of the movie.
They think of Clark Gable.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.143
- Then you're in.
- I don't even know

06:03.154 --> 06:05.145
what this movie is about
besides helldivers.

06:05.156 --> 06:07.112
- And I can't dance.
- There wasn't no dancing in it.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.448
You're thinking of Gene Kelly.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.736
No, I'm not.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.154
He danced in that movie.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.948
That big number
with Norma Shearer.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.038
"Idiot's Delight"?
You saw a stinker like that,

06:15.041 --> 06:16.906
but you didn't see a classic
like "Hell Divers"?

06:16.918 --> 06:18.624
- I guess not.
- That's a damn disgrace

06:18.628 --> 06:20.835
of a naval aviator
who hasn't seen "Hell Divers."

06:20.839 --> 06:24.752
- Prepare to launch plane.
- Prepare to launch plane.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.343
We've completed our turn
into the wind, sir.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.057
We're ready to launch
on your word.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.597
Get the planes in the air.

06:36.605 --> 06:37.685
Aye, sir.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.390
- Yes, sir?
- Launch. Launch. Launch.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.641
Aye, aye, sir.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.324
Clear the flight deck.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.323
When we get back to Pearl,
I'll have to catch

06:54.331 --> 06:56.697
- that Hell Diver flick.
- You'll love it.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.539
You'll be using it to pick up
the clean girls in port

06:58.543 --> 06:59.543
before you know it.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.293
Can't wait.

07:02.297 --> 07:04.413
- Good hunting, Ramsay.
- Good hunting.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.717
Pilots, start your engine.

07:24.402 --> 07:27.269
- Morning, Lee.
- Morning, sir.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.278
Don't tell me you've been
sitting here since reveille.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.025
No, sir.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.869
Well... not entirely, sir.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.909
So you did
the preflight checks then?

07:46.299 --> 07:47.505
Twice, sir.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.251
Why twice?

07:51.262 --> 07:52.877
There's been
some mechanical problems

07:52.889 --> 07:54.425
with the SBDs this morning.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.047
I didn't want to be one of them.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.890
That's good thinking.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.259
I'd hate for us
to get all dressed up

07:59.270 --> 08:01.306
and have nowhere to go.

08:10.365 --> 08:11.946
Looks like we're up, sir.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.281
You ready?

08:14.661 --> 08:18.245
- I'm excited, sir.
- Just a little nervous.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.909
Yeah. That's totally healthy.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.248
I'll never forget
how nervous I was

08:22.252 --> 08:23.992
the first time
I did a night takeoff.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.667
You serious?

08:28.675 --> 08:30.666
You took off a carrier at night?

08:30.677 --> 08:32.417
Not exactly.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.419
A night takeoff is when
you throttle up off the deck

08:34.431 --> 08:35.716
with your eyes closed.

08:38.434 --> 08:39.434
Really?

08:40.562 --> 08:41.802
Sir?

08:41.813 --> 08:43.053
Hold on.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.689
This is always the worst part.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.309
Launch plane. Launch plane.

09:09.174 --> 09:11.877
Just remember,
if anything happens,

09:11.885 --> 09:14.627
don't panic, all right?

09:14.637 --> 09:16.377
If we end up in the drink
on the takeoff,

09:16.389 --> 09:17.799
there's a beautiful
destroyer there

09:17.807 --> 09:19.798
waiting to pick us up.

09:19.809 --> 09:20.969
Aye, sir.

09:29.027 --> 09:30.563
Here we go.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.910
Woo-hoo!

09:43.958 --> 09:45.368
What a thrill, huh?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.454
You'll always remember
your first time.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.125
Absolutely, sir.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.714
Be hell a lot better
once we see some Jap carriers.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.804
Falling into formation
with VB-6.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.687
Does it...

10:54.988 --> 10:57.400
Does it always take this long?

10:57.407 --> 10:59.193
No.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.861
That pompous ass Browning

11:00.869 --> 11:02.734
probably hasn't crawled
out of bed yet to give us

11:02.745 --> 11:03.745
the go-ahead.

11:04.831 --> 11:05.946
Yeah.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.203
I don't...

11:11.087 --> 11:13.669
It looks like more mechanicals
down there to me.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.833
Probably.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.923
But I like my version better.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.709
Either way,
it's better we're up here

11:19.721 --> 11:21.712
than down there.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.634
It's gonna be a shitty day
to push planes.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.256
You're damn right, sir.

11:26.561 --> 11:29.852
I'm... I'm ready for some action.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.812
As long as the Wildcats
are doing their job,

11:31.816 --> 11:34.148
we probably won't see
a whole lot.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.739
- Sir?
- I see it.

11:49.751 --> 11:50.740
And so does McClusky.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.084
Pulling into formation.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.839
Where...

12:47.850 --> 12:50.216
Where are the Wildcats
and Devastators at?

12:52.981 --> 12:54.721
Huh.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.814
Must be a no-frills operation.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.852
Don't worry.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.649
Brass knows what they're doing.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.739
If all else fails,
that's what those shiny guns

13:04.742 --> 13:06.198
are there for, right?

13:08.329 --> 13:10.069
Aye, sir.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.081
Please, dear Lord,

13:14.085 --> 13:15.925
let the brass know
what the hell they're doing.

13:49.454 --> 13:52.161
Sir. Look.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.625
Reducing altitude.

14:23.946 --> 14:24.946
Ah.

14:28.659 --> 14:29.694
Good news.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.077
We can come off the 02.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.617
Best is taking us in.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.289
Thank God.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.415
How long were we up there?

14:47.053 --> 14:48.589
About an hour and change.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.132
Oh.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.596
Yeah, an hour and change
of my face itching

14:52.600 --> 14:55.057
and my head swimming.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.722
Don't let one
of the heavy bomber boys

14:56.729 --> 14:58.594
hear you whining
about the 02 masks.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.346
They got to keep them on

15:00.358 --> 15:01.473
eight, twelve hours.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.099
Yeah.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.976
Better them than us, though.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.148
Maybe.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.942
Those big sons of bitches
certainly stay up

15:08.950 --> 15:10.531
a hell of a lot longer
than we do.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.157
I'll tell you,

15:16.165 --> 15:19.157
all that circling
and reduced altitude

15:19.168 --> 15:21.375
sure didn't do us any favors
in the fuel department.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.880
That's what I like
about you, sir.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.841
You always seem to find
the dark clouds inside the

15:28.845 --> 15:31.086
silver lining.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.462
Just keep your eyes
peeled for Japs

15:32.473 --> 15:33.508
and enjoy the flight.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.302
Aye, aye, sir.

15:46.571 --> 15:49.358
Hey, Vandivier, sir?

15:49.365 --> 15:50.400
Yeah.

15:50.408 --> 15:53.733
I got, uh... a stupid question,

15:53.744 --> 15:55.826
but it never came up
during gunnery training.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.695
It's about the plane.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.197
What's that?

15:59.208 --> 16:01.039
Where's the head?

16:02.545 --> 16:04.752
Does it look like
there's a head in this plane?

16:06.424 --> 16:08.506
No, sir.

16:08.509 --> 16:13.469
It's just that I've been staring
at this water for hours,

16:13.473 --> 16:16.135
and I had a bit too much coffee
this morning, that's all.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.678
Well, you have two options.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.971
You can either hold it,

16:19.979 --> 16:23.142
or if you look down
below your seat to the left,

16:23.149 --> 16:25.185
you'll see a tube.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.693
Found it!

16:29.697 --> 16:31.938
Be careful at this altitude.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.905
You don't want little Keaney
accidentally touching

16:33.910 --> 16:35.116
anything metal.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.831
- Know what?
- I think I'll just hold it.

16:45.838 --> 16:49.251
The mental image
just dried me up.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.931
What's going on?

16:58.935 --> 17:00.926
Best just turned his ship.

17:05.233 --> 17:08.316
- I'm seeing wake!
- I see it.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.819
- Best sees it too.
- He's taking us in.

17:15.826 --> 17:19.819
Now get your ears on and be
on the lookout for Zeros.

17:19.829 --> 17:21.616
VS-6 and VB-6,

17:21.624 --> 17:23.830
I have spotted
an enemy carrier group.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.744
Sir!

17:25.752 --> 17:29.120
McClusky is reporting
enemy carrier group sighted.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.213
This is it!

17:31.217 --> 17:32.252
What's our target?

17:33.844 --> 17:36.176
- Hold on, sir.
- I'm getting a lot of cross talk!

17:36.180 --> 17:37.966
Put it on.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.680
All divisions prepare
for attack.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.220
Carrier to the left.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.683
Best, you take the one
to the right.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.302
All divisions commence attack.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.849
Did you catch any of that?

17:45.856 --> 17:47.687
Sort of!

17:47.692 --> 17:50.024
What's our target,
the front or the back?

17:50.027 --> 17:51.517
I don't know!

17:57.743 --> 17:58.858
Shit.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.165
Wait, wait, wait!

18:06.168 --> 18:07.658
Best isn't diving!

18:07.670 --> 18:09.331
He's waggling his wings!

18:09.338 --> 18:10.623
Already committed!

18:10.631 --> 18:11.620
No. No, no, no!

18:11.632 --> 18:12.632
Hold on!

19:21.952 --> 19:24.785
Scratch one flattop!

19:24.789 --> 19:26.996
You okay back there?

19:26.999 --> 19:30.287
I seem to have urinated, sir!

19:30.294 --> 19:32.410
Stop bragging and guns up!

19:32.421 --> 19:35.288
We got more than soggy drawers
to worry about!

19:35.299 --> 19:37.164
Zeros incoming!

19:51.857 --> 19:54.064
Contacts!

19:54.068 --> 19:56.935
Three! I see three!

20:10.501 --> 20:12.958
Sir, they're getting closer!

20:12.962 --> 20:14.372
Well, discourage them!

20:14.380 --> 20:15.870
What?

20:15.881 --> 20:18.088
Shoot them
with the fucking guns!

20:27.268 --> 20:29.099
There's Zeros everywhere!

20:31.647 --> 20:33.854
Guess we found out
where their combat air patrols

20:33.858 --> 20:35.018
were hanging around.

20:39.655 --> 20:40.815
Two more!

20:40.823 --> 20:42.905
Three o'clock high!

20:42.908 --> 20:45.775
And they're really pissed off!

20:45.786 --> 20:47.447
Well, we did just sink
their carrier.

20:47.455 --> 20:48.661
What?

20:48.664 --> 20:50.825
Whose side are you on anyway?

20:50.833 --> 20:52.118
Hold them off of us!

20:53.586 --> 20:55.201
I'm dropping to the deck.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.543
You're gonna what?

20:56.547 --> 20:58.583
Go, go.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.758
I didn't sign up for this, sir!

21:06.766 --> 21:08.427
Oh, no! My God!

21:09.935 --> 21:11.391
Hold on, Lee!

21:11.395 --> 21:13.010
They're almost ripe for picking!

21:19.111 --> 21:21.443
We're hit! We're hit!

21:21.447 --> 21:22.527
Shit!

21:25.910 --> 21:28.071
You okay back there?

21:28.078 --> 21:30.160
Lee?

21:30.164 --> 21:32.450
Lee, you with me?

21:32.458 --> 21:33.664
I'm okay.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.534
I'm okay. I'm okay.

21:36.545 --> 21:37.876
You?

21:37.880 --> 21:41.087
- I'm rattled...
- but I'm not hurt.

21:41.091 --> 21:42.501
What's the damage?

21:44.470 --> 21:47.586
- I don't even...
- know where to begin.

21:48.724 --> 21:51.056
Oil pressure is dropping.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.891
I'm fighting the controls!

22:00.069 --> 22:02.560
How far are we from the "E"?

22:02.571 --> 22:04.027
I don't know!

22:04.031 --> 22:05.942
Far. Why?

22:05.950 --> 22:07.656
Fuel leak!

22:09.119 --> 22:10.700
Relay and transmit!

22:11.789 --> 22:12.904
Go!

22:12.915 --> 22:18.451
This is SBD... 6-B-14.

22:18.462 --> 22:20.578
Open tank and dead stick.

22:20.589 --> 22:23.877
We're making a water landing
10 miles west

22:23.884 --> 22:26.421
of enemy force.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.043
- Sent!
- Hold on.

22:29.515 --> 22:30.630
This is gonna be rough!

23:06.218 --> 23:08.209
What the hell?

23:08.220 --> 23:10.586
Which one of you jokers
glued my rations shut, huh?

23:11.640 --> 23:13.255
Oh, yeah. Very funny.

23:13.267 --> 23:16.100
Word of advice.
You all better sleep lightly.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.183
Yeah.

23:17.187 --> 23:18.427
Hey.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.104
Picking up some chatter.

23:21.108 --> 23:22.689
Did they get another flattop?

23:22.693 --> 23:24.809
- Yeah, hold your damn horses.
- I'm listening.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.613
It's chatter from some SBDs.

23:31.285 --> 23:33.605
They can't find their carrier,
and they're all low on fuel.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.662
Sounds like things
went a little pear shaped

23:37.666 --> 23:39.998
and now they're gonna
have to ditch in the sea.

23:40.002 --> 23:41.333
Which carrier
and how far from it?

23:41.337 --> 23:43.168
They didn't say.

23:43.172 --> 23:45.037
Japs could be listening,
I guess.

23:47.635 --> 23:49.751
Well, let's get in the air.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.627
- You got it.
- Nus, see if you can figure out

23:51.639 --> 23:53.175
where we think the Jap fleet was

23:53.182 --> 23:55.013
and where the carriers are.
Best guess.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.473
We'll see if we can find
these guys.

23:56.477 --> 23:58.013
Aye, sir.

23:58.020 --> 23:59.681
All right, boys, listen up.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.519
Lunch time's over.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.684
Mansfield,
report to Midway Station

24:03.692 --> 24:05.398
that we're gonna continue
our scouting operations

24:05.402 --> 24:06.983
- for Jap forces.
- On it.

24:06.987 --> 24:08.943
Nus, I want you to plot
a course in such a way

24:08.948 --> 24:10.609
that we might be able
to find one of these guys.

24:10.616 --> 24:11.856
- You got it.
- Mansfield,

24:11.867 --> 24:13.448
I want you to keep
those ears on, all right?

24:13.452 --> 24:15.113
I want you to write down
anything that you pick up...

24:15.120 --> 24:17.907
- Names, positions, anything.
- On it, sir.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.371
Nus, I need a heading
and waypoint soonest.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.206
- Uh-hmm.
- Smokey, let's go.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.451
Did you miss me?

24:24.463 --> 24:25.999
Always.

24:26.006 --> 24:27.086
Open the tail flaps.

24:27.091 --> 24:28.251
On it.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.249
Everybody's accounted for.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.340
Contact.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.676
All right, everybody,
heading out.

25:40.247 --> 25:41.737
Norman!

25:52.176 --> 25:54.007
Sir!

25:54.011 --> 25:55.342
Get out of the plane!

25:55.345 --> 25:56.676
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.471
- Get out!
- Fuck.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.100
Get out!

26:04.938 --> 26:06.599
Let's go! Let's go!

26:15.240 --> 26:17.652
- Come on!
- You ain't destroying.

26:20.788 --> 26:23.450
Shit! The raft! The raft!

26:23.457 --> 26:24.822
Shit!

26:31.173 --> 26:32.504
Fuck!

26:36.512 --> 26:37.718
Lee.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.211
Lee.

26:48.273 --> 26:51.432
- Did you think we...
- we got it, sir?

26:51.443 --> 26:53.183
You think we hit the flattop?

26:55.531 --> 26:56.941
Yeah.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.065
There's no way I missed.

26:59.076 --> 27:01.192
There's no way.

27:01.203 --> 27:04.536
Win-win, then. Yeah?

27:04.540 --> 27:05.700
Yeah.

27:05.707 --> 27:08.039
We stuck it to the Japs,

27:08.043 --> 27:09.408
and I don't have to clean up

27:09.419 --> 27:11.125
a piss-soaked
gunnery compartment.

27:22.307 --> 27:25.344
I'm sorry about the raft.

27:28.897 --> 27:29.977
It's okay.

27:32.401 --> 27:34.517
About a dozen planes
saw us go down.

27:36.405 --> 27:41.114
We'll just float here
and watch the show,

27:41.118 --> 27:43.484
and we'll get picked up
by breakfast.

27:45.414 --> 27:46.779
Breakfast, huh?

27:48.333 --> 27:51.825
What do you think
they'll be having?

27:51.837 --> 27:54.203
Shit on a shingle,
that's my favorite.

27:54.214 --> 27:55.670
What about you?

27:55.674 --> 27:57.210
Got to raise your standards,
Keaney.

27:59.261 --> 28:00.592
I'm thinking steak and lobster.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.596
Steak and lobster.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.340
Let me see that wound, - Yeah.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.889
I don't know. Oh.

28:11.565 --> 28:13.556
- All right.
- Let's get you patched up.

28:24.119 --> 28:27.452
All personnel,
incoming friendly aircraft.

28:38.425 --> 28:41.792
Incoming aircraft,
starboard, 301 on approach.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.801
Initial reports
are very promising, sir.

28:46.808 --> 28:47.968
We sunk three carriers.

28:50.354 --> 28:52.970
1400 hours, and enough time
to refuel, rearm,

28:52.981 --> 28:54.937
and send out a second sortie
to finish the job.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.069
We have men in the water.

29:01.073 --> 29:02.984
Yes, we do, sir.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.448
Sailor, did you see
that plane go down?

29:05.452 --> 29:06.862
- Aye, sir.
- Redirect the Phelps

29:06.870 --> 29:08.030
- to collect that crew.
- Aye sir,

29:08.038 --> 29:09.528
redirecting to Phelps.

29:09.539 --> 29:11.029
We've been very successful
so far, sir,

29:11.041 --> 29:12.656
but we can't let ourselves
be distracted

29:12.668 --> 29:14.158
with rescue missions.

29:14.169 --> 29:15.500
Successful?

29:15.504 --> 29:17.244
We launched 32 planes.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.746
All of six have returned.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.622
And that is unfortunate,

29:20.634 --> 29:23.091
but what an excellent ratio
of return for three carriers.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.302
Yorktown reporting
inbound enemy aircraft.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.045
Battle stations.
Battle stations.

29:27.057 --> 29:29.639
This complicates things a bit.

29:29.643 --> 29:31.759
I'm gonna go adjust the op plan.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.385
Unidentified aircraft inbound.

29:33.397 --> 29:35.012
Tell the bridge I'm on my way.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.979
- Aye, sir.
- All hands, general quarters.

29:36.984 --> 29:38.099
General quarters.

29:40.570 --> 29:42.435
That's what I'm telling you,
there isn't any

29:42.447 --> 29:44.654
radio navigation beacon
from anywhere but the island.

29:44.658 --> 29:46.614
Right. And then
so we use the island,

29:46.618 --> 29:49.200
find where we are, and then
where the enemy fleet is.

29:49.204 --> 29:51.320
Which we don't know
because they ain't filing

29:51.331 --> 29:53.162
no navigational plans with us.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.827
We know where they were,
so that's where we 're going.

29:54.835 --> 29:56.416
But we don't know
where our carriers are.

29:56.420 --> 29:57.956
How are we gonna triangulate

29:57.963 --> 29:59.499
with only two points
of reference?

29:59.506 --> 30:01.246
Bi-angulate,
is that even a thing?

30:01.258 --> 30:02.839
Just gonna have to go
in a search pattern.

30:02.843 --> 30:04.208
- Search pattern?
- T here's got to be,

30:04.219 --> 30:06.255
like, 200 miles of water.

30:06.263 --> 30:08.970
Every damn day.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.382
Pags, could you hop down here

30:12.394 --> 30:15.477
before I put my 45
in my mouth, please?

30:15.480 --> 30:16.765
You got it, sir.

30:20.986 --> 30:22.192
- All right.
- Why don't we just ask

30:22.195 --> 30:23.195
where to search?

30:24.781 --> 30:28.023
We're already outside
our mission search area.

30:28.035 --> 30:30.026
If we ask where to search,

30:30.037 --> 30:31.447
they're just gonna tell us
to search

30:31.455 --> 30:33.446
the mission search area.

30:33.457 --> 30:35.698
Besides, if the beacon's off,
they ain't gonna answer anyways.

30:35.709 --> 30:38.917
Christ, Mansfield, will you
shut up and make some coffee?

30:38.920 --> 30:41.457
Listening to you is making
everybody in this boat stupider.

30:41.465 --> 30:43.046
All right, Nusbaum,

30:43.050 --> 30:44.961
where's the enemy fleet's
last known?

30:44.968 --> 30:46.003
Right here.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.340
Right there?

30:49.348 --> 30:51.009
If we sunk three carriers,
we're gonna see smoke,

30:51.016 --> 30:53.473
we're gonna see debris,
we follow the party,

30:53.477 --> 30:55.468
we head back to Midway
in circles,

30:55.479 --> 30:57.060
we won't see any Jap carriers,

30:57.064 --> 30:59.476
but we might find
a pilot or two.

30:59.483 --> 31:02.316
- Good idea.
- I'm full of them.

31:02.319 --> 31:04.399
Be a doll, send the coffee up
when it's done, yeah?

31:11.787 --> 31:13.778
On deck, starboard 1.

31:13.789 --> 31:16.576
Leave the wheel and look out.

31:16.583 --> 31:19.290
The situation on Yorktown
is still developing,

31:19.294 --> 31:22.001
but they've taken at least
two torpedoes amidships

31:22.005 --> 31:23.996
and listing to port.

31:24.007 --> 31:26.464
Buckmaster's considering
abandoning her.

31:26.468 --> 31:28.083
That'll be up to Fletcher.

31:29.971 --> 31:31.711
What about her planes?

31:31.723 --> 31:33.509
They took a shellacking,
same as us.

31:33.517 --> 31:35.599
But luck would have it
Fletcher sent the remaining SBDs

31:35.602 --> 31:37.809
out on patrol
right before the attack.

31:37.813 --> 31:40.020
Well, obviously
there's a carrier or two

31:40.023 --> 31:41.888
still lurking about.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.607
Let the scouts find the enemy.

31:44.611 --> 31:47.273
McClusky did not have kind words
to say about Captain Browning.

31:47.280 --> 31:50.067
No, I don't expect he would.

31:51.618 --> 31:55.076
I want the planes on standby,
ready to go.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.741
Scouting 6 and the rest
of the Bomber remnants

31:56.748 --> 31:58.659
are being fit for action.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.033
Earl Gallaher is eager
to get in the fight.

32:01.044 --> 32:03.000
When the scouts find them,

32:03.004 --> 32:04.835
I want you to point the "E"
into the wind

32:04.840 --> 32:06.205
and get the planes in the sky.

32:06.216 --> 32:07.956
Aye, aye, sir.

32:07.968 --> 32:11.085
All stations report
when manned and ready.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.398
Hey, Bennett, sir,
turn to starboard 30 degrees.

32:24.401 --> 32:26.232
The guys are spotting
oil slicks and debris.

32:32.909 --> 32:34.695
Yeah, I see 'em too.

32:34.703 --> 32:36.989
All right, boys,
keep your eyes peeled.

32:36.997 --> 32:38.828
Look for anybody
happy to see us.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.428
Lee, wake up.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.174
Lee, get up.

33:00.729 --> 33:04.346
Lee, wake up, buddy.

33:04.357 --> 33:05.847
I got two more minutes left.

33:05.859 --> 33:08.020
Wake up, buddy, come on.

33:08.028 --> 33:10.895
Wait your turn.

33:13.617 --> 33:15.153
Sorry. Sorry.

33:15.160 --> 33:18.323
Sorry.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.330
I'm sorry.

33:22.792 --> 33:25.329
- Sorry.
- I was having a dream.

33:25.337 --> 33:28.374
I was in a bath

33:28.381 --> 33:30.042
with a beautiful Hawaiian girl.

33:32.761 --> 33:34.342
No kidding?

33:34.346 --> 33:37.921
It was hot... with bubbles.

33:41.937 --> 33:43.848
You're in a piss-warm
ocean with me.

33:46.191 --> 33:47.806
Let me get that patched up.

33:49.444 --> 33:50.980
No offense, sir...

33:53.323 --> 33:55.234
but I'd prefer my dream.

33:57.244 --> 33:59.235
I liked your dream better too.

34:00.705 --> 34:02.696
I'll have what you're having.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.292
Any sign of a pickup?

34:10.422 --> 34:13.960
No. I saw a few aircraft
flying overhead,

34:13.969 --> 34:17.302
but I think it was just a PBY.

34:17.304 --> 34:18.761
I don't know.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.474
No Japs out looking?

34:23.478 --> 34:25.184
No, we sunk their carriers.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.474
They got bigger problems.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.683
Well, the Japs never know

34:31.695 --> 34:34.732
when they've been licked,
though, so...

34:34.739 --> 34:37.071
we're gonna have to just sit
here tight for a while, okay?

34:37.074 --> 34:38.281
Okay.

34:41.621 --> 34:45.079
The aid kit went down
with everything else.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.447
We got to make do.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.873
It's fine
until the salt hits it,

34:51.880 --> 34:55.168
and then it burns down
to my fingers and toes.

34:55.176 --> 34:56.632
All right.

34:56.636 --> 34:58.251
I'm gonna tie it up
real tight, okay?

34:58.263 --> 34:59.343
- Okay.
- All right?

34:59.347 --> 35:01.383
- Okay.
- All right.

35:01.391 --> 35:03.677
All right. Here.

35:03.685 --> 35:05.516
Bite down on this.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.101
All right. All right.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.471
This is gonna sting
just a little.

35:09.482 --> 35:11.018
All right.

35:11.026 --> 35:13.768
All right on three, here we go.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.983
One, two.

35:20.744 --> 35:23.577
Aah!

35:31.129 --> 35:33.120
Okay. Is that better?

35:33.131 --> 35:34.667
Feel better?

35:34.674 --> 35:36.630
Mm-hmm.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.000
You okay?

35:46.394 --> 35:48.555
Think they'll let us go home
after this?

35:50.857 --> 35:54.149
I just... I just want to go home.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.612
I just want to see my mom again.

35:59.616 --> 36:01.572
You will.

36:01.576 --> 36:02.782
They'll send us home.

36:03.912 --> 36:09.581
A little shore leave,
we'll be good as new.

36:09.584 --> 36:11.074
They'll send us back...

36:12.837 --> 36:14.373
we'll have a parade.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.623
There'll be hula girls...

36:20.595 --> 36:22.927
poker chips.

36:22.931 --> 36:25.923
There'll be leis

36:25.934 --> 36:29.768
all the way down Hotel Street.

36:29.771 --> 36:31.227
It's gonna be great.

36:33.441 --> 36:37.308
First round... is on me.

36:37.320 --> 36:40.278
Nah, nah.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.772
To hell with that.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.240
First round's on McClusky.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.198
He owes us that much.

36:48.415 --> 36:49.575
Fine, then.

36:56.965 --> 36:58.455
Are those ours?

37:01.761 --> 37:04.719
Definitely. Definitely.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.588
At least 20 of them.

37:06.599 --> 37:08.135
Hey!

37:08.143 --> 37:10.099
Lee, Lee, Lee.

37:10.103 --> 37:11.309
Down here!

37:11.312 --> 37:12.312
Hey.

37:14.149 --> 37:16.105
Lee, Lee!

37:16.109 --> 37:17.645
They're too high.

37:19.654 --> 37:21.360
They can't hear us.
They can't see us.

37:22.532 --> 37:23.692
They can't hear us.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.949
They're probably too busy.

37:32.709 --> 37:34.916
Another flattop, you think?

37:34.919 --> 37:37.410
Yeah.

37:37.422 --> 37:38.707
I hope so.

37:48.391 --> 37:51.007
They got it.

37:51.019 --> 37:53.852
Yeah.

37:53.855 --> 37:55.345
They got it.

37:59.027 --> 38:02.815
- They got it.
- They got it.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.760
Holy Christ on a T-bone steak!

38:27.764 --> 38:29.470
Hey, boys, I think we got one.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.385
- English, Mansfield.
- Man in the water

38:31.392 --> 38:33.348
floating on his back.
We just flew over them.

38:33.353 --> 38:36.345
Boys are cheering
about needles in a haystack.

38:36.356 --> 38:38.142
- One of ours?
- Uh, it's hard to tell.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.980
Spread the word.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.849
Turn her around
and bring her down.

39:01.214 --> 39:03.580
It's a little too rough
to set down.

39:03.591 --> 39:05.582
Yeah,
I'm thinking the same thing.

39:05.593 --> 39:07.379
- Let's do over-under.
- Yeah.

39:07.387 --> 39:09.252
Not good. I just hope
we don't hit those swells

39:09.264 --> 39:10.754
like a sack of crap
against the wall.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.426
I'm not particularly comfortable

39:12.433 --> 39:13.923
- leaving that guy behind.
- Me, either.

39:13.935 --> 39:15.300
Just pointing out
we might not be taking off

39:15.311 --> 39:16.801
for a while once we pick him up.

39:16.813 --> 39:19.020
It'll give you a chance
to work on your tan.

39:19.023 --> 39:20.729
I'll let the boys know.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.849
All right, boys, listen up.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.397
Water is looking a little
rough down there.

39:24.404 --> 39:26.144
- Break.
- I got some bad news too.

39:26.155 --> 39:28.487
We got a bogey back here,
coming right up our tailpipe.

39:28.491 --> 39:30.948
- What is it?
- Don't know.

39:30.952 --> 39:32.817
It's flying slow,
might be a Dave.

39:32.829 --> 39:34.035
Oh, that's a biplane.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.448
Can you not tell
that's a biplane?

39:35.456 --> 39:37.321
- It's in and out of clouds.
- Hold on.

39:41.963 --> 39:44.204
It's a Zero. It's a Zero.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.751
- Nus, mark where we are.
- Got it.

39:45.758 --> 39:47.749
Mansfield, make yourself useful

39:47.760 --> 39:49.296
and drop that guy a boat
and some crackers.

39:49.304 --> 39:51.636
- Aye, aye.
- Everybody else hang on,

39:51.639 --> 39:54.426
whatever prayers you were
saving for a special occasion,

39:54.434 --> 39:55.844
now would be a good time
to use them.

39:55.852 --> 39:57.217
Oh, Jesus Christ.

39:57.228 --> 39:59.344
- I can't see him.
- Bogey coming on at six,

39:59.355 --> 40:01.186
- I can't get a bead on him.
- No. I can't...

40:01.190 --> 40:02.726
I don't know where he is,
I can't see him.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.454
- Smokey, you got him.
- He's gaining on us.

40:11.534 --> 40:13.320
How's that boat coming,
Mansfield?

40:13.328 --> 40:14.613
Working on it.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.577
Just make another pass.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.367
Boat's away, skipper. Not sure

40:18.374 --> 40:19.989
if we dropped it anywhere
near that poor bastard.

40:20.001 --> 40:21.832
That's why they invented
swimming, Mansfield.

40:21.836 --> 40:23.451
We may be racing him for it

40:23.463 --> 40:25.223
if we don't get the hell
away from that Zero.

40:29.969 --> 40:31.675
God damn it, where is he?

40:31.679 --> 40:33.340
I just spotted him
headed upstairs.

40:33.348 --> 40:35.555
That asshole's gonna hit us
from above.

40:35.558 --> 40:36.923
That's not good.

40:36.935 --> 40:38.891
All right, boys,
eyes to the skies.

40:38.895 --> 40:41.762
You see a meatball, you set
your sights right on him.

40:58.498 --> 41:01.285
- Whoo! He's breaking off!
- Way to go, Smokey!

41:01.292 --> 41:04.500
Hey you scared him off, Smokey.

41:04.504 --> 41:05.960
Champion machine gunner
of Honolulu,

41:05.964 --> 41:07.044
you're damn right I did.

41:10.385 --> 41:11.385
Skipper.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.210
We took a few rounds
in the wings,

41:14.222 --> 41:16.053
maybe a pontoon.

41:16.057 --> 41:17.763
We should check it out
while we still got sunlight.

41:17.767 --> 41:19.177
Set us down, yeah?

41:19.185 --> 41:21.676
I'll get some distance
to put her down.

41:21.688 --> 41:23.224
Banks, you okay?

41:23.231 --> 41:24.596
Yeah.

41:24.607 --> 41:26.313
Got any clean drawers
back there?

41:26.317 --> 41:28.057
I'll take a look.

41:28.069 --> 41:30.105
Hey, Champion Machine Gunner
of Honolulu

41:30.113 --> 41:31.603
ain't got dick to do with that.

41:31.614 --> 41:33.445
That Zero had us dead to rights.

41:33.449 --> 41:35.656
He chose to go play
somewhere else in a real hurw.

41:35.660 --> 41:38.072
Oh, yeah, we know.

41:38.079 --> 41:39.944
But let Smokey have his moment.

41:39.956 --> 41:41.196
If you say so.

42:13.281 --> 42:15.488
What's that noise?

42:15.491 --> 42:17.277
I don't know.

42:19.579 --> 42:23.288
Maybe a ship alarm.

42:23.291 --> 42:26.158
It sounds that,
kind of, funny on the water.

42:26.169 --> 42:29.585
Sound travels real
far, and I'm not sure.

42:31.049 --> 42:33.005
I wish it would stop.

42:33.009 --> 42:35.091
Yeah. Me, too.

42:44.479 --> 42:45.514
Sir.

42:47.523 --> 42:48.808
Norman.

42:50.610 --> 42:51.816
What?

42:51.819 --> 42:53.980
Call me Norman.

42:57.075 --> 42:58.315
Norman.

42:58.326 --> 42:59.326
Yeah.

43:02.371 --> 43:04.157
I'm thirsty.

43:04.165 --> 43:05.871
Me, too.

43:08.169 --> 43:11.002
I guess we know what
the Ancient Mariner felt like.

43:11.005 --> 43:12.461
Who?

43:14.175 --> 43:17.042
It's a poem.

43:17.053 --> 43:20.261
It's about this sailor
who shoots an albatross.

43:21.516 --> 43:23.381
This bird leads him
out of the Arctic,

43:23.392 --> 43:26.759
and he shoots it
with a crossbow.

43:29.065 --> 43:30.930
Well, why did he do that?

43:33.361 --> 43:36.649
You know,
it's not particularly clear

43:36.656 --> 43:38.396
why he does it in the poem.

43:40.034 --> 43:42.366
The rest of the crew
gets pissed at him

43:42.370 --> 43:44.907
because they thought the bird
brought the wind with it.

43:47.542 --> 43:51.706
They tied this albatross
around the neck of the sailor.

43:51.712 --> 43:54.875
He wears this
rotting bird around,

43:54.882 --> 43:57.544
hoping it'll bring back
the wind with his suffering,

43:57.552 --> 44:00.259
but it doesn't come.

44:03.766 --> 44:06.303
Instead, the crew
starts dying one by one...

44:08.646 --> 44:10.728
until he's the sole survivor.

44:13.151 --> 44:15.142
I know it doesn't sound
like a good story,

44:15.153 --> 44:21.069
but it's a parable of sorts.

44:24.537 --> 44:27.779
In the end, this poor bastard
suffers and suffers.

44:29.208 --> 44:34.252
In his suffering,
he's redeemed by God

44:34.255 --> 44:35.791
and rescued.

44:44.515 --> 44:45.721
Hang in there, Lee.

44:48.352 --> 44:49.512
You're gonna be okay.

44:52.190 --> 44:54.101
We both are.

45:23.596 --> 45:25.132
Admiral, sir.

45:25.139 --> 45:26.720
Good morning, Captain Browning.

45:26.724 --> 45:28.430
Last night, the submarine Tambor

45:28.434 --> 45:31.096
reported the location
and bearing of several contacts.

45:31.103 --> 45:33.765
I can send word to Commanders
McClusky and Gallaher

45:33.773 --> 45:36.139
to ready their pilots
to launch at first light.

45:36.150 --> 45:37.981
Let them sleep.

45:37.985 --> 45:39.771
Midway has their scouts
in the air,

45:39.779 --> 45:42.691
and if that turns out
to be a landing force,

45:42.698 --> 45:46.031
we will need to stay put
to cover the island.

45:46.035 --> 45:47.946
And if it is a fifth carrier?

45:47.954 --> 45:51.495
We will engage,
once we get confirmation.

45:51.499 --> 45:58.211
I will not make the same mistake
as yesterday and overextend.

45:58.214 --> 45:59.670
Yes, sir.

46:29.829 --> 46:31.785
Oh, good.

46:31.789 --> 46:33.905
They remembered my wake-up call.

46:35.459 --> 46:37.996
I haven't seen
the room service to...

46:38.004 --> 46:39.710
bring me my pancakes,

46:39.714 --> 46:41.329
orange juice... Lee, Lee.

46:41.340 --> 46:43.797
Lee! Lee!

46:45.094 --> 46:47.631
Lee!

46:53.811 --> 46:57.019
Don't go running off on me
like that, Lee.

46:57.023 --> 46:58.604
Scared the crap out of me.

46:58.607 --> 47:02.229
You know me, always running off

47:02.236 --> 47:04.568
chasing tail.

47:04.572 --> 47:07.439
- Yeah?
- You found some tail out here?

47:08.743 --> 47:09.903
Mermaid.

47:14.206 --> 47:15.412
Let me check that wound.

47:15.416 --> 47:17.828
Hmm. It's okay.

47:17.835 --> 47:18.835
I'm okay.

47:20.963 --> 47:23.921
No, it's fine.
It's getting better.

47:23.924 --> 47:26.711
Let me check
the damn wound, Lee.

47:35.978 --> 47:37.218
Yeah. You're right.

47:38.981 --> 47:40.016
It is getting better.

47:41.734 --> 47:43.019
I told you.

47:53.621 --> 47:55.452
Keep those eyes open, all right?

47:57.124 --> 48:00.036
I need you to help me
spot our pickup.

48:00.044 --> 48:03.127
I'm no good without my coffee.

48:03.130 --> 48:04.791
So I'm counting on you.

48:04.799 --> 48:06.414
I'm on it.

48:06.425 --> 48:07.665
I'm on it, sir.

48:24.360 --> 48:26.021
- You got to be cheating.
- You beat me four times.

48:26.028 --> 48:27.484
The odds are not in your favor.

48:27.488 --> 48:28.978
- Caroll, you...
- Good morning, fellas.

48:28.989 --> 48:30.900
- Morning, Nus.
- Morning, Nus,

48:30.908 --> 48:32.398
The boys watered and fed?

48:32.410 --> 48:34.446
- Aye, sir.
- You ready for another day

48:34.453 --> 48:35.818
of being shot at by Zeros?

48:35.830 --> 48:37.320
- Nope.
- Hell, nope.

48:37.331 --> 48:39.822
- All right.
- Well, boner appetite.

48:42.128 --> 48:44.835
Okay. This... Are you even...

48:44.839 --> 48:46.295
- Do you even hear it?
- Hey,

48:46.298 --> 48:48.505
NAS Midway
just sent orders our way.

48:48.509 --> 48:51.000
We're to scout and report
any and all enemy surface ships

48:51.011 --> 48:54.595
we come in contact with.
Relay positions.

48:54.598 --> 48:56.509
We're already doing that.

48:56.517 --> 48:57.927
And now we're still doing it,

48:57.935 --> 49:01.177
and we got a search area
defined.

49:01.188 --> 49:03.179
All right. Well, tell the boys
to weigh anchor.

49:03.190 --> 49:07.024
And, Nus, you just...

49:07.027 --> 49:09.063
just keep on doing your thing.

49:23.377 --> 49:25.288
Okay. Here we go.

49:25.296 --> 49:27.127
Possible main body fleet sighted

49:27.131 --> 49:29.213
700 miles, 92 degrees off Midway

49:29.216 --> 49:31.502
bearing 262 degrees.

49:31.510 --> 49:33.501
Two carriers,
four light cruisers,

49:33.512 --> 49:35.218
two heavies, six destroyers,

49:35.222 --> 49:36.712
eight troop transporters.

49:57.703 --> 50:00.160
- Sharks. Sharks.
- What?

50:00.164 --> 50:01.404
Where?

50:01.415 --> 50:03.531
- Where?
- It's behind you.

50:06.420 --> 50:07.535
Oh, God.

50:07.546 --> 50:08.546
Please, no, please.

50:13.177 --> 50:14.963
- It's a ray.
- A ray shark?

50:16.222 --> 50:17.632
No.

50:17.640 --> 50:19.801
Manta ray.

50:19.808 --> 50:22.174
Does it eat humans?

50:24.438 --> 50:26.053
Not that I'm aware of.

50:29.026 --> 50:31.233
They're all over
the waters off Pearl.

50:33.155 --> 50:35.066
When we get back,
I'll take you snorkeling,

50:35.074 --> 50:38.282
and you can see one up close.

50:43.541 --> 50:45.782
Thank you.

50:45.793 --> 50:49.831
But I respectfully... decline.

50:53.175 --> 50:54.790
You see,

50:54.802 --> 51:00.388
I just saw one
too close for comfort,

51:00.391 --> 51:03.053
and I think I'm gonna
swear off all things.

51:03.060 --> 51:05.642
H20 after this.

51:05.646 --> 51:07.227
You say that now,

51:07.231 --> 51:10.598
but no one likes a landlubber.

51:12.278 --> 51:13.518
Hey.

51:16.490 --> 51:20.199
I'm from Sandusky, okay?

51:21.537 --> 51:24.870
Grew up on Erie.

51:26.250 --> 51:32.286
Nobody...
is gonna call me a landlubber...

51:34.008 --> 51:38.834
not even you... sir.

51:40.347 --> 51:43.589
That's a lake, Keaney.

51:43.601 --> 51:45.512
It doesn't count.

51:48.564 --> 51:51.476
Aren't you from Mississippi?

51:52.693 --> 51:53.728
Huh?

51:53.736 --> 51:55.692
River boy.

51:55.696 --> 51:57.527
Hell, no.

51:57.531 --> 51:59.863
I'm from Hawaii.

51:59.867 --> 52:02.108
And so are you, if anybody asks.

52:03.370 --> 52:04.655
Yeah.

52:06.457 --> 52:07.492
Well...

52:09.043 --> 52:10.499
aloha.

52:14.757 --> 52:16.247
That's the spirit.

52:18.052 --> 52:19.792
Now where were we?

52:41.659 --> 52:43.900
Obviously you don't understand.

52:43.911 --> 52:46.653
Let me try and explain it
again in simpler terms.

52:46.664 --> 52:48.495
Suicide Mission.

52:48.499 --> 52:51.707
Earl and I did the math
the second we got these orders.

52:51.710 --> 52:53.701
Gentlemen, clear the room.

53:03.806 --> 53:05.888
Commander McClusky,
is there a problem?

53:05.891 --> 53:07.552
They're objecting
to the mission, sir.

53:07.559 --> 53:09.800
Apparently,
a heavily damaged carrier

53:09.812 --> 53:11.302
with no ability
to launch aircraft

53:11.313 --> 53:12.849
is proving to be
a formidable foe.

53:12.856 --> 53:14.471
Maybe so,

53:14.483 --> 53:16.849
but I believe I was asking
Commander McClusky.

53:16.860 --> 53:20.523
He has us flying 240 miles
to the target

53:20.531 --> 53:22.317
with thousand-pound bombs.

53:22.324 --> 53:24.155
The ordinance is to assure
destruction of the target.

53:24.159 --> 53:26.024
Lugging a thousand pounder
that far,

53:26.036 --> 53:28.573
you're sentencing those men
to ditch in the sea.

53:28.580 --> 53:30.696
We don't have enough gas
to get home.

53:30.708 --> 53:32.619
Per the specs of the Dauntless,

53:32.626 --> 53:34.662
you'll have enough fuel
to complete the mission.

53:34.670 --> 53:37.537
Sure, if the carrier
sits there quietly

53:37.548 --> 53:39.379
and allow us to slowly fly up,

53:39.383 --> 53:43.133
drop our payload,
and slowly fly away,

53:43.137 --> 53:45.002
but what the hell
are the chances of that?

53:46.932 --> 53:48.638
Commander McClusky
and the pilots

53:48.642 --> 53:50.473
know the planes
better than anyone.

53:50.477 --> 53:54.015
And I'm as eager as the next guy
to sink another carrier,

53:54.022 --> 53:57.810
but not at the expense
of more men in the water.

53:57.818 --> 53:59.558
Re-work the plan?

53:59.570 --> 54:02.812
Allow the planes
to land on the deck,

54:02.823 --> 54:04.688
not the ocean.

54:07.536 --> 54:08.536
Aye, sir.

54:14.460 --> 54:15.950
Get your men ready for action.

54:15.961 --> 54:18.418
- Thank you, sir.
- Yes, sir.

54:35.731 --> 54:37.187
No.

54:39.318 --> 54:41.354
No. No.

54:41.361 --> 54:43.352
I'm here, Lee.

54:43.363 --> 54:44.398
I'm here.

54:49.912 --> 54:50.992
I don't wanna...

54:59.254 --> 55:05.716
I don't... I don't wanna...
be in the...

55:05.719 --> 55:08.335
In the water anymore.

55:12.059 --> 55:13.515
I don't, either.

55:14.895 --> 55:19.684
I can't... I can't wait anymore.

55:25.155 --> 55:26.986
- He-help me.
- All right.

55:30.327 --> 55:33.034
- I'm trying to, Lee.
- I'm trying to.

55:34.706 --> 55:38.415
What can I do so you don't drop?

55:38.418 --> 55:39.954
Please tell me.

55:43.173 --> 55:45.789
God, I wanna... I wanna go.

55:50.722 --> 55:53.054
Come on, Lee,
just hang in there, man.

55:53.058 --> 55:55.094
Just hang in there, buddy.

55:55.102 --> 55:56.512
Just hang in there.

55:58.188 --> 56:00.224
I-I need to go.

56:01.400 --> 56:03.061
Just hang in there.

56:07.781 --> 56:09.362
I don't need to wait.

56:09.366 --> 56:14.109
Back home... to my mom.

56:24.715 --> 56:26.751
Don't leave me. Don't.

57:02.169 --> 57:04.831
- Hey.
- Is anybody else seeing this?

57:04.838 --> 57:07.375
Yep! Looks like
a couple dozen SBDs

57:07.382 --> 57:09.338
and some Wildcats.

57:09.343 --> 57:10.332
Guess they found those carriers

57:10.344 --> 57:12.175
they're looking for.

57:12.179 --> 57:14.010
I think that's our cue
to go back to Midway.

57:14.014 --> 57:15.629
Fuel's looking a little low.

57:15.641 --> 57:18.348
We got some Jerry cans
left with gas,

57:18.352 --> 57:20.058
but showers and real chow

57:20.062 --> 57:22.144
are sounding mighty
good right about now.

57:22.147 --> 57:25.105
- Yes, sir.
- Let's come around and head home.

57:44.628 --> 57:45.628
Lee.

57:46.838 --> 57:47.838
Look.

57:49.049 --> 57:51.040
Lee, they're gonna fly
right over us.

57:53.553 --> 57:54.593
Lee, they're gonna see us.

57:56.181 --> 57:57.967
Hey.

57:57.975 --> 58:00.887
Hey. Help!

58:00.894 --> 58:02.509
Help!

58:02.521 --> 58:05.558
We're down here! Hey.

58:05.565 --> 58:07.521
Help.

58:07.526 --> 58:09.391
We're down here! Help!

58:15.575 --> 58:17.907
They saw us, Lee.

58:17.911 --> 58:20.368
They had to.

58:20.372 --> 58:21.862
They flew right over us.

58:24.126 --> 58:26.037
Good. Good.

58:28.505 --> 58:29.505
Good.

58:34.678 --> 58:37.294
No, no, no, no.

58:37.305 --> 58:38.420
Lee.

58:38.432 --> 58:39.592
Hey. We're going home.

58:39.599 --> 58:41.305
We're going home.

58:41.309 --> 58:43.516
We're going home now.

58:43.520 --> 58:45.727
We're going back.

58:45.731 --> 58:46.846
Come on.

58:46.857 --> 58:48.688
Come on. Get up.

58:48.692 --> 58:50.978
Get up. We're okay.

58:50.986 --> 58:51.986
We're okay.

58:54.781 --> 58:57.147
Lee, we're safe.

58:57.159 --> 58:58.319
We're going home.

59:01.580 --> 59:03.662
Look, Lee. Please.

59:16.470 --> 59:18.085
Lee, I'm sorry.

59:20.474 --> 59:21.930
Don't leave me alone, Lee.

59:21.933 --> 59:24.219
Don't leave me out here alone.

59:44.956 --> 59:46.617
Next TAG up at 2130.

59:46.625 --> 59:47.614
Thank you, Petty Officer.

59:47.626 --> 59:48.741
Yes, sir.

59:50.670 --> 59:52.501
Admiral on the bridge!

59:52.506 --> 59:54.167
Henson,

59:54.174 --> 59:56.460
- turn on the running lights.
- Belay that.

59:56.468 --> 59:59.835
Admiral, we cannot turn on
the running lights.

59:59.846 --> 01:00:01.882
These waters are thick
with Japanese submarines.

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:03.130
We'd be broadcasting
our location

01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:04.426
to every eye for miles around.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:05.719
Including our pilots.

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:07.934
Who are not experienced

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:10.099
or trained to land
on a carrier in the dark.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:15.525
Henson, light the whole ship up.

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:17.520
Yes, sir.

01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:19.021
Petty Officer,

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:20.988
light the ship
full deck and bow.

01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:22.528
Summon the Captain
to the bridge.

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:23.536
Yes, sir.

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:27.453
Henry, light the ship
full deck and bow.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.493
Yes, everything.

01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:39.503
There they are. Thank God.

01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:47.974
I hope you realize
what you're doing.

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:51.937
I'm giving our pilots a chance
to land rather than crash.

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:54.682
Thank you for your advice,
Mr. Browning.

01:00:54.693 --> 01:00:56.024
You are dismissed.

01:00:58.655 --> 01:00:59.655
Good night.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:02.860
Good night, sir.

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:13.375
Okay, sailors,
keep your eyes open.

01:01:13.378 --> 01:01:15.869
We have planes
struggling to get home.

01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:36.272
Looks like the island
took a few licks.

01:01:36.276 --> 01:01:38.107
At least the dock's still here.

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:41.194
Yeah. It would be
damn easy to find,

01:01:41.198 --> 01:01:42.779
even without a radio beacon.

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:46.699
I think even some
of the airfield was on fire.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:50.867
Eh, the island was a shit hole
even before the Japs anyway.

01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:52.284
It looks like
we're all tied down.

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:54.453
You boys need anything else
from me?

01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:56.873
No. I think we're good.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.791
We're just gonna see
what the skinny is

01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:00.163
on the situation.

01:02:00.175 --> 01:02:02.291
Go get yourself some grub.

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:03.963
I wouldn't want to miss
Smokey's story

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:06.336
how he took on the whole
Jap Navy on his own, right?

01:02:06.348 --> 01:02:08.885
I expect the full reenactment
from you.

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:10.598
Yes, sir.

01:02:10.602 --> 01:02:12.388
Gentlemen. Boys. Skip.

01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:17.981
Boys, see you in the AM.

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:20.066
Sir. Good to see you.

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:23.152
- Sir.
- Good evening, chief.

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:24.646
We've been out sightseeing.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:26.899
- We miss anything big?
- Not really.

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.400
Just a little trouble
with the neighbors next door.

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:29.821
Hmm, those little guys

01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:31.239
with the bad
decision-making skills?

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:32.658
Yeah. Them's the ones.

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:35.578
So what the hell happened here?

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:37.792
Eh, the airfield's wrecked,

01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:39.582
but it could've been held
a lot worse.

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:42.205
The Marines flew every fighter
they could get in the air

01:02:42.217 --> 01:02:44.082
and messed up
their formation up there,

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:45.334
chased them off.

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:46.460
They haven't been back since.

01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:48.462
And the more current events?

01:02:48.473 --> 01:02:50.680
That's a mixed bag
of good, bad, and FUBAR.

01:02:50.684 --> 01:02:52.675
It sounds about par
for the course.

01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:55.928
The good news is the Navy
scratched four Jap flattops.

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:58.305
Bad news is the Yorktown
got blown to shit.

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:01.353
She's still afloat,
but that's about it.

01:03:01.361 --> 01:03:02.692
And the FUBAR?

01:03:02.696 --> 01:03:05.187
Carrier planes were slaughtered

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:07.439
after they dropped their bombs,

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.236
especially the ones
from the Enterprise.

01:03:09.244 --> 01:03:10.825
How bad?

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:12.615
Let's just say that there's
not enough pilots

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:14.453
left on the Big "E"
to field a baseball team.

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:17.164
You know, we were in the thick
of it earlier,

01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:19.159
and we saw plenty of SBDs
in the air then.

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:21.035
Those were Hornet
and Yorktown birds

01:03:21.047 --> 01:03:22.457
flying off Enterprise.

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:27.004
Are you okay, sir?

01:03:27.012 --> 01:03:31.796
Uh, yeah, I'm... okay.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:33.298
Thanks for the info, chief.

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:34.971
- You got it.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:40.430
Got it covered here?

01:03:40.442 --> 01:03:41.852
All right. Take it easy.

01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:49.193
Sailor, make fast these lines.

01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:07.248
Are you all right there,
skipper?

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:10.172
Um, yeah.

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:15.553
I have a lot of friends
on the Enterprise.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.893
Half of them were in my class
in Pensacola.

01:04:18.897 --> 01:04:20.012
Is that right?

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:21.308
Yeah.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:28.316
Tom Schneider, Frank
Weber, Bill Ramsay...

01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:31.698
Norman Vandivier.

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:34.363
- Vandivier?
- Yeah.

01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:36.783
No. I know Vandivier.

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:39.623
He and I got into some, uh,
disagreements

01:04:39.626 --> 01:04:40.866
over darts and billiards

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:42.208
back in the good old days
at Pearl.

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:43.873
Yeah?

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.587
Back in the good old days
before the Japs bombed us?

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:51.303
Yeah.

01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:59.013
Didn't know you two were
in the same class together.

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.806
How did you guys become friends?

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:06.141
- Um...
- well, it was a positively frigid

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:09.019
Florida Christmas afternoon.

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:10.816
We had just been given
holiday shore leave,

01:05:10.824 --> 01:05:13.440
and, like all good pilot cadets,

01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:15.237
we ended up at the closest bar

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:17.406
to celebrate
the spirit of the season.

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:20.121
- A time-honored tradition.
- Oh, yeah.

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:21.456
The place was packed.

01:05:21.459 --> 01:05:22.915
There were aviators everywhere,

01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:27.162
and, as it happens
in such situations,

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:29.960
me and old Norman, well,

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:32.459
we got to know each other
the old-fashioned way.

01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:36.179
- Bar fight?
- No.

01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:37.513
Whiskey, a little sugar,

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:41.972
- You're a goddamn laugh riot.
- You know that?

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.813
- Hey. It's true. It's true.
- Yeah. We hit it off.

01:05:44.816 --> 01:05:46.932
We had plans to do our time

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:48.899
and then fly
beautiful, rich women

01:05:48.903 --> 01:05:51.144
around the globe in a seaplane.

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:54.616
Globe?

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.623
Of course he's gonna scare
the hell out of the passengers

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:07.664
if he brings his dive bomber
experience to the endeavor.

01:06:07.672 --> 01:06:09.333
So I'm thinking you make
a better flight engineer

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.921
- at this point.
- Yep.

01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:14.292
Which means you can have
the co-pilot seat

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:15.760
if you can still stand me
after the war.

01:06:15.763 --> 01:06:17.719
What about Pags?

01:06:17.724 --> 01:06:20.261
We'll need a stewardess.

01:06:21.936 --> 01:06:23.517
0h, Christ.

01:06:23.521 --> 01:06:25.352
Shit, man.

01:06:28.568 --> 01:06:30.729
It wasn't supposed to happen
like this,

01:06:30.737 --> 01:06:32.944
everything going to shit
in one day.

01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:34.653
Those Dauntless bombers
are tough.

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:36.648
We've seen them hit rough seas
at a hundred knots,

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:38.820
and the pilot and gunner
swim out without a scratch.

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:40.193
They've been out there
for three days,

01:06:40.205 --> 01:06:42.116
and we're taking hot showers.

01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:44.083
We should be out there
looking for them right now.

01:06:44.959 --> 01:06:48.201
It's night. We're not gonna
find them in the dark.

01:06:50.965 --> 01:06:53.047
Take a look at all
the bullet holes in our wings

01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:55.087
and all that's gonna happen
tomorrow morning.

01:06:55.094 --> 01:06:56.550
Just doesn't feel right.

01:07:02.143 --> 01:07:04.134
Look, 90 get some chow
and a stiff drink.

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:05.726
I'll go report in,

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:08.142
see if I can't pump the RMs
for some intel.

01:07:08.149 --> 01:07:10.731
Maybe they'll know where
some of these guys went down.

01:07:10.735 --> 01:07:13.192
All right. But I'm serious.

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:14.857
I want to be in the air
the second we're cleared.

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:17.025
I hear you.

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:18.694
I'll see what I can do
on the clearance side.

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:20.191
You get everybody drunk

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:22.364
and convince them
to sleep on the boat.

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:23.487
Deal.

01:07:23.498 --> 01:07:25.284
Thanks, Caroll.

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:27.282
I mean it.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:30.626
Aw, skipper,
getting me all misty eyed.

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:51.473
I always wanted to be a pilot.

01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:55.602
I wanted to see the whole world.

01:07:58.032 --> 01:07:59.943
So I joined the Navy.

01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:06.363
When I went to Hawaii,

01:08:06.374 --> 01:08:09.787
I knew that I was in paradise.
I never wanted to leave.

01:08:13.673 --> 01:08:17.416
Was gonna do my time
for Uncle Sam,

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:20.794
fly around beautiful women
to exotic places.

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.596
This was not
how it was supposed to be.

01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:39.938
Still, there are worse places to die.

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:47.286
Crystal clear ocean

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:49.451
under the beautiful stars...

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:53.037
with a friend.

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:39.880
See you on the other side, Lee.

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:42.185
- Admiral.
- Hmm.

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:44.027
Hornet reports completion
of their sortie,

01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:46.488
having struck two heavy cruisers
with thousand-pound bombs.

01:10:46.492 --> 01:10:48.949
That's good. Launch two scouts
to take photographs

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:51.069
of what remains
to the Japanese fleet.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.490
Aye, sir.

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:54.989
George, any thoughts?

01:10:55.001 --> 01:10:56.741
We are running low on fuel,

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:59.085
and we'll need to slow
to allow the Oilers to catch us.

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:01.625
When does Wake become a threat?

01:11:01.632 --> 01:11:03.497
On our current course,

01:11:03.509 --> 01:11:06.876
we could potentially be in range
of their land-based aircraft

01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:08.219
by sometime this evening.

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:13.557
I don't feel the need to risk
any more lives or planes

01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:16.394
to sink two heavily damaged
Japanese ships.

01:11:16.397 --> 01:11:18.012
I concur.

01:11:19.233 --> 01:11:21.098
Remain on course at speed

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:23.317
till we collect our planes,

01:11:23.321 --> 01:11:25.232
- and then break our pursuit.
- Aye, sir.

01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:28.356
Sir, perhaps...

01:11:32.997 --> 01:11:33.997
Aye, sir.

01:11:44.759 --> 01:11:48.047
And there was a Jap flag
painted on the bullet shield.

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:50.136
- What the hell?
- No, like a... like a kill.

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:51.925
Like, how the Wildcat pilots
paint kills

01:11:51.933 --> 01:11:54.549
on the nose of their planes?
It was like that.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.175
- Huh.
- Yeah, so,

01:11:56.187 --> 01:11:57.893
apparently,
the Japs hit a hangar,

01:11:57.897 --> 01:11:59.728
took out a few planes
on the ground.

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:01.438
Some Marine dumb-ass

01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:03.353
lugged one
of the salvaged dual fifties

01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:05.443
from, uh, one of the planes
over by the latrines

01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:06.686
and set up shop.

01:12:06.697 --> 01:12:08.233
Shot down a Zero.

01:12:08.241 --> 01:12:09.697
Crashed on Sand Island.

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:10.985
Bullshit.

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.949
Hand to God. Saw it myself.

01:12:12.954 --> 01:12:14.740
Mansfield, Nusbaum,

01:12:14.747 --> 01:12:16.908
- focus on the job.
- Aye, sir.

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:18.622
- Sorry, skipper.
- We 're on course.

01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:20.162
We have a fair amount
of mileage to eat up

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.534
before we course change.

01:12:21.546 --> 01:12:22.831
Keep me posted.

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:31.761
Look, I'm sorry.

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:33.379
I'm still sorry.

01:12:34.559 --> 01:12:36.891
Not your fault.

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:38.976
Well, certainly seems
like my fault.

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.345
We were the first plane back.

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:43.814
She's... bad luck, I guess.

01:12:43.818 --> 01:12:46.059
We didn't have to be first back.

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:47.435
I could have checked it
in the morning,

01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:48.902
but I was so eager
to get clearance.

01:12:48.906 --> 01:12:51.363
That's all right, Caroll.

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:52.402
It's all right.

01:12:57.248 --> 01:12:59.364
Apparently,
Pappy Cole found a TBD pilot

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:01.240
in the water yesterday, so...

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:04.619
I'm sure they're gonna be fine.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:08.046
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:12.377
Still, it feels
like a bullshit order.

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:15.130
You mean the bullshit order
that has us following

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:17.302
a crippled Japanese fleet
back to Wake Island

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:19.551
with no intention or capability
of actually attacking it?

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:22.724
Yeah.

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:24.848
What, you don't think this is
a damn fine use of our time?

01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:27.396
I mean, what if these damaged
battle-wagons leaking oil

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:29.610
and traveling at about 15 knots
in gentle waters,

01:13:29.614 --> 01:13:31.946
somehow by the grace of God,
turned around,

01:13:31.949 --> 01:13:33.439
made a run from Midway?

01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:38.577
I'm sorry, skip.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.001
You have control?

01:13:49.008 --> 01:13:50.418
I have controls.

01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:01.930
Just fly the damn plane.

01:14:03.064 --> 01:14:04.395
Don't worry about it, man.

01:14:58.786 --> 01:14:59.786
Please.

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:02.911
Please.

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:23.070
Skip, they see us now.

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:24.660
What, they raise a flag
or something?

01:16:24.663 --> 01:16:26.403
No, watch. They're zigging.

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.622
I bet they think we're spotting
for a sub or something.

01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:31.914
I wish. Nus, you think
they're changing destination?

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:34.663
No way, skipper. There's
nowhere else for them to go.

01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:36.504
I wish they'd get to where
they're going in a hurry.

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:38.465
They are crawling.

01:16:38.469 --> 01:16:40.881
Yeah, they got damaged ships
they're attending.

01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:43.425
Fleet's only as fast
as the slowest ship, after all.

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:46.139
Well, get comfy, then,
because at this rate,

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:48.054
we've got a long flight
ahead of us.

01:16:48.062 --> 01:16:49.427
You have controls?

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:51.645
I have controls.

01:16:56.362 --> 01:16:58.478
I'm gonna get some shuteye.

01:16:58.489 --> 01:16:59.489
Hey.

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:02.152
Sweet dreams, Sally.

01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:51.701
Ah ha ha!

01:17:56.213 --> 01:17:57.749
Fuck!

01:17:57.756 --> 01:18:00.589
Fuck you, ocean!

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:02.834
Aah!

01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:37.496
Pew.

01:18:41.091 --> 01:18:42.091
Boom.

01:18:44.094 --> 01:18:45.925
Pew.

01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:46.930
Gotcha.

01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:00.857
Pew.

01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:04.527
Pulling back from the fleet.

01:19:04.531 --> 01:19:05.896
Looks like they've picked up
a little steam

01:19:05.908 --> 01:19:07.523
and patched up some damage.

01:19:07.534 --> 01:19:09.240
They might even take
a pot shot at us.

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:12.612
Copy. They probably ran
their bunkers down to fumes.

01:19:12.623 --> 01:19:14.705
I'll keep my distance.

01:19:14.708 --> 01:19:16.369
Probably a good idea.

01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:21.829
All hands, eyes on port side.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.580
What do you see, Nus?

01:19:24.718 --> 01:19:27.505
Ah, shit. Another one!

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:28.798
Starboard side.

01:19:28.806 --> 01:19:30.637
Oh, hell.

01:19:30.641 --> 01:19:32.381
We've wandered into range
of Wake's air strip!

01:19:32.393 --> 01:19:34.475
Dinner's over, boys!

01:19:34.478 --> 01:19:36.389
At least we got some
altitude this time.

01:19:36.397 --> 01:19:38.103
Does give us
a couple more options.

01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:39.643
I don't know what those options
are right now,

01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:41.311
but we'll think of something.

01:19:41.318 --> 01:19:43.809
A little weather right now
would be fantastic.

01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:45.357
Good idea.

01:19:45.364 --> 01:19:46.604
Let's find a squall.

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:48.731
Hang on, boys!

01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:55.113
Keep him off our backs, Smokey!

01:19:55.124 --> 01:19:56.739
I'm on it, skip.

01:19:59.712 --> 01:20:03.546
Left, left, left,
coming through, coming through!

01:20:03.549 --> 01:20:05.505
Here he comes. Climb low.

01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:07.795
Watch it, though.
He '5 still behind us.

01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:08.883
And where the hell are they?

01:20:08.887 --> 01:20:10.093
I can't spot them!

01:20:10.097 --> 01:20:11.962
Oh, going low, going low!

01:20:18.772 --> 01:20:20.854
I'm going up high,
going up high!

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:27.315
Now where the hell are they?

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:28.813
A brace of them
on the west side!

01:20:30.242 --> 01:20:32.528
- Where the hell are they?
- I can't spot them!

01:20:32.536 --> 01:20:34.117
You got get eyes on them?

01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:37.738
I think we lost them.

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:39.365
You're a damn jinx, Mansfield.

01:20:39.376 --> 01:20:41.241
Shut your damn pie hole
and get back here!

01:20:41.253 --> 01:20:42.959
Copy. Oh, here he comes again.

01:20:42.963 --> 01:20:45.295
Six o'clock level.
Torch it, Smokey!

01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:48.749
Get that son of a bitch!

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:53.136
Yeah, we took a piece off him!

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:54.801
Hopefully that'll slow him down.

01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:55.808
Down.

01:20:57.269 --> 01:20:58.269
Down.

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:01.016
Drop in the water
and play hole in the sea?

01:21:01.023 --> 01:21:03.014
Getting awfully dark outside.

01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:05.107
I'd rather hide than hope
he gets bored and goes home.

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:06.691
Agreed.

01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:09.022
We've completed our turn
and are en route back to Pearl.

01:23:11.904 --> 01:23:14.361
The galleys are serving
something special tonight

01:23:14.364 --> 01:23:16.525
for the aviators
and the flight deck apes.

01:23:16.533 --> 01:23:19.400
I'm sure they can save you some.

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:21.823
I've got a fondness
for Yankee pot roast.

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:27.457
Admiral Fletcher
will be taking command

01:23:27.461 --> 01:23:29.918
of the Saratoga tomorrow
when she arrives

01:23:29.922 --> 01:23:31.708
with replacement aircraft.

01:23:31.715 --> 01:23:34.331
- Yes, I know.
- I saw the dispatch.

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:37.087
It's a tragedy

01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:40.713
to lose a tough girl
like Yorktown.

01:23:40.724 --> 01:23:42.931
I wish we would have had
the planes to help defend her.

01:23:45.395 --> 01:23:48.853
We lost a lot of planes
sinking those carriers.

01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:50.722
But we could've lost a lot more.

01:23:51.902 --> 01:23:53.733
You were true to the men,

01:23:53.737 --> 01:23:56.774
and they won't forget that
anytime soon.

01:23:58.075 --> 01:24:00.282
I hope Fletcher
doesn't use them all up,

01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:02.116
listening to overeager men
like Browning.

01:24:03.956 --> 01:24:05.662
I certainly will drink
to that, Admiral.

01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:10.250
Well, why don't you
get started on the toasts?

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:12.336
And I'll begin the reports.

01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:15.588
See you, George.

01:24:41.994 --> 01:24:42.994
Lee.

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:46.528
I'm thirsty, Lee.

01:25:03.974 --> 01:25:07.262
This albatross around my neck.

01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:15.439
Water.

01:25:17.696 --> 01:25:19.186
I have no water.

01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:38.000
But I won't die.

01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:41.466
I won't die.

01:25:54.858 --> 01:25:56.814
But I'm not your puppet.

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:01.486
You hear me, God?

01:26:04.576 --> 01:26:06.407
I'm not your Job.

01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:12.031
And I can't suffer anymore.

01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:17.662
I'm not gonna suffer.

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:23.526
Hey.

01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:25.896
Hey, welcome aboard, Doc.

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:27.272
Yeah, welcome aboard.

01:27:27.284 --> 01:27:28.820
All we have is Mansfield there.

01:27:28.827 --> 01:27:30.158
He's only got two techniques
for medicine...

01:27:30.162 --> 01:27:32.403
Aspirin and stitches.

01:27:32.414 --> 01:27:34.370
I'll try and teach him
something.

01:27:34.374 --> 01:27:36.740
- Good luck.
- All right, boys. Listen up.

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:38.333
There's at least a hundred men
out there

01:27:38.336 --> 01:27:39.576
from the Enterprise alone,

01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:40.919
waiting to get picked up.

01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:43.334
We've got supplies, so let's go.

01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:45.206
We never did go look
for that poor SOB

01:27:45.218 --> 01:27:46.628
we dropped a boat to.

01:27:46.636 --> 01:27:48.217
- Oh, yeah.
- No, they picked him up.

01:27:48.221 --> 01:27:50.303
Hand to God, a destroyer
picked him up yesterday.

01:27:50.307 --> 01:27:51.672
Nearly ran him over.

01:27:51.683 --> 01:27:54.095
Marine aviator. Go figure.

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:55.467
Well, we're gonna keep
on looking.

01:27:55.479 --> 01:27:56.935
I'm all for looking, but, uh,

01:27:56.938 --> 01:27:59.020
how long can someone
on the water last?

01:27:59.024 --> 01:28:01.060
Doesn't matter. We've been
nearly shot down twice

01:28:01.067 --> 01:28:02.523
since the Japs came to town,

01:28:02.527 --> 01:28:03.892
and I sure as shit would want

01:28:03.904 --> 01:28:05.360
somebody out there
looking for us.

01:28:05.363 --> 01:28:07.649
We've got orders
to search and rescue,

01:28:07.657 --> 01:28:10.740
so we're searching
and we're rescuing.

01:28:10.744 --> 01:28:12.735
And when we run out of fuel,
we'll come back here,

01:28:12.746 --> 01:28:16.113
we'll get some more,
and we'll do it again.

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:18.740
Our brother's been out there
long enough.

01:28:18.752 --> 01:28:20.242
It's time to bring him home.

01:28:34.851 --> 01:28:38.430
- I don't know, uh...
- I don't know.

01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:43.394
Norman Francis Vandivier.

01:28:43.401 --> 01:28:44.982
Didn't you promise
never to walk through that door?

01:28:44.986 --> 01:28:46.476
We had plans to do our time

01:28:46.488 --> 01:28:50.151
and then fly beautiful,
rich women around the globe.

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:53.446
10,000 a year to start.

01:28:53.453 --> 01:28:55.159
It's three times more
than what we get paid

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:56.573
flying for Uncle Sam.

01:28:56.581 --> 01:28:58.037
I still got four years in,
though.

01:28:59.751 --> 01:29:02.458
In those four years,
we will log enough hours

01:29:02.462 --> 01:29:04.293
to get a job like that.

01:29:04.297 --> 01:29:05.787
They're gonna want to hire us?

01:29:05.799 --> 01:29:07.414
Pan Am is huge.

01:29:07.425 --> 01:29:10.588
They're opening up routes
to China and Australia,

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:12.631
all right?
They're hiring tons of pilots.

01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:14.049
They're dying for us.

01:29:16.476 --> 01:29:18.762
- I don't know.
- Uh, four years is a long time.

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:21.386
- Mm-hmm.
- I was kind of thinking about

01:29:21.398 --> 01:29:24.140
settling down here in Hawaii
when I get out.

01:29:24.150 --> 01:29:25.936
Are you still seeing
that, uh, that hot number?

01:29:25.944 --> 01:29:27.400
What's her name, um, Ellie?

01:29:29.656 --> 01:29:32.147
So it's getting serious?

01:29:32.158 --> 01:29:34.649
I think she's a good fit.

01:29:34.661 --> 01:29:36.572
It's perfect.

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:38.320
Free vacations for her.

01:29:38.331 --> 01:29:40.572
- Less competition for me.
- It's a win-win.

01:29:42.586 --> 01:29:44.497
I'll give you a maybe.

01:29:44.504 --> 01:29:46.210
Like I said before,
that's perfect.

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:49.126
A maybe is three Mai Tais
away from a yes.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.636
It's a parable of sorts.

01:30:10.864 --> 01:30:12.274
Hey, Lee.

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:17.074
Poor bastard.

01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:20.036
Suffers and suffers.

01:30:22.334 --> 01:30:24.666
And in the end, because...

01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:28.620
of his suffering, he is redeemed

01:30:28.632 --> 01:30:30.873
and restored by God's mercy.

01:30:35.972 --> 01:30:39.339
You know, you only mentioned
one poor bastard.

01:30:39.351 --> 01:30:40.351
Not two.

01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:45.771
I only... I only meant about us.

01:30:45.774 --> 01:30:47.230
I know what you meant.

01:30:49.903 --> 01:30:51.484
I'm sorry, Lee.

01:30:54.616 --> 01:30:55.981
It's okay.

01:30:58.495 --> 01:31:00.451
See you on the other side,
Norman.

01:31:02.666 --> 01:31:04.452
See you on the other side, Lee.

01:31:24.354 --> 01:31:25.594
Jim.

01:31:29.734 --> 01:31:31.440
Jim, I'm here.

01:31:36.408 --> 01:31:37.614
I'm here.

01:31:39.119 --> 01:31:40.119
Hey.

01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:46.709
Hey.

01:31:47.836 --> 01:31:49.246
All right. Setting her down.

01:31:49.254 --> 01:31:52.337
Easy. Easy.

01:32:05.437 --> 01:32:06.437
Huh?

01:32:14.112 --> 01:32:16.524
Hey, Doc, you're on.

01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:19.238
Smokey,
you feel like taking a swim?

01:32:19.242 --> 01:32:21.233
Machine gun champion
and Olympic class swimmer,

01:32:21.244 --> 01:32:22.984
you know me.

01:32:22.996 --> 01:32:24.952
I got control.

01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:26.116
Hey Skip.

01:32:26.124 --> 01:32:27.534
Go get him.

01:32:31.296 --> 01:32:33.378
Let's go, boys!

01:32:42.265 --> 01:32:43.596
You got him.

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.306
- Come on, Louie.
- Be careful, man.

01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:46.310
You got him.

01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:51.601
Norman Francis Vandivier,

01:32:51.608 --> 01:32:53.223
I thought I left you
back at Pearl,

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:55.020
black-out drunk under a table.

01:32:55.028 --> 01:32:57.770
You still owe me,
like, 10 drinks!

01:32:57.781 --> 01:33:01.490
I have an IOU
that says otherwise.

01:33:01.493 --> 01:33:03.984
Less talking, more swimming.

01:33:13.421 --> 01:33:15.002
Come on, come on, let's go.

01:33:15.006 --> 01:33:16.726
- We got you. We got you.
- Come on, Smokey.

01:33:42.367 --> 01:33:44.858
- Hey, you're in shock.
- You're in good hands now.

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:50.993
Thank you. Thank you.

01:33:57.549 --> 01:34:00.586
Yeah. Welcome aboard.

01:34:00.593 --> 01:34:03.050
We're gonna take you home.
