WEBVTT

00:05.494 --> 00:07.461
Yeah, I can hear her crying.

00:07.529 --> 00:10.565
Try that little rock-twist thing I do.

00:10.632 --> 00:13.267
That usually soothes her.

00:13.335 --> 00:15.403
It worked?

00:15.470 --> 00:17.238
Look at that.

00:17.306 --> 00:19.273
Uh, sweetheart,

00:19.341 --> 00:20.474
I have to go.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.910
Yeah. Give here a
kiss for me, would you?

00:22.978 --> 00:26.180
Okay, bye.

00:31.153 --> 00:33.921
Hey there. Where you headed?

00:33.989 --> 00:39.627
What you doing out here all by yourself?

00:39.695 --> 00:42.263
What about your parents? Do
they know you're out here?

00:44.700 --> 00:46.067
No, sir.

00:46.134 --> 00:47.468
What's your name, son?

00:47.536 --> 00:50.204
Teddy.

00:52.741 --> 00:55.009
Why don't you hop in, Teddy?

01:05.453 --> 01:08.122
So you were running away?

01:08.190 --> 01:10.858
Yeah.

01:10.926 --> 01:14.095
Well, I took off a few
times when I was your age.

01:14.162 --> 01:16.430
But I bet there's
people out there worried,

01:16.498 --> 01:19.634
looking for you.

01:19.701 --> 01:23.604
And you know what? It
doesn't matter what happened.

01:23.672 --> 01:27.208
I'm sure as soon as they see you...

01:32.648 --> 01:34.649
oh, my God!

01:34.716 --> 01:37.685
Oh, God, if I wasn't
looking at him myself,

01:37.753 --> 01:38.819
I wouldn't believe we caught one.

01:38.887 --> 01:40.855
I always thought they were nut jobs.

01:40.923 --> 01:43.557
The people who told those stories.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.793
Seeing is believing.

01:45.861 --> 01:47.328
Where'd he pick him up?

01:47.396 --> 01:48.896
Just off of 940.

01:48.964 --> 01:52.300
A quarter mile down the road from Edina.

01:52.367 --> 01:54.435
Teddy, I'm gonna take your picture.

01:54.503 --> 01:57.939
Can you put your juice
down and sit up for me?

02:10.118 --> 02:12.219
I think we should call
the papers, Johnny.

02:12.287 --> 02:13.754
He's just a kid.

02:13.822 --> 02:14.989
He's one of them.

02:15.057 --> 02:16.290
I don't care how old he is,

02:16.358 --> 02:18.225
people have a right to know.

02:18.293 --> 02:19.560
We're not calling anyone
until this thing goes

02:19.628 --> 02:22.029
through proper channels.

02:22.097 --> 02:23.965
How much you want to bet
somebody in the proper channels

02:24.032 --> 02:26.400
leaks it to...

02:35.811 --> 02:38.312
I'm sorry.

02:43.919 --> 02:53.919
Sync by honeybunny www.addic7ed.com

03:07.142 --> 03:08.909
Walter, come on. Let's go.

03:08.977 --> 03:12.413
Why do I have to go in there?

03:12.481 --> 03:15.116
Because we're out of milk.

03:15.183 --> 03:17.118
And because you haven't left
the house in over a week,

03:17.185 --> 03:18.419
and you can't just stay inside

03:18.487 --> 03:21.122
watching old movies all the time.

03:21.189 --> 03:22.590
Look at all those people, Peter.

03:22.657 --> 03:25.259
What if I get lost again?

03:25.327 --> 03:27.595
What if he's in there?

03:27.662 --> 03:30.131
Walter...

03:30.198 --> 03:32.333
He's not in there.

03:32.401 --> 03:33.801
And I promise you

03:33.869 --> 03:35.870
I will never let you
get kidnapped again.

03:35.937 --> 03:37.972
Okay?

03:40.842 --> 03:42.877
No. No.

03:42.944 --> 03:45.513
I'm learning to appreciate cowardice.

03:45.580 --> 03:47.815
The lion had a point.

03:47.883 --> 03:50.051
- The lion?
- The cowardly lion.

03:50.118 --> 03:52.520
But again, that was just a movie.

03:52.587 --> 03:54.955
And there's no flying monkeys
inside the grocery store.

03:57.726 --> 03:59.994
Hey.

04:00.062 --> 04:02.296
Hey, can you be ready
to go in half an hour?

04:02.364 --> 04:03.297
Why? What's up?

04:03.365 --> 04:05.533
Three dead cops and a missing kid.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.368
Doesn't really sound
like our kind of case.

04:07.436 --> 04:09.670
Yeah, well, wait till
you hear about the kid.

04:14.843 --> 04:17.144
John pekarsky was the senior trooper

04:17.212 --> 04:18.745
on duty last night.

04:18.814 --> 04:21.882
He uploaded his report to
the state police database

04:21.950 --> 04:24.018
sometime after 9:00.

04:24.086 --> 04:25.352
According to the coroner,

04:25.420 --> 04:27.054
pekarsky and the other
two troopers on duty

04:27.122 --> 04:28.322
were dead within the hour.

04:28.390 --> 04:31.192
And the kid? He was gone.

04:31.259 --> 04:33.194
I think whoever did
this was coming for him.

04:33.261 --> 04:34.595
They didn't leave any kind of trail.

04:34.663 --> 04:37.698
We haven't found a single
print or shell casing.

04:37.766 --> 04:39.400
And they took the
surveillance hard drive.

04:39.468 --> 04:41.102
But there was a picture of the kid?

04:41.169 --> 04:45.706
Pekarsky uploaded it
along with his report.

04:48.276 --> 04:50.211
I saw a boy who looked like this once.

04:50.278 --> 04:54.682
He was young, like this child,

04:54.749 --> 04:57.852
and he played the banjo, I think.

04:57.919 --> 05:01.021
It was a haunting melody.

05:04.526 --> 05:07.761
Yes.

05:07.829 --> 05:09.797
You saw it too.

05:09.865 --> 05:11.732
Yes, I did. It's a movie, Walter.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.969
It's called deliverance.
We saw it together.

05:17.639 --> 05:19.039
Probably not the same boy.

05:19.107 --> 05:20.941
According to his report,

05:21.009 --> 05:23.077
this kid looked completely normal

05:23.145 --> 05:24.612
when pekarsky picked him up.

05:24.679 --> 05:26.447
Agent Broyles, we found something

05:26.515 --> 05:27.882
you might want to take a look at.

05:27.949 --> 05:30.651
We found it in their files.

05:30.719 --> 05:33.087
There are 30 or 40 reports in there.

05:33.155 --> 05:36.891
Strange stories about
these deformed people.

05:36.958 --> 05:38.759
Well, some of these are 30 years old.

05:38.827 --> 05:41.262
"I saw him change in front of me.

05:41.329 --> 05:42.830
Suddenly he was hideous."

05:42.898 --> 05:44.665
Like trooper pekarsky reported.

05:44.733 --> 05:47.034
"Misshapen and deformed.

05:47.102 --> 05:49.069
It looked like a cousin of bigfoot."

05:49.137 --> 05:51.372
That's clearly wrong.

05:51.439 --> 05:54.742
This boy bears no resemblance
at all to a sasquatch.

05:54.809 --> 05:56.443
Or a yeti, for that matter.

05:56.511 --> 05:58.212
Well, you don't...

05:58.280 --> 06:00.147
you don't believe in those creatures?

06:00.215 --> 06:01.782
Why shouldn't I?

06:01.850 --> 06:03.751
Just because no one has documented

06:03.818 --> 06:06.453
flying monkeys or talking lions yet

06:06.521 --> 06:08.355
hardly means they don't exist.

06:08.423 --> 06:10.024
Agent frug,

06:10.091 --> 06:11.992
my father's a bit of a shock-doc.

06:12.060 --> 06:12.993
Don't let him alarm you.

06:13.061 --> 06:14.995
All of these reports were dismissed.

06:15.063 --> 06:18.199
Thee was no cooperation
and no hard evidence.

06:18.266 --> 06:20.201
But the vast majority of them occurred

06:20.268 --> 06:21.335
in the same area.

06:21.403 --> 06:23.003
Just outside Edina.

06:23.071 --> 06:24.438
That's where the boy was picked up,

06:24.506 --> 06:25.639
walking out of Edina.

06:25.707 --> 06:27.641
I guess that's where we start looking.

06:31.446 --> 06:33.447
Dunham...

06:33.515 --> 06:35.816
Whatever these things are,

06:35.884 --> 06:40.087
it seems like they've managed
to hide themselves for a while.

06:40.155 --> 06:41.855
And from the looks of things,

06:41.923 --> 06:44.792
they'll do just about
anything to keep it that way.

06:44.859 --> 06:50.030
Keep it in mind.

06:54.736 --> 06:56.670
Yes, sir.

07:17.694 --> 07:19.228
I don't think this is a good idea.

07:19.296 --> 07:22.331
It's okay, we're just gonna
ask a couple of questions.

07:27.070 --> 07:30.172
There may be werewolves in these hills.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.674
- Werewolves?
- Mm.

07:31.741 --> 07:34.310
That trooper reported
that the boy changed

07:34.377 --> 07:35.511
in front of his eyes.

07:35.578 --> 07:37.579
So yes, I believe we may be looking

07:37.647 --> 07:40.516
for some kind of therianthrope.

07:40.583 --> 07:41.884
It's greek.

07:41.951 --> 07:44.186
Refers to a creature that
has a metamorphic ability

07:44.254 --> 07:46.255
to shift between being a man an a beast.

07:46.323 --> 07:47.623
It's mythological, of course.

07:47.691 --> 07:50.693
I saw one once when I was a young man

07:50.760 --> 07:51.794
studying in London.

07:51.861 --> 07:52.795
I was under the influence

07:52.862 --> 07:54.563
of a fairly potent blend of hashish...

07:54.631 --> 07:56.432
guys, hang on a second.

07:56.499 --> 07:59.234
Do you hear that?

07:59.302 --> 08:00.936
That buzz?

08:07.644 --> 08:10.579
* hard artichokes rarely keep *

08:10.647 --> 08:12.781
* norwegian elephants *

08:12.849 --> 08:14.350
* Singapore sleep *

08:14.417 --> 08:16.952
Hey, what... what are you singing?

08:17.020 --> 08:19.455
I have no idea.

08:19.522 --> 08:21.123
It just popped into my head.

08:21.191 --> 08:22.725
It must be that... that buzzing.

08:22.792 --> 08:25.127
I... I can't stop it.

08:25.195 --> 08:27.196
Agent Dunham?

08:27.263 --> 08:29.965
Sheriff Velchik. Hi.

08:30.033 --> 08:31.967
Thank you for meeting
us on such short notice.

08:32.034 --> 08:33.034
Oh, of course.

08:33.102 --> 08:34.470
I couldn't help but notice

08:34.537 --> 08:36.205
that you've gotten
acquainted with the Edina hum.

08:36.272 --> 08:37.373
Yeah, what is that?

08:37.440 --> 08:40.008
Military base, about
five miles down the road.

08:40.076 --> 08:41.744
They have a bunch of
big turbine generators

08:41.811 --> 08:43.312
that get pretty loud from time to time.

08:43.380 --> 08:45.147
Well, that's one mystery solved.

08:45.215 --> 08:46.181
Why don't we have some coffee.

08:46.249 --> 08:49.718
Maybe I can help you with the other.

08:49.786 --> 08:52.855
So I take it you've heard
about what happened last night

08:52.922 --> 08:55.090
to the three troopers in Jonestown.

08:55.158 --> 08:57.359
I understand that the
perpetrators took a kid.

08:57.427 --> 09:00.529
Yeah.

09:06.035 --> 09:07.770
My God.

09:07.837 --> 09:09.405
You've never seen
anything like that before?

09:09.472 --> 09:11.540
No.

09:11.608 --> 09:15.878
I've never seen a
photograph of... one of them.

09:15.945 --> 09:18.046
Then you have heard the stories?

09:18.114 --> 09:19.948
Of course. Telling those stories is

09:20.016 --> 09:21.250
a bit of a local pastime.

09:21.317 --> 09:23.218
You hear 'em all over
this part of the state.

09:23.286 --> 09:24.720
Well, sheriff, this boy was picked up

09:24.788 --> 09:26.755
just outside of your town.

09:26.823 --> 09:29.358
And the state police have 30 or 40

09:29.426 --> 09:31.693
unconfirmed eyewitness reports.

09:31.761 --> 09:35.297
Oh, yeah, we get our
fair share of sightings,

09:35.365 --> 09:38.300
but I've never been
able to confirm them.

09:38.368 --> 09:40.402
Nothing like this.

09:40.470 --> 09:42.905
Well, we'd like to see those reports.

09:42.972 --> 09:45.774
Of course. Anything I can do.

09:53.616 --> 09:54.650
What is it?

09:54.717 --> 09:57.886
It's nothing.

09:57.954 --> 09:59.455
Joseph?

09:59.522 --> 10:04.660
Federal Agents came into the diner.

10:04.727 --> 10:06.562
They had a photograph of Teddy.

10:06.629 --> 10:09.565
And they're asking
questions about the killings.

10:09.632 --> 10:11.834
I told you that wasn't the answer!

10:11.901 --> 10:13.402
What choice did we have?

10:13.470 --> 10:15.370
Well, what are we gonna do?

10:17.707 --> 10:19.875
I don't know yet.

10:31.721 --> 10:34.056
We didn't get anything
from the autopsies.

10:34.123 --> 10:35.157
Looks like the troopers were killed

10:35.225 --> 10:36.825
with 12-gauge shotgun blasts.

10:36.893 --> 10:38.360
But there's probably a shotgun

10:38.428 --> 10:40.295
in every house in
this part of the state.

10:40.363 --> 10:41.964
You make a good point.

10:42.031 --> 10:43.599
You went through all
the sheriff's reports?

10:43.666 --> 10:44.633
Yeah, they've had similar sightings,

10:44.701 --> 10:46.468
but nothing conclusive.

10:46.536 --> 10:47.703
Though sheriff velchik did mention

10:47.770 --> 10:49.605
a military base down the road.

10:49.672 --> 10:51.373
You floating another government
conspiracy theory, mr bishop?

10:51.441 --> 10:53.775
You know me, I never miss a chance

10:53.843 --> 10:54.943
for a good conspiracy theory.

10:55.011 --> 10:57.546
Okay, I'll look into it.

11:00.250 --> 11:02.885
God, how far away is
the hotel? I'm exhausted.

11:02.952 --> 11:04.119
I don't know.

11:04.187 --> 11:05.854
It's only supposed to
be a couple more miles.

11:05.922 --> 11:08.023
Though somebody's already
decided to call it a night.

11:08.091 --> 11:09.458
Well, he's had a big day.

11:09.526 --> 11:11.393
You got him out of the
house he's working a case.

11:16.666 --> 11:18.600
I understand why he's scared.

11:18.668 --> 11:21.937
But it just doesn't seem like he's able

11:22.005 --> 11:23.171
to snap out of it this time.

11:23.239 --> 11:25.874
It reminds me of how he was

11:25.942 --> 11:27.809
when we first got him
out of St. Claire's.

11:27.877 --> 11:29.478
I'm worried that he's
starting to go backwards.

11:29.546 --> 11:32.114
I think he's starting to appear

11:32.181 --> 11:35.350
no less normal than the rest of us.

11:35.418 --> 11:39.821
I ran into a guy from
high school this morning.

11:39.889 --> 11:40.889
You should have seen
the look in his eyes

11:40.957 --> 11:43.458
when I told him what I did.

11:43.526 --> 11:44.726
Like chicks with guns turned him on?

11:44.794 --> 11:47.563
More like I was a freak.

11:47.630 --> 11:50.699
Like I had suddenly grown a third eye.

11:52.769 --> 11:56.204
You ever get the feeling
that doing this job

11:56.272 --> 11:57.739
just makes you less and less normal?

11:57.807 --> 11:59.508
Absolutely.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.113
Olivia!

12:24.901 --> 12:26.935
Olivia.

12:28.705 --> 12:29.671
Olivia!

13:16.919 --> 13:17.853
Are we there yet, Peter?

13:17.920 --> 13:19.321
Walter, get down!

13:36.920 --> 13:38.687
You know, it's generally
pretty quiet in this area.

13:39.055 --> 13:40.722
Not much in the way of dead cops

13:40.790 --> 13:42.190
and feds being run off the road.

13:42.258 --> 13:43.692
But you think you shot it?

13:43.759 --> 13:45.760
Maybe. I don't know.

13:45.828 --> 13:47.028
But it was able to drive off.

13:48.264 --> 13:49.798
Yeah?

13:49.866 --> 13:52.434
We'll be right there.

13:52.502 --> 13:54.769
One of our Agents just found
an abandoned pickup truck

13:54.837 --> 13:56.538
on the side of the road
about a mile from here.

13:56.606 --> 13:57.672
Back towards Edina.

14:05.848 --> 14:07.182
Is that the vehicle?

14:07.250 --> 14:08.216
I don't know.

14:08.284 --> 14:09.451
It was heading straight for us.

14:09.519 --> 14:10.619
Could be.

14:10.686 --> 14:14.356
Do we have a preliminary?

14:14.423 --> 14:16.324
No plates, no registration.

14:16.392 --> 14:17.492
We have a forensic team on the way.

14:17.560 --> 14:18.793
We should have them run

14:18.861 --> 14:20.228
the truck's vin number,

14:20.296 --> 14:21.997
see if you can track down an owner.

14:28.204 --> 14:29.504
Peter. Peter.

14:29.572 --> 14:33.542
What? What is it?

14:35.878 --> 14:37.379
The large blue.

14:37.446 --> 14:40.182
Isn't she magnificent!

14:40.249 --> 14:43.051
I've never seen one this
big on this continent.

14:43.119 --> 14:44.853
Look, Olivia.

14:44.921 --> 14:49.191
I know a certain lepidopterist
who will be simply thrilled.

14:49.258 --> 14:52.494
I have to get my Kit from the car.

14:57.166 --> 14:59.634
Peter, look.

15:04.774 --> 15:05.907
It's blood.

15:09.745 --> 15:13.215
Agent Frug, over here. We got something.

15:19.188 --> 15:20.222
Careful, Peter.

15:26.262 --> 15:28.330
You said you shot at
the creature, right?

15:28.397 --> 15:29.531
Yeah.

15:29.599 --> 15:31.967
Yeah.

15:32.034 --> 15:33.768
You sure you saw what you think you saw?

15:33.836 --> 15:35.737
Agent frug,

15:35.805 --> 15:37.105
what happened here is simple.

15:37.173 --> 15:40.875
My son shot a beast. We found a man.

15:40.943 --> 15:44.479
Obviously the creature
transformed in the interim.

15:44.547 --> 15:48.416
Peter, do you realize
the significance of this?

15:48.484 --> 15:52.821
We may have found a creature
with metamorphic ability.

15:54.857 --> 15:57.959
* hard artichokes rarely keep *

15:58.027 --> 15:59.961
* norwegian elephants *

16:00.029 --> 16:01.596
* Singapore sleep *

16:08.371 --> 16:13.808
There was no I.D. on the guy
so we're gonna run some prints.

16:13.876 --> 16:18.146
You had no choice.

16:21.851 --> 16:25.387
First time I killed someone,
the guy was a trained killer.

16:25.454 --> 16:30.025
If I hadn't pulled the
trigger, I'd be dead.

16:30.092 --> 16:32.994
I still didn't sleep that night.

16:33.062 --> 16:37.332
Or the next.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.769
I'm just saying the first time's rough.

17:04.794 --> 17:06.594
Take the ramp down to the left.

17:12.501 --> 17:14.169
You're good. Just follow the mooing.

17:16.038 --> 17:17.605
Dunham.

17:17.673 --> 17:19.973
Everyone okay there?

17:20.041 --> 17:21.476
More or less. Thanks.

17:21.544 --> 17:24.378
I got a call from our military liaison.

17:24.446 --> 17:25.613
There's something to the rumors

17:25.681 --> 17:27.048
of military testing at Edina.

17:27.116 --> 17:29.718
Turns out the army was
there in the late '70s

17:29.785 --> 17:31.419
conducting a series of
classified experiments.

17:31.487 --> 17:33.021
Anything to do with metamorphic ability?

17:33.089 --> 17:35.056
Not that I can tell.

17:35.124 --> 17:37.325
The Pentagon files have been
almost entirely redacted.

17:37.393 --> 17:39.561
I put a call into the DOD,

17:39.628 --> 17:41.529
but in the meantime
I'm faxing what we have.

17:41.597 --> 17:45.033
Right down here. Just put it right here.

17:45.101 --> 17:47.369
Perfect. Thanks, fellas.

17:52.575 --> 17:56.211
Agent Farnsworth, help me with my Kit.

17:56.278 --> 17:57.712
I have to get to work,

17:57.780 --> 17:59.547
but there's a wonderful
specimen in there

17:59.615 --> 18:02.751
for my favorite fan
of four-winged fauna.

18:02.818 --> 18:04.419
I think you'll be quite tickled.

18:04.487 --> 18:07.322
Peter, look at this.

18:07.390 --> 18:11.059
The military experiment
they did in Edina

18:11.127 --> 18:13.027
was called "Project Elephant."

18:13.095 --> 18:15.897
Walter's song.

18:15.965 --> 18:17.699
Walter...

18:17.767 --> 18:20.034
Were you involved in
any military testing

18:20.102 --> 18:21.169
in Edina?

18:21.237 --> 18:22.971
Not that I recall.

18:23.038 --> 18:25.240
I'm sure I'd remember
something as exciting

18:25.307 --> 18:28.209
as human metamorphosis.

18:33.582 --> 18:35.583
Another one that won't unzip.

18:37.386 --> 18:39.220
Ugh.

18:39.288 --> 18:42.123
Walter, it's very sweet of you

18:42.191 --> 18:43.458
to remember how much I love butterflies,

18:43.526 --> 18:45.860
but you forgot how much I hate moths.

18:45.928 --> 18:47.695
What have you done to it?

18:47.763 --> 18:50.365
Excuse me?

18:50.433 --> 18:53.735
You saw it, Peter.

18:53.803 --> 18:57.071
It... it was an astounding creature!

18:57.139 --> 19:00.108
Nothing like this.
It's wing is deformed.

19:00.176 --> 19:03.077
Walter, if that's your idea of a joke,

19:03.145 --> 19:05.713
it's really not very funny.

19:05.781 --> 19:07.148
Aah!

19:11.654 --> 19:13.421
Oh, my.

19:20.421 --> 19:23.322
You'll want to add some
wild thyme to the jar, dear.

19:23.390 --> 19:27.026
It's possible we could get
the moth to transform back.

19:27.094 --> 19:30.496
It really was the most
beautiful butterfly.

19:30.564 --> 19:32.365
I'll believe that when I see it.

19:32.433 --> 19:34.133
Walter, I understand what you're saying

19:34.201 --> 19:36.836
about the moth and the man
transforming in the same way,

19:36.904 --> 19:38.971
but I just don't understand
how that could be possible.

19:39.039 --> 19:42.809
It's likely that both
developed the ability

19:42.876 --> 19:45.244
in response to the same
experimental stimulus.

19:45.312 --> 19:47.447
Slide.

19:47.514 --> 19:48.648
You mean the military testing.

19:48.716 --> 19:52.919
Exactly.

19:52.986 --> 19:56.589
Well, why would the military
be testing a butterfly?

19:56.657 --> 20:00.560
A butterfly has two stages of life.

20:00.627 --> 20:03.763
It's one of the few creatures
with a demonstrated ability

20:03.831 --> 20:06.332
to abruptly change its body structure.

20:06.400 --> 20:10.536
That makes it a wonderful
Alpha test subject.

20:16.143 --> 20:17.610
That's odd.

20:17.678 --> 20:18.978
What?

20:20.948 --> 20:23.516
There's no sign of
histolysis or histogenesis.

20:23.584 --> 20:26.319
Nothing to suggest a
metamorphic ability.

20:28.388 --> 20:30.323
I just don't understand
how he can possibly

20:30.390 --> 20:32.258
have transformed himself.

20:32.326 --> 20:34.594
So we didn't get a match
on the fingerprints,

20:34.661 --> 20:36.295
but we did get a hit

20:36.363 --> 20:37.296
with the truck's vin number.

20:37.364 --> 20:38.664
It was registered to Joe Falls.

20:38.732 --> 20:40.399
But the address on the
registration was old.

20:40.467 --> 20:41.601
The house had been torn down years ago.

20:41.668 --> 20:43.002
But he was from Edina?

20:43.070 --> 20:45.271
Yeah.

20:49.676 --> 20:52.912
Joe Falls?

20:52.980 --> 20:54.013
He worked at the mill.

20:54.081 --> 20:56.282
Still does odd jobs now and then.

20:56.350 --> 20:58.684
You think that that thing that tried

20:58.752 --> 21:00.653
to run you off the road...
you think that could be him?

21:00.721 --> 21:03.356
It's possible.

21:03.423 --> 21:04.624
There was no photograph on his file,

21:04.691 --> 21:08.394
so we haven't been able
to make a positive I.D.

21:08.462 --> 21:11.330
Do you have any idea where
he's been living recently?

21:11.398 --> 21:13.666
The last I heard,

21:13.734 --> 21:15.768
he'd moved to the outskirts of town.

21:15.836 --> 21:17.170
But I couldn't say where.

21:17.237 --> 21:20.506
I mean, I'm happy to ask around for you.

21:20.574 --> 21:22.608
We'd also like to have a
look at the town records.

21:22.676 --> 21:25.678
See if we can find a last
known address or a photo

21:25.746 --> 21:27.647
so that we can I.D.

21:27.714 --> 21:29.715
Sure. I'll take you over to town hall.

21:29.783 --> 21:31.717
Did you finish the analysis

21:31.785 --> 21:32.885
on the blood sample from the moth?

21:32.953 --> 21:34.020
Yes, I did.

21:34.087 --> 21:37.223
It had some sort of genetic disorder.

21:37.291 --> 21:42.161
Ah, germline mutation.
Just as I thought.

21:42.229 --> 21:44.697
This man has the exact same disorder.

21:44.765 --> 21:48.134
Is that what you think
let's them...transform?

21:48.202 --> 21:50.970
No, the mutation is
what makes them deformed.

21:51.038 --> 21:53.840
I have no idea what
makes them transform.

21:56.243 --> 21:58.344
Walter?

21:58.412 --> 21:59.846
It's curious.

21:59.913 --> 22:03.749
I have this strange feeling

22:03.817 --> 22:05.585
that I've seen this mutation before.

22:09.923 --> 22:11.524
Please, not that song again.

22:11.592 --> 22:13.559
It's giving me a headache.

22:13.627 --> 22:15.595
Ah, yes...

22:15.662 --> 22:19.832
* hard artichokes rarely keep *

22:19.900 --> 22:22.235
* norwegian elephants *

22:22.302 --> 22:24.770
* Singapore sleep *

22:24.838 --> 22:27.874
the testing at Edina...
Project Elephant.

22:27.941 --> 22:30.943
I think that's where I've
seen this mutation before.

22:33.213 --> 22:35.281
Maybe I did work on Project Elephant,

22:35.349 --> 22:39.218
like Agent Dunham said.

22:39.286 --> 22:43.089
Hmm. So why did I put them into a song?

22:43.156 --> 22:45.591
Mmm.

22:45.659 --> 22:47.627
Wait a second.

22:47.694 --> 22:51.931
Walter, what are the words again?

22:51.999 --> 22:56.102
* hard artichokes rarely keep *

22:56.169 --> 22:57.837
* norwegian elephants *

22:57.905 --> 23:00.239
* Singapore sleep * * Singapore sleep. *

23:00.307 --> 23:04.010
Does "harkness" mean anything to you?

23:04.077 --> 23:08.915
Harkness is a library at the law school.

23:10.317 --> 23:12.852
The song is a mnemonic, yes?

23:12.920 --> 23:15.154
You must have done
it on purpose, Walter.

23:15.222 --> 23:16.389
Yes.

23:16.456 --> 23:19.792
So what's at the law school library?

23:22.996 --> 23:26.299
Come along, Astrid. Let's find out.

23:28.535 --> 23:30.036
There's nothing in the housing records

23:30.103 --> 23:31.804
on a Joe Falls.

23:31.872 --> 23:33.639
There's nothing in
the tax records either.

23:33.707 --> 23:35.708
In fact, the whole "f" section is gone.

23:35.776 --> 23:37.176
Anyone whose last name starts with "f."

23:37.244 --> 23:39.612
You can't just walk in and
check these records out.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.180
No, but you can steal them.

23:41.248 --> 23:43.182
Let's check the federal records

23:43.250 --> 23:46.519
if you lived here, you
must be on the census.

23:46.586 --> 23:48.721
This is it.

23:48.789 --> 23:50.189
I remember now.

23:52.326 --> 23:53.292
Walter...

23:53.360 --> 23:56.095
What happened to you in Edina?

23:56.163 --> 23:59.131
You're like a different
person since you got back.

23:59.199 --> 24:03.736
I've always found
work to be restorative.

24:05.906 --> 24:07.540
When Peter was sick,

24:07.607 --> 24:10.943
it was the only thing
that kept me going.

24:11.011 --> 24:15.548
Amazing how it heals the soul.

24:19.953 --> 24:20.953
Oh, look.

24:23.724 --> 24:26.192
Devil dogs. I loved these.

24:26.259 --> 24:30.229
Walter, we can get you a fresh one.

24:54.621 --> 24:56.756
Oh, my, oh...

24:56.823 --> 25:00.860
They're deformed.

25:00.927 --> 25:04.730
Just like that man in the lab.

25:07.801 --> 25:10.903
I understand now.

25:10.971 --> 25:13.839
There's nothing on Joe Falls in 1990.

25:13.907 --> 25:16.609
- Anything in
2000? - Uh-uh.

25:16.676 --> 25:19.678
Anything in there on the
current population of Edina?

25:19.746 --> 25:24.517
Uh, 1,943. It was on the sign.

25:24.584 --> 25:26.886
Why?

25:26.953 --> 25:28.587
I don't know, there's
just something strange

25:28.655 --> 25:31.791
about these census numbers.

25:31.858 --> 25:33.759
Between the years of 1990 and 2000,

25:33.827 --> 25:36.128
17 people died, 47 people were born.

25:36.196 --> 25:39.065
That's the only change
in the population.

25:42.302 --> 25:44.804
Sheriff.

25:44.871 --> 25:47.506
Uh, some of your tax files are missing.

25:47.574 --> 25:49.241
Uh, all of the section "f."

25:49.309 --> 25:51.077
Including Falls.

25:51.144 --> 25:53.479
I may know who's responsible.

25:53.547 --> 25:55.281
The local tax collector
said that Falls had moved

25:55.348 --> 25:56.882
out to the edge of town.

25:56.950 --> 26:00.319
He's living in a trailer
with his wife and his son.

26:00.387 --> 26:01.454
How old is the boy?

26:01.521 --> 26:05.257
He said he was seven or eight.

26:05.325 --> 26:06.792
I've got an address
if you want to meet me.

26:06.860 --> 26:09.562
Yeah. That'd be great.

26:09.629 --> 26:11.764
Thanks.

26:11.832 --> 26:13.165
We'll see you there.

26:31.351 --> 26:35.154
They don't know anything.

26:35.222 --> 26:36.722
There's nothing to worry about.

26:36.790 --> 26:38.491
It's going to be fine.

26:38.558 --> 26:39.558
You're wrong, Paul.

26:39.626 --> 26:41.627
They found out.

26:41.695 --> 26:45.898
Rose, I know you have a
special interest in this,

26:45.966 --> 26:47.633
but they don't know anything.

26:47.701 --> 26:51.537
They have a photograph. They have proof.

26:51.605 --> 26:52.605
Others have come before.

26:52.672 --> 26:55.741
I'm gonna take care of this.

26:55.809 --> 26:58.377
I'll make it all go away.

27:07.364 --> 27:09.599
So the man and the moth

27:09.666 --> 27:11.434
didn't transform at all.

27:11.502 --> 27:13.169
No, no.

27:13.237 --> 27:16.672
No, this is something else entirely.

27:16.740 --> 27:20.977
In the late '70s, the
army became obsessed

27:21.044 --> 27:23.679
with finding a new way
to camouflage soldiers.

27:23.747 --> 27:24.814
They started experimenting

27:24.882 --> 27:27.817
with electromagnetic pulses.

27:27.885 --> 27:29.685
- As their camouflage?
- Oh, yes.

27:29.753 --> 27:33.756
The eye converts electromagnetic energy

27:33.824 --> 27:35.224
into something the brain can understand.

27:35.292 --> 27:36.492
That's how vision works.

27:36.560 --> 27:39.362
Well, the army thought
that if they could generate

27:39.429 --> 27:42.231
a massive electromagnetic pulse,

27:42.299 --> 27:45.535
then they could effectively
scramble the optic nerve.

27:45.602 --> 27:48.037
And at the right frequency,
make the soldiers invisible

27:48.105 --> 27:50.039
to the naked eye.

27:50.107 --> 27:52.074
And you consulted on this project?

27:52.142 --> 27:53.976
Briefly.

27:54.044 --> 27:56.679
It was after I left that they realized

27:56.747 --> 27:58.881
that prolonged exposure to the pulse

27:58.949 --> 28:00.349
has a horrible side effect.

28:00.417 --> 28:03.252
An incurable genetic disorder.

28:03.320 --> 28:09.826
And this moth and that deformed man

28:09.893 --> 28:12.695
are the victims... or the
children of the victims

28:12.763 --> 28:13.796
of that experiment.

28:13.864 --> 28:16.265
So how does that explain their ability

28:16.333 --> 28:17.600
to change, Walter?

28:17.668 --> 28:19.202
Here, stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop here.

28:27.211 --> 28:28.344
Come. Come.

28:28.412 --> 28:30.446
- Leave the lights on.
- Walter.

28:30.514 --> 28:33.249
Walter, what are you doing?

28:45.529 --> 28:48.965
Ah...

28:49.032 --> 28:50.466
What do you see?

28:54.538 --> 28:56.539
I see the moth.

28:56.607 --> 28:59.942
Come here, please.

29:10.320 --> 29:11.654
Now what do you see?

29:18.829 --> 29:20.997
A friend of mine once wrote that

29:21.064 --> 29:25.334
sufficiently advanced technology

29:25.402 --> 29:27.803
is indistinguishable from magic.

29:27.871 --> 29:29.572
How is it doing that?

29:29.640 --> 29:31.908
It isn't.

29:31.975 --> 29:35.811
The man and the moth
don't change at all.

29:35.879 --> 29:40.049
What changes is our perception of them.

29:49.860 --> 29:52.628
Walter... Walter, slow down.

29:52.696 --> 29:54.764
You're saying that this
electromagnetic pulse

29:54.831 --> 29:56.499
allows us to see these deformed people

29:56.566 --> 29:58.000
as if they were normal?

29:58.068 --> 30:00.069
Yes. Somebody must have perfected

30:00.137 --> 30:02.605
the military's camouflage technology

30:02.673 --> 30:04.006
to hide the deformities

30:04.074 --> 30:06.075
that the first tests created.

30:06.143 --> 30:08.811
So then so long as we stay
within the range of the pulse...

30:08.879 --> 30:11.013
Then these poor souls

30:11.081 --> 30:13.115
appear totally normal.

30:13.183 --> 30:14.483
So that's the Edina hum.

30:14.551 --> 30:16.319
That's the sound that the pulse makes.

30:16.386 --> 30:18.321
Yes. Yes, I believe so.

30:18.388 --> 30:21.924
Walter, do you know who could
have perfected this technology?

30:21.992 --> 30:23.826
No, no.

30:23.894 --> 30:25.261
It would be extremely difficult.

30:25.329 --> 30:27.830
Apart from Cobb, no one else
would have the expertise.

30:27.898 --> 30:30.599
Cobb? Who's Cobb?

30:30.667 --> 30:34.103
Edward Cobb was the scientist
who dreamed up Project Elephant.

30:34.171 --> 30:36.005
He would be the only
one with the imagination

30:36.073 --> 30:37.239
and the know-how.

30:37.307 --> 30:39.141
Listen, Walter, I want you and Astrid

30:39.209 --> 30:40.276
to head back home.

30:40.344 --> 30:42.478
But... but given my knowledge...

30:42.546 --> 30:43.579
Walter, listen to me.

30:43.647 --> 30:45.581
Somebody obviously has a lot invested

30:45.649 --> 30:47.049
in keeping this thing a secret.

30:47.117 --> 30:48.551
- They've killed three people already...
- They tried to kill us.

30:48.618 --> 30:50.019
I don't want to have to worry about you.

30:50.087 --> 30:53.656
Oh, well, that's... that's
very sweet of you, son.

30:53.724 --> 30:57.660
I'll see you back at hom

30:57.728 --> 30:59.729
what did Peter say?

30:59.796 --> 31:02.531
He wants us to head into town

31:02.599 --> 31:06.669
to try and find the source
of the electromagnetic pulse.

31:14.711 --> 31:16.712
There's been too much bloodshed already.

31:16.780 --> 31:18.147
It's just making things worse.

31:18.215 --> 31:19.215
You got your boy back.

31:19.282 --> 31:21.717
Would you rather we'd let them keep him?

31:21.785 --> 31:23.386
You're killing innocent people.

31:23.453 --> 31:24.487
It's time to give this up.

31:24.554 --> 31:26.455
There are real consequences.

31:26.523 --> 31:27.656
Sure.

31:27.724 --> 31:29.725
There are real stakes here.

31:29.793 --> 31:31.160
That's why you gotta let me do my job

31:31.228 --> 31:32.428
and keep this town safe.

31:32.496 --> 31:34.764
And you think that killing
those federal officers

31:34.831 --> 31:35.998
is the best way to put a stop to this?

31:36.066 --> 31:37.299
It did the last time.

31:37.367 --> 31:39.235
That federal marshal a few years ago...

31:39.302 --> 31:42.705
no one came looking for him, did they?

31:42.773 --> 31:44.440
We've all got jobs to do, Rose.

31:44.508 --> 31:47.143
Stick to the machine. That's your job.

31:59.256 --> 32:00.322
Walter...

32:00.390 --> 32:02.858
What kind of device are we looking for?

32:02.926 --> 32:08.164
Any number of things
could transmit the pulse.

32:08.231 --> 32:10.399
A large capacitor bank.

32:10.467 --> 32:13.335
Some form of compression generator.

32:13.403 --> 32:16.105
What about a satellite dish?

32:16.173 --> 32:17.640
They have them all over town.

32:17.707 --> 32:19.675
Oh, no.

32:19.743 --> 32:22.645
Those are for television, dear.

32:22.712 --> 32:24.447
Given how little there is to do here,

32:24.514 --> 32:26.348
I imagine they watch a lot of it.

32:27.851 --> 32:30.319
What we're looking for
is something that could

32:30.387 --> 32:34.090
relay the discharge from
the microwave conversion

32:34.157 --> 32:35.558
of large energy pulses.

32:35.625 --> 32:38.727
What about a... a big antenna?

32:38.795 --> 32:41.530
Yes, yes, that would do, I suppose.

32:41.598 --> 32:45.668
Something like that?

32:56.113 --> 33:00.282
Well done, Astrid.

33:04.921 --> 33:09.024
Are you sure we should just
knock on the door like this?

33:11.628 --> 33:12.862
"Rose."

33:12.929 --> 33:16.665
That was Edward's daughter.

33:16.733 --> 33:19.101
He used to carry her around
the lab on his shoulders.

33:19.169 --> 33:21.871
Oh, hello.

33:21.938 --> 33:24.206
Is your mother home?

33:24.274 --> 33:26.242
No.

33:26.309 --> 33:31.947
Ah. But your mother is
Rose? And your grandfather,

33:32.015 --> 33:33.816
his name was Edward Cobb?

33:33.884 --> 33:35.017
Who are you?

33:35.085 --> 33:37.653
I'm Walter bishop.

33:37.721 --> 33:39.355
Your grandfather was a friend of mine.

33:39.422 --> 33:41.023
May we come in?

33:51.168 --> 33:54.737
Look, look. That's Edward Cobb.

33:54.804 --> 33:56.705
And... and that's Rose.

33:56.773 --> 33:58.274
Mm.

33:58.341 --> 34:01.243
Do you have more recent
pictures of your mother?

34:01.311 --> 34:02.745
We don't own a camera.

34:02.812 --> 34:04.747
No, of course.

34:04.814 --> 34:06.916
Cameras have no optic nerve.

34:06.983 --> 34:09.018
The photos would only
show their deformities.

34:09.085 --> 34:10.853
You have to go.

34:10.920 --> 34:13.121
- I'm not supposed to have strangers in the house.
- Quite right.

34:13.190 --> 34:15.925
But may I use your bathroom?

34:15.992 --> 34:18.726
You know my mother will be home soon.

34:18.795 --> 34:20.728
You should go. We will.

34:20.797 --> 34:23.565
First I'll go, and then we'll go.

34:23.632 --> 34:27.770
But where's the bathroom?

34:27.837 --> 34:29.972
Down the hall, second door on the left.

34:30.040 --> 34:33.007
Thank you.

34:38.815 --> 34:42.284
Is that operation?

34:42.351 --> 34:45.987
Oh, I loved this game.

34:47.456 --> 34:49.190
Joe Falls is in his 30s,

34:49.259 --> 34:50.693
so he's too young to
be one of the soldiers

34:50.760 --> 34:51.994
they tested in that experiment.

34:52.062 --> 34:54.663
Yeah, it would have had
to have been his father.

34:54.731 --> 34:56.998
I guess folks with
that kind of deformity

34:57.067 --> 34:59.335
don't tend to leave home.

35:02.038 --> 35:04.974
You still stuck on that census data?

35:05.041 --> 35:07.643
There's just something
weird about these numbers

35:07.711 --> 35:09.311
I went back 30 years,

35:09.379 --> 35:11.380
and it looks like the only
time the population goes down

35:11.448 --> 35:12.748
is when somebody dies.

35:12.816 --> 35:14.984
What about when people move?

35:15.051 --> 35:19.355
No, that's just it. They don't.

35:19.422 --> 35:20.956
Nobody ever leaves this town.

35:21.024 --> 35:23.292
Are you saying that you think they're...

35:23.360 --> 35:25.561
that everyone in Edina is one of them?

35:32.202 --> 35:33.202
Get down!

35:42.180 --> 35:43.280
We'll take cover in the barn!

35:43.348 --> 35:45.049
Go! Go!

36:30.595 --> 36:32.096
Oops.

36:32.163 --> 36:35.366
My turn.

36:38.603 --> 36:41.271
I'm going for the wishbone.

36:47.412 --> 36:49.880
Oh, my.

37:18.476 --> 37:21.345
Easy! Easy! It's just me.

37:24.649 --> 37:27.284
Drop the gun.

37:31.122 --> 37:32.956
I said drop the gun.

37:38.596 --> 37:40.097
Go home, Rose.

37:55.013 --> 37:57.114
The original pulse
deformed the whole town.

37:57.182 --> 38:01.785
My father couldn't live
with himself afterwards.

38:01.853 --> 38:04.521
He couldn't leave all
those people like that.

38:06.624 --> 38:08.625
According to our files,
your father resigned

38:08.693 --> 38:10.594
from his commission in 1979.

38:10.662 --> 38:11.662
Yes.

38:11.730 --> 38:13.297
He came back to Edina

38:13.364 --> 38:15.232
and worked tirelessly on his machine

38:15.300 --> 38:17.201
until he perfected it.

38:17.268 --> 38:20.304
Then he offered the
inhabitants a choice.

38:20.371 --> 38:22.673
A choice?

38:22.741 --> 38:25.909
Live as you are, deformed,
but free to roam the world,

38:25.977 --> 38:29.246
or confine yourself to Edina,

38:29.314 --> 38:32.983
where the pulse will allow
you to hide in broad daylight.

38:33.051 --> 38:36.787
And the people voted to stay.

38:36.855 --> 38:38.188
They realized the pulse
would allow them to look

38:38.256 --> 38:39.857
beyond the horror of their deformities

38:39.924 --> 38:43.660
and see each other for
who they really were.

38:43.728 --> 38:46.730
They chose the only normal
life they could have.

38:46.798 --> 38:48.799
And your father?

38:48.867 --> 38:51.034
He chose to stay among you.

38:51.102 --> 38:53.771
He chose because of
you, didn't he, Rose?

38:56.274 --> 39:01.512
Last time I saw you,
you were a little girl.

39:01.579 --> 39:06.316
A perfectly healthy little girl.

39:06.384 --> 39:10.721
My mother and I, we lived in Edina.

39:10.789 --> 39:12.456
We were part of the experiment.

39:12.524 --> 39:14.691
Your father experimented on you?

39:14.759 --> 39:17.194
No. The army never told him

39:17.262 --> 39:19.797
they were expanding
the scope of the test.

39:22.433 --> 39:28.705
Rose, I remember your father fondly.

39:28.773 --> 39:34.378
He believed that
invisibility would save lives.

39:34.445 --> 39:38.448
And he finally solved the problem.

39:40.785 --> 39:44.822
My father tried to create
a good life for me here...

39:44.889 --> 39:48.692
for all of us... and he succeeded.

40:19.991 --> 40:22.259
Dr. Bishop?

40:22.327 --> 40:25.162
You can't make this
public, Agent Broyles.

40:25.230 --> 40:28.265
We need to let them keep their secret.

40:28.333 --> 40:30.634
Dr. Bishop, three state
troopers were killed.

40:30.702 --> 40:34.271
And those responsible
were brought to justice.

40:34.339 --> 40:36.874
But the rest of these people...

40:36.941 --> 40:40.110
You have no idea what will
happen to them. Dr. Bishop...

40:40.178 --> 40:43.046
they will have no choice
but to study these people.

40:43.114 --> 40:46.416
To examine them, to test
them, to humiliate them.

40:53.892 --> 40:56.393
Dr. Bishop, did you find the machine?

40:56.461 --> 40:59.763
The one that transforms them?

40:59.831 --> 41:05.002
Please, Agent Broyles.

41:05.069 --> 41:07.838
These people have been harmed enough.

41:07.906 --> 41:11.675
- We simply can't...
- Dr. Bishop...

41:11.743 --> 41:16.313
I don't think you're understanding me.

41:16.381 --> 41:18.982
If you didn't find the machine,

41:19.050 --> 41:22.286
there's nothing to report.

41:29.661 --> 41:32.329
Thank you.

41:55.320 --> 41:57.788
Remarkable...

41:57.855 --> 42:00.524
How Rose was willing
to expose her secret

42:00.591 --> 42:04.328
to right a wrong.

42:04.395 --> 42:05.762
How very brave of her.

42:08.099 --> 42:10.634
You did something brave too.

42:10.702 --> 42:12.269
The way you spoke up for those people...

42:12.337 --> 42:13.670
you didn't have to do that, Walter.

42:16.941 --> 42:20.243
I'm proud of you.

42:23.614 --> 42:27.651
I'm glad you choose to
see me the way you do.

42:33.291 --> 42:36.893
Very glad indeed.
