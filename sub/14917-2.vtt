<i>Previously on Brothers and Sisters:</i>

00:03.753 --> 00:05.482
- Let's adopt.
- Oh, Robert.

00:05.622 --> 00:08.318
We have a 20 million dollar loan
hanging over our heads.

00:08.458 --> 00:10.255
Cuts have to be made
across the board.

00:10.393 --> 00:13.191
- We are looking at the legal team.
- You mean Kevin?

00:13.329 --> 00:16.856
Dad does have another child out there.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.527
- It is better if everything is out in the open.
- Rebecca and I have started dating.

00:20.670 --> 00:22.103
Justin, not now.
- What?

00:22.238 --> 00:24.968
I am done keeping the family secrets.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.803
- Sarah.
- He's letting you go, Kevin.

00:26.943 --> 00:28.205
Oh, Sarah.
- What?

00:28.344 --> 00:31.472
We're making cuts at Ojai.
Restructuring.

00:31.614 --> 00:33.081
Oh, my God.

00:33.216 --> 00:34.581
William had another lover.

00:34.718 --> 00:36.777
And they had a child together.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.251
I don't believe you.

00:38.655 --> 00:39.883
Yes, you do.

00:49.499 --> 00:50.659
Are you gonna get that?

00:50.800 --> 00:53.928
Oh, no. I don't want to.

00:55.472 --> 00:58.498
You know,
it's like the fourth call in an hour.

00:58.641 --> 01:00.108
Oh, fine.

01:00.243 --> 01:01.733
Fine.

01:04.681 --> 01:06.512
It's my mother. Again.

01:06.950 --> 01:08.508
Maybe something's wrong.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.177
She can't take a hint.
That's what's wrong.

01:11.521 --> 01:12.613
I know you're angry at her,

01:12.756 --> 01:14.485
- but she's your mom.
- If I pick up now,

01:14.624 --> 01:17.525
she's gonna make me feel guilty,
then I'm gonna give her a second chance.

01:17.660 --> 01:20.458
And she is inevitably gonna do
something awful.

01:20.597 --> 01:22.121
That's just the story of my life.

01:22.265 --> 01:25.200
But I really don't wanna talk about this
right now.

01:25.535 --> 01:27.400
Oh, you know what?
I should get going.

01:27.537 --> 01:28.663
Wait. You're leaving?

01:28.805 --> 01:30.932
Yeah,
I have a meeting tomorrow morning.

01:31.074 --> 01:32.132
Early, so...

01:32.275 --> 01:34.835
- We haven't even finished the movie.
- Oh, I've seen it before.

01:34.978 --> 01:37.708
The evil robots die,
and the hero gets the girl.

01:37.847 --> 01:39.508
I've seen it like a thousand times.

01:39.649 --> 01:42.117
So I'll call you when I get home, okay?

01:42.252 --> 01:43.844
I'm gonna go.

01:47.957 --> 01:50.482
- You guys haven't had sex yet?
- Can you not sound so shocked?

01:50.627 --> 01:52.424
We haven't been together
that long, Sarah.

01:52.562 --> 01:54.962
- Sorry, I just assumed you had.
- Well, we haven't, okay?

01:55.098 --> 01:57.089
- Okay, good, good.
- Good?

01:57.233 --> 01:58.564
That's all you've got, is good?

01:58.701 --> 02:01.169
No, I've also got clean socks, finally.

02:01.304 --> 02:03.534
Okay, you know what?
You're right, it's...

02:03.673 --> 02:05.436
Sarah, it's weird.

02:05.575 --> 02:08.339
I didn't say it was weird.
I didn't say anything.

02:08.478 --> 02:11.072
You know, I didn't even want
to be having this conversation.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.408
Look, come on, Sarah.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.449
My bedroom's had a revolving door
since puberty.

02:14.584 --> 02:16.848
- My mattress is crash-tested.
- Thank you.

02:16.986 --> 02:19.284
- Not an image I needed.
- Like, this is usually my thing.

02:19.422 --> 02:20.946
And I don't know why, but I'm...

02:21.090 --> 02:23.217
- What?
- I'm confused.

02:23.359 --> 02:24.826
Are you really surprised?

02:24.961 --> 02:26.929
Ten minutes ago,
you were practically related.

02:27.063 --> 02:28.621
Okay, we were never related, all right?

02:28.765 --> 02:30.699
And that was months ago,
and we're over that.

02:30.834 --> 02:32.199
We're really over that.

02:32.335 --> 02:33.768
I don't know what to say, Justin.

02:33.903 --> 02:36.201
Maybe you should speak to Tommy,
or ask Kevin.

02:36.339 --> 02:38.432
Have you ever gotten sex advice
from Kevin?

02:38.575 --> 02:39.633
- No.
- Yeah.

02:39.776 --> 02:41.676
And Tommy?
He'd never let me hear the end of it.

02:41.811 --> 02:43.278
I'm not asking for sex tips, okay?

02:43.413 --> 02:45.347
I'm asking you for relationship advice.

02:45.481 --> 02:47.244
You're my sister.
That's what sisters do.

02:47.383 --> 02:49.408
They give relationship advice. Help me.

02:50.053 --> 02:51.714
Okay.

02:53.223 --> 02:55.020
Well, you have a complicated history.

02:55.158 --> 02:57.058
The last couple of relationships
you've been in,

02:57.193 --> 03:00.788
you were either using
or it was self-destructive.

03:01.497 --> 03:02.623
That's true.

03:02.765 --> 03:04.790
You're with someone you care about.

03:04.934 --> 03:06.595
You don't wanna screw it up.

03:06.736 --> 03:09.102
All right. So, what do I do?

03:09.239 --> 03:10.604
I'm not gonna tell you what to do,

03:10.740 --> 03:13.732
but if you're asking this many questions,
maybe you should take it slow.

03:17.046 --> 03:18.946
Hey, Kitty.

03:19.082 --> 03:20.140
Oh, hey.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.183
I thought you weren't coming home
until morning.

03:22.318 --> 03:24.684
- I got out early, what are you doing?
- Oh, baby-proofing.

03:24.821 --> 03:26.550
The social worker's gonna do
a safety check.

03:26.689 --> 03:29.385
Okay, I've got outlet covers,
corner guards,

03:29.525 --> 03:33.291
lock box for medicine cabinet,
toilet seat latches.

03:33.429 --> 03:35.590
Done, done, done and done.

03:35.732 --> 03:38.394
- How did the vote go?
- Oh, lower emissions passed.

03:38.534 --> 03:40.001
And with only one highway to nowhere

03:40.136 --> 03:43.105
and a government building named
after Senator Issendrac's kid.

03:43.239 --> 03:44.433
I heard a rumor...

03:44.574 --> 03:46.542
By the way,
the social worker's gonna be here at 2

03:46.676 --> 03:48.473
and I'm gonna go see my mom
about the menu.

03:48.611 --> 03:51.136
I'm gonna be back by noon
and everybody's coming at 5,

03:51.281 --> 03:54.307
which means 6, but that will work
because dinner's at 6:30.

03:54.450 --> 03:57.214
- Think it's a good idea to invite them?
- Yeah, I think it's great.

03:57.353 --> 04:00.151
- I think that having a stable, loving...
- Stable?

04:00.290 --> 04:02.315
I don't want another scene
like the beach house.

04:02.458 --> 04:05.018
But everybody knows how important
tomorrow night is and...

04:05.161 --> 04:07.186
- Even Sarah?
- Well, you know Sarah.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.821
She feels so bad about not writing
that recommendation letter,

04:09.966 --> 04:12.332
that she will do anything I want
and, oh...

04:12.468 --> 04:14.663
God, I gotta figure out
what I'm gonna wear.

04:15.538 --> 04:18.098
Hey, you could wear a muumuu.

04:18.241 --> 04:20.038
People are still gonna know
you're a good mom.

04:20.176 --> 04:23.043
Oh, well, I don't know about that,
but, well, you know,

04:23.179 --> 04:25.909
I am a pretty great communications
director. I put the questions

04:26.049 --> 04:29.109
for the Commerce Committee and the
National Response proposal on your desk.

04:29.252 --> 04:31.311
Did you say something about a rumor?

04:31.454 --> 04:35.083
Yeah, apparently, somebody on the staff
is shopping a book about the campaign.

04:35.224 --> 04:37.192
So would you get into that for me?

04:44.300 --> 04:48.396
Morning. I come bearing gifts.

04:51.307 --> 04:53.241
Well, so much for trimming the fat
around here.

04:53.643 --> 04:56.908
About that.
I wanted to clear the air between us.

04:57.046 --> 04:58.775
Kevin didn't deserve to be fired, Holly.

04:58.915 --> 05:00.815
Well, I wish I had another choice.

05:00.950 --> 05:03.544
I know that this has been hard on you.

05:03.686 --> 05:05.210
You and I know each other too long

05:05.355 --> 05:08.381
for me to believe that you came here
to commiserate with me about my nephew

05:08.524 --> 05:10.185
and to watch me eat doughnuts.

05:11.861 --> 05:14.853
This other woman
that William was seeing,

05:14.998 --> 05:16.329
what did you know about her?

05:19.135 --> 05:20.363
Nothing.

05:20.503 --> 05:23.165
You worked with him for decades.
You knew about me.

05:23.306 --> 05:24.898
You must have known something.

05:25.375 --> 05:28.208
- I can't help you, Holly.
- Come on, you can tell me.

05:28.344 --> 05:30.608
Was she the only one?

05:31.114 --> 05:33.582
Was William a part of Ryan's life?

05:33.716 --> 05:35.206
This is driving you crazy, isn't it?

05:36.252 --> 05:37.776
Good.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.855
Now you know how Nora felt
when she found out about you.

05:44.460 --> 05:46.894
Listen, if you wanna get these reports
by the end of the day,

05:47.030 --> 05:49.760
I should get back to work. Um...

05:51.034 --> 05:53.093
Thank you for the breakfast.

06:01.177 --> 06:03.839
How about veal piccata
with a side of capellini?

06:03.980 --> 06:05.447
Oh, too heavy, too much cholesterol.

06:05.581 --> 06:07.674
- And baby cows? No.
- Oh.

06:07.817 --> 06:08.943
All right.

06:09.085 --> 06:11.747
How about this?
Cedar plank salmon with ginger glaze?

06:11.888 --> 06:13.549
Yeah, but potentially full of mercury.

06:13.689 --> 06:17.147
I just want her to think
that I'm totally up on all the health issues.

06:17.293 --> 06:20.888
Well, that just leaves us with chicken.
How about chicken paprika?

06:21.030 --> 06:22.793
- Oh, it's simple, homey.
- Perfect.

06:22.932 --> 06:26.493
Perfect, just make sure that it's organic,
free-range and antibiotic-free.

06:27.136 --> 06:28.262
All right, I will this time.

06:28.404 --> 06:30.964
But, Kitty, you really have to learn your way
around the kitchen.

06:31.107 --> 06:32.233
No, absol... Look.

06:32.375 --> 06:34.843
You have his number,
so track him down.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.877
- Call me later. Bye.
- What are you doing?

06:37.013 --> 06:40.676
I thought I was the one to decide
whether to contact Ryan Lafferty...

06:40.817 --> 06:42.148
I'm not tracking my half-brother.

06:42.285 --> 06:44.981
I'm trying to track clients
because my full-brother downsized me.

06:45.121 --> 06:46.349
- Oh, Kevin...
- Don't worry.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.320
I will be civil to Tommy tonight,

06:48.458 --> 06:50.824
despite the fact
that I don't have Scotty there as a buffer.

06:50.960 --> 06:53.258
- But speaking of Ryan Lafferty...
- Stop it.

06:53.396 --> 06:56.456
Stop it now, you can't badger me
into making a decision.

06:56.599 --> 06:58.226
Look, I think we're all a little curious.

06:58.367 --> 07:01.632
If Rebecca is not our half-sister,
we need to know who it is.

07:01.771 --> 07:05.036
I kind of got used to the fact
that there's six of us now.

07:05.174 --> 07:06.903
<i>Kind of like The Brady Bunch.</i>

07:07.043 --> 07:08.908
- Oh, well, Jan...
- Marcia.

07:09.045 --> 07:11.605
<i>Why don't you ask Rebecca
if the Brady Bunch fantasy</i>

07:11.747 --> 07:13.544
was all that it was cracked up to be?

07:13.683 --> 07:15.810
I just wanted to know if Mom
had made a decision yet.

07:15.952 --> 07:17.010
I haven't.

07:17.153 --> 07:19.348
I can't believe
that we are having this conversation.

07:19.489 --> 07:23.084
Why don't we just open up a foster home
for all of Dad's illegitimate offspring?

07:23.226 --> 07:25.626
Well, there's only one. Please, God.

07:25.761 --> 07:28.525
And, Kevin,
we are not talking about him today.

07:28.664 --> 07:32.794
Today we are only talking about Kitty's
baby and my future grandbaby,

07:32.935 --> 07:37.304
which is why I'm off to the market
to buy the world's healthiest chicken.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.839
Oh, I love you, Mom.
- I love you.

07:38.975 --> 07:40.306
- I'll see you soon.
Thank you.

07:40.443 --> 07:42.411
- Bye.
- Okay.

07:42.812 --> 07:44.803
- Bye.
- You're certainly chummy.

07:44.947 --> 07:48.314
Oh, well, you know,
hopefully I'm about to have a child.

07:48.451 --> 07:49.816
And I guess that makes you closer.

07:49.952 --> 07:53.888
And, plus, I need Nora Supermom
to impress the social worker.

07:54.023 --> 07:55.854
You know what? I'm a nervous wreck.

07:55.992 --> 07:58.654
You're married to a U.S. Senator.
Why don't you just cut the line?

07:58.794 --> 08:00.557
Because that's not how it works,
Kevin, okay?

08:00.696 --> 08:03.164
We had to jump through the same hoops
as everybody else.

08:03.299 --> 08:04.926
- That is...
- Yeah.

08:07.136 --> 08:08.694
Okay.

08:08.871 --> 08:10.338
Um...

08:10.573 --> 08:14.031
It's not just about that.

08:14.177 --> 08:16.941
I accidentally wrote a book
about Robert and the campaign.

08:18.814 --> 08:20.076
Okay.

08:20.216 --> 08:22.184
How do you accidentally write a book?

08:22.318 --> 08:24.980
I don't know, I was having lunch
with my friend Tracy, who does...

08:25.121 --> 08:27.988
- She does happen to be a book agent.
- That's convenient.

08:28.124 --> 08:31.218
And I was telling her all about
how boring it is on the campaign trail

08:31.360 --> 08:34.818
and, you know, how get stuck in hotels
and airplanes.

08:34.964 --> 08:37.797
And I was telling her
how I would write down my thoughts.

08:37.933 --> 08:40.698
And then,
she asked me to send them to her and...

08:40.836 --> 08:42.303
And, voilà, a book?

08:42.438 --> 08:46.397
Yeah, she sort of took all my thoughts,
and she organized them into chapters.

08:46.576 --> 08:47.634
Wow. Okay, so, what is it?

08:47.777 --> 08:50.769
Some steamy tell-all
exposing all the smut and depravity

08:50.913 --> 08:52.005
from presidential politics?

08:52.148 --> 08:55.640
No, it is an exploration
of the state of politics.

08:55.785 --> 08:56.945
Oh, no depravity?

08:57.086 --> 09:00.249
No, not that I remember, no.
No smut either.

09:00.389 --> 09:01.856
Then that's a shame.

09:01.991 --> 09:04.152
Okay, so, what's the...?

09:05.761 --> 09:08.059
Oh, Robert doesn't know yet.

09:08.197 --> 09:10.961
No. No, he wants me
to find out who wrote it.

09:11.100 --> 09:14.797
Ooh. Okay, well,
just explain what happened to him.

09:14.937 --> 09:17.098
He's a politician.
They're used to being written about.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.174
And if it's as dull as you say it is,
I'm sure...

09:19.308 --> 09:22.209
No, no, no.
No, no, I never said it was dull.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.978
Oh, well, I'm sure he'll just be happy
it's you and not someone else.

09:26.115 --> 09:28.242
No, you're right.
God, I hope you're right.

09:29.585 --> 09:30.711
- It is...
- I think it's you.

09:30.853 --> 09:32.343
Hello?

09:32.488 --> 09:34.979
Hey, honey. You know, listen, I...

09:35.124 --> 09:37.615
No, not over the phone. Face-to-face.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.921
No, no. What?

09:40.062 --> 09:41.893
Oh, God, you're kidding me.

09:42.031 --> 09:44.192
All right, all right.
No, no, I'm leaving now.

09:44.333 --> 09:45.527
Okay, bye.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.465
- What?
- There's an accident on the 101.

09:47.603 --> 09:49.400
I've gotta get there
before the social worker.

09:49.538 --> 09:51.802
Please, 5:00.
If you love me, you'll be there early.

09:51.941 --> 09:54.034
Okay, if you love me,
you won't sit me next to Tommy.

09:54.176 --> 09:55.507
Don't be late, Kevin.

09:55.645 --> 10:00.241
- Goodbye.
- You forgot your book.

10:15.631 --> 10:17.292
Oh, my God.

10:22.471 --> 10:24.735
She told me to meet her
at her office at 1.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.569
Like I've been summoned
to the principal's.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.371
- She didn't tell you what it's about?
- No, why did I agree to go?

10:29.512 --> 10:31.503
All she does
is make me feel lousy about myself.

10:31.647 --> 10:32.739
Yeah, same with me.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.180
One look from my dad,
and I could feel his disappointment.

10:35.618 --> 10:37.779
I mean, look,
the good news is you get it over with,

10:37.920 --> 10:39.888
then we can go to Kitty's,
take the scenic route.

10:40.423 --> 10:41.856
Hey, why don't we spend the night?

10:41.991 --> 10:45.188
Maybe get a motel room,
go surfing in the morning.

10:45.328 --> 10:46.761
Just you and me?

10:46.896 --> 10:48.386
No, me, you and my mom.

10:48.531 --> 10:50.294
Come on,
I need something to look forward to.

10:50.433 --> 10:52.526
It could be our first little getaway.

10:53.602 --> 10:54.864
Okay. Yeah, okay.

10:55.004 --> 10:56.335
That'd be cool.

10:56.806 --> 10:59.001
I'm not gonna make it up the hill
with my knee.

10:59.141 --> 11:00.540
So I'll meet you at the car, okay?

11:00.676 --> 11:02.769
Cool. I'll book the motel room later,
all right?

11:02.912 --> 11:04.846
- It will be fun.
- Yep.

11:06.048 --> 11:07.242
Oh, my God.

11:07.383 --> 11:08.873
I gotta call Sarah.

11:09.018 --> 11:10.246
Here.

11:10.386 --> 11:11.751
When does she want it done by?

11:11.887 --> 11:13.047
End of the day.

11:13.189 --> 11:14.247
She's unbelievable.

11:14.390 --> 11:15.448
She fires half the staff

11:15.591 --> 11:17.525
and just expects me
to pick up on all the work.

11:17.660 --> 11:19.594
She wants to make sure
our profit margins are up.

11:19.729 --> 11:21.196
- And then she'll chill, all right?
- Justin.

11:22.498 --> 11:23.760
- All right, I'll wait.
- Yep.

11:23.899 --> 11:26.595
Okay, so that "take it slow" plan?
Not happening.

11:26.736 --> 11:29.034
- I don't have time for this now.
- No, I don't have time.

11:29.171 --> 11:31.833
She wants to spend the night
in Santa Barbara and get a motel room.

11:31.974 --> 11:33.168
A motel room?

11:33.309 --> 11:35.709
Rebecca wants to have sex with him.
He's freaking out.

11:36.045 --> 11:37.979
- Why?
- Because he likes her.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.172
Okay, so, what do I do?

11:39.315 --> 11:42.648
Well, whatever happens will be fine.

11:42.785 --> 11:44.116
I don't want fine, okay?

11:44.253 --> 11:47.086
Fine is for the girl you meet at a bar
and you don't remember her name.

11:47.223 --> 11:48.554
Fine is not fine for this.

11:48.691 --> 11:51.751
It's actually not even in the vicinity of fine,
Sarah.

11:51.894 --> 11:53.486
- He's losing his mind.
- Give me that.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.756
No, stop it. Hey.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.760
Listen, you're putting
way too much pressure on yourself.

11:58.901 --> 12:02.166
All right, so, what do I do?
Do I get, like, candles and massage oils?

12:02.571 --> 12:03.663
He's talking massage oil.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.797
All right, that's it. Give me the phone.

12:05.941 --> 12:07.704
- What is wrong with you?
- What are you...?

12:07.843 --> 12:10.004
Rebecca is smoking hot,
she wants to have sex with you.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.444
It's not complicated. Just do it.

12:12.581 --> 12:14.412
<i>- Could you put Sarah back on?
- No.</i>

12:14.550 --> 12:15.778
You are acting like a girl.

12:15.918 --> 12:20.014
So just cut the melodrama
and get busy.

12:21.323 --> 12:25.123
All right. So by the end of the day.

12:33.602 --> 12:35.536
Kevin Walker, don't you have a job?

12:35.671 --> 12:38.504
I was just texting.
You don't even need an office these days.

12:38.641 --> 12:39.699
Give me a break.

12:39.842 --> 12:44.108
You were just lying in wait,
trying to pester me about Ryan.

12:44.246 --> 12:45.907
- What?
- Honestly, Kevin.

12:46.048 --> 12:47.675
You are impossible.

12:47.817 --> 12:49.682
Impossible?

12:49.819 --> 12:51.616
How about argumentative
and unreasonable?

12:53.556 --> 12:55.547
- I didn't say that.
- But you're not disagreeing.

12:55.691 --> 12:57.591
- Why are you being sensitive?
- I am sensitive.

12:57.726 --> 13:00.320
What I'm not is argumentative
and unreasonable.

13:00.463 --> 13:01.521
Yes, I do have opinions,

13:01.664 --> 13:04.656
but that does not make me contrary
for the sake of being a contrarian.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.030
- Are you and Scotty fighting?
- What? No.

13:07.169 --> 13:09.797
Despite what some people think,
I actually don't like fighting.

13:09.939 --> 13:11.873
I have to go.

13:12.007 --> 13:13.975
Well, have a good day.

13:14.109 --> 13:16.839
- I'll see you at Kitty's.
- Woop-dee-doo.

13:21.784 --> 13:22.876
- Hey.
Hey.

13:24.553 --> 13:26.384
It's so good to see you.

13:27.289 --> 13:28.722
So, what's so important?

13:29.892 --> 13:32.417
Okay, no small talk.

13:32.561 --> 13:35.462
This is Alan Simms, my attorney.

13:35.598 --> 13:38.294
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

13:39.134 --> 13:41.102
So, what am I here for?

13:41.770 --> 13:45.729
I have asked Alan
to revise the terms of your trust.

13:46.709 --> 13:47.767
You're cutting me off?

13:47.910 --> 13:49.775
Your mother is removing herself
as conservator,

13:49.912 --> 13:52.574
along with all conditions attached.

13:52.715 --> 13:53.943
English, please?

13:54.083 --> 13:55.948
The $2 million that's in the trust

13:56.085 --> 13:58.280
that you were gonna get
when you were 25,

13:58.420 --> 14:00.012
you don't have to wait any longer.

14:00.155 --> 14:02.623
- It's yours.
- Uh...

14:02.892 --> 14:04.860
Wait, I don't understand.
What's the catch?

14:04.994 --> 14:06.621
There are no stipulations.

14:06.762 --> 14:09.856
Your mother's giving you the money
outright.

14:11.967 --> 14:13.491
Um...

14:15.504 --> 14:17.472
- Could you give us a second?
- Right.

14:21.677 --> 14:22.871
Why are you doing this?

14:23.245 --> 14:25.236
I wanna make sure that you're all right.

14:25.381 --> 14:26.746
No, I'm great, Mom. I'm great.

14:26.882 --> 14:29.908
Now I can actually go shopping
and buy a fancy car.

14:30.052 --> 14:31.246
Everything's perfect.

14:31.387 --> 14:35.414
Why can't you just accept this gift
in the spirit that it's being given?

14:35.558 --> 14:37.549
Which is what?
To buy a relationship back with me?

14:37.693 --> 14:41.220
Mom, you never give anything
without expecting something in return.

14:41.363 --> 14:43.957
Rebecca, I want you to take this

14:44.099 --> 14:49.162
and create the kind of life
that you want for yourself.

14:49.638 --> 14:52.129
I don't believe
that that's why you're giving it to me.

14:54.944 --> 15:00.382
You know, when you're ready
to have a real relationship with me,

15:00.516 --> 15:01.710
I'll be here.

15:01.850 --> 15:05.946
But that has nothing to do
with why I am giving you this.

15:06.188 --> 15:07.849
This is yours.

15:08.724 --> 15:10.351
You do whatever you want with it.

15:28.110 --> 15:33.013
This meal is going to be so spectacular,
your dishes will be in culture shock.

15:33.148 --> 15:35.412
- You do have dishes, don't you?
- Yes, yes, Mom.

15:35.551 --> 15:37.451
And we also have pots and pans too.

15:37.586 --> 15:41.078
Listen, did I happen to leave my bag there,
by any chance?

15:41.223 --> 15:43.555
<i>- Yes.
- Oh, thank God.</i>

15:43.692 --> 15:47.219
Do you think that maybe you could bring it
with you tonight? And you know what?

15:47.363 --> 15:48.421
<i>Can you zip it up?</i>

15:48.564 --> 15:50.088
I have some...

15:50.766 --> 15:52.131
...tampons in there.

15:52.267 --> 15:54.201
Kitty, I can handle tampons.

15:54.336 --> 15:56.201
<i>- It has not been that...
- Okay.</i>

15:56.338 --> 15:58.636
I don't wanna keep you
from your paprika chicken.

15:58.774 --> 15:59.832
<i>And thank you.</i>

15:59.975 --> 16:01.704
And I'll see you tonight.

16:01.844 --> 16:04.074
Yeah, see you later.

16:15.991 --> 16:17.481
Huh.

16:34.743 --> 16:36.506
- You look handsome.
- Thank you.

16:36.645 --> 16:38.545
Sufficiently dad-like?

16:38.681 --> 16:39.739
You know, honey,

16:39.882 --> 16:42.146
you're not gonna have to worry one iota
about that book

16:42.284 --> 16:43.717
because it's not a tell-all.

16:43.852 --> 16:48.653
It just explores American politics
and the fractured electorate.

16:48.791 --> 16:50.122
Oh, so you read it?

16:50.259 --> 16:55.697
Well, um, you know,
actually, that's a very funny story.

16:55.831 --> 16:58.356
I wrote it.

16:58.834 --> 17:01.200
- You wrote a book about me?
- No, I didn't write about you.

17:01.336 --> 17:04.305
- I hear about it from my staff?
- It's not about you, it's about family.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.806
Honey, if you read it and don't like it,
I won't publish it.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.307
I don't even know what's worse,

17:08.444 --> 17:10.935
that you wrote a book about me
or that you're telling me about it now

17:11.079 --> 17:13.241
two minutes before the social worker
is supposed to be here.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.244
I... I love you?

17:18.387 --> 17:19.547
Unbelievable.

17:24.460 --> 17:29.625
Well, I haven't seen a home
this thoroughly baby-proofed, ever.

17:29.765 --> 17:31.232
Well, Kitty did it all herself.

17:31.366 --> 17:33.459
- She's a self-starter.
- Oh.

17:33.602 --> 17:35.229
So how long have you two
been married?

17:35.370 --> 17:36.428
- A year.
- Eight months.

17:36.572 --> 17:39.700
Well, yes. Okay, yes,
Robert's right, eight months.

17:39.842 --> 17:43.403
But you know that time actually does fly
when you're having fun?

17:44.980 --> 17:46.607
Is that a problem?

17:46.749 --> 17:48.740
Well, we generally prefer
our prospective parents

17:48.884 --> 17:52.081
be married at least two years,
but it's not written in stone.

17:52.588 --> 17:53.714
- Good.
- Well, it does...

17:53.856 --> 17:57.019
It does feel
like we've been together forever.

17:57.726 --> 17:58.988
- Soul mates, huh?
Yeah.

17:59.128 --> 18:01.255
Yeah, you know what?
We tell each other everything.

18:01.396 --> 18:03.023
No secrets, no lies.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.928
Just love.

18:05.067 --> 18:06.125
So, Robert,

18:06.268 --> 18:08.862
you split your time between D.C.
And California about fifty-fifty?

18:09.004 --> 18:11.268
- That's about right.
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.702
I'm sorry, but that's not right.

18:13.842 --> 18:15.935
No, it's more like seventy-thirty.

18:16.078 --> 18:18.171
Especially when the Senate
isn't in session.

18:18.313 --> 18:21.544
And if you count vacations,
then it's about eighty-twenty.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.947
Okay. And, Kitty,
I know you work for Robert.

18:24.086 --> 18:25.610
So does that mean you travel with him?

18:25.754 --> 18:27.016
No. Oh, no.

18:27.156 --> 18:30.057
No, I'm just his eyes and ears
right here in California.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.717
Yeah, but it is amazing
how much she gets done when I'm away.

18:32.861 --> 18:36.558
Oh. Oh, but, yeah, it's true. I'm a doer.

18:36.698 --> 18:39.758
So I have to ask because
I know you're a vocal NRA supporter,

18:39.902 --> 18:40.960
do you own firearms?

18:41.103 --> 18:42.832
- I do.
- No.

18:43.472 --> 18:44.769
Well, I don't.

18:44.907 --> 18:47.205
And it's not like Robert's a gun freak
or anything.

18:47.342 --> 18:50.209
I mean, yes, he's shot a couple of quail.

18:50.345 --> 18:51.573
But, you know, really,

18:51.713 --> 18:54.546
there are loads of quail out there,
so a couple of quail...

18:54.683 --> 18:57.345
My guns are completely secure.
They're behind five locks.

18:57.486 --> 18:59.750
I can get rid of them if you'd like.
Family's a priority.

18:59.888 --> 19:01.981
Yes. Yes, family's a priority.

19:02.124 --> 19:05.582
And that's why we've invited
my entire family here for dinner tonight.

19:05.727 --> 19:07.627
- Ah.
- They are the most warm,

19:07.763 --> 19:09.196
loving, supportive people

19:09.331 --> 19:10.593
that you could ever imagine.

19:10.732 --> 19:13.428
- That's wonderful.
- And my mother, a fantastic cook.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.434
Oh, yum, yum.

19:16.271 --> 19:19.240
You've gotta be kidding me.
That little b...

19:19.374 --> 19:20.602
Oh, Mom, something's burning?

19:20.742 --> 19:25.236
Oh. Oh! Oh, no. Oh, no.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.575
Look at that.

19:27.716 --> 19:28.876
Well, those look terrible.

19:29.017 --> 19:30.712
Maybe I could scrape...

19:30.853 --> 19:33.185
Oh, no. They're ruined.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.755
All right. All right, fine.

19:36.892 --> 19:39.417
So we won't have a second vegetable.

19:39.561 --> 19:41.688
And you know what? It serves her right.

19:41.830 --> 19:43.024
Who? Kitty?

19:43.165 --> 19:45.156
Yes, Kitty
who has me slaving away in this kitchen

19:45.300 --> 19:47.200
due to the fact
she can barely make toast.

19:47.336 --> 19:49.736
Because she's too busy
whoring this family

19:49.872 --> 19:51.305
for her own professional gain.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.702
Wait, Kitty's a whore?

19:53.075 --> 19:54.474
Whoring. Whoring.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.477
She's whoring me, she's whoring you.
She's whoring all of us.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.877
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about this.

20:00.015 --> 20:01.505
This.

20:01.984 --> 20:04.282
<i>A Family in Politics by Kitty Walker.</i>

20:04.419 --> 20:06.979
- Did she write that?
- Oh, yes, she wrote it.

20:07.122 --> 20:10.717
We all come off
like a bunch of ridiculous caricatures.

20:10.859 --> 20:11.951
Okay, listen.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.053
Let's see.

20:14.196 --> 20:18.633
"My mother, easily a blue-stater,
claims to be socially progressive.

20:18.767 --> 20:22.464
She's even got an arrest for possession
of marijuana under her belt. "

20:22.604 --> 20:23.662
What...?

20:23.805 --> 20:26.171
My criminal record
is now public knowledge?

20:26.308 --> 20:27.900
You know, it's a misdemeanor, Mom.

20:28.610 --> 20:30.601
Says the drug addict.

20:30.746 --> 20:32.771
- Mom, the pot.
- I know.

20:32.915 --> 20:34.177
No, that pot, Mom.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.806
Oh! Oh!

20:36.785 --> 20:39.618
Oh, God. Crap.

20:40.122 --> 20:41.783
Okay, where was I?

20:41.924 --> 20:43.585
- Hands off.
- Hands are off.

20:43.725 --> 20:45.625
Wait. Listen.

20:45.761 --> 20:47.194
"But look past what she says

20:47.329 --> 20:49.991
and she's the embodiment
of a '50s housewife,

20:50.132 --> 20:54.159
hiding herself behind cookbooks,
a perfectly decorated home,

20:54.303 --> 20:56.430
and five children. "

20:56.571 --> 20:58.266
She's calling me a hypocrite.

20:58.407 --> 21:01.376
I read three national newspapers
every morning,

21:01.510 --> 21:03.842
<i>not to mention my subscription
to The Economist.</i>

21:03.979 --> 21:06.379
She's got a point, though. I mean, you...

21:06.515 --> 21:09.075
- Mom, you kind of live in this kitchen.
- Oh, really?

21:09.217 --> 21:10.616
Really.

21:10.752 --> 21:12.652
Why don't I read you
what she says about you?

21:13.288 --> 21:15.119
What does she say about me?

21:15.257 --> 21:17.623
Justin, being impulsive
isn't the worst thing in the world.

21:17.759 --> 21:19.317
<i>Well, it's not just impulsive.</i>

21:19.461 --> 21:22.396
- It's immature, uninformed.
- Don't forget disaffected.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.055
And disaffected.

21:24.199 --> 21:26.190
Listen to this. You ready?

21:26.335 --> 21:27.597
"My brother's generation,

21:27.736 --> 21:31.001
while they may have their hearts
in the right place, are the easiest to sway

21:31.139 --> 21:34.666
because every decision is an impulsive,
emotional reaction.

21:34.810 --> 21:37.711
Did my baby brother really think
he was going to impress our dad

21:37.846 --> 21:39.643
because he enlisted after 9/11?"

21:39.781 --> 21:41.476
I didn't do it just to impress Dad.

21:41.616 --> 21:43.015
Of course you didn't.

21:43.151 --> 21:45.881
It's mean-spirited and condescending.

21:46.021 --> 21:48.546
She better stop
with this baby brother stuff too.

21:48.690 --> 21:50.055
Tell her about the foreplay.

21:50.192 --> 21:51.682
<i>- Did Mom say, "foreplay"?
Foreplay.</i>

21:51.827 --> 21:53.624
Yeah.
- I gotta find the foreplay.

21:53.762 --> 21:55.696
- Where is it?
- I know where. Hold on.

21:55.831 --> 21:57.731
Mom knows where the foreplay is.
Hold on.

21:57.866 --> 21:59.060
- Hold on, Sarah.
- Hold on.

21:59.201 --> 22:00.532
- Okay.
- Hello?

22:00.669 --> 22:02.603
Listen,
I know you're all riled up about this,

22:02.738 --> 22:06.265
but I've gotta get through financial reports
before Kitty's thing tonight.

22:06.408 --> 22:08.239
"Otherwise, you'll come up short. "

22:08.377 --> 22:11.346
- What?
- Sarah, go to your fax machine.

22:11.480 --> 22:14.210
"My older sister's a product
of my mother's conflicted ideals.

22:14.349 --> 22:17.045
She tries to do it all. The home,
the family, the 70-hour work week.

22:17.185 --> 22:18.914
And then she's disappointed
that she can't. "

22:19.054 --> 22:20.214
But, well, Mom, that's true.

22:20.355 --> 22:21.515
Yeah, well, you got off easy,

22:21.656 --> 22:25.592
Miss CEO-Soccer-Mom
Who's-Too-Hard-on-Herself.

22:25.727 --> 22:28.491
Meanwhile, I'm the liberal fascist,
page 72.

22:28.630 --> 22:30.427
Mom. Liberal fascist, 72.

22:30.565 --> 22:34.592
Look, I don't believe in book burning,
but this book needs to be burned.

22:34.736 --> 22:37.364
She's making me sound
like some throwback from the '50s.

22:37.506 --> 22:38.598
Listen to this.

22:38.740 --> 22:41.675
"The immovable, entrenched in his
own point of view, traditional man's man

22:41.810 --> 22:45.211
who believes he's obligated
to hold the mantle of our forefathers. "

22:45.347 --> 22:47.281
Well, you are running
our dad's company.

22:47.416 --> 22:49.407
She doesn't think
she's gonna publish this, right?

22:49.551 --> 22:52.714
I don't know,
"my brother, the retro white guy. "

22:52.854 --> 22:55.220
- This has to be libelous.
- Maybe, why don't you ask Kevin?

22:55.357 --> 22:56.847
Oh, no.

22:56.992 --> 22:59.722
That's right. Retro white guy fired him.

23:00.629 --> 23:01.891
Oh, don't even get me started.

23:02.030 --> 23:05.431
What, I'm the obsessive cynic
hiding behind identity politics?

23:05.567 --> 23:07.194
You know why I'm obsessive?

23:07.335 --> 23:09.064
I'm a gay man living in a country

23:09.204 --> 23:12.196
where I can't legally marry the guy I love
in 48 states.

23:12.340 --> 23:14.638
There's gotta be something
we can do about this, right?

23:14.776 --> 23:17.040
You're not seriously asking me
for legal advice, are you?

23:17.179 --> 23:19.010
Come on, we've been over this.

23:19.147 --> 23:20.546
- Boys.
- I say we bail on dinner.

23:20.682 --> 23:21.740
- No.
- Yeah.

23:21.883 --> 23:24.283
No,
Kitty is really relying on us to be there.

23:24.419 --> 23:27.081
It's an incredibly important night.
The least we can do is show up.

23:27.222 --> 23:28.519
We haven't read everything.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.182
Maybe it's not so bad, in context.

23:31.326 --> 23:33.760
- The context that I read, it's pretty bad.
- Yeah.

23:33.895 --> 23:36.261
Hey, is everyone ready to go?

23:37.933 --> 23:40.959
Listen, everyone,
we're going to go to this dinner tonight,

23:41.103 --> 23:44.698
we're gonna help Kitty get her baby,
and then we'll deal with this book.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.932
Okay.

23:46.074 --> 23:47.632
Great.

23:47.776 --> 23:49.539
I've got to change. Don't touch anything.

23:49.678 --> 23:51.407
Hi, honey.

23:52.414 --> 23:53.881
- Hey.
- What's going on?

24:00.689 --> 24:03.783
Are you sure
that I can't get you another drink?

24:04.092 --> 24:05.684
No, I'm good.

24:05.827 --> 24:07.419
Okay.

24:10.932 --> 24:12.297
They're here.

24:13.068 --> 24:14.763
They're here.

24:16.037 --> 24:18.301
Hi, I know, the traffic was horrible.
I'm sorry.

24:18.440 --> 24:19.805
No, it was fine. Don't worry.

24:19.941 --> 24:22.068
- If anyone messes this up, I'll kill them.
Okay.

24:22.210 --> 24:25.179
You know us cavemen.
Any reason to fly into a rage, right?

24:25.313 --> 24:26.371
Hey.
- Are you okay?

24:26.515 --> 24:29.484
I'm just really car sick.
- She was reading in the car.

24:30.152 --> 24:33.178
Hey, sorry we're late.
I can't help myself, irresponsible youth.

24:33.321 --> 24:35.915
What? Who's...?

24:37.726 --> 24:39.159
You told them about the book.

24:39.294 --> 24:41.228
They learned of your treachery
all by themselves.

24:41.363 --> 24:43.058
- Oh, Mom, please...
- Here.

24:43.198 --> 24:46.224
- Ugh!
- The chicken's in the trunk.

24:53.508 --> 24:56.306
Your entire family has read a book
that I just found out existed?

24:56.444 --> 24:58.071
Because they're nosy and out of line.

24:58.213 --> 25:00.306
When you were hiding it from me,
it was manipulative.

25:00.448 --> 25:02.143
- Now, it's irresponsible.
- Irresponsible?

25:02.284 --> 25:04.218
I just covered every outlet in this house.

25:04.352 --> 25:06.115
Well, at least we have that going for us.

25:06.254 --> 25:08.745
Sarah said that everybody
was gonna be on their best behavior.

25:08.890 --> 25:12.690
Great, so we're all in the same boat.
Mad at you and pretending we're not.

25:13.895 --> 25:15.453
Well, everybody dig in.

25:15.597 --> 25:16.689
Don't be shy.

25:16.831 --> 25:18.526
This family's been called a lot of things.

25:18.667 --> 25:20.601
"Shy" isn't one of them.

25:20.735 --> 25:22.134
I hear you're a wonderful cook.

25:22.470 --> 25:24.370
I'm the happy homemaker.

25:24.506 --> 25:27.270
I wish we had some meat and potatoes,
because I'm that kind of a guy.

25:27.409 --> 25:29.070
Stop it.

25:30.845 --> 25:32.073
Sarah, how are Paige and Coop?

25:32.214 --> 25:34.705
Oh, actually,
I swapped with Joe this week.

25:34.849 --> 25:37.409
I have been working so hard at Ojai.

25:37.552 --> 25:39.076
And still she falls short.

25:40.822 --> 25:42.551
You know, I think,

25:42.691 --> 25:45.751
before we dig into this amazing meal
that Nora has prepared for us,

25:45.894 --> 25:50.763
I just wanted to thank everybody
for beating the traffic and...

25:50.899 --> 25:52.958
Mm. Excuse me.

25:53.101 --> 25:55.899
- Coming up here
and taking time out of your busy lives.

25:57.305 --> 26:01.799
And, Carla, this is such a great opportunity
to break bread

26:01.943 --> 26:03.843
with a family that is going to be

26:05.180 --> 26:07.705
So critical to this baby's life.

26:07.849 --> 26:12.149
And I know that all of us are grateful
that you could be here tonight,

26:12.287 --> 26:14.687
so thank you.

26:18.393 --> 26:20.361
Oh, gosh. Did I get it on you?

26:20.495 --> 26:21.962
Yeah.
Oh, you're soaking wet.

26:22.097 --> 26:23.359
It's okay, it's okay.

26:23.498 --> 26:25.989
Let me go get you...
Really, I have a long drive back.

26:26.134 --> 26:28.932
- She's got a long drive back.
- I can still get her something dry.

26:29.070 --> 26:30.970
- I can still...
The woman wants to drive home.

26:31.106 --> 26:32.198
Ladies.

26:32.340 --> 26:34.365
It's okay.

26:35.744 --> 26:37.439
It's okay.

26:37.579 --> 26:41.413
I'm so sorry.
That just wasn't a typical dinner, right?

26:41.549 --> 26:43.642
I think that everybody was very nervous.

26:43.785 --> 26:45.878
Very nervous and, it...
- It's all right.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.648
This is a difficult process.

26:47.789 --> 26:50.417
- I'll be in touch.
- Oh.

26:57.999 --> 26:59.933
- You did that on purpose.
- Kitty, I don't know.

27:00.068 --> 27:02.628
I must've grabbed the cayenne pepper
instead of the paprika.

27:02.771 --> 27:05.535
I couldn't let her eat it.
Honestly, Kitty, it was a mistake.

27:05.674 --> 27:06.732
- Honestly.
Yeah.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.843
But eviscerating us in print
is not a mistake.

27:08.977 --> 27:11.411
Oh, Kevin, I didn't eviscerate anybody.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.343
I was making a point
about the electorate.

27:13.481 --> 27:16.211
- By calling me a chauvinist?
- Yeah, and me a cynical contrarian?

27:16.351 --> 27:19.878
You're taking it out of context.
The book isn't about any of you.

27:20.021 --> 27:21.955
You represent archetypes
of American voters.

27:22.090 --> 27:23.614
Did you not understand that?

27:23.758 --> 27:26.318
Or, oh, I see, I see.
Did you skim ahead to your own names?

27:26.461 --> 27:29.919
Defend yourself all you want, Kitty.
Bottom line is we're hurt too.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.896
And on top of all this Ryan situation...

27:32.067 --> 27:34.160
You know what?
I don't give a rat's ass about Ryan.

27:34.302 --> 27:36.668
Of course, you don't.
You're only thinking about yourself.

27:36.805 --> 27:38.272
That's right, thinking about myself.

27:38.406 --> 27:40.670
It was bad enough
when you were in New York on the radio,

27:40.809 --> 27:42.936
using us as fodder for your career.

27:43.311 --> 27:45.541
But at least then,
you were 3000 miles away.

27:45.680 --> 27:47.648
Now it just feels like
you're spying on us.

27:47.782 --> 27:48.874
Spying on you?

27:49.017 --> 27:51.577
You never asked our permission, Kitty.
You just used us.

27:51.720 --> 27:52.914
Mom, calm down.

27:53.054 --> 27:55.716
God, I thought we were past this.
I thought you'd changed.

27:55.857 --> 27:56.915
I hate this part of you.

27:57.058 --> 27:58.286
Nora, that's enough.

27:58.693 --> 28:00.524
The very thing
that you like least about Kitty

28:00.662 --> 28:02.459
is the thing
that I love the most about her.

28:02.597 --> 28:05.532
She is upfront, she is honest,
she is opinionated.

28:05.667 --> 28:06.929
Just like the rest of you.

28:07.068 --> 28:10.037
She invited you here because she thought
you'd make a good impression.

28:10.205 --> 28:12.002
- Oh, I see you haven't read the book.
- No.

28:12.140 --> 28:15.371
I didn't go into her bag, read something
she wasn't prepared for me to see.

28:15.543 --> 28:18.376
Robert,
I understand you're feeling protective,

28:18.513 --> 28:20.413
but this is between Kitty and us.

28:20.548 --> 28:23.142
No, tonight is about Kitty and me.
It's not about anybody else.

28:23.284 --> 28:24.478
All you needed to do

28:24.619 --> 28:26.610
was keep your opinions to yourself
for two hours.

28:26.755 --> 28:28.382
- We tried.
- You didn't try hard enough.

28:28.523 --> 28:32.323
I spend all my time dealing
with spoiled, self-centered politicians.

28:32.460 --> 28:34.485
And tonight, I feel like I never left D.C.

28:34.629 --> 28:37.223
Well, we aren't politicians, Robert.
We're human beings.

28:37.365 --> 28:41.199
We don't know how to hide our feelings
and pretend everything is hunky-dory.

28:41.336 --> 28:43.566
It's not pretending,
it's being considerate.

28:43.705 --> 28:45.036
I am considerate.

28:45.173 --> 28:47.607
I consider all my children all the time.

28:47.742 --> 28:51.234
And you don't know what it's like to feel
that you've been betrayed by one of them.

28:51.379 --> 28:52.505
No, no, I know how you feel.

28:52.647 --> 28:55.207
I know how all of you feel
because the minute you have a feeling,

28:55.350 --> 28:58.183
you start spewing with complete disregard
like a bunch of children.

28:58.319 --> 29:01.117
You're adults. Get a filter.

29:04.325 --> 29:06.418
Sorry, it's getting late.

29:18.339 --> 29:21.172
You stood up for me,
and now you're cleaning?

29:21.309 --> 29:23.368
What are you gunning for,
Husband of the Year?

29:24.479 --> 29:26.709
Kitty, I don't even know what to say.

29:28.283 --> 29:30.183
Yeah. I...

29:31.052 --> 29:33.680
I can't change my family, but...

29:35.890 --> 29:37.551
Here.

29:39.461 --> 29:43.329
You can read it if you want.

29:48.236 --> 29:51.034
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

30:07.388 --> 30:08.912
Um, do you wanna
maybe order some dinner?

30:09.057 --> 30:11.218
I mean, we really didn't get to eat much.

30:11.359 --> 30:12.724
No, I'm good.

30:14.095 --> 30:15.653
Tonight was pretty weird, huh?

30:16.097 --> 30:17.189
Yeah.

30:17.332 --> 30:19.357
Robert's usually so composed.

30:21.669 --> 30:24.866
Justin, there's something
that I've been thinking about.

30:25.874 --> 30:30.470
And it's been kind of difficult for me
to bring it up because it's sort of awkward.

30:30.612 --> 30:32.512
And it hasn't really been the right time...

30:32.647 --> 30:37.880
Okay, Rebecca, I'm sorry,
but I can't have sex with you.

30:39.187 --> 30:42.748
- Wait. What?
- No, I want to, I really want to. Just...

30:43.791 --> 30:45.816
- Not now.
- No, I don't wanna have sex either.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.518
I mean, not now.

30:48.062 --> 30:50.963
So you brought me to the motel,
and you weren't thinking about having?

30:51.099 --> 30:52.498
No. I mean, I have.

30:52.634 --> 30:55.626
But, Justin, I've been distracted.

30:56.437 --> 30:58.530
My mother gave me $2 million.

30:59.607 --> 31:01.973
- What?
- Yeah.

31:02.310 --> 31:03.902
And...

31:05.113 --> 31:06.910
I don't really know what to do about it.

31:07.048 --> 31:10.484
Two million dollars? Like, $2 million?

31:10.618 --> 31:13.519
Yeah, and, Justin,
I wanted to talk to you about it, but I...

31:13.655 --> 31:15.987
It's your father's money,
and you have issues with him.

31:16.124 --> 31:17.421
No, Rebecca, I mean, you can...

31:17.559 --> 31:20.460
- No, of course, you can talk to me.
- And I know why she's doing it too.

31:20.595 --> 31:22.460
I mean,
she obviously wants to buy me back.

31:22.597 --> 31:25.964
This woman invested 20 years of her life
being a mistress for this money.

31:26.100 --> 31:27.829
I mean, it's dirty money.

31:27.969 --> 31:30.335
I mean, if I take this money,
I am just as bad as her.

31:31.673 --> 31:33.265
Wow.

31:33.741 --> 31:35.333
Yeah.

31:36.411 --> 31:38.606
And, Justin, it's...

31:39.280 --> 31:42.841
It's not that I don't think
about sex with you.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.679
I do. A lot.

31:44.819 --> 31:46.150
- Okay.
- I just...

31:46.287 --> 31:49.188
I've made a lot of bad choices
in my life.

31:49.958 --> 31:51.016
Me too.

31:51.492 --> 31:53.460
And I think a part of me
was just really relieved

31:53.595 --> 31:59.090
that you didn't push it because
I want it to be different with you.

31:59.767 --> 32:01.758
I want it to be about us.

32:03.438 --> 32:04.928
Does that sound lame?

32:05.073 --> 32:06.631
No.

32:07.709 --> 32:09.199
No.

32:14.182 --> 32:15.547
So we wait.

32:16.651 --> 32:18.175
We wait.

32:22.657 --> 32:23.954
You wanted to see me?

32:24.092 --> 32:25.457
I'm glad you could make it.

32:25.593 --> 32:27.254
I didn't realize I was punching a clock.

32:27.395 --> 32:29.590
Sarah,
I was here at 6 a. m. This morning

32:29.731 --> 32:32.632
and I have been here every single night
until 11:00.

32:32.767 --> 32:35.031
That's because you don't have a life.

32:35.169 --> 32:37.034
And FYI, I've been here too.

32:37.171 --> 32:38.798
So if you'd please tell me
what you want,

32:38.940 --> 32:41.431
I've gotta finish the other 17 things
you put on my desk.

32:41.576 --> 32:44.636
We have all been busting our asses
to try to save this company

32:44.779 --> 32:46.337
out from under the mess you made.

32:46.481 --> 32:47.971
Oh, come on. I'm just an easy target.

32:48.116 --> 32:49.413
Your daughter won't talk to you.

32:49.550 --> 32:51.279
My mother just told you
about Ryan Lafferty.

32:51.419 --> 32:53.649
It's clear you're taking
your self-loathing out on me.

32:53.788 --> 32:56.848
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

32:59.127 --> 33:01.721
Now, I need the numbers
for this quarterly inventory report

33:01.863 --> 33:05.355
on my desk by 2:00 this afternoon.

33:19.113 --> 33:20.205
Kitty, hi.

33:20.348 --> 33:22.646
I wasn't expecting you.

33:22.784 --> 33:25.844
Well, I just wanted to return these.

33:26.854 --> 33:28.378
Thanks.

33:28.523 --> 33:32.084
- You didn't have to.
- No, I know, but I just...

33:32.226 --> 33:34.421
I was just writing a letter
to your social worker.

33:34.562 --> 33:38.931
I was apologizing
for dumping water all over her.

33:39.067 --> 33:40.625
You know what? It doesn't even matter.

33:41.502 --> 33:44.630
Robert and I have our own strikes
against us anyway.

33:44.772 --> 33:46.000
I mean, he's bi-coastal

33:46.140 --> 33:48.472
and we've only been married
for under a year and...

33:48.609 --> 33:50.600
Surely they won't hold that against you.

33:50.745 --> 33:51.837
No, well, yeah.

33:51.979 --> 33:54.004
People assume
that just because we are who we are,

33:54.148 --> 33:55.206
that we can get a baby.

33:55.349 --> 33:57.715
But it just doesn't work that way.
It doesn't feel that way.

33:57.852 --> 34:00.286
It feels
like we even have to be more careful

34:00.421 --> 34:02.981
because everything we do
is public knowledge.

34:03.124 --> 34:05.649
And you know what?
It doesn't even matter.

34:05.793 --> 34:09.126
It's in the hands of fate.

34:09.263 --> 34:13.222
I know this is hard for you
but you're going to get your baby.

34:13.367 --> 34:18.634
And I'm so sorry I let you down
and I didn't come through for you.

34:19.841 --> 34:24.402
When I got home last night,
I took out my short stories.

34:24.545 --> 34:27.411
You mean,
the ones that you wrote for that class?

34:27.547 --> 34:29.777
They're the only things I've done
in a very long time

34:29.917 --> 34:32.351
that aren't all about you kids.

34:33.054 --> 34:37.353
I need to feel that there's more to me.

34:37.492 --> 34:42.953
That I'm talented and important.

34:43.097 --> 34:45.793
Mom, you're the most important person
in this family.

34:45.933 --> 34:49.527
No, your dad was the one you respected
and admired.

34:49.670 --> 34:53.766
I was just the one that drove you
back and forth to ballet class.

34:53.908 --> 34:56.103
And then you started
the adoption process.

34:56.244 --> 35:02.615
And you wanted my advice
and my help and my chicken paprika.

35:02.750 --> 35:03.910
And then you read the book.

35:04.051 --> 35:06.042
It wasn't the words, let's face it.

35:06.187 --> 35:08.382
You've called me worse.

35:09.323 --> 35:13.350
I guess I had just started to believe
that you valued me

35:13.494 --> 35:14.654
and you looked up to me.

35:14.796 --> 35:16.627
And then I read your description of me.

35:16.764 --> 35:21.030
And it felt like you still just saw me

35:21.169 --> 35:24.730
as the person who made your lunches.

35:24.872 --> 35:26.567
Oh, Mom. Mom, no.

35:26.707 --> 35:29.676
Maybe I thought that
when I was 10 or 15, but...

35:30.678 --> 35:32.145
You know what?

35:32.280 --> 35:38.116
I brought you this
because I do value your opinion.

35:38.553 --> 35:44.287
And, also, I don't think that you read
the first page when you read it before.

35:52.200 --> 35:56.193
"This book is dedicated to Nora Walker,
my mother.

35:56.337 --> 36:00.103
Who taught me how to fight
and how to stand up for who I am.

36:00.241 --> 36:03.233
Without her,
this book wouldn't be possible. "

36:12.186 --> 36:14.848
You're right.
It doesn't seem so bad in context.

36:24.165 --> 36:25.530
Hey.

36:25.666 --> 36:27.031
- You snore, you know.
- I don't.

36:27.168 --> 36:28.692
Yeah, you do.
You know, like, little, like:

36:30.037 --> 36:32.267
- Little snore noises.
- Shut up.

36:33.107 --> 36:34.438
How'd you sleep? Okay?

36:34.575 --> 36:39.410
It was the best first time
"sleeping" together ever.

36:39.547 --> 36:42.277
It was my first time
sleeping with a millionaire.

36:43.684 --> 36:46.209
Well, don't get used to it.
It's not gonna last.

36:46.354 --> 36:48.754
Okay, suddenly, you're not half as sexy.

36:48.890 --> 36:51.791
Shut up.
You weren't getting any anyway.

36:51.926 --> 36:55.453
- So you wanna go surfing?
- I don't know.

36:55.596 --> 36:57.894
I feel like you should get back
and talk to your mom.

36:58.032 --> 36:59.829
Okay.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.832
What about breakfast? I'm starving.

37:02.803 --> 37:05.294
Breakfast. Done.

37:13.180 --> 37:15.375
Not the book again.

37:16.017 --> 37:17.814
- I'm almost halfway through.
- Hey.

37:18.352 --> 37:19.410
You know what?

37:19.553 --> 37:21.384
- It's so good.
- Really?

37:21.522 --> 37:23.990
Really, she doesn't paint us
quite as bad as I thought.

37:24.125 --> 37:26.992
More importantly, it's such
an interesting perspective on politics.

37:27.128 --> 37:28.925
I'm so proud of her.

37:29.063 --> 37:31.623
Of course, I don't agree with half of it.

37:32.099 --> 37:35.000
You didn't come here to talk about this.

37:35.336 --> 37:37.463
No, no.

37:40.942 --> 37:42.842
I need to give you this.

37:42.977 --> 37:44.945
All right.

37:47.181 --> 37:50.241
Rebecca, this is your trust.

37:50.384 --> 37:54.286
Your quite substantial trust
as I remember.

37:54.422 --> 37:56.822
- What are you doing?
- It doesn't belong to me anymore.

37:56.958 --> 38:01.861
And I want you and your family to have it,
so I'm gonna put it in your name.

38:02.396 --> 38:04.660
Or you could give it to Ryan.
I don't know.

38:05.066 --> 38:06.966
Well, that implies
I'm never gonna meet him.

38:07.301 --> 38:09.030
You're not?

38:09.804 --> 38:12.602
You know, Rebecca,
Kitty does mention you in the book.

38:12.740 --> 38:15.834
It's this really small passage
I think we all overlooked

38:15.977 --> 38:19.276
because we were so busy skimming
for our own names.

38:19.413 --> 38:22.849
She calls you "collateral damage. "

38:23.184 --> 38:24.242
And I think it's true.

38:24.385 --> 38:28.879
I think you've suffered more than anyone
for this family's missteps.

38:29.023 --> 38:31.218
This Ryan person,

38:31.359 --> 38:33.224
why should he go through
what you went through?

38:33.361 --> 38:37.422
Why should he be collateral damage?
He shouldn't and he's not going to be.

38:37.865 --> 38:39.423
About this trust,

38:39.567 --> 38:42.536
I'll hold it for you
in case you change your mind.

38:43.170 --> 38:44.831
I won't.

38:45.506 --> 38:48.168
Well, I'll hold it for you for a rainy day.

38:57.752 --> 39:00.516
Now, I know that you're still mad at me.

39:00.654 --> 39:03.589
But I just got off the phone
with Carla Hansen, and...

39:04.792 --> 39:06.623
We passed.

39:06.761 --> 39:07.819
Oh, thank God.

39:07.962 --> 39:11.022
I mean, that's if
you still wanna raise a child with me.

39:11.165 --> 39:12.325
With you, yeah.

39:12.466 --> 39:14.730
With your family, you know,
I may need a couple of weeks.

39:14.869 --> 39:16.496
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

39:16.637 --> 39:21.870
I'm sorry about my family,
and the book, and the chicken...

39:22.009 --> 39:23.943
You don't have to apologize
about your family.

39:24.078 --> 39:26.012
I mean, at least they show up.

39:26.147 --> 39:28.206
You know,
it's more than I can say for most people.

39:29.683 --> 39:32.447
So do I need to apologize for the book?

39:32.853 --> 39:34.218
For not telling me about it, yeah.

39:34.355 --> 39:37.119
Okay. I'm sorry for not telling you
about the book.

39:37.258 --> 39:40.455
And I'm sorry
for the way that I finally told you,

39:40.594 --> 39:43.324
when I told you.

39:44.331 --> 39:47.061
- So you read it?
- Twice.

39:47.201 --> 39:49.726
Twice? Really? Hm.

39:53.441 --> 39:57.036
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Okay, so this
is my punishment? The silent treatment.

39:57.178 --> 39:59.840
- Maybe.
- Well, it's cruel.

39:59.980 --> 40:02.380
I don't know what to say.

40:02.516 --> 40:05.144
I mean, I knew you could write,
but this is so smart.

40:06.053 --> 40:07.111
It's so human

40:07.254 --> 40:09.745
and incredibly relevant
in a post-partisan debate.

40:10.191 --> 40:11.317
Oh, my God.

40:13.861 --> 40:15.089
I'm so proud of you.

40:15.229 --> 40:17.857
Oh, really, really? Oh, my God.

40:17.998 --> 40:19.659
- There's one thing.
- What?

40:20.434 --> 40:22.925
You know, if you publish this,
you're gonna have to resign.

40:23.070 --> 40:24.332
Well, what do you mean?

40:24.472 --> 40:27.032
I can't have people on my staff
writing books.

40:27.174 --> 40:29.142
But it's completely up to you.

40:30.177 --> 40:33.010
- Well, I'm glad you called.
- Well, it was long overdue.

40:33.147 --> 40:36.810
And thanks
for expediting our distribution license.

40:36.951 --> 40:40.318
- It's my job.
- Well, you do it very well.

40:40.454 --> 40:41.944
Thank you.

40:44.091 --> 40:47.618
Hey, look, if there's anything else,
you know, that I can do?

40:48.295 --> 40:50.354
- Do you mean that?
- Of course.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.224
Well, I have a daughter

40:54.368 --> 40:56.563
who's been going through
this really rough time.

40:56.704 --> 40:57.762
Mental health issues.

40:57.905 --> 41:02.808
And I was trying to find
this old friend of hers.

41:04.011 --> 41:07.879
You have access to public records,
don't you?

41:08.015 --> 41:09.482
State records, yes.

41:09.617 --> 41:14.350
I was hoping that if she could reconnect
with this friend it might help.

41:14.889 --> 41:16.948
Not a problem.

41:17.625 --> 41:20.822
- All I need is a name.
- Oh, great.

41:20.961 --> 41:25.523
I can't tell you what a huge favor this is.

41:26.066 --> 41:28.830
His name is Ryan.

41:29.436 --> 41:31.836
Ryan Lafferty.
