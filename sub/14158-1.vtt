WEBVTT

00:21.000 --> 00:23.734
( waves crashing )

00:39.767 --> 00:42.534
( reggae music playing )

00:44.767 --> 00:47.834
* Slow Wind for me girl...

00:47.934 --> 00:49.900
( man speaking Tongan )

00:50.000 --> 00:53.300
* Take your time
on me girl... *

00:53.400 --> 00:56.167
( continues
speaking Tongan )

00:56.267 --> 00:58.100
Everything was
happy and...

00:58.200 --> 01:00.034
it was
a peaceful place here

01:00.134 --> 01:01.200
until Jonah came along.

01:01.300 --> 01:03.600
( speaking Tongan )

01:07.300 --> 01:09.167
Jonah is like
a fucking idiot.

01:09.267 --> 01:10.667
Kapula! Wait up!

01:10.767 --> 01:13.200
Aisi:
He uses swear languages
most of the time.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.167
I told you to wait,
you fucking pussy!

01:15.267 --> 01:17.300
Aisi:
He's very annoying.
No one likes him here.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.434
I told you to fucking wait,
you dickhead.

01:19.534 --> 01:22.300
Jonah:
The whole island's boring.
There's nothing to do.

01:22.400 --> 01:26.134
Tonga is shit.
And my uncle, he's a homo.

01:26.234 --> 01:28.534
( speaks Tongan )

01:29.934 --> 01:32.534
( laughs )
He is a very bully...

01:32.634 --> 01:34.234
person.
Come over!

01:34.334 --> 01:36.567
Aisi: He hits little kids
every time they play.

01:36.667 --> 01:38.900
( screaming )
More coconuts!
Give me coconuts!

01:39.000 --> 01:43.400
Aisi: He cannot
leave them alone.
Get the little girls!

01:43.500 --> 01:45.967
Come closer!
I won't do anything,
I promise!

01:46.067 --> 01:48.434
( girls scream )
Aisi: Most of the time,

01:48.534 --> 01:50.367
he's very disrespectful
of his aunties.

01:50.467 --> 01:52.167
Hey!
It's not my dick!

01:52.267 --> 01:54.067
Get out! ( shouts )
It's a bottle. It's a bottle.

01:54.167 --> 01:55.934
*

01:56.034 --> 01:58.467
Aisi: He's very mean
to my son Komaki.

01:58.567 --> 02:00.600
He's always
picking on him.

02:00.700 --> 02:03.467
( boys laugh )

02:03.567 --> 02:06.667
Komaki has so many places
in his body to be beaten,

02:06.767 --> 02:09.100
but he only chooses
to hit his balls.

02:09.200 --> 02:12.067
( yells )
Bastard!

02:12.167 --> 02:14.367
( speaks Tongan )

02:16.967 --> 02:20.734
Aisi:
He writes his graffitis
around the house,

02:20.834 --> 02:22.167
and it's dirty.

02:22.267 --> 02:25.500
( Mamafu speaks Tongan )

02:25.600 --> 02:27.434
Aisi:
It just pisses
all of us off.

02:27.534 --> 02:29.167
( shouts )
( screams )
( kids laugh )

02:29.267 --> 02:30.667
Sucked in, Aunty!

02:30.767 --> 02:33.167
Aisi:
A few weeks ago,
it came to me

02:33.267 --> 02:35.334
that I really wanted
to kill him

02:35.434 --> 02:38.267
because of what
he did to my car.

02:38.367 --> 02:39.700
Jonah:
These are my cousins.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.267
I don't speak Tongan.

02:41.367 --> 02:43.234
I can't understand
half the shit they're saying.

02:43.334 --> 02:46.167
And I know
a few rude words, like...

02:46.267 --> 02:47.434
kai kak tenga.

02:47.534 --> 02:48.900
That means
something really rude,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.700
kai kak tenga.
( Komaki speaks )

02:51.800 --> 02:53.567
I know I said that.

02:53.667 --> 02:56.134
Komaki:
Jonah always tells lies.
Jonah: No, I don't.

02:56.234 --> 02:57.600
Hey, boys, in Australia

02:57.700 --> 03:00.100
once I beat the shit
out of a kangaroo

03:00.200 --> 03:01.534
'cause it bit me
on the dick.

03:01.634 --> 03:03.967
In Australia,
every boy gets a free Ferrari

03:04.067 --> 03:06.234
when they turn 16
from the government.

03:06.334 --> 03:08.767
In Australia once
I released a single

03:08.867 --> 03:10.867
and I won
a Grammy award for it.

03:10.967 --> 03:12.934
A few weeks ago
I turned 14

03:13.034 --> 03:15.200
and I got my official
Takalua tattoo.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.600
This is what you get
when you're an older boy

03:17.700 --> 03:19.334
and your dad decides
that you're brave enough

03:19.434 --> 03:21.067
and you are man enough.

03:21.167 --> 03:22.967
Boys--
older boys show.

03:23.067 --> 03:24.567
All Takaluas get 'em,

03:24.667 --> 03:27.200
and the good thing is
it protects you.

03:27.300 --> 03:29.500
So you know, if-- if--

03:29.600 --> 03:32.300
if I went swimming
and a big shark came up,

03:32.400 --> 03:34.234
I could punch
the shark in the head

03:34.334 --> 03:37.167
and the shark would die.
It would just disintegrate.

03:37.267 --> 03:38.800
This is
the Takalua link.

03:38.900 --> 03:40.200
Only Takalua boys
can do it.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.034
We link arms,
go like this,

03:42.134 --> 03:43.734
and if you're strong
and you go like this,

03:43.834 --> 03:46.534
pull hard--
nothing breaks
the Takalua link.

03:46.634 --> 03:48.900
Pull as hard
as you can apart, boys.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.934
See? Nothing breaks
the Takalua link.

03:51.034 --> 03:53.000
( boys laugh )
This is the boys' bedroom.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.167
Boys, show 'em
where we sleep.

03:54.267 --> 03:56.034
This is where I sleep.

03:56.134 --> 03:58.700
And this is Feke, my cousin.
He sleep here, too.

03:58.800 --> 04:02.200
See this?
This is my brother back
in Sydney, Moses.

04:02.300 --> 04:04.400
Moses, he's my favorite
family person ever,

04:04.500 --> 04:06.100
and he's
a really good singer.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.600
He's like the best singer
in the world.

04:07.700 --> 04:10.134
And one day I'm gonna
take him to America

04:10.234 --> 04:13.534
to get a record deal,
and I'm gonna be his manager.

04:13.634 --> 04:15.234
Boys, let's all pretend
we're asleep.

04:15.334 --> 04:17.000
Show 'em how we sleep.

04:17.100 --> 04:19.700
( mimicking snoring )

04:19.800 --> 04:21.967
*
( van honks )

04:22.067 --> 04:25.334
Dad! Dad!

04:25.434 --> 04:28.367
Give me a hug.
You're being a little
dickhead, aren't you?

04:28.467 --> 04:30.967
Jonah:
Today my dad
and my Aunty Grace

04:31.067 --> 04:33.167
came to visit me
from Australia

04:33.267 --> 04:34.900
to check on my behavior.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.334
Look at this, Aunty!

04:36.434 --> 04:38.334
Wow! Beautiful.
New tattoo.

04:38.434 --> 04:40.267
Hey, I've got
a surprise for you.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.467
Oh, Moses!
What are you doing here?

04:42.567 --> 04:44.134
Jonah:
And the best thing is,

04:44.234 --> 04:46.100
they brought
my brother Moses here.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.334
You've grown,
motherfucker!

04:47.434 --> 04:49.067
Yeah, you look
big as motherfucker.

04:49.167 --> 04:51.667
Shit. Fuck!
This is everyone!

04:51.767 --> 04:52.967
I can't believe
you're here!

04:53.067 --> 04:54.367
Jonah:
It was the best surprise ever.

04:54.467 --> 04:57.034
( reggae music playing )
Ooh yeah.

04:57.134 --> 04:59.134
Yeah. Yeah.

04:59.234 --> 05:01.667
( speaking Tongan )

05:01.767 --> 05:04.034
Hey, Moses, let's do
the Takalua link.
Oi.

05:04.134 --> 05:06.434
( speaking Tongan )

05:10.034 --> 05:11.267
Hey, Dad.
Dad, link me.

05:11.367 --> 05:13.100
Link onto me.
Fuck off.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.334
Okay. I don't even wanna
do it with you, anyway.

05:15.434 --> 05:18.034
*
Grace: I miss Jonah
very very much

05:18.134 --> 05:21.300
and he can't
stay here any more.

05:21.400 --> 05:25.100
But I wanna take him home
because I love him.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.434
* And I need her...

05:27.534 --> 05:29.367
Yeah, Moses!

05:29.467 --> 05:31.067
The best singer
in the world!

05:31.167 --> 05:33.200
Grace:
He need to come home
to Australia

05:33.300 --> 05:36.434
and he is pissing off
his uncle way too much.

05:36.534 --> 05:39.767
( people singing,
chattering )

05:41.300 --> 05:43.134
Grace:
He needs discipline.

05:43.234 --> 05:45.434
We need to
very strict on him.

05:45.534 --> 05:47.600
We need to put him
in a school

05:47.700 --> 05:50.400
where they won't put up
with his naughtiness.

05:50.500 --> 05:51.634
( groans )

05:51.734 --> 05:53.967
Grace:
The having
of church and God

05:54.067 --> 05:55.900
will help him
to grow up to be

05:56.000 --> 05:57.234
a strong and good man.

05:57.334 --> 06:00.700
See you, Tonga!
Love you, Uncle!

06:00.800 --> 06:02.067
( shouts in Tongan )

06:02.167 --> 06:03.867
He said,
"Get fucked!"

06:03.967 --> 06:06.534
Jonah:
Going back to Australia,
it's gonna be mean as.

06:06.634 --> 06:09.567
I'm gonna be good.
I'm gonna get a good education.

06:09.667 --> 06:11.300
I'm gonna get into uni

06:11.400 --> 06:14.367
and make my family proud.
( singing continues )

06:14.467 --> 06:16.234
Jonah:
I can be a good boy
if I wanna be.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.700
( singing stops )

06:18.800 --> 06:20.767
( theme music playing )

06:34.234 --> 06:37.567
( clicking, thuds )

06:37.667 --> 06:39.800
( monkey chatters )

06:44.934 --> 06:47.600
( people singing
in foreign language )

06:47.700 --> 06:49.800
*

06:56.567 --> 06:59.967
* Yo, I'm trying not
to wear 3X's no more *

07:00.067 --> 07:02.800
* It's okay,
Kardinal stands 6'4" *

07:02.900 --> 07:05.400
* You can hear the insecurity
in my voice, right? *

07:05.500 --> 07:07.267
* I don't take
my chain off on the mic *

07:07.367 --> 07:09.634
* It's my security piece,
it gives me security... *

07:09.734 --> 07:11.200
( boys shouting )
Hey, Jonah,
is that your brother?

07:11.300 --> 07:12.734
Is that
your brother, dude?

07:12.834 --> 07:14.267
Fuck.
Let's go, let's go.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.334
Get away
from my brother!
Oh shit!

07:16.434 --> 07:17.867
Get the-- fuck you,
you fucking homo.

07:17.967 --> 07:19.834
( shouting )
Put him in the locker!

07:19.934 --> 07:21.167
Get in there,
you fucking homo.

07:21.267 --> 07:22.234
Get in, get in.
Get in there!

07:22.334 --> 07:23.600
Get in the locker!
Shove him in!

07:23.700 --> 07:26.800
Close it. Close it.
Close it with the lock.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.534
( boy yelling )

07:28.634 --> 07:31.300
( banging )
Jonah:
Fucking ranga.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.834
Let's go
over there, boys.

07:37.567 --> 07:39.834
( hip-hop music playing )
Yeah. Yeah!

07:39.934 --> 07:41.234
Yeah!
Yeah.

07:41.334 --> 07:43.734
( boys chatter )

07:43.834 --> 07:45.867
Jonah!
Yeah! Whoa!

07:45.967 --> 07:47.100
Jonah, go!

07:47.200 --> 07:48.934
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!

07:49.034 --> 07:51.567
Yeah.
Good one, Jonah.

07:52.367 --> 07:55.167
Yeah.
Yeah. Whoa.

07:55.267 --> 07:57.367
( boys chattering )

07:57.467 --> 07:59.000
Go on the floor.
Go on the floor.

07:59.100 --> 08:02.600
Jonah. Jonah!

08:02.700 --> 08:05.734
You're in deep shit.
Graydon wants to kick your ass.

08:05.834 --> 08:07.600
Piss off, fatty.

08:07.700 --> 08:09.867
Did you put Graydon's
little brother in the locker
and lock the door?

08:09.967 --> 08:11.667
No.
Well, everyone
saw you do it.

08:11.767 --> 08:13.867
Look out, look out.
Well, he was bullying Moses.

08:13.967 --> 08:16.334
He's a homo.
Well, Graydon's pissed
and he's looking for you,

08:16.434 --> 08:18.167
so I'd hide if I were you.
I don't even care.

08:18.267 --> 08:20.867
Tell him
to go marry his dick.
He's in Year 12, Jonah,

08:20.967 --> 08:22.567
and he's stronger
and bigger than you.
He's school captain

08:22.667 --> 08:24.900
so I'd watch out
if I were you.
I don't care.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.367
Get out of our area.
Go away, fatty!

08:27.467 --> 08:30.300
Don't wanna talk to you!
It's the Year 9 area.
Okay, all right.

08:30.400 --> 08:31.934
By the way,
I'm telling Dad tonight.

08:32.034 --> 08:34.034
Enjoy your hiding.
Enjoy my dick.

08:34.134 --> 08:36.867
( boys chattering )

08:36.967 --> 08:39.300
Boy: Who cares?
Boy #2: We'll go grab
a feed from the canteen.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.534
Boy #3:
Yeah, the canteen.

08:41.634 --> 08:43.634
Oi! Oi, dickhead!

08:43.734 --> 08:46.034
Did you put
my little brother
in a locker?

08:46.134 --> 08:49.367
No.
You're lying!
He just told me you did.

08:49.467 --> 08:51.967
Why'd you believe him?
Graydon:
Well, it's fucking dangerous.

08:52.067 --> 08:54.700
I'm telling teachers, man.
Well, he was
bullying my brother!

08:54.800 --> 08:56.867
I don't care.
Go away, ranga.

08:56.967 --> 08:59.634
You just call me
a ranga, mate?
Yeah, 'cause you are one.

08:59.734 --> 09:02.000
This one's gonna be good.
Listen, we're in Year 12,

09:02.100 --> 09:03.867
so I don't need to put up
with your Year 9 shit.

09:03.967 --> 09:06.134
I don't care.
Don't fuck
with my little brother.

09:06.234 --> 09:07.800
Don't fuck
with my face.

09:09.267 --> 09:11.600
Apologize for what you did.
Apologize to my dick.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.334
That doesn't make sense,
so I'm not gonna do it.

09:13.434 --> 09:15.034
Your hair
doesn't make sense.

09:15.134 --> 09:16.567
Get out
of my fucking area!

09:16.667 --> 09:18.700
Do you wanna
fucking go about this?
Yeah, I do!

09:18.800 --> 09:20.100
Do you seriously wanna
fight about this, cunts?
All of you,

09:20.200 --> 09:22.200
Year 9 area!
Get out, rangas!

09:22.300 --> 09:23.700
Fucking--
Fuck you.
( boys muttering )

09:23.800 --> 09:25.400
Oi! That's enough!

09:25.500 --> 09:28.834
( boys grunt )
Break it up!

09:28.934 --> 09:30.967
You and your ranga mate--
His little brother
was being a bully!

09:31.067 --> 09:32.867
Moses: Yeah.

09:32.967 --> 09:34.867
You and your ranga mates
just piss off.
I'm Year 12. I go where I want.

09:34.967 --> 09:37.634
Off you go.
And think about it.
Jonah: Get off! Get off, rangas!

09:37.734 --> 09:40.467
Get off
the fucking bricks!
That's enough!

09:40.567 --> 09:42.267
Get up on the grass!
That's enough!

09:42.367 --> 09:44.067
Go on, out of it!
Yeah, get out!

09:44.167 --> 09:45.967
I'll tell you later,
Sir, what he did to
my little brother.

09:46.067 --> 09:48.467
I don't care! Just off you go!
Go back
to the ranga area!

09:48.567 --> 09:50.134
Piss off, Graydon.
Goodbye.
This is our area!

09:50.234 --> 09:51.934
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

09:52.034 --> 09:53.434
Come here, you,
you fucking idiot.

09:53.534 --> 09:55.234
Fuck, Sir! Ow! Ow!
Are you gonna be

09:55.334 --> 09:57.367
a fucking dipstick
all your life?
I love you, Sir.

09:57.467 --> 09:59.367
Seriously, are you?
Sir, I love you.

09:59.467 --> 10:02.034
You're a good teacher.
Listen, you lot,

10:02.134 --> 10:04.567
I swear to God I am going
to beat the living shit

10:04.667 --> 10:06.267
out of every
fucking last one of ya

10:06.367 --> 10:08.367
if this continues
every morning.

10:08.467 --> 10:11.534
Now that's five minutes out
of my coffee and smoke time

10:11.634 --> 10:14.667
that you owe me,
all right?
Boys: Sorry, Sir.

10:14.767 --> 10:17.367
Sorry, Mr. Joseph.
Love you, Sir!
I should think so.

10:17.467 --> 10:19.700
Yes, Sir.
You're a legend, Sir!
Best teacher ever!

10:19.800 --> 10:21.834
Joseph:
Holy Cross,
a Catholic high school,

10:21.934 --> 10:24.500
Low socioeconomic families.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.467
A lot of migrants,
first gen.

10:26.567 --> 10:29.267
Me personally, got out
of the army, got me Dip Ed.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.700
Just became interested
in teaching

10:32.800 --> 10:35.234
behavioral-problem teens
and learning-difficulty kids.

10:35.334 --> 10:37.534
Yeah, I set up
my behavioral unit

10:37.634 --> 10:39.900
in Lazarus House
about nine years ago.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
Spazarus House
they call it around
the school. Spaz House.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.267
It's not really fair
on the kids that go here,

10:45.367 --> 10:46.867
but it's not
entirely untrue.

10:46.967 --> 10:48.334
Sir, is this
out of a rocket?

10:48.434 --> 10:50.067
Joseph:
We're vocational based.

10:50.167 --> 10:51.934
We've got an emphasis
on trade training.

10:52.034 --> 10:55.634
And this is
the insides of the pussy.
This is the dick.

10:55.734 --> 10:57.667
Joseph:
We try and get
the kids to a level

10:57.767 --> 10:59.834
whereby they can potentially
get an apprenticeship.

10:59.934 --> 11:01.267
We're both doing it.

11:01.367 --> 11:03.034
All right, then hurry up.
It's a group assignment.

11:03.134 --> 11:04.634
Joseph:
Mostly I think we just
keep the little pricks

11:04.734 --> 11:06.434
out of trouble
and keep 'em in school.

11:06.534 --> 11:09.134
What are
you doing there, Jonah?
Building an igloo.

11:09.234 --> 11:11.300
Oh, fucking good.
Shit!

11:11.400 --> 11:13.200
What's gonna
happen there, dickhead?
Move that along.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.334
Move this brick along.
It's got a window.

11:15.434 --> 11:18.067
Sir, do you put
your dick in those bricks
when we're not here?

11:18.167 --> 11:20.334
Oh, you're disgusting!
Yeah, you do.

11:20.434 --> 11:22.367
Okay, boys, do you know
what this is called?

11:22.467 --> 11:24.667
Toilet.
Sir, my shit wouldn't
fit in this pipe.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.834
Joseph:
We've got a fair few
Pacific Islanders.

11:26.934 --> 11:29.867
They're tricky kids.
They're pretty hard
to control.

11:29.967 --> 11:31.800
( chattering )
Shut up!

11:31.900 --> 11:34.534
Joseph:
Well, I don't shy away
from a bit of physical--

11:34.634 --> 11:37.500
well, "violence" isn't
exactly the word for it--

11:37.600 --> 11:38.600
persuasiveness.

11:38.700 --> 11:41.634
Shut the fuck up!
( chattering stops )

11:42.734 --> 11:44.000
That's better!

11:44.100 --> 11:45.367
Joseph:
I think it's good for them

11:45.467 --> 11:46.934
to get a bit physical
in the classroom

11:47.034 --> 11:48.300
It shows them
that they're not as,

11:48.400 --> 11:50.634
you know, strong
as a fully-grown man.

11:50.734 --> 11:53.067
You hit--
You're too
fucking slow, mate.

11:53.167 --> 11:55.434
Fuck off, Sir!
He's too fucking slow,
this one.

11:55.534 --> 11:57.400
Fuck off!
What's going on over here?

11:57.500 --> 11:58.867
Give me the book!
I don't care!
It's mine!

11:58.967 --> 12:00.734
Were you writing
shit about me?
Joseph:
Manu! Jonah!

12:00.834 --> 12:03.434
Punching wall, go!
Come on, hit it!
( grunts )

12:03.534 --> 12:06.067
Joseph:
I've got a couple
of regular exercises

12:06.167 --> 12:07.700
I use to get the kids
to let off steam.

12:07.800 --> 12:08.934
Go!
( boys laugh )

12:09.034 --> 12:10.467
Come on,
punch the things!

12:10.567 --> 12:12.467
What sort
of a hit's that?

12:13.867 --> 12:16.000
Come on now!
Punch is that?

12:16.100 --> 12:18.300
Hit it! Hit it.
Hit it. Hit it.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.434
( sniffs )
Sir, you stink.

12:20.534 --> 12:22.834
Your armpits stink.
I can smell it from here.

12:22.934 --> 12:24.100
Joseph:
Jonah Takalua--

12:24.200 --> 12:25.734
absolute dropkick.
( hissing )

12:25.834 --> 12:27.834
Probably the most
fucked up kid I've ever taught

12:27.934 --> 12:29.334
in my entire teaching career.

12:29.434 --> 12:30.867
Shut up, idiot.
Fuck off, Sir.

12:30.967 --> 12:33.000
Stop getting off
on hitting me.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.634
Joseph:
He's virtually illiterate.

12:34.734 --> 12:36.667
Sir, what's a "head-achy"?

12:36.767 --> 12:39.467
"Headache," idiot.
Sir, how do
you spell "pussy"?

12:39.567 --> 12:41.334
Are a hundred and a thousand
the same number?

12:41.434 --> 12:42.800
Sir, who's the king
of Australia?

12:42.900 --> 12:44.834
Has a horse
ever been in space?

12:44.934 --> 12:47.067
Sir, what's a "met-chanic"?
If you chop your dick off,
does it grow back?

12:47.167 --> 12:49.367
Can you survive
from eating your own shit?

12:49.467 --> 12:50.900
I'm asking you
a question, Sir.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.800
You're the teacher.
Teach us stuff.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.834
Joseph:
He's disrespectful
of my authority.

12:54.934 --> 12:57.234
Sir, when the bell goes,
I'm just gonna walk out.

12:57.334 --> 12:59.634
I don't care what you say.
I don't give a fuck.

12:59.734 --> 13:02.334
I told you there's
no fucking swearing in class.

13:02.434 --> 13:04.467
Well, you just swore then!
Sir, you just said,

13:04.567 --> 13:07.534
"No fucking swearing,"
so bust yourself.

13:07.634 --> 13:10.300
I can swear
because I'm the adult here,

13:10.400 --> 13:13.167
and I'll fucking swear
if I choose to swear.

13:13.267 --> 13:16.200
Go and marry my dick, Sir.
Just get on with it!

13:16.300 --> 13:18.834
Stop swearing
or we'll report you
to the principal, Sir.

13:18.934 --> 13:22.300
We'll get a better teacher,
a hot female teacher.
Yeah.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.500
True.
Not an ugly man
like you, Sir.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.600
Joseph:
He's 14, thinks he's 21.

13:26.700 --> 13:27.867
Thinks he's a gangster.

13:27.967 --> 13:30.367
Clean that off!
( laughing )

13:30.467 --> 13:34.067
It boils my piss
when you come in here
and deface my classroom!

13:34.167 --> 13:35.500
You weren't
supposed to see it.

13:35.600 --> 13:36.834
Joseph: He provokes
the shit out of me.

13:36.934 --> 13:38.500
( groans )
( laughing )

13:38.600 --> 13:39.900
Joseph:
You can't win
an argument with the prick,

13:40.000 --> 13:41.200
no matter
how hard you try.

13:41.300 --> 13:42.934
Sit up
in your chair, thanks.

13:43.034 --> 13:45.400
I'm comfy, Sir.
It's good for my spinals.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.300
Do I make you
stand up all day?

13:47.400 --> 13:49.300
Is that what you wanna do?
My dick wants to stand up.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.400
( laughter )
Fucking...

13:51.500 --> 13:53.934
( grunts )
Calm down, Sir.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.534
You need anger issues.

13:55.634 --> 13:59.234
*

14:02.200 --> 14:03.600
( laughter )

14:07.267 --> 14:09.967
Jonah:
Holy Cross is good
'cause it's Catholic

14:10.067 --> 14:12.767
and you can learn
about Jesus and shit.

14:12.867 --> 14:16.300
And it's good, 'cause it's
got girls as well as boys.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.467
Yeah.
'Cause some schools,
boys only.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.800
They're for homos.
Yeah, homo school.

14:20.900 --> 14:23.434
If you're a homo,
that's the kind of school
you have to go to.

14:23.534 --> 14:25.700
Yeah.
But if you're
like us boys, then--

14:25.800 --> 14:28.067
Brother O'Doherty!
Sir!

14:28.167 --> 14:29.767
Brother O'Doherty!
Look, Sir!

14:29.867 --> 14:31.434
Say hi
to the film crew!

14:31.534 --> 14:33.167
They're filming!

14:33.267 --> 14:36.067
He's a brother,
so no sex for him.
He's Catholic.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.434
That's the rules
of Catholics.

14:37.534 --> 14:40.134
Hey, Sister.
Hey, Sis.
Hey, Sister.

14:40.234 --> 14:42.434
This is Sister Monica.
She's my favorite office lady,

14:42.534 --> 14:45.000
and she's a nun.
She looks after sickbay.

14:45.100 --> 14:47.300
Hey, Sister.
Hello, Jonah.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.900
Hello, boys.
Hello.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.300
Sister, you're sick.
That's why you look
after sickbay,

14:51.400 --> 14:53.134
'cause you're sick,
get it?

14:53.234 --> 14:55.367
I'll take that
as a compliment.
( chuckles )

14:55.467 --> 14:57.100
Even though she's old,
I've got a crush on her.

14:57.200 --> 15:00.700
Boys: Oh, Jonah!
I'm only joking!
I'm joking.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.367
( sings )
( chattering )

15:02.467 --> 15:04.500
Hey, guys! Miss Hunt!
Oh, shit, man!

15:04.600 --> 15:06.300
Jonah:
Holy Cross,
it's good because

15:06.400 --> 15:08.000
you've got some
pretty hot teachers...
Miss!

15:08.100 --> 15:09.700
...like Miss Hunt.
Miss!

15:09.800 --> 15:11.167
Miss, Miss, Miss.

15:11.267 --> 15:13.334
What are we doing
in Design today?
Hi, Miss.

15:13.434 --> 15:14.900
What are we doing?
I'll see you boys--

15:15.000 --> 15:16.667
Are we painting
or some shit?
I'll see you boys

15:16.767 --> 15:19.234
at last period.
Can I have a hug, Miss?
Hug before we go.

15:19.334 --> 15:21.100
Can we have
a hug as well?
Okay, okay.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.734
That's enough, okay.
Can I have
a hug, too, Miss?

15:22.834 --> 15:24.634
Jonah:
Sometimes I even get
to hug Miss Hunt,

15:24.734 --> 15:27.134
and when I hug her,
I press as close as I can

15:27.234 --> 15:28.634
so her boobs
squash against me.

15:28.734 --> 15:30.134
I pully-- I fully
pulled her up to me.

15:30.234 --> 15:32.234
You did?
I felt her boobs.

15:32.334 --> 15:34.834
Jonah:
Holy Cross is good,
'cause it's multicultural,

15:34.934 --> 15:37.067
so you get
all different cultures,

15:37.167 --> 15:39.167
like Fobs, Wogs,

15:39.267 --> 15:41.100
Filos, Curries,

15:41.200 --> 15:43.334
Africans and rangas.

15:43.434 --> 15:45.134
And you also get chick Fobs

15:45.234 --> 15:47.300
chick Wogs, chick Filos

15:47.400 --> 15:50.634
chick Curries,
chick Africans
and chick rangas.

15:50.734 --> 15:54.100
And there's also other
Ching Chongs and Aussies

15:54.200 --> 15:55.634
and all different cultures.
Yeah.

15:55.734 --> 15:57.534
Jonah:
Boys, it's getting
hot around here.

15:57.634 --> 15:59.634
Must be the rangas' heads
making it hot.

15:59.734 --> 16:02.067
Jonah:
Me and my boys,
we get along with everyone

16:02.167 --> 16:03.900
except we hate the rangas.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.300
Israel: Yeah, rangas are gay.
Jonah: They're the worst.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.100
Oi, we need
some welding work done.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.100
Can you boys weld me
something over in Spaz House?
( laughter )

16:09.200 --> 16:10.900
Why don't you weld
your own dicks?

16:11.000 --> 16:13.167
Jonah:
They think they're
so cool and rich and shit,

16:13.267 --> 16:15.434
and their dads drive
expensive cars

16:15.534 --> 16:18.500
and have mansions.
It sucks.

16:18.600 --> 16:21.034
Just 'cause you got
different colored hair to us

16:21.134 --> 16:22.867
doesn't mean you own us.
Boys: Yeah.

16:22.967 --> 16:25.634
Hey, Mosey.
What's up, little guy?
Jonah: Yeah, and the rangas,

16:25.734 --> 16:27.267
they pick on
my little brother Moses

16:27.367 --> 16:28.534
'cause he's got
a teacher's aide

16:28.634 --> 16:30.100
and he did a shit
in his pants

16:30.200 --> 16:31.634
on the first day
of Year 7.

16:31.734 --> 16:32.534
Do you still use nappies

16:32.634 --> 16:33.867
or have you
moved on to pull-ups?

16:33.967 --> 16:35.300
Jonah:
The worst ranga of all

16:35.400 --> 16:37.067
is Graydon.
He's the school captain

16:37.167 --> 16:39.200
and he's a fucking homo.
( blows raspberry )

16:39.300 --> 16:41.200
( laughs )
Jonah:
Me and my boys, we're a crew,

16:41.300 --> 16:42.934
and we're called
"Fobba-liscious."

16:43.034 --> 16:44.200
Boys, show 'em the symbol.

16:44.300 --> 16:45.400
Fobba-liscious.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.100
It's an "F"
for Fobba-liscious

16:47.200 --> 16:49.134
( hip-hop music playing )
( chattering )

16:49.234 --> 16:51.134
Jonah:
And we break-dance...
Whoo-hoo!

16:51.234 --> 16:52.767
...and we sing.
*

16:52.867 --> 16:56.434
* I'm your Island boy,
you're my Island girl *

16:56.534 --> 16:59.300
* Let's be
together forever... *

16:59.400 --> 17:00.867
Jonah:
We write our own songs.

17:00.967 --> 17:02.267
* Pretty young girl

17:02.367 --> 17:05.267
* I want to touch
your boobies, Island girl *

17:05.367 --> 17:07.734
* Let me touch
your boobies... *

17:07.834 --> 17:10.334
Who's got the tweezers?
You've got to do your eyebrows.

17:10.434 --> 17:12.800
( groans )
Jonah:
Fobba-liscious stands

17:12.900 --> 17:16.067
stands for being a Fob
and for being good looking.

17:16.167 --> 17:17.934
The straightener's
gonna burn your bag.

17:18.034 --> 17:20.234
See, us boys,
we like to spend

17:20.334 --> 17:22.067
a lot of time
on our appearance,

17:22.167 --> 17:25.567
making sure that
our skuxness levels are high.

17:25.667 --> 17:27.300
Could straighten the end
of my rat's tail, please?
( chattering )

17:27.400 --> 17:29.234
Let's go talk
to some girls, boys!

17:29.334 --> 17:31.067
Let's do it.
Girls to see.

17:31.167 --> 17:32.500
Jonah:
And even the hot teachers,

17:32.600 --> 17:34.434
they always like
us boys the best,

17:34.534 --> 17:36.034
'cause we are
the most skux boys.

17:36.134 --> 17:38.534
Do I smell nice, Miss?
Smell my armpit.

17:38.634 --> 17:40.267
Hunt: Jonah.
I've got chocolate Lynx on!

17:40.367 --> 17:42.300
Just get on with it,
would you?

17:42.400 --> 17:45.634
I can smell you, Miss.
You smell nice as.

17:45.734 --> 17:47.734
Does your boyfriend
like how you smell?

17:47.834 --> 17:49.767
Hunt: Jonah, shh!
She doesn't have
a boyfriend.

17:49.867 --> 17:52.334
I thought
you were her boyfriend
Do you have one, Miss?

17:52.434 --> 17:54.334
Yeah, it's you.
You should have.

17:54.434 --> 17:56.467
Can you guys just
get on with it, please?

17:56.567 --> 17:57.734
Or are you a lesbian?
Hunt: Shh!

17:57.834 --> 17:59.900
( laughing )
Jonah: And also,

18:00.000 --> 18:01.667
Miss Hunt flirts
with me all the time,

18:01.767 --> 18:04.300
because she can't get
enough of our skuxness.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.534
Don't waste the glue.
It's an experiment, Miss.

18:06.634 --> 18:08.667
No, go and wash it.
No, go and wash your hands...

18:08.767 --> 18:10.534
I'm just gonna let it dry.
...then focus on your
color palette task.

18:10.634 --> 18:12.967
I'm making a glove, Miss.
We don't have much of that.

18:13.067 --> 18:14.400
I'm making
a rubber glove.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.167
I've got to let it dry.
Go and wash your hands.

18:16.267 --> 18:18.067
Go and teach, Miss.

18:18.167 --> 18:20.000
I'm learning shit.
I'm learning shit about art.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.100
Your work's
incomplete, Jonah.
Your dick's incomplete.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.200
( laughter )
Well, I don't have
a dick, Jonah,

18:25.300 --> 18:27.234
so that can't be right.
Oh, what do you
have then, Miss?

18:27.334 --> 18:28.567
Go wash
your hands, please.

18:28.667 --> 18:32.300
I'm fed up, Jonah.
You better watch it

18:32.400 --> 18:34.767
or I'll get--
I'll get Mr. Joseph in here.
Go teach. Go teach.

18:34.867 --> 18:36.600
Go do what
you're paid to do.
Boy: Miss. Miss.

18:36.700 --> 18:39.234
Jonah: Miss.
Create another line
on the bottom.

18:39.334 --> 18:41.400
Miss, I need your help
with my color palette.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.700
No, look at your work.
It's incomplete.

18:43.800 --> 18:46.434
You haven't
even tried today.
Your dick hasn't even tried.

18:46.534 --> 18:48.134
Sorry.
Stop getting turned on
by me, Miss.

18:48.234 --> 18:50.467
Come on,
you're almost there. Shh.

18:50.567 --> 18:52.067
Do you wanna stay
in with me at lunchtime?
Yes.

18:52.167 --> 18:53.867
Yes. Oh yeah, Miss.

18:53.967 --> 18:57.034
You'll be too old
by the time I'm 18,
so no thanks.

18:57.134 --> 18:59.167
Now you've got a yellow--
You've got to get Botox.

18:59.267 --> 19:01.000
Ignore me if you think

19:01.100 --> 19:03.600
I am disgusting.
I think you like the sound
of your own voice, Jonah.

19:03.700 --> 19:06.500
I think you like the sound
of your own dick.
( laughter )

19:06.600 --> 19:08.900
Mr. Joseph's got
a no-tolerance policy

19:09.000 --> 19:11.867
on me doing
my tag "dick-tation"
around the school,

19:11.967 --> 19:14.500
so I had to invent a new tag.
It's called "pussycat."

19:14.600 --> 19:16.867
I'll show ya.
It's a girl's pussy

19:16.967 --> 19:20.167
and the you write "cat."

19:20.267 --> 19:21.934
( boys chatter )
It's my tag. Pussycat.

19:22.034 --> 19:24.234
Outside school,
Jonah's "Dick-tation."

19:24.334 --> 19:26.134
Inside school,
he's "Pussycat."

19:26.234 --> 19:28.767
Boys, what are you doing?

19:28.867 --> 19:30.367
Nothing.
What are you doing?

19:30.467 --> 19:32.134
Manu:
Oh yeah,
Jonah's a good friend,

19:32.234 --> 19:34.534
but Jonah, he tells
lies all the time.
Bullshit.

19:34.634 --> 19:36.667
Boys:
You do. You do.
You talk--

19:36.767 --> 19:38.434
what about when
you said Nicki Minaj
was coming to assembly?

19:38.534 --> 19:40.000
Yeah!
I thought
she was coming!

19:40.100 --> 19:41.067
Miss told me she was.
Such a liar, man.

19:41.167 --> 19:42.567
You're a liar, siana.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.200
And you tell
really bad jokes as well.

19:44.300 --> 19:45.867
Bullshit.
My jokes are good.

19:45.967 --> 19:48.300
What did the school
say to my dick?
Boys: What?

19:48.400 --> 19:50.034
"Get in my classroom."
( laughter )

19:50.134 --> 19:53.167
What did the priest say when
I punched him in the dick?
Boys: What?

19:53.267 --> 19:55.234
"You're a dickhead!"
( laughter )

19:55.334 --> 19:56.967
Joseph:
Is Jonah better off
here than in Tonga?

19:57.067 --> 19:59.400
That's a good question.
Oh, he's probably
better off here.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.434
I hear
Tonga's pretty shit.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.167
Will he survive
to the end of Year 12?

20:03.267 --> 20:05.700
I doubt it,
but we'll give it

20:05.800 --> 20:07.734
a red-hot crack.
Stranger things have happened.

20:07.834 --> 20:10.234
What do you call
a fish at the bottom
of a ocean with a dick?

20:10.334 --> 20:12.234
Boys: What?
Fishy dick.

20:14.534 --> 20:15.834
( chattering )

20:15.934 --> 20:17.900
Jonah:
Let's do it here, boys.
Manu: Right here.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.567
( hip-hop music playing )

20:19.667 --> 20:21.067
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!

20:21.167 --> 20:24.400
Yeah.
( chattering )

20:24.500 --> 20:27.400
Fuck off!
Don't go through
our dance area!

20:27.500 --> 20:29.967
Who are you?
Hey. Melody. Melody.

20:30.067 --> 20:31.900
Melody! Melody.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.967
Come over here.
Let me show you
my dance moves.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.300
Whoo-hey!
She's your cousin.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.000
I don't care.
She's our cousin.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.634
I don't care
if she's my cousin.

20:39.734 --> 20:41.934
Your dad's gonna care, bro.
She's skux as.

20:42.034 --> 20:44.900
Mr. Joseph!
Mr. Joseph.
Mr. Joseph.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.134
Mr. Joseph!
Mr. Joseph.

20:48.234 --> 20:51.400
Stop the car.
Stop the car, Mr. Joseph.
What are you doing, sir?

20:51.500 --> 20:53.500
Bring it here, sir.
Sir, check this out.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.900
( boys shout )
Check this out.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.534
What are
you idiots up to?

20:57.634 --> 21:00.134
Sir. Sir,
what's the code word?

21:00.234 --> 21:01.900
To go past, Sir,
you say the code word.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.934
See, I don't actually
need a code word.
Yes, you do.

21:04.034 --> 21:05.334
Stop loitering
around the streets.

21:05.434 --> 21:07.200
You're making names
for yourselves.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.334
Come on.
I've already got a name
for myself-- Jonah.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.600
Boys: Yeah.
Don't be a fucking dickhead
all your life.

21:11.700 --> 21:13.600
What is this
hori as car, sir?
Get a new car.

21:13.700 --> 21:16.267
I'm serious. Just--
Don't they pay you
enough, sir?

21:16.367 --> 21:18.034
This is shit.
Moses:
Hori car.

21:18.134 --> 21:19.734
You wouldn't bother
paying for it.
Whatever. Off you go.

21:19.834 --> 21:22.067
Sir, I don't have to listen
to what you say, sir,

21:22.167 --> 21:23.967
'cause we're not on school
ground, so it doesn't
matter what you say.

21:24.067 --> 21:26.500
So why don't you
marry your own car...
( car honking )

21:26.600 --> 21:28.434
...and go?
You're blocking
the road, sir!

21:28.534 --> 21:31.967
You're blocking the road.
Sorry, car. Sorry.

21:32.067 --> 21:34.400
Through.
It's just our idiot teacher!

21:34.500 --> 21:36.034
Go cook dinner!
( boys shout )

21:36.134 --> 21:37.967
Go have sex
with your wife.

21:38.067 --> 21:40.234
Jonah:
When I first
came back from Tonga.

21:40.334 --> 21:42.600
I did a few naughty things.

21:42.700 --> 21:45.634
Like, I got busted by the cops
for a bit of shoplifting.

21:45.734 --> 21:47.200
Manu:
Remember, mate,
you stole five boxes

21:47.300 --> 21:48.867
of strawberry Hubba Bubba.
Jonah: Yeah!

21:48.967 --> 21:50.567
Siana, what did
you do that for?
That's a waste.

21:50.667 --> 21:52.567
I did it 'cause I love
strawberry Hubba Bubba.

21:52.667 --> 21:56.000
And the cops came to my house,
and I didn't go to juvie for it,

21:56.100 --> 21:57.567
but I got a criminal record.

21:57.667 --> 22:00.067
And I had to--
I had to, like, get

22:00.167 --> 22:02.067
a hiding from my dad
for doing it.

22:02.167 --> 22:04.967
Even Moses.
He got busted by the police

22:05.067 --> 22:08.800
'cause at school
he cut off this Year 7
homo's rat's tail.

22:08.900 --> 22:11.300
( laughter )
( chattering )

22:11.400 --> 22:13.700
Jonah: But that's when
I used to be naughty.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.400
But us boys now...
But now--

22:15.500 --> 22:18.100
...we're all good boys. Yeah.
Yeah. We're all good now.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.667
Because it doesn't matter
if you're naughty,

22:20.767 --> 22:24.100
'cause t doesn't get you any
money and you have no future.
Yeah, yeah.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.134
( hip-hop music on radio )
Israel: Act cool.

22:25.234 --> 22:27.134
Jonah: Georgie.

22:28.334 --> 22:29.934
What's up?
What you boys doing?

22:30.034 --> 22:32.167
Nothing, bro.
Georgie.

22:32.267 --> 22:33.600
Cruising, bro.
'Sup, boys?

22:33.700 --> 22:35.334
We were just at school.
Jonah: The Soldiers,

22:35.434 --> 22:37.167
they're these mean as boys.
Moses: Yeah.

22:37.267 --> 22:39.400
Jonah:
George from the Soldiers,
George Kakalukai,

22:39.500 --> 22:42.067
he's the toughest guy
in the whole fucking area.

22:42.167 --> 22:44.200
Way.
Yeah, these boys

22:44.300 --> 22:47.034
have the most money
of any boys their age.

22:47.134 --> 22:49.134
They're older than us
and they have--

22:49.234 --> 22:52.800
they have really cool cars.
They went to uni.

22:52.900 --> 22:55.234
And if that's what
you get for going to uni...
Yeah.

22:55.334 --> 22:57.000
...then I'm definitely
going to uni.

22:57.100 --> 23:00.134
You guys like cameras?
Yeah. Yeah.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.800
Ah.
This your camera?

23:02.900 --> 23:04.367
It's yours now,
brother.

23:04.467 --> 23:06.100
We can keep this?
Are we allowed
to keep it?

23:06.200 --> 23:08.567
Yeah, man.
Awesome. This looks
expensive as, dox.

23:08.667 --> 23:11.100
I don't know, bro.
Don't, don't, don't.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.034
Don't drop it.
Go film some shit, man.

23:13.134 --> 23:15.634
Yeah, I've got
to go away.

23:15.734 --> 23:16.967
Watch it.
Later, boys.

23:17.067 --> 23:18.767
Thanks.
See ya.
Later, boys.

23:18.867 --> 23:21.600
Thanks a bunch, yeah.
Oh my Gosh!

23:21.700 --> 23:23.367
( boys chatter )

23:23.467 --> 23:26.134
Picture, picture, picture.
Israel: Hurry up!

23:28.934 --> 23:31.267
Jonah, Jonah,
Jonah, Jonah.

23:31.367 --> 23:32.934
Do you reckon Dad
will let us keep it?

23:33.034 --> 23:35.267
( family singing
in Tongan )

23:58.034 --> 24:00.367
Ah! ( laughs )
Shut the fuck up!

24:00.467 --> 24:02.834
Do you wanna get belted?
No.

24:02.934 --> 24:05.334
Show some respect.
Sucked in.

24:05.434 --> 24:08.234
Shut up, you two.
Start singing.

24:08.334 --> 24:10.000
Grace:
Oh, he's okay.

24:10.100 --> 24:13.467
He's a little bit
naughty, and...

24:13.567 --> 24:15.500
a little bit trouble.
( laughs )

24:15.600 --> 24:20.434
Jonah is a special one
in Rocky's kid.

24:20.534 --> 24:22.767
His mom
Theresa always say that.

24:22.867 --> 24:27.067
His mom die when Jonah
was six year old,

24:27.167 --> 24:28.634
from liver cancer.

24:28.734 --> 24:30.334
It's very sad.

24:30.434 --> 24:33.567
Very, very sad
for the whole family.

24:33.667 --> 24:36.467
But his mom

24:36.567 --> 24:40.300
He always that
Jonah is a special one.

24:40.400 --> 24:43.567
He has a magical eyes,

24:43.667 --> 24:46.900
and one day
he will be do a good work.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.934
Both:
* Close your eyes

24:49.034 --> 24:52.934
* Give me
your hand, darling *

24:53.034 --> 24:57.334
* Do you feel
my heart beating? *

24:57.434 --> 25:00.534
* Do you understand?

25:00.634 --> 25:02.834
Jonah:
When my mom died,
I was pretty dumb.

25:02.934 --> 25:06.467
I didn't even know.
I thought she just
went to Tonga.

25:06.567 --> 25:11.134
* I believe
it's meant to be *

25:11.234 --> 25:12.867
* Darling...

25:12.967 --> 25:15.800
Jonah:
But my mom Theresa,

25:15.900 --> 25:17.967
she said
that when I was little,

25:18.067 --> 25:20.267
I was magical.

25:20.367 --> 25:22.334
Of all the boys
in the family,

25:22.434 --> 25:25.167
I was the magical one.
*

25:25.267 --> 25:26.600
Let's do the Takalua link.
( swishes )

25:26.700 --> 25:29.267
Jonah:
And sometimes
when I go to bed...

25:29.367 --> 25:31.900
Pull on me.
...I wish she was here
to kiss me.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.567
( grunting)
Nothing breaks the link.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.867
Ah!
( laughter )

25:39.300 --> 25:40.467
Don't fucking touch me!

25:40.567 --> 25:42.534
And now I'm 14,
I've got my tattoo

25:42.634 --> 25:46.200
and I've got my mom
watching over me.

25:46.300 --> 25:49.034
Nothing bad
can ever happen to me.

25:49.134 --> 25:50.867
Aunty Grace!

25:50.967 --> 25:52.334
Good night, boys.

25:52.434 --> 25:54.100
Boys: Night night.
Good night, Aunty.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.500
Hey, Aunty,
you're looking sexy tonight.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.667
( boys laugh )
You better watch your mouth.

25:58.767 --> 26:01.034
If your dad hear you,
you've got trouble.

26:01.134 --> 26:03.367
She's your aunty,
you disgusting freak.

26:03.467 --> 26:07.234
Only joking.
Why don't you get out
of our room anyway, fatty?

26:07.334 --> 26:09.600
Go to the fat room!
( boys laugh )

Go to bed, shit for brains.
Go to bed, fat for brains.

Good night, Aunty.

26:17.067 --> 26:19.134
Hey, boys,
who wants a joke?
What?

26:19.234 --> 26:20.500
Yeah.
Me.

26:20.600 --> 26:24.134
Um, what did the carpet
say to the door?

26:24.234 --> 26:27.400
Boys: What?
"Get your dick
out of my door hole."

26:27.500 --> 26:30.534
( laughter )

26:30.634 --> 26:32.734
What did the window
say to the moon?

26:40.467 --> 26:42.600
You're gonna be good?
Yeah, I'm always good.

26:42.700 --> 26:45.500
Bullshit.
You're always a fuckwit.
You're setting it on fire, bro.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.067
You're fucked.
I didn't do anything.

26:47.167 --> 26:49.034
There's a new youth worker.

26:49.134 --> 26:52.034
He's into singing,
dancing and shit.
Hey, boys, come join in!

26:52.134 --> 26:54.567
Get the fuck outta here.
Stop being a fucking gaylord.
All right, all right.

26:54.667 --> 26:56.000
Stop perving on us!

26:56.100 --> 26:58.067
This is a Fobba-liscious

Joseph:
I just had a kid's dad
on the phone.

27:01.434 --> 27:04.367
Now he gets
the cops involved,
we're all fucked.

27:04.467 --> 27:06.767
( cheers, applause )
Whoo! Yeah!

27:06.867 --> 27:08.300
You fucking idiot!

27:08.400 --> 27:11.667
