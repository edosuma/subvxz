His brother was in a body bag.

00:26.777 --> 00:28.738
Before he put himself
in that bag,

Travis Strout was on his way
from somewhere, maybe here.

00:31.323 --> 00:32.491
From here to Northridge?

Three Oh Eights make Craver

15:47.697 --> 15:50.784
that could be connected to the
shoot-out with the sovereigns.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.454
Off the record?

15:57.707 --> 16:01.002
We have a credible threat
to public safety.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.629
An inaccurate Times article

16:02.671 --> 16:05.173
will only exacerbate
the situation.

16:06.925 --> 16:09.552
On the record?

16:09.594 --> 16:11.805
I want to find the killers
of my detectives.

16:11.846 --> 16:14.099
And you can run
with what I've given you.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.809
Enlist the public's help.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.894
So I can quote you?

16:17.936 --> 16:19.896
You can quote a highly placed,

16:19.938 --> 16:22.107
-unnamed source at PAB.
-You said "on the record."

16:22.148 --> 16:23.733
You said "on the record."

16:23.775 --> 16:25.026
(scoffs softly)

16:27.278 --> 16:28.947
In return?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.907
An exclusive follow-up.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.494
With I.A.

16:37.455 --> 16:38.998
(exhales)

16:43.044 --> 16:44.212
Do we have a deal?

16:46.256 --> 16:49.092
I'll break the bad news
to Scott.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.235
-Got it. Thanks.
-(engine turns off)

17:08.486 --> 17:11.072
REECE:
House belongs to a woman named

17:11.114 --> 17:12.824
Louise Hansen.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.117
Sovereign?

17:14.159 --> 17:15.535
Fellow traveler.

17:17.454 --> 17:19.998
REECE:
I don't get these folks.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.249
True believers.

17:21.291 --> 17:22.876
They're dangerous.

17:22.917 --> 17:26.880
Wonder what it's like
to see the world that way.

17:28.256 --> 17:32.093
Have a... theory
that explains everything.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.930
Can't imagine. Must be nice.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.223
Yeah, me, either.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.732
So Eleanor Wish was your ex?

17:48.109 --> 17:50.320
She was.

17:50.361 --> 17:52.197
Ever cross paths?

17:52.238 --> 17:55.450
Just... heard the stories.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.787
True stories
or the company line?

17:58.828 --> 18:00.622
(chuckles softly)

18:00.663 --> 18:02.290
Both.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.378
I'm sorry.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.589
For what happened to her.

18:12.634 --> 18:15.386
As am I.

18:15.428 --> 18:18.097
Some things can't be explained.

18:21.684 --> 18:23.478
You look like shit, man.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.939
I haven't been home,
couple of days.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.944
So...

18:30.985 --> 18:33.321
I.A. closing in.

18:33.363 --> 18:36.407
And before Marcos and Arias
can be arrested? Bang, bang.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.867
Take 'em off the board.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.202
They would have flipped.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.787
Jacques Avril.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.789
(sighs):
Can't prove it...

18:42.831 --> 18:44.707
but I know it in my bones.

18:44.749 --> 18:46.668
Marcos and Arias shoot
your C.I.?

18:46.709 --> 18:48.294
Couple Jamaicans.

18:48.336 --> 18:50.755
That work for Jacques Avril.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.423
Can you talk
to your Jamaican C.I.?

18:52.465 --> 18:54.467
You know how that is.

18:54.509 --> 18:56.594
They only confirm
what you already know.

18:56.636 --> 19:00.265
If I knew for a fact,
I wouldn't be asking.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.022
(sighs)
I don't mind the sofa.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.649
Oh, stay as long as you need.

19:09.691 --> 19:11.734
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

19:11.776 --> 19:14.612
Um, Bobby set that up.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.948
-Smart kid.
-Mm-hmm.

19:18.408 --> 19:20.785
When the true story
of this time is written,

19:20.827 --> 19:24.330
Travis'll go down
as a martyr of the movement.

19:24.372 --> 19:25.707
Hmm.

19:38.094 --> 19:41.514
(car approaching)

19:58.323 --> 20:00.325
(tapping keyboard)

20:17.717 --> 20:19.928
(helicopter approaching)

20:22.388 --> 20:24.807
(helicopter blades whirring
in distance)

20:44.285 --> 20:45.703
Dad?

20:46.746 --> 20:47.956
Oh.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.751
(groans)

20:55.463 --> 20:57.048
Morning.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.804
(whispers):
Shit.

21:02.845 --> 21:04.973
What time is it?

21:05.014 --> 21:07.725
6:30.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.353
Kind of early for work.

21:10.395 --> 21:12.397
There's a lot to do.

21:17.819 --> 21:19.779
You gonna tell me
what's going on?

21:21.823 --> 21:24.909
Did you tell Chandler
about that shady plea deal?

21:26.452 --> 21:28.413
-She seemed pleased.
-Good.

21:30.456 --> 21:32.417
Job suits you.

21:32.458 --> 21:35.336
You're a grinder like your mama.

21:35.378 --> 21:36.671
Like you, you mean.

21:37.714 --> 21:40.967
Like both of us.

21:42.010 --> 21:43.845
(whispers):
Dad.

21:46.848 --> 21:48.850
Okay.

21:50.852 --> 21:52.854
Okay.

21:55.857 --> 21:59.610
A week ago,
a doctor was murdered,

21:59.652 --> 22:01.237
and radioactive material

22:01.279 --> 22:03.281
was stolen from a hospital.

22:05.283 --> 22:07.410
Why?

22:07.452 --> 22:09.037
Domestic terrorism.

22:09.078 --> 22:11.622
Dirty bomb, maybe.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.249
Nothing good.

22:14.459 --> 22:16.419
Trying to find the killers

22:16.461 --> 22:19.380
and the missing
nuclear material.

22:19.422 --> 22:21.382
God.

22:21.424 --> 22:23.384
You are gonna find them.

22:23.426 --> 22:25.428
We will.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.347
We will.

22:32.977 --> 22:35.938
Well, then I'm going to work.

22:36.981 --> 22:39.776
Not gonna let
the terrorists win.

22:41.402 --> 22:44.280
What we said after 9/11.

22:44.322 --> 22:46.324
And you were right.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.576
Nothing big like that
has happened since.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.203
Not yet.

22:52.205 --> 22:53.414
Be careful.

22:54.457 --> 22:56.459
Always.

23:00.254 --> 23:01.380
And Mads?

23:02.548 --> 23:04.217
Between us, yeah?

23:04.258 --> 23:06.260
Of course.

23:07.345 --> 23:09.305
Love you.

23:09.347 --> 23:11.933
(door closes)

23:14.977 --> 23:17.939
Oh, Pierce and Vega
have been busy.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.482
Kent's phone records.

23:19.524 --> 23:21.484
Office, home, cell.

23:21.526 --> 23:24.070
(exhales)
Patrol just called in a body.

23:24.112 --> 23:26.948
Wilcox and Franklin.
Weird burns and blisters.

23:26.989 --> 23:29.367
Buy us 30 minutes with the Feds
before they send the circus in?

23:29.408 --> 23:31.077
I'll try.

23:41.546 --> 23:43.506
He looks fried.

23:43.548 --> 23:46.050
Like he fell in a vat
of hot grease.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.802
Check his torso.

23:47.844 --> 23:49.345
You got a pen?

23:54.058 --> 23:55.810
Jesus.

24:03.484 --> 24:05.486
I.D.?

24:10.867 --> 24:12.869
Alberto Gonzalves.

24:19.917 --> 24:23.838
Mexican transit paper.
Country of origin, El Salvador.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.382
Long way from there to here.

24:27.425 --> 24:29.302
He walked every mile of it.

24:35.892 --> 24:38.769
Rodriguez, see if you can
track down any family,

24:38.811 --> 24:41.147
here or in El Salvador.
Clear the area.

24:41.189 --> 24:43.858
DOE and FBI hazmat's
gonna be here any minute.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.234
Yes, sir.

24:48.571 --> 24:50.531
That thing busted?

24:50.573 --> 24:51.908
(chuckles softly)

24:51.949 --> 24:54.035
You should really read
the stuff they send us.

24:54.076 --> 24:55.411
Unless we're talking Chernobyl,

24:55.453 --> 24:58.456
a dead body
does not emit radiation.

25:03.628 --> 25:05.421
Hollywood Recycling.

25:07.590 --> 25:10.843
I haven't seen Alberto
since the day before yesterday.

25:10.885 --> 25:11.969
I've been worried.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.262
He's here every day.

25:13.304 --> 25:14.597
Where does he live?

25:14.639 --> 25:17.975
Broke down VW Vanagon.
Two-tone blue.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.102
My first boyfriend had one.

25:20.144 --> 25:21.854
Perfect for drive-in movies.

25:21.896 --> 25:23.439
Broke down where?

25:23.481 --> 25:25.816
Up the hill, off Outpost.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.193
Near the reservoir.

25:27.235 --> 25:29.445
Within walking distance.

25:29.487 --> 25:30.780
Thank you.

25:30.821 --> 25:32.448
You're welcome.

27:35.529 --> 27:37.156
Reece, we found the cesium.

27:37.198 --> 27:38.574
Further.

27:51.629 --> 27:53.589
REECE:
This sector was
the first one cleared.

27:53.631 --> 27:55.758
He must've found the pig
and opened it after that.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.259
We got lucky.

27:57.301 --> 27:58.928
Could have been a lot worse.

27:58.969 --> 28:00.346
What're they looking for?

28:00.388 --> 28:02.348
Trace radiation.

28:02.390 --> 28:03.766
The fuck didn't you call us

28:03.808 --> 28:05.184
-soon as you found the body?
-BOSCH: Had a lead.

28:05.226 --> 28:06.352
Wanted to find the cesium

28:06.394 --> 28:07.853
before another citizen
tripped over it.

28:07.895 --> 28:09.730
A sovereign?

28:09.772 --> 28:11.190
Immigrant. Undocumented.

28:11.232 --> 28:12.942
Nothing to do with the murder
of Stanley Kent?

28:12.983 --> 28:14.068
EDGAR:
Stumbled across something

28:14.110 --> 28:15.778
that looked valuable,
brought it home.

28:15.820 --> 28:17.738
All right.
We'll take it from here.

28:17.780 --> 28:20.074
You and Edgar need to go
to the hospital. Now.

28:20.116 --> 28:21.242
Fuck that. We're fine.

28:21.283 --> 28:22.326
It's not negotiable.

28:25.746 --> 28:26.997
The lenient sentence
was appropriate.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.249
He's a petty criminal.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.793
CHANDLER:
A career petty criminal.

28:30.835 --> 28:32.962
And this was felony possession.
Looking at serious time.

28:33.003 --> 28:35.756
And what he got
was a slap on the wrist,

28:35.798 --> 28:37.800
reduced by time served
to ten months.

28:37.842 --> 28:39.885
My client had information
on an unrelated murder

28:39.927 --> 28:41.470
the people were anxious

28:41.512 --> 28:43.013
-to close.
-Your plea deal

28:43.055 --> 28:45.307
was never disclosed
to Dante Crow's attorney.

28:45.349 --> 28:47.852
The court acknowledged it.
Wasn't our responsibility.

28:47.893 --> 28:49.645
Where are you going with this?

28:50.771 --> 28:52.356
CHANDLER:
The D.A. makes

28:52.398 --> 28:54.150
a lenient plea bargain
with your client,

28:54.191 --> 28:55.985
the key witness
against Dante Crow,

28:56.026 --> 28:57.695
and then withholds
that information

28:57.736 --> 28:59.363
-from Crow's attorney.
-(phone vibrates)

28:59.405 --> 29:00.990
It goes where it goes.

29:01.031 --> 29:03.826
Yes, I'm sure that it does.

29:03.868 --> 29:05.161
Are you okay?

29:05.202 --> 29:06.996
Will you excuse me?

29:07.037 --> 29:09.415
Uh, sure.

29:09.457 --> 29:11.709
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Rothman to Radiology.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.461
Dr. Rothman to Radiology.

29:13.502 --> 29:15.337
(indistinct chatter)

29:22.261 --> 29:24.138
The sign says radiation.

29:24.180 --> 29:26.474
Got the all clear.
I'm just waiting on the nurse.

29:26.515 --> 29:30.060
(sighs)
I brought you clothes.

29:30.102 --> 29:33.022
I kind of dig this.

29:33.063 --> 29:34.773
Are you okay?

29:34.815 --> 29:37.443
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Doc says
I'd get more radiation flying

29:37.485 --> 29:39.403
-to New York City.
-Can I hug you?

29:39.445 --> 29:40.863
(chuckles)
Yeah, of course. Of course.

29:40.905 --> 29:42.239
Oh, no.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.824
Now you're gonna glow
in the dark.

29:43.866 --> 29:45.826
Funny. Not.

29:45.868 --> 29:48.454
Seriously, you okay?

29:48.496 --> 29:51.248
Yeah. I'm gonna kind of miss
my old boots, though.

29:51.290 --> 29:52.875
What about Jerry?

29:52.917 --> 29:53.959
(chuckles):
Jerry.

29:54.001 --> 29:55.461
Jerry's pissed.
He's-he's really pissed.

29:55.503 --> 29:57.379
They made him pitch
his three-piece suit and a pair

29:57.421 --> 30:00.925
of $400 To Boot New York
dress shoes, so...

30:02.968 --> 30:04.637
So...

30:04.678 --> 30:06.347
you found it?

30:06.388 --> 30:08.390
We found it.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.492
(indistinct chatter)

30:56.105 --> 30:58.107
(chatter continues)

31:21.088 --> 31:23.924
(siren wailing in distance)

31:39.898 --> 31:41.567
That for us?

31:41.609 --> 31:43.235
Everything we got.

31:43.277 --> 31:44.653
Pad out your murder book.

31:44.695 --> 31:46.697
BOSCH:
Murder books, plural.

31:46.739 --> 31:49.325
Kent and Craver,
both still open.

31:49.366 --> 31:51.577
-Travis Strout killed Kent.
-We don't know that yet.

31:51.619 --> 31:52.828
Most likely Craver,
too, but hey,

31:52.870 --> 31:54.038
you want to chase your tails?

31:54.079 --> 31:55.414
Have at it. Big picture?

31:55.456 --> 31:57.082
Cesium's recovered.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.167
Terrorist cell's busted.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.710
Catastrophe averted.

31:59.752 --> 32:01.295
Another victory
in the war on terror.

32:01.337 --> 32:02.588
Thanks.

32:06.342 --> 32:10.220
The Strouts go to all
that trouble for the cesium,

32:10.262 --> 32:14.099
and then just drop it
on the side of the road?

32:14.141 --> 32:16.226
Maybe they didn't have it.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.605
What if Kent hid the pig

32:19.647 --> 32:20.939
on his way to the Overlook?

32:20.981 --> 32:22.441
-Why would he do that?
-Insurance.

32:22.483 --> 32:24.109
Afraid they wouldn't
let his wife go

32:24.151 --> 32:25.444
once they got
their hands on it.

32:25.486 --> 32:27.529
He won't give it up,
they dump him.

32:27.571 --> 32:29.114
Why kill Kent, but not his wife?

32:29.156 --> 32:31.241
Like I said, shit went sideways
at the Overlook.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.285
The wife is a loose end.

32:33.327 --> 32:35.621
They'd circle back
for her regardless.

32:35.663 --> 32:36.789
Unless cesium wasn't
the objective.

32:36.830 --> 32:37.956

32:37.998 --> 32:39.083

-Which you've broken
how many times?
-Never.

32:48.676 --> 32:51.011
(chuckles)
So...

32:51.053 --> 32:54.515
aside from the Strouts,
who'd want Stanley Kent dead?

32:55.974 --> 32:57.893

33:37.015 --> 33:39.226
Never date cops.

Only date cops.
