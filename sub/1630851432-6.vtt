WEBVTT

00:29.362 --> 00:30.780
Wow.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.161
So, what do you think?

00:36.745 --> 00:38.246
Should we go in?

00:39.372 --> 00:43.168
Well, if I was going to step into
a portal to Whereverland,

00:43.251 --> 00:46.337
I'm defs not doing it
on the advice of a talking rat.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.632
Valid point. How does Fink
even know about all this?

00:49.716 --> 00:54.220
And what else isn't he telling us?
This could all be a trick.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.598
We've got to interrogate him. Now.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.103
-Blaine.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.688
-Don't answer it.
-Don't go there!

01:03.772 --> 01:04.773
Blaine.

01:04.856 --> 01:06.274
Don't answer it!

01:06.816 --> 01:09.194
Uh, hi, Blaine. What's up?

01:09.778 --> 01:11.654
So, I'm at the pumpkin patch,

01:11.738 --> 01:13.948
setting up for the festival tonight,

01:14.032 --> 01:17.786
and I don't see you guys anywhere.

01:17.869 --> 01:20.205
Oh, that's right!

01:20.288 --> 01:23.625
We offered to help with Principal McKay's
Pumpkin Bowl Extravaganza.

01:23.708 --> 01:24.959
We can't go!

01:25.043 --> 01:26.169
Wah!

01:26.252 --> 01:29.839
You know how seriously
Principal McKay takes bowling, right?

01:29.923 --> 01:33.551
The scarecrow pins
are not gonna put themselves up.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.220
I don't want to go.

01:35.303 --> 01:39.015
Those pumpkin-headed scarecrows
are so spooky.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.643
We have a talking rat to deal with.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.561
I know, but I can't tell her that!

01:43.645 --> 01:44.729
No, no, no!

01:44.813 --> 01:47.106
-Okay, Blaine, we're on our way.
-No, no, no!

01:48.024 --> 01:49.609
Wrench in our plans.

01:49.692 --> 01:52.195
If only we could be in two places at once.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.825
-Who says we can't?

01:59.452 --> 02:01.788
Yes! Fake it till you make it!

02:01.871 --> 02:05.750
This spell makes doppelgangers,
perfect look-alikes.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.503
And we'll find Fink
while they go do our work.

02:09.087 --> 02:11.005
See, I like where this is going,

02:11.089 --> 02:15.426
but we didn't exactly
nail the spells at school yesterday.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.847
We don't have time to look back.

02:18.930 --> 02:21.516
"Where there was one
There now will be two"

02:21.599 --> 02:23.935
"Come into this world
Head to shoe!"

02:28.106 --> 02:31.109
-Whoa…

02:31.943 --> 02:33.153
-Uh…
-Ah!

02:33.236 --> 02:35.613
-Wow.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.740
-Ha…

02:39.617 --> 02:44.205
-They seem kind of… off.

02:44.289 --> 02:47.041
I do not want to be
seen in public like that.

02:47.709 --> 02:51.087
We really have to find Fink and
get to the bottom of what this portal is.

02:51.588 --> 02:55.258
They'll be us, we'll be cats,
and no one will be the wiser.

02:57.302 --> 03:00.096
Are you girls ready
to go to the Pumpkin Bowl?

03:00.179 --> 03:01.180
-Pumpkin!
-Pumpkin!

03:01.264 --> 03:02.140
-Pumpkin!
-Pumpkin!

03:02.223 --> 03:03.057
-Pumpkin!
-Pumpkin!

03:03.141 --> 03:04.017
-Pumpkin!
-Pumpkin!

03:04.100 --> 03:07.312
-Oh boy…

03:56.486 --> 03:59.030
I know I said we should go after Fink,

03:59.113 --> 04:04.244
but this new plan
seems to have trouble written all over it.

04:04.994 --> 04:08.164
Any problem that comes up,
we can solve it with magic.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.041
I mean, look at what we just did!

04:12.585 --> 04:14.587
-Yeah…

04:15.380 --> 04:17.048
If you say so.

04:20.301 --> 04:21.261
Hello, Willa.

04:21.344 --> 04:23.596
I'm Willa.
Nice to meet you, Willa.

04:23.680 --> 04:29.060
Willa you be wanting to hang out today,
or willa you be doing your own thing?

04:30.520 --> 04:31.354
Yeah.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.440
What could possibly go wrong?

04:37.443 --> 04:39.654
Okay, girls. Listen up.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.782
You guys are going to
go work at the Pumpkin Bowl

04:42.865 --> 04:44.951
while we take care of
important cat business.

04:45.034 --> 04:46.035
Understand?

04:46.869 --> 04:49.455
Understand like a rubber band.

04:51.708 --> 04:56.212
-Okay, that snort is not cool.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.798
Listen, you guys just need to focus, okay?

04:58.881 --> 05:01.718
Be normal, like us.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.344
No prob!

05:03.428 --> 05:05.054
We're the woosters!

05:05.138 --> 05:07.598
The woosters! The woosters! The woosters!

05:07.682 --> 05:10.768
Wisters. We're the wisters.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.061
The washtubs!

05:12.145 --> 05:13.604
We love to wash tubs!

05:13.688 --> 05:16.190
-Washtubs! Washtubs!

05:16.274 --> 05:17.108
That way, girls.

05:17.900 --> 05:19.861
We are the washtubs!

05:21.029 --> 05:23.281
Washtubs!

05:26.367 --> 05:28.995
-Come on!

05:30.496 --> 05:33.458
Okay. Time to find Fink!

05:35.877 --> 05:38.963
It's not perfect timing.
I'd much prefer to be home right now

05:39.047 --> 05:41.424
picking at my toenails or
something more fun, but I--

05:41.507 --> 05:44.093
-Sh! Get down! Neil is inside!
-What? What? What?

05:44.177 --> 05:47.930
Um, excuse me,
why are you shushing me over Neil?

05:48.014 --> 05:51.726
Because up until now,
his kid has outsmarted us all.

05:51.809 --> 05:56.147
She is harder to catch than
spotted salamanders on a slippery log.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.941
Which is why we capture someone easier.

05:59.025 --> 06:02.695
Someone who will lure her right to us.

06:04.655 --> 06:08.493
Hot diggity doggies! Dog doggies.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.369
-Who?

06:11.370 --> 06:12.288
Neil.

06:12.371 --> 06:14.207
I got some hot dogs.

06:14.707 --> 06:17.418
Diggity dogs.
Diggity-dog time!

06:17.502 --> 06:19.879
Are you sure this is a good idea?

06:19.962 --> 06:21.798
Anyone have a better one?

06:22.298 --> 06:25.343
Hi, Daddy! We're off to
go help decorate the Pumpkin Bowl.

06:25.426 --> 06:29.472
Daddy? Aw, you haven't
called me Daddy since you were three.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.849
-I was three?!
-Whoa…

06:36.229 --> 06:38.981
Uh, see? What could go wrong?

06:40.817 --> 06:42.568
Hey, um, speaking of days gone by,

06:42.652 --> 06:46.197
uh, yesterday feels,
you know, still a little blurry.

06:47.198 --> 06:50.868
Uh, you know, like, uh,
I don't know, do you guys remember--

06:50.952 --> 06:53.162
-May I please have a carrot?
-A carrot?

06:53.246 --> 06:55.414
Uh, yeah.
In the fridge. Help yourself.

06:55.998 --> 07:00.044
Anyway, as I was saying, uh,
you know, I just feel a bit off? Or--

07:02.088 --> 07:04.799
Um, you know,
do you guys feel strange at all?

07:04.882 --> 07:07.093
Strange? No. Not us.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.010
Nope.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.099
Okay. Hey, I made hot dogs.
You guys hungry?

07:13.182 --> 07:14.725
-Hot dogs? Woof!
-Bark!

07:14.809 --> 07:15.726
Meow.

07:27.697 --> 07:28.865
Here we come, Fink.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.617
The wisters need answers!

07:36.747 --> 07:38.416
-Auf Wiedersehen!
-Sayonara!

07:38.499 --> 07:39.500
Au revoir!

07:39.584 --> 07:41.878
Peace out.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.754
Uh, peace out.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.548
Hey, oh, I get it!

07:45.631 --> 07:48.718
Yeah, it's one of those joke days.
Right, girls, I'll play along.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.430
Oh, okay.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.933
-Pumpkin patch!
-Pumpkin patch!

07:56.017 --> 07:57.602
I like chicken fingers.

07:58.102 --> 08:00.730
-Bike! I'll drive!
-I'll take front.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.649
-I'll take back.
-Beep beep! Beep!

08:04.400 --> 08:06.152
Beep! Beep!

08:06.235 --> 08:08.112
-You guys want a lift?
-Lift!

08:08.196 --> 08:11.949
-Lift! Lift! Lift! Lift!

08:19.290 --> 08:21.918
Wyatt. Catch them.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.545
We'll get the dad,
you get Willa and her friends,

08:24.629 --> 08:27.340
and you keep them in one spot.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.343
Don't fail us again.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.935
I don't know. I give him a 50-50 chance.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.728
-That's generous.
-Mm-hm.

08:43.105 --> 08:45.066
Whoa.

08:45.149 --> 08:49.237
Did this place get even creepier
than the last time we were here?

08:50.071 --> 08:51.614
Or is that just me?

08:52.114 --> 08:54.033
I don't think it's just you,

08:54.116 --> 08:56.536
but good thing we're brave, right?

08:56.619 --> 08:58.829
Let's get this over with. Come on.

09:06.462 --> 09:07.296
Mm.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.923
-Beep.
-Mm.

09:09.423 --> 09:12.343
-Mm. Mep.
-Beep. Beep.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.637
-Mep.
-Beep.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.099
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

09:18.182 --> 09:19.350
Mep.

09:19.934 --> 09:20.768
Okay.

09:21.519 --> 09:24.146
Girls, can I talk to you for a minute?
A moment? A second?

09:25.773 --> 09:28.067
-Oof.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.070
-Oh…
-That's a rake.

09:33.489 --> 09:39.579
Now, girls, there is a fine line
between fun and chaos.

09:40.162 --> 09:43.541
Part of me worries
that you're not taking this seriously.

09:45.001 --> 09:50.047
Can I count on you three
to be as focused as I am?

09:52.383 --> 09:54.051
I'm gonna interpret that as a yes.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.641
Okay, good talk.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.101
Watch the rake.

10:02.184 --> 10:04.478
-Whoa…

10:07.648 --> 10:12.278
What in the name of moldy mildew?

10:12.361 --> 10:13.362
Candy!

10:13.446 --> 10:17.408
Of all the things he could sell
in his store, he had to sell candy.

10:17.491 --> 10:18.659
Classic Neil.

10:18.743 --> 10:22.455
As long as the candy doesn't touch us,
we'll be safe.

10:23.581 --> 10:27.209
Aha! And that, my friend,

10:27.293 --> 10:29.128
is just the ticket.

10:29.211 --> 10:31.297
-A furniture store. Yes!
-Mm!

10:31.380 --> 10:33.758
-Why?
-Okay, let's just go.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.849
We can do this.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.769
I'm totally not terrified right now.

10:45.269 --> 10:48.064
-Looking for something?

10:48.147 --> 10:49.357
-Oh no!

10:49.440 --> 10:52.193
Here to hand over the amulet?

10:52.985 --> 10:55.988
I knew you'd finally come to your senses.

10:56.572 --> 11:00.034
We don't want any trouble.
We're here for the rat.

11:00.117 --> 11:03.829
Oh, no time for milk and sardines?

11:04.413 --> 11:06.082
Don't get in our way!

11:06.749 --> 11:09.919
Do you really think
you can take on three humans?

11:10.002 --> 11:12.880
Oh, yes. That.

11:14.715 --> 11:19.595
A little rhyme to charm with style
Keep those feline forms a while

11:19.678 --> 11:21.555
Take away their magic hands

11:21.639 --> 11:24.600
Make them simple cats, so bland

11:28.521 --> 11:30.106
What did you do to us?

11:30.689 --> 11:33.401
Just leveled the playing field a bit.

11:33.484 --> 11:36.153
Return the forms that we came from!

11:38.614 --> 11:40.491
Why isn't it working?

11:40.574 --> 11:42.326
We should be turning back!

11:42.410 --> 11:45.579
Oh, you're gonna love this next one!

11:45.663 --> 11:50.876
A better form than bird or dog
Make this cat a spiky hog

11:54.255 --> 11:55.756
Run!

11:58.384 --> 12:02.263
Oh, this is getting fun!

12:02.346 --> 12:05.224
Can't a rat take a nap?
What's all the commotion?

12:05.307 --> 12:06.725
Why are you a porcupine?

12:06.809 --> 12:12.898
Oh, just a little game with our intruders,
and the amulet is the prize.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.109
-The amulet?

12:15.192 --> 12:16.026
Uh-oh.

12:26.412 --> 12:30.207
Strike! Oh! Oh!

12:30.291 --> 12:33.085
Stee-rike! Stee-rike! Stee-rike!

12:33.169 --> 12:34.295
-Strike!
-Strike!

12:34.378 --> 12:35.588
-Strike!
-Strike!

12:35.671 --> 12:37.298
Strike! Strike!

12:37.381 --> 12:40.759
Okay, the annual Pumpkin Bowl begins now!

12:40.843 --> 12:42.470
-Yeah!

12:42.553 --> 12:45.806
-Now!
-Yes, now! That's you, girls, so…

12:48.184 --> 12:51.604
Your job is to reset the targets
between each round,

12:52.188 --> 12:55.024
you know, like making
the pins come back to life.

12:56.692 --> 12:59.653
They're going to come flying
fast and furious, so go!

12:59.737 --> 13:01.739
Go!

13:06.410 --> 13:08.787
-Make the pins come to life!

13:08.871 --> 13:11.123
Make the pins come to life!

13:13.083 --> 13:17.505
Willa, you are a witch.
Make the pins come to life.

13:17.588 --> 13:18.464
Okay!

13:18.547 --> 13:22.635
Now it's time to come to life
Dance and chase and give a fright

13:22.718 --> 13:25.721
-Abracadabra!

13:28.015 --> 13:29.183
Hey, um, Willa,

13:29.266 --> 13:32.436
I've been trying to find
a chance to talk to you all day.

13:32.520 --> 13:36.982
Uh, there's something really cool I need
to show you inside the barn over there.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.067
Follow me.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.027
-Yah!

13:40.110 --> 13:42.363
Follow you!

13:42.947 --> 13:45.658
-What the--

13:53.249 --> 13:54.458
-Good luck!
-Bye!

13:59.505 --> 14:01.715
-Come on in. Welcome.
-Oh, hello!

14:01.799 --> 14:02.633
Hi!

14:02.716 --> 14:06.095
You are in luck!
We're giving away free samples today.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.347
-Ooh!
-Interest you in a raspberry gobwhopper?

14:09.473 --> 14:10.599
Sorry!

14:11.183 --> 14:12.393
She's diabetic!

14:12.476 --> 14:15.437
Oh! Well, we've got
plenty of sugar-free candy as well.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.815
Can I take your… coats?

14:17.898 --> 14:19.608
-No. No.
-No. Nuh-uh.

14:21.110 --> 14:24.029
Uh-huh. Well, have a look around,
there's lots of tasty treats,

14:24.113 --> 14:26.323
and just let me know
if you need anything at all.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.034
-Let's get him!

14:29.118 --> 14:31.787
-Have we met before?

14:31.871 --> 14:34.915
You look so familiar…

14:34.999 --> 14:36.667
Ah! It's probably just déjà vu.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.796
My memory's been
kind of foggy lately.

14:41.672 --> 14:42.673
-Oh.

14:44.133 --> 14:47.177
-Hey, come on in! How are you?
-Can I have some candy?

14:47.261 --> 14:48.470
Isn't it your birthday?

14:48.554 --> 14:50.973
Right, well,
I got something special for you…

14:51.056 --> 14:52.182
Yeah, yeah.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.560
-I think this is gonna take a while.
-Okay.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.730
You little brats!

14:57.813 --> 15:00.733
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

15:01.400 --> 15:03.611
This is not going like I planned!

15:03.694 --> 15:06.363
I knew we shouldn't have
trusted that rodent!

15:06.447 --> 15:08.198
We can't hide forever!

15:08.866 --> 15:11.243
There's three of us and only one of her.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.246
Is it too late to go back
and just jump in the portal?

15:14.330 --> 15:17.082
That feels like
the better option at this point.

15:18.167 --> 15:22.588
I got it! If we can't use our magic,
we'll use hers!

15:22.671 --> 15:23.923
-Huh?
-What?

15:24.006 --> 15:25.382
Follow my lead.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.596
-Bowling pin!
-Reset!

15:30.679 --> 15:32.264
-Bowling pin!
-Reset!

15:32.348 --> 15:35.392
Girls, that scarecrow that just went by…

15:37.853 --> 15:39.146
Is everything okay?

15:39.229 --> 15:42.232
A-okay, Miss Junipay!

15:43.734 --> 15:44.735
Right.

15:45.402 --> 15:49.114
Um, Willa, have you
talked to your dad yet?

15:49.198 --> 15:53.410
Because before you start messing around
with any more magic, you really need--

15:55.329 --> 15:57.247
-Hi!
-Hi!

15:58.499 --> 16:02.753
Oh no, no, no, that's not okay!
That's not supposed to be happening!

16:03.295 --> 16:05.547
Girls, that scarecrow is alive!

16:07.633 --> 16:09.635
What did you do?!

16:09.718 --> 16:13.722
-What did you do?

16:17.184 --> 16:19.103
Okay, you guys know the plan.

16:19.186 --> 16:21.647
I sure hope this works.

16:21.730 --> 16:25.317
Sneak! Come find us!

16:25.818 --> 16:29.279
We're downstairs! We give up!

16:29.863 --> 16:32.574
Come and get us, you spiky weirdo!

16:34.952 --> 16:37.705
Giving up so soon?

16:37.788 --> 16:41.959
Oh no! Don't cast a spell on us! Please!

16:42.042 --> 16:45.045
The running is over
You're locked at the knees

16:45.129 --> 16:49.216
One look in my eyes
And now you will freeze!

16:49.299 --> 16:50.592
Lucy, now!

16:53.887 --> 16:54.763
No!

16:59.184 --> 17:00.978
-It worked!
-We did it!

17:02.855 --> 17:05.399
How do you like
the taste of your own medicine?

17:05.983 --> 17:08.235
What are you doing here?

17:08.819 --> 17:11.071
We have some questions for you, Fink.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.991
For starters,
we want to know what's going on.

17:14.074 --> 17:16.285
What's with the portal? Where does it go?

17:16.869 --> 17:19.955
Ooh, boy. I really hope
she can't hear us right now.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.582
Look, you need help,

17:21.665 --> 17:24.168
and the best person to help
is through that portal,

17:24.251 --> 17:27.212
but it's the witches
you should be worried about right now.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.380
They're after your dad!

17:28.464 --> 17:29.673
What?

17:30.257 --> 17:32.176
What do you mean, "after my dad"?

17:32.259 --> 17:35.971
If they could have taken the amulet,
they would have by now,

17:36.055 --> 17:39.433
which means they need
something they can trade for it!

17:39.516 --> 17:42.227
-Something like--
-Mr. Ward!

17:42.311 --> 17:43.228
Oh no!

17:43.312 --> 17:47.608
Okay, new plan: save my dad now
and investigate the portal tomorrow.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.777
Do you know how
we can reverse Sneak's spell?

17:49.860 --> 17:52.613
Potion room, third shelf,
human brew. Hurry!

17:53.530 --> 17:56.116
But… why are you helping us?

17:56.200 --> 17:57.117
Just go!

17:57.201 --> 17:59.244
You still might be able to stop them!

18:01.288 --> 18:03.248
Hurry, hurry! Do you see it?

18:03.332 --> 18:06.960
Potions, potions, ropes to snakes…

18:07.544 --> 18:09.922
Where is it? Hm…

18:10.005 --> 18:11.673
Human brew! I got it!

18:12.257 --> 18:13.258
Yes!

18:13.342 --> 18:14.635
Here it comes!

18:24.770 --> 18:25.771
Quick!

18:27.231 --> 18:29.316
Bye, customers!

18:36.031 --> 18:38.617
Are you sure I can't help
you ladies find something?

18:38.700 --> 18:41.912
-No thanks, Normal Neil.
-No thanks.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.997
-Normal Neil?

18:47.751 --> 18:49.586
Normal Neil!

18:49.670 --> 18:53.799
Normal Neil! Normal Neil!

18:53.882 --> 18:55.968
You! Witches!

18:57.845 --> 18:59.763
Help! Somebody help! Witches! Witches!

18:59.847 --> 19:04.768
Licorice candy rope unwind
Tie up Neil in a bind!

19:07.604 --> 19:12.067
Girls, psst, come on! Girls!
I got rid of that creepy scarecrow thing.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.570
What is up with that, anyway?

19:15.404 --> 19:18.907
Well, remember that really cool thing
I wanted to show you guys?

19:18.991 --> 19:20.200
It's in here! Come on.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.913
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

19:24.997 --> 19:26.790
-Cool!

19:28.750 --> 19:31.461
-Aha! Sit tight, ladies!

19:31.545 --> 19:34.464
-Okay! That sounds mega-good!

19:38.093 --> 19:38.969
-Boo!

19:43.557 --> 19:45.017
-No, no, no!

19:45.601 --> 19:48.854
-We have to get to the candy shop!
-Okay, doppels then candy shop.

19:48.937 --> 19:51.815
Willa Ward, you fix this right now!

19:51.899 --> 19:55.152
-You're ruining the Pumpkin Bowl!
-Run! Help me!

19:55.235 --> 19:56.778
-Oh, no.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.615
You cannot bring scarecrows to life!

20:00.657 --> 20:03.744
If you do not tell your father
right now that you are a witch,

20:03.827 --> 20:05.662
then I will tell him for you!

20:05.746 --> 20:09.208
Oh no! Doppel-Willa must have
figured out she can do magic too.

20:09.291 --> 20:12.419
We have to find
our doppelgangers, and fast.

20:12.502 --> 20:16.506
-Wait, listen. Is that… us?

20:26.183 --> 20:29.019
Doppelgangers be gone
With a swish of my arm

20:29.102 --> 20:31.688
Begone from the streets
Begone from this farm!

20:34.399 --> 20:35.275
Whew!

20:35.776 --> 20:37.819
-Come on!

20:39.821 --> 20:42.991
Wow, Normal Neil, you're even boring
when you're held captive.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.953
-Dad!
-Oh, ho, ho, ho!

20:46.036 --> 20:49.831
Oh, did you mean this boring dad
over here tied up to this chair?

20:49.915 --> 20:53.252
-Take that!
-Oh, no!

20:53.335 --> 20:54.544
Yeah, sorry kids,

20:54.628 --> 20:58.340
that won't work anymore,
because we have protective clothing.

21:02.552 --> 21:03.845
What he's trying to say is,

21:03.929 --> 21:06.932
give the big bad witches
the amulet, Willa.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.226
-Willa, no! You can't!

21:09.309 --> 21:12.980
Aunt Wilma, I got
the three of them trapped in a barn!

21:13.855 --> 21:14.690
Wyatt?

21:16.316 --> 21:18.235
Wh-- How did you three get out?

21:18.318 --> 21:21.571
You are the warlock that's been after us?

21:21.655 --> 21:23.699
-Surprise!

21:24.408 --> 21:25.492
Willa.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.828
The amulet or your dad.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.248
Now!

21:35.294 --> 21:37.671
-No! Willa, you can't!

21:37.754 --> 21:40.590
Oh, did you want your daddy here
to just vanish into thin air?

21:42.718 --> 21:43.844
-No!

21:43.927 --> 21:44.761
Mm.

21:45.345 --> 21:47.306
Then hand it over!

21:52.644 --> 21:53.854
There it is!

21:56.565 --> 22:01.320
And now we will, uh, take care of
you three meddling kids and get--

22:01.403 --> 22:02.946
-What?
-I thought we had a deal!

22:03.530 --> 22:04.823
A deal with witches?

22:04.906 --> 22:07.326
What are you, 12?

22:07.409 --> 22:09.953
Actually, they are 12.
I think that's about their age.

22:10.037 --> 22:13.415
You know what? This is getting boring.
Uh, we'll take care of you later.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.500
-See you soon!

22:18.879 --> 22:20.589
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.215
It's okay, sweetheart!

22:22.799 --> 22:25.761
-It's okay. It's okay.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.598
No, it's not okay.

22:30.432 --> 22:33.060
-The amulet's gone.
