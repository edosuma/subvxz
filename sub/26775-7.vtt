"It is with grief
that the news is received

00:04.880 --> 00:09.749
"of the deaths by fire of
James MacKenzie Fraser and his wife."

00:10.130 --> 00:13.042
They received the land in 1768.

00:13.180 --> 00:18.004
50, that means some time
in the next 12 years, they die.

00:18.100 --> 00:22.059
Hello, this is Roger Wakefield.
May I speak with Brianna Randall?

00:22.140 --> 00:23.129
She went to Scot/and.

00:23.230 --> 00:24.390
To Scotland? Why?

00:24.520 --> 00:25.646
To visit her mother.

00:25.730 --> 00:26.719
How long ago?

00:26.820 --> 00:28.469
A couple of weeks ago.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.356
Thought you two would have
seen each other by now.

00:30.610 --> 00:33.738
She asked me to wait a year
before sending it to ye.

00:34.240 --> 00:36.868
Roger, .7 found out
something ternb/e

00:36.950 --> 00:38.781
is going to happen
to my mother and Jamie.

00:39.580 --> 00:44.028
If I didn ’t try to go and help them,
I would never have forgiven myse/ﬁ

00:44.120 --> 00:46.076
Goodbye, Roger.

00:47.670 --> 00:50.127
Sing me a song

00:50.210 --> 00:52.917
Of a /ass that is gone

00:53.170 --> 00:56.173
Say, could that /ass

00:56.260 --> 00:57.887
Be 1'?

00:58.680 --> 01:00.807
Merry of soul

01:00.890 --> 01:04.053
She salied on a day

01:04.140 --> 01:06.096
Over the sea

01:06.190 --> 01:08.647
7'0 Skye

01:09.270 --> 01:11.852
[Wow and breeze

01:11.940 --> 01:14.317
Islands and seas

01:14.400 --> 01:18.769
Mountains of rain and sun

01:19.740 --> 01:22.288
All that was good

01:22.370 --> 01:24.907
All that was fair

01:25.000 --> 01:27.537
All that was me

01:27.630 --> 01:29.780
Is gone

01:29.880 --> 01:32.201
Sing me a song

01:32.300 --> 01:35.212
Of a lass that is gone

01:35.300 --> 01:37.586
Say, could that lass

01:37.680 --> 01:39.250
Be 1'?

01:40.640 --> 01:42.710
Merry of soul

Over the sea

7'0 Skye

06:13.370 --> 06:18.319
"Time is not a reality,
but a concept, or a measure."

06:19.710 --> 06:22.372
So says
the Greek orator, Antiphon.

06:26.300 --> 06:27.289
Well, for yer sake,

06:29.050 --> 06:31.883
I hope that time travel is a reality,

06:32.510 --> 06:35.092
otherwise, you'll have
shaved your beard for nothing.

06:36.350 --> 06:38.261
D'ye have everything?

06:38.350 --> 06:39.339
Aye.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.684
Money, map, compass, knife...

06:44.820 --> 06:46.890
Gemstone.

07:11.050 --> 07:13.757
Do you hear that?

07:13.850 --> 07:16.808
The stones dinna call to me.

10:53.730 --> 10:56.858
It's all right, sweetheart.
We are home, now.

10:56.940 --> 10:58.350
-Mmm.
- There we go.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.320
Lass?

11:12.960 --> 11:14.040
Where am I?

11:15.460 --> 11:17.337
You're in my home.

11:17.420 --> 11:19.468
You were lying in the moss, cold as ice.

11:19.550 --> 11:21.927
We had no choice
but to bring ye home wi' us.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.636
Oh, here.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.511
I've brought ye some morsels to eat.

11:30.940 --> 11:31.929
Thank you.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.441
This is the best chicken
I've ever tasted.

11:39.530 --> 11:41.942
If only.

11:42.030 --> 11:45.818
Thank ye. 'Tis roasted pigeon.

11:49.330 --> 11:52.663
It's not prepared this way in England.

11:52.750 --> 11:54.126
Oh, you've come from England?

11:54.630 --> 11:56.586
You've an unusual accent.

11:57.090 --> 11:58.409
And you're all alone?

11:59.760 --> 12:02.888
I'm trying to reach Ayr Harbor.

12:03.510 --> 12:06.001
My parents are in the Americas.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.670
I'm going to meet them there.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.801
Marsali's in North Carolina.

12:09.890 --> 12:10.936
My eldest daughter.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.226
She's marrit, now.

12:14.310 --> 12:15.470
To a frog!

12:15.860 --> 12:18.021
Aye, he is at that,

12:18.110 --> 12:20.487
but he's also
the father of my grandchild.

12:25.660 --> 12:28.322
You're a fair way
from any harbour I know of, lass.

12:28.410 --> 12:30.321
Were ye truly of a mind
to walk by yerself?

12:33.120 --> 12:36.999
I, um, was hoping to catch a ride
with someone on the road.

12:43.340 --> 12:47.800
I'm Laoghaire,
and this is my daughter, Joanie.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.671
Oh, Brianna.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.431
Dinna fash, Brianna.

12:53.520 --> 12:54.760
Ye may stay as long as ye need.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.858
Have some rest, now.

13:12.710 --> 13:13.995
A good evening to you, Mistress.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.411
I was expecting ye earlier.

13:16.210 --> 13:18.166
Aye, I was detained.

13:18.250 --> 13:20.662
Ye best have good news for me
tonight, Ian Murray.

13:20.750 --> 13:22.752
I cannae take much more of this.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.212
I ken it's not _
what you're expecting.

13:30.220 --> 13:31.551
It's not half of what he owes me.

13:31.890 --> 13:33.676
I beg you
to be reasonable, Mistress.

13:33.770 --> 13:35.681
You'll have your money
as soon as he's able to send it.

13:35.770 --> 13:37.931
- He's an honourable man.
- "Honourable"?

13:38.020 --> 13:40.261
Is it honourable to commit bigamy, then?

13:40.360 --> 13:41.645
Desert his wife and children?

13:41.730 --> 13:43.607
You really dis/Ike me that much?

13:43.690 --> 13:46.568
It's my graduation
for God's sake, Frank.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.946
_ You humiliated me
In front of my new colleagues.

13:49.030 --> 13:50.691
Well, welcome to the club.

13:50.780 --> 13:52.031
What the hell does that mean?

13:52.120 --> 13:54.247
Keep your voice down.
You'll wake Brianna.

13:54.330 --> 13:55.911
What does that mean?

13:56.000 --> 13:59.208
It means you're not as good
an actress as you think you are, Claire.

13:59.290 --> 14:01.201
You knew how important today was to me.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.006
- I beg you to be reasonable.
- "Reasonable"?

14:03.090 --> 14:05.411
I've been living in drag,
eating nothing but scraps.

14:05.510 --> 14:07.671
It's not right.
He promised more than this.

14:07.760 --> 14:10.137
Mistress,
he's doing the best that he can.

14:10.220 --> 14:12.097
If you'd only give him
a bit more time...

14:12.180 --> 14:13.465
I married him in good faith,

14:13.560 --> 14:16.347
and he promised me payment
for the wrong he did to me,

14:16.440 --> 14:19.682
running away with that besom
and leaving me here to rot.

14:19.770 --> 14:21.761
Laoghaire,
you ken he's a man of his word.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.350
If he had more, he'd send more.

14:23.440 --> 14:26.603
I'm tired of his excuses.
We cannae eat excuses.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.406
We're in need of the money.

14:32.740 --> 14:34.116
Who's the lass?

14:34.200 --> 14:35.656
A traveller I took in.

14:36.160 --> 14:39.493
Pitiful sight she was, cold and weary,
could barely stand on her feet.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.951
Apologies, lass.
I didna mean to awaken ye.

14:43.170 --> 14:45.081
No, I'm sorry to interrupt.

14:45.630 --> 14:46.619
An outlander?

14:47.420 --> 14:49.638
Look, it's nae bother.

14:50.300 --> 14:53.133
Ye need rest. Have another lie down.

15:05.070 --> 15:08.813
We dinna want to see ye
goin' without. Take this for now.

15:09.410 --> 15:11.867
Oh, no, no.
I'll no take a penny from you.

15:11.950 --> 15:13.326
I want his money.

15:13.910 --> 15:15.366
I still have my pride.

15:44.940 --> 15:46.896
Good morning.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.062
Oh, good morning to you, lass.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.526
Keeps the garden lookin' neat.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.942
Though, if I'd kent
I was to have a visitor, I'd have...

16:00.210 --> 16:02.326
I hope you'll forgive
the intrusion yesterday.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.286
What? No, it's me who's intruding.

16:07.170 --> 16:10.048
You've been so kind.

16:10.130 --> 16:14.965
You must have thought me uncouth,
to be in my parlour, arguin' with a man.

16:16.220 --> 16:17.710
Is he your husband?

16:19.060 --> 16:20.800
Oh, no.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.846
No, a... A messenger only.

16:24.770 --> 16:27.182
Comes bearin' ill tidings each month.

16:28.690 --> 16:31.397
Kin of my former husband.

16:31.490 --> 16:35.403
Comes to remind me that _
the money I am owed wrlna be paId.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.980
Sorry. That must be difficult.

16:39.200 --> 16:42.158
Times are hard, I wilna lie.

16:43.790 --> 16:46.953
The dress fits you well.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.794
You're nearly the same size
as my Marsali.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.872
Wi' yer own garment all in tatters
and not fit to keep ye warm,

16:54.510 --> 16:56.751
something woollen
will serve you much better

16:56.850 --> 16:57.965
for yer voyage at sea.

16:58.060 --> 17:00.346
Thank you.

17:00.430 --> 17:03.228
I hope someone
would do the same for my girls.

17:04.770 --> 17:07.147
'Tis flattering indeed.
Is it no, Joanie?

17:07.230 --> 17:09.937
Soon, you'll be grown enough
for a dress such as this,

17:10.030 --> 17:12.146
and leave me to get married, no doubt.

17:12.610 --> 17:14.521
Will ye help me with the garden?

17:15.240 --> 17:17.481
Now, there's a thought.

17:17.620 --> 17:20.692
I'll put on some stew.

17:45.270 --> 17:48.603
Is it your father
who doesn't send the money?

17:48.690 --> 17:49.725
My da?

17:50.020 --> 17:51.009
Aye.

17:52.740 --> 17:57.188
I call him "Da," but my own father
left when I was wee.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.111
I dinna remember him.

18:06.670 --> 18:08.706
Do you ever put flowers in your hair?

18:08.790 --> 18:11.293
No, not this time 0' year.

18:11.380 --> 18:15.089
Here. I'll do it for you.

18:20.760 --> 18:23.923
It's such a beautiful colour.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.009
Like yours.

18:27.140 --> 18:30.439
I'm told it's like my father's,

18:30.520 --> 18:32.476
though I've never met him.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.686
Ma says that men are louts.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.270
Do ye ken if he's a lout?

18:37.990 --> 18:40.276
I don't know.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.656
I don't think he is.

18:42.790 --> 18:45.327
I hope to find out for myself one day.

18:47.330 --> 18:50.993
Is it your da she thinks is a lout?

18:51.080 --> 18:56.256
He was good and kind to me always,
but he broke Ma's heart.

18:56.340 --> 18:58.581
He didna love her as she loved him.

19:02.180 --> 19:06.514
I could say the same
about the man who raised me.

19:06.600 --> 19:09.933
My mother didn't love him
the same way in return.

19:15.900 --> 19:16.980
It's open.

19:18.610 --> 19:20.316
Why aren't you answering the phone?

19:20.490 --> 19:23.027
Are you going to stay
at the office all night?

19:23.120 --> 19:24.485
What is going on with you?

19:38.340 --> 19:39.967
What's this?

19:42.970 --> 19:46.633
That is research
from a colleague In Scotland.

19:47.270 --> 19:50.137
Take a look.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.599
Who died?

19:57.530 --> 19:58.519
Um...

19:59.700 --> 20:01.065
It's complicated.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.736
Well, do you wanna talk about it?

20:07.620 --> 20:11.909
I mean, "complicated"
is a relative term, Daddy.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.740
It all depends on your perspective.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.291
My daughter, the psychiatrist.

20:21.380 --> 20:22.756
So, Professor Randall...

20:23.970 --> 20:26.757
It seems you've been
working very hard lately.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.340
You could say that.

20:28.430 --> 20:30.136
And your research is...

20:30.640 --> 20:32.221
Mmm, let me think.

20:32.310 --> 20:36.053
What term would Freud use?

20:37.440 --> 20:38.646
"Going nowhere"?

20:44.570 --> 20:48.688
Yep, you could say that, too.

20:49.700 --> 20:52.453
Well, that doesn't
sound like you, Daddy.

20:52.540 --> 20:53.529
What is it?

21:02.720 --> 21:03.709
Um...

21:11.810 --> 21:14.301
Daddy, it's me. You can tell me.

21:41.920 --> 21:42.909
Bree...

21:57.480 --> 21:59.016
I'm sorry.

22:00.230 --> 22:02.687
I'm sorry. I can't. I...

22:03.400 --> 22:05.698
It... It's obviously important to you.

22:07.030 --> 22:08.019
Yeah.

22:11.330 --> 22:15.448
It was everything to me, aside from you.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.661
And Mama?

22:21.500 --> 22:23.127
You should go home.

22:24.340 --> 22:25.466
She'll be worried about you.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.045
She'll be fine.

22:29.390 --> 22:32.177
Go home, Brianna. Please.

22:35.890 --> 22:37.687
Go home.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.982
Bnanna?

22:46.450 --> 22:49.567
Someday, I promise, you'll understand.

22:50.240 --> 22:53.232
Maybe someday, I won't care.

23:15.140 --> 23:16.209
Come in.

23:20.730 --> 23:23.642
Your bed should be warm by now.

23:33.830 --> 23:39.325
My nest here
will be empty before too long.

23:40.250 --> 23:44.334
'Course, I hope Joanie
will marry, in time.

23:44.460 --> 23:47.042
To a good man, if there is such a thing.

23:47.800 --> 23:49.836
She's seen them come and go.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.886
There are good men.

23:53.970 --> 23:57.519
And she's a lovely girl.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.841
I'm sure when the time's right,

23:59.940 --> 24:02.090
she'll find a man
who'll do anything for her.

24:03.150 --> 24:07.029
Well, as her ma,
I'd do anything for her.

24:07.110 --> 24:11.319
But a husband? Hard to be sure.

24:14.660 --> 24:19.825
There was a time when my last husband
would ha' done anythin' for me.

24:22.250 --> 24:24.491
When I was a young lass,
he took a beating for me.

24:26.380 --> 24:29.838
And he would steal kisses from me
whenever he had the chance.

24:32.130 --> 24:33.336
He loved me once,

24:35.260 --> 24:37.387
until he was bewitched by another woman.

24:41.430 --> 24:44.149
'Tis her fault his heart
hardened against me.

24:46.570 --> 24:47.605
I'm sorry.

24:48.570 --> 24:51.642
Aye, ye've nothin'
to be sorry for, lass.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.696
Though, I do miss him.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.407
I know the pain of missing someone.

25:00.410 --> 25:02.150
We were a family.

25:03.250 --> 25:07.584
Come nightfall,
we would sit together around the fire,

25:07.710 --> 25:11.339
Joanie on his knee
and Marsali at his side,

25:11.420 --> 25:15.379
and he and I would tell a tale
or two from the Bible.

25:16.260 --> 25:19.844
There was so much joy then.

25:19.930 --> 25:23.809
Since he left us,
I cannae bring myself to recite them.

25:23.890 --> 25:27.053
It pains Joanie.

25:33.990 --> 25:35.901
What was Joanie's favourite story?

25:37.410 --> 25:40.288
Oh, she loved the story
of Naomi and Ruth.

25:48.250 --> 25:49.786
Would you tell it to me?

25:59.220 --> 26:03.099
In the days when the judges ruled,

26:03.180 --> 26:05.228
there was a famine in the land.

26:06.100 --> 26:11.390
And so, a man from Bethlehem in Judah,

26:11.480 --> 26:15.894
along with his wife and two sons...

26:19.320 --> 26:23.154
Went to live for a while
In the country of Moab.

26:23.750 --> 26:28.915
The man's name was Elimelek.
HIS wrfe's name was Naomi.

26:42.930 --> 26:44.136
He's over there.

26:45.310 --> 26:46.425
Thank you.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.812
Excuse me. Pardon me.

26:52.900 --> 26:54.640
Are you the captain of the
Gloriana?

26:54.730 --> 26:55.731
Indeed, I am.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.446
I'm seeking passage to the Carolinas.

26:58.530 --> 27:00.862
There's no luck here.

27:00.950 --> 27:04.784
I do intend to sail to Wilmington
on my way to Philadelphia,

27:05.160 --> 27:08.152
but I'm taking no one else aboard.

27:08.250 --> 27:10.320
Sir... Captain, please.

27:10.670 --> 27:11.659
I'd do anything.

27:12.040 --> 27:14.497
My lass is there,
and I need to find her.

27:14.590 --> 27:17.468
And you can't find yourself one here?

27:17.590 --> 27:20.138
There's none so handsome
as an Irish woman, I grant you.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.210
Still, ye'll have to try.

27:23.310 --> 27:26.347
As I've said, taking no one else aboard.

27:26.430 --> 27:27.476
Gentlemen.

27:52.500 --> 27:55.458
Your_h_ands are better suited
to writing letters than saIIIng.

28:11.310 --> 28:12.470
Captain!

28:15.070 --> 28:16.514
Where do you want this?

28:21.950 --> 28:24.441
Do you believe in luck?

28:27.410 --> 28:29.742
Heads, you come. Tails, you stay.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.289
What's your name?

28:40.970 --> 28:42.289
Roger MacKenzie.

28:43.260 --> 28:44.887
Twenty shillings a month, Mr MacKenzie.

28:45.260 --> 28:47.558
You're free to leave the ship
when it's in port,

28:47.640 --> 28:49.676
and you'll be paid
once the cargo's unloaded.

28:50.480 --> 28:53.768
Sailors will show you where to go.

28:57.230 --> 28:58.686
And, MacKenzie?

29:01.110 --> 29:02.896
There's four ports before Wilmington.

29:05.320 --> 29:07.823
I hope she's worth it.

29:20.590 --> 29:21.966
Is yer ankle better?

29:23.430 --> 29:25.000
Almost.

29:25.090 --> 29:27.752
I'll be on my way soon.

29:29.180 --> 29:30.670
Ye've been a blessing, lass.

29:30.770 --> 29:33.978
That cupboard's been broken
since my husband lived here.

29:34.060 --> 29:35.436
I'm happy I could help.

29:37.900 --> 29:39.515
Look at ye!

29:39.610 --> 29:42.682
It's not like you, Joanie,
to keep yer braid for another day.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.481
She's taken a liking to you.

29:47.280 --> 29:50.943
If you ’re going to San Francisco

29:51.410 --> 29:55.198
Be sure to wear .
some ﬂowers In your ha/r

29:55.290 --> 29:56.609
I dinna ken that one.

29:57.290 --> 29:58.837
It's my mother's favourite.

30:00.880 --> 30:04.623
Some of the girls at Lallybroch would
put flowers in their hair in summer.

30:04.720 --> 30:05.709
Lallybroch?

30:06.340 --> 30:08.001
Aye, it's not far from here.

30:08.720 --> 30:10.256
My mother's relatives live there.

30:10.810 --> 30:15.099
I've never met them,
but she always spoke of them so fondly.

30:15.190 --> 30:16.555
And who might yer mother be?

30:16.980 --> 30:18.220
I may have kent her,

30:18.310 --> 30:20.437
spendin' a bit 0' time
at Lallybroch myself.

30:21.110 --> 30:22.099
Claire Fraser.

30:24.570 --> 30:25.605
Do you know her?

30:30.530 --> 30:32.327
Ye never said yer name was Fraser.

30:32.410 --> 30:36.574
It's not. It's "Randall," after Frank,
the man who raised me.

30:39.250 --> 30:40.285
I see.

30:42.590 --> 30:45.753
The husband yer mother didna care for.

30:47.930 --> 30:50.421
I heard you and Joanie speaking
about it in the garden.

30:51.890 --> 30:55.303
She cared for him. She just...

30:55.390 --> 30:57.551
Didna love him
as she loved this other man,

30:58.730 --> 31:00.220
yer true father.

31:07.610 --> 31:09.521
Must be a good man, this Frank Randall,

31:11.450 --> 31:13.657
to have raised a daughter such as ye.

31:15.540 --> 31:19.328
Yes, he was.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.581
Some years ago.

31:24.670 --> 31:26.456
I'm sorry to hear it.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.832
It sounds as though
he'd never leave ye by choice...

31:30.930 --> 31:33.387
Only by God's hand.

32:05.710 --> 32:06.836
Mmm...

32:08.010 --> 32:08.999
You're up early.

32:09.090 --> 32:11.547
I decided a cream tea necessary.

32:17.390 --> 32:18.630
I'm sorry, Daddy.

32:18.730 --> 32:19.799
No.

32:21.520 --> 32:23.852
It's you that deserves an apology.

32:23.940 --> 32:26.181
I was not myself last night.

32:26.270 --> 32:29.103
No. I shouldn't have pushed you.

32:51.590 --> 32:54.548
Nothing that a good cup of tea
and a scone can't fix.

32:58.510 --> 32:59.511
Mmm.

33:04.020 --> 33:05.976
Well? How is it?

33:08.230 --> 33:09.276
It's perfect.

33:16.280 --> 33:17.406
Do you ever...

33:18.950 --> 33:22.534
Have you ever thought
about studying abroad?

33:22.620 --> 33:24.861
I don't know. Why?

33:25.630 --> 33:27.530
There are some excellent universities.

33:27.630 --> 33:29.370
Yeah, I'm sure there are,

33:29.800 --> 33:32.758
but, I mean, Harvard's here,
and you're here.

33:35.760 --> 33:38.172
Do you believe the story
yer mother told you?

33:38.300 --> 33:41.849
About your true father
and why he couldna raise ye?

33:42.100 --> 33:43.306
Of course.

33:43.430 --> 33:47.309
I've no reason to doubt my mother.
Why do you ask?

33:47.400 --> 33:51.769
Well, folks talk at Lallybroch.

33:51.900 --> 33:53.231
'Course,

33:53.320 --> 33:55.527
I wouldna want to repeat what they say,
it bein' about yer father.

33:56.780 --> 33:58.065
What do they say about him?

33:59.410 --> 34:00.900
Nothing.

34:00.990 --> 34:02.946
Forgive me, lass, for speakin' of it.

34:03.040 --> 34:05.531
Please? Tell me.

34:08.210 --> 34:10.087
Well...

34:10.880 --> 34:13.257
I dinna like to repeat
such things myself,

34:14.090 --> 34:16.217
but there are some folk who say

34:17.390 --> 34:20.348
there was no room in his heart
for a barn...

34:21.640 --> 34:25.974
And he sent yer mother away
upon findin' she was with child.

34:26.100 --> 34:30.560
They were married and in love.
Why wouldn't he want a child?

34:31.070 --> 34:33.026
Why wouldn't he want me?

34:33.110 --> 34:35.943
'Tis but whisperings hereabouts.

34:36.030 --> 34:38.567
But I shouldna ha' told ye,

34:38.660 --> 34:40.981
but I didna want ye to hear it
from folk elsewhere.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.149
People gossip.

34:42.240 --> 34:44.538
- Even after all this time?
- Oh, aye.

34:45.080 --> 34:46.707
A tale such as that, why...

34:49.630 --> 34:51.450
Think no more of it, lass.

34:52.380 --> 34:55.964
I only hope he doesna turn ye away
for a second time.

35:02.600 --> 35:05.922
I have to find them,
even if he is what you say.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.016
What is it that's so pressing?

35:14.940 --> 35:16.817
This will sound strange,

35:18.150 --> 35:19.526
but they need my help.

35:19.820 --> 35:22.869
I can prevent their deaths
if I go to them now.

35:22.950 --> 35:24.156
There's going to be a fire.

35:25.290 --> 35:28.282
- How would ye ken such a thing?
- I can't explain it.

35:29.750 --> 35:31.911
If there's something

35:32.000 --> 35:36.118
that will prevent me receiving
my alimony, ye'd best speak of it.

35:36.210 --> 35:37.620
Your alimony?

35:37.720 --> 35:38.869
What does this have to do with you?

35:38.970 --> 35:43.589
How dare you come into my home
and treat me...

35:43.680 --> 35:45.841
How dare you!

35:46.470 --> 35:47.596
You brought me here.

35:47.680 --> 35:49.932
Did they send ye here,
is that what's happened?

35:50.020 --> 35:54.389
Did they send ye here to laugh at me,
or did ye bewitch me yourself?

35:54.480 --> 35:56.220
You're a witch just like yer ma.

35:56.610 --> 35:58.646
- You know my mother?
- I ken her well.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.856
Your mother was the thievin' whore

36:03.570 --> 36:05.367
Your mother is Claire?

36:06.330 --> 36:09.367
Yes, but she never
wanted to leave Jamie...

36:09.460 --> 36:10.745
She went home to another man!

36:11.580 --> 36:15.289
And when he died,
she came back for my Jamie.

36:16.460 --> 36:19.839
Bewitched him, she did, with
a love spell that made me invisible.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.002
She never meant to hurt anyone!

36:22.090 --> 36:24.547
She wouldn't! I'm sorry, I...

36:29.930 --> 36:32.398
I can see I'm no longer welcome.

36:41.860 --> 36:44.772
Claire Fraser should have burned
at the stake in Cranesmuir.

36:45.530 --> 36:46.940
Oh, my God.

36:47.030 --> 36:49.078
You're the one who tried
to have my mother killed.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.867
And she would be dead
if she wasna a witch!

36:51.960 --> 36:54.201
I'm sure believing that
is easier than facing the truth.

36:56.420 --> 36:59.253
And the truth is that Jamie Fraser
has never loved you.

37:02.090 --> 37:03.466
You spawn of a witch.

37:03.550 --> 37:08.214
I'll have you arrested for witchcraft,
just like I did your mother!

37:08.310 --> 37:10.926
Open the door!

37:11.020 --> 37:14.649
Let me out!

37:44.090 --> 37:46.581
That's my dad.

37:51.220 --> 37:52.551
Daddy, what are you doing here?

37:52.640 --> 37:54.722
Sweetheart, I need to talk to you.
Hop in.

37:58.230 --> 37:59.310
Is everything okay?

37:59.400 --> 38:02.187
Do you remember when I mentioned
going to university abroad?

38:02.990 --> 38:03.979
Yeah.

38:04.070 --> 38:06.152
How would you feel about
studying in England?

38:06.240 --> 38:07.275
England?

38:07.370 --> 38:09.076
I've been offered
a position at Cambridge.

38:09.490 --> 38:10.696
I want you to come with me.

38:11.990 --> 38:13.821
And what about Mama?

38:13.910 --> 38:15.400
Is she all right with this?

38:16.670 --> 38:19.161
Your mother and I are getting a divorce.

38:25.470 --> 38:28.792
What are you talking about?
Don't be silly.

38:28.890 --> 38:31.176
- You're too old to get a divorce.
- Bree, listen to me.

38:31.260 --> 38:33.342
No, I... I don't wanna listen to you.

38:33.430 --> 38:34.590
- Darling, please.
- So, what,

38:34.680 --> 38:38.343
you don't always get along. Who does?

38:38.440 --> 38:40.055
But you don't just get divorced.

38:40.400 --> 38:42.937
You love each other.
You can't throw that away.

38:46.450 --> 38:49.692
- We're a family.
- You're my family.

38:49.780 --> 38:52.328
And that will never change,

38:52.450 --> 38:54.907
but your mother and I...

38:57.210 --> 39:00.202
This cannot be
a complete surprise to you.

39:00.290 --> 39:01.450
Well, it is.

39:05.460 --> 39:07.121
So, what, just...

39:07.220 --> 39:10.383
Poof, you're over and I have no say?

39:13.060 --> 39:15.096
Sweetheart, listen to me.

39:15.180 --> 39:19.093
You are _at the centre
of our lives, always.

39:19.190 --> 39:23.513
We both love you very, very much,
and that will never change.

39:23.610 --> 39:26.317
But your mother and I have decided

39:30.280 --> 39:32.862
And you just decided
all of this tonight?

39:34.200 --> 39:36.156
Yes.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.700
It wasn't for want of trying.

39:47.590 --> 39:48.875
I am sorry.

39:50.300 --> 39:52.086
I truly am.

39:54.350 --> 39:55.499
Oh.

39:56.850 --> 39:57.839
Hey.

40:03.440 --> 40:06.273
Come with me.

40:06.360 --> 40:09.147
Will you?

40:15.080 --> 40:17.036
We had a plan.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.327
We were supposed to go
to Harvard together, Daddy.

40:19.410 --> 40:21.241
- I know.
- I'm studying history.

40:21.330 --> 40:22.490
We were gonna share your office and...

40:22.580 --> 40:23.990
I know, I know,

40:24.090 --> 40:28.663
and a thousand years ago,
your mother and I had a plan as well.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.876
But...

40:30.970 --> 40:34.212
You know, sometimes,
life takes unexpected turns,

40:34.300 --> 40:35.927
and when it does...

40:38.100 --> 40:41.513
Do you know what we do?

40:41.600 --> 40:43.648
We soldier on.

40:49.650 --> 40:50.685
How...

40:53.410 --> 40:54.616
I...

40:54.870 --> 40:57.111
I can't... I have to go.

40:57.200 --> 41:00.192
Can we speak later? Bree?

41:01.160 --> 41:02.616
I love you.

41:05.580 --> 41:08.048
I keep thinking,
ifl’d ha ve just stayed

41:08.130 --> 41:10.542
in the car with you that night

41:10.760 --> 41:12.045
you'd still be here.

41:14.220 --> 41:18.919
If I would've just agreed
to go to England with you,

41:19.010 --> 41:20.807
then,

41:21.180 --> 41:25.970
uh, maybe we'd have
gone out to celebrate,

41:27.770 --> 41:31.934
and you never would've had the accident.

41:40.200 --> 41:44.614
But I'm gonna soldier on,

41:44.710 --> 41:47.167
like you said.

41:51.840 --> 41:54.718
You're my hero, Daddy.

42:00.810 --> 42:03.882
Seven herrings are a salmon ’s fill

42:03.980 --> 42:06.642
Seven salmon are a seal ’5 ﬁll

42:06.730 --> 42:09.517
Seven seals are a wha/e’s ﬁll

42:09.610 --> 42:12.352
And seven whales
The fill of a Cirein-cn'n

42:12.440 --> 42:14.567
Do you think there are
any Cirein-crins in the sea?

42:15.110 --> 42:16.987
No.

42:17.070 --> 42:20.574
Sharks, maybe, but no sea monsters.

42:20.660 --> 42:24.289
I told her as much, but the lass,
she doesna listen.

42:24.370 --> 42:25.405
Come on.

42:40.260 --> 42:42.057
Thank ye.

42:45.810 --> 42:47.721
That's the first smile from him in days.

42:48.400 --> 42:50.516
He must like ye.

42:50.610 --> 42:52.259
He's a handsome wee fella.

43:13.050 --> 43:15.416
Oh...

43:15.510 --> 43:18.331
Aren't you a fussy thing?

43:29.060 --> 43:31.802
Shh,shh,shh,shh,shhu.

43:35.030 --> 43:36.395
There.

43:38.070 --> 43:39.526
I thank ye, Captain.

43:41.990 --> 43:43.196
What was that?

43:44.450 --> 43:45.576
Whales.

43:46.250 --> 43:49.788
They scratch themselves against the ship
to rid their skins of barnacles.

43:50.250 --> 43:51.319
Are we in danger?

43:52.170 --> 43:53.990
Only if they have a mind for mischief.

43:54.920 --> 43:56.205
You don't seem troubled by it.

43:57.090 --> 43:59.797
A wise man leaves the things
beyond his power to the gods,

44:00.590 --> 44:02.751
and then he prays that Danu
will be with him.

44:30.910 --> 44:31.956
No!

44:33.710 --> 44:34.870
- No!
- Stay back.

44:34.960 --> 44:36.666
Please don't!

44:36.750 --> 44:38.001
Stay back.

44:38.090 --> 44:40.160
Ye canna do this! I wilna let ye!

44:40.420 --> 44:41.421
What's happened?

44:42.340 --> 44:44.251
The lass has smallpox.

44:44.390 --> 44:46.005
It spreads quick as lightning.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.921
None of us will live to make landfall
if we don't take out the sick.

44:50.770 --> 44:51.930
- Throw her overboard.
- No!

44:52.020 --> 44:53.009
Please, I beg you!

44:53.100 --> 44:54.397
I canna do that. She'll drown.

44:54.480 --> 44:55.469
Please!

44:55.810 --> 44:58.529
You said you were willing
to do whatever I might need.

44:59.320 --> 45:00.730
Do as I command.

45:04.280 --> 45:05.816
Please, I beg you! No!

45:06.120 --> 45:07.189
No!

45:07.700 --> 45:08.940
No! No!

45:09.240 --> 45:11.117
Wait, no! No!

45:11.960 --> 45:13.075
Captain, no!

45:13.170 --> 45:14.785
Let her go!

45:14.880 --> 45:16.336
Captain! Please don't.

45:16.420 --> 45:17.489
Ma...

45:18.090 --> 45:19.751
Christ, have you lost your mind?

45:19.840 --> 45:21.216
I've given five over to the sea already,

45:21.300 --> 45:24.679
and I'll do the same
for any who show signs of a rash.

45:39.150 --> 45:41.641
How could ye?

45:41.740 --> 45:43.640
She was a child, for God's sake!

45:44.820 --> 45:47.698
She was, and of no value.

45:47.780 --> 45:51.364
Aye, no value to you, perhaps.

45:51.450 --> 45:53.498
You will forgive me
for putting my ignorant opinion

45:53.580 --> 45:55.366
above your own, Mr MacKenzie,

45:55.460 --> 45:59.453
but... Well, I'm the captain here.

45:59.550 --> 46:01.950
Continue to examine each passenger.

46:02.050 --> 46:05.338
Anyone who is ill or shows
signs of a rash, bring them to me.

46:08.470 --> 46:11.678
- Come here, you! Show us your face!
- Don't take her!

46:13.810 --> 46:15.471
She's got the rash. Take her.

46:15.560 --> 46:16.800
Stop! Unhand me!

46:16.900 --> 46:18.185
It's nae the pox!

46:18.520 --> 46:20.602
No! Please, no!

46:21.070 --> 46:22.355
Let me see him.

46:22.440 --> 46:24.237
Yeah, you. Come on.

46:24.320 --> 46:27.198
Have ye seen a young mother,
bonny lass with a wee bairn?

46:27.280 --> 46:29.362
- Leave her be.
- No.

46:29.450 --> 46:30.576
Take her!

46:31.830 --> 46:33.536
She's coming with us. Come on, now.

46:33.620 --> 46:35.076
- There you are.
- Please.

46:35.160 --> 46:37.321
I beg you, sir. Ye cannae do it.

46:38.080 --> 46:40.583
I ken where they're takin' us,
ye cannae send him to his death.

46:40.670 --> 46:42.661
I'm not here to hurt your baby.

46:43.840 --> 46:46.832
- Is the child sick?
- It's not but a wee rash.

46:46.930 --> 46:49.672
Jemmy's teeth are comin' in.
Ye saw for yerself.

46:49.760 --> 46:51.341
It's not smallpox.

46:51.430 --> 46:53.716
- You, let's go.
- Lord, have mercy.

46:53.810 --> 46:56.973
If you come with me,
I can help keep you hidden.

46:57.060 --> 46:59.938
I'll get you food and drink.

47:00.440 --> 47:01.816
I dinna ken yer name.

47:02.400 --> 47:03.389
Rogen

47:03.780 --> 47:05.020
Morag MacKenzie.

47:07.360 --> 47:08.349
And this is Jemmy.

47:12.580 --> 47:15.868
- What will ye swear on?
- I'm a MacKenzie as well.

47:19.500 --> 47:21.456
I'll swear on my own woman's life.

47:23.630 --> 47:24.619
This way.

47:58.790 --> 48:01.497
We're here. Lallybroch.

48:13.970 --> 48:16.131
I'm so grateful to you, Joan.

48:16.220 --> 48:17.881
You're a kind soul.

48:17.980 --> 48:20.471
It's not yer fault
yer mother is a witch.

48:21.980 --> 48:23.720
When ye find our da,

48:24.610 --> 48:26.350
mebbe ye'll ask him to come home?

48:28.400 --> 48:30.197
- Joanie?
- Uncle Ian!

48:31.110 --> 48:32.941
What's the traveller doing with ye?

48:34.070 --> 48:36.197
She's Jamie Fraser's daughter.

48:41.250 --> 48:42.740
I believe you, lass.

48:42.830 --> 48:45.492
You dinna need to prove it to me.

48:45.750 --> 48:47.581
Ye have her eyes, ye ken.

48:50.880 --> 48:53.542
I had given up hope
I'd ever look upon a child of Jamie's,

48:53.640 --> 48:58.668
and now, here ye are,
standing right in front of me.

48:59.640 --> 49:01.767
It's a shame my wife's
not here to meet ye.

49:01.850 --> 49:03.260
- Aunt Jenny?
- Aye.

49:03.350 --> 49:05.398
She's away helping birth a grandchild.

49:05.480 --> 49:08.813
I ken she'll have my hide
for no keeping ye here,

49:09.940 --> 49:12.898
but we should have ye on a ship
as soon as we can.

49:15.160 --> 49:19.199
I'm sure Jamie had his reasons
for not telling us.

49:20.540 --> 49:24.579
But I do ken ye're
an unexpected blessing, lass.

49:24.670 --> 49:28.549
This should be enough to buy you
safe passage to North Carolina,

49:28.630 --> 49:30.416
as well as room and board
once you've arrived.

49:30.510 --> 49:33.252
- I can't take your money.
- Aye, ye can.

49:35.260 --> 49:36.249
You're family.

49:39.770 --> 49:41.886
Make sure ye ask
after yer Auntie Jocasta

49:41.980 --> 49:45.188
when ye arrive in Wilmington,
at a place called River Run.

49:45.600 --> 49:48.353
She'll ken where to find yer parents.

49:50.860 --> 49:52.566
Thank you, lads.

49:52.650 --> 49:54.447
Mistress.

49:57.070 --> 49:59.152
The clothes inside
belonged to yer mother.

49:59.240 --> 50:01.447
I ken she'd want ye to have them.

50:23.730 --> 50:25.095
Thank ye, Roger.

50:27.150 --> 50:28.469
Bairn's looking well.

50:28.560 --> 50:30.516
What's wrong?

50:33.190 --> 50:34.737
Captain.

50:35.530 --> 50:37.600
Imagine my surprise

50:37.700 --> 50:41.272
when a galley hand
went lookin' for salt pork,

50:41.450 --> 50:46.149
and found a lassie and a babe instead.

50:46.370 --> 50:48.167
I said a wise man
doesn't trouble himself

50:48.250 --> 50:50.161
with the things beyond his power,

50:52.090 --> 50:55.332
but on this ship,

50:55.420 --> 50:56.751
everything's in my power.

50:57.470 --> 50:58.459
Mmm?

50:59.300 --> 51:02.428
Including the distribution of rations.

51:05.520 --> 51:09.092
Now, see, she's hiding down here,

51:09.190 --> 51:13.183
while others suffer above.

51:17.280 --> 51:19.066
That's not fair, is it?

51:27.790 --> 51:30.418
When I was just 17,

51:30.500 --> 51:33.333
the youngest of a crew of workmen
hired to build a house.

51:34.090 --> 51:36.126
I couldn't say for why they hated me.

51:37.010 --> 51:40.047
They were a whey-faced lot,
so, maybe it was my manner,

51:40.590 --> 51:43.423
or the way the lasses smiled at me.

51:43.510 --> 51:46.013
But I knew I was unpopular with them.

51:46.100 --> 51:47.089
Captain, ifI may...

51:47.180 --> 51:50.934
They needed a sacrifice
for the foundation,

51:51.020 --> 51:54.103
lest the earth should tremble
and the walls collapse.

51:54.940 --> 51:59.274
But they started arguing about
whether I should be the sacrifice,

51:59.360 --> 52:02.113
or if Daft Joey would be
a better choice.

52:03.780 --> 52:06.999
One of the men suggested tossing a coin.

52:08.120 --> 52:09.781
"D'ye take heads or tails?"

52:10.080 --> 52:13.129
he asked, laughing.

52:19.380 --> 52:20.961
I was too sick to speak.

52:22.180 --> 52:24.808
So, he said by Geordie's head,
should I live,

52:24.890 --> 52:27.677
and by his arse, I should die.

52:27.810 --> 52:29.630
And he threw the shilling in the air.

52:32.400 --> 52:35.016
I had no strength to look.

52:36.650 --> 52:40.234
They rolled me on my face and hit me.

52:44.280 --> 52:45.360
When I came to,

52:47.410 --> 52:49.116
I found the shilling in my pocket.

52:49.620 --> 52:51.781
They were honest men, to be sure.

52:55.540 --> 52:58.168
Would you say you were
a gambling man, MacKenzie?

53:07.430 --> 53:08.840
You don't mean
to toss that coin

53:08.930 --> 53:10.477
for Morag and Jemmy's lives?

53:11.060 --> 53:12.436
Oh, not theirs.

53:12.520 --> 53:13.760
No, no, no.

53:13.850 --> 53:16.728
See, you supplied the rations.

53:16.820 --> 53:17.809
You should pay.

53:18.780 --> 53:23.228
A gentleman's wager, shall we call it?
Heads you live, tails you die.

53:34.750 --> 53:35.739
Mmm.

53:39.130 --> 53:41.792
Seems Danu _
was With you tonight, Sll‘.

54:03.280 --> 54:05.407
I do have one request
if ye dinna mind.

54:06.200 --> 54:10.739
My son, Ian, your cousin,
is there wi' yer father.

54:10.830 --> 54:14.402
His mother would be glad
if he wrote more often.

54:16.790 --> 54:19.452
I'll tell him.

54:19.540 --> 54:23.579
Now, are ye sure I cannot
accompany you inside to buy yer passage?

54:23.670 --> 54:25.752
You've done enough for me already.

54:25.840 --> 54:28.798
I shall see to it
that yer trunk is taken aboard.

54:28.890 --> 54:31.051
- Lads?
- Thank you.

54:34.730 --> 54:37.847
Ye have Jamie's fire,
and I dinna just mean his red hair.

54:38.440 --> 54:40.317
Ye're a Fraser through and through.

54:44.240 --> 54:46.526
Thank you, Uncle Ian.

55:00.170 --> 55:01.159
Excuse me, miss?

55:01.960 --> 55:05.259
I'm Joseph Wemyss.
Are ye travellin' alone?

55:05.800 --> 55:08.121
No, my uncle is outside.

55:08.220 --> 55:11.462
Should ye be in need of a servant,
might ye consider my daughter?

55:11.550 --> 55:14.519
She's a fine cook
and a rare hand wi' a needle.

55:14.600 --> 55:17.387
- I have no need of one.
- I beg of you, please.

55:17.480 --> 55:21.393
There is a man who desires her as a...

55:23.860 --> 55:25.020
A concubine.

55:25.610 --> 55:27.521
Then don't let him have her.

55:27.610 --> 55:29.521
I have no choice.

55:29.610 --> 55:32.738
Her contract and mine have been bought

55:32.830 --> 55:35.071
by a broker
who plans to sell her to the man,

55:35.160 --> 55:39.164
unless I find someone else
Willing to secure her passage.

55:40.130 --> 55:42.030
I'm going to North Carolina.

55:42.460 --> 55:46.373
Better she be gone from me forever
to some wild place,

55:46.460 --> 55:48.257
than to be dishonoured.

55:48.470 --> 55:50.631
Please, just... Just meet her.

55:53.220 --> 55:54.801
This is Elizabeth.

55:55.770 --> 55:56.805
Lizzie.

55:58.980 --> 56:00.265
Do your duty to the lady.

56:02.110 --> 56:06.433
Your servant, Mistress.

56:11.030 --> 56:14.329
I'd like to buy passage
on the
Ph/ll/p Alonzo.

56:16.620 --> 56:17.939
For two.

56:20.290 --> 56:22.201
Yer name?

56:22.540 --> 56:25.043
Brianna Randall.

56:51.490 --> 56:54.778
Lizzie!
Be sure to say your prayers!
