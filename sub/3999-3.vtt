WEBVTT

00:18.952 --> 00:21.687
Hey, Nick?
(whispers): Shh, I'm reading.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.989
Can you just give me a second?
What do you want this time?!

00:23.991 --> 00:25.657
So, I'm-I'm pitching
on the sponge account today.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.059
It's kind of a...
it's kind of a big deal.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.527
I'm just wondering why

00:28.529 --> 00:30.295
my idea notebook is covered
in crimson stains.

00:30.297 --> 00:31.697
Oh, that's a fair question.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.265
It's either sloppy Joes,
or it's blood.

00:35.135 --> 00:36.568
(groans)

00:38.872 --> 00:40.539
You unbelievable pig person!

00:40.541 --> 00:43.742
You giant, fat pig
person! You sloth.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.744
You should be living in a tree
in Costa Rica, you know that?

00:45.746 --> 00:47.813
Hi, guys. Um, have either of you
seen the French press?

00:47.815 --> 00:49.314
The French press is
in cupboard 64B.

00:49.316 --> 00:50.916
Did you not consult
your item map?

00:50.918 --> 00:53.085
Oh, no, I looked there.
The tagine's in 64B.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.754
What is the tagine doing
in 64 frickin' B?!

00:55.756 --> 00:57.322
I used the French press.

00:57.324 --> 00:59.058
Everybody chill out.
So it's in here somewhere.

00:59.060 --> 01:00.993
Nick, you know you're not
allowed to use the French press.

01:00.995 --> 01:02.728
I use it to get the pulp
out of my juice.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.063
So just give me one second,
I'll find it.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.764
(chuckles):
Hold on. Oh, yeah.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.933
I wasn't looking for it,
but I found my pulp bowl.

01:07.935 --> 01:10.069
That is a crystal candy bowl
filled with orange goop.

01:10.071 --> 01:12.104
I don't need to sit here
and take this!

01:12.106 --> 01:13.539
I'm going to my study.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.707
You are gonna get back here
and clean your room, mister!

01:15.709 --> 01:17.176
JESS:
Guys, I still need
the French press.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.877
Winston, I need my study corner!

01:18.879 --> 01:21.613
No, not after last time.

01:25.952 --> 01:28.587
Hey, Winnie! You know there's
an Albany in California?
- (yells)

01:28.589 --> 01:32.558
(chuckles): Well,
hello, Winston Bishop.

01:32.560 --> 01:36.061
I towel-burned my unders.
Well, I just prairie-dogged
thanks to you guys.

01:36.063 --> 01:38.864
Stop fighting! Now the
bathroom stinks for no reason.

01:38.866 --> 01:41.066
You happy, Schmidt?
You just scared Coach's poop!

01:41.068 --> 01:44.036
No, I'm not happy. I'm poor, and
I'm living in a filthy thimble.

01:44.038 --> 01:46.105
I've gone from riches to rags.
It's reverse<i> Annie.</i>

01:46.107 --> 01:48.941
Oh, spoiler alert.
Now you just ruined<i> Annie.</i>

01:48.943 --> 01:51.777
(men arguing)

01:51.779 --> 01:52.978
JESS:
Guys, chill out!

01:52.980 --> 01:54.947
Schmidt, your people
have been selling sponges

01:54.949 --> 01:57.149
since the days of Abraham.
You got this.

01:57.151 --> 02:00.119
Nick, the pulp bowl is
real gross. Tighten up.

02:00.121 --> 02:03.255
Most importantly, my dad is
coming with his new girlfriend,

02:03.257 --> 02:05.224
and I need the French press.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.092
Oh, 64B.
- The tagine is in 64B.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.494
64B is occupied!

02:09.729 --> 02:12.164
Uh, he said the tagine
is in 64B.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.399
It stinks in there!
What did you do?!

02:14.401 --> 02:15.734
You kill an animal?!

02:15.736 --> 02:17.803
¶ Who's that girl? ¶

02:17.805 --> 02:21.306
¶<i> Who's that girl?</i> ¶
¶ It's Jess. ¶

02:26.112 --> 02:27.312
How long before you
unleash holy hell

02:27.314 --> 02:29.148
on your dad's
new girlfriend?

02:29.150 --> 02:31.416
I want to make sure I got a
good seat and plenty of snacks.

02:31.418 --> 02:33.785
Okay, Cecilia, look, I know
I've been a little bit hard

02:33.787 --> 02:35.154
on my dad's girlfriends
in the past...

02:35.156 --> 02:37.956
I know you stole my dad's
credit card, Margot.

02:37.958 --> 02:40.259
Hit the damn road.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.260
I don't have a car.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.995
(whispers):
Find one.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.631
I was the one
who had to pick up the pieces

02:45.633 --> 02:46.665
when his heart got broken.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.667
Besides, to hear
my dad talk,

02:48.669 --> 02:51.336
it sounds like he has really
found someone who...

02:51.338 --> 02:53.005
is good for him.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.006
Ha!

02:54.008 --> 02:56.441
And you believe that?

02:56.443 --> 02:58.710
Your dad has terrible taste
in women.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.546
That's why I love him so much.

03:00.548 --> 03:03.015
Remember the one who pretended
to be a paraplegic?

03:03.017 --> 03:04.650
Get up!

03:04.652 --> 03:06.685
I can't!

03:06.687 --> 03:09.321
Oh, whatever.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.622
That's the last one
I met, and I'm lucky

03:10.624 --> 03:11.857
he's letting me
meet this one.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.725
So, what? You're just gonna be
nice to her?

03:13.727 --> 03:15.460
No fireworks? No show?

03:15.462 --> 03:17.663
I'm gonna be nice to her
no matter who she is.

03:17.665 --> 03:18.864
Then what the hell
am I doing here?

03:18.866 --> 03:20.399
(knocking)
Oh.

03:22.235 --> 03:24.336
Hey, sweetie. Hi. Hi.
- Hi, Daddy.

03:24.338 --> 03:26.572
Gee, I'm sorry we're late,

03:26.574 --> 03:28.840
you know, but we saw Seal
at the airport.

03:28.842 --> 03:31.910
We talked to him for 20
minutes, got his autograph.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.512
Wasn't him.
- No.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.347
Anyway, this is Ashley.

03:35.349 --> 03:36.548
Hi.

03:39.686 --> 03:43.889
I think, um, we went
to high school... together.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.257
You went to high school
together!

03:45.259 --> 03:46.558
We went to high
school together!

03:46.560 --> 03:49.494
Julie Berkman's
older sister Ashley?

03:49.496 --> 03:51.663
That's me.
- (Cece laughs)

03:51.665 --> 03:53.932
Is this fun or
what? (laughs)

03:57.237 --> 03:58.570
(whispering):
Oh, my God!

03:58.572 --> 04:01.873
(whispering): Your dad is dating
Trashley Berkman?

04:01.875 --> 04:03.041
Didn't she...?

04:03.043 --> 04:04.943
Yes. She sexually intercoursed

04:04.945 --> 04:06.945
my high school boyfriend George
Jiang underneath the bleachers.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.881
While you were sitting...
Yes! While I was sitting
on those bleachers.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.617
Have you ever seen sex
from above, Cece?

04:11.619 --> 04:14.686
It's horrible. That's why
God thinks it's a sin.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.756
Also, Trashley gave him giardia
in his belly ring.

04:17.758 --> 04:21.193
Giardia is a river disease.
She had river mouth.

04:21.195 --> 04:23.061
Wasn't George Jiang,
like, six-11?

04:23.063 --> 04:25.564
Yeah. They called him
George Jiang the Giardia Giant,

04:25.566 --> 04:27.733
and I never got
to hold him in my arms.

04:27.735 --> 04:30.435
What are you gonna do?!

04:30.437 --> 04:32.471
Uh...

04:32.473 --> 04:34.373
Uh... nothing.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.308
I'm gonna be sweet
and kind and supportive.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.710
Look, peop-peop...
people change.

04:38.712 --> 04:41.146
People change.
It's been 15 years.

04:41.148 --> 04:43.715
She had sex with
our DARE officer!
- No way.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.418
There were rumors flying around
about every damn one.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.886
(chuckles)

04:47.888 --> 04:49.288
You remember the rumor about me?

04:49.290 --> 04:51.490
Oh, that you
shaved your chin?
- What?

04:51.492 --> 04:53.325
Was that was the rumor about me?

04:53.327 --> 04:55.761
That was the rumor.
- No. It was...

04:55.763 --> 04:58.397
definitely sexier than that.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.931
Thank you guys for coming. It's
really helpful that you're here.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.601
I'm trying to get my boss
to give me the new account.

05:02.603 --> 05:03.902
I just have to figure out

05:03.904 --> 05:05.470
how to sell sponges to men.

05:05.472 --> 05:06.505
What do I have?

05:06.507 --> 05:08.607
I have a blood-stained
idea notebook

05:08.609 --> 05:10.842
filled with terrible ideas.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.744
I don't know what to do,
you guys. Damn it!

05:12.746 --> 05:14.279
"Spongey make wipey."
I like that.

05:14.281 --> 05:16.181
Okay, please.
I don't have a lot of time.

05:16.183 --> 05:18.750
This is what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna say the word "sponge",

05:18.752 --> 05:21.320
and you guys are gonna say
the first word that pops

05:21.322 --> 05:23.355
into your head, okay?
Ready, one, two, three. Sponge.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.090
Sponge! That was mine.
Yellow.
- Sponge.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.124
Okay, let's just try this.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.459
We're gonna try this
one more time.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.027
Okay?
Just clear your head, okay?

05:29.029 --> 05:30.429
So I'm gonna say the word,
and you're gonna say

05:30.431 --> 05:31.697
the first word
that pops in your head.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.098
Okay, it might be "sponge."
Don't say "sponge."

05:33.100 --> 05:34.199
Sponge!
- Sponge.

05:34.201 --> 05:36.201
Damn it! Focus!

05:36.203 --> 05:37.936
I'm sorry.
Okay, let's just try it again.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.005
Give me a shot.
Give me a shot. Give me a shot.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.673
I'm gonna say "sponge"
one more time, first word

05:41.675 --> 05:43.041
that pops into your head. Ready?
One, two, three, sponge.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.876
Sponge. Aah!

05:44.878 --> 05:45.811
Winston!

05:45.813 --> 05:47.179
Sorry. So much pressure, man.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.114
Okay, you know what?
Let's move on to Coach.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.350
Coach, here we go.
You're the man of the group.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.185
You should be good at this.
We're selling sponges to men.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.686
Ready, one, two, three, sponge.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.688
Sponge.
- Why would you say that?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.156
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, come on, come on.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.458
One more time.
Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, sponge.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.159
Cake.
- What?

06:01.161 --> 06:02.027
Cake.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.495
Sponge cake.
No!

06:03.497 --> 06:05.397
We all know
that men are idiots.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.999
How long have you been
in my office?

06:08.001 --> 06:12.404
But what we don't know
is how much they love to clean.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.839
You're wasting my time,
Schmidt. Go.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.540
Come on, Gina, you have
to give me this account.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.042
They want
to market sponges to men.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.210
I'm the only man in the office.

06:18.212 --> 06:20.846
Oh, speaking of. Sherri,
you got the sponge account!

06:20.848 --> 06:23.515
Touchdown!
- Yeah.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.750
Just hear me out here.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.251
The reason why men don't talk

06:26.253 --> 06:27.886
about how much
they love to clean is

06:27.888 --> 06:29.521
because they're afraid
to admit it.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.856
Give me a chance here.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.191
Be the one to put Schmidt
on the map.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.193
Let's blast America
right in the face

06:35.195 --> 06:36.995
with a little bit
of Schmidt.
- Oh!

06:36.997 --> 06:38.497
God in heaven! Fine!

06:38.499 --> 06:40.265
Put together
a focus group, okay?

06:40.267 --> 06:41.600
I will do that.
This is exciting.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.001
All right. Maybe next week

06:43.003 --> 06:44.536
we'll start it?
- No. Today, 3:00.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.505
Today... today at 3:00?

06:46.507 --> 06:47.839
Today at 3:00?
- Mm-hmm.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.541
3:00 today--
that sounds great.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.009
I love that idea.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.211
Mm-hmm, you just... you just
earned a special thank you

06:53.213 --> 06:54.613
in my autobiography.

06:54.615 --> 06:57.916
Working title:
<i>Punting the Sweet Fantastic.</i>

06:57.918 --> 07:00.051
I feel like you kind of
have to do something

07:00.053 --> 07:01.486
to write a book about yourself.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.257
Sports!

07:05.259 --> 07:06.491
(screams)

07:09.595 --> 07:11.263
Oh, it's just so great
to see you guys again.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.798
Will you please
remind me?

07:12.800 --> 07:15.867
Were you there my first
senior year or my second?

07:15.869 --> 07:17.903
I was not good
at high school.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.237
(Bob and Ashley laugh)

07:19.239 --> 07:20.572
Oh, the early 2000s.

07:20.574 --> 07:21.940
God, I did so much E.

07:21.942 --> 07:25.477
Just doing E,
watching that show<i> Ed.</i>

07:25.479 --> 07:28.213
I would love to know
how you two lovers met.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.748
Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah, sure.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.583
Okay, so I was listening

07:31.585 --> 07:34.119
to him sing with his
band, The Co-Pays.
- Yeah, well...

07:34.121 --> 07:37.389
I didn't know you were
in a band, Dad.
Yeah, just-just me

07:37.391 --> 07:38.890
and a few other pharmacists.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.826
You know, we do alt rock covers.

07:40.828 --> 07:43.562
Oh, man, when he started
singing "She's So High"...

07:43.564 --> 07:49.167
¶ She's so high... ¶

07:49.169 --> 07:52.170
Stop. Because I'm gonna
fall in love again.

07:52.172 --> 07:55.474
Okay, go, I want to.
¶ She's so high... ¶

07:56.676 --> 07:57.843
ASHLEY (sighs):
Oh.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.845
Oh, man.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.746
That was it.
I was done.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.949
Ashley, have you kept in touch
with our DARE officer?

08:03.951 --> 08:05.183
Oh! Cece.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.185
Oh. Okay, I-I get it.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.820
You guys heard
about that rumor

08:08.822 --> 08:10.689
that I had sex with
the DARE officer?

08:10.691 --> 08:12.924
No! Only a crazy person...

08:12.926 --> 08:14.359
That rumor was true.

08:14.361 --> 08:15.660
(stammers)

08:15.662 --> 08:17.529
Crazy fun person.

08:17.531 --> 08:18.597
Oh, yeah, that guy.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.198
Wow, I did not
just say no.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.933
I said yes.
- Oh, yeah.

08:21.935 --> 08:25.136
I just said,
"Yes, yes, yes."
Oh, she said yes a lot.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.639
(laughs)
She's had sex
with hundreds of guys.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.875
Yeah.
You know, we spent
some time trying

08:29.877 --> 08:31.543
to total them all up.
It was fun.

08:31.545 --> 08:34.045
Killed a whole Saturday. Yeah.
We couldn't even
get through the list.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.614
We got to the "Ls."
- (laughs)

08:35.616 --> 08:38.116
But that was
in the past.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.785
And then I was diagnosed
with a sex addiction.

08:40.787 --> 08:42.287
Oh, great.
- Thankfully,

08:42.289 --> 08:44.055
I attended rehab.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.324
Which... did not
take the first time.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.859
Or the second.

08:47.861 --> 08:48.994
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.562
But third time's the charm.

08:50.564 --> 08:51.830
For a lot of people.
Not for me.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.665
For me, it took
four. Four times.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.167
Well, Bobby, we should get
ready to go to the beach.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.836
Okay.
- Yeah.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.638
Thank you so much for this
delicious brunch, Jess.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.239
It was wonderful.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.308
I ate so much, I'm gonna
have to bang nine guys

09:03.310 --> 09:04.409
just to work
it off. (laughs)

09:04.411 --> 09:06.211
Oh, my goodness.
- (Bob laughs)

09:06.213 --> 09:07.546
I'm kidding. I
did do that once,

09:07.548 --> 09:09.080
but I'm not gonna
do it this time.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.749
It's all in the past
for me.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.017
Isn't she great?

09:12.019 --> 09:13.585
I just love her.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.086
She makes me
laugh so much.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.721
(groaning)

09:16.723 --> 09:18.924
What? What-what,
are you humming?

09:18.926 --> 09:22.427
Mm... Dad, just so we
have this conversation...

09:22.429 --> 09:24.696
No, no, Jess.
She seems like the type of girl
who might hurt you.

09:24.698 --> 09:27.232
Jessica...
- I've seen you get hurt
by a lot less.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.733
Please, don't-don't
go there.

09:28.735 --> 09:32.103
No matter what you say, you're
not gonna change my mind.

09:32.105 --> 09:35.607
I'm in love with her,
and I'm gonna marry her.

09:38.344 --> 09:40.512
Gonna... get a new mom, Jess.

09:41.414 --> 09:46.251
BOB:
¶ She's so high... ¶

09:46.253 --> 09:49.554
Hey, are you okay? Because
I am not sure if you heard that,

09:49.556 --> 09:51.523
but there is going to be
a wedding.

09:51.525 --> 09:53.758
Oh...

09:53.760 --> 09:57.629
there will be no wedding.

09:57.631 --> 10:00.365
And it begins.

10:00.367 --> 10:03.068
Why are we meeting
in a parking garage?

10:03.070 --> 10:04.636
Because what we are
doing is unsavory

10:04.638 --> 10:06.304
and we're hiding from God.
And you also...

10:06.306 --> 10:07.772
you promised Winston and
everybody pizza, so...

10:07.774 --> 10:09.140
Yeah, you definitely did.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.242
Yes, there'll be pizza.
Just do one thing for me first.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.644
Here, memorize these.

10:12.646 --> 10:15.313
That's yours.
That's yours.

10:15.315 --> 10:19.050
"I love sponges because they
connect my heart to my hand."

10:19.052 --> 10:20.585
Look, I had to scramble,
you guys.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.921
I told my bosses how much
men love to clean.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.489
What are talking about?
Only you.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.124
Yeah, only... Yeah.
- I know!

10:26.126 --> 10:28.326
Why do you think
I'm rigging this focus group?

10:28.328 --> 10:31.162
"Sponges make me feel
more exhilarated

10:31.164 --> 10:32.931
"than any home run
or touchdown

10:32.933 --> 10:34.232
ever could."

10:34.234 --> 10:35.567
This is ridiculous, man.

10:35.569 --> 10:37.602
I'm out!

10:37.604 --> 10:39.337
I can buy my own pizza.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.806
Can somebody please
loan me $15?

10:41.808 --> 10:43.608
And maybe like 20, 25,
depending on toppings,

10:43.610 --> 10:44.943
'cause I'd love to get
a bunch of ham.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.645
Ham.
- What about the tip, dude?
What about tip?

10:46.647 --> 10:48.079
I don't give tips.
It's for delivery.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.247
You don't tip
delivery people, ever.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.448
You definitely tip
delivery people, but...

10:50.450 --> 10:52.083
Guys. Guys.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.486
I get sponges, this solves
all our problems. Okay?

10:54.488 --> 10:56.321
I make more money,
Nick gets his room back,

10:56.323 --> 10:58.023
I get my life
back on track.

10:58.025 --> 11:00.025
<i>Punting the Sweet Fantastic.</i>

11:00.027 --> 11:02.160
For the last time, Schmidt,
that doesn't mean anything!

11:02.162 --> 11:03.495
Fine. But I'm gonna
need one hour

11:03.497 --> 11:04.996
in a quiet room
to get into character.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.431
No.
Right on.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.601
After long and thoughtful
and careful consideration,

11:09.603 --> 11:11.002
Winston is in.

11:11.004 --> 11:14.205
Okay.
- Assuming pizza
is still on the table.

11:19.211 --> 11:20.712
Say "pizza" one more
time, Winston.

11:20.714 --> 11:21.813
No, just don't.
- Just don't.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.214
No, we just never talked about

11:23.216 --> 11:24.849
when we're gonna...
- Don't.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.851
Just don't bring it up.
He's getting really mad.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.486
Like, delivery of...
Say "pizza." Say
"pizza" one more time.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.121
Don't say it again.
Say "pizza" again.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.389
Pizza.
- Say "pizza"
one more time,

11:31.391 --> 11:33.058
I'm gonna k-kill you!
I just thought

11:33.060 --> 11:35.060
maybe we'd talk about toppings,
perhaps, or something.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.629
Okay.

11:37.631 --> 11:39.164
Not a mirror.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.799
Not a mirror,
you idiot.

11:40.801 --> 11:41.966
Not a mirror.

11:41.968 --> 11:46.471
Sponges make me feel exhilarated
more than any...

11:46.473 --> 11:49.240
Did you just say "sponges
make me feel exhilarated"?

11:49.242 --> 11:51.242
(chuckles):
No, no. I-I..

11:51.244 --> 11:52.677
What do you think of sponges?

11:52.679 --> 11:55.213
They're stupid.
- That's how I feel.
(laughs)

11:55.215 --> 11:57.582
I mean, who cares?
- Ex... That's
exactly how I feel.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.350
What do you think
of this whole place?

11:59.352 --> 12:01.086
I'd rather not be here.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.754
"Be here" is what
I was about to say.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.723
I'm Nick.
- I'm Brittany.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.825
Oh, my God, we have
so much in common.

12:06.827 --> 12:07.726
Okay.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.360
My dad can't marry her.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.396
He gets hurt in relationships
with normal women.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.865
Yeah.
- He can't handle
a recovering sex addict.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.867
No.
- What if she relapses?

12:15.869 --> 12:18.369
It would crush him.
It would crush his heart.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.572
I can't let this happen.
I have to protect him.

12:20.574 --> 12:24.075
So what are you gonna do?
I could write him a letter
about my feelings.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.878
We... Yeah, but her
phone is in her purse,

12:26.880 --> 12:29.748
and we could check her
phone for dirt on her.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.852
But he hates letters.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.787
He always gets so frustrated
opening the envelope.

12:35.789 --> 12:38.857
You know you want to check her
phone. You know you want to.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.892
Cece, we're adults; we're gonna
handle this like adults.

12:40.894 --> 12:41.960
We're not snooping.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.194
You're right,
you're right.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.362
That is...
that's a huge violation

12:44.364 --> 12:46.131
of privacy;
you can't do that.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.032
Put that...
What does it say?

12:48.034 --> 12:49.400
It's bad.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.536
Mm.
- Give that to me.

12:51.538 --> 12:52.804
(gasps)

12:52.806 --> 12:54.973
Dad, she's cheating on you!

12:54.975 --> 12:56.407
What?

12:56.409 --> 12:57.475
Yeah, just ask Jim.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.577
At 10:40, Jim heard
she was in town.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.980
At 11:52,

13:01.982 --> 13:04.716
Jim had his hands
down his pants.

13:04.718 --> 13:05.984
And at 11:53...

13:05.986 --> 13:07.786
Cumin?

13:07.788 --> 13:09.888
What, is he
cooking cumin?

13:09.890 --> 13:11.089
(clears throat)

13:11.091 --> 13:12.490
Oh, my God.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.926
My dad is the best guy in
the world, and you better

13:14.928 --> 13:17.595
hit the damn road, unless
you want to say hello to

13:17.597 --> 13:20.131
my old friends
Crabtree and Evelyn.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.168
That's my work phone.
I'm a sex therapist.

13:24.069 --> 13:25.103
Jim is my client.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.472
Your... your client?

13:27.474 --> 13:29.808
Client!
- Client.

13:29.810 --> 13:31.242
Client.
- Client.

13:31.244 --> 13:34.145
Am I supposed
to say "client" now?

13:34.147 --> 13:36.481
I'm gonna go.
This was clearly a mistake.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.349
No.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.350
And for the record,

13:39.352 --> 13:41.252
George Jiang gave<i> me</i> giardia.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.288
I saved you from
a hideous river disease.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.690
Thank you.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.329
Damn it. She won't answer
any of my calls.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.164
I left ten voice mails.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.934
Two of them, I'm screaming.
Three, I'm crying.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.703
One is a long silent one.
Nothing!

13:58.705 --> 14:00.839
And it's all your fault--
both of you guys.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.106
But mostly you.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.474
Look, Dad, I'm so sorry.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.109
Is there anything I can do...

14:05.111 --> 14:07.011
There's nothing more
that you can do.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.681
I-I knew this was a mistake
bringing her here.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.783
Wait, Dad.

14:11.785 --> 14:13.718
(door slams)

14:16.355 --> 14:17.722
SCHMIDT: So, uh, why
don't you tell me

14:17.724 --> 14:19.524
what you think about
that sponge there, Coach.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.726
I mean... (clears throat)
Ernie.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.561
I don't know why
I would call you Coach.

14:23.563 --> 14:24.896
Okay.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.497
Um...
(clears throat)

14:26.499 --> 14:27.966
Well, I love sponges

14:27.968 --> 14:30.201
because they connect
my heart to my hand.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.871
Wow, thank you so much for that.
I wish my buddies
could see me now.

14:32.873 --> 14:35.039
What?
They'd be all like, "Hey, man,

14:35.041 --> 14:37.208
let me get a hit of
that squishy whip."

14:37.210 --> 14:40.211
Right on. Way to, uh,
add your own take.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.380
Uh, to-to your...
to your own take.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.082
WINSTON: You know, I-I have
something I'd like to add.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.583
Please.
Um, I like cleaning.

14:45.585 --> 14:46.918
You like cleaning.
It is the only thing

14:46.920 --> 14:49.854
I can control in a world
filled with chaos.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.189
Thank you.
- May I add,

14:51.191 --> 14:56.427
I am Thor, and this is
my hammer, Mjölnir.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.229
M... Melnir. Mjölnir.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.099
Okay, wonderful detail.
Thank you so much for that.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.234
Uh, how about you down there,
Mayor of the Corner?

15:03.236 --> 15:04.602
(chuckles)

15:04.604 --> 15:06.070
(pounds table) Nick.
What?

15:06.072 --> 15:08.172
How does cleaning
make you feel?

15:08.174 --> 15:10.008
Uh, like I-I'm cleaning. Move on
to somebody else, please.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.176
(quietly): Read the cards that
I gave you. Remember the cards?

15:12.178 --> 15:13.678
Not now.
- (pounds table) Read your cards!

15:13.680 --> 15:15.914
You want to know what I
think about your sponges?!

15:15.916 --> 15:17.348
(imitates farting)

15:17.350 --> 15:18.883
(laughs)

15:18.885 --> 15:20.218
(laughs)

15:20.220 --> 15:21.853
Well, this is
clearly rigged.

15:21.855 --> 15:23.054
My office.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.689
Now, Schmidt.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.124
Schmidt...

15:28.394 --> 15:30.328
Schmidt, I'm sorry.
(door closes)

15:32.398 --> 15:33.765
Dad.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.600
Thanks for waiting.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.269
I wasn't waiting. I just can't
get this damn thing started.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.104
You're just pressing buttons.

15:40.106 --> 15:43.308
This was supposed to be a big
weekend for me and Ashley.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.442
I had everything
planned.

15:44.444 --> 15:48.246
I-I even wrote new
lyrics to our-our song.

15:48.248 --> 15:54.052
(high-pitched):
¶ Ashley, marry me... ¶

15:57.723 --> 15:58.990
(engine starts)

15:58.992 --> 16:01.059
Y-You didn't have to
do that, you know.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.393
I can take care of myself.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.262
Can you?

16:04.264 --> 16:05.897
Dad, if I hadn't

16:05.899 --> 16:08.399
protected you after
you and Mom's divorce,

16:08.401 --> 16:10.668
you would've ended up
with Nancy Zimmerman.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.904
Oh, Nancy Zimmerman.
She was bad news, Dad.

16:12.906 --> 16:14.806
Ooh, v-very bad. You don't
know the half of it.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.141
That woman made me
try cocaine in 2005.

16:17.143 --> 16:17.942
What, Dad?!

16:17.944 --> 16:19.577
Booger sugar?
- Yes.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.112
Nicaraguan yazz.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.281
Are you kidding me?
- It was a very
expensive evening.

16:23.283 --> 16:26.417
I wound up buying
his and her Jet Skis.

16:26.419 --> 16:29.520
The point is I'm
still standing,

16:29.522 --> 16:32.290
and I can take
care of myself.

16:32.292 --> 16:36.127
Yes, I might get hurt,
but that'll be my problem.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.696
You don't need to
do it anymore, Jess.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.532
I should be taking
care of you.

16:42.868 --> 16:46.838
Ashley is different from
any woman I've ever dated.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.674
She-she makes
every day better.

16:49.676 --> 16:53.678
I-I want to spend the
rest of my life with her.

16:53.680 --> 16:57.148
Aw, Dad, that's so sweet.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.349
(car alarm chirps)
Hey!

16:58.351 --> 16:59.484
Hey, th... Ashley!

16:59.486 --> 17:00.985
JESS:
What did she do?

17:00.987 --> 17:03.154
She went out and found a guy?

17:03.156 --> 17:04.522
She's gonna relapse. Um...

17:04.524 --> 17:06.324
Oh, we have to turn her off.
Ashley...

17:06.326 --> 17:08.793
Let's turn on NPR
and blare it.
- Oh...

17:13.032 --> 17:14.332
Ashley, wait.
Wait a minute. Please.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.900
Please don't do this. Please.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.135
JESS: Ashley, if
you're gonna relapse,

17:17.137 --> 17:18.503
relapse with my dad.

17:18.505 --> 17:20.872
I'm not relapsing.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.907
This is Roy.
He's my L.A. sponsor.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.709
BOB:
This is Roy? Oh!

17:24.711 --> 17:27.178
You know, I-I always wanted
to meet you. Hi.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.580
Jess, he's not a strange man.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.649
He's a sex addict.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.152
Former sex addict.
Uh, current chocoholic.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.721
I'd be in trouble
if you were black.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.356
Thank you?

17:38.358 --> 17:41.225
Ashley, look, I screwed up.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.361
I have to let my dad
make mistakes.

17:43.363 --> 17:44.495
Oh, I'm a mistake?

17:44.497 --> 17:45.663
No, you are not a mistake.

17:45.665 --> 17:46.998
That came out wrong.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.766
I'm sorry, Bob.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.335
I never meant to come
between you and your daughter.

17:51.337 --> 17:52.703
I love you
so damn much.

17:52.705 --> 17:55.673
You're my big, round, bald,

17:55.675 --> 17:57.208
fuzzy Weeble-Wobble.

17:57.210 --> 18:00.611
But I just...
I just need a little space.

18:05.717 --> 18:07.351
It's not over, Dad.

18:07.353 --> 18:08.719
Get the ring.

18:08.721 --> 18:09.921
I'm sorry, Schmidt.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.289
What can I say?

18:11.291 --> 18:13.057
You're just not really built
to play with the big girls.

18:13.059 --> 18:14.959
Don't fire him!
- Oh, God.

18:14.961 --> 18:17.562
What the... Why?
Give him the account.

18:17.564 --> 18:20.565
He's a hard worker,
and he's a neat freak.

18:20.567 --> 18:23.701
How do I know that?
'Cause I share a room with him.

18:23.703 --> 18:24.769
You two share a room?

18:24.771 --> 18:26.104
And you should see
his side.

18:26.106 --> 18:29.640
It is so clean. It looks like
the inside of a Japanese subway.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.043
Speaking of sharing a bedroom,
Brittany's coming over tonight.

18:32.045 --> 18:35.580
Uh, so I'm gonna need ten
to 15 minutes of privacy for...

18:35.582 --> 18:37.248
I don't need 15 minutes.
That's excessive.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.549
Give me five to ten.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.952
That feels braggy.
Give me three to five,

18:40.954 --> 18:43.054
but no less than three
'cause that's rude to girls.

18:43.056 --> 18:44.956
Do you really think that
she's gonna have sex with you

18:44.958 --> 18:47.225
in that pulp-covered
filth bunker?
I'll throw a tarp down.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.626
Oh, God.
SCHMIDT:
What if she's turned off

18:48.628 --> 18:51.329
by the mess?
What if she's turned off by...

18:53.232 --> 18:55.666
What if she's turned
off by the mess?

18:55.668 --> 18:57.401
Hey, Gina, why don't you hear me
out here for a second.

18:57.403 --> 18:59.137
That's all right.
If Nick cleans his room

18:59.139 --> 19:00.938
before Brittany comes
over, he might get laid.

19:00.940 --> 19:03.441
I don't know.
It seems like a lot of work.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.276
Not with the right tool.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.011
We open up
on a modern man

19:07.013 --> 19:08.779
with a nose that only
America could love.

19:08.781 --> 19:09.747
This might seem obvious,

19:09.749 --> 19:11.282
but what side does
the dirty stuff go on?

19:11.284 --> 19:12.650
He doesn't know a lot,

19:12.652 --> 19:14.752
but he's about to discover
the ultimate wingman.

19:14.754 --> 19:15.953
NICK:
I bet this side is

19:15.955 --> 19:17.288
really good for tough areas.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.956
The Man Sponge.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.025
Because the dirtiest
thing in your room...

19:21.027 --> 19:22.793
Probably be her.
(chuckles)

19:22.795 --> 19:24.529
Yay. We're doing a pitch.

19:24.531 --> 19:25.830
Yeah.
- (chuckles)

19:25.832 --> 19:29.767
I... can't believe
I'm saying this,

19:29.769 --> 19:31.135
but I like it.

19:31.137 --> 19:32.970
All right, you get
the sponge account, Schmidt.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.605
Sponges.
- We got sponges.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.607
We got sponges.
We got sponges.
- We got sponges.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.176
JESS:
Wait!

19:38.178 --> 19:41.012
Ashley! My dad loves you!

19:41.014 --> 19:41.946
No matter what! Wait!

19:41.948 --> 19:44.282
¶ Ashley... ¶

19:44.284 --> 19:46.284
On your right!
- Left side!
- On your right.
- On your left.

19:46.286 --> 19:47.018
(Jess whimpering)

19:47.020 --> 19:48.853
On your right!
- Left!

19:48.855 --> 19:50.188
Right!
- Bread and butter.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.489
On your left.
- On your right.

19:51.491 --> 19:52.490
(Jess continues whimpering)

19:52.492 --> 19:53.457
Oh, my God!

19:53.459 --> 19:55.793
Left side!
Left side!

19:55.795 --> 19:57.895
¶ Ashl... ¶
On your right!

19:57.897 --> 19:59.230
BOB:
Jess!

19:59.232 --> 20:01.365
Jess, baby, baby, are you okay?
Oh.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.335
You... Here, come on, come on.
Let's get you to a hospital.
Yeah. Yes.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.137
Oh, my God!
Is she okay?
- I don't know.

20:06.139 --> 20:07.071
I mean, are you okay?

20:07.073 --> 20:08.906
You need to do
it now, Dad,

20:08.908 --> 20:11.375
before we get flattened
by a parade. Come on.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.415
Ashley... will you marry me?

20:17.417 --> 20:20.685
And be the stepmom
to a very crazy

20:20.687 --> 20:23.654
but-but very lovable woman?

20:23.656 --> 20:26.023
(chuckles):
Yes.

20:26.025 --> 20:29.694
Yes. Yes!

20:29.696 --> 20:30.928
Oh, yes!

20:30.930 --> 20:33.831
Jess, you're
my little girl now.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.066
Oh, Jess.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.034
You go to your room.
(laughs): I'm just kidding.

20:37.036 --> 20:40.404
I'm kidding. But you should
go to a-a hospital.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.508
Here's to attending a wedding
with everyone from high school

20:44.510 --> 20:46.410
and my dad's side of the family.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.212
It's gonna be great.
It's like going to prom

20:48.214 --> 20:49.780
with all my dad's friends.
NICK: Hear, hear!

20:49.782 --> 20:50.781
(cheering)

20:50.783 --> 20:52.717
Oh.
- Oh.

20:52.719 --> 20:53.884
No, no, no, no.
Don't worry, don't worry.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.353
I got it. I got it.
I'll just clean it.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.554
COACH:
Dude, there's a sponge

20:56.556 --> 20:58.623
in your hand.
SCHMIDT: No, let him go.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.424
He's my inspiration.
You know, living with him

21:00.426 --> 21:03.894
in that slovenly hellhole
has been a secret blessing.

21:03.896 --> 21:04.895
It's made me stronger.

21:04.897 --> 21:05.963
Without ash to rise from,

21:05.965 --> 21:08.099
the phoenix would just be
a bird getting up.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.067
I am a phoenix, and I will rise.

21:10.069 --> 21:12.103
He usually says that speech
before sex.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.038
By 2015, I will have
my own room.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.307
And by 2016...

21:18.410 --> 21:19.810
COACH:
What is he looking at?
I don't know.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.146
...I will be a millionaire.
(all groaning)

21:22.148 --> 21:24.882
(piano playing gentle music)

21:36.094 --> 21:37.728
(gasps)

21:37.730 --> 21:39.997
Spongey make wipey.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.133
ANNOUNCER:
<i>The Man Sponge.</i>

21:42.135 --> 21:44.802
<i>Because the dirtiest thing</i>
<i>in your room...</i>

21:44.804 --> 21:49.507
Should be me.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.409
Sponge. Sponge. Sponge.
Sponge. Sponge.
Sponge. Sponge. Sponge.
