01:52.242 --> 01:53.896
[sighs, sniffs]

01:54.070 --> 01:55.419
[clears throat]

02:05.821 --> 02:07.039
Ow! Ow.

02:07.214 --> 02:08.998
How many times I got
to tell you?

02:09.172 --> 02:10.826
Take out your teeth.

02:18.703 --> 02:20.270
Very simply...

02:20.444 --> 02:23.969
a journalist
was shot and killed.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.972
Now, a note was left
on his body, reading:

02:27.147 --> 02:29.845
"Kill all reporters."

02:30.019 --> 02:31.934
And yet the ASA

02:32.108 --> 02:35.503
is instead prosecuting
my client,

02:35.677 --> 02:38.767
saying Chris shot him.

02:38.941 --> 02:40.290
Why?

02:40.464 --> 02:43.815
Because he was
supposedly being paid

02:43.989 --> 02:47.254
by my colleague's client
to be a hit man.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.038
Now, does that sound

02:49.212 --> 02:50.387
overly complicated to you?

02:50.561 --> 02:53.085
Because it does to me.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.958
[sighs]:
Uh... reporters are being

02:56.132 --> 02:57.873
targeted by protesters

02:58.047 --> 02:59.875
all over the world.

03:00.049 --> 03:02.704
You have your Saudi assassins,

03:02.878 --> 03:04.445
your alt-righters,

03:04.619 --> 03:08.797
your Maltese hit men, and...

03:12.496 --> 03:14.803
And yet the, uh...

03:14.977 --> 03:16.674
the ASA...

03:16.848 --> 03:19.808
is, in fact, targeting

03:19.982 --> 03:21.766
two innocent men.[speaking indistinctly]

03:21.940 --> 03:24.291
I mean, why not go
after the extremists

03:24.465 --> 03:26.641
who want to kill reporters?

03:26.815 --> 03:28.164
Would you fuck me?

03:28.338 --> 03:30.253
That note--
"Kill all reporters"--

03:30.427 --> 03:32.473
it tells us that this was

03:32.647 --> 03:33.865
a political act.Good morning, Your Honor.

03:34.039 --> 03:35.998
I'd like to approach
the bench, if I may.

03:36.172 --> 03:37.565
JUDGE: You realize
you've just interrupted

03:37.739 --> 03:39.393
your colleague's opening,
Mr. Blum?

03:39.567 --> 03:41.786
Yes, and I only do so
in the interest

03:41.960 --> 03:43.571
of saving the court time.

03:43.745 --> 03:46.138
Approach.

03:46.313 --> 03:48.793
You're wearing that?What is it,
Mr. Blum?

03:48.967 --> 03:50.447
Let me put it this way.

03:50.621 --> 03:53.145
It does a grave disservice
to my client...

03:53.320 --> 03:56.105
to compel him
to be tried jointly

03:56.279 --> 03:57.759
with this...

03:57.933 --> 03:59.804
young lady's client.You're objecting

03:59.978 --> 04:01.937
to this now?
I only just learned of it.

04:02.111 --> 04:03.330
Counsel was notified
six weeks ago.

04:03.504 --> 04:04.809
This is a
joint trial.

04:04.983 --> 04:07.812
Step back.
Let your colleague continue.

04:08.944 --> 04:11.294
Reasonable doubt.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.731
Burden of proof.

04:13.905 --> 04:16.212
I mean, outside the courtroom
we never hear these words.

04:16.386 --> 04:17.648
[chuckles]

04:17.822 --> 04:21.130
But we come in here
and we put on a pageant,

04:21.304 --> 04:23.132
and we pretend we don't care

04:23.306 --> 04:26.657
about the very thing
we care about the most:

04:26.831 --> 04:29.660
who actually killed this guy!

04:29.834 --> 04:32.141
Well, this court case
is different,

04:32.315 --> 04:35.275
because I know who killed him.

04:40.323 --> 04:41.672
This...

04:41.846 --> 04:43.761
is who.

04:43.935 --> 04:46.590
Objection, Your Honor.Why
would you object?

04:46.764 --> 04:48.200
What are you afraid of?[gavel banging]

04:48.375 --> 04:50.290
DAVIES: Wait a minute.
Now, I'm not gonna let this

04:50.464 --> 04:52.161
get out of hand.
So stop it.

04:52.335 --> 04:53.597
What's he doing?Nothing.

04:53.771 --> 04:55.643
We just need to keep
to our defense.

04:55.817 --> 04:57.297
BLUM:
Thank you, Your Honor.

04:57.471 --> 04:58.646
Lawyers.

04:58.820 --> 05:00.082
[chuckles]

05:00.256 --> 05:02.998
Oh, they'll tell you, always:

05:03.172 --> 05:05.870
"This case is not a whodunit."

05:06.044 --> 05:08.960
Well, I'm saying the opposite:
"This is a whodunit."

05:09.134 --> 05:11.485
And this is who done it.

05:11.659 --> 05:13.269
No objection at this point?

05:14.879 --> 05:16.403
At the appropriate time,

05:16.577 --> 05:18.840
I'm gonna open
this envelope,

05:19.014 --> 05:20.494
and I'm gonna
read you the name

05:20.668 --> 05:22.365
that is written on
a piece of paper.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.541
First...

05:24.715 --> 05:27.414
you're gonna say,
"That's impossible.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.720
That's insane."

05:32.244 --> 05:35.335
But then you're
gonna think about it.

05:35.509 --> 05:37.598
And then you're gonna say...

05:37.772 --> 05:41.210
[snaps fingers]"How could it
be anybody else?"

05:49.392 --> 05:51.307
How indeed?

05:57.313 --> 05:59.359
[chuckles]:
Geoffrey. Hey.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.796
Any last-minute
words of wisdom?Well, we don't have anyone

06:01.970 --> 06:03.363
with matrimonial experience,

06:03.537 --> 06:05.190
and you're bringing six
clients in with you.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.279
I don't think you need
any last-minute words,

06:07.454 --> 06:08.498
wise or otherwise.

06:08.672 --> 06:09.978
Just stay out
of politics?

06:10.152 --> 06:12.720
Welcome to my
world, brother.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.896
[laughter]GEOFFREY:
So, I said to the judge,

06:15.070 --> 06:17.028
"Custody goes to values,
Your Honor.

06:17.202 --> 06:18.639
It turns on one issue."

06:18.813 --> 06:20.031
What is that?

06:20.205 --> 06:21.946
White Sox or Cubs.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.252
[others laugh]

06:23.426 --> 06:24.819
That's great.

06:24.993 --> 06:26.603
Uh, any other questions?

06:26.777 --> 06:27.909
LUCCA:
Uh...

06:28.083 --> 06:29.737
[clears throat]
I have one.

06:29.911 --> 06:32.217
It's about your record
in matrimonial litigation.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.784
Ask away.

06:33.958 --> 06:35.656
Well, it might be
nothing more than a coincidence,

06:35.830 --> 06:37.832
but in looking through your CV,
I noticed that the vast majority

06:38.006 --> 06:39.790
of your clients are men.

06:39.964 --> 06:43.228
Is there any particular
reason for that?I think it's the firm.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.057
We're all-service, and
many of our CEOs and VCs

06:46.231 --> 06:48.451
are transferred over
from acquisitions.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.410
Tell me what
your worry is.Well, I've been shepherding

06:50.584 --> 06:52.847
a lot of our divorce cases here
in the last few weeks,

06:53.021 --> 06:55.589
and 60% are women.Well, if you're worried,

06:55.763 --> 06:57.417
I work just as well
with men as women.

06:59.027 --> 07:00.768
Uh, excuse me, please.

07:00.942 --> 07:03.031
I got in touch
with the clinic in Tanzania,

07:03.205 --> 07:05.033
the one that handled
Kurt's injury.

07:05.207 --> 07:07.209
Their English is
actually better than mine.And?

07:07.383 --> 07:09.341
Nurse Doto said it was
an accidental shooting

07:09.516 --> 07:11.431
by another member
of the hunting party,

07:11.605 --> 07:14.129
and it was 48 hours
before he was brought in.

07:14.303 --> 07:16.087
So what was the delay?

07:16.261 --> 07:17.524
She didn't say.

07:17.698 --> 07:19.569
But then I...

07:19.743 --> 07:21.658
checked Eric Trump's
Instagram.

07:21.832 --> 07:23.573
And?He posted

07:23.747 --> 07:25.836
a picture of himself
standing over a dead giraffe

07:26.010 --> 07:28.273
within that
48-hour period.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.841
You're telling me Kurt was
shot by one of the Trumps,

07:31.015 --> 07:32.843
but they didn't take
him to a doctor

07:33.017 --> 07:35.367
because they wanted
to shoot a giraffe?

07:35.542 --> 07:38.414
I don't want to draw
a conclusion, but... yeah.

07:42.374 --> 07:44.376
ADRIAN:
He's got the experience

07:44.551 --> 07:46.030
and comes
with six divorce clients.

07:46.204 --> 07:48.032
I say nobody we've seen
comes close.

07:48.206 --> 07:50.034
[chuckles]: Let's...
let's just hire the man.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.819
You won't
be sorry.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.298
Lucca?

07:58.216 --> 07:59.653
What?
I...

07:59.827 --> 08:01.350
think we should keep looking.
JULIUS: Looking?

08:01.524 --> 08:03.221
Wh-What are we
looking for?For someone who doesn't

08:03.395 --> 08:04.788
only look at the
men in the room.

08:04.962 --> 08:08.705
Okay. No disrespect to Lucca,
but this is really

08:08.879 --> 08:10.925
a partner-level
decision.No, no. Lucca has been handling

08:11.099 --> 08:13.101
our matrimonial clients--
I think we should take

08:13.275 --> 08:15.059
her opinion into account.ADRIAN:
What do you want to do?

08:15.233 --> 08:16.974
LIZ:
Let's keep looking at other people.

08:17.148 --> 08:20.587
Look, we do not need to come to
a decision right at this minute.

08:27.245 --> 08:29.117
Are you wanting the job?

08:29.291 --> 08:31.772
The...?
Heading up matrimonial.

08:31.946 --> 08:34.035
Oh, that's not
why I was arguing...

08:34.209 --> 08:35.515
Do you want the job?

08:36.994 --> 08:38.953
I don't know.Well, decide,

08:39.127 --> 08:40.694
because this guy is
way ahead of you,

08:40.868 --> 08:42.478
and I'm gonna have
to vote for him

08:42.652 --> 08:44.480
unless you can make a
strong case against it.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.354
How's it lookin'?Good.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.531
You got six out of
the eight votes.

08:51.705 --> 08:54.621
I'll try not to let myself
get too excited quite yet.[chuckles]

08:54.795 --> 08:56.057
That's smart.

08:56.231 --> 08:58.189
Looking forward to
working with you.

08:58.363 --> 09:01.149
That may not happen,
in any case.

09:01.323 --> 09:03.586
What do you mean?[closes door]

09:03.760 --> 09:05.414
I'm not supposed to say
anything, but I was

09:05.588 --> 09:06.981
at a Historical Law
Society wine tasting,

09:07.155 --> 09:08.722
and according to a
reliable source...Bob?

09:08.896 --> 09:11.115
No, a reliable source.[chuckles]

09:11.289 --> 09:14.945
You're near the top of the list for
an appointment to the Seventh Circuit.

09:17.034 --> 09:20.081
A... a federal judgeship?Yes.

09:20.255 --> 09:21.952
You're kidding.No.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.346
I'm not high-profile enough.You're black.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.348
And conservative.

09:26.522 --> 09:29.133
And people whose business
it is to know...

09:29.307 --> 09:31.048
know about you.

09:32.223 --> 09:34.008
So, what was that about?

09:34.182 --> 09:35.792
What?Encouraging Lucca

09:35.966 --> 09:37.794
to rip into Payton.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.840
I didn't encourage her.
I just said that

09:40.014 --> 09:42.320
we should take her opinion
into account.Geoffrey Payton

09:42.494 --> 09:44.322
makes sense
for this firm, Liz.

09:44.496 --> 09:46.411
He brings in
top-drawer clients.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.327
Yeah, and he's a member of
the Historical Law Society.

09:49.501 --> 09:51.895
[laughs]:
Ah. I knew it!

09:52.069 --> 09:53.767
Liz, you're bringing
politics into this,

09:53.941 --> 09:55.116
in a way that's not...No.

09:55.290 --> 09:56.944
Politics isin this.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.815
And since when did you
become a Republican?

09:58.989 --> 10:00.208
Oh, please.
I'm trying

10:00.382 --> 10:01.818
not to let politics
get in the way

10:01.992 --> 10:03.559
of moving the firm forward.And this is

10:03.733 --> 10:06.736
our first hire since
our fresh start, so I am having

10:06.910 --> 10:08.433
a second look, okay?

10:08.608 --> 10:09.870
So...

10:10.044 --> 10:11.654
I guess we're back to...

10:11.828 --> 10:13.874
"who are we?"

10:14.048 --> 10:15.832
I don't think we ever left it.
But you do agree

10:16.006 --> 10:17.878
we should be looking ahead
to the future?Yeah,

10:18.052 --> 10:19.531
a future where Trump wins
in 2020.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.359
[laughs]: What?No, no, I see

10:21.533 --> 10:22.796
what you're doing.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.232
These associates
you're trying to hire,

10:24.406 --> 10:26.408
and-and this partner--
you want to bring in

10:26.582 --> 10:28.497
more conservative voices.We're hiring

10:28.671 --> 10:30.412
a matrimonial attorney, Liz.

10:30.586 --> 10:33.589
It shouldn't make a difference
what his politics are.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.635
This is about the makeup
of the firm.

10:35.809 --> 10:38.028
This is exactly who we are.

10:38.202 --> 10:39.682
I thought you wanted
a fresh start.I do.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.945
But as Audre Lorde said,

10:42.119 --> 10:43.991
"The master's tools
will never dismantle

10:44.165 --> 10:45.949
the master's house."

10:48.343 --> 10:51.041
If you have access...

10:51.215 --> 10:55.611
any single fuckin' tool will
dismantle the master's house.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.483
Grady Burkhardt.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.008
I was Tony Mundy's editor.And at the time
of his death,

11:01.182 --> 11:03.663
what story was
Mr. Mundy working on?

11:03.837 --> 11:05.665
GRADY: An investigative piece
about Avery Ward,

11:05.839 --> 11:07.492
using defective
building materials

11:07.667 --> 11:09.320
that were responsible
for three people dying

11:09.494 --> 11:10.931
in a fire.And did this story

11:11.105 --> 11:12.976
suggest there was
criminal negligence?

11:13.150 --> 11:14.717
Objection. Calls
for speculation.

11:14.891 --> 11:17.024
Doesn't matter.
Let it go.

11:17.198 --> 11:18.808
Sustained.Mr. Burkhardt,
do you recognize

11:18.982 --> 11:21.419
this thumb drive?It's a recording

11:21.593 --> 11:23.813
Tony Mundy made of a call
he received from Avery Ward.

11:23.987 --> 11:25.510
Ask the recording

11:25.685 --> 11:27.338
be introduced into evidence

Stipulate to authenticity,
Your Honor.

11:31.778 --> 11:34.606
DAVIES: Unusual point of agreement.
Let's play the tape.

11:34.781 --> 11:38.785
You think the jury wants to sit
through an expert witness?

You lying motherfucker!

11:40.395 --> 11:41.918
If you publish this shit,
so help me God

11:42.092 --> 11:43.659
I'm going to run you down
in the street.

11:43.833 --> 11:46.314
I'm gonna make you suffer
so much, you're gonna beg me

11:46.488 --> 11:48.577
to finish you off.Pick your head up.
Look straight ahead.

11:50.971 --> 11:52.886
MAIA:Before you became
an editor, you were

11:53.060 --> 11:54.148
an investigative reporter.

11:54.322 --> 11:55.497
You ever receive any threats?

11:55.601 --> 11:56.628
I did.And would you

11:56.803 --> 11:58.195
ever notify the police

11:58.369 --> 12:01.459
or hire
private security?No.

12:01.633 --> 12:04.245
And is that because in
an overwhelming number of cases,

12:04.419 --> 12:07.161
such threats didn't warrant
being taken seriously?

12:07.335 --> 12:09.467
GRADY: It's different now.
"Kill all reporters."

12:09.641 --> 12:11.600

in Istanbul, in...

12:11.774 --> 12:13.254
Okay,

12:13.428 --> 12:15.256
just a few questions.
DAVIES: Excuse me.

12:15.430 --> 12:16.648
Let your colleague finish.I'm sorry, dear,

12:16.823 --> 12:18.781
were you--
were you not finished?

12:18.955 --> 12:21.218
I'll defer to
my colleague.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.833
Are you familiar with articles
that ran in Der Spiegel

12:27.007 --> 12:29.836
on a pedophile ring
operating out of Antwerp?

12:30.010 --> 12:31.054
No.

12:31.228 --> 12:32.926
Would it surprise
you to learn

12:33.100 --> 12:35.058
that Tony Mundy
was working on a piece

12:35.232 --> 12:37.365
that tied
that same pedophile ring

12:37.539 --> 12:39.715
to certain political figures

12:39.889 --> 12:41.804
in Chicago?Objection.

12:41.978 --> 12:43.850
[whispers]:
Oh, I bet there's an objection.

12:44.024 --> 12:46.983
Oh, you don't want me opening
that door, do you, Matan?

12:47.157 --> 12:48.680

Objection's sustained.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.857

first become aware

12:51.031 --> 12:54.512
of the ties between the Cook
County States Attorney's office

12:54.686 --> 12:56.514
and a pedophile ring in Antwerp?

12:56.688 --> 12:58.386
Objection! This is outrageous.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.909
No, what's outrageous is

13:00.083 --> 13:02.433
that a prosecutor would have
one man murdered

13:02.607 --> 13:04.696
and two innocent men charged
with the crime.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.829
Your Honor, these are vile
and groundless allegations.

13:07.003 --> 13:08.613
BLUM: I don't do groundless,
Your Honor.

13:08.788 --> 13:12.400
I said I would name
the individual responsible

13:12.574 --> 13:14.445
for this murder...

13:14.619 --> 13:17.492
and that... is what I'm doing.

Mr. Blum, if you have a question

13:22.540 --> 13:23.846
for the witness,

13:24.020 --> 13:25.674
please ask it.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.110
If not, sit down.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.025
When did you learn

13:29.199 --> 13:31.027
that it was the
prosecutor himself

13:31.201 --> 13:33.508
who had Tony Mundy killed?

13:33.682 --> 13:34.988
This is insane!

13:35.162 --> 13:37.425
Oh, is it, sir? Is it?

13:37.599 --> 13:39.122

13:39.296 --> 13:40.907

That's supposed
to be a bow.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.070

Hans and Franz,
your safari buddies--

14:59.724 --> 15:01.813
they're the ones

For the first time, we will be
living here and working here.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.210
And you can't even tell me

15:07.384 --> 15:09.604
because you signed
that fucking NDA.

15:09.778 --> 15:13.216
Is it possible for you
to get past your hatred of them?

15:13.390 --> 15:15.001
Just tell me
one thing, Kurt.

15:15.175 --> 15:17.829
Why did it take them so long
to get you to the hospital?

15:18.004 --> 15:19.483
Was it because they
didn't want to miss

15:19.657 --> 15:21.833

that they scheduled?

15:22.008 --> 15:23.313
Where is this coming from?

15:23.487 --> 15:25.359
Their Instagram.

15:25.533 --> 15:28.057
They forced you to sign
an NDA, and meanwhile,

what I think is important,

named David Howell.

43:46.355 --> 43:48.226
Do you know him?Yes.

43:48.401 --> 43:50.664
He was my boyfriend
for three long years.

43:50.838 --> 43:53.144
BLUM:
Ah. Did you ever

43:53.318 --> 43:55.233
hear him mention
the prosecutor,

43:55.408 --> 43:57.671
Matan Brody?Yeah. He said

43:57.845 --> 43:59.890
Matan was his
Get Out of Jail Free card.

44:00.064 --> 44:02.937
Your Honor,
I ask to confer with co-counsel.

44:03.111 --> 44:04.289
I'm almost done here.

44:04.314 --> 44:05.326
It's a matter
of some importance.

44:05.330 --> 44:06.419
You're suborning

44:06.593 --> 44:09.204
perjury.No, I am neutralizing

44:09.378 --> 44:10.684
a potentially damaging witness.

44:10.858 --> 44:11.989
What's your next point?You either get her

44:12.163 --> 44:13.687
to walk back her testimony--

44:13.861 --> 44:15.645
say it was a case of
mistaken identity or something--

44:15.819 --> 44:18.518
or I am going to the judge.

44:18.692 --> 44:20.702
Okay.
[exhales]

44:20.796 --> 44:23.523
So here's where the
training wheels come off.

44:23.547 --> 44:26.917
You go anywhere
near that judge,

44:26.961 --> 44:30.530
and I make one phone call to my
boy in the police department.

Simultaneous raids of your
office, apartment and car,

sure to turn up

44:37.875 --> 44:39.974

you took from me.

44:40.018 --> 44:41.932
I didn't take anything from...I'm
guessing possession

44:41.986 --> 44:44.457
of a deluxe assortment

45:26.368 --> 45:28.631
Thank you.

45:40.398 --> 45:43.167
BLUM: Mr. Ward,
did it surprise you

45:43.341 --> 45:46.736
that you were being made
the fall guy for this murder?

45:46.780 --> 45:49.696
It surprises me any time someone
in a position of public trust,

45:49.870 --> 45:52.655
like the prosecutor,
does something dishonest.

45:52.829 --> 45:54.527
But I guess if you're capable
of having a man murdered,

45:54.701 --> 45:57.138
you're also capable of accusing
somebody else of doing it.

45:57.312 --> 45:58.356
Thank you.

45:58.391 --> 46:01.446
I have nothing further.

Anything, Prosecutor?

Nothing for this witness, Your Honor.

DAVIES:
All right.

46:07.540 --> 46:09.063

you're excused.

46:09.237 --> 46:11.631

Wait. Your Honor, I, uh...

46:14.329 --> 46:16.636
Uh, well, Mr. Ward
is my witness.

46:16.810 --> 46:18.986
Yes, and I have questions
for him.

She's right.

46:22.424 --> 46:24.513
Mr. Ward, hi.

46:24.513 --> 46:26.176
Chris Colman does security

46:26.200 --> 46:27.961
for you.
Is that correct?

46:28.005 --> 46:29.440
Yes.

46:29.455 --> 46:31.399
Has he ever served as a driver

46:31.573 --> 46:32.748
for your daughter Samantha?

46:32.772 --> 46:34.121
He may have,
on occasion.

46:34.195 --> 46:36.676
Why?Did you ever ask him
to do anything other

46:36.700 --> 46:39.616
than drive on behalf of
your daughter Samantha?

46:39.790 --> 46:42.967
AVERY: Not that I recall.Well, let me
see if I can help you recall.

46:43.142 --> 46:45.274
Now, your daughter,
she was dating

46:45.448 --> 46:48.321
an individual named Ahmed Nassif
at one point, was she not?

46:48.495 --> 46:49.757
Your Honor,
I think my co-counsel

46:49.931 --> 46:51.846
may not be working
off current information.

46:52.020 --> 46:53.674
May I be allowed
to confer with her?

46:53.848 --> 46:55.763
Well, I'd like to proceed,
Your Honor. We can confer later.

46:55.937 --> 46:57.199
Go for it.

46:57.373 --> 47:00.985
Did you ever
ask Mr. Colman

47:01.160 --> 47:02.639
if he could arrange
to have Ahmed killed?

47:02.813 --> 47:04.641

co-counsel may be suffering

for a brief recess

her a candy bar.

Oh, I don't need a candy bar,
Your Honor.
