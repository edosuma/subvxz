01:11.303 --> 01:13.704
The music that she
was making, it turned

01:13.898 --> 01:16.398
everything into this
incredible light show.

01:16.465 --> 01:18.333
You sure you weren't
just at the Planetarium?

01:18.651 --> 01:20.818
Maybe it was synesthesia
this really interesting

01:20.886 --> 01:22.954
mental condition a lot
of geniuses have.

01:23.022 --> 01:25.624
Oh yeah it's where like one
sense crosses over into another.

01:25.691 --> 01:26.990
Mhm, except...

01:27.391 --> 01:30.362
she would see music,
as opposed to hearing it.

01:30.429 --> 01:31.962
Like is she going
to hear a Van Gogh

01:31.963 --> 01:34.665
or see a Jay-Z tune...
kind of genius really.

01:34.732 --> 01:38.935
This not so much;
she forgot her bow.

01:39.003 --> 01:41.539
Yeah, right, that's uhm...

01:41.606 --> 01:44.875
that's one way to put it.

01:50.046 --> 01:52.648
<i>911 what is the nature
of your emergency?</i>

01:54.310 --> 01:58.413
My name is Dmitri Volkov,
I have just killed my father.

02:18.733 --> 02:20.933
Is that medieval, is
that baroque or gothic?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.967
Somebody got killed with
a silver bullet I'm hearing.

02:22.968 --> 02:23.869
That's like a werewolf.

02:23.870 --> 02:26.138
- That's not vampires?
- No, it's a werewolf.

02:26.205 --> 02:26.872
You know what you're
talking about or are you

02:26.940 --> 02:27.873
making it up?

02:27.941 --> 02:29.107
Do you know any vampires?

02:29.175 --> 02:30.108
Personally?

02:30.110 --> 02:31.143
Yeah.

02:31.210 --> 02:32.878
Not since high school.

02:44.457 --> 02:45.924
Okay now see, now the
wheels won't come down.

02:45.991 --> 02:49.227
Tell me why they need to
replace the old stretchers.

02:49.295 --> 02:50.995
You want state-of-the-art
you pay the price.

02:51.063 --> 02:52.696
Come on.

02:54.332 --> 02:56.033
Oh sure, it works for you.

02:56.101 --> 02:58.369
We hate this thing.

03:01.172 --> 03:02.606
Hey, where's the victim?

03:02.674 --> 03:04.241
In the living room.

03:04.309 --> 03:07.010
Got a deceased in there as
well; coroner's just declared.

03:07.078 --> 03:08.578
Oh nice place.

03:08.645 --> 03:10.346
Belongs to the Russian
Consul General.

03:10.414 --> 03:13.550
He's lying on the floor
inside with his head caved in.

03:13.617 --> 03:16.686
Right here is the injured guy.

03:18.355 --> 03:19.622
You really need to
take off these cuffs.

03:19.690 --> 03:21.524
I don't know if
that's a good idea.

03:21.592 --> 03:23.292
I don't think he'll
give you any trouble.

03:23.359 --> 03:25.294
Detective, we'll be
taking over from here.

03:25.361 --> 03:28.297
That's it?
You just take my case?

03:28.364 --> 03:30.665
Yeah, it's not
a problem is it?

03:30.733 --> 03:32.067
You kidding?

03:32.135 --> 03:34.869
We love coming to crime
scenes and just leaving.

03:34.937 --> 03:36.638
Do you have any idea the
amount of paperwork a case

03:36.706 --> 03:38.574
like this is
going to generate?

03:38.641 --> 03:39.941
Always looking out for us.

03:40.009 --> 03:42.978
Thanks Michelle... Good luck.
Get the cuffs off.

03:44.080 --> 03:47.882
That's a nice looking
uniform you got there.

03:47.950 --> 03:49.851
Gallery opening.

03:49.919 --> 03:51.685
I'm going to take his
pressure in the rig.

03:51.690 --> 03:52.996
All right, just going
to walk him out?

03:53.010 --> 03:53.421
Yeah.

03:53.420 --> 03:54.422
With the stretcher?

03:54.490 --> 03:55.490
Yeah.

03:55.557 --> 03:56.958
- Let's get him out of here.
- All right.

03:57.526 --> 03:59.426
So IIB gets called in on a
political hot potato and

03:59.494 --> 04:00.694
you lose your night off.

04:00.762 --> 04:02.529
Yeah, pretty much...
lucky for me this

04:02.530 --> 04:04.865
seems pretty open and shut,
right Mr. Volkov?

04:04.933 --> 04:08.869
He tried to kill me.
I had no choice.

04:14.842 --> 04:16.676
Okay.

04:22.783 --> 04:24.484
Is there anyone else here?

04:24.552 --> 04:27.287
Not according
to new reports.

04:27.355 --> 04:29.288
I think you open and shut
case is about to get a lot

04:29.356 --> 04:30.989
more complicated.

04:46.829 --> 04:48.162
Alright there Mr. Volkov

04:48.170 --> 04:49.664
Watch your feet there, okay.

04:49.732 --> 04:51.132
Now he's all
yours officer.

04:51.140 --> 04:51.866
All right.

04:51.934 --> 04:52.990
- Thank you.
- No problem.

04:59.407 --> 05:02.643
<i>There's no one
to take care of Paval...</i>

05:03.111 --> 05:05.512
<i>...he's alone...</i>

05:07.548 --> 05:08.348
Dev?

05:08.350 --> 05:09.149
Yeah.

05:09.217 --> 05:10.717
What do you have
on the deceased?

05:10.784 --> 05:13.720
Fyodor Volkov entered the
diplomatic service in 1975...

05:13.721 --> 05:16.550
1985 to '88 he was with
the Embassy in Ottawa.

05:16.556 --> 05:19.024
He transferred to Toronto
as the Deputy Minister of

05:19.025 --> 05:20.792
Foreign Affairs, and get
this...three years ago?

05:20.793 --> 05:22.962
He was named the
Consul General.

05:23.030 --> 05:24.664
Are you hungry?

05:24.732 --> 05:26.865
I'd really kill for like some
avacados and banana fosters.

05:26.933 --> 05:28.667
What are you
like pregnant?

05:28.735 --> 05:30.502
What about the son?

05:30.569 --> 05:33.671
Dmitri Volkov. HeÂ´s 27,
he was born in Russia,

05:33.739 --> 05:37.007
raised in Toronto and
he's a accountant executive

05:37.010 --> 05:38.643
at a Bay Street brokerage firm.

05:38.710 --> 05:41.378
No priors, not even a little
toe over the line this guy.

05:41.380 --> 05:43.280
Any previous
domestic trouble?

05:43.348 --> 05:44.349
No, nothing in the file

05:44.350 --> 05:46.583
but who's to say some
strings haven't been pulled.

05:46.652 --> 05:48.218
It's about Mexican.

05:48.286 --> 05:49.653
Yeah, I'll meet you.

05:51.155 --> 05:52.588
Wait a sec...

05:52.657 --> 05:56.425
I did a little
reading on Dmitri...

05:56.493 --> 05:59.595
so far all I
got is he keeps saying

05:59.664 --> 06:00.964
something about this
guy named Paval.

06:01.532 --> 06:04.367
Any idea of age?

06:04.434 --> 06:06.635
I can stir him up...

06:06.703 --> 06:09.437
I know, I'm still not used
to getting my information

06:09.505 --> 06:10.806
from someone who
wasn't even there.

06:10.874 --> 06:12.174
Got to park right here.

06:22.418 --> 06:25.720
Dmitri why did you
attack your father?

06:25.788 --> 06:27.955
I told him to stay
out of my life.

06:28.023 --> 06:31.092
And why did you want him
to stay out of your life?

06:31.160 --> 06:32.894
Because he was become the
father who would attack

06:32.961 --> 06:35.997
his son with a
letter opener.

06:36.065 --> 06:37.932
Okay look I won't insult
your intelligence as long

06:38.000 --> 06:39.433
as you don't insult mine.

06:39.501 --> 06:41.502
We know that there was
someone else in that house

06:41.570 --> 06:43.237
besides you and
your father.

06:55.982 --> 06:58.318
I have no idea what
you are talking about.

06:58.385 --> 07:01.020
There's someone at the desk
saying he is Mr. Volkov's lawyer.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.222
Oh.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.260
Did you get anything?

07:07.328 --> 07:08.661
Yeah I saw the Dmitri
wiping down a statue.

07:08.729 --> 07:11.796
Why would he wipe down the murder
weapon and then call and confess?

07:11.864 --> 07:14.700
Well maybe he was trying to protect
the person who really used it.

07:14.892 --> 07:15.925
Listen I gotta get back.

07:15.993 --> 07:17.594
Thanks.

07:19.096 --> 07:22.366
Sgt. McCluskey IIB, you must
be Mr. Volkov's attorney.

07:22.683 --> 07:24.084
I'm also his brother.

07:24.151 --> 07:26.419
You're...

07:26.487 --> 07:28.654
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

07:28.722 --> 07:30.889
Thank you.

07:30.957 --> 07:33.792
You can't imagine how
difficult this is,

07:33.860 --> 07:37.496
not only for me,
for all of us.

07:37.563 --> 07:41.734
Our father he was an
extraordinary man.

07:41.801 --> 07:43.935
Is Dmitri all right?

07:44.003 --> 07:46.604
Yeah he's fine under
the circumstances.

07:46.672 --> 07:48.506
I want to see for myself.

07:48.573 --> 07:50.207
Have you been
questioning him?

07:50.275 --> 07:52.644
With his consent.

07:52.711 --> 07:54.912
I'm sure you were most
professional but he was

07:54.980 --> 07:58.215
not fit to be interviewed
given what has occurred.

07:58.283 --> 07:59.616
I disagree.

07:59.684 --> 08:02.185
Further his counsel was
not present for your

08:02.253 --> 08:05.255
questioning and finally as
a Russian citizen and a

08:05.322 --> 08:06.723
son of a Diplomat
he has...

08:06.791 --> 08:08.158
Diplomatic immunity.

08:08.225 --> 08:09.993
Yeah that's the first
thing we looked into.

08:10.061 --> 08:12.262
I should warn you though,
we may contest that.

08:15.298 --> 08:18.734
You say we just watch him, we get
on a plane and fly back to Russia.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.169
The Russians want
him on a plane,

08:20.236 --> 08:22.104
Ottawa wants him on a plane.

08:22.172 --> 08:23.673
Why don't you want
him on a plane?

08:23.740 --> 08:25.841
Last I heard there was a
great court system in Moscow.

08:25.909 --> 08:28.210
You remember the Russian
diplomat in the fatal

08:28.278 --> 08:29.645
hit and run back in Ottawa?

08:29.713 --> 08:31.412
I know where you're
going with this.

08:31.480 --> 08:33.347
He claimed diplomatic, went
back home and skated on it.

08:33.414 --> 08:34.582
I'm not going to
let that happen.

08:34.650 --> 08:35.950
This is murder;
the guy confessed.

08:36.018 --> 08:37.418
He's not going to skate.

08:37.486 --> 08:38.886
You don't know that.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.755
Listen, this is a done deal,

08:40.799 --> 08:46.294
so unless you know
something I don't know...

08:49.530 --> 08:51.732
...you know something
I don't know?

08:51.800 --> 08:55.635
I think there might have
been someone else involved.

08:55.704 --> 08:59.707
A partner or someone he was
covering for, I'm not sure yet.

08:59.774 --> 09:01.274
Based on?

09:01.342 --> 09:02.775
Cop's sense.

09:02.843 --> 09:05.812
Oh what judge
wouldn't buy that.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.714
I'm just asking if we
can hold on to him for

09:07.781 --> 09:09.949
a few days while we
check this out.

09:10.017 --> 09:11.417
Michelle there are two
Ministers coming in from

09:11.484 --> 09:15.287
Ottawa this morning and they got
he entire staff on red alert.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.156
And I know how much
you love a challenge.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.524
I have complete
faith in you.

09:19.592 --> 09:22.327
I have a love/hate relationship
with you... mostly hate.

09:22.394 --> 09:23.929
I'll see what I can do.

09:23.996 --> 09:25.563
Thanks.

09:25.631 --> 09:26.664
Absolutely.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.567
Mom, mom, can
you just....?

09:29.635 --> 09:31.302
Hold on, hold on.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.805
Oh so it turns out to true,
there's two brothers okay.

09:33.873 --> 09:36.107
The lawyer friend that
we know, Yuri and also

09:36.174 --> 09:37.274
another who goes by
the name of...

09:37.342 --> 09:38.308
...Paval.

09:38.376 --> 09:39.844
Yeah.

09:40.912 --> 09:42.446
I got to tell you right
now, this thing is not...

09:42.513 --> 09:43.714
is not reliable.

09:43.782 --> 09:45.983
Why can't we just say
thanks but no thanks.

09:46.051 --> 09:47.818
There's been uptake
in back injury claims over

09:47.886 --> 09:50.987
the last year so like it
or not we're stuck with it.

09:53.157 --> 09:54.824
It works when
you do it, great.

09:54.892 --> 09:57.894
All right, so the manual
says that it's idiot proof,

09:57.962 --> 09:59.428
so who would
like to test it out?

10:03.734 --> 10:05.802
Anyone like to volunteer?

10:05.870 --> 10:08.036
Any one at all?

10:08.104 --> 10:10.739
Yeah, I'd love to, yeah
I'll do it, sure, great.

10:10.807 --> 10:11.940
All right.

10:12.008 --> 10:13.441
Way to take one for
the team Mr. Bay.

10:13.509 --> 10:16.278
Yea, for the team.

10:16.345 --> 10:17.612
I'm not covering anyone's
shift for a month,

10:17.680 --> 10:18.613
thank you very much.

10:18.681 --> 10:20.048
Hi...

10:20.116 --> 10:22.050
Hey, what time
do you get off?

10:22.118 --> 10:24.285
I got off in about
ten minutes, why?

10:24.352 --> 10:25.787
We found Paval.

10:25.854 --> 10:28.489
Really? you want me to
listen in on the interview?

10:28.556 --> 10:31.425
Yeah if you can get away.

10:31.493 --> 10:33.227
Hey officer, it slunk.

10:33.295 --> 10:34.395
Yeah, I think I'll
have no problem.

10:34.462 --> 10:35.529
Do you want to
wait a minute?

10:35.597 --> 10:36.831
- Sure.
- Cool.

10:43.304 --> 10:44.771
It's a nice place.

10:44.839 --> 10:47.407
Yeah, it's Dmitri's, Paval
lives here with his brother.

10:58.451 --> 10:59.885
How can I help you?

10:59.953 --> 11:01.954
Sgt. McCluskey, IIB.

11:02.022 --> 11:03.355
This is Toby Logan.

11:03.423 --> 11:04.523
Can we have a word?

11:04.590 --> 11:07.159
Uhm, please come in.

11:09.462 --> 11:10.595
It's about
Dmitri isn't it?

11:10.663 --> 11:13.531
Yes it is, Ms...

11:13.598 --> 11:14.899
Uhm... Renyeska,

11:14.967 --> 11:17.568
Yekaterina Renyeska, but
you call me Katja.

11:17.636 --> 11:20.504
So what's your connection to
the family? Are you a relative?

11:20.572 --> 11:24.542
Uhm... No...
I look after Paval.

11:24.609 --> 11:27.010
Paval suffers from a
severe form of autism.

11:27.078 --> 11:29.379
Autism, really.

11:29.447 --> 11:31.315
Can we speak with him?

11:31.382 --> 11:33.016
What about?

11:33.084 --> 11:35.685
His brother.

11:35.753 --> 11:37.855
Of course but I'm sure
you're not going to hear

11:37.922 --> 11:39.256
anything from him.

11:39.324 --> 11:40.657
Okay thank you.

11:41.726 --> 11:42.859
Ms. Ra... Ray...

11:42.926 --> 11:44.727
Renyeska, Sgt. McCluskey.

11:44.794 --> 11:47.263
Thank you.

11:47.331 --> 11:49.031
Have there been any
arguments between Dmitri

11:49.099 --> 11:50.900
and his father?

11:50.968 --> 11:55.004
No, none! That
is what's so odd.

11:55.072 --> 11:56.572
This is you?

11:56.639 --> 11:57.907
Yeah.

11:57.975 --> 11:59.640
You're very photogenic.

11:59.708 --> 12:01.809
Thank you, I
used to model.

12:01.878 --> 12:03.945
Now you're a
fulltime nanny?

12:04.013 --> 12:07.615
Well it's a fulltime job
to look after Paval.

12:19.795 --> 12:22.029
Hey Paval. Hi.

12:22.097 --> 12:24.465
I'm Toby.

12:25.801 --> 12:27.368
This is a really
amazing train set.

12:27.436 --> 12:31.872
Did you build this?

12:31.939 --> 12:35.074
Wow, look at
all your people.

12:35.142 --> 12:39.279
That's very cool.

12:47.687 --> 12:48.621
Who's this here?

12:48.688 --> 12:51.824
Huh, huh, huh...

12:51.892 --> 12:54.293
It's okay.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.128
Paval it's okay.

12:56.195 --> 12:58.764
That's Dmitri and Yuri,
the picture was taken back

12:58.832 --> 13:00.966
in Russia.

13:01.034 --> 13:02.935
Fyodor and...

13:03.002 --> 13:06.370
Their mother.
She died soon after the picture.

13:06.439 --> 13:07.705
And Paval?

13:07.773 --> 13:10.341
Born to another woman,
Canadian woman.

13:10.409 --> 13:11.810
She left.

13:11.877 --> 13:14.045
Autistic boy was too much
for her so he goes to a

13:14.112 --> 13:18.716
special school and I look
after him the rest of the time.

13:18.784 --> 13:19.883
Where were you last night?

13:21.251 --> 13:23.100
- With Paval.
- Here?

13:23.120 --> 13:24.855
Yeah.

13:24.923 --> 13:26.824
Why doesn't he live
with his father?

13:26.891 --> 13:29.259
He was travelling so much
he couldn't take good care

13:29.327 --> 13:32.128
of him, that's why
he lives with us.

13:32.196 --> 13:35.933
Hey, hey, Paval it's okay.

13:46.610 --> 13:48.711
Hey, it's okay... no.

13:50.081 --> 13:51.481
Paval!

13:51.548 --> 13:53.882
Are you okay?

13:53.950 --> 13:55.250
Oh my God, what
did you do to him?

13:55.318 --> 13:58.087
I just touched him on the
knee and he freaked out.

13:58.154 --> 13:59.455
He cannot stand
to be touched.

13:59.522 --> 14:00.555
I'm sorry.

14:00.623 --> 14:01.857
I think you need
to leave now.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.426
Sorry.

14:09.498 --> 14:11.632
Paval...

14:35.738 --> 14:38.339
Slide gusset collar
to release auto lock.

14:38.407 --> 14:42.310
Do not place unnecessary
fingers into hinge mechanism.

14:42.377 --> 14:43.778
It sounds like it was
translated from another

14:43.846 --> 14:45.412
language by someone who
doesn't speak English.

14:45.479 --> 14:46.413
Somebody's going to hurt
themselves on this

14:46.480 --> 14:47.748
stupid machine.

14:47.816 --> 14:52.052
Nobody's going to
hurt themselves.

14:54.288 --> 14:56.056
Would you mind taking
your shoes off please?

14:56.124 --> 14:58.525
Hey you talked to that
little brother right?

14:58.593 --> 15:00.660
Hm... he's autistic.

15:00.728 --> 15:04.130
I had a hard time getting
through but he,

15:04.198 --> 15:07.066
he's actually amazingly
focused on his own thing.

15:07.134 --> 15:08.634
You know I have a
cousin who's autistic.

15:08.702 --> 15:10.002
Oh yeah?

15:10.070 --> 15:12.071
Yeah my uncle Eric on my
mother's side; he married

15:12.139 --> 15:14.974
a woman with a lovely
little daughter named Eva.

15:15.042 --> 15:16.808
You could name any date in
history and she would tell

15:16.876 --> 15:18.944
you what day of the
week it fell on.

15:19.011 --> 15:20.678
It was sweet but
kind of creepy.

15:20.747 --> 15:23.648
I was inside the kid's
mind for a few seconds;

15:23.716 --> 15:26.118
it was amazing 'cause it's
like he was living inside

15:26.185 --> 15:27.886
his train set.

15:27.954 --> 15:30.822
Yeah it sounds like Eva,
the way she would find a

15:30.890 --> 15:33.157
safe place in
her own mind.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.193
Listen to this...

15:38.296 --> 15:39.897
Do you know any
other notes?

15:41.699 --> 15:43.267
Do you have any
good news for me?

15:43.334 --> 15:45.803
None, not on
the home front.

15:45.871 --> 15:47.738
It seems Fyodor and
Dmitri are like any father

15:47.806 --> 15:49.405
and son; a few spats here
and there but nothing out

15:49.473 --> 15:51.007
of the ordinary.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.508
What about Yuri?

15:52.576 --> 15:56.746
Same and Paval's virtually
catatonic so that all but

15:56.814 --> 15:58.081
eliminates him.

15:58.149 --> 16:00.083
Do you think
Katja's involved?

16:00.151 --> 16:01.785
Here's the thing; there
is nothing indicating

16:01.852 --> 16:02.952
she even exists.

16:03.020 --> 16:04.520
An illegal immigrant.

16:04.588 --> 16:08.223
Yeah and oh, turns out the
Consulate General is quite

16:08.291 --> 16:09.491
the entrepreneur.

16:09.558 --> 16:11.960
I love it when you dish.

16:12.028 --> 16:15.430
One of his companies is a
talent agency specializing

16:15.498 --> 16:17.599
in Russian models.

16:17.667 --> 16:20.102
Katja was a model.

16:20.170 --> 16:23.805
You have no interest in visiting
Russian models, do you Dev?

16:23.872 --> 16:26.640
I would like to visit
Russian models.

16:26.708 --> 16:28.943
Yeah, that's
what I thought.

16:36.211 --> 16:38.220
It's alright to smile...

16:39.887 --> 16:41.554
You were asking about?

16:41.622 --> 16:43.456
Fyodor Valkov.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.859
Terrible news; he was
one of my investors.

16:45.927 --> 16:47.227
He didn't own it outright?

16:47.295 --> 16:49.796
No, no, no, it
was partnership.

16:49.864 --> 16:52.398
He supplied the capital,
I found the talent.

16:52.466 --> 16:54.066
This talent, they
all come from Russia?

16:54.134 --> 16:57.203
There is an unlimited pool
of beautiful young women there.

16:57.270 --> 16:59.671
Tatyana, Tatyana,
keep smiling.

16:59.739 --> 17:05.577
And all your women, they
all have visas and work permits?

17:05.645 --> 17:07.346
I can only assume sir.

17:07.413 --> 17:09.780
...you have lovely cheekbones.

17:09.848 --> 17:12.516
I also have a
lovely badge.

17:12.584 --> 17:15.185
How involved was
Mr. Volkov with the talent?

17:15.253 --> 17:18.656
Well there's no secret Fyodor
had an eye for the ladies.

17:18.723 --> 17:20.959
In fact he took one of
them away from me and gave

17:21.026 --> 17:23.994
her a job; something
she was good for.

17:24.063 --> 17:26.029
What was this
woman's name?

17:26.097 --> 17:28.832
Katja Renyeska.

17:30.634 --> 17:32.903
Don't, don't say it.

17:34.538 --> 17:36.573
That's what you saw;
synapses firing with

17:36.640 --> 17:38.708
nothing to stop
him... sensory overload.

17:38.776 --> 17:40.210
That's acute autism.

17:40.278 --> 17:42.044
Oz was just telling
me about his has this

17:42.112 --> 17:47.751
autistic cousin and she takes
comfort in creating order.

17:47.818 --> 17:49.018
Mhmm.

17:49.086 --> 17:51.053
Those kids, they
find their refuges.

17:51.121 --> 17:54.123
Problem is they're wired to
keep the rest of the world out.

17:54.191 --> 17:58.026
So all I have to do is find
a way into this boy's world.

17:58.094 --> 17:59.495
Mhmm, just don't
underestimate how

17:59.562 --> 18:01.630
difficult that is.

18:01.698 --> 18:03.365
I never do.

18:03.433 --> 18:05.567
Right.

18:05.635 --> 18:08.970
I'm vibrating.

18:09.038 --> 18:10.639
Yeah, so am I.

18:10.707 --> 18:13.074
I should probably
look at this.

18:13.142 --> 18:14.876
I have to take this.

18:14.943 --> 18:16.377
Hello?

18:16.445 --> 18:17.712
Sgt. McCluskey.

18:17.780 --> 18:20.681
<i>Hey, I got another
job for you.</i>

18:20.749 --> 18:22.082
What have you got?

18:22.150 --> 18:23.785
I need to know exactly
what the relationship

18:23.852 --> 18:25.887
between Fyodor
and Katja was.

18:25.954 --> 18:29.457
You think you can come up with a
reason to go talk to her again?

18:31.893 --> 18:33.760
Yeah, I think I can
come up with something.

18:43.037 --> 18:44.103
Hey, hi.

18:44.171 --> 18:45.471
Hi.

18:45.539 --> 18:48.741
I just, I was wondering
how Paval's doing.

18:48.809 --> 18:51.009
He is fine, under
the circumstances.

18:51.077 --> 18:53.512
Right I feel bad
about yesterday.

18:53.580 --> 18:54.980
It's okay.

18:55.048 --> 18:58.283
I uhm... I brought him
a little something.

18:58.351 --> 19:00.619
Hope I can make
it up to him.

19:00.687 --> 19:02.320
Come in, you can give
it to him yourself.

19:02.387 --> 19:03.822
Ah, thank you.

19:09.662 --> 19:11.796
Hey.

19:13.532 --> 19:17.068
It's Toby, remember me?

19:17.135 --> 19:20.471
I brought you a...
I brought you some figures,

19:20.538 --> 19:22.673
some policemen.

19:22.740 --> 19:26.109
I thought maybe
I'd put them here.

19:29.814 --> 19:31.448
This is Michelle.

19:31.516 --> 19:33.616
Remember Michelle?

19:33.684 --> 19:37.920
I'm going to pop
her right here.

19:37.988 --> 19:42.492
And this is
me, your buddy.

19:42.559 --> 19:44.694
I'm going to put
myself right there.

19:50.666 --> 19:58.072
â™ª]

19:58.140 --> 20:00.542
Who's this?
Who's the Station master?

20:08.182 --> 20:09.216
It's you...

20:09.317 --> 20:12.352
Whoa, that's cool.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.354
Who's underground??

20:16.625 --> 20:18.626
Is that your father?

20:18.693 --> 20:21.594
Why is your father...?

20:31.371 --> 20:32.438
It's okay.

20:35.643 --> 20:39.310
Hey...

20:42.113 --> 20:44.181
Dmitri I know what it's
like to have a volatile

20:44.182 --> 20:47.719
relationship with a father.

20:47.787 --> 20:50.522
I can tell that you
really loved him.

20:50.590 --> 20:53.358
What would he want
you to do right now?

20:53.426 --> 20:56.561
He would want me to accept
responsibility for what

20:56.628 --> 20:59.363
I have done and I have.

21:08.040 --> 21:10.540
Forensics found smudge
marks beneath your

21:10.608 --> 21:14.811
fingerprints on
the murder weapon.

21:14.879 --> 21:18.281
You wiped it down
before you handled it.

21:18.348 --> 21:20.850
Why would you do that
unless you were trying...

21:20.918 --> 21:22.618
The cleaning lady must
have wiped it down.

21:24.989 --> 21:27.890
See, I just find
this very odd.

21:27.958 --> 21:30.726
Here I am offering you an
out and you're not taking it.

21:30.794 --> 21:31.727
Dimitri perhaps...

21:32.796 --> 21:35.263
English.

21:40.036 --> 21:44.105
My client stands by his
previous statement.

21:44.172 --> 21:45.640
Then I guess this
interview is over.

21:45.708 --> 21:48.810
No, not yet.

21:48.877 --> 21:51.846
Tell me about
Miranov Talent.

21:51.914 --> 21:52.880
Never heard of it.

21:52.948 --> 21:54.849
Really?

21:54.917 --> 21:56.918
Your father was an
investor in it.

21:56.986 --> 22:00.286
Our father had
many investments.

22:00.354 --> 22:05.558
Well this one was special;
it is where he met Katja.

22:05.627 --> 22:08.595
And isn't it true that
his interest in her was

22:08.663 --> 22:10.998
beyond simply being
Paval's nanny?

22:11.065 --> 22:15.034
Wait a minute, Katja had
nothing to do with this.

22:15.102 --> 22:20.439
I said I was guilty; why
would I lie about that?

22:20.507 --> 22:22.441
You tell me.

22:32.952 --> 22:36.522
I think it's
enough for today.

22:41.160 --> 22:44.094
His train set means
everything to him.

22:44.163 --> 22:46.464
Fyodor loved
watching him play.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.266
So his father
was around a lot.

22:48.333 --> 22:50.468
Not a lot but he would
check with me on the phone

22:50.536 --> 22:51.869
almost every day.

22:51.936 --> 22:54.604
So you and Fyodor
were close?

22:54.672 --> 22:56.373
You're a beautiful woman,
was there...?

22:56.440 --> 22:58.741
He was my employer.

23:10.187 --> 23:12.421
Well, I should get going.

23:12.489 --> 23:13.955
Thank you for
letting me see him.

23:14.023 --> 23:18.360
Hey Paval, thank you, bye.

23:18.428 --> 23:19.495
Bye.

23:19.563 --> 23:20.596
Bye.

23:34.338 --> 23:36.639
Katja and Dmitri
were lovers.

23:36.707 --> 23:38.441
That certainly
explains a lot.

23:38.509 --> 23:39.876
He has every reason to protect her...

23:39.943 --> 23:42.144
he has diplomatic immunity
and she doesn't.

23:42.212 --> 23:43.880
So we're looking at
a love triangle...

23:43.947 --> 23:46.281
Right, which always ends well.

23:46.349 --> 23:49.718
Okay Fyodor finds out
about Dmitri, argues with

23:49.786 --> 23:54.656
Katja, she hits him,
panics, calls Dmitri for help.

23:54.724 --> 23:58.093
He arrives, he sees what's
happened and he acts fast.

23:58.160 --> 24:00.328
Comes over, wipes down
the murder weapon

24:00.396 --> 24:02.797
and calls the police.

24:02.865 --> 24:06.734
Too bad we don't have
one sliver of evidence.

24:06.802 --> 24:09.036
I actually have to get
back to my day job.

24:09.104 --> 24:10.738
Thank you.

24:12.508 --> 24:14.141
I'm putting together a
timeline on Katja on the

24:14.209 --> 24:16.243
day of the killing; I think
you might find it interesting.

24:22.850 --> 24:24.518
So where were you the
night of the murder?

24:27.254 --> 24:28.688
You picked up Paval at his
school and according to

24:28.756 --> 24:31.625
his teacher you were taking
him to visit his father?

24:31.692 --> 24:34.026
So were you at
Fyodor's house?

24:38.465 --> 24:41.467
All right, we were there.

24:41.535 --> 24:44.202
I dropped him home at six,
I picked him up at nine,

24:44.270 --> 24:46.038
the same as every week.

24:46.105 --> 24:48.573
And when you came to pick him up
did you actually see Fyodor?

24:48.641 --> 24:50.241
Yeah, of course.

24:50.309 --> 24:55.246
He seemed a little troubled but,
other than that he was fine.

24:55.314 --> 24:57.482
That was at, um, nine...?

24:57.550 --> 25:01.252
Yeah.

25:01.320 --> 25:04.355
The Coroner said that he
died no later than 8:30.

25:07.725 --> 25:11.027
Well the Coroner
is obviously wrong.

25:11.095 --> 25:13.129
We checked with
Immigration Canada,

25:13.197 --> 25:15.933
we know you are here illegally
and we know you're lying.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.468
You have a chance to help
yourself out if you just

25:18.469 --> 25:20.903
tell us the truth.

25:20.971 --> 25:24.707
Listen, I've told you
everything I know.

25:32.415 --> 25:34.216
So to be clear the Coroner's
reports aren't in, right?

25:34.284 --> 25:35.217
No.

25:35.285 --> 25:36.651
That was good.

25:36.719 --> 25:38.152
You're in charge of
lying from now on.

25:38.220 --> 25:40.822
So this is our
prank victim.

25:40.890 --> 25:44.025
Yeah, you know it's
just flesh wounds.

25:44.093 --> 25:48.630
A little superglue,
toilet and...

25:48.698 --> 25:50.198
...genius.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.033
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you just
going to leave me here?

25:53.101 --> 25:57.805
We'll get you bed okay,
just keep a lid on it...

25:57.873 --> 25:59.573
You need a bed.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.775
Yeah. Wow.

26:01.843 --> 26:05.112
Must have been some party.

26:06.548 --> 26:07.948
This is kind of like
really embarrassing.

26:08.016 --> 26:11.083
Don't let it tank your whole
college experience, okay.

26:11.151 --> 26:13.486
So how do they
get this off?

26:13.554 --> 26:15.889
It's like a Brazilian
but for your butt.

26:17.157 --> 26:19.726
I got to take this...

26:19.793 --> 26:21.093
You are being so brave.

26:21.161 --> 26:22.695
Hey what's up?

26:22.763 --> 26:25.330
So it turns out Paval was
watching a movie with his

26:25.331 --> 26:26.999
father the night
of the murder.

26:27.066 --> 26:28.667
We're going to bring
Katja in for questioning.

26:28.735 --> 26:30.502
Can you meet me at IIB?

26:30.570 --> 26:32.170
Yeah sure.

26:32.238 --> 26:33.405
<i>Do you think she
knows something?</i>

26:33.472 --> 26:35.908
Yeah, and we need
to see what that is.

26:35.975 --> 26:37.175
All right.

26:37.243 --> 26:38.276
This thing supposed
to be sinking?

26:38.344 --> 26:42.446
Hang on a
second; I got it.

26:42.514 --> 26:43.915
Oh, oh man.

26:43.982 --> 26:45.249
You all right?

26:45.316 --> 26:47.051
Oh.. are you all right?

26:47.118 --> 26:48.352
My back... My back, my back.

26:48.420 --> 26:49.353
You all right?

26:49.421 --> 26:50.354
What did you do man?

26:50.422 --> 26:51.355
I didn't do anything.

26:51.423 --> 26:52.356
Touched the button?

26:52.424 --> 26:53.357
No.

26:53.425 --> 26:54.592
Come on, this thing...

26:54.660 --> 26:56.226
I know, I know. Come on...

26:56.294 --> 26:57.761
Guys...

26:57.828 --> 27:00.897
The nurse will be
right with you....

27:00.965 --> 27:03.266
Guys!

27:04.501 --> 27:05.735
Hello?

27:09.073 --> 27:11.808
Just touch here if
you can hear me.

27:11.876 --> 27:13.208
All right, I'm ready.

27:15.779 --> 27:18.981
Got yourself in a bit of a
spot here Katja;

27:19.049 --> 27:21.784
you know that don't you?

27:21.851 --> 27:24.352
Yes.

27:29.592 --> 27:32.560
We know that Fyodor
was in love with you.

27:32.628 --> 27:35.463
Was he upset about your
relationship with Dmitri?

27:35.530 --> 27:37.164
Did you two
argue about that?

27:37.232 --> 27:39.333
No!

27:39.401 --> 27:44.371
There were feelings between
us but a different kind.

27:44.439 --> 27:47.674
Dmitri was the one who I
fell in love with and even

27:47.742 --> 27:51.845
then me and Fyodor,
we never fought, never.

27:51.913 --> 27:54.848
Besides he knew that
I'm good for Paval.

27:54.916 --> 27:57.017
If you cared about
Fyodor at all why don't

27:57.085 --> 27:59.019
you just help us get
to the bottom of this?

28:01.521 --> 28:03.089
What happened on the
night of the murder?

28:07.961 --> 28:12.598
Fyodor, Fyodor...

28:15.969 --> 28:17.836
<i>I think she
found the body.</i>

28:19.271 --> 28:25.910
He was already dead when
you found him, wasn't he?

28:27.279 --> 28:30.548
He was laying there,
blood everywhere.

28:34.052 --> 28:35.252
And what happened?

28:40.258 --> 28:41.959
Oh my God!

28:50.233 --> 28:54.436
<i>She may have called
Dmitri to come over.</i>

28:55.272 --> 28:56.806
We've checked Dmitri's
phone records.

28:56.874 --> 29:00.242
He received a call from
Fyodor's that night.

29:00.310 --> 29:03.780
That was you calling
him, wasn't it?

29:03.847 --> 29:05.914
Wasn't it?

29:09.285 --> 29:12.921
He came over and
helped you clean up.

29:12.989 --> 29:15.290
How did he get cut?

29:15.357 --> 29:16.958
He made me do it to him

29:17.026 --> 29:19.494
so it would look
like they fought.

29:22.164 --> 29:23.998
So who actually
killed Fyodor?

29:42.183 --> 29:45.450
<i>It was Paval.</i>

29:45.518 --> 29:49.188
Katja, it was
Paval wasn't it?

29:49.255 --> 29:53.291
He didn't know what he was
doing, I'm sure of it.

30:11.029 --> 30:12.662
No way! The kid?

30:12.730 --> 30:13.897
Yeah.

30:13.964 --> 30:16.399
No wonder Dmitri
took the rap for him.

30:16.466 --> 30:19.769
He'd do anything to protect
him, but I just don't buy it.

30:19.836 --> 30:21.905
Are you going to be able
to make it up the stairs?

30:21.972 --> 30:25.875
Yeah, I'm good,
I'm golden, come on.

30:25.943 --> 30:28.677
So did your uncle every get
through to your autistic cousin?

30:28.745 --> 30:30.645
Yeah, actually he bought
her this universal

30:30.713 --> 30:33.181
calendar, put it up on her
wall and it kind of became

30:33.249 --> 30:36.718
this thing they shared, you
know, like a common ground.

30:36.786 --> 30:37.886
Common ground.

30:37.954 --> 30:40.322
Mr. Bay did you
hurt your back?

30:40.390 --> 30:41.689
Yes sir, a little bit.

30:41.757 --> 30:43.591
Then why haven't you
filled out a 5B or a 7D?

30:43.659 --> 30:45.093
Oh well I don't think
that's necessary.

30:45.161 --> 30:46.227
It's nonsense.

30:46.295 --> 30:47.328
Get down here.

30:47.396 --> 30:48.529
Okay.

30:53.435 --> 30:54.735
Okay we'll try your theory
that there was someone

30:54.803 --> 30:58.906
else in the room
besides Paval.

30:58.974 --> 31:00.474
Let's hope this works.

31:17.349 --> 31:21.218
Hi Paval, it's Toby.

31:21.286 --> 31:23.120
I know everything must be
really strange right now

31:23.188 --> 31:26.490
but I'm going to help you.

31:26.558 --> 31:30.027
I know how much you love
your train set... couldn't

31:30.095 --> 31:33.297
bring everything but I
brought you a few things.

31:33.364 --> 31:34.564
This is a tree.

31:39.236 --> 31:41.771
This is a park bench.

31:43.307 --> 31:46.910
Just like in
your train set.

31:48.312 --> 31:52.848
Now this is you.

31:52.916 --> 31:54.783
You can turn the bench.

31:56.886 --> 32:01.824
And you're going to be
joined by your father.

32:02.993 --> 32:05.128
It's okay, it's all right.

32:06.895 --> 32:08.096
You guys are watching
television just like on

32:08.164 --> 32:09.697
movie night.

32:16.672 --> 32:20.808
The last time you were
watching television

32:20.876 --> 32:24.111
someone came
by, didn't they?

32:26.314 --> 32:28.949
It's okay Paval, it's
okay because this is me.

32:29.017 --> 32:30.184
Look, this is me.

32:31.919 --> 32:34.721
The person who came,
they hurt your father.

32:38.492 --> 32:39.992
What is it Paval?

32:53.407 --> 32:55.274
Look up at them.

32:55.341 --> 32:56.475
It's okay.

32:58.311 --> 32:59.778
Who hurt your father?

33:13.124 --> 33:17.027
Okay. I'll get rid of him.

33:17.095 --> 33:18.929
It's okay, it's safe.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.999
Good work.

33:35.012 --> 33:37.681
There's absolutely nothing that
connects Yuri to the murder.

33:37.748 --> 33:40.383
That's it, see something's
bugging me about my reads.

33:40.451 --> 33:44.320
I think that the statue might
have been wiped down twice.

33:44.387 --> 33:46.189
And you have the
cloth that Dmitri used.

33:46.256 --> 33:48.224
Yeah we collected
it as evidence.

33:48.291 --> 33:49.325
Yuri used another cloth.

33:53.363 --> 33:57.734
You find that cloth and you
connect Yuri to the whole thing.

33:59.168 --> 34:02.204
Hey guys, I think
I got something.

34:02.271 --> 34:05.473
Get this...
I cross-referenced our good

34:05.541 --> 34:07.709
friend Yuri with our
case and I got a hit.

34:07.777 --> 34:10.812
Connecting the dots... two
years ago, Yuri represented

34:10.880 --> 34:13.248
a Sasha Miranov in a case
of living off the avails

34:13.315 --> 34:14.482
of prostitution.

34:14.550 --> 34:15.916
Small world.

34:15.984 --> 34:17.317
Very. And you don't
believe in coincidence.

34:17.385 --> 34:19.820
No, but I
believe in proof.

34:19.888 --> 34:21.621
And what do we have here;
we have an eyewitness who

34:21.688 --> 34:26.960
doesn't communicate with the
world and you... no offense.

34:27.027 --> 34:31.231
So given the circumstances
we, like you, want what's

34:31.297 --> 34:32.697
best for Paval.

34:32.766 --> 34:34.868
You can claim Diplomatic
immunity for him or he can

34:34.935 --> 34:36.268
face trial here.

34:36.335 --> 34:38.972
The crown says they
won't pursue jail time.

34:39.039 --> 34:41.274
So he'd be
institutionalized.

34:41.341 --> 34:42.909
Yeah.

34:42.976 --> 34:45.812
But, we have some great
institutions here in Canada...

34:45.880 --> 34:47.478
I think that would
be preferable.

34:47.545 --> 34:49.313
Dmitri and I would
be able to visit him.

34:49.382 --> 34:51.917
Great.

34:56.422 --> 34:57.756
Thank you for your help.

34:57.824 --> 34:59.992
Any time.

35:04.696 --> 35:08.166
Hey Sarge, want to
go claw fishing?

35:13.806 --> 35:15.106
Mr. Volkov.

35:15.174 --> 35:16.674
Sgt. McCluskey.

35:16.741 --> 35:18.142
You know there are rare
days when a Mountie gets

35:18.210 --> 35:20.443
her man and
wishes she hadn't.

35:20.511 --> 35:22.145
This is one of them.

35:22.213 --> 35:23.613
I appreciate that.

35:23.681 --> 35:26.382
There's just one little
problem I'm having.

35:26.450 --> 35:27.818
What's that?

35:27.885 --> 35:29.986
When forensics examined
the statue for trace

35:30.054 --> 35:34.757
evidence, two different
fibers were found...

35:34.825 --> 35:35.991
two different cloths.

35:36.059 --> 35:39.195
Someone wiped it
down before Dmitri.

35:40.563 --> 35:41.964
What are you implying?

35:42.032 --> 35:47.803
Whoever killed Fyodor
tried to frame Paval.

35:47.871 --> 35:51.172
Don't worry...
our entire team is on it.

35:51.240 --> 35:52.673
We will find him.

35:52.741 --> 35:56.677
Well this is most unexpected
but it gives me hope.

35:56.745 --> 35:57.979
Thank you Sergeant.

36:02.952 --> 36:04.719
You get anything?

36:04.786 --> 36:05.854
Yeah...

36:15.948 --> 36:18.484
Hello Mr. Volkov.

36:18.551 --> 36:19.751
You have news already?

36:19.819 --> 36:21.253
We do.

36:21.321 --> 36:23.955
We found that cloth and
preliminary forensics has

36:24.024 --> 36:27.358
linked it to you.

36:27.426 --> 36:30.995
Preliminary forensics...
so you have nothing.

36:33.365 --> 36:37.035
Why would I harm
the father I loved? Hmm?

36:37.102 --> 36:38.736
Now if you'll excuse me.

36:38.803 --> 36:41.439
Sasha Miranov had a scheme to
bring girls into the country.

36:41.507 --> 36:44.174
He offered to cut you in for
a lot... that sound familiar?

36:44.242 --> 36:46.376
I was his lawyer,
it was legitimate.

36:46.444 --> 36:47.610
Investments.

36:47.678 --> 36:49.312
Yeah but you didn't
have any money.

36:49.380 --> 36:52.315
Bank records show that you were
poaching off your father's account.

36:52.383 --> 36:54.317
I'm guessing he
didn't like that.

36:54.385 --> 36:58.388
You two argued, one
thing led to another...

36:58.456 --> 37:02.625
Look if there are inquires
I will face them in my country.

37:03.693 --> 37:05.394
Are you sure?

37:05.462 --> 37:08.364
You might be a lot better off
in a nice safe Canadian prison.

37:17.540 --> 37:19.774
I didn't mean to hurt him.

37:19.841 --> 37:22.077
It was an accident.

37:22.144 --> 37:23.811
I didn't do
anything criminal.

37:23.879 --> 37:26.414
You killed your father and tried
to frame your autistic brother.

37:26.482 --> 37:31.885
You want to tell
me why that's okay?

37:33.321 --> 37:34.988
Come on.

37:44.466 --> 37:46.266
Here I'll take that.

37:46.334 --> 37:48.434
Oh wait, what's going
on with the slug?

37:48.502 --> 37:50.236
It failed its field test
on a number of issues,

37:50.304 --> 37:53.106
but the biggest one here was
Mr. Bay injuring his back.

37:53.173 --> 37:54.740
Well I mean back injuries
were the whole point of

37:54.808 --> 37:57.042
testing these things in the
first place, am I right?

37:57.111 --> 37:59.378
Ah, oh, still
go the spasms?

37:59.446 --> 38:00.980
Yeah, but they're
getting better sir.

38:01.047 --> 38:04.249
Now always remember,
lift with your legs.

38:04.317 --> 38:05.650
Yes, absolutely.

38:05.718 --> 38:07.119
I'll remember that sir.

38:07.186 --> 38:08.686
Safety first.

38:08.754 --> 38:12.690
Oh, ah!

38:12.758 --> 38:14.359
Us one, slug zero.

38:14.427 --> 38:15.893
You were faking.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.662
Well something had to be
done; that thing was a menace.

38:17.730 --> 38:19.230
I'm sorry to take
advantage of our little

38:19.297 --> 38:21.965
arrangement but I did
what was necessary.

38:22.033 --> 38:24.901
No, no, what was necessary...
me waiting on you hand and foot.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.770
Well, you know, I had
to stay in character.

38:26.838 --> 38:29.840
It's not like I asked you to
give me a sponge bath or anything.

38:30.975 --> 38:31.842
No, I got other
things to do.

38:31.909 --> 38:32.976
What?

38:33.044 --> 38:34.378
What do you have to do?

38:34.446 --> 38:37.046
I've got these other
friends, who need me.

38:37.114 --> 38:39.915
Fine, go... go to your
other friends and...

38:39.983 --> 38:41.551
See you later buddy.

38:47.224 --> 38:49.359
So how is your citizenship

Hello Toby.

A little gift for Paval.

By all means.

I brought you something.

You remember this?

40:04.630 --> 40:06.431
You gotta remember your
father just like that
