WEBVTT

00:44.627 --> 00:47.588
The way we eat
has changed more in the last 50 years

00:47.630 --> 00:49.631
than in the previous 10,000.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.553
But the image that's used
to sell the food,

00:54.596 --> 00:58.474
it is still the imagery
of agrarian America.

01:05.940 --> 01:09.318
You go into the supermarket
and you see pictures of farmers,

01:11.154 --> 01:13.113
the picket fence, the silo,

01:13.156 --> 01:15.324
the '30s farmhouse
and the green grass.

01:17.535 --> 01:20.120
It's the spinning
of this pastoral fantasy.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.006
The modern American
supermarket

01:31.049 --> 01:34.009
has on average
47,000 products.

01:46.397 --> 01:49.066
There are no seasons
in the American supermarket.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.151
Now there are tomatoes
all year round,

01:51.194 --> 01:54.071
grown halfway around the world,
picked when it was green,

01:54.114 --> 01:56.698
and ripened
with ethylene gas.

02:00.411 --> 02:02.037
Although it looks
like a tomato,

02:02.080 --> 02:04.039
it's kind of
a notional tomato.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.416
I mean, it's the idea
of a tomato.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.481
In the meat aisle,
there are no bones anymore.

02:33.945 --> 02:36.155
There is this deliberate veil,

02:36.197 --> 02:38.282
this curtain,
that's dropped between us

02:38.324 --> 02:40.784
and where our food
is coming from.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.704
The industry doesn't want
you to know the truth

02:43.746 --> 02:45.247
about what you're eating,

02:45.290 --> 02:48.250
because if you knew,
you might not want to eat it.

02:51.921 --> 02:53.505
If you follow
the food chain back

02:53.548 --> 02:55.883
from those shrink-wrapped
packages of meat,

02:55.925 --> 02:58.218
you find a very
different reality.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.137
The reality is a factory.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.264
It's not a farm.
It's a factory.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.266
That meat is
being processed

03:04.309 --> 03:07.394
by huge multinational
corporations

03:07.437 --> 03:10.439
that have very little to do
with ranches and farmers.

03:10.481 --> 03:14.818
Now our food is coming
from enormous assembly lines

03:14.861 --> 03:18.697
where the animals and the workers are
being abused.

03:20.116 --> 03:22.492
And the food has become
much more dangerous

03:22.535 --> 03:25.996
in ways that are being
deliberately hidden from us.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.499
You've got a small group
of multinational corporations

03:29.542 --> 03:32.419
who control
the entire food system.

03:33.671 --> 03:35.380
From seed
to the supermarket,

03:35.423 --> 03:37.424
they're gaining
control of food.

03:39.427 --> 03:42.054
This isn't just about what we're eating.

03:42.096 --> 03:44.681
This is about what
we're allowed to say,

03:44.724 --> 03:46.808
what we're allowed
to know.

03:46.851 --> 03:49.228
It's not just our health
that's at risk.

03:49.270 --> 03:52.940
The companies don't
want farmers talking.

03:52.982 --> 03:56.318
They don't want
this story told.

04:16.297 --> 04:18.673
How about a nice chicken club sandwich
made with fresh cooked chicken?

04:18.716 --> 04:21.385
You know,
that's a nice idea,

04:21.427 --> 04:23.387
but I think what
I'd really like

04:23.429 --> 04:26.098
- is a burger.
- All right.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.520
My favorite meal to this day

04:31.562 --> 04:33.855
remains a hamburger
and french fries.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.903
I had no idea that
a handful of companies

04:39.946 --> 04:42.864
had changed what we eat
and how we make our food.

04:46.202 --> 04:48.161
I've been eating
this food all my life

04:48.204 --> 04:50.247
without having any idea
where it comes from,

04:50.290 --> 04:53.292
any idea how powerful
this industry is.

04:53.334 --> 04:55.335
And it was the idea

04:55.378 --> 04:59.256
of this world deliberately
hidden from us.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.258
I think that's one
of the reasons why

05:01.301 --> 05:03.260
I became
an investigative reporter,

05:03.303 --> 05:06.179
was to take the veil--
lift the veil away

05:06.222 --> 05:09.975
from important subjects
that are being hidden.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.981
The whole industrial food system

05:16.024 --> 05:18.358
really began
with fast food.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.652
In the 1930s,

05:20.695 --> 05:22.404
a new form
of restaurant arose

05:22.447 --> 05:24.448
and it was called
the drive-in.

05:27.493 --> 05:30.329
The McDonald brothers had
a very successful drive-in,

05:30.371 --> 05:34.541
but they decided
to cut costs and simplify.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.793
So they fired
all their carhops,

05:36.836 --> 05:39.129
they got rid of most
of the things on the menu

05:39.172 --> 05:41.715
and they created
a revolutionary idea

05:41.758 --> 05:43.633
to how to run
a restaurant.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.178
They basically brought
the factory system

05:46.220 --> 05:48.764
to the back
of the restaurant kitchen.

05:52.143 --> 05:55.187
They trained each worker
to just do one thing

05:55.229 --> 05:57.689
again and again
and again.

06:00.026 --> 06:03.153
By having workers
who only had to do one thing,

06:03.196 --> 06:05.322
they could pay them
a low wage

06:05.365 --> 06:08.742
and it was very easy
to find someone to replace them.

06:08.785 --> 06:12.662
It was inexpensive food,
it tasted good

06:12.705 --> 06:15.957
and this McDonald's
fast food restaurant

06:16.000 --> 06:18.502
was a huge
huge success.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.716
That mentality
of uniformity,

06:24.759 --> 06:26.718
conformity
and cheapness

06:26.761 --> 06:29.179
applied widely
and on a large scale

06:29.222 --> 06:32.140
has all kinds of
unintended consequences.

06:36.604 --> 06:39.272
When McDonald's is
the largest purchaser

06:39.315 --> 06:41.733
of ground beef
in the United States

06:41.776 --> 06:43.735
and they want
their hamburgers

06:43.778 --> 06:46.113
to taste, everywhere,
exactly the same,

06:46.155 --> 06:49.032
they change how
ground beef is produced.

06:53.204 --> 06:55.163
The McDonald's corporation

06:55.206 --> 06:57.582
is the largest purchaser
of potatoes

06:57.625 --> 07:00.502
and one of the largest
purchasers of pork,

07:00.545 --> 07:04.256
chicken, tomatoes,
lettuce, even apples.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.467
These big big
fast food chains

07:07.510 --> 07:09.469
want big suppliers.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.389
And now there are essentially
a handful of companies

07:12.432 --> 07:14.224
controlling
our food system.

07:22.066 --> 07:25.026
In the 1970s,
the top five beef-packers

07:25.069 --> 07:27.988
controlled only
about 25% of the market.

07:28.030 --> 07:30.866
Today, the top four

07:30.908 --> 07:33.535
control more than 80%
of the market.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.498
You see the same thing
happening now in pork.

07:40.918 --> 07:43.211
Even if you don't eat
at a fast food restaurant,

07:43.254 --> 07:46.590
you're now eating meat
that's being produced

07:46.632 --> 07:49.259
by this system.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.556
You look at the labels

07:54.599 --> 07:56.391
and you see Farmer this,
Farmer that--

07:56.434 --> 07:59.603
it's really just
three or four companies

07:59.645 --> 08:02.439
that are controlling
the meat.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.650
We've never had
food companies this big

08:05.693 --> 08:08.195
and this powerful
in our history.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.197
Tyson, for example,

08:10.239 --> 08:13.909
is the biggest meat-packing company
in the history of the world.

08:13.951 --> 08:17.621
The industry changed the entire way that
chicken are raised.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.750
Birds are now raised
and slaughtered

08:21.792 --> 08:24.336
in half the time
they were 50 years ago,

08:24.378 --> 08:26.087
but now they're
twice as big.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.632
People like to eat
white meat,

08:28.674 --> 08:31.092
so they redesigned
the chicken

08:31.135 --> 08:33.135
to have large breasts.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.933
They not only changed the chicken,

08:37.975 --> 08:39.893
they changed the farmer.

08:41.437 --> 08:44.147
Today, chicken farmers
no longer control their birds.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.984
A company like Tyson

08:48.027 --> 08:50.820
owns the birds from
the day they're dropped off

08:50.863 --> 08:52.822
until the day that
they're slaughtered.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.660
Let me go to the top.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.287
- This is the Chicken--
- National Chicken Council.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.290
The chicken industry
has really set a model

09:02.333 --> 09:05.043
for the integration
of production, processing

09:05.086 --> 09:06.628
and marketing
of the products

09:06.671 --> 09:09.297
that other industries
are now following

09:09.340 --> 09:12.342
because they see that we have achieved
tremendous economies.

09:17.306 --> 09:19.182
In a way, we're not
producing chickens;

09:19.225 --> 09:20.934
we're producing food.

09:22.186 --> 09:23.812
It's all highly mechanized.

09:23.854 --> 09:26.189
So all the birds
coming off those farms

09:26.232 --> 09:28.567
have to be almost
exactly the same size.

09:31.529 --> 09:34.990
What the system of intensive
production accomplishes

09:35.032 --> 09:38.785
is to produce
a lot of food

09:38.828 --> 09:41.162
on a small amount of land

09:41.205 --> 09:43.748
at a very affordable price.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.126
Now somebody explain to me
what's wrong with that.

10:04.395 --> 10:07.022
Smells like money to me.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.655
16 chicken houses
sit here.

10:15.698 --> 10:19.701
And Chuck's son has
four over the top of this hill.

10:19.744 --> 10:23.371
The chicken industry
came in here

10:23.414 --> 10:26.499
and it's helped
this whole community out.

10:32.590 --> 10:35.175
Here's my chicken
houses here.

10:37.511 --> 10:39.888
I have about
300,000 chickens.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.520
What do you want?

10:49.774 --> 10:52.359
We have a contract
with Tyson.

10:52.401 --> 10:55.820
They've been growing chickens
for many many years.

10:55.863 --> 10:58.657
It's all a science.
They got it figured out.

10:58.699 --> 11:02.077
If you can grow
a chicken in 49 days,

11:02.119 --> 11:04.454
why would you want one you gotta grow
in three months?

11:06.165 --> 11:07.832
More money
in your pocket.

11:15.549 --> 11:18.426
These chickens
never see sunlight.

11:18.469 --> 11:21.721
They're pretty much
in the dark all the time.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.827
So you think they just
want to keep us out?

11:43.869 --> 11:45.870
I don't know.

11:45.913 --> 11:48.206
If I knew,
I'd tell you.

11:48.249 --> 11:52.043
It would be nice if y'all could see
what we really do,

11:52.086 --> 11:55.171
but as far
as y'all going in,

11:55.214 --> 11:57.424
we can't let you
do that.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.276
I understand why farmers
don't want to talk--

12:16.318 --> 12:18.737
because the company can
do what it wants to do

12:18.779 --> 12:21.865
as far as pay goes
since they control everything.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.743
But it's just gotten
to the point

12:24.785 --> 12:27.829
that it's not right
what's going on

12:27.872 --> 12:29.831
and I've just
made up my mind.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.458
I'm gonna say
what I have to say.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.877
I understand why others
don't want to do it.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.129
And I'm just to a point

12:36.172 --> 12:37.756
that it doesn't
matter anymore.

12:37.798 --> 12:40.091
Something has
to be said.

12:54.356 --> 12:55.982
It is nasty in here.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.401
There's dust
flying everywhere.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.111
There's feces
everywhere.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.572
This isn't farming.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.449
This is just
mass production,

13:04.492 --> 13:06.826
like an assembly line
in a factory.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.456
When they grow
from a chick

13:11.499 --> 13:14.292
and in seven weeks you've
got a five-and-a-half- pound chicken,

13:14.335 --> 13:16.795
their bones
and their internal organs

13:16.837 --> 13:18.797
can't keep up
with the rapid growth.

13:18.839 --> 13:22.550
A lot of these chickens here,
they can take a few steps

13:22.593 --> 13:25.637
and then they plop down.
It's because they can't

13:25.679 --> 13:28.056
keep up all the weight
that they're carrying.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.596
That's normal.

14:12.059 --> 14:14.561
There's antibiotics
that's put into the feed

14:14.603 --> 14:16.896
and of course that passes
through the chicken.

14:16.939 --> 14:20.108
The bacteria
builds up a resistance,

14:20.150 --> 14:22.735
so antibiotics
aren't working anymore.

14:22.778 --> 14:25.738
I have become allergic
to all antibiotics

14:25.781 --> 14:27.448
and can't take 'em.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.002
When it's dark inside the houses,

14:39.044 --> 14:42.213
the chickens lay down.
It's less resistance

14:42.256 --> 14:44.007
when they're
being caught.

14:47.386 --> 14:51.222
Traditionally, it's been
African-American men.

14:52.725 --> 14:56.895
Now we're seeing more
and more Latino catchers--

14:58.397 --> 15:00.356
undocumented workers.

15:00.399 --> 15:03.359
From their point of view,
they don't have any rights

15:03.402 --> 15:05.111
and they're just not
gonna complain.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.822
The companies like
these kind of workers.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.951
It doesn't matter
if the chickens get sick.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.953
All of the chickens
will go to the plant

15:13.996 --> 15:15.914
for processing.

15:35.392 --> 15:38.728
The companies keep
the farmers under their thumb

15:38.771 --> 15:40.939
because of the debt
that the farmers have.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.567
To build one poultry house

15:44.610 --> 15:49.322
is anywhere from $280,000
to $300,000 per house.

15:49.365 --> 15:52.742
And once you make
your initial investment,

15:52.785 --> 15:54.744
the companies
constantly come back

15:54.787 --> 15:56.454
with demands
of upgrades

15:56.497 --> 15:58.456
for new equipment,

15:58.499 --> 16:00.458
and the grower
has no choice.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.126
They have to do it

16:02.169 --> 16:04.587
or you're threatened
with loss of a contract.

16:07.716 --> 16:10.301
This is how they keep
the farmers under control.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.762
It's how they keep them
spending money,

16:12.805 --> 16:14.764
going to the bank
and borrowing more money.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.058
The debt just
keeps building.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.896
To have no say
in your business,

16:21.939 --> 16:23.898
it's degrading.

16:23.941 --> 16:27.151
It's like being
a slave to the company.

17:16.492 --> 17:18.661
The idea that you would
need to write a book

17:18.704 --> 17:20.663
telling people
where their food came from

17:20.705 --> 17:22.623
is just a sign of how far removed
we've become.

17:22.665 --> 17:26.836
It seems to me that we're entitled
to know about our food--

17:26.878 --> 17:29.881
"Who owns it?
How are they making it?

17:29.923 --> 17:31.799
Can I have a look
in the kitchen?"

17:36.013 --> 17:38.598
When I wanted to understand
the industrial food system,

17:38.640 --> 17:41.476
what I set about doing
was very simple.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.436
I wanted to trace
the source of my food.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.440
When you go through
the supermarket,

17:47.483 --> 17:51.611
what looks like this cornucopia
of variety and choice is not.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.279
There is an illusion
of diversity.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.364
There are only
a few companies involved

17:55.407 --> 17:56.908
and there're
only a few crops involved.

17:58.744 --> 18:01.037
What really
surprised me most

18:01.080 --> 18:03.748
as I followed that food
back to its source,

18:03.791 --> 18:05.917
I kept ending up
in the same place,

18:05.959 --> 18:08.002
and that was
a cornfield in Iowa.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.547
So much of our
industrial food

18:11.590 --> 18:15.051
turns out to be clever
rearrangements of corn.

18:21.725 --> 18:24.352
Corn has conquered the world
in a lot of ways.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.189
It is a remarkable plant.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.067
100 years ago,
a farmer in America

18:31.110 --> 18:34.278
could grow maybe 20 bushels of corn
on an acre.

18:34.321 --> 18:37.824
Today, 200 bushels
is no problem.

18:37.866 --> 18:40.368
That's an astonishing
achievement

18:40.410 --> 18:42.370
for which breeders
deserve credit,

18:42.412 --> 18:44.872
for which fertilizer
makers deserve credit,

18:44.915 --> 18:47.500
for which pesticide makers
all deserve credit.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.633
In the United States today,

18:55.676 --> 18:58.761
30% of our land base
is being planted to corn.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.766
That's largely driven
by government policy,

19:03.809 --> 19:05.768
government policy that,
in effect,

19:05.811 --> 19:09.272
allows us to produce corn
below the cost of production.

19:09.314 --> 19:13.484
The truth of the matter is
we're paid to overproduce,

19:13.527 --> 19:15.486
and it was caused by

19:15.529 --> 19:17.655
these large
multinational interests.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.950
The reason our government's
promoting corn--

19:20.993 --> 19:24.996
the Cargills, the ADMs,
Tyson, Smithfield--

19:25.038 --> 19:27.957
they have an interest in purchasing corn
below the cost of production.

19:29.710 --> 19:33.796
They use that interest and that
extensive amount of money they have

19:33.839 --> 19:37.341
to lobby Congress to give us the kind
of farm bills we now have.

19:38.343 --> 19:39.760
A "farm bill,"

19:39.803 --> 19:41.679
which should really be
called a "food bill,"

19:41.722 --> 19:45.516
codifies the rules
of the entire food economy.

19:45.559 --> 19:48.728
Farm policy is always focused
on these commodity crops

19:48.770 --> 19:51.606
because you can
store them.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.819
We encourage farmers to grow
as much corn as they can grow,

19:56.862 --> 20:00.198
to get big,
to consolidate.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.201
We subsidize farmers
by the bushel.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.121
We produced a lot of corn

20:07.164 --> 20:09.165
and they came up
with uses for it.

20:11.668 --> 20:15.338
We are now engineering our foods.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.340
We know where to turn to
for certain traits

20:17.382 --> 20:19.217
like mouth feel and flavor.

20:19.259 --> 20:21.344
And we bring all of these
pieces together

20:21.386 --> 20:24.263
and engineer new foods

20:24.306 --> 20:26.599
that don't stale
in the refrigerator,

20:26.642 --> 20:29.018
don't develop rancidity.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.647
Of course the biggest advance
in recent years

20:32.689 --> 20:34.273
was high-fructose
corn syrup.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.360
You know,
I would venture to guess

20:37.402 --> 20:39.862
if you go and look
on the supermarket shelf,

20:39.905 --> 20:41.864
I'll bet you 90% of them

20:41.907 --> 20:44.867
would contain either
a corn or soybean ingredient,

20:44.910 --> 20:47.370
and most of the time
will contain both.

21:04.972 --> 21:06.555
Corn is the great raw material.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.517
You get that big fat
kernel of starch

21:09.559 --> 21:12.103
and you can break that down
and reassemble it.

21:12.145 --> 21:14.105
You can make
high-fructose corn syrup.

21:14.147 --> 21:15.731
You can make maltodextrin

21:15.774 --> 21:18.567
and diglycerides
and xanthan gum

21:18.610 --> 21:20.569
and ascorbic acid.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.072
All those obscure ingredients
on the processed food--

21:23.115 --> 21:26.242
it's remarkable how many of them can be
made from corn.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.202
Plus, you can feed it
to animals.

21:28.245 --> 21:32.623
Corn is the main component
in feed ingredients

21:32.666 --> 21:36.794
whether it's chicken,
hogs, cattle-- you name it.

21:36.837 --> 21:39.046
Increasingly, we're feeding
the corn to the fish

21:39.089 --> 21:41.757
whether we're eating the tilapia
or the farmed salmon.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.801
We're teaching fish
how to eat corn.

21:47.764 --> 21:50.433
The fact that we had
so much cheap corn

21:50.475 --> 21:54.729
really allowed us to drive
down the price of meat.

21:54.771 --> 21:57.815
I mean, the average American
is eating over 200 lbs

21:57.858 --> 22:00.109
of meat per person
per year.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.111
That wouldn't
be possible

22:02.154 --> 22:04.155
had we not fed them
this diet of cheap grain.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.329
Since you're selling corn
at below the price of production,

22:11.371 --> 22:14.874
the feedlot operator
can buy corn

22:14.916 --> 22:16.876
at a fraction
of what it costs to grow,

22:16.918 --> 22:20.129
so that all the animals
are sucked off

22:20.172 --> 22:22.173
of all the farms
in the Midwest.

22:25.218 --> 22:27.386
There is a spiderweb

22:27.429 --> 22:30.014
of roads
and train tracks

22:30.057 --> 22:32.224
all around the country
moving corn

22:32.267 --> 22:34.894
from where it's being grown
to these CAFOs.

22:41.777 --> 22:44.487
Cows are not designed
by evolution to eat corn.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.947
They're designed
by evolution to eat grass.

22:46.990 --> 22:49.700
And the only reason
we feed them corn

22:49.743 --> 22:51.327
is because corn is
really cheap

22:51.370 --> 22:53.621
and corn makes them
fat quickly.

23:04.424 --> 23:06.175
Where are you putting your hand?

23:06.218 --> 23:09.595
I'm actually
inside the rumen--

23:09.638 --> 23:12.390
that first compartment
of the stomach.

23:14.267 --> 23:16.227
And it's--

23:16.269 --> 23:18.229
it's not--

23:18.271 --> 23:20.147
it's kind of hard to see.

23:20.190 --> 23:23.192
You can see
the liquid part here.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.778
Wow.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.863
- Does that hurt the cow?
- No.

23:29.157 --> 23:30.950
There's microorganisms--

23:30.992 --> 23:33.244
bacteria in the rumen,
millions of 'em.

23:33.286 --> 23:35.955
The animals evolved

23:35.997 --> 23:38.457
on consuming grass.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.459
There's some research
that indicates

23:40.502 --> 23:43.712
that a high-corn diet
results in

23:43.755 --> 23:47.591
E. coli that are
acid-resistant.

23:47.634 --> 23:50.928
And these would be
the more harmful E. coli.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.643
So you feed corn to cattle

23:57.686 --> 24:01.730
and E. coli, which is a very
common bug, evolves,

24:01.773 --> 24:05.067
a certain
mutation occurs

24:05.110 --> 24:09.238
and a strain called
the "E. coli 0157:h7"

24:09.281 --> 24:12.074
appears on
the world stage.

24:12.117 --> 24:15.744
And it's a product of the diet
we're feeding cattle on feedlots

24:15.787 --> 24:18.122
and it's a product
of feedlot life.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.084
The animals
stand ankle deep

24:22.127 --> 24:25.296
in their manure
all day long.

24:25.338 --> 24:27.298
So if one cow has it,

24:27.340 --> 24:28.883
the other cows
will get it.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.595
When they get
to the slaughterhouse,

24:32.637 --> 24:34.930
their hides are
caked with manure.

24:34.973 --> 24:37.308
And if the slaughterhouse
is slaughtering

24:37.350 --> 24:39.018
400 animals an hour,

24:39.060 --> 24:41.687
how do you keep
that manure

24:41.730 --> 24:43.647
from getting
onto those carcasses?

24:43.690 --> 24:46.484
And that's how the manure
gets in the meat.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.862
And now this thing
that wasn't in the world

24:49.905 --> 24:51.489
is in the food system.

25:02.209 --> 25:04.835
A fast-food nightmare
may be getting worse.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.879
A two-year-old child died
today in Seattle.

25:06.922 --> 25:10.216
And the killer? Tainted meat from
Jack In The Box hamburgers.

25:10.258 --> 25:11.842
A nationwide recall today

25:11.885 --> 25:14.470
for more than 140 tons
of ground beef.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.805
A half a million pounds of ground beef--

25:16.848 --> 25:20.059
Today, nationwide recalls
of Con Agra ground beef.

25:20.101 --> 25:23.145
E. coli isn't just in ground beef now--

25:23.188 --> 25:25.981
it's been found
in spinach, apple juice--

25:26.024 --> 25:30.819
and this is really because of the runoff
from our factory farms.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.489
90 confirmed cases
of E. coli poisoning.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.824
Central to it all--
raw, bagged spinach.

25:35.867 --> 25:38.661
This is the 20th
E. coli outbreak with leafy greens

25:38.703 --> 25:40.329
in just the last decade.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.998
For years during
the Bush administration,

25:43.041 --> 25:45.042
the chief of staff
at the USDA

25:45.085 --> 25:47.503
was the former
chief lobbyist

25:47.546 --> 25:49.547
to the beef industry
in Washington;

25:49.589 --> 25:53.676
the head of the F.D.A. was
the former executive vice president

25:53.718 --> 25:56.679
of the National
Food Processors Association.

25:56.721 --> 25:58.597
These regulatory agencies

25:58.640 --> 26:00.933
are being controlled
by the very companies

26:00.976 --> 26:02.685
that they're supposed
to be scrutinizing.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.354
ConAgra, which recently
recalled peanut butter

26:05.397 --> 26:07.106
contaminated
with salmonella,

26:07.148 --> 26:10.317
was aware of problems
in its plant two years ago.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.330
There's always been food poisoning.

26:23.373 --> 26:25.958
As more and more
technology

26:26.001 --> 26:28.002
is being applied
to the production of food,

26:28.044 --> 26:30.004
you would think
it would be getting safer,

26:30.046 --> 26:31.547
not more contaminated.

26:31.590 --> 26:34.508
But the processing plants
have gotten bigger and bigger.

26:34.551 --> 26:38.512
it's just perfect
for taking bad pathogens

26:38.555 --> 26:40.806
and spreading them
far and wide.

26:40.849 --> 26:43.684
The recall of frozen
hamburger now includes

26:43.727 --> 26:45.394
22 million pounds.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.938
Enough meat to make
a fast-food hamburger

26:47.981 --> 26:51.609
for every adult in America
is being recalled.

26:51.651 --> 26:53.611
In the 1970s,
there were literally thousands

26:53.653 --> 26:56.113
of slaughterhouses
in the United States.

26:56.156 --> 26:59.033
Today we have
13 slaughterhouses

26:59.075 --> 27:02.202
that process
the majority of beef

27:02.245 --> 27:04.413
that is sold
in the United States.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.540
The hamburger of today,

27:06.583 --> 27:10.419
it has pieces of thousands
of different cattle

27:10.462 --> 27:12.713
ground up in that
one hamburger patty.

27:12.756 --> 27:17.134
The odds increase exponentially
that one of those animals

27:17.177 --> 27:19.803
was carrying
a dangerous pathogen.

27:19.846 --> 27:23.349
It's remarkable
how toothless

27:23.391 --> 27:27.227
our regulatory agencies are
when you look closely at it,

27:27.270 --> 27:29.146
and that's how
the industry wants it.

27:38.448 --> 27:42.117
This is the USDA
building up here.

27:42.160 --> 27:45.579
Did Josh say how much time
he thought we'd get?

27:45.622 --> 27:47.289
- Five minutes.
- Five minutes.

27:47.332 --> 27:50.709
Well, maybe as much as 15.
Got to be on time for that meeting.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.920
- It starts a 4:00.
- Okay.

27:52.962 --> 27:55.798
So if I start
going like that

27:55.840 --> 27:59.176
- or start shuffling papers, it's time.
- I know, it's time.

27:59.219 --> 28:02.054
Thank you!
Thank you.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.684
I'm a registered Republican.

28:06.726 --> 28:09.436
I've always been
fairly conservative.

28:09.479 --> 28:12.272
I never thought
I would be doing this

28:12.315 --> 28:14.274
and I certainly never
thought I would be

28:14.317 --> 28:16.276
working so closely
with my mom.

28:16.319 --> 28:18.404
- We go this way? Okay.
- Yes, we go this way.

28:18.446 --> 28:21.073
Made a mistake--
I think that's the way we want to go.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.826
My mom and I,
our relationship has

28:23.868 --> 28:26.453
taken on
a whole new dimension.

28:26.496 --> 28:28.872
2421? 2421.

28:28.915 --> 28:30.666
Here we are.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.549
- Hi.
- Hello.

28:38.591 --> 28:40.634
- How are you?
- I'm Pat.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.803
- Hi, Pat.
- Barb Kowalcyk.

28:42.846 --> 28:46.223
- Hi, Barb.
- After the first big push

28:46.266 --> 28:50.102
to establish food standards,
people just got complacent.

28:50.145 --> 28:53.397
We reduced funding
for the FDA.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.649
We've relied increasingly

28:55.692 --> 28:58.485
on self-policing for all
of these industries.

28:58.528 --> 29:01.572
And now
we just have, really,

29:01.614 --> 29:05.033
lost our system.

29:05.076 --> 29:08.495
You're really one
of the champions on the hill

29:08.538 --> 29:10.664
for food safety and it's a very
important cause.

29:10.707 --> 29:14.501
It's very personal
to me and my family.

29:14.544 --> 29:18.672
Our food safety advocacy
work started six years ago

29:18.715 --> 29:21.508
when my two-and-
a-half-year-old son Kevin

29:21.551 --> 29:25.596
was stricken
with E. coli 0157:h7

29:25.638 --> 29:28.974
and went from being
a perfectly healthy

29:29.017 --> 29:31.101
beautiful little boy--

29:31.144 --> 29:33.437
and I have a small picture
with me today

29:33.480 --> 29:36.315
that was taken two weeks
before he got sick.

29:36.357 --> 29:40.068
He went from that
to being dead in 12 days.

29:44.824 --> 29:46.909
In July 2001,

29:46.951 --> 29:49.286
our family took
a vacation.

29:49.329 --> 29:51.997
Had we known what was
in store for us,

29:52.040 --> 29:53.916
we would have
never gone home.

29:56.252 --> 30:00.214
We ended up eating three hamburgers
before he got sick.

30:01.591 --> 30:05.886
We started to see blood
in Kevin's diarrhea,

30:05.929 --> 30:09.223
so we took him
to the emergency room.

30:09.265 --> 30:11.600
And they said,
"We've gotten

30:11.643 --> 30:14.603
the culture back
from Kevin's stool,

30:14.646 --> 30:17.898
and he has
hemorrhagic E. coli."

30:20.276 --> 30:22.569
They came in
and informed us

30:22.612 --> 30:24.905
that Kevin's kidneys were
starting to fail.

30:26.241 --> 30:29.618
Kevin received
his first dialysis treatment.

30:31.287 --> 30:34.164
He was not allowed
to really drink water.

30:34.207 --> 30:37.459
We had these
little sponges

30:37.502 --> 30:40.671
and we were allowed to dip that
into a cup of water

30:40.713 --> 30:42.923
and then give him that.

30:45.802 --> 30:50.556
He bit the head off
of one of them.

30:50.598 --> 30:53.475
You've never seen
someone beg.

30:53.518 --> 30:57.187
He begged for water.
It was all he could talk about.

30:57.230 --> 31:00.607
They wouldn't let anybody
bring any beverage into the room

31:00.650 --> 31:03.735
because-- I mean, it was
all he would talk about,

31:03.778 --> 31:06.822
was... water.

31:10.660 --> 31:13.620
I don't know if he knew
what was happening to him...

31:16.124 --> 31:18.208
and I hope--
I don't know.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.754
To watch
this beautiful child go

31:22.797 --> 31:26.049
from being perfectly healthy
to dead in 12 days--

31:26.092 --> 31:28.302
it was just unbelievable

31:28.344 --> 31:32.306
that this could happen
from eating food.

31:33.516 --> 31:36.727
What was kind of adding
more insult to injury--

31:36.769 --> 31:39.229
it took us almost
two or three years

31:39.272 --> 31:40.981
and hiring
a private attorney

31:41.024 --> 31:43.150
to actually find out that
we matched a meat recall.

31:43.192 --> 31:46.653
On August 1st, my son was already
in the hospital.

31:46.696 --> 31:50.115
They did an E. coli test
at the plant that was positive.

31:50.158 --> 31:52.034
They didn't end up
recalling that meat

31:52.076 --> 31:54.953
until August 27th,

31:54.996 --> 31:57.497
16 days after he died.

31:57.540 --> 32:00.542
If we have some more hearings--
which I'm sure we will--

32:00.585 --> 32:02.669
I'd love to have
you come and testify.

32:02.712 --> 32:05.714
- Keep fighting.
- Thank you. You too.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.216
You never get over
the death of your child.

32:08.259 --> 32:11.678
You find a new normal.

32:11.721 --> 32:13.263
- This way?
- Yes.

32:13.306 --> 32:15.474
- We're going this way?
- Mm-hmm.

32:15.516 --> 32:17.267
We put faith in our government

32:17.310 --> 32:19.811
to protect us,

32:19.854 --> 32:22.189
and we're not
being protected

32:22.231 --> 32:24.066
at a most basic level.

32:27.070 --> 32:31.365
In 1998, the USDA implemented
microbial testing

32:31.407 --> 32:35.285
for salmonella
and E. coli 0157:h7.

32:37.580 --> 32:42.209
The idea was that if a plant
repeatedly failed these tests,

32:42.251 --> 32:43.961
that the USDA would
shut the plant down

32:44.003 --> 32:47.297
because they obviously had an ongoing
contamination problem.

32:48.716 --> 32:50.550
The meat
and poultry associations

32:50.593 --> 32:52.844
immediately took
the USDA to court.

32:54.055 --> 32:56.098
The courts
basically said

32:56.140 --> 32:58.016
the USDA didn't have
the authority

32:58.059 --> 33:00.060
to shut down the plants.

33:00.103 --> 33:02.062
What it meant was that

33:02.105 --> 33:05.315
you could have a pound
of meat or poultry products

33:05.358 --> 33:08.777
that is a petri dish
of salmonella

33:08.820 --> 33:11.780
and the USDA
really can't do anything about it.

33:15.034 --> 33:18.286
A new law was introduced
in direct response

33:18.329 --> 33:21.581
and this law became known
as Kevin's Law.

33:33.011 --> 33:37.931
It seems like such a clear-cut,
common sense type thing.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.933
- How are things going?
- Fine fine.

33:39.976 --> 33:41.685
We've been working for six years

33:41.728 --> 33:43.770
and it still
hasn't passed.

33:43.813 --> 33:46.189
I sense that
there may be

33:46.232 --> 33:48.483
an opportunity--
an enhanced opportunity--

33:48.526 --> 33:50.444
to get this signed
into law this time.

33:50.486 --> 33:53.113
I think that from the standpoint
of the consumer,

33:53.156 --> 33:55.407
a lot of people would
support the idea

33:55.450 --> 33:58.452
of paying a little more
if they could be guaranteed

33:58.494 --> 34:01.038
a higher standard
of safety.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.248
- Yeah.
- But I also know

34:03.291 --> 34:04.916
that there are
other players

34:04.959 --> 34:07.794
- in the food production chain...
- We know.

34:07.837 --> 34:10.255
...that tend
to worry about that,

34:10.297 --> 34:13.007
because it's gonna be seen as an add-on
to their costs.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.342
I think
the advantage here is--

34:15.386 --> 34:17.471
Sometimes it does feel like

34:17.513 --> 34:20.639
industry was more protected
than my son.

34:20.683 --> 34:24.770
That's what motivated me
to become an advocate.

34:24.812 --> 34:27.188
In the past year alone,
there have been

34:27.231 --> 34:29.190
a multitude of food-borne
illness outbreaks

34:29.233 --> 34:31.650
which have resulted
in significant losses.

34:31.694 --> 34:33.820
Clearly
our current approach

34:33.862 --> 34:35.572
to food oversight
and protection

34:35.614 --> 34:38.074
is not meeting the needs
of American families.

34:44.040 --> 34:46.917
It's really hard for me
to tell Kevin's story.

34:49.962 --> 34:51.922
But the only way
I'm going to be able

34:51.964 --> 34:53.799
to prevent it from happening
to other people

34:53.841 --> 34:57.677
is to go out there
and speak about it.

35:01.724 --> 35:03.475
Yeah.

35:07.563 --> 35:10.857
Six are elementary school students,
one is a sibling,

35:10.900 --> 35:12.692
and there's another one
in another county

35:12.735 --> 35:14.402
in Kentucky, so...

35:18.282 --> 35:20.700
It will be seven years

35:20.743 --> 35:23.078
since my son died.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.998
All I wanted
the company to do

35:27.041 --> 35:28.959
was say "We're sorry.

35:29.001 --> 35:31.044
We produced
this defective product

35:31.087 --> 35:33.296
that killed your child,
and this is what

35:33.339 --> 35:36.091
we're going to do to make sure
it doesn't happen again."

35:36.134 --> 35:38.760
That's all we wanted,

35:38.803 --> 35:40.971
and they couldn't
give us that.

35:51.107 --> 35:53.525
The industrial food system
is always looking

35:53.568 --> 35:56.820
for greater efficiency,
but each new step in efficiency

35:56.863 --> 35:59.072
leads to problems.

35:59.115 --> 36:02.868
If you take feedlot cattle off
of their corn diet,

36:02.910 --> 36:04.911
give them grass
for five days,

36:04.954 --> 36:07.831
they will shed 80% of the E. coli
in their gut.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.708
But of course that's not what
the industry does.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.168
The industry's approach is--

36:11.210 --> 36:13.587
when it has a systematic
problem like that--

36:13.629 --> 36:16.673
is not to go back and see
what's wrong with the system,

36:16.716 --> 36:20.135
it's to come up some high-tech fixes
that allow the system to survive.

36:29.812 --> 36:31.730
The 5x5 product surge tank--

36:31.772 --> 36:33.732
low level. Low level.

36:36.444 --> 36:38.236
This is our operations center.

36:38.279 --> 36:40.488
We control all
of our plants from here.

36:40.531 --> 36:42.449
Where's Chicago?
Here's Chicago,

36:42.491 --> 36:44.951
Georgia, Utah, Kansas,

36:44.994 --> 36:48.371
Nebraska,
Texas, L.A., Ohio.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.459
We control all levels
of the gearboxes,

36:52.501 --> 36:54.127
the speed of motors--

36:54.170 --> 36:56.213
we can change
those all from here.

37:04.388 --> 37:06.348
We built something that--

37:06.390 --> 37:08.183
from a food-safety
standpoint,

37:08.226 --> 37:10.477
we think we're
ahead of everybody.

37:10.519 --> 37:13.980
We think we can lessen
the incidents

37:14.023 --> 37:16.358
of E. coli 0157:h7.

37:18.402 --> 37:20.487
But I just started
working with ammonia

37:20.529 --> 37:22.239
and ammonia hydroxide.

37:23.532 --> 37:25.992
Ammonia kills bacteria,

37:26.035 --> 37:29.162
so it became
a processing tool.

37:41.175 --> 37:43.009
I'm really a mechanic.

37:43.052 --> 37:44.886
That's really what I am.

37:44.929 --> 37:47.514
We design
our own machinery.

38:11.497 --> 38:13.498
This is our finished product.

38:24.593 --> 38:27.304
Is your meat in most
of the hamburgers in the country?

38:27.346 --> 38:29.306
70%.

38:29.348 --> 38:32.934
In five years,
we think we'll be in 100%.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.936
We do have
some competitors.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.230
I think
we're gonna beat them.

38:37.273 --> 38:40.608
Again, it's a marriage

38:40.651 --> 38:42.569
of science
and technology.

38:57.793 --> 39:00.545
I want dollar meal--

39:00.588 --> 39:04.174
- five rodeo cheeseburgers...
- Five rodeos. Okay.

39:04.216 --> 39:06.426
...two chicken sandwich.

39:06.469 --> 39:08.345
- Anything else?
- Two small drinks,

39:08.387 --> 39:10.597
and give me
a large Dr. Pepper.

39:10.639 --> 39:12.724
- $11.48.
- Thank you.

39:12.767 --> 39:14.768
First window.
Thank you.

39:19.231 --> 39:21.441
We didn't
even think about healthy eating

39:21.484 --> 39:23.526
because we used to think
everything was healthy.

39:23.569 --> 39:25.737
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.989
- Have a nice day.
- You too. Thank you very much.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.368
Now that I know that the food is

39:31.410 --> 39:33.370
really unhealthy for us,

39:33.412 --> 39:36.539
I feel guilty
giving it to my kids.

39:36.582 --> 39:40.251
But we don't have time to cook
because we leave at 6:00.

39:40.294 --> 39:43.671
We don't get home
until 9:00, 10:00 at night.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.758
When you have only
a dollar to spend

39:46.801 --> 39:48.760
and you have
two kids to feed,

39:48.803 --> 39:51.012
either you go
to the market

39:51.055 --> 39:52.889
and try to find
something that's cheap

39:52.932 --> 39:54.933
or just go straight
through a drive-thru

39:54.975 --> 39:57.268
and get two small
hamburgers for them

39:57.311 --> 39:59.229
and "Okay, here.
Eat them."

39:59.271 --> 40:01.189
This is what's
gonna fill her up,

40:01.232 --> 40:04.067
not that one single item
at the market.

40:10.032 --> 40:11.699
Look at the broccoli.

40:11.742 --> 40:13.660
It's too expensive, man.

40:16.497 --> 40:19.958
- What do you want to eat then?
- Mama.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.253
First check to see how many are there
for a pound.

40:28.384 --> 40:30.301
- Uh, we're not getting it.
- Why not?

40:30.344 --> 40:32.011
You'd only get
two or three.

40:32.054 --> 40:35.056
- No. Come on.
- Aww!

40:40.354 --> 40:43.231
We can find candy
that's cheaper.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.191
We can find chips
that are cheaper.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.110
The sodas are
really cheap.

40:47.153 --> 40:49.237
Sometimes you look
at a vegetable and say

40:49.280 --> 40:51.781
"Okay, we can get
two hamburgers over here

40:51.824 --> 40:53.324
for the same amount
of price."

40:54.910 --> 40:56.494
Why is it that you can buy

40:56.537 --> 40:58.955
a double-cheeseburger
at McDonald's for 99¢,

40:58.998 --> 41:01.916
and you can't even get
a head of broccoli for 99¢?

41:01.959 --> 41:04.794
- You want the small one?
- We've skewed our food system

41:04.837 --> 41:06.880
to the bad calories

41:06.922 --> 41:09.674
and it's not
an accident.

41:09.717 --> 41:13.303
I mean, the reasons that those calories
are cheaper is

41:13.345 --> 41:15.972
because those are the ones
we're heavily subsidizing.

41:18.684 --> 41:21.019
And this is directly tied
to the kind of agriculture

41:21.061 --> 41:22.520
that we're practicing

41:22.563 --> 41:24.647
and the kind
of farm policies we have.

41:24.690 --> 41:26.941
All those
snack-food calories are

41:26.984 --> 41:29.611
the ones that come
from the commodity crops--

41:29.653 --> 41:31.446
from the wheat,
from the corn

41:31.489 --> 41:33.156
and from the soybeans.

41:33.199 --> 41:35.575
By making those calories
really cheap,

41:35.618 --> 41:38.453
that's one of the reasons
that the biggest predictor

41:38.496 --> 41:40.121
of obesity is
income level.

41:40.164 --> 41:42.457
Over the course
of human history,

41:42.500 --> 41:44.292
we were struggling
to make sure we had

41:44.335 --> 41:46.461
enough food
and enough calories

41:46.504 --> 41:48.838
for a sizable percentage
of the human race.

41:48.881 --> 41:50.882
Now the problem is
too many calories.

41:50.925 --> 41:53.510
The industry
blames obesity

41:53.552 --> 41:55.637
on a crisis of personal
responsibility.

41:55.679 --> 41:58.264
But when you're
engineering foods

41:58.307 --> 42:00.975
you are pressing
our evolutionary buttons.

42:01.018 --> 42:03.686
The fact is
we're hardwired

42:03.729 --> 42:06.064
to go for three tastes--

42:06.106 --> 42:08.816
salt, fat and sugar.

42:08.859 --> 42:10.652
These things are
very rare in nature

42:10.694 --> 42:13.571
Now sugar is
available 24/7

42:13.614 --> 42:15.323
in tremendous quantities.

42:15.366 --> 42:18.493
We're eating hundreds of pounds
of the stuff a year.

42:18.536 --> 42:20.662
This diet
of high-fructose corn syrup

42:20.704 --> 42:22.455
and refined carbohydrates

42:22.498 --> 42:24.499
leads to these spikes
of insulin

42:24.542 --> 42:27.627
and, gradually, a wearing down
of the system

42:27.670 --> 42:29.963
by which our body
metabolizes sugar.

42:34.510 --> 42:37.470
My husband's diabetic.

42:37.513 --> 42:39.597
One of my main concerns is

42:39.640 --> 42:41.849
he could lose his sight.

42:41.892 --> 42:46.271
He does get into--
sometimes he's shaking,

42:46.313 --> 42:49.649
so I'm afraid that he's gonna start
not being able to drive,

42:49.692 --> 42:51.818
'cause that's what
he does for a profession.

42:51.860 --> 42:54.737
We have to consider
his medicine.

42:54.780 --> 42:56.739
What is it, $70?

42:56.782 --> 42:59.701
50 pills costs me
about $130.

42:59.743 --> 43:01.452
But he's on two
different types of pills.

43:01.495 --> 43:03.162
$100-and-something
for one pill

43:03.205 --> 43:05.123
and then $100-
and-something for another.

43:05.165 --> 43:07.166
That takes a lot
of our income away.

43:07.209 --> 43:10.420
We're really tight
from either

43:10.462 --> 43:12.547
paying for his medicine
to be healthy

43:12.590 --> 43:16.217
or buying vegetables
to be healthy.

43:16.260 --> 43:18.344
So which one
should we do?

43:20.723 --> 43:23.641
It's hard to see my dad
suffer with diabetes

43:23.684 --> 43:25.143
and stuff like that.

43:25.185 --> 43:28.271
And it's really sad to see
that my sister might have it.

43:28.314 --> 43:30.356
There's something
that's going on

43:30.399 --> 43:32.483
in the way
that we live our lives,

43:32.526 --> 43:34.569
where we play,
where we buy our food

43:34.612 --> 43:36.487
and the types of food
that we're able to buy

43:36.530 --> 43:38.990
that is causing
this epidemic.

43:39.033 --> 43:40.700
It's not just
our community.

43:40.743 --> 43:42.577
It's not just Baldwin Park.
It's everywhere.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.829
How many of us
know one person

43:44.872 --> 43:46.873
in our family
with diabetes?

43:48.876 --> 43:51.002
How about two?

43:51.045 --> 43:53.671
Three?
Keep your hand--

43:53.714 --> 43:56.215
It used to be that
type 2 diabetes

43:56.258 --> 43:58.092
only affected adults.

43:58.135 --> 44:01.721
And now it's affecting children
at epidemic proportions.

44:57.820 --> 44:59.320
Everything we've done

44:59.363 --> 45:01.114
in modern industrial
agriculture

45:01.156 --> 45:04.784
is to grow it faster,
fatter, bigger, cheaper.

45:06.203 --> 45:08.621
Nobody's thinking
about E. coli,

45:08.664 --> 45:11.916
type 2 diabetes
and the ecological health

45:11.959 --> 45:14.085
of the whole system.

45:14.128 --> 45:16.504
We're outsourcing

45:16.547 --> 45:20.383
autonomous farmer
decision making--

45:20.426 --> 45:22.510
we're outsourcing that
to corporate boardrooms

45:22.553 --> 45:25.805
in big cities
1,000 miles away

45:25.848 --> 45:27.849
where people make decisions
and don't live

45:27.891 --> 45:30.268
with the consequences
of those decisions.

45:49.246 --> 45:51.289
Everything is
grass based.

45:51.331 --> 45:55.209
You know, they don't eat
corn, dead cows

45:55.252 --> 45:58.379
or chicken manure like they feed
right here in the valley--

45:58.422 --> 45:59.964
or dead chickens.

46:00.007 --> 46:04.135
They actually eat
grass, forage--

46:04.178 --> 46:06.262
you know, clover,
grass, herbs.

46:06.305 --> 46:07.847
They're herbivores.

46:09.141 --> 46:11.267
If they were eating corn,

46:11.310 --> 46:14.270
you're gonna have to harvest that corn,
transport that corn,

46:14.313 --> 46:17.982
then you're gonna have to haul
all that manure somewhere

46:18.025 --> 46:20.568
that comes out
the back end.

46:20.611 --> 46:23.529
Here... it's--

46:23.572 --> 46:26.949
there-- there is
the whole thing.

46:26.992 --> 46:29.702
I mean the cow is--
she's fertilizing.

46:29.745 --> 46:31.788
She's mowing. We don't have to
spread any manure.

46:31.830 --> 46:34.040
We don't have to harvest it--
she's harvesting it.

46:34.082 --> 46:37.585
It's all real time--
real solar dollars.

46:39.546 --> 46:41.422
The industrial food system

46:41.465 --> 46:44.842
gradually became
so noisy, smelly,

46:44.885 --> 46:47.178
not a person-friendly place,

46:47.221 --> 46:49.639
that the people
who operate those plants

46:49.681 --> 46:51.307
don't want anybody
to go there,

46:51.350 --> 46:53.684
because then people would
see the ugly truth.

46:55.187 --> 46:56.854
When that occurred,

46:56.897 --> 46:59.315
then we lost
all the integrity

46:59.358 --> 47:02.568
and all the accountability
in the food system.

47:04.279 --> 47:06.030
If we put glass walls

47:06.073 --> 47:09.200
on all the megaprocessing
facilities,

47:09.243 --> 47:12.328
we would have a different food system
in this country.

47:42.401 --> 47:44.318
We have allowed ourselves

47:44.361 --> 47:47.321
to become so disconnected
and ignorant

47:47.364 --> 47:51.742
about something that is as intimate...

47:51.785 --> 47:53.953
...as the food that we eat.

47:55.789 --> 47:57.999
What a difference
this is to be out here

47:58.041 --> 47:59.876
in the fresh air,
sunshine,

47:59.918 --> 48:01.752
birds singing
in the trees, you know?

48:01.795 --> 48:04.714
But you see,
according to the U.S.D.A,

48:04.756 --> 48:06.173
this is unsanitary

48:06.216 --> 48:08.134
because it's open
to the air.

48:08.176 --> 48:09.594
They tried
to close us down.

48:09.636 --> 48:12.013
One of the biggest
showdowns we had was

48:12.055 --> 48:13.723
when they tried
to close us down

48:13.765 --> 48:16.058
because this was
unsanitary.

48:16.101 --> 48:17.894
Can you imagine?

48:17.936 --> 48:21.480
So we had them cultured
at a local microbiology lab.

48:23.650 --> 48:28.446
Ours averaged
133 C.F.U.

48:28.488 --> 48:30.823
and the ones
from the store

48:30.866 --> 48:33.117
averaged 3600.

48:33.160 --> 48:36.871
Of course, those have been through
40 trillion baths.

48:36.914 --> 48:39.498
Ours haven't seen
any chlorine.

48:40.876 --> 48:43.461
A lot of people wonder
"Is this real?

48:43.503 --> 48:45.630
I mean, can you really
feed the world?"

48:45.672 --> 48:49.091
That whole thing is
such a specious argument

48:49.134 --> 48:53.220
because, yes,

48:53.263 --> 48:54.639
we're every bit
as efficient,

48:54.681 --> 48:57.099
especially
if you plug in

48:57.142 --> 49:00.019
all of the inefficiencies
of the industrial system.

49:01.480 --> 49:03.898
I've had people come up
at farmer's markets

49:03.941 --> 49:08.277
and say "What?
$3 a dozen for eggs?"

49:08.320 --> 49:11.864
And they're drinking
a 75¢ can of soda.

49:16.036 --> 49:19.372
Hey, pig.
Hey, piggles.

49:21.708 --> 49:23.417
Hey, pigs.

49:25.087 --> 49:29.674
I'm always struck by how successful
we have been

49:29.716 --> 49:32.593
at hitting the bull's-eye
of the wrong target.

49:34.596 --> 49:36.847
I mean we have learned--
for example,

49:36.890 --> 49:40.226
in cattle we have
learned how to--

49:40.268 --> 49:43.646
how to plant,

49:43.689 --> 49:45.773
fertilize
and harvest corn

49:45.816 --> 49:48.651
using global positioning
satellite technology,

49:48.694 --> 49:52.029
and nobody sits back
and asks

49:52.072 --> 49:54.865
"But should we be
feeding cows corn?"

49:54.908 --> 49:58.869
We've become
a culture of technicians.

49:58.912 --> 50:00.913
We're all into--

50:00.956 --> 50:03.541
we're all
into the how of it

50:03.583 --> 50:05.835
and nobody's
stepping back

50:05.877 --> 50:07.753
and saying "But why?"

50:10.382 --> 50:12.550
I mean, a culture
that just views a pig

50:12.592 --> 50:15.219
as a pile of protoplasmic
inanimate structure

50:15.262 --> 50:17.888
to be manipulated
by whatever creative design

50:17.931 --> 50:20.850
that humans can foist
on that critter

50:20.892 --> 50:23.102
will probably view

50:23.145 --> 50:25.187
individuals
within its community

50:25.230 --> 50:28.357
and other cultures in the community
of nations

50:28.400 --> 50:30.609
with the same type
of disdain,

50:30.652 --> 50:32.486
disrespect

50:32.529 --> 50:34.905
and controlling-type
mentality.

51:00.849 --> 51:02.975
The town where the plant is located

51:03.018 --> 51:05.227
is a small town
called Tar Heel

51:05.270 --> 51:08.606
in the middle of a very
economically-depressed area.

51:12.235 --> 51:14.153
Smithfield has mastered

51:14.196 --> 51:16.614
the art of picking
and choosing

51:16.656 --> 51:19.116
a workforce
that they can exploit,

51:19.159 --> 51:22.286
initially from
the local workforce--

51:22.329 --> 51:25.873
the poor whites,
the poor black.

51:25.916 --> 51:28.876
They went through
that workforce very quickly.

51:30.253 --> 51:32.838
Now they have to
bus their workers

51:32.881 --> 51:36.008
all the way from Dentsville,
South Carolina,

51:36.051 --> 51:37.968
to Clinton,
North Carolina.

51:38.011 --> 51:42.306
You have to draw a circle 100 miles
in diameter,

51:42.349 --> 51:45.643
and that's where all of your workers
are coming from.

51:53.485 --> 51:55.820
They have the same
mentality towards workers

51:55.862 --> 51:57.321
as they do towards the hogs.

52:00.492 --> 52:04.787
You know, the hog, they don't
really have to worry about their comfort

52:04.830 --> 52:06.914
because they're temporary.
They're gonna be killed.

52:08.542 --> 52:11.460
And they have the same viewpoint
to the worker.

52:11.503 --> 52:13.629
You're not worried about the longevity
of the worker

52:13.672 --> 52:16.465
because, to them,
everything has an end.

52:37.612 --> 52:40.406
When you've got 2000 hogs
an hour going through

52:40.448 --> 52:43.951
employees, because they're handling
these guts so much,

52:43.994 --> 52:46.412
they get infections in
their fingernails and all.

52:46.454 --> 52:48.247
All their fingernails
separate from their fingers.

52:48.290 --> 52:52.543
You're covered
with blood, feces, urine.

52:52.586 --> 52:54.378
It's easy
to get hurt down there.

52:54.421 --> 52:56.338
You're doing
that same movement

52:56.381 --> 52:58.007
for that same piece
of the hog

52:58.049 --> 53:00.176
and it's nonstop,
you know.

53:00.218 --> 53:03.220
Basically you're treated
as a human machine.

53:03.263 --> 53:05.806
You get people that can't afford

53:05.849 --> 53:07.892
to leave from out there,
and Smithfield knows this.

53:07.934 --> 53:10.519
And that's what
they hold over you.

53:17.027 --> 53:18.736
100 years ago

53:18.778 --> 53:20.863
when Upton Sinclair wrote
"The Jungle"

53:20.906 --> 53:23.616
there was a beef trust
that wielded enormous power.

53:25.368 --> 53:28.579
Immigrants from Eastern Europe
were being abused

53:28.622 --> 53:31.832
in the absence of any kind of
government regulation

53:31.875 --> 53:35.169
There were horrible
disfiguring injuries

53:35.212 --> 53:36.837
and even deaths.

53:39.633 --> 53:43.177
Things got better.
They slowly got better.

53:44.638 --> 53:47.097
Teddy Roosevelt took on the beef trust.

53:47.140 --> 53:51.769
Labor unions slowly organized
meatpacking workers

53:51.811 --> 53:54.939
and turned it into one of the best
industrial jobs

53:54.981 --> 53:56.649
in the United States.

53:57.859 --> 54:01.111
By the 1950s
to be a meatpacking worker

54:01.154 --> 54:03.364
was like being
an auto worker

54:03.406 --> 54:07.493
who has a good wage,
good benefits, pension.

54:07.535 --> 54:10.079
And then what happened?

54:10.121 --> 54:12.373
Well, the meat-packing
companies got bigger

54:12.415 --> 54:15.292
in order to serve the needs
of the fast-food industry,

54:15.335 --> 54:17.461
which was
its biggest customer.

54:17.504 --> 54:20.130
Some of the meat-packing
companies like IBP

54:20.173 --> 54:22.716
borrowed the same sort
of labor practices

54:22.759 --> 54:24.301
from the fast food
industry--

54:24.344 --> 54:27.471
cutting wages, making sure there
were no unions,

54:27.514 --> 54:29.139
speeding up production,

54:29.182 --> 54:31.433
and having the worker
do the same task

54:31.476 --> 54:33.644
again and again
and again.

54:33.687 --> 54:35.938
And meat-packing is now

54:35.981 --> 54:38.899
one of the most dangerous jobs
in the United States.

54:41.319 --> 54:43.320
The meat-packing industry
also recruited

54:43.363 --> 54:45.864
a new set of immigrants--
illegal immigrants

54:45.907 --> 54:48.325
and recent immigrants
from Mexico.

54:50.412 --> 54:53.330
Many of the illegal immigrants
coming to America

54:53.373 --> 54:56.000
were corn farmers
in Mexico.

54:56.042 --> 54:59.670
NAFTA led to a flooding
of the Mexican market

54:59.713 --> 55:02.131
with cheap American corn.

55:02.173 --> 55:06.677
It's put more than a million and a half
Mexican farmers out of work.

55:06.720 --> 55:09.388
They couldn't compete with this
cheap corn coming from America.

55:11.391 --> 55:14.768
So what happens to those million
and a half Mexican farmers?

55:15.770 --> 55:17.896
Meat packers like IBP,

55:17.939 --> 55:19.690
National Beef
and Monfort

55:19.733 --> 55:22.526
began actively recruiting
in Mexico.

55:23.778 --> 55:26.113
Companies advertised
on the radio

55:26.156 --> 55:27.573
and in newspapers.

55:27.615 --> 55:30.868
IBP set up
a bus service

55:30.910 --> 55:34.038
in Mexico to bring workers
into the United States.

55:36.291 --> 55:38.917
For years the government
turned a blind eye

55:38.960 --> 55:40.419
to the recruitment
of immigrants

55:40.462 --> 55:42.254
by the meat-packing industry.

55:42.297 --> 55:44.882
But now, when there's
an anti-immigrant movement,

55:44.924 --> 55:46.508
they're cracking down
all of a sudden,

55:46.551 --> 55:48.761
but they're not cracking down
on these companies.

55:48.803 --> 55:51.513
The government's cracking down
on the workers.

56:11.159 --> 56:14.119
Immigration agents are
arresting Smithfield workers

56:14.162 --> 56:17.122
at this trailer park.

56:17.165 --> 56:18.957
This is an agreement

56:19.000 --> 56:21.251
between Smithfield
and Immigrations authorities.

56:21.294 --> 56:23.921
They get rid
of 15 workers per day,

56:23.963 --> 56:26.256
but you don't see
any massive raids.

56:26.299 --> 56:28.759
That way it doesn't affect
the production line.

56:41.356 --> 56:44.650
- Sir, we are trying--
- She asked me a question.

56:44.692 --> 56:46.527
She is asking us
questions, not you.

56:48.822 --> 56:51.865
I don't see anybody arresting
no Smithfield managers.

56:51.908 --> 56:54.159
Nobody in the plant
that had anything to do

56:54.202 --> 56:55.828
with the fact that
those workers were hired

56:55.870 --> 56:57.287
is being arrested.

56:57.330 --> 56:59.790
What we see today
is workers

56:59.833 --> 57:01.834
who were producing for
this company and working hard--

57:01.876 --> 57:03.877
those are the people
who get arrested.

57:20.103 --> 57:22.563
We want to pay
the cheapest price for our food.

57:22.605 --> 57:25.190
We don't understand that
that comes at a price.

57:26.693 --> 57:30.320
These workers, they've been
here for 10, 15 years

57:30.363 --> 57:34.616
processing your bacon,
your holiday ham

57:34.659 --> 57:37.703
and now they're getting picked up
like they're criminals.

57:39.164 --> 57:42.249
And these companies are
making billions of dollars.

58:11.112 --> 58:13.614
Is cheapness everything that there is?

58:13.656 --> 58:16.241
Who wants to buy
the cheapest car?

58:16.284 --> 58:18.744
We're willing
to subsidize

58:18.786 --> 58:21.580
the food system
to create the "mystique"

58:21.623 --> 58:23.540
of cheap food,

58:23.583 --> 58:26.752
when actually
it's very expensive food

58:26.794 --> 58:29.671
when you add up
the environmental costs

58:29.714 --> 58:32.758
societal costs,
health costs.

58:34.469 --> 58:37.429
The industrial food
is not honest food.

58:37.472 --> 58:40.140
It's not priced honestly.
It's not produced honestly.

58:40.183 --> 58:41.767
It's not processed honestly.

58:41.809 --> 58:44.811
There's nothing honest
about that food.

58:46.773 --> 58:50.234
I can't think of a better use
for a Smithfield box.

58:52.320 --> 58:54.821
It was about a five-hour drive

58:54.864 --> 58:56.949
maybe 300, 400 miles.

58:56.991 --> 58:59.034
So yeah.

58:59.077 --> 59:00.827
It's worth it.

59:03.540 --> 59:06.833
I have no desire
to scale up or get bigger.

59:08.169 --> 59:11.004
My desire is to produce
the best food in the world

59:11.047 --> 59:13.048
and heal.

59:13.091 --> 59:15.509
And if in doing so

59:15.552 --> 59:20.138
more people come to our corner
and want stuff,

59:20.181 --> 59:23.475
then heaven help me figure out
how to meet the need

59:23.518 --> 59:25.310
without compromising
the integrity.

59:25.353 --> 59:26.853
That-- that's where I am.

59:26.896 --> 59:30.732
I have
absolutely no desire

59:30.775 --> 59:33.068
to be at Wal-Mart.

59:33.111 --> 59:37.698
As soon as you grasp
for that growth,

59:37.740 --> 59:40.367
you're gonna view
your customer differently,

59:40.410 --> 59:42.160
you're gonna view
your product differently,

59:42.203 --> 59:44.246
you're gonna view
your business differently.

59:44.289 --> 59:48.250
You're gonna view everything that is
the most important--

59:48.293 --> 59:50.085
you're gonna view
that differently.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:08.061
This is our new
organic line of popcorn.

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:09.980
This is Vitasoy soy milk,

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:11.732
the best soy milk
in the entire world.

01:00:12.859 --> 01:00:15.444
This entire show
when it first started

01:00:15.486 --> 01:00:17.446
was the size
of this column right here.

01:00:17.488 --> 01:00:18.780
Uh-huh.

01:00:18.823 --> 01:00:20.907
Several of us were sleeping
in our booths.

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:22.576
We couldn't afford
hotel rooms.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.580
Organic's been growing
over 20% annually.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:30.542
It's one of the fastest-growing segments
in the food industry.

01:00:30.585 --> 01:00:32.044
My God! Ah!

01:00:32.086 --> 01:00:33.629
We're not gonna
get rid of capitalism.

01:00:33.671 --> 01:00:35.547
Certainly we're not
gonna get rid of it

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:38.634
in the time that we need
to arrest global warming

01:00:38.676 --> 01:00:40.886
and reverse
the toxification

01:00:40.928 --> 01:00:42.929
of our air,
our food and our water.

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:44.848
We need to be
much more urgent.

01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:48.393
If we attempt to make perfect
the enemy of the good

01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:50.145
and say we're only
going to buy food

01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:52.731
from the most-perfect system

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:55.609
within 100 miles of us,
we're never gonna get there.

01:01:00.448 --> 01:01:02.699
As an environmentalist,
it was pretty clear to me

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:04.868
that business was the source of all
the pollution,

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:07.496
business was the source of basically
all the things

01:01:07.538 --> 01:01:09.706
that were
destroying this world.

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:16.254
In college I came across
this little institute

01:01:16.297 --> 01:01:17.798
called New Alchemy
Institute,

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:20.926
which was a group
of renegade biologists.

01:01:20.968 --> 01:01:22.928
My hope is
to give you--

01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:26.932
We were preaching a kind
of a new religion,

01:01:26.974 --> 01:01:30.602
trying to develop food
and waste-treatment alternatives,

01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:32.688
but we were preaching
to the convinced.

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:37.025
We were depending on sources of support
that were dried up

01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:39.111
and we weren't
reaching the audience

01:01:39.153 --> 01:01:41.405
that really needed
these messages.

01:01:41.447 --> 01:01:45.659
I realized we need
to not be David

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:48.495
up against Goliath.
We need to be Goliath.

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:03.260
When we started out,
we were a seven-cow farm.

01:02:03.302 --> 01:02:07.973
We wanted to prove that business
could be part of the solution

01:02:08.015 --> 01:02:09.933
to the globe's
environmental problems.

01:02:09.976 --> 01:02:11.893
At the same time
we had to prove

01:02:11.936 --> 01:02:13.812
that we could be
highly profitable.

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:19.067
Today in 2008,
not only are

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.778
we the #3 yogurt brand
in America,

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:23.822
but we're among
the most profitable.

01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:36.585
See, this is
the interesting thing.

01:02:36.627 --> 01:02:38.545
A little company
like this is now Kraft,

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.589
but you don't have
any idea that it's Kraft.

01:02:40.631 --> 01:02:43.675
This is now Pepsi.
That's now Kellogg's.

01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:46.094
- Kashi is Kellogg's?
- Yeah.

01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:49.097
- This is Colgate now.
- Oh, is it?

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:52.476
Yeah, this is one of those companies
that started like us.

01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:57.272
- Well, it's--
- Make them different?

01:02:57.315 --> 01:02:59.274
Make them successful,
basically.

01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:03.487
The jury is out.
I have to put it that way.

01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:07.365
These large companies
don't grow organically.

01:03:07.408 --> 01:03:09.701
They grow by acquisition.

01:03:09.744 --> 01:03:12.329
Coke, Pepsi, Kellogg's,
General Mills--

01:03:12.371 --> 01:03:13.997
all of them are running,

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.082
not walking, into the organic
food business.

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:27.302
For me, when a Wal-Mart
enters the organic space,

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:29.888
I'm thrilled. It's absolutely one of
the most exciting things.

01:03:29.931 --> 01:03:32.015
I have dreamed
of the day

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:34.017
when I could sit
with corporate titans

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.186
and have conversations

01:03:36.229 --> 01:03:38.188
about organics
and sustainability.

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:40.899
- This is Amanda. This is Rand.
- Hi Amanda. I'm Rand.

01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:43.109
- Rand, nice to meet you.
- Tony.

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:44.694
- Tony. Great.
- Nice to meet you.

01:03:44.737 --> 01:03:46.988
Okay, help me
figure out where--

01:03:47.031 --> 01:03:49.407
- We both work for Wal-Mart.
- You're with Wal-Mart.

01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:50.575
Yup.

01:03:50.618 --> 01:03:52.118
Do you know that we don't go
to Wal-Mart?

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:53.995
- We've never been.
- Oh yeah.

01:03:54.038 --> 01:03:56.873
- Isn't that amazing?
- So we had to come to you.

01:03:56.916 --> 01:03:58.792
Yeah, we've never been.

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:00.502
We just started boycotting
a long time ago

01:04:00.545 --> 01:04:03.171
and we just kept
riding on that.

01:04:03.214 --> 01:04:05.882
Wal-Mart is terribly sensitive

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:07.384
to their reputation.

01:04:07.426 --> 01:04:09.886
They've obviously
been vilified,

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:12.013
probably more
than any retailer

01:04:12.056 --> 01:04:14.015
in our current economy.

01:04:14.058 --> 01:04:16.393
Actually, it's a pretty
easy decision

01:04:16.435 --> 01:04:19.938
to try to support things like organic,
or whatever it might be,

01:04:19.981 --> 01:04:22.357
based on what
the customer wants.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.401
We see that
and react to it.

01:04:24.443 --> 01:04:27.112
So if it's clear
the customer wants it,

01:04:27.154 --> 01:04:29.573
it's really easy
to get behind it,

01:04:29.615 --> 01:04:31.324
to push forward and try to make
that happen.

01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:35.537
When I run into
my old environmental friends,

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:38.248
many are
initially horrified

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:42.168
by the kinds of company
that I'm keeping these days.

01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:44.921
But when I then
go on to explain

01:04:44.964 --> 01:04:47.924
what the impact of one purchase order
from Wal-Mart is,

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:51.094
in terms of not pounds
but tons of pesticide,

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:53.847
tons of herbicide,
tons of chemical fertilizer,

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:57.058
the discussion--
we get away from the emotion

01:04:57.101 --> 01:04:59.102
and we get down
to the facts.

01:04:59.145 --> 01:05:02.314
This is really key, though,
what you guys are doing here.

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:08.278
I have no illusions
about this.

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:10.113
I don't believe that
Wal-Mart has come here

01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:13.158
because they've suddenly had
a moral enlightenment.

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.785
It's because
of economics.

01:05:15.828 --> 01:05:18.747
I can debate with my radical friends
all day long,

01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:20.999
but nobody can
challenge the fact

01:05:21.042 --> 01:05:23.793
that a sale of another
million dollars to Wal-Mart

01:05:23.836 --> 01:05:25.587
helps to save
the world.

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:36.598
Back around the turn
of the last century,

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:39.184
the average farmer could
feed six or eight people.

01:05:41.354 --> 01:05:43.813
Now the average
American farmer

01:05:43.856 --> 01:05:46.983
can feed
126 people, okay?

01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:49.986
These are the most productive humans
that have ever lived.

01:05:51.864 --> 01:05:54.074
The changes down
on the farm have been

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:56.451
momentous and radical but invisible
to most of us,

01:05:56.494 --> 01:05:58.119
'cause who knows
a farmer anymore?

01:05:59.163 --> 01:06:00.872
But their way of life

01:06:00.915 --> 01:06:03.833
has been revolutionized.

01:06:26.732 --> 01:06:28.525
10,000 years ago,

01:06:28.567 --> 01:06:30.235
farmers started saving
their best seeds

01:06:30.277 --> 01:06:32.404
and planted again
in the following year.

01:06:32.446 --> 01:06:34.656
That's how seeds
have been developed.

01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:36.282
That's how corn
was developed

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:38.702
from a useless grass
for the most part

01:06:38.744 --> 01:06:41.371
to the extremely
productive plant it is today.

01:06:42.873 --> 01:06:45.291
The idea that any corporation
could own a food crop

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:48.461
is a very new idea.
It wasn't until the 1980s

01:06:48.504 --> 01:06:51.214
that the Supreme Court said
you could patent life.

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:52.632
And that opened
the floodgates--

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:55.385
efforts to patent the most valuable
parts of life,

01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:57.929
which is to say the crops
on which we depend.

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:01.558
Monsanto is a chemical company.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:05.645
They produced DDT,
Agent Orange in Vietnam,

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:08.023
and then they developed
a product called "Roundup."

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:14.154
We started hearing rumblings
about genetically-engineered soybeans

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:16.906
that could resist
the application of Roundup.

01:07:16.949 --> 01:07:18.950
When the Roundup was
sprayed over top of it,

01:07:18.993 --> 01:07:20.368
it killed
every weed out there

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:22.662
except for this
Roundup Ready soybean.

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:41.973
I can remember
when the first prohibition

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:44.184
against seed saving
came into being.

01:07:44.226 --> 01:07:46.394
Most farmers were just

01:07:46.437 --> 01:07:50.023
absolutely disgusted
with the whole concept.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:52.358
It's been interesting
over the course

01:07:52.401 --> 01:07:54.861
of 11 years
to watch us go

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:56.863
from utter contempt
for the notion

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:58.907
that we can't save
our own seed

01:07:58.949 --> 01:08:00.742
to acceptance.

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:03.119
What happens if a farmer

01:08:03.162 --> 01:08:05.371
saves the seeds?

01:08:08.042 --> 01:08:10.376
Well, you know,
really there's

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:12.378
only one company involved
in this now

01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:14.255
and that's Monsanto.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.301
Monsanto is...

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:28.269
They've got a team
of private investigators

01:08:28.312 --> 01:08:30.145
that kind of roam
the country

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:32.232
and they've got
a little 1-800 hotline

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:35.693
they take calls on.
If they get a call

01:08:35.736 --> 01:08:38.154
and somebody alleges
that somebody saved seed,

01:08:38.197 --> 01:08:41.533
they'll send an investigator out
to look into the matter.

01:08:45.912 --> 01:08:47.872
If you save your own seed,
you're gonna get a call

01:08:47.915 --> 01:08:49.666
from somebody
from Monsanto.

01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:13.939
Two men drove in my driveway

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.567
at 7:00,
7:30 at night,

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:17.234
presented
a black card to me

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:20.404
and they never told me
that they were from Monsanto.

01:09:20.447 --> 01:09:23.825
They said that they had
had a surveillance team,

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.702
caught me
cleaning beans.

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:29.455
I found it necessary to get up

01:09:29.497 --> 01:09:31.124
at 3:00 and 4:00
in the morning

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:35.795
before the investigators are
on the road following me.

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:37.546
They were--

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:40.508
I'm gonna say maybe ex-military
or ex-police.

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:43.303
They were large
and they were intimidating.

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:46.555
I don't know whether they had
their surveillance team

01:09:46.599 --> 01:09:50.143
or whether it was my neighbor that
turned me in. I don't know.

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:52.145
Now as I turned to walk in the house,
one of them said--

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:54.439
I could hear in the back--
"He's guilty."

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:27.722
It's a real ingenious device
designed back in the 1800s,

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:31.392
and Monsanto's gonna
close all of them out.

01:10:39.193 --> 01:10:40.985
So how many seed cleaners
are out there

01:10:41.028 --> 01:10:42.445
in the country
do you think?

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:45.156
In the state of Indiana,
there may be six.

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:47.033
Maybe.
I'm not aware of--

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:50.536
- How many there used to be?
- Oh my golly. Every county had three.

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:52.372
Have they all been
put out of business?

01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:53.915
There's nobody left.

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:04.884
When Monsanto soybeans
first came on the market,

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.970
I just never
really switched over.

01:11:08.013 --> 01:11:09.764
I was getting
pretty good yield

01:11:09.807 --> 01:11:11.349
with the conventional
soybeans I'd been using,

01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:14.102
so I thought "Well,
I'll just stay where I'm at."

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:23.861
My neighbors
all around me are all GMOs.

01:11:23.904 --> 01:11:26.823
If the pollen goes in,
if the seed moves in,

01:11:26.865 --> 01:11:29.534
I am still held
accountable.

01:11:36.417 --> 01:11:40.044
When you genetically
modify a crop, you own it.

01:11:40.087 --> 01:11:42.630
We've never had this
in agriculture.

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:47.969
Used to be that your
land-grant universities,

01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:50.430
they developed what
was called public seed.

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:53.016
The vast majority
of the plant breeding

01:11:53.058 --> 01:11:55.143
was actually done
in these public institutions

01:11:55.185 --> 01:11:58.062
Monsanto is very much like Microsoft.

01:11:58.105 --> 01:12:00.732
The same way Microsoft owns
the intellectual property

01:12:00.774 --> 01:12:03.109
behind most computers
in America,

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:05.653
they set out to own
the intellectual property

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:08.072
behind most of the food
in America.

01:12:08.115 --> 01:12:11.075
Public plant breeding is
a thing of the past.

01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:14.162
There virtually are
no public seeds anymore.

01:12:17.124 --> 01:12:19.167
There's only like four or five varieties

01:12:19.209 --> 01:12:20.918
that I can actually plant.

01:12:20.961 --> 01:12:22.754
Now I have some
of the last soybeans

01:12:22.796 --> 01:12:24.630
coming out
of the state of Illinois--

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:27.633
- That are not GMO.
- Public variety. Public variety.

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:31.721
When it comes to the point that I can't
buy any more certified seed,

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:34.557
what do I do?
What are my options?

01:12:38.145 --> 01:12:40.688
I acquired this list
that was mailed to me.

01:12:40.731 --> 01:12:44.942
The black list here is Monsanto's
unauthorized growers list.

01:12:44.985 --> 01:12:46.152
Wow.

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:48.654
Either farmers that have
judgments against them,

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:51.032
or businesses,
or else it's--

01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:53.743
or it's farmers that have not submitted
their paperwork,

01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:55.703
will not turn over
their records.

01:12:55.746 --> 01:12:57.538
For my case,
that's why I'm on there--

01:12:57.581 --> 01:12:59.957
'cause I would not
turn over my records.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.794
- Am I on this list?
- Yes, you are.

01:13:02.836 --> 01:13:04.796
Wow.

01:13:04.838 --> 01:13:07.507
I see two of the farmers
that I work for on here.

01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:10.093
This list-- now it comes down
to the point

01:13:10.135 --> 01:13:12.804
where I cannot buy
Monsanto products, okay?

01:13:12.846 --> 01:13:14.180
Right.

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:16.682
So it's coming down to
"What can I plant?"

01:13:19.436 --> 01:13:22.063
Monsanto is suing me
on the basis

01:13:22.106 --> 01:13:25.441
that I'm encouraging the farmer
to break the patent law

01:13:25.484 --> 01:13:27.652
by cleaning
their own seed.

01:13:35.536 --> 01:13:37.662
I haven't been
in a courtroom yet

01:13:37.704 --> 01:13:40.748
and my bill is
already $25,000.

01:13:42.876 --> 01:13:44.752
People that were
friends of mine

01:13:44.795 --> 01:13:47.255
now are reticent
to even talk with me.

01:13:50.759 --> 01:13:53.177
We've been friends
for 50 years,

01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:55.513
and now we can hardly be
seen together.

01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:56.848
Right.

01:14:00.894 --> 01:14:03.312
I don't think
I'm really guilty,

01:14:03.355 --> 01:14:06.190
but it was cheaper
to pay the fine

01:14:06.233 --> 01:14:08.526
than it was
to try to fight it.

01:14:08.569 --> 01:14:10.486
- It gnaws at you...
- Sure.

01:14:10.529 --> 01:14:13.030
...because if you think
you're right at something,

01:14:13.073 --> 01:14:15.241
but yet you admit
you're wrong.

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:25.376
Monsanto falsely accused us
of violating their patent

01:14:25.419 --> 01:14:27.420
and breach of contract.

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:29.547
None of it was true.

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:32.884
You go into a market,
you find a dominant farmer

01:14:32.926 --> 01:14:36.137
and if you can ruin them, you scare
the rest of them to following the line.

01:14:37.598 --> 01:14:39.474
My family spent $400,000

01:14:39.516 --> 01:14:41.851
fighting the battle, pretrial.

01:14:41.894 --> 01:14:43.811
And we were told
it would take another million

01:14:43.854 --> 01:14:45.396
to take the thing to trial.

01:14:45.439 --> 01:14:48.900
We settled out of court.

01:14:48.942 --> 01:14:51.569
The way the system appeared
to work to me was

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:53.696
Lady Justice had
the scales

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:55.907
and you piled cash
on the scales

01:14:55.949 --> 01:14:58.826
and the one that piled
the most cash on the scales,

01:14:58.869 --> 01:15:01.370
hired the most experts
and was most willing

01:15:01.413 --> 01:15:04.373
to tell the biggest lies,
that was the winner.

01:15:04.416 --> 01:15:07.502
That seems to be how our justice system
functions now.

01:15:07.544 --> 01:15:09.086
It's terrible.
It's terrible.

01:15:09.129 --> 01:15:11.088
How can a farmer
defend himself against

01:15:11.131 --> 01:15:13.049
a multinational corporation
like Monsanto?

01:15:14.384 --> 01:15:17.011
I talked to a young man
just three days ago.

01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:19.055
They'd been
to his farm, you know?

01:15:19.097 --> 01:15:22.433
And this poor kid,
he's just starting out.

01:15:22.476 --> 01:15:24.852
His fiancée was there.
I talked to her

01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:26.938
and tried to give them
the best advice I could.

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:28.856
Unfortunately the best advice
I could give them was

01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:33.444
"Try to get out of this thing
with your skin intact.

01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:35.821
Don't fight 'em.
You've got to roll over

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:38.491
and give them what they want,
'cause you can't defend yourself."

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:42.620
In the case of Monsanto,
their control is so dominant.

01:15:42.663 --> 01:15:45.957
If you want to be
in production agriculture,

01:15:45.999 --> 01:15:47.959
you're gonna be
in bed with Monsanto.

01:15:49.294 --> 01:15:51.128
They own the soybean.

01:15:51.171 --> 01:15:54.298
They are going to
control that product

01:15:54.341 --> 01:15:56.634
from seed
to the supermarket.

01:15:56.677 --> 01:15:58.844
They are, in effect,
gaining control of food.

01:16:15.529 --> 01:16:18.030
There has been
this revolving door

01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:20.741
between Monsanto's
corporate offices

01:16:20.784 --> 01:16:22.743
and the various regulatory

01:16:22.786 --> 01:16:25.162
and judicial bodies that
have made the key decisions.

01:16:25.205 --> 01:16:29.458
Justice Clarence Thomas
was a Monsanto attorney.

01:16:29.501 --> 01:16:32.003
That wouldn't be
such a big deal

01:16:32.045 --> 01:16:33.671
if it weren't
for one court case

01:16:33.714 --> 01:16:36.424
that really decided
this whole seed-saving issue.

01:16:36.466 --> 01:16:39.510
Justice Clarence Thomas
wrote the majority opinion

01:16:39.553 --> 01:16:42.179
in a case that allowed
these companies

01:16:42.222 --> 01:16:45.224
to prevent farmers
from saving their own seed.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:48.019
Monsanto had very close ties

01:16:48.061 --> 01:16:49.854
to the Bush administration...

01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:54.191
and the Clinton administration.

01:16:55.402 --> 01:16:59.030
This goes to why we haven't had
much political debate

01:16:59.072 --> 01:17:01.866
over this radical change
to our food system.

01:17:07.247 --> 01:17:09.665
For the last 25 years,
our government

01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:12.543
has been dominated
by the industries

01:17:12.586 --> 01:17:14.712
that it was meant
to be regulating.

01:17:19.676 --> 01:17:21.927
The challenge is as soon
as you have people

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:24.764
with expertise in industry, they may
turn out to be very good regulators.

01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:31.103
It's really about what interests
they decide to represent.

01:17:38.445 --> 01:17:40.696
You're talking about power--

01:17:40.739 --> 01:17:43.074
centralized power

01:17:43.116 --> 01:17:44.784
and that power
is being used

01:17:44.826 --> 01:17:47.620
against the people who are
really producing the food

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:48.913
like the farmers.

01:17:48.955 --> 01:17:50.831
It's being used
against the workers

01:17:50.874 --> 01:17:52.416
who work
for these companies

01:17:52.459 --> 01:17:55.002
and it's being used
against consumers

01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:57.672
who are deliberately
being kept in the dark

01:17:57.714 --> 01:18:00.591
about what they're eating,
where it comes from

01:18:00.634 --> 01:18:02.259
and what it's doing
to their bodies.

01:18:04.721 --> 01:18:08.849
Good afternoon,
Madame Chair and members.

01:18:08.892 --> 01:18:12.937
SB-63 is a consumer
right-to-know measure.

01:18:12.979 --> 01:18:16.440
It simply requires that
all foods that are cloned

01:18:16.483 --> 01:18:18.734
must be labeled
as cloned foods.

01:18:18.777 --> 01:18:21.028
These cloned animals are

01:18:21.071 --> 01:18:23.823
a fundamentally
new thing.

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:26.450
But I find it incredible
that the FDA

01:18:26.493 --> 01:18:30.329
not only wants to allow the sale of meat
from cloned animals

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:32.123
without further research,

01:18:32.165 --> 01:18:34.917
but also wants to allow
the sale of this meat

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.836
without any labeling.

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:39.004
How many witnesses
in opposition, please?

01:18:39.047 --> 01:18:41.549
Noelle Cremers
with California Farm Bureau.

01:18:41.591 --> 01:18:43.008
And if I can point out--

01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:45.761
the reason that we are
concerned with labeling

01:18:45.804 --> 01:18:49.098
is it creates unnecessary fear
in a consumer's mind.

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:50.808
Until the industry
has an opportunity

01:18:50.851 --> 01:18:52.810
to educate why we want
to use this technology

01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:54.353
and the value
of the technology,

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:56.731
we don't feel that
consumers just having

01:18:56.773 --> 01:18:58.691
a warning label
will help them.

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.783
These companies fight
tooth and nail

01:19:07.826 --> 01:19:09.577
against labeling.

01:19:10.662 --> 01:19:12.621
The fast food industry
fought against

01:19:12.664 --> 01:19:14.498
giving you
the calorie information.

01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:16.500
They fought against
telling you

01:19:16.543 --> 01:19:18.169
if there's trans fat
in their food.

01:19:18.211 --> 01:19:20.921
The meat packing industry
for years prevented

01:19:20.964 --> 01:19:23.257
country-of-origin labeling.

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:27.344
They fought not to label
genetically modified foods,

01:19:27.387 --> 01:19:30.848
and now 78% of the processed food
in the supermarket

01:19:30.891 --> 01:19:34.560
has some genetically-
modified ingredient.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:37.188
I think it's one
of the most important battles

01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:39.231
for consumers to fight--

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:41.942
is the right to know what's
in their food and how it was grown.

01:19:43.069 --> 01:19:45.070
Not only
do they not want

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:47.490
you to know
what's in it,

01:19:47.532 --> 01:19:49.909
they have managed
to make it against the law

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:52.661
to criticize
their products.

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:57.249
Can you tell me how
you've changed how you eat?

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:59.251
Yeah, we--

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:02.004
you'll probably have to
talk to an attorney

01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:03.422
before you would
put this in there.

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:05.299
What? You can say this is--
we've stopped--

01:20:05.342 --> 01:20:07.009
I know, but--

01:20:07.052 --> 01:20:08.969
I could have the meat
and poultry industry

01:20:09.012 --> 01:20:10.679
coming after me
and I really--

01:20:10.722 --> 01:20:13.516
Seriously? For saying--
that it's so--

01:20:13.558 --> 01:20:15.559
It depends
on the context.

01:20:15.602 --> 01:20:17.436
You're not saying
"Someone else don't eat it."

01:20:17.479 --> 01:20:18.938
Yeah, I'm sorry,
Robbie,

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.232
but I get asked this
all the time.

01:20:21.274 --> 01:20:24.318
Initially,
my reaction was

01:20:24.361 --> 01:20:26.612
"I don't care.
Let them sue me.

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:28.781
Let them try
and sue the mother

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:31.367
of a dead child
and see."

01:20:31.409 --> 01:20:34.370
It's pretty amazing
that you can't say

01:20:34.412 --> 01:20:37.289
- how you and your family have changed--
- The veggie libel laws...

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:42.336
are different.

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:47.383
The food industry has
different protections

01:20:47.425 --> 01:20:49.802
than other industries do.

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:53.305
We have a lot of questions
about this mad cow disease.

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:56.392
If you recall the case
where Oprah was sued

01:20:56.434 --> 01:20:58.561
by the meat industry

01:20:58.603 --> 01:21:01.230
for something
she said on her show.

01:21:01.273 --> 01:21:03.440
It has just
stopped me cold

01:21:03.483 --> 01:21:05.359
from eating
another burger.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.376
- Good morning, Oprah.
- Good morning, y'all.

01:21:22.419 --> 01:21:24.628
Are you glad to see
it's finally winding down?

01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:28.132
Well, I think
I can say that, right?

01:21:28.174 --> 01:21:31.844
I can say that, yeah.
I can see the end in sight.

01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:35.306
In Colorado it's a felony

01:21:35.348 --> 01:21:37.808
if you're convicted
under a veggie libel law.

01:21:37.851 --> 01:21:39.310
So you could
go to prison

01:21:39.352 --> 01:21:41.186
for criticizing
the ground beef

01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:43.480
that's being produced
in the state of Colorado.

01:21:43.523 --> 01:21:46.775
There is an effort
in several farm states

01:21:46.818 --> 01:21:48.777
to make it illegal
to publish

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:52.448
a photo of any
industrial food operation,

01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:55.326
any feedlot operation.

01:21:55.368 --> 01:21:57.328
At the same time, they've also gotten

01:21:57.370 --> 01:22:01.707
bills passed that are
called cheeseburger bills

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.626
that make it very
very difficult

01:22:03.668 --> 01:22:05.586
for you to sue them.

01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:08.380
These companies have
legions of attorneys

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:11.884
and they may sue even though they know
they can't win

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:14.261
just to send a message.

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:29.193
We are on record
for the deposition of Maurice Parr

01:22:29.235 --> 01:22:31.028
in the matter
of Monsanto Company

01:22:31.071 --> 01:22:32.905
and Monsanto Technology
versus Maurice Parr.

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:37.284
Mr. Parr, we subpoenaed
your bank records

01:22:37.327 --> 01:22:38.953
in this case.
Do you know that?

01:22:44.376 --> 01:22:46.585
I'll tell you, what really
scared me the most today

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:51.256
was the fact that they have every check
that I have written

01:22:51.299 --> 01:22:54.093
from every bank account
that I've used

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:56.595
in the last 10 years.

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:58.639
Do you own any land,
Mr. Parr?

01:22:58.682 --> 01:23:00.808
- Yes.
- How many acres do you own?

01:23:00.850 --> 01:23:01.892
Three.

01:23:01.935 --> 01:23:04.103
How long have you had
this Dell computer?

01:23:04.145 --> 01:23:07.815
Which ones are soybean seed
cleaning customers?

01:23:07.857 --> 01:23:09.817
- Mr. Kaufman?
- Beans only.

01:23:09.859 --> 01:23:12.361
These people are not just customers,

01:23:12.404 --> 01:23:14.446
they're personal friends.

01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:18.075
It's extremely
heart-wrenching for me

01:23:18.118 --> 01:23:21.620
to know that this list is
in the possession of Monsanto.

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:23.497
Harold Sinn?

01:23:24.541 --> 01:23:26.542
Beans only.

01:23:26.584 --> 01:23:28.544
This is the first case

01:23:28.586 --> 01:23:31.505
in which
a seed company is suing

01:23:31.548 --> 01:23:33.507
the person who does
the cleaning of the seed.

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:36.677
So if Monsanto's claims
are upheld in this case,

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:38.387
that would not only put
Moe out of business,

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:41.598
but it would prohibit
every grower in the country

01:23:41.641 --> 01:23:44.977
from doing what
Moe does as a precedent in future cases.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.896
Have any of these customers specifically

01:23:47.939 --> 01:23:49.898
told you that
they are not going to use

01:23:49.941 --> 01:23:52.943
- your seed-cleaning services anymore?
- Ron Merrill.

01:23:52.986 --> 01:23:55.904
This essentially puts me
out of business.

01:23:55.947 --> 01:23:58.657
- Max Lowe.
- I'm finished.

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:01.744
Jerry Kaufman.
Bill Zeering.

01:24:01.786 --> 01:24:04.246
Robert Duvall.

01:24:21.556 --> 01:24:24.141
We've had a food system
that's been dedicated

01:24:24.184 --> 01:24:26.268
to the single virtue
of efficiency,

01:24:26.311 --> 01:24:29.813
so we grow a very small
number of crops,

01:24:29.856 --> 01:24:31.774
a very small number
of varieties,

01:24:31.816 --> 01:24:33.859
a very small
number of companies.

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:36.320
And even though
you achieve efficiencies,

01:24:36.362 --> 01:24:38.822
the system gets
more and more precarious.

01:24:38.865 --> 01:24:41.033
You will have
a breakdown eventually.

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:43.035
And where the breakdown
comes in the system

01:24:43.078 --> 01:24:44.787
we don't always know.

01:24:46.706 --> 01:24:49.583
Modern production agriculture
is highly dependent

01:24:49.626 --> 01:24:52.628
on large amounts
of petroleum.

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:55.506
Our farm,
we're going to use

01:24:55.548 --> 01:24:58.550
about 40,000 gallons
of diesel fuel a year.

01:24:58.593 --> 01:25:01.136
We eat a lot of oil without knowing it.

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:03.639
To bring
a steer to slaughter,

01:25:03.681 --> 01:25:05.974
it's 75 gallons of oil.

01:25:06.017 --> 01:25:08.560
So what we're seeing is

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:11.146
that this
highly-efficient machine

01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:15.400
does not have the resilience
to deal with shocks

01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:18.237
such as the spike
in oil prices.

01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:21.782
Food prices
last month were 3.9% higher

01:25:21.825 --> 01:25:23.700
than they were
a year ago.

01:25:23.743 --> 01:25:25.702
Take corn, another basic
source of food,

01:25:25.745 --> 01:25:27.412
up to a 12-year high.

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:30.082
For a while, we could sell grains

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:31.708
so cheaply
anywhere in the world,

01:25:31.751 --> 01:25:34.837
farmers in other countries
who aren't being subsidized

01:25:34.879 --> 01:25:36.880
could not
compete with us.

01:25:36.923 --> 01:25:39.424
So their capacity
to grow food

01:25:39.467 --> 01:25:41.426
for themselves
was compromised.

01:25:41.469 --> 01:25:43.554
The world's running out of food

01:25:43.596 --> 01:25:46.306
and nobody's talking about it.
We have no reserves.

01:25:46.349 --> 01:25:48.517
There have been protests
around the world.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:52.062
The food crisis has already
brought down one government.

01:25:52.105 --> 01:25:54.606
A month doesn't go by

01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:56.775
where there isn't
a story in the news

01:25:56.818 --> 01:25:59.111
that peels back
the curtain

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:00.779
on how that
industrial food is made.

01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:05.409
Downer cows-- too ill or lame to walk--

01:26:05.451 --> 01:26:08.370
being brutalized to get them
to their feet for slaughter.

01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:11.331
Millions of gallons
of concentrated hog manure

01:26:11.374 --> 01:26:13.959
flushing their contents downriver.

01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:15.794
Government's food czar reported

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:18.046
that there are no tools
in place to track

01:26:18.089 --> 01:26:21.258
the origin of the latest
salmonella outbreak.

01:26:21.301 --> 01:26:24.761
Every time one of these
stories comes out,

01:26:24.804 --> 01:26:26.889
America learns
a little bit more--

01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:29.892
what's going on in the kitchen
where their food is being prepared.

01:26:29.934 --> 01:26:34.313
And every time
they turn away in revulsion

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:36.523
and start looking
for alternatives.

01:26:44.282 --> 01:26:46.325
The irony is that
the average consumer

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:48.368
does not feel
very powerful.

01:26:48.411 --> 01:26:50.787
They think
they are the recipients

01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:53.081
of whatever industry
has put out there

01:26:53.124 --> 01:26:54.666
for them to consume.

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:56.543
Trust me,
it's the exact opposite.

01:26:57.712 --> 01:27:00.214
When we run an item past
the supermarket scanner,

01:27:00.256 --> 01:27:03.675
we're voting for local
or not, organic or not.

01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:07.137
At Wal-Mart, we made
a decision about a year ago

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:10.474
to go through a process of becoming
rBST-free in our milk supply.

01:27:10.516 --> 01:27:12.976
We made that decision based
on customer preference.

01:27:13.019 --> 01:27:15.312
Individual consumers

01:27:15.355 --> 01:27:17.439
changed the biggest
company on earth

01:27:17.482 --> 01:27:19.233
and in so doing,

01:27:19.275 --> 01:27:21.860
probably put the last nail
in the coffin

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:23.487
for synthetic
growth hormone.

01:27:25.114 --> 01:27:27.282
To eat well
in this country costs more

01:27:27.325 --> 01:27:30.577
than to eat badly.
It will take more money

01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:32.287
and some people simply
don't have it.

01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:33.914
And that's one
of the reasons

01:27:33.957 --> 01:27:35.874
that we need changes
at the policy level,

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:38.877
so that the carrots are
a better deal than the chips.

01:27:41.005 --> 01:27:43.090
People think
"These companies are so big

01:27:43.132 --> 01:27:45.884
and so powerful, how are we ever going
to change things?"

01:27:45.927 --> 01:27:47.761
But look at
the tobacco industry.

01:27:47.804 --> 01:27:51.014
It had huge control
over public policy

01:27:51.057 --> 01:27:53.308
and that control
was broken.

01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:56.770
The battle against tobacco
is a perfect model

01:27:56.813 --> 01:28:00.315
of how an industry's
irresponsible behavior

01:28:00.358 --> 01:28:02.276
can be changed.

01:28:04.654 --> 01:28:08.240
Imagine what it would be if,
as a national policy,

01:28:08.283 --> 01:28:11.410
we said we would be
only successful

01:28:11.452 --> 01:28:14.538
if we had
fewer people going

01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:17.457
to the hospital
next year than last year.

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:20.460
How about that
for success?

01:28:20.503 --> 01:28:22.504
The idea then
would be to have

01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:24.131
such nutritionally dense

01:28:24.173 --> 01:28:25.632
unadulterated food

01:28:25.675 --> 01:28:29.219
that people who ate it
actually felt better,

01:28:29.262 --> 01:28:31.138
had more energy,

01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:33.849
and weren't sick as much.

01:28:33.891 --> 01:28:36.184
Now see,
that's a noble goal.

01:28:37.353 --> 01:28:39.604
I can't change the fact
that Kevin's dead.

01:28:41.441 --> 01:28:43.817
When you tell somebody
you've lost a child,

01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:46.236
I really don't like
that look of pity

01:28:46.279 --> 01:28:48.113
that comes
into their eyes,

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:50.907
that they feel
sorry for me.

01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:53.368
I can have a pity party
all by myself very well,

01:28:53.411 --> 01:28:56.621
thank you.
I don't need it from other people.

01:28:56.664 --> 01:28:58.582
What I need
them to do is listen

01:28:58.624 --> 01:29:00.542
and help me
effect a change.

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:04.755
You have to understand
that we farmers,

01:29:04.797 --> 01:29:08.800
we're gonna deliver to the marketplace
what the marketplace demands.

01:29:08.843 --> 01:29:11.094
If you want
to buy $2 milk,

01:29:11.137 --> 01:29:15.098
you're gonna get a feedlot
in the backyard. It's that simple.

01:29:15.141 --> 01:29:17.517
People have got
to start demanding

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:19.936
good, wholesome
food of us.

01:29:19.979 --> 01:29:21.605
And we'll deliver.
I promise you.

01:29:21.647 --> 01:29:24.524
We're very ingenious people.
We'll deliver.

01:29:24.567 --> 01:29:27.027
