WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:03.838
<i>Previously on</i> Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.005 --> 00:07.258
I understood that conceptually,
we were building a world, but I...

00:07.466 --> 00:09.677
I didn't expect you would build
our entire world.

00:10.094 --> 00:12.555
You heard Radcliffe. He said,
he had a subject in the Framework,

00:13.097 --> 00:14.140
someone who was thriving.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.267
He was talking about May.
She's alive.

00:16.767 --> 00:20.730
I believe it is responsible for all,
of the alien problems on this planet.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.565
- What is it?
- A man.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.984
He is always there in the shadows.

00:26.277 --> 00:28.195
The Russians. They're here for us.

00:35.036 --> 00:37.038
We have the Inhuman Director
of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.685
- Well, I'll be.
- Oh!

01:01.979 --> 01:02.980
That hurt.

01:08.027 --> 01:09.028
Yeah, it hurts.

01:09.278 --> 01:11.363
The fact that I feel anything at all
is what's blowing my mind.

01:14.658 --> 01:15.618
Think that's the point.

01:34.220 --> 01:35.221
All right, that's enough.

01:38.057 --> 01:39.683
- Well?
- Unbelievable.

01:40.684 --> 01:41.727
It's like the real thing.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.229
- Oh!
- I could even smell the sweat.

01:43.813 --> 01:45.397
But, I... I felt strangely cold, though.

01:45.564 --> 01:47.399
Well, I tried to make the simulation
as real as possible,

01:47.483 --> 01:49.401
and since you always leave
the air-con on in the base,

01:49.735 --> 01:50.736
I exaggerated it.

01:50.986 --> 01:54.156
- Kind of like a silent protest.
- That was so realistic.

01:54.490 --> 01:56.700
I mean, you know, except for the whole
stopping in mid-air thing.

01:56.867 --> 01:59.120
I don't know. I think it might play out
a little differently in real life.

01:59.411 --> 02:01.038
So, you can feel in there?

02:01.413 --> 02:04.667
Yeah, well, it's the Framework.
It's an immersive sensory experience.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.669
It was designed as a training exercise,

02:06.877 --> 02:09.964
a way for agents to practice sparring
or jungle insertions and the like.

02:10.172 --> 02:11.924
Yeah, you can still feel pain
while inside.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.677
That's why I stopped the simulation,
before you hit the wall because...

02:14.885 --> 02:15.928
Painful. Got it.

02:16.095 --> 02:17.429
So, May's locked up somewhere,

02:17.721 --> 02:19.890
but being held,
in a virtual reality like this?

02:20.474 --> 02:23.769
- What, to keep her placid?
- Radcliffe said she was in the Framework.

02:23.936 --> 02:27.231
Yeah, but this is a contained prototype.
It's got limited simulations.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.525
If Radcliffe said he built a world,

02:29.650 --> 02:31.861
he must have built a separate,
more powerful version.

02:32.027 --> 02:33.487
But if it's separate, how will we find it

02:33.571 --> 02:34.530
Run a search.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.615
Try and locate, traces of the source code.

02:36.699 --> 02:39.952
I might be able to locate where Radcliffe,
is running his new version, and...

02:40.035 --> 02:41.036
And that's where we'll find May.

02:41.537 --> 02:44.707
Sir, the GPS signal
we're tracking on the Director's suit?

02:45.124 --> 02:46.417
We've locked in on the location.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.419
- Where?
- Nome, Alaska.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.109
Coulson.

03:21.619 --> 03:22.620
What the hell is this?

03:30.377 --> 03:32.671
It's... you.

04:32.273 --> 04:33.315
Doctor.

04:37.695 --> 04:38.696
Radcliffe.

04:40.406 --> 04:43.617
Unless your intention is to shred
the most advanced human mind of this,

04:43.742 --> 04:44.827
or any century,

04:45.202 --> 04:46.412
I suggest you think twice,

04:46.578 --> 04:48.664
before forcefully removing him
from the Framework.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.249
And unless you would like
to lose your arm,

04:50.416 --> 04:51.917
I suggest you let me go.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.299
I need to speak with him.

04:58.549 --> 05:01.260
Dr Radcliffe, has allowed me
to communicate on his behalf.

05:01.427 --> 05:02.428
I need to speak with him.

05:03.846 --> 05:04.722
Now.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.314
Aida, what have I told you,
about pulling me out of...

05:15.357 --> 05:16.692
Yeah.

05:18.235 --> 05:21.030
You interrupted, a rousing discourse
on pre-weekend Godard versus...

05:21.280 --> 05:24.616
You spend too much time,
as of late in your fantasy land, Doctor.

05:25.534 --> 05:27.328
I need you here. Present.

05:29.288 --> 05:32.041
Well, the marvellous benefit
of an autonomous system

05:32.249 --> 05:36.253
is that things get done without the need
for constant managing and meddling.

05:36.420 --> 05:37.546
I do not meddle.

05:38.297 --> 05:39.340
I perfect.

05:40.257 --> 05:42.051
You're a results man.
I appreciate that.

05:42.926 --> 05:45.679
But I've done my part here.
The hardware is in place.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.474
Aida is on hand to ensure
the transition goes smoothly.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.434
I did not make an alliance with that.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.394
Aida is my proxy.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.980
View her as an extension of myself.

05:58.400 --> 06:03.906
Now, you will get what you want most.
Please, leave me to what I want most.

06:08.452 --> 06:09.453
I can assure you,

06:09.953 --> 06:11.830
everything will go according to plan.

06:12.748 --> 06:14.249
For your sake, it'd better.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.507
This is why I don't have Facebook.

06:22.925 --> 06:25.010
Not subtle. This is a message.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.429
He wants me to find something here.

06:28.472 --> 06:30.682
But it's just a bad episode of
<i>This is Your life.</i>

06:31.016 --> 06:32.684
- Your life and his.
- Huh?

06:33.018 --> 06:34.728
You see the mining facility
in this picture?

06:35.396 --> 06:36.480
He owns it.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.524
Purchased by Anton Ivanov,
this year.

06:38.816 --> 06:40.442
It's the only thing here
that ties back to him.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.861
Does it tie back to you, too?

06:44.780 --> 06:45.823
Yeah.

07:13.892 --> 07:14.893
UN?

07:29.575 --> 07:32.035
If that guy doesn't have a cat,
he'd be really confused.

07:32.244 --> 07:33.537
May, what the hell are you doing here?

07:33.745 --> 07:35.122
I didn't request a specialist.

07:35.747 --> 07:36.915
I go where I'm assigned.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.461
Yeah, well, I got this handled.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.963
- I don't need you throwing off my game.
- You have game?

07:43.088 --> 07:46.175
I have what some people refer to
in certain parts of the world as "game."

07:46.258 --> 07:47.676
It's cute that you think that.

07:49.303 --> 07:50.471
Impertinent.

07:51.013 --> 07:52.055
Car.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.693
<i>Earth to Coulson.</i>

08:07.029 --> 08:08.071
Do you know, what this means?

08:10.449 --> 08:11.575
It means we're going to Russia.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.733
It's good to see
there's still some fight left in you.

09:28.485 --> 09:31.738
But I should expect as much
from S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Inhuman Director.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.949
You're the one they take orders from.

09:34.741 --> 09:35.742
<i>Da.</i>

09:36.118 --> 09:38.912
Then I'm placing you under arrest
in the name of S.H.I.E.L.D.

09:40.122 --> 09:42.040
Oh. With what power?

09:44.209 --> 09:46.336
Surely, you have used the last of yours.

09:48.714 --> 09:49.840
You want to find out?

09:52.009 --> 09:53.010
<i>Da.</i>

10:13.739 --> 10:15.240
I know you can do better than that.

10:17.784 --> 10:18.785
Put him back in.

10:28.712 --> 10:31.214
I like my video games
as much as you, Turbo, but...

10:31.590 --> 10:32.591
...this...

10:34.092 --> 10:35.636
- this is too much.
- Yeah, well,

10:35.969 --> 10:38.513
it's not a bloody Oculus Rift.
It's a training exercise.

10:39.514 --> 10:42.559
Yeah, well, I doubt it's helping May
run a triathlon.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.603
- Mack...
- That's not how I meant it.

10:45.103 --> 10:48.482
You built a <i>Matrix</i> prison
and now May's stuck in it like <i>Brainscan.</i>

10:48.690 --> 10:49.900
The Framework is a tool.

10:50.525 --> 10:53.737
- That's all that it is, a tool.
- Hmm. Like Aida was a tool?

10:56.073 --> 10:57.491
What are you trying to say?
That all this is my fault?

10:57.616 --> 11:00.702
What I'm saying is if you didn't build
a killer robot or a virtual world

11:00.827 --> 11:02.412
this year would've been
much easier for us.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.831
Now, whether you like it or not,
that's the reality.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.375
I'm trying to help people, Mack.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.877
I know you're not a bad person,
Fitz, but, this...

11:09.544 --> 11:11.713
gear has been used,
for some really bad things.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.549
You've got to think about the implications
of what you create.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.427
Electricity is used to execute criminals.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.429
Does that mean, we also shouldn't
use it to power our hospitals?

11:19.513 --> 11:20.681
Not the same thing, and you know it.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.057
There's always risks involved in science.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.642
That doesn't mean,
that we don't pursue it anyway.

11:23.850 --> 11:24.851
Okay, you know,

11:25.435 --> 11:28.855
the line between scientist
and mad scientist is paper thin.

11:29.231 --> 11:30.232
And right now...

11:30.899 --> 11:32.192
you're starting to sound
an awful lot like...

11:32.275 --> 11:33.276
Don't.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.070
Don't you even say his name.

11:39.241 --> 11:40.826
We've cloaked and entered
Russian airspace.

11:41.284 --> 11:42.744
T-minus five minutes to the drop zone.

11:45.414 --> 11:46.748
You're one of the smartest people I know.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.127
I really hope you figure this one out.

12:12.524 --> 12:13.900
What was the mission
you were on here?

12:14.985 --> 12:16.862
May and I were sent to retrieve an 084.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.072
Years and years ago.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.783
With May?
That can't be a coincidence.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.254
So, your plan was to ask the guard
to let you in?

12:34.504 --> 12:36.131
You know how persuasive I can be.

12:41.219 --> 12:44.431
Can you even say, "Please open
the door for me," in Russian?

12:45.140 --> 12:46.141
Almost.

12:46.475 --> 12:48.727
But I do know, a few choice words
I have for you right now.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.313
You can't bluff, Phil.
You've got nine different tells,

12:51.563 --> 12:54.524
- eyes darting all over the place.
- That's not true.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.110
I maintain eye contact at all times.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.241
You should try sunglasses.

13:07.329 --> 13:08.371
Clear.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.753
You did this. You jinxed us.

13:15.420 --> 13:18.089
- You literally willed this into existence.
- What?

13:18.632 --> 13:21.510
They don't cover safe-cracking
at the Communications Academy?

13:22.511 --> 13:24.930
Don't worry. I have got this one hundred
percent under...

13:26.139 --> 13:27.432
Shut up.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.894
- Don't worry. I'm good with my hands.
- Not how I remember it.

13:31.269 --> 13:34.272
Okay, here it comes.
Never long before you bring that up.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.316
Well, I remember you fumbling
quite a bit.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.944
I didn't know you that well back then.
I didn't want to be presumptuous...

13:39.110 --> 13:40.529
You were undercover, as my husband.

13:40.654 --> 13:44.199
Right, and I knew we were on camera,
so I had to sell that we were, you know...

13:44.366 --> 13:45.492
Oh, yeah, you sold it.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.536
Took over two minutes
to unhook my bra.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.621
That was an act for the camera.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.915
You know, I was...
I was being a gentleman.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.501
What, they don't cover foreplay
at the Operations Academy?

13:54.668 --> 13:57.796
They teach us to commit to the mission,
all the way.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.507
Well, I'm sorry you took it so personally.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.385
Spy life can be confusing sometimes,
I know.

14:05.554 --> 14:08.098
Come on, can I please have
some light here?

14:11.184 --> 14:12.561
That's why I only date civilians.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.896
You know, makes things simpler.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.399
Agreed. Till they start asking questions.

14:17.649 --> 14:20.068
Agreed. I seem to go through men
like paper towels.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.236
Agreed.

14:21.736 --> 14:22.946
Or, so I've heard.

14:26.283 --> 14:27.284
We've got company.

14:30.495 --> 14:31.538
Security?

14:34.624 --> 14:37.294
Looks like SVR Agents.
Four of them.

14:46.177 --> 14:47.262
You did this?

14:47.929 --> 14:50.098
Not me. May.

14:50.432 --> 14:51.433
What do you think's in there?

14:53.184 --> 14:54.811
Well, we already have the suit.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.939
Let's hope it's not
the Director's body this time.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.410
My father worked an oil drill.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.288
He was a son of a bitch,

15:13.455 --> 15:16.041
but he worked hard for not much,
so I admire him.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.795
The richest man in my town,
on the other hand...

15:21.922 --> 15:24.591
inherited his money
from his father who built airplanes.

15:26.468 --> 15:27.928
He wore furs, was entitled.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.723
When I saw my father with this man...

15:32.849 --> 15:33.892
complimenting him...

15:34.768 --> 15:36.269
licking his boots...

15:37.520 --> 15:40.690
my admiration for my father
evaporated.

15:42.609 --> 15:46.029
You see, there is something
lower than scum.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.990
That which strives to be it.

15:53.662 --> 15:54.704
Like you.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.875
You allow S.H.I.E.L.D. to fill
your veins with poison

15:59.292 --> 16:01.544
and parade you around
as an example.

16:02.796 --> 16:03.797
Of what?

16:21.147 --> 16:23.274
S.H.I.E.L.D. claims,
to be a beacon for humanity.

16:23.692 --> 16:26.444
What it really is
is a safe haven for inhumanity.

16:28.113 --> 16:29.155
They...

16:30.448 --> 16:31.616
will come for me.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.786
That is the plan.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.216
Preparations here
are nearly completed.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.177
That is nearly a satisfying report.

16:51.761 --> 16:55.140
If you're done playing with your food,
there is still work to be done.

16:58.101 --> 16:59.102
Metaphor.

17:00.061 --> 17:01.104
Well done.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.941
Do my methods disturb you?

17:05.358 --> 17:08.153
Do you feel sympathy for the thing
you attempt to emulate?

17:08.528 --> 17:10.821
I was programmed to observe
human behaviour.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.825
Yours is different...

17:14.659 --> 17:18.663
than most I have experienced.
I have no opinion on you or your methods.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.124
That is because you cannot have opinions.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.252
You are... fake.

17:26.171 --> 17:27.505
Just like that man in there.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.507
And when will you be done
with the Director?

17:29.799 --> 17:31.301
Once he serves his purpose.

17:37.307 --> 17:39.934
Even filth has a purpose.

17:57.368 --> 17:58.828
What the hell is this?

18:14.260 --> 18:15.553
<i>Agent Coulson, I presume.</i>

18:15.929 --> 18:16.971
Do you know who I am?

18:17.138 --> 18:19.099
The sick son of a bitch
who kidnapped my people

18:19.349 --> 18:21.768
and seems to have more than
a few skeletons in his closet?

18:22.018 --> 18:23.478
Do you not recognise these men?

18:23.937 --> 18:25.897
- Should I?
<i>- Yes, you should.</i>

18:26.648 --> 18:27.774
Because you had them killed.

18:34.906 --> 18:37.242
Four guys at once. Should be fun.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.535
What? No.

18:39.244 --> 18:42.455
No guns-blazing tactics, Rambo.
We're spies, not soldiers.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.457
We're agents.
We do what has to be done.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.836
- The mission comes before the man.
- What are your orders, anyway?

18:48.586 --> 18:50.588
Are you here to back me up,
or to retrieve the 084?

18:50.797 --> 18:52.090
My orders don't include telling you.

18:53.174 --> 18:55.301
- What's your clearance level now, anyway?
- Three.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.554
- Why, what level are you?
- Mine's classified.

18:57.971 --> 19:01.266
Tell you what? I'll stall Stalin
and the gang. You stay here, get the 084.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.894
Sure. What are you gonna
say to them, anyway?

19:05.103 --> 19:08.606
There's a, bio-hazard contamination.
Bio always works.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.192
Not inspiring confidence.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.240
Hey. Hi! Oh, boy.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.243
Please tell me one of you speaks English.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.579
<i>- Da.</i>
- Well, that's not really...

19:24.122 --> 19:26.499
Whatever.
I'm with the UN task force here.

19:26.875 --> 19:30.086
Some biohazardous materials
were unearthed on this site.

19:30.587 --> 19:31.588
Really dangerous stuff.

19:31.713 --> 19:33.673
- You have paper?
- I do indeed, yes.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.599
Come on, May.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.435
I didn't kill these men.

19:45.977 --> 19:48.146
<i>They were interrogated,
tortured, and executed,</i>

19:48.396 --> 19:49.439
all to cover up for you.

19:49.981 --> 19:52.859
<i>They were my comrades.
They were my brothers.</i>

19:53.109 --> 19:56.070
I had to dig up their bodies
just to pay my respects.

19:57.906 --> 19:58.990
Never forget the fallen.

19:59.574 --> 20:00.617
Where are my people?

20:00.867 --> 20:03.912
<i>Your people will suffer,
the exact same fate as my unit.</i>

20:04.996 --> 20:07.624
Only this time, there will be no one left
to find their bodies.

20:13.922 --> 20:14.964
You see?

20:15.840 --> 20:19.636
Yours is not the only life
Agent Coulson has so easily tossed aside

20:20.136 --> 20:21.137
or hidden behind.

20:21.679 --> 20:22.972
This is what he does.

20:23.431 --> 20:24.766
Everything is his S.H.I.E.L.D.

20:25.183 --> 20:26.976
The government, behind you, Director,

20:27.310 --> 20:31.231
behind Nick Fury, Stark, all of it,
stands Agent Coulson,

20:31.481 --> 20:34.067
quietly pursuing his alien agenda.

20:34.317 --> 20:35.860
Conspiracy theories...

20:37.237 --> 20:39.280
from the man who literally mounted,

20:39.447 --> 20:42.784
a conspiracy
to have men in masks kill Inhumans.

20:43.201 --> 20:44.869
I'm closing the door he opened,

20:45.411 --> 20:48.331
allowing alien races
to infect our world...

20:49.040 --> 20:50.917
and convincing men like you,
to protect them.

20:52.168 --> 20:56.923
And I will make you admit,
to me and yourself, that this is true.

21:04.514 --> 21:06.349
- You have a match?
- I'm searching fragments of code,

21:06.599 --> 21:07.976
across all lines of communication.

21:08.309 --> 21:10.478
Now, it was going slow at first,
but once I found the right fragment...

21:11.145 --> 21:12.355
Ah, there it is.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.440
We're going to find them.

21:15.483 --> 21:16.734
Let's not run before we can walk.

21:16.985 --> 21:19.153
But all I need to do
is trace the source, and...

21:21.322 --> 21:24.617
- Server farm in China.
- China? Makes perfect sense.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.036
Hold on a minute. No.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.624
- That's not right.
- What's going on?

21:32.125 --> 21:33.960
It appears to be pinging
from multiple sources.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.338
Cell phones in Atlanta,
a military base in Norfolk...

21:37.797 --> 21:38.923
Does this mean...

21:40.258 --> 21:41.301
Fitz.

21:48.433 --> 21:49.434
What the hell is this?

21:49.642 --> 21:51.269
It's the Framework code,
and it's worse than I feared.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.689
We traced where the data
is being processed. It's everywhere.

21:55.023 --> 21:57.233
- What do you mean everywhere?
- The code is piggybacking

21:57.358 --> 21:59.319
on the processors of devices
from all over the world.

21:59.485 --> 22:02.697
- It's like SETI, only you don't opt in.
- Oh, my God.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.991
If Radcliffe is using
this much processing power,

22:05.241 --> 22:07.452
- the Framework reality could be...
- Massive.

22:07.702 --> 22:08.870
So you can't track its origin?

22:09.495 --> 22:11.289
Not yet. It doesn't stay
in any one device long enough.

22:11.914 --> 22:14.792
- How is all this even possible?
- 'Cause Radcliffe has the Darkhold.

22:15.710 --> 22:16.919
Anything's possible.

22:17.545 --> 22:19.422
Well, find it. Find something.

22:19.881 --> 22:21.215
We don't leave our people behind.

22:24.886 --> 22:25.928
We all good here, fellas?

22:26.095 --> 22:27.805
What else do you need?
Birth certificate?

22:27.972 --> 22:30.058
I think I got a membership card
to Gold's Gym.

22:30.183 --> 22:31.184
You have backup?

22:31.392 --> 22:32.894
I think that's the only copy,
I have on me,

22:32.977 --> 22:34.354
but there might be another one in the van.

22:34.479 --> 22:35.563
Do you have partner?

22:35.688 --> 22:37.940
Oh! Yeah. She's not really a partner.

22:38.524 --> 22:41.152
More of a friend... a co-worker, really.
Though, to be honest,

22:41.736 --> 22:44.030
I'm starting to feel some tension,
sexual and otherwise,

22:44.489 --> 22:46.157
so I was actually thinking
about taking a shot,

22:46.324 --> 22:47.992
but I'm afraid it could go south.

22:48.242 --> 22:50.411
You Americans, you talk too much.

22:51.204 --> 22:53.664
- It's our greatest flaw.
- Our unit has been made aware,

22:54.165 --> 22:56.000
that an item was found on the premises.

22:56.834 --> 22:57.960
We have been sent to retrieve it.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.796
Okay.

22:59.921 --> 23:02.256
At any cost.

23:29.200 --> 23:32.412
Looks like your partner was asked
to retrieve the item at any cost, as well.

23:32.995 --> 23:35.206
And that cost... is you.

23:42.171 --> 23:44.966
Okay, so we think we found
the next clue in this fun, little game.

23:45.216 --> 23:49.011
Ivanov mentioned this SVR unit,
being tortured and executed.

23:49.262 --> 23:51.681
And that he was gonna do
the exact same thing to us.

23:52.223 --> 23:55.935
So, I looked up SVR detention centres
connected to the unit number,

23:56.227 --> 23:58.187
found on the dead agents' uniforms.

23:58.813 --> 24:00.898
And this one right here,

24:01.357 --> 24:04.485
was a front during
the Cold War for a submarine base.

24:04.569 --> 24:07.822
And since, we know Ivanov has a submarine,
like all good Bond villains...

24:08.114 --> 24:10.366
We're already en route to the base
in Krasnoyarsk Krai.

24:13.202 --> 24:14.871
Let's assume the enemy knows
we're coming.

24:15.913 --> 24:17.331
They've been baiting us this whole time.

24:18.374 --> 24:19.750
We may face strong opposition,

24:20.126 --> 24:23.880
trap doors, sharks with lasers, who knows?
It doesn't matter.

24:25.214 --> 24:28.259
What matters is getting our people back,
so let's get ready.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.729
We found where they're keeping
the Director and May.

24:40.730 --> 24:42.231
Already en route to the location.

24:48.529 --> 24:50.740
- We're going to save them.
- What if we can't?

24:51.657 --> 24:54.285
What if May suffers from permanent
cognitive dysfunction,

24:54.577 --> 24:55.912
or cerebral atrophy?

24:56.496 --> 24:58.039
- Or she dies?
- Fitz.

24:58.289 --> 25:00.333
We don't know the adverse effects
this could have on her brain.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.418
I did it to her.

25:03.127 --> 25:05.171
Aida, the Framework...

25:06.255 --> 25:08.716
my fingerprints are all over
these murder weapons.

25:11.802 --> 25:12.762
Mack was right.

25:13.387 --> 25:14.388
Mack was right.

25:15.848 --> 25:19.143
You do need to think about
the implications of the things you create.

25:20.061 --> 25:23.648
But just because
someone uses your ideas for evil

25:23.773 --> 25:26.526
does not make it your fault
for creating it in the first place.

25:27.276 --> 25:30.154
You make things
from the genius of your mind

25:30.363 --> 25:33.366
and the goodness of your heart
to help people.

25:34.492 --> 25:36.744
Don't let Radcliffe's actions
corrupt that.

25:37.787 --> 25:40.748
You are not responsible
for the twisted things he's done.

25:42.124 --> 25:43.334
Wrongs have been committed.

25:43.751 --> 25:46.337
Now we make them right... together.

25:51.342 --> 25:53.970
You know, if Radcliffe is operating
out of this facility,

25:54.303 --> 25:55.972
there may be some
Framework hardware there.

25:58.641 --> 26:01.727
If I could tap into that directly, then...

26:03.354 --> 26:05.982
maybe I could find the key
to shutting it down for good.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.360
There he is.

26:11.028 --> 26:12.113
Let's get to it already.

26:14.031 --> 26:16.117
This is your last chance, Director,

26:16.576 --> 26:19.370
to denounce S.H.I.E.L.D.
and all that it has done.

26:20.663 --> 26:21.914
Now I ask you...

26:23.666 --> 26:24.834
one last time.

26:28.546 --> 26:30.131
Do you have any regrets?

26:32.550 --> 26:34.010
I believe in Agent Coulson.

26:35.219 --> 26:36.345
I believe in S.H.I.E.L.D.

26:37.513 --> 26:39.181
Because for all its imperfections,

26:39.682 --> 26:42.727
it strives to do the right thing,
to protect people.

26:43.394 --> 26:47.523
You claim to fight for others,
for humanity.

26:49.358 --> 26:51.402
I think you lost yours a long time ago.

26:51.902 --> 26:54.780
And to answer your question,
I do have one regret.

26:56.032 --> 26:58.909
That I don't have any superpowers
of my own, that I could use...

26:59.869 --> 27:03.414
to kick your ass!

27:04.332 --> 27:07.376
I can respect a man who stands
behind his true beliefs.

27:12.506 --> 27:14.133
Misguided though they may be.

27:16.093 --> 27:17.136
You know...

27:20.097 --> 27:21.682
it is a shame we find ourselves

27:21.849 --> 27:24.018
on opposite sides of the board
in this game.

27:28.814 --> 27:29.982
But you are a pawn.

27:32.693 --> 27:33.944
The pawn can only move forward.

27:35.571 --> 27:37.657
Personally, I can overlook your sins.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.953
But, my comrades...

27:43.913 --> 27:48.668
Well, let's just say,
they are less forgiving than I am.

28:46.517 --> 28:47.852
Communications room at sub-basement.

28:48.018 --> 28:49.186
- Fitz, Simmons.
- On it.

28:49.437 --> 28:51.939
Davis, you're with them.
The rest of us will fan out,

28:52.106 --> 28:54.775
search this place top to bottom,
for Director Mace and Agent May.

28:54.984 --> 28:58.237
Stay on comms. Be sharp.
Morales, you're with me.

29:10.499 --> 29:13.627
Special Agent, Phillip J. Coulson.

29:14.879 --> 29:19.300
I have waited a long time
for a face-to-face.

29:19.633 --> 29:22.970
You know, most people
would've brought something nice.

29:24.305 --> 29:25.181
Flowers.

29:25.347 --> 29:27.683
Ah, humour is the last line
of defence you have left.

29:28.559 --> 29:31.562
There is no one to stand behind.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.899
No one left to protect you.

29:35.316 --> 29:38.152
I don't know. I'm pretty capable
of protecting myself.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.864
You have enhanced yourself, I'm sure.
I'd be a fool to expect anything else.

29:42.239 --> 29:45.868
Enhanced humans,
aliens and their technology...

29:47.036 --> 29:50.748
The deeper I dug, I found there was
one man at the centre of it all...

29:51.916 --> 29:53.000
You.

30:28.494 --> 30:29.954
I thought the mission came before the man.

30:30.079 --> 30:33.123
Did you really think, I was gonna leave
your defenceless ass behind?

30:33.415 --> 30:36.460
- Yes. Yes, I one hundred percent did.
- I let you sweat a little.

30:37.461 --> 30:40.256
But... I didn't want to make
you wait around forever.

30:41.382 --> 30:42.633
Let's get the hell out of here.

30:44.051 --> 30:46.470
You were one of the SVR Agents
at the mining facility.

30:46.929 --> 30:48.514
- That was your unit.
<i>- Da.</i>

30:48.806 --> 30:52.893
And they were killed, for not retrieving
the object stolen from our soil.

30:53.561 --> 30:56.564
When I looked for who did,
I found S.H.I.E.L.D.

30:56.939 --> 30:59.316
And after years of looking
behind S.H.I.E.L.D., I found you.

31:00.818 --> 31:02.736
That face.

31:03.737 --> 31:06.031
The man there at the very beginning.

31:06.699 --> 31:07.825
What a coincidence.

31:08.117 --> 31:12.121
I'm sorry. I don't really have time
for all this, conspiracy-theorist crap.

31:12.288 --> 31:15.499
I'm done playing games.
Where are May and Mace?

31:15.708 --> 31:17.084
But play my games you will.

31:18.669 --> 31:21.714
Did you really think, I would let you have
what it is you seek at the end?

31:23.465 --> 31:26.510
- They're not even here, are they?
- Well, your pretend Inhuman director

31:26.677 --> 31:28.095
is in the compound, but...

31:29.013 --> 31:31.557
he may be dead
by the time you find him.

31:32.349 --> 31:36.562
All of these things you've done,
all of the energy spent, the hatred.

31:37.062 --> 31:38.731
And you know
what the funny thing about it is?

31:41.025 --> 31:42.568
I have no idea who the hell you are.

31:42.943 --> 31:45.195
I've been on hundreds
of missions in my time.

31:45.571 --> 31:49.366
This one you're so upset about,
I was sent to retrieve an object.

31:50.409 --> 31:53.412
If I'm being honest,
I don't even remember what it was.

31:54.038 --> 31:55.080
As far as I'm concerned,

31:55.497 --> 31:58.083
you're just another Redshirt
like so many others

31:58.292 --> 32:01.587
who tried unsuccessfully,
to stop me from saving the world.

32:02.796 --> 32:03.881
'Cause that's what I do.

32:04.924 --> 32:07.384
So, cool origin story, bro...

32:08.135 --> 32:09.762
but this means nothing to me.

32:17.311 --> 32:18.604
She, on the other hand...

32:20.230 --> 32:21.857
The top Watchdog himself.

32:23.233 --> 32:25.861
I've been waiting a long time,
for a face-to-face.

32:38.374 --> 32:43.420
I chased the Watchdogs, the funding,
the weapons, the EMP, the senator...

32:44.421 --> 32:47.925
- it all leads back to you.
- Always nice to meet an admirer.

32:48.092 --> 32:51.470
This isn't about admiration...
or forgiveness.

32:51.679 --> 32:55.015
The butcher does not seek forgiveness
from the animals he slaughters.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.685
- Have you ever read <i>Animal Farm</i> ?
- Enough talk.

32:58.185 --> 32:59.603
Not a fair fight, but...

33:00.771 --> 33:03.691
I will fight it, regardless.

33:21.750 --> 33:24.253
This can't be Radcliffe's Framework setup.
It's too low-tech.

33:24.420 --> 33:26.380
Maybe we can still find
something useful anyway.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.382
I'll copy any data I find in the system.

33:29.550 --> 33:31.260
We should take some of this equipment
back to the base,

33:31.343 --> 33:32.553
for further examination, as well.

33:33.095 --> 33:35.055
Anything could be the key
we're searching for.

33:35.222 --> 33:38.017
<i>We have an Aida
sighting on the lower levels of the base.</i>

33:39.018 --> 33:39.935
Aida's here.

33:42.312 --> 33:43.772
You do this, I'll find Aida.

33:44.023 --> 33:45.399
What, you're gonna go take
on a killer android?

33:47.818 --> 33:48.861
I'll take Davis.

33:49.278 --> 33:51.989
- Concern only slightly lessened.
- Thanks.

33:53.073 --> 33:56.368
We can't let her escape.
She could be the lead we're looking for.

33:58.120 --> 34:01.040
All right. Just... be careful.

34:02.583 --> 34:03.709
Davis, with me.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.779
- You all right?
- Yeah. But I don't know about him.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.364
He's breathing, but barely.

34:36.033 --> 34:37.743
Jeffrey, where's May?
Where are they keeping her?

34:39.244 --> 34:40.829
Come on.
We got to get him out of here.

35:09.024 --> 35:12.569
I've been looking forward
to facing one of you, readying myself.

35:13.445 --> 35:14.613
I strive for perfection.

35:15.572 --> 35:18.033
- You are a genetic cheater.
- I'm not a cheater.

35:18.659 --> 35:20.410
You're just playing by the old rules.

35:28.752 --> 35:29.753
The game has changed.

35:35.926 --> 35:38.303
Ivanov's down. Where is everybody?

35:42.766 --> 35:44.101
- Anything?
- No luck.

35:44.309 --> 35:47.146
We've been running all over
this place. It's a bloody labyrinth.

35:47.437 --> 35:48.897
Pray we don't run into the Goblin King.

35:49.940 --> 35:53.026
Can anyone hear me?
Has anyone spotted Aida?

35:54.236 --> 35:55.612
Still no response.

35:58.031 --> 36:00.159
Oh, no, no, no. The submarine.

36:01.743 --> 36:03.370
She's escaping.

36:24.641 --> 36:26.059
We're too late.

36:28.020 --> 36:29.813
Well, I gathered what I could
from the communications room.

36:29.980 --> 36:32.357
- Who knows what the others have found.
- Have you heard anything from them?

36:32.524 --> 36:34.735
- I've been trying to reach them.
- Yeah, me too.

36:34.985 --> 36:36.403
Comms have been wonky,
going in and out.

36:38.739 --> 36:39.781
Jemma...

36:41.742 --> 36:42.784
Director Mace!

36:43.660 --> 36:45.996
- We've been trying to reach you.
- He needs medical attention.

36:46.121 --> 36:47.331
We have to get him out of here.

36:47.456 --> 36:49.208
Finally. I've been looking
for you guys everywhere.

36:50.042 --> 36:51.919
- Where's May?
- She's not here.

36:52.127 --> 36:53.587
They must have had her on the submarine.

36:53.670 --> 36:54.796
Well, then we have to keep searching.
We...

36:54.963 --> 36:56.465
- We're pulling out.
- But, sir...

36:56.715 --> 36:58.550
We'll tend to our injured,
live to fight another day.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.319
Storm front coming in.

37:17.527 --> 37:21.031
You and I can just hunker down...
take all of this apart,

37:21.198 --> 37:23.617
until we find something
that can help us get Agent May back,

37:24.117 --> 37:25.118
yeah?

37:28.205 --> 37:29.206
Jemma?

37:30.290 --> 37:31.541
How long were we in that base?

37:33.293 --> 37:34.336
Pardon?

37:34.753 --> 37:37.005
The timetable of this mission
is bothering me.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.384
Coulson says, he came straight
down to the submarine dock

37:40.592 --> 37:41.843
after rescuing the Director.

37:42.135 --> 37:44.263
And we heard the blast,
from Daisy's battle with Ivanov

37:44.471 --> 37:46.056
long before she met up with us again.

37:47.349 --> 37:48.350
What are you saying?

37:48.976 --> 37:53.313
I'm saying, something doesn't feel right.
There's a stretch of time in there

37:53.522 --> 37:55.774
that's unaccounted for when no one
was in contact.

37:57.734 --> 37:58.777
Now you mention it...

38:01.488 --> 38:02.906
...it was pitch-dark when we left.

38:08.328 --> 38:10.330
It's the blast-door scanner system.

38:10.872 --> 38:11.873
LMD detection?

38:12.416 --> 38:13.834
- Yeah.
- What about it?

38:15.168 --> 38:17.212
It was disabled.

38:17.713 --> 38:18.755
Disabled?

38:20.215 --> 38:21.258
Recently?

38:26.013 --> 38:28.223
And the system report
was deleted from the record.

38:30.434 --> 38:31.852
Why would someone do that?

38:33.395 --> 38:34.730
- By who?
- Not sure.

38:35.105 --> 38:37.316
Luckily, my level on the spectrum
of security means,

38:37.482 --> 38:40.110
a copy of each report is sent
directly to my inbox.

38:41.111 --> 38:42.988
The system was accessed by...

38:46.033 --> 38:47.284
Coulson.

38:47.868 --> 38:48.910
Coulson?

38:51.163 --> 38:52.456
What would he want to keep from us?

38:59.046 --> 39:00.130
Fitz.

39:01.214 --> 39:02.758
- This has to be a mistake.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,

39:02.966 --> 39:04.051
wait, wait, wait, wait.

39:05.052 --> 39:06.261
Look, you said it yourself...

39:07.763 --> 39:08.889
we were in there for a while.

39:09.348 --> 39:11.183
We were separated from them
the whole time.

39:12.642 --> 39:14.770
Aida was seen at the base, and...

39:15.896 --> 39:19.775
- tanks of gas. What kind of gas?
- They left a trail of clues.

39:20.734 --> 39:22.027
They wanted to find Coulson.

39:22.652 --> 39:24.112
And while we were downstairs...

39:24.863 --> 39:26.114
They switched people out.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.203
How many?

39:37.918 --> 39:38.960
All of them.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.852
Scans indicate low levels
of life function.

39:56.686 --> 39:57.687
Good.

39:58.688 --> 40:00.023
The plan worked.

40:00.690 --> 40:02.859
We have replaced the top operatives,
at S.H.I.E.L.D.

40:04.986 --> 40:06.571
Now the next phase begins.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.282
And you will be integral to that.

40:10.784 --> 40:12.244
You have not yet served your purpose.

40:18.625 --> 40:21.253
Even filth has a purpose.

40:35.892 --> 40:37.310
- Say it.
- No.

40:38.395 --> 40:40.021
- Say it.
- I already did.

40:40.230 --> 40:41.982
Yeah, but I'm not tired of hearing it yet.

40:44.901 --> 40:47.696
- Thank you for saving my ass back there.
- You're welcome.

40:48.321 --> 40:50.782
All in all, I guess I could've
asked for a worse assignment.

40:51.241 --> 40:52.534
Wait. Asked?

40:53.285 --> 40:54.911
So, you asked for this mission, huh?

40:55.537 --> 40:56.455
Busted!

40:56.955 --> 40:58.165
Didn't want the weekend free...

40:58.748 --> 41:01.668
for quality time
with random civilian number 14?

41:01.877 --> 41:03.378
- Ugh.
- "Ugh"?

41:04.296 --> 41:06.173
Wow.
You must really like this guy.

41:08.884 --> 41:11.845
Maybe, I'm tired of dating civilians.

41:12.471 --> 41:13.513
Well...

41:15.056 --> 41:16.808
maybe if it doesn't work out
with this one...

41:17.559 --> 41:18.727
you and I can talk about that...

41:20.061 --> 41:21.188
over a drink.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.190
Chances are high.

41:23.857 --> 41:25.358
This guy is really not my type.

41:25.609 --> 41:28.361
- Already start asking questions?
- Oh, yeah. He's a shrink.

41:28.528 --> 41:30.113
Yeesh.

41:30.322 --> 41:32.157
Well, let me know if it goes horribly.

41:33.783 --> 41:34.951
Here's hoping.

41:38.455 --> 41:39.539
Keep your eyes on the road.

42:00.852 --> 42:02.103
Phil?

42:04.314 --> 42:05.649
We've waited around forever.

42:06.525 --> 42:07.567
I think that's long enough.
