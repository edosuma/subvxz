You can't just say you don't know.
That's what you said on the phone.

01:19.662 --> 01:21.872
When will you know?

01:21.915 --> 01:24.625
I...don't know.

01:24.667 --> 01:27.920
Do you want me to spend the night
somewhere else?

01:27.962 --> 01:30.380
In a hotel or something?

01:30.423 --> 01:34.718
Do you want us to meet later on?
We can talk more calmly. Do you...

01:34.761 --> 01:36.804
Do you need more time?

01:36.846 --> 01:39.681
What...? What do you need?

01:39.724 --> 01:41.350
What has happened?

01:41.392 --> 01:44.645
Bob knows that you are coming back today.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.439
Well, I can...

01:47.482 --> 01:50.818
I can pick him up after school
and take him...

01:50.860 --> 01:53.821
to the zoo or something.

02:09.002 --> 02:11.171
(BOB IMITATES SIREN)

02:11.214 --> 02:12.965
Come and admire him.

02:14.050 --> 02:16.760
BOB: Nee-na, nee-na, nee-na.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.179
Nee-na, nee-na.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.565
ANNA: Maybe all couples go through this.

02:29.607 --> 02:30.983
Yeah.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.361
One mustn't be afraid.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.654
No.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.865
One must speak honestly.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.575
Is that difficult?

02:41.077 --> 02:42.786
Is it difficult?

02:45.582 --> 02:50.419
I haven't been much help but
I've finished that job now - it's over.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.839
Maybe I was asking for too much.

02:53.882 --> 02:57.009
I was the one who had the right to ask.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.427
I know.

02:58.469 --> 02:59.970
No, you don't.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.932
Who was I doing it for, after all?

03:07.270 --> 03:10.022
Were you unfaithful to me?

03:11.983 --> 03:14.443
The truth is not really.

03:14.485 --> 03:16.361
Were you?

03:16.404 --> 03:17.446
No.

03:17.488 --> 03:19.656
There's always someone else
when these things happen.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.617
Not in this case.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.120
All right, well...

03:25.163 --> 03:27.581
What's happening to us is just...

03:27.624 --> 03:30.292
It's just natural. Feelings...

03:30.335 --> 03:32.377
change.

03:33.671 --> 03:36.924
But without you I wouldn't feel
anything at all.

03:39.802 --> 03:42.930
What do you feel now?

03:45.183 --> 03:47.476
Are you really interested?

03:50.688 --> 03:52.189
No.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.694
There you are, you see.
It's the same with me.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.529
I don't even want you now.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.324
- What time did you meet him?
- 8.30.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.243
- Where?
- In the park.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.787
- Was he willing?
- Yes, verbally.

04:06.829 --> 04:09.498
Did you sense or detect weariness in him?

04:09.540 --> 04:12.793
No. A correct appraisal of the realities.

04:12.835 --> 04:15.921
- Is it making him bitter?
- No. Greedy.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.839
But you felt his power?

04:17.882 --> 04:19.882
You mean did I feel fear?

04:19.926 --> 04:23.971
No because that would have prevented me
answering all your questions.

04:24.013 --> 04:26.723
- How many vials did he take with him?
- Two.

04:26.766 --> 04:30.102
What procedure have you devised for
contacting him again?

04:30.144 --> 04:31.561
It's all in my report.

04:31.604 --> 04:35.440
I suggest it's more economical
to fill in my successor.

04:35.483 --> 04:38.318
We don't feel there is a need
for a successor.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.028
I've completed my job.

04:40.071 --> 04:43.240
Brilliantly. That's why
we want to rehire you.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.783
It's out of the question.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.119
And what would be the reason
for your refusal?

04:47.161 --> 04:48.245
Family.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.831
- Couldn't we be of some help there?
- No.

04:50.873 --> 04:53.750
Wouldn't it be advisable for you
to reconsider?

04:53.793 --> 04:55.210
I'm unable to do that.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.212
Would you be unable for a long time?

04:57.255 --> 04:58.255
I hope not.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.883
Aren't you allowing feelings to prevent
you from answering your own questions?

05:01.926 --> 05:05.137
Exactly why I advise you
to hire my successor.

05:05.179 --> 05:06.179
Good.

05:07.265 --> 05:08.849
Any questions?

05:08.891 --> 05:10.350
No.

05:10.393 --> 05:15.147
Does our subject still wear pink socks?

05:42.425 --> 05:43.967
Anna?

06:36.437 --> 06:38.105
It's me.

06:38.147 --> 06:40.107
It's Anna?

06:40.149 --> 06:42.359
I am downtown.

06:43.528 --> 06:46.613
Why downtown? I've been waiting all day.

06:48.199 --> 06:50.158
I need some time to think.

06:50.201 --> 06:53.453
What do you mean "to think"?
Think about what?

06:53.496 --> 06:54.788
To think about me.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.998
Wh... Wh... Where are you?

06:57.041 --> 06:59.167
- When will you...?
- (PHONE CUTS OFF)

08:08.070 --> 08:09.696
(RING TONE)

08:13.868 --> 08:16.661
- Hello?
- Margie, this is Mark.

08:17.955 --> 08:21.458
Now, I know there's no sympathy
between us and it's...

08:21.501 --> 08:25.962
hard for me to ask you for help but...

08:26.005 --> 08:29.716
you're her only friend.
Now, just tell me the truth.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.593
She has somebody?

08:31.636 --> 08:35.472
She wished you'd say or do something.
Something to reinstall you.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.515
You know, a magic wave of the wand.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.808
You arrived sooner than expected, Mark.

08:39.852 --> 08:43.355
Yes, sure, this is all my fault.
Now, how long has this been going on?

08:43.397 --> 08:44.606
Quite long.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.024
Who is he?

08:46.067 --> 08:48.318
Oh, Mark! I don't...

08:48.361 --> 08:51.071
Your wife keeps her own secrets.

08:51.113 --> 08:52.572
Margie...

08:55.201 --> 08:59.371
I don't have a magic wand.
I don't intend to hang on.

08:59.413 --> 09:04.084
But make her talk to me.
It'll be the way that she wants.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.169
But this is not...

09:07.964 --> 09:09.214
...proper.

09:10.299 --> 09:12.884
- Please.

We're over, Mark.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.957
You have someone.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.126
Yes.

09:46.168 --> 09:48.378
- For a long time?
- Does it matter?

09:48.421 --> 09:51.006
Yes.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.011
Do you...

09:57.096 --> 09:58.763
...sleep with him?

09:58.806 --> 09:59.889
Yes.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.017
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

10:02.059 --> 10:03.852
More than with me?

10:03.894 --> 10:05.186
Yes.

10:05.229 --> 10:06.730
I see.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.027
How do you intend to live now?

10:12.069 --> 10:14.571
- We have to discuss it.
- Now.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.864
As you want.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.199
Half an hour at the Cafe Einstein.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.785
I'm too far for half an hour.

10:23.831 --> 10:26.082
Are you calling from there?

10:27.209 --> 10:28.418
Yes.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.211
Is he listening?

10:31.422 --> 10:32.547
No.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.508
But he is there.

10:35.551 --> 10:36.801
Yes.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.325
Would 800 a month for Bob be enough?

11:00.368 --> 11:01.451
I suppose.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.079
Will you move in with him or
keep the apartment?

11:04.121 --> 11:06.206
I'll keep it if you allow me to.

11:06.248 --> 11:08.625
I've decided not to see Bob.

11:11.879 --> 11:13.713
- At all?
- At all.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.841
How can you say that?

11:16.884 --> 11:19.260
He's going to be fucked up
enough as it is.

11:19.303 --> 11:22.514
I don't want to fuck him up even more
by playing Sunday Daddy.

11:22.556 --> 11:25.558
- What were you to him anyway?
- Precisely.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.143
But...

11:27.186 --> 11:30.021
He knows you. He's yours. He needs...

11:30.064 --> 11:32.273
A real father full time?

11:32.316 --> 11:36.528
Well, I thought I could be, coming home
from the war, so to speak.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.615
You say it's better with him than with me.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.909
I get bored of it.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.622
Tell me.

11:47.665 --> 11:51.251
I think what you want to do to Bob is...

11:51.293 --> 11:54.838
Inhuman? So what you're doing
must be human.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.590
- How long is it going to last?
- I don't know.

11:57.633 --> 11:59.384
One week? Two weeks?

11:59.427 --> 12:04.472
And how do you dispose of ideas
like honesty and loyalty?

12:06.809 --> 12:11.020
If I could only believe that it happened
cleanly at first sight.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.481
OK, if it makes things easier,

12:13.524 --> 12:16.735
I was in his bed the first night
I met him, if you have to know.

12:16.777 --> 12:20.113
What do you expect of me?
Look what you're doing.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.993
No-one is good or bad

12:25.035 --> 12:27.120
but if you want, I am the bad one

12:27.163 --> 12:31.916
and if I knew he existed in this world,
I would have never had Bob with you.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.418

Three weeks, sir.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.176
What happened? It's Daddy.

15:28.218 --> 15:31.638
Mummy said she would be right back
but she never came.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.849
Then Margie called and told me to be brave

15:34.892 --> 15:39.562
because she had broke her leg and
she had to have the cast put on.

15:43.734 --> 15:46.361
You've been alone for a long time?

15:49.823 --> 15:51.908
Look, I got a new boat.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.749
Did you get it from Mummy?

15:59.792 --> 16:02.835
No. From Uncle Heinrich.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.214
Long ago?

16:07.383 --> 16:08.716
Yes.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.176
Yesterday?

16:10.219 --> 16:13.513
No. Before you were coming back
from far away.

16:16.850 --> 16:18.851
OK, little piggy.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.437
Come on, let's get out of this mess.

17:05.398 --> 17:06.733
I'm not interested.

17:06.775 --> 17:09.944

I can't live without you

17:09.987 --> 17:12.320

whatever there is

17:12.364 --> 17:14.656
but it doesn't look like
it makes much sense.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.785
- You can't take Bob away from me.
- I'm not trying.

17:17.828 --> 17:22.874
You can continue to visit whenever
you want, but I'm taking over here.

- Yes?

I must...

17:36.013 --> 17:39.223
You must restore order.
You must leave him.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.809
You will call him.
You will say it is over.

you love him

21:35.752 --> 21:37.461
Shall I take you?

21:44.219 --> 21:45.428
Where's Mummy?

21:45.470 --> 21:47.221
She went to see Margie.

21:49.474 --> 21:50.683
Are you going too?

21:50.726 --> 21:52.310
I'm staying with you.

22:06.450 --> 22:10.661
Hello, I'm Bob's father. I'll be bringing
him to school from now on.

22:12.998 --> 22:17.376
I'm glad. You're the father who went
far away and met the polar bears.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.087
Hello.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.797
What is this? A joke?

22:21.840 --> 22:23.341
What are you talking about?

22:23.383 --> 22:25.176
- I mean your wig.
- What?

22:25.218 --> 22:28.346
I'm so sorry. It's impossible.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.681
Have you ever seen my wife?

22:30.724 --> 22:33.684
Naturally. Every day of the school year.

22:47.115 --> 22:48.491
You're Heinrich?

22:48.533 --> 22:49.909
Yes.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.039
I've come for Anna.

22:58.752 --> 22:59.877
Anna's not here.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.546
You want me to break down
the bloody door?

23:02.589 --> 23:04.715
You don't have to. It's open.

23:07.552 --> 23:11.889
We don't have to be brutal to each other
or even impolite.

23:11.932 --> 23:16.519
Our situation is like a mountain lake
we are trying to swim in,

23:16.561 --> 23:18.729
starting from different shores.

23:18.772 --> 23:21.107
I am not astonished you are here.

23:21.149 --> 23:24.193
I was thinking about you
just before you came

23:24.236 --> 23:28.072
so now that you're here,
let's be open to each other.

23:30.534 --> 23:33.119
You can hate me as much as you like.

23:33.161 --> 23:36.372
But it's you who wants
to know things from me.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.833
So please make it possible.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.920
I am suffering as much as you are.

23:42.963 --> 23:46.924
The fact that Anna did not inform you
was harmful to everyone

23:46.967 --> 23:49.051
but I always accept Anna's ways,

23:49.094 --> 23:52.805
as I think no-one has a right
to impose his will on anyone.

23:54.182 --> 23:56.559
So that's how you've changed her so much.

23:56.601 --> 24:00.020
Possibly, but is it changing her
or making her open to herself?

24:00.063 --> 24:03.607
So open she's inarticulate at night
and you have to speak for her?

24:03.650 --> 24:05.025
What are you talking about?

24:05.068 --> 24:07.736
We spoke on the phone last night,
you and I, didn't we?

24:07.779 --> 24:11.073
Stop it. I just arrived from Hamburg.
You weren't listening to me.

24:11.116 --> 24:14.368
I was just trying to make her comprehend
that I love her.

24:14.411 --> 24:17.830
I left the day you arrived to give her
the chance to decide for herself.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.248
I allowed you your chance.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.583
Bullshit!

24:20.625 --> 24:23.461
I'm not obliged to listen to you speak
in that way. It's offensive.

24:23.503 --> 24:25.671
How long have you been fucking me over?

24:25.714 --> 24:27.089
A year.

24:31.219 --> 24:32.970
All my visits home, all that time.

24:33.013 --> 24:34.096
Yes.

24:34.139 --> 24:37.308
And this is what you mean by
accepting Anna's ways?

24:37.350 --> 24:38.809
Precisely.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.858
The key being the infinitive.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.860
To accept.

24:55.452 --> 24:57.244
I have been honest with you.

24:57.287 --> 25:00.581
Would you permit me to enquire
on a specific point?

25:02.125 --> 25:06.003
On your last visit home,
were you content with your wife?

25:06.046 --> 25:07.838
I mean sexually.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.340
Why?

25:09.382 --> 25:14.261
Because in that period we reached
a state of perfect harmony.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.263
Er...

25:21.811 --> 25:23.521
My mother.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.152
- Is she here all the time?
- Yes.

25:30.195 --> 25:33.030
- Even when you're fucking Anna?
- Of course.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.205
Agh!

26:02.561 --> 26:08.232

26:54.195 --> 26:56.947

26:56.990 --> 27:00.743
One for...the master, one for the dame

27:00.785 --> 27:04.371
and one for the little boy
that lives down the lane.

27:04.414 --> 27:07.875
- Can I go out into the back yard?
- Yes, you may.

27:07.917 --> 27:09.752
But you take your sandwich with you.

27:15.925 --> 27:17.176
Where were you?

27:17.218 --> 27:19.511
I wrote you. I was at Margie's.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.597
That's not true. I spoke to her.

27:21.640 --> 27:22.723
I was with him.

27:22.766 --> 27:26.185
That's not true either. I saw him.
I may...stink from him.

27:26.227 --> 27:27.645
- But he's not lying.
- I was...

27:27.687 --> 27:29.438
- I was with friends.
- Who?

27:29.481 --> 27:31.106
- New friends.
- I'll check.

27:31.149 --> 27:33.734
Yes, check, check, check, check, check!

27:33.777 --> 27:35.486
Why did you leave last night?

27:35.528 --> 27:36.570
To be alone!

27:36.613 --> 27:38.781
But you said you went to friends.

27:38.823 --> 27:41.867
Why are you nagging me?
Can't you just leave me in peace?

27:41.910 --> 27:44.870
I could have perfect peace
if you never came back.

27:44.913 --> 27:48.957
It's Bob! I have Bob! He is my son too.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.293
Don't try to tell me you care about him
all that much.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.961
He didn't stop you from breaking us up.

27:53.004 --> 27:56.382
If you really thought about him, you'd
give a thought to us, for Christ's sake.

27:56.424 --> 27:58.050
I do! I do!

27:58.093 --> 28:00.719
No you don't. You think about buying him
a pair of shoes,

28:00.762 --> 28:03.764
about making him a snack,
about telling him a bedtime story

28:03.807 --> 28:06.558
but if you really thought about him,
you'd think about us.

28:06.601 --> 28:11.605
Right, right. Why are you always right?
But it's difficult, don't you understand?

28:11.648 --> 28:16.485
It's difficult. I didn't want it to happen
but it happened and now...

28:16.528 --> 28:18.320
Don't come any closer.

28:18.363 --> 28:19.822

28:19.864 --> 28:22.449

28:22.492 --> 28:25.577

with everybody on every corner.

44:18.364 --> 44:20.615
I gotten your wife's address.
It's in Kreuzberg.

44:20.658 --> 44:23.117
Sebastianstrasse 87, 1st floor.

44:24.620 --> 44:26.746
She seems to be alone.

44:26.789 --> 44:29.290
Do you want me to check this now?

44:29.333 --> 44:31.084
Danke.

45:38.694 --> 45:42.447
Sorry to bother you, miss.
I'm from the building manager's office.

45:42.489 --> 45:44.824
We had a complaint about
some broken windows somewhere

45:44.867 --> 45:46.701
and the glass falling
down on the sidewalk.

45:46.744 --> 45:49.912
- Is that what it is?
- I'm afraid I have to check your windows.

45:49.955 --> 45:52.415
- But I can assure you they're all right.
- How can you be so sure?

45:52.458 --> 45:55.126
I just... I just saw you come in.

45:56.462 --> 45:57.628
It'll only take a moment.

45:57.671 --> 45:59.088
But I don't want you to be here.

45:59.131 --> 46:02.049
I quite understand, miss,
but it's me or the police.

46:02.092 --> 46:04.594
A lady got hurt on the sidewalk,
a Turkish woman.

46:04.678 --> 46:08.973
You might say she shouldn't be here in the
first place but she lodged a complaint.

46:09.016 --> 46:11.601
So what can I do about it?

46:13.562 --> 46:14.771
Nothing.

46:16.690 --> 46:18.524
Please.

46:47.554 --> 46:48.971
Is it OK?

46:49.014 --> 46:50.723
Moment.

47:07.491 --> 47:08.699
So?

47:08.742 --> 47:10.493
Excuse me, the bathroom?

47:10.536 --> 47:13.496
The bathroom doesn't have a window.

47:13.539 --> 47:14.831
Are you sure?

47:14.873 --> 47:17.124
Absolutely.

47:17.167 --> 47:19.710
Some bathrooms have windows
this side of the house.

47:19.753 --> 47:21.379
Not in this one.

47:21.421 --> 47:24.590
I'm afraid I still have to check it
before someone else gets...

47:24.633 --> 47:26.551
Would you care for a glass of wine?

47:26.593 --> 47:28.010
- Wine?
- Yes.

47:28.053 --> 47:29.929
I'm afraid I...

47:31.265 --> 47:33.266
Yes, wine!

47:33.308 --> 47:37.520
- I'm afraid you...
- Oh, come on. Don't be so formal.

47:37.563 --> 47:41.232
Miss, it doesn't make any sense.
I've got k-k-kids.

47:41.275 --> 47:44.485
I only came for the windows.

47:45.904 --> 47:48.281
I'm sorry, miss, but...

47:48.323 --> 47:50.283
I still have to have a look.

47:57.291 --> 48:00.209
Oh! It broke!

- Much longer than I could.

49:05.317 --> 49:09.570
Hello, I'm sorry to bother you so late.
May I see your wife?

49:09.613 --> 49:11.948
No. She went out.

49:11.990 --> 49:14.116
BOB: Nee-na, nee-na, nee-na.

49:14.159 --> 49:16.494
That's not entirely true. She...

49:16.536 --> 49:18.829
She doesn't live with us any longer.

49:18.872 --> 49:19.956
Oh.

49:19.998 --> 49:21.332
It's about Bob.

49:21.375 --> 49:23.250
Ah! Bob!

49:23.293 --> 49:25.002
Bob is fine.

49:26.630 --> 49:30.132
He's just beaten the world record
in tub diving.

49:33.345 --> 49:36.180
Oh! (SHE LAUGHS)

- Come on. Cut it out, Bob.

49:45.899 --> 49:48.776
He's actually been in the bath
for about an hour.

49:48.819 --> 49:50.403
Yes, of course.

49:55.450 --> 49:57.660
I've called many times.

49:57.703 --> 50:02.957
I wanted to discuss with you
the redistribution of our parts

50:03.000 --> 50:07.628
in this fundamentally vulgar structure,
the triangle.

50:07.671 --> 50:10.089
In other words, where is she?

50:10.132 --> 50:13.718
I've been giving a great deal of thought
to the illogical aspects

50:13.760 --> 50:15.511
of your anger and your defence.

50:15.554 --> 50:17.013
Is Anna with you?

50:17.055 --> 50:18.723
And if?

50:18.765 --> 50:21.976
I would only ask to have a talk with her.

50:22.019 --> 50:24.311
What if I said no?

50:24.354 --> 50:27.148
I'm sorry I used violence with you.

50:27.190 --> 50:32.111
Now I'd only apply my psychic process
to make her come to me.

50:32.154 --> 50:34.488
Oh, I'm so sorry, she's not here.

50:34.531 --> 50:37.491
Did I tell you I had a wife
and a daughter?

50:37.534 --> 50:38.784
No!

50:38.827 --> 50:40.536
They live in Cincinnati.

50:40.579 --> 50:41.996
What does that do for you?

50:42.039 --> 50:44.498
They will always remain my first family.

50:44.541 --> 50:48.377
Anna could be the second
and you and Bob in some sense.

50:48.420 --> 50:50.296
Do you have a dog?

50:50.338 --> 50:51.964
Would that I had.

50:52.007 --> 50:53.758
You misuse me.

50:53.800 --> 50:58.137
It's stiff and blocked men like you that
lead us to the concentration camp.

50:58.180 --> 51:02.808
Who are the crusaders of every
blind principle, so-called ideology

51:02.851 --> 51:05.436
humanity invents to strangle me?

51:05.479 --> 51:07.188
Why don't you like me?

51:07.230 --> 51:10.107
Why don't you draw in
the plentitude of my love

51:10.150 --> 51:13.319
and pull it all over your life
like a veil?

51:13.361 --> 51:15.488
OK, I like you.

51:15.530 --> 51:19.575
And I can tell you where Anna lives.

51:21.870 --> 51:23.454
Lives?

51:23.497 --> 51:27.249
Only...I don't know the guy's name.

51:27.292 --> 51:30.044
It's impossible. It doesn't make sense.

51:30.087 --> 51:31.462
Why not?

51:31.505 --> 51:34.632
Because you think you've given her
the supreme pleasure?

You with your yin-yang balls
dangling from your zen brain.

51:40.889 --> 51:44.558
OK, maybe it does boil down to
a sexual contest, in which case...

51:44.601 --> 51:47.478
I'm sure you win hands down.

51:49.231 --> 51:51.482

- BOB: Nee-na, nee-na.

51:53.860 --> 51:55.861
(BOB CONTINUES)

51:55.904 --> 51:58.447
I used to be afraid of you.

51:59.825 --> 52:01.492
But I don't think I am any more.

52:01.535 --> 52:05.037
There's nothing to fear except God.

52:06.957 --> 52:08.541
Whatever that means to you.

52:12.212 --> 52:14.088
For me God is a disease.

52:26.101 --> 52:30.229
That's why through the disease
we can reach God.

"Tracking something," said Winnie-the-Pooh
very mysteriously.

52:33.692 --> 52:36.068
"Tracking what?" said Piglet,
coming closer.

52:36.111 --> 52:40.114
"That's just what I ask myself.
I ask myself, What?"

52:40.157 --> 52:41.907
"What do you think you'll answer?"

52:41.950 --> 52:44.034
He wants to say good night to you.

52:45.662 --> 52:47.121
Thank you.

52:51.501 --> 52:53.711
You smell clean.

52:53.753 --> 52:55.921
Do you like Helen?

52:57.924 --> 52:59.592
I think so.

52:59.634 --> 53:01.552
Are you not sure?

53:01.595 --> 53:03.554
Well, I don't know her yet.

53:03.597 --> 53:05.264
Do you like her?

53:05.307 --> 53:07.391
Yes, and who don't you like?

53:07.434 --> 53:10.728
Well, I don't like Heinrich

53:10.770 --> 53:13.856
and I don't like that sailboat.

53:13.899 --> 53:15.399
Why? He's funny.

53:16.443 --> 53:18.027
I don't like...

53:19.237 --> 53:21.947
I don't like Mummy to like him
more than us.

53:23.658 --> 53:26.076
Who's prettier? Mummy or Helen?

53:26.119 --> 53:28.287
Who do you think is prettier?

53:28.330 --> 53:29.788
You tell me.

53:29.831 --> 53:31.707
Our Mummy.

53:38.048 --> 53:39.715
Good night, son.

53:47.432 --> 53:49.225
Thank you.

53:51.228 --> 53:53.687
Do you have anyone to help you with him?

53:53.730 --> 53:57.566
Oh it's... It's not a problem. I...

53:57.609 --> 53:59.235
I have plenty of time.

53:59.277 --> 54:03.197
Bob won't say anything to me.
He keeps his words for himself.

54:03.240 --> 54:08.035
He knows everything, senses everything.
Children are amazing.

54:08.078 --> 54:09.620
Yeah.

54:09.663 --> 54:13.249
After lunch we have an hour's rest.

54:15.168 --> 54:17.378
Bob very often goes to sleep.

54:17.420 --> 54:20.798
When he does he cries or shouts.

54:20.840 --> 54:22.466
Does he do it at home?

54:22.509 --> 54:23.968
No.

54:25.095 --> 54:26.220
Oh.

54:26.263 --> 54:28.472
He screams.

54:28.515 --> 54:31.475
It is very difficult to calm him down.

54:31.518 --> 54:34.853
When he wakes up he pretends
that nothing happened.

54:34.896 --> 54:36.855
What can I say?

54:40.235 --> 54:42.861
I'm at war against women.

54:42.904 --> 54:45.447
They...have no foresight.

54:45.490 --> 54:49.493
There's nothing about them that is stable,
there's nothing to trust.

54:50.996 --> 54:52.871
They're dangerous.

54:52.914 --> 54:57.001
There is nothing in common among women
except menstruation.

54:57.043 --> 54:58.669
Excuse me.

54:58.712 --> 55:03.507
I come from a place where evil seems
easier to pinpoint

55:03.550 --> 55:06.260
because you can see it in the flesh.

55:06.303 --> 55:11.348
It becomes people so you know exactly
the danger of being deformed by it.

55:11.391 --> 55:14.935
Which doesn't mean I admire your world.

55:14.978 --> 55:19.732
But I find pathetic these stories of women
contaminating the universe.

55:21.359 --> 55:22.776
I'm...

55:22.819 --> 55:25.571
I'm one of the contaminated.

55:25.613 --> 55:27.990
Because you never feel free, do you?

55:28.033 --> 55:31.201
So sad that for you freedom
seems to mean evil.

55:32.579 --> 55:34.747
And what about lack of freedom?

55:36.875 --> 55:38.542
It's extraordinary.

55:48.136 --> 55:49.762
All right.

55:50.805 --> 55:54.308
Together we can listen if Bob cries out.

56:19.292 --> 56:21.919
You don't have to make love to me.

56:27.342 --> 56:29.593
I'm not trying.

56:33.765 --> 56:36.100
(BOB SCREAMING)

56:37.644 --> 56:40.062

56:40.105 --> 56:44.483
- Mummy! My Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!
- It's OK. It's all right.

56:44.526 --> 56:47.319
- It's OK. It's all right.
- Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!

56:47.362 --> 56:50.280
- It's all right. It's all right.
- Mummy! Mummy! Mummy!

(BOB WHIMPERS)

56:53.034 --> 56:56.703
(WHISPERS) It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.

56:56.746 --> 56:59.957
It's all right. Sh!

57:11.261 --> 57:12.886
I'm sorry.

57:12.929 --> 57:15.139
It wasn't very wise of me.

57:17.142 --> 57:20.310
This makes you think
you've been right all along.

57:23.022 --> 57:24.523
Hello, Bob.

57:24.566 --> 57:27.109
CHILDREN: I'm the big boss here.

57:28.528 --> 57:31.196
You're the little boss.

57:46.171 --> 57:50.757
Good morning. I phoned you at home
then I thought I might catch you here.

57:50.800 --> 57:54.553
I didn't tell you where
Bob goes to school.

57:54.596 --> 57:57.598
It wasn't difficult.
We have a minor problem here.

57:57.640 --> 57:58.682
Yes?

57:58.725 --> 58:02.311
The detective who was in charge of tracing
your wife didn't come home last night.

58:02.353 --> 58:03.395
So?

58:03.438 --> 58:06.398
He wasn't at home this morning and
he hasn't reported to the office.

58:06.441 --> 58:07.858
Before we start to get worried...

58:07.901 --> 58:11.069
When was he going to check it?
Yesterday or today?

58:11.112 --> 58:12.154
I don't know.

58:12.197 --> 58:13.739
Please don't misunderstand me.

58:13.781 --> 58:17.117
That detective could've gotten drunk
and spent the night with whores,

58:17.160 --> 58:20.454
although that's not much likely.
He could have died of a heart attack

58:20.497 --> 58:23.665
If our detective doesn't show up
by noon I'll have to notify the police.

58:23.708 --> 58:26.543
The police will start digging into your
problem. That's how it is.

58:26.586 --> 58:28.295
You and I can claim professional secrecy

58:28.338 --> 58:30.756
but you have to give me the address
the detective gave you.

58:30.798 --> 58:33.550
Sebastianstrasse 87, floor 1 .

58:33.593 --> 58:35.969
Have you been to that address yourself
or telephoned?

58:36.012 --> 58:37.513
- No.
- Very sensible of you.

58:37.555 --> 58:39.348
But may I ask why not?

58:39.390 --> 58:42.518
I had the impression that you were
tremendously interested

58:42.560 --> 58:43.727
in finding your wife.

58:44.771 --> 58:46.480
Yes, I was.

58:46.523 --> 58:48.982
I suppose I still am.

58:49.025 --> 58:53.028
But that was out of pure, blind ambition.

58:54.280 --> 58:55.948
And you know something?

58:57.200 --> 59:00.953
I don't feel like there's anything
much ambitious left in me.

59:04.457 --> 59:05.916
I see.

59:08.419 --> 59:12.631
So I don't even have to ask you
as a personal favour

59:12.674 --> 59:15.842
not to come to the office
until I contact you.

59:17.262 --> 59:18.387
Why?

59:19.430 --> 59:23.725
Precisely because of the...
delicacy of your feelings,

59:23.768 --> 59:26.603
you might be able to understand that...

59:26.646 --> 59:30.607
my interest in the case comes
from the fact that I...

59:30.650 --> 59:32.734
live with that detective.

59:36.489 --> 59:38.073
I'll be calling.

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:32.044
(SOUND OF SCRUBBING)

01:00:40.261 --> 01:00:41.970
I have to talk to you.

01:00:42.013 --> 01:00:43.972
That's what I guessed.

01:00:55.443 --> 01:00:57.611
Have you ever seen this man?

01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:59.488
Do I have to answer you?

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:02.658
Well, you have to answer
to someone eventually.

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.576
That's too easy.

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:08.497
But it's you...or the police, right?

01:48:54.611 --> 01:48:59.698
It would be good to think that the soul
lives separately from the body.

01:48:59.741 --> 01:49:04.203
That the soul lives for ever
and the body only for a time.

01:49:05.247 --> 01:49:07.248
But it isn't so.

01:49:09.334 --> 01:49:11.043
I don't know any more.

01:49:11.086 --> 01:49:12.545
I do.

01:49:18.009 --> 01:49:22.137
I have to be...on my son's side.

01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:24.640
Even if he has made you unhappy.

01:49:27.018 --> 01:49:30.062
I know all there is to know about him.

01:49:31.982 --> 01:49:33.732
That I love him.

01:49:35.026 --> 01:49:36.360
Yes.

01:49:36.403 --> 01:49:39.780
I was wondering which is worse.

01:49:40.907 --> 01:49:43.158
Take away someone's wife,

01:49:43.201 --> 01:49:45.494
hurt a child...

01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:48.998
...or to kill.

01:49:53.253 --> 01:49:56.839
He also had a wife and a child.

01:49:58.174 --> 01:50:00.009
I used to like her.

01:50:00.051 --> 01:50:02.636
I liked your Anna too.

01:50:03.930 --> 01:50:06.181
I had to like both of them...

01:50:07.559 --> 01:50:09.977
...since they loved him.

01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:12.855
The world is only what it is.

01:50:24.701 --> 01:50:26.785
Murderous.

01:50:26.828 --> 01:50:28.787
If we are the best of it.

01:50:30.665 --> 01:50:33.500
You don't have to worry about me.

01:50:36.796 --> 01:50:39.048
I don't want to be here...

01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:44.386
...if Heinrich is not around any more.

What about you, Mark?

01:51:54.666 --> 01:51:58.794
Our man won't confide or deal with
your successor, he wants you.

01:51:58.837 --> 01:52:01.755
In fact, Mark, there is no successor.

01:52:01.798 --> 01:52:04.174
We can take care of drowning dogs,

01:52:04.217 --> 01:52:06.927
but please help us take care of
the drowning world.

01:52:06.970 --> 01:52:10.264
Don't you think it's uneconomical
to waste yourself on dogs?

01:52:10.306 --> 01:52:12.725
Even dogs you love?

01:52:12.767 --> 01:52:15.686
I met a man who loved everything.

01:52:17.063 --> 01:52:19.356
And he died in a flood of shit.

01:52:19.399 --> 01:52:22.234
We know. That's just details.

01:52:22.277 --> 01:52:24.778
When I was a boy...

01:52:24.821 --> 01:52:27.614
I had a dog and his name was Louis.

01:52:27.657 --> 01:52:32.661
When he crawled under the porch to die,
I stayed there with him.

01:52:32.704 --> 01:52:33.871
So what?

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:42.254
I wanted to see what it was
that made him crawl under there.

01:52:42.297 --> 01:52:45.007
Nobody's a boy any more.

01:52:45.049 --> 01:52:47.050
Must we prove it?

01:53:06.613 --> 01:53:09.490
This is the address.

01:53:30.553 --> 01:53:34.389
Back up, then full speed,
and crash into the police car.

01:53:34.432 --> 01:53:36.683
My pleasure, sir.

01:53:58.706 --> 01:54:03.293
Out of the car!
