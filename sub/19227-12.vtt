WEBVTT

00:01.159 --> 00:02.262
For all those times

00:02.297 --> 00:04.053
Mom makes me go back
to the grocery store

00:04.078 --> 00:05.546
to get something she forgot,

00:05.571 --> 00:09.169
I present my latest invention...
the Grocer-Whee!

00:09.204 --> 00:11.938
As in yell "whee," not pee your pants.

00:11.974 --> 00:13.240
Though with the speed of this baby,

00:13.275 --> 00:14.941
you might do both.

00:14.977 --> 00:16.943
I just need someone to test it.

00:16.979 --> 00:18.211
Luckily, in a big family,

00:18.247 --> 00:20.247
there's always someone
available to help.

00:20.282 --> 00:22.315
- Busy.
- Busy.

00:22.351 --> 00:25.152
- Sure.
- Great. Let's go.

00:25.187 --> 00:27.120
You guys will be perfect for testing

00:27.156 --> 00:28.288
what it's like to ride with watermelons.

00:28.323 --> 00:30.357
Not so fast.

00:30.392 --> 00:33.293
We're sick of everyone
asking us littles for help,

00:33.328 --> 00:35.395
and not getting compensated.

00:35.430 --> 00:38.064
So we started a business.

00:38.100 --> 00:41.067
If you want A Little Help,

00:41.103 --> 00:43.003
you're gonna have to pay for it.

00:43.038 --> 00:45.972
- I'm not paying you.
- Then no.

00:46.008 --> 00:49.142
Good luck finding three other watermelon
impersonators on short notice.

00:49.178 --> 00:51.311
That's lunch, guys.

00:55.250 --> 00:57.184
Well, when your family turns out to be

00:57.219 --> 00:58.985
a giant disappointment,

00:59.021 --> 01:01.087
you can always turn to your best friend.

01:01.123 --> 01:03.156
Grocer-Whee?

01:03.192 --> 01:05.125
I don't know. It sounds fast.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.961
Yeah, that's the "whee" part, Ellie.

01:07.996 --> 01:11.264
How about you test, and I watch?

01:11.300 --> 01:14.000
From a safe distance.

01:15.237 --> 01:17.404
Ellie lives her whole life
from a safe distance.

01:17.439 --> 01:19.406
Her mom is so over-protective,

01:19.441 --> 01:21.341
Ellie's afraid of everything.

01:21.376 --> 01:24.010
Hopscotch?! Uneven sidewalks
are the quickest way

01:24.046 --> 01:26.046
to lose a tooth.

01:26.081 --> 01:28.215
A kite?! Toys on strings
are the quickest way

01:28.250 --> 01:29.950
to lose a tooth.

01:29.985 --> 01:32.085
A merry-go-round?
Not belting yourself in

01:32.120 --> 01:34.054
is the quickest way to lose a tooth.

01:34.089 --> 01:37.090
If that was true,
these would be long gone.

01:37.125 --> 01:39.259
Makes me wonder which came first...

01:39.294 --> 01:41.995
the chicken or
the chicken's chicken mom.

01:42.030 --> 01:44.331
Ellie.

01:44.366 --> 01:48.168
My job as your friend
is to be a good influence.

01:48.203 --> 01:52.172
I'm going to teach this chicken to fly.

01:52.207 --> 01:54.207
Remember that day at school
when you pretended to be me

01:54.243 --> 01:55.408
so we could fool the teacher?

01:55.444 --> 01:57.377
There was a super moon that week.

01:57.412 --> 02:00.013
I don't know if it affected
me like it does the tides.

02:00.048 --> 02:03.183
Next one's in 2034; we'll find out then.

02:03.218 --> 02:06.186
Being scared of everything
is no way to live.

02:06.221 --> 02:08.288
I bet there's a ton of things
you'd like to try.

02:08.323 --> 02:11.358
I would like to go horseback riding.

02:11.393 --> 02:14.327
But there's the horse, and the riding.

02:14.363 --> 02:17.030
Just thinking about it
makes my throat close up.

02:17.065 --> 02:18.298
- (clears throat)
- LEWIE: Throat closed, Ellie?

02:18.333 --> 02:20.000
Need a little help?

02:20.035 --> 02:22.102
Let me take a look.

02:22.137 --> 02:25.038
Okay, now you should be scared.

02:25.073 --> 02:26.339

02:30.212 --> 02:34.247

03:18.360 --> 03:20.226
- (beeping)
- Sticking my hand

03:20.262 --> 03:22.429
under the boys' bed is one step too far.

03:22.464 --> 03:25.231
That's the fear talking.

03:25.267 --> 03:27.267
And that's who we're crushing today. Go!

03:29.071 --> 03:32.138
Five, four, three,

03:32.174 --> 03:33.473
- two...
- Ewww.

03:33.508 --> 03:35.175
And you made it!

03:40.182 --> 03:41.347
- Huh?
- Hey, look.

03:41.383 --> 03:43.083
You found Beast's chicken finger.

03:47.222 --> 03:50.256
Serves me right for walking
past Lewie and Beast's room.

03:50.292 --> 03:53.493
Hey, how did your film club
meeting go the other night?

03:53.528 --> 03:55.428
Really well.

03:55.764 --> 03:57.530
We watched the new Batman, and we...

03:57.565 --> 03:59.565
Wait, why are you asking me
something about myself?

03:59.601 --> 04:01.601
Because I wanna go to the next meeting.

04:01.636 --> 04:02.702
Why?

04:09.811 --> 04:12.645
(ringtone plays)

04:12.680 --> 04:14.447
Hey, Rach, it's Mom.

04:14.482 --> 04:17.483
It went straight to voicemail,
so you must be very busy.

04:17.519 --> 04:19.317
I just wanted to let you know

04:19.353 --> 04:21.387
that you're an hour past curfew.

04:21.423 --> 04:23.456
And that's not the skirt
you left the house in.

04:23.491 --> 04:25.758
So you're grounded for two weeks.

04:25.794 --> 04:27.660
Love you. Bye.

04:27.695 --> 04:30.396
Grounded?! It's not my fault

04:30.432 --> 04:31.664
Conner's motorcycle ran out of gas.

04:31.699 --> 04:33.366
You were on a motorcycle?

04:33.401 --> 04:35.735
Hey, I'm home.

04:35.770 --> 04:37.336
I'm gonna go make myself a sandwich.

04:37.372 --> 04:39.338
He's late too.

04:39.374 --> 04:40.807
How come he's not
getting a punishment phone call?

04:40.842 --> 04:42.642
Because he was at the film club

04:42.677 --> 04:44.744
that he runs at the Bait And
Bite; that's a school event.

04:46.781 --> 04:49.515
I can't leave the house
unless it's for school,

04:49.551 --> 04:52.452
or a school event that
my date also shows up at.

04:52.487 --> 04:54.454
So I'm joining Film Club.

04:54.489 --> 04:57.423
You wanna use my club
as a cover to see some guy.

04:57.459 --> 04:59.525
Maybe. Does Dad hang out there?

04:59.561 --> 05:01.661
No, he just opens the store and leaves.

05:01.696 --> 05:04.497
Then yes.

05:04.532 --> 05:07.400
Awesome. I was looking
to be an accomplice

05:07.435 --> 05:09.302
for some nameless, faceless
dude I don't care about.

05:09.337 --> 05:12.405
Question: how many girls normally
show up to your movie nights?

05:12.440 --> 05:13.673
Does Howie's mom count?

05:13.708 --> 05:16.309
I bet my friends would be interested

05:16.344 --> 05:17.610
in learning about film.

05:17.645 --> 05:19.378
Especially that super cute one

05:19.414 --> 05:20.746
you can never get without my help.

05:20.782 --> 05:22.748
Be more specific. That's all of them.

05:22.784 --> 05:25.751
- Brittany Ross.
- Tonight, 7:00 p.m. See you at Film Club.

05:29.424 --> 05:32.658
It's a pillow fight.
Take off the mask and pads.

05:39.434 --> 05:41.434
That wasn't so bad.

05:41.469 --> 05:43.536
I've always wanted to scream
this without a mouth guard.

05:43.571 --> 05:46.572
Pillow fight!!

05:48.000 --> 05:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:55.617 --> 05:57.617
And there goes the last banana.

06:00.755 --> 06:02.522
Time for your final exam.

06:02.557 --> 06:03.656
Horseback riding.

06:03.691 --> 06:05.424
Love the spirit,

06:05.460 --> 06:06.759
but I've got a better idea.

06:06.794 --> 06:08.761
Let's put the cart before the horse.

06:14.402 --> 06:16.335
You hop in, and I'll drive.

06:16.371 --> 06:18.437
Or...

06:18.473 --> 06:20.439
I could drive.

06:28.416 --> 06:32.451
Wow. Our little Ellie's
come a long way in one day.

06:32.487 --> 06:35.388
Aww, this must be how a mama bird feels

06:35.423 --> 06:38.658
when her baby bird wants
to drive the Grocer-Whee.

06:42.730 --> 06:45.565
Okay, just keep it at
a reasonable speed and...

06:50.738 --> 06:52.572
(crashing sounds)

06:52.607 --> 06:55.575
I see you've had an accident.

06:55.610 --> 06:57.810
This week, we have
a special on cover-ups.

06:57.845 --> 06:59.712
You know what would be special?

06:59.747 --> 07:01.347
You going away.

07:01.382 --> 07:03.549
We can do that as well.

07:03.585 --> 07:05.551
Leaving. We'll send you the bill.

07:09.791 --> 07:13.492
My mom's mailbox is ruined.

07:13.528 --> 07:15.561
I'm gonna be in so much trouble.

07:15.597 --> 07:18.497
It's not great, but don't panic.

07:18.533 --> 07:20.733
I mean, how bad of a
punishment can she dish out?

07:20.768 --> 07:23.736
You're already not allowed
to have TV and junk food.

07:23.771 --> 07:26.305
You're right.

07:26.341 --> 07:28.574
What's the worst that could happen?

07:29.744 --> 07:32.345
She's sending me to boarding school.

07:33.648 --> 07:36.449
I wanted to get Ellie out of her shell,

07:36.484 --> 07:38.351
not out of my life.

07:38.386 --> 07:39.685
New name for my cart...

07:39.721 --> 07:41.721
the Grocer Whee Have A Problem.

07:46.210 --> 07:47.618
Okay.

07:47.643 --> 07:49.336
This is crazy.

07:49.371 --> 07:51.371
You do one thing
you're not supposed to do,

07:51.407 --> 07:53.507
and your mom's
sending you to boarding school?

07:53.542 --> 07:56.476
- Where?
- Some place called Radistone Academy.

07:56.505 --> 08:00.173
Mom says it's great.
It'll be good for me.

08:00.215 --> 08:03.350
She also thinks mung
beans are good for you.

08:03.385 --> 08:05.318
This is going to be bad.

08:09.391 --> 08:11.224
She's actually been talking
about sending me there

08:11.260 --> 08:12.492
for a while.

08:12.528 --> 08:14.361
But all of a sudden,
boom, she enrolled me.

08:14.396 --> 08:17.097
How's that going to solve anything?

08:17.132 --> 08:19.332
(gasps)

08:19.368 --> 08:22.102
It will get you away from me.

08:22.137 --> 08:25.338
You riding my invention must've
pushed her over the edge.

08:25.574 --> 08:27.641
She thinks I'm a bad influence.

08:27.676 --> 08:30.310
The semester starts in two weeks.

08:30.345 --> 08:32.379
What'll we do?

08:34.783 --> 08:38.485
We make the bad influence
go away so you don't have to.

08:39.755 --> 08:44.591
So... how may we Little Help you today?

08:44.626 --> 08:46.726
We need to stage a fake
fight between me and Ellie.

08:46.762 --> 08:49.429
We can do that.
What are we talking here?

08:49.464 --> 08:50.630
Pushing, pinching?

08:50.666 --> 08:52.565
We're gonna need advance notice

08:52.601 --> 08:54.434
if you want pie throwing.

08:54.469 --> 08:56.603
And I should warn you,
it is on a per-pie basis.

08:56.638 --> 08:58.705
This is just a verbal argument.

08:58.740 --> 09:01.274
We wanna make Ms. Peters
think we aren't friends.

09:01.309 --> 09:03.276
But then we won't be friends.

09:03.311 --> 09:05.345
I'm usually a big fan of your schemes,

09:05.380 --> 09:06.713
but I don't see how that's a win.

09:06.748 --> 09:08.682
Ellie, I explained this.

09:08.717 --> 09:11.317
I know, but my brain just locks up

09:11.353 --> 09:12.652
whenever you mention we're not friends.

09:12.688 --> 09:15.388
Only for a couple of weeks.

09:15.424 --> 09:17.590
Just long enough for you to miss
this opening to get into Radistone.

09:17.626 --> 09:20.427
So I've got you down for two pies.

09:20.462 --> 09:21.728
Are we also going with the pinching?

09:21.763 --> 09:24.497
No pies, no pinching.

09:24.533 --> 09:26.399
We are going to tell you what to say.

09:26.435 --> 09:28.501
And you're going to play along
to help sell it.

09:29.705 --> 09:31.404
Fake fight support.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.605
What's our going rate on that?

09:32.641 --> 09:34.674
- Thousand bucks.
- Or 60 meatballs.

09:34.710 --> 09:37.277
I'll let you use my trampoline shoes.

09:37.312 --> 09:38.278
ALL: Done!

09:41.349 --> 09:42.582
So that's nice,

09:42.617 --> 09:44.551
Rachel and Ethan
doing Film Club together.

09:44.586 --> 09:48.421
Yeah. Brother-sister school activity,

09:48.457 --> 09:49.522
Rachel branching out.

09:49.558 --> 09:51.357
It's great.

09:51.393 --> 09:52.525
It's weird, right?

09:52.561 --> 09:54.761
So weird. They're up to something.

09:54.796 --> 09:56.663
I'll check the security camera
feed from the store.

09:56.698 --> 09:59.365
<i>Final cup is being set. Here we go.</i>

09:59.401 --> 10:01.568
What's going on?

10:05.774 --> 10:08.508
Well, I'm not an expert,

10:08.543 --> 10:10.543
but shouldn't a film club have a film?

10:10.579 --> 10:12.479
They totally played us.

10:12.514 --> 10:14.380
I was all relaxed,

10:14.416 --> 10:16.549
and now I have to
go down there and punish them.

10:16.585 --> 10:20.320
- Or.
- Or? I like or.

10:20.355 --> 10:22.355
We could hold off and torture them.

10:22.390 --> 10:25.492
I will go for whichever one
doesn't require me

10:25.527 --> 10:26.793
to put on shoes.

10:28.530 --> 10:30.730
I was pleased you asked me over
to teach you about poetry.

10:30.766 --> 10:33.566
I mean, other than the kind that gets
your mouth washed out with soap.

10:33.602 --> 10:36.336
I love poetry. I couldn't
be more interested

10:36.371 --> 10:38.471
if I was getting paid.

10:38.507 --> 10:39.806
Here's one I wrote myself.

10:39.841 --> 10:41.674
It's called "Happiness."

10:41.710 --> 10:45.812
"A dark sky. A restless nap.

10:45.847 --> 10:49.349
A headless doll sits on my lap."

10:49.384 --> 10:51.751
I'm just going to, uh...

11:00.695 --> 11:02.629
All right, just like we practiced.

11:02.664 --> 11:04.597
Ready, set, fight.

11:04.633 --> 11:06.466
(woodenly) I am so mad at you.

11:08.703 --> 11:10.637
You call that fighting?

11:10.672 --> 11:12.472
Do it like you hear in our house.

11:13.675 --> 11:15.642
Who used the last of the ketchup?

11:15.677 --> 11:17.410
This hot dog is bone dry.

11:17.445 --> 11:19.412
Better. Now, stick to the script.

11:20.549 --> 11:22.749
I don't know why you made me
ride the Grocer-Whee.

11:22.784 --> 11:24.684
I didn't want to.

11:24.719 --> 11:26.786
Oh, it was fun. Loosen up.

11:26.822 --> 11:30.490
It was dangerous.
You're a bad influence, Harley.

11:30.525 --> 11:32.425
Ellie, what's going on?

11:32.460 --> 11:34.561
(gasps) Mom.

11:34.596 --> 11:36.529
Sorry you had to see me so angry.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.765
But she brings out the worst in me.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.601
You're no fun, and everybody knows it.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.708
And everybody knows it.

11:50.712 --> 11:53.646
Wow, Lewie, looks like Ellie and Harley

11:53.682 --> 11:56.549
- are in a big fight.
- Mm-hmm.

11:56.585 --> 12:00.520
Yeah. Next thing you know,
they're gonna be throwing pies.

12:00.555 --> 12:01.721
No, they won't.

12:01.756 --> 12:04.757
So what, you don't wanna
be friends anymore?

12:04.793 --> 12:06.359
What?

12:06.394 --> 12:07.727
Two friends in a fight.

12:07.762 --> 12:10.296
Who's wrong, who's right?

12:10.332 --> 12:12.632
Give her one more chance, Ellie.

12:12.667 --> 12:14.601
She's already had her chance.

12:14.636 --> 12:16.536
This friendship is over.

12:16.571 --> 12:17.737
(gasps)

12:17.772 --> 12:19.472
(gasps)

12:19.507 --> 12:20.773
(gasps)

12:22.510 --> 12:24.611
Fine. If that's how you feel,

12:24.646 --> 12:27.614
- then go.
- Mom, I'm sorry,

12:27.649 --> 12:30.350
but you're not allowed to hang
out with the Diazes anymore.

12:30.385 --> 12:31.551
We're out of here.

12:36.825 --> 12:39.592
It was a pleasure to serve you.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.494
If you want to hear more of my poems,

12:41.529 --> 12:43.496
my E-book is available for pre-order.

12:45.767 --> 12:47.800
Oh, good, you're home from work.

12:47.836 --> 12:50.403
- How was your day?
- It was... - Yeah, don't care.

12:50.438 --> 12:51.771
Rachel and Ethan are upstairs.
You ready to have some fun?

12:51.806 --> 12:53.740
Why are we even still talking?

12:53.775 --> 12:55.675
(knock on door)

12:55.710 --> 12:57.644
Hey, Rach.

12:57.679 --> 12:59.712
I meant to ask.

12:59.748 --> 13:01.514
How was Film Club last night?

13:01.549 --> 13:03.383
It was amazing.

13:03.418 --> 13:07.287
In a school-y, learning kind of way.

13:07.322 --> 13:09.389
Not just the enjoying
yourself kind of way.

13:09.424 --> 13:11.457
That's great to hear.

13:11.493 --> 13:13.393
So what did you guys watch?

13:13.428 --> 13:18.631
It was a French movie.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.434
Star-crossed lovers who met in Paris

13:21.469 --> 13:24.570
- during the war. So romantic.
- Oh!

13:24.606 --> 13:27.307
Alien invasion flick.

13:27.342 --> 13:30.510
Martians go undercover and open
a car wash in San Antonio.

13:30.545 --> 13:33.379
It was in crazy HD, Technicolor.

13:33.415 --> 13:37.383
Small black and white film
with subtitles.

13:37.419 --> 13:39.585
I may have even learned a little French.

13:39.621 --> 13:42.555
Oh, well, I want to encourage

13:42.590 --> 13:44.657
your love of cinema.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.492
You guys should do it again tonight.

13:46.528 --> 13:48.561
Great idea.

13:48.596 --> 13:50.330
I mean, for Rachel.

13:50.365 --> 13:52.432
She asked if she could
lead the next discussion.

13:52.467 --> 13:54.334
We should probably jump on that

13:54.369 --> 13:55.468
before she loses her courage.

13:55.503 --> 13:57.737
Oh, you're a thoughtful brother.

13:57.772 --> 13:59.806
I do what I can.

13:59.841 --> 14:03.376
We're gonna be studying
a longer movie this time,

14:03.411 --> 14:05.578
so we're gonna be home way later.

14:05.613 --> 14:07.613
The longer the movie,
the more of a chance to learn.

14:07.649 --> 14:10.383
Great. Because that's
what this should be.

14:10.418 --> 14:12.452
A learning experience.

14:20.762 --> 14:22.328
We are good.

14:30.372 --> 14:33.406
- We are good.
- (doorbell rings)

14:36.644 --> 14:39.512
Hey, Ms. Peters.
What are you doing here?

14:39.547 --> 14:41.481
I came to talk to you.

14:41.516 --> 14:43.449
If it's about
the fight I had with Ellie,

14:43.485 --> 14:45.485
I'm sorry, but I was pretty mad.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.520
You can drop the act, Harley.

14:47.555 --> 14:49.422
What act?

14:49.457 --> 14:50.757
Oh, come on.

14:50.792 --> 14:53.426
I didn't believe you
or that terrible performance

14:53.461 --> 14:55.528
by your little troupe
of crossing guards.

14:55.563 --> 14:57.764
I know you and Ellie faked that fight.

14:57.799 --> 14:59.799
She knows?!

14:59.834 --> 15:02.668
Maybe if I close my eyes,
she'll go away.

15:06.775 --> 15:10.710
Nope. I could really use
a little help right now.

15:14.463 --> 15:16.129
I'm sorry. Fake?

15:16.165 --> 15:17.231
Fight?

15:17.266 --> 15:20.467
That would be crazy. Insane.

15:20.502 --> 15:24.104
Which I now fully realize. Glad we
got that cleared up. Okay, bye.

15:24.139 --> 15:26.206
Nice try.

15:26.242 --> 15:27.441
Spill it.

15:29.211 --> 15:32.446
We did it so Ellie wouldn't
have to go to boarding school.

15:32.481 --> 15:35.182
We knew you were sending her
there to get her away from me.

15:35.217 --> 15:38.552
Believe it or not,
this is not about you.

15:38.587 --> 15:41.121
The world doesn't revolve
around the Diazes.

15:41.156 --> 15:43.390
Although your family comprises a
large percentage of the population.

15:43.425 --> 15:46.260
Well, then, why were you
sending her to Radistone?

15:46.295 --> 15:48.428
Well, a last-minute slot just opened up,

15:48.464 --> 15:50.430
so I jumped at the opportunity.

15:50.466 --> 15:53.200
Then I witnessed what I can only
describe as a crime against the theater.

15:53.235 --> 15:57.170
The real crime is that cost me a
sweet pair of trampoline shoes.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.440
Well, you win.
I cancelled Ellie's enrollment.

16:00.476 --> 16:03.343
Why? You knew it was a fake fight.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.113
I realized if Ellie went that far

16:06.148 --> 16:07.481
to get out of going to Radistone,

16:07.516 --> 16:10.250
that she must really not want
to go, so she's staying.

16:10.286 --> 16:13.120
Yes! Ellie's staying!

16:13.155 --> 16:15.422
Mrs. Peters, you are the best!

16:15.457 --> 16:17.557
Wow. A lot of firsts this week.

16:20.596 --> 16:23.397
I know you think I'm a villain,

16:23.432 --> 16:25.565
but I would never send my daughter

16:25.601 --> 16:27.434
someplace she wouldn't love.

16:27.469 --> 16:29.569
I want the best, and sometimes,

16:29.605 --> 16:31.571
that requires a little push.

16:38.514 --> 16:40.514
Best for her.

16:40.549 --> 16:42.449
Like her mom would even know.

16:44.553 --> 16:46.486
MAN: <i> Radistone Academy,</i>

16:46.522 --> 16:49.289
<i>where your children
can live their dreams.</i>

16:49.325 --> 16:53.126
<i>This school's historic grounds
cover 700 acres</i>

16:53.162 --> 16:56.463
<i>of lush farmland that serve
as an idyllic setting</i>

16:56.498 --> 16:58.565
<i>for an unparalleled
educational transformation.</i>

16:58.600 --> 17:01.268
Wow, wherever that is,

17:01.303 --> 17:03.303
you know we can't afford
to go there on vacation.

17:03.339 --> 17:05.271
It's a school.

17:05.307 --> 17:06.440
Ellie was going to go there.

17:06.474 --> 17:08.474
But now she's not.

17:08.510 --> 17:12.244
Why not? Look at those activities.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.247
They've got Ellie written all over them.

17:18.252 --> 17:19.519
You're right.

17:19.555 --> 17:23.089
My job as your friend
is to be a good influence.

17:23.125 --> 17:26.292
She would love this place.

17:26.328 --> 17:28.228
She should go.

17:28.262 --> 17:31.565
Won't that be hard for
you if Ellie went away?

17:33.535 --> 17:35.502
Yeah.

17:35.537 --> 17:37.571
Very.

17:43.545 --> 17:46.246
Conner and Angela
are waiting for us at the mall.

17:46.281 --> 17:48.315
Once Mom and Dad leave,
we'll meet them there.

17:48.350 --> 17:50.517
Film Club's a lot easier to plan

17:50.552 --> 17:52.552
when you don't have a
movie, or a screen,

17:52.588 --> 17:54.521
or an audience.

17:54.556 --> 17:56.556
Okay, condiments
cleared, register's locked.

17:56.592 --> 17:58.458
Have fun watching the movie.

17:58.494 --> 18:01.128
Dad, we're not just watching movies.

18:01.163 --> 18:04.164
- We're experiencing film.
- You know what?

18:04.199 --> 18:06.166
You're making it sound so good,

18:06.201 --> 18:10.070
- we'd like to experience it with you.
- BOTH: What?!

18:10.105 --> 18:12.172
Yeah, it's not every day
we get to bond with our kids

18:12.207 --> 18:14.307
over something they're
so passionate about.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.176
We'll go grab a quick bite,

18:16.211 --> 18:17.544
and be back in a half hour.

18:23.385 --> 18:27.254
We've got 29 minutes to put
together a fake film club.

18:27.289 --> 18:29.256
That'd make a great idea for a movie.

18:29.291 --> 18:31.324
Yeah, a horror movie. Go, go, go.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.494
ELLIE: Harley.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.163
Ellie?

18:36.198 --> 18:37.531
Harley.

18:37.566 --> 18:39.533
Harley!

18:41.136 --> 18:44.237
Get out of there. What are you doing?

18:44.273 --> 18:46.440
You told me to meet you here.

18:46.475 --> 18:48.208
You know we're not
supposed to be talking.

18:48.243 --> 18:50.577
About that.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.417
I looked up Radistone Academy.

18:57.453 --> 18:59.319
It's amazing.

18:59.354 --> 19:01.088
That's why your mom
wants you to go there.

19:01.123 --> 19:03.056
Wait, you're on her team now?

19:03.092 --> 19:04.357
I'm on your team.

19:06.128 --> 19:07.494
This is hard for me to say,

19:07.529 --> 19:10.263
but I think your mom and I both are.

19:10.299 --> 19:13.400
We had a plan, Harley. This was not it.

19:13.435 --> 19:15.268
But the plan was wrong.

19:15.304 --> 19:17.437
I don't have another
fake fight on the schedule.

19:17.473 --> 19:19.272
We don't have anything on the schedule.

19:19.308 --> 19:20.507
Let's get in there and make some coin.

19:23.212 --> 19:24.311
I don't understand.

19:24.346 --> 19:26.279
You want me to go away?

19:26.315 --> 19:29.182
Wow. This sounds bad.

19:29.218 --> 19:31.284
(gasps)

19:31.320 --> 19:34.187
Too soon.

19:34.223 --> 19:37.224
Could this be the end
of Ellie and Harley?

19:37.259 --> 19:38.358
Guys.

19:38.393 --> 19:40.193
Two friends in a fight.

19:40.229 --> 19:42.429
Who's wrong, who's right?

19:42.464 --> 19:45.198
Of course I don't want you moving away.

19:45.234 --> 19:47.467
But this is what
Project Fearless was all about.

19:47.503 --> 19:50.370
Pushing you outside of
your comfort zone.

19:50.405 --> 19:53.106
Okay, they are way off script.

19:53.142 --> 19:55.408
I'm lost. Is anyone else lost?

19:55.444 --> 19:57.444
- Let's take five and regroup.
- Definitely.

19:57.479 --> 19:59.346
You could at least look the place up.

19:59.381 --> 20:01.114
I did.

20:01.150 --> 20:02.482
It's got archery, horseback riding,

20:02.518 --> 20:05.485
and all kinds of stuff
I've always wanted to do.

20:05.521 --> 20:08.221
But leaving home?

20:08.257 --> 20:09.422
And my best friend?

20:10.592 --> 20:13.460
That's even scarier than putting my hand

20:13.495 --> 20:16.196
under Lewie and Beast's bed.

20:16.231 --> 20:18.198
I know.

20:18.233 --> 20:21.334
But if you don't go, I'll be
the one holding you back.

20:21.370 --> 20:24.171
Then your mom will be right.

20:24.206 --> 20:28.441
I can't be your best friend
and your worst influence.

20:30.412 --> 20:32.312
I guess I could give it a try.

20:34.383 --> 20:36.516
I'm going to miss you, Harley.

20:36.552 --> 20:38.618
I'm going to miss you, too.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.526
Thanks for giving me a push.

20:48.397 --> 20:50.630
You promise to come visit?

20:50.666 --> 20:52.599
Are you kidding?

20:52.634 --> 20:55.235
If that school is
anything like the website,

20:55.270 --> 20:56.503
you won't be able to get rid of me.

20:59.408 --> 21:01.141
That one's on the house.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.276
Please, review us online.

21:06.148 --> 21:08.481
This is my film club? Really?

21:08.517 --> 21:11.318
They were all I could find on the
pier this late, so get moving.

21:16.391 --> 21:20.260
Hello. Welcome to
another night of Film Club.

21:20.295 --> 21:23.129
This crowd looks a little old
to go to your school.

21:23.165 --> 21:25.432
They're finishing their degrees.
Don't judge, Mom.

21:27.336 --> 21:28.535
For tonight's movie,
we're gonna be watching

21:28.570 --> 21:32.205
a DVD entitled <i>Boat Maintenance And You.</i>

21:32.241 --> 21:34.174
Funny. I have that in the store.

21:34.209 --> 21:37.210
Oh, you've already seen it?
You should probably go.

21:39.214 --> 21:41.314
I hope you enjoy
this 12-minute cinema classic.

21:41.350 --> 21:43.516
I thought there was an introduction.

21:43.552 --> 21:46.519
Of course. Rachel.

21:56.331 --> 21:57.364
Movies.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.499
Film.

22:00.502 --> 22:03.270
Cinema.

22:03.305 --> 22:06.273
Movies.

22:06.308 --> 22:08.408
- Film.
- You guys ready to call this?

22:08.443 --> 22:11.211
- Yeah, I'm done.
- Just ground us.

22:17.486 --> 22:20.353
Ellie, I am so proud of you.

22:20.389 --> 22:22.289
You're going off to Radistone,

22:22.324 --> 22:24.291
and you're going to do great.

22:24.326 --> 22:26.426
Because if there's
one thing we've learned,

22:26.461 --> 22:28.528
there's nothing you can't do.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.134
- To Ellie.
- ALL: To Ellie!

22:35.437 --> 22:37.437
Whoo!

22:37.472 --> 22:40.440
<i>Sometimes the bad influence
is exactly like it sounds.</i>

22:40.475 --> 22:42.342
<i>Bad.</i>

22:44.346 --> 22:46.413
I'm sorry I got us grounded.

22:46.448 --> 22:49.149
Hey, I got to hang with Brittany.

22:49.184 --> 22:52.152
Plus, I've got an in on fresh
halibut whenever I want.

22:52.187 --> 22:54.254
<i>And sometimes a bad influence</i>

22:54.289 --> 22:55.455
<i>is exactly what you need.</i>

22:58.393 --> 23:00.427
Okay, one last time
before you head off to school.

23:01.463 --> 23:04.331
Ellie!

23:04.366 --> 23:07.334
Have fun.

23:11.573 --> 23:13.473
I will. Right?

23:15.477 --> 23:17.143
I know you will.
