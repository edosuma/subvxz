07:50.403 --> 07:52.305
How did you know?

07:52.371 --> 07:55.141
{\an1}Being white helps an animal
blend in with the snow,

07:55.208 --> 07:56.642
which keeps them safe,

07:56.709 --> 07:59.912
because it makes them
hard to find. See?

a beluga whale,

08:21.000 --> 08:22.435

My favorite Arctic animal

08:45.358 --> 08:47.260

08:56.669 --> 08:58.337

09:14.553 --> 09:15.655

What did you get,
Nonny?

10:02.034 --> 10:04.270
I got...
Chicken soup with...

10:05.504 --> 10:07.039
Ice?

10:07.106 --> 10:08.007
(Laughing)

10:08.074 --> 10:09.275
Goby, Oona:
Brrrrr...

10:11.177 --> 10:15.114
{\an5}Little Fish:
Chicken soup with ice?
That's silly!

10:16.682 --> 10:19.051
There are a lot of people
who live in the Arctic

10:19.118 --> 10:22.455
and some of them get around
on the ice and snow

10:22.521 --> 10:24.290
on a sled pulled by dogs!

10:24.357 --> 10:25.424
<i>Go!</i>

10:26.092 --> 10:28.694
I said go, Bubble Puppy!

10:28.761 --> 10:30.129
Come on, giddy-up!

10:32.398 --> 10:34.133
Please, boy?

10:35.901 --> 10:37.837
What are you doing, Gil?

10:37.903 --> 10:40.873
I'm trying to get Bubble Puppy
to pull this dog sled,

10:40.940 --> 10:42.575
but he won't go!

10:42.641 --> 10:45.878
Well, people used to get sled
dogs to go by saying "mush."

10:45.945 --> 10:48.381
Bubble Puppy:
(Whimper) Arf arf!

10:48.447 --> 10:49.949
Hey, come back here!
Bubble Puppy!

10:51.417 --> 10:53.219
Come on!

10:57.023 --> 10:59.558
{\an5}Mr. Grouper:
Okay, who can tell me
what this is?

10:59.625 --> 11:02.194
Goby:
That's the world!

11:02.261 --> 11:03.362
Mr. Grouper:
That's right, Goby.

11:03.429 --> 11:05.531
This is called a globe.

11:05.598 --> 11:08.434
It shows what the whole world
looks like.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.369
Goby:
But where's the Arctic?

11:10.436 --> 11:12.938
The Arctic is up here
at the top.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.840
Why is it all white?

11:14.907 --> 11:17.576
{\an5}Mr. Grouper:
It's white because
it's all covered with snow.

11:17.643 --> 11:20.846
And at the very top of the
Arctic is the North Pole.

11:20.913 --> 11:23.082
There's a pole
up there?

11:23.149 --> 11:26.619
There's not actually
a real pole there.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.020
The North Pole is just
what we call

11:28.087 --> 11:30.089
the very tippy top
of the world.

11:30.156 --> 11:31.724
I want to go to the North Pole!

11:31.791 --> 11:34.593
Oona:
Yeah, me too!

11:34.660 --> 11:36.028
Mr. Grouper:
Well, you better bundle up

11:36.095 --> 11:39.899
because it gets really,
really cold up there.

11:39.965 --> 11:40.666
Guppies:
Brrrrr...

11:40.733 --> 11:42.468
(All giggle)

11:42.535 --> 11:45.071
Mr. Grouper:
Okay! Line up, everybody!

12:17.336 --> 12:19.805
<i>...there were two Arctic</i>

12:19.872 --> 12:21.607
{\an5}<i>Mr. Grouper: (Over radio)</i>
<i>Arctic rangers,</i>
<i>Arctic rangers.</i>

12:21.674 --> 12:24.276
<i>Please respond.</i>

12:24.343 --> 12:27.246
{\an1}Arctic rangers here!
Go ahead.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.582
<i>Mr. Grouper:</i>
<i>A narwhal needs your help.</i>

12:29.648 --> 12:30.950
What's a narwhal?

12:33.886 --> 12:37.490
{\an5}Nonny:
A narwhal is a kind of whale
that lives in the Arctic.

12:37.556 --> 12:39.825
<i>Look at that crazy horn!</i>

12:39.892 --> 12:42.495
The horn is actually
a really long,

12:42.561 --> 12:44.463
twisty tooth,
called a tusk.

12:44.530 --> 12:47.533
{\an5}<i>Mr. Grouper:</i>
<i>The narwhal is trapped</i>
<i>in Orca Bay.</i>

12:47.600 --> 12:49.335
<i>He can't find his way out.</i>

12:49.401 --> 12:50.636
<i>You must get to Orca Bay</i>
<i>at once.</i>

12:50.703 --> 12:53.172
We're on our way!

12:53.239 --> 12:55.574
<i>Mr. Grouper:</i>
<i>One more thing, rangers.</i>

12:55.641 --> 12:57.009
<i>Watch out for orcas!</i>

12:57.076 --> 13:01.180
<i>Yikes! That's a lot of teeth.</i>

13:01.247 --> 13:04.717
{\an1}We better rescue that narwhal
as fast as we can!

13:04.783 --> 13:07.686
{\an5}<i>Goby:</i>
<i>And so, the Arctic rangers</i>
<i>set out for or bay</i>

13:07.753 --> 13:08.954
<i>to find the narwhal.</i>

13:11.390 --> 13:14.460
The poor narwhal is lost
in there somewhere!

13:18.797 --> 13:20.332
<i>There he is!</i>

13:20.399 --> 13:22.001
(In unison)
The narwhal!

13:22.067 --> 13:23.135
The unicorn of the sea...

13:25.204 --> 13:26.172
<i>(Laughing)</i>

13:26.238 --> 13:27.573
We've got to help him,

13:27.640 --> 13:31.877
but how are we ever
going to get over there?

13:31.944 --> 13:34.914
I know! Maybe we can ride
on an iceberg.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.081
That's a good idea!

13:38.250 --> 13:40.786
Molly,
Whoa! Whoa! Oof!

13:42.087 --> 13:44.623
Hmm. Icebergs are too tall
and pointy

13:44.690 --> 13:46.859
for us to ride on.

13:46.926 --> 13:50.462
We've got to figure out
something else.

13:50.529 --> 13:53.566
Hey, we could ride
on an ice floe!

13:53.632 --> 13:55.234
Uh, what's the difference

13:55.301 --> 13:57.002
between an iceberg
and an ice floe?

13:59.138 --> 14:02.141
Icebergs are tall
and pointy.

14:02.208 --> 14:04.643
That's a lot of ice!

14:04.710 --> 14:07.046
{\an5}Nonny:
There's always more iceberg
under the water

14:07.112 --> 14:08.581
than there is above it.

14:08.647 --> 14:11.150
Reallllly.

14:11.217 --> 14:12.251
Yep!

14:12.318 --> 14:14.486
But ice floes are flat,

14:14.553 --> 14:16.021
so we can get on them!

14:17.289 --> 14:18.457
We need your help!

14:18.524 --> 14:21.694
Which one of these
is an ice floe?

14:24.463 --> 14:26.932
Little Fish:
That one! Right there!

14:26.999 --> 14:29.068
Right! The flat one!

14:31.170 --> 14:33.772
{\an5}<i>Goby:</i>
<i>So, the Arctic rangers</i>
<i>floated into Orca Bay</i>

14:33.839 --> 14:36.809
<i>on an ice floe, until...</i>

14:38.177 --> 14:40.446
Uh-oh.
Looks like we're stuck!

14:40.512 --> 14:42.381
Now what do we do?

14:42.448 --> 14:43.449
(High-pitched call)

14:43.515 --> 14:44.883
Molly,
Orca!

14:44.950 --> 14:47.186
Let's get out of here!

14:49.555 --> 14:51.023
That was a close one.

14:51.090 --> 14:54.426
Molly, look!
The narwhal!

14:55.261 --> 14:57.463
Hello, narwhal.

14:57.529 --> 14:59.431
We're here to rescue you!

14:59.498 --> 15:01.834
Narwhal:
(Happy narwhal sounds)

15:01.900 --> 15:03.769
We can show you the way
out of here!

15:03.836 --> 15:05.804
Narwhal:
(Narwhal squeal, splash)

15:05.871 --> 15:07.773
What's he doing?

15:09.708 --> 15:11.143
He's pushing us!

15:13.045 --> 15:15.114
We're almost out of Orca Bay!

15:16.382 --> 15:18.117

{\an1}Hey,
where'd the narwhal go?

15:34.199 --> 15:36.168
Narwhal:
(Narwhal sound)

15:36.235 --> 15:37.536
(Iceberg creaks)

15:37.603 --> 15:39.471
Look! He's blocking
the entrance to Orca Bay

15:39.538 --> 15:40.706
with an iceberg!

15:42.341 --> 15:43.475
He did it!

15:43.542 --> 15:46.845
But what if the orca swims
under it?

15:46.912 --> 15:48.714
I don't think she can.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.816
{\an1}There's a lot more iceberg
under the water

15:50.883 --> 15:53.385
than there is above it,
remember?

15:53.452 --> 15:54.753
Well, that's a relief.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.657
Booooo hoo hoo hoooo!
Ugh-ho!

16:00.392 --> 16:02.428
Aw, what's the matter?

16:03.629 --> 16:06.665
{\an1}Oh, I didn't mean
to scare you.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.500
{\an1}I just wanted
to see a narwhal.

16:11.103 --> 16:14.006
They are pretty cool.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.108
Oh, please let me out.

16:16.175 --> 16:18.577
I just want to be friends.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.179
Well...

16:20.245 --> 16:23.148
Do you promise
not to eat us?

16:23.215 --> 16:24.283
I promise.

16:25.584 --> 16:29.321
Well, then I guess
everything's okay!

16:29.388 --> 16:33.058
{\an5}Goby:
And so, the orca promised
not to eat them...

16:33.125 --> 16:36.095
And they all lived
happily ever after!
