WEBVTT

00:02.772 --> 00:07.239
Oh, hi, alex. I'm sure you'll be happy to
hear that you and dean broke the school
record

00:07.274 --> 00:09.815
By dating two months,
four days and three periods.

00:09.850 --> 00:13.568
Yep. I know. I saw your banner
in the cafeteria. Thank you.

00:13.603 --> 00:15.432
Oh. You saw that?

00:15.467 --> 00:18.923
Then I guess I wore this "check out
my banner" shirt for no reason.

00:20.156 --> 00:22.356
Hey, you should have
told them where.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.457
"in the cafeteria." ok.

00:25.492 --> 00:28.057
Wow, harper. Sometimes I
feel like you put more effort

00:28.092 --> 00:30.125
Into my relationship
with dean than he does.

00:30.159 --> 00:32.058
I'm sorry. Are you creeped out?

00:32.094 --> 00:34.262
No. You haven't creeped
me out for weeks.

00:35.498 --> 00:36.666
Oh, wait, here he comes.

00:37.836 --> 00:39.937
Hey, russo, I got a
gift for my girlfriend.

00:39.972 --> 00:43.004
Oh, let me guess. Something
you made in woodshop again?

00:44.339 --> 00:46.339
- I love how you know me.
- Oh.

00:47.741 --> 00:49.775
Oh, look. It's a birdhouse.

00:49.809 --> 00:52.243
Or a mailbox.
Wait, which one is it?

00:52.277 --> 00:53.711
Both.

00:55.279 --> 00:56.879
Oh, dean.

00:56.914 --> 00:59.315
These aren't really gifts.
They're assignments.

00:59.349 --> 01:01.450
Just like all the other ones were.

01:01.485 --> 01:05.453
It's just... It'd be nice if you
gave me something more special.

01:05.488 --> 01:08.990
Well, this is my first b-minus.

01:09.024 --> 01:11.892
- It's pretty special to me.
- Wait a minute.

01:13.594 --> 01:15.797
Is that a d turned into a b?

01:18.167 --> 01:19.300
Busted.

01:21.903 --> 01:24.305
* well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

01:24.340 --> 01:26.442
* that the end will no
doubt justify the means *

01:26.776 --> 01:28.376
* you can fix any problem
at the slightest ease *

01:28.410 --> 01:30.110
* yes, please *

01:30.144 --> 01:32.012
* well, you might find out
it'll go to your head *

01:32.680 --> 01:34.081
* when you write a report
on a book you never read *

01:34.582 --> 01:36.550
* with a snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

01:36.584 --> 01:38.286
* that's what I said *

01:38.320 --> 01:41.252
* everything is not what it seems *

01:41.286 --> 01:45.016
* when you can get all you
wanted in your wildest dreams *

01:45.050 --> 01:48.852
* you might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

01:48.886 --> 01:53.086
* because everything
is not what it seems *

01:53.121 --> 01:56.555
* everything is not what it seems *

01:56.590 --> 02:00.458
* when you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

02:00.493 --> 02:04.194
* be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

02:04.229 --> 02:07.163
* because everything is not *

02:08.465 --> 02:09.132
* what it seems *

02:12.935 --> 02:17.171
Ok, today's lesson will
be on shape shifting.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.772
Mom, what are you doing here?

02:20.708 --> 02:24.509
Demonstrating shape shifting.
Thank you, justin.

02:26.680 --> 02:30.382
Yeah, could we have a lesson on how to get
your boyfriend to treat you more special?

02:30.416 --> 02:33.484
Do I need to shape shift
back into your mom

02:33.518 --> 02:35.753
And give you one of her
eye rolls and hip twists?

02:35.787 --> 02:37.854
No, wait. I can do it.

02:40.724 --> 02:43.693
- Work it, sister.
- Ooh.

02:43.727 --> 02:47.297
Professor crumbs, to what do
we owe this... This honor?

02:47.331 --> 02:49.665
I need to ask a favor
of your father.

02:49.766 --> 02:53.701
Unfortunately, wiztech has been
completely infested with these.

02:53.735 --> 02:55.169
Ooh!

02:56.772 --> 02:59.506
A school full of wizards
can't deal with those?

02:59.540 --> 03:02.741
Alex, if you had
studied your wizardry,

03:02.775 --> 03:07.011
You would know plastic is impervious
to even the most powerful magic of all.

03:07.045 --> 03:10.180
Because of the plastic
ball infestation,

03:10.214 --> 03:13.015
We can't occupy the
castle or teach magic.

03:13.050 --> 03:17.820
But removing plastic balls is a pricey
proposition wiztech cannot afford.

03:17.854 --> 03:22.824
Well, why don't you sell some of those fancy
words like "proposition" and "afford"?

03:25.026 --> 03:27.727
We need to figure out a way
to get wizworld industry's

03:27.762 --> 03:30.096
Plastic ball removal
specialists to help us.

03:30.130 --> 03:32.097
Plastic ball removal specialists?

03:32.132 --> 03:36.168
- yes.
- Sounds dangerous.

03:36.202 --> 03:41.072
In the meantime, jerry, I was hoping you
could house a few of the wiztech students,

03:41.106 --> 03:45.908
Just for the time being. - I don't see
any problem with housing a few students.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:55.818 --> 03:58.252
Hey, that's not a few.

03:58.286 --> 04:00.654
No taksies backsies.

04:00.688 --> 04:04.590
Wow. I barely fit
through that door.

04:04.624 --> 04:09.660
Hugh, how many times do I have to tell you,
you're not a giant. All right? I'm bigger
than you.

04:09.695 --> 04:13.130
Well, my overnight
bags beg to differ.

04:15.966 --> 04:17.899
- Hey, hugh.
- Oh, hi, alex.

04:17.935 --> 04:20.135
This is my friend, ronald.

04:22.839 --> 04:24.739
Hello. Alex,

04:24.774 --> 04:28.643
I'm ronald longcape, junior.

04:28.677 --> 04:30.177
Ok.

04:30.211 --> 04:32.479
I'm alex russo, sophomore.

04:32.513 --> 04:35.181
I should be a junior
but I don't test well.

04:37.583 --> 04:39.717
You gotta show up to not test well.

04:47.559 --> 04:50.227
- Oh, hi. Ronald, right?
- Yes.

04:50.261 --> 04:53.896
Thanks for remembering. - I didn't
really remember. That's why I was asking.

04:53.930 --> 04:56.699
But I did remember your order.

04:56.733 --> 05:00.835
Half of a chocolate shake
and two onion rings.

05:00.870 --> 05:04.238
Wait, that's um...
That's not my order.

05:04.273 --> 05:06.140
That's from the table
you just cleared.

05:08.243 --> 05:10.911
Who can keep any of that straight,
right? - Wait, wait.

05:10.945 --> 05:13.146
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you want
me to take your order?

05:13.180 --> 05:15.681
No, I just want to
keep talking to you.

05:16.949 --> 05:18.449
Oh. Oh, that's sweet.

05:18.783 --> 05:21.017
If I weren't working I would
sit down and talk for a while.

05:21.051 --> 05:22.718
Oh, come on. You look like somebody

05:23.153 --> 05:25.320
Who's always looking for an
excuse to get out of work.

05:25.354 --> 05:26.688
What?

05:26.722 --> 05:28.657
No, I am not.

05:28.691 --> 05:30.292
Here, let's discuss it.

05:32.328 --> 05:34.562
So, how's it going out here?

05:34.596 --> 05:37.898
It's a bunch of rambunctious
teenagers with wizard powers.

05:37.932 --> 05:39.299
How do you think it's going?

05:39.333 --> 05:41.002
Sure, you're angry now.

05:41.037 --> 05:43.906
But I promise, in a year
from now we're gonna laugh.

05:43.940 --> 05:45.874
Hey, let's start now.

05:48.477 --> 05:49.610
No.

05:52.815 --> 05:55.850
Ah, professor crumbs.
Just the guy I'm looking for.

05:55.885 --> 05:59.253
While you're staying with us I got
you a track suit just like mine

05:59.288 --> 06:01.755
- So you'll fit in.
- Thanks.

06:01.790 --> 06:04.458
I'm an 850-year-old wizard.

06:04.492 --> 06:06.726
I think I know how to fit in.

06:06.761 --> 06:10.262
- It makes you look skinny.
- Where's the dressing room?

06:10.297 --> 06:11.997
No need.

06:16.169 --> 06:20.572
Right, sweet. Now, when you walk the
swishy sound makes static electricity.

06:20.606 --> 06:24.108
Go find someone to prank
and shake their hand.

06:32.049 --> 06:34.583
Hey, justin, good to see you.

06:34.618 --> 06:36.552
Oh, professor...

06:38.154 --> 06:40.589
Swishy pants. Gotcha.

06:40.623 --> 06:43.156
I'm glad you all think
that's so funny.

06:43.191 --> 06:46.458
Now, what are we gonna do about the
plastic ball infestation at wiztech?

06:46.493 --> 06:49.527
Oh, justin, don't worry.
Everything will work itself out.

06:49.561 --> 06:52.863
- It sounds like you're doing nothing.
- I'm learning to shock people

06:52.897 --> 06:55.899
With my pants.
I'd hardly call that nothing.

07:11.549 --> 07:13.150
I didn't expect to
see anybody here.

07:13.184 --> 07:14.618
Neither did I.

07:14.652 --> 07:16.585
You must be doing what I'm doing.

07:16.619 --> 07:18.786
Trying to figure out what's
going on with wiztech

07:18.820 --> 07:21.353
And who cursed it.

07:21.388 --> 07:24.656
That's exactly what I'm doing!

07:24.690 --> 07:28.725
So, what have you found?

07:28.759 --> 07:31.694
Oh! You got me!

07:31.729 --> 07:34.296
Oh, you're one smart cookie,
figuring out that

07:34.331 --> 07:37.065
I was the one who infested
wiztech with plastic balls.

07:37.100 --> 07:38.600
You did this?

07:38.634 --> 07:39.966
Why?

07:40.001 --> 07:41.702
For a whole bunch of evil reasons.

07:41.736 --> 07:43.170
Here's my list.

07:44.806 --> 07:46.874
Color balls: Evil.

07:46.908 --> 07:48.042
Check.

07:48.076 --> 07:50.177
Taking over wiztech: Eviler.

07:50.211 --> 07:52.212
Check.

07:52.246 --> 07:54.881
Throwing the birthday
party I never had...

07:56.283 --> 07:57.850
Not so evil, but I'm doing it.

07:59.219 --> 08:01.486
And then what,
are you gonna open up

08:01.521 --> 08:03.554
Like, a totally evil wizard school?

08:03.588 --> 08:05.422
I like that!

08:05.456 --> 08:08.491
After the birthday party.

08:08.526 --> 08:12.628
The only bummer is, my son isn't here.
He got sent off with the wiztech students.

08:12.663 --> 08:16.733
- Who's your son?
- I'm never gonna tell you.

08:16.767 --> 08:19.602
what's your name?

08:19.637 --> 08:21.670
Ronald longcape, senior.

08:21.705 --> 08:25.941
Is your son ronald
longcape, junior?

08:25.975 --> 08:29.310
Are you a detective? - No,
just a smart boy with a curious mind

08:29.345 --> 08:30.978
And the power to stop you.

08:31.013 --> 08:32.813
Spandau ballet tell me it's true

08:32.948 --> 08:34.715
Take this evil man
you know what to do

08:38.820 --> 08:41.821
Aren't you forgetting something?

08:43.890 --> 08:47.758
If we weren't standing knee-deep in plastic
balls I would use magic on you so bad.

08:50.228 --> 08:52.295
Don't go. I... Um...

09:06.807 --> 09:09.208
You! You! Ronald longcape, junior.

09:09.242 --> 09:12.377
I met your father and he's evil
and my guess is, so are you.

09:12.411 --> 09:15.146
Ronald, have you met
my brother, justin?

09:16.582 --> 09:19.417
It's ok, alex. Um... He's right.

09:19.452 --> 09:24.755
My father is evil. - And you know what
he's gonna do now that wiztech is vacant?

09:24.789 --> 09:26.956
He's gonna open up a
totally evil wizard school.

09:26.991 --> 09:29.124
It's ok. Trust me.

09:29.159 --> 09:31.693
My father always thinks big
but he can never deliver.

09:31.727 --> 09:34.261
And look, I'm telling you that.

09:34.295 --> 09:36.963
It's proof that I'm not evil.

09:38.899 --> 09:42.868
Oh, good enough for me.
Justin, can we have a couple menus?

09:42.902 --> 09:46.372
Not good enough for me. The flame
doesn't fall far from the inferno.

09:46.406 --> 09:50.274
If you knew your father was evil then
why didn't you say anything, huh?

09:50.309 --> 09:52.376
Well, because I was afraid.

09:52.411 --> 09:56.546
I thought if people knew my father was evil,
they'd treat me, well,

09:56.580 --> 09:59.181
Kinda like how you're treating
me now. - Yeah, justin.

09:59.216 --> 10:00.949
You're being very rude.

10:00.983 --> 10:02.684
And what are your specials?

10:04.153 --> 10:07.055
We have the turkey pastrami on
rye and a philly cheese steak.

10:07.089 --> 10:08.723
Now listen up!

10:08.757 --> 10:11.391
I'm gonna fix the problems
your father created at wiztech

10:11.426 --> 10:15.328
And if you try and stop me
I'm gonna know you're evil.

10:15.362 --> 10:17.696
Come on, ronald.
I'm sure we can find a restaurant

10:17.730 --> 10:19.764
Where the wait staff
won't call you evil!

10:27.104 --> 10:29.972
That was a really fancy restaurant.

10:30.007 --> 10:32.842
I mean, you got great food,
you got great bowling.

10:32.876 --> 10:35.378
So, maybe we should go back
there again on our next date.

10:35.412 --> 10:36.646
What?

10:36.680 --> 10:38.580
Oh, no, no. This wasn't a date.

10:38.981 --> 10:42.183
Please don't say "date" because I
have a boyfriend and his name is dean.

10:42.217 --> 10:43.618
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:43.652 --> 10:45.386
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

10:45.420 --> 10:46.788
I haven't seen him around.

10:47.256 --> 10:50.558
Well, yeah, 'cause he's probably
in shop class right now,

10:50.592 --> 10:53.760
Making me something that won't
express his true feelings.

10:53.795 --> 10:56.896
Well, let's see how I do.

10:58.898 --> 11:02.433
* there's a rainbow up in heaven *

11:02.467 --> 11:04.968
* and that rainbow spells alex *

11:05.002 --> 11:07.670
* ronald really likes you, girl *

11:13.842 --> 11:16.577
Thank you for a
wonderful day, alex.

11:23.152 --> 11:25.687
Alex, what was going on
out there? Where's dean?

11:25.721 --> 11:28.456
That boy was well inside your
"kiss or clobber" radius.

11:28.491 --> 11:30.457
Oh, um, him? No, no.

11:30.491 --> 11:33.993
That's just a family friend.
He's visiting from wiz...

11:34.028 --> 11:37.363
Uh...Wisconsin, and he said
that we were on a date.

11:37.398 --> 11:39.699
And I said, "no, because I
have a boyfriend, dean."

11:39.734 --> 11:41.934
You do. - Who's not great
at expressing feelings.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.935
- He's not.
- Doesn't mean I don't like him.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.637
- You like him.
- Then ronald left.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.105
- His name's ronald?
- Yes, and I was just with him

11:48.139 --> 11:49.539
And now I kind of miss him.

11:49.774 --> 11:51.874
- You do?
- I do. What am I gonna do?

11:51.909 --> 11:53.909
I'll tell you what
I'm not gonna do.

11:53.944 --> 11:56.545
Study for my history final.
My friend needs me.

11:56.579 --> 11:57.813
Yeah.

12:06.035 --> 12:08.170
Alex, you and dean just broke
the longest relationship record.

12:08.704 --> 12:10.738
I don't know much
about relationships,

12:10.906 --> 12:13.941
But I don't think dating another
guy is the way to celebrate.

12:13.975 --> 12:16.443
I'm not dating ronald.
We just went out to dinner.

12:16.477 --> 12:18.712
Well, it may have
started out as dinner,

12:19.247 --> 12:22.748
But when you guys came back you're all, "I
miss him, I love him, he's the love of my
life."

12:24.351 --> 12:26.385
I never said he was
the love of my life.

12:26.420 --> 12:29.087
I'm sending your story into
a teen magazine for advice

12:29.122 --> 12:32.590
And if you don't let me juice
it up they'll never publish it.

12:32.624 --> 12:34.492
You've got to break up with ronald.

12:34.526 --> 12:37.529
I can't break up with ronald.

12:37.563 --> 12:39.097
I'm not even going out with him.

12:39.131 --> 12:42.166
I see the problem.

12:42.201 --> 12:47.337
Ronald has to go away
for a long, long time.

12:47.372 --> 12:48.838
I'm on it.

12:48.872 --> 12:50.973
Harper, forget that.

12:51.308 --> 12:55.143
Dean's gonna come over so I can tell him I
made a mistake before he finds out from
somebody else

12:55.178 --> 12:58.479
- And it becomes this whole big thing.
- Ok, but if that doesn't work,

12:58.513 --> 13:02.882
I can still make ronald go
away for a long, long time.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.250
What are you gonna do?

13:04.351 --> 13:06.251
Start making him
really uncomfortable

13:06.386 --> 13:09.687
With some of my staring until he goes away.
You know the stare.

13:12.523 --> 13:14.524
Stop it.

13:14.558 --> 13:17.027
You're uncomfortable, aren't you?

13:18.096 --> 13:20.196
Please, harper, stop.

13:24.800 --> 13:28.002
Oh, justin, honey, you'd really
have an easier time in school

13:28.036 --> 13:30.337
If you just dressed
like everybody else.

13:30.372 --> 13:31.906
Mom, please.

13:31.940 --> 13:33.574
I'm dressed for success.

13:33.608 --> 13:36.110
I'm gonna give the wizworld
industry executives

13:36.144 --> 13:39.580
A tour of wiztech so I can convince
them to remove the plastic balls.

13:39.614 --> 13:42.249
Great! Who's gonna
cover your shift?

13:44.451 --> 13:45.785
Me.

13:49.223 --> 13:50.956
Hey, justin, where's your sister?

13:51.325 --> 13:53.859
She told me to come over so I
made her this card in woodshop.

13:53.894 --> 13:56.429
I think I'm finally getting
what she's trying to say,

13:56.463 --> 13:59.096
So I'm trying to say something
I think she might get.

13:59.130 --> 14:01.765
I don't know. She was hanging
out with some dude. Ronald.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.400
Whoa. Ronald?

14:03.434 --> 14:06.235
Yep. His name was
definitely ronald.

14:07.737 --> 14:10.505
Thanks.

14:10.539 --> 14:13.374
Now, 'cause I date your sister I
tell people not to laugh at you.

14:14.776 --> 14:16.410
But you're not
helping me right now.

14:17.612 --> 14:21.080
I'm going on a business trip.

14:21.115 --> 14:23.949
We're gonna tell people you've
got a court date. - All right.

14:23.984 --> 14:26.652
Tell those people I was defending you.
Do you do that?

14:27.220 --> 14:30.789
'cause I need someone. All you have to do
now is prove there's no way I could throw
that far.

14:30.823 --> 14:33.525
I didn't hear that.
I can't be associated with this.

14:37.964 --> 14:40.465
Excuse me.
Are you looking for alex?

14:40.499 --> 14:41.966
Who are you?

14:42.000 --> 14:45.202
I'm ronald longcape, junior.

14:45.236 --> 14:48.037
Dean moragardi. Supposed to be
a junior but I'm a sophomore.

14:48.071 --> 14:49.471
I don't test well.

14:49.506 --> 14:51.273
Hey, hold on.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.374
Alex is off with a
guy named ronald.

14:53.409 --> 14:56.377
- Are you him?
- Um, I'm here with you.

14:56.411 --> 15:00.213
Ah-ha. Exactly. You get that
I don't test well, right?

15:00.248 --> 15:03.316
Look, I think I know where alex is.

15:03.351 --> 15:06.921
- Why don't you come with me?
- All right. Thanks.

15:06.955 --> 15:09.857
Hey, you're ok, ronald.
Let me know if you see that other ronald.

15:09.891 --> 15:11.625
That guy's in big trouble.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.762
Will do.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.966
So, you say you don't
test well? - Nah.

15:23.905 --> 15:26.339
now that you've seen
our wonderful facility

15:26.373 --> 15:28.541
Don't you want to help us
so that we can reopen it

15:28.575 --> 15:30.976
For wizards present and future?

15:31.010 --> 15:34.778
Now, are there any questions?

15:34.813 --> 15:36.913
Can we play in the balls now?

15:40.617 --> 15:43.684
You're the executives
of wizworld industries.

15:43.718 --> 15:46.153
We're not here to
play in the balls.

15:46.187 --> 15:49.589
We're here to see if your company
will help us by removing them.

15:49.623 --> 15:52.325
Ok. We'll help you
clean up the balls

15:52.359 --> 15:55.462
If you let us put up a couple
of wizworld signs around here.

15:55.496 --> 15:59.232
You mean like when sports
drinks sponsor sports arenas?

15:59.267 --> 16:01.167
Yeah, exactly like that.

16:01.201 --> 16:03.935
So, are we gonna play
in these balls or what?

16:03.969 --> 16:05.536
Uh...

16:06.538 --> 16:07.972
Well...

16:08.006 --> 16:10.041
Then, yes. Sure, yes.

16:10.075 --> 16:12.009
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

16:14.279 --> 16:17.748
So does this mean we're
getting our school back? Yeah!

16:17.783 --> 16:20.818
Make way! Ow! Ow!

16:20.853 --> 16:22.887
This is unprofessional.

16:30.596 --> 16:34.466
Dean, I'm glad you came over. - Me, too.
There's something I need to talk to you
about.

16:34.500 --> 16:38.535
No, there's something I need to talk to
you about. I wanted to do it in person.

16:38.569 --> 16:40.734
Oh, here, let me
text you right now.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.877
"it's just not working out.
I'm breaking up with you."

16:53.112 --> 16:55.880
What? Wait, what are you saying?

17:01.353 --> 17:04.421
"I can't believe this, dean."

17:09.560 --> 17:13.095
"well, you should,
because..." what are we doing?

17:13.128 --> 17:14.930
You can't be breaking up with me.

17:15.431 --> 17:18.165
Is this because somebody already told
you I was hanging out with this guy?

17:18.200 --> 17:20.401
You mean ronald,
'cause I heard all about that.

17:20.435 --> 17:23.604
Dean, it's true, but it was
just a big misunderstanding.

17:23.637 --> 17:26.839
Ronald's a nice guy and he likes
me and he treated me special,

17:26.874 --> 17:29.175
- But you're my boyfriend.
- Not anymore, I'm not.

17:29.776 --> 17:32.577
Maybe you should make that ronald your
boyfriend. - What are you doing? Stop.

17:32.611 --> 17:34.679
I am stopping. Stopping seeing you.

17:34.713 --> 17:36.347
Forever.

17:36.381 --> 17:38.582
See you in school.

17:49.026 --> 17:53.695
I know you. You're ronald and you better get
out of here, because dean's coming over.

17:53.729 --> 17:57.066
I'm not too worried about dean.

17:58.535 --> 18:00.936
Hey, look. I think I
know where alex is.

18:00.970 --> 18:03.337
Why don't you come with me?

18:03.372 --> 18:05.573
All right, thanks.
Hey, you're ok, ronald.

18:05.607 --> 18:07.475
Let me know if you see
that other ronald.

18:07.509 --> 18:09.076
That guy's in big trouble.

18:09.110 --> 18:11.178
Will do.

18:13.114 --> 18:15.448
So, you say you don't
test well? - Nah.

18:18.452 --> 18:21.654
- Alex isn't in here.
- That's weird.

18:21.688 --> 18:24.289
I thought she was.

18:24.323 --> 18:27.158
Hold on a minute.
You'rehat other ronald.

18:27.192 --> 18:29.994
Piggly wiggly, get in the jiggly

18:35.866 --> 18:40.169
All right. Now, time for
my little dean impression.

18:40.204 --> 18:43.740
Yeah, it's gonna go a
little something like this.

18:50.014 --> 18:52.315
I'm dean. I don't test well.

18:52.350 --> 18:54.051
That'll do.

19:04.463 --> 19:07.532
- That makes me uncomfortable.
- Because it's working.

19:18.975 --> 19:20.410
Guys! Guys!

19:20.444 --> 19:22.511
Guess what?

19:22.546 --> 19:25.448
I saved wiztech. You're welcome.

19:25.482 --> 19:27.616
- How'd you do it, justin?
- It's complicated,

19:27.851 --> 19:30.451
But I got wizworld industries
to remove all the plastic balls

19:30.686 --> 19:35.123
And all we've got to do is let them put
up a few signs advertising their products.

19:35.157 --> 19:37.992
Ooh, like sports drinks
do with sports arenas.

19:38.026 --> 19:40.027
Yes.

19:40.062 --> 19:41.329
Ahh!

19:41.363 --> 19:43.164
Swishy pants gotcha.

19:45.633 --> 19:49.068
You're the one with the beard
and I'm the mature one.

19:58.008 --> 20:00.608
I just wish I could stop
thinking about dean.

20:01.940 --> 20:04.372
See, I know that if I
was your boyfriend,

20:04.406 --> 20:07.172
See, I wouldn't give you
stupid wooden gifts.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.808
How did you know he
gave me wooden gifts?

20:12.711 --> 20:14.044
Um...

20:14.079 --> 20:16.879
It's a classic stupid guy move.

20:17.981 --> 20:22.250
But this is what a
good guy would do.

20:27.421 --> 20:30.689
"I like you. Do you like me?
Check yes or no."

20:33.359 --> 20:35.226
Yes.

20:39.732 --> 20:42.935
Oh, alex, this is perfect.

20:44.904 --> 20:49.040
more perfect than you
could ever imagine.

20:51.909 --> 20:53.643
Wait, why did you say it like that?

20:54.745 --> 20:56.312
No reason.

20:57.948 --> 21:01.050
Well, thanks for taking my
mind off things tonight.

21:01.084 --> 21:02.751
You kinda make me feel special.

21:02.785 --> 21:06.121
Now that your brother
saved wiztech,

21:06.155 --> 21:08.256
And we're going back,

21:08.290 --> 21:11.391
I'm gonna miss you, alex.

21:11.426 --> 21:13.226
And I know it's only been two days,

21:13.260 --> 21:15.928
But it seems like I've known you...

21:15.962 --> 21:17.929
...At least a week.

21:20.699 --> 21:22.133
I'll miss you, too.

21:24.435 --> 21:26.236
Hey, you know what?

21:26.270 --> 21:30.205
Why don't you come back
to wiztech with me?

21:30.240 --> 21:32.274
Really? That seems so sudden.

21:32.308 --> 21:36.477
Yeah, but doesn't it also
seem romantic? - Yeah.

21:36.512 --> 21:39.447
And we can be that couple at
wiztech that everyone looks up to.

21:39.481 --> 21:42.350
Maybe we can even break the
record for longest relationship.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.652
Two months. - I know where
we could get a banner.

21:47.022 --> 21:50.057
You know what?
Maybe change is good.

21:50.091 --> 21:52.359
I'll go back to wiztech with you,

21:52.393 --> 21:55.961
And we'll see about you and me.

21:55.996 --> 21:57.763
That's perfect.

21:59.599 --> 22:03.434
oh, more perfect than
you will ever know.
