00:05.309 --> 00:08.791
DUNN:
Left, left, left, right, left.

00:08.834 --> 00:11.881
ALL:
Left, left, left, right, left.

00:11.924 --> 00:15.058
Mama, Mama, don't you cry.

00:15.102 --> 00:17.887
ALL:
Mama, Mama, don't you cry.

00:17.930 --> 00:21.064
Marine Corps motto
is do or die.

00:21.108 --> 00:23.893
ALL: Marine corps motto is...Detail, halt.

00:23.936 --> 00:27.549
Left face.

00:27.592 --> 00:29.986
Ready? One.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.727
Two.

00:31.770 --> 00:33.990
Three. Four.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.731
Come on, five more.

00:35.774 --> 00:37.211
Give 'em all you got!

00:37.254 --> 00:38.777
Come on, Torres,

00:38.821 --> 00:40.214
you can do this,
all right?

00:40.257 --> 00:43.565
Excuse me, did I tell
you to stop moving?!

00:43.608 --> 00:46.655
Detail, a-ten-hut!

00:46.698 --> 00:48.570
Right face.

00:48.613 --> 00:50.485
Double time march!

00:50.528 --> 00:52.400
Go!

00:52.443 --> 00:54.750
Come on, Torres. Pick it up.
You can do this.

00:54.793 --> 00:56.404
Let's go.

00:56.447 --> 00:59.929
Come on, don't slow down now.
I want to see you hustle!

00:59.972 --> 01:02.497
Hustle, come on!
Double time. Let's...

01:11.984 --> 01:14.509
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:14.552 --> 01:17.120
♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:17.164 --> 01:19.644
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:19.688 --> 01:20.950
♪ How, how, how, how

01:20.993 --> 01:23.300
♪ Hey, hey

01:29.176 --> 01:30.525
♪ You gotta come on.

01:34.703 --> 01:37.140
PRIDE: Ooh, those kouign-amann
smell like heaven on earth.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.750
Well, they better.

01:38.794 --> 01:41.144
I was up at 4:00 to
bake them this morning.

01:41.188 --> 01:43.451
Mm.
Labor of love.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.322
You're really taking
to your work.

01:45.366 --> 01:49.152
Yeah, good job, good people.
All thanks to you.

01:49.196 --> 01:52.373
Well, I've spent a fortune
in this place over the years.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.723
Alma hired you to
protect my investment.

01:54.766 --> 01:56.768
ALMA: I don't care,
you need to leave.

01:56.812 --> 02:00.294
LEO: Not until I talk to him.ALMA: He's not here.

02:00.337 --> 02:02.470
Where is Mateo?I told you.

02:02.513 --> 02:05.473
What's that about?Alma won't say.

02:05.516 --> 02:08.345
It's not the first time
that dude's been around.

02:08.389 --> 02:10.304
You need to leave me alone.

02:10.347 --> 02:11.522
Maybe I should introduce myself.

02:11.566 --> 02:13.481
Or maybe that would
just cause trouble.

02:13.524 --> 02:17.963
I got my eyes open. I'll let
you know if there's a problem.

02:18.007 --> 02:20.792
If you say so.I do.

02:20.836 --> 02:23.708
In the meantime,
you owe me $26.50.

02:23.752 --> 02:26.276
Whoa. No family discount?

02:26.320 --> 02:28.844
I treat every
customer the same.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.498
Trying to keep
this job, remember?

02:32.717 --> 02:36.852
Mm. Morning, Steven.THOMPSON: Dwayne.

02:36.895 --> 02:38.375
Tell me you're on your way.

02:38.419 --> 02:40.160
I'm on my way.For real?

02:40.203 --> 02:41.900
Because it doesn't sound like
you're driving.

02:41.944 --> 02:43.075
20 minutes out.

02:43.119 --> 02:45.034
Our meeting with the team

02:45.077 --> 02:47.558
from the I.G.'s office
starts in 15.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.734
Well, then chances are

02:49.778 --> 02:51.083
I will be late.

02:51.127 --> 02:52.868
What should I tell them?

02:52.911 --> 02:54.217
Tell them I'm bringing them

02:54.261 --> 02:55.697
a couple boxes
of the best pastries

02:55.740 --> 02:57.046
in New Orleans.

02:57.089 --> 02:59.875
They better be good.

03:00.919 --> 03:02.443
Trouble with the work wife?

03:02.486 --> 03:06.142
Nothing but, uh, domestic bliss.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.318
Keep the change, Jimmy.

03:08.362 --> 03:09.972
I'm late.

03:17.545 --> 03:20.069
Well, hey.

03:20.112 --> 03:21.201
Hey.
Thanks, Gregorio.

03:21.244 --> 03:22.811
Don't thank me yet.

03:22.854 --> 03:25.596
It's straight from
the teacher's lounge.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.597
Blech.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.991
That bad?No, not the coffee,

03:29.034 --> 03:30.862
high school. Bad mojo.

03:30.906 --> 03:33.387
Really? I would've pegged you
as one of the cool kids.

03:33.430 --> 03:36.738
Yeah, my parents were
adjunct college professors.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.348
Meant a new town
every few semesters.

03:38.392 --> 03:41.264
I had three high schools,
four years.

03:41.308 --> 03:42.744
Always the new girl.

03:42.787 --> 03:44.659
Bad hair and braces.You wouldn't
have one of those

03:44.702 --> 03:46.269
yearbook pictures
lying around, would you?

03:46.313 --> 03:47.488
Mm-mm.
Burned them all.

03:49.185 --> 03:50.621
Hey.
Hey.

03:50.665 --> 03:52.144
WADE:
Sergeant Kate Dunn.

03:54.190 --> 03:55.931
Penetrating stab wounds
and a bloody knife

03:55.974 --> 03:58.586
suggests a rather
vicious scenario.

03:58.629 --> 04:01.284
Killer left the murder weapon.
Amateur move.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.112
I'm not sure they had a choice.

04:03.155 --> 04:05.897
The blade is lodged
in the T8 vertebrae.

04:05.941 --> 04:08.944
It's difficult and
time consuming to remove.

04:08.987 --> 04:10.380
HANNAH:
I'm guessing the suspect

04:10.424 --> 04:11.773
didn't stick around
long enough to be seen.

04:11.816 --> 04:13.949
Yeah, well, hopefully
they left behind some DNA.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.300
Sergeant Dunn
teach at this school?

04:17.344 --> 04:19.563
JROTC instructor.
She was on a training run

04:19.607 --> 04:21.086
this morning with
her 12-person unit.

04:21.130 --> 04:24.046
Dozen potential witnesses.Or suspects.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.395
These programs
are designed

04:25.439 --> 04:26.962
to push students
to their limits.

04:27.005 --> 04:29.443
Maybe Dunn pushed one
of her's too far.

04:29.486 --> 04:31.532
I almost signed up for JROTC,

04:31.575 --> 04:32.837
junior year.

04:32.881 --> 04:34.709
Yeah, you wouldn't have lasted
five minutes.

04:34.752 --> 04:38.147
My mom said the same thing
with the same tone.

04:39.366 --> 04:42.064
We need to interview
every kid in Dunn's unit.

04:42.107 --> 04:45.110
Guess we're going
back to high school.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.290
Nobody heard anything,
nobody saw anything,

04:50.333 --> 04:52.553
and not one of these kids
said please or thank you.

04:52.596 --> 04:56.426
Oh, my God, I'm becoming my
parents. Anyway, bottom line is

04:56.470 --> 04:57.862
none of them noticed
that Dunn was missing

04:57.906 --> 04:59.386
until they got back
to the locker room.Yeah,

04:59.429 --> 05:01.823
then they went back to class
like nothing ever happened.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.172
Teenagers, huh?

05:03.215 --> 05:05.261
Bunch of moody,
hormonal sociopaths.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.568
Agreed, but in their defense,

05:07.611 --> 05:10.527
their frontal lobes
aren't fully developed yet.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.921
MARI: Hey, is this

05:12.964 --> 05:14.662
the place where I'm supposed
to be interviewed?

05:14.705 --> 05:17.534
Yeah, an hour ago.I know I'm late.

05:17.578 --> 05:19.362
I just kind of freaked out,
you know?

05:19.406 --> 05:21.233
I have a chem test
third period.

05:21.277 --> 05:25.237
Think you could
write me a note?

05:25.281 --> 05:27.239
Why don't we talk first.
You're...?

05:27.283 --> 05:28.545
Mari Foster.

05:28.589 --> 05:30.025
I'm Special Agent Khoury.

05:30.068 --> 05:31.679
This is Special
Agent Gregorio.

05:31.722 --> 05:33.855
Why don't you
turn that off

05:33.898 --> 05:37.424
and tell us about
Sergeant Dunn, huh.

05:37.467 --> 05:40.557
Listen, I'm only in JROTC
for extracurriculars.

05:41.906 --> 05:43.517
It's not my life or anything.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.866
Duly noted, but Sergeant Dunn

05:44.909 --> 05:46.520
was stabbed 50 feet
away from you.

05:46.563 --> 05:49.044
I didn't see anything.Fair enough.

05:49.087 --> 05:50.959
Let me ask you something else.

05:51.002 --> 05:52.743
Renjun, Jeno, or Chenle?
Who's the best?

05:54.092 --> 05:56.791
None of them.
It's Mark, obviously.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.227
What are, what are these names?

05:58.270 --> 06:01.752
It's K-pop.
And how do you know them?

06:01.796 --> 06:04.581
Oh, I don't just know them,
I hung out with them

06:04.625 --> 06:06.148
when I used to live
in Busan.

06:06.191 --> 06:08.585
What the hell is KKorean pop music.

06:08.629 --> 06:11.240
It's kind of a big deal,
Gregorio. I'll school her later.

06:11.283 --> 06:13.024
About Sergeant Dunn now.

06:13.068 --> 06:16.898
Did she have any issues

06:16.941 --> 06:18.943
with anyone in the unit?

06:18.987 --> 06:21.903
I mean... no?

06:21.946 --> 06:23.295
Is that a question?

06:23.339 --> 06:26.429
I just don't want to, like,
profile or anything,

06:26.473 --> 06:30.781
but if I had to say,
Mateo was sort of extra.

06:30.825 --> 06:33.349
Mateo Diaz

06:33.393 --> 06:34.959
He's got no family.

06:35.003 --> 06:37.266
Moved here from
Central America by himself.

06:39.486 --> 06:42.793
They say he killed someone back
home and came here to hide out.

06:42.837 --> 06:45.013
Sounds like a rumor to me.

06:45.056 --> 06:48.103
Look, you asked, I told you,
and Sergeant Dunn was always

06:48.146 --> 06:49.409
pulling him
to the side, so...

06:51.062 --> 06:53.195
Mateo Diaz wasn't
in school today.

06:53.238 --> 06:54.675
He hasn't been around all week.

06:54.718 --> 06:57.329
May be a rumor
worth looking into.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.333
LASALLE:
All right, thanks.

07:01.377 --> 07:03.161
We'll keep looking.

07:03.205 --> 07:05.163
Mateo Diaz lives
in a boarding house.

07:05.207 --> 07:06.948
Hasn't showed up
in a week.

07:06.991 --> 07:08.602
Can you imagine
being 17,

07:08.645 --> 07:10.778
living 2,000 miles away
from home all alone?

07:10.821 --> 07:13.607
But it makes him and guys
like him a prime target

07:13.650 --> 07:14.999
for gang recruitment.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.610
Giving them something
to belong to.

07:16.653 --> 07:19.134
I'm not sure Mateo fits the
gang profile. Check this out.

07:20.831 --> 07:24.313
Honor roll, AP classes,
extracurriculars.

07:24.356 --> 07:26.968
Works two jobs.
A bike shop in the afternoons,

07:27.011 --> 07:28.186
bakery in the mornings.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.753
Not just any bakery, Desiree's.

07:29.797 --> 07:31.363
Yeah, by the Trutone.
I love that place.

07:31.407 --> 07:32.800
Come on, I'll drive.

07:32.843 --> 07:35.150
Nope, I got this.
You keep digging.

07:35.193 --> 07:36.760
All right, well,
just get me, like,

07:36.804 --> 07:40.198
a
I didn't have breakfast.

07:46.901 --> 07:49.164
And now Special Agent
in Charge Pride

07:49.207 --> 07:50.774
and I will present

07:50.818 --> 07:53.168
our comprehensive plan for
improving agent productivity

07:53.211 --> 07:56.650
and man-hour
efficiency by 11%.

07:56.693 --> 08:00.044
I'm confident
you'll find the analytics

08:00.088 --> 08:01.742
as exciting as we do.

08:04.179 --> 08:07.008
Sorry. Oh... I hate to miss
a second of this party,

08:07.051 --> 08:09.401
but, um, I do need to take this.

08:09.445 --> 08:12.056
Sorry. That looks good,
though. I like that.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.757
Christopher, I owe you one.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.498
Happy to hear it, King,

08:18.541 --> 08:20.500
'cause I'm gonna call
on that favor right now.

08:20.543 --> 08:22.066
What do you got?

08:22.110 --> 08:24.068
A JROTC instructor
murdered this morning.

08:24.112 --> 08:26.767
I'm trying to track down
a student who could be involved.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.812
Works at Desiree's.Mateo Diaz?

08:28.856 --> 08:30.684
You know him?Eh, just in passing.

08:30.727 --> 08:32.294
He works with Jimmy
in the mornings.

08:32.337 --> 08:34.557
Well, that's more than
what Jimmy would tell me.

08:34.601 --> 08:37.995
He shut down before I could ask
a single question. Alma, too.

08:38.039 --> 08:41.782
Gets a little shy around
a badge. Old habits die hard.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.218
I figured helping
saving his life

08:43.261 --> 08:44.872
would've bought me
some goodwill.

08:44.915 --> 08:46.569
King, I know you're busy,

08:46.613 --> 08:49.006
but could you call him?
Ask him to cooperate?

08:49.050 --> 08:52.096
I mean, I need to find
this kid ASAP.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.185
I'll do you one better.

08:58.407 --> 08:59.974
JIMMY:
Mateo hasn't shown up for work

09:00.017 --> 09:02.063
the last few days.
That's all I know.

09:02.106 --> 09:04.892
This normal behavior
for him, Alma?
No.

09:04.935 --> 09:08.722
He's a good kid,
always prompt.

09:08.765 --> 09:10.898
You think something's wrong?

09:10.941 --> 09:13.422
LASALLE: All right,
so he hasn't

09:13.465 --> 09:16.338
been to school
or his boarding house.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.253
Any idea where
he could be staying?

09:18.296 --> 09:20.603
No.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.387
Who he could be staying with?

09:22.431 --> 09:25.260
No.You sure?

09:25.303 --> 09:27.871
Look, whatever Mateo's into,
Alma got nothing to do with it.

09:27.915 --> 09:29.743
So let her get back
to work now, huh?

09:29.786 --> 09:33.660
Yeah, of course.
Go ahead, Alma.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.139
Thank you.

09:37.141 --> 09:38.621
Not you, Jimmy.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.623
Have a seat.

09:43.321 --> 09:45.454
If I knew anything, I'd say so.

09:45.497 --> 09:46.673
Why is Alma so scared?

09:46.716 --> 09:48.457
Who says she's scared?

09:48.500 --> 09:50.938
We got a murdered Marine,
Mateo is missing,

09:50.981 --> 09:52.374
and no one is talking.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.245
We're not
the enemies here.

09:54.289 --> 09:57.205
Every time I've heard a cop say
that, my life's gotten worse.

09:57.248 --> 09:59.076
You've never heard me say that.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.427
Look, I know you care
about Mateo and Alma,

10:02.471 --> 10:04.778
but if you think
he's in trouble,

10:04.821 --> 10:07.389
trusting us
is the best way to help.

10:07.432 --> 10:10.784
You're not the only ones
trying to find him.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.481
The punk you saw
with Alma this morning,

10:12.524 --> 10:13.917
he's looking for him, too.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.092
Gang related?

10:15.136 --> 10:18.661
I don't know. Probably.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.489
That's not Mateo's style.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.317
We need to
find him, Jimmy.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.929
The way you're acting makes me
feel like you know where he is.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.679
PRIDE: Jimmy says Mateo
comes here to clear his head.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.159
LASALLE:
Strange place to do that.

10:38.202 --> 10:41.075
PRIDE:
Yeah. Christopher, up there.

10:41.118 --> 10:42.163
That's Mateo.

10:43.947 --> 10:47.081
PRIDE: Mateo Diaz, we'd
like to ask you some ques...

10:47.124 --> 10:49.344
LASALLE:
Hey, Mateo, wait.

10:49.387 --> 10:51.041
Stop!

10:56.873 --> 11:00.268
It's all right, Mateo.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.009
We just want to
talk to you, okay?

11:02.052 --> 11:04.707
We're not gonna hurt you.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.491
NOPD! Nobody move!

11:17.764 --> 11:19.591
Mateo Diaz is a person
of interest

11:19.635 --> 11:21.115
in a homicide investigation.

11:21.158 --> 11:22.725
Yeah, let me save you some time.
He's innocent.

11:22.769 --> 11:25.075
LASALLE:
Now, how do you know that?Because I know Mateo.

11:25.119 --> 11:27.034
He's my C.I.Well, that doesn't mean

11:27.077 --> 11:28.296
he's not involved.

11:28.339 --> 11:29.863
We question him
back at NCIS.

11:29.906 --> 11:32.126
I can't let him
go anywhere with you.Just hold on.

11:32.169 --> 11:34.302
Who's Mateo informing on?

11:36.173 --> 11:37.609
The Aztec Kings.

11:37.653 --> 11:40.264
You're telling me
a Central American gang

11:40.308 --> 11:41.744
is operating in New Orleans?

11:41.788 --> 11:43.224
Yeah. They're everywhere.

11:43.267 --> 11:44.747
It's true, Christopher.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.401
The National Gang
Intelligence Center says

11:46.444 --> 11:48.577
they're in 12 American cities.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.274
And this young man is
doing his part

11:50.318 --> 11:52.059
to track and dismantle them
from the inside.

11:52.102 --> 11:54.452
PRIDE:
And I appreciate that,

11:54.496 --> 11:56.411
but the fact of the matter is
he could have information

11:56.454 --> 11:58.761
about the murder
of a JROTC instructor.

11:58.805 --> 12:01.546
Sergeant Dunn is dead?

12:03.635 --> 12:05.246
She is.

12:05.289 --> 12:08.597
You need to tell us
everything you know.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.772
Mateo, don't say a word.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.992
Carter, what's your
problem, man?

12:12.035 --> 12:14.646
I got to get him off the streets
before the Aztec Kings find out

12:14.690 --> 12:16.083
that he's talking
to law enforcement.

12:16.126 --> 12:18.781
If keeping this boy safe
is a priority,

12:18.825 --> 12:24.395
I assure you NCIS is a much
better place to do it right now.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.049
We'll sort it out together.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.184
Okay.

12:30.227 --> 12:31.446
But I'm coming with you.

12:36.407 --> 12:40.716
Sergeant Dunn was
a tough instructor.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.501
Other kids in your unit said
you were singled out.

12:43.545 --> 12:46.940
No, it wasn't
like that at all.

12:46.983 --> 12:49.725
Then tell me what
it was like.

12:53.076 --> 12:55.078
She was the only one
who ever listened.

12:55.122 --> 12:59.822
The only one who gave a crap
about what was happening to me.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.345
Just take your time.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.478
My family sent me here.

13:03.521 --> 13:06.089
The government
granted me asylum...

13:08.222 --> 13:11.399
...to get away from
the Aztec Kings back home.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.318
To escape the violence.

13:17.361 --> 13:22.497
Hardworking, conscientious,
honor student.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.847
I'm sure your family's proud.

13:24.891 --> 13:28.372
But there's no escaping
the Aztec Kings.

13:28.416 --> 13:31.549
They were here, too.
They found me.

13:31.593 --> 13:33.377
Forced you to join.

13:33.421 --> 13:37.164
I had to move drugs for them,
or they would kill my parents.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.166
You told Sergeant Dunn?

13:39.209 --> 13:42.604
I wanted a future, to be free.

13:44.388 --> 13:46.521
She introduced me
to Officer Carter.

13:46.564 --> 13:48.349
Said he could help me get out.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.699
If you became a C.I.

13:50.742 --> 13:52.832
Mm-mm. That was my idea.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.794
You volunteered?

14:01.014 --> 14:02.842
Mm-hmm.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.800
Somebody has to fight back.

14:06.106 --> 14:08.021
So why not me?

14:11.111 --> 14:14.114
You want to maybe
take a break from pacing?

14:14.157 --> 14:16.464
I'm exhausted just watching you.

14:16.507 --> 14:18.901
You have no idea how dangerous
the Aztec Kings are.

14:18.945 --> 14:21.469
No? They were formed

14:21.512 --> 14:25.081
as a narcotics distribution arm
of the Guatemalan Sinaloas

14:25.125 --> 14:27.083
and evolved into the most brutal
gang in Central America.

14:27.127 --> 14:28.519
GREGORIO: In the States,
they run drugs,

14:28.563 --> 14:30.130
contract murders,
extort local communities.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.827
HANNAH: We also know
how rare it is

14:31.871 --> 14:33.307
to get current members to flip.

14:33.350 --> 14:35.222
Compromised informants
usually turn up in pieces.

14:35.265 --> 14:36.658
That's if they turn up at all.

14:36.701 --> 14:39.182
Which is exactly why
I need to keep Mateo's cover

14:39.226 --> 14:40.270
from being blown.

14:40.314 --> 14:43.056
Well, it may be
too late for that.

14:43.099 --> 14:46.798
Mateo has been ditching
school and work

14:46.842 --> 14:50.585
because the Aztec Kings
are looking for him,

14:50.628 --> 14:52.543
not because he killed
Sergeant Dunn.

14:52.587 --> 14:55.155
Then who did?

14:55.198 --> 14:58.201
Sergeant Dunn
introduced me to Mateo.

14:58.245 --> 15:00.943
If the Aztec Kings found out
that he was a C.I.,

15:00.987 --> 15:02.423
they could have
gone after her.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.425
We have to get Mateo
into protective custody.

15:04.468 --> 15:06.601
No, no, y-you turn him over
to the Feds,

15:06.644 --> 15:08.603
they'll deport him
back to Guatemala.

15:08.646 --> 15:09.909
He's just a scared kid.

15:09.952 --> 15:12.346
With an affiliation
to a known street gang.

15:12.389 --> 15:14.739
It's a violation of his
conditional asylum status.

15:14.783 --> 15:18.439
So this kid is screwed because
he tried to do the right thing?Not if the D.A.

15:18.482 --> 15:21.224
gives him a plea deal
in exchange for testimony

15:21.268 --> 15:22.573
against the Kings.

15:22.617 --> 15:23.792
Which is where
I'll take him now.

15:23.835 --> 15:26.273
Okay, he is safer here
in custody with us

15:26.316 --> 15:27.622
until it's all sorted out.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.450
Assuming Mateo is
no longer a suspect

15:29.493 --> 15:30.886
in Sergeant Dunn's murder.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.584
Yeah, he's not.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.717
Then you have no authority
to keep him here.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.458
He's coming with me.No, he's not.

15:37.501 --> 15:38.676
Gregorio, he's right.

15:38.720 --> 15:41.810
Just get him to the D.A.
as quick as you can.

15:41.853 --> 15:43.638
You need anything,
you let us know.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.422
You can go out the back.

15:45.466 --> 15:47.729
No one will see you
that way.

15:47.772 --> 15:50.123
Please keep him safe.

15:50.166 --> 15:53.953
Sergeant Dunn was
one of the good ones.

15:53.996 --> 15:56.346
Nail the scum that
did this to her.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.699
So, we're thinking
the Aztec Kings

16:01.743 --> 16:04.572
killed Dunn as punishment
for turning Mateo.

16:04.615 --> 16:06.008
They want to send
a message to anyone

16:06.052 --> 16:07.140
that wants to betray them.

16:07.183 --> 16:09.055
Both sound theories,

16:09.098 --> 16:11.492
but we need hard evidence
to connect the Aztec Kings

16:11.535 --> 16:13.320
to Sergeant Dunn's murder.

16:13.363 --> 16:15.757
I know you need to get
back to Belle Chasse

16:15.800 --> 16:18.194
and the DoD team;
I'll keep you posted.

16:18.238 --> 16:21.415
Thompson can handle the DoD.

16:21.458 --> 16:22.894
I'm not going anywhere.

16:29.814 --> 16:31.033
I hope you found
some evidence

16:31.077 --> 16:33.035
that leads us back
to the Aztec Kings.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.863
You tell me,
Christopher.

16:34.906 --> 16:36.386
This attack was premeditated

16:36.430 --> 16:39.259
with the intent to inflict
maximum damage.

16:39.302 --> 16:43.350
Both her lungs were punctured,
leading to a hemothorax,

16:43.393 --> 16:45.874
ensuring there was no possible
way she could scream for help.

16:45.917 --> 16:48.529
Well, that definitely fits
the Aztec Kings' M.O.,

16:48.572 --> 16:50.052
but it's not the
direct link we need.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.967
Well, you ask and I deliver.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.187
So, it turns out that
the Aztec Kings have

16:54.230 --> 16:56.189
a very specific
initiation ceremony.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.321
Each member is given
a homemade knife

16:58.365 --> 17:00.019
that's very similar
to our murder weapon here.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.890
What's the star etching
on the blade for?

17:01.933 --> 17:03.370
Well, that represents
the gang member's name.

17:03.413 --> 17:04.936
So, each knife is
personalized.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.113
So, if we find the person
who owns this particular one...

17:07.156 --> 17:09.028
Then we find
Sergeant Dunn's killer.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.162
Meet the New Orleans
Aztec Kings.

17:13.206 --> 17:15.077
We've compiled everything
we can through social media.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.166
Don't quite look like
a typical gang.

17:17.210 --> 17:18.602
They present nice
and neat to avoid

17:18.646 --> 17:19.908
being hassled by
law enforcement.

17:19.951 --> 17:21.866
They don't communicate
typically either.

17:21.910 --> 17:24.130
Every move they make is
shared through benign posts.

17:24.173 --> 17:26.567
Coded communication about
their criminal activity.

17:26.610 --> 17:28.395
A party they're throwing
might be a drug deal.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.223
Wishing someone a happy birthday
might be a hit.

17:30.266 --> 17:32.138
Or so we think.PRIDE: Who needs burner phones

17:32.181 --> 17:34.401
when you can distribute drugs
and orchestrate a murder

17:34.444 --> 17:36.620
over social media?Sebastian's broken
some of the code,

17:36.664 --> 17:39.667
but hasn't flagged any chatter
about Mateo or Sergeant Dunn.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.799
Well, what about
the murder weapon?

17:41.843 --> 17:44.715
Sebastian's working through
the NGIC gang-member database

17:44.759 --> 17:46.717
to match the knife
symbol to a name.

17:46.761 --> 17:48.545
And, as you can see,
it's gonna take some time.

17:48.589 --> 17:49.851
Okay, h-hang on, hang on.

17:49.894 --> 17:52.114
Go back, go back one.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.203
The guy who was

17:54.247 --> 17:56.466
harassing Alma
at the bakery this morning

17:56.510 --> 17:57.598
looking for Mateo.

17:57.641 --> 17:59.382
Leo Reyes.
He's a shot-caller.

17:59.426 --> 18:00.601
We got an address?

18:00.644 --> 18:01.819
I'll get an address
from the MAG Unit.

18:01.863 --> 18:03.256
Call from the car.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.086
♪

18:14.267 --> 18:15.442
You two must be lost.

18:15.485 --> 18:17.226
This is private property.

18:17.270 --> 18:18.967
Not looking for trouble, Leo.

18:19.010 --> 18:21.839
Just want to talk.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.582
I'm Special Agent Pride.

18:25.626 --> 18:26.670
I know who you are.

18:26.714 --> 18:28.672
Navy cop, right?

18:29.847 --> 18:32.633
I don't see any ships
around here, though.

18:34.069 --> 18:35.636
We're gonna need you
to come with us, Leo.

18:35.679 --> 18:37.464
No.It's not a request.

18:37.507 --> 18:39.292
If you were here to arrest me,
I'd be in cuffs,

18:39.335 --> 18:40.858
and you'd have backup.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.425
What do you know about Marine
Corps Sergeant Katie Dunn?

18:42.469 --> 18:44.166
Nothing. We finished?

18:44.210 --> 18:47.822
She was stabbed to death
with a knife like you

18:47.865 --> 18:51.608
and all your friends have
tucked in their belts.

18:51.652 --> 18:52.957
Must be a coincidence.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.176
Thanks for dropping by.

18:54.220 --> 18:56.004
Coincidence, huh?

18:56.047 --> 18:58.137
Like the coincidence
of you being

18:58.180 --> 19:01.488
at Desiree's this morning
looking for Mateo Diaz?

19:03.881 --> 19:05.579
Mateo's like family, man.

19:05.622 --> 19:07.972
He hasn't been around.
Kind of worried.

19:08.016 --> 19:10.192
Wouldn't you be?

19:10.236 --> 19:13.543
I don't force my family
to commit felonies on my behalf.

19:13.587 --> 19:16.242
You got us all wrong, friend.

19:16.285 --> 19:18.853
The Aztec Kings are
a social club.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.681
We're all about
peace and love, right?

19:21.986 --> 19:24.206
But I promise you,

19:24.250 --> 19:29.037
when we do find Mateo...

19:29.080 --> 19:30.430
we'll tell him you said hello.

19:30.473 --> 19:32.171
You're gonna leave
that kid alone, you understand?

19:34.042 --> 19:35.957
Otherwise, you and me,
we're gonna have problems.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.743
I think you're the one
with the problem right now.

19:48.665 --> 19:50.406
Pride, behind the house!

20:09.643 --> 20:11.819
I can't believe those kids
shot at a federal agent.

20:11.862 --> 20:14.125
Yeah, if they'd wanted
to hit us, they would have.

20:14.169 --> 20:16.911
It was just a distraction
so they could get away.

20:16.954 --> 20:18.391
So you didn't catch any?

20:18.434 --> 20:19.827
By the time NOPD got there,

20:19.870 --> 20:21.611
Reyes and his crew were
just scattered in the wind.

20:21.655 --> 20:23.004
Where's Pride?

20:23.047 --> 20:24.397
On his way to the D.A.'s office
to check on Mateo.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.268
LASALLE: He's not gonna
find him there.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.704
Yeah, Mateo's
asylum I.D. number

20:27.748 --> 20:29.576
just pinged at an
ICE detention center.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.055
There's got to be
some Aztec Kings there.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.405
Yeah, there's also a lot
of really good kids

20:32.448 --> 20:34.276
there, too, just caught up
in a bad situation.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.277
Wait, Officer Carter was
supposed to take him

20:35.321 --> 20:36.539
straight to the D.A.'s office.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.149
How did they end up
at a detention center?

20:38.193 --> 20:39.977
I'm guessing that's
a question for Carter.

20:40.021 --> 20:41.196
He's the one who
brought him there.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.502
Son of a bitch lied to us all.

20:42.545 --> 20:44.199
I want to know why.LASALLE: Yeah, so do I.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.853
But he's not answering
his phone,

20:45.896 --> 20:48.290
and he hasn't checked in to his
NOPD shift supervisor either.

20:48.334 --> 20:49.639
We got to find them.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.032
First, we need to get Mateo
out of detention.

20:51.075 --> 20:53.208
I'm already calling Pride.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.080
I can't transfer custody of any
detainees without authorization

20:56.124 --> 20:57.908
from the Office of the Principal
Legal Advisor.

20:57.952 --> 20:59.736
Well, I can't get
that authorization

20:59.780 --> 21:02.565
without a criminal informant
agreement from his NOPD handler

21:02.609 --> 21:04.741
who, at the moment, is MIA.

21:04.785 --> 21:06.265
Then my hands are tied.
I'm sorry.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.397
Mateo Diaz has got
a target on his back.

21:08.441 --> 21:11.922
The Aztec Kings will take him
out the first chance they get.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.184
Which is why we have him
in segregated custody,

21:13.228 --> 21:14.751
per your request.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.666
No other detainees
can get to him in here.

21:16.710 --> 21:19.713
I'm sorry, I just need
to check it out for myself.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.241
Here you go.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.592
Now you'll see Mateo
is perfectly safe and sound.

21:31.159 --> 21:33.466
That's not Mateo Diaz.

21:35.816 --> 21:38.297
SEBASTIAN: Wait, how did
they lose a human being?

21:38.340 --> 21:40.255
According to Pride,
the administrator claims

21:40.299 --> 21:42.083
it was an accident.No. No way.

21:42.126 --> 21:45.304
The Aztec Kings must've had
a-a guard working on the inside.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.306
Well, either way, Mateo's
in general population now.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.960
It's only a matter of time
before the gang gets to him.

21:50.004 --> 21:52.789
There are a thousand detainees
in that facility.

21:52.833 --> 21:55.009
And when Pride finds him, we
need to help him get Mateo out.

21:55.052 --> 21:58.447
That's gonna be another problem.
Just got back from NOPD.

21:58.491 --> 21:59.796
Still no sign of Carter?Nope. And whatever agreement

21:59.840 --> 22:02.233
Carter and Mateo had
doesn't seem to exist.

22:02.277 --> 22:03.844
HANNAH: Well, there must be
an official C.I. record.

22:03.887 --> 22:05.454
It's NOPD protocol.

22:05.498 --> 22:09.371
Only thing Carter filed on Mateo
was pending felony charges.

22:09.415 --> 22:12.069
Okay, I am not liking this guy.

22:12.113 --> 22:14.333
You and me both.Carter is credited

22:14.376 --> 22:16.857
with at least two dozen Aztec
King arrests because of Mateo.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.467
Why would they keep it hidden?

22:18.511 --> 22:20.339
It's not the arrests
he's interested in.

22:20.382 --> 22:22.341
Take a look at the Aztec King
cases he made.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.214
SEBASTIAN: These are all
felonies that got

22:26.257 --> 22:27.694
kicked down
to misdemeanors.

22:27.737 --> 22:29.696
Most of these guys
did-did minimal time.

22:29.739 --> 22:31.915
'Cause the evidence
keeps getting misplaced.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.656
Cash, drugs, guns.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.354
The whole kit and
caboodle, all gone.

22:35.397 --> 22:36.833
Tens of thousands worth.

22:36.877 --> 22:38.835
So Carter's been
busting the Aztec Kings

22:38.879 --> 22:41.011
but then keeping everything
valuable for himself?

22:41.055 --> 22:42.186
HANNAH: These arrests are
a dog and pony show.

22:42.230 --> 22:43.666
The longer the Kings
stay in business,

22:43.710 --> 22:45.364
the richer Carter gets.

22:45.407 --> 22:47.931
Yeah. He never had any intention
of shutting them down.

22:47.975 --> 22:49.846
And Mateo's about
to pay the price.

22:49.890 --> 22:51.413
SEBASTIAN:
Wait a minute.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.720
Look at the markings
on that knife.

22:53.763 --> 22:56.940
It's the same one that was used
to stab Sergeant Dunn.

22:56.984 --> 22:59.769
Yeah, which was stolen out of
the evidence locker a week ago.

22:59.813 --> 23:01.510
And the original owner
is still in the Parish jail.

23:01.554 --> 23:03.251
Why would Carter kill
Sergeant Dunn

23:03.294 --> 23:04.992
and make it look
like the Kings did it?

23:05.035 --> 23:06.428
She must have figured out
that he was dirty,

23:06.472 --> 23:08.299
threatened to turn him in.This guy's

23:08.343 --> 23:10.650
a disgrace to the badge. I'm
gonna take him down personally.

23:10.693 --> 23:12.042
Right there with you,
Christopher. Let's get a BOLO

23:12.086 --> 23:14.654
out on this guy.BOLO won't be necessary.

23:14.697 --> 23:16.656
Wade just found Carter.

23:21.530 --> 23:24.968
Jefferson Parish sheriffs found
him dumped in the park.

23:25.012 --> 23:26.448
He was stripped naked.

23:26.492 --> 23:27.623
Displayed for everyone to see.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.059
Yes, and the
knife wounds

23:29.103 --> 23:30.583
are consistent
with the style of blade

23:30.626 --> 23:33.455
that killed Sergeant Dunn.

23:33.499 --> 23:35.457
Except this time,
it really was the Aztec Kings.

23:35.501 --> 23:38.329
Gang justice served
at its worst.

23:38.373 --> 23:42.769
If Pride doesn't find Mateo
soon, he'll be next.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.106
Guard, I need your help.

24:16.150 --> 24:17.804
I'm in danger.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.460
They're going to kill me.

24:22.591 --> 24:23.984
No.

24:25.333 --> 24:28.467
Where are you going?
Please, wait.

24:32.993 --> 24:35.648
Drop it!
DARCY: Up against
the wall now, guys.

24:46.180 --> 24:48.182
It's okay, Mateo.

24:48.225 --> 24:50.097
I got you.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.707
All right?

24:51.751 --> 24:53.796
All right? You're safe.

25:05.634 --> 25:07.723
Pride got to Mateo just in time.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.290
Aztec Kings were about
to take him out.

25:09.333 --> 25:10.509
He's in Pride's custody now.

25:10.552 --> 25:11.988
Well, where is Pride
taking him?

25:12.032 --> 25:13.947
He didn't get specific.
Somewhere off the grid.

25:13.990 --> 25:16.558
Smart move considering Carter
was dirty and at least one guard

25:16.602 --> 25:18.604
was on the Aztec Kings' payroll.

25:18.647 --> 25:20.170
So he's with Mateo all alone?

25:20.214 --> 25:21.694
No. His brother's with him.Why Jimmy?

25:21.737 --> 25:23.347
Mateo was rattled
after the attack.

25:23.391 --> 25:25.567
Pride thought it would give him
comfort to see a familiar face.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.090
Well, none of them are safe
until we get Leo Reyes

25:27.134 --> 25:28.396
and his crew in cuffs.

25:28.439 --> 25:30.354
Start with the crooked
detention center guard.

25:30.398 --> 25:33.314
Milton Gordon. Lasalle's
bringing him in now.

25:33.357 --> 25:35.359
Hey, maybe he could
lead us to Reyes.

25:35.403 --> 25:37.448
We won't give him a choice.

25:41.496 --> 25:44.194
PRIDE: Thompson,
I'm sorry about yesterday.

25:44.238 --> 25:47.023
Do you have any idea
how hard it was explaining

25:47.067 --> 25:50.940
to our very important guests
why you never came back?

25:50.984 --> 25:54.030
I'm sure you found an artful
and diplomatic way to do it.

25:54.074 --> 25:56.032
Did my best assuring them
you'd be here today

25:56.076 --> 25:57.556
for their presentation.

25:57.599 --> 26:00.689
Uh, yeah. A-About that...

26:00.733 --> 26:03.213
Please tell me you're not still
micromanaging this gang case.

26:03.257 --> 26:06.521
What I'm doing
is protecting a witness

26:06.565 --> 26:08.828
who's trying to stand up
against all odds.

26:08.871 --> 26:10.394
Assuming this is the detainee
you removed

26:10.438 --> 26:12.396
from an ICE center
without authorization?

26:12.440 --> 26:13.702
You heard about that, huh?

26:13.746 --> 26:15.965
All morning long, Pride.

26:16.009 --> 26:18.054
You're gonna hear about it, too.

26:18.098 --> 26:20.796
He needed to be removed
from the situation ASAP.

26:20.840 --> 26:25.235
You have 50 special agents
at your disposal to get it done.

26:25.279 --> 26:26.628
Why do you need to be the one

26:26.672 --> 26:28.587
to personally save him

26:28.630 --> 26:30.240
Considering I'm covering
your ass with mine,

26:30.284 --> 26:31.677
I think I deserve it.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.070
Pretty sure
he's one of the reasons

26:34.114 --> 26:36.246
I came back from the dead.

26:38.727 --> 26:40.599
Okay. Next time, lie to me.

26:40.642 --> 26:45.995
Deal. If you promise to make
things right with the OPLA,

26:46.039 --> 26:48.345
get Mateo
in my official custody.

26:48.389 --> 26:50.826
Perfect. Now all I have to do

26:50.870 --> 26:53.786
is find an artful and diplomatic
way to get it done.

26:53.829 --> 26:55.439
Thank you, Steven.

26:55.483 --> 26:57.267
Oh, don't thank me yet.

26:57.311 --> 27:00.662
Hush puppies, catfish
and boudin.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.925
All essential
food groups covered.

27:02.969 --> 27:05.101
Yes, please. I am starving.

27:05.145 --> 27:07.103
Here you go, Mateo.No, thank you.

27:07.147 --> 27:08.627
I am not hungry.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.324
Have a few bites at least.

27:10.367 --> 27:11.630
You haven't eaten
since yesterday, son.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.936
I'm not your son.JIMMY: Hey, kid.

27:13.980 --> 27:15.459
Dwayne's on your side here.

27:15.503 --> 27:17.636
No, no, come on.
It's okay, Jimmy.

27:17.679 --> 27:20.639
Look, he's been acting
more like an adult

27:20.682 --> 27:22.466
than most of the adults
around him.

27:22.510 --> 27:25.644
You're no one's
son or kid now.

27:25.687 --> 27:28.168
I get it. But we're still gonna
help you, though.

27:28.211 --> 27:30.779
That I promise.

27:30.823 --> 27:33.782
Sergeant Dunn said
the same thing.

27:33.826 --> 27:35.479
So did Officer Carter.

27:35.523 --> 27:37.220
You see where
it got them?

27:37.264 --> 27:39.353
Well, Officer Carter played you.

27:39.396 --> 27:41.007
He played Dunn, too.

27:41.050 --> 27:43.009
But we got your back.

27:43.052 --> 27:44.706
No one's gonna touch you now.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.708
You and who else
has got my back?

27:46.752 --> 27:49.363
Well, the two of us, Mateo.
For now.

27:49.406 --> 27:52.366
I am not safe in detention.

27:52.409 --> 27:54.673
I'm not safe with the NOPD.

27:54.716 --> 27:57.588
But somehow, I am safe
with the two of you?

27:57.632 --> 27:59.460
Dwayne happens
to be bulletproof.

28:02.158 --> 28:04.595
Bit of an exaggeration,
but, uh...

28:05.988 --> 28:07.424
Come on.

28:19.785 --> 28:21.177
Where exactly are you taking me?

28:21.221 --> 28:24.485
Oh, someplace real special.

28:24.528 --> 28:26.748
You're gonna love it.

28:26.792 --> 28:30.186
LASALLE: Everyone deserves
the benefit of the doubt,

28:30.230 --> 28:32.406
with a few key exceptions.

28:32.449 --> 28:35.061
Crooked cops are
on the top of the list.

28:35.104 --> 28:38.107
Hey. I didn't hear the
kid calling for help.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.456
It was an honest mistake.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.154
Just like it was
an honest mistake

28:41.197 --> 28:42.895
switching Mateo's file
with another detainee's?

28:42.938 --> 28:45.724
You can't prove I did that.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.551
Don't have to.

28:47.595 --> 28:49.205
You'll never see a judge.

28:49.249 --> 28:50.598
'Cause when the Aztec Kings

28:50.641 --> 28:52.382
hear you ratted
them out,

28:52.426 --> 28:53.732
they'll take care of you.

28:55.559 --> 28:57.823
Man, I haven't said a word.

28:57.866 --> 29:01.261
Try convincing Leo Reyes.

29:01.304 --> 29:05.134
He seems, uh,
like the reasonable type.

29:08.442 --> 29:10.618
Look,

29:10.661 --> 29:13.577
if I help you,
you're gonna protect me, right?

29:13.621 --> 29:15.188
Depends on what you got to say.

29:15.231 --> 29:18.408
Look, I was just trying
to make ends meet.

29:18.452 --> 29:20.280
Keep food on the table.

29:20.323 --> 29:22.935
You live alone in a two-room
apartment off the highway.

29:22.978 --> 29:24.806
What ends do you got to meet?

29:24.850 --> 29:27.853
It's just a few extra bucks
to look the other way.

29:27.896 --> 29:29.855
Let those scumbags handle
their business.

29:29.898 --> 29:31.595
You're really testing
my charity here.

29:31.639 --> 29:34.250
All I'm saying is we don't get
involved in their violence.

29:35.469 --> 29:37.776
What do you mean "we"?

29:40.517 --> 29:43.129
Ladies,
Gordon isn't the only guard

29:43.172 --> 29:44.870
in the Aztecs' pocket.

29:44.913 --> 29:46.872
Shift supervisor Roland Webb

29:46.915 --> 29:49.875
followed Pride and Mateo when
they left the detention center.

29:49.918 --> 29:52.486
Reyes may already know
where they are.We have to warn Pride.

29:52.529 --> 29:53.966
Hey, phone goes
straight to voice mail.

29:54.009 --> 29:56.055
Can't locate him
on cell towers, either.

29:56.098 --> 29:57.621
Wherever he's taking Mateo,
it's got to be in the middle

29:57.665 --> 29:58.840
of nowhere.Well, how do we find them?

29:58.884 --> 30:00.973
Social media.

30:01.016 --> 30:02.757
If the Aztec Kings
are going after Mateo,

30:02.801 --> 30:04.063
that's how
they'll spread the word.

30:04.106 --> 30:05.716
I just hope we can
crack the code.

30:27.869 --> 30:31.264
Exactly how I remember it.

30:31.307 --> 30:32.874
Looks like the
house in the movie

30:32.918 --> 30:35.137
with the chainsaw killer
hiding in the basement.

30:35.181 --> 30:36.965
Ah, don't worry,
no basements in New Orleans.

30:37.009 --> 30:38.706
What is this place?

30:38.749 --> 30:40.708
Our pop's old fishing cabin.

30:40.751 --> 30:43.015
Cassius never went fishing
a day in his life.

30:43.058 --> 30:45.365
If he came out here,

30:45.408 --> 30:46.888
it was to lay low
from the cops.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.020
Ah, he went fishing
with me, Dwayne.

30:49.456 --> 30:52.067
Bass, catfish, bowfin.

30:53.895 --> 30:55.810
But that's ancient history
though, right?

30:57.290 --> 30:58.813
Important thing is, we're safe.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.728
Completely isolated out here.

31:00.771 --> 31:03.470
Yeah, maybe too isolated.

31:03.513 --> 31:06.299
There's no cell signal.

31:06.342 --> 31:07.866
I need to check in
with my team.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.258
There used to be
a landline here.

31:09.302 --> 31:11.173
Just got to find
the phone. Come on.

31:13.567 --> 31:15.177
Hold up.

31:16.265 --> 31:17.527
You guys are brothers?

31:17.571 --> 31:19.703
Half.
Half.

31:28.060 --> 31:30.018
I know it's here somewhere.

31:33.065 --> 31:35.937
Damn. Wow.

31:35.981 --> 31:37.896
This thing is vintage.

31:37.939 --> 31:39.593
Gift from the old man.

31:39.636 --> 31:42.117
My, um, for my ninth birthday.

31:42.161 --> 31:43.727
Man, I loved that bike.

31:43.771 --> 31:46.469
That's my bike.

31:46.513 --> 31:48.558
Cassius said it was stolen
out of our front yard.

31:48.602 --> 31:50.386
Gave me hell
for not locking it up.

31:50.430 --> 31:52.214
You want it back?

31:52.258 --> 31:55.348
MATEO: I could
restore it for you.

31:55.391 --> 31:56.740
Make it better than new.

31:56.784 --> 31:59.178
Tell you what, you want
to restore that bike?

31:59.221 --> 32:01.354
It's yours.

32:03.443 --> 32:05.967
Awesome.

32:06.011 --> 32:08.361
Thank you.Oh, the fireplace.

32:16.282 --> 32:18.197
Aha.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.894
Yes.

32:23.245 --> 32:25.204
Ah, still works.

32:25.247 --> 32:26.596
Must be our lucky day.

32:29.077 --> 32:31.819
Hey. You hear something?

32:35.040 --> 32:36.476
Get down!

33:00.804 --> 33:02.197
How the hell'd they find us?

33:02.241 --> 33:04.069
I knew Leo would
never let me go.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.943
Listen to me, Jimmy.
Take Mateo out the back.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.466
The highway's got to
be, like, a half mile.

33:10.510 --> 33:12.120
Straight through
the woods.
What about you?

33:12.164 --> 33:13.382
I'm gonna stay here;
I'll buy us some time.

33:13.426 --> 33:14.905
No, no, no, no,
I'm not leaving you behind.

33:14.949 --> 33:16.777
It's not a request, Jimmy.Sorry, bro. No can do.

33:16.820 --> 33:19.606
You want to take a stand,
we take a stand together.Jimmy, please.

33:19.649 --> 33:21.129
This isn't about you and me.

33:21.173 --> 33:22.652
This is about saving the life

33:22.696 --> 33:23.958
of a 17-year-old kid.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.264
Plus, I'm bulletproof, remember?

33:27.092 --> 33:29.224
All right, come on.
Go ahead, Mateo.

33:29.268 --> 33:30.660
Don't stop or look back
till you get to the highway.

33:30.704 --> 33:32.053
Dwayne...

33:32.097 --> 33:33.881
Go!

33:36.144 --> 33:38.059
Sebastian, where
are you sending us?

33:38.103 --> 33:40.409
Ascension Parish. I think.HANNAH: Okay, well,

33:40.453 --> 33:42.368
it's 300 square miles; can you
be a little more specific?

33:42.411 --> 33:44.892
Well, it's not exactly easy
breaking the Aztec Kings' code

33:44.935 --> 33:46.676
when I know that
Pride's life's on the line.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.113
GREGORIO:
Sebastian, you got this.

33:48.156 --> 33:49.810
We all know it,
we just need you to get

33:49.853 --> 33:51.072
much faster than you are.

33:51.116 --> 33:52.726
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

33:52.769 --> 33:53.988
Here, here we go.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.034
Uh, Highway 44
towards the river.

33:56.077 --> 33:57.209
I can guide you in from there.

34:05.130 --> 34:07.001
Leave him!
Get inside the cabin!

34:07.045 --> 34:08.829
Come on, Mateo.

34:08.872 --> 34:10.135
You got to run faster.

34:10.178 --> 34:11.919
I thought you were trying
to be a Marine.

34:13.964 --> 34:16.141
Oh, I twisted my ankle.

34:16.184 --> 34:17.359
Oh, it hurts really bad.

34:17.403 --> 34:19.492
Okay, all right. New plan.

34:19.535 --> 34:22.060
I'm gonna find you
a place to hide.

34:47.694 --> 34:50.044
You stay here.
You hide.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.132
You stay quiet.

34:51.176 --> 34:53.265
All right? Quiet.Okay.

35:18.725 --> 35:20.466
MATEO:
Leo.

35:20.509 --> 35:22.511
You want me dead?

35:22.555 --> 35:23.904
Here I am.

35:28.082 --> 35:31.041
What part of "stay hidden and
quiet" didn't you understand?

35:35.872 --> 35:38.701
I warned you, Teo.

35:38.745 --> 35:41.487
I told you the penalty
for betraying your family.

35:41.530 --> 35:43.489
You're not my family, Leo.

35:44.533 --> 35:46.144
Not anymore.

35:53.847 --> 35:56.806
You're not gonna
pull the trigger.

36:02.812 --> 36:05.641
I didn't think you had the guts.

36:05.685 --> 36:07.295
PRIDE:
Wasn't Mateo.

36:07.339 --> 36:08.601
It was me.

36:11.821 --> 36:13.736
Drop the knife.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.173
I will take you out.

36:22.615 --> 36:25.574
HANNAH:
Federal agents!

36:25.618 --> 36:27.750
LASALLE: Pride, you all right?PRIDE: I am now.

36:27.794 --> 36:30.057
GREGORIO: Put your hands
on your head. Now!

36:30.100 --> 36:31.754
Move.

36:31.798 --> 36:33.713
Come here.

36:36.455 --> 36:37.978
GREGORIO:
Get up. Get up!

36:39.762 --> 36:41.242
Get up.

36:45.246 --> 36:48.206
It's over, Mateo.

36:48.249 --> 36:50.338
You're safe.

36:52.384 --> 36:54.603
Thank you.Come on.

37:03.830 --> 37:05.266
Just got off a
conference call

37:05.310 --> 37:07.616
with USCIS and the
U.S. Attorney's Office.

37:07.660 --> 37:11.359
Are they going to amend
Mateo's asylum status?

37:11.403 --> 37:12.578
Even better.

37:12.621 --> 37:14.580
They're wiping his record.

37:14.623 --> 37:17.452
And fast-tracking his
lawful permanent
resident's application.

37:17.496 --> 37:18.888
Okay, so he can
start fresh.

37:18.932 --> 37:20.368
Find the better life

37:20.412 --> 37:21.978
he came here for.

37:22.022 --> 37:23.110
Thank you.

37:23.153 --> 37:25.939
Just following
my SAC's orders.

37:25.982 --> 37:28.289
No matter how
unusual they were.

37:29.769 --> 37:30.944
Hey.

37:30.987 --> 37:32.859
Just between us.

37:34.513 --> 37:36.166
Kind of feels good, doesn't it?

37:36.210 --> 37:38.908
Bending rules
for the right reasons?

37:38.952 --> 37:41.737
Uh, excuse me,
Special Agent Pride,

37:41.781 --> 37:43.565
but I followed
exacting procedure

37:43.609 --> 37:45.263
to get Mateo's status adjusted.

37:46.612 --> 37:48.353
Hardly a bent rule to be found.

37:48.396 --> 37:49.876
Fair enough.

37:51.530 --> 37:54.359
And our visitors from the DoD?

37:54.402 --> 37:57.884
Oh, you're gonna want to
thank me for that, too.

37:57.927 --> 38:01.061
I extended their
stay an extra day.

38:01.104 --> 38:02.889
They'll be presenting to you
in the morning.

38:03.977 --> 38:05.413
8:00 a.m.

38:06.588 --> 38:09.025
8:00 That's...

38:09.069 --> 38:10.200
Sharp.

38:10.244 --> 38:11.593
I'll be there.

38:21.168 --> 38:23.039
Aluminum foil will get the rust
right off the frame.

38:23.083 --> 38:24.693
I have an old stem I can use.

38:24.737 --> 38:28.523
Tires... maybe some
upgraded sprockets

38:28.567 --> 38:30.699
and a customized bottom bracket.

38:30.743 --> 38:32.310
I have no idea what
you just said.

38:32.353 --> 38:35.530
But it all sounded
like gravy to me.

38:35.574 --> 38:37.532
Let's get started on
this bike tomorrow.

38:37.576 --> 38:39.969
Maybe.

38:40.013 --> 38:41.884
But I don't know
where I'll be tomorrow.

38:43.930 --> 38:46.411
New city, new school.

38:47.499 --> 38:48.935
I'm becoming a whole new person.

38:48.978 --> 38:50.893
No, no, you're still
the same person.

38:50.937 --> 38:52.939
You're just getting
a second chance

38:52.982 --> 38:56.072
to show the world
what you're made of.

38:56.116 --> 38:57.683
And trust me, that's
the best gift...

38:57.726 --> 39:00.686
that's the best
gift there is.

39:00.729 --> 39:05.038
Mateo, I want you to meet my
very dear friend, Dr. Wade.

39:05.081 --> 39:06.213
Loretta.MATEO: Hello.

39:06.256 --> 39:08.389
Nice to meet you,
ma'am.
Mm-hmm.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.609
Loretta has two great sons,
Danny and CJ.

39:10.652 --> 39:13.394
My boys are originally
from Hollygrove.

39:13.438 --> 39:15.614
We became a family
a few years back.

39:15.657 --> 39:18.268
Like adopted?That's right.

39:18.312 --> 39:21.054
And I know a few
wonderful foster families

39:21.097 --> 39:24.013
who would be eager to
meet someone like you.

39:24.057 --> 39:25.580
Really?
Mm-hmm.

39:25.624 --> 39:28.409
Ah, let's go have a
chat in the kitchen,

39:28.453 --> 39:29.976
help me cut up
these vegetables.

39:33.022 --> 39:36.025
You did
good today, Dwayne.

39:37.766 --> 39:39.289
We did good.

39:40.334 --> 39:42.205
That we did.

39:43.250 --> 39:45.426
Though next time,

39:45.470 --> 39:46.862
you might want to arrive

39:46.906 --> 39:48.821
a couple of minutes before
I get my ass kicked.

39:50.649 --> 39:52.781
Well, I certainly
will consider it.

39:52.825 --> 39:54.653
I'm just saying.
Yeah.
