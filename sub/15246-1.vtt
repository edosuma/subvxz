01:04.724 --> 01:07.311
- Upstairs!
- What's going on?

01:07.436 --> 01:08.479
Who are you?

01:10.397 --> 01:12.608
Dade! Dade!

01:13.567 --> 01:14.651
Knock it down.

01:16.612 --> 01:18.947
The defendant, Dade Murphy,

01:19.281 --> 01:22.910
who calls himself 'Zero Cool',

01:23.035 --> 01:27.915
has repeatedly committed criminal acts
of a malicious nature.

01:28.040 --> 01:32.461
This defendant possesses
a superior intelligence,

01:32.586 --> 01:37.049
which he uses to a destructive
and antisocial end.

01:38.467 --> 01:46.600
His computer virus crashed 1507 systems,
including Wall Street trading systems,

01:46.725 --> 01:51.814
single-handedly causing a seven-point
drop in the New York stock market.

01:52.523 --> 01:57.277
Dade Murphy, I hereby fine
your family $45,000.

01:58.237 --> 02:02.658
I sentence you to probation.
You are forbidden to use a computer

02:02.783 --> 02:06.954
or a touchtone telephone until
the day of your 18th birthday.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.108
- Dade?
- Yeah, Mom?

04:41.316 --> 04:42.860
What are you doing?

04:44.820 --> 04:47.406
Taking over a TV network.

04:47.948 --> 04:52.119
Finish up, honey. Go to sleep.
And happy birthday.

04:59.376 --> 05:00.961
Security, Norm...

05:01.086 --> 05:02.046
Norman speaking.

05:02.171 --> 05:05.340
Norman. This is Mr Eddie Vedder
from Accounting.

05:05.466 --> 05:09.470
I had a power surge here at home
that wiped out a file I was working on.

05:10.429 --> 05:13.390
I'm in big trouble.
You know anything about computers?

05:14.892 --> 05:16.060
Gee...

05:16.185 --> 05:20.856
My BLT drive on my computer
just went AWOL,

05:20.981 --> 05:25.319
and I have this big project
due tomorrow for Mr Kawasaki.

05:25.444 --> 05:27.654
If I screw up, he'll make me
commit hari-kari.

05:29.907 --> 05:32.868
You know these Japanese
management techniques.

05:33.869 --> 05:36.372
Could you read me
the number on the modem?

05:38.290 --> 05:40.793
It's a little boxy thing
with switches on it.

05:40.918 --> 05:42.920
It lets my computer
talk to the one there.

05:43.003 --> 05:43.879
212...

05:44.004 --> 05:48.550
5554240.

06:11.115 --> 06:16.912
So-called American Indians, Latinos,
and blacks are genetically mediocre.

06:17.037 --> 06:18.831
Yak, yak, yak.

06:19.915 --> 06:20.999
Get a job.

06:54.408 --> 06:57.536
You are about to experience
the awe and mystery

06:57.661 --> 06:59.163
which reaches from
the inner mind

06:59.288 --> 07:02.624
to... The Outer Limits.

07:13.635 --> 07:15.345
Zero...

07:16.805 --> 07:17.681
No, wait.

07:30.277 --> 07:30.986
Unbelievable.

07:31.195 --> 07:32.696
A hacker.

07:39.244 --> 07:42.748
Yeah, okay, Acid Burn. That's enough.

08:28.919 --> 08:31.046
Shit on me!

08:36.719 --> 08:40.013
Good morning.
Did you unpack your stuff yet?

08:42.140 --> 08:43.892
Up all night again?

08:44.268 --> 08:47.104
Can this wait until both
of my eyes are open?

08:50.190 --> 08:53.986
Can I cut the electricity to his room
so he'll get some sleep?

08:54.111 --> 08:57.781
He's been playing with his computer
all night for a week.

08:58.574 --> 09:00.576
Yes, he could be playing with himself.

09:02.161 --> 09:04.621
Yes, I'll ask. Dade,

09:05.456 --> 09:07.166
you like girls, don't you?

09:07.291 --> 09:10.335
Yeah. I just haven't found one
as charming as you.

09:12.337 --> 09:14.173
You haven't done anything stupid, right?

09:15.257 --> 09:16.800
Right, Dade?

09:16.967 --> 09:18.093
Right, Mom.

09:18.469 --> 09:20.137
And I'm still a virgin.

09:35.819 --> 09:38.364
You hooked it up to the phone,
didn't you?

09:38.822 --> 09:41.825
Dade, turn the shower off!

09:44.078 --> 09:47.414
You screw up again
and you won't get into college.

10:00.260 --> 10:02.721
I'm sorry we had to move
in your senior year.

10:02.846 --> 10:06.642
I didn't want to sell the house
but I had to take this job. You know that.

10:08.143 --> 10:10.729
You'll love New York.
It's the city that never sleeps.

10:48.434 --> 10:52.104
I miss you, too, baby.
Claro que sí.

10:53.313 --> 10:54.815
Excuse me.

10:55.315 --> 10:57.234
Chill, man. I'm talking to Venezuela.

10:57.359 --> 10:59.737
I'm sorry. Where's the principal's office?

10:59.862 --> 11:01.280
I can't help you, kid.

11:15.878 --> 11:17.254
Do you have your transfer forms?

11:19.673 --> 11:22.301
It's a straightforward question.

11:28.265 --> 11:29.641
Do you speak English?

11:29.892 --> 11:32.227
Sorry, you wanted...

11:32.352 --> 11:33.854
Transfer forms.

11:43.489 --> 11:44.907
Are you coming?

11:57.336 --> 12:01.256
The gym is through there
and the cafeteria is through there.

12:01.799 --> 12:03.842
Great. Cool.

12:07.388 --> 12:08.847
What's your name?

12:09.056 --> 12:11.266
Kate. Kate Libby.

12:12.059 --> 12:13.519
Here's your class.

12:13.852 --> 12:16.605
My class.
I'm not in your class?

12:17.398 --> 12:19.274
No, you're not in my class.

12:22.569 --> 12:24.113
Give me time.

12:24.196 --> 12:25.781
- You new?
- Yeah.

12:26.532 --> 12:28.075
Tell him about the pool, Kate.

12:29.326 --> 12:30.244
Pool?

12:30.369 --> 12:33.997
There's an Olympic-size
swimming pool on the roof.

12:34.790 --> 12:36.583
Take the stairs over there.

12:37.626 --> 12:40.003
Yeah. Sure.

12:42.047 --> 12:43.465
Thanks.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.471
Hey! Hold the door!

12:54.643 --> 12:55.728
No pool.

13:29.970 --> 13:32.222
Oh, my God. He found the pool.

13:36.727 --> 13:38.103
I'm Mr Simpson.

13:38.228 --> 13:42.274
I'm subbing for Ms Bayless,
who was arrested at the anti-fur rally.

13:45.027 --> 13:50.783
I know some ofyou kids got computers
at home, but these are school property.

13:56.955 --> 14:00.793
Chapter One.
'Designing Graphical Interface'.

14:07.174 --> 14:09.676
What's your interest in Kate Libby?

14:09.802 --> 14:11.720
Academic, purely sexual?

14:11.929 --> 14:13.555
Homicidal.

14:14.223 --> 14:17.142
What's up, man? I'm the Phreak.

14:17.893 --> 14:20.854
The Fantom Phreak?
The King of Nynex?

14:23.107 --> 14:24.858
I know you play the game.

14:25.192 --> 14:27.653
Phreak, Phreak, Phreak.
Dude, dude, dude.

14:27.861 --> 14:31.448
Joey! One more 'dude'
and I'll slap the shit out of you.

14:32.116 --> 14:36.245
You gotta stop letting your mama
dress you, man. You're hopeless!

14:37.913 --> 14:40.290
- Check it.
- I need a handle.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.378
I don't have an identity
until I have a handle.

14:44.503 --> 14:47.756
You're right about that.
Check it. Friday.

14:52.845 --> 14:54.847
Wait. How about The Master of Disaster?

14:54.972 --> 14:57.182
You're utterly hopeless, man.

14:57.307 --> 14:59.727
Ultra Laser... Doctor Doom!

15:16.326 --> 15:19.204
Tell me what you need. Records?
Tapes? Any kind offormat or disk.

15:19.329 --> 15:22.958
Check this out, each of you.
Compilation tapes of my own making.

15:23.083 --> 15:25.085
I call this 'The Greatest Zukes Album',

15:25.210 --> 15:30.632
featuring Hendrix, Joplin,
Mama Cass, Belushi,

15:30.758 --> 15:35.012
all great artists who asphyxiated
on their own vomit!

15:35.888 --> 15:37.723
You can't get this in stores!

15:48.567 --> 15:51.403
Please deposit $5
for the first minute.

15:53.697 --> 15:54.615
Thank you.

15:54.740 --> 15:56.158
No, thank you.

16:26.688 --> 16:29.108
That's a nice score for a girl.

16:31.735 --> 16:33.529
Think you can do better?

16:35.072 --> 16:36.699
I'll give it a shot.

16:51.630 --> 16:53.674
Is this kid bothering you, Kate?

16:54.591 --> 16:56.552
Could I get some room here?

16:57.428 --> 16:59.179
Why don't you come up here?

17:37.676 --> 17:38.802
He's good!

17:49.521 --> 17:51.940
Well, it looks like I'm on top.

17:56.028 --> 17:59.448
Congratulations.
No-one's ever beat her before.

17:59.698 --> 18:01.575
You just made an enemy for life.

18:04.203 --> 18:06.538
Boy meets world. Let's go.

18:25.682 --> 18:27.768
- Who's that?
- Curtis.

18:29.311 --> 18:30.479
What's he do?

18:30.604 --> 18:33.482
You're looking at it.
He looks slick all day.

18:36.151 --> 18:37.069
Joey!

19:17.109 --> 19:18.444
What's up?

19:24.616 --> 19:27.745
Oh, my God! You...?

19:39.631 --> 19:41.258
Way cool!

19:42.968 --> 19:44.344
You saw that?

19:44.762 --> 19:46.138
What the hell is going on?

19:46.555 --> 19:48.474
Pool on the roof must be leaking.

19:58.567 --> 20:00.611
Oh, man. This is going to be good.

20:08.494 --> 20:11.038
'God gave men brains larger than dogs

20:11.163 --> 20:14.124
so they wouldn't hump women's legs
at cocktail parties'.

20:14.750 --> 20:15.709
Ruth Libby.

20:17.378 --> 20:21.173
I'm not sure your mother qualifies
as a significant 20th century author.

20:21.298 --> 20:23.967
Her last book sold 2 million copies.

20:28.472 --> 20:33.060
'Angelheaded hipsters burning for
the ancient heavenly connection

20:33.185 --> 20:37.022
'to the starry dynamo
in the machinery of the night'.

20:37.147 --> 20:38.273
Ginsberg.

20:40.192 --> 20:41.819
Nice. Very nice.

20:43.696 --> 20:45.739
He's not in this class.

20:46.198 --> 20:47.408
I said give me time.

20:48.742 --> 20:51.578
He's not enrolled in this class.

20:51.870 --> 20:53.831
Well, he's on my list.

21:06.719 --> 21:11.140
'Of all the things I've lost,
I miss my mind the most'.

21:11.390 --> 21:12.975
Ozzy Osbourne.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.728
You. What is your name?

21:16.603 --> 21:18.397
Emmanuel Goldstein, sir.

21:19.148 --> 21:22.317
You, however, are not on my list.

21:23.610 --> 21:25.863
This isn't wood shop class?

21:30.784 --> 21:33.454
Class crashing. Come on.

21:33.579 --> 21:34.997
Now get out.

21:36.790 --> 21:38.500
Thank you, sir.

21:45.340 --> 21:46.800
How was school?

21:49.970 --> 21:52.264
- What did we learn in school today?
- Revenge.

21:52.431 --> 21:55.100
Ahh. Did we meet someone special?

21:55.517 --> 21:57.102
No. No-one special.

21:58.896 --> 22:03.067
I have to get back to work.
Would you please try to fill these out?

22:04.109 --> 22:05.069
Don't worry,

22:05.194 --> 22:07.154
it's only the rest of your life.

22:08.655 --> 22:12.409
Anything else?
Want me to mow the lawn?

22:12.534 --> 22:15.079
Oops, I forgot. New York, no grass.

22:15.954 --> 22:17.164
And unpack.

22:41.271 --> 22:44.817
You can sit at home
and do absolutely nothing

22:45.609 --> 22:48.028
and your name goes through
17 computers a day.

22:48.153 --> 22:51.407
'1984'? Yeah, right. That's a typo.

22:51.532 --> 22:56.704
Orwell's here and living large.
We have no names, man. No names!

22:57.788 --> 22:58.997
Can I score a fry?

23:00.082 --> 23:01.917
Meet Cereal Killer.

23:02.042 --> 23:03.585
As in Fruit Loops.

23:03.669 --> 23:05.504
But he does know things.

23:05.671 --> 23:07.506
Anyway, guys, listen.

23:08.340 --> 23:10.384
I'm in this computer, right?
I'm looking around...

23:10.509 --> 23:12.511
You got those Crayola books?

23:12.636 --> 23:14.513
Yeah, technicolour rainbow.

23:16.140 --> 23:16.932
Green one.

23:17.057 --> 23:19.143
What is that? Let me see?

23:19.268 --> 23:22.521
- What are these?
- International UNIX environments.

23:22.646 --> 23:24.314
Luscious orange.

23:24.440 --> 23:27.943
Computer security criteria...
DOD standards.

23:29.361 --> 23:31.905
The pink-shirt book... guide to IBM PCs.

23:32.031 --> 23:35.367
So-called due to the nasty pink shirt
the guy wears on the cover.

23:35.492 --> 23:37.286
Devil book, the UNIX bible.

23:37.411 --> 23:39.997
- What's that?
- Dragon book, compiler design.

23:41.957 --> 23:43.834
- What's that?
- The Red book.

23:43.959 --> 23:46.295
NSA-trusted networks.

23:46.503 --> 23:50.507
Otherwise known as 'The Ugly Red Book
That Won't Fit On A Shelf'.

23:50.632 --> 23:54.970
Anyway, guys. Come on.
I'm in this computer, right.

23:55.596 --> 24:00.517
I'm looking around, throwing commands.
I don't know what it does or anything.

24:00.642 --> 24:01.810
It's choice.

24:01.935 --> 24:05.856
It's beautiful. Four hours
just messing around in there.

24:05.981 --> 24:08.859
Finally, I figure out...

24:09.026 --> 24:10.652
that it's a bank.

24:11.195 --> 24:15.282
Okay, wait. It's a bank. So, this morning,
I check the paper,

24:15.407 --> 24:20.996
some cash machine in, like, Bumsville,
Idaho, spits out $700 into the street.

24:21.121 --> 24:22.831
- That's kinda cool.
- That was me.

24:22.998 --> 24:25.959
- I did that.
- You did this from your house?

24:27.503 --> 24:29.129
Are you stoned or stupid?

24:29.213 --> 24:33.217
You don't hack a bank from your house!
You get nailed by the FBI.

24:33.342 --> 24:34.718
Are your brains in your ass?

24:34.843 --> 24:36.345
Don't you know anything?

24:36.470 --> 24:39.098
It's universally stupid, man.

24:39.223 --> 24:42.726
I don't know things because you guys
won't tell me anything. Right?

24:42.851 --> 24:44.770
What are the three most used passwords?

24:44.895 --> 24:48.607
'Love', 'Secret' and 'Sex'.

24:48.732 --> 24:51.527
But not in that order, necessarily. Right?

24:51.610 --> 24:56.532
Don't forget 'God'. System operators
love to use 'God'. Male ego.

24:56.824 --> 25:01.704
To be elite, you have to do a righteous
hack, not this accidental shit.

25:02.788 --> 25:06.583
Which means you score
one of those Gibsons, man.

25:06.709 --> 25:10.796
Those supercomputers they use
to do physics and look for oil.

25:10.921 --> 25:13.465
No way, man. Security is too tight.

25:14.508 --> 25:16.552
Maybe. But if I wanted to hack
some heavy metal,

25:16.677 --> 25:20.264
I'd work my way in
through some back door.

25:20.514 --> 25:25.728
Oh, man. Wouldn't you just love
to get one of those Gibsons?

25:26.645 --> 25:28.480
Who ate all of my fries?

25:30.107 --> 25:32.943
- Joey!
- No, I didn't touch your fries.

25:33.777 --> 25:36.697
- Cereal, man. You owe me a pack.
- It was him.

25:37.740 --> 25:39.533
- Lay off that shit, man.
- I'm gonna hit you!

26:39.927 --> 26:44.181
Yes! Home run, home run. Okay, okay.

26:45.849 --> 26:47.518
You and me, Lucy.

26:48.310 --> 26:50.104
We're gonna show them, baby.

26:50.646 --> 26:51.522
Ow!

27:23.178 --> 27:23.804
Mr Belford?

27:24.054 --> 27:27.349
My name is The Plague.

27:27.516 --> 27:30.978
Mr The Plague, something weird
is happening on the net.

27:31.103 --> 27:33.731
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?

27:33.856 --> 27:37.234
One of the Gibsons is working really hard.

27:37.359 --> 27:40.904
We got one person on-line
but with the workload of 10 users.

27:41.030 --> 27:42.448
I think we got a hacker.

27:47.453 --> 27:50.414
Okay, we need proof that we were here.

27:53.834 --> 27:56.170
Yeah. Garbage. Give me Garbage.

28:07.806 --> 28:09.475
Shit.

28:36.335 --> 28:37.586
Never fear,

28:38.587 --> 28:40.130
I is here.

28:41.256 --> 28:46.345
- I located the activity to terminal 23.
- Let's echo 23, see what's up.

29:02.778 --> 29:04.863
God wouldn't be up this late.

29:18.794 --> 29:19.753
Shit!

29:19.878 --> 29:24.299
Get me the switching control centre.
I need to trace this call.

29:31.140 --> 29:33.851
Hold on, Mom. Hold on one second.

29:34.768 --> 29:37.896
- Open the door, Joseph.
- Yeah, okay.

29:39.773 --> 29:40.858
There you go.

29:41.316 --> 29:43.277
Bed. Sleep.

29:44.945 --> 29:45.946
Now!

29:47.823 --> 29:49.199
Sweet dreams, Joseph.

29:53.287 --> 29:54.246
He's gone.

29:54.371 --> 29:55.873
Did you get a trace?

29:56.040 --> 29:57.499
Yeah, we got him.

29:57.875 --> 29:59.001
Good.

30:13.807 --> 30:15.184
Nice place, huh?

30:19.104 --> 30:21.690
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn?

30:21.815 --> 30:25.402
- You know who he is?
- No. Don't know who he is.

30:25.527 --> 30:26.528
Do you?

30:28.947 --> 30:31.784
Nikon! Lord Nikon, this is...

30:31.909 --> 30:33.285
Crash Override.

30:33.410 --> 30:35.788
Never heard of you.
You done anything?

30:35.913 --> 30:36.705
No.

30:38.832 --> 30:40.167
Come on!

30:42.711 --> 30:45.672
What? Your Mom buy you
a 'puter for Christmas?

30:47.716 --> 30:50.803
- Does he know anything?
- Sure. He's elite.

30:52.471 --> 30:53.430
Come in.

30:59.311 --> 31:03.148
- Nikon, can I crash at your place tonight?
- Again?

31:04.817 --> 31:05.734
Yeah, sure.

31:10.489 --> 31:12.616
Hackers penetrate and ravage

31:12.741 --> 31:16.328
public and private computer systems,
infecting them with viruses...

31:16.453 --> 31:18.080
Who are these guys?

31:19.164 --> 31:22.960
Richard Gill.
Hacker enemy number one. Real boner.

31:23.961 --> 31:26.296
Showtime. Showtime!

31:30.426 --> 31:32.219
- What's going on?
- Four,

31:32.344 --> 31:35.514
three, two, one...

31:37.599 --> 31:39.017
Welcome to our show!

31:39.143 --> 31:40.102
Hack the Planet!

31:40.227 --> 31:42.438
Hack the Planet!

31:43.230 --> 31:46.650
For late night hacks, Jolt Cola,
soft drink ofthe elite hacker.

31:46.775 --> 31:49.153
- Who are these guys?
- That's Razor and Blade.

31:50.154 --> 31:51.155
Razor and Blade?

31:51.280 --> 31:53.741
That's right. This is a pay-phone.

31:54.616 --> 31:55.617
Don't ask.

31:56.076 --> 31:59.455
As you can see, this isjust a simple
micro-cassette recorder.

31:59.580 --> 32:03.208
Hook it up to the phone,
and drop in five bucks in quarters.

32:03.333 --> 32:06.754
Record the tone the coins make,
hang up, get your money back.

32:06.879 --> 32:10.299
Never again pay for a service
that would be cheap,

32:10.424 --> 32:12.760
if it weren't run
by profiteering gluttons.

32:12.885 --> 32:16.513
Remember, hacking is more than
just a crime. It's a survival trait.

32:19.141 --> 32:20.976
I'm a real wild child,
I'm a wild one

32:22.811 --> 32:23.896
I'm a wild one

32:25.814 --> 32:29.485
Thank you! Thank you very much!

32:32.446 --> 32:34.698
Joey! Joey! Thank you!

32:35.240 --> 32:36.116
Freeze!

32:36.241 --> 32:37.534
- What?
- Get out of there!

32:37.659 --> 32:38.494
Out!

32:38.911 --> 32:41.580
- Joey!
- Get in there!

32:42.581 --> 32:43.582
Sit down!

32:44.249 --> 32:45.167
Lucy!

32:46.168 --> 32:47.503
Where are you taking her?

32:49.004 --> 32:50.047
Joey!

32:59.098 --> 33:01.225
- How's it going, Ray?
- Looks good, sir.

33:01.350 --> 33:03.185
We got an uncorrupted hard drive.

33:03.519 --> 33:05.270
In English, please.

33:05.521 --> 33:07.356
I didn't protect the President
for ten years

33:07.481 --> 33:09.441
to finish my career
feeling like an idiot.

33:09.525 --> 33:13.529
I'm sorry, sir. He didn't have time
to erase his computer files.

33:13.654 --> 33:17.533
Good. Let's finish up here.
Take him in for interrogation.

33:17.908 --> 33:19.868
Agent Gill, can you spare a moment?

33:20.577 --> 33:22.121
Why, of course, Jennifer.

33:22.454 --> 33:26.208
- Joey!
- How dangerous are hackers?

33:28.001 --> 33:32.339
Hackers penetrate and ravage public
and private computer systems,

33:32.464 --> 33:36.176
infecting them with viruses
and stealing sensitive materials.

33:36.301 --> 33:38.011
These people are terrorists.

33:55.529 --> 33:56.780
Morning, gentlemen.

33:56.947 --> 33:58.323
Please, be seated.

33:59.116 --> 34:02.119
I see we're still dressing
in the dark, Eugene.

34:02.453 --> 34:06.040
Once again, don't call me Eugene.

34:06.206 --> 34:07.666
Our recent intruder

34:07.833 --> 34:13.172
penetrated using a superuser account,
giving him access to our whole system.

34:14.422 --> 34:16.800
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.

34:17.509 --> 34:21.804
Someone didn't bother reading my memo
on commonly used passwords.

34:21.972 --> 34:25.893
As I meticulously pointed out,
the foremost used passwords are...

34:26.060 --> 34:30.981
'Love', 'Sex', 'Secret' and 'God'.

34:31.148 --> 34:34.943
So would Your Holiness
care to change her password?

34:36.152 --> 34:38.989
A hacker planted the virus.

34:39.739 --> 34:41.199
Virus?

34:44.203 --> 34:48.998
Yesterday, the ballast program
for a supertanker training model

34:49.166 --> 34:53.212
mistakenly thought the vessel was empty
and flooded its tanks.

34:53.379 --> 34:55.005
Excuse me?

34:55.797 --> 34:58.634
The little boat flipped over.

34:58.801 --> 35:03.639
A virus planted within the Gibson system
claimed responsibility.

35:03.806 --> 35:04.890
It left a note?

35:09.687 --> 35:14.942
Unless $5 million is transferred
to the following account in 7 days,

35:15.109 --> 35:18.028
I will capsize five tankers
in the Ellingson fleet.

35:18.195 --> 35:20.531
- Is that...?
- That is the virus.

35:20.698 --> 35:22.616
Leonardo da Vinci.

35:23.033 --> 35:27.413
We have 26 ships at sea
and don't know which ones are infected.

35:27.705 --> 35:31.500
Well, put the ship's ballast
under manual control.

35:31.667 --> 35:33.127
There's no such thing any more.

35:33.252 --> 35:35.629
These ships are totally computerised.

35:35.796 --> 35:38.257
They rely on satellite navigation

35:38.424 --> 35:43.178
which links them to our network,
and the virus, wherever they are.

35:43.595 --> 35:45.389
What are we supposed to do?

35:46.598 --> 35:49.768
Luckily, you have a gifted
and talented security officer.

35:49.935 --> 35:53.689
I traced the hacker's call.
The Secret Service picked him up.

35:53.856 --> 35:58.444
I'll search his files for the original
virus code and eliminate it.

35:58.610 --> 36:01.864
We expect you
to get on this right away.

36:03.741 --> 36:06.910
- How soon?
- As fast as I can.

36:07.077 --> 36:11.540
This is common in corporations
as large as ours. Don't worry about it.

36:12.666 --> 36:15.252
The Secret Service
is helping us out, 100 percent.

36:17.087 --> 36:18.297
We'll be in touch.

36:18.797 --> 36:20.632
What the hell was that all about?

36:20.799 --> 36:24.094
I had to move fast.
The hacker copied my garbage file.

36:24.261 --> 36:25.220
What?

36:25.512 --> 36:28.974
I created da Vinci so we could
get the Secret Service

36:29.183 --> 36:32.603
to arrest the hacker and seize
the equipment, which we can't do alone.

36:32.770 --> 36:39.234
- I don't want to go to jail for this.
- Relax. Think about the $25 million.

36:39.401 --> 36:45.741
But you created a virus that's going to
cause a worldwide ecological disaster.

36:45.908 --> 36:48.827
Just to arrest some hacker kid?

36:48.994 --> 36:50.788
Basically, yes.

36:51.497 --> 36:54.333
Jesus! You're sick, Eugene.

36:54.666 --> 36:55.834
I'll take care of this.

36:57.044 --> 37:01.173
I can cancel it any time.
I don't need the code.

37:01.548 --> 37:03.717
What better way to confiscate the disk

37:03.884 --> 37:06.887
and find out how much of
the garbage file was copied.

37:08.097 --> 37:09.056
Get it!

37:10.641 --> 37:13.310
Why did I ever trust you?

37:15.062 --> 37:19.108
Get the file, otherwise
you'll lose all your toys.

37:26.824 --> 37:30.744
Did you find the virus program
on the disks we confiscated?

37:31.245 --> 37:35.374
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.

37:38.419 --> 37:42.047
Then he stashed it somewhere,
or he has an accomplice.

37:44.925 --> 37:49.596
We'll release him. Keep tight surveillance
and see if he leads us to your disk.

37:55.144 --> 37:59.273
Unit 3, outside suspect
Joey Pardella's apartment.

37:59.398 --> 38:02.484
Suspect still grounded... by his mother.

38:03.152 --> 38:04.361
Listen to this bullshit.

38:04.903 --> 38:09.450
'This is our world now. The world
of the electron and the switch,

38:09.616 --> 38:11.618
'the beauty ofthe baud.

38:11.785 --> 38:16.540
'We exist without nationality,
skin colour or religious bias.

38:16.707 --> 38:19.877
'You wage wars, murder,
cheat, lie to us,

38:20.044 --> 38:23.714
'and try to make us believe it's for
our own good, yet we're the criminals.

38:23.881 --> 38:28.343
'Yes, I am a criminal.
My crime is that of curiosity.

38:28.510 --> 38:33.098
'I am a hacker
and this is my manifesto.'

38:34.516 --> 38:36.143
Right? Manifesto?

38:36.352 --> 38:37.353
'You may stop me,

38:37.478 --> 38:40.230
'but you can't stop us all.'

38:41.357 --> 38:42.524
That's cool.

38:42.691 --> 38:44.735
- Cool?
- Yeah, cool.

38:44.902 --> 38:46.028
You think it's cool?

38:46.195 --> 38:51.158
- It's cool.
- It's not cool. It's commie bullshit.

38:59.291 --> 39:01.335
Can I crash at your place tonight?

39:02.378 --> 39:03.629
What's with him?

39:03.796 --> 39:06.924
His parents missed Woodstock
and he's been making up for it since.

39:07.091 --> 39:08.842
You hear about Joey's bust?

39:10.803 --> 39:13.555
Probably had something to do
with that bank in Idaho.

39:13.764 --> 39:15.557
You think he could hack a Gibson?

39:16.850 --> 39:20.187
- Did you talk to him?
- No. His mom says he's grounded

39:20.354 --> 39:24.316
for his next three lifetimes. And no
'consorting with computer friends'.

39:24.733 --> 39:26.819
The Secret Service is out to get him.

39:27.277 --> 39:29.780
Want to go to a big party tonight?

39:30.406 --> 39:31.615
It's at Kate's.

39:32.950 --> 39:33.909
I thought so.

39:35.452 --> 39:36.745
A little pelvis.

39:37.788 --> 39:38.872
A little pelvis.

39:57.057 --> 39:59.018
What the hell are you doing?

39:59.435 --> 40:00.644
Plague!

40:00.936 --> 40:02.187
Plague!

40:03.355 --> 40:04.273
Gill.

40:05.232 --> 40:06.817
I think we got something.

40:07.192 --> 40:10.237
Yuk! Hard copy!

40:12.072 --> 40:13.574
Dade Murphy.

40:15.451 --> 40:17.578
- Secret Service!
- Don't move!

40:17.703 --> 40:18.412
What are you...?

40:18.537 --> 40:19.872
Shut up!

40:21.707 --> 40:24.126
What are you doing? Get off me!

40:26.295 --> 40:27.171
God!

40:27.796 --> 40:30.549
Sit on the bed and keep your hands
where we can see them.

40:32.509 --> 40:34.803
The year was 1988.

40:34.928 --> 40:39.725
A nasty virus crashed
1,500 systems in one day.

40:42.811 --> 40:44.355
1,507.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.273
It got you 7 years' probation.

40:47.191 --> 40:49.860
No computer. No touchtone phones.

40:51.445 --> 40:54.031
Must have been hell, huh, Zero Cool?

40:55.699 --> 41:00.204
A virus has been planted in
the Ellingson Mineral computer system.

41:00.329 --> 41:02.748
You were our prime suspect.

41:02.873 --> 41:06.335
Till we trashed your stuff
and found no trace of it.

41:06.460 --> 41:11.215
We believe that Joey Pardella
is involved in this Ellingson virus.

41:11.507 --> 41:16.720
He or his accomplice has a disk that
Mr Belford needs to disable that virus.

41:17.888 --> 41:19.932
We want you to help us find it.

41:20.057 --> 41:20.641
Gill.

41:33.320 --> 41:34.446
Loser.

41:37.199 --> 41:39.868
I can't believe you were only 11
when you wrote this.

41:43.122 --> 41:45.165
It's quite an impressive virus.

41:47.710 --> 41:48.711
Dade.

41:50.546 --> 41:55.467
I know how you might feel about narking
on your friends, but... we're hackers.

41:55.634 --> 42:00.264
For us, there's no such thing
as family and friends.

42:00.472 --> 42:05.269
We're each our own country,
with temporary allies and enemies.

42:08.397 --> 42:10.065
Let's make a treaty.

42:11.859 --> 42:14.361
I'm sorry. Who are you?

42:19.199 --> 42:21.368
I'm the one who understands you.

42:22.244 --> 42:24.913
Now, can we be allies?

42:27.249 --> 42:30.878
Nah. I don't play well with others.

42:46.560 --> 42:49.063
Shit! Come on!

42:49.563 --> 42:52.441
Watch which friends you do play with.

42:52.566 --> 42:58.447
With your record, you could land in jail
or get expelled. No college. No future.

42:59.323 --> 43:03.202
Exiled from everyone
and everything you love.

43:06.705 --> 43:08.374
I'll be in touch.

43:09.875 --> 43:12.044
He's fine.
Oh, and Dade,

43:13.629 --> 43:16.590
- try to stay out of trouble, okay?
- Blow me.

43:18.092 --> 43:19.176
Thank you.

44:25.784 --> 44:29.455
Her Mom makes big bucks
writing books for women.

44:29.747 --> 44:33.167
Stuff like 'Women Who Love Men
Who Are Emotional Amoebae'.

44:33.876 --> 44:35.127
That explains a lot.

44:52.102 --> 44:55.439
Big man, stepping in.
Coming through.

44:56.023 --> 44:59.276
Big man, big boots.
You look good, girl.

45:03.197 --> 45:07.368
- Yo, what's up, Nikon?
- In the house, man. Thanks.

45:07.910 --> 45:09.370
Dade, man. You made it.

45:10.788 --> 45:12.623
Houston, we have lift-off.

45:12.748 --> 45:15.751
Three o'clock. Check it.
Don't look right away!

45:15.876 --> 45:17.419
Look at her, man.

45:21.298 --> 45:26.345
Lisa Blair.
26 East 7th Street, apartment 16.

45:26.470 --> 45:27.721
5554817.

45:27.888 --> 45:28.680
Boom!

45:28.847 --> 45:32.351
- How'd you know that?
- I got a photographic memory.

45:33.143 --> 45:34.311
It's a curse.

45:34.520 --> 45:35.771
Lisa!

45:41.610 --> 45:46.907
Oh! Look at that pooper, man.
Spandex, it's a privilege, not a right.

45:53.539 --> 45:56.250
Hi, my name's Vicki and I'm an addict.

45:57.751 --> 46:00.295
Hi. My name's Hank and I'm an addict.

46:02.756 --> 46:04.133
My name's Joey, but...

46:05.300 --> 46:06.385
I'm not an addict.

46:07.553 --> 46:08.804
No, really. Listen.

46:09.012 --> 46:10.681
I got in trouble with my computer.

46:10.806 --> 46:14.852
My lawyer told the judge I'm an addict,
but I'm not addicted to my computer.

46:15.310 --> 46:16.228
No, really.

46:16.979 --> 46:18.063
I'm not an addict.

46:18.439 --> 46:19.356
I'm not.

46:21.025 --> 46:22.359
Can I get some more coffee?

46:34.288 --> 46:36.749
Yo! Check this out.
This is insanely great.

46:36.874 --> 46:39.001
It's got a 28.8 bps modem.

46:39.168 --> 46:42.087
- Yeah? Display?
- Active matrix.

46:42.212 --> 46:44.339
A million psychedelic colours.

46:44.465 --> 46:46.091
This baby is sweet.

46:46.967 --> 46:49.762
- I want it.
- I want it to have my children.

46:50.054 --> 46:51.930
- Bet it looks crispy in the dark.
- Hit the light.

47:10.115 --> 47:11.283
Shit!

47:12.534 --> 47:14.620
Come on. Get out.

47:14.787 --> 47:17.164
- Was that her top?
- One-handed.

47:17.581 --> 47:18.916
Difficulty rating?

47:20.084 --> 47:21.085
Seven.

47:24.004 --> 47:28.175
Wow! Burn's wetware
matches her software.

47:29.885 --> 47:31.220
Burn?

47:32.805 --> 47:34.306
What are you doing here?

47:34.431 --> 47:37.267
We're sorry! Just looking
at your fly laptop.

47:37.393 --> 47:38.852
It's hype, you know.

47:38.977 --> 47:40.437
You're in the butter zone now, baby.

47:43.607 --> 47:44.942
Yeah, it is.

47:46.527 --> 47:48.028
I want to triple the RAM.

47:49.238 --> 47:52.908
Leopard boy and the deceptor cons.

47:54.118 --> 47:57.955
Kate! You're not going into that
computer shit now, right?

47:59.915 --> 48:01.166
Later, babe.

48:02.751 --> 48:05.671
- Yeah, right.
- The sensitive type.

48:07.923 --> 48:09.299
What's he doing here?

48:09.425 --> 48:11.051
He's my guest, Burn.

48:11.510 --> 48:12.594
You're Acid Burn?!

48:12.761 --> 48:14.680
You booted me out of OTV.

48:15.514 --> 48:18.142
- What?
- I'm Crash Override.

48:18.892 --> 48:21.729
You're the moron
who's been invading my turf?

48:23.397 --> 48:24.648
Whoa, whoa! Crash...

48:24.773 --> 48:25.774
and Burn!

48:38.620 --> 48:40.831
Murphy kid turn you down?

48:40.998 --> 48:47.379
I disguised myself as an Alabama State
Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.

48:47.546 --> 48:48.797
Pervert.

48:49.548 --> 48:51.508
What are you talking about?

48:53.969 --> 48:57.765
The FBI computer holds files
on 20 million Americans.

48:58.557 --> 49:00.434
I just hacked into it.

49:00.934 --> 49:02.478
Congratulations.

49:03.187 --> 49:07.149
I have access to every piece of data
stored on Dade Murphy's parents.

49:08.233 --> 49:13.655
His parents separated five years ago,
reconciled, then divorced last year.

49:13.781 --> 49:14.907
Custody battle.

49:15.074 --> 49:17.242
Boy chose to go with his mother.

49:17.659 --> 49:18.619
So?

49:19.995 --> 49:25.209
So, we get the mother, we get the boy.

50:12.172 --> 50:13.799
What the hell are you doing?

50:14.717 --> 50:16.552
It's cool, I'm just looking.

50:18.095 --> 50:20.764
- It's too much machine for you.
- Yeah?

50:31.900 --> 50:34.153
I hope you don't screw like you type.

50:41.118 --> 50:42.870
It has a killer refresh rate.

50:44.246 --> 50:47.958
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.

50:48.083 --> 50:51.378
It's not just the chip. It has a PCI bus.

50:51.503 --> 50:53.630
But... you knew that.

50:54.256 --> 50:55.924
Indeed.

50:56.341 --> 50:58.552
RISC architecture is going
to change everything.

50:58.677 --> 51:01.138
Yeah. RISC is good.

51:06.143 --> 51:09.313
Sure this sweet machine's
not going to waste?

51:11.648 --> 51:14.068
Crash Override. What was it?

51:14.360 --> 51:18.530
'Mess with the best, die like the rest'?

51:19.198 --> 51:20.199
Yeah.

51:24.953 --> 51:26.330
Are you challenging me?

51:26.455 --> 51:27.539
Name your stakes.

51:28.624 --> 51:31.919
If I win, you become my slave.

51:34.004 --> 51:35.005
Your slave?

51:35.547 --> 51:36.757
You wish.

51:37.716 --> 51:40.719
You'll do shit work.
Scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.

51:40.844 --> 51:42.763
Deal. And if I win?

51:42.888 --> 51:45.224
Make it my first born.

51:45.349 --> 51:47.768
- Make it our first date.
- You won't win.

51:48.977 --> 51:50.187
And you have to smile.

51:50.312 --> 51:52.981
I don't do dates.

51:53.732 --> 51:56.944
But I don't lose, either. So you're on.

52:03.325 --> 52:06.161
Here's the deal, the chosen contest:

52:06.286 --> 52:10.082
To hassle Secret Service Agent
Richard Gill and get one back for Joey.

52:15.629 --> 52:19.842
Our decisions are final
by a vote oftwo to one. No appeals.

52:22.678 --> 52:26.056
The duel will last
until we declare a winner.

52:29.601 --> 52:34.356
Use only the access codes
and passwords in your collection.

52:34.481 --> 52:35.899
No help from us.

52:41.196 --> 52:42.614
Talkin' to me?

52:44.658 --> 52:46.076
Any questions?

52:46.201 --> 52:49.913
Yeah. Who's going to notify
his next of kin?

53:43.175 --> 53:45.344
He's in the personal ads.

53:48.389 --> 53:52.976
'Disappointed white male, cross-dresser,
looking for discreet friend

53:53.102 --> 53:55.437
'to bring dreams to reality.

53:55.562 --> 54:01.193
'Leather, lace and water sports.
Transvestites welcome.'

54:01.318 --> 54:04.530
I know where you can stick it.

54:05.322 --> 54:08.367
ljust want to lick
your earlobes and your lips.

54:08.992 --> 54:11.245
You want to lick something? Lick this!

54:12.413 --> 54:14.206
That's why they call me Stallion.

54:14.331 --> 54:15.749
That's disgusting!

54:16.083 --> 54:17.793
My heart is steaming for you...

54:18.127 --> 54:21.380
...spank you with...
- I'll spank your ass!

54:21.547 --> 54:23.841
...turn you over and...
- Agghh!

54:24.383 --> 54:25.092
Animal!

55:09.678 --> 55:12.973
Hey! Hey! Do you know who I am?

55:13.098 --> 55:14.975
Do you know who I am?

55:38.123 --> 55:42.461
This is Accounting, sir. You inquired
about Agent Richard Gill?

55:42.586 --> 55:43.462
Yes.

55:43.587 --> 55:47.424
- Our records indicate he's deceased.
- I'm what?

55:47.549 --> 55:48.884
- Dead.
- Dead?

55:49.009 --> 55:52.179
Yeah. Like rigor mortis, habeas corpus.

55:52.304 --> 55:55.557
- Very impressive.
- Superhero-like, even.

55:56.600 --> 55:57.726
Yeah, whatever.

55:58.769 --> 56:00.062
What's the score?

56:03.190 --> 56:04.191
Tie.

56:06.318 --> 56:08.862
Come on. Due to Mr Gill's
untimely demise,

56:08.987 --> 56:12.282
- you'll have to improvise the next round.
- Right.

56:13.325 --> 56:14.743
I win,

56:16.120 --> 56:17.663
you wear a dress on our date.

56:18.789 --> 56:19.790
And if I win,

56:20.416 --> 56:21.792
so do you.

56:26.797 --> 56:27.715
Deal.

57:06.086 --> 57:06.962
Dade.

57:08.422 --> 57:11.258
I didn't know your size,
so... I guessed.

57:13.385 --> 57:15.012
You will stick with the deal?

57:26.065 --> 57:27.066
Thanks.

57:40.579 --> 57:45.084
You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool?
Let me explain...

57:45.209 --> 57:47.211
the new world order.

57:47.336 --> 57:50.672
Governments and corporations
need people like you...

57:50.798 --> 57:52.466
and me.

57:52.591 --> 57:57.096
We are the samurai,
the keyboard cowboys.

57:57.262 --> 57:59.181
And those otherpeople out there,

57:59.306 --> 58:03.435
who have no idea what's going on,
are the cattle.

58:03.560 --> 58:05.688
Moo.

58:05.813 --> 58:09.900
I need your help. You need my help.

58:10.025 --> 58:13.028
Let me help you earn your spurs.

58:14.446 --> 58:15.489
Think about it.

58:16.907 --> 58:19.993
Enjoy the laptop... Cool.

58:21.245 --> 58:23.288
Tell me where the disk is.

58:30.462 --> 58:32.339
You look pitiful.

58:34.174 --> 58:38.721
Okay, you're not grounded any more.

59:05.080 --> 59:08.000
- Yo, what's up?
- I gotta talk to you, man. Listen.

59:08.125 --> 59:11.879
- I copied a garbage file.
- So? A garbage file has shit in it.

59:12.004 --> 59:14.173
It's hot or something.

59:14.298 --> 59:19.011
Joey, a garbage file holds odd data.
Stuff that's been erased.

59:19.136 --> 59:21.138
I copied it from Ellingson, okay?

59:21.263 --> 59:24.099
They're asking me about it.
Will you take a look for me?

59:27.311 --> 59:28.812
Shit, Joey. You got a tail.

59:30.272 --> 59:31.273
Shit!

01:00:16.652 --> 01:00:19.488
I am watching you.

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:23.909
Wake up.

01:00:25.828 --> 01:00:26.870
Ramon?

01:00:27.204 --> 01:00:30.457
Wake up. Ramon, it's time for school.

01:00:31.542 --> 01:00:32.543
Come on.

01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:37.297
Stick your hands up! Don't move!

01:00:37.423 --> 01:00:38.590
Déjà vu!

01:00:38.716 --> 01:00:42.428
You're under arrest under the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.

01:00:43.137 --> 01:00:44.263
¡La computadora de mierda!

01:00:44.388 --> 01:00:46.265
¡Que te dije de no estar
jugando con esa

01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:48.767
- computadora!
- What are you waiting for? Arrest me!

01:01:00.154 --> 01:01:02.406
You get one call.

01:01:03.699 --> 01:01:05.034
Uno.

01:01:05.826 --> 01:01:07.453
Understand?

01:01:22.551 --> 01:01:24.470
Operator Services?

01:01:24.595 --> 01:01:26.638
- I'm having trouble with a number.
- What number, please?

01:01:26.764 --> 01:01:28.724
5554202.

01:01:28.849 --> 01:01:30.434
- Just one moment.
- Thank you.

01:01:32.019 --> 01:01:34.188
- Hello?
- It's me. I'm freaking.

01:01:34.313 --> 01:01:38.609
Joey really hacked into Ellingson.
He gave me the disk he copied

01:01:38.734 --> 01:01:41.570
and now I'm injail
for some serious shit!

01:01:41.695 --> 01:01:45.366
Stuff I didn't even do, like inserting
a virus called 'da Vinci'?

01:01:45.491 --> 01:01:47.493
And they keep asking about you guys.

01:01:47.618 --> 01:01:49.203
- Think they're gonna bust us?
- Yeah.

01:01:49.328 --> 01:01:52.331
You better figure out what's on that disk
'cause we're being framed.

01:01:52.498 --> 01:01:54.625
It's in the place where
I put that thing once.

01:02:30.619 --> 01:02:31.203
Hi.

01:02:33.455 --> 01:02:34.790
Now I see what all the fuss is about.

01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:43.382
You have company.

01:02:46.969 --> 01:02:49.138
- Nice room.
- We need your help.

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.350
Do my ears deceive me?

01:02:55.894 --> 01:02:59.148
No, no. Truce, you guys.
We got a higher purpose here.

01:02:59.314 --> 01:03:01.525
A wake-up call for
the Nintendo generation.

01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:03.360
We demand free access to data.

01:03:03.485 --> 01:03:06.155
Well, it comes with some responsibility.

01:03:06.405 --> 01:03:10.617
'When I was a child, I spake as a child,
I thought as a child.

01:03:10.784 --> 01:03:13.829
'But when I became a man,
I put away childish things'.

01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:17.458
What? It's Corinthians One,

01:03:17.583 --> 01:03:21.295
Chapter 13, verse 11, you know?
Come on.

01:03:25.716 --> 01:03:28.093
Phreak and Joey are being framed.

01:03:28.218 --> 01:03:30.596
Can you help us find out
what's on this disk?

01:03:30.804 --> 01:03:31.847
I can't.

01:03:32.348 --> 01:03:35.601
Everybody who touches that disk
gets arrested. I can't risk arrest.

01:03:35.726 --> 01:03:36.935
I'm sorry.

01:03:41.231 --> 01:03:43.484
Maybe I should go to the bathroom.

01:03:51.283 --> 01:03:52.785
What is it with you?

01:03:53.786 --> 01:03:58.332
We're supposed to be on the same side
and we really need your help.

01:03:59.958 --> 01:04:01.794
I really need your help.

01:04:04.088 --> 01:04:06.507
I'm sorry. I can't.

01:04:10.969 --> 01:04:12.513
Could you copy the disk?

01:04:12.638 --> 01:04:16.600
And just hide it in case we get busted
so we have a copy for our lawyers.

01:04:16.725 --> 01:04:18.686
Something that hasn't been
tampered with.

01:04:23.315 --> 01:04:25.359
You guys help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

01:04:25.484 --> 01:04:26.985
Cereal has.

01:04:33.242 --> 01:04:35.619
Okay. I'll copy it.

01:04:35.828 --> 01:04:36.787
Thank you.

01:04:44.086 --> 01:04:45.963
The girl. The girl has the disk I need.

01:04:47.256 --> 01:04:49.717
I told you.
I don't play well with others.

01:04:50.509 --> 01:04:52.428
Turn on your laptop.

01:04:53.262 --> 01:04:55.431
Set it to receive a file.

01:05:03.355 --> 01:05:07.484
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon
in the state of Washington.

01:05:08.902 --> 01:05:12.239
Forgery, embezzlement,
two drug convictions

01:05:12.364 --> 01:05:16.618
plus jumping parole. Once arrested,
she will have no trial,

01:05:16.744 --> 01:05:20.956
she will notpass 'Go',
she will go directly tojail.

01:05:21.123 --> 01:05:26.962
Then I change this file back to the original
and your mom disappears.

01:05:27.087 --> 01:05:28.297
That's bullshit.

01:05:28.922 --> 01:05:32.843
What can I tell you?
Computers never lie, kid.

01:05:33.927 --> 01:05:39.641
Your mom will be arrested,
handcuffed and later strip-searched.

01:05:39.767 --> 01:05:42.436
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.

01:05:43.312 --> 01:05:45.606
Kid, don't threaten me.

01:05:46.065 --> 01:05:50.694
There are worse things than death...
and I can do all of them.

01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:31.276
Talk to me.

01:06:31.402 --> 01:06:34.947
I got it. But Kate didn't know
what's on it,

01:06:35.072 --> 01:06:37.074
she came to me to figure it out.

01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:40.786
She didn't plant the virus.
You leave her alone.

01:06:40.911 --> 01:06:44.748
Don't worry, kid. lfshe's innocent,

01:06:44.873 --> 01:06:46.375
she'll be fine.

01:06:48.043 --> 01:06:50.796
Your mommy's safe now, okay?

01:08:13.545 --> 01:08:14.505
Kate, Listen.

01:08:15.255 --> 01:08:16.381
Hold on.

01:08:16.548 --> 01:08:19.301
- I have to tell you something.
- Hold on!

01:08:19.593 --> 01:08:22.805
- It's so lean and clean.
- Looks like a hacker wrote it.

01:08:23.514 --> 01:08:25.224
Come here. Look at this.

01:08:25.849 --> 01:08:27.643
This thing is tense.

01:08:28.685 --> 01:08:30.312
That's ill, man.

01:08:30.813 --> 01:08:32.272
It's incomplete.

01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:37.194
This'll take forever to figure out.
I'll make some coffee.

01:08:40.572 --> 01:08:42.032
Tag, you're in.

01:10:02.363 --> 01:10:06.241
- It's not a virus. It's a worm.
- What's it eat?

01:10:06.367 --> 01:10:08.160
It nibbles. You see all of this?

01:10:08.285 --> 01:10:11.538
This is all of Ellingson's
financial transactions.

01:10:11.705 --> 01:10:15.209
From million dollar deals
to $10 some guy pays for gas.

01:10:15.334 --> 01:10:17.336
The worm eats a few cents
from each transaction.

01:10:17.503 --> 01:10:19.963
No-one's caught it because
the money isn't really gone.

01:10:20.130 --> 01:10:21.924
It's just data being shifted around.

01:10:22.091 --> 01:10:26.303
And when the worm's ready, it zips out
with the money and erases its tracks.

01:10:26.428 --> 01:10:28.847
Joey got cut off before he got to that part.
Check it out.

01:10:29.014 --> 01:10:33.060
Here it's already running
at twice the speed as when it started.

01:10:33.227 --> 01:10:35.896
- At this rate, the run ends in...
...two days.

01:10:36.063 --> 01:10:40.651
- It's already eaten about...
...21.8 million bucks.

01:10:41.985 --> 01:10:44.988
Whoever wrote this
needs someone to take the fall.

01:10:45.114 --> 01:10:47.866
That's Phreak and Joey and us.

01:10:48.033 --> 01:10:52.246
We have to find out where the money's
going before the worm disappears,

01:10:52.413 --> 01:10:54.707
so we can find out who created it.

01:10:54.873 --> 01:10:56.125
I know who wrote it!

01:10:56.583 --> 01:10:57.459
What?

01:10:57.626 --> 01:10:59.253
This Ellingson security creep.

01:10:59.878 --> 01:11:02.965
I gave him a copy of the disk
you gave me.

01:11:03.132 --> 01:11:04.008
You what?

01:11:04.174 --> 01:11:05.884
I didn't know what was on it.

01:11:06.010 --> 01:11:09.430
Oh, man! That's universally stupid, man.

01:11:09.596 --> 01:11:11.140
Yo, man. You're an amateur.

01:11:12.808 --> 01:11:13.892
Why did he come to you?

01:11:14.059 --> 01:11:15.853
I've got a record.

01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:17.896
I was Zero Cool.

01:11:18.022 --> 01:11:24.194
Zero Cool crashed 1,507 systems
in one day. Biggest crash in history.

01:11:24.361 --> 01:11:27.364
Front page New York Times,
August 10, 1988.

01:11:28.699 --> 01:11:30.409
I thought you was black, man.

01:11:31.035 --> 01:11:33.370
Yo, man, this is Zero Cool!

01:11:34.288 --> 01:11:35.372
That's far out!

01:11:35.539 --> 01:11:36.915
This is Zero Cool, man!

01:11:38.333 --> 01:11:39.918
Yeah, that's great.

01:11:40.335 --> 01:11:41.253
There goes MIT.

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:43.505
- I'll make it up!
- How?

01:11:44.798 --> 01:11:46.008
I'll hack the Gibson.

01:11:46.175 --> 01:11:48.177
They'll trace you like that, man.

01:11:48.344 --> 01:11:50.137
The cops will find you
with a smoking gun.

01:11:50.262 --> 01:11:51.513
Fucked if I care, man.

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.850
Even with the password,
it'd take you ten minutes to get in,

01:11:55.017 --> 01:11:56.643
then you'd have to find the files.

01:11:56.769 --> 01:11:59.021
The cops would have you in five minutes.

01:11:59.188 --> 01:12:01.857
Oh, wow! We are fried!

01:12:01.982 --> 01:12:04.485
Never send a boy to do a woman's job.

01:12:04.651 --> 01:12:06.737
With me, we can do it in seven.

01:12:06.987 --> 01:12:09.531
I help, we do it in six.

01:12:09.698 --> 01:12:13.911
I gotta save all your asses!
I help, we do it in five minutes.

01:12:14.078 --> 01:12:16.580
Okay. Let's go shopping.

01:12:44.942 --> 01:12:46.026
You know,

01:12:46.652 --> 01:12:51.699
if I didn't live by a strict code of honour,
I might take advantage of this situation.

01:12:51.824 --> 01:12:53.867
Erotically, as it were.

01:13:18.517 --> 01:13:20.436
All right. Hold it right there.

01:13:25.691 --> 01:13:27.026
Shit!

01:13:27.151 --> 01:13:29.194
My subway defence system.

01:13:34.908 --> 01:13:36.493
He's way down there.

01:13:38.287 --> 01:13:39.288
Ta-da!

01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:43.333
- Yo, brain-dead... the manual!
- Oops!

01:13:49.381 --> 01:13:50.382
Hey!

01:13:50.966 --> 01:13:51.967
Truck!

01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:57.181
Find it?

01:13:58.474 --> 01:14:01.810
The phone's all right. The problem
must be somewhere else.

01:14:41.725 --> 01:14:45.979
They had a large chunk
of the garbage file?

01:14:48.774 --> 01:14:52.361
- How much do they know?
- Enough to implicate us.

01:14:52.486 --> 01:14:55.155
You said the worm was untraceable.

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.242
Yeah... to civilians.
But they're hackers.

01:14:58.367 --> 01:15:02.037
Don't worry.
We just launch the da Vinci virus.

01:15:02.705 --> 01:15:05.624
- Then they'll all be put away.
- Launch the da Vinci virus?

01:15:05.749 --> 01:15:09.503
- You can't do that.
- No-one believes the guilty.

01:15:09.628 --> 01:15:15.509
By the time they realise the truth,
we'll be long gone with all our money.

01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:19.388
Look, there is no right and wrong.

01:15:19.596 --> 01:15:22.474
There is only fun... and boring.

01:15:23.475 --> 01:15:27.062
A 30-year prison sentence
sounds pretty dull to me.

01:15:27.396 --> 01:15:28.856
Who do you prefer serves it?

01:15:29.023 --> 01:15:31.567
Us... or them?

01:15:49.376 --> 01:15:54.798
Unless $5 million is transferred
to the following account in seven days,

01:15:54.923 --> 01:15:57.968
I will capsize five Ellingson tankers.

01:15:58.093 --> 01:16:00.471
The virus goes off
tomorrow at 10.30AM,

01:16:00.596 --> 01:16:03.307
and those hackers tried
to get into our system again.

01:16:03.432 --> 01:16:06.435
I insist you take more strenuous action

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:10.522
or Ellingson Mineral will hold
the Secret Service responsible.

01:16:14.193 --> 01:16:17.613
Get me arrest warrants
on Kate Libby, alias Acid Burn,

01:16:17.738 --> 01:16:20.157
Emmanuel Goldstein,
alias Cereal Killer,

01:16:20.282 --> 01:16:23.243
Dade Murphy,
alias Crash Override, also known as

01:16:23.369 --> 01:16:28.290
Zero Cool, and Paul Cook,
alias Lord Nikon.

01:16:28.624 --> 01:16:31.085
Pick them up tomorrow at 9.00AM.

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:33.962
Snoop on to them

01:16:34.088 --> 01:16:36.131
as they snoop on to us.

01:16:41.345 --> 01:16:45.933
- Yeah, it's Kate.
- Hey, Burn. We got a little problem.

01:17:03.992 --> 01:17:05.077
So, what've we got?

01:17:05.202 --> 01:17:09.748
Well, 50 passwords, plus whatever
Polaroid-head got inside Ellingson.

01:17:09.873 --> 01:17:11.500
I got a lot, right?

01:17:11.875 --> 01:17:13.669
I don't know how many, but...

01:17:14.628 --> 01:17:15.754
my head hurts.

01:17:15.879 --> 01:17:17.381
Yo, check this out.

01:17:18.257 --> 01:17:19.883
- What's a da Vinci virus?
- What?

01:17:20.009 --> 01:17:24.805
It's a memo about how they'll deal with
the oil spills that happened on the 14th.

01:17:25.931 --> 01:17:27.266
What oil spills?

01:17:29.309 --> 01:17:33.105
- Brain-dead. Today's the 13th.
- Well, this hasn't happened yet.

01:17:33.313 --> 01:17:35.983
The 14th is the day the worm ends it run.

01:17:38.736 --> 01:17:42.322
Isn't the da Vinci virus
what Phreak's being charged with?

01:17:42.448 --> 01:17:46.452
Look. 'lnfecting ballast programs
of Ellingson tankers'.

01:17:46.744 --> 01:17:47.870
They blame hackers!

01:17:47.995 --> 01:17:48.996
Damn!

01:17:49.288 --> 01:17:51.248
A worm and a virus?

01:17:51.415 --> 01:17:52.958
The plot thickens.

01:17:59.006 --> 01:18:00.883
Whoa, whoa! Where are you going?

01:18:01.008 --> 01:18:02.009
I got an idea.

01:18:02.634 --> 01:18:04.970
We got a few hours until we're arrested.

01:18:05.095 --> 01:18:08.015
Stay low. I'm going to get help.

01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:09.767
I'll beep you.

01:18:12.269 --> 01:18:13.270
Are you coming?

01:18:17.775 --> 01:18:19.818
May the Force be with you, man.

01:18:48.263 --> 01:18:49.723
There they are!

01:18:50.265 --> 01:18:53.686
Razor and Blade?! They're flakes!

01:18:53.811 --> 01:18:57.272
They're elite! Let's get 'em.

01:19:49.158 --> 01:19:52.327
Get off the stage, man! Get off!

01:20:15.976 --> 01:20:17.436
I lost them!

01:20:19.146 --> 01:20:20.439
Where were you?

01:20:35.621 --> 01:20:37.414
I don't like this.

01:20:42.419 --> 01:20:44.630
I definitely don't like this.

01:20:44.963 --> 01:20:47.049
What do you want?

01:20:51.011 --> 01:20:53.055
We come in peace.

01:20:55.182 --> 01:20:57.851
We need your help, if you're up to it.

01:20:59.144 --> 01:21:01.355
She's buff. Ballsy.

01:21:02.398 --> 01:21:03.440
Let's keep her.

01:21:03.607 --> 01:21:04.733
Waste the dude.

01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:16.537
A virus called da Vinci will cause
oil spills tomorrow at 10.30AM.

01:21:16.912 --> 01:21:19.373
It's somehow connected to that worm.

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:24.336
We need you to overload the Gibson so
we can kill da Vinci and copy the worm.

01:21:24.962 --> 01:21:27.798
She's rabid... but cute.

01:21:28.298 --> 01:21:30.968
See, we're very busy.

01:21:31.135 --> 01:21:37.224
A TV network that wishes to remain
nameless is interested in our show.

01:21:38.142 --> 01:21:39.518
Let's go, Kate.

01:21:42.396 --> 01:21:43.772
Wait.

01:21:44.648 --> 01:21:46.650
Nobody said no.

01:21:47.234 --> 01:21:51.447
But you will need more than
just two media icons like us.

01:21:51.989 --> 01:21:52.948
You need an army.

01:21:53.115 --> 01:21:58.287
That's it. An electronic army.
If I were us,

01:21:58.454 --> 01:22:02.333
I'd get on the Internet,
send out a major distress signal.

01:22:02.916 --> 01:22:04.376
Hackers of the world, unite!

01:22:04.668 --> 01:22:06.295
How will you take care of the cops?

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:28.442
I'm blowing up!

01:22:28.567 --> 01:22:31.153
It's Kate. Grand Central.
Let's hit it!

01:23:39.763 --> 01:23:40.889
You're the man!

01:23:41.890 --> 01:23:42.891
You're the man!

01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:05.539
Joey, you made it!

01:24:10.044 --> 01:24:12.755
Okay. Use your best viruses
to buy us some time.

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.715
We must get in and copy the worm.

01:24:17.259 --> 01:24:19.303
I had to do that to break the tension.

01:24:20.179 --> 01:24:22.890
- Cereal. Go fix the phones.
- Roger.

01:24:25.142 --> 01:24:26.935
Joey, take his place.

01:24:28.145 --> 01:24:30.064
- Me?
- Take his place. Do it.

01:24:30.272 --> 01:24:31.690
You can do it.

01:24:32.775 --> 01:24:33.734
Ready?

01:24:35.444 --> 01:24:37.071
Let's boot up.

01:25:32.918 --> 01:25:36.463
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Nothing. Just a minor glitch.

01:25:36.588 --> 01:25:39.800
A minor glitch with you seems
to turn into a major catastrophe.

01:25:45.973 --> 01:25:47.975
There's a new virus in the database.

01:25:48.142 --> 01:25:49.351
What's happening?

01:25:49.476 --> 01:25:51.603
It's eating memory. What do I do?

01:25:51.729 --> 01:25:52.896
Type 'cookie', you idiot.

01:25:53.022 --> 01:25:54.940
I'll head them off at the pass.

01:25:59.194 --> 01:26:01.739
We have a bug attacking all log-in files.

01:26:01.864 --> 01:26:04.241
Run anti-virus.
Give me a systems display.

01:26:11.582 --> 01:26:13.125
Die, dickweeds!

01:26:16.795 --> 01:26:18.380
A rabbit's in the system.

01:26:18.505 --> 01:26:19.381
Send a flu shot.

01:26:19.506 --> 01:26:22.259
Rabbit? Flu shot? Someone talk to me.

01:26:22.384 --> 01:26:26.513
A rabbit replicates till it overloads
a file then spreads like cancer.

01:26:26.638 --> 01:26:27.723
Cancer?

01:26:28.557 --> 01:26:32.686
Row, row, row your boat

01:26:32.811 --> 01:26:35.189
Gently down the stream.

01:26:35.314 --> 01:26:38.233
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,

01:26:38.359 --> 01:26:40.778
Life is but a dream.

01:26:42.404 --> 01:26:44.031
Whoa! Falling off!

01:26:44.907 --> 01:26:46.658
It's a Gibson, it's finding us too fast.

01:27:02.341 --> 01:27:05.177
There's too many garbage files.
I need more time.

01:27:11.892 --> 01:27:16.647
They're at Grand Central station,
lower level. Don't screw up.

01:27:16.772 --> 01:27:18.232
Get out of here!

01:27:18.357 --> 01:27:21.485
Everyone, let's move! Move it!

01:27:21.902 --> 01:27:23.737
Get the hell out of the way! Come on!

01:27:23.862 --> 01:27:25.531
Grand Central!

01:27:29.827 --> 01:27:33.664
Game's over. Last chance to get out
of this without a prison sentence.

01:27:33.789 --> 01:27:35.124
You're not good enough to beat me.

01:27:35.249 --> 01:27:38.919
Maybe I'm not. But we are,

01:27:39.044 --> 01:27:41.505
- you asshole!
- Give it up!

01:27:42.589 --> 01:27:45.300
Just give it up.

01:27:49.096 --> 01:27:50.556
Are we fashionably late?

01:27:56.478 --> 01:27:57.813
Okay, let's go!

01:29:04.797 --> 01:29:08.217
We have massive infection.
Multiple GPI viruses...

01:29:08.342 --> 01:29:09.593
...from remote nodes.

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:12.221
- They're going for the kernel.
- Colonel who?

01:29:12.346 --> 01:29:14.390
The command processor. The brain!

01:29:14.515 --> 01:29:16.600
Cancer, brain. Brain cancer!

01:29:17.267 --> 01:29:18.394
What's going on?

01:29:18.519 --> 01:29:20.896
In short, Duke, a shitstorm.

01:29:22.981 --> 01:29:24.817
Move! Go!

01:30:05.983 --> 01:30:07.568
I found it!

01:30:08.277 --> 01:30:09.570
I found it!

01:30:34.136 --> 01:30:36.597
This is the end, my friend.

01:30:38.265 --> 01:30:39.558
Thank you for calling.

01:30:43.145 --> 01:30:44.188
Shit!

01:30:44.355 --> 01:30:45.647
He got me!

01:30:46.315 --> 01:30:47.566
Joey's gettin' stupid busy.

01:30:49.068 --> 01:30:52.529
Joey, go after the worm.
You're the closest.

01:30:54.073 --> 01:30:57.576
It's root, slash, period, 'workspace',

01:30:57.701 --> 01:31:00.454
slash, period, 'garbage', period.

01:31:03.707 --> 01:31:05.292
Out of the way!

01:31:08.712 --> 01:31:11.006
Out of the way! Freeze!

01:31:15.010 --> 01:31:15.594
Come on!

01:31:41.704 --> 01:31:42.413
All right! Wow!

01:31:44.289 --> 01:31:45.374
Kill the Gibson!

01:31:45.541 --> 01:31:46.500
Roger that.

01:31:52.464 --> 01:31:55.426
Come on, you son of a bitch.
Is that all you got?

01:31:56.010 --> 01:31:58.429
Come on! Let's see what else you can do.

01:31:58.554 --> 01:32:03.475
You talking to me, huh?
Are you nuts? Come at me!

01:32:07.187 --> 01:32:08.981
They're in the kernel.

01:32:09.106 --> 01:32:10.315
Help me!

01:32:12.985 --> 01:32:15.904
The tankers have stopped capsizing.

01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:17.781
Ballast tanks emptying.

01:32:17.906 --> 01:32:19.366
Should be okay.

01:32:32.546 --> 01:32:34.340
Little pissant!

01:32:46.727 --> 01:32:47.728
Yes!

01:32:50.022 --> 01:32:51.565
Let's get outta here!

01:32:51.690 --> 01:32:52.441
Freeze!

01:33:12.503 --> 01:33:14.713
They're trashing our rights, man.

01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:17.883
They're trashing the flow of data.

01:33:18.050 --> 01:33:19.218
Trashing!

01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:20.594
Trashing!

01:33:20.886 --> 01:33:21.887
Trashing!

01:33:22.805 --> 01:33:24.515
Hack the planet!

01:33:24.807 --> 01:33:26.684
- Hack the planet!
- Shut up and get in!

01:33:26.850 --> 01:33:28.644
Hack the planet!

01:33:28.894 --> 01:33:30.229
Hack the planet!

01:33:37.945 --> 01:33:40.155
- Hello.
- We caught them.

01:33:40.322 --> 01:33:42.199
- Good.
- Red-handed.

01:33:43.158 --> 01:33:45.369
You won't be having
any more trouble from them.

01:33:58.757 --> 01:34:03.387
Me, all right? I did it.
She knows shit about computers.

01:34:05.097 --> 01:34:06.807
She's just my girlfriend.

01:34:09.643 --> 01:34:12.104
I suggest you modify your attitude,

01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:13.939
because you are floating

01:34:14.064 --> 01:34:15.858
and I am about to flush your ass.

01:34:17.526 --> 01:34:20.696
Mrs Murphy is here to see you, sir.

01:34:27.995 --> 01:34:30.956
- Are you crazy? What are you doing?
- Trying to help you.

01:34:37.463 --> 01:34:39.173
- Dade.
- What?

01:34:40.549 --> 01:34:41.633
Thanks for your help.

01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:50.267
Your son is in big trouble.

01:34:50.601 --> 01:34:54.980
He violated his probation and
has engaged in criminal activities.

01:34:55.856 --> 01:34:58.067
My son happens to be a genius.

01:34:58.192 --> 01:35:02.321
He understands things that you won't
comprehend if you live to be 100.

01:35:02.446 --> 01:35:05.074
He would never use his knowledge
to harm others.

01:35:05.199 --> 01:35:07.242
The news crew you requested is here.

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:09.495
Good. I have some things to tell them.

01:35:09.745 --> 01:35:13.582
Your son is facing 30 felony counts
in an ongoing investigation.

01:35:13.749 --> 01:35:16.126
You face arrest if you do that.

01:35:16.251 --> 01:35:18.045
I don't care if I face certain death.

01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:20.881
Mrs Murphy stays right here.

01:35:22.925 --> 01:35:24.802
Wow. She's great.

01:35:26.303 --> 01:35:26.970
Yeah.

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:30.808
...and attacked the Ellingson network.

01:35:30.974 --> 01:35:34.061
Is this the last we've seen
of this kind ofespionage?

01:35:35.229 --> 01:35:38.315
No. Hackers are a grave threat
to the national security.

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:41.402
This incident just proves
that we need

01:35:41.527 --> 01:35:44.071
- increased funding to stop...
- We're getting interference.

01:35:44.238 --> 01:35:46.532
Hola, boys and girls.
It is I, Cereal Killer,

01:35:46.657 --> 01:35:51.787
making my first worldwide
global television appearance.

01:35:52.413 --> 01:35:54.665
Yes, that's right.

01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:58.335
I'm here to tell you about this heinous
scheme hatched within Ellingson Mineral.

01:35:59.378 --> 01:36:00.254
But for what?

01:36:00.379 --> 01:36:02.923
World domination? Nay.

01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:06.385
Something far more tacky.

01:36:06.844 --> 01:36:12.599
A virus called da Vinci, that would cause
Ellingson tankers to capsize,

01:36:12.725 --> 01:36:17.438
was to be blamed on innocent hackers.
This virus was really a smokescreen.

01:36:17.563 --> 01:36:24.403
What could be so important to protect
that someone would create such a nasty,

01:36:24.486 --> 01:36:27.364
anti-social, uncool virus program?

01:36:27.489 --> 01:36:28.574
But why?

01:36:29.116 --> 01:36:31.660
Could it be to cover the tracks
of this worm program?

01:36:31.785 --> 01:36:34.872
A worm that was to steal 25 million bucks.

01:36:35.122 --> 01:36:38.042
The password for this worm
belongs to Margo Wallace,

01:36:38.167 --> 01:36:41.211
- head ofPublic Relations at Ellingson.
- Oh, my God!

01:36:41.337 --> 01:36:43.255
And Eugene Belford,

01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:46.884
- computer security officer.
- Son of a bitch!

01:36:47.551 --> 01:36:52.431
What's this? The account in the Bahamas
where the money was to be stashed?

01:36:52.556 --> 01:36:53.640
I think so.

01:36:53.766 --> 01:36:55.517
Unlucky!

01:36:57.394 --> 01:36:58.562
Yo.

01:36:58.687 --> 01:37:00.564
I kinda feel like God.

01:37:05.778 --> 01:37:07.112
Plague?

01:37:09.615 --> 01:37:10.616
Eugene?

01:37:21.043 --> 01:37:26.757
I don't even know how to work the VCR
let alone a computer. Get off!

01:37:26.882 --> 01:37:32.721
Listen, I'll make a deal. Eugene Belford.
I know where his mother is.

01:37:32.846 --> 01:37:35.307
Get off me! I need a lawyer!

01:37:45.901 --> 01:37:47.861
Here you are, Mr Babbage.

01:37:47.986 --> 01:37:52.074
Flight time to Tokyo is 14 hours.
Can I get you anything else?

01:37:52.199 --> 01:37:54.576
Just a pillow, please.

01:38:00.916 --> 01:38:02.001
Thank you.

01:38:04.461 --> 01:38:06.296
You're welcome.

01:38:06.422 --> 01:38:09.133
What's going on? Let go of me!
Stewardess!

01:38:09.258 --> 01:38:11.969
I'll never fly this airline again!

01:38:22.521 --> 01:38:24.690
You look good in a dress.

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:27.609
You would have looked better.

01:38:34.366 --> 01:38:36.243
Wanna go for a swim?

01:38:46.962 --> 01:38:49.965
I can't believe they decided you won.

01:38:50.966 --> 01:38:55.346
They didn't. The guys felt it was
the only way I'd get a date.

01:38:58.557 --> 01:38:59.725
Anyway,

01:39:01.518 --> 01:39:03.228
you're pretty good.

01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:05.064
You're elite.

01:39:06.815 --> 01:39:07.983
Yeah?

01:39:08.525 --> 01:39:13.238
If you'd said that at the start,
you would have avoided a lot of trouble.

01:39:25.334 --> 01:39:26.835
Beat that!

01:39:40.391 --> 01:39:41.600
You know,

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:47.481
- I've been having these weird...
...dreams.

01:39:48.524 --> 01:40:23.600
