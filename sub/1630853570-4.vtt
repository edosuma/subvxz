WEBVTT

00:08.126 --> 00:09.960
-(wind blowing)
-(birds chirping)

00:15.366 --> 00:17.468
(wood creaking)

00:49.667 --> 00:51.502
*

01:20.765 --> 01:22.567
*

01:39.116 --> 01:40.451
(Chase sighs)

01:49.594 --> 01:52.062
The easiest thing
for me to do now

01:52.062 --> 01:54.699
would be to apologize.

01:54.732 --> 01:55.900
Uh...

01:55.900 --> 01:57.535
It's important
for you to understand

01:57.568 --> 02:00.238
why I can't do that.

02:00.238 --> 02:02.873
That guy in your house--

02:02.907 --> 02:05.576
he was a professional.

02:05.576 --> 02:08.279
Whoever hired him was serious

02:08.313 --> 02:10.248
about putting
an end to me, and...

02:12.082 --> 02:13.784
And in my experience, that means

02:13.818 --> 02:15.286
putting an end
to anyone close to me.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.422
That's... that's you.

02:18.923 --> 02:22.260
Keeping you alive and safe--

02:22.293 --> 02:24.829
that became the priority, Zoe.

02:36.774 --> 02:38.276
I'm not gonna hurt you.

02:40.811 --> 02:43.748
(sighs) I figured if you
wanted to yell at me

02:43.781 --> 02:46.784
or scream or whatever, this
would be a safe place to do it.

02:52.790 --> 02:54.625
Okay.

02:54.625 --> 02:56.794
We got a long drive ahead of us.

02:56.827 --> 02:59.330
When you're ready to talk,
we can talk.

03:01.632 --> 03:03.834
There is...

03:03.868 --> 03:06.337
one thing I'm gonna
ask you to do.

03:10.475 --> 03:12.977
I'd like you to call your son.

03:18.015 --> 03:20.485
The FBI is gonna
knock on his door.

03:20.485 --> 03:22.353
They're gonna
ask him some questions.

03:24.322 --> 03:26.491
He's gonna do fine, but he's...

03:26.491 --> 03:28.326
you know,
he's gonna be concerned.

03:28.359 --> 03:31.896
Now is the best time to, oh,
set the record straight.

03:38.703 --> 03:40.170
This'll be the last time

03:40.170 --> 03:43.674
you make a call on your phone,

03:43.708 --> 03:46.344
to keep from tracking us,
but at least,

03:46.344 --> 03:48.245
you know,
he'll know it's you calling.

03:52.049 --> 03:53.518
(grunts)

03:53.518 --> 03:55.886
When... You know,
just tell him the truth.

03:57.688 --> 04:01.225
That you're unhurt,

04:01.258 --> 04:03.894
and you're being held
against your will,

04:03.928 --> 04:07.197
but you're safe and that
you'll contact him again soon.

04:10.935 --> 04:13.838
Yeah. You use those words,
that'll prevent you

04:13.871 --> 04:16.741
from being considered
an accessory to anything.

04:19.043 --> 04:20.044
(sighs)

04:28.419 --> 04:30.455
(line ringing)

04:37.595 --> 04:39.730
JASON (over recording):
Hey, this is Jason.
Leave a message.

04:45.603 --> 04:47.405
(dialing)

04:51.776 --> 04:54.612
(line ringing)

04:54.645 --> 04:56.981
JASON (over recording):
Hey, this is Jason.
Leave a message.

05:23.508 --> 05:25.342
*

05:28.679 --> 05:30.915
(sighs) You know,
I guess we'd better,

05:30.948 --> 05:32.950
uh...

05:32.950 --> 05:34.652
get going.

05:48.966 --> 05:49.867
(engine starts)

06:01.345 --> 06:03.614
JOE:
Local PDs, negative.

06:03.648 --> 06:05.950
Regional offices, negative.

06:05.983 --> 06:08.619
Digital teams,
that's interagency,

06:08.653 --> 06:11.989
that's across the board,
negative.

06:11.989 --> 06:13.958
It's been 72 hours
since law enforcement

06:13.991 --> 06:17.027
had any signal
on his whereabouts.

06:17.061 --> 06:19.697
Dan Chase is gone.

06:22.199 --> 06:24.168
And the woman-- McDonald?

06:24.201 --> 06:25.636
No sign of her, either.

06:25.670 --> 06:27.004
We made contact with her son.

06:27.004 --> 06:28.706
She called him,
but they didn't speak.

06:28.739 --> 06:31.375
That was three days ago as wel.

06:31.408 --> 06:34.311
We'll keep our ears open,
but, um...

06:34.344 --> 06:36.180
Yeah.

06:36.213 --> 06:38.549
Okay. Thanks, Joe.

06:38.583 --> 06:39.750
Yeah.

06:43.754 --> 06:45.556
(indistinct conversation)

06:53.598 --> 06:55.533
ANGELA:
Jaden? Or Caden, maybe?

06:55.566 --> 06:56.701
HARPER:
Brayden.

06:56.734 --> 06:59.203
His father is
the assistant secretary

06:59.203 --> 07:01.005
of state for African affairs,

07:01.038 --> 07:03.207
but that's...

07:03.207 --> 07:04.875
neither here nor there.

07:04.909 --> 07:07.211
What happened?
Was it bad?

07:07.211 --> 07:11.015
Apparently, Brayden,

07:11.048 --> 07:13.884
uh, took issue with Henry's
presentation to the class.

07:15.219 --> 07:17.421
He came up to him
afterwards and said...

07:19.557 --> 07:21.425
...that you were not
a credible hero.

07:21.458 --> 07:24.061
(sighs)
He said that the police

07:24.061 --> 07:25.863
are just regular people.

07:25.896 --> 07:27.565
That a lot of them
do bad things,

07:27.565 --> 07:29.934
and they get away with it,

07:29.967 --> 07:32.069
and that Henry should be

07:32.102 --> 07:34.038
more sensible

07:34.071 --> 07:35.405
in choosing who he looks up to.

07:35.439 --> 07:39.076
Oh. Great.

07:39.076 --> 07:41.411
Who did Brayden choose
as his hero?

07:41.445 --> 07:43.213
Spider-Man.

07:43.247 --> 07:45.249
(laughs): Oh, Jesus.

07:48.085 --> 07:49.887
-Did Henry sound okay?
-Yeah.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.422
I think he's fine.

07:54.124 --> 07:55.926
(sighs)

07:55.926 --> 07:57.795
He didn't tell me any of that.

08:00.264 --> 08:02.767
He just... tells you things?

08:02.767 --> 08:05.469
Yeah.
I mean, I was around

08:05.502 --> 08:07.772
the house a lot.
I... I babysat a lot.

08:09.974 --> 08:12.977
When me and Lily were still
together, she used to say that

08:13.010 --> 08:15.646
I was half his aunt,

08:15.680 --> 08:18.949
half big sister,
and half therapist.

08:18.983 --> 08:21.351
Lily wasn't very good at math.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.790
(sighs)
Yeah, you were there a lot.

08:29.860 --> 08:31.796
(sighs)

08:31.829 --> 08:34.599
I should've been there a lot.

08:34.632 --> 08:37.101
Well, that may be true,

08:37.134 --> 08:39.303
but it's not like
it's all on you.

08:39.303 --> 08:41.972
You know, Chip could've made
more of an effort, too.

08:46.476 --> 08:49.479
And you're here now.

08:49.479 --> 08:52.282
When all you want to do
is crawl in a hole,

08:52.316 --> 08:54.184
you're holding the world up
with both hands

08:54.218 --> 08:56.220
and signing up to raise
a seven-year-old boy.

08:58.823 --> 09:01.325
I'd like to see Spider-Man
try and pull that off.

09:09.066 --> 09:11.135
So, I spoke to Joe.

09:11.168 --> 09:13.804
We're officially reporting
it's been 72 hours

09:13.838 --> 09:15.505
since...

09:15.539 --> 09:18.676
Chase's trail ran cold.

09:18.709 --> 09:20.544
We're all set to meet with

09:20.577 --> 09:23.013
Hamzad's attorney tomorrow.

09:23.013 --> 09:24.348
She's gonna know we lost him.

09:26.016 --> 09:28.352
That's gonna be
an interesting conversation.

09:30.855 --> 09:33.991
You've got a good argument
to make.

09:34.024 --> 09:37.728
You can help them
get what they want.

09:37.762 --> 09:39.229
Once they understand
how much you know

09:39.263 --> 09:40.564
about Chase and his wife,

09:40.597 --> 09:42.099
they're gonna see
that they need you.

09:44.935 --> 09:46.536
What?

09:46.570 --> 09:49.439
The wife-- why are you
so interested in her?

09:51.742 --> 09:53.878
-What do you mean?
-When I talked about this

09:53.911 --> 09:55.880
with Waters, y...

09:55.913 --> 09:58.382
you had a reaction.

09:58.415 --> 10:01.018
Now she's on your mind again.

10:01.051 --> 10:02.386
Is there something I'm missing?

10:02.419 --> 10:04.889
There were three people involved

10:04.889 --> 10:07.191
when this whole thing started.

10:07.224 --> 10:10.194
You know, we keep talking
about the first two,

10:10.227 --> 10:13.430
but this woman might be
the invisible man in all this.

10:15.966 --> 10:18.235
Just seems like it might be
worth keeping an eye on her

10:18.235 --> 10:21.305
until we figure out
what we're missing.

10:26.744 --> 10:29.113
Is there anything
you knew about her

10:29.146 --> 10:31.081
that might be a piece
of an answer here?

10:34.118 --> 10:35.753
I don't know.

10:35.753 --> 10:37.922
I didn't know
very much about her.

10:37.922 --> 10:39.790
I was just aware of her.

10:39.824 --> 10:43.093
Aware of the gravity she exerted

10:43.127 --> 10:45.295
on objects around her.

10:46.764 --> 10:50.067
What she made men do.

10:50.100 --> 10:51.335
You know, it's late.

10:52.937 --> 10:55.472
It's gonna be
a rough day tomorrow.

10:55.505 --> 10:57.607
We should get some sleep.

10:58.809 --> 11:00.945
Do you mind setting
the alarm on your way out?

11:00.978 --> 11:02.612
Sure thing.

11:02.646 --> 11:04.281
-Good night, kiddo.
-Night.

11:04.314 --> 11:06.450
(footsteps climbing stairs)

11:13.290 --> 11:14.458
ANGELA:
Where are you?

11:14.491 --> 11:16.493
CHASE (over phone):
Colorado.

11:16.526 --> 11:19.629
Should be in L.A. tomorrow.
You okay?

11:19.663 --> 11:21.999
Yeah.

11:22.032 --> 11:24.001
Can I ask you a question?

11:24.034 --> 11:26.470
Shoot.

11:26.470 --> 11:29.139
So, we have a meeting tomorrow
with this woman,

11:29.173 --> 11:31.508
Nina Kruger.

11:31.541 --> 11:34.144
She represents Faraz Hamzad.

11:34.178 --> 11:36.613
Okay. Why?

11:36.646 --> 11:39.316
The assistant director
seems to believe

11:39.316 --> 11:42.319
that all this
is happening because...

11:42.352 --> 11:45.823
Hamzad wants
some kind of information.

11:45.856 --> 11:48.658
Something he thinks
you know, that...

11:48.692 --> 11:50.694
he wants to know.

11:50.727 --> 11:53.831
Wait, "we" have a meeting?
Why "we"?

11:53.864 --> 11:55.465
I'm going with him.

11:55.499 --> 11:57.667
What for?

11:57.701 --> 12:01.338
Don't you want to know what's
being said inside that room?

12:01.371 --> 12:04.674
Uh, not if it means
you being in danger.

12:04.674 --> 12:07.978
Emily, he is desperate
and he has failed,

12:08.012 --> 12:10.214
and I'm okay for him
to pay the price for it,

12:10.247 --> 12:12.382
but I don't want you
in the line of fire

12:12.416 --> 12:15.352
-when whatever happens to him
happens to him.
-Dad.

12:15.352 --> 12:18.188
-Stop.
-Oh, Em...

12:18.222 --> 12:19.689
My God. Okay.

12:19.689 --> 12:23.527
So, how are you doing?
Are you holding up?

12:23.527 --> 12:26.030
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

12:26.063 --> 12:29.666
-And Zoe?
-Uh, she's sleeping. She's fin.

12:29.699 --> 12:33.070
I think she gets this is how
it has to be for a while.

12:33.103 --> 12:37.041
Listen, can I say one more
thing about the other thing?

12:37.074 --> 12:39.043
Sure.

12:39.043 --> 12:41.912
This isn't some kind
of mystery, Em.

12:41.946 --> 12:44.915
The truth is,
at one point in his life,

12:44.949 --> 12:48.052
Faraz Hamzad thought
Mom belonged to him.

12:48.085 --> 12:49.854
He's got a grudge with me
for helping her

12:49.887 --> 12:51.755
do something about that.

12:51.788 --> 12:53.924
Everything else
is a distraction.

12:56.060 --> 12:57.928
You still there?

12:57.962 --> 13:00.264
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm still here.

13:01.598 --> 13:03.901
So, what do we do about this?

13:03.901 --> 13:05.870
Yeah, well, there-there
are people out there

13:05.903 --> 13:08.072
who've got grudges
against him as well.

13:08.105 --> 13:11.108
Once I get to L.A.,
I can use my company

13:11.141 --> 13:13.743
to get a man's attention
who has that grudge

13:13.777 --> 13:15.779
and might be willing
to do something about it.

13:17.814 --> 13:20.217
Okay.

13:20.250 --> 13:23.753
Stick with me, Emily.
We'll get through this.

13:23.787 --> 13:25.322
I know.

13:28.993 --> 13:31.595
I got to go.
Drive safe, okay?

13:31.595 --> 13:33.230
And, uh, give me a call
when you get in.

13:33.263 --> 13:35.765
All right, I will.
I love you.

13:35.799 --> 13:37.434
I love you, too, Dad.

13:42.940 --> 13:44.774
(dogs panting)

13:58.622 --> 14:00.624
I got you some stuff.

14:02.159 --> 14:03.994
Toothbrush,

14:04.028 --> 14:06.296
comb...

14:06.296 --> 14:08.298
Thought you might need

14:08.298 --> 14:10.467
some clothes.

14:11.969 --> 14:14.038
I just guessed on those.

14:18.875 --> 14:20.877
I'm Henry Dixon.

14:23.013 --> 14:25.315
Henry Dixon,

14:25.349 --> 14:28.652
he was an early investor
in an investment fund

14:28.652 --> 14:31.288
called Corsair Finance,

14:31.321 --> 14:33.190
which has done quite well
over the years.

14:34.524 --> 14:35.559
You...

14:38.328 --> 14:40.965
...you're Marcia Dixon.

14:40.998 --> 14:42.832
Henry's wife.

14:52.176 --> 14:54.344
We can change the picture
once we get there.

14:54.378 --> 14:57.147
The signature,
that's what's important.

14:57.181 --> 14:59.349
I want you to learn it.

14:59.349 --> 15:01.018
(sighs)
And once you get it down,

15:01.018 --> 15:02.552
I'm gonna transfer
some money to you

15:02.586 --> 15:05.022
using this name.

15:05.022 --> 15:06.690
I'm going to compensate you.

15:08.725 --> 15:11.728
Compensate you and then some.
A half a million dollars.

15:18.702 --> 15:20.037
Zoe?

15:28.878 --> 15:30.447
(engine starts)

15:39.756 --> 15:41.391
-(elevator bell chimes)
-(elevator doors open)

15:43.727 --> 15:44.794
CHASE:
Hey, Stuart.

15:47.131 --> 15:50.767
Oh, the drive was uneventful.
Yeah, thanks.

15:50.800 --> 15:54.238
Uh, just walking in now.

15:54.238 --> 15:56.406
Yeah, the place looks great.

15:56.440 --> 15:59.243
Yeah, thanks for, uh,
for doing the shopping.

16:01.078 --> 16:03.580
I don't... Yeah, I'm not
gonna be here for that long,

16:03.613 --> 16:05.215
but, uh, appreciate

16:05.249 --> 16:07.584
you thinking of me.

16:07.617 --> 16:09.786
Yeah, actually,
slight change of plans.

16:09.819 --> 16:12.256
Mrs. Dixon decided
to join me after all.

16:12.256 --> 16:14.091
(sliding glass door opens)

16:14.091 --> 16:17.061
Yeah, I want to keep
a low profile.

16:17.094 --> 16:18.928
You know, I'm just here for
that short meeting with Zach.

16:18.962 --> 16:21.598
Have-have you confirmed it yet?

16:21.631 --> 16:24.434
Oh, terrific,
lunch today, that's...

16:24.468 --> 16:26.403
Yeah, that's, uh...

16:26.436 --> 16:28.605
that's perfect, Stuart.
What time?

16:28.638 --> 16:30.774
Uh-huh.

16:30.774 --> 16:33.410
That's exactly what
I was hoping for.

16:33.443 --> 16:35.579
Yeah.

16:35.612 --> 16:37.281
What-what time?

16:40.016 --> 16:42.919
And where?

16:42.952 --> 16:45.255
Oh, all right, great.

16:45.289 --> 16:47.657
Thank you very much, Stuart.
Good work.

16:47.691 --> 16:50.127
All right, I'll see you then.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.795
Yeah.

16:51.795 --> 16:53.130
(cell phone clicks shut)

16:56.466 --> 16:57.467
(sighs)

17:00.670 --> 17:03.973
Yeah, the last time
I was here was with her,

17:03.973 --> 17:06.343
shortly after she was diagnosed.

17:13.317 --> 17:15.452
(sighs) Yeah, I...

17:15.485 --> 17:18.988
I figured that she'd have access
to better care here, you know,

17:18.988 --> 17:21.491
but, uh, it upset her too much.

17:23.160 --> 17:27.164
Being someplace unfamiliar,
someplace...

17:27.164 --> 17:29.633
you know,
without memories of Emily,

17:29.666 --> 17:31.235
so we went home.

17:50.887 --> 17:53.190
HAMZAD:
And the wise old man said,

17:53.190 --> 17:56.693
"Language,
by its nature, deceives.

17:59.696 --> 18:02.065
"Cloaks the truth in darkness..

18:04.734 --> 18:06.936
...rather than illuminate it."

18:13.042 --> 18:15.212
"Truth," said the wise old man,

18:15.245 --> 18:18.047
lives only in silence."

18:21.718 --> 18:24.421
When everyone is lying
about everything

18:24.454 --> 18:26.223
until they aren't
saying anything,

18:26.223 --> 18:28.258
then it's the truth.

18:28.292 --> 18:30.560
It's possible you
have missed the point.

18:30.594 --> 18:33.563
Oh, no, I got the point.
(clears throat)

18:33.597 --> 18:35.765
You are a little bit
full of shit.

18:35.799 --> 18:37.734
But in a fun way.

18:37.734 --> 18:39.068
(laughs)

23:21.918 --> 23:24.020
(typing)

23:29.392 --> 23:32.328
MIKE:
The difference between
here and gone is...

23:32.361 --> 23:35.098
hardly any difference at all.

23:49.713 --> 23:51.548
Few inches of Kevlar,

23:51.548 --> 23:53.382
broken rib,

23:53.416 --> 23:54.884
instead of a bullet
in the heart.

24:01.558 --> 24:03.593
You know, sometimes, I wonder f

24:03.627 --> 24:06.195
we've been too good
at this for too long.

24:06.229 --> 24:08.865
Maybe you might've forgotten
how it could all end

24:08.898 --> 24:10.266
if we're not careful.

24:11.901 --> 24:14.604
You think I'm unaware
of my mortality?

24:14.638 --> 24:16.940
I didn't say that.

24:16.973 --> 24:18.575
I'm not careful, then?

24:20.777 --> 24:23.412
You're not the one I'm worried
about not being careful.

24:25.414 --> 24:26.916
What are you trying to say?

24:30.587 --> 24:32.421
I'm saying either
Morgan Bote knew

24:32.455 --> 24:34.390
he was sending us into
a fucked-up situation

24:34.423 --> 24:35.592
when he gave the guy
your phone number...

24:36.926 --> 24:39.095
...or he didn't know.

24:39.128 --> 24:40.930
I'm not sure which one is worse.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.101
We need to know.

24:52.942 --> 24:54.611
(cell phone buzzes)

24:58.848 --> 25:01.517
-Hello?
-JULIAN: I'm calling
to conclude our conversation.

25:03.452 --> 25:04.921
Yeah.

25:04.954 --> 25:08.291
So, what's customary
in a situation like this,

25:08.324 --> 25:12.095
where the work was...
unfinished?

25:12.128 --> 25:14.764
Twenty percent.

25:14.798 --> 25:17.801
That's fine.
I'll see to it.

25:17.801 --> 25:20.136
But this concludes
our conversation, yes?

25:22.338 --> 25:25.141
I'd like to speak about
why the work was unfinished.

25:26.509 --> 25:27.677
All right.

25:29.713 --> 25:33.482
When I do a job,
I plan for everything.

25:33.516 --> 25:36.519
But I can't plan
for what I'm not told.

25:36.552 --> 25:38.454
You think I withheld
something from you?

25:38.487 --> 25:41.324
The target was
on his way out the door.

25:41.357 --> 25:42.859
What do you mean,
on his way out...

25:42.892 --> 25:46.495
Packed.
Ready to depart. Alert.

25:46.529 --> 25:48.331
Did he know I was coming?

25:53.670 --> 25:55.504
No, he-he couldn't have.

25:57.373 --> 26:00.076
Did he know the police
were coming soon behind me?

26:02.245 --> 26:05.014
Because either he's
the luckiest man in the world,

26:05.014 --> 26:06.182
or someone on your end
tipped him off

26:06.182 --> 26:08.184
that something was coming.

26:09.518 --> 26:11.354
I think you have a mole
in your operation.

26:12.588 --> 26:14.590
I need to understand
how you didn't know.

26:17.426 --> 26:20.229
Do you have any idea
who your mole might be?

26:31.708 --> 26:33.242
KRUGER:
Memorandum.

26:33.276 --> 26:35.211
Date, September the 10th.

26:35.244 --> 26:38.715
Subject, Harold Harper.

26:38.715 --> 26:40.684
There are brackets here,

26:40.717 --> 26:43.352
as this is just a template.

26:43.386 --> 26:46.589
It'll be distributed to
several people on Capitol Hill

26:46.622 --> 26:49.859
and across at least
four agencies.

26:49.893 --> 26:51.861
We are aware that
law enforcement has failed

26:51.895 --> 26:54.864
to apprehend the subject
known as Dan Chase.

26:54.898 --> 26:57.200
It has come to our attention
that Mr. Chase's escape

26:57.233 --> 26:59.202
was aided and abetted by

26:59.235 --> 27:01.570
the FBI assistant director
for counter-intelligence,

27:01.604 --> 27:03.539
Harold Harper.

27:03.572 --> 27:06.075
Through at least
one phone interaction,

27:06.109 --> 27:08.244
as well as further subversion f

27:08.244 --> 27:09.879
and interference with

27:09.913 --> 27:12.916
law enforcement's efforts.

27:12.916 --> 27:15.418
I was authorized to send this

27:15.418 --> 27:18.587
before Mr. Waters
contacted my office to say that

27:18.587 --> 27:21.390
you may have something
to say worth hearing.

27:21.424 --> 27:24.293
If that is the case,

27:24.327 --> 27:26.896
I think you should say it.

27:26.930 --> 27:28.965
I can get your client
the answers

27:28.998 --> 27:30.967
he's looking for.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.270
In fact, I may be
the only one who can.

27:34.270 --> 27:36.472
Answers?

27:36.505 --> 27:39.075
What kind of answers
do you imagine

27:39.108 --> 27:40.977
my client is looking for?

27:41.010 --> 27:42.979
HARPER:
That's where you're
gonna have to help me.

27:43.012 --> 27:44.814
I'm not sure yet.

27:47.116 --> 27:48.785
I don't know what
you're talking about.

27:48.818 --> 27:50.920
Chase had a relationship

27:50.954 --> 27:52.956
with your client

27:52.956 --> 27:55.658
and with your client's
first wife.

27:55.691 --> 27:58.294
I was there.
I observed it

27:58.294 --> 28:01.330
from afar, but in real time.

28:01.364 --> 28:04.633
So, I know as much
about this as anyone does.

28:04.633 --> 28:07.170
If I knew what
he was looking for,

28:07.203 --> 28:10.339
I could very likely
help him find it.

28:12.141 --> 28:14.978
Mr. Harper, for ten years,

28:14.978 --> 28:18.347
I have represented Mr. Hamzad's
interests in the U.K.,

28:18.381 --> 28:21.150
the U.S.,
across all of the Americas.

28:21.150 --> 28:23.286
I am intimately involved

28:23.319 --> 28:24.988
in his interests,

28:25.021 --> 28:27.490
in his family's investments.

28:27.523 --> 28:31.494
I'm afforded access to his
most sensitive information.

28:31.494 --> 28:33.997
And the idea that
he's involved in

28:34.030 --> 28:37.834
some kind of information
gathering exercise,

28:37.867 --> 28:40.303
that there are answers
he seeks, for which...

28:40.336 --> 28:43.139
I don't even know the questions,

28:43.172 --> 28:45.541
is not very likely.

28:48.344 --> 28:51.014
Mr. Hamzad's concerns

28:51.014 --> 28:53.582
will be communicated
to the necessary parties...

28:55.384 --> 28:57.854
...by the close of business.

28:57.887 --> 28:59.355
Good day.

29:03.392 --> 29:05.761
Her name was Belour Daadfar.

29:08.031 --> 29:09.032
KRUGER:
Excuse me?

29:09.032 --> 29:11.234
Hamzad's wife.

29:12.768 --> 29:15.438
That was her name
before they were married.

29:24.213 --> 29:26.249
Did you know that?

29:27.884 --> 29:30.219
He met her in Kabul,
in the city.

29:30.219 --> 29:32.755
She wasn't much liked
amongst his inner circle,

29:34.723 --> 29:37.060
But his love for her
was so great,

29:37.060 --> 29:39.762
his respect for her mind

29:39.795 --> 29:41.264
so deep

29:41.297 --> 29:44.733
that he considered her
his most trusted advisor

29:44.733 --> 29:47.403
during the campaign
against the Soviets,

29:47.403 --> 29:49.873
until she betrayed him

29:49.906 --> 29:53.409
and left him for the man
that we're calling Dan Chase,

29:53.409 --> 29:55.578
but who, back then,

29:55.611 --> 29:58.247
went by the name
of Johnny Kohler.

30:00.149 --> 30:03.319
He hasn't told you
any of this, has he?

30:07.423 --> 30:09.926
You know what
he's allowed you to know.

30:11.494 --> 30:14.063
But maybe I know some things
that go beyond that.

30:14.097 --> 30:17.967
I know the things that happened
before it all went wrong.

30:18.001 --> 30:19.602
I have insight.

30:21.437 --> 30:22.505
Call him.

30:24.107 --> 30:26.109
Tell him not to waste it.

30:36.852 --> 30:38.955
In a couple of hours,
it'll be his morning.

30:40.823 --> 30:43.459
Wait in the bar downstairs.
I'll find you.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.302
*

32:33.602 --> 32:35.404
(thunder rumbling)

32:48.417 --> 32:50.453
(indistinct shouting)

33:45.308 --> 33:46.642
(grunts)

34:10.666 --> 34:12.501
(muffled grunting)

34:28.884 --> 34:30.686
(muffled straining)

34:59.915 --> 35:01.784
*

35:26.975 --> 35:29.077
(choking)

35:52.968 --> 35:54.937
(music playing over radio)

35:54.970 --> 35:56.772
(indistinct shouting outside)

36:24.132 --> 36:26.134
*

36:32.040 --> 36:34.142
(grunting)

36:57.866 --> 36:59.335
(whines)

36:59.368 --> 37:01.470
What?

37:01.504 --> 37:02.505
(barks)

37:02.538 --> 37:04.039
What?

37:05.240 --> 37:07.042
What do you want from me?

37:08.844 --> 37:10.679
Oh.

37:10.679 --> 37:12.515
Shit.
(chuckles softly)

37:12.548 --> 37:14.016
Sorry.

37:21.223 --> 37:23.359
Why am I apologizing to you?

37:25.561 --> 37:28.564
I was kidnapped,
and now I am apologizing

37:28.597 --> 37:31.700
to you
for not doing a better job

37:31.734 --> 37:33.536
of seeing to your needs.

37:34.937 --> 37:36.238
Out loud.

37:43.045 --> 37:44.613
Fuck this.

37:47.049 --> 37:49.051
...um, doesn't mean it's gonna
take the same amount of time

37:49.084 --> 37:52.087
to get twice as hot,
if that makes sense.

37:52.120 --> 37:54.222
(sizzling)

37:57.125 --> 37:59.395
Holy mother. All right.

37:59.395 --> 38:01.697
-(phone ringing)
-Let's take a temp.

38:01.730 --> 38:03.065
Go in there.

38:03.098 --> 38:04.733
Oh, my God.

38:06.935 --> 38:08.704
Hold on.

38:08.737 --> 38:11.073
That's better. Okay.
I was close to the bone,

38:11.106 --> 38:13.576
and it was going to 125.
(chuckles)

38:14.777 --> 38:16.579
-Hello?
-STUART: Mrs. Dixon?

38:18.781 --> 38:20.616
Uh, sure.

38:20.649 --> 38:22.250
Who is this?

38:22.250 --> 38:24.587
It's Stuart,
Mr. Dixon's assistant.

38:25.754 --> 38:27.623
I just want to say
if you need anything,

38:27.656 --> 38:29.257
please don't hesitate to ask.

38:29.257 --> 38:31.427
I know we've never actually me,

38:31.427 --> 38:34.430
but we all consider you to be
family here at the company,

38:34.430 --> 38:37.265
so, really, anything at all.

38:39.668 --> 38:40.903
Mrs. Dixon?

38:40.936 --> 38:44.139
Uh, no. No, I think I can...

38:44.172 --> 38:45.941
handle everything myself.

38:45.941 --> 38:47.275
Thank you.

38:58.654 --> 39:00.523
(indistinct chatter)

39:02.791 --> 39:03.959
ZACHARY:
Henry.

39:04.960 --> 39:06.462
Zachary.

39:08.130 --> 39:09.465
ZACHARY:
You been waiting long?

39:09.498 --> 39:11.500
CHASE:
Yeah.

39:11.534 --> 39:14.302
-Almost a half hour.
-(exhales) Sorry about that.

39:14.336 --> 39:16.672
I had a call run long
with Sacramento. Just...

39:16.705 --> 39:18.106
You know how it goes.

39:18.140 --> 39:19.642
-Mm.
-It's great

39:19.675 --> 39:21.477
to finally meet you in person.
We're way overdue.

39:21.510 --> 39:24.647
-Ah.
-You know, we have a connection,

39:24.680 --> 39:26.014
actually, that
you may not know about.

39:26.048 --> 39:27.483
Oh, is that so?

39:27.516 --> 39:30.719
My mother is Julia Lewis.

39:31.987 --> 39:34.790
She was the receptionist
when the company first started.

39:34.823 --> 39:36.158
Oh, how about that.

39:36.191 --> 39:38.326
You know, my mom told me

39:38.360 --> 39:39.795
when she got pregnant with me,

39:39.828 --> 39:41.864
the managing partner
wanted to let her go,

39:41.897 --> 39:44.332
but you stepped in
and shut him down.

39:44.332 --> 39:46.334
-Mm.
-A single mom

39:46.334 --> 39:47.670
in this city.
(chuckles)

39:47.670 --> 39:50.506
Yeah, I'm sure there's a...
(sighs)

39:50.506 --> 39:52.841
study somewhere that says
that I wouldn't be here

39:52.841 --> 39:53.909
if it wasn't for you.

39:57.179 --> 40:00.182
So, listen, there's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

40:00.182 --> 40:01.650
Of course.
What's up?

40:01.684 --> 40:03.552
Uh, there's a play
I want to make.

40:03.586 --> 40:06.188
Arslon Mining and Metallurgy.

40:06.188 --> 40:08.023
Okay.
What kind of play?

40:08.023 --> 40:10.526
Well, equity investment.

40:10.526 --> 40:12.360
Something that
gets the attention

40:12.360 --> 40:15.363
of their director general,
Suleyman Pavlovich.

40:16.264 --> 40:19.702
Central Asian geological.

40:19.702 --> 40:21.537
Can't say
I'm super familiar with it,

40:21.570 --> 40:23.506
but certainly worth a study.

40:23.539 --> 40:25.373
Why don't we have the guys
at the end of the hall

40:25.373 --> 40:27.209
do some research, put together

40:27.209 --> 40:28.243
-a presentation,
and we can see...
-I'd prefer to move

40:28.276 --> 40:30.345
a lot faster than that.

40:30.378 --> 40:32.715
About how much faster
would you like to move?

40:32.715 --> 40:34.282
Today.

40:36.384 --> 40:38.721
I could live with tomorrow.

40:41.590 --> 40:43.125
Henry.

40:44.126 --> 40:46.294
Yes, Zach?

40:47.796 --> 40:51.066
(sighs)

40:51.066 --> 40:53.602
Uh, that's an awfully risky
position to take.

40:55.070 --> 40:58.073
Do you have some information
you could share with me

40:58.106 --> 41:00.743
-that might help me
make sense of it?
-Pavlovich.

41:00.776 --> 41:03.912
This is a guy
who has a lot of relationships,

41:03.912 --> 41:06.214
a lot of history in the region.

41:06.248 --> 41:08.250
I want a relationship with him,

41:08.250 --> 41:10.085
and this is the way
I'd like to start it.

41:12.788 --> 41:14.890
Look...

41:14.923 --> 41:18.393
I know the first two big plays
the company made

41:18.426 --> 41:20.295
were these big, wild swings--

41:20.328 --> 41:21.964
they may have even been
your ideas.

41:21.997 --> 41:23.732
Mm.
Yeah, they were. Yeah.

41:23.766 --> 41:25.634
And that's great.

41:25.668 --> 41:27.770
And we wouldn't be here
without them.

41:28.937 --> 41:30.806
But money...

41:30.839 --> 41:33.275
See, money grows up, too.

41:33.275 --> 41:34.910
It wants to be comfortable.

41:34.943 --> 41:37.445
Gets picky about
the company it keeps.

41:37.479 --> 41:39.114
Hmm.
Yeah, to be honest,

41:39.114 --> 41:42.117
I wasn't looking for advice
on this.

41:42.150 --> 41:45.621
I want you to start putting
the wheels in motion, Zach.

41:51.293 --> 41:53.128
Ooh, the turkey sandwich
is really good.

42:00.836 --> 42:02.638
(people shouting in Dari)

42:03.305 --> 42:04.940
(grunting)

42:04.973 --> 42:06.975
*

42:27.062 --> 42:29.164
*

42:40.342 --> 42:42.711
You thought
this would be a gift to him.

42:44.012 --> 42:45.981
A bird left on our doorstep

42:46.014 --> 42:48.984
to prove your loyalty to him.

42:49.017 --> 42:52.254
Or maybe to demonstrate
something else to me.

42:54.522 --> 42:56.258
Until this moment...

42:58.226 --> 43:01.029
...he was so full of promise.

43:01.063 --> 43:03.365
After it,

43:03.365 --> 43:06.201
what a monster he will become.

43:09.938 --> 43:11.406
So monstrous,

43:11.439 --> 43:14.176
you and I
will become monsters ourselves

43:14.209 --> 43:16.211
in order to escape him.

43:21.884 --> 43:23.719
That won't happen.

43:25.888 --> 43:27.723
I don't have that in me.

43:29.892 --> 43:32.060
If I ever loved you,

43:32.094 --> 43:34.562
that was why.

43:34.596 --> 43:37.632
I believed
you actually believe that.

43:44.907 --> 43:47.209
Suleyman Pavlovich.

43:47.242 --> 43:50.145
The beginning of the end.

43:52.147 --> 43:54.717
Don't blame yourself.

43:54.750 --> 43:57.720
The world is full of monsters.

43:57.753 --> 44:02.290
Sooner or later,
we all take our turn.

44:18.473 --> 44:20.743
(loud crunching)

44:20.776 --> 44:22.277
-(music playing quietly)
-(indistinct conversations)

44:37.359 --> 44:38.660
(slurps)

44:43.832 --> 44:45.633
Do you know what misophonia is?

44:46.835 --> 44:49.972
-Huh?
-Misophonia.

44:50.005 --> 44:53.475
M-I-S-O-P-H-O-N-I-A.

44:53.508 --> 44:55.343
Look it up.

45:05.653 --> 45:07.489
"In which...

45:07.489 --> 45:09.357
"In which certain sounds

45:09.391 --> 45:12.694
"trigger an emotional
and a physiological response

45:12.727 --> 45:16.164
"such as anger, panic or mania.

45:16.198 --> 45:18.666
Common sounds include..."

45:18.700 --> 45:20.502
Yep.

45:23.371 --> 45:25.808
-So right now, you're...
-Yeah.

45:25.841 --> 45:28.343
-Anger or...
-That's the one.

45:34.016 --> 45:36.251
(slurps)

45:38.720 --> 45:41.356
Okay.
You know what?

45:41.356 --> 45:43.525
I'm-I'm just gonna say it.

45:43.525 --> 45:45.861
This-this feels like a-like a
big moment for us.

45:45.894 --> 45:48.063
Does it?

45:48.096 --> 45:50.833
We've reached the stage where
we can confide in each other.

45:50.866 --> 45:53.035
-Mm.
-So, takes years
for some people.

45:53.068 --> 45:54.569
It's a big milestone.

45:56.204 --> 45:58.006
Maybe we're even past the point
of digging around

45:58.040 --> 46:00.375
for dirt on each other
behind each other's backs.

46:03.378 --> 46:05.413
Find anything interesting on me?

46:06.915 --> 46:09.217
-Not really.
-Mm.

46:14.222 --> 46:15.924
Did you find anything on me?

46:15.958 --> 46:18.393
-Not a whole hell of a lot, no.
-Mm.

46:19.627 --> 46:21.429
There is one story
I heard, though.

46:22.898 --> 46:25.033
But I hesitate to repeat it

46:25.067 --> 46:27.769
'cause it lacks
the ring of truth.

46:27.802 --> 46:29.571
But I-but I'm gonna repeat it

46:29.571 --> 46:31.373
'cause I-I'm just...
I'm curious,

46:31.406 --> 46:33.241
and I got to know.

46:34.910 --> 46:37.946
I heard
you assaulted a supervisor.

46:42.951 --> 46:44.452
Is it true?

46:45.620 --> 46:46.955
Yeah.

46:47.923 --> 46:50.292
What'd you do?

46:50.325 --> 46:52.160
I punched him in the face.

46:53.261 --> 46:54.796
Oh.

46:54.829 --> 46:57.299
-Was he eating almonds?
-(chuckles)

46:58.800 --> 47:00.668
No.

47:02.104 --> 47:04.272
He kept calling me Freckles.

47:06.108 --> 47:07.609
Now you lost me.

47:13.781 --> 47:15.283
(sighs)

47:15.317 --> 47:17.452
I never really knew my mom.

47:17.452 --> 47:20.455
I mean, she was there.
Every day.

47:20.455 --> 47:23.658
All the time. But, uh...

47:23.691 --> 47:26.428
it just always felt like
a piece of her was...

47:26.461 --> 47:28.263
was missing.

47:28.296 --> 47:30.832
Like there was another life
she had given up

47:30.865 --> 47:34.836
in exchange for this one,
so she was always...

47:34.869 --> 47:36.138
hollow.

47:38.806 --> 47:40.808
So, I made an oath to myself

47:40.808 --> 47:42.310
that I would never
end up like that.

47:42.310 --> 47:44.479
That I would find
something meaningful,

47:44.512 --> 47:47.815
and then I would work hard
until my fingers bled

47:47.849 --> 47:49.317
to get good at it.

47:49.317 --> 47:50.652
And I did.

47:53.355 --> 47:55.123
And then here comes
this motherfucker

47:55.157 --> 47:57.692
who wants everyone to know
that he thinks it's so funny

47:57.725 --> 47:59.361
that I don't seem
like I belong here.

48:02.364 --> 48:03.698
But I belong here.

48:05.400 --> 48:07.235
So I just wanted him
to know that.

48:13.175 --> 48:14.709
You get in trouble?

48:15.910 --> 48:17.412
I was terminated.

48:20.182 --> 48:22.650
But you're still here.

48:22.684 --> 48:25.020
Because five minutes
after I was terminated,

48:25.020 --> 48:26.854
my supervisor's boss

48:26.854 --> 48:29.391
threatened to walk out the door
right behind me.

48:32.394 --> 48:35.363
-Your boss's boss.
-Mm.

48:35.397 --> 48:37.432
Harold Harper?

48:44.372 --> 48:46.374
KRUGER:
I am fairly adept

48:46.408 --> 48:49.177
at anticipating
how Mr. Hamzad will react

48:49.211 --> 48:52.380
to a given piece
of upsetting news.

48:52.380 --> 48:54.216
What makes him frustrated.

48:54.216 --> 48:56.051
What makes him angry.

48:56.051 --> 48:58.553
What makes him
want to cause damage and pain

48:58.586 --> 49:01.456
to whatever or whomever
has upset him.

49:03.225 --> 49:05.427
I assumed,
when I called him just now,

49:05.460 --> 49:08.263
I would get one of the above.
Or worse.

49:10.432 --> 49:13.435
His actual reaction was...

49:13.468 --> 49:15.803
somewhat more complicated
than that.

49:21.309 --> 49:24.779
In one hour, there will be
a plane prepared to depart.

49:24.812 --> 49:28.416
If you want to further engage
on this issue,

49:28.450 --> 49:30.618
you will be on it.

49:32.087 --> 49:34.222
No... No, no, no, no, no.

49:34.256 --> 49:36.424
-No.
-HARPER: Hang on. Is he

49:36.458 --> 49:38.760
confirming that
my assertion is correct--

49:38.760 --> 49:41.629
that he's after
some kind of information?

49:41.663 --> 49:43.598
I don't believe
he's confirming anything.

49:45.767 --> 49:48.303
You can't seriously
be considering this.

49:48.336 --> 49:50.772
(sighs)
I'm not sure I understand

49:50.805 --> 49:53.275
what it is exactly
that I'm considering.

49:53.308 --> 49:54.909
If I get on this plane,

49:54.942 --> 49:57.079
he will engage
with me, personally--

49:57.112 --> 49:59.281
-is this what we're saying here?
-KRUGER: Let me be very clear

49:59.314 --> 50:01.483
about what it is I am saying

50:01.516 --> 50:04.652
as I am authorized
to say this and no more.

50:04.686 --> 50:08.090
If you are on that plane
when it takes off,

50:08.123 --> 50:11.359
Mr. Hamzad will consider
this conversation ongoing.

50:12.794 --> 50:14.162
If you are not,

50:14.196 --> 50:15.830
he will distribute
the memorandum

50:15.863 --> 50:17.499
laying the blame at your feet

50:17.532 --> 50:20.368
for everything
that has transpired.

50:31.213 --> 50:32.347
(door opens, closes)

50:54.068 --> 50:55.403
(line ringing)

50:56.371 --> 50:58.140
-CHASE: Hey, kid.
-Hey.

50:58.173 --> 51:01.042
Hey, I'm just on the way back
to apartment. What's up?

51:01.075 --> 51:03.345
I just got out of the meeting
with the lawyer.

51:03.378 --> 51:05.347
Faraz Hamzad
wants the assistant director

51:05.380 --> 51:07.349
to get on a plane,
and he's gonna do it.

51:07.382 --> 51:09.517
A plane?
To where?

51:09.517 --> 51:12.687
We don't know where
or what for, exactly,

51:12.720 --> 51:14.021
but it definitely
proves the theory

51:14.055 --> 51:16.057
that what Hamzad wants
out of all of this

51:16.090 --> 51:19.694
-is just some kind
of information.
-(sighs)

51:19.694 --> 51:21.663
Emily, please tell me
you aren't planning

51:21.696 --> 51:23.064
to be on that plane with him.

51:23.097 --> 51:24.532
I don't think I have a choice.

51:24.532 --> 51:26.901
You absolutely have a choice.

51:26.934 --> 51:28.736
No, I don't.

51:30.438 --> 51:32.540
He's starting to get suspicious
about me.

51:32.540 --> 51:34.876
Suspicious?
Wh-What do you mean?

51:34.909 --> 51:37.879
Oh, shit. Em, why didn't you
say anything about this before?

51:37.879 --> 51:39.547
And if I abandon him now,

51:39.581 --> 51:41.883
at this moment,
with everything that's at stake,

51:41.883 --> 51:43.551
he's going to know
that something's off

51:43.551 --> 51:45.720
because that's just not
something that I would do.

51:45.753 --> 51:47.054
-Not something who would do?
-(sniffles)

51:47.054 --> 51:50.091
You? Or Angela?

51:54.929 --> 51:56.964
I don't know.

52:01.803 --> 52:03.571
I'm starting to forget
what the difference is.

52:07.575 --> 52:09.777
I think
I'm coming apart here, Dad.

52:09.811 --> 52:11.913
Emily, listen to me, now.

52:11.913 --> 52:13.748
-Here's what I want you to do.
-(sniffles)

52:13.781 --> 52:15.883
Dump this phone,

52:15.917 --> 52:18.085
burn whatever you have to
and leave.

52:18.119 --> 52:19.754
You know where to go.

52:19.787 --> 52:22.757
Don't say it out loud.
Don't tell anyone.

52:22.790 --> 52:24.426
And I'll meet you there.

52:27.429 --> 52:29.231
No.

52:29.264 --> 52:30.932
Em, I'm not messing around her.

52:30.965 --> 52:32.400
This is serious.

52:32.434 --> 52:34.602
I've worked too hard for this.

52:34.602 --> 52:37.104
I've sacrificed
too much for this.

52:37.104 --> 52:39.073
I'm good at this.

52:39.106 --> 52:40.808
If I walk away now, then...

52:40.842 --> 52:43.177
then it just is all gone.

52:44.446 --> 52:45.980
And then I'll have no idea

52:46.013 --> 52:47.949
what the hell I even am
at that point.

52:47.949 --> 52:49.116
Emily, you know who you are.

52:49.116 --> 52:50.285
Everything was fine.

52:50.318 --> 52:53.321
I was fine.

52:53.355 --> 52:55.957
Until I heard
Faraz Hamzad's name.

52:55.990 --> 52:58.626
Do you have a plan
for how to handle all of this?

52:58.660 --> 53:00.462
Yeah, I do, I do.

53:00.495 --> 53:03.498
And at the end of this plan,
is he still alive?

53:07.134 --> 53:09.871
Because I don't think I'm gonna
be okay until he's gone.

53:11.306 --> 53:13.641
I don't think I'll have any idea

53:13.675 --> 53:16.478
who I am until he's gone.

53:18.380 --> 53:20.114
So, please,

53:20.147 --> 53:22.817
the sooner the better.

53:26.654 --> 53:28.122
And in the meantime,
I have to do this.

53:28.155 --> 53:29.657
Emily, no.

53:29.657 --> 53:31.493
-I love you, Dad.
-E-Emily.

53:35.162 --> 53:36.698
(exhales)

53:40.034 --> 53:42.069
(toilet flushes)

53:54.349 --> 53:55.550
WATERS:
You understand why I can't

53:55.583 --> 53:57.184
follow you
onto that plane, yeah?

53:57.218 --> 53:58.886
I've got people to answer to.

53:58.920 --> 54:01.188
This is no longer within
a country mile of my assignment.

54:01.188 --> 54:02.857
HARPER:
No, I understand.

54:04.058 --> 54:06.928
WATERS:
All right, listen, listen.
I, uh...

54:09.864 --> 54:12.199
This is strange
and uncomfortable territory

54:12.199 --> 54:15.036
I'm about to venture into.

54:15.069 --> 54:18.540
I'm curious as a motherfucker,
but I do not get involved.

54:18.573 --> 54:20.908
Right?
Involved is...

54:20.942 --> 54:23.378
well, it's for people who should
take better care of themselves.

54:25.046 --> 54:26.381
But this one...

54:27.715 --> 54:30.017
...she is one of the good ones.

54:30.051 --> 54:32.253
She would walk
into a burning building for you.

54:32.286 --> 54:33.755
And for the life of me, I just,

54:33.788 --> 54:35.122
I can't understand
why you would let her.

54:37.124 --> 54:38.960
Do you have kids, Ray?

54:42.430 --> 54:45.099
No. No, I do not.

54:45.132 --> 54:48.570
One day, if you do,

54:48.603 --> 54:52.907
when the time comes
for them to break your heart,

54:52.907 --> 54:55.777
remember I told you this.

54:55.810 --> 54:57.745
The moment you let them in...

54:58.980 --> 55:01.483
...you were asking for it.

55:13.795 --> 55:15.497
(engine whirring up)

55:29.444 --> 55:31.178
(silverware clinking softly)

55:40.955 --> 55:43.290
I ordered in.

55:48.496 --> 55:50.632
Should we eat?

55:53.034 --> 55:54.201
ZOE:
How was today?

55:58.806 --> 56:01.676
It's gonna be fine.

56:01.709 --> 56:03.377
ZOE:
Well, that's good.

56:09.717 --> 56:12.820
Actually, it doesn't
sound all that good.

56:12.854 --> 56:15.690
-Yeah.
-Sounds like it
could have gone better.

56:15.723 --> 56:17.525
Yeah, it could have.

56:22.329 --> 56:24.499
I was about to apologize again.

56:24.532 --> 56:26.868
(chuckles)
What for? It's not your fault.

56:26.901 --> 56:28.970
I know it isn't.

56:29.003 --> 56:30.738
It's just a hard habit to break.

56:41.182 --> 56:43.217
(Chase grunts)

56:50.925 --> 56:52.927
What's that?

56:55.897 --> 56:57.699
It's a letter

56:57.732 --> 57:00.702
from Marcia Dixon.

57:00.735 --> 57:03.237
It's addressed to the...

57:03.270 --> 57:05.039
board of Corsair Finance.

57:06.708 --> 57:08.175
(clears throat) It gives notice
of her intent to enter

57:08.209 --> 57:10.745
into divorce proceedings
against her husband.

57:17.218 --> 57:19.386
What are you doing?

57:21.889 --> 57:23.591
It doesn't sound like
you've ever been

57:23.625 --> 57:24.926
through a divorce before.
(chuckles softly)

57:27.128 --> 57:28.563
I learned a lot from mine.

57:30.397 --> 57:32.567
I kept thinking that if
I understood the rules better,

57:32.600 --> 57:33.935
I could protect myself.

57:36.137 --> 57:38.405
Turns out that's not
what the rules are for.

57:40.241 --> 57:42.577
But I think Marcia has

57:42.610 --> 57:44.812
a little bit more leverage
than I did.

57:46.614 --> 57:50.417
If I understand the situation,
this letter would cause

57:50.451 --> 57:52.419
a real mess at your company.

57:53.955 --> 57:56.290
Audits, discovery.

57:56.323 --> 57:58.125
The fear of what I might
ask for in a divorce.

57:58.159 --> 58:00.227
The fear of what I might get.

58:00.261 --> 58:03.598
So you'd just kind of be
"that guy" to them for a while.

58:03.598 --> 58:05.933
The guy they keep
at arm's length

58:05.933 --> 58:10.104
unless they want to end up
in depositions, so...

58:10.137 --> 58:12.106
it would make it
almost impossible for you

58:12.106 --> 58:14.809
-to accomplish anything there...
-What the fuck are you doing?

58:14.842 --> 58:16.911
I didn't send it yet.

58:16.944 --> 58:21.315
I set it to send in two hours,
but I can log in and stop it.

58:27.321 --> 58:30.124
Maybe you're right,

58:30.157 --> 58:33.928
and I would be dead
if I hadn't come with you.

58:33.961 --> 58:35.462
Or maybe you're wrong,

58:35.462 --> 58:38.299
and this is nothing more
than a kidnapping.

58:38.299 --> 58:40.301
Maybe it's both.

58:40.301 --> 58:42.503
Either way, I'm here.

58:42.536 --> 58:45.973
And from here,
I see two ways forward.

58:47.875 --> 58:49.176
One...

58:52.213 --> 58:53.314
I stay.

58:55.482 --> 58:57.318
And I help you through this.

58:59.987 --> 59:01.522
(chuckles)
You're gonna help me?

59:01.555 --> 59:05.192
Yeah, I am.
I think you need it.

59:05.226 --> 59:07.294
Once upon a time,
I looked into the mirror

59:07.328 --> 59:09.864
and I didn't know who I was.

59:09.897 --> 59:12.499
I think you know what I felt.

59:12.533 --> 59:14.335
I think you can't remember

59:14.335 --> 59:17.338
what life felt like
before that feeling.

59:17.371 --> 59:18.973
And I believe your daughter.

59:19.006 --> 59:21.542
I believe the guy
she talked about

59:21.575 --> 59:24.378
is in there somewhere,
and I would like to help him.

59:24.411 --> 59:27.014
I never had anybody
help me when I was

59:27.014 --> 59:28.549
going through my experience,
and it nearly killed me,

59:28.582 --> 59:30.718
and that was
w-without having to do it

59:30.752 --> 59:32.153
-while running
for my life. (laughs)
-Zoe.

59:32.186 --> 59:35.356
Zoe, listen to me,
I'm gonna be fine.

59:35.389 --> 59:37.692
-This whole thing
is traumatizing...
-But-but if I do that for you,

59:37.725 --> 59:40.161
then you need to acknowledge

59:40.194 --> 59:41.595
that we're in this together.

59:43.197 --> 59:46.734
You need to make
a gesture to prove it.

59:48.936 --> 59:51.739
What kind of gesture
do you have in mind?

59:56.610 --> 59:59.213
Half of everything you own.

1:00:00.214 --> 1:00:03.250
Transferred to my name.

1:00:03.284 --> 1:00:06.688
Before 10:17,

1:00:06.721 --> 1:00:09.056
or the email goes out.

1:00:16.063 --> 1:00:17.732
What's two?

1:00:18.733 --> 1:00:20.868
Two?

1:00:20.902 --> 1:00:23.570
Well, two is that you give me
a reasonable amount of money

1:00:23.604 --> 1:00:25.907
for the train wreck
that you've turned my life into,

1:00:25.940 --> 1:00:27.709
and I stay silent
in this apartment

1:00:27.742 --> 1:00:29.076
-until it's safe
for me to leave,
-Wh... Whoa.

1:00:29.110 --> 1:00:30.912
and then I will.

1:00:30.912 --> 1:00:34.415
Theft.
Fucking extortion?

1:00:34.448 --> 1:00:35.750
What's this gonna cost me, huh?

1:00:35.750 --> 1:00:38.552
Half of everything you own.

1:00:38.585 --> 1:00:40.387
So it's not about money
until you choose

1:00:40.421 --> 1:00:41.956
-to make it about money.
-No, no, I said

1:00:41.989 --> 1:00:45.059
that money is not just money.

1:00:45.092 --> 1:00:47.128
What it always is

1:00:47.161 --> 1:00:49.931
is a measure of discomfort.

1:00:49.964 --> 1:00:52.934
H... How badly do I want this?

1:00:52.967 --> 1:00:55.970
How badly do I want
to avoid that?

1:00:56.003 --> 1:00:59.006
How much power do I have
to make it so?

1:01:01.108 --> 1:01:03.610
In this moment,

1:01:03.644 --> 1:01:05.479
I want to amount to more

1:01:05.512 --> 1:01:08.983
than just a complication
in your story.

1:01:09.016 --> 1:01:12.653
I want to know that
the next time we disagree,

1:01:12.686 --> 1:01:15.990
I have the resources
to make you think twice

1:01:16.023 --> 1:01:18.459
before threatening me

1:01:18.492 --> 1:01:22.163
or throwing me
in the trunk of a car

1:01:22.196 --> 1:01:24.799
or looking at me the wrong way

1:01:24.799 --> 1:01:26.667
to shut me up.

1:01:26.700 --> 1:01:28.936
I want to be accounted for.

1:01:28.970 --> 1:01:30.805
I have the resources
to make it so,

1:01:30.838 --> 1:01:32.673
so you will account for me.

1:01:34.175 --> 1:01:37.144
Do you have any idea

1:01:37.178 --> 1:01:40.181
the danger that
you're putting yourself in?

1:01:41.482 --> 1:01:43.851
The danger
that you're putting me in?

1:01:43.885 --> 1:01:45.219
My kid?

1:01:47.488 --> 1:01:49.490
You will account for me.

1:01:59.666 --> 1:02:01.502
*

1:04:17.138 --> 1:04:20.141
(rooster calls)

1:04:29.116 --> 1:04:31.285
You have no idea
how different the game is.

1:04:31.352 --> 1:04:33.120
-I imagined you were dead.
-(knife scrapes)

1:04:33.154 --> 1:04:34.555
(car screeches, crashes)

1:04:34.621 --> 1:04:35.957
DAN: No. Just retired.
