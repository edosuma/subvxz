WEBVTT

00:06.089 --> 00:09.468
The temperature was dropping.
It was getting late.

00:09.551 --> 00:12.638
But I wasn't about to give up.
And neither was Casey.

00:13.138 --> 00:15.724
A hiker had fallen into a deep ditch.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.726
He'd been there for hours.

00:17.809 --> 00:22.189
But the snowfall was so thick,
we never would've found him without Casey.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.024
That sounds amazing.

00:24.608 --> 00:27.110
No. It sounds horrible.

00:33.742 --> 00:37.079
Search and rescue is a serious
and sometimes dangerous job, Charles.

00:37.162 --> 00:40.916
-I hope my story didn't scare ya.
-I wasn't scared.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.835
I just don't like feeling trapped.

00:42.918 --> 00:45.212
And that was pretty much the point
of your story.

00:46.213 --> 00:50.425
Actually, I think Meg was trying to convey
what an amazing dog Casey is.

00:52.553 --> 00:56.306
-Looks like Casey can speak for herself.
-She loves it when we talk about her.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.559
I'm gonna check us into
the first aid seminar

00:58.642 --> 01:00.644
before all the good CPR dummies are taken.

01:00.727 --> 01:03.230
I'll be over in a minute.
And here's Scout.

01:06.191 --> 01:09.152
-She is so cute.
-Thanks for watching her.

01:09.236 --> 01:12.239
The family we placed her with
won't pick her up until next week.

01:12.322 --> 01:15.492
-Why can't she be a search and rescue dog?
-Scout's very intelligent,

01:15.576 --> 01:17.786
but she failed because
she couldn't stay focused.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.997
She seems pretty focused on me.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.292
Even though Scout can't save lives,
she makes up for it in cuteness.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.918
She definitely does.

01:26.044 --> 01:29.464
Hey, Meg. How would you feel about
bringing Casey to do a demonstration

01:29.548 --> 01:32.467
-for our school Safety Week?
-Doesn't your dad do it every year?

01:32.551 --> 01:35.387
That's the thing. The kids already know
all his jokes by heart.

01:35.470 --> 01:39.141
I'd love to. I'd never pass up a chance
to talk about how great my dog is.

01:51.612 --> 01:55.407
You know, I was afraid
of German shepherds when I was your age.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.201
But she is so friendly.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.119
No one could be afraid of you.

01:59.203 --> 02:01.663
That's why she can't be
a search and rescue dog.

02:01.747 --> 02:04.333
She was too busy playing
instead of focusing on her job.

02:04.416 --> 02:08.252
Which is honestly a little unfair.
I mean, she's still so young.

02:08.336 --> 02:12.132
So, I'm gearing up
for my Safety Week presentation.

02:12.216 --> 02:15.594
What do you think? Helmet? No helmet?

02:17.095 --> 02:20.140
You must hate being in your work clothes
when you're not at work.

02:20.224 --> 02:24.811
Yeah. It must be so embarrassing
giving a speech to a bunch of little kids.

02:25.312 --> 02:28.065
No. Wait, are you two embarrassed?

02:29.107 --> 02:32.819
You do know that firefighter is top three
on every coolest jobs list, right?

02:32.903 --> 02:35.113
Well, what if a fire breaks out

02:35.197 --> 02:37.616
and they need their bravest lieutenant
on the scene?

02:37.699 --> 02:39.701
-Yeah.
-Okay. Hold up.

02:39.785 --> 02:42.287
Is this because my hose
got tangled last year?

02:44.998 --> 02:48.669
-We asked Meg and Casey to replace you.
-Yeah.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.254
Ouch.

02:51.213 --> 02:55.425
We just think having a dog
in the presentation will be so cool.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.677
And Meg too.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.762
-Yeah.
-We're sorry, Dad.

02:59.805 --> 03:01.056
It's all good.

03:01.139 --> 03:05.269
After so many performances,
it is hard to keep it fresh anyways.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.281
One?

03:18.740 --> 03:21.118
-Or seven million?
-Just one.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.541
Are you sure you're okay
with Meg and Casey taking your place?

03:27.624 --> 03:32.129
Course I am. I get it.
Dogs, everything else.

03:32.713 --> 03:36.800
Also, it's hard to hear you talk
about going into fires and stuff.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.219
I don't like thinking about
you being scared.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.973
Being scared is part of the job.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.767
But I'll tell you
what helps me get through it.

03:45.851 --> 03:50.314
I think about what makes me happy,
and that's your mom and you two.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.900
What makes you feel happy?

03:55.986 --> 03:59.948
I guess puppies, and grown-up dogsâ€¦

04:01.408 --> 04:03.327
and Mom's Christmas chili.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.703
Yeah, there you go.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.417
Good night, Charles.

04:10.501 --> 04:14.505
-Dad, the door.
-Sorry. I forgot.

04:20.219 --> 04:23.514
Before we show off Casey's skills,
does anybody have any questions?

04:23.597 --> 04:25.724
Yes, a question
in the form of a statement.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.184
You didn't mention drones.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.561
Drones are the future
of search and rescue.

04:29.645 --> 04:33.232
Drones can locate stranded victims without
risking the safety of rescue teams.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.817
She's not here to talk
about drones, Russell.

04:35.901 --> 04:39.696
It's okay, Charles. Drones do have
an important part in search and rescue,

04:39.780 --> 04:41.990
but they can't do
what Casey's about to do.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.700
-Can I get a volunteer?
-Me!

04:43.784 --> 04:44.910
Hi, I'm Remy.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.538
-Pleased to meet you.
-Hi, Remy. Take this.

04:48.539 --> 04:49.623
It's lovely.

04:49.706 --> 04:53.168
Actually, I want you
to let Casey sniff the sweater

04:53.252 --> 04:55.045
-and she'll find its owner.
-Okay.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.341
Okay, Casey. Find.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.901
Good girl! You found me.

05:18.735 --> 05:19.736
Come on.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.535
Thanks for helping me out, Lizzie.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.954
Of course. That was so fun.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.915
You know, I'm available
for other demonstrations.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.750
-Any time at all.
-Likewise.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.463
How amazing is Casey?

05:38.547 --> 05:42.217
Yeah. Search and rescue dogs are great.
But so was the Pony Express.

05:42.301 --> 05:46.680
A RacerX drone with thermal imaging
would've found you in two seconds.

05:46.763 --> 05:50.267
Maybe, but dogs have an extra smell organ
that allows them to find things

05:50.350 --> 05:52.603
-with no odor at all.
-Drones can fly.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.521
Dogs can crawl under a fence.

05:54.605 --> 05:57.441
-Drones don't have to go to the vet.
-Dogs aren't annoying.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.985
I think drones and dogs
both have a lot of value.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.738
But dogs do provide companionship

06:02.821 --> 06:06.241
and look really cute
when they have one ear that flops down.

06:06.325 --> 06:08.076
Plus, you can't love a drone.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.412
Oh, really?

06:15.125 --> 06:16.376
Stay strong, Charles.

06:19.796 --> 06:23.175
Then Casey tracked me and practically
broke down the shed doors to find me.

06:23.258 --> 06:27.012
My group had to watch Thao's mom
stock a hurricane kit with homemade gorp.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.390
-The no-chocolate kind.
-No chocolate? No, thank you.

06:30.474 --> 06:33.602
I'm seriously considering a career
in search and rescue, like Meg.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.605
I get to travel, help people,
and work with dogs.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.398
That sounds perfect for you.

06:38.482 --> 06:43.195
Actually, might be perfect for us.
You work with the dogs, I'll travel.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.699
Hi, Charles. Hi, Scout.

06:47.783 --> 06:49.034
Come here, Scout.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.621
-Hi.
-She seems pretty focused now.

06:52.704 --> 06:55.999
I bet you could be
a search and rescue dog just like Casey.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.584
And you two could be a team.

06:59.795 --> 07:01.296
Let's give it a try.

07:03.715 --> 07:05.217
Smell.

07:05.843 --> 07:08.762
Okay, Charles. Now take Scout,
but don't let her see me.

07:08.846 --> 07:11.473
Sure. Come on, Scout.

07:12.891 --> 07:15.561
There's nothing more exciting
than a good experiment.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.402
Okay, sweetie. Now find. Find the slipper.

07:27.281 --> 07:30.242
I knew she could do it.
Look how happy she is.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.411
See? She can be a search and rescue dog.

07:32.494 --> 07:35.539
We've only got a week, but that's
plenty of time to prove it to Meg.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.082
So? How'd it go today?

07:37.165 --> 07:39.835
Did the kids cheer for Meg
or politely applaud?

07:39.918 --> 07:41.420
'Cause they always cheer for me.

07:41.503 --> 07:44.006
Honey, stop trying
to make the kids feel guilty.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.301
There's my slipper. Where'd you find it?

07:47.384 --> 07:48.468
It wasn't me.

07:55.392 --> 07:58.562
Drones vary in their range,
endurance and payload.

07:58.645 --> 08:02.816
Did you know a multi-rotor drone can have
up to eight rotors on the platform?

08:03.317 --> 08:05.819
Yeah. That sounds like a lot of rotors.

08:05.903 --> 08:07.613
Yes, it's eight.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.825
I was flying my drone by the park
yesterday and saw you walking your dog.

08:11.909 --> 08:13.035
She's not mine.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.913
We're just taking care of her
until she goes to her new home.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.498
We're training her
to do search and rescue like Casey.

08:18.582 --> 08:23.295
Why bother? By the time she finishes,
drone tech will be even more advanced.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.671
You know how I know that?

08:24.755 --> 08:27.716
Because drone tech
is always getting more advanced.

08:27.799 --> 08:32.304
Drones are not better than dogs,
on any planet, in any universe.

08:32.386 --> 08:36.183
Let's find out. I challenge you
to a drone versus dog competition.

08:36.265 --> 08:39.019
-I accept.
-You don't even know what it is yet.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.313
Neither do you. You just thought of it.

08:42.231 --> 08:45.484
Okay. We'll hide something
and see who finds it first,

08:45.567 --> 08:47.402
your dog or my drone.

08:47.486 --> 08:51.031
If my sister and I are training Scout,
I'm pretty sure I know who'll win.

08:51.114 --> 08:54.785
You're on. The park.
Saturday morning. 10:00 a.m.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.746
-I can't.
-I knew you'd chicken out.

08:57.829 --> 09:01.166
No. My dad makes pancakes
on Saturday mornings at 10:00.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.586
-11:00?
-I'll be there.

09:08.799 --> 09:11.051
Okay, Scout. You can do this.

09:11.134 --> 09:13.136
Your future is in your own paws.

09:13.220 --> 09:17.850
You're way better than any drone,
no matter how incredibly awesome it is.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.269
What? It is.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.400
Follow me, Scout.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.446
Come on, Scout. Come on.

09:36.118 --> 09:39.371
Okay, Scout. Sit. Sit.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.542
Nothing? Really?

09:46.879 --> 09:47.880
Come here, Scout.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.300
Scout, come here. Come here.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.390
Come on, Scout. It's okay.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.186
You can do it.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.573
-So, what now?
-We go back to square one.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.742
Scout wasn't good on the basic test,

10:16.825 --> 10:20.037
but she did great on the one
that matters most: tracking scent.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.874
-That's not Dad's slipper.
-It's Maria's. She's hiding.

10:24.499 --> 10:27.127
Okay, Scout.
You're gonna find Maria, right?

10:27.711 --> 10:29.755
Okay, make us proud. Find.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.218
Yes!

10:37.554 --> 10:41.767
No! Now we're back to, like,
square negative a thousand.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.146
Meg was right.
She's not a search and rescue dog.

10:46.230 --> 10:48.106
She just loves Dad's slipper.

10:48.607 --> 10:50.359
I don't know what's worse.

10:50.442 --> 10:53.779
That we were wrong about Scout
or that Russell gets to win.

10:53.862 --> 10:55.906
Definitely being wrong about Scout.

10:55.989 --> 10:59.076
Hey, Lizzie. Hey, Charles.
Hope you don't mind I let myself in.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.787
-Hey, Remy.
-So, big news.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.748
-My mom finally said I could get a puppy.
-That's great, Remy.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.792
But we don't have
any fosters at the moment.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.126
Then who's that?

11:08.210 --> 11:10.337
This is Scout, but she's not available.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.882
-She already has a family.
-Playing hardball, I see.

11:16.927 --> 11:22.474
Healthy coat. Sweet eyes.
And look at the size of those paws.

11:22.558 --> 11:24.977
She's gonna be really big
when she's full-grown.

11:27.563 --> 11:30.774
My mom says the dog has gotta fit
through the cat door,

11:30.858 --> 11:32.693
so that's gonna be a hard pass.

11:32.776 --> 11:33.986
I'm sorry.

11:37.114 --> 11:39.032
You gonna call Russell to forfeit?

11:39.116 --> 11:42.411
I think the mature thing to do
is talk to him in person.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.290
You just wanna play
with his drone, don't you?

11:46.373 --> 11:48.041
It's got eight rotors.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.253
Can I come out now?

11:51.336 --> 11:52.754
-Yeah.
-Yes.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.763
Is it a bird? Is it a plane?

12:01.847 --> 12:04.600
Is it the new Falconer 5000 drone?

12:05.184 --> 12:06.685
It's a drone, by the way.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.646
Looks like you're missing something.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.275
Scout woke up with a bad stomachache.

12:13.358 --> 12:16.570
She accidentally ate some potatoes.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.071
Dogs eat potatoes.

12:18.155 --> 12:21.617
In fact, it's a major ingredient
in most commercial dog food.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.076
Yeah, I know.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.747
-You're forfeiting, right?
-Yep.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.666
-You know that means I win, right?
-Yep.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.877
You wanna play with my drone, right?

12:32.503 --> 12:33.504
Totally.

12:37.341 --> 12:41.011
What about you?
You can still do search and rescue.

12:42.054 --> 12:43.055
I don't know.

12:43.639 --> 12:46.808
I think I was more excited about it
for Scout than for me.

12:47.768 --> 12:51.021
I feel bad for trying to force her
to be someone she's not.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.778
An obstacle course, huh?

12:57.861 --> 13:00.405
Actually, this is a failed experiment.

13:01.865 --> 13:04.743
I really thought Scout could make
a great search and rescue dog.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.329
If it makes you feel any better,
I thought so too.

13:07.412 --> 13:10.457
Thanks.
That does make me feel a little better.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.417
Are you here for Scout?

13:12.501 --> 13:15.337
Yeah, I know I'm early,
but her new family's ready for her.

13:15.420 --> 13:18.382
Is it okay if we maybe
drop her off a little later?

13:18.465 --> 13:21.260
-I know Charles will wanna say goodbye.
-Of course.

13:21.343 --> 13:23.470
Thanks for taking such good care of her.

13:23.971 --> 13:27.599
We should go find him. He was so excited
to play with Russell's drone,

13:27.683 --> 13:29.601
we don't know when he'll come back.

13:32.062 --> 13:36.567
It usually takes people years to acquire
this level of navigational prowess,

13:36.650 --> 13:38.360
but I've mastered it in mere months.

13:38.443 --> 13:39.778
Can I try?

13:40.362 --> 13:44.116
I'll say a reluctant yes, but be careful.

13:46.410 --> 13:49.329
Throttle's on the left,
pitch on your right. Use your thumb.

13:49.413 --> 13:54.042
My cousin Becky has one.
Yours is way easier to fly.

13:54.126 --> 13:55.627
Okay. My turn again.

13:55.711 --> 13:58.046
No. Just let me land it.

13:59.423 --> 14:00.591
Look what you did!

14:00.674 --> 14:02.676
You grabbed it out of my hand!

14:07.931 --> 14:10.475
First crash ever, thanks to you!

14:10.559 --> 14:12.978
Me? I was flying it really well.

14:13.061 --> 14:16.231
I'd climb up and get it,
but I'm not good with heights.

14:16.315 --> 14:19.484
Not that I ever needed to be,
because I had a drone.

14:22.738 --> 14:25.657
Come on. I bet there's a rake or something
in the shed.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.168
See. Told you.

14:42.132 --> 14:44.635
I can't open the door.
The latch must've dropped!

14:44.718 --> 14:46.887
What? We're locked in?

14:48.430 --> 14:50.057
I can't believe it.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.558
What are we gonna do now?

14:53.977 --> 14:55.562
I-- I don't know.

14:57.648 --> 15:02.569
-Help! Help! Help!
-Help! Help! Help!

15:03.153 --> 15:04.404
We're the only ones here.

15:04.488 --> 15:07.991
Yeah. I don't even see a drone in the sky.
Where are they?

15:09.952 --> 15:11.161
Lizzie.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.997
Okay. Now I'm worried.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.290
Charles!

15:17.626 --> 15:19.753
Not now, Scout. This isn't tug-of-war.

15:19.837 --> 15:21.088
What is she doing?

15:21.797 --> 15:23.799
I-- Scout, get back here!

15:30.013 --> 15:31.932
I wish we had a flashlight.

15:32.808 --> 15:36.937
The drone has night vision,
but that won't help us now.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.981
What if no one finds us?

15:41.108 --> 15:42.442
Someone will.

15:43.402 --> 15:44.862
You know, when I'm scared,

15:44.945 --> 15:47.948
I think about dogs
and my mom's Christmas chili.

15:48.031 --> 15:51.410
-Why don't you try it?
-Why would I think about your mom's chili?

15:51.493 --> 15:52.911
I've never even had it.

15:52.995 --> 15:56.498
I meant try thinking about something
that makes you really happy.

15:57.583 --> 15:59.001
Well, I do like--

15:59.084 --> 16:00.544
Aside from drones.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.172
I was gonna say playing basketball.

16:03.255 --> 16:07.593
Really? Me too. Maybe we could
shoot some hoops together sometime.

16:07.676 --> 16:11.930
I don't know. The last thing
we did together didn't go so well.

16:16.602 --> 16:18.687
-Where'd she go?
-Who knows?

16:18.770 --> 16:22.316
I can't believe I lost a little brother
and a puppy in the same day.

16:22.399 --> 16:25.319
A search and rescue career
is so not in my future.

16:26.695 --> 16:27.946
Look.

16:29.573 --> 16:30.532
Scout!

16:35.996 --> 16:39.458
I bet if we each shot 100 free throws
every day after school,

16:39.541 --> 16:42.711
we would definitely make
the middle school team in a few years.

16:42.794 --> 16:46.798
Yeah, if we both have
really, really huge growth spurts.

16:48.592 --> 16:51.178
By the way,
it was my fault the drone crashed.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.222
Yeah, I know.

17:02.356 --> 17:03.982
Wait. I hear something.

17:06.693 --> 17:07.694
Help.

17:07.778 --> 17:10.489
-Help!
-We're locked in. Help!

17:10.571 --> 17:12.657
-Help!
-Help!

17:12.741 --> 17:13.742
Charles?

17:14.785 --> 17:16.869
-Charles?
-Scout!

17:16.954 --> 17:18.997
-Are you guys okay?
-Yeah.

17:19.080 --> 17:20.290
How'd you find us?

17:20.374 --> 17:23.627
It was Scout. She sniffed Charles's hat
and searched and rescued.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.212
I knew I was right about her.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.172
Thanks, Scout.

17:27.256 --> 17:31.093
I have to admit, there are some things
a dog can do that drones can't.

17:31.176 --> 17:33.804
Yeah, like lick your face
when they find you.

17:36.390 --> 17:37.391
Hi.

17:37.474 --> 17:40.853
It was all Scout.
She didn't give up until she found them.

17:40.936 --> 17:43.021
That's just as good as any of my stories.

17:43.105 --> 17:46.066
You were right, Lizzie.
Little Scout had it in her all along.

17:46.149 --> 17:49.194
We were right.
You believed in Scout too.

17:49.862 --> 17:51.947
Meg,
if Scout failed all her training tests,

17:52.030 --> 17:54.074
how was she able
to find Charles and Russell?

17:54.157 --> 17:56.952
A great search and rescue dog
will step up in an emergency.

17:57.035 --> 18:00.247
She must've sensed there was real danger
and trusted her instincts.

18:00.330 --> 18:03.292
I'm gonna work with her more
and have her tested and reevaluated.

18:03.375 --> 18:05.169
Wow. So, if she passes--

18:05.252 --> 18:07.254
When she passes.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.465
When she passes, will she live with you?

18:11.550 --> 18:13.177
As long as Casey's good with it.

18:16.889 --> 18:18.098
I'd say that's a yes.

18:18.182 --> 18:19.641
Yeah.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.739
Hey. Pretty crazy day, huh?

18:33.822 --> 18:35.115
Tell me about it.

18:35.699 --> 18:39.411
Russell said he was really scared.
He was lucky to have you there.

18:40.162 --> 18:45.125
It's weird. I was scared too.
But then I thought about what Dad told me.

18:45.709 --> 18:48.003
You know, you and Scout,
you're a lot alike.

18:48.086 --> 18:50.088
You both stepped up
when it really mattered.

18:50.672 --> 18:52.966
Yeah, I guess we did.

18:54.551 --> 18:56.887
-Good night, Charles.
-Night.

19:01.391 --> 19:02.643
Hey, Lizzie?

19:03.936 --> 19:04.937
Yeah?

19:05.521 --> 19:06.980
You can close it all the way.
