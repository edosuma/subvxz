WEBVTT

00:01.587 --> 00:04.383
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.521 --> 00:07.248
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.386 --> 00:11.942
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:12.081 --> 00:14.876
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:15.015 --> 00:17.810
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.948 --> 00:21.952
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.609 --> 00:25.991
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.129 --> 00:28.718
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.856 --> 00:31.272
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.410 --> 00:33.999
Just to get up that hill

00:34.137 --> 00:36.553
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.691 --> 00:39.108
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.246 --> 00:41.627
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.765 --> 00:43.353
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.491 --> 00:46.149
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.287 --> 00:49.152
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.290 --> 00:53.743
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.881 --> 00:56.608
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.746 --> 00:59.611
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.749 --> 01:05.651
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:09.069 --> 01:10.587
Are you gonna take me
to Nob Hill?

01:10.725 --> 01:11.726
Yep.

01:11.864 --> 01:13.073
And Fisherman's Wharf?
Yep.

01:13.211 --> 01:15.282
Oh, and we've just gotta
ride the cable cars!

01:15.420 --> 01:16.800
We're gonna do
all that and more.

01:16.938 --> 01:18.802
Hey, Weezy, I think I got
my speech all memorized.

01:18.940 --> 01:19.976
Listen and see
if I get it right.

01:20.114 --> 01:22.565
Okay.

01:22.703 --> 01:23.980
That's not in here.

01:26.707 --> 01:27.915
What's not in here?

01:29.779 --> 01:30.780
Weezy...

01:30.918 --> 01:32.851
I'm just kidding,
George. Go ahead.

01:32.989 --> 01:34.163
Thank you,
Mr. Reynolds.

01:34.301 --> 01:36.026
Who's Mr. Reynolds?

01:36.165 --> 01:38.063
He's the chairman of the
dry cleaning convention.

01:38.201 --> 01:39.168
He's gonna introduce me.

01:39.306 --> 01:41.549
Well, you didn't have
to write that down.

01:41.687 --> 01:42.895
That's not part
of your speech.

01:43.033 --> 01:44.656
Look, Weezy, when my
mouth starts moving,

01:44.794 --> 01:46.796
everything that comes out
is part of my speech.

01:47.521 --> 01:49.316
Oh!

01:49.454 --> 01:51.870
Then you ought to
write down "A-heh-hem."

01:52.008 --> 01:53.458
Look, Weezy, there are gonna
be a thousand people

01:53.596 --> 01:54.700
listening to my speech
tomorrow morning.

01:54.838 --> 01:56.323
Now, if all you can do
is stand there...

01:56.461 --> 01:58.670
I'm sorry, George.
Go ahead.

01:58.808 --> 02:02.915
Ladies and gentlemen,
you see standing
before you a black man.

02:03.053 --> 02:04.124
No kidding.

02:06.333 --> 02:07.610
Why ain't
you packing?

02:07.748 --> 02:09.232
'Cause I'm through.
Oh.

02:10.371 --> 02:12.787
So you see standing
before you a black man

02:12.925 --> 02:15.687
who did it on his own
without any help from anybody.

02:15.825 --> 02:17.240
I am a self-made man.

02:17.378 --> 02:18.483
That's nice.

02:18.621 --> 02:19.691
Thank you, Florence.

02:19.829 --> 02:20.968
I mean, it's nice
that you take

02:21.106 --> 02:22.452
all the blame
for how you turned out.

02:25.386 --> 02:26.594
Don't you have
anything to do?

02:26.732 --> 02:27.975
I'm on my coffee break.

02:28.113 --> 02:29.528
Then why don't you go
drink some coffee?

02:29.666 --> 02:31.841
I don't have to drink coffee
on my coffee break.

02:31.979 --> 02:33.877
I can do anything I want to.

02:34.015 --> 02:35.396
And if I want to waste my time
listening to you,

02:35.534 --> 02:36.535
I can do that too.

02:36.673 --> 02:37.640
GEORGE: Florence!

02:37.778 --> 02:39.918
But I think coffee
would do me more good.

02:42.645 --> 02:44.371
You know, I think
we made a mistake, Weezy.

02:44.509 --> 02:47.063
We should have sent her
packing months ago.

02:47.201 --> 02:48.685
Say "cheddar"!

02:50.204 --> 02:51.447
Ha! There you are, Mr. J.

02:51.585 --> 02:54.381
In just 60 seconds,
you'll be smiling
up at yourself.

02:54.519 --> 02:56.624
Look, Bentley,
I don't have time to
pause for snapshots.

02:56.762 --> 02:58.350
I'm just bringing over
my camera.

02:58.488 --> 03:00.939
Mrs. Jefferson asked
if she could borrow
it for your trip.

03:01.077 --> 03:02.389
Oh, that's great!
Thanks.

03:02.527 --> 03:04.563
And thank you for walking
on my back this morning.

03:04.701 --> 03:06.082
As usual,
it did the trick.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.084
You have magic
feet, Mr. J.

03:08.222 --> 03:11.121
Yeah,
I played soul music
on your slipped disk.

03:13.158 --> 03:15.436
Hey, Weezy, Bentley
brought his camera over.

03:15.574 --> 03:17.714
Oh, thank you.
Are you sure you don't mind?

03:17.852 --> 03:18.853
Oh, not a bit.

03:18.991 --> 03:20.096
Just be sure
to bring me back

03:20.234 --> 03:22.063
a picture of that
dear old Mark Hopkins.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.825
Look, Bentley,
we won't have time
to visit all your buddies.

03:24.963 --> 03:27.621
The Mark Hopkins
is a hotel, George.

03:27.759 --> 03:28.932
I knew that.

03:30.486 --> 03:33.143
Yes, four of the most
fabulous days of my life.

03:33.282 --> 03:35.284
Frisco and Frederica.

03:35.422 --> 03:36.699
Ah, Frederica.

03:36.837 --> 03:38.873
A girl with a wonderful
one-track mind.

03:39.357 --> 03:41.704
Oh, Mr. Bentley!

03:41.842 --> 03:44.431
Oh, no! I mean she was
crazy about cable cars.

03:44.569 --> 03:46.226
We rang the bell
all weekend.

03:46.364 --> 03:47.986
Hey, this
don't look like me.

03:48.124 --> 03:50.022
This is some
big fat white guy.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.438
Oh, that's my finger.

03:51.576 --> 03:53.681
I keep putting it in front
of the lens. I'm sorry.

03:55.062 --> 03:56.477
Would you like
some coffee?

03:56.615 --> 03:58.583
Oh, no, thank you.
I've got to go.

03:58.721 --> 04:00.964
The Lebanese problem
again, I'm afraid.

04:01.102 --> 04:03.173
Oh, that would
drive me crazy

04:03.312 --> 04:05.555
if I had a job like yours
at the United Nations.

04:05.693 --> 04:08.006
All those countries
arguing and fighting.

04:08.144 --> 04:09.490
Oh, this isn't
at the UN.

04:09.628 --> 04:11.699
It's downstairs
in the garage.

04:11.837 --> 04:13.322
In the where?

04:13.460 --> 04:16.221
I'm having a problem again
with Mr. Babakian,

04:16.359 --> 04:18.361
the Lebanese gentleman
who parks next to me.

04:18.499 --> 04:19.569
What kind
of problem?

04:19.707 --> 04:20.846
Dings.

04:21.882 --> 04:23.021
What's "dings"?

04:23.159 --> 04:25.195
Oh, dings are caused
by dunches.

04:25.334 --> 04:26.645
Oh, I see.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.475
What's "dunches"?

04:29.510 --> 04:32.306
A dunch is... Well...

04:32.444 --> 04:34.343
It's when someone parks
too close to you

04:34.481 --> 04:37.069
and when he gets out,
he hits your car
with his door.

04:37.207 --> 04:38.347
Dunch!

04:40.176 --> 04:42.178
Which makes a dent,
which leaves a ding.

04:42.316 --> 04:45.768
So the dunches' dents
have damaged your door
with dings.

04:46.493 --> 04:47.735
I think she's got it.

04:48.874 --> 04:50.497
You mean this guy
keeps hitting your car?

04:50.635 --> 04:51.981
Yes, I've tried
phoning him about it,

04:52.119 --> 04:53.707
but he just
hangs up on me.

04:53.845 --> 04:56.537
So I wrote him
a rather nice letter,
but he never replied.

04:56.675 --> 04:58.332
Then there's only
one thing left to do.

04:58.470 --> 05:00.369
What's that?
Take him to Knuckle City.

05:02.232 --> 05:04.062
George, that's
terrible advice.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.375
Oh, I don't think I could
do it anyway, Mrs. Jefferson.

05:06.513 --> 05:08.929
See, that's what's
wrong with you, Bentley.
You're too nice.

05:09.067 --> 05:10.482
But don't you think problems

05:10.620 --> 05:12.553
should be settled
by peaceful negotiation?

05:12.691 --> 05:14.452
Of course I do.
That's what I'm saying.

05:14.590 --> 05:16.246
You just walk up
to Babakian and you say,

05:16.385 --> 05:17.869
"Look, stop putting
dings in my car."

05:18.007 --> 05:20.181
And if he says no,
you put a dunch on his head.

05:22.114 --> 05:23.668
I thought a dunch
was something you did

05:23.806 --> 05:25.808
with doughnuts and coffee.

05:25.946 --> 05:28.155
Ain't you got some
last-minute packing to do?

05:28.293 --> 05:29.432
Oh, how nice, Florence.

05:29.570 --> 05:31.296
You're going to
San Francisco too, eh?

05:31.434 --> 05:32.780
Oh, not me, Mr. Bentley.

05:32.918 --> 05:35.749
Only rich bosses get to make
them kind of exciting trips.

05:38.579 --> 05:40.236
People in lowly positions
like me

05:40.374 --> 05:42.065
just have to stay behind
and do the scrubbing...

05:42.203 --> 05:43.377
Florence!

05:43.515 --> 05:44.792
Yes, ma'am.
I'm packing.

05:47.070 --> 05:49.314
And I'm gonna put two bottles
of aspirin in for your flight.

05:49.452 --> 05:51.143
Flying doesn't give me
a headache.

05:51.281 --> 05:52.904
I know, but listening
to him will.

05:55.527 --> 05:57.702
Mr. Bentley,
don't listen to George.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.187
Violence isn't the answer
to anything.

06:00.325 --> 06:02.396
All right, look. So you
don't have to hit Babakian.

06:02.534 --> 06:04.122
Just act like
you might hit him.

06:04.260 --> 06:06.089
By Jove.
I'm going to try that.

06:06.227 --> 06:07.746
I'll march angrily
up to his door.

06:07.884 --> 06:08.920
Good.

06:09.058 --> 06:10.646
I'll knock on it
very angrily.
Good.

06:10.784 --> 06:11.992
And then, when
he opens the door...

06:12.130 --> 06:13.580
You'll start
talking polite again.

06:15.547 --> 06:16.617
How did you guess?

06:16.755 --> 06:18.343
Okay, so here's
what you do.

06:18.481 --> 06:19.758
You just write
a real tough note

06:19.896 --> 06:21.242
and stick it on
his windshield wiper.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.623
Oh, good idea.

06:22.761 --> 06:24.453
Something really
strong, like,

06:24.591 --> 06:26.972
"Dear sir, I wonder
if you'd be kind enough

06:27.110 --> 06:28.595
"to please refrain from..."

06:30.424 --> 06:32.668
If this is the way you guys
talk at the United Nations,

06:32.806 --> 06:33.945
no wonder the world's
in a mess.

06:34.083 --> 06:35.429
Come here.

06:36.810 --> 06:39.640
See, Bentley, first you gotta
get his attention, right?

06:39.778 --> 06:41.021
I'm gonna give you this,

06:41.159 --> 06:42.816
and I want you to put this
on his windshield wiper.

06:42.954 --> 06:45.128
And I guarantee you,
all your troubles
will be over.

06:47.061 --> 06:48.338
Well, thank you.

06:49.892 --> 06:50.996
Here.

06:52.308 --> 06:54.034
"Dear turkey,

06:54.172 --> 06:57.140
"Stop busting my car door
or I'm gonna jump on your hood

06:57.278 --> 06:58.832
"and go upside your head"?

07:01.524 --> 07:04.631
Isn't that a little strong,
coming from Mr. Bentley?

07:04.769 --> 07:06.495
He's gotta
be strong, Weezy.

07:06.633 --> 07:07.634
Well, you're right, but...

07:07.772 --> 07:09.118
No buts, Bentley!

07:09.256 --> 07:10.775
It's about time
you stopped letting
people push you around.

07:21.026 --> 07:22.234
Three days?

07:22.372 --> 07:24.098
I could live out of these bags
for four months.

07:25.962 --> 07:28.033
And six pair
of undershorts?

07:28.896 --> 07:30.139
That's sinful.

07:32.279 --> 07:33.280
Florence...

07:36.386 --> 07:37.526
Hello?

07:38.147 --> 07:39.666
Yes, this is he.

07:40.011 --> 07:41.012
Who?

07:41.150 --> 07:43.117
Oh, hi, Bentley! Hey!

07:43.255 --> 07:44.912
What? Did you do it?

07:45.050 --> 07:46.569
Huh?

07:46.707 --> 07:49.227
Damn right! I wanna hear all
about it. I'll be right down.

07:49.365 --> 07:50.573
Hey, Weezy,
Bentley did it.

07:50.711 --> 07:51.747
He wants me to meet him
down at Charley's Bar.

07:51.885 --> 07:53.887
But, George, we've got
a plane to catch.

07:54.025 --> 07:55.785
Relax, Weezy. The plane
don't leave till 5:00.

07:55.923 --> 07:57.200
We still got three hours.

07:59.962 --> 08:02.689
Oh, Mrs. Jefferson,
I can't wait for
y'all to get back.

08:02.827 --> 08:05.277
I know, Florence.
You'll be lonely.

08:05.415 --> 08:06.589
Oh, it ain't that.

08:06.727 --> 08:08.039
I figure that
if Tony Bennett

08:08.177 --> 08:09.868
can leave his heart
in San Francisco,

08:10.006 --> 08:11.836
maybe Mr. Jefferson
could leave his mouth.

08:17.911 --> 08:19.222
Hey, Bentley.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.983
I see my note
worked for you, huh?

08:21.880 --> 08:23.123
It certainly did.

08:25.021 --> 08:26.126
Damn!

08:27.645 --> 08:29.336
Boy, that is some shiner!

08:29.474 --> 08:31.200
You're gonna have to do
something about that, quick.

08:31.338 --> 08:33.823
Oh, I am. I'm drinking
just as quick as I can.

08:35.238 --> 08:36.550
Two more doubles, please.

08:36.999 --> 08:38.483
What happened?

08:38.621 --> 08:41.521
I gave him your note,
he gave me this eye.

08:41.659 --> 08:43.039
And then
what did you do?

08:43.177 --> 08:44.696
Well, I said, "Ouch."

08:46.146 --> 08:47.803
And then I tried
to reason with him.

08:47.941 --> 08:49.770
Reason? You mean
you didn't hit him back?

08:49.908 --> 08:51.496
Mr. J, I couldn't.

08:51.634 --> 08:53.360
I don't believe
in violence.

08:53.498 --> 08:55.327
That ain't violence.
That's revenge.

08:56.743 --> 08:58.261
So I tried
reasoning with him.

08:59.090 --> 09:00.609
He made two suggestions.

09:00.747 --> 09:03.197
A, he told me
what I could do
with my car.

09:04.336 --> 09:05.545
Which is impossible.

09:09.756 --> 09:11.896
And B, he told me I should
park on the street,

09:12.034 --> 09:13.794
which I did.

09:13.932 --> 09:15.175
Bentley, you know,
you're hopeless.

09:15.313 --> 09:17.177
You'll never be nothing
but a nice guy.

09:17.315 --> 09:19.006
Mr. J, please don't go.

09:19.144 --> 09:20.974
There's something
I ought to explain to you.

09:22.078 --> 09:24.564
Do you notice anything
about these hands?

09:24.702 --> 09:25.979
Yeah, they're white.

09:27.705 --> 09:29.707
They're dangerous weapons.

09:29.845 --> 09:31.743
Once, when I was
a lad in school,

09:31.881 --> 09:34.056
my friend Monty
made me so furious

09:34.194 --> 09:36.092
I couldn't
restrain my anger.

09:36.230 --> 09:38.819
I drew back my fist,
lashed out,

09:38.957 --> 09:41.339
and Monty
lost three teeth.

09:41.477 --> 09:42.720
You hit him in the mouth?

09:43.652 --> 09:45.861
No, I never hit anyone
in my life.

09:45.999 --> 09:47.517
Then how did he lose
three teeth?

09:47.656 --> 09:49.485
I swung, Monty ducked,

09:49.623 --> 09:52.143
and he banged his mouth
on the desk.

09:52.281 --> 09:55.560
At that moment,
I vowed never to raise
my hand in anger again.

09:55.698 --> 09:57.251
Why? You didn't
hit nobody.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.632
But if it
hadn't been for me,

09:58.770 --> 10:00.392
Monty wouldn't have
lost his teeth.

10:00.530 --> 10:02.153
Can't you see
my position?

10:02.291 --> 10:03.568
Yeah, I see, Bentley.

10:03.706 --> 10:04.707
You a coward.

10:06.088 --> 10:08.055
Mr. J, that's
an ugly thing to say.

10:08.193 --> 10:09.367
Well, it's the truth.

10:09.505 --> 10:10.989
I didn't say
it wasn't the truth,

10:11.127 --> 10:12.232
just that it was ugly.

10:16.892 --> 10:19.757
Mr. J, you've opened
my eyes for me.

10:19.895 --> 10:23.036
All these years,
I've been nothing
but an abject coward.

10:23.174 --> 10:24.313
Right on, Bentley.

10:24.451 --> 10:26.177
I mean, there's a time
for negotiation, yes,

10:26.315 --> 10:28.006
but there is also
a time for action.

10:28.144 --> 10:29.421
And now's the time
for action, right?

10:29.559 --> 10:30.940
Right!

10:31.078 --> 10:33.080
Mr. J, you're looking at
a new Harry Bentley.

10:33.218 --> 10:34.288
Attaboy, Bentley.

10:34.426 --> 10:35.842
From now on, nobody
pushes you around, right?

10:35.980 --> 10:37.153
You're damn right
they won't!

10:37.291 --> 10:39.121
I mean, a man's car
is his castle.

10:39.259 --> 10:42.193
Anyone touches
me or my castle
had better beware.

10:42.331 --> 10:43.677
Hey, you,
don't you know better

10:43.815 --> 10:44.989
than to park
in front of a hydrant?

10:48.993 --> 10:50.270
There. Is that
what you meant?

10:50.408 --> 10:52.341
Not a cop, Bentley!
Not a cop!

11:01.005 --> 11:04.008
Nobody knows

11:05.009 --> 11:07.770
The trouble I've seen

11:08.737 --> 11:14.087
Nobody knows my sorrow

11:19.230 --> 11:20.680
Okay, inside, Bressler.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.410
Ah, Mr. Bressler, was it?

11:27.548 --> 11:28.722
I'd like to
introduce myself.

11:28.860 --> 11:30.620
My name is Bentley,
Harry Bentley.

11:31.207 --> 11:32.588
I got enough friends.

11:34.314 --> 11:35.349
What a fortunate man.

11:36.834 --> 11:38.939
Get your butt
off of my bunk!

11:39.837 --> 11:40.907
I beg your pardon?

11:41.045 --> 11:43.668
I said get your butt
off of my bunk!

11:45.601 --> 11:47.396
Let's get
one thing straight.

11:47.534 --> 11:50.744
That is my bunk,
and that is your bunk.

11:51.331 --> 11:52.435
Why?

11:52.573 --> 11:54.334
Shut up, that's why.

11:55.922 --> 11:57.268
Oh, I see your point.

11:58.614 --> 12:00.892
I... I didn't realize
the bunks were assigned.

12:02.204 --> 12:03.619
I'm terribly sorry.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.415
Won't happen again,
I assure you.

12:07.278 --> 12:09.383
Get your foot
off of my bunk.

12:12.386 --> 12:13.560
Sorry.

12:15.251 --> 12:17.391
How do you suggest
I get on my bunk?

12:18.116 --> 12:19.359
Try flying.

12:19.497 --> 12:21.292
You're a jailbird, ain't you?

12:31.129 --> 12:32.752
What they got you in here for?

12:32.890 --> 12:34.615
Picking daisies in the park?

12:35.824 --> 12:37.377
No, I hit a policeman.

12:37.515 --> 12:38.550
You what?

12:38.688 --> 12:40.173
Yes, I knocked him flat.

12:40.311 --> 12:42.865
Hey, pal, come over here
and sit down.

12:43.003 --> 12:44.246
Tell me all about it.

12:45.350 --> 12:46.317
On your bunk?

12:46.455 --> 12:47.939
On our bunk.

12:50.321 --> 12:52.219
Hey, what happened?
Did he hassle you?

12:52.357 --> 12:54.635
No, he just walked up to me
and asked me a question,

12:54.774 --> 12:55.705
and I hit him.

12:55.844 --> 12:58.570
Wow. Beautiful.

12:59.088 --> 13:00.296
Beautiful?

13:00.434 --> 13:02.505
They're going
to incarcerate me
for what I've done.

13:02.643 --> 13:04.818
Nah, they don't
burn people no more.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.132
They just send you up
to the big house

13:08.270 --> 13:09.202
for a couple of years.

13:09.340 --> 13:10.686
Oh, Lord.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.308
Listen, you got nothing
to worry about.

13:12.446 --> 13:13.551
It'll be a breeze.

13:13.689 --> 13:16.243
When those guys up there
find out you hit a cop,

13:16.381 --> 13:18.176
they'll roll out
the red carpet for you.

13:18.314 --> 13:19.833
You'll be a celebrity.

13:19.971 --> 13:22.042
Hey, Bentley! I got here
as fast as I could.

13:22.180 --> 13:23.526
I made your bail.
You're free.

13:23.664 --> 13:24.942
Oh, thank you,
Mr. J.

13:25.080 --> 13:26.667
Oh, I beg
your pardon.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.428
I'd like you to meet
my friend, Mr. Bressler.

13:28.566 --> 13:30.016
Um, Mr. Bressler,
this is my dear friend...

13:30.154 --> 13:31.880
I ain't got no time to
meet no cons, Bentley.

13:32.018 --> 13:33.433
I got a plane
to catch at 5:00.

13:33.571 --> 13:34.606
Come on!

13:34.744 --> 13:35.953
Oh, in a moment.

13:36.677 --> 13:37.817
Goodbye,
Mr. Bressler.

13:37.955 --> 13:39.542
Yeah,
so long, pal.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.613
Keep punching, if you
know what I mean, huh?

13:43.167 --> 13:45.100
Oh!
Let's go!

13:45.238 --> 13:46.549
I'm afraid
I can't.

13:46.895 --> 13:47.965
Why not?

13:48.103 --> 13:49.345
I going to need
your feet again.

13:49.483 --> 13:50.519
Be a good fellow,
will you?

13:50.657 --> 13:52.348
Bentley, I got a cab
waiting outside.

13:52.486 --> 13:54.212
I'm afraid I won't
make it to the cab.

14:02.048 --> 14:05.223
Oh, that's it! Yes!
Oh, marvelous! That's heaven.

14:06.155 --> 14:08.502
I don't get it.
First this guy slugs a cop.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.746
Then he lets this little runt
walk all over him.

14:11.712 --> 14:12.921
Mmm! Oh!

14:14.612 --> 14:16.372
Come on, Weezy. I got
a cab waiting downstairs.

14:16.510 --> 14:18.202
We still could make
the 5:00 flight.

14:18.340 --> 14:20.652
You mean everything went fine
down at the police station?

14:20.790 --> 14:22.585
Perfect. Everything
is just perfect.

14:22.723 --> 14:24.449
California
here we come

14:24.587 --> 14:25.623
Mwah!

14:25.761 --> 14:27.073
Oh, that's marvelous,
George.

14:27.211 --> 14:29.040
You actually
got Mr. Bentley off.

14:29.178 --> 14:31.146
Sure, just paid his bail
and got him out of jail.

14:32.526 --> 14:33.631
Is that all?

14:33.769 --> 14:34.701
What do you mean,
"Is that all"?

14:34.839 --> 14:36.427
It cost me $500.

14:38.222 --> 14:40.362
Weezy, what are you doing?
We got a plane to catch.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.640
Not until you
get Mr. Bentley off.

14:42.778 --> 14:43.779
What?

14:43.917 --> 14:45.746
We are not going
to any convention

14:45.885 --> 14:47.921
until you clear up
this business.

14:48.059 --> 14:50.751
Don't you realize
Mr. Bentley isn't a citizen?

14:50.890 --> 14:53.720
If he's convicted,
he could lose his job
and be deported.

14:53.858 --> 14:55.204
Yeah, and If I don't get
to San Francisco,

14:55.342 --> 14:56.826
then I won't be able to make
my speech at the convention.

14:57.551 --> 14:58.656
What's more important?

14:58.794 --> 15:01.279
Your speech or Mr. Bentley's
whole future?

15:01.417 --> 15:03.626
Oh, Weezy.
My speech, of course.

15:06.250 --> 15:07.976
Okay, if you want me
to help Bentley,

15:08.114 --> 15:09.632
I'll talk that cop Rossi
into dropping the charges.

15:09.770 --> 15:10.910
Good.

15:11.048 --> 15:12.256
As soon as we get back
from San Francisco.

15:13.671 --> 15:15.500
Weezy,
are you crazy?

15:15.638 --> 15:18.193
I can't get Bentley
out of all the mess
he's in just like that.

15:18.331 --> 15:19.711
Why not?

15:19.849 --> 15:22.818
You were the one who got him
in that mess just like that.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.372
Okay, I'll get Rossi over here
and make him drop the charges.

15:25.510 --> 15:27.202
How you going to
get a hold of Rossi?

15:27.340 --> 15:28.306
Easy.

15:28.444 --> 15:30.032
I'll just call
our doorman,

15:30.170 --> 15:31.654
Ralph, the human
bloodhound.

15:34.174 --> 15:36.383
Hello, Ralph.
George Jefferson.

15:36.521 --> 15:39.179
Look, Ralph. How'd you like
to make a quick 20 bucks?

15:39.317 --> 15:41.285
Ha-ha. Ralph,
stop slobbering.

15:43.528 --> 15:45.220
Well, you know
that patrolman named Rossi?

15:45.358 --> 15:46.669
Yeah, the one
Bentley hit.

15:46.807 --> 15:48.016
Well, I want you
to find him

15:48.154 --> 15:50.018
and tell him I want
to see him right away.

15:50.156 --> 15:51.605
What do you mean,
"What if he won't come?"

15:51.743 --> 15:53.297
Tell him I'll make it
worth his while.

15:53.435 --> 15:55.195
And you know what that
means, don't you, Ralph?

15:56.645 --> 15:58.198
Good.

15:58.336 --> 15:59.924
What does that mean, George?

16:00.062 --> 16:01.305
It means now I call
the airlines

16:01.443 --> 16:02.789
and have our tickets
changed

16:02.927 --> 16:04.480
to the 7:15 flight
to San Francisco.

16:10.831 --> 16:12.281
Where is
that Rossi?

16:13.317 --> 16:14.732
I'm giving Ralph
a $20 tip,

16:14.870 --> 16:16.354
and I'm getting
20-cent service.

16:16.492 --> 16:17.873
I'll kill him.

16:18.011 --> 16:19.633
No, I just
won't tip him. Ha!

16:19.771 --> 16:21.049
That'll kill him.

16:22.257 --> 16:24.397
We'll never make
that 7:15 flight now.

16:24.535 --> 16:26.882
Then I guess we'll have to
forget about San Francisco.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.678
No way. There's still
a redeye night flight.

16:29.816 --> 16:30.990
It makes a quick stop
at St. Louis

16:31.128 --> 16:32.922
and gets there about
3 or 4:00 in the morning.

16:33.371 --> 16:34.821
If we make it.

16:34.959 --> 16:36.098
We'll make it.

16:36.236 --> 16:38.859
Rossi can be reasoned with.
He's a nice guy.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.930
Isn't he the one
who gave you a ticket

16:41.069 --> 16:43.761
for parking your van
six inches too close
to a hydrant?

16:43.899 --> 16:46.143
Yeah!
That dumb turkey!

16:47.627 --> 16:49.249
Then what makes you think
you can talk him

16:49.387 --> 16:51.355
out of pressing charges
against Mr. Bentley?

16:51.493 --> 16:53.978
I'll just have to use
my personality and charm.

16:56.049 --> 16:58.776
Suppose he still insists
on going by the book?

17:00.260 --> 17:01.848
Well, I'll just have to
stick to the book too.

17:01.986 --> 17:03.022
My bankbook.

17:04.920 --> 17:06.749
Well, well, well!
Look who's here.

17:06.887 --> 17:07.888
Officer Rossi!

17:08.027 --> 17:09.097
Come in, come in.

17:09.235 --> 17:10.201
Thanks.

17:10.339 --> 17:11.271
Miss. Jefferson.

17:11.409 --> 17:12.790
Ah, ain't this
a surprise!

17:13.687 --> 17:14.757
How can it be a surprise?

17:14.895 --> 17:16.311
Ralph said you wanted
to see me.

17:16.449 --> 17:17.657
Oh, yeah.

17:17.795 --> 17:19.521
Weezy, don't just sit there.
Get the man a drink.

17:19.659 --> 17:21.074
You want
a martini, Rossi?

17:26.976 --> 17:28.254
No, thanks,
Mrs. Jefferson.

17:28.392 --> 17:29.634
I never drink
on duty.

17:29.772 --> 17:31.671
Oh, well, look,
let's not waste
your valuable time.

17:31.809 --> 17:33.293
Tell you why
I wanted to see you.

17:33.431 --> 17:34.708
As you know,

17:34.846 --> 17:36.400
you and me never really
hit it off too good, right?

17:36.538 --> 17:37.711
Right.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.092
And it's probably
my fault.

17:39.230 --> 17:40.369
Right!

17:41.474 --> 17:42.647
And I know
you wouldn't be

17:42.785 --> 17:44.684
giving out all those tickets
without a reason.

17:44.822 --> 17:46.272
That's what I've
been telling you.

17:46.410 --> 17:47.963
And I just think
it's up to us citizens

17:48.101 --> 17:49.689
to improve our relationships
with the fuzz.

17:49.827 --> 17:51.587
Uh-uh-uh...
Police officers.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.971
So I have decided to make
a donation, on account.

17:56.523 --> 17:58.007
On account of what?

17:58.146 --> 17:59.699
On account I never
donated before.

18:00.734 --> 18:02.426
What kind
of a donation?

18:02.564 --> 18:04.600
A big one.
To the policeman's ball.

18:05.601 --> 18:06.878
I can't accept it.

18:07.016 --> 18:08.328
Why not?

18:08.466 --> 18:10.261
Because we haven't had
a policeman's ball for years.

18:10.399 --> 18:12.677
Oh! That's probably why
I never bought a ticket.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.404
But if you're
looking for a place

18:15.542 --> 18:16.957
where your money
can do some good,

18:17.786 --> 18:19.477
there's the police
athletic league.

18:19.615 --> 18:20.823
That's a good cause.

18:20.961 --> 18:23.102
Yeah! Get some of those
fat cops back in shape.

18:25.242 --> 18:27.520
That money goes
to children, George.

18:27.658 --> 18:31.869
Weezy, we'll let Officer Rossi
decide where the money goes.

18:32.525 --> 18:34.078
How's 100 bucks sound?

18:34.216 --> 18:35.666
Like a drop
in the bucket.

18:35.804 --> 18:37.633
Takes a lot of money
to furnish a new gym,

18:37.771 --> 18:38.876
if you know
what I mean.

18:39.014 --> 18:40.119
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

18:40.257 --> 18:41.775
Uh, I'll just add
four more drops.

18:43.087 --> 18:45.779
Hey, that's, uh...
That's very nice of you.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.056
I hope you'll
remember that.

18:48.679 --> 18:50.094
I'll get it.

18:53.822 --> 18:54.892
Oh, Mrs. Jefferson.

18:55.030 --> 18:56.342
Ralph told me
Officer Rossi was here.

18:56.480 --> 18:57.653
And I've
come to apologize.

18:57.791 --> 18:58.999
Oh, officer, please,
you must...

18:59.138 --> 19:00.587
Get away from me.

19:00.725 --> 19:02.071
But I want you to know
how sorry...
Forget it, Bentley.

19:02.210 --> 19:04.488
I got you into this mess,
and I just got you out of it.

19:04.626 --> 19:05.730
Here's your check,
officer.

19:05.868 --> 19:08.077
Thanks, Mr. Jefferson.

19:08.216 --> 19:12.634
Uh, what did you mean
when you said you just
got him out of it?

19:12.772 --> 19:14.567
Well, uh, Bentley made
a little mistake.

19:14.705 --> 19:15.913
I made a big donation.

19:16.051 --> 19:18.087
And, uh, everything
is square, right?

19:18.226 --> 19:20.435
You trying to bribe
an officer of the law?

19:20.573 --> 19:22.333
No! No, nothing like that.

19:22.471 --> 19:24.439
Oh, no.
Nothing like that.

19:26.372 --> 19:29.237
Officer, I feel terrible about
what I did this afternoon.

19:29.375 --> 19:30.790
So does my jaw.

19:30.928 --> 19:32.999
I want to apologize
from the bottom of my heart.

19:33.137 --> 19:35.104
It is not in my nature
to behave that way,

19:35.243 --> 19:36.554
and it will never
happen again.

19:36.692 --> 19:37.831
You betcha.

19:40.386 --> 19:41.594
Nice try, folks.

19:42.284 --> 19:43.561
What are you
talking about?

19:43.699 --> 19:44.631
The setup.

19:44.769 --> 19:45.943
You get me up here,

19:46.081 --> 19:48.532
make a contribution
to my favorite charity,

19:48.670 --> 19:50.879
apologize all over the place.

19:51.017 --> 19:53.916
Now I'm supposed to do my part
and drop the charges, right?

19:54.054 --> 19:55.124
Right!

19:55.263 --> 19:57.575
But, officer,
my apology was sincere.

19:58.127 --> 19:59.612
Sure it was.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.338
Officer, please.

20:01.476 --> 20:04.306
Uh, let me tell you
something about Mr. Bentley.

20:04.444 --> 20:07.413
Harry Bentley is
the nicest, kindest,

20:07.551 --> 20:09.656
most gentle man
I have ever met.

20:09.794 --> 20:12.107
Especially when
he's punching out cops.

20:12.245 --> 20:13.557
Oh, he would have
never done that

20:13.695 --> 20:15.248
if he hadn't been
talked into it

20:15.386 --> 20:17.319
by some meddling loudmouth.

20:17.457 --> 20:18.493
Right, George?

20:18.631 --> 20:20.253
Yeah.
Whoever that was.

20:22.393 --> 20:23.532
Look, Mrs. Jefferson,

20:23.670 --> 20:25.914
I already signed
the desk appearance ticket.

20:26.052 --> 20:27.812
So I couldn't drop this now
even if I wanted to,

20:27.950 --> 20:28.951
which I don't.

20:29.089 --> 20:30.125
But, officer!

20:30.263 --> 20:31.920
You just wasting
your breath, Weezy.

20:32.058 --> 20:33.646
The last favor
Rossi did for anybody

20:33.784 --> 20:35.337
was when he left
his wife and kids.

20:36.442 --> 20:37.684
What you say?

20:37.822 --> 20:39.134
You heard me!

20:39.272 --> 20:41.274
The only thing you're good for
is chasing parked cars.

20:41.412 --> 20:44.070
Oh, Mr. Jefferson,
please don't get into
trouble on my account.

20:44.208 --> 20:45.589
Instead of bothering
decent citizens,

20:45.727 --> 20:47.418
you ought to be
out there trying to catch
some of them crooks.

20:47.556 --> 20:49.455
Stop it, George.
You've said enough.

20:49.593 --> 20:50.870
No, I haven't.
I'm just starting.

20:51.008 --> 20:51.940
And whenever
you hear...

20:53.355 --> 20:54.529
Hold it.

20:54.667 --> 20:55.909
Hold it!

20:57.394 --> 20:59.016
George!
Are you all right?

20:59.154 --> 21:01.018
Yeah, I'm all right.
Take more than a cop
to hurt me.

21:01.501 --> 21:03.054
A cop. Hmm.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.850
Ow! Weezy!

21:05.988 --> 21:08.715
Oh, it hurts!
Argh!

21:10.959 --> 21:12.167
I'm... I'm...

21:12.305 --> 21:14.100
I'm sorry, Mrs. Jefferson!
It was an accident.

21:14.238 --> 21:15.274
No, it wasn't!

21:15.412 --> 21:17.586
You hit me!
Deliberately!

21:17.724 --> 21:20.071
In front of two witnesses.
Unfriendly witnesses.

21:20.934 --> 21:22.246
Oh, that's not true,
Mr. Jefferson.

21:22.384 --> 21:23.661
It was purely
an accident.

21:23.799 --> 21:25.214
Don't you
get it, Bentley?

21:25.353 --> 21:27.320
His hitting me is worse
than you hitting him.

21:27.458 --> 21:28.459
Police brutality!

21:28.597 --> 21:30.150
We've got him.
You're off the hook.

21:34.534 --> 21:37.088
Mr. J, not that way.
It wouldn't be honest.

21:38.504 --> 21:40.264
Look, your honesty is
going to get you in jail.

21:40.402 --> 21:41.472
I'm trying to
save your neck.

21:41.610 --> 21:43.543
I know you are,
and I appreciate it.

21:43.681 --> 21:45.234
But I can't lie.

21:45.373 --> 21:47.582
Officer Rossi didn't
mean to strike you.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.169
Is he for real?

21:49.308 --> 21:51.551
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

21:52.621 --> 21:55.210
Bentley, you can forget
about hitting me.

21:55.348 --> 21:58.282
Oh, if only I could.
It's been on my mind.

21:58.420 --> 22:00.940
What I mean is, I'm going to
drop the charges against you.

22:01.078 --> 22:02.355
Wonderful!

22:02.493 --> 22:03.494
Hey, that's great.

22:03.632 --> 22:05.220
Why, thank you.

22:05.358 --> 22:07.809
But there's still
the matter of that
desk appearance ticket.

22:07.947 --> 22:09.466
There he goes again.

22:09.604 --> 22:12.089
All I got to do is
take it out of the file
and rip it up.

22:12.227 --> 22:13.884
But isn't that
against the law?

22:14.022 --> 22:15.126
Sure.

22:18.026 --> 22:19.338
Take care,
Bentley.

22:19.476 --> 22:21.443
Stay just the way
you are.

22:21.581 --> 22:23.652
George, do you know
what this means?

22:23.790 --> 22:26.586
We have time to catch
that redeye to California.

22:26.724 --> 22:27.794
Right!

22:28.450 --> 22:29.520
Hey,
wait a minute.

22:29.658 --> 22:31.384
Uh-oh.

22:31.522 --> 22:33.524
How'd you get that mouse
under your eye?

22:33.662 --> 22:35.975
Oh, uh, courtesy
of Mr. Babakian,

22:36.113 --> 22:38.529
a not-very-considerate
neighbor of mine
in the garage.

22:38.667 --> 22:40.807
Babakian.
I know him.

22:40.945 --> 22:42.430
He's always pushing
people around.

22:42.568 --> 22:43.845
Come on,
Mr. Bentley.

22:43.983 --> 22:45.950
You and I are going to have
a little talk with him.

22:50.127 --> 22:51.680
I gotta protect
this guy.

22:52.543 --> 22:54.165
He's an endangered
species.

23:03.071 --> 23:04.624
Oh, I'm so happy.

23:04.762 --> 23:06.488
Everything turned out
all right.

23:06.626 --> 23:09.249
Yeah. Thanks to
my personality and charm.

23:10.147 --> 23:12.183
Oh, George. Shut up.

23:18.845 --> 23:21.020
And did they like
Mr. Jefferson's speech,
Mrs. Jefferson?

23:21.158 --> 23:22.262
What they heard
of it.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.643
The PA system
went out

23:23.781 --> 23:26.025
right after George said,
"Thank you, Mr. Reynolds."

23:26.163 --> 23:28.130
He had to shout
the rest of his speech.

23:28.268 --> 23:29.925
So how did it
go over?

23:30.063 --> 23:31.306
Oh, it was fine.

23:32.549 --> 23:34.067
He lost his voice.

23:34.205 --> 23:36.104
Thank you, Lord.
You do answer prayer.

23:40.936 --> 23:42.421
What you say?
I can't hear you.

23:44.457 --> 23:45.769
Go do some work.

23:47.149 --> 23:48.703
He's cute,
Mrs. Jefferson.

24:10.518 --> 24:14.211
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
