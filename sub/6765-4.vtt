WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:04.086
Thank you all for coming.

00:04.170 --> 00:09.092
Josh Richland was a profound
figure on this campus.

00:09.175 --> 00:13.304
Most of us knew him as the
managing editor of <i> The Condor,</i>

00:13.388 --> 00:17.225
and more recently,
as a candidate for president

00:17.308 --> 00:19.352
of the student body.

00:19.436 --> 00:23.106
Tomorrow would have been
Josh's first day in office,

00:23.189 --> 00:24.566
and under his jurisdiction,

00:24.649 --> 00:27.235
the student senate
would have convened

00:27.318 --> 00:31.239
and under his leadership, this
university would have set forth

00:31.322 --> 00:33.950
on a path of growth
and unification.

00:34.033 --> 00:37.078
Unfortunately, for all of us,

00:37.162 --> 00:40.290
senseless tragedy
has made that impossible.

00:40.373 --> 00:45.128
Josh's loss will be felt
not only by this institution,

00:45.211 --> 00:47.756
but by the future he will never
have a chance to influence.

00:47.839 --> 00:52.010
But what Josh has left us

00:52.093 --> 00:54.512
is as important as what
he would have given us.

00:54.596 --> 00:57.682
His hopes and dreams,
his talent and wisdom

00:57.766 --> 01:00.268
are now a legacy,

01:00.351 --> 01:05.105
{\an3}a legacy for this campus
to live up to...

01:05.190 --> 01:07.484
the legacy of a brilliant,
young man

01:07.567 --> 01:11.321
who was taken from us too soon.

01:11.404 --> 01:15.492
And it is incumbent
upon all of us

01:15.575 --> 01:19.120
not to let
Josh Richland's dreams

01:19.204 --> 01:20.455
die with him.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.096
♪ ♪

02:27.438 --> 02:29.357
{\an1}That was a tough
thing for you to do,

02:29.440 --> 02:32.318
{\an1}and you did it with
dignity and compassion.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.570
Thank you, sir.

02:33.653 --> 02:34.946
{\an1}You need anything,
you have any problems,

02:35.029 --> 02:36.739
don't hesitate to call.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.408
I sure will.
Thanks again.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.001
Hey, Brandon, the
speech went well.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.587
{\an1}What are you doing over there,
consorting with the enemy?

02:50.670 --> 02:52.964
{\an3}Look, Alex is an influential
member of the senate.

02:53.047 --> 02:54.757
{\an3}You're gonna have to
learn to work with him.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.718
Don't remind me.

02:56.801 --> 02:57.427
Just give it a chance, Brandon.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.763
Fine.

03:04.684 --> 03:05.935
(sighs)

03:06.019 --> 03:06.936
{\an1}Hi.
Hi.

03:07.020 --> 03:07.937
{\an3}Hey, man,

03:08.021 --> 03:09.272
{\an3}I'm sorry.
I know it was

03:09.355 --> 03:10.773
hard on you, but
I gotta tell you,

03:10.857 --> 03:12.317
{\an3}you were great in there.
There wasn't a dry eye

03:12.400 --> 03:13.318
in the house.

03:13.401 --> 03:14.319
Thanks.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.279
{\an3}Uh, Kel, I
think we need

03:16.362 --> 03:17.947
{\an3}to do some work
on this guy,

03:18.031 --> 03:19.782
{\an3}I think you need to
convince him to join you

03:19.866 --> 03:21.910
{\an3}at the frat party
tomorrow night.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.411
It'll do him some good.

03:23.494 --> 03:24.746
{\an3}Steve...
Actually, uh...

03:24.829 --> 03:25.788
{\an3}it'll do <i> me</i> some
good, okay?

03:25.872 --> 03:26.706
{\an3}It doesn't hurt
having the president

03:26.789 --> 03:29.292
of the student body
show up at my party.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.628
All right.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.962
{\an3}Thanks.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.213
See ya.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.510
Excuse me. Brandon?

03:39.594 --> 03:41.971
I'm Gloria Richland,
Josh's older sister.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.514
Hi.
Hi.

03:43.598 --> 03:44.849
Nice to meet you.
Thank you

03:44.933 --> 03:47.185
{\an1}for what you said about
Josh. It meant a lot.

03:47.268 --> 03:49.312
{\an1}Well, I-I really didn't
know Josh that well.

03:49.395 --> 03:53.775
Brandon, I'm gonna be packing
up some of Josh's things.

03:53.858 --> 03:55.318
I thought you might want
to have something of his

03:55.401 --> 03:57.779
{\an1}to remember him by,
so if you want,

03:57.862 --> 03:58.988
I'll be there
all afternoon.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.323
Thanks.

04:01.699 --> 04:02.533
Nice to meet you.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.370
You, too.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.834
Look at that.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.879
She walks just like Josh.

04:53.584 --> 04:56.212
{\an3}What you do with
your dirty clothes

04:56.295 --> 04:56.838
{\an3}all the time
I was in Houston?

04:56.921 --> 04:58.881
I know how to do laundry.

04:58.965 --> 04:59.716
Oh.

04:59.799 --> 05:02.552
But thank God,
you don't have to.

05:02.635 --> 05:03.720
Hmm.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.430
Now, these have to
go to the cleaners,

05:05.513 --> 05:06.514
and can you make sure Evelia

05:06.597 --> 05:08.516
does not put these
in the dryer, please?

05:08.599 --> 05:09.517
Donna, you'd better

05:09.600 --> 05:10.560
marry a very rich man

05:10.643 --> 05:13.354
so that he can support you
in the manner

05:13.438 --> 05:15.023
to which you've
become accustomed.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.691
Are we back on this
track again?

05:16.774 --> 05:19.527
Well, as a matter
of fact, there <i> is</i>

05:19.610 --> 05:23.448
someone new I want you to meet.

05:23.531 --> 05:25.283
Mom, I'm back at school now.

05:25.366 --> 05:26.451
I don't have time for dates.

05:26.534 --> 05:30.580
Now, wait a minute,
he's a junior at C.U.

05:30.663 --> 05:31.622
He's handsome,

05:31.706 --> 05:34.584
he's very bright,

05:34.667 --> 05:36.544
{\an1}he comes from a
very good family,

05:36.627 --> 05:40.423
and he's very special,
he's very good-looking.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.134
And he and his mother are
coming to tea on Monday.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.053
{\an3}He's coming
with his mother?

05:45.136 --> 05:46.262
Are you kidding me?

05:46.346 --> 05:47.805
Donna, don't be a pill.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.515
Besides, I already promised
that you'd be here.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.477
{\an3}So what is this
perfect guy's name?

05:52.560 --> 05:54.437
Uh... Garfield.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.480
Er... Gerald.
Something like that.

05:55.563 --> 05:57.565
{\an3}You don't even
remember his name

05:57.648 --> 05:58.483
{\an3}but you're sure
I'm gonna love him.

05:58.566 --> 05:59.484
Don't be difficult.

05:59.567 --> 06:02.904
Me? Difficult? Never.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.531
(giggles)

06:18.211 --> 06:20.338
Wow. That's some program.

06:20.421 --> 06:21.380
Did you write it?

06:21.464 --> 06:23.549
{\an1}No. I had to shell
out 30 bucks

06:23.633 --> 06:25.176
like everybody else.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.096
I'm David Silver.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.765
{\an3}You're in my, uh, Intro to
Media class, aren't you?

06:30.848 --> 06:34.018
I'm Clare Arnold and I
thought it was <i> my</i>

06:34.102 --> 06:34.977
Intro to Media class.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.981
Sorry.<i> Your</i> Intro
to Media class.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.691
So, are you majoring
in Communications?

06:40.775 --> 06:43.694
No. Double major--
French Lit. and Physics.

06:43.778 --> 06:44.654
Minor in Communications.

06:49.575 --> 06:50.993
Listen.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.495
{\an3}Since you have a
minor interest

06:52.578 --> 06:55.498
in communications, how about
making a minor contribution

06:55.581 --> 06:58.501
{\an3}to the campus TV show
I'm producing?

06:58.584 --> 07:00.503
Oh, yeah?
You're producing it?

07:00.586 --> 07:02.046
Well, some of it.

07:02.130 --> 07:05.758
And... you're sure
it's nothing major?

07:05.842 --> 07:08.636
Well, it could be
something major...

07:08.719 --> 07:11.305
in a minor kind of way.

07:12.723 --> 07:15.351
(chuckles)

07:16.644 --> 07:18.646
Game.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.189
{\an3}Playing for
beers, right?

07:20.273 --> 07:24.235
Naw, too early
for me. Coffee.

07:24.318 --> 07:25.236
Tom!

07:25.319 --> 07:26.863
Beer and a cup of coffee.

07:26.946 --> 07:27.697
So, who was that babe you were
hanging with the other night?

07:27.780 --> 07:28.739
What was her name?

07:28.823 --> 07:31.409
{\an1}Valerie.
Yeah.

07:31.492 --> 07:32.034
She was cute.

07:32.118 --> 07:32.702
So, what happened to her?

07:32.785 --> 07:34.704
Don't know.

07:34.787 --> 07:35.705
Don't much care.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.707
Come on, a girl like that...

07:37.790 --> 07:38.833
I'd care.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.170
At least for a week or two.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.630
You lose, I'll introduce you.

08:01.772 --> 08:04.483
{\an3}This must be really
hard for you.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.070
{\an1}My mother was gonna come
out from New York to help,

08:08.154 --> 08:09.780
{\an1}but it's been a
horrible week for her.

08:09.864 --> 08:13.743
Yeah, I can imagine.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.745
How long have you known Josh?

08:15.828 --> 08:18.831
Uh, I met Josh last year.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.959
He never mentioned you;
that's why I ask.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.755
Of course, Josh was
never the chatty type.

08:25.838 --> 08:28.257
He moved out to California;

08:28.341 --> 08:31.802
We'd be lucky to get a phone
call from him once a month.

08:31.886 --> 08:35.722
Well, Josh was real busy
with the newspaper and politics.

08:37.350 --> 08:41.270
I just keep asking myself why?

08:41.354 --> 08:43.231
Why Josh?

08:45.816 --> 08:48.653
I don't think there's ever
an answer for that question.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.198
I know.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.953
I left out some of his sweaters.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.330
I thought you might want to
look through. Take your pick.

08:59.413 --> 09:00.748
Sweater...?

09:00.831 --> 09:02.500
Or anything else
that you'd like.

09:02.583 --> 09:03.584
No, no, no. No, no.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.586
That's, that's fine.

09:08.172 --> 09:10.633
Joshua always liked blue.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.927
You called him Joshua?

09:15.846 --> 09:19.809
When he was a little boy.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.481
Here.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.112
Thanks.

09:34.740 --> 09:35.825
{\an5}DONNA:
<i>Where'd you get</i>
<i>the camera from?</i>

09:35.908 --> 09:39.328
Oh, I met this really cute
guy in my computer class,

09:39.412 --> 09:40.997
and he convinced me

09:41.080 --> 09:43.499
{\an1}to go down to the TV station
and check it out.

09:43.582 --> 09:45.501
{\an1}They gave me this camera
to fool around with.

09:45.584 --> 09:47.670
Cool. Is it on?

09:47.753 --> 09:50.506
{\an1}I don't know.
I think so.

09:50.589 --> 09:51.591
Mm-hmm.

09:52.591 --> 09:53.342
Hi! Donna here.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.680
{\an1}Huh.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.348
So, Clare, tell us

09:59.432 --> 10:00.516
about this new guy.

10:00.599 --> 10:01.684
Uh...
I don't think so.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.894
Here, give it to me.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.189
{\an1}No, I don't
think so either.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.190
{\an1}You know,

10:08.274 --> 10:08.858
{\an3}my old boyfriend
was a video freak.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.985
{\an3}He used to
have a camera

10:11.068 --> 10:12.987
{\an6}practically attached
to his hip in
high school.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.363
(phone ringing)

10:14.447 --> 10:15.448
Hmm.

10:19.577 --> 10:20.494
Hello?

10:20.578 --> 10:21.954
{\an3}Hi, Mom.

10:22.038 --> 10:22.872
Yes, I told you
I would be there.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.208
Wait.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.419
Would you turn
that thing off?

10:28.502 --> 10:29.920
Hello.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.964
No, Mom, Mom, don't give
him my phone number.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.217
{\an3}No, I'll just see him
at the house on Monday.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.886
I promise,
I'll be there.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.220
By... bye, Mom.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.680
Blind date?

10:39.764 --> 10:41.223
I'd rather eat grass.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.392
{\an3}No kidding. But I can't
say no to my mother.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.935
{\an1}Oh, you're such a
glutton for punishment!

10:45.019 --> 10:47.605
{\an1}Mm.
So,

10:47.688 --> 10:48.773
what do you think?

10:49.982 --> 10:50.900
The green or the lavender?

10:50.983 --> 10:53.986
You know, I think
maybe the yellow.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.907
{\an1}Why don't we just
leave it like this?

10:57.990 --> 10:59.575
You're kidding.

10:59.658 --> 11:00.868
{\an1}No.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.703
It's great.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.080
Avant-garde...

11:04.163 --> 11:05.706
{\an1}trash.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.583
That is enough.
Turn it off.

11:07.666 --> 11:08.209
(laughs)

11:10.002 --> 11:12.546
So, anyway, this guy I met

11:12.630 --> 11:14.423
{\an3}says he's producing some show
for the campus TV station.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.758
Come with me tomorrow, and
we'll check it out, okay?

11:15.841 --> 11:18.052
Okay.
(doorbell ringing)

11:18.135 --> 11:19.678
Oh, I'll get it.

11:22.973 --> 11:25.059
Hi.

11:25.142 --> 11:26.602
Hi, Clare.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.646
Aw, too bad you didn't
show up a minute ago.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.773
We could have videotaped
your little entrance there.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.775
Mm.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.276
Is Kelly around?

11:34.360 --> 11:35.653
{\an1}Yeah. She's in
her room studying.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.279
Thanks.

11:38.489 --> 11:40.282
Cool wall.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.077
See? Told ya.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.412
(laughing)

11:55.756 --> 11:56.799
Hi.

11:56.882 --> 12:01.470
{\an1}Hi. Getting a lot
of work done, I see.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.639
Every time I try to read
psychology at night,

12:03.722 --> 12:04.640
I fall asleep.

12:04.723 --> 12:05.224
Maybe it's my subconscious

12:05.307 --> 12:08.018
or maybe it's Freudian.

12:08.102 --> 12:11.021
Maybe it's boring.

12:11.105 --> 12:14.400
So what'd Josh's
sister give you?

12:15.568 --> 12:16.610
A sweater?

12:19.864 --> 12:20.906
If it were my friend who died,

12:20.990 --> 12:22.199
I think I'd want something

12:22.283 --> 12:23.659
a little more significant
than knitwear.

12:23.742 --> 12:25.703
What was I supposed to do?
Ask for his watch?

12:25.786 --> 12:26.954
It's just creepy.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.039
This whole thing is creepy.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.461
Why don't you come to bed?

12:34.462 --> 12:36.714
I don't feel like it.

12:36.797 --> 12:40.468
Well, then why did you come
over here at 10:00 at night?

12:42.261 --> 12:43.012
I don't know.

12:43.095 --> 12:46.015
I just didn't want to be alone.

12:46.098 --> 12:49.143
All right, then...
talk to me.

12:49.226 --> 12:51.187
{\an3}Tell me what's
going on.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.647
Kelly, I watched a friend
of mine burn to death,

12:53.731 --> 12:55.524
and the only thing I could
think of to say about him

12:55.608 --> 12:58.152
was that he was a profound
figure on campus.

12:58.235 --> 13:01.739
Brandon, I think you're being
a little hard on yourself.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.866
I just spent the last three
hours with Josh's sister.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.035
And she kept asking me:
Why Josh? Why Josh?

13:06.118 --> 13:10.706
I couldn't even
look her in the eye.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.374
It could've been me in that car!

13:12.458 --> 13:13.459
But it wasn't.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.168
But it could've been!

13:14.251 --> 13:17.713
And that's the exact same thing

13:17.796 --> 13:19.757
that Dylan said
when his father died.

13:23.761 --> 13:27.681
You know... I thought
I didn't want to be alone,

13:27.765 --> 13:29.058
but I really don't want
to talk either.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.560
{\an3}We don't have
to talk.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.770
I gotta go.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.104
Am I gonna see you tomorrow?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.411
{\an3}It's like no matter
what I say to Brandon,

13:49.495 --> 13:50.204
it's the wrong thing.

13:50.287 --> 13:51.872
I'm so horrible
at this. (sighs)

13:51.956 --> 13:52.248
It's not you.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.082
It's him.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.250
I guess.

13:54.333 --> 13:58.337
I screwed up so badly with
Dylan when his father died.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.089
{\an3}That was the beginning
of the end for us,

14:00.172 --> 14:02.550
{\an3}and I just don't want the
same thing to happen

14:02.633 --> 14:03.801
with me and Brandon.

14:03.884 --> 14:07.638
But every time I open my mouth,
I end up making him feel worse.

14:07.721 --> 14:08.973
Kelly, Brandon's not Dylan.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.225
{\an1}I'm sure you're not
making him feel worse.

14:11.308 --> 14:14.436
Andrea, you've spent more time
with him than anybody.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.230
What do I do?

14:16.313 --> 14:18.983
Look, you're talking about the
Brandon I knew in high school.

14:19.066 --> 14:21.443
{\an1}Kel, if you
haven't noticed,

14:21.527 --> 14:22.319
{\an1}we're not at
West Beverly anymore.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.280
{\an1}I mean, our lives
are totally different.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.073
Yeah, I've noticed.

14:26.156 --> 14:29.952
{\an3}Huh. Sometimes I wish
we could all just go back

14:30.035 --> 14:31.161
{\an3}and let Mrs. Teasley
fix everything.

14:31.245 --> 14:34.790
{\an1}Hmm. We thought we were
so smart then, didn't we?

14:34.873 --> 14:36.333
Yeah, and mature.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.293
Oh, where's Brenda with her

14:37.376 --> 14:39.962
{\an1}three scoops of ice cream
when we need her?

14:40.045 --> 14:46.135
{\an1}Look, the only advice
I can give you is to love him.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.137
That's all.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.847
Just love him,

14:51.390 --> 14:52.308
Yeah.

14:52.391 --> 14:53.809
Okay. I got to go.

14:53.892 --> 14:55.269
{\an3}Okay.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.312
Bye.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.485
Wow, pretty good turnout.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.113
Yeah, let's just hope they're
not all a bunch of techno-dinks

15:06.196 --> 15:08.157
sitting around and trying
to outdo each other

15:08.240 --> 15:10.659
{\an1}with bits from
<i>Mystery Science Theater.</i>

15:10.743 --> 15:13.829
{\an3}Okay, where's this guy
you've been raving about?

15:13.912 --> 15:14.580
I don't know.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.332
{\an1}He said he was
going to be here.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.667
But I'm warning you right now
that I have first dibs, okay?

15:18.751 --> 15:20.002
All right.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.338
He's really kind of cute

15:22.421 --> 15:25.549
{\an1}in a buzz-cut,
big-footed kind of way.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.676
{\an1}There he is, right there.
(clears throat loudly)

15:32.264 --> 15:35.559
{\an3}Look, I know your friend;
you can have him.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.520
Donna?!

15:38.604 --> 15:40.314
Let her go. Let her go.

15:40.397 --> 15:42.358
What's going on?

15:42.441 --> 15:44.276
It's a long story.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.487
With a real bad ending.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.197
You and Donna...?

15:48.280 --> 15:50.199
{\an1}Yeah, for a couple of years.
Since high school.

15:50.282 --> 15:55.663
{\an3}Well, I don't know how
to tell you this, but, um...

15:55.746 --> 15:57.581
I'm her new roommate.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.042
{\an1}You moved into
the beach apartment?

16:00.125 --> 16:01.377
Yeah.

16:01.460 --> 16:05.381
{\an1}That means you're...
you're in my old room.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.257
Oh, my God.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.222
{\an3}Well, at least I won't have
to give you directions right?

16:13.305 --> 16:15.641
Yeah.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.270
What are you doing here, Chief?

16:20.354 --> 16:22.898
Hannah and I thought we'd sneak
into your first Senate meeting.

16:22.981 --> 16:24.233
If that's okay?

16:24.316 --> 16:26.151
Absolutely. Come on in.

16:32.157 --> 16:33.242
Where is everybody?

16:33.325 --> 16:34.410
Beats me.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.828
I guess I should
get started, huh?

16:35.911 --> 16:38.080
{\an5}(door slamming)
BRANDON: Alex,
good to see you.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.623
Listen, Josh always
had a lot of respect...

16:39.707 --> 16:41.250
{\an3}Hey, I had nothing
against Josh,

16:41.333 --> 16:44.253
{\an6}You got something
you want to say?
Yeah.

16:44.336 --> 16:47.256
I'm leading a coalition
of senate members

16:47.339 --> 16:49.258
to challenge the legitimacy
of your presidency.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.260
On what grounds?

16:51.343 --> 16:53.303
Constitutional.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.888
The rules of succession
are not clear

16:54.972 --> 16:55.347
and have never been challenged.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.266
That's ridiculous.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.892
Tell it to a judge.

17:00.185 --> 17:03.439
(baby fussing)

17:03.522 --> 17:04.231
Shh...

17:04.314 --> 17:05.315
(door slamming)

17:05.398 --> 17:07.067
What was it you were saying

17:07.151 --> 17:08.234
about him not being
the enemy anymore?

17:08.318 --> 17:09.361
So, what are you going to do?

17:15.701 --> 17:18.078
All right, this meeting
is called to order,

17:18.162 --> 17:19.371
This meeting is adjourned.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.297
{\an5}DONNA:
You know, Clare gets me
all excited

17:28.380 --> 17:30.966
{\an3}about this video thing,
and then he shows up.

17:31.049 --> 17:33.302
{\an1}You keep saying you're over
David, and then you freak out.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.636
I am over him.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.765
{\an3}As long as I don't have
to talk to him or see him,

17:37.848 --> 17:39.391
or have anything
to do with him.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.269
Hey, get out of there!

17:42.352 --> 17:43.812
Mmm. That's
good guacamole.

17:43.896 --> 17:44.897
I guess
you didn't make it.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.315
You'd just better be happy
that we're helping you out.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.317
Hey, it's your Alpha
duty to help me out.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.152
Oh.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.321
{\an1}What's the theme
of this party, anyway?

17:52.404 --> 17:55.073
"Party till you puke."

17:55.157 --> 17:56.408
{\an1}Tasteful.
Ugh.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.912
Who's...
who's that guy?

17:59.995 --> 18:01.330
{\an1}Which guy?

18:01.413 --> 18:04.333
{\an4}DONNA:
Him, the one standing
over there. Who is he?

18:04.416 --> 18:05.292
Griffin Stone.

18:05.375 --> 18:07.169
He is gorgeous.
Mm-hmm.

18:07.252 --> 18:10.631
{\an1}KELLY:
Yeah, he's a junior.

18:10.714 --> 18:14.176
{\an1}He spent last year abroad...
in Spain, I think.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.470
He is gorgeous.

18:16.553 --> 18:17.513
{\an1}Donna, you're
repeating yourself.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.890
{\an1}Why don't you just
go talk to him?

18:19.973 --> 18:20.516
No, I couldn't.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.226
I wouldn't know what to say.

18:22.309 --> 18:25.229
Say... "Hello."

18:25.312 --> 18:26.355
Don't push me.

18:26.438 --> 18:29.775
What, would you like me
to go say hello for you?

18:29.858 --> 18:31.151
No!

18:31.235 --> 18:33.195
I mean don't you dare.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.488
All right, suit yourself.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.698
{\an1}But if it were me,
I'd say hello.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.378
{\an6}NAT:
I know you said
you weren't hungry,

18:49.461 --> 18:51.588
{\an3}but you've got to
eat something.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.507
You're as bad as my mother.

18:55.843 --> 18:56.385
(sighs)

18:59.471 --> 19:01.223
You okay, pal?

19:01.306 --> 19:03.767
I don't know.

19:06.311 --> 19:07.354
(sighs)

19:08.814 --> 19:12.734
Everyone's really going out
of their way to be nice,

19:12.818 --> 19:14.278
say the right thing
and everything,

19:14.361 --> 19:17.281
but... ever since Josh died,

19:17.364 --> 19:19.783
I feel like I don't have
a friend in the world.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.703
You got a million friends.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.746
At least six I can count.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.417
{\an3}Have you talked to
Dylan lately?

19:28.500 --> 19:29.710
He's been through this.

19:29.793 --> 19:33.338
Dylan and I aren't exactly on
the best of terms these days.

19:33.422 --> 19:36.758
Yeah, I can understand that.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.385
My silent partner's been

19:38.468 --> 19:40.679
{\an3}a little more silent
than usual lately.

19:42.389 --> 19:45.767
Nat...

19:45.851 --> 19:48.770
when you were laying on
on the floor over there,

19:48.854 --> 19:51.899
and Dylan and I were
giving you CPR,

19:51.982 --> 19:52.524
what were you thinking about?

19:54.568 --> 19:58.572
I wasn't ready to go yet.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.490
{\an3}I'm glad the man upstairs
agreed with me.

20:00.574 --> 20:03.076
Does that mean the man upstairs
had something against Josh?

20:03.160 --> 20:04.286
Of course not.

20:04.369 --> 20:05.370
Then why him and not me?

20:05.454 --> 20:08.415
Hey, you start asking
questions like that,

20:08.498 --> 20:10.208
{\an3}you're gonna drive
yourself crazy.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.545
Yeah.

20:15.881 --> 20:19.468
Brando, I'm not
gonna blow smoke.

20:19.551 --> 20:22.888
{\an3}This is gonna take
some time to get over.

20:22.971 --> 20:24.514
Maybe a week, a month...

20:24.598 --> 20:27.392
{\an3}maybe more.

20:33.190 --> 20:36.193
But you ain't never gonna
make it if you don't eat.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.822
I take it back.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.324
You're worse than my mother.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.368
Mm-hmm. Eat!

20:50.207 --> 20:50.415
Happy?

20:51.458 --> 20:53.794
Very.

20:53.877 --> 20:56.171
Keep the smile.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.092
(knocking "Shave and a Haricut")

21:03.553 --> 21:04.471
Hi.

21:04.554 --> 21:06.515
Listen, okay,

21:06.598 --> 21:07.516
just listen to me,
I'm only gonna say it once.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.018
I don't want anything
to do with anybody

21:10.102 --> 21:12.187
who lives at the Walsh house,
okay?

21:12.270 --> 21:15.357
Can I come in?

21:15.440 --> 21:16.650
(sighs)

21:16.733 --> 21:19.319
So, what kind of game were you
playing the other night?

21:19.403 --> 21:21.238
Nine ball.

21:21.321 --> 21:24.282
And I thought we were
having a pretty good time.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.618
Especially after
we left the pool hall.

21:33.583 --> 21:38.171
You know, you're the only one
in this phony town

21:38.255 --> 21:40.799
who actually comes close
to understanding me.

21:40.882 --> 21:42.843
So, Jim and Cindy
aren't cutting it?

21:42.926 --> 21:44.594
(scoffs)
Yeah, right.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.555
{\an3}They are so
squeaky clean.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.390
{\an3}And I can't believe you
went out with Brenda.

21:48.473 --> 21:52.227
I mean, she's so not you.

21:52.310 --> 21:53.729
Yeah, well, things
change, you know?

21:53.812 --> 21:55.397
People change.

21:55.480 --> 21:59.901
{\an3}You know, at my
father's funeral,

21:59.985 --> 22:04.072
{\an3}one of my pious uncles
gave me a rap about how,

22:04.156 --> 22:07.200
{\an3}uh, eggs were the
symbol of life.

22:07.284 --> 22:10.537
{\an3}And that I should eat one
as a symbolic gesture.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.750
I threw it away.

22:14.833 --> 22:15.417
You don't believe in symbolism?

22:15.500 --> 22:19.796
I don't believe in anything.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.551
So, your father's dead?

22:24.634 --> 22:25.552
Yeah.

22:30.348 --> 22:31.600
Killed himself,

22:31.683 --> 22:34.144
with a gun,

22:34.227 --> 22:35.937
in the bathroom.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.273
Yeah, my dad's dead, too.

22:38.356 --> 22:41.985
He got, uh, blown up,
by a bomb, in a car.

22:48.241 --> 22:50.160
(laughs softly)

22:50.243 --> 22:51.578
Is that why you
live here alone?

22:51.661 --> 22:55.665
No, I just like to be alone.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.003
Listen, um...

23:00.087 --> 23:02.756
I'm really sorry that I
wasn't up front with you

23:02.839 --> 23:05.133
about everything
when we met.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.302
I was just having some fun.

23:07.385 --> 23:10.055
Hey, you had your fun--
that's that.

23:10.680 --> 23:14.476
So, what does an
egg mean to you?

23:16.228 --> 23:17.979
Egg salad.

23:19.606 --> 23:21.149
You want some beer?

23:21.233 --> 23:23.318
Got anything stronger?

23:24.528 --> 23:25.654
{\an3}Sure do.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.739
(quietly):
Good.

23:36.414 --> 23:37.624
Mm! Great dress.

23:37.707 --> 23:40.460
{\an4}(groans):
Ah, I never know what
to wear to these things.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.839
Casual, dressy,
preppy, grunge.

23:43.922 --> 23:47.300
{\an5}KELLY (calling):
Donna, I want to get
there sometime this year.

23:47.384 --> 23:48.677
{\an1}Okay. I just don't know
what to wear yet.

23:48.760 --> 23:52.681
Make up your mind!
Let's go, come on!

23:52.764 --> 23:55.684
Um... I'm really sorry about
what happened this afternoon.

23:55.767 --> 23:58.228
I-I had no idea

23:58.311 --> 23:59.896
about you and David.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.189
Forget about it.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.650
I mean, how could you
possibly have known?

24:03.733 --> 24:07.362
You know, just because
you guys broke up

24:07.445 --> 24:09.322
doesn't mean
you can't work together.

24:10.782 --> 24:11.741
Donna, we're going
to the KEG house,

24:11.825 --> 24:13.535
not the White House.

24:13.618 --> 24:16.246
{\an1}Okay, just leave me alone
for one minute.

24:16.329 --> 24:18.039
{\an1}I will be right out,
I promise, okay?

24:18.123 --> 24:19.708
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hurry up.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.543
{\an3}(groans)

24:23.461 --> 24:24.880
(sighs)

24:24.963 --> 24:26.756
{\an3}Are you sure you
don't want to come?

24:26.840 --> 24:31.094
No. Greek life's a little...
theta-beta for me.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.890
So, what's the story
with Donna and David?

24:34.973 --> 24:37.392
{\an3}Irreconcilable
differences, I guess.

24:37.475 --> 24:39.853
Like what?

24:39.936 --> 24:43.607
Well, I probably shouldn't
be telling you this, but...

24:43.690 --> 24:45.734
{\an3}Donna is a virgin,
and David used to be.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.570
Oh.

24:48.653 --> 24:50.197
{\an3}Ew.
(chuckles)

24:51.531 --> 24:53.116
Okay, I'm ready to go.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.619
What-what happened
to the black dress?

24:55.702 --> 24:57.245
Why? This looks terrible?

24:57.329 --> 24:57.871
No, it doesn't.

24:57.954 --> 25:00.290
Clare, what do you think?

25:00.373 --> 25:02.584
You're stunning.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.628
{\an1}Oh, God-- I knew
I was too dressed up.

25:04.711 --> 25:06.963
{\an1}I'm just putting on
a pair of jeans.

25:07.047 --> 25:08.089
{\an1}Donna!

25:09.674 --> 25:13.345
{\an1}So, what do you think, Kel,
is it true what they say?

25:13.428 --> 25:15.305
That all's fair
in love and war?

25:15.388 --> 25:18.099
{\an3}I don't know,
I never fought a war.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.101
(both laugh)

25:20.185 --> 25:22.979
(upbeat dance music playing)

25:31.863 --> 25:33.281
Drink up, guys!

25:33.365 --> 25:34.950
You got to drink up,
because this...

25:35.033 --> 25:37.953
this is the KEG house--
in the KEG house, our motto is:

25:38.036 --> 25:39.746
Home of the free,
land of the rave.

25:39.829 --> 25:40.789
Yes!

25:40.872 --> 25:43.041
What is in this punch?

25:43.124 --> 25:45.585
Oh, oh, I can't tell,
and you can't ask.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.295
I think I like this place.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.464
Party on, guys!

25:52.175 --> 25:54.469
Brand, you made it!
Come on in. Come on.

25:54.552 --> 25:56.179
Dave, punch this man.

25:56.263 --> 25:57.681
{\an3}Thanks.

25:57.764 --> 26:00.600
{\an3}Huh?
Steve, are you insane?

26:00.684 --> 26:01.768
{\an3}You can't serve
alcohol on campus.

26:01.851 --> 26:03.812
Give me that.

26:03.895 --> 26:06.606
There's alcohol in here!

26:06.690 --> 26:08.608
Come on, Steve.
Will you lighten up?

26:08.692 --> 26:09.943
{\an1}I invited you over here
to have a party,

26:10.026 --> 26:10.944
not lecture me, all right?

26:11.027 --> 26:11.945
Now, where's Valerie?

26:12.028 --> 26:12.988
I don't know.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.322
What do you mean
you don't know?

26:14.406 --> 26:15.824
She said she was gonna get
a ride over here from you.

26:15.907 --> 26:18.994
{\an1}Why do I get the feeling
I've been stood up?

26:19.077 --> 26:20.495
I don't know.

26:20.578 --> 26:22.998
{\an4}Hey, Sanders!
(laughs):
What?

26:23.081 --> 26:25.333
{\an1}You know who this kid is?
Who is he?

26:25.417 --> 26:26.167
He's Chris Pettit's
little brother!

26:26.251 --> 26:27.669
{\an1}That's Chris Pettit's
little brother?

26:27.752 --> 26:29.170
{\an1}Yeah.
I got to go to work.

26:29.254 --> 26:30.547
{\an1}Ciao.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.924
Brandon! Oh!

26:33.008 --> 26:35.302
I'm glad you could come.

26:35.385 --> 26:37.137
{\an1}Yeah, I'm here in body,
not in spirit.

26:37.220 --> 26:37.679
That's a start.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.848
Look...

26:39.931 --> 26:41.850
I'm gonna tell
you something.

26:41.933 --> 26:44.602
I may not be able to
say the right thing

26:44.686 --> 26:45.562
or do the right thing

26:45.645 --> 26:48.231
to make you feel any
better right now, but...

26:48.315 --> 26:49.649
I'm here if you need me.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.735
And if you don't need
me, that's okay, too.

26:54.571 --> 26:56.823
That's the nicest thing
you could've said to me.

26:57.949 --> 27:00.201
Hi, guys.
(chuckles)

27:00.285 --> 27:01.911
Sorry to interrupt--
I need to talk to you, Kel.

27:01.995 --> 27:04.497
Well, what is it?

27:04.581 --> 27:05.874
Uh... in private.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.334
I'm sorry, Brandon.

27:07.417 --> 27:08.543
Ladies, go ahead.

27:08.626 --> 27:10.253
Go, go. Go.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.713
{\an3}What? What?
He's here.

27:11.796 --> 27:14.174
{\an1}Who?!
Griffin Stone.

27:14.257 --> 27:16.426
{\an6}Donna, he
lives here.
(groans)

27:16.509 --> 27:17.719
{\an5}DONNA:
Oh, my God,
he's right over there.

27:17.802 --> 27:20.555
You know what, I think
I'm getting weak in the knees.

27:20.638 --> 27:21.097
You'd better pull
yourself together,

27:21.181 --> 27:21.890
because here he comes!

27:21.973 --> 27:22.974
Oh, my God.

27:25.602 --> 27:27.228
Hi, Kelly.
Hi, Griffin.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.064
{\an1}Uh, we really haven't
been introduced.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.316
I'm Griffin Stone.

27:31.399 --> 27:33.902
Hi. I'm Donna... Martin.

27:33.985 --> 27:35.695
Would you like to dance?

27:35.779 --> 27:35.987
Me?

27:36.071 --> 27:38.031
Yeah.

27:38.114 --> 27:39.574
Okay.

27:39.657 --> 27:39.908
Go.

27:39.991 --> 27:42.744
Okay.

27:50.377 --> 27:52.087
(doorbell rings)

27:54.839 --> 27:55.924
Hi.

27:56.007 --> 27:58.051
Hi.

27:59.719 --> 28:01.221
Well, don't just
stand there,

28:01.304 --> 28:02.722
come on in.

28:02.806 --> 28:05.100
Donna and Kelly
aren't here, are they?

28:05.183 --> 28:05.934
No.

28:06.017 --> 28:08.561
The coast is clear.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.900
What'd you do to the wall?

28:13.983 --> 28:16.653
You don't like it?

28:16.736 --> 28:19.114
No. It's... it's great.

28:19.197 --> 28:21.658
It's just a little
weird being here.

28:21.741 --> 28:23.660
Well, we don't have to stay.

28:23.743 --> 28:25.954
{\an1}Let's go get something to eat
or something-- I'm starved.

28:26.037 --> 28:26.788
{\an3}(sighing):
Look, maybe...

28:26.871 --> 28:29.290
{\an3}we shouldn't
be doing this.

28:29.374 --> 28:32.669
I thought I could,
but maybe I can't.

28:32.752 --> 28:34.671
{\an3}I just don't want
to hurt Donna.

28:34.754 --> 28:37.006
I've done enough
of that already.

28:37.090 --> 28:41.636
You know, I... I think
you're a really nice guy, David.

28:41.719 --> 28:43.638
I don't know exactly

28:43.721 --> 28:46.850
what happened between
you and Donna, but...

28:46.933 --> 28:49.894
{\an1}I do know there's
three sides to every story.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.855
And then there's the truth.

28:51.938 --> 28:56.651
{\an3}The truth is,
I acted like a jerk.

28:56.734 --> 28:57.986
The only way I can

28:58.069 --> 29:00.405
live with myself is
if I don't do this.

29:01.823 --> 29:05.743
{\an1}Then you'd better...
get out of here.

29:05.827 --> 29:07.996
{\an1}I'm not very good
at being good.

29:14.085 --> 29:16.963
Of all the three-bedroom
apartments in all the world,

29:17.046 --> 29:18.923
why'd you have to pick this one?

29:21.092 --> 29:22.886
Location, location, location.

29:30.768 --> 29:31.895
(door closes)

29:31.978 --> 29:34.022
(romantic ballad playing)

29:40.487 --> 29:42.655
It's a good thing I didn't
meet you my freshman year.

29:42.739 --> 29:43.865
Why?

29:43.948 --> 29:45.867
Well, I never would have
taken a year abroad.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.036
Oh, don't tease me.

29:48.119 --> 29:50.455
{\an1}Oh, I'm not teasing--
I mean it.

29:50.538 --> 29:52.207
{\an1}I spent a whole year
in Barcelona,

29:52.290 --> 29:54.209
and I didn't go out
with a single girl

29:54.292 --> 29:55.960
who could dance
as well as you.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.670
Mm, thank you.

29:57.754 --> 30:00.381
So... what else
are you good at?

30:00.465 --> 30:03.092
{\an1}What?
Oh, roller-blading,

30:03.176 --> 30:05.428
{\an1}hang-gliding,
hundred-meter freestyle--

30:05.512 --> 30:07.180
what's your best event?
(giggling)

30:07.263 --> 30:09.682
{\an3}You know, I'm not really
the outdoor type.

30:09.766 --> 30:12.727
{\an1}Oh. So, how do you feel
about indoor sports?

30:12.810 --> 30:13.937
Thanks for the dance, Griffin.

30:14.020 --> 30:16.731
{\an1}Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.

30:16.814 --> 30:18.191
{\an1}Did I just say
something wrong?

30:18.274 --> 30:19.567
No, not at all.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.194
{\an3}Look, if you're looking
for a wild night,

30:21.277 --> 30:22.862
I'm not your girl, okay?

30:22.946 --> 30:24.030
{\an1}Hey, I'm sorry--
I was just kidding around.

30:24.113 --> 30:27.033
I'd like to get
to know you better.

30:27.116 --> 30:28.910
Really.

30:31.454 --> 30:33.081
{\an3}Even... if I tell
you right now

30:33.164 --> 30:35.917
that I'm a good
Catholic girl?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.585
Then we're made for each other.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.128
I'm a good Catholic boy.

30:39.212 --> 30:42.632
You are?

30:42.715 --> 30:44.259
{\an1}You want to test me
on my catechisms?

30:44.342 --> 30:46.261
No.

30:46.344 --> 30:49.138
I just want to
dance with you.

30:51.015 --> 30:54.727
{\an5}PLEDGES:
♪ 99 bottles of beer
in the frat ♪

30:54.811 --> 30:56.104
♪ 99 bottles of beer ♪

30:56.187 --> 30:58.898
♪ You take one down,
and you pass it around... ♪

31:00.400 --> 31:01.901
(loud whooping)

31:01.985 --> 31:04.028
Would you guys shut up!

31:04.112 --> 31:06.656
{\an3}What's the matter?!
Don't you like beer?!

31:06.739 --> 31:09.367
Beers all around, guys!

31:09.450 --> 31:10.785
Drink up!

31:10.868 --> 31:11.411
(laughs)

31:11.494 --> 31:14.622
Oh, no, we've
got company.

31:20.211 --> 31:23.381
Campus security's outside.
Aw, damn!

31:23.464 --> 31:25.425
{\an3}Marty's out there stalling
them, but there's no way

31:25.508 --> 31:27.802
{\an3}we're gonna be able to hide
all the booze in here.

31:27.885 --> 31:28.803
Muntz, what am I gonna do?

31:28.886 --> 31:32.765
The party was your idea,
man-- you figure it out.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.147
Ah, Brandon.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.150
I hate to say
I told you so.

31:42.233 --> 31:43.151
You can yell at me later.

31:43.234 --> 31:45.153
Right now I need your help.

31:45.236 --> 31:47.405
{\an4}STEVE:
Good evening, Officer.
Can I help you?

31:47.488 --> 31:48.781
Who are you?

31:48.865 --> 31:50.116
I'm Steve.

31:50.199 --> 31:51.951
Uh, Steve Sanders.
Pledge master.

31:52.035 --> 31:54.120
{\an3}Well, Mr. Pledge Master,
maybe you can tell me

31:54.203 --> 31:58.207
why it is that this house
is always our first stop?

31:58.291 --> 32:01.377
(nervous chuckle)
I don't know.

32:01.461 --> 32:02.837
{\an3}Well, I don't know
what else you're serving,

32:02.920 --> 32:03.546
{\an3}but you got beer cans
all over your lawn.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.006
I know,
this is disgusting.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.299
{\an3}It's against the law
on this campus.

32:06.382 --> 32:08.176
{\an3}You mind if we come in,
look around inside?

32:08.259 --> 32:09.677
{\an1}Sir, uh, my name's
Brandon Walsh.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.679
{\an1}I'm the president
of the student body here.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.848
{\an1}I came down to break up
the party myself.

32:13.931 --> 32:14.641
{\an3}STEVE &amp; OFFICER:
You did?

32:14.724 --> 32:15.683
You did.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.769
{\an1}Yes, sir, yes, sir.
Steve, uh, called me.

32:17.852 --> 32:20.229
He didn't really know
what to do. He invited

32:20.313 --> 32:22.190
a lot of pledges here tonight,
and it seems some of the men

32:22.273 --> 32:24.192
might have, uh, brought
their own booze with them.

32:24.275 --> 32:26.069
So you're saying
you didn't serve alcohol here?

32:26.152 --> 32:28.029
Absolutely, uh, not.

32:28.112 --> 32:30.865
Steve made it quite clear
that it was a dry party,

32:30.948 --> 32:33.701
sir, but what are you gonna do,
frisk everyone on their way in?

32:33.785 --> 32:34.994
(nervous chuckle)

32:35.078 --> 32:36.079
{\an3}(sighs)

32:36.162 --> 32:38.206
Look, it's late;
I've worked a long day.

32:38.289 --> 32:41.042
Do me a favor,
make sure everybody

32:41.125 --> 32:42.085
gets home safe, will you?

32:42.168 --> 32:43.336
Yeah, sure.

32:43.419 --> 32:45.338
{\an1}Take their keys,
tie 'em up if you have to--

32:45.421 --> 32:46.214
{\an1}I don't want to see
anyone get hurt.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.174
{\an1}Thank you.
Thank you.

32:48.257 --> 32:49.676
Thank you, sir.
And I sure

32:49.759 --> 32:51.678
don't want to have
to come back here again.

32:51.761 --> 32:53.221
{\an6}Do you
understand me?
Yes, yes, sir.

32:58.309 --> 33:00.228
{\an3}Dude, it is so good to have
friends in high places.

33:00.311 --> 33:01.688
{\an1}Don't ever put me
in that position again,

33:01.771 --> 33:03.106
do you understand me, Steve?

33:03.189 --> 33:04.899
{\an3}Hey, quit it, man--
we're here to have fun.

33:04.982 --> 33:07.026
{\an3}This is a party--
let's party.

33:13.783 --> 33:16.911
{\an3}So, weren't you supposed to
go to some party tonight?

33:16.994 --> 33:19.789
Mm. I like this party better.

33:26.379 --> 33:29.090
{\an1}So I've been
in your bed all day,

33:29.173 --> 33:32.427
{\an1}told you all my deepest,
darkest secrets,

33:32.510 --> 33:35.430
{\an1}but you haven't
told me any of yours.

33:35.513 --> 33:38.766
I don't have any secrets.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.519
So, what I see
is what I get?

33:42.311 --> 33:44.105
What do you see?

33:44.188 --> 33:48.192
Poor little rich boy
from Beverly Hills.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.403
Yeah, right.

33:50.486 --> 33:51.988
And what are you?

33:52.071 --> 33:53.614
The innocent lamb from
the wilds of Buffalo,

33:53.698 --> 33:57.410
{\an3}out here staying with
Uncle Jim and Aunt Cindy?

33:57.493 --> 33:59.746
I'm not that innocent.

33:59.829 --> 34:01.372
Uh-uh.

34:09.213 --> 34:13.634
{\an3}Listen. Whatever happens
in here between me and you,

34:13.717 --> 34:15.344
{\an3}I don't want it hitting the
information superhighway.

34:15.428 --> 34:17.764
{\an3}Got it?

34:17.847 --> 34:18.264
<i>Capisce.</i>

34:18.347 --> 34:20.475
{\an3}Okay.

34:20.558 --> 34:21.391
{\an3}'Cause, if you're looking
for a boyfriend--

34:21.476 --> 34:23.643
{\an3}you know, I mean,
somebody that will like,

34:23.728 --> 34:27.315
come over and take you out
on a date... I'm not him.

34:27.398 --> 34:30.902
So no miniature golf
in the near future?

34:30.985 --> 34:33.237
Not hardly.

34:33.321 --> 34:34.405
{\an1}(chuckles)

34:34.489 --> 34:39.659
Listen, I'm not looking
for a boyfriend, Dylan.

34:39.744 --> 34:41.496
At least, not here.
Mm-mnh.

34:41.579 --> 34:46.000
{\an3}So what's going on with you
and Steve Sanders? Hmm?

34:46.083 --> 34:48.543
{\an1}(sighs)
Not much.

34:48.628 --> 34:51.339
{\an3}Yeah, well, good.
Let's keep it that way.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.174
Steve's an old friend of mine.

34:53.257 --> 34:56.969
I'd hate to see him get burned.

34:57.053 --> 34:59.388
Steve's a big boy, Dylan.

34:59.472 --> 35:01.516
If he doesn't like fire,

35:01.599 --> 35:03.309
{\an1}he shouldn't be playing
with matches.

35:03.392 --> 35:05.478
Listen to you.

35:05.561 --> 35:06.229
You are a bad girl.

35:06.312 --> 35:10.274
{\an1}Oh, depends on
who you talk to.

35:19.242 --> 35:21.244
(jukebox playing pop ballad)

35:22.620 --> 35:27.375
Valerie, what happened
to you Saturday night?

35:27.458 --> 35:28.876
You missed the party.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.170
I know. I'm sorry, um....

35:31.254 --> 35:33.548
I really wanted to go,
but I was really tired.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.341
It must be the time change.

35:35.424 --> 35:37.260
Valerie, you've been
living in California

35:37.343 --> 35:38.845
for almost a month now.

35:38.928 --> 35:39.637
{\an3}Don't you know
what time it is yet?

35:39.720 --> 35:43.307
I'm sorry. Let me
make it up to you.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.273
{\an1}STEVE:
Hey, Dylan. How you been?

35:50.356 --> 35:51.858
I haven't seen
you in a while.

35:51.941 --> 35:52.984
Yeah. Better once
I get some coffee in me.

35:53.067 --> 35:54.819
{\an3}Hey, Nat.
Hey, McKay.

35:56.821 --> 35:58.281
You look lousy.

35:58.364 --> 36:00.366
{\an3}(coughs)
Yeah. Same to you.

36:01.492 --> 36:04.245
Have you met Dylan?

36:04.328 --> 36:05.705
No. I don't think so.

36:05.788 --> 36:06.873
Valerie Malone.
Dylan McKay.

36:06.956 --> 36:08.416
Nice to meet you.

36:08.499 --> 36:11.043
Valerie's living
in the Walsh house.

36:11.127 --> 36:13.796
{\an3}Yeah. I heard
something about that.

36:15.381 --> 36:18.092
So, about you standing me up.

36:18.175 --> 36:19.594
Way I figure it, you owe me one.

36:19.677 --> 36:22.388
Do you like
to play miniature golf?

36:25.850 --> 36:27.268
(sighs)

36:27.351 --> 36:28.352
(Steven chuckling)

36:29.604 --> 36:30.813
(doorbell chimes)

36:30.897 --> 36:32.273
Well, there they are.

36:32.356 --> 36:34.275
{\an3}Wait, wait. Let me see
that million-dollar smile.

36:34.358 --> 36:35.610
I hate this.
Oh...

36:35.693 --> 36:37.111
Fix your hair
a little bit.

36:37.194 --> 36:39.447
{\an1}Mom, don't.
Just answer the door.

36:41.032 --> 36:41.699
Nannette, hi!

36:41.782 --> 36:43.701
{\an3}Felice, so good
to see you.

36:43.784 --> 36:45.244
Thank you. Come in.

36:45.328 --> 36:45.953
You know Donna.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.289
{\an6}Of course.
Hello, dear.
Hi.

36:48.372 --> 36:49.123
You know, I didn't see

36:49.206 --> 36:51.417
my son's car out front.
Is he here?

36:51.500 --> 36:52.919
No. Not yet.

36:53.002 --> 36:54.629
{\an3}Oh, darn. He promised me
he wouldn't be late.

36:54.712 --> 36:56.964
Well, come on in and sit down.

36:57.048 --> 37:00.134
I have found the most wonderful
fat-free muffins

37:00.217 --> 37:01.469
for us to indulge in.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.554
(doorbell chimes)

37:03.638 --> 37:05.306
{\an1}Oh, good.
That must be him now.

37:05.389 --> 37:06.515
Honey, why don't you
go ahead and get it?

37:06.599 --> 37:07.892
Sure.

37:13.397 --> 37:14.982
Griffin?

37:15.066 --> 37:16.359
Surprise.

37:16.609 --> 37:18.361
You're Nannette's son?

37:18.444 --> 37:20.488
The last time
I checked my birth certificate.

37:20.571 --> 37:22.448
You jerk.

37:22.531 --> 37:23.991
You knew exactly who

37:24.075 --> 37:26.035
I was last night, and you didn't
even say anything.

37:26.577 --> 37:29.497
You were checking me out.

37:29.580 --> 37:30.498
{\an3}Who, me?

37:30.581 --> 37:33.501
You know, I don't even know

37:33.584 --> 37:35.503
if I should let you in.
You're right.

37:35.586 --> 37:38.005
Why should we sit around sipping
tea with our maternal units

37:38.089 --> 37:39.632
when we could hit the beach?

37:41.384 --> 37:42.635
You mean just leave?

37:42.718 --> 37:44.136
No. I mean we'll

37:44.220 --> 37:46.555
say some polite good-byes,
and then we'll leave.

37:46.639 --> 37:49.433
Hmm.

37:53.521 --> 37:57.066
{\an1}So the university's legal
counsel has advised me that,

37:57.149 --> 38:00.403
unless we're careful, we could
wind up in court over this.

38:00.486 --> 38:02.238
So am I president or not?

38:02.321 --> 38:04.615
Technically,
you're the acting president

38:04.699 --> 38:06.534
until this challenge plays out.

38:06.617 --> 38:08.536
I'm afraid you're a bit
of a lame duck.

38:08.619 --> 38:10.538
Well, why don't I make things
easier on everyone

38:10.621 --> 38:11.497
and just resign?

38:11.580 --> 38:14.250
I mean, they elected
Josh President, not me.

38:14.333 --> 38:15.710
{\an1}Let's just let things
take their course.

38:15.793 --> 38:18.546
Situations like this settle down
with a little bit of time.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.506
Hang in there with me.

38:20.589 --> 38:23.926
{\an1}That's the best way
to honor Josh's memory.

38:26.512 --> 38:27.888
I guess so.

38:27.972 --> 38:30.057
Good. Good. That's what
I wanted you to say.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.560
By the way, I heard you helped
smooth over a situation

38:32.643 --> 38:35.187
at the KEG house
the other night.

38:35.271 --> 38:39.567
{\an3}Yeah. I hope I didn't
overstep my bounds.

38:39.650 --> 38:40.526
No, no. Not at all.

38:40.609 --> 38:43.946
{\an1}Let's just make sure
your friend Mr. Sanders

38:44.030 --> 38:45.740
toes the mark from now on.

38:45.823 --> 38:46.574
You can count on that.

38:46.657 --> 38:47.575
So, how are things

38:47.658 --> 38:49.535
between you and Clare?

38:51.495 --> 38:53.748
Fine.

38:53.831 --> 38:54.582
{\an1}Actually, she's
taken an apartment

38:54.665 --> 38:56.876
with some close
friends of mine.

38:56.959 --> 38:57.752
Yes, I know. I'm thrilled.

38:57.835 --> 39:01.630
You know, Clare is
very fond of you.

39:01.714 --> 39:05.426
Well, you know how I feel
about your daughter, sir.

39:05.509 --> 39:08.262
{\an3}Well, if you need anything,
Brandon, just call.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.347
{\an5}Anything at all.
All right?
Thank you.

39:13.476 --> 39:15.311
{\an5}CLARE:
<i>Anyway, I was thinking</i>
<i>we could start on this shot</i>

39:15.394 --> 39:17.480
here, and then we could segue

39:17.563 --> 39:20.107
into some computer animation
over here,

39:20.191 --> 39:22.902
and then finish off
with music down here.

39:22.985 --> 39:23.444
Is that good?

39:23.527 --> 39:25.780
Yeah. I like that.

39:25.863 --> 39:28.282
{\an3}That's a good idea.
That'll work.

39:28.365 --> 39:31.619
You know, I haven't had
a strictly platonic relationship

39:31.702 --> 39:37.249
since I was, like, 13 years old.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.794
It's not that bad actually.

39:40.586 --> 39:42.755
Oh.

39:42.838 --> 39:44.465
DONNA: Hi.
Hi.

39:44.548 --> 39:47.343
Donna, hi.

39:47.426 --> 39:48.469
Oh, we were
just, um...

39:48.552 --> 39:50.429
{\an1}working on the storyboard
for the video.

39:50.513 --> 39:52.515
Oh! That's great.
So, uh, how's it going?

39:52.598 --> 39:55.768
Uh... well...

39:55.851 --> 39:56.811
Look, you guys.

39:56.894 --> 39:58.813
I've been thinking a lot
about it.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.356
We can work together.

40:00.439 --> 40:02.358
We can?
Absolutely.

40:02.441 --> 40:04.527
You know, there is no reason
why we can't be friends.

40:04.610 --> 40:05.611
That's great.

40:05.694 --> 40:07.988
What changed your mind?

40:08.072 --> 40:10.449
I finally found
a parking space.

40:10.533 --> 40:11.826
{\an3}Oh, good.

40:11.909 --> 40:13.661
{\an3}Oh, you guys haven't
met yet, have you?

40:13.744 --> 40:15.913
No, we haven't.

40:15.996 --> 40:17.123
Clare Arnold.

40:17.206 --> 40:18.958
{\an3}David Silver.
This is Griffin Stone.

40:19.041 --> 40:20.292
Nice to meet you.

40:20.376 --> 40:22.044
Hi.
Hi.

40:22.128 --> 40:24.547
{\an3}Griffin, you can come
change in my room.

40:33.764 --> 40:35.516
What are we going to do
if we actually win this thing?

40:35.599 --> 40:38.769
Make it up as we go along.

40:54.285 --> 40:54.869
(knocking on door)

40:57.454 --> 41:00.499
Honey, are you all right?

41:01.667 --> 41:04.170
No.

41:04.253 --> 41:06.213
Well, there's someone here
to see you.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.590
I don't want to see anyone.

41:07.673 --> 41:10.426
It's Josh's sister.

41:14.805 --> 41:17.308
Gloria.

41:17.391 --> 41:19.101
Hi.
Hi.

41:19.185 --> 41:20.686
{\an1}You want to come in
and sit down?

41:20.769 --> 41:21.562
Oh, no. No, thanks
I can't stay long.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.772
{\an3}I'm on my way
to the airport.

41:23.856 --> 41:24.607
{\an3}But my mother
sent me something

41:24.690 --> 41:27.526
{\an3}that she thought
you'd want to see.

41:27.610 --> 41:30.571
It's a letter from Josh.

41:30.654 --> 41:31.614
{\an3}He wrote it the day
before he died,

41:31.697 --> 41:34.533
and I think you
should read it.

41:42.333 --> 41:45.377
"Dear Mom, I don't
have much time to write

41:45.461 --> 41:47.463
"because the election
is tomorrow.

41:47.546 --> 41:49.965
"Chances are,
I'm not going to win.

41:50.049 --> 41:54.553
"But even if I lose, I've won
because I've found a new friend.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.513
"A real friend.

41:56.597 --> 41:57.598
"Believe it or not,
a WASP from Minnesota

41:57.681 --> 42:00.893
"named Brandon Walsh.

42:00.976 --> 42:04.396
"He's a great guy,
and the truth of the matter is,

42:04.480 --> 42:06.607
"last year,
we were so competitive

42:06.690 --> 42:08.901
"that we practically tried
to kill each other.

42:08.984 --> 42:11.111
"But now we're on the same team,
and it's a good thing,

42:11.195 --> 42:11.779
"because if he were
running against me,

42:11.862 --> 42:15.616
"I'd have to vote for him.

42:15.699 --> 42:18.619
"Everyone knows he'd make
a better president than I would.

42:18.702 --> 42:21.455
"You always said that college

42:21.538 --> 42:23.123
{\an3}"is really about finding
those few people

42:23.207 --> 42:25.834
"who you'll know and love
for the rest of your life.

42:25.918 --> 42:29.838
"Well, I think I found one.

42:29.922 --> 42:32.341
"Talk to you soon.

42:32.424 --> 42:34.426
Love, Joshua."

42:37.554 --> 42:38.973
Wow.

42:39.056 --> 42:41.642
I hated him.

42:41.725 --> 42:43.477
When I first met

42:43.560 --> 42:45.145
Josh Richland, I thought

42:45.229 --> 42:48.691
I'd never met a bigger jerk
in my entire life.

42:48.774 --> 42:52.653
But I was wrong.

42:53.737 --> 42:55.823
I never got a chance
to tell him that.

42:55.906 --> 43:00.536
He knew.
That's why he wrote that letter.

43:00.619 --> 43:03.455
You know...

43:03.539 --> 43:07.960
{\an3}Josh and I talked
about doing great things

43:08.043 --> 43:10.337
if we got elected.

43:10.421 --> 43:12.548
{\an1}Brandon,
you <i> did</i> get elected.

43:12.631 --> 43:14.967
You're right.

43:17.428 --> 43:18.887
I'm not going to give that up
without a fight.

43:19.930 --> 43:21.849
I can't.

43:21.932 --> 43:26.854
Otherwise, it might as well have
been both of us in that car.

43:26.937 --> 43:29.481
Don't even say that.

43:33.110 --> 43:34.778
I love you, Kelly.

43:34.862 --> 43:38.615
I love you.
