WEBVTT

00:12.969 --> 00:15.798
I heard the singing down
the hall. Whose birthday was it?

00:15.798 --> 00:18.888
Oh, I don't know.
I wasn't there.

00:22.892 --> 00:23.893
<i>♪ Happy birthday... ♪</i>

00:23.893 --> 00:25.590
It's not my birthday.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.463
So, there was another
office gathering

00:28.463 --> 00:29.899
to which I was not invited?

00:29.899 --> 00:31.683
Well, yes, but think of all
the good you're doing.

00:31.683 --> 00:34.425
If not for you,
there wouldn't be an in-crowd.

00:34.425 --> 00:35.905
I can't believe
I'm having such a hard time

00:35.905 --> 00:38.777
fitting in at Harvard.

00:38.777 --> 00:40.518
Kind of hard to fall back
on the old line,

00:40.518 --> 00:43.043
"They're just intimidated
by your intellect."

00:43.043 --> 00:45.915
Don't take it personally.
You're still new.

00:45.915 --> 00:48.309
Besides, no one else we know
was at the party.

00:48.309 --> 00:49.962
Alan, there you are.

00:49.962 --> 00:52.052
There's ice cream, too?

00:52.052 --> 00:53.662
I was just delivered something

00:53.662 --> 00:56.752
that made me fly over here.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.232
Interesting,

00:58.232 --> 01:00.669
because I, too,
received something that, uh,

01:00.669 --> 01:03.237
would be a real
feather in my cap.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.718
So, if you got the flu...?

01:06.718 --> 01:09.504
It would be avian in nature.

01:09.504 --> 01:12.724
I'm gonna freak out
if I'm not included real soon.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.249
I got the golden plume.

01:15.249 --> 01:16.511
I, too, was plumed.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.384
"You've been cordially invited
to attend

01:20.384 --> 01:21.907
"the Founders' Society mixer.

01:21.907 --> 01:24.301
Join the president and fellows
of Harvard University."

01:25.650 --> 01:26.782
What is this?

01:26.782 --> 01:28.827
It's no big deal. It's just

01:28.827 --> 01:31.352
an extremely selective group
of Harvard's brightest minds

01:31.352 --> 01:33.223
who help shape the
university's future.

01:33.223 --> 01:35.225
I'm kidding,
it's a very big deal.

01:35.225 --> 01:36.792
I heard, in their cellar,

01:36.792 --> 01:37.967
they have a bottle of Scotch

01:37.967 --> 01:41.362
from Shackleton's
1917 expedition.

01:41.362 --> 01:42.885
What I wouldn't give

01:42.885 --> 01:45.931
to have a piece of history
like that burn my esophagus.

01:45.931 --> 01:47.803
Every Harvard president

01:47.803 --> 01:49.979
started out as a member
of the Founders' Society.

01:49.979 --> 01:52.547
Oh, my sister's
gonna be so jealous.

01:53.591 --> 01:54.984
Text Monica.

01:54.984 --> 01:57.378
"I'm about to be president."

01:57.378 --> 01:59.597
"I'm about to be pregnant."

02:00.685 --> 02:02.948
Eh, she'll still
be jealous. Send.

02:02.948 --> 02:04.515
You know, this is
what's wrong with academia.

02:04.515 --> 02:05.734
Look at the two of you,

02:05.734 --> 02:07.475
acting like a couple
of giddy children

02:07.475 --> 02:09.868
because of an invitation for
some pretentious, elitist clique

02:09.868 --> 02:11.783
that just had to...

02:20.227 --> 02:22.490
I got a golden plume.

02:22.490 --> 02:23.882
We all got a plume.

02:23.882 --> 02:27.234
I've got a plume. Oh, my God.

02:31.542 --> 02:32.674
Oh, there they are.

02:32.674 --> 02:34.719
- I'll get it.
- Thank you, Freddy.

02:35.416 --> 02:37.331
- Hey.
- Hey.
My,

02:37.331 --> 02:38.854
you look ravishing.

02:38.854 --> 02:41.726
Well, I tried something fun
with my hair.

02:42.510 --> 02:44.686
Oh, this is so exciting.
The three of us together.

02:44.686 --> 02:46.296
Aren't you all

02:46.296 --> 02:48.994
competing against each other
to get into that club?

02:48.994 --> 02:51.649
Technically, yes,
but we've gamed the system

02:51.649 --> 02:53.216
by forming an alliance.

02:54.522 --> 02:56.306
See, working together allows you

02:56.306 --> 02:58.874
to brag about one other,
which is endearing,

02:58.874 --> 03:00.702
but when you brag
about yourself, it's obnoxious.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.747
Yes, the whole thing
was my idea.

03:03.705 --> 03:06.708
It's a brilliant idea.
I mean, with my connections,

03:06.708 --> 03:09.711
Dr. Crane's celebrity,
and also Alan,

03:09.711 --> 03:12.583
um, we're shoo-ins
for the Founders' Society.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.585
"The Founders' Society."

03:14.585 --> 03:16.326
Isn't this whole thing
just a little pretentious?

03:16.326 --> 03:17.719
- Yes, of course it is.
- Absolutely.
- Very much so.

03:17.719 --> 03:18.937
Look, and we all have

03:18.937 --> 03:20.635
very good reasons
for wanting to get in.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.332
I mean, I for one would like
to find a place

03:22.332 --> 03:23.681
where I feel like I belong.

03:23.681 --> 03:26.554
- Scotch-related gluttony for me.
- Mm.

03:26.554 --> 03:28.599
Naked ambition here.

03:28.599 --> 03:32.342
Here we are. Champagne.
Plus, it gives

03:32.342 --> 03:33.474
Alan and I an opportunity

03:33.474 --> 03:36.390
to exorcise some demons.

03:36.390 --> 03:39.523
Ah, yes,
the Bullingdon Club incident.

03:39.523 --> 03:42.265
A classic story.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.875
It was back when we were both
attending Oxford.

03:43.875 --> 03:46.269
We tried to get into
their most exclusive club,

03:46.269 --> 03:47.270
and while we were pledging...

03:47.270 --> 03:48.489
You got lights-out drunk

03:48.489 --> 03:50.491
and snuck into the library.

03:50.491 --> 03:52.623
Freddy, please.

03:52.623 --> 03:54.582
Olivia and Eve
have not heard this story.

03:54.582 --> 03:56.932
So, once we were inebriated,

03:56.932 --> 03:59.369
we thought we would sneak into
the library and try to steal...

03:59.369 --> 04:01.284
Oscar Wilde's walking stick.

04:01.284 --> 04:04.766
Olivia, please.
Eve has not heard this story.

04:04.766 --> 04:08.509
So, once we absconded
with the stick we were...

04:08.509 --> 04:11.729
Tackled by a pack
of surprisingly spry librarians

04:11.729 --> 04:13.644
and forever banned
from the club.

04:13.644 --> 04:15.864
It was my darkest hour.

04:15.864 --> 04:19.607
I do not sound like that.

04:20.738 --> 04:21.957
So, you've all heard this story?

04:21.957 --> 04:23.306
Dad,

04:23.306 --> 04:25.439
you and Alan have five stories.

04:25.439 --> 04:28.877
No, no. Have you heard
the one about...

04:28.877 --> 04:30.835
we tried to rescue a poodle...

04:30.835 --> 04:33.621
...from the deck of a catamaran,
and we ended up...

04:33.621 --> 04:35.753
Naked in Denmark.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.409
You know, you tell these stories
so often that I'm afraid

04:39.409 --> 04:41.237
that John's first words
are gonna be...

04:41.237 --> 04:42.717
"And that crazy drunk chick

04:42.717 --> 04:45.328
turned out to be
Princess Margaret."

04:45.328 --> 04:47.635
I apologize for the humiliation

04:47.635 --> 04:49.898
I'm about to inflict
on you, Eve,

04:49.898 --> 04:52.335
but you're doing
an East Sussex accent,

04:52.335 --> 04:53.815
and I come from West Sussex.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.818
Ooh, Alan, zing.

04:56.818 --> 05:00.300
Oh.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.823
Our chariot awaits. Here we go.

05:01.823 --> 05:04.260
All right, well,
you kids have fun.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.741
Don't eat anything endangered.

05:08.395 --> 05:09.744
You really do look fabulous.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.702
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

05:13.617 --> 05:16.838
Oh, David. Hello. See you soon.

05:20.363 --> 05:22.234
What is up, cousin?

05:23.105 --> 05:26.500
Oh, you know, just excited
about a quiet night in

05:26.500 --> 05:28.676
at home, by myself.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.852
I like the sound of that.
I'll join you.

05:32.767 --> 05:35.291
So what is up

05:35.291 --> 05:37.380
in Freddy Land?

05:38.686 --> 05:41.471
Is there a-a Mrs. Freddy
on the horizon?

05:42.516 --> 05:44.866
Nope. No girlfriend
at the moment.

05:44.866 --> 05:45.997
That's a shame.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.434
- Mm.
- You sure there's nothing

05:47.434 --> 05:48.609
going on between you and Eve?

05:48.609 --> 05:51.481
- What? No.
- Why not?

05:51.481 --> 05:52.743
I mean, you have
all this history,

05:52.743 --> 05:54.441
you've lived together
for a while.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.660
Also, you've seen each other
in your pajamas.

05:57.792 --> 06:01.752
David, you know she used to date
my buddy before he...

06:01.752 --> 06:03.624
Trust me,
nothing can happen there.

06:03.624 --> 06:06.540
Cool, cool. Smart.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.630
In that case,
I'm gonna ask her out.

06:09.630 --> 06:12.415
What? No. You can't ask her out.

06:12.415 --> 06:13.938
Got it. You love her.
I'll back off.

06:14.591 --> 06:17.812
Okay, David.
Please listen to me.

06:17.812 --> 06:20.510
I don't have any feelings
for Eve.

06:20.510 --> 06:22.425
Okay? We're just friends.

06:22.425 --> 06:24.906
Understood.
I'm clear for takeoff.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.777
No. Oh, my God.
Y-You're a teenager.

06:26.777 --> 06:29.563
She's almost 30. Her boyfriend
died barely a year ago.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.434
She has a baby
you're not even allowed to hold.

06:31.434 --> 06:33.480
A baby I'm afraid to hold.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.656
And trust me,

06:35.656 --> 06:37.701
she wants this.

06:38.310 --> 06:40.835
You know what? Go for it.

06:40.835 --> 06:42.663
Ask her out. See what happens.

06:42.663 --> 06:44.795
- Thank you for your blessing.
- Mm-hmm.

06:46.493 --> 06:49.278
Eve, what a lovely surprise.

06:49.278 --> 06:51.454
Why? I live here.

06:54.718 --> 06:58.374
What? Are you serious?

06:58.374 --> 07:00.855
He cleared you for takeoff?

07:09.646 --> 07:13.389
This place is so stuffy.

07:14.346 --> 07:17.175
I love it.

07:17.175 --> 07:19.395
Looks like the sort of place
you retire to

07:19.395 --> 07:21.441
after a long day hunting man.

07:23.747 --> 07:26.663
Okay, every second counts.

07:26.663 --> 07:28.404
We have two hours
to meet and impress

07:28.404 --> 07:29.753
as many members as possible,

07:29.753 --> 07:31.494
after which they will
get together and vote

07:31.494 --> 07:33.322
to select the new inductees.

07:33.322 --> 07:34.584
The most important person

07:34.584 --> 07:36.673
is the chair of the econ
department, Dean Melvin.

07:36.673 --> 07:39.546
He is the head of the society.

07:42.374 --> 07:43.637
What are you doing?

07:43.637 --> 07:45.813
I'm trying on a priceless
antique gauntlet.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.989
- What's it look like I'm doing?
- Why?

07:47.989 --> 07:50.905
Because the helmet
would mess up my hair.

07:50.905 --> 07:54.299
I do not want a repeat
of the Bullingdon club incident.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.867
Please take the gauntlet off
before someone sees you.

08:02.917 --> 08:05.223
It's stuck.

08:05.223 --> 08:07.312
What do you mean, it's stuck?
Give me that.

08:08.749 --> 08:12.448
Curse the tiny hands
of the 14th century chevaliers.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.538
Founders incoming. Be cool.

08:15.538 --> 08:17.540
- Dr. Finch.
- Oh.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.542
- Glad you could make it.
- Oh.

08:19.542 --> 08:20.891
Dr. Bowen, Dr. Sharma.

08:20.891 --> 08:22.632
It's so great to see you.

08:22.632 --> 08:24.460
These are my colleagues
Dr. Crane and Dr. Cornwall.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.244
- Yeah, lovely to see you.
Oh, thank you so much. Hi.
- Hello.

08:26.244 --> 08:27.898
Charmed.

08:29.378 --> 08:31.380
Dr. Finch, everyone

08:31.380 --> 08:33.513
is buzzing about how you're

08:33.513 --> 08:35.689
transforming
the psych department.

08:35.689 --> 08:38.387
Thank you, but Dr. Crane here
is the true game-changer.

08:38.387 --> 08:41.651
Oh, now, Dr. Cornwall
invented game-changing.

08:41.651 --> 08:44.306
Oh, please, game-changing
was game over

08:44.306 --> 08:46.787
until Dr. Finch changed
the game-changing game.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.266
Oh.

08:48.266 --> 08:51.226
You all sound like
real game-changers.

08:51.226 --> 08:53.445
I'm thinking the same thing.

08:53.445 --> 08:55.230
We could use that around here.

08:55.230 --> 08:57.275
Plus, it is refreshing
to see such a spirit

08:57.275 --> 08:58.668
of camaraderie.

08:58.668 --> 09:02.585
Not everyone here
is always that supportive.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.805
You should know how
to parallel park by now.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.415
We were on a hill.

09:08.460 --> 09:09.897
We killed it.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.855
Frasier, your alliance idea
was brilliant.

09:11.855 --> 09:14.597
I think this calls for a drink.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.468
You know, usually
I refrain from statements

09:16.468 --> 09:17.992
that might come back
to haunt me,

09:17.992 --> 09:20.734
but I believe that we are
going to get into this club,

09:20.734 --> 09:23.606
and nothing is going
to stop that from happening.

09:23.606 --> 09:26.391
Well, it is a great group
of candidates.

09:26.391 --> 09:27.479
It sure is.

09:27.479 --> 09:29.394
It's too bad we only have room

09:29.394 --> 09:32.136
for two new members this year.

09:40.928 --> 09:43.931
So, two spots

09:43.931 --> 09:46.760
and...

09:46.760 --> 09:48.588
three of us.

09:49.980 --> 09:53.636
Puts our alliance
in a precarious situation.

09:53.636 --> 09:56.900
What to do? What to do?

10:01.296 --> 10:04.516
You know, it's times like this
I like to remind myself,

10:04.516 --> 10:07.258
Dr. Crane, I hired you.

10:07.258 --> 10:09.609
Yes, but what's more important:

10:09.609 --> 10:11.654
a job that forces you to work

10:11.654 --> 10:14.614
a soul-crushing
eight hours a week,

10:14.614 --> 10:16.790
or a decades-long
friendship with a man

10:16.790 --> 10:19.531
whom you recently described
as ravishing?

10:20.881 --> 10:23.927
Or maybe
the strongest bond of all

10:23.927 --> 10:27.365
is between two people,
a man and a woman,

10:27.365 --> 10:28.976
whose faces have never been
on a billboard.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.760
All right, let's just stop it.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.675
Two of us can still get in

10:32.675 --> 10:34.938
if we maintain
our alliance. Please,

10:34.938 --> 10:37.680
just remember the inspiring
words of Cincinnatus

10:37.680 --> 10:39.290
as he addressed his troops,

10:39.290 --> 10:42.511
<i>"Oblivisci societatis.</i>

10:42.511 --> 10:46.602
<i>Pascamus eam lupis."</i>

10:48.343 --> 10:50.388
Yes.

10:50.388 --> 10:52.826
To which his crowd cheered,

10:52.826 --> 10:55.611
<i>"Sub curru laciamus eam."</i>

10:55.611 --> 10:58.353
Ah, exactly.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.572
And then Cincinnatus said,

11:00.572 --> 11:02.444
in the spirit of harmony,

11:02.444 --> 11:04.881
<i>"Ita callidi sumus,</i>

11:04.881 --> 11:08.842
<i>plane ea Latine nescit."</i>

11:12.976 --> 11:15.849
I'm so glad we're a team.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.943
- Ah, here comes
the happy couple.
- You let him do this?

11:22.943 --> 11:24.858
Well, in my defense,
I thought it would be funny.

11:24.858 --> 11:27.730
And, in my further defense,
it was.

11:27.730 --> 11:30.298
It's not that he asked me out.

11:30.298 --> 11:31.865
It's how he asked me out.

11:31.865 --> 11:34.824
What, this charmer? Come on,
couldn't have been that bad.

11:38.523 --> 11:39.699
How'd you ask her out?

11:41.831 --> 11:43.877
Stop. Stop.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.574
Wow.

11:45.574 --> 11:46.706
This is not my forte.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.317
I'm not suave like you are.

11:49.317 --> 11:50.927
You've kissed, what,

11:50.927 --> 11:53.277
four, five girls?

11:53.277 --> 11:56.890
Four... [sighs] David.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.543
I'm Mr. July

11:58.543 --> 12:01.633
in the firefighters' calendar.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.766
I'm a man in uniform
with a full head of hair.

12:03.766 --> 12:06.682
I-I carry women
out of burning buildings.

12:06.682 --> 12:09.772
You think they just want
to shake my hand after?

12:09.772 --> 12:11.382
Ooh, big talk
coming from the guy

12:11.382 --> 12:12.906
sitting at home reading...

12:12.906 --> 12:15.778
<i>Little Women.</i> What?

12:15.778 --> 12:18.912
I'd like to see you try coming
of age during the Civil War.

12:18.912 --> 12:21.915
Your cousin has no idea
how to talk to girls.

12:21.915 --> 12:24.613
It would be very nice
if you would help him.

12:24.613 --> 12:25.919
But...

12:29.966 --> 12:32.795
Okay, fine.

12:32.795 --> 12:34.928
David, tonight
I'm gonna teach you

12:34.928 --> 12:38.801
how to strike up conversation
with a real live human woman.

12:38.801 --> 12:40.281
That's right,

12:40.281 --> 12:43.632
I am gonna give you the gift

12:43.632 --> 12:46.287
of game.

12:46.287 --> 12:48.855
Loser. Okay, you know what?

12:48.855 --> 12:50.421
I'm gonna stay and help.

12:50.421 --> 12:52.815
Really? How many girls
have you kissed?

12:52.815 --> 12:55.470
More than you, babe.

12:56.688 --> 12:57.994
Oh.

12:57.994 --> 13:00.736
There he is, Dean Melvin.
Okay, um,

13:00.736 --> 13:02.520
I need to get some air
before I speak to him.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.348
- Do not start without me.
- No, of course.
- Of course, of course.

13:04.348 --> 13:06.611
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

13:08.265 --> 13:10.485
- What a pleasure to meet you.
- Oh,

13:10.485 --> 13:13.314
likewise. Sorry, I'm just
looking for a bottle opener.

13:13.314 --> 13:14.750
Oh, well, allow me.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.060
Thank you.

13:20.060 --> 13:23.237
Wow, wish you two
were around all the time.

13:23.237 --> 13:26.675
I think
that could be arranged.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.551
Dean Melvin, hello.

13:34.248 --> 13:35.989
<i>"Voluptatem, ut semper."</i>

13:35.989 --> 13:38.861
Oh, Dr. Finch. I'd forgotten
you're a fellow Latin buff.

13:38.861 --> 13:41.385
Not a very useful skill
these days, is it?

13:41.385 --> 13:43.257
Oh, you'd be surprised.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.782
Uh, where are your colleagues?

13:46.782 --> 13:49.393
I think they think that
schmoozing with the waiter

13:49.393 --> 13:51.482
is going to get them
into the club.

13:51.482 --> 13:53.528
You know, something
I'm wondering, actually, is,

13:53.528 --> 13:55.878
what is your take on Keynesian

13:55.878 --> 13:57.967
theory versus neoclassical?

13:57.967 --> 14:00.404
What's the difference?

14:01.275 --> 14:02.580
Fascinating.

14:05.192 --> 14:06.236
So, what you're saying is

14:06.236 --> 14:08.630
they're really different sides

14:08.630 --> 14:11.198
of the same coin.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.504
You're a trip, man.

14:15.245 --> 14:18.205
- Can I get you a drink?
- Oh, we should be
getting you a drink.

14:18.205 --> 14:19.554
Where's that damn waiter?

14:19.554 --> 14:21.730
I don't know. Where is he?

14:25.342 --> 14:27.823
- Almost ready.
- What's with the whistle?

14:27.823 --> 14:29.259
Well, at the fire station
we run drills

14:29.259 --> 14:30.391
till we get things right.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.045
Tonight you

14:32.045 --> 14:34.656
are gonna master walking up to
a woman and making small talk.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.397
Eve will be your practice girl.

14:36.397 --> 14:40.488
Can we not refer to me
as a practice girl?

14:40.488 --> 14:43.404
Okay, uh, please
approach your...

14:43.404 --> 14:44.753
rehearsal human...

14:45.319 --> 14:47.234
...and introduce yourself.

14:49.279 --> 14:50.367
Hello, milady.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.762
She's not Maid Marian. Go back,

14:53.762 --> 14:56.939
try again.
Speak like people your own age.

14:58.462 --> 14:59.550
Sup, queen?

15:00.769 --> 15:01.726
Nope. Do it again.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.772
This is really hard.

15:03.772 --> 15:06.949
Are you sure I have to talk
to someone to date them?

15:06.949 --> 15:09.778
Uh, let's just pretend
you're at a club.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.475
Talk about your surroundings.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.444
It's really loud in here!

15:24.706 --> 15:26.838
Yeah, that was my bad.

15:26.838 --> 15:29.406
Let's say it's a coffee shop.

15:29.406 --> 15:30.538
How loud is it?

15:30.538 --> 15:32.496
You're the only
two people there.

15:32.496 --> 15:33.976
Why? Does it have
a bad health score?

15:33.976 --> 15:36.848
- David.
- Sorry, sorry.

15:36.848 --> 15:39.373
Who's your favorite magician?

15:40.113 --> 15:42.506
So, you want to hear
some facts about whales?

15:43.812 --> 15:45.379
What's your favorite word?

15:45.379 --> 15:47.207
Mine's a tie between
"conquistador" and "lemon."

15:48.643 --> 15:50.427
I'm a gentleman,
so I'll ask first,

15:50.427 --> 15:51.776
may I smell your hair?

15:53.604 --> 15:55.476
Want to guess
how many toes I have?

15:55.476 --> 15:56.956
Hint, it's lower.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.702
Why am I so bad at this
when my father

16:04.702 --> 16:06.704
was such a ladies' man?

16:06.704 --> 16:09.925
You're making this way too hard.
Keep it simple.

16:09.925 --> 16:12.493
Confidence is attractive.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.538
Stand straight.
Freddy, show him.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.543
Then just try
to make eye contact. Freddy?

16:22.546 --> 16:24.461
If she looks away,
she's not feeling it,

16:24.461 --> 16:27.247
but if she looks back,
she might be.

16:29.553 --> 16:33.253
Then just to make conversation.
Freddy?

16:33.253 --> 16:35.385
Hey, I noticed

16:35.385 --> 16:37.387
the book you were reading.
Any good?

16:37.387 --> 16:39.824
Yeah, it's so good.

16:39.824 --> 16:41.826
- I actually already finished it.
- Oh.

16:41.826 --> 16:44.699
- Do you want to borrow it?
- I'd love to,

16:44.699 --> 16:48.268
but then I'd need
to get your number.

16:48.268 --> 16:50.879
You know, so I can return it.

16:50.879 --> 16:53.403
Sure.

16:53.403 --> 16:55.579
I hope you're a fast reader.

16:57.886 --> 16:59.453
Wow.

17:00.628 --> 17:02.630
I'm really bad
at reading people,

17:02.630 --> 17:04.632
but I could've sworn
you two were into each other.

17:06.242 --> 17:08.549
Great acting. Even you, Eve.

17:12.770 --> 17:14.729
<i>So you play quite
an important role here?</i>

17:14.729 --> 17:17.297
I'm just here to serve people.

17:17.297 --> 17:20.822
Such a noble way
of looking at it.

17:20.822 --> 17:24.130
That's what I keep trying
to tell my mom.

17:24.869 --> 17:27.785
Well, she's a fool
if she's not proud.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.614
You guys get me.

17:31.354 --> 17:34.401
Listen, I should probably
go out and make the rounds.

17:34.401 --> 17:37.491
Yes, of course. We just wanted
some face time with the dean.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.754
Who's Dean?

17:39.754 --> 17:42.191
Well, you are.
Dean Melvin.

17:42.191 --> 17:45.281
I'm Kevin.
That guy's Dean Melvin.

17:53.594 --> 17:54.943
What are you doing?

17:54.943 --> 17:57.380
I'm attempting
to flip her the bird.

17:57.380 --> 17:58.947
Hey, listen,

17:58.947 --> 18:01.602
if you guys want
to get high later,

18:01.602 --> 18:03.473
just let me know.

18:08.652 --> 18:10.611
I'm in.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.874
Dean Melvin loved me
and said that he will make sure

18:12.874 --> 18:16.269
that I am accepted,
but, more importantly,

18:16.269 --> 18:18.662
<i>"Servus te amavit?"</i>

18:18.662 --> 18:20.751
Well, he asked us to get high,

18:20.751 --> 18:23.145
so I think he liked us
pretty well.

18:24.799 --> 18:27.628
Well, good news for you is that

18:27.628 --> 18:29.412
Dean Melvin is interested
in my recommendation

18:29.412 --> 18:30.979
for the final spot.

18:30.979 --> 18:33.982
And, for the record, I am
very open to accepting bribes.

18:33.982 --> 18:37.377
Oh, please, Olivia,
our friendship is rock solid.

18:37.377 --> 18:39.379
We're not about to start
competing with each other...

18:39.379 --> 18:40.467
I'll give you my son.

18:40.467 --> 18:41.859
What?

18:42.643 --> 18:45.689
Don't play so coy, sister. I've
seen the way you look at him.

18:46.603 --> 18:48.518
I know when he showers.
I can get you...

18:48.518 --> 18:49.911
What the hell am I doing?

18:49.911 --> 18:52.783
What you're doing
is making a deal. Keep talking.

18:52.783 --> 18:55.830
I know I've said no
a hundred times, Olivia,

18:55.830 --> 18:58.311
but now I am prepared...

18:58.311 --> 19:00.530
to go ice-skating with you.

19:00.530 --> 19:03.490
Alan, do not mess with me.

19:03.490 --> 19:04.882
Oh, come on, it's obvious

19:04.882 --> 19:06.319
who's Founders' Society
material around here.

19:06.319 --> 19:07.755
it's the one of us

19:07.755 --> 19:10.192
who doesn't need a can opener
to check his watch.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.628
So we're just

19:11.628 --> 19:14.457
trading jabs now, are we? Fine.

19:14.457 --> 19:18.374
Then it is time
to throw down the gauntlet.

19:19.854 --> 19:22.683
- Oh, that would've been so good.
- Hmm.

19:22.683 --> 19:24.859
Decide between yourselves
and then let me know.

19:24.859 --> 19:26.469
Right now Alan is ahead.

19:26.469 --> 19:28.602
Text Monica.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.343
"I finally found
a skating partner."

19:30.343 --> 19:32.432
"I finally found
a mating partner."

19:32.432 --> 19:34.521
That is much better.

19:34.521 --> 19:36.523
All right.

19:36.523 --> 19:38.220
I think I've come up
with a solution

19:38.220 --> 19:39.352
that'll make us both happy.

19:39.352 --> 19:40.483
Go on.

19:40.483 --> 19:42.268
You bow out.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.357
What? Why should I bow out?

19:44.357 --> 19:46.707
Because this is important to me,
and as far as I can tell,

19:46.707 --> 19:48.230
nothing is important to you.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.753
Plus, you owe me.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.973
I owe you? What the hell
does that mean?

19:51.973 --> 19:53.757
You know perfectly well
what it means.

19:53.757 --> 19:56.499
Explain it to me
like I'm a student at Tufts.

19:59.415 --> 20:00.547
You...

20:00.547 --> 20:03.245
are the one...

20:03.245 --> 20:06.901
who wanted to steal
Oscar Wilde's cane.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.511
You...

20:08.511 --> 20:11.906
are the one who wanted to play
with that poodle.

20:13.516 --> 20:17.259
You take nothing seriously,

20:17.259 --> 20:20.741
and I am always the one
who has to pay a price for it.

20:20.741 --> 20:23.961
You make me sound
like some reckless buffoon.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.713
Anyway, this place
isn't that great, you know.

20:36.713 --> 20:39.673
A huge crack in that table.

20:45.461 --> 20:48.290
Will you please, please

20:48.290 --> 20:51.685
not ruin this one thing for me?

20:53.339 --> 20:54.731
I see.

20:55.689 --> 20:58.039
I had no idea
this is how you felt about us,

20:58.039 --> 20:59.301
and I'm very sorry.

20:59.301 --> 21:00.824
I will of course

21:00.824 --> 21:03.262
bow out, and I'll help you
secure that final spot.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.915
Thank you. Now,

21:04.915 --> 21:07.440
let's go talk me up
to some of the other members.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.702
We're almost out of time.

21:08.702 --> 21:11.966
Uh, if I may, uh,
one tiny request first.

21:11.966 --> 21:15.317
I'd like you to help me meet
a rather special lady.

21:15.317 --> 21:19.539
Really? Who is the intoxicating
little creature, eh?

21:21.802 --> 21:23.847
She's beautiful, isn't she?

21:23.847 --> 21:26.633
Gorgeous. Now, can we go?

21:26.633 --> 21:28.678
You act like you've never seen
a bottle of alcohol before.

21:31.507 --> 21:35.381
It's a vintage
Chateau Chien Blanc.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.818
Oh, I'll give you two
some privacy.

21:37.818 --> 21:41.430
I noticed something on the way
in. I just want to check it.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.998
Ah, Lady Chien.

21:43.998 --> 21:46.957
Well, I don't mean to brag,
but I was right.

21:46.957 --> 21:49.003
- About?
- Well, on our way in here,

21:49.003 --> 21:53.312
I accidentally locked the door,
and we're stuck down here.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.748
What?

21:54.748 --> 21:57.577
Yeah, I know, I know,
we're both upset.

21:57.577 --> 21:59.013
If only there were

21:59.013 --> 22:01.842
something in this room
that could help

22:01.842 --> 22:04.453
calm our nerves.

22:07.543 --> 22:09.502
All right, David,
this is the final drill.

22:09.502 --> 22:11.286
Releasing you into the wild.

22:11.286 --> 22:12.983
Remember, the goal
is just to meet someone

22:12.983 --> 22:16.596
and have a conversation.
You see anyone interesting?

22:17.248 --> 22:18.946
I don't know if I can do this.

22:18.946 --> 22:20.687
I forgot how people talk.

22:20.687 --> 22:23.690
Maybe I could just build
a girlfriend. That seems easier.

22:23.690 --> 22:25.692
I don't disagree, but, uh,

22:25.692 --> 22:27.389
I think you should
give it a try.

22:27.389 --> 22:28.695
I need a drink.

22:28.695 --> 22:32.481
He's joking about building
a girlfriend, right?

22:32.481 --> 22:35.266
I don't know.
I've seen the schematics.

22:35.266 --> 22:38.835
Tonic soda, grenadine back,
don't skimp on the ice.

22:39.793 --> 22:41.664
Sorry.

22:41.664 --> 22:45.233
Just taking the edge off.
I'm... I'm really nervous.

22:46.539 --> 22:48.671
Oh, I get it.

22:49.672 --> 22:50.804
I'm the same way.

22:50.804 --> 22:52.545
Uh, sometimes, when I'm nervous,

22:52.545 --> 22:55.635
I close my eyes
and recite state capitals.

22:55.635 --> 22:57.419
I do the same thing
with presidents.

22:57.419 --> 22:59.552
Yes. We can both say Lincoln.

23:01.597 --> 23:04.208
Uh, you know what
really calms me down?

23:04.208 --> 23:05.558
Sniffing old books?

23:05.558 --> 23:08.648
Get out of my head.

23:08.648 --> 23:11.302
Th-There's an old bookstore
around the corner,

23:11.302 --> 23:12.434
if you want to go check it out.

23:12.434 --> 23:14.610
I'd love to.

23:17.613 --> 23:18.919
Sorry, guys.

23:18.919 --> 23:21.748
I-I don't think
it's gonna work out tonight.

23:21.748 --> 23:24.228
I'll do better next time,
I promise.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.407
Milady.

23:33.455 --> 23:36.545
Did he just pick up a girl
without even realizing it?

23:36.545 --> 23:40.244
You know, now and then,
in this workaday world,

23:40.244 --> 23:43.378
things do happen in a delightful

23:43.378 --> 23:45.467
storybook fashion,

23:45.467 --> 23:47.426
and what a comfort it is.

23:48.601 --> 23:49.776
Is that a quote
from <i>Little Women?</i>

23:49.776 --> 23:51.255
It's a classic for a reason.

23:54.345 --> 23:55.782
No signal down here, of course.

23:55.782 --> 23:58.785
So, the Founders' Society
mixer is almost over,

23:58.785 --> 24:01.614
the only people we've mixed with
are each other and Kevin.

24:01.614 --> 24:04.791
And, again, I'm sorry.
I promise you, in future,

24:04.791 --> 24:08.577
I won't pull you into any more
of my silly antics.

24:08.577 --> 24:11.406
Now, just put your hands
like this.

24:11.406 --> 24:12.755
Thank you.

24:14.365 --> 24:15.541
Alan.

24:18.544 --> 24:20.546
Well, we're gonna be
down here awhile.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.852
We might as well have something
warm in our bellies.

24:24.724 --> 24:26.203
Oh, yes.

24:26.203 --> 24:29.206
This is a big joke. Does
anything actually matter to you?

24:29.206 --> 24:32.819
I can think of two things
I care deeply about:

24:32.819 --> 24:35.778
my cat and you.

24:37.737 --> 24:40.522
I was sure you were
going to say Scotch.

24:42.568 --> 24:45.353
I know I can be flippant
about things, and that

24:45.353 --> 24:48.530
you've had to
pay the price, so...

24:48.530 --> 24:50.880
I'm sorry if I've
mucked things up again.

24:52.316 --> 24:54.362
Thank you.

24:54.362 --> 24:56.625
And I'm sorry if I seem to take

24:56.625 --> 24:58.627
things a bit too seriously sometimes.

24:58.627 --> 25:00.934
I've always wondered
why that is.

25:02.457 --> 25:04.328
You know, it's funny.

25:06.461 --> 25:08.507
The thing about me is, I...

25:08.507 --> 25:12.206
I've always wanted to fit in
somewhere, you know?

25:12.206 --> 25:13.860
I mean, even when I was

25:13.860 --> 25:17.298
back in Boston, I-I used to be
a regular at a bar, and yet...

25:17.298 --> 25:20.388
Nobody knew your name?

25:21.824 --> 25:25.436
Well, not-not exactly,
but, um...

25:26.525 --> 25:28.570
I still have this longing

25:28.570 --> 25:30.354
to find the place
where I belong.

25:30.354 --> 25:33.619
Ugh, have you still got passion?

25:34.924 --> 25:36.578
We're in our 60s, man.

25:36.578 --> 25:39.407
What's wrong with "good enough"?
What's wrong with "this'll do"?

25:39.407 --> 25:41.627
What's wrong with

25:41.627 --> 25:44.368
limping towards the finish line?

25:46.936 --> 25:49.243
What's wrong? Well, let's see.

25:49.243 --> 25:51.637
We're locked in a basement,

25:51.637 --> 25:54.248
uh, you've got a, a gauntlet

25:54.248 --> 25:56.380
stuck on your arm.

25:56.380 --> 25:58.426
And you're drinking
century-old booze

25:58.426 --> 26:00.602
with your best-looking friend.

26:01.516 --> 26:03.518
Sounds delightful.

26:03.518 --> 26:06.303
The only thing I would change...

26:06.303 --> 26:08.697
is that terrible Scotch.

26:09.959 --> 26:12.353
Why am I chewing?

26:15.661 --> 26:18.489
Well, if nothing else,
consider this,

26:18.489 --> 26:21.623
we've got the sixth story
to bore everyone with.

26:21.623 --> 26:24.713
That's a hell
of a silver lining.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.846
You know,
I don't remember

26:26.846 --> 26:29.457
one thing about
that Bullingdon Club,

26:29.457 --> 26:32.199
but I'll never forget
being tackled by those

26:32.199 --> 26:34.854
rabid librarian bullies.

26:34.854 --> 26:36.464
Gosh.

26:36.464 --> 26:39.554
That is something
I will always remember.

26:39.554 --> 26:41.164
Me, too.

26:41.164 --> 26:44.690
So you're no longer mad at me
for messing up your evening?

26:44.690 --> 26:46.474
No, of course not.

26:46.474 --> 26:49.695
Good, because I lied
about the door being locked.

26:49.695 --> 26:52.219
What? You mean
the door's been unlocked

26:52.219 --> 26:55.309
- all this time?
- No, no, have a look.
There isn't a door.

26:58.704 --> 27:02.185
What? You locked me in a room
without a door?

27:03.012 --> 27:05.711
Not bad for a reckless buffoon.

27:07.408 --> 27:09.671
No, I just thought we ought to,
uh, hash things out.

27:11.455 --> 27:13.153
I've certainly
learned my lesson.

27:13.153 --> 27:16.243
Who cares
about this ridiculous club?

27:16.243 --> 27:19.420
I've got you. I don't need them.

27:20.464 --> 27:23.816
Dr. Crane. I've been dying
to speak with you all night.

27:23.816 --> 27:27.428
We would be honored if you
would like to join our society.

27:42.225 --> 27:43.705
I'd love to.

27:43.705 --> 27:46.229
Wonderful.

27:50.756 --> 27:55.499
The fact that you paused at all
is a huge step forward.

28:03.725 --> 28:06.206
