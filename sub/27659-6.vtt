WEBVTT

00:06.093 --> 00:08.356
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.

00:08.399 --> 00:10.097
The coffee guy was--
- Assaulting your head?

00:10.140 --> 00:11.968
What is going on up there?
- Is it bad?

00:12.012 --> 00:13.709
- Before I answer
that question,

00:13.752 --> 00:15.189
do you currently have
a knife on you?

00:15.232 --> 00:16.581
- Yeah, several.
- Then I love it.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.322
It really... is hair.
It's bad, Rosa.

00:18.366 --> 00:20.020
You look like Edna
from "The Incredibles."

00:20.063 --> 00:21.499
I'm sorry, don't stab me.

00:21.543 --> 00:23.153
- My girlfriend Jocelyn's
been practicing

00:23.197 --> 00:24.720
a bunch of different hairstyles
on me.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.156
She's in cosmetology school.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.245
- Is she... passing?
- Honestly, I don't know.

00:28.289 --> 00:29.725
- Well, let's get into
this murder.

00:29.768 --> 00:32.336
I'm hoping it's a dope one.

00:32.380 --> 00:35.861
Mamma mia.
That's a bloody pizza pie.

00:35.905 --> 00:37.037
- No, it's okay.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.299
I can say that.
I'm half Italian.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.301
- That's not the problem
I had with it.

00:40.344 --> 00:42.346
- Detectives. The vacuum
was running when we got here.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.000
Smeared blood
across the entire apartment.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.175
- Is this dope enough for you?

00:45.219 --> 00:46.524
- I mean,
it's a bloody robot, Rosa.

00:46.568 --> 00:48.048
It's clearly a good start,
but it's gonna take

00:48.091 --> 00:49.397
more than that
to be certified as dope.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.007
Who's the vic?
- Name is Andrew Adams.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.269
- Kind of a boring name.
Not dope.

00:52.313 --> 00:53.575
- He's an investigative
reporter.

00:53.618 --> 00:55.055
- Dope.
What was he investigating?

00:55.098 --> 00:56.360
- Chicken farming.

00:56.404 --> 00:57.666
- Sharp turn away
from dopeness,

00:57.709 --> 00:59.276
but who found the body?

00:59.320 --> 01:01.235
- His boss called the cops
when he didn't show up to work,

01:01.278 --> 01:02.627
so he was found
by Officer Darrell.

01:02.671 --> 01:04.499
- Officer Darrell? You are
seriously undoping this.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.283
You got anything else
for me? Jen?

01:06.327 --> 01:08.285
- The apartment was locked
from the inside.

01:08.329 --> 01:09.721
- Mysterious. Dope.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.245
- And the alarm system
was still armed.

01:11.288 --> 01:12.681
- Dope, dope, dope, dope.
So hard to solve.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.552
- Any surveillance cameras?
- Oh, yeah.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.076
Tons of 'em. We checked 'em.
- It's too easy.

01:16.119 --> 01:17.425
- But no one was seen
going in or out.

01:17.468 --> 01:18.948
So whoever did this
was a ghost.

01:18.991 --> 01:20.210
- Yes! A ghost!

01:20.254 --> 01:24.171
Oh! I officially declare
this case... dope!

01:44.060 --> 01:47.585
Whoo! I love the first
walkthrough of a crime scene.

01:47.629 --> 01:49.239
It's kind of like arriving
at summer camp,

01:49.283 --> 01:50.806
except the lake
is full of blood

01:50.849 --> 01:52.155
and your bunk mate is dead.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.852
I think I might be bad
at metaphors.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.724
- So after Adams comes home
from work,

01:55.767 --> 01:57.204
the only person
who even approaches

01:57.247 --> 01:58.640
his doorway
is this delivery guy?

01:58.683 --> 02:00.250
- Yeah, but he never enters
the apartment.

02:00.294 --> 02:02.034
- Hey, Rosa. Check it out.
Triple digies!

02:02.078 --> 02:04.428
There's so much evidence,
we hit triple digies.

02:04.472 --> 02:06.256
- Cool.
- Cool indeed.

02:06.300 --> 02:07.692
But you know what's not cool?

02:07.736 --> 02:09.520
Our vic ordered his dinner
from House of Lettuce.

02:09.564 --> 02:11.609
There's no way this guy knew
he was gonna die.

02:11.653 --> 02:13.785
No one would want lettuce
as their last meal.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.787
For example, my last meal...

02:15.831 --> 02:17.789
is gon'st to be Sour Straws.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.139
- You just keep those
in your pocket?

02:19.182 --> 02:20.444
- We face death every day.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.229
I gotta be prepared to go out
on my own terms.

02:22.272 --> 02:23.578
- I can't even think
about eating.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.580
Smells like the brim
of Scully's hat in here.

02:25.623 --> 02:28.191
- That's the heat wave.
It sped up body decomp.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.150
I guess you could say
this mystery

02:30.193 --> 02:31.803
is straight outta decomp...

02:31.847 --> 02:32.804
...ton.

02:32.848 --> 02:35.024
- No. Who are you?

02:35.067 --> 02:36.156
- I'm Franco McCoy.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.374
I'm running CSI and forensics.

02:37.418 --> 02:38.984
You two must be detectives.

02:39.028 --> 02:40.508
I can tell because you look
pretty buttoned up.

02:40.551 --> 02:42.205
- We're both wearing
leather jackets.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.424
And I won this hoodie
for eating a big pizza.

02:43.467 --> 02:44.903
- Just do me a favor.

02:44.947 --> 02:46.775
Don't turn into a star humper
around me or my squad,

02:46.818 --> 02:48.559
because they make TV shows
about us sometimes.

02:48.603 --> 02:50.213
- What? They make shows
about us all the time.

02:50.257 --> 02:51.823
- Name one.
- "Law and Order."

02:51.867 --> 02:53.173
- Never heard of it.
- "NYPD Blue."

02:53.216 --> 02:54.304
- Nope.
- "Miami Vice."

02:54.348 --> 02:55.436
- Nah.
- "Hill Street Blues."

02:55.479 --> 02:56.741
- Pass.
- "The Wire."

02:56.785 --> 02:57.960
- Sounds dumb.
- "Rizzoli & Isles."

02:58.003 --> 02:59.353
- Okay. That's a good one.

02:59.396 --> 03:00.832
- All right, if the heat
is causing the smell,

03:00.876 --> 03:02.312
why don't we just turn on
the air conditioning--

03:02.356 --> 03:03.661
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That kind of air flow

03:03.705 --> 03:05.272
is gonna kick up
all kinds of dust particles.

03:05.315 --> 03:06.664
That AC stays off,
which means the odor in here?

03:06.708 --> 03:08.362
Only gonna get worse.
Pro tip: plug your noses.

03:08.405 --> 03:10.277
Had this little bad boy
custom-made 3-D printed

03:10.320 --> 03:12.192
to fit these sweet nosters.

03:12.235 --> 03:14.106
- Are you trying
to abbreviate "nostrils"?

03:14.150 --> 03:16.283
- In CSI, we don't try.

03:17.980 --> 03:19.503
We do, son.

03:19.547 --> 03:22.724
- Okay. Well, it's been
sort of okay meeting you.

03:22.767 --> 03:24.726
We're gonna turn our backs
and ignore you now.

03:26.858 --> 03:28.599
- Hey, Jake.
You know what it's time for?

03:28.643 --> 03:29.818
- I sure do.

03:29.861 --> 03:31.602
both: Jake and Rosa's
first impressions.

03:31.646 --> 03:33.213
- Cast-off pattern
on the far wall

03:33.256 --> 03:34.518
suggests upward
knife slices. Jake?

03:34.562 --> 03:35.737
- Wounds on the vic's back
means

03:35.780 --> 03:37.347
he didn't see
the killer coming. Rosa?

03:37.391 --> 03:38.914
- Laptop, wallet, keys
all in plain sight.

03:38.957 --> 03:40.132
No sign of forced entry.

03:40.176 --> 03:41.351
Doesn't connote
a robbery. Jake?

03:41.395 --> 03:42.657
- But it does connote
that our killer

03:42.700 --> 03:44.224
was waiting for Adams
in the apartment.

03:44.267 --> 03:45.312
Did I just use the word
"connote" correctly?

03:45.355 --> 03:46.313
- You did.
- Great.

03:46.356 --> 03:47.836
Will you text that to Amy?

03:47.879 --> 03:49.316
I don't want to say what using
good vocabulary gets me.

03:49.359 --> 03:50.491
- Okay.
- Sexual intercourse.

03:50.534 --> 03:51.883
- Gross.
- What? We're adults.

03:51.927 --> 03:54.059
- I'm his mother!
Let me in!

03:54.103 --> 03:55.365
- Rock-paper-scissors

03:55.409 --> 03:57.062
for who has to talk
to the vic's mom.

03:57.106 --> 03:58.673
- Deal.

03:58.716 --> 04:00.022
It's a game of chance.
How do you always win?

04:00.065 --> 04:01.502
- You always pick paper.

04:01.545 --> 04:03.852
- That is not true.
Here, go again.

04:03.895 --> 04:04.940
One more time.

04:04.983 --> 04:07.203
All right, one more time.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.726
One more time.
One more time.

04:08.770 --> 04:11.251
One more time.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.774
All right, one more time.

04:12.817 --> 04:14.254
One more time.

04:14.297 --> 04:16.430
God, this reverse psychology
is a bust!

04:16.473 --> 04:18.301
Ma'am? I'm Detective Peralta.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.260
This is Detective Diaz.

04:20.303 --> 04:21.565
I'm so sorry for your loss.

04:21.609 --> 04:23.088
- Please tell me
whatever you can.

04:23.132 --> 04:24.394
Nobody will tell me anything.

04:24.438 --> 04:25.700
- I really wish that I could,

04:25.743 --> 04:27.223
but we're just starting
our investigation.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.181
Now, is there anyone
you can think of

04:29.225 --> 04:30.618
that would want to hurt
your son?

04:30.661 --> 04:32.272
- No! Everybody loved Andrew.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.534
I don't know why this happened!

04:33.577 --> 04:35.275
Please, you have to find
who did this.

04:35.318 --> 04:36.711
- We're doing everything
we can.

04:36.754 --> 04:38.843
- Promise me
you'll find who did this.

04:38.887 --> 04:41.455
- Ma'am, we can't promise--
- Promise me!

04:41.498 --> 04:43.370
Andrew was my whole world.

04:43.413 --> 04:45.372
I'm a single mom.

04:46.634 --> 04:49.332
- I promise you.
- Wow.

04:49.376 --> 04:50.768
You really are an idiot.

04:50.812 --> 04:51.769
- Um, exsqueeze me?

04:51.813 --> 04:53.423
- Did you really just promise

04:53.467 --> 04:54.859
a victim's family member
we would solve a crime?

04:54.903 --> 04:57.122
- Oh, come on.
I was just consoling her.

04:57.166 --> 04:59.603
- No. It was a full-on promise,
and it wasn't just her.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.170
- Yes, Betty.

05:01.213 --> 05:02.824
I promise I will find
your friend's son's killer.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.434
Yes, you can put
your husband on.

05:04.478 --> 05:05.957
I'll promise him too.

05:06.001 --> 05:07.611
Okay, well, what's his number
at work, then?

05:07.655 --> 05:09.134
Do you have a pen?

05:09.178 --> 05:10.527
- You broke the number one rule

05:10.571 --> 05:12.442
of dealing with
a victim's family member.

05:12.486 --> 05:13.661
What were you thinking?
- I don't know.

05:13.704 --> 05:15.489
She reminded me
of my mom, okay?

05:15.532 --> 05:16.968
A single mother
crying in the hallway?

05:17.012 --> 05:18.709
Those are some of my best
childhood memories.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.015
- Jake.
- What, is that bad?

05:20.058 --> 05:21.364
- Dude, you never
make a promise,

05:21.408 --> 05:22.844
because if we don't solve this,

05:22.887 --> 05:24.498
you've given her false hope,
and that is way worse.

05:24.541 --> 05:25.716
- Normally, I would totally
agree with you,

05:25.760 --> 05:27.544
but we're going to solve
this case.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.590
We have so much evidence.
We hit triple digies!

05:29.633 --> 05:32.157
We'll interview his friends
and neighbors and coworkers.

05:32.201 --> 05:33.811
Come on.
We got this!

05:33.855 --> 05:35.335
We're Jake and Rosa!
- And also Franco.

05:35.378 --> 05:36.684
- You're not a part
of this, Franco.

05:36.727 --> 05:37.467
- Your loss.

05:40.165 --> 05:41.602
- My goodness.

05:41.645 --> 05:43.386
Did Mother Gothel finally
let you out of the tower

05:43.430 --> 05:44.996
to see the lanterns that fly
for your birthday?

05:45.040 --> 05:46.781
- What?
- It was a "Tangled" burn.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.391
Charles and I watched it
for bros night.

05:48.435 --> 05:49.479
- Cool. No, Jocelyn's learning

05:49.523 --> 05:50.654
how to weave in
hair extensions.

05:50.698 --> 05:51.916
She wanted me to look nice

05:51.960 --> 05:53.701
'cause I'm meeting
her parents tonight.

05:53.744 --> 05:56.225
- Wow. Moving fast.
Meetin' each other's parents.

05:56.268 --> 05:58.009
- Yeah. Well, I'm meeting hers.

05:58.053 --> 05:59.707
I still haven't talked
to my mom since coming out,

05:59.750 --> 06:02.318
so... it's kind of a bummer.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.493
I don't really want to talk
about this.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.016
Can we find a segue?

06:05.060 --> 06:06.670
- What? You can't just say
"let's find a segue."

06:06.714 --> 06:08.106
- I just did.
- Okay.

06:08.150 --> 06:09.543
- I talked to the neighbors.

06:09.586 --> 06:10.805
Our vic had a party
three nights before the murder.

06:10.848 --> 06:12.284
I talked to everyone
on the guest list.

06:12.328 --> 06:13.285
They all have alibis,
so I got nothing.

06:13.329 --> 06:14.678
How did your interviews go?

06:14.722 --> 06:15.853
- Not great. I talked
to his coworkers,

06:15.897 --> 06:17.028
friends, and family.

06:17.072 --> 06:18.203
No one had a motive.
Everyone loved him.

06:18.247 --> 06:20.031
The dumb jerk. RIP.

06:20.075 --> 06:21.468
- Did you promise any of them
that you'd find the killer?

06:21.511 --> 06:23.339
Yes, his aunt.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.601
She also reminded me of my mom.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.081
Her name was Karen!

06:26.124 --> 06:27.735
- Jake!
- Look, it's gonna be fine.

06:27.778 --> 06:29.214
This apartment is full
of forensic evidence.

06:29.258 --> 06:31.042
There is no way that CSI
hasn't found something.

06:31.086 --> 06:32.914
I have never been more
confident in my entire--

06:32.957 --> 06:34.524
I can taste
the smell.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.526
Ugh. You shouldn't be able
to taste smells.

06:36.570 --> 06:37.875
- That's the heat
cookin' the blood rot

06:37.919 --> 06:39.573
right out of the floorboards.

06:39.616 --> 06:42.227
Set scent to simmer.

06:42.271 --> 06:43.446
Serve over rice.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.274
- Well... I hated that.

06:45.317 --> 06:46.841
- Just so you know, Franco,

06:46.884 --> 06:48.451
we're not responding positively
to you as a person.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.235
- Yeah. Maybe just give us
an update on the labs.

06:50.279 --> 06:52.063
- Copy that. The victim
was stabbed 30 times.

06:52.107 --> 06:54.414
Coroner puts time of death
between 6:00 p.m.

06:54.457 --> 06:56.067
and 7:30 p.m. Sunday night.

06:56.111 --> 06:57.460
- Okay, and how many
DNA matches did you find?

06:57.504 --> 06:58.635
- None.
- What about hair?

06:58.679 --> 07:00.071
- Zero.
- Fingerprints?

07:00.115 --> 07:01.899
- Zilcharoni. I have
no matches of anything

07:01.943 --> 07:03.901
on any criminal databases
whatsoever.

07:03.945 --> 07:05.555
- Still feeling good
about your promise, Jake?

07:05.599 --> 07:07.470
- Still feeling good
about that haircut, Cousin It?

07:07.514 --> 07:09.429
Franco, how did you guys
not find anything?

07:09.472 --> 07:10.821
You had 15 people in here.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.083
First of all,

07:12.127 --> 07:13.302
you sound so ignorant
right now.

07:13.345 --> 07:14.651
I had 14 guys here.

07:14.695 --> 07:15.913
Like I'd ever get approval
for 15 guys.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.262
That's insane.

07:17.306 --> 07:18.873
Second of all, don't worry,
Detective Kitty Cat.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.614
I got one droplet of milk
nestled at the top

07:20.657 --> 07:22.224
of CSI's teat, so pucker up.

07:22.267 --> 07:23.747
- Just talk normal.

07:23.791 --> 07:26.533
- We tested the blood.

07:26.576 --> 07:29.274
This splatter here
belongs to the victim,

07:29.318 --> 07:30.711
this to a second individual,

07:30.754 --> 07:32.452
and that to a third.

07:32.495 --> 07:33.627
- Oh, hells, yes.

07:33.670 --> 07:34.845
We might have some perp blood
in here.

07:34.889 --> 07:35.890
This is huge!

07:35.933 --> 07:37.935
Rosa, we are gonna solve
this case.

07:37.979 --> 07:39.589
- What're you doing?
- Texting my mom.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.025
I mean, the vic's mom.

07:41.069 --> 07:42.505
I know that it's bad
that I said "my mom."

07:42.549 --> 07:43.985
- It's bad
that you're texting her.

07:44.028 --> 07:45.900
- I know!

07:50.295 --> 07:52.384
- Ah. Good morning, Rosa.

07:52.428 --> 07:53.734
I see you're still going out
with Edward Scissorhands.

07:53.777 --> 07:55.431
- You seem particularly chipper
this morning.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.259
- Indeed I am,
because I finally tracked down

07:57.302 --> 07:58.739
the guy who delivered our vic
his final meal

07:58.782 --> 08:00.262
and, in so doing,
maybe saw the other two guys

08:00.305 --> 08:01.872
who bled all over
this apartment.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.395
- We don't know there were
three people in this apartment.

08:03.439 --> 08:05.485
- Peralta. Diaz.
Special delivery.

08:05.528 --> 08:06.660
Delivery guy.

08:06.703 --> 08:08.313
- Wow, Franco,
you're really getting lazy.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.359
- You're lazy.
- Even lazier.

08:10.402 --> 08:12.274
Hello, sir. We'd like to ask
you a couple of questions.

08:12.317 --> 08:13.580
- Okay, look, I ate
a couple fries out of the bag,

08:13.623 --> 08:15.103
but everybody does that.

08:15.146 --> 08:16.844
- That's not why you're here.
- Oh, snap.

08:16.887 --> 08:18.019
Is this about weed?

08:18.062 --> 08:19.803
- Should it be?
- No?

08:19.847 --> 08:21.501
- You delivered food to the guy
in this apartment at 6:40 p.m.

08:21.544 --> 08:23.764
on Sunday, and within the hour,
he was murdered.

08:23.807 --> 08:25.592
- What? How?
That's horrible!

08:25.635 --> 08:27.115
- Don't worry.

08:27.158 --> 08:29.030
We're definitely gonna catch
the guy who did it, I promise.

08:29.073 --> 08:30.335
- Stop promising people.
- Not.

08:30.379 --> 08:31.815
- Did you see anything
suspicious?

08:31.859 --> 08:33.295
- No. But I didn't go inside.

08:33.338 --> 08:34.905
The guy came to the door.
I just gave him the food.

08:34.949 --> 08:36.777
- And did you see or hear
anyone else in the apartment?

08:36.820 --> 08:38.213
- No, just that one guy.

08:38.256 --> 08:41.042
He ordered, uh, three
beetroot zucchini wraps.

08:41.085 --> 08:42.347
- Three.
Three disgusting wraps.

08:42.391 --> 08:43.523
Three disgusting bloodstains.
I knew it.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.263
There were three people
in there.

08:45.307 --> 08:46.569
- Will you be willing
to go inside and let us know

08:46.613 --> 08:48.528
if anything looks different
to you?

08:48.571 --> 08:50.355
- Yeah. Sure, that's fine.
I don't care.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.444
Why would you
show this to me?

08:52.488 --> 08:55.186
Oh, I'm too high to see this.
There's blood on the fish!

08:55.230 --> 08:56.666
On the fish!

08:56.710 --> 08:58.407
-  I always forget
how weirdly numb

08:58.450 --> 09:00.191
to horrific things we are.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.584
Do you think it affects
our souls

09:01.628 --> 09:03.064
and the relationships
we build with others?

09:03.107 --> 09:04.413
- Oh, for sure.
- Oh.

09:04.456 --> 09:05.545
- You must have seen something.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.372
You delivered the food at 6:40,

09:07.416 --> 09:09.026
and sometime before 7:30,
Adams was stabbed to death.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.462
- Stop saying "stabbed"!

09:10.506 --> 09:11.551
What I saw in there
forever changed me.

09:11.594 --> 09:13.074
My heart is still pounding.

09:13.117 --> 09:14.379
- Wait.

09:14.423 --> 09:15.859
Adams was wearing
a smart watch, right?

09:15.903 --> 09:17.034
Those things track
your heart rate.

09:17.078 --> 09:18.470
If we look at his phone,
we can see

09:18.514 --> 09:20.951
the exact moment that his heart
stopped beating.

09:20.995 --> 09:23.737
Here we go. Activities app.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.129
And... boom.

09:25.173 --> 09:26.696
His heart rate dropped to zero
at exactly 6:03.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.611
- The food wasn't even ordered
until 6:16, which means--

09:28.655 --> 09:30.221
both: The killer ordered
the food!

09:30.265 --> 09:32.223
- Oh, God.
Did I talk to a murderer?

09:32.267 --> 09:33.703
- Jake, this guy saw the perp.

09:33.747 --> 09:35.183
We have to get him in front
of a sketch artist.

09:35.226 --> 09:36.401
- Oh, yeah.
I'm feeling it now, Rosa.

09:36.445 --> 09:38.273
At this time tomorrow,
we're gonna know

09:38.316 --> 09:39.970
exactly what our killer
looks like.

09:40.014 --> 09:42.146
- We have no idea
what our killer looks like.

09:42.190 --> 09:43.495
- Well, that's not
totally true.

09:43.539 --> 09:45.236
We now know that the killer
might look like

09:45.280 --> 09:47.674
Seth Myers, Winona Ryder,
or Bilbo Baggins.

09:47.717 --> 09:49.414
- The delivery guy
kept starting over.

09:49.458 --> 09:52.069
Apparently, he's always high.
I'm sorry, man.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.462
Our big break
turned into nothing.

09:53.505 --> 09:54.768
- Detectives.
- Ah! Captain.

09:54.811 --> 09:56.030
Did you come down here
to take a look

09:56.073 --> 09:57.335
at the two best detectives

09:57.379 --> 09:58.772
you've ever worked with
in action?

09:58.815 --> 10:00.121
- The two best detectives
I've ever worked with

10:00.164 --> 10:01.513
are Montez and Dillman.

10:01.557 --> 10:02.906
- Oh. You never
mentioned them before.

10:02.950 --> 10:04.299
- They were excellent.

10:04.342 --> 10:05.648
I'm here because Major Crimes
wants this case.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.171
I was hoping to tell them
you have some leads.

10:07.215 --> 10:09.739
I overheard you mention
a Bill Bo-Baggins.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.175
Should we bring him in?

10:11.219 --> 10:12.263
- Well, as much as I would
love to meet him,

10:12.307 --> 10:13.613
he is not a suspect.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.527
- Okay, so who is?
- At this time?

10:15.571 --> 10:16.920
No one.

10:16.964 --> 10:19.531
But... we are currently
investigating no leads.

10:19.575 --> 10:20.924
- So you have nothing.
- Not nothing.

10:20.968 --> 10:22.578
Jake made a new best friend.
The vic's mom.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.058
He promised her
he'd solve the case.

10:24.101 --> 10:25.494
- That's a rookie mistake.
- Okay.

10:25.537 --> 10:27.888
Fine. So maybe I'm not
Montana and Dilbert.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.454
- Montez and Dillman!

10:29.498 --> 10:31.413
And they would've remembered
your name after one mention.

10:31.456 --> 10:33.241
- Because we're memorable,
and they're not.

10:33.284 --> 10:34.634
Turned it around.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.113
- Nope.
- All right, look, Captain.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.680
Rosa and I are gonna solve
this case.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.551
The answer is in this room.
We just have to focus

10:39.595 --> 10:41.379
and let the room speak to us,
isn't that right, room?

10:41.423 --> 10:42.685
- When you talk to the room,

10:42.729 --> 10:44.252
I lose even more confidence
in you.

10:44.295 --> 10:45.775
- Why? Oh, wait, I see it.
All right.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.559
Can you please just buy us
some more time anyway?

10:47.603 --> 10:49.257
Sir, I feel like
we've earned this.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.694
- Fine. Work fast.
- You got it.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.478
Okay. Let's look at the scene
like we're seeing it

10:53.522 --> 10:54.741
for the first time
with fresh eyes.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.046
Vic was face down.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.439
- Cast-off splatter suggests
upward knife slices.

10:57.482 --> 10:58.658
- No signs of forced entry.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.355
Laptop, wallet, keys
were all there.

11:00.398 --> 11:01.704
both: Doesn't connote
a robbery.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.227
- Wait a minute.
Have we said this already?

11:03.271 --> 11:04.620
Are we just having the exact
same conversation?

11:04.664 --> 11:06.100
- Yep.
- Cool. Moving on.

11:06.143 --> 11:07.754
Windows and doors locked
from the inside.

11:07.797 --> 11:09.233
Nobody in or out.

11:09.277 --> 11:11.540
Think, think, think... oh!

11:11.583 --> 11:13.455
The upstairs neighbor
and his best friend

11:13.498 --> 11:15.326
drilled through the ceiling,
murdered Adams,

11:15.370 --> 11:17.720
bleed all over the apartment,
then climbed back up

11:17.764 --> 11:19.504
and sealed the hole
behind them!

11:19.548 --> 11:21.071
- Negative, we would have found
construction debris

11:21.115 --> 11:22.594
and microscopic paint fibers.

11:22.638 --> 11:24.292
The only thing
that needs patching...

11:24.335 --> 11:26.860
is that theory.

11:26.903 --> 11:28.383
- Okay. New idea.

11:28.426 --> 11:29.732
We're gonna get inside
the mind of the killer.

11:29.776 --> 11:32.300
We eat the veggie wraps.

11:32.343 --> 11:34.041
Here we go.

11:34.084 --> 11:36.260
Oh, this sick bastard.

11:36.304 --> 11:39.002
Oh, man.
This is one twisted mother.

11:39.046 --> 11:40.656
Oh, the beets are raw.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.527
This guy is demented, Rosa!

11:42.571 --> 11:44.051
Okay. All we have to do
is figure out

11:44.094 --> 11:45.705
what kind of person can walk
by cameras without being seen.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.184
Someone camouflaged as a wall.
- Unlikely.

11:47.228 --> 11:48.490
- Harry Potter
and his invisibility cloak.

11:48.533 --> 11:49.796
- Not a real person.
- Babadook.

11:49.839 --> 11:50.753
- Doesn't exist.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.015
- What about
a Looper situation?

11:52.059 --> 11:53.364
- It's not a Looper situation.

11:53.408 --> 11:54.452
- It could totally be
a Looper situation!

11:54.496 --> 11:55.584
- It's not a Looper situation.

11:55.627 --> 11:56.672
- This is my
least favorite hair!

11:56.716 --> 11:58.413
Oh, my God, Rosa, come here.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.545
Look at the blood spatter.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.504
Do you see what I see?
- Uh, blood.

12:02.547 --> 12:04.767
- In the exact shape
of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

12:04.811 --> 12:08.379
Pec, pec, delt, delt.
Big Samoan tattoo.

12:08.423 --> 12:10.468
Rosa. I think I just made
a connection.

12:10.512 --> 12:12.601
The number three is everywhere.

12:12.644 --> 12:14.472
Three people.
Three types of blood.

12:14.516 --> 12:18.041
And guess what the tax was
on the veggie wraps?

12:18.085 --> 12:19.651
Three dollars.

12:19.695 --> 12:23.568
And 19¢, but if you ignore
the 19, then it's three!

12:23.612 --> 12:25.048
- Okay. You've lost your mind.
- What? Who told you that?

12:25.092 --> 12:26.397
Was it room?

12:26.441 --> 12:28.095
- No. It's the fact
that you think

12:28.138 --> 12:29.792
the room has a voice and also
you're working in your boxers!

12:29.836 --> 12:32.577
- To beat the heat, Rosa!
To beat the heat!

12:32.621 --> 12:33.753
If we can't turn on the AC,

12:33.796 --> 12:35.232
that's not crazy,
it's just smart.

12:35.276 --> 12:37.278
- Jake. I gave the case
to Major Crimes.

12:37.321 --> 12:39.759
- What? You can't do that.
I promised Luan!

12:39.802 --> 12:41.282
- Yeah, and now
you can't let it go.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.284
The scene's yours, guys.

12:43.327 --> 12:45.112
I'm sorry, Jake.
It's over.

12:45.155 --> 12:47.244
- Okay, Rosa, fine!
I'll leave.

12:47.288 --> 12:48.506
Come on, room!

12:50.813 --> 12:52.772
- You left your pants.
- I don't care!

12:57.994 --> 12:59.735
- Hey, Jake.
- Ah!

12:59.779 --> 13:01.041
Hello, Rosa,
my coworker and friend.

13:01.084 --> 13:02.346
- Look, I know you're mad
at me,

13:02.390 --> 13:03.695
but I only gave away that case
to help you.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.132
You were acting like a lunatic.

13:05.175 --> 13:06.568
- Don't even worry about it.
You were totally right.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.222
I was in way too deep,
and honestly,

13:08.265 --> 13:09.876
I feel so free
not having to work

13:09.919 --> 13:11.573
that case anymore,
so thank you.

13:11.616 --> 13:14.576
- Cool, you're welcome.
What's up with all the ketchup?

13:14.619 --> 13:15.751
- Thank you for asking, Rosa.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.187
It's for my hot dog.

13:17.231 --> 13:18.667
Anyways, this has been
a great chat,

13:18.710 --> 13:20.451
but I better get back
to my hot dog.

13:22.932 --> 13:25.761
- Oh, wow.
- Ah! Hey!

13:25.805 --> 13:27.067
Rosa, guess what?

13:27.110 --> 13:28.633
There was no hot dog.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.070
Who's the lunatic now?

13:30.113 --> 13:31.506
- Still you, Jake.
- Yeah, right!

13:31.549 --> 13:33.247
There's nothing crazy
about this, sister.

13:33.290 --> 13:36.076
It's the crime scene:
stove, kitchen island,

13:36.119 --> 13:37.904
blood, and of course, the body.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.296
Hi, Rosa.

13:39.340 --> 13:40.167
I'm the body.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.646
- Shh. Stay in character!

13:41.690 --> 13:43.779
- Roger that.
- Let's get that blood on you.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.302
You gave away my case,
but guess what?

13:45.346 --> 13:46.695
I spent two months
in that apartment.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.088
I can recreate it in my sleep.

13:48.131 --> 13:49.785
- Have you slept?
- No.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.308
- What the hell is going on
in here?

13:51.352 --> 13:52.919
- Jake's gone insane
because he promised

13:52.962 --> 13:54.616
the victim's mom
he'd solve her son's murder.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.009
- Seriously?

13:56.052 --> 13:57.924
You never promise
a victim's relative anything.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.664
- Oh, please.
Classic Terry.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.536
Mr. Emotionless.
Sgt. Cold Heart.

14:01.579 --> 14:02.798
The man who bleeds ice.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.017
- I don't think
that rings true.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.322
- No?
- Clean it up and get out.

14:05.366 --> 14:06.367
You've lost your mind.

14:06.410 --> 14:07.542
- What? That's not true!

14:07.585 --> 14:08.891
Charles, tell him.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.545
- Well, actually,
he does have a point.

14:10.588 --> 14:12.112
- Really?
Oh, man, wow.

14:12.155 --> 14:14.288
I guess it really does take
your closest friends

14:14.331 --> 14:16.507
to make you realize
that you have crap friends

14:16.551 --> 14:20.076
that are idiots
and are dumb and idiots!

14:20.120 --> 14:22.513
I'm solving this.

14:22.557 --> 14:23.906
- Hey, we heard
there's a hot dog in here.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.473
- No. Jake lied for no reason.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.301
- That son of a bitch!

14:30.913 --> 14:32.306
- Oh, hey, babe.

14:32.349 --> 14:34.656
-  Ugh!
It's me, Jake!

14:34.699 --> 14:36.832
I'm just working!
What is wrong with you?

14:36.876 --> 14:38.181
- What are you doing?
Why do you have a knife?

14:38.225 --> 14:40.053
Why am I covered
in red Post-its?

14:40.096 --> 14:41.968
- That's blood.
You're the corpse.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.447
Jake, who is that?

14:43.491 --> 14:44.753
- Franco McCoy. CSI.

14:44.796 --> 14:46.059
- He's helping me
with the case.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.060
- For the record,
I think it's weird

14:47.103 --> 14:48.061
that I'm here too.

14:48.104 --> 14:49.453
- Both of you, get out!

14:49.497 --> 14:50.454
- Yeah, sounds good.

14:50.498 --> 14:51.455
- Sorry to wake you.

14:51.499 --> 14:52.500
Sweet dreams.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.110
- Come on.

14:54.154 --> 14:57.113
Okay, so, no one went in,
no one came out.

14:57.157 --> 14:58.680
The lab confirmed
that the surveillance footage

14:58.723 --> 15:00.551
wasn't tampered with.

15:00.595 --> 15:03.250
So what happened in there,
Olive Rosa?

15:03.293 --> 15:04.991
- I don't know.
- Ah! You can talk.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.166
Oh. Rosa.

15:06.209 --> 15:07.776
It's just you.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.865
I thought I was really going
crazy for a second there.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.693
It was just person Rosa.

15:11.736 --> 15:13.260
- You look like crap.

15:13.303 --> 15:14.826
- You look like a freshman
at an all-women's college.

15:14.870 --> 15:15.958
- I don't think you're in
a position

15:16.002 --> 15:17.090
to be offering criticism
right now.

15:17.133 --> 15:19.048
- More than fair.

15:19.092 --> 15:20.615
- I'm worried about you, man.

15:20.658 --> 15:22.443
- Yeah. I can't figure it out.

15:22.486 --> 15:24.097
- Then you gotta let it go.
- I can't do that either.

15:24.140 --> 15:25.794
- Look, I know you want
to help this woman,

15:25.837 --> 15:27.056
but there are other cases.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.405
There are other people
that need your help,

15:28.449 --> 15:31.191
and right now,
you're not helping anyone.

15:31.234 --> 15:32.496
You gotta tell her it's over.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.890
- I don't know
if I can do that.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.370
- Then I'll go with you.

15:36.413 --> 15:38.894
I forced you to be there
when I came out to my parents.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.853
I owe you.

15:41.897 --> 15:44.204
- All right.

15:44.247 --> 15:46.075
We've exhausted every lead,

15:46.119 --> 15:48.338
We have checked every alibi,

15:48.382 --> 15:50.558
and we have followed
every last piece of forensics,

15:50.601 --> 15:53.953
so I guess what I'm trying
to say is...

15:56.781 --> 16:01.134
I can't find your son's killer.

16:01.177 --> 16:02.352
- I understand.

16:02.396 --> 16:04.180
Thank you for trying
as hard as you did.

16:04.224 --> 16:05.747
I really hoped you'd find him.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.749
- Well, don't lose hope,
because Major Crimes

16:07.792 --> 16:10.012
is on the case as we speak,
and they're very--

16:10.056 --> 16:11.405
- Oh, they already
contacted me.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.798
Because it's been so long
without any new leads,

16:13.842 --> 16:16.018
they've labeled it a cold case.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.760
They said I shouldn't
hold out hope.

16:18.803 --> 16:20.544
I'm sorry.

16:20.588 --> 16:23.199
It's not you.

16:23.243 --> 16:25.158
I just can't stop
feeling guilty.

16:25.201 --> 16:27.856
Andrew and I were not
on the best of terms.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.249
We had this huge fight,

16:29.292 --> 16:32.252
and we hadn't spoken
in almost a year.

16:32.295 --> 16:35.472
I just wish I could've made it
right when I had the chance.

16:35.516 --> 16:37.648
- I'm very sorry to hear that,
but I'm sure--

16:37.692 --> 16:39.041
- We're gonna find
your son's killer.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.390
- What?

16:40.434 --> 16:42.262
- Jake and I are jumping back
on the case.

16:42.305 --> 16:44.394
We'll make sure your son
gets the justice he deserves.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.005
I promise.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.049
- Thank you.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.057
- Rosa?

16:55.101 --> 16:57.755
-  She just reminds me
of my mom.

16:57.799 --> 16:59.061
- Oh, boy.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.415
- So, we gonna talk about
what happened back there?

17:05.459 --> 17:07.026
I haven't seen someone cry
that much

17:07.069 --> 17:08.636
since Charles heard they were
remaking "First Wives Club."

17:08.679 --> 17:10.029
- It sort of bothers me
that my mom

17:10.072 --> 17:11.247
hasn't talked to me
since I came out.

17:11.291 --> 17:12.553
- Why don't you just give her
a call?

17:12.596 --> 17:13.597
- Because I shouldn't have to.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.077
It's her issue, not mine.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.861
I mean, I'm glad I came out
to her, it's just,

17:16.905 --> 17:18.341
it's taking her way longer
to come around

17:18.385 --> 17:19.342
than I thought it would.

17:19.386 --> 17:21.083
It sucks.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.911
That's weird.
The police tape's already gone.

17:22.954 --> 17:24.565
- Oh, yeah, Major Crimes
released the scene yesterday.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.001
But I'm sure
they haven't had time

17:26.045 --> 17:28.177
to clean up the evidence...

17:28.221 --> 17:30.701
- Oh, man, they emptied
the place out.

17:30.745 --> 17:31.920
Nothing left in here.

17:31.963 --> 17:33.704
I can't believe
this is how it ends.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.619
- Yeah. Is it weird
that I miss the smell?

17:37.056 --> 17:39.188
Wait a minute,
do you hear that?

17:39.232 --> 17:40.885
I've spent 600 hours
in this room,

17:40.929 --> 17:42.104
and I have never heard
that sound.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.323
- It's because
the air conditioning's

17:43.366 --> 17:44.541
never been turned on.

17:44.585 --> 17:46.326
It's coming from that vent.

17:49.372 --> 17:50.765
- I don't see anything.

17:50.808 --> 17:54.116
Wait, there's a bend.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.118
Oh, my God.

17:56.162 --> 17:59.556
There's food and water in here!

17:59.600 --> 18:01.384
Rosa. We never saw the killer
leave this apartment

18:01.428 --> 18:02.951
because he never left.

18:02.994 --> 18:04.344
- But he couldn't have survived
in there for months.

18:04.387 --> 18:05.519
That's insane.

18:05.562 --> 18:06.868
- He wasn't back there
for months.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.130
He just waited for the body
to be discovered

18:08.174 --> 18:09.697
and then snuck out
sometime after that.

18:09.740 --> 18:10.872
- But this place was crawling
with cops.

18:10.915 --> 18:12.003
- Which is exactly
what he wanted.

18:12.047 --> 18:13.092
He snuck out
dressed like a cop.

18:13.135 --> 18:14.354
- Even if he had a uniform,

18:14.397 --> 18:16.138
somebody would've
recognized him.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.487
- Not if his face was covered.
- By a hazmat suit.

18:17.531 --> 18:19.010
The CSI guys!

18:19.054 --> 18:20.229
Franco said he had 14 techs,
but didn't you count 15?

18:20.273 --> 18:22.275
- I did count 15!
My math was right!

18:22.318 --> 18:23.798
Suck it, Mrs. Skanga!

18:23.841 --> 18:25.147
She was my Algebra II teacher.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.888
She threw a protractor
at my head.

18:26.931 --> 18:28.324
- She sucks.
- She sucked!

18:28.368 --> 18:29.978
Actually, she was very sweet.
She believed in me.

18:30.021 --> 18:31.849
- Oh.
- Yeah.

18:31.893 --> 18:33.503
- Here's the security footage.

18:33.547 --> 18:35.853
It's rated G for Gonna Get Got.

18:35.897 --> 18:38.465
- Less is more, Franco.
Play the tape.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.554
- Okay, so there's us arriving.

18:40.597 --> 18:41.903
Oh, man, is that how I walk?

18:41.946 --> 18:43.339
- Yes.
- Should I change how I walk?

18:43.383 --> 18:45.036
- Yes.
- All right. Wait. Go back.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.516
- Jake, we don't have time
to fix your walk.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.083
It's gonna take a lot of work,
and we're very busy.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.693
- No. Look.
Look at this guy.

18:49.737 --> 18:52.348
All the other techs are wearing
booties, but he's not.

18:52.392 --> 18:53.915
- Follow that guy.

18:55.612 --> 18:58.876
Where's the footage from
the bodega across the street?

18:58.920 --> 19:01.705
- We have that?
That is so crazy.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.403
We are under surveillance
at all times.

19:03.446 --> 19:05.361
I'm sure it's fine and it won't
backfire and ruin society.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.363
Zoom in on his face.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.191
- That man's not CSI.

19:09.235 --> 19:10.061
- No, Franco.

19:10.105 --> 19:12.542
But he is about to say...

19:12.586 --> 19:14.153
CS-Bye.

19:14.196 --> 19:16.720
Yeah-ow!

19:16.764 --> 19:18.896
- Respect, Jake.
Respect.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.031
- Okay, Rosa.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.380
You know what it's time for.
- I do.

19:24.424 --> 19:25.860
both: Jake and Rosa's
final impressions.

19:25.903 --> 19:26.904
- Your client's a hit man.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.297
He snuck into the apartment

19:28.341 --> 19:29.559
during a party
several nights earlier,

19:29.603 --> 19:30.821
hid in the vent for three days,

19:30.865 --> 19:32.606
then emerged
and murdered Adams. Jake?

19:32.649 --> 19:34.216
- He then spilled bags of blood

19:34.260 --> 19:35.826
that he stole from a blood bank
all over the floor

19:35.870 --> 19:37.393
and turned on
the victim's vacuum cleaner

19:37.437 --> 19:39.395
to make the crime scene
as messy as possible. Rosa?

19:39.439 --> 19:41.180
- The messy scene meant
there'd be extra crime techs,

19:41.223 --> 19:43.007
allowing your client
to sneak out in a hazmat suit,

19:43.051 --> 19:44.400
which records show
he bought online.

19:44.444 --> 19:45.967
- Two weeks before the crime
was committed.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.577
My only question is,

19:47.621 --> 19:48.752
who was behind all this?

19:48.796 --> 19:50.493
- I was hired
by a chicken farmer.

19:50.537 --> 19:51.842
- Okay. Dopeness taking
a late hit here,

19:51.886 --> 19:53.366
but we still got you.

19:53.409 --> 19:56.107
See you at the sentencing,
peace, and we're out.

19:56.151 --> 19:57.239
- He's pleading guilty.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.545
- Oh, thank God.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.111
But why did he kill Andrew?

20:00.155 --> 20:01.678
Was he doing something bad?

20:01.722 --> 20:02.940
- Not at all.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.115
He was about to publish
an exposé

20:04.159 --> 20:05.465
on a large-scale poultry farm

20:05.508 --> 20:07.510
whose owner was bribing
an FDA regulator.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.077
He put a hit out on your son.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.513
- Well, is anybody
going after him?

20:10.557 --> 20:12.863
- If they're not, then I will.
I promise you.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.389
- Come here.
- Oh.

20:17.607 --> 20:19.130
-  Why are
you promising her?

20:19.174 --> 20:21.132
-  I can't
help myself!

20:21.176 --> 20:22.960
- Good-bye, detectives.

20:23.004 --> 20:25.398
- Take care.

20:25.441 --> 20:27.313
I gotta say, we would not
have solved that case

20:27.356 --> 20:29.140
if you hadn't gotten involved
emotionally.

20:29.184 --> 20:31.273
Think we'd be better cops
if we did that all the time?

20:31.317 --> 20:32.579
- Absolutely not, never again.

20:32.622 --> 20:33.797
- Yeah, it was
a total nightmare.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.277
You want to get
a celebratory drink?

20:35.321 --> 20:36.800
- I would, but I'm actually
meeting somebody.

20:36.844 --> 20:38.106
- Is it Jocelyn?
Do I get to meet Jocelyn?

20:38.149 --> 20:39.150
Oh, God, is she gonna try
and cut my hair?

20:39.194 --> 20:40.500
- No. It's my mom.

20:40.543 --> 20:41.849
I waited too long
for her to come around

20:41.892 --> 20:42.893
and call me, so I called her.

20:42.937 --> 20:44.808
- That is so great.

20:44.852 --> 20:46.375
Oh, no.
Is she meeting you here?

20:46.419 --> 20:47.811
Am I about to get caught
in the middle

20:47.855 --> 20:49.160
of all your weird awkwardness
again?

20:49.204 --> 20:52.163
- Hello, Jake.
- Ah! Hello, Mrs. Diaz!

20:52.207 --> 20:55.863
America's favorite mother!

20:58.866 --> 21:00.346
- So?

21:00.389 --> 21:01.651
- So.

21:01.695 --> 21:03.262
- So...

21:03.305 --> 21:04.045
Rosa's bi.

21:04.088 --> 21:05.351
- Yes, Jake, I remember.

21:05.394 --> 21:07.004
- Cool. Cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool...

21:07.048 --> 21:09.093
- You don't have to stay, man.
- Great. Thanks.

21:09.137 --> 21:11.792
- It's really good to see you,
Rosalita.

21:11.835 --> 21:15.578
- It's good to see you too.

21:15.622 --> 21:17.450
- What did you do to your hair?
- Mom!

21:17.493 --> 21:18.842
- No, no, no,
it's very cute, mija.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.976
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.

21:22.019 --> 21:24.239
- Fremulon.
