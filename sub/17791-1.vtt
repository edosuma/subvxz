00:37.287 --> 00:38.538
NARRATOR: The film
which you are about to see

00:38.664 --> 00:43.749
is an account of the crimes committed
by Karen Bird and Jack Blueblood.

00:43.877 --> 00:49.622
By June of 1974, they would
be responsible for 11 homicides

00:49.758 --> 00:52.670
and wanted dead or alive
in six US states.

01:04.940 --> 01:08.228
Karen Bird was born in the shadow
of the Appalachian Mountains

01:08.360 --> 01:12.774
in Chattanooga, Tennessee,
on January 24th 1956.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.942
She weighed six pounds eight ounces

01:15.075 --> 01:19.739
and was described by the hospital staff
as being a particularly pleasant baby.

01:21.331 --> 01:24.198
Jack Blueblood was born a half-breed
seven years earlier

01:24.334 --> 01:27.417
on an Indian reservation
in South Dakota.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.379
His father was a Lakota Sioux

01:30.507 --> 01:34.170
and his mother, who died giving birth,
was Irish Catholic.

01:35.929 --> 01:39.638
Try as he might, Jack's father
could never forgive his son

01:39.767 --> 01:42.053
for taking away the love of his life.

01:42.186 --> 01:44.268
(BEATING)

01:45.856 --> 01:50.475
Not a day went by that young Jack
wasn't reminded of his guilt.

01:50.611 --> 01:56.607
Unlike Jack, Karen grew up
a model child in a model American town.

01:56.742 --> 02:00.701
The only symptom of her budding
misbehavior was an aversion to church,

02:00.829 --> 02:05.994
and CCD,
and an obsession with guns.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.037
(CLATTERS)

02:08.170 --> 02:11.128
Jack inherited from his mother
a sweet tooth,

02:11.256 --> 02:14.669
her good looks,
and an extensive record collection.

02:16.011 --> 02:22.598
When Elvis Presley broke in 1955,
Jack became his disciple.

02:25.646 --> 02:29.389
In Elvis and his music,
Jack felt something ancient.

02:29.525 --> 02:33.609
Something primal.
He felt freedom.

02:36.156 --> 02:40.445
Both Jack and Karen would continue
to lead aimless, reckless lives

02:40.577 --> 02:43.159
throughout their adolescence,

02:43.288 --> 02:48.123
both searching for something better,
something more,

02:48.252 --> 02:52.291
something elusive
they couldn't quite define.

02:52.422 --> 02:56.415
It was only a matter of time before
this yearning led them to one another.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.968
They would eventually meet

03:00.097 --> 03:02.133
at the Second Chances
Rehabilitation Clinic

03:02.266 --> 03:04.131
located in Floodwood, Michigan.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.302
Karen was sent there involuntarily
by her parents

03:08.438 --> 03:10.303
after she was suspended
from high school

03:10.440 --> 03:14.979
and turned to nicotine,
vodka and teenage boys.

03:15.863 --> 03:19.526
Jack was sent there by the state
for his barbiturate addiction

03:19.658 --> 03:23.822
and an increasingly abnormal obsession
with Elvis Presley.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.240
Well, at the time of your evaluation,

03:26.373 --> 03:29.490
you said that Elvis
was straying from the righteous path

03:29.626 --> 03:33.585
and it was your duty
to guide his soul to salvation.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.204
Yep.

03:36.425 --> 03:39.542
Diagnosed with a delusional disorder,

03:39.678 --> 03:44.672
Jack was prescribed daily sessions
of electroshock therapy

03:44.808 --> 03:46.969
at twice the recommended dosage.

03:47.102 --> 03:48.717
(SIZZLES)

03:51.064 --> 03:56.934
On March 13th 1974, Karen and Jack
would cross paths for the first time,

03:57.070 --> 03:59.777
setting in motion one
of the most destructive love affairs

03:59.907 --> 04:02.193
in the annals of US crime.

04:02.326 --> 04:03.816
JACK: Get your fuckin' paws off me, man!

04:03.952 --> 04:07.820
My people was born here in this dirt
and I'll do as I goddamn please!

04:08.916 --> 04:10.281
Can I help you?

04:10.417 --> 04:11.406
(CLATTERS)

04:37.778 --> 04:42.898
So what's a pretty girl like you doing
here stuck with all these juggle heads?

04:43.033 --> 04:45.365
I don't know.

04:45.494 --> 04:49.328
My parents thought I should take it easy
for a while, I guess.

04:49.456 --> 04:52.539
- I got nerves.
- Yeah, they say I got the nerves too.

04:53.752 --> 04:57.085
I mean, how can't a smart person
with a brain have the nerves?

04:57.214 --> 05:00.047
You see the world we live in?
You gotta wonder.

05:00.175 --> 05:02.291
It's the people that don't have nerves

05:02.427 --> 05:05.043
who should be locked up in here,
Ithink.

05:05.180 --> 05:09.298
- They're the real suspicious ones.
- Yeah, I guess.

05:11.603 --> 05:14.720
- So what's your name?
- Karen.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.984
- That's a pretty name.
- Thanks.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.314
My name's Jack Blueblood.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.437
(CHATTER OVER WALKIE-TALKIE)

05:27.703 --> 05:28.818
Can I see you again?

05:30.080 --> 05:32.947
- Maybe.
- I gotta get.

05:41.800 --> 05:45.213
Hey. He's in the ladies' room.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.011
(MUFFLED VOICES)

05:53.145 --> 05:54.180
- (LOUD THUD)
- GUARD: Ow!

05:54.312 --> 05:56.519
(GLASS SHATTERS)

05:56.648 --> 06:00.857
Ijust don't wanna be some...

06:02.029 --> 06:03.860
Chattanooga chambermaid.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.897
I want something different.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.650
Like what, Karen?

06:11.621 --> 06:16.331
- I don't know really.
- And that is the crux of your anxiety.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.208
The unknown.

06:21.256 --> 06:24.123
- You mind if I have a smoke?
- No.

06:34.853 --> 06:37.686
- Dr Sanborn, can I ask you something?
- Of course.

06:38.940 --> 06:42.148
Why is that Jack Blueblood guy here?

06:42.277 --> 06:45.815
Because he hears voices in his head
that tell him to kill.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.648
- I also think he might be queer.
- (LAUGHS)

06:49.785 --> 06:52.743
You can laugh if you want to but
Jack Blueblood is a very dangerous man.

06:52.871 --> 06:56.580
You need to stay away from him.
Trust me.

07:06.802 --> 07:10.511
On top of solar flares and sun spots,

07:10.639 --> 07:13.221
what I'm really most freaked about
is pandemics.

07:14.518 --> 07:16.429
Toby! Get!

07:21.316 --> 07:23.227
Checkmate.

07:25.737 --> 07:29.195
Little birdie told me
you snitched on my hiding spot.

07:29.324 --> 07:30.564
Oh, yeah?

07:30.700 --> 07:35.285
Look, sugar tits, I don't know
who the fuck you think you are,

07:35.413 --> 07:37.119
but there's rules around here.

07:37.249 --> 07:39.035
Don't call me sugar tits.

07:39.167 --> 07:43.410
Rule number one, I'll call you
whatever the fuck I wanna call you.

07:43.547 --> 07:46.459
Rule two, do not cross me.

07:49.136 --> 07:52.924
I carry artillery in my bootjust like
the King and I ain't afraid to use it.

07:54.057 --> 07:57.049
I'm 50% Irish, 50% Lakota Sioux.

08:02.107 --> 08:04.268
I'm 100% white trash.

08:08.363 --> 08:11.196
NARRATOR: Jack and Karen
fell for each other quickly.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.450
According to an entry
in Karen's diary at the time,

08:19.583 --> 08:22.541
Jack is unlike anyone
she'd ever met before.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.785
KAREN: Sure, he's crazy but he's alive.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.334
He's got mercury for blood
and fire in his eyes.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.957
And although he might look rough
and primitive,

08:31.094 --> 08:33.585
deep down he's sensitive and kind.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.964
Last week at movie night,
he cried during "Pride of the Yankees ",

08:37.100 --> 08:41.764
and he whittled me a statuette of
the Virgin Mary out of a bar of Lava.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.772
He says that sometimes
his head feels like it's crowded

08:45.901 --> 08:49.814
with a bunch of black dogs who won't
quit barking. It drives him mad.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.858
And I can relate to that feeling.

08:53.825 --> 08:57.613
Plus we tell each other secrets
we ain't never told anyone before.

08:57.746 --> 09:02.786
When I was eight years old, I killed
a baby bluebird just to watch it die.

09:02.918 --> 09:04.499
I feel bad about that.

09:05.837 --> 09:08.704
I like The Beach Boys
more than The Beatles.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.707
Don't tell anyone. It's controversial.

09:13.053 --> 09:17.922
My one true dream in life
is to step foot into the Pacific Ocean,

09:18.058 --> 09:23.928
feel the warm frothy water on my legs,
breathe in the fresh salty air.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.267
Your turn.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.021
I hate my daddy.

09:31.154 --> 09:35.739
My favorite month of the year is October
when the air smells all wet and fun.

09:36.660 --> 09:39.402
When I listen to Elvis,
it's like the gospel.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.368
Those two minutes and 30 seconds

09:41.498 --> 09:46.367
I forget I'm just a kid trapped
in a box somewhere waiting to die.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.164
I'm free, baby.

10:08.733 --> 10:13.898
You are the most beautiful, most far-out
chick I've ever seen in my whole life.

10:17.409 --> 10:21.027
NARRATOR: Karen had never felt this way
about a boy before.

10:22.205 --> 10:27.416
When she was with him she didn't feel
that funny, lonesome feeling,

10:27.544 --> 10:29.751
and neither did he.

10:30.880 --> 10:36.170
But this carefree time
would soon come to an end.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.395
PATIENT: Felt like the walls
were caving in,

10:49.524 --> 10:53.984
like the air was disappearing
and the sky was falling.

10:54.112 --> 10:58.776
Like nothing was real no more
and I was being erased from it all.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.366
Like I was being rubbed out.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.787
DOCTOR: Very courageous.
Thank you for sharing that.

11:05.915 --> 11:09.533
DOCTOR: All right, everyone,
let's discuss what Toby told us.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.377
(KNOCKING)

11:20.930 --> 11:24.263
- Who's there?
- JACK: It's me, baby. Open up.

11:24.392 --> 11:28.055
- What's the password?
- JACK: Pretty please. Open up.

11:35.320 --> 11:39.279
I gotta tell you something.
I gotta tell you something. Hold on.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.023
What?

11:42.077 --> 11:45.695
Now, we've been going steady
for a couple of weeks now. Right?

11:45.830 --> 11:47.991
So there's something
you should know about me.

11:48.124 --> 11:51.867
- OK.
- A couple of years back...

11:52.837 --> 11:55.920
My dead mama made contact with me.

11:56.049 --> 12:01.510
She told me that I gotta kill Elvis.

12:03.681 --> 12:06.809
NARRATOR: By 1972,
it had become clear to Jack

12:06.935 --> 12:11.895
that a distinct change had occurred
in Elvis and his music.

12:12.023 --> 12:16.938
Shortly after the "Aloha From Hawaii "
special, while high on mezcal...

12:17.070 --> 12:18.401
(BACKWARDS SINGING)

12:18.530 --> 12:21.988
...Jack accidentally spun
his favorite Elvis record backwards,

12:22.117 --> 12:24.779
and claimed to have heard a message
from his dead mother

12:24.911 --> 12:26.993
spinning in the grooves of the wax.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.955
(DISTORTED VOICE)
KiII Elvis.

12:31.751 --> 12:35.209
KiII Elvis.

12:36.172 --> 12:39.664
KiII Elvis.

12:41.010 --> 12:44.218
KiII Elvis.

12:44.347 --> 12:48.431
KiII Elvis.

12:51.896 --> 12:55.059
Elvis, like Elvis Elvis?

12:55.191 --> 12:57.898
Look, I knew you were gonna say that
and I know it sounds crazy, baby,

12:58.027 --> 13:02.396
but you gotta trust me on this one, OK?
Look, I got proof.

13:03.992 --> 13:09.658
Elvis is playing the Sports Coliseum
in Los Angeles, California, on May 11th.

13:10.832 --> 13:14.370
Which also happens
to be my dead mama's birthday.

13:14.502 --> 13:18.290
Now, does that sound like a coincidence
to you? Cos it don't to me.

13:18.423 --> 13:21.130
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm gonna bust out of here.

13:21.259 --> 13:24.422
I'm gonna hitch west
and I'm gonna kill the son of a bitch.

13:25.889 --> 13:28.346
Are you gonna come with me, sunshine?

13:28.475 --> 13:30.716
You always said
you wanted to see the ocean.

13:34.898 --> 13:39.016
The beaches and the sunscreen.
Don't you just love that smell?

13:40.028 --> 13:42.144
I thought you loved Elvis, Jack.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.279
I do.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.900
So then why would your mama
want you to kill him?

13:49.871 --> 13:51.782
I don't know, Karen.

13:51.915 --> 13:56.750
I've been waiting on a sign from my mama
just to make sure this is 100%,

13:56.878 --> 13:58.459
and then this came in the mail today.

13:58.588 --> 14:02.126
This is my destiny, Karen.
It's my calling.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.255
I need you to come with me.

14:12.602 --> 14:16.595
Look, I ain't never had the courage
to do this till I met you.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.941
Hey. What I tell you two about
being in each other's rooms, huh?

14:22.070 --> 14:24.982
Fuck off. Get off me.
Hey, just think about it, OK?

NARRATOR: By the time
the police arrived,

17:36.764 --> 17:41.929
Jack and Karen had hotwired a 1961
Cadillac DeVille and hit the road.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.723
They would arrive in LA eventually,

She had parents who loved her,
affluence, good looks.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.628
She had every privilege in life.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.125
She should have been a debutante.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.359
Jack?

19:15.780 --> 19:18.146
You think you're going
to heaven or hell?

19:24.497 --> 19:27.113
Eternity anywhere sounds like hell.

19:28.292 --> 19:31.705
After 2,000 years of playing baseball
and flying around,

19:31.838 --> 19:34.500
I think I'd be looking for a way out.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.672
You know what I think?

19:42.765 --> 19:44.346
Close your eyes.

19:52.483 --> 19:56.146
KAREN: I think it's like this.
But forever.

19:57.864 --> 20:03.860
# Hmm, mm-mm-mm

20:05.162 --> 20:11.783
# Hmm, mm-mm-mm

20:12.837 --> 20:18.878

20:21.262 --> 20:24.049
# To the dark side

20:24.181 --> 20:28.550

20:30.229 --> 20:37.442

(HUMS)

21:13.439 --> 21:14.975
(RADIO JINGLE)

21:20.571 --> 21:22.948
OVER RADIO: A select committee
of the United States Senate

21:23.074 --> 21:26.737
is about to begin pubic hearings
on something called Watergate.

21:26.869 --> 21:29.360
One year ago today,
Watergate was just an address,

21:29.497 --> 21:32.409
a rather fancy, expensive address
in this capital city,

21:32.541 --> 21:35.203
but now it has come to symbolize
much more.

21:35.336 --> 21:39.579
The word "crisis" is perhaps too mild
to apply to Watergate.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.831
President Nixon's White House
has been shaken,

21:41.968 --> 21:44.960
indeed the entire executive branch
of the government

21:45.096 --> 21:49.089
has been jolted by the continuing
accusations and revelations.

21:49.225 --> 21:52.683
Most of them, it must be kept in mind,
not yet proved.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.473
Seven men, only seven men,

21:54.605 --> 21:56.846
have been convicted
for their part in the burglary.

21:56.983 --> 22:02.694
We see now Senator Sam Ervin,
who is the chairman of the...

22:08.911 --> 22:12.870
NARRATOR: Elvis Presley,
despite all his trying otherwise,

22:12.999 --> 22:16.537
had somehow gotten caught
in the lazy river of time.

22:17.586 --> 22:20.749
At 39 years old,
he had more than betrayed

22:20.881 --> 22:23.748
the fresh-faced boy from Memphis
he once was.

22:23.884 --> 22:26.796
You know, I just sing the only way
I know how to, really.

22:26.929 --> 22:30.922
And people seem to like that,
so I'm real glad about that. I'm lucky.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.434
What do you plan on doing

22:32.560 --> 22:34.926
after this whole rock and roll thing
has run its course?

22:36.564 --> 22:39.681
Well, um... [don't know, sir.

22:39.817 --> 22:42.399
Maybe I'll go back to being
an electrician or something like that.

22:42.528 --> 22:45.361
NARRATOR: But rock and roll
had never run its course.

22:45.489 --> 22:48.151
For better or for worse,
it was here for good,

22:48.284 --> 22:50.866
and Elvis was its accidental king.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.451
(GIRLS SCREAM)

22:53.914 --> 22:58.078
A king navigating the zeitgeist
of a time and people

22:58.210 --> 22:59.825
he didn't always understand.

23:01.255 --> 23:05.715
After this rehearsal, you have
a one o'clock meeting with Mr Beefy.

23:05.843 --> 23:10.837
People who had led him astray, who had
made him their song-and-dance man,

23:10.973 --> 23:13.510
and when they got bored,
stopped seeing his movies,

23:13.642 --> 23:15.974
stopped listening, really listening,

23:16.103 --> 23:19.436
to the voice that had grabbed them
by the shirt collars

23:19.565 --> 23:21.647
and shook their souls.

23:31.118 --> 23:34.656
The summer tour of 1974,
his first in years,

23:34.789 --> 23:39.203
was a concentrated effort to win back
those who had strayed from the King.

23:39.335 --> 23:42.293
To reassert his seat at the throne.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.788
The first date,
at the Los Angeles Sports Coliseum,

23:45.925 --> 23:50.510
was to be the big send-off.
They had been planning it for weeks.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.470
What is it?

23:57.937 --> 24:01.304
# That powers throughout

24:01.440 --> 24:06.184
# The universe displayed

24:06.320 --> 24:08.356
That's it.

24:08.489 --> 24:11.322
MAN: All right, Elvis,
we should take ten, I think.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.121
All right, damn it, don't...

24:19.708 --> 24:20.993
(CLATTERS)

24:21.127 --> 24:22.867
Don't tell me
when to take a break, all right?

24:23.003 --> 24:25.460
We're doing a song up here,
we finish the song.

24:25.589 --> 24:27.500
And yet mere days away from the show...

24:27.633 --> 24:28.713
That's just unheard of.

24:28.843 --> 24:32.506
...Elvis was ill prepared.
He was 20 pounds too heavy.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.424
You boys don't listen to him,
you listen to me.

24:34.557 --> 24:36.923
And his voice was unrehearsed.

24:37.059 --> 24:40.643
Perhaps worst of all,
he didn't really care.

24:40.771 --> 24:44.855
And it was that nihilism,
that black-hole feeling in his chest,

24:44.984 --> 24:46.724
that scared him the most.

24:46.861 --> 24:48.146
All right, take ten, let's do it.

24:48.279 --> 24:50.986
- MAN 1: Cut. Slate.
- MAN 2: 634, 278 to nine.

24:52.158 --> 24:57.243
But Elvis was a religious man.
He prayed for redemption.

24:57.371 --> 25:00.363
He prayed for a return to glory.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.449
Somebody get me another Coke, please?

25:03.586 --> 25:08.330
And little did he know...
salvation was on its way.

25:10.134 --> 25:15.470
KAREN: Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

25:15.598 --> 25:20.718
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

25:20.853 --> 25:25.722
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses,

25:25.858 --> 25:28.850
as we forgive those
that trespass against us.

25:30.196 --> 25:34.064
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

25:35.117 --> 25:36.573

on the reservation

26:10.236 --> 26:11.146
was another outsider,

26:11.278 --> 26:15.191
a slight-figured nancy boy
by the name of Teijo Littlefoot.

26:15.324 --> 26:18.532
I was going for a kind of ethereal
Joni Mitchell by way of Paul Bunyan

26:18.661 --> 26:20.242
for the decorating scheme.

26:20.371 --> 26:25.786
A lot of kinda like feminine trinkets
next to masculine kniCk-knacks.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.328
I made that one.

26:27.461 --> 26:31.329
Oh! And I got these cute little
thingamajigs at the dollar store.

26:31.465 --> 26:33.046
- Aren't they cute?
- Mm-hmm.

26:33.175 --> 26:36.417
They remind me always to smile
even if I'm feeling blue.

26:37.763 --> 26:41.381
So, Jack, what you in town for, huh?
You all right?

26:41.517 --> 26:42.973
Right as rain, Teijo.

26:43.894 --> 26:46.886
We had to kill a few folks back
at the loony bin so we're on the lam.

26:47.022 --> 26:51.857
- We're headed to LA.
- Los Angeles. Oh, my goodness!

Hey, Jack, could you take me with you?

26:57.366 --> 26:58.606
(LAUGHS)

26:58.742 --> 27:00.403
I don't think so, Teej.

27:00.536 --> 27:02.618
Oh, come on, please.
I get so bored here.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.862
All I do is watch
this stupid television.

27:04.999 --> 27:06.990
And when nothing's on,
I hang out with Kimbo.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.242
Do you remember Kimbo,
the little handicapped kid?

27:09.378 --> 27:12.120
He's so annoying.

27:12.256 --> 27:16.966
Look, you don't wanna get yourself
mixed up or killed on our account, OK?

27:17.094 --> 27:21.133
We got an objective. We can't have
any dead weight. I'm sorry, buddy.

- Oh, my. You're finally doing it, huh?
- That's right.

This is big. This is big.
He's been thinking about this for years.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.597
That's exactly right.

27:31.734 --> 27:34.316
That's why I'm gonna
need to get that map I gave to you.

Yeah.

27:37.865 --> 27:39.730
NARRATOR: Before Jack was committed,

27:39.867 --> 27:42.859
he had buried
a duffel bag full of guns,

27:42.995 --> 27:46.453
money
and rare first-edition comic books.

27:46.582 --> 27:49.540
He drew out a map of its location
and wrote the directions in pig Latin

27:49.668 --> 27:52.159
and entrusted it
in Teijo's safe-keeping

27:52.296 --> 27:53.832
while he was away from home.

27:53.964 --> 27:57.752
Teijo, this is all I have.

27:58.635 --> 28:01.092
This is everything.

28:01.221 --> 28:06.090
You're my best friend but if you
fuck this up, I will kill you.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.559
You can trust me, Jack.

TEIJO: Oh, I must have seen that movie,
Midnight Cowboy, I don't know,

28:17.780 --> 28:20.237
like seven times in the theater.
It was so good.

the two queer men?

they were friends.

before I come over there.

What the fuck are you talking about?!

supposed to make you more womanly.

36:51.293 --> 36:53.625
(WHOOPS AND LAUGHS)

37:09.603 --> 37:13.937
NARRATOR: Karen's usually sedated suburb
found itself in a media frenzy

37:14.065 --> 37:19.856
not seen since the high-school
football team won state 16 years prior.

37:19.988 --> 37:22.195
The death count is now five.

37:22.324 --> 37:28.115
Jack Blueblood and Karen Bird,
lovers, dreamers, serial killers.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.828
FEMALE REPORTER: Karen Bird,
the silver-spoon delinquent,

37:30.957 --> 37:31.992
enjoyed riding her bike,

37:32.125 --> 37:36.835
donating to charity, and participating
in religious education.

37:36.963 --> 37:38.544
Then something went astray.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.413
I didn't really know her.

37:40.550 --> 37:42.086
My dad said I couldn't talk to her

37:42.218 --> 37:45.085
after she supported McGovern
in our school's mock election.

37:45.221 --> 37:48.884
Just fun, I guess. I don't know.

37:51.019 --> 37:56.184
The Bird family has been kind enough
to open up their home to our cameras.

37:56.316 --> 37:58.932
I'm in Karen's room right now.

37:59.069 --> 38:00.730
I want to show you all
something we found

38:00.862 --> 38:03.023
while investigating
her record collection.

38:05.533 --> 38:08.149
NARRATOR: A poem Karen had written
on the inside sleeve

38:08.286 --> 38:12.529
of Karen Dalton's "In My Own Time "
was analyzed for clues.

38:15.627 --> 38:19.211
KAREN: Moonbeams and daydreams
and buttons and bows.

38:21.716 --> 38:24.833
Saltwater kisses
and hot sand between toes.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.884
My mom in her summer dress
and the smell of her hair.

38:39.943 --> 38:43.026
The sounds of July
and life without care.

39:20.025 --> 39:23.233
NARRATOR: Amid Jack and Karen's
honeymoon of bloodshed,

39:23.361 --> 39:25.602
the law was hot on their tail.

39:27.323 --> 39:31.783
They were traced to a motel
only seven hours from the reservation

39:31.911 --> 39:35.278
where they had signed into the guest
registrar with phony names.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.481
Having been informed that his client

40:07.614 --> 40:10.276
was on the precipice
of a nervous breakdown,

40:10.408 --> 40:12.649
Colonel Tom Parker flew to Los Angeles

40:12.786 --> 40:17.496
in hopes of interceding a mental
collapse and protecting investments.

40:24.839 --> 40:26.215
Hey.

40:29.427 --> 40:32.043
What did I tell you about sunglasses
where I can't see your eyes?

40:32.180 --> 40:34.296
- Take 'em off.
- Yes, Sir.

40:36.976 --> 40:41.185
Now, what's this I hear from Charlie
about you not hitting your notes?

40:43.775 --> 40:46.232
Tour starts in two days, Elvis.

40:48.113 --> 40:50.149
How is everything?

40:53.409 --> 40:55.491
Colonel, you remember when we first met?

40:55.620 --> 40:57.201
Of course.

40:59.374 --> 41:02.662
You told me I'd be the brightest star
ever did shine.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.534
Yes, I did.

41:05.713 --> 41:06.998
And I was.

41:07.132 --> 41:10.624
You are still the brightest star,
Elvis.

41:10.760 --> 41:13.422
No, Sir, I... lthink...

41:13.555 --> 41:17.343
What do they call them old dead stars
burned out a long time ago?

41:17.475 --> 41:22.390
Dwarfs. I'm like...
I'm like a dwarf star.

41:23.189 --> 41:25.180
What are you talking about?

41:27.193 --> 41:30.435
Sir, I'm talking about quitting.
Quitting the whole racket.

41:33.283 --> 41:37.492
Do you have any idea what kind of money
is tied up in this tour?

41:37.620 --> 41:40.578
Contracts, the tickets, the paychecks?

41:40.707 --> 41:43.414
Not to mention
that canceling such an event

41:43.543 --> 41:47.252
would cause an irreparable rift
between you and the public,

41:47.380 --> 41:49.996
and we don't need any more of that.

41:53.678 --> 41:55.794
Elvis, listen.

41:57.515 --> 42:03.385
Once this tour is through,
by all means, take some time off.

42:03.521 --> 42:06.729
That Lisa Marie, She ain't gonna be
a little girl forever.

42:09.903 --> 42:14.738
Mama came to see me in a dream.
Couple of nights back.

42:17.285 --> 42:20.948
I think She was trying to tell me
something but I don't understand what.

42:26.711 --> 42:29.578
Things just ain't the same
since she passed, sir.

42:30.590 --> 42:34.924
- That's when all this really started.
- All what started?

42:40.183 --> 42:42.094
Just all this sorrow.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.697
NIXON ON TV: ...thatl welcome
this kind of examination,

43:39.826 --> 43:43.444
because people have got to know whether
or not their president's a crook.

43:43.579 --> 43:47.788
Well, I'm not a crook.
I've earned everything I've got.

- What do you want?

44:43.097 --> 44:46.260
Well, Sir, I don't know if you remember
me but we met a few years back.

44:46.392 --> 44:50.226
Sioux Falls Elvis convention.
You gave me your address here

44:50.355 --> 44:52.971
and told me you might be able
to help me find Elvis.

44:54.192 --> 44:55.682
Yeah.

44:56.778 --> 45:01.112
Jack Blueblood.
We got Shithoused that night, didn't we?

45:01.240 --> 45:03.777
- Yeah, we certainly did, Sir.
- How are you, man?

45:03.910 --> 45:09.155
- Doing good. Do you mind if we come in?
- Yeah, you can all come in. Come on in.

45:09.290 --> 45:12.282
It's been a while Since
I've been on that convention circuit.

45:12.418 --> 45:15.205
I don't know,
been what, four or five years, Jack?

45:15.338 --> 45:18.296
Oh, that was... That was 1970, Sir.

45:18.424 --> 45:22.212
- Long time.
- Awful cool place you got here, man.

45:22.345 --> 45:26.008
Yeah, thank you.
My wife had a real eye for things.

45:27.058 --> 45:31.472
It's really all herjunk. Yeah.

45:32.438 --> 45:34.394
She's in a better place.

45:35.733 --> 45:39.191
So, what brings you out west?
Where y'all heading?

45:39.320 --> 45:41.857
Oh, we'rejust passing through
on our way to LA.

45:41.989 --> 45:44.651
Ooh! City of Angels.

45:44.784 --> 45:47.776
Who's this girl standing next to Elvis?

45:48.996 --> 45:53.740
Oh, yeah.
That would be Miss Dixie Locke.

45:53.876 --> 45:57.460
Yes.
That was ElviS'S high-school sweetheart.

45:57.588 --> 46:01.672
Mr X knew Elvis way back when, Karen.
Ain't that something?

46:01.801 --> 46:04.838
Yeah. Old, old friends.

46:04.971 --> 46:06.427
And where is She now?

46:06.556 --> 46:10.048
I don't know. Suppose
just another name in the phonebook.

46:11.269 --> 46:15.558
Just a footnote in the life story
of a boy that She loved when She was 16.

46:17.900 --> 46:22.985
Huh. I'm getting all sentimental.
Sorry about that.

46:25.908 --> 46:29.492
Let's talk Shop.
What can I do you for, Mr Jack?

46:29.620 --> 46:34.364
Well, I came here to get the name
of the hotel Elvis stays at in LA.

46:34.500 --> 46:36.240
(LAUGHS)

46:36.377 --> 46:39.744
AS well as his room number and whatever
name he uses for the reservation.

46:39.881 --> 46:42.964
Why would you need
that information, son?

46:43.092 --> 46:46.505
You told me a couple of years ago
I could buy that information off of you.

46:46.637 --> 46:49.754
80 bucks. That's what you told me
a few years back.

46:49.891 --> 46:52.382
Jack, we was laid out drunk.

I might have said a few things
that I really couldn't...

46:56.939 --> 46:59.772

I didn't drive out here

46:59.901 --> 47:02.893
in the middle of goddamn nowhere
to shoot the shit with you.

47:04.947 --> 47:06.608

49:20.625 --> 49:22.911
NARRATOR: That afternoon,
Karen felt a sensation in her gut

49:23.044 --> 49:25.456
she hadn't felt for a long time.

49:29.091 --> 49:32.879
She looked for familiar shapes
and faces in the desert clouds,

49:33.012 --> 49:35.048
but there were none to be found.

49:39.352 --> 49:41.764
At a truck stop in Mexican Hat, Utah,

49:41.896 --> 49:46.481
she stole from the book rack
a "Vixen" magazine for Jack,

49:46.609 --> 49:50.022
a "Total Teen " for Teijo,

49:50.154 --> 49:53.612
and a picture book
on Ancient Egypt for herself.

50:00.581 --> 50:04.165
On their long car ride
to the Grand Canyon,

50:04.293 --> 50:07.831
she wrote a short memoir about herself
in hieroglyphics.

50:09.215 --> 50:11.831
She didn't share it with Jack or Teijo,

50:11.967 --> 50:14.709
and when she arrived
at the Grand Canyon later that day

50:14.845 --> 50:16.961
she ripped it up into a million pieces

50:17.098 --> 50:21.717
and watched as her biography fell
to the bottom of the earth like snow.

50:37.493 --> 50:40.235
KAREN: Did you know the sun's gonna
burn out one day?

50:40.371 --> 50:43.863
- TEIJO: My God. Really?
- KAREN: True story.

50:43.999 --> 50:45.785
When?

50:45.918 --> 50:48.204
About five billion years, give or take.

50:49.463 --> 50:50.794
That's crazy.

50:50.923 --> 50:56.964
Yeah, once it runs out of hydrogen,
it'll become, like, a red giant,

50:57.096 --> 51:01.590
and then expand and swallow the Earth
and all the other planets.

51:01.726 --> 51:04.718
And then it'll explode and turn
into a black dwarf or something.

51:04.854 --> 51:07.220
Black dwarf? No, thank you.

51:08.357 --> 51:11.895
Yeah. It used to really scare me
when I was a little girl, but...

51:12.695 --> 51:15.402
Now five billion years
seems like an eternity.

51:25.666 --> 51:28.749
Teijo, can I tell you something?
You promise you won't tell anyone else?

51:28.878 --> 51:31.620
Oh, my God, secrets. Yes.

51:35.718 --> 51:37.424
I missed my monthlies.

51:39.889 --> 51:42.471
Well, when were you supposed to get 'em?

51:42.600 --> 51:47.344

You're an inspiration to someone like me
who doesn't have a lot of confidence.

52:22.973 --> 52:24.929
No, that's not true, Teijo.

52:26.185 --> 52:27.300
It is.

52:30.564 --> 52:31.974
It is.

52:38.531 --> 52:42.115

You don't need to worry anymore, Teijo.

it made me realize Elvis is real.

58:00.978 --> 58:04.470
He's got blood in his veins
and love in his heartjust like us.

58:04.606 --> 58:09.225
Thank you, Karen. I know that.

58:09.361 --> 58:12.899
I think the law will let you off easy
for killing Sanborn.

Well, he treated you wrong your
whole life and he got what was coming.

58:23.584 --> 58:25.165
But Elvis is an innocent man.

58:25.294 --> 58:29.207
Karen, there ain't nobody
that's innocent. All right?

58:29.339 --> 58:30.795
Jack, you love Elvis.

58:30.924 --> 58:33.301
- That man is a fucking phony!

1:09:37.006 --> 1:09:39.668
and more inspiring than
Karen had ever imagined.

1:09:39.801 --> 1:09:43.385
Looking upon it,
she thought of all the countless waves

1:09:43.513 --> 1:09:45.970
which had crashed along the beach
throughout history.

1:09:46.099 --> 1:09:50.468

for herself, and for Elvis,

it all became clear to Jack.

This was the man who sang "That's All
Right" and "Blue Moon of Kentucky"

1:16:00.932 --> 1:16:04.971
and "Mystery Train. "
This was his hero.

1:16:05.102 --> 1:16:09.061
It was a voice that had gotten him
through many lonely nights.

1:16:09.190 --> 1:16:12.353
This was Elvis Aaron Presley.

1:16:12.485 --> 1:16:14.396
They were dream brothers,

1:16:14.528 --> 1:16:18.441
and they were connected
by some inextricable cosmic force.

1:16:23.454 --> 1:16:26.196
And then Jack died.

from the Beverly Canyon Hotel,

1:16:45.977 --> 1:16:48.684
where there has been
an assassination attempt on Elvis.

1:16:48.813 --> 1:16:50.519
Elvis's unidentified assailant

1:16:50.648 --> 1:16:53.856
was shot down by one of
the Memphis Mafia, Judd Feathers,

1:16:53.985 --> 1:16:57.102
who we're hearing died soon after
by wounds sustained to his chest.

tonight's show to him.

NARRATOR: The whole thing
was covered up by RCA and the Colonel,

1:17:13.671 --> 1:17:15.832
who feared that the incident
might tarnish

1:17:15.965 --> 1:17:19.583
Elvis's already tenuous relationship
with the public and his fans.

1:17:19.719 --> 1:17:23.428
The incident lives on
in Elvis's can of urban legends,

1:17:23.556 --> 1:17:26.343
along with his supposed abduction
by aliens

Elvis played to the Los Angeles crowd
that evening like he was 18.

1:18:43.010 --> 1:18:45.752
He had found his Shangri-La.

1:18:45.888 --> 1:18:50.803
He had found salvation.
He had found the righteous path.

1:18:52.728 --> 1:18:54.593
And so had Jack.

1:18:58.859 --> 1:19:04.149
As for Karen, some say her car slid off
the highway and into the ocean,

1:19:04.281 --> 1:19:08.900
where she's still trapped underwater,
entombed by the sea.

1:19:09.036 --> 1:19:13.245
Others speculate she moved to Canada,
gave birth to Jack's child,

1:19:13.374 --> 1:19:18.164
and became what she ran away from
in the first place, her mother.

1:19:20.589 --> 1:19:23.877
The most popular story
is that she changed her name,

1:19:24.009 --> 1:19:27.467
laid low for a few years
and re-emerged a decade later

1:19:27.596 --> 1:19:33.341
as recording artist Jennifer Fever,
whose minor 1988 hit "Shangri-La Suite "

1:19:33.477 --> 1:19:36.969
was said to have been about
her brief affair with Jack Blueblood.

1:19:38.315 --> 1:19:41.728
As far as the evidence is concerned,
she was last seen

1:19:41.861 --> 1:19:45.399
entering a gas-station bathroom
in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

1:19:46.365 --> 1:19:49.277
Billy Freehall,
a transient male prostitute

1:19:49.410 --> 1:19:51.401
and the last person to see her alive,

1:19:51.537 --> 1:19:54.825
claimed he would never forget
the look on her face.

1:19:54.957 --> 1:19:57.824
A mixture of freedom and despair.

1:19:57.960 --> 1:20:01.293
It would stay with him
for the rest of his short life.

1:20:37.124 --> 1:20:40.833
Sure, the sun would burn out one day

1:20:40.961 --> 1:20:44.419
but that wasn't
for a very, very long time.

1:20:44.548 --> 1:20:47.836
The future was an endless highway,

1:20:47.968 --> 1:20:52.337
and Karen would follow the sun
until its end.
