( <i>Salem grunting</i> )

00:04.605 --> 00:06.840
Oh, good, I caught you.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.743
( <i>sniffing</i> ):
Do I smell poi?

00:09.743 --> 00:12.713
I'm making some Hawaiian
munchies for our luau tonight.

00:12.713 --> 00:13.647
Tonight?

00:13.647 --> 00:16.216
Sabrina, it's the Other
Realm Independence Weekend.

00:16.216 --> 00:18.218
Hilda and Zelda already left.

00:18.218 --> 00:19.219
I'm not going.

00:19.219 --> 00:20.454
I'm tired of the crowds

00:20.454 --> 00:22.856
the exploding quasars are
the same every year

00:22.856 --> 00:25.292
and there's always a traffic jam
at the event horizon.

00:25.292 --> 00:28.128
But I need you to film
the fireworks for me.

00:28.128 --> 00:31.231
I'd do it myself if I weren't
<i>cata</i> <i>non grata.</i>

00:31.231 --> 00:32.533
I'm sorry, Salem.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.501
My roommates and I have
organized the whole thing.

00:34.501 --> 00:36.069
I mean we even put
a down payment on a pig.

00:36.069 --> 00:37.704
And once you've ordered
a pig together

00:37.704 --> 00:38.805
there's no turning back.

00:38.805 --> 00:41.675
Well, if this dumb luau
is so important

00:41.675 --> 00:43.710
how about I stick around
and film it for you?

00:43.710 --> 00:47.147
My new minicam can do all sorts
of effects.

00:47.147 --> 00:48.582
Well, so can I.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.117
Um, do you prefer

00:50.117 --> 00:53.153
a dissolve, a swish pan,
or a smash cut?

00:53.153 --> 00:54.721
You wouldn't.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.124
How about the classic...
fade out.

00:57.124 --> 00:58.926
Very funny.

02:08.822 --> 02:12.392
No, I've never bought
pooka shells before.

02:12.392 --> 02:15.128
Fine, I'll help you shuck
the pookas.

02:16.263 --> 02:17.297
Oh, my God.

02:17.297 --> 02:19.232
The-the microwave.

02:19.232 --> 02:20.700
What about it?

02:20.700 --> 02:22.736
It was floating.

02:22.903 --> 02:23.870
Really?

02:23.870 --> 02:26.539
I didn't know it came
with that option.

02:26.539 --> 02:28.608
No indication of a power surge.

02:28.608 --> 02:29.943
The cord looks fine.

02:29.943 --> 02:31.411
How can a microwave float?

02:31.411 --> 02:33.113
More importantly,
how could it cook a whole salmon

02:33.113 --> 02:34.114
in under ten seconds?

02:34.114 --> 02:35.782
These things are wild.

02:35.782 --> 02:36.917
I'm serious, Sabrina.

02:36.917 --> 02:39.352
We just experienced a
supernatural phenomenon

02:39.352 --> 02:41.554
for which we have
no logical explanation.

02:41.554 --> 02:43.390
Maybe we have a ghost.

02:43.390 --> 02:44.557
A ghost?

02:44.557 --> 02:45.592
Wow.

02:45.592 --> 02:47.294
I've always wanted
to hunt a ghost.

02:47.294 --> 02:50.030
You know I hear they're easy
to bag, but hard to strap to the
hood.

02:50.030 --> 02:50.864
Finally.

02:50.864 --> 02:55.402
My chance to go mano-a-mano
with a supernatural being.

02:55.402 --> 02:57.470

can frighten a ghost, it's you!

surprisingly comfortable.

Oh, Josh!

03:19.159 --> 03:20.827
This is a surprise.

03:20.827 --> 03:23.463
I'm so glad you could make it.

03:23.463 --> 03:25.966
Hey, roast a pig
and I'm there.

03:28.401 --> 03:29.803
Sabrina.

03:29.803 --> 03:31.972
What is my ex-boyfriend
doing here?

03:31.972 --> 03:33.106
Um, he's my friend

03:33.106 --> 03:36.409
and, besides, you
said it was okay.

03:36.409 --> 03:39.379
I must have been tweezing
or waxing at the time.

03:39.379 --> 03:41.748
You know that
you can't talk to me then.

03:42.549 --> 03:43.883
Hi. Who are you?

03:43.883 --> 03:45.218
What do you mean by that?

03:45.218 --> 03:47.320
Let me put this another way--
who invited you?

03:47.320 --> 03:48.154
Stop grilling me.

03:48.154 --> 03:49.889
What are you, the C.I.A-A-A?

03:49.889 --> 03:52.258
Miles,
your friend is here!

03:52.258 --> 03:53.526
Garth, you made it.

03:53.526 --> 03:55.028
Sabrina,
this is Garth.

03:55.028 --> 03:57.163
Hey, nice to meet you.

03:57.163 --> 03:58.932
What's in the bag?

03:59.566 --> 04:01.534
It's an Ectoplex 5000
energy detector.

04:01.534 --> 04:02.635
( <i>giggles</i> )

04:02.635 --> 04:04.604
Wow. Can it detect
when we're out of dip?

04:04.904 --> 04:06.406
I don't know. I'll check.

04:06.406 --> 04:07.607
That was a joke.

04:07.607 --> 04:09.075
Oh.

04:10.343 --> 04:11.378
After the flying
microwave incident

04:11.378 --> 04:12.946
I asked
for Garth's help.

04:12.946 --> 04:16.249
The Ectoplex zeros in
on paranormal energy fields

04:16.249 --> 04:17.751
and supernatural
phenomenon.

04:17.751 --> 04:19.185
Well, that
dovetails nicely

04:19.185 --> 04:20.820
with the whole
Hawaiian theme.

04:20.820 --> 04:22.055
It will solve the mystery

04:22.055 --> 04:23.490
of what's going on
in this house.

04:23.490 --> 04:25.025
Find out if there are any...

04:25.025 --> 04:27.160
poltergeists, witches,
extra-terrestrials--

04:27.160 --> 04:28.828
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Witches?

04:28.828 --> 04:33.466
Yeah. It's just two clicks up
the dial from Doppelganger.

04:33.466 --> 04:37.303
There is definitely something
not normal in this house.

04:37.303 --> 04:38.605
You think?

04:39.239 --> 04:41.408
I got to go
strain my poi.

04:43.043 --> 04:43.777
( <i>sighs</i> )

04:43.777 --> 04:46.679
What a fantastic evening.

04:46.679 --> 04:48.748
There is nothing
better for the ego

04:48.748 --> 04:54.621
than seeing your ex-boyfriend
tripping over his grass skirt.

04:54.621 --> 04:56.656
I can't believe
nobody touched my poi.

04:56.656 --> 04:59.926
Although, my coconuts
were a big hit.

04:59.926 --> 05:02.429
Okay, I've checked all the
bedrooms and the closets--

05:02.429 --> 05:03.596
and Morgan, while you do have

05:03.596 --> 05:05.865
an interesting
selection of hosiery

05:05.865 --> 05:07.934
I detect
no supernatural activity.

05:07.934 --> 05:09.803
You went looking
for poltergeists

05:09.803 --> 05:11.137
in my underwear drawer?

05:11.137 --> 05:12.505
For your
own protection.

05:12.505 --> 05:13.840
Okay, playtime's over.

05:13.840 --> 05:15.775
Put down the toy
and start drying.

05:16.443 --> 05:19.446
Oh, major paranormal
activity in the kitchen.

05:19.446 --> 05:21.047
Oh, come on, Miles.

05:21.047 --> 05:24.451
That's just a black
Frisbee on a stick.

05:25.118 --> 05:26.886
The thing obviously
doesn't work right.

05:26.886 --> 05:28.521
I mean, look, it's
gone haywire.

05:28.521 --> 05:29.789
Well that's because according
to the gauge

05:29.789 --> 05:31.758
it's closer to the source
of the abnormality.

05:31.758 --> 05:34.494
There is nothing
abnormal about Sabrina.

05:34.494 --> 05:35.628
Point it at Roxie.

05:35.628 --> 05:38.798
Maybe Morgan's the
one who's not normal.

05:39.165 --> 05:41.000
I'm getting nothing
from you either.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.036
Oh, trust me, you never will.

05:45.038 --> 05:46.773
This is creepy.

05:46.773 --> 05:48.041
Okay.

05:48.041 --> 05:50.009
You know what, Miles,
if you turn it off

05:50.009 --> 05:51.911
I'll explain everything.

05:53.146 --> 05:53.646
I don't know how

05:53.646 --> 05:55.281
to tell you guys this, but...

05:55.281 --> 05:57.650
I'm... psychic.

05:57.650 --> 05:58.785
Are you kidding?

05:58.785 --> 06:00.653
Half the time you can't
find your own keys.

06:00.653 --> 06:02.755
This has nothing to do
with being psychic.

06:02.755 --> 06:04.357
There is
a supernatural presence here

06:04.357 --> 06:07.894
and I'm guessing it needs
a human host to survive.

06:07.894 --> 06:10.163
Or... in your case, hostess.

06:10.163 --> 06:11.197
So what
are you saying?

06:11.197 --> 06:13.900
That, that there's
some paranormal parasite

06:13.900 --> 06:15.435
leeching off
Sabrina?

06:15.435 --> 06:17.137
Exactly.
But don't worry, Sabrina.

06:17.137 --> 06:18.972
Whatever this
other-worldly thing is

06:18.972 --> 06:20.840
I'm going to expose it,
annihilate it

06:20.840 --> 06:24.077
and blast it out
of this house forever.

06:24.077 --> 06:25.378
That's so sweet.

06:25.378 --> 06:26.713
Um, but you know

06:26.713 --> 06:29.315
don't go to any trouble
on my account.

06:31.184 --> 06:33.686
Salem, I'm in serious trouble.

06:33.686 --> 06:36.222
Miles got his hands on some
paranormal energy detector

06:36.222 --> 06:37.524
and keeps
pointing it at me.

06:37.524 --> 06:38.858
Relax.

06:38.858 --> 06:40.627
Most of those
detectors are a joke.

06:40.627 --> 06:42.428
There's only one
that really works.

06:42.428 --> 06:43.897
The Ectoplex 5000?

06:43.897 --> 06:45.098
That's the one.

06:45.398 --> 06:46.633
It keeps
going berserk around me.

06:46.633 --> 06:47.700
What am I going to do?

06:47.700 --> 06:50.069
I mean, besides
get exposed and vaporized.

06:50.069 --> 06:52.705
Mmm, I knew this day would come.

06:52.705 --> 06:55.375
Sabrina, it's time for the talk.

06:55.375 --> 06:58.578
Most girls get it from their
mothers, I get it from the cat.

06:58.578 --> 07:00.280
Mortals with Ectoplex machines

07:00.280 --> 07:02.148
are only interested
in one thing.

07:02.148 --> 07:03.716
You need to use protection.

07:03.716 --> 07:04.951
Protection?

07:04.951 --> 07:07.287
An Anti-Detection Force Field.

07:07.287 --> 07:09.622
You can get it at the Other
Realm drugstore, aisle seven

07:09.622 --> 07:12.358
and don't let
the clerk intimidate you.

07:14.527 --> 07:16.129
Okay.

07:16.329 --> 07:19.365
Got my Anti-Detection
Force Field.

07:22.502 --> 07:24.370
"To remove childproof cap,
line up arrows

07:24.370 --> 07:26.606
squeeze, twist,
push down and... "

07:26.606 --> 07:28.775
I knew I should've
gotten the roll-on.

07:31.010 --> 07:32.579
Here goes.

07:35.481 --> 07:37.483
Ooh. Tingly.

07:37.483 --> 07:40.486
All right, now it's time
to give that Ectoplex a flex.

07:45.491 --> 07:46.826
Okay.

07:46.826 --> 07:49.996
If I were a paranoid
conspiracy nut hunting a ghost

07:49.996 --> 07:52.999
where would I hide my detector?

07:54.601 --> 07:55.735
Bingo.

07:57.070 --> 07:59.105
Ah, this force field is perfect.

07:59.105 --> 08:02.475
"From paranormal to normal
in just one easy spritz."

08:02.475 --> 08:06.613
Woo-hoo!

08:15.388 --> 08:17.924
Hey, looks like we got
a squatter in the ceiling.

08:18.057 --> 08:19.092
Put that thing down.

08:19.092 --> 08:20.059
Who said that?

08:20.059 --> 08:22.929
You're not scaring me.

08:22.929 --> 08:24.130
All right, maybe just a little.

08:24.130 --> 08:25.632
-Boo!
-All right, a lot!

08:25.632 --> 08:27.133
Who are you and what are you
doing in my living room?

08:27.133 --> 08:28.301
Your living room?

08:28.301 --> 08:29.936
I lived in this house
for 30 years

08:29.936 --> 08:31.704
and I've been here
for 40.

08:31.704 --> 08:33.373
So that would make you...

08:33.373 --> 08:36.609
Dead... but still a live wire.

08:36.709 --> 08:39.245
So, you're a ghost.

08:39.245 --> 08:41.714
Ex... cuse me.

08:41.714 --> 08:44.717
I find that uncomfortable.

08:44.717 --> 08:45.652
Sorry.

08:45.652 --> 08:46.853
You should be.

08:46.853 --> 08:49.555
If you hadn't used
your stupid magic

08:49.555 --> 08:51.491
nobody would have been
looking for spirits.

08:51.491 --> 08:52.425
I could still be
floating around

08:52.425 --> 08:54.527
in my underwear
watching a Celtics game.

08:54.527 --> 08:56.496
Ew.

08:56.496 --> 08:57.597
Look, how was I
supposed to know

08:57.597 --> 08:58.431
there was a ghost here?

08:58.431 --> 08:59.699
It's not like
the housing ad said

08:59.699 --> 09:01.467
"Three, plus
two-and-a-half, plus ghost."

09:01.467 --> 09:04.404
All I know is, your friends
want to take somebody down

09:04.404 --> 09:06.205
and there's not enough room here
for both of us

09:06.205 --> 09:07.940
so mark my words, Missy.

09:07.940 --> 09:10.276
If anyone gets blasted
out of here, it's you.

09:10.843 --> 09:13.813
Whatever happened to the concept
of the friendly ghost?

09:13.813 --> 09:15.481
Urban legend!

09:21.913 --> 09:23.981
Listen up
and listen good, ghost.

09:23.981 --> 09:25.416
I can't get blasted
out of here.

09:25.416 --> 09:28.586
All right, this is the only
good housing left near campus.

09:28.953 --> 09:29.720
Wait a minute.

09:29.720 --> 09:30.988
What am I worried about?

09:30.988 --> 09:33.291
I have a force field
and roommates that like me.

09:33.758 --> 09:34.292
Hey, guys.

09:34.292 --> 09:35.359
Oh, you're here.

09:35.359 --> 09:37.094
We were
just leaving.

09:37.094 --> 09:37.962
No, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.

09:37.962 --> 09:38.596
You don't have to go.

09:38.596 --> 09:39.797
Look, everything's fine.

09:39.797 --> 09:42.400
Whatever was making this machine
go off before, is gone.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.002
Look. See? Huh?
Nothing.

09:45.002 --> 09:47.104
Oh, thank goodness.

09:48.139 --> 09:49.440
Oh, I guess I should
call that breeder

09:49.440 --> 09:50.608
and cancel
the Doberman.

09:50.608 --> 09:53.010
And I can stop sleeping
with garlic and a cross.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.679
Here, you got mail.

09:57.348 --> 09:59.383
Oh, what are you doing?

09:59.383 --> 10:02.453
Uh, I'm getting into improv.

10:02.453 --> 10:03.454
I'm going to start
a one-woman show.

10:03.454 --> 10:07.158
I'm going to call it, um,
Insane Person Opens Mail.

10:08.593 --> 10:12.296
Oh, I get the
"insane" part.

10:12.730 --> 10:14.332
What's with you,
Spellman?

10:14.332 --> 10:15.366
Nothing.

10:15.366 --> 10:17.802
I'm, uh, I'm just going
to put this over here

10:17.802 --> 10:19.737
for, um, for safekeeping.

10:20.871 --> 10:24.075
Uh, you know what,
I, I... need a soda.

10:27.178 --> 10:30.348
On second thought, you know,
water sounds really good.

10:30.348 --> 10:32.883
I can't believe I'm going
to say this, but Miles is right.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.986
There is something very weird
going on with you.

10:34.986 --> 10:37.188
No, no, no, it's not.

10:37.188 --> 10:37.989
Who are you
going to believe?

10:37.989 --> 10:39.323
What? A kook
like Miles

10:39.323 --> 10:41.626
or the most level-headed
person in this house?

10:43.527 --> 10:47.231
Never buy conditioner
at a garage sale.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.169
"Paranormal Extermination."

10:52.169 --> 10:54.372
Here's one-- "Gary's
Unwanted Energy Removal.

10:54.372 --> 10:58.276
Licensed and bonded
in both realms." Perfect.

10:58.276 --> 10:59.210
Gary at your service.

10:59.210 --> 11:00.411
What seems to be
the phenomenon?

11:00.411 --> 11:02.079
Got a ghost, Gary,
and if I don't
get rid of him

11:02.079 --> 11:03.080
I'll be thrown
out of this house

11:03.080 --> 11:05.116
and lose the best
friends I've ever had.

11:05.116 --> 11:06.951
( <i>electronic beeping</i> )
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

11:06.951 --> 11:09.287
You definitely
got yourself a ghost.

11:09.287 --> 11:10.988
But don't worry,
you're in good hands with Gary.

11:10.988 --> 11:12.189
At least you will be
when I come back

11:12.189 --> 11:13.457
first thing Monday morning.

11:13.457 --> 11:14.825
Whoa, what are you
talking about?

11:14.825 --> 11:16.027
I need an exterminator now.

11:16.027 --> 11:17.228
I'd love to help you out

11:17.228 --> 11:19.130
but it's Other Realm
Independence Weekend.

11:19.130 --> 11:19.897
Fireworks start in two hours.

11:19.897 --> 11:21.532
Family's waiting for me.

11:21.532 --> 11:23.067
It's Little Gary's
first big bang.

11:23.067 --> 11:24.101
Forget about
Little Gary.

11:24.101 --> 11:25.102
What about me?

11:25.102 --> 11:26.337
All right, okay, okay.

11:26.337 --> 11:28.639
Uh, here's
what I can do for you.

11:28.639 --> 11:30.941
A kazoo? How's this
going to help me
get rid of a ghost?

11:30.941 --> 11:31.676
It won't.

11:31.676 --> 11:32.543
But you know,
I've always found

11:32.543 --> 11:33.411
that in stressful times

11:33.411 --> 11:36.113
funny music
can be very therapeutic.

11:37.615 --> 11:41.385
( <i>playing kazoo</i> )

11:41.385 --> 11:43.854
Hey, he's right--
this is kind of soothing.

11:49.593 --> 11:52.129
Obviously you're not a big fan
of funny music.

11:52.229 --> 11:55.499
Hey, Sabrina.

11:55.499 --> 11:57.601
Hey, guys, what's that?

11:57.601 --> 11:58.636
Your salvation.

11:58.636 --> 12:01.339
That's is the EXT
Paranormal Ion
Eliminator.

12:01.339 --> 12:02.907
With turbo.

12:02.907 --> 12:03.641
Lock and load.

12:03.641 --> 12:05.176
Whatever's living inside you

12:05.176 --> 12:06.877
is going to be blasted
to smithereens.

12:06.877 --> 12:07.745
According
to the manual

12:07.745 --> 12:09.046
you may feel
a slight pinch.

12:09.046 --> 12:11.582
Oh, well, you know,
as-as much as I want to be saved

12:11.582 --> 12:13.918
I-I think I could wait
until Monday.

12:13.918 --> 12:16.120
It'll only take a second.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.755
( <i>popping</i> )

12:19.724 --> 12:21.459
She blew up the
Ion Eliminator.

12:21.459 --> 12:23.160
What kind of all-powerful,
supernatural force

12:23.160 --> 12:26.097
are we dealing with?

12:26.097 --> 12:28.232
One that can give us
a nice tan.

12:28.232 --> 12:31.001
Sabrina, you're brighter
than a Kuwaiti refinery.

12:31.001 --> 12:34.071
But I don't want you
to panic; that's my job.

12:34.071 --> 12:35.106
Let's get out of here.

12:35.673 --> 12:37.775
I think I feel that pinch
you were talking about.

12:37.775 --> 12:39.744
GHOST:
That was me.

12:39.744 --> 12:42.146
And now they're afraid of me,
and I don't know what to do.

12:42.146 --> 12:43.914
Are you even listening to me,
Salem?

12:43.914 --> 12:45.916
You're talking on
the phone to your cat?

12:45.916 --> 12:48.152
No. It's my Uncle Salem.

12:48.152 --> 12:50.488
Give my best to Aunt Newport.

12:51.255 --> 12:52.123
What are you wearing?

12:52.123 --> 12:53.224
Anti-contamination gear.

12:53.224 --> 12:54.859
We felt the situation
warranted it.

12:54.859 --> 12:55.826
We?

12:55.826 --> 12:57.661
Aren't they darling?

12:57.661 --> 12:59.029
Oh, yeah,
they're real cute.

12:59.029 --> 12:59.997
Stand back.

12:59.997 --> 13:02.967
These suits are guaranteed
against nuclear spills, not you.

13:02.967 --> 13:04.034
Okay, this is ridiculous.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.003
I am the same Sabrina
I always was.

13:06.003 --> 13:08.305
Your roommate, your friend...

13:08.305 --> 13:09.640
We've pulled all-nighters
together.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.275
We just had a luau, remember?

13:11.275 --> 13:12.810
I made the poi

13:12.810 --> 13:14.178
Miles, you peeled the papayas

13:14.178 --> 13:15.746
Roxie, you filleted the pig

13:15.746 --> 13:18.649
Morgan... you supervised.

13:18.649 --> 13:20.050
We're friends
with Sabrina

13:20.050 --> 13:22.386
not the evil spirit
that dwells within her.

13:22.386 --> 13:22.987
So, what's the deal?

13:22.987 --> 13:24.722
Are you some kind
of goblin thingy

13:24.722 --> 13:27.458
or an alien life form
trying to colonize earth?

13:27.458 --> 13:29.593
Is that why you lent me
your red sweater--

13:29.593 --> 13:31.962
to collect my human DNA?

13:31.962 --> 13:34.031
I never lent you my red sweater.

13:34.031 --> 13:36.567
I withdraw the question.

13:36.567 --> 13:37.568
What are you guys
going to do--

13:37.568 --> 13:39.370
wear those suits
whenever you're around me?

13:39.370 --> 13:41.205
This is only
a stopgap measure.

13:41.205 --> 13:42.640
Until your
cage arrives.

13:42.640 --> 13:43.641
What cage?

13:43.641 --> 13:44.742
The one
that will hold you

13:44.742 --> 13:46.110
until your bubble's
been built.

13:46.110 --> 13:47.478
I'm not living
in a bubble.

13:47.478 --> 13:48.479
Yet.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.147
In the meantime,
I've contacted

13:50.147 --> 13:51.615
a prominent
paranormal researcher

13:51.615 --> 13:53.451
who's interested
in meeting you...

13:53.451 --> 13:55.820
and perhaps
dissecting you.

13:55.820 --> 13:57.288
I'm not a frog.

13:57.288 --> 13:58.789
Can you prove that?

13:58.789 --> 14:00.090
Okay, you know what?

14:00.090 --> 14:00.791
You guys don't
have to worry

14:00.791 --> 14:02.426
about being
contaminated anymore.

14:02.426 --> 14:04.161
I think it would be
better for all of us

14:04.161 --> 14:07.431
if I just moved back
in with my aunts.

14:10.367 --> 14:13.070
We still get
to keep the outfits, right?

14:16.173 --> 14:18.909
Hey, Sabrina,
that luau rocked.

14:18.909 --> 14:20.511
I'll tell you,
there's nothing
better for the ego

14:20.511 --> 14:22.213
than seeing your ex-
girlfriend jealous

14:22.213 --> 14:24.081
at how great you
look in a grass skirt.

14:24.081 --> 14:25.082
That's nice, Josh.

14:25.082 --> 14:25.850
What's wrong?

14:25.850 --> 14:27.251
You don't seem
like yourself today.

14:27.251 --> 14:29.119
Well, you're not the first
person to say that.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.421
Anything you want
to talk about?

14:30.421 --> 14:31.555
Oh, it wouldn't do
any good.

14:31.555 --> 14:32.890
There's somebody
living in my house

14:32.890 --> 14:34.692
that says it's not big enough
for both of us.

14:34.692 --> 14:36.126
Ooh, I hear you.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.895
Morgan can be
really selfish.

14:37.895 --> 14:38.529
It's not Morgan.

14:38.529 --> 14:39.463
And who it is
doesn't matter.

14:39.463 --> 14:41.732
The point is if I don't figure
out a way to deal with this

14:41.732 --> 14:43.767
I may never live
in that house again.

14:44.201 --> 14:46.437
Well, Roxie is a
tough nut to crack.

14:46.437 --> 14:48.939
Why don't you just sit her down
and have a heart-to-heart?

14:48.939 --> 14:49.940
It's not Roxie.

14:49.940 --> 14:50.941
And I have a feeling

14:50.941 --> 14:52.109
that the person I
have a problem with

14:52.109 --> 14:53.511
really isn't into
heart-to-hearts.

14:53.511 --> 14:55.980
I think if the two of you
could just discuss your feelings

14:55.980 --> 14:58.282
I'm sure you can come to
an understanding with Miles.

14:58.282 --> 14:59.450
Would you stop guessing?

14:59.450 --> 15:00.451
I have to stop.

15:00.451 --> 15:01.619
I just ran out of roommates.

15:01.619 --> 15:04.188
Well, this person
is impossible.

15:04.188 --> 15:05.256
I tried to work it out

15:05.256 --> 15:07.625
but there's so
much hostility
I'm dealing with.

15:07.625 --> 15:10.261
I'm not a psychologist,
but anybody that angry

15:10.261 --> 15:12.296
probably has
unresolved issues.

15:12.296 --> 15:13.797
Huh. Unresolved issues.

15:13.797 --> 15:14.999
There's a thought.

15:14.999 --> 15:16.133
Thanks, Josh.

15:16.133 --> 15:17.601
Hey, just tell me
one more thing.

15:17.601 --> 15:19.470
Is this new roommate
male or female?

15:19.470 --> 15:22.406
Uh, well, he
used to be male.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.809
He's got a lot
of unresolved issues.

15:36.620 --> 15:39.957
Okay, Mr. Ghost,
we need to talk.

15:39.957 --> 15:41.592
I'm indisposed.

15:41.592 --> 15:43.961
And the name is Marv.

15:43.961 --> 15:44.995
Well, when you've finished up

15:44.995 --> 15:46.263
I'd like to have
a word with you.

15:47.364 --> 15:47.998
What do you want?

15:48.232 --> 15:50.434
Marv, uh, you know,
I don't mean to sound critical

15:50.434 --> 15:52.102
but you seem to have
a lot of pent up frustration.

15:52.102 --> 15:53.637
And I'm just wondering,
what happened

15:53.637 --> 15:54.872
to make you so hostile?

15:54.872 --> 16:00.511
Well, if you must
know... I lost my wife.

16:00.511 --> 16:01.412
I'm sorry.

16:01.412 --> 16:02.613
She died?

16:02.613 --> 16:04.214
No, I died, stupid.

16:04.214 --> 16:05.983
Keep up.

16:05.983 --> 16:07.785
Oh, so she's still alive.

16:07.785 --> 16:10.154
Yes.

16:10.154 --> 16:12.723
That's why I keep
hanging around here

16:12.723 --> 16:13.958
hoping that Betty
will get nostalgic

16:13.958 --> 16:17.494
for our life together,
and come back.

16:17.494 --> 16:18.228
So that's all you want?

16:18.228 --> 16:19.330
To see your wife again?

16:19.330 --> 16:21.966
Oh, yes. And to give her
the present I made for her.

16:21.966 --> 16:25.703
It's been collecting dust up
in the attic for ten years.

16:25.703 --> 16:26.971
Let me ask you something.

16:26.971 --> 16:29.340
What if I found Betty,
brought her here

16:29.340 --> 16:30.808
and gave her your gift?

16:30.808 --> 16:32.710
I'd be eternally grateful.

16:32.710 --> 16:34.645
Grateful enough
to leave this place forever?

16:34.645 --> 16:39.450
Yes. The paranoid kid with
the ukulele is driving me crazy.

16:42.052 --> 16:44.421
I'll bet this house
brings back memories for you.

16:44.421 --> 16:45.623
What a dump.

16:45.623 --> 16:47.091
Well, we find it quaint.

16:47.091 --> 16:49.660
I mean, sure, the molding's
crooked, the windows stick

16:49.660 --> 16:51.795
and, you know, there's
a few leaky fixtures.

16:51.795 --> 16:52.896
That's Marv for you.

16:52.896 --> 16:55.065
Thought he could
fix everything himself.

16:55.065 --> 16:56.133
He was all thumbs.

16:56.133 --> 16:58.135
Oh, but what gifted thumbs
they were.

16:58.135 --> 16:59.069
And look what he built

16:59.069 --> 17:00.270
with those
little chubby things.

17:00.270 --> 17:03.273
I found this in the attic
and I think it belongs to you.

17:03.273 --> 17:05.009
Looks like Marv's
handiwork--

17:05.009 --> 17:08.612
painstakingly crafted with
popsicle sticks and gum.

17:08.612 --> 17:09.913
Well, you know,
it's not easy

17:09.913 --> 17:11.849
to make a jewelry box
with no right angles.

17:11.849 --> 17:13.450
Plus, it's the thought
that counts.

17:13.450 --> 17:14.752
What in the world?

17:14.752 --> 17:18.489
20,000 shares of the
Microsoft Corporation.

17:18.489 --> 17:20.324
Are they the
baby powder people?

17:20.324 --> 17:23.327
They're the people
that just made you rich.

17:23.327 --> 17:24.795
I can't believe it.

17:24.795 --> 17:27.998
Marv never picked
a winner the whole
time we were married.

17:27.998 --> 17:28.999
He picked you.

17:28.999 --> 17:30.134
Oh, thanks, doll.

17:30.134 --> 17:30.701
But don't think
you're getting

17:30.701 --> 17:33.771
your hands on
any of my money.

17:33.771 --> 17:37.841
All right, well, it was nice
meeting you too, Betty.

17:37.841 --> 17:40.611
Now I know
why he loved you so much.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.815
Thank you, Sabrina.

17:44.815 --> 17:45.983
I can't tell you
how good it was

17:45.983 --> 17:47.518
to see her again.

17:47.518 --> 17:49.753
Isn't she an angel?

17:49.753 --> 17:51.388
Okay.

17:52.089 --> 17:55.125
Oh, well, a deal's a deal.

17:55.125 --> 17:56.493
I guess I'll be moving on.

17:56.493 --> 17:57.695
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

17:57.695 --> 17:59.663
I need you to help me fix things
with my roommates.

17:59.663 --> 18:02.232
I mean, they think I'm
some sort of supernatural freak.

18:02.232 --> 18:05.235
Right. I have an idea.

18:05.235 --> 18:08.138
What if they all have
supernatural powers?

18:08.138 --> 18:10.607
Then we could write
a comic book about them.

18:10.874 --> 18:13.077
Oh, the living.

18:13.077 --> 18:15.345
You guys kill me.

18:15.345 --> 18:16.080
( <i>laughing</i> )

18:16.480 --> 18:18.248
All right,
everybody's home.

18:18.248 --> 18:20.150
You ready
to wreak some havoc?

18:20.150 --> 18:21.752
My specialty.

18:24.922 --> 18:27.091
I miss Sabrina.

18:27.091 --> 18:29.993
But it is nice to have
the house back to normal.

18:29.993 --> 18:32.596
Anyone want
to split a pig salad sandwich?

18:34.331 --> 18:36.333
I take back what I said
about normal.

18:36.333 --> 18:37.735
Roxie, don't move.

18:37.735 --> 18:39.937
I'm the only one
in the kitchen, right?

18:39.937 --> 18:43.373
Hey, yeah, except for
that spirit possessing you.

18:43.507 --> 18:46.110
Hey, I, I was going
to win that game.

18:46.110 --> 18:48.479
Looks like
you're possessed, too.

18:48.479 --> 18:50.681
All you women are
freaks of nature.

18:50.681 --> 18:52.049
I knew it.

18:52.449 --> 18:54.518
And I like it.

18:58.222 --> 19:00.257
This is not good.

19:03.894 --> 19:05.996
I have a very
sensitive inner ear.

19:08.031 --> 19:09.600
Well, looks like

19:09.600 --> 19:10.868
my work here is done.

19:10.868 --> 19:12.870
It's been a pleasure
haunting you.

19:12.870 --> 19:14.204
Thanks, Marv.

19:14.204 --> 19:16.740
You know, just out of curiosity,
where are you off to?

19:16.740 --> 19:18.742
I have to see a man
about a bright light.

19:18.742 --> 19:20.711
Right after I make a pit stop.

19:24.948 --> 19:26.650
Hey guys, what's going on?

19:26.650 --> 19:27.551
We're clearing
out of here.

19:27.551 --> 19:29.019
Grab all you
can carry.

19:29.019 --> 19:29.720
It turns out
it wasn't just you.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.221
The whole house
is possessed.

19:31.221 --> 19:33.390
And unlike scantily
clad teenagers
in slasher movies

19:33.390 --> 19:35.092
we know when
to leave.

19:35.092 --> 19:36.727
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
My Aunt Zelda explained

19:36.727 --> 19:38.162
why all these strange things
have been happening.

19:38.162 --> 19:40.597
She said it's due
to massive solar flares

19:40.597 --> 19:44.635
misalignment of the planets,
and some inflamed asteroids.

19:44.635 --> 19:47.738
So you're saying there's a rare
convergence of celestial events

19:47.738 --> 19:49.673
that has disrupted
electromagnetic fields?

19:49.673 --> 19:51.241
Exactly, and it's not going
to happen again

19:51.241 --> 19:53.310
for, like,
another kajillion years.

19:53.310 --> 19:55.345
So it's going to be over soon,
and we don't have to leave here?

19:55.345 --> 19:56.713
That's right.

19:56.713 --> 19:58.081
Oh, thank goodness.

19:58.081 --> 19:59.650
I was dreading the thought
of packing up

19:59.650 --> 20:00.884
all my skin care products.

20:00.884 --> 20:03.854
Well, I might as well
give this back to Garth.

20:03.854 --> 20:05.455
I've got to say, I'm
a little disappointed.

20:05.455 --> 20:08.692
I was really hoping to finally
encounter a supernatural entity.

20:08.692 --> 20:10.828
I'm beginning to think
it's never going to happen.

20:10.828 --> 20:12.863
Oh, don't despair, Miles.

20:12.863 --> 20:13.931
You know,
I'd be willing to bet

20:13.931 --> 20:16.567
you're a little closer
than you think.

20:20.012 --> 20:21.680
( <i>knocking</i> )

20:25.284 --> 20:26.618
Hi. I'm Gary.

20:26.618 --> 20:29.021
I'm here
to flush out your ghost.

20:29.021 --> 20:31.824
Unfortunately, we
never had a ghost.

20:31.824 --> 20:35.294
Whoa! That's a great rig
you got there, Gary.

20:35.294 --> 20:36.829
Where'd you get it?

20:36.829 --> 20:38.163
The Other Realm.

20:38.163 --> 20:39.598
"The Other Realm"?

20:39.598 --> 20:42.401
Wait, that's code
for a covert CIA operation

20:42.401 --> 20:44.002
in Central America, isn't it?

20:44.002 --> 20:47.239
Oh, geez, you're, uh, you're not
from the Other Realm are you?

20:47.239 --> 20:48.740
No, but I'm ready
to sign up.

20:48.740 --> 20:49.441
Don't call us.

20:49.441 --> 20:50.742
We'll call you.

20:51.443 --> 20:52.845
( <i>electronic beeping</i> )

20:56.315 --> 20:57.149
What do you know?
