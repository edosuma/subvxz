12:08.496 --> 12:10.030
Would you give us a minute, please.

12:10.032 --> 12:11.364
Of course.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.372
I understand that you're worried.

12:20.374 --> 12:23.509
Your Alpha missing, so far from home.

12:23.511 --> 12:25.878
I suggest you look in
your own ranks first.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.213
<i>Our</i> ranks? This is the house

12:28.215 --> 12:30.382
that has seen much death recently.

12:30.384 --> 12:32.217
I think that might include my Alpha.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.718
Do you have the nerve to say that

12:33.720 --> 12:35.687
in front of the council?

12:35.689 --> 12:38.390
They'll all be here within a few days.

12:38.392 --> 12:41.326
You know how we feel
about false accusations.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.830
- Need a hand?
- No, I got it.

12:45.832 --> 12:53.832
( ♪ )

12:58.511 --> 13:02.047
Every Pack has skeletons in the closet.

13:02.049 --> 13:03.782
You have your father.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.649
And... where is he?

13:05.651 --> 13:07.818
- This conversation is over.
- Fine.

13:07.820 --> 13:09.820
You want me to leave?

13:09.822 --> 13:12.256
Show me your house.

13:12.258 --> 13:14.358
- All of it.
- Eduardo...

13:16.395 --> 13:19.597
I don't have to show you anything.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.431
Then humor me.

13:21.433 --> 13:24.134
Please.

13:24.136 --> 13:27.004
I need to go back to
them with something.

13:27.006 --> 13:28.806
Be my guest.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.241
Jeremy: The scent of death
still lingers here.

13:31.243 --> 13:33.944
Two Mutts were killed in
the attack on Stonehaven.

13:33.946 --> 13:36.981
Elena was almost killed
protecting our Pack

13:36.983 --> 13:38.748
and everything down here.

13:38.750 --> 13:41.451
There is also the stench of bleach,

13:41.453 --> 13:43.920
as if you're trying
to cover something up.

13:43.922 --> 13:46.189
Elena: There was a lot of carnage.

13:46.191 --> 13:48.791
We take pride in our home

13:48.793 --> 13:51.027
and everything in it.

13:51.029 --> 13:52.762
Have you seen our Legacy?

13:54.331 --> 13:56.432
Quite the collection, yes.

13:56.434 --> 13:59.669
I may have leapt to a hasty assumption.

14:01.071 --> 14:03.039
I've seen everything I need to see.

14:03.041 --> 14:05.708
My humble apologies.

14:05.710 --> 14:07.476
One can only hope that every Pack member

14:07.478 --> 14:08.978
is as loyal to their Alpha

14:08.980 --> 14:11.880
as you clearly are to Rodrigo.

14:11.882 --> 14:14.450
I wish you best efforts in finding him.

14:14.452 --> 14:17.253
If we hear anything, we'll
be sure to contact you.

14:19.055 --> 14:20.589
Let's finish this.

14:26.095 --> 14:28.797
We could just burn Rodrigo here.

14:28.799 --> 14:32.400
We should be burning him
and Malcolm at the same time.

14:32.402 --> 14:35.236
We should've killed Malcolm
when we had a chance.

14:35.238 --> 14:38.006
We dispose of Rodrigo
now, the right way.

14:38.008 --> 14:40.341
This <i>can't</i> come back on Jeremy.

14:44.746 --> 14:45.746
(Car door closing)

14:45.748 --> 14:47.248
Woman: He gave me a bit of trouble,

14:47.250 --> 14:49.116
but I got him right where I want him.

14:50.219 --> 14:51.819
Okay. We'll wait here

14:51.821 --> 14:53.921
until you send word you're ready for us.

14:53.923 --> 14:56.558
Relax, Malcolm, you're
going to hurt yourself.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.925
The restraining spell I've got on you

14:57.927 --> 14:59.694
is going to make the
cage you just escaped

14:59.696 --> 15:01.428
seem like a Kleenex box.
Are you the creature

15:01.430 --> 15:03.698
- that attacked me in Rochester?
- No.

15:03.700 --> 15:05.432
But we are going to give you to him.

15:05.434 --> 15:08.102
You're just a goat on a chain.

15:08.104 --> 15:09.837
And if we need to defend ourselves,

15:09.839 --> 15:12.740
trust me, we've got that covered.

15:12.742 --> 15:16.776
So, this is what a great
werewolf looks like.

15:18.846 --> 15:20.380
Quite the specimen.

15:20.382 --> 15:22.416
I can see why he wants you.

15:22.418 --> 15:24.751
We can work together here, you know,

15:24.753 --> 15:26.286
eliminate him.

15:26.288 --> 15:28.021
Train you to work with us?

15:28.023 --> 15:29.789
Oh, I don't think so.

15:29.791 --> 15:32.226
I've seen what he's capable of.

15:32.228 --> 15:33.760
You need me.

15:33.762 --> 15:35.228
Of course we do.

15:35.230 --> 15:36.830
As the bait.

15:41.769 --> 15:44.237
Woman: (Muttering)
He is the one true path.

15:44.239 --> 15:46.840
He's the one true light on the path.

15:46.842 --> 15:48.908
The key to our gate.

15:48.910 --> 15:52.177
The light we follow through the gate.

15:52.179 --> 15:55.948
The key that unlocks us into the great...
(Indistinct)

15:55.950 --> 15:57.149
Hello?

15:57.151 --> 15:58.584
...The light we follow.

15:58.586 --> 16:00.653
The truth we follow...

16:02.188 --> 16:05.658
Don't let her bother you.
She's not feeling well.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.960
Was she the woman that was
screaming the other night?

16:07.962 --> 16:10.162
No, that was the woman from Rochester.

16:10.164 --> 16:11.930
Some pains to do with her pregnancy.

16:11.932 --> 16:13.431
But she's fine now.

16:13.433 --> 16:15.300
How is the new furniture in your room?

16:15.302 --> 16:17.102
Is everything to your liking?

16:17.104 --> 16:18.570
No.

16:18.572 --> 16:21.640
I'm locked away here.
Like I was with Ruth

16:21.642 --> 16:23.040
and Paige.

16:23.042 --> 16:26.177
It's for your safety.
We've been over that.

16:26.179 --> 16:28.346
And what power would you
like to learn today?

16:28.348 --> 16:30.047
Anything you want. Think of something

16:30.049 --> 16:32.517
your coven would never teach you.

16:32.519 --> 16:35.219
Maybe you could tell me something.

16:35.221 --> 16:37.889
I had a strange dream last night.

16:37.891 --> 16:39.323
A dream?

16:39.325 --> 16:41.492
Tell me about it.

16:41.494 --> 16:43.094
There was a man in a barn.

16:43.096 --> 16:46.297
I think that's where
he's hiding, only...

16:46.299 --> 16:48.699
he turns into a wolf.

16:48.701 --> 16:50.334
A wolf?

16:50.336 --> 16:51.535
A werewolf.

16:51.537 --> 16:54.071
And he's very powerful.

16:54.073 --> 16:55.606
I think his name was...

16:55.608 --> 16:58.642
Martin or... Marshall...

16:58.644 --> 17:01.044
Malcolm?

17:01.046 --> 17:02.379
That's it.

17:02.381 --> 17:04.647
And when you appeared, you were happy.

17:04.650 --> 17:06.517
You said that you'd
been looking for him.

17:08.386 --> 17:10.788
Your vision was very useful.

17:10.790 --> 17:13.190
If only we knew where this barn was.

17:13.192 --> 17:15.590
There was a sign. I wrote it down.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.665
Hm.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.468
Thank you for this, Savannah.

17:26.603 --> 17:28.871
Is there something else
you want to tell me?

17:31.074 --> 17:32.608
No.

17:35.446 --> 17:37.447
I am the lock.

17:37.449 --> 17:39.315
And I'm the key.

17:42.453 --> 17:43.953
Don't go alone.

17:43.955 --> 17:44.954
Why not?

17:44.956 --> 17:48.123
The wolf isn't by himself.

17:48.125 --> 17:50.425
That's fine.

None of that's true.

Malcolm killed my mother,

18:50.853 --> 18:52.786
slaughtered her.

18:52.788 --> 18:56.489
My father, he came home,

18:56.491 --> 18:58.558
saw it...

18:58.560 --> 19:01.094
He took his own life.

19:01.096 --> 19:03.931
But after all these years... I was wrong.

19:07.968 --> 19:10.269
Malcolm taught me to fight,

19:10.271 --> 19:11.604
to kill.

19:11.606 --> 19:14.407
I should've used that against him.

19:14.409 --> 19:16.910
We had him, Elena.

19:16.912 --> 19:19.612
We had him. I could've
ripped his throat out.

When this thing with
the witches is over,

19:25.786 --> 19:27.719
we make him pay for what he's done.

This alliance thing...
