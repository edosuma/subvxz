00:19.791 --> 00:23.500
<i>My father was born a long time ago,</i>

00:23.583 --> 00:26.083
<i>but he was a child like any other,</i>

00:26.166 --> 00:29.625
<i>prone to scraped-up knees</i>
<i>and flights of fancy.</i>

00:29.708 --> 00:31.583
-Have you found it?
-Not yet.

00:33.416 --> 00:36.708
<i>He was always good</i>
<i>at finding things.</i>

00:36.791 --> 00:40.291
-Yes! I got it, Mom.
-Are there any lollipops left?

00:40.375 --> 00:43.416
<i>That's him there,</i>
<i>just in case you were wondering.</i>

00:43.500 --> 00:44.333
Got 'em.

00:46.291 --> 00:48.833
-Coming through!
-Morning, Elmer.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.000
Morning, everyone.

00:50.083 --> 00:53.875
<i>Whatever his mom</i>
<i>called for, he could get it in no time.</i>

00:53.958 --> 00:55.208
Hey, Mr. Linson.

00:55.291 --> 00:56.208
Morning, Elmer.

00:56.291 --> 00:58.500
-Ooh.

00:58.583 --> 00:59.666
Be careful, Rosie.

01:02.333 --> 01:03.541
There you are, Elmer.

01:03.625 --> 01:07.041
Just in time
for Mr. Williams's sugar craving.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.541
Ah, strawberry is my favorite.

01:13.625 --> 01:15.250
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:15.750 --> 01:18.000
And to think that man is a dentist.

01:21.458 --> 01:26.250
Have you got any rubber bands? You know,
the kind that keeps beards out of soup?

01:26.333 --> 01:27.666
-Elmer?
-I'm on it.

01:28.250 --> 01:31.291
<i>Now,</i>
<i>my father would soon set foot in places</i>

01:31.375 --> 01:34.208
<i>no child had ever been before.</i>

01:34.291 --> 01:35.125
Here you go.

01:35.625 --> 01:39.208
<i>Dangerous, wild,</i>
<i>strange places,</i>

01:39.791 --> 01:42.208
<i>but he didn't know that yet.</i>

01:43.666 --> 01:45.041
Elmer, can you help me?

01:45.125 --> 01:46.500
-Morning, Dela.
-Morning.

01:46.583 --> 01:47.500
Morning, Elmer.

01:47.583 --> 01:50.250
-Morning, Magda.
-What have you got for us today?

01:50.333 --> 01:51.833
Tangerines.

01:51.916 --> 01:54.875
Everyone likes them
because they are easy to peel.

01:54.958 --> 01:58.083
-Check 'em out.
-How much are you asking?

01:58.166 --> 02:01.625
-Uh, for you, 30.
-Hmm. What do you think, Elmer?

02:01.708 --> 02:04.125
Well, these ones
from the bottom are overripe.

02:04.208 --> 02:07.458
-They're sprouting from the inside.
-Oh, so I see.

02:07.541 --> 02:09.416
We'll give you half on the tangerines.

02:09.500 --> 02:12.041
Twenty-five, Dela.
That's the best I can do.

02:12.125 --> 02:14.416
Twenty, and I'll take another load
from you next month.

02:15.583 --> 02:17.541
Your mom drives a hard bargain, Elmer.

02:18.708 --> 02:20.750
<i>My father lived</i>
<i>in a world</i>

02:20.833 --> 02:23.500
<i>that seemed like it would go on forever.</i>

02:24.583 --> 02:26.666
<i>But then it all began to change,</i>

02:27.458 --> 02:29.916
<i>and times got hard for a while.</i>

02:38.791 --> 02:40.333
What do we do now, Mom?

02:41.750 --> 02:45.583
You don't have to worry about a thing.
That's my job, Elmer.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.791
Maybe if we stay here,
our customers will come back,

02:48.875 --> 02:50.375
and it'll be okay again.

02:50.458 --> 02:53.166
I'm afraid the world
doesn't work like that.

02:53.250 --> 02:56.541
-But I'll get us a new home in the city.
-A new store?

02:56.625 --> 03:01.083
-Sure. Of course.
-But we have nothing left to sell.

03:01.166 --> 03:03.916
Oh. You're right.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.375
We'd better get some stock together
so we'll be ready for a grand opening.

03:08.458 --> 03:11.333
We don't need much,
just a few things to get us started.

03:11.416 --> 03:14.208
There's a strawberry lollipop.
It's kinda broken though.

03:14.291 --> 03:17.500
We could sell it cheaply
and still make enough to buy some more.

03:17.583 --> 03:19.791
You think you could find
more things to sell?

03:33.958 --> 03:36.000
That's it. That's all there is.

03:36.083 --> 03:39.166
-You're so good at finding things.

03:39.250 --> 03:41.875
We've even got a little bit of money left.

03:41.958 --> 03:44.250
-It'll get us started.

03:44.333 --> 03:46.333
Ready for an adventure?

03:46.416 --> 03:47.625
Ready.

04:45.625 --> 04:48.708
Read all about it! Recession hits!

04:48.791 --> 04:51.541
Who's gonna make it, and who's sunk?

04:52.375 --> 04:53.500
Read all about it.

04:54.416 --> 04:55.500
This is it.

04:56.583 --> 04:58.291
-Really?
-Yep.

04:58.375 --> 05:01.208
Nevergreen City, our new home.

05:08.791 --> 05:09.625
Look, Elmer.

05:11.125 --> 05:13.458
Wouldn't that make a fine store for us?

05:14.250 --> 05:16.375
But… it's all boarded up.

05:16.458 --> 05:18.500
Can you imagine what it would look like

05:18.583 --> 05:21.333
with a little bit of paint
and some attention?

05:21.416 --> 05:22.458
Can you see it?

05:23.666 --> 05:24.916
I guess.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.875
We could put some bright lights
on the windows.

05:28.833 --> 05:32.041
And before we know it,
we'll feel right at home.

05:34.375 --> 05:37.250
It will take me some time
to save up for all of that.

05:37.333 --> 05:42.208
But when I do,
we'll have all we need to get started.

05:42.791 --> 05:44.041
Don't let go of it.

05:44.125 --> 05:46.083
Don't worry, Mom. I won't let go.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.541
Our own store again.

05:48.625 --> 05:51.541
Just like it was before, right?
Just like home.

05:52.125 --> 05:54.625
Just like it. Trust me, okay?

05:55.416 --> 05:56.250
Okay.

05:56.750 --> 05:59.666
We just have to open these doors. Ready?

05:59.750 --> 06:01.333
One,

06:01.416 --> 06:03.083
two…

06:03.166 --> 06:04.958
-…three!

06:05.041 --> 06:07.375
-Out of my way! Come on!
-Whoa!

06:07.458 --> 06:09.458
The cat's too fast
for me, Callie.

06:09.541 --> 06:11.375
-Watch it, kid.
-Catch her!

06:15.666 --> 06:17.833
Elmer! Elmer!

06:17.916 --> 06:19.583
-Elmer, stay close to me.

06:20.375 --> 06:22.958
Come on. Help me with this.

06:23.041 --> 06:25.750
We've got to take it
all the way up to the top.

06:34.208 --> 06:38.458
-You didn't say anything about a kid.
-I didn't think it'd be a problem.

06:38.541 --> 06:41.625
Well, kids cost extra.
Four months' deposit upfront.

06:41.708 --> 06:43.166
But… that's ridiculous.

06:43.250 --> 06:45.791
Kids are loud and rough on furniture.

06:45.875 --> 06:47.875
But there isn't any furniture.

06:49.333 --> 06:52.416
That's 'cause the last kid broke it all.

06:52.500 --> 06:57.750
Uh, well, the ad said fully furnished,
so I can only give you a week's deposit.

07:01.375 --> 07:02.916
Please, Mrs. McClaren.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.625
We've come a very long way,
and this is a new start for us.

07:07.291 --> 07:09.541
We even brought our own chairs.

07:15.375 --> 07:16.583
Three weeks.

07:16.666 --> 07:17.708
Oh, great.

07:17.791 --> 07:20.416
Sorry, but you can't trust anyone
these days.

07:20.500 --> 07:23.458
-Nothing personal.
-Yes, of course. I understand.

07:23.541 --> 07:26.083
And no pets.
Pets are worse than kids.

07:26.166 --> 07:28.416
No pets. We don't have any pets.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.291
Rent's due every Tuesday,

07:30.375 --> 07:33.250
and there's not an excuse I haven't heard,
so don't bother.

07:33.333 --> 07:36.208
-You got it?
-Yes, I get it. Tuesday, rent due.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.625
Hey, Mom, I can see our store from here.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.708
Come on. It's a great view.

07:46.291 --> 07:50.041
Then that makes
this apartment the perfect spot.

07:52.125 --> 07:55.250
Here, we can save up
for the store in this.

07:58.083 --> 08:00.375
Soon, it'll be just like home.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.333
I think I'm getting a hang of these pipes.

08:41.416 --> 08:42.333
What'd you say?

08:42.416 --> 08:44.416
I said I figured out
how to not get splashed.

08:45.791 --> 08:47.041
That's great, Elmer.

08:57.791 --> 08:59.708
-Hello, Mrs. McClaren.

08:59.791 --> 09:01.416
Look, Elmer. We have a visitor.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.750
Hello, Mrs. McClaren. How are you today?

09:03.833 --> 09:08.166
Well, it's Tuesday.
I hear a lot of sob stories on Tuesdays.

09:08.250 --> 09:11.708
-It makes my indigestion flare.
-I'm sorry to hear that.

09:11.791 --> 09:12.750
Your rent's due.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.750
The pipes in here rumble and spray water.

09:16.791 --> 09:19.791
I'll pay you half this week
and half every week

09:19.875 --> 09:21.208
until the pipes are fixed.

09:21.291 --> 09:24.583
Look, I fix the pipes.
I got to charge you more.

09:24.666 --> 09:28.875
Everything costs money, Dela.
Don't you think I got troubles of my own?

09:28.958 --> 09:31.166
-Wait. Mom!
-See you next week.

09:34.541 --> 09:37.166
I'll figure out a way
to fill our savings jar.

09:37.666 --> 09:42.000
And then you won't have to worry anymore.
It'll just be you, me, and our new store.

09:42.083 --> 09:44.333
I need to borrow some change, all right?

09:44.416 --> 09:46.791
-But that's the money--
-I need to make calls.

09:46.875 --> 09:48.333
Come outside with me.

09:52.541 --> 09:53.875
Don't use them all up, Mom.

09:56.083 --> 09:59.083
-We can't get our store without it.
-It's just a few coins. No big deal.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.583
-How are we gonna--
-Hello.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.583
Yes, yes, I'm calling about the ad.

10:02.666 --> 10:05.416
I have my own truck. It's… it's gone?

10:05.958 --> 10:08.583
-All right. Bye.
-Mom?

10:08.666 --> 10:10.916
It's okay. Just one more.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.791
Hello. Hi, I'm calling about the ad.

10:13.875 --> 10:17.875
Wait. I have my own truck,
and the first delivery is free. All right.

10:20.833 --> 10:22.583
But, Mom, maybe I can help.

10:22.666 --> 10:25.250
I just need you to be quiet. Hello.

10:25.333 --> 10:28.583
Yes, yes, I'm calling about the ad.

10:28.666 --> 10:32.291
No, wait! You don't understand.
You see, I have my own truck…

11:03.875 --> 11:05.791
Get off of me!

11:05.875 --> 11:07.833
Callie, help!

11:07.916 --> 11:10.541
-Shoo! Shoo! Go, go, go!

11:10.625 --> 11:13.291
-Get your milk someplace else.

11:13.375 --> 11:14.666
Are you okay, Gertie?

11:15.291 --> 11:16.250
Uh-huh.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.208
-You ready, Eugene?
-I'm ready!

11:18.291 --> 11:20.208
And… hit it!

11:24.916 --> 11:27.958
'Tis a dark and dreary night!

11:28.041 --> 11:29.000
Aha!

11:29.083 --> 11:31.125
The wind is howling.

11:34.875 --> 11:40.208
A far-off land teeters
at the very edge of oblivion.

11:40.291 --> 11:41.500
Thank you very much.

11:41.583 --> 11:43.750
The animals cry out,

11:43.833 --> 11:46.791
"Is there no one who can save us?"

11:46.875 --> 11:48.041
Thank you.

11:48.125 --> 11:52.541
Yes! Yes! There is one who can save them.

11:54.416 --> 11:57.333
One who's traveled both far and wide…

11:57.916 --> 11:59.250
Rubber bands for sale!

11:59.333 --> 12:02.791
All kinds of colors. Amazing deals.
Get 'em before they're gone.

12:02.875 --> 12:06.875
-…a most amazing, stupendous, muscly--
-Rubber bands for every occasion.

12:06.958 --> 12:11.041
Red ones, blue ones. Rubber bands?
You look like you need rubber bands.

12:11.125 --> 12:17.375
A most amazing, brave,
fire-breathing dragon!

12:17.458 --> 12:19.750
Rubber bands?
So cheap they're almost free!

12:19.833 --> 12:21.041
Cheap? Free?

12:21.583 --> 12:22.625
Today only.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.291
Today only?

12:24.375 --> 12:26.000
-I said--
-Oh, I'd better hurry.

12:26.083 --> 12:29.500
-I know you need some rubber bands.
-A flying dragon!

12:29.583 --> 12:32.875
-You can wear them!
-That sure is a bargain.

12:32.958 --> 12:34.583
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Hey!

12:34.666 --> 12:38.666
You took our customer!
She was about to put that coin in <i>my</i> hat.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.125
Well, it's mine now.

12:40.208 --> 12:44.375
No, it's not.
'Cause we were here first doin' our show.

12:44.458 --> 12:48.041
Uh, looks like your show
isn't as spectacular as rubber bands.

12:48.666 --> 12:53.541
Okay. Here's how it's going to be.
You're either going to give me that coin,

12:53.625 --> 12:56.791
or you're gonna give me
something out of that backpack.

12:56.875 --> 12:59.500
-No.
-You must have something for our show.

12:59.583 --> 13:02.125
-It's mine.
-But you owe me. Fair is fair.

13:02.208 --> 13:03.875
-No, I don't!

13:03.958 --> 13:06.250
-Do so.

13:08.750 --> 13:11.000
-Get off!

13:11.583 --> 13:13.500
I got it, Callie!

13:13.583 --> 13:15.125
-Hey! Those kids--
-Come on.

13:15.208 --> 13:17.500
-We have to get back inside.
-Come back here!

13:17.583 --> 13:19.708
You take from me, I take from you.

13:19.791 --> 13:21.125
-They took--
-Please, come on.

13:21.208 --> 13:23.958
I'm tired,
and I have to cook supper. Okay?

13:24.041 --> 13:25.583
They…

13:48.750 --> 13:50.250
Hey there.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.750
How did you get in here?
Did you follow me?

13:57.500 --> 13:59.000
I'll be back in a minute.

14:00.958 --> 14:03.708
Don't drink all of that.
We need some for breakfast.

14:03.791 --> 14:04.625
Okay.

14:07.708 --> 14:09.000
-Shh!

14:09.083 --> 14:11.916
You've got to be quiet.
No pets allowed in the apartment.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.083
-Did you say something?
-No, Mom.

14:14.166 --> 14:16.791
-Come and eat before it gets cold.
-I'm coming.

14:16.875 --> 14:18.541
-Shh!

14:18.625 --> 14:21.875
Don't make a sound.
I'll figure something out.

14:22.625 --> 14:24.791
Hmm! That smells really nice, Mom!

14:28.666 --> 14:30.541
Hey, look at that.

14:32.708 --> 14:33.625
Mom, I--

14:33.708 --> 14:35.958
Are you trying to get us thrown out
on the street?

14:36.041 --> 14:39.000
'Cause if you are,
this is a good way to go about it.

14:39.083 --> 14:41.958
-You don't understand.
-There's nothing to understand.

14:42.041 --> 14:46.083
Put the cat back wherever you found it,
or Mrs. McClaren will tell us to go!

14:46.166 --> 14:49.916
-But, I didn't--
-I don't care. I don't have time for this.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.750
-I can explain.
-I've had enough.

14:51.833 --> 14:54.500
You're about to lie,
and I don't wanna hear it.

14:55.208 --> 14:59.208
You're the liar! You told me
we'd start up our store right out there!

14:59.291 --> 15:01.166
It's not that simple.

15:01.250 --> 15:02.416
But you promised!

15:02.500 --> 15:04.208
I didn't mean right now.

15:04.291 --> 15:08.541
-Why don't you tell me the truth?
-You want me to tell you the truth?

15:09.458 --> 15:12.750
I needed you to get out of the truck.
That's all.

15:12.833 --> 15:16.083
And now I need you to get
that cat out of this apartment!

15:16.166 --> 15:18.750
Because I have enough
to worry about, okay?

15:21.583 --> 15:22.500
I'm sorry.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.833
Don't be scared.

15:25.500 --> 15:26.833
I'm not scared!

15:27.833 --> 15:32.208
I'll get the money,
and I'll open the store myself.

15:32.291 --> 15:33.416
You'll see.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.291
-Elmer.

15:36.291 --> 15:39.208
Hey! No runnin' on the stairs!

15:39.291 --> 15:40.916
-Is that a cat?

15:41.000 --> 15:43.625
What in the world is going on?

15:43.708 --> 15:45.833
I'm doing this all by myself, Elmer.

15:57.958 --> 15:58.875
Elmer!

16:08.166 --> 16:10.666
<i>What do we do now, Mom?</i>

16:11.291 --> 16:14.250
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>to worry about a thing. That's my job.</i>

16:14.333 --> 16:15.875
<i>That's my job.</i>

16:15.958 --> 16:19.250
-<i>Maybe I can help.</i>
-<i> I just need you to be quiet.</i>

16:22.041 --> 16:23.916
<i>Hey! You come back here!</i>

16:24.000 --> 16:25.875
<i>That money belongs to us.</i>

16:25.958 --> 16:28.083
-<i>That's mine!</i>
<i>Get him!</i>

16:30.375 --> 16:31.833
<i>I don't have time for this.</i>

16:31.916 --> 16:33.375
<i>You didn't say anything about a kid.</i>

16:33.458 --> 16:34.916
<i>I didn't think it'd be a problem.</i>

16:35.000 --> 16:36.583
<i>Kids cost extra.</i>

16:36.666 --> 16:38.875
<i>I have enough to worry about, okay?</i>

16:38.958 --> 16:40.458
-<i>Elmer.</i>

16:40.541 --> 16:43.791
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

17:00.500 --> 17:01.333
Hey, cat.

17:02.833 --> 17:04.666
Why is everything so hard?

17:07.041 --> 17:08.625
Are you asking me, or…

17:08.708 --> 17:10.708
Whoa!

17:10.791 --> 17:11.666
Oh.

17:11.750 --> 17:13.583
You were just talking to yourself.
I get it.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.208
You're…

17:15.875 --> 17:17.875
-Whoa.
-Elmer. Elmer?

17:19.833 --> 17:22.000
Oh, for goodness' sake. Elmer!

17:22.083 --> 17:26.416
No.
You're… a talking cat? No, no, no.

17:26.500 --> 17:30.375
Let me know when you're ready,
and I'll answer any questions you have.

17:35.125 --> 17:37.958
How… how come you can talk?

17:38.041 --> 17:40.541
You were kind to me.

17:40.625 --> 17:45.458
So now I'm gonna return
that kindness… to you, Elmer.

17:45.541 --> 17:50.000
Um, are you, like,
gonna grant me seven wishes?

17:50.083 --> 17:52.208
I am not that kind of magic.

17:52.291 --> 17:54.625
And isn't it usually three wishes?

17:54.708 --> 17:57.208
Well… I need a lot of help.

17:57.291 --> 18:00.916
I need to open a store for my mom and me
so she doesn't have to worry anymore.

18:01.666 --> 18:03.750
But I haven't got any money, and--

18:03.833 --> 18:05.708
And this is where I can help.

18:05.791 --> 18:08.666
See, I don't just talk. I listen.

18:08.750 --> 18:12.125
Down here at the docks,
I hear about all kinds of things.

18:12.208 --> 18:15.375
Things that might earn
a young person like yourself

18:15.458 --> 18:17.750
the money you need to open your store.

18:17.833 --> 18:19.125
Like what?

18:19.208 --> 18:22.541
An amazing, spectacular,

18:22.625 --> 18:24.750
real live,

18:24.833 --> 18:29.458
flying, fire-breathing… dragon!

18:30.916 --> 18:33.583
Yeah, no. Dragons aren't real.

18:33.666 --> 18:36.875
Neither are talking cats.

18:36.958 --> 18:42.958
Can't you just imagine having your
very own dragon here in Nevergreen City?

18:43.041 --> 18:44.291
Yeah, but how--

18:44.375 --> 18:47.708
Just imagine.

18:55.541 --> 18:59.458
You and your mom won't have to worry
about another thing.

19:03.416 --> 19:04.791
Wow.

19:04.875 --> 19:08.958
I could sell rides
and candy and souvenirs!

19:09.041 --> 19:11.583
And Mom and I
could finally start our store!

19:12.416 --> 19:14.458
Tell me where the dragon is.
How do I get it?

19:14.541 --> 19:16.041
That's the easy part.

19:16.916 --> 19:21.333
It's just sitting there…
on this little, tiny island.

19:21.416 --> 19:23.833
But how do I get to the island?

19:23.916 --> 19:25.541
That's easy too.

19:25.625 --> 19:26.958
I got you a ride.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.833
-Whoa!

19:36.083 --> 19:38.375
-Say hello to Soda.

19:40.708 --> 19:42.875
That kinda tickles a little. Uh.

19:42.958 --> 19:43.791
Soda.

19:43.875 --> 19:45.208
-Yes?
-Say hello.

19:45.291 --> 19:49.958
-Hello!

19:50.041 --> 19:51.458
Uh, he's… he's got it, Soda.

19:51.541 --> 19:53.916
I'm supposed to ride
a whale to the island?

19:55.125 --> 19:57.375
It's the best I could do on short notice.

19:57.458 --> 19:58.375
Uh.

20:00.750 --> 20:02.625
Okay, okay. Phew.

20:03.125 --> 20:05.458
I… I just gotta figure out how to hold on.

20:05.541 --> 20:07.875
-Soda?
-Elmer!

20:07.958 --> 20:10.833
Take me to the island with the dragon.
Please?

20:13.916 --> 20:15.541
-Soda!
-Yes, yes, Cat?

20:15.625 --> 20:18.041
Better get going as fast as you can.

20:18.125 --> 20:19.583
Yee-haw!

20:19.666 --> 20:22.208
Or slow! Slow's okay too!

20:22.291 --> 20:24.416
Woo! Have a good time. Bye!

20:26.250 --> 20:30.166
He's such a good kid.
Hope he doesn't drown or get eaten.

20:30.250 --> 20:31.083
Or both.

20:36.916 --> 20:40.625
Soda, slow down!
I got nothing to hold on to!

20:40.708 --> 20:44.291
But I promised the cat I'd go fast.

20:44.375 --> 20:47.250
-Okay, but just not <i>so</i> fast.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.333
Medium fast. Good, good. I can do that.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.541
Woo-hoo!

20:51.625 --> 20:54.250
Wanna see why I'm called Soda?
Wanna see, wanna see?

20:54.333 --> 20:56.625
-Nope. Not real--

21:02.708 --> 21:05.958
-Did you see it? Did you?

21:06.041 --> 21:07.875
Yeah, yeah, I saw.

21:07.958 --> 21:11.375
I taught myself how to do that.

21:11.458 --> 21:14.833
-Great, Soda. 
-I made the whole thing up all by myself.

21:22.541 --> 21:25.250
-Wow.
-It's something, isn't it?

21:25.333 --> 21:27.083
I love dusk.

21:27.791 --> 21:31.083
One night, I wanna swim
all the way to the stars.

21:38.791 --> 21:41.666
Elmer! Elmer! Elmer!

21:41.750 --> 21:42.750
Are you awake?

21:42.833 --> 21:45.166
You're awake, right? You snore.

21:45.250 --> 21:46.416
Did you know that?

21:46.500 --> 21:49.541
Or maybe that was your tummy.
Does it talk when it's hungry?

21:49.625 --> 21:52.916
Hungry? Want something orangey?
'Cause it's almost morning, you know?

21:53.000 --> 21:56.333
We're in the middle of a sea.
Where are we gonna get--

21:58.000 --> 21:59.041
A tangerine?

22:00.166 --> 22:01.625
Ta-da!

22:02.125 --> 22:03.250
Whoa!

22:03.333 --> 22:05.625
This is Tangerina.

22:05.708 --> 22:07.291
Pretty spectacular, right?

22:07.375 --> 22:09.208
-Yeah.

22:09.916 --> 22:12.000
Best tangerines in town.

22:12.083 --> 22:14.125
Or, I mean, on the water.

22:14.208 --> 22:17.208
Best tangerines you'll ever taste.
That's for sure.

22:17.291 --> 22:20.375
Last stop till the island, so stock up.

22:29.458 --> 22:32.083
-Hmm! This is so good!
-Right?

22:35.791 --> 22:38.083
How about that? That's a train.

22:48.541 --> 22:51.750
Look! Elmer! Elmer, I made a nose!

22:51.833 --> 22:55.083
Look! It's just like yours!
Look quickly before it pops!

22:55.166 --> 22:57.250
Not bad. Not bad.

22:57.333 --> 23:00.958
Thanks!
Taught myself that one. No big deal.

23:07.125 --> 23:08.041
Wow!

23:08.125 --> 23:10.416
-That must be it.
-Yep.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.833
That's Wild Island.

23:14.416 --> 23:16.791
Did you say <i>Wild</i> Island?

23:16.875 --> 23:19.458
Yeah, 'cause of the wild animals.

23:19.541 --> 23:20.875
Wild animals?

23:20.958 --> 23:25.541
Yes. They have really big poky teeth
and poky claws.

23:25.625 --> 23:26.458
What?

23:26.541 --> 23:27.583
-Yep.
-Wait.

23:27.666 --> 23:29.250
They captured the dragon,

23:29.333 --> 23:31.958
so it can lift up the island
over and over again.

23:32.041 --> 23:34.833
-Why would anyone do that?
-'Cause it's sinking.

23:34.916 --> 23:38.750
-So this is a rescue?
-Didn't the cat tell you any of this?

23:39.416 --> 23:40.375
No!

23:40.458 --> 23:42.666
Well, surprise!

23:43.458 --> 23:44.583
I'm dead.

24:16.458 --> 24:19.291
-Bon voyage!

25:11.208 --> 25:14.666
Don't worry, dragon.
I'm here to r--

25:20.208 --> 25:22.750
Okay, okay.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.083
Oh my--

26:01.750 --> 26:03.041
Okay, okay.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.291
Let go of him!

27:07.375 --> 27:10.541
Hey, stop! I said knock it off!

27:10.625 --> 27:13.250
I can hardly hear Saiwa
with all your racket.

27:14.375 --> 27:17.166
Saiwa has made
the dragon save us once again,

27:17.250 --> 27:19.166
and this is how you show gratitude?

27:20.208 --> 27:24.500
Quiet down now.
There is no need to be afraid.

27:25.125 --> 27:27.958
I brought this dragon to us,

27:28.041 --> 27:30.458
and as long as he lifts us up,

27:30.541 --> 27:33.041
we will never be lost to the sea.

27:38.791 --> 27:39.625
Hey!

27:41.500 --> 27:44.291
Hush. Be calm, be calm.

27:45.125 --> 27:49.916
I have the answers.
I will save Wild Island.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.458
I can't take it.

27:51.541 --> 27:54.625
Saiwa's dragon is barely able
to lift the island now.

27:54.708 --> 27:56.458
Listen to him. Just listen.

27:58.500 --> 28:01.166
Each time, we lose more ground.
I lost my home this time.

28:01.250 --> 28:04.416
The most important thing
is that we all keep calm.

28:04.500 --> 28:07.041
I could have drowned!
You could drown next!

28:07.125 --> 28:08.583
And you, and you, and you--

28:08.666 --> 28:10.166
-Hey!

28:11.875 --> 28:13.458
Shut up, Tamir!

28:13.541 --> 28:14.375
Kwan?

28:14.875 --> 28:16.208
Yes, Saiwa?

28:16.291 --> 28:17.666
Give him to me.

28:17.750 --> 28:19.416
-Shush!

28:22.791 --> 28:24.875
Stop it. Stop it!

28:24.958 --> 28:27.833
I don't wanna drown.
I don't wanna drown.

28:27.916 --> 28:30.416
-Tamir, Tamir, Tamir!

28:30.500 --> 28:33.166
Listen to me. You are scaring everyone.

28:33.250 --> 28:36.375
I'm sorry, Saiwa.
I… I just don't wanna drown.

28:36.458 --> 28:39.083
I don't wanna drown!
I don't wanna drown! I--

28:39.166 --> 28:42.000
-Be calm. You are all safe.

28:42.666 --> 28:44.000
Be quiet!

28:45.041 --> 28:46.708
Let Saiwa speak.

28:48.916 --> 28:52.083
If we surrender to panic,
I cannot save you.

28:53.083 --> 28:54.208
No one can.

28:55.750 --> 28:59.166
Please, I simply ask you to trust me.

29:01.875 --> 29:02.916
The dragon--

29:03.000 --> 29:05.208
The dragon does what I make him do,

29:05.291 --> 29:08.500
and so should you
when I tell you to stop--

29:08.583 --> 29:10.166
-But, but--
-But what?

29:18.083 --> 29:18.916
Mom!

29:19.000 --> 29:20.208
Stop him, Kwan!

29:26.625 --> 29:28.083
Oh God--

29:28.166 --> 29:29.791
Let go! Let go!

29:34.625 --> 29:35.458
Kwan!

29:35.541 --> 29:38.375
Bring him down. We can't lose the dragon.

29:46.708 --> 29:50.541
Bring the Howlers.
We will track him and the child.

29:51.416 --> 29:55.708
This is not the time for panic.
We will recapture our dragon.

29:55.791 --> 29:56.708
But he'll hide.

29:56.791 --> 29:58.833
No. They can't hide from me.

29:58.916 --> 29:59.875
Huh.

30:40.750 --> 30:41.583
Whoa!

30:45.000 --> 30:46.125
Yeah!

30:46.875 --> 30:48.666
I… I did it!

30:48.750 --> 30:53.166
I actually saved an amazing,
spectacular, real live, fire-breathing…

30:56.708 --> 30:58.041
…dragon?

30:58.125 --> 31:01.291
Oh, ah, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ow. Ow. Ow.

31:01.375 --> 31:03.625
I… I mean you no harm, dragon.

31:05.916 --> 31:07.958
-Huh?

31:08.041 --> 31:10.166
-Oh!

31:10.250 --> 31:12.625
-Ow.

31:13.583 --> 31:16.083
I think I hurt myself.

31:19.125 --> 31:20.791
Oh, you rescued me!

31:20.875 --> 31:22.291
-Ooh!
-It's my lucky day.

31:22.375 --> 31:26.125
I'm so lucky I could explode!
Hold… hold still so I can thank you.

31:29.541 --> 31:33.125
-What's the matter? You not a hugger?

31:33.208 --> 31:35.625
Too cool for a public display
of affection?

31:36.708 --> 31:37.541
Yeah, me too.

31:39.041 --> 31:41.666
-Are you for real?

31:41.750 --> 31:44.583
Of course I'm real.
If I was made up, could I do this?

31:51.208 --> 31:52.458
No.

31:52.958 --> 31:54.000
What do you think?

31:54.916 --> 31:57.458
-This is not good.
-It's a work in progress.

32:03.250 --> 32:05.625
Okay. Yeah, I… I can make this work.

32:06.250 --> 32:08.291
All right.

32:08.375 --> 32:12.125
Dragon, I rescued you,
so you owe me something in return.

32:12.208 --> 32:13.041
Right?

32:13.666 --> 32:16.125
I would lay down my life for you.

32:16.666 --> 32:18.416
No, you don't have to do--

32:18.500 --> 32:20.416
-Ooh.
-I would dry up oceans with fire

32:20.500 --> 32:23.041
and destroy mountains
with my roar for you.

32:23.125 --> 32:27.458
That's oka-- Wait, you can do that?

32:27.541 --> 32:29.291
No.

32:29.375 --> 32:30.625
Not at all, really.

32:30.708 --> 32:34.541
I get dizzy around large bodies of water,
and I'm afraid of fire.

32:36.416 --> 32:39.000
It can really hurt. Ow. Ow.

32:39.083 --> 32:42.625
This is what hurts right now. Ow.
How many wings am I holding up?

32:43.333 --> 32:46.750
One, but the other wing looks
kinda floppy.

32:46.833 --> 32:50.250
This is the thanks I get
for lifting the island over and over?

32:50.333 --> 32:51.750
I told them it doesn't work.

32:51.833 --> 32:54.083
Because if it did,
I'd already be an After Dragon.

32:54.166 --> 32:56.041
-What?
-An After Dragon.

32:56.125 --> 32:58.291
It's only the best thing… ever.

32:58.375 --> 33:00.208
-Here, come with me.
-No, no!

33:06.083 --> 33:09.291
Ow. Ooh. Ooh. That hurt even more.

33:09.833 --> 33:11.041
Boy, where are you?

33:13.500 --> 33:15.000
-Oh gosh.

33:15.083 --> 33:17.125
-Sorry, sorry, sorry.
-Why did you--

33:17.208 --> 33:20.833
I was trying to fly,
but my wing, it's just not working.

33:20.916 --> 33:23.500
Great. This is great.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.166
I'm stuck on an island full
of wild animals with poky teeth.

33:28.833 --> 33:31.375
I just saved a dragon who can't fly?

33:31.458 --> 33:32.458
Uh-huh.

33:32.541 --> 33:34.458
-Who's afraid of water?
-Uh-huh.

33:34.541 --> 33:36.041
Has a fear of fire?

33:36.875 --> 33:37.708
Uh-huh.

33:37.791 --> 33:39.750
But dragons breathe fire.

33:39.833 --> 33:40.958
Not me.

33:41.041 --> 33:42.708
Can you do anything?

33:44.458 --> 33:45.875
I can do this.

33:47.166 --> 33:48.541
Hold on. Hold on.

33:48.625 --> 33:51.000
Wait. I'm usually
a lot sweatier than this.

33:51.083 --> 33:52.500
-Okay, stop.

33:54.708 --> 33:57.625
-Did you just--
-That was… my armpit.

33:58.875 --> 34:01.458
Look over here.
It's that thing I wanted to show you.

34:01.541 --> 34:04.333
That's what I'll look like
after I get my fire.

34:04.416 --> 34:06.291
When I save the island.

34:07.916 --> 34:08.916
See?

34:09.583 --> 34:10.750
Not really.

34:10.833 --> 34:14.875
Well, dragons have been coming
to Wild Island for thousands of years.

34:14.958 --> 34:19.625
Because when we turn 100,
which is only 100 divided by

34:19.708 --> 34:21.916
ten in human boy years, which is…

34:23.291 --> 34:24.916
which is…

34:25.750 --> 34:26.583
Uh…

34:26.666 --> 34:27.666
Ten. It's ten!

34:27.750 --> 34:30.416
Ten! I said it at the same time.
When we're ten years old,

34:30.500 --> 34:34.250
we come here to Wild Island
to do a rite of passage,

34:34.333 --> 34:37.333
like bees to a flower,
except for dragons, not bees.

34:37.416 --> 34:39.416
And it's an island, not a flower.

34:39.500 --> 34:44.750
We have to save Wild Island from sinking
'cause it sinks every 100 years.

34:44.833 --> 34:48.583
If we can do that, we become After Dragons

34:48.666 --> 34:54.333
who breathe fire and have muscles
and who are smart and brave like this.

34:57.208 --> 35:01.291
I'm pretty sure I'll look just like that
after I save the island and get my fire.

35:01.375 --> 35:04.416
Wait. You already saved the island.
I saw you do it.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.291
No. That's the way Saiwa made me do it.

35:06.375 --> 35:09.000
But it can't be right
because it just sinks worse the next time.

35:09.083 --> 35:12.166
And it's scary and fiery and bad up there.

35:12.250 --> 35:14.333
So how are you supposed to do it?

35:14.416 --> 35:16.500
I have… no idea.

35:16.583 --> 35:18.750
-I'm just not an answer guy.

35:18.833 --> 35:21.166
-It doesn't mean there isn't one.
-Nope.

35:21.250 --> 35:25.041
-There must be a way to figure it out.
-None. Except for Aratuah.

35:25.125 --> 35:28.125
-Who's that?
-He's a really old tortoise.

35:28.208 --> 35:31.583
He was here when Horatio saved the island,
so he knows all about dragons.

35:31.666 --> 35:33.166
He drew this muscly After Dragon.

35:33.250 --> 35:36.583
-All right. Let's go ask him.
-Except I don't know where he is.

35:36.666 --> 35:38.541
Aw, come on!

35:38.625 --> 35:41.083
When I landed on the island,
I looked for him,

35:41.166 --> 35:44.958
and looked and looked
and looked and looked.

35:45.583 --> 35:48.708
I thought maybe Aratuah would leave me
a sign or some kind of map

35:48.791 --> 35:50.458
or something, right?

35:50.541 --> 35:53.125
-Why are you making that face?
-I'll help you.

35:53.208 --> 35:54.875
You'd do that for me?

35:54.958 --> 35:56.541
-Yes.

35:56.625 --> 35:59.750
But after I help you become
an After Dragon, you'll help me.

35:59.833 --> 36:01.166
Of course.

36:01.250 --> 36:03.833
We'll come back to Nevergreen
and be in my dragon show.

36:03.916 --> 36:07.375
Except that after my rite of passage,
I'm supposed to go home.

36:07.458 --> 36:08.833
It's gonna be awesome.

36:08.916 --> 36:13.791
All my family will fly up to see me,
and I'll blow fire, and they'll all cheer.

36:14.375 --> 36:18.875
Okay. Well, I did rescue you,
and it doesn't have to be forever.

36:18.958 --> 36:21.708
I just need you to help me
earn enough money for my store.

36:22.208 --> 36:24.500
-Do we have a deal?
-Okay. Sounds good.

36:27.250 --> 36:29.250
Uh, okay.

36:29.333 --> 36:32.875
I'm gonna call you… Answer Guy.

36:32.958 --> 36:34.958
-Elmer. My name is Elmer.

36:35.041 --> 36:37.541
Of course you have a cool name like that.

36:37.625 --> 36:42.166
My name's Boris. Not as cool,
but it goes with my face.

36:42.916 --> 36:43.875
I lied to you, Elmer.

36:43.958 --> 36:46.583
-That fart didn't come from my armpit.
-I don't wanna know.

37:06.500 --> 37:07.666
They're on foot.

37:08.500 --> 37:11.375
The dragon's wing must be badly wounded.

37:11.458 --> 37:12.333
Badly wounded?

37:14.791 --> 37:15.875
Oh no!

37:15.958 --> 37:19.666
It's a catastrophe!
We're gonna-- No, no!

37:19.750 --> 37:22.625
Saiwa, how can you stand
that runt in your ear?

37:22.708 --> 37:24.625
-Cut him loose.
-Who you calling a runt?

37:24.708 --> 37:27.833
I won't cut him loose.
He'll cause panic. You know that, Kwan.

37:28.833 --> 37:31.416
What if we're squandering our chance
to leave a doomed island?

37:31.500 --> 37:33.958
Now, now. 

37:34.041 --> 37:35.791
Saiwa!

37:35.875 --> 37:37.500
He's close.

37:40.916 --> 37:44.041
My brother Horatio
taught me to spit really far,

37:44.125 --> 37:47.416
and I bet I could hit that tree.
Do you wanna see? Elmer?

37:47.500 --> 37:50.208
-Uh, can you keep an eye out for arrows?
-Okay.

37:50.708 --> 37:54.791
I'm actually really hungry right now.
Skunk cabbage is my favorite.

37:54.875 --> 37:57.958
You don't suppose there are any
around here? There's an arrow!

37:58.041 --> 38:00.791
Nope. Nope. There's an arrow!
No, no, no, sorry. False alarm.

38:00.875 --> 38:02.000
Hey, you know what?

38:02.083 --> 38:04.541
-I'll be the arrow finder, okay?
-Sure.

38:04.625 --> 38:07.250
Just be quiet so I can concentrate.

38:12.208 --> 38:13.708
Oh my gosh.

38:16.375 --> 38:18.750
It's a whole little world of strawberry!

38:21.833 --> 38:24.791
Do not touch the stuff
in my backpack. Got it?

38:24.875 --> 38:26.125
-Really?
-I mean it.

38:26.875 --> 38:29.041
-Okay.

38:29.125 --> 38:29.958
Why?

38:30.041 --> 38:32.083
-'Cause I need everything in here.
-Why?

38:32.166 --> 38:34.458
-'Cause I do.
-So it's very important?

38:34.541 --> 38:36.958
-Yes!
-More important than that arrow?

38:39.500 --> 38:40.333
Oh!

38:41.250 --> 38:42.791
Okay. Great. This way.

38:42.875 --> 38:45.750
Yeah! Aratuah, here we come.

38:45.833 --> 38:47.916
-Huh?

38:53.458 --> 38:54.583
What was that?

38:55.500 --> 38:59.000
-Uh, Saiwa's coming after us!
-Coming after us?

38:59.083 --> 39:02.375
He's coming after us!

39:05.375 --> 39:06.750
We can get across here.

39:07.250 --> 39:08.125
Uh…

39:08.791 --> 39:09.708
Elmer?

39:09.791 --> 39:13.291
Remember when I said…
that water makes me dizzy?

39:13.375 --> 39:17.333
Come on, Boris. I don't wanna
get eaten by anyone with poky claws

39:18.458 --> 39:20.625
-or poky… teeth!

39:25.958 --> 39:28.916
-Crocodiles!
-And water. Don't forget the water.

39:32.625 --> 39:35.250
And Saiwa's coming! I can't go back.

39:35.333 --> 39:39.333
It's so scary up there at the summit.
All the fire. It'll burn me up!

39:39.416 --> 39:41.416
They won't get you. I'll make sure of it.

39:41.500 --> 39:45.000
Wow, I like that answer.
Nothing's gonna stop us.

39:47.583 --> 39:48.708
Except maybe him!

39:55.375 --> 39:58.583
What do you think you're doing, dragon?

40:02.000 --> 40:06.500
Douglas, Winifred,
you get back here right now.

40:06.583 --> 40:11.333
Children! It's not safe,
you naughty little reptiles.

40:13.541 --> 40:15.541
Ease up, will you?

40:15.625 --> 40:18.291
You're squeezing the life out of me.

40:18.375 --> 40:21.458
This is all your fault, dragon.

40:21.541 --> 40:24.958
What do you think you're doing,
swanning about down here?

40:25.041 --> 40:27.083
This isn't exactly swanning!

40:27.166 --> 40:29.458
-What in the world is this thing?

40:29.541 --> 40:30.583
That's an Elmer.

40:30.666 --> 40:34.333
He's the answer guy.
He's gonna help me save the island.

40:34.416 --> 40:35.958
Quickly, this way!

40:36.041 --> 40:38.833
You? Save Wild Island?

40:38.916 --> 40:42.041
You're pulling my leg.

40:42.125 --> 40:44.916
-Hey! Stop pulling my leg!

40:45.000 --> 40:47.916
Hurry, Boris.
We gotta… climb to the other side!

40:48.000 --> 40:49.625
Now, where was I?

40:50.250 --> 40:51.916
I'll snap you in two.

40:54.333 --> 40:55.375
Come on, Boris!

40:55.458 --> 40:57.541
This is so hard.

40:59.916 --> 41:01.333
-Elmer!

41:03.083 --> 41:06.375
-You dragon thief!

41:06.458 --> 41:08.750
You have the wrong end
of the stick, crocodile!

41:08.833 --> 41:11.458
My name is Cornelius. And I agree!

41:13.000 --> 41:15.583
No!

41:24.458 --> 41:25.583
What's happening?

41:25.666 --> 41:27.833
Oh no. Come on, wee ones.

41:27.916 --> 41:30.041
Quick. Here you go.
Come on. Let's go.

41:36.916 --> 41:38.750
Elmer! Elmer!

41:38.833 --> 41:41.000
-Hurry, Boris!
-Have you got a better answer?

41:41.083 --> 41:43.083
This one's not working so well for me.

41:45.708 --> 41:47.291
And Saiwa's coming.

41:49.291 --> 41:51.125
-Don't make me go back!
-Come on, Boris!

41:51.208 --> 41:52.541
Oh, no, I can't.

41:52.625 --> 41:54.666
Saiwa, your dragon is here.

41:54.750 --> 41:55.875
He's here!

41:56.375 --> 41:57.375
Elmer!

41:57.458 --> 41:59.541
-Look, Boris! It's all yours.

41:59.625 --> 42:00.583
Strawberry.

42:00.666 --> 42:02.416
Strawberry?

42:02.500 --> 42:03.458
Come and get it.

42:03.541 --> 42:06.791
Strawberry is almost as tasty
as skunk cabbage.

42:07.375 --> 42:09.708
-Get him!
-Look at me, Boris.

42:09.791 --> 42:12.583
Boris, look at me.
You just gotta keep on going.

42:12.666 --> 42:13.791
We're almost there.

42:14.375 --> 42:16.541
-Elmer!
-Come on!

42:27.666 --> 42:29.375
Boris!

42:31.333 --> 42:33.625
Uh, oh.

42:34.208 --> 42:35.833
Grab onto the lollipop.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.708
Oh! Whoa! Help!

42:41.958 --> 42:43.583
Whoa!

42:47.166 --> 42:48.333
I've got you.

42:58.333 --> 42:59.416
-Saiwa!

43:05.041 --> 43:06.750
-Kwan!

43:06.833 --> 43:09.000
-I can't hold them.
-But I have him.

43:16.666 --> 43:18.083
Children! Help!

43:18.166 --> 43:19.833
Kwan, you must save them.

43:19.916 --> 43:21.291
Kwan!

43:22.833 --> 43:23.750
Kwa--

43:26.125 --> 43:27.416
-Kwan!

43:52.041 --> 43:53.125
It stopped.

43:53.208 --> 43:56.166
For now, but… it'll happen again

43:56.666 --> 43:59.291
and again and again.

43:59.375 --> 44:00.833
Let's keep moving, then.

44:00.916 --> 44:03.291
Got any more
of those strawberry things?

44:03.375 --> 44:06.416
No. And paws off the backpack. Okay?

44:06.500 --> 44:10.875
Well… I'm pretty sure I could go faster
if you showed me what's in there.

44:10.958 --> 44:11.833
No.

44:11.916 --> 44:13.083
Aw, come on.

44:16.041 --> 44:17.666
Hey.

44:17.750 --> 44:18.750
Boris, stop!

44:19.750 --> 44:21.375
Really? Why?

44:21.458 --> 44:25.375
Look, I don't have time to explain.
The island is sinking. Remember?

44:26.333 --> 44:27.250
Okay.

44:28.083 --> 44:28.916
Let's go.

44:39.458 --> 44:46.250
Oh, Douglas, Winifred, I was so worried.
Where's George? George!

44:47.500 --> 44:49.333
Am I alive? Am I alive?

44:51.041 --> 44:53.208
Alive. Most definitely alive.

44:53.291 --> 44:55.541
-Hey! Cut it out! Stop it!

44:55.625 --> 44:58.375
Oh, children, there you are.

44:58.458 --> 45:00.416
Oh, thank you, Kwan.

45:00.500 --> 45:02.541
-Saiwa? Saiwa!

45:03.500 --> 45:06.833
-It's sinking faster now.
-Oh, oh, now he's worried.

45:08.250 --> 45:10.000
Oh, not now, Kwan. Not now.

45:10.083 --> 45:13.750
But I had the dragon. I had him.
Why did you make me turn back?

45:13.833 --> 45:15.250
Listen. Listen to me.

45:15.333 --> 45:19.375
The whole island will be gone
if we don't recapture that dragon!

45:20.666 --> 45:21.916
They all look to me.

45:23.583 --> 45:25.583
Do you understand? To me.

45:28.083 --> 45:30.250
Someday, they will look to you.

45:30.333 --> 45:34.000
-And you must not abandon them.
-But our home will be gone.

45:34.083 --> 45:37.041
We still have time to capture our dragon.

45:37.625 --> 45:38.708
Trust me.

45:50.500 --> 45:53.708
-Hey, buddy, what do you think?
-About what?

45:57.791 --> 46:00.291
It's… um, nice?

46:00.375 --> 46:02.833
Great! That could be
our secret friendship whistle.

46:02.916 --> 46:07.333
-You know, 'cause we're friends now.
-I'm not really a whistler.

46:07.416 --> 46:10.583
Are you kidding me?
What if you meet another wild animal,

46:10.666 --> 46:13.958
or I hurt my other wing
or see a Howler or Kwan or Saiwa?

46:14.041 --> 46:18.166
-How are we supposed to call each other?
-By saying "help"?

46:18.250 --> 46:20.291
Oh, come on! Anyone can do that.

46:20.375 --> 46:22.958
You don't even have to be
friends or anything.

46:32.791 --> 46:35.791
-Not funny!

46:37.291 --> 46:38.666
Are you scared?

46:38.750 --> 46:42.041
No! I am cautious. There is a difference.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.458
-Where did you get that scarf?
-It's so soft.

46:47.541 --> 46:51.166
It feels really good against my skin.
Go on. Give it a feel.

46:52.291 --> 46:53.458
Boris.

46:55.375 --> 46:58.375
It's not really a soft scarf, is it?

46:59.208 --> 47:00.291
Uh…

47:03.208 --> 47:05.500
-George, look who it is!

47:05.583 --> 47:06.916
No.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
No way. You're messing with me.

47:12.750 --> 47:15.375
Elmer? I'm feeling really cautious.

47:16.875 --> 47:18.708
I'm going to be a hero!

47:18.791 --> 47:22.666
-I captured Saiwa's dragon for him.

47:22.750 --> 47:24.666
Well, <i>we</i> captured him.

47:27.250 --> 47:28.791
-What's this thing?

47:28.875 --> 47:30.666
It looks sweet and chewy.

47:31.166 --> 47:33.250
Sasha, give it here.
I'll take the first bite.

47:33.333 --> 47:35.916
And I'll take the dragon to Saiwa.

47:36.583 --> 47:38.750
-Hey! No, you don't. I'll take it.

47:43.625 --> 47:47.208
You look just like a sweet, juicy melon

47:47.291 --> 47:50.250
with bits of hair stuck to you.

47:54.083 --> 47:56.083
Stop it, Sasha.

47:58.333 --> 48:00.208
-Sasha.

48:00.291 --> 48:01.416
Elmer!

48:02.708 --> 48:03.750
Help!

48:04.416 --> 48:05.250
He's mine!

48:05.333 --> 48:07.625
No! That sweet little morsel is mine!

48:09.250 --> 48:11.375
Wait! I have something sweet!

48:11.458 --> 48:12.708
Obviously.

48:12.791 --> 48:16.125
No, no, much sweeter.
Cinnamon-flavored bubble gum!

48:18.416 --> 48:22.375
Every chew releases a whole new burst
of mouthwatering sweetness!

48:22.458 --> 48:24.958
You've not tasted anything like it before,

48:25.041 --> 48:28.916
and it will be the… the highlight
of your entire existence.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.958
It comes from a little town far away,
and… it tastes like home.

48:33.041 --> 48:34.000
-Oooh.
-Yum.

48:34.083 --> 48:36.458
-Oh, yes. Give me! Give it!
-I want some!

48:36.541 --> 48:37.416
-Mine!
-Mine!

48:37.500 --> 48:38.583
Mine!

48:38.666 --> 48:41.666
I've only got one,
so you're gonna have to fight for it!

48:48.750 --> 48:49.625
Elmer?

48:49.708 --> 48:51.000
Boris!

49:06.375 --> 49:07.708
Sinking, sinking.

49:07.791 --> 49:10.625
Every morning,
every night, sinking, sinking!

49:10.708 --> 49:12.875
-Sinking.

49:24.125 --> 49:25.208
What is it, Boris?

49:25.291 --> 49:27.666
I'm calling you.

49:27.750 --> 49:30.750
-Yes, I get it, but what do you want?
-Okay, good.

49:30.833 --> 49:33.625
I gotta stop and catch my breath.

49:33.708 --> 49:36.916
-Not a good idea.
-I'm a better flier… than a walker.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.708
The sooner we find Aratuah,
the sooner we get out of here.

49:41.750 --> 49:42.833
What?

49:42.916 --> 49:46.375
You know, you said no more stuff
from the backpack,

49:46.458 --> 49:49.166
but you gave those tigers
that cinnamon-flavored bubble gum,

49:49.250 --> 49:53.083
so is the new rule "no stuff from
the backpack unless we're gonna die?"

49:54.083 --> 49:56.750
Sounds like you got your breath back,
so let's go.

49:56.833 --> 49:59.291
Okay. Is Neverblue your home?

49:59.375 --> 50:02.250
Nevergreen.
It's called Nevergreen.

50:02.333 --> 50:05.458
It's just a place where I live,
but it's not my home.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
I used to have a store with my mom.

50:08.083 --> 50:10.791
-So that's your home, then?
-Uh, no, not anymore.

50:10.875 --> 50:13.375
-Then where's your home?
-I don't have one right now.

50:13.458 --> 50:16.041
But I will when I set up the store.

50:16.125 --> 50:18.041
-That you had.
-No. A new one.

50:18.125 --> 50:20.583
Oh, so this store's gonna
be different 'cause it's new?

50:20.666 --> 50:22.750
No, it's… it's gonna be the…

50:22.833 --> 50:24.041
…same!

50:25.333 --> 50:27.500
Elmer!

50:28.416 --> 50:30.250
Elmer, are you okay?

50:30.333 --> 50:34.333
Yeah, I'm… I'm fine.
Just be careful where you stand.

50:34.416 --> 50:36.125
Somebody set this trap.

50:36.208 --> 50:37.166
What?

50:40.791 --> 50:42.416
Oh my gosh.

50:43.666 --> 50:45.500
Elmer, you've gotta see this.

50:45.583 --> 50:49.000
There are so many
cute little furry mouse things.

50:49.750 --> 50:50.750
Hello!

50:51.541 --> 50:54.916
What? Oh, I get it.

50:55.750 --> 50:58.958
Yeah, it's a trap for me.

50:59.041 --> 51:02.416
-You gotta get me out of here!
-Don't worry. I know what to do.

51:02.500 --> 51:05.958
Throw me your backpack, sweater,
shirt, pants. Everything.

51:06.041 --> 51:09.166
Good idea.
We can tie a rope out of my clothes.

51:09.250 --> 51:11.833
Oh. Yeah. That's probably better.

51:11.916 --> 51:15.000
-Wait, what was your plan?
-Doesn't matter. We can try it your way.

51:20.958 --> 51:22.125
Something's down here!

51:24.083 --> 51:25.125
Boris.

51:25.208 --> 51:27.208
Here's a stick. Grab on.

51:28.458 --> 51:31.333
-I can't reach it, Boris! I gotta get out!
-Okay.

51:34.916 --> 51:38.041
-Boris, you gotta help!
-Just a second!

51:41.458 --> 51:42.708
-Boris?

52:00.000 --> 52:02.291
Elmer! Elmer?

52:03.875 --> 52:04.791
Elmer!

52:10.000 --> 52:11.291
Elmer!

52:11.375 --> 52:13.458
-Answer me!
-Don't come down, Boris.

52:13.541 --> 52:17.166
It's… useless. It's useless.

52:17.250 --> 52:19.416
-You're just scared.

52:19.916 --> 52:22.833
-Don't worry. It's going to be okay.

52:22.916 --> 52:24.791
Get real.

52:24.875 --> 52:29.000
We are in a hole on a sinking island.

52:29.083 --> 52:32.708
It's not gonna be okay.

52:36.833 --> 52:38.416
I know you're hungry.

52:38.916 --> 52:41.791
I'll get you something. I promise.

52:44.166 --> 52:46.083
Does… he like tangerines?

52:46.166 --> 52:47.666
You got tangerines?

52:47.750 --> 52:50.250
-My baby loves tangerines.

52:50.333 --> 52:52.625
-Here you go.

52:53.250 --> 52:55.583
-My name's Iris.
-I'm Elmer.

52:56.166 --> 52:58.583
You're the boy who took Saiwa's dragon.

52:58.666 --> 53:03.541
They made this trap for you,
but I fell in with my baby.

53:03.625 --> 53:04.583
I… I'm sorry.

53:04.666 --> 53:08.291
Why did you do it?
Why did you take the dragon?

53:08.375 --> 53:11.916
-He needed to be rescued.
-But who's gonna rescue us?

53:12.000 --> 53:15.041
Saiwa, he had a way of keeping us safe.

53:15.125 --> 53:18.666
If that was true, the island would've been
safe for a hundred years,

53:18.750 --> 53:21.750
and Boris would be an After Dragon.
Don't you see?

53:22.875 --> 53:25.958
-I just want it to be okay again.

53:26.625 --> 53:27.458
It will be.

53:28.208 --> 53:31.250
I'm taking Boris to Aratuah
to find the real answer.

53:31.333 --> 53:33.125
And we'll be safe then?

53:33.916 --> 53:35.000
I'm sure of it.

53:35.083 --> 53:38.041
Well, that would be such a relief,

53:38.125 --> 53:41.291
if we weren't trapped
in a hole with no way out.

53:41.375 --> 53:43.625
-Boris is up there. He can help--

53:47.041 --> 53:49.041
Get away from him!

53:49.125 --> 53:52.583
Whoa, a baby! Ha, you little coochie coo.

53:52.666 --> 53:56.500
-Boris! You jumped in.
-Of course. I had to help my friend.

53:56.583 --> 53:59.791
-But… how are we gonna get out?

54:15.291 --> 54:17.416
Hey, hey! Stop fighting!

54:17.500 --> 54:20.958
Stop! Let go!
Saiwa, there's something down here.

54:23.958 --> 54:25.083
Calm down, Tamir.

54:25.166 --> 54:28.416
-Saiwa says calm down! Calm down!
-Everybody, shut up!

54:29.416 --> 54:32.125
Dragon… you can come out.

54:35.333 --> 54:36.541
You won't be harmed.

54:37.833 --> 54:38.666
I promise.

54:45.750 --> 54:48.625
-It's only me, Saiwa. Me and my baby.

54:48.708 --> 54:49.833
Iris?

54:49.916 --> 54:51.458
-Come on, Saiwa.
-Wait, Kwan.

54:51.541 --> 54:53.583
-Let's keep moving.
-We have to get them out.

54:55.958 --> 54:57.708
Can't you stop them fighting?

54:57.791 --> 54:59.458
Hush. Hush now.

54:59.541 --> 55:01.500
Hold on, Iris. We'll get you out.

55:08.916 --> 55:10.416
Wait, wait, wait!

55:10.500 --> 55:13.166
-What is it?
-I… I heard them, Saiwa.

55:13.250 --> 55:14.750
The dragon and the boy.

55:15.916 --> 55:19.166
The boy said
he was taking the dragon to the summit.

55:19.250 --> 55:21.750
That doesn't make sense.
The dragon hates it there.

55:21.833 --> 55:25.791
The boy doesn't want to drown.
None of us do, Saiwa.

55:26.458 --> 55:28.750
If anyone can help him now, it's you.

55:28.833 --> 55:30.625
-Just you.

55:30.708 --> 55:33.708
-Let's go to the summit!
-We have to get her out first.

55:33.791 --> 55:36.541
We could sink at any second.
We don't have time.

55:36.625 --> 55:37.833
Kwan!

55:37.916 --> 55:39.541
No, it's okay.

55:41.041 --> 55:41.875
See?

55:42.375 --> 55:44.625
We'll be all right, Iris.

55:44.708 --> 55:47.833
-Howlers, come.

55:57.583 --> 55:58.416
They're gone.

55:58.916 --> 56:00.500
That was very brave.

56:01.458 --> 56:02.916
Thank you, Iris.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.958
Elmer, Saiwa has forbidden
all the animals from going there…

56:07.791 --> 56:10.500
…but I know where Aratuah is.

56:13.750 --> 56:17.583
<i>I hope you find the answer,</i>
<i>for all our sakes.</i>

56:18.333 --> 56:20.041
<i>You're on your own from here.</i>

56:23.750 --> 56:25.750
Uh…

56:25.833 --> 56:27.458
Don't worry. I'll go first.

56:27.541 --> 56:28.958
Okay. Sure.

56:31.333 --> 56:32.916
Are you all right, Boris?

56:33.000 --> 56:36.958
Yeah. It's just I'm nervous,
anxious, scared,

56:37.041 --> 56:39.166
and I got that dizzy thing going on.

56:39.250 --> 56:41.083
-Sorry.

56:47.833 --> 56:48.875
That must be him.

56:53.875 --> 56:57.375
-I'm gonna faint.
-Breathe. Just don't forget to breathe.

57:06.541 --> 57:10.083
Uh, can you ask him?
Just ask him for me, will ya?

57:12.458 --> 57:14.541
Okay.

57:16.916 --> 57:18.208
Ancient Aratuah?

57:19.708 --> 57:21.041
We've come to ask you,

57:22.458 --> 57:24.791
how is a dragon supposed
to save Wild Island?

57:24.875 --> 57:28.750
-And fix my wing.
-And fix… Boris's wing?

57:29.291 --> 57:32.166
If… that's something that you do.

57:35.708 --> 57:39.666
Uh, Boris is the dragon
who has come to save the island.

57:39.750 --> 57:41.083
Ask about my fire.

57:41.166 --> 57:45.041
Can you… tell the dragon Boris
how to get his fire?

57:46.125 --> 57:48.458
Even if it's like a… a riddle or a--

57:48.541 --> 57:50.250
-Puzzle?
-No. Uh…

57:50.333 --> 57:53.958
Like… like a task we need
to do first or… or something.

57:54.041 --> 57:57.000
It's just… that we don't have much time.

57:59.916 --> 58:01.708
Uh, Aratuah?

58:02.875 --> 58:04.791
Ancient Aratuah?

58:04.875 --> 58:06.000
What if that's his…

58:09.000 --> 58:10.208
Oh.

58:10.291 --> 58:11.750
Yeah. Right.

58:13.041 --> 58:15.583
-It was his butt.
-Shh.

58:15.666 --> 58:18.000
-Aratuah?

58:20.833 --> 58:22.833
-You know what? You try.
-What? No.

58:22.916 --> 58:24.500
-Just tell him.
-I can't.

58:24.583 --> 58:27.666
-Elmer!
-Just do it. Just go!

58:29.375 --> 58:30.208
Uh…

58:36.125 --> 58:37.958
Is that supposed to happen?

58:38.041 --> 58:39.583
Wait a second, Boris.

58:40.791 --> 58:42.875
Elmer? Aratuah?

58:43.541 --> 58:45.416
We've been looking for so long.

58:46.375 --> 58:47.250
Aratuah!

58:50.083 --> 58:53.041
What did he say? Elmer, what did he say?
Can I see? Can I see him?

58:53.125 --> 58:55.833
-No. Don't go in there. No.
-Come on, let me see.

58:55.916 --> 58:57.958
-I wanna-- Aratuah!
-Stop. Don't go in there.

58:58.041 --> 59:00.500
Sorry about cracking your shell.
It was an accident.

59:00.583 --> 59:01.541
-No! Stop!
-Aratuah!

59:01.625 --> 59:02.458
He's dead!

59:07.083 --> 59:07.958
He's dead?

59:11.875 --> 59:13.291
What do I do now, Elmer?

59:14.583 --> 59:17.958
I… I… I--

59:19.958 --> 59:21.166
Come on, Boris.

59:21.958 --> 59:22.791
We gotta go!

59:50.750 --> 59:52.375
Boris? Are you okay?

59:53.166 --> 59:55.458
I just need to lie down someplace warm.

59:56.916 --> 59:58.125
I'll look after you.

59:58.208 --> 59:59.166
Elmer?

59:59.250 --> 1:00:02.583
You spoke to Aratuah?
You know how to save us?

1:00:04.541 --> 1:00:05.708
We… we did.

1:00:05.791 --> 1:00:08.333
-Oh, that's wonderful!

1:00:09.375 --> 1:00:12.875
Yeah, but before he can do
his rite of passage,

1:00:12.958 --> 1:00:15.375
Boris just-- He needs to rest, you know?

1:00:15.458 --> 1:00:18.333
Oh, of course. Of course.
I know just the place.

1:00:38.375 --> 1:00:40.958
Right at the top is safe and dry.

1:00:41.791 --> 1:00:44.375
-You can rest there.
-Thank you, Iris.

1:00:44.458 --> 1:00:48.750
No, no, no. Thank you… so much.

1:00:58.666 --> 1:01:00.208
You must be hungry.

1:01:13.250 --> 1:01:15.083
You said it's not for sharing.

1:01:15.666 --> 1:01:17.083
Forget what I said.

1:01:17.833 --> 1:01:19.500
Just… help yourself.

1:01:25.916 --> 1:01:28.166
That's what I used
to free you from the vines.

1:01:30.125 --> 1:01:31.875
That helped me see Iris in the pit.

1:01:40.333 --> 1:01:42.833
Do you like… tangerines, Boris?

1:01:44.125 --> 1:01:45.583
Tangerines?

1:01:54.625 --> 1:01:56.458
No, no, that's for you.

1:01:59.666 --> 1:02:02.958
You eat just the peel
and not the fleshy part?

1:02:03.583 --> 1:02:05.666
Of course not.

1:02:05.750 --> 1:02:08.125
Then this is gonna work out just fine.

1:02:08.208 --> 1:02:12.375
I forgot how good they taste.

1:02:17.291 --> 1:02:19.666
My brother Horatio brought me
tangerines home

1:02:19.750 --> 1:02:21.875
when he became an After Dragon.

1:02:21.958 --> 1:02:26.041
I could hear his whistle…
in the sky over Blueland.

1:02:26.708 --> 1:02:28.416
Everyone was so proud.

1:02:29.708 --> 1:02:32.125
No one's ever going to be proud of me.

1:02:37.416 --> 1:02:39.375
-Can I tell you a secret?
-Yeah.

1:02:40.125 --> 1:02:43.791
I'm kind of relieved that I'm not expected
to do anything now

1:02:43.875 --> 1:02:47.291
because the truth is
I couldn't do it anyway.

1:02:49.250 --> 1:02:52.625
That's what I really feel
in the pit of my stomach.

1:02:53.583 --> 1:02:56.041
I bet you'd be
a great After Dragon, Boris.

1:02:56.125 --> 1:03:01.541
You always know what to do, Elmer.
You don't seem to be scared of anything.

1:03:01.625 --> 1:03:03.041
Well, I--

1:03:03.125 --> 1:03:05.083
I don't know what I'd do without you.

1:03:05.166 --> 1:03:08.916
I'd be burned up at the summit
or drowned in the sea.

1:03:10.541 --> 1:03:12.791
You're right. I'm not scared of anything.

1:03:14.875 --> 1:03:16.250
Just rest.

1:03:16.333 --> 1:03:18.666
When you wake up, I'll have the answer.

1:03:19.416 --> 1:03:21.250
This really was my lucky day.

1:03:22.166 --> 1:03:24.458
And tomorrow's gonna be even luckier.

1:04:38.375 --> 1:04:41.375
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Elmer.</i>

1:04:41.458 --> 1:04:45.000
<i>I'm sorry. Elmer, I'm sorry.</i>

1:04:45.875 --> 1:04:50.750
<i>I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.</i>

1:04:50.833 --> 1:04:54.458
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Elmer.

1:04:54.541 --> 1:04:55.375
Mom?

1:04:55.875 --> 1:04:57.916
I'm so sorry, Elmer.

1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:01.333
-For what?
-He made me tell him where you were.

1:05:01.416 --> 1:05:03.208
-I had to protect my baby.

1:05:03.291 --> 1:05:04.625
So it's true.

1:05:05.416 --> 1:05:06.625
-Boris!
-I'm up.

1:05:06.708 --> 1:05:08.375
-Boris, get up!
-I'm up!

1:05:08.458 --> 1:05:11.625
Look at all the trouble
you have caused us,

1:05:11.708 --> 1:05:13.791
you worthless thing!

1:05:13.875 --> 1:05:16.000
Stay away from us, Kwan.

1:05:16.875 --> 1:05:19.041
-Boris, stop!
-You're coming with me!

1:05:19.125 --> 1:05:20.291
Tell him, Boris,

1:05:20.375 --> 1:05:24.291
that you spoke to Aratuah,
that you know how to save the island.

1:05:25.500 --> 1:05:26.916
You spoke to Aratuah?

1:05:27.625 --> 1:05:30.458
He told us the real answer, not Saiwa's.

1:05:33.250 --> 1:05:35.333
Then he can stop all of this.

1:05:35.916 --> 1:05:37.666
No, he cannot.

1:05:38.291 --> 1:05:39.791
Isn't that right, dragon?

1:05:40.500 --> 1:05:42.375
Elmer? Please help.

1:05:42.458 --> 1:05:46.708
Aratuah did not help him
because he's dead.

1:05:46.791 --> 1:05:48.291
-Dead?
-Dead?

1:05:48.375 --> 1:05:50.125
-Elmer.

1:05:51.166 --> 1:05:53.625
-I… I…
-How could you?

1:05:53.708 --> 1:05:56.291
Do you remember the day
you came here, dragon?

1:05:56.375 --> 1:05:58.625
You had no idea how to save this island.

1:05:58.708 --> 1:06:03.250
I helped you do
what you knew you could not.

1:06:03.333 --> 1:06:04.500
Please, Elmer.

1:06:04.583 --> 1:06:07.541
Now all you have to do
is come with me now.

1:06:07.625 --> 1:06:10.250
-We will save the island again.
-I don't wanna go back--

1:06:10.333 --> 1:06:11.416
Together.

1:06:11.500 --> 1:06:12.916
-I can't.
-Leave him alone!

1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:16.375
Ok, quiet, boy!
He's our dragon, not yours.

1:06:18.083 --> 1:06:19.208
No, Boris!

1:06:19.291 --> 1:06:20.833
-Dragon!
-I don't wanna go back.

1:06:20.916 --> 1:06:22.750
-No!
-Elmer!

1:06:27.708 --> 1:06:29.125
-Aw!

1:06:30.291 --> 1:06:31.208
My wing!

1:06:55.625 --> 1:06:58.208
Yeah!

1:06:59.333 --> 1:07:00.666
Whoo-hoo!

1:07:04.125 --> 1:07:06.791
I told you I'm a better flier
than a walker.

1:07:07.916 --> 1:07:10.500
We can go now.
I can take you back to Nevergreen.

1:07:12.416 --> 1:07:13.250
Yeah.

1:07:24.291 --> 1:07:26.000
<i>I hope you find the answer,</i>

1:07:26.833 --> 1:07:28.166
<i>for all our sakes.</i>

1:07:28.708 --> 1:07:30.291
<i>They captured the dragon</i>

1:07:30.375 --> 1:07:33.416
<i>so it could lift up</i>
<i>the island over and over again.</i>

1:07:33.500 --> 1:07:34.333
<i>Why?</i>

1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.250
Roots. They're dragging it down.

1:07:39.875 --> 1:07:42.208
If we can lift it high enough
to snap the roots…

1:07:42.291 --> 1:07:43.833
-What?
-…we can save the island!

1:07:43.916 --> 1:07:45.708
-Roots?
-I have the answer!

1:07:45.791 --> 1:07:49.625
Because you're the answer guy!
I knew you'd come through!

1:07:49.708 --> 1:07:52.125
-Yeah.
-Let's go!

1:07:52.208 --> 1:07:56.166
-Is it? Look! I knew it!

1:07:56.250 --> 1:07:57.375
Aw, hurrah.

1:07:57.458 --> 1:07:59.583
-There is still hope.
-I knew it! I knew it!

1:07:59.666 --> 1:08:04.083
That dragon is useless,
and so are you, Saiwa.

1:08:04.166 --> 1:08:06.083
-We can recapture him.

1:08:06.166 --> 1:08:09.958
For what? He can't save the island!

1:08:10.041 --> 1:08:13.583
And you can't either,
no matter how much you talk.

1:08:14.083 --> 1:08:17.083
That little runt there knew it
from the start!

1:08:17.166 --> 1:08:20.625
I listened to you. I trusted you.

1:08:20.708 --> 1:08:21.583
Kwan?

1:08:21.666 --> 1:08:22.791
But not anymore.

1:08:23.375 --> 1:08:29.041
I'm getting off of this sinking mudhole!

1:08:29.125 --> 1:08:33.666
I'm gonna take care of myself,
and you can all drown together!

1:09:03.833 --> 1:09:05.666
Oh my God. What… What's… happened?

1:09:07.041 --> 1:09:10.458
Elmer, it's like it cracked open.
What… what do we do now?

1:09:10.541 --> 1:09:13.041
-I have to tie you up, okay?
-What?

1:09:13.125 --> 1:09:15.875
No, no! That… that was Saiwa's idea, and--

1:09:15.958 --> 1:09:18.666
-Calm down. You need to listen to me.
-That can't be right.

1:09:18.750 --> 1:09:21.541
If we lift the island high enough,
it'll snap the roots.

1:09:21.625 --> 1:09:24.916
No, no, no.
Look at this place. I'll mess up. I--

1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000
No, you won't because I'm coming with you.

1:09:27.083 --> 1:09:29.916
-We're gonna do it together.
-Doesn't seem right.

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:34.208
I freed you. I can free the island.
This is the answer.

1:09:36.166 --> 1:09:37.250
Do it fast.

1:09:43.833 --> 1:09:45.208
Okay, Boris. Go!

1:09:45.291 --> 1:09:46.916
-Lift, lift!
-Yeah.

1:10:20.708 --> 1:10:23.208
-Come on! You can do this! Lift! Lift!

1:10:35.750 --> 1:10:39.000
-You're almost there. Come on, now.

1:10:39.083 --> 1:10:42.000
You're doing it!
Come on, just a little more!

1:10:44.625 --> 1:10:47.958
-You're doing it, Boris! You're doing it!

1:10:55.041 --> 1:10:57.250
Boris? Boris, what's wrong?

1:10:57.333 --> 1:10:59.458
Are you okay? You've gotta lift.

1:10:59.541 --> 1:11:01.333
-Lift!
-I have the answer.

1:11:04.208 --> 1:11:06.583
Come on! Lift! Lift!

1:11:06.666 --> 1:11:08.541
-You can't be here, Elmer.
-What?

1:11:08.625 --> 1:11:11.250
-I have to let you down.
-No, no, no! Boris, please!

1:11:14.541 --> 1:11:15.833
Please! Come on!

1:11:19.208 --> 1:11:21.083
Lift! Lift!

1:11:34.166 --> 1:11:37.041
-Lift! Come on, bud!

1:12:08.291 --> 1:12:09.458
Quick, untie me.

1:12:10.375 --> 1:12:12.958
Boris, we have to get out of here.

1:12:13.041 --> 1:12:15.666
-But I understand now.
-Hold still, Boris.

1:12:15.750 --> 1:12:19.666
We were flying and you said I could do it,
and I believed it for the first time.

1:12:19.750 --> 1:12:23.333
-Hold still, or I can't cut you free.
-I could feel it in the pit of my stomach.

1:12:23.416 --> 1:12:25.750
We don't have time now.
The island is done for.

1:12:25.833 --> 1:12:28.500
Listen, it didn't work
because you don't have the answer.

1:12:28.583 --> 1:12:29.750
-Stop!
-I do.

1:12:29.833 --> 1:12:32.250
-No! Just stop!
-I have to go in there.

1:12:43.875 --> 1:12:45.416
I have to do it on my own.

1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:50.833
No! You know what will happen. Just stop!

1:12:50.916 --> 1:12:53.375
-I can't stop!
-You'll burn up in there.

1:12:53.458 --> 1:12:56.291
-You're wrong.
-Listen, I can help. Just let me help.

1:12:56.375 --> 1:12:59.916
-Just stop, Boris. Stop.
-No. I've gotta go. Just let me go!

1:13:01.958 --> 1:13:03.916
You'll never be an After Dragon!

1:13:13.125 --> 1:13:14.166
Come on.

1:13:15.333 --> 1:13:16.500
Leave me alone.

1:13:16.583 --> 1:13:19.291
No! Because I have to get us out
of this mess!

1:13:19.375 --> 1:13:20.875
I said leave me alone!

1:13:31.083 --> 1:13:32.000
Forget you too.

1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:14.833
Saiwa?

1:14:14.916 --> 1:14:19.583
Hey! Shh! Leave him alone.
He has to find fresh water, shelter, food,

1:14:19.666 --> 1:14:22.375
you know, little stuff like that
so we don't die.

1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:26.208
I… I might have something left for you.

1:14:26.291 --> 1:14:29.875
We don't need anything from you.

1:14:29.958 --> 1:14:32.125
-I was trying to--

1:14:35.416 --> 1:14:37.208
I… I thought I could help.

1:14:37.750 --> 1:14:38.583
Help?

1:14:39.625 --> 1:14:42.125
I… helped.

1:14:42.708 --> 1:14:47.291
When the island started sinking,
I went to Aratuah, but he was gone.

1:14:48.208 --> 1:14:50.875
I knew fear would drown us
long before the sea,

1:14:50.958 --> 1:14:54.583
so… I kept the truth from them.

1:14:55.500 --> 1:14:58.541
And when the dragon came,
we thought we were saved.

1:14:59.666 --> 1:15:02.875
But he was foolish… and frightened.

1:15:02.958 --> 1:15:06.500
Don't say that. He pulled
the island up for you over and over.

1:15:06.583 --> 1:15:10.500
I used him, yes, to keep us safe.

1:15:10.583 --> 1:15:12.541
-What did you use him for?

1:15:12.625 --> 1:15:14.791
I… I didn't. I'm his friend.

1:15:15.458 --> 1:15:19.000
Oh. I see.

1:15:19.583 --> 1:15:21.666
He thought you were his friend.

1:15:22.250 --> 1:15:24.041
-I…

1:15:25.875 --> 1:15:26.708
Foolish.

1:15:27.708 --> 1:15:28.750
And frightened.

1:16:00.750 --> 1:16:03.458
Boris! Boris!

1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:24.250
Boris!

1:16:32.416 --> 1:16:33.250
Boris?

1:16:36.625 --> 1:16:38.000
I'm sorry, Boris.

1:16:38.083 --> 1:16:42.000
No. You were right. I can't do it, Elmer.

1:16:43.041 --> 1:16:44.791
I can't save anyone.

1:16:45.666 --> 1:16:47.208
I can't do anything.

1:16:48.500 --> 1:16:49.666
I'm too scared.

1:17:02.625 --> 1:17:04.125
I get scared too.

1:17:07.791 --> 1:17:09.541
I get scared all the time.

1:17:10.375 --> 1:17:13.000
I try to figure everything out,
but I can't.

1:17:13.916 --> 1:17:14.750
You?

1:17:15.416 --> 1:17:17.583
Go get your fire.

1:17:18.291 --> 1:17:20.833
And I'll be here for you
when you get back.

1:17:27.166 --> 1:17:28.000
Thank you.

1:20:46.041 --> 1:20:48.458
Boris.

1:20:56.291 --> 1:20:58.791
Boris.

1:20:58.875 --> 1:21:00.250
Come on, Boris, please.

1:21:42.125 --> 1:21:43.125
Boris?

1:21:49.958 --> 1:21:50.958
Boris!

1:21:51.041 --> 1:21:52.208
Boris, you did it!

1:22:00.291 --> 1:22:01.833
Boris! Yeah!

1:22:03.166 --> 1:22:05.083
-Yes!

1:22:06.083 --> 1:22:07.583
Yeah!

1:22:09.166 --> 1:22:12.708
-Boris! You did it, Boris!
-You should have seen it, Elmer.

1:22:12.791 --> 1:22:15.750
The whole place was
like the pit of my stomach.

1:22:50.583 --> 1:22:55.000
You know, these After Dragon drawings,
they're not very realistic, are they?

1:22:55.083 --> 1:22:56.500
I think there's a resemblance.

1:22:56.583 --> 1:22:57.416
Yeah?

1:22:57.500 --> 1:22:59.250
I'm an After Dragon.

1:22:59.333 --> 1:23:02.208
-Boris? Elmer?

1:23:02.916 --> 1:23:05.208
We just wanted to say thank you.

1:23:05.791 --> 1:23:07.041
Thank you, Boris.

1:23:08.166 --> 1:23:09.291
Thank you, Boris.

1:23:20.416 --> 1:23:23.500
-I believe this is yours.

1:23:23.583 --> 1:23:24.666
Aw.

1:23:25.833 --> 1:23:28.708
-Look! It's Saiwa.

1:23:33.791 --> 1:23:36.291
I thought I was doing the right thing.

1:23:37.208 --> 1:23:38.958
I thought I had the answer.

1:23:40.750 --> 1:23:41.791
I had nothing.

1:23:44.166 --> 1:23:45.291
I am sorry.

1:23:48.125 --> 1:23:50.708
You know what Wild Island needs now?

1:23:51.291 --> 1:23:52.250
It needs you,

1:23:53.583 --> 1:23:55.958
all of you, to tell my story.

1:23:56.583 --> 1:23:57.875
Draw it up here

1:23:58.458 --> 1:23:59.583
without the muscles.

1:24:01.125 --> 1:24:04.208
So when the island sinks again
in a hundred years

1:24:04.291 --> 1:24:06.250
and the next dragon comes,

1:24:07.125 --> 1:24:10.583
you're not gonna tie them up
or chase them or scare them.

1:24:11.125 --> 1:24:12.958
You'll be their friend.

1:24:13.041 --> 1:24:15.000
You have my word, Boris.

1:24:15.791 --> 1:24:16.750
It will be done.

1:24:19.833 --> 1:24:20.666
Tamir.

1:24:22.666 --> 1:24:23.500
Tamir.

1:24:23.583 --> 1:24:24.916
I--

1:24:34.833 --> 1:24:36.666
-Bye! See ya!
-Bye, Boris.

1:24:36.750 --> 1:24:38.000
Bye, Boris!

1:24:38.083 --> 1:24:39.333
Bye, hairy melon!

1:24:39.916 --> 1:24:41.083
Bye, Wild Island!

1:24:45.416 --> 1:24:47.416
Whoo-hoo!

1:25:06.666 --> 1:25:09.458
Kwan! Kwan! Kwan! Look over here, Kwan.

1:25:09.541 --> 1:25:12.750
-Can you just be quiet for one minute?
-Kwan, come on.

1:25:12.833 --> 1:25:14.208
Elmer!

1:25:15.500 --> 1:25:17.083
-Hey, Soda!
-You did it!

1:25:17.166 --> 1:25:20.666
-Did what? What did he do?
-He helped me save the island, Kwan.

1:25:20.750 --> 1:25:23.208
You might wanna hitch a ride back!

1:25:26.791 --> 1:25:28.875
I'm proud of you!

1:25:50.833 --> 1:25:51.666
Soft landing.

1:25:53.750 --> 1:25:55.375
Yeah. Nicely done.

1:25:55.458 --> 1:25:57.791
So this is Neverblue.

1:25:57.875 --> 1:25:59.500
Nevergreen.

1:26:05.250 --> 1:26:06.125
Oh.

1:26:06.875 --> 1:26:09.000
Okay. What do you want me to do?

1:26:12.458 --> 1:26:13.291
Nothing.

1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:14.958
What?

1:26:15.041 --> 1:26:16.125
You wanna go home,

1:26:16.791 --> 1:26:20.500
whistle to your family through the clouds
over Blueland, right?

1:26:20.583 --> 1:26:22.416
Sure I do, more than anything.

1:26:23.291 --> 1:26:24.541
What about the store?

1:26:25.125 --> 1:26:28.166
And solving all your problems?
I mean, what are you gonna do?

1:26:30.375 --> 1:26:31.500
I'll figure it out.

1:26:33.708 --> 1:26:35.125
Are you scared?

1:26:35.208 --> 1:26:36.041
Yeah.

1:26:36.541 --> 1:26:37.375
Yeah.

1:26:37.916 --> 1:26:39.291
Me too.

1:26:43.750 --> 1:26:47.666
-Well, I guess this is, uh…
-Um, I--

1:26:47.750 --> 1:26:49.166
-Goodbye.
-…it?

1:26:49.250 --> 1:26:51.916
It was nice to meet you.

1:27:08.708 --> 1:27:10.458
I'll be seeing you, Boris.

1:27:13.625 --> 1:27:14.833
If you ever need me…

1:27:56.416 --> 1:27:57.250
Elmer!

1:27:58.291 --> 1:28:01.833
Your mom's been looking for you.
Your supper's almost cold.

1:28:01.916 --> 1:28:03.375
-My supper?
-Elmer!

1:28:09.916 --> 1:28:10.750
Mama.

1:28:19.958 --> 1:28:22.708
-I'm sorry, Mom.
-And I'm sorry.

1:28:22.791 --> 1:28:23.625
I got scared.

1:28:25.083 --> 1:28:26.541
I got scared too.

1:28:59.833 --> 1:29:01.708
That ought to do it, Dela.

1:29:06.416 --> 1:29:08.041
Oh. Perfect. Yeah.

1:29:11.708 --> 1:29:12.791
Hey there.

1:29:14.375 --> 1:29:18.000
-Come on. Hey, Mom, can I borrow your hat?
-That's my good one.

1:29:18.083 --> 1:29:19.000
Thanks, Mom!

1:29:19.083 --> 1:29:21.000
-Oh no.
-No! Elmer!

1:29:32.125 --> 1:29:34.958
I was thinking how about
once I turn into an After Dragon,

1:29:35.041 --> 1:29:38.541
I make like I'm going to fly away,
but then-- Hey!

1:29:41.166 --> 1:29:42.416
What took ya so long?

1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:44.375
I found some more props.

1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:46.416
-Okay.
-I got it, Callie.

1:29:46.500 --> 1:29:49.041
-That was the plan.
-That looks great, guys.

1:29:49.125 --> 1:29:50.708
Are you sure you know how to juggle?

1:29:50.791 --> 1:29:52.458
-Tangerines?
-Thanks.

1:29:52.541 --> 1:29:54.583
<i>My father always said</i>

1:29:54.666 --> 1:29:58.708
<i>that dragons make</i>
<i>the very best of friends.</i>

1:29:59.625 --> 1:30:02.291
<i>They'll see you through</i>
<i>the scariest of times,</i>

1:30:02.375 --> 1:30:04.708
<i>even if they're</i>
<i>a little bit scared themselves.</i>

1:30:05.916 --> 1:30:10.041
<i>But for those of you who believe</i>
<i>that dragons are nothing but nonsense,</i>

1:30:11.208 --> 1:30:15.958
<i>well… it's always good</i>
<i>to keep your ears open…</i>

1:30:17.166 --> 1:30:19.375
<i> …just in case.</i>
