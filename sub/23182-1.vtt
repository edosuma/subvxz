00:12.992 --> 00:14.659
All right. After autumn...

00:14.692 --> 00:16.826
Ask anyone around the area
about accuracy.

00:16.859 --> 00:18.559
Arctic activities
are abundant,

00:18.592 --> 00:21.092
astonishing, astounding and
A‐1 on all accounts.

00:21.126 --> 00:22.959
‐Back up...
‐But before beach bodies,

00:22.992 --> 00:24.559
bros better bundle up
in boots,

00:24.592 --> 00:25.959
blankets, and balaclavas

00:25.992 --> 00:27.226
because a bloody,
bitter breeze

00:27.259 --> 00:28.959
will blow brisk,
blustery and bleak.

00:28.992 --> 00:30.992
‐Careful...
‐Correct and common to cocoon

00:31.026 --> 00:32.626
in a cap, coat and comforter,

00:32.659 --> 00:34.526
because a cutting cold
can consume your character,

00:34.559 --> 00:35.892
occasionally create a corpse

00:35.926 --> 00:37.126
and continually compress
your cock.

00:37.159 --> 00:38.792
‐Don't...
‐Don't you dare dawdle,

00:38.826 --> 00:40.892
dilly‐dally, or dick around
after dark in December,

00:40.926 --> 00:43.059

‐Easily...
‐Each and every earthling's

00:44.659 --> 00:45.892

00:45.926 --> 00:47.626
‐Fact...
‐It's fucking freezing.

00:47.659 --> 00:49.892
It's friggin' frigid.
You're fit for flu in February

00:49.926 --> 00:52.592
without fleece, flannel,
full‐fledged furnace, or fire.

00:52.626 --> 00:53.992
‐Go on...
‐It's goddamn glacial,

00:54.026 --> 00:56.659
go grab gloves or garb and
gear up for gusts.

00:56.692 --> 00:58.459
‐Hear ya...
‐Hypothermia,

00:58.492 --> 01:00.059
if you don't heat your home
to half hellish it's harsh.

hot chocolate,

01:01.792 --> 01:03.026

01:03.059 --> 01:04.959
‐Infinitely icy...
‐Inhabit indoors.

01:04.992 --> 01:06.492
Isolated and insulated.

01:06.526 --> 01:08.659
Incubate the igloo.
Illness is an issue.

01:08.692 --> 01:11.126
Influenzas implied.
Infections imminent.

01:11.159 --> 01:12.859
Immunity is impossible.

01:19.159 --> 01:21.092
‐Just joking...
‐Ah, just joshin' jargon.

01:21.126 --> 01:23.592
It ain't jail. Jackets in
January's no jigsaw.

01:23.626 --> 01:25.192
‐Keep calm...
‐Killjoys keep comfy

01:25.226 --> 01:27.192
in their kingdom,
crashing kilos of Kleenex,

01:27.226 --> 01:29.126
keen for cozy kayaking
with their kids

01:29.159 --> 01:31.092
when the key is killing kegs
with your kin.

01:31.126 --> 01:32.759
‐Literally...
‐Losers live life

01:32.792 --> 01:34.859
locked in their layers,
lingering lazy and lifeless,

01:34.892 --> 01:36.492
lost like legit loners,

01:36.526 --> 01:38.092
while the leaders in
larger learning let loose.

‐Nature.

01:50.726 --> 01:52.692
Naturally nippy, but that's
nothin' new up north.

01:52.726 --> 01:55.026
Normal naturistic narrative.
Not national news.

01:55.059 --> 01:56.492
‐Overcast.
‐Overcoats and

01:56.526 --> 01:58.159
‐overshoes, obviously.
‐Polar.

01:58.192 --> 02:00.226
Parkas and pullovers,
particularily.

02:00.259 --> 02:02.226
‐Tried quail?
‐A quantity of quality quilts

02:02.259 --> 02:03.992
is quaint and
quasi‐quintessential

02:04.026 --> 02:06.026
to avoid quivering
and quash quarrelling

02:06.059 --> 02:07.959
if quarantined to
one's quarters. Try quail.

‐Well, not raw rookie.

Rudolph's red nose.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.692
‐Sleddin'.
‐So, we're sound.

02:15.726 --> 02:17.226
Sled's a synonym
for snowmobiles.

02:17.259 --> 02:19.059
Snowmobile's a
synonym for sled.

02:19.092 --> 02:22.726
So, a sled is a snowmobile,
a snowmobile is a sled. Super?

02:30.259 --> 02:31.992
‐Terrific.
‐Trust a traditional

02:32.026 --> 02:34.592
turtleneck to maintain a
toasty temperature over time.

02:34.626 --> 02:35.659
‐Ugly.
‐Useful.

‐Vile.
‐Valuable.

‐Whatever.
‐Whiteouts and wind chills,

wake up, wankers.

Wrathful wicked weather.

02:42.859 --> 02:45.059

Warm your wet
workwear by the woodstove.

02:47.126 --> 02:49.626
Winter is wonderful,

‐Exceptionally.

‐Yup.
‐Yeah.

06:42.992 --> 06:44.459
Hey, Dary, you ever had

You ever had

‐That's eels.

the best sashimis.

07:11.859 --> 07:14.226
Well, the Japanese call the
bluefin tunas maguro tunas,

that they use in sushis.

07:17.026 --> 07:18.526
Yeah, but toro is a
more expensive tuna but

07:18.559 --> 07:19.759
it makes the best sashimis.

Hold my spitter.

09:25.059 --> 09:26.059
Hold my spitter.

10:40.792 --> 10:42.659
All right,
how're we gonna fuck this pig?

10:42.692 --> 10:44.192
Well, you're gonna wanna
starts with dimensions.

10:44.226 --> 10:46.092
‐What're you thinkin' there?
‐14‐by‐16.

10:46.126 --> 10:47.692
What, you wanna play
dodgeball in there, Dary?

10:47.726 --> 10:49.659
14‐by‐16, well,
that's five me's,

10:49.692 --> 10:51.159
five you's and five Dary's.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.026
You wanna play three team
dodgeball in there, Dan?

10:53.059 --> 10:54.626
Call it 12‐by‐14.

10:54.659 --> 10:56.192
You wanna play fuckin'
dodgeball in there, Dary.

10:56.226 --> 10:57.826
12‐by‐14.

10:57.859 --> 10:59.659
That's four me's,
four you's and four Dary's.

10:59.692 --> 11:01.092
You wanna play two‐team
dodgeball with

11:01.126 --> 11:02.692
one sub each in there, Dan?

11:02.726 --> 11:03.826
How about 8‐by‐10?

11:06.692 --> 11:08.192
Well, I'd fuck with
8‐by‐10.

11:08.226 --> 11:10.126
No, you're not playin' no
dodgeball in no 8‐by‐10s.

11:10.159 --> 11:11.826
I never wanted to play no
dodgeball in no 8‐by‐10.

11:11.859 --> 11:13.792
Oh, I got so much time
for 8‐by‐10.

11:13.826 --> 11:15.659
8‐by‐10,
that's three me's,

11:15.692 --> 11:17.226
three you's and two Dary's.

11:17.259 --> 11:18.892
‐Comfortably?
‐You're cozy.

11:18.926 --> 11:20.059
Plus some
wiggle room in there.

11:20.092 --> 11:21.559
Call it 8‐by‐10.

11:21.592 --> 11:22.959
Call it a Texas size 10‐4,
good buddy.

11:25.592 --> 11:27.526
Show you how we're gonna
have the structure.

11:27.559 --> 11:28.792
What we're gonna do is put a

11:28.826 --> 11:30.959
space heater here,
mini fridge here.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.592
Gonna throw the
genny right out there.

11:34.626 --> 11:36.826
What about the
sushis and sashimis?

11:36.859 --> 11:38.026
‐Hey!
‐(DOOR OPENS)

11:39.559 --> 11:40.926

11:42.492 --> 11:43.826
‐Good, and you?
‐Not so bad.

11:43.859 --> 11:45.192
You fuckin' serious
with that turtleneck?

11:45.226 --> 11:46.592
Lose a lot a heat in the neck.

11:46.626 --> 11:47.792
You fuckin' serious
with that hair?

11:47.826 --> 11:49.459
‐Figure it out.
‐You figure it out.

11:49.492 --> 11:50.626
Where you's been?

11:50.659 --> 11:51.792
‐Modeling.
‐How's that for you?

11:51.826 --> 11:53.059
‐Boring.
‐Okay.

11:53.092 --> 11:54.526
There's no money in it.

11:54.559 --> 11:55.926
‐Way she goes.
‐A monkey could do it.

11:55.959 --> 11:57.726
‐Good enough.
‐Missed sleddin' season, too.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.092
I told you she'd miss
sleddin' season.

11:59.126 --> 12:00.692
I was the one who said
she'd figure it out.

12:00.726 --> 12:02.626
‐You figure it out.
‐You figure it out.

12:02.659 --> 12:03.759
Where's your shits?

12:03.792 --> 12:04.959
About that...

12:08.626 --> 12:09.859
These are...

12:09.892 --> 12:11.026
My friends.

12:11.059 --> 12:13.492
Well, what are your
friends named?

12:14.192 --> 12:16.726
Shep and Kingsley.

12:16.759 --> 12:18.992
‐Those are dude's names?
‐Yeah.

12:19.026 --> 12:20.192
They sound like dog names.

12:20.226 --> 12:21.859
I don't like
where this is goin'.

12:21.892 --> 12:22.959
We'll be in my room.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.459
Guys, hang up your coats.

12:33.492 --> 12:34.792
Where's your
fuckin' shirt, Shep?

12:34.826 --> 12:36.959
Where the fuck is
your shirt, Kingsley?

12:36.992 --> 12:38.459
‐It ripped.
‐It ripped?

12:38.492 --> 12:40.459
‐Mine too.
‐How?

12:40.492 --> 12:42.192
'Cause I'm so fat.

12:42.226 --> 12:43.959
Me too, I'm so fat.

12:43.992 --> 12:45.126
I'm a bat fastard.

12:45.159 --> 12:47.059
‐I'm a fat podger.
‐Guys...

12:47.092 --> 12:48.826
Enough, let's go.

12:48.859 --> 12:51.159
If I was a Dr. Seuss book
I'd be The Fat in the Hat.

12:51.192 --> 12:53.792
If I was an arcade fighting
game I'd be Mortal Komfat.

12:53.826 --> 12:55.459
If I was one of the
five boroughs in New York City

12:55.492 --> 12:56.959
I'd be the Fatten Island.

12:56.992 --> 12:58.792
If I was an Italian city‐state
I'd be the Fatican.

12:58.826 --> 12:59.959
Put a fuckin' shirt on!

13:10.592 --> 13:12.759
I don't know what happened
to you dusters,

13:12.792 --> 13:17.226
but, fuck me, do you fuck dog!

13:17.259 --> 13:18.726
Walkin' around poutin' like

13:18.759 --> 13:20.959
your little sister
took your last Oreo.

13:20.992 --> 13:22.559
And not a traditional Oreo,

13:22.592 --> 13:26.059
no, a limited edition Oreo,
or seasonal Oreo

13:26.092 --> 13:28.926
they're gonna take off
the shelf for another year.

13:28.959 --> 13:30.626
Hey, Barts,

13:30.659 --> 13:34.926
did little Natiesha take
your last Halloween Oreo?

13:34.959 --> 13:36.592
You didn't get a chance to say

13:36.626 --> 13:40.092
goodbye to that
delicious orange frosting?

13:40.126 --> 13:42.492
What about you, Yorkie? Huh?

13:42.526 --> 13:43.692
Did little Tamsyn take your

13:43.726 --> 13:46.159
last Reese's
Peanut Butter Cup Oreo?

13:46.192 --> 13:47.959
Well, it gets worse.

13:47.992 --> 13:51.592
Those have been
discontinued forever.

13:51.626 --> 13:53.559
What about you, Scholtzy, huh?

13:53.592 --> 13:54.892
Did little Tay'Rhonda

13:54.926 --> 13:57.592
take your last Ice Cream
Oreo Orange Sherbet?

13:57.626 --> 13:59.826
That is a summertime flavor.

13:59.859 --> 14:01.092
Good luck suckin' back on

14:01.126 --> 14:03.459
one of those in the
next six months.

14:04.692 --> 14:05.892
Fisky, I know.

14:05.926 --> 14:07.826
You're a Birthday
Cream Fudge guy.

14:07.859 --> 14:09.859
They're all gone. What?

14:09.892 --> 14:11.659
Little DeSondra
was the culprit.

14:11.692 --> 14:13.559
And her pal LarawnShawn

14:13.592 --> 14:17.092
took the last Heads or
Tails Mega Stuff, too!

14:18.492 --> 14:20.159
Hey, Boomtown.
You're an only child.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.226
You got your
NASCAR Daytona Oreos?

14:22.259 --> 14:25.826
It's fucking embarrassing!

14:25.859 --> 14:27.592
Let me give you some
advice, donkeys.

14:27.626 --> 14:31.026
Take a page out of
Jonesy and Reilly's book.

14:37.759 --> 14:41.792
My boys, I skipped curfew call
for you last night 'cause

14:41.826 --> 14:43.459
I knew you'd be doin' legs,

14:43.492 --> 14:44.759
and I didn't want
to interrupt.

14:44.792 --> 14:45.892
We've been doin' legs
two‐a‐days since

14:45.926 --> 14:47.126
the first week
of summer, Coach.

14:47.159 --> 14:48.526
Blocked every wheelchair ramp

14:48.559 --> 14:50.459
in the arena so
we'd have to do stairs.

14:50.492 --> 14:51.959
Tenacity.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.826
You can't teach that.

14:53.859 --> 14:55.859
You know, I never thought
those pheasants

14:55.892 --> 15:01.959
would fuck the dog so hard

15:01.992 --> 15:03.959
that you two would become
my studs!

15:03.992 --> 15:05.159
‐Thanks, Coach.
‐Thanks, Coach.

15:05.192 --> 15:07.459
Well, I need one win.

15:08.792 --> 15:11.826
One W.

15:11.859 --> 15:13.559
What are you gonna do
to get me that?

15:13.592 --> 15:14.692
‐Selfish hockey.
‐Selfish hockey.

15:14.726 --> 15:17.226
That's right. Selfish hockey!

15:17.259 --> 15:18.692
Break it down.

15:18.726 --> 15:20.192
Skate the puck. Don't pass it.

15:20.226 --> 15:21.692
Head man's still gonna be
there when you catch up.

15:21.726 --> 15:23.226
Take it coast‐to‐coast.

15:23.259 --> 15:25.126
Shots from poor angles
are still shots.

15:25.159 --> 15:26.659
Buck and a half,
two‐minute shifts,

15:26.692 --> 15:28.026
three minutes even.

15:28.059 --> 15:29.226
Cruise the blue line
to catch your breath.

15:29.259 --> 15:30.759
Bad bounce,
that's a good breakaway.

15:30.792 --> 15:33.026
‐Gotta get the bounces, boys.
‐Perfect.

15:33.059 --> 15:35.192
And a retaliation penalty
never hurt anyone.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.792
What's our mantra?

15:36.826 --> 15:38.892
BOTH: They don't ask how,
they ask how many.

15:38.926 --> 15:39.926
That's right.

15:42.759 --> 15:44.626
What did I tell you
about stick tape?

15:45.892 --> 15:49.492
You don't need it!

15:51.259 --> 15:53.492
The only people that'll be
worrying about puck handling

15:53.526 --> 15:55.092
are Jonesy and Reilly!

15:55.126 --> 15:56.826
Save it for them! Huh?

15:58.726 --> 16:00.992
W!

16:04.626 --> 16:06.726
Well, let's fuck this pig.

16:07.859 --> 16:09.092

16:09.126 --> 16:10.592
Pretty good spot
for pissin' over there.

16:10.626 --> 16:12.992
Pissin' outside's for
dogs and degens.

16:13.026 --> 16:14.859
I piss outside
as much as the dog does.

16:14.892 --> 16:16.726
Well, I'm not above it either.
I'm just sayin'.

16:16.759 --> 16:18.992
Fuck, we could really use some
kind of bar in this town, eh?

‐Big brother.

‐Good and you?

16:26.259 --> 16:27.526
‐Not so bad.
‐My friends need

16:27.559 --> 16:28.659
to borrow clothes.

16:28.692 --> 16:30.192
Give 'em barn clothes.

16:30.226 --> 16:31.626
I won't have barn clothes
in the house. They stink.

16:31.659 --> 16:32.592
Guess you have to
put your friends

16:32.626 --> 16:33.959
in the fuckin' barn then.

16:33.992 --> 16:35.159
They don't have any clothes
of their own.

16:35.192 --> 16:36.926
‐Okay.
‐They don't have any money.

16:36.959 --> 16:38.959
‐Way she goes.
‐Models are always broke.

16:38.992 --> 16:40.692
‐Good enough.
‐You have a baker's dozen

16:40.726 --> 16:42.159
plaid shirts.
They only need two.

16:44.659 --> 16:45.792
Give them the hand‐me‐downs

16:45.826 --> 16:46.926
I got from
Dan's second cousin.

16:46.959 --> 16:48.792
‐Who, Garrett?
‐No, Jarrett.

16:48.826 --> 16:50.059
‐10‐4.
‐Over and out.

16:55.026 --> 16:56.592
These are the
only ones that fit.

16:56.626 --> 16:58.992
‐'Cause we're too podgey.
‐Ugh, don't start.

16:59.026 --> 17:00.492
If I was a major league
baseball team

17:00.526 --> 17:01.992
I'd be the L. A. Podgers.

If I was a major league

17:03.626 --> 17:04.926
I'd be Podger Clemens.

I'd be a Podge Ram.

If I was a disguising

17:08.859 --> 17:10.559

I'd be camou‐podge.

17:10.592 --> 17:11.992
No, better without the shirts.

17:18.192 --> 17:22.459

ultra‐competitive gaming

18:13.726 --> 18:15.692
laced with hip‐hop karaoke.

18:15.726 --> 18:18.026
Add a dash of
late‐night loitering

18:18.059 --> 18:19.826

18:32.492 --> 18:34.859

18:34.892 --> 18:36.692
He called it two‐bit.

18:36.726 --> 18:39.092
Shabby. Shoestring.

18:39.126 --> 18:41.026
Mmm, hence the term,

Don't be redundant.

18:43.726 --> 18:44.726

18:46.259 --> 18:47.459
he did hate that.

18:49.659 --> 18:51.126
This was his.

18:54.226 --> 18:55.759
Yeah.

20:09.292 --> 20:11.992
Went up faster than shit
through a goose, too.

20:12.026 --> 20:13.626
‐Lickety‐split.
‐Real nice of Tyson and

20:13.659 --> 20:14.692
Joint Boys to help us out.

20:14.726 --> 20:16.492
More hands make less work.

20:18.192 --> 20:20.026
ALL: Welp...

20:20.059 --> 20:21.392
Fire up the genny, Gary.

20:29.392 --> 20:31.192
(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

20:34.492 --> 20:36.659
Now test out the
motion sensor, Dan.

20:42.192 --> 20:44.392
‐Boss, man...
‐I appreciates this.

20:44.426 --> 20:45.992
Aw, it's tits.

20:46.026 --> 20:49.026
‐Well, there's one step left.
‐Yeah!

20:49.059 --> 20:50.426
‐Christen it?
‐Should we christen it?

20:50.459 --> 20:51.592
Well, are we
gonna christen it?

20:51.626 --> 20:52.992
Should we christen it?

20:53.026 --> 20:54.592
I feel like we should be
christening it.

20:54.626 --> 20:55.992
Well, I'm surprised we're not
christening it right now.

21:03.459 --> 21:06.259
‐Gordie Howe hat trick, ferda.
‐Game puck goes to Gordie.

21:06.292 --> 21:08.126
Yeah. I had 18 shots
on net, boys.

21:08.159 --> 21:09.326
Ovechkin numbers.

21:09.359 --> 21:10.726
Played no less than
38 minutes.

21:10.759 --> 21:12.426
Duncan Keith numbers.

21:12.459 --> 21:15.492
But, uh, 9‐4 ferda.

21:15.526 --> 21:17.559
Ferda other team.

21:17.592 --> 21:20.026
You know, it's sick,
unreal stats.

21:20.059 --> 21:21.559
But, uh...

21:21.592 --> 21:24.026
Be nice to have
a couple of W's, too.

21:24.059 --> 21:25.426
Be nice to have "a" W.

21:26.526 --> 21:28.092
Players only meeting?

21:28.126 --> 21:29.459
Yeah. Coach is right,

21:29.492 --> 21:31.392
I mean, no W's on the season
that's just...

21:31.426 --> 21:34.092
‐Fucking embarrassing!
‐Coach.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.126
Players only meeting.

21:36.159 --> 21:38.059
Oh. Well, that's embarrassing.

21:46.059 --> 21:47.692
Jesus.

21:47.726 --> 21:50.559
All right you pheasants,
what's the problem?

21:50.592 --> 21:51.992
Spill it, pheasys.

21:52.026 --> 21:54.126
My wife left me,
you little bitch!

21:54.159 --> 21:55.492
Feels like someone ran
a coarse glove hustle

21:55.526 --> 21:57.626
on my love muscle. Yorkie?

21:57.659 --> 21:59.292
Same, Barts.
Feels like someone

21:59.326 --> 22:02.026
fork‐gored my
pork sword. Scholtzy?

22:02.059 --> 22:03.626
She's gone.

22:03.659 --> 22:05.426
Feels like someone took
a big snackers on

22:05.459 --> 22:08.659
my little knackers.
Pussy. Fisky.

22:09.526 --> 22:11.259
Out the door.

22:11.292 --> 22:12.626
Feels like someone slammed
a super soccer kick into my

22:12.659 --> 22:15.359
Ron‐Donny long schlong.
Boomtown!

22:15.392 --> 22:17.392
I'm an only child,

22:17.426 --> 22:21.159
as Coach previously and
pitilessly pointed out.

22:21.192 --> 22:24.726
I'd kill for a little
Natiesha, Tamsyn, Tay'Rhonda,

22:24.759 --> 22:28.092
DeSondra,
LarawnShawn, in my life.

22:28.126 --> 22:32.159
But someone did steal my last
NASCAR Daytona Oreo!

22:32.192 --> 22:34.159
That wasn't funny!

22:34.192 --> 22:37.159
But, you all love your wives.

22:37.192 --> 22:38.926
‐What happened, boys?
‐(DOOR OPENS)

22:41.059 --> 22:43.026
‐BOTH: Angie?
‐Boys.

22:43.059 --> 22:44.559
Unreal game.

22:44.592 --> 22:47.559
Who wants to
take me out for a sando?

22:47.592 --> 22:49.059
I'll let you work it out.

22:52.059 --> 22:53.192
BOTH: Angie?

22:53.226 --> 22:55.392
That's my girl,
you little bitch.

22:55.426 --> 22:57.526
She makes me want to rub
slick on my disco stick.

22:57.559 --> 22:58.692
Yorkie?

22:58.726 --> 23:00.326
Correction, Barts. She's mine.

23:00.359 --> 23:01.526
She makes me wanna go
Warcraft

23:01.559 --> 23:04.126
all over my man shaft.
Scholtzy.

23:04.159 --> 23:05.726
Mine.

23:05.759 --> 23:09.026
She makes me wanna take a
low fiver to my deep‐V diver.

23:09.059 --> 23:11.426
Pussy. Fisky?

23:11.459 --> 23:13.259
Uh‐uh. She's mine.

23:13.292 --> 23:15.959
She makes me wanna take a
fresh fruit to my flesh flute.

23:15.992 --> 23:17.159
Boomtown!

23:17.192 --> 23:19.059
You all have sisters.

23:20.159 --> 23:21.326
I hope you're kind to them.

23:22.659 --> 23:24.326
I hope you cherish them.

23:25.459 --> 23:27.059
This one's mine!

23:27.692 --> 23:28.692
(GRUNTING)

23:30.192 --> 23:31.426
This is bad, buddy.

23:31.459 --> 23:33.459
This is really bad, buddy.

23:33.492 --> 23:35.459
I think we've got...

23:35.492 --> 23:36.592
BOTH: A puck bunny.

23:51.592 --> 23:52.959
DAN: It looks darker
out here

23:52.992 --> 23:54.192
than the inside of
a fuel tank.

23:54.226 --> 23:55.426
Head towards
the sensor light, Dan.

24:01.726 --> 24:03.992
I don't appreciates this.

24:04.026 --> 24:07.559
Well, how we
gonna fuck this pig?

24:07.592 --> 24:09.459
We find who did it.

24:11.659 --> 24:13.259
And we beat the
shit out of them.
