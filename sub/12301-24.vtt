00:18.682 --> 00:20.362
Kyle, come on.

00:20.362 --> 00:22.657
- Once is enough.
- One more time.

00:22.657 --> 00:25.096
You might like it.

00:25.096 --> 00:28.255
Ah, come on baby,
it won't take that long.

00:31.697 --> 00:34.072
Wait, wait.

00:34.072 --> 00:36.167
What is that?

00:37.659 --> 00:40.523
- It's your phone, let it ring.
- No, no, I turned mine off.

00:40.523 --> 00:42.372
Stop!

00:59.227 --> 01:00.817
Oh my God.

01:00.817 --> 01:03.062
Oh my God, oh my god!

01:11.178 --> 01:12.494
Are you all right?

01:12.494 --> 01:16.020
Yeah, just can't believe
she was lying there the whole time.

01:16.020 --> 01:18.484
Did you touch anything
else besides the cellphone?

01:18.484 --> 01:22.080
No way, we were freaked.
We called 911 the moment we saw her.

01:22.080 --> 01:25.689
Yeah, on my cell. / Good.

01:25.813 --> 01:28.769
Would you mind sticking around,
so I can get a complete statement?

01:28.769 --> 01:30.184
Yeah sure, whatever you need.

01:30.184 --> 01:32.126
Thank you.

01:33.417 --> 01:34.592
You got an ID?

01:34.592 --> 01:37.429
Waiting on Alexx
to check her effects.

01:37.429 --> 01:40.076
Caucasian, early twenties,
no handbag.

01:40.076 --> 01:42.344
Significant impressions
around her body though,

01:42.344 --> 01:43.891
she might have been dumped.

01:43.891 --> 01:45.121
Those two find her?

01:45.121 --> 01:47.527
Yes, college kids
from uh, Florida U.

01:47.527 --> 01:49.474
They heard a cell phone ring.

01:49.474 --> 01:52.163
So I'm gonna look
into who made that call.

01:52.163 --> 01:55.427
May tell us who she is. / We may
have been beaten to the punch.

01:55.427 --> 01:58.644
Ten uniforms at a crime scene,
that seems excessive.

01:58.644 --> 02:00.820
Excuse me.

02:00.940 --> 02:03.542
We're gonna have
to block up another twenty.

02:03.542 --> 02:04.946
Lieutenant.

02:04.946 --> 02:07.104
We have a VIP situation here.

02:07.104 --> 02:10.086
She's, uh, actually
an actress lieutenant.

02:10.086 --> 02:11.228
What's her name?

02:11.228 --> 02:14.246
Ashley Anders,
she does pay-per-view, dvds.

02:14.246 --> 02:16.644
Responding officers
recognized her from her films.

02:16.644 --> 02:18.329
So she does adult films.

02:18.329 --> 02:20.756
Yes sir, she's a porn star.

02:20.756 --> 02:23.061
She's also,

02:23.061 --> 02:25.289
somebody's daughter,

02:25.289 --> 02:26.745
and that,

02:26.745 --> 02:28.495
is what we focus on.

03:03.809 --> 03:06.769
MIAMI
2x24 Innocent

03:25.510 --> 03:27.622
Something in her hair Alexx.

03:27.622 --> 03:30.692
Sticky substance.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.369
Doesn't look like a biological.

03:35.369 --> 03:37.205
All right, I'll get it to trace.

03:37.205 --> 03:40.791
In the mean time
we've got keys, an mp3 player,

03:40.791 --> 03:43.091
and twenty dollars
that we found in her pocket.

03:43.091 --> 03:44.547
So I guess that rules out robbery.

03:44.547 --> 03:49.537
I think this rules out robbery.
Hand marks on her neck.

03:49.984 --> 03:51.696
Petechial hemorrhage.

03:51.696 --> 03:53.231
She was strangled.

03:53.231 --> 03:54.340
Looking that way.

03:54.340 --> 03:57.817
So the killer was up close and
personal, may be someone she knew.

03:57.817 --> 03:59.205
More than likely.

03:59.205 --> 04:02.503
The thing is, a lot of
people knew Ashley Anders.

04:02.503 --> 04:07.379
She had one of the top-selling
dvds in the adult market.

04:07.753 --> 04:09.998
I've heard.

04:10.245 --> 04:12.447
Well if this was a sex crime,
something doesn't add up.

04:12.447 --> 04:14.759
Vic is fully clothed.

04:14.759 --> 04:17.565
- May be they redressed her.
- Then they're good honey.

04:17.565 --> 04:20.577
No bunching.
It's tough to redress deadweight.

04:20.577 --> 04:22.834
I'll know more at the post.

04:26.615 --> 04:28.906
Hey. / Hi.

04:28.906 --> 04:30.062
Get anything?

04:30.062 --> 04:32.514
Well, our victim's
family lives in Minnesota,

04:32.514 --> 04:35.053
- still trying to track them down.
- What about an employer?

04:35.053 --> 04:38.610
Palm Grove industries, she's
made over a hundred films for them.

04:38.610 --> 04:40.145
Palm Grove industires?

04:39.845 --> 04:44.104
It's one of the biggest corporations in the state.
That's the David Jeffers family right?

04:44.104 --> 04:48.294
Well, must be why she's being paid by
subsidiary company called Fallen films.

04:48.294 --> 04:50.677
Fallen films,

04:50.861 --> 04:52.405
Ok. / Oh, and

04:52.405 --> 04:53.733
Horatio. / Yeah.

04:53.733 --> 04:56.445
If this case goes into Friday,

04:56.445 --> 04:58.138
um, I'll have Hagan fill in for me.

04:58.138 --> 04:59.378
- Is that all right?
- You ok?

04:59.378 --> 05:01.834
Oh yeah, I just um,

05:01.834 --> 05:04.660
have plans for the weekend.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.877
Um, no it's fine.

05:11.877 --> 05:13.276
Ok good. / Sure.

05:13.276 --> 05:15.257
Thanks. / Yeah.

05:16.224 --> 05:20.098
¢Ý SiaÀÇ 'Breathe me' ¢Ý

05:20.098 --> 05:28.063
¢Ý Help I have done it again ¢Ý

05:28.063 --> 05:36.071
¢Ý I have been here many times before ¢Ý

05:36.071 --> 05:44.106
¢Ý Hurt myself again today ¢Ý

05:44.106 --> 05:53.113
¢Ý And the worst part is
there's no one else to blame ¢Ý

05:53.113 --> 05:58.360
¢Ý be my friend ¢Ý

05:59.028 --> 06:05.021
¢Ý hold Me, wrap me up ¢Ý

06:06.704 --> 06:14.694
¢Ý unfold me, I am small ¢Ý

06:14.694 --> 06:22.620
¢Ý and needy warm me up ¢Ý

06:22.620 --> 06:28.054
¢Ý and breathe me ¢Ý

06:28.054 --> 06:31.834
Make up off, she looks
like the girl next door.

06:31.834 --> 06:33.269
Physical findings?

06:33.269 --> 06:35.468
No vaginal injuries,
I collected a kit.

06:35.468 --> 06:37.659
Doesn't appear to
be any biological fluids.

06:37.659 --> 06:39.048
COD, Alexx?

06:39.048 --> 06:41.814
Asphyxiation caused
by manual strangulation.

06:41.814 --> 06:44.853
Killer on top, used both hands.

06:51.339 --> 06:56.023
- You scraped under her finger nails?
- I sent the scrapings to trace.

06:56.239 --> 06:58.152
Okay, time of death.

06:58.152 --> 07:01.047
Rigor mortis puts the time of
death about ten to twelve hours ago,

07:01.047 --> 07:05.718
but I may be able to tell you
where she was couple of hours before.

07:05.718 --> 07:07.667
Stomach contents.

07:07.667 --> 07:09.472
Look what's at the bottom.

07:09.472 --> 07:11.314
Looks like caviar.

07:11.314 --> 07:12.908
I'm guessing Russian.

07:12.908 --> 07:14.678
200 bucks a spoon-full?

07:14.678 --> 07:17.777
She was at a party
or a club of some kind.

07:17.777 --> 07:21.672
Okay, I'll have Yelina take a look.
Thank you Alexx.

07:22.898 --> 07:25.728
Hey, What's this about?
The evidence hasn't been logged yet.

07:25.728 --> 07:28.596
Oh, I'm sorry.
Dad I've gotta go.

07:28.596 --> 07:31.682
The Savannah, I'll
see you there, I promise.

07:31.682 --> 07:34.610
Trace said you had the finger
nail scrapings from our porn girl.

07:34.610 --> 07:36.604
It's in here somewhere.

07:36.604 --> 07:38.546
You ever seen any
Ashley Anders movies?

07:38.546 --> 07:40.641
Me? No.
Where would I see'em?

07:40.641 --> 07:43.879
Oh, clubs, parties, you know, out.

07:43.879 --> 07:47.485
No, I don't think you and I are going
to the same places Valera.

07:47.485 --> 07:49.340
Porns that do martini.

07:49.340 --> 07:51.562
No one's hiding their vices anymore.

07:51.562 --> 07:53.813
Here it is.

07:54.542 --> 07:58.678
Blood and tissue under our
victim's nails is from a David Jeffers.

07:58.678 --> 08:00.765
Palm Grove's David Jeffers?

08:00.765 --> 08:03.016
He's the CEO that
distributes Ashley's movies.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.808
I know. Ran
Mr. Upstanding through CODIS.

08:05.808 --> 08:08.436
He's in the system for a stat
rape back in grad school.

08:08.436 --> 08:11.379
Ah, that makes him
a registered sex offender.

08:11.379 --> 08:13.851
I wonder if it took place in a park.

08:13.851 --> 08:17.288
Matter of fact it did.
Biscayne.

08:19.992 --> 08:24.024
Mr. Jeffers, this is about
one of your employees, Ashley Anders.

08:24.024 --> 08:26.868
She was murdered last night.

08:29.786 --> 08:33.155
that's terrible, but I don't
know anything about this girl.

08:33.155 --> 08:35.467
My client owns
a conglomerate of businesses,

08:35.467 --> 08:38.187
one of which happens
to distribute adult titles.

08:38.187 --> 08:40.455
It's assuming a lot to think he knows
each employee personally.

08:40.455 --> 08:42.390
Oh, CSIs never assume.

08:42.390 --> 08:46.314
We found your DNA under
the dead girl's finger nails, Mr. Jeffers.

08:46.314 --> 08:50.675
So, what happened? Did things get
a little rough after the party last night?

08:50.675 --> 08:52.465
A party?

08:52.465 --> 08:54.584
I checked your security log.

08:54.584 --> 08:57.239
Very informative.

08:57.239 --> 09:00.814
Ashley attended your
party at this very office, last night.

09:00.814 --> 09:05.009
She had champagne,
caviar and got strangled.

09:05.207 --> 09:08.934
So, you two wanna step outside
while we execute the warrant?

09:08.934 --> 09:12.181
It'll be my pleasure to escort you.
Gentlemen.

09:32.289 --> 09:34.771
A meeting with your client Mr. Galas.

09:34.771 --> 09:36.794
A 3000...

09:37.136 --> 09:39.590
They said the jet'll be refueled by

09:39.773 --> 09:41.800
Relax David, we don't have to panic.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.270
Don't tell me not to panic.

09:43.270 --> 09:45.069
That bitch screwed us.
It's under control.

09:45.069 --> 09:46.265
The hell it is.

09:46.265 --> 09:49.152
Take care of the Ashley
situation or it's your ass.

09:52.817 --> 09:54.981
That was a business discussion.

09:54.981 --> 09:56.769
It's protected
by attorney-client privilege.

09:56.769 --> 10:00.221
A judge may not see it that way,

10:00.221 --> 10:02.354
- in a murder case.
- I didn't murder anyone.

10:02.354 --> 10:04.964
You don't have to say anything David.

10:04.964 --> 10:06.411
I've got nothing to hide.

10:06.411 --> 10:09.878
You were with Ashley
last night weren't you?

10:10.568 --> 10:13.517
I was entertaining some clients and

10:13.517 --> 10:18.317
I decided to invites some girls to come
on over you know, to spice up the party.

10:25.100 --> 10:28.178
Ashley decided she wanted to leave.

10:28.178 --> 10:32.388
I told her I sign your movies,
you'd better damn well sell my clients.

10:33.487 --> 10:34.614
- I'm sick of this. - You're not going anywhere.

10:34.614 --> 10:36.084
- I can't do this anymore.
- You leave when I say.

10:36.084 --> 10:38.406
- You can't stop me.
- The heck I can't.

10:41.328 --> 10:43.771
She scratched my neck, she left,
that's all that happened.

10:43.771 --> 10:47.648
My client is a prominent businessman
with strong ties to the community.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.894
He has a family and three little girls.

10:49.894 --> 10:53.897
Will they be appearing in your
films Mr. Jeffers when they grow up?

10:53.897 --> 10:56.630
Just out of curiosity.

11:00.754 --> 11:02.871
These actresses have free will.

11:02.871 --> 11:06.457
Besides, it's not like we do gonzo porn,
we have story lines, we have plots.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.636
You are a regular Paddy Chayefsky

11:08.636 --> 11:11.825
- Are you arresting my client?
- Not at present.

11:20.454 --> 11:22.845
Take care of this Ashley
business or it's your ass

11:22.845 --> 11:25.753
Relax David,
we don't have to panic.

12:04.622 --> 12:06.811
Eric, what happened?

12:06.811 --> 12:09.771
Made a spill,
concentrated hydrochloric acid.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.419
What did we lose?

12:11.419 --> 12:13.178
Jeffer's answering machine tape.

12:13.178 --> 12:15.226
I was duping it for the courts,

12:15.226 --> 12:17.581
and the concentrated HCL fumes

12:17.581 --> 12:20.260
ruined the Ferric oxide powder that
coats the tape's polliment back.

12:20.260 --> 12:22.742
So the tape is spoiled.
Is it salvageable?

12:22.742 --> 12:24.042
Lietenant Caine,

12:24.042 --> 12:29.708
do you really think the CSI responsible for destorying
the original evidence should be assigned to the case?

12:29.708 --> 12:32.192
I don't remember
asking your opinion Rick.

12:32.192 --> 12:35.115
Well the commander suggested
I may be should check into this.

12:35.115 --> 12:37.506
Find out how
this accident occurred,

12:37.506 --> 12:41.455
and which employee may be involved
in undermining a major murder investigation,

12:41.455 --> 12:44.767
not to mention compromising
countless other cases.

12:44.767 --> 12:46.522
It is uh, Delko right?

12:46.522 --> 12:49.086
Eric would you give
us a minute please?

12:49.086 --> 12:50.776
Sure H.

12:52.024 --> 12:56.095
H, see that could be interpreted
as a lack of respect for a superior.

12:56.095 --> 12:59.477
You know I am willing
to take that chance.

12:59.477 --> 13:02.221
So as his superior,
did Delko screw up?

13:02.221 --> 13:05.047
No, if anybody did, I did.

13:05.047 --> 13:07.899
You did, ha, you weren't
even in the building at that time.

13:07.899 --> 13:10.097
Yelina said you were at the PD.

13:10.097 --> 13:13.304
My lab, my oversight.

13:13.304 --> 13:16.013
You cover up a lot of
people's screw ups don't ya?

13:16.013 --> 13:19.970
Delko and evidence,
your brother and that girl.

13:19.970 --> 13:22.033
What was her name, Susy right?

13:22.033 --> 13:24.405
Rick, that is a private matter.

13:24.405 --> 13:28.919
You see, I see a pattern of you withholding
critical information and I've opened a file on you.

13:28.919 --> 13:30.279
Walk away.

13:30.279 --> 13:32.966
You ran an outside
DNA check through our lab.

13:32.966 --> 13:35.421
That sample was related to the case.

13:35.421 --> 13:37.849
Yes, but that makes
it department business.

13:37.849 --> 13:40.206
And by the way, Susy right?

13:40.206 --> 13:42.504
Her kid, little Madison,

13:42.504 --> 13:43.865
it's your brother's kid.

13:43.865 --> 13:47.930
How long are you
gonna hide that from Yelina?

13:48.233 --> 13:50.864
Rick, this is...

13:50.864 --> 13:53.241
an unwise course
of action for you.

13:53.241 --> 13:55.590
That a threat?

13:58.146 --> 14:01.579
Just remember what I said.

14:01.579 --> 14:06.287
And another criminalist
will be doing this investigation.

14:09.211 --> 14:11.872
You better find more
evidence on Jeffers.

14:22.554 --> 14:25.731
Blonda Palousa?

14:26.951 --> 14:28.830
28 Lays later?

14:28.830 --> 14:31.349
She's gotta have her
own aisle at the video store.

14:31.349 --> 14:33.410
Yeah, Valera says she's famous.

14:33.410 --> 14:35.455
Well, Valera would know,
wouldn't she?

14:35.455 --> 14:38.191
Hey did you see that
dog bowl in the kitchen?

14:38.330 --> 14:39.863
Yeah, but no dog.

14:39.863 --> 14:41.906
I'll check the local kennels.

14:41.906 --> 14:44.843
Did you clear this side? / Yeah.

14:50.382 --> 14:53.274
I've got semen on the bed.

14:53.671 --> 14:55.329
Hmm, she is a porno star.

14:55.329 --> 14:59.253
Yeah, but the apartment manager says
she never brings guys back to her place.

14:59.253 --> 15:01.673
What about fans?

15:02.105 --> 15:04.537
Oh good, fan mail.

15:06.533 --> 15:09.610
Yeah, they're all
addressed to Ashley Anders,

15:09.610 --> 15:11.691
care Fallen films.

15:11.691 --> 15:14.705
I guess someone
figured out where she lived.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.336
Okay. I'll tell you what.

15:16.336 --> 15:20.293
I will process the letters
if you do the films.

15:20.444 --> 15:23.450
This is her most recent film.

15:23.450 --> 15:27.184
Well, anything that sheds some
light on who this girl might have been.

15:27.184 --> 15:30.665
Well then forget the films. DVD extras,

15:30.665 --> 15:34.306
these discs are backed
with them. Here's one.

15:36.209 --> 15:38.198
Oops.

15:38.726 --> 15:41.907
I think I saw something
on the setup menu.

15:43.266 --> 15:45.049
Hello.

15:45.414 --> 15:49.758
Hi, I'm Ashley Anders.
And this is all about me.

15:49.758 --> 15:52.229
I like chocolate and poetry,

15:52.229 --> 15:54.648
and long walks on the beach.

15:54.648 --> 15:59.633
I love men who can make me laugh,
and I hate mean people.

16:01.046 --> 16:06.154
Okay, Let's see.
Here is another one.

16:07.355 --> 16:10.014
So here I am walking
my dog Rufus, like I do everyday.

16:10.014 --> 16:14.285
- Wait a second, freeze that.
- it's one of my favorite things

16:15.162 --> 16:16.991
Looks like South Point Park right?

16:16.991 --> 16:18.576
Yeah, where she was killed?

16:18.576 --> 16:21.118
Well, you gotta be
local to recognize that.

16:30.081 --> 16:34.224
Ashley's fanmail from within
a hundred mile radius of from Miami.

16:34.224 --> 16:38.650
And these are the ones postmarked
closest to South Point Park.

16:38.650 --> 16:42.350
I have twelve out of thirty
letters here from the same perv.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.918
Single-spaced, teeny writing.

16:44.918 --> 16:48.672
I think we've got our stalker.
His name's Ned Ostroff.

16:48.672 --> 16:50.522
You think he licks his envelopes?

16:50.522 --> 16:52.648
I dunno, let's ask him.

16:52.648 --> 16:57.163
Well, you can ask him cuz I've gotta
go to the park and look for Ashley's dog.

16:57.163 --> 17:00.743
There's chance it was with herwhen she was attacked.

17:00.795 --> 17:02.591
See you later.

17:10.200 --> 17:14.803
DNA from the fan mail matches the
semen contribution from Ashley's bed.

17:14.803 --> 17:17.546
Contribution was neat.

17:17.546 --> 17:20.607
Thanks Valera. / Sure.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.595
What does that mean?

17:24.595 --> 17:29.669
That means that we have DNA proof you
were in Ashley Ander's apartment on her bed.

17:29.669 --> 17:31.327
It's ridiculous.

17:31.327 --> 17:32.861
I don't even know her.

17:32.861 --> 17:34.902
Well, that much I do believe.

17:34.902 --> 17:39.976
Neat contribution means
there was no mixture of fluids.

17:39.976 --> 17:42.791
You were by yourself.

17:53.522 --> 17:56.158
I just,

17:56.158 --> 17:58.382
needed to be close to her.

17:58.382 --> 18:00.930
You worked in the mailroom
at Palm Grove Industries.

18:00.930 --> 18:03.027
Wasn't that close enough?

18:03.027 --> 18:05.042
I did a search in human resources.

18:05.042 --> 18:10.751
- They confirmed your employment.
- Closest I got was boxing her DVDs.

18:10.751 --> 18:12.321
Shipping them.

18:12.321 --> 18:14.748
And introducing yourself to Mr. Jeffers.

18:14.748 --> 18:18.374
Human resources told us
that you had to be fired after that Ned.

18:18.374 --> 18:22.622
You've got a little bit of
a stalker personality, don't ya?

18:22.935 --> 18:26.421
Did Jeffers give you
a chance to redeem yourself?

18:26.421 --> 18:27.367
What?

18:27.367 --> 18:32.417
We have a recording of what appears
to be a plan to end Ashley Ander's life.

18:32.417 --> 18:35.853
Did Mr. Jeffers or his lawyer talk
you into breaking into her apartment?

18:35.853 --> 18:37.722
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

18:37.722 --> 18:39.699
Excuse me.

18:39.867 --> 18:42.051
Horatio thought you should see this.

18:42.051 --> 18:44.338
Had to wait for the
bruising to come up.

18:44.338 --> 18:46.837
Count the fingers.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.637
Not including the thumbs,

18:49.637 --> 18:52.303
four on the left, three on the right.

18:52.303 --> 18:55.100
Nine-fingered man.

18:57.108 --> 18:58.768
Birth defect or injury?

18:58.768 --> 19:00.557
Well I've got all ten.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.587
Can I go now?

19:02.683 --> 19:06.467
First, let's see if you've had
one of those fingers injured.

19:06.467 --> 19:09.550
We'll need your hand print please.

19:11.133 --> 19:13.860
If I say yes,

19:13.860 --> 19:16.405
can I see her body?

19:16.405 --> 19:18.518
Just to say goodbye.

19:18.518 --> 19:21.031
One more time.

19:24.800 --> 19:29.078
We will make every
effort to see that happen.

19:29.789 --> 19:32.633
Roll your right sleeve please.

19:41.161 --> 19:42.989
Down on the paper.

19:45.556 --> 19:47.813
Here's Ned's hand.

19:49.246 --> 19:52.408
And here's the killer.

19:59.817 --> 20:01.808
- No match.
- Are you sure?

20:01.808 --> 20:04.377
Yeah, interdigital span's too short.

20:04.377 --> 20:07.627
If they put someone up
to strangle Ashley, it wasn't Ned.

20:07.627 --> 20:10.370
Why don't we test
Jeffers or his lawyer?

20:10.370 --> 20:13.110
Yeah, I'm working on a warrant.

20:13.110 --> 20:14.576
Okay.

20:14.576 --> 20:17.342
I'll let Horatio know about old Ned.

20:33.043 --> 20:37.163
Got a hit on Tim Speedle, Eric Delko,

20:37.163 --> 20:39.104
you too lieutenant.

20:39.104 --> 20:40.907
Unidentifieds please.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.772
- Yes, one.
- Horatio, this is my investigation,

20:43.772 --> 20:46.922
Joseph, are the prints in the system?

20:47.065 --> 20:48.807
Carl Mercer.

20:48.807 --> 20:50.912
Carl Mercer's one of our trustees.

20:50.912 --> 20:52.956
- Jail trustee?
- That's correct.

20:52.956 --> 20:54.614
The county uses
them as cheap labor.

20:54.614 --> 20:57.879
You have an inmate
working in your lab?

20:57.879 --> 21:02.160
Based on the latest run of
budget cuts, I do, that's correct.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.263
Do I know you?

21:03.263 --> 21:06.035
Yeah, I'm the guy
you're trying to get fired.

21:06.170 --> 21:09.585
I don't know what you're talking about.
I just empty the trash.

21:09.585 --> 21:10.847
Really?

21:10.847 --> 21:13.458
Let me see your forearms Carl.

21:14.222 --> 21:17.730
Come on Carl, the forearms.

21:17.865 --> 21:20.689
Carl.

21:23.567 --> 21:26.015
There it is, HCL.

21:26.015 --> 21:34.284
Hydrochloric acid written there by you
to remember which acid to spill in my lab.

21:34.284 --> 21:36.333
This dude shows up at my wife's.

21:36.333 --> 21:38.270
Talked like a lawyer,

21:38.270 --> 21:43.124
she's never seen him before but
somehow he knows I'm in for another D&D.

21:43.232 --> 21:44.446
Offered to front the bail.

21:44.446 --> 21:49.729
And all you had to do was
spill acid in the lab, right?

22:11.106 --> 22:13.255
I hope your wife got money
for your new charges.

22:13.255 --> 22:15.005
No, I just spilled some stuff.

22:15.005 --> 22:18.432
That's an attempt to destroy
evidence in a murder investigation.

22:18.432 --> 22:20.768
Carl, do not feel bad.

22:20.768 --> 22:24.787
You were played by somebody who
understands the system better than you do

22:24.787 --> 22:26.633
and here's the other good news.

22:26.633 --> 22:28.766
You're not,

22:28.766 --> 22:30.554
alone.

22:30.554 --> 22:33.133
H, I'll be in the layout room.

22:33.133 --> 22:35.407
Okay Eric.

22:40.020 --> 22:42.295
I suppose I owe you an apology.

22:42.295 --> 22:45.099
The man you need to apologize to Rick.

22:45.099 --> 22:47.158
just left the room.

22:47.158 --> 22:49.244
Thank you Carl.

22:52.424 --> 22:54.278
Very cagey Counselor.

22:54.278 --> 22:56.179
Always happy to take a compliment,

22:56.179 --> 22:57.758
even when I don't know
why it's been given.

22:57.758 --> 23:01.269
How about bribing a trustee
to destroy evidence?

23:01.269 --> 23:02.293
How about that one?

23:02.293 --> 23:05.716
And knowing that the one thing
HCl fumes could destroy was tape.

23:05.716 --> 23:08.426
You must've got an A in chemistry.

23:08.426 --> 23:09.734
Are you telling me,

23:09.734 --> 23:12.171
you lost the evidence
you thought you had on my client?

23:12.171 --> 23:14.140
No, not quite.

23:14.140 --> 23:17.336
We actually made dupes for the
prosecutor and for the defense.

23:17.336 --> 23:19.976
Without the originals
you can't prove authenticity.

23:19.976 --> 23:22.492
I can argue that the copied tapes
could have been altered.

23:22.492 --> 23:25.164
Speaking of authenticity, have a listen.

23:25.164 --> 23:27.535
It's under control.
The hell it is.

23:27.535 --> 23:31.410
Take care of the Ashley
situation or it's your ass.

23:31.410 --> 23:34.113
Now the state's attorney
is going to hear that,

23:34.113 --> 23:37.693
and as you planning Ashley's murder.

23:37.693 --> 23:39.685
Not so.

23:39.685 --> 23:41.180
Really? Excuse me.

23:41.180 --> 23:44.075
Yeah. / Just hung up
with the trustee's wife.

23:44.075 --> 23:45.769
She denies the whole thing.

23:45.769 --> 23:47.829
- Interesting.
- She won't make a statement,

23:47.829 --> 23:50.287
implicating our lawyer friend here.

23:50.287 --> 23:52.936
Okay, good to know.
Thank you.

23:52.936 --> 23:54.571
Well Counselor, you just got lucky.

23:54.571 --> 23:57.046
The trustee's wife

23:57.046 --> 23:59.678
is too afraid to come forward.

23:59.678 --> 24:01.509
Don't you hate it when
the truth doesn't suit you?

24:01.509 --> 24:03.568
Not yet it doesn't,

24:03.568 --> 24:05.413
not yet.

24:17.074 --> 24:21.039
Rufus.

24:22.551 --> 24:25.662
Rufus.

24:27.691 --> 24:30.218
Rufus.

24:30.218 --> 24:32.247
Rufus!

24:32.247 --> 24:33.993
Hey excuse me miss.

24:33.993 --> 24:36.010
Are we after the same thing?

24:36.010 --> 24:37.497
Not today, all right?

24:37.497 --> 24:39.094
Just not today.

24:39.094 --> 24:40.504
Rufus.

24:40.504 --> 24:43.245
No, it's Ashley's dog right?

24:43.360 --> 24:45.504
I'm with the CSI Miami-Dade.

24:45.504 --> 24:48.597
We think the dog was with
her the night she was killed.

24:48.597 --> 24:50.757
Ash and I are best friends.

24:50.757 --> 24:52.123
Were.

24:52.123 --> 24:54.986
- We work together.
- You're in the...

24:54.986 --> 24:56.643
I work adult.

24:56.643 --> 24:59.430
Soon as I heard,
I went to Ash's place,

24:59.430 --> 25:01.455
I noticed the dog was gone. / Dude,

25:01.455 --> 25:02.859
I told you it was her.

25:02.859 --> 25:06.230
Coquey Divine,
you're that chick in the pornos.

25:06.230 --> 25:08.926
Oh no, you guys have me
confused with somebody else.

25:08.926 --> 25:11.039
No way. You're her.

25:11.039 --> 25:13.761
I'd recognize that tail anywhere.

25:13.761 --> 25:17.358
- Why don't you guys take a walk.
- What are you, her boyfriend?

25:17.358 --> 25:19.418
- You lucky man!
- Yeah buddy, hey hey

25:19.418 --> 25:22.076
how about you
let us tap some of that.

25:22.076 --> 25:23.379
I'm serious, get out of here.

25:23.379 --> 25:25.323
Yeah, why don't
I kick your ass instead.

25:25.323 --> 25:26.770
How about I arrest you,

25:26.770 --> 25:30.162
for harassing this young lady and
interfering with a murder investigation,

25:30.162 --> 25:31.464
how about that?

25:31.464 --> 25:34.026
No problem here.
We didn't mean anything, sir.

25:34.026 --> 25:35.427
I'm... I'm sorry officer.

25:35.427 --> 25:37.667
Get lost.

25:37.901 --> 25:39.362
Can I have your job?

25:39.362 --> 25:42.349
I got into the wrong business.

25:42.953 --> 25:44.818
Hey, is that him?

25:45.702 --> 25:48.222
Rufus, hey.

25:48.222 --> 25:49.748
No, don't do that.

25:49.748 --> 25:52.063
He's evidence.

25:56.824 --> 25:58.711
He's been alone for a day.

25:58.711 --> 26:00.087
He's pretty brambled up.

26:00.087 --> 26:02.064
Oh, poor boy.

26:03.704 --> 26:05.616
His ribs are sore.

26:05.616 --> 26:07.203
Tough old guy.

26:07.203 --> 26:08.916
The killer might have kicked him.

26:08.916 --> 26:10.856
Meaning?

26:10.856 --> 26:12.955
Well, maybe Rufus here,

26:12.955 --> 26:15.079
gave him a reason to.

26:15.079 --> 26:17.399
You hold his mouth open?

26:26.803 --> 26:28.509
You got any floss?

26:28.509 --> 26:30.382
Are you kidding?

26:30.382 --> 26:32.796
No.

26:35.714 --> 26:37.297
Let's hope that...

26:37.297 --> 26:39.430
he bit the guy.

26:41.831 --> 26:43.935
Horatio?

26:43.935 --> 26:45.816
Yeah.

26:45.816 --> 26:50.416
David Jeffers has a history of
hooking up with young girls, doesn't he?

26:50.416 --> 26:54.030
How old is this victim?
How old do you think she is?

26:54.345 --> 26:57.125
Ashley's real name is
Kathleen Sosenko.

26:57.125 --> 27:00.593
ID puts her 21.

27:00.593 --> 27:03.448
So does the birth certificate
we got from Jeffers' office.

27:03.448 --> 27:05.240
Let's check, okay?

27:05.240 --> 27:07.690
Wisdom teeth don't lie.

27:12.747 --> 27:14.896
Third molars haven't grown in yet.

27:14.896 --> 27:16.291
Haven't even started.

27:16.291 --> 27:19.446
Don't your wisdom teeth erupt
when you're 18 years old?

27:19.446 --> 27:22.371
Yeah, they're last to erupt.

27:26.361 --> 27:30.474
The molars are five centimeters
below the gum surface.

27:30.474 --> 27:32.599
She's 18 tops.

27:32.599 --> 27:34.100
Okay.

27:34.100 --> 27:38.923
So, she's been appearing in films
3 years which mean she started at 15.

27:38.923 --> 27:43.003
And that is what David Jeffers is hiding

27:43.848 --> 27:45.125
Hey. / Hey.

27:45.125 --> 27:47.629
- What did you get?
- Found the girl's dog,

27:47.629 --> 27:49.399
human flesh was in his teeth.

27:49.399 --> 27:52.516
What's the bad news? / Doesn't
match Jeffers' or his lawyer's.

27:52.516 --> 27:53.733
What do we do now?

27:53.733 --> 27:56.537
Go back to the park and
we take up our surveilance again.

27:56.537 --> 27:58.496
There are no camera
stations in the park.

27:58.496 --> 28:02.032
But that doesn't mean
she's not being watched.

28:02.032 --> 28:04.166
Why am I back here?

28:04.166 --> 28:06.025
You're gonna help us, Ned.

28:06.025 --> 28:08.827
I already told you,
I didn't do it.

28:08.827 --> 28:10.328
Well, first of all,

28:10.328 --> 28:12.057
everybody tells us they didn't do it.

28:12.057 --> 28:15.169
And second of all, we already
know the things you've done.

28:15.169 --> 28:16.774
And you know
everything that Ashley did.

28:16.774 --> 28:18.504
You're a bona fide stalker.

28:18.504 --> 28:20.098
Okay,

28:20.098 --> 28:21.174
you've made your point.

28:21.174 --> 28:25.070
You saw Ashley more than
anyone else in the last few days,

28:25.070 --> 28:27.785
and you also have
a breaking and entering charge

28:27.785 --> 28:30.266
I might be helpful with.

28:30.266 --> 28:32.762
I'm listening.

28:34.254 --> 28:36.883
The night Ashley was strangled,

28:36.883 --> 28:38.753
did you see this man?

28:38.753 --> 28:41.193
Her boss? Jeffers.

28:41.193 --> 28:43.240
Nah, he wasn't there.

28:43.240 --> 28:46.445
Okay. / What did you see that night?

28:46.445 --> 28:48.551
Ashley, uh...

28:48.551 --> 28:53.890
was wearing this ruby
red gloss, number 6.

28:53.890 --> 28:56.801
And the hoop earrings
that her mother gave her.

28:56.801 --> 28:59.679
- Did you see her dog?
- Rufus hates me.

28:59.679 --> 29:02.230
I keep my distance
when he's around.

29:02.230 --> 29:05.757
I took off when she
started talking to some guy.

29:06.722 --> 29:08.002
Which guy?

29:08.002 --> 29:12.025
- Who're you talking about?
- I hate seeing her talk to guys.

29:12.025 --> 29:15.490
Okay. Ned, who are you
talking about? Which guy?

29:15.490 --> 29:18.819
I just took off. I don't know.

29:18.819 --> 29:20.641
He was wearing a cap.

29:20.641 --> 29:23.266
And uh... a jacket.

29:23.266 --> 29:25.113
With a horseshoe on it.

29:25.113 --> 29:26.953
Jacket with a horseshoe?

29:26.953 --> 29:28.898
Okay.

29:34.164 --> 29:36.274
A horseshoe doesn't
really narrow it down.

29:36.274 --> 29:39.025
We've got everything
from boyscout's caps to casinos.

29:39.025 --> 29:42.667
The thing they have in common is
they are guy related activities.

29:42.667 --> 29:44.830
True.

29:46.959 --> 29:49.943
There are hundreds of'em.
I don't know where to start.

29:49.943 --> 29:55.372
Maybe we can cross-reference
it with her fan mail, we might get lucky.

29:57.192 --> 29:59.677
Maybe we just did.

30:02.484 --> 30:05.006
What if we're not looking
for a horseshoe?

30:05.006 --> 30:06.741
The Greek letter omega.

30:06.741 --> 30:08.879
And I've seen it recently.

30:10.836 --> 30:13.338
I remembered reading this fan letter.

30:13.338 --> 30:14.754
It's a well thought out,

30:14.754 --> 30:19.497
and respectful letter requesting Ashley's
presence at the fraternity's rotherhood night.

30:19.497 --> 30:21.510
Did she go? / No,

30:21.510 --> 30:25.056
she made a note
to herself she'd sign the DVD.

30:25.056 --> 30:27.890
Check out who the
chapter vice president is.

30:27.890 --> 30:29.549
Kyle Preston.

30:29.549 --> 30:32.217
The same guy
who found Ashley's body.

30:34.150 --> 30:37.300
This is a place of business, Kyle.

30:37.300 --> 30:41.496
So? / Take off the hat.

30:41.496 --> 30:44.567
Eric will hang it for you.

30:47.867 --> 30:49.693
Go pick it up on you're way out.

30:49.693 --> 30:50.918
What do you doing with my hat?

30:50.918 --> 30:54.538
Why didn't you tell me
you recognized Ashley, Kyle?

30:54.538 --> 30:57.054
- The dead girl?
- Mhm, the dead girl.

30:57.054 --> 30:59.861
The one you wrote the letter to.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.660
Look. You write
a letter to every pornstar

31:02.660 --> 31:04.487
hoping that just one
say's she'll show up.

31:04.487 --> 31:07.172
I mean, you've gotta get in it to win it.

31:07.172 --> 31:08.972
Clever.

31:08.972 --> 31:10.579
Let me see your leg.

31:10.579 --> 31:13.817
- What for?
- Let me see it.

31:20.569 --> 31:24.248
Okay. Before you lie
to me about that, Kyle

31:24.248 --> 31:31.836
you should know that I have Ashley's
dog who has human flesh in his teeth.

31:31.836 --> 31:35.826
Now, do I need to give you a DNA test?

31:36.888 --> 31:39.256
Okay, look, I saw her that afternoon.

31:39.256 --> 31:43.467
My girl friend was in class, and I...
I thought I just go talk to her.

31:46.225 --> 31:47.552
Miss Anders?

31:47.552 --> 31:48.964
Yes?

31:48.964 --> 31:50.435
You don't know me but uh...

31:50.435 --> 31:52.232
I'm huge fan.

31:52.232 --> 31:53.577
Rufus, down.

31:53.577 --> 31:54.831
Sorry.

31:54.831 --> 31:56.088
No, that's okay.

31:56.088 --> 31:57.897
But I was wondering...

31:57.897 --> 32:00.315
You want an autograph?

32:02.330 --> 32:03.651
The dog bit me.

32:03.651 --> 32:06.699
Why didn't you tell me this before?

32:08.216 --> 32:12.141
Because my girl friend
hates that I watch porn.

32:12.540 --> 32:15.610
And to tell you the truth,
I'm not proud of it either.

32:15.610 --> 32:19.383
Did Kyle have something
to do with that girl's death?

32:19.383 --> 32:24.364
Is there anything you wanna tell me
that may help us answer that question?

32:24.364 --> 32:29.423
The second I heard she was
a porn star, alarms went off.

32:29.423 --> 32:31.993
For Kyle,

32:31.993 --> 32:34.366
watching it kinda got out of control.

32:34.366 --> 32:36.030
Did you ever watch it together?

32:36.030 --> 32:37.711
Dorm parties.

32:37.711 --> 32:40.301
But he wanted me to watch them on...

32:40.301 --> 32:42.154
with him...

32:42.154 --> 32:43.959
we...

32:45.001 --> 32:47.602
- you know.
- And you said no.

32:49.077 --> 32:52.514
I've been upset.

32:52.514 --> 32:55.388
We never...

32:56.989 --> 32:59.145
This is embarassing.

33:03.934 --> 33:05.002
He... uh...

33:05.002 --> 33:06.917
couldn't

33:06.917 --> 33:10.604
anymore with me.

33:12.095 --> 33:14.465
That's called porn creep.

33:14.465 --> 33:19.729
It get's to be so like
I can't be with a real woman anymore.

33:20.963 --> 33:24.469
I thought he got past it,

33:24.469 --> 33:26.569
grow out of it.

33:26.569 --> 33:28.537
So did you

33:28.537 --> 33:31.389
maybe take matters
into your own hands?

33:31.389 --> 33:33.988
Killed her?

33:33.988 --> 33:35.800
No.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.757
Why would you even think that?

33:37.757 --> 33:42.413
Well, because Ashley
wasn't sexually assaulted.

33:43.860 --> 33:48.496
The muder was personal,
but not sexual.

33:48.496 --> 33:49.735
This is great.

33:49.735 --> 33:53.274
He's into porn,
but I'm the suspect.

34:22.293 --> 34:23.592
So?

34:23.592 --> 34:26.268
The nectar's consistent with
the samples from the crime scene.

34:26.268 --> 34:27.351
Good.

34:27.351 --> 34:28.920
Run with it, Eric.

34:28.920 --> 34:29.985
You're not going?

34:29.985 --> 34:33.525
No, I have some unfinished
business but you go for it.

34:33.525 --> 34:35.387
All right.

34:35.387 --> 34:37.772
Thanks for having my back, H.

34:37.772 --> 34:39.797
Always.

34:42.031 --> 34:43.862
Got a time problem, Kyle.

34:43.862 --> 34:46.775
Why, I got nowhere to be.

34:47.010 --> 34:51.380
But you said you spoke to Ashley
in the afternoon, correct?

34:51.380 --> 34:52.507
Yup.

34:52.507 --> 34:54.652
And then you found
her body at 6:00 AM?

34:54.652 --> 34:57.669
After sunrise?
You see the thing is...

34:57.669 --> 35:01.185
the nectar we found
on your hat is from a moonflower,

35:01.185 --> 35:03.465
which blooms only at night.

35:03.465 --> 35:08.138
Photosynthetic reaction makes
it open when the sun is down.

35:11.481 --> 35:13.984
Must've got it on me when I found her.

35:13.984 --> 35:17.718
You said you never touched her
and your girlfriend corroborated that.

35:17.718 --> 35:21.040
That's one true thing you told us.

35:25.983 --> 35:28.368
Thanks.

35:28.988 --> 35:31.408
What happened to your finger?

35:31.408 --> 35:33.936
Jammed it playing bascketball.

35:33.936 --> 35:35.713
It... it doesn't bend.

35:35.713 --> 35:38.652
I went from starter to bench.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.333
Prison.

35:41.528 --> 35:43.291
You killed Ashley.

35:43.291 --> 35:45.951
You strangled her.

35:51.456 --> 35:53.541
Ashley, in her movies

35:53.541 --> 35:55.956
she was always ready to go.

35:55.956 --> 35:59.977
Eyes were on the back of her head.

35:59.977 --> 36:02.515
But Gina...

36:02.515 --> 36:06.161
she would look at me.

36:06.793 --> 36:08.950
It was nothing like pornos.

36:08.950 --> 36:12.350
You didn't know how to react.

36:13.380 --> 36:17.345
I was losing my girl friend.

36:17.572 --> 36:19.143
Ashley.

36:19.143 --> 36:21.909
- Uh... yeah.
- Ashley Anders, right?

36:21.909 --> 36:23.144
Yeah?

36:23.144 --> 36:25.717
I was a big fan.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.318
Thanks, I'm...

36:27.318 --> 36:29.005
I am just... / Don't talk.

36:29.005 --> 36:30.748
But I'm... / Don't freakin talk!

36:49.933 --> 36:54.607
So what, you figured if you kill Ashley,
you'd kill your problem?

36:54.607 --> 36:58.179
I love Gina.

36:58.784 --> 37:00.620
I just needed to be rewired.

37:00.620 --> 37:03.520
That's why you brought her out there.

37:03.520 --> 37:06.653
For a little victory sex?

37:20.251 --> 37:23.134
It didn't matter.

37:23.593 --> 37:27.568
Real girls don't turn me on anymore.

37:28.219 --> 37:31.974
Fortunately, for you, where you're
going that won't be a problem.

37:35.127 --> 37:38.688
Ashley's birth certificate's
been tampered with.

37:38.688 --> 37:42.194
Paper's been chemically treated
probably with bleach.

37:42.194 --> 37:45.981
So somebody erased
the date and then changed it.

37:48.046 --> 37:49.889
The thing about bleach is

37:49.889 --> 37:54.759
it can take some things away,
but leaves others behind.

38:00.184 --> 38:02.456
I didn't know she was under age,
when she made those movies.

38:02.456 --> 38:04.156
No but when you sold the movies,

38:04.156 --> 38:05.793
you did,

38:05.793 --> 38:07.955
and that's what the conversations
on the tape was about,

38:07.955 --> 38:11.443
your plans to sell Ashley's films.

38:11.443 --> 38:15.639
I checked with the Florida UCC filings
and found out that Palm Grove Industries,

38:15.639 --> 38:17.800
has sold Fallen Films
to a Korean company.

38:17.800 --> 38:19.118
Just this week.

38:19.118 --> 38:21.790
And that's why you
doctored her birth certificate.

38:21.790 --> 38:23.870
Right?

38:25.302 --> 38:28.065
We found your finger
prints on the paper.

38:28.065 --> 38:32.525
That's felony distribution
of child pornography.

38:33.143 --> 38:36.584
That's 15 years minimum.

38:36.722 --> 38:38.152
15...

38:38.152 --> 38:42.840
was Ashley's age
when you started exploiting her.

38:43.691 --> 38:46.725
Even if I had an idea
I'm not the bad guy here,

38:46.725 --> 38:49.479
I didn't kill anyone.

38:51.209 --> 38:52.632
No.

38:52.632 --> 38:54.452
But...

38:54.452 --> 38:57.072
you created the bad guy.

39:16.903 --> 39:19.458
Snob.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.157
Talking to me?

39:23.157 --> 39:25.341
I'm Ashley's friend.

39:25.341 --> 39:26.952
You don't remember me?

39:26.952 --> 39:28.452
Coquey Divine.

39:28.452 --> 39:30.239
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
You looked different.

39:30.239 --> 39:31.570
Make up.

39:31.570 --> 39:34.145
You saw me right after a shoot.

39:34.145 --> 39:37.042
I just wanted to thank you for

39:37.042 --> 39:39.293
how you dealt with
those guys in the park.

39:39.293 --> 39:40.903
Sticking up for me.

39:40.903 --> 39:42.721
Sure. / I mean...

39:42.721 --> 39:45.587
I know you had to and all, but

39:45.587 --> 39:49.854
- No, I didn't have to.
- Come on, it was the badge talking.

39:49.854 --> 39:54.266
You're telling me some other night with friends,
you wouldn't have said the same things?

39:54.266 --> 39:56.099
No.

39:56.099 --> 39:59.941
May be not, but
you would have thought it.

40:00.070 --> 40:02.762
I don't mean to insult you...

40:02.762 --> 40:06.742
but I haven't seen
any of your movies.

40:06.742 --> 40:10.267
So you'd date a girl like me?

40:11.819 --> 40:16.604
Officially no, because you're
a material witness of mine.

40:16.771 --> 40:20.520
So cute, when guys
hide behind roles.

40:20.520 --> 40:23.189
But we both know that
I'm not exactly the kind of a girl

40:23.189 --> 40:26.054
to bring home to mom.

40:26.483 --> 40:28.083
Coquey you're...

40:28.083 --> 40:31.183
you're a nice girl.

40:32.330 --> 40:33.536
It's okay.

40:33.536 --> 40:35.325
Really...

40:35.325 --> 40:38.286
But if you ever wanted
to get together for

40:38.286 --> 40:41.490
like coffee.

40:41.490 --> 40:43.246
My real name is Sarah.

40:43.246 --> 40:44.808
Sarah Pfeiffer.

40:44.808 --> 40:46.568
Sarah.

41:10.617 --> 41:12.025
Congratulations.

41:12.025 --> 41:14.530
Bag the porn king,
his lawyer, and the killer.

41:14.530 --> 41:15.965
It's not bad week's work.

41:15.965 --> 41:17.668
I guess it is not
a good week for you, Rick

41:17.668 --> 41:20.001
unless you arrested a police offcer, uh?

41:20.001 --> 41:21.895
It isn't my job to be liked.

41:21.895 --> 41:23.415
Mission accomplished.

41:23.415 --> 41:27.824
Look, my personal feelings may have
clouded my judgement on the HAZ-MAT thing,

41:27.824 --> 41:29.118
I'll admit that.

41:29.118 --> 41:31.276
Fair enough.

41:31.362 --> 41:32.504
There she is.

41:32.504 --> 41:33.976
You're ready? / Yup!

41:33.976 --> 41:36.399
Champagne's on ice.

41:36.399 --> 41:38.784
Sounds great.

41:39.463 --> 41:42.227
I'll wait for you in the car.

41:43.017 --> 41:45.597
Nothing?

41:46.990 --> 41:48.997
Well, the truth is

41:48.997 --> 41:50.915
she hates champagne.

41:50.915 --> 41:52.361
And you're telling me this because...?

41:52.361 --> 41:56.217
I'm telling you this because
she deserves to be happy.

41:56.217 --> 41:58.331
So have fun tonight.

41:58.331 --> 42:00.395
Thank you.

42:01.059 --> 42:02.820
Seal 'Love's Devine'

42:02.820 --> 42:12.924
I had lost all of my belief you see

42:14.077 --> 42:21.582
And realize my mistake

42:21.747 --> 42:27.104
But time

42:27.104 --> 42:33.370
through a prayer to me

42:33.370 --> 42:41.704
And all around me became still

42:41.704 --> 42:44.868
I need love

42:44.868 --> 42:47.156
love's divine

42:47.156 --> 42:51.503
Please forgive me
now I see that I've been blind

42:51.503 --> 42:54.139
Give me love

42:54.139 --> 42:56.915
loves is what I need to help me

42:56.915 --> 43:01.021
know my name

43:04.756 --> 43:10.968
Through the rainstorm came sanctuary

43:14.539 --> 43:21.631
And I felt my spirit fly

43:21.631 --> 43:31.497
I had found all of my reality

43:34.065 --> 43:40.919
I realize what it takes

43:41.527 --> 43:43.919
'Cause I need love

43:43.919 --> 43:47.207
love's divine

43:47.207 --> 43:51.512
Please forgive me
now I see that I've been blind

43:51.512 --> 43:54.066
Give me love

43:54.066 --> 43:57.622
loves is what I need to help me

43:57.622 --> 44:01.209
know my name

44:04.108 --> 44:10.890
Love can help me know my name
