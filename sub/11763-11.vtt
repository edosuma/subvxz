WEBVTT

00:02.473 --> 00:03.734
WHOA!

00:03.734 --> 00:06.237
OH.

00:06.237 --> 00:08.579
(door closes)
I ALMOST KILLED A LIZARD.

00:08.579 --> 00:11.142
OH, GREAT STORY.
THANKS. I WORKED ON IT.

00:11.142 --> 00:14.014
YEAH, GO SIT DOWN.
WE'RE MAKING POPCORN.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.487
IT IS SO COOL
THAT YOU AND KIRSTEN ARE

00:16.487 --> 00:20.151
STAYING FOR A MOVIE. THANKS.
YOU SAID IF I DIDN'T, YOU
WOULDN'T GIVE ME MONEY FOR FOOD.

00:20.151 --> 00:22.793
JUST SAY,
"YOU'RE WELCOME," DUDE.
JULES DOESN'T, LIKE,

00:22.793 --> 00:25.526
ALWAYS FORCE EVERYONE
TO HANG OUT TOGETHER, DOES SHE?

00:25.526 --> 00:27.658
SAVE YOURSELF.

00:27.658 --> 00:30.131
I'M KIDDING.
(laughs) OH.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.133
(singsongy) EXCEPT I'M NOT.

00:32.133 --> 00:35.136
KIRSTEN AND I ARE
IN SUCH A GOOD PLACE RIGHT NOW.

00:35.136 --> 00:38.409
GRAYSON AND I ARE
REALLY CLICKING, TOO.
WE LOOK AT OTHER COUPLES,

00:38.409 --> 00:40.811
AND WE'RE JUST LIKE, "DAMN,
WE CRUSH 'EM," YOU KNOW?

00:40.811 --> 00:44.615
OH, SWEETIE, GRAYSON AND I
ARE A BETTER COUPLE THAN YOU.

00:44.615 --> 00:47.518
WELL, THIS SOUNDS LIKE A HEALTHY
ROAD TO GO DOWN WITH YOUR MOM.

00:47.518 --> 00:49.780
I'M OUT.
CHICKEN!

00:49.780 --> 00:53.124
I'M RIGHT BACK IN. BRING IT.
GRAYSON, POP QUIZ.
WHAT IS MY FAVORITE FOOD?

00:53.124 --> 00:57.128
WHAT MAKES ME REALLY SAD?
WHO'S MY CELEBRITY CRUSH?

00:57.128 --> 00:59.690
VEAL, VEAL AGAIN,
AND VINCE VAUGHN.

00:59.690 --> 01:02.333
(singsongy) NAILED IT.
KIRSTEN, SAME QUESTIONS. GO.

01:02.333 --> 01:03.734
PIZZA, BAD SPECIAL EFFECTS,

01:03.734 --> 01:07.168
AND YOUR CELEBRITY CRUSH
IS MEGAN FOX,

01:07.168 --> 01:09.570
WHICH IS AWESOME,
BECAUSE I LOOK JUST LIKE HER,

01:09.570 --> 01:13.244
WITH HER SUPERTIGHT PANTS
AND LONG, JET-BLACK HAIR.

01:13.244 --> 01:14.605
WHAT?

01:14.605 --> 01:16.577
NOTHING.
NOTHING CREEPY OR WEIRD.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.079
WELL, TWO OUT OF THREE
AIN'T BAD.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.852
I LIKE FLATBREADS, NOT PIZZA.
YES! WE WIN!
SUCK IT, CHUMPS.

01:21.852 --> 01:23.454
(both) MMM.

01:23.454 --> 01:25.286
WHATEVER. THEY'RE OLD.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.418
(lowered voice) HOW MANY
DID I REALLY GET RIGHT?

01:27.418 --> 01:30.421
NONE. BUT YOU KNEW TO LIE.
THAT'S WHY WE ROCK!
WHOO!

01:30.421 --> 01:32.423
YEAH,
WE'LL GRAB SOME BREAKFAST

01:32.423 --> 01:36.427
JUST AFTER I SINK
A FEW MORE PUTTS.
SO YOU LIKE DIET DR PEPPER, HUH?

01:36.427 --> 01:38.299
DO ILIKED.D.P.?

01:38.299 --> 01:41.302
HERE WE GO.
THERE'S TWO THINGS IN LIFE
THAT I'M SURE OF--

01:41.302 --> 01:43.304
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS TOO MUCH SUN

01:43.304 --> 01:46.307
AND A DIET DR PEPPER
IS UNBELIEVABLY SATISFYING.

01:46.307 --> 01:47.738
IS SOMEBODY FILMING THIS?

01:47.738 --> 01:49.740
I JUST GOT INTO
THAT PGA TOURNEY.

01:49.740 --> 01:51.742
THOSE THINGS AIN'T CHEAP.
IF I TAKE ON A SPONSOR,

01:51.742 --> 01:55.386
IT CAN HELP ME
WITH MY EXPENSES.
YOU GOT THEM TO SPONSOR YOU?

01:55.386 --> 01:57.488
NOT YET,
BUT I'M COURTIN' 'EM 24/7.

01:57.488 --> 02:00.421
YOU SEE THOSE GUYS OVER THERE?
ONE OF THEM JUST MIGHT BE

02:00.421 --> 02:03.724
A DIET DR PEPPER EXECUTIVE.
OR JUST A DOCTOR WITH
THE LAST NAME PEPPER.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.197
I MEAN, THE ODDS
ARE ABOUT THE SAME.

02:06.197 --> 02:08.799
HEY, BOYS!

02:08.799 --> 02:11.131
SIGN...

02:13.234 --> 02:14.605
ME...

02:17.238 --> 02:18.709
UP.

02:18.709 --> 02:20.511
WHOO!

02:20.511 --> 02:22.173
WHOO-HOO-HOO!

02:22.173 --> 02:24.175
(doves cooing)
(gasps) OH, LOOK.

02:24.175 --> 02:27.918
WE HAVE DOVES.
YOU KNOW DOVES MATE FOR LIFE?

02:27.918 --> 02:29.550
I DID NOT.

02:29.550 --> 02:32.823
EVEN THOUGH I SAID
I LOVED YOU A FEW WEEKS AGO

02:32.823 --> 02:34.825
AND YOU STILL
HAVEN'T TOLD ME YET

02:34.825 --> 02:37.458
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE A SLOW-MOVING WUSS,

02:37.458 --> 02:39.159
IT'S OKAY...

02:39.159 --> 02:44.635
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER FELT
THIS SAFE WITH ANYONE BEFORE.

02:44.635 --> 02:46.737
I FEEL LIKE
WE'RE THOSE DOVES.

02:46.737 --> 02:48.569
I LIKE THAT.

02:48.569 --> 02:52.243
I DON'T LOVE THAT YOU SHARED IT
WITH THE PEANUT GALLERY.
HE KNOWS HOW TO USE

02:52.243 --> 02:55.776
THE WORD "LOVE,"
SO THAT CAN'T BE THE PROBLEM.
HMM. NO. CAN'T.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.778
OH, EASE UP.
HE'S MAKING PROGRESS.

02:57.778 --> 03:00.781
DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHO ELSE
MATES FOR LIFE? TERMITES.

03:00.781 --> 03:03.214
OH, NO.
I'M WRITING A SCREENPLAY.

03:03.214 --> 03:04.615
IT'S A CARTOON ABOUT

03:04.615 --> 03:07.388
A PLUCKY TERMITE PRINCESS
NAMED MOLLY

03:07.388 --> 03:10.561
WHO GETS KIDNAPPED
AND SOLD INTO SEX SLAVERY.

03:10.561 --> 03:12.563
IT'S NOT A KID'S MOVIE.

03:12.563 --> 03:15.496
REALLY? BUG HOOKERS?
THAT'S THE TITLE.

03:15.496 --> 03:18.429
I'M GOING HOME.

03:18.429 --> 03:20.831
IS THIS A VENTI
OR A GRANDE?

03:20.831 --> 03:23.604
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS GET CONFUSED
WITH COFFEE SIZES,

03:23.604 --> 03:26.577
SO I CONVINCED THE BARISTA
TO LET ME CHANGE THE NAMES.

03:26.577 --> 03:29.480
I HAVE A LARGEY FOR... ELLIE.

03:29.480 --> 03:31.882
YOU RUIN EVERYTHING.
(laughs)

03:31.882 --> 03:34.885
OH, CRAP. IT'S THAT COUPLE
WHO LET US SHARE THEIR CABANA

03:34.885 --> 03:38.619
THAT WEEK IN KEY WEST.
WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES?
UH, UH,
STEVEN AND NANCY ROBEY.

03:38.619 --> 03:39.920
OKAY.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.553
SO I NAMED THE BIG ONES
LARGEYS BECAUSE--

03:42.553 --> 03:44.255
SHH.

03:44.255 --> 03:46.627
ELLIE. HI.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.759
STEVE, NANCERS, HOW ARE YA?

03:48.759 --> 03:50.501
IT'S DOUG AND TINA.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.936
DON'T YOU REMEMBER US?
I'M GONNA GO.

03:55.936 --> 03:59.340
OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE A DEAD MAN.
I CAN'T WATCH.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.942
YOU JERK.
YOU ALWAYS DO THAT TO ME!

04:01.942 --> 04:03.814
WHAT? WHAT'S HAPPENING?

04:03.814 --> 04:07.017
A NONFAT TEENY-TINY FOR LAURIE.

04:07.017 --> 04:09.980
IT BETTER HAVE A SHOT OF YUM
IN IT, BUDDY.

04:09.980 --> 04:12.022
SUCH AN ASS.
(laughs)

04:12.022 --> 04:16.757
I'M GLAD YOU GOT THIS BOAT BACK
ON LAND, WHERE SHE BELONGS.

04:16.757 --> 04:20.731
THIS OLD GIRL WAS NOT MADE
FOR THE SEA.
(chuckles)

04:20.731 --> 04:24.295
YOU'RE A GREAT PUTTER, MR. COBB.
HOW DO YOU STAY SO FOCUSED?

04:24.295 --> 04:27.368
I JUST KEEP MY BRAIN TOTALLY...
PFFT! EMPTY.

04:27.368 --> 04:30.301
I CAN'T EVER CLEAR MY BRAIN.
LIKE RIGHT NOW I'M THINKING,

04:30.301 --> 04:32.303
I'M BROKE.
WHY'D I BUY THIS SWEATER?

04:32.303 --> 04:35.546
STUPID CREDIT CRUNCH.
CREDIT CRUNCH.
THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

04:35.546 --> 04:37.548
YOU KNOW WHAT SOUNDS
EVEN BETTER?

04:37.548 --> 04:38.949
PEANUT BUTTER CREDIT CRUNCH.

04:38.949 --> 04:43.283
(all laugh)
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.817
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S
A BIG ECONOMIC CRISIS RIGHT NOW?
IF SOMETHING'S IMPORTANT,

04:46.817 --> 04:49.820
I USUALLY HEAR ABOUT IT
FROM BIG JAKE.
BIG JAKE OWNS THE TACO STAND
ACROSS THE STREET.

04:49.820 --> 04:52.993
HE KEEPS A PENCIL IN HIS
NECK FAT, SO HE'S CLEARLY SMART.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.995
LOOK, DAD ISN'T COMPLETELY
OBLIVIOUS. HE'S JUST GOT

04:54.995 --> 04:57.968
A BASIC CliffsNotes VERSION
OF CURRENT EVENTS.

04:57.968 --> 05:02.433
DAD, THE WORLD TODAY--GO.
WELL, ICE IS MELTING, OIL SPILT,
BLACK PRESIDENT--LOVE IT--

05:02.433 --> 05:04.735
PEOPLE WATCHING MOVIES
ON THEIR CELL PHONES

05:04.735 --> 05:06.677
AND OOH, LADY GaGa.

05:08.509 --> 05:12.383
OH, LOOK. THE JULES DOVE
IS CHASING THE GRAYSON DOVE.

05:12.383 --> 05:14.685
HOW CAN YOU TELL
WHICH ONE'S GRAYSON?

05:14.685 --> 05:16.987
THEY BOTH HAVE
BEADY LITTLE RAT EYES.

05:16.987 --> 05:18.919
AND GOOD EVENING.
(laughs)

05:18.919 --> 05:22.052
I'M THE ONE MAKING FINGER GUNS
WITH HER TINY LITTLE CLAWS.

05:22.052 --> 05:24.054
(water running)
NO, NO, HONEY.
DON'T--DON'T DRY THAT.

05:24.054 --> 05:26.927
I WANNA GIVE A LITTLE BIT
OF WATER TO THESE ROSES.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.900
(water pours)
BIG NEWS, GUYS. YOU KNOW
THAT LITTLE PATCH OF HAIR

05:29.900 --> 05:32.062
HE HAS ON HIS LOWER BACK?
UGH.

05:32.062 --> 05:33.664
(Laurie) VOMIT.
IT'S MY TRADEMARK BACK BEARD.

05:33.664 --> 05:36.336
I GOT RID OF THAT
WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING.
(Laurie) OOH!

05:36.336 --> 05:39.009
DON'T GIVE ME THAT ANGRY FACE.
THAT'S THE BURDEN

05:39.009 --> 05:41.712
OF BEING DOVES, BUDDY--
NOTHING CAN UNRAVEL US.
(wings flap, loud clang)

05:41.712 --> 05:43.944
(all scream)
AAH! WAS THAT A DOVE?!

05:43.944 --> 05:46.677
HOW BAD WAS IT?
IS IT ME OR YOU?

05:46.677 --> 05:50.751
HONESTLY,
IT'S KINDA HARD TO TELL.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.754
в™Єв™Єв™Є

06:01.932 --> 06:04.134
UGH. JULES DOVE
IS GIVING ME THE EVIL EYE.

06:04.134 --> 06:08.098
I CAN'T BLAME HER.
I TOOK HER MAN AWAY.

06:08.098 --> 06:09.940
IT'S ALL GONE.

06:09.940 --> 06:12.743
ALL THE THINGS THAT SHE THOUGHT
THEY'D DO TOGETHER,

06:12.743 --> 06:15.406
THE--THE PLACES THEY'D FLY.
HERE IT IS.

06:15.406 --> 06:17.978
DOVES' BRAINS ARE
THE SIZE OF A TIC TAC.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.950
(Tom) HEY, GUYS. WHAT'S UP?
(dog barking in distance)

06:19.950 --> 06:23.684
DID SOMEONE HAVE
A PILLOW FIGHT OUT HERE?
(Ellie) GREAT JOB, TOM.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.856
YOU'RE SO DESPERATE
TO BE PART OF THIS GANG.

06:25.856 --> 06:29.089
DO YOU THINK HURTING JULES
IS A GOOD MOVE?
H-HOW DID I--

06:29.089 --> 06:31.962
DO YOU?
SORRY, EVERYONE.

06:31.962 --> 06:33.964
WHOA. THERE'S A DEAD BIRD.

06:33.964 --> 06:36.567
OH, AND A REAL SAD ONE
RIGHT NEXT TO IT.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.699
SERIOUSLY?!
TOM.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.831
(Andy) KEEP WALKING, TOM.
I JUST FEEL AWFUL.

06:40.831 --> 06:42.473
I KNOW IT SUCKS,

06:42.473 --> 06:45.405
BUT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS...

06:45.405 --> 06:47.077
WHEN DOVES CRY.

06:47.077 --> 06:48.739
(chuckles)

06:48.739 --> 06:50.741
OH! THERE'S A LITTLE SMILE.

06:50.741 --> 06:54.144
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO PULL IT
ALL THE WAY OUT. ARE YOU READY?

06:54.144 --> 06:57.548
(singsongy) HERE IT COMES.
OHH! IT'S A FIGHTER.

06:57.548 --> 06:59.750
(normal voice) ANDY, HELP.
GRAB ME AROUND THE WAIST.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.752
ELLIE, I NEED AN EYE ROLL.

07:01.752 --> 07:02.753
DONE.

07:02.753 --> 07:04.455
AND HEAVE!
(grunts)

07:04.455 --> 07:06.196
AAH! THERE IT IS!

07:06.196 --> 07:07.798
THANKS, GUYS.

07:07.798 --> 07:09.800
PLUS, WE CAN MAKE
LITTLE ARM BANDS,

07:09.800 --> 07:13.063
YOU KNOW, OUT OF FEATHERS.
"NEVER FORGET." (chuckles)

07:13.063 --> 07:15.506
(goofy voice) NEVER FORGET.

07:17.007 --> 07:18.609
(scoffs)

07:18.609 --> 07:21.872
WHAT? WE WERE
ALL MAKING JOKES AND THEN...

07:21.872 --> 07:24.575
TOM, GO!

07:24.575 --> 07:26.947
(sighs)

07:26.947 --> 07:29.520
TRAV, AT COLLEGE,
WE GET TO LEARN

07:29.520 --> 07:31.722
SOMETHING NEW ABOUT THE WORLD
EVERY DAY.
(dish clatters)

07:31.722 --> 07:33.824
DON'T YOU WANT THAT
FOR YOUR DAD?

07:33.824 --> 07:35.986
THIS IS GONNA MAKE YOU ANGRY,

07:35.986 --> 07:39.560
BUT HE'S BASICALLY
A TALKING DOG.
OH, NO, THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ME ANGRY. WE ALL SAY THAT.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.962
WE SHOULD TURN HIM ON
TO THE MAGAZINE "THE WEEK."

07:41.962 --> 07:44.565
IT BASICALLY SUMS UP
ALL OF THE WORLD'S NEWS

07:44.565 --> 07:47.467
WITHOUT BEING COMPLICATED--
NO. MY DAD ISN'T JUST MY DAD,
OKAY?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.469
HE'S PART
OF THE CUL-DE-SAC CREW.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.901
YOU MEDDLE WITH ONE OF THEM,
THE ENTIRE GROUP RESPONDS.

07:50.901 --> 07:53.243
THEY'RE
A COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS,

07:53.243 --> 07:56.507
LIKE "CHILDREN OF THE CORN."
(nasal voice) "MALACHAI."
OH, MY GOD.
I LET A NERD SEE ME NAKED.

07:56.507 --> 07:58.509
(normal voice) LOOK,
WE SPENT OUR FRIDAY NIGHT

07:58.509 --> 08:00.581
WATCHING A MOVIE WITH MY MOM
AND HER BOYFRIEND. YOU ARE

08:00.581 --> 08:03.253
MY ESCAPE ROUTE OUT OF THE...
(strained voice) FRIEND PRISON.

08:03.253 --> 08:05.986
(normal voice) BUT IF YOU
GET INVOLVED IN THEIR LIVES,

08:05.986 --> 08:07.988
THEN THEY'RE JUST
GONNA COME FOR YOU.

08:07.988 --> 08:12.092
JUST PROMISE ME YOU WON'T
MESS WITH MY DAD, OKAY?
WHAT IF I ALREADY DID?

08:12.092 --> 08:15.896
HOW CAN I EAT THIS WITH ALL
THOSE STARVING KIDS IN AFRICA?

08:15.896 --> 08:17.598
WHAT'S WITH TALKING DOG?

08:17.598 --> 08:20.971
HE USUALLY DOESN'T LOOK UP FROM
HIS FOOD BOWL UNTIL IT'S EMPTY.

08:20.971 --> 08:23.273
HI. IT'S COFFEE GUY.

08:23.273 --> 08:26.276
HE'S KINDA STALKING ME. I DID
HAVE TO MAKE OUT WITH HIM

08:26.276 --> 08:29.610
TO GET HIM TO CHANGE
THE COFFEE SIZES.
YOU MADE OUT WITH MICKEY?

08:29.610 --> 08:31.612
I THOUGHT HE WAS GAY.
NOPE.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.984
I CAN SEE WHY A GAY GUY
WOULD GO FOR LAURIE,

08:33.984 --> 08:36.246
I MEAN, WHAT WITH
HER MAN MITTS AND ALL.

08:36.246 --> 08:37.888
HEY, MICKEY.

08:37.888 --> 08:41.121
MY NAME ISN'T MICKEY.
IT'S TIM.

08:41.121 --> 08:44.695
(chuckles)

08:44.695 --> 08:46.897
YOU DID OUR JOKE
WITH GRAPE APE?

08:46.897 --> 08:51.001
(high-pitched voice)
YEP. NAILED HER. NO LOOK.

08:51.001 --> 08:52.663
STILL NOT LOOKING.

08:52.663 --> 08:55.005
YOU'RE A HORRIBLE LITTLE MAN.

08:55.005 --> 08:57.738
(normal voice)
SEEMS A TAD STRONG.

09:02.042 --> 09:05.245
(coos)
OH! STOP! I'M SO SORRY!

09:05.245 --> 09:08.178
LUNCH IS GOING TO BE FUN.
GET IN THE CAR.

09:10.581 --> 09:13.584
ARE YOU STILL MAD?
I MEAN, IT WAS JUST A BIRD.

09:13.584 --> 09:15.626
YOU KNOW,
DEATH'S A BIG DEAL TO ME.

09:15.626 --> 09:18.258
IF IT WAS A PERSON,
WOULD YOU STILL MAKE JOKES?

09:18.258 --> 09:20.130
PROBABLY. BECAUSE IT MEANT

09:20.130 --> 09:23.834
THEY DIED SPRINTING
INTO A FRYING PAN.
(laughs) I BET
THAT'S HOW BOBBY GOES.

09:23.834 --> 09:24.935
(chuckles)

09:24.935 --> 09:28.238
OH. NO. I'M NOT THAT PERSON.

09:28.238 --> 09:31.171
WHY DOES DEATH ALWAYS HAVE
TO BE SOME BIG SOAP OPERA?

09:31.171 --> 09:34.004
I MEAN, WITH ALL THE DRAMA
AND ALL THE CRYING--

09:34.004 --> 09:36.306
I MEAN, WHO'S IT REALLY FOR?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

09:36.306 --> 09:40.280
WHEN I DIE, I WANT MY FRIENDS TO
CRY SO HARD THEY CAN'T BREATHE.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.283
(shaky voice) "WHY'D...
SHE... L-LEAVE... US?"

09:43.283 --> 09:45.355
(normal voice)
AND THEN THEY CAN'T MOVE ON

09:45.355 --> 09:48.088
AND THEIR LIVES
ARE RUINED FOREVER.
JULES, WATCH THE ROAD.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.722
NO, WE HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT THIS.
JULES!

09:51.722 --> 09:54.324
(tires screech)
I THINK WE MISSED HIM.

09:54.324 --> 09:57.027
YEAH.
HE'S PROBABLY JUST NAPPING.

09:58.829 --> 10:01.231
(Bobby, thinking) MAN,
THE MIDDLE EAST IS MESSED UP,

10:01.231 --> 10:03.834
AND IDENTITY THEFT IS RUNNING
RAMPANT IN OUR COUNTRY.

10:03.834 --> 10:08.338
WILL THE INTERNET EVER BE SAFE
AGAIN? SOME EXPERTS SAY NO!

10:08.338 --> 10:10.310
(sighs)

10:10.310 --> 10:13.383
DAMN IT!
WHAT THE HELL? THAT'S
THE TENTH ONE YOU MISSED.

10:13.383 --> 10:16.046
IT'S JUST THE WORLD.
I FEEL TOO HARD, ANDY.

10:16.046 --> 10:17.888
I CAN SHAKE IT.

10:17.888 --> 10:19.119
DARFUR.

10:19.119 --> 10:22.092
DAMN IT!

10:22.092 --> 10:24.094
I'VE GIVEN HIM
SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN,

10:24.094 --> 10:26.096
BUT HE'S IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE.
(dog barking)

10:26.096 --> 10:28.198
CAN YOU FIX HIM?

10:28.198 --> 10:30.200
LOOK, LADY, IT'S A SQUIRREL.

10:30.200 --> 10:33.103
I MEAN, IT'S GREAT THE TWO
OF YOU CARE ABOUT HIM SO MUCH.
(mouthing words)

10:33.103 --> 10:36.266
OH, GOT IT.
GOT WHAT? WHAT?
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

10:36.266 --> 10:38.869
HMM? I DIDN'T...
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

10:38.869 --> 10:41.171
THIS IS NOT
SOME ORDINARY SQUIRREL.

10:41.171 --> 10:44.274
THIS IS MY PET, TUFFIE.

10:44.274 --> 10:45.876
TUFFIE L'RUE.

10:45.876 --> 10:48.418
THEN PET HIM.
OKAY. (chuckles)

10:48.418 --> 10:50.420
TUFFS?

10:50.420 --> 10:52.652
MAMA'S HERE.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.384
I'M GONNA PET YOU NOW.

10:54.384 --> 10:58.658
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES HE LIKES IT
WHEN I DON'T TOUCH HIM.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.161
YEAH, I SHOULD
JUST PUT HIM DOWN.
NO!

11:01.161 --> 11:04.264
OKAY, QUICK QUESTION--
CAN DOVES HOLD GRUDGES?

11:04.264 --> 11:07.137
NO. THEY'VE GOT
TIC TAC BRAINS.

11:07.137 --> 11:09.740
(scoffs) OKAY, WELL, THIS GUY
IS OBVIOUSLY A QUACK,

11:09.740 --> 11:12.743
SO WHY DON'T WE TRY TO FIND
SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T GO TO...

11:12.743 --> 11:16.046
STANFORD.
WE HAVE DONE ALL WE CAN
FOR THE LITTLE GUY,

11:16.046 --> 11:19.309
YOU KNOW, INCLUDING WRAPPING HIM
IN MY BRAND-NEW CASHMERE HOODIE

11:19.309 --> 11:22.152
THAT IS SO SOFT,
IT MAKES MY NIPPLES SLEEPY.

11:22.152 --> 11:24.284
WE'RE SAVING HIM.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.787
I'M SORRY. IT DOESN'T PASS
THE "RIDICULOUS" TEST.

11:26.787 --> 11:27.988
(scoffs)

11:27.988 --> 11:30.861
JULES, DON'T... (chuckles)

11:30.861 --> 11:32.823
(doorbell rings rapidly)

11:36.096 --> 11:39.099
YEAH, IF ALL THE ICE MELTS,
THEN THE POLAR BEARS

11:39.099 --> 11:43.033
WILL SINK LIKE BIG WHITE ROCKS,
AND THEN THEY'LL BE GONE.
DID YOU DO THIS TO HIM?

11:43.033 --> 11:44.404
UM...

11:44.404 --> 11:46.436
TRAV, COME OUT HERE!

11:46.436 --> 11:47.778
WHOA!

11:47.778 --> 11:49.179
GOOD. EVERYBODY'S HERE.

11:49.179 --> 11:51.181
YOU BROKE BOBBY.
YOU FIX HIM.

11:51.181 --> 11:54.144
AND I'M BORROWING THIS.
IT'S CUTE.
(clears throat)

11:54.144 --> 11:57.347
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
OH. I USED TO ONLY GIVE ANDY
SCALP MASSAGES,

11:57.347 --> 12:01.151
BUT NOW I GIVE THEM TO EVERYONE.
THAT'S OKAY, RIGHT, BOO?

12:01.151 --> 12:04.254
KIRSTEN, PLEASE ENJOY ELLIE'S
FAVORITE SHOULDER MASSAGE.

12:04.254 --> 12:07.727
I'LL WORK AROUND THE BRA STRAPS.
JUST RELAX.

12:07.727 --> 12:12.102
YEAH, THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
CAN YOU TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES?

12:12.102 --> 12:14.264
NO. TOO SAD.

12:14.264 --> 12:16.466
TOO SAD.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

12:16.466 --> 12:19.739
YOU MEDDLED,
AND NOW THEY'VE COME FOR YOU.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.212
DRINK LOTS OF WATER
WHEN I'M DONE.

12:22.212 --> 12:24.474
I HOPE YOU CALLED ME OVER
TO APOLOGIZE

12:24.474 --> 12:27.818
FOR MAKING ME TAKE THE BUS HOME
FROM THE VET.

12:27.818 --> 12:30.821
SOME CRAZY TRIED TO GET ME TO
SMELL HIS FINGER FOR 20 MINUTES.

12:30.821 --> 12:35.485
LUCKILY, I FOUND A VET
THAT WASN'T A SQUIRREL RACIST.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.330
SEE, GRAYSON?

12:40.330 --> 12:42.532
EVERY LIFE IS
WORTH FIGHTING FOR.

12:42.532 --> 12:45.495
THAT'S NOT THE SAME SQUIRREL.
YES, IT IS.

12:45.495 --> 12:48.498
NO.SEE, OUR SQUIRREL SAT
IN MY LAP FOR A LONG RIDE.

12:48.498 --> 12:52.172
IT HAD A TINIER NOSE AND HIS,
UH, BOTTOM HALF WAS SQUISHED.

12:52.172 --> 12:55.005
OH,
ARE YOU CALLING ME A LIAR?

12:55.005 --> 12:58.008
DID SOMEONE PUT A DEAD SQUIRREL
IN MY TRASH?

12:58.008 --> 13:00.380
AND--AND WHY'S IT
IN A... TAMPON BOX?

13:00.380 --> 13:05.085
BECAUSE HE DESERVES
A PRETTY, COLORFUL COFFIN, TOM!

13:05.085 --> 13:08.388
ALL THIS JUST TO MAKE ME
FEEL LIKE CRAP.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.220
GREAT STUFF, JULES.

13:21.231 --> 13:22.532
GRAYSON?

13:22.532 --> 13:25.135
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.

13:25.135 --> 13:28.138
COME OVER.
IT'S SO FAR.
WHAT IF I PROMISE

13:28.138 --> 13:31.141
TO STOP TALKING BY THE TIME
YOU COME OVER HERE?

13:31.141 --> 13:33.343
DEAL!
I'M SORRY I TRICKED YOU.

13:33.343 --> 13:35.946
IT'S JUST THAT BETWEEN
THE DOVE AND THE SQUIRREL,

13:35.946 --> 13:38.518
I-I STARTED FEELING LIKE
THE ANGEL OF DEATH.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.191
AND THEN I LOST IT AND--AND I
WANTED YOU TO FEEL GUILTY

13:41.191 --> 13:43.423
SO YOU'D FEEL AS BAD
AS I FEEL. DONE.

13:43.423 --> 13:46.356
I ACCEPT.
YOU GET WHY MURDERING
TWO ANIMALS

13:46.356 --> 13:48.598
WOULD MAKE ME SPIRAL, RIGHT?
I DON'T.

13:48.598 --> 13:52.502
DEEP DOWN, YOU'RE PROBABLY
FEELING JUST AS SAD AS I AM.
I'M NOT.

13:52.502 --> 13:55.936
YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE SOMEDAY.
I WON'T.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.608
GREAT. SAME PAGE. (gasps)

13:58.608 --> 14:01.371
DID I JUST STEP ON A LIZARD?
YEP.

14:01.371 --> 14:02.973
IS HE OKAY?

14:02.973 --> 14:05.845
BECAUSE MY FOOT FEELS LIKE
IT'S FLAT ON THE GROUND.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.848
WELL, ALL I CAN SEE IS HIS TAIL,
BUT IT'S STILL MOVING.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.250
OH, NO, WAIT.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.381
IT STOPPED.

14:11.381 --> 14:13.483
(whispers)
OH, ANGEL OF DEATH.

14:13.483 --> 14:14.885
(chuckles)

14:18.989 --> 14:20.860
MAYBE THIS'LL HELP.

14:20.860 --> 14:24.134
GUYS... THE WORLD IS BAD.

14:24.134 --> 14:27.097
(sighs) DEEP STUFF, DAD.

14:27.097 --> 14:30.870
HEY, WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT YOU
LIKE YOU'RE NOT HERE, OKAY?

14:30.870 --> 14:33.273
USED TO IT.
WE GOTTA RESET HIS BRAIN.

14:33.273 --> 14:37.147
WELL, WE'RE GOOD PEOPLE,
BUT WE DON'T GET THAT DEPRESSED.
MM-HMM.

14:37.147 --> 14:40.150
WE'RE SO USED TO
THE CONSTANT FLOOD OF BAD NEWS

14:40.150 --> 14:43.313
THAT WE ARE DESENSITIZED.
THAT'S IT. TURN ON THE NEWS
CHANNEL. WE GOTTA GIVE HIM MORE.

14:43.313 --> 14:46.116
OKAY.
MORE BAD NEWS?
I CAN'T TAKE IT.

14:46.116 --> 14:49.289
(remote control thuds)
MY HEART ALREADY FEELS LIKE IT'S
GOT A FAT CHICK SITTING ON IT.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.521
I KNOW IT'S CYNICAL,
BUT THE MORE YOU'RE EXPOSED

14:51.521 --> 14:53.663
TO THE HORRORS OF THE WORLD,
THE LESS IT'LL HURT.

14:53.663 --> 14:55.665
EVENTUALLY,
IT'LL ALL BE WHITE NOISE.

14:55.665 --> 14:58.668
OH, GREAT. THEN I'LL HAVE SOME
LOUD NOISE GHOST IN MY HEAD

14:58.668 --> 15:02.332
KEEPING ME
FROM MAKING PUTTS.
NO, DAD, IT CAN BE ANY NOISE.

15:02.332 --> 15:05.335
(can fizzes, soda pop pouring)
I MEAN, THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME NOISE OUT THERE

15:05.335 --> 15:07.677
THAT TOTALLY SOOTHES
AND RELAXES YOU.

15:07.677 --> 15:10.380
(fizzing)

15:10.380 --> 15:12.112
MMM.

15:13.944 --> 15:16.086
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

15:16.086 --> 15:18.388
(alarm rings)

15:18.388 --> 15:20.150
WHAT?

15:20.150 --> 15:23.193
(ringing stops)
I SET THAT. 3:00 SUNDAY...

15:23.193 --> 15:25.195
(high-pitched, singsong vice)
QUICKIE TIME!

15:25.195 --> 15:27.127
SOSEXY.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.429
YEAH.
PLUS, WE'RE FIGHTING.

15:29.429 --> 15:33.363
YOU THINK I'M GONNA LET YOU
GET ALL UP IN THIS?
BUT YOU'RE WEARING
YOUR SEXY QUICKIE OUTFIT.

15:33.363 --> 15:35.005
ANDY, I'M WEARING...

15:35.005 --> 15:36.536
OH, I AM.

15:36.536 --> 15:40.040
DOESN'T MATTER.
THE STORE IS CLOSED.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.072
IS THIS REALLY
ABOUT THE NAME THING?

15:42.072 --> 15:45.045
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MAKING
SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.377
WHEN JULES WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE STUPID DOVES,

15:47.377 --> 15:50.250
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT?
WE'RE THE DOVES.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.253
AND EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE
TO SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME

15:53.253 --> 15:55.255
TRAPPED
IN JULES' FRIEND PRISON

15:55.255 --> 15:58.028
WITH PEOPLE WHO SHARE
EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERYTHING,

15:58.028 --> 16:01.261
WE STILL FIND A WAY
TO PROTECT WHAT'S OURS.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.994
THAT JOKE THING WAS
OURTHING,

16:03.994 --> 16:05.996
AND YOU JUST GAVE IT AWAY.

16:08.438 --> 16:11.071
SO DEFINITE "NO"
ON THE QUICKIE?

16:14.104 --> 16:16.446
I GOT YOUR SLIPPERS.

16:16.446 --> 16:17.647
MM.

16:17.647 --> 16:18.978
(thud)

16:18.978 --> 16:21.451
YOU KNOW, I WAS WRONG
TO COMPARE US TO DOVES.

16:21.451 --> 16:25.255
I MEAN, WE'RE PEOPLE. IF SOMEONE
PUT A FRYING PAN OUT THE WINDOW,

16:25.255 --> 16:27.257
I WOULDN'T RUN INTO IT.
(thud)

16:27.257 --> 16:29.419
GOD.

16:29.419 --> 16:31.021
I DIDN'T LAUGH.

16:31.021 --> 16:33.023
THANK YOU.
HAPPY TO DO IT.

16:33.023 --> 16:35.195
YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU'RE
A LITTLE EMOTIONAL RIGHT NOW.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.727
(refrigerator door closes)
SO I THINK THE SMART THING
FOR US TO DO

16:37.727 --> 16:40.500
WOULD BE TO JUST CHILL, NOT GET
INTO ANY DEEP CONVERSATIONS.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.134
DO YOU EVEN THINK
WE'RE RIGHT FOR EACH OTHER?
THANKS FOR LISTENING.

16:44.134 --> 16:46.136
WHEN A DOVE JUST SEES
ANOTHER DOVE

16:46.136 --> 16:48.138
THAT THEY WANNA
KNOCK FEATHERS WITH,

16:48.138 --> 16:50.140
BOOM,
THEY'RE TOGETHER FOR LIFE.

16:50.140 --> 16:52.142
BUT WITH PEOPLE,
WHETHER OR NOT THEY LAST

16:52.142 --> 16:54.444
IS ALL ABOUT COMPATIBILITY.

16:54.444 --> 16:56.586
ALL THAT TALK ABOUT DEATH
JUST SHOWED ME

16:56.586 --> 16:58.718
THAT WE'RE JUST SO DIFFERENT.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.751
I MEAN, I'M THIS EMOTIONAL MESS
WHO WANTS TO TALK

17:01.751 --> 17:03.353
ABOUT EVERY SINGLE FEELING,

17:03.353 --> 17:06.256
AND YOU'RE THIS CLOSED-OFF,
GUARDED ROBOT.

17:06.256 --> 17:08.528
(imitates robot beeping)

17:08.528 --> 17:11.731
LOOK, I'M PROBABLY
JUST BEING STUPID,

17:11.731 --> 17:15.505
BUT, YOU KNOW,
TODAY MADE ME REALLY SAD.

17:15.505 --> 17:17.207
I'M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS.

17:17.207 --> 17:19.209
YOU WANT ME TO COME
WITH YOU?

17:19.209 --> 17:21.611
NO.

17:21.611 --> 17:25.645
YOU'RE ALREADY PART OF THE GANG
AND YOU'RE BLOWING IT.

17:30.250 --> 17:33.052
STILL RIGHT HERE.

17:35.185 --> 17:36.726
OHH! GOD.

17:36.726 --> 17:38.728
ALL THAT NEWS,
AND I STILL CAN'T GET

17:38.728 --> 17:41.731
THE WORLD'S MISERY
OUT OF MY HEAD.
NO, MR. COBB, LET IT ALL IN.

17:41.731 --> 17:43.733
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO BECOME DESENSITIZED,

17:43.733 --> 17:46.466
LIKE THE REST OF US.
WHITE NOISE, DAD.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.067
OKAY.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.741
(thinking) TSUNAMIS, WAR,
EARTHQUAKES, POVERTY, GENOCIDE,

17:51.741 --> 17:55.605
RACISM, HUNGER, URBAN GANGS...
(thoughts overlapping)

17:55.605 --> 17:59.078
(thoughts fade, loud fizzing)

18:01.481 --> 18:04.614
YEAH! BABY, THE WORLD SUCKS,
BUT WHO CARES?

18:04.614 --> 18:06.286
WHOO!

18:06.286 --> 18:09.119
HE'S BACK!

18:09.119 --> 18:12.322
(knock on door)
M-MRS. TORRES?

18:12.322 --> 18:15.325
WHAT?
I KNOW YOU WERE MEAN TO ME
THE OTHER MORNING,

18:15.325 --> 18:18.828
BUT, UH, WRITING ME A PERSONAL
APOLOGY NOTE--THAT'S SPECIAL.

18:18.828 --> 18:22.872
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I HATE APOLOGIES.

18:22.872 --> 18:25.875
THEY MAKE ME FEEL WORSE
THAN WHEN ANDY SETS ME UP

18:25.875 --> 18:28.478
TO CALL SOMEONE
BY THE WRO--ONG...

18:28.478 --> 18:31.181
NAME.

18:31.181 --> 18:34.244
IS THAT OUR NEW THING?
FAKE APOLOGY NOTES?

18:34.244 --> 18:37.617
YEP. AND I PROMISE
I'LL ONLY DO IT TO YOU.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.249
I HATE IT.

18:39.249 --> 18:41.221
THANK YOU.

18:42.722 --> 18:46.196
THIS IS GOOD.
THIS IS A-A GOOD THING.

18:46.196 --> 18:49.599
GO HOME, TOM.

18:49.599 --> 18:52.232
(man) в™Є THOUGHT A LOT
ABOUT YOU TODAY в™Є

18:52.232 --> 18:53.633
HMM?
OH, YEAH.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.235
WHOO!

18:55.235 --> 18:58.468
(door closes)
в™Є WHY I DID
I CAN'T EXACTLY SAY в™Є

18:58.468 --> 19:00.740
в™Є 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T... в™Є

19:00.740 --> 19:02.512
PUT BIG CARL DOWN.

19:02.512 --> 19:04.244
NO. HE UNDERSTANDS ME.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.246
COME ON.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.218
в™Єв™Єв™Є

19:08.218 --> 19:09.619
COME WITH ME.

19:09.619 --> 19:11.281
(whispers) STAY RIGHT THERE.

19:11.281 --> 19:14.284
в™Є AND MY EYES DID SHUT в™Є

19:14.284 --> 19:16.786
в™Є AND MY MIND GOT TANGLED UP в™Є

19:16.786 --> 19:19.259
WHAT IS THIS?

19:19.259 --> 19:22.292
WELL, IT'S A PET CEMETERY,
TO HONOR THE FALLEN.

19:22.292 --> 19:24.364
YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE DOVE,

19:24.364 --> 19:26.636
THAT'S THE SQUIRREL,

19:26.636 --> 19:29.269
AND IN THAT ONE,
I JUST BURIED YOUR WHOLE SHOE.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.901
THE LIZARD
WAS REALLY ON THERE.

19:31.901 --> 19:33.503
THIS IS A LITTLE CREEPY.

19:33.503 --> 19:35.905
YEAH, SERIAL KILLER ALERT.

19:35.905 --> 19:39.279
ARE WE REALLY AT A DEAD LIZARD'S
FUNERAL IN YOUR MOM'S YARD?

19:39.279 --> 19:41.281
YOU DID THIS TO US.

19:41.281 --> 19:44.284
DID YOU JUST BRING ME OUT HERE
TO MAKE FUN OF ME?

19:44.284 --> 19:47.657
NO. LOOK, I DON'T LIKE
SHARING HOW I FEEL,

19:47.657 --> 19:50.220
ESPECIALLY IN FRONT
OF THE PEANUT GALLERY,

19:50.220 --> 19:52.492
BUT I KNOW IT MATTERS TO YOU,

19:52.492 --> 19:55.795
SO I INVITED THEM SO THEY COULD
ALL HEAR ME SAY THIS...

19:55.795 --> 19:57.397
в™Єв™Єв™Є

19:57.397 --> 19:58.928
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

19:58.928 --> 20:02.402
YOU'RE WORRIED THAT WE'RE NOT
ALIKE ENOUGH TO BE TOGETHER.

20:02.402 --> 20:05.535
ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT
US IS HOW DIFFERENT WE ARE.

20:05.535 --> 20:08.438
IT'S THE COUPLES THAT ARE
DIFFERENT THAT REALLY WORK.

20:08.438 --> 20:10.540
I MEAN, LOOK AT THESE FREAKS.

20:10.540 --> 20:13.543
I MEAN, HIS FAVORITE MOVIE
IS "DIE HARD," AND...

20:13.543 --> 20:15.515
SHE'S A HORRIBLE PERSON.

20:15.515 --> 20:18.848
MY FAVORITE MOVIE IS
ACTUALLY "LOVE ACTUALLY."

20:18.848 --> 20:21.251
OOH. THERE'S THE SEQUEL.
(chuckles)

20:21.251 --> 20:23.353
I'VE BEEN SCARED TO SAY THIS,

20:23.353 --> 20:26.256
BUT ALL THOSE WAYS THAT
YOU'RE DIFFERENT FROM ME--

20:26.256 --> 20:28.528
THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU.

20:28.528 --> 20:31.401
(gasps and squeals)

20:31.401 --> 20:33.633
I LOVE YOU, JULES.

20:33.633 --> 20:38.237
в™Єв™Єв™Є

20:48.278 --> 20:50.280
MAY I HELP YOU?
OH, HEY, RACH.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.752
NOW BEAR WITH ME.
I HAVE TO ORDER FOR EVERYONE.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.884
OKAY, I'LL HAVE ONE SOY LARGEY,
ONE TEENY-TINY,

20:54.884 --> 20:57.527
ONE TEENY TEENY-TINY UNLEADED,
ONE PLAIN JANE, EXTRA YUM--

20:57.527 --> 20:59.959

20:59.959 --> 21:02.962
UH, A BABY JOEY, A MIDNIGHT WITH
A FULL MOON--HOLD THE PUMPKIN,

21:02.962 --> 21:04.564

21:04.564 --> 21:07.467
I NEED A HEAVY "D"
IN A TRAVEL MUG, PLEASE,

21:07.467 --> 21:09.539

21:09.539 --> 21:12.542

21:12.542 --> 21:15.545

21:15.545 --> 21:19.649
AND A FRAP CAP HEAVY ON THE...
(makes whooshing sounds)

21:19.649 --> 21:21.651
OH, AND LET'S SEE.
WHAT'S FRESH?

21:21.651 --> 21:24.314
OKAY, WELL, I'LL TAKE
THREE RAISIN HAPPY MUFFINS,

21:24.314 --> 21:25.715
A FRENCH MUSTACHE,

21:25.715 --> 21:27.817
AND UGH--A FART MUFFIN--

21:27.817 --> 21:30.590
OH, AND I FORGOT TO ORDER MY OWN
COFFEE. CAN I GET A TAYE DIGGS,

21:30.590 --> 21:33.563
WHICH IS BLACK AND EXTRA STRONG
AND SMOOTH BUT ALSO VERY SWEET?

21:33.563 --> 21:35.865
WOULD IT BE EASIER
IF I JUST

21:35.865 --> 21:37.867
CAME BACK THERE
AND MADE IT MYSELF?
