00:31.322 --> 00:32.157


00:32.240 --> 00:34.701
I am not looking forward to work today.

00:34.784 --> 00:37.412
Joe Jack is on some kind of crazy diet.

00:37.495 --> 00:38.371
And he keeps asking me

00:38.455 --> 00:40.832
how his jeans are fitting.

00:40.915 --> 00:43.460
-Hello, office slaves!
Hello!

00:43.543 --> 00:45.462
-
My boss is letting me telecommute.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.881
You know what that word means,
stupid hillbillies?

00:47.964 --> 00:50.425
It's English for "work from home".

00:50.508 --> 00:54.012
Look at me in bathrobe,
already dressed for work.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.346
Well, that's asinine.

00:55.430 --> 00:59.017
Work and home were intended to be
enjoyed separately.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.811
I see from your face that
you are seething with jealousy.

01:02.562 --> 01:03.480


01:03.563 --> 01:05.648
Well, so long, slaves.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.233
-

01:07.317 --> 01:08.318
So long!

01:08.401 --> 01:09.486


01:10.361 --> 01:11.905


01:12.405 --> 01:13.239


01:13.323 --> 01:14.949
-Oh, pass it to Hernandez!

01:15.033 --> 01:18.161
Oh! What are you doing?
Pass it to Hernandez!

01:18.244 --> 01:22.248
The only part of soccer I like is
when the announcer yells "goal."

01:22.332 --> 01:24.167
Well, then you're gonna love
this announcer.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.711
He used to make his living blowing up
bounce houses.

01:26.795 --> 01:30.090
I will bet you he will go fifteen seconds.

01:30.173 --> 01:34.844
Fifteen seconds? That's crazy.
I'll take that bet.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.179
What are we betting for?

01:36.262 --> 01:38.556
Hmm. Bragging rights.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.266
What are bragging rights?

01:40.350 --> 01:44.187
Bragging rights is the sanctioned ability
to gloat insufferably.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.606
Usually for a prescribed period of time.

01:49.526 --> 01:55.782
<i>Goal</i>!

01:57.492 --> 01:59.619
Seven seconds! I win!

01:59.702 --> 02:02.122
I am the champion!

02:02.205 --> 02:05.667
I do believe I will exercise
my rights now.

02:07.752 --> 02:11.089
Oh, you know, I hurt my foot brag-dancing.

02:11.172 --> 02:16.678
I think I need some Doctor Schoooooooll's!

02:16.761 --> 02:20.557
And David in the Department
is a big-time dumbo.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.766
Oh, big time.

02:21.850 --> 02:25.687
If you have nothing else to do than tell
me how co-workers should do their jobs,

02:25.770 --> 02:27.313
maybe you can help me clean.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.941
-My daddy is coming today.
-Wha...?

02:30.024 --> 02:31.484
I thought the general wasn't coming

02:31.651 --> 02:32.485
until end of the week.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.864
He took control of homeowner's association
earlier than planned.

02:35.947 --> 02:39.868
It was Daddy's first bloodless coup.
He's really mellowing out.

02:39.951 --> 02:43.413
Oh, I hope so.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.415
He treats me so bad, Minh.

02:45.498 --> 02:46.833
And in my own house.

02:46.916 --> 02:50.712
Oh, he doesn't mean anything by it.
It's just his way.

02:50.795 --> 02:54.632
Besides, he cosigned our loan,
so kind of his house too.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.468
I know.

03:09.647 --> 03:12.734
So is it true Minh's dad used to work
for a dictator?

03:12.817 --> 03:14.444
Several dictators.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.654
And then he worked for Pac Bell.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.618
There's the general's taxi!
Do I look okay?

03:21.701 --> 03:23.411
Don't loiter here! Go home!

03:23.536 --> 03:24.454
Eat some butter!

03:27.373 --> 03:28.791
Welcome, General.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.710
I forgot how handsome you are.

03:30.793 --> 03:31.878
Stand down!

03:32.045 --> 03:33.004
Descendant of fisherman!

03:35.298 --> 03:37.884
-Fisherman...
-Daddy!

03:42.180 --> 03:44.933
-This is for you.
-So sweet.

03:45.016 --> 03:48.186
I'll put right next to elephant dressed
as Ninja.

04:06.537 --> 04:09.624
-So, you're good with computer?
-Yes!

04:09.707 --> 04:13.962
Then put MP3 in my watch!
I want talk radio and Frank Sinatra!

04:16.089 --> 04:17.298
Well, that not how it work.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.300
-Do it! Drag and drop!
-But I...

04:19.384 --> 04:22.095
-Drag and drop!
-But this watch isn't even digital!

04:24.931 --> 04:27.850
You should have married Phoukon Vivarand.

04:27.934 --> 04:31.729
He was VP of Acquisitions
at Ingersoll Rand.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.691
Now he's Senior VP!

04:34.774 --> 04:37.819
Daddy, you like teasing Kahn too much.

04:37.902 --> 04:42.198
All I'm saying is you and Connie
would have been better off

04:42.282 --> 04:43.992
if you'd married Phoukon.

04:45.034 --> 04:48.538
Uh, I wouldn't exist if
she married Phoukon.

04:48.746 --> 04:51.833
Is that what your dad told you?

04:54.168 --> 04:55.378
Kahn!

05:00.967 --> 05:04.387
You have to help me.
You got any Red Rooster sauce for General?

05:04.470 --> 05:07.098
I forgot to buy some.
And now he's on a rampage!

05:07.181 --> 05:10.476
Uh, I'm not sure
what you're asking me for.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.855
Hot sauce now!

05:18.693 --> 05:21.404
I have this weird feeling.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.698
I think it's sympathy for Kahn.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.283
-I know what you mean.
-Yeah.

05:25.366 --> 05:26.993
Mm-hm.

05:27.076 --> 05:28.411
-Who wants a beer?
-Me!

05:28.494 --> 05:29.579
-Sounds good!
-Yeah, man.

05:31.456 --> 05:34.000
Okay, General. Got it. I'm not a man.

05:34.083 --> 05:39.088
But do you want spicy, extra spicy,
or one where rooster look really mad?

05:39.172 --> 05:40.006
Hello?

05:46.137 --> 05:48.306
Is the bar next door any good?

05:51.559 --> 05:54.020

06:09.285 --> 06:11.371
I'm not messing with that guy!

06:11.454 --> 06:12.288
Ted.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.706
That was so amazing!

06:15.041 --> 06:19.379
Sometimes I wish guys could have,
like a friendship marriage.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.465
I did not know you liked karaoke, Kahn.

06:22.548 --> 06:25.343
Oh, anything to get away from
my father-in-law.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.637
It's terrible at home, Ted.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.973
Anyone ever make you feel like
you're less of a man?

06:31.057 --> 06:32.100
Feel?

06:32.183 --> 06:34.519
Kahn, the wonderful thing about karaoke

06:34.602 --> 06:38.981
is it's an emotional outlet but it still
allows us to maintain proper distance.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.694
Please, save it for the stage.
It's cathartic. Trust me.

06:50.868 --> 06:53.955
Uh, number 128, I guess.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.105
No, sorry.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.357
Gotta go see father-in-law.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.612
Eh, forget him!

08:07.695 --> 08:09.363
Who wants more Kahn?

08:19.540 --> 08:21.375
Hello, happy family!

08:21.459 --> 08:24.295
Where are my condiments?

08:24.378 --> 08:27.298
Sorry, General.
It's in everybody's bloody Mary.

08:27.548 --> 08:28.382
Uh!

08:28.466 --> 08:30.968
I was a big hit at the karaoke bar
in Little Laos.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.095
The crowd loved me!

08:33.179 --> 08:37.308
They even took my picture
and put it on the Wall of Fame!

08:37.391 --> 08:40.686
-Wow, Dad. That's so cool!
-Yeah.

08:40.770 --> 08:44.148
Kind of reminds me of the rebel
with shiny shirt and pompadour

08:44.232 --> 08:46.400
I met at disco in Laos.

08:51.405 --> 08:53.533
Don't be so happy with yourself!

08:53.616 --> 08:58.037
You're just singing someone else's songs.
No skill involved.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.206
Unlike poetry.

09:00.289 --> 09:05.086
I shall now recite a poem I wrote
while awaiting trial at The Hague.

09:06.963 --> 09:13.844
"So much depends upon inhumanity
and death.

09:13.928 --> 09:18.849
We must not forget.
Yet we cannot remember.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.687
Death be not proud?

09:22.770 --> 09:24.105
Then who?"

09:25.940 --> 09:29.402
So after you finished your song,
did you smash your air guitar?

09:29.485 --> 09:30.528
I'm sorry, Connie.

09:30.611 --> 09:33.739
We must respect our elders
and listen to his poem.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.450
Please, General, continue.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.953
I tell you later how I jump
into the crowd.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.333
That's the way I'd do it.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.252
You'd save a load on a casket...

09:46.335 --> 09:49.672
-Though the cannon might be expensive.
-Hello, Hank Hill.

09:49.755 --> 09:51.757
I accidentally got some of your mail.

09:53.884 --> 09:57.597
Hey, I've been waiting for "Snap On"
to send me their catalog for years.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.140
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

09:59.223 --> 10:01.559
I've been getting your catalog for years.

10:01.642 --> 10:02.643
I usually throw it out.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.270
But today I thought, "What the heck?"

10:05.646 --> 10:07.356
What has gotten into you, Kahn?

10:07.440 --> 10:11.444
Ever since I started doing karaoke,
nothing bothers me anymore.

10:11.527 --> 10:14.405
Not the General, not you guys, nothing.

10:14.488 --> 10:16.741
Hey, you guys want to come watch me sing?

10:16.824 --> 10:18.576
I'll put you on my guest list.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.287
I'm on a list!

10:28.169 --> 10:30.755
Huh. Kahn must be really good at this.

10:30.838 --> 10:33.758
I've never seen so many people happy
to see him before.

10:33.841 --> 10:38.471
I've heard five people refer to Kahn
as "The Morning After" guy.

10:38.554 --> 10:41.015
Yeah. He is really popular here.

10:41.098 --> 10:43.267
He is popular with losers.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.561
That make him number-one loser.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.897
Steve, good Elvis.

10:47.980 --> 10:51.108
Oh, John, your Spandau Ballet make me cry.

10:51.192 --> 10:54.403
Bob, your Freddie Mercury
getting much, much better.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.490
Natasha, you got that wrong.

10:57.573 --> 11:00.201
"Every step you take,
I'll be watching you."

11:00.910 --> 11:03.329
And again, people,
if you order the buffalo wings,

11:03.412 --> 11:06.082
please wash your hands
before touching the songbook.

11:07.083 --> 11:10.252
Hey, MC guy, turn off words.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.213
I sing without net tonight.

11:14.382 --> 11:17.301
I see you're a truly beautiful crowd.

11:18.552 --> 11:24.809
<i>♪ There's got to be a morning after ♪</i>

11:37.571 --> 11:38.906
Hey, Kahn.

11:38.989 --> 11:41.117
Minh, this is my co-worker, David,

11:41.367 --> 11:42.910
that I talk about all the time.

11:42.993 --> 11:46.038
Dumbo. Nice guy though.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.416
We actually came out tonight
to make fun of you.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.751
But, man, you're awesome!

11:52.044 --> 11:53.629
Hope to see you back at work sometime.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.589
They should stop forcing you
to telecommute.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.007
I'm being forced?

11:58.843 --> 12:00.928
It's all good. It's all good.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.642
Kahn's attitude

12:06.726 --> 12:07.852
has really changed, Peggy.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.020
He's actually tolerable.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.814
Eh, it will not last.

12:11.897 --> 12:16.318
Sure Kahn is nice when he's successful.
But he's a jerk when he fails.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.321
And deep down, he thinks he's a failure.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.615
Kahn will be a jerk again within the week.

12:21.699 --> 12:24.910
Care to put a little wager on that?

12:24.994 --> 12:28.748
Now, hold on.
You can't bet on a human being like that.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.249
Even if it is Kahn.

12:30.332 --> 12:33.669
Oh, Hank, this is what mother/son bonding
looks like now.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.588
How about we up the ante?

12:35.671 --> 12:38.007
Winner gets reverse bragging rights.

12:38.090 --> 12:41.260
I don't know what that means. But I am in.

12:41.343 --> 12:47.391
It means the loser, you, has to lavish
the winner, me, with praise.

12:47.475 --> 12:53.731
Deal. And when I win, I would like you
to refer to me as "the boy king."

12:59.153 --> 13:02.782
Kahn, you were unbelievable last night!

13:02.865 --> 13:05.201
You made the hairs on my back
stand on end.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.870
Well, if you like that, you should come
see me at karaoke night

13:07.953 --> 13:09.413
at Nine Rivers Country Club.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.540
They asked me to perform
at their fundraiser

13:11.624 --> 13:13.167
to help pay for last fundraiser.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.002
Check it out! I'm headlining!

13:15.711 --> 13:17.379
Wow!

13:17.463 --> 13:20.883
And look at that.
You got top billing over Dith Prou Non?

13:20.966 --> 13:21.967
Yes!

13:22.051 --> 13:24.011
This is gonna be really big show for me.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.262
Even General's coming.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.515
And Minh says he won't wait
in the car this time.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.016
Well, good for you, Kahn.

13:29.099 --> 13:30.643
We're all looking forward to it.

13:30.726 --> 13:33.646
Kahn, I need you to come
and wash my clothes!

13:33.729 --> 13:36.899
They are taking on the smell
of your house.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.234
I'm sorry, General.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.277
But I am talking with my friends now.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.488
Why don't you do it yourself?

13:44.615 --> 13:45.908
Oh.

13:53.707 --> 13:56.252
Well, all right, Kahn. Join us for a beer.

14:02.466 --> 14:07.471
I have four recording devices taped to my
person for bootlegging Kahn's performance.

14:07.555 --> 14:11.600
I'm gonna make a killing down
at the Laotian farmer's market.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.270
Kahn, you perform with such power.

14:14.353 --> 14:17.022
Please tell us about
your karaoke strategy.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.692
In karaoke, you must dominate your song.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.486
-You must...
-Kahn! I would like to perform.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.530
But we already have a program.

14:24.613 --> 14:27.992
-And an approximate time frame.
-No, no.

14:28.075 --> 14:30.953
It's fine, Mitchell. How about this?

14:31.036 --> 14:33.998
I won't do an encore
and General can open for me.

14:37.918 --> 14:41.755
You must say to song,
"I am boss! I am boss!"

14:50.222 --> 14:52.016
Wait. Isn't this...?

14:54.059 --> 14:57.271
<i>♪ There's got to be a morning after ♪</i>

14:57.354 --> 15:01.650
No! That's Kahn's song!
He's stealing Kahn's song!

15:01.734 --> 15:06.238
In the world of karaoke, stealing a
man's song is like sleeping with his wife

15:06.322 --> 15:09.575
and making him listen to it
as others watch and cheer.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.328
<i>♪ Let's keep on looking ♪</i>

15:15.539 --> 15:17.791
<i>♪ Why don't we cross the bridge together ♪</i>

15:18.667 --> 15:23.255
<i>♪ And find a place that's safe and warm? ♪</i>

15:27.801 --> 15:31.263
Well, Kahn,
the gauntlet's been thrown down.

15:31.347 --> 15:36.977
And now for our headlining performer,
Kahn Souphanousinphone!

15:56.330 --> 15:58.415
I can't believe General stole my song!

15:58.499 --> 16:00.167
That monster.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.544
And the worst part is I let him.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.839
I could have gone up on stage
and beat him. But I didn't.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.634
-I'm worthless.
-Amazing.

16:08.717 --> 16:13.013
The General was able to use
Maureen McGovern as a device of torture.

16:13.097 --> 16:17.434
He's just a jackass. Forget about him.
Besides, he's not gonna be here forever.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.436
Yeah, he'll eventually go home.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.230
But I'll still be a failure.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.189
No, you won't.

16:22.272 --> 16:27.861
You'll get back on stage and walk this off
like an athlete that sings.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.406
Kahn!

16:30.489 --> 16:31.824
I gotta run.

16:32.825 --> 16:36.745
We're witnessing our own
"VH1 Behind the Music."

16:36.829 --> 16:39.581
It's just a show until it happens to you.

16:39.707 --> 16:40.749
Dangit.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.167
We got to do something.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.674
I am testing the microphone.

16:48.757 --> 16:51.552
I am testing the microphone.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.307
Hey, Kahn.

16:58.100 --> 17:01.979
Boomhauer had this thing laying around
his bedroom. Come and take a look.

17:03.397 --> 17:06.400
Please, Kahn!
You've got a rainbow in your mouth!

17:06.483 --> 17:07.985
Open it for the world!

17:15.492 --> 17:16.827
Okay, Mom.

17:16.910 --> 17:20.998
You only have one more day for Kahn
to turn back into his old self again.

17:21.081 --> 17:23.959
Oh, he may look like a broken man
right now.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.628
But that's the final stage before jerkdom.

17:31.383 --> 17:36.638
And when I win, just know I like
compliments that are from the neck up.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.478
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

17:42.561 --> 17:44.646
Thank you very much!

17:46.440 --> 17:49.610
-Hit that note!
-Go, girl!

17:54.740 --> 17:57.576
Kahn, you meditating again?

17:59.161 --> 18:01.163
Oh. You want to eat?

18:01.246 --> 18:04.416
Just drop food on my face.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.085
Oh, Kahn.

18:06.168 --> 18:10.714
It's not a big deal that Daddy did
the same song. So what?

18:10.798 --> 18:15.052
Bah. Maybe to you, Minh.
But it was my song.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.686
Daddy, Kahn is hurting.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.396
-You have to do something.
-Ehh!

18:26.480 --> 18:29.983
Do not interrupt me
when Geldorf Muller is pulling.

18:34.154 --> 18:35.489
Ahh...

18:35.572 --> 18:38.325
It's too bad there is not
a world's weakest man.

18:38.408 --> 18:40.911
Because Kahn would be unstoppable.

18:41.912 --> 18:45.958
He's my husband and the father
to your only granddaughter.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.502
You have to talk to him
and make this right.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.056
Please, sit up, son.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.645
I know I've been hard on you.

19:08.438 --> 19:12.401
But I just want you to know
you are a failure.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.572
You are a loser. A nothing.

19:16.655 --> 19:22.828
I am better than you in every way and can
crush you whenever the mood strikes me.

19:24.454 --> 19:28.834
Now, if you accept that,
because you are Minh's husband

19:28.917 --> 19:31.712
I will leave here and let you save face

19:31.795 --> 19:35.799
in front of this inconsequential mix
of bottom dwellers.

19:37.092 --> 19:38.510
Good enough for me!

19:45.267 --> 19:46.685
Ahh...

19:46.768 --> 19:52.107
Kahn, I compliment you
on your success in life.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.152
You are married to my daughter.

19:55.235 --> 19:57.654
And you have a child
which you share with her.

19:58.822 --> 20:01.950
You have achieved things.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.540
I am departing by taxi now.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.393
Well, all right, Kahn.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.312
It's nice to see you in a good mood again.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.272
You want a beer?

20:34.233 --> 20:36.151
I would love a beer...

20:36.235 --> 20:39.446
An import
from my Sub-Zero style refrigerator.

20:39.529 --> 20:42.532
Not domestic swill from hillbilly cooler!

20:43.825 --> 20:44.785
Huh.

20:44.868 --> 20:47.996
Well, looks like we got an extra beer.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.707
-Mm, yep.
-Yep.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.751
Mm-hm.

20:52.834 --> 20:56.713
So what do you think
of your sandwich, Bobby?

20:56.797 --> 21:01.718
I have never had
a better sandwich in all of my life.

21:01.802 --> 21:06.056
-It's as if the meat was touched by God.
-Ah. Yes.

21:06.139 --> 21:09.393
I thought it was gonna be a good sandwich
when I was making it.

21:09.476 --> 21:10.936
How do I look?

21:11.979 --> 21:14.648
Your skin is radiant
and your hair is luxurious.

21:15.649 --> 21:19.820
<i>How jealous other boys must be that
I have such a perfect mom!</i>

21:54.271 --> 21:56.189
-<i>Drag and drop!</i>
<i>But I...</i>

21:56.273 --> 21:57.858
-<i>Drag and drop!</i>
