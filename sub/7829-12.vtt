D'oh!

00:16.057 --> 00:18.101
-Aah!
-(tires screech)

00:36.244 --> 00:37.454
Oh, my God.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.664
The <i>Mad Magazine</i>
Special Edition!

00:39.748 --> 00:42.042
They only put out 17
of these a year!

00:42.125 --> 00:44.377
Boy, they're really
socking it

00:44.461 --> 00:46.421
to that Spiro Agnew
guy again.

00:46.504 --> 00:48.048
He must work there
or something.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.049
Let's do the fold-in.

00:49.132 --> 00:50.592
Okay.

00:50.675 --> 00:53.720
"What higher power
do TV evangelists worship?"

00:53.803 --> 00:54.721
I'll say God.

00:54.804 --> 00:56.056
I'll say Jesus.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.224
BOTH:
The all mighty dollar?

00:58.308 --> 01:00.310
You fold it, you bought it.

01:00.393 --> 01:03.271
Ooh! Snappy answers
to stupid questions.

01:03.354 --> 01:04.731
I'm great at these.

01:04.814 --> 01:06.357
Ask me if something
smells funny in here, boy.

01:06.441 --> 01:08.193
Does something smell
funny in here?

01:08.276 --> 01:10.528
I don't think so...
stupid!

01:10.612 --> 01:12.989
(laughs)

01:13.073 --> 01:14.074
Homey, you want pork chops?

01:14.157 --> 01:16.701
No, I want roast beef,
you clod!

01:16.785 --> 01:19.204
(laughs)

01:19.287 --> 01:22.207
Look at this special insert--
"Iron-on Madness!"

01:22.290 --> 01:23.958
(laughing)
"Ban the bath."

01:24.042 --> 01:26.211
"Don't trust anyone over ten."

01:26.294 --> 01:28.421
"Sock it to me!"

01:28.505 --> 01:30.298
(worried groan)

01:30.381 --> 01:33.885
Those magazines create
a dangerous amount of laughter.

01:33.968 --> 01:36.179
"The all ighty

01:36.262 --> 01:37.180
ollar?"

01:37.263 --> 01:38.515
(laughs)

01:38.598 --> 01:39.724
I get it.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.976
Gee, business
stinks tonight.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.478
Where's Barney, Lenny,
and Carl?

01:43.561 --> 01:45.563
Ah, they never come
around anymore

01:45.647 --> 01:48.233
now that they got
their mistresses.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.235
Ah, might as well
close the dump.

01:50.318 --> 01:51.986
I am going to drink
you under the table.

01:52.070 --> 01:55.073
No, I am going to
drink you under the...

01:55.156 --> 01:56.407
-Aw.
-Aw.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.159
(yawning)
Well, you're closing.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.744
It's getting late.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.704
My kids are probably wondering
where their daddy is.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.124
There's got to be
some other place we can go.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.083
Think, Moe, think!

02:07.836 --> 02:09.129
(voice cracking)
Sorry. It's league night.

02:09.212 --> 02:11.256
I couldn't give a lane
to my own mother.

02:11.339 --> 02:13.091
I have no son.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.137
Man, you go through life,

02:17.220 --> 02:19.139
you try to be nice to people,

02:19.222 --> 02:20.974
you struggle
to resist the urge

02:21.057 --> 02:22.600
to punch 'em in the face
and for what?

02:22.684 --> 02:25.395
For some pimply little puke
to treat you like dirt

02:25.478 --> 02:27.063
unless you're on a team!

02:27.147 --> 02:28.481
Well, I'm better than dirt!

02:28.565 --> 02:30.984
Well, most kinds of dirt.

02:31.067 --> 02:32.902
Not that fancy
store-bought dirt.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.988
That stuff's loaded
with nutrients.

02:35.071 --> 02:36.739
I can't compete
with that stuff.

02:36.823 --> 02:40.118
That I cannot bowl wreaks havoc
with my self-esteem as well.

02:40.201 --> 02:41.494
But who am I
to complain?

02:41.578 --> 02:43.997
I'm tired of being
a wannabe league bowler.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.082
I wanna be a league bowler.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.167
(bell dings)

02:47.250 --> 02:48.168
Hey...

02:48.251 --> 02:49.586
We can be a team.

02:49.669 --> 02:53.631
Excuse me, but my team
is ready to bowl!

02:53.715 --> 02:55.216
You're short one person.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.760
Uh... that
long-haired freak's

02:57.844 --> 02:59.304
bowled with us
for years.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.764
Oh I don't care
if it takes me all night.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.058
I'm going to get me
that lobster harmonica.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.185
Come on, lobstie!

03:05.268 --> 03:06.436
Oh!

03:06.519 --> 03:07.854
Oh, okay.

03:07.937 --> 03:10.190
Then I just need
your $500 registration fee.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.150
$500?

03:12.233 --> 03:13.234
No problem.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.235
Would you take
an out-of-state

03:14.319 --> 03:15.778
two-party bad check?

03:15.862 --> 03:19.032
No, I will not pay you
$500 for sex!

03:19.115 --> 03:20.491
Aw, come on, Marge!

03:20.575 --> 03:22.744
You're getting something
in return

03:22.827 --> 03:25.663
and I'm getting a bowling team.
It's win-win!

03:25.747 --> 03:30.001
It's sick! And I don't have that
kind of money to spend on sex.

03:30.084 --> 03:31.419
Maybe you could get
someone with money

03:31.502 --> 03:34.047
to sponsor your team...
like Mr. Burns.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.798
Burns never gives money
to anybody.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.009
Just last week,
I asked him for $1,500.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.427
For what?

03:39.510 --> 03:41.387
Aw, I gotta get the
third degree from you too?!

03:41.471 --> 03:42.805
Tonight's homework
assignment is...

03:42.889 --> 03:45.433
Oh, man.
Is it hot in here!

03:45.516 --> 03:48.186
I better take off my sweater!

03:48.269 --> 03:49.229
"Down...

03:49.312 --> 03:51.105
"with...

03:51.189 --> 03:52.440
...homework?"

03:52.523 --> 03:54.984
(class laughs)

03:55.068 --> 03:56.611
Don't look at it, children.

03:56.694 --> 03:57.862
The shirt makes
a good point.

03:57.946 --> 03:58.863
I'm with the shirt.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.782
Homework rots.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.033
(chanting)
Down with homework!

04:02.116 --> 04:04.535
Down with homework!

04:04.619 --> 04:05.745
(coughing)

04:09.707 --> 04:11.334
As I was saying,
my yearly evaluation

04:11.417 --> 04:13.253
couldn't have come
at a better time.

04:13.336 --> 04:16.673
Well, Seymour, I must say,
for once I am impressed.

04:16.756 --> 04:18.341
In fact, I am going
to give this school

04:18.424 --> 04:20.009
a perfect 10.

04:20.093 --> 04:24.013
I'll just write
the zero first.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.557
Now a vertical line
to indicate the one...

04:26.641 --> 04:29.143
STUDENTS:
Down with homework!

04:30.436 --> 04:31.896
Skinner!

04:31.980 --> 04:35.942
Why are there children
walking on my head?!

04:36.025 --> 04:38.945
(gasps)

04:39.028 --> 04:41.948
So... we meet again
"Mad Magazine."

04:42.031 --> 04:43.074
How do you know
it's from Mad?

04:43.157 --> 04:44.409
The year was 1968.

04:44.492 --> 04:45.410
We were on recon

04:45.493 --> 04:47.829
in a steaming Mekong delta.

04:47.912 --> 04:50.331
An overheated private
removed his flak jacket

04:50.415 --> 04:51.874
revealing a t-shirt
with an iron-on

04:51.958 --> 04:54.669
sporting the Mad slogan,
"Up with mini-skirts."

04:54.752 --> 04:56.045
Well, we all had a good laugh

04:56.129 --> 04:58.089
even though I didn't
quite understand it.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.590
But our momentary lapse
of concentration

04:59.674 --> 05:02.844
allowed Charlie
to get the drop on us.

05:02.927 --> 05:05.263
I spent the next three years
in a P.O.W. camp

05:05.346 --> 05:07.098
forced to subsist
on a thin stew

05:07.181 --> 05:10.143
made of fish, vegetables,
prawns, coconut milk,

05:10.226 --> 05:12.895
and four kinds of rice.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.230
I came close to madness

05:14.314 --> 05:15.606
trying to find it here
in the states

05:15.690 --> 05:17.108
but they just can't get
the spices right.

05:17.191 --> 05:18.860
Uh, my punishment?

05:18.943 --> 05:21.154
Hmm? Oh. I'm going to have
to think about that.

05:21.237 --> 05:22.238
Meanwhile,
wear this home.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.994
No!

05:28.077 --> 05:29.620
I need some more ether.

05:29.704 --> 05:33.291
I can still feel the movement
of the emery board.

05:33.374 --> 05:34.292
We're fresh out, sir.

05:34.375 --> 05:35.460
I'll get some more.

05:35.543 --> 05:36.919
Leave the rag.

05:37.003 --> 05:37.920
(sniffs)

05:38.004 --> 05:39.255
Mmm!

05:42.884 --> 05:45.136
Uh, excuse me. Mr. Burns?

05:45.219 --> 05:46.721
Poppin' Fresh!

05:46.804 --> 05:48.973
You glutinous
little doughboy!

05:49.057 --> 05:52.060
Oh, there's something I've
wanted to do to you for years!

05:52.143 --> 05:53.936
(giggles)

05:55.104 --> 05:56.564
(giggling)

05:56.647 --> 05:57.774
Ow!

05:57.857 --> 06:00.485
Mr. Burns...
I, uh, was wondering

06:00.568 --> 06:04.781
if you'd like to sponsor
my bowling team for $500.

06:04.864 --> 06:07.116
Oh, why certainly,
Poppin' Fresh.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.368
I owe my robust physique

06:08.451 --> 06:09.744
to your tubes
of triple-bleached goo.

06:09.827 --> 06:11.371
Whoo-hoo!

06:11.454 --> 06:13.164
Hey, everybody!

06:13.247 --> 06:15.583
If you want to ask Burns
for a favor, now's the time!

06:15.666 --> 06:18.336
He's doped up or dying
or something!

06:18.419 --> 06:20.046
Uh, excuse me.

06:20.129 --> 06:22.131
I'd like
to request $17

06:22.215 --> 06:25.176
for a push-broom
rebristling.

06:25.259 --> 06:27.178
Why, it's that delightful
TV leprechaun!

06:27.261 --> 06:30.390
I'm going to get
your Lucky Charms!

06:30.473 --> 06:31.516
(drill grinding)

06:31.599 --> 06:33.393
MOLEMAN:
Oh, no. My brains.

06:50.118 --> 06:54.122
Hey, nice, quote
"uniforms", end quote.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.999
This just in-- a new addition
to our "Worst-Dressed list":

06:57.083 --> 06:57.959
Those guys!

07:02.547 --> 07:04.173
Forget this.
I am far too fragile

07:04.257 --> 07:06.926
to withstand an evening
of barbs like that.

07:07.009 --> 07:08.803
Aw, come on.
If we quit now

07:08.886 --> 07:10.388
we'll never know how badly
they're going to beat us.

07:10.471 --> 07:11.889
Yeah, you're right.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.307
That's the kind of thing
that would haunt you.

07:16.310 --> 07:17.770
<i>Si!</i>

07:17.854 --> 07:20.815
(laughing)
<i>Buenas noches, señoritas.</i>

07:20.898 --> 07:22.066
What did he say?
What did he say?

07:22.150 --> 07:23.234
Was that about me?

07:24.527 --> 07:26.362
Okay, Otto. Pressure's on.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.532
Don't choke, don't choke,
don't choke, don't...

07:29.615 --> 07:30.491
choke!

07:32.243 --> 07:34.454
Oh, man!
I knew I was going to choke.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.289
Well, that's
a funny-looking strike.

07:36.372 --> 07:39.792
Come on, guys, let's be the team
that supports each other.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.837
(cheering) You can do it, Otto!
You can do it, Otto!

07:42.920 --> 07:45.298
"Help each other out"
That'll be our motto.

07:45.381 --> 07:48.468
You can do it, Otto!
You can do it, Otto!

07:48.551 --> 07:50.636
Make this spare,
I give you free Gelato.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.306
Then back to my place,
where I will get you blotto.

07:53.389 --> 07:56.309
Domo aregatto,
Mr. Roboto.

07:56.392 --> 07:59.228
You can do it, Otto!
You can do it...

07:59.312 --> 08:02.148
Guys, I Made the spare. We won.

08:02.231 --> 08:03.649
All right!
Way to go!

08:03.733 --> 08:04.650
We did it!

08:08.905 --> 08:10.823
Those beers are
five dollars apiece.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.791
-Let me set the scene for you, Marge.
-All right.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.878
It's a 7-10 split,
the hardest shot in bowling.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.046
It was all up to me.

08:25.129 --> 08:26.255
Oh!

08:26.339 --> 08:29.133
So I got up all my
courage right away.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.135
My lips started to move

08:31.219 --> 08:34.514
and I came up with the chant
that won the match!

08:34.597 --> 08:35.848
Who knocked down
the pins?

08:35.932 --> 08:38.100
I don't know...
You know, some guy, uh...

08:38.184 --> 08:40.019
Otto, I guess.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.771
Good for him!

08:41.854 --> 08:44.565
Yes, but Marge, you're not--
You're missing the point!

08:44.649 --> 08:47.318
The individual
doesn't matter.

08:47.401 --> 08:48.903
It was a team effort

08:48.986 --> 08:50.363
and I was the one

08:50.446 --> 08:52.073
who came up with
the whole "team" idea!

08:52.156 --> 08:53.658
Me!

08:53.741 --> 08:56.661
I can't believe Otto
picked up a 7-10 split.

08:56.744 --> 08:57.662
He's phenomenal!

08:57.745 --> 08:59.747
-But, but--
-Wow!

08:59.830 --> 09:01.707
Several days ago,
a violent riot erupted

09:01.791 --> 09:04.293
incited by an
inflammatory t-shirt slogan.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.547
No, no, now, don't try to
remember what that slogan was.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.840
To ensure that this frenzied
dance of destruction

09:09.924 --> 09:13.511
is never repeated,
I have decided, starting Monday

09:13.594 --> 09:16.347
all students will be required
to wear uniforms.

09:16.430 --> 09:18.307
ALL:
Uniforms?!!

09:22.436 --> 09:24.355
(Herb Alpert & Tijuana Brass'
"Spanish Flea" playing)

09:24.438 --> 09:26.566
Say hello to our
little genius Martin

09:26.649 --> 09:28.234
who looks even smarter

09:28.317 --> 09:30.361
in this vest
and short pant combination

09:30.444 --> 09:32.280
from Mr. Boy
of Main Street.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.867
Or how about
little Lisa Simpson?

09:36.951 --> 09:39.203
She'll have no reason
to play the blues

09:39.287 --> 09:41.163
in this snappy ensemble

09:41.247 --> 09:43.332
topped off with
a saucy French beret

09:43.416 --> 09:46.669
that seems to
scream, "silence."

09:52.758 --> 09:55.803
All right, pick your size:
"extra-small" or "extra-large."

09:55.886 --> 09:57.096
We've got both.

09:57.179 --> 09:58.931
No pushing now, I-- What?

09:59.015 --> 10:01.767
Oh, I've just been informed
we've run out of "extra-large."

10:01.851 --> 10:04.145
Go, Moe! Go, Moe!

10:04.228 --> 10:05.730
Don't make Homer
shout out "D'oh!"

10:07.523 --> 10:08.691
(cheering)

10:08.774 --> 10:11.152
Woo-hoo!

10:16.073 --> 10:18.451
-(pins clatter)
-(cheering)

10:18.534 --> 10:20.494
All right, Snake,
make us proud.

10:25.249 --> 10:27.209
One, two, three...

10:27.293 --> 10:30.796
(rapidly) four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten. Bye!

10:30.880 --> 10:33.090
Uh... we forfeit.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.133
(cheering)

10:40.139 --> 10:43.643
There it is, boys:
the Championship Trophy.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.645
We will never possess it.

10:45.728 --> 10:48.731
The Holy Rollers have won it
five years in a row.

10:48.814 --> 10:51.233
MOE: They think they're
so high and mighty

10:51.317 --> 10:53.736
just 'cause they never got caught
driving without pants.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.449
(ridiculing laughter)

10:58.532 --> 11:00.409
God-boy couldn't get a strike!

11:00.493 --> 11:03.245
(laughing)

11:03.329 --> 11:05.414
It's me-- Ned.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.707
(laughing)

11:06.791 --> 11:08.417
(screaming)

11:08.501 --> 11:12.254
Mom! My slingshot doesn't
fit in these pockets!

11:12.338 --> 11:14.382
And these shorts leave
nothing to the imagination.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.300
These uniforms suck.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.552
Bart, where do you pick up
words like that?

11:18.636 --> 11:20.304
Yeah, Moe, that team
sure did suck last night.

11:20.388 --> 11:21.389
They just plain sucked!

11:21.472 --> 11:23.099
I've seen teams suck before

11:23.182 --> 11:25.101
but they were the suckiest
bunch of sucks

11:25.184 --> 11:26.102
that ever sucked.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.687
Homer! Watch your mouth!

11:27.770 --> 11:29.605
Got to go. My damn wiener
kids are listening.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.315
We are not wieners!

11:31.399 --> 11:32.692
Then what are you
dressed like that for?

11:32.775 --> 11:34.110
BOTH:
They made us.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.529
"Oh, they made us."
That's loser talk.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.823
You got to start acting
more like me and my team--

11:38.906 --> 11:41.033
the future league champions
of the world.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.369
Nothing's going to stop us now.

11:43.452 --> 11:44.954
Stop everything.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.706
I don't remember
writing a check for bowling.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.999
Sir, that's a check
for your "boweling."

11:49.083 --> 11:51.252
Oh, yes.
That's very important.

11:51.335 --> 11:52.712
Yes, sir. Remember that
month you didn't do it?

11:52.795 --> 11:55.297
Yes. That was unpleasant
for all concerned.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.341
Anyway, back to the checks...

11:57.425 --> 11:58.759
Stop everything!

11:58.843 --> 12:01.262
I don't remember
writing a check for bowling!

12:01.345 --> 12:04.640
Hmm... the memo says
"To my pal, Poppin' Fresh."

12:04.724 --> 12:07.685
Oh, yes... that greedy,
grasping glob of chemicals.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.729
Probably one of your ether-induced
hallucinations, sir.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.272
I'll check
the employee files

12:11.355 --> 12:12.481
to see who
could pull off

12:12.565 --> 12:14.567
such an impersonation.

12:14.650 --> 12:17.111
Hmm, it was either
Pops Freshenmeyer...

12:20.239 --> 12:21.323
or Homer Simpson.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.370
Simpson, eh?

12:26.454 --> 12:29.415
Let's shut down this
bowling scam right now.

12:34.336 --> 12:36.130
Come on, Homer.
Come on, Homer.

12:36.213 --> 12:38.215
Pretend this is baseball
and hit us a Homer!

12:40.593 --> 12:42.386
-Way to go!
-Yeah! Yeah!

12:42.470 --> 12:45.681
-Way to roll it.
-Yes, sir! Oh, yes.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.725
By the way, rhyming "Homer"
with "Homer"--

12:47.808 --> 12:49.393
(making Italian kissing sound)

12:49.477 --> 12:52.563
Look at them, Smithers,
enjoying their embezzlement.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.356
I have a much uglier word
for it, sir:

12:54.440 --> 12:56.942
"misappropriation."

12:57.026 --> 12:57.902
Simpson!

12:59.111 --> 13:00.029
(gasps, man screams)

13:00.112 --> 13:01.906
Listen here...

13:01.989 --> 13:03.407
I want to join
your team.

13:03.491 --> 13:04.533
You want to
join my what?

13:04.617 --> 13:05.868
You wanna "what"
his team?

13:05.951 --> 13:06.869
I've had one of
my unpredictable

13:06.952 --> 13:08.245
changes of heart.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.872
Seeing these
fine young athletes

13:09.955 --> 13:12.708
reveling in the humiliation
of a vanquished foe...

13:12.792 --> 13:16.295
I haven't felt this energized
since my last...

13:16.378 --> 13:17.797
boweling.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.548
Oh, man, he'll blow
our winning streak.

13:19.632 --> 13:23.552
Yeah... call this an unfair
generalization if you must

13:23.636 --> 13:26.013
but old people are
no good at everything.

13:26.096 --> 13:28.349
Look, guys, it's not
that simple-- he's my boss.

13:28.432 --> 13:29.391
I'll tell you what.

13:29.475 --> 13:30.893
I'll give him a shot

13:30.976 --> 13:34.230
and if he stinks
it'll be easier to tell him no.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.606
(grunting and groaning)

13:40.903 --> 13:42.571
(panting)

13:42.655 --> 13:43.781
(muttering)

13:49.411 --> 13:50.996
Welcome aboard.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.206
(softly)
It wasn't any easier.

13:59.213 --> 14:01.507
Ah, these uniforms
are a godsend.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.217
Horseplay
is down 40%.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.010
Youthful exuberance
has been cut in half,

14:05.094 --> 14:07.596
and high spirits
are at an all-time low.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.974
They've even begun
blinking in unison.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.018
I love that sound.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.020
Now, children

14:15.104 --> 14:17.231
while you're having quiet time
I'm going to make sure my desk

14:17.314 --> 14:19.358
is exactly parallel
to the rear wall.

14:24.154 --> 14:27.908
Oh, there's something
I used to do

14:27.992 --> 14:29.952
in this situation.

14:30.035 --> 14:33.664
But... can't... remember.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.791
Ha ho?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.334
Whoa, I can't believe

14:37.418 --> 14:39.295
I got booted off the team
for Mr. Businessman.

14:39.378 --> 14:40.421
(snorts)

14:40.504 --> 14:41.505
I bet I'll get
a little respect

14:41.589 --> 14:43.257
once I get that
Harvard diploma.

14:54.602 --> 14:55.811
Look at that!

14:55.895 --> 14:58.105
All the way to the end
with only one push.

14:58.188 --> 15:00.691
Ah, that's the third game
in a row he cost us, Homer.

15:01.817 --> 15:02.735
Mama mia!

15:02.818 --> 15:03.736
Hoot mon!

15:03.819 --> 15:05.654
Yee haw!

15:05.738 --> 15:07.114
Arr, me maties.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.532
Arr!

15:08.616 --> 15:10.701
Whoo! They begged me
to join their team.

15:10.784 --> 15:11.660
Begged me.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.706
Well, we certainly
got walloped tonight

15:15.789 --> 15:16.999
eh, fellas?

15:17.082 --> 15:18.000
(laughs)

15:18.083 --> 15:19.126
Ow!

15:19.209 --> 15:20.127
Well... ow!

15:20.210 --> 15:21.837
Uh, Mr. Burns, next week

15:21.921 --> 15:23.672
is the big
championship game...

15:23.756 --> 15:26.759
Ah, yes, that silly
championship...

15:26.842 --> 15:29.762
The only "ship" worth a damn
is friendship.

15:29.845 --> 15:32.097
Look, here comes
the friend ship

15:32.181 --> 15:33.933
sailing your way.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.142
Ooh, here.

15:35.225 --> 15:36.101
Let me get that,
friend.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.271
Oops, lost a nail.

15:39.355 --> 15:40.856
Well, that's leprosy
for you.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.204
You're "it."

15:56.413 --> 15:57.581
Now you are the one
who is "it."

15:57.665 --> 15:59.124
Understood.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.542
Well, I've got to hand it
to you, Seymour.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.670
These drab student coverings

16:02.753 --> 16:05.756
have created the perfect
distraction-free environment

16:05.839 --> 16:08.300
thus preparing the children
for permanent positions

16:08.384 --> 16:11.387
in tomorrow's mills
and processing facilities.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.098
Best of all, with less than
a minute to go before I leave

16:14.181 --> 16:16.892
absolutely nothing
has gone wrong.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.102
(thunder rumbling)

16:19.645 --> 16:21.522
Well, it is
starting to rain

16:21.605 --> 16:23.941
but I can hardly be blamed
for that, can I?

16:24.024 --> 16:26.819
(both laughing)

16:26.902 --> 16:28.570
Yes, very good.

16:37.871 --> 16:40.541
Wow, look at all
the colors, man!

16:40.624 --> 16:42.334
Red, green,
yellow, orange.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.836
I remember all of these.

16:43.919 --> 16:46.588
I'm freakin' out!

16:46.672 --> 16:49.717
Hey, something's
coming back to me.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.969
Down with homework.

16:52.052 --> 16:53.637
And down with uniforms.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.097
(cheering)

17:00.477 --> 17:02.062
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

17:02.146 --> 17:03.522
Skinner!

17:03.605 --> 17:06.025
Why aren't these
uniforms colorfast?

17:06.108 --> 17:07.776
I don't understand it.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.737
I got them at the same place
I buy mother's dresses.

17:09.820 --> 17:12.823
Good Lord, Mother's in the park.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.658
Now this, I gotta see.

17:14.742 --> 17:18.120
Aw, Marge, we were so close
to winning the championship.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.622
Now, thanks to Burns,
it's never going to happen.

17:20.706 --> 17:24.126
And I spent so much time
building that trophy case.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.882
Homer, maybe Mr. Burns
will bowl a great game

17:29.965 --> 17:32.051
and you will win
your championship.

17:32.134 --> 17:35.179
So you're saying
we're definitely going to win?

17:35.262 --> 17:36.430
Whoo-hoo!

17:36.513 --> 17:38.682
I won't need this
any more!

17:38.766 --> 17:42.311
(toilet flushing repeatedly)

17:44.688 --> 17:47.524
Marge, someone
broke the toilet.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.034
Don't worry
about nothing, Homer.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.369
I have a feeling
that Mr. Burns

17:59.453 --> 18:01.830
is going to have
a little accident

18:01.914 --> 18:02.831
that might keep him

18:02.915 --> 18:04.833
from bowling
with us tonight.

18:04.917 --> 18:05.876
Heh, heh, heh.

18:09.755 --> 18:10.881
Smithers, I'm afraid

18:10.964 --> 18:12.716
I won't be able
to play tonight.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.677
My old gimpy knee
has gone akimbo again.

18:15.761 --> 18:16.887
Take that!

18:16.970 --> 18:19.848
Ooh... Smithers.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.017
That precision assault
popped it back into place.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.769
Thank you, masked stranger.

18:23.852 --> 18:25.270
D'oh, he's gonna
ruin everything.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.313
All right, that's it, Homer.

18:26.396 --> 18:28.524
Either Burns goes or Moe goes.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.234
Yes, I am afraid that I am
going to have to make

18:30.317 --> 18:31.652
a similar threat

18:31.735 --> 18:33.237
with my name
in place of Moe's name.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.822
So, who's ready
to kick

18:34.905 --> 18:36.115
some Christian
keister?

18:36.198 --> 18:39.952
Oh, uh, Mr. Burns,
as team captain

18:40.035 --> 18:42.412
it's my duty
to inform you that...

18:42.496 --> 18:43.831
Oh, I almost forgot.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.457
I brought you all
a little something.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.211
Aw, would you look at that?

18:49.294 --> 18:51.088
"The Pin Pals."

18:51.171 --> 18:52.589
(gasps)

18:52.673 --> 18:54.216
At last, I finally
have a garment

18:54.299 --> 18:55.884
fine enough to be married in.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.719
I've always been wealthy

18:57.803 --> 19:01.140
but this is the first time
I ever felt rich.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.891
Aww!

19:02.975 --> 19:04.893
Now Homer, you were about
to say something to me?

19:04.977 --> 19:06.937
You're off
the team.

19:07.020 --> 19:07.980
What?

19:08.063 --> 19:09.648
(nervous laughter)

19:09.731 --> 19:10.774
Homer!

19:10.858 --> 19:12.359
He's just ribbing you, Monty.

19:12.442 --> 19:15.988
-Yes!
-Oh-oh-oh, you guys.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.118
(grunt)

19:23.203 --> 19:24.913
Hey-hey-hey!

19:34.256 --> 19:35.465
Hallelujah!

19:35.549 --> 19:37.968
-Hey!
-Hallelujah!

19:39.094 --> 19:39.970
-Oh!
-Oh!

19:45.893 --> 19:46.935
Nice one, Homer.

19:47.019 --> 19:47.895
Thanks.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.567
Okay, the Holy Rollers are ahead
by one pin.

19:53.650 --> 19:56.904
And we only have
one bowler left: Mr. Burns.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.707
(grunts)

20:11.251 --> 20:13.837
Next time, a few steps more
toward center, don't you think?

20:13.921 --> 20:15.797
Goodbye,
trophy.

20:25.515 --> 20:28.685
Whoa! Whatever I got
a hold of, it's big.

20:38.862 --> 20:39.821
(grunting)

20:44.243 --> 20:45.244
Yes!

20:45.327 --> 20:46.203
Excellent!

20:48.038 --> 20:49.998
Yes!

20:50.082 --> 20:51.583
(plays harmonica note)

20:51.667 --> 20:53.919
Whoo-hoo! We won! We won!

21:00.133 --> 21:01.218
You mean I won.

21:01.301 --> 21:03.011
But we were
a team, sir.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.346
Oh, I'm afraid I've had one

21:04.429 --> 21:05.973
of my trademark
changes of heart.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.183
You see teamwork
will only take you so far

21:08.267 --> 21:09.810
then the truly evolved person

21:09.893 --> 21:12.688
makes that extra grab
for personal glory. Now...

21:12.771 --> 21:14.398
I must discard
my teammates

21:14.481 --> 21:15.649
much like the boxer

21:15.732 --> 21:17.067
must shed roll
after roll

21:17.150 --> 21:18.485
of sweaty, useless,
disgusting flab

21:18.568 --> 21:21.113
before he can win
the title. Ta!

21:21.196 --> 21:23.865
I guess some people
never change.

21:23.949 --> 21:27.703
Or they quickly change
and then quickly change back.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.037
You know what?

21:29.121 --> 21:30.914
We don't need him
or his trophy.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.041
We got each other,
huh?

21:33.125 --> 21:35.919
Yeah, that's right, Moe.
