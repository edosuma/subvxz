WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.271
Previously on Scorpion...
Mark Collins?

00:03.304 --> 00:04.705
He was a member of the team.
It didn't work out.

00:04.738 --> 00:07.341
Kicking me off Scorpion,
it was a deep betrayal.

00:07.375 --> 00:10.144
CABE: If I uncuff him
without a direct order,

00:10.178 --> 00:13.214
I violate a half a dozen
federal statutes.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.448
What we're doing
is more important.

00:19.853 --> 00:20.788
Collins!

00:20.821 --> 00:22.290
(cackles)

00:22.323 --> 00:24.358
You're under arrest
for instigating an escape.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.394
I want a lawyer.
I want to be your attorney.

00:26.427 --> 00:27.761
You want to what?
I can do this.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.830
I want a family.
I've always wanted a family.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.200
And I want one with you.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.802
'Cause I love you.

00:34.835 --> 00:37.105
TOBY (Southern accent):
And what did you observe

00:37.138 --> 00:38.406
Mark Collins doing

00:38.439 --> 00:41.209
prior to unlocking
his stun cuff?

00:41.242 --> 00:43.511
Well, I felt like
he wasn't a threat to run.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.413
Who cares what you feel?
He asked what you observed.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.115
The judge is gonna
nail you for that.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.250
Run it again.
Mr. Gallo,

00:49.283 --> 00:50.751
why did you
feel it was

00:50.784 --> 00:54.688
necessary to unlock
the prisoner's stun cuff?

00:54.722 --> 00:56.157
Look, I didn't think
he was gonna run.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.426
He was faking an ankle injury.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.761
Not what he asked. Answer
what is asked and nothing more.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.196
It's not my fault!

01:02.230 --> 01:03.697
Foghorn Leghorn
is throwing me off!

01:03.731 --> 01:06.767
I resent, I say, I say,
I resent that remark.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.236
SYLVESTER:
Toby is playing

01:08.269 --> 01:10.104
your attorney.
If you're thrown off by him,

01:10.138 --> 01:12.406
how are you gonna handle a prosecutor?
WALTER: Well, I suggest

01:12.440 --> 01:14.108
that we find out.

01:14.142 --> 01:16.144
Now, Agent Gallo,
you purport to be

01:16.177 --> 01:17.778
some kind of a
lawman, do you not?

01:17.811 --> 01:19.380
You know I'm a federal agent,
Walter.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.482
Yes, one on suspension.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.184
Anyway, I was
wondering why you,

01:23.217 --> 01:26.154
a lawman, continually consort
with criminals?

01:26.187 --> 01:28.222
(chuckles): I don't consort
with criminals. Do you

01:28.256 --> 01:31.225
or do you not, on a daily basis,
associate with...

01:31.259 --> 01:32.560
an illegal gambler...

01:32.593 --> 01:34.228
(normal voice):
Former illegal gambler.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.796
...the daughter of a jailbird...

01:35.829 --> 01:38.232
Only my dad. Mom was clean.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.234
...and the daughter of
a con woman currently on the run

01:40.268 --> 01:41.369
from the authorities?

01:41.402 --> 01:42.436
That's pretty accurate.
Even your lawyer

01:42.470 --> 01:44.705
committed cybertheft
against a bank in his youth.

01:44.738 --> 01:47.308
Man, even I think
he's guilty now.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.710
Look, I'm not,
and that's what I want to say.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.345
Well, you can say that
to your cellmate.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.913
(sighs)

01:52.946 --> 01:55.549
CABE:
You know, what kind of system

01:55.583 --> 01:57.885
would twist the words
of an innocent man and put him

01:57.918 --> 01:59.887
in jail? (Southern accent):
Well, in the immortal words

01:59.920 --> 02:02.590
of Mr. Atticus Finch...
Doc, your ass better be

02:02.623 --> 02:05.259
a size 12, because that's
the size shoe I'm wearing!

02:05.293 --> 02:08.496
Cabe, do you see how worked up

02:08.529 --> 02:10.764
you get?
This role-playing,

02:10.798 --> 02:11.899
it confirms my position:

02:11.932 --> 02:13.901
you have no business
taking the stand.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.803
The trial's
in a few days.

02:15.836 --> 02:19.273
Can we just end this charade so
I can focus on the task at hand?

02:19.307 --> 02:22.176
I need a breather.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.914
Walter, I'm gonna work on my
opening statement in your loft.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.349
TOBY: Walt, I know we're
trying to make a point here,

02:28.382 --> 02:30.851
but... "Say it
to your cellmate"?

02:30.884 --> 02:32.253
That's a little rough, yeah?

02:32.286 --> 02:34.222
Cabe can take it.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.929
It's getting pretty tense
around here.

02:41.962 --> 02:42.963
Can say that again.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.266
What do you think
of Walt dragging us into it,

02:45.299 --> 02:47.201
like we're cut from
criminal cloth or something?

02:47.235 --> 02:48.302
It's uncalled for.

02:48.336 --> 02:49.570
It's ridiculous.
Nonsense.

02:49.603 --> 02:50.638
Malarkey.

02:50.671 --> 02:51.905
Kind of true though.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.541
I mean, we do have some gangster
in our blood.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.810
Moving on,
how is the fixin'

02:56.844 --> 02:57.911
of the comms
coming along?

02:57.945 --> 03:00.714
Link system on these buggers
is still unresponsive.

03:00.748 --> 03:03.751
Even Sly's backup microwave band
is D.O.A.

03:03.784 --> 03:06.320
No case today.
You have time.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.256
Oh, speaking of time,

03:08.289 --> 03:10.258
uh, and how a ton
of it has passed

03:10.291 --> 03:12.293
and you're still not harboring
a fetal fugitive,

03:12.326 --> 03:14.328
um, I've been doing
some research.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.296
No.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.465
I found a very interesting study
out of Russia.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.466
Nyet.
It said that mild

03:18.499 --> 03:20.901
limitations of blood flow
to the extremities

03:20.934 --> 03:22.903
can redirect blood
to the gootius maximus

03:22.936 --> 03:25.673
and increase chances
of pregnancy by two percent.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.774
You want to tie me up?

03:26.807 --> 03:28.276
What?

03:28.309 --> 03:30.578
No. 'Course not.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.247
We would tie each other up.

03:33.281 --> 03:34.948
Sicko.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.551
"Love is the Tie that Binds"?

03:37.585 --> 03:38.652
Deviant.

03:38.686 --> 03:39.787
CABE:
Damn it, Walter!

03:39.820 --> 03:41.289
Are you kidding me?!

03:41.322 --> 03:42.155
I'm gonna deal with that.

03:42.189 --> 03:44.292
We're not done
with the conversation.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.826
Whatever, Mr. Grey.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.562
(phone rings)

03:48.596 --> 03:50.431
Yep.

03:50.464 --> 03:53.267
You care to explain this? These
are pears, those are plums.

03:53.301 --> 03:54.968
Don't be a wise guy.
TOBY: Hey, all right.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.970
Let's all simmer down.
Everybody's a bit on edge today.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.972
I'm not on edge.
I just want a banana.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.808
I wrote "banana"
on the fridge list.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.343
Walt did the shopping

04:02.376 --> 04:04.044
this week, and,
lo and behold,

04:04.077 --> 04:05.879
no banana.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.448
It is a high caloric fruit
loaded with carbs.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.683
I was trying to be helpful.
You want to be helpful?

04:09.717 --> 04:11.752
Then get me the damn fruit
I asked for.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.023
Wha...?

04:16.056 --> 04:17.858
What the hell just happened?

04:17.891 --> 04:20.461
Walter's psychology
is playing out.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.062
Think about it.
Trial's coming up.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.931
Walter's sharp on
cross-examination.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.766
Then he pokes the
bear with produce.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.034
HAPPY: Crap!
(clattering)

04:27.067 --> 04:29.737
Oh, when it
rains, it pours.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.005
Couldn't help
but overhear you

04:32.039 --> 04:33.106
shouting "crap."

04:33.140 --> 04:35.976
I just hung up with
Piker Forest Search and Rescue

04:36.009 --> 04:37.345
in New Mexico.
They want us

04:37.378 --> 04:38.979
to get out there
with my winch today.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.349
I scheduled that presentation
for three weeks from now.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.182
HAPPY:
I know.

04:42.215 --> 04:43.517
Which is why my winch
isn't ready

04:43.551 --> 04:44.918
for a full demonstration.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.454
What's the hurry?
A rockslide blocked

04:46.487 --> 04:48.389
the only access road out
of the valley,

04:48.422 --> 04:50.424
and they're expecting
a big storm in three days.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.759
They're worried
about getting emergency vehicles

04:51.792 --> 04:53.461
through the canyon?
Bingo.

04:53.494 --> 04:56.096
So they want us to clear the
boulders before the storm comes.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.366
But they're a rescue unit.
Don't they have their own winch?

04:58.399 --> 05:01.435
Not like mine; it's
a fluxed cylindrical diameter

05:01.469 --> 05:04.805
creating twice the lift capacity
with half the force applied.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.440
I could flick
those boulders off the road

05:06.474 --> 05:08.342
like a couple of dusty boogers.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.477
Ew.
But I don't like

05:09.510 --> 05:11.412
working out my gear
until it's ready.

05:11.445 --> 05:14.748
So I told the boob from
New Mexico I'd think about it,

05:14.782 --> 05:16.550
and I hung up on him.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.085
We can't afford to lose
this job.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.389
Paige, smooth things
over with them,

05:21.422 --> 05:22.956
tell them we're
on our way.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.493
(scoffs softly)

05:25.526 --> 05:28.629
But... we don't all need to go.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.498
Maybe some of us
can stay back with Cabe,

05:30.531 --> 05:33.467
lend moral support as
he preps for his trial.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.068
That's a construct.
There's nothing moral

05:35.102 --> 05:36.470
about Cabe's predicament.

05:36.504 --> 05:39.139
Paige, Sly can hang back
and work with me.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.508
I'll be fine.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.375
See?

05:41.409 --> 05:42.576
He's fine.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.378
I see you're enjoying that plum.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.914
It's the poor man's peach.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.853
â™ª

05:52.886 --> 05:54.855
WALTER:
Where is the ranger?

05:54.888 --> 05:56.957
He said he'd meet us here.
That's what the dude at

05:56.990 --> 05:58.692
the rescue team station told us.

05:58.726 --> 06:01.028
He also told us that he used
this government truck

06:01.061 --> 06:03.431
to rescue two bears
from a flash flood.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.165
Not sure he's a source
of reliable info.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.067
Actually, we're really early,
so we should get to it.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.569
'Cause the faster
we get back to L.A.,

06:08.602 --> 06:10.003
the faster I can check on Cabe.

06:10.037 --> 06:13.474
Please. He's going to trial,
not to war. (scoffs)

06:13.507 --> 06:15.743
Hey, we're all stressed
about Cabe...

06:15.776 --> 06:17.645
At least some of us are.
...but let's focus

06:17.678 --> 06:20.748
on making sure my winch
passes today's test

06:20.781 --> 06:22.750
with flying colors.
If Search and Rescue

06:22.783 --> 06:25.753
likes what they see,
the State of New Mexico

06:25.786 --> 06:28.689
will be our first
large-scale buyer.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.825
Then this sucker will get into
sporting good stores nationwide,

06:31.859 --> 06:33.427
sell online,

06:33.461 --> 06:35.763
and Scorpion's money woes
are over.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.431
Our financial cupboard is bare,

06:37.465 --> 06:39.433
and Lord knows
we're not filling it

06:39.467 --> 06:40.868
with any of Walter's inventions.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.036
I beg your pardon.
My hot dog invention,

06:43.070 --> 06:45.205
now known as the "Walter O'Brien
Center Cut Meat Tube..."

06:45.238 --> 06:46.974
What happened to "U-Dog"?
It seems

06:47.007 --> 06:49.510
that there is another patent
for, uh, a hot dog

06:49.543 --> 06:50.844
with a less efficient,

06:50.878 --> 06:52.980
much more shallow
condiment channel,

06:53.013 --> 06:55.215
and some scaredy-cat lawyers
won't allow me to use "U-Dog."

06:55.248 --> 06:57.518
I even had
to rewrite the jingle.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.552
Oh, please don't.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.520
â™ª It's a Meat Tube

06:59.553 --> 07:00.888
â™ª Pretty sweet tube

07:00.921 --> 07:03.524
â™ª It's a jump up
and get on your feet tube â™ª

07:03.557 --> 07:05.759
â™ª It's a Walter O'Brien
Center Cut Meat Tube, it's... â™ª

07:09.897 --> 07:11.532
What do you think?

07:11.565 --> 07:14.067
I think, for a genius, you sing
about your wiener a lot.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.235
CABE:
So, finding

07:15.268 --> 07:17.605
anything that will help?
Trying.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.907
You've had your nose in that
book for the last three hours.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.909
What you looking for?
Prison regulations

07:21.942 --> 07:23.577
regarding medical care
for inmates.

07:23.611 --> 07:25.245
If our Eighth Amendment argument
doesn't fly,

07:25.278 --> 07:26.814
then I want to have backup.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.248
Good, good. That's good.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.850
Except the law states

07:29.883 --> 07:32.620
that prisoners only need
to receive "adequate" care.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.555
And since the stun
cuff only caused

07:34.588 --> 07:36.023
temporary and nonlethal pain,

07:36.056 --> 07:38.526
then prosecution could argue
that removing the cuff

07:38.559 --> 07:39.560
went beyond the care

07:39.593 --> 07:41.729
that was necessary.
You know what might work?

07:41.762 --> 07:43.564
You letting me work
without interruptions?

07:43.597 --> 07:46.199
Excuse me if your "no wins, no
losses" record in the courtroom

07:46.233 --> 07:47.935
doesn't fill me with confidence.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.738
(alarm beeping)

07:50.771 --> 07:52.640
What the hell was that?

07:52.673 --> 07:54.141
Nothing.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.576
My tea's ready.

08:08.622 --> 08:09.857
(beeping)
We found him?

08:09.890 --> 08:11.725
I can't believe we found him.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.561
Found who?
Yosemite Sam!

08:13.594 --> 08:16.163
(exhales)
You scared me.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.197
Found who?

08:17.230 --> 08:18.532
Uh...

08:18.566 --> 08:19.733
you know, it...

08:19.767 --> 08:21.201
Technically, it's "found whom."

08:21.234 --> 08:22.870
Kid!
Collins.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.538
We may have found Mark Collins.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.109
I got to say, Happy,
that winch worked great.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.678
It was a fantastic invention.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.012
It's no mutilated hot dog.

08:32.045 --> 08:35.949
Man, New Mexico
is beauty-ful!

08:35.983 --> 08:37.818
I haven't been here
in years.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.920
When were you
in New Mexico?

08:39.953 --> 08:42.055
Oh. My old New York bookie,
The Gooch,

08:42.089 --> 08:45.025
he was a little unhappy with me.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.594
I had to lay low
for a while,

08:46.627 --> 08:48.562
so I hobo-trained it
to Santa Fe.

08:48.596 --> 08:51.765
Oh. Can't wait for you to be
the father of my child.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.702
Still getting the
ranger's voicemail.

08:54.735 --> 08:55.836
We're not waiting for him
anymore. He's a half hour late.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.672
We need to get back. So I'll
just bill him. Let's hit it.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.340
That was boring
and uneventful.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.275
Just the kind of case I like.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.878
(plane engine sputtering)

09:04.912 --> 09:06.614
HAPPY:
Listen to that engine.

09:06.647 --> 09:07.848
Plane's not gonna make it.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.785
(plane crashes)

09:11.819 --> 09:13.754
So much for
"boring and uneventful."

09:13.787 --> 09:14.855
WALTER:
There's no explosion.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.856
There's a good chance
of survival.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.025
Call Search and Rescue!
PAIGE: Already on it.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.893
What a shock-- no answer.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.162
Government employees not doing
their job. What a surprise.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.598
Well, I know one government
employee we can count on.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.667
(phone vibrating)

09:26.700 --> 09:28.836
SYLVESTER: Well, Walt and I
built this supercomputer.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.371
It's constantly searching
for anything that could alert us

09:31.404 --> 09:32.906
to Collins' whereabouts:

09:32.940 --> 09:34.675
his name entered in a database,

09:34.708 --> 09:36.710
algorithm that calculates
a behavioral pattern

09:36.744 --> 09:37.945
that he could fall into,

09:37.978 --> 09:41.248
facial recognition software from
security cameras-- airports,

09:41.281 --> 09:42.983
train stations, banks.

09:43.016 --> 09:46.153
We also keep a tab on
his finances and his relatives.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.655
We call it CLAM:

09:47.688 --> 09:50.257
the Collins Location
and Apprehension Module.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.260
And that's why you guys
wouldn't let us in here.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.162
Walt said
it was because of mold.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.798
No. Just CLAM.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.132
(sighs)
Cabe's not answering either.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.968
I wish we had the comms.
Hey, I have been

10:01.001 --> 10:02.369
working on them all week.
I wish they came

10:02.402 --> 10:04.071
with an insurance plan,
but they didn't.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.706
Never get insurance
on electronics.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.641
It's a sucker's bet.
Shut up.

10:07.675 --> 10:08.909
Yes, dear.
Okay, let's get headed

10:08.942 --> 10:09.810
over that ridge.
We're gonna have

10:09.843 --> 10:13.013
to help those people
on our own for now.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.715
CABE:
So how can a handful

10:14.748 --> 10:16.183
of servers like this

10:16.216 --> 10:18.686
be enough computing power
to analyze

10:18.719 --> 10:20.020
all the data
you're collecting?

10:20.053 --> 10:22.355
Well, we might be
siphoning CPU power

10:22.389 --> 10:23.757
from other government programs

10:23.791 --> 10:26.694
that aren't
necessarily essential.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.762
Doesn't sound legal. Uh, one of the
reasons why we can't send a cop

10:28.796 --> 10:31.832
to investigate any of the leads
that CLAM provides.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.867
That's what that alarm was.
It was a lead.

10:33.901 --> 10:37.204
Well, a pawn shop in Santa
Barbara contacted the Feds about

10:37.237 --> 10:39.006
a purchase of vintage
and rare radio parts.

10:39.039 --> 10:42.743
They can be modified to act
as transmitters in IEDs.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.813
Any sale of these items
needs to be reported to the ATF.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.748
And Collins is a radio specialist.
Exactly.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.918
So he could've found these parts
at a garage sale or a swap meet

10:50.951 --> 10:53.721
and known they were valuable.
And he's on the run,

10:53.754 --> 10:55.856
he's desperate for cash.
He sells 'em to a pawn shop,

10:55.889 --> 10:57.290
and he's got some folding money.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.826
And CLAM caught it
because we have it searching

10:58.859 --> 11:01.795
for anything weird in the
world of radio markets.

11:01.829 --> 11:02.930
All right,
so what's next?

11:02.963 --> 11:06.934
Well... I will direct all
of CLAM's computing power

11:06.967 --> 11:08.702
to Santa Barbara. So...

11:08.736 --> 11:11.371
if Collins is there,
we're gonna catch him.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.206
MAN:
Over here!

11:13.240 --> 11:15.342
Help! Okay, honey,
help is here.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.010
I'll check the passengers.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.846
Grab the water from the back.
Got it.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.714
Uh, I'm a doctor.
What can you tell me?

11:20.748 --> 11:22.215
I'm Frank.
My daughter Jessie

11:22.249 --> 11:23.784
got knocked out when
the plane crashed.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.753
Her leg is mangled.
TOBY: Fib fracture.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.154
It's impacted.
I can set it,

11:27.187 --> 11:28.989
but when she wakes up,
that's gonna hurt like hell.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.791
She got a concussion

11:30.824 --> 11:33.326
upon impact, but her vitals
are steady, so she'll be okay.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.863
It's best if I set this
before she wakes up.

11:38.866 --> 11:39.733
(bones cracking)

11:39.767 --> 11:42.069
Who are you people?

11:42.102 --> 11:43.103
We're federal contractors
out here

11:43.136 --> 11:45.238
to clear a rockslide
caused by the same wind shears

11:45.272 --> 11:47.207
that most likely
made your plane crash.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.242
HAPPY: What happened?
We were on a family trip.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.178
I lost control.
We only had one chute,

11:51.211 --> 11:52.512
so I sent Elijah.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.914
Elijah?
My son.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.182
He's 14-- he jumped out

11:55.215 --> 11:56.516
somewhere
northwest of here.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.051
You got to help me find him.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.053
(phone ringing)
Hello?

12:00.087 --> 12:01.755
Ms. Dineen,
this is Ranger Carter

12:01.789 --> 12:03.957
with Search and Rescue.
Where have you been?

12:03.991 --> 12:05.759
We have multiple
active incidents in the field.

12:05.793 --> 12:06.794
Sudden wind shears
are taking out climbers

12:06.827 --> 12:07.928
left and right.
And planes.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.997
We're at a small Cessna
five miles from the landslide.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.499
One injured, stable,
one lost teenager,

12:12.532 --> 12:14.501
and we have a doctor providing treatment.
We've got a civilian

12:14.534 --> 12:16.269
on a rock ledge 50 feet up
with no harness.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.537
We got to tend
to that one first.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.406
See if you can communicate
with your lost teen.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.408
I'll be in touch
as soon as I can.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.542
Walter, what do we do?

12:22.575 --> 12:24.177
Well, we go find his son.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.847
Toby and Happy,
stay here and tend to Jessie.

12:26.880 --> 12:27.981
Paige, we're gonna go
with Frank.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.983
He knows the general area
that Elijah jumped out of.

12:30.017 --> 12:31.551
We can calculate the rest.
HAPPY: There's no roads

12:31.584 --> 12:33.020
out there--
you guys will have to hike.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.521
Call me when she wakes up.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.857
Copy that.
Good luck.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.391
I don't get
why you're mad.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.960
It's my freedom
at stake!

12:39.993 --> 12:41.795
I have a right
to know you're trying

12:41.829 --> 12:43.831
to get the guy who screwed me.
But we didn't

12:43.864 --> 12:46.133
want to get your hopes up
that we would catch him.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.935
Now, with all the
extra computing MIPS

12:47.968 --> 12:50.203
that I've directed
at Collins' last known location,

12:50.237 --> 12:52.372
we have a shot.
Yeah, well, I'm still pissed.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.573
I missed a call
from Paige.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.275
Yeah, Paige.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.944
What's up?

12:56.977 --> 12:58.211
Okay, you got to be kidding me.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.446
All right,
I'm putting you on speaker.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.581
Sly, listen up.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.583
PAIGE: ...and Happy and Toby
are with Jessie.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.485
We're trying to locate
Frank's son.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.554
It's tough terrain,
so we're guesstimating.

13:07.587 --> 13:08.288
WALTER:
Uh, Sly,

13:08.321 --> 13:09.923
can you run some
calculations?

13:09.957 --> 13:11.324
Roger that.

13:12.960 --> 13:17.264
I am pulling up a map of
Piker State Forest as we speak.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.200
Hey, Cabe, could you get Happy
on the line? And, Frank,

13:20.233 --> 13:23.170
hit me with it. We were about
8,000 feet when Elijah leapt.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.905
Approximate coordinates?
No idea.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.473
We were in a nosedive--
I was panicking.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.541
How about when you first started
having trouble with the plane?

13:28.575 --> 13:32.345
Rough estimate, let's say we
just passed northwest of Taos,

13:32.379 --> 13:34.181
going west.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.986
Okay. And your son's
approximate weight?

13:39.019 --> 13:40.353
About 150.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.890
All right, I got Happy and
Toby linked in. Hey, guys,

13:42.923 --> 13:45.058
just doing a fast track
of your phones' GPS location

13:45.092 --> 13:46.293
so we can find Elijah.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.227
How's the girl doing?

13:47.260 --> 13:49.897
Search and Rescue's med kit
had an air cast.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.932
Toby strengthened it
with two branches.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.867
My man's pretty slick
when he needs to be.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.869
CABE: Yeah, well,
speaking of slick, Walter,

13:55.903 --> 13:57.938
I found out about the CLAM
under the ramp.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.973
Thought we had mold
under the ramp.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.341
SYLVESTER:
Okay,

14:01.374 --> 14:03.276
I pinpointed the crash site,

14:03.310 --> 14:05.012
and I've got
an approximate jump spot.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.317
Got it. Sending you
the coordinates for where Elijah

14:10.350 --> 14:12.319
should have landed--
it's about

14:12.352 --> 14:14.254
a hundred square yards,
since I couldn't predict

14:14.287 --> 14:16.957
any wind shears he might have
encountered on his descent.

14:16.990 --> 14:17.925
Eh, we're not far away.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.159
Sly, Cabe,
we'll call you

14:19.192 --> 14:21.929
if we need anything, but I think
we've got Elijah pinpointed.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.330
We're in good shape.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.465
It's just up here,
this way.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.937
TOBY:
Okay.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.972
Well, she's
starting to stir.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.640
Touch of meperidine
so she doesn't wake up

14:33.673 --> 14:34.942
in excruciating pain.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.111
(exhales)

14:38.145 --> 14:40.513
(bird squawking in distance)

14:40.547 --> 14:42.449
Oh...
Hey, hey, Jess, Jess, Jess.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.550
Jess, you're okay.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.418
You were in a
plane crash.

14:45.452 --> 14:46.954
You have a broken leg
and a concussion.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.688
I'm a doctor.
You've been treated.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.523
A medevac will hopefully
be here shortly.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.959
My dad?

14:51.992 --> 14:53.326
HAPPY: Oh, he's fine.
He's with our friends.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.995
They went to go get
your brother.

14:55.028 --> 14:58.031
My brother?

14:58.065 --> 15:01.001
Oh.

15:01.034 --> 15:01.868
Okay.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.704
Uh... does my dad
know where he is?

15:04.737 --> 15:05.939
Our colleagues think
they have it narrowed down

15:05.973 --> 15:06.974
to where he landed.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.344
I just hope he finds him.

15:11.378 --> 15:14.014
Hey, guys, just
a heads-up.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.949
We got an awake and alert
patient over here.

15:15.983 --> 15:17.184
Jessie, thank God.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.285
Listen, honey,

15:18.318 --> 15:20.087
we're getting close
to your brother.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.089
Soon as we find him,
I'll let you know, okay?

15:22.122 --> 15:22.990
Okay, Dad.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.324
(panting)

15:24.357 --> 15:25.392
We really need to find him.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.360
I promise I will.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.062
Okay, look,

15:29.096 --> 15:30.430
I just made a promise
to my girl,

15:30.463 --> 15:31.498
so are we almost there or what?

15:31.531 --> 15:33.633
We're in the zone Sylvester
indicated. So it's big.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.435
Well, then we split out. No.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.703
Then one of us could get lost,

15:36.736 --> 15:38.171
and we'd have
two people to find.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.207
Actually, I think
we have zero. Look.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.477
That's him.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.449
Elijah? Elijah, can you hear us?

15:49.482 --> 15:50.683
I can't even see him up there

15:50.717 --> 15:52.085
with the branches
and the parachute.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.753
I'm going up the chute cords.
No, no, no!

15:53.786 --> 15:56.723
No, no! You might
pull him down!

15:56.756 --> 15:57.957
(gasps)

16:03.063 --> 16:05.565
I'm no genius, but something
tells me you don't have a son.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.369
â™ª

16:16.509 --> 16:17.544
Come on.
Hurry up.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.413
Good. Leave your bag.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.485
Each of you put on a pack,

16:25.518 --> 16:28.121
and put your phones
on the ground.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.423
(sighs)

16:33.126 --> 16:36.396
Good. So, Elijah was
three bags of cash.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.697
Since we're
near Mexico,

16:37.730 --> 16:40.267
I assume that you run cash
for arms dealers

16:40.300 --> 16:41.801
or drug peddlers?

16:41.834 --> 16:44.037
What kind of monster
do you think I am?

16:44.071 --> 16:45.505
It's just drug money.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.140
I don't deal with guns.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.007
Except for this one--

16:48.041 --> 16:50.177
which I'll use
if you two try anything.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.811
This isn't personal.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.514
But if I had to carry all three
of these bags by myself,

16:54.547 --> 16:56.816
it would take forever,
and the folks that are waiting

16:56.849 --> 17:00.220
for this kind of delivery...
they get mad when you're late.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.123
Tie this around your waists

17:03.156 --> 17:05.092
so you can't run off anywhere.

17:05.125 --> 17:08.628
So you've established
your son isn't real.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.163
Is Jessie even
your kid?

17:10.197 --> 17:13.133
That she is.
Chip off the old block, too.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.234
Speaking of which...

17:15.335 --> 17:16.469
(radio static)

17:16.503 --> 17:17.804
Jessie.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.406
We found it.

17:19.439 --> 17:20.773
It?

17:20.807 --> 17:23.376
Who besides my mother
refers to their son as "it"?

17:23.410 --> 17:25.245
JESSIE:
Don't move.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.248
Okay, something tells me
we're gonna regret helping her.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.783
Turn around, slow.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.785
Hey, Jess, my pals here
are gonna help me

17:32.819 --> 17:34.654
hump the cash
back to the vehicle.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.189
Make sure
you keep those other two

17:36.223 --> 17:37.524
from causing any problems, okay?

17:37.557 --> 17:39.692
See you in a bit.
Copy that, Dad.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.395
All right, the both of you,
toss me your phones.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.274
I should've gotten
the insurance plan.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.444
(rapid beeping)

17:57.477 --> 17:59.446
I knew we'd get another hit.

17:59.479 --> 18:00.780
What does it say?

18:00.813 --> 18:02.549
Uh, just one name.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.584
Beatrice Collins, 92.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.787
She's being transferred
to Shady Pines.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.423
It's a high-end
assisted living facility,

18:10.457 --> 18:12.159
in Santa Barbara!

18:12.192 --> 18:14.161
That's got to be
Collins's grandmother.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.362
That's why he sold
those radio parts--

18:15.395 --> 18:17.730
so he could get the money
to put her in the geezer home.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.833
Looks like we're going
to Santa Barbara.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.238
(whispering):
Tied up at gunpoint--

18:25.272 --> 18:26.806
what would Cabe do
in this situation?

18:26.839 --> 18:28.808
Well, we might not have
Cabe around much longer.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.343
We need to think brains,
not brawn.

18:30.377 --> 18:31.878
You've been a real jerk
about Cabe lately--

18:31.911 --> 18:33.746
I don't like it. We
could fall off a cliff.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.815
No, we're not gonna
fall off a cliff.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.351
If Cabe gets convicted,
he'd want us to stay strong.

18:38.385 --> 18:40.687
I'm not talking about Cabe--
a literal cliff, 15 feet high.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.222
We passed it
on the way here.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.357
Now, if we jump off, our
weight pulls Frank off.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.758
We'd get hurt, too.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.727
We know it's coming,
so we brace ourselves.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.297
Besides, if he gets his
money back to our truck,

18:50.330 --> 18:52.232
he's gonna kill
us all anyway.

18:52.265 --> 18:55.435
You know,
your bedside manner sucks.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.936
JESSIE:
If it looks loose,

18:56.969 --> 18:58.671
you'll regret not doing
it right the first time.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.445
Now you. Your ankles.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.853
Hey, Jess, your dad
said that Elijah

19:13.886 --> 19:15.922
was 150 pounds.

19:15.955 --> 19:20.327
A dollar bill is .04 ounces,
and since the hundred

19:20.360 --> 19:22.529
is the preferred denomination
of arms dealers...

19:22.562 --> 19:23.930
Drug dealers.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.398
My mistake.

19:25.432 --> 19:27.367
So 10,000 hundreds

19:27.400 --> 19:28.801
is a million dollars,
so that's...

19:28.835 --> 19:30.803
25 pounds

19:30.837 --> 19:32.839
per million dollars,
so... I'm assuming

19:32.872 --> 19:35.608
there's over $6 million
being brought back here?

19:35.642 --> 19:37.477
Your wrists.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.212
And shut up.

19:45.652 --> 19:46.953
JESSIE:
Okay.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.722
You don't pull anything,
I don't shoot you.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.463
HAPPY:
You sure know a lot

19:56.496 --> 19:59.399
about denominational choices
of scumbags.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.601
Well, try paying The Gooch
with crumpled singles.

20:01.634 --> 20:05.204
Our kid has no shot--
it's going to jail.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.342
Hey, I have to stop.

20:10.477 --> 20:11.744
Hey. Get that
pack back on.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.346
Hey, I have
an old lacrosse injury,

20:13.380 --> 20:14.847
and it is killing me.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.283
If you want that
money carried,

20:16.316 --> 20:18.251
I need a break.

20:18.285 --> 20:19.519
You got a lacrosse injury, too?

20:19.552 --> 20:21.588
Uh... chess club.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.957
Two minutes.
(radio static)

20:24.991 --> 20:26.359
Hey, Jess.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.927
My caddies need a blow,

20:27.960 --> 20:29.362
so we'll be back
at it again soon.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.666
(yelling)

20:33.700 --> 20:34.601
(gasps)

20:34.634 --> 20:36.303
(yells)

20:37.470 --> 20:38.938
Why aren't we
on the ground?

20:42.475 --> 20:44.277
Oh, the cord's caught
on branches.

20:46.446 --> 20:47.447
Lying bastards!

20:48.648 --> 20:49.682
(gunshot)
(gasps)

20:49.716 --> 20:51.017
(gunshots)

20:51.050 --> 20:52.084
Hey! Hey! Hey!

20:52.118 --> 20:54.387
Stop shooting! If you hit
us, we're dead weight,

20:54.421 --> 20:55.822
and you won't be able
to lift us up!

20:55.855 --> 20:57.690
I'll take my chances.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.492
(gunshots)

21:03.796 --> 21:04.831
Rockslide!

21:13.072 --> 21:15.375
You okay?

21:15.408 --> 21:17.009
Yeah. You?

21:17.043 --> 21:18.445
Yeah.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.348
(panting)

21:21.381 --> 21:24.617
Well, the good news--
Frank can't get to us.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.486
Bad news?

21:27.520 --> 21:29.856
We can't get out.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.065
(both groan)

21:39.098 --> 21:42.369
All right, that should
give us some fresh air.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.003
Now we have
to figure out a way out.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.005
What if he's waiting for us?

21:46.038 --> 21:48.508
Oh, you heard him. He can't be
late delivering the money,

21:48.541 --> 21:50.710
so he saw us get stuck,
we're no longer a threat.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.579
He'll be lugging
those three heavy bags

21:52.612 --> 21:55.482
to the plane by himself,
content to let us die in here.

21:55.515 --> 21:56.883
There's a lovely thought.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.018
You want a worse one?
He's gonna kill Happy and Toby

21:59.051 --> 22:00.453
once he knows
that his daughter's okay

22:00.487 --> 22:01.888
and Toby's medical help
isn't needed anymore.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.923
So, those bags
will slow him down,

22:03.956 --> 22:07.093
but we need to find a solution
before he gets back to them.

22:07.126 --> 22:09.429
So, let's start thinking.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.697
Aah! Oh, what is that?

22:10.730 --> 22:12.465
I kicked something.

22:12.499 --> 22:15.034
Oh, oh. Oh, Frank's walkie.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.769
Must have dropped it
when he fell.

22:16.803 --> 22:19.372
Jessie has the other one.
She'll hear us asking for help.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.774
We need to signal Happy
and Toby without her knowing.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.710
I have an idea.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.078
(rhythmic static)

22:26.112 --> 22:27.847
Morse code?

22:27.880 --> 22:30.016
(static continues)
No. Static's too amorphous

22:30.049 --> 22:32.552
for the sharp tones
needed for Morse code.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.521
What I'm doing is even better.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.823
(rhythmic static)

22:36.856 --> 22:38.691
Ugh!

22:38.725 --> 22:40.427
Part of me thinks
you engineered all of this

22:40.460 --> 22:41.761
just to get me into zip ties.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.730
If I did,
I forgot the safe word.

22:43.763 --> 22:46.699
(static) JESSIE: Dad?

22:46.733 --> 22:49.101
Dad, the connection's bad.
You have to find higher ground.

22:49.135 --> 22:52.038
Sounds like Daddy dearest is
having trouble reaching out.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.841
Dad?! Maybe Walt tricked
the guy into getting lost,

22:54.874 --> 22:56.909
bought us some time.
Shh. (static)

22:56.943 --> 22:59.946
I don't even think
Daddy's with our pals anymore.

22:59.979 --> 23:02.715
What are you talking about?
Listen to that static.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.016
(rhythmic static)

23:04.050 --> 23:05.585
Doesn't it sound familiar?

23:05.618 --> 23:06.953
(rhythmic static)

23:06.986 --> 23:08.521
No way.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.423
BOTH:
It's a Meat Tube.

23:10.457 --> 23:12.191
â™ª Pretty sweet tube

23:12.224 --> 23:14.727
â™ª It's a jump up and get
on your feet tube... â™ª

23:14.761 --> 23:15.962
JESSIE:
Dad?

23:15.995 --> 23:17.464
Hello?

23:17.497 --> 23:19.632
We got to get Jess's walkie.

23:19.666 --> 23:23.069
I may have a way...
but it's a little crimey.

23:25.605 --> 23:26.673
Come on! Come on!

23:26.706 --> 23:28.708
Come on!

23:29.709 --> 23:31.711
Hello!

23:34.881 --> 23:36.082
(sighs)

23:36.115 --> 23:37.083
SYLVESTER:
We're looking

23:37.116 --> 23:39.552
for a resident here.
A man's freedom is at stake.

23:39.586 --> 23:41.988
Welcome to Shady Pines.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.723
Oh, man.
I'm sorry.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.592
Could you say that again, honey?
Hello!

23:45.625 --> 23:47.093
Hello!
I am an attorney,

23:47.126 --> 23:51.464
and I am looking for someone
named Beatrice Collins.

23:51.498 --> 23:53.566
A very bad criminal is going
to meet with her soon.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.601
She's moving in today.

23:54.634 --> 23:57.637
Is she a lady friend, or...

23:59.205 --> 24:00.840
...are you unattached?

24:00.873 --> 24:01.941
Aye.

24:01.974 --> 24:03.209
Yes, he's unattached...
Ooh.

24:03.242 --> 24:07.079
...and you two can talk about
it over tea after you tell us

24:07.113 --> 24:08.247
where Beatrice is.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.582
Beatrice. Just a minute.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.685
Take one for the team,
Counselor.

24:12.719 --> 24:15.488
Sorry. There is nobody
by that name moving in today.

24:15.522 --> 24:17.790
Are you certain?
Absolutely.

24:17.824 --> 24:20.627
My eyes are in perfect shape.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.829
Just like the rest of me.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.130
Super.

24:24.163 --> 24:25.632
What the hell's going on?

24:25.665 --> 24:27.133
The CLAM said she'll be here.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.101
Could be data overload,
it could be a glitch.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.703
(phone chimes)
Oh.

24:30.737 --> 24:33.172
But it's not
glitching now. Look.

24:33.205 --> 24:35.675
We got a facial recognition
match in Santa Barbara.

24:35.708 --> 24:36.709
He is here.

24:36.743 --> 24:38.711
Let's move.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.648
(laughs)

24:41.681 --> 24:44.651
Well, the trick is to
untie your shoelaces

24:44.684 --> 24:46.819
and then loop them through your zip ties.
If you can

24:46.853 --> 24:48.788
untie my laces,
untie the damn rope.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.289
Did you not hear
the gun lady threaten

24:50.322 --> 24:51.591
to shoot me if I cut corners

24:51.624 --> 24:53.192
on my tie job?

24:53.225 --> 24:54.894
I can't get 'em
with my wrists zipped,

24:54.927 --> 24:57.564
but your shoelaces,
on the other hand.

24:57.597 --> 24:58.765
VoilÃ .

25:02.602 --> 25:05.204
Okay. Now we make
friction your friend.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.574
Do I even want to know
how you know how to do this?

25:07.607 --> 25:10.142
You'll be shocked to learn
it involves The Gooch.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.510
And the trunk of his car.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.247
Oh.

25:15.281 --> 25:18.250
Is this what we have to
look forward to with our kids?

25:18.284 --> 25:19.719
Pulling them out of trouble

25:19.752 --> 25:21.988
when they are caught
by Paulie Six-Fingers?

25:22.021 --> 25:23.823
It was actually
Donnie Four-Fingers.

25:23.856 --> 25:26.759
You want to know how
he wound up with four fingers?

25:26.793 --> 25:28.761
No. Now get in the cockpit.

25:31.698 --> 25:32.231
What's that for?

25:32.264 --> 25:33.633
Our captor.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.702
Who's approaching
the plane's aileron.

25:35.735 --> 25:38.605
On my call,
you run out and grab her gun.

25:38.638 --> 25:39.706
JESSIE:
Dad,

25:39.739 --> 25:41.240
this damn thing's not working.
Ready?

25:42.008 --> 25:43.610
Go!

25:43.643 --> 25:45.912
(grunts)

25:45.945 --> 25:48.047
(Toby groans, gasps)

25:48.080 --> 25:49.749
Not so fast!

25:49.782 --> 25:52.885
Okay, tie her to
the landing gear.

26:00.292 --> 26:02.962
(zip tie tightening)

26:02.995 --> 26:04.997
Won't want her
hearing our plan.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.236
Okay, Walt, Paige,
what's going on?

26:10.269 --> 26:12.371
Happy! Thank God.
We're buried in a cave.

26:12.404 --> 26:13.372
Frank's returning
to the truck.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.741
Not good. WALTER: We need

26:14.774 --> 26:15.642
your winch to remove the rocks.

26:15.675 --> 26:17.243
Well, we can't get to you
without possibly

26:17.276 --> 26:18.745
crossing Frank
on his way back here.

26:18.778 --> 26:19.712
PAIGE:
Then find a way

26:19.746 --> 26:20.947
he definitely won't be going.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.314
He can't climb
with all the bags he's carrying.

26:22.348 --> 26:24.784
Uh, there's a Search
and Rescue map in the truck.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.653
WALTER: Great. Now,
remember Sly's calculations

26:26.686 --> 26:27.887
for fake-Elijah's
parachute jump?

26:27.920 --> 26:31.357
We leapt off the cliff about
four miles southeast of there.

26:31.390 --> 26:32.792
Uh, 15 feet high.

26:32.825 --> 26:33.860
Okay, I found it.

26:33.893 --> 26:36.128
Uh, there is a 90-foot cliff

26:36.162 --> 26:37.363
not far from here.

26:37.396 --> 26:38.765
There's rope
in the truck.

26:38.798 --> 26:39.732
Toby could rappel down.

26:39.766 --> 26:40.867
I could?

26:40.900 --> 26:42.201
And be a few miles
shy of you.

26:42.234 --> 26:44.136
He'll carry the winch on his back.
I will?

26:44.170 --> 26:45.371
Yeah, you baby.

26:45.404 --> 26:46.806
And once you are gone,

26:46.839 --> 26:48.407
I will pull the spark
plugs from the truck,

26:48.440 --> 26:50.910
and booby-trap the door, so
once they're both closed,

26:50.943 --> 26:52.879
Daddy and his little
girl can't get out.

26:52.912 --> 26:54.080
Frank can shoot his way out.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.147
It's a rescue vehicle designed

26:55.181 --> 26:56.215
for mountain conditions.

26:56.248 --> 26:57.349
The windows
are reinforced

26:57.383 --> 26:59.185
to withstand rockfalls.
It's essentially bulletproof.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.352
TOBY:
All right, guys.

27:00.386 --> 27:02.188
Hold tight. I'll, uh...
I'll see you soon.

27:02.221 --> 27:03.890
PAIGE:
Okay. Hurry.

27:03.923 --> 27:07.393
You know, scary as it sounds,
our fate is in Toby's hands.

27:07.426 --> 27:09.962
Still better
than being in Cabe's shoes.

27:09.996 --> 27:12.331
Walter, do you have any idea
how cold that sounds?

27:12.364 --> 27:13.933
Well, it's a fact.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.168
I'd rather be here
with a chance of rescue

27:16.202 --> 27:17.937
than be facing years in prison

27:17.970 --> 27:20.072
with a novice attorney
as my only hope.

27:20.106 --> 27:21.741
(sighs)

27:21.774 --> 27:24.076
The "say it to your cellmate"
comment this morning,

27:24.110 --> 27:26.746
intentionally
not buying him bananas.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.681
I had no idea
he wanted bananas.

27:28.715 --> 27:31.083
Do you realize
what you're doing?

27:31.117 --> 27:32.852
You're subconsciously distancing
yourself from Cabe

27:32.885 --> 27:35.087
so if he goes to prison,
it'll hurt less.

27:35.121 --> 27:38.190
But you are only ruining
your last moments with him.

27:38.224 --> 27:41.227
Didn't you ever have a friend
move away when you were a kid

27:41.260 --> 27:42.762
and have to say good-bye?

27:42.795 --> 27:44.997
I didn't have friends...

27:45.031 --> 27:48.400
before Scorpion, so...

27:48.434 --> 27:51.938
didn't really have a...
a friend to lose.

27:54.373 --> 27:57.009
I don't know what I'd do
if Cabe gets taken away.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.680
Don't know how
to process it.

28:05.217 --> 28:08.254
When my mom left my dad...

28:10.089 --> 28:13.760
...he said to me, "The worst
thing you can do to yourself

28:13.793 --> 28:16.963
is care about someone more
than you care about yourself."

28:20.399 --> 28:21.768
He meant

28:21.801 --> 28:24.737
pain is the price
you pay for love.

28:26.906 --> 28:29.942
You are trying
to avoid paying the price.

28:29.976 --> 28:33.980
Tell me what to do.
I don't... I don't know.

28:34.013 --> 28:36.916
Don't push him away.

28:36.949 --> 28:39.852
'Cause if the worst happens...

28:41.487 --> 28:44.156
...you'll never
forgive yourself.

28:46.993 --> 28:48.761
You sure you had
the address right?

28:48.795 --> 28:51.263
I have a very high IQ.
I know how to read an address.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.032
(phone rings)

28:53.065 --> 28:55.935
Oh, man,
it's your prosecutor.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.203
Hello. This is Sylvester Dodd.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.404
WOMAN:
This is Assistant

28:58.437 --> 29:01.440
U.S. Attorney Hadley Dine,
assigned to Mr. Gallo's case,

29:01.473 --> 29:03.943
notifying you
that we'll be subpoenaing

29:03.976 --> 29:05.912
all of his financial records.

29:05.945 --> 29:07.346
We received an anonymous tip

29:07.379 --> 29:09.015
from an account
in your client's name

29:09.048 --> 29:12.084
with a recent deposit
of $50,000.

29:12.118 --> 29:13.252
No way! I'm broke!

29:13.285 --> 29:14.854
What does this have
to do with Mark Collins?

29:14.887 --> 29:15.988
The deposit was traced

29:16.022 --> 29:18.925
to an offshore account
in Collins's name at Tuza Banco.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.092
Mr. Collins sent

29:20.126 --> 29:21.928
your client the money.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.362
I'll call you back.

29:23.395 --> 29:24.831
That's bull.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.299
I never took any
money from Collins.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.836
I've never set foot
near a Tuza Banco.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.871
Cabe.

29:34.273 --> 29:37.776
That son of a bitch
is toying with us.

29:42.982 --> 29:46.418
(Jessie grunting)

29:46.452 --> 29:48.955
(inhales sharply)
Ow!

29:50.622 --> 29:52.291
(gasps)

29:52.324 --> 29:55.027
(groans) Hey, what's
your problem?

29:55.061 --> 29:56.929
The air cast is deflating.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.364
Hurts like hell.
Well, you've made

29:58.397 --> 30:00.499
some poor life choices. Sorry.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.003
(gasps)

30:05.371 --> 30:07.239
(sighs)

30:11.277 --> 30:13.946
I'll pump your cast,
but I want some answers.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.948
Fine. Just help me.

30:18.985 --> 30:21.520
(wincing through teeth)

30:21.553 --> 30:24.223
So, when did you decide
to join the family business

30:24.256 --> 30:26.358
of being a dirtbag criminal?

30:26.392 --> 30:27.894
Screw you.
Okay.

30:27.927 --> 30:30.062
Cast go bye-bye. No, no, no.
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

30:30.096 --> 30:32.031
(sighs)
I don't know.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.366
I-I just always
followed my dad around.

30:34.400 --> 30:37.569
It was just me and him.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.471
What he did, I did.
But...

30:39.505 --> 30:41.007
when you were a kid,

30:41.040 --> 30:43.442
were you stealing Barbies
and stuff?

30:43.475 --> 30:45.044
What are you getting at?

30:45.077 --> 30:47.914
Was it your call, or
did he drag you into this mess?

30:49.348 --> 30:51.850
You know what? Forget it.
I don't care.

30:53.652 --> 30:57.990
I mean, your dad's
your dad, you know?

30:58.024 --> 31:00.893
(air pumping)

31:00.927 --> 31:02.929
(sighs)

31:04.931 --> 31:06.365
When we get back,
you and Walter

31:06.398 --> 31:07.633
are gonna get into
that CLAM thing.

31:07.666 --> 31:10.302
And you're gonna figure out
how Collins cracked it. Cabe.

31:10.336 --> 31:12.304
And then you're gonna
figure out how to track him.

31:12.338 --> 31:14.006
And then we're gonna find him.
Cabe.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.442
And I'm gonna beat him to
within an inch of his life

31:16.475 --> 31:18.244
until he confesses.
Cabe.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.312
He beat us, okay?

31:20.346 --> 31:22.481
He totally manipulated us.

31:22.514 --> 31:25.952
You need to stop with these
unrealistic fantasies.

31:25.985 --> 31:30.022
You taking the stand, you
beating Collins to confession.

31:31.190 --> 31:33.525
You need to get real.

31:33.559 --> 31:36.562
This is going
to be a tough trial.

31:36.595 --> 31:39.431
And the only way out
is through.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.170
You need to get that
in your head.

31:52.378 --> 31:54.580
(engine starts)

31:54.613 --> 31:55.614
Walter?

31:55.647 --> 31:57.716
Paige?
Toby! Toby, in here!

31:57.749 --> 32:00.019
Where have you been?!

32:00.052 --> 32:02.288
Oh, I'm so sorry. Did I not
scale down a 90-foot cliff

32:02.321 --> 32:03.622
and run here
with a piece of machinery

32:03.655 --> 32:05.157
strapped to my back
fast enough for you?

32:05.191 --> 32:06.325
Point taken.

32:06.358 --> 32:07.960
I'm gonna feed
the strap to you now.

32:07.994 --> 32:09.962
Wrap it around
and then send it back to me.

32:09.996 --> 32:12.999
Got it. Okay.

32:13.032 --> 32:15.301
Strap coming through!

32:15.334 --> 32:18.137
(groaning)

32:18.170 --> 32:20.172
(Walter groans)

32:27.013 --> 32:28.047
TOBY:
All right!

32:28.080 --> 32:29.115
Stand back!

32:29.148 --> 32:30.382
Okay.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.518
(groaning) TOBY: Three.

32:32.551 --> 32:36.355
Two. One. Go!

32:37.723 --> 32:39.191
All right, all right.

32:39.225 --> 32:41.693
Little performance anxiety.
Happens to everyone.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.029
What's going on?

32:43.062 --> 32:45.631
Uh...

32:45.664 --> 32:48.100
sleeve column's broken.
PAIGE: What?

32:48.134 --> 32:49.768
Happy's inventions
never break.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.270
They do when
her husband accidentally

32:51.303 --> 32:52.704
drops it off a 90-foot cliff.

32:52.738 --> 32:53.772
My bad.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.107
I can replace it, I-I just need

32:55.141 --> 32:56.442
something smooth
and canal-shaped.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.210
Just like a Walter O'Brien
Center Cut Meat Tube.

32:58.244 --> 32:59.645
Yeah, Walt,

32:59.678 --> 33:01.480
that's a great idea.
I'll just run to the nearest

33:01.513 --> 33:02.781
imaginary supermarket

33:02.814 --> 33:05.017
and buy one of your stupid
imaginary hot dogs.

33:05.051 --> 33:07.219
No, this area's
full of cypress trees.

33:07.253 --> 33:09.988
Take a young branch and then
carve out a trench with a stone.

33:19.765 --> 33:21.767
It's gonna need
a friction barrier,

33:21.800 --> 33:24.170
otherwise the cable
won't pull smoothly.

33:24.203 --> 33:25.804
I'm adding sap!

33:25.837 --> 33:27.739
Uh...

33:27.773 --> 33:29.775
Just like fixings
in my Meat Tube.

33:32.311 --> 33:34.012
You don't know how that sounds.

33:38.550 --> 33:39.718
Okay.

33:45.157 --> 33:46.058
Here it goes!

33:48.694 --> 33:51.230
(winch whirring)

34:01.573 --> 34:03.742
(both coughing)

34:03.775 --> 34:06.178
I never thought
we'd get out.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.084
Further up here, to the left.

34:12.118 --> 34:14.220
Happy, they're out.
How goes you?

34:15.754 --> 34:17.556
Well, not so good.

34:19.825 --> 34:21.059
(whispers):
Daddy's home.

34:26.398 --> 34:30.569
Come on, Toby, you can make it!
My arms are so tired.

34:30.602 --> 34:33.605
You got to hurry! Frank won't
expect us to climb this wall.

34:33.639 --> 34:34.806
'Cause it's insane!

34:34.840 --> 34:36.542
WALTER: We got to get
the jump on him.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.410
Come on, Toby.
Happy's life is on the line!

34:38.444 --> 34:40.346
Hand over hand, just like
the rope in gym class.

34:40.379 --> 34:41.880
I always...

34:41.913 --> 34:43.849
hated... that rope,

34:43.882 --> 34:46.785
'cause it gave...
friction burns

34:46.818 --> 34:48.687
to my gooty!

34:48.720 --> 34:51.723
Okay, I just untied
your daughter,

34:51.757 --> 34:53.325
I loaded up all your gear

34:53.359 --> 34:56.195
from the plane, and secured
all your bags of cash.

34:56.228 --> 34:57.896
How about you,
uh, let me go?

34:57.929 --> 34:59.365
Nice try.

34:59.398 --> 35:00.832
Now help my daughter
in the truck.

35:00.866 --> 35:03.335
Okay, if you
say so.

35:12.878 --> 35:14.213
Uh, you getting in or what?

35:14.246 --> 35:15.381
My leg's killing me.

35:15.414 --> 35:16.748
I'll get in
when it's time to go.

35:16.782 --> 35:19.185
You leg's killing you
because hanging it

35:19.218 --> 35:22.254
causes blood to rush,
which causes throbbing.

35:22.288 --> 35:23.789
At least rest it
in the footwell.

35:29.428 --> 35:31.463
You know, for someone
who's made poor life decisions,

35:31.497 --> 35:33.165
I'm still getting away.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.235
If you say so.

35:38.237 --> 35:40.339
Okay, one door down.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.641
Just need that
driver's door closed

35:42.674 --> 35:43.842
and they're trapped.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.244
(glove compartment opens)

35:45.277 --> 35:47.346
Dad, there's no maps.

35:47.379 --> 35:49.248
Now step away from the truck.

35:50.716 --> 35:54.220
(knocks on glass)
Dad, did you hear me?

35:54.253 --> 35:55.921
Dad! She messed
with the truck!

35:59.325 --> 36:00.892
Hey!

36:01.793 --> 36:03.429
Get over here.

36:04.563 --> 36:06.932
What did you do?

36:06.965 --> 36:08.800
I'll kill you.
Okay, listen,

36:08.834 --> 36:11.803
your daughter is trapped
in a truck with no way out

36:11.837 --> 36:13.239
and you are 100
miles away from

36:13.272 --> 36:14.906
the people who are
waiting for that money.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.209
Happy's stalling.
You gonna leave her here

36:17.243 --> 36:18.844
and hope that the state rangers don't
find her? She wants us to do something.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.646
You gonna try to get her out...?
Okay, whatever it is,

36:20.679 --> 36:21.647
let's do it fast.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.215
There's no good options.

36:23.249 --> 36:25.284
Fix this damn truck.

36:25.317 --> 36:27.819
That guy's gonna snap-- all he
cares about is the damn money.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.223
PAIGE:
That's not the only thing

36:31.257 --> 36:31.923
he cares about.

36:33.392 --> 36:34.726
Toby.

36:35.461 --> 36:36.562
Go find a sharp stone,

36:36.595 --> 36:37.829
cut the brakes.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.266
HAPPY: Look, I don't
care about your money.

36:40.299 --> 36:41.900
I don't care who
you deliver it to.

36:41.933 --> 36:43.735
So why don't you throw
that gun into the woods

36:43.769 --> 36:46.238
and I give you my word,
I will fix your truck.

36:46.272 --> 36:48.474
Okay? And then you and Jess
can get out of here.

36:48.507 --> 36:50.376
You think I'm stupid?

36:50.409 --> 36:52.544
Open the door!

36:52.578 --> 36:54.212
(groans)

36:56.982 --> 36:59.985
Okay, fine.
Take it easy.

37:00.018 --> 37:02.788
I have a release cord
running to the truck bed.

37:02.821 --> 37:03.989
I will undo it.

37:04.022 --> 37:06.224
Just... be cool.

37:11.997 --> 37:13.365
Now!

37:14.700 --> 37:16.668
Dad! The cliff!

37:16.702 --> 37:18.670
Dad! I can't get out!
Jessie!

37:18.704 --> 37:20.306
Jessie!
Stop it!

37:20.339 --> 37:21.740
Jessie, baby, hold on, baby!

37:21.773 --> 37:23.309
Dad, get me out of here!

37:23.342 --> 37:24.343
Jessie, I got...

37:24.376 --> 37:26.312
Jessie! Jessie, hold on!

37:26.345 --> 37:27.679
Hit the brake!

37:28.647 --> 37:29.881
The brake's not working!

37:29.915 --> 37:31.350
Help us!
JESSIE: What do I do?!

37:32.718 --> 37:35.321
Dad! There's a cliff coming!
Get out of the way!

37:35.354 --> 37:36.322
Oh, God. I'm not leaving you!
Move!

37:38.023 --> 37:39.825
Move, get out of the way!
(grunting)

37:40.726 --> 37:42.661
Oh, God.

37:42.694 --> 37:43.929
(screams)

37:57.709 --> 37:59.077
That held up well, considering
I didn't secure it.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.779
We bluffed you, Frank.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.383
On an actual bluff,
which makes it cooler.

38:09.087 --> 38:10.756
Okay, you know the drill.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.458
I'm gonna put some
leftovers in a pot,

38:12.491 --> 38:14.660
and in about 15 minutes,
you'll start complaining.

38:14.693 --> 38:15.927
Mm-hmm, thanks.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.963
Yeah, thanks, Paige.

38:20.399 --> 38:22.033
Hey.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.301
What's up, grabby?

38:23.335 --> 38:26.605
Okay, we literally watched a kid
almost fall into the abyss today

38:26.638 --> 38:28.740
'cause she followed
her dad's footsteps.

38:28.774 --> 38:29.775
And?

38:29.808 --> 38:32.444
And we have gangster blood.
You said so yourself.

38:32.478 --> 38:35.481
We can't make a hoagie
with spoiled meat.

38:35.514 --> 38:37.115
My meat's not spoiled.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.851
Genetics are real, doctor.

38:39.885 --> 38:42.788
Sweetheart, it's
nature vs. nurture.

38:42.821 --> 38:45.957
Jess was nurtured
by a sociopath.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.093
Our children will be
nurtured by you and me.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.395
And what if we suck?

38:49.428 --> 38:50.829
We're gonna be great.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.900
I mean, all parents
do suck, sometimes.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.702
But when we do, we
got Super-Mom Paige

38:56.735 --> 38:57.869
to watch out for us.

38:57.903 --> 38:59.671
And Walter's
already reading up

38:59.705 --> 39:01.840
on early-stage
neurological development.

39:01.873 --> 39:04.710
Sly's gonna give that kid
a daily sanitizer dip.

39:04.743 --> 39:08.046
And Cabe will put
his foot up our ass

39:08.079 --> 39:10.015
if we so much as
miss a violin recital.

39:10.048 --> 39:13.018
If anything, we got to worry
about them screwing up our kid.

39:13.051 --> 39:14.486
We're gonna be fine.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.021
Okay?

39:17.656 --> 39:19.357
Okay.

39:30.569 --> 39:33.439
Hey. How you guys holding up?
SYLVESTER: All right.

39:33.472 --> 39:35.441
Sorry we weren't there for you
when you needed us.

39:35.474 --> 39:37.409
Yeah, you guys could've
been hurt while we were out

39:37.443 --> 39:39.545
on our wild-goose chase.

39:39.578 --> 39:42.147
This damn trial's
got everything screwed up.

39:44.149 --> 39:45.917
I need him focused,

39:45.951 --> 39:47.719
but Collins has him shaken.

39:47.753 --> 39:50.188
Well, he's back home
in the garage, where he's safe.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.557
CABE:
Son of a bitch.

39:59.965 --> 40:01.433
I found this.

40:01.467 --> 40:03.435
It's from Collins, I just know.

40:03.469 --> 40:04.903
I-Is it safe?

40:04.936 --> 40:06.538
Do we need to call
the bomb squad?

40:06.572 --> 40:08.540
No, that's too blunt.
Not Mark's style.

40:13.779 --> 40:15.981
"So you look sharp in court.

40:16.014 --> 40:20.051
"May the winds of justice
forever be at your back.

40:20.085 --> 40:22.454
"P.S.

40:22.488 --> 40:24.055
You should've gotten
a better lawyer."

40:28.960 --> 40:31.463
Son of a bitch was in our home!

40:31.497 --> 40:33.899
Okay, Cabe,
let's just try to relax.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.767
He set me up
for letting him escape.

40:35.801 --> 40:38.103
He framed me for a bribe
I didn't take.

40:38.136 --> 40:40.205
I've dedicated my life
to this country!

40:40.238 --> 40:42.841
I've never taken a
dime I didn't earn.

40:42.874 --> 40:44.175
For honor, duty.

40:44.209 --> 40:45.310
'Cause it's what's right!

40:45.343 --> 40:49.147
Collins can take my family,
my freedom, he can take

40:49.180 --> 40:51.216
my friends,
he can take everything!

40:51.249 --> 40:54.786
But I refuse
to let him take my name!

40:54.820 --> 40:56.488
My father's name.

40:56.522 --> 40:58.524
It won't happen.

41:01.560 --> 41:04.029
Cabe...

41:04.062 --> 41:06.264
what you just said was raw.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.535
Unfiltered.
Emotional.

41:09.568 --> 41:12.137
And completely believable.

41:12.170 --> 41:14.272
Because it wasn't fantasy.

41:14.305 --> 41:15.807
It was real.

41:15.841 --> 41:19.511
You spoke honestly
and from the heart.

41:19.545 --> 41:21.012
Your feelings are authentic,

41:21.046 --> 41:23.549
and that's what the judge
needs to hear,

41:23.582 --> 41:26.117
one on one, without a jury.

41:26.151 --> 41:29.020
I'll ask for
a bench trial

41:29.054 --> 41:32.691
so you can just speak directly
to a learned jurist.

41:32.724 --> 41:34.192
Just Cabe Gallo

41:34.225 --> 41:35.961
being Cabe Gallo.

41:35.994 --> 41:39.130
Nothing more convincing
in the world.

41:39.164 --> 41:42.133
You're saying
I can tell my side?

41:42.167 --> 41:43.669
Yes.

41:43.702 --> 41:45.236
I want you to testify.

41:45.270 --> 41:47.606
Well, all right, then.

41:47.639 --> 41:49.507
Well, let's get to work.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.545
(indistinct chatter)

41:55.581 --> 41:57.983
TOBY:
We got proof...

42:02.220 --> 42:04.522
Picked these up from Kovelsky's
on the way back.

42:07.158 --> 42:09.527
Thank you, Walter.

42:13.599 --> 42:15.767
Whatever you need, Cabe.

42:17.002 --> 42:19.137
I'm not going anywhere.

42:19.170 --> 42:21.306
Thank you, son.

42:23.609 --> 42:25.611
Thanks to all of you.
