WEBVTT

00:51.426 --> 00:59.494
Chet-chet!

00:59.518 --> 01:10.602
Chet-chet-chet!

02:48.544 --> 02:50.230
Calm, calm.

02:50.254 --> 02:53.274
-Paris.
-I'm here. The God Flame is rising.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.902
A birth blessed by morning.

02:55.926 --> 02:59.781
I feel water. Come.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.826
Where have you been?

03:02.850 --> 03:05.912
I was delayed.

03:05.936 --> 03:16.089
My water broke.

03:16.113 --> 03:21.177
Now I will sing your baby into the world.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.681
Find the way, child
Way, child, way, child

03:24.705 --> 03:28.101
Find the way, child
Way to me

03:28.125 --> 03:31.312
Prayer of the mother hand
Prayer of the father hand

03:31.336 --> 03:34.649
Find the way, child
Way to me

03:34.673 --> 03:35.733
Rise up

03:35.757 --> 03:38.153
The head is coming first.

03:38.177 --> 03:40.738
That's good news.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.908
Rise up, child
Rising up

03:43.932 --> 03:50.665
Maghra, I feel a little ear.
It's like a slippery bud.

03:50.689 --> 03:54.711
-Okay, okay. Yeah.
-Strong now.

03:54.735 --> 04:00.258
-Just get it out. Mother of--
-Yeah. Yeah.

04:00.282 --> 04:01.843
Where's Baba Voss?

04:01.867 --> 04:03.970
Baba Voss is busy.

04:03.994 --> 04:08.099
Come. Sip. Sip.

04:08.123 --> 04:10.602
We don't need the big lug.

04:10.626 --> 04:13.563
This is women's work.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.190
I want my husband
to be the first to feel the baby.

04:16.214 --> 04:20.195
He'll be here soon enough.

04:20.219 --> 04:21.904
What's that sound?

04:21.928 --> 04:26.951
Soon you will have a little one,
a little life in your arms. Think of that.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.537
Paris, I can hear killing ropes.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.080
Why have they brought out
the killing ropes?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.540
Is the village under attack?

04:32.564 --> 04:37.003
Our Scentiers reported a raiding party
coming down the valley.

04:37.027 --> 04:41.925
Men with horses and dogs.
They're at the foot of the mountain.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.635
Where is my husband?

04:43.659 --> 04:57.287
Baba? Baba Voss is commanding the defense.

04:59.758 --> 05:13.262
Take up arms! Follow me!

05:21.572 --> 05:23.633
-Chet!
-Chet!

05:23.657 --> 05:25.176
-Chet!
-Chet!

05:25.200 --> 05:36.201
-Chet!
-Chet!

05:55.439 --> 06:06.440
To the wall.

06:40.859 --> 06:45.840
Scentiers, dream the wind.

06:45.864 --> 06:51.721
Dogs, horses and men.
Cutting up mud and reeds.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.097
They're crossing the river.

06:53.121 --> 06:59.062
They burn beechwood smoke
of Queen Kane's Witchfinders.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.898
Maybe they're just following the river
to another valley.

07:01.922 --> 07:06.402
Matal, presage. What is their intention?

07:06.426 --> 07:12.408
I feel savage intent in the air.
Savage and soon.

07:12.432 --> 07:18.081
Ayuras, how many?

07:18.105 --> 07:21.793
Horses by the dozens
and many men marching.

07:21.817 --> 07:23.711
Two hundred, maybe more.

07:23.735 --> 07:33.638
This isn't a raiding party.
It's a whole army.

07:33.662 --> 07:37.976
Alkenny. This is our home.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.522
We are one and we fight as one.

07:42.546 --> 07:53.797
Prepare for battle.

08:20.584 --> 08:27.150
I, Baba Voss, vow to defend against...
the Great Flame of the Alkenny!

08:27.174 --> 08:28.276
Glorious Flame!

08:28.300 --> 08:30.195
Back to Queen Kane
in the belly of their dogs.

08:30.219 --> 08:34.157
Follow, brothers, into battle...

08:34.181 --> 08:38.745
Follow me!

08:38.769 --> 08:40.205
Up. Up we go.

08:40.229 --> 08:46.336
-God.
-Up. Come.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.255
Who is attacking us?

08:49.279 --> 08:53.801
It's probably just some nomads,
hunting for slaves. Yeah?

08:53.825 --> 08:57.096
Paris...

08:57.120 --> 08:59.682
If you're lying, I will hear it.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.101
Nothing escapes my ears.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.646
I can hear doors closing in your voice.

09:04.670 --> 09:07.273
Your job right now is to breathe.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.651
Breathe and push.

09:09.675 --> 09:13.488
I can hear secrets.
What are you not telling me?

09:13.512 --> 09:15.323
How would I know anything?
I'm an old woman.

09:15.347 --> 09:21.412
Yeah, who talks to birds
and hears the future in her sleep.

09:21.436 --> 09:24.999
For three nights,
an owl has been calling out in the night.

09:25.023 --> 09:29.671
Saying what?

09:29.695 --> 09:33.675
Saying, "The Witchfinders are coming."

09:33.699 --> 09:37.262
Witchfinders? Why would they come here?

09:37.286 --> 09:50.789
Something tells me they come for you.

10:19.328 --> 10:22.390
I said untie this fucking rope.

10:22.414 --> 10:27.520
Hey! I said untie this fucking rope
right now!

10:27.544 --> 10:29.063
Untie this fucking rope!

10:29.087 --> 10:34.486
A boy in need of education.

10:34.510 --> 10:37.322
Who's there?

10:37.346 --> 10:40.408
I said who's there?

10:40.432 --> 10:45.121
Hey!

10:45.145 --> 10:49.042
Who is it?

10:49.066 --> 10:50.919
Who's there?

10:50.943 --> 11:03.598
I said untie this fucking rope right now!

11:03.622 --> 11:09.562
I am Tamacti Jun, the Witchfinder general.

11:09.586 --> 11:17.362
In my presence, it is customary to kneel.

11:17.386 --> 11:20.198
Forgive me, sir, but I'm Gether Bax.

11:20.222 --> 11:24.410
It is me who sent you the message
to come here.

11:24.434 --> 11:29.290
Then it is I who should apologize.

11:29.314 --> 11:38.716
A boy who would betray his own tribe
to do God's work.

11:38.740 --> 11:42.011
That I am, indeed.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.471
Your message says
that you have information

11:43.495 --> 11:45.807
regarding the man
we've been searching for.

11:45.831 --> 11:50.937
A heretic who Queen Kane herself
has condemned to death.

11:50.961 --> 11:55.483
A devil who murdered
the queen's own sister.

11:55.507 --> 12:03.700
Just tell me what you know about him.

12:03.724 --> 12:06.119
I know from your heralds

12:06.143 --> 12:10.915
that there is a reward
for information leading to his capture.

12:10.939 --> 12:17.422
Your reward will be your next breath
if I find your information useful.

12:17.446 --> 12:21.718
To speak, I need my throat.

12:21.742 --> 12:25.805
My Ayuras will hear any lie
like a foot through ice.

12:25.829 --> 12:30.310
I promise, sir. No ice will I break.

12:30.334 --> 12:40.445
Speak.

12:40.469 --> 12:46.409
At the end of winter,
a woman wandered into our village.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.995
-A stranger to us.
-Easy.

12:49.019 --> 12:55.835
She was found among our berry bushes.

12:55.859 --> 13:02.759
She said she got lost in a blizzard.

13:02.783 --> 13:08.056
She asked to be taken in
because she was three months pregnant.

13:08.080 --> 13:11.476
The head of our village
said he would take care of her.

13:11.500 --> 13:16.815
He has not been able to have children
of his own, so he married her.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.608
She has been with him ever since.

13:18.632 --> 13:24.405
Tell me something that I can use.
And quickly.

13:24.429 --> 13:27.784
She never said
who the father of her baby was.

13:27.808 --> 13:31.538
But when she came to the village...

13:31.562 --> 13:35.291
she was wearing this necklace.

13:35.315 --> 13:40.296
It's a love token.
It has a name written in it.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.758
Read.

13:43.782 --> 13:49.681
Jer, la, ma, rel.

13:49.705 --> 13:53.977
Jerlamarel.

13:54.001 --> 14:00.483
That is the name of the heretic
that you've been seeking, yes?

14:00.507 --> 14:04.821
Well, even now,
in the village on the mountain,

14:04.845 --> 14:08.867
a woman is giving birth
to that devil's child.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.035
If you charge up to the village now,

14:11.059 --> 14:14.205
the woman and Jerlamarel's child
can be yours.

14:14.229 --> 14:16.916
Gether Bax...

14:16.940 --> 14:20.378
tell me how your village is defended.

14:20.402 --> 14:24.340
If I find a woman
giving birth to the devil,

14:24.364 --> 14:26.718
I may let you live.

14:26.742 --> 14:35.143
If not, you will burn too.

14:35.167 --> 14:37.187
A boy or a girl?

14:37.211 --> 14:40.940
It's a boy. A boy.

14:40.964 --> 14:44.861
Ten toes. Ten fingers.

14:44.885 --> 14:48.114
Two strong lungs.

14:48.138 --> 15:00.460
Sinjay. Sinjay. Mama.

15:00.484 --> 15:03.796
Hello. Hi.

15:03.820 --> 15:09.511
Hello, baby.

15:09.535 --> 15:12.388
Yeah. Hello.

15:12.412 --> 15:18.061
Good girl, Maghra.

15:18.085 --> 15:24.734
Good girl.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.861
A little foot!

15:26.885 --> 15:28.738
-A foot?
-There's two.

15:28.762 --> 15:31.741
The second one's the wrong way.
Sinjay, sharp knife.

15:31.765 --> 15:35.203
-Maghra, I must bring him out quickly.
-All right.

15:35.227 --> 15:38.414
Breathe in. Breathe out.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.875
Breathe in. Breathe out.

15:40.899 --> 15:52.609
Breathe in. Now!

19:06.939 --> 19:19.066
-Chet-chet!
-Chet-chet-chet!

20:06.164 --> 20:18.000
-Chet-chet!
-Chet-chet-chet!

20:41.658 --> 20:53.035
Baba!

20:55.672 --> 21:06.673
Ilun!

21:07.100 --> 21:09.204
Clear the wall!

21:09.228 --> 21:11.456
Clear the wall!

21:11.480 --> 21:13.249
-Clear the wall!
-Clear the wall!

21:13.273 --> 21:18.713
Clear the wall!

21:18.737 --> 21:29.780
Clear the wall!

21:46.306 --> 21:49.202
Presage.

21:49.226 --> 21:53.414
I feel strong hate.

21:53.438 --> 22:00.964
But silent.

22:00.988 --> 22:02.799
Ayura?

22:02.823 --> 22:06.219
Horses snorting, pawing at pebbles.

22:06.243 --> 22:10.598
Many horses.
They were hiding behind the river noise.

22:10.622 --> 22:12.642
Their cavalry barely reduced.

22:12.666 --> 22:16.062
They only sacrificed a few.

22:16.086 --> 22:18.940
They knew to hold back.

22:18.964 --> 22:21.609
To the village!

22:21.633 --> 22:24.571
This slope is the only way
off this mountain, yes?

22:24.595 --> 22:28.616
Ravines and sheer cliffs
on all sides except this.

22:28.640 --> 22:33.413
That's why this place was chosen
by the ancestors.

22:33.437 --> 22:36.666
We are the only Alkenny left.

22:36.690 --> 22:43.673
And I will be the last.

22:43.697 --> 22:47.218
Yes, yes. Oh, my God.

22:47.242 --> 22:50.847
It's a girl this time.

22:50.871 --> 22:55.226
Sinjay, Mama.

22:55.250 --> 23:07.503
God, no more.

23:15.854 --> 23:20.001
I heard the earth shaking.

23:20.025 --> 23:21.377
Did I imagine it?

23:21.401 --> 23:25.006
No, you did not imagine it.

23:25.030 --> 23:36.740
Sinjay, fresh water.

23:37.251 --> 23:42.273
Alkenny law says the first name
they hear you speak

23:42.297 --> 23:45.860
should be the name of their father.

23:45.884 --> 23:51.699
That way they will know it
in the soft parts of their soul.

23:51.723 --> 23:54.244
Do not say Baba Voss.

23:54.268 --> 24:06.923
It must be their true father,
or harm will come.

24:06.947 --> 24:14.597
Jerlamarel. Your father.

24:14.621 --> 24:20.186
Jerlamarel. Your father.

24:20.210 --> 24:23.022
Are you ready yet to tell me about him?

24:23.046 --> 24:25.358
About who he was?

24:25.382 --> 24:28.570
I've told you.

24:28.594 --> 24:32.240
He was a stranger.

24:32.264 --> 24:35.285
I wandered from my village.
I was lost in a blizzard.

24:35.309 --> 24:39.455
That's not what the owls tell me.

24:39.479 --> 24:46.212
So what do they tell you?

24:46.236 --> 24:57.696
The warriors are back.

24:59.917 --> 25:02.562
Baba Voss, you sacrificed the rocks?

25:02.586 --> 25:04.272
We had no choice.

25:04.296 --> 25:08.568
The Witchfinders and half
of Queen Kane's army's in the valley.

25:08.592 --> 25:11.321
Witchfinders?

25:11.345 --> 25:21.414
-There are no witches here.
-Arca.

25:21.438 --> 25:24.751
I declare the Alkenny parliament
in session.

25:24.775 --> 25:28.796
Hear this. Our wall is gone.

25:28.820 --> 25:33.468
We had no choice.
But the enemy remain in the valley.

25:33.492 --> 25:37.263
God Flame has raised rain, so they won't
attempt the slope in this weather.

25:37.287 --> 25:38.431
So we have time.

25:38.455 --> 25:41.768
Time for what? We're trapped.

25:41.792 --> 25:44.771
We have men and bear traps
on the perimeter.

25:44.795 --> 25:48.149
We'll string ropes to stop their horses.

25:48.173 --> 25:55.490
We must do it before the storm passes.

25:55.514 --> 25:59.285
Time is short.

25:59.309 --> 26:10.310
Prepare.

26:15.826 --> 26:17.470
Baba Voss?

26:17.494 --> 26:19.556
No, a bear.

26:19.580 --> 26:21.808
Maghra, are we three?

26:21.832 --> 26:25.353
You are four, Baba Voss.

26:25.377 --> 26:35.071
Go on, you big lump. Do not break them.

26:35.095 --> 26:37.740
A boy and a girl.

26:37.764 --> 26:39.117
I will leave you.

26:39.141 --> 26:42.412
No, no. Paris, stay.

26:42.436 --> 26:45.123
Be with us.

26:45.147 --> 26:50.295
Did the rocks take them all?

26:50.319 --> 26:54.340
Double blessings. God Flame.

26:54.364 --> 26:59.512
Baba, did the rocks kill them all?

26:59.536 --> 27:04.350
No.

27:04.374 --> 27:09.272
Then how will we survive the day?

27:09.296 --> 27:11.733
I don't know.

27:11.757 --> 27:14.944
They have horses and dogs.

27:14.968 --> 27:27.971
And when the storm is over,
they will come for us.

27:29.107 --> 27:33.963
All my life I wanted to find peace...

27:33.987 --> 27:40.261
to build a home,
take a woman and make babies.

27:40.285 --> 27:46.226
And now, at this last moment, I have two.

27:46.250 --> 27:53.358
One, two.

27:53.382 --> 28:00.824
And I would have loved them so much...

28:00.848 --> 28:03.284
as I've come to love you, Maghra.

28:03.308 --> 28:05.829
Yes. From the first moment...

28:05.853 --> 28:18.939
Baba Voss, you must come.
They have voted without you.

28:58.405 --> 29:01.634
Did you string the ropes?

29:01.658 --> 29:03.303
No, Baba Voss.

29:03.327 --> 29:06.556
We continued the parliamentary session
that you called.

29:06.580 --> 29:10.351
It was pointed out
that the Witchfinders don't come

29:10.375 --> 29:13.313
unless they believe there are witches.

29:13.337 --> 29:15.398
We've never been visited before--

29:15.422 --> 29:21.738
Until that bitch in there
came and dropped her litter among us.

29:21.762 --> 29:23.990
Paris, we have to do something.

29:24.014 --> 29:29.704
Stay. Stay. It is in hand.

29:29.728 --> 29:32.290
The moment has come.

29:32.314 --> 29:33.458
What moment?

29:33.482 --> 29:36.961
The night the stranger
delivered you to us...

29:36.985 --> 29:43.593
he left this message on my altar.

29:43.617 --> 29:47.430
From Jerlamarel.

29:47.454 --> 29:51.351
Prepare the babies for a long journey.

29:51.375 --> 29:54.229
A motion was passed that,

29:54.253 --> 29:58.608
perhaps, if we give the woman
and the babies to the Witchfinders,

29:58.632 --> 30:01.194
they might leave us alone.

30:01.218 --> 30:04.197
Baba Voss, we have no time.

30:04.221 --> 30:08.701
Those babies are not even yours.

30:08.725 --> 30:10.995
Very well.

30:11.019 --> 30:13.373
You must obey the vote.

30:13.397 --> 30:18.711
But it will be very difficult for anyone
to take a woman and two newborns

30:18.735 --> 30:22.048
down a mountain
without his arms or his legs.

30:22.072 --> 30:25.718
Now, Baba Voss, you're a big man,
but we are many.

30:25.742 --> 30:27.595
You can't kill us all.

30:27.619 --> 30:30.682
No, but I can kill the first six or seven.

30:30.706 --> 30:34.018
So those of you who wish
to be among that number,

30:34.042 --> 30:36.062
step forward.

30:36.086 --> 30:38.356
I have my blade ready
to count you to heaven.

30:38.380 --> 30:40.692
Arca.

30:40.716 --> 30:43.695
Quartermaster.

30:43.719 --> 30:45.697
I stand with Baba Voss!

30:45.721 --> 30:50.785
Ilun. Ayura.

30:50.809 --> 30:54.914
Killing rope. I stand with Baba Voss.

30:54.938 --> 30:58.793
Bow Lion. Kill Dancer.

30:58.817 --> 31:00.962
I stand with Baba.

31:00.986 --> 31:05.758
Belu. Kill Dancer.

31:05.782 --> 31:09.429
I say, Baba Voss... stand aside.

31:09.453 --> 31:14.767
Put down your weapons!
Put down your weapons!

31:14.791 --> 31:17.854
We are all Alkenny.

31:17.878 --> 31:20.023
Listen.

31:20.047 --> 31:23.193
Feel. The rain is stopping.

31:23.217 --> 31:25.820
The Witchfinders
are halfway up the mountain.

31:25.844 --> 31:28.490
Once a village has been identified
with witchcraft,

31:28.514 --> 31:31.034
the whole village must burn.

31:31.058 --> 31:33.203
That is their creed.

31:33.227 --> 31:36.498
Those babies will not buy your lives.

31:36.522 --> 31:38.333
And what would you suggest?

31:38.357 --> 31:42.754
You believe we are trapped here.
We are not.

31:42.778 --> 31:44.714
There is another way off this mountain.

31:44.738 --> 31:48.009
-If you're a bird, yes.
-No! There is a bridge.

31:48.033 --> 31:51.346
-What?
-Over the ravine. Beyond the chimes.

31:51.370 --> 31:53.890
The Alkenny have been on this mountain
for generations.

31:53.914 --> 31:55.141
There's never been a bridge.

31:55.165 --> 31:56.893
There is now, Dreamer.

31:56.917 --> 31:58.645
Built by who?

31:58.669 --> 32:00.355
Built by a man.

32:00.379 --> 32:01.856
No man could build a bridge that wide.

32:01.880 --> 32:04.609
Then, since time is short,
think of him as a god.

32:04.633 --> 32:07.153
-How do you know so much?
-No time for how.

32:07.177 --> 32:09.239
She knows because she's a witch, too.

32:09.263 --> 32:12.325
If I am a witch, I am also your only hope.

32:12.349 --> 32:13.993
Four hundred heartbeats away.

32:14.017 --> 32:16.204
Those who stay will burn.

32:16.228 --> 32:19.207
Women and children will be raped.

32:19.231 --> 32:21.960
Even if there is no bridge,

32:21.984 --> 32:25.713
the ravine is a kinder death.

32:25.737 --> 32:29.551
Gather your belongings.

32:29.575 --> 32:31.386
Do you know the way to this bridge?

32:31.410 --> 32:38.101
Yes. Have faith.

32:38.125 --> 32:42.063
Maghra. Do you think you can walk?

32:42.087 --> 32:44.190
-Yes.
-Yes?

32:44.214 --> 32:46.359
-Yes.
-Come, my love.

32:46.383 --> 32:50.989
Gather your things.
Bring only what you can carry or run with.

32:51.013 --> 32:53.116
Paris.

32:53.140 --> 32:56.035
Tell me, how will you find this bridge?

32:56.059 --> 32:58.329
He left me instructions.

32:58.353 --> 33:01.958
-Who's "he"?
-The babies' true father.

33:01.982 --> 33:16.361
Baba Voss, be the giant I know you are
and step over the pain of that.

33:23.921 --> 33:28.026
Come! This way!

33:28.050 --> 33:30.612
We should go no further than this.

33:30.636 --> 33:34.532
Have faith, Mama.

33:34.556 --> 33:44.542
Keep moving. Don't be afraid.

33:44.566 --> 33:48.880
Path here. The path to the bridge.

33:48.904 --> 33:50.882
This is madness.

33:50.906 --> 33:53.885
No man can build a bridge
that can span this divide.

33:53.909 --> 33:57.639
Horses 100 heartbeats away.

33:57.663 --> 34:08.914
Hurry!

34:25.315 --> 34:29.921
Salvation! Solid in the void!

34:29.945 --> 34:41.237
Form up to cross.

34:55.012 --> 35:01.119
Bring me Gether Bax.

35:01.143 --> 35:04.122
I am in the air. Miracle.

35:04.146 --> 35:12.922
I'm in the air!

35:12.946 --> 35:14.424
Hurry!

35:14.448 --> 35:15.842
I'll go.

35:15.866 --> 35:24.642
Staffs across the ropes.

35:24.666 --> 35:28.897
I'll be right behind you.

35:28.921 --> 35:35.361
I will stay and hold them off.

35:35.385 --> 35:38.907
You said there's no escape
towards the Sun Grave.

35:38.931 --> 35:40.366
There isn't.

35:40.390 --> 35:44.370
Only into the abyss,
which we know is certain death.

35:44.394 --> 35:46.664
I hear babies crying.

35:46.688 --> 35:59.983
Two newborns. Toward the Sun Grave.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.355
Oh, my God!

36:10.379 --> 36:11.689
Maghra!

36:11.713 --> 36:13.775
I'm safe!

36:13.799 --> 36:17.904
The bridge still holds!

36:17.928 --> 36:26.329
Go. Hurry. Be safe. Hurry.

36:26.353 --> 36:28.456
Ayuras!

36:28.480 --> 36:31.751
Only the sound of fast water. And close.

36:31.775 --> 36:35.880
Release the dogs!

36:35.904 --> 36:40.927
Go.

36:40.951 --> 36:43.721
Solid. Solid. Firm ground!

36:43.745 --> 36:55.289
Firm ground. Come. Come.

37:01.722 --> 37:04.826
Stand sharp. Come.

37:04.850 --> 37:16.602
Hurry. Hurry.

37:25.913 --> 37:32.854
Silence.

37:32.878 --> 37:38.818
Okay.

37:38.842 --> 37:44.741
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

37:44.765 --> 37:52.624
No.

37:52.648 --> 37:55.710
It's a bridge.

37:55.734 --> 37:59.464
Gether Bax!

37:59.488 --> 38:04.886
Cut him loose!

38:04.910 --> 38:07.847
We have been on this mountain for years.
There is no bridge.

38:07.871 --> 38:12.352
Feel!

38:12.376 --> 38:15.939
You first.

38:15.963 --> 38:18.733
No. The ravine is death.

38:18.757 --> 38:32.094
Staying is death. Walk!

38:43.991 --> 38:54.519
Men, follow.

38:54.543 --> 39:01.818
Clear the way!

39:01.842 --> 39:04.445
Wait!

39:04.469 --> 39:07.073
Help me!

39:07.097 --> 39:08.825
Who's there?

39:08.849 --> 39:13.246
It's me, Gether Bax!

39:13.270 --> 39:16.332
You bastards left me behind!

39:16.356 --> 39:22.380
Gether.

39:22.404 --> 39:33.488
Grab my hand.

39:44.510 --> 39:53.620
Herald.

39:53.644 --> 40:05.229
Message for the queen.

41:44.254 --> 41:56.381
Go. I wish to pray.

42:31.760 --> 42:34.447
Father...

42:34.471 --> 42:37.784
hidden from us...

42:37.808 --> 42:42.580
whose power we feel but cannot touch.

42:42.604 --> 42:47.961
Your will resides in this holy place.

42:47.985 --> 42:51.548
Give us this day
your power given by God Flame

42:51.572 --> 42:56.177
and taken from inside
the holy river water.

42:56.201 --> 43:00.014
Give guidance and clear paths.

43:00.038 --> 43:05.228
Condemn those that trespass against us.

43:05.252 --> 43:08.982
Give to us flame and smoke.

43:09.006 --> 43:14.028
For thine is the darkness, the power...

43:14.052 --> 43:21.077
and the glory.

43:21.101 --> 43:33.381
Forever and ever.

43:33.405 --> 43:41.514
Amen.

43:41.538 --> 43:43.474
Yes?

43:43.498 --> 43:48.813
News from the Sun Grave, Your Majesty.

43:48.837 --> 43:59.963
Come.

45:44.703 --> 45:45.972
He has planted his seed.

45:45.996 --> 45:56.107
Hush. Feel. I will talk.

45:56.131 --> 45:59.444
The devil who killed my sister...

45:59.468 --> 46:01.738
who preaches the Vision heresy,

46:01.762 --> 46:06.034
who was given the power of light,
Jerlamarel,

46:06.058 --> 46:09.162
not only lives.

46:09.186 --> 46:12.874
He has passed on his life.

46:12.898 --> 46:15.293
-Physician.
-Yes, Your Majesty?

46:15.317 --> 46:18.838
We've had this conversation
in the abstract.

46:18.862 --> 46:22.342
Keep still. It is no secret that we spoke.

46:22.366 --> 46:25.094
And once I asked you the question...

46:25.118 --> 46:31.351
"Do you believe the evil power of light
can be passed into a child?"

46:31.375 --> 46:35.522
No. I don't believe
it can be passed into a child.

46:35.546 --> 46:38.107
Don't lie to me.

46:38.131 --> 46:43.321
I hear it.

46:43.345 --> 46:46.908
It wastes so much time.

46:46.932 --> 46:51.371
Caution, fear.

46:51.395 --> 46:54.541
Fucking be honest!

46:54.565 --> 46:58.419
I honestly do not know.

46:58.443 --> 47:02.799
Your Majesty, Jerlamarel is one man.

47:02.823 --> 47:06.052
He served us food in this very room.

47:06.076 --> 47:11.516
He was born to a slave,
and this power he told you he had...

47:11.540 --> 47:15.854
perhaps he was a footman
attempting to impress his queen

47:15.878 --> 47:20.150
with stories he'd heard in the cradle.

47:20.174 --> 47:24.154
We have trouble here in our capital.

47:24.178 --> 47:27.282
The holy power from the river is failing.

47:27.306 --> 47:31.244
The people say we are losing God's favor.

47:31.268 --> 47:37.917
Perhaps it's time
to bring our best soldiers home.

47:37.941 --> 47:48.595
Kneel.

47:48.619 --> 47:51.681
You are forgetting...

47:51.705 --> 47:56.603
the evil of light
once almost destroyed the world.

47:56.627 --> 48:01.858
Men used it to control and twist
and alter God's intentions.

48:01.882 --> 48:08.948
Forests burned.
The air filled with poison.

48:08.972 --> 48:14.871
Lady Zee,
send word to the land of the Sun Grave.

48:14.895 --> 48:19.542
Their charge is no longer
to just find Jerlamarel.

48:19.566 --> 48:24.214
Their charge is to find his children...

48:24.238 --> 48:35.864
and bring them to me.

48:45.676 --> 48:48.363
This day...

48:48.387 --> 48:54.285
we have crossed into a new world.

48:54.309 --> 48:58.122
The man who built the bridge
to deliver us into it

48:58.146 --> 49:01.501
will show us the way forward.

49:01.525 --> 49:05.088
Paris, who is this man?

49:05.112 --> 49:13.179
His name is Jerlamarel.

49:13.203 --> 49:19.727
I knew him well, once.

49:19.751 --> 49:22.147
He's a heretic.

49:22.171 --> 49:29.237
The Witchfinders came in search of him
because he preaches a particular heresy.

49:29.261 --> 49:35.827
He told me he has a power
that we would call magical or evil...

49:35.851 --> 49:41.374
but which he says almost every human being
on earth once had.

49:41.398 --> 49:45.003
He preaches that the God bone
we use for weapons and tools

49:45.027 --> 49:49.507
was not made by the gods,
as we've been told.

49:49.531 --> 49:53.928
Nor the eternal smooth that never rots.

49:53.952 --> 49:56.931
Or the flat, straight mountains of Payan.

49:56.955 --> 49:59.684
They were all made by humans.

49:59.708 --> 50:06.483
Human beings like us, who all had
the same lost ability as he has.

50:06.507 --> 50:10.570
Jerlamarel said
he could not explain it to me.

50:10.594 --> 50:14.824
He only said he has the power to see.

50:14.848 --> 50:29.144
And if we follow his instruction,
we will find sanctuary.

50:32.699 --> 50:37.222
There is nothing behind us.

50:37.246 --> 50:44.270
If any object,
argue now for a better way forward.

50:44.294 --> 50:52.070
Then it is settled.

50:52.094 --> 50:57.158
There is a river beyond.

50:57.182 --> 51:00.286
Our Scentiers will dream its willows.

51:00.310 --> 51:08.962
And for 30 days and 30 nights,
we will follow its path.

51:08.986 --> 51:12.632
When the path beside the river disappears,

51:12.656 --> 51:18.346
we will walk in the water,
so no dogs can follow.

51:18.370 --> 51:32.624
Led by the music
that Jerlamarel has left behind.

51:34.553 --> 51:36.656
Soon thereafter,

51:36.680 --> 51:45.540
we will hear the rush of a waterfall
20 men high.

51:45.564 --> 51:51.045
And through that waterfall, a sanctuary.

51:51.069 --> 51:55.341
A place no one would dare wander.

51:55.365 --> 51:59.053
A place where we can rebuild again

51:59.077 --> 52:12.539
in peace and safety.

52:28.941 --> 52:31.419
Says there's a ladder here.

52:31.443 --> 52:36.466
Arca.

52:36.490 --> 52:38.176
I will go first.

52:38.200 --> 52:40.803
If it can hold my weight,
it can hold anything.

52:40.827 --> 52:51.912
Baba, please.

53:45.684 --> 53:56.852
It's safe!

53:58.113 --> 54:05.889
-Ice, ice, ice...
-Ice...

54:05.913 --> 54:09.684
Scentier, what's ahead?

54:09.708 --> 54:13.271
What has he left for us?

54:13.295 --> 54:24.546
Everything.

54:39.279 --> 54:51.240
This is where we build our new home.

55:18.527 --> 55:24.050
It feels like paradise.

55:24.074 --> 55:26.469
But, Baba...

55:26.493 --> 55:29.514
you must know...

55:29.538 --> 55:32.475
you will be chief of a tribe

55:32.499 --> 55:38.314
that must hide from the world
and the Witchfinders forever.

55:38.338 --> 55:40.275
Know this.

55:40.299 --> 55:43.903
One day we could be found.

55:43.927 --> 55:56.305
We must be vigilant.
