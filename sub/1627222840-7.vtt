WEBVTT

00:10.375 --> 00:12.291
Assault unit is approaching.

00:13.666 --> 00:16.250
Move! I want a clean intervention.

00:16.333 --> 00:18.625
They're armed and extremely dangerous.

00:19.583 --> 00:20.958
Let's go, fast!

00:21.041 --> 00:22.291
First floor, clear.

00:22.916 --> 00:25.208
I want every floor cleared. Let's go!

00:25.291 --> 00:27.083
Watch all the exits.

00:27.708 --> 00:28.916
Second floor, clear.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.250
Please…

00:46.916 --> 00:48.666
-Police!
-Let's go!

00:49.250 --> 00:51.875
-Hands up!
-Police!

00:51.958 --> 00:53.375
Colonel, are you okay?

00:54.500 --> 00:56.750
My wife.

00:57.458 --> 00:58.833
Let's go!

01:01.250 --> 01:02.083
Luis!

01:04.250 --> 01:05.125
No one's here.

01:05.208 --> 01:06.625
How long has it been?

01:07.500 --> 01:09.083
I don't know. A few minutes.

01:09.166 --> 01:11.000
It's Sierra. She's carrying a baby.

01:11.083 --> 01:12.625
No one has left the building.

01:12.708 --> 01:15.875
Check every apartment.
If nobody opens, break the door down.

01:15.958 --> 01:17.583
Set up a cage operation

01:17.666 --> 01:20.375
with a one-mile perimeter
no one can get out of.

01:20.458 --> 01:22.541
Bravo 41 calling all available units.

01:22.625 --> 01:25.916
Cage Operation, Chamberí district.
Limits, Valdebebas, and Canillas.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.958
I repeat, Bravo 41
calling all available units.

01:31.208 --> 01:32.416
Listen, ma'am.

01:32.500 --> 01:35.166
Everything's going to be okay,
but you can't scream.

01:42.875 --> 01:44.166
Give me the baby.

01:47.291 --> 01:49.750
And my glasses. I need my glasses.

01:49.833 --> 01:50.958
Let's go, quick.

01:55.791 --> 01:57.291
-Open the door!
-Police!

02:08.708 --> 02:11.416
You're bleeding.
You're not going to go, are you?

02:11.500 --> 02:14.500
I have to go back.
This is the final stretch.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.666
But I promise you one thing.

02:18.333 --> 02:19.833
This is my last stretch.

02:21.541 --> 02:24.583
Call in the army. Declare martial law.

02:24.666 --> 02:27.375
We're going to search the neighborhood
door to door.

02:37.833 --> 02:39.250
No, please--

02:40.125 --> 02:41.083
Calm down.

02:42.208 --> 02:43.416
Open the door now!

02:45.416 --> 02:47.208
Police! Open the door!

02:56.750 --> 02:57.708
Let's go!

02:57.791 --> 02:58.833
Police! Open the door!

03:08.166 --> 03:09.833
Police! Open the door!

03:15.125 --> 03:17.083
Police! Come on! Let's go!

03:26.291 --> 03:27.125
See you later.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.250
-What's going on?
-Move over.

03:41.916 --> 03:43.166
What the hell?

03:50.750 --> 03:51.750
Police!

03:51.833 --> 03:53.750
Open the door! Police!

03:58.625 --> 03:59.916
The baby.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.375
The baby's asleep.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.291
Let's go!

04:23.833 --> 04:26.125
-The baby.
-The baby's fine.

04:34.583 --> 04:35.833
Good evening.

04:40.083 --> 04:40.958
Let's go!

04:42.208 --> 04:43.041
Clear!

04:45.208 --> 04:46.875
They escaped through the courtyard.

04:55.166 --> 04:56.791
-Go!
-Let's go!

05:05.625 --> 05:07.375
Everyone go to the courtyard!

05:09.208 --> 05:10.666
-Your glasses.
-What?

05:11.166 --> 05:12.958
Your sunglasses. It's dark out.

05:13.041 --> 05:14.750
So what? Who cares?

05:14.833 --> 05:16.583
-Take them off.
-Shut up.

05:21.208 --> 05:22.208
They're coming.

05:22.708 --> 05:25.291
-Shut up.
-They're coming.

05:26.666 --> 05:30.250
Calling all units.
They left through the restaurant.

05:30.333 --> 05:32.375
-Turn around!
-Legs apart!

05:35.500 --> 05:37.958
We'll get there faster
if we take the subway.

05:39.750 --> 05:42.083
Turn around! Hands against the wall!

05:48.708 --> 05:49.625
Professor?

06:10.541 --> 06:13.041
Professor, do you copy?

06:15.666 --> 06:17.125
Quiet, boys.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.041
-Professor?
-Professor?

06:34.333 --> 06:36.208
-Marseille to Benjamín.
-Copy.

06:36.291 --> 06:37.416
The Professor's gone.

06:38.458 --> 06:39.333
Come again?

06:39.416 --> 06:42.250
I think Alicia Sierra
kidnapped him, again.

06:42.833 --> 06:44.833
My men are here. What should we do?

06:44.916 --> 06:47.000
Do as the Professor asked. Take command.

06:47.083 --> 06:49.375
I'll take the three cars
to the stormwater tank.

06:49.458 --> 06:51.708
I have to tie up all loose ends.

07:08.958 --> 07:10.166
What?

07:12.375 --> 07:13.375
Let's go to 2B.

07:18.208 --> 07:19.083
Come on.

07:24.708 --> 07:25.583
There.

07:29.916 --> 07:30.916
No one's home.

07:47.625 --> 07:48.500
Come on.

08:14.541 --> 08:15.375
Clear.

08:21.708 --> 08:23.083
Fuck, it's a cat.

08:30.541 --> 08:33.625
"Plants, twice a week.
Cat, one bowl a day."

08:34.125 --> 08:35.291
"Thanks, Herminia."

08:36.375 --> 08:37.916
The plants were watered today.

08:38.416 --> 08:40.875
So Herminia won't be back until tomorrow.

08:41.833 --> 08:44.416
The government has declared martial law.

08:45.708 --> 08:47.666
We're here to protect you.

08:48.666 --> 08:49.583
Quick!

08:51.083 --> 08:52.833
Let's go!

08:52.916 --> 08:55.375
This is starting to look like
the Warsaw ghetto.

08:57.291 --> 08:59.125
They're going to search every house.

10:14.041 --> 10:15.375
Come here.

10:17.083 --> 10:20.291
Is it possible my illness
is starting to get to you?

10:20.375 --> 10:21.333
It is, isn't it?

10:21.833 --> 10:22.666
No.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.916
-No.
-Yes.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.250
It's just that I'm moved
by this wonderful plan with the gold.

10:31.750 --> 10:33.750
There are a few details I still…

10:35.791 --> 10:37.416
-Go on.
-Yeah.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.875
-How to get the gold out, for instance.
-Grit.

10:40.958 --> 10:44.875
We're going to turn
90 tons of gold into rice.

10:44.958 --> 10:47.666
And then, jet propulsion.

10:47.750 --> 10:51.000
We'll get it out of the building
using a pressure pump.

10:51.083 --> 10:52.500
-With a pump?
-Yes.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.083
Through the pipes?

10:55.250 --> 10:57.333
Is there a pressure pump in the bank?

10:57.416 --> 10:58.500
-Of course not.
-Right.

10:58.583 --> 11:00.583
We had to go to Norway to get one.

11:01.166 --> 11:03.875
From an oil platform.
What do you think about that?

11:05.083 --> 11:08.541
There was also one in Saudi Arabia,
but I was too lazy to go that far.

11:08.625 --> 11:09.583
Of course.

11:09.666 --> 11:10.791
What matters, Sergio,

11:10.875 --> 11:15.208
is that we're going to have a geyser
of golden light flowing through the pipes.

11:15.291 --> 11:16.791
There's no margin for error.

11:17.291 --> 11:20.416
Andrés, the whole plan
is a margin for error.

11:20.500 --> 11:24.041
How old are those pipes?
Fifty, 70 years old?

11:28.250 --> 11:29.291
A hundred.

11:29.375 --> 11:33.291
Do you think they were designed to support
the flow of gold under pressure?

11:33.375 --> 11:34.833
They'll hold!

11:36.166 --> 11:38.750
Where will the gold be delivered?
To a sewer?

11:38.833 --> 11:39.666
No!

11:41.291 --> 11:44.291
I love this.
In the biggest stormwater tank in Europe.

11:45.541 --> 11:47.791
In a stormwater tank? What if it rains?

11:48.500 --> 11:51.416
What if it starts pouring that day?
It would collapse!

11:51.500 --> 11:55.416
You can kiss your plan and life goodbye,
simply because it rained.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.125
No, it's not science, it's…

11:57.916 --> 11:58.875
wishful thinking.

11:58.958 --> 12:00.583
It's optimistic science!

12:00.666 --> 12:02.083
What are you talking about?

12:02.166 --> 12:04.083
-It's hopeful science.
-Who's talking?

12:04.166 --> 12:07.458
The brain of someone planning a heist
or the brain of a child?

12:08.041 --> 12:09.041
A child's.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.166
I'm proud of that.

12:13.750 --> 12:16.458
-I'm Peter Pan himself.
-I see.

12:16.541 --> 12:19.500
No one's going to make me lose hope,
not you or anyone else.

12:19.583 --> 12:23.750
Because only then,
through willful immaturity,

12:24.333 --> 12:26.416
can one achieve great things.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.375
The sort of things that other,

12:28.458 --> 12:31.250
mature people, serious people,
can never achieve.

12:31.333 --> 12:34.541
They can't even imagine it
because they're all so very sensible!

12:37.875 --> 12:43.125
And for those of us who think,
is there anything we can hold onto?

12:44.083 --> 12:45.291
Anything?

12:45.375 --> 12:47.625
Because I'd love to check the facts.

12:47.708 --> 12:52.875
Martín has it all figured out.
Every last detail.

12:54.375 --> 12:57.166
And he'd be delighted
to share it with to you.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.041
Come on, guys, let's go.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.375
The waterwheel goes last, okay Darko?

13:05.458 --> 13:07.041
The waterwheel goes last.

13:08.833 --> 13:10.041
Benjamín, are you there?

13:11.333 --> 13:13.291
Yes, Miss Lisbon.

13:19.291 --> 13:21.500
The Professor has disappeared.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.500
Wait a minute.

13:27.583 --> 13:30.000
What do you mean
"the Professor has disappeared"?

13:30.083 --> 13:31.916
Is he in the Bermuda Triangle?

13:32.000 --> 13:34.208
How would I know? I don't know.

13:35.958 --> 13:36.791
Fuck…

13:36.875 --> 13:41.083
But we have to make a decision right now.
What should we do with the gold?

13:42.166 --> 13:44.708
I'm sorry, are you planning a referendum?

13:45.666 --> 13:48.333
Because I don't give a shit
about democracy.

13:51.333 --> 13:52.666
We're getting the gold out.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.041
There's no room for debate.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.750
If you let them debate,
they'll draw their weapons.

13:57.833 --> 14:01.083
Let me draw mine first.
Don't fuck with me, we know each other.

14:01.166 --> 14:04.041
The police might be
at the gold's exit point.

14:05.791 --> 14:10.541
The police aren't in the stormwater tank.
The plan is still on, understood?

14:10.625 --> 14:15.083
If that were the case, we'd be committing
the stupidest robbery in the world.

14:15.166 --> 14:17.833
Melting 90 tons of gold
to hand it over to the police.

14:17.916 --> 14:20.625
I said the police aren't
at the stormwater tank.

14:20.708 --> 14:24.208
The gold is worth nothing to us here.
Do you get it, sweetie?

14:24.291 --> 14:26.083
We're holding the gold hostage.

14:26.583 --> 14:27.791
Great.

14:28.291 --> 14:31.208
We take the hostage,
offer it to Tamayo, and negotiate.

14:31.291 --> 14:33.875
Is that your master plan?
Are you the genius?

14:36.500 --> 14:38.500
Yes, honey, I'm a fucking genius,

14:38.583 --> 14:42.000
and I have the machinery
down there to prove it, don't worry.

14:42.083 --> 14:43.708
Is that all you care about?

14:43.791 --> 14:46.000
Proving that your wonderful plan works?

14:46.083 --> 14:48.083
Yes, but also about saving your lives.

14:48.166 --> 14:51.000
We're going to do that
by getting the gold out of here.

14:52.333 --> 14:53.500
Palermo is right.

14:54.791 --> 14:56.541
There are only two people out there

14:56.625 --> 14:59.458
who can tell them
how we're getting the gold out.

14:59.541 --> 15:03.416
The Professor, and he's not going to tell,
and Alicia Sierra.

15:03.500 --> 15:06.875
She'll use that information
to negotiate and get off the hook.

15:08.166 --> 15:09.875
And I assure you

15:09.958 --> 15:13.041
that negotiating
with Intelligence will be tough.

15:13.125 --> 15:14.666
It'll take hours.

15:14.750 --> 15:18.416
We'll have time to get the gold out.
That's what we're going to do.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.958
This woman has sex appeal and balls.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.291
We're going to get the gold out of here!

15:28.833 --> 15:30.291
We're going to get it out.

15:30.375 --> 15:32.958
Just then,
Palermo recovered his enthusiasm.

15:33.708 --> 15:35.958
The last time he had
that sparkle in his eyes

15:36.041 --> 15:37.583
was five years ago,

15:38.625 --> 15:41.083
when someone woke him up
in the middle of the night.

15:42.750 --> 15:44.500
I told him the plan.

15:49.583 --> 15:51.000
What did he say?

15:51.625 --> 15:53.291
Let's say he thought it was

15:54.500 --> 15:56.125
a real wonder.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.958
Let me be precise.

16:01.750 --> 16:04.541
He said it's the most beautiful thing
he's ever heard.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.083
Don't fuck with me. Are you serious?

16:11.125 --> 16:12.041
Martín,

16:12.625 --> 16:14.250
I told him the gist of it.

16:14.333 --> 16:17.416
He wants you to explain
all the technical details.

16:18.166 --> 16:20.916
So, it's your turn.

16:21.708 --> 16:22.916
No shit.

16:23.541 --> 16:25.166
Oh my God, I can't believe it.

16:27.500 --> 16:28.416
Let's see.

16:29.208 --> 16:32.583
Houndstooth? Tartan?
Something that exudes intellect.

16:32.666 --> 16:35.833
I'd say that's a bit sophisticated
for 3:00 a.m.

16:35.916 --> 16:39.750
A touch of genius would be good,
but go for something casual.

16:42.958 --> 16:46.083
For Palermo and Berlin,
"maturity" meant the same thing,

16:46.166 --> 16:48.291
the end of hopes and dreams,

16:48.375 --> 16:51.625
and starting to approach life
with a certain bitter awareness.

16:52.125 --> 16:56.750
After all, maturing, like growing old,
consists of gradually discarding dreams.

17:05.666 --> 17:07.166
Bogotá, get in the water!

17:09.083 --> 17:10.458
-Bogotá!
-What?

17:10.541 --> 17:11.583
Get in the water!

17:14.625 --> 17:19.041
You didn't have to get him out of bed now.
We could have done it tomorrow morning.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.583
It's a great privilege for me to be here.

17:21.666 --> 17:24.833
What do your curiosity
and sharp intellect require?

17:24.916 --> 17:25.958
Tell me.

17:26.708 --> 17:29.125
Let's say we've turned
the 90 tons into grit.

17:29.208 --> 17:30.416
-Yes?
-Now what?

17:31.833 --> 17:36.083
Now we put the diver back in the water,
only, this time, with two hoses.

17:39.125 --> 17:42.666
Having completely ransacked the vault
like King Tut's tomb,

17:42.750 --> 17:44.750
the diver will make the key connection.

17:44.833 --> 17:47.041
That will allow us
to move the gold off-site.

17:47.125 --> 17:49.041
-How?
-We have the vault, right?

17:49.125 --> 17:52.458
There's 3,170 gallons of water.
That will be our driving force.

17:54.166 --> 17:57.416
Through this black pipe,
the water goes into this pump,

17:57.500 --> 17:59.083
where it'll mix with the gold.

17:59.166 --> 18:03.333
And the 90 tons of grit will flow
through this red hose,

18:03.416 --> 18:07.000
smoothly, towards the drainage system.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.583
-Diameter of the hose?
-Five inches.

18:09.666 --> 18:13.125
You can't get enough pressure
to get the gold out with that hose.

18:13.208 --> 18:14.125
Exactly.

18:15.166 --> 18:19.500
Because, for now, the gold will be
sleeping peacefully in the drainpipes.

18:19.583 --> 18:21.041
The real pressure

18:23.166 --> 18:24.791
will come a little later.

18:25.791 --> 18:28.000
We will proceed to open every door.

18:28.583 --> 18:31.500
We are prepared to use force,
and will not allow…

18:31.583 --> 18:33.041
Delta Unit entering.

18:36.458 --> 18:37.375
What are you doing?

18:39.791 --> 18:41.041
We're going to hide.

18:43.166 --> 18:44.625
Let's go, move it!

18:44.708 --> 18:46.375
Let's go!

19:05.458 --> 19:08.000
Armed forces. Open the door, please.

19:09.250 --> 19:10.291
Hurry up.

19:11.208 --> 19:12.208
Open the door!

19:13.958 --> 19:15.541
Open the door!

19:19.916 --> 19:21.666
Armed forces! Open the door!

19:21.750 --> 19:23.333
Open the door, please!

19:24.500 --> 19:26.541
Open the door! Armed forces!

19:28.625 --> 19:30.333
Open the door!

19:30.416 --> 19:32.000
Get the doorkeeper.

19:34.916 --> 19:36.000
Open the door!

19:37.083 --> 19:38.833
-Open the door!
-Hurry up!

19:38.916 --> 19:39.875
What's going on?

19:43.500 --> 19:46.791
-No one's home. They're on vacation.
-Open it anyway.

19:50.916 --> 19:52.416
Everyone on guard.

20:00.250 --> 20:02.625
-This isn't it, 2A…
-Come on, man. Hurry up.

20:02.708 --> 20:05.208
These things take time.
It's not that easy.

20:05.916 --> 20:07.041
Come on.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.375
Come here, baby girl.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.250
Don't you know which one it is?

20:24.500 --> 20:25.416
Get down.

20:29.583 --> 20:31.041
Delta Unit entering.

20:44.791 --> 20:46.250
Alfa Unit standing by.

20:47.708 --> 20:50.541
Bravo Unit, first floor checked and clear.

20:55.375 --> 20:56.375
Clear!

21:02.166 --> 21:05.208
Delta Unit,
send the doorkeeper to the third floor.

21:30.833 --> 21:32.500
Bedroom clear. Let's go.

22:09.750 --> 22:12.250
It's all clear. Let's go.

22:21.666 --> 22:22.791
They're gone.

22:25.583 --> 22:26.583
They're gone.

22:52.875 --> 22:57.375
Gentlemen! Today we're making our mark
on the universal history of larceny!

22:58.208 --> 23:00.833
Let's go, boys!
Let's make history together.

23:00.916 --> 23:03.375
-Come on!
-Let's go!

23:07.208 --> 23:09.208
This is where the next stage begins.

23:09.291 --> 23:13.083
When we move the gold
that was sleeping in the drainpipes.

23:13.166 --> 23:15.583
That would cause the pipes to clog.

23:16.166 --> 23:19.208
That's why we have a second pump,
the one we stole in Norway.

23:19.291 --> 23:20.458
Connect the pump!

23:21.041 --> 23:22.250
Let's go, gentlemen!

23:22.833 --> 23:24.541
Isn't she beautiful? I love her.

23:27.083 --> 23:31.791
It's a technical marvel,
5,300 kilowatts of power.

23:31.875 --> 23:36.166
Sergio, that means we'll move the gold
at 10.7 feet per second. That's crazy!

23:36.250 --> 23:37.625
There's one problem.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.458
Now he's wondering about…?

23:39.541 --> 23:41.791
The loss of pressure due to friction.

23:42.333 --> 23:45.208
Darcy-Weisbach equation.
It's measured to the millimeter.

23:45.291 --> 23:48.041
-The only problem we might have…
-Is too much pressure.

23:48.125 --> 23:49.166
Open the valves!

23:49.250 --> 23:52.875
The pump has a pressure regulator.
We'll control it ourselves.

23:53.541 --> 23:55.208
I'll activate the pump.

23:55.291 --> 23:57.875
The pump will gain traction
and push the gold.

23:57.958 --> 24:01.458
And 91 minutes and 37 seconds later,

24:02.791 --> 24:09.083
our booty will have traveled
the 11.1 miles between the gold vault

24:09.166 --> 24:12.833
and point B, commonly referred to
as the "stormwater tank."

24:12.916 --> 24:16.583
And there, manna will rain down

24:16.666 --> 24:18.250
from heaven.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.333
Am I crazy
or am I the only one who sees this?

24:26.791 --> 24:28.208
Bogotá, pressure!

24:32.291 --> 24:33.916
Three thousand kilopascals!

24:35.166 --> 24:36.625
Three thousand five hundred!

24:39.875 --> 24:40.958
Let's go, darling.

24:41.500 --> 24:42.375
Four thousand!

24:42.458 --> 24:43.708
Come on, precious.

24:44.500 --> 24:47.416
-Let's go, for God's sake!
-Four thousand five hundred!

24:48.375 --> 24:49.750
Five thousand! Now!

25:06.416 --> 25:07.250
Nothing yet.

25:07.958 --> 25:11.375
Relax, we still have a few seconds.
Don't get anxious, man.

25:14.250 --> 25:15.375
We're getting there.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.041
Ten.

25:20.916 --> 25:21.750
Nine.

25:24.583 --> 25:25.625
Eight.

25:28.791 --> 25:29.666
Seven.

25:31.708 --> 25:32.708
Six.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.041
Five.

25:40.333 --> 25:41.250
Four.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.333
Three.

25:47.083 --> 25:47.958
Two.

25:50.083 --> 25:50.958
One.

25:54.208 --> 25:55.500
Now!

26:08.208 --> 26:09.500
Benjamín, do you copy?

26:09.583 --> 26:10.458
Nothing yet.

26:23.875 --> 26:28.041
I repeat, there's nothing here, Palermo.
Maybe there was a miscalculation.

26:28.916 --> 26:30.416
God damn it!

26:32.375 --> 26:35.375
Science doesn't live on numbers
and calculations alone.

26:35.875 --> 26:37.125
Have a little faith.

26:38.250 --> 26:39.833
A little love too.

26:48.500 --> 26:49.750
Come on, darling.

26:50.250 --> 26:51.791
It's not just about the gold.

26:52.291 --> 26:54.916
It's all the nights
we spent planning together.

27:01.625 --> 27:02.875
The hours and hours

27:03.916 --> 27:06.333
we spent stuck on the same problems.

27:07.791 --> 27:11.625
The joy and euphoria on the days
when we found the solution.

27:12.875 --> 27:16.166
Those were the best times of my life.
I'm begging you.

27:16.250 --> 27:18.625
Please don't let all this be a mistake.

27:18.708 --> 27:21.416
Don't make it all an illusion.
I'm begging you.

27:22.166 --> 27:25.625
Please, my dear, come on.
Please, let's go, damn it.

27:26.250 --> 27:29.791
Come on, damn it. You can do it.
Come on, dear God. Come on!

27:30.500 --> 27:31.708
Let's go!

27:49.666 --> 27:50.916
It's coming out!

27:51.708 --> 27:53.333
The gold is coming out!

27:53.416 --> 27:55.041
-We did it!
-Yeah!

28:13.541 --> 28:15.583
Guys, set up the waterwheel.

28:23.625 --> 28:25.333
Benjamín, start making the ingots.

28:25.416 --> 28:28.125
Let's go! Start making ingots!

28:37.125 --> 28:38.333
We did it, Tokyo.

28:45.166 --> 28:46.083
We did it.

28:46.166 --> 28:51.708
A rate of 14,582 gallons of water
and gold per minute, brother.

28:52.583 --> 28:54.416
It's poetry. It's pure poetry.

29:07.791 --> 29:08.791
How was your shower?

29:15.000 --> 29:17.833
Too bad there's no men's clothes here,
right Victoria?

29:28.791 --> 29:30.000
When did you last eat?

29:32.291 --> 29:33.375
What day is it today?

29:36.291 --> 29:38.208
I'll try to cook something hot.

29:58.083 --> 30:01.958
This Harris's Hawk,
a bird of prey, is an expert hunter.

30:05.583 --> 30:09.916
As soon as it detects its prey,
it swoops down at full speed.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.458
This will do you good.

30:12.833 --> 30:15.583
I can't remember the last time
someone took care of me.

30:27.458 --> 30:28.458
Actually, I can.

30:30.666 --> 30:31.708
My husband.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.291
I didn't shed a tear at his funeral.

30:37.375 --> 30:40.666
I felt nothing
while torturing Aníbal Cortés.

30:42.541 --> 30:43.583
Nothing.

30:45.916 --> 30:48.041
My career is ruined. Still, nothing.

31:00.875 --> 31:02.125
All I've done is…

31:05.666 --> 31:07.083
chase you.

31:11.541 --> 31:13.041
I didn't feel the nausea

31:13.750 --> 31:14.875
or the exhaustion,

31:15.916 --> 31:16.833
because I…

31:21.166 --> 31:23.416
I thought if I chased you fast enough…

31:27.125 --> 31:28.750
…the sadness wouldn't catch me.

31:31.625 --> 31:32.500
And now, look.

31:33.416 --> 31:34.291
Here we are.

31:38.791 --> 31:39.750
Here we are.

31:46.625 --> 31:47.625
Can we…

31:51.500 --> 31:56.000
…pretend you're a friend who came over
to cook and see the baby.

31:56.083 --> 32:00.208
This may be the last normal day
we have in the next 25 years.

32:03.125 --> 32:05.375
Let's pretend the police aren't out there.

32:06.416 --> 32:09.125
And we'll eat,
and you can ask me silly things,

32:09.208 --> 32:11.833
things about the baby,
until she falls asleep,

32:11.916 --> 32:13.083
while we watch TV.

32:19.166 --> 32:20.083
Is that okay?

32:23.791 --> 32:24.625
Of course.

32:25.916 --> 32:27.083
Don't get me wrong.

32:27.708 --> 32:28.916
I'm not your friend.

32:30.833 --> 32:32.000
I never will be.

32:33.375 --> 32:34.875
I'll never be your friend.

32:40.166 --> 32:42.583
I see us as a marriage of convenience.

32:44.833 --> 32:46.083
Or something like that.

32:48.916 --> 32:49.833
Eat.

32:52.208 --> 32:53.875
It's good. Thanks.

32:57.250 --> 32:58.083
Say something.

33:06.375 --> 33:07.791
Over the last few hours…

33:11.708 --> 33:12.875
…I've lost two…

33:13.958 --> 33:17.500
very important people.

33:19.666 --> 33:21.791
Not for the plan, not for the heist.

33:24.166 --> 33:25.500
They were important to me.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.416
In my personal life.

33:30.791 --> 33:32.500
And I'm not going to let

33:34.291 --> 33:35.791
anyone else go down

33:36.833 --> 33:37.875
for this heist.

33:45.750 --> 33:47.250
I won't let you go down.

33:51.208 --> 33:52.208
Okay.

33:56.916 --> 33:58.083
So,

33:58.166 --> 34:03.875
you'd better get used
to this sort of situation.

34:05.041 --> 34:09.416
I won't allow Victoria to grow up
in a prison maternity ward.

34:24.666 --> 34:26.291
I won't arrest you either.

34:30.625 --> 34:31.583
Sounds good.

34:45.958 --> 34:49.000
Like a velociraptor,
it chases its prey on the ground.

34:49.083 --> 34:50.041
Sergio…

34:52.875 --> 34:54.875
We need to get you some new shoes.

34:57.125 --> 35:00.625
The kangaroo rat runs for its life,
but the chicks…

35:03.333 --> 35:06.166
We need to rebuild the bone,
and anchor it to a titanium plate.

35:06.250 --> 35:08.000
You need general anesthesia.

35:08.083 --> 35:08.958
What?

35:10.041 --> 35:12.583
No way. I'm not going to sleep.

35:13.875 --> 35:18.166
From the waist up, I'm a watchman.

35:19.083 --> 35:21.791
From the waist down, I'm a patient.

35:22.583 --> 35:26.833
Doctor, you do your job, I can take it.

35:28.583 --> 35:29.541
Use an epidural.

35:37.458 --> 35:38.750
He'll be crippled.

35:39.833 --> 35:41.041
Cripples scare people.

35:41.125 --> 35:44.958
If we're going to go to prison,
scaring people isn't all that bad.

35:45.541 --> 35:49.875
To tell you the truth,
I can't even imagine what prison is like.

35:49.958 --> 35:53.958
A cell? A cell is a horrible experience.

35:55.083 --> 35:55.916
Horrible.

35:56.583 --> 36:00.208
But I think that the worst part
isn't losing your freedom.

36:01.458 --> 36:03.125
It's being deprived of affection.

36:04.125 --> 36:07.291
I don't know. Physical touch,

36:08.375 --> 36:11.791
wanting to hug your child,
or wanting your mom to hug you,

36:13.041 --> 36:14.250
and not having them there.

36:17.708 --> 36:19.083
Then there's Sergio.

36:19.166 --> 36:21.958
Now that I've finally found
something passable…

36:22.041 --> 36:23.041
My God.

36:23.958 --> 36:26.958
Twenty-five years in prison
will wipe it all away,

36:27.041 --> 36:30.958
because no relationship
can withstand that absence.

36:33.708 --> 36:39.166
Or you can spend 25 years thinking
that everything will be the same,

36:39.250 --> 36:43.708
and suddenly, when you have the chance
to be with that person and kiss them,

36:43.791 --> 36:44.958
shit, you realize

36:46.083 --> 36:48.833
how much time has passed, right?

36:48.916 --> 36:53.041
And that you've spent years romanticizing
about something that isn't…

36:53.125 --> 36:55.125
that isn't there, that doesn't exist.

36:59.625 --> 37:01.833
You need to know I kissed Denver,

37:01.916 --> 37:05.750
and I swear I'm telling you this now
because it meant nothing.

37:05.833 --> 37:09.500
I know I shouldn't have done it,
but I just couldn't help it.

37:09.583 --> 37:14.250
I've been obsessed with him for years.
Today I realized there's nothing there.

37:20.458 --> 37:21.833
Hey.

37:36.958 --> 37:39.375
Do you have anything for stress, Doctor?

37:43.208 --> 37:45.625
An antipsychotic would be better.

38:25.666 --> 38:28.916
I passed the service corridors.
I'm at the junction.

38:30.083 --> 38:31.291
Listen, go left.

38:36.166 --> 38:39.291
In 65 feet, on your left
will be a trapdoor, and you're there.

39:30.250 --> 39:32.291
Every single ingot must be marked.

39:32.791 --> 39:34.291
Any problems with smelting?

39:48.208 --> 39:49.791
This is fun, isn't it?

39:50.875 --> 39:53.000
Giddyap! Let's go!

40:13.541 --> 40:15.666
Quickly! Come on, let's go guys!

40:15.750 --> 40:17.041
Let's go!

40:21.250 --> 40:23.583
We're on the first batch of ingots.

40:23.666 --> 40:25.833
Perfect. We're almost done here.

40:25.916 --> 40:27.875
For the love of God, let's go.

40:27.958 --> 40:28.916
Hey.

40:30.250 --> 40:32.166
-Is Lisbon single?
-What?

40:33.458 --> 40:35.458
Does she have anyone on the outside?

40:42.458 --> 40:43.916
Why the fuck do you ask?

40:44.791 --> 40:47.583
It's just that I saw her
twisting Rio's arm, and…

40:47.666 --> 40:48.916
And what?

40:49.000 --> 40:52.625
Ballsy chicks like her
get me hotter than the fucking forge.

40:53.875 --> 40:57.791
Well, she was in
a really fucked up relationship.

40:58.375 --> 41:00.875
She needs someone
to restore her faith in men.

41:00.958 --> 41:04.458
Yes. You need to just go for it,
but aggressively.

41:05.333 --> 41:08.166
She's got a big personality.
No beating around the bush.

41:08.250 --> 41:10.208
No strolls in the park.

41:10.291 --> 41:11.458
-Exactly.
-Got it?

41:11.541 --> 41:15.166
Gloves off, no beating around the bush,
knife between your teeth.

41:15.250 --> 41:17.541
I recommend you do the following.

41:18.125 --> 41:21.083
As soon as you get the chance,
make out with her.

41:21.166 --> 41:25.458
In an elevator, the bathroom, wherever.
Remember, she just got out of jail.

41:25.541 --> 41:27.958
Do you know what I mean? Do you?

41:28.041 --> 41:28.958
Show no mercy.

41:36.250 --> 41:37.708
What's up with you?

41:41.125 --> 41:42.000
It's that…

41:43.791 --> 41:45.791
I was unfaithful to my wife.

41:49.041 --> 41:50.125
With a hostage?

41:51.791 --> 41:52.708
With Manila.

41:55.291 --> 41:56.375
With Manila.

41:58.708 --> 42:00.333
And did you go all the way?

42:00.416 --> 42:04.375
Well, I didn't go all the way,
but I kissed her on the mouth.

42:04.958 --> 42:05.916
I moved first.

42:12.166 --> 42:13.708
Heat of the moment, no big deal.

42:14.291 --> 42:16.666
Let's go, guys. It's time to shine!

42:16.750 --> 42:18.375
How is it "no big deal"?

42:18.458 --> 42:21.916
A few seconds later,
I kissed Stockholm in the same place.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.916
One's spit got in the other's mouth.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.166
She's shooting up morphine
to overcome post-traumatic stress

42:27.250 --> 42:30.250
while I've been an ass.
I don't know how to tell her.

42:34.125 --> 42:35.666
Stop right there, okay?

42:36.416 --> 42:39.375
Never, ever, in your fucking life,

42:40.208 --> 42:41.916
do you admit you cheated.

42:42.875 --> 42:45.625
Especially not half an hour
after doing it.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.333
If you feel guilty,
you fucking deal with it.

42:51.416 --> 42:55.083
Don't think with your dick next time.
You're going to keep quiet.

42:55.166 --> 42:58.208
Even if she catches you naked in bed
with another woman,

42:59.125 --> 43:01.375
tell her she's hallucinating.

43:01.875 --> 43:03.375
Keep your mouth shut.

43:04.125 --> 43:05.125
Hey, look at me.

43:06.541 --> 43:08.083
Because once you confess,

43:08.166 --> 43:11.583
that's written in stone,
it's like confessing to the police.

43:12.208 --> 43:13.916
And then, my friend,

43:15.541 --> 43:17.291
there's no way to fix things.

43:30.291 --> 43:31.166
The baby.

43:39.958 --> 43:40.791
Honey.

44:02.166 --> 44:03.125
Sergio.

44:10.083 --> 44:12.333
-What are you doing?
-I found a cell phone.

44:12.416 --> 44:14.208
It's charging. It's at two bars.

44:14.875 --> 44:17.083
It's a little old, but it'll work.

44:27.500 --> 44:29.750
INCOMING CALL

44:44.041 --> 44:45.125
Hello?

44:46.375 --> 44:48.833
-Who are you?
-I'm Shakir.

44:48.916 --> 44:51.958
-I support the Professor from Asia.
-Holy moly.

44:52.583 --> 44:53.750
I'm Benjamín.

44:53.833 --> 44:54.958
I'll put you through.

44:55.041 --> 44:55.958
Yes, of course.

45:02.083 --> 45:03.458
-Professor.
-Listen.

45:03.541 --> 45:05.833
We're out of time. Call the Serbians.

45:05.916 --> 45:07.041
They're here.

45:07.625 --> 45:11.000
I made them come
to guard the outer perimeter.

45:11.083 --> 45:12.916
That's great, Benjamín.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.583
You put me in charge.
I'm taking things as they come.

45:15.666 --> 45:16.916
I'm doing the best I can.

45:17.625 --> 45:20.125
In that case, you have a mission now.

45:24.916 --> 45:26.166
Marseille, let's go.

45:26.750 --> 45:29.041
We have a mission. Tell the Serbians.

45:29.125 --> 45:31.083
Boris, with us. Get the circular saws,

45:31.166 --> 45:34.875
the thermal lances,
the welding machine, mops, and a few guns.

45:36.458 --> 45:40.666
And the rest of you, keep making ingots
like there's no tomorrow!

45:40.750 --> 45:42.458
Let's go!

46:04.291 --> 46:05.541
Get out, and get changed.

46:35.750 --> 46:38.541
Deep down,
Berlin and the Professor were a lot alike.

46:38.625 --> 46:41.875
They both designed plans
based on one powerful concept…

46:44.083 --> 46:44.916
Thrill.

46:45.000 --> 46:45.833
Stop right there.

46:45.916 --> 46:49.166
For the Professor, "thrill" meant
disguising the extraordinary

46:49.250 --> 46:51.291
as something completely ordinary.

46:52.625 --> 46:54.000
A garbage truck.

46:58.541 --> 47:02.250
For Berlin, "thrill" meant
believing the impossible was possible.

47:03.041 --> 47:04.750
And although he didn't think so,

47:04.833 --> 47:07.250
in that way,
the Professor was like his brother.

47:05.750 --> 47:07.708
even though he didn't think so.

47:07.791 --> 47:10.333
Because only with that childlike fantasy

47:07.791 --> 47:10.333
Because only with childlike wonder

47:10.416 --> 47:13.875
can someone play hide-and-seek
on a street besieged by soldiers.

47:11.041 --> 47:13.875
can one play hide-and-seek
on a street guarded by soldiers.

47:13.958 --> 47:17.958
A garbage truck is asking for permission
to enter at control point 1-2-6.

47:21.958 --> 47:26.291
Berlin's Peter Pan pride radiated
over the most important escape of all…

47:21.958 --> 47:24.583
That attempt to escape
the most important one ever

47:24.666 --> 47:27.000
was something Berlin
and Peter Pan would love.

47:26.875 --> 47:27.791
Crossing clear.

47:27.083 --> 47:28.125
We're all clear here.

47:27.875 --> 47:31.166
…an all-or-nothing gamble
in a magical moment.

47:28.208 --> 47:31.666
It was all-or-nothing and it would be
defined in a magical moment.

47:32.375 --> 47:36.000
Like when they discovered
the heist was technically possible.

47:32.375 --> 47:36.000
Just like when they discovered
the heist was technically possible.

47:36.541 --> 47:40.333
It was as if they knew how to get to Mars,
but not how to return.

47:36.541 --> 47:40.333
It was like knowing how to get to Mars,
but not how to come back.

47:41.625 --> 47:44.666
Still, that didn't stop them from
celebrating with enthusiasm

47:42.000 --> 47:45.583
But they celebrated enthusiastically,
as only children can.

47:44.750 --> 47:46.166
that only children have.

48:03.458 --> 48:05.166
One, two, three…

48:05.750 --> 48:06.875
hide-and-seek.

48:05.750 --> 48:06.875
ready or not, here I come.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.583
That's how it happened.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.583
That's how it all happened.

48:09.666 --> 48:11.750
In an instant of complete normalcy.

48:09.666 --> 48:11.750
In an instant of crass normalcy.

48:14.833 --> 48:17.333
The truck swallowed the garbage.

48:14.833 --> 48:17.333
The garbage truck swallowing the trash.

48:17.958 --> 48:20.041
But there was a lot more to it than that.

48:18.416 --> 48:20.041
But it was much more than that.

48:22.666 --> 48:23.500
Professor.

48:23.583 --> 48:27.000
It was putting the heist's brain
back in charge of the game,

48:23.583 --> 48:27.000
It was putting the mastermind behind
the heist back where he belonged,

48:27.500 --> 48:29.375
with a new brain by his side.

48:27.500 --> 48:29.375
with a new mind by his side.

48:29.458 --> 48:31.000
And most importantly…

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
And more importantly…

48:35.625 --> 48:36.916
…the Professor realized

48:35.625 --> 48:40.416
the Professor realized
that his brother's enthusiasm for the plan

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
the enthusiasm for the heist
his brother had infected him with

48:40.500 --> 48:43.041
had now infected his entire team.

48:44.083 --> 48:48.416
That while he had been in technical KO,
lying on the canvas…

48:48.500 --> 48:49.958
You'll see, Professor.

48:50.041 --> 48:53.208
-We did the best we could.
-That's good.

48:50.041 --> 48:52.333
We did the best we could.

48:52.416 --> 48:53.291
That's good.

48:53.291 --> 48:55.291
…the machinery had kept running.

48:53.375 --> 48:55.583
…the machinery had kept running.

48:56.791 --> 48:58.333
The gold was outside,

48:56.791 --> 48:58.333
The gold was out

48:59.166 --> 49:02.000
and the exterior foundry
was in full swing.

48:59.166 --> 49:02.000
and the stormwater tank foundry
was in full swing.

49:03.583 --> 49:05.875
The dream was more alive than ever.

49:29.916 --> 49:30.750
They did it.

49:39.916 --> 49:40.958
They did it.

49:41.958 --> 49:43.791
Palermo, they did it.

49:41.958 --> 49:43.791
Palermo, you did it.

49:44.291 --> 49:46.791
There's a foundry in the stormwater tank.

49:47.291 --> 49:49.500
Of course it's out, brother!

49:47.291 --> 49:49.500
Of course there is, brother!

49:49.583 --> 49:51.958
Isn't it the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

49:52.041 --> 49:53.416
The gold is coming out.

50:01.583 --> 50:03.000
The gold is coming out!

50:07.833 --> 50:09.208
This one's for you, Andrés.

50:09.291 --> 50:13.125
With a pump this powerful,
they'll hear the suction or the pumping.

50:09.291 --> 50:12.416
With a pump this powerful,
they'll hear the sound of the suction,

50:12.500 --> 50:15.833
or pumping, it'll be very easy to assume
we're passing it through the plumbing.

50:13.208 --> 50:16.416
It'll be easy for them
to figure out we're using the pipes.

50:19.458 --> 50:21.250
Why won't they be waiting for us?

50:19.458 --> 50:21.250
Why wouldn't the police be waiting?

50:21.833 --> 50:26.041
That's an excellent question, Sergio,
but we do have the answer.

50:21.833 --> 50:26.041
That's an excellent question, Sergio,
and we've got the answer to that.

50:26.125 --> 50:29.333
And the answer is the difference
between a white-collar thief

50:26.125 --> 50:29.333
And the answer is the difference
between a cat burglar

50:29.416 --> 50:30.708
and us.

50:30.791 --> 50:33.541
The difference between
being good and being a genius.

50:33.625 --> 50:35.875
And we aspire to genius.

50:33.625 --> 50:35.291
-And we only aspire…
-…to pure genius.

52:05.416 --> 52:08.833
Subtitle translation by: Molly Yurick
7:03,041 --> 00:47:05,666
The Professor was like
his brother in that sense,
