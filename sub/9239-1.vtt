00:08.080 --> 00:11.360
PAT: Welcome, adventurers!
Welcome, one and all.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.840
For those of you
just joining us, I'm Pat Numbar,

00:14.280 --> 00:15.840
proud creator and benefactor

00:15.920 --> 00:22.800
of the 2054 search
for the Extreme Teen Supreme!

00:24.080 --> 00:27.400
After two days of fun-filled
warm-up festivities
here on Earth

00:27.480 --> 00:29.400
we'll be rocketing off
to the main event...

00:30.040 --> 00:31.160
on the moon!

00:34.840 --> 00:36.640
To me, it is so believable minor

00:36.760 --> 00:39.400
that something this gigundous
could happen without Zenon.

00:40.320 --> 00:43.080
Hello! Margie,
isn't it crushing?

00:43.160 --> 00:45.520
Yeah. Of course it is, Cassie.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.840
Especially if by "crushing,"
you mean fully fabulo!

00:50.440 --> 00:52.760
Margie, we love Zenon, remember?

00:52.840 --> 00:56.240
I know, but I can't pretend
to be pancaked
about finally getting a chance

00:56.320 --> 00:59.000
to compete without her for once.
She wins everything.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.640
Yeah, well, if she does,
it's because she way
deserves it.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.680
Zenon, is it called
parallel parking

01:29.760 --> 01:30.800
or parallel smashing?

01:40.640 --> 01:43.160
If you don't get this right,
I can't pass you.

01:44.320 --> 01:45.840
But if I don't get
my pod license,

01:46.280 --> 01:47.720
I can't join the contest!

01:47.800 --> 01:49.200
Well, it's not my fault
you wait until the last

01:49.280 --> 01:51.280
-possible instant
to take the test.
-Yeah, but...

01:51.360 --> 01:55.040
Really, Zenon, I think
it's about time you acted
a little more like an adult.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.440
That's not fair. If I start
becoming all grown-uppy,

01:57.520 --> 02:00.480
I'm gonna be boring
to the tenth power squared.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.360
PLANK: We're piloting.
It's a very serious business,
Zenon.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.480
You're not exactly helping,
you know? (GROANS)

02:26.840 --> 02:29.920
-Up, Zenon. Pull up.
-I'm trying, Commander!

02:32.720 --> 02:34.240
Well, add power.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.880
It's fully not responding.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.200
-PLANK: Zenon!
-(ZENON GROANS)

02:39.280 --> 02:40.800
(ALARM BLARING)

02:41.840 --> 02:44.160
-What can I do, Commander?
-What can either of us do?

02:44.240 --> 02:46.560
This ship is totally
out of control.

02:48.920 --> 02:54.840
-(ALARM BLARING)
-(ZENON SCREAMS)

03:00.000 --> 03:02.600
-Well done.
-Commander Plank!

03:02.680 --> 03:05.240
Stay calm. Maneuver around it,
Zenon. You can do this.

03:07.840 --> 03:10.240
(ZENON SCREAMS)

03:15.280 --> 03:18.320
Great job. Amazing job.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.720
I honestly wasn't sure
you had it in you.

03:21.240 --> 03:24.080
Trust me, sir,
that makes two of us.

03:51.720 --> 03:53.720
You took us to Earth?

03:54.600 --> 03:56.720
Isn't it lunarious?
We fished our wish.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.560
How do you manage it, Zenon?

03:59.080 --> 04:01.480
I guess it's just
what I do, sir.

04:01.560 --> 04:04.120
ROBOT: <i>You have scored 48</i>

-Hey, Zee!

04:24.640 --> 04:27.120
Now that you got your license,
are you gonna pod-hop down here
to see me?

04:27.600 --> 04:31.200
Vega-omega, how are you?
Is your semester in Maui
still stellar?

04:31.680 --> 04:34.280
Perfect weather every day.
How could it not be?

04:34.360 --> 04:36.440
<i>You have no idea how much</i>
<i>I've been missing you.</i>

04:37.120 --> 04:39.240
Isn't it totally viral
being apart?

04:39.320 --> 04:42.600
But I hear that cousin Cassie
and you are hanging like a pair
of earrings.

04:42.680 --> 04:43.920
She's the best,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.480
-next to you, of course.
<i>-Hey, do me a favor.</i>

04:46.560 --> 04:48.000
<i>Keep an eye on her</i>
<i>during the race to the moon,</i>

04:48.480 --> 04:52.200

as well-traveled as you are.

04:52.280 --> 04:54.080
<i>You're gonna watch it</i>
<i>on the flat screen, right?</i>

04:54.160 --> 04:56.880
Only every nanosecond.
Are you gonna see Cassie soon?

04:56.960 --> 04:58.200
-Sooner than soon.
<i>-Fabulo.</i>

04:58.640 --> 05:01.680
<i>-Tell her I said hi, will you?</i>
-The nanosecond I see her. Bye!

05:01.760 --> 05:05.400
Bye, Zee! I gotta go back
to a hard life of sand and surf.

to present to you
our six amazing...

-Whoa. Nice picture.
-Isn't it the inkiest?

05:23.840 --> 05:27.200
-I am so glad you're here.
-Yeah, me too.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.480
I can tell.

05:30.680 --> 05:33.120
Well, luckily, Cassie and I have
had mondo time

05:33.200 --> 05:34.960
to get glam fabulous.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.840
It's too bad you'll
have to appear looking like...

05:37.560 --> 05:40.480
-that.
-What's wrong with how I look?

05:40.560 --> 05:41.560
Nothing!

PAT: From the Mullineux
space station,

05:45.360 --> 05:47.360
welcome Bronley Hale!

05:50.840 --> 05:54.520
Forget making him a contestant.
He should so be the grand prize.

the moon!

Please join us
the day after tomorrow

06:24.960 --> 06:27.160
tor the very first round
of our competition,

06:27.280 --> 06:30.360
the thrilling Run to Moonstock!

06:33.120 --> 06:35.920
Be sure to join us tonight
for our kickoff beach party,

06:36.000 --> 06:39.360
celebrating the glory
of the moon goddess Selena.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.600
Hey, excuse me.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.560
Can I talk to you a minute?
You're Zenon Kar, right?

06:43.640 --> 06:45.160
Sage Borealis.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.880
So, you're not a huge fan
of this contest?

06:47.960 --> 06:49.840
My friends and I think
it's wrong to go to the moon.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.480
Your friends?

06:55.320 --> 06:56.320
I think it's wrong.

06:57.840 --> 07:00.000
Look, I'm sure
that you're sincere extreme

07:00.080 --> 07:02.280
and really believe
in your cause, which is great,

07:02.960 --> 07:05.520

Good luck to you. See you!

07:19.200 --> 07:20.400
we've thought
about having kids,

07:20.480 --> 07:22.640
and we've talked about
having kids, and we...

07:22.720 --> 07:25.560
Vega-omega!
You're having a baby!

07:25.640 --> 07:27.000
Oh, well, um,

07:27.080 --> 07:29.880
actually, the baby's
already been had.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.360
What? When?

07:31.440 --> 07:34.160
-Oh, no, no! I didn't. No,
it's not, no...
-Shh.

07:36.240 --> 07:38.320
Well, Zee, we're not exactly
spring chickens

07:38.400 --> 07:40.000
as the saying goes. (CHUCKLES)

07:40.480 --> 07:43.760
So, we decided to take
in a foster child.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.600
Right. Nothing's permanent yet.
It's still on a trial basis.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.680
Right now, we're working
to prove to the bureaucrats

07:48.760 --> 07:50.840
that if they want loving,
terrific parents,

07:50.920 --> 07:52.480
look no further than the Planks.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.640
Well, have you met the kid?
Is he great?

07:55.120 --> 07:56.680
-Her.
-Oh.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.280
It's a girl?

Stellar. How old is she?

08:00.640 --> 08:03.920
Ten. And she's wonderful!

to eavesdrop! I swear I wasn't!

08:14.640 --> 08:18.160

to your new cousin, Dasha.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.640

in a mini mirror!

This is so lunarious!

I can't believe my hero major
is fully gonna be related to me!

08:40.080 --> 08:42.960
Now, Pat, we've had a flood
of calls about the pod race.

08:43.040 --> 08:44.040
Tell us about that.

08:44.640 --> 08:46.680

08:46.760 --> 08:50.200
<i>I used to be something</i>
<i>of a pod racer myself.</i>
<i>In my youth.</i>

08:50.280 --> 08:52.280
So, how come Numbar

08:52.360 --> 08:54.440
only opened up this contest
to space station kids?

08:56.040 --> 08:57.680
I'm not sure
but we could ask him.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.360
-Let me do it, okay?
-Go, go.

could enter the contest

<i>Well, Dasha,</i>
<i>the answer's fairly simple.</i>

09:20.200 --> 09:22.400
Did you hear that?
He talked to me.

he's the luge hover boarder

in the west teen Olympics.

saved his sixth-grade class?

10:21.960 --> 10:24.000
Yup. The shuttle pilot
passed out,

10:24.080 --> 10:26.760
and the amazing Bronley
flew everyone to safety,

done it before.

into its space trainee program.

-Why don't you try one of them?
-I would...

10:57.280 --> 10:59.080

to help get my message out.

-What message?
-That bringing people
to the moon is wrong.

would call that progress.

No. Real human progress would be
knowing when to leave well
enough alone.

covered in tacky lunar condos

12:21.280 --> 12:23.920
-You're trying to psych me out.
-Is it working?

12:24.520 --> 12:25.880
Not even a little bit.

12:26.640 --> 12:29.760
And by the way,
that's my space station.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.200
Yours is somewhere over Europe.

12:40.680 --> 12:42.080
(GROANS)

12:58.520 --> 13:01.320
Zee, what is the problem
over there?

13:01.680 --> 13:03.360
You're wearing me out.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.320
I don't know. I can't sleep.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.840
Well, maybe it's because you're
all macro pumped about

13:10.920 --> 13:12.320
going to the moon.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.320
Yeah.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.480
(SIGHS) The moon.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.000
Wonder what it'll be like.

13:25.080 --> 13:26.440

13:28.000 --> 13:29.560

13:43.160 --> 13:45.760
<i>That's one small step for man...</i>

13:48.080 --> 13:50.720
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

13:54.960 --> 13:55.960
(GASPS)

13:56.480 --> 13:59.760
Whoa! Rocket up and scare me,
why don't you?

13:59.840 --> 14:02.880
-Dasha,
what are you doing there?
-Waiting for you to wake up.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.440
Do you wanna see the faces
you were making?

14:04.520 --> 14:05.840
They were hilarious.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.320
(PANTS)

14:08.880 --> 14:11.000
A fully unnerving way
to start the day.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.320
DASHA: This one I downloaded
from a video chip

14:20.400 --> 14:22.640
and printed on a scan zap.
Isn't it stellar?

14:22.720 --> 14:24.360
ZENON: Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.920
Is that really
a lock of my hair?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.320
I contacted the space stay
hairdresser's kid

14:29.400 --> 14:31.800
and had her z-mail it to me.
Ingenious major, no?

14:32.640 --> 14:34.800
Okay, now you're really starting
to freak me out.

14:35.160 --> 14:37.280
Don't worry. I fully told her
to wait until

14:37.360 --> 14:38.640
it was off your head.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.640
I have an idea.
Why don't we forget about me

14:41.720 --> 14:43.120
and talk about you?

14:43.200 --> 14:45.680
Well, my life's been nothing
but one foster home

14:45.760 --> 14:47.080
after another.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.840
I mean, I've met plenty
of decent people, I guess.

14:50.320 --> 14:54.320
It's just that somehow none of
them have actually clicked...

14:55.160 --> 14:56.160
until now.

14:56.720 --> 14:59.840
I can mega tell I've finally
found my perfect family.

15:00.560 --> 15:03.280
FEMALE VOICE:<i> Dasha,</i>
<i>time for summer school!</i>

15:03.360 --> 15:04.800
(SIGHS) That's the inky price
I pay

15:04.880 --> 15:06.640
for attention-paying minor
all year.

15:14.360 --> 15:15.520
FEMALE VOICE: <i>So,</i>
<i>what do think?</i>

15:15.640 --> 15:17.160
<i>She's pretty adorable,</i>
<i>isn't she?</i>

15:18.160 --> 15:19.280
She's great.

15:23.640 --> 15:26.440
It would just be nice
if she had one little minute

15:26.520 --> 15:28.480
when she wasn't trying to be me.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.360
I know.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.600
And I'm working with her on it,
I promise.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.000
The trouble is
she's been moved around so much

15:36.080 --> 15:37.280
that I think her only constant

15:37.360 --> 15:39.680
has been looking up to you
as her role model.

15:40.120 --> 15:41.080
Lucky me.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.560
Honey, look on the bright side.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.160
By tomorrow night,
you'll be up on the moon,

15:46.240 --> 15:48.800
and Dasha will be stuck down
here with us. (LAUGHS)

15:49.440 --> 15:51.040
Aw. Hey...

15:52.280 --> 15:56.760
It's pretty tough being
somebody's idol, huh? (LAUGHS)

15:57.800 --> 15:59.800
Oh, so, now you know how
Proto Zoa must feel

16:00.320 --> 16:01.880
every day of the year.

16:01.960 --> 16:05.160
<i>♪ Wake me up, shake me up</i>
<i>Race me to the stars</i>

16:05.240 --> 16:08.600

<i>♪ The galaxy is ours my girl</i>
<i>The galaxy is ours... ♪</i>

16:15.200 --> 16:18.720
Who in the galaxy could possibly

16:19.160 --> 16:21.520
-LESTER: <i>Say again?</i>
-Not you, Lester!

16:21.600 --> 16:22.760
I'm talking about me.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.080
<i>-It's imposs!</i>
-It couldn't be.

16:25.600 --> 16:28.640
Sounds like you need to tune up
the old hearing aid, mate.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.400
<i>-They don't want ya!</i>
-Of course they want me.

16:30.480 --> 16:33.520
Everyone does.
Don't you remember?

16:33.960 --> 16:37.040
-I'm irresistible.
<i>-It's a youth festival.</i>

16:37.120 --> 16:39.760
A youth festival,
shmooth festival!

16:40.400 --> 16:42.600
I've been cutting-edge so long,

16:42.680 --> 16:44.600
they've nicknamed me
"The Knife."

16:44.680 --> 16:46.200
<i>It's just not in the cards,</i>
<i>my friend.</i>

16:46.680 --> 16:48.680
<i>-It's no use.</i>
-Well, call them again.

16:49.480 --> 16:52.960
How can Moonstock possibly
be a happening happening

16:53.040 --> 16:55.840
without the most happening
bloke in the galaxy?

16:56.600 --> 16:59.040
<i>Okay, kid.</i>
<i>Let me give it one more try.</i>

17:02.760 --> 17:04.440
(MUSIC PLAYING)

17:07.760 --> 17:10.160
<i>♪ We never seem to get along</i>

17:10.240 --> 17:12.080
<i>♪ You're always right</i>
<i>I'm never wrong</i>

17:12.560 --> 17:16.840

<i>♪ I say left, you say right</i>
<i>You say day and I say night ♪</i>

17:23.040 --> 17:24.400
When we're home
on the space stay,

17:24.480 --> 17:27.120
I always forget that the best
thing about Earth is the food.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.200
Whoa! Keep going at that rate,

17:29.280 --> 17:31.560
and you'll have enough bones
to build a dinosaur.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.880
Which reminds me,
I have a bone to pick with you.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.160
What did I do now?

17:38.240 --> 17:39.800
Aren't we together enough
in our waking lives

17:39.880 --> 17:41.640
without you invading
my dreams too?

17:42.200 --> 17:44.960
Wait! I had a dream she was
starring in too, last night.

17:46.160 --> 17:49.240
Whatever it was,
it could not have been
as bizarro as my dream.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.480
I was on the moon.

17:51.080 --> 17:54.080
-With old Neil Armstrong?
-How could you know that?

17:54.160 --> 17:56.240
How could I not know it?
It was my dream.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.880
But that's what was happening
in my dream too.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.320
And you didn't even need
a spacesuit.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.080
Wait, wait. This is
way too wiggy.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.920
We cannot have the same dream.

18:06.360 --> 18:08.000
Yet we did.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.960
It is so dark matter.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.400
Downright black hole-ish.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.040
Inky to the tenth power
squared...

18:16.120 --> 18:18.160
-(SCREAMS)
-Hey! Easy!

18:18.600 --> 18:20.240
All I came to do
was ask you to dance.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.040
Bronley, by any chance did you
have a weird dream last night?

18:25.920 --> 18:27.920
No, I don't really see
the point of dreaming.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.760
I'd much rather just be
out there living it.

18:44.560 --> 18:47.560
So, I hear you've led
a pretty macro life.

18:48.040 --> 18:51.120
Big space rescue,
NASA cadet training,

18:51.200 --> 18:54.160
-The Olympics...
-Well, what about you?

18:54.720 --> 18:57.080
Saving your space station
and jetting out to meet aliens.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.040
Cassie said we're two of a kind.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.600
My only trouble's been finding
someone who can keep up with me.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.800
I know the feeling.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.200
It seems like everyone gets way
too caught up

19:10.280 --> 19:11.640
in playing it safe.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.040
Yeah, because they're macro
afraid of getting hurt.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.960
So they never get a chance
to find out

19:16.040 --> 19:17.360
what they might be missing.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.240
Cetus-lupedus!

19:26.320 --> 19:28.320
If you want to kiss him,
just do it already!

19:29.960 --> 19:31.000
Out!

19:32.120 --> 19:33.880
Dasha, what are you
doing here?

19:33.960 --> 19:35.640
I thought I left you at home,
asleep.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.120
You did. Till I realized that
you were out here

19:38.240 --> 19:39.800
having all the fun.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.520
-I'm sorry about this.
-I didn't know you had a sister.

19:42.920 --> 19:46.840
I don't. She's my cousin.
And we have to be going now.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.840
Whoa. Wait a second.
We can't leave yet.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.640
I want to dance!
I want to meet boys!

19:54.400 --> 19:56.320
Okay. Bye.

19:57.160 --> 19:59.040
What if Aunt Judy
and Commander Plank

19:59.120 --> 20:00.480
go in to check on you?
They're gonna be

20:00.560 --> 20:03.320
so worried major,
and you cannot do that to them.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.440
I have to get you home
right now.

20:12.320 --> 20:14.000
-JUDY: Oh...
-PLANK: There you are!

20:15.280 --> 20:16.560
Thanks heavens you're all right!

20:16.640 --> 20:18.880
What were you doing
giving us a scare like that?

20:19.520 --> 20:20.680
Actually, Commander...

20:21.560 --> 20:22.800
it's all my fault.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.440
(CHUCKLES) I should've known.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.280
-Wait. It wasn't...
-Dasha, it's okay.

20:30.120 --> 20:33.760
I'm sorry, guys. I just...
I made a judgment error major.

20:33.840 --> 20:37.480
It's just since I'm heading off
to the moon tomorrow,

20:37.560 --> 20:39.200
Dasha and I wanted to spend
a little

20:39.280 --> 20:41.280
quality time together
before I go.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.920
I fully should have left you
a zap-pad note?

20:45.000 --> 20:47.240
That fully would've made us
a lot less worried,

20:47.320 --> 20:49.160
-considering you...
-But you're home safe now,

20:49.240 --> 20:52.880
so why don't we just head off
to bed and call it a night?

20:52.960 --> 20:54.200
-Sounds good.
-Yeah.

20:54.280 --> 20:56.640
Wait, wait! Zenon.
Dasha. Dasha...

20:56.720 --> 20:58.320
-Leave them alone.
-But we...

20:58.400 --> 21:00.240
They're children, they're tired.
They need their...

21:02.640 --> 21:05.560
You know, I can't believe
that you actually covered

21:05.640 --> 21:06.640
for me like that.

21:07.120 --> 21:09.160
It was so stellar!

21:11.320 --> 21:15.200
Dasha, I did it because I need
you to do something for me

21:15.280 --> 21:16.600
in return.

21:17.640 --> 21:18.800
Okay.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.880
I'm already me,
so you can't be me,

21:22.960 --> 21:24.800
because that job's
already taken,

21:24.880 --> 21:26.280
but what I need you to do
is promise me

21:26.360 --> 21:27.960
that you'll fully try
being yourself.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.880
Did I just say that?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.960
PLANK: You know, I was afraid
we were getting in

21:42.040 --> 21:44.120
over our heads the minute
we took this on.

21:44.960 --> 21:46.560
Few more incidents like tonight,

21:47.000 --> 21:48.880
I'm not sure we're gonna be able
to keep her.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.560
JUDY: Honey, she's young.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.600
We have to give her
a chance to settle down.

21:53.320 --> 21:56.680
PLANK: And what if she doesn't?
What if she's just born wild?

21:56.760 --> 21:58.240
There's nothing
we can do about that.

21:58.760 --> 22:01.040
You're not suggesting
we give her back, are you?

22:01.120 --> 22:04.040
I'm saying we need
to be practical.

22:04.560 --> 22:07.000
No matter how big and brown
her eyes are,

22:07.080 --> 22:09.840
what's the point of keeping her
if she's gonna ruin our lives?

22:10.400 --> 22:11.600
Oh, Edward,

22:12.280 --> 22:14.800
were we ridiculous
to take this all on at once?

22:15.240 --> 22:18.760
I've always wanted a dog.
Yes, I did! Yes, I did!

22:20.040 --> 22:22.600
And Dasha is gonna love her too.

22:23.440 --> 22:26.840
Even if the dog does come
at a rather inconvenient cost.

Aunt Judy, are you almost ready?
We need to get going.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.120
Did you zap-pad
your parents yet?

23:05.200 --> 23:07.080
Yes, I did. And they promised
they'd be watching the race

23:07.160 --> 23:08.600
from the flat screen
in their lab.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.480
Now, careful, Zenon. We just
got back from getting her shots.

23:17.560 --> 23:19.600
Oh, she's for Dasha.
Do you think she'll like her?

23:20.280 --> 23:22.520
Who wouldn't? She's precious.

23:23.400 --> 23:24.560
Where is Dasha, anyway?

23:24.640 --> 23:26.400
We're only gonna have like,
two seconds to say good-bye.

23:26.560 --> 23:28.080
She told me you did all that
when I dropped he

23:28.160 --> 23:29.360
at summer school this morning.

23:30.360 --> 23:33.600
Well, Ms. Kar,
I figure I'm wasting my breath,

23:33.680 --> 23:36.400
But why not see if you can make
it through this lunar adventure

23:36.480 --> 23:39.400
without getting sucked
into a single galactic calamity?

moon dreams I've been having.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000

up there wearing the crown.

37:10.680 --> 37:13.160
Vega-omega, all the kajillion
frantic messages

37:13.240 --> 37:15.320
from you and Aunt Judy
finally got to me this morning,

37:15.400 --> 37:16.720
but I haven't been able
to get through to you.

37:16.800 --> 37:20.160
I've been trying forever.
Dasha's here.

37:20.800 --> 37:23.040
<i>-She's there?</i>
-Well, not here-here

37:23.680 --> 37:27.400
but she's here in the capable
hands of Margie and Cassie.

37:27.480 --> 37:29.600
<i>Oh, thank heaven.</i>
<i>We were worried sick!</i>

37:30.120 --> 37:31.600
She stowed away on my racing pod

37:31.680 --> 37:34.720
because she's fully afraid that
you and Aunt Judy
don't want her.

37:34.800 --> 37:38.120
<i>What? Did you tell her nothing</i>
<i>could be further from the truth?</i>

37:38.200 --> 37:39.480
I tried.

37:39.560 --> 37:42.400
<i>Okay, you know what?</i>
<i>You just tell her to sit tight.</i>

37:42.880 --> 37:44.920
<i>I don't care how dangerous</i>
<i>these weather warps are,</i>

37:45.000 --> 37:46.400
<i>-we're coming to get her.</i>
-But, Commander...

37:46.480 --> 37:48.960
<i>You take good care of her,</i>
<i>Zenon!</i>
<i>Judy and I are on the way.</i>

37:49.040 --> 37:51.040
<i>Tell Dasha</i>

-Proto Zoa!

37:59.640 --> 38:02.400
Oh. stellar! I didn't know
you were on the bill.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.560
Actually, love, I'm not.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.600
That's right. It's me
in the well-toned,

38:07.720 --> 38:08.880
fabulous flesh.

38:08.960 --> 38:10.960
If it's an autograph you want,
step right up.

38:11.360 --> 38:14.120
No need to be shy.
I'm all yours!

38:18.720 --> 38:20.200
Remind me to write
that dear Jamie

38:20.320 --> 38:21.800
a thank-you note.
would you, love?

38:22.400 --> 38:23.800
Can't tell you
how relieved I am

38:23.880 --> 38:26.360
someone's finally come along
to take the pressure off of me.

38:27.320 --> 38:28.880
Well, you're still gonna play
for us, right?

38:30.360 --> 38:31.520
If they'll have me.

38:32.760 --> 38:36.200
Lester has this ridiculous
notion that I'm too old.

38:36.280 --> 38:40.880
Forget him. You are so not old
until you hit, like, 30.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.200
I'm 31.

38:44.360 --> 38:45.520
Oh.

38:46.960 --> 38:49.600
Have I told you how fully fabulo
you're looking?

38:51.440 --> 38:55.160
Has it come to this, Zenon?
Am I truly yesterday's news?

38:55.840 --> 38:57.720
Vega-omega, of course not.

38:58.320 --> 38:59.560
Come with me.

39:00.200 --> 39:02.000
If I don't find a way
to reinvent myself,

39:02.080 --> 39:05.000
I'll be nothing but an old
rocker in an old rocker

39:05.080 --> 39:07.840
on the rock 'n' roll retirement
home front porch.

39:08.280 --> 39:09.760
Hey, isn't that Proto Zoa?

39:12.200 --> 39:13.600
Who's Proto Zoa?

39:14.200 --> 39:15.920
Proto Zoa used to be a star.

39:16.520 --> 39:19.440
ZOA: I was the first rock star
ever to play in outer space.

39:19.520 --> 39:22.560
Yes, well, personally,
Proto Zoa, I love your music.

39:22.640 --> 39:24.800
I have every one of your
disc chips. I do.

39:24.920 --> 39:26.200
Well, of course you do, mate.

39:26.280 --> 39:28.960
But this event is all about
reaching into the future.

39:29.040 --> 39:30.720
Which is why Proto Zoa
couldn't be more

39:30.800 --> 39:33.320
-perfectly perfect for you.
-How do you figure?

39:33.400 --> 39:35.680
Because if it's the world
of tomorrow you're selling,

39:35.760 --> 39:38.200
why not jump ahead of the curve
and present an ultra-hip

I mean it.

this competition is about.

43:53.520 --> 43:55.440
You're brave, handsome, strong.

Fact is, you remind me
quite a bit of myself

your hand again

to be glam-fabulous?

Wait, I thought girls were
supposed to have

45:03.800 --> 45:05.680
evolved past all that.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.880
Look, kid, Just because I'm
macro smart

45:08.960 --> 45:11.040
and mega independent,
that's no reason for me

45:11.120 --> 45:12.560
to bury my beauty.

45:12.640 --> 45:15.640
Um, guys, I know that it's just
down to the three of us

45:15.720 --> 45:17.600
and Bronley, but,
I just wanna say

45:17.680 --> 45:19.040
that no matter what happens,

45:19.120 --> 45:21.440
our friendship will always
be the most important thing.

45:25.720 --> 45:27.200
-Right?
-Of course.

45:27.840 --> 45:28.920
Most definitely.

45:29.840 --> 45:33.080
Good, because we're three sides
of an equilateral triangle.

45:33.520 --> 45:37.520
Excuse me. Any chance that that
triangle might become a square?

45:43.080 --> 45:45.560
Are you ready for action?

45:47.600 --> 45:48.800
All right.

45:49.920 --> 45:51.520

into an early lead

struggling just a bit,

46:06.320 --> 46:08.320
but none of these kids
are showing any signs

46:08.400 --> 46:09.840
of giving up.

46:09.920 --> 46:11.320
Oh, yes.

heating up as Bronley

incredible contestants

remain fiercely competitive.

Uh...

46:29.320 --> 46:32.480
well, it's Bronley and Zenon
out in front,

the Saturn ring.

surge and Zenon and Bronley

still fighting to get back
in to contention.

Trust me, folks,
this isn't over yet.

46:43.560 --> 46:45.000

have a chance to pull ahead,

and fall!

47:14.320 --> 47:17.680
Hold on, Mr. Numbar. I wanna
lodge a formal complaint.

47:18.720 --> 47:20.000
There's no way this race
can count,

47:20.480 --> 47:22.000
because Zenon Kar cheated.

-ZENON: <i>I didn't do anything.</i>
-Look, Zenon, I know what I saw.

Maybe it's because
for the first time in your life,

47:34.960 --> 47:37.680
-you're not a shoo-in slam dunk.
-You can cheat all you want,

47:38.240 --> 47:39.760
but it's still gonna be me
who wins.

47:39.840 --> 47:43.080
Really? Then why are you trying
so hard to get me eliminated?

47:43.920 --> 47:45.760
Kind of stinks to be
unfairly judged, doesn't it?

47:46.160 --> 47:49.280
Enough. If I want your opinion,
I will ask for it.

47:49.840 --> 47:52.720
No one in the audience
saw anything unusual
and lacking tangible proof

47:52.800 --> 47:55.800
of misconduct, I can only accept
the results as they stand.

47:56.480 --> 47:59.240

you've been fine competitors.

Congratulations on making it
this far.

48:02.400 --> 48:05.360
And, you, miss Kar,
I'll be watching you, closely.

48:06.120 --> 48:08.520
I can't imagine how awfully
embarrassing it would be

48:08.600 --> 48:10.400
to be exposed as a cheater

48:10.480 --> 48:12.280

flat screen.

So, what's the deal? Is that how
you've always won everything?

48:30.440 --> 48:31.840
No. I didn't do anything.

48:31.920 --> 48:34.120
Was it the same silver mist
that helped you in the pod race?

48:35.440 --> 48:36.560
I don't know.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.280
Maybe.

48:42.400 --> 48:43.800
Well, then, if you didn't know
what caused it,

48:43.880 --> 48:46.120
why didn't you just speak out
and admit it was there?

48:46.760 --> 48:49.560
Because I don't know what it is
or what it wants from me,

48:50.000 --> 48:51.760
and I don't think it's fair
to disqualify myself

48:51.840 --> 48:53.840
over something I fully
have no control over.

48:53.920 --> 48:56.200
But you're sure okay having
a magical advantage

-over the rest of us.
-Vega-omega, Margie.

48:58.600 --> 49:00.000
What do you want me to do?

49:00.760 --> 49:01.920
Quit.

49:04.640 --> 49:07.440
Cassie, you understand
why I can't do that, right?

49:08.960 --> 49:10.800
Well, actually, no.

49:11.520 --> 49:14.360
Among a zillion other reasons,
winning is what I do.

49:14.440 --> 49:17.920
It's what I've always done.
It's what people expect from me.

49:18.360 --> 49:20.880
Yeah, but we also expect you
to do it fairly, Zee.

49:21.280 --> 49:23.760
And without pancaking
your friends in the process.

49:25.440 --> 49:26.880
Let's go, Cassie.

49:27.360 --> 49:29.080
I think somebody needs
a little time alone

49:29.160 --> 49:30.560
to get her values straight.

49:53.120 --> 49:55.360
(SIGHS) If you think
it's so lunarious being me,

49:55.440 --> 49:56.640
try doing it today.

49:56.760 --> 49:59.160
I have no idea
what's the right thing to do.

49:59.240 --> 50:00.600
Margie and Cassie blame me

50:00.680 --> 50:02.160
for getting them squeezed out
of the contest,

50:02.240 --> 50:04.800
Bronley thinks I'm a cheater,
Sage thinks I'm a sellout,

50:04.880 --> 50:08.120
and on top of all that,
I'm being chased and boosted
by this silver moon mist

50:08.200 --> 50:10.160
everyone's so sure
I can control, but I can't!

50:10.240 --> 50:13.480
Hey! If it helps, I believe you.

50:14.480 --> 50:15.880
About all of it. I mean,

50:15.960 --> 50:19.200
you were right about Wyndham,
you were right about the aliens.

50:19.560 --> 50:21.720
Why would anybody figure
you'd start lying now?

50:22.160 --> 50:23.400
-Good question.
-Come on.

50:26.120 --> 50:28.320
You know what I say?
I say forget about them.

50:28.400 --> 50:29.840
Just do what you told me to do.

50:30.280 --> 50:31.560
Just be yourself
and you'll be fine.

50:33.560 --> 50:34.880
Whoa. Wait a minute.

50:34.960 --> 50:37.680
Did we just have a fable moment
major or what?

50:38.160 --> 50:40.920
It's like right before my eyes,
the student became the teacher.

50:42.800 --> 50:45.120
-I'm gonna go find Sage.
-I'm fully behind you, Zee.

50:45.560 --> 50:48.240
Forget that. I'm much better off
with you fully beside me.

50:48.320 --> 50:49.560
Come
on.

50:50.800 --> 50:52.200
What are we doing here?

50:52.320 --> 50:54.360
Well, I think it's totally
unfair for Numbar

50:54.440 --> 50:57.320
to keep Sage locked up in here,
so I intend to break him out.

50:57.720 --> 50:59.640
And how do you know
the access code?

51:00.080 --> 51:03.040
Dasha, is this me
we're talking about or what?

51:04.360 --> 51:06.840
"Coming soon, the lunar
community of tomorrow."

51:10.480 --> 51:11.920
(GASPS) Zenon.

51:12.400 --> 51:14.960
-Suddenly it all makes sense.
-Glad to hear it.

51:15.040 --> 51:16.720
Now you can tell me
why in the universe

51:16.800 --> 51:19.120
is this moon mist trying to make
me look like a cheater major?

51:19.520 --> 51:20.640
I don't mean that.

51:21.720 --> 51:24.280
-This.
-What is it?

51:25.120 --> 51:26.720
What Moonstock is really about.

51:26.800 --> 51:29.200
A permanent settlement up here,
and we're the beginning of it.

51:29.800 --> 51:31.000
I don't get it.

51:33.560 --> 51:35.040
Numbar's trying
to steal the moon.

51:35.120 --> 51:36.960
Oh, yeah.
He'll declare squatter's rights

51:37.040 --> 51:39.560
because he was the first one
to put down roots up here.

51:39.640 --> 51:40.840
Wait a second.

51:40.920 --> 51:42.920
I thought Neil Armstrong
was first?

51:43.440 --> 51:45.520
Oh, well, he left. Numbar won't.

51:45.600 --> 51:48.840
Wait, wait. Neil Armstrong.
The first lunar landing.

51:48.960 --> 51:50.240
That was around here,
wasn't it?

51:50.320 --> 51:53.040
Not too far away.
The sea of tranquility. Why?

51:53.520 --> 51:57.160
I... I just have
a feeling major that someone
there is trying to reach me.

51:57.240 --> 51:59.160
But you can't go onto the moon.
It isn't safe.

51:59.240 --> 52:01.600
I'll be mondo careful.
Don't worry.

52:03.280 --> 52:04.680
I'll be fine, Sage.

52:04.760 --> 52:06.480
Girl's gotta do
what a girl's gotta do.

52:08.160 --> 52:09.240
Stay.

53:44.680 --> 53:47.400
one giant leap for womankind.

53:50.280 --> 53:52.840
Hi. It's me, Zenon.

53:54.200 --> 53:57.720
Look, I don't know who you are
or what you are

53:57.840 --> 54:00.160
or if I'm going .
loony extreme, but...

54:01.080 --> 54:02.800
I've been feeling
as if the moon mist

54:02.880 --> 54:04.400
and I are supposed
to meet here.

54:09.240 --> 54:10.560
So, did I get it right?

54:11.160 --> 54:12.040
Are you here?

54:15.120 --> 54:17.800
If not, I'm gonna feel
ridiculous major

54:17.880 --> 54:20.120
for standing here
and talking to a flagpole.

54:22.120 --> 54:23.200
Hello?

54:25.040 --> 54:26.000
Well, I had to try.

54:26.800 --> 54:28.400
SELENA: <i>Halt right there,</i>
<i>sister.</i>

54:36.280 --> 54:37.760
Hi. Who are you?

54:39.160 --> 54:40.680
Who do you think I am?

54:40.800 --> 54:43.960
Venus? I'm Selena,
Goddess of the moon.

54:45.320 --> 54:48.960
Okay. Well, I thought Selena
was this froufy-looking lady

54:49.040 --> 54:50.960
that Numbar uses on his posters.

54:51.040 --> 54:53.640
Yeah. And how tweaked
do you guess I am about that?

54:53.720 --> 54:55.840
Trying to sell me
to the universe as some Prue

54:55.920 --> 54:57.000
in a peach nightie?

54:57.840 --> 55:00.520
By the way, took you long enough
to figure out I was calling you.

55:01.440 --> 55:03.360
-Sorry.
-I'll get over it.

55:03.880 --> 55:05.760
Oh, look. I'm over it already.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.360
Anyway, word
around the galaxy is,

55:08.880 --> 55:10.480
you're a girl
who can get things done.

55:10.920 --> 55:12.200
What kind of things?

55:12.280 --> 55:15.360
Like getting your fellow
humanoids off of my surface,

55:15.920 --> 55:17.680
so I can get back
to living in peace.

55:18.480 --> 55:21.440
I've been mixing things up
on your home planet,

55:21.920 --> 55:24.240
so everybody'll know
that I mean business.

55:25.360 --> 55:27.680
You're the one responsible
for the weather warps.

55:27.760 --> 55:29.040
Duh!

55:29.120 --> 55:32.200
The point is things are gonna
get a whole lot uglier

55:32.680 --> 55:35.760
unless you convince everybody
to get gone!

55:36.400 --> 55:38.160
Nobody's gonna listen to me.

55:38.240 --> 55:40.760

aren't even speaking to me.

"My best friends
aren't even speaking to me."

55:47.600 --> 55:49.320
Do you really think I care?

55:49.800 --> 55:51.920
It's up to you to get everybody
off of me

55:52.000 --> 55:54.160
before the next Earthset,
or else!

55:56.720 --> 55:58.440
ZENON: What are you doing?

55:58.960 --> 56:00.880
Gravity. Do you dig it?

56:05.200 --> 56:06.240
See?

56:06.600 --> 56:09.480
I can think up all kinds
of fun games to play,

56:09.560 --> 56:13.120
unless you clear out
and clean up my surface

56:13.200 --> 56:15.120
of every last bit of your trash!

56:26.920 --> 56:29.040

56:29.840 --> 56:30.880
Dasha!

56:31.280 --> 56:34.920
How is it possibly possible
that you are here?

56:36.000 --> 56:39.240
Zee, before you launch
into lecture mode major,

56:39.320 --> 56:41.960
remember that we only have
until the next Earthset

56:42.400 --> 56:44.560
to avoid
a master disaster supreme?

56:49.800 --> 56:53.200

I see it. I see Tyco.

56:59.320 --> 57:00.680
We've done it, sweetheart.
The Lunasphere

57:01.200 --> 57:02.640
is right over the horizon.

57:03.360 --> 57:05.960

to land.

57:19.400 --> 57:21.720

are going in circles.

everything's stellar.

What are we gonna do?

57:49.880 --> 57:51.120
Hey!

57:53.440 --> 57:55.280
That must've been going
to the Lunasphere.

57:57.000 --> 57:58.080
This way.

57:59.040 --> 58:00.680
ZENON: Hey! You're getting
pretty good at this.

58:01.200 --> 58:02.360
Wait for me!

58:07.920 --> 58:10.440
What's happening, Eddie? Please,
please, please, please, please,

58:10.520 --> 58:12.360
-don't tell me we're crashing!
-I've never experienced

58:12.440 --> 58:14.480
anything like this
in all my years of flying.

in the grip of some

Sage, what are you doing?

1:00:18.200 --> 1:00:20.280
-I was about to come looking
for you.
-You were?

1:00:20.360 --> 1:00:21.840
Just in time.
We were out of air.

1:00:21.920 --> 1:00:23.760
Yeah, that's why I was coming
to bring you some backup.

1:00:24.320 --> 1:00:26.760
But I thought that you thought
that it was dangerous major

1:00:26.840 --> 1:00:28.280
to go out on the moon.

Hey, a guy's gotta do
what a guy's gotta do.

1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:43.240
I'm sorry I doubted you, Sage.
You were right about everything.

1:00:43.320 --> 1:00:45.560
The moon is so not supposed
to be developed,

1:00:45.640 --> 1:00:47.760
and unless we get everything
off her surface

1:00:47.840 --> 1:00:50.240
before the next Earthset,
we're gonna face
destruction eruption...

1:00:50.320 --> 1:00:53.200
Zenon, what happened?
How do you know all this?

1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:56.200
-Selena told her.
-Selena's in the moon goddess?

1:00:56.280 --> 1:00:59.200
Not her! The real Selena
showed up at the sea
of tranquility.

1:00:59.800 --> 1:01:01.040
She's really mad.

1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:03.960
Look, I know that it sounds
macro crackup, but it's true.

1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:05.360
Fully true.

Before she goes
into meltdown mode,

1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:08.880
we need to get everyone
off the moon.

1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:10.680
Fine with me.

1:01:11.200 --> 1:01:12.560

to believe you.

All I care about is that you're
finally on board

1:01:16.080 --> 1:01:17.360

to do

Now, tell me what you need.

1:01:22.280 --> 1:01:24.200
Well, you could start
by figuring out how much time

1:01:24.280 --> 1:01:27.040
we have until the earth drops
below the lunar horizon.

didn't leave! I am so happy!

that we're talking again?

we're all good again.

I mean, I don't even remember
what popped us apart
in the first place.

1:02:03.840 --> 1:02:08.080
Well, you and Margie thought
that it was wrong for Zenon

1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:10.480
to not quit for getting
a mist boost

1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:12.320
in the Saturn scramble.

1:02:12.400 --> 1:02:14.360
-Thank you, Dasha.
-Who cares about any of it?

1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:16.280
I mean, just as long
as we're best friends again.

1:02:16.800 --> 1:02:18.880
Good, because something inky
extreme's gonna happen

1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:21.000
unless I fully have
all the help I can get.

1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:23.040

we're here.

1:02:38.440 --> 1:02:40.600
Ladies and gentlemen...

1:02:41.720 --> 1:02:43.560
I did get help
from an outside force.

1:02:43.640 --> 1:02:45.960
-I knew it!
-But it wasn't me
who cheated, Bronley!

1:02:46.040 --> 1:02:48.680
It was Selena, the moon goddess.
She was helping me.

1:02:48.760 --> 1:02:51.320
