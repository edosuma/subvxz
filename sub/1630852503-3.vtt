07:56.209 --> 07:58.211
(quietly): Maybe-maybe one
of my implants ruptured?

07:59.212 --> 08:00.613
Those aren't real?

08:00.680 --> 08:03.015
Uh, B-Baldwin and-and I
are new...

08:03.082 --> 08:04.517
{\an5}Dating apps.

08:03.082 --> 08:04.517
(chuckles)

08:04.584 --> 08:06.519
{\an5}No stigma anymore.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.519
{\an5}Mm.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.519
(chuckles)

08:06.586 --> 08:07.787
(grunts softly)

08:07.854 --> 08:09.589
Last night was
our first time together.

08:09.655 --> 08:10.890
{\an4}SAM: Yeah.

08:09.655 --> 08:10.890
{\an1}And it'd been
a while.

08:10.957 --> 08:12.225
{\an5}Things...

08:10.957 --> 08:12.225
Mm-hmm.

08:12.291 --> 08:13.492
Things got a little intense.
(chuckles)

08:13.559 --> 08:14.493
{\an5}Mm-hmm.

08:13.559 --> 08:14.493
Okay. We got it.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.728
{\an5}We'll check it out.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.728
{\an1}Okay.

08:15.795 --> 08:16.929
Oh, and, uh, also, one of--

08:16.996 --> 08:18.164
{\an1}one of my knees
hurts.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.699
{\an1}Next time we'll
stretch out first.

08:19.765 --> 08:21.534
Yeah.

08:21.601 --> 08:23.569
(monitor beeping)

08:23.636 --> 08:24.704
What?

08:26.138 --> 08:28.241
Large inferior Q waves.

08:28.307 --> 08:30.977
{\an3}Tracy, have you ever seen a
doctor for chest pain before?

08:31.043 --> 08:33.913
Yeah. Once, a f-few years ago.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.248
He said it was anxiety.

08:35.313 --> 08:37.082
{\an1}I'm guessing
he didn't do an EKG.

08:37.149 --> 08:40.785
{\an3}This is showing us that you've
had a heart attack before.

08:40.852 --> 08:43.089
How can I have had a heart
attack and not known? (scoffs)

08:43.155 --> 08:46.092
It sounds like you did know but
you weren't diagnosed correctly.

08:46.158 --> 08:47.727
Let's get her a stat echo.

08:47.793 --> 08:49.095
How bad is this?

08:49.161 --> 08:51.530
{\an3}I'm gonna find out
what's going on.

08:54.734 --> 08:55.968
PYNE:
<i>What'd you want to talk about?</i>

08:56.035 --> 08:57.970
In a nutshell, life is easier

08:58.037 --> 09:00.773
{\an3}when my ex-husband and
daughter are not at war.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.008
{\an1}Have you been doing
the breathing techniques

09:02.074 --> 09:03.009
we worked on?

09:03.075 --> 09:05.077
{\an1}Let's do one
together.

09:05.144 --> 09:06.612
{\an4}Come on.

09:05.144 --> 09:06.612
Okay.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.547
{\an6}Okay.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.547
In through the nose.

09:08.614 --> 09:10.216
{\an5}(inhales deeply)

09:08.614 --> 09:10.216
(exhales)

09:10.283 --> 09:11.751
Out through the mouth.

09:11.817 --> 09:13.886
(exhaling)

09:16.188 --> 09:18.591
♪ ♪

09:25.865 --> 09:27.099
Mm.

09:30.369 --> 09:32.939
Mmm. See?

09:33.906 --> 09:35.007
This...

09:35.074 --> 09:36.909
is why I married you.

09:36.976 --> 09:38.911
Okay, I have to go.
Busy day.

09:38.978 --> 09:40.913
Where, hopefully,
I won't run into Griff.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.048
But if I do,

09:42.114 --> 09:43.616
I will breathe.

09:44.383 --> 09:45.785
{\an5}And...

09:44.383 --> 09:45.785
Mm-hmm.

09:45.851 --> 09:47.053
...if that doesn't work,

09:47.119 --> 09:48.220
try boundaries.

09:48.287 --> 09:50.623
Those, I've got.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.630
(exhales)

09:57.697 --> 10:01.834
{\an1}Had a feeling I might
find you out here, Isan.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.970
Bereavement packet?

10:04.036 --> 10:07.173
I have to return the patient's
things to the family.

10:07.239 --> 10:08.908
Have them sign papers.

10:08.975 --> 10:10.276
{\an1}Hmm.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.111
I don't know how to explain
what went wrong.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.013
Didn't Anders already talk
to the family?

10:14.080 --> 10:15.715
Yeah, I mean, for me.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.283
{\an3}I need to go
over it again.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.151
If I made a mistake,
I need to know,

10:19.218 --> 10:20.987
so I can make sure
it never happens again.

10:21.053 --> 10:23.055
Good luck.

10:27.026 --> 10:28.194
Hi.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.830
I have news. And an ask.

10:30.896 --> 10:32.965
{\an5}I scored a Whipple later today.

10:30.896 --> 10:32.965
{\an3}Oh.

10:33.032 --> 10:34.800
{\an1}Dr. Baum requested me
in general surgery

10:34.867 --> 10:37.770
{\an4}after I aced that chole
last week.

10:34.867 --> 10:37.770
{\an3}Hmm.

10:37.837 --> 10:39.772
{\an3}I'm assuming the request
is to study for it?

10:39.839 --> 10:43.042
{\an1}If that's okay. I mean,
I could still be with you.

10:43.109 --> 10:45.311
Mm, yeah. Absolutely.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.113
Tell me how it goes?

10:47.179 --> 10:49.248
{\an1}Yeah, I will. Maybe over
a glass of wine later?

10:49.315 --> 10:52.184
Uh... I'm not there yet.

10:52.251 --> 10:55.187
I'm sorry. I'm trying.

10:55.254 --> 10:56.756
{\an3}And I really appreciate
you pushing me

10:56.822 --> 10:58.124
to fight for this position,

10:58.190 --> 11:00.192
but there's you,
and then there's my dad,

11:00.259 --> 11:03.229
and then there's you
and my dad, and it's...

11:03.295 --> 11:08.167
I really want for things
to get better between us, but...

11:08.234 --> 11:09.835
But?

11:10.903 --> 11:12.938
N-No, no. Butt.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.740
Multiple butts.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.740
Oh.

11:14.807 --> 11:16.042
{\an1}(stammers)

11:16.108 --> 11:17.743
{\an3}Excuse me.

11:17.810 --> 11:19.111
Hello?

11:25.251 --> 11:27.286
{\an1}Oh, uh, I've got to get
to another delivery,

11:27.353 --> 11:29.021
but I set up
the first few for you.

11:29.088 --> 11:30.089
What?

11:30.156 --> 11:32.458
{\an1}Uh...

11:32.525 --> 11:34.126
Do you have any idea
why these were delivered here?

11:34.193 --> 11:37.229
I didn't ask because I
didn't want to butt in.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.698
{\an5}It wasn't funny
the first time.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.698
Okay, sorry.

11:39.765 --> 11:41.067
I-I didn't mean to be cheeky.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.234
Dear God, make it stop.

11:42.301 --> 11:44.170
You're right. No more cracks.

11:44.236 --> 11:45.471
{\an1}I think this is
the packing slip.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.106
{\an1}Thank you.

11:47.173 --> 11:49.942
{\an3}Uh, okay, they're
medical teaching tools,

11:50.009 --> 11:51.944
{\an1}used to hone
prostate exam skills.

11:52.011 --> 11:54.180
{\an3}This is the cardio
department. Why are they...

11:55.247 --> 11:57.149
"Deliver to Dr. Sam Griffith."

11:59.118 --> 12:01.220
{\an1}Huh.

12:01.287 --> 12:04.290
Huh. I don't suppose
you have any idea why

12:04.356 --> 12:05.991
three dozen units

12:06.058 --> 12:07.193
of nonrefundable
prostate equipment

12:07.259 --> 12:08.260
were delivered here to me today?

12:08.327 --> 12:10.029
My understanding is that these

12:10.096 --> 12:12.198
are very advanced
training devices.

12:12.264 --> 12:13.365
{\an1}SAM:
This is a prank,

12:13.432 --> 12:14.867
and a very elaborate one.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.302
So what is this really about?

12:16.368 --> 12:17.770
Well, it's obviously a mistake.

12:17.837 --> 12:19.205
But, well,
it's the kind of thing

12:19.271 --> 12:21.173
that comes across
the chief's desk all the time.

12:22.308 --> 12:24.276
You want me to make some calls?

12:24.343 --> 12:27.179
No. I think you've done enough.

12:28.314 --> 12:32.017
Okay. Well, either way, I win.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.962
I know my dad.
This is more than just a joke.

12:43.028 --> 12:44.930
I mean, is he trying
to distract me?

12:44.997 --> 12:46.465
{\an1}Maybe it's simpler
than that.

12:46.532 --> 12:48.033
Maybe he's just trying
to embarrass me

12:48.100 --> 12:49.034
in front of everyone.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.302
These are medical devices.

12:50.369 --> 12:51.504
And we are all adults.

12:51.570 --> 12:52.872
{\an3}There is nothing
embarrassing here.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.073
{\an5}I...

12:52.938 --> 12:54.073
Dr. Griffith?

12:55.241 --> 12:57.176
Mr. Kingsley.

12:57.243 --> 12:58.544
Hello.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.113
Thank you for taking time
out of your day.

13:01.180 --> 13:02.481
I was looking for my son.

13:02.548 --> 13:04.150
{\an1}Is this...

13:05.217 --> 13:06.285
...the new tech you mentioned?

13:06.352 --> 13:08.154
No. This is a mix-up.

13:08.220 --> 13:10.055
{\an5}A mix-up?

13:08.220 --> 13:10.055
I didn't order these.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.490
I actually think
that my father did...

13:11.557 --> 13:12.958
{\an1}I've always said
a good leader

13:13.025 --> 13:14.360
takes responsibility
for everything

13:14.426 --> 13:15.895
that happens on their watch.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.530
{\an5}I'm about to handle it.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.530
{\an1}Great.

13:17.596 --> 13:19.165
Let's talk when you're done
with that.

13:19.231 --> 13:20.366
Mm-hmm.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.369
Find me when you're free.

13:23.435 --> 13:24.537
Of this.

13:24.603 --> 13:26.005
Yes, sir.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.042
Look, I know.

13:30.109 --> 13:32.845
He's tough, but
he is also fair.

13:32.912 --> 13:35.314
He's open to a conversation.
He-He'll hear you out.

13:35.381 --> 13:38.551
Except that his last memory
of me will be of the time

13:38.617 --> 13:41.120
that I greeted him
from inside a sea of butts.

13:41.187 --> 13:43.389
I have to get these out of here.

13:43.455 --> 13:46.058
How did my dad
even get these in here?

13:49.094 --> 13:50.563
I'm so sorry for your loss.

13:50.629 --> 13:53.032
I don't understand.

13:53.098 --> 13:55.201
People get appendectomies
all the time.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.038
Every surgery carries risk.

13:59.104 --> 14:01.040
The doctor last night said
that Dad hemorrhaged.

14:01.106 --> 14:02.274
He didn't say why.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.876
Do you know?

14:03.943 --> 14:05.844
The reason isn't always clear.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.948
But I'm gonna find one.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.282
{\an3}I promise.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.951
(sniffles, crying)

14:12.985 --> 14:14.386
{\an1}Thank you.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.023
Geez, what's wrong? Am I dying?

14:18.090 --> 14:19.625
We're just concentrating.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.060
It's probably nothing, Tracy.

14:21.126 --> 14:22.394
{\an3}They're just being
extra careful.

14:22.461 --> 14:24.363
Stop right there.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.131
Multiple wall motion
abnormalities.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.367
Is that bad? That sounds bad.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.269
Dr. Trulie, schedule a cath lab

14:30.336 --> 14:32.071
and tag Joey in
so you can study.

14:32.137 --> 14:33.339
{\an1}Thank you.

14:34.673 --> 14:36.275
So, the echo is telling us

14:36.342 --> 14:38.143
{\an3}that you didn't just
have one heart attack.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.311
You've had many.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.113
{\an1}SAM:
Tracy,

14:41.180 --> 14:44.483
you might have felt pressure
in your chest or your arms.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.252
Maybe you felt
tired or dizzy.

14:46.318 --> 14:47.419
Panic attacks.

14:47.486 --> 14:49.021
Cardiac events.

14:49.088 --> 14:51.090
{\an5}Okay. Yeah.

14:49.088 --> 14:51.090
{\an1}The symptoms were
mild enough

14:51.156 --> 14:53.125
{\an5}to be mistaken for-- Oh.

14:51.156 --> 14:53.125
No. Mm-mm.

14:53.192 --> 14:54.426
Okay, hey.

14:54.493 --> 14:56.028
{\an5}Tracy, Tracy, Tracy.

14:54.493 --> 14:56.028
Tracy, try to calm down.

14:56.095 --> 14:58.530
{\an3}Whoa, oh. Sick people
have heart attacks.

14:58.597 --> 15:00.599
Old people have heart attacks.

15:00.666 --> 15:04.503
No one in my family
has ever had a heart attack.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.573
{\an3}Tracy.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.573
(gasps, shouts)

15:07.640 --> 15:09.341
{\an4}Tracy.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.341
Go prep the cath lab.
I got her.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.044
Tracy. Tracy?

15:12.111 --> 15:17.416
There's my son, working so hard,
he forgets to find me.

15:17.483 --> 15:18.584
Or eat lunch.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.219
{\an1}I'm sorry.

15:20.286 --> 15:22.321
{\an5}The boss is in town.

15:20.286 --> 15:22.321
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

15:22.388 --> 15:23.656
Heard he was a hard-ass.

15:23.722 --> 15:25.658
{\an1}Only if he sees you
making a mistake.

15:25.724 --> 15:27.993
Ooh, that is a record.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.229
I haven't even opened
my sandwich yet.

15:30.296 --> 15:32.064
{\an1}I saw you

15:32.131 --> 15:34.566
seem to have a personal
relationship with Sam Griffith.

15:34.633 --> 15:36.502
I do.

15:36.568 --> 15:40.572
It-- I mean, it's...
it's new, but, uh, yeah.

15:40.639 --> 15:42.207
(laughs softly)

15:44.209 --> 15:46.679
I'm not trying to interfere
in that part of your life,

15:46.745 --> 15:49.048
{\an1}but we came up with
a plan for your career:

15:49.114 --> 15:50.649
you climb till you succeed me.

15:52.017 --> 15:53.585
Well, that will
be a weird day.

15:53.652 --> 15:55.554
That'll be a great day.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.256
And I don't want you
getting distracted

15:57.323 --> 15:58.524
or derailed on the way there.

16:00.492 --> 16:02.461
Do you not like Sam?

16:02.528 --> 16:05.698
I don't like her pulling you
into her family power struggle.

16:05.764 --> 16:08.634
No, that... that's not
what she's doing.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.302
Are you sure?

16:10.369 --> 16:12.171
You led her straight to me
at the donor event.

16:12.237 --> 16:13.539
And this morning

16:13.605 --> 16:15.441
I found you right
in the middle of her mess.

16:17.209 --> 16:18.977
Just looking out for you, son.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.554
Worst Netflix and chill ever.

16:28.620 --> 16:32.391
Doesn't matter how many times
I see it, how much I slow down

16:32.458 --> 16:34.393
or freeze,
I can't tell what went wrong.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.628
Well, you can't
control everything.

16:36.695 --> 16:39.198
{\an1}Yeah, "leave it up to the
universe, I can't control it"?

16:39.264 --> 16:42.034
{\an1}That's how guys like you get by
with no accountability.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.237
{\an3}Oh, why stop talking
on my account?

16:45.304 --> 16:47.239
Go on, get it out of your
systems. "Lex and Griff,"

16:47.306 --> 16:49.274
{\an5}"Griff and Lex."

16:47.306 --> 16:49.274
We weren't talking about you.

16:49.341 --> 16:52.111
Sorry. It's just,
everyone else is.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.245
Oh, no, don't get
me wrong, we did,

16:53.312 --> 16:54.513
{\an1}when it first
came out,

16:54.580 --> 16:56.014
but we're over it.

16:56.081 --> 16:57.683
{\an3}I mean...

16:57.750 --> 16:59.351
{\an3}20 people have probably slept
with each other around here

16:59.418 --> 17:00.786
since your news came out.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.421
This isn't helping.

17:02.488 --> 17:05.156
I'm asking the family
to approve an autopsy.

17:06.724 --> 17:08.761
{\an5}JOEY:
Did you rule out
a burst implant?

17:08.827 --> 17:12.064
We did, but after we clean out
this vessel blockage,

17:12.131 --> 17:14.098
we'll have a conversation
with her plastic surgeon.

17:14.165 --> 17:15.666
Who is it? Is it her?

17:17.102 --> 17:18.737
{\an1}Please tell me
so I can prepare.

17:18.804 --> 17:20.339
{\an1}Nobody's getting
ahead of me on this one.

17:20.406 --> 17:21.740
Plastics is all me.

17:21.807 --> 17:23.474
{\an6}GRIFF:
Plastics is a
waste of time.

17:23.541 --> 17:26.211
Your fetish for
interdisciplinary medicine

17:26.278 --> 17:28.247
{\an5}is not relevant in this case.

17:26.278 --> 17:28.247
Push the dye.

17:28.313 --> 17:29.581
Is that what this is all about?

17:29.648 --> 17:31.083
You're protesting

17:31.150 --> 17:32.184
my interdisciplinary approach

17:32.251 --> 17:33.786
by littering my surgical lounge

17:33.852 --> 17:35.387
with prostate devices?

17:35.454 --> 17:36.688
{\an3}I have no idea what
you're talking about.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.323
SAM:
I'm sure you don't.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.092
I don't see the blockage yet.

17:40.159 --> 17:41.760
{\an3}Well, there's all kinds of
blockages, aren't there?

17:41.827 --> 17:43.529
{\an3}Stubbornness,
pride, ambition.

17:43.595 --> 17:45.798
{\an5}It takes many forms.

17:43.595 --> 17:45.798
Ugh, give me a break.

17:45.864 --> 17:47.433
The dye is all the way in.

17:49.201 --> 17:51.103
GRIFF:
Her coronary arteries are clear.

17:51.170 --> 17:52.104
{\an1}How did she have
multiple heart attacks

17:52.171 --> 17:53.539
with perfectly clear arteries?

17:53.605 --> 17:55.140
I don't know, but if we can't
see what's wrong,

17:55.207 --> 17:56.308
we can't fix it.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.377
Let's get her to the ICU.

17:58.444 --> 17:59.678
Okay, we know Tracy fainted,
but does she have a history

17:59.745 --> 18:01.780
{\an5}of fainting?

17:59.745 --> 18:01.780
It's not in her charts.

18:01.847 --> 18:03.515
{\an1}Chest pain after sex.
Unclear if they're related.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.384
{\an5}And she had knee pain.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.384
Yeah, that sounds more like

18:05.451 --> 18:06.685
{\an1}the kind of sex,
not the sex itself.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.587
{\an3}Doesn't explain
the heart attacks.

18:08.654 --> 18:10.522
{\an1}Transient spasm
in the large coronary artery?

18:10.589 --> 18:12.124
That's a lot of spasms.

18:12.191 --> 18:13.392
{\an1}Maybe it's coronary
microvascular dysfunction.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.194
JOEY:
Or maybe it's a spontaneous tear

18:15.260 --> 18:17.229
{\an5}in the artery.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.229
RHONDA:
Maybe it was Professor Plum

18:17.296 --> 18:19.498
in the library with the wrench.

18:19.565 --> 18:21.300
{\an1}It is her.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.503
{\an1}(groans)

18:24.570 --> 18:26.405
{\an1}Bad enough you had
to call plastics in.

18:26.472 --> 18:27.673
Did you have to call Rhonda?

18:27.739 --> 18:29.208
Zip it, you pompous gasbag.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.643
{\an1}I pulled Dr. Glass in
because she

18:31.710 --> 18:33.111
is the chief of plastics.

18:33.178 --> 18:34.513
{\an3}RHONDA:
I also did all of Tracy's

18:34.580 --> 18:36.648
previous surgeries,
which were impeccable,

18:36.715 --> 18:38.150
{\an3}by the way.

18:38.217 --> 18:40.219
Dr. Glass, uh,
my name is Joey Costa.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.687
May I just say,
I'm such a fan of your work.

18:41.753 --> 18:43.655
{\an3}Are you gonna tell me
what's going on here, Jerry?

18:43.722 --> 18:47.226
Um... y-yes.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.627
The patient has
no family history

18:48.694 --> 18:49.761
{\an1}of cardiac events,
yet she's been having trouble...

18:49.828 --> 18:52.297
{\an5}Long pedal on the right.

18:49.828 --> 18:52.297
{\an1}I'm sorry?

18:52.364 --> 18:53.832
Speed it up. I'm familiar
with her backstory.

18:53.899 --> 18:55.801
Down to where she lost
her virginity

18:55.868 --> 18:57.436
and when she smoked
her first cigarette.

18:57.503 --> 18:59.371
The former--
behind a Walgreens in Dearborn,

18:59.438 --> 19:00.739
the latter--
Bowie's Glass Spider Tour.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.375
{\an3}The woman
is a talker.

19:03.442 --> 19:04.743
(laughs):
Oh, coming from you...

19:04.810 --> 19:06.311
I started at Lakeshore

19:06.378 --> 19:07.646
a glorious five weeks

19:07.713 --> 19:09.715
before his overbearing ass
appeared.

19:09.781 --> 19:12.484
He resents my seniority.
Always has.

19:12.551 --> 19:14.920
{\an1}1987.

19:12.551 --> 19:14.920
{\an3}Hmm?

19:14.987 --> 19:18.390
Bowie's Glass Spider Tour
was in 1987.

19:18.457 --> 19:19.892
{\an1}Right.

19:18.457 --> 19:19.892
If Tracy

19:19.958 --> 19:21.426
{\an1}is 40...

19:19.958 --> 19:21.426
Hmm.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.928
{\an1}...she would have only
been six years old then.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.496
She lied about her age.

19:24.563 --> 19:27.266
{\an3}She told you she was 40?
(laughs)

19:27.332 --> 19:28.934
Why would anyone lie
about their age?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.602
Asked no woman, ever.

19:30.669 --> 19:31.770
Do know if she ever found
a boyfriend?

19:31.837 --> 19:33.338
Yeah, online.

19:33.405 --> 19:35.173
There's your answer.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.442
Guys on dating apps, they're
interested in two numbers:

19:37.509 --> 19:38.944
your dress size and your age.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.512
Either of them doesn't meet
with their approval,

19:40.579 --> 19:41.613
they're swiping left.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.915
This changes everything.

19:42.981 --> 19:44.750
We have to run a battery
of new tests.

19:44.816 --> 19:46.919
I mean, Tracy's real age
elevates her risk factors

19:46.985 --> 19:48.654
for multiple conditions.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.756
{\an1}Well, she just made it harder
on herself

19:50.822 --> 19:53.392
by not giving up the game
to start with.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.561
Ah. She's trying
to win at a game

19:55.627 --> 19:57.195
where the odds
are not in her favor.

19:58.964 --> 20:01.233
I, for one, don't blame her.

20:02.734 --> 20:04.503
{\an3}Hey, Sam.

20:02.734 --> 20:04.503
{\an1}Hi.

20:04.570 --> 20:06.672
I did some digging into how
Griff bought those devices.

20:06.738 --> 20:07.706
{\an3}All right, he still
has signing authority

20:07.773 --> 20:08.874
on the Lakeshore account.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.309
{\an1}What? How?

20:10.375 --> 20:12.244
Well, nobody ever revoked it.

20:12.311 --> 20:14.279
{\an4}(stammers)

20:12.311 --> 20:14.279
{\an3}All right, not even after
he fell into his coma.

20:14.346 --> 20:15.914
{\an5}N-No-- Can you revoke it now?

20:14.346 --> 20:15.914
{\an1}Look, Sam,

20:15.981 --> 20:17.649
I like where we are.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.785
I do, too.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.785
{\an1}Good.

20:19.851 --> 20:22.821
It's just, I'm starting to find
my professional footing here.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.257
And-and you and I

20:25.324 --> 20:28.794
working together and dating...
look, it's complicated.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.429
{\an1}(stammers)

20:30.495 --> 20:32.531
No, no, no, I-I'm not
saying I want to stop.

20:32.598 --> 20:35.667
{\an5}Okay? I don't.

20:32.598 --> 20:35.667
Good. Same.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.804
It's just on this one,

20:38.870 --> 20:40.739
I think you need to bring it
to your mom.

20:41.773 --> 20:43.241
Oh.

20:43.308 --> 20:45.811
{\an6}Yeah. Okay.

20:43.308 --> 20:45.811
Yeah.

20:45.877 --> 20:50.415
I will go talk to my mom.

20:56.355 --> 20:57.823
I know, I know. I'm on it.

20:57.889 --> 20:59.691
No more signing authority
for your father.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.360
Why did he even
still have it?

21:01.426 --> 21:03.795
It was an oversight.

21:03.862 --> 21:07.532
I didn't think about revoking it
because he barely ever used it.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.635
{\an3}Well, today he used it to
litter my department's lounge

21:09.701 --> 21:11.036
{\an3}with a bunch of
useless equipment

21:11.103 --> 21:12.604
right when I am
trying to prove

21:12.671 --> 21:14.473
{\an3}that I am a fiscally
responsible department head.

21:14.539 --> 21:15.874
Okay, there. Done.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.342
Listen, when your father and I

21:17.409 --> 21:19.277
were building Lakeshore,
he wasn't part

21:19.344 --> 21:21.446
of the financial equation
beyond donors.

21:21.513 --> 21:22.614
I mean, he would schmooze

21:22.681 --> 21:24.016
{\an1}on the golf course,
that's it.

21:24.082 --> 21:25.384
{\an1}I managed

21:25.450 --> 21:26.785
all his paperwork,

21:26.852 --> 21:29.421
I balanced his books,
I cleaned up his messes.

21:29.488 --> 21:33.492
And that is how CT came to be
the powerhouse it is today.

21:33.558 --> 21:36.962
I know, but now, it's a pow...

21:37.029 --> 21:38.830
Now it is a powerhouse

21:38.897 --> 21:40.832
with a balance sheet
full of butts.

21:40.899 --> 21:41.933
I know.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.435
It's brilliant.

21:43.502 --> 21:45.637
You know, if I say
"My dad did it,"

21:45.704 --> 21:47.673
I look like I can't
control my personnel.

21:47.739 --> 21:49.574
And if I say that I didn't know
about it,

21:49.641 --> 21:51.743
I look like I'm clueless about
my own department's finances.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.578
All right, let's look up
the contract.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.647
Okay. Okay,
we're gonna fix this.

21:55.714 --> 21:58.050
I already have a plan to save
$100K, which is a start.

21:58.116 --> 22:01.453
How much were the devices?

22:01.520 --> 22:02.721
What?

22:03.989 --> 22:06.024
$2 million?!

22:20.539 --> 22:21.640
Well, hello.

22:21.707 --> 22:23.041
{\an3}I thought I was
the only one

22:23.108 --> 22:25.944
who haunted the lab
waiting for test results.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.113
(laughs softly)
I was hoping to talk with you.

22:28.180 --> 22:31.016
Much as I enjoy
my ringside seat

22:31.083 --> 22:33.552
to you and your father's
cage match,

22:33.618 --> 22:35.587
{\an1}you're never gonna
beat him.

22:35.654 --> 22:37.422
Not like this.

22:37.489 --> 22:38.690
What do you mean?

22:40.125 --> 22:43.361
You're gonna have to get
a whole lot dirtier.

22:44.663 --> 22:46.364
I know where the bodies
are buried.

22:47.766 --> 22:49.901
Why would you help me?

22:51.136 --> 22:53.071
'Cause you're the only

22:51.136 --> 22:53.071
Griffith I can stand.

22:54.506 --> 22:56.108
You want my dad
out of the picture.

22:56.174 --> 22:57.142
Don't you?

22:58.744 --> 23:00.846
N-No. I-I'll pass.

23:00.912 --> 23:02.781
This isn't about

23:02.848 --> 23:04.116
digging up dirt,
this is about who's best

23:04.182 --> 23:05.784
to lead the CT department.

23:05.851 --> 23:07.652
Here's your results.

23:07.719 --> 23:08.920
Thank you.

23:11.156 --> 23:12.924
Tracy's estrogen is high.

23:12.991 --> 23:15.393
Especially for someone
in menopause.

23:15.460 --> 23:17.496
Or perimenopausal at least.

23:17.562 --> 23:20.499
She must be taking
hormone replacement therapy.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.434
Which could be prothrombotic.

23:22.501 --> 23:23.869
We've got to get her
off the estrogen

23:23.935 --> 23:25.504
and onto an anticoagulant.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.671
Great.

23:26.738 --> 23:28.440
Nice doing business with you.

23:28.507 --> 23:29.908
{\an5}Mm-hmm.

23:28.507 --> 23:29.908
If you ever want to do

23:29.975 --> 23:34.179
any other business,
you know where to find me.

23:39.885 --> 23:43.021
{\an3}We could just wait
for pathology.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.624
We're here now.

23:45.690 --> 23:47.726
There are other patients
upstairs,

23:47.793 --> 23:49.127
and they're alive.

23:49.194 --> 23:51.429
{\an1}(sighs)

23:57.536 --> 24:00.872
{\an3}Well, it's been a while
since I've done an autopsy.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.841
I'm not as cavalier
as you might think.

24:02.908 --> 24:05.710
If you need to do this
for peace of mind

24:05.777 --> 24:09.714
or pride or whatever, I'll help.

24:15.020 --> 24:18.523
It's not like a patient has
never died on my watch before.

24:18.590 --> 24:21.493
It was Anders,
the way he looked at me.

24:21.560 --> 24:22.828
{\an1}When he called
the time of death...

24:22.894 --> 24:24.029
Well, he was upset.
We were all upset.

24:24.095 --> 24:25.764
It was regret.

24:25.831 --> 24:27.232
{\an5}No, Isan. You're wrong.

24:25.831 --> 24:27.232
{\an1}I'm not.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.668
{\an1}I've seen it in my dad's eyes
my whole life.

24:29.734 --> 24:31.603
He's in family practice;
thought I should be, too.

24:31.670 --> 24:34.239
Not because he wants me
to be his partner;

24:34.306 --> 24:37.676
no, because he doesn't think
I'm good enough to be a surgeon.

24:38.977 --> 24:41.546
So, you have to prove you are.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.656
{\an3}Um... D-Do you want to
pass me the forceps?

24:51.723 --> 24:52.657
What did you find?

24:52.724 --> 24:53.959
No, nothing.

24:56.761 --> 24:58.196
{\an1}What?

25:05.003 --> 25:06.605
I nicked the iliac.

25:08.573 --> 25:11.042
That's why he bled out.

25:11.109 --> 25:12.844
I killed him.

25:14.813 --> 25:15.981
GRIFF:
<i>Isan?</i>

25:16.047 --> 25:17.883
Isan!

25:21.119 --> 25:22.687
{\an3}Do you need something,
Dr. Griffith?

25:23.688 --> 25:24.723
Uh...

25:24.789 --> 25:25.957
Yeah, sure.

25:26.024 --> 25:28.526
{\an1}Uh, so, my golf clubs
are up north.

25:28.593 --> 25:30.128
And I would usually
send Isan to get them,

25:30.195 --> 25:32.597
but he's not answering his texts
and I am playing tomorrow.

25:32.664 --> 25:36.601
Ergo, I am in the market
for a shiny, new set.

25:36.668 --> 25:38.737
Uh...
(groans)

25:38.803 --> 25:41.940
This thing is... keeps
giving me an error message.

25:42.007 --> 25:43.275
It's broken.

25:43.341 --> 25:44.709
It's not broken.
Your payment was declined.

25:44.776 --> 25:46.778
(chuckles)
That's not possible.

25:46.845 --> 25:48.280
It's a Lakeshore card.

25:48.346 --> 25:49.681
Platinum.

25:49.748 --> 25:50.982
It's not working.

25:51.049 --> 25:52.317
Maybe just use a personal card.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.085
That's a great idea.
You have one?

25:54.152 --> 25:55.954
I meant, your personal card.

25:56.021 --> 25:58.990
(laughs): My personal card,
for a business expense.

26:00.025 --> 26:01.226
Funny.

26:03.328 --> 26:05.764
The packing slip says
the devices are nonrefundable

26:05.830 --> 26:08.133
{\an1}and I can't find a loophole
in this contract.

26:08.199 --> 26:09.634
{\an1}Is there anything
on the website?

26:09.701 --> 26:11.136
No, there barely even is one.

26:11.202 --> 26:13.004
{\an3}The company must be new.
There's only a splash page.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.339
Well, what about a phone number?

26:14.406 --> 26:16.074
Yeah, the same one
we've already tried.

26:16.141 --> 26:18.143
Nothing but automated
customer service.

26:18.209 --> 26:19.945
Yeah, I can't tell a recording
that I need

26:20.011 --> 26:21.913
a $2 million refund.

26:25.850 --> 26:27.852
Breathe, and stay calm.

26:27.919 --> 26:30.722
{\an3}It'll defuse the
situation with Griff.

26:30.789 --> 26:32.123
{\an1}Thank you.

26:32.190 --> 26:34.292
{\an3}GRIFF:
Vivian! I need you!

26:34.359 --> 26:37.062
Griffith. You're looking well.

26:37.128 --> 26:40.198
Pyne. You're looking
exactly the same.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.100
I don't know what that means,

26:42.167 --> 26:44.602
but knowing you,
it's probably an insult.

26:44.669 --> 26:47.138
I always forget how your
generation is just so sensitive.

26:47.205 --> 26:50.241
I never forget how yours is not.

26:50.308 --> 26:51.876
(laughs softly)

26:51.943 --> 26:53.611
What is wrong with my Lakeshore
credit card?

26:53.678 --> 26:55.780
{\an1}What a stupid question.
What do you...

26:55.847 --> 26:57.048
(inhales)

26:58.049 --> 27:00.118
It has been revoked.

27:00.185 --> 27:01.753
And I need an explanation

27:01.820 --> 27:03.288
for the $2 million
that you've spent.

27:03.355 --> 27:04.856
Good lesson for Sam.

27:04.923 --> 27:06.758
A lesson? Who orders
a bunch of stupid...

27:06.825 --> 27:08.693
{\an1}(exhales)

27:08.760 --> 27:12.197
Why does he sound like he's
transitioning to active labor?

27:12.263 --> 27:14.165
{\an1}My new husband
has some techniques

27:14.232 --> 27:16.368
{\an1}to help me deal
with my old husband.

27:16.434 --> 27:18.670
Oh, millennial medicine.
That's cute.

27:18.737 --> 27:20.805
I find it helpful.

27:20.872 --> 27:22.240
(whispers): If you don't
want to do the breathing,

27:22.307 --> 27:24.309
{\an5}try boundaries.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.309
VIVIAN: Mm.

27:24.376 --> 27:26.177
Have a serene afternoon.

27:26.244 --> 27:27.779
{\an3}Yeah.

27:27.846 --> 27:29.848
God, you're a fool.

27:29.914 --> 27:32.150
{\an5}Oh...

27:29.914 --> 27:32.150
A shortsighted fool,

27:32.217 --> 27:35.120
because even if you do manage
to get your old job back,

27:35.186 --> 27:37.222
your department's gonna have
a $2 million deficit.

27:37.288 --> 27:39.791
I can make it up on the course.

27:39.858 --> 27:42.894
I've got a plan. Just involves
a new set of golf clubs.

27:42.961 --> 27:45.864
No, you have money.
You buy your own club.

27:45.930 --> 27:47.198
That doesn't make any sense.

27:47.265 --> 27:49.200
They're a legitimate
business expense.

27:49.267 --> 27:51.669
Besides, that limited edition
copper set I bought?

27:51.736 --> 27:53.004
{\an1}What, four grand
with the engraving?

27:53.071 --> 27:54.839
It's seven years ago.

27:54.906 --> 27:56.808
$2 million amortized over time,

27:56.875 --> 27:58.109
that's less than a penny a club.

27:58.176 --> 28:01.913
That is not
what "amortized" means.

28:01.980 --> 28:06.284
{\an3}I want those devices
returned and refunded.

28:08.853 --> 28:09.954
All right, Vivi, I hear you.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.322
I'm not in the business

28:11.389 --> 28:13.691
of making anyone's life
more difficult.

28:15.827 --> 28:17.062
Give this to Sam.

28:17.128 --> 28:18.463
It's the sales rep
that I dealt with.

28:18.530 --> 28:22.100
Th-- What, this is
an actual, live person?

28:22.167 --> 28:24.269
Bit of a dud, but he's alive.

28:24.335 --> 28:26.104
{\an1}He did the deal, I don't know
if he wants to undo it.

28:26.171 --> 28:28.339
Nobody wants to refund
$2 million.

28:28.406 --> 28:30.708
{\an5}We'll see about that.

28:28.406 --> 28:30.708
Thing is, there is a way

28:30.775 --> 28:33.211
{\an1}you could thank me
for giving you his number.

28:33.278 --> 28:35.346
Still with the stupid clubs.

28:35.413 --> 28:37.082
They're actually smart clubs.

28:37.148 --> 28:39.350
{\an5}They compensate for
hooks and slices...

28:37.148 --> 28:39.350
{\an3}Fine.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.454
Get back to work.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.227
Hey.

28:49.294 --> 28:50.728
Ready for the Whipple?

28:50.795 --> 28:52.297
{\an5}Please, don't. No, no, no...

28:50.795 --> 28:52.297
Can I help?

28:52.363 --> 28:54.165
{\an5}Come on. What?

28:52.363 --> 28:54.165
{\an1}(sighs)

28:56.101 --> 28:58.470
(scoffs)
What-- Hey.

28:58.536 --> 29:00.171
It's a conversation.
It doesn't matter.

29:00.238 --> 29:03.408
To you.
You know, it's different for me.

29:03.475 --> 29:05.910
They see me as your mistress
first, doctor second.

29:05.977 --> 29:07.779
That's not true.

29:07.846 --> 29:09.247
You have no idea.

29:09.314 --> 29:10.748
All right?
It was already hard enough

29:10.815 --> 29:12.283
for me to be
taken seriously before.

29:12.350 --> 29:15.153
Now I have to work double
just to get my credibility back.

29:20.358 --> 29:21.292
{\an1}SAM:
Hello, everyone.

29:21.359 --> 29:23.228
{\an4}Thank you.

29:21.359 --> 29:23.228
Hey.

29:23.294 --> 29:25.864
Thanks again for giving me the
time to study for this Whipple.

29:25.930 --> 29:28.833
{\an5}It's a lot.

29:25.930 --> 29:28.833
Mm-hmm.

29:28.900 --> 29:31.302
Look, Sam, this is harder
than I thought.

29:31.369 --> 29:33.338
It's like every time
I'm anywhere near Griff,

29:33.404 --> 29:36.141
all people think about is,
you know, that.

29:36.207 --> 29:38.510
Well, maybe you shouldn't
curl up on a bench with him

29:38.576 --> 29:39.978
and whisper.

29:41.212 --> 29:43.047
Sorry.

29:43.114 --> 29:44.849
I'm still thinking
about it, too.

29:44.916 --> 29:46.851
(pager beeping)

29:46.918 --> 29:48.419
{\an4}GRIFF:
Tracy Reynolds is having
another heart attack.

29:48.486 --> 29:49.921
{\an3}What?

29:49.988 --> 29:52.023
♪ ♪

29:58.930 --> 30:00.298
Push 150 of amio.

30:00.365 --> 30:01.332
Push 70 of roc
and 20 of etomidate.

30:01.399 --> 30:02.834
SAM:
Do it.

30:02.901 --> 30:05.136
7-0 tube to me.

30:06.471 --> 30:07.872
Do you see that?

30:09.307 --> 30:11.209
Look like lesions. Viral?

30:11.276 --> 30:12.544
She's stable for now.

30:12.610 --> 30:14.145
Let's get a sample of this
to the lab ASAP.

30:14.212 --> 30:16.047
{\an3}This might be what's
causing all her problems.

30:17.215 --> 30:18.316
{\an3}CALEB:
Are you gonna be okay?

30:18.383 --> 30:20.285
Isn't your shift over?

30:20.351 --> 30:23.288
I'm fine. You can go.

30:23.354 --> 30:24.455
You don't look fine.

30:24.522 --> 30:26.057
And that makes sense.

30:26.124 --> 30:27.926
{\an3}I mean, it's hard to
look at your mistakes.

30:27.992 --> 30:29.093
Own up to them.

30:30.929 --> 30:34.499
They call it a "fearless and
searching moral inventory."

30:34.566 --> 30:37.202
{\an5}Who calls it that?

30:34.566 --> 30:37.202
People in recovery.

30:37.268 --> 30:39.938
You know, like, accepting
the things you cannot change.

30:40.004 --> 30:41.839
Do you really think
appropriating 12-step mottos

30:41.906 --> 30:43.007
is gonna help me feel better?

30:43.074 --> 30:45.376
It helps me feel better.

30:45.443 --> 30:47.078
What do you mean?

30:48.513 --> 30:50.148
I got sober a couple months ago,

30:50.215 --> 30:52.083
right after Sam
and I broke up.

30:52.150 --> 30:55.987
I made a lot of mistakes.

30:56.054 --> 30:58.556
And now I'm just trying to do
better one day at a time.

31:00.491 --> 31:02.093
I had no idea.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.995
I was good at hiding it.

31:05.463 --> 31:07.865
Nobody knows yet. It's new.

31:07.932 --> 31:09.434
I think if you can

31:09.500 --> 31:11.603
accept that you did
all you could for this patient,

31:11.669 --> 31:13.204
{\an3}it'll be best for the
patients who still need you.

31:13.271 --> 31:14.372
(door opens)

31:14.439 --> 31:15.940
{\an3}MEG:
Prelim path is in.

31:16.007 --> 31:18.009
Your guy had a malignant mass.

31:18.076 --> 31:22.146
It's pretty advanced
appendiceal cancer.

31:22.213 --> 31:23.881
(door closes)

31:23.948 --> 31:25.550
His tissue was falling apart.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.252
That's why the sutures
wouldn't hold.

31:27.318 --> 31:29.053
Well, I still hit the iliac.

31:29.120 --> 31:32.490
Yeah, but if he hadn't had
cancer, you could have fixed it.

31:35.493 --> 31:37.228
I know that you don't
normally permit refunds,

31:37.295 --> 31:39.464
but this is a unique
circumstance. Uh...

31:39.530 --> 31:42.567
I'm not saying that the charge
was fraudulent, I'm just...

31:42.634 --> 31:44.435
"Cause"? Oh, come on.

31:44.502 --> 31:47.405
The cause is that no one needs
this many plastic butts. Bernie.

31:47.472 --> 31:49.674
This is for Tracy Reynolds. Can
you put a rush on those, please?

31:49.741 --> 31:52.143
Sir, I need you to connect me
to your boss.

31:52.210 --> 31:55.280
Sir? Sir?

31:55.346 --> 31:57.315
{\an5}Oh...

31:55.346 --> 31:57.315
DOCTOR: <i> Looks like</i>
<i>it's gonna be a late night.</i>

31:57.382 --> 31:59.284
There's a Whipple
in the OR ahead of me.

31:59.350 --> 32:01.486
DOCTOR 2:
Hope they got a good assist.

32:01.552 --> 32:02.954
Trulie. Which one is that?

32:03.021 --> 32:05.089
The hot one, third year, braids.

32:05.156 --> 32:06.591
Apparently she "assists" Griff.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.226
DOCTOR 2:
Oh, right, the Griff girl.

32:08.293 --> 32:09.227
{\an5}DOCTOR 3:
Explains how she
got the Whipple.

32:09.294 --> 32:10.595
(laughter)

32:10.662 --> 32:12.263
{\an4}Oh, boy.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.263
{\an3}(laughs)

32:12.330 --> 32:14.399
{\an3}Oh, wow.

32:14.465 --> 32:16.334
I know you were
not insinuating

32:16.401 --> 32:18.202
that a tremendously
talented surgeon

32:18.269 --> 32:20.972
got into an operation for
any reason other than her skill.

32:21.039 --> 32:22.707
{\an3}No?

32:22.774 --> 32:25.376
{\an3}If I can get past Dr. Trulie's
recent personal choices,

32:25.443 --> 32:26.678
you certainly can.

32:26.744 --> 32:28.579
And the only thing
you need to think,

32:28.646 --> 32:32.450
let alone say about her is that
she is an incredible doctor.

32:32.517 --> 32:34.452
And if she got
an opportunity

32:34.519 --> 32:36.020
earlier in her career
than any of you,

32:36.087 --> 32:37.722
that is on your lack of skills.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.691
{\an3}Not on her.

32:40.692 --> 32:41.693
Hmm?

32:43.161 --> 32:45.096
(exhales)

32:57.175 --> 32:58.276
JOEY:
<i>Labs got nothing.</i>

32:58.343 --> 33:00.178
It's not a virus.

33:00.244 --> 33:01.612
Dr. Glass,
can you walk us through

33:01.679 --> 33:03.314
all of Tracy's cosmetic
procedures, please?

33:03.381 --> 33:05.450
Mm-hmm. Breast augmentation,
that was the start.

33:05.516 --> 33:07.251
Lower rhytidectomy after that.

33:07.318 --> 33:09.587
Blepharoplasty a year later.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.089
Laser skin resurfacing,
she gets that done fairly often.

33:11.155 --> 33:12.323
Where? Just her face?

33:12.390 --> 33:14.192
Mostly. Few times on her legs.

33:14.258 --> 33:16.527
Varicose vein removals.

33:16.594 --> 33:18.229
How often did you do her veins?

33:18.296 --> 33:20.298
More than most.

33:21.432 --> 33:23.368
It's not Tracy's age.

33:23.434 --> 33:25.269
{\an5}It's a disease.

33:23.434 --> 33:25.269
She was trying to smooth out

33:25.336 --> 33:26.571
{\an1}her skin
but it wasn't age spots.

33:26.637 --> 33:28.706
{\an1}Joint pain.
She said her knees hurt.

33:28.773 --> 33:31.642
Arthritis, headaches,
oral lesions.

33:31.709 --> 33:33.177
{\an1}Superficial
venous thrombosis.

33:33.244 --> 33:35.780
Tracy has Behcet's syndrome.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.548
Blood vessel inflammation
exacerbated

33:37.615 --> 33:38.649
{\an1}by the estrogen
supplements.

33:38.716 --> 33:40.251
{\an1}GRIFF:
None of which you caught

33:40.318 --> 33:42.053
while doing every procedure
under the sun.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.422
Oh, can it. Women get work
like this done every day.

33:44.489 --> 33:47.291
You want me to screen them all
for rare autoimmune disorders?

33:47.358 --> 33:49.060
She's right.

33:49.127 --> 33:50.261
Damn right I'm right.

33:50.328 --> 33:51.496
I didn't invent
beauty standards,

33:51.562 --> 33:54.532
{\an3}even though they do
pay my mortgage.

33:54.599 --> 33:56.601
Standards.

33:56.667 --> 33:58.302
Start her on a gram
of methylprednisolone.

33:58.369 --> 34:00.104
That'll knock out
the inflammation for today.

34:00.171 --> 34:01.439
And then we are gonna
get her a team

34:01.506 --> 34:02.774
{\an1}of specialists
to tailor her medications

34:02.840 --> 34:04.442
to her specific symptoms.
I have to go.

34:06.711 --> 34:08.478
{\an3}Come on...

34:08.545 --> 34:10.380
That won't get it here
any faster.

34:10.447 --> 34:12.550
(gasps) The devices.
They're for teaching, right?

34:12.617 --> 34:14.452
{\an3}The contract
specifically says

34:14.518 --> 34:16.487
that they represent
a "typical human body,"

34:16.554 --> 34:18.656
except they are all
the exact same.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.391
They represent
one body type,

34:20.458 --> 34:22.092
and it is young, thin and white.

34:22.159 --> 34:23.293
To call it "typical"

34:23.360 --> 34:25.263
{\an3}is biased and
discriminatory.

34:25.329 --> 34:26.597
And it implies
that there is a standard.

34:26.664 --> 34:28.232
And that is a standard
that my patient

34:28.299 --> 34:30.134
nearly killed herself
trying to live up to.

34:30.201 --> 34:31.735
Which nobody wants to argue
in the court of public opinion.

34:31.803 --> 34:33.404
Exactly!

34:33.471 --> 34:35.072
Which is why

34:35.139 --> 34:36.541
{\an1}they are gonna let me
return all of those butts

34:36.607 --> 34:38.609
for a full refund.

34:38.676 --> 34:40.077
{\an1}Hello.

34:41.846 --> 34:43.414
Wow.

34:43.481 --> 34:44.581
VIVIAN:
<i>Boundaries.</i>

34:44.649 --> 34:45.616
I mean, deep down, he knew

34:45.683 --> 34:47.351
what he was doing he was wrong.

34:47.418 --> 34:51.755
{\an1}He just needed to hear it
in language he could understand.

34:51.822 --> 34:53.224
Now, of course,
he also needed a new set

34:53.291 --> 34:54.625
{\an5}of golf clubs, but...

34:53.291 --> 34:54.625
{\an3}(chuckles)

34:54.692 --> 34:56.527
{\an5}(laughs)

34:54.692 --> 34:56.527
That sounds like Griff.

34:56.594 --> 34:59.230
You know, he just handed over
the information

34:59.297 --> 35:02.800
{\an1}Sam needed to cancel
the contracts.

35:02.867 --> 35:07.071
{\an5}Asher, it was just...

35:02.867 --> 35:07.071
That sounds less like him.

35:10.908 --> 35:14.345
Hey. Want to help me
pack up some butts?

35:14.412 --> 35:17.548
Only a fool would say
no to that. (chuckles)

35:17.615 --> 35:19.650
{\an3}So, you called them and you
got them to give you a refund?

35:19.717 --> 35:21.252
Yeah, that's what they say.

35:21.319 --> 35:23.187
{\an1}I'm still waiting
on the confirmation email.

35:23.254 --> 35:27.525
Well, so might you say
you butt-dialed them?

35:29.494 --> 35:31.162
{\an1}(laughs):
No.

35:31.229 --> 35:33.264
(both laugh)

35:34.832 --> 35:37.134
I-I really needed that.

35:37.201 --> 35:38.736
Thank you.
(laughs)

35:38.803 --> 35:40.671
You always made me
laugh so much.

35:42.573 --> 35:43.774
I still could.

35:49.747 --> 35:51.349
How's Isan?

35:52.383 --> 35:54.285
Uh, he's... you know,

35:54.352 --> 35:56.420
it's a tough day, but he's on
the other side of it.

35:56.487 --> 35:58.189
(phone chimes)

35:58.256 --> 36:00.224
Ugh, please, please, please.

36:00.291 --> 36:02.660
{\an1}Ha!
(laughs, sighs)

36:02.727 --> 36:04.362
There's the email.

36:04.428 --> 36:06.564
Butts refunded in full.

36:07.565 --> 36:09.400
What is the company called?

36:09.467 --> 36:11.536
(stammers)
Uh, I think it Emoti-Med.

36:11.602 --> 36:13.671
{\an1}This says that
the $2 million refund

36:13.738 --> 36:15.573
{\an1}is coming from
"The Waxman Corporation."

36:15.640 --> 36:17.708
Well, that's okay-- it's
probably the parent company.

36:17.775 --> 36:20.278
No, no, no.

36:20.344 --> 36:21.779
Waxman?

36:21.846 --> 36:22.947
Oh, my God.

36:32.790 --> 36:35.259
Gerald Waxman.

36:35.326 --> 36:38.329
{\an3}(exhales)

36:38.396 --> 36:39.497
{\an3}Oh, Sam.

36:39.564 --> 36:41.966
It was never about the devices.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.435
I walked right into his trap.

36:51.676 --> 36:52.877
{\an3}Of course he didn't care
about the golf clubs.

36:52.944 --> 36:54.512
He just needed you to think

36:54.579 --> 36:56.380
that he wanted something,
that this was a trade.

36:56.447 --> 36:59.817
Gerald Waxman, multimillionaire
entrepreneur and philanthropist.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.987
<i>Lakeshore's internal says</i>
<i>he's given a ton of donations.</i>

37:03.054 --> 37:05.489
{\an5}SAM:
<i>Way more than the two million</i>
<i>his devices cost.</i>

37:05.556 --> 37:06.991
VIVIAN: <i> This month,</i>
<i>Waxman pledged to give</i>

37:07.058 --> 37:09.527
Lakeshore a new donation.

37:09.594 --> 37:10.795
{\an3}How much?

37:12.763 --> 37:13.965
(exhales)

37:15.666 --> 37:17.635
$12 million.

37:18.869 --> 37:20.338
(putter strikes golf ball)

37:25.476 --> 37:27.645
Waxie just called. Apparently,
he was counting on that sale

37:27.712 --> 37:29.947
{\an1}to raise the profile
of his new company, so...

37:30.014 --> 37:33.651
when you canceled the contract,
he canceled the donation.

37:33.718 --> 37:36.921
{\an1}You let Lakeshore lose
an eight-figure donation?

37:36.988 --> 37:38.589
And pinned it on me.

37:38.656 --> 37:41.525
I did tell you that the lesson
was gonna hurt.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.661
{\an5}Hmm.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.661
But class is done.

37:43.728 --> 37:45.763
We can put all this
behind us and move forward.

37:45.830 --> 37:47.531
Here's what's
gonna happen.

37:47.598 --> 37:48.833
I'll go down to storage

37:48.899 --> 37:50.501
{\an1}where they boxed up my stuff
when I was shot

37:50.568 --> 37:53.571
and unconscious
and you stole my job.

37:53.638 --> 37:55.573
{\an1}And somewhere down there
is a bottle

37:55.640 --> 37:58.409
of 50-year-old single malt.

37:58.476 --> 37:59.577
I'll take it to my office...

37:59.644 --> 38:01.812
It's Sam's office.

38:01.879 --> 38:04.015
You finish with your patients,
do what you have to do

38:04.081 --> 38:05.650
and come to see me.

38:06.917 --> 38:09.754
We'll have a drink,

38:09.820 --> 38:13.024
and negotiate your surrender.

38:15.893 --> 38:17.928
{\an1}Thanks for sticking
around to chat.

38:17.995 --> 38:19.830
{\an3}Always.

38:19.897 --> 38:23.901
Look, I respect what you said,

38:23.968 --> 38:25.903
but I can't sit this one out.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.072
I'm on Sam's side.

38:28.139 --> 38:31.809
Not because she needs me,
but because she doesn't.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.478
She is the better leader.

38:34.545 --> 38:35.913
Sam Griffith just made a mistake

38:35.980 --> 38:38.382
that cost Lakeshore
a lot of money.

38:38.449 --> 38:39.517
And I am sorry to hear that,

38:39.583 --> 38:40.918
but it doesn't
change my mind.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.720
She will find a way
to turn the tide.

38:42.787 --> 38:44.422
You don't sound very neutral.

38:44.488 --> 38:45.423
And you are?

38:45.489 --> 38:46.691
{\an1}Man, who are you
kidding?

38:46.757 --> 38:48.325
All this golf with Griff?

38:48.392 --> 38:49.994
That's my business, son.

38:51.028 --> 38:52.997
And Sam is mine.

38:54.965 --> 38:56.434
Do what you want.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.869
{\an3}But I can tell you
from experience,

38:58.936 --> 39:01.005
making alliances too early
in your career

39:01.072 --> 39:02.973
can lead to disaster.

39:06.777 --> 39:08.412
{\an5}SAM:
<i>You are gonna feel</i>
<i>so much better</i>

39:08.479 --> 39:09.513
{\an3}once the immune-modulating
medication

39:09.580 --> 39:10.948
and the steroids kick in.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.850
And your heart will
be healthier, too.

39:13.984 --> 39:16.587
You must think I'm so stupid.

39:18.556 --> 39:20.991
Tracy, I'm one of two women
in my department.

39:23.894 --> 39:26.464
We're both battling how
we're perceived every day.

39:27.565 --> 39:29.066
Baldwin left.

39:30.067 --> 39:32.069
He said it wasn't my age,

39:32.136 --> 39:34.472
it was the fact that I lied.

39:34.538 --> 39:36.073
Can I offer you
my professional opinion?

39:36.140 --> 39:37.541
You know, as a doctor?

39:39.043 --> 39:41.579
Baldwin does not deserve you.

39:43.814 --> 39:46.751
You're probably right.

39:46.817 --> 39:51.155
But it's hard to find someone,
you know?

39:51.222 --> 39:54.458
Someone you really gel with.

39:56.026 --> 39:57.128
Yeah.

39:57.194 --> 39:58.629
{\an3}I'm sorry.

39:58.696 --> 40:00.431
(ragged exhale)

40:06.971 --> 40:09.173
I'm gonna come
check on you later, okay?

40:09.240 --> 40:11.108
Okay.

40:16.981 --> 40:18.082
{\an4}Hey.

40:16.981 --> 40:18.082
{\an3}Hey.

40:18.149 --> 40:19.650
How was the Whipple?

40:19.717 --> 40:23.154
{\an3}Slayed it. But that's
not why I'm here.

40:23.220 --> 40:26.791
Thank you for what
you said earlier.

40:26.857 --> 40:28.559
{\an3}I know it's
hardest for you

40:28.626 --> 40:30.995
with the whole...
me and him thing.

40:31.061 --> 40:32.763
When those idiots
were talking about you,

40:32.830 --> 40:34.031
I wasn't thinking about that.

40:35.666 --> 40:38.035
I was just thinking
about my friend.

40:39.970 --> 40:41.872
The wine thing?

40:43.541 --> 40:45.976
Let's do that sooner than later.

40:46.043 --> 40:48.145
I would love that.

40:48.212 --> 40:49.713
Me, too.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.048
Shall we go tonight?

40:51.115 --> 40:55.586
Mm, unfortunately,
tonight I have to...

40:55.653 --> 40:59.156
drink with someone else.

41:01.892 --> 41:03.227
Excuse me.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.029
Are you Dr. Isan Shah?

41:05.095 --> 41:06.964
I am. Can I help you?

41:07.031 --> 41:08.666
{\an1}You've been named
