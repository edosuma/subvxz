02:33.890 --> 02:35.328
Are you a top or a bottom?

02:36.779 --> 02:37.832
I beg your pardon?

02:38.407 --> 02:39.407
I mean in real life.

02:40.389 --> 02:42.532
This is real life.

02:43.146 --> 02:44.550
Let me put it this way:

02:45.568 --> 02:47.127
Do you think we should get out of Iraq?

02:47.195 --> 02:48.195
Is your daddy paying for this?

02:48.537 --> 02:49.537
No.

02:52.222 --> 02:54.565
You're taking a picture of yourself at Ground Zero --

02:55.120 --> 02:56.570
do you smile?

02:57.484 --> 02:58.853
Get on the fucking bed!

04:17.427 --> 04:19.379
If you could have any superpower,
what would it be?

04:20.033 --> 04:22.031
The power to make you interesting.

04:23.838 --> 04:26.150
Do you think you'll ever have kids?

04:26.185 --> 04:27.312
You only have an hour.

04:27.347 --> 04:28.440
It's my money.

04:29.397 --> 04:32.080
Well, you fucking trust fund ** piece of fetish shit!

04:32.491 --> 04:33.443
I'm sorry!

04:33.478 --> 04:34.478
I'm sorry what?

04:34.506 --> 04:35.506
I'm sorry, Mistress Severin.

04:36.421 --> 04:37.421
But I'm serious.

04:37.850 --> 04:39.671
What are your thoughts on procreation?

04:40.969 --> 04:41.969
I want to do it by myself,

04:43.193 --> 04:44.193
in the dark.

04:44.549 --> 04:45.767
Like a worm.

05:37.959 --> 05:39.504
Can you describe your last orgasm?

05:39.972 --> 05:41.589
It was great.

05:41.590 --> 05:45.708
It was like time had stopped
and I was completely alone.

05:52.849 --> 05:53.849
Let's go, partner.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.763
I'm gonna miss my fucking train.

06:21.519 --> 06:22.519
Oh, God, oh.

06:25.598 --> 06:26.598
Oh, easy, easy.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.579
Were you sad afterwards?

06:48.222 --> 06:49.222
Yeah.

06:50.514 --> 06:51.514
Why?

06:52.574 --> 06:54.613
Cause time hadn't stopped.

06:56.075 --> 06:57.714
And I wasn't alone.

07:06.598 --> 07:08.374
Hey hon, I'm home!

07:11.157 --> 07:12.157
Hey.

07:12.628 --> 07:13.945
You doing yoga?

07:14.188 --> 07:15.188
Yeah.

07:15.189 --> 07:16.189
Sorry, I would have been here sooner.

07:16.789 --> 07:18.849
Somebody threw themselves in front of the L train.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.180
Hey.
- Hey.

07:25.074 --> 07:26.417
God, you're so sweaty.

07:26.686 --> 07:27.686
I love it.

07:29.693 --> 07:31.597
Wow!
- I just jerked off, actually.

07:32.652 --> 07:33.652
You did?

07:35.032 --> 07:36.999
Did you think of me?

07:40.314 --> 07:42.131
I'll go put on some clothes.

07:45.043 --> 07:46.578
This is recording!

07:46.579 --> 07:47.579
Fuck!

07:51.233 --> 07:53.559
When are you going to let me see
what you're working on?

07:53.560 --> 07:54.560
Soon.

08:08.366 --> 08:09.366
Thank you.

08:11.276 --> 08:12.661
Thank <i>you</i>...

08:14.514 --> 08:15.514
cutie.

08:16.473 --> 08:18.003
That was--
oh God, that was incredible.

08:18.545 --> 08:19.898
Definitely.

08:27.009 --> 08:29.545
Look, I do feel sorry for people who don't have what we have.

08:34.530 --> 08:35.530
Like Brad and Cheryl.

08:36.989 --> 08:38.203
Brad and Cheryl?

08:38.914 --> 08:41.796
Yeah, the couple I've been working with.

08:43.432 --> 08:45.105
Can you keep a secret?

08:45.106 --> 08:46.792
Of course I can keep a secret.

08:48.474 --> 08:53.502
Yesterday Cheryl told me
she's been faking her orgasms.

08:55.385 --> 08:57.880
She won't tell Brad because
she's afraid he'll break up with her.

08:58.419 --> 09:00.375
So I finally told her what I think she should do.

09:00.959 --> 09:02.623
What should she do?

09:02.624 --> 09:04.642
She should keep faking.

09:05.134 --> 09:08.043
It's a completely legitimate strategy to buy time.

09:08.044 --> 09:09.044
Really?

09:09.045 --> 09:14.020
Cause the thing is, if she tells Brad,
he's gonna think it's all his fault.

09:16.031 --> 09:17.031
You know?

09:17.475 --> 09:20.454
And the thing is, an orgasm
isn't something Brad can give her.

09:21.591 --> 09:23.719
She has to claim it for herself.

09:26.602 --> 09:27.945
What do you think?

09:29.217 --> 09:31.615
What do you mean with,
what do I think?

09:50.030 --> 09:51.030
Hi.

09:56.598 --> 09:58.360
Jamie and Jamie.

09:59.152 --> 10:01.326
Actually, I just started to call myself James again.

10:01.631 --> 10:03.568
I'm sorry. I keep forgetting.
- It's all right.

10:04.847 --> 10:06.995
Jamie and James.

10:06.996 --> 10:09.228
Tell me about yourselves.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.832
Well, I'm Jamie Mitchell.

10:12.310 --> 10:16.509
I was a child actor. I was on a
TV show called "One of the family".

10:18.244 --> 10:21.914
Where the rich black couple
adopted the poor white trash kid,

10:21.949 --> 10:24.925
and they didn't have the heart
to tell him he's not black?

10:24.973 --> 10:27.021
"I'm an albino!"

10:27.056 --> 10:29.072
I'm Canadian.

10:30.275 --> 10:32.999
Well, Jamie and I met
when I was doing research

10:33.000 --> 10:35.444
for "Take him from the streets".
I paid a street hustler.

10:36.625 --> 10:40.323
And -- James was -- well, he was --

10:40.324 --> 10:42.375
escorting at the time.

10:43.475 --> 10:45.031
James, what do you do now?

10:45.032 --> 10:46.861
Well, I don't hustle any more.

10:46.862 --> 10:48.386
Um, I guess I'm a...

10:48.387 --> 10:49.387
He's a lifeguard.

10:50.466 --> 10:51.466
Yeah, at a...

10:51.486 --> 10:53.386
a gym jacuzzi.

10:54.518 --> 10:55.518
Can you tell me why you're here?

10:56.939 --> 11:00.254
Recently we started about opening up our relationship, you know.

11:00.255 --> 11:01.255
Sexually.

11:02.396 --> 11:07.332
I was a little surprised when Jamie mentioned that he wanted to do this,

11:07.333 --> 11:10.346
and then I thought, well, we've been together five years,

11:10.347 --> 11:11.347
and -- I mean, let's face it,

11:12.192 --> 11:14.091
monogamy's for straight people.

11:14.092 --> 11:18.159
But we thought we should get an impartial opinion from a sex therapist.

11:19.974 --> 11:20.974
Dr Lin?

11:22.696 --> 11:24.915
Actually I prefer the term "couples counselor".

11:24.916 --> 11:27.972
Although I have a great deal of experience in sex therapy.

11:27.973 --> 11:31.342
Jamie, I'm wondering --
can you do me a big favor?

11:31.343 --> 11:32.343
Sure.

11:32.344 --> 11:33.344
Leave us alone.

11:36.511 --> 11:37.511
'K...

11:40.435 --> 11:41.306
Thanks.

11:41.341 --> 11:42.177
All right.

11:45.911 --> 11:47.915
Why are you here?

11:50.644 --> 11:53.549
Well, something did happen at work last week.

11:55.661 --> 11:59.448
Um, would you mind if I taped myself talking about this?

12:00.288 --> 12:04.912
See, I'm making this little film, and
I want to tape myself telling this story.

12:04.947 --> 12:05.724
Just me.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.725
Sure, OK.

12:11.458 --> 12:15.018
So I was at the gym last week...

12:44.441 --> 12:45.441
Oh, Jesus!

12:45.442 --> 12:48.051
There's something in there!
Something's on the bottom there!

12:54.633 --> 12:56.353
Can you help me?

13:36.594 --> 13:38.190
What was that?

13:38.191 --> 13:40.051
It must have been a brownout.

13:40.052 --> 13:41.052
Are you OK?

13:41.053 --> 13:42.053
Yeah, yeah.

13:42.054 --> 13:43.054
Everything's fine.

13:43.171 --> 13:45.736
You know, we're making some progress.

13:46.984 --> 13:51.001
I got to hear from James,
and now I'd love to hear from you, Jamie.

13:54.048 --> 13:57.105
Tell me what you need in your life right now.

13:58.179 --> 13:59.655
Well, I need Jamie.

14:00.205 --> 14:01.205
Besides James.

14:03.066 --> 14:05.728
We love each other so much.

14:07.098 --> 14:08.098
I just...

14:10.525 --> 14:12.271
I don't want to lose him.

14:13.559 --> 14:16.550
And I think about him and other guys,

14:16.551 --> 14:19.175
and then I think about me and other guys,

14:19.176 --> 14:22.894
and I think, maybe there's an opportunity here.

14:22.895 --> 14:28.312
I mean, there's a lot of good and cute people in the world who don't have any love in their lives,

14:28.313 --> 14:31.296
and I think we could help them.
I mean, I love cute people.

14:31.297 --> 14:33.597
Tell me what you need, in one sentence.

14:33.807 --> 14:34.807
I love everybody.

14:34.808 --> 14:36.804
That's not a need.

14:36.805 --> 14:39.919
I need to love everybody.

14:43.713 --> 14:45.552
Wait! Did you just hear me?

14:45.943 --> 14:47.714
"I need to love everybody"?

14:47.715 --> 14:50.251
How can I love everybody?
I can't even meet everybody!

14:50.252 --> 14:52.154
Wow! You're good!

14:52.155 --> 14:53.155
Thank you!
- Jamie...

14:54.192 --> 14:55.567
Thank you!
I'm having a breakthrough!

14:55.568 --> 14:58.085
Jamie, that's actually called a "false epiphany".

14:58.086 --> 15:00.254
Come on, give me a break!
Did you give him a breakthrough?

15:00.692 --> 15:02.224
You don't just dole out the breakthroughs.

15:02.225 --> 15:03.225
Well, you can!

15:03.226 --> 15:04.226
Don't you give yourself a breakthrough?

15:04.869 --> 15:05.869
I don't need a breakthrough.

15:05.979 --> 15:06.979
You're not gonna give me the breakthrough?

15:07.047 --> 15:08.047
I do not need a breakthrough.

15:08.425 --> 15:09.425
We all need breakthroughs.

15:09.546 --> 15:10.447
Well shut up and sit down!

15:10.482 --> 15:11.482
You shut up! And I...

15:11.517 --> 15:12.317
Sit down!

15:14.033 --> 15:16.307
Oh my God. I...

15:16.400 --> 15:18.613
I am so sorry.

15:19.444 --> 15:21.770
I'm not gonna charge you for this session.

15:24.900 --> 15:25.900
It's a...

15:30.093 --> 15:32.231
I'm preorgasmic.

15:34.727 --> 15:37.901
Does that mean you're about to have one?

15:37.902 --> 15:38.902
No.

15:40.296 --> 15:42.323
I've never had one.

18:06.433 --> 18:07.335
Get the hell out of here.

18:07.336 --> 18:07.939
Everybody hates you.

18:07.974 --> 18:08.543
Do you know who I am?

18:09.311 --> 18:10.122
Yes, I know who you are.

18:10.508 --> 18:11.317
Dr Donuts.

18:11.688 --> 18:12.540
Eat my twat, Dr Donuts!

18:12.837 --> 18:13.695
Fuck you!

18:14.115 --> 18:16.464
I hate carbs!

18:17.368 --> 18:18.323
What are you looking at?

18:18.386 --> 18:19.412
Nothing. Um--

18:19.683 --> 18:21.813
Jamie and, um, James told me to come here.

18:22.566 --> 18:24.042
What's your name?

18:24.043 --> 18:25.043
Sophia.

18:25.044 --> 18:28.472
Oh, Sophia! I'm Justin Bond.
I'm the mistress of Shortbus.

18:28.473 --> 18:29.473
Come on.

18:36.037 --> 18:37.467
Do you know what a shortbus is?

18:37.802 --> 18:38.275
No.

18:38.276 --> 18:40.414
You've heard of the Big Yellow School Bus?

18:40.873 --> 18:42.303
Well, this is the short one.

18:42.338 --> 18:45.021
It's a salon for the gifted and challenged.

18:45.978 --> 18:46.978
Hi-ha!

18:47.210 --> 18:50.365
That's Alice. She's got a cunt like a wizard's sleeve.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.331
This place has really taken off in the last few years,

18:52.332 --> 18:55.135
since all these young people started flocking to the city.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.618
Why would they come to New York?
It's so expensive to live here.

18:57.619 --> 18:58.619
9-11.

18:58.620 --> 19:01.117
It's the only thing real that's ever happened to them.

19:02.007 --> 19:04.125
Now in here is our performance room.

19:04.126 --> 19:06.397
But tonight we're having a film festival.

19:06.398 --> 19:09.326
They're boring as hell, but I've found the more boring they are,

19:09.361 --> 19:12.778
the more intelligent people think they are. But watch.

19:17.665 --> 19:19.101
"I'm an albino!"

19:20.212 --> 19:22.553
Oh, there's the Jamies.

19:24.856 --> 19:25.856
Hey. Mmm. Good to see you.

19:25.857 --> 19:26.857
Hi James.
- Hey.

19:29.185 --> 19:30.856
I'm so glad you came.

19:31.346 --> 19:35.117
I said to switch the films. We're gonna do
a three-hour Gertrude Stein documentary.

19:35.118 --> 19:36.975
That sounds like a real weenie shrinker.

19:36.976 --> 19:38.475
Come on, let's go get laid.

19:38.476 --> 19:39.476
You're gonna be all right?

19:39.511 --> 19:39.986
Yeah.

19:42.054 --> 19:43.054
What's the matter?

19:43.500 --> 19:44.500
Nothing.

19:45.632 --> 19:48.782
Are you sure you wanna try this tonight?

19:49.280 --> 19:51.425
No, that's too late.
It'll be good for us.

19:52.114 --> 19:53.203
Are you OK with it?

19:53.665 --> 19:53.854
Yeah...

19:57.222 --> 20:01.664
If you find somebody and I don't,
you know, that's totally cool.

20:02.089 --> 20:05.662
But if I find somebody and you don't,
that's a dealbreaker for me. I can't do that.

20:05.663 --> 20:06.663
No, don't do that.

20:08.380 --> 20:11.233
I spend half of my time blowing the NYPD to keep this place open.

20:11.268 --> 20:13.125
I barely have any time for myself.

20:13.661 --> 20:17.385
Here's the sex *** room.
This is where it all happens.

20:17.386 --> 20:19.340
Aren't they beautiful?

20:30.155 --> 20:34.704
It's not your average sort of Friday night event,
but people seem to be enjoying themselves.

20:34.705 --> 20:37.324
Last week we had some people in here,
I had to throw them out,

20:37.325 --> 20:39.153
'cause you know, this is my house...

21:23.323 --> 21:25.923
Oh, this is Creamy.
She's your maître d'.

21:25.924 --> 21:28.197
Pleased to meet you.
Can I help you with some condoms or lube?

21:28.770 --> 21:29.770
No, I'm fine, thank you.

21:29.805 --> 21:32.242
Well, then maybe some blondies.
These are cannabis-free,

21:32.243 --> 21:33.243
the pot corn isn't.

21:33.244 --> 21:34.244
Excuse me.

21:34.245 --> 21:35.245
Pot corn.

21:35.246 --> 21:37.684
These are actually not all for me.
Thank you so, so much.

21:37.685 --> 21:39.622
Why don't you come in and have a look?

21:39.657 --> 21:43.181
After all, voyeurism is participation.

21:46.354 --> 21:48.086
Well?

21:48.087 --> 21:50.375
Now come on.

21:51.348 --> 21:54.023
These bitches in there. Eating asses and sucking cock,

21:54.024 --> 21:57.072
and then they show up at the buffet and say they're vegan.

21:57.088 --> 21:58.088
Hi.

21:58.941 --> 21:59.941
Any bites?

22:00.604 --> 22:01.604
No.

22:01.605 --> 22:02.605
I love these little gadgets.

22:02.782 --> 22:04.582
Oh, this is Sophia.
She's a friend of the Jamies.

22:04.583 --> 22:05.583
You know the Jamies?

22:05.584 --> 22:08.229
I love the Jamies!
They're like the cutest couple in the whole world.

22:08.374 --> 22:09.817
Do you think you could introduce me to them?

22:09.852 --> 22:10.375
Yeah, probably.

22:11.317 --> 22:13.127
I'm Ceth, with a C.
- Justin...

22:13.128 --> 22:16.772
Hmm?
- Someone just came on your cat.

22:16.807 --> 22:18.116
It's not funny!

22:19.689 --> 22:20.689
Why can't they leave my pussy alone?

22:20.690 --> 22:22.079
What is that?

22:22.114 --> 22:25.385
That's the "yenta 650".
It's supposed to find me a husband.

22:25.386 --> 22:26.386
How does it work?

22:26.387 --> 22:27.387
I put in my profile...

22:27.720 --> 22:28.720
"I got a match for you!"

22:31.377 --> 22:35.964
Hi.
- I'm Magnus. And you are Keth?

22:37.184 --> 22:41.520
That's actually Ceth. So you're 1.9 meters tall?
What's that in feet and inches?

22:42.592 --> 22:44.756
Do you know?
Where are you from?

22:44.791 --> 22:46.866
Canada.   - Oh really?
- 6 1/2 feet.

22:47.742 --> 22:50.286
6 1/2. So that makes...
a 15 cm dick...

22:50.298 --> 22:51.198
Oh my God!

22:51.213 --> 22:53.590
Maybe we can talk about this if we sit?

22:53.591 --> 22:55.851
Yeah, I'll be right there.
- Great.

22:55.852 --> 22:56.872
Is my hair OK?

22:57.073 --> 22:58.773
Yeah, it's fine.

23:01.529 --> 23:02.529
Thanks.

23:03.826 --> 23:05.307
Sophia, come sit with us.

23:05.308 --> 23:06.308
OK.

23:08.655 --> 23:11.137
You make it sound like the Loch Ness monster.

23:11.172 --> 23:14.191
It doesn't seem like it should be so hard to find.

23:14.192 --> 23:18.387
It is so elusive, you know.
I'm starting to wonder if it's even natural.

23:18.388 --> 23:20.787
It's not necessary for procreation, is it?

23:20.788 --> 23:22.802
It only seems to appear in a handful of species

23:22.837 --> 23:27.256
like the rabbit, the ferret,
the bottle-nosed dolphin, the macaque, the bonobo,...

23:27.257 --> 23:30.417
"I'm an albino!"

23:30.418 --> 23:31.418
Thanks.

23:31.419 --> 23:34.766
Well I am, so it meant a lot to me.

23:34.767 --> 23:35.767
Oh, that means a lot to <i>me</i>, actually.

23:37.132 --> 23:38.132
Hey.

23:39.274 --> 23:40.274
Hey.

23:40.275 --> 23:41.623
You gonna be around later?

23:41.631 --> 23:42.531
Sure.

23:45.385 --> 23:46.527
Sorry. Go on.

23:46.528 --> 23:48.326
You know, I feel like we're inundated by images

23:48.361 --> 23:51.938
of these super deluxe babes in the throes of the ultimate orgasm...

23:51.973 --> 23:54.863
I think it's just some myth to sell more magazines.

23:55.854 --> 24:00.030
Whoa, myth? Did you just say that
female orgasms are a myth?

24:00.031 --> 24:01.031
Yeah.

24:01.032 --> 24:04.557
I'm here to tell you, sister, they're not.
- Here we go.

24:04.592 --> 24:06.480
I've seen them happen before.
They're completely real.

24:06.969 --> 24:08.959
Shabbos, Sophia.
Sophia, Shabbos.

24:08.960 --> 24:09.960
Hey kids.

24:10.587 --> 24:12.556
Nice to meet you.
I'm Shabbos Goy,

24:12.557 --> 24:15.093
and if you're Jewish
I can help you turn on your lights.

24:17.105 --> 24:18.332
I'm agnostic.

24:18.367 --> 24:19.254
Do you like performance art?

24:19.658 --> 24:20.344
Yeah, I do.

24:20.379 --> 24:22.634
OK, I'm gonna do a show soon, and I think that you should come to it.

24:22.635 --> 24:24.912
Might be a sort of therapeutic for your little problem.

24:24.947 --> 24:25.612
Excuse me?

24:25.613 --> 24:29.653
I have to say I find the fact that you can't have an orgasm completely unacceptable.

24:29.654 --> 24:31.078
I would really like to work with you.

24:31.079 --> 24:31.590
Shabbos!

24:32.080 --> 24:33.249
Maybe I can help her!

24:33.250 --> 24:35.274
You know, I'm sort of like a orgasmic superhero.

24:35.531 --> 24:42.000
"Have I got a match for you? Oy, **! Oy, sheyne ponim! Sheyne ponim at 11 o'clock! Come on, just get off and go! Why so picky?"

24:43.081 --> 24:44.612
Shit!

24:44.613 --> 24:47.061
Sir, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?

24:47.096 --> 24:51.027
My pacemaker. This odd vibration.

24:51.174 --> 24:52.651
I'm so sorry.

24:52.652 --> 24:53.652
No, no...

24:53.653 --> 24:55.534
I think that was my Yenta.

24:55.535 --> 24:56.535
Your-- your who?

24:59.452 --> 25:02.124
Don't I know you from somewhere?

25:02.125 --> 25:04.356
Well...

25:04.391 --> 25:08.699
I used to be the mayor of New York.

25:11.061 --> 25:12.724
Oh my God.

25:12.725 --> 25:14.590
It's called "Ode to the female secretion",

25:14.625 --> 25:16.719
and it works in five different movements:

25:16.720 --> 25:19.452
Lubrication, Lactation,

25:19.453 --> 25:21.705
Ejaculation --which is my favorite--,

25:21.740 --> 25:22.786
then Urinatinon and Menstruation.

25:22.850 --> 25:24.315
I think my throat's closing.

25:24.503 --> 25:25.452
I can't use the last two.

25:25.453 --> 25:26.758
Are you a really heavy bleeder?

25:26.759 --> 25:28.499
On my second and third days.

25:28.500 --> 25:29.500
That's so hot.

25:31.109 --> 25:33.730
You know, I use menstrual blood as makeup in my show.

25:33.983 --> 25:37.984
Tampons. Just pull them right out, fresh from the fruit, and use it as lipstick.

25:37.985 --> 25:38.985
It's a period piece.

25:39.775 --> 25:41.186
You're kidding.

25:41.523 --> 25:44.477
I should really use that in the show. 
That's the first funny thing you've ever said in your life.

25:44.478 --> 25:46.436
Would you be interested in doing that?

25:46.437 --> 25:47.437
You mean, donating... my...

25:47.438 --> 25:50.101
Some of your menstrual blood for my face.

25:50.102 --> 25:51.102
Oh, come on now!

25:51.103 --> 25:51.603
What?

25:51.604 --> 25:53.104
Join the line!

25:54.083 --> 25:56.437
Did that make you... 
I think it just made you uncomfortable

25:56.438 --> 25:57.237
because you're a little baby homo.
- What are you doing?

25:58.144 --> 26:00.110
Does this really have to do with an orgasm?

26:00.111 --> 26:01.111
It comes from her fucking pussy,

26:01.112 --> 26:02.776
why are you so fucking uncomfortable about it?

26:02.777 --> 26:03.777
I can deal with pussies!

26:03.778 --> 26:05.221
I'm around them all the time!

26:05.222 --> 26:07.148
I'm not talking about your fucking boyfriend.

26:08.704 --> 26:09.704
Get off of me!

26:10.719 --> 26:11.719
You got a boner!

26:12.033 --> 26:13.585
That's my cellphone, you fucking albino butch faggot!

26:14.969 --> 26:16.960
Want to fuck me there with your mangina?

26:17.349 --> 26:20.171
*** just for cockfucking me, you fucking dick.

26:27.089 --> 26:28.089
Hi.

26:29.104 --> 26:30.511
Are you OK?

26:32.203 --> 26:33.403
There's just, uh... 

26:33.404 --> 26:34.914
lots of, uh...

26:34.949 --> 26:36.983
Men?

26:36.984 --> 26:37.984
Yes.
- Jesus.

26:37.985 --> 26:38.985
My name is Bitch.

26:39.995 --> 26:40.912
Hi Bitch.

26:40.971 --> 26:41.960
You are?

26:41.961 --> 26:42.961
Sophia.

26:43.354 --> 26:44.740
Hey, sister. Sit down.

26:44.741 --> 26:46.917
You're in the right place.

26:46.918 --> 26:47.918
You're in the Pussy Palace.

26:49.579 --> 26:52.266
So you're a sex therapist
but you've never had an orgasm?

26:52.267 --> 26:54.735
Actually I prefer the term "couples counselor".

26:54.736 --> 26:55.736
Have you ever been with a woman?

26:56.761 --> 27:00.171
Uh, no, you know--
I'm not sure if I'm wired that way.

27:00.172 --> 27:02.759
Rob's the only person I've ever been with.

27:02.760 --> 27:03.760
Wow.
- It's cool.

27:03.761 --> 27:04.761
My god.

27:04.887 --> 27:07.336
You must have some major blue clit.

27:08.871 --> 27:10.502
Did you do those PC muscle exercises?

27:10.560 --> 27:12.455
You know, the PC muscle that controls your pee?

27:12.456 --> 27:14.620
So when you're peeing next time, 
just, you know,

27:14.655 --> 27:18.416
squeeze it up and then let it go. 
Squeeze it up, let it go.

27:18.417 --> 27:19.417
That's good for your orgasms.

27:19.418 --> 27:21.725
I'm doing it right now.

27:21.726 --> 27:22.726
Can you guys tell from my face?

27:23.295 --> 27:24.691
May I ask you a question?

27:24.785 --> 27:30.156
I wanna know what did your very orgasm feel like.

27:32.624 --> 27:34.033
Welcome to Lifetime Television.

27:34.068 --> 27:35.658
It's all about your pussies.

27:35.693 --> 27:41.473
This is gonna sound really cheesy, but 
I felt like I was shooting out creative energy into the world,

27:41.474 --> 27:49.578
and it was merging with other people's energy, 
and then there was no was. There was peace.

27:49.579 --> 27:50.579
Wow.

27:52.428 --> 27:55.150
Well, mine was definitely with Little Prince.

27:55.151 --> 27:57.473
We had this incredible connection.

27:57.474 --> 28:01.026
We just like made it really slow and still,

28:01.061 --> 28:04.563
and I felt like I was finally not alone.

28:08.362 --> 28:12.017
Mine felt like I was talking with the gods or something. 
You know, they were--

28:12.052 --> 28:13.605
Shut the fuck up.

28:13.902 --> 28:14.984
Excuse me?

28:14.985 --> 28:17.530
Sophia, if you've never had an orgasm,

28:17.565 --> 28:20.857
then how does it feel like 
for you to have sex?

28:21.859 --> 28:22.859
Great.

28:25.599 --> 28:27.337
Yeah. Sex is really awesome.

28:27.338 --> 28:28.338
I love sex.

28:31.396 --> 28:33.610
Sex feels terrific.
- That's great.

28:34.844 --> 28:36.349
I love it. A lot.

28:36.384 --> 28:39.003
It's a great workout. 
It feels good.

28:39.038 --> 28:40.887
And I love loving my husband.

28:40.922 --> 28:45.100
It's just, there comes a point sometimes where it gets a lot of pressure

28:45.729 --> 28:47.948
and kinda like,

28:47.949 --> 28:48.949
it feels a little bit, 
kinda like, um,

28:50.682 --> 28:52.261
like somebody's gonna kill me,

28:52.296 --> 28:56.235
and I just have to smile 
and pretend to enjoy it.

28:57.548 --> 28:59.686
And that way I can survive.

29:05.396 --> 29:06.865
Fuck, Severin.

29:06.900 --> 29:09.594
Excuse me, that was totally inappropriate.

29:09.862 --> 29:12.787
Don't mind her.
- Freak.

29:38.059 --> 29:40.633
But you know what's the most wonderful thing about New York?

29:40.634 --> 29:41.634
What?

29:41.635 --> 29:43.420
It's where everyone comes to get fucked.

29:45.749 --> 29:48.550
It's one of the last places where people are still willing to bend over

29:48.585 --> 29:50.775
to let in the new.

29:53.828 --> 29:55.546
And the old.

30:06.679 --> 30:10.903
New Yorkers are... permeable.

30:10.904 --> 30:11.822
You know what I mean?

30:11.847 --> 30:13.132
Yeah.

30:13.148 --> 30:14.530
You sure are?

30:16.265 --> 30:18.508
Therefore we're sane.

30:18.509 --> 30:27.520
Consequently, we're the target of the impermeable. 
And the insane.

30:30.277 --> 30:37.231
And of course, New York is where everyone comes to be forgiven.

30:40.417 --> 30:42.959
What have you done wrong?

30:51.687 --> 30:54.649
Tell me, how have you sinned?

30:57.875 --> 30:59.932
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

30:59.933 --> 31:00.933
How would you know?

31:00.934 --> 31:06.522
Well, I'm-- I'm sure you did your best.

31:08.092 --> 31:13.214
Imagine if you grew up here like I did.

31:16.079 --> 31:22.460
Home can be very unforgiving.

31:25.523 --> 31:27.225
It's true.

31:27.260 --> 31:32.441
People said I didn't do enough

31:32.442 --> 31:35.908
to help prevent the AIDS crisis

31:35.909 --> 31:39.928
because I was in the closet.

31:42.654 --> 31:44.356
That's not true.

31:44.391 --> 31:47.835
I did the best I could.

31:49.562 --> 31:50.562
I was--

31:52.688 --> 31:54.198
I was scared

31:56.479 --> 31:58.592
and--

31:59.929 --> 32:00.929
impermeable.

32:03.938 --> 32:06.903
Everybody knew so little then.

32:11.491 --> 32:17.075
I know even less now.

34:02.364 --> 34:03.364
Chip?

34:12.302 --> 34:13.302
No, I'm OK.

34:19.478 --> 34:20.478
Who's that?

34:21.964 --> 34:23.627
If he's wearing a blue shirt, it's me.

34:24.952 --> 34:25.952
It's you.

34:27.166 --> 34:28.253
I made that for him.

34:28.288 --> 34:29.697
Oh yeah?

34:29.697 --> 34:31.772
That's Jamie there on the back.

34:31.806 --> 34:33.373
Oh my God.

34:33.408 --> 34:35.393
Shut up, that's so cute!

34:36.929 --> 34:38.868
How old are you guys?

34:38.869 --> 34:39.869
Seven.

34:39.870 --> 34:40.870
Six.

34:42.768 --> 34:44.231
Somewhere around there.

34:49.715 --> 34:52.031
I think I'm actually gonna go.

34:52.032 --> 34:54.150
What? No!

34:54.150 --> 34:55.150
Yeah.

34:55.152 --> 34:56.152
No, it's OK. It's cool.

34:56.152 --> 34:57.153
Are you sure?

34:57.154 --> 34:58.154
No.

34:58.155 --> 35:00.156
Yeah.

35:01.885 --> 35:03.538
Hang out for a while.

35:03.539 --> 35:04.539
OK.

35:04.896 --> 35:06.320
Come on.

35:32.729 --> 35:34.980
How do I be a model?

35:36.134 --> 35:38.458
A lot of it's instinct, to be honest. 

35:38.493 --> 35:40.347
But there are some basics.

35:40.348 --> 35:42.801
The way I like to think about it, it's like geometry.

35:42.836 --> 35:44.848
Like lines and angles.

36:04.090 --> 36:05.090
I like that.

36:07.971 --> 36:09.555
That's perfect. That's like an ad right there.

36:11.626 --> 36:12.626
See, you got it.

36:14.227 --> 36:16.382
Whatever, I hate it. It totally sucks.

36:32.965 --> 36:33.965
James?

36:33.966 --> 36:34.966
Yeah?

36:35.805 --> 36:37.429
Can you actually use your other hand?

36:37.464 --> 36:40.454
'Cause I usually command it from a different angle.

36:40.489 --> 36:41.654
Sure.

36:44.402 --> 36:45.349
How's that?

36:45.384 --> 36:46.296
That's fine.

36:55.112 --> 36:56.392
That feels really good.

36:57.388 --> 36:58.262
What?

36:58.263 --> 36:58.870
Huh?

37:00.628 --> 37:02.150
Just say something.
- What are you talking...

37:02.499 --> 37:04.114
Make more sounds.

37:04.721 --> 37:05.814
"I'm an albino!"

37:07.018 --> 37:08.018
"I'm an albino!"

37:09.567 --> 37:10.567
"I'm an albino!"

37:12.099 --> 37:16.669
"O say, can you see"

37:16.670 --> 37:22.723
"by the dawn’s early li-i-i-i-i-ight"

37:22.724 --> 37:33.788
"O say, does that
star-spangled banner yet wave"

37:33.789 --> 37:43.438
"O’er the land of the free-e-e-e-eee"

37:43.439 --> 37:52.694
"and the home of the b-rave?"

37:55.590 --> 37:58.044
Is that the first time somebody sang the National Anthem in your ass?

37:58.045 --> 37:59.045
No.

38:30.505 --> 38:32.609
OK, rotate.

38:36.812 --> 38:39.205
Carpet burn.

38:52.236 --> 38:54.531
Jamie, can I watch you fuck him?

40:46.054 --> 40:47.848
I want you.

40:50.936 --> 40:52.991
You. You. You.

41:36.343 --> 41:39.058
That's it.

41:39.059 --> 41:41.110
Fuck...

42:02.917 --> 42:05.119
Fuck!

42:13.869 --> 42:14.644
Rob!

42:14.645 --> 42:15.609
What?

42:15.644 --> 42:16.577
It's too loud!

42:17.024 --> 42:18.031
No, it's not.

42:18.066 --> 42:18.542
It is!

42:18.543 --> 42:19.184
It's not!

42:19.185 --> 42:19.948
It is!

42:19.949 --> 42:20.329
It's not too loud!

42:20.350 --> 42:21.306
I can't concentrate!

42:21.307 --> 42:22.209
I'm looking for a job, OK?

42:22.210 --> 42:23.210
What kind of a job, a hand job?

42:24.664 --> 42:26.596
For Christ's sake, turn the fucking music off!

42:26.876 --> 42:27.994
And look at this place.

42:27.995 --> 42:30.925
I just got the fucking cleaners in here yesterday!

42:30.926 --> 42:32.416
These are my dried cranberries--

42:32.451 --> 42:34.047
And you bought everything in this house!

42:37.275 --> 42:38.538
Fuck - you!

42:41.126 --> 42:45.091
We agreed to come from a place of love.

42:52.489 --> 42:55.583
I feel your warm and loving hands.

42:57.657 --> 42:59.892
And I feel worried that you think I'm ugly.

43:01.611 --> 43:03.997
Because why else would you be doing that on the computer.

43:04.465 --> 43:06.873
I'm squeezing your perfectly round shoulders,

43:06.874 --> 43:09.892
following to your clavicle and your collarbone,

43:09.893 --> 43:12.273
so you know that you're incredibly attractive.

43:12.308 --> 43:13.151
I think you're incredibly sexy.

43:14.103 --> 43:16.356
And I'm just distracting myself.

43:17.167 --> 43:20.215
I feel the sleeves of your T-shirt.

43:20.250 --> 43:22.283
They're dry against my clammy hands.

43:22.284 --> 43:23.427
Your skin is perfect

43:23.462 --> 43:25.231
like I could never get this on a computer.

43:25.232 --> 43:26.860
'Cause I'm just-- blocked.

43:26.895 --> 43:29.025
Totally. We're both blocked, and--

43:29.336 --> 43:30.480
Oh god, that feels good.

43:30.481 --> 43:31.727
Really?

43:31.762 --> 43:34.026
Shit, I'm so crunchy up there.

43:35.509 --> 43:37.668
How about you unblock these beautiful breasts?

43:37.703 --> 43:39.070
Your pertinent nipples.

43:39.071 --> 43:40.071
"Pertinent"?

43:40.072 --> 43:41.503
Very relevant.

43:41.538 --> 43:42.898
Aw! Jeez!

43:42.933 --> 43:44.705
I am not a cow!

43:44.873 --> 43:46.813
I know you're not a cow, baby--

43:46.814 --> 43:47.814
It felt that way.

43:47.815 --> 43:49.540
It felt like I was a cow.

43:50.628 --> 43:51.628
You wanna know why?
- That's what you felt.
- Yes. I own that.

43:53.965 --> 43:55.198
Can we try it again?

43:55.199 --> 43:57.903
I'm feeling your strong biceps.

43:57.904 --> 44:02.091
They're so tender and smooth.

44:02.092 --> 44:04.509
Oh god, when you flex them,

44:04.544 --> 44:06.013
they're just like breasts.

44:07.088 --> 44:10.581
I feel the delicate wisps of your receding hairline...

44:10.644 --> 44:11.823
I'm not balding.

44:11.824 --> 44:14.147
Yes you are, honey. You are.

44:14.182 --> 44:17.961
And I love your balding, virile head.

44:19.002 --> 44:20.403
I feel really small.

44:20.404 --> 44:21.895
That's because we are small.

44:21.896 --> 44:23.753
We're so very small.

44:23.754 --> 44:24.754
No!

44:26.037 --> 44:28.910
I'm saying that I feel small.

44:29.890 --> 44:31.882
I feel like I can't take up enough space.

44:33.042 --> 44:35.462
I feel like my cock isn't big enough for you.

44:35.463 --> 44:37.813
This is your issue, and you have to own it.

44:37.814 --> 44:39.205
Because I am not a size queen, 
and I don't care about...

44:39.236 --> 44:42.067
I can't bring home any money. 
I feel like I'm not contributing.

44:42.759 --> 44:45.123
I love the fact that you deliver Meals on Wheels.

44:45.158 --> 44:47.518
You volunteer. It's beautiful. 
Why would you...

44:47.519 --> 44:50.658
Bullshit. I can't even give you an orgasm.

44:52.415 --> 44:54.358
Yes, you... many times you have.

44:54.525 --> 44:55.525
Bullshit!

44:55.526 --> 44:57.235
I think we can get over this.

44:57.270 --> 45:00.648
We can work this through. We've been through a lot of stuff together.

45:00.649 --> 45:02.284
I can't give you an orgasm!

45:15.068 --> 45:16.068
Hello?

45:16.911 --> 45:19.436
Hi. Is this Severin?

45:19.437 --> 45:20.437
Yeah.

45:20.438 --> 45:23.836
Hey. It's Sophia.

45:35.481 --> 45:38.455
So, do you like to jerk off?

45:38.490 --> 45:40.250
Of course I do.

45:42.761 --> 45:45.828
What are you doing with the cigarette in here?

45:45.863 --> 45:47.791
Please, put that out!

45:47.826 --> 45:49.349
This is a non-smoking environment.

45:49.350 --> 45:52.259
That's totally absurd. 
We're completely surrounded by water.

45:52.294 --> 45:54.272
It's like a dream smoking environment.

45:54.273 --> 45:55.273
You're gonna kill us in here.

45:56.354 --> 45:57.840
That feels good.

45:57.875 --> 45:59.392
Thank you.

45:59.427 --> 46:01.809
What about your husband, has he ever tried to get you off?

46:01.810 --> 46:02.810
This is not about Rob?

46:03.223 --> 46:06.109
70% of all women have trouble achieving an orgasm.

46:06.144 --> 46:07.702
70% of all men are assholes.

46:07.703 --> 46:08.703
He's not an asshole, he's a great guy.

46:08.900 --> 46:11.519
If it wasn't for Rob, I'd still be a bank teller.

46:11.520 --> 46:12.520
He totally changed my life around.

46:12.521 --> 46:13.521
He's my best friend.

46:14.644 --> 46:17.857
Why is it so important for you to have an orgasm anyway?

46:17.858 --> 46:20.927
I mean, it feels good, but it's not gonna save your life.

46:20.928 --> 46:23.040
I wanna be welcomed into the secret society of women.

46:23.041 --> 46:25.664
I was never a brownie. 
I haven't had an orgasm.

46:25.665 --> 46:27.813
God, I want to be able to save my marriage.

46:27.848 --> 46:29.536
What does it have to do with your marriage?

46:29.537 --> 46:31.640
It has a lot to do with--
- I think it has nothing to do with the other person.

46:31.675 --> 46:33.523
Like, I can only come if it's my own hand.

46:33.524 --> 46:38.426
It has everything to do, because 
you need two people to make love.

46:38.427 --> 46:39.921
No you don't.

46:40.450 --> 46:42.708
Have you even had a relationship?

46:48.362 --> 46:50.918
So were you like, abused as a child?

46:52.299 --> 46:53.299
No.

46:53.300 --> 46:54.300
Were you?

46:54.301 --> 46:55.301
No!

46:56.270 --> 46:58.991
I come from a very traditional Chinese Canadian family.

46:58.992 --> 47:01.402
I love Chinese Canadian food, but what does that have to do with it?

47:01.800 --> 47:03.483
Chinese families are very strict.

47:05.175 --> 47:07.235
My mom was a disciplinarian,

47:08.112 --> 47:11.235
and my father... was...

47:11.270 --> 47:13.346
my father was a great guy.

47:13.381 --> 47:15.481
Did he touch you?
- No.

47:16.692 --> 47:18.446
No, he didn't touch me.

47:18.481 --> 47:20.243
He didn't touch anyone, ever.

47:20.244 --> 47:22.684
Oh I see. Like, "My father wasn't there, 

47:22.719 --> 47:24.337
I can't feel anything between the legs."

47:24.372 --> 47:26.402
You are so far behind you think you're first.

47:28.144 --> 47:30.342
God, he was alway there for me.

47:30.377 --> 47:32.939
It's just-- he was always there for me, that was the problem.

47:32.940 --> 47:33.940
He was always watching me. 
He was always watching me.

47:36.001 --> 47:38.003
Watching you how?

47:39.168 --> 47:41.436
You want me to say he raped me without touching me?

47:41.437 --> 47:42.437
Well, did he?

47:44.784 --> 47:45.784
Did he?

47:45.785 --> 47:47.797
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

47:47.798 --> 47:48.798
I'm sorry.

47:49.029 --> 47:53.421
Domination, black and white-- it's not as simple. 
Relationships are more complex than that?

47:53.422 --> 47:56.520
Are you saying that I can't understand your relationship with your father who "watched you",

47:56.555 --> 48:00.202
because I'm a dominatrix?

48:00.203 --> 48:01.203
Well, yes!

48:01.204 --> 48:03.595
That's really funny, because you're a sex therapist

48:03.596 --> 48:05.783
and you can't have an orgasm.

48:05.818 --> 48:07.418
You should be in... 
Where are you going?

48:07.453 --> 48:10.331
I am not one of your clients who pays to be dominated!

48:10.332 --> 48:12.710
Sophia, this is like the best conversation I've had over years.

48:12.711 --> 48:13.711
Let go of my arm!

48:14.381 --> 48:15.743
I won't grab you.

48:16.708 --> 48:18.223
Please, I'm--
I'm sorry, OK? I just--

48:19.964 --> 48:22.853
Sometimes when I get uncomfortable, I get mean.

48:22.854 --> 48:24.819
You are not gonna keep me keen by treating me mean.

48:25.344 --> 48:27.613
Look, I know I can help you have an orgasm.

48:27.614 --> 48:32.764
And maybe you can help me having a real human interaction with someone?

48:32.765 --> 48:35.332
Maybe we could meet here every week for an hour.

48:35.333 --> 48:36.983
I'm in a crisis.

48:37.018 --> 48:39.584
All right, every night this week, starting tomorrow.

48:44.527 --> 48:46.518
You're sitting all by yourself.

48:47.598 --> 48:50.078
And you look up, and there he is.

48:50.824 --> 48:52.432
With his lunch tray.

48:52.631 --> 48:53.681
What's his name again?

48:53.682 --> 48:55.402
Phil.

48:55.403 --> 48:56.403
Phil Mudd.

48:58.030 --> 48:59.743
Severin's not my real name.

49:02.437 --> 49:04.113
What is your real name?

49:06.403 --> 49:10.786
So Phil Mudd says, "Is anyone sitting here?"

49:11.443 --> 49:14.703
And you say, "No one's ever sat here."

49:15.487 --> 49:17.122
OK, I'm going down.

49:21.273 --> 49:26.123
Feel the thought first. 
<i>Then</i> get on the bus.

49:26.727 --> 49:29.361
Just whisper it to me. 
Whisper it in my ear.

49:32.300 --> 49:34.365
I can't do it.

49:34.366 --> 49:35.366
Oh, Phil!

49:36.977 --> 49:39.165
I want you to see his lunch tray.

49:40.509 --> 49:43.252
It's got a carton of homogenized milk.

49:44.181 --> 49:46.523
Pour that all over you.

49:47.504 --> 49:51.114
Look at his Converse. 
He markered them all up.

49:52.083 --> 49:55.358
OK, if you can't say it, 
then just simply write it down.

49:55.663 --> 49:59.883
Feel the thought first. 
<i>Then</i> get on the bus.

50:08.994 --> 50:12.131
All right. You gotta pull the bus over. 
You're not riding safely. Park.

50:17.820 --> 50:19.240
Jennifer.

50:20.640 --> 50:22.777
That's a lovely name.

50:25.014 --> 50:26.014
Oh Jennifer.

50:29.090 --> 50:31.618
What's your last name?

50:37.903 --> 50:38.903
Aniston?

50:45.640 --> 50:47.307
Jennifer Aniston.

50:49.209 --> 50:51.253
There's room for two in this world.

50:52.861 --> 50:55.608
Good going! It's OK! It's all right!

50:57.490 --> 50:59.479
Good work today, Jennifer.

52:24.717 --> 52:26.980
It's a remote-controlled vibrating egg.

52:28.037 --> 52:29.965
Where'd you get this?

52:30.370 --> 52:31.370
That's not important.

52:35.389 --> 52:36.915
OK, so here's the plan:

52:36.950 --> 52:40.334
We'll mingle separately to see what we can experience safely,

52:40.335 --> 52:43.720
and once in a while, I want you to check in with me

52:43.721 --> 52:44.721
with this.

52:45.526 --> 52:46.945
Jesus Christ, Sophia!

52:46.980 --> 52:51.612
I want you to have control. 
So if you're feeling threatened or horny

52:51.647 --> 52:54.139
or if you just wanna check in and say "Hey", 
buzz me, OK?

52:57.124 --> 52:58.977
Come on, it'll be fun!

52:58.978 --> 52:59.978
It'll be hot.

53:03.085 --> 53:04.085
Come back, bitch!

53:06.755 --> 53:08.193
That's "Bumble bee kisses".

53:08.194 --> 53:09.194
Oh, that's nice.

53:41.693 --> 53:45.101
It's just like the 60s, only with less hope.

53:46.239 --> 53:47.646
See anything you like?

53:47.647 --> 53:50.558
Oh Jesus. It's a lot of stuff that I'm seeing. It's incredible.

53:52.049 --> 53:54.534
For a minute I thought that man didn't have an arm.

53:55.633 --> 53:58.902
So, how's the big O coming?

53:59.911 --> 54:00.911
Oh, everybody's talking about it.

54:00.912 --> 54:04.755
Everybody here knows.
"That's the girl that can't have orgasms."

54:06.101 --> 54:08.665
You're sitting up here in your corner 
with your flower choking your throat.

54:08.700 --> 54:12.481
I mean, sweetheart, you gotta loosen up a little bit.

54:12.482 --> 54:14.350
I mean, you have nice boobs.

54:14.385 --> 54:17.276
You've got what it takes, sweetheart, what's the holdup?

54:17.277 --> 54:21.213
I think I have some sort of clog in my neural pathways

54:21.248 --> 54:23.878
somewhere between my brain and my clitoris.

54:24.699 --> 54:26.046
That's disgusting.

54:26.047 --> 54:27.047
No, I'm serious.

54:27.048 --> 54:28.381
Don't think of it as a clog.

54:28.416 --> 54:35.574
Think of it as some sort of magical circuit board. 
A motherboard, filled with desire, that travels all over the world.

54:35.575 --> 54:38.432
That touches you, that touches me, that connects everybody.

54:38.467 --> 54:42.043
You just have to find the right connection, the right circuitry.

54:42.044 --> 54:43.754
Look at all these people out there.

54:43.789 --> 54:45.451
They're trying to find the right connection.

54:45.452 --> 54:47.973
And I personally expect a few blown fuses

54:48.008 --> 54:49.462
before the night is over.

54:49.463 --> 54:51.761
And maybe one of them will be yours.

54:53.821 --> 54:57.401
Are you suggesting that Rob and I aren't compatible sexually?

54:57.930 --> 54:58.930
Who the hell is Rob?

54:58.931 --> 54:59.931
My husband.

54:59.932 --> 55:00.932
Well, where is he right now?

55:00.933 --> 55:01.933
I don't know.

55:02.580 --> 55:04.516
Well, then it's time to play.

55:04.551 --> 55:09.061
You've got the whole world. It's your playground. What do you think it will take?

55:09.096 --> 55:13.788
Maybe somebody who's just starting to explore their sexuality, somebody...

55:13.823 --> 55:14.900
Like a child?

55:16.104 --> 55:17.746
No.

55:17.781 --> 55:18.781
Not a child.

55:18.782 --> 55:21.186
I'm not recommending it. I'm just asking.

55:21.187 --> 55:23.385
I'm just trying to help you, dear.

55:24.616 --> 55:25.616
You're touching my thigh.

55:25.617 --> 55:26.617
Oh, I'm sorry.

55:26.618 --> 55:27.618
It's OK.

55:28.262 --> 55:29.262
I don't mind.

55:33.693 --> 55:37.933
Hey-- OK. What if I asked you, um-- if I can kiss you?

55:39.523 --> 55:41.167
Well, I don't know, I mean...

55:41.631 --> 55:43.550
I get really scared sometimes, but...

55:45.453 --> 55:49.004
all right, if you want to, but...
just real gently.

55:52.509 --> 55:53.509
OK.

56:15.290 --> 56:17.435
Wow. That was fast.

56:17.436 --> 56:19.318
No, it's my husband.
- Oh.

56:19.353 --> 56:22.701
He's trying to communicate with me.
- Oh.

56:30.784 --> 56:33.866
Oh my godness, how sad! Do you want a hug?
- I just want--
- Can I use your leash for a second?

56:37.133 --> 56:39.433
Jesus, do you have a cellphone in your twat?

56:39.434 --> 56:41.836
No, it's-- um, he's got the remote control.

56:41.871 --> 56:44.728
It's... this... vibrating, uh...

56:45.871 --> 56:51.051
OK, lady. Well, you know, best of luck, thanks for everything,

56:51.086 --> 56:54.976
as my dear departed friend Lotus Weinstock used to say:

56:54.978 --> 56:57.166
"I used to want to change the world.

56:57.167 --> 57:00.938
"Now I just want to leave the room with a little dignity."

57:00.939 --> 57:04.009
Excuse me while I crawl out of here.
- Um...

57:16.102 --> 57:17.102
That's fun.

57:20.125 --> 57:21.125
Are you guys hard?

57:22.828 --> 57:25.140
I get something to drink. I'll be right back.

57:29.616 --> 57:31.902
Wow. So weird.

57:32.369 --> 57:33.948
He's awesome.

57:37.852 --> 57:39.117
Do you think that...

57:39.152 --> 57:40.300
What?

57:43.464 --> 57:48.400
I don't know, I mean, 
I've heard of three-way relationships,

57:48.435 --> 57:50.142
but they're mostly in Berkeley.

57:51.303 --> 57:52.303
What do you think?

57:52.304 --> 57:53.304
I don't know.

57:53.305 --> 57:54.305
He's great.

57:54.306 --> 57:56.516
And I think we'll learn to do a lot, you know.

57:58.417 --> 58:00.157
That's good. It's a good thing.

58:04.098 --> 58:05.098
What?

58:05.099 --> 58:06.099
It's a good thing?

58:06.100 --> 58:07.100
Yeah!

58:08.928 --> 58:10.708
What's a good thing?

58:12.737 --> 58:13.302
I just think...

58:13.337 --> 58:14.791
Do you hear yourself?

58:14.826 --> 58:16.682
Do you even know what you're saying any more?

58:16.683 --> 58:17.683
'Cause I don't.

58:19.202 --> 58:22.170
I'm sick of having to drag every little thing out of you.

58:24.453 --> 58:26.383
I mean--

58:26.384 --> 58:29.168
I know you get depressed, but come on!

58:30.357 --> 58:31.357
I'm trying!

58:38.002 --> 58:39.002
Do you love me?

58:42.345 --> 58:44.178
You don't love me any more?

59:02.420 --> 59:03.420
Severin! Wait up!

59:03.421 --> 59:04.421
Wait!

59:13.401 --> 59:15.165
Ohhhhh!

59:15.166 --> 59:17.020
How's it going?

59:17.030 --> 59:18.456
Pretty great.

59:19.280 --> 59:21.078
You had an orgasm?

59:21.793 --> 59:24.371
No, but-- I made out with somebody.

59:24.719 --> 59:25.370
Who?

59:25.405 --> 59:26.405
Justin Bond.

59:28.173 --> 59:29.678
He's an homosexual!

59:29.679 --> 59:31.181
Apparently not.

59:31.200 --> 59:32.607
Oh my god.

59:32.800 --> 59:33.800
Well, he's really cute.

59:33.801 --> 59:35.293
Yeah, he is.

59:35.774 --> 59:38.126
I saw Rob, by the way.

59:40.271 --> 59:41.721
Yeah. What was he up to?

59:42.590 --> 59:44.543
He was getting fucked up the ass.

59:46.960 --> 59:47.960
It was really intense.

59:48.192 --> 59:49.192
Oh god.

59:51.552 --> 59:53.074
I'm just kidding.

59:54.697 --> 59:57.178
You brat!
- No, seriously, though-- he was.

59:59.805 --> 01:00:01.421
I should probably go find him.

01:00:03.763 --> 01:00:04.763
What's with him?

01:00:05.681 --> 01:00:08.309
That fucking trust fund muppet Jesse is

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:12.586
like the longest relationship I've ever had.

01:00:13.173 --> 01:00:15.432
You deserve so much more, Jennifer.

01:00:15.433 --> 01:00:18.434
Thank you, but I can't respond to that name yet.

01:00:18.435 --> 01:00:19.435
I'm sorry.

01:00:25.089 --> 01:00:27.233
I can't do it any more.

01:00:29.795 --> 01:00:31.073
I can't...

01:00:31.074 --> 01:00:32.403
I just like...

01:00:32.438 --> 01:00:38.073
wanna have like a house, a cat, 
a pet, you know what I'm saying?

01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:41.390
I'm sorry.

01:00:41.391 --> 01:00:43.075
No, you shouldn't apologize.

01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:45.049
I'm glad that you're telling me these things.

01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:46.050
I want to hear you say these things.

01:00:47.773 --> 01:00:49.191
I'm gonna save up all my money,

01:00:49.192 --> 01:00:53.254
and then I'm just gonna make art for a year. Nothing else.

01:00:54.104 --> 01:00:55.303
I know you can do it.

01:00:55.304 --> 01:00:57.503
But everything's so fucking expensive!

01:00:58.319 --> 01:01:00.970
I don't even know if I can afford to live in New York any more.

01:01:01.005 --> 01:01:03.160
Where would I go, Fresno?

01:01:10.707 --> 01:01:11.707
It's OK.

01:01:14.765 --> 01:01:16.585
Your skin is so soft.

01:01:51.248 --> 01:01:52.248
Jesus.

01:01:52.657 --> 01:01:53.657
Rob.

01:01:53.658 --> 01:01:54.658
Hi, Rob.

01:02:00.275 --> 01:02:01.275
Oh my god.

01:02:05.865 --> 01:02:06.865
Oh, man.

01:02:11.391 --> 01:02:12.391
Oh god.

01:02:23.574 --> 01:02:26.161
Don't move.

01:02:46.907 --> 01:02:47.907
I'm so sorry.

01:02:51.632 --> 01:02:52.632
It's OK.

01:02:52.667 --> 01:02:53.633
I'm sorry.

01:02:53.634 --> 01:02:54.634
Don't apologize.
- Fuck.

01:03:04.258 --> 01:03:06.798
I just-- I'm like, so sensitive.

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:10.925
I should find Rob.

01:03:13.516 --> 01:03:15.505
You can tell me all about it tomorrow.

01:03:18.862 --> 01:03:19.862
Actually, um--

01:03:22.152 --> 01:03:25.648
I can't make it tomorrow, but I will give you a call.

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:31.991
I'll give you a call. Later this week.

01:03:51.588 --> 01:03:52.532
Christ.

01:03:52.567 --> 01:03:53.567
Truth or dare?

01:03:53.816 --> 01:03:54.816
Truth.

01:03:54.817 --> 01:03:59.437
Out of everyone here, who would you want to make out with the most?

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:01.499
No one.

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.500
What?
- Bus cow.

01:04:04.552 --> 01:04:05.552
OK, spin.

01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:12.510
Dare.

01:04:12.511 --> 01:04:15.030
You and Severin have to go in that closet.

01:04:15.065 --> 01:04:18.808
You do whatever the fuck you want to to her, for five minutes. While we take a pee break.

01:04:25.154 --> 01:04:26.154
Oh my god.

01:04:41.313 --> 01:04:43.967
I'm not gonna make out with you, OK?

01:04:45.043 --> 01:04:46.043
I'm James.

01:04:46.573 --> 01:04:47.573
Severin.

01:04:52.708 --> 01:04:53.708
What is that?

01:04:54.376 --> 01:04:55.376
It's my film.

01:04:57.756 --> 01:04:58.956
What is it about?

01:05:02.311 --> 01:05:04.051
I have a hard time saying.

01:05:05.466 --> 01:05:07.038
Are you showing it here tonight?

01:05:09.487 --> 01:05:10.487
I don't know.

01:05:11.478 --> 01:05:13.488
What are you guys doing in there?

01:05:15.098 --> 01:05:16.098
I hate him.

01:05:17.901 --> 01:05:19.475
He can be a lot worse.

01:05:21.211 --> 01:05:22.211
At least he's cute.

01:05:23.225 --> 01:05:24.589
That's pretty unusual.

01:05:26.291 --> 01:05:27.553
What's pretty unusual?

01:05:28.790 --> 01:05:30.940
I never had a john that cute.

01:05:38.086 --> 01:05:40.031
You know how we got started?

01:05:40.066 --> 01:05:41.066
How?

01:05:41.067 --> 01:05:45.529
After watching "My own private Idaho".

01:05:45.564 --> 01:05:47.500
I grew up in a small town, so I didn't know where to go.

01:05:49.411 --> 01:05:52.384
So I waited outside the theater where it was playing.

01:05:52.385 --> 01:05:55.097
I waited for somebody to come out.

01:05:55.625 --> 01:05:56.625
And that's where I met my first john.

01:05:57.733 --> 01:05:59.254
So was it choice?

01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:02.150
Yeah.

01:06:04.387 --> 01:06:06.022
I loved it actually.

01:06:07.661 --> 01:06:10.149
I knew exactly what I was worth.

01:06:10.704 --> 01:06:11.704
You know?

01:06:13.064 --> 01:06:15.290
Exactly what I had to contribute.

01:06:15.985 --> 01:06:18.926
What was like, the most you ever made in a day?

01:06:21.757 --> 01:06:24.211
Well, with cab fare--

01:06:24.212 --> 01:06:25.212
$389.

01:06:28.945 --> 01:06:31.680
That's pretty good for a small town.

01:06:35.128 --> 01:06:37.612
You're with that guy who looks just like you, right?

01:06:37.613 --> 01:06:38.613
Yeah.

01:06:40.356 --> 01:06:42.307
He's cute. He looks like a jelly bean.

01:06:44.021 --> 01:06:45.021
Yeah.

01:06:47.028 --> 01:06:48.780
He's great, actually.

01:06:53.436 --> 01:06:55.474
I never let him fuck me.

01:06:57.594 --> 01:07:00.284
I never let anybody fuck me.

01:07:08.276 --> 01:07:10.187
What are you guys doing in there?

01:07:17.214 --> 01:07:17.417
You're an artist.

01:07:18.303 --> 01:07:19.494
No. I suck.

01:07:20.199 --> 01:07:21.556
Hey, me too.

01:07:23.593 --> 01:07:25.773
Do you take that camera everywhere you go?

01:07:25.774 --> 01:07:26.774
Yeah, something like that.

01:07:38.339 --> 01:07:39.339
Are you OK?

01:07:46.244 --> 01:07:47.883
Why are you crying?

01:07:56.227 --> 01:08:00.206
I look back to things that were when I was 12 years old.

01:08:02.357 --> 01:08:05.159
I'm still looking for the same things now.

01:08:15.831 --> 01:08:17.764
Time's up.

01:08:24.071 --> 01:08:25.571
Hey, what are you doing?

01:08:25.572 --> 01:08:26.572
I'm looking for my husband.

01:08:26.573 --> 01:08:28.328
I just found mine.

01:08:28.363 --> 01:08:32.826
Both of them. I'm totally in love with them. 
But together. Not so much separately.

01:08:32.827 --> 01:08:34.911
 I hope they know it's gonna have to be a monogamous relationship.
- Excuse me.

01:08:36.548 --> 01:08:38.236
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

01:08:38.237 --> 01:08:39.152
Who are you?

01:08:39.153 --> 01:08:40.198
Who the fuck are <i>you</i> ?

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.721
I'm Ceth. Is there a problem?

01:08:41.723 --> 01:08:42.723
You're not funny.

01:08:42.724 --> 01:08:43.724
I thought it was kinda funny.

01:08:43.725 --> 01:08:46.715
No you're not. And you're a horrible therapist.

01:08:46.716 --> 01:08:49.389
Listen to me: James and Jamie are perfect.

01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:50.390
Just leave them alone.

01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:51.390
I think you need to leave.

01:08:51.392 --> 01:08:53.621
No. I think you're fucking with something very pivotal to them and to me.

01:08:53.622 --> 01:08:54.622
Just walk away!

01:08:54.622 --> 01:08:55.622
Fuck you!

01:08:55.624 --> 01:08:56.624
You motherfucker!

01:08:56.625 --> 01:08:57.625
OK, OK.

01:09:00.022 --> 01:09:01.022
Timeout, timeout.

01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:03.839
Sorry, I--

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:07.612
Are you OK?

01:09:07.647 --> 01:09:09.984
I've got an egg vibrating between my legs!

01:09:29.808 --> 01:09:30.808
What the fuck is going on in here?

01:09:32.216 --> 01:09:34.917
Hey. Are you OK?

01:09:36.702 --> 01:09:37.702
You gave it away?

01:09:37.703 --> 01:09:38.703
I just misplaced it.

01:09:39.698 --> 01:09:40.390
I know you're hurt.

01:09:40.425 --> 01:09:42.903
I am not hurt. I am furious!

01:09:42.904 --> 01:09:45.984
I totally honor your feelings, but I want you to own them.

01:09:45.986 --> 01:09:47.814
Shut up with your "honoring your feelings". 
And do not tell me what to own.

01:09:47.849 --> 01:09:50.640
Because I know what I own, 

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:53.166
you balding impotent liar!

01:09:53.167 --> 01:09:55.093
Right, sister!

01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:59.847
All right, show's over. 
We're gonna be processing to the next room now.

01:10:01.492 --> 01:10:02.492
Hey.

01:10:24.942 --> 01:10:27.798
Fuck! Fuck!

01:12:57.743 --> 01:12:59.535
Yes. I--I need an ambulance.

01:12:59.570 --> 01:13:01.988
I'm at the Palestra Gym. It's on 99...

01:14:28.239 --> 01:14:29.239
Hello?

01:14:29.661 --> 01:14:31.134
Who is this?

01:14:34.237 --> 01:14:37.027
Oh. Hey. How are you?

01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:40.288
Do I know you?

01:14:42.291 --> 01:14:43.291
No.

01:14:46.239 --> 01:14:48.143
Did you follow me?

01:14:49.810 --> 01:14:52.149
Why would you wanna do that to yourself?

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:59.657
James-- Yes, I followed you to the gym.

01:15:05.516 --> 01:15:07.554
Why?

01:15:07.555 --> 01:15:09.979
Let's not talk about this on the phone.

01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:12.021
What does your afternoon look like?

01:15:14.719 --> 01:15:19.944
I'm looking for a friend. His last name is Baysin.

01:15:21.312 --> 01:15:22.312
B-A-Y-

01:15:24.492 --> 01:15:26.565
What do you mean, he checked himself out?

01:15:27.909 --> 01:15:29.345
So what do you want?

01:15:29.346 --> 01:15:32.222
I want to be restrained, but I don't want to totally lose control.

01:15:32.223 --> 01:15:33.306
Good.

01:15:33.341 --> 01:15:35.769
'Cause I can't be bothered to tie you up.

01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:39.253
Turn over and hold the headbar. If you let go, I'll leave.

01:15:44.175 --> 01:15:45.994
You never asked your wife to do this?

01:15:46.828 --> 01:15:48.569
I guess she wouldn't understand.

01:15:49.146 --> 01:15:50.146
All right.

01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:53.294
This one's for her.

01:15:58.731 --> 01:16:01.702
And I told Brad, "I think you're confusing me with someone who hurt you."

01:16:03.008 --> 01:16:07.994
And he said, "No, Cheryl, you're hurting me."

01:16:10.508 --> 01:16:11.508
Right?

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:15.216
And that was an eye opener for me.

01:16:18.442 --> 01:16:21.621
And whenever I brought up my gastrointestinal problem...

01:16:37.784 --> 01:16:39.473
When did you start watching me?

01:16:42.178 --> 01:16:43.939
Um, a couple of years ago.

01:16:46.006 --> 01:16:47.968
I work right out of here. 

01:16:47.969 --> 01:16:49.754
I proofread for a living.

01:16:51.581 --> 01:16:53.065
I don't have cable.

01:16:53.066 --> 01:16:55.818
I remember watching Jamie cut your hair.

01:16:59.378 --> 01:17:01.312
It just seemed like fun.

01:17:02.659 --> 01:17:04.600
And you were always my favorite,

01:17:04.601 --> 01:17:06.546
because you were sad.

01:17:09.130 --> 01:17:10.719
Do you have a boyfriend?

01:17:11.713 --> 01:17:15.255
Look, James, please, you have to call Jamie, OK?

01:17:15.256 --> 01:17:16.256
Just call him.

01:17:16.257 --> 01:17:17.257
You can use my phone.

01:17:31.185 --> 01:17:33.409
Why won't he come home?

01:17:34.584 --> 01:17:36.543
Wouldn't you wanna go home?

01:18:17.623 --> 01:18:19.812
What are you doing?

01:18:22.095 --> 01:18:23.770
I don't understand?

01:18:26.116 --> 01:18:28.304
What are you doing here?

01:18:30.174 --> 01:18:32.580
Explain it to me, please.

01:18:34.098 --> 01:18:37.235
First you bring Ceth into the relationship--

01:18:37.236 --> 01:18:38.236
What's wrong with you?

01:18:39.095 --> 01:18:40.975
I didn't want Jamie to be alone.

01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:45.213
How long have you been planning this?

01:18:47.427 --> 01:18:51.617
What, so you've been making a suicide tape for the last six months?

01:18:52.532 --> 01:18:54.950
I just wanted him to know it wasn't his fault.

01:18:57.839 --> 01:18:59.361
Jamie loves you.

01:19:01.589 --> 01:19:03.044
You have so much.

01:19:06.142 --> 01:19:07.142
I know.

01:19:09.717 --> 01:19:11.818
I see it all around me.

01:19:14.805 --> 01:19:16.860
But it stops at my skin.

01:19:19.212 --> 01:19:21.240
I can't let it inside.

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:25.396
It's always been like that.

01:19:26.714 --> 01:19:29.074
It's always gonna be like that.

01:19:31.536 --> 01:19:34.520
I can feel it in little moments with Jamie,

01:19:34.555 --> 01:19:36.594
because he loves me so hard.

01:19:39.016 --> 01:19:42.853
He loves me as hard as the people who treated me like shit.

01:19:48.397 --> 01:19:49.397
I can't feel it.

01:19:51.925 --> 01:19:52.925
Don't.

01:19:55.207 --> 01:19:56.207
Don't. Don't. No.

01:19:57.901 --> 01:19:58.901
No. No.

01:20:02.293 --> 01:20:04.612
Go! Go!

01:20:06.482 --> 01:20:08.551
Don't you see that I don't wanna be this!

01:20:09.086 --> 01:20:11.317
... if that makes people uncomfortable, then it makes us uncomfortable.

01:20:13.662 --> 01:20:15.862
But at least it's truthful.

01:20:16.291 --> 01:20:17.954
I don't want to lie any more.

01:20:17.955 --> 01:20:20.805
Because that isn't who I am, and it isn't who I'm trying to, who we're trying to be.

01:21:48.422 --> 01:21:50.769
I have to get some sort of information,

01:21:50.770 --> 01:21:54.872
because the patient that was there checked himself out.

01:21:54.907 --> 01:21:56.061
Ceth!

01:23:10.177 --> 01:23:11.910
Are you sure?

01:24:05.999 --> 01:24:09.417
Be glad you followed me out into the fucking cold
and bucked a date

01:24:09.452 --> 01:24:11.510
so you could feel something?

01:24:12.604 --> 01:24:15.274
It's hard not to feel anything in your life.

01:24:15.309 --> 01:24:17.250
Do you feel it now, you little faggot?

01:24:53.791 --> 01:24:55.665
Don't you fucking look at me. 

01:24:56.312 --> 01:24:58.186
Don't fucking look at me!

01:25:05.443 --> 01:25:06.443
It's OK.

01:26:50.332 --> 01:26:53.983
"... is doing everything possible to get some power back,

01:26:53.984 --> 01:26:57.611
"and he's advising calm, which seems unnecessary,

01:26:57.646 --> 01:27:01.239
"because there's been no reported incidents of looting or violence of any kind.

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:04.000
"So far, no explanation for what caused the...

01:27:04.033 --> 01:27:07.135
I'm out to get some fruit and some batteries. 
I'll be back in five minutes.

01:27:07.882 --> 01:27:11.416
"... no reason to believe that this is the result of terrorist acts..."
