"America's Next Top Model"
is brand new

00:04.004 --> 00:06.239
and all about
being a boss.

00:07.574 --> 00:08.909
Your face is epic.

00:08.909 --> 00:10.543
This one is about
being the character.

00:10.543 --> 00:13.180
It's all about that
connection you have with the
camera.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.315
If I call your name,
you have what it takes

00:15.315 --> 00:18.151
to be the next top model.

00:18.151 --> 00:20.187
I can't wait
'til you guys get eliminated.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.321
Good luck with that.

00:21.321 --> 00:22.756
I've been trying to prove
to all my friends

00:22.756 --> 00:24.258
that white
people are good.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.992
You just don't look like a model
to me right here.

00:25.992 --> 00:27.728
You don't look
like a model to me right now.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.929
That attitude
is not going to succeed.

00:29.929 --> 00:32.166
Next photo shoot, I
promise you, I'm gonna kill it.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.667
You stupid ass bitch.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.303
I'm not (bleep)
talking to you!

00:36.303 --> 00:38.138
Who stays and who goes?

00:38.138 --> 00:39.573
Somebody get help!

00:39.573 --> 00:41.975
♪♪♪

00:58.159 --> 01:01.328
My name is Marissa.
I am 18 years old.

01:01.328 --> 01:02.663
I'm from Houston, Texas.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.932
My nickname
from anyone that meets me

01:04.932 --> 01:07.167
is always Mouth
of the South.

01:07.167 --> 01:09.069
I've been watching "Top Model"
since it came out.

01:09.069 --> 01:12.205
I was once that little girl
that wanted to be doing this

01:12.205 --> 01:15.275
but growing up, statistics
were definitely against me.

01:15.275 --> 01:19.379
I had a teen mom, my mom was
15 years old when she had me

01:19.379 --> 01:22.048
and that just made me all in all
a stronger person.

01:24.484 --> 01:26.253
I'm Justine.
I'm 18 years old

01:26.253 --> 01:28.422
and I'm from Los Angeles,
California.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.923
Ever since I was
a little kid,

01:29.923 --> 01:33.727
I've been watching
"America's Next Top Model."

01:33.727 --> 01:35.328
It's been my dream
to be on the show.

01:35.328 --> 01:36.896
I just graduated high school.

01:36.896 --> 01:39.566
My parents are very,
very strict.

01:39.566 --> 01:41.135
I've never been anywhere
by myself,

01:41.135 --> 01:43.270
so the fact
that I'm in New York,

01:43.270 --> 01:46.540
the fact that I'm about to start
my real modeling career,

01:46.540 --> 01:47.941
it's a dream come true.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.480
Cherish Waters was born
to be cherished.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.715
I really wanted to become
a model when I was younger,

01:55.715 --> 01:58.418
because I was
the only redhead at school

01:58.418 --> 02:00.654
and I was made fun of every day,

02:00.654 --> 02:02.990
but sticks and stones
may break your bones,

02:02.990 --> 02:04.791
but, bitch,
you don't even faze me.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.298
My name is Binta.
I was born in Gambia.

02:11.298 --> 02:14.467
I am a model, an activist
and an entrepreneur.

02:14.467 --> 02:19.173
Activist because I'm a
fighter. I was naturally born
with that.

02:19.173 --> 02:21.374
This is not something that
someone from where I came from

02:21.374 --> 02:24.778
experienced, not at all.
I'm gonna make my people proud.

02:24.778 --> 02:27.614
I am here to win
"America's Next Top Model."

02:30.283 --> 02:31.652
My name is Giah.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.722
I am 21 years old
and I'm a country girl.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.623
Hey, y'all!
Welcome to the country!

02:36.623 --> 02:39.026
I never thought I would
ever come to New York.

02:39.026 --> 02:41.628
I grew up with horses
everywhere,

02:41.628 --> 02:45.132
chickens running around in my
grandpa's yard, he has pigs.

02:45.132 --> 02:47.968
At the age of eight years old,
I started modeling.

02:47.968 --> 02:51.138
My grandmother would make
a pathway out of dirt

02:51.138 --> 02:53.941
and she put a book on my
head and she was my trainer,

02:53.941 --> 02:57.110
and I told her,
I'm gonna be something one day.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.351
We go into this venue.

03:04.351 --> 03:07.187
I'm like, ooh,
what's gonna happen?

03:07.187 --> 03:09.623
(Tyra)
I was once a little girl
with a dream.

03:12.726 --> 03:15.695
<i>And now, I'm sharing
that dream with you.</i>

03:25.506 --> 03:28.008

Work the runway ♪

03:34.715 --> 03:38.251
In front of my face
is <i>the</i> Tyra Banks!

03:38.251 --> 03:40.187
♪ Work the runway,
Work the runway ♪

03:40.187 --> 03:42.689
It was an out-of-body
experience.

03:42.689 --> 03:45.191
She was like
a real-life Barbie Doll.

03:47.061 --> 03:50.363
Welcome
to "America's Next Top Model."

03:50.363 --> 03:52.232
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

03:52.232 --> 03:56.002
Do we understand where the
modeling industry is right now?

03:56.002 --> 03:58.038
I'm not looking
for a traditional model

03:58.038 --> 04:01.308
and I'm not looking
for a social media model.

04:01.308 --> 04:04.578
I'm looking for both.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.080
Tyra Banks,
she's the quintessential

04:07.080 --> 04:09.416
meaning of a boss.
She's smart,

04:09.416 --> 04:12.853
she's a businesswoman,
she built this whole empire

04:12.853 --> 04:15.021
from the ground up
and that's amazing.

04:15.021 --> 04:19.159
I selected all 28 of you out
of thousands of model hopefuls.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.595
Who's strong enough
to create their own squad?

04:21.595 --> 04:24.965
Screw being in somebody else's
squad, your own squad.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.767
Who's strong enough for that?

04:26.767 --> 04:30.838
I've been watching "Top
Model" since I was 13 years old

04:30.838 --> 04:34.808
and now that I'm here,
it's insane.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.977
A personal brand is so important

04:36.977 --> 04:40.013
and I really worked
my entire career

04:40.013 --> 04:41.749
to make sure that I can be
in control of my destiny

04:41.749 --> 04:43.584
and be my own boss,

04:43.584 --> 04:46.686
that I was about beauty,
business and badassery.

04:46.686 --> 04:48.022
Not just about a pretty picture.

04:48.022 --> 04:49.990
Me being able to create
a personal brand

04:49.990 --> 04:53.193
has allowed me to step aside
and let "Top Model" continue

04:53.193 --> 04:55.429
to live while I continue
to make more opportunity

04:55.429 --> 04:57.330
for women just like you.

04:57.330 --> 05:01.502
And ladies, this cycle,
we'll have brand-new judges.

05:01.502 --> 05:05.472
I won't be here.
But I will be watching you.

05:05.472 --> 05:08.142
And it up to you all to go
into that judging room

05:08.142 --> 05:11.412
every single week
and make me proud,

05:11.412 --> 05:15.049
so to make sure you are ready,
I'm sending you to shoot a photo

05:15.049 --> 05:17.384
that is gonna be used
to create your comp card

05:17.384 --> 05:22.189
and then you will head
to meet the new panel.

05:22.189 --> 05:23.490
See you guys there.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.759
There is no time
for dilly-dallying.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.827
We are getting right
into the competition.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.367
Nice to meet you, I'm Paige.

05:34.367 --> 05:35.636
Massimo,
nice to meet you.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.138
Nice to meet you.
All right.

05:38.138 --> 05:41.742
Ooh, I'm already in the
zone. You better be.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.211
Beautiful.
Nice.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.313
Look at me, look at me.
Look through the lens.

05:46.313 --> 05:47.715
I am a signed model.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.983
I've done various
commercial print work.

05:49.983 --> 05:52.152
New York City is where
the real models are.

05:52.152 --> 05:55.055
This is the real deal,
real castings, real shoots,

05:55.055 --> 05:57.757
so I'm just excited to take it
to the next level.

05:57.757 --> 05:59.426
Nice long poses.

05:59.426 --> 06:00.995
In addition to being a model,

06:00.995 --> 06:03.163
I do have my own business
called Skin Buttr.

06:03.163 --> 06:06.233
It's body products, body
scrubs, body butter.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.269
I feel very accomplished.

06:08.269 --> 06:09.235
Thank you, Tatiana.

06:14.575 --> 06:15.709
Beautiful, beautiful.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.210
Thank you.
You're welcome.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.983
So we arrived
at Blade Helipad

06:22.983 --> 06:25.419
and I'm like, are we meeting
the judges today?

06:25.419 --> 06:26.954
Who are the judges?

06:26.954 --> 06:29.756
I'm so confused but so excited
at the same time.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.391
Me and my sister
have just been working

06:31.391 --> 06:32.592
really, really hard on this.

06:32.592 --> 06:34.561
We are our own
little mini squad.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.929
We've got each
other's backs.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.797
(woman 2)
I'm not playing any games.

06:37.797 --> 06:39.399
You mess with her,
you mess with me.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.400
Two against one.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.602
We are identical twins,

06:41.602 --> 06:42.937
but we're still
two different people,

06:42.937 --> 06:45.906
I mean, other girls might
be intimidated by it,

06:45.906 --> 06:48.108
and I'm sorry that both
of us are extremely fly.

06:54.782 --> 06:57.217
Helicopters are
everywhere, just flying,

06:57.217 --> 07:00.721
my hair is blowing in the
wind. And we're like, who is it?

07:00.721 --> 07:01.821
Who could this be?

07:11.565 --> 07:13.133
(screaming)

07:13.133 --> 07:15.202
Rita.

07:15.202 --> 07:18.939
She's played the game
and she's our host.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.877
She's a singer, actress, model.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.513
She's a fashion icon.
Perfect.

07:26.513 --> 07:28.448
This competition is revamped.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.783
What I hope
the girls learn

07:29.783 --> 07:32.886
is how to be a 25-year-old boss,
like me.

07:32.886 --> 07:35.522
I know how to sell.
I know how to create a brand

07:35.522 --> 07:38.625
and I know how to have
multiple business ventures.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.128
I'm here representing
a 360 overall.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.197
The model of today
has to be a boss,

07:43.197 --> 07:46.733
has to be able to act, move,
have a following.

07:46.733 --> 07:48.469
We're gonna find a star,
you guys.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.103
Aah!

07:54.174 --> 07:58.312
When Ashley Graham stepped
out, I'm like, oh, crap.

07:58.312 --> 08:02.850
She's a supermodel, a designer,
a boss and a brand.

08:02.850 --> 08:05.352
(Rita)
Ashley is my sexy, curvy model.

08:05.352 --> 08:09.089
She's gonna come and bring
confidence to these girls.

08:09.089 --> 08:12.559
She's gonna make them know
that tits and a butt is okay.

08:12.559 --> 08:15.395
I believe I'm living proof
that there is no one standard

08:15.395 --> 08:19.066
of beauty anymore
and I don't even really remember

08:19.066 --> 08:21.001
how many magazine covers
I've been on now.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.044
(Rita)
Drew, my great friend,

08:30.044 --> 08:33.947
is the chief creative officer
at "Paper" Magazine.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.016
He just has these amazing ideas

08:36.016 --> 08:38.685
that I know is gonna shake up
this show.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.521
I don't sugarcoat
anything.

08:40.521 --> 08:42.722
I am not here
to be your best friend.

08:46.861 --> 08:48.762
Law is a
celebrity stylist.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.365
He's worked
with so many amazing artists,

08:51.365 --> 08:53.267
from Zendaya to Celine Dion.

08:53.267 --> 08:55.835
(Rita)
Law is the image architect
to the stars.

08:55.835 --> 08:58.839
He's gonna bring realness.
He'll tell you how it is

08:58.839 --> 09:00.474
and he'll also make sure
you burn your clothes

09:00.474 --> 09:01.741
if they're not cute.

09:01.741 --> 09:03.276
When you walk into a room,

09:03.276 --> 09:04.577
personal style
is part of your calling card.

09:04.577 --> 09:07.080
It's just as important
as your face.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.850
I know you guys just got here,
Sorry, but not sorry,

09:09.850 --> 09:12.152
but we're about to throw you
straight into the deep end.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.088
We're gonna split you
into two groups

09:14.088 --> 09:16.924
and send you straight
to go-sees.

09:16.924 --> 09:20.261
What? I ain't never been
to a go-see in my life.

09:20.261 --> 09:22.929
And you'll be meeting
two celebrity designers.

09:22.929 --> 09:26.800
And it all starts with making
an amazing first impression.

09:26.800 --> 09:30.638
Half of you head uptown
to meet designer Philipp Plein,

09:30.638 --> 09:32.072
and the other half
will head to Queens

09:32.072 --> 09:35.609
to meet luxury designer
LaQuan Smith.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.344
And you ladies
better own it,

09:37.344 --> 09:39.947
because these designers
are gonna be the ones

09:39.947 --> 09:43.283
that help us decide
who stays in New York City

09:43.283 --> 09:44.919
and who goes home.

09:44.919 --> 09:47.320
(Rita)
And remember, there's 28
of you now,

09:47.320 --> 09:49.756
but only 14 will be finalists.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.925
And we created comp cards
for each of you,

09:51.925 --> 09:53.694
so that you'll have
something to leave behind.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.597
Good luck
and we'll see you later.

09:56.597 --> 10:00.033
Right from the start, you
need to be model-ready, ready to
go.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.735
I love that.

10:09.143 --> 10:11.612
So we get to the go-see.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.947
My group went to see
LaQuan Smith.

10:13.947 --> 10:17.084
And the other girls
went to see Philipp Plein.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.152
Welcome, ladies,
how are we doing today?

10:19.152 --> 10:22.156
Philipp Plein, he is an
amazing German designer.

10:22.156 --> 10:25.125
He has worked
with Naomi Campbell, Snoop Dogg.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.795
His stuff is really,
really high-end.

10:28.795 --> 10:32.466
You have to have certain
attributes to be a top model.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.667
How tall are you?

10:33.667 --> 10:34.735
I'm
five-eleven-and-a-half.

10:34.735 --> 10:35.836
(Philipp)
You know, mother nature

10:35.836 --> 10:37.571
is not always fair
to all of us.

10:37.571 --> 10:39.005
A bird will never
become a tiger,

10:39.005 --> 10:40.741
or a tiger will
never become a bird.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.342
I grew up watching
the show, you know,

10:42.342 --> 10:43.777
I was really
into everybody.

10:46.913 --> 10:49.683
You don't waste your time
putting a dress on a girl

10:49.683 --> 10:51.285
when I already know
that she will not fit in.

10:51.285 --> 10:54.655
I mean, that's the
industry. That's the game.

10:54.655 --> 10:57.758
Hello, Coryanne.
Why you're here?

10:57.758 --> 10:59.760
In LA, I usually do
a lot of commercial stuff,

10:59.760 --> 11:01.662
so this is, like,
an opportunity

11:01.662 --> 11:03.663
to do more high fashion,
edgy, you know.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.232
Did you ever do a catwalk?
Yeah.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.334
♪♪♪

11:07.334 --> 11:11.638
Cory, let's try, please,
again, because it was terrible.

11:11.638 --> 11:13.340
It was horrible.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.175
(Coryanne)
It's our first real challenge.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.677
I'm having a hard time
breathing.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.814
It's called "Top Model,"
not flop model.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.749
Philipp Plein
is very intimidating

11:22.749 --> 11:24.852
and it made the competition
feel very real.

11:24.852 --> 11:28.555
You have only one chance
to make it right.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.890
Come on!

11:30.890 --> 11:32.659
(man)
She wants it so bad.

11:32.659 --> 11:33.827
(Philipp)
You're not a horse.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.896
What are you giving
right now?

11:35.896 --> 11:37.164
Your walk is so together.

11:37.164 --> 11:38.832
I'm gonna give
you some water

11:38.832 --> 11:40.600
to nourish those Chia Pets
on your eyebrows.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.069
Stop it!
That's so mean.

11:43.069 --> 11:46.707
(Rita)
Ladies, we are looking
for models

11:46.707 --> 11:50.076
who can be the
undeniable boss.

11:50.076 --> 11:51.978
It's not just about
a pretty face anymore.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.090
(Tatiana)
When I saw LaQuan Smith's
name on the door,

12:03.090 --> 12:06.593
I instantly freaked out.
I am such a fan of his work.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.929
His stuff is everywhere.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.164
I actually ordered
one of his dresses.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.499
He's just amazing.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.202
Yeah, I'm LaQuan.
Nice to meet you.

12:15.202 --> 12:18.071
I want to be able
to celebrate a woman's body.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.774
That is the beauty
of the LaQuan Smith brand.

12:20.774 --> 12:23.376
You know, she walks into the
room and she commands attention.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.412
I love it.
I absolutely love you.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.481
Oh, my God.
I ordered
your... top.

12:27.481 --> 12:30.417
You better work.
Yes. I love you.

12:30.417 --> 12:34.155
I saw your name,
I'm like, yes!

12:34.155 --> 12:38.092
I instantly fall in love with
women that already know my work

12:38.092 --> 12:40.627
or that has even worn
a LaQuan Smith dress,

12:40.627 --> 12:42.896
they understand the power
of what that really truly means.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.932
Binta, let me
see you walk.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.766
Amazing.

12:46.766 --> 12:51.439
Binta just exudes confidence
and sensuality

12:51.439 --> 12:53.406
and I think that
that is the aesthetic

12:53.406 --> 12:54.941
of the LaQuan Smith woman.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.580
Krislian, your walk
is so together.

12:59.580 --> 13:01.481
I really love it.
I really, really love it.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.885
I think in this competition,
they do want a model, obviously,

13:04.885 --> 13:08.122
but they also want a brand
and a business.

13:08.122 --> 13:10.958
I am my own brand, Krislian,
hello.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.494
And also, I want to become
a designer.

13:13.494 --> 13:14.995
I am an entrepreneur.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.963
I am starting my own
company, my own swimwear line.

13:16.963 --> 13:19.532
This is my one shot
to really take it

13:19.532 --> 13:21.302
to the next level
with my career.

13:21.302 --> 13:22.802
Thank you.
Absolutely.

13:25.605 --> 13:26.506
Where are you from?
Seattle.

13:26.506 --> 13:27.974
Seattle?
Yes.

13:27.974 --> 13:31.144
I am a rocker chick.
I love music, I love sports.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.313
I'm hoping people
won't see me as competition

13:33.313 --> 13:37.351
due to my easygoing personality.
And then I'll just...

13:37.351 --> 13:38.819
get 'em
when they least expect it.

13:38.819 --> 13:39.719
Perfect.

13:41.454 --> 13:44.958
That looks really
like a duck.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.659
You're not here
to look like a duck.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.161
You're here to look
like a princess.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.664
That's your job right now.
Nothing else.

13:50.664 --> 13:51.999
Giah, how tall are you?

13:51.999 --> 13:54.301
I'm five-six
and seven-eighths.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.470
You're not a horse.
Come on.

13:56.470 --> 13:57.637
I need self-confidence.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.306
When you lift your legs up
like this,

13:59.306 --> 14:01.941
it looks strange.

14:01.941 --> 14:03.610
Hi, I'm Arreyon.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.045
What are you giving
right now?

14:05.045 --> 14:09.216
I am giving you Storm,
Sasha Fierce.

14:09.216 --> 14:13.554
I eat, dream, live,
breathe, everything fashion and
modeling.

14:13.554 --> 14:15.555
Just throw on this jacket
for me real quick,

14:15.555 --> 14:18.058
I just want to get
into your swag.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.927
(Laquan)
Arreyon, I think that she has
a great personality.

14:20.927 --> 14:23.397
But she came in with,
like, a bustier

14:23.397 --> 14:25.265
and crazy Avatar braid.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.767
I would advise her
to tone it all the way down.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.774
It was amazing.

14:33.774 --> 14:35.042
I see myself going very far.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.211
And so does the Lord,
hallelujah.

14:37.211 --> 14:38.212
How tall are you?

14:38.212 --> 14:39.546
Five-six, five-seven.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.015
I can rock anything
you give me.

14:41.015 --> 14:43.117
You can give me a bag,
I'll rock it for you.

14:43.117 --> 14:44.684
I love confidence.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.252
Everything is at
stake here for me.

14:46.252 --> 14:48.755
My credibility, everybody
who surrounded me has said,

14:48.755 --> 14:50.391
no, no, no, you
can't do this.

14:50.391 --> 14:52.126
I hear that,
even from my own father,

14:52.126 --> 14:54.394
and I can prove him wrong,
and that's what I'm here to do.

14:54.394 --> 14:58.098
(LaQuan)
I would consider using Starr
for social media,

14:58.098 --> 15:02.169
but for presentations
and runway shows, not so much.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.437
(Philipp)
Hello.

15:03.437 --> 15:05.272
You have two times
the same face,

15:05.272 --> 15:06.640
you have
two times the same body.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.976
How can someone decide
between left and right?

15:08.976 --> 15:10.744
Oh, they don't--
You don't decide.

15:10.744 --> 15:11.912
You take 'em both.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.680
Double trouble.
Yeah, exactly.

15:14.948 --> 15:17.017
I actually moved to New
York about a year ago,

15:17.017 --> 15:19.119
trying to find an agency,
and no luck.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.322
This is an opportunity to,
you know,

15:21.322 --> 15:23.123
make something
of yourself.

15:23.123 --> 15:26.427
I want to be a model
and I want to establish myself

15:26.427 --> 15:28.261
as a businesswoman
as well.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.763
Thank you.

15:29.763 --> 15:30.864
Tell me a little bit
about yourself.

15:30.864 --> 15:32.866
I love your style.
It's really edgy.

15:32.866 --> 15:34.268
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, I guess that's one

15:34.268 --> 15:35.903
of my main identifiers,
is that I'm androgynous.

15:35.903 --> 15:37.737
I love that.
I mean, I'm also gay.

15:37.737 --> 15:40.607
I've never felt fully,
like, one of the girls,

15:40.607 --> 15:42.409
I've never felt fully like
one of the boys.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.244
I'm okay with
being in between

15:44.244 --> 15:46.947
and I think it's cool
being genderqueer.

15:48.415 --> 15:51.985
I like Kyle,
I like her androgyny,

15:51.985 --> 15:53.754
but I don't think
that that would work

15:53.754 --> 15:55.122
for the LaQuan
Smith brand,

15:55.122 --> 15:57.758
but I think that her
edginess and her heart,

15:57.758 --> 16:00.260
her personality, it's
definitely a bright future for
her.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.895
(woman)
What was your first tattoo?

16:01.895 --> 16:04.698
The little one
right above that.
What does it say?

16:04.698 --> 16:08.301
It's a Latin proverb,
to be rather than to seem.

16:08.301 --> 16:12.072
Starr and Kyle are
definitely feeling each other

16:12.072 --> 16:14.841
in a couple hours
of knowing each other.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.248
Kyle.

16:21.248 --> 16:23.384
She's so cute, she's like,
my alter ego.

16:23.384 --> 16:25.018
She's like...
I don't know,

16:25.018 --> 16:27.187
as soon as I saw her, I was
like, I got little butterflies.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.989
Okay, Kyle, okay.
What-- what...

16:29.989 --> 16:32.526
(Kyle)
I guess I'm not that sneaky
with my flirting,

16:32.526 --> 16:34.027
but I think Starr
is pretty gorgeous.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.695
I hope she makes it
in the house,

16:35.695 --> 16:37.364
I hope I make it in the house,
'cause it would be nice

16:37.364 --> 16:39.666
to see where that goes, right?

16:39.666 --> 16:41.167
(Marissa)
Personally, I think that now

16:41.167 --> 16:44.004
is not really the appropriate
setting to be all trying

16:44.004 --> 16:46.740
to find a girlfriend,
but hey, whatever.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.508
Hi.
Hi!

16:48.508 --> 16:50.010
I'm Marissa.
Hi, Marissa.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.679
Nice to meet you.
Sorry I'm a little perspirated.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.315
(LaQuan)
Marissa, she's such a ball
of energy.

16:55.315 --> 16:56.850
I think she has a great walk.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.953
She's definitely a go
for the LaQuan Smith brand.

17:02.422 --> 17:06.426
There were a lot of girls
that had a lot of potential.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.762
Binta is, like, bomb.

17:08.762 --> 17:10.831
I can definitely see Binta
moving on

17:10.831 --> 17:14.001
to major campaigns
and doing a lot of stuff.

17:14.001 --> 17:16.770
I love Tatiana.
The shape of her face.

17:16.770 --> 17:20.708
She's just so striking,
too. She was amazing.

17:20.708 --> 17:23.410
Starr, she wants it so bad.
She does.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.746
She knows what she wants.
Driven.

17:25.746 --> 17:27.915
Kyle. I see this
going somewhere,

17:27.915 --> 17:30.417
I just think she needs
to kind of play up more

17:30.417 --> 17:32.653
on this androgynous
factor. Mm-hmm.

17:32.653 --> 17:34.588
I think we got a good
selection going.

17:34.588 --> 17:36.089
Absolutely, I agree.

17:43.063 --> 17:45.633
So what kind of girls
do you guys think

17:45.633 --> 17:47.534
they're looking for
this season? A boss.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.469
I think they really
want a variety.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.406
I see the twins and I
think the twins are beautiful,

17:53.406 --> 17:55.642
but I'm already over it.
Why?

17:55.642 --> 17:58.145
My brand is that I'm a twin.

17:58.145 --> 17:59.547
No shade.

17:59.547 --> 18:00.814
That's a lot of palm tree
right there,

18:00.814 --> 18:02.015
that's a lot of palm tree.

18:18.165 --> 18:21.101
Stop it, that's so mean.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.202
Hey, look.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.970
Listen, little girl,
don't cry.

18:23.970 --> 18:26.640
(Tatiana)
Courtney, her eyebrows
are really poppin'.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.808
People pay hundred dollars
to have eyebrows

18:28.808 --> 18:30.810
that look like hers,
so that was a low blow.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.985
We may be competition,
but nobody else

18:38.985 --> 18:40.720
is gonna be as mean
as you've been.

18:45.492 --> 18:49.162
Is this already happening?
Good God almighty.

18:49.162 --> 18:52.633
(Marissa)
I can't handle adults
that act like children.

18:52.633 --> 18:55.769
I'm here for my career
and there's just nothing

18:55.769 --> 18:57.938
that is gonna get in my way.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.911
(Rita)
This is gonna be the moment
of truth.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.947
Here we go.

19:06.947 --> 19:09.282
As a client, I would want
to book you right away

19:09.282 --> 19:13.353
and if I was up against
you, I'd be a little nervous.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.588
You can be a strong person
without being a bitch.

19:31.605 --> 19:35.342
Okay, guys.
It's beginning!

19:35.342 --> 19:36.610
This is so exciting.

19:36.610 --> 19:39.112
This brand-new
"America's Next Top Model"

19:39.112 --> 19:42.582
is about finding the star,
finding the sass,

19:42.582 --> 19:45.118
the businesswoman, everything
that we've discussed.

19:45.118 --> 19:47.954
I'm here representing
a business, a brand,

19:47.954 --> 19:50.524
a 360 overall, which is
why "America's Next Top Model"

19:50.524 --> 19:53.126
is brand-new and why
we're on this panel.

19:55.963 --> 19:57.965
I'm just wondering
what they're gonna say.

19:57.965 --> 19:59.432
Clearly,
somebody's going home.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.768
A lot of people are going home.

20:00.768 --> 20:02.102
(Giah)
We're in the holding room

20:02.102 --> 20:03.670
waiting to see
what happens next.

20:03.670 --> 20:07.007
I'm very nervous.
I'm literally (bleep) bricks.

20:07.007 --> 20:09.709
I just gotta make it
into the final 14.

20:10.911 --> 20:13.080
So, as you know,
we're looking for 14 girls

20:13.080 --> 20:16.349
and the one who has
the potential to be a true star.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.285
So the girls went
to go-sees yesterday

20:18.285 --> 20:20.287
and they had to make
a good first impression.

20:20.287 --> 20:23.290
We're judging off the comp card
that we made up for the girls.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.692
This is gonna be the moment
of truth.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.695
Bring on the first girl.

20:27.695 --> 20:29.295
Hi.

20:29.295 --> 20:30.230
(all)
Hi.

20:31.465 --> 20:32.766
My name is Marissa

20:32.766 --> 20:34.435
and I'm the youngest
of the competition,

20:34.435 --> 20:35.936
so that says a lot.

20:35.936 --> 20:38.605
And I'm the most talkative
too, so that also says a lot.

20:38.605 --> 20:41.442
Let's talk
about your background.

20:41.442 --> 20:42.776
Okay.
Oh, my God.

20:42.776 --> 20:44.377
I don't know
why I'm already--

20:44.377 --> 20:45.779
No.
It's okay.

20:45.779 --> 20:47.114
My mom had me at 15
and my dad

20:47.114 --> 20:49.516
has been incarcerated
my whole life.

20:49.516 --> 20:52.786
Everything I do is for my mom,
she had a really rough life

20:52.786 --> 20:55.789
and I probably made it,
like, three times harder,

20:55.789 --> 20:58.258
but I mean, she says
I saved her life, so.

20:58.258 --> 21:01.461
I migrated from my country
where I was born to London

21:01.461 --> 21:02.863
when I was one years old.

21:02.863 --> 21:04.531
My country was in the middle
of a warzone

21:04.531 --> 21:06.667
and my family
couldn't even speak English.

21:06.667 --> 21:08.835
And so we all have
background stories,

21:08.835 --> 21:10.304
and that's what this show
is about.

21:10.304 --> 21:12.305
This is a platform
for you to find yourself

21:12.305 --> 21:15.509
and give you a chance to
make yourself a better person.

21:15.509 --> 21:17.811
Thank you.
Okay?

21:17.811 --> 21:19.646
Let's talk about the go-sees.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.015
I met with LaQuan Smith.

21:21.015 --> 21:23.784
He did say that your walk
was dope and bomb.

21:23.784 --> 21:25.186
Oh, my God!

21:25.186 --> 21:27.187
So let's have a look
at your comp card.

21:27.187 --> 21:29.022
You ready?
Yes.

21:29.022 --> 21:30.023
Wow.
Hot.

21:30.023 --> 21:31.592
That's gorgeous.
Thank you.

21:31.592 --> 21:32.826
You have the attitude.

21:32.826 --> 21:34.495
I'm into that face,
that mug, mother.

21:34.495 --> 21:35.863
Those cheekbones?

21:35.863 --> 21:38.032
You know what?
You are a very stunning woman,

21:38.032 --> 21:40.133
but take the makeup off.
Okay.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.901
Pleasure to meet you.
Thank you.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.440
Hey, guys,
I'm Tatiana Elizabeth.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.743
I'm from Brooklyn, New
York, and I'm 21 years old.

21:49.743 --> 21:52.480
You impressed LaQuan, huh?
You knew a lot about him.

21:52.480 --> 21:53.780
Yes, I love LaQuan.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.515
Well, he loved you.
You were in his top three.

21:55.515 --> 21:58.251
It makes me proud
when a girl knows a little bit

21:58.251 --> 22:00.254
about every single part
of the industry,

22:00.254 --> 22:01.821
and that's where the boss
comes in at.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.758
And, like, I love a girl
that has a reference.

22:04.758 --> 22:07.160
Let's take a look
at your comp card.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.862
(Ashley)
If I got that as a client,

22:08.862 --> 22:10.397
I would want to book
you right away.

22:10.397 --> 22:13.767
And if I was up against you,
I'd be a little nervous.

22:13.767 --> 22:16.803
I think your brand is,
you know, that glow.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.004
Which I think
it beautiful.

22:18.004 --> 22:19.973
Well, thank you very much,
Tatiana.

22:19.973 --> 22:21.809
Thank you.
Good luck.

22:21.809 --> 22:24.211
Hi, my name is Paige,
I'm 22 years old

22:24.211 --> 22:26.213
and I hail
from Birmingham, Michigan.

22:26.213 --> 22:28.682
Right here on the Michigan map.
Okay.

22:28.682 --> 22:31.418
I am the definition
of a girl boss.

22:31.418 --> 22:35.255
I have been a competitive
dancer, I did pageants,

22:35.255 --> 22:37.657
I won the Presidential Award
from President Obama

22:37.657 --> 22:39.993
for community service
in high school.

22:39.993 --> 22:41.361
I went to school
for musical theater.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.197
I want to do something
in leadership.

22:43.197 --> 22:45.733
I also have plans
to start my own nonprofit,

22:45.733 --> 22:47.334
and on top of all of that,

22:47.334 --> 22:49.870
I want to be America's Next
Top Model, so I'm ready.

22:49.870 --> 22:51.638
So you're the girl
that I would hate in school.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.407
Yeah.
Uh...

22:53.407 --> 22:56.043
But we actually have a comp card
that we made up for you.

22:56.043 --> 22:56.977
Cool.

22:58.412 --> 22:59.580
There we go.

22:59.580 --> 23:01.048
That's what I
was looking for.

23:01.048 --> 23:03.817
Seriously, you have
a cover model face.

23:03.817 --> 23:07.487
So this is amazing still
image, but her very...

23:07.487 --> 23:08.655
It's very this show!

23:08.655 --> 23:11.124
We don't always want
that show,

23:11.124 --> 23:14.128
so I'm gonna need to have
multi dimensions of you.

23:14.128 --> 23:16.129
All right, Paige.
Well, thank you.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.934
Hello.
Hi, I'm Arreyon.

23:20.934 --> 23:22.936
I've been modeling
a few years now.

23:22.936 --> 23:24.905
I like to be different.

23:24.905 --> 23:25.872
Wow!

23:25.872 --> 23:27.774
So, I love to just stand out.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.443
I feel like standing out,
that's what a boss is,

23:29.443 --> 23:31.444
when you walk in a room, people
see you, they're like, okay.

23:31.444 --> 23:33.247
Yeah, but you don't have
to overdress that way.

23:33.247 --> 23:36.050
I think it's something
very beautiful and subtle

23:36.050 --> 23:37.584
about pulling back
a little bit.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.820
If you took the necklace off.
Okay.

23:39.820 --> 23:41.922
Wow! Your chest is glistening,
it's gorgeous.

23:41.922 --> 23:43.256
Yeah, now we see the neck.

23:43.256 --> 23:45.993
Okay, let's look
at your comp card.

23:45.993 --> 23:48.662
I wish I saw more
of your face.
Me too.

23:48.662 --> 23:50.230
Yeah, I like her, too.
I don't like the picture,

23:50.230 --> 23:52.166
but I do like you,
but I definitely think

23:52.166 --> 23:54.534
you need to be polished
just a little bit.

23:54.534 --> 23:56.937
Well, thank you.

23:56.937 --> 23:58.539
Tell me a bit
about your background.

23:58.539 --> 23:59.973
My parents are divorced,

23:59.973 --> 24:02.209
so I lived with my mom
my whole life.

24:02.209 --> 24:03.877
How's your relationship
with your mom?

24:03.877 --> 24:06.013
She doesn't really support
my modeling career.

24:06.013 --> 24:07.881
What did she say
when you left for New York?

24:09.650 --> 24:12.619
I actually didn't tell her.
What?

24:12.619 --> 24:15.355
I would beat your ass,
if I don't know where my kid is.

24:15.355 --> 24:18.058
Are you kidding me?
And you're in another city?

24:18.058 --> 24:20.560
Oh, girl, you're getting
grounded forever.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.796
Let's look at your comp card.

24:22.796 --> 24:24.898
Great hair, exotic,
amazing look.

24:24.898 --> 24:26.366
(Ashley)
Your neck looks a little broken,

24:26.366 --> 24:29.636
but you have a beautiful,
beautiful face.

24:29.636 --> 24:31.204
Thank you.
You're welcome.

24:31.204 --> 24:33.541
Thank you so, so much.
Thank you.

24:33.541 --> 24:35.842
Woo!
Hey, kooky queen.

24:35.842 --> 24:37.978
Tell us something that
you want us to know about you.

24:37.978 --> 24:39.713
I went into an agency
and he told me

24:39.713 --> 24:42.215
the only way for them to
sign me is if I got my top lip
done.

24:42.215 --> 24:44.551
I've been told to lose weight.
And if somebody told me

24:44.551 --> 24:48.856
to fill up my upper lip, I would
give them the middle finger.

24:48.856 --> 24:51.358
Let's take a look
at your comp card.

24:51.358 --> 24:54.561
This is fantastic.
That's what I'm talking about.

24:54.561 --> 24:56.130
You're yummy, you're beautiful.

24:56.130 --> 24:57.364
Thank you very much.

24:57.364 --> 24:58.298
Bye, Cherish.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.270
Can I just say,
you are hot.

25:03.270 --> 25:04.504
Thank you.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.273
You remind me
of Ruby Rose.

25:06.273 --> 25:08.208
Your characteristics
and your mannerisms.

25:08.208 --> 25:11.378
I would cast you in
"Paper" Magazine in two seconds.

25:11.378 --> 25:14.581
So let's go straight
to your comp card.

25:14.581 --> 25:19.753
This picture
is not as hot as you are.

25:19.753 --> 25:21.354
I don't think so.
I like it.

25:21.354 --> 25:25.225
I think that your face
is absolutely gorgeous.

25:25.225 --> 25:26.226
Well, thank you.

25:28.062 --> 25:29.797
You have such
beautiful features.

25:29.797 --> 25:30.864
What ethnicity are you?

25:30.864 --> 25:32.199
My dad's
from Northern Italy

25:32.199 --> 25:33.534
and my mom's
from Mississippi.

25:33.534 --> 25:34.902
Because I heard she
was a model.

25:34.902 --> 25:37.371
My mom, Stephanie Roberts,
she was, like,

25:37.371 --> 25:39.707
probably one of the biggest
supermodels in the '90s.

25:39.707 --> 25:42.176
She was up there with,
like, Tyra and Naomi.

25:42.176 --> 25:43.277
A legend, no doubt.

25:43.277 --> 25:44.945
Should we take a look
at her comp card?

25:44.945 --> 25:47.247
Hands down, to me
this is the best comp card

25:47.247 --> 25:49.082
that we've seen all day.
I think so.

25:49.082 --> 25:51.084
Thank you so much.
Good luck.

25:51.084 --> 25:52.953
That picture
was just to die for.

25:54.788 --> 25:57.258
Hi, guys. I like to talk
in a British accent.

25:57.258 --> 25:58.626
Let me see.
Go.

25:58.626 --> 26:00.127
Uh, 'ello, I'm Roxy, um...

26:00.127 --> 26:02.529
What?
Was that English?

26:02.529 --> 26:05.031
(singing indistinctly)

26:09.769 --> 26:11.839
I don't know
what just happened.

26:11.839 --> 26:13.140
You haven't been praised

26:13.140 --> 26:15.175
for your past achievements
growing up?

26:15.175 --> 26:18.812
Is this a lack of support
that you've had as a kid?
Yeah.

26:18.812 --> 26:22.016
I'm a trans woman,
and there's a lot of--

26:22.016 --> 26:24.651
There's a lot of things.
You know, I'm different,

26:24.651 --> 26:25.953
even though
I'm, you know, trans

26:25.953 --> 26:28.455
and maybe not everyone
understands that,

26:28.455 --> 26:31.191
there's still a place for me
and what I want to do.

26:31.191 --> 26:34.027
Quei has a strong,
strong personality.

26:34.027 --> 26:35.862
You have to,
like, not allow

26:35.862 --> 26:37.697
someone who's bullying you
to affect you.

26:37.697 --> 26:40.200
To me, people who pick on others
do it

26:40.200 --> 26:42.002
because they're insecure
within themselves.

26:47.841 --> 26:50.677
Okay.
Oh, God.

26:50.677 --> 26:52.812
Great.
So we were...

26:52.812 --> 26:55.015
All right, so...
Who are you talking about?

26:55.015 --> 27:00.153
We basically were just talking
about her feelings towards you.

27:00.153 --> 27:02.222
But not in a negative way.
Not in a negative way.

27:02.222 --> 27:04.024
We're talking about
positive things.

27:04.024 --> 27:07.060
I feel like we should be
joking around and having fun

27:07.060 --> 27:08.995
and not being bitches
to each other.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.997
Well, see,
I am a bitch, though,

27:10.997 --> 27:13.334
but I'm not gonna
be a bitch to you.

27:13.334 --> 27:16.736
You can be a strong person
without being a bitch.

27:19.039 --> 27:21.241
I'm sending you
to a VIP party,

27:21.241 --> 27:23.744
but not all of you
are gonna get in.

27:23.744 --> 27:24.878
Good luck.

27:24.878 --> 27:26.747
What's your first name?
Arreyon.

27:26.747 --> 27:27.981
Spell your name again.

27:33.554 --> 27:35.889
You can be a strong person
without being a bitch.

27:35.889 --> 27:37.891
Let's all be
happy and bubbly.

27:40.227 --> 27:43.597
Okay, so I am sarcastic.
You know, I said my--

27:43.597 --> 27:46.032
You know, my immature comments,
you know,

27:46.032 --> 27:47.401
and I'm sorry about that.

27:47.401 --> 27:49.703
We're gonna be here together
forever.

27:49.703 --> 27:53.907
So we might as well just--
We might as well just move on.

27:58.812 --> 28:00.547
Hi, Courtney.
Hello.

28:00.547 --> 28:02.549
I hear there was a bit of drama
going on.

28:02.549 --> 28:05.119
There was, there was
some mean girl action.

28:05.119 --> 28:07.387
Well, we do not tolerate
bullying at all

28:07.387 --> 28:09.123
on "America's Next Top Model."

28:09.123 --> 28:11.125
I think that I deserve to be
America's Next Top Model

28:11.125 --> 28:12.592
because I've had a lot
of obstacles

28:12.592 --> 28:14.228
and hardships in my life.

28:14.228 --> 28:17.931
When I was nine years old,
I was diagnoses with scoliosis.

28:17.931 --> 28:20.000
In my spine,
I have two rods that go

28:20.000 --> 28:22.536
from the top all the
way down to the bottom

28:22.536 --> 28:24.538
and then they took
bone graft from my hips,

28:24.538 --> 28:25.605
so I have half of a hip.

28:25.605 --> 28:27.108
I have a story
that needs to be told,

28:27.108 --> 28:28.775
I have passion that needs
to be felt,

28:28.775 --> 28:30.243
so I'm putting myself out there.

28:30.243 --> 28:32.780
I have been on my own
since I was 17 years old.

28:32.780 --> 28:34.448
My mom kicked me
out of the house.

28:34.448 --> 28:36.283
Who has been the person
that you've leaned on,

28:36.283 --> 28:37.284
that you've trusted?

28:37.284 --> 28:38.619
I haven't had anyone.

28:38.619 --> 28:41.621
You've never had anyone
to ask advice?

28:41.621 --> 28:45.058
Everything that I've
learned, I've learned on my own.

28:45.058 --> 28:48.762
I don't have the words to
describe how proud I am of you.
Thank you.

28:48.762 --> 28:52.433
So let's have a look
at your comp card.
Okay.

28:52.433 --> 28:54.701
Woo!
Come through with the comp card!

28:54.701 --> 28:57.204
You're so high-end,
you're so editorial.

28:57.204 --> 28:58.705
Thank you so much.
I love your eyebrows.

28:58.705 --> 29:00.940
The eyebrows
are everything.

29:00.940 --> 29:03.343
I love the masculinity,
actually.

29:03.343 --> 29:06.346
It's everything, it's
like, fresh and new and now.

29:06.346 --> 29:08.315
Thank you so much.
Good luck.

29:08.315 --> 29:13.220
I'm Krislian, I'm 25 and I
have somewhat of a dance
background.

29:13.220 --> 29:15.188
Like what kind of dance?

29:15.188 --> 29:18.125
I do music videos,
so, you know, I got rhythm.

29:18.125 --> 29:20.026
I'm Latina.
Oh, right.

29:20.026 --> 29:22.496
You sell sex,
is what I'm gathering.

29:22.496 --> 29:25.198
But is it gonna be a brand?
Where is that gonna take us?

29:25.198 --> 29:28.035
How important is social media
to you?

29:28.035 --> 29:29.503
I have 50,000
followers right now.

29:29.503 --> 29:31.004
On Instagram?
On Instagram.

29:31.004 --> 29:34.842
Okay. Let's take a look
at your comp card.

29:34.842 --> 29:37.144
She's giving the sex,
like...

29:37.144 --> 29:38.879
Is that an Instagram pose

29:38.879 --> 29:41.348
or is that meant to be
a comp card for a modeling book?

29:41.348 --> 29:44.184
You want to look
versatile all the time.

29:46.320 --> 29:47.554
Hi, India.

29:47.554 --> 29:48.989
Hey.
What's up?

29:48.989 --> 29:50.791
Have you had experience
in modeling before?

29:50.791 --> 29:52.026
Some international
stuff.

29:52.026 --> 29:53.193
Where have you been?

29:53.193 --> 29:55.162
Milan, Istanbul, Athens.

29:55.162 --> 29:56.630
Wow.
Why are you here?

29:56.630 --> 29:58.365
Well, to be honest,
I chose some of the markets

29:58.365 --> 30:01.836
that I did because of my
love to travel, not so much--

30:01.836 --> 30:05.506
I mean, for modeling, I should
have stuck to LA and New York.

30:05.506 --> 30:08.375
I'm a bit nervous
about your seriousness.

30:08.375 --> 30:09.809
Like, to be honest--
My seriousness?

30:09.809 --> 30:11.845
Yeah, like to come
in front of judges

30:11.845 --> 30:13.680
and say, oh,
you put your travels first

30:13.680 --> 30:15.983
and that type of thing,
like what's different today?

30:15.983 --> 30:17.851
I think she'll be the girl
who is like,

30:17.851 --> 30:20.054
I'm going to backpack
in South Africa.

30:20.054 --> 30:21.655
Like, she's that girl.

30:21.655 --> 30:23.690
So you went
to see Philipp Plein.
Yes, I did.

30:23.690 --> 30:25.325
He loved you.
Yay.

30:25.325 --> 30:28.529
Let's look at your comp card.

30:28.529 --> 30:33.033
I see an all-American girl
next door, cute and innocent,

30:33.033 --> 30:35.101
but I feel like there's
something we don't know,

30:35.101 --> 30:36.937
which I feel like we might
need to know later on.

30:36.937 --> 30:38.872
If you make it through.
Great.

30:38.872 --> 30:40.507
Good luck.
Thank you guys.

30:40.507 --> 30:42.009
My name is Binta Dibba.

30:42.009 --> 30:44.311
I am from Seattle,
Washington, and I am 25 years
old.

30:44.311 --> 30:45.512
You're not from
Seattle, Washington.

30:45.512 --> 30:47.948
I am originally from
Gambia, West Africa.

30:47.948 --> 30:49.516
LaQuan loved you.

30:49.516 --> 30:50.651
Ah...

30:50.651 --> 30:52.686
So he said he would book
you immediately, actually.

30:52.686 --> 30:54.654
Yeah, I love modeling,
you guys don't understand.

30:54.654 --> 30:56.356
This just makes sense
immediately, just--

30:56.356 --> 30:58.025
You can tell
in the body language.

30:58.025 --> 31:00.861
You're really giving me
that young vibe and that energy

31:00.861 --> 31:04.197
and it's so welcomed,
I think, right now.
Thank you.

31:04.197 --> 31:06.700
I'd love to see your comp.

31:06.700 --> 31:09.403
Your comp is good,
it's a little weak,

31:09.403 --> 31:11.405
because here,
you're fierce.

31:11.405 --> 31:13.740
I absolutely love it.
Binta, thank you.

31:13.740 --> 31:15.241
Bye, thank you.

31:17.911 --> 31:19.212
Twins.

31:20.580 --> 31:21.581
Well, hello.

31:21.581 --> 31:22.682
Hi.
Hi.

31:22.682 --> 31:24.084
I'm Tash.
I'm Cody.

31:24.084 --> 31:26.020
(both)
We are identical
twin sisters.

31:26.020 --> 31:28.055
We're 26 years old.

31:28.055 --> 31:29.690
And we're from San Jose,
California.

31:29.690 --> 31:30.691
Wow.

31:30.691 --> 31:31.958
Whoa.

31:31.958 --> 31:33.894
Have you guys done that before?

31:33.894 --> 31:35.028
Yeah.

31:35.028 --> 31:36.263
You went to see Philipp.

31:36.263 --> 31:37.965
Yes.
He liked both of you.

31:37.965 --> 31:41.301
I was so nervous and
sweating so bad, dude, like...

31:41.301 --> 31:42.736
It was so hot.
I had to, like,

31:42.736 --> 31:44.938
burn those underwear
that I had.

31:44.938 --> 31:47.040
It was that bad, you guys,
like...

31:47.040 --> 31:49.744
Let's take a look
at your comp cards.

31:49.744 --> 31:51.011
Is that Cody?
No!

31:51.011 --> 31:54.081
I was gonna say,
I was gonna say Tash.

31:54.081 --> 31:56.850
Tash. You're giving me
shoulders, girl.

31:56.850 --> 31:58.952
You're giving me elegance,
you're giving me pure beauty,

31:58.952 --> 32:00.353
I'm feeling it.

32:00.353 --> 32:02.856
Let's take a look
at Cody's card.

32:02.856 --> 32:04.024
I can see the difference.

32:04.024 --> 32:04.992
You can see the,
like, hardness

32:04.992 --> 32:06.293
come out
a little bit, right?

32:06.293 --> 32:08.495
This is scary.
You look--

32:08.495 --> 32:11.765
You look a little
frightening, if I'm honest.
Oh, no.

32:11.765 --> 32:13.433
Really?
I want to disagree.

32:13.433 --> 32:16.237
What I've been seeing
lately is this toughness

32:16.237 --> 32:18.905
and this androgyny
that a lot of designers

32:18.905 --> 32:21.307
have been booking,
so for me, I love it.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.977
Thank you.
It was lovely to meet you.

32:27.314 --> 32:29.350
Hello.
I'm Giah.

32:29.350 --> 32:31.751
I'm from Bryan-College
Station, Texas.

32:31.751 --> 32:33.787
Giah, you had a go-see
with Philipp Plein.

32:33.787 --> 32:36.156
How did that go?
He was very blunt,
he was serious.

32:36.156 --> 32:37.491
That's Philipp for you.

32:37.491 --> 32:39.026
That's all I'm
looking for is help.

32:39.026 --> 32:41.662
So let's take a look
at your comp card.

32:41.662 --> 32:42.863
Girl.

32:42.863 --> 32:45.032
You are all-American
gorgeous beauty.

32:45.032 --> 32:47.167
Thank you so much.
Y'all are my inspiration.

32:47.167 --> 32:50.938
I look at you on the
magazine and what you've done.

32:50.938 --> 32:52.906
Oh, don't make me cry.

32:52.906 --> 32:54.141
Y'all have something
that's special

32:54.141 --> 32:56.277
and I know y'all all
worked hard for it.

32:56.277 --> 32:57.244
Thank you.

32:57.244 --> 32:59.446
Thank you, Giah.
Thank you so much.

32:59.446 --> 33:02.249
It was great meeting
you guys.
Pleasure!

33:02.249 --> 33:04.551
I love her, I love her, I love
her, I love her, I love her.

33:08.855 --> 33:10.491
Okay, guys.

33:10.491 --> 33:13.693
As you know, we're looking
for the model with the triple-B.

33:13.693 --> 33:16.396
Business, boss and brand.

33:16.396 --> 33:18.198
It's not just about
a pretty face anymore.

33:18.198 --> 33:20.066
Exactly.
Here we go.

33:27.308 --> 33:28.708
Ladies...

33:28.708 --> 33:35.149
we are looking for 14 models
who can be the undeniable boss.

33:35.149 --> 33:37.317
The winner
of "America's Next Top Model"

33:37.317 --> 33:40.754
will receive $100,000
and be featured

33:40.754 --> 33:44.692
in a commercial
thanks to Rimmel London.

33:44.692 --> 33:47.227
In addition, the winner
will also be featured

33:47.227 --> 33:49.430
in a fashion spread
for "Paper" Magazine

33:49.430 --> 33:54.602
and get an exclusive
one-year talent deal with VH1.

33:54.602 --> 33:58.539
So tomorrow, I'm sending you
to a VIP party,

33:58.539 --> 34:01.241
but not all of you
are gonna get in.

34:01.241 --> 34:03.276
If you're on the list,
I'll see you there.

34:03.276 --> 34:04.911
but if you're not on the list,

34:04.911 --> 34:06.312
that means you're
packing your bags

34:06.312 --> 34:09.482
and you're going home.
Good luck.

34:15.088 --> 34:18.325
♪♪♪

34:18.325 --> 34:21.962
(Cody)
Yesterday, Rita told us, if you
don't make it into the club,

34:21.962 --> 34:24.064
then you're not making it
to the next round

34:24.064 --> 34:26.299
of "America's Next Top Model."
My heart is pounding.

34:29.202 --> 34:31.137
(Arreyon)
I can't wait to see my name
on the list

34:31.137 --> 34:33.540
'cause I doubt my name's
not gonna be there.

34:33.540 --> 34:36.810
I do feel nervous, because
the judges said I didn't have

34:36.810 --> 34:39.713
as much passion
as some of the other girls.

34:39.713 --> 34:41.215
If they don't see me
as competition yet,

34:41.215 --> 34:42.883
they will, for sure.

34:42.883 --> 34:44.084
Come on.

34:45.719 --> 34:47.288
Your name is?

34:47.288 --> 34:48.555
Courtney.

34:52.293 --> 34:54.661
Courtney...
you're good.

35:00.301 --> 35:01.435
Your name?

35:01.435 --> 35:02.870
Giah.

35:02.870 --> 35:04.104
Spell your first name.

35:04.104 --> 35:06.273
G-I-A-H.

35:06.273 --> 35:08.308
Spell your name again?

35:08.308 --> 35:10.944
G-I-A-H.

35:12.313 --> 35:14.214
Go ahead.

35:14.214 --> 35:15.449
Next?

35:15.449 --> 35:16.983
Sorry, Roxy.

35:19.185 --> 35:20.521
Okay, go ahead.

35:20.521 --> 35:21.955
(screams)

35:21.955 --> 35:22.990
Go in.

35:22.990 --> 35:24.024
Woo!

35:24.024 --> 35:25.292
What's your first name?
Arreyon.

35:26.994 --> 35:28.662
Sorry.

35:28.662 --> 35:31.064
No?
It's not there.

35:31.064 --> 35:32.165
Oh, God!

35:32.165 --> 35:33.833
(crying)

35:33.833 --> 35:36.036
It hurts, it
hurts like hell.

35:36.036 --> 35:39.539
Are you sure?
Positive.

35:39.539 --> 35:42.709
But this is not gonna stop
me, this is just only the
beginning.

35:42.709 --> 35:45.179
Oh!
Next.

35:45.179 --> 35:46.479
Your name.
Tash.

35:46.479 --> 35:48.815
(Tash)
So it's definitely
a 50-50 chance

35:48.815 --> 35:50.317
one of us will make it,
one of us might not,

35:50.317 --> 35:52.352
or what if both of us
don't make it.

35:52.352 --> 35:54.654
I wouldn't even know
what to say to that.

35:57.458 --> 35:59.326
Go ahead.

35:59.326 --> 36:03.464
Being part of final 14 has been
completely reassuring to me.

36:03.464 --> 36:06.466
We, Cody and I, are
going to win this competition.

36:06.466 --> 36:07.434
Guaranteed.

36:07.434 --> 36:09.669
Oh, God!
We did it!

36:10.837 --> 36:13.006
Go ahead.
Woo!

36:13.006 --> 36:14.508
Sorry, Brittany.

36:14.508 --> 36:15.943
Thank you.
You're welcome.

36:15.943 --> 36:16.744
Next.

36:16.744 --> 36:17.744
Go in.
Thank you.

36:17.744 --> 36:19.679
Rachel Starr.

36:19.679 --> 36:21.615
My crush with
Kyle is enhancing

36:21.615 --> 36:26.186
and I don't want her and I
to end before it even begins.

36:26.186 --> 36:27.687
Sorry.

36:27.687 --> 36:30.690
You're not there.

36:30.690 --> 36:31.858
Next, please.

36:39.033 --> 36:41.702
It's not (bleep) fair.
It's not (bleep) fair.

36:41.702 --> 36:43.870
It's not (bleep) fair.
(crying)

36:45.505 --> 36:47.207
What's your name?
Binta.

36:47.207 --> 36:48.342
Binta?
Yeah.

36:48.342 --> 36:49.510
Go in.

36:49.510 --> 36:50.511
Yes!

36:50.511 --> 36:51.512
What's your last name?

36:51.512 --> 36:53.947
Roberts.
Go in.

36:53.947 --> 36:55.515
Go in.

36:55.515 --> 36:57.017
Go ahead, Paige.

36:58.552 --> 37:02.823
Quei, Q-U-E-I.
Quei?

37:02.823 --> 37:04.358
No Quei.
Sorry.

37:04.358 --> 37:06.193
Next.

37:06.193 --> 37:08.261
(Quei)
I'm not gonna lie to you,
I'm a little annoyed.

37:08.261 --> 37:11.698
I'm so honest
and raw and open.

37:11.698 --> 37:14.201
And, um, I just feel
like I killed it.

37:14.201 --> 37:18.905
So whoever said no to me,
I would get your head examined.

37:20.574 --> 37:21.942
Next.

37:21.942 --> 37:24.645
Go in.

37:24.645 --> 37:25.979
Nope.
Sorry.

37:25.979 --> 37:26.780
Next up.

37:26.780 --> 37:28.448
My name is Marissa.

37:28.448 --> 37:31.252
M-A-R-I-S-S-A.

37:31.252 --> 37:32.619
Go ahead.

37:36.490 --> 37:38.425
Next.

37:38.425 --> 37:39.493
Your name.

37:39.493 --> 37:41.261
Cody.

37:41.261 --> 37:42.929
(Cody)
I'm just happy
my sister's there,

37:42.929 --> 37:44.665
so if I don't make it in,

37:44.665 --> 37:47.334
at least I can still root
for somebody.

37:47.334 --> 37:48.568
What's your first name?

37:48.568 --> 37:50.236
Cody, C-O-D-Y.

37:52.406 --> 37:53.440
Go ahead.

37:53.440 --> 37:56.109
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

37:56.109 --> 37:58.111
(screaming)

37:59.847 --> 38:02.649
(Giah)
Oh, my God.
The final 14.

38:02.649 --> 38:03.984
It's the best
moment of my life.

38:07.354 --> 38:10.190
I'm not focused
on any of the other girls.

38:10.190 --> 38:11.725
I'm here to make my dreams
come true

38:11.725 --> 38:14.027
and I am becoming
America's Next Top Model.

38:16.229 --> 38:18.432
Starr, get up.

38:18.432 --> 38:20.167
If they can't recognize
how great we are...

38:20.167 --> 38:22.669
I should be in there
with her right now.

38:22.669 --> 38:24.171
Baby, if these people
cannot recognize

38:24.171 --> 38:26.139
how amazing we are,
they're nuts.

38:26.139 --> 38:27.040
They're nuts.

38:33.046 --> 38:35.015
Hi, ladies!

38:35.015 --> 38:39.019
Congratulations on being
the final 14 ladies.

38:39.019 --> 38:42.323
The final 14.
Damn, I'm chosen.

38:42.323 --> 38:45.358
This girl, this girl
chosen right here, that's me.

38:45.358 --> 38:47.027
This means that one of you

38:47.027 --> 38:50.831
are actually gonna become
America's Next Top Model.

38:50.831 --> 38:54.267
You all made great
first impressions on Tyra,

38:54.267 --> 38:55.870
the designers and the new panel.

38:55.870 --> 38:57.638
Now, can you make
a great first impression

38:57.638 --> 38:59.507
on the New York City
fashion scene?

38:59.507 --> 39:00.574
Yes!

39:00.574 --> 39:01.708
All right.
Let's go.

39:03.911 --> 39:06.079
♪♪♪

39:10.384 --> 39:14.287
Hi, New York City!

39:14.287 --> 39:15.922
Thank you for being a part

39:15.922 --> 39:20.828
of our first party
of "America's Next Top Model."

39:20.828 --> 39:24.230
We have 14 brand-new models
to show you.

39:26.333 --> 39:28.568
Make some noise for Courtney.

39:28.568 --> 39:29.937
(cheering and applause...)

39:29.937 --> 39:31.304
Giah!

39:31.304 --> 39:33.907
(Giah)
Oh, my God.
I'm in the final 14.

39:33.907 --> 39:35.608
I have to do this
for the people

39:35.608 --> 39:37.243
who are counting on me
back home.

39:39.413 --> 39:41.148
India.

39:41.148 --> 39:43.416
Krislian, where are you?

39:43.416 --> 39:44.551
Marissa.

39:44.551 --> 39:45.953
There's no going
home for me.

39:45.953 --> 39:47.788
This is everything
I've ever imagined.

39:47.788 --> 39:49.956
I've always wanted
to be the main star

39:49.956 --> 39:51.891
and I definitely had
all eyes on me.

39:54.595 --> 39:56.396
Kyle.

39:56.396 --> 39:58.265
Paige, where you at, girl?

39:58.265 --> 39:59.733
Binta!

39:59.733 --> 40:02.570
(Binta)
Me winning
"America's Next Top Model"

40:02.570 --> 40:06.139
is the most important
thing for me right now.

40:06.139 --> 40:08.208
Cody!

40:08.208 --> 40:09.576
Tash.

40:12.112 --> 40:14.080

I feel like I definitely
have a target on my back.

40:23.390 --> 40:25.926
(Rita)
Please make some noise
for the 14 finalists

40:25.926 --> 40:27.727
of "America's Next Top Model."

40:27.727 --> 40:29.929
(Tatiana)
If someone tries to get
in my way of the completion,

40:29.929 --> 40:31.898
I will gladly step
right over them.

40:31.898 --> 40:35.402
(Cherish)
Bring it on.
Watch out, ladies.
