07:51.179 --> 07:52.722
(all)

07:51.179 --> 07:52.722
Rhonda!

07:52.764 --> 07:54.182
- Rhonda?

07:52.764 --> 07:54.182
- 'That's right.'

07:54.224 --> 07:56.101
(male on radio)

07:54.224 --> 07:56.101
'"Help me, Rhonda."'

07:56.143 --> 07:58.603
[all cheering]

07:58.645 --> 08:01.356
'D.J. Tanner, you're going to be

07:58.645 --> 08:01.356
picked up in a limousine'

08:01.398 --> 08:02.274
'by The Beach Boys themselves.'

08:02.316 --> 08:04.359
- Oh, yes.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.359
- Yeah.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.820
(male on radio)

08:04.401 --> 08:06.820
'You'll travel with them

08:04.401 --> 08:06.820
to their sold out concert.'

08:06.861 --> 08:08.363
Oh, thank you.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.363
Thank you. Thank you.

08:08.405 --> 08:11.032
Alright, a night with

08:08.405 --> 08:11.032
rock 'n roll royalty, folks.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.160
And another chance to

08:11.074 --> 08:13.160
pitch 'em Beach Butter.

08:13.201 --> 08:16.163
Maybe I can get 'em

08:13.201 --> 08:16.163
back on my show.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.039
(male on radio)

08:16.204 --> 08:18.039
'Have you thought about who

08:16.204 --> 08:18.039
you'll be bringing with you to'

08:18.081 --> 08:21.084
'share this once in a lifetime

08:18.081 --> 08:21.084
night with The Beach Boys?'

08:21.126 --> 08:23.086
[clearing throat]

08:23.128 --> 08:25.797
(male on radio)

08:23.128 --> 08:25.797
'I'll bet everyone in

08:23.128 --> 08:25.797
San Francisco would love to go.'

08:25.839 --> 08:29.468
'But remember, you can only

08:25.839 --> 08:29.468
bring one lucky guest.'

08:29.509 --> 08:31.136
Only one?

08:31.178 --> 08:32.846
Me. Me

08:39.727 --> 08:41.646
[instrumental music]

08:42.730 --> 08:44.399
Cheeseburgers for breakfast?

08:44.441 --> 08:47.152
Hey, I can scramble yours

08:44.441 --> 08:47.152
if you like.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.611
I know what he's up to.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.406
He's making D.J.'s

08:48.653 --> 08:51.406
favorite food to butter her up

08:51.448 --> 08:54.742
so she'll take him to

08:51.448 --> 08:54.742
The Beach Boy concert.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.786
Joseph, you're a disgrace.

08:59.206 --> 09:02.042
Uncle Jesse, thanks for making

08:59.206 --> 09:02.042
a tape of my favorite songs.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.465
One disgrace burger.

09:08.507 --> 09:11.885
Hey, I had an extra tape

09:08.507 --> 09:11.885
and five hours to kill.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.805
Cheeseburgers for breakfast?

09:15.847 --> 09:17.724
Nice touch, Joey.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.724
Any fries?

09:19.600 --> 09:20.935
I bet I know

09:19.600 --> 09:20.935
who wants a plate

09:20.977 --> 09:23.563
of my mom's

09:20.977 --> 09:23.563
double fudge brownies.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.023
I do. I do.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.900
Dream on, squirt.

09:26.941 --> 09:30.404
These are for D.J. from her best

09:26.941 --> 09:30.404
friend Kimmy...with love.

09:30.445 --> 09:34.408
If you think she's gonna pick

09:30.445 --> 09:34.408
you over her own sister

09:34.449 --> 09:37.618
then you haven't seen how

09:34.449 --> 09:37.618
I made her bed this morning.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.204
Guys, enough of this.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.540
D.J. is not gonna make

09:39.246 --> 09:41.540
her choice based on bribes

09:41.581 --> 09:42.832
or special treatment.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.792
That's not how I

09:42.874 --> 09:44.792
raised my daughter.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.253
My first born.

09:47.546 --> 09:49.214
Now, tell everybody

09:47.546 --> 09:49.214
who you're picking.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.841
- Yeah, come on. Here we go.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.841
- Okay, here it goes.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.760
I pick..

09:55.762 --> 09:58.306
Boy, I'd hate to see this end.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.683
I wish I could

09:58.348 --> 10:00.683
take all of you.

10:00.725 --> 10:03.520
But since I can't, I pick..

10:07.482 --> 10:09.025
- Uncle Jesse.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.025
- Oh, yeah.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.860
Have mercy.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.860
Thank you, thank you.

10:10.902 --> 10:11.986
- Hey, congratulations.

10:10.902 --> 10:11.986
- Congratulations.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.030
- Alright, thanks.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.030
- Way to go.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.116
Well, what a surprise.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.286
- Have a great time, Jess.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.286
- Thanks.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.620
I'll bring you guys

10:19.327 --> 10:20.620
back T-shirts and stuff.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.581
- 'Yeah.'

10:20.661 --> 10:22.581
- 'Two T-shirts.'

10:23.998 --> 10:26.751
Oh, Michelle.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.751
That's so abstract.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.169
So surreal.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.547
- Pretty.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.547
- 'Pretty?'

10:31.339 --> 10:33.674
Yes, that too.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.718
But, honey,

10:33.716 --> 10:35.718
the secret to great art

10:35.760 --> 10:38.513
is to keep all the paint

10:35.760 --> 10:38.513
on the paper.

10:40.223 --> 10:42.517
Dad, is this a good

10:40.223 --> 10:42.517
outfit for tonight?

10:42.559 --> 10:44.561
Oh, yeah,

10:42.559 --> 10:44.561
that's beautiful, honey.

10:44.603 --> 10:45.895
You're gonna

10:44.603 --> 10:45.895
have a great time.

10:45.937 --> 10:48.440
- I can't wait.

10:45.937 --> 10:48.440
- Uh, D.J., hold on.

10:48.482 --> 10:51.151
Um, just outta curiosity.

10:51.192 --> 10:54.112
How come you picked Uncle Jesse

10:51.192 --> 10:54.112
to go with you tonight?

10:54.154 --> 10:57.407
Because he loves The Beach Boys,

10:54.154 --> 10:57.407
and he's a musician.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.033
Oh. Well..

10:59.075 --> 11:00.535
That makes sense.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.954
I mean, dad, you're

11:00.577 --> 11:02.954
a talk show host.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.831
If I won a night

11:02.996 --> 11:04.831
with Oprah Winfrey

11:04.872 --> 11:07.250
I would definitely pick you.

11:07.292 --> 11:10.044
Well, thanks,

11:07.292 --> 11:10.044
but I like music too.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.712
Just 'cause I'm not

11:10.086 --> 11:11.712
in a band.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.715
I mean...I grew up

11:11.754 --> 11:14.715
with The Beach Boys.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.551
But, hey, it's,

11:14.757 --> 11:16.551
it's no big deal.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.677
Dad, you don't

11:16.593 --> 11:18.677
feel bad, do you?

11:18.719 --> 11:20.347
No, no, it's no problem.

11:20.388 --> 11:23.391
After all, I got to go with

11:20.388 --> 11:23.391
you, and see "Smurfs On Ice."

11:24.934 --> 11:26.311
Go ahead.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.311
Go, get dressed.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.022
Okay, dad.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.941
Pretty.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.819
Oh, no, Michelle.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.446
Honey, on the paper.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.365
On the paper.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.912
Daddy pretty.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.665
Oh, no, Michelle.

11:46.705 --> 11:48.667
Can you say dry cleaner?

11:48.707 --> 11:50.585
Say dry cleaner.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.128
Jess, picture it.

11:52.170 --> 11:55.131
You and D.J., sitting in

11:52.170 --> 11:55.131
a limo with The Beach Boys

11:55.173 --> 11:57.300
you just happen to have

11:55.173 --> 11:57.300
a tape of our awesome

11:57.342 --> 12:01.971
totally tubular, gnarly,

11:57.342 --> 12:01.971
Beach Butter jingle, dude.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.475
A, don't call me dude.

12:05.517 --> 12:08.562
B, it's a dumb idea,

12:05.517 --> 12:08.562
and two, I don't have a tape.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.605
Check your pocket.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.568
How do you do that?

12:14.609 --> 12:16.528
Never mind.

12:14.609 --> 12:16.528
Just think about it.

12:16.570 --> 12:19.322
Okay.

12:16.570 --> 12:19.322
Get out.

12:19.364 --> 12:22.701
You need to mellow down, dude.

12:19.364 --> 12:22.701
I'm serious, man.

12:24.785 --> 12:27.455
I said, can you..

12:24.785 --> 12:27.455
Hi, how are you? Come in.

12:27.497 --> 12:30.083
Jesse, look at this.

12:27.497 --> 12:30.083
An original Michelle Tanner.

12:30.124 --> 12:33.127
One day, this will be hanging in

12:30.124 --> 12:33.127
the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.296
On their refrigerator.

12:35.338 --> 12:38.174
Oh, great,

12:35.338 --> 12:38.174
you're both here.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.759
I forgot I promised Kimmy

12:38.216 --> 12:40.759
we'd go ice skating.

12:40.801 --> 12:43.137
So, dad, I want you

12:40.801 --> 12:43.137
to go with Uncle Jesse

12:43.179 --> 12:44.723
to The Beach Boys tonight.

12:44.763 --> 12:45.932
Have a great time.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.727
D.J.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.770
What was that all about?

12:51.812 --> 12:53.648
Oh, maybe she thinks

12:51.812 --> 12:53.648
she hurt my feelings

12:53.690 --> 12:57.026
when she picked you to go

12:53.690 --> 12:57.026
instead of her own father.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.446
Did she hurt your feelings?

12:59.487 --> 13:01.656
Well, maybe a little.

13:02.907 --> 13:06.035
I just thought she'd

13:02.907 --> 13:06.035
wanna go with her dad.

13:06.077 --> 13:10.039
But I guess I can't compete

13:06.077 --> 13:10.039
with Uncle Rock 'n Roll.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.874
What're you saying here?

13:10.081 --> 13:11.874
You're saying that, that

13:11.916 --> 13:13.834
you're jealous of me?

13:13.876 --> 13:17.171
If anybody should be jealous,

13:13.876 --> 13:17.171
it should be me jealous of you.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.006
That makes no sense.

13:19.048 --> 13:22.302
You have something going with

13:19.048 --> 13:22.302
these girls I'll never have.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.179
I mean, like Stephanie.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.889
When she made her first

13:25.221 --> 13:26.889
ceramic handprint

13:26.931 --> 13:29.976
who did she give it to?

13:26.931 --> 13:29.976
Dad.

13:30.017 --> 13:33.313
And, and what was Michelle's

13:30.017 --> 13:33.313
very first word?

13:33.354 --> 13:35.774
- Cookie.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.774
- After cookie.

13:35.814 --> 13:39.653
She looked up to you,

13:35.814 --> 13:39.653
and said, "Dadda."

13:39.694 --> 13:41.780
And D.J., when

13:39.694 --> 13:41.780
she gets married

13:41.820 --> 13:43.657
who's gonna march her

13:41.820 --> 13:43.657
down the aisle?

13:46.117 --> 13:47.661
- Dad.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.661
- That's right, dad.

13:47.702 --> 13:51.205
See? There's three good

13:47.702 --> 13:51.205
reasons why I envy you.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.249
I just hope one day,

13:51.247 --> 13:53.249
I'm lucky enough

13:53.291 --> 13:56.503
to have kids that love me as

13:53.291 --> 13:56.503
much as those girls love you.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.045
They do worship me,

13:56.544 --> 13:58.045
don't they?

14:00.548 --> 14:01.840
[sighs]

14:01.882 --> 14:05.512
Jesse...thanks for

14:01.882 --> 14:05.512
reminding me how lucky I am.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.182
You're gonna...

14:06.680 --> 14:09.182
hug me, aren't you?

14:09.223 --> 14:11.058
- You leave me no choice.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.058
- Oh, gee.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.109
D.J., look.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.362
I'm sorry I put you

14:20.151 --> 14:22.362
in a tough spot.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.489
Picking Uncle Jesse was fine.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.575
You two should just go,

14:24.531 --> 14:27.575
and have a great time.

14:27.617 --> 14:30.161
But The Beach Boys

14:27.617 --> 14:30.161
mean a lot to you.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.871
I want you to go.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.708
D.J., I've changed

14:31.912 --> 14:34.708
my mind about The Beach Boys.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.459
I want you to go

14:34.749 --> 14:36.459
with your father.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.961
- I'm not going.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.961
- Well, I'm not going.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.715
This concert was

14:39.003 --> 14:41.715
supposed to be fun.

14:41.756 --> 14:45.134
Now, everybody's either

14:41.756 --> 14:45.134
hurt or disappointed.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.554
It's just not worth it.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.348
- I'm not going.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.348
- I'll go.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.058
You'll go where?

14:52.099 --> 14:55.936
To see The Beach Boys.

14:52.099 --> 14:55.936
Wanna be my date?

14:55.978 --> 14:58.606
What're you wearing?

14:55.978 --> 14:58.606
We should coordinate.

14:58.648 --> 15:01.317
Hold it.

14:58.648 --> 15:01.317
