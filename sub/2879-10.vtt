WEBVTT

00:02.443 --> 00:06.496
Is anyone else troubled by
the Spider-Man theme song?

00:06.498 --> 00:08.665
Why would it trouble you?

00:08.667 --> 00:10.984
It's, like, your third favorite
cartoon theme song.

00:10.986 --> 00:12.636
It is, right behind

00:12.638 --> 00:15.672
♪ Do do-do do-do,
Inspector Gadget... ♪

00:16.624 --> 00:19.793
...and ♪ Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles ♪

00:19.795 --> 00:21.211
♪ Heroes in a half-shell

00:21.213 --> 00:23.730
♪ Turtle power!

00:23.732 --> 00:26.566
However, the Spider-Man lyrics
posit that

00:26.568 --> 00:29.886
"Spider-Man, Spider-Man
does whatever a spider can."

00:29.888 --> 00:31.271
Yeah, so?

00:31.273 --> 00:33.390
I can think of many things
Spider-Man can't do

00:33.392 --> 00:35.092
that a spider can.

00:35.094 --> 00:37.561
One: crawl in your ear and die.

00:38.613 --> 00:41.515
Two: legally leave Guatemala
without a passport.

00:42.483 --> 00:44.868
Three: have sex with a spider.

00:46.154 --> 00:47.371
Can we change the subject?

00:47.373 --> 00:50.240
Spiders give me
the jeebie-jeebies.

00:50.242 --> 00:53.043
It's "heebie-jeebies."

00:53.045 --> 00:56.246
I know, but that sounds
anti-Semitic.

00:57.364 --> 00:58.582
Anyway, I was thinking

00:58.584 --> 01:00.667
we could have a little
film festival tonight.

01:00.669 --> 01:03.670
The theme: movies that killed
their franchises.

01:03.672 --> 01:04.938
Oh.

01:04.940 --> 01:08.475
Like <i>Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4,</i>
<i>Daredevil 1.</i>

01:09.595 --> 01:14.147
<i>Miss Congeniality 2:</i>
<i>Armed and Fabulous.</i>

01:14.149 --> 01:16.483
I mean, you know a movie's bad

01:16.485 --> 01:19.186
when my homegirl Sandy B.
can't save it.

01:19.188 --> 01:22.272
Penny's working tonight;
I'm in.

01:22.274 --> 01:24.091
Not me.
I'm having dinner

01:24.093 --> 01:25.892
with Bernadette and her parents.

01:25.894 --> 01:27.944
Fun. We know how much
you love that.

01:27.946 --> 01:28.912
It's torture.

01:28.914 --> 01:30.414
Especially with her dad.

01:30.416 --> 01:31.915
We have nothing in common.

01:31.917 --> 01:34.734
You know what I like to do
when I'm forced to speak

01:34.736 --> 01:37.704
with those beneath my
intellectual station?

01:37.706 --> 01:39.873
I bring up an
interesting topic,

01:39.875 --> 01:44.177
like the difference between
Spider-Man and spiders.

01:45.579 --> 01:46.630
Thanks, Sheldon.

01:46.632 --> 01:48.265
I'll try that
with my father-in-law.

01:48.267 --> 01:49.516
No, you can't
use that one.

01:49.518 --> 01:50.517
That's mine.

01:50.519 --> 01:52.219
Uh, try this one
for an ice-breaker.

01:52.221 --> 01:55.222
Uh, despite popular
lore, there is no place

01:55.224 --> 01:57.924
in the continental United
States, Alaska or Hawaii

01:57.926 --> 02:00.927
from which one can dig straight
through the center of the earth

02:00.929 --> 02:02.428
and come up in China.

02:04.232 --> 02:05.949
Great, thank you.

02:05.951 --> 02:07.701
Actually, you can't
have that one either.

02:07.703 --> 02:09.035
It's too good. Sorry.

02:09.620 --> 02:10.604
What about you, Sheldon?

02:10.606 --> 02:11.788
Do you have any plans tonight?

02:11.790 --> 02:13.457
Sadly, yes.

02:13.459 --> 02:15.842
Amy's taking me
to a memorial service.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.561
It's for one of
her colleagues

02:17.563 --> 02:20.964
who is of Asian descent, so
my planned conversational gambit

02:20.966 --> 02:23.467
is to casually remark
that no matter how deep

02:23.469 --> 02:27.504
they dig his grave, he'll never
make his way back to China.

02:29.290 --> 02:31.791
That should lighten the mood.

02:31.793 --> 02:32.859
What can I say?

02:32.861 --> 02:34.895
I put the "fun" in funeral.

Amy. Amy.

03:07.726 --> 03:10.276
Oh, right, funeral.

03:10.278 --> 03:12.112
Amy.

03:13.998 --> 03:15.782
Hello, Sheldon.

03:15.784 --> 03:18.234
I'm not allowed to wear
my Silver Surfer neck tie,

03:18.236 --> 03:20.920
but you can wear a bathrobe?

03:20.922 --> 03:23.256
I think I'm too sick
to go to the funeral.

03:23.258 --> 03:24.741
You're sick?

03:24.743 --> 03:26.209
You poor kid.

03:26.211 --> 03:27.427
Well, see ya.

03:28.929 --> 03:31.381
Sheldon, aren't you
gonna take care of me?

03:31.383 --> 03:32.465
Me?

03:32.467 --> 03:35.301
No. No, I'm not
that kind of doctor.

03:35.303 --> 03:38.271
But our relationship agreement
clearly states

03:38.273 --> 03:41.424
that when one of us is sick, the
other must take care of them.

03:41.426 --> 03:43.777
Oh, I see the
confusion.

03:43.779 --> 03:46.563
No, the intent
behind that clause

03:46.565 --> 03:50.950
was to force <i>you</i> to take
care of <i>me</i> when I'm ill.

03:50.952 --> 03:53.703
When you're feeling better,
you'll think that's funny.

03:57.575 --> 03:59.492
Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.

Amy. Amy. Amy.

04:15.459 --> 04:16.810
I made a commitment in writing

04:16.812 --> 04:18.894
to comfort you
in times like this.

04:18.897 --> 04:20.814
Additionally, you are
my girlfriend,

04:20.815 --> 04:22.899
and I care about
your well-being.

04:24.735 --> 04:26.352
Thank you, Sheldon.

04:26.354 --> 04:27.520
You're welcome.

04:27.522 --> 04:29.155
Now let's get this over with.

04:42.086 --> 04:44.120
So, how have
you been?

04:44.122 --> 04:45.939
Fine.

04:45.941 --> 04:48.124
Good.

04:48.126 --> 04:50.343
Fine is good.

04:58.969 --> 05:00.470
How you liking retirement?

05:00.472 --> 05:02.839
It's fine.

05:04.675 --> 05:06.008
I'm sensing a theme.

05:11.415 --> 05:16.453
You ever really think about
the Spider-Man theme song?

05:18.088 --> 05:20.423
How's that dinner coming?

05:20.425 --> 05:22.375
I just put it in.
It's gonna be a while.

05:22.377 --> 05:23.860
I like rare chicken.

05:23.862 --> 05:25.879
Let's do this.

05:25.881 --> 05:27.864
You could die.

05:31.836 --> 05:33.837
Death by chicken.

05:33.839 --> 05:37.390
That's a pretty "fowl" way
to go.

05:42.263 --> 05:44.230
Here's another
beer, honey.

05:44.232 --> 05:46.048
Thank you.

05:46.050 --> 05:49.719
So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took
that trip to the Grand Canyon.

05:49.721 --> 05:50.887
How was it?

05:50.889 --> 05:54.557
It was good.

05:57.912 --> 06:00.747
Had no idea
you were the chatty one.

06:08.789 --> 06:10.590
102.2.

06:11.676 --> 06:15.178
Exactly what it was
half an hour ago.

06:15.180 --> 06:18.181
It's like you're not even
trying to get better.

06:20.050 --> 06:23.102
Sheldon, you don't get over
the flu in half an hour.

06:23.104 --> 06:25.021
Well, not with that attitude.

06:26.524 --> 06:30.443
I have to say, I'm finding your
bedside manner a little lacking.

06:30.445 --> 06:31.644
I'm sorry.

06:31.646 --> 06:33.746
I just want you to get better
as soon as possible.

06:33.748 --> 06:36.916
And with that goal in mind,
let me ask you a question.

06:36.918 --> 06:40.770
Do you believe in
the placebo effect?

06:40.772 --> 06:41.905
Of course I do.

06:41.907 --> 06:44.123
There have been many studies
proving its validity.

06:44.125 --> 06:45.325
Great.

06:45.327 --> 06:48.595
Now, this may look
like a Tic Tac...

06:50.281 --> 06:55.051
...but it is really a powerful
medication specifically designed

06:55.053 --> 06:58.721
to cure your illness as well as
freshen your breath.

06:58.723 --> 07:01.891
Sheldon, this isn't helping.

07:01.893 --> 07:03.943
Why don't you just let me
get some rest.

07:03.945 --> 07:05.011
How can you sleep?

07:05.013 --> 07:07.063
I'm not done
making you feel better.

07:07.065 --> 07:10.600
I still have to put a
cold rag on your head,

07:10.602 --> 07:14.354
sing to you and apply VapoRub
to your chest.

07:21.712 --> 07:25.214
Y-You want to rub something
on my chest?

07:25.216 --> 07:27.817
Yes.

07:27.819 --> 07:29.836
All over it.

07:33.592 --> 07:35.425
Maybe we should start with that.

07:37.211 --> 07:39.596
Now you're being a
responsible patient.

07:49.640 --> 07:54.777
Now, you may notice
some tingling.

07:54.779 --> 07:57.697
Oh, I'm counting on it.

07:59.516 --> 08:02.685
Oh.

08:03.837 --> 08:06.022
Okay, dig in.

08:06.024 --> 08:09.191
Hold up.

08:09.193 --> 08:11.694
Bless us, O Lord
for these Thy gifts

08:11.696 --> 08:13.329
which we are about to receive

08:13.331 --> 08:14.497
from Thy bounty

08:14.499 --> 08:16.532
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

08:18.502 --> 08:21.754
Took the words
right out of my mouth.

08:23.841 --> 08:26.809
So, Dad, have you done
any fishing lately?

08:26.811 --> 08:28.261
I'm going next weekend.

08:28.263 --> 08:30.063
Oh, you like to fish?

08:30.065 --> 08:33.549
Yes.

08:35.352 --> 08:38.938
Sure. I can hear it
in your voice.

08:38.940 --> 08:43.659
Oh, if he didn't like it,
he wouldn't go.

08:43.662 --> 08:47.363
You know, I hadn't
thought of that.

08:47.365 --> 08:50.033
Help me.

08:50.035 --> 08:52.535
Hey, Dad, maybe you could take
Howard fishing sometime.

08:52.537 --> 08:54.754
Give you guys a chance to get
to know each other better.

08:54.756 --> 08:57.073
No, no.

08:57.075 --> 08:58.574
We know each other
well enough.

08:58.576 --> 09:01.594
He's been talking
my ear off all night.

09:01.596 --> 09:03.179
Howie, I think you'd have fun.

09:06.450 --> 09:09.469
Fine, you can tag along.

09:09.471 --> 09:10.853
Terrific.

09:10.855 --> 09:13.022
My two favorite fellas
gone fishin'.

09:13.024 --> 09:15.224
Well, hang on a
second, Bernie.

09:15.226 --> 09:17.827
Next weekend, we
have that thing.

09:17.829 --> 09:18.978
Whathing?

09:18.980 --> 09:21.948
You know, the thing.

09:21.950 --> 09:23.816
Oh, that thing.

09:23.818 --> 09:25.601
No, I cancelled that thing.

09:27.037 --> 09:28.621
All right, it's settled.

09:28.623 --> 09:30.406
You and I are going fishing.

09:30.408 --> 09:31.941
Great.

09:31.943 --> 09:34.327
Thanks for the help.

09:35.496 --> 09:37.163
I've never even
been fishing.

09:37.165 --> 09:38.881
This is gonna
be a disaster.

09:38.883 --> 09:41.084
If you don't want to look
foolish doing something,

09:41.086 --> 09:42.785
you should practice.

09:42.787 --> 09:45.805
Do you know how many beef
Wellingtons I made by myself

09:45.807 --> 09:47.840
before I invited you guys over?

09:49.009 --> 09:50.176
I'll give you a hint.

09:50.178 --> 09:55.131
You can see them
here, here... and here.

09:57.518 --> 09:59.018
Raj is probably right.

09:59.020 --> 10:01.137
You should get someone
to give you some pointers.

10:01.139 --> 10:02.955
Do either of you guys
know how to fish?

10:02.957 --> 10:05.858
No.

10:05.860 --> 10:07.476
But if you
catch anything,

10:07.478 --> 10:10.646
I know how to steam
it in banana leaves.

10:10.648 --> 10:12.665
Come on, we must know somebody

10:12.667 --> 10:15.501
who can do manly stuff
like this.

10:18.422 --> 10:20.590
S'up?

10:29.076 --> 10:31.794
Step one: worms.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.248
Ew!

10:36.216 --> 10:38.301
Okay, right there,
"ew" is one of the things

10:38.303 --> 10:40.920
you're not gonna want to say
in front of your father-in-law.

10:40.922 --> 10:43.806
It's right up there with "icky"
and "get it away."

10:43.808 --> 10:45.758
Now pick one up.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.226
Really?

10:47.228 --> 10:49.012
You're gonna have to do it
when you're fishing.

10:49.014 --> 10:51.180
Okay.

10:54.685 --> 10:56.069
What are you waiting for?

10:56.071 --> 10:59.972
I don't know, for them
to die of natural causes.

10:59.974 --> 11:03.109
Just pick up a worm
and put him on this hook.

11:04.578 --> 11:06.946
Fine.

11:17.441 --> 11:19.125
There.

11:19.127 --> 11:20.710
I'm no expert,

11:20.712 --> 11:23.546
but I think the hook has
to go through the worm.

11:23.548 --> 11:25.665
Fine.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.717
Sorry, Mr. Worm.

11:27.719 --> 11:30.136
Sherm.
Sherm the Worm.

11:31.021 --> 11:32.171
Hey, don't name him.

11:32.173 --> 11:34.057
Just jab a hook in his face.

11:36.009 --> 11:37.977
You got this, buddy.
Yeah, come on, Howard.

11:37.979 --> 11:39.646
Hook that worm.
You can do it.

11:39.648 --> 11:40.980
That's great.

11:40.982 --> 11:43.032
Cheerleading--
way to man things up.

11:46.403 --> 11:48.488
"And the control group displayed

11:48.490 --> 11:52.358
"significantly fewer
genetic abnormalities.

11:52.360 --> 11:56.362
"But, because of flaws
in the experimental design

11:56.364 --> 11:58.748
"relating to
environment and diet,

11:58.750 --> 12:01.351
they lived
inconclusively ever after."

12:01.353 --> 12:03.336
The end.

12:03.338 --> 12:04.821
That was great.

12:04.823 --> 12:06.239
Rub my chest again.

12:07.459 --> 12:08.841
No.

12:08.843 --> 12:10.693
I need to get you down
for a nap.

12:10.695 --> 12:14.230
For some reason, that VapoRub
gets you all fired up.

12:16.483 --> 12:17.984
How's the poor thing?

12:17.986 --> 12:20.903
Oh, I'm hanging in there.
Thanks for asking.

12:21.739 --> 12:23.406
Okay, Amy,
I brought you some drugs

12:23.408 --> 12:25.174
we were working
on in the lab.

12:25.176 --> 12:27.393
This is proving really
good for congestion,

12:27.395 --> 12:28.578
but there's a slight chance

12:28.580 --> 12:30.530
it can make your tears
burn like acid,

12:30.532 --> 12:32.515
so if you take it--
happy thoughts.

12:34.168 --> 12:36.786
Uh, I'm going to draw
you a soothing bath.

12:36.788 --> 12:38.538
Where's your bath thermometer?

12:38.540 --> 12:40.456
I don't have a bath thermometer.

12:40.458 --> 12:42.341
Fine. Then I'm going to draw you

12:42.343 --> 12:44.961
a nerve-wracking bath
of indeterminate temperature.

12:47.031 --> 12:49.132
This is a really
good expectorant.

12:49.134 --> 12:51.134
Although some
test subjects reported

12:51.136 --> 12:54.137
lactating uncontrollably
when they heard music.

12:55.088 --> 12:56.723
Okay, okay, here's the deal.

12:56.725 --> 12:58.758
I don't need your medicine.
I'm not sick.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.092
I don't understand.

13:00.094 --> 13:01.761
I got better two days ago.

13:01.763 --> 13:05.314
It's just been so nice
having Sheldon take care of me.

13:05.316 --> 13:06.866
So you've just
been lying to him?

13:06.868 --> 13:08.484
See the stuff in my nose?

13:08.486 --> 13:10.603
Rubber cement.

13:11.538 --> 13:13.740
I don't mean to be judgy,

13:13.742 --> 13:17.410
but this is the kind
of thing lunatics do.

13:18.278 --> 13:19.746
All right.

13:19.748 --> 13:21.781
I'll tell him.

13:21.783 --> 13:23.466
Amy, would you
be strong enough

13:23.468 --> 13:26.319
to bathe yourself,
or do you need my help?

13:29.239 --> 13:31.557
I'll tell him tomorrow.

13:33.510 --> 13:35.645
Mama needs a bath.

13:38.232 --> 13:39.982
Now, let's assume,
by some miracle,

13:39.984 --> 13:41.184
you actually catch a fish.

13:41.186 --> 13:43.236
You're going to have to know
how to gut it.

13:43.238 --> 13:44.904
So, what you're
going to do

13:44.906 --> 13:47.023
is you're going to take
your knife,

13:47.025 --> 13:49.325
slice him right up the belly.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.580
You want me to stop?

13:54.582 --> 13:55.748
No, I'm fine.
Keep going.

13:55.750 --> 13:57.250
All right. Now, you
don't want to cut

13:57.252 --> 13:58.451
too deep into its guts,

13:58.453 --> 14:00.453
or the blood will just squirt
all over your face.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.458
Oh, my God.

14:05.460 --> 14:07.326
What is with you guys?

14:07.328 --> 14:08.628
It's not our fault.

14:08.630 --> 14:11.047
Our dads never did anything
like this with us.

14:11.049 --> 14:12.164
What, never?

14:12.166 --> 14:14.100
My dad was an
anthropologist.

14:14.102 --> 14:16.185
The only father-son
time he spent

14:16.187 --> 14:19.939
was with a 2,000-year-old
skeleton of an Etruscan boy.

14:19.941 --> 14:22.308
I hated that kid.

14:23.811 --> 14:26.279
Mine just took me
to his gynecology office.

14:26.281 --> 14:28.981
I got so bored,
I'd put vaginal lubricant

14:28.983 --> 14:33.402
on the bottom of my shoes
and pretend I was ice-skating.

14:36.957 --> 14:38.791
Yeah, well, my quality
father-son time

14:38.793 --> 14:41.460
was spending my adolescence
looking out the window

14:41.462 --> 14:44.881
waiting for my dad
to come back someday.

14:46.032 --> 14:48.417
Yeah, okay, Howard wins.

14:49.553 --> 14:51.971
You know, maybe we didn't
have opportunities like this

14:51.973 --> 14:53.723
when we were growing up,
but right now,

14:53.725 --> 14:56.225
there's a dad that wants
to take you on a fishing trip.

14:56.227 --> 14:57.810
You're right.

14:57.812 --> 14:59.145
I should do this.

14:59.147 --> 15:00.229
Great.

15:00.231 --> 15:01.230
Here you go.

15:01.232 --> 15:02.431
What you're
going to do

15:02.433 --> 15:03.766
is you're going to
stick your thumb

15:03.768 --> 15:06.569
down its throat, grab
the guts and pull.

15:10.107 --> 15:12.158
Here we go.

15:17.664 --> 15:19.916
Oh, look, it's a female.
You can see all the eggs.

15:24.821 --> 15:27.156
♪ I'm walking on sunshine ♪

15:27.158 --> 15:28.908
♪ Whoa, oh

15:28.910 --> 15:30.843
♪ And don't it feel good? ♪

15:30.845 --> 15:33.179
♪ Oh, yeah

15:33.181 --> 15:35.331
♪ And don't it feel good? ♪

15:39.102 --> 15:42.305
Oh, Sheldon,
am I glad you're back.

15:42.307 --> 15:44.690
Taking a turn for the worst.

15:45.943 --> 15:49.061
I think I'm going to need
another bath.

15:49.063 --> 15:51.447
I'm surprised to hear that.

15:51.449 --> 15:53.866
See, the other day,
I was concerned

15:53.868 --> 15:55.401
that you weren't recovering,

15:55.403 --> 15:56.669
so while you
were sleeping,

15:56.671 --> 15:59.989
I took a cheek swab
and had it cultured in the lab.

15:59.991 --> 16:01.574
Oh?

16:01.576 --> 16:03.242
I got the results back.

16:03.244 --> 16:06.379
Have you developed any of
the following symptoms?

16:06.381 --> 16:08.381
A growing nose,

16:08.383 --> 16:12.919
or perhaps a warm sensation
in the trouser region?

16:12.921 --> 16:14.286
Also known as

16:14.288 --> 16:17.390
full-blown
"liar, liar, pants on fire."

16:17.392 --> 16:19.242
All right, all right.

16:19.244 --> 16:21.293
But I really was sick
at the beginning.

16:21.295 --> 16:24.981
It's just been so nice
having you take care of me.

16:26.099 --> 16:28.851
It hurts that you
would lie to me, Amy.

16:28.853 --> 16:31.988
I thought our relationship
was based on trust

16:31.990 --> 16:36.025
and a mutual admiration
that skews in my favor.

16:36.027 --> 16:38.411
I feel terrible I did this.

16:38.413 --> 16:39.862
It pains me to say it,

16:39.864 --> 16:42.748
but I think some form
of penalty is in order,

16:42.750 --> 16:46.452
so as to discourage this type
of behavior in the future.

16:46.454 --> 16:49.372
I suppose that's fair.
What do you suggest?

16:49.374 --> 16:50.873
In a perfect world,
I'd lock you

16:50.875 --> 16:52.792
in a stockade in
the public square.

16:54.127 --> 16:56.679
That probably
requires a permit.

16:59.132 --> 17:00.516
I could not be allowed

17:00.518 --> 17:03.185
to go to the opening
of the next <i>Star Trek</i> movie.

17:03.187 --> 17:06.137
Oh, that seems
overly harsh.

17:07.207 --> 17:09.008
You gave in to a
hun weakness.

17:09.010 --> 17:10.393
You didn't kill a man.

17:10.395 --> 17:14.613
You know, it's a
tad old-school,

17:14.615 --> 17:17.366
but my father was not
one to spare the rod

17:17.367 --> 17:19.535
when my brother would
sneak into his truck

17:19.537 --> 17:21.904
and drink his
driving whiskey.

17:24.174 --> 17:27.576
Are you saying
you want to spank me?

17:30.213 --> 17:32.748
I don't want to.

17:33.734 --> 17:37.086
But it looks like you
left me no choice.

17:38.672 --> 17:40.890
That's true.

17:43.176 --> 17:46.946
I've been a very bad girl.

17:50.767 --> 17:53.486
Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's
off to fish we go.

17:55.022 --> 17:56.989
That's what you're wearing?

17:56.991 --> 17:58.024
No good?

17:58.026 --> 17:59.892
The guy at
the sporting goods store

17:59.894 --> 18:01.777
said these are what
fishermen wear.

18:01.779 --> 18:04.513
Maybe in cartoons.

18:05.365 --> 18:07.450
Wish I had known that
before I posted

18:07.452 --> 18:09.919
all those pictures on Facebook.

18:11.371 --> 18:13.539
All right,
let's hit the road.

18:13.541 --> 18:16.075
I wouldn't mind shooting
some ducks in the morning.

18:16.077 --> 18:18.177
Wait, now we're shooting things?

18:19.129 --> 18:21.464
I like using a big shell.

18:21.466 --> 18:23.049
You can't eat them afterwards,

18:23.051 --> 18:25.417
but it's fun
watching them blow up.

18:29.439 --> 18:30.773
Sir, I'm flattered

18:30.775 --> 18:32.892
that you invited me,

18:32.894 --> 18:36.228
and I really want you
to like me,

18:36.230 --> 18:37.446
but...

18:37.448 --> 18:41.734
I don't think this trip
is the way to do it.

18:41.736 --> 18:43.602
And I can't return
these things

18:43.604 --> 18:46.438
if there's chunks
of duck all over them.

18:46.440 --> 18:48.424
So, why'd you
agree to come?

18:48.426 --> 18:50.943
'Cause Bernadette made me.

18:50.945 --> 18:52.695
I tried to back out, too.

18:52.697 --> 18:55.280
My wife said I had to go.

18:55.282 --> 18:57.800
Really?
Your wife makes you do stuff?

18:57.802 --> 18:59.835
You're a big, scary cop.

18:59.837 --> 19:01.170
You're an astronaut,

19:01.172 --> 19:03.472
and your wife
makes you do things,

19:03.474 --> 19:06.225
and she's only four feet tall.

19:09.129 --> 19:11.147
So, what do we do now?

19:11.149 --> 19:14.150
They expect us to go
away for the weekend.

19:14.152 --> 19:16.185
Ah...

19:19.990 --> 19:23.859
There's an Indian casino
near Palm Springs.

19:25.061 --> 19:27.196
You know how to shoot craps?

19:27.198 --> 19:29.498
No, but I'm not a
stranger to dice games.

19:29.500 --> 19:33.369
I was the Temple Beth-El
Hebrew School Yahtzee champion.

19:35.205 --> 19:37.223
Mazel tov.

19:38.491 --> 19:40.926
I'll teach you how to play.

19:40.928 --> 19:43.262
Really?

19:43.264 --> 19:46.198
Thank you, sir.

19:47.517 --> 19:49.552
Call me Mike.

19:51.171 --> 19:53.339
Okay.

19:55.842 --> 19:57.359
Oh, boy,
we're just married

19:57.361 --> 20:00.529
to a couple of
ballbusters, huh, Mike?

20:01.865 --> 20:04.900
That's my wife and daughter
you're talking about.

20:06.203 --> 20:09.455
Great couple of gals.

20:09.457 --> 20:11.740
I wouldn't go that far.

20:22.266 --> 20:25.101
Are you prepared to
receive your punishment?

20:28.272 --> 20:30.189
One second.

20:30.191 --> 20:32.224
I want to put on some music.

20:33.043 --> 20:35.161
Why?

20:35.163 --> 20:37.330
I don't want to disturb
the people next door

20:37.332 --> 20:38.998
while you discipline me.

20:45.172 --> 20:46.789
Very well, then.

20:46.791 --> 20:49.375
Get over my knee.
Let's begin.

20:56.033 --> 20:58.217
Oh, my.

20:58.219 --> 20:59.736
Excuse me.

20:59.738 --> 21:02.305
You're not supposed to be
enjoying this.

21:02.307 --> 21:05.525
Then maybe you should
spank me harder.

21:08.796 --> 21:12.328
Maybe I will.
Ooh!
