00:01.469 --> 00:02.471
(dramatic music)

00:02.572 --> 00:04.008
- [Narrator] The toy
industry rakes in

00:04.174 --> 00:06.780
over $90 billion every year,

00:09.318 --> 00:12.993
and it's dominated by
two American empires:

00:13.192 --> 00:15.665
Hasbro and Mattel.

00:17.067 --> 00:19.338
- [Kirk] The rivalry
between Hasbro and Mattel

00:19.471 --> 00:21.275
has always been neck and neck.

00:22.377 --> 00:23.948
- [Narrator] But in
the mid 20th century,

00:24.081 --> 00:26.486
they're not even in
the toy business.

00:26.587 --> 00:30.093
- Mattel started out
by making furniture.

00:31.395 --> 00:34.268
- Hassenfeld brothers made
pencils, pencil boxes.

00:34.335 --> 00:37.107
- [Narrator] Until they
dare to shift directions.

00:38.209 --> 00:39.747
- Ruth Handler
didn't like to lose.

00:39.779 --> 00:44.857
- Every outfit custom made by
world-class fashion designers.

00:45.625 --> 00:50.100
- [Man] Machine guns,
bazookas, flame throwers.

00:50.267 --> 00:53.006
- His name is G.I. Joe.

00:53.106 --> 00:55.110
- [Narrator] They
break all the rules.

00:55.210 --> 00:56.547
- No mother is going
to buy her daughter

00:56.547 --> 00:57.649
a doll with breasts.

00:57.749 --> 01:00.721
- It's not a doll,
it's an action figure.

01:01.690 --> 01:03.259
- You're out of your mind.

01:04.529 --> 01:07.201
- [Azhelle] The Barbie
doll's body was probably

01:07.234 --> 01:10.106
the first thing that moms
saw and said, "Oh no.

01:10.273 --> 01:12.779
She looks like a hooker."

01:14.381 --> 01:16.419
- [Narrator] And
some break the law.

01:16.520 --> 01:19.058
- They might as well
have cut her heart out.

01:19.124 --> 01:21.697
- [Narrator] To become
giants of a revolution.

01:21.763 --> 01:24.101
- We're talking about the
biggest battle in Toyland:

01:24.268 --> 01:26.305
Hasbro versus Mattel.

01:32.117 --> 01:34.723
(dramatic music)

01:47.782 --> 01:49.285
(upbeat music)

01:49.418 --> 01:50.889
- [Narrator] The
end of World War II

01:50.889 --> 01:53.159
brings a time of optimism.

01:53.259 --> 01:55.598
With the hardships of
wartime in the past,

01:56.733 --> 01:59.105
the US experiences a
period of prosperity

01:59.171 --> 02:02.712
that sees the growth of
industry, consumerism,

02:03.847 --> 02:05.518
and the family.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.756
- [Debora] After the war,
the economy was booming.

02:07.855 --> 02:09.926
The marriages that
had been put on hold,

02:09.926 --> 02:11.462
all of a sudden took place.

02:11.596 --> 02:13.266
Everybody started having babies,

02:13.366 --> 02:15.037
and people wanted to
give their children

02:15.203 --> 02:16.774
what they couldn't have.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.378
- That generation that grew
up through the Depression

02:19.445 --> 02:22.752
went through World War II and
had more disposable income.

02:22.819 --> 02:25.323
And so the toy industry has
started to really blossom

02:25.490 --> 02:27.562
and grow because of that.

02:27.562 --> 02:30.400
(dramatic music)

02:31.469 --> 02:32.839
- [Narrator] And in Los Angeles,

02:32.872 --> 02:35.511
a young couple starts a
business out of their garage,

02:35.644 --> 02:37.982
hoping to capitalize
on the boom.

02:38.182 --> 02:40.788
(heels clacking)

02:47.367 --> 02:49.572
- [Ruth] What are
you staring at?

02:49.739 --> 02:50.942
- [Narrator] The woman in charge

02:50.942 --> 02:53.547
is 28 year old Ruth Handler.

02:55.350 --> 02:56.586
- Ruth Handler was the 10th

02:56.753 --> 02:59.993
and last child of her parents

02:59.993 --> 03:01.697
who were Polish
Jewish immigrants.

03:01.797 --> 03:03.568
- Her father was a
gambler her whole life.

03:03.667 --> 03:06.339
The family had exhausted
their resources

03:06.506 --> 03:07.775
by the time she came around.

03:07.775 --> 03:09.412
- Be careful with that.

03:09.478 --> 03:12.484
- [Narrator] Ruth's mother
gives her a way as a baby

03:12.652 --> 03:14.989
to her eldest sister.

03:15.256 --> 03:18.363
- Whereas most people would
be kind of stunted by that

03:18.530 --> 03:20.568
incredibly difficult childhood,

03:20.668 --> 03:23.708
Ruth was your
archetypal striver.

03:23.807 --> 03:27.247
She was strong, and
she was resilient.

03:28.784 --> 03:29.686
- Elliot, come on.

03:29.786 --> 03:31.422
- [Debora] She
really was a pioneer.

03:31.523 --> 03:33.728
- [Narrator] Ruth
starts the business

03:33.794 --> 03:37.401
with her husband, Elliot,
and friend, Harold Matson.

03:37.535 --> 03:40.274
The two men combine their names,

03:40.406 --> 03:43.113
Matt from Matson
and El from Elliot,

03:43.279 --> 03:45.451
to call the company Mattel.

03:45.551 --> 03:47.421
- [Debora] Given the
convention of the time,

03:47.522 --> 03:49.593
even though Ruth and
Elliot were married,

03:49.692 --> 03:51.630
Ruth's name was not
part of the company.

03:51.696 --> 03:53.801
Whether or not Ruth was
happy with that name,

03:53.801 --> 03:54.903
the name stuck.

03:54.969 --> 03:57.742
- [Narrator] Mattel
will one day become

03:57.809 --> 04:01.617
the largest toy company
in the United States,

04:01.683 --> 04:06.760
worth $8 billion,
selling in over 150 countries,

04:07.829 --> 04:10.501
creating one of the biggest
toy and media franchises

04:10.568 --> 04:15.310
in history and an icon that
revolutionizes the industry.

04:17.849 --> 04:21.355
But right now, they're
selling picture frames.

04:22.725 --> 04:24.529
And when Matson quits,

04:24.596 --> 04:27.969
the Handlers are left to keep
the business going alone.

04:27.969 --> 04:30.107
- [Jordan] Elliot and Ruth
Handler had this really unique

04:30.306 --> 04:31.442
working relationship.

04:31.576 --> 04:33.179
Ruth was the business side,

04:33.279 --> 04:35.518
while Elliot really
was the creative side.

04:35.584 --> 04:38.423
- [Robin] And it was Ruth
absolutely running the company.

04:38.590 --> 04:40.193
And of course, at that time,

04:40.326 --> 04:42.197
women were not
running companies,

04:42.330 --> 04:44.502
much less a
manufacturing company.

04:47.775 --> 04:49.646
- [Narrator] To keep
the business going,

04:49.746 --> 04:52.217
Elliot begins using their
leftover wood scraps

04:52.350 --> 04:54.722
to make dollhouse furniture,

04:55.958 --> 04:59.498
and sales of the dollhouses
soon eclipse the picture frames.

05:00.901 --> 05:05.043
Ruth now sees children as a
new opportunity for Mattel.

05:07.480 --> 05:10.655
- [Robin] Elliot, who
loved musical instruments,

05:10.754 --> 05:14.461
had this idea that he
could do a toy ukulele,

05:14.596 --> 05:16.934
and it didn't make
any real sound

05:16.934 --> 05:18.369
that you would want to hear,

05:18.503 --> 05:19.773
but you could pretend with it.

05:19.906 --> 05:21.710
And they called it
the Uke-A-Doodle.

05:23.947 --> 05:27.354
- [Narrator] The Handlers bet
that their first official toy

05:27.420 --> 05:29.993
will be a hit alternative
to the toys of the day.

05:32.130 --> 05:33.801
- [Christopher] In
the late forties,

05:33.834 --> 05:37.642
kids were playing with pretty
much slightly updated versions

05:37.775 --> 05:40.515
of the toys their
parents and grandparents

05:40.648 --> 05:44.054
had grown up with:
toy vehicles, dolls,

05:44.054 --> 05:46.058
housekeeping, cap guns.

05:46.058 --> 05:48.162
(gunshot blasting)

05:48.162 --> 05:49.498
- [Narrator] But
they have no idea

05:49.666 --> 05:51.135
if there's a market for it.

05:55.778 --> 05:58.684
(whimsical music)

06:01.088 --> 06:03.426
3000 miles from Los Angeles,

06:03.560 --> 06:05.330
30 three-year-old
Merrill Hassenfeld

06:05.564 --> 06:09.071
is a low level executive at his
family's pencil box company.

06:09.939 --> 06:12.344
(Merrill coughing)

06:12.444 --> 06:14.783
- Hassenfeld Brothers
was founded in 1923

06:14.882 --> 06:18.023
by three brothers,
Henry, Hillel, and Herman,

06:18.089 --> 06:21.563
and they were Polish
immigrants that came to the US

06:21.696 --> 06:24.134
and formed a stationery company.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.673
They made pencils, pencil boxes.

06:26.740 --> 06:29.512
Merrill Hassenfeld was the
son of Henry Hassenfeld.

06:30.748 --> 06:32.083
- [Narrator] After
noticing the pencil boxes

06:32.117 --> 06:36.392
looked like tiny medical kits,
Merrill gets a bold idea.

06:36.458 --> 06:39.799
- Merrill, young guy out
of college, says, "Hey,

06:39.899 --> 06:42.137
I see a bigger opportunity
for us to invest

06:42.137 --> 06:44.441
in new machinery,
new technology.

06:44.575 --> 06:45.978
Let's get into
the toy business."

06:46.078 --> 06:49.018
- [Narrator] Merrill
also gives the company

06:49.018 --> 06:50.521
a sleek new name,

06:50.587 --> 06:54.762
abbreviating Hassenfeld
brothers to Hasbro.

06:56.633 --> 06:59.573
But to convince his father
of the potential of toys,

06:59.739 --> 07:01.810
he needs a hit idea.

07:29.498 --> 07:32.838
- It's like a little
potato face man.

07:34.509 --> 07:35.711
- I call it Make a Face.

07:38.884 --> 07:42.257
- [Tim] George Lerner was
an artist from Long Island,

07:42.525 --> 07:45.898
and he came up with the idea
of taking different shapes

07:46.031 --> 07:48.069
and piercing
vegetables with them

07:48.069 --> 07:50.608
and making a funny face kit.

07:50.774 --> 07:52.411
(suspenseful music)

07:52.511 --> 07:54.682
- [Narrator] Merrill
takes it to his father.

08:01.930 --> 08:03.934
- So you put the pieces in.

08:10.079 --> 08:13.353
Families have enough to be
able to afford a $1 toy,

08:13.553 --> 08:15.824
so let's take advantage.

08:18.195 --> 08:20.768
- [Narrator] Merrill
Hassenfeld will go on to create

08:20.834 --> 08:24.141
some of the most
revolutionary toys of all time

08:24.207 --> 08:28.750
and build an empire worth
more than $5 billion,

08:33.593 --> 08:36.031
(suspenseful music)

08:37.267 --> 08:39.906
- [Narrator] In 1952, Merrill
Hassenfeld is betting big

08:40.006 --> 08:42.310
on a toy to lead the
family's business

08:42.310 --> 08:44.147
into a wildly new direction.

08:45.049 --> 08:46.953
- [Kirk] Merrill had the vision

08:47.053 --> 08:49.793
and that strength of
character to persevere

08:49.926 --> 08:52.565
and prove to his
family that, hey,

08:52.665 --> 08:54.970
this is the right
direction we should go in.

08:55.036 --> 08:57.709
- [Narrator] With his
father's blessing,

08:57.742 --> 09:02.183
Hassenfeld buys George Lerner's
Make a Face for $7,000.

09:05.724 --> 09:08.797
Within months, the
toy is in production.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.468
To make the kit affordable,

09:11.636 --> 09:13.541
the two dozen facial accessories

09:13.640 --> 09:15.678
are made of an
innovative material.

09:15.778 --> 09:19.151
- Toys prior to World War
II were made of cloth,

09:19.217 --> 09:21.857
they were made of wood, and
they were made of metal.

09:21.956 --> 09:24.127
After World War II,
plastic took over.

09:26.098 --> 09:27.100
It was cheap.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.203
It was available.

09:28.302 --> 09:30.473
- [Narrator] Also
keeping expenses down,

09:30.641 --> 09:32.979
it doesn't come with a head.

09:33.012 --> 09:36.787
- You provided the head in the
form of produce, a vegetable.

09:36.920 --> 09:39.091
- [Narrator] With
low production costs,

09:39.191 --> 09:42.698
Hassenfeld can price
the kit at just $1,

09:42.798 --> 09:45.236
but when Merrill
presents it to stores,

09:45.236 --> 09:47.575
he's met with resistance.

09:47.675 --> 09:50.748
- It had to get past
the people that thought

09:50.848 --> 09:53.854
wasting food was something
you shouldn't do.

09:53.954 --> 09:57.160
- [Narrator] Using food
as a toy is a tough sell

09:57.227 --> 10:00.066
to Americans who recently
lived through food shortages

10:00.099 --> 10:03.541
during the Depression and
rationing during World War II.

10:04.374 --> 10:07.582
So Hassenfeld finds a
revolutionary way to bypass

10:07.681 --> 10:12.223
the adults and market
directly to children.

10:12.323 --> 10:15.998
- On April 30th, 1952,
Hasbro did something

10:16.098 --> 10:18.737
that no toy company
had ever done before

10:18.837 --> 10:22.243
and that is advertising
a toy on television.

10:23.747 --> 10:25.250
- What's new, Hasbro?

10:25.250 --> 10:27.153
- Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head

10:27.220 --> 10:30.861
with their own cars and
trailers, that's what's new.

10:30.994 --> 10:32.497
- It wouldn't be the best ad,

10:32.497 --> 10:34.735
and it wasn't the
most sophisticated,

10:34.802 --> 10:38.342
but it did make Mr.
Potato Head a success.

10:38.409 --> 10:41.014
- [Rachel] It was really
genius marketing at the time.

10:41.114 --> 10:42.685
Kids saw it, and they
were telling their parents

10:42.818 --> 10:44.889
to run out and go
get it for them.

10:44.989 --> 10:46.793
- [Narrator] Hasbro's
groundbreaking approach

10:46.993 --> 10:48.931
transforms the industry.

10:49.030 --> 10:50.499
- [Tim] It's an
absolute game changer.

10:50.734 --> 10:53.974
It made a seismic shift in
the fact that toy companies

10:54.040 --> 10:57.180
could now reach their target
market, which was kids.

11:00.019 --> 11:01.957
- [Narrator] Within its
first year on the market,

11:02.023 --> 11:05.931
Mr. Potato Head earns the
company $4 million,

11:07.166 --> 11:09.204
$39 million today.

11:10.741 --> 11:15.584
- Mr. Potato Head was unlike
anything else on the market.

11:16.285 --> 11:18.557
- [Narrator] Hassenfeld is
promoted to president of Hasbro,

11:18.790 --> 11:22.330
which is now earning more than
the original pencil business,

11:22.430 --> 11:25.571
but he knows he needs
more than a one hit wonder

11:25.771 --> 11:27.708
to stay on top.

11:31.783 --> 11:35.223
(suspenseful music)

11:35.323 --> 11:37.394
Meanwhile, Ruth
and Elliot Handler

11:37.460 --> 11:41.803
have gambled Mattel's
future on a toy ukulele.

11:42.905 --> 11:45.443
- [Christopher] It sort
of set them as initially

11:45.443 --> 11:47.948
a maker of musical toys.

11:48.048 --> 11:50.988
- [Narrator] In a year,
they make $30,000,

11:51.088 --> 11:54.261
more than a quarter
of a million today.

11:54.361 --> 11:57.801
A modest hit, but
sales quickly decline.

11:59.104 --> 12:01.676
Ruth knows she
needs another idea

12:01.809 --> 12:04.114
if she wants to
keep up with Hasbro.

12:05.216 --> 12:07.387
- Mattel and Hasbro had
an interesting rivalry

12:07.387 --> 12:08.991
from the beginning, really.

12:09.090 --> 12:10.762
Like any corporation
that competes with

12:10.961 --> 12:12.130
another corporation,

12:12.230 --> 12:14.802
the one you're competing
with makes you better.

12:15.938 --> 12:18.142
- [Narrator] To
launch their next toy.

12:18.208 --> 12:21.883
Ruth takes a page directly
from her competitors playbook.

12:22.985 --> 12:24.956
- So it's a variety
show hosted by kids?

12:25.089 --> 12:26.927
- What's the name of the show?

12:27.093 --> 12:29.733
- "The Mickey Mouse Club."

12:29.832 --> 12:31.536
- [Elliot] And to
sponsor this show?

12:31.536 --> 12:33.339
- $500,000.

12:38.115 --> 12:39.986
- You got any cheaper shows?

12:40.119 --> 12:43.526
- No, we want "The
Mickey Mouse Club."

12:46.131 --> 12:48.169
- They're going to
advertise every 15 minutes,

12:48.202 --> 12:50.574
but you have to buy a
year's worth of advertising,

12:50.574 --> 12:53.178
and that's going
to cost $500,000.

12:53.245 --> 12:56.686
She was betting the entire
net worth of her company

12:56.853 --> 12:58.088
on advertising on television

12:58.222 --> 13:00.460
in a way that had
never been done

13:00.460 --> 13:02.931
on a show that no one had seen.

13:05.904 --> 13:08.276
- The product Mattel
risks the company on

13:08.409 --> 13:12.083
is a toy rifle
called the Burp Gun.

13:12.150 --> 13:13.720
- [Spokesperson] That
Thunder Burp looks like real,

13:13.920 --> 13:14.923
sounds like real.

13:15.122 --> 13:15.958
(gunshots firing)

13:16.124 --> 13:18.195
You can tell it's Mattel.

13:18.195 --> 13:19.398
It's swell.

13:19.398 --> 13:21.135
(gunshots firing)

13:21.168 --> 13:24.474
- [Narrator] It's the first
time a toy ad appears on TV

13:24.474 --> 13:26.311
outside of the Christmas season.

13:28.115 --> 13:31.455
And when "The Mickey Mouse
Club" becomes a huge hit,

13:31.455 --> 13:33.827
sales of the Burp Gun explode.

13:33.893 --> 13:35.931
- They have more orders
than they can fill.

13:36.031 --> 13:37.635
You can thank Ruth
Handler for the fact that

13:37.901 --> 13:43.814
children will now whine and
complain and beg their parents

13:43.913 --> 13:46.285
for toys that they see
advertise on television.

13:47.186 --> 13:48.724
- [Narrator] But just
like the Uke-A-Doodle,

13:48.923 --> 13:50.794
sales soon plummet.

13:51.328 --> 13:53.634
The Handlers haven't
found their long lasting

13:53.634 --> 13:55.236
iconic toy yet.

13:58.008 --> 14:00.914
- The toy business is
a fashion business.

14:01.048 --> 14:03.119
It's a business that is dynamic.

14:03.318 --> 14:04.955
It changes constantly.

14:06.158 --> 14:07.962
- One day, something
could be in,

14:08.062 --> 14:10.634
and three months later,
it's completely out,

14:10.634 --> 14:12.103
and no one's buying a thing.

14:13.907 --> 14:15.645
- [Narrator] Ruth
desperately needs a toy

14:15.645 --> 14:17.080
with staying power.

14:21.656 --> 14:26.733
And in the winter of 1956, she
finds unexpected inspiration

14:26.733 --> 14:29.638
during a family
trip to Switzerland.

14:29.638 --> 14:31.877
- Ruth and her
daughter, Barbara,

14:32.043 --> 14:34.982
we're walking by a window.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.420
Ruth saw her daughter's
interest in the doll,

14:37.420 --> 14:39.258
and something clicked.

14:39.357 --> 14:42.698
- [Tim] The Bild Lilli
doll came scantily clad,

14:42.965 --> 14:46.839
and certainly she was more
of a bachelor party gag gift

14:46.973 --> 14:49.211
than a gift for little girls.

14:49.277 --> 14:53.152
- She realized that she
could build a doll like this

14:53.252 --> 14:54.989
that would be a
play thing for girls

14:55.122 --> 14:58.428
rather than kind
of a joke for men.

15:01.536 --> 15:03.139
- [Narrator] But
especially for a company

15:03.238 --> 15:06.078
that made millions
on a toy machine gun,

15:06.211 --> 15:09.318
Ruth's vision is
a huge departure.

15:09.384 --> 15:12.391
- Ruth, no mother is
going to buy her daughter

15:12.391 --> 15:13.425
a doll with breasts.

15:18.168 --> 15:20.540
(suspenseful music)

15:24.548 --> 15:25.984
- [Narrator] Toy
maker, Ruth Handler,

15:26.117 --> 15:28.122
is desperate for
a long lasting hit

15:28.255 --> 15:30.828
for her fledgling
company, Mattel,

15:30.994 --> 15:32.932
and she has a bizarre idea

15:33.165 --> 15:37.406
based on a bachelor party gag
gift brought back from Europe.

15:43.553 --> 15:44.588
- What do you think?

15:48.162 --> 15:49.030
- Cute.

15:55.710 --> 15:58.149
- [Robin] Ruth's entire
research and design department

15:58.315 --> 15:59.752
were men, and the men said,

16:00.052 --> 16:02.692
"Ruth, you don't know
what you're talking about.

16:02.692 --> 16:04.929
Go back to running the company.

16:05.162 --> 16:08.369
Mothers will never buy their
daughters a doll with breasts."

16:08.468 --> 16:10.306
- And she wouldn't accept that.

16:12.310 --> 16:14.214
- [Narrator] Ruth tasks
engineer, Jack Ryan,

16:14.347 --> 16:16.820
to help reinvent
the doll's design

16:16.820 --> 16:19.659
with unprecedented
attention to detail.

16:19.692 --> 16:23.098
- [Robin] Ruth goes to the top
design school in Los Angeles,

16:23.198 --> 16:26.272
and she wants the most
realistic, tiny clothes

16:26.371 --> 16:29.310
that are going to
have tiny little snaps

16:29.477 --> 16:31.414
and beautiful little zippers.

16:35.055 --> 16:37.427
- [Narrator] Ruth even hires
famed child psychologist,

16:37.493 --> 16:40.399
Ernest Dichter, to
conduct focus group tests.

16:41.502 --> 16:43.472
- At the time, most of
the dolls on the market

16:43.472 --> 16:44.909
were baby dolls.

16:45.075 --> 16:47.080
So what Ruth saw was a gap,

16:47.179 --> 16:49.050
and what she wanted
to create was a doll

16:49.117 --> 16:51.789
that could represent women
at a more mature stage

16:51.789 --> 16:53.358
in their life.

16:53.392 --> 16:56.699
- The Barbie doll's body was
the first thing that moms saw

16:56.766 --> 17:00.874
and said, "Oh no, she
literally looks like a hooker."

17:01.141 --> 17:03.947
- Is this a gift for my
daughter or for my husband?

17:04.147 --> 17:06.786
(women laughing)

17:08.790 --> 17:11.227
- [Ruth] Ruth Handler
didn't like to lose,

17:11.361 --> 17:13.900
just as she didn't
like to back off

17:13.900 --> 17:16.004
or be told she
couldn't do something,

17:16.104 --> 17:17.875
and that's what it takes
for an entrepreneur

17:17.875 --> 17:20.179
to build a company like Mattel.

17:22.551 --> 17:25.156
(intense music)

17:25.256 --> 17:26.659
- [Narrator] Meanwhile,
Hasbro president,

17:26.759 --> 17:29.732
Merrill Hassenfeld,
hasn't had a major hit

17:29.732 --> 17:31.001
since Mr. Potato Head.

17:31.134 --> 17:34.173
- [Tim] Hasbro was losing money,

17:34.307 --> 17:36.011
and Merrill was
looking for a toy

17:36.144 --> 17:38.616
to lift it out of its doldrums.

17:40.119 --> 17:42.691
(cartoon music)

17:52.544 --> 17:55.450
There was a hit movie with
"The Absent-Minded Professor."

17:55.517 --> 17:58.957
The character created this
substance called Flubber,

17:59.123 --> 18:00.492
which is flying rubber.

18:01.696 --> 18:04.034
Two years later, they
were planning a sequel

18:04.167 --> 18:05.837
called the "Son of Flubber."

18:07.173 --> 18:08.943
So Merrill Hassenfeld thought,

18:08.943 --> 18:11.782
I'm going to tie in
with this sequel.

18:13.185 --> 18:15.925
- [Narrator] Hassenfeld
licenses the rights to Flubber

18:15.925 --> 18:17.794
and creates a toy version.

18:18.896 --> 18:21.435
- Flubber was a new
space age material

18:21.502 --> 18:25.877
that stretches, pulls, you
can roll it into a ball

18:25.877 --> 18:27.547
and bounce it.

18:27.581 --> 18:29.786
- [Narrator] But within
months of hitting the market,

18:29.786 --> 18:31.856
the Flubber bubble bursts.

18:35.162 --> 18:37.735
- There were reports
of kids getting rashes

18:37.735 --> 18:39.304
and having sore throats.

18:39.337 --> 18:43.045
- That started resulting in
claims against the company,

18:43.245 --> 18:44.348
liability issues.

18:44.480 --> 18:47.287
- [Narrator] No one
is seriously hurt,

18:47.386 --> 18:49.859
but it's a major
setback for Hassenfeld.

18:49.892 --> 18:53.633
- They had no choice but to
pull it and to get rid of it.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.169
- [Narrator] And
according to legend,

18:55.302 --> 18:56.605
there is another problem.

18:56.739 --> 18:58.676
- The myth around
Flubber is that

18:58.743 --> 19:01.549
Hasbro tried all these methods
to get rid of this stuff.

19:01.615 --> 19:05.089
So they were going to dump it
at sea, but Flubber floats.

19:05.189 --> 19:06.224
They were going to
burn it, and they said,

19:06.391 --> 19:07.528
"oh, we can't do that."

19:07.627 --> 19:10.667
- Finally, the one
legend I do believe,

19:10.734 --> 19:13.439
is that all the material
was brought back to Hasbro,

19:13.506 --> 19:16.579
and they buried Flubber
under the parking lot.

19:18.248 --> 19:23.325
- [Narrator] Hasbro loses
nearly $5 million on Flubber,

19:23.926 --> 19:25.964
44 million in today's money.

19:26.264 --> 19:28.804
- The fiasco that was
Flubber really left Hasbro

19:28.804 --> 19:30.139
with a black eye.

19:30.239 --> 19:32.711
Merrill had to come up
with a way out and fast.

19:36.752 --> 19:38.523
- [Narrator] But Hasbro
isn't the only one

19:38.656 --> 19:41.529
with a potential
multimillion dollar loss.

19:41.662 --> 19:43.231
- Let's put a few of the boxes

19:43.298 --> 19:45.537
around the outside here
on the bottom facing out.

19:48.843 --> 19:53.018
- Toy Fair every year is
the trade show that places

19:53.285 --> 19:56.759
new products for the holiday
season with retailers,

19:56.826 --> 20:00.299
and it is the make or
break commercial endeavor

20:00.466 --> 20:02.470
for most toy companies.

20:02.537 --> 20:04.341
- [Narrator] After three
years of development,

20:04.440 --> 20:06.780
Ruth Handler is
finally ready to launch

20:06.846 --> 20:11.856
Mattel's unprecedented new
doll, now named Barbie.

20:18.970 --> 20:21.174
- [Robin] Ruth names
the doll Barbie

20:21.307 --> 20:24.247
after her daughter, Barbara.

20:24.347 --> 20:26.786
They went through a
number of iterations

20:26.852 --> 20:29.457
and finally decided
that Barbie was the one

20:29.591 --> 20:31.160
that seemed to fit the best.

20:31.294 --> 20:33.098
- [Narrator] Ruth
lands a meeting

20:33.098 --> 20:34.869
with one of the
largest retailers in

20:34.869 --> 20:36.204
the world at the time,

20:36.304 --> 20:39.310
Lou Kelso, the head
buyer from Sears.

20:41.849 --> 20:46.091
- We've just added
another $125,000 dollars

20:46.091 --> 20:48.428
to our $1 million
advertising budget.

20:51.468 --> 20:53.739
Take one as a
sample if you like.

21:00.319 --> 21:02.490
- You're out of your mind.

21:05.797 --> 21:07.535
- [Debora] The buyer's
thought this wouldn't work.

21:07.634 --> 21:10.473
Girls are supposed to
play with baby dolls.

21:10.607 --> 21:13.012
- [Robin] Ruth has
poured everything

21:13.012 --> 21:14.515
into making this doll.

21:14.615 --> 21:17.086
This was the only toy
she had invested in,

21:17.086 --> 21:20.093
and she is devastated.

21:21.027 --> 21:23.566
Elliot says it was the only
time he ever saw her cry.

21:28.643 --> 21:29.846
(suspenseful music)

21:29.978 --> 21:31.582
- [Narrator] Without
a buyer for Barbie

21:31.749 --> 21:33.620
at the 1959 Toy Fair,

21:33.686 --> 21:36.960
the Handlers must find another
way to sell their supply

21:36.960 --> 21:39.063
or lose millions.

21:42.036 --> 21:44.241
- The toy buyers are
the one saying to her,

21:44.307 --> 21:47.213
"No one is going to
buy a doll with breasts

21:47.313 --> 21:51.321
for their little
girls," and Ruth pushed.

21:51.454 --> 21:53.793
She pursued, and
she believed in it.

21:53.860 --> 21:56.999
- And Ruth decided to
bet on the little girls

21:57.099 --> 21:59.771
convincing their parents
that this was okay.

22:01.742 --> 22:03.378
- [Narrator] She
doubles down on Mattel's

22:03.512 --> 22:05.583
million dollar
advertising budget

22:05.650 --> 22:08.455
in order to sell Barbie
directly to the children.

22:08.623 --> 22:12.496
♪ Beautiful Barbie ♪

22:12.631 --> 22:16.805
♪ I'll make believe
that I am you ♪

22:18.041 --> 22:21.415
- In the commercial, the
little girl in the song says,

22:21.481 --> 22:24.655
"I'll make believe that
I'm just like you."

22:24.721 --> 22:29.364
So the doll is actually made
human in this commercial

22:29.497 --> 22:31.836
in a way that girls
totally relate.

22:31.936 --> 22:34.708
- The buyers thought
this wouldn't work,

22:34.775 --> 22:39.117
little girls voted otherwise,
and Barbie just exploded.

22:39.383 --> 22:42.824
- [Narrator] Over 300,000
are sold in the first year,

22:42.924 --> 22:46.331
more than any other
toy in history.

22:46.565 --> 22:51.575
- Barbie was, by most counts,
the most successful toy ever.

22:52.677 --> 22:53.646
- [Narrator] Ruth and
Elliot then innovate

22:53.779 --> 22:55.851
a new way to keep sales going:

22:55.917 --> 22:59.992
alternate versions of the doll
with distinct accessories.

23:00.058 --> 23:03.600
- The genius of Barbie is
that Barbie was really not

23:03.799 --> 23:05.903
a one-time purchase.

23:05.970 --> 23:09.010
So if Barbie is a cheerleader,
she needs pompoms.

23:09.076 --> 23:11.548
If Barbie has a dream house,
you need all the stuff

23:11.682 --> 23:12.818
that goes in the dream house.

23:12.951 --> 23:14.454
- Barbie itself was very cheap,

23:14.554 --> 23:15.890
and then the clothes
and accessories

23:15.957 --> 23:18.061
are what you really needed
to enhance the play pattern.

23:18.128 --> 23:21.100
- Beyond just money, Ruth
really wanted to change

23:21.100 --> 23:22.871
the trajectory of toys.

23:25.810 --> 23:30.887
- [Narrator] In 1961, the
Mattel CEO ups the ante again.

23:31.689 --> 23:32.891
- He is Barbie's boyfriend.

23:32.991 --> 23:35.730
- [Debora] There was
such a customer demand

23:35.863 --> 23:37.299
that Barbie have
a man in her life

23:37.567 --> 23:42.043
that Mattel did come out with
Ken, also very good looking.

23:42.109 --> 23:45.383
- [Narrator] The first
Ken doll costs $3.50,

23:45.449 --> 23:50.158
nearly $30 today, and
wears just a swimsuit.

23:50.459 --> 23:52.631
- [Debora] Both Ken and
Barbie were named after

23:52.764 --> 23:54.534
Ruth and Elliot's own children.

23:55.837 --> 23:58.743
- [Narrator] The demand for
Barbie and Ken reaches a frenzy,

23:58.843 --> 24:01.481
but a new movement
is on the horizon,

24:01.582 --> 24:04.522
and it threatens to
topple the dream house.

24:04.721 --> 24:07.727
(suspenseful music)

24:08.863 --> 24:12.169
By 1963, Merrill
Hassenfeld is struggling

24:12.469 --> 24:16.612
to keep Hasbro afloat,
desperate for a big idea.

24:17.914 --> 24:20.553
- The Flubber experience
certainly put Hasbro

24:20.753 --> 24:22.022
back on its heels.

24:22.089 --> 24:24.895
- [Azhelle] Mattel was really
successful with Barbie,

24:25.028 --> 24:26.899
and Hasbro wanted to compete,

24:26.999 --> 24:28.903
so they needed to come
up with something.

24:34.748 --> 24:36.753
- This is Stan Weston,

24:36.885 --> 24:38.789
who is behind some
of the design work.

24:40.158 --> 24:42.797
- [Narrator] Stan Weston is
an independent licensing agent

24:42.897 --> 24:45.870
with a new toy idea
that could rival Barbie,

24:46.037 --> 24:48.208
but for a different audience.

24:48.274 --> 24:52.917
- This is the world's
first movable fighting man.

24:54.186 --> 24:57.060
- Boys have always
played with toy soldiers.

24:57.192 --> 24:59.965
In the 20th century,
for like 50 cents,

25:00.065 --> 25:02.838
you could buy bags of
little green army men.

25:02.904 --> 25:05.142
- [Stan] Everything from
guns to boots to dog tags

25:05.208 --> 25:07.881
will be perfect scale
replicas of the real thing.

25:07.881 --> 25:08.750
So this doll-

25:08.916 --> 25:12.056
- Let's not call it a doll.

25:12.056 --> 25:13.324
- Right, it's not.

25:13.526 --> 25:15.062
It's a play man.

25:16.698 --> 25:19.572
- The hurdle was getting
over the fact that

25:19.671 --> 25:22.811
"a boy will never
play with a doll."

25:25.115 --> 25:26.985
- It's an action figure.

25:34.100 --> 25:37.140
- Every person inside Hasbro
that heard about this idea

25:37.239 --> 25:39.276
thought it would be
the end of Hasbro.

25:41.114 --> 25:43.318
- [Narrator] But
Hassenfeld forges ahead

25:43.586 --> 25:46.592
and even takes a page out
of the Barbie playbook.

25:46.692 --> 25:48.729
- Just think of
the play potential:

25:49.965 --> 25:52.704
thousands of accessories, each
sold separately of course,

25:52.871 --> 25:56.178
machine guns, bazookas.

25:56.277 --> 25:59.919
- It is a multi-layered
sales principle.

25:59.985 --> 26:02.824
You're making an investment
in your consumer,

26:02.991 --> 26:04.628
who's going to keep on buying.

26:04.728 --> 26:06.599
- All right, it's
like a Barbie doll.

26:06.732 --> 26:07.967
- [Merrill] It's not a doll.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.236
It's not a doll.

26:11.107 --> 26:12.644
- So what's his name?

26:13.612 --> 26:15.182
- Hasbro was struggling
with the name.

26:15.282 --> 26:18.254
They had given the
soldier the name Rocky.

26:20.258 --> 26:25.069
- His name is G.I. Joe.

26:25.135 --> 26:30.814
- G.I. Joe was part of
the name of a 1945 film,

26:31.013 --> 26:32.450
the "Story of G.I. Joe,"

26:32.617 --> 26:34.821
and to make them look rugged

26:34.921 --> 26:37.627
so that you'd never
mistake them for Ken,

26:38.929 --> 26:43.038
they put a scar on the upper
right cheek of G.I. Joe.

26:43.138 --> 26:46.712
And so he was going
to be a tough guy.

26:46.879 --> 26:49.250
Good-looking, but a tough guy.

26:50.018 --> 26:52.557
- [Narrator] And there's
another innovative difference

26:52.757 --> 26:54.293
from Barbie.

26:54.326 --> 26:58.435
- What made G.I. Joe distinctive
was that he was articulated

26:58.636 --> 27:01.642
in over 21 places.

27:01.775 --> 27:04.515
The neck and the
shoulders, the elbows,

27:04.648 --> 27:06.785
even the wrists
would move around.

27:08.054 --> 27:11.027
- [Narrator] In 1964,
Hassenfeld goes into production

27:11.194 --> 27:13.264
on his moveable action figure.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.839
- Hasbro really needed
G.I. Joe to be a success.

27:16.939 --> 27:19.678
G.I. Joe would make
or break the company.

27:19.744 --> 27:22.383
- [Narrator] But the night
before G.I. Joe's debut

27:22.383 --> 27:24.822
at the 1964 Toy Fair,

27:24.921 --> 27:27.961
Hassenfeld realizes
there is a big problem.

27:37.112 --> 27:41.221
Stan Weston, the man who came
up with the idea for G.I. Joe,

27:41.221 --> 27:42.957
still owns him.

27:49.003 --> 27:50.305
(suspenseful music)

27:52.175 --> 27:54.648
Just before G.I. Joe debuts

27:54.781 --> 27:57.453
at the all-important
1964 Toy Fair,

27:57.687 --> 28:02.730
Merrill Hassenfeld discovers
Hasbro doesn't own the rights.

28:04.433 --> 28:08.408
He has no choice but to make
an 11th hour deal with creator,

28:08.474 --> 28:12.449
Stan Weston, or else G.I.
Joe and the millions invested

28:12.449 --> 28:14.086
will be lost.

28:15.455 --> 28:18.428
- I can offer you a 1% royalty
of any profits we might make.

28:20.733 --> 28:21.434
- Five percent.

28:22.937 --> 28:24.774
- If I don't see an upside,
Hassenfeld Toys is finished,

28:24.975 --> 28:26.612
and Joe is dead.

28:26.778 --> 28:29.350
You'll have 5% of nothing.

28:29.350 --> 28:30.720
- How about three?

28:33.826 --> 28:36.832
- Merrill said, "Look,
you're free to take this

28:36.932 --> 28:39.303
anywhere else want,
but here's my offer."

28:42.109 --> 28:46.050
- I can offer a hundred
thousand dollars straight up.

28:48.221 --> 28:49.390
Think about it.

28:51.828 --> 28:54.400
A hundred thousand
dollars in your pocket,

28:55.970 --> 29:01.013
or you can just risk it
all on a doll for boys.

29:08.127 --> 29:11.167
- To a struggling or
even successful inventor

29:11.300 --> 29:13.038
like Stan Weston
was at the time,

29:13.137 --> 29:15.577
it made sense to take
the money and run,

29:15.577 --> 29:17.279
but it was a bad idea.

29:21.420 --> 29:24.628
- [Narrator] The Toy Fair
gets G.I. Joe on the shelves,

29:24.861 --> 29:28.301
but initial orders don't even
cover the costs of production.

29:28.401 --> 29:31.408
So Hassenfeld comes
up with a bold scheme

29:31.408 --> 29:33.478
to jumpstart sales.

29:34.914 --> 29:36.317
- [Kirk] He tells his
New York sales rep,

29:36.417 --> 29:40.125
"I want you to go to every
Woolworth's in Manhattan

29:41.160 --> 29:44.768
and buy up all the
inventory of G.I. Joe."

29:44.901 --> 29:47.841
His salesforce
clean the shelves.

29:47.907 --> 29:52.416
Woolworth's thinks they've
got a hit on their hands,

29:52.416 --> 29:54.119
places a reorder.

29:55.455 --> 29:59.330
Hasbro broadcasts that to
the rest of the retail world.

29:59.330 --> 30:00.833
The rest is history.

30:02.469 --> 30:04.707
♪ G.I. Joe G.I. Joe

30:04.841 --> 30:06.344
Fighting man
from head to toe ♪

30:06.444 --> 30:09.183
- [Narrator] With help
from a patriotic jingle

30:09.216 --> 30:14.093
and aggressive TV advertising,
G.I. Joe becomes a sensation.

30:14.193 --> 30:18.603
First year sales top
16 million units.

30:18.603 --> 30:20.806
G.I. Joe elevates Hasbro

30:20.906 --> 30:23.846
to the number two toy
company in America,

30:23.946 --> 30:26.150
and they're gunning
for number one.

30:27.620 --> 30:31.161
(suspenseful music)

30:31.227 --> 30:34.668
Meanwhile, Mattel's
Barbie adds bendable legs

30:34.668 --> 30:36.572
and swivel hips to keep up.

30:36.605 --> 30:39.110
- Hasbro and Mattel were
learning from each other.

30:39.209 --> 30:42.116
I think Hasbro
taught Mattel a lot

30:42.182 --> 30:45.856
about how to make their
Barbie figure more posable.

30:46.057 --> 30:48.696
(crowd shouting)

30:48.962 --> 30:51.401
- [Narrator] But as culture
changes through the sixties

30:51.500 --> 30:53.706
and the Women's
Movement sweeps America,

30:53.706 --> 30:56.745
Barbie comes under fire again.

30:56.745 --> 30:59.551
- [Debora] Barbie was
generally despised

30:59.551 --> 31:01.956
by the feminists of the 1960s.

31:02.122 --> 31:03.024
- [Robin] Betty Friedan's book,

31:03.124 --> 31:04.728
"The Feminine
Mystique," had come out.

31:04.961 --> 31:08.501
Gloria Steinem and you know,
women were making great changes

31:08.501 --> 31:09.771
in this country,

31:09.871 --> 31:13.178
and here's this doll
that seems to embody

31:13.244 --> 31:17.621
every sexist image and
idea that is out there

31:17.621 --> 31:18.856
in the culture.

31:18.956 --> 31:21.093
- [Narrator] Ruth
Handler answers critics

31:21.227 --> 31:23.164
with another
groundbreaking move:

31:23.297 --> 31:26.437
launching a new
range of Barbies

31:27.507 --> 31:29.309
styled as career women.

31:29.309 --> 31:32.015
(upbeat music)

31:33.151 --> 31:34.120
- [Edward] Over the
next couple of years,

31:34.286 --> 31:36.124
Barbie has hundreds of careers.

31:36.157 --> 31:39.229
She even becomes an astronaut
and actually lands on the moon

31:39.296 --> 31:42.804
years before the actual
moon landing takes place.

31:42.904 --> 31:44.273
- [Laurie] You kind of grow up,

31:44.306 --> 31:45.543
and you think you're going to
get married, have children,

31:45.643 --> 31:47.413
be a mom, clean the
house, cook dinner.

31:47.547 --> 31:50.285
And Barbie is
letting girls know,

31:50.418 --> 31:52.356
a lot more to life than that.

31:52.456 --> 31:54.895
She changed the way
little girls think.

31:55.028 --> 31:56.932
- [Narrator] Ruth
hits on a new formula:

31:57.032 --> 31:59.504
a toy that can change
with the times.

31:59.571 --> 32:03.913
She even updates Barbie's
eyes from a coy glance

32:04.079 --> 32:05.415
to a confident stare

32:05.516 --> 32:07.219
and responds to the
Civil Rights Movement

32:07.319 --> 32:11.127
with an African-American
doll, Christie, in 1968.

32:11.227 --> 32:15.235
- Ruth Handler is a
tremendous innovator

32:15.301 --> 32:18.074
and continued to innovate
throughout her entire life.

32:18.174 --> 32:20.980
She recognized needs
and created products

32:21.147 --> 32:22.750
to satisfy those needs.

32:23.017 --> 32:28.361
- [Narrator] Sales hit a
staggering $180 million in 1966,

32:28.494 --> 32:31.367
1.5 billion in today's dollars.

32:31.433 --> 32:36.579
And Barbie's turnaround comes
just at Hasbro's G.I Joe

32:36.579 --> 32:39.083
also faces changing times.

32:39.216 --> 32:40.451
- [Yohuru] When
G.I. Joe comes out,

32:40.485 --> 32:44.460
it harkens back to this
notion of the American soldier

32:44.493 --> 32:48.134
fighting against the forces
of evil in far-flung places.

32:48.234 --> 32:51.508
That changes over the
course of the 1960s.

32:51.575 --> 32:54.548
And as the war in Vietnam
becomes more of a quagmire,

32:54.614 --> 32:59.090
people begin to associate
the toys themselves

32:59.223 --> 33:01.929
with the unpopularity
of that war.

33:02.128 --> 33:04.835
(bombs exploding)

33:04.835 --> 33:07.841
- [Narrator] In
1968, the Vietnam War

33:08.007 --> 33:09.476
sees its deadliest year.

33:10.546 --> 33:13.084
- [Kirk] The Tet Offensive
occurs in 1968.

33:13.150 --> 33:17.492
In response to that, parents
start to react negatively

33:17.526 --> 33:18.963
to G.I. Joe.

33:19.631 --> 33:22.102
- [Narrator] Sales of
G.I. Joe plummet so fast

33:22.168 --> 33:27.212
that after just four years,
Hasbro halts production.

33:28.047 --> 33:28.849
- [Kirk] So what Hasbro does is

33:28.849 --> 33:30.653
they quickly rebrand G.I. Joe.

33:30.653 --> 33:33.659
(suspenseful music)

33:40.271 --> 33:42.275
- So what, he quit the army?

33:43.411 --> 33:46.450
- We'll call him the Adventurer.

33:48.689 --> 33:51.828
- Good luck, Adventurer Joe.

33:57.673 --> 33:59.711
- G.I. Joe was no
longer a soldier.

33:59.811 --> 34:02.750
Instead of making him
go into combat missions,

34:02.750 --> 34:04.554
G.I. Joe became an explorer.

34:06.725 --> 34:10.600
- [Kirk] It's not as explosive
as the brand once was,

34:10.666 --> 34:13.204
but they're still generating
lots of sales revenue,

34:13.404 --> 34:14.306
lots of profits.

34:14.439 --> 34:16.344
- [Narrator] By the early 1970s,

34:16.443 --> 34:19.651
Hasbro pulls back from
the brink of disaster

34:23.859 --> 34:26.865
(suspenseful music)

34:28.467 --> 34:32.743
Ruth Handler has spent her
career battling controversy,

34:34.079 --> 34:35.482
but by the late seventies,

34:35.582 --> 34:38.221
there's one brewing
inside Mattel

34:38.287 --> 34:42.228
that threatens to upend
everything she's worked for.

34:48.608 --> 34:50.546
- Mattel was now under fire

34:50.612 --> 34:52.750
from the Securities
and Exchange Commission

34:52.850 --> 34:56.290
for falsifying some
of it's accounting,

34:56.357 --> 34:58.829
making things look rosier
than they really were.

35:00.264 --> 35:03.137
It all went back
to Ruth Handler.

35:28.287 --> 35:30.759
- Ruth is indicted
for securities fraud

35:30.793 --> 35:34.667
because they were lying about
what their stock was worth.

35:36.538 --> 35:39.443
(camera clicking)

35:41.815 --> 35:44.252
She felt very betrayed,

35:45.522 --> 35:49.496
and she laid the blame on
senior management for the fraud.

35:49.564 --> 35:53.739
- [Narrator] In 1978, Ruth
Handler is put on trial.

35:53.805 --> 35:58.481
If convicted, she faces
up to 41 years in prison.

35:58.548 --> 36:00.418
- [Robin] The trial got
quite a bit of attention,

36:00.519 --> 36:05.261
and she decides to
plead nolo contendere,

36:05.428 --> 36:07.165
which means no contest.

36:07.298 --> 36:09.737
Luckily for her, she had a judge

36:09.804 --> 36:14.046
who gave her community
service and a fine.

36:14.279 --> 36:17.486
- [Narrator] Even so, there
is no going back to Mattel.

36:17.586 --> 36:20.258
Ruth and Elliot
Handler are forced out

36:20.425 --> 36:22.395
of the company they founded.

36:22.462 --> 36:24.935
- [Robin] They might as
well have cut her heart out

36:24.967 --> 36:28.441
as tell her that she could
no longer be a part of Mattel

36:28.608 --> 36:30.579
in any way, lose her baby.

36:32.583 --> 36:35.622
(suspenseful music)

36:37.626 --> 36:39.897
- [Narrator] At the same
time, Merrill Hassenfeld's

36:39.997 --> 36:43.605
signature toy faces
its own mortal threat.

36:44.574 --> 36:47.245
Sales of the 12 inch G.I. Joe,

36:47.345 --> 36:50.953
the gold standard of
action figures, plummet.

36:50.986 --> 36:54.927
- G.I. Joe has to retool,
rethink about where it's going.

36:54.994 --> 36:58.569
And so G.I. Joe downsizes
from the 12 inch figure

36:58.602 --> 37:04.914
to an eight inch action figure,
and they call him Super Joe.

37:05.448 --> 37:07.219
- [Narrator] But just
as soon as Hasbro

37:07.352 --> 37:09.524
sinks a fortune into Super Joe,

37:09.624 --> 37:13.532
a new and unexpected
competitor arrives,

37:13.632 --> 37:16.938
action figures from a
galaxy far, far away.

37:18.608 --> 37:23.417
- So enter a new, exciting
boys action property,

37:23.484 --> 37:27.960
"Star Wars," and they do what
will become the new standard

37:27.960 --> 37:29.531
in action figure scale,

37:29.630 --> 37:31.568
three and three
quarter inch figures.

37:32.803 --> 37:35.543
- There was a major seismic
shift in the toy world

37:35.609 --> 37:39.952
when the smaller "Star Wars"
action figures came out.

37:39.952 --> 37:41.286
It was all in space,

37:41.386 --> 37:44.861
and G.I. Joe just didn't
fit that narrative.

37:44.961 --> 37:46.865
- [Kirk] Super Joe lasts
for about two years,

37:46.965 --> 37:51.039
and then by 1978, was
off the marketplace.

37:52.510 --> 37:55.984
- [Narrator] A year later,
Merrill Hassenfeld dies suddenly

37:55.984 --> 37:57.418
from a heart attack.

37:58.522 --> 37:59.657
- When Merrill passes away,

37:59.790 --> 38:01.995
you got a sense that the company

38:01.995 --> 38:05.501
had lost its visionary,

38:05.569 --> 38:08.942
but that vision was
replaced by his son, Steven.

38:09.042 --> 38:11.815
- [Narrator] 38-year-old
Stephen Hassenfeld

38:11.848 --> 38:15.923
is given the daunting task of
turning the business around.

38:15.956 --> 38:21.901
One of his first goals is to
try to re-introduce G.I. Joe.

38:22.402 --> 38:26.778
- The time to bring
G.I. Joe back is now.

38:33.558 --> 38:34.459
- Let's do this.

38:35.596 --> 38:37.967
(rock music)

38:40.706 --> 38:41.908
- [Yohuru] The
ideological conflict

38:42.008 --> 38:44.212
between the United
States and Soviet Union

38:44.446 --> 38:48.689
is essential to G.I. Joe's
reimagination in the 1980s.

38:48.722 --> 38:52.095
- [Narrator] Inspired by the
surge in American patriotism

38:52.128 --> 38:56.103
and the popularity of the
four-inch "Star Wars" figures,

38:56.336 --> 39:00.646
Hasbro reintroduces G.I.
Joe but in the smaller size.

39:02.850 --> 39:06.324
The relaunch is a
runaway success.

39:06.456 --> 39:09.496
Toys, animated
series, video games,

39:09.597 --> 39:12.637
and even G.I. Joe
movies power Hasbro

39:12.736 --> 39:15.576
into a multi-billion
dollar global franchise

39:15.742 --> 39:18.047
that thrives to this day.

39:18.047 --> 39:20.485
- G.I. Joe catapulted Hasbro

39:20.586 --> 39:22.756
to levels that we've
never achieved before.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.635
- [Narrator] Today,
Hasbro boasts sales

39:28.802 --> 39:31.642
of nearly $5.5 billion.

39:32.108 --> 39:33.779
Mattel isn't far behind,

39:33.878 --> 39:36.618
with just under 5
billion in revenue.

39:38.053 --> 39:41.260
- The rivalry between
Hasbro and Mattel

39:41.393 --> 39:42.764
has always been neck and neck.

39:42.896 --> 39:44.934
I think that
continues to this day.

39:45.034 --> 39:47.305
- [Narrator] Sales of
Ruth's revolutionary doll

39:47.472 --> 39:48.875
are stronger than ever,

39:48.942 --> 39:53.585
with revenue of more than
$1 billion in 2019 alone.

39:53.652 --> 39:56.958
- I wish the world knew
more about Ruth Handler.

39:57.025 --> 39:59.797
There's a lot to be learned
from how she succeeded,

39:59.897 --> 40:02.469
how she persevered
through obstacles that

40:02.536 --> 40:05.041
would have stopped almost
any other human being.

40:05.041 --> 40:06.778
She is an American story.

40:08.047 --> 40:10.185
- [Narrator] Both companies
launch more big hits

40:10.185 --> 40:12.524
after Barbie and G.I. Joe.

40:12.656 --> 40:14.994
Mattel creates Masters
of the Universe

40:14.994 --> 40:17.065
and invents Hot Wheels,

40:18.668 --> 40:21.675
rolling along is one of the
highest selling toys ever,

40:21.808 --> 40:24.948
grossing almost $1
billion globally.

40:24.948 --> 40:26.852
Hasbro adds more hits,

40:26.951 --> 40:29.991
including the wildly
successful Transformers

40:29.991 --> 40:31.226
and Super Soakers.

40:32.462 --> 40:35.903
Today, around the world,
someone buys a toy

40:36.003 --> 40:39.710
from Hasbro or Mattel
nearly every second.

40:40.812 --> 40:42.148
- [Christopher]
Merrill Hassenfeld

40:42.148 --> 40:43.719
and Ruth and Elliot Handler

40:43.818 --> 40:46.825
were groundbreaking
entrepreneurs.

40:46.958 --> 40:50.164
They have impacted
generations of kids.

40:50.164 --> 40:51.968
- [Azhelle] Ruth Handler created

40:52.101 --> 40:55.509
an entire category
of play for kids,

40:55.609 --> 40:58.214
and G.I. Joe did the
same thing for boys

40:58.214 --> 41:00.318
that Barbie did for girls.

41:00.318 --> 41:01.989
These toys are a
really integral part

41:02.121 --> 41:04.727
of developing the
way that a kid thinks

41:04.894 --> 41:07.398
and creates and learns.

41:07.633 --> 41:12.643
- [David] The fact that Mattel
and Hasbro are these unique

41:13.978 --> 41:17.620
enormously successful
survivors speaks to really

41:17.753 --> 41:21.628
a century of innovation in toys

41:21.728 --> 41:23.965
because there's hardly
a toy you can think of

41:24.032 --> 41:26.337
that still being produced
that doesn't fall under

41:26.337 --> 41:28.273
either one of those
two umbrellas.
