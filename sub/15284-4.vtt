02:14.808 --> 02:16.542
Hello.

02:16.544 --> 02:18.210
Hello, sir. I just wanted
to remind you

02:18.212 --> 02:20.146
that our normal checkout time
is 11 a.m.

02:20.148 --> 02:22.282
But if you'd like
a later checkout time,

02:22.284 --> 02:26.787
I can go ahead and take care
of that for you now.

02:26.789 --> 02:30.691
Sir, would you like
a later checkout time?

02:30.693 --> 02:32.526
Sir?

02:32.528 --> 02:33.861
Hello?

02:33.863 --> 02:36.030
Are you there?

02:43.172 --> 02:46.908
Uh! Uh! Ohh...

02:46.910 --> 02:48.376
No. No.

03:16.937 --> 03:17.967
Hello?

03:17.968 --> 03:18.934
What's wrong?
Nothing.

03:19.357 --> 03:20.991
Well, it's not Sunday.
We talk on Sunday.

03:21.441 --> 03:24.309
I know. I, um, I just
thought I'd call.

03:25.311 --> 03:27.845
Oh.

03:27.847 --> 03:29.195
You scared me.

03:29.197 --> 03:30.196
Sorry.

03:30.198 --> 03:31.698
I thought it was an emergency.

03:31.700 --> 03:33.366
No, it's not
an emergency.

03:33.368 --> 03:34.801
Yeah? Are you sure?

03:34.803 --> 03:36.269
How are your headaches?

03:36.271 --> 03:38.538
Good. I mean--
I mean they're gone.

03:38.540 --> 03:41.341
Yeah? Are you taking
your riboflavin and the magnesium?

03:41.343 --> 03:44.678
In equal doses and a sporadic shot
of B2 like you said.

03:44.680 --> 03:47.548
And sleep? Are you letting
your gray matter rest?

03:47.550 --> 03:50.818
I'm--I'm working on it.

03:50.820 --> 03:52.720
What's so funny?

03:52.722 --> 03:54.755
What? I didn't laugh.

03:54.757 --> 03:57.391
Something's amusing you.
I can hear it.

03:57.393 --> 04:00.194
You can hear
my body language?

04:00.196 --> 04:02.597
I'm a very good listener.

04:02.599 --> 04:03.998
Um...

04:08.605 --> 04:10.305
I guess I just--
I think it's funny

04:10.307 --> 04:12.741
how we've been doing this
for 6 months and we've never met.

04:12.743 --> 04:15.044
You know, like one Google
search of me and you'll

04:15.069 --> 04:16.312
find my FBI file photo,

04:16.313 --> 04:19.380
but I have absolutely
no idea what you look like.

04:19.382 --> 04:20.887
I've shaved, by the way,
since then.

04:20.889 --> 04:22.689
I used to be sort of
fascinated with the yeti

04:22.691 --> 04:24.090
and I thought
that maybe if I--

04:24.092 --> 04:26.092
I don't know what you
look like either.

04:28.763 --> 04:29.930
Really?

04:29.932 --> 04:31.265
No.

04:31.267 --> 04:33.567
The only intimate part of you
I've seen is your brain

04:33.569 --> 04:36.237
when I studied the MRI
you sent me.

04:36.239 --> 04:37.505
That's when I said,

04:37.507 --> 04:40.675
this is a guy
I need to get to know.

04:42.578 --> 04:46.648
Thanks. That's really nice
of you to say.

04:47.751 --> 04:49.651
What happened?

04:49.653 --> 04:52.320
Something just happened.

04:52.322 --> 04:55.423
Sorry. It's work.
I actually have to go.

04:55.425 --> 04:58.192
Ok. Well, uh,
we'll talk Sunday.

04:58.194 --> 04:59.761
- Be safe.
- Ok.

04:59.763 --> 05:00.929
Wait. Are you being safe?

05:00.931 --> 05:04.433
Yes. Yes, I'm being safe.

05:05.603 --> 05:08.404
Do you--do you think
he knows about us?

05:08.406 --> 05:12.743
No. As far as I can tell
he doesn't.

05:12.745 --> 05:14.945
And we need to keep it
that way.

05:23.655 --> 05:26.624
Well, my friends, you are
heading to New Mexico.

05:26.626 --> 05:28.225
But pack your thermals,

05:28.227 --> 05:30.427
'cause this case
will make you go "brr."

05:30.429 --> 05:32.629
Our unsub du jour
is taking right legs.

05:32.631 --> 05:35.366
The most recent victim,
Tony Anders.

05:35.368 --> 05:36.967
He was dumped
at a local motel.

05:36.969 --> 05:39.502
He's in surgery now.
Looks like he's gonna pull through.

05:39.504 --> 05:41.905
The first victim, not so lucky.
Richard Hubbell.

05:41.907 --> 05:44.441
He died during
the leg absconding process,

05:44.443 --> 05:47.910
and his body was dumped just over
the border in Juarez, Mexico.

05:47.912 --> 05:50.279
Juarez is on the front lines
of the cartels.

05:50.281 --> 05:52.248
Any drug connections
between the victims?

05:52.250 --> 05:53.883
They both just said no.

05:53.885 --> 05:55.551
Tony Anders had
I.V. bruising

05:55.553 --> 05:57.253
and surgical sutures
on his stump.

05:57.255 --> 05:59.756
So the unsub operated
on both victims.

05:59.758 --> 06:01.524
We're looking at a doctor.

06:01.526 --> 06:02.859
That's a first.

06:02.861 --> 06:04.828
Were the victims
patients anywhere?

06:04.830 --> 06:06.663
No. They were
the vision of health.

06:06.665 --> 06:08.966
Tony had hypodermic
needle marks on his neck.

06:08.968 --> 06:10.534
The unsub could have
drugged him

06:10.536 --> 06:12.569
and brought him into
the hospital for surgery.

06:12.571 --> 06:14.371
Unlikely he could hide
in a hospital.

06:14.373 --> 06:17.675
Even the most experienced surgeon
can't operate without supervision.

06:17.677 --> 06:20.211
The goal of amputation
is to remove dead tissue

06:20.213 --> 06:21.879
to preserve an otherwise
healthy limb.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.714
Any first-year medical
student will tell you that.

06:23.716 --> 06:26.784
But this unsub stitched
the skin flap so tightly

06:26.786 --> 06:29.253
over Tony's stump that it didn't
allow for proper blood flow

06:29.255 --> 06:30.754
and led to gangrene.

06:30.756 --> 06:32.256
He's not a surgeon.

06:32.258 --> 06:33.257
What is he?

06:33.259 --> 06:35.560
A butcher.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.044
What happened?

06:52.046 --> 06:54.113
Shh.

06:54.115 --> 06:56.116
Everything's fine.

06:56.118 --> 06:57.550
Was there...

06:57.552 --> 06:59.920
was there an accident?

06:59.922 --> 07:02.755
It's fine.
Everything's fine.

07:02.757 --> 07:04.657
We just need to operate.

07:04.659 --> 07:06.192
Operate?

07:06.194 --> 07:09.195
No, it's ok. It's ok.
You're in good hands.

07:09.197 --> 07:11.564
Did someone call my wife?
She should know.

07:11.566 --> 07:13.432
I will take care of it.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.768
I should really call her,
because she'll be worried.

07:15.770 --> 07:18.571
I told you,
we'll take care of it.

07:18.573 --> 07:21.407
I, uh, have coverage.

07:21.409 --> 07:26.078
My HMO hospital
is St. Mary's, I think.

07:26.080 --> 07:29.915
Is this--am I
at St. Mary's?

07:29.917 --> 07:32.885
Not quite.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.521
Hey, what are you doing?

07:35.523 --> 07:37.223
Hey!

07:37.225 --> 07:39.559
Hey!

Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle wrote,

08:19.200 --> 08:22.797
"When a doctor does go wrong,
he is the first of criminals.

08:22.897 --> 08:25.965
He has the nerve
and he has the knowledge."

08:25.967 --> 08:28.333
So, this unsub's got
a thing for right legs

08:28.358 --> 08:29.736
and he's moving fast.

08:29.737 --> 08:31.871
Two victims in a week.
What's the compulsion?

08:31.873 --> 08:33.566
You know, the fact that one of
the victims was left

08:33.591 --> 08:34.938
in a motel room
makes me think it's not

08:34.938 --> 08:36.610
a compulsion at all.
Maybe it's black market.

08:36.943 --> 08:38.611
What's the going rate
for a leg these days?

08:38.613 --> 08:39.812
Mm, pretty good.

08:39.813 --> 08:41.246
In 2002,
tendons were shipped

08:41.249 --> 08:42.715
from South Africa
to the U.S.

08:42.717 --> 08:45.017
And sold through private
medical and biotech companies.

08:45.019 --> 08:46.652
The body parts trade coexists

08:46.654 --> 08:48.187
with the drug trade
in border towns.

08:48.189 --> 08:49.622
Let's say it's a chop shop.

08:49.624 --> 08:52.492
That means we're looking for
a small team or network.

08:52.494 --> 08:54.761
One that usually deals
with the dead before the living.

08:54.763 --> 08:56.696
Did Garcia find any overlap
with victimology?

08:56.698 --> 08:58.497
Just that they were both
organ donors.

08:58.499 --> 09:00.699
She cross-referencing with the
United Network for Organ Sharing.

09:00.701 --> 09:02.802
U.N.O.S. deals with
vital organs,

09:02.804 --> 09:04.170
but we're talking limbs.

09:04.172 --> 09:06.272
Yeah, but hospitals around
the country are networked into it.

09:06.274 --> 09:08.040
If the unsub is a medical
professional, he might have

09:08.042 --> 09:10.543
access to it, and by
extension, the victims.

09:10.545 --> 09:13.480
Reid, you and JJ go to Juarez
and look at Richard Hubbell's body.

09:13.482 --> 09:15.615
Morgan and Dave,
go talk to Tony Anders.

09:15.617 --> 09:18.518
And Blake and I will investigate
the black market angle here.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.587
Hey.

09:20.589 --> 09:22.155
Detective Gonzalez.

09:22.157 --> 09:23.390
I'm glad you guys
could make it.

09:23.392 --> 09:24.691
I hate the weird ones.

09:24.693 --> 09:26.259
I'm Agent Hotchner.
This is Agent Blake.

09:26.261 --> 09:27.494
Thanks for inviting us.

09:27.496 --> 09:28.628
Absolutely. Come on in.

09:28.630 --> 09:30.063
I've got the board
set up for you in here.

09:30.065 --> 09:31.097
Thank you.
Thank you.

09:32.100 --> 09:33.333
Go ahead, Garcia.
You're on speaker.

09:33.335 --> 09:35.468
Ok, so I quadruple-checked
with U.N.O.S

09:35.470 --> 09:37.537
and there's no way
the unsub is using them,

09:37.539 --> 09:39.538
because like me, they
quadruple-check everything

09:39.540 --> 09:41.373
and their redundancies
have redundancies,

09:41.375 --> 09:42.974
and so there's no chance
there could be any hanky-panky.

09:42.976 --> 09:45.777
He could still be using
medical records to find them, though.

09:45.779 --> 09:47.345
All right, thanks, Garcia.

09:47.347 --> 09:48.546
Welcome, welcome.

09:48.548 --> 09:49.847
Were you able to contact
the specialist we asked about?

09:49.849 --> 09:51.749
The doctor who sold
on the black market?

09:51.751 --> 09:54.718
Yeah. The prison said no way
they would release him.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.788
We'll just have to go
to him, then.

10:00.258 --> 10:02.058
I remember...

10:02.060 --> 10:06.998
walking out of
organic chemistry, and...

10:07.000 --> 10:08.800
then...

10:10.303 --> 10:12.336
nothing.

10:12.338 --> 10:13.504
What about
when you woke up?

10:13.506 --> 10:15.439
There was a...

10:15.441 --> 10:18.142
beeping, like that,

10:18.144 --> 10:20.978
and there was a mask...

10:20.980 --> 10:23.881
over my face, I think.

10:23.883 --> 10:27.051
I can't remember, man.
It's all a blur.

10:29.054 --> 10:33.658
Tony, do me a favor.

10:33.660 --> 10:36.760
Close your eyes.

10:36.762 --> 10:38.895
Just humor me, ok?

10:44.001 --> 10:46.302
All right.

10:46.304 --> 10:48.471
Think back to that room.

10:48.473 --> 10:50.205
That bed.

10:50.207 --> 10:51.806
That beeping.

10:51.808 --> 10:56.011
It probably smelled
a lot like this room.

10:56.013 --> 10:58.246
You were out.

10:58.248 --> 11:00.348
You should have
stayed out.

11:00.350 --> 11:02.450
But you didn't.

11:03.619 --> 11:05.386
Now...

11:05.388 --> 11:07.455
Wake up!

11:15.063 --> 11:19.667
Tony, something just
came to you. What was it?

11:19.669 --> 11:21.235
I can't explain it.

11:21.237 --> 11:23.770
Don't think it,
just say it.

11:27.007 --> 11:29.375
It was a door.

11:31.745 --> 11:34.380
A garage door.

11:34.382 --> 11:36.816
I was in somebody's
garage.

11:47.395 --> 11:52.499
I need to, uh,
ask you some questions.

11:52.501 --> 11:56.136
If you want this to go well,

11:56.138 --> 11:59.172
I suggest you answer
honestly.

12:00.642 --> 12:04.611
Have you eaten anything
in the past 12 hours?

12:04.613 --> 12:06.413
Uh, yeah.

12:06.415 --> 12:09.716
Have you consumed alcohol?

12:09.718 --> 12:10.950
No. Just wait a--

12:10.952 --> 12:12.318
You had surgery before?

12:12.320 --> 12:13.720
Yes. Please, just tell me--

12:13.722 --> 12:14.754
Any complications?

12:14.756 --> 12:17.023
No, no. It was Lasik.

12:17.025 --> 12:21.394
Anything you'd like to ask
before we begin?

12:21.396 --> 12:23.163
Why are you doing this
to me?

12:23.165 --> 12:29.369
Now, I'm going to count
backwards from 10.

12:29.371 --> 12:30.570
10...

12:30.572 --> 12:31.571
Please--please--

12:31.573 --> 12:33.306
9...

12:33.308 --> 12:34.708
8...

12:34.710 --> 12:37.444
7...

12:37.446 --> 12:39.746
6...

12:39.748 --> 12:41.882
5...

12:41.884 --> 12:45.152
4...

12:46.522 --> 12:48.722
Good afternoon.
I'm Alex Blake with the FBI.

12:48.724 --> 12:51.024
I'm here to see if you
can cooperate on this--

12:51.026 --> 12:52.559
Let me see the file.

13:01.601 --> 13:04.369
Right now it's just
a missing limb case.

13:04.371 --> 13:07.141
Your expertise can tell us
if he's selling legs

13:07.166 --> 13:08.908
on the black market.

13:08.909 --> 13:13.278
We felt that to find the best,
we should go to the best.

13:17.684 --> 13:20.452
Can you help us, Mr. Smith?

13:25.491 --> 13:28.593
First of all,
it's Dr. Smith,

13:28.595 --> 13:30.462
not Mr. Smith.

13:30.464 --> 13:32.164
Second,

13:32.166 --> 13:34.767
the only way I'll give you
my expert opinion

13:34.769 --> 13:38.604
is if we cut a deal,
right now.

13:45.814 --> 13:49.851
I could do that...

13:51.386 --> 13:55.090
Or I could stop
wasting my time with you.

13:55.092 --> 13:56.925
This guy's not doing it
for the money.

13:56.927 --> 13:58.727
If you knew that for sure
you wouldn't be here.

13:58.729 --> 14:01.696
What I do know is what kind
of medicine you practiced.

14:01.698 --> 14:04.733
What do the eyes go for
in Beijing, a grand?

14:04.735 --> 14:07.903
The skin you sent to Moscow,
that netted you what, 15?

14:07.905 --> 14:09.812
So when you looked
at the last picture,

14:09.837 --> 14:11.707
I know what you saw.

14:11.708 --> 14:14.075
You saw an amateur
who could make a lot more money

14:14.077 --> 14:16.278
if he took more
than the right leg.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.780
After all, you did.

14:18.782 --> 14:20.449
Listen, Agent.

14:20.451 --> 14:22.250
Actually, it's doctor.

14:22.252 --> 14:24.419
Unlike you,
I still have my degree.

14:24.421 --> 14:27.722
But you have
a good day, Mr. Smith.

14:33.095 --> 14:35.463
It could be dumping
the body down here

14:35.465 --> 14:37.300
was a forensic countermeasure.

14:37.302 --> 14:39.836
Probably, but it's the deviation
in M.O. that stumps me.

14:39.838 --> 14:44.841
Pun intended. Two different victims,
two different amputations.

14:44.843 --> 14:46.743
All right, so what
do you see, doctor?

14:46.745 --> 14:48.011
This amputation
was transtibial,

14:48.013 --> 14:50.680
but the survivor
was transfemoral.

14:50.682 --> 14:53.483
So his leg was cut
below the knee,

14:53.485 --> 14:54.617
and Tony's was cut above.

14:54.619 --> 14:56.186
The cutting here
was pristine,

14:56.188 --> 14:58.521
nerve and vascular dissection was careful,
well-ligated.

14:58.523 --> 15:01.991
I mean, this unsub definitely
 knew what he was doing medically.

15:01.993 --> 15:03.893
I thought you said
the unsub wasn't a doctor.

15:03.895 --> 15:05.227
I said he wasn't a surgeon,

15:05.229 --> 15:06.730
but his knowledge
of anatomy and procedure

15:06.732 --> 15:08.398
shows definite medical
training.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.700
Hey, Spence.

15:09.702 --> 15:12.669
The hole in the bone--
it's perfectly circular.

15:12.671 --> 15:16.440
The medical examiner said
that was most likely caused by animals.

15:16.442 --> 15:17.875
It's bored in.
It's like he drilled it.

15:17.877 --> 15:20.812
Not with any surgical tool
that I'm familiar with.

15:20.814 --> 15:24.950
Well, maybe this is what he's
been trying to hide from us.

15:51.744 --> 15:54.044
Based on the way
this unsub treats his victims,

15:54.046 --> 15:55.779
we need to look
at this case a different way.

15:55.781 --> 15:58.482
We know it's not for profit
and we know he's not a killer.

15:58.484 --> 15:59.749
So what is he?

15:59.751 --> 16:01.878
A scientist, or at least he sees
himself that way.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.710
Which means he sees his
victims as test subjects.

16:03.712 --> 16:05.378
And if we're right,
we're not going to see

16:05.380 --> 16:07.447
the usual signature
or consistent victimology.

16:07.449 --> 16:09.014
There's no compulsion,
sexual or otherwise.

16:09.016 --> 16:11.316
So there won't be
a trigger or a stressor either.

16:11.318 --> 16:13.251
That doesn't leave
a lot to profile.

16:13.253 --> 16:15.286
Not true. We do have
his medical technique.

16:15.288 --> 16:16.587
And based on the remnants
of Hubbell's surgery,

16:16.589 --> 16:17.887
I think the unsub's
experimenting.

16:17.889 --> 16:19.688
With what?
A new way to amputate?

16:19.690 --> 16:21.790
The hole in his knee
makes us think

16:21.792 --> 16:23.291
it's more radical
than that.

16:23.293 --> 16:25.460
Amputating the leg
is not the unsub's goal.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.128
Reattaching it is.

16:27.130 --> 16:29.730
You think this unsub's
performing transplants?

16:29.732 --> 16:31.999
It explains why he only
wanted Tony Anders' leg.

16:32.001 --> 16:33.467
I think
that's the experiment.

16:33.469 --> 16:35.302
He wants to see
if he can put a foreign leg

16:35.304 --> 16:36.970
on someone else's body.

16:44.679 --> 16:46.746
Can you--

16:51.019 --> 16:52.286
can you help--

16:52.288 --> 16:53.754
can you--can you
help--

16:53.756 --> 16:57.424
Ma'am, the doctor can't
diagnose you over the phone.

16:57.426 --> 16:58.942
Ma'am, I don't know
what you want me to do.

16:58.967 --> 16:59.694
You need to come in.

16:59.695 --> 17:01.762
The doctor can't
diagnose you over the phone.

17:01.764 --> 17:04.631
Please...
I need someone...

17:04.633 --> 17:07.567
No, ma'am, I'm sorry.
You need to come in.

17:07.569 --> 17:10.670
Somebody help me!

17:10.672 --> 17:13.071
Hey, sir, what's your problem?

17:13.074 --> 17:15.108
It's my leg.

17:15.109 --> 17:16.609
Ok, does it hurt?

17:16.612 --> 17:17.544
No, it's been cut.

17:17.546 --> 17:19.012
Ok. Can you get me
some scissors?

17:19.013 --> 17:22.016
Ok, what happened?
Did you cut it?

17:23.385 --> 17:24.719
No.

17:25.988 --> 17:28.190
It's not...

17:28.192 --> 17:31.726
My...leg.

17:59.613 --> 18:01.047
Did the camera
pick up anything?

18:01.049 --> 18:02.883
He dropped him off
a block away.

18:02.885 --> 18:04.451
This poor guy limped
into the hospital

18:04.453 --> 18:05.986
on a leg
that wasn't his.

18:05.988 --> 18:06.921
What's the note say?

18:06.923 --> 18:08.389
The unsub helpfully
suggests

18:08.391 --> 18:10.525
a high dose of cyclosporine
for his patient,

18:10.527 --> 18:11.692
Carl Timmons.

18:11.694 --> 18:13.428
It wouldn't have made
any difference.

18:13.430 --> 18:14.963
I mean, gangrene and sepsis
had already set in.

18:14.965 --> 18:16.664
There's nothing the hospital
could have done.

18:16.666 --> 18:18.432
Reid, you getting
a migraine?

18:18.434 --> 18:22.570
No. No, I haven't had one of those
for months, ever since, um...

18:22.572 --> 18:24.772
This doesn't make
any sense, Morgan.

18:24.774 --> 18:26.708
Well, does it ever,
Reid?

18:26.710 --> 18:29.244
This unsub is supposed to have
a background in science, right?

18:29.246 --> 18:31.413
Why is his science so bad?

18:31.415 --> 18:33.715
He amputated Carl's leg,
sewed it up,

18:33.717 --> 18:36.151
and then reopened
the sutures for transplant?

18:36.153 --> 18:38.720
You find anything
on the knee?

18:38.722 --> 18:41.022
He left his handiwork in
this time.

18:42.224 --> 18:43.691
It's a surgical implant.

18:43.693 --> 18:44.893
Maybe that's what
he was trying to perfect,

18:44.895 --> 18:46.928
transplanting the leg
onto an amputee.

18:46.930 --> 18:47.935
Medically impossible.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.103
You can't graft a leg
onto someone else's stump.

18:50.567 --> 18:52.501
Well, you and I know that,
and this guy must know that,

18:52.503 --> 18:54.703
but maybe he just won't stop
until he succeeds.

18:54.705 --> 18:57.506
A doctor that can't
admit he's wrong?

18:57.508 --> 18:59.308
It's time to give
the profile.

18:59.310 --> 19:04.246
The unsub we're looking for
is a doctor with a severe God complex.

19:04.248 --> 19:05.747
His narcissism
makes him believe

19:05.749 --> 19:08.618
that he can defy human
biology and anatomy.

19:08.620 --> 19:11.321
His narcissism has likely
caused problems in his career.

19:11.323 --> 19:13.990
So look for doctors
who've lost their licenses

19:13.992 --> 19:16.126
or medical students
who've had ethical violations.

19:16.128 --> 19:17.961
With a psychopath
like this,

19:17.963 --> 19:20.664
shouldn't we also be looking
at released mental patients?

19:20.666 --> 19:22.599
We don't think
he is a psychopath.

19:22.601 --> 19:24.435
Psychopaths rarely have
the training and discipline

19:24.437 --> 19:25.703
for medical school
or residency.

19:25.705 --> 19:28.539
So this unsub won't behave
in an antisocial manner.

19:28.541 --> 19:32.108
He's probably successful,
respectful, outgoing.

19:32.110 --> 19:34.545
We think that he can
maintain healthy relationships,

19:34.547 --> 19:37.514
and his neighbors
probably know him well.

19:37.516 --> 19:39.248
And his background
makes us think he lives

19:39.250 --> 19:40.850
a mid- to upper class
lifestyle.

19:40.852 --> 19:42.685
He may be married
and have kids.

19:42.687 --> 19:45.220
If so, he would be
devoted to both.

19:45.222 --> 19:47.355
So don't look for the weirdo
in the van with no windows.

19:47.357 --> 19:49.023
Look for the pillars
of the community.

19:49.025 --> 19:52.159
Yeah, but if he's so well-known,
how's he hiding these operations

19:52.161 --> 19:53.627
from all these people?

19:53.629 --> 19:55.629
Through a psychological
process called doubling.

19:55.631 --> 19:58.865
He acts one way professionally,
but he acts another way at home.

19:58.867 --> 20:00.300
It's occurred before
in history.

20:00.302 --> 20:03.203
Like the Nazi doctors
in Auschwitz and Dachau.

20:03.205 --> 20:04.938
They could separate
their genocidal actions

20:04.940 --> 20:08.242
from their normal lives
as fathers, healers, and husbands.

20:08.244 --> 20:10.311
And like the doctors
under Hitler's regime,

20:10.313 --> 20:14.081
this unsub's sense of superiority
supersedes the Hippocratic oath.

20:14.083 --> 20:19.420
Yes, well, the trial phase
is almost complete.

20:19.422 --> 20:21.757
I'll, uh, I'll send it to you

20:21.759 --> 20:24.860
once I've compiled it.

20:24.862 --> 20:28.063
Yes. Yes, thank you.

20:33.069 --> 20:34.670
That didn't sound good.

20:34.672 --> 20:39.007
The investors want to see
all my data.

20:39.009 --> 20:40.376
And you're not ready.

20:40.378 --> 20:44.447
I came close last night,
but...

20:44.449 --> 20:46.049
I'm in trouble.

20:46.051 --> 20:48.551
Ok, breathe, honey.

20:48.553 --> 20:51.120
We're gonna
get through this.

20:51.122 --> 20:52.388
If they pull their funding--

20:52.390 --> 20:53.856
- They won't.
- we lose everything.

20:53.858 --> 20:55.691
The equipment in the garage,
the house.

20:55.693 --> 20:56.993
It's not going
to happen.

20:56.995 --> 20:58.327
How do you know that?

20:58.329 --> 21:01.063
Because I know you.

21:01.065 --> 21:03.599
But you have to let
yourself off the hook

21:03.601 --> 21:06.603
if you're gonna
figure this out.

21:06.605 --> 21:09.072
I almost had it,
you know?

21:09.074 --> 21:10.307
That's what's
so frustrating.

21:10.309 --> 21:11.808
If I could just get it
right one time,

21:11.810 --> 21:15.312
you and I can--
we can lead a better life.

21:15.314 --> 21:18.682
Honey,
I have a great life.

21:18.684 --> 21:20.818
Don't worry about me.

21:20.820 --> 21:23.987
Worry about those little
mice out in your lab.

21:23.989 --> 21:26.523
Hmm. Well, I hate
to tell you,

21:26.525 --> 21:29.626
but I've moved up from mice
in the last couple of weeks.

21:29.628 --> 21:31.467
Ok. Whatever critters
you have out there,

21:31.492 --> 21:33.398
I don't want to know.

21:33.399 --> 21:36.467
But if it's a choice
between them or the house,

21:36.469 --> 21:40.104
well, a couple more might have
to give their life up to science.

21:40.106 --> 21:42.273
Oh, I love you
so much.

21:43.275 --> 21:45.276
Mmm.

21:45.278 --> 21:46.944
Stop worrying.

21:48.513 --> 21:49.780
Mm.

21:55.787 --> 21:59.189
Well, these are doctors
and med students in the area,

21:59.191 --> 22:01.658
and there are a lot of
washouts who fit the profile.

22:01.660 --> 22:03.960
What about the prosthetic
attachment from Carl Timmons' leg?

22:03.962 --> 22:05.595
Is there anything
identifiable on it?

22:05.597 --> 22:08.164
Yeah. I just sent you the
chemical breakdown from our lab.

22:08.166 --> 22:09.632
It's mostly a thick polymer

22:09.634 --> 22:11.968
designed to withstand
the constant mobility of the leg.

22:11.970 --> 22:14.137
So the resin
is coated in plastic?

22:14.139 --> 22:16.673
Mm-hmm. It's a combination
of organic and inorganic materials.

22:16.675 --> 22:19.442
That's probably
to stave off rejection.

22:19.444 --> 22:21.577
Garcia, is the resin
biodegradable?

22:21.579 --> 22:24.513
As a matter of fact, yes.
How is it you know everything?

22:24.515 --> 22:27.382
All this time we assumed he's a doctor.
But what if he isn't?

22:27.384 --> 22:29.451
What if he has the training
in cutting and stitching

22:29.453 --> 22:31.186
but never went
to medical school?

22:31.188 --> 22:33.088
Where do you get
training like that?

22:33.090 --> 22:34.556
I see.

22:34.558 --> 22:36.424
So you think this man
is a mortician.

22:36.426 --> 22:38.493
It's one of the theories
we're pursuing.

22:38.495 --> 22:40.028
But we think
this implant

22:40.030 --> 22:41.830
is the key
to his training.

22:41.832 --> 22:43.297
Is this something
your employees would use?

22:43.299 --> 22:46.901
Yes. We use it for reattachment
on our dearly beloved.

22:46.903 --> 22:48.937
Sometimes they come to us
in more than one piece,

22:48.939 --> 22:51.205
and we need to perform
some...reassembly

22:51.207 --> 22:52.807
for an open casket funeral.

22:52.809 --> 22:55.343
The biodegradability
is for what, cremation?

22:55.345 --> 22:56.544
Precisely.

22:56.546 --> 22:57.912
And unlike a surgeon,

22:57.914 --> 23:00.181
a mortician would want
to reattach a limb

23:00.183 --> 23:02.750
at a movable joint
like a knee or an elbow?

23:02.752 --> 23:05.587
It's easier to use dead bone
than muscle or vasculature.

23:06.790 --> 23:08.122
Would you excuse me?

23:08.124 --> 23:10.057
Thank you for your help.

23:10.059 --> 23:11.225
Of course.

23:12.261 --> 23:14.328
So, we know the unsub
got started

23:14.330 --> 23:15.563
in a place like this,

23:15.565 --> 23:17.131
but how's he finding
his victims now?

23:17.133 --> 23:19.867
Well, he's equipped
his garage with medical equipment.

23:19.869 --> 23:22.570
He might not be a doctor, but he
could be posing as one.

23:42.292 --> 23:44.593
Look, I'm sorry,
but I can't remember

23:44.595 --> 23:46.028
anyone like
you're talking about.

23:46.030 --> 23:47.930
Now, just take a second
and think.

23:47.932 --> 23:49.499
Is there any medical
care that you've had

23:49.501 --> 23:51.167
that this guy could have
had access to.

23:51.169 --> 23:53.202
I haven't even been sick
lately.

23:53.204 --> 23:54.270
Did you change
doctors?

23:54.272 --> 23:55.905
What doctor?
I'm in college.

23:55.907 --> 23:57.640
How about student
health services?

23:57.642 --> 23:59.809
Or an outreach
on campus.

23:59.811 --> 24:01.143
A health drive.

24:01.145 --> 24:03.579
Maybe you gave blood.

24:06.316 --> 24:08.618
Wait a second.

24:08.620 --> 24:10.920
Yeah. I give blood
all the time.

24:10.922 --> 24:13.022
When was the last time?

24:13.024 --> 24:15.058
A couple weeks ago.

24:15.060 --> 24:17.894
It was a long line because there
was just one guy in the truck.

24:17.896 --> 24:20.062
What did the guy
look like?

24:20.064 --> 24:21.764
I don't remember.

24:21.766 --> 24:23.566
I was more focused
on the needle going into my arm.

24:23.568 --> 24:27.336
But you gave him your contact info,
your medical history.

24:27.338 --> 24:29.705
Yeah. Absolutely.

24:29.707 --> 24:32.307
That's how he found you.

24:41.484 --> 24:43.385
Hi.
Hi.

24:43.387 --> 24:45.020
You said there was
something wrong with my test?

24:45.022 --> 24:47.656
It's probably nothing. We just
need to take another sample.

24:54.630 --> 24:56.298
Help...

24:56.300 --> 24:58.733
- What is wrong?
- Help me.

25:06.474 --> 25:08.876
Please...please...

25:08.878 --> 25:10.744
help me.

25:12.047 --> 25:14.081
Please.

25:14.083 --> 25:17.084
I can't.

25:35.872 --> 25:37.975
The victim's name
is Maria Rodriguez.

25:37.981 --> 25:39.480
First time he's operated
on a woman.

25:39.482 --> 25:41.615
He transplanted
a left leg this time.

25:41.617 --> 25:43.283
She died from blood loss.

25:43.285 --> 25:44.952
There's no gangrene
on the transplanted leg,

25:44.954 --> 25:46.953
which means
the surgery's fresh.

25:46.955 --> 25:48.421
You think he still has
the other woman?

25:48.423 --> 25:49.889
It justifies his haste
in dumping her here.

25:49.891 --> 25:51.925
Why didn't he go
to the desert or a hospital?

25:51.927 --> 25:55.028
It also means he's
speeding up his surgeries.

25:55.030 --> 25:56.296
Reid, where are you going?

25:56.298 --> 25:57.864
Reid.

25:57.866 --> 26:00.934
Yeah, yeah, I'm still
combing through morticians.

26:00.936 --> 26:02.202
Garcia, I actually
need something else.

26:02.204 --> 26:04.238
Can you tell me where
the nearest pay phone is?

26:04.240 --> 26:05.706
Sorry?

26:05.708 --> 26:08.142
Pay phone.
Like a phone you pay

26:08.144 --> 26:09.910
to make phone calls on.

26:09.912 --> 26:11.846
Oh, my sweet analog Luddite.

26:11.848 --> 26:13.013
That is what your cell is for.

26:13.015 --> 26:14.014
Garcia, please.

26:14.016 --> 26:15.249
Ok.

26:15.251 --> 26:17.585
Someone is being mysterious.

26:17.587 --> 26:19.054
It's gonna take me a second.

26:19.056 --> 26:20.789
Pay phones gave gone the way
of the Dodo birds.

26:20.791 --> 26:22.057
They don't show up
on Google maps.

26:22.059 --> 26:23.425
All right,
try local telecoms.

26:23.427 --> 26:24.927
Yes, I know that.
I'm doing it right now.

26:24.929 --> 26:26.895
And there is one
5 miles away.

26:26.897 --> 26:28.730
I just texted it
to your cell phone,

26:28.732 --> 26:30.265
which you can also use
to call people.

26:30.267 --> 26:31.533
Thanks much.

26:32.868 --> 26:34.903
Alex.

26:34.905 --> 26:36.504
Blake, wait.
Where are you going?

26:36.506 --> 26:38.739
Hotch called. He wants us
back at the station ASAP.

26:38.741 --> 26:41.041
Can you give me a ride
to 5th and Main? It's on the way.

26:41.043 --> 26:43.878
Uh...yeah, sure.
What's at 5th and Main?

26:43.880 --> 26:45.112
I need to talk
to somebody.

26:45.114 --> 26:47.248
Uh...ok, sure.

26:54.657 --> 26:56.157
What...

26:56.159 --> 26:58.593
What happened?

26:58.595 --> 27:01.129
You survived the surgery.

27:01.131 --> 27:03.665
Quite well, in fact.

27:03.667 --> 27:07.268
Surgery? What are you--

27:08.604 --> 27:09.904
oh, my God.

27:09.906 --> 27:11.072
I know.

27:11.074 --> 27:13.508
Congratulations.

27:13.510 --> 27:16.278
Whose--whose leg is that?

27:16.280 --> 27:19.814
Ah. She didn't survive
the transplant.

27:19.816 --> 27:21.516
But you did.

27:21.518 --> 27:22.951
I can't...

27:22.953 --> 27:26.054
I can't move it.

27:26.056 --> 27:27.322
You will, in a few days.

27:27.324 --> 27:30.125
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

27:30.127 --> 27:32.060
Just relax.

27:32.062 --> 27:34.396
Now that I've found
a suitable match,

27:34.398 --> 27:37.800
I'll let you rest a little
before we do the next one.

27:37.802 --> 27:38.801
No.

27:38.803 --> 27:40.069
No, wait.

27:40.071 --> 27:42.873
Please. Please.

27:42.875 --> 27:44.441
Don't take my other leg!

27:44.443 --> 27:45.843
Please!

27:50.615 --> 27:52.249
Do you want me to wait?

27:52.251 --> 27:53.550
Uh, you know,
it might take a while,

27:53.552 --> 27:56.887
so I'll just take a cab back.
Thanks anyway.

27:56.889 --> 27:59.189
Bye.

28:35.258 --> 28:37.392
What's the deal?

28:37.394 --> 28:39.661
Something's not right,
Spencer.

28:39.663 --> 28:41.095
What do you mean?
Why did you come back?

28:41.097 --> 28:43.264
Don't answer a question
with a question.

28:45.834 --> 28:47.802
Look, a while back,
I had some medical issues--

28:47.804 --> 28:50.404
headaches--and there was
a geneticist that I reached out to.

28:50.406 --> 28:51.739
And this has to do
with the case how?

28:51.741 --> 28:53.174
I think that my friend
might be able to help me

28:53.176 --> 28:54.475
see something
that we missed.

28:54.477 --> 28:57.111
You have 4 of the best minds
I know back at the station.

28:57.113 --> 28:58.460
I know, but sometimes
a different perspective

28:58.485 --> 29:00.285
helps me think better, ok?

29:00.349 --> 29:03.083
Why are you being
so ambiguous?

29:03.085 --> 29:05.219
I don't know what you mean?

29:05.221 --> 29:07.688
You're not using words
like him or her.

29:07.690 --> 29:11.859
You're saying things like
"they are," "my friends."

29:11.861 --> 29:13.594
So?

29:13.596 --> 29:15.228
It begs a bigger question.

29:15.230 --> 29:18.064
Why did you ask me
to bring you here?

29:19.201 --> 29:21.334
Can we just talk
about this later, please?

29:21.336 --> 29:22.635
No. Why not Morgan or JJ?

29:22.637 --> 29:24.170
Alex, please--

29:24.172 --> 29:26.339
Just answer the question!

29:28.342 --> 29:32.110
Because I don't want them
to know about her. Ok?

29:35.482 --> 29:37.716
It's nothing bad,
it's just personal.

29:39.720 --> 29:41.087
Ok.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.057
I'm here. I'm here.

29:45.059 --> 29:46.759
Spencer, why are you
calling me right now?

29:46.761 --> 29:49.329
I know. I know.
It's important.

29:51.599 --> 29:53.467
Baby girl,
what'd you find?

29:53.469 --> 29:54.835
Sorry, my love.
There's no overlap

29:54.837 --> 29:56.803
between morticians
and bloodmobile techs.

29:56.805 --> 29:58.105
Most of them are volunteers.

29:58.107 --> 30:00.307
If this guy's running
his own rig,

30:00.309 --> 30:02.042
he's not gonna show up.

30:05.046 --> 30:06.847
What are we missing?

30:06.849 --> 30:08.715
At first I just thought he was
taking whoever was available.

30:08.717 --> 30:10.216
Except he's operating
a bloodmobile.

30:10.218 --> 30:11.885
Yes, thank you, exactly.

30:11.887 --> 30:13.820
That's not an accident.
He's obviously using it as a cover

30:13.822 --> 30:15.455
to screen for something,
and that's why I'm calling you.

30:15.457 --> 30:18.057
I'm hoping that you can help me
figure out what he's screening for.

30:19.193 --> 30:22.796
Maybe the unsub
is an amputee.

30:22.798 --> 30:25.265
So he's working on a solution
for his own condition.

30:25.267 --> 30:28.135
The rest of the profile applies.
He's got a God complex.

30:28.137 --> 30:30.838
He thinks he's perfect.
Infallible, even.

30:30.840 --> 30:33.541
Hard to maintain that
if you're missing a leg.

30:33.543 --> 30:34.909
It's almost ironic.

30:34.911 --> 30:37.487
Most amputees have
a healthier psychology

30:37.512 --> 30:39.481
than this unsub.

30:39.482 --> 30:43.118
You know, what you're describing
reminds me of Josef Mengele.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.519
Yeah, we worked doubling
into the profile.

30:44.521 --> 30:46.721
No, I mean Mengele's
experiments on twins.

30:46.723 --> 30:49.824
He operated on thousands
of them. Why?

30:49.826 --> 30:51.259
I don't know, actually.

30:51.261 --> 30:53.361
He thought he could
repopulate Germany faster

30:53.363 --> 30:55.101
if he could figure out a way
to get women to conceive

30:55.126 --> 30:56.899
with multiple embryos.

30:56.900 --> 30:59.801
So you think this guy's
pursuing his own impossible cause.

30:59.803 --> 31:02.938
What if he's not trying to
fix himself, but somebody else?

31:02.940 --> 31:05.440
That would fit his God complex.

31:05.442 --> 31:06.441
Like who?

31:06.443 --> 31:08.376
A spouse or a child, maybe.

31:08.378 --> 31:12.514
Someone he can ultimately
heal by sacrificing these victims.

31:23.793 --> 31:24.793
Mm.

31:24.795 --> 31:25.794
Ah.

31:26.797 --> 31:27.763
Shh. Shh.

31:27.765 --> 31:29.832
What is it?
Everything ok?

31:29.834 --> 31:32.101
I need you
to see something.

31:33.270 --> 31:36.038
Before he transplants,
he turns them into amputees.

31:36.040 --> 31:37.373
That's part of his experiment.

31:37.375 --> 31:39.108
What if there's a condition
the victim shares,

31:39.110 --> 31:40.843
something involving
amputation?

31:40.845 --> 31:43.579
It doesn't make sense.
He couldn't screen for that genetically.

31:43.581 --> 31:46.281
Unless it's congenital, something
that caused the amputation in utero?

31:46.283 --> 31:49.118
The way Thalidomide caused
birth defects in pregnant moms.

31:49.120 --> 31:50.286
Exactly. So I guess
the question is,

31:50.288 --> 31:51.788
what else causes
birth defects?

31:51.790 --> 31:54.791
That's a long list.
Chromosomal, fetal alcohol syndrome.

31:54.793 --> 31:57.761
What if we focused on what
causes limb deformities specifically?

31:57.763 --> 32:00.064
Uh, rubella, herpes,
among others.

32:00.066 --> 32:01.862
Herpes is most common,
but it isn't screened for

32:01.887 --> 32:03.134
when you donate blood.

32:03.135 --> 32:04.668
But there are a lot of
different strains of herpes.

32:04.670 --> 32:06.604
You know, chickenpox,
for instance.

32:06.606 --> 32:08.239
If a mother
isn't inoculated

32:08.241 --> 32:11.276
and she passes the virus
in utero, can't that cause birth defects?

32:11.278 --> 32:13.979
Yeah. Among other things,

32:13.981 --> 32:16.115
it can lead
to limb hypoplasia.

32:16.117 --> 32:18.784
The binding of which would
appear similar to amputation.

32:18.786 --> 32:20.252
But if it's a condition
in the mother,

32:20.254 --> 32:22.288
why operate on men
the first 3 times?

32:22.290 --> 32:24.423
Those were trial runs.

32:24.425 --> 32:26.388
Now that he's operating
on women, he thinks

32:26.413 --> 32:27.977
he's found an answer.

32:32.899 --> 32:34.934
Move.

32:37.638 --> 32:39.205
Move!

32:56.057 --> 32:57.357
You ready?

32:57.359 --> 32:58.825
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

33:06.635 --> 33:09.270
Ok.

33:09.272 --> 33:11.505
Ok.

34:03.493 --> 34:05.460
Honey, are you sure
about this?

34:05.462 --> 34:10.231
I promise. This is everything
we've been working towards.

34:15.536 --> 34:18.172
I'm ready for you,
you son of a bitch!

34:32.873 --> 34:34.942
Look.

34:34.944 --> 34:36.744
There she is.

34:38.080 --> 34:40.081
There who is?

34:40.083 --> 34:41.215
John--

34:41.217 --> 34:43.050
No!

34:43.052 --> 34:44.385
No!
There who is?

34:44.387 --> 34:45.987
What are you operating on
out here?

34:45.989 --> 34:46.838
I had a breakthrough.

34:46.862 --> 34:49.097
One of my subjects
survived, but she's gone!

34:49.549 --> 34:51.393
- She's gone.
- People?

34:53.396 --> 34:55.429
You've been doing this
to people?!

34:55.431 --> 34:57.431
Aah! John!

34:57.433 --> 34:58.799
Aah! John! John!

34:58.801 --> 35:01.335
Linda! Linda!

35:01.337 --> 35:02.903
Linda!
No! Help!

35:02.905 --> 35:05.906
What's happening?

35:07.742 --> 35:09.410
Garcia, did you get
the mortician's records?

35:09.412 --> 35:10.411
Ready and waiting.

35:10.413 --> 35:11.778
Isolate the married ones.

35:11.780 --> 35:13.380
We're looking for limb
deformities in the wife

35:13.382 --> 35:14.982
caused by chickenpox.

35:14.984 --> 35:17.050
That's about as narrow
as it gets.

35:21.523 --> 35:23.734
Eureka! Linda Nelson,
married to John Nelson.

35:23.736 --> 35:25.353
Quit his job at the funeral
home two months ago.

35:25.378 --> 35:26.829
Sending address now.

35:27.196 --> 35:29.597
Take Rossi and JJ.
Bring him in for questioning.

35:29.599 --> 35:31.299
Thanks.

35:33.435 --> 35:34.702
Aah!

35:34.704 --> 35:36.171
Put down the scalpel.

35:36.173 --> 35:37.405
You come any closer
and I take out her eye.

35:37.407 --> 35:38.473
John! John!

35:38.475 --> 35:40.541
Ok. Ok. You win.

35:40.543 --> 35:42.043
You win.

35:42.045 --> 35:43.078
You can go.

35:43.080 --> 35:44.546
Go ahead.

35:44.548 --> 35:47.582
Ok? You can walk
right out of here.

35:47.584 --> 35:49.050
But please, just--
don't hurt her.

35:49.052 --> 35:50.385
Go ahead.

35:50.387 --> 35:52.788
You can just
walk right out, ok?

35:52.790 --> 35:53.755
There's the door.

35:53.757 --> 35:55.724
See?

35:55.726 --> 35:57.125
Aah!

35:57.127 --> 35:59.662
John! John, stop it!

35:59.664 --> 36:01.230
John, don't do this.

36:01.232 --> 36:02.298
Stop this!

36:02.300 --> 36:03.466
This is my success,
honey.

36:03.468 --> 36:05.534
She showed me what
I was doing wrong.

36:05.536 --> 36:08.971
I don't care!
She's a human being.

36:08.973 --> 36:10.905
FBI!

36:13.275 --> 36:14.976
John Nelson,

36:14.978 --> 36:16.278
put the needle down.

36:16.280 --> 36:18.880
I have potassium
chloride in this.

36:18.882 --> 36:21.549
If you don't get out of here right now,
this is a dead woman.

36:21.551 --> 36:23.118
John, don't do this!

36:23.120 --> 36:24.820
Doctor, the experiment
is over.

36:24.822 --> 36:27.122
If you kill her,
no one will see your work.

36:27.124 --> 36:29.258
My work. My work.

36:29.260 --> 36:30.893
You don't understand.

36:30.895 --> 36:32.561
I've perfected this.

36:32.563 --> 36:34.029
This is my last test.

36:34.031 --> 36:35.364
Drop it now!

36:35.366 --> 36:37.166
Then I can fix you.

36:38.135 --> 36:41.371
I never wanted
to be fixed.

36:47.144 --> 36:48.811
Linda. Linda.

36:48.813 --> 36:50.780
You are the one
that he loves.

36:50.782 --> 36:53.382
You're the only one
that can convince him

36:53.384 --> 36:54.717
what he's doing is wrong.

36:59.189 --> 37:00.690
John.

37:00.692 --> 37:02.191
John, look at me.

37:02.193 --> 37:03.593
Huh.

37:04.595 --> 37:06.696
It's over.

37:06.698 --> 37:09.699
But...

37:09.701 --> 37:12.301
I can make you better.

37:12.303 --> 37:15.271
I'm not the one
who's sick, John.

37:15.273 --> 37:19.075
Now drop the needle...

37:19.077 --> 37:22.345
or I'll tell them to shoot.

37:36.662 --> 37:37.761
Oh, John!

37:37.763 --> 37:39.763
It's ok. It's ok.

37:40.664 --> 37:42.031
On your knees.

37:48.805 --> 37:50.940
Let's go.

37:51.975 --> 37:54.543
"Body and soul
cannot be separated

37:54.545 --> 37:58.147
"for purposes of treatment,
for they are one indivisible.

37:58.149 --> 38:01.016
Sick minds must be healed
as well as sick bodies."

38:01.018 --> 38:03.085
Dr. Jeff Miller.

38:22.206 --> 38:23.906
Ok, kid.

38:23.908 --> 38:26.309
Out with it.

38:26.311 --> 38:27.310
Out with what?

38:27.312 --> 38:29.111
Out with the weirdness

38:29.113 --> 38:30.479
and the secrecy.

38:30.481 --> 38:33.247
That phone call that you could
only make out of a phone booth.

38:33.249 --> 38:36.083
I got a consultation.
What's the big deal?

38:36.085 --> 38:37.585
Reid, you left
that crime scene

38:37.587 --> 38:39.253
and came back
with a major break.

38:39.255 --> 38:40.754
That's one hell of a consult.

38:40.756 --> 38:44.091
Hmm. It was.

38:47.662 --> 38:50.497
All right, you don't
want to talk, that's fine.

38:50.499 --> 38:51.999
But listen.

38:52.001 --> 38:53.634
Seriously, I--

38:53.636 --> 38:57.237
I feel like you and I haven't
had a chance to talk in a while.

38:57.239 --> 39:00.373
It's nobody's fault.
It happens.

39:00.375 --> 39:04.310
But if you've got somebody
new in your life to talk to...

39:04.312 --> 39:06.745
I'd just like to know
who she is.

39:06.747 --> 39:12.051
She's gotta be one hell of a woman
to keep up with you.

39:14.388 --> 39:15.688
Who told you?

39:15.690 --> 39:17.423
Oh, just a little birdie.

39:17.425 --> 39:19.425
You might know her.

39:19.427 --> 39:21.728
Garcia told me.

39:21.730 --> 39:25.731
And she says you have been
acting a little squirrelly.

39:25.733 --> 39:29.235
So I just filled
the rest in.

39:29.237 --> 39:31.570
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:31.572 --> 39:33.172
Uh-huh.

39:33.174 --> 39:35.574
Play on, playa.

39:43.116 --> 39:44.783
Thank you.

39:44.785 --> 39:47.286
Mm-hmm.

39:51.491 --> 39:53.392
So I just wanted
to say thank you.

39:53.394 --> 39:54.793
You really helped a lot.

39:56.297 --> 39:58.864
I can't believe we've been
able to talk this much.

39:58.866 --> 40:01.367
3 times in one week.
That's a new record.

40:01.369 --> 40:03.702
I know. I like it.
Maybe we could test it out.

40:03.704 --> 40:06.205
You know, talking more often.

40:10.710 --> 40:12.577
Or not.

40:12.579 --> 40:14.245
Uh, I have to go.

40:14.247 --> 40:15.280
But why?

40:15.282 --> 40:17.749
No, it's nothing.

40:19.552 --> 40:21.486
You're not the only one
that can hear body language.

40:21.488 --> 40:23.188
Did I--did I say
something wrong?

40:23.190 --> 40:25.290
I, um...

40:25.292 --> 40:29.361
I'm just not sure it's safe
for us to talk right now.

40:29.363 --> 40:32.730
Do you think it's going
to be like this forever?

40:32.732 --> 40:36.334
I don't know. It's not how
I want us to be, I know that.

40:36.336 --> 40:38.836
My team and I are really
good at what we do.

40:38.838 --> 40:40.405
Why can't you just
let me help you?

40:40.407 --> 40:41.673
No, you can't ask that.

40:41.675 --> 40:43.141
I can help you.

40:43.143 --> 40:44.875
I'm not doing this for me.
I'm doing this for you,

40:44.877 --> 40:47.712
because I cannot let him hurt you,
because if he knew, he would--

40:52.419 --> 40:55.720
Please don't cry.

40:55.722 --> 40:57.822
I get it. I get it, ok?

40:57.824 --> 41:00.525
This is--this is how
it has to be.

41:00.527 --> 41:02.560
I understand.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.732
Are you still there?

41:08.435 --> 41:11.203
Yes. I'm still here.

41:11.205 --> 41:13.771
And, yes, this is how
it has to be,

41:13.773 --> 41:15.640
for today, at least.

41:15.642 --> 41:17.108
Ok.

41:17.110 --> 41:19.677
Well, guess I'll talk
to you next Sunday.

41:19.679 --> 41:21.578
Bye.

41:21.580 --> 41:24.014
Bye. Love you.
