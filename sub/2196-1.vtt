03:00.295 --> 03:03.003
- Hello.
- Hey, snuskebasse.

03:03.128 --> 03:08.045
- Are you still at work?
- Yes, Shawn and Debbie made a mess.

03:08.170 --> 03:12.628
And you save them as usual.
You work too hard, Todd.

03:12.753 --> 03:17.753
- Do not to pack my bags.
- Of course not.

03:17.878 --> 03:20.920
I mean it, Cammie.
Do not touch the bag.

03:21.045 --> 03:26.336
I do not like the idea
you unpack it as a servant.

03:26.461 --> 03:32.461
<i>- We drive to the cabin as soon as possible.
- I can hardly wait.</i>

03:33.003 --> 03:36.128
The same here, Cammie.

03:36.545 --> 03:38.628
Todd?

03:38.753 --> 03:42.545
- I love you.
- No, I love you.

03:44.628 --> 03:46.920
Goodbye.

03:54.628 --> 03:56.711
16 hours later

03:56.836 --> 04:02.086
We have lost a whole day. Your boss
can not treat you like this.

04:02.211 --> 04:07.211
- We should have run six hours before.
- What should I have done.

04:07.336 --> 04:11.003
If you do not say from
will never improve.

04:11.128 --> 04:17.128
I know that. I could stand just not
a confrontation at the time.

04:17.295 --> 04:22.461
I just thought: "Get it over with,
and came out to the lake."

04:22.586 --> 04:28.586
"Come down to the lake, look at the water,
and then it all washed away."

04:29.628 --> 04:34.795
It deserves you. But you must do
something about it. We can make a plan.

04:34.920 --> 04:39.711
Can we not talk
the work the rest of the trip?

04:39.836 --> 04:42.170
Sorry, I...

04:42.295 --> 04:48.295
I would only think
on two things this week: Cottage and you.

04:49.836 --> 04:52.503
Nothing more.

04:52.836 --> 04:58.836
I think it will be
the best trip to the cottage ever.

05:02.836 --> 05:06.086
Just wait till we get there.

05:07.711 --> 05:10.045
Okay.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.753
- Todd!
- Damn!

05:46.545 --> 05:49.336
Who is it?

06:53.086 --> 06:55.461
Todd?

07:25.378 --> 07:27.920
Let me see you.

07:33.461 --> 07:37.128
You are an angel.

07:38.003 --> 07:42.170
- I love you.
- No, I love you.

07:48.128 --> 07:50.920
- What?
- It is Sal.

07:51.420 --> 07:55.086
What? What's he doing here?

07:56.586 --> 08:01.170
- It's not his turn.
- Booked you on the website?

08:01.295 --> 08:05.253
I already made the website!
It's my turn.

08:05.711 --> 08:08.711
Hello, Toddie.

08:10.295 --> 08:16.295
- Good to see you. What are you doing here?
- I have booked the cottage all week.

08:17.128 --> 08:20.086
- Cammie, taxes.
- Salinger.

08:24.211 --> 08:30.211
- Mom said here was empty all week.
- She knows nothing. Check the page.

08:30.545 --> 08:36.044
- I have booked the entire week.
- Well, the website. Pis. Sorry.

08:36.169 --> 08:40.628
- Do not turn it on in here.
- I open the door.

08:40.753 --> 08:43.794
Do not, Sal.
Hello.

08:43.919 --> 08:47.628
Can you carry the bags up, Masha.
Thank you.

08:53.003 --> 08:57.003
It is God damn country.

09:06.836 --> 09:10.128
He is almost done.
I'm sure.

09:30.961 --> 09:34.253
- Breakfast is ready. Tea?
- Yes, a little bit.

09:34.378 --> 09:40.378
- I thought it was over between them.
- She shows up occasionally.

09:43.128 --> 09:49.003
Maybe it's not so bad that they
is here. We can be out on the lake.

09:49.128 --> 09:53.211
- We can row out to the island.
- No. Not while they are here.

09:53.336 --> 09:56.753
It is not intended,
they have to be part of this.

09:57.295 --> 10:00.545
Toodles. Our time together.

10:02.211 --> 10:07.961
It gives me chills,
they lurk around.

10:11.045 --> 10:16.420
- I get them to leave.
- And everything will be perfect.

10:17.003 --> 10:23.003
- You can rely on.
- You get them to leave?

10:23.128 --> 10:27.253
And now...
What about having breakfast, Miss?

10:27.378 --> 10:31.253
- Okay.
- It was John Wayne right there.

10:40.253 --> 10:44.836
Masha learned the secret
behind the perfect caesar salad -

10:44.961 --> 10:50.961
- On a small lortebar in Thailand
where there was kickboxing matches.

10:51.920 --> 10:55.420
What is the secret then, Masha?

11:00.961 --> 11:03.836
- What?
- Horseradish.

11:05.378 --> 11:07.795
Horseradish.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.961
If it does not burn,
do it wrong.

11:11.086 --> 11:14.128
That's what she said.

11:17.503 --> 11:22.420
- That's what she said.
- How's the painting?

11:25.586 --> 11:29.336
You know what. I do not paint anymore.

11:29.461 --> 11:34.628
It is too insipid yuppie fools
which will have something to hang up -

11:34.753 --> 11:38.378
- In their small,
arid occasions.

11:38.503 --> 11:43.795
It is the 21st century.
The only real art... is virtual.

11:44.503 --> 11:48.670
- Really?
- I get enough arts...

11:48.795 --> 11:54.795
...to a cool website and Masha
must complete the application forms.

11:55.503 --> 11:59.128
- What is it about?
- Masha gathers strangers up.

11:59.253 --> 12:04.086
So she gennempuler them
with a compressed air driven hammer fuck.

12:04.211 --> 12:09.420
- If you get arts funding for the kind of?
- Not to anyone. Come on.

12:09.545 --> 12:15.295
- It sounds like porn.
- That's not porn. It is art.

12:16.378 --> 12:22.211
It is ten billion times more genuine,
than what the hell you than doing.

12:22.336 --> 12:26.378
- I can never remember. What are you doing?
- I'm working.

12:27.336 --> 12:32.378
- I work 60-70 hours a week.
- Cool.

12:32.503 --> 12:37.045
I fistfucker life
with a nuclear-powered fuck hammer -

12:37.170 --> 12:41.086
60-70 hours per week.

12:41.211 --> 12:45.003
Who is the fool now?

12:46.253 --> 12:51.045
First fistfucker he lives,
and so he fistfucker me.

12:51.170 --> 12:54.920
There is very horseradish.
I love you.

12:56.503 --> 12:59.336
She is the ultimate rÃ¸vdronning.

13:17.711 --> 13:20.336
I'm bored.

13:26.003 --> 13:28.628
Hold the book.

13:35.920 --> 13:38.711
Closer.

13:49.878 --> 13:55.003
What the hell are you doing?
Sal, you know how dangerous it is.

14:00.753 --> 14:02.836
Do not do it.

14:21.170 --> 14:26.920
I would rape balls of you.
I'm bored!

14:27.045 --> 14:32.128
- Go out and pick mushrooms for dinner.
- Me. Picking mushrooms?

14:32.920 --> 14:36.628
- Do you poisoned?
- Take Cammie with.

14:36.753 --> 14:42.503
She loves to pick mushrooms.
Is not it true, Toodles.

14:43.711 --> 14:48.045
Fine, but you have to say
he must go.

14:48.170 --> 14:52.670
- You're not always so persistent.
- I ask him to leave.

14:53.420 --> 14:56.753
No, you do not ask.
You tell him.

14:56.878 --> 15:02.878
- They're gone in the morning.
- Fine. Come Masha, let's go.

15:05.628 --> 15:08.795
- An hour in the woods with that.
- You are a treasure.

15:08.920 --> 15:12.128
No, you're a treasure.

15:18.003 --> 15:24.003
- Are you going to walk with it?
- I do not look like a mannequin.

15:24.128 --> 15:29.878
I'm not cheap, so I do not go
out and looks like a mannequin from GAP.

15:31.211 --> 15:35.545
- A mannequin from GAP.
- Okay.

15:38.420 --> 15:42.086
- Bye, honey.
- They must be out.

16:13.045 --> 16:16.128
I am considering
to invite some friends.

16:16.253 --> 16:20.920
You're kidding.
The headphones. Sal!

16:22.336 --> 16:27.086
Sorry. I am considering
to invite some friends.

16:27.211 --> 16:29.586
Come on.

16:29.711 --> 16:34.753
I booked the cottage
to be alone with Cammie.

16:34.878 --> 16:37.795
And actually when I has evaporated -

16:37.920 --> 16:41.753
- I would row out to the island
and propose to her.

16:47.003 --> 16:51.461
Good luck, I just say.

16:51.586 --> 16:57.420
Are you deaf? I want the cottage.
I will be away before sunset.

16:57.545 --> 17:01.795
"Away before sunset."
Are you John Wayne, or what?

17:01.920 --> 17:05.752
It's not your cabin.
You will not dictate to me.

17:05.877 --> 17:10.252
You're like a five.
What have you performed in your life -

17:10.377 --> 17:14.836
- In addition to swipe the
one naive slut after another.

17:14.961 --> 17:18.920
If at any time
just work a single day -

17:19.045 --> 17:23.252
- And contribute to the society
as you so magical live in -

17:23.377 --> 17:29.378
- You could earn the
to be here. But until then: Smut.

17:34.128 --> 17:39.336
I'm so fucking tired of,
that you are who you are.

17:42.128 --> 17:45.086
Give me the damn headphones.

17:58.045 --> 18:04.045
You forced me to beat you.
They cost $ 300, you bastard!

18:18.920 --> 18:24.920
Hey, your pile of shit. I want
replacement for the headphones, Todd.

18:25.836 --> 18:29.545
They are important for my life.

18:29.670 --> 18:33.336
Your priorities
is completely out of the woods.

18:33.461 --> 18:36.378
- What did you say?
- Do not.

18:36.503 --> 18:40.503
Should I pinch you in the teat?
Do you like it?

18:41.128 --> 18:44.586
You hit me in the eye.
It did piss sorry, Todd!

18:44.711 --> 18:49.461
- Fine. I hate you.
- You owe me $ 300.

18:49.586 --> 18:52.753
- $ 300!
- I need to connect my head!

18:52.878 --> 18:55.253
Give it to me.

18:55.378 --> 18:59.461
Candy abenosser, you idiot.

19:15.878 --> 19:17.920
You stupid...

19:18.045 --> 19:20.670
Wedgie!

19:27.711 --> 19:32.378
Come here.
It's my turn to have the cottage.

19:32.836 --> 19:36.503
I booked it on the site.

19:36.628 --> 19:39.628
I'm not the idiot. That's you.

19:40.295 --> 19:46.170
I'm not the idiot.
That's you. You're the idiot.

19:46.295 --> 19:50.670
I'm not a complete idiot, you idiot!
Come on.

19:53.170 --> 19:55.461
Sal?

19:57.086 --> 19:59.628
Salinger!

20:19.628 --> 20:22.086
Oh, god.

21:00.503 --> 21:02.795
Come on.

23:02.128 --> 23:04.961
There's another one.

23:09.045 --> 23:12.795
- No, not that. It is poisonous.
- I know.

23:12.920 --> 23:16.003
I'm from a religious family.

23:16.128 --> 23:19.711
Father burned us when we were naughty.

23:20.711 --> 23:26.045
One day
melted his mother's face with the boiler.

23:26.170 --> 23:31.503
When she came back from the hospital,
she poisoned him with this fungus.

23:31.628 --> 23:35.378
He died. She went to jail.

23:35.503 --> 23:41.503
I was 13 when my foster parents
sexually abused me first time.

23:41.878 --> 23:46.336
Every time I see this sponge...

23:49.086 --> 23:51.253
...I feel...

23:53.128 --> 23:59.128
...all hands, tongues
and pikkene inside my body.

24:01.003 --> 24:04.503
I can not take it anymore.

24:11.211 --> 24:15.170
No, Masha! Spit it out!

24:15.295 --> 24:18.503
Spit on you!

24:19.420 --> 24:22.086
Oh, God!

24:25.836 --> 24:28.295
Stupid.

24:47.336 --> 24:49.336
Okay.

26:04.378 --> 26:07.003
<i>Salinger?</i>

26:08.503 --> 26:10.836
<i>Salinger?</i>

26:14.961 --> 26:18.420
- Hey, baby. You find some mushrooms?
- Yes.

26:18.545 --> 26:24.003
- We found one as big as your fist.
- So it must indeed be great.

26:24.128 --> 26:28.753
What happened to your head?
Been in a fight?

26:28.878 --> 26:34.878
- Have you quarreled with my chipmunk?
- No, it was so stupid.

26:35.836 --> 26:40.003
I took a swim and hit his head,
when I was going up.

26:40.128 --> 26:45.128
- Where are Salinger?
- I do not know. I was out to bathe.

26:53.878 --> 26:56.711
- Have you talked to him?
- Yes.

26:56.836 --> 27:01.586
- Is he leaving?
- Yes and no.

27:03.461 --> 27:06.086
Meet me on the porch.

27:16.420 --> 27:20.211
No, no, sit down. Sit.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.378
- Will you marry me?
- Here?

27:36.503 --> 27:41.753
No, at one of the fine hotels
at Niagara Falls.

27:41.878 --> 27:47.128
- Why will you ask here and not on the island?
- I had thought about me...

27:47.253 --> 27:53.253
...but things have changed,
and I will do it before I...

27:53.586 --> 27:57.378
- Before...
- What things have changed?

28:06.670 --> 28:09.753
Salinger is dead.

28:09.878 --> 28:13.295
- What do you say?
- I told him to get out of here...

28:13.420 --> 28:18.003
...and he did not take it so nicely,
since he is who he is.

28:18.128 --> 28:23.920
There was something stupid,
and I hit him with the ax.

28:24.045 --> 28:28.753
- Did you hit him with the ax?
- Yeah, I hit him with the ax.

28:28.878 --> 28:33.545
It was an accident.
He was pushing me.

28:35.711 --> 28:41.711
And then it happened. Sorry.
He's dead. It was not meant to be.

28:42.628 --> 28:46.753
Seriously? Is he dead?

28:48.795 --> 28:51.503
Where is he?

29:45.253 --> 29:50.670
You know, I can not say yes right now.
You must be free again on the island.

29:50.795 --> 29:54.670
But I'm sure
you will be happy with the answer.

29:54.795 --> 29:58.461
- Are not you mad at me?
- Toodles...

29:58.586 --> 30:03.920
You've done something really difficult.
A real manly things.

30:04.045 --> 30:09.711
- I will stand by your side all the time.
- Will you wait for me?

30:09.836 --> 30:15.045
- I'll be in jail.
- No, we will not let that happen.

30:16.128 --> 30:19.878
Nobody is going to believe
it was self-defense.

30:20.003 --> 30:26.003
Nobody is going to know something.
Not if we stick together.

30:26.711 --> 30:31.961
- Is not that what the ring means.
- I bought it, you liked.

30:32.086 --> 30:35.920
You did not think I saw it,
but I did.

30:37.545 --> 30:41.545
I turned my brother to death.
Do you know what that means?

30:41.670 --> 30:43.878
It means...

30:44.003 --> 30:50.003
When we create a family
we can come here as often as we want.

30:51.128 --> 30:54.086
For crying out loud.

30:55.170 --> 30:58.878
- I do not know.
- Todd!

30:59.003 --> 31:03.253
I am 34 years old,
and what have I accomplished?

31:03.378 --> 31:07.545
I am chief accountant for
a frostmadfirma. It's not enough.

31:07.670 --> 31:13.670
I want a family, and if you
You're going down, I'll find someone else.

31:13.836 --> 31:19.253
How long will it be before he will
to have children? And can I get some?

31:19.378 --> 31:21.878
My babe.

31:25.128 --> 31:30.836
Yes, there was something terrible,
but you wanted it.

31:30.961 --> 31:36.503
Make over your brother, but do not
to let it go beyond yourself.

31:38.545 --> 31:41.545
We also do not have to die, right?

31:43.003 --> 31:45.670
Oh, god.

31:48.878 --> 31:51.295
Okay.

31:51.961 --> 31:55.420
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

31:55.545 --> 32:00.836
- Do not do it for me.
- No, this is how I want it.

32:00.961 --> 32:05.211
- A zillion percent.
- Fine.

32:06.836 --> 32:09.753
Put the ring back in his pocket.

32:09.878 --> 32:15.295
We need to get it to look like,
as if they were never here.

32:21.378 --> 32:24.711
- Hello.
- Still nothing new about Salinger?

32:24.836 --> 32:27.920
- Has Todd did not say it to you?
- What?

32:28.045 --> 32:34.045
I must have forgotten it. Salinger
said he was going out with the kayak.

32:35.961 --> 32:41.503
- I fry some mushrooms for lunch.
- I'll help you cut.

32:41.628 --> 32:47.628
Moment. The kitchen floor is as
dirty when we fry mushrooms, so...

32:58.420 --> 33:04.378
Masha, you can rinse the mushrooms while
I get started in the oil and garlic?

33:21.961 --> 33:25.545
- Fine.
- You can use the little sponge.

33:26.170 --> 33:30.545
By the way,
I met someone on the way up here?

33:31.961 --> 33:34.878
No.

33:35.003 --> 33:37.670
It was midnight.

33:37.795 --> 33:42.920
I saw no one and no one saw you.

33:45.920 --> 33:51.045
It is only us
who knows that you are here in the hut?

33:51.503 --> 33:54.003
Yes, Cammie.

33:55.711 --> 33:59.253
- Anything else?
- Wait.

33:59.711 --> 34:03.878
- What?
- See here. Tax?

34:05.878 --> 34:11.878
How to make really delicious
fungi. Man pours them on the forehead.

34:14.795 --> 34:18.295
- And then touching one round.
- Yes.

34:18.960 --> 34:22.335
It continues to touch,
so they do not burn on.

34:24.753 --> 34:28.253
It's not what you think.

34:40.378 --> 34:44.003
- Do something.
- No, it's fine. You got her.

34:44.835 --> 34:49.920
- How long does it take?
- I do not know. You beat her.

34:50.045 --> 34:53.295
This had not happened,
if we had followed the plan!

34:53.420 --> 34:57.836
You do not know how hard it is
to kill another human being.

34:57.961 --> 35:01.836
- See here.
- What are you doing, Cammie?

35:11.586 --> 35:15.503
Shut up!

35:24.753 --> 35:29.503
That's it. That's it.
She's not going anywhere.

35:33.336 --> 35:36.670
It'll be fine.

35:48.420 --> 35:53.295
- What is it?
- I do not know. In the heat of battle.

35:53.420 --> 35:57.961
- Is it part of the plan?
- No.

35:58.920 --> 36:02.378
Be a good boyfriend and get the ax.

37:01.336 --> 37:04.211
Should we not move his car first?

37:04.336 --> 37:10.170
Is not it best to paddle, while
is bright and dump the car in the dark?

37:10.295 --> 37:15.503
- What if someone sees us sail?
- We are off to camp.

37:15.628 --> 37:21.628
It looks more suspiciously out
paddling in the dark.

37:22.211 --> 37:26.086
So we leave the car at home
while we are away.

37:26.211 --> 37:31.545
- Do you want to move it now?
- No, I suppose not.

37:31.670 --> 37:34.086
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

37:34.211 --> 37:38.045
- Just let me know if you are not.
- I'm sure.

37:38.170 --> 37:41.753
Why you mentioned it at all?

37:43.795 --> 37:47.795
- I love you.
- And I love you.

37:50.836 --> 37:55.086
- One, two...
- Wait, I need to loosen the canoe.

39:10.878 --> 39:14.211
Cammie Ryan, will you marry me?

39:15.795 --> 39:17.795
Yes.

39:18.628 --> 39:21.045
Yes!

39:36.045 --> 39:41.878
Tax. What car are you?
Our or Salinger?

39:42.003 --> 39:48.003
- What's the plan?
- I can not think clearly.

39:48.711 --> 39:52.836
That's why we have a plan.
So you should not think.

39:52.961 --> 39:56.836
- You're Salinger, I'll take ours.
- Fine, well.

39:56.961 --> 39:59.253
I see. Sorry.

39:59.378 --> 40:04.586
I can not relax until we
has dumped the car and everything is quiet.

40:04.711 --> 40:10.628
That's fine, honey.
Everything goes right by our head.

40:15.336 --> 40:18.128
Someone party.

40:22.003 --> 40:26.878
- Did you leave the lights on?
- For hole instructions indeed!

40:27.586 --> 40:30.128
Paddle!

40:33.920 --> 40:39.920
He had already invited them.
Salinger said, but I said no.

40:48.586 --> 40:52.586
If you had said this,
we had moved the car first.

40:52.711 --> 40:56.211
- I told you.
- You did not tell me everything.

40:56.336 --> 41:00.670
- So we had moved on.
- Fine, you're right.

41:01.461 --> 41:07.461
- From now on I will tell you everything.
- How insignificant it is.

41:08.586 --> 41:12.128
- Is there anything else you would like to share?
- No.

41:13.545 --> 41:17.336
Okay, let's put our alibi.

41:33.961 --> 41:39.253
Has anyone seen Salinger? My brother.

41:39.378 --> 41:45.003
- Are you his brother?
- Yes. Todd. Todd Chipowski.

41:49.170 --> 41:55.170
Have you seen Salinger?
The guy who invited you here.

42:04.420 --> 42:06.378
Salinger!

42:34.586 --> 42:39.295
If you could fuck with anyone
anything here, who would you choose?

42:39.420 --> 42:41.586
My boyfriend.

42:43.753 --> 42:47.128
- Are you Todd's girlfriend?
- Cammie.

42:47.253 --> 42:53.253
I am orthodox. I have not
touch women outside the family.

42:54.961 --> 42:59.295
- Is this your friends?
- I have known Salinger long.

42:59.420 --> 43:05.420
We studied art together,
but I chose not Salinger's way.

43:06.253 --> 43:09.836
- I'm still studying.
- What are you studying?

43:09.961 --> 43:15.170
- Torah. I leave from Yeshiva.
- Yeshiva, yes.

43:16.586 --> 43:21.128
- They are amazing.
- It is a religious school for Jews.

43:21.253 --> 43:26.503
Come on. So you get
completely from the Holy Land?

43:26.628 --> 43:29.920
From New York City.

43:33.586 --> 43:37.253
- How exciting.
- It can be.

43:37.378 --> 43:41.795
- Have you seen Salinger?
- Is not he here?

43:41.920 --> 43:47.920
The door was unlocked when we came. His car
are here, but no one has seen them.

43:48.836 --> 43:54.128
- He does not answer.
- We've been out in the canoe all day.

43:54.253 --> 44:00.253
We went to the waterfall and to the island.
We were not here when he came.

44:00.586 --> 44:05.170
- We did not know he was coming.
- So I waited probably not us?

44:05.295 --> 44:10.961
- It was a bit of a shock.
- Typical Salinger.

44:13.128 --> 44:19.128
- When you said you left?
- I did not. This morning.

44:19.295 --> 44:25.295
I am trying to create a timeline
to figure out when he was away.

44:25.420 --> 44:29.461
You make it sound,
as if he has disappeared.

44:29.586 --> 44:34.753
He and Masha trains safely in the woods
and was crooked. You know the ones.

44:34.878 --> 44:40.878
Yes, that's why I'm worried.
Maybe we should start looking.

44:41.253 --> 44:45.003
- Based on what?
- Because...

44:45.128 --> 44:51.128
...a completely unreliable and
absentminded guy does not have emerged.

44:52.086 --> 44:54.628
You are right.

44:55.836 --> 45:00.420
- Relax and enjoy the party.
- I will.

45:02.253 --> 45:08.253
Just to confirm: Salinger's car
was not here last night?

45:08.920 --> 45:13.878
No. It was neither here
last night or this morning.

45:14.003 --> 45:18.253
It is so strange.
He texted me yesterday.

45:19.503 --> 45:23.211
- What did he say?
- He wrote...

45:28.003 --> 45:34.003
"Shalom, dude. Just got.
Sea control. See you maÃ±ana."

45:35.086 --> 45:37.545
It's from yesterday.

45:37.670 --> 45:41.753
It says nothing about the cabin.
He mentions only the lake.

45:41.878 --> 45:47.878
Maybe they slept under the stars.
They do probably now.

45:50.545 --> 45:54.503
Yes, it is probably just what they do.

45:55.545 --> 46:01.545
- I stop worrying now.
- It's nice that you show care.

46:02.253 --> 46:07.461
If you see Salinger, would you say,
that Todd will talk to him.

46:07.586 --> 46:10.628
- Okay.
- Hello.

46:30.795 --> 46:34.045
- Hi, Todd.
- Dov.

46:35.586 --> 46:41.586
- What a party. When the slips?
- When there is more than one substance.

46:41.795 --> 46:47.795
It is gas. On Sunday.
A portion going back to work.

46:48.378 --> 46:52.753
It will be good
to get the place to ourselves.

46:52.878 --> 46:57.503
I hope it creates discord
between you and Salinger.

46:57.628 --> 47:01.586
I have not seen him today.

47:02.795 --> 47:08.795
We left this morning and came
back to this. Surprise!

47:10.170 --> 47:16.170
- I have not seen him.
- Was his car here yesterday?

47:17.461 --> 47:21.545
No, he must have come,
while we were out.

47:21.670 --> 47:26.211
- When did you last see him?
- I do not know.

47:26.336 --> 47:32.003
- At Easter, perhaps.
- I know you are not the best of friends.

47:32.128 --> 47:35.628
- But he looks up to you.
- No, he does not.

47:35.753 --> 47:41.295
He would not want me to say it, but
he respects your hard work.

47:41.420 --> 47:46.003
It inspires him to
to work harder with his art.

47:46.128 --> 47:49.461
Although. It's good to hear.

47:51.211 --> 47:54.836
What did you do with the head?

47:54.961 --> 47:59.128
That was stupid. I slapped me
on the bridge, when I swam.

47:59.253 --> 48:02.461
- Av. When did it happen?
- This morning.

48:03.503 --> 48:09.003
- Before the canoe trip?
- Yes. I...

48:09.753 --> 48:15.753
I usually take
an early morning swim.

48:16.170 --> 48:20.628
- I get smoke in your eyes.
- What time was it?

48:21.253 --> 48:26.795
- Fairly early. At six o'clock.
- I do not know. Are you asking me?

48:26.920 --> 48:29.211
At six o'clock.

48:29.336 --> 48:33.461
I'm trying to find out
When Salinger may have arrived.

48:33.586 --> 48:36.795
Yeah, where the hell is this prat?

48:38.711 --> 48:42.461
- Where do you think Salinger is?
- I do not know.

48:43.045 --> 48:49.045
You know him better than I do.
Tell him that I'm looking for him.

48:51.170 --> 48:53.795
Good night, Todd.

49:10.003 --> 49:14.753
- Hey, sweetie. How are you?
- I can not take it anymore.

49:14.878 --> 49:18.253
Do away.
I need peace and quiet.

49:18.378 --> 49:23.586
I have not
had a moment's peace since we came.

49:23.711 --> 49:29.711
It'll be fine. You'll have peace soon.
Just pull yourself together.

49:29.878 --> 49:31.920
Todd.

49:32.045 --> 49:36.128
- What?
- We need a fourth man.

49:36.711 --> 49:39.420
Me?

49:48.753 --> 49:52.170
What we play on.
Five cents per point?

49:53.586 --> 49:57.128
You guys are already four.

49:57.253 --> 50:01.170
One, two, three...

50:03.503 --> 50:07.211
What's the matter?

50:10.586 --> 50:13.753
What?

50:15.086 --> 50:19.378
What's wrong?
I have no beer.

50:21.503 --> 50:25.128
Where's my beer?

50:25.253 --> 50:30.711
I'll get one for you.
What the hell is happening to you?

50:34.420 --> 50:37.920
- Here.
- Thank you, darling.

50:41.878 --> 50:45.253
Cheers to life in a cabin -

50:45.378 --> 50:51.336
- And for my little brother Salinger,
who miss his own party.

51:05.545 --> 51:09.628
- Get out of my cabin!
- I can not. You killed me!

51:09.753 --> 51:14.128
No, I booked the cottage
on the website.

51:14.253 --> 51:18.295
I go down to the bridge
and enjoying the view.

51:18.420 --> 51:21.086
I had dreams -

51:21.211 --> 51:25.086
- But you chopped them
into pieces and threw them into the lake.

51:25.211 --> 51:31.003
Every time you hear a loon cry, is
I who fucks the crazy!

51:31.128 --> 51:37.128
I swear I will strangle
every diver in the lake!

51:38.461 --> 51:41.295
Get out!

51:49.878 --> 51:53.336
How it should be.

51:58.086 --> 52:01.920
That's it. Let's play euchre.

52:03.420 --> 52:08.378
- Ace plays out?
- Toodles. You're really tired.

52:08.503 --> 52:13.336
Let's go to bed.
Sorry, he's got sunstroke.

52:13.461 --> 52:18.753
- He should be allowed to sleep out.
- Are you coming to bed?

52:21.461 --> 52:24.753
Good night, everyone.

52:24.878 --> 52:28.878
- Do not make noise so much.
- Come on.

53:17.253 --> 53:20.295
Is it kosher?

53:21.711 --> 53:25.086
My rabbi has blessed it.

53:27.253 --> 53:30.628
I have not
done since high school.

53:37.586 --> 53:43.586
- Not very orthodox.
- I'm more into mysticism.

53:44.128 --> 53:50.128
Some mystics say you should
be bad before you can be good.

53:51.836 --> 53:55.170
I try to be really good.

53:59.795 --> 54:02.003
Be honest.

54:02.128 --> 54:07.836
Do you want to become one with the
universe, or you wonder about Salinger?

54:07.961 --> 54:13.961
It's weird, right?
The car is here, but it is not.

54:14.211 --> 54:17.961
I'm worried.
Why are you not?

54:22.420 --> 54:27.961
- Maybe I have thought about other things.
- Like what?

54:28.628 --> 54:34.461
- If I can undo?
- Regret what?

54:34.586 --> 54:40.586
Since you asked who I would rather
do it with, I told my girlfriend.

54:43.753 --> 54:46.586
I regret it.

54:51.420 --> 54:53.461
They are so cute.

54:53.586 --> 54:59.586
- What are you doing?
- Todd. Did you have nightmares?

55:00.003 --> 55:05.586
- Cammie, what are you doing?
- You snored. I could not sleep.

55:07.878 --> 55:11.295
Since when are you smoking something?

55:13.920 --> 55:18.336
There is evidently
a lot of strange things in the cottage.

55:18.461 --> 55:23.295
- Will you please come back to bed?
- If you stop snoring.

55:33.795 --> 55:36.086
Todd.

55:38.295 --> 55:40.711
Todd!

56:05.253 --> 56:10.170
Hell, Todd! You have
something about Salinger, right?

56:10.295 --> 56:15.378
No, I have no idea
how they ended up in the lake.

56:15.920 --> 56:21.045
If you had said it before you run
I might have believed you.

56:21.170 --> 56:25.545
- I'm not so good at something.
- What?

56:26.711 --> 56:31.128
- I will not talk about it.
- What have you done?

56:33.545 --> 56:39.003
- Give me the headphones.
- What have you done to Salinger?

56:39.128 --> 56:42.961
- Give me the headphones, Dov.
- Stay away.

56:43.336 --> 56:47.378
- Give me the headphones.
- Go along h to!

56:48.836 --> 56:52.045
Come here, Dov.

57:56.336 --> 57:58.795
Sorry.

58:11.086 --> 58:13.628
Close your eyes.

58:15.086 --> 58:20.378
The universe is waiting for you
with a big hug.

58:28.795 --> 58:34.795
Get the ax. You chopped the other
apart. Now it's his turn.

58:35.336 --> 58:41.336
He is not like them. He is a jew.
A Jew's body to be buried whole.

58:41.628 --> 58:45.503
- Seriously?
- We can not destroy his afterlife.

58:45.628 --> 58:51.628
- Should we dump him like that?
- No, snuskesbasse. It does not.

58:52.003 --> 58:56.711
- Why not?
- Jews must be buried in the ground.

58:56.836 --> 59:02.836
It is God's law, not mine.
We have killed one of God's chosen.

59:04.711 --> 59:09.336
- Do you want our house haunted?
- No.

59:09.461 --> 59:14.461
- How do you know all this?
- I've been to bar mitzva'er.

59:17.795 --> 59:22.420
I'll get the shovel.
He should be buried. He is a jew.

59:53.670 --> 59:56.545
We ought to say a prayer.

59:56.670 --> 59:59.795
- Do you know any?
- No.

59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.920
- Do you?
- No.

01:00:21.628 --> 01:00:23.753
Okay.

01:00:30.003 --> 01:00:35.711
- I fry anything.
- French toast, maybe.

01:00:51.545 --> 01:00:54.336
Who is it?

01:00:55.170 --> 01:00:58.670
- Who is it, Todd?
- The police.

01:00:59.378 --> 01:01:04.503
- What will you do and say?
- Shut up and go upstairs.

01:01:04.628 --> 01:01:08.711
- Do not panic.
- Go upstairs.

01:01:20.628 --> 01:01:24.211
Good morning. Is this your cabin?

01:01:24.336 --> 01:01:30.336
Yes, I'm sorry. We held a party
yesterday, and it was maybe a little high.

01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:38.170
- It will not happen again.
- I am looking for Dov Rosenberg.

01:01:39.003 --> 01:01:45.003
- I do not know if there was a Dov here.
- Do not you know who your customers are?

01:01:45.795 --> 01:01:51.753
It's my brother's friends.
I do not know really...

01:01:51.878 --> 01:01:57.878
It's not my party.
I just cleans up after them.

01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:03.253
- What is your name, sir?
- Todd. Todd Chipowski.

01:02:04.545 --> 01:02:06.753
Mr. Chipowski.

01:02:06.878 --> 01:02:12.878
We got a call from Dov Rosenberg
about a missing person.

01:02:13.378 --> 01:02:16.045
Who is missing?

01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:20.795
Rosenberg said he had arrived
to Salinger Chipowskis cabin.

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:26.920
His car was outside,
but he and his girlfriend was not there.

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:33.503
Mr. Rosenberg was concerned,
if they were lost in the forest -

01:02:33.628 --> 01:02:36.961
Or "something worse".

01:02:38.545 --> 01:02:44.170
- Are you related to mr. Chipowski.
- Yes.

01:02:45.253 --> 01:02:51.128
He's my brother, but missed...
It is brittle.

01:02:51.253 --> 01:02:55.461
He is the
most unreliable human.

01:02:55.586 --> 01:03:01.586
This Dov overreacted safely.
He was as tall as a skyscraper.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:09.253
Is mr. Rosenberg present,
so I can talk to him?

01:03:11.628 --> 01:03:13.628
Dov!

01:03:14.628 --> 01:03:19.128
They partied through yesterday.
Dov!

01:03:20.753 --> 01:03:23.795
What is it, Toodles.

01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:29.336
Police constable Mackenzie
looking for Dov Rosenberg.

01:03:29.461 --> 01:03:35.461
He called yesterday,
because he was worried about Salinger.

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:44.420
He is certainly a brackish or
else. I'm looking for.

01:03:52.211 --> 01:03:56.586
He put all a message?
Looking at it.

01:04:00.836 --> 01:04:04.253
Where is he? Where is he?
Find him.

01:04:09.836 --> 01:04:14.170
- We must find a new alibi.
- A new alibi?

01:04:14.295 --> 01:04:17.878
- I have a plan.
- Of course you have.

01:04:26.253 --> 01:04:31.003
Where is it? Have you found it? Nice.

01:04:31.128 --> 01:04:33.878
Good dog.

01:04:51.128 --> 01:04:55.253
We were out on the lake all day.
I never met my brother.

01:04:55.378 --> 01:05:00.045
I did not see his car,
before we came back.

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:02.920
Dov, he who called you -

01:05:03.045 --> 01:05:08.378
- Said something about
that he would take a natsvÃ¸mmetur.

01:05:08.503 --> 01:05:12.045
He drank a lot, so maybe...

01:05:16.170 --> 01:05:18.586
There was one thing...

01:05:18.711 --> 01:05:23.045
I was not thinking about it,
but in the circumstances...

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:28.711
There was this oddball,
since we paddled into.

01:05:28.836 --> 01:05:32.878
There was this creepy, weird guy.

01:05:33.003 --> 01:05:38.336
He lurked among the trees.
I felt uncomfortable.

01:05:38.461 --> 01:05:41.795
He had a vaskebjÃ¸rneskindshue on.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.836
I waved to him,
and so he ran away.

01:05:45.961 --> 01:05:49.836
- I do not know if it means anything.
- Completely bizarre.

01:06:15.711 --> 01:06:18.586
Hi, Dad.

01:06:39.378 --> 01:06:42.336
I do not know what might have happened.

01:06:42.461 --> 01:06:47.253
- They found blood on the ground.
- Maybe it was not his blood.

01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:52.295
- Where else would it be?
- A rabbit.

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:56.836
Maybe beat a bear
a rabbit to death in front of the hut.

01:06:56.961 --> 01:07:01.920
- Why would the bear hide blood?
- Instinct.

01:07:06.795 --> 01:07:12.586
Maybe he never came. It did not,
as if he had decided.

01:07:12.711 --> 01:07:17.003
Did you talk to Salinger
to take up here?

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:21.545
Todd booked the cottage. Salinger had
never have been here.

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:27.003
Mary, did you say to Salinger,
that he could come up here?

01:07:27.128 --> 01:07:31.128
He called and asked
the cabin was vacant.

01:07:31.253 --> 01:07:36.420
I thought
I had checked the website.

01:07:36.545 --> 01:07:40.836
It has been this way for 35 years.
You think you never about!

01:07:41.586 --> 01:07:45.503
If our boy is dead
it's your fault.

01:07:45.628 --> 01:07:48.253
Jesus!

01:07:53.545 --> 01:07:59.420
It'll be all right, Mary.
It is hard for all of us.

01:08:00.378 --> 01:08:04.170
But if we are missing
after a bright spot...

01:08:05.211 --> 01:08:08.628
See the ring Todd gave me.

01:08:12.461 --> 01:08:14.086
Yes.

01:08:19.836 --> 01:08:25.836
That's funny. I thought
I would learn to love your mother -

01:08:27.211 --> 01:08:31.127
- But you and Salinger
I loved from the beginning.

01:08:31.252 --> 01:08:37.127
Then came as something good
out of the damn marriage.

01:08:46.752 --> 01:08:52.336
- The police will find out.
- I think Cammie not.

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:58.461
Cammie, Cammie, Staple Cammie.
What do you get really out of it?

01:08:58.877 --> 01:09:03.295
Lifetime with her.
Is that really what you want?

01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:09.420
- I already proposed to her.
- Yes, but why did you do it?

01:09:10.002 --> 01:09:14.795
If you had waited a little, you could
have got a treat as Masha.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:18.586
I have seen
how you look at me, Todd.

01:09:19.377 --> 01:09:22.461
Do you like it? I like it.

01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:30.045
You could have had me.
You should have just asked.

01:09:45.377 --> 01:09:50.295
- Todd? Who are you talking to?
- None.

01:09:54.461 --> 01:09:58.420
I imagine a June wedding.

01:09:58.545 --> 01:10:04.545
Yes, we ought to look for party rooms,
when we come back to the city.

01:10:05.545 --> 01:10:10.836
I thought we could do it here.
A small, stylish ceremony.

01:10:10.961 --> 01:10:16.961
Guests coming by boat, and we can
garden lights and flowers along the path.

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:23.420
- Would not it be great?
- After all that has happened here?

01:10:24.878 --> 01:10:30.878
Our children and grandchildren
happiest memories will be here.

01:10:31.003 --> 01:10:34.086
It should be our family's soul.

01:10:34.211 --> 01:10:40.211
I do not know if my parents are with
on the. Things considered.

01:10:41.586 --> 01:10:45.378
Nowhere
will be as perfect as here.

01:10:47.003 --> 01:10:50.086
I can ask them.

01:10:50.211 --> 01:10:55.003
- I love you, Toodles.
- I love you, snuskebasse.

01:10:57.545 --> 01:11:01.128
Fine.
Move away from my side of the bed.

01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:28.253
The stain is not gone by.

01:11:28.378 --> 01:11:33.586
Dry cleaners said it would get rid of,
but it is not.

01:11:34.711 --> 01:11:39.170
Has anyone detergent?
No? They have not.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:43.003
They have no detergent.

01:11:44.878 --> 01:11:50.878
Where is everyone going?
I shall not go. It's my wedding!

01:11:51.170 --> 01:11:54.753
I should not ruin my wedding!

01:11:55.128 --> 01:12:01.128
You idiot! You did not know there was
so much blood inside your brother?

01:12:58.795 --> 01:13:02.461
It's the police.

01:13:02.836 --> 01:13:06.503
We're looking
for missing people in the area.

01:13:19.170 --> 01:13:21.253
Pis.

01:13:39.045 --> 01:13:42.961
It's the police! Is this your cabin?

01:13:47.170 --> 01:13:52.003
If you do not answer, I assume
from you is an illegal intruders.

01:13:52.878 --> 01:13:58.836
Shut the fuck up! Keep to scream.
Put your hands on the floor.

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.586
Stop!

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:31.378
I saw a blue heron at Evans's.

01:14:31.503 --> 01:14:34.795
- Was it great?
- Aim high.

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:39.420
- Have you written it in the bird book?
- No, I forgot the pencil.

01:14:39.545 --> 01:14:45.503
- Did you bring the new mustard out?
- I have taken the new mustard out.

01:14:45.628 --> 01:14:50.086
- We are considering a June wedding.
- Have I given you for a date?

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:56.586
- Then I look for rooms.
- We will have a banquet room.

01:14:57.295 --> 01:15:01.253
- We'll keep it here.
- Why?

01:15:01.836 --> 01:15:07.211
Because, Mom, it would make it
something special -

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:10.836
- And that would mean
a lot of Cammie and me.

01:15:10.961 --> 01:15:15.003
How would it be special?

01:15:16.253 --> 01:15:21.045
Despite the fact that there are some
shall we say obvious -

01:15:21.170 --> 01:15:27.170
- And a bad connotation
there are also good associations here.

01:15:28.045 --> 01:15:34.045
- I know you love to watch the birds.
- Invite people up here? How?

01:15:34.253 --> 01:15:37.961
You can do it
a memory for Salinger.

01:15:39.878 --> 01:15:43.878
That is sick. You are sick.

01:15:44.003 --> 01:15:50.003
Do you have a party the same place,
as your brother was murdered?

01:15:50.795 --> 01:15:53.003
No.

01:16:07.128 --> 01:16:10.878
Want to see your grandchildren, mother?

01:16:11.670 --> 01:16:16.336
Because when we have children -

01:16:16.461 --> 01:16:20.795
- We can say
You gave us your blessing -

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:24.378
And you gave us your full support.

01:16:24.503 --> 01:16:28.628
Or we can tell you -

01:16:28.753 --> 01:16:32.586
- The reason
they never see their grandparents -

01:16:32.711 --> 01:16:38.545
Is because they did not care.

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:51.920
Todd?

01:16:53.253 --> 01:16:56.128
Did you kill your brother?

01:16:57.295 --> 01:17:02.086
What? It is...

01:17:03.211 --> 01:17:07.545
Cammie... No. No.

01:17:07.670 --> 01:17:11.545
You fucking bastard!

01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:17.670
How dare you? You're protected
Salinger his whole life and now in death.

01:17:18.753 --> 01:17:24.045
You have two sons. One of them is still
alive, and he does something great.

01:17:24.170 --> 01:17:27.461
But you are trying to sabotage him -

01:17:27.586 --> 01:17:31.253
- Because you need
one to blame.

01:17:31.378 --> 01:17:37.378
- He needed extra care.
- Apologize to your son...

01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:41.920
...and tell him he's welcome
to marry here in the hut!

01:17:42.045 --> 01:17:45.211
Otherwise, I swear by God -

01:17:45.336 --> 01:17:51.170
- The divorce papers waiting,
when I get home!

01:17:51.711 --> 01:17:54.920
Say you're sorry!

01:17:59.670 --> 01:18:02.420
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

01:18:02.545 --> 01:18:08.086
I should like to marry here.
I have to be here as often as you want.

01:18:08.211 --> 01:18:14.211
Thank you, Mary. We are happy.
It's great. Thank you.

01:18:16.628 --> 01:18:20.128
She forgot the pencil again.

01:18:20.711 --> 01:18:24.128
This is it.

01:18:26.170 --> 01:18:28.628
Toodles.

01:19:07.836 --> 01:19:09.878
Yes?

01:19:14.253 --> 01:19:18.878
Really? That I must say.

01:19:20.961 --> 01:19:26.961
No, Gruber used to be
in the Netherlands now. Netherlands.

01:19:30.045 --> 01:19:33.420
Right now? Where are you?

01:19:36.753 --> 01:19:40.170
Yes, I know where it is.

01:19:40.795 --> 01:19:42.920
Goodbye.

01:19:44.045 --> 01:19:48.045
- What?
- It was the police.

01:19:50.086 --> 01:19:54.711
They have caught the tramp.
He lived in Gruber's cabin.

01:19:54.836 --> 01:20:00.461
They think he is crazy enough to have
killed Masha, Salinger and Dov.

01:20:00.586 --> 01:20:05.753
Oh god, that's fantastic.

01:20:05.878 --> 01:20:11.878
- We need to identify him.
- So let's do it.

01:20:12.295 --> 01:20:17.711
No, I will report
myself to the police.

01:20:19.961 --> 01:20:25.086
But they think you he did it.
Is not it great?

01:20:25.211 --> 01:20:30.753
One last thing, and it's over.
Then we can do what we want.

01:20:30.878 --> 01:20:35.336
No. No. No, look at us!

01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:39.670
See what I just did to mom.

01:20:39.795 --> 01:20:45.795
We have done disgusting things,
and it will never end.

01:20:46.628 --> 01:20:52.628
- I tell everything to the police.
- You have never completed anything.

01:20:53.086 --> 01:20:59.086
When I make a plan, I stick
to it. Why it is called a plan.

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:05.253
I will not be with you
rest of their lives. I do not love you.

01:21:06.670 --> 01:21:10.128
I've never done.

01:21:10.753 --> 01:21:14.378
So I have it also with you, Todd.

01:21:15.045 --> 01:21:21.045
You are loyal and kind,
but you are a lump of fat-free yogurt.

01:21:24.711 --> 01:21:28.670
Damn.
Can we even like each other?

01:21:29.295 --> 01:21:33.545
Is it important?
It is called obligations.

01:21:33.670 --> 01:21:37.545
How dare you go
in the middle of an argument?

01:21:51.086 --> 01:21:55.336
Todd came out of the car.
What are you doing?

01:21:55.461 --> 01:21:59.378
Listen, Toodles.

01:22:21.961 --> 01:22:24.670
Pis.

01:22:25.461 --> 01:22:31.086
You fucking coward. I have put
too much of that shit matters.

01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:48.378
Pick up the phone, Todd.

01:22:50.211 --> 01:22:52.086
Pis.

01:22:58.378 --> 01:23:02.295
- Pull off the road, damn it!
- Cammie.

01:23:04.003 --> 01:23:06.003
Shit!

01:23:10.961 --> 01:23:13.961
Pick up the phone.

01:23:15.878 --> 01:23:19.545
- Your phone.
- No.

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:31.420
Stop. We need to talk.

01:23:45.045 --> 01:23:49.045
No. Do do this.
P. S. You drive miserable.

01:24:10.003 --> 01:24:14.586
- Do not, Todd.
- It's over, Cammie.

01:24:14.711 --> 01:24:18.003
- No.
- Yes. You can keep the ring.

01:24:19.461 --> 01:24:22.253
Pussy phiz.

01:24:29.461 --> 01:24:33.295
- Is it them?
- Yes, one of them.

01:24:35.253 --> 01:24:39.795
I have arrested the wrong man.
He is innocent. It was...

01:24:44.545 --> 01:24:49.086
You do not say
I have to keep the shit ring.

01:25:34.128 --> 01:25:36.503

01:27:25.795 --> 01:27:30.003
