00:27.734 --> 00:29.367

THIS PAINTING HAS BEEN
HANGING IN THE TIPTON

01:18.300 --> 01:19.600
FOR NEARLY 100 YEARS.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.233
WELL, GOOD.
NOW YOU CAN BUY A NEW ONE.

01:22.233 --> 01:23.967
OLD IS GOOD.

01:23.967 --> 01:27.667
AND THAT'S
WHAT MAKES YOU GREAT.

01:28.300 --> 01:30.200
OH, MR. MOSEBY, FORGIVE US.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.367
BACK HOME, THEY WOULD TIE
MY ARMS AND LEGS TO 4 GOATS

01:33.367 --> 01:34.667
AND SEND THEM OFF
IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

01:34.667 --> 01:37.700
IT IS ALSO WHAT THEY DO
FOR PEOPLE WITH BAD BACKS.

01:37.700 --> 01:41.200
WHICH IS WHAT YOU'LL HAVE
AFTER WORKING A DOUBLE SHIFT.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.934
I'D BETTER FIND A GOAT.

01:44.734 --> 01:46.300
WHO IS GOING
TO PAY FOR THIS?

01:46.300 --> 01:48.100
DO YOU TAKE GAME TOKENS?

01:48.100 --> 01:49.734
KEEP YOUR TOKENS

01:49.734 --> 01:50.934

I CAN'T GET THE CHEESE
TO HARDEN QUITE RIGHT.

02:00.066 --> 02:01.734
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

02:01.734 --> 02:03.700
I CAN FIX THIS, THOUGH,

02:03.700 --> 02:05.600
WITH MY NEW
SUPER-STRENGTH GLUE.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.300
I CALL IT

SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO.

02:12.300 --> 02:12.867
CHECK THIS OUT.

02:12.867 --> 02:16.200
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PUT
A LITTLE DROP DOWN HERE,

02:16.200 --> 02:17.767
A LITTLE DROP UP HERE,

02:17.767 --> 02:19.767
AND THEN YOU STICK IT
DOWN THERE

02:19.767 --> 02:21.767
AND STICK IT UP HERE,

02:21.767 --> 02:22.934
AND VOILA!

02:22.934 --> 02:25.500
SMOKE!
NO, THANKS.
IT'S A NASTY HABIT.

02:25.500 --> 02:26.867
NO, THE FRAME
IS SMOKING!

02:26.867 --> 02:29.600
THAT IS THE SILLIEST THING
I'VE EVER--

02:29.600 --> 02:30.600
AAH!

02:44.400 --> 02:46.300
UNTIL I TRY
TO STICK IT
TO SOMETHING.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.500
WHICH IS KIND OF
THE POINT OF GLUE.

02:48.500 --> 02:52.800
WELL, I'D GO BACK
TO THE DRAWING BOARD,

02:52.800 --> 02:56.100
BUT IT EXPLODED, TOO.

02:58.700 --> 02:59.900
WHAT'S THAT?

02:59.900 --> 03:03.100
IT'S A NEWSPAPER

SO THERE'S MONEY
HIDDEN SOMEWHERE
IN THIS HOTEL?

03:20.767 --> 03:23.700
IT COULD BE MILLIONS!

03:23.700 --> 03:26.667

04:12.567 --> 04:16.000
I'VE GOT TO ASK MOM
FOR MY OWN ROOM.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.767
IF WE FIND
THIS TREASURE,

04:17.767 --> 04:19.200
YOU COULD HAVE
YOUR OWN HOUSE.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.800

I'D SPEND MY MONEY ON.

WHO WAS ACTUALLY THERE.

07:59.200 --> 07:59.800

WHEN WE SPLIT THE LOOT.

TO COUNT IT.

08:15.100 --> 08:17.100
TO ASK HIM WHERE
THE TREASURE IS.

08:17.100 --> 08:23.133

"THE TREASURE LIES

TO CUT HIM IN.

20:45.367 --> 20:48.900
HOLD IT!

20:48.900 --> 20:50.500
HERE, TAKE IT.

20:50.500 --> 20:54.867
I COULD NEVER GET
THE DARN THING OPEN ANYWAY.

21:02.033 --> 21:02.700
"TO MURIEL,

21:02.700 --> 21:06.867
YOU ARE
MY GREATEST TREASURE."

21:09.667 --> 21:13.300
MURIEL, YOU WERE
THE TREASURE ALL ALONG.

21:13.300 --> 21:17.700
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
ALL THE CHEAP GUYS SAY

21:17.700 --> 21:19.100
WHEN THEY DON'T
WANT TO SPRING

21:19.100 --> 21:22.200
FOR THE GOOD JEWELRY.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.233
NOW I'LL NEVER OWN
THIS HOTEL.

21:24.233 --> 21:26.000
AND I'LL NEVER
BE THE PRESIDENT.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.500
AND I'LL NEVER WIN
THE NOBEL PRIZE.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.300
I'LL NEVER
MARRY MADDIE.

21:31.300 --> 21:34.300
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
I'M STILL RICH.

21:34.300 --> 21:36.100
YAY ME!

21:36.100 --> 21:39.600
YEAH, AND MY GLUE
WILL NEVER WORK.

21:39.600 --> 21:42.600
OHH!
IT GROWS HAIR.

21:42.600 --> 21:46.233
IT GROWS HAIR!
I'M RICH!

21:46.233 --> 21:47.667
I'M RICH!

21:47.667 --> 21:49.500

21:49.500 --> 21:52.133
I'M RICH!
I'M RICH!

21:52.133 --> 21:53.867
HA HA HA!

21:53.867 --> 21:55.834
[EXPLOSION]

21:55.834 --> 21:59.033
Arwin: NEVER MIND!
