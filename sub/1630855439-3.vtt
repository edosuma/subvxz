WEBVTT

00:17.234 --> 00:18.714
[Livia]
Your adopted son Iullus

00:18.844 --> 00:20.498
has been intimate with Julia,

00:20.629 --> 00:23.197
during and after
her marriage to Marcellus.

00:23.327 --> 00:24.502
You threw us to the wolves.

00:24.633 --> 00:26.809
[Livia] They threw you back.

00:26.939 --> 00:28.332
[Octavia] Marcellus!

00:28.463 --> 00:30.508
Livia and Tycho--
they killed my son.

00:30.639 --> 00:31.553
[Agrippa]
There's never been any proof

00:31.683 --> 00:33.033
that Livia was involved!

00:33.163 --> 00:35.731
And I wonder
just how hard you looked!

00:35.861 --> 00:37.820
-What the fuck?
-Oh, yes, Agrippa!

00:37.950 --> 00:40.866
I've seen the way
you look at Livia!

00:40.997 --> 00:43.347
[Antonia]
Whatever you think Livia did,

00:43.478 --> 00:45.523
it's wrong to punish
my sister or Drusus.

00:45.654 --> 00:47.395
-Will you be quiet?
-[Domitius] Yes.

00:47.525 --> 00:49.701
Keep your mouth shut.

00:49.832 --> 00:51.225
I sometimes wonder

00:51.355 --> 00:52.226
if you understand
the risk we're running.

00:52.356 --> 00:55.185
Of course I do.
But I don't care.

00:55.316 --> 00:58.362
[Livia] Someone very smart
was behind the famine,

00:58.493 --> 01:00.060
behind the grain prefects.

01:00.190 --> 01:01.844
He will have to be found...

01:01.974 --> 01:03.237
quietly.

01:03.367 --> 01:05.194
[Gemina] I think I'm pregnant.

01:05.325 --> 01:06.588
[Scribonia]
Well, that's perfect!

01:06.718 --> 01:08.242
Do exactly what I tell you,

01:08.372 --> 01:10.679
and you'll get
everything you want.

01:12.028 --> 01:13.508
[Piso] You swore an oath

01:13.638 --> 01:17.338
to restore the Republic
after Augustus dies.

01:17.468 --> 01:18.861
If he ever sees you
as a threat,

01:18.991 --> 01:20.689
you'll be dead.

01:20.819 --> 01:22.212
[Drusus] You can't take Rome
without an army behind you,

01:22.343 --> 01:24.214
and the biggest one
is on the German border.

01:24.345 --> 01:26.390
Make me general
of the Rhine Army.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.175
Send me to war.

01:34.223 --> 01:35.399
[suspenseful music playing]

01:35.530 --> 01:38.446
[man groaning]

01:45.322 --> 01:48.282
[shackles clanking]

01:58.205 --> 02:00.555
And you?

02:00.685 --> 02:02.731
It has to be a boy.

02:09.738 --> 02:10.913
[witch doctor] It will be.

02:17.049 --> 02:21.445
[man screams in pain]

02:21.576 --> 02:24.492
[screaming]

02:29.714 --> 02:33.457
[indistinct conversations]

02:33.588 --> 02:37.287
Carmenta,
great goddess of childbirth,

02:37.418 --> 02:40.290
it's me, Livia,
daughter of Marcus Livius.

02:40.421 --> 02:42.640
Please accept this gift.

02:42.771 --> 02:45.774
In return,
spare the life of Julia

02:45.904 --> 02:48.951
and let her child be born safe.

02:51.432 --> 02:55.175
But not another boy.

02:55.305 --> 02:56.263
And if you send her a girl,

02:56.393 --> 02:58.265
I will thank you
with a baby goat.

03:01.398 --> 03:04.271
[screaming]

03:04.401 --> 03:06.316
[midwife]
Yes, you're doing really well.

03:06.447 --> 03:08.449
It should've been easier
the third time.

03:08.579 --> 03:10.494
-[midwife] That's it!
-Push, Julia.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.844
-[Julia screaming]
-Light more lamps, now! Go!

03:12.975 --> 03:14.977
They call the child
out into the light.

03:15.107 --> 03:18.459
[Julia screaming]

03:18.589 --> 03:21.244
-Right.
-You'll be fine.

03:21.375 --> 03:24.987
That's what Metella thought,
and Lucia and Rufilla.

03:25.117 --> 03:28.120
And they're all dead,
and so are their babies.

03:28.251 --> 03:29.731
[groans]

03:29.861 --> 03:31.559
[indistinct conversations]

03:38.609 --> 03:39.871
Turia!

03:40.002 --> 03:42.004
I'm on official business
for the Temple of Vesta.

03:42.134 --> 03:43.701
My husband is the First Citizen.

03:43.832 --> 03:45.007
[Turia] And don't we know it?

03:45.137 --> 03:47.749
-Back up, now.
-You back up.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.363
Not for you, Livia Drusilla.

03:53.494 --> 03:54.712
[Livia] You really
want to do this, huh?

03:54.843 --> 03:57.367
-[Gemina] Turn around.
-You wouldn't dare.

03:57.498 --> 03:58.847
[Turia] Oh!

03:58.977 --> 04:00.849
My person is sacrosanct!

04:00.979 --> 04:02.938
Sue me.

04:05.723 --> 04:08.509
[suspenseful music playing]

04:12.382 --> 04:14.819
Don't move. Ever.

04:17.735 --> 04:22.174
[crowd clamoring]

04:31.749 --> 04:33.229
[Gemina]
Be here in one hour.

04:36.580 --> 04:40.062
[theme music playing]

05:32.636 --> 05:34.508
[Drusus] That's Germany.

05:34.638 --> 05:37.249
This is the main pass
through the Alps

05:37.380 --> 05:39.164
the tribes keep cutting off.

05:39.295 --> 05:42.777
They wait in the trees there
and pour down on our transports.

05:42.907 --> 05:46.128
They steal everything
and kill everyone.

05:46.258 --> 05:49.610
So what's the plan?

05:49.740 --> 05:51.612
Well, we'll send scouts
up into the woods

05:51.742 --> 05:53.308
to reconnoiter and report back,

05:53.440 --> 05:57.139
then we'll discuss our options,
formulate a battle plan.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.358
Seriously?

05:58.488 --> 06:01.796
Why? What did you have in mind?

06:01.926 --> 06:03.972
I'd mass in the valley
overnight,

06:04.102 --> 06:05.495
then attack at dawn.

06:05.626 --> 06:06.801
Clear the woods,

06:06.931 --> 06:09.020
drive the tribes
back to their villages,

06:09.151 --> 06:11.980
then burn them flat.

06:12.110 --> 06:14.374
Sounds good to me.

06:14.504 --> 06:17.289
Let's get breakfast.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.076
[horse whinnies in background]

06:21.206 --> 06:23.339
[man] Right,
you take his legs.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.473
We're attacking at dawn.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.692
What?

06:28.823 --> 06:29.867
[Drusus]
If you can't believe it,

06:29.998 --> 06:32.043
imagine the enemy's surprise.

06:32.174 --> 06:34.002
Yes. I feel sorry for them.

06:34.132 --> 06:35.482
[Antonina] Who?

06:35.612 --> 06:37.353
[Vipsania] Everyone in a war.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.877
It's such
a futile waste of life,

06:40.008 --> 06:43.011
cloaked in lies
like "honor" and "glory,"

06:43.141 --> 06:45.056
which simply hides its venality

06:45.187 --> 06:47.189
from those who are
forced to endure it

06:47.319 --> 06:48.756
for the benefit
of those who aren't.

06:52.716 --> 06:55.197
-Is that the letter from Mother?
-[Tiberius] Yes.

06:55.327 --> 06:56.416
Julia's pregnancy's going well.

06:56.546 --> 06:58.200
Everyone's doing
what they're told,

06:58.330 --> 07:00.420
and everything's under control.

07:00.550 --> 07:01.725
Don't know why she bothered
putting it in code.

07:01.856 --> 07:04.598
Habit, I suppose.

07:04.728 --> 07:08.253
[Tiberius] Mm, I think
she craves the drama.

07:08.384 --> 07:11.387
Mother's happy.
That's all that matters.

07:11.518 --> 07:12.997
[chuckles]

07:16.087 --> 07:17.698
[Tycho] What's happened?

07:17.828 --> 07:20.962
That German slave Drusus had,

07:21.092 --> 07:22.354
-Gemina...
-[Tycho] Yeah?

07:22.485 --> 07:23.791
What did you do with her?

07:23.921 --> 07:25.706
She was sold
in the slave market at Sutrium

07:25.836 --> 07:26.881
with fake ownership documents...

07:27.011 --> 07:28.578
-[Livia] Mm.
-As you asked.

07:28.709 --> 07:30.101
Who bought her?

07:30.232 --> 07:32.364
[scoffs] A fat man.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.628
You didn't find out?

07:34.758 --> 07:37.805
No. I followed them
to a whorehouse in the town

07:37.935 --> 07:39.067
and assumed he was the owner.

07:39.197 --> 07:41.896
So you didn't check?

07:42.026 --> 07:44.464
Slaves get bought and sold.

07:44.594 --> 07:45.987
If you'd wanted her watched
for the rest of her life,

07:46.117 --> 07:47.205
you should've just said.

07:47.336 --> 07:49.817
Shit.

07:49.947 --> 07:52.384
I was careless.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.648
She's back. In Rome.

07:54.778 --> 07:57.346
-Are you sure?
-I just saw her!

07:57.477 --> 08:00.131
With her own slaves, a litter,
and a fucking apartment!

08:00.262 --> 08:01.785
She must have got in touch
with Drusus somehow.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.918
[Livia]
That's what I'm afraid of.

08:04.048 --> 08:05.485
Find out who owns the apartment.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.574
If Gaius ever finds out...

08:07.704 --> 08:09.967
[Tycho]
Just give me the address.

08:10.098 --> 08:12.317
[Antonia] Come on, big push.

08:12.448 --> 08:13.797
-Last push.
-[Julia screaming]

08:13.928 --> 08:15.451
-[Antonia] Come on, Julia.
-Come on, that's it.

08:15.582 --> 08:19.194
[screaming]

08:19.324 --> 08:21.152
[Antonia] Yes, you did it!
You did it! You did it!

08:21.283 --> 08:23.807
[Julia crying]

08:23.938 --> 08:25.679
[Julia] It's dead, isn't it?

08:29.465 --> 08:31.598
It was a boy.

08:31.728 --> 08:35.863
You're alive,
and that's what matters.

08:49.267 --> 08:53.837
I wish we could go somewhere,

08:53.968 --> 08:56.840
together,

08:56.971 --> 09:00.670
away from Rome.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.629
Or back to Germany.

09:04.935 --> 09:07.329
We could inspect the troops.

09:07.459 --> 09:10.027
[chuckles]

09:10.158 --> 09:12.508
I could show you
where I come from.

09:15.511 --> 09:17.600
The snowy mountains.

09:21.648 --> 09:22.997
I miss the mountains.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.958
Do you want to go home?

09:30.961 --> 09:33.573
My home is gone.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.618
Everything's gone.

09:43.147 --> 09:44.888
[sighs]

09:45.019 --> 09:47.151
I can't stay long today.

09:48.849 --> 09:51.286
My daughter's giving birth.

10:01.818 --> 10:02.819
Gaius?

10:04.691 --> 10:08.042
I'm also pregnant.

10:08.172 --> 10:09.260
With your child!

10:09.391 --> 10:12.046
And it's a boy.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.135
I found a German priest here,

10:14.265 --> 10:16.616
of my own tribe, to make sure.

10:16.746 --> 10:19.967
If you give our gods
the right sacrifice,

10:20.097 --> 10:22.143
they give you a boy in return.

10:28.062 --> 10:31.500
Aren't you happy?

10:34.721 --> 10:36.592
I will free you,

10:36.723 --> 10:38.246
formally,

10:38.376 --> 10:40.944
give you a dowry,
find you a husband.

10:41.075 --> 10:44.644
Your son will be born a citizen.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.602
Ourson.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.082
You'll move to
a small town somewhere.

10:48.212 --> 10:51.999
-[scoffs] What?
-I grew up in one myself.

10:52.129 --> 10:54.915
It's not so bad.

10:58.266 --> 11:06.013
I have done everything
you asked of me.

11:06.143 --> 11:08.319
I have been a prisoner

11:08.450 --> 11:11.932
in this fucking place!

11:12.062 --> 11:14.499
And now,

11:14.630 --> 11:17.502
when I give you a son,

11:17.633 --> 11:20.941
you send me away!
She never gave you a son!

11:21.071 --> 11:23.117
[screams]

11:23.247 --> 11:25.815
[screams]

11:25.946 --> 11:28.252
[grunts]

11:28.383 --> 11:32.126
Aah!

11:32.256 --> 11:35.912
I am the daughter of a king.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.658
You'll be taken care of.

11:42.789 --> 11:45.661
[dramatic music playing]

11:48.359 --> 11:51.232
[indistinct conversations]

11:53.103 --> 11:54.801
[suspenseful music playing]

12:01.590 --> 12:04.332
[sighs]

12:16.344 --> 12:19.521
-I'm sorry, Agrippa.
-No...

12:19.651 --> 12:21.175
As long as you're all right.

12:26.702 --> 12:29.052
Don't tell my father,
not yet.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.662
[man] Of course you can see her.
This way.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.277
[sighs]

12:39.889 --> 12:42.457
I couldn't help it.

12:46.287 --> 12:47.549
Don't worry.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.812
You'll be pregnant again
in no time.

12:54.904 --> 12:59.256
Antonia, my daughter,
three births in four years.

12:59.387 --> 13:03.260
You and Vipsania--
not pregnant once.

13:03.391 --> 13:04.566
I need my family
to set an example.

13:04.696 --> 13:08.222
She will.

13:08.352 --> 13:10.311
Something's come up.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.449
How long have you
been keeping her?

13:18.580 --> 13:20.843
Nearly a year.

13:20.974 --> 13:24.281
You're the guardian
of the public fucking morals.

13:24.412 --> 13:25.805
You made yourself that.
What were you thinking?

13:25.935 --> 13:28.677
Fucking a slave doesn't count.
Everyone knows that.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.592
Everyone isn't telling
everyone else to get married

13:30.722 --> 13:33.116
and have children
with their wives.

13:33.247 --> 13:34.814
And everyone else
isn't married to Livia.

13:34.944 --> 13:36.816
Seriously, what the fuck
were you thinking?!

13:36.946 --> 13:41.298
-I just wanted her.
-So did Drusus.

13:41.429 --> 13:44.084
[dog barking,
horse whinnying in background]

13:46.695 --> 13:49.785
All right, what do you need?

13:49.915 --> 13:51.918
A decent husband.

13:52.048 --> 13:54.703
Someone who won't
ask questions, and fast.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.313
Maybe a family connection
of yours,

13:56.444 --> 13:58.359
somewhere out of Rome.
I can't be involved.

13:58.489 --> 14:00.840
Can we trust this woman
to keep her mouth shut?

14:00.970 --> 14:02.276
-Because if this gets out...
-It won't get out!

14:02.406 --> 14:03.843
Are you sure?

14:03.973 --> 14:05.496
Because you didn't
get where you are, brother,

14:05.627 --> 14:08.848
by being sentimental.

14:08.978 --> 14:10.806
She is a threat
to your authority

14:10.937 --> 14:12.373
and your marriage.

14:12.503 --> 14:15.158

29:58.927 --> 30:01.756
[chuckles]
No men, no Rome, no babies.

30:01.887 --> 30:06.543
I wish
we could stay here forever.

30:06.674 --> 30:08.415
I wish my husband were dead.

30:08.545 --> 30:14.290
I know, but I don't know why.

30:14.421 --> 30:19.121
No. Nobody does.
And Mother adores him.

30:19.252 --> 30:24.126
And Marcella,
and she hates everyone.

30:24.257 --> 30:28.914
He's the coldest thing
I've ever touched.

30:29.044 --> 30:30.480
And now he hates me

30:30.611 --> 30:33.657
because I can't get pregnant.
[sobs]

30:33.788 --> 30:36.617
My... my father
chose him specially.

30:36.747 --> 30:38.140
His family's important.

30:38.271 --> 30:42.841
-You'll never get a divorce.
-I know.

30:42.971 --> 30:48.455
-But...
-But what?

30:48.585 --> 30:52.198
Well, he might die.

30:52.328 --> 30:56.637
People do. Marcellus did.

30:56.767 --> 30:58.900
Antonia,
what the fuck are you saying?

31:04.427 --> 31:05.472
[Julia] Oh, look, here's Iullus.

31:12.827 --> 31:16.396
Your sister
can't give me children.

31:16.526 --> 31:18.659
[Marcella] Divorce her.

31:18.789 --> 31:21.314
She's the niece of Augustus.
I can't.

31:21.444 --> 31:25.666
You've never got me pregnant.

31:25.796 --> 31:28.234
And even Iullus
managed that once.

31:28.364 --> 31:32.499
You clean yourself afterwards
with lemon juice.

31:32.629 --> 31:35.545
I'm just saying.

31:35.676 --> 31:37.547
Not that I'm complaining.

31:37.678 --> 31:40.028
I haven't slept
with Iullus in years.

31:40.159 --> 31:43.858
I'd have a hard time
explaining a baby.

31:43.989 --> 31:47.993
[gasps]

31:48.123 --> 31:51.387
That happened to my mother.

31:51.518 --> 31:53.085
She had to take her own life.

31:53.215 --> 31:56.436
[tense music playing]

32:02.790 --> 32:03.965
This came for you earlier.

32:08.317 --> 32:09.797
So what are we doing
about the girl?

32:18.240 --> 32:21.069
This is from her.

32:21.200 --> 32:24.768
I am summoned.

32:24.899 --> 32:28.772
But why now?
I mean, does she know I know?

32:28.903 --> 32:33.299
"Important developments...
Things you need to know."

32:33.429 --> 32:35.301
No. It's impossible.

32:35.431 --> 32:38.739
-Look, don't go.
-Oh, I'm going.

32:38.869 --> 32:41.089
-It's a mistake.
-But not mine.

32:41.220 --> 32:42.395
[sighs]

32:46.529 --> 32:49.141
[man] Yes, everything's set.

32:49.271 --> 32:51.534
One moment.

32:53.406 --> 32:55.625
All right,
I've found her a husband.

32:55.756 --> 32:58.933
Small estate up the Tiber,
lost his wife last year.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.587
He'll take
some of my land nearby

33:00.717 --> 33:02.110
for the dowry.

33:02.241 --> 33:04.112
I have to free her first,

33:04.243 --> 33:06.288
and I need you
to be the witness.

33:06.419 --> 33:08.987
The sooner the better.

33:37.493 --> 33:42.629
Well... That was easy.

33:45.458 --> 33:47.112
It's just you and me.

33:47.242 --> 33:52.160
I did all the decoration myself.

33:52.291 --> 33:55.163
I had plenty of time
on my hands...

33:55.294 --> 33:57.992
when I wasn't fucking
your husband.

34:01.604 --> 34:05.043
I was a child,

34:05.173 --> 34:08.306
stolen from my family, raped,

34:08.437 --> 34:11.353
brought to your country
as a slave.

34:11.484 --> 34:12.702
[sighs heavily]

34:12.833 --> 34:16.184
Do you know what happens
to you then?

34:16.315 --> 34:19.056
Do you care?

34:19.187 --> 34:23.016
And then I found Drusus,
and I loved him,

34:23.148 --> 34:27.543
and he loved me,
and he freed me.

34:27.674 --> 34:32.199
And then you came,
and you sold me off like a dog.

34:32.331 --> 34:36.378
Hmm.

34:36.509 --> 34:41.556
[laughs] But now I am pregnant

34:41.688 --> 34:44.952
with your husband's son.

34:48.695 --> 34:51.871
So it is time for you
to move aside...

34:52.002 --> 34:53.830
permanently.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.276
[screams]

35:04.406 --> 35:06.060
[Gemina yells]

35:06.191 --> 35:09.368
[both screaming]

35:09.498 --> 35:16.244
[grunts]

35:16.375 --> 35:22.555
[panting]

35:31.216 --> 35:33.392
[Livia coughs]

35:49.059 --> 35:52.019
[Gemina choking]

35:54.064 --> 35:55.240
[knife clatters]

35:55.370 --> 35:57.067
No!

35:59.418 --> 36:03.073
[panting]

36:10.255 --> 36:12.257
[grunts]

36:20.787 --> 36:23.137
[Julia] She wants
to kill her husband.

36:23.268 --> 36:27.663
-Antonia?
-Yes, Antonia.

36:27.794 --> 36:30.100
The only kind
and truly decent person

36:30.231 --> 36:32.538
in this whole stinking family.

36:32.668 --> 36:34.975
We got to her in the end.

36:35.105 --> 36:37.499
Any particular reason?

36:37.630 --> 36:43.026
She won't tell me everything,
but he scares her.

36:43.157 --> 36:45.899
And, of course,
she can't divorce him.

36:46.029 --> 36:49.816
She's trapped,
just like I was with Marcellus.

36:56.344 --> 36:58.825
If you think about it,

36:58.955 --> 37:01.175
Domitius is your direct rival

37:01.306 --> 37:04.222
for any kind of power
after my father dies.

37:04.352 --> 37:08.182
And we've learned
we can't rely on Livia.

37:12.317 --> 37:15.058
Your father
wouldn't have hesitated.

37:15.189 --> 37:16.712
Mine never did.

37:16.843 --> 37:18.671
[Antonia] All right?

37:18.801 --> 37:21.543
[sighs]

37:21.674 --> 37:29.856
[both chuckle]

37:29.986 --> 37:32.859
Gemina?

37:32.989 --> 37:34.600
Gaius.

37:45.132 --> 37:47.047
Brother.

37:59.581 --> 38:02.105
Oh, don't look at me, brother.

38:02.236 --> 38:03.716
You said no,
and that was the end of it.

38:16.381 --> 38:20.298
Get this place
cleaned up, brother.

38:20.428 --> 38:22.822
And find out who did this.

38:22.952 --> 38:25.825
Whatever it takes.

38:28.915 --> 38:31.178
[door opens, closes]

38:36.270 --> 38:39.012
[horse whinnies in distance,
hooves clopping]

38:56.246 --> 38:57.639
Oh, fuck.

38:57.770 --> 38:59.598
[gasps]

39:04.211 --> 39:06.779
Hey.

39:06.909 --> 39:08.955
Where am I?

39:09.085 --> 39:12.350
My house in Rome.

39:12.480 --> 39:16.136
[Livia breathing heavily]

39:16.266 --> 39:21.620
You didn't come out,
so I went in.

39:21.750 --> 39:24.971
It's a deep wound, but clean.

39:25.101 --> 39:26.712
Antigone would be happy.

39:30.455 --> 39:33.806
-Tycho...
-What?

39:33.936 --> 39:37.810
My bracelet...

39:44.425 --> 39:50.300
[dog barking in distance]

39:53.956 --> 39:56.829
He needs to speak with you.

40:04.140 --> 40:07.796
You all right?

40:43.963 --> 40:45.399
Thank you.

40:52.537 --> 40:54.887
She tried to kill me.

40:55.017 --> 40:58.064
Well, people keep making
that mistake.

41:02.416 --> 41:07.769
Gaius asked me
to find out who did it

41:07.900 --> 41:09.641
and bring him their head,

41:09.771 --> 41:12.644
and I always do what he asks...

41:12.774 --> 41:16.256
without exception.

41:16.386 --> 41:19.651
Ever.

41:19.781 --> 41:25.091
-I have never betrayed him.
-I know.

41:25.221 --> 41:27.310
But I have always loved you.

41:27.441 --> 41:32.228
I know that, too.

41:36.581 --> 41:41.803
So... My son.

41:41.934 --> 41:46.765
I want Gaius to adopt him,
formally, to secure his future.

41:50.159 --> 41:55.643
And I know I need your support
for something like that.

41:55.774 --> 42:00.996
That's the price
of your silence?

42:01.127 --> 42:04.173
Well, I wouldn't have put it
quite so boldly.

42:04.304 --> 42:08.134
I would have done that
for nothing.

42:08.264 --> 42:10.440
[chuckles]

42:26.979 --> 42:29.155
[breathes deeply]

42:48.174 --> 42:50.524
[grunts] Tycho.

42:50.655 --> 42:53.179
[clears throat]

42:53.309 --> 42:56.095
-Tycho!
-What?

42:56.225 --> 42:58.619
My marriage is broken,

42:58.750 --> 43:02.667
and I didn't know how to fix it,
but now I do.

43:02.797 --> 43:05.844
I have to tell Gaius everything.

43:09.630 --> 43:12.677
And I need your permission

43:12.807 --> 43:14.635
because your life
might depend on it, too.

43:18.204 --> 43:21.381
Are you sure about this?

43:21.511 --> 43:24.253
It's a risk.

43:24.384 --> 43:28.693
But the one thing Gaius hates
is weakness,

43:28.823 --> 43:31.739
and I've been weak too long.

43:31.870 --> 43:35.613
All right.

43:35.743 --> 43:38.920
Get a message to Gaius now,
and then...

43:39.051 --> 43:40.269
you need to leave Rome,

43:40.400 --> 43:43.882
just in case.

43:45.753 --> 43:48.451
Go to Egypt, Alexandria.

43:48.582 --> 43:50.758
It's time we found out
who was behind the famine.

43:50.889 --> 43:56.242
Then the conspiracy
would have started there.

43:56.372 --> 44:00.638
Hey... Be careful.

44:04.380 --> 44:06.426
Look after my daughter.

44:08.210 --> 44:10.648
Always.

44:17.742 --> 44:20.832
[laughs]

44:22.703 --> 44:24.879
[horse whinnies]

44:25.010 --> 44:28.448
Oh!

44:28.578 --> 44:30.450
Don't forget me.

44:30.580 --> 44:34.933
Okay?

45:52.662 --> 45:54.186
Does it hurt?

45:57.189 --> 46:00.496
Oh, how it hurts.

46:03.673 --> 46:06.285
You betrayed me, my love.

46:08.417 --> 46:11.116
And you almost got me killed.

46:19.689 --> 46:22.214
So, now maybe we're even.

46:26.914 --> 46:29.221
I'm sorry
about Marcellus, Gaius.

46:29.351 --> 46:30.875
I really am.

46:33.051 --> 46:35.880
And I'm sorry
it came back on you.

46:39.013 --> 46:41.407
I had no choice.

46:41.537 --> 46:44.976
You could have come to me.

46:45.106 --> 46:47.630
And said what?

46:47.761 --> 46:51.199
"Don't get sick. Don't get old.

46:51.330 --> 46:54.899
Live forever so you can save me
from Marcellus and his friends."

46:55.029 --> 46:56.770
Even you weren't safe from them.

47:00.600 --> 47:03.298
-Octavia.
-I know.

47:03.429 --> 47:08.086
That is my burden. I bear it.

47:16.572 --> 47:18.923
So where do we go from here?

47:19.053 --> 47:23.666
Where we were always going...

47:23.797 --> 47:26.278
to make you a god.

47:29.803 --> 47:35.287
And what about you?
Do you want to be a goddess?

47:35.417 --> 47:37.158
Well, you know,
if the offer comes in,

47:37.289 --> 47:39.726
obviously I will consider it.

47:41.293 --> 47:43.599
[chuckles softly]

48:08.320 --> 48:09.974
You should rest.

48:18.634 --> 48:20.767

[panting]

48:52.668 --> 48:55.889
Ha!

48:56.020 --> 48:57.891
I should have been a gladiator!

49:00.372 --> 49:03.592
A noble
and straightforward occupation.

49:03.723 --> 49:06.769
No fucking politics.

49:06.900 --> 49:08.467
Everyone's always
trying to kill you.

49:08.597 --> 49:10.077
Ah, but at least you know that.

49:10.208 --> 49:13.863

[grunts]

49:16.475 --> 49:19.739
[gurgling]

49:19.869 --> 49:22.568
Livia killed the girl.

49:22.698 --> 49:24.657
She told me.

49:33.231 --> 49:36.408
[swords clanking,
men grunting]

49:40.107 --> 49:42.414
And Marcellus.

49:45.286 --> 49:46.766
She admitted it?

49:54.600 --> 49:57.646
Well, she did
what was necessary, brother.

49:57.777 --> 50:03.652
She always does.
What you should have done.

50:03.783 --> 50:05.915
I never cared
that she killed Marcellus.

50:07.874 --> 50:11.573
I care that she got caught.

50:23.107 --> 50:26.240
I need you to do
something for me.

50:30.288 --> 50:34.335
Don't do it.

50:34.466 --> 50:38.557
Whatever it is, don't do it.

50:42.126 --> 50:44.998
[birds calling]

50:45.129 --> 50:48.001
[dramatic music playing]

[horse whinnies]

51:04.278 --> 51:05.323
[whinnying continues]

51:33.612 --> 51:35.266
Divorce?

51:40.358 --> 51:42.708
Exile.

51:47.887 --> 51:50.542
Unofficial,

51:50.672 --> 51:55.416
and it's to stay between
the three of us.

51:55.547 --> 51:57.114
How long?

52:03.424 --> 52:07.733
I'll take care of the boys
until you get back.

52:43.290 --> 52:46.163
We still have
our deal though, right?

52:46.293 --> 52:49.905
Fuck off. [laughs]

53:03.658 --> 53:05.747
Is that from Mother?

53:07.923 --> 53:09.621
It's from Piso.

53:11.144 --> 53:15.366
It's Mother. She's fallen.

53:15.496 --> 53:17.194
She's been exiled.

53:17.324 --> 53:20.197
Exiled? For what?

53:20.327 --> 53:21.807
He doesn't say.

53:33.122 --> 53:36.778
Well, that's it then.
It's all over.

53:36.909 --> 53:37.953
What is?

53:38.084 --> 53:40.260
Nothing.

53:41.957 --> 53:43.829
Everything.

53:46.440 --> 53:50.227
[grunts]

54:23.521 --> 54:26.350
She's not dead.

54:26.480 --> 54:30.267
She might as well be.

54:30.397 --> 54:32.399
Can you imagine Mother

54:32.530 --> 54:35.707
stuck out
