Logan?

01:23.548 --> 01:25.506
Logan, where are you?

01:27.548 --> 01:30.840
- Logan!
- Oh, fuck.

Where am I?

01:32.548 --> 01:34.049
It's OK.

We're in the new place.

- This is it.

02:20.965 --> 02:23.381
This is the day
we make it happen, Fikret.

02:23.465 --> 02:24.882
You're the man, Mr. Roy.

You're the man.

Jesus Christ.

04:35.423 --> 04:37.757
Hey, hey, hey, buddy.

04:37.840 --> 04:38.882
Good to see you.

04:38.965 --> 04:42.715
So, are we ready
to fuck or what?

04:42.798 --> 04:45.090
Yeah... OK.

04:45.174 --> 04:47.215
Look, I-I'm really sorry,

04:47.299 --> 04:50.132
but it looks like
there's an issue.

04:50.215 --> 04:53.007
Come on, I came
all the way up here, dude.

04:53.090 --> 04:55.506
Yeah, I'm sorry..

04:55.590 --> 04:57.506
uh, dude.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.465
OK.

05:01.548 --> 05:04.590
Listen, you know I love
what you do, right?

05:04.673 --> 05:07.715
I'd love to keep
you and your team
in place, Lawrence.

05:07.798 --> 05:09.715
I think Vaulter is the shiz.

05:09.798 --> 05:12.007
We're the shiz?

05:12.090 --> 05:12.923
Yeah.

05:13.007 --> 05:14.840
What's it gonna take?

05:14.923 --> 05:17.798
You want me to send
a vintage Jaguar
over to your house today?

05:17.882 --> 05:18.798
I'll do it.

05:20.465 --> 05:23.340
Um, s-sure. Look, um...

05:23.423 --> 05:25.049
I just think bottom line,

05:25.132 --> 05:28.506
I can deliver a lot more value
for our shareholders.

05:28.590 --> 05:31.590
I hope we haven't
inconvenienced you.

05:31.673 --> 05:34.882
I see you.
I see this.

05:34.965 --> 05:38.798
We appreciate your interest
in our little outfit,

05:38.882 --> 05:41.506
but I think that's it.

05:43.257 --> 05:45.257
Come on. That's it?

05:45.340 --> 05:48.381
That's not it.
What the fuck happened?

05:50.590 --> 05:52.506
Yo, hang on.

05:54.757 --> 05:56.049
Hold up, hold up.

06:01.215 --> 06:03.965
I'm not letting
you Neanderthals in
to rape my company.

06:04.049 --> 06:05.174
Ever.

06:05.257 --> 06:06.340
I'm sorry?

06:06.423 --> 06:08.340
You're a bunch
of bloated dinosaurs

06:08.423 --> 06:10.882
who didn't even notice
the monkeys swinging by
till yesterday.

06:10.965 --> 06:12.673
Well, fuck you,
daddy's boy.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.548
Hey, come on.
Don't blow this up.

06:16.631 --> 06:18.673
I got a track record
from founding

06:18.757 --> 06:21.923
one of the most exciting
new media brands in the world.

06:22.007 --> 06:26.340
And what do you got?
Track marks from shooting junk?

06:26.423 --> 06:28.631
Thanks for coming down.
It was great to meet you.

06:28.715 --> 06:31.673
Sorry this isn't
going to work out.

06:31.757 --> 06:33.506
No, it's gonna work out.

06:35.340 --> 06:37.840
No, it isn't.

06:44.548 --> 06:46.049
Take care, dude.

06:50.506 --> 06:53.257
Fuck. What the fuck, Frank?

06:53.340 --> 06:54.631
I--

06:54.715 --> 06:56.090
How can we salvage this?

06:56.174 --> 06:57.174
You still want
to pursue this?

06:57.257 --> 06:58.381
Yeah, of course I wanna pursue.

06:58.465 --> 06:59.631
I wanna announce.

06:59.715 --> 07:00.631
This is part
of the whole thing.

07:00.715 --> 07:01.631
This is the secret sauce.

07:01.715 --> 07:02.965
Do we need to sweeten the offer?

07:03.049 --> 07:04.923
You wanna bump the offer
another point?

07:06.590 --> 07:08.423
Do you wanna
call your dad?

07:08.506 --> 07:11.007
Do I wanna call my dad?

07:11.090 --> 07:13.257
No, I don't wanna call my dad.

07:14.548 --> 07:16.257
Do you wanna call your  dad?

07:17.590 --> 07:19.007
- No.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.132
Do you wanna
call your dad?

07:20.215 --> 07:21.506
Does anybody wanna
call their dad?

07:21.590 --> 07:23.631
OK, nobody wants to talk
to their fucking dad.

07:23.715 --> 07:26.923
So, we've started, so let's
buy this fucking company.

07:27.007 --> 07:28.631
I'm pushing the bid
to 120. OK?

07:28.715 --> 07:31.381
- OK.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.673
Logan:
How's it going?

07:38.757 --> 07:40.548
Yeah, I'm right
in the middle, Dad.

07:40.631 --> 07:41.757
Did you close?

07:41.840 --> 07:43.381
Kendall:
Yeah, it's OK.

07:43.465 --> 07:45.174
We're not quite closed.

07:45.257 --> 07:47.548
I'm going to 120.

07:51.423 --> 07:53.590
So, that's good.

07:53.673 --> 07:55.631
Uh...

07:55.715 --> 07:58.840
and are we still good
for the announcement?

07:58.923 --> 08:00.465
Uh-huh.

08:00.548 --> 08:03.299
Great, 'cause obviously
I'm soft floating

08:03.381 --> 08:05.215
to, like,
Frank and Rava,

08:05.299 --> 08:07.381
and there's gossip
getting soft floated.

08:07.465 --> 08:08.548
By who?

08:08.631 --> 08:10.798
Uh, by the ether.

08:10.882 --> 08:11.965
I don't know.

08:13.506 --> 08:16.340
Hey, hey, happy birthday,
you old geezer.

08:16.423 --> 08:17.715
Look, it's exciting.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.132
This is gonna be
great for you, Dad.

08:19.215 --> 08:22.506
Mm-hmm. I'm excited.

08:51.299 --> 08:53.299
Logan :
Waystar Royco is a family.

08:53.381 --> 08:56.590
A family that spans
four continents,

08:56.673 --> 08:59.423
50 countries,
three divisions:

08:59.506 --> 09:02.673
Entertainment,
News and Resorts.

09:02.757 --> 09:04.174
Working together

09:04.257 --> 09:06.465
to provide a net
that can hold the world,

09:06.548 --> 09:09.340
or catapult it forward

09:09.423 --> 09:11.215
to the next adventure!

09:11.299 --> 09:13.049
Joining Waystar Royco,
you're joining

09:13.132 --> 09:15.465
one of the most dynamic news
and entertainment companies

09:15.548 --> 09:16.798
in the world.

09:16.882 --> 09:17.757
Feel it!

09:19.174 --> 09:20.548
OK, how's everyone feeling?

09:20.631 --> 09:21.798
- Great!
- Great!

09:21.882 --> 09:22.840
Excellent!

09:22.923 --> 09:25.548
Hey. You in the room?

09:28.506 --> 09:30.465
OK. Well, let's go out
and give these kids

09:30.548 --> 09:32.423
the best day
of their lives, huh?

09:32.506 --> 09:34.132
Feel it!

09:34.215 --> 09:36.923
- Feel it!
- Feel it!

09:38.215 --> 09:39.715
Hi!

09:39.798 --> 09:41.715
Girl:
Hi, Doderick!

09:41.798 --> 09:43.965
Whoo ooh ooh!

09:44.049 --> 09:46.340
Woo woo woo woo woo!

09:46.423 --> 09:47.715
Hi!

09:47.798 --> 09:50.798
Good morning!

09:50.882 --> 09:51.840
It's Doderick!

09:51.923 --> 09:55.049
Whoo! It's me, Doderick!

09:55.132 --> 09:57.007
Hey, happy birthday!

09:57.090 --> 09:59.548
Don't pull on my tail!

09:59.631 --> 10:01.757
Don't hit Doderick!

10:01.840 --> 10:03.465
- Hey!

10:03.548 --> 10:04.715
Quit it!

10:04.798 --> 10:06.715
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:08.923 --> 10:11.673
Wait, OK. Please get off.

10:11.757 --> 10:13.174
Can you fuck off?

10:13.257 --> 10:15.423
Can you just get the fuck off?

10:20.923 --> 10:22.049
Boy: Ew!

10:22.132 --> 10:24.673
He's puking out of his eyes!

10:26.090 --> 10:27.715
Protein spill.

10:29.381 --> 10:32.257
OK, this way, this way.
Come on.

10:41.423 --> 10:42.506
Greg?

10:42.590 --> 10:44.840
Greg:
Hi, Mom.

10:44.923 --> 10:47.882
How
How's it going?

10:47.965 --> 10:50.631
Mom, sorry,
but I sort of screwed up.

10:50.715 --> 10:54.049
Well, not me, actually,
but this kid.

10:54.132 --> 10:55.299
Greg.

10:55.381 --> 10:57.882
So, this kid smoked a joint
in my car.

10:57.965 --> 10:59.132
A kid.

10:59.215 --> 11:01.548
Like this hitchhiker kid
that I

11:01.631 --> 11:03.215
picked up this morning,
like earlier this morning.

11:03.299 --> 11:05.840
'Cause it was raining
and I didn't want...

11:05.923 --> 11:08.548
I didn't want him
to get sexually assaulted?

11:08.631 --> 11:09.840
Greg.

11:09.923 --> 11:11.132
Before I could
even say anything...

11:11.215 --> 11:12.049
What the fuck?

11:12.132 --> 11:13.757
...aggressively takes out--

11:13.840 --> 11:16.757
Have you ever seen, like,
so, a doobie?

11:16.840 --> 11:19.423
And the car
smelled like skunk weed.

11:19.506 --> 11:21.090
And then I guess
I smelled like it.

11:21.174 --> 11:22.590
And then

11:22.673 --> 11:23.590
they were just like,

11:23.673 --> 11:25.465
"Get all your stuff and go."

11:25.548 --> 11:26.673
Greg.

11:26.757 --> 11:28.548
Did you even think
for one second

11:28.631 --> 11:29.715
to tell them who you are?

11:29.798 --> 11:30.798
No, I thought--

11:30.882 --> 11:32.257
I didn't wanna be an asshole

11:32.340 --> 11:33.506
or get into it all.

11:33.590 --> 11:34.798
- OK.
- I don't know.

11:34.882 --> 11:36.423
Here's what you're gonna do.

11:36.506 --> 11:38.299
You're gonna get a plane ticket
to New York.

11:38.381 --> 11:39.590
It's your Uncle--

11:39.673 --> 11:41.090
your Great-Uncle Logan's
birthday,

11:41.174 --> 11:42.798
and they're having a big party.

11:42.882 --> 11:44.631
I'll call Marcia
and tell her you're coming.

11:44.715 --> 11:45.840
It's his birthday?

11:45.923 --> 11:47.257
You're gonna go to the party.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.174
You're gonna get him
a nice gift.

11:49.257 --> 11:50.923
And you're gonna look nice.

11:51.007 --> 11:53.923
In a grown-up shirt
and a grown-up blazer.

11:54.007 --> 11:56.174
A blazer?

11:56.257 --> 11:58.423
Frank:
I'll let you know.

11:58.506 --> 12:01.174
They're not gonna budge unless
it gets to be a stupid number.

12:01.257 --> 12:02.757
What's a stupid number?

12:02.840 --> 12:04.757
What's stupid?
A "badillion"? I don't know.

12:04.840 --> 12:06.590
Because 120 is stupid.
Am I wrong?

12:06.673 --> 12:08.132
120 is a stupid number.

12:08.215 --> 12:09.798
But it's not really
a money thing right now.

12:09.882 --> 12:11.965
Woman: Mr. Roy,
someone's  here to see you.

12:13.715 --> 12:15.257
Yeah, hi.

12:15.340 --> 12:18.340
I was sent by Roman
to burn some sage.

12:18.423 --> 12:20.299
Excuse me?

12:20.381 --> 12:21.299
It's auspicious.

12:21.381 --> 12:23.423
I'm a business alchemist.

12:23.506 --> 12:25.215
It's a gift,
from your brother.

12:25.299 --> 12:26.965
Will it set off
the smoke alarms?

12:27.049 --> 12:27.965
Not usually.

12:28.049 --> 12:28.882
Not usually?

12:28.965 --> 12:31.673
Hey, hey, motherfuckers!

12:32.882 --> 12:34.798
- Roman.

12:34.882 --> 12:36.299
Are you saging?

12:36.381 --> 12:38.631
Frank: Well, we're concerned
about the alarms.

12:38.715 --> 12:40.465
Ooh, right, yeah,
the bad juju.

12:40.548 --> 12:42.923
Now, I can use essential oils.

12:43.007 --> 12:45.174
Oh, I think
just fuck off, thanks.

12:45.257 --> 12:46.798
How ya doing?

12:46.882 --> 12:49.506
Good. Good. Just finessing.

12:49.590 --> 12:52.506
Roman:
Mm. Finessing. Nice.

12:52.590 --> 12:54.090
Bye.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.506
He's good.

12:55.590 --> 12:57.215
You OK, man?

12:57.299 --> 13:00.465
OK? Yes, I'm OK. Obviously.

13:00.548 --> 13:01.798
Why would you even ask that?

13:01.882 --> 13:04.299
I don't know.
Just, you know.

13:04.381 --> 13:08.090
Here? Man, I'm so over it.
I was a bad fit.

13:08.174 --> 13:10.465
I was never a corporate
cock-suck anyway.

13:10.548 --> 13:12.757
Besides, I never made it this
high in the fucking building!

13:12.840 --> 13:15.174
They stuck me in LA
with Old Father Time right here.

13:15.257 --> 13:16.673
We were the pool boys,
right, Frank?

13:16.757 --> 13:17.882
Fuckin' banana cabana?

13:17.965 --> 13:20.506
- Good times.

13:20.590 --> 13:23.548
So, what's the bid?

13:23.631 --> 13:26.049
- Mm-hmm.

13:26.132 --> 13:27.423
Kendall: Well...

13:27.506 --> 13:31.049
What?
That's commercially sensitive?

13:31.132 --> 13:32.923
I'm still on the board, man.

13:33.007 --> 13:34.715
Kendall:
Going 125.

13:34.798 --> 13:36.506
One

13:36.590 --> 13:37.506
- Fuck!

13:37.590 --> 13:39.174
What

13:41.548 --> 13:43.049
- Yeah.

13:43.132 --> 13:45.340
Bit of content
and a brand name?

13:45.423 --> 13:47.548
Bit of content and a brand name
kinda's the whole game.

13:47.631 --> 13:48.965
- Mm-hmm.

13:50.590 --> 13:52.299
I don't know what
I'm talking about.

13:52.381 --> 13:53.882
You're gonna be
captain of the ship
soon enough.

13:53.965 --> 13:54.923
- So I don't--
- Shh.

13:55.007 --> 13:57.090
Oh, shit.

13:57.174 --> 13:59.923
Sorry. Fuck you, man.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.090
Every intern on the street
knows that you're stepping up.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.673
Seriously, congrats.

14:04.757 --> 14:06.132
I'm just so pleased
to be out of here.

14:06.215 --> 14:08.840
This place
was essentially a cage to me.

14:08.923 --> 14:10.882
I should take off. Fuck it.

14:10.965 --> 14:11.965
Hey, congrats, man.

14:12.049 --> 14:13.798
- Thanks for coming by.
- Mm-hmm.

14:13.882 --> 14:15.923
Mwah.

14:17.673 --> 14:21.381
Look at all this
fuckin' bullshit!

14:21.465 --> 14:24.381
Mm, yes, mm, very serious, mm.

14:26.049 --> 14:28.340
Love you, brother.

14:54.381 --> 14:56.506
Good.

14:58.257 --> 14:59.590
Right.

14:59.673 --> 15:02.049
Just keep everything
straight, OK?

15:04.548 --> 15:08.049
Good. ( Marcia continues,
indistinct )

15:15.923 --> 15:19.381
( Marcia continues
instructing wait staff )

15:22.590 --> 15:24.923
By the way, we need
another setting.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.381
Another family member
is coming.

15:34.673 --> 15:36.423
- Marcy.

15:36.506 --> 15:38.090
I'm heading out,

15:38.174 --> 15:39.840
as ordered.

15:39.923 --> 15:42.423
Great. Till 1:00--

15:42.506 --> 15:44.465
Fine. But in here, yeah?

15:44.548 --> 15:47.049
I don't want
a fuckin' heart attack
from the surprise.

15:47.132 --> 15:50.299
And I don't want anyone
in my face when I come out
of the elevator.

15:50.381 --> 15:51.965
Right. Distance.

15:52.049 --> 15:54.132
Have them here.
And, uh...

15:54.215 --> 15:56.840
Not too loud.

15:56.923 --> 16:01.049
Do you want me to email you
the exact details
of the surprise?

16:02.381 --> 16:03.257
Yeah?

16:04.548 --> 16:06.174
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

16:06.257 --> 16:07.715
Right. Get your coat.

16:07.798 --> 16:08.798
Yeah, yeah.

16:09.965 --> 16:11.757
Richard, get him his coat.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.381
Richard:
Of course.

16:13.465 --> 16:16.049
- Siobhan: Just double-check.
- Woman: OK.

16:16.132 --> 16:18.215
When were you
gonna look at that speech?

16:18.299 --> 16:21.007
I'll be back by Sunday night
so I'll look at his speech
with him then, OK?

16:21.090 --> 16:23.049
OK, but his office
wants the poll numbers
by the preekend.

16:23.132 --> 16:25.381
The "preekend"?
What the fuck's a "preekend"?

16:25.465 --> 16:26.715
Preekend is Friday.

16:26.798 --> 16:28.757
If he wants them by Friday,
can he not say Friday?

16:28.840 --> 16:31.215
Thursday lunch
through Friday afternoon
is the preekend.

16:31.299 --> 16:33.548
Oh, fine. Get Rennie
to look at the numbers.

16:33.631 --> 16:35.090
Shiv.

16:35.174 --> 16:36.590
This is
a fuckin' disaster.

16:36.673 --> 16:38.798
I got to
strategize my gift.

16:38.882 --> 16:40.715
What can I get him
he'll love?

16:40.798 --> 16:43.049
I don't know. My dad
doesn't really like things.

16:43.132 --> 16:44.257
He doesn't like things?

16:44.340 --> 16:45.590
No, not really.

16:45.673 --> 16:47.465
It needs to say
that "I respect you,

16:47.548 --> 16:48.882
but I'm not awed by you.

16:48.965 --> 16:50.965
And that I--
I like you,

16:51.049 --> 16:53.923
but I need you to like me
before I can love you."

16:54.007 --> 16:55.757
So what says that?

16:55.840 --> 16:57.423
Just, look, everything
that you get him

16:57.506 --> 16:59.465
will mean an equal amount
of nothing,

16:59.548 --> 17:01.757
so make sure it looks like
10 to 15 grand's worth
and you're good.

17:01.840 --> 17:02.923
Will you come in here
and help me?

17:03.007 --> 17:03.882
Yes.

17:03.965 --> 17:04.840
Please help me.

17:04.923 --> 17:06.923
Yes. Get him a watch.

17:07.007 --> 17:08.798
If we go stupid on the stock,

17:08.882 --> 17:12.299
what does a really sexy package
look like

17:12.381 --> 17:13.715
He's probably illiquid, right?

17:13.798 --> 17:16.257
So, what, we throw in
another ten million?

17:16.340 --> 17:18.423
Might need
to throw in a blow job, too.

17:18.506 --> 17:19.923
I'll throw in a blow job.

17:20.007 --> 17:22.423
I'll throw in a blow job.

17:22.506 --> 17:24.299
I'll throw in a reach-around.

17:24.381 --> 17:27.340
Hell, I'll even cup his balls.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.257
Dad.

17:30.381 --> 17:32.174
Frank:
I thought you'd be

17:32.257 --> 17:34.049
in St. Barts by now.

17:35.715 --> 17:38.090
- Kendall: Good.

17:38.174 --> 17:40.798
Uh, yeah.
Fine. Good.

17:40.882 --> 17:42.590
Uh, why are you...

17:44.049 --> 17:45.257
Are we OK?

17:45.340 --> 17:47.174
Yeah, it's just
some paperwork.

17:47.257 --> 17:48.798
What, ahead of
the announcement?

17:48.882 --> 17:53.465
Putting Marcy on the trust.
It's...bullshit.

17:53.548 --> 17:56.882
I, uh, I just felt
like checkin' in.

17:56.965 --> 17:58.715
Oh. Yeah, fine.

17:58.798 --> 18:01.506
- Yeah.

18:01.590 --> 18:03.423
Doesn't affect me stepping up?

18:03.506 --> 18:05.381
No, no, no, no, no.
I think I told you about it.

18:07.882 --> 18:09.215
Is that--

18:09.299 --> 18:11.757
Sorry, Dad, I'm kind of
in the middle of--

18:11.840 --> 18:14.548
Do you need--
Do I need to lawyer
all this?

18:14.631 --> 18:16.965
It's housekeeping.

18:24.340 --> 18:27.049
Fine. Yeah. Yeah.
Marcy's fine by me.

18:27.132 --> 18:32.381
I mean, the others
might not feel the same, but...

18:32.465 --> 18:33.590
I'll deal with that.

18:36.007 --> 18:41.132
So, I'll see you in...

18:41.215 --> 18:43.840
Yeah, look, Dad, on lunch.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.923
I really want to be with you,
but the deal--

18:47.007 --> 18:48.132
- Son.
- You know.

18:50.631 --> 18:52.381
It's your call.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.423
Just priorities.

18:54.506 --> 18:56.299
There'll be plenty more.

18:56.381 --> 18:58.923
Uh-oh. Wheat.

19:00.882 --> 19:02.715
Bye, Frank.

19:02.798 --> 19:04.423
Frank:
All right, amigo.

19:06.757 --> 19:10.590
I have five farms,
and underneath all my farms

19:10.673 --> 19:13.715
runs a big, giant aquifer
that's like an underground lake.

19:13.798 --> 19:16.007
- That's so cool!
- I have pumping rights.

19:16.090 --> 19:17.757
That means I get
to take the water.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.715
- That's so cool!
- And it's very important

19:19.798 --> 19:21.757
because someday
water's gonna be
more precious than gold

19:21.840 --> 19:23.840
and people
are gonna kill each other
to try to get that water.

19:23.923 --> 19:25.757
Oh, hey, hey,
Tom, don't, don't.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.965
- Don't listen to him.
- Right, right, sorry.

19:28.049 --> 19:29.548
But I'm gonna
have the water.

19:29.631 --> 19:30.715
And I'll share with you.

19:30.798 --> 19:33.590
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.798
- Good.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.882
- Good. You look great.

19:36.965 --> 19:39.882
- What a beautiful color.
- Thanks. Same.

19:39.965 --> 19:41.257
- Thank you.
- Love that.

19:41.340 --> 19:42.506
Thanks.

19:42.590 --> 19:44.381
- Hi, Tom.

19:44.465 --> 19:46.090
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

19:46.174 --> 19:47.257
- Very good.

19:47.340 --> 19:48.590
Hey, Global Tom.
How you shaking?

19:48.673 --> 19:49.965
You still fucking shit up
for us?

19:50.049 --> 19:52.049
Still cleaning up
your mess, pal.

19:52.132 --> 19:53.757
Yeah, right.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.132
- Hey, sis.
- Hi.

19:55.215 --> 19:57.174
Politics still boring
the living shit out of you?

19:57.257 --> 19:59.590
Yeah, you know,
I'm burying the bodies,
counting the cash.

19:59.673 --> 20:03.007
Look at you.
You like, you know,
an actual human person.

20:03.090 --> 20:04.965
- Well, thanks, buddy.
- Mm-hmm.

20:05.049 --> 20:06.631
- Hi.

20:06.715 --> 20:07.840
Date Rape by Calvin Klein?

20:07.923 --> 20:10.007
Yeah, you wish.

20:10.090 --> 20:12.299
"You wish"?

20:14.257 --> 20:15.923
- Mr. Roy!
- Mr. Roy, please!

20:16.007 --> 20:17.673
Mr. Roy. Over here.
One shot, please.

20:17.757 --> 20:19.257
Colin: Say, guys,
can we back off?

20:19.340 --> 20:21.506
- Guys, back off. Private event.

20:21.590 --> 20:25.381
Logan, Logan, you going today?
Is that right

20:25.465 --> 20:27.506
- Back off, please.
- Fuck off.

20:27.590 --> 20:29.840
- Just one shot!

20:31.506 --> 20:32.840
Mr. Roy.

20:32.923 --> 20:35.257
Hi. Hello. Hello there.

20:35.340 --> 20:36.923
Whoa. Can I help you, sir?

20:37.007 --> 20:40.132
Yeah, I'm actually--
I'm actually here to see you.

20:40.215 --> 20:41.965
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

20:42.049 --> 20:44.381
- Get your hands back!

20:45.923 --> 20:48.299
- Greg! I'm Greg!

20:48.381 --> 20:51.465
I'm Marianne's Greg.
Your nephew?

20:51.548 --> 20:54.299
- My Mom called Marcia

20:54.381 --> 20:58.049
and I talked to that guy
and he said that I could go up.

20:58.132 --> 21:00.090
- Right.

21:00.174 --> 21:01.882
I didn't know you were coming.

21:01.965 --> 21:04.465
- Yeah, you did.
- Sorry about that, guy.

21:04.548 --> 21:07.174
- I think you did.

21:07.257 --> 21:09.174
- Sorry about that.
- I hope it's OK.

21:09.257 --> 21:11.007
I wanted to say happy birth--

21:11.090 --> 21:13.090
Happy birthday
and many happy returns.

21:13.174 --> 21:14.340
Oh, thank you.

21:16.381 --> 21:18.423
I suppose you better come up.

21:19.923 --> 21:22.257
Greg:
He's a very good bodyguard.

21:23.715 --> 21:25.548
- Folks, he's back!

21:25.631 --> 21:28.174
He's back. Find a place.
Hide for the surprise. Come on.

21:28.257 --> 21:29.673
Oh, we're not surprising him,
are we?

21:29.757 --> 21:32.882
- Yeah.
- Oh, he's gonna love this.

21:32.965 --> 21:34.423
Think last time I surprised him,

21:34.506 --> 21:36.257
he took a swing at me.

21:36.340 --> 21:40.631
Greg: You might know this,
but I got a little bit of help,

21:40.715 --> 21:43.215
and I got onto
the international
management training program?

21:43.299 --> 21:44.715
The theme park tour?

21:44.798 --> 21:47.506
And I was very into it?

21:48.715 --> 21:51.423
And...I got sick.

21:52.465 --> 21:54.423
Out of Doderick's eyeholes.

21:55.465 --> 21:56.506
All:
Surprise!

21:56.590 --> 21:58.506
Great. Excellent. Wonderful.

21:58.590 --> 21:59.923
Go ahead. Go ahead.

22:00.007 --> 22:02.381
Hi. Hi.

22:02.465 --> 22:05.215
OK. OK. Give me room.
Give me room.

22:05.299 --> 22:09.715
Thank you. Thank you.
What a surprise.

22:09.798 --> 22:11.215
- Marcia.

22:11.299 --> 22:14.381
What did I say?
I said nobody by the elevator.

22:14.465 --> 22:17.423
And what do I find?
Everybody's by the elevator.

22:17.506 --> 22:19.215
- It's a surprise.
- Oh, a surprise.

22:19.299 --> 22:20.548
Give me that.

22:20.631 --> 22:22.590
In the office, please.

22:22.673 --> 22:25.798
Connor, Primo!
How are you?

22:25.882 --> 22:28.923
Good. Excellent, Pa.
Here you go.

22:29.007 --> 22:31.299
Ah.

22:31.381 --> 22:32.715
Roman! Romulus!

22:32.798 --> 22:34.631
Look at you!
You look fantastic!

22:34.715 --> 22:35.840
Yeah, of course.

22:35.923 --> 22:37.423
Happy birthday.

22:37.506 --> 22:39.174
Siobhan. Sweetheart.

22:39.257 --> 22:40.590
Happy birthday.

22:40.673 --> 22:41.715
Where's Tom?

22:41.798 --> 22:43.590
He's here.
He's just there.

22:43.673 --> 22:45.590
Oh, well, never mind.

22:48.548 --> 22:50.923
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

22:51.007 --> 22:54.049
Everybody, this is...

22:54.132 --> 22:56.007
Craig, by the way.

22:56.090 --> 22:58.757
Cousin Craig.

22:58.840 --> 23:02.465
"Craig"

23:02.548 --> 23:04.590
Greg:
Yeah. Greg.

23:04.673 --> 23:09.548
People sometimes, like,
mistakenly call me Craig, too,

23:09.631 --> 23:11.631
- so I'll answer to both.

23:11.715 --> 23:16.506
Here. This is just a token
of my very real and enduring
admiration, in the hope--

23:16.590 --> 23:18.090
Kendall?

23:20.049 --> 23:21.882
You came?

23:24.007 --> 23:25.340
Yeah, of course.

23:27.090 --> 23:28.882
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Uh-huh.

23:28.965 --> 23:30.798
- Hey, Marcy.
- Hi.

23:30.882 --> 23:32.548
- Siobhan: Big day.

23:32.631 --> 23:34.840
Congratulations...
you bastard.

23:34.923 --> 23:37.257
- Congratulations. Good luck.
- Thanks.

23:37.340 --> 23:38.923
Hey. Hey, Kendall.

23:41.340 --> 23:46.174
- Yeah, good, good.
We're at the one-yard line.

23:46.257 --> 23:48.257
I'm just gonna--
This is important.

23:48.340 --> 23:50.673
Uh, sorry, guys,
I'll be right back.

23:50.757 --> 23:52.965
Excuse me. Hello.

23:54.465 --> 23:56.506
I hear you went down?
Did you go down?

23:56.590 --> 23:58.132
Oh, yeah, I did.

23:58.215 --> 23:59.840
Not so good.

23:59.923 --> 24:01.423
It's a shitshow.

24:02.465 --> 24:03.798
Just gotta get somewhere quiet.

24:03.882 --> 24:05.132
Alessandro:
Yeah, I got news.

24:05.215 --> 24:06.631
Hey, talk to me.

24:06.715 --> 24:08.673
Yeah, PPG Bank
have got their nose in,

24:08.757 --> 24:10.340
might be rustling up
another bid.

24:10.423 --> 24:13.299
Word's out. We gotta move.
What do you wanna do?

24:13.381 --> 24:14.882
I'm gonna call you back
in five.

24:14.965 --> 24:17.673
- I'm not losing this deal.
- All right.

24:17.757 --> 24:20.340
We call PPG, we offer
to cut them in on the financing

24:20.423 --> 24:22.007
if they make the other bid
fuck off.

24:22.090 --> 24:24.757
Great idea, Ken,
great idea.

24:24.840 --> 24:29.215
Boom. Kendall takes over.
Boom. Acquisition.

24:29.299 --> 24:30.465
That's how it's done.

24:32.423 --> 24:34.090
Hey, you know, I wanted
to talk to you about Tom.

24:34.174 --> 24:36.381
He thinks he might
be ready for the parks,

24:36.465 --> 24:38.381
- you know, globally and--
- Look, Dad,

24:38.465 --> 24:40.381
we should get this
somewhere ambient.

24:42.215 --> 24:43.840
- Oh, perfect.

24:43.923 --> 24:46.340
The light pollution
is practically zero,

24:46.423 --> 24:48.381
so, you know, that's nice.

24:48.465 --> 24:50.340
- Hey.
- Oh, wonderful.

24:52.757 --> 24:53.757
What is it?

24:53.840 --> 24:55.381
- Well...
- Oh, yes, yes.

24:55.465 --> 24:56.882
It's a--
It's a goo.

24:56.965 --> 24:58.215
It's a fucking goo?

24:58.299 --> 24:59.631
It's perfect.

24:59.715 --> 25:01.215
It's sourdough starter.

25:01.299 --> 25:02.882
Amazing.

25:02.965 --> 25:04.923
I thought that you might
like to make something.

25:05.007 --> 25:06.882
- Ah, great.

25:06.965 --> 25:09.590
Yeah, OK, you shouldn't
have opened it. OK?

25:09.673 --> 25:11.299
Never mind, forget it.

25:11.381 --> 25:12.923
It was an idea.
I thought you might like it.

25:13.007 --> 25:14.965
I do. I do.

25:15.049 --> 25:16.882
I just don't know
what the fuck it is.

25:16.965 --> 25:18.465
It's sourdough starter

25:18.548 --> 25:21.798
to make bread without yeast--
the old way.

25:21.882 --> 25:24.465
Oh. Oh, OK.

25:24.548 --> 25:27.257
Old bread. Thank you.

25:27.340 --> 25:30.465
- Marcia: It's very kind.
Thank you very much.
- You bet.

25:30.548 --> 25:32.132
Be nice.

25:36.049 --> 25:37.506
How's it lookin'?

25:37.590 --> 25:38.506
Looking good.

25:38.590 --> 25:40.090
I'll keep you posted.

25:40.174 --> 25:44.548
I just checked with Frank,
and the holidays mean

25:44.631 --> 25:46.757
the board might be
kinda hard to get together,

25:46.840 --> 25:49.423
so if it's cool
I've scheduled a call at 4:00?

25:49.506 --> 25:51.923
Then we can
issue the release?

25:52.007 --> 25:53.299
Uh

25:53.381 --> 25:56.049
Yeah. Is that OK?

25:57.548 --> 25:58.673
Hey.

25:58.757 --> 26:01.299
You go on.

26:01.381 --> 26:02.965
I'm not going.

26:03.049 --> 26:06.299
- Hey. Give Daddy a hug.
- Hi, Daddy.

26:06.381 --> 26:07.590
Sorry we're late.

26:07.673 --> 26:08.798
No, no, you're not even.
Don't worry.

26:08.882 --> 26:10.590
Twenty's the margin of error.

26:10.673 --> 26:12.798
Hey, sorry I haven't Skyped
with you guys in a couple days.

26:12.882 --> 26:14.590
I've been super busy.
You feel good?

26:14.673 --> 26:15.965
- I'm good.
- OK.

26:16.049 --> 26:18.381
You see Isla up there?
Your friend Isla?

26:18.465 --> 26:22.049
You guys wanna go see her,
maybe make a drawing for Grandpa
for his birthday?

26:24.882 --> 26:25.965
Sorry, one second.

26:26.049 --> 26:28.757
It's OK. Oh, uh,

26:28.840 --> 26:30.965
I got your message.
That's fine.

26:31.049 --> 26:32.923
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

26:33.007 --> 26:35.257
It's just as this
all goes through,

26:35.340 --> 26:37.631
next two weekends
will be kinda crazy.

26:37.715 --> 26:39.757
But then once it's done,
it would be great if--

26:39.840 --> 26:42.340
Yeah, no, it's fine.
Bank the weekends,
spend them later.

26:42.423 --> 26:44.340
OK. I can come up to you.

26:44.423 --> 26:49.840
Maybe if you want, we could
grab dinner for the hand

26:49.923 --> 26:53.882
Ugh. What, like two weekends?
Um...

26:53.965 --> 26:56.840
No? Are you--
Is that not--

26:56.923 --> 26:58.465
Are you seeing someone?

27:01.590 --> 27:02.840
Yeah.

27:02.923 --> 27:05.506
I am.

27:05.590 --> 27:09.631
And I'm just hoping this one
doesn't leave coke smeared
all over the kids' iPads.

27:12.798 --> 27:15.631
All right, that's fair.

27:15.715 --> 27:17.465
- Oh, God.
- It was three years ago, but--

27:17.548 --> 27:19.673
Kendall, I'm fucking with you.

27:19.757 --> 27:22.174
It's OK, it's OK.
You're good.

27:22.257 --> 27:24.590
This is a big day.
Coronation day.

27:24.673 --> 27:26.299
- Yeah.
- Hey, you deserve this.

27:27.631 --> 27:30.381
Seriously.
After everything.

27:30.465 --> 27:32.465
Marcia:
Guys, lunch in ten.

27:32.548 --> 27:36.715
Listen, just
two minutes before lunch
in the sitting room.

27:36.798 --> 27:39.215
Kids. Can you
give me two minutes.

27:40.381 --> 27:41.715
Got a speech.

27:41.798 --> 27:44.798
- So, Uncle Logan, can I--
- Not now.

27:47.381 --> 27:51.257
Sorry, sir. Sir, sir, just,
I need your attention, please.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.840
About the--
what I was talking
about earlier,

27:54.923 --> 27:56.965
the management
training program?

27:57.049 --> 27:59.965
I need to get back in.

28:00.049 --> 28:01.757
- Yes.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.590
There was an issue,
and I talked to my mom

28:04.673 --> 28:07.132
who talked to my grandfather
and said that I can come to you

28:07.215 --> 28:10.174
and-- and iron it out.

28:10.257 --> 28:13.923
I'll do anything
for my brother.

28:14.007 --> 28:16.757
Oh, that's-- that's nice.

28:16.840 --> 28:18.590
And I'm gonna work 100%--

28:18.673 --> 28:21.007
All he needs to do is just ask.

28:21.090 --> 28:23.423
My grandfather?

28:23.506 --> 28:26.548
I mean, you two
don't talk so much.

28:26.631 --> 28:28.423
Right?

28:28.506 --> 28:30.174
Anything.

28:30.257 --> 28:32.007
Just get him to ask me.

28:38.840 --> 28:40.090
Fuck!

28:42.007 --> 28:43.049
Ah.

28:44.299 --> 28:45.840
- Dad.
- Yes.

28:45.923 --> 28:47.506
Roman:
Yeah, what's the deal?

28:47.590 --> 28:50.673
So...

28:50.757 --> 28:53.882
On the family trust,
which will decide the situation

28:53.965 --> 28:58.715
in the event
of my unlikely demise,

28:58.798 --> 29:01.965
I'm going to add Marcy
to myself and you four.

29:02.049 --> 29:03.757
Whoa. OK.

29:03.840 --> 29:08.381
And my seat
also to go to her
on my death.

29:08.465 --> 29:12.506
What? Wait, that gives her
double voting weight.

29:12.590 --> 29:14.965
Uh-huh. So I've got
some paperwork--

29:15.049 --> 29:16.299
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

29:16.381 --> 29:18.673
So Marcia will have two votes
when you--

29:18.757 --> 29:19.757
"If" he--

29:19.840 --> 29:21.257
Well, no, Rome, it's not an if.

29:21.340 --> 29:23.007
Well, excuse me
if I don't want him to--

29:23.090 --> 29:25.506
Well, it's not really what
we want in this case, Rome.

29:25.590 --> 29:27.923
Kendall's already signed,
but if I can get you all to--

29:28.007 --> 29:30.506
Two votes? I don't think
I was aware of that when I--

29:30.590 --> 29:33.090
Roman:
Read the small print, asshole.

29:35.840 --> 29:39.007
Shiv:
I mean, this looks...

29:39.090 --> 29:43.007
I'm gonna have to talk
to my lawyers, just for
all the implications.

29:43.090 --> 29:44.007
Logan:
Of course.

29:44.090 --> 29:45.007
Just to get the full picture.

29:45.090 --> 29:46.590
Sure, take a beat.

29:46.673 --> 29:52.007
But look,
I love the bread-- goo--

29:52.090 --> 29:55.757
but this is the present
I really want.

29:55.840 --> 29:58.840
So: By 4:00, good?

29:58.923 --> 30:04.007
Oh, also, I already
mentioned to Kendall,

30:04.090 --> 30:08.715
despite the chatter
and all things considered,

30:08.798 --> 30:11.465
I'm going to give it
a couple of years.

30:11.548 --> 30:12.757
Siobhan:
As in?

30:12.840 --> 30:14.715
I'll stay in situ.

30:14.798 --> 30:17.798
As chairman, CEO,
head of the firm.

30:20.132 --> 30:23.174
Dad, wh

30:23.257 --> 30:27.049
I just said, son, or were you
not listening, as usual?

30:27.132 --> 30:30.215
But I'm

30:30.299 --> 30:32.506
It's no big deal.
I'm staying on.

30:32.590 --> 30:35.090
- We can discuss the details.
- You didn't tell me.

30:35.174 --> 30:36.548
We can announce
you're in pole position,

30:36.631 --> 30:38.465
pending events,
a move up or whatever.

30:38.548 --> 30:42.590
- OK, come on, let's eat.

30:42.673 --> 30:44.590
Dad, wait.

30:44.673 --> 30:47.007
Roman:
Oh, fuck!

30:49.174 --> 30:50.965
I don't know what you're
fucking laughing about!

30:51.049 --> 30:54.590
I'm not even laughing. What?!

30:54.673 --> 30:56.673
Kendall:
Fuck. What the fuck.

30:56.757 --> 30:58.381
I mean, he can't just...

30:58.465 --> 30:59.923
Right?

31:00.007 --> 31:02.757
He's gonna blow
the firm's credibility.

31:02.840 --> 31:05.090
Did he look OK to you?

31:05.174 --> 31:09.090
Oh, come on!
Ken, this is typical. It's Dad.

31:09.174 --> 31:11.132
I'm out, OK?

31:11.215 --> 31:12.090
I'm not playing.

31:12.174 --> 31:13.923
Whatever you three decide, goes.

31:14.007 --> 31:15.757
- Goodbye.
- Connor.

31:15.840 --> 31:17.423
On the trust, I refuse to play.

31:17.506 --> 31:21.381
I don't want to engage.
I'm water, I flow.

31:25.548 --> 31:28.007
This doesn't stand, right?

31:28.090 --> 31:29.548
I...

31:29.631 --> 31:32.757
Oh, fucking shrug?
You're fucking shrugging me?

31:32.840 --> 31:33.882
Oh.

31:36.506 --> 31:38.299
Are you texting?
Dude, what are you--

31:38.381 --> 31:39.798
- Hey, hey!

31:41.548 --> 31:43.340
Private.
- Hey, this stays in here.

31:43.423 --> 31:45.715
This is a lockdown.
- We all need advice, man.

31:45.798 --> 31:47.631
Advice
You're gonna give a double vote

31:47.715 --> 31:49.007
to a power-hungry maniac

31:49.090 --> 31:50.757
who will do
fuck-knows-what with it

31:50.840 --> 31:52.965
because she's got our dad's dick
in some Super Max pussy grip

31:53.049 --> 31:54.590
and she's juicing him
before he croaks?

31:54.673 --> 31:56.882
Guys? Lunch is coming up.

31:59.340 --> 32:02.548
Sorry, I don't mean
to be strict.

32:13.548 --> 32:17.299
Can you give us a minute,
please? Thank you.

32:20.257 --> 32:24.257
Hey. So...you fucked me.

32:24.340 --> 32:26.798
I changed my mind, Kendall.

32:26.882 --> 32:29.381
When?
When, exactly.

32:29.465 --> 32:31.381
'Cause it feels
like you fucked me.

32:31.465 --> 32:34.882
It's me.
It's mainly me.

32:34.965 --> 32:36.340
But you--

32:36.423 --> 32:38.007
Three years ago,

32:38.090 --> 32:41.090
you were still
in the nuthouse.

32:41.174 --> 32:43.840
Rehab, Dad.
It's called rehab.

32:43.923 --> 32:45.506
And I'm in recovery.

32:45.590 --> 32:47.007
It's all good.

32:47.090 --> 32:50.423
I'm just concerned
you might be soft, as yet.

32:50.506 --> 32:52.631
S Are you kidding?

32:52.715 --> 32:55.882
I did a fucking year
in Shanghai.

32:55.965 --> 32:58.257
I hear you let the guy
from the website trash-talk you

32:58.340 --> 32:59.590
and you just let him come.

32:59.673 --> 33:01.007
It's not a website.

33:01.090 --> 33:03.299
And I was being professional.

33:03.381 --> 33:06.548
I hear it played weak.
Conflict averse.

33:06.631 --> 33:09.381
I wasn't about to get into
a fucking big dick competition.

33:09.465 --> 33:11.007
OK?

33:11.090 --> 33:12.882
Logan:
I hear you bent for him.

33:12.965 --> 33:14.215
Wha

33:14.299 --> 33:17.882
I hear you bent for him
and he fucked you.

33:17.965 --> 33:21.757
Well, no, actually.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.299
I know that you've
read a lot of books

33:23.381 --> 33:26.215
about business management
and this and that,

33:26.299 --> 33:28.257
but you know what?

33:28.340 --> 33:29.590
What?

33:29.673 --> 33:35.174
Sometimes it is
a big dick competition.

33:35.257 --> 33:36.757
OK. OK. So that's it?

33:36.840 --> 33:40.257
So I should have shouted
at some guy, but I didn't.

33:40.340 --> 33:43.174
So you've ripped up 18 months
of corporate strategy?

33:43.257 --> 33:45.381
And you never lawyered
the trust change.

33:45.465 --> 33:47.132
I trusted my father.
That's a black mark?

33:47.215 --> 33:49.340
It's an accumulation.

33:50.882 --> 33:53.049
You left the room. The deal.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.090
To come to my Dad's
fucking birthday party

33:55.174 --> 33:58.215
'cause we don't know
how many more there'll be!

33:58.299 --> 33:59.631
Sorry.

33:59.715 --> 34:01.590
So come on.

34:01.673 --> 34:03.590
When will you be ready?

34:03.673 --> 34:04.965
To step down?

34:05.049 --> 34:06.631
I don't know.

34:09.381 --> 34:10.506
Five?

34:10.590 --> 34:12.090
Five years?

34:12.174 --> 34:13.132
Ten?

34:13.215 --> 34:15.090
Ten! Dad? Seriously!

34:16.798 --> 34:18.965
It's my fuckin' company.

34:19.049 --> 34:20.965
Yeah, it is
your fucking company,
and you know what?

34:21.049 --> 34:24.590
You're running it
into the fucking ground.

34:24.673 --> 34:26.798
You spend all your time
on costs--

34:26.882 --> 34:29.299
where's the vision?
You're off the beat.

34:29.381 --> 34:32.132
Where's the growth?
All our graphs go down.
All of them.

34:32.215 --> 34:35.090
Is that why you're
paying a billion dollars
for a gay little website?

34:35.174 --> 34:37.215
It is not a fucking website!

34:37.299 --> 34:40.965
It's a portfolio
of online brands
and digital video content

34:41.049 --> 34:46.215
and it's part of an
upstream investment strategy to
save us, if you'll just let me.

34:53.381 --> 34:55.757
Do you want to hit me,
is that it?

34:58.215 --> 34:59.506
Huh?

34:59.590 --> 35:00.840
Go on.

35:00.923 --> 35:02.548
Go on.

35:02.631 --> 35:04.590
Give it your best shot.

35:07.257 --> 35:09.257
Dad, come on.
What are you doing?

35:11.548 --> 35:13.381
Are you gonna fuckin' cry?

35:15.381 --> 35:19.049
Kendall,
are you fuckin' crying?

35:20.548 --> 35:22.299
You know, this has been
floated already?

35:22.381 --> 35:25.840
There's fucking paps outside.
I'm getting asked for quotes.

35:25.923 --> 35:28.174
Fuck them.

35:28.257 --> 35:29.381
Yeah, 'course, "fuck 'em."

35:29.465 --> 35:32.049
Great, great
media strategy, Dad.

35:32.132 --> 35:33.673
Great business strategy.

35:33.757 --> 35:36.965
- The world is changing--
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:37.049 --> 35:38.631
Yeah, everything changes.

35:38.715 --> 35:41.340
The studio was gonna tank
when I bought it,

35:41.423 --> 35:43.631
everyone was gonna stay home
with video tapes.

35:43.715 --> 35:48.381
But guess what?
No! They wanna go out.

35:48.465 --> 35:50.215
No one was gonna
watch Network,

35:50.299 --> 35:52.548
except you give it zing
and they do.

35:52.631 --> 35:54.631
You make your own reality.

35:54.715 --> 35:56.965
And once you've done it,
apparently,

35:57.049 --> 36:01.548
everybody's of the opinion
it was all so fucking obvious.

36:01.631 --> 36:04.590
Lunch!

36:13.007 --> 36:16.049
Logan:
Come on. Find your places. Sit.

36:16.132 --> 36:19.340
Marcia:
Please give me my seating plan.

36:19.423 --> 36:21.174
This is confusing. Sorry.

37:48.673 --> 37:51.423
She was drunk and sitting
in Gore Vidal's lap.

37:51.506 --> 37:53.049
She's very funny.

37:53.132 --> 37:55.590
- Your mom's very funny.

37:55.673 --> 37:58.590
She's the one, you know,
with the hair, and she
usually wears the clothes?

37:58.673 --> 37:59.840
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:59.923 --> 38:01.506
Yeah, no,
I remember your daughter.

38:04.299 --> 38:08.257
Marcy. This was delicious.
Thank you.

38:08.340 --> 38:10.506
Oh, thank you.

38:10.590 --> 38:12.673
Yeah, the whole day.
Really thoughtful.

38:12.757 --> 38:14.007
It's been great.

38:14.090 --> 38:17.174
Marcia:
Thank you very much.

38:17.257 --> 38:19.299
You're a suck-up.

38:19.381 --> 38:20.882
Marcia:
I'm happy to have you.

38:20.965 --> 38:24.174
"You are so swell,
Double Vote Power Mom!"

38:24.257 --> 38:25.715
You know what?
Fuck you.

38:28.007 --> 38:30.840
Yeah, if you'll excuse me...

38:30.923 --> 38:34.174
Logan Roy.

38:34.257 --> 38:38.840
Born in Dundee, Scotland,
80 years ago today,

38:38.923 --> 38:43.548
raised in Quebec by an uncle
with a print shop and a few
advertising billboards

38:43.631 --> 38:46.257
and an aunt
with a herd of cattle.

38:46.340 --> 38:51.215
Logan himself has made
a decent way for himself
these past 60 years.

38:51.299 --> 38:55.882
Fifth largest media conglomerate
in the world.

38:55.965 --> 39:01.299
A pal to prime ministers,
a truth teller to presidents.

39:01.381 --> 39:05.090
He's tough, he's wily,

39:05.174 --> 39:08.257
but he's always true
to his word.

39:08.340 --> 39:11.590
I arrived to give him
legal advice 30 years ago,

39:11.673 --> 39:14.132
and I never got out the door.

39:14.215 --> 39:20.007
And since that day,
I'm proud to call him a friend.

39:20.090 --> 39:24.299
So, let's raise a toast.

39:24.381 --> 39:25.923
Logan Roy.

39:26.007 --> 39:28.007
All:
Logan Roy.

39:29.215 --> 39:30.965
Thank you.

39:32.381 --> 39:37.506
So, I think it's time
to play the game.

39:37.590 --> 39:39.923
We're playing the game?

39:40.007 --> 39:42.090
Well, yes.

39:42.174 --> 39:46.132
It's my birthday, so yes,
we're playing the game.

39:46.215 --> 39:47.923
Siobhan:
Do we have to play the game?

39:52.049 --> 39:53.673
What's the game?

39:59.174 --> 40:01.882
Nice day!
You OK, Greg?

40:01.965 --> 40:04.090
Sure. I'm not...

40:04.174 --> 40:06.798
Is there room
in there?

40:06.882 --> 40:08.548
Hop in.

40:16.257 --> 40:18.257
I'm sorry
if it's a crush.

40:18.340 --> 40:19.882
It's fine.

40:21.757 --> 40:22.882
Greg:
Oh, um, yeah,

40:22.965 --> 40:25.090
I was just talking
to my grandpa.

40:25.174 --> 40:26.132
Uh-huh.

40:26.215 --> 40:28.299
And he said happy birthday.

40:28.381 --> 40:30.340
Did he?

40:30.423 --> 40:33.215
Well, no, not technically,

40:33.299 --> 40:35.673
but he's aware
it's your birthday.

40:35.757 --> 40:38.007
But it occurred to me,
talking to him,

40:38.090 --> 40:43.340
that him having his seat
on the holding company still,
from historically,

40:43.423 --> 40:46.090
now, that must be suboptimal,
in some ways.

40:48.423 --> 40:51.798
But if I could--
if he was willing
to give his seat

40:51.882 --> 40:54.590
to someone a bit
more perspicacious,

40:54.673 --> 40:58.340
someone who
could learn the ropes,
running a theme park, say.

40:58.423 --> 41:00.340
Logan:
Running the parks?

41:00.423 --> 41:02.798
Just a little guy.
Learning, you know?

41:02.882 --> 41:04.090
I mean, could that be...?

41:04.174 --> 41:05.840
You scratch my back, I--

41:05.923 --> 41:08.715
I'm not gonna say
I could scratch yours.

41:08.798 --> 41:11.757
It's be too considerable
of a space.

41:11.840 --> 41:16.049
But is there
an angle there, perhaps?

42:10.381 --> 42:12.798
( game music playing
on tablet )

42:12.882 --> 42:14.882
Logan: So...

42:14.965 --> 42:17.798
what're you thinking, son?

42:17.882 --> 42:19.798
On the thing?

42:21.548 --> 42:23.257
She's very smart.

42:23.340 --> 42:26.548
Logan:
She'd make good picks.
Family first.

42:26.631 --> 42:29.132
Roman:
I'm sure. I'm sure.

42:30.715 --> 42:33.132
But what's your cut?

42:33.215 --> 42:34.631
Um...No.

42:34.715 --> 42:37.174
No. God no, Dad.
No, it's your firm.

42:37.257 --> 42:39.882
Like, it's not
what's in it for me.

42:41.548 --> 42:45.465
But you know, like,
what is  in it for me?

42:49.049 --> 42:50.840
I'd love to get you back in.

42:50.923 --> 42:52.174
Sure. No, sure.

42:52.257 --> 42:55.299
It's just it was
tough last time.

42:55.381 --> 42:57.757
It was very tough
with Frank over me in LA.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.757
Logan:
Frank's very important
to the firm.

42:59.840 --> 43:01.715
Oh, no, sure. No, of course,
I understand that.

43:01.798 --> 43:05.132
It's just I had a lot of ideas
at the studio.

43:05.215 --> 43:07.965
As you know, I'm quite
an innovative thinker,

43:08.049 --> 43:11.673
and I was met with
a lot of resistance.

43:13.923 --> 43:16.631
Is this still the film thing?

43:17.757 --> 43:19.923
No

43:20.007 --> 43:22.923
No, Dad, it's not about
one fantastic idea.

43:23.007 --> 43:25.007
It was a culture.
There were many of them.

43:25.090 --> 43:27.465
What would be your dream outfit?

43:27.548 --> 43:30.506
I wanna run
the damn show.
I do.

43:30.590 --> 43:34.257
And until it opens up,
Chief Operating Officer.

43:34.340 --> 43:36.631
But I guess...

43:36.715 --> 43:38.257
I guess that's Frank, huh?

43:39.923 --> 43:41.465
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

43:47.548 --> 43:48.423
You OK?

43:49.965 --> 43:52.090
Sure. You?

44:10.465 --> 44:12.840
Man:
The boys are here!

44:12.923 --> 44:14.465
Just right this way.

44:17.465 --> 44:19.840
Greg: That was
my first helicopter ride.

44:19.923 --> 44:21.840
It was so crazy.

44:21.923 --> 44:23.548
It goes so much faster
than I thought.

44:23.631 --> 44:24.923
Hey, it's good to see you.

44:30.299 --> 44:32.423
Greg:
OK, let's get a glove.

44:32.506 --> 44:33.757
Let's have
a second.

44:37.506 --> 44:38.673
What time is it?

44:40.174 --> 44:41.215
Ah!

44:41.299 --> 44:43.548
Oh!

44:43.631 --> 44:47.215
- Toss it over here!
- Come on back, come on back.

44:47.299 --> 44:51.381
Now that things
are getting shaken up,
would you come inside?

44:51.465 --> 44:54.049
Dad, I'm not just playing
with the politics.

44:54.132 --> 44:57.257
Oh, no, of course.
Politics.

44:57.340 --> 45:02.007
Not to be crude about it,
but politics is what
comes out the asshole.

45:02.090 --> 45:04.299
Wouldn't you rather be up front,
feeding the horse?

45:04.381 --> 45:07.465
Well, Joyce,
she's got that
Air Force One look.

45:07.548 --> 45:10.506
So... to come back,

45:10.590 --> 45:12.798
I'd want the top job.

45:12.882 --> 45:15.215
And if that was difficult?

45:17.840 --> 45:21.465
Overseeing everything outside
the US, parks and all.

45:21.548 --> 45:25.132
What, like...
Tom's boss?

45:25.215 --> 45:27.548
Yeah. Stepping stones.

45:31.299 --> 45:33.506
Siobhan:
What's the rescue pup
looking for?

45:33.590 --> 45:36.798
Logan:
He screwed up. Needs help.

45:36.882 --> 45:40.381
He might fit in eventually
to the parks.

45:40.465 --> 45:42.673
Do you think Tom
can handle the competition?

45:44.798 --> 45:46.257
Mr. Roy. All set.

45:46.340 --> 45:47.299
Mm.

45:47.381 --> 45:48.882
Man:
There you go.

45:51.049 --> 45:52.299
Hey.

45:52.381 --> 45:55.132
So, just wanted
to give this to you

45:55.215 --> 45:58.798
in person just to say,
you know, happy birthday.

45:58.882 --> 45:59.923
Hold that, will you?

46:00.007 --> 46:01.381
So...

46:01.465 --> 46:02.840
there we go.

46:02.923 --> 46:05.340
Oh! Mm.

46:05.423 --> 46:09.299
It's just a Patek Philippe.
So...

46:09.381 --> 46:11.340
Yeah, it says "Patek Philippe."

46:11.423 --> 46:12.673
Yeah. I know.

46:12.757 --> 46:14.049
It's incredibly accurate.

46:14.132 --> 46:15.381
Every time you look at it,

46:15.465 --> 46:17.506
it tells you
exactly how rich you are.

46:17.590 --> 46:19.923
- That's very funny.

46:22.423 --> 46:26.340
No. Well, no. Yes. But--

46:26.423 --> 46:29.715
OK. Yeah.

46:29.798 --> 46:31.506
Here.

46:31.590 --> 46:33.423
OK, let's play ball.

46:34.757 --> 46:37.340
Kendall:
So, what are you thinking?

46:37.423 --> 46:41.715
We say no , all of us,
on the trust. Full block.

46:41.798 --> 46:43.798
We say: stability.
Stick to the plan.

46:43.882 --> 46:45.506
I take over and we just--

46:45.590 --> 46:48.257
you two, under me,
co-presidents.

46:48.340 --> 46:50.215
- Uh-huh.

46:50.299 --> 46:53.174
But, you know, three.
The power of three?

46:53.257 --> 46:54.548
Interesting.

46:54.631 --> 46:56.174
- Kendall: Of course.

46:56.257 --> 46:58.090
I thought about it. Fuck you.

47:01.798 --> 47:03.007
Woman: Go, Rava!

47:03.090 --> 47:04.381
Man:
Psych your mind!

47:04.465 --> 47:05.882
Go!

47:05.965 --> 47:07.715
That's a strike.

47:07.798 --> 47:10.049
- Got her looking!
- That's good pitching.

47:10.132 --> 47:11.631
- Siobhan: Change sides!
- Tom: Hey, man.

47:11.715 --> 47:13.049
It was balletic, though,

47:13.132 --> 47:14.090
kinda came around..

47:14.174 --> 47:15.757
I hear you're the new kid. Yeah?

47:15.840 --> 47:17.215
Oh, well, I mean,
I'm just kinda starting--

47:17.299 --> 47:18.882
- I hear you're coming in.
- Yeah.

47:18.965 --> 47:21.132
Yeah, eyes on the prize.

47:21.215 --> 47:25.340
Well, I have got
my eye on you.

47:25.423 --> 47:27.257
Yeah, you need any help,

47:27.340 --> 47:30.299
seriously, any help,
any advice, just, you know,

47:30.381 --> 47:32.882
don't fuckin' bother, OK?

47:34.381 --> 47:37.590
I'm only razzing you, cuz.

47:37.673 --> 47:39.215
You're dreaming, really.

47:39.299 --> 47:40.715
I'm razzing you.

47:40.798 --> 47:41.840
- OK.
- That was a joke.

47:41.923 --> 47:43.590
No, really.

47:43.673 --> 47:44.631
You know, the thing,

47:44.715 --> 47:45.631
I may look really fun,

47:45.715 --> 47:46.631
- Yeah.

47:46.715 --> 47:48.090
But the thing about me

47:48.174 --> 47:50.381
is that I'm a terrible,
terrible prick.

47:52.381 --> 47:54.757
I got you again.
I just got you again.

47:55.840 --> 47:58.049
Fuck me, man, your face.

47:58.132 --> 48:00.590
Pals. Yes?

48:00.673 --> 48:02.257
Yeah.

48:02.340 --> 48:04.007
Would you kiss me?

48:04.090 --> 48:06.299
Kiss you?

48:06.381 --> 48:09.423
If I asked you to?

48:09.506 --> 48:13.007
Huh?

48:15.090 --> 48:16.590
- I don't--

48:16.673 --> 48:18.049
Come on.

48:18.132 --> 48:21.174
- I'm joking. I'm joking.

48:21.257 --> 48:23.840
- All right, Siobhan.
- Siobhan: Bring it!

48:24.965 --> 48:26.299
Batter swing!

48:26.381 --> 48:29.631
- Just like that!

48:29.715 --> 48:30.965
Oh!

48:31.049 --> 48:32.965
Hold up. Hang on, hang on.
Sorry.

48:33.049 --> 48:34.548
- Apologies.
- Boo! Boo.

48:34.631 --> 48:35.798
Honey, boo him.

48:35.882 --> 48:37.132
- Yeah. OK. Sorry. I gotta run.
- Boo!

48:37.215 --> 48:38.174
It's the crunch.

48:38.257 --> 48:39.965
Frank, will you be
link man here?

48:40.049 --> 48:41.673
- Frank: Uh-huh.

48:41.757 --> 48:42.840
Of course.

48:42.923 --> 48:44.757
Come here, sweetie.

48:44.840 --> 48:49.174
Well, if Kendall's going,
we need one more
to make it fair!

48:49.257 --> 48:51.340
Kendall: Keep it up, slugger.

48:51.423 --> 48:55.757
The kid. Hey! Hello!

48:55.840 --> 48:57.673
Hello! Kid. Yeah. Yes.

48:57.757 --> 49:00.465
You. You. You wanna play?

49:00.548 --> 49:02.299
Dad, can he play?

49:02.381 --> 49:04.506
Yes. Sure.

49:04.590 --> 49:06.715
Roman:
Thank you, Dad.

49:08.090 --> 49:09.381
Yeah, hey, what's up?

49:09.465 --> 49:10.715
I just got some background

49:10.798 --> 49:13.132
for the story
I heard you had cookin'.

49:13.215 --> 49:16.007
That's right.
Yeah, I know Kendall Roy.

49:16.090 --> 49:19.423
And he's saying Logan's lost it.

49:19.506 --> 49:20.798
Yeah, that's right.

49:20.882 --> 49:22.757
Some board members
and senior management,

49:22.840 --> 49:24.548
they want him out.

49:24.631 --> 49:27.174
That's what I'm hearing from
people close to the family.

49:27.257 --> 49:28.631
Those disloyal fucks.

49:32.590 --> 49:35.465
Just-- Just say source
close to the family.

49:49.340 --> 49:51.340
- That's high.
- Too high.

49:51.423 --> 49:53.174
You're gonna be fine.
Relax, don't worry about it.

49:53.257 --> 49:54.882
- Yeah.

49:54.965 --> 49:56.381
Great, because I will give you

49:56.465 --> 49:59.631
one million dollars
if you hit a home run.

50:02.090 --> 50:04.215
Yes, for real.
A million dollars.

50:04.299 --> 50:06.882
Honey, where's the...
your bag?

50:06.965 --> 50:08.882
Hey, I'll do it for a million.
Give me that.

50:08.965 --> 50:11.423
Just kidding.
You're good.

50:11.506 --> 50:13.590
All right.

50:13.673 --> 50:15.715
I don't know why you're smiling.
I am dead serious.

50:15.798 --> 50:19.257
I will give you
one million dollars, cash,

50:19.340 --> 50:22.590
for a home fucking run.

50:22.673 --> 50:24.257
Rome,
don't be an asshole.

50:24.340 --> 50:25.840
I'm not being an asshole.
I want him incentivized.

50:25.923 --> 50:27.257
This is fun.

50:27.340 --> 50:29.757
It's a game. Jeez,
stop being so serious.

50:29.840 --> 50:31.257
Huh?

50:31.340 --> 50:33.049
Witnesses.

50:33.132 --> 50:35.049
Good luck. I believe in you.

50:36.673 --> 50:37.757
All right, let's do this!

50:37.840 --> 50:41.715
One million dollars.

50:43.840 --> 50:45.299
OK, come on.

50:48.965 --> 50:51.340
- That's it.
- Run, kid!

50:51.423 --> 50:53.340
Roman:
That's a hit.
That's a damn hit.

50:53.423 --> 50:55.715
Come on, Shiv!
I'm here, Shiv!

50:57.049 --> 50:59.132
- Come on!
- Roman: Tom!

50:59.215 --> 51:01.882
Come on!
Come on, run faster!

51:03.757 --> 51:07.548
- Roman: No! No!
-  Bad luck, kid.

51:07.631 --> 51:12.132
Oh, no! You were so damn close!

51:12.215 --> 51:13.840
That was so close!

51:13.923 --> 51:15.798
Oh, my goodness!

51:15.882 --> 51:19.132
Oh, that is so sad!
Oh, I'm sorry.

51:19.215 --> 51:21.590
I can't give it to you.
That would have counted,
by the way.

51:21.673 --> 51:23.631
That was almost a home run,
if you went all the way around.

51:23.715 --> 51:25.257
But it was
a really good effort.

51:25.340 --> 51:26.757
Really. Quite tremendous.

51:26.840 --> 51:28.506
So take this back to your life.

51:28.590 --> 51:31.299
It's a quarter million. Enjoy.

51:31.381 --> 51:35.381
Son...magnificent effort.

51:35.465 --> 51:37.090
- Thank you.
- Magnificent.

51:40.715 --> 51:43.299
- Come here.
- It's OK.

52:03.049 --> 52:04.465
Hey, Lawrence.

52:04.548 --> 52:06.882
Sorry the other offer
fell through.

52:06.965 --> 52:08.840
I don't know
what happened.

52:08.923 --> 52:11.257
But we fattened
the goose nice now, right?

52:11.340 --> 52:13.007
The number is 140.

52:13.090 --> 52:16.923
Cash, with
a stock alternative.

52:17.007 --> 52:19.049
You're on our board.

52:19.132 --> 52:21.090
Take the stock, you'll own
a nice piece of us.

52:21.174 --> 52:24.798
Well, that is
an appealing package.

52:24.882 --> 52:27.381
It is, yeah.
It's appealing.

52:27.465 --> 52:29.423
You better play nice, though.
Because I'm the whole company.

52:29.506 --> 52:31.340
Yeah, I think you're
gonna stick around

52:31.423 --> 52:33.049
because I'm gonna stuff
your mouth with so much money

52:33.132 --> 52:35.132
you're gonna shit
gold figurines.

52:35.215 --> 52:39.049
Non-disclosure agreement.
Non-voting shares.
Non-compete.

52:39.132 --> 52:43.174
I'm going to lock you
in a golden cage, fuck you
with a silver dildo,

52:43.257 --> 52:45.840
and pay you so much
you sing whatever song I want.

52:45.923 --> 52:49.090
- Easy. You still need me
to recommend this.
- No, I don't.

52:49.174 --> 52:51.840
This is a deal
so fucking good
you have to take it,

52:51.923 --> 52:54.340
or we'll see you in court.

52:54.423 --> 52:55.590
Dude.

53:11.465 --> 53:13.590
How you doing, sir?
How's everything?

53:13.673 --> 53:17.798
I'm Colin.
I work for Mr. Logan Roy
and the Roy family.

53:17.882 --> 53:22.174
We'd like to keep this quiet
today, if you'll agree to that.

53:22.257 --> 53:25.090
We'd like to have you sign
a non-disclosure agreement.

53:25.174 --> 53:28.132
- Oh, Frank. Yeah.

53:28.215 --> 53:30.506
I've been thinking

53:30.590 --> 53:35.840
if now isn't a time
for a new role for you.

53:37.506 --> 53:40.506
OK. As in what sort?

53:40.590 --> 53:42.840
Light duties.

53:44.965 --> 53:46.506
Light duties.

53:49.090 --> 53:52.215
Are you kidding me?
Logan. Me?

53:52.299 --> 53:56.423
There should be
a press release
on your phone.

53:56.506 --> 53:58.174
Proof it.

53:58.257 --> 54:01.548
You might want
to give it a bit of color,
it's quite dry.

54:09.049 --> 54:12.757
That's it
After 30--

54:12.840 --> 54:15.715
Jesus Christ. Here?

54:17.257 --> 54:21.465
You are what you do, Logan.
You know that?

54:21.548 --> 54:24.631
In the end,
you're just what you do.

54:24.715 --> 54:29.007
Don't worry,
you'll get your nut.

54:29.090 --> 54:30.174
Connor!

54:30.257 --> 54:33.299
Shiv! Roman!

54:33.381 --> 54:35.049
The other helicopter.

54:35.132 --> 54:37.965
Colin, see to it.

54:57.423 --> 55:01.715
Well, officially
the deadline has passed.

55:01.798 --> 55:04.965
So... what do you say, kids?

55:05.049 --> 55:07.381
What's the Frank situation?

55:07.465 --> 55:09.215
Frank's out of the picture.

55:09.299 --> 55:10.673
Yeah?

55:10.757 --> 55:14.007
Frank's dead.
Tom's stepping up,

55:14.090 --> 55:16.132
and Shiv's thinking
about a new role.

55:16.215 --> 55:18.965
So, are we good?

55:20.631 --> 55:22.257
Um... Shiv?

55:24.965 --> 55:26.673
Rome?

55:26.757 --> 55:27.798
Con?

55:29.548 --> 55:31.798
I'm with these two.
What they say goes.

55:34.798 --> 55:37.548
Our position is
this doesn't quite work for us.

55:37.631 --> 55:39.215
At present.

55:39.299 --> 55:40.715
You what?

55:40.798 --> 55:44.257
It's not
sufficiently attractive
as a proposition.

55:44.381 --> 55:45.882
Are you fuckin' joking?

55:45.965 --> 55:47.423
We get that. We do.

55:47.506 --> 55:49.631
And we would love to help.
I would love to help.

55:49.715 --> 55:50.965
Then help.

55:51.049 --> 55:53.715
But why would I
when I'm giving away power?

55:53.798 --> 55:55.049
Why would I do that?

55:55.132 --> 55:57.923
So...
so Kelly, uh...

55:58.007 --> 55:59.007
Who's Kelly?

55:59.090 --> 56:00.257
Kelly will set up some figures.

56:00.340 --> 56:02.548
He should see that, uh...

56:02.631 --> 56:03.798
Dad?

56:03.882 --> 56:05.548
- Yeah, he--

56:05.631 --> 56:08.174
- Roman: Dad, it's just
a first position.

56:08.257 --> 56:10.174
...get a grasp of what-- what--

56:11.840 --> 56:14.090
- Shiv: Dad! Dad!
- Roman: Dad!

56:17.465 --> 56:18.590
Dad!

56:18.673 --> 56:21.798
- Dad! Dad!
- Dad! Dad!

56:21.882 --> 56:26.299
Just, yeah. A hospital.
Take us to a hospital.

56:26.381 --> 56:27.673
OK, yeah, now!

56:27.757 --> 56:29.381
Has he fainted?

56:29.465 --> 56:32.340
He's hot.
- He's really hot. I don't know.

56:49.965 --> 56:52.757
- Yeah.

56:52.840 --> 56:54.798
Have you heard the news?

56:54.882 --> 56:57.381
What?

57:00.715 --> 57:02.299
Deal.

57:02.381 --> 57:03.840
It's all very exciting.
I can't wait to--

57:03.923 --> 57:05.090
- Yeah.

57:07.049 --> 57:08.965
Oh, dude.

57:09.049 --> 57:10.673
Listen, I think...

57:10.757 --> 57:12.923
I think you've made
a really great decision

57:13.007 --> 57:16.673
and I hope there's
no hard feelings over
all the shit-talking.

57:16.757 --> 57:18.381
Oh, no, no,
it's cool.

57:18.465 --> 57:20.174
It's cool.

57:20.257 --> 57:23.215
So, the news
I was talking about

57:23.299 --> 57:26.423
is that your dad just
had a brain hemorrhage.

57:28.215 --> 57:29.673
What?

57:29.757 --> 57:32.673
Yeah. I'm so sorry.

57:32.757 --> 57:34.340
- Are you--
- But...

57:34.423 --> 57:37.548
you just invited me
into the chicken coop.

57:37.631 --> 57:39.631
And without Daddy around
to protect you,

57:39.715 --> 57:41.299
I'm gonna eat you all.

57:41.381 --> 57:43.257
One by fucking one.

57:55.465 --> 57:56.715
Hello?

57:56.798 --> 57:58.882
Siobhan:
Kendall. Thank God.

57:58.965 --> 58:01.049
We've been trying
to reach you. Um...

58:01.132 --> 58:02.465
Uh-huh.

58:02.548 --> 58:04.715
...Dad is in the hospital.

58:04.798 --> 58:06.381
He's...

58:06.465 --> 58:09.465
We were in the helicopter,
and we got here really fast,

58:09.548 --> 58:11.715
- but they think--
- Uh-huh.

58:11.798 --> 58:13.590
We don't know.
They think he's had
a brain hemorrhage.

58:20.049 --> 58:22.465
If you could get here
really soon,

58:22.548 --> 58:24.923
that'd be good.

58:25.007 --> 58:27.423
I'm sorry.

58:27.506 --> 58:28.506
Um...

59:10.965 --> 59:13.882
Most first-time homebuyers
would love to live
in Newport Beach.

59:13.965 --> 59:16.965
But average home price
in Newport Beach
is over $1 million.

59:17.049 --> 59:20.215
So, most of the homes...

59:43.381 --> 59:45.132
Anchor: There is a degree
of stock market volatility

59:45.215 --> 59:48.299
As Waystar Royco's chairman
is reported to be

59:48.381 --> 59:49.798
in critical condition

59:49.882 --> 59:51.965
following a major
medical incident...

1:01:13.257 --> 1:01:14.174
KENDALL ROY: Richie, I see you.

1:01:14.257 --> 1:01:15.631
We need to know
what's happening.

1:01:16.381 --> 1:01:17.465
We have no clue
what's going on?

1:01:17.548 --> 1:01:19.340
According to this,
it sounds like a stroke.

1:01:19.423 --> 1:01:21.423
Great. Get in there
and operate, Dr. Google.

1:01:21.673 --> 1:01:25.381
The board has a plan in the
event of Logan's incapacitation.

1:01:25.715 --> 1:01:27.798
KENDALL: They could take
the company out of our hands,

1:01:27.882 --> 1:01:29.007
and we'd never
get near it again.

1:01:29.673 --> 1:01:31.923
The plan is to announce
that I take over.

1:01:32.007 --> 1:01:33.757
I'm not doing anything
without my lawyer present.

1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:36.506
I'm not saying I would make
a better CEO, that's unsaid.

1:01:36.590 --> 1:01:38.049
It's not unsaid when you say it.

1:01:38.381 --> 1:01:39.840
There's a huge problem.

1:01:39.923 --> 1:01:41.631
Hey, uh, they have the results.

1:01:43.840 --> 1:01:44.965
Don't jump.
