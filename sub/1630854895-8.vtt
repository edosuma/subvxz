02:26.896 --> 02:27.981
I mean, like,

02:27.981 --> 02:31.192
even after he was down,
John B was still hitting him.

02:31.192 --> 02:32.819
Yeah, I've never seen him like that.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.737
You actually think
he's gonna get arrested?

02:34.737 --> 02:36.197
He can't get arrested.

02:36.739 --> 02:37.782
Not now.

02:37.782 --> 02:41.369
If he's locked up, he can't help his dad.
I have to fix this.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.705
Can you give me a ride
to Topper's? Please.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.583
You don't think
this plan could make things worse?

02:46.583 --> 02:47.625
I don't know.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.587
And I don't know
what's gonna happen with me and John B.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.297
But what I do know is I can't just sit by

02:52.297 --> 02:54.799
and watch him get arrested
while his dad's abducted.

02:56.467 --> 02:57.385
I have to try.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.404
It's something about the dude's face,
you know?

03:16.404 --> 03:19.657
Like the whole, "No hard feelings, bro."
You know what I'm saying?

03:19.657 --> 03:23.077
"No hard feelings." It's kinda hard
not to have hard feelings about that.

03:23.077 --> 03:26.414
It's just that... that look.
That Kook look, you know?

03:26.414 --> 03:28.541
- It was clear "provucation."
- Provocation.

03:28.541 --> 03:32.337
Provocation, and, uh, I mean,
you had to do what you had to do.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.379
No choice about it.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.465
Thank you. No choice.
We gotta figure out a plan

03:35.465 --> 03:37.383
to get to South America, like, yesterday.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.969
- They've got my dad.
- You have any food real quick, though?

03:39.969 --> 03:41.930
So I was thinking passports.
We don't have those.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.182
Therefore, we can't fly commercial.
We need other ideas.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.643
Okay, well, don't you got the money
that you took from Portis?

03:46.643 --> 03:48.853
- I gave that to my dad.
- So then what about a boat?

03:49.771 --> 03:52.273
If we got a boat, maybe
we could get down there 'cause the HMS...

03:52.273 --> 03:55.443
Yeah, you know about the HMS.
Oh, Limbrey! Limbrey has a boat!

03:55.443 --> 03:57.862
- What if we took that one down?
- Yeah. She took that back.

03:57.862 --> 04:01.074
And the HMS is not gonna make it down
to the Port of Spain, so out on the boats.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.659
So what you're saying is,

04:03.201 --> 04:04.661
we don't got any money,

04:04.661 --> 04:07.205
and we also don't have a boat
that can make it to South America.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.164
- Great.
- Unbelievable.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.250
Actually, I might know a guy.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.001
I'm onto something!

04:12.835 --> 04:15.630
-  Uh-oh.
- You don't start with, "Uh-oh," dude.

04:15.630 --> 04:19.259
- You're so negative.
- Get down! Shoupe is out front right now!

04:21.678 --> 04:22.971
All right, John B!

04:22.971 --> 04:23.972
- Shit!
- Come on.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.141
Yoo-hoo! Anybody home?

04:27.767 --> 04:30.144
- John B!
- Go under there. Under there.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.064
- Shit.
- Come on. Scoot!

04:33.064 --> 04:35.400
All right, John B, I know you're in there.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.153
Shut up. Shut up.

04:42.156 --> 04:44.409
If he sees you, that's game over.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.536
- I know, okay, JJ?
-  Don't get that.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.288
I know you can hear me in there.

04:48.955 --> 04:52.250
You need to come out and talk to me.
It'll be a whole lot worse if you don't.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.004
Okay.

05:15.481 --> 05:16.399
Okey doke,

05:17.233 --> 05:18.318
have it your way!

05:19.027 --> 05:21.029
You know where you can find me.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.160
All right, let's peel!

05:28.077 --> 05:30.413
- Come on. Go.
- All right. I got a plan, all right?

05:30.413 --> 05:31.664
I think it might work.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.917
It's a little sketchy. Might not like it,
but I think it will work.

05:34.917 --> 05:37.420
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait. What plan?

05:37.420 --> 05:40.340
If I tell you now when the plan
is half-baked, you'll get all negative.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.216
Look, I'd settle for a quarter-baked plan.

05:42.216 --> 05:44.552
-  Come on!
- Don't you dare make that noise at me.

05:48.890 --> 05:49.891
Hey.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.143
Hey.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.438
So is this place really all yours?

05:56.022 --> 05:57.982
More like lord of the manor shit.

06:06.574 --> 06:07.992
Ooh!

06:15.708 --> 06:18.044
<i>It's either you
or your pops, Rafe.</i>

06:18.044 --> 06:21.506
If I was you, I would move
to get him off the battlefield

06:21.506 --> 06:23.007
before he starts squawking.

06:27.678 --> 06:29.722
- Hey, you're the man, Rafe.
- Hey.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.058
I'm gonna stay that way too.

06:44.654 --> 06:45.988
Hey, are you going somewhere?

06:46.781 --> 06:48.324
Um, yeah. Uh...

06:50.284 --> 06:53.371
I've got some business to take care of,
but you can hang out here, all right?

06:53.371 --> 06:54.705
I'll... I'll be back.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.921
I'm taking care
of the business, all right?

07:01.921 --> 07:04.090
I'm laying groundwork.
I'm making connections.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.342
I'm trying to plant my flag here. Okay?

07:06.342 --> 07:10.221
So you just need to go back
to your island where it's safe,

07:10.221 --> 07:12.849
and you need to stop jamming me up, okay?

07:12.849 --> 07:15.726
If you get caught here,
it ruins everything.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.897
I'd figured you'd know
where to find me here, of all people.

07:20.481 --> 07:21.899
I'm glad you did.

07:21.899 --> 07:24.569
I think it's clear
from what happened yesterday...

07:27.363 --> 07:28.364
I was right.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.367
You're on a very bad path, Rafe.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.911
Your opinion, not mine. Okay? I'm good.

07:33.911 --> 07:36.581
You're making
the same mistakes again and again,

07:36.581 --> 07:38.082
the same ones I did, okay?

07:38.082 --> 07:40.626
-  Right.
- So I'm gonna help you, son.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.545
I decided to make some changes.

07:44.505 --> 07:45.506
What are those?

07:47.216 --> 07:49.427
I'm taking control
of the company away from you.

07:52.346 --> 07:53.222
What?

07:54.098 --> 07:56.309
You're not in charge anymore, Rafe.

07:58.352 --> 07:59.562
What are you saying?

08:00.396 --> 08:03.399
My attorneys found a more recent document

08:03.983 --> 08:05.526
that left control to Rose.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.363
- Rose?
-  Yeah.

08:09.363 --> 08:12.575
You didn't think I was gonna give up
complete control, did you, Rafe?

08:13.784 --> 08:16.037
Not be able
to tap the rudder a little bit?

08:17.121 --> 08:19.290
- I'm very generous with my children.
- Oh, are you?

08:19.290 --> 08:21.501
- But I'm not a complete fool.
-  No, of course not.

08:21.501 --> 08:26.047
It's clear to me you're in over your head,
so control goes to Rose.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.634
- And we're cutting your stipend.

08:29.634 --> 08:30.927
We're selling Tannyhill,

08:31.511 --> 08:33.638
and I need you out of there
by the end of the week.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.473
Okay. Um...

08:35.473 --> 08:38.351
And I know that's hard, son.
It's hard letting go of this old life,

08:38.351 --> 08:40.019
but that is exactly what you have to do,

08:40.019 --> 08:42.563
because we are starting a brand-new life.

08:43.689 --> 08:45.191
We're gonna be reborn.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.569
Right, but to do that,
we have to let this life go.

08:48.569 --> 08:49.612
We have to bury it.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.405
Reborn, reborn, reborn!

08:51.405 --> 08:53.491
- Are you for real right now?
- Yeah.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.911
Friar Cameron. You can't stand
that I'm on my own right now!

08:56.911 --> 08:57.995
That I have the power!

08:58.621 --> 09:00.164
Do you, Rafe?

09:01.290 --> 09:02.291
Do you have the power?

09:05.545 --> 09:07.630
I mean, I'll tell the police you're here.

09:08.297 --> 09:10.091
- That you're alive.
- Yeah?

09:11.842 --> 09:12.718
So...

09:14.720 --> 09:16.180
I think I have some power.

09:18.849 --> 09:24.188
Wow, I guess I'd have to tell them
that you killed Sheriff Peterkin.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.777
I mean, I wouldn't want to, but...

09:31.779 --> 09:33.906
in the end, it actually might be
the good thing for you.

09:33.906 --> 09:36.200
- Hmm.
- To face up to some of these things.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.120
I think they would go easy on you.
I mean, Sarah would back me up, right?

09:39.120 --> 09:40.204
She was there.

09:41.455 --> 09:42.623
Have you seen her?

09:43.207 --> 09:44.834
- Of course I've seen her.
-  Right.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.085
She's my daughter.

09:46.877 --> 09:49.171
I offered her some money
and a place to stay but--

09:58.264 --> 09:59.140
Rafe.

10:00.725 --> 10:01.726
See?

10:03.144 --> 10:04.645
The devil's got you, son.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.611
You want to shoot me?

10:15.948 --> 10:17.283
You can't, son.

10:19.660 --> 10:23.331
Because as angry as you are,
I am your father, and you love me.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.669
Some derelict named John B.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.670
He hit him

11:10.670 --> 11:13.422
and hit him even after he was unconscious.

11:13.422 --> 11:14.840
Can you believe that?

11:14.840 --> 11:18.386
Thank God the CT scan
and the BTI both came back negative.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.305
Oh.

11:21.305 --> 11:22.640
Let me call you back.

11:26.060 --> 11:29.563
Dr. Thornton, I am so, so sorry.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.858
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
apologies won't heal my son, will they?

11:33.567 --> 11:34.485
No.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.114
Can I please see him?

11:43.327 --> 11:44.161
Go on.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.670
Okay, hey.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.005
Shouldn't you be taking it easy?

11:56.048 --> 11:57.591
-  Topper!

12:01.512 --> 12:06.016
You know I could have beat his ass, right?
I mean, I've done it, what? Twice already?

12:06.600 --> 12:11.105
But, you know, took the high road.
Didn't want to ruin Mike and Anna's party.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.691
- And you did the right thing.
-  I did do the right thing.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.402
But now I look like
I couldn't even take the guy, so...

12:16.902 --> 12:21.449
Unfortunately for John B,
I'm gonna have to get even.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.200
Topper, I am sorry.

12:24.326 --> 12:26.704
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

12:27.204 --> 12:30.040
All right,
if you're really, truly sorry, Sarah...

12:32.001 --> 12:34.086
...how about you go in
and testify against him?

12:36.338 --> 12:38.090
Would you do that for me?

12:41.594 --> 12:43.220
So you're really pressing charges?

12:43.220 --> 12:46.056
Yeah, I'm really pressing charges.
I mean, did you see what happened?

12:46.932 --> 12:49.143
The guy just sucker punched me

12:49.143 --> 12:51.228
then kept hitting me
when I'm out cold on the floor.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.855
I know. Uh...

12:53.564 --> 12:55.566
We're going in this afternoon.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.485
You saw the whole thing.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.237
Would you come with us
and do right by my son?

13:05.951 --> 13:06.869
Sure.

13:09.538 --> 13:10.456
Yeah?

13:10.456 --> 13:11.749
I'll meet you there.

13:38.651 --> 13:42.363
Oh, perfect. Rockfish. The place you go
to bash beer bottles on people's heads.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.073
There's a guy here,

13:44.073 --> 13:45.533
that's always here,

13:45.533 --> 13:46.992
moves a lot of weight.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.744
My dad worked for him.

13:48.744 --> 13:49.829
Come on now.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.372
No, no, wait, wait.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.918
- Please don't say "Barracuda Mike."
- Okay, I won't.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.254
Come on, there's gotta be
a better option than this.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.798
Oh, you know what? You're right.
There is a better option.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.591
Except there's not. All right, dude?

14:02.591 --> 14:04.802
Seriously, we don't have
a whole lot of time,

14:04.802 --> 14:08.055
and your dad needs help right now,
and this guy is gonna be the key

14:08.055 --> 14:10.057
to getting down to South America ASAP.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.225
Trust me on this one.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.769
Let me do the talking, okay?

14:15.104 --> 14:18.482
Yo, Mike!
Yo! [chuckles] You remember me, right?

14:18.482 --> 14:21.819
- It's on the tip of your tongue. J--
- Luke's son!

14:21.819 --> 14:23.112
That works too.

14:23.112 --> 14:27.324
Uh, also go by JJ,
but this here is my good friend, John B.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.868
- Hey.
- Routledge!

14:28.868 --> 14:31.662
- In the flesh. Yep.
- Heard stories about you two.

14:31.662 --> 14:35.291
-  Uh-oh.
- I mean, he's a stone-cold cop k... killer.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.208
No, I'm not.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.628
Mike, I'm gonna be honest
about why we're here, okay?

14:39.628 --> 14:42.131
We're a little bit
in a... a patch of trouble,

14:42.131 --> 14:44.633
and we're trying to get down
to South America if that's--

14:44.633 --> 14:48.178
I'm sorry, slick,
but I done sold the travel agency.

14:49.680 --> 14:53.642
Well, I mean, we're not looking
for some free handout here, all right?

14:53.642 --> 14:55.269
We understand it's a two-way road.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.896
- Symbiotic relationship.
- Yes, yes.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.523
That's what we're trying to get at.
We just need to "parlee"--

14:59.523 --> 15:01.692
Parley. Parley is what he's saying.

15:01.692 --> 15:04.403
Parley in, um... in private,

15:04.403 --> 15:05.905
if that's cool with you.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.826
- Just stay here.
- No, you're not gonna do this.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.202
You're not gonna leave me here.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.246
Excuse you! All right.

15:18.626 --> 15:22.129
Look, I know you got planes coming in
with bales of weed from South America,

15:22.129 --> 15:24.048
and they need to be unloaded, right?

15:24.048 --> 15:27.801
That's what my dad did for you.
And I can do the same thing, Mike.

15:28.719 --> 15:29.637
He would come home

15:29.637 --> 15:32.723
and brag about how much he made
in one night, which was 10K, right?

15:32.723 --> 15:36.018
That's a lot of cheddar.
We're willing to do it for way cheaper.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.645
All right? Like... like free.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.230
Nothing's free.

15:40.230 --> 15:43.943
I live by that one too. All right?
So I'll be honest.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.904
All we want is
just a little space in the cargo hold

15:46.904 --> 15:48.781
when you make your next trip down there.

15:48.781 --> 15:52.284
- You just want a ride.
- Just want a ride in that cargo hold.

15:52.284 --> 15:55.412
And then in exchange,
you get two sets of free hands

15:55.412 --> 15:57.331
and another 20K in your pocket.

15:57.331 --> 16:00.417
I don't know about you, but that sounds
pretty damn free to me.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.502
What do you say?

16:02.962 --> 16:05.798
Yeah, so, uh, what do you...
what do you guys catch out here?

16:05.798 --> 16:06.799
Money.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.803
-  5:30.
- 5:30 tonight. We'll be there. Yes, sir.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.888
- Nice to meet you fellas.
- Hey, let's go. Come on.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.600
- Okay. What do we gotta do?
- Just a little something.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.893
- A little something?
- Yeah.

16:17.893 --> 16:21.355
Every time you say "a little something,"
it's never a little something.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.108
All right, it's literally the easiest job
in the world, bro.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.486
We just unload it.
You know what they do on planes?

16:27.486 --> 16:30.489
You know on Delta and United
when they take the bags off of the--

16:30.489 --> 16:32.199
That's what we're doing. Okay?

16:32.783 --> 16:35.285
Once we do that, we punch our tickets,
go on to South America,

16:35.285 --> 16:37.204
sipping on piña coladas, all right?

16:37.204 --> 16:40.249
John B, it's gonna be a piece of cake.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.585
- You're driving.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.800
 Finally, the Orinoco, John.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.635
The gateway to El Dorado.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.722
A graveyard of empires.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.599
Many have died, you know?

17:00.936 --> 17:02.688
Perhaps we add a few more to the list.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.483
Say hello to our new river guide, John.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.528
It's four days
until the solstice, you know,

17:10.029 --> 17:12.740
and on that night,
you'll be a part of history.

17:17.703 --> 17:18.620
I mean,

17:19.621 --> 17:22.750
we know this is some sort
of translation key, right?

17:23.292 --> 17:26.211
I don't get it. I mean, look.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.380
This is the sun,

17:28.380 --> 17:32.342
and that's the glyph for sun,
and this is gold,

17:32.342 --> 17:36.513
and that's the glyph for gold,
but it's not like a dictionary.

17:36.513 --> 17:38.474
Don't you get the feeling like

17:39.391 --> 17:41.685
if you were to put it together
in the right order,

17:41.685 --> 17:43.270
it'd mean something specific?

17:43.270 --> 17:44.855
Wait a second.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.857
I've seen this somewhere before.

17:47.900 --> 17:48.776
Sun.

17:49.443 --> 17:50.861
Sun, sun, sun, sun.

17:51.612 --> 17:54.114
You know the part that I can't understand?

17:54.615 --> 17:58.243
This man had one opportunity
to send a letter to his daughter,

17:58.994 --> 18:00.829
and he sends this mishmash?

18:01.413 --> 18:04.124
Think about it. A translation of Kalinago?

18:04.124 --> 18:05.876
There must've been a reason.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.544
It's inheritance.

18:07.544 --> 18:10.130
Cleo, that's it.

18:10.130 --> 18:12.132
He wanted her to find El Dorado.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.848
- Um, we gotta check this out.
- Yeah, we should do that.

18:19.848 --> 18:21.892
I think I know exactly
where we need to go.

18:22.559 --> 18:24.228
Wait, your dad's staying here?

18:24.228 --> 18:25.938
It's where I'd stay if I were him.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.981
Are you sure you want to do this?

18:29.399 --> 18:31.985
I don't know,
but I gotta help John B and his dad.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.363
Yeah, if I hear bloodcurdling screams,

18:34.363 --> 18:36.907
I'll make sure to go in
and document the crime scene.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.700
You're the best.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.328
Hey, good luck.

18:59.054 --> 19:00.097
Hey, sweetie.

19:05.769 --> 19:07.146
I prayed you'd come around.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.652
Do you remember you told me

19:13.652 --> 19:15.320
you would do anything

19:15.320 --> 19:17.030
to repair our relationship?

19:18.782 --> 19:19.741
Of course.

19:20.701 --> 19:21.743
I meant it.

19:23.203 --> 19:24.913
There's something you can do.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.374
Anything.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.752
I... I don't know about this.

19:30.752 --> 19:33.213
Bro, you're worrying
way too much about this, okay?

19:33.213 --> 19:36.425
It is just farmers who brought
organic seeds from South America

19:36.425 --> 19:37.718
that we are gonna unload.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.512
- It's a drug-smuggling operation.
- Do you wanna get your dad or not?

19:40.512 --> 19:43.849
Yes, I do! Okay?
Look, this has to work out, all right?

19:43.849 --> 19:45.684
I doubted him, and I blamed him.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.020
And all this time,
he was just trying to protect me.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.355
And now he's been abducted,
so I kinda need a bit of a--

19:50.355 --> 19:52.649
John B, no! Okay, listen, listen. I know.

19:52.649 --> 19:55.736
You know who you're gonna have
to trust right now? Papa J.

19:56.236 --> 19:59.198
Okay? I got this, 100%.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.283
I mean, 60% would be good, honestly.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.454
- Holy shit, look at that thing.
- Yeah, dude. It's like an RV with wings.

20:08.081 --> 20:10.709
- Shit, they're already unloading.
-  Oh shit.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.754
Yo! We aren't late, are we?

20:13.754 --> 20:17.049
No, there was a change of plan though.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.093
Oh, uh, okay.

20:20.093 --> 20:24.431
You two are gonna drive the truck
up to Elizabeth City to make the drop.

20:24.431 --> 20:25.891
The address is in the truck.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.644
There'll be a dummy car
for you to use to come back.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.562
The plane'll still be waiting.

20:30.562 --> 20:34.233
Right. Okay, so, um...
you just want us to drive the truck?

20:34.733 --> 20:35.734
Correct.

20:39.529 --> 20:41.865
Actually, can I borrow him for one second?

20:42.491 --> 20:44.660
Hey, hey,
this is not what we talked about.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.119
This is way more dangerous.

20:46.119 --> 20:49.790
It don't matter what we talked about.
In for a penny, in for a pound.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.167
- You do this, you get your ride.
- Yeah, it's just that--

20:52.167 --> 20:53.168
If not,

20:54.670 --> 20:57.005
you know how this works, right?

21:03.637 --> 21:06.556
Now, Highway Patrol is changing shifts
as we speak.

21:06.556 --> 21:09.601
This is the window.
Take it to the drop house on Prospect.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.061
Directions are in the truck.

21:11.061 --> 21:13.647
Any luck, we'll have you back
before sundown.

21:13.647 --> 21:14.940
Come on.

21:17.567 --> 21:18.568
Take the key.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.907
Yeah, no problem. Get in the truck.

21:31.206 --> 21:34.501
-  Any idea what's in the back?
- Yes, John B, I know what's in the back.

21:34.501 --> 21:36.753
And it's gonna be fine.
It's gonna work out. Okay?

21:36.753 --> 21:39.172
- I am sick of your bullshit plans, man.
- Goddamn!

21:39.172 --> 21:41.133
No, I'm just saying
this might top the time

21:41.133 --> 21:42.801
you told me to fake appendicitis in jail.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.052
And that almost worked.

21:44.761 --> 21:47.556
Get the map out.
I have no idea where I'm going.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.267
All right, we need to get to 158, okay?

21:50.267 --> 21:52.352
- Just give--
- This one, man. You just ripped it out.

21:52.352 --> 21:53.520
Jesus Christ.

21:54.396 --> 21:57.858
- There it is. It's gonna be a nice--
- Cop. JJ, JJ, there's a cop.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.070
- Shit.
- Okay, play it cool.

22:02.070 --> 22:04.156
- No, you're not cool.
- Play it cool. I'm super cool.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.199
- I'm super cool.
-  I'm as cool as it gets.

22:06.199 --> 22:09.119
- What are you doing? Don't do that.
- I'm just gonna wave.

22:09.870 --> 22:12.372
- JJ? What are-- I told you--
- Hi, officer.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.585
- Why'd you touch me?
- Don't wave at cops!

22:16.585 --> 22:18.795
Rule number one of driving a U-Haul!

22:19.880 --> 22:22.549
- We've been in the car for five minutes.
-  He's getting in.

22:22.549 --> 22:25.802
- Okay, okay. Just act very, very calm.

22:25.802 --> 22:28.513
Shit, he's coming!
He's coming! Shit! Damn it!

22:28.513 --> 22:31.016
Dude, goblin mode, all right?
We gotta lose him, okay?

22:31.016 --> 22:34.186
- Goblin mode? What's that even mean, JJ?
- That's what we gotta do! Hang on!

22:34.186 --> 22:35.604
- I got this!
- JJ.

22:41.234 --> 22:43.028
-  Get out! Go, go, go!
-  Okay.

22:43.028 --> 22:45.697
I swear to God, if we get through this,
I'm gonna kill you!

22:45.697 --> 22:48.367
You probably won't have to
because Barracuda Mike will first.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.211
Pizarro.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.921
Sir Walter Raleigh.

23:01.755 --> 23:04.841
They also came up this river,
you know, John, hmm?

23:05.509 --> 23:07.844
And they had the fever,
you know, as we do,

23:08.470 --> 23:12.724
that set army upon army
and atrocities beyond description.

23:12.724 --> 23:17.938
And all of that killing, John,
for something only rumored to exist.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.899
Something no one ever found.

23:21.858 --> 23:25.779
My grandfather,
he died on that ship, you know, John?

23:25.779 --> 23:27.781
As did many others.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.866
And for what, hmm?

23:29.866 --> 23:31.410
For what? For nothing.

23:31.993 --> 23:32.911
They failed.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.955
You murdered my friend.

23:35.539 --> 23:36.415
Why?

23:36.415 --> 23:39.167
So your grandfather
wouldn't have died in vain

23:39.167 --> 23:40.752
over 100 years ago?

23:40.752 --> 23:41.962
That is correct.

23:42.879 --> 23:44.756
And what about you, hmm?

23:45.882 --> 23:48.468
You had the fever a long time, you know.

23:48.468 --> 23:50.846
You sacrificed
a promising academic career.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.597
Yet you went on. Why?

23:55.767 --> 23:57.185
For the kid, I guess.

23:59.104 --> 24:03.191
<i>It was something we did together.
I didn't care what others thought of me.</i>

24:03.191 --> 24:06.069
<i>I just wanted him to know</i>

24:06.069 --> 24:07.529
that I...

24:09.948 --> 24:11.283
That I wasn't nothing.

24:14.494 --> 24:17.247
We're not all that different,
you and me, John.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.667
We're not that different, you know.

24:22.878 --> 24:26.465
Listen, I've been going through it
over and over and over again. Okay?

24:26.465 --> 24:30.469
You said it yourself, right? The only way
this thing goes south is my dad.

24:31.219 --> 24:34.514
We gotta nip that shit in the bud.
We gotta take him out.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.475
And anyway, who's gonna know?

24:36.475 --> 24:39.269
He's already dead. You can't kill
someone who's already dead.

24:41.438 --> 24:45.275
Hey, if my pop stays here, all right,

24:45.275 --> 24:46.318
our deal,

24:47.319 --> 24:50.030
us doing business together,
using the company to launder the money,

24:50.030 --> 24:51.615
all that fifty-fifty shit...

24:51.615 --> 24:53.825
-  Mm-hmm.
- ...all that's gone.

24:53.825 --> 24:58.246
What you're asking me right now
is something that once it's done,

25:00.081 --> 25:01.958
cannot be undone.

25:02.959 --> 25:04.294
There's no going back.

25:05.420 --> 25:08.757
I'm talking about your family, talking
about your pops, talking about your blood.

25:09.799 --> 25:11.551
And blood complicates things.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.887
Hypothetically speaking,

25:14.513 --> 25:15.514
let's say

25:16.389 --> 25:17.224
I do it.

25:18.433 --> 25:19.935
And then, for whatever reason,

25:20.936 --> 25:23.396
you decide to change your mind.

25:24.397 --> 25:25.398
Sell me out.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.278
No.

25:32.322 --> 25:35.283
Yeah, this has been a long time coming.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.877
He's always had his boot on my neck.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.298
Holding me down.

25:54.177 --> 25:55.971
That's all gonna be over soon.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.563
I'm not changing my mind.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.912
My dad is somewhere
in South America right now,

26:20.912 --> 26:23.707
probably with a knife to his throat,
and what are we doing?

26:23.707 --> 26:24.874
Moving weight?

26:25.917 --> 26:26.751
In goblin mode?

26:26.751 --> 26:30.088
How many times will you complain
about me trying to help save your dad?

26:30.088 --> 26:33.133
Help is the exact opposite
of what you're doing right now!

26:33.133 --> 26:34.593
You know what? You're right.

26:35.468 --> 26:36.970
You're absolutely right.

26:36.970 --> 26:40.640
But you know whose fault that is?
You and your treasure-obsessed father.

26:43.226 --> 26:44.477
Oh, okay!

26:44.477 --> 26:46.771
- That's where we're going?
- That's where we're going.

26:46.771 --> 26:49.441
Yeah. And it looks
like we just went there too!

26:49.441 --> 26:50.734
- Come on.
- Come on, man!

26:50.734 --> 26:53.153
That's it! I've been waiting for this!

26:55.196 --> 26:57.782
-  Get off me!

26:57.782 --> 26:58.742
Howdy, boys!

27:01.453 --> 27:02.537
Uh...

27:02.537 --> 27:04.414
-  'Sup, Shoupe?
- You boys okay?

27:04.414 --> 27:06.791
Yeah, we're, uh, you know, just, um...

27:07.459 --> 27:08.460
We're... we're good.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.755
Tracker.

27:11.755 --> 27:14.549
Makes it a lot easier
to keep an eye on you hoodlums.

27:14.549 --> 27:18.136
<i>All units, evidence team is
en route to the abandoned U-Haul. Over.</i>

27:18.720 --> 27:20.305
- Copy that.
- Sounds like duty calls.

27:20.305 --> 27:22.641
- So we wouldn't want to hold you up.
- Yeah.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.808
We'll get out of your hair.

27:23.808 --> 27:27.145
Hold on a minute.
We just found a U-Haul full of drugs

27:27.145 --> 27:30.815
out near 158. Y'all wouldn't happen
to be involved in that, would you?

27:31.941 --> 27:34.277
- You see that? That's profiling, John B.
- I know.

27:34.277 --> 27:35.904
And I really don't appreciate it.

27:35.904 --> 27:38.448
Just 'cause we're Pogues,
you think we're drug dealers? No, no!

27:38.448 --> 27:40.241
We're not that desperate now, Shoupe.

27:40.241 --> 27:43.495
You've been too busy beating people up
and breaking up parties.

27:43.495 --> 27:47.123
- Okay, Shoupe, there's an explanation--
- I hate to break it to you, kid.

27:47.123 --> 27:49.376
- But I've got a warrant.
- What? A warrant?

27:49.376 --> 27:51.086
- Topper's pressing charges.
-  Hold up.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.921
For what? No, he started it!

27:52.921 --> 27:55.632
- He did start it.
- I'm just being honest with you.

27:55.632 --> 27:59.094
- Honestly, what did I do?
- Hands up against the van.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.388
Shoupe, this time,
I didn't even do anything, okay?

28:01.388 --> 28:05.934
- Do you know what Topper did to John B?
- No, but I know what your boy here did.

28:05.934 --> 28:09.270
- He beat him in front of the whole town.
- Yeah, which is--

28:09.270 --> 28:11.189
And kept beatin' him after he was down,

28:11.189 --> 28:14.192
and Topper may be a douche,
but you know better than that.

28:14.192 --> 28:17.862
Shoupe! Come on, he was messing
with John B's girl. You'd do the same.

28:17.862 --> 28:21.116
Shoupe, I get it, okay?
But I can't be locked up right now.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.326
Well, you should've thought
of that beforehand.

28:23.326 --> 28:25.704
Come on, man. We're doing this again?

28:25.704 --> 28:28.331
- I don't have time for this.
-  Come on.

28:28.331 --> 28:30.625
- JJ, please.
- He didn't do shit too.

28:30.625 --> 28:34.295
- You know!
- You stay safe and stay outta trouble.

28:40.093 --> 28:41.177
Hey, John B.

28:41.177 --> 28:43.680
- Listen, we're gonna fix it.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.516
We're gonna get down to South America
and save your dad.

28:46.516 --> 28:49.561
- I promise. Okay?
-  Back it up, buddy. We got to go.

28:49.561 --> 28:52.731
You'll be fine. I'll figure it out.
We'll save your dad. Okay?

28:52.731 --> 28:54.983
You hear me, John B? We're gonna get him!

28:58.403 --> 29:00.488
I thought we were past this.

29:00.488 --> 29:02.699
Kiara, it's similar
to what you've been doing.

29:02.699 --> 29:04.451
It's not having to sit
at a desk every day.

29:04.451 --> 29:07.662
- She's painting rocks.
- Okay, so yes, not this one.

29:07.662 --> 29:10.248
But look at this one, please.
All wilderness activity stuff.

29:10.248 --> 29:13.251
This is what you've been doing.
It just has structure and safety to it.

29:13.251 --> 29:17.088
Listen, if you wanna go across the ocean,
you first have to build a boat. Okay?

29:17.088 --> 29:19.090
And you haven't built the boat yet, Kiara.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.134
You haven't put in
the groundwork that's needed.

29:21.134 --> 29:24.387
Without that, you're not going anywhere.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

29:24.387 --> 29:27.682
All your dad is trying to say is
that we need there to be a plan

29:27.682 --> 29:29.809
in place for your safety, that's all.

29:29.809 --> 29:33.229
I get it, and if I were you guys,
I'd be wondering the same thing.

29:33.730 --> 29:37.901
I was gone for weeks. I haven't gone back
to school yet, and I keep delaying, but...

29:37.901 --> 29:40.695
...so much has happened.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.865
Like, I... I was abducted.
I thought I was gonna die!

29:43.865 --> 29:45.950
Like, so much has changed! I...

29:45.950 --> 29:49.204
I really understand
what you guys want from me.

29:49.954 --> 29:52.582
I'm just not into school right now.

29:53.708 --> 29:57.545
And I'm really, really not
into going away for school.

29:57.545 --> 29:59.422
-  Okay.

30:01.424 --> 30:03.051
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Carrera.

30:05.386 --> 30:07.680
- Uh, I'm gonna get that.
- Kiara.

30:07.680 --> 30:08.681
Come back.

30:09.182 --> 30:10.433
Guys, what's up?

30:10.433 --> 30:12.519
Now is not a good time.

30:12.519 --> 30:15.104
My parents are
on a literal warpath about my future.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.648
This'll only take a second.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.691
Do you still have
that picture you took at Singh's?

30:18.691 --> 30:20.902
- The one of the painting?
- Yeah, obviously.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.862
Thank you.

30:22.862 --> 30:24.072
That was rude.

30:24.072 --> 30:27.659
- You know she's totally lost it, right?
- Push her away, we'll lose her entirely.

30:28.576 --> 30:31.412
- What are you even looking for?
-  Something Cleo found, actually.

30:31.412 --> 30:32.413
Okay.

30:32.413 --> 30:34.874
Here it is. It's a letter
Denmark Tanny wrote to his daughter.

30:34.874 --> 30:38.419
We found it last night.
Family heirlooms and thingums.

30:38.419 --> 30:40.880
We think we found
a connection to the idol.

30:40.880 --> 30:44.717
Look, check this out.
See the king sun glyph here?

30:44.717 --> 30:45.635
Yeah.

30:45.635 --> 30:48.429
It matches the one
in the painting at Singh's house.

30:48.429 --> 30:51.266
- Couldn't that mean it's pretty common?
- Actually, no.

30:51.266 --> 30:53.643
These glyphs are Kalinago,
which has never been deciphered.

30:53.643 --> 30:55.186
- Never?
-  Never ever.

30:55.186 --> 30:56.104
Never ever.

30:56.104 --> 30:59.649
Some people believe that the captain
of the San Jose actually found somebody

30:59.649 --> 31:02.986
who knew how to translate these glyphs
because he found El Dorado.

31:04.237 --> 31:05.238
El Dorado.

31:06.739 --> 31:09.576
The priest that talked to Denmark Tanny,
that was on the Royal Merchant.

31:09.576 --> 31:10.702
Exactly.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.954
Every glyph that is in this letter

31:13.454 --> 31:15.039
is in the artifact.

31:15.039 --> 31:18.334
This isn't just
some random Rosetta stone for Kalinago.

31:18.334 --> 31:22.130
This... this is
a direct translation key for the idol!

31:22.130 --> 31:24.549
And we can use this to save Big John.

31:24.549 --> 31:27.677
Guys, we have to get this
to John B, like, yesterday.

31:28.344 --> 31:29.470
Hey!

31:30.763 --> 31:31.973
Where you going?

31:32.765 --> 31:33.975
Uh, to the break.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.144
We're gonna go check out the surf.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.438
Can we finish this later?

31:39.647 --> 31:41.691
Yeah. Have fun.

31:42.358 --> 31:43.234
Yeah.

31:50.575 --> 31:52.410
We're looking
at 15 minutes late.

31:52.410 --> 31:56.080
- She'll be here. I trust she'll be here.
- It's too bad she's unreliable.

31:56.956 --> 31:58.207
- Hey!
- See? See, Mom?

31:58.207 --> 32:00.293
I'm not an idiot.
There she is. How are you?

32:00.293 --> 32:01.878
- Good.
- Good to see you.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.924
So, um, I don't know if you heard,
but they got him.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.425
He's... he's in the station right now.

32:07.425 --> 32:09.886
- He's in there?
-  Yeah, John B's here.

32:09.886 --> 32:12.639
Shoupe tracked him down
somehow on Route 12.

32:12.639 --> 32:13.681
Thank God.

32:14.557 --> 32:15.391
Right?

32:17.852 --> 32:18.811
Can we talk?

32:19.812 --> 32:21.397
Yeah, yeah. What's... what's up?

32:25.777 --> 32:26.694
Walk with me.

32:29.864 --> 32:32.867
- Mom just give us a sec.
-  Topper, we're late.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.536
Oh, of course.

32:36.996 --> 32:39.666
-  All right. So, come on, Sarah.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.503
It's not like I can't guess
what you're gonna say right now.

32:43.503 --> 32:45.338
Are you on my side or his?

32:51.344 --> 32:53.388
I'm gonna say something really crazy,

32:54.097 --> 32:56.557
and I just need for you
to hear me out, please.

32:59.102 --> 33:00.812
John B's dad, Big John,

33:01.854 --> 33:03.648
is in South America right now.

33:04.607 --> 33:08.695
And he's in a lot of trouble,
and John B needs to go help him,

33:09.612 --> 33:11.698
but he can't do that if he's arrested.

33:12.365 --> 33:14.742
If he's arrested. Oh, so it is that.

33:14.742 --> 33:16.619
- No, Topper.
- You want me to not press charges.

33:16.619 --> 33:18.579
- No, that's not what I'm saying.
- Just tell me.

33:20.289 --> 33:22.583
I'm saying, just wait a day.

33:24.377 --> 33:27.296
And then after a day,
you can do whatever you want

33:27.296 --> 33:29.590
because John B is gonna be off the island.

33:30.216 --> 33:31.843
Do you see what I'm saying?

33:31.843 --> 33:33.136
Like, maybe forever.

33:38.099 --> 33:39.559
Forever.

33:43.730 --> 33:46.566
Okay, so if I just wait a day,

33:47.525 --> 33:49.277
John B will be gone.

33:50.778 --> 33:51.696
Yeah?

33:57.869 --> 33:58.703
Yes.

34:03.207 --> 34:04.917
And what? You'll go with him?

34:07.128 --> 34:08.087
I'll stay here.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.341
You promise me that?

34:16.345 --> 34:17.305
Promise.

34:22.560 --> 34:23.436
All right.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.397
All right, I trust you.

34:30.026 --> 34:31.444
I'll give you a day.

34:32.028 --> 34:33.029
Thank you.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.076
I'll hit you up tonight.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.369
Yeah.

34:40.369 --> 34:41.370
Okay.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.083
Hey, uh...

34:52.090 --> 34:53.007
I love you.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.737
- Topper, where is Sarah?
- Just get in the car, Mom.

35:14.737 --> 35:16.906
- They're waiting for us inside!
- Let's go.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.660
Oh, I should've seen this coming.

35:22.328 --> 35:24.372
You are just like your father.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.290
- So weak.

Hey, thanks for waiting. Um...

36:58.841 --> 37:00.635
Look who decided to come home.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.136
Hey.

37:02.970 --> 37:04.472
- Welcome back.
- Whoa!

37:04.472 --> 37:06.265

I have something
I want to share with you guys.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.281
- I can get us down to the Orinoco.

37:22.281 --> 37:23.908
- Are you serious?
-  Yeah.

37:24.533 --> 37:28.371
-  Okay. And how's that gonna happen?
- My dad's gonna let us use the plane.

37:28.371 --> 37:29.664
-  Ward?
-  Your dad?

37:29.664 --> 37:30.957
-  Yep.
-  Ah.

37:30.957 --> 37:33.960
We lay low tonight,
then wheels up first thing in the morning.

37:34.460 --> 37:38.005
Okay, that's a lot to process.
Your dad actually helping us.

37:38.005 --> 37:41.050
- I talked to him. He'll do it.
- So we trusting Ward now?

37:42.009 --> 37:42.969
Trust Sarah.

37:44.011 --> 37:44.887
All right.

37:44.887 --> 37:46.847
-  That's all I needed to hear.
-  Okay.

37:46.847 --> 37:49.934
But wait, I also just have
one more thing to say. Um...

37:51.727 --> 37:54.188
Since we've gotten back from the island,

37:55.481 --> 37:57.692
I've done some things that I regret.

37:58.734 --> 37:59.735
A lot.

38:05.866 --> 38:08.452
Yeah, uh...

38:08.452 --> 38:11.956
...I feel... I feel like we've all done
a thing or two that we regret.

38:15.501 --> 38:17.336
And I don't...

38:17.336 --> 38:18.421
Poguelandia,

38:18.963 --> 38:19.797
guys.

38:19.797 --> 38:21.841
It's all I've been able to think about.

38:21.841 --> 38:23.759
We were all together on that island,

38:23.759 --> 38:27.054
and it was a good thing,
and I don't want to ruin a good thing.

38:27.054 --> 38:28.472
And I...

38:28.472 --> 38:30.891
I just wanna know, are we still all in?

38:33.144 --> 38:34.687
Are we still all together?

38:37.690 --> 38:38.691
Because I am.

38:41.444 --> 38:42.528
Yeah.

38:46.073 --> 38:49.869
- We pon road!

38:49.869 --> 38:52.288
-  I love you.
- Still can't believe you got the plane.

38:52.288 --> 38:54.749
- I know!
- That's actually insane.

38:54.749 --> 38:58.627
Let's go get Big John, all right?
What do you say there, shit bird?

38:58.627 --> 39:00.212
I think this deserves a woogity.

39:00.212 --> 39:02.548
How long you gonna pretend
you're not coming over here?

39:02.548 --> 39:03.632
You in?

39:04.592 --> 39:07.553
-  Come over here, funny man.
-  We don't bite.

39:07.553 --> 39:10.639
-  Now we woogity!
- Oh, we're really doing this, aren't we?

39:10.639 --> 39:12.767
-  We're doing it, man!
-  Mm-hmm.

39:15.144 --> 39:17.897
<i>Hi, you've reached Sarah.
You know what to do.</i>

39:18.606 --> 39:20.983
All right. Let's try this one more time.

39:22.610 --> 39:24.653
<i>Hi, you've reached Sarah.
You know what to do.</i>

39:24.653 --> 39:26.697
All right, all right.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.326
Who are you calling 50 times?

39:30.910 --> 39:32.119
Huh? Who's not answering?

39:33.245 --> 39:34.747
I don't know, Rafe. Uh...

39:36.082 --> 39:38.751
Does your sister ever do
what she says she's gonna do?

39:38.751 --> 39:39.919
Not really, no.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.253
- Oh.
- Ah!

39:42.671 --> 39:46.300
- How'd she screw you this time?
- So I did your sister a favor, right?

39:46.300 --> 39:49.220
Got reamed by my mom.
I mean, it's a shit show, man.

39:49.220 --> 39:52.306
So I do this favor. She's like,
"Oh, I'll hit you tonight." It's tonight.

39:52.306 --> 39:54.600
Haven't heard a thing.
Been calling her. Nothing.

39:54.600 --> 39:58.020
She's just ignoring me.
So, I don't know, man.

39:58.020 --> 40:00.815
- I'm just a little confused. That's all.
- Listen. Listen.

40:01.899 --> 40:03.192
- Let's sit.
- Ah, shit.

40:05.820 --> 40:08.447
- Uh, she's playing you like a fiddle, bro.
- No.

40:08.447 --> 40:11.158
- She's been playing you since day one.
- It's a lot different now.

40:11.158 --> 40:13.869
You know
why she can't hit you up right now?

40:13.869 --> 40:16.580
- It's 'cause she's with John B.
-  Listen, Rafe.

40:16.580 --> 40:18.833
- She is not with John B.
-  Oh, okay.

40:19.542 --> 40:22.294
-  She wouldn't do that.
- Well, she thinks she's a Pogue now.

40:22.294 --> 40:25.673
Can't trust a Pogue, right?
Not that you could trust her anyways.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.341
And now she's with John B,

40:27.341 --> 40:29.885
and you're looking
at me like I'm the bad guy, right?

40:29.885 --> 40:33.931
Listen, she's gonna keep doing this
again and again...

40:33.931 --> 40:35.891
- All right.
- ...and again and again.

40:35.891 --> 40:38.102
- Just playing you like a fiddle.
- I'll catch you later.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.353
All right, Top.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.149
It's good to see you.

40:44.650 --> 40:46.360
So what kind of plane is it?

40:46.360 --> 40:49.113
Well, it's Ward's,
so I'm guessing something lit.

40:49.613 --> 40:52.992
That's what I'm talking about.
Flying private, baby.

40:54.618 --> 40:56.328
- Oh, thanks.
