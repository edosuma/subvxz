00:03.704 --> 00:05.973
[theme music]

00:07.508 --> 00:08.876
This coffee's great.

00:08.909 --> 00:11.545
It's like regular coffee, but
like with the volume turned up.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.481
Yeah.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.617
Well, it's this Jamaican stuff
that Edgar told me about.

00:16.650 --> 00:20.154
I think his dad used to
own about half of Jamaica.

00:20.188 --> 00:21.789
When did you start
grinding your own beans?

00:21.822 --> 00:24.825
Oh, you know, Edgar
told me to do that.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.295
He also said that you should
keep the beans in the freezer.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.663
Oh.
I didn't know that.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.266
Well, don't drink
it yet until I

00:32.300 --> 00:33.901
put the cinnamon in
there because, you know,

00:33.934 --> 00:36.637
that's what Edgar does.

00:36.670 --> 00:39.240
He's really funny when
he's making the coffee.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.575
You know, he kind of
hums all to himself.

00:41.609 --> 00:42.710
He stands there.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.945
You know what, he's like
scoop, hm, scoop, hm.

00:52.320 --> 00:56.257
Well, so you been seeing
a lot of Edgar lately.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.491
No I haven't!

00:57.525 --> 00:58.826
Yeah, you have.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.562
Yeah, you been over at his
place like every day since you

01:01.595 --> 01:02.563
met him.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.198
That's working on
the Wellman deal.

01:04.232 --> 01:05.233
God!

01:05.266 --> 01:06.167
It's not like Edgar--

01:06.200 --> 01:07.067
Oh, Edgar!

01:07.101 --> 01:07.968
Ha, ha, ha.

01:08.001 --> 01:08.936
Edgar.

01:08.969 --> 01:09.903
Edgar!

01:09.937 --> 01:10.904
Edgar!

01:10.938 --> 01:13.241
[silly laugh]

01:16.810 --> 01:17.678
What?

01:17.711 --> 01:18.712
Well, what?

01:18.746 --> 01:20.148
Look at-- you're--
you're-- you've said

01:20.181 --> 01:22.383
his name like a dozen
times already this morning.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.284
Uh uh!

01:23.317 --> 01:24.685
- Yes, you have!
- What?

01:24.718 --> 01:26.687
Do you have a problem with
hearing the name Edgar?

01:26.720 --> 01:28.055
No.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.990
I'm thinking, though, that you
might be getting to develop

01:30.023 --> 01:31.325
a little crush on the guy.

01:31.359 --> 01:32.160
Oh!

01:39.066 --> 01:41.034
Let's go drive by his house.

01:43.103 --> 01:47.541
[theme song] What doesn't
kill us is making us stronger.

01:47.575 --> 01:52.513
We're gonna last longer then
the greatest wall in China.

01:52.546 --> 01:55.516
Oh, that is rabid with a drone.

01:55.549 --> 02:00.954
If there's one thing that
I learned while waiting

02:00.988 --> 02:05.459
for my turn, it's that in
each life there's a rainfall,

02:05.493 --> 02:08.429
but you also get some sun.

02:08.462 --> 02:12.400
And we'll make out
better than OK.

02:12.433 --> 02:15.869
Hear what I say.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.305
Yeah any day.

02:24.845 --> 02:27.748
[laughter]

02:30.318 --> 02:32.786
He kind of reminds me of
like Gary Cooper or something,

02:32.820 --> 02:34.087
you know.

02:34.121 --> 02:35.856
One of those cowboy types
that would actually like tip

02:35.889 --> 02:37.591
his hat when he passes a lady.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.260
Listen to you!

02:39.293 --> 02:41.262
You're like that far
away from doodling

02:41.295 --> 02:42.363
his name in your yearbook.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.833
I'm just stating a fact.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.301
The man is good-looking.

02:47.335 --> 02:49.970
I mean, he's extremely
good-looking.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.573
You know, I'm just trying to
help you out here because you

02:52.606 --> 02:55.409
are really vulnerable right
now, with Dan being gone,

02:55.443 --> 02:57.177
and you're alone a lot.

02:57.211 --> 02:59.980
Jackie, I don't do vulnerable!

03:01.048 --> 03:02.350
Well, all right.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.584
Fine, whatever, you know.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.719
But you don't have to
admit that part of it.

03:05.753 --> 03:08.422
Just let me give you a
little piece of advice.

03:08.456 --> 03:09.490
Take it slow.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.125
Um-- listen.

03:12.159 --> 03:14.262
Once the whole Wellman
deal is complete,

03:14.295 --> 03:17.731
me and Edgar will probably
never even see each other again.

03:17.765 --> 03:20.701
Yeah, you're probably right.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.670
I mean, I might have
to call him once or twice

03:22.703 --> 03:25.205
to see how things are going!

03:25.239 --> 03:29.877
I mean, I did give
the guy $1 million!

03:29.910 --> 03:32.313
[music playing]

03:33.881 --> 03:36.183
You're a lucky man, Edgar.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.218
I have money.

03:38.252 --> 03:42.155
But I don't have
what you've got.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.764
Roseanne, there are
things that money can't buy.

04:00.641 --> 04:01.909
Not very many.

04:08.549 --> 04:09.350
Nice shot.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.423
So [clears throat] I'll
just read over the contract,

04:15.456 --> 04:17.257
and then sign it, and
we're all set, huh?

04:17.291 --> 04:19.660
Um, well, listen.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.695
Why don't you just not
worry your pretty little

04:21.729 --> 04:23.397
head about stuff like that
and just go right ahead

04:23.431 --> 04:24.598
and sign it?

04:24.632 --> 04:26.400
Ah, if there's one thing
my old man taught me,

04:26.434 --> 04:28.836
it's to read something
over before I sign it.

04:28.869 --> 04:32.172
See, through the fourth
quarter, compounded annually,

04:32.205 --> 04:34.041
parties obligated to--

04:34.074 --> 04:34.942
wait a minute.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.143
What's this?

04:36.176 --> 04:38.412
Look-- see, this doesn't
even concern you at all.

04:38.446 --> 04:39.547
Just go right ahead there.

04:39.580 --> 04:40.881
Sign it.

04:40.914 --> 04:44.318
I must be reading this wrong,
because according to this,

04:44.352 --> 04:45.719
after you give me
the million bucks

04:45.753 --> 04:48.689
and I pay off the bank loan,
I have to sleep with you.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.993
So!

04:53.026 --> 04:54.695
So, that's not
what we agreed to!

04:54.728 --> 04:55.829
Hey!

04:55.863 --> 04:57.365
Did you think I was just
giving you the money?

04:57.398 --> 04:58.866
How stupid do you think I am?

04:59.500 --> 05:00.300
Roseanne--

05:00.334 --> 05:01.635
Hey, hey, hey.

05:01.669 --> 05:02.836
Money will come and go.

05:02.870 --> 05:03.904
OK?

05:03.937 --> 05:05.373
But this night is
going to last forever.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.741
Now sign the damn thing
and get them pants off!

05:11.278 --> 05:14.114
[music playing]

05:16.183 --> 05:19.086
Hey!

05:19.119 --> 05:21.455
You were thinking about
him just now, weren't you?

05:21.489 --> 05:22.590
I was not!

05:22.623 --> 05:25.493
I was thinking about--
uh-- doing the laundry!

05:27.094 --> 05:29.497
Whose laundry?

05:29.530 --> 05:31.031
Uh--

05:31.064 --> 05:31.865
Bah!

05:37.270 --> 05:38.138
Hey, Deej.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.740
How you hitting 'em?

05:39.773 --> 05:42.209
How am I hitting what?

05:42.242 --> 05:43.511
No, no.

05:43.544 --> 05:44.945
It's another way of saying
how are you doing, you know.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.580
They call it an allegory.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.452
Can you uh-- can you
hand me that Phillips head?

05:54.988 --> 05:57.391
Cheers.

05:57.425 --> 05:58.992
Not so good.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.060
What?

06:00.093 --> 06:02.563
I'm not hitting 'em so good.

06:03.831 --> 06:04.998
Yeah, I know.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.600
When I was your age, man,
I had a lot on my mind.

06:06.634 --> 06:07.968
Then I got a little
older, and it went away.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.772
So what's up there, big guy?

06:16.944 --> 06:17.945
It's Heather.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.613
We've been hanging
out for a while now.

06:19.647 --> 06:20.948
Everything's going great.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.450
We really like each other.
- OK.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.383
Stop right there, kid.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.885
You came to the right guy.

06:24.918 --> 06:25.819
I know women.

06:25.853 --> 06:26.654
I married one.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.457
Been up and down that road.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.259
Busted a couple of tires,
even broken an axle or two.

06:32.292 --> 06:36.096
Can we skip the analogies
and get to the point?

06:36.129 --> 06:37.465
Hey, hey.

06:37.498 --> 06:38.999
Look, I'm just trying to help
you out here, kid, you know?

06:39.032 --> 06:39.967
Women are tricky.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.569
And you're still
wet behind the neck.

06:43.471 --> 06:44.371
Sorry.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.272
Look, it's all right.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.373
All right?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.675
I want to help you, OK.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.843
But I don't want to waste
my valuable time unless you

06:49.877 --> 06:51.144
really, really like this girl.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.045
Yeah, I do.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.046
I really, really do.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.414
OK.
So what's the problem?

06:54.448 --> 06:55.382
All right.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.317
She went to Chicago
with her mother,

06:57.350 --> 06:58.786
and didn't even tell
me till the day before.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.621
What?
She's 15 years old.

07:00.654 --> 07:01.722
Give her a break, you know.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.390
She's still gotta do
what her mother says.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.725
Yeah, I know.
But there's other stuff.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.894
Like when we go out, she always
wants to pick where we go.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.195
Well, who cares?

07:08.228 --> 07:09.563
As long as you're out with
her, and she's looking good?

07:12.199 --> 07:13.300
OK.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.368
I guess what gets me,
she's all opinionated.

07:15.402 --> 07:17.705
Doesn't even care if I
agree with her or not.

07:17.738 --> 07:18.606
Dump her.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.976
[music playing]

07:24.545 --> 07:27.214
There's more to this Edgar
thing than you're letting on.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.857
OK.

07:36.890 --> 07:37.758
OK.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.860
Just-- just have a seat, OK?

07:39.893 --> 07:41.862
And I'm going to
tell you something.

07:41.895 --> 07:44.665
And I do not want you to
freak out or smirk at me

07:44.698 --> 07:46.600
or pop out your eyes or
any of that weird stuff.

07:46.634 --> 07:47.134
OK.
OK.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.301
Just sitting.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.971
Maybe I do have
a crush on him.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.775
Shut up!

07:54.808 --> 07:55.676
Sorry.

07:55.709 --> 07:56.610
I know.

07:56.644 --> 07:57.511
No reaction.

07:57.545 --> 07:58.979
No reaction.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.248
Maybe I do have feelings
for him, you know.

08:01.281 --> 08:04.818
And it's freaking me out
because I still love Dan

08:04.852 --> 08:07.788
and I still think I hear
him in the house here.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.823
OK, let me tell you-- uh,
let me ask one question.

08:11.925 --> 08:15.062
You better be careful.

08:15.095 --> 08:18.566
Does Edgar know that
you feel this way?

08:18.599 --> 08:19.833
No!

08:19.867 --> 08:21.434
Of course he doesn't,
because whenever I'm with him

08:21.468 --> 08:23.804
I just babble like an idiot
and stare at his teeth.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.074
I mean, the guy's
been everywhere.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.075
He's done everything.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.076
He's been around the world.

08:29.109 --> 08:29.943
I know.

08:29.977 --> 08:30.844
See?

08:30.878 --> 08:32.312
That's my point, you see.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.915
What I'm thinking now,
he's sown his wild oats.

08:34.948 --> 08:40.420
See now he might be looking for
something a little more earthy.

08:40.453 --> 08:41.454
What's that?

08:41.488 --> 08:42.956
A nice way of saying "fat"?

08:44.491 --> 08:45.826
OK.

08:45.859 --> 08:46.727
All right.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.029
Now, you love Dan.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.631
And yet, you're
attracted to Edgar.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.766
So this becomes the question.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.202
Do you encourage that
with Edgar and open up

08:55.235 --> 08:56.570
that whole can of worms?

08:56.604 --> 08:58.972
Or do you shut out all your
feelings about Edgar, you see,

08:59.006 --> 09:01.341
and hold everything down
deep inside of you buried

09:01.374 --> 09:02.242
for the rest of your days?

09:02.275 --> 09:03.410
And then do you live with that--

09:03.443 --> 09:05.078
Put a lid on it, OK?

09:05.112 --> 09:06.980
Because you're
making me even more

09:07.014 --> 09:09.316
scared than I was when
I first talked to you.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.852
I mean, you know, the last
time I went out with somebody,

09:11.885 --> 09:13.854
it lasted for 25 years.

09:13.887 --> 09:17.090
Well, see, that went
pretty well, didn't it?

09:19.927 --> 09:20.828
Did he ask you on a date?

09:20.861 --> 09:21.729
No!

09:21.762 --> 09:23.997
No.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.466
I could never go
on a date anyway.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.268
I mean, that would be like
going back in the workforce

09:28.301 --> 09:31.204
after your kids have gone
off to college, or prison,

09:31.238 --> 09:32.706
or wherever.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.108
No, It's not that bad.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.209
Yeah it is.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.846
It's like a whole
new technology.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.347
It's like if you got
trained on a typewriter,

09:40.380 --> 09:42.783
and now everybody's
using computers.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.351
I wouldn't even know
where to put my fingers.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.588
No, that would all
come back to you.

09:48.622 --> 09:52.292
But see now what I'm
thinking is, you know,

09:52.325 --> 09:54.561
you and Edgar actually
have a lot more in common

09:54.594 --> 09:55.763
than you realize.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.765
The two of you saved
Wellman's Plastics together,

09:57.798 --> 09:59.532
let alone the whole town.

09:59.566 --> 10:00.367
Oh.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.304
Yeah.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.207
Well, I guess I never
thought about it like that.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.077
[music playing]

10:10.110 --> 10:13.546
May I present to you
the First Lady of the land

10:13.580 --> 10:15.115
for you, Rosita
Duarte de Wellman.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.884
[crowd cheering]

10:21.822 --> 10:26.626
Workers of Wellman,
I know your suffering.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.396
I am one of you.

10:29.429 --> 10:32.232
Or I was one of you
until I got really rich

10:32.265 --> 10:34.034
and could afford to buy
all these cool gowns.

10:35.635 --> 10:39.807
The fact is, the General and
I are turning over the factory

10:39.840 --> 10:42.575
to you, the workers!

10:42.609 --> 10:45.445
[crowd cheering]

10:46.546 --> 10:50.450
Don't cry for me,
Wellman Plastics.

10:50.483 --> 10:54.387
The fact is, I
finally bought you.

10:54.421 --> 10:58.325
We're simple people
with blue collars

10:58.358 --> 11:02.562
who just happen to
have $108 million.

11:07.167 --> 11:13.040
[singing] Who just happen
to have 108 million dollars.

11:18.145 --> 11:22.015
[music playing]

11:26.686 --> 11:27.554
Yeah.

11:27.587 --> 11:31.792
So, she uh-- she's independent.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.827
And you don't want to dump her.

11:33.861 --> 11:37.664
Your only choice-- tame her.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.399
Can you tell me
how to do that?

11:39.432 --> 11:40.667
Sure, I tamed your
sister, didn't I?

11:40.700 --> 11:42.335
And she's a Conner woman.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.137
Let me tell you, they ain't
no freaking night in France.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.441
So what do I do?

11:48.475 --> 11:49.342
All right.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.845
Rule number uno.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.781
Don't let them dress you.
OK?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.816
Like this one time, Becky
wanted me to wear this tie

11:55.849 --> 11:57.150
to this fancy restaurant.
Right?

11:57.184 --> 11:58.385
I didn't.

11:58.418 --> 12:01.855
So we get there, the maitre
d' doesn't let us in.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.957
We get home, she runs
to the bedroom crying.

12:03.991 --> 12:07.627
I eat a TV dinner like I
wanted to in the first place.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.729
Weren't you
worried she'd be mad?

12:09.763 --> 12:10.931
Oh, no, no.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.465
See, I smoothed things
out later that night, huh?

12:12.499 --> 12:13.366
Ah.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.235
[chuckling]

12:15.268 --> 12:18.438
Which brings us
to rule numero two--

12:18.471 --> 12:21.341
the man controls the romance.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.675
Like how?

12:22.709 --> 12:25.979
God, like say Becky's kissing
me on the neck, all right.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.782
Even though I like it,
I tell her, I'm busy.

12:28.816 --> 12:29.817
I shrug it off.

12:29.850 --> 12:30.683
OK.

12:30.717 --> 12:31.751
Now I don't get this.

12:31.785 --> 12:32.652
You like it.

12:32.685 --> 12:34.888
So why do you pretend you don't?

12:34.922 --> 12:36.556
Well, it's all about control.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.025
You've got to let her
know that you're making

12:38.058 --> 12:39.726
the decisions here, right?

12:39.759 --> 12:42.162
Later on she's that
much more eager.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.096
Wow!

12:43.130 --> 12:44.031
Yeah.

12:44.064 --> 12:47.835
[chuckling]

12:47.868 --> 12:49.136
Rule C.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.406
She says to you,
I love you, right.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.042
Whatever you do, you
don't say it back to her,

12:55.075 --> 12:56.910
because then she's got you.

12:56.944 --> 13:00.147
Just say me too or ditto.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.348
What does that get you?

13:01.381 --> 13:02.649
Respect.

13:02.682 --> 13:03.984
All right.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.419
And it'll make them try that
much more harder next time.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.121
You know, sure, they might
get fed up with you once

13:08.155 --> 13:09.256
in a while, cut you off.

13:09.289 --> 13:15.662
Sometimes a week, maybe
two, once even 46 days.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.634
But the beauty part of
it is, they're cutting

13:21.668 --> 13:23.703
themselves off too, right?

13:23.736 --> 13:24.604
So who's the loser there?

13:28.475 --> 13:29.609
I'm not sure any
of this stuff is

13:29.642 --> 13:31.278
gonna work on Heather, though.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.379
Of course it will, man.

13:32.412 --> 13:35.048
All women are the same.

13:35.082 --> 13:39.019
Of course, some have
bigger boobs, hey, Mark?

13:39.052 --> 13:42.489
Now you catching on, baby.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.824
[music playing]

13:46.826 --> 13:48.661
Well, I think
that about does it.

13:48.695 --> 13:52.132
The employee buyout of
Wellman's Plastics is complete.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.901
Workers of the world unite.

13:53.934 --> 13:54.902
It's Miller time!

13:57.537 --> 14:01.541
Uh, would you
settle for champagne?

14:01.574 --> 14:02.442
Whoa.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.077
I'm so impressed.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.046
You've got your
own bucket thingy.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.981
Ah.

14:08.015 --> 14:11.018
Oh, you've done something
great here, Roseanne.

14:11.051 --> 14:14.154
Well, I figure I owed it
to the factory after all.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.257
It did suck the life
out of me for 12 years.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.591
Well, that's all
going to change

14:18.625 --> 14:22.095
now, now that the employees
are working for themselves.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.563
I think we should have a toast.

14:23.596 --> 14:24.464
Um--

14:24.497 --> 14:25.365
Oh, I know.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.766
To the people of Argentina.

14:26.799 --> 14:27.600
What?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.972
Oh, that's just some
old saying in my family.

14:36.343 --> 14:39.879
So now that the whole
buyout deal is complete,

14:39.913 --> 14:42.282
I'll let you get back
to whatever in the hell

14:42.315 --> 14:44.617
it was you were doing before
you started going around saving

14:44.651 --> 14:45.518
all these factories.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.987
Oh, hey, this has been great.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.156
You know, I got to tell you.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.657
I really enjoyed
spending time with you.

14:50.690 --> 14:51.558
Yeah?

14:51.591 --> 14:52.759
Yeah.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.127
[awkward laughter]

14:58.498 --> 15:04.604
Well, then, you know,
maybe we could still

15:04.637 --> 15:07.640
spend time together,
you know, if that's what

15:07.674 --> 15:09.676
we both you know, kind of--

15:15.915 --> 15:19.786
God, how many logs did
you stick on that fire?

15:19.819 --> 15:23.290
Yeah, I guess it is getting
a little warm in here.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.457
What were we talking about?

15:24.491 --> 15:25.725
That we don't have
to quit spending

15:25.758 --> 15:30.430
time together because we
just finished our business.

15:30.463 --> 15:35.535
Yeah, cause you are
really easy to be with.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.770
So are you.
Thanks.

15:37.804 --> 15:38.738
No, really.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.874
I've felt this
connection with you.

15:41.908 --> 15:44.211
You know much about
Eastern philosophy?

15:44.244 --> 15:45.112
No.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.613
Oh, you mean much?

15:46.646 --> 15:47.447
No.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.818
Well, you know that I lived
in the ashram for a year.

15:51.851 --> 15:54.654
And ever since we met, I
just had this feeling that--

15:54.687 --> 15:58.558
this strange feeling that
we've met somewhere before.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.093
But-- well, like--

16:00.127 --> 16:01.194
ah, this is silly.

16:01.228 --> 16:02.095
I--

16:02.129 --> 16:03.096
No.
No.

16:03.130 --> 16:03.997
That's OK.

16:04.031 --> 16:04.964
You can keep going.

16:04.998 --> 16:07.334
I'll just have more to drink.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.236
Well, I think
we must have known

16:09.269 --> 16:11.571
each other in another lifetime.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.173
I look in your eyes,
and I see deeper

16:13.206 --> 16:16.443
than the you that's sitting
right here in front of me.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.145
Does that make sense?

16:18.178 --> 16:19.046
Well, yeah.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.247
I mean, you know--

16:20.280 --> 16:22.815
it sounds OK when you say it.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.351
I mean if somebody
else said it, I'd

16:24.384 --> 16:25.318
think they were full of crap.

16:29.722 --> 16:32.059
How come you
never got married?

16:32.092 --> 16:33.060
I don't know.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.395
I guess I never found
the right woman.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.397
I mean, you certainly had a
lot of opportunities, right?

16:37.430 --> 16:38.731
I mean, look at you.

16:38.765 --> 16:39.832
Sure, I've had opportunities.

16:39.866 --> 16:42.435
But they were all on
a superficial level.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.636
I want something deeper.

16:46.906 --> 16:49.042
I beet you feel
that way sometimes.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.177
Oh, yeah.

16:50.210 --> 16:54.581
I mean, only every
single minute of my life.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.583
I mean, you know, I'm
really tough on the outside

16:56.616 --> 16:57.484
and everything.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.853
But um-- I don't know.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.755
I've always wondered
what it would be like,

17:02.789 --> 17:07.794
you know, just for one day
to be that girl that all

17:07.827 --> 17:09.862
the guys are staring at.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.564
You know?

17:11.598 --> 17:15.368
The one that they can't
take their eyes off of.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.704
I've never told
anybody that before.

17:17.737 --> 17:21.074
Well, thanks for taking
me into your confidence.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.041
I'm honored, Roseanne.

17:28.281 --> 17:31.184
God, it's been so great
working with you, Edgar.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.653
It's just been great.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.156
[music playing]

17:36.189 --> 17:39.126
Roseanne, I can't
take my eyes off of you.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.876
[fireworks sounds]

17:58.478 --> 18:01.314
[cheering]

18:10.823 --> 18:14.127
Where have you been?

18:14.161 --> 18:15.128
It's 4:00 in the morning.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.296
For all I know,
you could have been

18:16.329 --> 18:17.430
rolled in a ditch somewhere.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.266
I was just about to
start to call hospitals.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.133
Hey.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.368
Be quiet, OK.

18:21.401 --> 18:22.835
You're going to wake
everybody in the whole house.

18:22.869 --> 18:23.936
Hospitals?
This is Lanford.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.772
There's only one hospital.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.875
You had me worried sick.

18:28.908 --> 18:31.311
Well, ground me and take
the car away for a month.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.212
All right.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.112
What happened?

18:33.146 --> 18:34.747
What ha-- come-- come here!

18:37.517 --> 18:38.651
What'd he do?

18:38.685 --> 18:40.853
Pump you full of booze
and turn on the charm?

18:40.887 --> 18:42.655
Do we have anything
to eat around here?

18:42.689 --> 18:44.857
Because I'm starving.

18:44.891 --> 18:48.295
Oh no!

18:48.328 --> 18:49.262
All right.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.197
Stop toying with me.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.164
I want to know what happened.

18:51.198 --> 18:53.032
I want to know right now.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.667
Oh, Jackie.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.404
Edgar is such a great
person, you know.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.505
He's nice.

18:58.538 --> 18:59.706
He's funny.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.174
He's really smart.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.542
God, he's so good-looking.

19:02.575 --> 19:03.876
Yeah, I know that.

19:03.910 --> 19:07.480
I-- Sit down!

19:07.514 --> 19:08.981
You tell me the part
that I don't know.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.654
All right.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.089
Well, you know, a part of
me just want to go ahead

19:17.123 --> 19:19.459
and just do it, you know?

19:19.492 --> 19:21.160
I mean, I even imagined
the two of us together.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.162
It was incredible.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.731
I saw rockets lifting.

19:24.764 --> 19:25.732
I saw fireworks!

19:25.765 --> 19:27.867
I saw waves crashing
against the shore!

19:27.900 --> 19:29.636
I saw great big trays of donuts!

19:31.938 --> 19:32.872
It was awesome!

19:36.209 --> 19:38.878
But it was all in my head.

19:38.911 --> 19:43.416
You know, the part of me
that was sitting there,

19:43.450 --> 19:46.653
I just shook his hand,
and I stayed there

19:46.686 --> 19:48.054
talking for a couple hours.

19:48.087 --> 19:49.789
And you just walked away?

19:49.822 --> 19:50.590
Wow.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.895
Well, maybe if
I would have met

19:55.928 --> 19:57.430
Edgar another time,
another place,

19:57.464 --> 19:58.631
you know, one of those stories.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.132
But I didn't.
And it didn't.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.033
And it doesn't.

20:01.067 --> 20:01.934
And here I am.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.803
Boom.

20:03.836 --> 20:04.971
No regrets?

20:05.004 --> 20:07.039
Yeah, I got a lot of regrets.

20:07.073 --> 20:10.610
I'm gonna cherish
every one of them.

20:10.643 --> 20:11.811
Well, I'm going to go.

20:11.844 --> 20:14.647
Oh, would you just
stay with me, Jackie?

20:14.681 --> 20:19.218
Cause I know I'm not
going to be able to sleep,

20:19.252 --> 20:21.621
you know, for days probably.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.990
All right.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.358
These are stale.

20:31.264 --> 20:35.134
Jackie, Argentina, OK?

20:35.167 --> 20:37.169
Is that the one with
all the rain forests

20:37.203 --> 20:38.237
or the one with all the Nazis?

20:45.445 --> 20:48.681
Hey Mark, I took your
advice about Heather.

20:48.715 --> 20:49.582
Well, great.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.951
Don't have to thank me.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.220
She called me a pig and
kicked me out of her house!

20:55.488 --> 20:56.856
That's perfect!

20:56.889 --> 20:58.658
You got her right
where you want her.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.828
She's going to call you tomorrow
and tell you that she's sorry.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.263
She left a headless
Ken doll in my locker!

21:08.034 --> 21:09.902
Man, that's even better.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.439
Deej, this girl really digs you.

21:12.472 --> 21:13.406
No, I don't think so.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.441
I think she's really mad!

21:14.474 --> 21:16.242
Of course she is.
She's miserable.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.977
She can't stop
thinking about you.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.479
Look, I'm the one
who's miserable.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.247
I'm gonna call
her and apologize.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.783
Hey, kid.

21:23.816 --> 21:24.617
What are you, gay?

21:26.586 --> 21:28.588
Look, we've got
to think of ways

21:28.621 --> 21:32.058
to keep this thing going here.

21:32.091 --> 21:33.292
Got it!

21:33.326 --> 21:36.596
You walk by her house
holding another girl's hand.

21:36.629 --> 21:37.930
How do you come
up with this stuff?

21:40.367 --> 21:41.167
The gift!

21:44.871 --> 21:46.573

21:47.574 --> 21:51.444
