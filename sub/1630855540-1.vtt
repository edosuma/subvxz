02:41.908 --> 02:45.972
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
flight 492 to New York is delayed.</i>

02:46.067 --> 02:48.596
<i>Please report to gate 11.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:49.268 --> 02:50.804
<i>Early bird gets</i>
<i>the worm.</i>

02:51.252 --> 02:53.716
<i>Well, if the
worm is delayed by two hours,</i>

02:53.811 --> 02:55.827
then the early bird
gets to sneak in a nap.

02:55.923 --> 02:58.260
Anything else?

02:58.868 --> 03:00.212
Uh...

03:02.932 --> 03:04.852
Hmm. Look at this.

03:05.204 --> 03:06.708
Anything unicorn.

07:12.404 --> 07:14.388
<i>911. What's your</i>
<i>emergency?</i>

07:15.572 --> 07:18.420
<i>Hello? 911. Is anyone there?</i>

07:19.092 --> 07:20.084
<i>Hello?</i>

07:27.796 --> 07:32.756
"They are rusted so
badly that I cannot move them at all.

07:32.852 --> 07:38.068
If I am well oiled,
I shall soon be right again.

07:38.644 --> 07:44.340
You will find an oil-can on a
shelf in my cottage." Next.

07:44.436 --> 07:49.204
"Dorothy at once ran back
to the cottage and found the oil-can,

07:49.300 --> 07:53.652
and then she returned and asked
anxiously, 'Where are your joints?'

07:54.036 --> 07:56.916
'Oil my neck, first, '
replied the Tin Woodman."

07:57.012 --> 07:58.292
Next.

07:59.156 --> 08:02.324
She never, ever talks.

08:02.708 --> 08:04.372
Class, that's enough.

08:05.780 --> 08:07.092
Next.

08:07.188 --> 08:08.820
"Dorothy at once ran
back to the cottage"--

08:08.916 --> 08:10.548
Hey.

08:10.644 --> 08:12.404
- Mr. Stanton?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:12.500 --> 08:14.036
- We're in the middle of class.
- I know.

08:14.132 --> 08:15.860
- Pack your stuff up. We gotta
go. - Mr. Stanton.

08:15.956 --> 08:17.428
One second. I'm so sorry.

08:17.524 --> 08:18.676
Come on. You gotta go.

08:18.772 --> 08:20.628
You can't just take
her out of the class.

08:20.724 --> 08:21.620
Next time, I'll call.

08:21.940 --> 08:23.444
- Mr. Stanton, please.
- Oh, sorry. Sorry about that.

08:23.540 --> 08:25.396
- It's okay, class. Mr. Stanton.
- All right. All right.

08:25.844 --> 08:26.932
Hey.

08:27.028 --> 08:30.004
I was thinking, we
never take trips.

08:30.100 --> 08:31.924
Why don't we leave the city, you
know?

08:32.020 --> 08:34.035
Get out there,
get some fresh air in our lungs.

08:34.131 --> 08:36.500
Little father-daughter trip.
Hop in. Come on. Come on.

08:45.492 --> 08:48.276
Milky, I need you to call me
back, bro. What the fuck?

08:48.372 --> 08:50.868
All right? Call, text, whatever.
I'm on the road for a little while.

09:12.244 --> 09:15.572
Ugh. What? Do people
in this town hate music?

09:17.717 --> 09:19.060
Ah. Here we go.

09:19.508 --> 09:21.748
Here's some of your dad's music
from when he was a kid.

09:23.412 --> 09:26.932

made for you and me</i> ♪

09:27.028 --> 09:30.100

11:12.917 --> 11:14.420
Looks like you.

11:18.964 --> 11:20.340
Meet your grandfather.

11:22.676 --> 11:24.244
I'm starving.

11:25.492 --> 11:28.404
What's he got in here?

11:30.868 --> 11:32.053
It's delicious.

11:32.148 --> 11:34.772
Isn't that delicious? That good?
Yeah.

11:35.124 --> 11:37.492
Ooh. You can't find food
like this in the city.

11:37.588 --> 11:39.860
Probably got this from a
chicken down the road, yeah?

11:39.956 --> 11:41.876
He probably knows the
chicken's name.

11:41.972 --> 11:43.732
You're a limo driver?

11:46.868 --> 11:48.788
Am I driving a limo? Yes.

11:49.460 --> 11:51.060
Am I a limo driver?

11:51.157 --> 11:52.788
No. No.

11:53.173 --> 11:55.284
No, I was actually starting a
business

11:55.732 --> 11:56.852
driving limos,

11:57.364 --> 11:58.965
and I bought four at auction,

11:59.476 --> 12:00.980
and when I went to pick 'em up,

12:01.076 --> 12:03.124
they were these '90s
pieces of shit you saw, right?

12:03.701 --> 12:07.700
You know, worn-out leather, no TV.
It's like, "How am I gonna rent these?

12:07.796 --> 12:09.397
I can't rent 'em out."
And I couldn't, right?

12:09.493 --> 12:10.868
So, I call the guy,
and I'm like,

12:11.124 --> 12:13.748
"Listen, this is not what I
ordered from-- from the catalog."

12:13.844 --> 12:15.764
And he just takes the bill
of sale and he's like,

12:15.860 --> 12:17.620
"You can just go kiss
your own ass."

12:18.676 --> 12:21.877
Anyway, long story
long.

12:22.644 --> 12:25.044
This world is full of
lowlifes, man.

12:25.492 --> 12:29.460
Everybody is just out there trying
to stab that knife in your back.

12:30.645 --> 12:32.084
So, what do I say?

12:32.437 --> 12:35.317
If you want something in life,
you gotta go take it.

12:35.413 --> 12:36.788
Right, baby girl?

12:38.004 --> 12:40.181
So... I did.

12:40.820 --> 12:43.348
I got this business opportunity
came my way,

12:43.444 --> 12:46.997
and soon, someone's gonna be
driving us around, huh?

12:47.348 --> 12:50.292
Hmm.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.525
Speaking of...

12:55.252 --> 12:56.533
Milky, hey.

12:56.628 --> 12:58.068
Hold on for a second.

12:58.996 --> 13:00.116
Uh-huh.

13:00.660 --> 13:02.612
Mil-- Milky, that's-- that's--

13:02.708 --> 13:04.788
Yes. No, tell him he can
have the whole thing.

13:04.884 --> 13:05.941
I don't give a shit.

13:06.037 --> 13:08.788
I wanna unload it all.
No, I don't wanna keep it.

13:09.140 --> 13:10.516
Okay, so--

13:10.612 --> 13:12.885
All right. I-- No, I'll come
back to the city right now.

13:12.980 --> 13:14.709
Drop me a pin and I'll
come back.

13:14.805 --> 13:17.300
All right. Okay. I'll call
you back. Bye.

13:18.836 --> 13:20.180
Fuck yes!

13:23.988 --> 13:27.189
So, I gotta go back to the city
to do some work,

13:27.285 --> 13:30.676
and I figured that, you know, I
would just zip on back there myself,

13:30.772 --> 13:32.596
and you guys can hang
out for a while

13:32.692 --> 13:34.805
and get to know each other
a little better, right?

13:34.901 --> 13:35.829
How's that sound?

13:35.925 --> 13:37.492
Hey, kid. Hey, hey, hey.

13:37.845 --> 13:39.284
Let's calm down, all right?

13:39.380 --> 13:42.260
This is very, very important business.

13:42.356 --> 13:43.764
Goddamn it. Shit!

13:43.860 --> 13:44.916
Okay, enough.

13:45.012 --> 13:46.612
I make the rules.
I'm your father,

13:46.708 --> 13:49.684
and if I say you're gonna stay
here, you're gonna stay here with him.

13:50.804 --> 13:51.764
She's fine.

14:00.789 --> 14:01.972
<i>Kids, huh?</i>

14:02.900 --> 14:04.084
Oh, wait.

14:05.844 --> 14:07.700
You wouldn't know.

14:11.124 --> 14:13.876
♪ <i>Wouldn't it be nice if we were</i>
<i>older?</i> ♪

14:13.972 --> 14:17.812

14:27.637 --> 14:29.461
Found a letter in Mom's
old stuff.

14:29.557 --> 14:31.317
I've actually known
where you were for years.

14:31.413 --> 14:32.788
She can't stay.

14:33.876 --> 14:34.740
Why?

14:34.836 --> 14:37.045
I-It's just gonna be,
like, for a day.

14:37.141 --> 14:38.516
You'll barely notice her.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.245
Jesus. What's the problem?

14:40.340 --> 14:41.652
Find somebody else.

14:42.228 --> 14:45.524
You think that if there was
any-- literally anybody else,

14:45.620 --> 14:48.148
that I wouldn't have
gone to them before you?

14:51.956 --> 14:54.132
Okay. Listen.

14:56.916 --> 14:59.189
I just need this one
thing from you.

15:00.245 --> 15:01.524
Just this one thing,

15:01.620 --> 15:04.340
a-a-and then you're never gonna
hear from us again.

15:04.917 --> 15:05.973
Okay?

15:11.605 --> 15:13.108
Okay.

15:28.436 --> 15:30.005
It's gonna be different.

15:32.596 --> 15:35.637
I know I said that before,
but this time, it's real.

15:36.789 --> 15:38.549
You don't believe me, do you?

15:39.701 --> 15:41.397
You can believe me this time.

15:41.876 --> 15:44.213
This time, I promise,

15:44.309 --> 15:45.748
it's gonna be different.

15:46.868 --> 15:47.956
Okay?

16:04.276 --> 16:07.221
I'll be back before you guys
can form a lasting bond.

16:13.812 --> 16:15.125
Hey.

16:15.796 --> 16:16.821
What's her name?

16:18.709 --> 16:19.861
Delfi.

17:01.524 --> 17:03.508
You don't say very much, do you?

17:06.037 --> 17:09.236
Well, you're going to make some
man very happy one day.

17:30.069 --> 17:32.212
Damn it!

17:35.541 --> 17:37.365
You stay out of my
way, all right?

17:37.461 --> 17:39.924
Stop eating all the
goddamn profits.

17:50.293 --> 17:51.380
What's the matter with you?

17:51.476 --> 17:53.749
You wanna be blind
as well as mute?

17:59.316 --> 18:00.308
Here.

18:01.012 --> 18:02.389
Put these on.

18:04.309 --> 18:05.621
Can you see?

18:05.717 --> 18:06.996
Good.

18:07.796 --> 18:09.205
Get over there.

18:45.172 --> 18:46.805
Come on, Saint Francis.

18:48.276 --> 18:49.333
Gimme.

19:01.813 --> 19:03.957
You one of those bleeding
hearts, huh?

19:05.205 --> 19:06.452
Well...

19:07.637 --> 19:10.132
let me be the first
to break it to you, kid.

19:12.948 --> 19:14.453
You can't save 'em all.

19:17.141 --> 19:18.293
Damn.

19:45.333 --> 19:46.676
Deliveries.

19:47.189 --> 19:48.500
Let's go.

20:10.293 --> 20:11.604
What now?

20:23.092 --> 20:26.197
Listen, brat, I'm a
grown man, okay?

20:26.677 --> 20:28.341
No. No. No. No.

20:32.949 --> 20:36.149
Fine. Fine. Jesus Christ.

21:22.453 --> 21:23.829
Quit staring at me.

21:25.109 --> 21:26.101
It's late.

21:27.093 --> 21:28.404
Go to sleep.

22:36.213 --> 22:37.492
Morning, Pete.

22:42.037 --> 22:43.605
Can I call you "Pete"?

22:56.373 --> 22:57.493
Do you know why I'm here?

23:00.213 --> 23:01.717
And yet, here I am.

23:02.901 --> 23:05.300
An old stranger sitting in your
kitchen.

23:09.813 --> 23:11.637
Do you know who The Merchant is?

23:14.549 --> 23:15.605
Good.

23:19.893 --> 23:23.157
There was these guys.
Fucking Nazi tattoos.

23:23.573 --> 23:25.428
Everybody killed each other.

23:28.565 --> 23:30.901
I didn't-- I didn't know
who it belonged to.

23:33.877 --> 23:35.541
Okay. The bag.

23:40.916 --> 23:42.101
You can have it.

23:42.197 --> 23:44.053
It's yours, okay?
I don't-- I don't want it.

23:50.581 --> 23:51.957
Well, thanks, Pete.

23:53.781 --> 23:56.309
I had a feeling you'd be
a reasonable bloke.

23:58.101 --> 24:00.213
It's just an honest
mistake, right?

24:00.597 --> 24:01.941
No harm, no foul.

24:31.925 --> 24:34.005
Fuck! Stop, stop, stop! No!

24:36.213 --> 24:38.549
Why the fuck would you
have to have a kid?

24:45.173 --> 24:46.837
Why couldn't you have a cat?

24:47.221 --> 24:49.237
I just have to go get it.

24:49.333 --> 24:51.221
And then I'm gonna bring it
right to you.

24:51.317 --> 24:52.949
All you gotta do is go get it
and bring it back.

24:53.045 --> 24:54.613
-Yes! -Okay, shall we meet
back here then?

24:54.709 --> 24:55.957
What time is good for you?

25:09.589 --> 25:11.541
Okay, enough. Enough.
Enough. Enough.

25:12.213 --> 25:13.461
Moment of truth, Pete.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.781
You wanna see your little girl?

25:17.876 --> 25:19.957
Or do you want me to see
your little girl?

25:23.957 --> 25:25.013
Okay.

25:25.366 --> 25:26.613
Okay.

25:27.797 --> 25:28.821
I have it.

25:29.333 --> 25:30.709
Gonna pay for this?

25:33.493 --> 25:34.741
Huh?

25:40.469 --> 25:43.093
It's... over here.

25:46.869 --> 25:48.149
Is this how he raised you?

25:53.781 --> 25:54.933
Clean that up.

25:57.173 --> 25:58.038
Hello?

25:58.133 --> 26:00.021
<i>Delfi</i> ...

26:01.013 --> 26:03.605
She likes to put grapes in her
cereal.

26:04.501 --> 26:06.325
The red ones.

26:06.421 --> 26:07.669
<i>Not the green ones.</i>

26:08.021 --> 26:10.037
- Peter...
- <i>She's--</i>

26:10.741 --> 26:12.725
She's allergic to peanuts.

26:13.556 --> 26:15.989
<i>She hates getting her hair cut.</i>

26:17.653 --> 26:19.925
I promised her a tree house.

26:23.605 --> 26:26.197
<i>Fucking</i>
<i>shoot me! Shoot me!</i>

26:26.293 --> 26:27.798
Tell me what's happened--

26:31.093 --> 26:32.149
Hello?

26:34.229 --> 26:35.221
Hello?

26:35.957 --> 26:36.917
Hello?

26:52.949 --> 26:56.213
Now, you tell me,
what has your father done?

27:27.669 --> 27:29.877
Get your things. We leave
in five minutes.

28:14.069 --> 28:16.469
I-It wasn't supposed
to go down that way, sir.

28:16.565 --> 28:18.166
You-- You cocksucker!

28:18.549 --> 28:20.469
Are you fucking crazy?

28:21.236 --> 28:22.773
Are you fucking nuts?

28:23.541 --> 28:26.357
How fucking dare you, you
motherfucker!

28:26.965 --> 28:28.853
You fucking asshole!

28:33.526 --> 28:34.901
It got away from us.

28:35.605 --> 28:37.174
But I'll take care of it.

28:37.270 --> 28:38.965
I'll fix it. I'll fix it.

28:39.061 --> 28:41.269
What are you, Merlin the fucking
Magician?

28:41.365 --> 28:42.773
How you gonna fix it?

28:42.869 --> 28:44.309
We'll hit the Aryans.

28:46.069 --> 28:47.285
I'll find his daughter.

28:47.798 --> 28:50.357
She's only eight, so I don't
think she'll be any sort of--

28:51.956 --> 28:53.941
He was protecting her.

28:56.566 --> 28:58.741
You should have kids, Vic.

28:59.765 --> 29:01.525
You'd do anything for family.

29:03.254 --> 29:04.725
You should find her.

29:07.605 --> 29:08.629
Good?

29:09.589 --> 29:10.581
Good.

29:11.573 --> 29:12.565
Okay.

29:14.036 --> 29:15.221
Right, then. Well--

29:17.876 --> 29:20.021
You know I--
I depend on you, Vic.

29:20.374 --> 29:21.716
Yeah, I know.

29:24.469 --> 29:26.165
But you're just not family.

29:31.541 --> 29:32.533
Find her.

29:49.110 --> 29:50.165
Hang on. Hang on.

30:00.437 --> 30:01.493
Stay here.

30:04.341 --> 30:05.462
Stay here.

31:23.957 --> 31:26.134
I told you to stay
outside, didn't I?

31:43.445 --> 31:44.725
All right.

31:45.781 --> 31:47.029
Just pack light.

32:01.782 --> 32:02.710
Excuse me?

32:04.598 --> 32:05.845
You know my son.

32:09.174 --> 32:10.549
You're Pete's dad?

32:16.790 --> 32:19.830
I watch Delfi
sometimes when he works late.

32:20.309 --> 32:21.654
Drive her to school.

32:31.414 --> 32:32.405
When?

32:37.366 --> 32:40.629
Her car was hit by
an old lady having aeart attack.

32:41.269 --> 32:43.030
Delfi was in the back seat.

32:43.862 --> 32:47.413
Her mother wasn't wearing her
eat belt and she...

32:47.989 --> 32:49.654
She stopped talking that day.

32:55.574 --> 32:56.885
Hmm.

33:01.461 --> 33:02.966
Can I leave her with you?

33:03.349 --> 33:04.533
I'm sorry?

33:04.918 --> 33:06.261
I-I can pay you.

33:07.062 --> 33:08.598
It's not about money.

33:09.236 --> 33:10.805
I mean, she's your blood.

34:10.933 --> 34:11.989
Let's go.

34:32.693 --> 34:34.324
<i>You say you heard a</i>
<i>gunshot?</i>

34:34.422 --> 34:35.701
<i>.38 caliber, yeah.</i>

34:35.797 --> 34:37.014
<i>Was anyone shot?</i>

34:37.110 --> 34:38.262
I don't know.

34:38.358 --> 34:40.693
Then how do you know
your son was in danger?

34:41.429 --> 34:44.405
Because I heard a gunshot.

34:45.974 --> 34:47.382
Was anything missing?

34:47.478 --> 34:48.469
I doubt it.

34:49.141 --> 34:51.286
Must be end of the month, huh?
Gotta make quota.

34:51.382 --> 34:53.590
Work, work, work, work. Hey.

34:53.686 --> 34:54.900
Come on, let's go.

34:56.118 --> 34:57.365
Date of birth?

34:57.942 --> 34:59.893
1983.

35:02.902 --> 35:04.150
Spring. April.

35:04.597 --> 35:06.902
Well, your son
doesn't have a record.

35:07.316 --> 35:08.630
Your son married?

35:09.109 --> 35:10.293
I don't know.

35:11.093 --> 35:12.406
Girlfriend?

35:12.949 --> 35:14.197
I don't know.

35:14.582 --> 35:16.916
Any friends? Acquaintances?

35:17.366 --> 35:18.485
Pets?

35:19.990 --> 35:22.134
Are you sure he's
even your son?

35:23.190 --> 35:24.182
Sir?

35:25.366 --> 35:27.445
There's really not much to go on
here.

35:30.356 --> 35:31.542
Let's go.

35:33.430 --> 35:34.422
Hey.

35:34.805 --> 35:37.718
You said it was a .38 caliber,
how'd you know that?

35:38.101 --> 35:40.470
I told you. I heard it.

35:49.653 --> 35:51.509
I see someone's
enjoying their sundae.

35:51.605 --> 35:53.686
And you're sure
you don't need anything else?

35:54.038 --> 35:55.413
Just the check, please.

36:12.406 --> 36:13.750
Go pee.

36:14.102 --> 36:15.476
I'm not stopping later.

36:29.622 --> 36:31.158
Whenever you're ready.

36:39.926 --> 36:41.142
Okay, you finish up.

36:41.846 --> 36:45.205
I'm gonna get the truck.
Outside in five minutes.

36:46.646 --> 36:48.053
Lunch is on you.

36:49.013 --> 36:50.518
I know you're good for it.

37:36.116 --> 37:37.366
That's my son.

37:42.198 --> 37:43.382
Can I, uh...

37:44.854 --> 37:46.549
Can I have a-- a moment, please?

37:46.933 --> 37:48.918
Of course. Take your time.

38:14.902 --> 38:17.430
Milky, I wanna unload the whole
thing.

38:36.438 --> 38:38.006
Your father wasn't in there.

38:42.934 --> 38:44.438
Look, kid, I'm not gonna lie.

38:45.078 --> 38:46.646
The chances he's alive are...

38:48.117 --> 38:50.901
You know, until we see the body,
we can't know for sure.

38:53.494 --> 38:54.485
Hey.

38:55.414 --> 38:56.982
Don't cry. Not yet.

38:57.942 --> 38:59.862
You can cry when we're done.

39:12.758 --> 39:13.846
<i>Hello, ladies.</i>

39:14.390 --> 39:16.278
- Hey, babe. You wanna go out?
- How you doing?

39:16.374 --> 39:17.974
Wonder if I can get
some information?

39:18.070 --> 39:19.766
Yeah, what do you want?

39:36.406 --> 39:37.398
Yes.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.542
- Go down on the shoreline.
- Right.

39:39.894 --> 39:41.078
First left.

39:41.686 --> 39:42.870
Then straight.

40:52.438 --> 40:53.750
What's this?

40:57.846 --> 41:00.694
Why don't you take those
dentures out and suck my dick?

41:21.462 --> 41:23.606
Oh. Oh, shit. No. Hey. Hey, man.

41:23.702 --> 41:25.494
No, I'm-- Oh, man.

41:25.590 --> 41:27.477
I'm so sorry I said those mean
things.

41:27.574 --> 41:28.598
I didn't mean it.

41:28.693 --> 41:31.190
No. That was rude
and I apologize.

41:32.182 --> 41:33.462
You wanna share, man?

41:33.878 --> 41:34.870
You wanna share?

41:35.222 --> 41:36.662
You know what it is, right?

41:37.590 --> 41:39.542
Yeah, man, that's Nova.

41:39.957 --> 41:42.806
Rolls-Royce of scag.
No one can get any right now.

41:42.902 --> 41:44.662
That makes you prom king.

41:45.142 --> 41:46.198
Milky?

41:47.447 --> 41:48.662
You know that name?

41:49.462 --> 41:51.766
Oh, shit. Uh, you a cop?

41:53.014 --> 41:54.230
I'm a baker.

41:56.854 --> 41:59.062
What? A baker?

42:02.070 --> 42:03.957
Oh, wait. No, no. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

42:04.054 --> 42:06.133
Hey, hey. Milky the drug dealer,
right?

42:06.230 --> 42:08.694
Yeah, no. I know him.
I do, um...

42:09.462 --> 42:12.886
At the park at Elm and Fifth.
That's where he slings, man.

42:17.526 --> 42:19.638
Hey! Come on.
Come on.

42:58.582 --> 43:00.054
Hey, baker.

43:00.630 --> 43:02.390
Where's the fucking pink shit?

43:04.022 --> 43:05.366
Stay the fuck down.

43:06.422 --> 43:07.670
Is that your truck? Huh?

43:07.766 --> 43:09.206
That truck
over there?

43:09.302 --> 43:10.614
Fucking check it out.

43:13.206 --> 43:14.711
Where's the pink shit?

43:18.679 --> 43:20.053
Stay the fuck down.

43:50.838 --> 43:52.054
Open up.

43:54.357 --> 43:55.734
Open the door.

44:00.598 --> 44:01.686
It's me.

44:02.037 --> 44:03.222
Open the door.

44:23.895 --> 44:25.366
Some things might happen.

44:27.030 --> 44:29.046
Some things you don't wanna see.

44:29.814 --> 44:32.086
When that happens, you put these
down.

44:33.590 --> 44:36.150
Turn your music all the way up,
you understand?

44:42.294 --> 44:43.478
Good.

44:59.830 --> 45:02.166
<i>I just need a credit</i>
<i>card to complete your booking.</i>

45:02.263 --> 45:03.510
I'll pay cash.

45:03.862 --> 45:04.854
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

45:04.950 --> 45:07.510
We require a credit card
to complete the booking.

45:08.182 --> 45:09.783
Well, I don't have
a credit card.

45:16.342 --> 45:19.383
Okay. Mr. Selinsky.

45:19.479 --> 45:20.982
Am I saying that correctly?

45:21.495 --> 45:22.519
Perfect.

46:07.575 --> 46:08.822
What are you doing?

46:19.542 --> 46:22.294
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm all right. I'm all right.

46:29.014 --> 46:30.423
Look at these nails.

46:34.614 --> 46:35.798
Nails trim.

46:36.375 --> 46:38.166
No loose hairs. No baggy pants.

46:38.517 --> 46:39.766
No jewelry.

46:41.782 --> 46:43.926
Don't wanna give 'em
any advantage.

46:45.174 --> 46:46.358
Understand?

47:00.246 --> 47:01.430
How old is he?

47:02.517 --> 47:05.366
Uh, I don't
know. Maybe 18.

47:08.310 --> 47:09.687
What's his name?

47:09.943 --> 47:13.110
I don't know what his real name
was, Vic. Maybe Trevor or Trent.

47:19.383 --> 47:20.662
Trevor.

47:21.654 --> 47:22.966
Trent.

47:27.382 --> 47:28.790
Maybe 18.

47:32.855 --> 47:33.846
What a waste.

47:42.647 --> 47:43.830
You know...

47:48.087 --> 47:49.206
...we killed this kid.

47:51.126 --> 47:52.823
My guy pulled the trigger.

47:54.262 --> 47:55.926
But he's my responsibility.

47:58.166 --> 47:59.382
That kid...

48:00.759 --> 48:01.910
was yours.

48:02.037 --> 48:03.415
Look, I don't know what
you want me to say, Vic.

48:03.511 --> 48:05.399
Do you want me to say I killed
him? Fine, I killed him.

48:05.495 --> 48:07.830
I already told you everything
I know, man. All right?

48:07.926 --> 48:10.199
I told you it was fucking Tarrow
and those guys.

48:10.295 --> 48:12.758
They're the ones who hit the
airport, not me.

48:14.263 --> 48:15.477
What about the pink?

48:16.151 --> 48:19.382
Okay, look, this is gonna
sound kind of fucked,

48:19.478 --> 48:22.775
but there's talk of this guy,
this old guy.

48:23.254 --> 48:25.238
He's going around town
with some of the pink.

48:25.333 --> 48:26.870
He calls himself "the Baker."

48:26.966 --> 48:28.471
- The Baker?
- Yeah.

48:28.566 --> 48:29.687
Who is this Baker?

48:30.102 --> 48:32.662
I don't know who the Baker is,
Vic, I swear. That's all I know.

48:32.757 --> 48:34.966
Okay, please, please
don't kill me.

48:35.574 --> 48:37.686
Come on. Please
don't kill me.

48:38.742 --> 48:40.758
I need your help to
send a message.

48:41.207 --> 48:42.135
No, no, no! Don't!

49:03.095 --> 49:04.437
Tell...

49:05.143 --> 49:06.326
fucking...

49:07.222 --> 49:08.502
everyone.

49:08.599 --> 49:11.062
The Merchant wants what's his.

49:12.117 --> 49:17.271
Now, if death to you
and all you know and love...

49:19.093 --> 49:20.918
isn't motivation enough...

49:23.893 --> 49:25.175
ten G's...

49:27.638 --> 49:29.430
to whoever finds this Baker guy.

49:31.542 --> 49:32.791
Go on.

49:32.983 --> 49:34.903
You heard him,
get the fuck outta here. Go.

49:35.254 --> 49:37.014
- Go.
- Go. Get the fuck out.

49:41.335 --> 49:42.710
Fuck me.

50:43.478 --> 50:45.142
In the truck, brat.

50:55.543 --> 50:57.175
Give them the honeymoon suite.

50:58.455 --> 50:59.670
Possession.

50:59.991 --> 51:01.047
Who tuned them up?

51:02.103 --> 51:06.006
I don't know. Some bullshit story about
an old geezer who straight up waxed them.

51:06.807 --> 51:07.863
Witnesses?

51:08.855 --> 51:10.423
Maybe a kid in a bread truck.

51:23.351 --> 51:27.063
Rispoli, find out who
Peter Stanton's father is.

51:28.566 --> 51:29.366
Who?

51:36.054 --> 51:36.982
Looking for a bag.

51:37.077 --> 51:38.870
Get the fuck outta here.

51:51.831 --> 51:52.919
Now we wait.

52:00.950 --> 52:01.942
Yeah?

52:02.327 --> 52:05.207
<i>Peter Stanton,</i>
<i>born April 17th, 1983.</i>

52:05.303 --> 52:06.295
I need the father.

52:06.391 --> 52:07.575
Can't do it.

52:07.670 --> 52:09.431
<i>What do
you mean you can't?</i>

52:09.527 --> 52:10.934
It's redacted.

52:12.343 --> 52:14.103
Who the fuck is this guy?

52:53.750 --> 52:55.797
You stay in the truck, no matter
what.

52:56.151 --> 52:58.743
All right? You keep the doors
locked until I get back.

52:58.839 --> 53:00.854
Don't open them for anybody.

53:00.951 --> 53:02.039
Promise me.

53:36.117 --> 53:37.271
What?

53:37.367 --> 53:38.902
Don't take me on.

53:38.997 --> 53:40.822
- Where is it, man?
- Yo. What the fuck?

53:40.917 --> 53:42.742
- Yo. What the fuck?
- Where? Look at me.

53:42.837 --> 53:44.023
- Where?
- What?

53:44.375 --> 53:45.366
Back off, man.

53:45.463 --> 53:46.455
The fuck are you--

53:46.550 --> 53:47.735
Give it back.

53:48.951 --> 53:50.295
How many
times I gotta--

53:50.390 --> 53:52.535
- I didn't do shit.
- How many--

53:53.687 --> 53:55.863
Who is it?

54:04.503 --> 54:05.495
The fuck?

54:10.550 --> 54:12.502
Shh.

54:13.591 --> 54:15.350
I'll do all the talking.

54:16.310 --> 54:17.815
Shh.

54:20.278 --> 54:22.263
There's $300 in
that box out there.

54:22.359 --> 54:24.054
Tell me what I want to know,
it's all yours.

54:24.151 --> 54:25.783
Who the fuck are you, bro?

54:25.879 --> 54:26.998
Where is Peter Stanton?

54:27.095 --> 54:29.655
Who? I don't know Peter, man.

54:29.750 --> 54:31.543
He called you three days ago.

54:31.639 --> 54:35.095
Oh, you are so fucking dead old
man. I'm gonna fucking--

54:35.991 --> 54:37.335
- Seriously.
- Fuck, man.

54:37.430 --> 54:38.935
- It's only 20 bucks.
- Pay up, man.

54:39.927 --> 54:41.431
Fuck me.

54:45.655 --> 54:47.895
I don't fucking know where he
is, man.

54:47.990 --> 54:49.175
Fuck!

54:50.294 --> 54:52.183
You got a lot of piercings, son.

54:52.279 --> 54:53.591
- And I got a lot of time.
- No!

54:53.687 --> 54:54.999
Wait. Wait a second. Okay,
I know Pete.

54:55.094 --> 54:56.375
Okay. He buys weed off me,

54:56.471 --> 54:58.550
some-fucking-times,
and he buys E off me, sometimes.

54:58.647 --> 54:59.671
That's it, bro.

54:59.767 --> 55:01.399
He called you about this, right?

55:01.494 --> 55:02.551
I mean-- I--

55:02.647 --> 55:04.567
Okay, listen. Listen,
he called me.

55:04.663 --> 55:06.839
He said he had a bunch of pink
that he wanted me to move up.

55:06.935 --> 55:08.503
I said I'd kick it up the
ladder. That's all.

55:08.599 --> 55:11.766
- Up to who?
- Sirko. My fucking supplier.

55:12.247 --> 55:13.783
He owns this nightclub
called Lily's.

55:14.487 --> 55:16.983
A big guy, Ukrainian, weird
fucking teeth.

55:18.775 --> 55:20.855
Goggles!

55:53.398 --> 55:55.926
I said stay
in the goddamn truck, didn't I?

55:56.663 --> 55:57.751
You promised!

56:00.695 --> 56:02.359
You could've been killed.

56:35.415 --> 56:36.727
We need to eat.

57:38.423 --> 57:39.415
No.

57:40.375 --> 57:41.751
You don't do that.

57:42.583 --> 57:43.767
Never again.

58:27.031 --> 58:28.439
<i>That's my baby girl.</i>

59:00.087 --> 59:01.143
Hey.

59:02.135 --> 59:03.831
Your lawn needs watering.

59:04.375 --> 59:06.039
You have to take care of these
things.

59:06.136 --> 59:07.318
Okay.

59:08.759 --> 59:09.912
Ian.

59:10.008 --> 59:11.191
James.

59:21.079 --> 59:22.071
Um...

59:22.775 --> 59:24.983
- Last night...
- I heard. I heard.

59:25.079 --> 59:26.422
You were shaky.

59:27.703 --> 59:30.231
Shaky isn't dependable, Vic.

59:39.958 --> 59:42.007
I know, what you do,

59:42.775 --> 59:43.991
it's hard.

59:45.815 --> 59:47.703
Old men wage their little wars,

59:47.799 --> 59:49.943
but it's the young men who fight
them.

59:52.887 --> 59:55.447
You used to spoil
for a fight, Vic.

59:58.231 --> 59:59.960
But now not so much.

01:00:00.055 --> 01:00:01.334
We change.

01:00:02.583 --> 01:00:04.023
What do you want now?

01:00:04.503 --> 01:00:05.943
Forgiveness?

01:00:07.287 --> 01:00:08.727
No. I'm fine.

01:00:10.424 --> 01:00:12.023
You look worried.

01:00:13.304 --> 01:00:14.774
Worried about what?

01:00:16.599 --> 01:00:18.358
What's already in the past?

01:00:21.303 --> 01:00:23.255
What God might think?

01:00:24.247 --> 01:00:27.031
Well, I'm pretty sure God's
made up his mind about me.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.959
Don't worry about the God
who has already condemned you.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.615
Worry about the
man in your kitchen...

01:00:35.607 --> 01:00:37.719
who has yet to make up his mind.

01:00:43.831 --> 01:00:45.751
I need you dependable, Vic.

01:00:50.551 --> 01:00:52.214
I'm dependable.

01:00:58.039 --> 01:00:59.224
We'll see.

01:01:14.998 --> 01:01:17.527
Your dad, he didn't like
mushrooms either.

01:01:18.295 --> 01:01:19.351
One time--

01:01:19.895 --> 01:01:22.167
I guess your father was
around your age--

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.854
I took him mushroom hunting.

01:01:26.136 --> 01:01:27.320
<i>I used to like that.</i>

01:01:27.415 --> 01:01:28.887
<i>It cleared my head.</i>

01:01:31.032 --> 01:01:32.567
Anyway, I gave him this bell,

01:01:32.887 --> 01:01:35.062
you know, like the kind you might put
around a goat's neck, and I says to him,

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:36.535
and I says to him,

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.095
<i>"Look, if you get lost, you
ring the bell. I'll come find you."</i>

01:01:39.191 --> 01:01:41.943
<i>So anyway, I set off</i>
<i>into the woods,</i>

01:01:43.127 --> 01:01:45.175
and, man, it must have
been my lucky day,

01:01:45.271 --> 01:01:47.863
'cause I'm finding mushroom
after mushroom.

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:50.039
I'm filling my bag,

01:01:50.422 --> 01:01:54.519
and all of a sudden, I realize I
don't see your father anywhere.

01:01:55.318 --> 01:01:57.591
So I started calling
out his name...

01:01:58.135 --> 01:01:59.447
nothing.

01:01:59.832 --> 01:02:02.135
So now I start
retracing my steps.

01:02:02.487 --> 01:02:03.480
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:02:04.407 --> 01:02:05.464
Now,

01:02:06.071 --> 01:02:08.311
I'm starting to imagine
having to tell your grandmother

01:02:08.407 --> 01:02:10.039
I lost our kid in the woods.

01:02:13.047 --> 01:02:14.167
Anyway...

01:02:14.903 --> 01:02:17.398
I get back to where we started,
and there he is.

01:02:18.168 --> 01:02:21.399
<i>Just sitting there, playing
with some lizard he found.</i>

01:02:22.423 --> 01:02:25.015
And I was so relieved,
I forgot how furious I was,

01:02:25.111 --> 01:02:26.616
but I said to him,

01:02:26.712 --> 01:02:28.407
"Why didn't you ring the bell?"

01:02:29.047 --> 01:02:30.616
You know what he said?

01:02:30.711 --> 01:02:32.280
<i>"I wasn't lost."</i>

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:38.008
Anyway...

01:02:39.478 --> 01:02:41.367
he didn't like mushrooms either.

01:02:43.607 --> 01:02:47.543
"It was fortunate the Tin Woodman
had no heart at that moment,

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:50.071
for it would have beat loud
and fast from terror.

01:02:50.871 --> 01:02:55.288
But being only tin, the
Woodman was not at all afraid."

01:04:29.911 --> 01:04:31.159
What do you need?

01:04:33.655 --> 01:04:34.903
Right away.

01:04:37.462 --> 01:04:38.711
Cheers.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:50.103
Motherfucker!

01:05:16.855 --> 01:05:19.320
- <i>Kopyshche.</i>
- <i>Da.</i>

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:27.928
<i>Dobre.</i>

01:06:12.376 --> 01:06:14.040
Who the
fuck are you?

01:06:15.064 --> 01:06:16.760
I'm looking for my son.

01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:21.751
And who the fuck is your son?

01:06:29.368 --> 01:06:31.224
So you're the old man.

01:06:32.568 --> 01:06:33.879
"The Baker."

01:06:34.136 --> 01:06:36.984
There is ten grand bounty
on your head.

01:06:37.751 --> 01:06:39.991
And you're the guy
that's gonna collect it, right?

01:06:40.535 --> 01:06:42.487
I will not kill you for money.

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:13.591
Where's my son?

01:07:18.807 --> 01:07:20.152
Your son is dead.

01:07:26.008 --> 01:07:27.575
You've seen the body?

01:07:29.335 --> 01:07:30.904
I helped to bury him.

01:07:32.791 --> 01:07:33.880
Who killed him?

01:07:33.976 --> 01:07:36.344
Your son killed himself.

01:08:33.591 --> 01:08:34.968
We're done here.

01:08:36.376 --> 01:08:37.558
It's over.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.046
What?

01:08:47.415 --> 01:08:49.240
Chances he's alive are...

01:08:51.031 --> 01:08:52.470
I don't know.

01:08:55.576 --> 01:08:56.758
It's over.

01:08:58.456 --> 01:09:00.024
Hey. Hey.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:01.176
Hey!

01:09:01.272 --> 01:09:02.968
Hey. Calm down.

01:09:03.064 --> 01:09:04.184
Calm down.

01:09:04.279 --> 01:09:05.911
Breathe. Breathe.

01:09:06.006 --> 01:09:07.863
Breathe. Look at me.

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.015
You see this?

01:09:09.111 --> 01:09:10.198
You see this long hand?

01:09:10.296 --> 01:09:12.022
See how slow and
steady it moves?

01:09:12.118 --> 01:09:13.942
Watch it. Watch it.

01:09:14.037 --> 01:09:15.862
Look at me. Look at me.

01:09:16.376 --> 01:09:18.008
Look at me. Look at me.

01:09:18.104 --> 01:09:20.727
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me.

01:09:22.615 --> 01:09:23.863
Breathe.

01:09:24.216 --> 01:09:25.207
Breathe.

01:09:25.304 --> 01:09:26.935
Look at the long hand.

01:09:27.031 --> 01:09:28.055
Look at it.

01:09:28.152 --> 01:09:29.335
Look at it.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.608
You're okay.

01:09:32.278 --> 01:09:33.688
You're okay.

01:09:35.062 --> 01:09:36.439
You're okay.

01:09:44.087 --> 01:09:45.367
Good girl.

01:09:55.128 --> 01:09:56.696
We gotta leave in the morning.

01:09:58.744 --> 01:10:00.118
Bright and early.

01:10:03.224 --> 01:10:05.240
Yeah, no. Do
you recall anything?

01:10:05.336 --> 01:10:06.680
- I didn't see any--
- Yeah.

01:10:06.775 --> 01:10:08.248
Just shots, like pop, pop.

01:10:13.815 --> 01:10:15.832
- You see that?
- Yep.

01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:21.528
That's Sirko. 1:14 a.m.

01:10:22.968 --> 01:10:24.312
Four minutes later...

01:10:26.392 --> 01:10:28.504
I ran this frame by frame a few
times.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:29.656
No clear face shot.

01:10:30.135 --> 01:10:32.055
He knew where the cameras were.

01:10:34.168 --> 01:10:36.696
-Let me know if you find
anything else. -Yeah.

01:12:02.104 --> 01:12:04.280
Your grandmother's
name was Delfi.

01:12:05.527 --> 01:12:06.968
Did you know that?

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:13.656
You also have her...

01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:16.632
tight way of smiling.

01:12:25.048 --> 01:12:26.328
Let's go home.

01:12:30.776 --> 01:12:31.928
Okay?

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:34.231
Hey.

01:12:34.327 --> 01:12:35.639
You pack up.

01:12:37.336 --> 01:12:38.968
I'm gonna go around the corner,

01:12:39.704 --> 01:12:41.432
get some stuff for the road.

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:43.672
Maybe some real coffee.

01:12:44.216 --> 01:12:45.495
You want some?

01:13:03.352 --> 01:13:04.536
Hey.

01:13:04.984 --> 01:13:06.648
I think I just found your baker.

01:13:23.096 --> 01:13:24.599
Have you seen this guy?

01:14:27.959 --> 01:14:30.487
- Anything?
- No. Clear.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:04.920
Got something.

01:15:15.352 --> 01:15:16.792
- Fuck.
- Go.

01:15:20.248 --> 01:15:21.271
Fuck!

01:15:38.008 --> 01:15:39.288
Open the door!

01:15:39.384 --> 01:15:41.208
Open the door! Hey!

01:15:46.136 --> 01:15:47.543
Open the door! Hey!

01:15:47.639 --> 01:15:49.496
Hey. Come on.

01:17:32.696 --> 01:17:33.817
Hey, brat.

01:17:36.344 --> 01:17:37.368
Not yet.

01:17:39.577 --> 01:17:40.568
Not yet.

01:18:23.256 --> 01:18:26.360
Can you-- The line and the hook,
please.

01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:35.768
You know, there's a...

01:18:38.265 --> 01:18:44.216
a giant oak tree
behind the bakery.

01:18:46.136 --> 01:18:49.016
Make a beautiful tree house.

01:19:16.088 --> 01:19:18.392
What? What is it?

01:19:25.848 --> 01:19:29.368
Body temp 103. BP
80 over 60 and dropping steady.

01:19:29.464 --> 01:19:31.352
Right, let's get
that wound cleaned up.

01:19:31.448 --> 01:19:33.017
Nurse Jibbs, get her
out of here.

01:19:33.432 --> 01:19:35.159
Come with me. Come on.

01:19:35.256 --> 01:19:36.440
It's okay.

01:19:36.537 --> 01:19:38.521
It will be okay.

01:19:41.305 --> 01:19:43.225
VIN number's been
chiseled off.

01:19:43.736 --> 01:19:44.792
Plates?

01:19:44.888 --> 01:19:47.832
Yeah, registered to a
Donald Gilroy.

01:19:48.632 --> 01:19:50.680
So what do we have
on this Gilroy?

01:19:50.775 --> 01:19:55.608
Uh. That's just it.
Donald Gilroy died 26 years ago.

01:19:57.528 --> 01:19:59.641
<i>All units, we got</i>
<i>a 911 call.</i>

01:19:59.737 --> 01:20:02.999
<i>Older white male, matches the
description of the double homicide,</i>

01:20:03.096 --> 01:20:05.848

Ow! Ow. Ow.

01:20:43.416 --> 01:20:45.112
Take it easy, take it easy.

01:20:48.601 --> 01:20:49.976
You're not hurt?

01:20:58.137 --> 01:20:59.192
Ah.

01:21:00.568 --> 01:21:01.913
Good girl.

01:21:11.961 --> 01:21:13.144
Mmm.

01:21:13.657 --> 01:21:15.255
You must be pretty hungry, huh?

01:21:16.697 --> 01:21:18.361
What'd they do with my pants?

01:21:20.952 --> 01:21:21.880
Okay.

01:21:22.425 --> 01:21:25.463
Take some money from the pocket
and go get us both a chocolate bar.

01:21:29.017 --> 01:21:30.552
And no peanuts.

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:53.560

<i>307. Dr. Singh, call 307.</i>

You're with him, right?

01:22:35.225 --> 01:22:36.728
The Baker?

01:22:38.233 --> 01:22:39.544
I need to see him.

01:22:40.217 --> 01:22:41.464
It's important.

01:22:44.216 --> 01:22:45.496
Can you help me?

01:22:48.569 --> 01:22:49.625
Good girl.

01:23:10.425 --> 01:23:12.952
Looking for an old guy with
a little girl.

01:23:30.392 --> 01:23:34.521
<i>Dr. Carter to
Admitting, please. Dr. Carter to Admitting.</i>

01:23:36.632 --> 01:23:37.688
Good girl.

01:23:56.152 --> 01:23:57.496
Fuck!

01:24:37.945 --> 01:24:39.929
<i>Paging</i>
<i>Dr. Bechter--</i>

01:24:43.065 --> 01:24:44.665
Freeze.

01:25:18.105 --> 01:25:21.209
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>Code gray, sixth floor.</i>

01:25:41.657 --> 01:25:43.129
Stop.

01:25:44.537 --> 01:25:46.041
Old man, stab wound?

01:25:46.137 --> 01:25:47.673
- Yeah, 607.
- 607.

01:25:50.745 --> 01:25:53.817
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>Code gray, sixth floor.</i>

01:25:53.912 --> 01:25:56.279
<i>Code gray, sixth floor.</i>

01:25:59.063 --> 01:26:00.697
- Down this way.
- Got it.

01:26:42.841 --> 01:26:44.183
Fuck.

01:26:55.769 --> 01:26:57.785
Do you know how to send a
message back?

01:28:11.097 --> 01:28:13.464
You sure you know
how to handle that thing?

01:28:18.553 --> 01:28:19.673
You mean the Beretta M9?

01:28:19.769 --> 01:28:23.481
Short recoil, 15 round,
staggered mag,

01:28:23.897 --> 01:28:26.073
semi-automatic, nine millimeter?

01:28:26.841 --> 01:28:31.065
Pistol of choice for the US military
from Kosovo to the Afghan mountains?

01:28:32.537 --> 01:28:35.001
And most recently used to murder
my son?

01:28:38.841 --> 01:28:41.625
Yeah, I do.

01:28:45.177 --> 01:28:46.456
Take me to him.

01:28:46.777 --> 01:28:49.625

Hey.

01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:22.905

01:30:36.281 --> 01:30:37.560
On your knees.

Wherever you go...

01:30:50.233 --> 01:30:51.897
the Merchant will find you.

01:30:52.698 --> 01:30:53.945
Merchant?

01:30:57.016 --> 01:30:59.192
You know, for what it's worth...

01:31:00.856 --> 01:31:04.952
your boy died thinking, not
about himself...

01:31:06.872 --> 01:31:08.217
but about his little girl.

01:31:11.866 --> 01:31:13.369
How she liked green grapes.

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:17.337
And how they were gonna
make a tree house together.

01:31:31.385 --> 01:31:34.360
Do it. Please, just pull--

01:32:53.784 --> 01:32:55.065
You can cry now.

01:32:57.498 --> 01:32:59.065
It's okay to cry now.

01:33:26.041 --> 01:33:27.032
Give me that.

01:33:27.129 --> 01:33:28.313
Arms up.

01:33:31.801 --> 01:33:33.177
Enough of that. All right.

01:33:36.249 --> 01:33:37.433
Bring us some tea.

01:34:02.265 --> 01:34:04.345
The butcher becomes the Baker.

01:34:07.096 --> 01:34:08.953
Some things change, some don't.

01:34:12.409 --> 01:34:13.945
I thought you were dead.

01:34:16.825 --> 01:34:17.817
I was.

01:34:39.417 --> 01:34:40.825
What your son did,

01:34:41.465 --> 01:34:43.289
what you have done,

01:34:43.994 --> 01:34:45.433
has cost me.

01:34:51.929 --> 01:34:53.305
Cost me more.

01:35:06.969 --> 01:35:08.280
Go.

01:35:53.946 --> 01:35:55.353
I like this song.
