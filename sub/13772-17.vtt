You're the one
who invited your friend over.

00:03.699 --> 00:06.093
Now that he's here, you can't
just suddenly change your mind.

00:06.180 --> 00:08.617
Now get up and be nice to Ryan.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.055
Fine.

Oh, yeah?

01:01.583 --> 01:03.019
Well, I read a book
about poker tells,

01:03.106 --> 01:05.282
and my eyes have been
giving away my cards.

01:05.369 --> 01:06.327
We'll see who looks dumb

01:06.414 --> 01:07.371
when I am dancing

01:07.458 --> 01:09.547
on a mountain of poker chips.

01:10.635 --> 01:11.419
[squeaks]

01:11.506 --> 01:12.289
I'm out.

01:12.376 --> 01:13.464
Me, too.

01:13.551 --> 01:14.726
-Fold.
-Damn!

01:14.813 --> 01:16.119
Gentlemen.

01:16.206 --> 01:19.427
Fiddle Faddle!
Now it's a poker game.

01:19.514 --> 01:20.341
Easy there.

01:20.428 --> 01:21.646
Mm, I can't help it.

01:21.733 --> 01:22.821
Kitty's got me

01:22.908 --> 01:24.084
on an extreme diet.

01:24.171 --> 01:25.215
Hey, this isn't
Fiddle Faddle.

01:25.302 --> 01:26.651
I make it at home.

01:26.738 --> 01:28.653
I pop some corn,
brush some melted caramel on it,

01:28.740 --> 01:29.828
let it cure,

01:29.915 --> 01:31.917
blanch and double
roast the nuts.

01:32.004 --> 01:34.746
You lose a weekend,
but you save 73 cents a batch.

01:34.833 --> 01:36.618
[squeaks]
I'll bet a buck.

01:36.705 --> 01:37.706
-I'm out.
-ABE: Fold.

01:37.793 --> 01:38.794
Me, too.

01:38.881 --> 01:40.100
Damn, you could see

01:40.187 --> 01:42.450
through these glasses,
can't you?

01:42.537 --> 01:45.409
Oh! Oh, my tooth!

01:45.496 --> 01:47.629
Please, let the
dentist take a look.

01:47.716 --> 01:49.196
It's this one.

01:49.283 --> 01:52.286
Uh-oh, #31 is cracked.

01:52.373 --> 01:53.504
Is that important?

01:53.591 --> 01:54.984
Only for eating
and talking.

01:55.071 --> 01:56.116
It's one of the glory boys.

01:56.203 --> 01:57.639
You better get that fixed.

01:57.726 --> 01:59.249
Great.

01:59.336 --> 02:00.816
My company doesn't have
a dental plan anymore.

02:00.903 --> 02:03.210
They got us
a foosball table instead.

02:03.297 --> 02:04.428
So where you been going?

02:04.515 --> 02:06.300
The dental college.

02:06.387 --> 02:08.519
It's not too bad, but they do
make you sign a death waiver.

02:08.606 --> 02:09.520
Forget about that.

02:09.607 --> 02:11.131
Come by my office
on Monday,

02:11.218 --> 02:12.393
and I'll take care of it.

02:12.480 --> 02:13.829
-Really?
-Absolutely.

02:13.916 --> 02:15.135
Wow, it's been
so many years

02:15.222 --> 02:17.006
since I've been
to a real dentist.

02:17.093 --> 02:20.183
Do you supply the ether rag,
or should I bring my own?

02:21.837 --> 02:23.491
REESE: God, I'm so bored.

02:23.578 --> 02:25.232
Everything's boring.

02:25.319 --> 02:28.104
It makes ditching school
almost seem like a bad choice.

02:28.191 --> 02:30.933
Even talking about boring
is getting boring.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.022
Yeah, boring.

02:33.109 --> 02:35.633
Bored, bored, bored, bored...

02:35.720 --> 02:37.418
Wait! You see that?

02:37.505 --> 02:39.333
-What?
-It's a dead squirrel!

02:39.420 --> 02:41.161
Gentlemen, our week
just filled up.

02:41.248 --> 02:43.032
Sorry, not interested.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.991
Sure, it looks good to you now,
but it's just going

02:46.078 --> 02:47.602
to wind up in the closet
with all the others.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.125
Pass.

02:49.212 --> 02:50.561
Your loss.

02:50.648 --> 02:52.694
See you, suckers.

02:56.306 --> 02:58.395
WOMAN: Okay, okay.
Ahem.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.444
-Mom?
-[gasps]

03:03.531 --> 03:05.620
Why aren't you in school?

03:05.707 --> 03:07.578
You're in trouble, young man!

03:07.665 --> 03:09.711
Oh, I don't think so.

03:09.798 --> 03:11.191
You're in the
middle of an alley

03:11.278 --> 03:12.409
trying to get on a bike.

03:12.496 --> 03:13.497
You are ashamed
of something.

03:13.584 --> 03:15.238
I can always smell shame.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.371
It's kind of like
rotten coconut.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.242
Okay.

03:19.329 --> 03:21.897
There's this
stupid bike-a-thon at work.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.594
Some idiot made a big stink

03:23.681 --> 03:25.161
about how the store's
not doing enough for charity.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.163
-Then don't do it.
-I have to.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.252
I'm the idiot.

03:29.339 --> 03:32.429
And I... I...

03:36.041 --> 03:37.652
I can't ride a bike...

03:37.739 --> 03:39.393
and it's very embarrassing.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.395
So you really
can't ride a bike?

03:41.482 --> 03:42.613
No.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.136
Hey, everybody!
My mom can't--

03:44.224 --> 03:46.051
[screaming]

03:46.138 --> 03:47.749
You don't understand!

03:47.836 --> 03:51.231
My father didn't believe
in training wheels!

03:51.318 --> 03:53.102
-Mom!
-He just tied me to the bike

03:53.189 --> 03:54.538
and pushed me down the hill.

03:54.625 --> 03:55.974
Mom, there's glass down here!

03:56.061 --> 03:57.454
I came back
with three teeth in my hand,

03:57.541 --> 03:59.064
and he just pushed me down
all over again.

03:59.151 --> 04:01.632
After that, I just told people
I knew how to ride.

04:01.719 --> 04:02.677
And I've been living

04:02.764 --> 04:04.374
with this lie ever since!

04:04.461 --> 04:07.812
-Mom!
-If you tell anybody,
I will kill you!

04:07.899 --> 04:10.032
-Do you hear me?
-I won't tell a soul!

04:10.119 --> 04:11.903
-Let me up, and I can help!
-What?

04:11.990 --> 04:14.254
I know how to ride a bike!
I'll teach you!

04:17.082 --> 04:18.736
You'd really do that?

04:18.822 --> 04:20.999
Absolutely. And you don't
have to be embarrassed.

04:21.086 --> 04:24.046
No one will ever find
out your horrible secret.

04:24.133 --> 04:28.877
No, lady, I don't
want your drugs!

04:29.747 --> 04:31.009
[scoffs]

04:33.185 --> 04:37.102
Wow, and I thought Reese was
the one dragging us down.

04:37.189 --> 04:39.540
Maybe we should see how
he's doing with his squirrel.

04:39.627 --> 04:42.673
If I know Reese, all
the good parts are gone by now.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.633
Nothing exciting
ever happens around here.

04:52.248 --> 04:55.643
Wow, we even have
boring miracles.

04:55.730 --> 04:58.123
It must have fallen
from a plane or something.

05:02.345 --> 05:05.261
Wow, this is brand-new.

05:05.348 --> 05:07.959
At least what I
think a mattress
would look like new.

05:08.046 --> 05:09.700
It's got no lumps.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.006
No weird stains.

05:11.093 --> 05:12.486
No springs sticking
out of it.

05:12.573 --> 05:14.314
BOTH:
It's got tags!

05:15.097 --> 05:16.403
Wow.

05:16.490 --> 05:17.926
It's like sitting
on a cloud...

05:18.013 --> 05:19.884
with two clouds
under it.

05:19.971 --> 05:21.756
Oh, this is amazing.

05:21.843 --> 05:24.541
I'm in ass heaven.

05:24.628 --> 05:25.586
Maybe it's worth
some money.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.936
Sell it or keep it?

05:28.023 --> 05:30.112
Let's think about this
for a second.

05:31.679 --> 05:33.376
[both sighing]

05:33.463 --> 05:35.987
[tires screech, horn honks]

05:36.074 --> 05:39.077
Uhh! Oh, my God,
we totally fell asleep.

05:39.164 --> 05:40.862
That wasn't sleep.

05:40.949 --> 05:43.430
Sleep makes you feel
like you've been beaten up.

05:43.517 --> 05:45.388
We gotta keep this thing.

05:47.216 --> 05:50.872
Enjoying Lord of the Rings
in high-def?

05:50.959 --> 05:53.309
Oh, it's unbelievable.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.224
No lines, no commercials...

05:55.311 --> 05:58.227
I'm bringing Lois here
for our anniversary.

05:58.314 --> 06:01.056
I still can't
get over all this.

06:01.143 --> 06:03.580
A real sink to spit in.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.930
I really don't have
to swallow it.

06:06.017 --> 06:07.105
Hal, are you crying?

06:07.192 --> 06:09.064
They're good tears.

06:09.151 --> 06:10.674
How much longer will it take?

06:10.761 --> 06:12.284
I'm done.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.634
You can't be.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.940
I didn't bite down
on the pain stick.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.812
No, it's done;
I finally got

06:17.899 --> 06:19.509
the temporary crown on.

06:19.596 --> 06:21.685
I got to tell you, Hal,
it was in pretty bad shape,

06:21.772 --> 06:25.036
but I think you're going
to be happy with the results.

06:25.123 --> 06:28.170
Wow, you really
are a friend.

06:28.257 --> 06:30.825
Two thousand dollars?!

06:30.912 --> 06:33.436
Excuse me, but this
can't be right.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.656
Trey said he would
take care of it.

06:35.743 --> 06:38.049
The doctor handed me
the bill himself.

06:38.136 --> 06:40.312
You don't understand.
I'm a friend of Trey's.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.097
And he gave you
the friend discount:

06:42.184 --> 06:43.577
ten percent.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.143
You mean he was going
to charge me more?

06:45.230 --> 06:46.362
Can I have the key
to the bathroom?

06:46.449 --> 06:47.711
Careful, it'll
cost you $200

06:47.798 --> 06:49.104
in a bathroom fee!

06:49.191 --> 06:50.192
You know what?

06:50.279 --> 06:51.715
You can tell Trey
that this is

06:51.802 --> 06:55.066
what I think of his bill.

06:55.153 --> 06:57.286
That was your
parking validation.

06:57.373 --> 06:59.810
I know.

06:59.897 --> 07:02.291
[whispering]
Could I have another one?

07:08.863 --> 07:10.517
Morning.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.998
Morning.

07:14.085 --> 07:14.956
Last night was...

07:15.043 --> 07:17.611
Fantastic.

07:17.698 --> 07:20.178
I'm glad we got these
600-thread-count sheets.

07:20.265 --> 07:21.615
Anything else
would have been an insult

07:21.702 --> 07:23.878
to this beautiful mattress.

07:23.965 --> 07:26.533
We really have been living
like beasts.

07:26.620 --> 07:27.969
[moans]

07:28.056 --> 07:29.971
A good night's sleep.

07:30.058 --> 07:31.799
Just think
what we can do

07:31.886 --> 07:33.931
with all this
new energy.

07:34.018 --> 07:36.020
Yeah.

07:40.982 --> 07:42.374
Five more minutes?

07:42.462 --> 07:43.767
I'm right behind you, buddy.

07:57.825 --> 08:00.784
-See? Just do that.
-I can't.

08:00.871 --> 08:03.700
-You want me to show you again?
-No, Reese, I'm afraid.

08:07.704 --> 08:08.966
So you're chicken, huh?

08:09.053 --> 08:11.099
-Yes!
-Oh.

08:11.186 --> 08:13.623
Mom, you might not know this,

08:13.710 --> 08:15.582
but I used to be afraid
of a lot of things.

08:15.669 --> 08:18.672
Thunder, frogs, mailboxes...

08:18.759 --> 08:20.369
You were afraid
of mailboxes?

08:20.456 --> 08:21.501
I used to imagine
that if I stuck

08:21.588 --> 08:22.893
my hand in a mailbox,

08:22.980 --> 08:24.547
it would slam shut
and rip my hand off,

08:24.634 --> 08:26.636
but I simply conquered my fear
by ripping the lid

08:26.723 --> 08:28.290
off of every mailbox
in the neighborhood.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.466
I turned that fear into hate,

08:30.553 --> 08:32.947
and you have to hate
that bike just as much.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.818
I don't have hate.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.994
You've got hate in there.
You just have to find it.

08:37.081 --> 08:39.866
-Do you hate work?
-Surprisingly, no.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.390
What about your life?

08:41.477 --> 08:43.304
Your best years are gone,
and they weren't so good.

08:43.392 --> 08:44.915
I don't hate
my life, Reese.

08:45.002 --> 08:46.134
What about the stuff
I've done to you,

08:46.221 --> 08:47.962
like when I baked your shoes,

08:48.049 --> 08:49.703
or broke
your wedding china,

08:49.790 --> 08:51.226
or when I sold those tickets
to those fifth graders

08:51.313 --> 08:52.532
to watch you shower?

08:52.619 --> 08:54.055
You did what?

08:54.142 --> 08:55.709
Perfect! Now direct
that anger to the bike!

08:55.796 --> 08:58.233
[growling]

09:11.420 --> 09:13.727
Don't let me fall!

09:13.814 --> 09:16.251
Okay, I think we've made
a lot of progress!

09:16.338 --> 09:18.296
That's enough for today!

09:19.689 --> 09:21.909
So, lately, I've been going
to the library with Mom.

09:21.996 --> 09:24.259
That's all. I don't want
anyone following us.

09:24.346 --> 09:26.217
Like I said,
it's just the library,

09:26.304 --> 09:31.005
where we do... library things.

09:31.092 --> 09:33.877
Has anyone seen
our bicycle pump?

09:33.964 --> 09:36.576
[both snoring softly]

09:36.663 --> 09:38.708
STEVE: Hal's in.
Your bet.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.623
MALIK: Five dollars?

09:40.710 --> 09:41.755
I'll call.

09:41.842 --> 09:43.583
Hi, guys,
where should I put this?

09:43.670 --> 09:45.193
I'll take care of it.

09:46.281 --> 09:47.282
-Thanks.
-Uh-huh.

09:47.369 --> 09:49.763
-Unh!
-Whoa!

09:51.634 --> 09:53.027
This is about
the dental visit, isn't it?

09:53.114 --> 09:55.072
You know, I don't recall
a dental visit.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.683
I recall a mugging!

09:56.770 --> 09:58.380
I'm surprised
you'd bring it up,

09:58.467 --> 09:59.990
considering you ran
out on the bill.

10:00.077 --> 10:01.470
-Con artist!
-Welsher!

10:01.557 --> 10:03.211
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's this about?

10:03.298 --> 10:05.866
I went to Trey to get my tooth
fixed for free like he promised,

10:05.953 --> 10:10.218
and then this pirate hands me
a bill for $2,000!

10:10.305 --> 10:12.481
Free?! I never said
I'd fix it for free!

10:12.568 --> 10:14.222
You said you'd
take care of it!

10:14.309 --> 10:16.746
And I took care of it!
I fixed it!

10:16.833 --> 10:19.053
Now Hal is walking
around here pain-free

10:19.140 --> 10:20.794
with a stolen smile!

10:20.881 --> 10:22.883
How dare you?
We were all here.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.188
Now, who's right?

10:24.275 --> 10:26.060
I think the answer
is pretty clear.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.366
-Trey.
-Hal.

10:28.453 --> 10:29.498
What are you talking about?

10:29.585 --> 10:30.891
The man said he'd
take care of it.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.762
Everyone knows
what that means.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.069
Yeah, it means
he'd fix it for free.

10:35.156 --> 10:36.461
Thank you!

10:36.548 --> 10:37.549
You're just saying that
because it was

10:37.637 --> 10:38.986
your cheap-ass caramel corn

10:39.073 --> 10:40.465
that broke his tooth
in the first place.

10:40.552 --> 10:41.815
It had nothing to do
with the caramel corn!

10:41.902 --> 10:44.426
Guys, guys, guys,
this is ruining the game.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.863
Malik, you do mediation
at your law firm.

10:46.950 --> 10:48.256
Can't you help out?

10:48.343 --> 10:51.041
Fine. Fellas, I want
you both to just sit down

10:51.128 --> 10:53.304
and listen to each other.

10:53.391 --> 10:54.958
[all muttering]

10:55.045 --> 10:57.787
Trey, can't you see
where "I'll take care of it"

10:57.874 --> 11:01.138
could be misinterpreted?

11:01.225 --> 11:02.531
Well, I suppose
it could.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.228
Yeah!

11:04.315 --> 11:08.189
And, Hal, can't you see
that Trey is a professional?

11:08.276 --> 11:10.626
He went to years
of medical school.

11:10.713 --> 11:12.454
And then he gave up
and became a dentist.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.108
[guys laughing]

11:15.805 --> 11:18.982
Trey deserves to be
compensated for his work.

11:19.069 --> 11:21.637
It's natural and it's fair.

11:21.724 --> 11:24.118
I guess it is.

11:24.205 --> 11:25.641
[sighs]

11:25.728 --> 11:27.599
I'm sorry, Trey.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.210
No offense taken.

11:33.518 --> 11:35.695
So, Malik,
how much do we owe you?

11:35.782 --> 11:37.044
Ah, nothing. We're friends.

11:37.131 --> 11:38.698
A-ha! You see?

11:38.785 --> 11:39.960
It's not the same!

11:40.047 --> 11:42.049
You came to me
as a professional.

11:42.136 --> 11:43.790
You get a salary
for your work.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.139
Imagine going to
somebody's house,

11:45.226 --> 11:47.228
playing Tetris,
shuffling papers

11:47.315 --> 11:48.751
and making long-
distance calls,

11:48.838 --> 11:50.318
and nobody paid you?!

11:50.405 --> 11:51.536
That's it!

11:51.623 --> 11:53.103
I don't want your repo thugs

11:53.190 --> 11:56.498
coming after me, so here!

11:57.891 --> 12:00.415
[shrieks]

12:03.897 --> 12:05.899
[yells]

12:12.209 --> 12:13.515
[slurred]
So, Peterson puts

12:13.602 --> 12:15.212
the report on my desk
and says, uh...

12:17.388 --> 12:18.999
[guttural noises]

12:19.086 --> 12:20.870
[gagging]

12:21.741 --> 12:24.004
[coughing]

12:24.091 --> 12:26.093
Hal, if your tooth hurts,
don't eat.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.572
I'm fine.

12:31.054 --> 12:33.274
-Hal, just stop it.
-Stop what?

12:33.361 --> 12:35.319
We're all afraid
you're going to choke to death.

12:35.406 --> 12:37.017
You can't eat if you don't chew.

12:37.104 --> 12:38.366
I don't need to chew.

12:38.453 --> 12:40.150
I am fine.

12:40.237 --> 12:42.849
The key is relaxing
the esophagus.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.981
Jamie, I hope
you're paying attention.

12:54.295 --> 12:55.949
[coughs]

12:56.036 --> 12:59.561
So, Mom, how's
the bike-a-thon going?

12:59.648 --> 13:02.390
Just great.
I'm really excited about it.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.696
You are, huh?
How long have you been riding?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.829
Long enough.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.875
Fascinating!

13:08.962 --> 13:10.920
Hey, you know what
I could go for?

13:11.007 --> 13:13.618
-Another piece of cake.
-There is no more.

13:13.705 --> 13:15.577
-What about that piece?
-My piece?

13:15.664 --> 13:16.926
That's okay.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.145
I don't need another
piece of cake.

13:18.232 --> 13:19.886
I can just continue talking.

13:19.973 --> 13:21.409
So, what was I talking about?

13:21.496 --> 13:25.369
Oh, yeah, your bike riding.

13:26.544 --> 13:28.416
These chairs
are so uncomfortable.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.940
They have no idea
how to conform to our bodies.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.380
[coughing gag]

13:38.774 --> 13:40.471
Hal, you have an infection.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.169
You have to see a dentist.

13:42.256 --> 13:44.214
I made an appointment with
Dr. Voorhees tomorrow.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.477
Isn't that the guy
we took Dewey's hamster to?

13:46.564 --> 13:47.827
He's a doctor.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.524
If he isn't
in the society pages,

13:49.611 --> 13:50.960
then you're not impressed,
huh, Lois?

13:51.047 --> 13:53.310
Go back to Trey!

13:53.397 --> 13:55.356
-We'll find the money somehow.
-No way!

13:55.443 --> 13:57.706
Well, you are going to have to
find some way to deal with this.

13:57.793 --> 13:59.534
I know and I have.

13:59.621 --> 14:01.318
I'm not an idiot, Lois.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.407
Now, please, will you
hand me my scream box?

14:08.369 --> 14:11.328
[screaming]

14:12.852 --> 14:15.071
[door slams]

14:15.158 --> 14:17.204
Hey, what's all the noise?
You know the rule.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.467
The only sound allowed
in this room is snoring.

14:19.554 --> 14:22.165
I've been waiting ten years
to see Conrad Horner perform,

14:22.252 --> 14:24.428
and I overslept
and completely missed it.

14:24.515 --> 14:26.735
Oh, he'll come back
in a few years.

14:26.822 --> 14:28.389
He's 98.

14:28.476 --> 14:30.086
I got there in time
to get a program off the floor

14:30.173 --> 14:31.783
and see his ambulance
drive away.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.089
Oh, well.

14:33.176 --> 14:34.743
You know what would help?

14:34.830 --> 14:36.310
Sleep.

14:36.397 --> 14:39.530
I actually dreamed
I was in this bed sleeping.

14:39.617 --> 14:41.228
Sleep is all we ever do anymore.

14:41.315 --> 14:42.882
Do you even know what day it is?

14:42.969 --> 14:45.058
I don't even know
what year it is.

14:45.145 --> 14:46.146
Get up!

14:46.233 --> 14:47.669
Don't you have
a test tomorrow?

14:47.756 --> 14:50.454
It could affect college,
your future!

14:50.541 --> 14:52.108
I'm pursuing my dreams
right here

14:52.195 --> 14:54.371
in a much more direct way.

14:54.458 --> 14:55.807
Well, I'm done with it.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.332
Fine!
More room for me.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.203
So that's your plan?

15:00.290 --> 15:02.118
You're going to sleep
for the rest of your life?

15:02.205 --> 15:03.337
That's pretty pathetic.

15:03.424 --> 15:05.121
I'll leave my mark.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.254
Long after I'm gone,
the memory coils

15:07.341 --> 15:10.126
in this bed will still remember
the contours of my body.

15:10.213 --> 15:12.085
Listen to yourself.
That's insane.

15:12.172 --> 15:13.216
This bed is evil.

15:13.303 --> 15:15.740
It's draining your soul,
Malcolm!

15:15.827 --> 15:19.135
[snoring]

15:19.222 --> 15:20.571
Malcolm?

15:20.658 --> 15:23.052
Okay, Mom, I think today
we might break

15:23.139 --> 15:24.619
the 12-inch distance record
we set yesterday.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.534
It's white-knuckle time.

15:26.621 --> 15:28.840
I'm not doing this anymore.

15:28.928 --> 15:29.798
What?!

15:29.885 --> 15:31.234
You know I can't do it.

15:31.321 --> 15:32.714
I just cannot get
on that bike again.

15:32.801 --> 15:35.586
It's just too hard. Ugh.

15:35.673 --> 15:37.893
Oh, it's too hard?

15:37.980 --> 15:41.027
Well, why didn't you say so?

15:41.114 --> 15:42.550
When things get tough,
you got

15:42.637 --> 15:43.986
to just give up
and run away from your dreams.

15:44.073 --> 15:46.119
Lower your expectations.
That's fine.

15:46.206 --> 15:47.772
I've had my fun.

15:47.859 --> 15:49.731
If you want to quit,
go ahead and quit.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.167
All right, Reese,
you made your point.

15:51.254 --> 15:53.561
Let's give it a try.

15:53.648 --> 15:56.738
No, I was really saying quit.

15:56.825 --> 15:59.306
I want to thank Hal
for inviting us all over

15:59.393 --> 16:01.003
for a special afternoon game.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.397
I don't want to be the one
to break up the game here.

16:03.484 --> 16:05.921
I have nothing
to be ashamed of.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.792
-If you're implying--
-Gentlemen, gentlemen,

16:07.879 --> 16:10.099
no one is implying anything.

16:10.186 --> 16:12.797
All I'm saying is it's hard
keeping the game together.

16:12.884 --> 16:15.713
And despite our differences,
I think we can all agree

16:15.800 --> 16:18.325
this is nothing like
the hidden jack incident of '91.

16:18.412 --> 16:19.587
Here we go.

16:19.674 --> 16:20.849
You are damn right.
Here we go.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.198
Don't throw
around accusations.

16:22.285 --> 16:23.852
I will not be accused
of cheating.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.288
I never said you
were cheating.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.029
I said it looked like
you were cheating.

16:27.116 --> 16:28.030
That's totally different.

16:28.117 --> 16:29.379
I don't need to cheat.

16:29.466 --> 16:30.946
You're not that good
a poker player.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.426
So the card I needed
to make my straight

16:32.513 --> 16:34.776
just decided on its
own to leave the table?

16:34.863 --> 16:36.082
Guys, guys, come on.

16:36.169 --> 16:38.040
I'm just saying
we made it through that;

16:38.127 --> 16:39.389
we can make it through this.

16:39.476 --> 16:41.739
I have a feeling
by the end of this game,

16:41.826 --> 16:43.437
the problem will be solved.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.047
Show 'em.

16:45.134 --> 16:47.136
Pair of twos.

16:47.223 --> 16:48.094
Beats me.

16:48.181 --> 16:49.399
Me, too.

16:49.486 --> 16:50.792
Pair of two's the winner.

16:50.879 --> 16:53.403
Wow, I win again?

16:53.490 --> 16:55.318
Oh, I must be
on a real lucky streak.

16:55.405 --> 16:58.017
I must have
a thousand dollars here.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.236
Wait a minute.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.588
Oh, dead hand.
Cards over.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.592
You had a flush! Look!

17:08.679 --> 17:11.160
-You're letting me win!
-You are?

17:11.247 --> 17:13.031
We're just trying
to get this thing settled.

17:13.118 --> 17:15.382
I don't want your money
if I didn't win it.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.559
I have no need for your pity!

17:18.646 --> 17:20.126
I can't stand it anymore!

17:20.213 --> 17:21.823
I'll give you the dental work
for free. Happy?

17:21.910 --> 17:23.259
Let's go right down

17:23.346 --> 17:25.608
to my office right now
and put back that crown.

17:25.695 --> 17:26.784
-It's settled.
-No!

17:26.871 --> 17:28.786
I am not some charity case,

17:28.873 --> 17:31.920
and I am not going to relieve
you of your conscience, either.

17:32.007 --> 17:33.269
-Hal!
-No!

17:33.356 --> 17:34.923
You will be the one

17:35.010 --> 17:37.404
to have to live with
the pain, not me!

17:37.491 --> 17:38.622
Give me that glass of ice water!

17:38.709 --> 17:40.059
MEN: No! Don't!

17:40.972 --> 17:44.150
I hope you're happy!

17:46.195 --> 17:47.979
[screams]

17:48.067 --> 17:51.461
MEN:
Hal! Hal!

17:51.548 --> 17:53.202
[groans]

17:53.289 --> 17:56.466
My back's killing me.

17:56.553 --> 17:58.555
What happened?

17:58.642 --> 18:00.731
Malcolm, you're awake.

18:00.818 --> 18:02.994
We were worried about
you for a while.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.692
What happened
to the new mattress?

18:04.779 --> 18:06.433
What are you talking about?

18:06.520 --> 18:08.348
The mattress!

18:08.435 --> 18:10.089
I know there was a mattress.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.699
Maybe it was a dream.

18:11.786 --> 18:13.004
It wasn't a dream!

18:13.092 --> 18:14.745
The mattress
was perfect and white,

18:14.832 --> 18:16.530
and it felt like a cloud!

18:16.617 --> 18:19.141
It fell out of the sky,
and it made me happy!

18:19.228 --> 18:20.925
Was it just a bed,

18:21.012 --> 18:23.493
or was there
a beanstalk, too?

18:27.628 --> 18:29.673
Maybe it was a dream.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.545
You were happy, Malcolm.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.938
Of course it was a dream.

18:38.421 --> 18:39.727
Okay, Mom, this is it.

18:39.814 --> 18:41.729
Once you're up,
don't look down.

18:41.816 --> 18:43.034
-But...
-Trust me.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.732
Just start pedaling.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.386
I'm gonna make sure
you get through this.

18:46.473 --> 18:47.865
You are not alone.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.519
[sighs]
Thank you, Reese.

18:49.606 --> 18:50.520
Now go!

18:57.353 --> 18:58.833
[sighs]

19:09.322 --> 19:10.236
[chuckling]

19:10.323 --> 19:11.541
Oh, my God!

19:11.628 --> 19:13.674
I'm doing it!

19:13.761 --> 19:16.198
I'm riding!

19:17.808 --> 19:19.549
Don't worry, Mom!

19:20.637 --> 19:22.073
Reese?

19:22.161 --> 19:23.727
Try to go slow, Mom!

19:23.814 --> 19:25.512
I'm going to crash into you!

19:25.599 --> 19:26.817
I'm going to prove

19:26.904 --> 19:28.689
to you that falling
isn't so bad!

19:28.776 --> 19:31.953
No, Reese, I'm doing fine, see?

19:32.040 --> 19:33.955
Mom, it's the only way!

19:54.889 --> 19:56.543
Reese, it worked!

19:56.630 --> 19:58.632
I'm not afraid.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.373
I can ride.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.375
Thank you.

20:02.462 --> 20:04.725
[groaning]
Mommy...

20:04.812 --> 20:07.815
[siren bloops,
chatter on police radio]

20:16.693 --> 20:18.391
[grunting, mumbling]

20:18.478 --> 20:22.612
So... want to tell me
what's going on here?

20:22.699 --> 20:23.744
It's cool, Officer.

20:23.831 --> 20:25.006
You see, we tied him up

20:25.093 --> 20:26.877
because he's got
a painful, busted tooth,

20:26.964 --> 20:28.531
and he refused to let us fix it.

20:28.618 --> 20:30.620
[Hal mumbling]

20:37.801 --> 20:39.716
Okay. Drive safe.

20:39.803 --> 20:42.153
-[shrieking]
-Thanks.
