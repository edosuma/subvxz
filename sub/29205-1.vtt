mention that the service

You should pay for
your wedding yourself.

crowdfunding that made it

05:11.045 --> 05:13.478

Mia really nailed
the cross-promotion.

few wedding prep things

05:51.585 --> 05:54.119

the outdoorsy bachelorette fun.

girls' night in the city, honey.

that sounds really great.

gonna get some lunch.

06:57.818 --> 07:00.652

Well, I'm sorry,
I know you said everything

07:44.164 --> 07:45.897
would be gluten free,
but since you don't have

07:45.899 --> 07:48.934
a gluten-free kitchen, I
didn't want to take any chances.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.470
All this is supposed
to be accomplished today?

07:51.472 --> 07:53.605
No, no, just the Friday to do.

07:53.607 --> 07:57.175
Yeah, I'm
referring to the Friday to do.
It's really not that much.

07:57.177 --> 08:01.079
I mean, we just have
to get the playhouse ready
for the talent show.

-And then we need to get
the cabins done for the guests.
-[bird cawing]

And then we're gonna
come back here,

we're gonna arrange some
tables, throw up some lights,

08:08.522 --> 08:10.589
and we're going
to have so much fun.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.825
Oh, I almost forgot,
we have butterfly nets

08:13.827 --> 08:16.928
so like if you
happen to be prepping
and you find a butterfly,

08:16.930 --> 08:18.697
'cause we're going to have
a butterfly release.

Guys, this is how weddings work.

I mean, we didn't
have to throw her a shower
or a bachelorette party.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.949
And she let us pick out
whatever dress we wanted.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.951
-Hmm, as long as it was pink.

be just as ridiculous

-about helping us
with our weddings.
-We eloped.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.026

them up with Paulette?

No. I was just getting
this one wrapped up

09:17.991 --> 09:20.959
and then I was going to
go over to the next one
and get going.

other cabins are done.

11:39.266 --> 11:42.133
Sorry, just got a weird text
message. I'm just gonna have
to find service.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.802
Okay, but if you see
any pretty wildflowers,

11:43.804 --> 11:44.969
can you bring them
and then you--

11:44.971 --> 11:47.939
[doors clattering]

11:49.342 --> 11:50.208
[Mia sighs]

11:50.210 --> 11:51.309
Dom.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.244
Dom.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.346
[grunts] 13.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.849
Oh hey, oh it was 14.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.718
How are the cabins going?

11:59.720 --> 12:02.020
Yeah, actually I'm all done.
We going to canoe?

12:02.022 --> 12:05.924
Yeah. So maybe you could
help Eileen with her cabin

12:05.926 --> 12:06.925
'cause she's falling behind.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.393
Okay, and you're going to--

12:08.395 --> 12:12.063
I got to do high
intensity interval training

12:13.900 --> 12:16.968
every three hours
to reduce water weight

12:18.004 --> 12:19.804
and flush my skin.

12:19.806 --> 12:22.440
[birds chirping]

12:22.442 --> 12:23.408
Paulette?

12:23.410 --> 12:26.211
[ominous music]

12:37.290 --> 12:38.857
Text Scott.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.959
Walnuts, exclamation point.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.094
Is Jefferson all right,
question mark.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.530
Fucking text me back, period.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.199
[bird cawing]

12:49.436 --> 12:50.435
Call Scott.

12:52.038 --> 12:56.875
-[eerie music]
-[wind howling]

12:56.877 --> 12:57.809
[phone ringing]

12:57.811 --> 13:00.078
[phone buzzing]

13:00.080 --> 13:03.014
[branch cracking]

13:13.126 --> 13:14.058
[message alert beeping]

13:14.161 --> 13:17.061
[suspenseful music]

13:21.067 --> 13:23.234
[tinkling music]

13:23.236 --> 13:24.335
-We'll catch up tomorrow.
-[Mia sighs]

13:26.006 --> 13:28.439
-Are you sure
your text went through?
-Yeah, I am.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.975
Are you sure nobody's
seen Flynn since before dinner?

13:30.977 --> 13:33.311
Maybe she's looking
for a gluten-free kitchen.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.579
[Gore chuckles]

13:34.915 --> 13:37.182
You guys, she gets really sick.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.417
That's why I got
gluten-free everything.

13:39.419 --> 13:42.086
Wait,
these are gluten-free s'mores?

13:42.088 --> 13:44.022
[ominous music]

13:44.024 --> 13:45.223
Oh, Jesus!

13:45.225 --> 13:46.424
Oh thank God.

13:46.426 --> 13:49.160
I need to use the van to get
somewhere with service, okay?

13:49.162 --> 13:51.896
Scott has Jefferson's
nut allergies confused.

13:51.898 --> 13:53.064
Is he okay?

13:53.066 --> 13:54.299
Scott's not getting back to me

13:54.301 --> 13:56.301
and I'm supposed
to call him at bedtime

13:56.303 --> 13:59.270
and I've never
been away from him.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.207
I'm just the
only designated driver

14:02.209 --> 14:04.609
and I just got Lasik so I'm
not allowed to drive at night

14:04.611 --> 14:08.479
for like a month and,
but if you need to make a call--

14:08.481 --> 14:10.081
You got Lasik?

14:10.083 --> 14:12.016
Yeah. Dalvero got it
for me as a surprise

14:12.018 --> 14:14.319
so I can go
water skiing in Cancun.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.387
-[all] Oh.
-[Flynn sighs]

14:16.389 --> 14:18.623
You could walk to Bufflehorn.

14:18.625 --> 14:23.094
It's just 7.8 miles.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.229
[grunts] Fuck it.

14:24.231 --> 14:25.430
It's your weekend.

14:26.266 --> 14:29.500
He'll be fine.
I just need to trust.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.636
Are you going to be okay?
Did you get dinner?

14:31.638 --> 14:33.938
I had some flax chips.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.874
Oh my God, you must be starving.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.611
The s'mores are gluten-free.

14:39.946 --> 14:41.145
Yeah, they're
right out of the package.

14:41.147 --> 14:43.982
They weren't in my kitchen,
just here.

14:44.618 --> 14:47.886
Take mine. It's not part of
the Bride Boheme Cleanse.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.957
Now that we're all here,

14:52.959 --> 14:55.193
maybe a little sneak
peak into the talent show?

14:59.132 --> 15:02.600
[animals warbling eerily]

15:08.441 --> 15:13.278
Summer 1985, Camp Pocumtuck.

15:14.281 --> 15:17.115
A picture of youthful innocence

15:17.117 --> 15:19.984
until it is deflowered by death!

15:20.320 --> 15:23.688
Wait, are you part
of the talent show?

15:24.157 --> 15:25.390
Yeah.

15:25.392 --> 15:28.293
Ghost story, summer camp.

15:28.295 --> 15:30.395
-Too tropey?
-Yeah.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.964
But it's true.
I did the research.

15:32.966 --> 15:35.466
As did I. It was
a social experiment gone awry.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.434
[eerie music]

15:36.937 --> 15:38.136
That's pretty obvious.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.405
But did you know
that the girl drowned

15:40.407 --> 15:42.307
because she was
struck by lightning?

15:42.309 --> 15:44.309
-[air whooshing]
-Odd.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.610
Wait, what are they
talking about?

15:45.612 --> 15:47.979
There was just
some unrest in the '80s.

15:47.981 --> 15:49.681
A camper drowned,
it was an accident.

15:49.683 --> 15:52.550
And honestly,
in the history of a camp,

15:52.552 --> 15:54.719
one death, it's kind of amazing.

15:55.355 --> 15:58.623
This is also the
location of an Indian massacre.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.691
[dramatic ominous music]

15:59.693 --> 16:02.427
And there were some
witch trials up the road.

16:02.429 --> 16:03.594
-[dramatic ominous music]
-[woman screaming]

16:03.596 --> 16:07.966
Nothing Salem level
but some girls got immolated.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.500
[fire snapping]

16:09.502 --> 16:12.704
Wait, is someone else
doing horror spoken word?

16:13.306 --> 16:14.973
No, they're not
but I think maybe

16:15.108 --> 16:17.075
you should try something
else a little less maudlin.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.676
Like what did
you decide to sing?

16:20.580 --> 16:23.214
[clears throat]
"Battle Hymn of the Republic."

16:25.185 --> 16:27.051
What, you said it
had to be rights free

16:27.053 --> 16:29.053
because of Bride Boheme
taking video

16:29.055 --> 16:31.656
but it's difficult to
find public domain songs

16:31.658 --> 16:34.459
and have time to rehearse
when you're a mom, okay?

16:35.195 --> 16:40.064
And I just sang it
for Jefferson's 1776 party.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.634
Why don't you guys
sing that together?

16:47.040 --> 16:49.774
[crunching]

16:51.611 --> 16:54.645
Are these handmade marshmallows?

16:54.647 --> 16:56.547
Yeah, they're from that
great little place in my hood.

16:56.549 --> 16:57.782
All marshmallows
are gluten-free.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.318
-I checked.
-[spits] No!

17:00.453 --> 17:03.521
All mass-produced ones are
but some of the handmade ones

17:03.523 --> 17:05.356
use flour in the process.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.424
[spitting]

17:06.426 --> 17:11.229
Oh my God! [spitting]

17:11.231 --> 17:13.331
-Oh my God!
-What the fuck is that?

17:13.333 --> 17:14.399
Vodka.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.635
Wheat or potato-based?

17:17.637 --> 17:18.703
Cheap.

17:21.641 --> 17:22.573
It's okay.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.778
I'll know in a couple of hours.

17:26.780 --> 17:29.313
[tense music]

17:29.816 --> 17:31.516
-Another one.
-Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.184
No green piles still?

17:33.653 --> 17:36.554
-Flynn!
-Oh shit, my tolerance is gone.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.557
Guys, help me drink
all this gluten-free beer
so it's a fair fight.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.658
Oh, got enough of this.

17:40.660 --> 17:41.793
[Mia] Bride Boheme Cleanse.

17:41.795 --> 17:43.261
-I'm okay.
-[bottles clanking]

17:43.263 --> 17:44.495
You're refusing alcohol?

17:44.497 --> 17:45.363

17:48.468 --> 17:49.801
-Flick fly.
-Oh, fuck!

17:49.803 --> 17:52.236
Ah ha ha ha ha.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.305
[Alexis] Should we see if Eileen
and Paulette want to play?

17:54.607 --> 17:57.208
Can we discuss
Eileen and Paulette?

17:57.210 --> 17:58.609
Yeah. I know Paulette's

17:58.611 --> 18:01.379
Dalvero's weird
college friend but Eileen.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.283
I accidentally invited Eileen.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.085

Are you guys
getting baby pressure yet?

Yeah, ever since
we announced the date.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.376
Fuckety fuck fuck!

19:05.378 --> 19:07.445
But, you know, it's just
for the taxes in other words.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.914
[sputters] Everything changes.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.282
Shit!

19:11.284 --> 19:12.350
It's like a mortgage.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.185
You sure he's a safe investment?

19:15.155 --> 19:16.454
Yeah,
what does that mean, Alexis?

19:16.456 --> 19:18.689
-Blitz.

her have that fantasy?

She thought you two were
having a fren-a-ssance.

19:48.588 --> 19:51.355

the poor girl off the hook.

I mean, if anybody was

20:06.272 --> 20:07.805
[Alexis] You guys, blitz pile.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.907
There are these guys
with these scary fucking masks

-Couldn't they just
be other Airbnb renters?
-No, I booked the whole camp.

20:19.586 --> 20:22.520
I guess the escaped
convicts that are going to rape

20:22.522 --> 20:25.723
and murder us didn't book
their crime scene on Airbnb.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.826
Were the strippers not a joke?

20:28.828 --> 20:30.428
Oh, you would've killed me.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.463
You hate all
flavors of exploitation.

-Yeah, I'm sorry, boo.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.271
You were
supposed to come tomorrow.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.538
My fault,
I had Jack drive us up.

21:14.540 --> 21:15.806
Dalvero didn't even know.

21:16.709 --> 21:17.975
Yeah, well he knew
he was wearing a mask

21:19.479 --> 21:20.461
to scare the shit out of us.

21:20.462 --> 21:21.444
It was really
poor judgment on our part.

21:21.447 --> 21:23.814
But this way we can
help you first thing tomorrow.

21:23.816 --> 21:24.815
Hey.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.318
Oh, hey, you made it.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.052
Shocked?

21:29.622 --> 21:31.555
I'm Trask, groomsman.

21:31.557 --> 21:34.292
Sorry if you all
thought I was a murderer.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.661
This is Jack,
best man, designated driver.

21:37.697 --> 21:39.830
And you all know Dalvero.

21:39.832 --> 21:42.433
Uh, sorry to
psychologically molest you all.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.769
Hi, I'm Eileen.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.404
I'm not supposed to be here

21:46.406 --> 21:47.772
but I'm just going with it.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.677
Okay, I think we
should all just go to bed

21:52.679 --> 21:54.745
because we have a
very big day tomorrow.

21:54.747 --> 21:58.082
-The big day, boo.
-[Mia chuckles]

22:01.020 --> 22:02.019
Sweet dreams.

22:06.459 --> 22:07.658
[Dalvero] Come on, Jack.

22:11.831 --> 22:15.800
-Oh, mother of God.
-Who is Trask?

22:15.802 --> 22:17.802
He's one of
Dalvero's douchey work friends.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.637
He's really not that sexy.

22:19.639 --> 22:22.039
Bride blindness,
he's everything.

22:22.041 --> 22:23.607
Okay, lights out, all right?

22:23.609 --> 22:25.409
We kind of got a
lot to do tomorrow.

22:25.411 --> 22:27.945
-He's kind of too much.
-No such thing.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.847
Mia, what team?

22:29.849 --> 22:31.716
[sputtering] Straight
guys don't look like that.

22:31.718 --> 22:35.386
Oh, Flynn, welcome to
the decade of CrossFit.

22:35.388 --> 22:36.787
I'll take one for the team

22:36.789 --> 22:39.724
and propose some
inter-camper liaisons.

22:39.726 --> 22:40.858
[Flynn giggling]

22:40.860 --> 22:42.660
Dalvero mentioned he had a wife.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.362
He could be bi.

22:44.364 --> 22:49.066
-And polyamorous.

I don't really want to know how
long so please don't tell me.

1:00:58.756 --> 1:01:00.188
Yeah, your house
got hit by heat lightning

1:01:00.190 --> 1:01:04.059
and your alarm got reset.

1:01:04.061 --> 1:01:06.361

that I went the next day

1:01:06.363 --> 1:01:07.295

1:01:08.032 --> 1:01:11.199
We only got 1 1/4 stars.

1:01:11.201 --> 1:01:14.336

Disney Channel Japan contract.

Because you are certainly
not an officer of the law.

from the vehicle

1:20:57.587 --> 1:20:59.286
has to approve it.

1:21:00.456 --> 1:21:03.490
We need to open up
a channel to her spirit

1:21:03.492 --> 1:21:05.326
and then call
the camp director--

1:21:05.328 --> 1:21:07.494
But the camp
director is in prison

1:21:07.496 --> 1:21:09.230
according to the website.

1:21:09.465 --> 1:21:13.901
Well, all that matters
is that she believes it.

1:21:13.903 --> 1:21:16.337
One of us can pretend
we're the camp director

1:21:16.339 --> 1:21:18.606
and let her know
she's off the hook.

1:21:18.608 --> 1:21:20.507
Or we could pretend to be God

1:21:20.509 --> 1:21:22.409
and tell her to go to hell.

1:21:22.411 --> 1:21:24.545
How hard is it
to open a channel?

1:21:25.414 --> 1:21:27.948

1:21:37.994 --> 1:21:39.493
Where are we going
to source all this stuff?

1:21:39.495 --> 1:21:41.195
We can improvise.

1:21:41.197 --> 1:21:44.064
In the spirit realm,
it's the thought that counts.

1:21:44.066 --> 1:21:45.933

fade from my life

It was undergrad

and I didn't tell him and
he freaked out midway through

so defining it as full-stop
sex is like a stretch, okay?

1:29:34.403 --> 1:29:37.003

Uh, I didn't send the stay
away from the wedding email.

1:31:07.663 --> 1:31:11.665
Seriously? Do you just want
your friends and family
to show up to this shit storm

1:31:11.667 --> 1:31:14.167
in case we pull off an
eight-way exorcism. Oh my God.

1:31:14.169 --> 1:31:16.937
So this isn't
just my wedding, okay?

1:31:19.107 --> 1:31:21.942
It's an audition for a
wedding-planning position
at Bride Boheme.

1:31:23.645 --> 1:31:27.080
My opera career is over.
Okay, fine,
it never even started.

1:31:27.082 --> 1:31:29.783
I just started lying
about it on social media but...

1:31:32.120 --> 1:31:34.120
I have to do
something with my life.

1:31:35.190 --> 1:31:37.123
I can't just be somebody's wife.

1:31:39.962 --> 1:31:40.894
Wow.

1:31:59.648 --> 1:32:00.580
No, no, no.
