00:01.869 --> 00:03.271
This picture is an assault

00:03.371 --> 00:05.073
on Italian Americans
everywhere.

00:05.173 --> 00:07.108
If I have my way, you won't
make this movie at all.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.210
"The Godfather"
is becoming a problem.

00:09.310 --> 00:10.378
We wanna give you
some help.

00:10.478 --> 00:11.512
No.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.081
One more thing.
Pacino.

00:13.181 --> 00:15.083
Give him another shot.
No Pacino.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.251
How many fucking times
do I have to tell you?

00:17.351 --> 00:19.387
I got a script
the size of an encyclopedia,

00:19.487 --> 00:21.189
a director in love with
the shortest unknown actor

00:21.289 --> 00:22.490
on the fucking planet,

00:22.590 --> 00:24.192
and Biaggi's making waves.

00:24.292 --> 00:25.393
Am I forgetting anything?

00:25.493 --> 00:26.694
No.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.529
I'm pretty sure that covers it.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.798
Joe Gallo's actions
led to our last war.

00:30.898 --> 00:33.134
If Gallo comes gunning
for Colombo,

00:33.234 --> 00:34.735
you get caught
with a stray bullet.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.470
What do you got
in mind for him?

00:36.570 --> 00:38.806
I'm gonna light his whole
fucking world on fire.

00:38.906 --> 00:41.375
It's you and me now.
Your enemies are my enemies.

00:41.475 --> 00:44.445
Please,
I don't want no trouble.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.614
The Marlon Brando's house.

00:46.714 --> 00:49.450
Ever since your letter,
I keep thinking about the Don.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.752
Pacino and Brando
in the same frame.

00:51.852 --> 00:52.653
I'm working on it.

00:52.753 --> 00:55.156
Side with Francis.
Pacino's the guy.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.790
Evans gave you your shot.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.692
If I say yes,
he's gonna be pissed.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.262
You stabbed me in the back.
I don't like Pacino!

01:01.362 --> 01:02.696
I want to be with you.

01:02.796 --> 01:05.166
All of you or none of you.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.734
This is the life
that we've chosen.

01:06.834 --> 01:10.471
We can only be around other
people who understand that.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.106
You got the part, kid.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.741
I'm doing "The Gang That
Couldn't Shoot Straight."

01:13.841 --> 01:15.476
I signed a contract.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.168
What are you doing?
Come on.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.869
I like this song.
No.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.103
You're sending
the wrong message, kid.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.438
What fucking message?

01:45.806 --> 01:47.107
Here we go.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.143
That's good, no?

01:49.243 --> 01:50.511
Whatever, old man,
I like this too.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.580
Ah, fuck you
with the "old man."

01:56.484 --> 01:57.685
Would you look at this jamoke?

01:57.785 --> 02:00.621
The fuck?

02:00.721 --> 02:01.689
Fuck that.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.892
Come on!

02:04.992 --> 02:07.361
What the fuck is he doin'?

02:12.400 --> 02:14.168
Hey, buddy, you gotta move
this fuckin' car

02:14.268 --> 02:15.703
before I move it for you.

02:15.803 --> 02:16.837
Fuck.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.412
Let him go.

02:27.281 --> 02:28.482
What do you think's
in the truck?

02:28.582 --> 02:30.418
Don't matter.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.969
What the fuck
are you doing here?

04:29.069 --> 04:30.738
Oh, my God,
you smell like a sick dog.

04:30.838 --> 04:31.805
What the fuck?

04:31.905 --> 04:33.941
I just got off a plane.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.376
I need your help.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.744
Boy, did you come
to the wrong place.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.380
You told me to do whatever
it takes to get my movie made.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.848
You said to color
outside the lines.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.951
I never told you
to fuck me over.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.486
That was never
my intention, Bob.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.321
Yeah,
and Yoko Ono never intended

04:47.421 --> 04:48.589
to break up The Beatles.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.924
I don't give a fuck
about your intentions.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.560
It was for the movie.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.395
It was for the good
of the movie.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.864
Keep saying that to yourself.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.300
Listen.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.335
Pacino can't do the film.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.003
He signed on
to another project.

05:03.103 --> 05:04.872
Problem solved then.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.675
I need you
to get him out of it.

05:09.543 --> 05:12.680
You have got to be
fucking kidding me.

05:12.780 --> 05:13.914
Come on, Bob.

05:14.014 --> 05:14.882
You've never even
given him a shot.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.049
He's got something special.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.351
We need him.

05:17.451 --> 05:20.488
What you need
is a fucking shower.

05:20.588 --> 05:21.755
Mush.

05:24.124 --> 05:27.361
Now, Paramount is just
one asset among dozens

05:27.461 --> 05:29.430
in the Gulf and Western
portfolio.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.632
Now, by God's grace,

05:31.732 --> 05:34.101
we have a record-breaking hit
called "Love Story,"

05:34.201 --> 05:36.437
but I won't pretend
that we knew

05:36.537 --> 05:38.071
it was gonna hit like this.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.774
And that is actually my point.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.511
Making movies has become
too unpredictable.

05:43.611 --> 05:46.480
Hollywood was founded by men
who understood

05:46.580 --> 05:48.849
that the bottom line
of making movies

05:48.949 --> 05:51.552
is to make money.

05:51.652 --> 05:54.822
But gentlemen,
that system is broken.

05:54.922 --> 05:58.426
The men with their hands
on the wheel now,

05:58.526 --> 06:00.661
they are, quite frankly,
bullshit artists

06:00.761 --> 06:03.964
who like to think of themselves
as the talent.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.733
They know exactly
what to say to us

06:05.833 --> 06:06.834
to get our money,

06:07.801 --> 06:08.969
but they can give a damn
about making it back

06:09.069 --> 06:12.406
because
they are not businessmen.

06:12.506 --> 06:15.108
Now that we have finally
had some success,

06:15.208 --> 06:16.677
we can get a much better price

06:16.777 --> 06:19.880
if we offload Paramount now
and cash out.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.149
So that's why we're here today.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.585
We are here to seek
the board's approval

06:24.685 --> 06:28.756
to begin the exploration
process because

06:28.856 --> 06:32.893
we have already
had four suitors interested.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.864
Charlie, anything to add?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.668
Some of you think that

06:40.768 --> 06:43.837
I have a sentimental attachment
to Paramount.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.540
I have a sentimental attachment
to many things,

06:46.640 --> 06:50.478
which is why when I sell them,

06:50.578 --> 06:53.547
I sell them for a lot of money.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.961
Tessio, he's gotta be older.

07:08.061 --> 07:11.965
He--he's like the oldest guy
in the whole family.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.433
So what you're saying
is you want Clemenza to be

07:13.534 --> 07:15.469
two or three years younger?

07:15.569 --> 07:18.839
Yeah, that'd be good.
You got anybody in mind?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.974
Hello.
Hi.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.543
Where's Ruddy?

07:22.643 --> 07:23.711
He's on his way back from LA.

07:23.811 --> 07:26.980
His flight lands later tonight.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.650
Why's he in LA?

07:29.750 --> 07:31.619
Doesn't he realize
that the producer

07:31.719 --> 07:33.754
is supposed to be here
for pre-production?

07:33.854 --> 07:37.024
We have a sit-down
with Tavoularis and Gordy.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.158
Did you tell him?

07:38.258 --> 07:39.693
I was waiting
until Ruddy got back.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.194
Tell me what?
What is wrong?

07:41.294 --> 07:43.864
Pacino signed a contract
for another movie.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.770
Come on, Francis.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.706
Jimmy Caan's screen test
was good and you know it.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.207
We just set him for Sonny.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.877
And now you want me
to just make him Michael?

07:56.977 --> 07:59.212
Francis, you know this shit
happens all the time.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.082
Andrea,
this isn't musical chairs.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.251
Caan is not even Italian.
Okay.

08:04.351 --> 08:07.521
You're making a movie
with Marlon Brando.

08:07.621 --> 08:10.257
And don't worry,
we'll find another Michael.

08:10.357 --> 08:11.959
Will he just look
at Pacino?

08:19.132 --> 08:20.868
Roll it back, would you?

08:20.968 --> 08:22.903
Again?

08:23.003 --> 08:25.673
How many times do we have to
watch "Panic in Needle Park"?

08:25.773 --> 08:27.541
There's a scene in
"The Godfather" script,

08:27.641 --> 08:28.642
Michael tells his
brother-in-law

08:28.742 --> 08:30.277
he's not gonna kill him
but we know he's lying.

08:30.377 --> 08:31.845
It's a shocking scene.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.814
But it's gotta be played
in the subtext.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.716
Pacino doesn't have
to say a word

08:35.816 --> 08:37.951
and I can't take
my eyes off him.

08:39.687 --> 08:43.256
"An ice-blue, terrifying film

08:43.356 --> 08:46.894
about people you love."

08:46.994 --> 08:49.597
Fuckin' Ruddy.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.635
Hi.
Hey, Bettye.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.036
Ooh, you smell nice.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.537
Fancy hotel, fancy soap.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.206
Gotta love the Waldorf.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.642
How'd it go with Evans?
What did he say?

09:01.742 --> 09:02.643
He said,
"Do whatever it takes

09:02.743 --> 09:05.178
to get your movie made, Ruddy.
I support you."

09:05.278 --> 09:07.948
So not well, I take it.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.917
Have you--

09:10.017 --> 09:11.652
have you seen this?

09:13.120 --> 09:14.888
It's Carmine.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.224
Fuck.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.727
I liked that guy.

09:19.827 --> 09:22.062
Al, this is really scary.

09:23.664 --> 09:24.732
We're gonna be okay.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.072
You got any good news for me?

09:32.172 --> 09:34.608
Well, your buddy Jack Ballard

09:34.708 --> 09:37.177
is waiting for you
in your office.

09:37.277 --> 09:38.979
Shit.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.614
You and I are gonna
need to have a little chat

09:40.714 --> 09:42.683
about what exactly
constitutes good news.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.120
Just the man I want to see.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.856
Jack,
what are you doing here?

09:48.956 --> 09:52.092
Anything you need,
Mr. Producer.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.828
Have you met our editor?
Aram Avakian, Al Ruddy.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.964
Aram, I thought you weren't
getting in until tomorrow.

09:57.064 --> 09:58.065
Uh, Jack called me.

09:59.032 --> 10:00.200
He wanted to get acquainted
a day earlier.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.602
Oh, did he?
Mm.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.872
Glad to be aboard.
Glad to have you.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.606
Jack, did you see
"The Miracle Worker"?

10:06.707 --> 10:08.075
Nah, missed it.
Aram cut it.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.142
It's beautiful work.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.744
Mm, thank you.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.613
Al's gonna need a miracle
to bring us in on budget.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.082
Aram, tell you what.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.717
We'll have a drink,
take each other's temperature,

10:16.817 --> 10:18.618
and solve the world's problems.
Sounds good to me.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.320
Where and when?
Count me in.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.822
For the second round, Jack.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.190
I like to meet the team
on my own first.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.925
Oh, sorry.
I wasn't sure about that

10:25.025 --> 10:26.626
since you missed the meeting
with your production designer

10:26.727 --> 10:29.062
and cinematographer
this morning.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.668
Looking forward to that drink.

10:34.768 --> 10:35.936
Charlie.

10:42.309 --> 10:46.346
why is Jim Aubrey
seated at my regular my booth?

10:46.446 --> 10:48.215
I'm so sorry, Mr. Evans.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.649
Mr. Aubrey got here early.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.852
He insisted on sitting
at his usual table.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.987
Aubrey runs MGM.
I run Paramount.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.756
MGM just had an auction
to sell off

10:55.856 --> 10:57.257
props and costumes
to pay the mortgage.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.658
Come on.

10:58.759 --> 10:59.526
How long has he been here?

10:59.626 --> 11:01.829
About six minutes.
Son of a bitch.

11:01.929 --> 11:05.098
You couldn't stall him for
six minutes until I got here?

11:05.198 --> 11:08.068
Coffee.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.269
Please.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.406
Terry, looking good.
You lost weight?

11:13.506 --> 11:15.275
Hi, Bob.
How are you?

11:15.375 --> 11:16.343
Anabelle.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.978
Hi, Bob.
Hi, dear.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.713
Nice to see you.
Catch up later.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.715
Jim, I'm so sorry I'm late.
You're still early.

11:21.815 --> 11:22.816
Well, I grew up under the rule

11:22.916 --> 11:23.851
that if you're
ten minutes early,

11:23.951 --> 11:27.387
you're still late.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.422
Hell of a job
you're doing at MGM.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.759
It's all anyone can talk about.

11:31.859 --> 11:32.893
Last year, we were in the red.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.795
This year we're seeing
nothing but black.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.730
How 'bout you?
Well, we haven't started

11:36.830 --> 11:38.932
selling our props
and furniture just yet.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.167
Nothing's too precious, huh?

11:40.267 --> 11:42.402
Not even Dorothy's
Ruby Red slippers?

11:42.502 --> 11:43.971
Thank you.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.473
So we got a small piece
of business between us.

11:46.573 --> 11:47.841
Let's make sure
we're on the same page.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.242
This is about swapping actors.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.710
It's Pacino and De Niro.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.079
Two guys starting out
their careers,

11:52.179 --> 11:53.981
getting paid scale plus ten.
Come on.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.482
You're treating them like
we're trading an outfielder

11:55.582 --> 11:57.484
for a shortstop.
Why not?

11:57.584 --> 11:58.718
It's for the good
of both movies.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.822
Each wants the other's part.
Simple.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.491
You know, you make fun
of the MGM yard sale,

12:04.591 --> 12:08.161
but I hear that Paramount's
getting spun off.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.229
The whole show.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.463
Gulf and Western
is getting tired

12:10.563 --> 12:12.299
and they want out.

12:16.970 --> 12:17.805
No.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.406
If you didn't know,
I just did you a favor

12:19.506 --> 12:23.944
and that's on top of the favor
you're here to ask me for.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.779
I think I've done
both of us a favor.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.747
You want this more than I do.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.749
Personally,
I don't see such a difference

12:29.850 --> 12:31.251
between Pacino and De Niro.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.753
De Niro does "The Gang
That Couldn't Shoot Straight."

12:33.854 --> 12:36.289
Pacino does "The Godfather."
Everybody wins.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.026
Pass.
What else?

12:41.028 --> 12:43.763
You have a couple of
Harold Robbins' books I want.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.298
Can't do it.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.200
Then we don't have a deal.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.843
One book.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.311
One book, my choice.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.392
Wow.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.427
That had to hurt.

13:14.527 --> 13:19.032
You sure this is
really worth it?

13:19.132 --> 13:20.901
You know, I'm a production
designer, not a magician.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.435
Dean, what's the problem?

13:22.535 --> 13:24.004
Well, having permits
to build sets

13:24.104 --> 13:26.339
where I'm supposed to
build them would be nice.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.175
We have permits.
They got pulled.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.844
Some congressmen
is fucking with us.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.013
Look, this should have been
handled a long time ago.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.182
Take it easy, okay?
It's a misunderstanding.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.517
Bettye, call that kid
in the film office I talked to.

13:37.617 --> 13:40.287
Kevin something.
Yeah.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.856
He'll sort this out.

13:44.992 --> 13:48.295
Hi, I have Al Ruddy
on the line for Kevin, please.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.933
Since when?

13:53.033 --> 13:56.336
Okay. Thank you.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.938
Kevin's been fired.

13:59.572 --> 14:02.442
Because he gave us the permits.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.478
We need to take Gallo out now.

14:05.578 --> 14:09.149
No. No, not yet.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.184
I gotta talk to Carlo
and the rest of the Commission

14:11.284 --> 14:14.621
to get the okay to rip
this motherfucker's face off.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.456
All right, in the meantime,

14:16.556 --> 14:18.358
hit the streets,
make your collections.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.626
Everybody pays today.

14:19.726 --> 14:22.595
I want 20% kickback
to Carmine's widow.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.932
FBI. Nobody move!

14:25.032 --> 14:27.567
Keep your hands
where we can see 'em.

14:27.667 --> 14:28.969
Well, this is nice.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.304
Family reunion.
You bring presents?

14:31.404 --> 14:32.906
We got warrants.
You know the drill.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.241
Okay, okay.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.509
Tear this place up.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.614
What's this?
Go fuck yourself.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.551
Teach your people
some respect.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.286
I need that.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.457
Congressman Biaggi
sends his best.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.646
Hello?
Listen to me.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.248
You're still a putz,

15:15.348 --> 15:16.916
but I got Pacino.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.452
He's in the picture.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.455
Oh, Bob, thank you.
I can't tell you how much--

15:22.555 --> 15:24.157
They can't breathe.
Huh?

15:24.257 --> 15:26.326
The leaves.
Look, they're turning brown.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.501
See? Caravaggio has the
light coming in from the top

15:34.601 --> 15:36.103
and stopping on the edges.

15:36.203 --> 15:37.437
I know. I love it.
It's beautiful.

15:37.537 --> 15:38.605
I love the shadows.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.207
It doesn't give the actors
much leeway

15:40.307 --> 15:42.309
to move around though.
That's right.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.211
Well, they have to have
freedom to move.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.079
Well, they have
to hit their marks.

15:46.179 --> 15:49.082
They need to be free to move
so we're gonna test it.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.519
Sure. Yeah, if you want.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.721
It's not an insult, Gordy,
to work all this out

15:54.821 --> 15:56.156
before we get on the set
with 100 people.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.657
You wanna test?
We'll test. It's fine.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.326
It's fine.
Good. Great.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.361
See it as an opportunity
to show off.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.130
What? Is that what you think
that I'm doing here?

16:03.230 --> 16:04.197
Uh-oh.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.133
Are Mom and Dad fighting again?

16:06.233 --> 16:07.434
Hello.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.102
Can you give us a minute
because we're working--

16:09.202 --> 16:11.704
Yeah, sure.
I just came by

16:11.804 --> 16:14.041
because I had
a little piece of news,

16:14.141 --> 16:15.975
a very small piece
of news to deliver...

16:16.076 --> 16:17.110
Ruddy, what?

16:17.210 --> 16:19.612
And I wanted to do it
in person.

16:19.712 --> 16:22.182
No. You got Pacino?

16:22.282 --> 16:23.450
You got him!

16:23.550 --> 16:25.085
Are you kidding?

16:25.185 --> 16:26.653
You did it?
How did you do it?

16:26.753 --> 16:29.222
There's a certain shade
of yellow

16:29.322 --> 16:31.158
and we're not making
this movie without it.

16:31.258 --> 16:32.192
Oh.

16:33.060 --> 16:33.460
Do I want to know
how this happened?

16:34.361 --> 16:35.062
Nothing my mother
would be embarrassed by.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.496
Okay.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.166
What's with the suit?
You--you never wear a suit.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.234
I gotta see a guy
about a thing.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.709
Hey.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.144
Oh, my God.

16:57.384 --> 17:00.387
Thank you for coming.
So good to see you.

17:02.089 --> 17:03.756
Hey.
Sorry for your loss.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.658
Thank you.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.794
He was like a brother to me.

17:07.894 --> 17:10.163
It's a fucking shame.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.463
I'm sorry about Carmine.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.667
Al.

17:54.741 --> 17:58.178
They made it so he couldn't
even have an open coffin.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.746
That way, the people
that--that love him

17:59.846 --> 18:02.815
can't say goodbye
the right way.

18:02.915 --> 18:06.353
It's just not done.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.655
You did the right thing
by coming here.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.491
I appreciate that.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.860
Well, there's an old saying.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.762
"Nobody should be invited
to a funeral

18:15.862 --> 18:18.198
and everyone should come."

18:20.767 --> 18:22.335
Carmine would've liked that.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.872
He had a great sense of humor.

18:25.972 --> 18:28.175
He was a funny motherfucker.

18:31.711 --> 18:34.113
Come on.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.449
How's the movie going?

18:36.549 --> 18:38.618
Actually, Biaggi's making
more problems for us.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.720
He pulled all the permits
from the film office.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.222
I'm taking care of it.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.491
I got my own issues
with that fuck.

18:46.326 --> 18:49.796
I'm sorry to bother you
on a day like this.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.232
It is what it is.

19:01.941 --> 19:02.709
How's your son?

19:02.809 --> 19:04.744
He's good.
He's really good.

19:04.844 --> 19:08.581
He--he's thinking
about politics.

19:08.681 --> 19:09.582
Politics?

19:09.682 --> 19:11.884
Yeah, he's a smart kid.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.454
He's smarter than me.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.389
He's lookin' for
a less complicated life.

19:16.489 --> 19:20.660
Well, what I do
is hardly uncomplicated.

19:20.760 --> 19:24.231
But I wish you and your family
only the best.

19:24.331 --> 19:28.167
Is that your way
of apologizing for the raid?

19:28.268 --> 19:31.371
The raid?

19:31.471 --> 19:33.773
Think twice about
lying to me, Congressman.

19:33.873 --> 19:37.244
The League is now
over 200,000 strong,

19:37.344 --> 19:40.280
and as we both know,
you have a campaign comin' up.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.614
I got plenty of friends

19:41.714 --> 19:44.251
who wouldn't mind taking a shot
at your seat,

19:44.351 --> 19:47.854
and with the full backing
of every member in the League,

19:47.954 --> 19:52.592
plus their big, fat
Italian families.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.861
Joe.

19:54.961 --> 19:58.531
There's been a misunderstanding
between us.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.733
Oh. Maybe.

20:00.833 --> 20:03.603
If I may,

20:03.703 --> 20:06.306
I want a clean slate.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.940
I'm listening.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.543
We're both proud
Italian Americans

20:10.643 --> 20:13.446
who want what's best
for our people.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.916
So what can I do
to heal this rift between us

20:17.016 --> 20:19.319
so we can, you know,
help each other?

20:19.419 --> 20:21.888
Stronger together, is that
the tune you're singing now?

20:21.988 --> 20:23.990
Good, good.

20:24.090 --> 20:27.660
Get the feds
off my fucking back.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.762
Consider it done.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.468
And one more thing.

20:35.568 --> 20:39.406
Film noir set in the '20s
about city politics.

20:39.506 --> 20:40.740
Bob Towne wrote it.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.509
It's called "Chinatown."

20:42.609 --> 20:44.511
I read it over the weekend,
actually, in one sitting.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.346
Is this the one with
the winning combination

20:46.446 --> 20:47.947
of incest and water rights?

20:48.047 --> 20:50.283
That's it.

20:50.383 --> 20:54.987
I'll take a look at it.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.989
Bob?
Hmm?

20:57.089 --> 20:59.959
Something going on?

21:00.059 --> 21:02.028
When I was negotiating
for Pacino,

21:02.128 --> 21:04.297
Aubrey told me

21:04.397 --> 21:05.932
that he heard that Paramount
was being spun off.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.434
You heard anything about that?

21:07.534 --> 21:10.403
No. Nothing.
Not since months ago.

21:10.503 --> 21:11.938
I thought Bluhdorn said
he'd keep you in the know.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.340
Yeah.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.808
He told me "Love Story"
had to deliver.

21:15.908 --> 21:21.280
It just passed $100 million.
I'd say that qualifies.

21:21.381 --> 21:23.282
Aubrey's just trying
to get under your skin.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.859
Ugh, it's too exposed.
It's too open.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.027
It needs to be protected.

21:35.127 --> 21:38.398
Well, maybe we can
build a wall.

21:38.498 --> 21:39.666
How much?

21:39.766 --> 21:41.501
Ballard's up my ass
about the budget, guys.

21:41.601 --> 21:45.372
Um, it's--it's--it's cheap.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.640
You know, it's Styrofoam.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.943
We just paint it
to look like stone.

21:51.043 --> 21:53.746
How tall is that wall?
Eight feet?

21:53.846 --> 21:55.748
Well, it's going to cast
a shadow in the late morning.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.350
You can light that out.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.619
Maybe, if I get the lighting
package I asked for.

21:59.719 --> 22:01.988
The--the shadows,
they help tell the story.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.390
If that's the intention.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.857
What the fuck is this?

22:04.957 --> 22:09.396
A kitchen that costs $75,000?
Is this a joke?

22:09.496 --> 22:10.697
They gotta cook.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.098
We're not opening up
a restaurant, Francis.

22:12.198 --> 22:14.367
They can pretend.

22:14.467 --> 22:17.937
All department heads
in the conference room now.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.406
No gangster film,

22:19.506 --> 22:20.940
since the beginning
of recorded history,

22:21.040 --> 22:23.576
ever needed a working kitchen.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.678
It's not just
about the cooking.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.346
This is the scene

22:27.447 --> 22:29.115
where Clemenza
is talking to Michael

22:29.215 --> 22:31.117
and he tells him
that the families

22:31.217 --> 22:32.919
have to go to war
every ten years or so.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.421
And while
he's telling them that,

22:34.521 --> 22:35.722
they just happen to be making
tomato sauce,

22:35.822 --> 22:38.491
and that's why the scene
is so important.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.827
I love this scene.
You never see anything like it

22:40.927 --> 22:42.429
in a gangster film.
It's essential.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.497
You have to see them
making the tomato sauce.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.032
It humanizes them.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.534
Remember,
it makes them relatable?

22:47.634 --> 22:49.802
If you want it so badly,
you can pay for it.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.004
Francis, is that a propane
line with special effects?

22:52.104 --> 22:53.406
It's practical gas.

22:53.506 --> 22:54.807
Propane's fine. No.

22:54.907 --> 22:56.709
Propane does not burn
like practical gas.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.110
It does now.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.612
Sorry to interrupt.

23:00.713 --> 23:01.414
I just got off the phone
with the film commission.

23:02.081 --> 23:02.615
We've got our permits back.

23:03.282 --> 23:03.783
Why was that ever in doubt?

23:04.617 --> 23:05.952
You guys meeting
about this budget?

23:06.052 --> 23:07.153
Oh, God.

23:07.253 --> 23:09.021
Yeah, we're making some cuts.
Good.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.490
Then my timing is perfect.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.492
Anna, where are we at
with costumes?

23:12.592 --> 23:14.126
Over budget.
We know, Jack.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.162
That's why we're talking it
through, buddy.

23:16.262 --> 23:17.830
There's just nothing
quality in inventory

23:17.930 --> 23:19.398
from the '40s,

23:19.499 --> 23:20.433
so we're gonna
have to do a build

23:20.533 --> 23:21.868
on most of the major players.

23:21.968 --> 23:24.604
That's at least two suits
per player per scene.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.806
And an additional 200 grand
we don't have.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.407
Well, more because
we still have to dress

23:28.508 --> 23:29.709
everyone at the wedding.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.410
What if it's a small,
intimate affair,

23:31.511 --> 23:32.779
maybe only family?

23:32.879 --> 23:33.646
Stop!

23:34.313 --> 23:34.981
It can't be a small affair.

23:35.648 --> 23:36.516
She's the daughter of the Don.

23:37.416 --> 23:37.450
There are a lot
of speaking parts.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.819
Maybe you can combine
some of them.

23:39.919 --> 23:40.920
Oh, I forgot.

23:41.821 --> 23:42.689
We're doing
an off-off-Broadway play now.

23:43.456 --> 23:44.857
Okay, look,
everybody just relax.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.794
We are still making the movie
that we all set out to make.

23:47.894 --> 23:50.663
Well, we're also still
about $2 million over budget

23:50.763 --> 23:52.832
so unless you know something,
I don't know, Mr. Producer,

23:52.932 --> 23:54.834
I suggest
you grab your scissors

23:54.934 --> 23:57.770
and start making cuts
everywhere.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.139
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.953
Hey, Al.
Got a sec?

24:14.053 --> 24:14.987
Yeah.

24:15.087 --> 24:17.624
So we've got a problem.

24:17.724 --> 24:19.859
Look, Andrea,
I just want to say I think

24:19.959 --> 24:23.596
you're doing an incredible job
casting this movie.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.865
And it's obvious to me
that Paramount,

24:25.965 --> 24:29.235
they knew what they were doing
when they hired you.

24:29.335 --> 24:31.938
Thank you.
You're welcome. It's true.

24:32.038 --> 24:34.206
And, uh, listen,

24:34.306 --> 24:35.842
about the other night.

24:35.942 --> 24:38.645
We both had a lot to drink
and I'm not--

24:38.745 --> 24:40.046
I'm not saying I was drunk.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.814
Obviously,
I knew what I was doing,

24:41.914 --> 24:44.951
but, you know,
we're working together.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.620
And for me personally, I just
got out of a relationship,

24:47.720 --> 24:50.256
so, you know,
it's probably best if we just--

24:50.356 --> 24:52.191
Al, stop.

24:52.291 --> 24:53.526
That's not the problem

24:53.626 --> 24:55.061
I was talking about.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.563
Oh.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.698
We still don't have an actor
to play Luca Brasi.

24:58.798 --> 25:02.702
It's the last big role
we need to cast.

25:02.802 --> 25:05.772
Don't worry about it.
We'll find somebody.

25:08.675 --> 25:11.277
Just so we're clear,
I'm a grown woman.

25:11.377 --> 25:13.112
We both know what it was
and what it wasn't.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.047
Relax.

25:21.253 --> 25:23.656
You know how we said

25:23.756 --> 25:26.759
that we can make
this picture for 4 million?

25:26.859 --> 25:28.961
Well, unless half the crew
works for free,

25:29.061 --> 25:30.262
we're never gonna get there.
You gotta call Bob.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.599
No, that's a check
I can't cash.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.567
I used it all up on Pacino.

25:34.667 --> 25:37.003
What--so what?
You just quit?

25:37.103 --> 25:38.605
That's not fair.

25:38.705 --> 25:39.972
What does fair have to do
with anything?

25:50.282 --> 25:52.218
What's this?

25:52.318 --> 25:53.720
A script.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.057
It's called "Chinatown."

25:58.157 --> 25:59.892
Any good?

25:59.992 --> 26:02.762
A lot of talk about water
in the future.

26:02.862 --> 26:05.331
You think it would be dull,
but it's oddly compelling.

26:05.431 --> 26:07.834
Anything for me in it?

26:07.934 --> 26:09.335
No.

26:12.905 --> 26:16.876
Can we talk about something
that's important to me?

26:16.976 --> 26:19.078
Yeah. What?

26:19.178 --> 26:20.680
"The Getaway."

26:20.780 --> 26:22.081
We passed on it.

26:22.181 --> 26:25.652
Well, Warner Brothers didn't
and they're making it.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.253
Steve McQueen just signed on

26:27.353 --> 26:29.722
and there's a part
that I really want.

26:29.822 --> 26:32.158
McQueen is in prison,
helps a crook plan a heist.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.793
The crook betrays Steve,

26:33.893 --> 26:35.828
and they take off across Texas
with the money,

26:35.928 --> 26:38.631
running from the law
and the criminals.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.867
A strong woman, quick thinker.

26:40.967 --> 26:43.135
Walter Hill wrote it,
Peckinpah is directing,

26:43.235 --> 26:45.638
and--and they want me.

26:45.738 --> 26:47.106
It's not good enough
for you, Al,

26:47.206 --> 26:49.876
and I really don't have time
for this right now.

26:53.445 --> 26:56.148
I'm going to do it.

26:56.248 --> 26:57.316
Starts shooting next week.

26:57.416 --> 26:58.918
Do you want my opinion
or my blessing?

26:59.018 --> 27:01.754
I want you to support
my opinion with your blessing.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.322
How about I tell your agent
I'm not gonna work with him

27:03.422 --> 27:05.391
if they let you do this.
How about that?

27:05.491 --> 27:07.727
And destroy your marriage.

27:07.827 --> 27:08.761
Ali.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.196
Ali, come on.
Come back.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.331
Hey.
What?

27:12.431 --> 27:13.800
Look, I don't wanna fight,

27:13.900 --> 27:15.802
but I'm under a lot of pressure
right now.

27:15.902 --> 27:17.369
Thanks to you,
"Love Story" was a huge hit,

27:17.469 --> 27:19.872
but if "The Godfather"
doesn't follow, I'm fucked.

27:19.972 --> 27:24.043
I can't give Bluhdorn
a reason to sell, okay?

27:26.879 --> 27:29.381
Bob still hasn't returned
any of my calls.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.683
Sheila says
he's still pissed.

27:30.783 --> 27:31.884
He needs time to cool off.

27:32.952 --> 27:34.687
She said you should just
go to Bluhdorn yourself.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.288
Remind me never to cross
the assistant pool.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.290
It's more dangerous
in the mafia.

27:38.390 --> 27:41.360
You have no idea.

27:41.460 --> 27:43.095
You made any headway
with the budget?

27:43.195 --> 27:46.365
Not unless you got a couple
extra million lying around.

27:46.465 --> 27:48.935
Do you want me
to take a look at it?

27:49.035 --> 27:51.403
The budget? Yeah, sure.
Knock yourself out.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.973
You gonna take
Sheila's advice?

27:54.073 --> 27:55.074
Yeah.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.082
How is he today?

28:06.853 --> 28:08.721
Mr. Bluhdorn
will see you now.

28:08.821 --> 28:10.156
We're going in.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.127
You want more money.

28:15.227 --> 28:16.428
Charlie, come on.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.230
We just came by
to see how your day was going.

28:18.330 --> 28:19.866
Ah, it's all bullshit.

28:19.966 --> 28:23.202
This being polite is a waste
of at least an hour every day.

28:23.302 --> 28:24.336
How are you?

28:24.436 --> 28:26.705
How's your kids?
How's your wife?

28:26.806 --> 28:27.940
Well, what do you say?

28:28.040 --> 28:30.042
She's got a suspicious mole.
Who gives a shit?

28:30.142 --> 28:31.477
You're being polite.
That's your tell.

28:31.577 --> 28:33.012
You want more money

28:33.112 --> 28:35.281
and you agreed to do this film
for 4.5.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.083
It can't be done for 4.5.

28:37.183 --> 28:39.018
Low budget
specialist, my ass.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.220
Look, Charlie, I got all
the actors to work for scale,

28:41.320 --> 28:43.455
including Marlon Brando.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.257
I'm getting tax breaks
from the city.

28:45.357 --> 28:46.893
It's just still
not enough money.

28:46.993 --> 28:49.495
Have you spoken to Evans?

28:49.595 --> 28:51.297
He's not returning my calls.

28:51.397 --> 28:52.799
Oh, and who's fault is that?

28:52.899 --> 28:54.133
I warned you.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.936
You made this bed
you're sleeping in, Ruddy.

29:04.243 --> 29:07.046
I'm gonna make you an offer.

29:07.146 --> 29:09.448
Take it or leave it.

29:09.548 --> 29:13.119
Ruddy, you and Coppola
can get 6 million,

29:13.219 --> 29:15.421
but you both have to
put up your fees

29:15.521 --> 29:17.423
against any overages.

29:21.427 --> 29:22.294
We'll have to talk
about that.

29:22.394 --> 29:24.931
We'll take it.

29:25.031 --> 29:27.233
He spoke. We're done.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.001
Get the fuck out of my office.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.903
We could've gotten to 6.5.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.138
He said take it or leave it.

29:32.238 --> 29:33.772
Let it go, Al.

29:33.873 --> 29:36.175
The Corleones are expecting us
for dinner.

29:43.049 --> 29:45.117
Hey.

29:45.217 --> 29:48.087
We're in here.
Yeah, here we go.

29:48.187 --> 29:50.056
Very nice.

29:50.156 --> 29:53.259
Hello.
How you doing, Bob, Morgana?

29:53.359 --> 29:55.361
Talia.
Oh, look at you.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.528
Hey.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.130
John.
How are you, sir?

29:58.230 --> 29:59.465
Jimmy, come here.

29:59.565 --> 30:01.167
Look who's decided
to show up, huh?

30:01.267 --> 30:02.434
I guess you're the boss.
You're the boss.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.036
How are ya? Good.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.839
What's going on, buddy?
Hey, boss.

30:06.939 --> 30:10.542
Diane, Al, beautiful.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.879
Hey, look, it's Carlo.

30:12.979 --> 30:14.981
The douchebag has arrived.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.851
Here you go, Marlon.

30:18.951 --> 30:22.288
Thank you.
Thank you for being here.

30:22.388 --> 30:25.958
Ladies and gentlemen.

30:26.058 --> 30:28.260
Ladies and gentlemen,

30:28.360 --> 30:30.229
may I have your attention,
please?

30:34.566 --> 30:36.903
Oh, I want to thank you all
for coming out tonight.

30:37.003 --> 30:38.971
This is very exciting.

30:39.071 --> 30:40.339
You all look wonderful.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.274
And I just thought it would be
really nice

30:42.374 --> 30:45.111
to have the Corleone family
come together

30:45.211 --> 30:47.914
for a real Italian dinner, huh?

30:48.014 --> 30:50.049
Before we all start shooting
in a couple days.

30:50.149 --> 30:51.283
That's it.
Just enjoy yourself.

30:51.383 --> 30:54.921
Sit wherever you want
and let's eat.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.188
Mangia.

31:26.252 --> 31:26.953
Here you go.

31:27.053 --> 31:29.521
I'm not the head
of this family.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.991
Right.
I should help.

31:32.091 --> 31:33.592
Oh, no, no, no, no.
She's got it.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.261
Stay here with me.

31:35.361 --> 31:38.164
No, no.
Your mother first. Always.

31:46.105 --> 31:48.474
Are you gonna sit down
or what?

31:49.541 --> 31:51.610
You get any eggplant?
No.

31:51.710 --> 31:52.611
Well, you gotta try some.

31:52.711 --> 31:55.247
You want me to get you some?

31:55.347 --> 31:59.051
I--it's just I was gonna
get some anyway, you know?

31:59.151 --> 32:01.453
So I--I thought
I--I can get you some.

32:15.201 --> 32:17.336
I appreciate having
the whole family together

32:17.436 --> 32:20.006
for my birthday.

32:20.106 --> 32:22.074
Many things happen in life.

32:22.174 --> 32:27.046
Celebrations, tragedies,
births, deaths.

32:27.146 --> 32:28.247
But through it all,

32:28.347 --> 32:30.516
what's right here
is what's important.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.351
Family.

32:32.451 --> 32:33.485
May you live forever.

32:33.585 --> 32:36.655
Ah, salud.
Salud!

32:36.755 --> 32:38.390
Ooh-hoo.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.964
You make this?
Mm.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.134
Mom's recipe.

32:48.234 --> 32:49.701
Christ, it's the best
thing I ever put in my mouth.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.103
Mm-hmm.
Hey, stuggatz,

32:51.203 --> 32:53.105
you know how lucky you are?

32:53.205 --> 32:54.540
I think she's the lucky one.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.674
You don't know
what you're in for.

32:55.774 --> 32:56.708
You're gonna need both hands

32:56.808 --> 32:57.976
to deal with that one, right?

32:59.478 --> 33:02.148
I only need one hand
to enforce my rules.

33:03.549 --> 33:05.517
What did you just say?

33:05.617 --> 33:06.518
Did you just threaten her?

33:09.355 --> 33:11.690
Everybody needs a smack
once in a while.

33:11.790 --> 33:13.225
Hey, hey.

33:13.325 --> 33:16.362
Come on.

33:16.462 --> 33:19.331
That's enough.

33:19.431 --> 33:20.999
Who's this jamoke
think he is?

33:24.136 --> 33:25.404
Has this man
laid a hand on you?

33:25.504 --> 33:26.605
No, Pop. No, no.

33:26.705 --> 33:29.075
It--it--it was my fault.

33:29.175 --> 33:30.442
I didn't do nothing.

33:30.542 --> 33:33.679
You know what the name
"Corleone" means?

33:33.779 --> 33:36.215
"Heart of a lion."

33:36.315 --> 33:39.285
So if I were you,
I wouldn't bring any attention

33:39.385 --> 33:41.287
to the fact that
I'm the slowest in the herd.

33:50.596 --> 33:53.632
If I offended you,
I'm sorry, godfather.

33:53.732 --> 33:55.501
What do you have
to be sorry for?

33:55.601 --> 33:57.736
You said you never hit her.

33:57.836 --> 33:59.771
I'm just happy to be
in your family.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.407
Kiss the ring.

34:01.507 --> 34:03.242
Huh?

34:03.342 --> 34:04.276
Huh?

34:05.144 --> 34:06.345
Kiss the fucking ring,
you fucking idiot.

34:06.445 --> 34:07.079
Kiss it.

34:07.179 --> 34:09.581
- Kiss it.
- Kiss it.

34:09.681 --> 34:13.319
Kiss it, kiss it, kiss it.

34:13.419 --> 34:14.420
Hey, kiss it.

34:14.520 --> 34:15.554
Kiss it, kiss it.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.723
Kiss it.

34:17.823 --> 34:19.825
Kiss it, kiss it!

34:22.794 --> 34:24.363
Everybody mangia.

34:26.165 --> 34:29.501
Can you believe
this guy, huh?

34:29.601 --> 34:31.137
You know what I'm thinking?

34:31.237 --> 34:32.704
This is gonna be
a great film.

34:32.804 --> 34:33.739
Yeah.

34:33.839 --> 34:36.308
And they need a stove.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.843
You had to bring that up,
didn't you?

34:37.943 --> 34:40.312
Can't I just have
one good moment

34:40.412 --> 34:42.414
without it being taken away
from me on this project?

34:42.514 --> 34:43.815
I'm sorry.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.351
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

34:45.451 --> 34:47.586
But food is so important
to this family.

34:47.686 --> 34:50.322
Well, this family is gonna
have to get by with one burner.

34:50.422 --> 34:51.623
Yeah?

34:54.760 --> 34:57.095
Hey! Al.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.465
I heard last night went well.

34:59.565 --> 35:01.167
Your friend Gianni
didn't think so.

35:01.267 --> 35:03.169
What a schmegege.

35:06.905 --> 35:10.642
So I've been going through
the budget.

35:10.742 --> 35:12.211
Uh-huh.

35:12.311 --> 35:13.512
And?

35:13.612 --> 35:16.114
And there seem to be

35:16.215 --> 35:18.784
three men with
very Italian-sounding names.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.886
They don't belong
to any department.

35:20.986 --> 35:22.521
They're on payroll,

35:22.621 --> 35:25.557
but I can't find them
on the crew list.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.125
Al.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.261
One of them is Caesar.

35:29.361 --> 35:30.562
Caesar, I just saw him
at the wake.

35:30.662 --> 35:32.398
He didn't mention anything.
Who hired him?

35:32.498 --> 35:34.132
Probably one of the unions.

35:34.233 --> 35:36.635
That's not weirdest part.

35:36.735 --> 35:38.870
All three of these guys,

35:38.970 --> 35:43.442
they have the same
social security number.

35:43.542 --> 35:44.743
Really?

35:44.843 --> 35:46.545
I don't know
why you find that funny.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.880
Gulf and Western
is a publicly-traded company.

35:48.980 --> 35:52.351
If they find out
we have mobsters on payroll,

35:52.451 --> 35:54.520
it's over for all of us.

35:54.620 --> 35:57.723
Look, get me Caesar.
I'll talk to him.

36:03.762 --> 36:08.867
Caesar.

36:08.967 --> 36:10.236
What's this about?

36:10.336 --> 36:11.903
You could have finished lunch.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.905
That's not how I like
to do things.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.442
Never make the boss wait.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.910
Right.
Let me ask you something.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.813
What exactly do you do here?

36:21.913 --> 36:24.516
I am a production assistant.

36:24.616 --> 36:27.619
And who do you assist?

36:27.719 --> 36:28.920
The production.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.358
And what does production do?

36:32.458 --> 36:35.427
Like, if there's a problem
with the unions,

36:35.527 --> 36:40.232
I assist the unions
to not be a problem.

36:40.332 --> 36:42.501
Moving right along.

36:42.601 --> 36:45.971
These guys down here,
what do they do?

36:46.071 --> 36:48.474
Those are my guys.
They're, um...

36:48.574 --> 36:51.843
production assistant's
assistants.

36:51.943 --> 36:53.345
Listen, you guys can't all

36:53.445 --> 36:56.214
have the same
social security number.

36:56.315 --> 37:00.719
Al, you know who you gotta
talk to about that.

37:00.819 --> 37:01.753
You need anything else, boss?

37:01.853 --> 37:04.323
'Cause, um,
I gotta take a dump.

37:04.423 --> 37:06.292
Good luck with that.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.598
How you doing?
Hi.

37:16.735 --> 37:20.005
Al, there are two FBI agents
waiting for you.

37:25.444 --> 37:27.313
Thanks so much for seeing us
on short notice.

37:27.413 --> 37:29.348
I'm Agent Zabel.
This is Agent Richman.

37:29.448 --> 37:30.949
What can I do for you boys?

37:31.049 --> 37:32.784
What exactly do you do here,
Mr. Ruddy?

37:32.884 --> 37:34.620
I'm the producer.

37:34.720 --> 37:35.654
You mind telling us

37:36.555 --> 37:38.357
why you were at
Carmine Vispiciano's wake?

37:38.457 --> 37:40.892
He was a friend.
Where's this going?

37:40.992 --> 37:42.461
Well, I guess
we were just wondering

37:42.561 --> 37:43.895
how a man with
top security clearance

37:43.995 --> 37:44.963
with the Rand Corporation

37:45.063 --> 37:48.367
is now in bed with the mafia.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.471
Well, fellas,

37:52.571 --> 37:56.508
you know how they say that
truth is stranger than fiction?

37:57.075 --> 37:59.645
I see nothing, nothing!

38:00.912 --> 38:02.280
Exactly.
That's pretty good.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.282
So why did you walk away
from "Hogan's Heroes"?

38:04.383 --> 38:06.352
TV's too limiting.

38:06.452 --> 38:08.687
You can't tell real stories
on TV.

38:08.787 --> 38:09.788
It's fake.

38:09.888 --> 38:13.058
And Marlon Brando
doesn't do TV.

38:13.158 --> 38:14.793
Al, you seem like a nice guy.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.462
Let me give you some advice.

38:16.562 --> 38:17.929
These guys are a lot
more dangerous

38:18.029 --> 38:19.465
than they first appear.
Look, honestly,

38:19.565 --> 38:21.367
I'm just trying
to make my movie

38:21.467 --> 38:23.669
and that's where
the association ends.

38:23.769 --> 38:26.405
So I gave one of them a job,
hence the badge.

38:26.505 --> 38:28.039
It's safer for him here
than working out there.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.475
Not safer for you.

38:29.575 --> 38:30.576
And we'd feel a lot better

38:30.676 --> 38:31.977
if we can keep
a closer eye on you.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.078
If you let us
put a wire on you,

38:33.178 --> 38:35.013
we can protect you.

38:38.850 --> 38:43.622
I appreciate it, guys, but
I'll take my chances on my own.

38:49.528 --> 38:51.497
Yeah, she's gonna do
"The Getaway" next.

38:51.597 --> 38:54.433
Well, Peckinpah
is a great director.

38:54.533 --> 38:56.535
We just figured it was the
best move after "Love Story"

38:56.635 --> 39:01.106
so she doesn't get typecast
as the shiksa goddess.

39:01.206 --> 39:03.375
No, no, I--I've never worked
with McQueen.

39:03.475 --> 39:04.342
What do you know about him,
Cary?

39:06.612 --> 39:08.414
Look, I gotta go, Cary.

39:08.514 --> 39:10.816
Thank you so much for the info
and I'll speak soon.

39:10.916 --> 39:11.850
All right, bye.

39:11.950 --> 39:15.821
It's Lapidus.

39:15.921 --> 39:16.955
Barry!

39:17.055 --> 39:18.023
How they hanging?

39:18.123 --> 39:19.758
Guess what I'm calling about.

39:19.858 --> 39:22.961
Another sock sale
at Brooks Brothers?

39:23.061 --> 39:26.364
You were right about
"Love Story."

39:26.465 --> 39:27.365
Well, thank you, Barry.

39:27.466 --> 39:28.700
Maybe I do know what I'm doing.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.969
You have made the board
very happy.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.939
Gulf and Western's
stock price is up.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.774
Nice work, Bobby.

39:50.656 --> 39:52.858
Peter, I just had
a wacko call from Lapidus.

39:52.958 --> 39:54.092
Aubrey wasn't bluffing.

39:54.192 --> 39:56.562
They're trying
to sell Paramount.

39:56.962 --> 40:00.499
And?

40:00.599 --> 40:01.933
Tastes like fish bait.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.769
But is too small
to slip on a hook.

40:03.869 --> 40:04.936
Ugh.

40:05.036 --> 40:06.137
That's impossible.

40:06.237 --> 40:09.441
It's $200 caviar
from the Caspian Sea.

40:09.541 --> 40:12.644
I don't care if it was $1,000
and came out of God's ass.

40:12.744 --> 40:15.080
If I'm eating eggs,
I want 'em cracked, fried,

40:15.180 --> 40:16.748
and covered in cheese.

40:20.486 --> 40:22.087
I'm glad you could make
some time for me.

40:22.187 --> 40:23.922
I know Ruddy
keeps you very busy.

40:24.022 --> 40:25.491
Yeah.

40:25.591 --> 40:28.126
Well, anything
for a free drink.

40:31.129 --> 40:33.565
So tell me,

40:33.665 --> 40:36.668
what does Bettye want?

40:36.768 --> 40:38.970
I'm not sure what you mean.

40:39.070 --> 40:39.905
What do you want
for yourself?

40:40.005 --> 40:42.608
What do you want to do
with your life?

40:42.708 --> 40:44.910
What is this?

40:45.010 --> 40:46.978
Are you trying to be
my mentor now or something?

40:47.078 --> 40:50.482
Do you enjoy
working as Ruddy's secretary,

40:50.582 --> 40:53.218
pouring coffee,
answering phones?

40:53.318 --> 40:56.454
Ah, is that
what you think I do?

40:56.555 --> 40:58.223
Well, that's what
all secretaries do.

40:58.323 --> 40:59.591
That's what
they're supposed to do.

40:59.691 --> 41:02.894
I'm not all secretaries.

41:02.994 --> 41:03.995
No, you're not.

41:04.095 --> 41:06.064
No.

41:07.899 --> 41:09.668
Come work for me.

41:11.603 --> 41:15.607
Ah, for once,
she has nothing to say.

41:15.707 --> 41:17.208
I work for Ruddy.
He works for me

41:17.308 --> 41:20.478
so technically
you already work for me.

41:20.579 --> 41:23.248
With all due respect, Charlie,

41:23.348 --> 41:25.350
I love where I am.

41:29.220 --> 41:31.857
They say movies are magic,

41:31.957 --> 41:33.224
but they don't care
about magic.

41:33.324 --> 41:36.494
They care about money.

41:36.595 --> 41:38.930
And so do I.

41:42.701 --> 41:45.103
You're selling Paramount.

41:45.203 --> 41:48.540
I never said that.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.842
I like you, Bettye.

41:50.942 --> 41:54.079
Think about it.

41:54.179 --> 41:55.213
Who else knows?

41:55.313 --> 41:56.948
I assume the word
is already out.

41:57.048 --> 41:58.817
Did he say anything
about the movie?

41:58.917 --> 42:00.952
Not exactly.

42:01.052 --> 42:03.722
You speak Charlie.
What did he say exactly?

42:07.959 --> 42:10.629
He offered me a job.

42:12.631 --> 42:13.732
I'll tell you
what they're doing, Peter.

42:13.832 --> 42:16.868
They are using my success
against me.

42:16.968 --> 42:19.004
Yeah.
Nothing's set in stone.

42:19.104 --> 42:20.639
They fought me tooth and nail.

42:20.739 --> 42:22.007
They told me not to make
"Love Story."

42:22.107 --> 42:23.609
I put my balls on the line.

42:23.709 --> 42:24.810
I knew people wanted a romance.

42:24.910 --> 42:26.211
I knew that Ali was a star.

42:26.311 --> 42:27.946
I knew people would
fall in love with her.

42:28.046 --> 42:30.849
I fucking delivered
the biggest movie ever. Ever.

42:30.949 --> 42:33.118
And now they're taking
my baby away,

42:33.218 --> 42:34.786
selling her off
for spare parts?

42:34.886 --> 42:37.088
I don't think so.
Fuck that.

42:41.126 --> 42:43.829
What the fuck?

42:43.929 --> 42:45.831
Hey!

42:45.931 --> 42:47.733
Hey!

42:47.833 --> 42:49.267
What are you doing here?

42:49.367 --> 42:52.570
We've got to work order to
map out the cemetery expansion.

42:52.671 --> 42:55.306
Get the fuck off my lot.

42:55.406 --> 42:56.608
Excuse me?

42:56.708 --> 43:00.178
I said
get the fuck off my lot!

43:00.278 --> 43:02.113
Hey, hey, hey.

43:02.213 --> 43:04.249
This is exactly what I said
was gonna happen.

43:04.349 --> 43:05.684
I heard you were

43:05.784 --> 43:06.918
asking Caesar
a lot of questions.

43:07.018 --> 43:08.153
No, no, Joe,

43:09.220 --> 43:09.988
I was just curious about--
Hey, look, Al,

43:10.956 --> 43:11.757
I don't like to talk business
over the phone.

43:12.390 --> 43:12.924
Come by the League office.

43:13.792 --> 43:14.325
We can talk about
whatever you want.

43:15.193 --> 43:15.661
Joe,
I'm a little busy right now.

43:16.394 --> 43:17.595
Great, I'll see you in an hour.

43:24.736 --> 43:26.772
I gotta go see him.
Hold down the fort.

43:26.872 --> 43:28.306
In the middle of all this?

43:28.406 --> 43:30.742
He called for me.
I gotta go.

43:30.842 --> 43:33.278
You sound like a gangster.

43:33.378 --> 43:34.880
Be back in an hour.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.615
If you're not, I'm gonna send
for your special agents.

43:37.716 --> 43:39.951
I'm sure they'll be around.

43:44.289 --> 43:47.292
Big day tomorrow.
You ready?

43:47.392 --> 43:48.626
Yeah, I'm just going over
the scene, like,

43:48.727 --> 43:50.195
a million times in my head.

43:50.295 --> 43:51.296
Is the weather gonna be bad?

43:51.396 --> 43:53.665
Clear skies, 45 degrees.

43:53.765 --> 43:55.701
Perfect weather.

43:55.801 --> 43:57.936
I just can't believe
that it's actually

43:58.036 --> 44:00.338
beginning tomorrow.
I know.

44:00.438 --> 44:01.406
You made it happen.

44:01.506 --> 44:02.741
We.

44:02.841 --> 44:05.010
We made it happen.

44:05.110 --> 44:07.345
It's a miracle.

44:07.445 --> 44:09.715
Everything that
we've been through.

44:11.049 --> 44:13.384
They said that
this was not going to succeed.

44:13.484 --> 44:15.120
They did.

44:15.220 --> 44:18.089
And now it's up to me
to make sure that it does.

44:18.189 --> 44:19.357
And it will.

44:19.457 --> 44:21.259
And you're gonna
make it happen, Francis.

44:21.359 --> 44:23.094
It's gonna be great.

44:25.831 --> 44:28.233
Hey.
Good to see you, Al.

44:28.333 --> 44:31.837
Come on.
He's inside waiting for you.

44:31.937 --> 44:33.872
And it's because
of courageous men

44:33.972 --> 44:35.841
like Congressman Biaggi,

44:35.941 --> 44:38.043
who's willing to fight
for Italian Americans,

44:38.143 --> 44:40.746
that we're able to make
any progress with civil rights.

44:40.846 --> 44:42.380
That's why the League
wholeheartedly

44:42.480 --> 44:43.949
throws its support

44:44.049 --> 44:46.451
behind the Congressman
for his re-election.

44:46.551 --> 44:50.989
Yes. Thank you, thank you.

44:51.089 --> 44:52.924
Oh, oh, oh.

44:53.024 --> 44:56.161
I'd also like to announce that

44:56.261 --> 44:59.464
after intense negotiations
with Gulf and Western,

44:59.564 --> 45:00.999
the League has decided
to allow them

45:01.099 --> 45:03.468
to make the movie,
"The Godfather."

45:03.568 --> 45:05.070
That's right.

45:05.170 --> 45:07.072
And I--and I should say

45:07.172 --> 45:09.841
that it's all because of this
man right there, Al Ruddy.

45:09.941 --> 45:12.710
Al, come up here. Come up here.
He's the film's producer.

45:12.811 --> 45:13.879
It's because of him
that we were able

45:13.979 --> 45:15.814
to come to this agreement.

45:15.914 --> 45:18.083
It was his brilliant idea
that Gulf and Western

45:18.183 --> 45:19.951
donate the proceeds
from the premiere

45:20.051 --> 45:21.820
to the League's hospital fund.

45:21.920 --> 45:23.855
We can't thank you enough, Al.

45:23.955 --> 45:25.891
This is the man
solely responsible

45:25.991 --> 45:27.926
for the alliance
between the Italian League,

45:28.026 --> 45:30.728
Gulf and Western,
and Paramount Pictures.

45:30.829 --> 45:32.230
You're one of us.

45:32.330 --> 45:33.932
Hey, come on, come up here.

45:34.032 --> 45:36.101
Come on, take a picture.

45:36.201 --> 45:37.502
How long have you
been working with Mr. Colombo?

45:37.602 --> 45:39.070
Come up. Come on.

45:39.170 --> 45:40.071
And what are the details

45:40.171 --> 45:41.372
of this financial relationship?

45:41.472 --> 45:42.874
Take a picture.
Take a picture.

45:42.974 --> 45:43.842
How does
Paramount Pictures feel

45:43.942 --> 45:45.376
about this, Mr. Ruddy?

45:45.476 --> 45:47.212
Is it true that the
movie is still about the mafia?

45:47.312 --> 45:48.814
How does
Gulf and Western feel

45:48.914 --> 45:51.116
about being in business
with Joe Colombo?

47:08.226 --> 47:10.561
You're in bed with the mafia
for the whole world to see.

47:10.661 --> 47:12.197
I did what I had to do.

47:13.264 --> 47:15.133
They don't get it.
So make them get it.

47:15.233 --> 47:16.935
You try to say no
to Joe Colombo,

47:17.035 --> 47:18.269
let me know how that works out
for you.

47:18.369 --> 47:19.570
We cannot have another war.

47:19.670 --> 47:21.472
You should have stayed
in prison.

47:21.973 --> 47:23.374
It was safer for you there.

47:23.674 --> 47:24.575
Action!

47:24.675 --> 47:26.144
We know people want...

47:26.477 --> 47:28.046
violence...

47:28.446 --> 47:30.048
Where's Ruddy?
Ruddy?

47:31.849 --> 47:32.617
It wasn't personal,
it was business.

47:32.717 --> 47:34.085
Just business, huh?

47:34.185 --> 47:36.621
Unfortunate things
present opportunities.

47:37.488 --> 47:39.057
Sometimes it is personal.

47:46.264 --> 47:50.368
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention please?

47:50.635 --> 47:52.437
The Patsy's cast dinner.

47:52.637 --> 47:53.972
It's just a favorite
scene of mine.

47:54.072 --> 47:55.073
It's a great scene.

47:56.174 --> 47:59.945
Coppola had a dinner at
Patsy's for the Corleone cast.

48:00.045 --> 48:01.646
I just thought it would
be really nice to have

48:02.313 --> 48:05.116
the Corleone family
come together
for a real Italian dinner.

48:05.216 --> 48:06.251
And he didn't tell them

48:06.351 --> 48:07.652
to play their
characters or anything.

48:07.752 --> 48:09.020
He just wanted to
have a nice dinner

48:10.255 --> 48:10.956
with all the main characters
before they started shooting.

48:11.923 --> 48:15.193
Bringing all of
these actors together

48:15.293 --> 48:20.065
allowed for a subtle
alchemy to be present.

48:20.165 --> 48:23.368
And at that dinner they
all started, weirdly,

48:23.468 --> 48:24.970
assuming their parts.

48:25.070 --> 48:26.437
Let's eat.
Mangia.

48:31.309 --> 48:33.411
Talia Shire started
bringing platters over

48:33.611 --> 48:34.912
to serve the table.

48:35.013 --> 48:36.147
I'm not the head of this family.

48:36.247 --> 48:37.983
Brando sat at
the head of the table.

48:38.083 --> 48:39.584
No, no.
Your mother first, always.

48:39.684 --> 48:41.286
The three sons started to jockey

48:41.386 --> 48:43.021
for position to
sit next to Brando.

48:43.121 --> 48:44.322
You get any eggplant?

48:44.422 --> 48:45.123
No.

48:46.291 --> 48:47.058
Well, you gotta try some.
You want me to get you some?

48:47.892 --> 48:48.526
I think that this was the place

48:49.360 --> 48:51.329
where the Corleone
family was born.

48:51.429 --> 48:53.464
I appreciate having
the whole family together

48:53.564 --> 48:54.432
for my birthday.

48:55.300 --> 48:56.167
It's just a really great scene,

48:57.168 --> 48:58.603
A great idea, to show
them being loose with it.

48:58.703 --> 49:00.205
To show the family
becoming a family.

49:00.305 --> 49:02.140
What's right here
is what's important.

49:02.607 --> 49:03.508
Family.

49:04.375 --> 49:05.343
There was a very
delicate balance

49:06.211 --> 49:08.613
to allowing these
people to come to life

49:08.713 --> 49:12.217
in a way where we began to see

49:12.317 --> 49:14.519
not Al Pacino but
Michael Corleone.

49:15.120 --> 49:18.023
You know what
the name Corleone means?
Heart of a lion.

49:18.123 --> 49:19.957
Not Jimmy Caan, but Sonny.

49:20.058 --> 49:21.392
The douche bag has arrived.

49:21.492 --> 49:23.061
There was
something about that dinner

49:23.161 --> 49:24.362
that always stood out to us

49:25.463 --> 49:27.498
because you could see Coppola
and Ruddy sitting there

49:27.598 --> 49:31.002
watching the dynamics of
the Corleone family play out

49:31.102 --> 49:33.038
and understand that they
had something special.

49:33.138 --> 49:34.372
You know what I'm thinking?

49:34.705 --> 49:36.307
This is gonna be a great film.

49:36.407 --> 49:38.643
Yeah!
Thank you, everybody.

49:42.413 --> 49:45.016
You told me, do whatever it
takes to get my movie made.

49:45.116 --> 49:46.684
You said to color
outside the lines.

49:46.784 --> 49:48.419
I never told you
to fuck me over.

49:48.519 --> 49:51.556
From Bob's standpoint,
he wanted a star.

49:51.656 --> 49:53.124
He's like,
"I don't like Pacino!"

49:53.424 --> 49:56.027
Ruddy goes to
Bluhdorn behind his back

49:56.127 --> 49:58.029
and says, "We need Al Pacino."

49:58.129 --> 49:59.397
I'm gonna make you an offer.

49:59.497 --> 50:01.699
It was just brutally
difficult, but he had to do it.

50:01.799 --> 50:04.602
He didn't want this
unheard of kid.

50:04.702 --> 50:05.736
He already had Brando.

50:06.771 --> 50:07.738
He's like, you know, it
was already exacerbating

50:08.406 --> 50:09.340
going into a land of chaos.

50:10.475 --> 50:12.177
But I suppose the sort of
Shakespearean part of that is

50:12.277 --> 50:13.578
he felt like he'd been
stabbed in the back.

50:13.678 --> 50:15.746
It was a sort of a Julius Caesar
moment for him.

50:15.846 --> 50:17.515
It was for the
good of the movie.

50:17.615 --> 50:20.051
Then his sort
of major confidante was Ali.

50:20.385 --> 50:24.122
I love working with Matthew.
It's really no acting necessary.

50:24.222 --> 50:26.224
He is a consummate pro.

50:26.324 --> 50:27.492
I think I'm doing both
of us a favor.

50:27.592 --> 50:31.329
Watching Matthew create
organically, take to take,

50:31.429 --> 50:33.264
and his incredible range
as an actor,

50:33.364 --> 50:35.733
but also having all of that
range fit so beautifully

50:35.833 --> 50:37.068
inside of Robert Evans.

50:37.268 --> 50:39.137
It's not good enough for you Al

50:39.237 --> 50:41.372
and I really don't have
time for this right now.

50:41.472 --> 50:43.308
So dependable
as a scene partner.

50:43.408 --> 50:47.412
Working with him did feel
like I was always being held.

50:47.512 --> 50:48.379
I'm going to do it.

50:49.447 --> 50:50.415
He goes and watches
The Panic in Needle Park

50:51.116 --> 50:51.816
and he sits in there with Ali.

50:52.617 --> 50:53.418
Pacino doesn't
have to say a word

50:54.219 --> 50:55.153
and I can't take
my eyes off him.

50:56.721 --> 50:59.056
In the end, he's like, "Well,
he is actually really good,
this guy."

50:59.157 --> 51:00.658
Which is wonderful, and then--

51:00.758 --> 51:01.826
Listen to me.

51:01.926 --> 51:04.629
You're still a putz,
but I got Pacino.

51:04.729 --> 51:06.131
He's in the picture.

51:06.431 --> 51:08.499
Bob. Thank you.
I can't tell you how much--
