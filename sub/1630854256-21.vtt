WEBVTT

00:06.540 --> 00:08.276
Kerry Adams, ATF SAC,
Los Angeles.

00:08.376 --> 00:10.544
<i>We have an agent who has been</i>

00:10.644 --> 00:12.380
<i>under deep cover
working a weapons case.</i>

00:12.480 --> 00:14.248
<i>His name is William Newsome.</i>

00:14.348 --> 00:16.950
<i>He is a battle-tested,
high-functioning operative.</i>

00:17.985 --> 00:20.621
He is not somebody
you want to cross.

00:20.721 --> 00:24.492
And you think maybe
he has lost his way?

00:24.592 --> 00:26.260
There have been rumors.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.696
<i>I would like for your people
to see what they can learn.</i>

00:29.930 --> 00:31.199
So, work with
the guy, but...

00:31.299 --> 00:32.266
don't let him shoot you
in the back of the head?

00:32.366 --> 00:33.467
Yeah, something like that.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.136
I've been undercover
for seven months.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.171
Nobody can seem to figure out
who's running this organization,

00:37.271 --> 00:38.506
or where they're getting

00:38.606 --> 00:40.108
their military-grade
weapons inventory.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.476
They want to offload
the weapons and then disappear?

00:42.576 --> 00:44.678
Yes, that's why I need
to get back there ASAP.

00:44.778 --> 00:47.648
We'll have two of our agents
provide overwatch for you.

00:47.748 --> 00:50.050
Unless he plans
to use you as an alibi.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.385
Or a trap.

00:51.485 --> 00:52.820
Chatter on the wires
is that these guys

00:52.920 --> 00:55.189
float above the law
because of primo intel.

00:55.289 --> 00:56.590
There we go.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.492
I got two large Sprinter vans approaching.

00:58.592 --> 00:59.893
Boss man said
the payment just cleared.

00:59.993 --> 01:02.263
We're gonna deliver
the merch today.

01:02.363 --> 01:03.431
We don't even have merch.

01:03.531 --> 01:04.965
Where are these
weapons, anyway?

01:05.065 --> 01:06.667
I don't like
all your questions.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.502
You don't like 'em or
you don't understand 'em?

01:08.602 --> 01:11.739
<i>It seems that Special
Agent in Charge Kerry Adams</i>

01:11.839 --> 01:13.641
<i>has been on the take for years.</i>

01:13.741 --> 01:15.576
Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.678
Have you lost your minds?

01:17.778 --> 01:18.812
Now.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.961
Guys, you're outgunned.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.037
We got to move.

01:44.138 --> 01:45.639
I don't think we can
get to the long guns.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.007
Go wide?

01:47.107 --> 01:48.709
On your call.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.043
Let's do it.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.681
Go!

02:12.733 --> 02:13.901
Clear.

02:14.001 --> 02:14.968
Clear.
Fatima.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.171
We're gonna need
an ambulance.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.439
Copy that.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.409
How... the hell...

02:21.509 --> 02:23.311
did you...?

02:23.411 --> 02:24.845
Well, you know what they say:

02:24.945 --> 02:27.080
it's not the size of the gun,
it's how you use it.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.441
So Adams' plan
this entire time

02:53.541 --> 02:54.842
was to pin this on Newsome?

02:54.942 --> 02:56.710
Unless Newsome and Adams
were working together.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.446
We still don't know
if he's dirty or not.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.514
But if they were
working together,

03:00.614 --> 03:01.515
why would she try
to convince us

03:01.615 --> 03:02.716
that Newsome was dirty?

03:02.816 --> 03:03.784
Well, it gives her a scapegoat

03:03.884 --> 03:05.052
in case things go sideways.

03:05.152 --> 03:06.254
If Newsome was clean,

03:06.354 --> 03:07.321
she may have had the mercs

03:07.421 --> 03:08.756
at the mansion take him out.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.023
But if he's dirty,
that means Kensi and Deeks

03:10.123 --> 03:11.259
are the ones in trouble.

03:11.359 --> 03:13.361
Either way, it's not good
for somebody.

03:13.461 --> 03:15.329
All right, give
the admiral a sitrep.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.730
Get word to Kensi and Deeks,

03:16.830 --> 03:18.666
let them know this thing
could still go either way.

03:18.766 --> 03:19.667
They need to keep
their heads on a swivel.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.134
Yeah. Will do.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.836
All right, we've been in contact
with Commander Collins

03:22.936 --> 03:24.572
about the list
of weapons and ordnance

03:24.672 --> 03:26.374
that we received
from Agent Newsome.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.676
Get this. About 90%
of those weapons

03:28.776 --> 03:30.844
are being used by the military
in Argentina.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.347
All right, have Kilbride
send an inventory list

03:33.447 --> 03:34.848
to the Argentinian NIS.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.350
And make it very clear
we have reason to believe

03:36.450 --> 03:38.352
there may be widespread
theft in their bunkers.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.620
Copy that.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.691
<i>I'm out of snacks.
Did you bring any?</i>

03:43.791 --> 03:46.727
No, because we're on overwatch,
not a picnic.

03:46.827 --> 03:49.497
Yeah, well, an army
travels on its stomach.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.731
You are not in the Army.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.165
I was in the KISS Army.

03:52.266 --> 03:53.634
Okay, can we just focus, please?

03:53.734 --> 03:54.668
On what, exactly?

03:54.768 --> 03:55.769
We don't even know which way

03:55.869 --> 03:57.237
the wind is
blowing on this.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.373
is he a white hat,
is he a black hat?

03:59.473 --> 04:00.408
What's your gut say?

04:00.508 --> 04:01.942
Oh, my gut?

04:02.042 --> 04:03.844
It's still recovering
from you food poisoning me.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.413
I'm not taking that bait.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.448
My guy says 50/50, right?

04:07.548 --> 04:09.049
I mean, Newsome didn't
want an earpiece.

04:09.149 --> 04:11.018
Said it was for his own safety,
but maybe it's because

04:11.118 --> 04:13.253
he knew what was going on
this whole entire time.

04:13.354 --> 04:14.588
Yeah, but even if he's dirty,

04:14.688 --> 04:15.856
he could still wear
his earpiece.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.124
I mean, there's no real risk

04:17.224 --> 04:18.326
of it being discovered
by his crew.

04:18.426 --> 04:19.460
Right?
And he could keep

04:19.560 --> 04:20.661
tabs on us.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.195
That is a good point.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.397
So where does that leave us?

04:23.497 --> 04:25.299
Leaves us on overwatch...
Mm-hmm.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.300
...waiting...

04:26.400 --> 04:28.536
Mm-hmm.
...quietly.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.674
You want to play
"I Spy"?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.576
Emphasis on "quietly."

04:35.676 --> 04:37.210
I could whisper.

04:37.311 --> 04:38.746
Not without a tongue.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.049
...I spy,

04:42.149 --> 04:43.884
a rej...

04:43.984 --> 04:45.919
You're right,
that's very difficult.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.158
Hello, hello.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.494
Well, you sure
took your sweet time.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.895
Well, some of us

04:54.995 --> 04:56.697
actually care about
our appearance in public.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.332
She made us stop for Starbucks.

04:58.432 --> 04:59.900
I needed a coffee.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.369
Black. It takes two seconds.

05:01.469 --> 05:02.536
You're the one

05:02.636 --> 05:03.937
who had to order
a fancy, girly drink

05:04.037 --> 05:06.173
with 12 ingredients
that takes 20 minutes

05:06.273 --> 05:08.008
and a team of six
to hand-craft.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.242
This isn't fancy

05:09.343 --> 05:11.311
and it didn't take 20 minutes. Yeah.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.914
Right, Zoomer. I mean,
it was so embarrassing.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.616
I can never set foot
in there again.

05:16.917 --> 05:17.885
We'll take it from here, Castor.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.753
Gladly. She's all yours.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.689
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.657
I cannot imagine him
in a restaurant.

05:23.757 --> 05:24.858
Clearly we have
different definitions

05:24.958 --> 05:26.660
of the word "urgent."

05:26.760 --> 05:28.128
Oh, I'm sorry,

05:28.228 --> 05:30.664
I-I keep forgetting that
I'm on your payroll.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.366
Oh, wait. I'm not.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.535
God, is-is he always like this?

05:34.635 --> 05:36.370
Only when someone
tries to kill him.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.671
Oh, well...

05:37.771 --> 05:39.507
I imagine that's, like,
every other day.

05:39.607 --> 05:40.908
You know,
it's funny:

05:41.008 --> 05:43.010
people love Sam,
nobody ever shoots up his car,

05:43.110 --> 05:45.012
unless you're around, of course.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.281
Hey, you know I'm a licensed
private investigator.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.384
I think you and I
would make a great team

05:50.484 --> 05:51.952
in the private sector.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.187
You find out who's
running this operation?

05:54.287 --> 05:56.256
You want a car wash
with that, too?

05:56.356 --> 05:57.290
This guy.

05:57.391 --> 05:58.926
God.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.828
All right, no, I have no names,

06:00.928 --> 06:02.262
but I do know that
the weapons are being

06:02.362 --> 06:03.564
paid for through

06:03.664 --> 06:04.532
an underground currency
transfer system.

06:04.632 --> 06:05.999
Hawala?

06:06.099 --> 06:08.068
Well, kind of, except this one
is specifically

06:08.168 --> 06:10.871
for Americans who deal
in cash businesses.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.339
What kind of cash businesses?

06:12.440 --> 06:13.874
The kind you don't ask about.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.209
Do you get to pick
your own partners?

06:16.309 --> 06:17.277
Not always.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.579
Yeah...

06:18.679 --> 06:19.847
I don't suppose you have

06:19.947 --> 06:21.148
one of these
illegal accounts, huh?

06:21.248 --> 06:23.417
Well, "illegal" is your word,
not mine.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.818
And I may
or may not

06:24.918 --> 06:26.754
have one of these accounts,

06:26.854 --> 06:29.623
but it's beside the point
because I have immunity.

06:29.723 --> 06:30.991
You don't have immunity.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.393
All right, let's call it
a skosh of immunity

06:33.494 --> 06:34.795
as it relates to me helping you,

06:34.895 --> 06:36.864
which I can help.
I can get you in there,

06:36.964 --> 06:39.099
but it's up to you to get
the info on the seller.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.334
Where do they keep
that information stored?

06:41.435 --> 06:44.104
On an air-gapped computer
in a secured building.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.174
Well, that sounds like
a walk in the park.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.977
Oh, yeah.
It's gonna be super easy.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.650
<i>Wow.</i>

06:56.750 --> 06:58.652
That's a fun little contraption. Hmm.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.121
Let me guess,
Kilbride's idea?
Yup.

07:01.221 --> 07:04.057
Yeah, he had something like
this at his place in Texas,

07:04.157 --> 07:05.626
except it came out
of the ground.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.094
I didn't know he lived in Texas.

07:07.194 --> 07:09.963
Oh, well, uh, he didn't
really live there,

07:10.063 --> 07:11.965
and, you know,
an armory like this

07:12.065 --> 07:13.400
isn't a big deal in Texas.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.836
Oh, wow, damn.
Nice jacket.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.305
Going undercover
with Ben Baller.

07:18.405 --> 07:19.907
No, that'd be Switch.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.475
You're hilarious.

07:21.575 --> 07:22.976
Oh, are you a little jealous

07:23.076 --> 07:25.946
that Mr. Carl might have
a little more style than Switch?

07:26.046 --> 07:27.014
Who's Mr. Carl?

07:27.114 --> 07:28.649
That's Callen's street cover.

07:28.749 --> 07:29.750
Oh, let me guess.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.985
Uh, chinos, cardigan...

07:32.085 --> 07:33.487
Kind of like
a butch Mister Rogers.

07:33.587 --> 07:34.755
Mm.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.289
Butch Mister Rogers.
That's funny.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.891
Okay, can we just
get out of here now, please?

07:37.991 --> 07:39.159
Clearly somebody woke up

07:39.259 --> 07:40.360
on the wrong side
of his neighborhood.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.162
Uh, yeah.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.641
Don't look like anyone's here.

07:53.741 --> 07:55.876
Yeah, they have businesses
like this all over town.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.311
You know, out of business,
under construction.

07:58.411 --> 07:59.580
This way they can
do what they want

07:59.680 --> 08:01.782
without being noticed.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.358
You got this?

08:11.458 --> 08:14.027
Don't worry about me.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.030
Yeah?

08:17.130 --> 08:20.433
Client 8 Alpha 10 Whiskey 15 71.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.770
Hold on.

08:25.105 --> 08:28.075
You know, uh,
I could get used to Switch.

08:32.079 --> 08:33.747
Okay.

08:38.586 --> 08:39.920
<i>Sorry, guys.</i>

08:40.020 --> 08:41.221
We asked Kilbride if we
could join you in the field,

08:41.321 --> 08:42.690
but he wants us
to stay put.

08:42.790 --> 08:43.891
Yeah, looks like
you're on your own.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.192
All right, no worries.

08:45.292 --> 08:46.493
We'll continue
to monitor you two.

08:46.594 --> 08:47.227
Let us know if
you need anything.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.029
Copy that.

08:52.566 --> 08:54.201
What are you doing?

08:54.301 --> 08:55.502
We're on overwatch, right?

08:55.603 --> 08:56.770
Right.
That doesn't mean

08:56.870 --> 08:58.572
we have to watch
from this far away.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.273
Why don't we get closer
to Newsome?

09:00.373 --> 09:02.242
That way, you can watch him
while you check out those vans.

09:02.342 --> 09:04.344
What about their roving patrol?

09:04.444 --> 09:05.713
What about them?
I'll distract them.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.547
How are you going to do that?

09:07.648 --> 09:09.717
With bubblegum.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.752
Bubblegum?

09:11.852 --> 09:14.087
Bubblegum.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.462
You know I never
have anything on me.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.398
Not gonna take
your word on that.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.544
You'll get it back
when you leave.

09:46.386 --> 09:47.688
Bryant.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.292
You know the rules.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.762
Always come alone.

09:54.862 --> 09:55.896
Who's this?

09:55.996 --> 09:57.765
Switch.
Switch, huh?

10:00.467 --> 10:01.735
Why you here, Switch?

10:01.835 --> 10:04.471
Because this bitch
owes me money.

10:04.571 --> 10:05.806
Look, I have credits
on the system

10:05.906 --> 10:08.441
and I need my cash out now.

10:10.878 --> 10:11.611
How much?

10:11.712 --> 10:13.080
Hundred and eleven K.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.915
Specific number.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.984
I'm a specific man.

10:30.898 --> 10:33.266
Callen, there
should be an access point

10:33.366 --> 10:35.168
on the northwest
corner of the roof.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.270
It'll drop you into the back
of the storage room.

10:37.370 --> 10:38.706
Yeah, I see it.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.240
Okay, I'm cutting
cell service to the area.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.275
You can communicate using
the sat texting device.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.812
Copy that. Moving.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.998
I need approval to release
her funds in cash,

11:05.098 --> 11:06.433
but I got no signal.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.401
I'll go check her account
on the computer.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.103
Got it.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.049
It's gonna
be a minute.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.484
We need approval
for the cash withdrawal.

11:24.584 --> 11:25.919
I approve it.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.620
It's my money and I need
the cash to pay Switch.

11:27.721 --> 11:28.789
It don't work like that.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.257
I don't care how it works.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.792
I want my money, man.

11:37.597 --> 11:38.498
<i>Bubblegum!</i>

11:38.598 --> 11:40.868
Oh, no!

11:40.968 --> 11:42.302
Oh, no, come on.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.504
Are you in there? Come here.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.106
Come on, little guy.
Come on, buddy.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.707
Hey, get away from the gate.

11:47.808 --> 11:48.776
Bubblegum! Come here,

11:48.876 --> 11:50.643
Bubbles.

11:50.744 --> 11:51.644
You hear me?

11:51.745 --> 11:53.246
Back away right now.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.982
Oh, hi, sir.
I'm so sorry.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.284
I just-- My Burmese,
uh, python, he just...

11:57.384 --> 11:58.852
he slithered under the gate.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.520
So, I just-- I just need
your help, if you could just...

12:00.620 --> 12:03.056
If you could just open this,
that would be really helpful.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.524
That's not happening.

12:04.624 --> 12:05.893
But you don't
understand, all right?

12:05.993 --> 12:07.394
He's gonna probably eat
another coyote,

12:07.494 --> 12:09.162
he's gonna sick
on his fur again,

12:09.262 --> 12:11.098
nobody wants to see that.
What do you want me to do?

12:11.198 --> 12:12.499
Want me to get down on my knees
and beg? That's fine.

12:12.599 --> 12:13.666
I'll get down on
my knees and beg.

12:13.767 --> 12:14.868
All right. That's fine.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.270
Bubblegum! Daddy's here for ya!

12:17.370 --> 12:18.305
Hey, freak boy.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.706
Oh, hey, sorry, hey, sorry.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.641
I'm telling you
to get up and get moving.

12:21.741 --> 12:22.876
Or we're gonna
have a problem.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.177
Okay, here's
the deal, sweetmeat.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.913
Bubblegum has not eaten
in, like, two days.

12:26.013 --> 12:27.447
He's probably hypoglycemic...

12:27.547 --> 12:28.916
Cameras are set.

12:29.016 --> 12:31.118
Okay, great. Hold on, just
searching for the signal...

12:32.419 --> 12:33.553
All right.

12:33.653 --> 12:34.454
We got the camera
feeds, Kensi.

12:34.554 --> 12:35.923
You're good to go.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.825
...if you've got
a cat or a dog

12:37.925 --> 12:39.827
or some sort of platypus in
there, they're gonna be toast.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.394
Okay? Nobody wants
to see that.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.629
I have umbrella insurance,

12:42.729 --> 12:44.031
but it's not gonna
cover a platypus.

12:44.131 --> 12:45.265
FATIMA
Deeks, Kensi's moving.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.699
Just go.
Oh, God.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.268
This is a catastrophic event.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.736
This is ter-- Oh, no!

12:49.837 --> 12:50.871
I see him. There's Bubblegum.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.205
Oh, I'm coming! You, sir.

12:52.305 --> 12:53.306
You, sir?

12:53.406 --> 12:55.208
You are unkind and you are rude

12:55.308 --> 12:56.476
and I bid you good day!

12:56.576 --> 12:57.945
Good day!

12:58.045 --> 12:59.913
Bubblegum, Daddy's
coming for you!

13:00.013 --> 13:01.915
Gonna hold you
tight, baby girl!

13:08.889 --> 13:10.357
Looks like these
weapons originated

13:10.457 --> 13:12.893
from the Argentinian military.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.566
What the hell am I looking at?

13:22.569 --> 13:24.938
One of you better start talking.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.408
Kensi and Deeks
came up with a plan

13:28.508 --> 13:29.877
to check out the vans

13:29.977 --> 13:31.111
while still
maintaining overwatch.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.679
A plan not vetted by me.

13:32.779 --> 13:35.315
Seems like they had a small
window of opportunity, sir.

13:35.415 --> 13:38.651
The weapons appear to be stolen
from the Argentinian military.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.822
Tell Kensi and Deeks
to return to overwatch.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.892
We do not move
to recover the weapons

13:44.992 --> 13:48.061
until we know who the person
running this operation is.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.563
Copy that.
Yes, sir.

13:50.663 --> 13:54.167
Did Callen ever find
that air-gapped computer?

13:54.267 --> 13:56.236
No, sir.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.271
Well, he better hurry up.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.974
We're running out of time.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.321
I am sure that two of you

14:14.421 --> 14:17.124
admire the senior members
of this team.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.826
And there is much to admire.

14:19.927 --> 14:22.629
There is a lot that you
can learn from them, too.

14:22.729 --> 14:23.763
We do, sir.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.398
Don't interrupt me,
I wasn't finished.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.800
Uh, sorry, Admiral.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.202
Where was I?

14:29.302 --> 14:30.637
How much we could learn

14:30.737 --> 14:32.472
from the senior members
of our team. Yes.

14:32.572 --> 14:36.409
But disobeying orders
is not one of those things.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.745
With all due respect, sir,

14:38.845 --> 14:40.713
was what they did
technically disobeying orders?

14:40.813 --> 14:44.851
Absolutely. Kensi and Deeks
were to remain on overwatch.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.886
Now, what the hell
would you call it?

14:48.421 --> 14:50.657
Go on, speak up. There's no
right or wrong answer here.

14:52.092 --> 14:55.062
I would say it's two
agents taking initiative.

14:55.162 --> 14:56.563
Wrong.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.031
You-you just said there
was no wrong answer.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.432
I lied.

15:01.368 --> 15:04.637
Something amusing you'd like
to share with us, Agent Namazi?

15:05.472 --> 15:07.507
Absolutely not, sir, no.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.216
Speak.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.953
Should we meet Kensi and Deeks
in the field?

15:20.053 --> 15:21.288
Just in case?

15:21.388 --> 15:23.256
Okay, yeah.
I'm thinking that's a no.

15:23.356 --> 15:26.226
We're much more
useful here, you know,

15:26.326 --> 15:28.761
supporting both teams.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.297
Good answer.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.266
Alert me to any progress.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.834
Yes, sir.

16:30.723 --> 16:31.691
We good?

16:31.791 --> 16:34.094
Yeah, scanning now.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.295
Got it. Signal's strong,

16:35.395 --> 16:36.863
we have access to the computer.

16:36.963 --> 16:38.798
Copy that.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.370
Any transaction with
ties to Argentina?

16:43.470 --> 16:45.505
Looks like only
the Middle East and Asia.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.474
Oh, but there is one...

16:47.574 --> 16:49.609
Transaction 1189

16:49.709 --> 16:54.047
for $825,000 USD
to a Delfina Fernandez.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.115
All right.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.917
Searching for
the client now.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.287
Maximilian Dana.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.289
Looks like
he's an entrepreneur in L.A.

17:02.389 --> 17:05.625
And he's into gas stations,
dry cleaners and--

17:05.725 --> 17:07.994
And illegal arms dealing.

17:08.095 --> 17:09.229
It's good enough for me.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.897
Give the green light
to both teams to go.

17:10.997 --> 17:13.333
Yes, sir. Callen and Sam,
you're free to extract.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.668
Kensi and Deeks,
secure those weapons.

17:30.683 --> 17:31.584
You three cops?

17:31.684 --> 17:32.952
You trying to set me up, Nina?

17:38.225 --> 17:39.926
Cover me! Cover me!

17:51.271 --> 17:52.505
G.

17:52.605 --> 17:55.041
Clear.

17:55.142 --> 17:56.776
Clear. You good?

17:56.876 --> 17:59.912
Peachy. I told you
we'd make a great team.

18:00.012 --> 18:01.614
You could've told me
you had a gun.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.383
I didn't want to ruin
the surprise.

18:03.483 --> 18:05.051
They patted you down.

18:05.152 --> 18:07.954
Yeah, well, the real gentlemen
never touch the good stuff.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.023
Okay. Good job.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.325
I got to tell ya...

18:12.425 --> 18:14.161
this little baby
has gotten me out of

18:14.261 --> 18:16.729
some very sticky situations.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.065
I call her my Double Dee-fender.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.367
Of course you do.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.770
You're a trip.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.104
Yeah, well, you have no idea.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.273
Oh, I can imagine.

18:26.373 --> 18:28.007
Let's go.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.496
Kensi, do you copy?

18:50.763 --> 18:52.565
Deeks, Kensi's not
responding to comms.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.271
No. No.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.139
Kens, you good?

19:00.240 --> 19:01.408
Yeah. Good.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.042
Your six.

19:11.117 --> 19:12.485
God, I love you.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.187
What's not to love?

19:14.287 --> 19:15.455
Dayum.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.056
Let's go find Newsome.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.459
Yeah, let's go.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.195
Kensi's good.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.964
She's real good.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.468
I've lost contact
with the others.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.403
Who else?

19:30.503 --> 19:32.472
All of them.
No one's responding.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.547
He's a cop. Kill him.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.582
I want him dead!

20:04.904 --> 20:06.606
Did
you get him?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.576
Oh, he got something.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.711
You're not getting out
of here alive.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.581
I was about
to tell you the same thing.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.115
We both can't be right.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.215
Hey.

20:50.216 --> 20:51.984
Tough for me to admit

20:52.084 --> 20:54.153
I needed your help today,
but I did.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.823
Thank you.
It's what we do.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.292
Still rather work alone,

20:59.392 --> 21:02.028
but, uh, you guys ever
need backup, I'm there.

21:02.128 --> 21:03.229
Well...

21:03.330 --> 21:05.298
alone is overrated,
trust me.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.133
At some point in time,
every member of our team

21:07.233 --> 21:09.302
has tried to go lone wolf,
but together...

21:09.402 --> 21:11.137
Forget I said anything.

21:11.237 --> 21:12.572
I'm good by myself.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.240
You sure?

21:14.341 --> 21:15.975
'Cause teamwork makes
the dream work.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.411
I think he's charming.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.580
Oh, it's Callen.
What's he got?

21:20.680 --> 21:24.083
He wants us to meet him
in Beverly Hills tonight.

21:24.183 --> 21:25.852
Okay, well, if we leave now,

21:25.952 --> 21:28.287
we can go catch a little bit
of Rosa's softball game.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.756
Ooh, let's do that.
Hotdogs and popcorn.

21:29.856 --> 21:30.857
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.091
Did you just
"hoo-hoo-hoo"?

21:38.465 --> 21:41.200
Hey. How'd it go?

21:41.300 --> 21:43.336
He said my grades
and professor recommendations

21:43.436 --> 21:44.771
were the best he's ever seen

21:44.871 --> 21:47.006
and definitely the best
he's seen this year.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.541
That's great.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.943
I know it's
the alumni interview

21:51.043 --> 21:52.345
and it's just
a piece of the puzzle,

21:52.445 --> 21:55.382
but if that man has anything
to do with it, I'm in.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.750
I'm happy for you.

21:59.719 --> 22:00.887
What's up with you?

22:00.987 --> 22:02.555
This is the best outcome
we could've hoped for

22:02.655 --> 22:04.424
with this interview and
you're just kind of, like,

22:04.524 --> 22:06.626
oozing negative energy.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.296
Well, I'm not having it.
I'm gonna celebrate my wins--

22:10.397 --> 22:13.299
Our lawyer called
about the LAPD case.

22:14.266 --> 22:15.602
Yeah...

22:16.903 --> 22:18.270
It's good news.

22:18.371 --> 22:20.373
I guess it's just...

22:21.140 --> 22:23.309
It's just what?

22:24.477 --> 22:26.312
There's not gonna be a trial.

22:27.514 --> 22:28.915
What do you mean? How can they--

22:29.015 --> 22:30.517
They offered a settlement.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.386
We don't have to take
the settlement, do we?

22:33.486 --> 22:35.822
Our lawyer thinks we should.

22:37.657 --> 22:39.726
Jordyn, it's a lot of money.

22:39.826 --> 22:42.395
It can pay for
your medical school.

22:43.162 --> 22:46.232
It could even buy us a condo.
Get us out of paying rent.

22:47.299 --> 22:49.502
Wow.
Yeah.

22:49.602 --> 22:52.004
I mean, we don't have
to make a decision today,

22:52.104 --> 22:53.940
but we do have to make one.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.308
I understand.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.079
Maybe the best outcome
of this entire mess

23:00.179 --> 23:03.516
is that we get to change
the trajectory of our family.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.284
W already did that,
with our college degrees.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.787
Yeah, but you
becoming a doctor?

23:07.887 --> 23:09.456
Girl,
that's different.

23:09.556 --> 23:12.492
I know.

23:13.292 --> 23:14.594
Listen...

23:15.462 --> 23:16.963
No matter what we decide,

23:17.063 --> 23:18.831
it's not gonna change
the fact that <i>you</i> did this.

23:18.931 --> 23:22.769
You're the one that put in all
those extra hours after school

23:22.869 --> 23:26.806
to make those grades,
and <i>you</i> aced that interview.

23:29.075 --> 23:32.411
And I'm damn proud to call
you my little sister.

23:33.179 --> 23:34.080
Come here.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.915
Oh.

23:47.293 --> 23:49.395
Don't even think about it.

23:49.496 --> 23:51.297
I'm just trying to help.

23:51.397 --> 23:52.699
No. Not helping.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.467
And put it back.

23:54.567 --> 23:57.136
Here he comes.
I will ask Grisha.

23:57.236 --> 23:58.337
Have you seen this?

23:58.437 --> 23:59.472
Only about a thousand times.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.273
Where do you think I should sit?

24:01.373 --> 24:02.274
Parking lot?

24:02.374 --> 24:03.610
Oh, so funny.

24:03.710 --> 24:04.911
Okay, look.

24:05.011 --> 24:06.378
You want to sit at
a different table,

24:06.479 --> 24:08.915
you bring one date.
One, not two.

24:09.015 --> 24:10.216
I've always been plus-two.

24:11.518 --> 24:12.785
You should
be thankful.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.320
I got you Titan.

24:14.420 --> 24:15.655
I'm not even gonna ask.

24:15.755 --> 24:18.157
He's like the biggest DJ around.

24:18.257 --> 24:20.359
Yeah, and the most expensive.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.460
You cannot
put a price

24:21.561 --> 24:23.963
on artistry and genius.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.665
Actually, I can.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.433
You want people to have fun
at your wedding, don't you?

24:27.534 --> 24:28.901
You want people dancing.

24:29.001 --> 24:29.969
You know, bang...

24:30.069 --> 24:31.170
No. Callen doesn't dance.

24:31.270 --> 24:32.238
I dance.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.106
No, but you shouldn't.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.375
I've seen you, is cry for help.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.577
I think you're confusing me
with Sam.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.979
Can I talk to you outside?
Gladly.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.413
And you--

24:41.514 --> 24:43.315
if you touch anything,

24:43.415 --> 24:45.785
I will cut you, I swear to God.

24:45.885 --> 24:49.421
You remind me of your mother
when you are angry.

24:50.422 --> 24:51.791
And you see what that got her.

24:51.891 --> 24:54.426
Yeah, at least she was smart
enough to cut you loose.

24:54.527 --> 24:56.596
Mm. Sad, but true.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.900
She will always be my minus one.

25:08.174 --> 25:10.677
I'm going to kill him.

25:10.777 --> 25:12.178
Well, if you do, let me know.

25:12.278 --> 25:13.680
That body's too big
for you to move on your own.

25:13.780 --> 25:16.082
Not if I do it in pieces.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.617
Mm.

25:19.418 --> 25:20.887
You still want to do this?

25:22.121 --> 25:25.157
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

25:25.257 --> 25:26.158
Don't you?

25:26.258 --> 25:28.360
Yes.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.396
But not like this.

25:31.397 --> 25:32.765
Look, I... I'm sorry.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.801
I'm sorry. I obviously
never meant for this

25:34.901 --> 25:36.603
to become such a painful ordeal.

25:36.703 --> 25:39.405
It's just that the caterers
aren't returning my calls.

25:39.505 --> 25:41.207
We may or may not have music.

25:41.307 --> 25:42.675
The venue is giving me grief

25:42.775 --> 25:44.611
about added security
and I just...
Oh, hey.

25:44.711 --> 25:46.312
Everything's gonna be okay.

25:46.412 --> 25:47.847
None of that matters.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.082
I mean, not the caterer,
not the DJ,

25:50.182 --> 25:51.951
not Arkady's plus-two.

25:53.452 --> 25:55.121
At the end of the day,

25:55.221 --> 25:57.489
this is about you and me.

25:57.590 --> 26:00.593
And I want to marry you now.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.262
What do you mean, "now"?

26:03.362 --> 26:05.097
I mean <i>now</i> now, like right now.

26:05.197 --> 26:07.700
Right now?

26:11.370 --> 26:12.705
You're serious?

26:16.075 --> 26:17.009
Like today?

26:17.109 --> 26:18.544
Yes.

26:19.445 --> 26:21.147
No.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.281
No, look at me.

26:22.381 --> 26:24.150
You look beautiful.

26:26.619 --> 26:28.254
Okay, where? When?

26:28.354 --> 26:30.857
City Hall. Tonight.

26:32.558 --> 26:34.493
Can I wear my dress?
Absolutely.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.096
I'll borrow a tux from work.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.270
Wait, but what about Arkady
and Sam and--

26:44.370 --> 26:46.372
If you have to tell him, fine.

26:46.472 --> 26:48.641
The rest of them will be there.

26:50.209 --> 26:51.143
Really?

26:51.243 --> 26:53.713
Really.

26:56.548 --> 26:58.017
Uh, the, uh, the only
thing is, I called Stacy,

26:58.117 --> 26:59.051
your maid of honor.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.653
She is out of town on business.

27:02.188 --> 27:03.923
That's okay.

27:04.023 --> 27:06.592
Think I know who
I'd like to stand with me.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.095
Callen, thank you.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.786
<i>Gosh, I cannot
believe that this is happening.</i>

27:33.886 --> 27:36.322
Only Callen and Anna
decide to get married

27:36.422 --> 27:38.124
with two hours' notice.

27:38.224 --> 27:39.458
Which one?
Oh.

27:39.558 --> 27:41.193
Uh, I mean, I like them both.

27:41.293 --> 27:42.862
Um...
I can't decide which.

27:42.962 --> 27:44.130
Uh, the pink one?
Hey, sorry.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.932
Has anyone seen
my pantalones?

27:46.032 --> 27:47.166
Um, that is not a good look.

27:47.266 --> 27:48.300
No, it's not great.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.736
I, uh... I skipped leg day.

27:49.836 --> 27:50.737
Baby. Laundry.

27:50.837 --> 27:51.904
That makes sense, right?

27:52.004 --> 27:52.939
Oh, uh, which one?

27:53.039 --> 27:54.006
Um, they're both fantastic,

27:54.106 --> 27:55.241
but obviously the blue one.

27:55.341 --> 27:56.575
Right? I love the blue.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.177
You guys are not helping.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.645
I'm helping!
Can you please help me

27:59.746 --> 28:00.679
with me my zip... Okay.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.181
Ugh.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.784
Deeks, can you grab that
in the room, please?

28:04.884 --> 28:06.085
Baby,
can you grab that?

28:06.185 --> 28:07.987
Geez.

28:08.087 --> 28:10.322
Yeah, hold on.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.225
Hello, this is Kensi.

28:14.026 --> 28:17.163
Hi. Dr. Cassell, how are you?

28:17.263 --> 28:19.498
Me? Oh, no, I'm so much better,
thank you, yeah.

28:19.598 --> 28:21.133
But I've decided to stay
on that, like...

28:21.233 --> 28:23.335
bland diet, just in case.

28:24.670 --> 28:26.773
I'm sorry, what?

28:28.775 --> 28:30.509
I'm sorry, what?

28:34.981 --> 28:36.148
Um...

28:36.248 --> 28:37.316
Okay, I got pants.

28:37.416 --> 28:38.918
I got pants. I need shoes.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.186
Shoes?

28:40.286 --> 28:41.053
You know where
my shoes are, babe?

28:41.153 --> 28:43.355
What?

28:43.455 --> 28:44.490
Yeah.

28:45.357 --> 28:48.861
Yep. Thank you. Bye.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.764
You okay?

28:54.133 --> 28:55.734
What's going on?

28:57.569 --> 28:58.670
Whoa...

29:02.308 --> 29:04.576
What's going on?
Who was that?

29:04.676 --> 29:06.712
Baby, talk to me.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.616
All right,
you-you-you're scaring me.

29:10.716 --> 29:12.384
Who was on the phone?

29:12.484 --> 29:13.719
Baby?

29:14.720 --> 29:15.855
Are you okay?

29:15.955 --> 29:17.623
Who was that?

29:23.195 --> 29:25.231
We're having a baby.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.537
We're having a baby.

29:31.637 --> 29:33.139
What do you mean
we're having a baby?

29:33.239 --> 29:35.207
We're having a baby.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.576
What do you mean?
H-How is that possible?

29:37.676 --> 29:40.012
We did... We tried everything
and they said...

29:40.112 --> 29:41.580
I know, that
was the doctor,

29:41.680 --> 29:43.749
and, uh, he saw it
in my blood test

29:43.850 --> 29:45.952
and he says that couples
that try and then stop trying

29:46.052 --> 29:49.021
and it happens all the time
and we're having a baby.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.857
We're having a baby.

29:53.559 --> 29:54.927
How are we having a baby?

29:55.027 --> 29:56.495
You're actually...

29:58.464 --> 30:00.967
You mean it wasn't
my shawarma?

30:01.067 --> 30:02.768
I didn't poison you?
Yep.

30:02.869 --> 30:03.769
Wow.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.537
What is going on?

30:07.539 --> 30:09.208
Um...

30:09.308 --> 30:10.776
Uh, the doctor...

30:10.877 --> 30:12.811
Um...

30:14.046 --> 30:16.916
You're gonna be,
uh, a big sister.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.518
Wait, really?

30:20.752 --> 30:22.421
You're pregnant?

30:28.060 --> 30:29.795
Oh, my God...

30:33.232 --> 30:35.301
Okay, but guys,
listen. Um...

30:35.401 --> 30:37.703
This has to be our
secret today. Okay?

30:37.803 --> 30:39.305
Yeah.
Because today is about
Anna and Callen.

30:39.405 --> 30:41.373
Who?

30:41.473 --> 30:43.075
No, no, Anna and Callen,
right, no, this is...

30:43.175 --> 30:44.376
This is our secret.

30:44.476 --> 30:45.912
It's a secret.
I didn't food poison her.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.146
There's a baby in there.

30:47.246 --> 30:49.015
That has nothing to do
with my shawarma.

30:49.115 --> 30:50.182
I'm sorry I was mean.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.350
There is a baby
in her belly.

30:51.450 --> 30:52.651
I was so mean
to you today.

30:52.751 --> 30:54.053
I-I'm gonna call,
just to make sure.

30:54.153 --> 30:55.387
Should I call?

30:55.487 --> 30:56.788
'Cause Dr. Cassell,
he could be wrong.

31:06.899 --> 31:08.567
You good?

31:09.701 --> 31:10.903
I'm great.

31:12.171 --> 31:13.505
Uh...

31:13.605 --> 31:16.208
...thank you
for being my best man.

31:16.308 --> 31:18.410
Honored to do so.
No, I...

31:18.510 --> 31:20.412
I mean it. I mean...

31:20.512 --> 31:24.116
You and I have been through
a lot together over the years.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.918
Hmm.

31:26.018 --> 31:29.255
I would not be here today
if it wasn't for you.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.590
No, you would not.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.326
Aren't you gonna say

31:34.426 --> 31:36.262
you wouldn't be here
without me, either?

31:36.362 --> 31:38.530
Well, I don't want
to lie to you.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.199
Especially on your wedding day.

31:40.299 --> 31:41.467
Really?

31:41.567 --> 31:42.868
I'm having a heartfelt
moment here,

31:42.969 --> 31:44.470
you're just not gonna
let me land it, are you?

31:44.570 --> 31:46.438
I'm just kidding with you.

31:46.538 --> 31:49.008
I wouldn't be here, either.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.343
I love you, man.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.079
I know.

31:53.179 --> 31:54.246
Stop.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.548
I love you, too.

31:56.648 --> 31:57.783
Hey.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.421
Thank you for
always being there.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.656
Hey, thank you.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.493
Okay.

32:08.794 --> 32:10.529
So, uh...

32:11.497 --> 32:12.965
...you done stalling?

32:13.065 --> 32:14.666
Yeah, I think I am.

32:14.766 --> 32:15.567
Okay, good.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.836
Then let's get it on.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.605
Let's do it.

32:42.761 --> 32:44.163
Wow.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.065
Wow, indeed.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.242
Are we ready?

32:56.342 --> 32:57.843
Now or never.

32:57.943 --> 32:58.910
All right, then.

32:59.011 --> 33:01.080
Let's get ready
to rumble.

33:02.914 --> 33:05.284
Friends, family and loved ones.

33:05.384 --> 33:07.286
We are gathered here
today to join

33:07.386 --> 33:09.688
Anastasia Maria Kolcheck

33:09.788 --> 33:12.591
and Grisha Callen
in holy matrimony.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.661
Do you, Anna,
take Grisha

33:15.761 --> 33:18.030
to be your
lawfully wedded husband,

33:18.130 --> 33:21.500
to have and to hold,
for better or worse,

33:21.600 --> 33:24.403
for richer or poorer,
in sickness and in health,

33:24.503 --> 33:26.172
to love and
to cherish,

33:26.272 --> 33:29.808
from this day forward
till death do you part?

33:30.842 --> 33:31.910
I do.

33:35.147 --> 33:36.148
And Grisha...

33:36.248 --> 33:37.583
do you take
Anna to be

33:37.683 --> 33:39.451
your lawfully wedded wife,

33:39.551 --> 33:40.719
to have and to hold,

33:40.819 --> 33:43.255
for better or worse,
for richer or poorer,

33:43.355 --> 33:45.257
in sickness
and in health--

33:45.357 --> 33:46.558
I do.

33:46.658 --> 33:49.528
I actually have
a couple more lines.

33:50.262 --> 33:51.163
Sorry.

33:51.263 --> 33:52.798
My bad.

33:58.704 --> 34:01.006
To love
and to cherish,

34:01.107 --> 34:04.776
from this day forward
till death do us part?

34:05.744 --> 34:06.678
Now?

34:06.778 --> 34:08.614
Now.

34:09.615 --> 34:12.618
I most certainly do.

34:14.186 --> 34:16.455
The rings?

34:21.393 --> 34:24.029
Grisha, you may place the ring
on Anna's finger

34:24.130 --> 34:25.464
and repeat after me.

34:25.564 --> 34:28.167
With this ring, I thee wed.

34:28.267 --> 34:31.403
With this ring, I thee wed.

34:33.139 --> 34:34.940
And Anna...

34:38.377 --> 34:39.445
With this ring,

34:39.545 --> 34:41.547
I thee wed.

34:48.854 --> 34:50.622
Then with
the power vested in me

34:50.722 --> 34:52.624
by the State
of California,

34:52.724 --> 34:54.793
I pronounce you
man and wife.

34:54.893 --> 34:57.363
You may share
your first married kiss.

Don't apologize.

No, well...
No, it's fine.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.763
We have good time now, we drink.
No, it's all me.

35:31.863 --> 35:34.533
And-and if no good
the alcohol is,

35:34.633 --> 35:35.967
you make good cup of coffee.

35:36.067 --> 35:38.437
Oh, thank you.
And we had nice conversation.

35:38.537 --> 35:39.938
And I'm going to miss that.

35:40.038 --> 35:42.441
You don't have to miss anything.
There's always tomorrow.

35:42.541 --> 35:44.276
Wait a minute.
Did you just see that?

35:44.376 --> 35:45.811
I did just see that.

35:45.911 --> 35:47.646
I wish I had not seen that.

35:47.746 --> 35:50.249
I think they make
a cute couple.

35:52.017 --> 35:53.018
What?

35:53.118 --> 35:54.520

Yeah, you and me both.

<i>Neharek mebrouk.</i>

36:29.888 --> 36:31.690

37:17.369 --> 37:19.104
<i>And so have you.</i>

37:21.607 --> 37:23.241
Sorry, man.
I lost him.

37:23.342 --> 37:24.710
Dude just vanished.

37:24.810 --> 37:27.245
Has anyone seen my husband?

37:28.747 --> 37:31.149
What's that?
Uh, it's a letter...

37:31.249 --> 37:32.284
from Hetty.

37:32.384 --> 37:33.852
You're kidding.

37:33.952 --> 37:35.621
Hmm.
Let me guess.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.222
Wedding wishes?

37:37.323 --> 37:38.957
Yeah.

37:40.125 --> 37:41.126
She's amazing.

37:41.226 --> 37:42.160
"P.S.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.962
"I have arranged
for you and Anna

37:44.062 --> 37:46.264
"to have my place in Mykonos
for your honeymoon.

37:46.365 --> 37:48.266
Stay as long as you like."

37:48.367 --> 37:50.268
I've always liked her.

37:54.039 --> 37:55.941
"I have also sent along
two plane tickets

37:56.041 --> 37:57.275
"for you and Sam in the event

37:57.376 --> 38:00.245
"that you may have
a couple days beforehand

38:00.346 --> 38:02.681
to help me
with a small side project."

38:02.781 --> 38:04.816
Side project?

38:06.217 --> 38:07.619
Morocco.

38:11.490 --> 38:14.025
I'll meet you in Greece.

38:14.125 --> 38:14.826
And you...

38:14.926 --> 38:17.696
you keep him alive,

38:17.796 --> 38:19.798
at least until
the honeymoon.

38:20.899 --> 38:23.234
I always do.

38:53.899 --> 38:55.233
Why are you stopping?

38:55.333 --> 38:57.068
Because according
to our GPS,

38:57.168 --> 38:58.937
these are the coordinates.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.712
There's nothing here.

39:06.812 --> 39:08.514
Well, maybe
that's the point.

39:08.614 --> 39:09.781
What do you think
the chances are

39:09.881 --> 39:11.550
one of these guys
has a cold beer?

39:11.650 --> 39:13.752
Yeah, right.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.821
Maybe some mint tea.

39:15.921 --> 39:17.756
I'd rather drink mouthwash.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.691
Hopefully someone out here
speaks French.

39:19.791 --> 39:21.960
You speak Arabic.
No, not Moroccan Arabic.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.795
Darija is like
a whole different language.

39:23.895 --> 39:25.531
Oh. Perfect.

39:25.631 --> 39:28.867
Don't suppose you know the word
for "beer" in Darija, do you?

39:30.001 --> 39:32.804
I didn't think so.

39:40.245 --> 39:41.312
Hetty?

39:43.048 --> 39:46.384
Hello, boys. Welcome to Morocco.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.420
Nell.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.222
What are you doing here?
Well...

39:51.322 --> 39:53.859
let's just say Hetty got
herself into a bit of a pickle,

39:53.959 --> 39:54.993
so I'm here to get her out.

39:55.093 --> 39:57.162
Unfortunately,
it's proven

39:57.262 --> 39:59.330
a little more challenging
than I anticipated,

39:59.431 --> 40:01.467
so I figured my team
could use some help.

40:01.567 --> 40:03.401
You have a team?

40:04.436 --> 40:05.971
Don't tell me
Beale's here with you.

40:06.071 --> 40:09.575
No, sadly, he is giving
a TED Talk in Singapore.

40:09.675 --> 40:11.176
Of course he is.

40:11.276 --> 40:13.845
She brought
in the A-Team.
Oh.

40:14.713 --> 40:16.281
Sabatino.

40:16.381 --> 40:17.616
What's up, big man?

40:17.716 --> 40:18.684
Nate.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.552
Callen. Sam.

40:20.652 --> 40:22.420
Good to see you.

40:22.521 --> 40:23.522
Damn glad you're here.

40:23.622 --> 40:25.056
We're not.

40:25.156 --> 40:27.125
This guy's
bad luck personified.

40:27.225 --> 40:28.794
Oh, you can't hide
your love for me.

40:28.894 --> 40:30.395
Come on, bring it in.

40:30.496 --> 40:31.563
No.

40:31.663 --> 40:34.299
Eh, I think you miss me.

40:35.801 --> 40:37.335
How long you been here, Nate?

40:37.435 --> 40:40.038
Long enough to know we're up
to our asses in alligators.

40:40.138 --> 40:41.907
No real lead
on Hetty's whereabouts,

40:42.007 --> 40:45.076
and the intelligence is...
spotty at best.

40:45.176 --> 40:46.344
And on top of that,

40:46.444 --> 40:48.213
we don't know who we can
and cannot trust.

40:48.313 --> 40:50.148
Which is why
I asked you both here.

40:50.248 --> 40:52.250
Under somewhat
false pretenses.

40:52.350 --> 40:55.721
Eh, subterfuge is the foundation
of good espionage.

40:55.821 --> 40:57.723
You're getting more
like Hetty every day.

40:57.823 --> 41:01.292
I'm gonna take that
as a compliment, thank you.
Mm-hmm.

41:01.392 --> 41:02.794
Who's the kid?

41:02.894 --> 41:04.262
Willis, sir.

41:04.362 --> 41:05.531
No.

41:05.631 --> 41:07.065
No. What did I say?

41:07.165 --> 41:08.767
You're still
the new guy.

41:08.867 --> 41:10.268
That's your name.

41:10.368 --> 41:11.803
Until you prove otherwise,
you're just "New Guy."

41:11.903 --> 41:13.739
I'm the new guy.

41:17.576 --> 41:19.010
Is he always like this?

41:19.110 --> 41:20.512
He's usually worse.

41:20.612 --> 41:22.948
See? They both missed me.

41:23.048 --> 41:24.315
It's sweet. Hmm.

41:27.886 --> 41:29.054
I guess you have a plan?

41:29.154 --> 41:31.189
I'm working on it.

41:31.289 --> 41:32.591
So...

41:32.691 --> 41:33.925
what do you say, gentlemen?
