01:22.440 --> 01:26.194
- You have a loan app? Wonderful.
- Yeah. Terrific.

01:34.400 --> 01:39.474
My wife and I were having dinner
the other night... recently married.

01:46.880 --> 01:49.440
- How can I help you, sir?
- Loretta,

01:49.520 --> 01:54.036
see the man talking
to your bank manager has his case open?

01:54.120 --> 01:56.554
Oh, thas Mr. Gwendon,
one of our assistant managers.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.636
Our manager is Mr. Schoen,
but he's not in today.

01:58.680 --> 02:01.478
- But you see the man with the briefcase.
- Yes.

02:01.560 --> 02:03.755
Thas my partner.
He has a gun in there.

02:03.800 --> 02:07.270
If you don't do exactly
what I tell you or if you give me
any kind of problem at all,

02:07.320 --> 02:11.154
I'm going to look at my partner
and he's going to shoot your
Mr. Gwendon between the eyes.

02:14.920 --> 02:17.275
Okay.

02:17.360 --> 02:22.673
All right, take one of those big
envelopes and put as many 100s,
50s and 20s as you can into it.

02:22.720 --> 02:26.952
Nothing with bank straps
or rubber bands. I don't want
dye packs. I don't want bait money.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.390
Start with the second drawer,
and then the one over there,
under the money counter.

02:33.240 --> 02:37.472
Okay. Is okay. Come on, Loretta.
Key's right next to you.

02:37.560 --> 02:39.391
There you go.

02:44.480 --> 02:47.278
No bills off the bottom
of the drawer, please.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.949
This your first time
being robbed?

02:56.040 --> 02:59.794
You're doing great. Just smile so you
don't look like you're being held up.

03:01.240 --> 03:03.435
You got a very pretty smile.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.869
You got 20s? Give me the 20s.
I'll take those.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.797
There you go.
I'll put those in my pocket.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.751
There you go.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.160
I have to give my partner a sign.
Now, thas good.

03:15.240 --> 03:18.869
He's gonna wait
until I'm out of the building,
make sure you haven't set off the alarm.

03:18.960 --> 03:23.158
If you have, he's gonna shoot your
Mr. Gwendon between the eyes. Okay?

03:23.240 --> 03:26.835
- Okay.
- I think thall do it, Loretta.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.394
Thank you.
Have a nice day.

03:29.480 --> 03:31.630
You too.

03:36.560 --> 03:40.439
Hey... she's cute, isn't she?

03:40.520 --> 03:42.351
Yeah, she seems very nice.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.351
Who was that?

04:17.399 --> 04:19.868
No, no, no, no, no.

04:19.959 --> 04:23.635
Son of a bitch!

04:23.680 --> 04:26.353
Fuck! Fuck!

04:26.440 --> 04:30.353
I think you flooded it.
Get out of the car, sir.

04:30.400 --> 04:34.359
- Hey, you wanna hear a funny story?
- Shut up and get out of the car!

04:34.440 --> 04:38.399
Yeah. Okay.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.719
Go, go, go!

06:08.480 --> 06:10.755
You want somethin', Foley?

06:10.840 --> 06:14.515
Some fellas are goin' out of here.
What if I tell you where and when?

06:14.560 --> 06:17.757
- How many?
- Expect you to look out for me,
let me run off work detail...

06:17.840 --> 06:20.115
Okay, okay.
How many goin' out?

06:20.200 --> 06:22.111
- I hear six.
- When?

06:22.200 --> 06:25.237
- Tonight.
- You know who they are?

06:25.320 --> 06:27.959
Yes, I do.
But I'm not gonna tell you just yet.

06:28.040 --> 06:30.998
Meet me in the chapel,
just before lockdown. Okay?

06:38.520 --> 06:40.397
- You all right?
- I love you, baby.

06:40.440 --> 06:43.159
Tonighs the big night.
You excited?

06:44.840 --> 06:48.799
- Is Super Bowl Sunday, okay?
- See you moved it up.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.838
- Why you think that?
- I saw you runnin' this mornin'.

06:51.920 --> 06:54.309
Stickin' to your routine
in case anybody happened to notice.

06:54.360 --> 06:57.716
But you only did a couple of miles,
instead of your usual five.

06:57.800 --> 07:01.759
Saving yourself for the big event. What
happened? Finish ahead of schedule?

07:01.840 --> 07:04.559
Mira, you see those posts out there?

07:04.600 --> 07:09.230
They're putting up another fence
15 feet back the fence thas
already there, you know?

07:09.280 --> 07:12.556
So you figure, mira,
we wait till Super Bowl Sunday,
they have that fence built...

07:12.600 --> 07:15.592
then, cono, we gotta dig what,
another nine, ten days, baby?

07:15.640 --> 07:17.517
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.

07:17.560 --> 07:22.918
So tonight, when it gets dark,
batta-bing, I'm outta here.
Come on, Foley. You could come.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.470
I appreciate the offer,
and is tempting.

07:26.520 --> 07:29.239
Is a long run to civilization.
Whas it? A hundred miles to Miami?

07:29.280 --> 07:32.511
I'm too old to be tryin'
a stunt like that.

07:32.600 --> 07:35.068
So, you send me a postcard
when you get out.

07:47.160 --> 07:51.517
- Adele Delisi speaking.
- Will you accept a collect call
from Jack Foley?

07:52.600 --> 07:54.477
Yeah, I'll accept.

07:54.520 --> 07:57.432
- Hey, Adele, how you doin'?
- Hey, bank robber.

07:57.520 --> 08:01.911
Want some advice? Next time,
keep the engine running.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.276
- Huh-huh. Thas funny!
- What do you want, Jack?

08:05.360 --> 08:10.480
Adele, you know that Super Bowl party
that was for next Sunday?

08:10.520 --> 08:13.193
They changed the date.
Is tonight at 6:30.

08:13.240 --> 08:17.711
- Didn't you tell me one time
calls aren't monitored?
- I said, not as a rule.

08:17.760 --> 08:20.320
So why don't you just come right out
and tell me what you're talkin' about?

08:20.400 --> 08:23.949
- Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth,
out there in the free world.
- Oh, yeah, whas free about it?

08:24.040 --> 08:26.031
I'm lookin' for work.

08:26.120 --> 08:30.796
- What about Mandrake the Magician?
- Emil, The Amazing, huh?

08:30.840 --> 08:34.753
He fired me.
Hired a younger girl... a redhead.

08:34.840 --> 08:37.876
Adele, the reason I'm calling...
they changed the date.

08:37.919 --> 08:41.390
It is tonight. Is 6:30.
Thas like a few hours from now.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.994
- You tell Buddy...
- Okay, all right, and the guy
driving the other car?

08:44.080 --> 08:48.153
- What are you talking about?
- Well, seeing as you have
so much luck with cars,

08:48.240 --> 08:50.834
Buddy thought it might be
better to bring two, you know?

08:50.920 --> 08:52.990
He got this guy who says
you know him, from Lompoc...

08:53.080 --> 08:55.674
- Uh, Glenn somebody...
- Glenn Michaels.

08:55.760 --> 08:59.469
Uh-huh, thas him. Buddy said
Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.397
- Adele?
- Yeah?

09:01.440 --> 09:05.592
You tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing
his sunglasses, I'm gonna step on 'em.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.717
- Might not even take 'em off first.
- Okay, honey. I'll do that.

09:08.760 --> 09:10.830
Now, you try not to get shot. Bye.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.877
Hey...

09:33.800 --> 09:36.155
Here, ma'am.
Let me help you with these.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.231
Beautiful young lady like you
shouldn't be carrying groceries.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.039
Let a man do that for you.

09:42.520 --> 09:47.036
Now, I didn't ask for your help,
so don't expect a tip.

09:47.120 --> 09:51.750
Oh, thas okay, ma'am.
I'll just take your car.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.036
Happy birthday.

09:54.080 --> 09:56.275
Did you fit another
Chanel suit in here?

09:56.360 --> 09:58.510
Something much better.
Go ahead, open it.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.911
Oh, my God.
Is beautiful.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.633
- Is a, um...
- Sig Sauer 380.

10:11.680 --> 10:16.390
- Right.
- Oh, I love it!

10:16.440 --> 10:18.317
Thanks, Dad.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.430
Happy birthday.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.357
- How 'bout some more coffee?
- You know, I can't.

10:22.440 --> 10:26.831
I have to go out to Glades, and then
I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at 10:00.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.388
Which one is that?
The A.T.F. Guy?

10:29.480 --> 10:32.916
Actually, he's with the F.B.I. Now.
He switched over.

10:32.960 --> 10:37.112
- He's still married, though.
- Technically. They're separated.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.509
- Well, so he's moved out then.
- He's about to.

10:39.600 --> 10:43.479
- Well, then they're
not separated, are they?
- Can we not talk about this?

10:45.400 --> 10:49.029
- What are you doing at Glades?
- Serving process...
a summons and complaint.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.958
Some con doing mandatory life
doesn't like macaroni and cheese.

10:52.040 --> 10:56.591
So, he files suit. Says he doesn't have
any choice in what they serve,

10:56.640 --> 10:58.995
and that violates
his civil rights.

10:59.040 --> 11:04.114
- You can step in, work full-time
as one of my investigators.
- No, thanks.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.395
- You used to like it.
- Dad.

11:06.480 --> 11:10.996
You'd meet doctors, lawyers... nothing
wrong with them, if they're divorced.

11:11.040 --> 11:15.556
Karen, why waste your time
on some cowboy cop...

11:15.640 --> 11:17.517
who drinks too much
and cheats on his wife?

11:17.560 --> 11:20.074
Thas how those hot shots are...
all of 'em!

11:20.120 --> 11:21.997
I really gotta go.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.280
We don't talk much anymore.

11:30.280 --> 11:34.558
How 'bout I come over Sunday
and we watch the Super Bowl together?

11:34.640 --> 11:36.517
I'd like that.

11:37.560 --> 11:39.312
Thanks for the gun, Dad.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.868
They're right underneath you, Pup.
They dug a tunnel.

11:55.960 --> 12:01.353
I don't hear anything.
Where's the tunnel come out?

12:01.400 --> 12:04.119
Fourth post
from the guard tower.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.316
I don't see nothin'.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.237
You just keep watchin'.

12:29.560 --> 12:32.074
Federal Bureau of Investigation,
how may I direct your call?

12:32.120 --> 12:34.554
Yeah, this is Karen Sisco again
for Ray Nicolet.

12:34.640 --> 12:36.631
Hold, please.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.551
Yeah.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.714
The line is busy.
Would you like his voice mail?

13:00.760 --> 13:03.911
No, forget it.
I'll call back later.

13:03.960 --> 13:05.837
- All right.
- Thanks.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.911
Still don't see anything.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.508
You will directly.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.234
Wait a minute.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.797
What the fuck?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.752
Two men by the fence!

14:12.640 --> 14:14.870
What the hell is she doin'?

14:23.560 --> 14:26.028
Stop! Get your hands
in the air!

14:42.440 --> 14:46.353
Tunnel's clear.
Seal up the north face.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.756
- What happened?
- What the hell do you think,
jackass? Got a jail break!

14:49.840 --> 14:53.355
Cubans out in the cane. Don't point
that thing at me. Hey, Buddy.

14:53.400 --> 14:57.393
- Is okay, we're the good guys.
- What are you doing here?

14:57.480 --> 15:01.234
All right. You're just a girl. What do
you do for a living you pack a shotgun?

15:01.280 --> 15:05.910
- I'm a federal marshal
and you're under arrest.
- Thas probably all the hacks.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.275
Why don't we talk
about this later?

15:09.840 --> 15:11.671
Watch your head.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.352
I'm in. Les go!

15:15.160 --> 15:18.835
- Hey! You comfy?
- If I could have a little more room...

15:18.920 --> 15:20.751
Well, there isn't any.

15:20.840 --> 15:23.752
We got a lot of shit in here.
We got handcuffs in here.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.314
Whas in this can?

15:26.360 --> 15:29.193
Thas for your breath. You could
use it... squirt some in your mouth.

15:29.240 --> 15:31.151
Yeah, well, thas mace, isn't it?

15:37.600 --> 15:40.512
All right, you! Get...

15:42.520 --> 15:46.195
Hey. Where's your gun... pistol?

15:46.240 --> 15:49.198
In my bag, in the car.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.037
Boy, it stunk in there.

16:01.080 --> 16:04.709
I believe it. You're ruining
a $900 suit my dad gave me.

16:04.760 --> 16:07.228
Yeah, it went great
with that 12-gauge too.

16:07.320 --> 16:09.470
Why in the world would someone like you
become a federal marshal?

16:09.560 --> 16:12.438
- The idea of going after
guys like you appealed to me.
- Sorry, what was that?

16:12.520 --> 16:14.556
Guys like me?
Let me tell you something.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.712
Even though I've been celibate lately,
I'm not going to force myself on you.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.314
- I've never done that in my life.
- You wouldn't have time, anyway.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.631
We come to a roadblock, they run the car
and find out who it belongs to.

16:23.720 --> 16:26.871
Thas if they get set up in time,
which I doubt. If they do,

16:26.960 --> 16:30.794
they'll be lookin' for a bunch
of little Latin fellas, not
a big black guy drivin' a Ford.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.877
He must be quite a pal,
to risk his own ass like this.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.876
Buddy? Yeah, he's a good guy.

16:35.960 --> 16:40.954
Back when we jailed together,
he used to call his sister
every week, without fail.

16:41.040 --> 16:44.589
She's a born-again Christian. She does
bookkeeping for a televangelist.

16:44.680 --> 16:46.511
He'd call her up,
confess his sins.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.750
He'd tell her whatever bank
he happened to rob at the time.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.831
Buddy... that
his given name?

16:50.920 --> 16:53.229
The one I gave him, yeah.

16:53.320 --> 16:56.437
So, whas your name?

16:56.520 --> 16:58.829
Be in the paper
tomorrow, anyway.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.997
Jack Foley.
You've probably heard of me.

17:02.040 --> 17:05.156
- Why? Are you famous?
- The time I was convicted in California,

17:05.240 --> 17:09.950
the F.B.I. Told me that I'd robbed
more banks than anybody in the computer.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.599
- How many was that?
- Tell you the truth,
I don't really know.

17:12.640 --> 17:17.839
Started when I was 18 years old,
driving for my Uncle Cully,
and his partner, Gus.

17:17.880 --> 17:22.317
So, basically you're saying
you spent half your life in prison.

17:22.359 --> 17:24.920
Basically, yeah.
I go back, I do 30 years. No time off.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.835
- You imagine lookin' at that?
- I don't have to. I don't rob banks.

17:32.360 --> 17:34.191
You don't seem all that scared.

17:34.280 --> 17:37.875
- Of course I am.
- You don't act like it.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.797
What do you want me
to do, scream?

17:39.840 --> 17:41.876
That wouldn't help much, anyway.

17:41.920 --> 17:47.358
No, I'm just gonna sit here, take it
easy, and wait for you to screw up.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.715
You sound like my ex-wife.

17:49.760 --> 17:54.038
- You were married?
- Just for about a year,
give or take a few days.

17:54.120 --> 17:56.873
Is not like we didn't get along...
we had fun. We just...

17:56.920 --> 18:00.390
didn't have... that thing,
you know, that uh...

18:00.440 --> 18:05.036
- That spark, you know?
Gotta have that.
- Mm-hmm.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.310
- We still talk, though.
- Sure.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.594
This is not gonna end well.
These things never do.

18:12.640 --> 18:15.313
If it turns out I get shot
like a dog, is gonna be in the street,

18:15.400 --> 18:17.391
not off a goddamn fence.

18:17.440 --> 18:20.955
You must really see yourself
as some kind of Clyde Barrow, huh?

18:25.360 --> 18:28.113
- You mean, of Bonnie and Clyde?
- Yeah.

18:31.680 --> 18:35.275
The part in the movie where they get
shot, when is Warren Beatty and...

18:35.320 --> 18:37.754
- Faye Dunaway.
- Faye Dunaway, yeah.

18:37.840 --> 18:41.913
- I like her in that movie about TV.
- Network, yeah, she was good.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.958
And that guy says he's not gonna
take any more shit from anybody.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.508
- Peter Finch.
- Yeah! Peter Finch.

18:47.600 --> 18:51.479
"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not
gonna take any more of your shit!"

18:53.840 --> 18:56.070
In that part where they get shot,
I can remember thinkin' to myself,

18:56.120 --> 19:01.114
thinkin', "Hey, that wouldn't be
such a bad way to go, if you had to."

19:20.520 --> 19:22.351
You sure are easy to talk to.

19:26.280 --> 19:30.956
I was thinkin', if we met
under different circumstances...

19:31.000 --> 19:34.515
if you were in a bar and
I came up and we started talkin'...

19:34.560 --> 19:37.028
- I wonder what would happen.
- Nothing.

19:37.080 --> 19:40.117
- If you didn't know who I was.
- You'd probably tell me.

19:40.160 --> 19:43.232
- Just saying if we met
under different circumstances...
- You have got to be kidding.

19:43.320 --> 19:46.153
Yeah. Yeah.

19:46.200 --> 19:50.876
Another movie I liked with Faye Dunaway
was Three Days of the Condor.

19:50.960 --> 19:53.520
The one with Robert Redford
when he was young.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.437
Yeah.

19:57.480 --> 20:00.517
You know, I never thought
it made sense, though...

20:00.600 --> 20:03.478
you know, the way
they got together so quick.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.397
Why not?

20:05.440 --> 20:07.635
- I mean, romantically.
- Mm-hmm.

20:10.520 --> 20:14.035
Well, but it... if... uh.
All right.

20:14.560 --> 20:17.074
Here we go. All right.
Where the hell are we?

20:17.120 --> 20:19.031
At the turnpike. Glenn's right above us
with the other car.

20:19.120 --> 20:21.998
- All right, c'mon. Hop on out.
- Turn around and get your hands up!

20:22.040 --> 20:24.031
Shit!

20:24.120 --> 20:26.236
We may as well leave her.
We're leavin' the car...

20:26.320 --> 20:27.992
and we gotta leave her someplace,
anyway... whas the difference where?

20:28.080 --> 20:30.833
- She's comin' with us.
- Jesus Christ, what were
you doing in there?

20:30.920 --> 20:33.673
- Look for a name.
- I already looked.

20:33.720 --> 20:36.917
Her name is Karen Sisco. Like
the Cisco Kid, only spelled different.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.996
S-l-S-C-O.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.311
Karen?

20:45.400 --> 20:48.472
All right, Karen?
You be a good girl, now.

20:48.560 --> 20:50.516
I'm gonna open up the trunk.

20:50.560 --> 20:54.678
Hey, hey, hey, now!
Now, you're puttin' holes in your car!

20:54.720 --> 21:00.317
I'm not leavin' you.
I'm gonna open the trunk enough
for you to drop your pistol out.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.870
Now, if you shoot, Buddy's got
your shotgun, he's gonna shoot back.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.679
There's nothin' I can do about it,
so is up to you.

21:06.760 --> 21:11.470
Hey. Don't!
Is Glenn! Whoa!

21:11.560 --> 21:14.870
Fuck! Hey, hey, Jack.
Good to see you, man.

21:14.960 --> 21:18.191
What the fuck
are you guys shooting at?

21:18.240 --> 21:20.356
- Do we need 'im?
- The cop saw this car.

21:20.440 --> 21:23.273
- He might tie it to the break
and turn around.
- All right.

21:23.320 --> 21:27.677
- Hey, Studs. We didn't recognize ya.
- Hey, "Studs," man.

21:27.760 --> 21:32.629
I haven't heard that since Lompoc, man.
So whas goin' on?

21:33.920 --> 21:35.797
Aw, nothin'.

21:36.800 --> 21:40.634
Karen. Are you comin' out?

21:43.800 --> 21:46.394
- You hear that?
- Okay!

21:47.640 --> 21:49.517
Okay.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.277
You win, Jack.

22:09.720 --> 22:12.154
Now, you get your clothes cleaned,
you send me the bill.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.117
I'll send it to you at Glades.

22:14.200 --> 22:17.397
What, did you crawl through
a sewer, man? Who're you?

22:17.440 --> 22:20.716
- Take your sunglasses off.
- I see better with 'em on, man.

22:20.760 --> 22:22.955
You don't take 'em off
I'm gonna throw them off
while they're still on your head.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.949
- Go wait in the car.
- Um, we're in civilization now,
so you can ease up a little bit.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.073
I'm sorry. I'd like you
to wait in the car, please.
Take her, put her in the back.

22:32.120 --> 22:35.908
- Okay. In the trunk?
- In the backseat! In the backseat!

22:35.960 --> 22:39.191
- Backseat. Okay, you gotta come now,
'cause I gotta do this...
- Gimme your jacket.

22:39.280 --> 22:41.555
Somebody forgot
to bring the clean clothes.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.591
I brought 'em. They're at Glades
in the back of the Cadillac.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.870
You decided to jump
into the trunk of her car.

22:45.960 --> 22:48.394
You can blame me if you want.
I don't mind.

22:48.440 --> 22:51.955
- Here, sir.
- I'll tell you...

22:52.000 --> 22:54.468
- Whas your problem, Jack?
- I don't know why you got Glenn
involved in this.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.750
- How 'bout the score was
his idea to begin with?
- Idea...

22:56.840 --> 22:58.831
The guy's got a fuckin'
vacant lot for a head.

22:58.880 --> 23:02.668
He thinks he can talk
to me like that? Shit.

23:02.720 --> 23:07.475
"Gimme your jacket." I have been
sitting here for over a half-hour,

23:07.520 --> 23:11.149
watchin' out for the Highway Patrol,
if you think thas fun.

23:11.240 --> 23:14.550
God. You know, I hadda go
over there in the bushes...

23:14.640 --> 23:18.792
to smoke a joint, just so I could like...
you know?

23:18.840 --> 23:23.470
Yep. I got somethin'
big lined up, up north.

23:23.520 --> 23:27.672
Yeah, these guys? Wouldn't even fuckin'
know about it if it wasn't for me.

23:27.760 --> 23:31.070
- Every time he opens his mouth,
I wanna punch him out.
- He's not the problem, Jack.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.993
You wanna pull your head
outta your ass, tell me why the hell
we're bringing her with us?

23:34.040 --> 23:36.190
Glenn.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.475
You don't remember me, do you?

23:40.400 --> 23:44.916
Um, couldn't have been Glades
if thas what you're thinkin',
'cause I was never out there.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.629
- No, thas not what I'm thinking.
- Oh, yeah?

23:48.720 --> 23:52.076
But you're sure
we've met, huh?

23:52.120 --> 23:53.758
Last fall.

23:53.840 --> 23:58.675
I drove you from the Palm Beach County
Jail to the federal courthouse... twice.

23:58.760 --> 24:00.990
You're Glenn Michaels.

24:01.080 --> 24:03.674
I never forget anybody
I've cuffed and shackled.

24:03.760 --> 24:06.354
Now les think about this for a minute,
Glenn, see if we can't work it out.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.915
Do we have a gun in the car?

24:10.000 --> 24:12.719
Oh, shit!
I remember you! Hey!

24:12.760 --> 24:15.957
Foley's not gonna make it,
and if he goes down, you go with him.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.719
- Now, look. I can understand
if you guys are close, but...
- No, we're not.

24:18.800 --> 24:23.794
- But, yeah. I'm helpin' him.
- Now wait a minute, Glenn.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.711
Have you helped him?

24:25.800 --> 24:29.793
I mean, technically,
at this point, I doubt you could be
charged with aiding a fugitive.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.757
So you still have a choice.

24:31.800 --> 24:35.634
You wanna take her to my place, get
cleaned up, come out of the bathroom...

24:35.720 --> 24:38.678
with your aftershave on, and she goes,
"Oh. I had you all wrong."

24:38.760 --> 24:40.591
No. I just wanna talk
to her again, thas all.

24:40.680 --> 24:44.309
I just wanna see what it might have
been like under normal circumstances.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.709
Is too late for that, Jack.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.916
He wants to get out of here,
and I don't blame him.

25:26.280 --> 25:30.068
Ref don't call it soon, Snoop's gonna
send this cat out in a body bag.

25:31.480 --> 25:34.074
Anybody ever tell you
why they call him "Snoopy"?

25:36.200 --> 25:38.668
He used to be
Maurice "Mad Dog" Miller...

25:38.720 --> 25:41.075
back when he was a pro.

25:42.680 --> 25:44.591
Now you pet him,
he goes down.

25:50.560 --> 25:53.393
- I don't believe it!
- Oh, my!

25:57.720 --> 26:00.439
Bullshit! Bullshit!

26:03.640 --> 26:05.710
Yeah, you the man.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.750
Guy's bragging he won
a thrown fight.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.677
Fuckin' pathetic.

26:18.360 --> 26:20.191
Dangerous is what it is.

26:23.720 --> 26:26.996
- Who's the bald dude?
- Richard Ripley.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.389
The Wall Street guy?

26:29.480 --> 26:32.119
Call him Dick The Ripper on account
of all the guys he ripped off.

26:32.160 --> 26:35.277
Oh, yeah. I didn't
recognize him without his rug.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.276
- Whas his bid?
- Three years.

26:37.360 --> 26:40.272
You guys on the bench? Okay.

26:40.360 --> 26:44.273
Three years, fined $50 million
and wrote 'em a fuckin' check.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.197
Just like that.

26:46.280 --> 26:48.840
Fifty mill, signed his name.

26:48.920 --> 26:51.878
Didn't even... Didn't even...
Okay, a little help.

26:51.960 --> 26:53.712
Okay, heavy!

26:53.760 --> 26:55.637
Heavy! Come on!

26:59.160 --> 27:02.869
All the bright glare out here,
you couldn't read the numbers
on the weights.

27:02.960 --> 27:05.713
Oh. I had it. Jesus.

27:05.760 --> 27:09.389
- How do you know he wrote a check?
- Uh, he told me.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.954
We work laundry together.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.195
Guy loves to fucking talk.

27:14.240 --> 27:17.312
Yeah, he loves to talk.
He talked to the U.S. Attorney.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.789
Rolled over on all the snitches
he was doing business with.

27:19.880 --> 27:24.112
Hey! Any guy who can write
a fuckin' check for $50 million,

27:24.160 --> 27:27.630
he says anything,
I'm all fuckin' ears.

27:27.680 --> 27:31.468
Guy tells me he's got
all this money in foreign banks.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.829
Plus, around, mmm,

27:33.880 --> 27:37.589
five million in uncut diamonds
at his house.

27:37.680 --> 27:39.511
He said, quote,

27:39.600 --> 27:42.353
that I can get my hands on it
at any time.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.550
- Where does he live?
- Detroit.

27:44.600 --> 27:49.549
Snoopy Miller says that uncut diamonds
are as easy to move as cash.

27:51.960 --> 27:54.190
Ever seen
an uncut diamond, Studs?

27:54.280 --> 27:56.953
Looks just like
a plain, old rock.

27:57.040 --> 28:00.919
Wait, you think this guy's lying?

28:03.160 --> 28:06.391
What do you think, Studs? Use
your head. Some guy's got $5 million...

28:06.480 --> 28:10.917
socked away in his house,
and he's gonna tell some motormouth
he just met in prison about it.

28:12.280 --> 28:14.669
Oh, I see.
You guys are cynical. Right.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.031
Here it comes.

28:40.120 --> 28:42.839
Keep on walking. Keep walking.

28:42.880 --> 28:45.189
You don't wanna be
answering any questions.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.675
I'm just saying
she wasn't scared, thas all.

28:54.760 --> 28:57.877
Thas 'cause she had
her hand on her gun the whole time
waitin' to make her move.

28:57.960 --> 29:00.679
You're just jealous 'cause
it was me in the trunk with her...

29:00.760 --> 29:02.591
- and not you.
- You're right.

29:02.680 --> 29:06.309
The first thing I'm gonna do...
is get this mud off me.

30:36.280 --> 30:38.236
Hey.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.956
Karen?

31:09.160 --> 31:10.229
Karen, honey?

31:10.320 --> 31:13.471
Karen?

31:13.560 --> 31:15.790
You were talking
in your sleep.

31:20.440 --> 31:22.510
Whad I say?

31:22.600 --> 31:24.431
"Hey, yourself."

31:26.360 --> 31:29.238
Huh.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.709
Hello, Daniel.

31:36.800 --> 31:41.078
Daniel Burdon, F.B.I.

31:41.120 --> 31:43.429
Marshall Sisco, Karen's dad.

31:43.480 --> 31:45.357
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.277
Umm...

31:47.320 --> 31:50.357
Would you mind, please,
waiting outside?

31:50.400 --> 31:52.436
We have some business
to do here.

31:54.640 --> 31:56.915
Well, uh, I have
to use the john anyway.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.837
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

32:03.520 --> 32:06.512
I wanna be
on the task force, Daniel.

32:06.600 --> 32:08.795
Well...

32:08.880 --> 32:13.192
Thas nice of you
to offer, Karen, but...

32:13.240 --> 32:17.153
I got all the help
I can use right now.

32:17.240 --> 32:21.518
Instead, les talk about
how you got that bump on your head.

32:21.560 --> 32:23.949
Isn't that my file
you're holding on to?

32:24.000 --> 32:27.072
Yes, but I want
to hear it from you,

32:27.160 --> 32:30.516
starting... with when
you grabbed the wheel.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.319
Where was this?

32:33.400 --> 32:35.231
Coming to the Okeechobee exit.

32:35.320 --> 32:38.357
- Sit back!
- Can you see with those glasses on?

32:38.400 --> 32:41.073
I'm fine!
This is... stupid, man.

32:41.120 --> 32:43.475
These guys are gonna be
so disappointed in me, man.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.750
You know what?
If I wasn't stoned,

32:45.840 --> 32:48.673
there is no way that you would have
talked me into this.

32:48.760 --> 32:51.479
- Remember that.
- Get off at the exit
right after that bridge.

32:51.520 --> 32:54.956
No, I am not fucking turning
myself in, so forget it!

32:55.000 --> 32:57.036
- Get off at that exit!
- What exit?

32:57.080 --> 32:59.389
- That exit right there. Take that exit!
- Sit back! No!

33:06.840 --> 33:08.876
The next thing I knew,

33:08.920 --> 33:12.196
the paramedics were
pulling me out of the car.

33:12.280 --> 33:14.999
- You all right?
- There's a couple
of points I keep wondering about...

33:15.040 --> 33:17.110
have to do with the two guys
that grabbed you.

33:17.200 --> 33:21.079
Buddy, is it?
And this fella Jack Foley.

33:21.160 --> 33:24.675
I swear, the man must have robbed
over 200 banks in his time.

33:24.760 --> 33:26.591
- Really?
- Um-hmm.

33:26.680 --> 33:28.830
He told me he didn't
remember how many he robbed.

33:28.920 --> 33:31.309
Then you talked to him.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.675
In the trunk, yeah.

33:33.720 --> 33:36.154
Whad you talk about?

33:36.240 --> 33:38.196
Different things.

33:38.240 --> 33:40.993
Prison, movies.

33:41.080 --> 33:45.551
This fella holds you hostage,
you talk about movies?

33:47.760 --> 33:50.479
It was an unusual experience.

33:50.520 --> 33:53.398
You know, Foley made me think
of that fella Carl Tillman.

33:53.440 --> 33:56.910
The one that you were seeing,
it turns out, the same time
he was robbing banks.

33:56.960 --> 33:59.315
- Do you recall that?
- And what happened to Carl?

33:59.360 --> 34:03.148
The time came, you shot him. But you
didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.

34:03.200 --> 34:07.591
They're unarmed, you had a shotgun
and you let them throw you in the trunk.

34:07.640 --> 34:09.949
Okay. Now you got
your Sig in your hand,

34:10.040 --> 34:12.315
and you say in the report
that you couldn't turn around.

34:12.400 --> 34:15.551
He had you pinned down.
But when the trunk opened,

34:15.639 --> 34:18.199
how come you didn't
cap the two guys then?

34:18.280 --> 34:21.511
What do you work on most of the time?
Fraud? Go after crooked bookkeepers?

34:21.560 --> 34:25.951
Karen, I've been with the bureau
15 years on all kinds of investigations.

34:26.040 --> 34:28.838
- Have you ever shot a man?
- No.

34:28.920 --> 34:32.230
- When was the last time you were
primary through the door?
- I have to qualify?

34:32.320 --> 34:34.197
You have to know
what you're talking about.

34:38.840 --> 34:41.400
We'll talk another time.
All right, Karen?

34:44.120 --> 34:47.635
I'd like to know why Foley
put you in that second car
when he didn't need you anymore.

34:50.520 --> 34:51.839
You'll have to ask him that.

35:07.320 --> 35:09.231
Rip, Rip.

35:09.280 --> 35:12.158
- What the deal is, baby?
- Hi, Maurice.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.595
- Oops. I don't know.
- Make a fist...

35:14.680 --> 35:17.069
- There you go.
- Fuck it, man.

35:17.120 --> 35:19.236
- Got your little fishies for you.
- Oh, good.

35:19.320 --> 35:24.269
Not so fast. Starting out,
there's gonna be an across the board
cost of living increase.

35:24.360 --> 35:27.750
- What?
- When I got put in here a year ago
on credit card fraud,

35:27.800 --> 35:29.677
I didn't really get
no props for that.

35:29.720 --> 35:33.349
But ever since I shanked
that loudmouth pussy in the yard,

35:33.400 --> 35:37.712
is like my Dun and Broadstreet around
this bitch done shot way the fuck up.

35:37.800 --> 35:41.588
Actually, is Dun and Bradstreet.
Thas the, uh...

35:41.680 --> 35:43.875
Well, I've heard it both ways.

35:43.960 --> 35:46.428
Point is that the price
has gone up around this bitch too.

35:46.520 --> 35:49.353
Get your little black book out.
We got some business to talk about.

35:51.800 --> 35:54.439
For the little fishies...
Whad I say they was gonna be?

35:54.520 --> 35:57.512
- Two thousand.
- Now they're gonna be three thousand.

35:57.560 --> 36:00.438
- Come on. You...
- Now they're gonna be three thousand.

36:02.440 --> 36:04.749
That saltwater shit
you put in your eyes?

36:04.800 --> 36:07.519
- What do you call that?
- Bausch & Lomb.

36:07.600 --> 36:10.558
Yeah, that bushy lawn shit.
Thas 300.

36:10.640 --> 36:13.791
- I need it.
- Yeah, you do. And that extra pillow.

36:13.880 --> 36:16.917
I'm gonna get that for you,
but thas gonna be like five C's.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.831
- Five?
- Hey.

36:18.920 --> 36:22.196
Sign says shut the fuck up,
or can't you fellas read?

36:22.280 --> 36:24.350
Who the fuck
you talkin' to, man?

36:25.600 --> 36:27.795
You got a problem
over there, Foley?

36:27.880 --> 36:32.795
Yeah, this is
the dumbest fucking shakedown
in the history of dumb shakedowns.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.075
- Five hundred bucks for a pillow?
- Thas right.

36:35.160 --> 36:38.152
- It does seem a little high,
doesn't it?
- Shut up, Dick.

36:38.200 --> 36:40.270
- Must be a nice pillow.
- Full goose down.

36:40.320 --> 36:43.153
- Look, you still...
- How much for your company at chow?

36:43.200 --> 36:46.351
My company? Come on, man. You know
I'll watch this motherfucker's back.

36:46.440 --> 36:49.000
- How much?
- Thas a C-note.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.879
If you're smart, Ripley,
you'll tell this guy to fuck off.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.797
Really?

36:55.840 --> 36:58.354
Well, l... l...
I don't know.

36:58.440 --> 37:01.637
First of all, if he kills you,
then he's gonna get nothin'.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.917
Well, uh, the man don't
just have to die, Foley.

37:04.960 --> 37:08.839
He could accidentally hurt himself
falling down on something real hard.

37:08.920 --> 37:12.595
Like a shiv or my dick.

37:12.680 --> 37:15.240
I'll pay. I'll pay it.
Don't worry.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.550
If he falls on anything, Snoop,

37:17.640 --> 37:21.235
then they're gonna transfer
his ass outta here faster
than you can throw a fight...

37:21.320 --> 37:23.470
and you're still
gonna get nothin'.

37:23.520 --> 37:25.988
You know, last time I checked, man,

37:26.040 --> 37:28.395
this shit over here ain't
got nothin' to do with you.

37:28.440 --> 37:31.113
Why don't you go outside?
Smoke a cigarette or some shit.

37:31.160 --> 37:33.355
I don't smoke.

37:33.400 --> 37:36.073
You heard the man. Why don't
you get your punk ass up outta here?

37:36.120 --> 37:39.590
- Uh-oh.
- You fucked up now, man. Thas Himey.

37:39.640 --> 37:42.996
Protege of mine. Ranked number 32
in the federal prison system.

37:43.080 --> 37:44.911
- Thirty-two?
- Thas right.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.468
- Out of, what, 20.
- Kick this cracker's ass.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.996
- Whas going on here?
- Uh, nothin'.

37:57.080 --> 38:00.550
Just "reading is fundamental" shit.
We got all excited and everything.

38:00.600 --> 38:02.511
Clear outta here. Now.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.835
- No problem.
- All of you. Les go.

38:07.800 --> 38:11.554
Uh, Snoopy.
I think we settled the fish thing.

38:11.640 --> 38:13.471
Oh, the fish. Yeah.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.349
Thas how you
do the shake, partner.

38:31.880 --> 38:34.997
Paper says there's ten grand each
on you, Chino and Lulu.

38:35.040 --> 38:36.917
They say anything about Karen?

38:36.960 --> 38:38.837
Just that she got away. Here.

38:38.880 --> 38:40.836
- Hmm?
- Jack!

38:40.920 --> 38:42.751
- Hey!
- Thas all right. Is in the pool.

38:42.840 --> 38:45.752
Did it say what happened to her
after she took off with Glenn?

38:45.840 --> 38:47.671
I don't know.
You'll have to ask Glenn.

38:47.760 --> 38:50.320
He's probably on his way to Detroit,
which is where we should be.

38:50.360 --> 38:53.238
- Yeah.
- Do you realize what you're doing?

38:53.320 --> 38:55.629
Worrying about a woman
who works for law enforcement?

38:55.680 --> 38:59.116
You wanna sit down and have cocktails
with a woman who tried to shoot you.

38:59.160 --> 39:02.277
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Do you think this old guy's
her boyfriend?

39:02.360 --> 39:04.191
Is the only picture
she has in here.

39:04.280 --> 39:06.589
Am I going to Detroit by myself?

39:06.680 --> 39:08.750
The longer we stay here,
the better chance there is...

39:08.840 --> 39:10.671
that either Glenn
is gonna screw up the score,

39:10.760 --> 39:13.718
or we gonna get busted or both.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.757
This is Foley?

39:19.800 --> 39:22.109
- Karen?
- Hmm?

39:22.200 --> 39:26.159
- This is Foley?
- How lucky can one guy be

39:26.200 --> 39:29.192
Doesn't even look like that.

39:29.240 --> 39:32.915
- Oh, no?
- Uh-uh. He looks a lot like...

39:35.280 --> 39:37.111
Different.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.589
Wyatt Earp is here.

39:51.080 --> 39:52.911
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.309
- How you feelin'? Feel better?
- Good. Yeah.

39:55.400 --> 39:58.233
- Is your dad taking good care of you?
- He took the week off...

39:58.320 --> 40:01.710
to take care of me and he's worked on
his boat every day since.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.995
- Dad, this is Ray Nicolet.
- Hi.

40:04.080 --> 40:07.311
- Pleasure to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.
- Likewise.

40:07.360 --> 40:10.636
Ray's working with the F.B.I.
Task force on the prison break.

40:10.680 --> 40:14.389
I see that. Tell me, Ray, do you ever
wear one that says "undercover"?

40:16.960 --> 40:19.394
- No.
- How's it going?

40:19.480 --> 40:21.311
Sit down.

40:21.400 --> 40:24.756
Okay. Good.
We caught one of them.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.757
- Was it Foley?
- Was it off a tip?

40:26.840 --> 40:30.196
Somebody spotted two of them
out in this hobo camp near the airport.

40:30.240 --> 40:32.276
Called in the number.
That was it.

40:32.360 --> 40:35.158
- I knew it as soon
as I as there was a reward.
- Was it Foley?

40:35.240 --> 40:38.118
No, Linares,
one of the Cubans.

40:38.200 --> 40:41.510
We went in there with full SWAT,
two choppers, that whole deal.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.915
Linares goes nuts, starts shooting,
so we took him out.

40:43.960 --> 40:46.793
I don't know how Chirino
got away, but he did.

40:46.840 --> 40:49.718
- And Foley hadn't been there.
- No, this place was strictly Cuban.

40:49.800 --> 40:53.839
Foley had a ride. He must have
his own agenda. You know what I mean?

40:53.880 --> 40:57.077
He seems to be the only guy
who kinda knows what he's doing.

40:57.160 --> 40:58.991
Uh-huh.

40:59.080 --> 41:01.594
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

41:01.680 --> 41:03.591
Hello?

41:03.640 --> 41:06.200
Yeah, she is.
Just a minute, please.

41:06.280 --> 41:08.111
Karen.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.873
- Hello?
- Hi.

41:12.280 --> 41:15.670
You know who this is?

41:15.760 --> 41:18.877
Yes.
Five minutes.

41:25.320 --> 41:27.151
So. Ray.

41:27.240 --> 41:29.834
- Yeah.
- There's something I'm wondering.

41:29.880 --> 41:33.589
The headline reads, "I slept with
a murderer, says shaken Miami woman."

41:33.760 --> 41:36.718
- Who is it that answered the phone?
- None of your business.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.558
I'm just worried maybe
I'm not old enough for you.

41:39.640 --> 41:42.950
- It was my dad.
- Really?

41:43.000 --> 41:46.834
- He's got a cop's face.
- How do you know?

41:46.920 --> 41:50.515
- Oh, wait. You have my wallet.
- And your gun.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.875
- Think I can have 'em back?
- How do we do that?

41:52.920 --> 41:55.753
You can come by my daďs place
and drop 'em off.

41:55.800 --> 41:58.519
I could leave it with the SWAT guy
that answers the door.

41:58.600 --> 42:01.239
There's a guy here
on the task force right now.

42:01.280 --> 42:03.714
Maybe I should put him on the phone
and let the two of you work it out.

42:03.800 --> 42:05.870
- You wouldn't do that.
- Why not?

42:05.960 --> 42:09.396
Because you're having
too much fun.

42:09.480 --> 42:11.311
She fixes him pork chops and rice.

42:11.400 --> 42:14.039
The next thing you know,
they're making love on the sofa.

42:14.120 --> 42:16.031
She says he was very gentle.

42:16.120 --> 42:19.715
This guy, Chirino, shows up at the
house, says he misses his little girl.

42:19.800 --> 42:23.270
She feels sorry for him.
Next thing you know... boom.

42:23.320 --> 42:26.232
- On the couch.
- Thas how you score now, huh?

42:27.720 --> 42:29.551
I guess.

42:29.640 --> 42:31.631
There's something
I've been wondering.

42:31.680 --> 42:33.716
Whatever happened
to your Uncle Cully?

42:33.760 --> 42:36.035
You think he's gonna
tell you where I am?

42:36.120 --> 42:38.839
- Unless you wanna tell me.
- He's dead.

42:38.880 --> 42:40.757
Did 27 years before he got out,

42:40.800 --> 42:43.792
and he died a couple of years afterwards
in a charity hospital...

42:43.840 --> 42:46.513
by trying to make up
for all the good times he missed.

42:46.600 --> 42:48.591
Thas not gonna be me.

42:48.680 --> 42:52.434
What, one last score, retire
to some island? Is that the idea?

42:52.520 --> 42:55.034
- Jack.
- I'm partial to mountains myself,

42:55.120 --> 42:57.634
but if you like islands,
we'll make it an island.

42:57.720 --> 43:01.713
- What do you mean,
"we'll make it an island"?
- You and I can make it...

43:01.760 --> 43:04.115
- Jack, you better come
and check this out.
- Is that Buddy?

43:04.200 --> 43:06.794
- What? No. Okay. Bye-bye.
- Who're you talking to?

43:08.600 --> 43:10.431
- So she's a married woman.
- Right.

43:10.520 --> 43:12.909
But she goes to bed
with a prison escapee because...

43:13.000 --> 43:15.468
he tells her that
he misses his little girl.

43:15.520 --> 43:18.398
She tells the world about it.
But you protect her.

43:18.480 --> 43:21.199
You don't reveal her name.

43:21.240 --> 43:23.834
That makes it sound like
what she was doing was okay...

43:23.920 --> 43:25.956
as long as her husband
doesn't find out.

43:26.040 --> 43:30.511
Like the guy who cheats
on his wife, saying what
she doesn't know won't bother her.

43:30.560 --> 43:32.437
- Dad.
- What?

43:39.320 --> 43:42.312
Ray, I wanna show you
something... in the living room.

43:43.520 --> 43:45.875
- Yeah.
- Good talking to you, Ray.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.797
Yeah, you too.

43:51.640 --> 43:53.995
Federal law enforcement agents
raided a squatters' camp...

43:54.040 --> 43:56.600
north of Miami International
Airport this morning...

43:56.680 --> 44:01.708
in the hopes of capturing
a fugitive from Tuesday's daring escape
from Glades prison.

44:01.800 --> 44:05.475
F.B.I. Officials confirm that
one of the escapees, Arelio Linares,

44:05.560 --> 44:08.074
- was killed...
- Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.

44:08.120 --> 44:11.271
Chino's runnin' for his life.
He don't give a shit about you.

44:11.320 --> 44:14.995
He's gonna know by now
I gave him up back at Glades.
He's gonna wanna find me.

44:15.080 --> 44:17.833
Maybe see Adele,
see what she knows.

44:17.880 --> 44:20.519
He knows where she lives?

44:20.600 --> 44:23.160
Jack!

44:23.200 --> 44:25.111
We were talking once,
drinking rum,

44:25.200 --> 44:28.112
and I may have
mentioned Adele.

44:28.160 --> 44:30.549
How she worked for a magician.
Chino got all interested.

44:30.640 --> 44:33.154
He said, "How do you saw
the woman in half?"

44:33.240 --> 44:36.357
Maybe he wanted to meet her,
maybe see her if she came to visit.

44:36.440 --> 44:39.750
Oh, okay, okay. So you call her up
and tell her don't talk to any Cubans.

44:39.800 --> 44:42.872
- The phone's probably tapped by now.
- You're right.

44:42.960 --> 44:45.269
And if the phone is tapped,
you know they have her place staked out.

44:45.360 --> 44:47.032
Shit!

44:49.440 --> 44:51.317
Adele Delisi speaking.

44:51.360 --> 44:54.477
- Uh, uh, this is Adele?
- Yes, it is.

44:54.520 --> 44:56.397
Oh... Uh, sorry.
Wrong number.

45:12.280 --> 45:14.430
Nice disguise.

45:14.520 --> 45:16.351
I'm a tourist.

45:18.120 --> 45:20.759
All right. Here we go.

45:20.840 --> 45:24.833
Coming up right here...
on the left.

45:24.920 --> 45:27.957
- What about the guy with the clippers?
- I wonder what the F.B. I...

45:28.040 --> 45:30.554
is charging to trim hedges
these days?

45:30.640 --> 45:34.679
- Quite a checker game
they got goin' on too.
- Pull on up.

45:57.200 --> 45:59.316
Oh, man.

46:05.560 --> 46:07.755
Oh, man.

46:07.800 --> 46:09.791
Okay, you saw her.
Thas all you get.

46:15.600 --> 46:19.070
- Les go to Detroit.
- Now you're talkin', brother.

46:20.760 --> 46:23.479
I'll say one thing for Jack...
he's very considerate.

46:23.560 --> 46:25.471
Lights on or off,
if you know what I mean.

46:25.560 --> 46:27.312
- Really.
- Hmm.

46:30.280 --> 46:32.635
Adele, listen...

46:32.680 --> 46:37.231
I just want to find him
before he does something else
and makes it worse on himself.

46:37.320 --> 46:41.029
No. Buddy'll take care of him.

46:41.120 --> 46:44.635
Keep him out of trouble.
He's Jack's conscience, always has been.

46:44.680 --> 46:48.275
They must have robbed
50 banks together.

46:48.360 --> 46:51.989
- They were a really great team.
- Until they got busted.

46:52.040 --> 46:54.793
Hmm. That wasn't Jack's fault.
No, that was on account of...

46:54.880 --> 46:59.317
Buddy, for some reason, decided to call
his sister and confess to the job...

46:59.400 --> 47:01.630
before they'd done it
instead of after.

47:01.680 --> 47:06.117
Well, she called the F.B.I. They both
went down, and they ended up at Lompoc.

47:06.200 --> 47:09.112
I think Buddy felt
kind of bad about that.

47:10.400 --> 47:13.278
Adele, do you have any idea
where I could find Buddy?

47:13.320 --> 47:17.279
Or Glenn?

47:17.320 --> 47:19.754
Mira, Adele, you in there?

47:19.840 --> 47:22.877
- Yes.
- Mira, I'd like to speak to you, please.

47:22.920 --> 47:26.117
- Well, who is it?
- Emile, you know, the guy
you used to work for?

47:26.160 --> 47:29.118
- Uh...
- He gave me your number
and where you live.

47:29.160 --> 47:32.550
Mira, I'm looking for an assistant.
Can I speak to you, please?

47:32.640 --> 47:35.359
- Oh. Uh, yeah.
- All right.

47:35.400 --> 47:37.311
You did work for Emile, right?

47:37.360 --> 47:40.397
Uh, yeah, I was Emile's box jumper
for four years, almost.

47:40.480 --> 47:42.311
Cono! You were what, his box?

47:42.400 --> 47:44.311
- Uh, his assistant.
- Oh, okay.

47:46.320 --> 47:48.629
You say you perform
in the Miami area?

47:48.680 --> 47:51.433
Oh, si. Here, there, you know.

47:51.520 --> 47:54.956
I was a magician in Cuba. They used
to call me Manuelito the Magician.

47:55.040 --> 47:57.031
Mira, can you please open?

47:57.120 --> 48:00.749
- I'm not dressed.
- I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.

48:00.840 --> 48:04.196
- You know Jack?
- Who are you?

48:04.280 --> 48:06.271
Jose Chirino.

48:06.360 --> 48:10.273
Or maybe you heard Jack call me Chino.
Bueno, I'm the same guy.

48:10.360 --> 48:13.318
Tell him he has to wait in the hall.
You have to get dressed. Say it loud.

48:13.400 --> 48:15.550
Wait in the hall.
You have to get dressed.

48:15.600 --> 48:18.910
Mira, mira, you tell me
where I could find Jack
and I don't bother you no more.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.468
Now, come on, please! Hello?

48:21.560 --> 48:24.950
- I don't know where he is.
- I'm the guy that helped
Jack escape from prison.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.470
- Mira, please open this fucking door...
- I'm gonna call the police.

48:28.520 --> 48:33.389
Cono, why you gonna do that
to a friend, man? A partner to Jack?

48:34.720 --> 48:37.393
Thas it! Thas it!

48:44.120 --> 48:47.590
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Cono, mira, please!

48:47.680 --> 48:49.511
- Adele! Adele!
- Give me your hand.

48:49.600 --> 48:52.353
- You not Adele!
- I'm a federal marshal,
and you're under arrest.

48:52.440 --> 48:55.273
- Get my bag, Adele.
- Oh.

48:55.360 --> 48:57.316
Mira, please, please. I think
there's a misunderstanding here.

48:57.360 --> 48:59.237
Can you...
you got nice bag.

48:59.320 --> 49:02.915
Mira, les say we just forget about it,
okay? We forget about this, I go home...

49:03.000 --> 49:05.912
- Shut up.
- Owwww! Who the hell
taught you how to do that?

49:05.960 --> 49:07.996
- Give me your other hand.
- Okay, okay. Ay, cono.

49:08.040 --> 49:10.713
Ohhhh!
I gotta go make pee-pee.

49:10.760 --> 49:13.433
Ohhhhh! Owww!

49:13.480 --> 49:15.869
Wow! You are mean!

49:15.920 --> 49:20.152
Look, I'm gonna call my lawyer.
This is... What do they call that?
Human rights violation.

49:20.200 --> 49:23.237
- Ay, cono.
- Daniel Burdon, please. Karen Sisco.

49:23.320 --> 49:25.959
Mira, Adele, Adele.
Can I ask you a question, please?

49:26.040 --> 49:28.349
You know that trick you do?

49:28.440 --> 49:31.750
Karen? Where are you?
I've been trying to reach you.

49:31.840 --> 49:33.990
When you in the box
and they saw you in half?

49:34.080 --> 49:36.992
- I'm at Adele Delisi's.
- Is magic.

49:37.040 --> 49:39.395
We already talked to her.
Thas a dead end.

49:39.440 --> 49:43.911
I was just wondering,
if I brought in Chirino,
would you let me be on the task force?

49:44.000 --> 49:46.275
- Yeah, sure, Karen.
- Then they put the saw through,
and they separate it.

49:46.360 --> 49:49.909
- And thas it. Ta da.
- But how do you twinkle your toes?
I don't get that.

49:49.960 --> 49:53.191
You bring Chirino in,
and you can be on the task force.

49:53.280 --> 49:55.748
- Thas all I wanted to know.
- Good.

49:55.840 --> 49:58.912
Now, would you forget
about the ex-wife,

49:59.000 --> 50:01.275
and get over to the Adams Hotel?

50:01.320 --> 50:03.880
- You got it.
- Then they open it up...

50:03.960 --> 50:06.554
- No! No!
- Come on.

50:06.600 --> 50:10.275
- And then thas it.
- Fake legs.

50:10.320 --> 50:13.596
- Mmm.
- Fake legs? How you gonna...

50:13.640 --> 50:16.074
- Ay! Cono.
- Thanks, Adele.

50:16.160 --> 50:18.276
How do they twinkle their toes,
then, if is fake, mira?

50:21.400 --> 50:23.960
First thing we do,
we get to Detroit, we find Glenn,

50:24.040 --> 50:26.998
and we find a window
to throw him out of.

50:27.080 --> 50:28.911
I was thinkin', if I was Glenn,
and I was up there...

50:29.000 --> 50:30.911
to take down the Ripper,
where would I go?

50:30.960 --> 50:33.838
'Cept that if you were Glenn,
you wouldn't be thinkin'.

50:33.920 --> 50:35.876
Remember Snoopy Miller,
his old pal from the joint?

50:35.960 --> 50:38.599
Snoop? I figured
he'd be brain-dead by now.

50:38.680 --> 50:40.671
Nah, Snoop doesn't box anymore.

50:40.760 --> 50:43.479
Glenn told me that he's managing
some fighters out at the Kronk.

50:58.080 --> 51:00.514
- Did you get the key?
- They're in room 613.

51:03.200 --> 51:06.431
All right. I want
two men outside, front and back.

51:06.520 --> 51:11.036
Conroy, Jamison, go on up to six,
cover both ends of the hall.

51:12.200 --> 51:14.634
You're primary.
You're secondary.

51:14.720 --> 51:17.075
And you're point man.

51:17.160 --> 51:20.675
- You gonna use a ram?
- Yeah. Why?

51:20.760 --> 51:22.876
The manager's door is metal.

51:22.920 --> 51:24.876
You know what I mean,
they might all be.

51:24.960 --> 51:28.111
A ram on a metal door makes
a lot of noise for what good it does.

51:28.200 --> 51:30.919
I got a shock lock round
for my shotgun that oughta do the trick.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.831
Fine. Whatever.

51:43.080 --> 51:44.911
Two, please.

51:47.120 --> 51:48.997
You.

51:52.920 --> 51:56.959
Fuck it.
Les take the stairs. Karen...

51:57.000 --> 52:00.037
Take the radio. Stay down here
in the lobby and watch the elevator.

52:00.120 --> 52:03.795
- Daniel, I want to go upstairs.
- Well, you can wait
in the car if you want to.

52:05.400 --> 52:08.233
Now, you see Foley and Bragg
coming behind us. What do you do?

52:08.320 --> 52:12.074
- Call and tell you?
- And you let them come up.

52:12.160 --> 52:15.516
You don't try to make
the bust yourself. You understand?

52:21.440 --> 52:23.590
Is this your floor, ma'am?

52:24.800 --> 52:26.631
Is this your floor, ma'am?

52:26.720 --> 52:29.473
Oh. Oh, yes.

52:29.560 --> 52:32.279
Yes, it is. I'm sorry. Thank you.

52:35.720 --> 52:38.837
Be advised we are
approaching the door.

52:46.760 --> 52:50.594
Be advised we are
going to blow the door.

52:59.960 --> 53:01.791
Going up?

53:16.320 --> 53:18.550
Shit, I thought I was going up.

53:20.120 --> 53:22.918
She just looked right at me.

53:22.960 --> 53:26.032
- Who?
- Karen.

53:26.120 --> 53:29.476
- Karen Sisco?
- Yeah.

53:29.560 --> 53:31.471
She's in the lobby.

53:31.560 --> 53:33.391
- She's in the lobby?
- Yeah.

53:35.160 --> 53:38.311
They know where I live,
no doubt they know what I drive.
We gotta dump this car.

53:46.800 --> 53:48.916
She just sat there,
looking right at me.

53:53.320 --> 53:57.154
Karen, they're not up here.
Keep your eyes open.

53:58.160 --> 54:01.357
Karen? Karen, are you there?

54:02.280 --> 54:04.111
He waved at you?

54:04.200 --> 54:06.031
Couldn't swear to it,
but I'm pretty sure he did.

54:06.120 --> 54:08.111
- Did you wave back?
- I didn't have time.

54:08.200 --> 54:10.111
I imagine you would have, though.

54:11.560 --> 54:13.437
Buddy's sister, Regina Mary Bragg,

54:13.480 --> 54:15.357
got two calls from Buddy
in Detroit this morning.

54:15.400 --> 54:17.789
She calls Burdon.
She's also the one who called Burdon...

54:17.840 --> 54:20.070
- and gave him Buddy's address.
- So?

54:20.160 --> 54:23.277
So what I want to know is why he still
calls her even after she turned him in.

54:23.360 --> 54:25.316
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.
What I want to know is why,

54:25.360 --> 54:29.990
they got such a big score up north, did
Foley hang around Miami for so long?

54:30.080 --> 54:32.958
- Any thoughts on that?
- None I'd like to share.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.389
- I'll call you when I get in.
- Okay.

54:43.400 --> 54:46.119
Hey

55:01.000 --> 55:04.390
Time is truly wasting

55:04.480 --> 55:08.792
You know, I don't just deal product
and manage fighters no more.

55:08.840 --> 55:13.311
A los changed since the last time
you seen me, man. Is like I've, uh,

55:13.360 --> 55:16.033
vertically integrated myself,
you know, diversified and shit,

55:16.080 --> 55:17.991
and now I'm into
the occasional grand larceny,

55:18.080 --> 55:20.275
- home invasion, shit like that.
- Huh.

55:20.360 --> 55:22.430
White Boy Bob right there's
my all-around man, you know.

55:22.520 --> 55:27.355
He's my personal bodyguard when I feel
like I need one, driver, shit like that.

55:27.400 --> 55:29.834
Yo, man, watch the road, White Boy!
What you lookin' back here for?

55:29.920 --> 55:33.833
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

55:33.920 --> 55:35.751
- I like this car, Glenn.
- Yeah.

55:35.840 --> 55:37.831
You stole a good one, boy.

55:37.920 --> 55:40.832
You can roll around
in Ripley's neighborhood
up there in Bloomfield Hills,

55:40.920 --> 55:42.751
not get sweated
by the private security.

55:42.840 --> 55:45.638
Ain't gonna have no police on our ass,
nothing like that. Is nice, man.

55:46.760 --> 55:48.637
Yeah.

55:48.680 --> 55:51.558
Oh, hey, so you still haven't said
how you want to do this thing.

55:51.640 --> 55:55.838
Oh, I'm gonna tell you that
as soon as we get one other
brother I'm gonna need, uh,

55:55.880 --> 55:57.757
Kenneth...
thas Moselle's brother...

55:57.800 --> 56:01.110
along with White Boy right there.

56:01.160 --> 56:02.878
- What?
- All right, here we go, White Boy.

56:12.400 --> 56:14.755
Uh, who's the fireman?

56:16.720 --> 56:19.871
Ken dog.

56:19.920 --> 56:21.911
- Whas up, brother-in-law?
- Whas happenin', hustler?

56:23.640 --> 56:26.029
Hey, man. This cigarette
gonna bother you, Mo?

56:26.120 --> 56:29.954
Yeah, put that thing out, all right?
Ken, this is Glenn.

56:30.040 --> 56:33.112
- Glenn, thas Kenny,
the dude I was tellin' you about.
- Hi.

56:33.160 --> 56:36.391
You're the one gonna help us
rip off that rich white dude?

56:36.480 --> 56:39.790
- Yeah, thas him.
- Help you?

56:39.880 --> 56:41.996
Go ahead, White Boy.

56:45.880 --> 56:49.873
Um, whoa, wait a minute, um, look...

56:49.960 --> 56:54.192
Maurice, I am
letting you in on this gig,

56:54.280 --> 56:56.635
not...

56:56.680 --> 56:59.069
- You just asked
how we gonna do it, right?
- Yeah.

56:59.120 --> 57:00.997
Well, I'm telling you how, man.
We the experts.

57:02.680 --> 57:04.511
Person I'm worried about
is you, Glenn.

57:04.600 --> 57:07.239
- Me?
- Yeah.

57:07.280 --> 57:10.875
Can you step up and actually do this
shit instead of just talking the talk?

57:12.040 --> 57:14.156
Do what?

57:14.240 --> 57:16.515
Walk into this house
I got picked out.

57:16.560 --> 57:19.028
Do this cross-dressing nigger
named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to.

57:19.080 --> 57:22.834
- Been dealing on his own.
- What? When, man?

57:22.920 --> 57:25.957
Shit, right now, son.
What you think all this shit is for?

57:26.040 --> 57:28.998
I don't need to prove
shit to you, man, okay?

57:29.040 --> 57:32.191
The Ripley job is my job.
You're either in or you're not.

57:32.240 --> 57:35.755
You wanna go pop some crack dealer
pissed you off, man,

57:35.840 --> 57:38.718
- that is your problem,
not mine, fuck!
- Glenn,

57:38.760 --> 57:40.671
I know you supposed to be
cool and everything, okay,

57:40.720 --> 57:42.676
but you ain't got
to give me no tone of voice.

57:42.760 --> 57:46.639
You don't like what I'm sayin',
you just bounce the fuck out
this whip anywhere up in here.

57:46.720 --> 57:50.679
Okay, I think we're forgetting
that this is my whip.

57:52.680 --> 57:55.592
I brought it up.

57:55.680 --> 58:01.038
Shit. Hey, come on, man. If I say
this is my car, you know this is my car.

58:01.120 --> 58:03.350
You just get yourself
another one.

58:03.400 --> 58:06.676
If I say we in on this Ripley shit, we
in on it, with or without your punk ass.

58:06.760 --> 58:09.320
And if I say you gonna walk up in
this house and do this motherfucker...

58:09.400 --> 58:11.277
so I can see if you got
any balls or not,

58:11.360 --> 58:13.555
guess what else you gonna do?

58:13.640 --> 58:15.676
We're here.

58:16.840 --> 58:20.150
Tighten up your panties, boy.

58:22.120 --> 58:25.157
- Hacksaw. Okay, I'll take that.
- Oh, yeah.

58:25.240 --> 58:27.470
- Hatchet, man.
- Hatchet?

58:27.560 --> 58:31.235
What are you gonna do with a hatchet?

58:31.320 --> 58:34.471
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Les get some fire to that ass.

58:34.640 --> 58:36.995
Look here.
You want the.45 or the Glock?

58:39.320 --> 58:41.151
Glenn?

59:17.000 --> 59:18.877
Shit, boy.

59:30.120 --> 59:32.315
It was worse than you thought
it was gonna be, huh?

59:34.160 --> 59:36.469
You with the bad boys now, baby.

59:36.520 --> 59:38.397
Les go.

59:48.120 --> 59:49.951
What do you think?

59:50.040 --> 59:53.476
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and
now we got ourselves another partner.

59:54.760 --> 59:57.957
Hey, Studs, how ya doin'?

59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.918
Jesus Christ,
what are you guys doin' here?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.673
Weren't you expecting us?

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.437
Where's your sunglasses?
Somebody finally step on 'em for ya?

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.239
- I don't know.
- Whose blood you got on your shirt?

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:13.397
Listen, man,
these guys are crazy.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.675
- Snoop!
- Shit.

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.995
We have a problem here?

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.878
Jack Foley,
famous bank robber.

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.599
Snoopy Miller,
famous fight thrower.

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.513
Seems I read somewhere that you
broke out of a prison down in Florida.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.716
- Is that right?
- They got a low class
of people there, Snoop.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.109
Hey, you call him that again I'm gonna
put your head through the wall.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.355
What? You mean "Snoop"?

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.679
Nobody calls me Snoop or Snoopy
anymore is what White Boy Bob
is trying to tell you.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.035
He's just a little crude with it.
You know what I mean?

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.230
Nah, I left all that
behind me, partner.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.151
But you call this bozo
"White Boy."

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:50.232
White Boy Bob
used to be a fighter.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.999
Oh, so tell me, what do you
do now, White Boy Bob,

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.911
outside of shoot
your big mouth off?

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:00.394
- Like being back in the yard, isn't it?
- Yeah, just like it.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:02.391
Nobody backing down
or nothing.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.637
You back down, you just a pussy.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:09.190
- Why y'all in Detroit anyway,
up here in the cold?
- Glenn didn't tell you?

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:12.909
- Glenn? What?
- I thought you guys were busted.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.878
Why's that? 'Cause you left us
standing on the side of the road?

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.996
Whoops.

01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:22.839
Look, Snoop, I don't know
what Glenn promised you,

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.480
or what you think you're going
to get out of this... here's the deal:

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:28.353
Buddy and I, we're going to take half
of anything we get off of Ripley.

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.351
Anything else, you guys are
allowed to cut up any way you want.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.193
Oh. Why don't we talk
about this outside, man?

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.759
- Nice in here. Is warm.
- Warm? Is like
90 degrees in here, man.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.956
Sometimes is 100 up in this mug.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.036
Thas the way Emmanuel
like to keep it.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.355
Keep his fighters mean and lean like
Tommy Hearns. Ain't that right, Kenny?

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.510
I got someplace to be anyway,
so tell you what:

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.437
Why don't y'all come by
the fights Friday night?

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:51.869
We'll sit down,
chop it up, you know, look it over.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.952
- State Theater.
- All right. We'll see you then.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.272
So it must take a lot of balls
to walk into a bank and
stick it up with a gun, huh?

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.828
I don't know. I never used
a gun before in my life.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.751
You're kidding.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.957
You'd be surprised what all you can get
if you ask for it the right way.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:20.033
Well, you're the reason, my friend, that
I don't keep all my money in the bank.

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.275
So where do you keep
your money, Dick?

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.191
Talking about all those
uncut diamonds you told about.

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:27.397
- I know what you're talking about.
- You're the one with balls.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.396
Say something like that
to somebody like Glenn?

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.119
Glenn? Come on, nobody's
going to believe Glenn.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.555
- Do you believe Glenn?
- Uh, no, I don't.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.478
Besides, even if it was true,
he'd still have to know
where I keep 'em, wouldn't he?

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.233
Doesn't have to know anything.
You told him you keep 'em in your house.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.949
Is a very big house.
So, how much longer you in here for?

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:48.636
Uh, 22 months,
three days, two hours.

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:52.389
- Why?
- 'Cause I could use a guy like you.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.517
Somebody that knows how to ask
for things in the right way.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.437
I'm talking about
when you're out of here.

01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.835
After all, you can't rob banks
forever, can you?

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.758
- I'm not exactly a nine to five type.
- Who is?

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.351
I thought everybody liked Eddie.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.118
- How you doin', Ray?
- I'm freezing.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.509
But I'm getting warmer.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:26.593
So listen, other than we had so much fun
the last time we worked together,

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.989
you want to tell me why you're coming
to me instead of the F.B. I?

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.759
I go to the F.B.I.,
the first thing they're
gonna do is send me to get some coffee.

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.671
You know what?
You're right.

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:37.070
Ray, about a year ago,
D.E.A. Had a guy, Glenn Michaels,
on possession with intent.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:40.391
- Listen, is that your car?
Find out whose it is.
- They couldn't make it stick.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:43.358
In his statement, he said he was coming
to Detroit to see a friend...

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.311
about job opportunities,
if you can believe that.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.391
- What was the name of the friend?
- Maurice Miller,

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.358
also known as Snoopy,
used to be a prizefighter.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.908
I know Snoopy.
He's a fucking wack job.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.230
He thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard,
hangs out over on the west side...

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.953
with a couple of other
first-rate nut cases.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.190
- Well, I'm gonna need
a last known address.
- 2710 coming in.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.794
- You're gonna need what?
- A last known address.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.513
That your car?

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.478
No way. I don't want you
talking to Miller alone.

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.559
Come on, Ray. I'm a federal officer.
I can handle myself. I'm armed.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.677
I'll call you tomorrow
with the address.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.951
Thank you, Raymond.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.349
You see the paper?

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.595
- Is a terrific shot of her.
- Outside of that.

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.956
Doesn't say what she's doing here,
but I don't think it has
anything to do with us.

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.474
She came up here on her vacation
because she likes shitty weather.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.397
Nah, I think she's after Glenn.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.476
The girl still there?

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:39.557
They don't stay the whole night, Jack,
unless you pay for it.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:44.111
- Did you tell your sister?
- Yeah, I just hung up.
She prayed for me.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:47.397
- Mm-hmm. And how long were you
on the phone with her?
- Two hours.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:51.075
- And how long were you with the girl?
- 45 minutes.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.991
You didn't tell your sister
about Ripley, did you?

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.389
Look, Jack, just forget
about my sister, okay?

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:58.238
Now, if Karen Sisco is
tailing Glenn, we're fucked.

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.271
Tomorrow night at the fights,
we all get picked up.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.750
Why don't we just drive by where
we're meeting tonight, check it out.

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.671
And we'll go by Ripley's too,
while we're at it.

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:07.990
- Yeah, all right.
- All right.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.715
- Athenaeum Hotel, how may I help you?
- Karen Sisco, please.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.990
- Hello, Best Western.
- Karen Sisco, please.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:30.271
- Moselle Miller?
- What do you want?

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:34.273
- I'm looking for Maurice.
- You find him, tell him
the dog got run over.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.237
I'm out of grocery money.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:39.437
- Moselle, who you talkin' to?
- Lady lookin' for Maurice.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.476
- What does she want?
- Hasn't said.

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:44.870
- Thas not Maurice?
- Thas Kenneth, my brother.
He's talkin' on the phone.

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.554
- Ask her what she want with him!
- You ask her!

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.552
- Maurice business
is none of my business.
- Yeah, you damn right.

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:54.316
State Theater, huh?
Who's fightin'?

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:58.154
Nigger, what?

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:03.274
I'm looking for somebody
I think Maurice knows.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.070
You're not with probation,
one of those?

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.277
- No.
- You a lawyer?

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.312
No, I'm not. I'm looking
for somebody named Glenn Michaels.

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:18.071
Glenn? I don't know any Glenn.

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:20.031
He said he stayed here
last November.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.759
- Here in this house?
- He said he stayed with Maurice.

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:26.276
Well, he ain't
even here that much.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.117
I'd like to know where he goes,
but at the same time,

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.919
I don't wanna know,
you understand?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.798
Yeah.

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:37.395
- You say your dog was killed?
- Got run over by a car.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:42.434
- Whad you call him?
- Was a she. Named Tuffy.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:47.240
Where do you think
I might find Maurice, Moselle?

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:50.118
I don't know.
The gym, the fights.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:54.119
I know he don't miss the fights.
They're havin' some tomorrow
down at the State Theater.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.390
- He used to take me.
- The State Theater.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.630
Why you askin'
all these questions about Maurice?

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.631
She lookin' for a man name of Glenn.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.717
Did I ask you? Go on and do something
with yourself, Moselle.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:07.588
Why don't you take your ass
to Dot and Etta's and get us
some shrimp or somethin'?

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.349
- You're a fighter.
- How you know that?

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:22.437
- I can tell.
- Yeah, I was.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:26.269
'Til I got my retina
detached two times.

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:31.668
- Whad you fight, about middleweight?
- Nah, light.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.632
Super middleweight,
once my body developed.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:39.469
- What you go about, what, a bantam?
- Flyweight.

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:43.872
Nigger, what?
You know your divisions, huh?

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:47.071
Do you like the fights?
You like the rough stuff?

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.833
Yeah, I bet you do.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.195
You like to get down
and tussle a little bit?

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:55.397
Like me and Tuffy,
before she got run over.

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:57.675
We used to get down on the floor
and tussle all the time.

01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:03.357
I'd say to her, "You a good bitch,
Tuffy. Here's a treat for ya."

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:07.871
And I give Tuffy what all good bitches
love best, and you know what that is?

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.312
Know what that is? A bone.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.550
I'll give you
a good bone too, girl.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.477
You're not my type.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.120
No, that shit
don't mean nothin' to me.

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:23.670
- I let the monster out,
you gonna do what it wants.
- I gotta go, Kenneth.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.950
- Maybe we'll see each other again.
- No, no, we gonna tussle first.

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:29.390
Awww!

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:32.198
Damn it!
What the fuck was that?

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:35.716
You wanted to tussle.
We tussled.

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:40.839
Thas a big ass house.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.751
Place almost looks
like a prison.

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:45.035
No doubt he's got some
serious security system.

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:48.078
Time comes, we go up, knock on the door,
see if he wants to talk about old times.

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.754
- You know, the easy way.
- Cool.

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:54.435
Think he'll let us in, we got the Snoop
and that musclebound asshole with us?

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.350
Nobody's gonna be with us.

01:08:56.439 --> 01:08:59.033
I say we go to the fights tomorrow
night, see what Snoopy's big plan is,

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:02.356
then we go in,
ahead of him, alone.

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:04.270
Oh, I can dig it.

01:09:04.359 --> 01:09:06.953
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop,
while we off livin' the good life.

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.429
Good life. Buddy, you know anybody
who's done one last big score...

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.357
and then gone on
to live the good life?

01:09:11.399 --> 01:09:14.437
Look, Jack, there's a chance
we'll walk out of here with nothin'.

01:09:14.479 --> 01:09:16.390
I say,
let fate decide.

01:09:16.479 --> 01:09:19.198
Let fate decide? What are you,
the fuckin' Dalai Lama now?

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.117
Nah, man,
is my sister.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:23.276
My sister believes
in fate but not hell.

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:25.316
Thas why she stopped praying
for all the lost souls,

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:27.470
since you don't hear that much
about purgatory anymore.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:30.756
But every day, she asks her boss
to pray that Buddy don't fuck up.

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.308
I mean, what do you think?

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:35.755
- Well...
- You think there's a hell?

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:38.593
Yeah, is called
the Glades Correctional Institute.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.948
I'm sure as shit not going back there
or any place like it.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.229
They put a gun on you,
you'll go, brother.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.758
They put a gun on you,
you still have a choice.

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:53.874
So, Mr. Foley,

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:58.317
Mr. Ripley and I have
had a long discussion
about your role in the company,

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.868
and it was his feeling you'd be
happiest working down here in Miami.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.428
- How's that sound to you?
- Sounds great.

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:06.637
Good. You're about
a 42 long, right?

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:12.589
I uh, I'm about a 42...

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.511
like, 42 regular.

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:24.316
- Okay, les see how she fits.
- What is that?

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.237
Your uniform.

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:30.191
My uniform.

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.431
Mr. Foley. Mr. Foley!

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:36.630
Sir, sir. Excuse me, sir.

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.955
Sir! Sir, excuse me!

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.996
- You can't go in there!
- Are you fucking kidding me?
A security guard?

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.548
- What are you, stoned?
- Hey, hey! Take it easy!

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.471
Is all right, Peggy.
Is under control.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.956
You know something?

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.873
I wasn't sure that you'd show up here,
but I was very sure if you did,

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.474
you'd throw this job
in my face.

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:57.391
Let me tell you
something.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:00.790
Every single thing you've done
with your life up until this point...

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.195
in the real world
means nothing.

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.117
Less than nothing.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:07.151
You're a bank robber.

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:09.834
Thas not
a very marketable skill.

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.514
We don't see a lot
of old bank robbers walking around...

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.398
with a pension plan,
now do we?

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.357
I think you know this.
Thas why you're here.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.034
Today, I've offered you...

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:23.237
a lousy job with a lousy wage.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:27.233
You want something better?
Why don't you show me you can change?

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:30.392
Then I'll offer you
something better, a lot better.

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:33.796
But until then, my friend,
you'll have to earn it.

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:36.991
How, Dick?
The way you earn it?

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.031
Married some rich broad
owns the company,

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.076
selling it off a piece at a time
then divorcing her?

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:46.352
Whas this Knute Rockne "pull yourself
up by the bootstraps" bullshit?

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:49.477
Back in prison, a guy like you
in a place like that?

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:52.711
You were ice cream for freaks.
A goddamned dumpling.

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.156
Maurice and a dozen other guys would
have bled you till you had nothing.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.237
Until you were nothing.
I saved your ass!

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.709
So you'll pardon me if I don't want
to sit on a fucking stool all day,

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:04.837
and say, "Sign in here, please,"
or "Hey, pal, you can't park here."

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.957
All right, Dick?
I can't fuckin' do it, Dick!

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.917
- I'm disappointed in you.
- You wanna...

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:12.428
Oh, here we go.
What job did he promise you boys?

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:14.954
- There's two ways we can do this.
- Yeah, what are they?

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:01.679
Hey, Buddy, I gotta get a better pair
of shoes and some things for tomorrow.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.591
Drop me off by the Ren Center
and we'll hook up later?

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:06.433
Yeah, okay.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.833
I better go call my sister.

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:25.628
Can I get you anything?

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:27.995
Yeah, I'll have a bourbon, please.
Water back.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.917
Okay.

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:35.232
Hey, Tad, why don't
you do us again, please?

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.392
Oh, and, Celeste,
put the lady's drink on our bill.

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:52.277
- They want to buy your drink for you.
- Yeah, I get that.

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.590
- Tell them I'd rather pay for my own.
- Okay.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.031
I'll find out.

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.431
Excuse me.

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:08.875
My associates and I,
we made a little bet...

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:10.837
on what you do
for a living.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.753
And I won.
Hi. I'm Phillip.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:17.349
If is okay with you,
Phillip, I'd rather just
have a quiet drink and leave.

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:21.149
Don't you want to know what I guessed?
How I know what you do for a living?

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:24.232
Really, Phillip, I don't want to be
rude. I just want to be left alone.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.869
Is a little cold over there.

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:41.509
Excuse me.
I think I know why you're depressed.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:44.672
If I can offer
my observation.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:48.837
See, I got a hunch
you're the new sales rep,

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:53.914
and the cliens not exactly knocked out
by the fact that a young lady...

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:58.078
even one as stunning as yourself...
is handling the account.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.918
Am I close?

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.831
I'm Andy.

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:09.873
We're all ad guys. Flew in this morning
from the apple... New York.

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:12.633
Came in to pitch
Hiram Walker Distillery.

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:15.592
Little test market campaign
for the new margarita mix.

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:19.639
Is really pretty interesting.
We take this, um,

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:22.154
Mex... um,
Hispanic bandito...

01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:25.630
with his bullet belts and everything,
and the big Chihuahua hat,

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.393
and he pulls out
his six-guns,

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:31.870
- and these guys back here...
- Andy.

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.956
Really.
Who gives a shit?

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:38.750
- Do you want to tell me what happened?
- Beat it, Andy.

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.031
Andy.

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:50.951
Whad you do?

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:06.353
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Yeah, I'd love one.

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.635
Sit down.

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:24.511
I'm Gary.

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.911
I'm Celeste.

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:33.078
- It takes forever to get a drink.
There's only one waitress.
- I can go to the bar.

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:35.390
- Oh, don't go.
- Are those guys bothering you?

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:37.357
No, they're fine.
I mean, you just got here.

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.517
Here, help yourself.

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:47.754
- You like bourbon?
- I love it.

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:51.116
We got that out of the way. Tell me,
Celeste, what do you do for a living?

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:54.636
I'm a sales rep,
and I came here to call on a customer,

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:56.756
but they gave me a hard time
'cause I'm a girl.

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:58.671
Is that how
you think of yourself?

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:00.591
- As a sales rep?
- As a girl.

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.591
- Yeah, I don't have a problem with it.
- I like your hair.

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:06.428
- I like your outfit.
- Actually, this is
my second favorite outfit.

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:09.717
I had a first favorite, but it got
ruined and I had to get rid of it.

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.631
- You did?
- It smelled.

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:14.109
- Really? Having it
cleaned didn't help?
- No.

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:16.031
So tell me, Gary,
what do you do for a living?

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:18.998
- How far do you want
to go with this?
- Don't say anything yet.

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.355
I don't think it works
if we're somebody else.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.271
I mean, Gary and Celeste,
what do they know about anything?

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:25.794
- Well, this is your game,
I've never played before.
- Is not a game.

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:27.950
Is not something you play.

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:29.951
Well, does this make
any sense to you?

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.230
It doesn't have to.
Is something that happens.

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:37.155
Is like seeing
someone for the first time...
like you could be passing on the street,

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:40.357
and you look at each other
and for a few seconds...

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:43.716
there's this kind of a recognition...
like you both know something.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:46.553
The next moment,
the person's gone,

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:49.876
and is too late
to do anything about it.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:52.679
And you always remember it,
because it was there, and you let it go,

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:55.951
and you think to yourself,
"What if I had stopped?
If I had said something?"

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:57.871
"What if?"

01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:59.837
"What if?"

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:03.793
And it may only happen
a few times in your life.

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:09.191
- Or once.
- Or once.

01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:46.314
How'd you find me?

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:48.231
Uh...

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:52.155
Called your room
from downstairs.

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:54.555
Oh.

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.751
And if I had answered,
what were you gonna say?

01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:01.998
I would say who I was,
and do you remember me,
and want to meet for a drink?

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:06.790
If I remembered you.
I came here looking for you.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:09.519
All right, so then I would have
said yes, but for all you know,

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.909
I could have had a SWAT team waiting
for you... why would you trust me?

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.911
Ld be worth the risk.

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:16.394
- You like taking risks.
- So do you.

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.830
You know, sooner or later...

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:27.477
You really wear that suit.

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:29.994
Well, thas not
what you were about to say.

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.833
- Remember how talkative
you were in the trunk?
- Mm-hmm.

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:35.673
- Adele said you do that
when you're nervous.
- Oh, she did, did she?

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:41.073
- You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
- But in a nice way.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:02.472
You know, that Sig
you took from me was special.

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:04.437
My dad gave it to me
for my birthday.

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:06.317
Yeah?

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.391
What were you going
to do with me?

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.914
I hadn't really worked
that part out yet.

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:13.076
All I knew is that I liked you,
and that I didn't wanna...

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:15.230
leave you there on the side of the road
and never see you again.

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.717
Then you waved to me
in that elevator.

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:21.558
Yeah, I wasn't sure if you caught that.

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:24.518
I couldn't believe it.
By that time I had been...

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.750
thinking about you a lot...

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:30.110
and just wondering
what it would be like if we met,

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:33.112
if we could take a time-out.

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:35.435
I was thinking the same thing.

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:38.273
I kept thinking,
"What if we took a time-out?"

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:42.029
If we... just spent
some time together.

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.511
- You know, I saw you on the street.
- Where?

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.989
Outside Adele's.

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.799
- You went to see her?
- To warn her about Chino.

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:56.997
- So she did help you.
- I don't think we should get into that.

01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:59.031
You're right.
And I won't ask about Buddy,

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:04.393
or what you guys are doing
in Detroit, or if you've run
into Glenn Michaels yet...

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:07.199
Okay, now, don't talk like that,
because you scare me.

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:21.233
- Les get out of here.
- Yeah.

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.874
There's something
I want you to know.

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:18.110
I wasn't just looking for a fuck,
if thas what you're thinking.

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:20.714
- Or, I was...
- Why are you mad?

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:24.236
I was looking for some kinky thrill...
you know, score with the bank robber.

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.959
- The way some women go for rough trade...
- All right.

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:30.874
Now I can say that I fucked
a U.S. Marshal. Do you think I will?

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:33.070
I don't know.

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:34.991
Mm-hmm.

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.397
Come here.

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:52.635
I know a guy...

01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:55.672
walks into a bank with a bottle,
tells everybody is nitroglycerine.

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:58.234
He scores some cash
off of the teller.

01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:01.477
On his way out, he drops the bottle.
It cracks on the floor.

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:04.990
He slips in it. He smacks up
his head. They get him.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:08.629
The nitroglycerine
was canola oil.

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:12.275
I know more fucked-up bank robbers
than ones that know what they're doing.

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:16.353
I doubt one in ten could tell you
where the dye pack is.

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.834
Most bank robbers
are fucking morons.

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:23.152
For you to go to bed with one
for kinky thrills,

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:26.437
like you were saying,
makes you as dumb as they are.

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:28.357
Now, you are not dumb.

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:34.636
Why would you think that? Why would
you think that I would think that?

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:39.597
You're not dumb.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.430
Well, I don't know about that.

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:46.478
I mean, you can't do three falls
and think you have much of a brain.

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.757
Come here.

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:08.796
You're getting
serious on me now.

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:13.790
Tryin' not to.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:19.069
I just want to know
whas gonna happen.

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:27.751
You know.

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.790
Put it together now. Put it together!
Upstairs and downstairs.

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:20.713
- He don't want
to see you downstairs!
- Man, you drink like a bitch!

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.874
He don't want to see you... Get your
tussle on. Joe, get your tussle on!

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:27.190
Yeah, don't let him
out that corner.

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:29.356
Don't let him out, now.

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:35.190
Hey, you know what?
I gotta go take a pee.

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:38.994
What are you tellin' us for?
You want somebody to hold your pecker?

01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:42.270
Do that work, Joe!

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:44.191
Put it together now, Joe!

01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.714
Thas it, baby!

01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:50.275
Take him deep!
Oh, oh, my God, I love it.

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:52.430
Put him to sleep, Joe!
Put him to sleep, Joe!

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:55.239
Sit down, Kenny.
Thas it! Thas it!

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:34.240
- You tryin' to steal this car, Glenn?
- Don't, don't, don't!

01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:37.711
Oh, my God,
I can't believe this!

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:41.839
Another one of those days, huh?
Nothing seems to be going right.

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:43.831
- I don't have the keys to the car.
- I see that.

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:46.633
No, I mean I am not
fucking stealing the car!

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:50.554
- You're not?
- No, I already stole it a week ago,

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.955
whenever it was,
in West Palm.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.911
So I can't be
stealing it again, can I?

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.594
- Put your hands on the wheel, please.
- Okay, so now you're gonna...

01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:59.915
bust me for pickin' up
a car, what the...

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.389
For the car, for aiding
and abetting a prison escape,

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:05.477
and for conspiring to do
whatever you came here for.

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:08.393
Listen to me. These guys, they're gonna
be out here any minute looking for me,

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:11.631
and they're
fucking animals, man.

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:15.870
Whas going on, Glenn?

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:18.480
Nothing. I just wanna
get the fuck outta here.

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.835
I thought this whole thing
was your idea.

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:22.911
Okay, ripping off Ripley
was my idea,

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.595
but these guys, they are
in a whole other level of their own.

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:29.598
- Ripley, the Wall Street guy?
- Yeah, the plan was...

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:31.551
to pick him up
at his office tomorrow...

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:34.398
and drive him out
to his house in Bloomfield Hills.

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:37.796
And now I don't give a shit
what the guys do, you know?

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:41.196
- And Foley was part of this.
- Yeah, he's supposed to be,
but he hasn't showed up yet,

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.350
- which is good for him.
- Why?

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:46.995
Because Maurice is
gonna kill him.

01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:49.878
Like, try to collect
the reward money or something.

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:52.793
But you say he hasn't shown up yet.
You think he backed out?

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:55.718
I don't know.
He doesn't exactly confide in me.

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:58.756
I wonder why.

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:02.190
Okay, if you're gonna do this,
les do it and get out of here.

01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:04.589
I am freezing
my ass off!

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:07.069
If you wanna get out of here, run.
Ill warm you up.

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.997
Oh, ha, ha.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.594
Really?

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:19.990
I swear to God, Glenn, if I find out
that you are lying to me, l...

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.951
I know, you will find me.
I believe it.

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:30.437
Hey, know what
I was thinkin'?

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:33.313
If you didn't drive me
to the federal court last summer,

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.231
you wouldn't even
know who I am.

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:40.189
If I didn't know you, Glenn,
by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:42.748
Think of it that way.
Now run.

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:52.111
Yeah! Yeah!

01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:57.637
I'm tellin' you,
man, the money is here.

01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:00.797
- Snoop.
- Hey, is the bank robbers.

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:02.751
Y'all missin' the fights, man.
Pull up a chair.

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:05.155
- Who's sittin' here?
- Oh, thas your homey, Glenn, man.

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:07.071
But he bounced to the bathroom
a couple minutes ago...

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:09.151
- and we ain't seen him since.
- Musve fell in, man.

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:11.077
No doubt.

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:13.549
Yeah, sent these two looking for him.
They came back shaking their heads.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.468
Well, if he left his coat
and he's been gone a while, then...

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:19.551
- Car's here, man. I checked.
- Yeah.

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:22.757
- All right. We're leavin'.
- Leavin'?

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:24.751
- What the fuck, Foley?
- Stupid, you know where Glenn is.

01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:27.832
- Look, what you worried
about Glenn for, what he know?
- I thought everything.

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:30.917
No, Glenn know everything
thas supposed to happen tomorrow.

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:34.430
Now, he may run and tell somebody that,
but that don't mean shit.

01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:36.994
Glenn don't know
I changed the plan.

01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.873
Is happenin' tonight.
Soon as we leave here.

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:43.077
Go back by the house, pick up some shit
we gonna need, and we just gonna do it.

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:52.355
- Give me a minute to talk to Buddy.
- You got two minutes, thas all.

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.914
- Make up your mind, Foley.
- I wasn't asking permission.

01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:07.511
- You know they're gonna set us up.
- I get that feeling, yeah.

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:09.915
You think you can get
to the diamonds before they do?

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:15.435
I'll make you a deal.
You get outta here right now.

01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:18.717
I'll do the job with Snoop. I'll meet
you anywhere you want, give you half.

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:22.435
- Half for doin' what?
- Gettin' me out of Glades, for starters.

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:26.074
Who's gonna watch
your back?

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:07.155
All right, White Boy.
House call.

01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:21.319
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.749
- Ready to do this, baby?
- Ready for whatever.

01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:33.638
Cool. My shit always work.

01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:37.879
Perennial Plumbing.

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.753
Somebody in the house called.

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:45.076
You don't know what you're talking
about, because no one was here.

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:47.549
- Les go skiing.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:52.997
You still got time
to take me up on my offer.

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:55.554
And leave you alone
with these assholes?

01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:01.349
- Raymond Cruz.
- Ray, is Karen Sisco.
I'm at Ripley's house.

01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:03.954
I just saw Maurice Miller and four other
suspects force their way into the house.

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:05.871
They're armed.
I'm gonna need backup.

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.197
- Who are you?
- I work here.

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:10.271
I'm the maid. Fuck off!

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:13.432
- Thas exactly what I'm gonna do:
Fuck you, then off you.
- Hey, not yet.

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:16.790
- Where Ripley at?
- He isn't here.

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:21.231
- Out for the evening or some shit?
- He's in Florida... Palm Beach.

01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:24.949
- When's he due back?
- What difference does it make?
You gonna wait for him?

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.391
Mr. Ripley's down for the season.
Christmas to Easter.

01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:32.358
Stop that shit, man.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:34.470
You're here all by yourself?

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:36.835
Thas right. Just me.

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:44.952
- Where Ripley's safe at,
keeps his valuables in?
- I don't have any idea.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.390
I fuckin' bet you don't.

01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:51.631
We gonna take a look upstairs
in the man's bedroom, all right?

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:54.632
You and Mr. Buddy look
at all the rooms down here.

01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:56.551
Check the paintings,
behind the walls.

01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:59.916
Check the fuckin' walls
in the closets. The man's
got a safe. Is here somewhere.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.911
What about his place
down in Florida?

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:05.111
If you called, we could have checked
the walls down there before we left.

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:08.470
That is, if you'd bothered to find out
where he was. You follow me?

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:12.269
Man, take this bitch upstairs.

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:15.193
Upstairs!

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:19.714
Listen, you try and trip any alarms,
anything like that,

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:22.593
you gonna be a dead Hazel,
you understand me?

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.988
- Hey, hey, where we at? Where is it?
- Over there.

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:31.119
- Ever wear one of these?
- I don't ski.

01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:34.431
Keep an eye on the maid.
I'll have a look around.

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:41.474
Go sit down. Please.

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:50.911
Damn, Mo. How's this motherfucker
livin', man? Shit!

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:53.918
Check behind the pictures
on the walls, man.

01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:59.191
Hey, Mo. Found some rubbers.

01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:01.959
White Boy, why the fuck
you lookin' under the mattress?

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.639
You know dude ain't gonna hide
no diamonds under there.

01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:07.069
Damn! Dumb 'bama motherfucker.

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:11.716
- Where Foley at, man?
- He's checkin' the other rooms
like you said, boss.

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:15.873
Man, keep a eye on Foley.

01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:27.830
Ken, stop fuckin' with the radio.
Put on a CD.

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:31.350
- I don't recognize
none of these bands, Mo.
- Just pick somebody.

01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:33.550
What, "How To Sing
Like Michael Bolton"?

01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:39.148
What the fuck you wanna
listen to, huh?

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:43.552
- I like Schubert.
- Schubert? Well, I don't.

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:49.715
Uh, Foley?

01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:00.637
Cool.

01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.477
911 got you on hold, Richard?

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:03.871
- Foley!
- How you doin'?

01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:06.076
What in Goďs name
is happening here?

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.839
- Who's upstairs?
- Snoopy Miller, couple of his friends.

01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:11.878
- Maurice, from Lompoc?
- Yup.

01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:13.797
Have they got Midge up there?

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:16.354
What kind of a man lets a woman
answer the door this time of night?

01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:19.910
We thought it was her husband.
He comes here and checks up on her.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.877
I'm supposed to be
down in Florida.

01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:24.269
In a few minutes, you're gonna
wish you were. Les go, come on.

01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:26.396
Why don't you sit down?
We'll have a look at your fish.

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:34.199
Oh, thas workin'.
Thas workin'.

01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:42.439
Motherfucker!
I found the safe, yo!

01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:46.717
Don't go nowhere.

01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:53.632
- Oh, shit! We gonna have a party!
- Look at that bitch.

01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:06.318
They found the safe.

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:08.960
- Fuck.
- Buddy, you remember
Richard, don't you?

01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:12.430
- Yeah, hi. Nice house.
- Thank you.

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:17.115
Yeah, man.
We just all hit this handle,

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:19.037
blow this sucker
wide open, man.

01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:21.674
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Les get ready.

01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:24.320
Oh, Dude... you're gonna
kill me with that.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.560
- Where you been, man?
- Found some steaks.

01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:33.393
- Steaks?
- Yeah, some big ones, bro.

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.396
Man, come on.
Blast this damn safe open, man.

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:39.268
- He's down there lookin' for food.
- Fool.

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:44.593
All right. Hold it. No.
Get to the side, man. All right.

01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:48.110
On three.
One, two, three.

01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:53.312
- Jesus Christ, they're shooting Midge!
- Sit down, Dick.

01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:55.356
They're trying to open up
the safe, not your maid.

01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:00.036
Oh, shit.

01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:01.951
Man, we didn't even crack
this sum' bitch.

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:14.515
- Okay, hit the hinges.
- Uh-huh.

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:17.279
Put your finger in your ear, man.
This is gonna be loud.

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:20.153
All right, on three. One, two...

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:24.995
The combination is 3-10-44.

01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:30.669
- Richarďs birthday.
- Thank you.

01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:51.110
Are they dead?

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.831
We gotta find Foley, man.

01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:57.793
Can't believe you're still angry with me
after all this time.

01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:00.638
I'm not angry with you, Richard.
In fact, I'm completely relaxed.

01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:04.633
The thing is, I can't figure if
is the fish that are cooling me out,

01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:08.633
or all those uncut diamonds
in the bottom of the tank, there.

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:16.871
Goddamn.

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:19.520
Dumb-fuck Glenn was right.
You got about 5 million worth in there?

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:21.431
Five point two.

01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:25.275
They just look
like plain ol' rocks!

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.715
They sure do.
You wanna grab 'em, Buddy?

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.356
If I were you,
I'd get up and run.

01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:40.477
- I'm not leaving Midge.
- Don't be an asshole.
They're gonna kill you.

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:44.394
Well, if thas my fate then so be it,
but I'm not leaving her.
I'm in love with her.

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:50.636
- Come on, Jack.
- Good luck, Richard.

01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:09.710
- Come on, Jack.
- Shit. They're gonna rape
that maid, aren't they?

01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:12.360
By the look of those guys,
they'll rip her too.

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:14.277
- Then they're gonna kill 'em.
- At least.

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:18.511
Rip, Rip.

01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:21.114
- Tricky motherfucker.
- Are those my suits?

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:24.954
Naw. These are my suits.
Look at you, man.

01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:27.717
Where you been hidin', Dick?

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.831
We made it, didn't we?

01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:33.992
- All you gotta do is
get in the van, baby.
- I'm goin' back in.

01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:37.316
- I'm goin' with you.
- No, you dump the van,
meet me at the airport.

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:39.430
- I'll get one of Ripley's cars.
- Jack...

01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:43.638
The shit thas about to go
down here, you'll be on the phone
with your sister for a month.

01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:47.952
- All I'm sayin' is we're square.
- Here.

01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:50.315
Yep.

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:52.231
Jack.

01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:01.111
Get outta here.

01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:22.396
- Get that shit off.
- Get your hands off me!

01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:25.233
Fuck you, shut up!
Nobody's gonna help you.

01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:30.156
- Midge!
- Fuck Midge, man.
Where the jewels at, Dick?

01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:33.835
- Foley... Foley's got them.
Go after Foley!
- Where the fuck is Foley, man?

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:42.551
Midge?

01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:50.590
- Midge!
- Sit your punk ass down, man.

01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:54.194
- Ooh, goddamn!
- Son of a bitch!

01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:57.511
Man, take the front stairs.
I'm gonna take the back.

01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:02.879
- You all right?
- Where's Richard?

01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:06.475
He's downstairs.
You wait here.

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:14.829
Hold it, asshole.
Drop the gun.

01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:17.911
Drop it!

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.956
Put the damn gun down, now.

01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:23.753
Now!

01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:26.792
Put it down!

01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:32.832
Stay right there.
Don't move. Maurice!

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:34.757
I got Foley!

01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:38.991
Maurice!

01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:10.879
Ain't got another clip
I can use, do you?

01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:13.155
No, I don't.

01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:18.956
- You ain't never shot
a gun before, have you?
- Not until recently, no.

01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:21.349
- You a little nervous?
- Little bit, yeah.

01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:25.831
You know, a situation like this
has a high potentiality...

01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:27.751
for the common motherfucker
to bitch out.

01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:30.479
So I figure, why take a chance?

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:34.151
Bitch!

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:38.471
- Aw, sh...!
- Motherfucker!

01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:14.316
Stop! Put your hands in the air!

01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:32.151
Jack?

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:36.632
- I know you're up there.
- Shit!

01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:42.440
- Where's Kenneth?
- He's up here.

01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:46.870
He's dead.

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:10.829
- Come on, Jack, don't.
- Pretend is not me.

01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:13.912
- You think I'd shoot you?
- If you don't, somebody else will.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.515
Whare you now?
A desperado?

01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:21.473
- Put the gun down.
- I'm not goin' back.

01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:27.479
Jack, please, don't make me do this.
Put the gun down.

01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:34.950
Damn it, Jack, put the gun down!

01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:36.871
No more time-outs.

01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:48.394
You win, Jack.

01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:59.870
- I can't shoot you.
- You did. You shot me.

01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:02.070
You know what I mean.

01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:19.431
I'm sorry.
I wish things were different.

01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:02.631
Airport.

01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:32.309
Yeah, they don't know yet if they
want to bring him up on the homicides.

01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.119
I doubt if they will.
They'll just put a detainer on him.

01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.993
When they're through with him here,
he'll go back to Florida.

01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:40.310
Are you gonna go get him?

01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:42.516
Is possible. Why?

01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:44.431
Well, you know,
I was just thinkin'.

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:46.351
You can have a nice time
with him on the ride down,

01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:49.318
picking up where your interlude
or whatever you call it left off,

01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:52.079
and then you can throw him
in the shithouse.

01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:55.670
He knew what he was doing.

01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:58.513
Nobody forced him to rob banks.

01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:03.435
My little girl... the tough babe.

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:05.357
I'll call you later.

01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:07.470
Good-bye.

01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:26.310
Jack.

01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:30.631
I got you a present.

01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:35.276
Something for the road.

01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:51.197
I'm gonna have to take it away,
though, soon as the ride is over.

01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:06.158
Jack Foley?
Meet Hijirah Henry.

01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:18.277
What kind of a name is Hijirah?

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:21.676
- Is Islamic.
- Whas it stand for?

01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:25.030
The "Hijirah" was Mohammeďs
flight from Mecca in 622.

01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:29.358
- His flight?
- Brothers in Leavenworth
gave me that name.

01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:31.271
You were in Leavenworth, huh?

01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:34.193
- For a time.
- Meaning?

01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:37.192
- Meaning, time came, I left.
- You busted out.

01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:40.630
I prefer to think of it as an exodus
from an undesirable place.

01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:46.030
- How long before they
caught up with you?
- That time?

01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:51.437
- There were others?
- Yeah. That was the ninth.

01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:55.715
The ninth?

01:50:55.760 --> 01:50:59.435
Well, ten if you count that prison
hospital in Ohio I walked away from.

01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:02.153
- You done a lot of walkin', Henry.
- Hijirah.

01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:05.471
Hijirah.
Now we're off to Glades.

01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:09.513
Yeah, it looks that way.

01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:12.199
I was supposed to leave
last night with the lady marshal,

01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:15.471
but for some reason
she wanted to wait.

01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:19.269
- She did, huh?
- Guess is cheaper taking
two of us down in one van.

01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:24.388
Could be. Maybe she thought
we had a lot to talk about.

01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:26.431
Really? Like what?

01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:32.397
I don't know.
Long ride to Florida.

01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:49.318
Is your thing

01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:53.069

I can't tell ya

If you want me to love you
maybe I will

01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:12.915
Believe me, woman
it ain't no big deal

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.915
Ah, you need love now
just the same as I do

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:22.630
Makes me no difference now

Oh, give your love, girl
