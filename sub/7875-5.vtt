00:30.876 --> 00:33.754
Babe, you're having a bad dream.

00:34.338 --> 00:36.340
Jeff, you're having a bad dream.

00:36.507 --> 00:38.426
No, I'm not. You broke my arm.

00:38.634 --> 00:41.388
Oh, God. I had that dream again.

00:41.555 --> 00:44.099
And I think I finally know
what it means.

00:44.307 --> 00:45.976
You broke up with Jeff?

00:46.184 --> 00:48.437
It's time to change my entire life.

00:48.603 --> 00:50.772
That recurring dream's been trying
to tell me.

00:50.939 --> 00:53.775
The one where I'm in that
creepy classroom.

00:54.359 --> 00:57.654
What? I didn't drop that mug
because you mentioned that dream.

00:57.863 --> 00:59.448
That dream is a warning.

00:59.614 --> 01:01.951
Society's trying to brainwash me
to conform...

01:02.118 --> 01:05.455
...to color inside the lines,
to get married and have babies.

01:05.621 --> 01:07.498
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid anymore.

01:07.707 --> 01:09.625
Have you tried it with Splenda?

01:09.834 --> 01:12.754
Wait, Hayley. This'll take you
off the path to happiness.

01:12.962 --> 01:14.338
The path to happiness?

01:14.547 --> 01:17.508
Yeah, it starts in Marriage Land
and runs through Mommy Town.

01:17.675 --> 01:21.388
Final destination, Housewife City,
where you watch TV all day long...

01:21.555 --> 01:24.892
...and blame everything on a Mexican
woman who only comes on Tuesdays.

01:25.100 --> 01:27.144
Yeah, well,
I never want to be a housewife.

01:27.311 --> 01:28.979
That's why I'm moving to France.

01:29.188 --> 01:30.272
- What?
- What?

01:30.439 --> 01:33.066
I'm gonna live a carefree life with
a string of lovers.

01:33.233 --> 01:36.111
Jean-Jacques, Henri, Simone.

01:37.404 --> 01:38.906
The last one was a girl's name.

01:39.823 --> 01:40.950
I'm leaving tonight.

01:41.534 --> 01:42.744
Hayley, this is crazy.

01:42.911 --> 01:45.788
You're throwing your life away.
It's just a stupid dream.

01:45.997 --> 01:48.833
Sir, I have to tell her
it's not just a stupid dream.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.169
She needs to know about
Project Daycare.

01:51.336 --> 01:53.171
That you let her be brainwashed...

01:53.338 --> 01:55.507
...and trained as a sleeper agent
for the CIA?

01:55.673 --> 01:58.301
Oh, yes, that's sure
to put a puff in her petticoat.

01:58.468 --> 01:59.719
I never meant to hurt her.

01:59.886 --> 02:02.598
I thought it'd be fun to have
a father-daughter spy team.

02:02.765 --> 02:04.433
Yes, that does sound like fun.

02:04.600 --> 02:08.312
<i>But as we learned from Alias,
the idea gets tired very quickly.</i>

02:08.520 --> 02:12.066
Look, were you ever briefed on
why that project was discontinued?

02:12.274 --> 02:14.777
No, but I heard that the agents
not deactivated...

02:14.944 --> 02:17.321
...within seven days
lost their free will forever.

02:17.488 --> 02:19.198
Yes, something like that.

02:19.406 --> 02:20.950
Look, just do nothing.

02:21.117 --> 02:24.329
Hayley's training will simply
lie dormant in her subconscious...

02:24.496 --> 02:26.748
...as long as you never say
her trigger phrase.

02:26.915 --> 02:30.919
So, what, I just stand by
and watch my daughter ruin her life?

02:31.086 --> 02:34.464
I'm glad I'm not the only father
with a problem child.

02:34.631 --> 02:36.633
Smith, this is Senator Shepherd.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.260
He'll be joining us for lunch.

02:38.426 --> 02:40.762
Apparently, he won me in an auction.

02:40.971 --> 02:45.309
- So you have a willful daughter, too, sir?
- Willful, yes. Daughter, no.

02:45.518 --> 02:47.311
Your senator speaks in riddles.

02:47.478 --> 02:49.063
He has a son, Smith.

02:49.230 --> 02:50.439
That's not very funny.

02:53.567 --> 02:57.321
My God. You guys are still watching
that stupid sleuth channel?

02:57.530 --> 02:59.615
Are you kidding? This channel is great.

02:59.782 --> 03:01.576
It plays all the old detective shows:

03:01.743 --> 03:04.121
<i>Starsky and Hutch,
Jake and the Fatman.</i>

03:04.288 --> 03:07.833
It was a simpler time,
when only opposites could solve crimes.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.835
<i>This one's called Tex and Mex.</i>

03:10.002 --> 03:14.423
Tex is a bull-riding scientist,
Mex is a streetwise day laborer.

03:14.589 --> 03:16.883
They've assembled all the suspects
in the disco.

03:17.092 --> 03:20.721
<i>Okay, Trixie, you were doing the hustle
under the mirror ball...</i>

03:20.887 --> 03:22.390
<i>... and Bruno, you were...</i>

03:22.557 --> 03:26.728
<i>Hey, Mex! Put down that taco.
It's evidence.</i>

03:29.480 --> 03:32.150
Best catch phrase ever.

03:32.358 --> 03:34.068
<i>Didi went on break at midnight...</i>

03:34.235 --> 03:38.031
<i>... which means the victim
got her cocktail directly at the bar.</i>

03:38.197 --> 03:39.282
<i>From Bruno.</i>

03:39.490 --> 03:41.118
<i>You said the poison was fast.</i>

03:41.285 --> 03:43.787
<i>She didn 't die for an hour.
It couldn 't have been me.</i>

03:43.996 --> 03:46.915
Unless the poison
was frozen in the ice cubes.

03:47.124 --> 03:49.835
<i>Unless the poison
was frozen in the ice cubes.</i>

03:50.044 --> 03:53.005
- We would have made great detectives.
- "Would have"?

03:53.172 --> 03:55.132
Let's start our own detective agency.

03:55.340 --> 03:57.134
Yeah! What should our names be?

03:57.301 --> 04:01.473
Steve, first you create the character,
then let him tell you his name.

04:01.639 --> 04:04.934
- Meet here in an hour with our personas.
- Deal.

04:05.101 --> 04:10.106
In the meantime,
I'm gonna crack my first case.

04:10.732 --> 04:12.192
Whatever Steve's persona is...

04:12.358 --> 04:15.445
...I hope it involves rolling his eyes
at my clever puns.

04:18.197 --> 04:21.075
I tell you, my son has me at my limit.

04:21.285 --> 04:25.331
All he wants to do is travel the world,
sowing his wild oats.

04:25.498 --> 04:27.792
I just want him to get on the road
to happiness.

04:27.958 --> 04:29.627
The path to happiness. But me too.

04:29.794 --> 04:31.879
If only there was a way
to control our kids.

04:32.046 --> 04:35.007
Well, I've figured out how
to control mine. Money.

04:35.174 --> 04:39.845
I told Dill he's not getting a dime until
he finds himself a gal and settles down.

04:40.012 --> 04:43.225
Maybe our kids could settle down
together. What's your son like?

04:43.391 --> 04:44.851
You can see for yourself.

04:45.018 --> 04:48.730
If I know Dill, he's at the gym right now,
working up a sweat.

04:51.608 --> 04:53.860
It's a nice day for a stroll.

04:54.069 --> 04:56.196
And the view is just fine too.

04:56.404 --> 04:58.406
Anyway, as I was saying, Mr. Smith...

04:58.573 --> 05:02.620
...after college, I found myself afflicted
by a wanderlust...

05:02.787 --> 05:04.956
...that took me round the globe...

05:05.122 --> 05:09.126
...where I feasted on
the sweet sticky nectar of life.

05:09.961 --> 05:11.295
But then Father called...

05:11.462 --> 05:16.717
...and I had to flutter back
to the nest like a wayward jaybird.

05:17.468 --> 05:19.303
He's perfect.

05:22.057 --> 05:25.394
Roger, you ready for my persona?

05:26.103 --> 05:29.439
- What do you think?
- I don't love it.

05:29.940 --> 05:32.818
- What are you doing in a wheelchair?
- I'm Wheels.

05:32.985 --> 05:36.655
Together we're Wheels and the Legman.
You're the Legman.

05:36.822 --> 05:39.366
How can I be the Legman
if I'm in a wheelchair?

05:39.533 --> 05:41.619
So you see the problem.
Nice detective work.

05:41.786 --> 05:44.289
- Get out of that thing. You're ridiculous.
- I can't.

05:44.455 --> 05:47.542
- I was a cop who got shot.
- You got shot? That's it?

05:47.709 --> 05:49.669
Oh, I suppose you have a better story.

05:49.877 --> 05:53.339
My name is Braff Zacklin.
I was an international racecar driver.

05:53.506 --> 05:56.009
One day, a baby carriage rolled out
onto the track...

05:56.175 --> 05:58.720
...so I swerved into the retaining wall
to avoid it.

05:58.886 --> 06:02.391
The car burst into flames,
but the baby miraculously survived.

06:02.558 --> 06:04.310
I was that baby.

06:04.518 --> 06:07.313
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I'm Braff Zacklin!

06:07.771 --> 06:10.482
<i>Flight 22 to Paris now boarding.</i>

06:10.649 --> 06:13.861
Hayley, wait.
Meet the man of your dreams.

06:14.028 --> 06:17.197
Dill Shepherd.
Charmed, I'm entirely certain.

06:17.781 --> 06:19.074
Would you excuse us?

06:19.283 --> 06:21.369
I'll just mosey on over
to the men's room...

06:21.536 --> 06:23.955
...and see if I can't find
a willing foreigner...

06:24.122 --> 06:27.125
...to help me check the sturdiness
of the diaper-change table.

06:28.543 --> 06:33.631
He's already got babies on the brain.
Talk about husband material.

06:33.798 --> 06:36.384
I'm pretty sure I'm not his type.

06:36.551 --> 06:38.303
- Bye, Daddy.
- Hayley, wait.

06:38.470 --> 06:40.638
You're making a huge mistake.
I won't let you.

06:40.805 --> 06:44.143
You won't let me?
It's my life, you can't control me.

06:44.352 --> 06:47.063
Yes, I could.
I could control you completely...

06:47.229 --> 06:49.732
...just by saying one secret combination
of words...

06:49.899 --> 06:51.776
...no one in the world would
ever utter.

06:51.984 --> 06:53.694
Goodbye, Dad.

06:53.903 --> 06:55.780
Hayley!

06:55.988 --> 06:59.033
I'm getting fed up with this orgasm.

06:59.492 --> 07:02.204
Agent Small Wonder activated.
What are my orders?

07:02.412 --> 07:03.663
It worked.

07:05.874 --> 07:07.459
Tear up your plane ticket.

07:07.626 --> 07:09.336
Are we almost finished here?

07:09.503 --> 07:13.215
Hayley, take the hand
of your new boyfriend, Dill.

07:13.757 --> 07:16.510
Look aroused.
Ten percent more aroused.

07:16.676 --> 07:18.637
Scale it back 2 percent.

07:19.971 --> 07:21.223
Young love.

07:26.020 --> 07:27.563
Ding-dong.

07:27.730 --> 07:31.442
Francine, someone's mimicking
the doorbell.

07:32.735 --> 07:35.530
Hi, Dill. Oh, you brought flowers
for Hayley.

07:35.696 --> 07:39.200
No. These are for me.
They're my walking petunias.

07:39.367 --> 07:43.288
There he is. Dill.

07:43.539 --> 07:45.958
Fifteen-hundred hours.
Ready to go as instructed.

07:46.124 --> 07:48.627
Hayley, you're wearing a dress?

07:48.794 --> 07:50.546
She looks great in it. Don't you?

07:50.754 --> 07:51.922
Yes, I look great in it.

07:52.130 --> 07:53.507
Conceited.

07:53.715 --> 07:55.717
- Should take a sweater.
- I don't need one.

07:55.884 --> 07:58.720
- Take a sweater, Hayley.
- I'll go get a sweater.

07:58.929 --> 08:02.892
Your daughter is as nimble
as Johnny Yip, a Taiwanese gymnast...

08:03.059 --> 08:07.063
...with whom I once had the pleasure
of sharing an Italian sleeper car.

08:07.272 --> 08:10.233
Yeah, that fumble totally
handed the game to the Redskins.

08:10.400 --> 08:14.445
- Dill, can you give us a minute?
- Surely.

08:15.071 --> 08:16.906
Stan, what's going on with Hayley?

08:17.073 --> 08:19.325
It's like she's just going
through the motions.

08:19.492 --> 08:21.327
She doesn't really seem happy.

08:21.495 --> 08:23.956
You're happy, right?
Tell your mother you're happy.

08:24.123 --> 08:26.792
- Mother, I'm happy.
- See? She's over the moon.

08:26.959 --> 08:30.296
Well, I don't know as much about
astronomy as you...

08:30.462 --> 08:33.465
...but I'm worried about our little girl.

08:33.881 --> 08:36.677
Klaus, I think I might have done
a bad thing.

08:36.844 --> 08:40.306
I kind of brainwashed Hayley.

08:41.222 --> 08:43.018
Yeah, I'm sort of reading.

08:43.183 --> 08:46.354
She's a sleeper agent
and, well, I activated her.

08:46.521 --> 08:48.773
She'll do whatever I tell her.

08:50.233 --> 08:55.155
Of course, I feel terrible about taking
away her ability to think for herself.

08:57.866 --> 08:59.701
But it's only for seven days.

08:59.868 --> 09:02.705
Then I have to deactivate her
or she'll lose her free will.

09:02.872 --> 09:05.583
So I've only got until Saturday
at 7:35...

09:05.750 --> 09:09.337
...to make sure she stays
on the path to happiness.

09:11.130 --> 09:13.591
I know it seems wrong,
but it's for her own good.

09:13.758 --> 09:15.926
So that's okay, right?
What do you think?

09:16.469 --> 09:19.930
I think you only talk to me
when there's no one else to turn to.

09:20.097 --> 09:23.310
You don't care what I think.
You just need to hear yourself talk.

09:23.477 --> 09:27.689
I think you're a selfish bastard
and I think you can go to hell.

09:30.442 --> 09:33.862
Okay. Well, I guess
I'll ask someone else what they...

09:34.029 --> 09:36.406
Yes, why don't you do that?

09:37.991 --> 09:40.535
Good for you, Klaus. Good for you.

09:42.872 --> 09:46.709
Now, if we were to hire you as
the secretary of our detective agency...

09:46.876 --> 09:49.712
...what wacky yet lovable persona
would you employ?

09:49.921 --> 09:52.131
L... I don't know what you mean.

09:52.340 --> 09:54.926
Like answering the phone
with dirty limericks...

09:55.093 --> 09:57.929
...or constantly talking to the ghost
of your dead husband.

09:58.096 --> 09:59.389
What the Legman means is...

09:59.555 --> 10:01.517
Excuse me, I'm Wheels,
you're the Legman.

10:01.683 --> 10:04.978
I dare you to stand up
and tell me that.

10:05.270 --> 10:07.064
Nice try.

10:08.023 --> 10:10.526
I have three kids. Is this a real job?

10:10.734 --> 10:13.153
Shut up. Look,
we can't be Wheels and Wheels.

10:13.320 --> 10:15.906
The ABC story department
would never approve that.

10:16.073 --> 10:18.742
Either you be my Legman
or I'll find a partner who will.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.953
Fine. Me too.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.416
I don't have time for this bit.

10:30.421 --> 10:34.259
Thank God you're home.
Something weird is going on, Stan.

10:34.425 --> 10:37.178
Hayley's become
a totally different person.

10:37.345 --> 10:41.349
It's almost as if something's
been done to her brain.

10:41.517 --> 10:45.479
Like her brain's been put through
some sort of cleaning process.

10:45.646 --> 10:51.902
Like it's been scrubbed or rubbed
vigorously with soap and water.

10:52.069 --> 10:57.032
Brain scoured? Mind polished?

10:57.825 --> 10:59.493
Well, something fishy's going on...

10:59.660 --> 11:02.372
...and I'm not gonna rest until
I find out exactly what...

11:02.539 --> 11:04.958
I'm engaged.

11:05.125 --> 11:07.836
My baby's getting married!

11:09.087 --> 11:10.881
I can't believe Dill proposed.

11:11.047 --> 11:13.133
He didn't. I did.
Those were my orders.

11:13.300 --> 11:14.926
Orders? What do you...?

11:15.093 --> 11:17.804
Oh, who cares?
You're getting married!

11:17.971 --> 11:22.894
We'll have a big fancy wedding
with doves and napkins.

11:23.060 --> 11:26.063
Make sure the wedding happens
by Saturday at 7:35.

11:26.230 --> 11:28.816
What? But that's four days away.

11:28.983 --> 11:31.569
Wait, why would it have
to happen by...?

11:31.736 --> 11:36.532
Oh, who cares?
My baby's getting married!

11:36.824 --> 11:39.660
I know, I know. This seems extreme,
but time's running out.

11:39.827 --> 11:41.997
Come on, Klaus, I need you. L...

11:42.164 --> 11:45.250
- Is that a new bowl?
- No. It was new three weeks ago.

11:45.417 --> 11:47.419
- I didn't notice.
- No, you didn't.

11:47.586 --> 11:50.464
It's very nice. Really.

11:50.631 --> 11:52.466
Makes you look thinner.

11:52.633 --> 11:54.384
Well, thank you.

11:54.551 --> 11:57.888
I guess I forget sometimes
that you're not just a fish in a bowl.

11:58.055 --> 11:59.765
You're a man in a fish in a bowl.

11:59.931 --> 12:05.897
Maybe I could be a friend in a fish
in a bowl.

12:06.648 --> 12:08.900
Stan, I know your heart's
in the right place...

12:09.067 --> 12:10.818
...but when you deactivate Hayley...

12:10.985 --> 12:14.113
...do you really think she'll live with
the choices you've made?

12:14.280 --> 12:18.368
That's the thing. After I deactivate her,
she'll think all of my choices were hers.

12:18.534 --> 12:22.206
She'll be married to a rich senator's son,
on her way to motherhood.

12:22.373 --> 12:24.124
Can I ask you something?

12:24.291 --> 12:27.086
- You know, as a friend?
- Sure.

12:27.252 --> 12:29.129
Can you teach me how to read?

12:33.801 --> 12:35.761
- Oh, hello.
- Hi, there.

12:35.928 --> 12:37.888
Allow me to introduce ourselves.

12:38.055 --> 12:41.266
Wheels and the Legman.

12:41.433 --> 12:44.562
Bill Elliott. 25 years of PI experience.

12:44.729 --> 12:47.232
Mostly divorce cases
and insurance fraud.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.609
He's the real deal, Braff.

12:49.818 --> 12:52.320
Allow me to introduce ourselves.

12:52.487 --> 12:56.282
Wheels and the Angel.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.327
That's right, a real angel.

12:59.494 --> 13:03.207
And she can't get back into heaven
until she solves 100 cases.

13:03.416 --> 13:06.085
But that... But you... But she...

13:06.252 --> 13:08.879
That's brilliant.

13:10.673 --> 13:14.468
Thank you, Dill, for that lovely poem
dedicated to your best man.

13:18.472 --> 13:22.144
Stan, you have to deactivate her
or she'll be your puppet forever.

13:22.352 --> 13:26.106
Do you, Dill, take Hayley
to be your lawfully wedded wife...

13:26.314 --> 13:27.983
...in sickness and in health?

13:28.400 --> 13:29.609
I do.

13:29.818 --> 13:32.028
- You're running out of time.
- Come on.

13:32.237 --> 13:35.615
And Hayley, do you take this,
let's say man...

13:35.782 --> 13:37.909
...to be your lawfully wedded
husband?

13:38.118 --> 13:41.538
- Stan, it's now or never.
- We can still make it.

13:41.747 --> 13:44.417
- I do.
- I'm getting fed up with this orgasm.

13:44.834 --> 13:46.335
What are your orders, Father?

13:47.795 --> 13:50.006
Nothing. Please continue.

13:50.798 --> 13:52.049
I was too late.

13:52.258 --> 13:54.177
Okay, then, you're married.

13:54.343 --> 13:55.553
Good luck with that.

13:55.720 --> 13:57.138
You may now kiss the bride.

13:57.305 --> 13:59.557
Is it mandatory?

14:03.187 --> 14:05.314
- Hayley, your mom wants a picture.
- Not now.

14:05.480 --> 14:08.692
Hayley, I order you
to come take a picture.

14:08.901 --> 14:10.485
Not now.

14:11.737 --> 14:15.574
But seriously, Amy,
age ain't nothing but a number.

14:15.741 --> 14:20.078
And the number I'm thinking of
is $ 100.

14:20.621 --> 14:22.665
My, how courting has changed.

14:22.832 --> 14:24.500
Smith, lovely wedding.

14:25.001 --> 14:26.920
Sir, I need to know the whole story...

14:27.086 --> 14:29.130
...about why Project Daycare
was cancelled.

14:29.339 --> 14:31.549
Why, because of all the deaths,
of course.

14:33.259 --> 14:36.095
Good God. You did it.
You activated your daughter.

14:36.262 --> 14:38.139
Look, sir, I know you're mad, but...

14:38.348 --> 14:40.433
Deactivate her now.

14:40.642 --> 14:43.312
- I can't, it's been over seven days.
- What?

14:43.520 --> 14:44.605
I'm kind of worried.

14:44.772 --> 14:47.232
I thought she was
supposed to lose her free will...

14:47.399 --> 14:50.110
...but I just gave her an order
and she didn't...

14:52.780 --> 14:55.574
Smith, get the hell out of there.
Green Taurus, chop-chop.

14:55.741 --> 14:57.910
The problem isn't that
she'll lose free will.

14:58.077 --> 15:00.120
She's going to turn on her handler.

15:00.287 --> 15:01.705
But I'm her handler.

15:01.873 --> 15:03.875
No! A green Taurus.

15:05.752 --> 15:09.255
Smith, Hayley was trained
to be an unstoppable killing machine...

15:09.422 --> 15:12.926
...and she won't snap out of it
until you're dead.

15:15.553 --> 15:18.348
Okay, everyone,
we're gonna cut the cake.

15:18.556 --> 15:20.433
Come on, Hayley, cut the cake.

15:20.642 --> 15:24.605
I just wanna make sure
Daddy sees this.

15:24.814 --> 15:28.192
Oh, yeah, I see it.
I can see fine from back here.

15:34.073 --> 15:37.118
And now it's time for the bride
to dance with her father.

15:37.326 --> 15:40.329
Oh, I would,
but I have to tip the dove guy.

15:44.543 --> 15:47.045
Hayley, I just want you to know,
everything I did...

15:47.212 --> 15:49.297
...I did because I wanted
to make you happy.

15:49.464 --> 15:55.512
I am happy, Dad. I'm not just gaining
a husband, I'm losing a father.

15:57.222 --> 16:01.768
So after she died in Hurricane Katrina,
she was sent down to walk the earth...

16:01.936 --> 16:04.814
...and change people's lives
for the better.

16:04.981 --> 16:07.608
- Angel, tell him your catch phrase.
- Gonna finish that?

16:07.775 --> 16:10.153
We're still working on a catch phrase.

16:10.319 --> 16:14.615
Wait a minute. What kind of angel
eats devil's food cake?

16:14.782 --> 16:17.410
- We have to go now.
- Nobody's going anywhere.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.872
Something about this angel
stinks to high heaven.

16:22.166 --> 16:23.792
Very nice.

16:23.959 --> 16:25.711
- You're crazy.
- Am I?

16:25.878 --> 16:29.298
You almost got away with it,
but nothing gets past Wheels.

16:29.465 --> 16:32.342
Especially not people walking behind me
in a narrow hallway.

16:32.509 --> 16:36.805
My first clue that something was amiss
was when Angel asked me:

16:36.972 --> 16:38.307
"Are you gonna finish that?"

16:38.474 --> 16:40.517
<i>At that moment, I thought to myself:</i>

16:40.684 --> 16:44.272
Wait a minute. What kind of angel
eats devil's food cake?

16:44.439 --> 16:47.358
She's no angel. She's a fraud.

16:50.653 --> 16:55.366
Congratulations, you cracked the case,
Wheels.

16:55.909 --> 16:58.786
- Say it now.
- You're on a roll, Wheels.

16:58.953 --> 17:01.206
Great. Now laugh and freeze-frame.

17:06.587 --> 17:07.755
You can walk?

17:07.922 --> 17:10.215
Doesn't this remind you
of that ballroom skit...

17:10.382 --> 17:13.176
<i>...on The Muppet Show
when they'd dance and tell jokes?</i>

17:13.344 --> 17:15.179
Yeah. Except I'm going to kill you.

17:15.346 --> 17:17.640
Jewish chair dance.

17:22.896 --> 17:24.396
Damn it!

17:51.717 --> 17:53.719
416 Cherry Street. Go.

18:08.860 --> 18:10.070
Gun! Call for help.

19:15.847 --> 19:17.640
Hayley, don't make me...

19:17.807 --> 19:20.643
Spare your life,
because you're part of the family.

19:30.154 --> 19:33.741
There's gotta be something in here
that'll snap her out of it.

19:37.870 --> 19:39.163
Wait. Stop.

19:39.330 --> 19:42.501
Remember when you had the chickenpox
and I gave you this bear?

19:43.543 --> 19:45.504
Congratulations, you did it.

19:45.670 --> 19:48.256
Mr. Teddy Bonkers was your handler
and you killed him.

19:48.423 --> 19:51.343
Mission accomplished. Fuddruckers?

19:52.552 --> 19:55.096
Okay, Hayley, I give up.

19:55.263 --> 19:56.765
This was all my fault.

19:56.932 --> 19:58.892
I never should have tried
to control you.

19:59.059 --> 20:01.353
You were on your own path
to happiness...

20:01.520 --> 20:05.066
...and if killing me will put you back on
that path, then go ahead.

20:05.233 --> 20:08.277
Just know that I love you
and I always will.

20:08.444 --> 20:09.820
You're my little girl.

20:09.987 --> 20:12.156
If you still feel
you can pull that trigger...

20:16.494 --> 20:18.371
Stan! Are you okay?

20:18.537 --> 20:21.582
Yeah. I just had a dream that
I was dead.

20:21.749 --> 20:24.419
You were, for six whole minutes.

20:24.586 --> 20:26.964
- What?
- I'm so sorry, Daddy.

20:27.172 --> 20:28.799
I guess I was just so stressed...

20:28.966 --> 20:31.677
...rushing into that stupid wedding
with that gay guy.

20:31.843 --> 20:32.970
I just went crazy.

20:33.136 --> 20:34.930
Don't worry, she's much better now.

20:35.097 --> 20:38.350
We had the marriage annulled
and everything's back to normal.

20:38.517 --> 20:39.768
Kitchen's kind of a mess.

20:39.935 --> 20:41.395
Can you ever forgive me?

20:41.603 --> 20:44.565
So nobody knows why any
of this happened?

20:44.774 --> 20:46.901
- No.
- Then yes, I can forgive you.

20:47.068 --> 20:48.611
I'm just glad you're okay, Dad.

20:48.778 --> 20:50.488
Hayley, your mother was right.

20:50.697 --> 20:54.033
You're a strong, independent young lady
and I'm proud of you.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.911
And if you wanna go to France,
I support you.

20:57.120 --> 21:00.707
I don't know. For some reason, I feel
like I got all that out of my system.

21:00.915 --> 21:04.086
Man, I can't believe I survived
a shot to the head.

21:04.295 --> 21:06.797
Well, the doctor says
you'll have some memory loss...

21:06.964 --> 21:11.427
...but I'll be by your side through
every step of your recovery, my friend.

21:12.177 --> 21:14.430
Who's the talking fish?

21:50.843 --> 21:52.928
