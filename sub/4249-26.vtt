08:33.511 --> 08:35.181
WELL,
HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS?

I EVEN KNEW YOU HAD AN
IMAGINARY DOG CALLED SNIFFLES.

OKAY, SNIFFLES WAS INVISIBLE,
NOT IMAGINARY.

08:41.812 --> 08:44.273

AND ENJOY YOURSELF.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.826
NO BIGGIE.

- OH, SO HE'S TOO BUSY DREAMING
ABOUT HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND.

09:19.850 --> 09:22.311
- MAYBE YOU JUST NEED
TO UP YOUR GAME.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.481
DON'T JUST LET HIM KNOW
THAT YOU ARE SEEING SOMEONE.

09:25.564 --> 09:27.400
SHOW HIM.

09:27.483 --> 09:28.359
- SHOW HIM?

09:28.442 --> 09:30.903
- MORE THAN JUST ONE PHOTO.

09:30.987 --> 09:36.325
I THINK HE REALLY OUGHT TO KNOW
ABOUT THE FUN, AMAZING,

THAT WE HAVE BEEN ON.

10:11.152 --> 10:15.156

YOU SHOULD DROP OUT OF THE AD.

10:15.239 --> 10:17.616
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

10:17.700 --> 10:19.910
THIS COULD BE MY BIG BREAK,
MY ONE SHOT AT STARDOM.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.705
- YEAH, BUT IF PEOPLE START TO
REALIZE WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU,

10:22.788 --> 10:25.207
THERE'S GONNA BE ALL SORTS
OF QUESTIONS

10:25.291 --> 10:26.542
THAT WE JUST CAN'T ANSWER.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.878

BETWEEN PERSONAL FAME
