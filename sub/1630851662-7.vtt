00:29.529 --> 00:30.905
[A'ashenn 1] Only made
it worse...

00:30.989 --> 00:32.115
[A'ashenn 2] More hunted now
than ever...

00:32.198 --> 00:33.450
[A'ashenn 3] Nowhere is safe...

00:33.533 --> 00:34.951
[A'ashenn 4] Are we
still Ma'alefa'ak?

00:35.034 --> 00:36.077
[Ma'alefa'ak] Hear me,
brothers and sisters.

00:36.161 --> 00:38.037
Yes, our gene bomb failed.

00:38.121 --> 00:42.459
But the terror we spread
among the G'arrunns
and B'lahdenns is a victory.

00:42.542 --> 00:47.422
And soon enough, the jaws
of the Ma'alefa'ak
will close upon their throats--

00:47.505 --> 00:49.007
-[crashing]
-[all gasp]

00:59.601 --> 01:02.103
How? Why?

01:02.187 --> 01:05.982
The G'arrunns and B'lahdenns
reap what they've sown,
sister.

01:06.065 --> 01:08.067
They are lucky
to have survived.

01:08.151 --> 01:11.070
Not the G'arrunns, Conner!

01:11.154 --> 01:15.366
This rage is for him?
For a mere earther?

01:15.450 --> 01:19.412
Don't pretend you don't know
what he was.

01:19.496 --> 01:23.917
You used Kryptonite
to kill him.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.169
I don't even know
what Kryptonite is.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.587
Liar.

01:27.670 --> 01:32.675
Read my thoughts.
M'gann, I am not lying.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.894
You're not lying.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.031
He was telling the truth,

01:55.114 --> 01:59.702
But now... [sobbing]

01:59.786 --> 02:02.163
Who do I blame?

02:04.040 --> 02:05.542
Who do I blame?

02:06.876 --> 02:08.336
[sobbing]

02:12.507 --> 02:14.634
[theme music playing]

02:49.335 --> 02:56.050
[Tigress]<i> In olden times</i>
<i>there was a barbaric king</i>
<i>in a barbaric kingdom.</i>

02:56.134 --> 02:59.429
<i>He had a daughter he loved,</i>
<i>and absolute power</i>

02:59.512 --> 03:03.224
<i>over everyone he ruled,</i>
<i>including her.</i>

03:03.308 --> 03:04.726
When I ran from my father,

03:04.809 --> 03:07.937
I swear, I never meant
for any of this to happen.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.900
As soon as we reach
Santa Prisca,
you must trade me for Orphan.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.276
That's not how we do things.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.153
You are coming to help me.
rescue Orphan.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.196
-I know but--
-You wanna be free
of the Shadows?

03:17.280 --> 03:19.365
First, stop thinking like one.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.743
My team does not leave
anyone behind.

03:21.826 --> 03:24.412
You made the offer
knowing she'd turn you down.

03:24.495 --> 03:29.250
And you attack my integrity
knowing it will sabotage
my chances with Tigress.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.127
Cut it out, both of you!

03:31.210 --> 03:34.130
We all have to work together
to get Orphan back.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.639
[Oracle]<i> A fine sentiment,</i>
<i>but the facts don't back it up.</i>

03:42.722 --> 03:45.016
The lead computer
in Green Arrow's vault
was breached.

03:45.099 --> 03:48.978
One of those two has the data
and is using you to carry it
to the Shadows

03:49.062 --> 03:51.105
You're riding with
at least one traitor.

03:51.189 --> 03:54.150
<i>Bruce, Dick, Tim, Kate</i>
<i>and Stephanie are cowl deep</i>

03:56.235 --> 03:59.614
But Orphan's one of us.
And after Jason...

03:59.697 --> 04:03.534
Well, say the word and you'll
have the entire Bat family

04:03.618 --> 04:04.994
<i>en route to Santa Prisca.</i>

04:06.913 --> 04:08.998
<i>Okay, but you better be right.</i>

04:10.083 --> 04:12.543
<i>We have to get Orphan back.</i>

04:20.510 --> 04:21.928
Good to have you home.

04:22.845 --> 04:23.972
My daughter.

04:26.599 --> 04:31.270
I am very disappointed in you,
and not a little perplexed.

04:31.354 --> 04:35.650
You were never just a Shadow
in training, not to me.

04:35.733 --> 04:38.194
I molded you
into the perfect assassin,

04:38.277 --> 04:42.699
shaped you to reach a potential
beyond even my grasp.

04:42.782 --> 04:48.037
And I sent you
on a simple mission.
Child's play for you.

04:48.121 --> 04:52.667
And not only did you fail,
you turned against us.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.503
Against me.

04:55.586 --> 04:58.131
To cower in the embrace
of the enemy.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.428
<i>You were the silent blade.</i>

05:04.887 --> 05:06.931
<i>The soul of Shadow.</i>

05:07.682 --> 05:09.976
Death made flesh.

05:11.269 --> 05:14.063
You are ready.

05:14.147 --> 05:19.277
Your first target
was once considered
a useful asset to the Light.

05:19.360 --> 05:23.239
But no longer. He sent
Vandal Savage this recording.

05:24.198 --> 05:26.868
[laughs obnoxiously]

05:38.504 --> 05:41.174
<i>The League has accounted</i>
<i>for all known Kryptonite</i>
<i>on Earth</i>

05:41.257 --> 05:44.218
<i>and in the Milky Way galaxy.</i>
<i>None is missing.</i>

05:44.302 --> 05:48.014
Which does not mean
there was not more out there
to be found.

05:48.097 --> 05:51.809
<i>True, but it does mean</i>
<i>we're out of leads.</i>

05:51.893 --> 05:54.520
<i>I'm sorry, J'onn. Believe me.</i>

05:54.604 --> 05:57.273
As am I, Shayera.

05:57.356 --> 05:58.608
Signing off.

06:11.829 --> 06:15.333
[Tigress]<i> The barbarian king</i>
<i>had won his crown in battle.</i>

06:16.667 --> 06:20.129
<i>He would hold it</i>
<i>through subtler means.</i>

06:20.213 --> 06:24.133
<i>He had his own rules,</i>
<i>his own laws.</i>

06:24.217 --> 06:25.843
<i>And when</i>
<i>any of these were broken,</i>

06:25.927 --> 06:29.847
<i>he had his own ideas</i>
<i>of justice.</i>

06:29.931 --> 06:32.558
<i>If a man defied the laws</i>
<i>of the king,</i>

06:32.642 --> 06:38.147
<i>he was taken to a huge arena,</i>
<i>in order to decide</i>
<i>his own fate.</i>

06:38.231 --> 06:42.026
<i>There he faced</i>
<i>two identical doors.</i>

06:42.110 --> 06:48.116
<i>Behind one, a ravenous tiger</i>
<i>that would destroy him</i>
<i>on sight.</i>

06:48.199 --> 06:55.790
<i>Behind the other, a lovely lady</i>
<i>who would immediately</i>
<i>marry him.</i>

06:55.873 --> 07:00.419
<i>Chance and his choosing</i>
<i>would be his judge and jury.</i>

07:13.099 --> 07:15.268
<i>It came to pass</i>
<i>that the king's daughter</i>

07:15.351 --> 07:18.729
<i>fell in love</i>
<i>with a handsome commoner.</i>

07:18.813 --> 07:20.273
<i>This was forbidden.</i>

07:20.356 --> 07:23.359
<i>So the young man found himself</i>
<i>facing the two doors.</i>

07:23.442 --> 07:28.406
<i>The princess learned which door</i>
<i>held the slavering tiger,</i>

07:28.489 --> 07:31.909
<i>and which the simpering maid.</i>

07:31.993 --> 07:35.621
<i>-But would the princess</i>
<i>save her man?</i>
-[gasps]

07:35.705 --> 07:40.918
<i>For she was</i>
<i>as jealous of the man</i>
<i>as she was in love with him.</i>

07:41.002 --> 07:45.590
<i>When she secretly</i>
<i>pointed to the door</i>
<i>her lover should choose,</i>

07:45.673 --> 07:49.093
<i>he trusted her and opened it.</i>

07:49.177 --> 07:52.471
<i>But which option did</i>
<i>the princess choose</i>
<i>for her man?</i>

07:53.347 --> 07:56.726
<i>The lady or the tiger?</i>

07:56.809 --> 07:59.145
[Oracle]<i> I know</i>
<i>you saw that last Shadow.</i>

07:59.228 --> 08:01.063
<i>So were you testing them?</i>

08:01.147 --> 08:04.066
When these three don't call in,
Shiva will know we're here

08:04.150 --> 08:05.651
and that we made her deadline.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.695
Not what she had in mind

08:07.778 --> 08:09.822
Yet it's what she'd expect.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.282
She'll honor the deal.

08:11.365 --> 08:12.783
Orphan is safe for now.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.452
But we're on the wrong side
of the island.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.412
It'll be light before we get
where we're going.

08:16.495 --> 08:18.831
Then we'll find a rabbit hole
to wait out the day.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.249
[Oracle]<i> You better know</i>
<i>what you're doing.</i>

08:20.333 --> 08:22.376
-Take point.
-[Oracle]<i> Roger that.</i>

08:22.460 --> 08:25.379
-[Onyx] Both of us?
-[sighs] Why not?

08:25.463 --> 08:27.215
Now you're getting the idea.

08:29.508 --> 08:33.429
[Tigress]<i> For each door</i>
<i>holds both results</i>

08:33.512 --> 08:35.848
<i>right up until the moment</i>
<i>it's opened.</i>

08:41.270 --> 08:43.439
Section 16 has gone dark.

08:43.522 --> 08:46.317
Either you changed
the corporate vacation policy,

08:46.400 --> 08:47.985
or our guests are here.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.947
Which means
the League's data's here
as well.

08:51.030 --> 08:54.992
Tigress will take her time,
I imagine. Still...

08:55.076 --> 08:56.744
Shade, bring the vessel.

08:56.827 --> 08:58.079
Time to hunt?

08:58.162 --> 09:02.041
There's no point.
Our quarry will come to us

09:02.124 --> 09:05.670
to trade one Cassandra
for another.

09:05.753 --> 09:08.130
Of course,
they'll try to keep both.

09:08.214 --> 09:11.759
And of course,
we will allow them
to keep neither.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.887
I see that look in your eyes.

09:14.971 --> 09:20.351
Yes, the Light has long coveted
the Justice League's
intelligence.

09:20.434 --> 09:25.022
But make no mistake,
I was there for you.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.483
I wanted to give my Cassandra

09:27.567 --> 09:30.486
a second chance
to fulfill her destiny.

09:33.739 --> 09:37.243
[Joker laughing]

09:37.326 --> 09:40.538
<i>Hey there, Mr. Savage.</i>

09:40.621 --> 09:45.626
Sorry to call so late.
Eight years late.

09:45.710 --> 09:49.213
But I only just heard it
through the grapevine. See?

09:49.297 --> 09:54.385
Have to admit this revelation
has somewhat poisoned

09:54.468 --> 09:57.346
my relationship
with you and yours.

09:57.430 --> 10:02.143
<i>Which, come to think of it,</i>
<i>might be exactly why</i>
<i>little Miss Poison Ivy,</i>

10:02.226 --> 10:04.353
<i>spilled the beans.</i>

10:04.437 --> 10:05.938
Or whatever grows
on grapevines.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.065
I'm not a horticulturist,
you know,

10:08.149 --> 10:11.444
just a simple, fun loving fiend

10:11.527 --> 10:16.615
apparently undeserving
of your full respect.

10:16.699 --> 10:19.201
For I'm told,
the Injustice League

10:19.285 --> 10:23.456
was nothing but a ruse,
a puppet show.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.249
Wax fruit.

10:25.333 --> 10:30.880
Something to keep the high
and mighty Light
in the shadows.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.381
[crashing]

10:32.465 --> 10:34.383
And I'm the only one

10:35.134 --> 10:37.053
who didn't know.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.847
I mean, Riddler knew?

10:39.930 --> 10:41.557
Riddler!

10:41.640 --> 10:44.685
[sighs] Oh. Good versus bad.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.979
Bad versus good.

10:47.063 --> 10:50.566
And your old pal Joker
caught in the crossfire

10:50.649 --> 10:53.444
of all your senseless violence.

10:53.527 --> 10:56.989
And that's
the worst sin of all.

10:57.073 --> 11:01.452
Because senseless violence
is my gag.

11:01.535 --> 11:04.705
You stole my punchline, Vandy.

11:04.789 --> 11:09.126
Made me,
<i>me</i> the butt of your joke.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.920
<i>But not to worry.</i>

11:11.003 --> 11:12.463
<i>I've got a new routine</i>

11:12.546 --> 11:15.925
<i>sure to entertain</i>
<i>the good guys and the bad.</i>

11:16.008 --> 11:19.512
I'm telling you, Vandy,
I think this act

11:19.595 --> 11:22.765
will just slay.

11:22.848 --> 11:27.353
And since apparently
you're all such big
Riddler fans,

11:27.436 --> 11:30.439
here's a page
out of his feeble book.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.066
[clears throat]

11:32.149 --> 11:35.653
My revenge will be untimely,

11:35.736 --> 11:40.408
uncomfortable, and unfortunate.

11:40.491 --> 11:44.453
<i>Un. Get it, huh? U.N.</i>

11:44.537 --> 11:46.539
[Joker laughs hysterically]

11:49.708 --> 11:52.795
Ain't it grand
how the fear of death

11:52.878 --> 11:58.008
and Joker venom
brings every nation together?

11:58.092 --> 11:59.969
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.972
But take note, Mr. Secretary.

12:03.055 --> 12:07.560
You and your ambassadorks
are not my hostages.

12:07.643 --> 12:09.019
No, sir.

12:09.103 --> 12:12.231
You're my victims.

12:12.314 --> 12:17.945
Courtesy of our dear ex-pal,
Vandal Q. Savage.

12:18.028 --> 12:20.448
The Q stands for killjoy.

12:20.531 --> 12:23.117
You see, Lexie,
this is about respect.

12:23.200 --> 12:28.247
And who needs respect
more than a poor clown?

12:28.330 --> 12:31.041
A clown who's dedicated
his life

12:31.125 --> 12:36.213
to bringing a little sunshine
generating a few big,

12:36.297 --> 12:41.343
stinking grins onto the faces
of the masses.

12:41.427 --> 12:45.931
Until they choke
on those smiles and die!

12:46.015 --> 12:47.391

[exclaims in frustration]

12:52.271 --> 12:53.814
Well, horse puckies.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.192
Eh?

12:57.359 --> 12:59.820
The Bat's right behind me,
isn't he?

12:59.904 --> 13:01.739
I object!

13:01.822 --> 13:03.365
[Joker laughs]

13:03.449 --> 13:05.534
[crowd gasping and clamoring]

13:07.870 --> 13:09.955

You have to get her back.

She's like a sister to me.

13:28.807 --> 13:31.519
Mad as a hatter not to,
I hope.

13:31.602 --> 13:32.853
What was that?

13:32.937 --> 13:35.356
Nothing. Another hour
and it'll be dark.

13:35.439 --> 13:36.857
Then, we move.

13:36.941 --> 13:39.360
-Stay whelmed.
-[both] Whelmed?

13:50.704 --> 13:54.291
-Keep moving.
-No need. We're here.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.503
Not a Shadow in sight.
Couldn't be more inviting

13:57.586 --> 14:01.590
-if they hung
a free cookie sign.
-[both] We can't just walk in.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.134
It always comes down
to choosing the right door.

14:06.845 --> 14:11.100
[J'ann] You should stay here

[J'ann] You don't ever plan
to return here, do you?

14:25.656 --> 14:27.241
I'm not planning anything.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.173
[Cassandra] They're going
to see us coming.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.967
Not if we blind them.

[Oracle] Three, two, one and...

14:53.392 --> 14:54.810
-What?
-How?

14:54.893 --> 14:56.937
Please. You two aren't
the only ones with secrets.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.607
[Oracle]<i> It's done.</i>
<i>Main and backup generators</i>
<i>are down.</i>

14:59.690 --> 15:02.776
<i>They'll have</i>
<i>emergency power only.</i>
<i>No sensors, no alarms.</i>

15:02.860 --> 15:04.486
Come on, we're going in.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.246
[man groans]

15:50.366 --> 15:52.117
[man groans]

15:59.958 --> 16:02.419
I'd lay odds they're holding
Orphan in cellblock A.

16:02.503 --> 16:03.545
It's not much farther.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.673
Then this is as far as you go.

16:14.556 --> 16:15.933
Wait.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.893
I want to go with you.

16:17.976 --> 16:20.688
Learn about you
and your adopted world.

16:20.771 --> 16:24.108
Give us a chance
to become real sisters.

16:25.984 --> 16:28.487
You don't mind,
do you, Uncle J'onn?

16:28.570 --> 16:30.906
You are welcome
to join us, Em'ree.

16:30.989 --> 16:31.990
M'gann?

16:33.575 --> 16:34.743
[M'gann] If you want.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.169
Baby, all is ready.

16:52.302 --> 16:55.139
I fear we have lost them both,
my love.

17:00.477 --> 17:03.397
Tigress, I know
you don't believe me
but I'm sure she's a plant.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.940
We can't let her
go any farther.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.442
[gasps and strains]

17:06.525 --> 17:07.985
It's alright, Onyx.

17:08.068 --> 17:09.862
I've gone as far as I need to.

17:20.956 --> 17:22.249
A Glamour Charm.

17:22.332 --> 17:26.670
Be flattered, Tigress.
We had the idea from you.

17:26.754 --> 17:30.007
-[Onyx] What the hell?
-[grunts]

17:33.385 --> 17:34.511
Infiltrators.

17:34.595 --> 17:38.807
I'll be... Oh, thank God,
I found you.

17:41.435 --> 17:42.644
[Joker laughing]

17:44.646 --> 17:46.732
No! [screams]

17:58.452 --> 17:59.620
I've got you.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.706
I've got you.

18:11.924 --> 18:12.758
[Joker laughing]

18:20.516 --> 18:23.727
Nightwing to A33.
We need a medivac, stat!

18:23.811 --> 18:26.230
Hold on, please, hold on.

18:32.736 --> 18:35.531
I wasn't trying
to save Joker.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.866
I was trying to save you.

18:54.091 --> 18:56.218
It's okay.
I'm here to get you out.

18:56.301 --> 19:00.472
[Tigress]<i> And I suppose</i>
<i>that thing processes</i>
<i>the infiltrator's intel.</i>

19:01.682 --> 19:03.100
I'm on my way.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.394
<i>I'll be back, I promise.</i>

19:22.911 --> 19:24.788
I missed using that arm.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.088
Analyzing.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.425
Sonic pulse has successfully
disrupted all infiltrators.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.926
Data theft averted.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.553
Can I just say I told you so?

19:39.636 --> 19:42.556
Noted, though this doesn't mean
you're not a mole, too.

19:42.639 --> 19:43.891
[Onyx] Oh, come on.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.059
Hey, focus! Orphan's waiting.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.436
Which way to cell block A?

19:47.519 --> 19:49.688
You won't survive long enough
to find out.

19:49.771 --> 19:52.316
[Onyx] An empty threat.
It's two against one.

19:55.819 --> 19:57.863
Make that four against two.

20:00.198 --> 20:01.491
[coughing]

20:03.535 --> 20:04.703
Odds are evening.

20:05.704 --> 20:07.039
[coughing]

20:07.122 --> 20:08.540
[Oracle]<i> Follow the leader.</i>

20:08.624 --> 20:09.791
Cell block's this way.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.965
-I knew you'd come.
-Really? No doubts at all.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.258
None I'll admit to.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.469
Spoken like a true Crock,

20:20.552 --> 20:21.678
-of sh--
-We're here!

20:24.598 --> 20:26.350
[Oracle]<i> We need</i>
<i>to hurry this up.</i>

20:26.433 --> 20:28.060
Hang on, Orphan.
We'll get you out.

20:28.143 --> 20:29.436
[Black Spider]
Hold that thought.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.982
The boss may have other ideas.

20:35.901 --> 20:40.822
Just to surrender or die.

20:40.906 --> 20:44.868
[Tigress]<i> For each door</i>
<i>holds both results</i>

20:44.952 --> 20:47.454
<i>right up until the moment</i>
<i>it's opened.</i>

21:00.050 --> 21:03.428
<i>Her decision had been</i>
<i>indicated in an instant,</i>

21:03.512 --> 21:05.055
<i>but it had been made</i>

21:05.138 --> 21:08.266
<i>after days and nights</i>
<i>of anguished deliberation.</i>

21:08.350 --> 21:10.519
<i>She had known,</i>
<i>she would be asked.</i>

21:10.602 --> 21:12.562
<i>She had decided</i>
<i>what she would answer,</i>

21:12.646 --> 21:15.816
<i>and without</i>
<i>the slightest hesitation,</i>

21:15.899 --> 21:17.901
<i>she had moved her hand</i>
<i>to the right.</i>

21:18.986 --> 21:20.445
<i>The question of her decision</i>

21:20.529 --> 21:22.656
<i>is one not to be</i>
<i>lightly considered,</i>

21:22.739 --> 21:25.242
<i>and it is not for me</i>
<i>to presume to set myself up</i>

21:25.325 --> 21:28.370
<i>as the one person</i>
<i>able to answer it.</i>

21:28.453 --> 21:31.873
<i>And so I leave it</i>
<i>with all of you.</i>

21:31.957 --> 21:34.668
<i>Which came out</i>
<i>of the open door?</i>

21:34.751 --> 21:37.504
<i>The lady, or the tiger?</i>

21:39.381 --> 21:43.010
<i>Frank R. Stockton,</i>
The Lady, Or The Tiger?
