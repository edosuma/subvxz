 Mackenzie, I love you.

00:08.466 --> 00:11.261
I will marry you wherever
and whenever you want.

00:11.386 --> 00:14.139
 I now pronounce
you husband and wife.

00:17.308 --> 00:18.768
- Where are you off to?
- My place.

00:18.893 --> 00:20.478
 Yeah, he's got a really
cool record collection,

00:20.603 --> 00:22.480
so we're just going
to go study there.

00:22.605 --> 00:24.190
 I thought you and I were
going to do something later.

00:24.315 --> 00:25.650
My shift's almost over.

00:25.775 --> 00:28.653
 Yeah, well, we'll
just hang out after.

00:28.778 --> 00:30.238
 Yeah, OK, sure.

00:30.363 --> 00:36.036
 Hi, um, I'm Wyatt, and
I've never done this before,

00:36.161 --> 00:38.663
but this is for someone
special out there.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.415
(SINGING) I like you.

00:40.540 --> 00:44.919
I like you even
when I don't try to.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.588
Yes, I do.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.006
That's the truth.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.174

No!
IAN: OK.

01:20.372 --> 01:21.164
OK.

You want your game console?

No!

 Hi.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.674
 Hi, Mackenzie, hello.

01:30.799 --> 01:33.134
It's been forever.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.219
 I hope this isn't a bad time.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.720
 No, no, no.
It's fine.

01:35.845 --> 01:36.596
You remember Ian?

01:36.721 --> 01:37.597
 Hi.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.933
 And that's our son, Grayson.

01:40.058 --> 01:43.311
 Um, I just wanted to make sure
you had everything you need.

01:43.436 --> 01:44.771
 We do.

01:44.896 --> 01:47.732
I can't believe-- it
is so good to be back.

01:47.857 --> 01:49.818
I can't believe it's
been nine years since Ian

01:49.943 --> 01:51.653
and I walked down the
dock to get married.

01:51.778 --> 01:52.862
 I know.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.989
I'm so glad you decided
to vacation here.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.825
We're having a dinner
tonight at the house.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.160
I don't know if you
guys have plans or not,

01:59.285 --> 02:00.704
but we'd love to have you over.

02:00.829 --> 02:01.621
 Thank you.

02:01.746 --> 02:02.872
That's really nice.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.125
I think we're all a
little exhausted--

02:05.250 --> 02:06.835
- Yeah.
- Tonight.

02:06.960 --> 02:07.961
 Of course, that's fine.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.128
Maybe, maybe later in the week.

02:09.253 --> 02:10.755
 Absolutely.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.674
Yes, please, I cannot
wait to catch up with you,

02:12.799 --> 02:13.758
with all of you.

02:13.883 --> 02:15.135
 Yeah.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.678
 I should--

02:16.803 --> 02:18.138
 I just wanted to
make sure that you

02:18.263 --> 02:19.389
had everything you need.
- We do.

02:19.514 --> 02:20.557
- OK.
- Thank you, thank you.

02:20.682 --> 02:21.474
 OK.

 OK.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.481
 So this is an actual museum?

02:28.606 --> 02:32.819
 Yes, the Torrington
Gopher Hole Museum.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.487
 It's so weird.

02:34.612 --> 02:35.989
 Yeah, I don't get it.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.657
What's the point of
dressing up stuffed gophers

02:37.782 --> 02:39.576
and dropping them into
anthropomorphic settings?

02:39.701 --> 02:41.161
 The point is that
there is no point.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.120
Look, come on.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.663
OK, look at this.

02:43.788 --> 02:46.458
Gophers making a snowman,
gophers robbing a bank.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.834
You can't see this
anywhere else.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.085
We have to go sometime.

02:49.210 --> 02:49.961
 No, thanks.

 Dude.

02:51.379 --> 02:52.881
 Seeing it online
is enough for me.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.299
I've got to go.

02:54.424 --> 02:55.467

hang out with her.

How about you?

What are you doing tomorrow?

03:08.063 --> 03:09.147
 Nothing.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.316
Why?

03:11.441 --> 03:12.650
 You want to go on
a little road trip?

 Feel free to give
me a thank you call

All my love, Aunt Evelyn.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.624
 It is something.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.835
 It is something, all right.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.545
Yeah.

03:32.671 --> 03:36.132
She, she heard we officially
moved in together and wanted

03:36.257 --> 03:39.511
to get us something special.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.472
Apparently, this is painted
by Lisa's favorite artist.

03:42.597 --> 03:45.600
Now, I don't know too much
about this sort of thing,

03:45.725 --> 03:48.186
but I do know my
wife has good taste.

03:48.311 --> 03:51.398
So, well, if she
loves this artist,

03:51.523 --> 03:55.068
I should probably
hang it up somewhere.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.946
 Daddy, you have to
take me to dance class.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.406
 Yes, I know, sweetheart.

03:59.531 --> 04:00.615
I'm ready when you are.

04:00.740 --> 04:01.991
 But first you
have to do my hair.

04:02.117 --> 04:02.951
 OK, I'll be right there.

Can you?

04:16.380 --> 04:18.550
 Well, Daddy does it like this.

 Hey, can I go on a road
trip with Wyatt tomorrow?

04:20.760 --> 04:21.511
 What?

04:21.636 --> 04:22.679
 You're doing it all wrong.

04:22.804 --> 04:23.555
 Just hold still,
honey, please?

04:23.680 --> 04:24.431
 It's just to Torrington.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.057
It's not far.

04:26.182 --> 04:27.434
 Mommy does it way better.

04:27.559 --> 04:28.810
 I'm sure she does.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.603
Do I know Wyatt?

04:30.729 --> 04:33.398
 I'm not going to dance
class dressed like this.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.274
 Yes, you are, sweetheart.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.609

04:36.735 --> 04:38.278

Wow, I like your plane.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.718
It's a model of a
P-47 Thunderbolt.

It was the Allies best fighter
in a dogfight, even better

 Did your parents get you that?

05:10.810 --> 05:13.355
 It's armed with 850
caliber machine guns.

05:13.480 --> 05:18.610
It can carry 5 inch rockets or
a bomb load of 2,500 pounds.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.029
 Well, that's pretty cool.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.072
That's Chance.

 No, no, no.
Dangerous.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.393
That is dangerous.
- No.

No.
Come on.

Come on.
Sorry.

it would look better

somewhere less visible?

07:11.431 --> 07:13.058
 It hurts my eyeballs.

 All right, you two, that
painting happens to be painted

07:16.895 --> 07:19.773
by my wife's favorite artist,
not to mention the fact

07:19.898 --> 07:22.484
that it's a gift
from her, so we're

07:22.609 --> 07:23.485
all going to give it a chance.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.652
Is that clear?

07:27.280 --> 07:28.531
 Where's Katie?

07:28.656 --> 07:30.367
 She won't leave her room.

Apparently, all the girls made
fun of her hair at dance class.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.455
And, of course, it's
completely my fault.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.916
I'm basically just
ruining her life now.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.626
Oh, and she won't eat
dinner because she

07:39.751 --> 07:40.835
hates fried chicken.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.545
 That doesn't sound like Katie.

07:42.671 --> 07:45.173
 Yeah, well, her mom took her
out for some sushi in New York

07:45.298 --> 07:48.677
and now that's all
she wants to eat.

07:48.802 --> 07:52.180
 Did you get a chance to
think about that road trip?

07:52.305 --> 07:53.390
 Yes.

07:53.515 --> 07:54.933
Yes, I did, and,
yes, you can go,

07:55.058 --> 07:57.018
but I want to meet Wyatt first.

 What?

What's the problem?

08:01.773 --> 08:02.524
If you're too embarrassed
to introduce me to him,

08:02.649 --> 08:03.942
then you can't go, OK?

08:04.067 --> 08:05.527
It's not up for discussion.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.866
Wow.

08:11.991 --> 08:15.870
Jack, is that the spot for it?

08:15.995 --> 08:18.707
 That is also not
up for discussion.

believe how hard it is

Luckily, Casey had some in
her pantry so crisis averted.

08:28.258 --> 08:28.967
Can you take that, please?

08:29.092 --> 08:30.260
 Sure.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.178
 I have never even made
gluten free pancakes,

08:32.303 --> 08:35.306
but I'm thinking, I'm hoping,
that I found a good recipe,

08:35.432 --> 08:36.390
but who knows?

08:36.515 --> 08:38.018
It could all be a huge disaster.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.061
In that case, I will just
serve them with mimosas,

08:40.186 --> 08:41.395
because everything
tastes better when

08:41.520 --> 08:43.398

I'm Jen, Lou's new dude

already know you.

become pretty good friends.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.163
 Yes.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.789
How do you feel about this
whole road trip thing?

08:59.914 --> 09:01.041
I was thinking at first that,
you know, I wasn't sure,

09:01.166 --> 09:02.375
but they're both
really good kids,

09:02.500 --> 09:03.543
so I'm thinking it'll be OK.

09:03.668 --> 09:04.794
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- OK, great.

Later.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.307
 I don't like it here anymore.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.142
No, I don't want to
be with my daddy.

Why can't I come
with you to New York?

Love you, Mommy.

09:25.940 --> 09:26.775
Bye.

09:44.584 --> 09:45.418
 Hey.

09:45.543 --> 09:46.836
 Hi.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.421
 You're up early for
someone on vacation.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.964
 Well, it was a
beautiful morning,

09:50.090 --> 09:52.217
I thought I'd go for a stroll.

09:52.342 --> 09:53.093
Is this Lindy?

09:53.218 --> 09:54.052
 Yes, it is.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.095
 Wow, look at her.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.846
Isn't she a beauty?

09:56.971 --> 09:59.349
I remember when
Grayson was that small.

09:59.474 --> 10:01.726
Seems like just yesterday.

10:01.851 --> 10:05.730
They grow up really fast.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.399
Listen, I'm sorry
about yesterday.

10:07.524 --> 10:08.775
 Oh, that's OK.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.151
Traveling can be hard on kids.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.069
I get it.

10:11.194 --> 10:12.821
 Especially kids like Grayson.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.948
You know, routine is
very important to him.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.992
Any small change in
his daily schedule,

10:18.118 --> 10:19.619
and he really gets thrown off.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.163
 Kids like Grayson,
what do you mean?

10:24.874 --> 10:27.877
Mack didn't tell you.

10:28.003 --> 10:29.379
Well, when Grayson
was three years old,

10:29.504 --> 10:33.299
he was diagnosed with
autism spectrum disorder.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.969
You know, we knew something was
going on with him before that,

10:36.094 --> 10:39.639
but it was just good
to have a name for it.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.016
 I'm sorry, Ian.

10:41.141 --> 10:41.850
 No, it's OK.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.518
It's OK.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.187
I don't want to make it sound
like it's worse than it is.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.523
When he was diagnosed,
we didn't even

10:48.648 --> 10:50.233
know if he was ever
going to be able to speak

10:50.358 --> 10:54.654
or be potty trained, and
he's learned to do both.

10:54.779 --> 10:58.241
And he's really very smart,
especially when it comes

10:58.366 --> 11:03.830
to airplanes, but
he has a hard time

11:03.955 --> 11:06.708
connecting with other people.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.001
And we've been
working on that a lot

11:08.126 --> 11:09.336
with his doctors
and his therapist,

11:09.461 --> 11:12.005
but it's really hard.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.257
 If there's anything
I can do, let me know.

11:14.382 --> 11:18.762
 Actually there is
something you can do.

11:18.887 --> 11:22.140
I'd like to ask you
a really big favor.

11:22.265 --> 11:23.016
 Who's that?

11:23.141 --> 11:26.061
 Don't know.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.063
Hey, I'm Katie.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.356
This is Brick.

 Do you want to throw
rocks in the pond with us?

11:34.527 --> 11:37.906
[AIRPLANE SOUNDS PLAYING IN

11:39.657 --> 11:41.076
 Come on, let's go.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.872
 What are you going
to say to Wyatt?

11:45.997 --> 11:47.374
 I don't know.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.125
I thought I'd just invite
him in for a cup of tea

11:49.250 --> 11:51.419
and show him some
old family albums.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.921
 Dad.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.256
 It's OK if I friend
him on Facebook, right?

11:55.382 --> 11:56.591
Is that cool?

11:56.716 --> 11:57.884
Calm down.

11:58.009 --> 11:59.552
I just want to meet
him, that's all.

11:59.678 --> 12:01.513
I didn't know Adam was coming.

12:01.638 --> 12:09.688
 Neither did I. Hey.

12:09.813 --> 12:11.356
 Hey.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.565
 Adam, how are you?

12:12.691 --> 12:13.775
 Good.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.740
 Here you go.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.075
- You must be Wyatt?
- Yes.

12:22.200 --> 12:22.909
Hi.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.536
 I'm Georgie's dad.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.579
 Hi, nice to meet you.

12:26.705 --> 12:29.708
That's a good solid grip
you got there, Mr. Morris.

12:29.833 --> 12:30.709
 Uh-huh.

12:30.834 --> 12:31.876
 Hm-hmm.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.463
- Have her home by 10:00, OK?
- OK.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.381
Yeah.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.049
10:00, OK.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.635
Before 10:00, like
way before, so.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.803
 Sounds good.

12:41.928 --> 12:42.929
- Hours before.
- All right.

12:43.054 --> 12:43.972
 OK.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.186
- She is a beaut.
- Yeah.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.104
 Bye, Dad.

12:51.229 --> 12:52.063
 All right.

12:52.188 --> 12:52.772
Have fun.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.025
 Thank you so much.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.067
 Nice to meet you.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.944
 You too.

12:58.069 --> 12:59.487
 I thought you weren't
interested in the gopher

12:59.612 --> 13:01.197
museum?

13:01.322 --> 13:03.533
 I'm not, but Wyatt showed
up at my house this morning

13:03.658 --> 13:05.285
and wouldn't leave
until I got in the car.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.078
 Yeah, I'm doing you a favor.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.372
This is probably going to be
the best day of your life.

13:09.497 --> 13:10.623
 Doubtful.

13:10.749 --> 13:13.335
 You do the thing
I told you to?

13:13.460 --> 13:14.336
 Oh, yeah.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.920
Yeah.

13:16.046 --> 13:18.631
As instructed, I compiled
a playlist of songs

13:18.757 --> 13:19.966
suitable to a road trip.

13:20.091 --> 13:22.260
I considered our
various tastes in music,

13:22.385 --> 13:26.097
but also focused on themes
of summer and youth.

13:26.222 --> 13:26.890
 OK, good.

13:27.015 --> 13:29.517
You want to play it?

13:29.642 --> 13:30.852
 Yeah.

13:30.977 --> 13:36.024
[music playing]

13:46.576 --> 13:48.536
 She is beautiful.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.454
Can I hold her?

13:49.579 --> 13:51.539
 Yeah, of course.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.333
 1, 2, 3.

13:53.458 --> 13:54.584
Oh.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.294
 I had a nice chat
with Ian this morning.

13:56.419 --> 13:57.504
 Hm?

13:57.629 --> 13:59.839
 He mentioned riding
lessons for Grayson.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.549
 Of course, he did.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.385
 He said you might not
be in favor of them,

14:03.510 --> 14:06.971
but was hoping that maybe
I could change your mind.

14:07.097 --> 14:09.516
 Yeah, I don't agree
with Ian's opinion

14:09.641 --> 14:11.267
that horses are going
to magically solve

14:11.393 --> 14:13.311
all of our son's problems.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.605
 No, I don't think they're
going to magically fix them

14:15.730 --> 14:19.067
either, but I've seen kids
with special needs benefit

14:19.192 --> 14:20.527
from connecting
with horses in ways

14:20.652 --> 14:22.278
that are hard to understand.

14:22.404 --> 14:25.865
And sometimes, that leads
to connecting with people.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.410
At the very least,
Grayson might have fun.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.121
 I would do anything
to help my son,

14:31.246 --> 14:33.998
as long as it doesn't
jeopardize his safety.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.334
If he has a temper
tantrum on that horse,

14:36.459 --> 14:38.336
he could get seriously hurt.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.380
I'm sorry, the answer is no.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.674
 I understand.

14:42.799 --> 14:43.758
How about you?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.343
 What about me?

14:45.468 --> 14:48.096
 Well, when's the last
time you were on a horse?

14:48.221 --> 14:49.014
 Yeah.

14:49.139 --> 14:53.226
I mean, it's been not for--

14:53.351 --> 14:56.730
since at least before Grayson.

14:56.855 --> 14:58.898
 I think it's high time
you were to get back on,

14:59.024 --> 15:00.525
and I'm not taking
no for an answer.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.788
 Hey, have you seen Katie?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.457
 Yeah, she's at
the barn with Brick.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.958
They asked if they could
ride their horses over

15:17.083 --> 15:18.376
to the dude ranch to see Mitch.

15:18.501 --> 15:19.169
I said yes.

15:19.294 --> 15:20.170
I hope that's OK?

15:20.295 --> 15:21.212
 Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

15:21.338 --> 15:22.464
She rides up there all the time.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.257
 She left her
sushi on the table,

15:24.382 --> 15:25.425
so I just threw
it in the fridge.

15:25.550 --> 15:27.635
 Oh.

15:27.761 --> 15:28.595
Yeah.

15:31.890 --> 15:32.724
Oh, no, no.

15:32.849 --> 15:33.808
It didn't go bad, did it?

15:33.933 --> 15:34.893
 No, no.

15:35.018 --> 15:37.437
It's just she won't eat it.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.397
Her mom introduced her to sushi
when they were in New York

15:39.522 --> 15:40.774
together.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.400
She said she loved it,
but she refuses to eat it,

15:42.525 --> 15:44.319
so apparently, I
got the wrong kind.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.322
 Yes, kids and food,
the eternal struggle.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.740
 Right.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.950
I don't know it's so much
the food as it is she

15:51.076 --> 15:53.745
just misses her mom, you know?

15:53.870 --> 15:56.498
 Yeah, I get that.

15:56.623 --> 16:01.086
My husband used to make
BLTs every Saturday.

16:01.211 --> 16:04.506
Wyatt and Brick just loved them.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.633
When Curtis got too
sick to get out of bed,

16:06.758 --> 16:09.886
I was determined to
continue that tradition,

16:10.011 --> 16:16.059
but it just wasn't really
the same without him.

16:16.184 --> 16:21.356
Anyways, so I made
a new tradition.

16:21.481 --> 16:25.402
Every Sunday, we make
blueberry pancakes together,

16:25.527 --> 16:29.030
and that's not to replace what
he had with the boys, you know.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.865
It's their dad.

16:30.990 --> 16:35.870
He's irreplaceable, but now my
boys love blueberry pancakes

16:35.995 --> 16:38.957
and that's a win, a small win.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.835
You're going to eventually
have a win with Katie, too.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.170
You'll see.

16:44.295 --> 16:45.547
 Well, that would be great.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.215
 Just not with sushi.

16:52.262 --> 16:53.471
 There's a tree down.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.647
 Come on, let's see if we
can move it out of the way.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.190
 Let's just go around it.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.655
 Come on.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.574
 Whoa.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.035
Whoa.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.996
 Brick!

17:18.121 --> 17:19.998
Brick?

17:20.123 --> 17:21.249
 Whoa, stop.

17:28.173 --> 17:31.801
 Elise, I didn't
hear you come in.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.261
How was your trip?
- Good.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.095
Good.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.264
So that's new.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.100
 Oh, you noticed?

17:39.225 --> 17:43.563
That, that is a gift
from your Aunt Evelyn.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.106
 Oh?

17:45.231 --> 17:48.735
 She mentioned that you were
a big fan of this artist,

17:48.860 --> 17:51.905
so I figured I'd go
ahead and put it up.

17:52.030 --> 17:55.116
Now the place has a little
bit of your personality

17:55.241 --> 17:57.077
instead of just mine.

17:57.202 --> 17:58.203
 I see.

17:58.328 --> 17:59.871
Well, I don't know what to say.

17:59.996 --> 18:04.250
That's just too much.

18:04.376 --> 18:05.960
That's very generous of her.

18:06.086 --> 18:09.255
 Yeah, it certainly is.

18:09.381 --> 18:12.425
So, let's get you unpacked.

18:12.550 --> 18:13.927
I want to hear all
about your trip.

18:14.052 --> 18:14.803
 Thank you.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.059
 Plastic bottle?

18:21.184 --> 18:22.268
Good Lord.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.313
 Katie?

18:31.695 --> 18:32.570
Katie?

18:38.952 --> 18:39.828
There you are.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.498
Whoa.

18:46.751 --> 18:47.585
Come on.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.172
Katie?

19:03.810 --> 19:04.686
 Brick?

19:04.811 --> 19:06.271
Where are you, Brick?

19:19.451 --> 19:21.536
[upbeat music playing]

19:43.308 --> 19:45.310
 You've been pretty
quiet since we left.

19:45.435 --> 19:46.519
Is everything OK?

19:46.644 --> 19:47.979
 Yeah, it's just--
it's a little

19:48.104 --> 19:49.731
hard to hear in the back.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.441
 Oh, well, you should sit up
here for the rest of the trip.

19:51.566 --> 19:53.568
You can take over
Adam's DJing duties.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.404
Just take it easy on the
death metal though, OK?

19:56.529 --> 19:59.866
Because I know how
much you like it.

19:59.991 --> 20:00.867
Yo, Georgie called shotgun.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.243
 No.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.578
It's OK, Adam, you
sit in the front.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.179
 I understand that, but
what about my influence?

20:21.304 --> 20:23.348
So why do you think I don't
know what's best for my son?

20:23.473 --> 20:24.641
 I didn't say that.

20:24.766 --> 20:25.850
 OK, then why are
you so against it?

20:25.975 --> 20:27.352
 Because I know
Grayson, because I

20:27.477 --> 20:29.104
know that he's not ready.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.438
 You're the one
who's not ready.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.314
 What?

20:31.439 --> 20:34.401
I'm not-- this isn't it--

20:34.526 --> 20:35.443
Wow.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.452
 Hey.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.704
 Which one's my horse?

20:45.829 --> 20:48.081
 This guy right here, Chance.

20:48.206 --> 20:50.959
He was abandoned at a
clinic I taught last year.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.794
Oh, poor guy.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.129
 Yeah.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.755
He was a little
messed up back then,

20:55.880 --> 20:57.966
but now he's the most gentle
horse on our whole property.

20:58.091 --> 20:58.800
 Yeah?

20:58.925 --> 20:59.968
 Yeah.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.886
 Go easy on me, Chance.

21:02.012 --> 21:03.221
It's been a while.

21:03.346 --> 21:06.057
 OK, do you need a hand?

21:06.182 --> 21:07.017
You ready?

21:07.142 --> 21:08.435
Oh, you are.

21:27.704 --> 21:29.414
 Closed?

21:29.539 --> 21:30.957
 OK, it's no big deal.

21:31.082 --> 21:32.792
We'll just find a window
or a door that's unlocked.

21:40.258 --> 21:41.134
 We're not breaking in.

21:41.259 --> 21:42.344
Have you lost your mind?

21:42.469 --> 21:43.428
 Yeah, that does
seem a bit extreme.

21:43.553 --> 21:44.846
I have a better idea.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.389
 It's not like we're
going to steal anything.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.266
We'll just let ourselves in,
take a couple of pictures

21:48.391 --> 21:49.809
or whatever, and then dip.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.686
 How about we not do any
of those things and go home?

21:51.811 --> 21:52.896
 I have an idea.

21:53.021 --> 21:54.439
 We didn't come all
this way to not see

21:54.564 --> 21:56.483
hilarious gopher dioramas, OK?

21:56.608 --> 21:58.860
So I don't know about
you, but I'm going in.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.320
 I hope you like jail.

22:00.445 --> 22:01.196
 Nobody's going to jail.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.113
Stop being so dramatic.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.114
 OK, wait.

22:03.239 --> 22:04.449
Give me the keys.

22:04.574 --> 22:05.700
I need to get my
bag out of the car.

22:05.825 --> 22:06.910
Thank you.

22:07.035 --> 22:08.370
 I knew I should
have stayed home.

22:10.997 --> 22:13.041
 This no risk policy
of yours is a one-way

22:13.166 --> 22:14.626
ticket to Snoozeville.

22:14.751 --> 22:15.960
 I'd rather live in
Snoozeville than get stabbed

22:16.086 --> 22:17.128
with a toothbrush in jail.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.046
 That's stupid.

22:24.386 --> 22:25.387
Where is she going?

22:36.022 --> 22:36.898
 Brick?

22:51.162 --> 22:52.414
 The kids back yet?

22:52.539 --> 22:54.332
 Horses are still gone.

22:54.457 --> 22:55.542
Something wrong?

22:55.667 --> 22:56.876
 No.

22:57.002 --> 22:58.753
No, I just-- they're
up at the dude ranch.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.630
I thought they might
be back by now.

23:00.755 --> 23:02.382
 Probably hanging
out with Mitch.

23:02.507 --> 23:04.175
 Yeah.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.302
I'm going to head up there,
I think, just check on them.

23:06.428 --> 23:08.054
Make sure they're not
overstaying their welcome.

23:12.767 --> 23:13.768
 Remember when you
said this is going

23:13.893 --> 23:15.937
to be the best day of my life?

23:16.062 --> 23:17.772
You were wrong.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.482
 Why isn't she answering?

23:19.607 --> 23:21.443
 She's probably halfway
back to Hudson by now.

23:24.070 --> 23:28.241
 Hey, are you boys in
need of some assistance?

23:28.366 --> 23:29.576
 OK, we get it.

23:29.701 --> 23:31.327
We were being jerks.

23:31.453 --> 23:33.204
 Speak for yourself.

23:33.329 --> 23:34.247
 Fine.

23:34.372 --> 23:36.249
I was being a jerk.

23:36.374 --> 23:37.417
 Can we go home now, please?

23:37.542 --> 23:39.252
 Get in.

23:39.377 --> 23:40.420
 OK.

23:43.006 --> 23:46.301
 While you two were wandering
around like lost puppies,

23:46.426 --> 23:47.969
I went to the diner
up the street.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.847
 Did you bring any leftovers
because I'm starving.

23:50.972 --> 23:53.475
 No, I didn't go
there for food.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.851
If you had listened
earlier, I would

23:54.976 --> 23:56.936
have explained everything.

23:57.062 --> 23:58.646
I work in a diner
in a small town.

23:58.772 --> 24:00.273
Everyone knows everyone.

24:00.398 --> 24:02.025
It's no different here.

24:02.150 --> 24:04.903
I asked the waitress if she knew
how we could get into a museum

24:05.028 --> 24:07.447
and it turns out her husband
is the maintenance guy,

24:07.572 --> 24:09.240
so he's coming to let us in.

24:09.366 --> 24:10.784
 Are you serious?

24:10.909 --> 24:13.328
 Does this mean
we're not going home?

24:13.453 --> 24:16.539
 Georgie, this road trip
was in a cardiac arrest.

24:16.664 --> 24:18.833
You just brought
it back to life.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.126
You're amazing, you know that?

24:26.466 --> 24:32.472
[music playing]

25:21.604 --> 25:22.689
 Wyatt!

25:27.110 --> 25:27.902
 OK.

25:35.869 --> 25:36.995
 Wow.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.747
That's a real conversation
piece, isn't it?

25:38.872 --> 25:41.082
 Yes, it certainly is.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.293
 There used to be this
elephant at the Calgary Zoo

25:43.418 --> 25:45.754
who painted with her trunk and
that kind of reminds me of it,

25:45.879 --> 25:47.297
only she was much more talented.

25:47.422 --> 25:48.548
 Thank you.

25:48.673 --> 25:50.091
 Hey, Elise, how's Lindy doing?

25:50.216 --> 25:51.051
 She's great.

25:51.176 --> 25:51.926
Fast asleep.

25:52.052 --> 25:53.470
 That's good.

25:53.595 --> 25:56.848
 Hey, so there's no sign of
the kids at the dude ranch

25:56.973 --> 25:58.892
and Mitch is not in his trailer.

25:59.017 --> 26:00.143
 Well, that's strange.

26:00.268 --> 26:01.353
I mean, they left
over an hour ago.

26:01.478 --> 26:02.437
 I'll give Mitch a call.

26:02.562 --> 26:03.605
 Thanks.

26:06.191 --> 26:10.195
 Yeah, Mitch, are those
kids still over there?

26:10.320 --> 26:12.030
Well, where are you?

26:12.155 --> 26:14.115
Oh, I see.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.450
Oh, no, no, no.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.035
It's no problem.

26:17.160 --> 26:18.745
All right.

26:18.870 --> 26:21.164
Well, he's been in
Calgary all day.

26:21.289 --> 26:24.084
 Why wouldn't they have
come home if he wasn't there?

26:24.209 --> 26:25.794
 Oh, I'm sure they're
just out having fun.

26:25.919 --> 26:26.961
 Yeah.
Yeah.

26:27.087 --> 26:28.505
Probably.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.256
Is it OK if I saddle up a horse
and go take a look though,

26:30.382 --> 26:31.800
just to be safe?
- I'll come with you.

26:31.925 --> 26:32.967
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:37.972 --> 26:39.808
 I got to say this is
the most relaxed I've

26:39.933 --> 26:43.269
been in I don't know how long.

26:43.395 --> 26:45.772
You were right, Chance
is a great horse.

26:45.897 --> 26:48.149
 He would be
perfect for Grayson,

26:48.274 --> 26:50.527
if you decided to go forward
with the riding lessons.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.445
 Is that why you tried to
convince me to come for a ride?

26:52.570 --> 26:55.573
You thought if I got to
know Chance I'd be more--

26:55.699 --> 26:58.118
 Just part of the reason.

26:58.243 --> 27:00.370
 I don't know what Ian
told you about Grayson,

27:00.495 --> 27:03.289
but he's a good boy.

27:03.415 --> 27:04.958
All of his therapists
and doctors

27:05.083 --> 27:06.793
say he's doing really well.

27:06.918 --> 27:09.045
 And how about you?

27:09.170 --> 27:10.046
 Me?

27:10.171 --> 27:12.716
I'm fine.

27:12.841 --> 27:15.093
 I heard you Ian arguing.

27:15.218 --> 27:16.594
I know it's none of my business.

27:16.720 --> 27:17.512
I'm sorry, I shouldn't--

27:17.637 --> 27:20.974
 No, no, it's OK.

27:21.099 --> 27:25.061
Since Grayson was
born, all of our energy

27:25.186 --> 27:29.399
goes into making sure he
has everything he needs.

27:29.524 --> 27:32.485
It's not a once a day thing.

27:32.610 --> 27:33.695
It's every day.
It's every minute.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.321
It's every hour.

27:35.447 --> 27:40.035
And it doesn't leave a lot
of time for a marriage.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.120
 Yeah.

27:42.245 --> 27:44.164
 Amy?

27:44.289 --> 27:44.998
 Hey, Brick.

27:45.123 --> 27:46.124
What are you doing out here?

27:46.249 --> 27:47.125
Is everything OK?

27:47.250 --> 27:48.043
 I lost Katie.

28:02.474 --> 28:04.851
 What happened to Brick?

28:04.976 --> 28:05.894
 He's with Mackenzie.

28:06.019 --> 28:06.936
They're headed back to the barn.

28:07.062 --> 28:08.271
 Any sign of Katie?

28:08.396 --> 28:09.689
 No.

28:09.814 --> 28:11.107
Brick said this is
where he last saw her.

28:11.232 --> 28:13.568
This is where the
horse was spooked.

28:13.693 --> 28:15.987
 That's Katie's helmet.

28:16.112 --> 28:17.072
 We better split up.

28:17.197 --> 28:18.073
 Yeah.

28:20.617 --> 28:22.535
Katie?

28:22.660 --> 28:23.828
 You head over that way.

28:30.835 --> 28:31.920
 I'll be right back.

28:45.850 --> 28:48.937
 I hate to be obvious,
but you like her.

28:49.062 --> 28:50.563
 What?

28:50.689 --> 28:52.148
 I know the idea of liking
someone is pretty subjective,

28:52.273 --> 28:53.900
but you're demonstrating
all the typical signs.

28:54.025 --> 28:56.111
 Dude, we're not having
this conversation.

28:56.236 --> 28:57.112
 Why?

28:57.237 --> 28:59.197
Because I used to date Georgie?

28:59.322 --> 29:00.699
 Yeah.

29:00.824 --> 29:02.325
 We live in a small town.

29:02.450 --> 29:04.619
I've done the math, the chances
that we'll end up dating

29:04.744 --> 29:06.162
the same girls or one in five.

29:06.287 --> 29:07.747
Now that doesn't
sound like much,

29:07.872 --> 29:12.085
but statistically, it's
actually quite significant.

29:12.210 --> 29:13.044
 OK.

29:13.169 --> 29:14.921
So why are you telling me this?

29:15.046 --> 29:16.965
 Because if you don't get out
of the car and talk to her,

29:17.090 --> 29:18.299
then you are dumber
than you look.

29:32.439 --> 29:34.607
 Georgie, hey.

29:34.733 --> 29:39.154
I just wanted to say that
I'm having a great time.

29:39.279 --> 29:41.614
 Me, too.

29:41.740 --> 29:47.579
I mean, although this isn't
exactly what I had in mind.

29:47.704 --> 29:49.330
 What do you mean?

29:49.456 --> 29:52.042
 Well, I just thought it
was going to be you and me,

29:52.167 --> 29:54.127
but clearly that's not
what you're thinking.

29:54.252 --> 29:55.420
 No.

29:55.545 --> 29:58.673
No, that's, that's exactly
what I had in mind.

29:58.798 --> 30:02.344
 Then why did you invite Adam?

30:02.469 --> 30:03.928
 I don't know.

30:04.054 --> 30:05.597
I panicked.

30:05.722 --> 30:06.848
I didn't want you to feel
like there was any pressure

30:06.973 --> 30:08.099
on this to be like a date.

30:10.977 --> 30:13.480
 So did you want
it to be a date or--

30:13.605 --> 30:14.606
[cellphone ringing]

30:14.731 --> 30:16.566
 Sorry.

30:16.691 --> 30:19.110
It's my mom.

30:19.235 --> 30:20.028
Hey.

30:22.781 --> 30:27.660
I don't know, like an
hour away, I think.

30:27.786 --> 30:28.870
What?

30:31.456 --> 30:32.499
OK.

30:32.624 --> 30:34.292
Yeah, OK, I'll tell her.

30:34.417 --> 30:35.210
OK, bye.

30:37.837 --> 30:38.838
 What's wrong?

30:38.963 --> 30:39.964
 We have to go home.

31:20.380 --> 31:21.256
 Katie?

31:32.392 --> 31:33.768
Katie?

31:33.893 --> 31:34.936
 Katie!

31:37.981 --> 31:39.024
Katie!

31:50.410 --> 31:52.454
I hate the thought of
Katie being out here alone.

31:55.540 --> 31:56.249
 Hey.

31:56.374 --> 31:57.542
 Hey, I'm here to help.

32:11.639 --> 32:13.058
 Hey, Grayson, hang out
here for a second, OK?

32:13.183 --> 32:15.435
I'll be right back.

32:15.560 --> 32:16.478
I love you.

32:36.915 --> 32:39.626
 Any word about Katie?

32:39.751 --> 32:41.628
 No.

32:41.753 --> 32:42.671
Amy said she'd call.

32:50.887 --> 32:55.141
It's funny to think we got
married standing right here.

32:55.266 --> 32:57.143
 Yeah, I was just
thinking the same thing.

33:00.605 --> 33:03.358
 You know, I'll never
forget how you dressed up

33:03.483 --> 33:06.695
in that armor and you
rode up to the house

33:06.820 --> 33:08.196
to sweep me off my feet.

33:11.116 --> 33:12.367
 It's like
different people were

33:12.492 --> 33:13.535
living their lives back then.

33:17.497 --> 33:20.875
Those people have disappeared.

33:21.001 --> 33:24.087
They'd been replaced
by tired, worn

33:24.212 --> 33:26.423
out parents running from
one doctor's appointment

33:26.548 --> 33:27.382
to the next.

33:32.721 --> 33:39.894
 Maybe while we're here,
we could try to remember

33:40.020 --> 33:43.356
who those people are.

33:43.481 --> 33:45.233
That we're a couple
who love each other.

33:52.615 --> 33:53.408
I love you.

33:56.119 --> 33:57.203
 I love you, too.

34:01.291 --> 34:02.334
 Where's Grayson?

34:08.465 --> 34:09.007
Grayson?

34:09.132 --> 34:10.257
 Grayson?

34:17.556 --> 34:18.641
[gasp]

34:18.766 --> 34:20.601
 Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

34:20.726 --> 34:21.603
It's OK.

34:40.955 --> 34:42.373
 Good boy, Chance.

34:42.498 --> 34:43.625
You're such a good boy.

35:06.773 --> 35:07.649
 Katie?

35:11.528 --> 35:12.737
 Daddy?

35:12.862 --> 35:13.988
 Hey.

35:14.114 --> 35:15.490
 Daddy.

35:15.615 --> 35:16.908
Daddy.

35:17.033 --> 35:18.493
 Oh my God.

35:30.255 --> 35:34.551
 OK, Grayson, you
ready to get on?

35:34.676 --> 35:37.512
 You want to get
on the horse, Bud?

35:37.637 --> 35:38.680
Come here.

35:38.805 --> 35:39.973
Ready?

35:40.098 --> 35:40.932
 No!
No!

35:41.057 --> 35:41.808
No!

35:41.933 --> 35:42.809
 OK.

35:42.934 --> 35:43.768
 Come here.

35:45.937 --> 35:48.106
Look at me.

35:48.231 --> 35:49.941
You know when you're
up in an airplane,

35:50.066 --> 35:53.319
way up above everything and
you feel calm and happy?

35:53.445 --> 35:56.072
That's what it feels
like to be on a horse.

35:56.197 --> 35:58.825
It feels like you're flying.

35:58.950 --> 36:03.538
Do you want to give
it a try, yes or no?

36:03.663 --> 36:05.081
 Yes.

36:05.206 --> 36:06.291
 OK.

36:10.545 --> 36:11.171
 OK.

36:11.296 --> 36:13.631
Ready, Bud?

36:13.757 --> 36:14.549
Here we go.

36:18.094 --> 36:19.220
That's it.

36:25.018 --> 36:26.603
OK, what now?

36:26.728 --> 36:28.855
 I want you two to go
on either side of him,

36:28.980 --> 36:30.398
just support him as we walk.

36:33.818 --> 36:34.903
You ready, Grayson?

36:35.028 --> 36:36.404
We're just going to
take this nice and slow.

36:51.002 --> 36:52.420
 There.

36:52.545 --> 36:55.590
Do you want to keep going?

36:55.715 --> 36:56.591
 Yes.

37:12.023 --> 37:12.941
 OK.

37:18.571 --> 37:22.450
That thing is coming
down right now.

37:22.575 --> 37:24.119
 What?

37:24.244 --> 37:28.581
 It doesn't go with anything
in here, and I cannot stand it.

37:28.707 --> 37:32.252
 But your aunt said that
was your favorite artist.

37:32.377 --> 37:33.670
 I don't care what she said.

37:33.795 --> 37:38.258
She is wrong and
clearly confused.

37:38.383 --> 37:42.387
 Then why didn't
you say anything?

37:44.889 --> 37:46.975
 Because I can tell how
much you're trying to make

37:47.100 --> 37:49.019
me feel at home here.

37:49.144 --> 37:51.896
 Well, it's your home
as much as it is mine.

37:52.022 --> 37:54.899
 Yeah, I know, and I don't
need a painting to prove it,

37:55.025 --> 37:58.820
and certainly not one
covered in garbage.

37:58.945 --> 38:02.449
 Well, you know, I'd rather
look at bacon grease splattered

38:02.574 --> 38:04.242
on the back of a stove.

38:04.367 --> 38:05.994
 You and me both.

38:06.119 --> 38:07.245
All right, you know what?

38:07.370 --> 38:08.913
Why don't we go into
town to a gallery

38:09.039 --> 38:11.583
and the two of us will pick
out something that we love.

38:11.708 --> 38:14.002
 I would like that
very much, and we'll

38:14.127 --> 38:17.088
take that to the thrift
store on the way by.

38:17.213 --> 38:17.964
 No.

38:18.089 --> 38:19.299
No.

38:19.424 --> 38:20.175
This has to go
back into storage.

38:20.300 --> 38:21.760
 Why?

38:21.885 --> 38:24.512
 Because when Aunt Evelyn
comes back for a visit,

38:24.637 --> 38:27.640
it's going back on wall.

38:27.766 --> 38:28.683
 Oh.

38:33.063 --> 38:35.065
 Look who it is, Lindy.

38:35.190 --> 38:36.649
Hi, Daddy.

38:36.775 --> 38:38.693
 Hey, Lindy.

38:38.818 --> 38:39.986
Are you ready for
your first barbecue?

38:40.111 --> 38:41.154
 Oh, she is.

38:41.279 --> 38:42.864
She even got a nice new outfit.

38:42.989 --> 38:43.823
 Looking good, Lindy.

38:43.948 --> 38:46.076
Looking good.

38:46.201 --> 38:48.036
 Only one more sleep
till you're home.

38:48.161 --> 38:52.123
 Yeah, and it can't
come soon enough.

38:52.248 --> 38:53.124
I love you girls.

38:53.249 --> 38:54.834
 We love you, too.

38:54.959 --> 38:55.835
Bye.

38:55.960 --> 38:56.878
Bye, Daddy.

39:01.424 --> 39:02.467
Bye, Daddy.

39:09.349 --> 39:11.267
 Jack.

39:11.393 --> 39:14.187
 Well, look at you.

39:14.312 --> 39:16.773
Was it really nine
years ago that I

39:16.898 --> 39:19.067
walked you down the aisle?

39:19.192 --> 39:20.902
Or should I say pier?

39:21.027 --> 39:21.820
 Yeah.

39:21.945 --> 39:23.238
Yeah, it was.

39:23.363 --> 39:24.489
 A lot has changed since then.

39:24.614 --> 39:26.533
 Yeah, I guess so.

39:26.658 --> 39:28.284
 You just can't
let it be nine years

39:28.410 --> 39:29.327
before you come visit again.

39:29.452 --> 39:30.370
 OK.

39:30.495 --> 39:31.329
 We'll do our best.

39:31.454 --> 39:35.000
 Yeah, definitely.

39:35.125 --> 39:37.085
 Can I have another
hot dog, please?

39:40.046 --> 39:42.632
 Well, yes, you can, and
I'm very happy that you

39:42.757 --> 39:43.508
like hot dogs again.

39:43.633 --> 39:44.426
 Thank you, Daddy.

39:44.551 --> 39:46.094
 You're welcome, honey.

39:46.219 --> 39:47.012
You too, Buddy?

39:47.137 --> 39:49.180
 Thank you.

39:49.305 --> 39:51.808
 See, told you.

39:51.933 --> 39:54.894
That was a win, my friend.

39:55.020 --> 39:57.856
 So Jack tells me
that you and Wyatt

39:57.981 --> 39:59.566
went on a bit of a road trip.

39:59.691 --> 40:01.234
 Not just Wyatt, Adam came too.

40:01.359 --> 40:05.822
 Oh, yeah, but you and Wyatt
are hanging out a little bit

40:05.947 --> 40:07.198
together?

40:07.323 --> 40:08.575
 I guess.

40:08.700 --> 40:09.701
 You know he's down
at the barbecue?

40:09.826 --> 40:11.453
Don't you want to go say hi?

40:11.578 --> 40:13.788
 No, not really.

40:13.913 --> 40:17.459
 Did he do something
to upset you?

40:17.584 --> 40:19.419
 He's just so confusing.

40:19.544 --> 40:21.296
One minute he
dedicates a song to me,

40:21.421 --> 40:24.549
and the next he's
pretending I don't exist.

40:24.674 --> 40:27.093
 Sounds like he's
maybe scared of you.

40:27.218 --> 40:28.762
 What?

40:28.887 --> 40:29.929
 Well, you're an intelligent,
confident, young woman

40:30.055 --> 40:32.432
who knows what she
wants, and he's probably

40:32.557 --> 40:34.726
just trying to catch up to you.

40:34.851 --> 40:36.269
 Well, what do I do?

40:36.394 --> 40:39.272
 I would take these steaks
down to the dude ranch

40:39.397 --> 40:42.233
and just stop avoiding him.

40:42.359 --> 40:44.402
 Does this ever get any easier?

40:44.527 --> 40:45.987
 No, ma'am, it
certainly doesn't.

40:55.080 --> 40:55.997
 Hey.

40:56.122 --> 40:56.998
Sorry.

41:01.544 --> 41:03.672
 Georgie, are those the steaks?

41:11.137 --> 41:13.390
Let's see here.

41:13.515 --> 41:14.849
Looks pretty good.

41:17.977 --> 41:20.605

 GRAYSON'S HEAD]

41:20.730 --> 41:22.023
 Want to play tag?

41:22.148 --> 41:22.982
Tag, you're it.

41:35.870 --> 41:37.497
 They really do
change your lives.

41:37.622 --> 41:40.000
It's so incredible.

41:40.125 --> 41:41.042
 Ian?

41:41.167 --> 41:42.210
 Yeah.

41:42.335 --> 41:44.212
[kids laughing]

41:50.760 --> 41:51.803
 That's amazing.

41:56.307 --> 41:59.269
 Now don't you go thinking
this is because of the horse.

41:59.394 --> 42:00.687
 No.

42:00.812 --> 42:06.317
 This is years of
therapy and specialists.

42:06.443 --> 42:07.235
 Yeah, of course.

42:07.360 --> 42:08.236
 You can't get me.

42:14.451 --> 42:18.830
 It can't just be
coincidence though, can it?

42:18.955 --> 42:22.250
 Does it really matter?

42:22.375 --> 42:23.585
 Nope.

42:23.710 --> 42:28.256
[music playing]

42:44.064 --> 42:45.607
 I was wondering where
you disappeared to.

42:52.572 --> 42:56.785
So, Adam is a pretty cool guy.

43:00.038 --> 43:02.415
 You came here to tell me that?

43:02.540 --> 43:04.209
 No.

43:04.334 --> 43:05.126
No.

43:05.251 --> 43:08.588
Well, kind of.

43:08.713 --> 43:12.133
I came to tell you that I
think that Adam is a cool guy,

43:12.258 --> 43:15.303
but I wish I hadn't invited
him on the road trip with us.

43:15.428 --> 43:16.304
 Why?

43:19.974 --> 43:22.936
 Because there wasn't
a right time to do this.
