00:00.867 --> 00:02.869
[singing] MTV

00:02.969 --> 00:04.871
Previously on
"RuPaul's Drag Race"...

00:04.971 --> 00:06.906
We are throwing a ball.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.042
[cheering]

00:09.142 --> 00:10.810
Salina EsTittes.

00:10.910 --> 00:12.912
I'm in love with
your personality,

00:13.013 --> 00:15.215
but I also want to be
in love with your dress.

00:15.315 --> 00:16.483
Spice.

00:16.583 --> 00:18.651
The skirt is a piece
of fabric tied together.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.186
Sasha Colby.

00:20.286 --> 00:21.921
It looks like something that
would be from the Met Gala.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.356
Condragulations.

00:23.456 --> 00:24.624
You're the winner of
this week's challenge.

00:24.724 --> 00:25.992
Yay!

00:26.092 --> 00:29.329
Salina EsTittes,
shantay, you stay.

00:29.429 --> 00:30.330
Thank you.

00:30.430 --> 00:33.600
Spice, sashay away.

00:35.235 --> 00:40.206
[punchy music]

00:43.343 --> 00:44.744
Oh, oh.

00:44.844 --> 00:45.945
Oh, my God.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.048
Aw, my Baby.

00:48.148 --> 00:49.582
Spice is gone.

00:49.682 --> 00:51.785
I feel so sad that
it's her time to leave,

00:51.885 --> 00:53.653
but I'm not sad that
I'm still here, bitch.

00:53.753 --> 00:56.423
"It's been so easy and so fun."

00:56.523 --> 00:57.724
Yeah.

00:57.824 --> 00:59.392
"Thank you for
being my new sisters

00:59.492 --> 01:00.994
"when my real one left me.

01:01.094 --> 01:03.129
PS, where does
the dingaling go?"

01:03.229 --> 01:07.467
I'm looking at three canned
bits all mushed into one.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.936
Even knowing that I was
lip syncing against her

01:10.036 --> 01:11.271
had me so positive.

01:11.371 --> 01:12.605
Because she made it fun.

01:12.705 --> 01:14.207
No, 'cause I was gonna
send her home, bitch.

01:14.307 --> 01:16.342
[all cackling]

01:16.443 --> 01:18.144
Spice was like
a daughter to me.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.446
I'm definitely
going to miss her,

01:19.546 --> 01:21.781
but separating
personal from drag--

01:21.881 --> 01:23.716
it was definitely
her time to go.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.452
- Sasha.
- Hi.

01:25.552 --> 01:28.855
How does it feel to have
now won two challenges?

01:28.955 --> 01:30.890
Oh, it was so good.

01:30.990 --> 01:32.525
Tonight, Sasha, like,
you literally, like,

01:32.625 --> 01:33.960
peed on the stage.

01:34.060 --> 01:35.462
Like, you peed.

01:35.562 --> 01:36.830
Y'all should
soak some of that up

01:36.930 --> 01:38.198
so y'all can get a win, too.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.232
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:39.332 --> 01:40.333
Ooh, Girl.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.502
I already won three.

01:44.170 --> 01:45.271
Oh, wow.

01:45.371 --> 01:48.641
I feel like people
are forgetting

01:48.741 --> 01:52.045
how well I have been
doing in this competition.

01:52.145 --> 01:55.348
I'm the only person who
has won three challenges,

01:55.448 --> 01:56.883
two minis and a main.

01:56.983 --> 01:57.951
Loosey, how are you feeling?

01:58.051 --> 01:58.952
Lucille.

01:59.052 --> 02:01.421
Still feeling good, honestly.

02:03.656 --> 02:05.992
[all cackling]

02:06.092 --> 02:08.461
Mistress laughs every
time I open my mouth.

02:08.561 --> 02:09.762
I thought it was
funny that you said,

02:09.863 --> 02:11.431
I'm still feeling really
good, when the last time

02:11.531 --> 02:13.800
we were here, you said,
I'm fucking pissed.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.369
I'm feeling good because

02:16.469 --> 02:18.671
even though they didn't
like my second look,

02:18.771 --> 02:20.373
they really loved
my first and third look.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.209
And I agree with them with the
critiques on the second look.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.145
[laughs] Sometimes
I can't help

02:25.245 --> 02:28.214
but laugh at Loosey because
I know she's being fake.

02:29.582 --> 02:30.917
What are you laughing about?

02:31.017 --> 02:32.519
She laughs at every single--

02:32.619 --> 02:33.786
This is not congenial.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.322
[squealing laughter]

02:36.422 --> 02:38.424
Loosey is much more competitive

02:38.525 --> 02:39.926
than she alludes to.

02:40.026 --> 02:41.461
Loosey, I'm just
so happy for you

02:41.561 --> 02:42.962
'cause I feel like
you're finally

02:43.062 --> 02:44.898
entering your bitch era.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.801
Mistress is projecting
onto me because,

02:48.902 --> 02:53.406
mama, if anyone is a bitch,
Mistress is the bitch.

02:54.874 --> 02:56.075
- Mosh.
- Yes?

02:56.176 --> 02:57.810
How are you feeling?

02:57.911 --> 03:00.446
Honestly, I thought I
was going to be in the top.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.916
I thought I was
a contender to win.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.984
I don't understand
why everyone else

03:05.084 --> 03:07.187
is allowed to be
upset at their placement,

03:07.287 --> 03:10.190
and I'm getting
really fed up with it.

03:10.290 --> 03:13.193
I mean, I really--

03:13.293 --> 03:15.628
I think I executed
what they ask me to do.

03:15.728 --> 03:17.530
Are you gonna attack her?
[laughs]

03:17.630 --> 03:19.098
Sorry, there's some
drama going on over there.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.567
Oh, I'm sorry.
Loosey was trying to see

03:20.667 --> 03:22.001
if I was going to attack you

03:22.101 --> 03:23.369
because there goes Loosey
being a bitch again.

03:23.469 --> 03:24.571
No, stop.

03:24.671 --> 03:26.172
[laughter]

03:26.272 --> 03:28.841
I have won some of the most
iconic challenges

03:28.942 --> 03:30.543
in "Drag Race" herstory,

03:30.643 --> 03:34.480
so I think I have earned
a certain level of respect,

03:34.581 --> 03:36.249
and I'm not being shown that.

03:36.349 --> 03:37.951
I know I stir the pot,

03:38.051 --> 03:39.419
but I think that Loosey is

03:39.519 --> 03:40.887
trying to act like
she's a nice girl,

03:40.987 --> 03:42.222
and Loosey really is a bitch.

03:42.322 --> 03:44.224
If you're going to be a
bitch, just be a bitch.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.092
You don't have to
pretend to be sweet.

03:46.192 --> 03:48.027
I mean, look at me.
Eee!

03:48.895 --> 03:50.230
- Oh.
- Can you unlace

03:50.330 --> 03:53.299
my hand-made corset
that I was safe for?

03:53.399 --> 03:55.101
You never can
complain about being safe

03:55.201 --> 03:56.769
unless you're Loosey.

03:56.869 --> 03:57.837
[laughter]

03:59.038 --> 04:00.073
[singing] RuPaul's Drag Race

04:00.173 --> 04:01.307
The winner
of "RuPaul's Drag Race"

04:01.407 --> 04:02.909
receives a one-year supply

04:03.009 --> 04:05.178
of Anastasia Beverly
Hills cosmetics

04:05.278 --> 04:09.048
and a gag-worthy grand
prize of $200,000

04:09.148 --> 04:10.450
served by Cash App,

04:10.550 --> 04:13.620
with extra special
guest judge T.S Madison.

04:13.720 --> 04:14.954
[singing] RuPaul's Drag Race

04:15.054 --> 04:16.456
May the best
drag queen win

04:16.556 --> 04:18.358
Best drag queen win

04:19.993 --> 04:23.396
[upbeat music]

04:23.496 --> 04:26.432
[laughter]

04:26.532 --> 04:28.034
It's a new day
in the Werkroom,

04:28.134 --> 04:30.637
as they say,
and I'm feeling rested

04:30.737 --> 04:31.904
'cause I know that
Michelle thinks

04:32.005 --> 04:33.273
that I have
a resting bitch face,

04:33.373 --> 04:36.709
so I'm trying to be
a little bit more...

04:36.809 --> 04:38.211
smiley today.

04:38.311 --> 04:39.545
[laughs]

04:40.747 --> 04:42.849
Hello, hello, hello.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.652
- [cheering]
- Hey, Ru.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.290
Ladykids,
for today's Maxi challenge,

04:50.390 --> 04:53.192
you need to conduct
one-on-one interviews

04:53.293 --> 04:56.763
for TV's sketchiest
news magazine...

04:56.863 --> 04:58.331
"50/50."

04:58.431 --> 05:02.101
This is your chance to get up
close and personal

05:02.201 --> 05:05.004
with some
of today's most gag-worthy

05:05.104 --> 05:07.740
and uniquely
talented celebrities.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.042
Ooh.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.210
As your editor-in-queef,

05:11.311 --> 05:13.646
I'll be handing out
your assignments.

05:13.746 --> 05:16.883
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia,
and Sasha Colby,

05:16.983 --> 05:21.321
you'll be going deep with a
legendary entertainer--

05:21.421 --> 05:22.989
Charo.

05:23.089 --> 05:24.824
[laughs] Coochie, coochie.

05:24.924 --> 05:27.493
Charo is an actress.

05:27.593 --> 05:29.495
She is arguably
the world's greatest

05:29.595 --> 05:31.064
flamenco guitar player.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.598
She does cooking videos.

05:32.699 --> 05:35.468
Saffron make your
boyfriend go crazy.

05:35.568 --> 05:38.738
And she's made a fortune
off of coochie, coochie.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.007
Work, fun!

05:41.107 --> 05:43.109
Anetra, Loosey LaDuca,

05:43.209 --> 05:46.112
and Malaysia Babydoll Foxx,

05:46.212 --> 05:48.981
you'll be probing
Frankie Grande.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.516
[all screaming]

05:50.616 --> 05:52.452
Oh, I am thrilled.

05:52.552 --> 05:53.786
He's done "Big Brother."

05:53.886 --> 05:55.588
He's done
"Mamma Mia!" on Broadway.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.423
He's amazing at social media.

05:57.523 --> 05:59.992
He's Ariana's brother,
for crying out loud.

06:00.093 --> 06:03.196
And Luxx Noir London,
Mistress Isabelle Brooks,

06:03.296 --> 06:05.498
and Salina EsTittes,

06:05.598 --> 06:07.533
you need to get inside

06:07.633 --> 06:09.969
- Love Connie.
- Yes!

06:10.069 --> 06:13.506
[overlapping chatter]

06:13.606 --> 06:17.710
Love Connie is a wild
and crazy drag persona

06:17.810 --> 06:20.313
who is an aerobics fanatic.

06:20.413 --> 06:21.781
Lunge, lunge.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.916
She's been in
a couple movies.

06:24.016 --> 06:25.151
She's really fierce.

06:25.251 --> 06:29.088
Your show is going
to be broadcast live.

06:29.188 --> 06:33.493
Remember, a great interviewer
makes a real connection

06:33.593 --> 06:37.263
with her subjects and gets
them to reveal themselves

06:37.363 --> 06:39.766
in unforgettable ways.

06:39.866 --> 06:41.534
- Oh, and one more thing.
- What?

06:41.634 --> 06:44.937
Tomorrow, on the runway,
the category is

06:45.037 --> 06:48.107
Night of A Thousand Beyoncés.

06:48.207 --> 06:51.911
[all cheering]

06:52.011 --> 06:54.213
Racers, start your engines,

06:54.313 --> 06:57.316
and may the best
drag queen win.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.719
Team Love Connie.

06:59.819 --> 07:01.954
There are three
different segments.

07:02.054 --> 07:04.490
The first one is a
walk-and-talk interview.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.626
The second one is an
activity interview.

07:06.726 --> 07:09.262
And the third one is
a sit-down interview.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.164
Very Diane Sawyer tease.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.433
I would love the sit down one,

07:13.533 --> 07:15.668
just because, like, I had
a podcast in the past,

07:15.768 --> 07:17.670
and I've done a lot
of interviews and stuff.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.238
And I got something
to prove, bitch.

07:19.338 --> 07:21.073
OK, let's go.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.109
Almost everyone has a win under
their belt except for Titties.

07:23.209 --> 07:25.645
Back at home, I'm that bitch.
People know my name.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.680
So I gotta make sure that
that's what's going on here.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.616
And you know,
EsTittes can improv, honey.

07:30.716 --> 07:34.353
This is my moment to prove
myself and get a win.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.022
I mean, we have, like,
a lot to work with.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.824
We need to decipher,
like, what questions

07:37.924 --> 07:40.193
we wanna ask in each segment.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.661
That way,
it won't be repetitive.

07:41.761 --> 07:43.162
Yeah, we want
to make sure not to

07:43.262 --> 07:44.664
- overlap on our subjects.
- Yeah.

07:44.764 --> 07:46.365
He just got
married last year,

07:46.466 --> 07:47.767
so I think that it would
be a good point for me

07:47.867 --> 07:49.235
to start my interview with.

07:49.335 --> 07:51.537
Yeah, like the vegan
thing should be the pizza.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.706
So my strategy
for this interview

07:53.806 --> 07:55.908
is trying to get all
of the information

07:56.008 --> 07:58.744
so I can figure out a way
to attack this challenge.

07:58.845 --> 08:00.379
- I'm feeling good.
- We got it.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.515
- Go, Team Grande.
- Team talent.

08:02.615 --> 08:03.950
[laughter]

08:04.050 --> 08:06.118
- What a--what a personality.
- I know.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.054
Are you nervous about
being able to understand

08:08.154 --> 08:09.922
her thick accent?
Because she does a thick--

08:10.022 --> 08:10.923
A little bit.

08:11.023 --> 08:12.325
I'm a little nervous about it.

08:12.425 --> 08:14.694
Hopefully,
it won't be a problem.

08:14.794 --> 08:17.597
I'm 100% 50/50 that
we're going to nail 50/50.

08:17.697 --> 08:20.099
[laughter]

08:20.199 --> 08:21.667
What do you think of
these other bitches?

08:23.135 --> 08:25.805
Um, I'm not too sure.

08:25.905 --> 08:29.108
With the Salina,
Mistress are very loud.

08:29.208 --> 08:30.610
Well, Salina's loud.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.012
And Luxx can be a little dry.

08:33.112 --> 08:35.815
And Mistress can be kind
of, like, the wild card.

08:35.915 --> 08:37.416
- Like, she might just like...
- Uh-huh.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.785
Run them all over.

08:39.886 --> 08:41.888
Which I'm hoping.

08:41.988 --> 08:43.856
I feel, um--

08:43.956 --> 08:45.591
- [laughs] She saw us.
- She saw us.

08:45.691 --> 08:46.993
Now Marcia talking about me.

08:47.093 --> 08:47.994
Bitch, please.

08:48.094 --> 08:49.629
Ooh.

08:49.729 --> 08:50.997
Not that.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.565
We're not talking
about anybody.

08:52.665 --> 08:54.634
- Don't worry about it.
- Oh, wow.

08:54.734 --> 08:56.702
Now Marcia's starting
her bitch era.

08:56.802 --> 08:58.738
Marcia's in her villain
all right, I see.

08:58.838 --> 09:00.239
Ah!

09:00.339 --> 09:01.941
I mean, I'm happy that we
ended up with Love Connie,

09:02.041 --> 09:04.443
but I think Charo's
a good celebrity as well.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.746
But girl,
I don't know if Marcia

09:06.846 --> 09:08.180
will, like, match her energy.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.182
I bet Marcia's gonna be like,

09:10.283 --> 09:11.450
- what the fuck is happening?
- Exactly.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.319
She's gonna get
very thrown, yeah.

09:13.419 --> 09:14.954
Charo's definitely
a hard one.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.622
I do not envy
that group at all.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.024
Do you feel
you're going to give,

09:18.124 --> 09:19.091
- like, a sickening interview?
- I don't know.

09:19.191 --> 09:20.293
Maybe.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.327
I'm glad you
got Charo, though.

09:21.427 --> 09:22.595
- Why?
- 'Cause I feel like

09:22.695 --> 09:23.763
Love Connie
wears a little bit

09:23.863 --> 09:25.131
more makeup than you.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.667
There it is.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.335
Go back to your table.

09:29.435 --> 09:30.503
You're going to
be here with me.

09:30.603 --> 09:31.737
- Right here, OK?
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

09:31.837 --> 09:33.806
I'm gonna look beautiful today.

09:35.207 --> 09:36.943
Everybody set?
We're rolling.

09:37.043 --> 09:39.278
You guys look right
into this camera.

09:39.378 --> 09:42.381
It's finally time to
shoot our "50/50" segment.

09:42.481 --> 09:45.918
Now, this is live, America,
so you only get one take.

09:46.018 --> 09:47.153
Oh my God.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.655
We get to watch
other segments

09:49.755 --> 09:53.025
on a monitor in the
Werkroom, live and in color,

09:53.125 --> 09:54.660
up close and personal.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.462
We get to see what these
other girls doin'.

09:56.562 --> 09:58.230
[all exclaiming]

10:01.867 --> 10:03.736
Welcome to "50/50,"

10:03.836 --> 10:05.404
the show that keeps it 100

10:05.504 --> 10:07.073
with your favorite celebs.

10:07.173 --> 10:09.241
Everybody say love.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.743
Connie!

10:10.843 --> 10:14.647
This daring ingenue's taking
Hollywood into Connie-wood,

10:14.747 --> 10:16.649
one high kick at a time.

10:16.749 --> 10:17.750
Take a look.

10:18.851 --> 10:20.119
- Hi.
- Hello!

10:20.219 --> 10:22.321
It's so lovely to meet you.

10:22.421 --> 10:23.756
We have Love Connie
here today.

10:23.856 --> 10:26.926
Are you prepared to go deep?

10:27.026 --> 10:28.260
Ooh!

10:28.361 --> 10:30.496
[giggles] Connie, you know.

10:30.596 --> 10:32.898
Well, just a little
Sharon Stone for you,

10:32.999 --> 10:34.567
a little Catherine Tramell.

10:34.667 --> 10:35.735
So I'm curious.

10:35.835 --> 10:36.869
You came from the South.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.137
You ended up in Hollywood.

10:38.237 --> 10:39.939
What happened?
You got here.

10:40.039 --> 10:41.841
How did--what played out?

10:41.941 --> 10:45.144
Well, I had won a couple of
local pageants in Louisiana.

10:45.244 --> 10:48.047
And I was currently
representing Miss Stockshow,

10:48.147 --> 10:50.816
which is, you know,
you model in a swimsuit

10:50.916 --> 10:52.852
and then show
your prize heifer.

10:52.952 --> 10:54.620
She goes on these
wild tangents,

10:54.720 --> 10:56.589
and I never know when
they're going to end.

10:56.689 --> 11:00.059
The bus ticket only got me
as far as Waxahachie, Texas,

11:00.159 --> 11:01.861
- but, uh...
- Tell me the story

11:01.961 --> 11:04.263
about a prosthetic leg.

11:04.363 --> 11:06.799
I saw that they were having
a leg wrestling contest

11:06.899 --> 11:08.634
at this local bar,

11:08.734 --> 11:11.971
and I thought, honey,
these gams, baby?

11:12.071 --> 11:15.508
So I'm finding myself having
to, like, pause, be patient.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.544
That's how you talk

11:18.644 --> 11:20.012
- to squirrels, by the way.
- Is it really?

11:20.112 --> 11:22.515
Because I don't know
when she's going to stop.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.016
I'm so curious.

11:24.116 --> 11:25.818
Like, you've achieved
so much in your career.

11:25.918 --> 11:27.219
What's next for Connie?

11:27.319 --> 11:28.487
Oh my God.

11:28.587 --> 11:30.856
Well, I would love my own show.

11:32.058 --> 11:33.726
I mean, I've still
got all my teeth.

11:33.826 --> 11:35.027
I've still got a great rack.

11:35.127 --> 11:36.696
I haven't had
these babies done.

11:36.796 --> 11:39.098
So I just say I'm just
going to get better with age,

11:39.198 --> 11:42.768
if I could only just
get my own show.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.505
I hitched a ride with
the queen of gal-isthenics,

11:46.605 --> 11:48.974
and honey, it got fierce.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.242
Take a look.

11:51.343 --> 11:52.511
Hey, Connie, girl.

11:52.611 --> 11:54.980
- Hi, love.
- You have room for one more?

11:55.081 --> 11:57.783
You know Aunt Connie is
running the kitty car today.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.118
You know, we're at "50/50."

11:59.218 --> 12:00.619
We gotta see the nitty gritty.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.388
Your nemesis, Candy.

12:02.488 --> 12:05.558
- Candy Hernandez?
- Candy Hernandez.

12:06.959 --> 12:10.129
How did you meet Candy,
and how did this feud start?

12:10.229 --> 12:13.232
Candy Hernandez
pulled a fast one on me.

12:13.332 --> 12:16.535
I hate Candy Hernandez!

12:16.635 --> 12:18.070
Oh, I'm so sorry.

12:18.170 --> 12:19.238
[horn blares]

12:19.338 --> 12:21.507
- [laughter]
- Oh my god.

12:21.607 --> 12:25.511
Love Connie is a very
unpredictable person.

12:25.611 --> 12:27.413
- Pedal to the metal!
- Whoo!

12:29.515 --> 12:31.417
So I'm rolling
with the punches.

12:31.517 --> 12:34.453
I will drive this interview and
this golf cart if I have to.

12:34.553 --> 12:36.555
I'm loving this golf cart.

12:36.655 --> 12:38.457
Honey, I don't know
anything about golf,

12:38.557 --> 12:41.026
but all I know is I love
some balls on the nine hole.

12:41.127 --> 12:42.027
Oh, yes.

12:42.128 --> 12:43.462
I love it.

12:43.562 --> 12:45.598
I'm sure you had a great
time driving those golf carts

12:45.698 --> 12:47.399
on the set of Legally Blonde.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.801
How was that?

12:48.901 --> 12:50.536
It was fabulous.

12:50.636 --> 12:52.538
I loved you in
the role of Maurice.

12:52.638 --> 12:54.473
- Oh my God.
- The hairdresser.

12:54.573 --> 12:56.375
You have really been
doing your research.

12:56.475 --> 12:58.377
You know, when you
had that iconic line,

12:58.477 --> 13:01.881
"Oh my God, the bend and snap.
It works every time."

13:01.981 --> 13:04.083
- Do you know what we could do?
- What could we do?

13:04.183 --> 13:05.217
We could blow this joint.

13:05.317 --> 13:06.852
- [gasps] Let's go.
- In fact,

13:06.952 --> 13:08.854
- let's get outta here!
- Where are we going?

13:08.954 --> 13:09.955
Move these guys.

13:11.157 --> 13:13.392
Mayday!
Out of control golf cart.

13:13.492 --> 13:15.194
Somebody call
Ghostbusters, please.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.629
Who are you gonna call?

13:16.729 --> 13:18.297
Oh my God.
No brakes!

13:18.397 --> 13:20.065
No, there's no brakes!

13:20.166 --> 13:21.600
Did you have any
more questions for me

13:21.700 --> 13:22.802
before we die?

13:22.902 --> 13:24.603
Um, what's your
favorite food?

13:24.703 --> 13:26.338
- [queens cackle]
- We're gonna die,

13:26.438 --> 13:28.874
and I'm wearing
my grandmother's panties.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.510
Grab the wheel!
Oh my God!

13:32.344 --> 13:33.245
[crashing]

13:33.345 --> 13:34.446
- Oh!
- Oh.

13:34.547 --> 13:35.881
[upbeat theme music]

13:35.981 --> 13:37.783
I had the
opportunity to satisfy

13:37.883 --> 13:39.518
my sweet tooth with Connie

13:39.618 --> 13:43.088
as we discussed
her passion for icing cakes.

13:43.189 --> 13:44.456
Take a look.

13:45.591 --> 13:47.193
We've got some
lovely cupcakes here.

13:47.293 --> 13:48.627
Do you want to,
like, decorate any?

13:48.727 --> 13:49.795
Is that what we're doing?

13:49.895 --> 13:51.063
Of course.
Walk us through--

13:51.163 --> 13:52.898
you know,
we're here to take a look

13:52.998 --> 13:54.266
into your favorite pastime.

13:54.366 --> 13:57.102
Now, I think most people
would be shocked to know

13:57.203 --> 13:58.504
that you
love to frost cupcakes.

13:58.604 --> 14:00.439
Connie makes her own
little chocolate drops

14:00.539 --> 14:01.874
from her own little factory.

14:01.974 --> 14:04.276
Now, I know you
have a sweet tooth.

14:04.376 --> 14:07.346
What's your secret to keeping
your dynamite figure, baby?

14:07.446 --> 14:09.849
Oh, look.
I'm good at this.

14:09.949 --> 14:11.984
You can do all kinds
of little designs.

14:12.084 --> 14:13.552
What is that, a rosebud?

14:13.652 --> 14:15.421
Or a prolapse.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.189
The bitch
is crazier than I ever

14:17.289 --> 14:18.490
thought she was going to be.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.292
What is the most
rewarding project

14:20.392 --> 14:22.428
you've had the opportunity
to work on in your career?

14:22.528 --> 14:24.530
I keep thinking
I have been scratching

14:24.630 --> 14:26.165
my ass or something here.

14:26.265 --> 14:28.234
I don't know what is going on.

14:29.401 --> 14:31.670
Oh, no.

14:31.770 --> 14:34.206
Mistress doesn't know how
to fucking read this bitch.

14:34.306 --> 14:35.341
That's real tea.

14:35.441 --> 14:38.277
Honey, draw a vagina.

14:38.377 --> 14:42.081
Miss Connie is sending Miss
Mistress for a fucking loop.

14:42.181 --> 14:43.349
[laughs]

14:43.449 --> 14:44.950
I took jazz classes

14:45.050 --> 14:47.786
with fucking
Elizabeth Berkley, too.

14:49.021 --> 14:50.723
Well, thank you so much,
Love Connie.

14:50.823 --> 14:53.092
It has been an amazing journey.

14:53.192 --> 14:54.660
And I feel like I
know you even more.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.095
- Oh, really?
- I do.

14:56.195 --> 14:57.730
Well, I've lied
about everything

14:57.830 --> 14:59.331
I talked about today.

14:59.431 --> 15:00.733
You don't really
know me at all.

15:00.833 --> 15:04.169
What makes you think
I won't cut you?

15:04.270 --> 15:06.338
Scene!

15:06.438 --> 15:08.941
Thank you for
joining us on "50/50."

15:09.041 --> 15:09.942
all: Good night.

15:10.042 --> 15:11.043
[laughter]

15:11.143 --> 15:12.211
And we're clear.

15:12.311 --> 15:13.913
- Thank you, ladies.
- Thank you.

15:14.013 --> 15:15.681
When my segment is over,

15:15.781 --> 15:18.784
I cannot help but breathe
a big sigh of relief.

15:18.884 --> 15:21.120
[sighs]

15:21.220 --> 15:23.022
And I'm about
to go learn to lip sync

15:23.122 --> 15:24.924
because I feel like
I'm in the bottom.

15:26.759 --> 15:31.764
[upbeat music]

15:32.498 --> 15:34.333
Welcome to 50/50,

15:34.433 --> 15:35.734
a show that gives you

15:35.834 --> 15:37.303
50% sosh...

15:37.403 --> 15:38.771
And 50% mosh.

15:38.871 --> 15:42.207
Today, we are talking
to the legendary Charo.

15:42.308 --> 15:45.477
I got a chance to make
a salad with Charo.

15:45.577 --> 15:46.578
Take a look.

15:47.446 --> 15:48.714
- Hi!
- Mwa, mwa.

15:48.814 --> 15:49.715
Oh my gosh.

15:49.815 --> 15:50.816
I love you so much.

15:50.916 --> 15:52.217
Oh, I'm so excited.

15:52.318 --> 15:54.253
We gonna make
a hell of a salad.

15:54.353 --> 15:56.255
- Before we start cooking...
- Uh-huh.

15:56.355 --> 15:58.090
I know you come from Hawaii.

15:58.190 --> 15:59.858
- I am from Hawaii, yeah.
- Aloha.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.293
And you've lived in
Hawaii for a long time.

16:01.393 --> 16:02.561
I live in Hawaii. OK.

16:02.661 --> 16:04.563
Let's say something
right now to everybody.

16:04.663 --> 16:07.266
[speaking Hawaiian]

16:08.267 --> 16:09.368
You know what that means?

16:09.468 --> 16:11.804
"Your crazy pig
is eating my papaya."

16:13.772 --> 16:15.007
Interacting with Charo--

16:15.107 --> 16:16.608
it's--it's half fangirling.

16:16.709 --> 16:17.810
Coochie coochie.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.411
Chef Coochie.

16:19.511 --> 16:20.813
Oh my gosh, I get to
witness it in person.

16:20.913 --> 16:23.315
And half of, oh,
this is a challenge.

16:23.415 --> 16:25.150
I tell you where we go

16:25.250 --> 16:27.653
when you got
everything you see here--

16:27.753 --> 16:30.122
you pretend that you are a cat.

16:31.123 --> 16:32.191
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

16:32.291 --> 16:33.625
Meow, meow, meow.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.494
[laughter]

16:35.594 --> 16:37.229
[indistinct chatter]

16:37.329 --> 16:40.532
[laughter]

16:40.632 --> 16:42.501
I'm a big fan of
all your variety appearances

16:42.601 --> 16:44.570
like in "Carol Burnett"
and "Sonny and Cher."

16:44.670 --> 16:46.839
How was it working, like,
being so well-rounded?

16:46.939 --> 16:48.640
You had to do
acting and comedy.

16:48.741 --> 16:49.908
I juggling.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.078
Then, one day, I was in
Cohasset, Massachusetts,

16:53.178 --> 16:55.280
and I open my legs,
and I get pregnant.

16:55.381 --> 16:57.616
Oh!
[laughs] Just like that.

16:57.716 --> 17:00.586
She [indistinct] they say
the hell I'm talking about.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.888
In all these years,
who needs this?

17:02.988 --> 17:04.990
[all cackling]

17:05.090 --> 17:06.025
I follow you on Instagram.

17:06.125 --> 17:08.594
Follow her at OfficialCharo.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.862
Coochie, coochie, Charo.

17:09.962 --> 17:12.131
I mean,
this interview is chaotic.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.298
Very good.

17:13.399 --> 17:14.500
It look like you
had done that before.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.335
I've tossed
a salad in my day.

17:16.435 --> 17:17.870
Behave, my child.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.239
But listen, Miss Sasha
is hanging in there.

17:20.339 --> 17:21.974
[speaking Hawaiian]

17:23.108 --> 17:24.877
"Cappa puy poo-ha-ah."

17:24.977 --> 17:27.413
At the end of my segment,
to sum it all up,

17:27.513 --> 17:32.518
I would have to say, your
crazy pig is eating my papaya.

17:33.185 --> 17:33.619
- Salud.
- Salud.

17:33.719 --> 17:34.887
Aloha.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.588
- Coochie coochie.
- Coochie coochie.

17:37.856 --> 17:40.025
I had a heartfelt
conversation with Charo

17:40.125 --> 17:42.661
where I got some pretty
incredible life advice.

17:42.761 --> 17:44.229
Let's take a look.

17:45.264 --> 17:46.165
Mwa.

17:46.265 --> 17:47.332
Mwa.

17:47.433 --> 17:48.934
I have to say,
sitting across from you

17:49.034 --> 17:50.936
is pretty incredible.

17:51.036 --> 17:53.906
You've had a long
and illustrious career.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.641
Upon arrival,
you were kind of branded

17:55.741 --> 17:57.509
as the coochie coochie girl.

17:57.609 --> 17:59.845
Do you ever feel that that
limited you in any way

17:59.945 --> 18:01.180
in your career?

18:01.280 --> 18:03.649
Coochie coochie
be my fun,

18:03.749 --> 18:06.251
but I reached a point in my
life that I had to change.

18:06.351 --> 18:07.653
Uh-huh.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.222
I'm going to play a city,
just break it down.

18:10.322 --> 18:12.991
And they said, you're
going to get broke.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.028
I feel like Marcia's having
a little bit of a hard time

18:16.128 --> 18:17.529
understanding Charo.

18:17.629 --> 18:20.933
The bigger down low
in my soul city.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.469
Baby, you name it, online.

18:24.736 --> 18:26.171
Girl, all my aunties
talk like that,

18:26.271 --> 18:27.406
so I could
understand everything

18:27.506 --> 18:28.640
that she was saying,

18:28.740 --> 18:30.275
and it was just Marcia
like this for me.

18:33.011 --> 18:33.912
Oh.

18:34.012 --> 18:35.614
[laughs]

18:35.714 --> 18:37.182
I wish you grew up like me.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.651
I grew up free, like bird.

18:39.751 --> 18:41.220
- It sounds like it.
- I was.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.288
You know the pleasure
to sleep on a tree?

18:43.388 --> 18:44.990
Mm-hmm.

18:45.090 --> 18:46.091
Well, don't do it now.

18:47.726 --> 18:48.927
What is she doing
on top of a tree?

18:49.027 --> 18:49.928
They call the police.

18:50.028 --> 18:51.563
Oh, great.
[laughs]

18:51.663 --> 18:53.966
We have one final
question for you, Charo.

18:54.066 --> 18:55.267
OK. Ask me.

18:55.367 --> 18:57.136
It's the one that is
on everybody's lips.

18:57.236 --> 18:58.203
Yeah.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.239
How old are you really?

19:00.339 --> 19:02.574
That's a helluva
good question, Marcia.

19:02.674 --> 19:04.409
- I am an old bitch.
- Uh-huh.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.912
According to
my latest record...

19:08.213 --> 19:10.983
I came to America with
Christopher Columbus.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.051
[laughs]

19:13.152 --> 19:15.354
And he was hot.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.523
Thank you for joining us

19:17.623 --> 19:18.957
on "50/50."

19:19.057 --> 19:19.958
And remember...

19:20.058 --> 19:21.693
If you can't love yourself...

19:21.793 --> 19:23.795
How the hell are you gonna...

19:23.896 --> 19:24.796
Coochie, coochie,

19:24.897 --> 19:29.902
coochie, coochie, coochie?

19:32.337 --> 19:34.139
We're here today

19:34.239 --> 19:35.541
with Frankie Grande.

19:35.641 --> 19:36.575
I sit down with the

19:36.675 --> 19:37.976
dancing queen himself.

19:38.076 --> 19:39.811
Let's take a look.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.247
Now, first of all, I
have to congratulate you.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.149
- Yes.
- You are a married man now.

19:44.249 --> 19:46.318
- I am a married man.
- Oh you did good.

19:46.418 --> 19:47.719
Thank you.

19:47.819 --> 19:49.388
- I knew you would.
- Thank you so much, honey.

19:49.488 --> 19:52.090
Now, you had a little
bit of a brush with death.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.727
You had a near-fatal... bite.

19:55.827 --> 20:00.065
I need to hear about this
because it is my worst fear.

20:00.165 --> 20:02.834
I was doing a lot of
charity work in South Africa.

20:02.935 --> 20:06.038
And I went to a
medicine man's hut--

20:06.138 --> 20:08.740
well, I think he
sensed my skepticism,

20:08.840 --> 20:11.109
and I think he stuck
a spider on me.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.744
'Cause I looked down,
and there was a spider,

20:12.844 --> 20:14.279
and it bit me.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.382
On the flight home, my leg blew
up to the size of a balloon.

20:17.482 --> 20:20.052
And the CDC came and gave me,
like, a special juice.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.253
And then I went down in, like...

20:21.353 --> 20:23.388
- Horrifying.
- An hour.

20:23.488 --> 20:25.757
Now, on a happier note,
I know you're a huge

20:25.857 --> 20:27.593
- sci-fi fan, right?
- Yes, huge sci-fi--

20:27.693 --> 20:28.894
Favorite sci-fi
movie of all time?

20:28.994 --> 20:30.562
- "Aliens."
- Is "Aliens" the one

20:30.662 --> 20:31.897
- with the big robot?
- Yes.

20:31.997 --> 20:33.865
"Get away from her...
both: You bitch!"

20:33.966 --> 20:35.267
[laughter]

20:35.367 --> 20:36.969
This role
was built for Loosey.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.404
Barbara Walters, Steve--
I'm like, that is literally

20:39.504 --> 20:41.240
Loosey's character of drag.

20:41.340 --> 20:43.275
So she has this in the bag.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.377
I love, love, love.
We gotta get her on the show.

20:45.477 --> 20:46.945
- We'll do a three-way...
- Oh.

20:47.045 --> 20:48.547
- Interview.
- That sounds great.

20:48.647 --> 20:49.948
Or whatever.
You know what I mean?

20:50.048 --> 20:50.949
Yeah, three-way whatever.

20:51.049 --> 20:54.286
A three-way whatever.

20:54.386 --> 20:55.721
I visited Frankie on set,

20:55.821 --> 20:58.457
where we chatted about life
on and off screen,

20:58.557 --> 21:00.292
and nothing was off limits.

21:03.061 --> 21:03.962
Well, hello.

21:04.062 --> 21:06.265
[both screaming]

21:06.365 --> 21:07.299
Power walking.

21:07.399 --> 21:08.567
Do you power walk often?

21:08.667 --> 21:10.836
I am so obsessed with
getting my steps up

21:10.936 --> 21:12.738
that sometimes
I'll just swing my arms.

21:12.838 --> 21:14.706
What else do you like
to do other than that?

21:14.806 --> 21:17.009
I'm actually weighting
and lifting now.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.277
- Are you really?
- A whole new thing.

21:18.377 --> 21:19.511
I'm married now.

21:19.611 --> 21:20.946
How long have
you been married?

21:21.046 --> 21:22.547
I've been married for a month
when this is being filmed.

21:22.648 --> 21:23.782
- A month?
- I know.

21:23.882 --> 21:25.951
- Congratulations.
- Isn't that crazy?

21:27.719 --> 21:29.454
Anetra I was the
most nervous about

21:29.554 --> 21:30.822
just because I know
she's really quiet.

21:30.922 --> 21:32.391
Do some grapevines,
back steps.

21:32.491 --> 21:33.992
I just want to
show off my legs.

21:34.092 --> 21:35.160
Oh my God.

21:35.260 --> 21:36.662
I look like
I'm in "The Music Man."

21:36.762 --> 21:38.897
And she's surprising me.

21:38.997 --> 21:40.999
When did you come out?

21:41.099 --> 21:45.203
I came out when
I was 21 years old.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.738
I actually came out to
my fraternity first.

21:46.838 --> 21:48.040
Wow.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.541
Sigma Phi Epsilon,
shout out to y'all.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.276
You ran so we could strut.

21:51.376 --> 21:54.146
[laughs] And there were
many people before me.

21:54.246 --> 21:55.647
Yas. Period.

21:55.747 --> 21:58.050
Well, thank you for
exhausting yourself

21:58.150 --> 21:59.351
and stretching my legs.

21:59.451 --> 22:01.253
- I hit my goal.
- You did?

22:01.353 --> 22:02.387
Yay!

22:02.487 --> 22:04.756
Work. Bam!

22:06.091 --> 22:07.092
After working up quite

22:07.192 --> 22:08.160
an appetite with Anetra,

22:08.260 --> 22:09.428
I got the chance to visit

22:09.528 --> 22:10.629
Frankie in his kitchen.

22:10.729 --> 22:11.830
Mm.

22:11.930 --> 22:13.732
Let's check
it out.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.400
[Italian accent] Ciao,
welcome to my kitchen.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.668
Oh, I'm so happy to be here.

22:16.768 --> 22:18.570
It was so nice for you
to come to my kitchen.

22:18.670 --> 22:21.006
This is Frankie Grande's
Pizza Kitchen.

22:21.106 --> 22:23.041
- Starting with the dough...
- OK.

22:23.141 --> 22:25.310
You just want to start with
the spinning and the tossing.

22:25.410 --> 22:26.712
- Are we ready?
- Uh...

22:26.812 --> 22:28.780
[giggles] Here we go.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.182
So you want to pull
it apart a little bit.

22:30.282 --> 22:31.183
And you want to spin and toss. OK.

22:31.283 --> 22:32.184
- There we go.
- OK.

22:32.284 --> 22:33.652
Here we go.

22:33.752 --> 22:34.586
This should have been a
challenge on "Big Brother."

22:34.686 --> 22:36.088
I would have won.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.622
Now we're going to put
on the tomato sauce.

22:37.723 --> 22:39.224
- A little sauce?
- Yeah, a little sauce.

22:39.324 --> 22:40.692
- A little saucey.
- You know, that's great.

22:40.792 --> 22:41.693
That's a great shape.

22:41.793 --> 22:43.028
I love a square pizza.

22:43.128 --> 22:44.830
Whatever shape
you have in your heart.

22:44.930 --> 22:46.565
I should have did a heart.

22:46.665 --> 22:47.899
- Speaking of hearts...
- Yes.

22:47.999 --> 22:49.368
- Speaking of hearts.
- Oh, yes, please.

22:49.468 --> 22:52.404
I know that you just recently
got, you know, married.

22:52.504 --> 22:54.005
Does he enjoy your meatballs?

22:54.106 --> 22:55.774
Oh, he certainly does.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.376
Are they spicy meatballs?

22:57.476 --> 22:58.977
They are spicy
Italian meatballs.

22:59.077 --> 23:01.413
Welcome to
Frankini's kitchen, baby.

23:01.513 --> 23:03.148
Oh, mwa.
He's interviewing Malaysia

23:03.248 --> 23:05.217
more than Malaysia's
interviewing Frankie.

23:05.317 --> 23:07.953
Are you, uh, preferring the
one on the right or the left?

23:08.053 --> 23:11.189
- Um...
- AKA, are you a size queen?

23:11.289 --> 23:13.759
I don't really see Malaysia
shining in this moment.

23:13.859 --> 23:16.094
[Italian accent] Frankie,
we got the pizza going,

23:16.194 --> 23:17.929
and we're going to
put it in the oven.

23:19.431 --> 23:22.167
Bitch,
this is a hot-ass mess.

23:22.267 --> 23:23.635
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.937
425 degrees.

23:26.037 --> 23:28.707
I don't know what's worse,
the conversation and dialogue,

23:28.807 --> 23:31.143
or Malaysia's synthetic bob.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.644
Mmm.

23:32.744 --> 23:34.079
Mmm.

23:34.179 --> 23:36.615
[both mmm-ing]

23:39.684 --> 23:40.685
Thank you for joining us

23:40.786 --> 23:42.487
on "50/50."

23:42.587 --> 23:43.922
I'm like, oh, shit.

23:44.022 --> 23:46.258
I'm just hoping that somebody
else did worse than me.

23:46.358 --> 23:47.626
Oh.

23:51.730 --> 23:53.532
Ooh!

23:53.632 --> 23:55.200
Y'all ready for Beyoncé?

23:55.300 --> 23:56.802
Girl, we're ready to
get up into the geek.

23:56.902 --> 23:58.470
Beyoncé.

23:58.570 --> 24:01.706
Category is Night of
A Thousand Beyoncés,

24:01.807 --> 24:04.142
or Night of Eight Beyoncés.

24:04.242 --> 24:05.310
Beyoncé Knowles.

24:06.511 --> 24:08.013
Elimination
is happening tonight.

24:08.113 --> 24:11.583
And I'm on thin ice, but
I'ma still snatch this mug.

24:11.683 --> 24:13.318
I'ma going to give
my Beyoncé fantasy,

24:13.418 --> 24:15.353
and we will just see
how this plays out.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.023
So fun fact,
y'all, every time

24:18.123 --> 24:20.959
everybody asks me what's your
name, I'm like, oh, Sasha.

24:21.059 --> 24:22.928
And they're like, oh, Sasha
Fierce, just like Beyoncé.

24:23.028 --> 24:26.431
I'm like, well, I was Sasha
before the album came out.

24:26.531 --> 24:27.933
[laughter]

24:28.033 --> 24:30.135
For the record, Sasha Colby
came before Sasha Fierce.

24:30.235 --> 24:32.170
Just going to put
that out there.

24:32.270 --> 24:34.739
And I have, like,
a conspiracy theory

24:34.840 --> 24:36.608
that because I knew
some of the dancers

24:36.708 --> 24:39.110
back when she did the Sasha
Fierce thing, then, like,

24:39.211 --> 24:42.180
they are good friends of
mine, so I was like, hmm.

24:42.280 --> 24:43.949
Interesting.

24:44.049 --> 24:47.919
Maybe, like, she could
have seen me at one point,

24:48.019 --> 24:50.288
and, like--

24:51.656 --> 24:54.159
Maybe Beyoncé may have
seen one of my performances

24:54.259 --> 24:57.229
and thought that that
was fierce, Sasha.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.497
Sasha Fierce.

24:58.597 --> 25:01.099
I'm just going to say,
and until Beyoncé

25:01.199 --> 25:03.735
tells me to my face that it's
a lie, I'm going to keep it.

25:03.835 --> 25:06.204
I'm gagged at this
story right now.

25:06.304 --> 25:07.639
Sasha, what?

25:07.739 --> 25:09.407
So that's an
invitation for Beyoncé

25:09.508 --> 25:10.642
to come talk to me, babe.

25:10.742 --> 25:12.511
- I believe it.
- Wow.

25:14.079 --> 25:17.482
What a lovely fairy tale.

25:17.582 --> 25:18.917
[laughs]

25:19.017 --> 25:20.785
Oh, Beyoncé, a legend.

25:22.721 --> 25:26.024
["Covergirl" begins]

25:31.096 --> 25:33.932
[RuPaul laughing]

25:36.034 --> 25:39.404
[singing] Covergirl,
put the bass in your walk

25:39.504 --> 25:43.608
[singing] Head to toe,
let your whole body talk

25:43.708 --> 25:46.111
And... what?

25:46.211 --> 25:48.680
Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race"

25:48.780 --> 25:51.082
Michelle Visage

25:51.182 --> 25:53.518
and media mogul T.S. Madison.

25:53.618 --> 25:55.420
This week,
we challenged our queens

25:55.520 --> 25:59.891
to show off their interviewing
skills on "50/50."

25:59.991 --> 26:02.661
And tonight on the runway,
category is

26:02.761 --> 26:05.931
Night of a Thousand Beyoncés.

26:06.031 --> 26:08.066
Racers, start your engines,

26:08.166 --> 26:10.569
and may the best
drag queen win.

26:11.670 --> 26:15.173
[singing] The run
is your runway

26:16.274 --> 26:19.177
Up first, Luxx Noir London

26:19.277 --> 26:22.881
at the 2006
Kennedy Center Honors

26:22.981 --> 26:24.182
honoring Tina Turner.

26:24.282 --> 26:26.551
I am serving
a direct recreation

26:26.651 --> 26:28.553
of a Bob Mackie dress.

26:28.653 --> 26:30.455
Perfection,
10s across the board.

26:30.555 --> 26:32.490
But what else can
you expect from me?

26:32.591 --> 26:35.393
You're born naked,
and the rest is Bob Mackie.

26:35.493 --> 26:36.561
Amen.

26:36.661 --> 26:38.763
Mistress Isabelle Brooks.

26:38.863 --> 26:42.601
At the 2001 Grammy Awards.

26:42.701 --> 26:45.103
Oh, Michelle,
can you handle this?

26:45.203 --> 26:47.939
Yes, I can.

26:48.039 --> 26:49.975
I love Destiny's Child-era
Beyoncé.

26:50.075 --> 26:51.309
We are independent women.

26:51.409 --> 26:52.744
We are survivors.

26:52.844 --> 26:56.114
And, Ru, we can pay my
bill, bill, bills, OK?

26:56.214 --> 26:57.716
Destiny's conjoined triplets.

26:57.816 --> 26:59.751
[laughter]

26:59.851 --> 27:04.789
Salina EsTittes
at the 2004 Grammy Awards.

27:05.991 --> 27:08.793
My Grammys today are
the RuPaul Chia Pets.

27:08.893 --> 27:11.096
Baby, I feel sexy.
I feel glamour.

27:11.196 --> 27:12.764
I feel gorgeous and beautiful.

27:12.864 --> 27:14.265
Bitch, I'm Beyoncé.

27:14.366 --> 27:17.435
I'd like to thank the
Academy, the hair academy.

27:19.838 --> 27:24.476
Sasha Colby at
the 2006 BET Awards.

27:24.576 --> 27:28.713
Ooh, is that a Tina Knowles
original, a TKO?

27:28.813 --> 27:31.750
I am in my Deja Vu era.

27:31.850 --> 27:35.854
I'm giving you body-ody-ody
'cause no one else can.

27:35.954 --> 27:38.623
I'm giving you "Be-yon-cé."

27:38.723 --> 27:41.993
Sasha Colby is Sasha Fierce.

27:42.093 --> 27:43.395
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia,

27:43.495 --> 27:47.165
at the Title X
Brooklyn 2017 charity event.

27:47.265 --> 27:50.001
Baby, I'm drunk
in love with this.

27:50.101 --> 27:52.537
I'm a vision
in emerald green.

27:52.637 --> 27:54.706
I look soft to the touch,

27:54.806 --> 27:57.409
and I've got
Beyoncé's half up, half down.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.944
This ponytail could
stand up all by itself.

28:00.045 --> 28:01.813
Yeah, I'm giving
this the green light.

28:02.947 --> 28:06.084
Anetra, the On the Run tour.

28:06.184 --> 28:08.286
Bow down, bitches.

28:08.386 --> 28:10.722
I'm trying to give you
all of this attitude,

28:10.822 --> 28:12.724
the stomp, presence.

28:12.824 --> 28:14.759
The waist is waisting,
the hips are hipping,

28:14.859 --> 28:16.528
and the breasts are breasting.

28:16.628 --> 28:19.297
- All hell Queen B.
- That's it.

28:19.397 --> 28:24.402
Malaysia Babydoll Foxx, the
2018 Global Citizens Festival.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.973
It's god, honey.
Black is King.

28:29.074 --> 28:30.909
Baby, I'm giving you curves.

28:31.009 --> 28:33.411
I'm giving you big thighs
because they save lives.

28:33.511 --> 28:35.847
It's just very fashion forward.

28:35.947 --> 28:37.415
I feel like it's a look.

28:37.515 --> 28:40.151
She got love on
top and bottom.

28:41.820 --> 28:45.957
Loosey LaDuca, the 2011 VMAs.

28:46.057 --> 28:49.861
I have chosen the iconic
performance of "Love on Top"

28:49.961 --> 28:53.364
and the big reveal of
the Beyoncé baby bump.

28:53.465 --> 28:56.234
What to expect when
you're expecting Beyoncé.

28:57.702 --> 29:00.672
I am letting my hair
just bounce in the wind.

29:00.772 --> 29:01.973
If you don't have
wind in the hair,

29:02.073 --> 29:03.975
you are not Beyoncé, sweetheart.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.810
Oh, ain't no
more single ladies.

29:09.214 --> 29:10.415
Welcome, Queens.

29:10.515 --> 29:12.851
I've made some decisions.

29:14.519 --> 29:16.621
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia,

29:16.721 --> 29:19.524
Anetra, you are both safe.

29:21.626 --> 29:23.194
You may leave the stage.

29:26.931 --> 29:30.268
Ladies, now it's time for
the judges' critiques.

29:31.870 --> 29:35.373
Starting with Luxx Noir London.

29:35.473 --> 29:36.708
Hi.

29:36.808 --> 29:38.009
You had a tough one.

29:38.109 --> 29:40.645
Love Connie will just
throw anything at you.

29:40.745 --> 29:42.747
Pedal to the metal!

29:42.847 --> 29:44.616
And I thought you
handled it really well.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.618
I thought the way you
interviewed was genuine,

29:46.718 --> 29:48.386
and I liked your
line of questioning.

29:48.486 --> 29:49.888
And you brought things back.

29:49.988 --> 29:51.856
You were kind of matching
Connie tit for tat,

29:51.956 --> 29:53.525
and I enjoyed that.

29:53.625 --> 29:54.826
This is an iconic
look for you.

29:54.926 --> 29:56.728
[squeals] - It's great.

29:56.828 --> 29:59.397
I'm sure Mr. Mackie
will love that, too.

29:59.497 --> 30:00.765
I hope he does.

30:00.865 --> 30:02.400
And a little trivia.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.769
The outfit that Beyoncé wore--

30:04.869 --> 30:08.673
I actually wore that dress
to an event years ago.

30:08.773 --> 30:11.609
The outfit was made
for Linda Carter.

30:11.709 --> 30:13.578
- You look great, kiddo.
- Thank you.

30:13.678 --> 30:15.446
I really, really
appreciate that.

30:15.547 --> 30:18.716
Up next,
Mistress Isabelle Brooks.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.685
Let's start in the kitchen.

30:20.785 --> 30:23.488
I was a little
disappointed because you

30:23.588 --> 30:25.890
want to make the audience
do this stuff with you.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.325
I'm good at this.

30:27.425 --> 30:29.961
Some of the warmth of
relating over the food

30:30.061 --> 30:31.062
was missing.

30:31.162 --> 30:32.797
But this, I love.

30:32.897 --> 30:36.701
And I think tonight
is so particularly you

30:36.801 --> 30:40.038
with the joke,
but done in glamour.

30:40.138 --> 30:42.106
You know how to paint,
but I think

30:42.207 --> 30:44.876
this is the most beautiful
you have ever looked.

30:44.976 --> 30:46.177
Thank you.

30:46.277 --> 30:47.912
This look is your
destiny, child.

30:48.012 --> 30:50.748
[laughter]

30:50.849 --> 30:53.484
Up next, Salina EsTittes.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.587
- You look so pretty tonight.
- Thank you.

30:55.687 --> 30:58.256
This honey hair color
is so beautiful on you.

30:58.356 --> 30:59.791
I love it.

30:59.891 --> 31:02.126
In your challenge, you had
some really strong moments.

31:02.227 --> 31:05.897
I think when you started losing
me was you kept talking over.

31:05.997 --> 31:08.633
- But, uh--
- Tell me the story...

31:08.733 --> 31:11.169
I was going to ask a lot
more deeper questions,

31:11.269 --> 31:13.071
but she was going
off the deep end.

31:13.171 --> 31:15.173
So I was just like,
how can I pick the ball up

31:15.273 --> 31:16.608
with where she's going?

31:16.708 --> 31:18.176
And then I would be
like, oh, my God,

31:18.276 --> 31:19.844
uh, this because you said it.

31:19.944 --> 31:21.779
You were stuck
in your head a bit,

31:21.880 --> 31:23.715
and you can never let
what's going on in your head

31:23.815 --> 31:24.916
show on your face.

31:25.016 --> 31:26.517
Honey, you gotta treat that

31:26.618 --> 31:28.152
like an ugly piece
of trade, girl.

31:28.253 --> 31:31.656
You got to be like...
you cute, you know?

31:32.991 --> 31:34.292
Yeah, I was, like, probably
just stuck in my head

31:34.392 --> 31:35.760
- thinking of the next...
- Yeah.

31:35.860 --> 31:37.629
- Thing to say
- It's a rookie mistake.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.899
The key to interviewing
is listening.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.669
Up next, Sasha Colby.

31:44.769 --> 31:46.804
Tonight on the runway,
it's almost

31:46.905 --> 31:48.706
identical to what B. wore.

31:48.806 --> 31:49.974
It's just wonderful.

31:50.074 --> 31:51.509
- In the challenge...
- Coochie, coochie.

31:51.609 --> 31:52.777
Chef Coochie.

31:52.877 --> 31:57.315
You have Charo, who
has big dick energy, OK?

31:58.783 --> 32:01.352
You matched it enough
without trying to one-up her,

32:01.452 --> 32:03.755
but your generosity
with her is what you

32:03.855 --> 32:05.156
need with somebody like her.

32:05.256 --> 32:08.059
And your ease with letting
her be her,

32:08.159 --> 32:11.062
just going
with it--that felt so good.

32:11.162 --> 32:12.897
My favorite part--
you throwing the cards away,

32:12.997 --> 32:14.899
which let the audience know

32:14.999 --> 32:16.534
we're going to have
some fun here.

32:16.634 --> 32:19.203
But what I liked the
most, you and Charo

32:19.304 --> 32:21.172
both spoke to the audience.

32:21.272 --> 32:23.141
You acknowledged me
as a viewer.

32:23.241 --> 32:25.910
Have you hosted
television before?

32:26.010 --> 32:27.578
- In my dreams.
- Oh.

32:27.679 --> 32:28.813
In all of my dreams.

32:28.913 --> 32:31.416
Listen, kiddo,
you are a natural at it.

32:31.516 --> 32:34.786
So glad you all liked it.
Thank you.

32:34.886 --> 32:38.856
Up next,
Malaysia Babydoll Foxx.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.259
You look beautiful tonight.
I love this look.

32:41.359 --> 32:42.794
I think you did it well.

32:42.894 --> 32:45.163
- All the single ladies, baby.
- Yes.

32:45.263 --> 32:47.332
But, uh, your challenge.

32:47.432 --> 32:50.702
When you walked in the
kitchen, the roles switched.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.136
AKA, are you a size queen?

32:52.236 --> 32:55.006
It became
his interview of you.

32:55.106 --> 32:56.307
Right.

32:56.407 --> 32:57.976
Were you scared of this
challenge?

32:58.076 --> 32:59.477
Not necessarily scared.

32:59.577 --> 33:01.579
I think, like you say,
he has a big personality.

33:01.679 --> 33:03.114
I was kind of taken back.

33:03.214 --> 33:05.750
Look how big your personality
is for what you came out in.

33:05.850 --> 33:07.618
You have to display
that in the challenge.

33:07.719 --> 33:09.787
And you from Dade County, girl?
Uh-huh!

33:09.887 --> 33:12.123
You got to do better, girl.

33:12.223 --> 33:14.325
In my mind, I think
I'm super confident.

33:14.425 --> 33:17.762
And then I shut down
because I get intimidated.

33:17.862 --> 33:19.364
What do you think
is stopping you?

33:19.464 --> 33:22.600
I think sometimes I just
tell myself I'd rather

33:22.700 --> 33:25.269
be safe than, you know, sorry.

33:25.370 --> 33:26.904
Not overdo it, you know?

33:27.005 --> 33:28.506
All right.

33:28.606 --> 33:30.475
Thank you.

33:30.575 --> 33:32.643
Up next, Loosey LaDuca.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.112
Hey.

33:34.212 --> 33:36.981
Somehow you made that drag
tuxedo moment of Beyoncé

33:37.081 --> 33:39.684
revealing her pregnancy
even draggier.

33:39.784 --> 33:42.820
Your challenge--
you have to meet

33:42.920 --> 33:44.022
your guests where they are.

33:44.122 --> 33:45.023
both: You bitch!

33:45.123 --> 33:46.958
[laughter]

33:47.058 --> 33:48.059
And you did that.

33:48.159 --> 33:49.360
Thank you.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.362
He felt comfortable
in your presence, which

33:51.462 --> 33:52.897
is what we often talk about.

33:52.997 --> 33:55.466
And we got some real Frankie.

33:55.566 --> 33:57.468
- Really, really well done.
- Thank you.

33:57.568 --> 33:58.936
Although
I've got to tell you,

33:59.037 --> 34:01.973
he actually accused a
witchdoctor in South Africa

34:02.073 --> 34:04.942
of sticking a spider on--

34:05.043 --> 34:06.878
I wanted you to say,
wait a minute, hold up.

34:06.978 --> 34:09.514
There was a follow up
question, an obvious one.

34:09.614 --> 34:11.949
But we didn't get there.
That's my only mark.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.285
- I wanted that follow up.
- Right.

34:14.385 --> 34:16.754
- Thank you, Loosey.
- Thank you, Ru.

34:16.854 --> 34:17.922
Thank you, ladies.

34:18.022 --> 34:19.323
I think we've heard enough.

34:19.424 --> 34:21.426
While you on untuck
in the Werkroom,

34:21.526 --> 34:23.327
the judges and I
will deliberate.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.365
Welcome back, ladies.

34:27.465 --> 34:29.967
I've made some decisions.

34:31.402 --> 34:34.372
Luxx Noir London, you are safe.

34:34.472 --> 34:36.374
Thank you.

34:37.675 --> 34:41.979
Sasha Colby,
this week you are Queen B.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.848
Condragulations.

34:43.948 --> 34:45.917
You are the winner of
this week's challenge.

34:47.652 --> 34:50.521
You've won a cash prize
of 5,000 gualas.

34:50.621 --> 34:52.156
I won?

34:52.256 --> 34:53.624
Again?

34:53.724 --> 34:55.126
Oh!

34:57.495 --> 35:00.731
Loosey LaDuca, you are safe.

35:06.104 --> 35:09.640
Mistress Isabelle Brooks,
the judges were crazy in love

35:09.740 --> 35:13.778
with your runway, but your
Love Connie interview--

35:13.878 --> 35:15.746
not so much.

35:15.847 --> 35:19.350
Malaysia Babydoll Foxx,
you look gorgeous,

35:19.450 --> 35:23.254
but your interview
was not a dream, girl.

35:23.354 --> 35:28.359
Salina EsTittes, the judges
were warm for your formation,

35:29.560 --> 35:33.364

Now I can finally breathe.
[inhaler puffing]

39:10.881 --> 39:12.516
[laughs] - Oh.

39:14.752 --> 39:16.487
Of course, I wanted to win.

39:16.587 --> 39:18.189
But I am very proud
of what I've done

39:18.289 --> 39:19.557
throughout this competition.

39:19.657 --> 39:22.059

love yourself,

39:36.907 --> 39:38.743

love somebody else?

39:38.843 --> 39:40.277
Can I get an amen up in here?

to a brighter day

39:51.322 --> 39:53.491
Can you feel the love?

39:56.761 --> 39:58.429

40:03.667 --> 40:05.803

You are so funny.

40:14.578 --> 40:16.847
I almost fell out of my skin.

40:16.947 --> 40:19.784
Most of it just
started to fall flat.

40:19.884 --> 40:21.919
It has to be more.

40:22.019 --> 40:25.890
I'm just like,

A little bit of love

40:38.235 --> 40:40.938

40:41.038 --> 40:43.541
Turn it around
