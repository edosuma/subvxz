WEBVTT

00:04.653 --> 00:06.554
Previously,
on "Future Man"...

00:06.620 --> 00:08.856
When we use the TTD,

00:08.922 --> 00:10.992
we jump in time
but not space.

00:11.059 --> 00:13.760
If we jump back, we'd still be
in the same exact place,

00:13.826 --> 00:15.562
just 11 seconds earlier.

00:15.628 --> 00:17.530
Running and jumping,
running and jumping,

00:17.597 --> 00:19.332
running and jumping,
extending our window

00:19.399 --> 00:20.867
- for as much time as we need.
- What's gonna happen

00:20.933 --> 00:22.435
- to all of them?
- Who cares?

00:22.502 --> 00:24.270
- They're not us!
- Down on the ground.

00:24.336 --> 00:27.673
You're under arrest
for violating statute HX-B34

00:27.739 --> 00:29.708
of the Santa Clarita County
Time Code.

01:30.362 --> 01:32.297
Hello, Josh.

01:32.364 --> 01:33.698
I'm Susan.

01:33.765 --> 01:35.799
I know in your time
it's a woman's name.

01:35.866 --> 01:38.336
In ours, it's not.

01:38.402 --> 01:40.471
- It's for both.
- Okay.

01:40.538 --> 01:42.773
Uh, hello, Susan.

01:42.840 --> 01:45.908
Are you my lawyer, or...

01:47.510 --> 01:49.012
Think you'll find
a lot has changed

01:49.079 --> 01:52.282
in the 1,497 years
since you were born.

01:54.050 --> 01:55.284
Whoa.

01:55.351 --> 01:57.253
So it's 3674--

01:57.319 --> 01:58.520
3491.

01:58.587 --> 02:00.289
You should have stayed
in school.

02:00.356 --> 02:04.059
If you had, probably wouldn't
be staring death in the face...

02:04.125 --> 02:06.127
at Ultra-Max.

02:06.194 --> 02:08.163
"Ultra-Max"?

02:08.229 --> 02:11.331
- That sounds pretty bad.
- It is bad.

02:11.398 --> 02:12.399
It's the worst.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.800
Your crimes against humanity

02:13.867 --> 02:15.035
are some of the worst
on records.

02:15.102 --> 02:16.836
I don't even know
where to start.

02:16.903 --> 02:18.938
Biggest to smallest,
smallest to biggest.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.839
Sizes that we don't even
know yet

02:20.906 --> 02:22.875
because they are
unquantifiable.

02:22.941 --> 02:25.444
You have put
the greatest legal minds

02:25.511 --> 02:28.546
of our time in a real pickle,

02:28.613 --> 02:30.882
and I know how much
you like those.

02:30.949 --> 02:33.585
But everything that we did
was for--

02:33.651 --> 02:35.653
"For a good cause"?

02:35.720 --> 02:37.488
Is that what you were
going to say?

02:39.190 --> 02:41.092
Not gonna bother asking you
what this is

02:41.158 --> 02:43.860
because I'm 100% sure
that you don't know.

02:43.927 --> 02:46.097
- The Horsehead Nebula.
- Oh.

02:46.163 --> 02:48.698
I was gonna say
the Crab Nebula.

02:48.764 --> 02:50.433
Your little
time-traveling caper,

02:50.500 --> 02:53.036
repeating the same 11 seconds
over and over and over again?

02:53.103 --> 02:55.504
It ripped a hole
in the space-time continuum

02:55.570 --> 02:56.871
right here.

02:56.938 --> 03:00.109
This was Grazier's Triangle,

03:00.175 --> 03:03.678
which you destroyed along with
the 27 planets that were

03:03.745 --> 03:06.014
inhabited by intelligent life
in its vicinity.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.648
We killed a bunch of ETs?

03:07.715 --> 03:10.818
You killed 85 trillion ETs.

03:10.884 --> 03:13.620
Many of whom looked like ET.

03:13.686 --> 03:16.156
- Whoops.
- We're not alone

03:16.223 --> 03:18.491
- in the universe?
- We weren't.

03:18.558 --> 03:19.960
Now we are again.

03:20.027 --> 03:21.361
There's not even a word
for that kind of murder.

03:21.428 --> 03:23.929
And that's charge one.

03:23.996 --> 03:25.864
Meet your family, Josh.

03:25.931 --> 03:27.599
Every duplicate version of you,

03:27.666 --> 03:29.201
they didn't just
conveniently die

03:29.268 --> 03:32.470
Many of them escaped into time,
where they proceeded

03:32.537 --> 03:33.939
to wreak havoc, setting off

03:34.005 --> 03:36.507
the greatest menhunts
of all times.

03:36.574 --> 03:38.843
What, women weren't hunted
in this fucked-up future?

03:38.909 --> 03:40.978
Oh, they are,
with shocking brutality.

03:41.045 --> 03:42.846
- Thank you.
- Case in point:

03:42.912 --> 03:45.615
William Wolfson,
Third Governor of New York.

03:45.682 --> 03:47.684
Fun fact: he killed John Jay
in a duel.

03:47.751 --> 03:49.818
Jay must have been spoiling
for a fight.

03:49.885 --> 03:52.321
You slept with five
of his six beloved children.

03:52.388 --> 03:55.224
- He slept with children?
- They were adult children.

03:55.291 --> 03:57.293
Well, that sixth child
of John Jay must have been

03:57.360 --> 04:00.462
- a real dog.
- We were on a mission to--

04:00.528 --> 04:01.997
to save the world.

04:02.064 --> 04:04.166
Most of these previous you's
felt the same way,

04:04.232 --> 04:06.234
and they continued
to go back in time

04:06.301 --> 04:09.403
to right previous wrongs,
almost always ending

04:09.470 --> 04:11.438
in the destruction of humanity.

04:12.539 --> 04:17.010
This version of you tried
to stop bin Laden before 9/11.

04:17.077 --> 04:18.678
He ended up giving him
a time machine.

04:18.744 --> 04:20.746
Wh--I would never do that.

04:20.813 --> 04:22.648
You did that, and now
time-traveling bin Laden

04:22.715 --> 04:24.217
is on you.

04:24.284 --> 04:26.318
He's knocking down towers
haven't even been built yet,

04:26.385 --> 04:29.121
so you can imagine that's
a headache for us around here.

04:29.188 --> 04:31.890
And now, let me tell you

04:31.957 --> 04:33.592
about the Topanga Triumverate.

04:33.658 --> 04:37.595
These you's jumped way, way,
way, way, way too far back,

04:37.661 --> 04:40.999
got stuck in the wall
of a cave, died,

04:41.065 --> 04:43.067
was found by archeologists
and disproved

04:43.134 --> 04:44.834
the entire theory of evolution.

04:44.901 --> 04:46.403
Am I boring you?

04:46.469 --> 04:48.171
I'm just noticing
that this glass is reinforced

04:48.238 --> 04:51.141
with carbon-fusion
electro-sealant, so it's just--

04:51.208 --> 04:52.908
it's not how I'm gonna
be escaping.

04:52.975 --> 04:54.810
Oh, you won't be escaping
at all.

04:54.876 --> 04:57.179
- Nothing leaks from Ultra-Max.
- Sure, sure.

04:57.246 --> 04:59.115
Next time you're in this cell
I won't be.

04:59.181 --> 05:00.849
Did any of the us's
do any good?

05:00.916 --> 05:04.319
Yeah, they did good
in their timelines.

05:04.385 --> 05:08.289
But they were also creating
other timelines.

05:08.356 --> 05:10.091
That's what you don't seem
to get.

05:10.157 --> 05:12.993
Every time you went back
to fix something,

05:13.060 --> 05:16.530
you were creating
another timeline.

05:16.596 --> 05:18.632
Wait, what--
what's that, now?

05:18.698 --> 05:20.299
- No.
- Yes.

05:20.366 --> 05:22.768
All these timelines,

05:22.835 --> 05:25.371
all these different realities,

05:25.438 --> 05:26.839
your fault.

05:26.905 --> 05:28.941
And in that reality
the things that we change

05:29.007 --> 05:30.508
change there, but then
when we left

05:30.575 --> 05:31.843
it just stays the same--

05:31.909 --> 05:33.946
- Forever.
- Forever-ever?

05:34.012 --> 05:35.880
Forever-ever-ever.

05:35.948 --> 05:38.249
So Achilles died
in that bunker even though

05:38.315 --> 05:39.450
we took down Stu.

05:39.516 --> 05:41.018
Yes, horribly.

05:41.085 --> 05:43.220
And the Biotics wiped out
the rest of humanity

05:43.287 --> 05:45.189
even though we killed Kronish?

05:45.256 --> 05:47.423
You've never
changed anything.

05:47.490 --> 05:50.060
All the you's running around
thinking they're fixing things,

05:50.126 --> 05:51.894
they're just creating
new things.

05:51.962 --> 05:53.763
You can kill Hitler,
but there will still be

05:53.829 --> 05:56.831
a Hitler,
because there was a Hitler.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.101
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

05:59.168 --> 06:00.069
Yeah.

06:00.135 --> 06:01.903
- So I killed Hitler?
- No.

06:01.971 --> 06:04.772
Shockingly, that is one
of the few things

06:04.838 --> 06:06.941
you never even tried to do.

06:07.008 --> 06:09.810
All Hitlers in your realities
were left unscathed.

06:09.877 --> 06:11.379
Four of them thrived
and won the war.

06:11.445 --> 06:14.914
There's evidence to suggest
you helped Hitler's rise.

06:14.982 --> 06:17.017
So deal with that.

06:17.884 --> 06:19.752
- Yes.
- Who is Hitler, again?

06:19.819 --> 06:23.055
Hitler is just
a convenient shorthand.

06:27.059 --> 06:29.929
This is your case file
coded to your thumbprint.

06:31.329 --> 06:33.131
Here's the bottom line:
The three of you

06:33.198 --> 06:35.633
are responsible
for all the time-crimes

06:35.700 --> 06:37.435
all the other you's committed,

06:37.502 --> 06:41.171
and the punishment
for time-crimes, my friend,

06:41.238 --> 06:42.539
is death.

07:00.622 --> 07:03.425
Look, Susan,
this is bullshit, okay?

07:03.491 --> 07:05.660
There--there is no way
that I am responsible

07:05.727 --> 07:07.094
for what those psychopaths did.

07:07.161 --> 07:09.330
That's not me.
I'm me.

07:09.396 --> 07:10.697
Bullshit?

07:10.764 --> 07:12.433
Try settled law.

07:12.499 --> 07:15.202
Robespierre
versus Robespierre,

07:15.269 --> 07:16.736
2735.

07:16.802 --> 07:19.172
They found in favor
of Robespierre, overturning

07:19.239 --> 07:22.242
the lower court's decision
for Robespierre.

07:22.308 --> 07:24.077
Did you not even read
your cube?

07:24.144 --> 07:25.510
The neural interface
gave me nosebleeds.

07:25.577 --> 07:29.414
Look, still--
still, I cannot be punished

07:29.481 --> 07:31.083
for their crimes.

07:31.150 --> 07:33.085
There might be
another way for you.

07:33.152 --> 07:36.320
You see, some of you

07:36.387 --> 07:37.956
may be...

07:38.022 --> 07:41.525
higher-value targets
than others.

07:42.926 --> 07:46.063
If you're willing
to cooperate...

07:46.129 --> 07:48.431
you might just be able
to speedboat off

07:48.498 --> 07:50.934
Damnation Island
with your life.

07:51.001 --> 07:53.835
And maybe even
a fresh start.

07:59.341 --> 08:01.542
All right, I'll be back
in a bit.

08:01.609 --> 08:04.579
In the meantime, you got
your "smork" on backwards, kid.

08:09.184 --> 08:11.986
Would you be surprised to know

08:12.052 --> 08:14.554
that is who we're really after?

08:14.621 --> 08:16.090
Are you surprised
that I'm still here?

08:16.156 --> 08:17.657
Because I am.

08:17.724 --> 08:20.960
I notice a distinct lack
of oversized laundry carts.

08:21.027 --> 08:22.261
Bravo.

08:22.328 --> 08:24.697
There's a very easy way
out of here.

08:24.763 --> 08:27.333
Through the front door,
onto the red carpet,

08:27.400 --> 08:29.334
onto the speedboat,
to the holo-port

08:29.401 --> 08:32.470
with a very handsome
parting gift.

08:32.537 --> 08:35.673
All you have to do
is tell me all of this

08:35.740 --> 08:37.108
is Futturman's fault.

08:37.174 --> 08:39.310
- Why?
- No one in human history

08:39.376 --> 08:41.045
has caused more suffering
than Josh.

08:41.112 --> 08:44.081
Not Caligula, not Stalin,
not Stu.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.816
Not Xarxon 9,
the Destroyer of Men,

08:46.882 --> 08:49.519
and all he did
was destroy men.

08:49.585 --> 08:52.622
Morning, noon and night,
just destroying them up.

08:52.688 --> 08:54.590
Josh is worse.

08:54.657 --> 08:57.159
I mean, just look at him.

08:58.893 --> 09:00.996
Monsters take many shapes.

09:01.063 --> 09:02.564
As much as I would like
to live--

09:02.631 --> 09:06.234
and believe me, Susan, I...
I'd like to live--

09:06.300 --> 09:07.735
but he's our mistake.

09:07.801 --> 09:09.938
He's also a grown man.

09:12.540 --> 09:13.706
Technically.

09:13.773 --> 09:16.009
Just think about it.
Tell the world the truth

09:16.076 --> 09:18.611
about Josh,
and you get to go free.

09:18.678 --> 09:20.180
Him dying so you can live?

09:20.247 --> 09:22.514
It has a tender mercy to it.

09:22.581 --> 09:26.718
After all, he's responsible
for all of this, and--

09:27.719 --> 09:29.055
And he is beyond redemption.

09:35.060 --> 09:37.795
You are not beyond
redemption, Josh.

09:37.862 --> 09:41.131
And I know the truth.

09:41.198 --> 09:43.968
They're responsible
for all of this.

09:44.969 --> 09:47.504
You know what, Susan, I know
what you're trying to do,

09:47.571 --> 09:50.907
and I am not rolling over
on my friends.

09:50.974 --> 09:52.341
"Friends."

09:52.408 --> 09:54.077
They've done nothing
but use and abuse you.

09:54.143 --> 09:56.479
On a good day
they barely tolerate you.

09:56.545 --> 09:58.981
That--that's just
our dynamic, okay?

09:59.047 --> 10:00.448
- It's fun.
- For them.

10:00.515 --> 10:03.851
They get--and I mean
no disrespect by this--

10:03.919 --> 10:07.188
a hapless, boob, bitch-ass punk
as their whipping boy.

10:07.254 --> 10:08.990
How is that
not disrespectful?

10:09.056 --> 10:11.092
It is, but I qualified it

10:11.158 --> 10:14.228
in an attempt
to protect you, which...

10:14.295 --> 10:16.129
is more than I can say
about them.

10:36.347 --> 10:38.249
- Yeah, okay.
- Pretty--pretty clever.

10:38.316 --> 10:40.451
I see what you're doing.
Classic divide-and-conquer.

10:40.518 --> 10:42.120
Well, I'll tell you something,
okay?

10:42.186 --> 10:44.687
Our bond was forged
in the fires of combat,

10:44.754 --> 10:47.157
which is something that you
and your future race

10:47.224 --> 10:49.893
with your weird suits
and tufts of colorful hair

10:49.960 --> 10:51.361
could never, never understand.

10:51.428 --> 10:53.062
Here's what I understand:

10:53.129 --> 10:54.630
they're the ones
with the time machine.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.999
They came from the future
and they dragged you along,

10:57.066 --> 11:00.868
ripping you from the comfort
of your masturbation chamber.

11:00.936 --> 11:02.703
You shouldn't die for them.

11:02.770 --> 11:04.705
You wanna hear
what they're saying?

11:04.772 --> 11:05.873
Because I do.

11:07.508 --> 11:09.843
We're the ones who put
that savior shit in his head.

11:09.910 --> 11:12.913
Let him tag along even though
I still do not know

11:12.980 --> 11:14.548
what that guy's skill set is.

11:14.614 --> 11:17.351
Yeah, sure, we shoulder
some blame for making him think

11:17.417 --> 11:19.452
he was of any use at any time.

11:19.518 --> 11:20.853
Come on.

11:20.920 --> 11:23.289
I mean, the little guy
has got to take responsibility

11:23.356 --> 11:25.224
for his own actions
at some point.

11:25.291 --> 11:27.060
God, that boy had
some ideas.

11:27.126 --> 11:28.927
Oh, the whole
"Time Warrior" thing?

11:28.994 --> 11:30.328
Are you kidding me?

11:30.395 --> 11:31.897
Act like you've been there
before, right?

11:31.964 --> 11:34.732
If we're guilty of anything
it's for being too nice.

11:34.799 --> 11:36.901
Well, I told you
we should have shot him

11:36.968 --> 11:38.936
after he got us
into that lab.

11:39.003 --> 11:41.172
Ouch.

11:41.238 --> 11:43.540
That hurts.

11:43.607 --> 11:46.009
Could they be talking
about anybody?

12:00.289 --> 12:04.458
Hi, Wolf.

12:04.525 --> 12:06.694
Still mulling over
the big decision?

12:06.760 --> 12:09.497
No idea
which way you're leaning?

12:12.799 --> 12:14.902
Nano-technology.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.536
Also...

12:19.139 --> 12:20.707
Gurkha Black Dragons.

12:20.773 --> 12:24.010
Wrapper's Connecticut
Broad Leaf Maduro.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.178
But you know that.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.080
Yeah, go ahead.

12:28.147 --> 12:29.681
Yeah.

12:29.748 --> 12:31.449
Binder's Cameroonian,

12:31.516 --> 12:33.184
filler's...

12:33.251 --> 12:35.020
Five-year-aged Dominican.

12:35.086 --> 12:36.454
My buddy Sly smoked one
of these

12:36.521 --> 12:37.889
in the movie "F. I. S. T."

12:37.956 --> 12:39.356
F-I-S-T.

12:39.423 --> 12:40.891
- Federation of Inter-State--
- Truckers.

12:40.958 --> 12:42.359
- Right.
- It was a classic film.

12:42.426 --> 12:44.094
- Great.
- Anyway, they cut the scene

12:44.161 --> 12:45.562
because they felt
it was gratuitous.

12:45.629 --> 12:47.597
Went on too long,
sapping energy

12:47.664 --> 12:50.866
from the plot when, uh,
they should have been...

12:53.169 --> 12:56.039
Building the...

12:56.105 --> 12:58.040
uh, tension.

12:58.106 --> 12:59.741
Sounds like a good cut.

13:04.246 --> 13:08.015
Okay, your parlor tricks
and your bribes are not gonna--

13:08.082 --> 13:11.152
oh, that is
Sweet Mama Jessup.

13:11.218 --> 13:12.887
Sweet Mama J.

13:12.954 --> 13:15.321
It's not all I have, Tiger.

13:20.426 --> 13:23.429
Inside this envelope
is the story of a girl.

13:23.496 --> 13:25.730
A girl born to Biotic parents,

13:25.797 --> 13:28.934
stolen from them
at an impossibly young age.

13:30.135 --> 13:31.236
Sorry, this is a Phonola.

13:31.303 --> 13:33.471
I am used to a Philco.

13:33.537 --> 13:35.606
I didn't hear anything
you said.

13:36.440 --> 13:39.743
5,500 square feet,
raw restaurant space.

13:39.810 --> 13:42.013
Collins Avenue, Miami,

13:42.080 --> 13:44.181
1987.

13:44.247 --> 13:45.348
And to make sure
you get started

13:45.415 --> 13:48.118
on the right foot:

13:48.185 --> 13:49.719
This.

13:49.786 --> 13:52.121
And this is not that weak shit
you were butt-darting

13:52.188 --> 13:53.289
in Los Angeles.

13:53.355 --> 13:54.891
This is that good shit.

13:54.957 --> 13:57.759
That Colombian shit
that doesn't leave South Beach.

13:57.826 --> 14:00.795
And I got one more thing
I think you might

14:00.861 --> 14:01.963
be interested in.

14:05.100 --> 14:06.601
- This handsome fellow.
- Oh...

14:06.667 --> 14:09.170
Pulled off a dead Josh
from the Epsilon line.

14:09.236 --> 14:10.670
Fully functional.

14:10.737 --> 14:14.474
Just begging to be reattached.

14:14.541 --> 14:16.476
In our time,
penile enhancements

14:16.543 --> 14:18.878
take eight minutes
and are quite pleasurable.

14:18.945 --> 14:22.048
Trust me, I've had three.

14:22.115 --> 14:23.449
Go ahead.

14:29.187 --> 14:30.555
Girthier than you remember,
right?

14:30.622 --> 14:32.124
Oh, it feels just right.

14:32.190 --> 14:33.591
Weighs 19 1/2 pounds.

14:33.658 --> 14:35.460
I know.

14:35.527 --> 14:37.394
Oh, hello, old friend.

14:37.461 --> 14:39.363
You two look
very beautiful together.

14:39.430 --> 14:41.332
No, no, no, I can't.

14:41.398 --> 14:43.100
I can't.
Every time I whipped it out

14:43.167 --> 14:46.269
I'd be whipping out the memory
of a friend I betrayed.

14:46.336 --> 14:47.703
All right.

14:47.770 --> 14:50.806
I'll leave you two
to think about it.

15:35.413 --> 15:37.582
Look, Susan...

15:37.648 --> 15:39.816
I've, uh, given your offer
some thought--

15:39.884 --> 15:41.218
Too late.

15:41.285 --> 15:43.687
Offer's off the table.

15:43.753 --> 15:44.889
Okay.

15:44.955 --> 15:46.556
Well, that's fine,
because I was actually

15:46.623 --> 15:48.157
gonna say that there was
no way you can get me

15:48.224 --> 15:49.592
to turn on my friends.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.327
Yep.

15:51.394 --> 15:52.661
I suspected that might be
the case.

15:52.728 --> 15:55.698
Your loyalty is impressive,
Josh...

15:55.764 --> 15:57.032
Thank you.

15:57.099 --> 15:59.467
But it's about to be put
to the ultimate test.

16:01.203 --> 16:02.737
What?

16:02.804 --> 16:03.805
By--by who?

16:03.872 --> 16:05.173
What--what are you
talking about?

16:05.240 --> 16:06.607
Is there a judge?
Is there a jury?

16:06.673 --> 16:08.475
Like, what the--what the fuck
is going on?

16:08.542 --> 16:10.044
Josh, your barbaric
legal system,

16:10.111 --> 16:12.746
it's been replaced
by something far more elegant.

16:12.813 --> 16:15.081
This is skin-eating poison.
"Death Rain."

16:15.148 --> 16:18.084
One spray kills on contact
and you, Josh,

16:18.151 --> 16:20.686
are going to use it on Tiger

16:20.753 --> 16:23.789
or Wolf.

16:23.857 --> 16:25.224
Uh, no I'm not.

16:25.290 --> 16:27.592
- No way.
- No.

16:27.659 --> 16:29.361
Well, that's the best offer
we have to give you.

16:29.428 --> 16:31.096
Otherwise, all three
of you die.

16:31.163 --> 16:32.664
And that's more elegant?

16:32.731 --> 16:34.532
- Elegant just means "simple."
- It doesn't mean "fancy."

16:34.598 --> 16:35.699
People think it means "fancy"--
it doesn't.

16:35.766 --> 16:37.168
It just means "simple."

16:37.235 --> 16:38.870
Still wouldn't
call that elegant,

16:38.937 --> 16:42.405
but I guess there is some kind
of cruel justice to it.

16:42.472 --> 16:45.075
- No, no. It's not cruel, Josh.
- It's a gift.

16:45.142 --> 16:47.744
All three of you are facing
the death penalty.

16:47.810 --> 16:51.247
But this way,
two of you get to live.

16:51.313 --> 16:53.749
This all seems very random.

16:53.815 --> 16:56.052
Tonight, you will have
your final meal together.

16:56.118 --> 16:59.188
When the last course arrives--
a traditional dessert salad--

16:59.255 --> 17:01.322
the dressing will be in these.

17:01.389 --> 17:02.958
Yours will have Death Rain.

17:03.024 --> 17:04.725
One minute after
the course arrives

17:04.792 --> 17:06.594
the lights will go out,
giving you the opportunity

17:06.661 --> 17:10.397
to anonymously kill one
of your dear, dear friends.

17:10.464 --> 17:11.798
That's future justice?

17:11.866 --> 17:13.433
Choose which friend to kill?

17:13.500 --> 17:15.802
That's one way
of looking at it.

17:15.870 --> 17:17.571
Another...

17:17.637 --> 17:19.305
you choose which friend
to save.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.907
I know it's a tough choice.

17:20.974 --> 17:23.042
Just know that if they were
given this same offer--

17:23.109 --> 17:25.644
which they definitely
were not--but if they were,

17:25.711 --> 17:28.246
they would kill you
without hesitation.

17:28.313 --> 17:29.747
So there it is.

17:29.814 --> 17:33.285
All three of you die,
or you save yourself...

17:33.351 --> 17:35.153
and one of them.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.388
That's the best deal
you're gonna get...

17:38.923 --> 17:40.591
from Ultra-Max.

17:43.727 --> 17:45.795
I know you're the leader
of the group,

17:45.862 --> 17:48.764
bound by honor and integrity.

17:48.831 --> 17:51.101
The Tigers across all
the timelines have been

17:51.167 --> 17:52.402
a force of good.

17:52.468 --> 17:53.903
Many have even helped us.

17:53.969 --> 17:56.505
Well, those other me's,
they're using you.

17:56.571 --> 17:58.707
You just don't know it yet.

17:58.773 --> 18:02.444
Think of Josh.

18:02.511 --> 18:05.079
Sick with delusions
of grandeur.

18:05.146 --> 18:07.415
Or maybe you pity him.

18:07.481 --> 18:08.917
Fine.
Kill Wolf.

18:08.983 --> 18:11.052
He's a prisoner
of his own appetites.

18:11.119 --> 18:13.386
Sashaying selfishly
through life

18:13.453 --> 18:15.688
with wanton disregard
for anyone

18:15.755 --> 18:17.324
or anything
that doesn't please him.

18:17.390 --> 18:19.592
Has he ever
not abandoned you?

18:19.659 --> 18:22.461
From where I'm standing,
the hardest choice:

18:22.528 --> 18:24.396
Deciding who not to kill.

18:27.766 --> 18:30.835
And that's why only you
can carry this out.

18:30.902 --> 18:34.605
Trained soldier, a survivor
who sashays effortlessly

18:34.672 --> 18:36.374
through life no matter
what it throws at him.

18:36.441 --> 18:38.708
You're no mission commander.
You're not the Chosen One.

18:38.775 --> 18:42.379
You follow orders,
and you make lemonade.

18:42.446 --> 18:43.713
You don't deserve
to die for that.

18:43.780 --> 18:45.782
I am still in my prime.

18:45.850 --> 18:48.151
You're the only one
I'm making this offer to, Wolf,

18:48.217 --> 18:50.619
because you're the only one

18:50.686 --> 18:52.721
I truly believe is innocent.

18:52.788 --> 18:55.191
Thank you, Susan.

18:55.258 --> 18:56.859
Call me Sue.

18:56.925 --> 18:59.427
Sue.

18:59.494 --> 19:03.866
♪♪ Oh, what a day ♪♪

19:06.167 --> 19:08.069
- Mm.
- Mm.

19:08.135 --> 19:11.405
Gotta tell you guys,
I sure am gonna miss

19:11.472 --> 19:13.007
Texas barbecue.

19:13.074 --> 19:16.109
This abalone tastes like
it was caught tomorrow.

19:17.743 --> 19:21.447
Mine's, uh--mine's cat.

19:21.514 --> 19:23.216
Pass the salt.

19:25.384 --> 19:27.552
Thank you, Tiger.

19:27.619 --> 19:30.622
I like a little extra seasoning
on my food.

19:30.689 --> 19:33.224
You probably didn't know that
because we don't

19:33.291 --> 19:34.692
know each other that well.

19:34.758 --> 19:36.094
Unlike me and Tiger.

19:36.160 --> 19:39.063
We've known each other
our whole lives.

19:39.130 --> 19:40.698
Thick and thin.

19:42.165 --> 19:45.903
Yeah, I don't really
know you that well,

19:45.969 --> 19:50.007
which, to me, makes it
even weirder that you're always

19:50.073 --> 19:51.773
such a dick to me.

19:51.841 --> 19:54.944
What I can't figure out is...

19:55.011 --> 19:56.478
which one of you is meaner.

19:56.545 --> 19:58.214
Oh, well, that's--
that's easy.

19:58.280 --> 20:01.682
I mean, Wolf says mean things,
but I have an anger toward you

20:01.749 --> 20:03.418
that is almost primal.

20:03.484 --> 20:05.053
True.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.889
However, when I was
about to die

20:07.956 --> 20:10.690
in James Cameron's lab,
you did go

20:10.757 --> 20:12.792
rathole-to-rathole for me.

20:12.860 --> 20:16.296
Okay, well, there goes
my appetite, so anybody want

20:16.363 --> 20:17.864
my kitty cubes?

20:17.931 --> 20:19.165
Tiger, do you remember
the time--

20:19.232 --> 20:21.000
you weren't there--
we jumped out

20:21.067 --> 20:23.236
of Count Bowncelizar's
Trampolarium

20:23.302 --> 20:26.372
and, uh, did not think
that net was gonna hold?

20:26.439 --> 20:27.439
Do you remember that?

20:27.505 --> 20:29.241
But it did.
It did.

20:29.307 --> 20:30.575
It held.

20:30.642 --> 20:32.010
Just like our bond.

20:34.312 --> 20:36.213
But then again, Wolf,

20:36.280 --> 20:38.715
you did save me
from the Smash Pit,

20:38.782 --> 20:41.718
and, uh, from being
burned alive.

20:41.785 --> 20:44.654
Um, yeah, the again from, uh--

20:44.720 --> 20:46.923
from Stu's kill-mandos, so...

20:46.990 --> 20:48.992
Wow.

20:49.059 --> 20:52.695
That's way more
than you've done for me lately.

20:52.762 --> 20:54.930
Well, luckily for us
"lately" is just a blip

20:54.997 --> 20:56.798
in a life-long blood bond.

20:56.866 --> 20:58.767
- Mm.
- Sometimes, though,

20:58.834 --> 21:02.004
it's the, uh--the people
closest to you

21:02.071 --> 21:04.638
that disappoint you the most.

21:14.614 --> 21:16.216
A toast.

21:16.283 --> 21:18.218
Yes.

21:18.285 --> 21:19.519
To life.

21:19.586 --> 21:22.288
And death, which is inevitable,

21:22.354 --> 21:25.724
and sometimes comes
sooner than expected.

21:25.791 --> 21:27.994
And sometimes
it comes randomly,

21:28.060 --> 21:30.195
like someone flipped a coin

21:30.261 --> 21:32.931
because they couldn't--
couldn't decide.

21:32.998 --> 21:35.867
But when it does come,
sometimes it's--

21:35.934 --> 21:38.836
well, it's for the best.

21:38.903 --> 21:42.506
To our inevitable fate...

21:42.572 --> 21:44.108
however--
Whenever.

21:44.174 --> 21:46.610
- By the hand of whomever.
- It may come.

21:46.676 --> 21:48.577
Uh-huh.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.235
Yum.

22:15.301 --> 22:17.871
Salad dessert.

22:17.938 --> 22:20.340
It's dessert salad.

22:20.406 --> 22:22.808
You know, I always thought
this is how it would end.

22:22.876 --> 22:26.145
Time jail, cube salad,
