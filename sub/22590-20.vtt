00:09.511 --> 00:12.263
<i>NARRATOR".
A peaceful day in Gotham City.</i>

00:12.430 --> 00:14.682
<i>But at the Gotham City branch of the Mint...</i>

00:14.849 --> 00:19.479
<i>...the peace is about to be shattered
by a familiar feathered felon.</i>

00:20.355 --> 00:23.525
-Hey--
-Get going. Hwah, hwah, hwah.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.862
Come on, follow me.

00:32.616 --> 00:34.953
- Hands up.
-Penguin, what do you want here?

00:35.119 --> 00:38.456
I'm here to get a gift for my lady love.
What do you want, my dear?

00:38.623 --> 00:39.832
Well, I don't know, Pengy.

00:39.999 --> 00:42.126
Um, ha, ha. What do they have?

00:42.293 --> 00:45.255
Ha, ha. Well, there's a very fine ink.
Would you like that?

00:45.421 --> 00:47.632
- Just plain ink?
-Green ink.

00:47.799 --> 00:51.970
Green ink, my love.
And here's some fine paper. You get the idea?

00:52.136 --> 00:56.933
- Oh, Pengy, I'm beginning to catch on.
-Of course, you are.

00:57.100 --> 01:02.480
You see, green ink and paper
make a very interesting combination.

01:02.689 --> 01:04.022
Perfect.

01:04.190 --> 01:07.569
There's your money.
Wheelbarrows full of money.

01:09.279 --> 01:11.823
And when Barbara told me
she'd been elected chairman...

01:11.990 --> 01:14.492
...of the Gotham City
anti-littering campaign...

01:14.659 --> 01:18.329
- Daddy arranged for this meeting, Bruce.
-I'm glad he did, Barbara.

01:18.496 --> 01:20.748
Never hurts to remind anyone
of the litter basket.

01:20.915 --> 01:23.334
Gosh, yes. A clean city is a healthy city.

01:23.501 --> 01:25.837
- Then we can count on your support.
-Of course.

01:26.004 --> 01:28.006
A call for Commissioner Gordon, sir.

01:28.172 --> 01:30.383
- Take it there.
-Oh, thank you, Alfred.

01:31.009 --> 01:32.969
Commissioner Gordon.

01:35.471 --> 01:37.682
Terrible news, Chief O'Hara.

01:37.849 --> 01:40.518
Use the red phone
and call Batman immediately.

01:40.685 --> 01:42.437
I'll hold on to this line.

01:42.604 --> 01:46.107
- Anything serious, commissioner?
-Penguin's just been reported in the Mint.

01:46.524 --> 01:48.735
- Penguin in the Mint? That is serious.
- Yeah.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.696
Oh, sir, this is perhaps
an inopportune moment...

01:51.863 --> 01:55.533
...but the downstairs hot water line
has burst once again...

01:55.700 --> 01:58.286
...and the shut-off valve
seems to be rusted up.

01:58.453 --> 02:00.872
I'll give you a hand, Alfred.
Would you excuse me?

02:01.039 --> 02:02.749
Yeah, surely, surely.

02:05.668 --> 02:08.086
Maybe I didn't work it right.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.922
Yes, chief-- Commissioner.

02:10.089 --> 02:11.924
It's Chief O'Hara, Batman.

02:12.091 --> 02:15.553
- Oh, oh.
-The commissioner is visiting Bruce Wayne.

02:15.720 --> 02:19.349
He wanted me to call you
and tell you that The Penguin is back...

02:19.515 --> 02:22.560
...and he's broken into the Mint.
-Is he still in the Mint, chief?

02:22.727 --> 02:25.605
No, drat the luck.
He's already made his escape.

02:25.772 --> 02:27.065
We'll be right down, chief.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.074

03:51.983 --> 03:53.651
The dynamic do-gooders.

03:53.818 --> 03:57.196
You've been helping old ladies
across the street, Batman? Hwah, hwah.

03:57.613 --> 04:00.992
We're going to help you
into a jail cell, you beaked buffoon.

04:01.159 --> 04:04.245
Leave my beak out of this,
you baby barnacle.

04:04.662 --> 04:08.374
- Let's get them, Batman.
-No, no! Stop this loutish violence...

04:08.541 --> 04:09.917
...you teenage truant.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.712
It offends my cultured soul.

04:14.213 --> 04:17.341
Hwah, hwah, hwah.

04:20.553 --> 04:22.346
Hwah, hwah, hwah.

04:23.681 --> 04:25.266
Come on.

04:25.433 --> 04:28.227
There's the blue-coated baboon...

04:28.603 --> 04:30.396
...and his boorish boss.

04:30.563 --> 04:35.943
Perfect witnesses, Pengy,
when you bring suit for false arrest.

04:36.110 --> 04:37.445
False arrest?

04:37.612 --> 04:39.530
I'm afraid it's true, Boy Wonder.

04:39.697 --> 04:42.617
You mean, The Penguin
has committed no crime, Chief O'Hara?

04:42.784 --> 04:44.702
He didn't steal a thing from the Mint.

04:44.869 --> 04:47.747
Not one red cent, Batman.
I just talked to the supervisor.

04:47.914 --> 04:49.540
I didn't steal a thing.

04:49.707 --> 04:52.376
And what do you say
to a million-dollar lawsuit, eh?

04:52.877 --> 04:56.631
What do you say to the fact that you're
still guilty of breaking and entering...

04:56.798 --> 04:59.717
...and therefore your arrest was not false?
-What?

04:59.884 --> 05:01.677
By golly, you're right, Batman.

05:01.844 --> 05:04.430
The slimy bird outsmarted himself.

05:04.597 --> 05:08.267
This is trickery.
This is low, conniving trickery.

05:08.434 --> 05:10.520
The only trickery was on your part, Penguin.

05:10.686 --> 05:14.607
So for the present, you drop the lawsuit,
we'll drop the charges.

05:14.774 --> 05:17.610
Now, Commissioner Gordon,
would you like us to show...

05:18.027 --> 05:20.488
...these uninvited guests out of your office?

05:20.655 --> 05:22.240
Very definitely, Batman.

05:22.615 --> 05:27.286
- Hwah. We're going. That's right, we're going.
-Or maybe you'd like a helping hand, huh?

05:29.497 --> 05:32.333
You sure outwitted
that waddling weasel, Batman.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.001
But why did you let him go?

05:34.168 --> 05:37.296
We couldn't have held him long
on those minor charges, commissioner.

05:37.463 --> 05:40.466
He must've gone daft,
breaking into the Mint for no reason.

05:40.633 --> 05:44.262
- I'm sure he had a reason, Chief O'Hara.
-But if he didn't take anything out of the Mint...

05:46.013 --> 05:48.766
- Maybe he put something in.
-Batgirl.

05:48.933 --> 05:50.643
How did you know about this, Batgirl?

05:50.810 --> 05:53.354
I just happened to be driving
by the Mint, Batman...

05:53.521 --> 05:55.106
...and saw the police cars. Why?

05:55.273 --> 05:58.317
Oh, just curious.
But your hunch is a shrewd one, Batgirl.

05:58.484 --> 06:01.612
I might also add,
the police found all the Mint employees...

06:01.779 --> 06:03.447
- ...fast asleep.
- Asleep?

06:03.614 --> 06:05.700
Penguin always uses gas, Batman.

06:05.867 --> 06:09.287
But Penguin gas wears off quickly, Robin.

06:09.453 --> 06:13.416
I suggest we take a tour of that Mint.
We'll be in touch, commissioner.

06:20.673 --> 06:22.300
Great Scott.

06:22.466 --> 06:24.176
Take a look, Robin.

06:25.595 --> 06:28.389
Looks like a bunch of miniature
tadpoles, Batman.

06:28.556 --> 06:30.057
Batgirl?

06:32.184 --> 06:33.436
Bacteria.

06:33.603 --> 06:35.688
They seemed to be
of the species somnophilia.

06:35.855 --> 06:39.358
<i>Somnophilia lygeria to be</i> exact, <i>Batgirl.</i>

06:39.525 --> 06:41.360
Lygerian Sleeping Sickness.

06:41.527 --> 06:44.822
They're normally carried
by the Lygerian fruit fly.

06:44.989 --> 06:48.492
In this case, Penguin was able
to plant a culture of the bacteria...

06:48.659 --> 06:51.162
...in the ink used in making this money.

06:51.329 --> 06:55.041
Officer, have any bills been shipped out of here
since Penguin made his raid?

06:55.207 --> 06:56.626
I'm afraid so, Batman.

06:56.792 --> 06:59.503
Gotham National Bank picked up a load
not half an hour ago.

06:59.837 --> 07:02.965
There's no time to lose.
Batgirl, you go to the bank.

07:03.132 --> 07:06.928
Robin and I will go to Gotham General Hospital
and meet you later at the bank.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.179
The hospital?

07:08.346 --> 07:13.267
Yes, it's the only place in the country
that carries a supply of B-6 vaccine.

07:13.434 --> 07:18.689
And B-6 vaccine is the only known antidote
for Lygerian Sleeping Sickness.

07:18.856 --> 07:22.526
Holy hypodermics.
We'd better get our hands on it fast.

07:24.779 --> 07:26.781
<i>NARRATOR".
But at the Gotham General Hospital...</i>

07:26.948 --> 07:31.035
...a <i>certain well-known bird
is up to his usual well-known tricks.</i>

07:31.744 --> 07:33.579
Hurry up with that hypo.

07:33.746 --> 07:35.539
And give him a double dose too.

07:35.706 --> 07:37.541
Gee, boss, do I have to?

07:37.708 --> 07:40.670
Unless you wanna sleep
the rest of your life, dolt.

07:40.836 --> 07:43.673
There is no fun in that, is there, Dustbag?

07:43.839 --> 07:45.216
All right, jab him.

07:45.383 --> 07:46.759
Go ahead...

07:46.926 --> 07:49.303
...before I do some jabbing myself.

07:51.722 --> 07:56.394
Very good. Now we're all inoculated.
Where's the rest of the vaccine?

07:57.478 --> 07:59.730
Come on, hand it over...

07:59.897 --> 08:05.236
...before I demonstrate the famous
Penguin technique of open-heart surgery.

08:10.074 --> 08:12.284
Very good. Is this all of it?

08:13.119 --> 08:16.831
Huh? You don't talk much, do you?

08:18.249 --> 08:22.294
He's a mute doctor. Here we are. Ah.

08:22.795 --> 08:24.922
Now we're the only people in Gotham City...

08:25.089 --> 08:29.135
...protected against the Lygerian
Sleeping Sickness. Hwah, hwah, hwah.

08:30.636 --> 08:33.847
You're not protected against
a good right jab, you slimy bird.

08:34.015 --> 08:35.933
It's beddy-bye for you, Penguin.

08:36.100 --> 08:39.979
Nobody catches The Penguin sleeping,
dynamic dreamers.

08:41.272 --> 08:43.274
Try this on for size.

08:47.987 --> 08:51.782
The lethal Lygerian fruit fly.

08:52.116 --> 08:54.952
Pleasant dreams, Batfink.

08:58.706 --> 09:02.501
Look out, Robin. They are deadly.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.758
Missed. They're too fast, Batman.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.801
What about the Insecticide Bat-bomb?

09:10.968 --> 09:12.511
I left it in the Batmobile.

09:12.678 --> 09:16.932
But we dare not open that door
until all three of these flies are dead.

09:17.099 --> 09:19.685
Fortunately I brought
my All-Purpose Bat-Swatter.

09:29.320 --> 09:32.490
- You got one, Batman.
-TouchÃ©.

09:35.076 --> 09:36.994
You got another one.

09:37.328 --> 09:39.955
That means there's one left, Robin.

09:48.547 --> 09:49.590
Batman.

09:52.885 --> 09:53.928
Don't breathe, Robin.

09:55.596 --> 09:59.725
Hold perfectly still.
This calls for the Bat-tweezers.

10:06.398 --> 10:10.027
One bite from this fruit fly, Robin...

10:10.194 --> 10:12.404
...and you might have been asleep for years.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.532
Holy Rip van Winkle.

10:14.698 --> 10:19.203
But this specimen might prove
quite rewarding research-wise.

10:20.412 --> 10:21.539
Hold that, Robin.

10:24.959 --> 10:26.043
In the bottle.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.712
Gingerly, gingerly.

10:31.882 --> 10:37.263
Ah. Doctor, has Penguin disposed
of all that B-6 vaccine?

10:37.429 --> 10:39.974
I'm afraid so, and the only other
supply is in Lygeria.

10:40.141 --> 10:43.936
Telephone Lygeria. Have them fly
fruit fly vaccine here immediately.

10:44.103 --> 10:46.897
All right, Batman,
but "immediately" means 24 hours.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.274
Twenty-four hours of hope.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.318
Hope that Penguin has no more
of those fruit flies on hand.

10:51.485 --> 10:55.656
And that Batgirl reached Gotham National
to prevent circulation of the infected money.

10:55.823 --> 10:59.410
Yes, that money can be as dangerous
as those fruit flies. To the bank, Robin.

11:01.412 --> 11:03.080
Well, we're out or luck, Batgirl.

11:03.247 --> 11:06.167
Thirteen thousand dollars
has already been distributed.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.336
- To whom?
-To whomever came in today.

11:09.503 --> 11:13.257
Then that infected money could be
anywhere in Gotham City right now.

11:14.925 --> 11:18.596
We missed, Batman,
13,000 infected dollars have already gone out.

11:18.762 --> 11:21.098
- What about the vaccine?
-Penguin beat us to it.

11:21.265 --> 11:24.435
And it'll take at least 24 hours
before we can get any more.

11:24.602 --> 11:28.606
That means everyone in Gotham City will be
vulnerable to Lygerian Sleeping Sickness...

11:28.772 --> 11:30.816
...because of those contaminated bills.

11:30.983 --> 11:32.818
Yes, there's only one thing to do.

11:32.985 --> 11:35.070
May I use your telephone?

11:42.912 --> 11:44.121
Commissioner.

11:44.288 --> 11:48.918
I want you to notify all radio and TV stations
to broadcast the following message:

11:49.084 --> 11:53.422
"Some of the money now circulating
in Gotham City carries a deadly disease.

11:53.589 --> 11:55.716
No one is to handle any of this money.

11:55.883 --> 12:00.304
Repeat. No one is to come in contact
with any of this money."

12:00.471 --> 12:02.973
Isn't that rather drastic, Batman?

12:03.140 --> 12:04.767
There's no other way, commissioner.

12:04.934 --> 12:08.062
We don't know what money is infected
and what money is not.

12:08.229 --> 12:10.856
We must prevent contact with any of it.

12:11.023 --> 12:13.317
Of course, Batman. I'll see to it right away.

12:13.484 --> 12:14.860
Thank you.

12:16.487 --> 12:19.073
Batgirl, Robin and I will meet you
in a couple of hours.

12:19.240 --> 12:22.034
- We have some things to attend to.
<i>- I'll</i> be here.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.630
<i>We interrupt our music
to bring you</i> a <i>special bulletin.</i>

12:34.797 --> 12:38.968
<i>Some of the money in Gotham City has been
infected with a deadly tropical disease.</i>

12:39.134 --> 12:44.932
<i>Any contact with money now circulating
in Gotham City may be extremely dangerous.</i>

13:06.328 --> 13:08.497
- How did it go?
-Like taking candy from a baby.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.374
I never thought it'd be so easy.

13:10.541 --> 13:13.335
<i>We interrupt this program
to bring you</i> a <i>special bulletin.</i>

13:13.502 --> 13:17.715
<i>Some of the money in Gotham City has been

13:17.881 --> 13:23.595
<i>Any contact with money now circulating
in Gotham City may be extremely dangerous.</i>

13:36.692 --> 13:39.403
I just love sweeping up.

13:39.570 --> 13:42.906
I never thought I'd like
being a trash collector, boss.

13:43.073 --> 13:46.368
It's different when there's gold
in the garbage, huh? Hwah.

13:49.997 --> 13:54.460
There's trash of another color
on the horizon. Bat trash.

13:54.626 --> 13:58.922
Consider your collecting career
over, Penguin.

14:06.055 --> 14:08.349
Shall we finish her off, boss?

14:08.515 --> 14:11.769
No, no, no,
business before pleasure, Dustbag.

14:11.935 --> 14:17.024
With all this moola lying around,
there's no time to bother with Batgirl.

14:17.191 --> 14:19.777
Onward and upward.

14:21.945 --> 14:26.992
<i>Sweep, brother, sweep with care
There's a bunch of moola everywhere</i>

14:27.159 --> 14:31.872
<i>Sweep, brother, sweep with care
There's money, money everywhere</i>

14:32.039 --> 14:34.333
<i>Sweep, brother, sweep</i>

14:34.500 --> 14:36.960
<i>Sweep, brother, sweep</i>

14:40.547 --> 14:44.134
Hello, Ibn Mukdash? This is Bruce Wayne.

14:44.301 --> 14:46.720
No, no, it's not about my oil interests.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.681
I called to tell you that the currency
here in Gotham City...

14:49.848 --> 14:52.559
...is infected with a dangerous disease.

14:52.726 --> 14:56.522
I wanna warn you against accepting any of it
for the next few days.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.190
You're quite welcome.

14:58.357 --> 15:03.487
You might pass the information on to
the other financiers in your area of the world.

15:03.987 --> 15:05.572
Yes, goodbye, Ibn.

15:06.907 --> 15:08.492
Is that, uh...?

15:08.909 --> 15:10.953
- Carpathia.
-Thank you.

15:12.079 --> 15:15.999
Hello? Hello, Mr. Bolescu.

15:17.501 --> 15:21.672
<i>NARRATOR". And in a warehouse
near the outskirts of the city...</i>

15:24.007 --> 15:25.467
There's millions!

15:25.634 --> 15:29.596
And plenty more in the streets
ready for us to pick up.

15:29.763 --> 15:33.434
Oh, Pengy, are you going
to buy me something?

15:33.600 --> 15:39.189
Yes, anything your evil little heart desires,
you just name it. Hmm?

15:39.898 --> 15:42.693
I've always wanted a little house
in the country.

15:42.860 --> 15:46.405
One house in the country coming up.

15:46.572 --> 15:48.615
Where's that phone? Ah, here it is.

15:48.782 --> 15:52.995
Hello, operator, would you give me the
headquarters of the World League of Nations?

15:53.162 --> 15:55.122
Why are you calling them for, Pengy?'

15:55.289 --> 15:59.626
You said you wanted a house in the country,
I gotta buy you a country to put the house in.

16:01.879 --> 16:04.214
Hello, World League of Nations?

16:04.381 --> 16:07.885
I'd like to buy a country.
What have you got?

16:08.427 --> 16:12.055
No. I don't want that one.
I'm allergic to vodka. Heh.

16:12.222 --> 16:15.893
Something a little smaller, you know,
with a few mountains, a little seacoast.

16:16.059 --> 16:18.020
Yeah, that'll be fine.

16:18.187 --> 16:20.898
I'll take it. I'll pay cash.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.068
The name is Penguin.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.905
Address: Gotham City.

16:29.114 --> 16:30.157
What do you mean?

16:30.324 --> 16:32.576
What do you mean
you can't accept my money?

16:32.910 --> 16:34.411
It's perfectly good money.

16:34.578 --> 16:36.497
I don't care what Bruce Wayne said.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.166
What? Wait a minute.

16:39.333 --> 16:43.587
Hello? Hello! Hwah, hwah, hwah!

16:43.754 --> 16:46.256
Penguin, why don't you try
somewhere else?

16:46.423 --> 16:50.302
After all, Bruce Wayne can't have notified
everyone in the world.

16:50.469 --> 16:54.932
All right, how would you like some diamonds,
a couple of hundred pounds of them, huh?

16:55.098 --> 16:56.558
You like that, my dear?

16:56.725 --> 16:58.435
You're a doll.

17:00.395 --> 17:04.273
It's perfectly good money.
You can't do this to me!

17:04.441 --> 17:05.651
Hwah, hwah.

17:05.943 --> 17:10.446
Here we are, knee-deep in money,
and we can't even buy a stick of gum.

17:10.614 --> 17:12.156
That millionaire fink...

17:12.324 --> 17:16.036
...Bruce Wayne has warned everybody
in the world about me.

17:16.203 --> 17:20.499
Well, he'll learn that nobody crosses
The Penguin and gets away with it.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.376
Hwah, hwah, hwah.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.296
Thanks to your calls, Batman...

17:26.463 --> 17:31.134
...there's probably no one in the world who
will accept Penguin's money. A brilliant idea.

17:31.301 --> 17:34.888
Merely common sense, old churn.

17:35.055 --> 17:38.642
If you can't spend it, money is
just a lot of worthless paper, isn't it?

17:38.809 --> 17:42.813
And that's exactly what Penguin has,
a pile of worthless green paper.

17:42.980 --> 17:46.900
Our main worry right now
lies elsewhere, Robin.

17:47.734 --> 17:52.573
Lygerian fruit flies
such as the one under this microscope...

17:52.739 --> 17:57.119
...pose a frightening and lethal threat.

17:57.327 --> 18:00.122
If Penguin has any more of them,
and he probably does...

18:00.289 --> 18:04.835
...he's may be fiend enough to loose them all
on Gotham City in a fit of rage...

18:05.002 --> 18:07.879
...when he finds he can't spend that money
that he's swept up.

18:08.046 --> 18:11.800
- The weather forecast, Alfred?
-I make it clear and cool, sir.

18:11.967 --> 18:15.095
Temperature approximately, uh, 45 degrees.

18:15.262 --> 18:18.807
- Are you sure, Alfred?
-Sure as any weatherman can be, sir.

18:20.726 --> 18:24.396
That's probably our feathered friend.

18:25.188 --> 18:26.231
Bruce Wayne.

18:26.398 --> 18:30.402
I know all about your calls
to world financiers, you fink.

18:30.569 --> 18:31.695
Now you listen to this.

18:31.862 --> 18:36.033
Unless you call every one of them back
and tell them to accept my money...

18:36.199 --> 18:42.706
...I will let 500 Lygerian fruit flies
loose on Gotham City.

18:42.873 --> 18:45.042
I refuse your ultimatum, Penguin.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.753
And I will not reverse any of those calls.

18:47.919 --> 18:51.465
All right, Wayne.
You have just doomed Gotham City...

18:51.632 --> 18:56.970
...to 1000 years of very sound sleep.
Hwah, hwah, hwah.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.015
Hop on, my little baby.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.225
Come on, my little sweetheart.

19:02.392 --> 19:05.729
Here we are. Listen to them.

19:06.688 --> 19:09.066
Maybe the money's contaminated...

19:09.232 --> 19:11.610
...but the diamonds and the jewelry aren't.

19:11.777 --> 19:16.239
We'll put the whole city to sleep
and then we'll loot it, we'll strip it clean.

19:16.406 --> 19:19.076
But I thought Batman and Robin
were with you, Batgirl.

19:19.242 --> 19:21.620
I haven't seen them since they left the bank.

19:21.787 --> 19:27.125
- Maybe that devious devil, The Penguin--
-Don't say it, chief. Don't even think it.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.670
If Batman has been harmed...

19:31.421 --> 19:33.423
Thank heavens.

19:38.178 --> 19:41.264
Batman, are you all right?
When we didn't hear from you, we--

19:41.431 --> 19:44.893
Yes, commissioner, Robin and I
had some important matters to attend to.

19:45.060 --> 19:46.103
Is Batgirl there?

19:46.269 --> 19:48.146
- Yes, she is.
-Good.

19:49.314 --> 19:53.110
Yes, sir. Very well.
Don't worry, we'll be there.

19:54.194 --> 19:57.114
We're to meet them
at Gotham National Bank.

20:06.998 --> 20:10.377
The fruit flies really did their work.
They're all sleeping like babies.

20:10.544 --> 20:12.671
Even this mutton-headed police chief.

20:12.838 --> 20:16.717
Of course he looks like he's sleeping
even when he's awake. What have we got here?

20:16.883 --> 20:20.637
A watch. This is no more than I deserve.
A very fine watch.

20:20.804 --> 20:23.640
You won't be needing a watch
where you're going.

20:23.807 --> 20:26.184
- What?
-You'll need a calendar.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.311
A 20-year calendar.

20:28.478 --> 20:32.733
This is impossible. You're all infected
with Lygerian Sleeping Sickness.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.527
Oh, you see,
that's what happens, Pengy-poo...

20:35.694 --> 20:39.322
...when you send out a fly to do a man's job.

20:39.489 --> 20:42.409
That's right, Pengy-poo.
We're just sleepwalking.

20:42.576 --> 20:45.704
What do you say
to a little sleep-fighting, Robin?

20:45.871 --> 20:47.539
Good idea, Batgirl.

20:47.706 --> 20:50.333
- Get them finks! Get them!
-We'll handle this.

21:04.556 --> 21:05.849
Get them!

21:42.427 --> 21:44.012
Hwah, hwah, hwah.

21:45.847 --> 21:50.310
No! Take your fumbling fingers
off my person, Batman.

21:50.477 --> 21:54.731
You used a foul trick
to murder those innocent fruit flies.

21:54.898 --> 21:57.567
You murdered them, Penguin,
when you let them out.

21:57.734 --> 22:01.238
My recent research on Lygerian fruit flies
has proved conclusively...

22:01.404 --> 22:04.491
...that Gotham City's
45-degree temperatures...

22:04.658 --> 22:06.910
...caused an inversion of air layers.

22:07.077 --> 22:11.998
Which, in turn, raised the atmospheric pressure
and crushed the flies to death.

22:12.165 --> 22:14.584
- That's right, Batgirl.
- I've been tricked.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.253
You tricked yourself, Penguin.

22:16.419 --> 22:20.632
Just as you did when you had that doctor
give you a double dose of B-6 vaccine.

22:20.799 --> 22:25.345
So large a dose, you'll probably contract
Lygerian Sleeping Sickness yourself.

22:25.512 --> 22:28.932
Me? Ha, ha. That's impose--

22:29.099 --> 22:34.855
You know what? That's impossible.
That's impo-- What?

22:35.021 --> 22:36.565
Impossible.

22:38.483 --> 22:42.070
- Well, you stopped the Penguin cold, Batman.
-Cold indeed.

22:42.237 --> 22:44.114
Now, how did you know it would be cold?

22:44.281 --> 22:46.700
I consulted a very
reliable weather forecaster...

22:46.867 --> 22:49.953
...who predicted that
today would be clear and cool.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.455
Well, he was certainly right
about it being cool...

22:52.622 --> 22:55.667
...but those clouds up there
don't look very clear.

22:57.794 --> 23:03.508
After all, even the best of Weathermen
is entitled to an occasional miss.

23:07.178 --> 23:11.308
It was very nice of each of you
to drop by separately and unannounced.

23:11.474 --> 23:15.312
I was in the neighborhood, Barbara, and I
thought you might buy me a cup of coffee.

23:15.478 --> 23:19.649
Oh, make that two cups, Barbara.
I just get tired being at the office.

23:19.816 --> 23:23.987
I don't blame you, Daddy. I'm amazed
your office does everything it manages to do.

23:24.154 --> 23:26.823
Foiling Penguin
and his tainted money scheme...

23:26.990 --> 23:30.368
...and ridding Gotham City
of those deadly Lygerian fruit flies.

23:30.535 --> 23:34.915
Oh, but as usual, Barbara, the majority of credit
goes to Batman and Robin.

23:35.081 --> 23:40.253
- Don't forget to mention Batgirl, commissioner.
-Yes, yes, a remarkable young woman.

23:40.420 --> 23:43.757
I wonder who in the world she really is.

23:46.134 --> 23:47.594
Hello.

23:47.761 --> 23:50.764
Yes, Bonnie, he's right here. Daddy.

23:55.018 --> 23:57.270
What is it, Bonnie?

23:58.021 --> 24:00.815
Warden Crichton on the other phone, yes.

24:02.025 --> 24:08.531
Calling about two women who keep
visiting Shame at Gotham State Prison?

24:08.907 --> 24:11.701
Calamity Jan and Frontier Fanny?

24:11.868 --> 24:14.412
Staying somewhere in Gotham City.

24:14.579 --> 24:17.707
Tell the warden I'll look into it at once.

24:18.249 --> 24:22.170
<i>NARRATOR". But little does Commissioner
Gordon know what he's about to see...</i>

24:22.337 --> 24:27.884
<i>...or what trouble that double-dealing
desperado Shame is hatching right now...</i>

24:28.051 --> 24:32.097
<i>...with Calamity Jan and Frontier Fanny
in the prison visiting room...</i>

24:32.263 --> 24:37.769
<i>...and which will explode
before everyone's eyes on our next episode.</i>
