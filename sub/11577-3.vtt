Last time on Lost Girl:

00:07.216 --> 00:07.966
[PERSEPHONE] This is Tartarus.

00:08.176 --> 00:11.293
I am Persephone. Wife of Hades.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.218
And I am your stepmother.

00:15.057 --> 00:16.183

00:16.392 --> 00:17.507
l was born in Hell.

00:17.727 --> 00:18.591
[PERSEPHONE]
Hades would gloat about

00:18.811 --> 00:20.187
what his daughter
would become.

00:20.396 --> 00:22.762
You're not a god.
You're a coward.

00:22.982 --> 00:24.813
[BO] I got your candle.

00:26.277 --> 00:28.313
For my family.
So they know I'm safe.

00:30.323 --> 00:32.484
I can't keep being a lost
human in the Fae world

00:32.700 --> 00:34.736
[KENZI] trying to be Fae.
I'm not Fae.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.067
I need to go.

00:36.287 --> 00:46.288
[dance music plays]

01:03.189 --> 01:04.599
[DYSON] You sure you don't
want to use a bigger roller?

01:04.815 --> 01:06.726
Uh, size isn't everything.
And you have to admit,

01:06.943 --> 01:08.149
this one's pretty cute.

01:08.361 --> 01:09.521
Sure.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.193
You know you had to
prime this wall first, right?

01:11.405 --> 01:12.781
And take valuable time
away from picking out

01:12.990 --> 01:15.026
the perfect painting outfit?

01:15.243 --> 01:16.232
[DYSON] You know what?
You're right.

01:16.452 --> 01:17.202
Time well spent.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.366
Every occasion is an occasion,

01:18.579 --> 01:20.865
so you might
as well dress for it.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.949
Sounds like wise Kenzi words.

teach me how to shoot pool?

01:34.136 --> 01:39.881
I don't think we've actually
used a pool table to shoot pool.

01:44.313 --> 01:45.689
There's no
strings attached here,

01:45.898 --> 01:46.978
if that's what
you're worried about.

01:47.191 --> 01:49.933
I'm not worried.

03:02.892 --> 03:04.803
Once again proving
just because you're Fae

03:05.019 --> 03:06.600

There's a

Healthy. She's pretty too.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.475
Any connection between
her and the other two?

04:33.691 --> 04:36.307
No, nothing yet.
One was a VP. Family man.

04:36.527 --> 04:40.270
The other's a bike courier
taking classes at night school.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.025
The key is this Fae blood.

04:42.241 --> 04:43.151

what preserved the bodies.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.255
You gonna get that?

05:00.468 --> 05:02.129
I think this is a little
more important, Dyson.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.209
Someone begs to differ.

Oh, come on, Dyson.
It's not that big a deal.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.961
It is to the Fae.

bit of a walking target.

Uh, well, when have I not
been a walking target, Dyson?

Ooh. Harsh. A first for me.

12:24.578 --> 12:28.446
Yeah, well, it's common for the
guy to take off in the morning.

12:28.665 --> 12:32.123
I can't do that.

12:32.336 --> 12:34.577
Care to explain why?

12:36.798 --> 12:39.380
A fail-safe assassin has
been tapped to kill me.

12:39.593 --> 12:43.802
Sucks. Looks like
you need a bodyguard.

12:45.223 --> 12:47.384
It's a good thing
I already have two.

12:49.895 --> 12:51.726
[TAMSIN groans]

12:56.485 --> 12:59.272
This the fish that
almost killed you?

12:59.488 --> 13:04.573
That's hamachi. The assassin
used a rare breed of piranha.

13:04.785 --> 13:08.152
Big Tak'o. It's kind
of his signature.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.495
Those are some hands.

13:14.711 --> 13:18.078
Thanks to grandma Yuki Onna.
It's not even their best trick.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.004
So what are we up against?

13:20.217 --> 13:22.128
The best. Tak'o was
the top competition from

13:22.344 --> 13:24.676
my bounty hunter days.

13:24.888 --> 13:28.506
[war chanting music plays]

13:30.978 --> 13:35.062
Wait. You're not that Musashi?

13:37.067 --> 13:38.853
The Musashi?

13:39.069 --> 13:40.400
Musashi, Musashi!

13:40.612 --> 13:41.852
Ow.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.733
In the flesh.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.940
[TAMSIN sighs]
I can die in peace.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.319
Care to fill a country girl in?

13:47.536 --> 13:50.073
Yes. Musashi fought
and won one of the

13:50.288 --> 13:52.779
greatest battles
in all of Fae history.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.080
The greatest.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.544
Oh, and he's humble.

13:56.753 --> 13:57.663
[sighs]

13:57.879 --> 14:00.871
From within the darkness
evil spread across the land,

14:01.091 --> 14:05.505
and the great Musashi
rode in on a ray of sun.

14:05.721 --> 14:08.007
Musashi called forth the wind,

14:08.223 --> 14:11.135
[TAMSIN] commanding a great
blizzard to distract the army.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.138
And though miles away,
Musashi lept over the army

14:14.354 --> 14:18.347
and landed at the warlord's
feet with a blade to his throat.

14:18.567 --> 14:21.855
And then I suppose he slept with
the village's thirty virgins?

14:22.779 --> 14:27.148
Forty. My honor
and skills are unmatched.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.277
Seriously?

14:28.493 --> 14:30.233
I beg your pardon,
great Musashi.

14:30.454 --> 14:33.070
I didn't realize pouring
tea was such a difficult task.

14:33.290 --> 14:34.951
If my girls weren't
so hungover from

14:35.167 --> 14:36.623
accompanying you last night,

14:36.835 --> 14:39.451
[WOMAN] they could
pour your tea instead,

14:39.671 --> 14:41.753
Exalted One.

14:46.511 --> 14:49.503
Tomoe. My charming sister.

14:49.723 --> 14:50.838
Only sibling?

14:51.058 --> 14:52.969
Three brothers.

14:53.185 --> 14:57.474
Haru. Osamu. Craig.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.395
So if you are
such a god among Fae,

14:59.608 --> 15:03.066
why is someone
trying to kill you?

15:03.278 --> 15:05.690
It may have something
to do with this.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.581
He's ascending.

15:21.797 --> 15:24.789
[TAMSIN] Becoming
king of his ancestors.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.544
A god.

15:33.225 --> 15:36.843
To what do I owe the
privilege, Doctor Lewis?

15:37.062 --> 15:39.895
Train me. Like you did Kenzi.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.268
You don't exactly
scream shadow thief.

15:42.484 --> 15:45.976
Well, l was thinking less panty
removal, more self-defense.

15:46.196 --> 15:47.732
I thought you said there
was nothing to worry about.

15:47.948 --> 15:50.610
Well, last night's
tango with a broom...

15:50.826 --> 15:53.112
gave me time to rethink.

15:53.328 --> 15:54.738
Okay.

15:55.664 --> 15:58.371
Take your coat off.
We can start with some basics.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.165
What? Now?

16:01.378 --> 16:03.744
You wanna wait until
after you're attacked?

16:13.223 --> 16:15.680
Do you wanna put your shirt on?

16:15.892 --> 16:18.679
I'd hate to offend your
delicate sensibilities, doc.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.573
Happy?

16:30.782 --> 16:32.818
Delighted.

16:33.034 --> 16:34.649
Show me how you defend yourself.

16:34.870 --> 16:35.859
Um, |--

16:36.079 --> 16:37.239
Okay. Uh, Dyson, wait.

16:37.455 --> 16:39.946
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.828
Keep your eyes open.

16:42.043 --> 16:45.206
Okay. Gah, is this what
your foreplay with Bo is like?

16:45.422 --> 16:47.253
Okay. Um. M-M-M-Maybe
we can start with

16:47.465 --> 16:49.251
something a little simpler?

16:49.467 --> 16:51.207
You turned a Fae into a human.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.589
Your life isn't
simple anymore, Lauren.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.547
Now defend yourself.

16:57.767 --> 17:00.429
Well, does it have to
be so extreme, Dyson?

17:00.645 --> 17:02.761
[DYSON]
Extreme is your new reality.

17:02.981 --> 17:05.939
Whether you like it or not.

17:06.151 --> 17:07.436
You know what?
This was a mistake.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.688
I never should
have come. It's...

17:11.198 --> 17:13.814
Lauren wait. Wait.

see how you moved.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.699
But you're warmed up. We'll find
something that works for you.

17:19.915 --> 17:21.280
[DYSON] We can
run some practice tests.

17:21.499 --> 17:24.036
Test. See, I like tests.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.833
Yeah.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.456
Okay.

17:29.257 --> 17:30.246
[BO] Let's find
out who called the hit

17:30.467 --> 17:32.207
so we can get
them to call it off.

17:32.427 --> 17:34.839
[MUSASHI] Maybe a survivor
from the Koretoki clan.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.670
To think I still have enemies...

17:36.890 --> 17:39.256
[TAMSIN] Well, take it from me,
if you don't have enemies,

17:39.476 --> 17:40.591
you're doing something wrong.

17:40.810 --> 17:41.890
[MUSASHI] Honor is very important.

17:42.103 --> 17:45.721
[MAN yelling]

17:46.733 --> 17:51.227
If you're going to kill me,
at least tell me who sent you.

17:54.032 --> 17:59.493
[MAN panting]

17:59.704 --> 18:02.195
I didn't know it was you.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.747
Exalted One, please
accept my life as penance

18:04.960 --> 18:06.916
for this grave insult.

18:10.757 --> 18:15.296

No. No.

18:22.811 --> 18:23.675
Feed off of me.

18:23.895 --> 18:26.432
No. I can't.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.559
I can't.

Assassin down. Unknown
person who hired assassin,

18:35.782 --> 18:36.942
still at large.

18:37.158 --> 18:41.993
[LAUREN] Deep breath.
Just a little prick.

18:42.205 --> 18:43.866
I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

18:44.082 --> 18:47.540
[LAUREN] Yeah, well, I've never
had to stitch you up before.

18:47.752 --> 18:48.832
It's like you're human.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.660
Yeah. We're the same now.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.087
No, no, no. No.
This is a minor set back.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.167
Before you know it, you'll be
back to your Succubus-self.

18:56.386 --> 18:59.048
I don't know what is wrong with
me. I tried feeding off Tamsin.

18:59.264 --> 19:02.256
Oh. Well... [chuckles] Tamsin.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.467
Well not just Tamsin. Dyson too.

professional help you heal?

19:54.235 --> 19:55.065
That is a problem.

19:55.278 --> 19:56.188
Yeah, I told you.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.781
Bo, it's nothing to be ashamed
of. There could be many causes--

19:58.990 --> 20:01.481
Look, it's not that I
don't want to. I want to.

20:01.701 --> 20:02.235
It happens.

20:02.452 --> 20:03.612
No. Not to me.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.409
[LAUREN] Bo, it's perfectly
normal from time to time

20:05.622 --> 20:07.078
not to want to.

was before I even knew I could.

this vulnerable before.

You get any injury, and your
life could be in danger.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.563
Just promise me
that you'll be careful.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.688
I promise.

Trick. Did Aife ever go
through... a dry spell?

21:03.763 --> 21:08.723
Um. The year my daughter
lost interest in... you know...

21:08.935 --> 21:10.436
was the longest year of my life.

21:10.645 --> 21:13.682
Year? Like a weird sprite
year that translates into

21:13.898 --> 21:16.310
maybe two Succubus days?

21:16.526 --> 21:23.193
[TRICK] For Fae, um, sex is...
an important release.

21:23.408 --> 21:29.620
For you, a Succubus, the um, uh,

21:29.831 --> 21:33.073
orgasm, is particularly vital.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.079
You just said "orgasm."

21:35.295 --> 21:36.125
[sighs]

21:36.337 --> 21:39.670
lt's conceivable that because
of the year that you've had--

21:39.883 --> 21:44.502
the deaths,
going to Hell, Kenzi leaving...

21:44.721 --> 21:46.177
It could be psychological.

21:46.389 --> 21:47.504
[BO] Maybe this is a good thing.

21:47.724 --> 21:50.386
No power, no responsibility,
no being "The One."

I can be free.

It's one of the brothers.

21:59.444 --> 22:01.730
[B0] The picture that
we found on Big Tak'o?

22:01.946 --> 22:04.562
Musashi said Craig took it while
on a secret party trip in Osaka.

22:04.782 --> 22:06.773
He's the only one
who could have it.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.154
Jealous Craig?
Next in line to ascend?

22:09.370 --> 22:12.032
But we can't let Craig know
Musashi questioned his loyalty.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.408
[TAMSIN] He's big on honor.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.081
So we tread lightly.

22:15.293 --> 22:18.785
Yeah, that's not my forte.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.541
I got this.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.806
You're new.

22:40.026 --> 22:43.109
[CRAIG]
I can tell by your touch.

22:43.321 --> 22:45.733
How's the pressure?

22:45.949 --> 22:52.570
You don't need lotion.
My skin is... naturally lubricated.

22:52.789 --> 22:57.453
Yes. You are rather... slippery.

22:58.753 --> 23:05.465
I am new, but I'm here to
please you. And your brothers.

23:05.677 --> 23:09.295
It is the greatest escape
from the pressures of the day.

23:09.514 --> 23:13.723
Mmm. What can I say? It's...

23:15.979 --> 23:18.812
[CRAIG] Mmm. Spiritual.

23:19.023 --> 23:23.016
I can see that.

23:23.236 --> 23:25.978
Do you ever bring Musashi?

23:26.197 --> 23:29.735
With all the
pressure he's under?

23:29.951 --> 23:33.364
Musashi? Not often, no.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.322
Well why not include
the ascending one?

23:38.084 --> 23:41.121
I asked for a deep tissue,
not an interrogation.

23:41.337 --> 23:44.420
You. What do you want?

You're getting in the way.

My brother can't ascend.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.969
It was you.

24:00.189 --> 24:01.690
You ordered the hit.

24:01.899 --> 24:06.313
To save him.
Before it's too late.

24:11.701 --> 24:13.566
Musashi cannot ascend.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.697
Not if his sister's
calling hits on him, he can't.

24:15.913 --> 24:17.619
[TOMOE] No,
you don't understand.

24:17.832 --> 24:19.538
If he attempts to
ascend at the ceremony,

24:19.751 --> 24:21.537
he will turn into this...

24:26.591 --> 24:27.580
This can't be a real thing.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.052
[TOMOE]
It is. It's an akaname.

24:30.261 --> 24:32.001
If someone is dishonest
with our ancestors,

24:32.221 --> 24:33.131
they bestow this fate.

24:33.348 --> 24:34.838
So Musashi is lying?

It would be dishonorable
for me to say.

24:40.688 --> 24:43.555

saga wasn't him?

24:43.775 --> 24:45.982
He's not a bad man.

he's come to believe it.

24:50.865 --> 24:53.652
If he's not the warrior, who is?

in revealing a truth

24:59.374 --> 25:02.161
So you called the hit
because death is better than

25:02.377 --> 25:04.709
becoming a human plunger?

25:05.672 --> 25:08.414
I knew Big Tak'o would
never kill the Exalted One.

25:08.633 --> 25:09.918
No one would.

25:10.134 --> 25:11.749

to scare Musashi into

25:11.969 --> 25:14.551
finding his truth again.

If Musashi could admit his
dishonor, he'd be saved.

[TAMSIN] What?
What are you talking about?

25:36.119 --> 25:37.029
He'll be safe now.

25:37.245 --> 25:37.859
He's not the real deal.

25:38.079 --> 25:40.195
If he ascends, he'll
turn into an edamame.

25:40.415 --> 25:44.704
Mm. Delicious. Oh, wait.
You mean akaname?

25:44.919 --> 25:45.783
Filth licker?

25:46.003 --> 25:47.539
[TAMSIN]
Yeah. That's the one.

25:47.755 --> 25:48.710
Ugh!

25:48.923 --> 25:51.005
Eternity spent
as a toilet brush.

25:51.217 --> 25:52.423
[TAMSIN] There's a
fate worse than death.

25:52.635 --> 25:53.715
It's time to pull back
the curtains on the

25:53.928 --> 25:56.294
great and powerful
Musashi. Suit up.

25:56.514 --> 25:58.220
Got one of those for me?

26:01.394 --> 26:04.352
Oh! My Kill Bill Part 1
and 2 fantasy's coming true.

26:04.564 --> 26:06.395
Let's take down an ascension.

26:07.734 --> 26:12.023
May the feet of the Exalted
One never touch the ground.

26:19.620 --> 26:22.532
[distant footsteps]

26:25.460 --> 26:27.075
[NINJA 1 grunts and yells]

26:27.295 --> 26:30.787
[NINJA 2 grunts and yells]

26:32.049 --> 26:36.418
[NINJA 3 grunts and yells]

26:36.637 --> 26:37.547
[TAMSIN speaking Japanese]

26:37.764 --> 26:39.004
[BO] What?

26:39.223 --> 26:40.759
[TAMSIN] Go!

26:54.614 --> 26:57.447
[FEMALE NINJA grunting]

26:57.658 --> 27:00.991
[TAMSIN'S VOICE] And the great
Musashi rode in on a ray of sun.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.279
[FEMALE NINJA] Hiya!

27:05.500 --> 27:06.706
[TAMSIN'S VOICE]
Musashi called forth the wind,

27:06.918 --> 27:10.502
commanding a great
blizzard to distract the army.

27:17.136 --> 27:22.597
Musashi lept over the army and
landed at the warlord's feet.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.765
[BO] Putting a
blade to his throat.

27:28.064 --> 27:30.726
And the war was over.

27:30.942 --> 27:32.523
What have you done?

27:32.735 --> 27:35.442
[BO] Dirty laundry, meet air.

27:35.655 --> 27:38.362
Musashi is not
the true Exalted One.

27:41.536 --> 27:43.572
The honor belongs to Tomoe.

27:47.834 --> 27:51.952
Musashi? Care to explain?

27:54.423 --> 27:59.258
Someone assumed
it was me. I didn't--

28:02.473 --> 28:04.259
I never denied it. |--

28:04.475 --> 28:08.935
All this time,
it was our sister.

28:10.982 --> 28:12.392
Tomoe.

28:14.527 --> 28:17.064
You are the Exalted One.

28:21.409 --> 28:25.322
That's right. Bow down, bitches.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.298
You sure this is my thing?

28:36.507 --> 28:38.589
From the wrist.
Not the whole arm.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.421
[throwing star clangs]

28:41.637 --> 28:42.968
Okay, if you were
at your clinic right now

28:43.180 --> 28:45.967
and you were attacked,
what would you use?

28:48.227 --> 28:49.433
[LAUREN] For paralysis,
a tabun spray.

28:49.645 --> 28:51.385
And to kill: digoxin.

28:51.606 --> 28:53.346
Or I could go classic
with a good ol' fashioned

28:53.566 --> 28:54.681
batrachotoxin dart.

28:54.901 --> 28:56.812
[makes dart noise]

28:57.028 --> 28:58.143
What?

28:58.362 --> 29:00.353
If you could throw
with the same passion

29:00.573 --> 29:03.610
you apply to your science,
we'd be gettin' somewhere.

29:03.826 --> 29:05.612
Now remember: wrist.

29:05.828 --> 29:06.863
[sighs]

29:07.079 --> 29:08.410
I wanna try the axe again.

29:08.623 --> 29:09.988
Maybe when you're
a little less agitated.

29:10.207 --> 29:11.242
Well, maybe you
could give me something

29:11.459 --> 29:12.619
other than "from the wrist."

29:12.835 --> 29:13.870
What do you want?
A physics equation?

29:14.086 --> 29:14.871
Do you have one?

29:15.087 --> 29:17.624
It's about listening to
your gut. Your instinct.

29:17.840 --> 29:18.955
You have one, right?

29:19.175 --> 29:21.962
Well, Dyson, I'm usually fixing
the damage these things cause.

29:22.178 --> 29:23.964
Okay, good.
And why do you do that?

29:24.180 --> 29:26.546
Because I'm a doctor.
I help people. I save them.

29:26.766 --> 29:29.132
[DYSON] Well think of
this as the same thing.

29:29.352 --> 29:33.186
We keep you safe so you
can keep saving others.

29:33.981 --> 29:36.097
Like Bo.

29:36.317 --> 29:38.273
Yeah, like Bo.

29:39.862 --> 29:42.604
What's wrong?

29:42.823 --> 29:45.986
Back at the portal I stopped
Bo from saving Kenzi.

29:46.202 --> 29:47.408
[DYSON] I don't know if
it was the right thing to do

29:47.620 --> 29:49.702
or the wrong thing, but...

29:49.914 --> 29:55.659
what I know for certain is
that Bo blames me. Always will.

29:55.878 --> 29:58.460
Hm. I wish.

29:59.465 --> 30:02.673
[LAUREN] |--| wish she blamed
you, Dyson. Or me. Or... Trick.

30:02.885 --> 30:06.719
Or Jean Luc Picard
for all I care, but...

30:06.931 --> 30:08.887
Bo blames herself.

30:09.976 --> 30:11.386
Weight of the world.

30:11.602 --> 30:14.514
Rests on her very
attractive shoulders.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.475
So it's not me?

30:17.692 --> 30:21.184
[LAUREN]
No. It's not just you.

30:21.404 --> 30:22.314
And you guys?

30:22.530 --> 30:25.021
You know, what? I think what
Bo needs right now is a friend.

30:25.241 --> 30:26.651
Now.

30:29.704 --> 30:30.864
From the gut.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.570
From the gut.

30:34.875 --> 30:37.582
You're okay.

30:37.795 --> 30:41.879
Everything is okay.

30:42.091 --> 30:45.549
You're strong. You're smart.

30:45.761 --> 30:47.547
You're sexy.

30:51.434 --> 30:53.925
I was meant to ascend.

30:54.145 --> 30:56.602
[MUSASHI]
The honor was mine.

30:56.814 --> 30:59.521
You ruined everything.

31:54.288 --> 31:57.280
Bo, please feed off of me.

31:58.542 --> 32:00.578
[TRICK] Lauren, what's happening?

32:00.795 --> 32:04.834
There's no medical explanation.
It doesn't make sense. Suction!

32:10.805 --> 32:11.920
[beeping]

32:12.139 --> 32:12.924
[LAUREN]
She's stabilized, Dyson.

32:13.140 --> 32:15.677
But the internal damage is bad.

32:17.686 --> 32:18.596
If she doesn't feed--

32:18.813 --> 32:20.349
It's really stupid
what you're doing.

32:20.564 --> 32:22.520
Tamsin.

32:25.986 --> 32:27.942
This is who you are now.

32:28.155 --> 32:30.237
I don't wanna do this.

32:30.449 --> 32:31.825
You wanna leave?

32:32.034 --> 32:33.023
--[BO] Ah!
--[TAMS|N] Fine.

32:33.244 --> 32:34.154
--[TRICK] Enough!
--[LAUREN] What're you doing?

You wanna pack it in?
Let me help you out.

32:36.413 --> 32:37.448
Tamsin, stop it.
You're gonna kill her.

32:37.665 --> 32:40.247
[TAMSIN]
It's what she wants.

32:40.459 --> 32:43.542
You heard me. Leave.

32:43.754 --> 32:46.837
I lose everyone.

32:47.049 --> 32:51.213
My mom, dad,
Kyle, Rainer, Hale...

32:55.599 --> 32:57.135
Kenzi.

32:58.477 --> 32:59.466
Bo.

32:59.687 --> 33:02.349
She's gone, Trick.

33:02.565 --> 33:04.521
[BO] Who's next?

33:07.444 --> 33:10.106
I mean, that's what
being The One is, right?

33:10.322 --> 33:15.362
[B0] The queen marching
forward, never looking back.

33:15.578 --> 33:20.117
It's only a matter of time
before I lose all of you.

33:23.544 --> 33:28.129
I will always be alone.

33:28.340 --> 33:32.925
We share the same blood.
Wherever you go, I go.

33:33.137 --> 33:35.253
You will never be alone.

33:35.472 --> 33:38.839
Bo. You stole my heart.

33:39.059 --> 33:40.515
And I am never
gonna ask for it back.

33:40.728 --> 33:43.140
You will never be alone.

33:47.109 --> 33:49.020
I'm not going anywhere.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.447
Ever.

34:06.754 --> 34:09.211
Oh.

34:09.423 --> 34:11.960

It's really um... bright.

34:29.610 --> 34:32.647
Yeah. Yeah.
It's not the worst is it?

34:32.863 --> 34:34.364
No.

So, uh, you--
you okay with, you know,

34:46.752 --> 34:49.619
what's goin' on in there?

34:49.838 --> 34:51.749
Oh.

34:51.966 --> 34:53.752
Bo and l are friends so...

34:53.968 --> 34:57.335
Yes. I am okay with
what's going on in there.

That's--That's good.

that you are full of surprises

35:20.786 --> 35:26.782

are down right horrible.

But, sometimes...

35:32.006 --> 35:35.874
every once in a while...

35:36.093 --> 35:38.209
they're just
what everybody needs.

Get it together.

Is that green? Jasmine?

A subtle blend of stab-in-back?

You survived.

36:17.718 --> 36:18.798
[BO] Yes.

36:19.011 --> 36:20.751
So you'll keep an eye on him?

He will pay his
debt to our family.

overflowed, again.

you came here to do isn't it?

one with honor.

36:49.958 --> 36:51.368
You don't know what it's like.

36:51.585 --> 36:53.826
You betrayed the people
that were there for you.

36:54.046 --> 36:56.833
I was "The One."
I was their leader.

36:57.049 --> 37:00.382
I couldn't
reveal that I was weak.

37:00.594 --> 37:04.303
Being open doesn't make you weak.

37:04.515 --> 37:06.471
It's honest.

know what that's like.

Oh, heh.

37:24.785 --> 37:27.697
Actually, I do.

And it's bullshit.

I help her heal from
time to time, okay?

You really quitting the force?

Yeah. I'm gonna quit my well
paying job with a pension

40:00.899 --> 40:03.891
Um, Kickstarter. Hey. Do you
have any money for spy cams?

40:04.111 --> 40:06.397
[DYSON] Well after seeing
you guys in action...

40:06.613 --> 40:11.198
Yes, you were a hot mess.
But I think it works.

Come on. The guys at the shop
will miss me too much.

get something under control.

40:31.722 --> 40:33.428
I used my gut.

40:33.640 --> 40:34.880
Well done.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.681
And any news on
the Fae blood sample?

40:36.893 --> 40:38.554
No, not even close.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.887
No. I've checked it against
ever single database.

40:42.107 --> 40:43.688
This has never happened before.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.232
Must be dealing with
something hella old.

40:48.238 --> 40:50.399
[BO] Hey, guys.

40:50.616 --> 40:51.856
Are we watching a movie or not?

40:52.075 --> 40:52.700
[LAUREN] Of course.

40:52.909 --> 40:54.069
Yes.

40:54.286 --> 40:55.401
Wine or beer, Bo?

40:55.621 --> 40:55.985
Beer me.

40:56.204 --> 40:56.738
Okay.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.456
--[DYSON] Me too.
--[TAMS|N] Me three.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.833
Okay. What's it gonna be?

41:03.045 --> 41:06.708
Rom-com? Trashy sci-fi?
Period drama?

41:06.923 --> 41:08.629
[TAMS|N, LAUREN, and DYSON]
Horror.

41:08.842 --> 41:09.831
Horror?

41:10.052 --> 41:11.963
--[DYSON] Yeah.
--[BO] Horror it is.

41:12.179 --> 41:13.544
Oh yeah, yeah.
Werewolves. Come on.

41:13.764 --> 41:14.628
No way.

41:14.848 --> 41:15.553
[laughs]

41:15.766 --> 41:18.007
[banging]

41:20.979 --> 41:28.897
[panting]

42:06.983 --> 42:08.848
[LISA giggling]

42:09.069 --> 42:13.028
No way this date can
be worse than the last guy.

42:13.240 --> 42:14.480
Yeah. The one
that checked his Tinder

42:14.700 --> 42:16.736
while I was mid
jalapeﬁo popper.

42:16.952 --> 42:18.067
[chuckles]

42:18.286 --> 42:21.153
Ugh. I should've
worn a better bra.

42:22.708 --> 42:24.448
Can you see me?

42:24.668 --> 42:27.330
Can. You. See. Me?

42:28.171 --> 42:29.126
Say it.

42:29.339 --> 42:31.204
I... I can see you.

42:31.425 --> 42:34.667
Good. For me.

42:34.886 --> 42:36.296
For you?

42:56.450 --> 42:58.361
Hm.

42:58.577 --> 43:00.192
Thanks.

43:01.955 --> 43:03.491
I needed that.

43:06.209 --> 43:11.203
[ending theme]
