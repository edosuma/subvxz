01:40.000 --> 01:43.846
- Yeah.
- I know you're a good person.

01:50.520 --> 01:53.683
So how long are you staying in Rome?

01:54.920 --> 01:57.002
I fly back to Moscow tomorrow.

01:57.120 --> 02:00.727
What a coincidence! So do I.

02:00.840 --> 02:04.765
- You fly to Moscow?
- Back to Spain.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.891
- This is my hotel.
- Mine is down there on the left.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.288
- So, this is closer.
- For you, yes.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.085
- For you too.
- No.

02:18.200 --> 02:23.366
Come on. Please, just a little
stop, to drink the last one.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.761
We drank plenty in the bar.

02:25.880 --> 02:30.761
Yes, but we only talked about
Russia and Spain, not about us.

02:31.840 --> 02:34.127
I prefer not to talk about us.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.288
It's a deal.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.368
- What is?
- We don't talk.

02:39.520 --> 02:43.286
We can stay without talking, you know?
And even better.

02:46.320 --> 02:50.370
See, that's my room.
It's got two flags.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.568
Must be a reason, no?

02:52.680 --> 02:56.685
Yes, one for Europe and one for Rome.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.644
I'm talking about
what's in the middle.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.684
- The middle flag is missing.
- Exactly.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.441
That's because of you.
You have to come up and hang it there.

03:06.600 --> 03:10.002
- And what do I hang there?
- I don't know.

03:10.120 --> 03:14.091
Your clothes, for example.
You are long enough.

03:14.200 --> 03:17.647
Come on.

03:17.760 --> 03:21.685
I've never gone up to a woman's room.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.167
It's just a hotel room in Rome.

03:33.840 --> 03:38.846
If you keep pulling, you'll win
and we'll end up in your hotel.

03:38.960 --> 03:43.329
You choose.

05:08.400 --> 05:12.564
- Drink?
- Wine.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.569
Wine.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.320
Sorry, what was your name?

05:49.640 --> 05:52.246
I told you twice already.

05:52.360 --> 05:55.728
Maybe at the third time I get it.

05:55.840 --> 05:58.047
Natasha.

05:58.160 --> 06:01.926
Natasha.
Was that the name you said before?

06:03.600 --> 06:08.049
But you are not saying it right.
It's Nata-sha.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.650
Sha.

06:09.760 --> 06:13.810
- Sha.
- Sha.

06:13.920 --> 06:17.083
And you are Alba, which
is Spanish for dawn.

06:17.200 --> 06:20.966
That's my big moment. You'll see.

06:26.640 --> 06:29.086
Tonight is the first
night of the summer.

06:30.360 --> 06:33.648
Ah, yes, that's right, in Europe.

06:33.760 --> 06:37.810
In Russia, summer has already
begun, the first of June.

06:37.920 --> 06:41.163
Really? Do you have summer in Russia?

06:42.280 --> 06:44.886
Of course. Well, it's Russian summer.

06:47.160 --> 06:50.607
And this is my last night in Rome.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.522
Mine too.

07:04.360 --> 07:07.842
You're not on your own, little Russian.

07:07.960 --> 07:11.885
You know for sure this is
the shortest night of the year,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.925
here and in Russia, so we
have to make the most of it.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.085
I'm not...

07:41.160 --> 07:43.561
- I'm not a...
- What?

07:46.160 --> 07:48.766
Come on, you're a woman,
and... and I'm a woman

07:48.880 --> 07:51.531
and we were drinking alone at a bar

07:51.640 --> 07:55.201
and we exchanged looks
and felt attracted to one another.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.084
Isn't that how it works?

07:57.200 --> 08:00.727
It's the first time in my life
I look like this at a woman.

08:02.120 --> 08:04.600
Never before a woman looked at me this way.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.091
It's not the first time
you look at a woman like this.

08:10.200 --> 08:13.602
But every woman is different.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.328
Would you like to see me naked?

08:38.799 --> 08:42.282
I would love to.

09:05.360 --> 09:08.170
Here?

09:08.280 --> 09:11.602
Wherever you like.
Do you prefer inside?

09:13.880 --> 09:16.531
- Yes.
- Ok, let's go inside then.

10:24.520 --> 10:28.923
I think it'll work better
if you undress me.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.801
It's Ok.

12:36.806 --> 12:38.171
It's Ok.

12:42.640 --> 12:44.802
It's Ok.

12:49.520 --> 12:56.210
We'll stay like this, close but
not touching, while you relax.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.288
Yes?

14:02.320 --> 14:04.971
It's better if you're asleep.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.844
That way we don't have to say goodbye.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.886
You're right.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.604
I'll say a few words.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.570
Goodbye, Alba.

15:09.280 --> 15:12.090
I don't want to imagine
what might have happened.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.765
This secret will stay
there, sleeping with you.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.524
Thank you, Alba.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.366
Goodbye.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.127
Who changed my ring tone?

16:54.320 --> 16:57.005
What the hell happened?

17:19.599 --> 17:22.171
- Who is it?
- Natasha

17:25.880 --> 17:27.325
Natasha, right.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.286
I think I've left my mobile
in your room.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.722
- Did you hear it ringing?
- Yes, it woke me up, actually.

17:49.840 --> 17:51.649
Sorry.

17:51.760 --> 17:54.411
It must have fallen out of my bag.

17:54.560 --> 17:57.530
I'm very tired and I
want to go to my hotel.

17:57.640 --> 18:01.406
Come in and take it.
It's waiting for you under the bed.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.847
I'd rather not come in again.

18:03.960 --> 18:06.008
Why? What happened?

18:06.120 --> 18:09.203
Nothing. Nothing, actually.
Nothing we have to regret.

18:09.320 --> 18:14.247
- Why did you chew up my panties?
- I didn't chew anything.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.283
See the state you left them in.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.770
Good evening.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.565
Good evening.

18:31.680 --> 18:34.889
How thoughtful, Natasha!
I wasn't expecting this.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.048
Hey, come in
and leave it in the terrace.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.811
Sorry, madam. It's for this room.

18:39.920 --> 18:44.084
But if you want, I can come
afterwards and take your order.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.965
- Feeling hungry?
- No, no.

18:47.080 --> 18:51.085
- You heard. What's your name?
- Max.

18:51.200 --> 18:55.046
Max, we are not hungry right now
but in a couple of hours we will.

18:55.160 --> 18:58.289
You just call me. I'm free all night.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.971
I mean I'm on duty the whole night.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.002
It's there.

19:17.320 --> 19:19.607
Where is your hotel?

19:26.160 --> 19:27.889
This is Tevere...

19:28.000 --> 19:30.749
and you get to my hotel...

19:31.304 --> 19:32.815
this way.

19:44.877 --> 19:47.291
This is the Rome of the Caesars.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.643
Yes. It's a map to lose yourself.

19:50.760 --> 19:54.003
Where should we lose ourselves?
Choose.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.327
We have, um... the gardens.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.449
Tempio Della Fortuna,
Tempio Della Ninfa.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.251
My hotel is called "Ninfa".

20:05.360 --> 20:08.204
- And yours?
- Pompeo.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.402
Look, it's this way.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.642
You pass through the gardens,

20:13.760 --> 20:17.003
and... and here we are,
we are on top of the theatre.

20:17.120 --> 20:23.048
No, we are... we are inside
of Teatro di Pompeo.

20:23.160 --> 20:25.049
Wow!

20:25.160 --> 20:28.289
History's looking at us.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.370
We are surrounded.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.727
- Can you feel it'?
- How could I not?

20:33.840 --> 20:36.161
- I think you like history.
- Yes.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.328
That's good.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.884
Alba.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.970
This stays here, ok?
In this room.

23:13.080 --> 23:15.162
In Rome.

23:15.280 --> 23:18.523
Within these four walls.

23:19.520 --> 23:24.890
But since we're here,
let's have some fun, no?

23:25.000 --> 23:27.082
All I ask is that
this doesn't affect my life.

23:27.200 --> 23:33.970
- And how do you do that?
- By agreeing, the two of us.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.242
You also have a life
outside of all this

23:36.360 --> 23:39.170
that you want to protect, don't you?

23:43.000 --> 23:45.970
Very far from yours.

23:46.080 --> 23:51.371
But tomorrow Rome will send each
of us to an opposite end of Europe.

23:51.520 --> 23:54.649
- What if I'm not Russian?
- Come on, you have to be Russian.

23:54.760 --> 23:57.764
I love that.

23:57.880 --> 24:01.248
Well, then I am.

24:01.360 --> 24:04.967
What's great is not knowing
each other's name.

24:05.080 --> 24:07.162
But don't we?

24:09.120 --> 24:11.930
Don't tell me you gave me
your real name.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.288
So your name isn't Natasha?
I knew it.

24:19.600 --> 24:23.207
Alba is the name
I was going to call my daughter.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.642
What happened to her?

24:27.800 --> 24:30.280
Alba never saw the dawn.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.368
I'm sorry.

24:34.520 --> 24:37.046
That put an end
to the worst time of my life,

24:37.160 --> 24:40.289
when my Alba died inside of me.

25:02.120 --> 25:05.886
My mother took me to Marbella
one summer when I was 16.

25:06.920 --> 25:08.285
She was almost broke

25:08.400 --> 25:13.361
and what little money she had left
she spent on fortune-hunting,

25:13.520 --> 25:15.204
and she was lucky.

25:15.320 --> 25:18.051
An Arab sheik, Hamir Osemin,

25:18.160 --> 25:22.051
he... he bumped into us one day
when we were shopping

25:22.160 --> 25:26.245
and we spent the rest
of the summer in his yacht.

25:26.360 --> 25:29.842
That winter he invited us
to Saudi Arabia.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.367
He has a palace.

25:34.520 --> 25:38.241
Even if I describe it to you,
you could never imagine the luxury.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.362
He bought my mother everything.

25:40.520 --> 25:42.761
So she left there

25:42.880 --> 25:47.807
with bracelets, necklaces and rings
worth a small fortune.

25:47.920 --> 25:50.161
She left?

25:51.120 --> 25:55.364
- What about you?
- I stayed.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.682
Hamir persuaded my mother
to leave me there

25:57.800 --> 26:01.361
in exchange for a monthly allowance
for four years.

26:01.520 --> 26:06.367
That was the deal.
I was all he was interested in.

26:06.520 --> 26:08.761
So you accepted?

26:08.880 --> 26:11.247
You can't imagine
how easy it was for me,

26:11.360 --> 26:14.170
falling into that type of lifestyle.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.044
I had everything I wanted!

26:16.160 --> 26:20.563
Hamir bought me a purebred horse
that only I was allowed to ride.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.648
I began to love him like a child.

26:25.120 --> 26:28.010
Everyone around me was very nice.

26:28.120 --> 26:32.967
Also, Hamir's other wives
treated me like a real princess.

26:33.080 --> 26:35.048
And he got you pregnant?

26:35.160 --> 26:37.447
That was at the and.

26:37.600 --> 26:42.242
Hamir started to get annoyed with me
because I didn't get pregnant.

26:42.360 --> 26:46.365
That was when I wanted to leave.
But I couldn't.

26:46.520 --> 26:50.047
I'd married him so I was
his property, like my horse.

26:50.160 --> 26:53.164
He sold him to punish me.

26:53.280 --> 26:57.524
Hamir got his way, because shortly
afterwards he got me pregnant.

26:57.640 --> 26:59.881
He was over the moon.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.005
He began treating me royally again,
this time like a queen.

27:06.640 --> 27:09.769
Then I realised that
as soon as my child was born...

27:09.880 --> 27:15.125
Well, I'd be shut up
with the rest of his harem.

27:16.200 --> 27:19.204
The day the doctor told me
I was expecting a girl,

27:19.320 --> 27:22.847
an Egyptian nurse
who I'd told the story to

27:22.960 --> 27:25.691
helped me escape in a Greek ship.

27:25.800 --> 27:31.045
I arrived in Athens at dawn
so I decided to call her Alba.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.970
How did you lose her?

27:34.080 --> 27:38.051
I'd found out that Hamir
had gone to the authorities.

27:38.160 --> 27:42.290
There was a warrant out for my arrest
in Saudi Arabia.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.165
I knew that if I'd had Alba, ha...

27:45.280 --> 27:49.080
He couldn't have rested
until I was caught.

27:50.160 --> 27:54.245
I was only 18 so I got an abortion.

27:54.360 --> 27:58.888
I sold my necklace and managed
to start a new life in Spain.

28:00.400 --> 28:03.051
What about your mother?

28:03.160 --> 28:05.606
I've never seen her again.

28:07.880 --> 28:12.647
And is that how you became a lesbian?

28:14.520 --> 28:17.603
This is how I became a woman.

28:20.840 --> 28:24.322
What about you?
How did you become a woman?

28:26.600 --> 28:29.888
I don't feel
like talking about my life.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.162
You owe me.

28:37.320 --> 28:39.800
What do I owe to you?

28:39.920 --> 28:41.968
The truth or a lie?

28:42.080 --> 28:46.927
Whatever you prefer.
Why? Do you think I lied to you?

29:14.000 --> 29:16.526
It's the Agora in Athens.

29:16.640 --> 29:18.961
Did you know that?

29:20.760 --> 29:25.209
Which came first, the picture
or your story? Who inspired who?

29:25.320 --> 29:27.368
Good question.

29:28.920 --> 29:33.528
This picture has been hanging here
since before you were born.

29:33.640 --> 29:37.645
Long before, and it's been
waiting for me all this time.

29:40.560 --> 29:43.211
Let's make a deal. No stories.

29:43.320 --> 29:46.210
Just tell me where you live,
your area and everything,

29:46.320 --> 29:50.370
so I can get an idea
of your surroundings.

29:57.520 --> 30:00.888
First go to Moscow.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.527
You have
the biggest map in the world.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.526
Now go to the Volga, further east.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.804
Even further east.

30:16.920 --> 30:19.207
From there towards Ostrov Nekrasov.

30:19.320 --> 30:23.166
- Where?
- Ostrov Nekrasov.

30:23.280 --> 30:26.090
Ostrov Nekrasov.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.328
You write it, please.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.451
What is that there?

30:34.600 --> 30:36.887
Ostrov means island.

30:47.520 --> 30:51.320
Tell me this is your house
and I'll have to spank your ass.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.640
Wow!

31:00.760 --> 31:03.127
It's as hard as a rock.

31:04.640 --> 31:08.565
Hey, tell me,
what are you doing here in Rome?

31:10.000 --> 31:12.810
Auditioning. I'm an actress.

31:12.920 --> 31:15.207
A Russian film actress.

31:15.320 --> 31:21.043
Are you a good one, a very famous
one, or just married to a Mafioso?

31:21.160 --> 31:24.209
- I'm single.
- So, you must be a very good one.

31:24.320 --> 31:26.800
Congratulations.

31:26.920 --> 31:29.685
Show me your Arabian palace.

31:31.360 --> 31:33.328
It's not mine..

31:35.160 --> 31:37.367
Aren't you going to show it to me?

31:37.520 --> 31:41.889
The thing is, if Hamir finds out that
we are sniffing over his house...

31:42.000 --> 31:43.764
- What?
- He's capable of...

31:43.880 --> 31:46.850
Anything could happen to us.

31:48.160 --> 31:50.891
Look, if you don't show it to me,

31:51.000 --> 31:54.686
I'll think you are the one
who owes me a story.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.643
A true one.

31:56.760 --> 31:59.411
I want to know where you live.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.602
Look.

32:21.280 --> 32:23.203
- Do you like it?
- Is it a village?

32:23.320 --> 32:26.403
No, it's a city called San Sebastian.

32:26.560 --> 32:30.007
- Looks a bit small.
- It depends what you compare it to.

32:30.120 --> 32:31.645
Rome.

32:31.760 --> 32:37.290
I'd say about, um... 20 times smaller.

32:37.400 --> 32:41.769
Ha. Moscow is three times
the size of Rome.

32:43.200 --> 32:49.526
Well, I like it, and you look a lot
like your city. Small, pretty face.

32:49.640 --> 32:51.404
It's not my city.

32:51.560 --> 32:55.690
I'm from Valladollid,
which is like three times bigger.

32:57.160 --> 33:00.801
- Show me your house..
- It's here.

33:14.520 --> 33:17.729
- They left the chairs out..
- So?

33:17.840 --> 33:20.161
I wasn't expecting this.

33:20.280 --> 33:24.410
- What? A child?
- A boy and a girl.

33:26.000 --> 33:30.289
- You have children.
- What? Can't I be a mother?

33:31.840 --> 33:33.922
Of course.

33:40.920 --> 33:43.764
What's up, Alba?

33:43.880 --> 33:47.885
The father of your children
know you like women?

33:48.000 --> 33:51.163
It's not that.
It's the picture. It's...

33:52.760 --> 33:54.683
It's quite old.

33:54.800 --> 33:58.043
Look at the beach.
It's full of people.

33:58.160 --> 34:01.209
I'm sure we were there.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.891
Or on the island.

34:05.560 --> 34:10.009
We used to love spending Sundays
on the island.

34:10.120 --> 34:14.523
This picture is from the summer I
started living in San Sebastian.

34:14.639 --> 34:17.324
Two years ago.

34:20.760 --> 34:24.286
What's wrong?

34:31.800 --> 34:36.601
Alba, is there something
you need to tell me?

34:48.679 --> 34:50.808
Poor thing.

35:05.280 --> 35:06.770
Where did you come from?

35:08.320 --> 35:11.688
How could you just show up like this,
without warning?

35:14.560 --> 35:17.609
I can't believe I'm doing this.

35:22.400 --> 35:24.767
What are you doing to me?

35:26.160 --> 35:28.162
You're scaring ms, little Russian.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.325
Is this ms?

35:33.560 --> 35:35.528
I can't recognize myself.

35:37.520 --> 35:39.682
Russian sounds so beautiful.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.410
Only for you.

35:44.840 --> 35:48.640
I'm trembling with fear too.

36:13.880 --> 36:17.168
I'm going to give you
the best orgasm of your life.

36:17.280 --> 36:19.169
Are you ready?

36:19.280 --> 36:20.611
Yes.

36:29.200 --> 36:33.762
- You know what I'd love?
- Tell me, anything you like.

36:34.840 --> 36:38.606
Do you have a vibrator?

36:41.360 --> 36:43.761
I'll come better
if you put something inside me.

36:43.880 --> 36:45.962
I don't use vibrators.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.367
And you're not going
to need one either.

36:48.520 --> 36:51.171
I know myself.

36:53.320 --> 36:55.950
What about a little wine bottle?

36:56.320 --> 37:00.530
I don't really fancy the idea of
anything masculine coming between us.

37:02.320 --> 37:06.405
It's from "La Toscana."
Sounds very feminine.

37:06.560 --> 37:10.645
I'm not sticking anything
inside of you Natasha.

37:10.760 --> 37:13.001
Alba, don't forget I like men.

37:13.120 --> 37:15.361
But you like me as well.

37:15.520 --> 37:18.888
Yes, but I like men more.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.809
You know, I know plenty

37:20.920 --> 37:24.447
who, once they've tried it with a
woman, never want to go back to man.

37:24.600 --> 37:28.321
Well, I won't let that happen to me.

37:29.080 --> 37:32.209
In fact, I prefer the opposite.

37:32.320 --> 37:34.766
So after me
you expect to like men more?

37:34.880 --> 37:38.089
That would be terrific.

37:38.200 --> 37:40.885
It's not very nice
telling me this now.

37:48.000 --> 37:52.608
I don't want us to argue,
and even less over a bottle of wine.

37:54.200 --> 37:56.931
An empty one too.

37:59.640 --> 38:02.610
I'm going to order you something.

38:04.520 --> 38:07.046
What are you doing?

38:07.160 --> 38:11.245
Spaniards and Italians
we understand each other's language.

38:11.360 --> 38:14.170
<i>- Good evening</i>
- Yes, it is.

38:14.280 --> 38:15.430
<i>Hungry yet?</i>

38:15.520 --> 38:18.000
The lady needs a vibrator.

38:20.160 --> 38:23.528
<i>I'm sorry, we don't have any.</i>

38:23.640 --> 38:27.361
<i>But I can bring something else.
We have fruit.</i>

38:28.160 --> 38:29.685
That's not good enough.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.529
<i>Something else might work...</i>

38:31.640 --> 38:34.405
No, forget it. Thanks, Max.

38:34.560 --> 38:36.767
You are out of your mind.
You know that?

38:36.880 --> 38:38.803
I did it for you.

38:38.920 --> 38:43.164
What if Max takes it as an invitation
and comes up himself?

38:43.920 --> 38:50.451
Well, then you'll be able to choose
between Max or a bottle of wine.

38:55.600 --> 39:01.369
Well, Max comes from Maximus.

39:01.520 --> 39:04.524
It is also the diminutive of Maximus.

39:41.320 --> 39:44.369
Maximo.

39:44.520 --> 39:47.285
Max.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.969
We're fine, Max..
We don't need anything.

39:56.080 --> 39:58.003
I brought a hot cucumber.

39:58.120 --> 39:59.281
What?

39:59.400 --> 40:02.051
I boiled it for two minutes.

40:02.160 --> 40:04.401
It's sterile.

40:05.640 --> 40:08.803
My friend would rather use
the wine bottle.

40:09.520 --> 40:11.045
It's Tuscan.

40:11.160 --> 40:12.525
What about you?

40:13.000 --> 40:14.525
Me?

40:14.640 --> 40:16.881
I'm a virgin.

40:17.880 --> 40:19.211
Congratulations.

40:19.320 --> 40:22.051
Spain beat Italy.
Fair and square.

40:22.160 --> 40:25.881
What's that?
The Eurocup. Soccer.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.525
Soccer bores me.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.290
What about your friend?

40:30.400 --> 40:34.166
Her as well.
She's a Russian tennis player.

40:38.320 --> 40:40.971
What?
I love Russian tennis players.

40:43.760 --> 40:45.524
Though I'm starting to wonder.

40:46.640 --> 40:49.041
Check her arm..
What?

40:49.160 --> 40:52.448
One arm should be stronger
than the other.

40:58.160 --> 41:01.050
Yes, you are
a tennis player. Look at your right arm!

41:01.160 --> 41:04.050
I'm left-handed!

41:04.160 --> 41:08.449
I mean left, sorry. And you've got
calluses. This is the proof!

41:18.280 --> 41:20.362
You two wanna have a trio?

41:25.960 --> 41:27.849
Wanna see it first?

41:29.400 --> 41:30.845
No, Max.

41:30.960 --> 41:33.008
It's nice of you to offer, but no.

41:33.120 --> 41:35.407
You speak Italian?

41:35.560 --> 41:37.005
It's a beautiful language.

41:37.960 --> 41:40.327
Please, go. Leave us alone.

41:41.320 --> 41:43.561
I got my hopes up.

41:44.560 --> 41:46.050
I thought it's what you wanted.

41:46.160 --> 41:48.083
I'm sorry, it was a misunderstanding.

41:48.200 --> 41:50.328
We shouldn't have called you.

42:17.880 --> 42:19.030
Good night.

42:19.120 --> 42:22.203
I was only joking about the cucumber.

42:29.120 --> 42:31.646
Well, thanks to Max,

42:31.760 --> 42:36.049
I've discovered a Russian tennis
player who speaks Italian.

42:36.160 --> 42:39.130
- I like football too.
- You lied to me.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.688
That mansion on the island couldn't be yours.
There is no tennis court.

43:39.520 --> 43:42.888
So you understood me before?

43:43.000 --> 43:45.731
- When?
- When I spoke to you in Spanish.

43:45.840 --> 43:48.366
Yes, and I was thrilled.

43:48.520 --> 43:51.205
Thrilled?

43:51.320 --> 43:53.971
- To hear that you scare me?
- Yes.

43:54.080 --> 43:56.651
Come here.

44:04.000 --> 44:08.562
I'm beginning to realise that
everything about you scares me.

44:08.680 --> 44:12.162
Your eyes. Your mouth.

44:13.520 --> 44:16.046
Your smile.

44:16.160 --> 44:20.006
The way you speak.
The tone of your voice.

44:20.120 --> 44:22.885
Your smell. Your scent.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.048
Your breath.

44:25.160 --> 44:27.970
Your stunning body.

44:28.080 --> 44:30.208
Your skin.

44:30.320 --> 44:33.085
Your skin is incredible.

44:36.400 --> 44:38.721
I'm more scared by
the colour of yours.

44:38.840 --> 44:42.208
Your skin is like the Russian steppe.

44:42.320 --> 44:44.527
That's very scary.

45:00.960 --> 45:02.883
A question.

45:04.520 --> 45:09.287
If I had a twin sister,
identical in every way,

45:09.400 --> 45:12.847
with the same eyes,
same mouth, voice...

45:12.960 --> 45:15.008
And the same skin?

45:16.680 --> 45:19.570
Yes, especially the skin.

45:21.320 --> 45:25.564
- Would you be that scared?
- Do you have a twin sister?

45:25.680 --> 45:27.808
It's just hypothetical.

45:27.920 --> 45:33.404
I don't know.
Maybe I would, maybe I wouldn't.

45:33.560 --> 45:36.040
What do you prefer?

45:36.160 --> 45:41.963
I just feel very fortunate that
it's me here, and not my twin sister.

45:42.080 --> 45:44.560
Ok, you have to explain me this.

45:46.120 --> 45:51.160
I have a twin sister
with a degree in history of art.

45:52.320 --> 45:56.370
She just finished her thesis
on the Italian Renaissance.

45:56.520 --> 45:58.284
I came here with her.

45:58.400 --> 46:00.402
- What's her name?
- Dasha.

46:00.560 --> 46:03.769
Like you. Because you told me
your name was Natasha.

46:03.880 --> 46:07.089
I don't know your name either.

46:08.640 --> 46:12.042
Now I know
why your Italian is so good.

46:12.160 --> 46:15.687
I also studied history of art.

46:15.800 --> 46:19.407
But in our third year,
we both auditioned for a film

46:19.560 --> 46:21.642
and they chose me.

46:21.760 --> 46:24.240
Since then,
my sister and I drifted apart.

46:24.360 --> 46:27.204
Can you prove it?

46:27.320 --> 46:29.288
Prove?

46:50.320 --> 46:52.687
- What does that say?
- Sasha Veronina.

46:52.800 --> 46:58.170
Sasha? Natasha, Dasha, and now
Sasha? You're triplets or what?

47:01.880 --> 47:03.882
So what's with the tennis?

47:04.000 --> 47:07.049
My sister Dasha and I
have played since we were kids.

47:07.160 --> 47:10.004
But she was always better than me.

47:10.120 --> 47:12.202
When do you get to play tennis?

47:12.320 --> 47:16.450
You can't have much time between
filming, parties and premières.

47:36.200 --> 47:38.680
Can you show me your sister?

47:43.560 --> 47:47.690
Dasha is number tan
female tennis player in Russia.

47:49.320 --> 47:53.769
- And she's left-handed like you.
- Yes, I am left-handed too.

47:53.880 --> 47:57.202
There is no reason why twins
should both be left-handed,

47:57.320 --> 47:59.971
even though they're identical
in every other way.

48:00.080 --> 48:02.367
But we are.

48:03.520 --> 48:07.570
Is there not anything different
between you two?

48:08.920 --> 48:10.365
Eh?

48:21.400 --> 48:24.847
I was the first one
to become a woman.

48:24.960 --> 48:27.361
Though not like you.

48:27.520 --> 48:29.602
What do you mean?

48:33.200 --> 48:36.124
My mother died when we were 13.

48:40.200 --> 48:45.570
From that time, my father
started to treat me like a woman.

48:46.800 --> 48:49.007
He used to only touch me.

48:55.520 --> 48:57.966
And your sister?

48:58.080 --> 49:00.526
No, just me.

49:00.640 --> 49:04.042
- Why?
- I don't know.

49:04.160 --> 49:08.722
But I felt like I should keep it
secret from my sister,

49:08.840 --> 49:10.922
until one night...

49:12.080 --> 49:14.003
Dasha saw us.

49:14.120 --> 49:17.044
- How did she react?
- Badly.

49:17.160 --> 49:20.130
She felt rejected and...

49:21.840 --> 49:24.969
That's how
her inferiority complex began.

49:25.080 --> 49:29.642
She got a complex because
your father didn't touch her up?

49:29.760 --> 49:32.366
She should have been grateful.

49:32.520 --> 49:35.171
That didn't last long,
less than a year.

49:42.840 --> 49:45.684
Are you crying?

50:00.080 --> 50:02.208
You can cry if you want.

50:03.280 --> 50:05.282
The thing is I don't cry.

50:05.400 --> 50:08.961
- You don't?
- Well, I haven't in a long time.

50:09.080 --> 50:11.367
Crying is good for you.

50:11.520 --> 50:13.522
I know.

50:20.160 --> 50:22.970
So cry like an actress.
Come on, please.

50:23.080 --> 50:27.369
- Act for me.
- That's what I am doing.

50:27.520 --> 50:29.814
I will love to see you cry.

50:30.122 --> 50:33.687
Then I'll have the chance
to comfort you.

50:33.800 --> 50:35.962
Come on.

50:36.080 --> 50:38.651
Cry, cry...

50:45.520 --> 50:49.923
Sorry, Alba. I'm not a good actress.

51:05.160 --> 51:06.764
Do I sing well?

54:31.360 --> 54:34.091
I imagine in that Arabian harem,

54:34.200 --> 54:37.010
you had all kinds of relations
with women.

54:38.920 --> 54:43.084
- Or was it forbidden?
- I never lived in Saudi Arabia.

54:47.960 --> 54:51.646
- Shame. I liked that story.
- So did I.

54:51.760 --> 54:57.210
It was my mother who fled away
from Saudi Arabia in a Greek ship.

54:57.320 --> 55:00.961
She was pregnant with me,
running away from my father.

55:01.080 --> 55:06.246
I'm Hamir's daughter,
and I was born in Athens.

55:06.360 --> 55:09.728
- I'm glad Alba exists.
- Thanks.

55:09.840 --> 55:12.810
So, you are Greek not Spanish?

55:12.920 --> 55:18.689
No, few months after I was born
my mother brought me back to Spain.

55:18.800 --> 55:21.041
Did your mother
also become a lesbian?

55:21.160 --> 55:23.561
Come on!

55:23.680 --> 55:27.366
My mother had several men
and several problems,

55:27.520 --> 55:30.205
but she always took care of me
and I took care of her.

55:30.320 --> 55:33.802
And you,
have you ever been with a man?

55:33.920 --> 55:38.323
I'm a lesbian from birth,
like you are a twin from birth.

55:43.960 --> 55:48.010
Look, Alba, I... I haven't been
completely honest with you.

55:52.960 --> 55:57.045
- I'm getting married next Sunday.
- Who?

55:57.160 --> 56:00.050
- The actress or the tennis player?
- The tennis player.

56:00.160 --> 56:02.322
Dasha?

56:03.960 --> 56:06.770
So you are not the actress,
you are the twin.

56:06.880 --> 56:09.406
My sister's also a twin.

56:09.560 --> 56:12.370
Yeah, but I mean
the... the Renaissance one.

56:12.520 --> 56:14.443
You are the Renaissance one.

56:21.080 --> 56:25.210
Ok, in...
in one way I prefer it,

56:25.320 --> 56:28.449
but I... I don't like the idea
of you getting married so soon.

56:28.600 --> 56:32.571
We've been planning it
for almost a year.

56:32.680 --> 56:36.048
- Who with?
- The tutor supervising my thesis.

56:36.160 --> 56:39.687
- Is he Italian?
- No he's from Moscow.

56:39.800 --> 56:44.203
We've bought a small apartment.
We'll move in after our honeymoon.

56:44.320 --> 56:49.087
- In one of those Russian beehives?
- Yes, very different from my sister.

56:49.200 --> 56:51.771
I'm glad you are middle class.

56:52.640 --> 56:56.725
But especially happy
that your father didn't touch you up.

56:56.840 --> 56:59.889
So, then, you are the one
with the inferiority complex?

57:00.000 --> 57:02.162
I don't get it.

57:18.160 --> 57:21.767
One night I woke up and saw
my sister's bed was empty.

57:23.120 --> 57:26.010
I decided to get up
and go to my father's room.

57:28.280 --> 57:33.366
I remember his huge hands
with long and strong fingers...

57:35.560 --> 57:41.124
caressing Sashas naked body
identical to mine.

57:43.840 --> 57:47.640
I stayed there hidden for a while,
watching.

57:49.520 --> 57:54.560
It was the first time in my life
I experienced sexual pleasure.

57:57.080 --> 58:01.165
Every time I woke up
and my sister wasn't there,

58:02.360 --> 58:07.287
I undressed and touched myself.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.162
I understand you, little Russian.

58:15.160 --> 58:19.370
That put an immense distance
between Sasha and me.

58:19.520 --> 58:22.763
But now I like my life
so much more than my sister's.

58:22.880 --> 58:25.042
That's good.

58:25.160 --> 58:27.401
Now you can have your own family.

59:31.160 --> 59:34.164
<i>Please, hold still.</i>

59:34.800 --> 59:37.167
<i>Alba, you said it wrong.</i>

59:39.160 --> 59:41.208
<i>Then teach me how to say it!</i>

59:41.320 --> 59:44.403
<i>We'll hold still
when you say it right.</i>

59:47.000 --> 59:49.207
What are they speaking in?

59:49.320 --> 59:53.723
Basque. It's a very, very ancient
language. It's quite difficult.

59:53.840 --> 59:55.171
I'm trying to learn it,

59:55.280 --> 59:59.524
but every time I make mistakes,
the kids make fun of me.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.371
I want to have children too.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.408
They're Edurne's kids.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.851
- How long have you been with her?
- Two years.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:29.366
She had just separated and I had just
come out of a stormy relationship.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:32.444
One weekend she passed
through Madrid and we hooked up,

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:37.561
and a month later I moved
to San Sebastian to live with her.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.011
<i>Mommy.</i>

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.850
<i>Give me a kiss.</i>

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.648
What's wrong?

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.331
Come on, Alba, please tell me.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.885
The little boy, he died last winter.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.083
It was in a stupid accident
in the house.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.807
I haven't watched this video
since it happened.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:19.924
Edurne hasn't... hasn't got over it.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:37.723
The boy died with me at home.
We were both alone.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:39.251
Edurne doesn't blame me,

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:45.208
but I wish she could have been there
that afternoon with him

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.209
and not me.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.211
Who knows? Maybe the accident
wouldn't have happened.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.329
How do you run with these legs?

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:16.080
What a wonderful sense of speed!

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.287
I bet you sprint like a gazelle.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.169
How long have you been with him?

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:26.647
With Vadim?

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.967
Four years. Intense years.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:34.405
- And you love him?
- Actually, I do deeply.

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:38.201
I learn a lot being with him.
He is very cultured.

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.800
And he always knows what to do.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.844
Had you ever been unfaithful to him?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.604
No.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.406
Had you to Edurne?

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.409
Me neither.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.931
It hurts us both equally, right?

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:41.169
Would you like to give me
a wedding present?

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.209
Sure.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.525
These are the ones left.

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:03.530
I don't know. What do you prefer?

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.847
Whatever you choose.

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:11.967
And what do I put? From Alba,
the Spanish girl in Rome? Mm?

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.005
Well, if you were a man
it might look suspicious.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:21.763
I'll say that while I was in Rome
I meta very sweet Spanish girl.

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:25.009
- And cute.
- Gorgeous.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.168
Vale.

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:32.531
Why are you here in Rome?

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:36.850
It's a wedding present
from my sister, a week in Italy,

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.406
an attempt to bring us together.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:43.770
But tonight we had a fight
and I went off on my own.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.406
So, I met you thanks to an argument?

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.528
- Is your sister a good actress?
- Yes, very good.

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:54.849
And she can cry wonderfully.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:57.088
But it's also true
that her boyfriend is...

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:00.283
Mafioso?

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.046
What about you?
What are you doing here?

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:10.323
- Here?
- Yes, in Rome.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:15.529
I'm here for the Alternative
Locomotion Energy Fair.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.210
Future means of transport.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:21.689
Ecological, clean vehicles
with low energy consumption.

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.167
Huh. Nice.

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:45.881
- What is it?
- It's called Aspasia.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.207
It's perfect
for getting around in the city.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.116
Maximum speed,
70 kilometres per hour. 40 miles.

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:55.040
It works like a bike. You pedal it.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.208
But if you need help
getting up a slope,

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.687
you can connect a silent,
compressed air motor,

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.643
and if it rains, you don't get wet.

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.888
Who invented this thing?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.990
Me.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.161
What?

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.430
What?

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.763
- Don't I look like an inventor?
- Actually, no.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.962
I am a mechanical engineer.

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:18.846
Came top in my year.

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.887
- It makes sense.
- Why?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.641
Because you are the best woman
I've ever met.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:32.164
Thanks, love.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:35.250
- Don't call me love.
- Why?

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:40.048
- Love is something else.
- It is also for me.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.731
That which I'm feeling right now
is very similar to love.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:45.446
Almost identical.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:49.969
Any love there might be here
right now is pure fantasy.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.321
Like anywhere else!

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.163
Now I know what you can give me as a present.

01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:09.890
It's not in your wedding list.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.642
I'm adding it now, and if you don't
get it for me, someone else will.

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:17.809
Ok, I'll leave it here.

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:21.208
It's in the fair, for whoever
wants to come and pick it up.

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:25.086
- Was it a success?
- Ha, you bet.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.646
I love it.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:32.163
I'm sure it won't be long
before they ban all cars from cities

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.408
and introduce your Aspasias.

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:37.723
At the moment,
this is the only prototype.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.320
One is enough for me in Moscow.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.887
Be sure that if you get
my Aspasia as a present,

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.411
it comes with me inside.

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.291
We are inseparable.

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:52.085
Even better.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.885
I also know who Aspasia was.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.683
She lived there in that painting.

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:15.046
As soon as I walked into this room
a week ago, I noticed the picture

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.890
and I thought that was
a good sign for my Aspasia.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.447
But just today I was told there is..

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:24.285
There is no chance
of it being manufactured.

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.410
So you went out and got drunk?

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:32.040
The truth is,

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.642
since last winter,
after what happened to the boy,

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.810
there is not one night I go
to bed without drinking.

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.002
It helps me sleep.

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:46.011
Except tonight, you woke me up.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.765
I should get going.

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:06.970
Can I have a shower first?

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:09.685
Yeah.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:28.881
I'm sorry, Vadim,
but I can never tell you about this.

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.761
Now I have a secret too.

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:38.520
But it's much further away
than yours.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:43.844
Maybe I missed
the sign in the painting.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.371
It's you, my little Russian.

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.648
The good thing I was expecting.

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:52.162
You'll always
have that... my reflection.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:56.925
This...

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.164
Is mine alone.

- I want to tell you something.
- Whatever you like.

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.846
Tonight before I met you,

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:44.201
my sister told me something at dinner

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:49.167
that deep down I imagined
but never had the courage to ask.

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:54.570
We had drunk a lot of wine
and we were having a very good time,

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:59.766
until she told me
that Vadim was with her before me.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:06.689
He was also my sister's teacher
but we were in different classes.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:09.201
When she got the part
we auditioned for

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:12.244
and stopped coming to the university,

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:17.207
he called her
and they were together for a while.

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:22.081
It was her who left him.

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:27.848
I imagine between them
they decided not to tell me anything,

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.566
until tonight my sister let it slip.

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:36.209
Don't tell anyone, but I like you
much more than your sister.

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:43.284
And white suits you much better.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.962
The guests are waiting.

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:59.803
My sister was thinking of inviting
several friends of her boyfriend.

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.445
Dodgy people.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:04.331
Actually, that was why we argued.

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:09.367
Well done.
We don't want mafiosos here.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.528
If anyone has anything to say,

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:17.531
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.404
Me.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.006
We are all listening, bride.

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:30.245
The weird thing is,
I'm worried about Vadim now.

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:33.887
In case my sister's boyfriend
finds out. He's an animal.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.526
And you? What about you?

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:39.369
Me?

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.801
I know Vadim is in love with me.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.368
I love the way you are.
You're such a good person.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:50.251
The best of all of us.

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:54.365
And I'm sure you're right,
Vadim loves you.

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:56.522
You above all.

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.688
Another strange thing.

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:07.044
Vadim has always reminded me
of someone from the Renaissance.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.527
One person in particular.

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:12.961
Who?

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:17.529
That guy,
the one speaking over your bed.

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:24.009
It's Leon Battista Alberti,
one of my favourite humanists.

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:27.442
Ha said that
you can't pull the string

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:30.524
without having a dartboard to aim at.

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:33.808
What does that mean?

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:40.371
The idea is that the artist must know
at all times what he's representing.

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:50.526
The picture shows a symposium
in the Medici Palace.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.640
I'm sure he was talking
about the Greeks.

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.808
He was fascinated by them.

01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:01.528
That painting speaks of the other.

01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:06.366
There are 20 centuries
between these two pictures.

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:09.000
In our case, only one room.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.002
We look like we're at a tennis match.

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.040
Conclusion.

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:12.687
Here beneath the city of my birth,
do you love me?

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:18.003
Well, I don't know why,

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.930
but right now...

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.125
yes, I am loving you.

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:29.601
With fantasies or without?

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.690
With both.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.849
I look good in white too, don't I?

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:48.447
A new day is coming.

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:52.047
Dawn is my moment.

01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:54.811
I'll stay
and watch the dawn with you

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.366
and then we say goodbye.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.048

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.003

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:01.441

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.887

- Yes, please.

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:08.682

- Thanks, Max.

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.889
Don't worry.

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:18.640
Can I hear your sister's voice?

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.889
<i>I hardly slept because of you.</i>

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.889

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.764

<i>Who is that?</i>

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.891
Room service.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.365
She brought breakfast.

01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:35.885
<i>You're having breakfast?</i>

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.765
Yes. I'm hungry.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.769
I'll see you at the hotel after.

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:46.764
Are you never going to tell her?

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:52.808
So, then, what's the plan?
Pass through here without a trace?

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:56.083
Without...
without ever telling anyone?

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:59.886
That's up to each of us.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.210
But there has to be something of us,
of both of us,

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:06.368
to remind us of this night.

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:08.761
Like what?

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:03.361
There is no wind yet. It's early.

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.207
When it blows,
they'll take the photo.

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:12.041
You'll see. They owe it to us.

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:17.246
What a beautiful thing
you've just said, little Russian.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:20.967
- Your idea was the best of all.
- We make a good team.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:28.042
But we can only be seen
from a satellite.

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:31.164
Oh, wow. You're inspired.

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:33.850
By you.

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.687
That deserves a kiss.

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:07.971
Max.
Maximo.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.162
Our breakfast.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:16.725
Hi.

01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:19.889
Good morning..
It certainly is.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.002
We're outside, on the terrace.

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:30.002
Today's the first day of summer.

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:33.809
There you go.

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:35.968
This time it was easy.

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:39.641
You wanted two large breakfasts
and here they are.

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.171
Thank you, Max.

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.329
What's that?

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:46.040
Well, now we have a best man.

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:49.528
Couldn't be better.

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.008
I think the daylight
will be good for us.

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.407
I'm sure. It usually is.

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:19.521
Hey, the sun looks
fantastic on your face.

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:23.770
In your eyes. On your lips.

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:28.169
Well, look at your skin.
The steppe is turning gold. Scary.

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:31.681
- I'm even more scared.
- Why?

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.447
Because I know
what I'm seeing and feeling.

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:47.004
Shall we play at being brave?

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:55.560
If we didn't have partners,
what would we do, you and me?

01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:59.571
I don't know. It's all so new to me.

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:03.729
- Shall we stay and live in Rome?
- I'm in love with Rome.

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:07.367
We'll stay and live in Rome, then.

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:12.003
Would you do it?
Would you leave Edurne and her kids?

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.964
Sorry. Her daughter.

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.082
To live with me here in Rome?

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:22.961
This is real, Natasha, not a fantasy.

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:27.842
I feel it with absolute clarity.

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:32.887
The gates are opening for us.
Can't you hear them?

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:37.760
Close your eyes.

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:47.447
If our hands meet in the middle of
the table, we enter together, deal?

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:50.331
Deal.
