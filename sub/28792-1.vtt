00:24.566 --> 00:26.652
<i>When I do the examination...</i>

00:27.694 --> 00:31.364
<i>I tell the parents that,
"You are the ones who are suffering</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:32.950
<i>because of her condition.</i>

00:35.661 --> 00:37.037
<i>She is not suffering.</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:42.918
<i>Your child is laying here like Snow White</i>

00:43.210 --> 00:46.629
<i>because everything
is so terrible around her</i>

00:46.630 --> 00:49.508
<i>that this is a way of protection.</i>

00:52.886 --> 00:57.641
<i>She is just waiting
for the situation to be better.</i>

01:00.018 --> 01:06.650
<i>And then she has a chance to wake up
and be a normal, lively person again."</i>

01:35.262 --> 01:38.023
We don't know how this happened.

01:38.307 --> 01:41.475
She was an athlete, went running,

01:41.476 --> 01:45.814
was active at school.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.609
We don't know how this happened.

02:03.582 --> 02:06.501
There, if you can just
put it on her stomach.

02:06.793 --> 02:07.793
Let's take a look.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.047
Put the whole thing there.

02:27.814 --> 02:28.899
Yes.

02:34.696 --> 02:40.576
No, this time the blood pressure
didn't change with ice on her stomach.

02:40.577 --> 02:45.207
It did when I examined her last time.

02:46.708 --> 02:50.044
So, she's a little more... unconscious.

02:50.045 --> 02:53.465
That's usually how it is
after lying down for a long time.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.049
Mm.

03:53.900 --> 03:57.487
<i>First it starts with... they don't talk.</i>

03:58.238 --> 04:00.073
<i>They just lie down.</i>

04:00.699 --> 04:03.910
<i>And then, they start to eat less and less.</i>

04:05.287 --> 04:09.249
<i>Then, they stop eating at all,
and they stop drinking.</i>

04:13.044 --> 04:16.798
<i>Most of the parents
don't know anything about this...</i>

04:17.716 --> 04:20.552
<i>so they think that the child could die.</i>

05:09.017 --> 05:11.268
My partners and I

05:11.269 --> 05:13.104
had a business,
providing internet service.

05:15.982 --> 05:19.820
People from the government
security services came...

05:20.904 --> 05:23.531
and asked me to shut down the internet.

05:23.532 --> 05:26.492
So that people in the region

05:26.493 --> 05:28.786
wouldn't have access to information,

05:28.787 --> 05:31.498
so nobody would know
what was happening in the capital.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.208
Yes.

05:35.794 --> 05:38.880
The next year...

05:40.590 --> 05:43.426
they started coming to us with threats.

05:43.885 --> 05:48.890
They reminded us
that we had not listened to them before

05:49.182 --> 05:50.892
and hadn't shut the internet down.

05:51.726 --> 05:52.726
And...

05:53.186 --> 05:58.650
we received threats
for nearly half a year.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.908
They took him away, took his documents.

06:12.414 --> 06:15.249
When I learned he was in the hospital,
I went to see him.

06:15.250 --> 06:20.505
He was under surveillance, but it wasn't
hard to get into the hospital.

06:22.007 --> 06:26.386
I just paid the guards to see him.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.683
He had been severely beaten.

06:31.933 --> 06:35.519
He had been tortured as well.

06:38.607 --> 06:41.109
Then we paid for a deal
that would let him escape.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.074
He was hiding for a while at first.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.075
Yes.

06:50.201 --> 06:54.873
And then he fled to Sweden.

07:01.004 --> 07:07.469
In the meantime,
I was shadowed and followed.

07:11.139 --> 07:16.727
One day, after taking
the children to school,

07:16.728 --> 07:20.357
I returned home,
and they were waiting for me at the door.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.655
His partner's wife and I

07:27.197 --> 07:28.865
were tortured and beaten.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.035
They took me into the woods...

07:32.953 --> 07:37.123
and then one of them raped me.

07:39.501 --> 07:43.630
They said if our husbands
didn't show up in 20 days...

07:44.589 --> 07:49.970
They would kill us all...
Our kids, our husbands, and us.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.434
We escaped to Sweden.

08:07.570 --> 08:13.617
'We have to look for the ghost, '
said Cesar.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.911
'Can you see anyone?' asked Cesar.

08:15.912 --> 08:21.001
Asta pressed her nose up
against the glass.

08:21.376 --> 08:24.170
'No ghost, ' she said.

08:24.921 --> 08:28.258
Asta went to help Cesar.

08:28.633 --> 08:34.806
They tugged at his legs,
but the ground was holding him."

08:40.145 --> 08:43.857
"Happy Birthday, Mo... Mona.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.525
Daria, seven years old."

08:49.529 --> 08:52.699
"Happy Birthday, Daria, seven years old.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.994
Alessan..."

08:56.244 --> 08:58.288
- Alessandro.
- "...dro."

09:22.145 --> 09:24.063
<i>Some children are aware</i>

09:24.064 --> 09:26.899
<i>that the asylum process is going on</i>

09:26.900 --> 09:29.903
<i>and the future is uncertain.</i>

09:30.403 --> 09:35.575
<i>And we know that a long period
of uncertainty after a trauma</i>

09:35.825 --> 09:36.993
<i>is very harmful.</i>

09:42.999 --> 09:48.713
<i>Security is really the basis
for rehabilitation after trauma.</i>

10:16.866 --> 10:19.118
We applied
for refugee status in Sweden.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.829
Refugee status, yes.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.751
We waited a year and a half.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.971
Then we were notified
that a decision had been made,

10:38.972 --> 10:40.348
and so we all went there.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.854
They started to announce the decision,

10:46.104 --> 10:49.149
stating the reasons why we had to escape.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.067
The whole story.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.738
The children did not know all of this.

10:57.699 --> 11:00.117
- We hadn't told them.
- We hadn't told them.

11:00.118 --> 11:03.662
We were keeping this from them.
So, they wouldn't know.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.831
The children started...

11:05.582 --> 11:09.335
The younger one started crying right away.

11:09.586 --> 11:14.674
They were able
to understand Swedish by then.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.719
They understood
before it was translated for us.

11:35.236 --> 11:40.325
Then the problems with Dasha began.

11:43.369 --> 11:45.569
Her teacher called me to come to school.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.832
She said my daughter was crying,

11:48.833 --> 11:51.836
saying she would be sent back and killed.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.296
All the kids in school were crying.

11:54.297 --> 11:56.549
The teacher didn't know what was going on.

12:12.815 --> 12:17.611
Soon she was rejecting food,

12:17.612 --> 12:19.739
and then she stopped responding
in general.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.430
<i>The children
with Resignation Syndrome,</i>

13:26.431 --> 13:30.893
<i>they started to turn up
around 2003, '04, '05.</i>

13:33.146 --> 13:35.480
<i>We were very surprised,</i>

13:35.481 --> 13:38.650
<i>because this really didn't look
like anything</i>

13:38.651 --> 13:40.987
<i>we had experienced before that.</i>

13:44.324 --> 13:46.909
<i>There were rumors at the time...</i>

13:47.285 --> 13:48.536
<i>Children are faking.</i>

13:49.203 --> 13:51.456
<i>They are just pretending to be sick,</i>

13:51.706 --> 13:54.751
<i>or parents were poisoning the children.</i>

13:55.209 --> 13:58.212
<i>And these were rumors
repeated by politicians.</i>

13:59.672 --> 14:04.302
<i>But it turned out that these rumors were
what we would call "fake news" today,</i>

14:04.844 --> 14:07.472
<i>propaganda from far-right activists.</i>

14:09.515 --> 14:12.810
<i>Every single test showed the same result.</i>

14:13.603 --> 14:16.397
<i>There was no
outside manipulation whatsoever.</i>

14:18.691 --> 14:24.030
<i>We're talking about children
who are really sick in a serious way.</i>

14:58.773 --> 15:01.149
He was a good student,

15:01.150 --> 15:03.569
very good at mathematics.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.446
Even the teachers
at his school in Sweden told us

15:06.447 --> 15:08.783
that Karen was very good at mathematics.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.997
He liked school very much.

17:40.101 --> 17:42.143
I was working in a restaurant,

17:42.144 --> 17:45.313
and on that day we had a lot of customers.

17:45.314 --> 17:49.526
Some of them were talking to each other,

17:49.527 --> 17:53.030
and I overheard them saying...

17:53.489 --> 17:56.117
that they had killed some people.

17:57.118 --> 18:02.789
Then we understood
that murders had been committed

18:02.790 --> 18:07.420
and that these were the people
who had been ordered to kill.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.603
On my way home,

18:23.853 --> 18:27.565
I had to pick up my son, Karen.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.775
I was with my friend,

18:30.443 --> 18:32.361
who was taking us home in his car.

18:34.572 --> 18:38.075
On the way, we were stopped.

18:43.164 --> 18:49.003
They cut our car off and stopped us.

18:52.089 --> 18:56.677
When my friend got out of the car,
they shot him.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.513
I got out of the car

19:00.514 --> 19:04.935
and managed to drag my son out,
and we ran away.

19:07.897 --> 19:11.192
By the time we got to Sweden,

19:11.692 --> 19:18.157
my son was under
a tremendous amount of stress.

19:18.866 --> 19:25.538
He was very upset and scared,

19:25.539 --> 19:30.503
constantly looking outside
and seeing things.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.633
<i>The children have seen a lot.</i>

20:18.175 --> 20:19.719
<i>And they come to Sweden,</i>

20:20.052 --> 20:23.389
<i>they go to school, they get friends,
they speak Swedish perfectly,</i>

20:24.056 --> 20:25.182
<i>and all of a sudden...</i>

20:26.016 --> 20:27.393
<i>you need to go back?</i>

20:29.061 --> 20:31.564
<i>And I don't think children
can manage that.</i>

21:02.887 --> 21:05.014
You want to see him swallow.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.100
Watch until he swallows.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.231
Don't hold him hard.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.526
- Mm-hmm.
- Just a finger, gently.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.196
He hasn't swallowed yet.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.739
Now he swallowed.

21:22.740 --> 21:26.118
Now you can take the next piece.
Let's keep going.

21:26.660 --> 21:32.041
Ice cream may not be the healthiest,
but it's something he can eat.

21:33.334 --> 21:34.585
Let's try again.

21:36.504 --> 21:39.507
Open his mouth. In goes the ice cream.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.092
There you go, close his mouth.

21:42.676 --> 21:45.846
It didn't end up behind his teeth.

21:46.138 --> 21:49.140
I don't think... There.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.310
No, too far forward.

21:53.187 --> 21:54.562
Let's see what he does.

21:54.563 --> 21:57.483
We'll wait and see.

22:10.412 --> 22:13.081
- There we go. Now he swallowed.
- Mm-hmm.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.916
You have to do this.

22:14.917 --> 22:18.294
You have to...
This is what you have to do.

22:18.295 --> 22:21.215
Hello! He's almost looking at me.

22:21.590 --> 22:22.716
Talk to your mom.

22:30.641 --> 22:34.144
Hi there.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.562
That's good.

22:35.563 --> 22:37.523
Not too much, not too long.

22:54.039 --> 22:56.332
It'll be okay.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.543
It's so hard.

22:58.544 --> 23:03.131
Yes, it's hard,
but you see it's working.

23:03.132 --> 23:04.592
You can tell it's working.

23:05.009 --> 23:06.009
Try.

23:06.635 --> 23:07.635
Hello.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.264
Hi there. Say it every day.

23:11.265 --> 23:15.644
Try to squeeze my hand, Karen.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.104
You speak to him.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.398
Try to squeeze my hand.

23:19.607 --> 23:22.818
Karen, my sweet child. My darling.

23:24.486 --> 23:25.529
My handsome boy.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.564
<i>The immigrants
that develop the condition</i>

24:01.565 --> 24:03.776
<i>seem to come
from certain parts of the world.</i>

24:04.068 --> 24:07.820
<i>They come from the Balkans,
and they come from former Soviet Republics</i>

24:07.821 --> 24:09.697
<i>on the southern border of Russia,</i>

24:09.698 --> 24:12.326
<i>or belong to certain ethnic minorities,</i>

24:12.785 --> 24:15.871
<i>which is rather difficult to explain.</i>

24:18.874 --> 24:23.754
<i>These children and their families have
almost exclusively been subject to trauma.</i>

24:24.171 --> 24:26.548
<i>Psychologically or physically, or both.</i>

24:28.509 --> 24:31.136
<i>And also, they are facing
the trauma of deportation.</i>

25:02.251 --> 25:05.212
<i>This family, they are Yazidis.</i>

25:06.422 --> 25:09.882
<i>And the Yazidis have been
second-class citizens</i>

25:09.883 --> 25:12.177
<i>in most countries where they live.</i>

25:15.431 --> 25:19.935
<i>They came from a small village
with about 30 households.</i>

25:21.729 --> 25:26.150
<i>This village had one well,
which was common for them all.</i>

25:27.109 --> 25:30.571
<i>So, every day,
the mother went to get water.</i>

25:32.531 --> 25:35.616
<i>One day when the mother
went to fetch water,</i>

25:35.617 --> 25:37.036
<i>four men came,</i>

25:37.286 --> 25:40.622
<i>and she was raped by all four of them.</i>

25:43.208 --> 25:47.879
<i>The mother's own father came
and very loudly said</i>

25:47.880 --> 25:50.049
<i>that he had to kill his daughter</i>

25:50.340 --> 25:54.803
<i>because she had made his name dishonored.</i>

26:01.226 --> 26:05.146
<i>Our children have not seen a good life.</i>

26:05.147 --> 26:08.776
<i>They go to school, but we do not know
how to survive in this country.</i>

26:11.320 --> 26:14.907
<i>It's all fear. The fear is in our bodies.</i>

26:28.629 --> 26:31.590
- Yes, let's try this.
- Mm-hmm.

26:32.758 --> 26:36.636
Let's see here.
Her blood pressure is normal.

26:36.637 --> 26:40.098
Her pulse is a little fast right now.

26:40.099 --> 26:44.394
I don't know if that's normal for her.

26:44.937 --> 26:48.774
I'll put this on her tummy
to make it cold.

26:49.483 --> 26:53.403
Then we can see if her blood pressure
and pulse respond.

26:53.821 --> 26:58.324
One-hundred and nine over 68, pulse is 96.

26:58.325 --> 27:00.077
I'm going to note this.

27:00.786 --> 27:01.787
Let's check.

27:02.246 --> 27:04.163
Let's remeasure it.

27:05.457 --> 27:10.671
I think if I put it on your belly,
your blood pressure would just spike.

27:22.808 --> 27:25.393
- Is her heart beating fast?
- Sorry?

27:25.394 --> 27:26.769
Is it beating fast?

27:26.770 --> 27:28.396
Yes, it's beating fast.

27:28.397 --> 27:32.109
But it's not so unusual.

27:32.526 --> 27:35.236
- It's not good, right?
- Yes, it's good,

27:35.237 --> 27:38.906
because it means she's reacting
a little bit to what we're doing.

27:38.907 --> 27:41.909
Her pulse isn't high all the time.

27:41.910 --> 27:44.203
I think it's because I'm here.

27:44.204 --> 27:48.292
- Is it a problem?
- No. Don't be worried.

27:48.458 --> 27:52.086
And this is unchanged.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.630
So she was actually
not reacting to this at all.

27:54.631 --> 27:56.549
She wasn't affected by it.

27:56.550 --> 27:59.136
There you go.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.911
I want my sister to get well.

28:24.912 --> 28:26.746
I have these toy gods.

28:26.747 --> 28:30.041
I always wake up and talk to the toy gods.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.002
I wake up and say,

28:32.461 --> 28:34.962
"Please make my sister better

28:34.963 --> 28:37.506
so we can go to school together
like before."

28:58.153 --> 29:01.530
<i>My children are used to living here.</i>

29:01.531 --> 29:03.116
<i>Sweden is a great country for them.</i>

29:05.994 --> 29:09.081
<i>I just want my children to survive here.</i>

29:45.492 --> 29:47.785
<i>We don't have
any good explanation</i>

29:47.786 --> 29:49.662
<i>why there are more children</i>

29:49.663 --> 29:52.833
<i>with this kind of reaction in Sweden</i>

29:53.292 --> 29:54.710
<i>compared to other countries.</i>

29:55.877 --> 29:59.881
<i>We know of similar cases
in other countries,</i>

30:00.424 --> 30:01.842
<i>but not so many.</i>

30:02.426 --> 30:06.847
<i>So far we don't have any good explanation
about why that's the case.</i>

30:10.600 --> 30:13.602
<i>Cultural factors
that are perhaps exclusive to Sweden</i>

30:13.603 --> 30:15.938
<i>may be important
in developing this condition.</i>

30:15.939 --> 30:20.901
<i>And one such factor may be the insecurity
that these families are subjected to</i>

30:20.902 --> 30:23.155
<i>as they are going through
the asylum process.</i>

30:24.740 --> 30:28.117
<i>There are very many under-researched areas</i>

30:28.118 --> 30:29.578
<i>pertaining to this condition.</i>

31:10.744 --> 31:13.746
Last week they called us,

31:13.747 --> 31:19.211
identified themselves, and said
that a decision had been made in our case.

31:19.669 --> 31:22.964
They said we'd been granted
residency in Sweden.

31:25.175 --> 31:30.222
A few days later,
we received a letter in the mail.

31:30.472 --> 31:33.100
- In the mail.
- In the mail...

31:35.644 --> 31:40.232
- Confirming that we really did get it.
- That we got it.

31:52.869 --> 31:59.668
<i>Recovery comes
mostly after the family feels secure.</i>

32:01.753 --> 32:04.423
<i>It doesn't come immediately.</i>

32:05.924 --> 32:08.426
<i>Usually, it takes several months</i>

32:08.427 --> 32:11.388
<i>before you can see
that it's getting better.</i>

32:18.353 --> 32:20.021
We read the decision to Dasha,

32:20.230 --> 32:23.024
told her everything was going to be good.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.277
That everything will be okay,

32:25.735 --> 32:28.447
and that no one would kick us out now.

32:36.121 --> 32:38.831
<i>The recovery
of these children is dependent</i>

32:38.832 --> 32:40.625
<i>on rebuilding hope.</i>

32:41.334 --> 32:44.628
<i>And it seems that the parents
are the persons</i>

32:44.629 --> 32:46.381
<i>that are transmitting this hope.</i>

32:46.715 --> 32:49.968
<i>So it must be
some kind of communication...</i>

32:50.594 --> 32:51.594
<i>the tone,</i>

32:52.012 --> 32:53.138
<i>the touch,</i>

32:53.597 --> 32:55.348
<i>the atmosphere in the room...</i>

32:55.682 --> 33:00.228
<i>where the children can feel
that their parents are more hopeful.</i>

33:00.395 --> 33:02.898
Such long hair.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.985
Like Rapunzel's, beautiful.

33:07.777 --> 33:09.779
All the way down your back.

34:25.146 --> 34:28.525
<i>I'm now working full-time.</i>

34:29.109 --> 34:34.155
<i>I'm very happy about that,
and I want to continue working.</i>

35:09.274 --> 35:13.903
<i>The condition
of the young Yazidi girl remains the same.</i>

35:15.822 --> 35:20.909
<i>But now, her older sister is also
showing signs of Resignation Syndrome.</i>

35:28.460 --> 35:32.172
<i>I visited the family
on the mother's birthday.</i>

35:34.049 --> 35:38.470
<i>She told me that on her last birthday,
a year ago,</i>

35:38.887 --> 35:42.766
<i>both her daughters
gave her flowers and kissed her.</i>

35:44.309 --> 35:46.895
<i>And now, neither of them can do that.</i>

36:25.642 --> 36:28.686
<i>Daria keeps getting better.</i>

36:28.687 --> 36:29.979
<i>She's back at school.</i>

36:33.900 --> 36:36.403
<i>She doesn't remember what happened to her.</i>

36:39.155 --> 36:43.743
<i>When she asks, "Mom, was I sleeping?"</i>

36:46.079 --> 36:51.126
<i>I tell her, "Yes, you were
a sleeping princess.</i>

36:53.420 --> 36:56.589
<i>But now you are awake,
and everything will be fine."</i>

37:20.321 --> 37:24.576
<i>It's important to say
that Sweden has admitted</i>

37:24.868 --> 37:27.078
<i>large numbers of refugees</i>

37:27.454 --> 37:28.454
<i>for many years.</i>

37:31.541 --> 37:35.837
<i>We come from a society
that opens its doors.</i>
