WEBVTT

00:33.041 --> 00:35.458
Whoa. Nice little place.

00:40.125 --> 00:41.041
Mary Jayne.

00:43.416 --> 00:44.958
Mary Jayne? Wake up.

00:45.541 --> 00:47.208
They made it. They're here.

00:47.916 --> 00:48.916
Oh.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.458
Are you coming with me?

00:50.458 --> 00:53.500
It's better for them not to see me.
It'll be fine.

00:54.583 --> 00:55.583
Good luck.

01:00.291 --> 01:03.208
We have, uh,
six Lee-Enfield revolvers,

01:03.208 --> 01:07.333
six .303 rifles,
300 rounds of ammunition for each.

01:07.333 --> 01:11.083
Assorted grenades,
plastic explosives, and detonators.

01:11.708 --> 01:14.125
I don't know
what we'll do with all that, but...

01:14.125 --> 01:17.958
- Long, tough fight ahead, ma'am.
Oh, well, merry Christmas.

01:17.958 --> 01:21.083
<i>Happy</i> Christmas.
Seven weeks to go, isn't it?

01:21.083 --> 01:23.416
- Well, you'll be home by then.
- Think so?

01:24.000 --> 01:27.125
If only Father Christmas would bring me
a Dakota to fly us the hell out of here.

01:27.125 --> 01:31.583
- Oh. I had a Vega Gull for a while.
- Where's your plane when you need it?

01:31.583 --> 01:33.958
I had to sell it to raise money
for this operation.

01:34.625 --> 01:35.708
Huh.

01:35.708 --> 01:41.250
Okay, so you will take the train
to Banyuls-sur-Mer.

01:41.250 --> 01:44.166
Like I said, this is
the safe route through the Pyrenees.

01:44.166 --> 01:46.833
And once you are here, you're in Spain.

01:46.833 --> 01:49.166
Here are your new passports

01:49.166 --> 01:52.208
and your change of clothes.

01:52.958 --> 01:55.250
- You'll be dressed as vineyard workers.

01:55.250 --> 01:58.541
- Okay.
- Uh, all right, men, moving out.

01:59.875 --> 02:01.375
- Thanks.
- And, Ms. Gold...

02:02.125 --> 02:05.083
Thank you so much!
Thank you.

02:06.541 --> 02:08.166
<i>This is Europe.</i>

02:08.166 --> 02:09.541
<i>As the Nazis continue</i>

02:09.541 --> 02:12.333
<i>their unencumbered march
across the continent,</i>

02:12.333 --> 02:14.875
<i>Americans march to the polls.</i>

02:15.375 --> 02:18.916
<i>If reelected for
an unprecedented third term in office,</i>

02:18.916 --> 02:21.958
<i>President Roosevelt
promises to stay neutral,</i>

02:22.750 --> 02:25.291
<i>but Republican candidate
Wendell Willkie insists</i>

02:25.291 --> 02:30.125
<i>his opponent is secretly planning
to take the United States to war.</i>

02:45.458 --> 02:48.625
Commissioner.
Welcome, Gruppenführer.

02:51.041 --> 02:52.916
The city's at your feet.

02:52.916 --> 02:54.875
Very good.

02:55.625 --> 02:57.000
Streets are very clean.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.833
No trouble. No protests.

02:59.833 --> 03:02.416
We have removed all rogue elements. Clean.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.250
Very good.

03:04.833 --> 03:07.291
Please enjoy Marseille.
I will see you tonight.

03:20.458 --> 03:21.458
Good morning.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.875
Sorry. Couldn't resist.

03:32.208 --> 03:33.708
- Oh.

03:33.708 --> 03:36.916
I drank a lot worse in Soviet prisons.

03:36.916 --> 03:40.208
We have to get Walter Mehring
out of here. This man is driving me nuts.

03:40.208 --> 03:43.666
He's keeping me up performing
his full repertoire over and over.

03:43.666 --> 03:44.708
His lyrics are funny.

03:44.708 --> 03:47.000
How many times
can you listen to the Nazi marching tune?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.458
He pissed off the Nazis so much,
Goebbels wants him dead.

03:49.458 --> 03:52.666
Well, all the more reason
to get him out of this house

03:52.666 --> 03:54.625
and over to Broadway as soon as possible.

03:55.916 --> 03:56.750
Poor guy.

03:58.083 --> 04:02.458
- Can't be easy with a target on your back.
- We all have targets on our backs.

04:03.041 --> 04:05.416
The Nazis take themselves too seriously.

04:05.958 --> 04:07.125
Do you think so?

04:07.125 --> 04:09.791
I can't take Mehring to the office.
He'll just perform.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.583
Will you take him
down to the Pelican, please?

04:12.583 --> 04:15.416
I'll have Bill Freier meet you there
with Mehring's passport.

04:17.375 --> 04:18.958
I can't. Gentlemen...

04:19.958 --> 04:21.125
Have a nice day.

04:48.291 --> 04:49.250
Gentlemen.

04:49.750 --> 04:50.916
Hi.

04:50.916 --> 04:53.666
- You're up early.
- Wanted to see the sunrise.

04:54.583 --> 04:56.166
- Sure you did.

05:14.291 --> 05:15.625
Entertaining?

05:15.625 --> 05:18.625
- Yes, and I need a lot of fuel.
- Oh!

05:18.625 --> 05:22.458
<i>♪ Comrades, take a look inside his pants ♪</i>

05:27.583 --> 05:28.750
Thanks.
- Mm.

05:29.250 --> 05:30.291
How'd it go?

05:30.291 --> 05:32.541
I drew them a map.
I hope they can read it.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.458
They're soldiers. They'll make it across.

05:36.250 --> 05:37.250
You did well.

05:37.916 --> 05:38.916
Thanks.

05:40.583 --> 05:44.208
If Varian ever finds out about this,
he'll kill me, and then he'll kill you.

05:44.208 --> 05:45.625
Varian won't find out.

05:48.125 --> 05:50.375
And if he did,
he'll know we're doing the right thing.

05:50.375 --> 05:51.916
Are you sure about that?

05:52.791 --> 05:53.791
Of course.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.291
Morning. Good morning.

06:06.916 --> 06:08.041
Good morning.

06:09.166 --> 06:11.416
Thank you.
We'll be with you as soon as we can.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.750
- Good morning.
- Hi.

06:17.625 --> 06:19.500
I've got some good news for a change.

06:19.500 --> 06:20.583
Oh.

06:20.583 --> 06:21.708
I need coffee.

06:22.666 --> 06:24.083
Real coffee, please.

06:29.041 --> 06:30.375
What is the good news?

06:30.875 --> 06:35.000
Freier finished Mehring's passport.
His work is actually getting really good.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.291
Oh, this is excellent.

06:36.291 --> 06:39.166
Would you have him meet
Albert and Mehring down at the Pelican?

06:39.166 --> 06:40.083
Yes.

06:43.708 --> 06:45.958
We grab your passport
and get you on the train.

06:45.958 --> 06:48.958
By this time tomorrow,
you'll be eating breakfast in Spain.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.541
Come on!
Men...

06:52.541 --> 06:54.833
- Let me settle my bill first.

06:54.833 --> 06:56.000
I am paying.

06:59.166 --> 07:00.333
Thank you.

07:00.333 --> 07:01.958
Come. Come with us.

07:03.625 --> 07:04.458
Coming.

07:28.583 --> 07:30.166
Police! Stop!

07:32.333 --> 07:36.250
Police! Stop!

07:36.250 --> 07:37.958
Police! Don't move!

07:39.125 --> 07:41.625
- Mr. Fry, you are under arrest.
- Follow us!

07:41.625 --> 07:42.666
Just one minute!

07:47.750 --> 07:49.333
What's all this about?

07:49.333 --> 07:50.625
It's not about anything.

07:50.625 --> 07:52.625
- That's how fascism works.
- Sh!

07:56.250 --> 07:57.333
Oh.

07:57.333 --> 07:58.791
Make a note.

08:05.958 --> 08:07.666
Very clever.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.625
Everybody in the car. Right now.

08:10.625 --> 08:12.958
- Women and children stay here.
Let's go.

08:13.458 --> 08:15.416
You can't separate us.
We're a family!

08:15.416 --> 08:17.125
It's going to be okay.

08:18.083 --> 08:19.291
Everybody, go!

08:19.291 --> 08:20.916
Come on, move it!

08:26.583 --> 08:28.500
- And where is the small dog?
- The dog?

08:28.500 --> 08:29.666
The dog.

08:30.833 --> 08:32.583
Go!
You come with us.

08:33.291 --> 08:34.625
Go!

08:42.083 --> 08:44.041
Keep moving!
Don't stop.

08:44.041 --> 08:46.750
Why come for us now?
Cracking down.

08:46.750 --> 08:47.916
But why now?

08:58.833 --> 09:01.250
Varian.
- They came to the villa too?

09:01.250 --> 09:03.166
They searched the whole house.

09:04.041 --> 09:05.250
It's ridiculous.

09:11.666 --> 09:12.750
Keep going.

09:13.666 --> 09:17.291
<i>We'll be looking
for signs of whether Roosevelt's New Deal</i>

09:17.291 --> 09:19.916
<i>has broken through Republican defenses...</i>

09:19.916 --> 09:22.875
There's nothing new
about a seven-year-old deal!

09:23.583 --> 09:25.291
- When's this election over?
Tonight.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.500
What is it?

09:28.500 --> 09:31.125
- We have a meeting now with a...
- Doog Nuggent.

09:31.125 --> 09:33.166
Doug Nugent, American Computing Machines.

09:33.166 --> 09:35.041
Looking for us to make introductions.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.625
Excellent.
If the Republicans can pull this off,

09:37.625 --> 09:39.875
ACM is exactly
the kind of American company

09:39.875 --> 09:41.375
with a big future in Europe.

09:45.666 --> 09:48.291
A future ambassador needs
friends in the right places.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.958
A gift from ACM.

09:57.958 --> 09:59.625
Electrical typewriters.

09:59.625 --> 10:00.916
First of their kind.

10:01.583 --> 10:05.166
I have two US English keyboards
and one French.

10:05.166 --> 10:08.500
I mean, we can even supply
German-language keyboards,

10:08.500 --> 10:11.708
if you think it might be, um... necessary.

10:11.708 --> 10:14.250
Just switch out
these keys here for an umlaut

10:14.250 --> 10:17.166
and that funky B that sounds like an S.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.916
And I've also brought you this,

10:19.916 --> 10:23.166
which I thought you might find
particularly useful tonight

10:23.166 --> 10:24.666
when the results come in.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.791
- Ta-da!

10:27.791 --> 10:30.666
This is how you can track
the electoral college.

10:30.666 --> 10:32.083
What's an electoral college?

10:32.083 --> 10:33.500
Uh, I would explain it to you,

10:33.500 --> 10:36.333
but you'll never understand it
because it doesn't make sense.

10:36.333 --> 10:37.916
Donkeys versus elephants.

10:37.916 --> 10:39.791
And who do we want to win?

10:39.791 --> 10:41.708
Elephants!
Donkeys.

10:41.708 --> 10:44.916
We have a strong two-term tradition
in our country, young man.

10:44.916 --> 10:47.000
We believe in fresh starts.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.166
Now, let's see where tonight brings us,
but I can already tell you

10:50.166 --> 10:54.708
that Willkie is
the front-runner in these four states.

10:57.666 --> 11:00.541
American business is not comfortable
with Roosevelt's attempt

11:00.541 --> 11:03.083
to turn the United States
into a dictatorship.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.416
I have one final gift.

11:06.208 --> 11:08.208
This one is a local product.

11:09.250 --> 11:12.416
A 1916 vintage?
This must've cost a fortune.

11:12.416 --> 11:14.625
Open it when Willkie wins, you know?

11:15.375 --> 11:19.708
Did you know that you are working for
the next US ambassador to France?

11:20.833 --> 11:22.833
We don't know that for sure.

11:22.833 --> 11:25.875
- Uh, Doug, I can't accept this.
- You can and you will.

11:26.625 --> 11:29.958
ACM is keen to take care
of the new decision makers in Europe.

11:31.250 --> 11:32.458
Well, much obliged.

11:43.416 --> 11:46.166
- This is Walter Mehring.
- What's going on out there?

11:46.166 --> 11:49.333
It's a coordinated operation.
Arrests are being made all over town.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.125
Okay. <i>The</i> Walter Mehring.

11:53.583 --> 11:54.583
Oh.

11:59.833 --> 12:01.500
400,000-FRANC REWARD WANTED

12:01.500 --> 12:03.416
These posters are everywhere.

12:08.541 --> 12:09.583
Oh my God.

12:11.166 --> 12:12.916
Get him into a room upstairs.

12:16.583 --> 12:20.250
Arresting innocent people
in Marseille? Not a good sign.

12:29.875 --> 12:30.833
Come.

12:31.791 --> 12:32.666
Good?

12:33.166 --> 12:35.833
Albert, you know
I'm not a big fan of being alone!

12:35.833 --> 12:38.166
You're not alone.
I'll be back to check in on you!

12:39.500 --> 12:40.541
Good. Bring wine!

12:42.291 --> 12:44.791
I will see what I can do.
Lock the door behind me!

12:44.791 --> 12:46.375
Mehring. Lock the door!

12:57.791 --> 13:00.083
Mehring's in his room.
Thank you for that.

13:00.750 --> 13:02.833
He can't stay up there long.
He's got a train to catch.

13:02.833 --> 13:05.083
Lisa's planning to take him
over the Pyrenees tonight.

13:19.375 --> 13:22.166
We booked five rooms
under the name Schrader.

13:51.625 --> 13:53.833
They're clearly planning something.

13:57.583 --> 14:00.541
If you're going back upstairs,
you need a disguise.

14:03.291 --> 14:05.083
Let's change clothes. Come on.

14:09.541 --> 14:11.833
Where are you going?
- Outside.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.333
Stay here.

14:15.541 --> 14:17.958
Cover for me.
I need to know what's going on.

14:19.958 --> 14:20.958
Be careful.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.416
We need to find
someone who can tell us what's going on.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.416
Shit.

14:39.708 --> 14:43.375
You know what's strange?
I think I've been on this boat before.

14:43.875 --> 14:44.750
What?

14:45.750 --> 14:47.833
Name rings a bell for sure.

14:47.833 --> 14:49.250
The SS Sinaia.

14:50.750 --> 14:51.708
Oh my--

14:51.708 --> 14:53.541
I'm so sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me.

14:55.208 --> 14:58.333
- This is because of us. It has to be.
- That doesn't make sense.

14:58.333 --> 14:59.416
Mary Jayne.

15:00.083 --> 15:01.000
Sorry.

15:01.000 --> 15:01.916
Thomas.

15:02.416 --> 15:04.000
Fancy seeing you here.

15:06.625 --> 15:07.583
You all right?

15:07.583 --> 15:09.125
- Not really.
- We're fine.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.333
Where's Lena?

15:11.333 --> 15:14.791
Well, they raided the whole office,
but they only took me.

15:15.500 --> 15:19.416
So none of this makes sense.
Arresting American citizens. Why?

15:20.000 --> 15:24.083
Vichy has been so careful
about staying in America's good graces.

15:24.750 --> 15:28.916
- Maybe Madame Nouget reported us.
- Madame Nouget would never do that.

15:28.916 --> 15:32.125
- We're harboring fugitives in the villa.
- Impossible.

15:32.625 --> 15:34.875
Well, all of our behavior
is not exactly legal.

15:34.875 --> 15:36.041
What behavior?

15:36.041 --> 15:40.333
The... fake passports
and the black market currency exchange.

15:40.916 --> 15:43.375
You're always telling me
I'm not doing enough.

15:43.375 --> 15:46.250
- And now I'm doing too much?
- We all do the best we can.

15:46.750 --> 15:47.916
Do we, now?

15:54.666 --> 15:55.666
I'm sorry.

15:55.666 --> 15:58.875
Could one of you please explain to me
why you both look so guilty?

16:00.500 --> 16:01.750
Well, okay.

16:02.875 --> 16:04.041
I have to tell him.

16:05.041 --> 16:07.041
We've been working
with British intelligence.

16:08.375 --> 16:09.708
British intelligence?

16:10.416 --> 16:13.958
The first group of POWs is
going over the F-route tonight.

16:19.166 --> 16:23.625
The-- That woman that came up to me
in the hotel lobby, she work for you?

16:24.875 --> 16:26.125
We work for her.

16:28.833 --> 16:31.416
But Mary Jayne's only been doing this
to keep the ERC afloat.

16:31.416 --> 16:32.541
Oh!

16:33.000 --> 16:34.083
We need money.

16:34.083 --> 16:36.458
- What happened to your trust fund?
- We're on the same side.

16:36.458 --> 16:37.500
It's not that simple.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.916
There's more at stake
than our personal relationship.

16:43.208 --> 16:45.625
You have put the entire ERC in jeopardy.

16:46.916 --> 16:51.083
An American working in the interest
of foreign intelligence abroad.

16:51.083 --> 16:52.291
That is not a joke.

16:53.041 --> 16:53.875
That's treason.

16:53.875 --> 16:55.208
They're not gonna kill me

16:55.208 --> 16:57.666
because I helped some of our allies
escape from a war zone.

16:57.666 --> 17:01.875
No? Treason is punishable by death
in the United States, Mary Jayne.

17:01.875 --> 17:03.666
- Understand?
- It won't get there.

17:03.666 --> 17:05.333
How the hell do you know?

17:06.916 --> 17:09.916
This is ridiculous.
No wonder we've been arrested.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.750
Mehring, it's me. Open up!

17:40.666 --> 17:45.000
Albert, I saw Wehrmacht in the corridor.
Are they after me? Do they know I'm here?

17:45.000 --> 17:45.916
No.

17:47.708 --> 17:48.875
Ah. Thank you!

17:49.833 --> 17:51.083
- Walter...

17:52.250 --> 17:53.083
Listen.

17:53.083 --> 17:54.083
Yes.

17:54.083 --> 17:57.250
We can't risk leaving here right now.
Do you understand?

17:57.250 --> 17:58.833
You are going to miss your train.

17:59.333 --> 18:01.583
- Excuse me?
I know you are scared.

18:02.083 --> 18:04.708
I'll figure out a way to get you out.
But you're safe here.

18:05.666 --> 18:06.500
But...

18:07.333 --> 18:08.500
Just be patient.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.750
Patient? I'm surrounded by Nazis!

18:11.500 --> 18:14.791
Then keep the door locked
and only open it when you hear my voice.

18:15.291 --> 18:16.125
Understood?

18:16.750 --> 18:17.583
Yes.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.416
Young man!

18:26.125 --> 18:27.208
I need service.

18:28.583 --> 18:30.000
I need service.

18:31.500 --> 18:35.000
Yes. Of course. How can I help you?

18:35.625 --> 18:36.916
Steam and press.

18:36.916 --> 18:41.000
Creases sharp in all the right places.
Got that?

18:41.583 --> 18:42.416
Yes.

18:53.083 --> 18:55.083
<i>- Merci beaucoup.</i>
<i>Merci.</i>

18:55.833 --> 18:57.083
Steam and press.

18:57.875 --> 18:58.833
Are you okay?

19:02.916 --> 19:04.666
A real Nazi. In the flesh.

19:07.875 --> 19:11.250
You've never come face-to-face
with your oppressor before, have you?

19:12.750 --> 19:13.583
No.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.291
Not like this.

19:18.166 --> 19:20.125
For me, that happens every day.

19:20.125 --> 19:23.500
It's easy to see who is who.
The French are white. We are Black.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.416
We eat their food, learn their language.

19:25.416 --> 19:29.125
The Nazis are exporting across Europe
what we experienced in the colonies.

19:29.125 --> 19:31.291
The fear, the violence,

19:31.291 --> 19:34.333
the sense you are less human
for daring to have your own culture.

19:38.125 --> 19:41.250
It's crazy out there.
The police are clearing the streets.

19:41.250 --> 19:43.125
- But why?
For the Nazi takeover.

19:43.833 --> 19:47.250
Schrader ordered the dining room closed
for dinner with the chief of police.

19:47.250 --> 19:48.416
Here in the hotel?

19:51.166 --> 19:53.000
- This is my chance.
- Chance for what?

19:53.000 --> 19:56.375
To kill him.
I need a knife, a letter opener, anything.

19:58.166 --> 19:59.000
Easy! Easy!

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
Paul, I have spent the last seven years
of my life running.

20:03.083 --> 20:04.708
Yes, I'm helping here, and I know that,

20:04.708 --> 20:07.333
but I'm helping other people
as everybody's running away.

20:08.083 --> 20:11.791
So the least that I can do,
if I'm gonna die anyway,

20:11.791 --> 20:12.875
is to take

20:13.833 --> 20:15.416
one of those bastards with me.

20:15.416 --> 20:16.916
Okay. Okay.

20:16.916 --> 20:17.958
Okay.

20:17.958 --> 20:20.791
At least let's make a plan
to get Mehring out of here first.

Put this on.

21:55.125 --> 21:56.208
Are you drunk?

21:56.208 --> 21:57.125
No.

21:58.083 --> 21:58.958
Mm.

21:58.958 --> 22:00.041
Now I am.

22:01.625 --> 22:02.458
Let's go.

22:08.291 --> 22:09.500
Hurry up.

22:14.541 --> 22:15.375
Uh...

22:15.875 --> 22:17.125
Commissaire Frot?

22:18.916 --> 22:20.583
To what do I owe
this pleasure?

22:20.583 --> 22:23.083
I found your American friends.

22:24.458 --> 22:27.875
- Who?
- Who? Varian Fry and Mary Jayne Gold.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.875
- They're not my friends.
- Yes. But they have been arrested.

22:34.625 --> 22:36.041
On what grounds?

22:36.833 --> 22:42.916
Maréchal Petain is visiting Marseille
today with his, uh, Nazi colleagues,

22:42.916 --> 22:46.000
so we cleared the city for a parade.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.541
You arrested American citizens
because of a parade?

22:50.708 --> 22:53.041
It was a question of national security.

22:54.166 --> 22:56.666
What do the Americans
have to do with that?

22:59.083 --> 23:04.375
I am not at liberty
to comment on ongoing investigations, but...

23:08.625 --> 23:11.791
But, uh, you should know, Mr. Patterson,

23:11.791 --> 23:16.958
that we've had them both
under observation in recent days.

23:31.625 --> 23:32.625
Since when?

23:36.625 --> 23:37.791
Where are you holding them?

23:39.208 --> 23:40.125
On a ship.

23:40.125 --> 23:41.375
Down at the docks.

23:42.583 --> 23:43.666
The SS Sinaia.

23:46.250 --> 23:50.333
I just wanted to deliver the news to you
in person,

23:51.375 --> 23:52.291
given your...

23:52.958 --> 23:57.291
your private relationship
with... with Ms. Gold.

24:14.750 --> 24:15.583
Albert...

24:16.083 --> 24:18.666
I'm missing the hat!
They'll know I'm an imposter!

24:18.666 --> 24:20.583
Shit. We have to go back to the hotel.

24:20.583 --> 24:21.791
No, absolutely not.

24:24.166 --> 24:25.000
Come on.

24:30.583 --> 24:31.500
You stay here.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.666
Has everyone here been arrested?

24:46.250 --> 24:47.083
I do not know.

24:52.583 --> 24:53.416
Um...

24:55.291 --> 24:57.958
Whatever you're looking for,
sir, you won't find it here.

24:57.958 --> 24:59.458
This is not what it looks like.

24:59.458 --> 25:01.250
- Stand back!
He's not a Nazi.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.208
It's a disguise.

25:02.208 --> 25:06.541
- I am Walter Mehring.
- He's Goebbels' public enemy number one.

25:07.291 --> 25:08.875
What did you do to him?

25:08.875 --> 25:10.833
Well, I... I write, I sing.

25:12.791 --> 25:14.000
Everyone's a critic.

25:24.791 --> 25:27.291
I've seen your face on the poster.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.041
We need somewhere to hide.

25:32.041 --> 25:35.416
Well, it's not safe.
We all have to go.

25:40.208 --> 25:41.541
You must eat.

25:44.375 --> 25:48.875
The secret of survival is
to think like a soldier.

25:48.875 --> 25:52.208
You eat when you can,
and you rest when you can.

25:55.041 --> 25:57.458
- There you are. Varian Fry.

25:57.458 --> 25:59.833
What is going on?
Why have we been arrested?

25:59.833 --> 26:02.916
- I'm here to make sure you're still alive.
- Well, get us out.

26:03.500 --> 26:04.375
It's not up to me.

26:05.166 --> 26:07.083
Take a message to the captain of the ship.

26:07.083 --> 26:10.833
Ask him if he remembers
the Berlin Defense of 1930,

26:10.833 --> 26:12.833
and if so, would he like a rematch?

26:13.583 --> 26:15.416
- What?
- Just ask him, please.

26:16.125 --> 26:19.750
I'm just here
to check on innocent American citizens

26:19.750 --> 26:22.791
inadvertently caught up
in this morning's police action.

26:23.791 --> 26:25.333
The police know about us.

26:26.166 --> 26:28.250
What are you talking about?
There is no "us."

26:28.250 --> 26:29.583
It ends now.

26:31.166 --> 26:32.166
Is this a joke?

26:33.125 --> 26:35.458
Unless you're here to help me, get out.

26:35.458 --> 26:38.291
You must never speak of me
to anyone again.

26:38.291 --> 26:40.083
- Okay?
Are you kidding me?

26:40.083 --> 26:42.708
I'm never gonna <i>think</i> about you
if I can help it.

26:45.791 --> 26:46.708
Ask him.

26:52.625 --> 26:56.541
We sent all our congregants home
immediately when we heard about the raids.

26:56.541 --> 26:59.166
But I thought
the police weren't targeting French Jews.

26:59.166 --> 27:01.625
Ah, they weren't. Until they were.

27:01.625 --> 27:03.083
Here. Put this on.

27:03.083 --> 27:06.625
It was just a matter of time.
All right.

27:08.958 --> 27:10.458
Are they taking Marseille?

27:10.458 --> 27:12.875
I don't know.
- We need to save the Judaica.

27:14.666 --> 27:17.458
The only way out of here
without calling attention to ourselves

27:17.458 --> 27:19.125
is to blend in.

27:19.125 --> 27:21.333
That's why the rabbi and I
shaved our beards.

27:21.333 --> 27:22.250
Come.

27:46.333 --> 27:49.333
The bus stop is at the end of the street.
We'll take him there.

27:49.333 --> 27:50.250
Thank you.

27:51.041 --> 27:51.916
Goodbye.

27:51.916 --> 27:54.500
Follow the rabbi.
That bus will take you to the villa.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.041
Stay there.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.541
You will be safe.

27:57.541 --> 27:58.500
Go!

28:07.375 --> 28:09.625
Mr. Fry, we meet again.

28:10.541 --> 28:13.750
The man who checkmated me
three times in a row.

28:14.250 --> 28:15.375
Capt. Dubois.

28:16.583 --> 28:19.291
I assume you're not in Europe
as a tourist this time.

28:19.291 --> 28:22.666
How did you and your boat
get involved in this little stunt?

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Not by choice.

28:26.041 --> 28:30.250
I remember you as a man of honor.
Captain, may I speak freely?

28:31.375 --> 28:33.083
Over a rematch.

28:36.041 --> 28:39.333
We're getting about eight to ten people
out a week over the Pyrenees.

28:40.125 --> 28:42.791
It's steady, but it's inadequate.

28:44.416 --> 28:45.500
Who's "we"?

28:46.125 --> 28:48.250
There was a small group of us in New York.

28:48.916 --> 28:51.958
Put together a committee
with some important German émigrés.

28:51.958 --> 28:54.041
Thomas Mann, Theodor Adorno.

28:56.291 --> 28:59.250
They wanted to rescue
some of their friends, their colleagues,

28:59.250 --> 29:02.791
the greatest thinkers
and artists in the world.

29:04.791 --> 29:09.083
We needed someone on the ground.
I was the only person that volunteered.

29:12.500 --> 29:15.916
No one in the US wants to see clearly
what's happening here in Europe.

29:19.875 --> 29:21.958
And now I don't know who to trust.

29:23.333 --> 29:26.958
Then people don't follow the rules,
so they're making up their own rules.

29:30.083 --> 29:31.875
Maybe they're right to do so.

29:34.583 --> 29:38.166
When the world is upside down,
which way is north?

29:43.708 --> 29:47.375
I'm doing two trips
back and forth to Martinique this winter.

29:47.375 --> 29:48.958
Cargo is light.

29:49.625 --> 29:51.583
About 200 people light.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.375
I can't send my refugees as stowaways.

29:58.083 --> 29:59.750
Then find another way.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.291
The offer stands.

30:03.916 --> 30:04.875
Checkmate.

30:13.791 --> 30:16.208
Our goal is to...

30:20.541 --> 30:24.833
consolidate internment camps
along the Eastern Front.

30:26.458 --> 30:31.416
The logistics of moving so many people
across Europe

30:31.416 --> 30:34.125
are complicated, of course.

30:34.125 --> 30:36.750
But not impossible.

30:38.583 --> 30:39.416
And...

30:40.125 --> 30:44.250
And we are ready to help
with everything you have in mind,

30:45.000 --> 30:49.416
because we are ambitious
here in Marseille.

30:50.333 --> 30:54.125
And we take the Jewish problem
very seriously.

30:54.125 --> 30:55.041
Good.

30:55.041 --> 30:56.708
And we await the day

30:56.708 --> 31:02.083
when our great country
will be free of their foreign influence.

31:06.375 --> 31:08.916
There is only one great country in Europe.

31:08.916 --> 31:10.916
Yeah. Of course.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.500
Of course.
I beg your pardon, Gruppenführer Schrader.

31:18.166 --> 31:19.750
France has been infected.

31:21.083 --> 31:23.250
But with your help, Gruppenführer,

31:24.166 --> 31:25.333
soon, one day,

31:26.291 --> 31:29.000
all these people will be under my heel.

31:30.500 --> 31:33.041
Our. Our... Our... Our heels.

31:39.583 --> 31:40.708
Cheers.

31:43.416 --> 31:44.250
Cheers.

32:03.875 --> 32:05.333
How did it go?

32:05.333 --> 32:08.333
I got Mehring safely out of town again,
and I brought this back.

32:09.541 --> 32:11.541
- Wait, no. No, no.
- Paul, don't try to stop me.

32:11.541 --> 32:13.916
No.
Hey, hey, hey, it's too dangerous.

32:15.166 --> 32:16.916
- Pull yourself together.
Stop!

32:18.791 --> 32:21.750
Take a deep breath. If you go through
with this, we are all going to die.

32:29.916 --> 32:33.125
Varian has been arrested,
and the police raided the villa.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.416
And MJ?

32:34.416 --> 32:38.416
They took her too. They are being held
on a boat down at the docks.

32:38.416 --> 32:40.166
Go. Go.

32:45.666 --> 32:48.375
So we've been arrested
because of a parade.

32:48.375 --> 32:50.708
That is what
the captain of the ship said, yes.

32:51.208 --> 32:52.708
It's ridiculous.

32:52.708 --> 32:55.500
Look for logic
and you will be disappointed.

32:56.291 --> 32:59.250
If we're lucky, they will release us,

32:59.250 --> 33:03.416
and tomorrow we'll find ourselves
exactly where we started today.

33:04.291 --> 33:05.416
But by then,

33:05.416 --> 33:08.208
we will know that it was paradise.

33:14.166 --> 33:16.708
You are all free to go.

33:26.666 --> 33:28.291
All right, let's go.
- Yes.

33:28.291 --> 33:29.250
Come on.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.083
Varian.

34:05.916 --> 34:08.375
Oh God, please don't look at me like that.

34:08.375 --> 34:10.500
I'm exhausted.
Can we do this in the morning?

34:10.500 --> 34:12.666
Just...
You were relying on me for the money.

34:12.666 --> 34:15.750
- You said you <i>had</i> the money!
- At first, I did.

34:15.750 --> 34:19.750
But then... then I didn't wanna let you down
or let down the--

34:21.625 --> 34:22.625
I understand.

34:26.333 --> 34:28.458
Are you sleeping with Patterson?

34:28.458 --> 34:30.375
Are you sleeping with Thomas?

34:30.375 --> 34:32.333
- Don't you dare--
- It was once.

34:32.333 --> 34:34.541
It was once, and I only did it

34:34.541 --> 34:36.416
because I thought
he'd help me with my father.

34:38.291 --> 34:41.791
- All in the name of the operation.
- No, it's the truth. Varian!

34:41.791 --> 34:45.125
We are on the same side here.
It's you, me, and Thomas.

34:47.416 --> 34:48.291
Lisa?

34:48.791 --> 34:51.541
The police arrested
a group of British soldiers in Banyuls.

34:51.541 --> 34:54.625
- What?
- They were carrying a map of my route.

34:55.333 --> 34:57.916
Written on a fashion magazine.

34:59.333 --> 35:00.333
Was it you?

35:01.750 --> 35:02.583
I--

35:02.583 --> 35:04.375
We had one way out.

35:05.541 --> 35:06.875
Now we have nothing.

35:08.083 --> 35:09.875
How could you be so stupid?

35:28.083 --> 35:31.125
Mr. Fry,
thank you for bringing André home.

35:34.416 --> 35:35.833
A telegram came for you.

35:39.291 --> 35:40.500
Thank you.

35:50.291 --> 35:51.833
Something from your wife?

35:55.541 --> 35:56.541
It's nothing.

36:01.083 --> 36:02.000
Varian.

36:04.666 --> 36:05.666
I'm going to bed.

36:06.291 --> 36:08.000
Good night.
Good night.

36:23.375 --> 36:24.458
God...

36:31.833 --> 36:32.750
Mr. Fry.

36:34.291 --> 36:37.708
- You won't believe the day I've had.
I am all ears.

36:37.708 --> 36:43.125
Just let me... see if Roosevelt is still
the president of the United States.

36:44.833 --> 36:46.958
<i>Despite strong isolationist sentiment</i>

36:46.958 --> 36:50.166
<i>across a nation
just emerging from the Great Depression,</i>

36:50.166 --> 36:53.250
<i>the American people
have broken tradition tonight</i>

36:53.250 --> 36:56.083
<i>to reelect President Roosevelt.</i>

36:56.083 --> 36:59.375
<i>He has defeated
dark horse candidate Wendell Willkie,</i>

36:59.375 --> 37:02.666
<i>a businessman who had
never run for political office.</i>

37:02.666 --> 37:03.958
<i>Is this a mandate</i>

37:03.958 --> 37:07.666
<i>to join Great Britain's bruising battle
against the Nazis?</i>

37:07.666 --> 37:09.375
<i>Europe holds its breath--</i>

38:11.250 --> 38:12.291
Mary Jayne!

38:13.083 --> 38:14.666
I came straight to the docks.

38:14.666 --> 38:18.333
And then that... that captain said
that you were held all day?

38:21.666 --> 38:23.041
What are you doing out here?

38:26.958 --> 38:27.875
Are you okay?

38:31.250 --> 38:33.250
I'm working with the British.
You were right.

38:36.375 --> 38:39.916
And Lisa's route over the Pyrenees
was just compromised because of me.

38:42.375 --> 38:45.083
- I'm sure you were only trying to help.

38:52.208 --> 38:55.208
I just keep thinking about
all the people in Chicago

38:56.541 --> 38:57.375
who think...

39:00.208 --> 39:02.875
what's happening here has
nothing to do with them.

39:05.083 --> 39:08.458
You know, people like my father,
who voted to stay out of this war

39:08.458 --> 39:11.000
and protect American lives.

39:12.458 --> 39:14.416
They haven't put anybody in jail.

39:15.958 --> 39:18.291
They don't have any blood on their hands.

39:21.666 --> 39:22.583
You know,

39:24.041 --> 39:28.416
none of us can predict
the exact consequences of our actions,

39:29.333 --> 39:31.833
but knowing that
does not justify inaction.

39:33.625 --> 39:35.708
Otherwise, what does it mean to be alive?

39:46.250 --> 39:47.125
Okay.
