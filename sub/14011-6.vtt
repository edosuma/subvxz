<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>
<i> the people are represented</i>

00:03.771 --> 00:06.372

00:06.374 --> 00:08.407
<i> the police,</i>
<i> who investigate crime,</i>

00:08.409 --> 00:11.143
<i> and the district attorneys,</i>

(<i> indistinct police radio</i>
<i> transmissions</i> )

00:26.060 --> 00:28.193
I want the Cadi.

00:28.195 --> 00:31.263
I'm happy with the velour,
and not even leather.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.132
I'm happy.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.333
What do I end up with?

00:34.335 --> 00:36.335
A damn Asian ant box.

00:45.479 --> 00:49.415
(<i> overlapping messages</i>

00:53.587 --> 00:56.155
Must have forgot
their keys.

00:56.157 --> 00:58.390
Hold it;
we got a vic.

Hey, watch it, Eddie--
he's got a gun!

01:17.611 --> 01:22.281
(<i> sirens wailing in distance</i> )

01:24.652 --> 01:25.651
Hey, Eddie,
forget the kid!

01:25.653 --> 01:27.653
This guy's
checking out!

01:38.432 --> 01:41.567
Since when's a ham
sandwich $2.75, Jesus?

01:41.569 --> 01:43.435
Since last Friday.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.538
I didn't know
ptomaine had gone up.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.674
We don't use none of that.

01:48.676 --> 01:51.110
It's all homemade.

(<i> horn honking</i> )

02:00.221 --> 02:01.353
What?!

02:01.355 --> 02:03.689
We got a 10-20;
could be a homicide.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.557
Vic conscious?

02:05.559 --> 02:08.327
Nope. Ambulance
is on the way.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.295
Around the potholes, huh?

02:10.297 --> 02:14.266
The suit's just back
from the cleaners.

Odds?

02:22.276 --> 02:25.544
EMT:
50-50, but I'm an optimist.

02:25.546 --> 02:28.147
I've seen this guy.

02:30.184 --> 02:32.584
Hochmeyer. Come here.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.453
Any I.D.?

02:34.455 --> 02:36.555
They took his wallet,
but we ran the car.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.157
Hey, who owns the Benz?

02:38.159 --> 02:40.192
Eddie, come on.

02:40.194 --> 02:44.263
It's registered to
Charles Halsey in Kew Gardens.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.468
Oh, that's great,
that's just terrific.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.203
You know the guy?

02:51.205 --> 02:52.571
Councilman Halsey?
Ring a bell?

02:52.573 --> 02:54.473
Dirtbag was always
mouthing off

02:54.475 --> 02:56.708
about the streets
being unsafe?

02:56.710 --> 02:59.645
I hate media cases.

   NBC/UNIVERSAL

04:21.895 --> 04:24.029
Ooh, they try
to get close to you,

04:24.031 --> 04:27.466
looking for anything that they
can get 500 words out of you.

04:27.468 --> 04:30.469
99% of them don't care about
you, the case, or who they hurt.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.470
They just want
to sell papers.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.904
And if you talk to them,

04:32.906 --> 04:34.473
they start calling
you at the office,

04:34.475 --> 04:35.474
tying up the lines.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.975
If you don't
talk to them,

04:36.977 --> 04:39.344
they starting writing about
how the police are stymied.

04:39.346 --> 04:42.547
Then, phone calls come in
from the brass downtown.

04:42.549 --> 04:44.016
You can't smoke that
in here.

04:44.018 --> 04:45.617
It's not lit.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.753
Not bad, Max.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.921
A prophet
in your own time.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.490
...was big news to you people.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.925
Then, you all just got tired
of hearing the truth.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.927
Oh, sure, you were all there
at his press conferences,

04:55.929 --> 04:58.930
but he was just exercising
his lungs.
(<i> camera clicking</i> )

04:58.932 --> 04:59.998
Now do you understand

05:00.000 --> 05:02.067
what Chuck Halsey
was screaming about?

05:02.069 --> 05:03.935
Our streets aren't safe
for anyone.

05:03.937 --> 05:06.705
You can check with our
office on Chuck's condition.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.640
We'll have regular
medical updates.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.609
Thank you, ladies
and gentlemen.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.544
(<i> reporters clamoring</i> )

05:12.546 --> 05:14.613
REPORTER:
Do you have any idea
what your husband was doing

05:14.615 --> 05:16.515
in that neighborhood
late at night?

05:16.517 --> 05:18.750
Excuse me.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.490
DOCTOR:
Go home and get some sleep.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.626
He made it through the surgery,
and that's half the battle.

05:27.628 --> 05:31.530
We'll call you immediately
if anything changes.

05:31.532 --> 05:34.399
Thank you, Doctor.

05:34.401 --> 05:36.068
Who are you?

05:36.070 --> 05:38.537
I'm Detective Logan,
this is Detective Greevey.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.672
I'm sorry
about your husband, ma'am.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.341
You're the investigating
officers?

05:42.343 --> 05:43.542
LOGAN:
Yeah.

05:43.544 --> 05:45.510
We heard
it was two black kids.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.511
You have anything else?

05:46.513 --> 05:48.547
Not yet.

05:48.549 --> 05:52.417
Could you give me
a description of his
personal items, ma'am?

05:52.419 --> 05:56.488
He always carried a, uh,
a brown alligator wallet,

05:56.490 --> 05:59.624
and, um, he had a
star sapphire ring

05:59.626 --> 06:02.427
and a gold
and diamond Rolex,

06:02.429 --> 06:05.530
and he always had
about $500 cash.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.799
Your husband
have any enemies?

06:07.801 --> 06:09.735
CONTI:
Chuck Halsey is one
of the most respected

06:09.737 --> 06:11.603
and liked men
in this district.

06:11.605 --> 06:14.573
I'm sure he is. Ma'am?

06:14.575 --> 06:16.575
What are you asking me?

06:16.577 --> 06:18.077
I thought you knew
who did it.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.578
LOGAN:
No, we knew
two black kids were there.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.580
They didn't drive him
to that location.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.648
Do you have any idea
what he was doing
way out there?

06:25.619 --> 06:27.619
Chuck had
a political dinner.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.088
I was there;
it ended around 10:30.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.623
LOGAN:
Did he leave alone?

06:31.625 --> 06:33.592
I have no idea.

06:33.594 --> 06:37.796
Are you going to be able
to catch these... kids?

06:37.798 --> 06:39.531
I'm not going
to lie to you.

06:39.533 --> 06:42.167
It will take a break
or a miracle.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.102
What kind
of miracle?

06:44.104 --> 06:47.539
One of them walking in
and confessing might help.

06:49.143 --> 06:52.477
We have to get back
to the precinct garage.

06:52.479 --> 06:54.613
We'll try to get your car
back to you

06:54.615 --> 06:55.747
as soon as possible, ma'am.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.583
Thank you,
Detective.

07:00.854 --> 07:04.656
It's okay, it's okay.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.093
That was smart.

07:08.095 --> 07:11.163
Hey, there's no sense in
her having any illusions.

07:11.165 --> 07:13.866
Oh, right.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.568
Conti got a real charge
out of your sense of humor.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.537
Yeah?

07:18.539 --> 07:22.541
Are you trying to tell me
this thing plays straight?

07:22.543 --> 07:24.509
Let's check Halsey's car.

07:24.511 --> 07:29.080
What was he doing there
after a political dinner?

07:29.082 --> 07:31.550
Let's check the car.

07:31.552 --> 07:32.751
Oh, well,
wait a minute.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.786
<i>Wait</i> a minute.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.855
What do you got?

07:38.525 --> 07:40.525
Old rumors.

07:40.527 --> 07:44.496
That's great;
what kind?

07:44.498 --> 07:47.666
Rumor was that he ran the
pad in the criminal courts.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.668
He's a bagman?

07:49.670 --> 07:51.670
<i> Was...</i>

07:51.672 --> 07:54.539
if you believe
the rumors.

07:54.541 --> 07:57.676
This really frosts
my cookies, Max.

07:57.678 --> 08:01.546
You mind telling me
why you didn't tell me?

08:01.548 --> 08:03.248
Because you're already
leaping to conclusions

08:03.250 --> 08:05.650
for Pete's sakes.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.553
About the only probable
conclusion that we can draw

08:08.555 --> 08:12.257
is that the black kids
took whatever they found.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.696
Let's check the car.

08:24.238 --> 08:28.573
60 bucks for a damn key.

08:28.575 --> 08:30.575
I could have popped
the thing for nothing.

08:30.577 --> 08:33.645
Car belongs
to a councilman.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.850
Is that real?

08:38.852 --> 08:41.253
How much?

08:41.255 --> 08:43.255
12 and up.

08:43.257 --> 08:46.625
Must be crazy
about his old lady.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.263
GREEVEY:
<i> I don't want to tell her,</i>
<i> but what else</i>

08:51.265 --> 08:52.764
can we do?

08:52.766 --> 08:54.866
But Halsey could still
pull through, right?

08:54.868 --> 08:56.768
Eight to five, against.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.838
Surgeon says
it's in God's hands.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.840
Well, that must
be comforting.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.542
Well?

09:03.544 --> 09:06.578
The guy wakes up, and the coat
wasn't for the wife

09:06.580 --> 09:08.580
and we've told her...

09:08.582 --> 09:09.681
Thanks for your help,
Captain.

09:09.683 --> 09:12.684
Keep in touch.

09:14.621 --> 09:17.622
Since when does that mean
we don't go?

09:17.624 --> 09:18.890
Hey, Max.
Yeah.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.692
Jacobson down at the trib.

09:20.694 --> 09:23.228
I'm out.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.602
No labels.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.804
Maggie's got
a friend.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.639
Works for a furrier.

09:34.641 --> 09:37.042
MAN:
You catch
the Halsey mugging?

09:37.044 --> 09:38.677
Yeah.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.645
Give Perez a call
in Narco.

09:40.647 --> 09:42.631
Perez?

09:42.632 --> 09:44.616
He's the one doesn't shave?
Yeah.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.301
We take down the crack house

09:46.302 --> 09:47.985
and roll up
this scum ball dealer Rodriguez,

09:47.988 --> 09:49.621
along with
the half a dozen customers.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.022
Rodriguez is on probation

09:51.024 --> 09:53.325
and knows he's going back
for a deuce,

09:53.327 --> 09:56.661
so he gives us this kid
who he says came in with a wad

09:56.663 --> 10:00.932
that he had taken off
some white dude in a Mercedes.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.767
When I got in here,

10:02.769 --> 10:07.906
I read the APB,
and, boom, called upstairs.

10:08.842 --> 10:11.876
LOGAN:
Monster case of the yips?

10:11.878 --> 10:13.778
GREEVEY:
He's good for nothing
till he comes down.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.880
LOGAN:
Nah, I'm going to have him
singing the name game

10:15.882 --> 10:17.282
in five minutes.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.851
What, $20?

10:27.394 --> 10:29.694
Rodriguez would rat out
his own mama.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.847
Don't know nothing!

10:31.848 --> 10:33.999
And you ain't got squat on me,
except for what he said,

10:34.001 --> 10:36.001
and that's just heresy.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.737
The word's hearsay, Simonize.

10:38.739 --> 10:39.938
Yeah, that's it,

10:39.940 --> 10:42.707
and I be good
for no say.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.409
Hey, shut up.

10:44.411 --> 10:47.646
We don't dig being dissed
by lightweights.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.347
Mike, Mike,

10:49.349 --> 10:52.784
he's not being disrespectful;
he's just being reflective.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.422
What are you
looking at?

10:57.424 --> 10:59.424
Turn around.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.695
Eight arrests
and he still doesn't get it?

11:03.697 --> 11:09.401
Hey, judges help those
who help themselves.

11:09.403 --> 11:11.036
Going...

11:11.038 --> 11:14.105
Now, I'm not talking
about a year in Spofford.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.741
Going...

11:16.743 --> 11:18.076
Don't be stupid!
Gone.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.679
Back to your
cage, Simonize.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.447
Get up.

11:25.719 --> 11:28.720
Simonize.
What a surprise.

11:28.722 --> 11:31.389
You getting some career
counseling from Greevey?

11:31.391 --> 11:32.424
I ain't
done nothing!

11:32.426 --> 11:33.825
Such a polite young man.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.093
Well, of course, you haven't.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.696
We always go out
and arrest innocent people.

11:37.698 --> 11:38.830
Who does this jerk
hang with?

11:38.832 --> 11:40.765
How's Tremaine
these days?

11:40.767 --> 11:43.902
Ain't seen him.
It's amazing how you homeboys
are always apart.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.071
Tremaine Lewis.
I got his address upstairs.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.773
Simonize lives
with his grandmother.

11:48.775 --> 11:50.909
(<i> chuckles</i> )
Grandmother?!

11:50.911 --> 11:55.146
(<i> laughter in distance</i> )

12:02.456 --> 12:04.456
You the man?

12:04.458 --> 12:06.458
We sure are, honey.

12:06.460 --> 12:09.160
(<i> pounding on door</i> )

12:11.164 --> 12:13.798
WOMAN:
Who is it?

12:13.800 --> 12:16.735
GREEVEY:
Police, Mrs. Jackson.

12:16.737 --> 12:19.804
You sure this paper
says you can do that

12:19.806 --> 12:22.073
even when he ain't here?

12:22.075 --> 12:24.075
Yes, ma'am.

12:24.077 --> 12:27.946
That's a search warrant,
signed by a judge.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.948
First time
the police

12:29.950 --> 12:32.517
ever brought
a search warrant.

12:32.519 --> 12:37.021
Simon done something real bad
this time, huh?

12:42.529 --> 12:44.529
Yes, ma'am.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.098
Looks that way.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.467
Lots of noise.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.803
Plenty of warning.

12:58.411 --> 13:01.813
GREEVEY:
Tremaine Lewis! NYPD.

13:04.217 --> 13:07.085
Drop the gun, Tremaine!

13:20.534 --> 13:22.801
Give it up!

13:33.146 --> 13:35.180
GREEVEY:
Look at me when I'm talking
to you!

13:37.117 --> 13:39.150
And if the
councilman croaks,

13:39.152 --> 13:42.987
you guys move up to
the bigs, murder two.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.422
We're telling you
the truth, man.

13:44.424 --> 13:47.158
We didn't do nothing
to him.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.526
You guys willing
to swear

13:48.528 --> 13:52.030
you two were together
the whole night?

13:52.032 --> 13:55.466
You got that right.
Hmm?

13:57.437 --> 14:01.039
You know what we found
in Simonize's apartment?

14:05.879 --> 14:08.880
I ain't never seen that.

14:08.882 --> 14:11.883
Simonize, you holding out
on your main man?

14:14.254 --> 14:17.488
That is the vic's watch.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.896
Anybody want to make a deal?

14:24.898 --> 14:26.865
(<i> door opens</i> )

14:26.867 --> 14:29.200
You didn't plea these guys,
did you?

14:29.202 --> 14:31.569
We're still talking.

14:31.571 --> 14:32.570
Stop.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.607
Councilman?

14:40.580 --> 14:42.046
Now, wait a damn minute...

14:43.149 --> 14:45.583
He's saying
the dude croaked?

14:45.585 --> 14:48.319
I'm saying you blew it.

14:48.321 --> 14:51.289
Look, he was already cut

14:51.291 --> 14:52.958
when we got there.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.626
We took them off,
but we didn't do nothing to him.

14:54.628 --> 14:55.927
He's telling the truth.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.061
He was just lying
there bleeding.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.563
It was that white cat

14:58.565 --> 15:00.815
in the Benz.

15:00.816 --> 15:03.066
He got out as soon as
the truck pulled off.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.502
What truck?

15:04.504 --> 15:07.605
I've been thinking
about yesterday.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.207
That was great.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.943
<i>I</i> thought Halsey
had croaked.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.279
Tony Halliwell?
Yeah?

15:14.281 --> 15:16.547
I'm Detective Greevey,
this is Detective Logan.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.349
Is there a problem?

15:18.351 --> 15:21.552
Dispatcher said you made a late
delivery on Tuesday night.

15:21.554 --> 15:24.322
Uh-huh.
Anybody else here
when you arrived?

15:24.324 --> 15:26.624
Just the night man;
he was inside.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.293
And outside?

15:28.295 --> 15:33.564
Yeah, there were a couple
of cars parked right there:

15:33.566 --> 15:37.201
a gray Mercedes
and a red Jag XJ-S.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.937
Hey, that's very observant,
Tony.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.238
Yeah, I like cars.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.572
You see anything else?

15:41.574 --> 15:43.057
Yeah, when I drove in,

15:43.058 --> 15:44.541
there were two guys
at the rear of the jag.

15:44.544 --> 15:45.610
Trunk pops open,

15:45.612 --> 15:47.345
guy reaches in pulls
out a fur coat

15:47.347 --> 15:49.080
and hands it
to the other guy.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.715
Could you identify them?

15:50.717 --> 15:51.950
Yeah, sure.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.835
Then what happened?

15:53.836 --> 15:55.719
The other guy opens up
the trunk of the Mercedes

15:55.722 --> 15:58.473
puts it in there.

15:58.474 --> 16:01.225
They both climb into the
Mercedes, and I go inside.

16:01.227 --> 16:02.293
Thanks.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.562
You've been very helpful.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.965
Sure.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.353
I didn't know you hung
with the carriage trade.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.620
Hello to you, too.

16:29.622 --> 16:30.722
Max.

16:30.724 --> 16:32.090
Maggie.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.157
Second floor.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.726
Talk to her boss.

16:34.728 --> 16:37.295
She thinks
he'll know who made it.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.430
So is this good
for a dinner?

16:39.432 --> 16:41.632
Well, that depends on
what dinner's good for.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.034
Oh. Well, let's put it
this way:

16:43.036 --> 16:44.769
you don't have a chance in hell
without it.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.371
Very cold, Maggie.

16:46.373 --> 16:50.008
So light my fire.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.276
MAN:
<i> And then, among lynx,</i>

16:52.278 --> 16:55.213
there are as many variations
as there are among people.

16:55.215 --> 16:58.750
So is this coat Meryl Streep
or Whoopi Goldberg?

16:58.752 --> 17:00.718
More the latter
than the former, I'm afraid.

17:00.720 --> 17:04.322
Canadian farm grown, male pelts,
basic coat, not a designer's.

17:04.324 --> 17:05.974
Flash but basically trash.

17:05.975 --> 17:07.625
You mind if we cut
to the chase, Mr. Farber?

17:07.627 --> 17:09.694
Oh. There are
about three furriers

17:09.696 --> 17:11.329
who do these type
of garbage goods,

17:11.331 --> 17:13.698
but your best bet
is Kornbluth on 22nd.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.034
MAN:
They're Russians, you cretin.

17:16.036 --> 17:19.203
Don't give them a dime
until you have the pelts.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.105
What?

17:21.107 --> 17:22.373
You Kornbluth?

17:22.375 --> 17:25.410
There hasn't been a Kornbluth
here since 1957.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.677
I'm Swersky.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.212
What do you want?

17:28.214 --> 17:29.814
Where's the owner?

17:29.816 --> 17:31.749
What is this,
20 questions?

17:31.751 --> 17:35.787
I'm Detective Logan,
and this is Detective Greevey.

17:35.789 --> 17:39.157
Now, is this your coat?

17:39.159 --> 17:41.359
Possible.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.227
I mean, it looks
like one of mine,

17:43.229 --> 17:45.229
but I don't know
every coat.

17:45.231 --> 17:49.367
Now you're starting
to tick me off, Mr. Swersky.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.369
Why is it I think
that Mr. Swersky

17:51.371 --> 17:54.505
recognized that coat the minute
it walked in the door?

17:54.507 --> 17:56.340
You want to tell me
what you want.

17:56.342 --> 17:57.475
No.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.811
Who bought the coat?

17:59.813 --> 18:01.412
It was a gift.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.681
What kind of car
do you drive?

18:03.683 --> 18:06.084
A Cadillac
Coupe de Ville.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.485
Why?

18:07.487 --> 18:09.520
Who was the gift for?

18:09.522 --> 18:11.389
You know, I really think maybe

18:11.391 --> 18:14.492
I should give
my attorney a call, huh?

18:14.494 --> 18:17.228
Absolutely.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.230
Feel free.

18:19.232 --> 18:22.767
Maybe I should give Gaffner
a call down at the firehouse.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.869
Now, aren't some of those pelts

18:24.871 --> 18:27.405
covering
fire sprinklers?

18:27.407 --> 18:31.309
And call Ulasewicz over at
the buildings department.

18:31.311 --> 18:34.479
I saw a lot
of violations.

18:36.416 --> 18:39.550
Tony Scalisi.

18:39.552 --> 18:43.754
Where do I know that name?

18:46.459 --> 18:49.160
Masucci family.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.562
God, he finds out
I told you...

18:51.564 --> 18:54.232
Why did he want the coat?

18:54.234 --> 18:56.467
What am I, Karnak?

19:00.173 --> 19:01.839
Trucker give you
a positive I.D.?

19:01.841 --> 19:03.174
Right from the picture.

19:03.176 --> 19:04.775
So did Lewis
and Jackson.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.410
Read the rap sheet.

19:06.412 --> 19:09.213
Mr. Scalisi likes
to slice and dice.

19:09.215 --> 19:12.817
And guess who leases
a red Jaguar XJ-S?

19:12.819 --> 19:14.452
Halsey regain consciousness?

19:14.454 --> 19:16.854
GREEVEY:
Doctors aren't very optimistic.

19:16.856 --> 19:20.191
Captain, why don't we  wait
to see if Halsey buys the farm.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.859
Murder's a better collar.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.428
I'm getting
my butt barbecued.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.931
Borough president
called for a task force.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.466
He wants to take it
away from us.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.801
Deputy Commander Jefferson
calls twice a day.

19:30.803 --> 19:32.336
What's he want?

19:32.338 --> 19:33.471
Doesn't want me
to forget

19:33.473 --> 19:37.542
that this is
a politically sensitive case.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.579
I don't want to wait.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.414
Get a warrant.

19:44.484 --> 19:47.285
Go on.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.520
Yes, sir.

19:56.563 --> 19:57.895
Which night school
Clarence Darrow

19:57.897 --> 20:01.365
is handling this?

20:01.367 --> 20:04.335
Name's Robinette.

20:04.337 --> 20:07.505
$20 says he won't file.

20:07.507 --> 20:10.908
These defensive bets
are going to kill you.

20:10.910 --> 20:16.981
(<i> overlapping conversing</i> )

20:20.820 --> 20:22.520
MAN:
And then, what happened?

20:22.522 --> 20:25.223
And after that,
he picks up the baby,

20:25.225 --> 20:27.525
and he starts shaking her.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.493
And her head
just starts flopping...
Thank you.

20:29.495 --> 20:32.463
Is that when
you called 911?

20:33.499 --> 20:35.399
MAN:
Well, if it was self-defense

20:35.401 --> 20:37.468
how come you shot him
in the back?

20:41.641 --> 20:43.541
Robinette?

20:43.543 --> 20:44.875
Uh, Logan.

20:44.877 --> 20:48.246
Greevey, he's Logan.

20:48.248 --> 20:51.515
Stone's willing to file,
but it's a reach.

20:51.517 --> 20:53.851
I've sent a lot
of guys away

20:53.853 --> 20:55.987
on circumstantial
evidence.

20:55.989 --> 20:58.856
Anyway, I think this
is more than that.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.458
What kind of more?

21:00.460 --> 21:02.293
You know that Halsey
was a bagman?

21:02.295 --> 21:04.929
Stone mentioned that.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.564
Then mention to
Stone that Deputy
Commander Jefferson

21:07.567 --> 21:09.433
has been nosing around.

21:09.435 --> 21:12.003
Tell him I thought
he'd like to know.

21:12.005 --> 21:13.504
You're new, aren't you?

21:13.506 --> 21:15.973
How long you been
with Stone?

21:15.975 --> 21:17.041
Eight months.

21:17.043 --> 21:19.343
Must be a record.

21:20.546 --> 21:23.514
See you in court.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.519
Must be out.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.521
No answer.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.323
You guys
just got lucky.

21:32.325 --> 21:34.558
Here he comes.

21:34.560 --> 21:38.462
I hate pit bulls.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.665
If he drops the leash,
shoot the dog first.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.667
Go over there.

21:45.738 --> 21:48.339
Anthony Scalisi, I have
a warrant for your arrest.

21:48.341 --> 21:50.308
Don't move.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.643
(<i> dog growling</i> )

21:56.949 --> 21:59.350
What's the charge?

21:59.352 --> 22:01.052
Assault with a deadly weapon
and the attempted murder

22:01.054 --> 22:02.553
of Charles Halsey.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.993
Spuds moves, you're history.

22:13.032 --> 22:14.899
MAN:
<i>Criminal possession of a weapon</i>

22:14.901 --> 22:17.068
in the third degree,
criminal possession of a weapon

22:17.070 --> 22:18.903
in the second degree,
assault in the second degree,

22:18.905 --> 22:20.071
assault in the first degree

22:20.073 --> 22:21.873
attempted murder
in the second degree.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.674
Counselor, waive reading
of the rights and charges?

22:23.676 --> 22:24.775
So waived.

22:24.777 --> 22:25.943
And how does
your client plead?

22:25.945 --> 22:27.378
Not guilty.

22:27.380 --> 22:30.014
JUDGE:
People on bail?

22:30.016 --> 22:32.049
Your Honor, the defendant
has been convicted

22:32.051 --> 22:33.084
of murder once before.

22:33.086 --> 22:35.453
He is a repeat offender.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.388
He's a soldier
in the Masucci family

22:37.390 --> 22:39.390
and is considered a flight risk.

22:39.392 --> 22:42.460
This office requests
that he be held without bail.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.095
I'm afraid I am loathe
to withhold bail

22:44.097 --> 22:46.497
on all except homicide cases,
Counselor.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.401
$100,000...

22:50.403 --> 22:51.936
cash or bond.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.137
Short date.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.876
Thought Stone would be here.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.878
At a button man's
arraignment?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.446
Have no fear, Eddie.

23:02.447 --> 23:04.013
Stone's looking forward
to seeing you in court.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.116
What's
his schedule like?

23:05.118 --> 23:07.017
Depends on who's coming
to call.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.119
Come on, Paul,
this whole thing

23:08.121 --> 23:10.121
is just one step
above a roust.

23:10.123 --> 23:11.122
It's a two-minute
negotiation.

23:11.124 --> 23:13.023
I wouldn't count on it.

23:13.025 --> 23:15.025
Halsey's still
touch and go.

23:15.027 --> 23:17.395
Nobody dies
of a knife wound

23:17.397 --> 23:18.996
a week later.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.965
Predicate violence?

23:20.967 --> 23:24.168
Stone hates pleading
on predicate violence.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.778
(<i> knocking</i> )

23:35.181 --> 23:38.048
(<i> whispering:</i> )
Cosmatos.

23:38.050 --> 23:41.419
Call me irresponsible,
Eddie, but I like you.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.421
You're a hell
of a lawyer.

23:43.423 --> 23:46.090
That's why I'm always amazed
at how incredibly guilty

23:46.092 --> 23:47.425
your clients are.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.527
Scalisi's lower
than snake spit.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.128
Well, you want to waste

23:51.130 --> 23:54.799
more of your client's money,
come on down Thursday.

23:56.102 --> 23:59.904
I'm Eddie Cosmatos.

23:59.906 --> 24:02.506
I can't wait to put this
in front of a jury.

24:02.508 --> 24:05.142
Two black kids are found
with the victim's possessions.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.144
The other eyewitness
puts Scalisi there,

24:07.146 --> 24:10.080
but they only time they saw him
was when he was with Halsey,

24:10.082 --> 24:11.482
he was perfectly fine,

24:11.484 --> 24:13.918
so why does Eddie want to plea
his client?

24:13.920 --> 24:16.887
Judicial calendar
doesn't publish until next week.

24:16.889 --> 24:19.156
Scalisi draws Robards
or Kapstein...

24:19.158 --> 24:21.025
He gets 15 to life.

24:21.027 --> 24:23.894
He draws Rosen or Gonzales,
he gets an apology.

24:23.896 --> 24:26.964
So what do 99 defense lawyers
out of 100 do?

24:26.966 --> 24:28.532
Wait for the calendar
to come out.

24:28.534 --> 24:32.036
And you only make five percent
of what Eddie makes.

24:32.038 --> 24:35.873
What did Greevey mean about
Deputy Commander Jefferson?

24:35.875 --> 24:38.008
Jefferson and I don't dance.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.577
The guy's a hero.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.979
He's a lying,
two-faced bastard.

24:41.981 --> 24:45.483
Wait a minute, I grew up
around the corner from him.

24:45.485 --> 24:46.917
He coached
my little league team.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.986
I wouldn't even be a lawyer
if it wasn't for him.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.522
I'm sure his dog
loves him, too.

24:51.524 --> 24:52.990
You know how many black kids
look up to him.

24:52.992 --> 24:56.193
He's one of the highest
ranking black cops ever.

24:56.195 --> 24:58.229
If he's wrong, he's wrong.

24:58.231 --> 25:00.931
If he's so wrong,
how come nobody knows it?

25:00.933 --> 25:02.199
I know it.

25:02.201 --> 25:05.269
Come on,
let's beat the traffic.

25:10.209 --> 25:13.210
STONE:
I used to hear things
about Halsey along time ago,

25:13.212 --> 25:16.213
but he's had a good reputation
the last ten years.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.516
Funny thing about reputations...

25:18.518 --> 25:20.084
Now, don't start
on that, Paul.

25:20.086 --> 25:21.285
I just think...
You're not thinking.

25:21.287 --> 25:23.020
If Jefferson was white,

25:23.022 --> 25:25.122
you wouldn't doubt
a word I'm saying.

25:25.123 --> 25:27.223
Only reason he's still got
a badge is because he's black.

25:27.226 --> 25:31.195
Really? Why don't you just
tell me what the hell he did?

25:31.197 --> 25:33.063
He perjured himself
as a captain,

25:33.065 --> 25:34.565
changed his
testimony on me.

25:34.567 --> 25:37.167
Somebody bought him,
that's one.

25:37.169 --> 25:41.005
Another time, he doctored
evidence in a numbers case.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.107
I'm not going to do this, Paul.

25:43.109 --> 25:45.175
You're either on my team
or Jefferson's.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.250
... and since he never
discussed business with me,

25:53.252 --> 25:56.120
I had no idea he was involved
in illegal activities.

25:56.122 --> 25:58.022
We just had dinner

25:58.024 --> 26:00.257
with Deputy Police
Commander Jefferson

26:00.259 --> 26:02.126
and his wife,
for God's sake.

26:02.128 --> 26:04.194
Mom?

26:04.196 --> 26:06.163
I'm going to head on
over to Gran's.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.198
She's still a little shaky.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.601
I'll be back in an hour.
Okay, sweetie.

26:17.076 --> 26:20.077
Kenneth was going to Annapolis,

26:20.079 --> 26:23.113
but with what's
going to come out,

26:23.115 --> 26:26.283
he'll never be able to get
a congressional appointment.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.953
Mr. Halsey
never wanted Mrs. Halsey

26:28.955 --> 26:31.322
to be burdened with unnecessary
business details.

26:31.324 --> 26:34.291
Is there anything else
you'd like to know?

26:34.293 --> 26:35.659
Her coat size.

26:39.765 --> 26:43.233
12... I wear a 12.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.202
Thank you, Mrs. Halsey--
one more thing.

26:45.204 --> 26:47.938
Did you ever hear of somebody
called Anthony Scalisi?

26:47.940 --> 26:49.940
No, I don't recall that name.
Why?

26:49.942 --> 26:52.209
He was a man we suspect
attacked your husband.

26:52.211 --> 26:55.179
A black boy named Scalisi?

26:55.181 --> 26:58.182
Two blacks in custody confessed
to robbing your husband

26:58.184 --> 27:00.084
but Scalisi was the one
who slashed him.

27:00.086 --> 27:02.086
Do you have any idea
why somebody might want

27:02.088 --> 27:03.354
to attack Mr. Halsey?

27:03.356 --> 27:05.055
Mrs. Halsey already told you

27:05.057 --> 27:06.223
she didn't know Tony Scalisi,
all right?

27:06.225 --> 27:08.209
Mr. Wentzel.

27:08.210 --> 27:10.194
We won't take up any more
of Mrs. Halsey's time,

27:10.196 --> 27:11.629
but why don't you let us

27:11.631 --> 27:14.331
buy you a cup
of coffee?

27:14.333 --> 27:16.200
STONE:
Mrs. Halsey
wears a 12.

27:16.202 --> 27:18.102
The coat is an eight.

27:18.104 --> 27:19.203
Who is she,
Mr. Wentzel?

27:19.205 --> 27:20.270
You can't be serious.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.106
I can't tell...

27:22.108 --> 27:24.174
You're gonna make
me very angry if you
finish that sentence.

27:24.176 --> 27:25.275
Hey, what is this?

27:25.277 --> 27:26.710
We're talking privacy here.

27:26.712 --> 27:28.112
No, we're talking
obstruction here.

27:28.114 --> 27:29.213
That's what
we're talking.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.347
Now, wait
just a damn second...

27:30.349 --> 27:32.316
No, you wait--
this case stinks.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.652
Your friend was a bagman

27:34.654 --> 27:36.120
long before he
was a councilman,

27:36.122 --> 27:38.205
and old habits die hard.

27:38.206 --> 27:40.289
Now, I'm going to start
sending out subpoenas.

27:40.292 --> 27:42.159
I find out that you

27:42.161 --> 27:45.195
had any knowledge
of person or persons

27:45.197 --> 27:47.398
who were involved
with your friend
in illegal activity,

27:47.400 --> 27:49.299
I'll have your butt.

27:52.238 --> 27:55.339
Now, what's her
name, Mr. Wentzel?

28:00.246 --> 28:01.845
Alicia Heslin?

28:01.847 --> 28:05.049
Um... she's in sweaters.

28:10.256 --> 28:11.689
Miss Heslin?

28:11.691 --> 28:14.024
Yes?

28:14.026 --> 28:15.359
My name's Paul Robinette.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.461
I'm from the district
attorney's office.

28:17.463 --> 28:18.829
Yes?

28:18.831 --> 28:21.131
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

28:21.133 --> 28:22.232
About what?

28:22.234 --> 28:24.068
Charles Halsey.

28:27.139 --> 28:29.773
I've been expecting you.

28:34.346 --> 28:37.214
STONE:
I like the story you wrote
on Congressman Macgruder.

28:37.216 --> 28:40.184
So, what do you want?

28:40.186 --> 28:44.154
Everything you got
on Charles Halsey.

28:46.125 --> 28:49.126
How much do you know
about parking meters?

28:49.128 --> 28:51.145
They all run fast.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.163
And a lot of people who get
tickets don't pay them.

28:53.165 --> 28:56.467
Collecting all that money
for all those unpaid tickets

28:56.469 --> 28:58.235
is a very big headache

28:58.237 --> 29:00.738
for the head of the parking
violations bureau.

29:00.740 --> 29:02.506
He has to get
a little outside help.

29:02.508 --> 29:05.175
That means a big contract.
Ah.

29:05.177 --> 29:08.479
Very big,
very lucrative contract.

29:08.481 --> 29:10.948
Who has it?

29:10.949 --> 29:13.416
Interesting little company
called Carnegie Collections.

29:13.419 --> 29:18.288
She's got champagne tastes--
Cartier watch, alligator shoes.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.857
When she first heard about it,

29:19.859 --> 29:21.792
she thought he might have been
trying to commit suicide.

29:21.794 --> 29:22.893
Why? Was he depressed?

29:22.895 --> 29:24.328
He'd been subpoenaed--

29:24.330 --> 29:27.164
federal grand jury
on municipal corruption.

29:27.166 --> 29:28.899
Oh, and how's this grab you.

29:28.901 --> 29:31.301
Her apartment lease is made out
to Carnegie Collections.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.170
She wear a size eight coat?

29:33.172 --> 29:34.404
Right off the rack.

29:34.406 --> 29:35.806
He tell her names?

29:35.808 --> 29:37.341
Last month,
it was all he talked about.

29:37.343 --> 29:39.910
Told her who had done what to
whom and how they had done it.

29:39.912 --> 29:41.278
Will she testify?

29:41.280 --> 29:43.180
Most of it's
unusable anyway.

29:43.182 --> 29:46.884
"Chuck told me that Scalisi told
him that Van Damme told him,"

29:46.886 --> 29:49.020
that kind of thing.

29:49.021 --> 29:51.155
She did say he couldn't figure
out how this was happening,

29:51.157 --> 29:55.225
since he had a deputy
police commander in his pocket.

29:55.227 --> 29:57.361
JEFFERSON:
I can tell you now
that six days

29:57.363 --> 29:59.429
of jury deliberation
did have me worried.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.365
REPORTER:
Well, you must be very pleased

30:01.367 --> 30:02.566
with the verdict,
Deputy Commander.

30:02.568 --> 30:04.168
I am, Chuck, I truly am.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.403
Our high schools
must be protected

30:06.405 --> 30:09.239
from the drug-dealing scum
trying to poison our children.

30:09.241 --> 30:10.440
Mr. Jefferson.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.176
Deputy Commander,
can I ask you this?

30:12.178 --> 30:14.244
Do you feel that the
impact of this verdict

30:14.246 --> 30:15.913
will be felt
on the streets
of New York?

30:19.285 --> 30:21.285
How deep does this go?

30:21.287 --> 30:24.354
It's not confined to
the parking violations bureau,

30:24.356 --> 30:26.290
that's for sure.
Why not?

30:26.292 --> 30:28.892
Halsey's been the bagman
for 20 years

30:28.894 --> 30:30.294
Scalisi's mobbed up,

30:30.296 --> 30:31.929
and according to
a reporter I know,

30:31.931 --> 30:33.564
several other councilmen
and politicians

30:33.566 --> 30:35.933
are stockholders
in Carnegie Collection,

30:35.935 --> 30:37.968
as well as the deputy
police commander,

30:37.970 --> 30:40.270
one William Jefferson.

30:40.272 --> 30:41.722
Jefferson?
Is this personal?

30:41.723 --> 30:43.173
Is that why you
want to bring the feds in?

30:43.175 --> 30:45.209
I'd love
to nail the bastard,

30:45.211 --> 30:46.410
but with him involved,

30:46.412 --> 30:48.579
we get one surveillance
leak, we're dead.

30:48.581 --> 30:50.414
We're secure with
the bureau doing it.

30:50.416 --> 30:53.450
Let the feds have the ink
on municipal corruption.

30:53.452 --> 30:54.852
They may even help me

30:54.854 --> 30:58.255
get a conspiracy to
murder on these bozos.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.224
(<i> sighs</i> )

31:00.225 --> 31:02.192
You never know whose pants
are going to get dropped

31:02.194 --> 31:03.627
in a corruption scandal.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.028
Hey, this started out
as a mugging.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.897
I'll back you.

31:06.899 --> 31:09.900
But don't bring me any names
unless they're dead-bang guilty.

31:09.902 --> 31:12.436
I want a smoking gun
I want it in somebody's hand.

31:12.438 --> 31:13.904
Are you telling
me tape?

31:13.906 --> 31:15.038
Tape would be a start.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.907
Can I offer
Scalisi immunity?

31:16.909 --> 31:20.577
Nope. It would look like he's
naming people to save himself.

31:20.579 --> 31:23.046
I wouldn't want you to go out
on a limb here, Alfred.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.382
That's not what I get
the big bucks for.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.317
(<i> buzzer sounding</i> )

31:27.319 --> 31:28.585
Yes?

31:28.587 --> 31:30.921
WOMAN:
Mr. Stone has an urgent call.

31:30.923 --> 31:32.589
A lawyer named Cosmatos.

31:32.591 --> 31:34.591
Somebody wants to make a deal.

31:36.662 --> 31:39.263
Cosmatos and Scalisi
are in your office.

31:39.265 --> 31:41.265
Call Judge Ichaso.

31:41.267 --> 31:43.100
Get warrants
for Halsey, Scalisi,

31:43.101 --> 31:44.934
Jefferson's phone records,
and talk to Halsey's doctor.

31:44.937 --> 31:46.470
See when we can
interrogate him.

31:46.472 --> 31:47.938
COSMATOS:
<i> So we steadfastly maintain</i>

31:47.940 --> 31:49.473
that the slashing was done

31:49.475 --> 31:51.608
by the black youths
seen fleeing the scene.

31:51.610 --> 31:54.344
We all know you never know
what will happen with a jury,

31:54.346 --> 31:55.545
so we would be willing
to negotiate

31:55.547 --> 31:57.014
some sort of an agreement.

31:57.016 --> 31:59.082
Don't do me any favors.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.251
I'm more than willing
to let the people decide.

32:01.253 --> 32:04.521
Bottom line: what do you want?

32:04.523 --> 32:06.957
Who paid you to do Halsey?

32:06.959 --> 32:08.692
Look, you want
to talk city corruption?

32:08.694 --> 32:11.028
No deal without the names.

32:12.364 --> 32:13.563
Pass.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.101
STONE:
What's up?

32:18.103 --> 32:19.636
Hospital just called.

32:19.638 --> 32:23.040
Charles Halsey
died half an hour ago.

32:28.981 --> 32:32.049
We'll get back to you.

32:32.051 --> 32:34.017
I haven't even made
an offer.

32:34.019 --> 32:37.254
Trust me, you wouldn't like
the counter.

32:37.256 --> 32:40.090
I can tell
you things.

32:40.092 --> 32:42.192
You going to tell me
about parking tickets?

32:42.194 --> 32:43.877
Yours is already punched.

32:43.878 --> 32:45.561
We know all about
Carnegie Collections.

32:47.266 --> 32:48.565
I got a lot of names.

32:48.567 --> 32:52.035
I'll see you in court.

33:00.145 --> 33:02.245
I'm not talking
G-4s here.

33:02.247 --> 33:04.047
These are your basic
elected officials

33:04.049 --> 33:07.250
and a deputy
police commander.

33:08.654 --> 33:12.189
Don't have him
make me call security.

33:12.191 --> 33:13.590
Come on, Tony.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.325
There is no way

33:15.327 --> 33:18.595
that I am going down
alone behind this.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.464
Now, what do you want?

33:20.466 --> 33:22.032
Want? I want it all.

33:22.034 --> 33:23.333
You testify--
give names, dates, amounts.

33:23.335 --> 33:26.336
You flush all those
true-blue public officials.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.205
And that gets me a walk?

33:28.207 --> 33:31.208
The only way you walk is you say
who gave the order.

33:36.148 --> 33:38.648
You know
I can't do that.

33:38.650 --> 33:42.085
No Masucci, no free lunch.

33:42.087 --> 33:43.553
But the public officials
could lead to a plea

33:43.555 --> 33:45.555
of let's say... assault?

33:45.557 --> 33:49.059
Let's say
voluntary manslaughter.

33:49.061 --> 33:50.360
Let's say involuntary.

33:50.362 --> 33:51.695
Then he wears a wire.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.363
SCALISI:
What, are you crazy?

33:53.365 --> 33:55.165
They know I've been popped;
they'll smell it.

33:55.167 --> 33:56.700
You let me worry about that.

33:58.604 --> 34:00.604
What kind
of sentencing recommendation?

34:00.606 --> 34:03.507
Depends on what's on the tape.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.644
Tick-tock, gentlemen.

34:19.358 --> 34:20.690
Write it up.

34:24.229 --> 34:27.731
The guy had arteries
the diameter of capillaries.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.100
So with the traumatic
loss of six units of blood

34:30.102 --> 34:31.401
there was a
causative connection

34:31.403 --> 34:33.303
between the assault
and the coronary?

34:33.305 --> 34:35.172
Oh, come on, guys,
you don't want to ask me that--

34:35.174 --> 34:36.573
"causative connection"?

34:36.575 --> 34:38.141
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute.

34:38.143 --> 34:39.676
Mr. Halsey
had a regular physician,

34:39.678 --> 34:41.511
didn't he, Dr. Goldberg?
Yes, he did.

34:41.513 --> 34:43.680
And he described Halsey as being
in good health.
Uh-huh.

34:43.682 --> 34:45.282
He was alive a week ago,
correct?

34:45.284 --> 34:46.349
Far as I could tell.

34:46.351 --> 34:48.018
And then, somebody
cut his throat

34:48.019 --> 34:49.686
with a straight razor,
severing an artery
in his vocal cords.

34:49.688 --> 34:52.322
As well as other
connective tissue.

34:52.324 --> 34:54.324
And now,
Mr. Halsey is dead?

34:54.326 --> 34:55.625
Yes, that's correct.

34:55.627 --> 34:58.261
Thank you, Dr. Goldberg.

35:01.633 --> 35:05.368
It's neat, it's clean, it's
inter-agency cooperation.

35:05.370 --> 35:07.504
and we may get a murder-
for-hire conspiracy.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.306
while you get another
nail for your RICO...

35:09.308 --> 35:11.741
How did I get so lucky?

35:11.743 --> 35:13.176
A high-level cop is involved.

35:13.178 --> 35:14.578
I can't this
through the P.D.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.646
The D.A. know about this?

35:16.648 --> 35:18.748
It has his
full approval.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.650
We go to trial first.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.152
You want to win your RICO?

35:22.154 --> 35:23.653
You go in with
one of the five counts

35:23.655 --> 35:25.655
having already been proven
in state court.

35:30.596 --> 35:31.761
What do you need?

35:31.763 --> 35:34.197
An FBI surveillance team.

35:36.702 --> 35:39.536
Get me Jackson at the bureau.

35:39.538 --> 35:41.404
All right,
let me see if I've got this.

35:41.406 --> 35:43.540
Halsey's been called
before the grand jury.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.675
Big names figure
he's going to name them,

35:45.677 --> 35:46.710
give the contract
to Scalisi.

35:46.712 --> 35:48.578
But Scalisi screwed up.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.679
The black kids come along.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.581
We got lucky; they
came up with I.D.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.216
So why are you kicking?

35:53.218 --> 35:54.584
I told you,
it's a weak case.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.253
It's all circumstantial,

35:56.255 --> 35:58.388
and no choirboys
as witnesses for
the prosecution.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.624
Spare me the waltz,
all right?

36:00.626 --> 36:03.393
This is all off the record
until after an indictment.

36:03.395 --> 36:05.762
But I get an exclusive
on the arrest.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.664
I can't promise
you that.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.499
Sure you can.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.234
You get an exclusive

36:11.236 --> 36:14.771
on the highest-ranking
defendant's arrest site.

36:14.773 --> 36:17.240
Will you run it?

36:19.711 --> 36:22.746
"Assistant District Attorney
Benjamin Stone stated

36:22.748 --> 36:26.449
"that his office did not feel
that Scalisi's causative role

36:26.451 --> 36:28.251
"in Halsey's death
could be proven

36:28.253 --> 36:30.353
beyond a reasonable doubt."

36:30.355 --> 36:32.589
a tad doctrinaire,
but not too bad.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.724
Scalisi comes out
smelling like a rose.

36:34.726 --> 36:37.561
So long as they buy
he held his mud.

36:37.563 --> 36:40.463
Jefferson called me
for a status report.

36:40.465 --> 36:42.599
You told him about
this case?

36:42.601 --> 36:44.234
I had to--
he would have been suspicious

36:44.236 --> 36:46.336
if I didn't talk to him.

36:46.338 --> 36:49.472
I gave him the "we had
to let Scalisi walk" rap.

36:49.474 --> 36:50.740
How did he take it?

36:50.742 --> 36:52.742
He was absolutely furious.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.745
I'm sure it was an
Oscar performance.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.781
You're certain
he's guilty, right?

36:57.783 --> 37:01.418
I'm not certain,
I'm positive!

37:01.420 --> 37:03.787
Now, you take her
through her testimony?

37:03.789 --> 37:05.422
She's still upset

37:05.424 --> 37:06.790
about not having
a lawyer with her.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.858
Did you explain to her
how the grand jury works?

37:08.860 --> 37:10.627
No lawyer unless
you're a defendant

37:10.629 --> 37:12.562
and we need her testimony
to get a wiretap?

37:12.564 --> 37:14.464
She understands.

37:14.465 --> 37:16.365
She's not happy about
it, but she gets it.
All right.

37:19.738 --> 37:22.405
STONE:
And did Charles Halsey
tell you of other officials

37:22.407 --> 37:24.541
who were involved in
this conspiracy to award

37:24.543 --> 37:27.477
the traffic violation bureau's
collection contract

37:27.479 --> 37:30.780
to Carnegie Collections?

37:30.782 --> 37:32.782
HESLIN:
Well, he mentioned people
that I knew

37:32.784 --> 37:34.784
as well as people
that I had never heard of.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.720
Which people
that you knew personally?

37:36.722 --> 37:40.523
Anthony Scalisi
and William Jefferson.

37:40.525 --> 37:43.693
And did he tell you
the amount of money involved?

37:43.695 --> 37:45.545
He said

37:45.546 --> 37:47.396
that there was over $1 million
available

37:47.399 --> 37:49.799
to pay off city officials
per year.

37:49.801 --> 37:53.336
(<i> elevator bell dings</i> )

37:53.338 --> 37:54.738
See who your
client drew?

37:54.740 --> 37:56.740
No, I haven't seen
the calendar.

37:56.742 --> 37:58.541
"Let 'Em Walk" Falk.

37:58.543 --> 38:00.677
Hey, I didn't want him to plead;
it was his own decision.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.412
Anyway,
he got the call.

38:02.414 --> 38:03.680
From who?

38:03.682 --> 38:05.515
Scalisi wants it
to be a surprise.

38:05.517 --> 38:07.684
This isn't a
parlor game, Eddie.

38:07.686 --> 38:09.386
He's worried somebody
might not show up,

38:09.388 --> 38:10.420
and you'll think
he's lying.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.555
Where's the meet?

38:12.557 --> 38:13.690
Cafe Bruxelles.

38:13.692 --> 38:14.691
When?

38:14.693 --> 38:17.427
Tomorrow night, 8:00.

38:17.429 --> 38:20.430
Bring him to the bureau
at 6:00.

38:20.432 --> 38:22.565
You know who's coming?

38:22.567 --> 38:23.767
Mm-hmm.

38:25.704 --> 38:27.437
Bad?

38:27.439 --> 38:31.508
I hope you don't have
any political aspirations.

38:33.979 --> 38:36.646
Just make sure
he's on time.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.586
I'll start with you
taking them through the arrest

38:43.588 --> 38:44.821
of Lewis and Jackson.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.589
Let Max do Scalisi.

38:46.591 --> 38:48.725
How did you let
those kids plead?

38:48.727 --> 38:50.960
Possession of stolen
property, six months.

38:50.962 --> 38:53.430
You going to be able
to nail Jefferson

38:53.432 --> 38:54.631
for anything worse?

38:54.633 --> 38:57.734
STONE:
Looks like it.

38:57.736 --> 39:00.737
What goes around
comes around.

39:00.739 --> 39:03.473
If these guys smell
anything hinky, they're
going to clam up.

39:03.475 --> 39:04.774
So just be cool--
you beat the system.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.776
You told the cops
to shine it on.

39:06.778 --> 39:09.446
McCORMACK:
Maybe you want to tell us
who's coming to this party now?

39:09.448 --> 39:12.615
Hey, didn't anybody
tell him the deal?

39:12.617 --> 39:14.384
Whoever comes, comes.

39:14.386 --> 39:15.752
These guys are going
to hang themselves.

39:15.754 --> 39:17.270
I ain't ratting on them.

39:17.271 --> 39:18.787
But I'll tell you who
ain't coming: Masucci.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.924
There is no way
I give up my boss.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.692
Hold your water, Tony.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.894
We wouldn't want you
to short yourself out.

39:24.896 --> 39:27.030
Just make sure one
of the principals

39:27.032 --> 39:29.833
implicates himself.
Right, right, right.

39:36.541 --> 39:38.792
STONE:
We've gone through
their phone records.

39:38.793 --> 39:41.044
Halsey's talking to Scalisi and
Jefferson 10-15 times a week.

39:41.046 --> 39:44.714
Conti even called Jefferson
when he was on a police junket

39:44.716 --> 39:45.915
to Tokyo.
McCORMACK:
Whoa, whoa.

39:45.917 --> 39:48.518
Scalisi and Halsey
I understand,

39:48.520 --> 39:49.786
but why Jefferson?

39:49.788 --> 39:51.921
He's a deputy commander
and police handle traffic,

39:51.923 --> 39:53.623
which includes parking.
ROBINETTE:
Look at that.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.759
Do you believe these guys?

39:55.761 --> 39:58.595
McCORMACK:
Damn! Limo's got a New York City
shield on the bumper.

40:07.005 --> 40:09.506
STONE:
Bingo.

40:09.508 --> 40:10.940
McCORMACK:
Who is it?

40:10.942 --> 40:13.476
STONE:
Borough President Conti's
in front,

40:13.478 --> 40:15.779
that guy in the middle
is Jefferson,

40:15.781 --> 40:18.715
and the one in the blazer
is Councilman Van Damme.

40:18.717 --> 40:21.851
(<i> whistling</i> )
Ain't politics great?

40:28.560 --> 40:29.959
CONTI (<i> over speaker</i> ):
I was worried
it would come up

40:29.961 --> 40:33.596
at the mayor's press
conference last week.

40:33.598 --> 40:37.967
JEFFERSON:
The commissioner was
asking about it every day.

40:37.969 --> 40:39.869
This has been
a rough few weeks

40:39.871 --> 40:42.105
on all of us,
and the...

40:42.107 --> 40:45.909
The DA's decision
is extremely gratifying.

40:45.911 --> 40:49.646
I'd like to propose
a toast.

40:49.648 --> 40:50.847
To Tony Scalisi.

40:50.849 --> 40:52.365
JEFFERSON:
Here, here.

40:52.366 --> 40:53.882
CONTI:
Who knows how to be
a stand-up guy.

40:53.885 --> 40:55.852
That's about as damning
as a rotary club meeting.

40:55.854 --> 40:58.855
Shh, shh.

40:58.857 --> 41:03.793
Tony... we don't
want you to think

41:03.795 --> 41:07.664
that we're not very grateful
for everything you've done.

41:07.666 --> 41:09.866
SCALISI:
Hey, what are friends for?

41:09.868 --> 41:11.601
VAN DAMME:
Maybe we should get you

41:11.603 --> 41:14.070
to take care of that worm Lasco,
too, huh, Tony.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.672
Yeah, half the politicians.
AGENT:
God almighty...

41:15.674 --> 41:17.507
AGENT 2:
What's the problem?
It's Greco.

41:17.509 --> 41:18.608
Who is he?

41:18.610 --> 41:19.676
McCORMACK:
One of Masucci's mechanics.

41:19.678 --> 41:21.656
He usually eats in the bar.

41:21.657 --> 41:23.635
What do you want to do?
STONE:
Let it play.

41:23.636 --> 41:25.614
VAN DAMME:
...have to send you right
to the hospital to do some...

41:25.617 --> 41:27.267
"additional surgery."

41:27.268 --> 41:28.918
I thought the jerk
was never going to croak.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.019
(<i> laughter</i> )

41:30.021 --> 41:31.821
JEFFERSON:
These things take time.

41:31.823 --> 41:34.157
VAN DAMME:
Tony, you know if there's
ever anything you need

41:34.159 --> 41:36.860
from us...
Come on.

41:36.862 --> 41:38.127
He's probably just going in
for dinner...

41:38.129 --> 41:39.896
Wait, he's going
to incriminate himself.

41:39.898 --> 41:42.065
I want you
to have this.

41:46.171 --> 41:49.739
VAN DAMME:
It's nice to know we're all
in the same boat together.

41:49.741 --> 41:51.774
So who contributed?

41:51.776 --> 41:54.043
You really want to know?

41:54.045 --> 41:55.778
Absolutely.

41:55.780 --> 41:59.716
Me, Jefferson,
Van Damme.

41:59.718 --> 42:00.783
That's it--
we got it.

42:00.785 --> 42:01.951
Tell the agents
in the restaurant.

42:01.953 --> 42:03.887
They're not
wearing radios.
What?!

42:03.889 --> 42:05.955
You can't hide the wires.
This guy's not going
to the bar.

42:05.957 --> 42:07.657
Oh, my God!

42:14.165 --> 42:16.599
(<i> car horn honking</i> )

42:17.802 --> 42:19.702
(<i> gunshot</i> )

42:19.704 --> 42:20.770
(<i> screaming</i> )

42:20.772 --> 42:22.705
Freeze, Greco!

42:22.707 --> 42:24.040
(<i> gunfire</i> )

42:39.925 --> 42:41.824
Don't say anything.

42:41.826 --> 42:43.059
Not a word!

42:43.061 --> 42:44.861
Wait for your lawyer.

42:54.773 --> 42:57.740
STONE:
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

42:57.742 --> 42:59.809
in the coming weeks,

42:59.811 --> 43:02.178
you will hear
how an investigation

43:02.180 --> 43:05.682
of what seemed to be
a common mugging

43:05.684 --> 43:09.018
uncovered a conspiracy
at the highest levels

43:09.020 --> 43:11.020
of city government--

43:11.022 --> 43:15.858
a conspiracy that led
to three violent deaths.

43:15.860 --> 43:18.127
You will learn how these men

43:18.129 --> 43:21.864
driven by
the basest kind of greed

43:21.866 --> 43:23.866
violated their public trust

43:23.868 --> 43:26.970
and conspired
with a member of organized crime

43:26.972 --> 43:29.973
to murder
another public official.

43:34.145 --> 43:35.878
I ask you

43:35.880 --> 43:39.816
to weigh all the evidence
that is presented.

43:39.818 --> 43:41.818
It is my responsibility

43:41.820 --> 43:45.755
to show you their crimes.

43:45.757 --> 43:48.758
It is your responsibility...

43:48.760 --> 43:48.791
...to see
that justice is done.
