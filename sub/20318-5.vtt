00:20.920 --> 00:22.797
You see that guy?
That guy was wearing a bunny suit.

00:22.880 --> 00:27.670
Hey, what rhymes with "ambulance"?
Thinking "malevolence."

00:28.120 --> 00:31.476
"My hockey pants."
-How about "annoyance"?

00:31.560 --> 00:34.677
How about "assemblance"?
-That's not a word.

00:34.760 --> 00:38.070
Like, "An assemblance of people."
That's a word. That's good enough.

00:38.160 --> 00:39.991
Wait, so you really think that
saving Young Thunda's life

00:40.080 --> 00:42.275
is going to help your music career?
-Hey, it couldn't hurt.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.590
I mean, Young Thunda's last
album sold a million copies,

00:44.680 --> 00:45.999
another million in ring tones.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.436
And after our swift response to his
party-related mishap tonight, you know,

00:49.520 --> 00:52.273
if I slip him my demo, he's got to listen
to it. It's the code of the streets.

00:52.360 --> 00:53.998
Seriously! How hard could
it be to write rap lyrics?

00:54.080 --> 00:56.071
Look, I already got a bunch here.
This is gold.

00:56.160 --> 00:59.596
Ah, you're in my ambulance
My love to you will advance

01:04.080 --> 01:05.911
Oz, turn left up here.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.515
What?

01:13.520 --> 01:17.229
Turn left up here! Right here.
Right here, turn left!

01:31.440 --> 01:34.716
It's okay. Hey. Hey, hey!
-Get off me, man.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.234
Where you going?
Where you gonna go?

01:37.320 --> 01:39.834
Bowling, I don't know.
-Let me take you to the hospital.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.751
Come here!
-I'm fine!

01:43.000 --> 01:45.195
Do you want to get over here?

01:56.080 --> 02:00.835
Man, I don't want to wait 10 hours. I'm fine.
-You're my favourite kind of patient, dude.

02:00.920 --> 02:05.038
Hey, Oz, you mind watching this kid?
AII right, if he moves, you shoot him.

02:05.120 --> 02:08.556
Okay.
-It's a zoo out there.

02:08.639 --> 02:10.073
Yeah, and that's just the staff.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.674
Hey, Liv, can you prioritise us,
you know, so we can get back out there?

02:12.760 --> 02:15.354
What have you got?
-We have this kid.

02:16.040 --> 02:19.555
These other kids were trying to drown him,
and then he fainted, he passed out.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.234
I got to get a neurologist in
for someone whose brains are...

02:22.320 --> 02:23.799
Never mind. You don't want to know.

02:23.880 --> 02:26.030
We tried to check him out in the rig,
but he was totally resistant.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.712
Just give us five minutes,
we can let him loose.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.439
I'II do what I can. Dr Hamilton!

02:35.400 --> 02:36.753
Hey! That's Young Thunda.

02:37.960 --> 02:40.030
Yo! Take it to the back, take it to the back

02:40.120 --> 02:44.159
We saved his life tonight.
I'm going to go see how he's doing.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.990
Hey, hey, Thunda, all right! Give him
some room, people, now. Come on, now.

02:49.080 --> 02:51.230
I could just scoop them all.

02:58.680 --> 03:01.114
I'd hate to see those go missing.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.200
I need some fresh air.
-Yeah, you know what? That's a good idea.

03:09.280 --> 03:13.398
I could use some fresh air, too.
I hate the smell of hospitals.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.278
You're not going to let
me out of here, are you?

03:16.360 --> 03:17.429
No.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.234
You want me to call your folks for you?
-I lost their number.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.917
So, why were those kids beating you up?
-What?

03:34.520 --> 03:36.238
No, they're just my friends,
fooling around.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.868
The doctors are going to wonder
where you got those bruises.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.109
Fell.

03:42.880 --> 03:46.111
No, those bruises don't Iook like you fell.
It looks Iike you were defending yourself.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.760
They teach you that in medic school?
-No.

03:48.840 --> 03:51.513
I've had to defend
myself once or twice.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.239
There was this one time,
I was at this intake facility,

03:54.320 --> 03:56.788
was waiting for a
new foster family.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.552
You're a kennel kid?

03:58.640 --> 04:01.757
Pretty much a lifer.
-What'd you do?

04:02.480 --> 04:06.871
I was stupid, man. There was this bike.
I thought it was common property.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.797
Of course, the biggest kid owned it.
I took it for a little spin.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.791
That'll do it.
-Yeah.

04:13.360 --> 04:16.317
He got his two friends to hold me down.
They started waling on my belly.

04:18.079 --> 04:19.593
Toby.
-Hey, John.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.875
I'll get that book for you.
I'm gonna leave it in your locker later.

04:21.959 --> 04:23.279
Is that cool?
-No problem.

04:23.360 --> 04:24.554
Thanks, man.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.752
Hey. You see a kid run by?

04:36.840 --> 04:40.310
You got a runner. Description?
-Street kid named Daniel.

04:40.400 --> 04:44.518
And?
-And he's a boy.

04:46.280 --> 04:48.840
So are half the other
kids in the city.

04:48.920 --> 04:52.515
Okay. He's short for his age.
He's, Iike, 5'4". Short, dark hair.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.512
That just blows the case
wide open, doesn't it?

04:55.600 --> 04:58.433
I think he might have
been wearing jeans.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.078
So, what did he do?
-Nothing.

05:00.160 --> 05:03.118
Okay, so let me get this straight.
You got a teenage boy

05:03.200 --> 05:07.239
whose first name is Daniel, short,
dark hair, who's done nothing?

05:08.040 --> 05:09.473
Yeah. You're good.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.552
I tell you what, I'm going to put it
on the most wanted list, all right?

05:12.640 --> 05:14.232
Have a good day.

05:51.480 --> 05:55.678
Dude, I need the demo by the weekend.
So, get the software off the Internet.

05:55.760 --> 05:58.593
Listen! When you're my tour DJ
and we're selling out arenas,

05:58.680 --> 06:00.955
no one's going to care you
failed your driver's ed test.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.270
I don't care what Mom says. Ma!

06:03.360 --> 06:08.832
Yes. Yes, a driver's licence is important.
Yes, I will be at dinner on Saturday.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.832
Bye-bye. Tell me you
have turntables.

06:13.760 --> 06:14.829
Toby.
-What?

06:14.920 --> 06:16.558
Are you coming to Young
Thunda's party with me?

06:16.640 --> 06:18.198
I don't know.
I'm still thinking about it.

06:18.280 --> 06:20.191
If I don't roll with a deep crew,

06:20.280 --> 06:23.078
Young Thunda's going to think
I'm a wannabe gangster type.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.390
Oz, you are a wannabe gangster.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.635
Hate to break it to you, man.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.198
So, why did that kid bolt?

06:33.280 --> 06:34.713
Could be his way of saying,
"Leave me alone."

06:34.800 --> 06:36.199
But you saw what they
were doing to him.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.479
I mean, they could've killed him.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.949
Toby, kids do stupid things.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.678
If he doesn't want your help,
he doesn't want your help.

06:44.760 --> 06:47.593
Well, he doesn't want it,
but he needs it.

06:52.560 --> 06:53.709
Could you just pull
over here for a minute?

06:53.800 --> 06:55.552
What?
-Just pull over.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.630
Hey, you kids know where I can find Daniel?

07:09.720 --> 07:11.711
A kid named Daniel?

07:12.920 --> 07:15.514
Okay. All right.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.909
Great.
-They don't trust uniforms.

07:21.760 --> 07:24.433
I'm looking for a kid named Daniel.
-Any particular reason?

07:24.520 --> 07:26.351
Not that I'd help
you if you had one.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.749
Would you help me if I had one?

07:29.520 --> 07:32.637
Let's just say I'm not the Lost and Found.
-Hey, listen.

07:32.720 --> 07:36.030
We picked him up last night.
He was worked over pretty good.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.838
And if he wants to
file a police report...

07:37.920 --> 07:39.592
What? Give you a call?

07:39.680 --> 07:42.433
Get him to call
Detective Charlie Marks.

07:42.760 --> 07:46.673
Thanks. But I can already tell you this
kid's not going to want to file charges.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.239
Keep the card.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.034
But you may want to try
around College and Bathurst.

07:56.120 --> 07:58.714
Lose the uniform.
-Thank you.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.870
AII right, get out of here.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.588
Who is he?
-I don't know!

09:15.680 --> 09:17.193
He's looking for you.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.191
You screw up again and Ramone's gonna...
-Hey.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.872
Go ahead, man. Ramone's gonna what?

09:20.960 --> 09:23.349
You follow me here?
-That's the guy?

09:23.440 --> 09:26.671
It's just the paramedic from the other day.
-Yeah? Why's he looking for you?

09:26.760 --> 09:28.113
I don't know. Ask him.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.192
What the hell do you want?
-That's none of your business, man.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.797
Yeah, what do you want?

09:36.160 --> 09:38.276
Look, I just want to talk.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.913
AII right? Just give us a minute.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.754
Why don't you give me a reason?
-Okay, you want a reason?

09:44.840 --> 09:45.989
How about six months for assault?

09:46.080 --> 09:48.071
That's what you get for beating
the crap out of a kid that age.

09:48.160 --> 09:50.037
In front of witnesses, no Iess.
That's kind of stupid, man.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.793
How old are you? 17? What are you? 18?

09:52.880 --> 09:54.074
Don't worry, you're not
going to go to juvie,

09:54.160 --> 09:55.434
you'll go to
Dorchester or Kingston.

09:55.520 --> 09:59.479
That's pretty cool, huh?
You're a tough guy. You can handle it.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.074
Daniel.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.990
Hey, Danny, don't say nothing.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.469
Listen, man, you gotta
get yourself checked out.

10:18.560 --> 10:20.949
I'm fine.
-I don't think you are.

10:21.640 --> 10:25.030
I don't think you're meant
for the streets, Daniel.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.396
So, if you foster Daniel,
just $1 a day

10:27.480 --> 10:29.038
can provide him with the
food and medicine he needs.

10:29.120 --> 10:32.829
AII right, okay, so foster care isn't
perfect, all right? But it's safe.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.718
What are you? Some poster boy
for the lost and left behind?

10:35.800 --> 10:37.836
Was home really that bad?

10:39.720 --> 10:42.439
We can get you some help.
-I'm fine. I can take care of myself.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.636
Yeah, what? What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

10:44.720 --> 10:46.790
You gonna steal car radios?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.639
Or are you more interested in pharmacies?
-Get bent.

10:54.720 --> 10:58.349
Come on, man. What about Ramone?

10:58.440 --> 11:00.749
What about Ramone?
-Is he making you do this?

11:00.840 --> 11:03.115
'Cause if he is,
you gotta tell the cops.

11:03.800 --> 11:05.438
If you don't do it, you're dead.

11:05.520 --> 11:08.273
I'm with you, Ramone.
-You talk, you're dead.

11:08.480 --> 11:10.038
Look, I'm not telling
anybody anything.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.793
Look, Daniel, what are
you running from, man?

11:22.120 --> 11:24.759
Who's Lisa Greyson?
-What?

11:29.680 --> 11:31.511
What did you do to her?

11:31.600 --> 11:33.397
Look, I don't know what
you're talking about.

11:33.480 --> 11:35.835
Just get the hell out of my way.

11:48.440 --> 11:52.513
You know, Danny. I think it's about time
you and I paid Ramone a little visit.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.238
What? I didn't do nothing!

11:59.040 --> 12:00.155
Hey!
-How are you doing?

12:00.240 --> 12:02.834
Thanks. Oh, a knife wound.

12:02.920 --> 12:06.037
Guy had one too many mai tais at a family
barbecue, ended up stabbing himself.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.429
How's he doing?
-Oh, he's fine.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.988
I don't think the suckling pig
is going to press any charges.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.274
They rarely do.

12:13.480 --> 12:16.950
Do you remember that kid who ran away?
-The one with the jeans?

12:17.040 --> 12:20.112
Yeah. Daniel. I found him.
-Oh, you did?

12:21.000 --> 12:24.549
Yeah. I think he's in trouble.
-What kind of trouble?

12:24.640 --> 12:27.837
Well, there's this guy named Ramone,
and I think he's boosting for him.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.639
Ramone Vazquez?
-I don't know his last name.

12:30.720 --> 12:32.870
Vazquez. We've been on him
now for a couple of years.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.032
He's got a rap sheet that runs like
an encyclopaedia of dysfunction.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.189
Drugs, assault.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.157
Break and enter?
-Oh, yeah. Big time.

12:39.240 --> 12:40.912
AIthough, the past year,
he's been pretty quiet.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.356
I think he's been watching his back.
-Or he's got someone else doing it for him.

12:44.440 --> 12:45.589
Sounds like Ramone.

12:45.680 --> 12:49.593
Well, I think that this Daniel kid might
be involved in some drugstore robberies.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.318
He tell you that?
-No, not exactly,

12:51.400 --> 12:53.834
but I think he's caught up in
something that he can't get out of.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.478
Okay, well,
where can I find this kid?

12:55.560 --> 12:58.711
You know what, actually, I should
probably find him first and talk to him.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.712
Okay. Well, please be careful.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.835
You again? What, are you moving in?

13:15.920 --> 13:19.435
Yeah, I'm thinking about it. See, I thought
you'd be more into colouring books.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.192
Danny's not here.

13:22.520 --> 13:24.033
Just go away.

13:28.200 --> 13:32.352
All right. Just tell Daniel I stopped by.
-I'II get right on that.

13:36.680 --> 13:41.310
You know, Danny, you're beginning
to get a Iittle bit too popular.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.356
Hey, there.
-You again?

13:55.280 --> 13:57.430
Charlie Marks says you're a freak.
-She did?

13:57.520 --> 14:00.990
Didn't think I was going to check you out?
-Well...

14:01.080 --> 14:03.514
Cuz, get your feet off the couch.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.839
She also said that you're
a freak I can trust.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.434
She did?
-So, who are you looking for now?

14:14.520 --> 14:16.158
I'm looking for Lisa Greyson.

14:18.640 --> 14:19.709
Yeah, sweet kid.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.193
She's a runaway.

14:22.920 --> 14:25.957
She had some issues and I could never
get her to tell me what was wrong.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.600
You know where she is now?
-Home, I hope.

14:28.680 --> 14:30.750
Where's that?
-White Rock, BC.

14:31.840 --> 14:35.435
I broke my own cardinal rule
and bought her a bus ticket.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.596
She wasn't built for the streets.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.989
Book before he talks to you.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.548
Come on. Get out of here.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.399
Thank you.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.795
Hello, Ramone.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.636
New digs, huh?
-You know what?

15:12.720 --> 15:16.759
Midtown Bistro, they went and changed chefs
on me, so I like the food here better.

15:16.840 --> 15:20.116
Funny how 20 bucks will buy
you a forwarding address.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.236
Where do I know you from?

15:25.200 --> 15:26.792
What can I do for you, Officer?

15:26.880 --> 15:30.156
Tell me, what do you know about
this plague of drugstore break-ins?

15:30.240 --> 15:31.639
I'm shocked.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.671
Come on, Ramone.
B&E are your speciality,

15:36.760 --> 15:40.355
and you've got a soft spot for
pharmaceutical trades, don't you?

15:40.440 --> 15:42.237
You can try past tense, all right?

15:42.320 --> 15:43.355
What do you want me to say?

15:43.440 --> 15:46.989
I was an exuberant child and I had
no place to channel my energy.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.672
Where are you getting
your protein from, Ramone?

15:48.760 --> 15:51.957
I'm in demolitions.
-You like destroying things?

15:53.920 --> 15:55.114
Is there a point to this?

15:55.200 --> 15:59.478
Word on the street is that you're
behind all these pharmacy break-ins.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.269
Is that so?

16:02.360 --> 16:03.554
And you're getting the
kids to hit them for you.

16:03.640 --> 16:06.598
Yeah. You have a vivid imagination.

16:06.680 --> 16:10.070
Is this the reason why
you're in my face right now?

16:10.160 --> 16:13.709
Well, if you say you had
nothing to do with it,

16:13.800 --> 16:16.837
you don't mind if I keep
my eye on you, do you?

16:19.400 --> 16:21.630
But you know? These wings?

16:23.160 --> 16:24.559
Weak.
-Yeah.

16:36.360 --> 16:37.713
Come here.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.551
Looks like you were right.

16:42.640 --> 16:44.835
Man, I told you.
Danny narced us out.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.593
Where's he at now?
-He's back at the stoop.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.511
You want me to go fetch him?
-No, no.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.909
'Cause I'm going to take care of it
personally when the time is right.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.991
Don't tell him anything.

17:07.599 --> 17:08.874
Hey, Cuz!

17:33.560 --> 17:35.391
What is with this guy?

17:36.400 --> 17:40.234
Hey, Cuz! I just want to
make sure Lisa's all right.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.876
Too late for her.

17:45.360 --> 17:46.998
Is she in danger?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.956
Lisa's dead,
understand? I killed her.

17:52.920 --> 17:54.638
I killed her.

18:09.960 --> 18:13.032
Come on, man. We're on duty.
We can't hit every shop on Queen.

18:13.120 --> 18:16.271
Ah, they know where we are.
They can hit me on my pager.

18:16.360 --> 18:20.478
AII right, now, it's all about the shoes,
from what I understand.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.079
Nice!

18:26.080 --> 18:28.548
So, that flash you had.
Did you sleep on it?

18:28.640 --> 18:31.677
That's the problem, I didn't sleep at all.
I was thinking about it all night Iong.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.432
So, you really think
this kid's a killer, huh?

18:35.480 --> 18:37.550
Come on, man! No, I don't.

18:37.640 --> 18:41.235
But you had that flash
that said he killed Lisa.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.835
Yeah, well, that's just the thing.
He said he killed her.

18:45.160 --> 18:48.152
There's a difference.
-Not if he killed her.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.673
Does he look like a killer to you?
-That's what they say about all killers.

18:51.760 --> 18:52.829
"He was so nice and quiet.

18:52.920 --> 18:56.356
"Who knew he liked to make flower
pots out of mailman skulls?"

18:56.440 --> 18:57.873
You going to tell Detective
Delicious about this?

18:57.960 --> 18:59.279
Who, Charlie?
-Yeah.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.828
Yeah, what am I going to tell her?
"Hey, Charlie,

19:01.920 --> 19:05.469
"got no evidence, I got no reliable source.
You going to help?"

19:05.560 --> 19:07.676
I'd go for the red, by the way.
-You think the red?

19:07.760 --> 19:11.275
Why are you so desperate to
believe this kid is innocent?

19:11.360 --> 19:14.670
Well, when I was 15, I was in
this foster family from hell,

19:14.760 --> 19:18.230
so I took off. I was on the
streets for three months.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.119
I get it, man. You gotta say
things to protect yourself.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.236
You ever claim you killed
someone to protect yourself?

19:24.320 --> 19:26.550
Well, no, but it's the same idea.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.995
Are you trying to convince me,
or yourself?

19:29.080 --> 19:32.152
So, this kid reminds you of yourself,
or something equally movie-of-the-week,

19:32.240 --> 19:35.630
but it's like I put down
on this sick new track, yo.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.632
Your what? Your... Ridiculous.
-Some kids are just born bad.

19:39.240 --> 19:42.038
To wit. Par exemple.

19:42.120 --> 19:46.238
Hey, Ellen said she
bought Lisa a ticket home.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.469
Maybe she went home.

19:47.560 --> 19:52.270
Okay, well, check it out. If she's not there...
-I'll tell Charlie everything.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.518
Hey, is Lisa there?

20:08.800 --> 20:10.631
Sorry to bother you.

20:11.280 --> 20:15.796
So, there's no Lisa?
You're sure? Hello?

20:16.200 --> 20:19.476
No, I don't want any free samples, please.
I know I called you.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.278
Sorry for calling.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.194
Are there any relatives
by that name?

20:27.240 --> 20:31.074
She's a teenager. Okay, thank you.
I'm sorry to bother you.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.991
Hello, is Lisa there?

20:34.080 --> 20:36.753
Who is this?
-This is Toby Logan.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.717
I'm a paramedic in Toronto.

20:40.880 --> 20:43.952
Is Lisa all right?
Did something happen to her?

20:45.360 --> 20:46.634
No.

20:46.720 --> 20:49.553
Are you Lisa Greyson's mother?
-Yes.

20:52.280 --> 20:57.195
Margaret Greyson. Please, I'm her mother.
Tell me if something's happened to her.

20:58.080 --> 21:01.789
No, no. I mean, I don't know.

21:06.240 --> 21:10.392
I don't understand.
Why are you calling here?

21:12.080 --> 21:15.675
Do you know my daughter?
-No. No.

21:16.560 --> 21:19.597
I just wanted to call to...

21:21.200 --> 21:24.317
This conversation is over. Goodbye.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.877
Who's Lisa Greyson?

21:41.680 --> 21:43.910
Your name is Toby. Say it.
-Toby.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.673
Toby Logan. Say it again.
-Toby Logan.

21:47.320 --> 21:50.278
That's the only name
you've ever had, okay?

22:02.360 --> 22:06.035
Is that tight? It's tight,
right?

22:07.400 --> 22:09.391
What?
-Mr Bey!

22:10.400 --> 22:12.994
Mr Bey, you got
yourself a package here.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.354
My demos.

22:18.640 --> 22:20.551
It's my demos. Thank you.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.312
Would you please?

22:24.120 --> 22:27.749
Oh, baby! There you go. Oh, man.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.035
Hey, Les, this could be worth
something one day. Enjoy.

22:30.120 --> 22:31.473
"I'm Gonna Thrill Again. "

22:31.560 --> 22:33.949
Yeah. You know, "Thrill again."
It's like, "Kill again."

22:34.040 --> 22:36.508
It's a play on words.
Hey, sir, you want one of my demos?

22:40.280 --> 22:42.840
Hello? You're mad.

22:44.560 --> 22:48.235
Right now? Okay, I'm on my way.

22:49.880 --> 22:52.713
I see your little shadow's here again.
-I invited him.

22:53.920 --> 22:54.955
What is it this time?

22:55.040 --> 22:57.600
I'm working a case, and Toby
happens to be involved in it.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.193
Happens to be involved?

22:59.280 --> 23:03.159
Or maybe it's more that he just put himself right
in the middle of it, like he always does?

23:03.240 --> 23:07.438
What difference does it make? I mean,
if he's got information, I'm gonna use it.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.636
Right.
-Anything else?

23:10.480 --> 23:11.913
No.

23:12.280 --> 23:13.429
Hey, there.

23:13.520 --> 23:16.637
I was just coming to get you.
-Good. Well, I saved you the trouble.

23:16.720 --> 23:17.789
So, I'm at the front desk

23:17.880 --> 23:20.917
and another detective is talking
about some woman from White Rock, BC,

23:21.000 --> 23:24.197
who got a prank call from
some clown named Toby Logan.

23:24.280 --> 23:27.272
Okay, it wasn't a prank call.
-Thank you.

23:27.360 --> 23:28.793
She's here?
-Yeah.

23:28.880 --> 23:30.871
In the conference room.

23:36.120 --> 23:38.236
Tell me about her daughter.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.959
Okay, I think that Daniel might
have killed her daughter.

23:41.040 --> 23:42.314
Do you have any solid evidence

23:42.400 --> 23:43.549
or proof of this?
-No.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.119
Well, you can't go in
there and tell her that.

23:45.200 --> 23:48.954
What am I supposed to say?
-Margaret, this is Toby Logan.

23:49.840 --> 23:50.989
Toby.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.518
I'm sorry.

23:54.600 --> 23:58.195
PIease, just tell me what you know
about my daughter's whereabouts.

23:58.280 --> 23:59.872
I don't know where she is.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.473
Careful, Toby.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.398
I don't.
-Then tell us what you do know.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.953
Someone bought Lisa
a bus ticket home.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.351
But she didn't get there.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.590
I think it's a possibility...

24:20.800 --> 24:24.110
This is just what I think here.
-Go on.

24:26.040 --> 24:31.717
Please.
-Well, I think that she could be...

24:31.800 --> 24:34.473
She might be in some
kind of trouble.

24:40.480 --> 24:43.916
Mrs Greyson, did Lisa ever
mention a kid named Daniel?

24:46.720 --> 24:48.358
I don't think so.

24:50.120 --> 24:53.908
Will this Daniel know where she is?
-I'm not sure.

24:55.400 --> 24:57.550
Can I talk to this Daniel?

24:58.120 --> 25:00.270
Ball's in your court, Logan.

25:04.520 --> 25:06.875
Hey. What's up?
-It's that time.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.429
Nice.

25:35.560 --> 25:38.313
Hey, Daniel. Daniel.

25:39.520 --> 25:43.877
What the hell do you want, skid mark?
-Just want you to meet someone.

25:45.080 --> 25:49.232
I'm Detective Charlie Marks.
I just want to ask you a few questions.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.116
Do you know a Lisa Greyson?

25:56.240 --> 25:57.355
Lisa!

26:03.960 --> 26:05.075
Mom.

26:05.560 --> 26:06.754
Lisa?

26:10.800 --> 26:15.954
Lisa. Thank God you're alive!
When I didn't hear from you, I thought...

26:17.360 --> 26:19.874
What have you done to yourself?

26:25.280 --> 26:31.355
Mom, I'm Daniel now.
-Sweetie, you're making a terrible mistake.

26:32.440 --> 26:33.839
You're too young to make
a decision like this.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.672
I've known since I was six.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.877
You could change your mind.
And there's therapy.

26:39.720 --> 26:44.589
They could discover a drug.
If you do this, there's no going back.

26:44.880 --> 26:46.154
You don't understand.

26:46.240 --> 26:51.314
Look, we'll go home. We'll talk.
We'll get you back on anti-depressants.

26:51.400 --> 26:55.678
I'm not depressed any more, Mom.
-My baby girl, I thought I lost you.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.552
You've lost your daughter, Mom,

26:58.640 --> 27:03.031
and unless you can accept that,
you're gonna lose me, too.

27:04.400 --> 27:08.518
Maybe if we go back to the church.
Lisa, you can't do this!

27:08.600 --> 27:11.876
You still don't understand.
You'll never understand.

27:38.360 --> 27:42.638
He's gone. I don't know where he is.
-What are you going to do?

27:43.520 --> 27:46.159
We found your missing child.
The rest is up to you.

27:46.240 --> 27:49.073
Or I can give you a ride back
to the hotel if you want.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.435
You coming?
-I'll be a minute.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.629
Man, I could not imagine
wanting to get a sex change.

28:30.720 --> 28:32.392
I'm a guy, you know? It's perfect.

28:32.480 --> 28:35.870
I don't have to smell good.
I don't have to pluck anything.

28:35.960 --> 28:39.236
It's amazing to me that you
don't have a girlfriend.

28:39.320 --> 28:40.799
Dude, shut up.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.951
I can relate to what
this kid's going through.

28:46.040 --> 28:47.837
Say what?
-Having to hide who you really are

28:47.920 --> 28:49.831
from your friends,
your family, the whole world.

28:49.920 --> 28:51.069
I completely understand that.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.230
And then I come around,
this kid's got a brand-new Iife,

28:53.320 --> 28:54.389
and I ruin it for him.

28:54.480 --> 28:56.277
Toby, don't worry about it.
We'll find him, okay?

28:56.360 --> 28:59.557
No, Oz, I gotta stop getting
into people's Iives.

28:59.880 --> 29:04.032
You know, I have said that before.
-When?

29:04.600 --> 29:06.716
Doesn't it sound like something I'd say?
-No.

29:15.360 --> 29:18.352
Find Daniel yet?
-No, no, I'm having a hard time.

29:18.440 --> 29:19.668
You think you can help me out here?

29:19.760 --> 29:22.115
It's not a police matter,
it's for social services.

29:22.200 --> 29:26.273
You know, if Ramone gets to him first,
he's going to be all over him.

29:26.360 --> 29:29.238
You're a cop. You've been to where he hangs.

29:29.680 --> 29:33.070
Okay, well, maybe you got a point.

29:33.160 --> 29:36.789
Maybe we did a good thing and maybe
Daniel stayed away from Ramone.

29:36.880 --> 29:38.552
No, he can't. He won't.

29:38.640 --> 29:43.395
He needs to get more steroids first.
You know he's not cut out for the streets.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.470
Girl-to-boy transgenders
need testosterone.

29:47.560 --> 29:50.313
Daniel's been shooting steroids
because that's all he can get.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.597
So, that's why he's hitting the drugstores,
to get what he needs.

29:53.680 --> 29:57.275
AII right, I'll write a report.
We find Daniel, we'll bring him in.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.749
So, it's not enough
to shake down Ramone,

29:59.840 --> 30:02.400
and in the process,
ask him where Daniel is?

30:02.480 --> 30:04.948
Do you think he's going to tell us?

30:07.080 --> 30:10.277
Logan, you hear me?
-Yeah.

30:11.880 --> 30:14.348
I hear you.
-Come on, Logan!

30:14.440 --> 30:16.556
You gotta let me do my job.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.275
He didn't hear me.

30:20.520 --> 30:23.956
So, this Daniel is Lisa?
-Yeah.

30:24.720 --> 30:27.553
She pretended to leave,
then came back as Daniel.

30:27.640 --> 30:33.112
And then I guess he told people that he
killed Lisa to gain some kind of respect.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.792
I wish she would have told me.

30:35.880 --> 30:38.917
Well, maybe she felt she
couldn't tell anybody.

30:39.920 --> 30:43.117
This guy, Baggy.
I think he knows where Daniel is.

30:46.160 --> 30:48.390
Sorry. I wish I could help you.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.592
All right, thanks.

30:52.240 --> 30:56.358
The ride was so scary!
Know when you get butterflies? Crazy!

30:56.440 --> 30:57.793
Hey, Cuz.

30:58.800 --> 31:03.157
I need you to help me find Daniel.
You knew all along, didn't you?

31:04.920 --> 31:06.114
You knew about Daniel and Lisa.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.475
That's why you didn't want
to talk to me about it.

31:08.560 --> 31:12.758
I need to find where Baggy is,
'cause if I don't,

31:12.840 --> 31:16.753
this time it won't just be Lisa who's dead,
it might be Daniel.

31:18.600 --> 31:19.715
Cuz.

31:20.440 --> 31:23.557
Hey, fellows.
What can I do for you?

31:24.080 --> 31:25.911
You guys want some V?

31:27.600 --> 31:29.830
I said 10 bucks a pop, right?

31:32.680 --> 31:35.069
You fellows take care, now.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.878
Where's Daniel?

31:37.600 --> 31:39.556
I know about Ramone
and the drugstores.

31:40.120 --> 31:43.556
We do it tonight.
-I'm with you.

31:45.080 --> 31:46.399
No, man, I don't really know.

31:46.480 --> 31:49.233
You don't know. You don't
really know? Where's Daniel?

31:49.920 --> 31:51.638
Daniel goes down tonight.

32:03.160 --> 32:07.551
Hey, Oz. Come meet me at my place.
They're going to kill Daniel tonight.

32:22.600 --> 32:23.874
Full yet?

32:28.520 --> 32:30.078
How do we even know
this is the place?

32:30.160 --> 32:31.559
It's Ramone's hood.

32:31.640 --> 32:34.200
I've seen the shamrock.
-Okay, you're the telepath.

32:34.280 --> 32:35.679
Well, I don't know how
else to find Daniel.

32:35.760 --> 32:39.548
Hopefully, Ramone will lead us to him and
the pharmacy they're going to break into.

32:39.640 --> 32:41.790
Okay, I get that part,
but then what do we do?

32:41.880 --> 32:45.270
Well, we're going to go in there and get
him out of there before something happens.

32:45.360 --> 32:49.114
Personally, I think we should
just call Detective Marks on this.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.838
Well, I have.
I left her a few messages.

32:50.920 --> 32:54.754
And? And that's why
we're sitting in my car

32:54.840 --> 32:57.229
in front of the place that
Ramone supposedly hangs out.

32:57.320 --> 32:59.675
You're so smart.
-Yeah.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.751
Where you going?
-I'm hungry.

33:01.840 --> 33:03.478
You just ate half a
convenience store.

33:03.560 --> 33:06.916
Well, when I'm bored I eat.
-Do you get bored a lot?

33:08.080 --> 33:10.071
Is that a fat joke?
-Bye.

33:23.040 --> 33:24.598
Hey, Ramone.

33:28.280 --> 33:32.831
Okay, so you're paying off security
guards for alarm codes. Nice, Ramone.

33:39.400 --> 33:40.719
Sorry, Oz.

33:43.720 --> 33:46.792
Yo, Baggy, is this on or what?
-Yeah, it's on.

33:46.880 --> 33:48.313
Then, what the hell?
Where is everyone?

33:48.400 --> 33:52.439
I gave them the night off.
-Ramone?

33:54.200 --> 33:57.636
The security codes. Get to work.

34:11.320 --> 34:13.675
You ready for this, Baggy?
-Yeah.

34:14.159 --> 34:15.956
Yeah? Good.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.752
Who, me?
-Yeah.

34:21.520 --> 34:25.353
I changed my mind. I think it's
time you got your hands dirty.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.431
Show me what type of nuts you got.

34:27.520 --> 34:29.192
All right?
-Yeah.

35:13.560 --> 35:14.709
Hello?

35:16.040 --> 35:17.189
When?

35:18.960 --> 35:20.518
Damn it, Logan!

35:26.600 --> 35:29.034
What took you so long?
-It was dark.

35:29.600 --> 35:32.797
What the hell, Ramone?
-"What the hell?" Watch your mouth.

35:32.880 --> 35:36.236
I'm thinking maybe you got a couple of vials
you're holding off for your best customer?

35:36.320 --> 35:37.514
You wouldn't be doing that,
would you?

35:37.600 --> 35:39.238
No, man. You know I give
you all my business.

35:41.720 --> 35:43.790
What do we have here?
Is that the deal?

35:43.880 --> 35:46.519
So, you gonna rat me out,
get yourself a free ride

35:46.600 --> 35:49.478
and then start up the deal all over again,
huh? Is that what you think?

35:49.560 --> 35:52.074
No, look, I never told the cops anything!
-You're lying.

35:52.160 --> 35:54.116
Listen, okay? I need the 'roids for myself.
-Shut up, Danny!

35:54.200 --> 35:55.269
Do it!

35:55.360 --> 35:56.759
What are you waiting for?
-Shut up!

36:02.120 --> 36:04.270
Where you going? Where you going?

36:05.240 --> 36:06.514
Please don't kill me.

36:14.560 --> 36:16.391
Freeze! Police!

36:17.440 --> 36:19.556
There was nothing going on.

36:23.520 --> 36:26.034
You all right?
-Yeah. My arm always bleeds like this.

36:26.120 --> 36:28.429
Oh, that's good. For a second there I
thought he broke your sarcasm bone.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.078
Sit down, man.

36:33.240 --> 36:35.708
It'll be okay.
-Thanks.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.509
Why is it always so complicated?

36:42.160 --> 36:46.438
You know, just wondering
who I am, what I am.

36:46.520 --> 36:49.876
You know, I used to ask myself
that a lot. Most people do.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.076
They spend their whole lives
trying to figure it out.

36:52.160 --> 36:53.479
You're pretty young, man.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.676
You seem like you got it together.
That's cool.

36:56.920 --> 37:01.994
Yeah, you sound like a cheesy pamphlet.
-Yeah, I do. AII right, it's a little lame.

37:02.640 --> 37:05.279
It doesn't mean it's not true.

37:11.360 --> 37:15.239
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.
-It's okay. I understand.

37:18.280 --> 37:21.670
Lisa?
-I'll Ieave you guys alone.

37:23.480 --> 37:26.392
Hello, Mom.
- We've got an early flight.

37:27.480 --> 37:30.472
And I've set up an
appointment for you and me,

37:30.560 --> 37:33.836
for the two of us, honey,
with Dr Patterson.

37:33.920 --> 37:36.434
I don't need to see Dr Patterson.

37:36.520 --> 37:38.829
We can work this out together.

37:39.600 --> 37:44.628
I'll deal with what you want to be.
-I don't want you to deal with anything.

37:44.720 --> 37:48.395
Sweetheart, I love you.
I'm sorry. I've been wrong.

37:51.280 --> 37:54.875
I just want you to
accept me for who I am.

37:58.760 --> 38:05.108
I can't do that. I will. I'll try. Oh, God.

38:08.800 --> 38:13.669
I'm not going home with you.
-Please, don't say that.

38:16.040 --> 38:18.998
Lisa, you are everything to me.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.718
I love you.

38:23.320 --> 38:24.912
I love you, Mom.

38:27.360 --> 38:29.191
But my name is Daniel.

38:32.720 --> 38:35.029
I want to take you home with me.

38:36.800 --> 38:40.554
I think I have to stay here.
For now.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.075
Oz!
-Hey.

39:20.160 --> 39:21.149
Hey!
-You good?

39:21.240 --> 39:22.912
Yeah, we're good.

39:24.680 --> 39:28.070
Hey, how you doing? Osman Bey.
Oz for short, probably.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.674
You got two of us
on the Iist tonight.

39:30.760 --> 39:33.228
You gentlemen are not on the list, ja?

39:33.320 --> 39:37.791
No, no, no. Hold on. Hold on!
We saved Young Thunda's life, dawg. Sir.

39:37.880 --> 39:40.314
We saved his life.
That's all I'm saying. He's my boy.

39:41.960 --> 39:44.269
I'm not sure if he's holding up.

39:55.200 --> 39:57.156
Yo, Thunda in the house! Boo!

39:57.760 --> 39:58.988
Yo, Thunda, what's up?
You recognise me?

39:59.080 --> 40:01.674
Let's go! Thunda poses good.
Take a picture, baby.

40:01.760 --> 40:04.558
There's a little trouble with the guest
list. Remember, Oz from the hospital?

40:04.640 --> 40:05.709
Pen!

40:07.760 --> 40:10.513
This ain't even my CD.
-No, I know. It's mine.

40:10.600 --> 40:11.999
Hey, man. Good to see you.

40:12.560 --> 40:13.675
Hey, man!
-What's going on, people?

40:13.760 --> 40:16.797
Ooh! Hot girls. Y'all come on with me.
Y'all come over there.

40:19.040 --> 40:22.396
Thunda! I didn't want you
to sign. It's my demo!

40:23.760 --> 40:26.274
Okay, hi. And you
have a good night.

40:28.800 --> 40:32.190
Hey, Oz. I snuck a
demo into his jacket.

40:34.680 --> 40:36.318
And so it begins.
