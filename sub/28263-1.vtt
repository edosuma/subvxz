[Moans]

01:50.694 --> 01:54.607
I liked you back
when we was in elementary...

01:56.074 --> 01:57.735
In Mr. Lorenzo's class.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.942
I liked you, too.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.579
Wish I knew that.

02:06.877 --> 02:09.619
Though I would've needed
an instruction manual back then.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.088
Ever thought about doing something else?

02:15.177 --> 02:16.758
Some other kind of work?

02:18.180 --> 02:20.171
Not real serious or anything.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.260
Worked at the mall for a little while.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.110
Let me look if you don't mind.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.527
I've had a long intermission.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.009
[Music playing over car radio]

03:16.363 --> 03:18.604
I'MMA talk with Andre on Tuesday.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.115
You interested if something comes up?

03:23.328 --> 03:25.319
Before I consider that kind of vocation,

03:26.540 --> 03:28.280
I need to get myself acclimated.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.375
Certainly.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.952
Walk around, breathe some air,
gaze at the sky,

03:34.589 --> 03:36.545
see how blue it looks on the outside.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.465
Enjoy yourself.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.134
Once I've settled, I'll let you know.

03:43.890 --> 03:44.970
Anyhow...

03:46.059 --> 03:47.674
Thanks for setting that up with Lana.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.851
And for fetching me.

you're not gonna hurt him.

- Understand?
- I do.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.333
A'ight.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.883
Take those garbage bags
that are outside down to the trash.

Okay, I will.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.597
Fool, you just cost me.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.553
Ma, how long you been doing this?

06:39.983 --> 06:41.143
Not long.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.940
What happened to your job at the grocery?

06:43.612 --> 06:44.612
I got fired.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.233
I left you money before I went in.

06:47.699 --> 06:48.984
Plenty for twice as long.

It ran out.

06:50.869 --> 06:51.869
Yeah...

06:52.913 --> 06:55.325
And I can see its footprints
up and down your arms.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.952
Look, you ain't got no right
lecturing me about nothing.

06:58.043 --> 07:01.080
Your ass went to jail.
I did what I had to do.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.379
Ma, let's fast-forward all this.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.256
Ain't no point in arguing
about a bunch of yesterdays.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.801
You can't be doing this.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.965
Hooking, needles...

07:17.604 --> 07:20.346
And especially not in front of Ethan
at all, ever.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.980
He ain't a toddler no more.

07:23.902 --> 07:26.735
And you doing those things around him,
it'll mess him up permanent.

So, you gonna take care of us now, huh?

07:33.078 --> 07:35.740

with the cork in it.

There was little time
and less inclination.

the amount of makeup latinas carry?

You stay there.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.496
Why don't you shut the doors
and crank up the fans?

Where did your novio put
that green duffel bag you got last night?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.434
Can I have something to wear?

17:06.483 --> 17:07.564
I'm cold.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.148
I didn't understand that, did you?

17:12.240 --> 17:13.240
No.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.402
Sounded kind of like dolphin.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.319
I expect she'll get more intelligible
when she answers our questions.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.238
- Where's the green duffel bag?
- I wanna call a lawyer.

last night at 11:00,

that swell guy who fled
and left you here with us.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.140
- Least he had time...
- [Ball rolls]

17:42.228 --> 17:43.843
To get his soul mate.

17:51.654 --> 17:52.814
Tell us where it is,

17:52.905 --> 17:56.693
and my partner and I will be done in time
to get the breakfast special at Bert's.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.652
Maybe that's reason enough to forget
all about you and that gun of yours.

18:04.959 --> 18:05.959
Where is it?

18:09.380 --> 18:10.380
The closet.

18:11.924 --> 18:12.924
There.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.388
In the wall behind the suits.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.860
I smell three eggs over easy.

18:49.003 --> 18:50.118
Hash browns...

18:52.089 --> 18:53.124
And pumpernickel toast.

to drive downtown and paper.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.950
You said if I told you where the bag was,
you'll let me go.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.034

The day men started saying,
"we're pregnant,”

20:08.958 --> 20:10.289

20:19.927 --> 20:21.463

was so fond of intrigue.

Excuse me.

20:42.658 --> 20:44.899
Could you box our food up
in to-go containers?

20:45.661 --> 20:48.323
You want me to pack up
everything I just carried

20:48.414 --> 20:50.621
- from all the way over there?
- Correct.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.916
I'll get some take-out boxes.

21:05.765 --> 21:09.132
You two crash into a truck
filled with breakfast buffet?

21:09.226 --> 21:12.263
We were getting the breakfast specials
at Bert's when we got your message

21:12.354 --> 21:15.517
and we boxed them up
and rode in with their emanations.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.769
I like their pumpernickel toast.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.726
They get it fresh from Jeanette's,
bakery across the way.

21:22.156 --> 21:23.316
[Clears throat]

21:27.203 --> 21:29.444
There's an issue with the bust
you two made this morning.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.618
Who's complaining?

21:31.457 --> 21:33.664
Civilian, saw you out on the fire escape.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.079
Vasquez was armed and a threat.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.785
- We did what was...
- There's a video.

21:38.589 --> 21:39.749
[Sighs]

21:40.466 --> 21:41.546
You've seen it?

21:41.634 --> 21:43.374
I have. It's not terrible.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.301
Certainly could be much, much better.

21:47.389 --> 21:48.549
Sound is shit.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.348
Civilian was too far away
to get anything intelligible.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.592
- That helps us.
- Who tipped you off?

21:54.271 --> 21:55.761
My contact at channel 7.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.181

22:02.947 --> 22:05.108

- 6:00.

22:06.951 --> 22:07.986
You'll survive.

22:09.495 --> 22:13.238
Though,
I think it'll end our current discussions

22:13.332 --> 22:15.698
about raises and promotions.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.910
[Sighs] Anchovies.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.913
We didn't give vasquez
that much cast-iron.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.881
- It was mostly me, Anthony...
- He gave him plenty.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.926
Mr. lurasetti's in that video, too,

22:28.806 --> 22:31.013
smiling like a yearbook picture

22:31.475 --> 22:33.807
when you put your foot
on that hombre's cabeza.

22:34.436 --> 22:35.721
Our inspector...

22:37.523 --> 22:41.641
Our Mexican-American inspector,
is unlikely to be lenient.

22:43.362 --> 22:47.401
Though your productivity is exemplary and
it'll keep you from losing your badges.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.490
Politics, like always.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.823
Like cell phones and just as annoying,

22:54.957 --> 22:56.413
politics are everywhere.

23:00.296 --> 23:03.163
Being branded a racist
in today's public forum

23:03.257 --> 23:06.670
is like being accused
of communism in the '50s...

23:07.469 --> 23:12.714
Whether it's a possibly offensive remark
made in a private phone call

23:12.808 --> 23:17.518
or the indelicate treatment of a minority
who sells drugs to children.

23:17.813 --> 23:22.273
The entertainment industry, formerly known
as the news, needs villains.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.600
There's certainly nothing hypocritical
about the media

23:24.695 --> 23:29.109
handling every perceived intolerance
with complete and utter intolerance.

23:30.284 --> 23:32.240
[Sighs] It's bullshit.

23:34.288 --> 23:35.448
But it's reality.

23:36.290 --> 23:37.370
But I'm not racist.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.790
Every Martin Luther King day,
I order a cup of dark roast.

23:44.048 --> 23:45.834
How long is this suspension gonna be?

23:48.177 --> 23:49.177
Six weeks.

23:50.346 --> 23:51.346
No pay.

23:55.809 --> 23:56.924
We need the hours.

23:57.019 --> 23:59.806

24:30.719 --> 24:32.084
Gotta be aware of this stuff.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.878
Digital eyes are everywhere.

24:35.641 --> 24:37.632
I do what I think best when I'm out there.

24:38.102 --> 24:41.014
I was that way when we were partners,
and I'm still that way now.

24:41.230 --> 24:44.814
There's a reason I'm sitting
behind this desk running things

24:46.026 --> 24:48.017
and you're out there
crouching on fire escapes

24:48.112 --> 24:49.852
in the cold for hours

24:50.406 --> 24:52.738
with a partner
that's 20 years younger than you.

24:52.825 --> 24:55.692
Hey, Anthony's got a mouth
with its own engine, but he's solid.

24:56.078 --> 24:57.113
That wasn't my point.

25:06.255 --> 25:07.335
[Heavy sigh]

25:08.549 --> 25:10.429
Thanks for letting us know
about this situation,

25:10.467 --> 25:12.924
and any word you can have
with the inspector on our behalf

25:13.012 --> 25:14.218
would be greatly appreciated.

25:15.639 --> 25:16.845
One thing before you go.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.892
I watched that video a couple times.

25:23.689 --> 25:26.146
You threw a lot more cast-iron
than you needed to.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.685
And when we worked together...

25:32.531 --> 25:34.021
You weren't that rough.

25:34.575 --> 25:35.575
And?

25:37.536 --> 25:38.867
It's not healthy for you

25:39.371 --> 25:41.407
to scuff concrete as long as you have.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.333
You get results,

25:44.793 --> 25:47.079
but you're losing perspective
and compassion.

25:48.130 --> 25:49.970
Couple more years out there
and you're gonna be

25:50.049 --> 25:52.836
a human steamroller covered with spikes...

25:54.094 --> 25:55.459
And fueled by bile.

One moment, please.

28:47.517 --> 28:50.099

No, no, it's beautiful.

about saying yes when I'm on my knee,

in the right direction.

- Thanks.

those kinds of professionals.

how to do that?

How?

There's a way.

that we're gonna talk about...

- Tell him ridgeman is here.

- He is.

That's only when we're on the clock.

- Glad you liked it.

Even though you've been suspended,
and you're technically a civilian?

Criminals don't stop doing what they do
just 'cause two cops get benched.

just for the paycheck.

who's smarter than you are.

Well, the timing wasn't great, but...

01:05:24.129 --> 01:05:26.461
I was gonna propose anyway.
I wasn't gonna let some...

Work bullshit interfere
with my private life, but turned out...

01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:32.333
She was in a bad mood that night

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:36.722
because of some drama at her job,
and I didn't do it.

01:05:36.808 --> 01:05:39.595
And then yesterday you bring me here,
suggest this thing,

01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:41.517

when I see Denise,
even before she suspected anything...

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:59.160
I know that I can't propose to her
until this thing is done.

01:05:59.247 --> 01:06:01.863
I evade her questions at dinner
and for the first time

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:03.243
since I went to the jeweler...

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:07.036
I'm not certain she'd say yes
if I proposed.

even if you think you aren't.

Well, the nearest most likely
time for a meet up is 5:30,

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:55.599
That's the only way those disguises
make any sense.

01:18:58.108 --> 01:18:59.223
What kind of job?

01:19:00.277 --> 01:19:01.277
Robbery?

01:19:01.362 --> 01:19:02.442
Kidnapping?

01:19:03.489 --> 01:19:05.980
- Murder?
- One or some of those. Yeah.

01:19:34.019 --> 01:19:35.019
Ma'am?

01:19:36.355 --> 01:19:39.097
- You need some assistance?
- [Sighs]

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:40.441
Sorry.

01:19:54.164 --> 01:19:55.449
Can you hold that?

01:19:58.335 --> 01:19:59.700
Please hold it. Ma'am?

01:20:13.767 --> 01:20:14.767
Jeffrey?

01:20:20.274 --> 01:20:21.514
Jeffrey, let me in.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.487
- Open this.
- [Man] Kelly, please stop yelling.

01:20:28.574 --> 01:20:31.134
- I was in the bathroom.
- Why did you put the chain on the door?

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.242
Why aren't you on your way to work?

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:35.265
You are not allowed to answer
a question with a question.

01:20:35.289 --> 01:20:36.745
Don't shout at me, okay?

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:41.121
You just need to go back downstairs,
get on the bus and go to work.

01:20:41.795 --> 01:20:44.252
- Open this right now.
- I can't.

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:45.942
What do you mean you can't?
Of course you can.

01:20:45.966 --> 01:20:48.958
I want to, I really, really do,
but I can't.

01:20:49.053 --> 01:20:51.590
Your maternity leave ended four weeks ago.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.216
You've used all of your vacation

01:20:53.307 --> 01:20:55.764
and every single sick day
staying here with Jackson.

01:20:56.894 --> 01:20:58.134
He needed me.

01:20:59.563 --> 01:21:01.269
I'm taking good care of him...

01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:06.233
And I will continue to do so
until you're home from work.

01:21:06.779 --> 01:21:07.779
[Scoffs]

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:10.858
I hate you.

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:13.198
- [Sighs]
- And I love you twice as much.

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:16.409
You need to go to work... today.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:19.787
[Sobs]

01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:22.662
My job is so stupid.

01:21:27.132 --> 01:21:32.502
I go there and I sell chunks of my life
for a paycheck, so that...

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:35.261
Rich people I've never even met

01:21:35.349 --> 01:21:37.590
can put money
in places I've never even seen.

01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:43.061
How am I supposed to sit at a stupid desk

01:21:43.148 --> 01:21:46.106
and talk about bank accounts
when my baby is here?

01:21:51.657 --> 01:21:52.737
[Sobs]

01:22:05.879 --> 01:22:09.918
Jackson needs diapers...
And clothes and gourmet baby food.

01:22:10.801 --> 01:22:13.417
Eventually,
he's gonna need school supplies.

01:22:14.054 --> 01:22:15.532
And if he's anything
like me and my brothers,

01:22:15.556 --> 01:22:16.887
he'll need braces, too.

01:22:17.141 --> 01:22:20.599
Now, all these things cost money,
and you make way more than I do.

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:23.438
I know.

01:22:24.356 --> 01:22:26.267
Please get on the bus and go to work.

01:22:27.151 --> 01:22:28.266
Okay.

01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:31.731
I'm sorry I said I hate you.

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:33.274
That's all right.

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.190
I know what you really meant.

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:39.068
Can I see him, though?

01:22:40.372 --> 01:22:41.737
Just through the opening.

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:46.041
I promise I'll go if you let me
see him just for a second.

01:22:51.049 --> 01:22:52.209
[Sighs]

01:23:12.154 --> 01:23:13.815
- I need to touch him.
- Kelly, please...

01:23:13.906 --> 01:23:16.443
I... just for a second. I swear I'll go.

01:23:16.533 --> 01:23:18.819
You've broken that swear before
and recently.

01:23:19.912 --> 01:23:21.618
Do you swear on the life of our baby

01:23:22.206 --> 01:23:24.162
that you will leave
after you've touched him?

01:23:27.586 --> 01:23:28.586
No, no, no.

01:23:29.129 --> 01:23:32.212
Say it out loud for it to count,
that's how swears work.

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:36.796
I swear on the life of our child
that I will go to work

01:23:37.137 --> 01:23:38.343
after I've touched him.

01:23:52.152 --> 01:23:53.312
You swore on his life.

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:10.291
I'll see you both
when I get home from work.

01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:30.934
So cute.

01:24:38.657 --> 01:24:40.943
[Breathing heavily]

01:25:05.517 --> 01:25:06.517
Hey.

01:25:07.352 --> 01:25:08.717
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:25:09.354 --> 01:25:11.140
- Welcome back, bonita.
- Thank you.

01:25:11.565 --> 01:25:13.601
Good heavens and praise be to him.

01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:21.360
Can that radiant vision of maternity
that just walked through our front doors

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:24.733
possibly be our beloved Mrs. summer?

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:27.535
Welcome back.

01:25:27.623 --> 01:25:29.113
Welcome back and congratulations

01:25:29.207 --> 01:25:33.496
on bringing such a lovely boy child
into this world.

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:35.331
Thank you, Mr. edmington.

01:25:35.714 --> 01:25:38.626
All of us in the bank have
great expectations for your boy.

01:25:39.343 --> 01:25:41.584
Wondrous expectations on a global scale.

01:25:42.179 --> 01:25:43.179
So do I.

01:25:43.930 --> 01:25:46.342
Well, in that case,
our expectations are aligned.

01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:48.802
- Yeah.
- Welcome back.

01:25:48.894 --> 01:25:50.225
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

01:25:50.312 --> 01:25:54.430
Mrs. summer,
your absence was a weight upon us,

01:25:55.067 --> 01:25:57.934
your return is a divine blessing.

01:26:00.447 --> 01:26:01.903
It was just three months.

01:26:02.199 --> 01:26:04.906
Nevertheless, a doleful era.

01:26:06.119 --> 01:26:08.701
You really shouldn't look that good
after having a baby.

01:26:09.456 --> 01:26:10.366
Thanks.

01:26:10.457 --> 01:26:12.243
It's kind of annoying how good you look.

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:15.076
- Thank you.
- I made cupcakes.

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:17.786
- Oh, double chocolate.
- Of course.

01:26:24.763 --> 01:26:27.175
Oh, yeah,
your husband helped me with that part.

01:26:27.265 --> 01:26:31.053
A small token, a minuscule
manifestation of our affections.

01:26:31.144 --> 01:26:35.763
Mr. edmington, everybody, really,
thank you for this, really.

01:26:39.903 --> 01:26:42.223
- It was really hard to leave the baby...
- [Truck braking]

01:26:42.447 --> 01:26:44.358
Any deliveries scheduled for today?

01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:47.946
Not that I'm aware of.

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:51.198
Everyone, listen.

01:26:51.289 --> 01:26:53.621
Hands up, and keep them there
or this man dies.

01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:10.638
[Electronic voice] Keep your hands raised.

01:27:11.017 --> 01:27:12.257
Cooperate.

01:27:12.853 --> 01:27:17.017
If you make any sudden moves,
you will be executed.

01:27:17.107 --> 01:27:21.441
If the police show up,
everyone will be executed.

01:27:22.738 --> 01:27:26.777
Do not prioritize money
over having a heartbeat.

01:27:27.284 --> 01:27:29.149
Do you understand?

01:27:29.828 --> 01:27:30.828
Yes.

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:37.286
- Mr. edmington.
- Sir.

01:27:38.295 --> 01:27:41.037
Are there any employees in the back?

01:27:41.757 --> 01:27:44.920
If so, get them right now.

01:27:45.218 --> 01:27:47.834
You have 20 seconds.

01:27:50.724 --> 01:27:53.306
No, there is no one in the back.
Everyone is here in the front.

01:27:55.061 --> 01:27:57.803
Are you certain of this response?

01:27:58.523 --> 01:28:00.639
You appear to be uncertain.

01:28:00.734 --> 01:28:03.441
No, I'm quite certain everyone is here
in the front of the bank.

01:28:04.029 --> 01:28:06.145
We will accept this response.

01:28:06.656 --> 01:28:10.569
If you are mistaken, your testicles
will be removed...

01:28:10.994 --> 01:28:12.325
With this.

01:28:15.332 --> 01:28:17.914
Please,
let's not talk about anything rash.

01:28:18.001 --> 01:28:19.437
Everyone is here, as I said,
in the front...

01:28:19.461 --> 01:28:20.461
You.

01:28:24.257 --> 01:28:26.464
You seem honest and obedient.

01:28:26.843 --> 01:28:31.587
Handcuff every single person here,
except for the manager.

01:28:32.891 --> 01:28:34.006
Use these.

01:28:37.938 --> 01:28:40.179
Fasten their hands behind their backs.

01:28:40.482 --> 01:28:41.482
Tight.

01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:47.028
Do not say anything to anyone at any time
or you will be executed.

01:29:01.044 --> 01:29:02.830
Mr. edmington.

01:29:03.088 --> 01:29:03.998
Sir.

01:29:04.089 --> 01:29:06.580
One of us will follow you to the vaults.

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:08.293
Open them all.

01:29:08.844 --> 01:29:12.052
I will open every vault
that I am capable of opening for you.

01:29:12.138 --> 01:29:14.174
If our associate does not return

01:29:14.266 --> 01:29:16.848
with gold bullion
in three minutes or less,

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:20.389
we will execute this woman.

01:29:21.398 --> 01:29:22.398
[Whimpers]

01:29:24.317 --> 01:29:27.901
[Clock ticking]

01:29:46.131 --> 01:29:47.462
[Low whisper] Send it.

01:29:55.557 --> 01:29:56.592
[Groans]

01:30:08.862 --> 01:30:11.274
Will you make sure my baby gets this?

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:14.947
His name is Jackson.

01:30:21.791 --> 01:30:23.122
Must have gone this way.

01:30:23.376 --> 01:30:24.741
Think they know we're following?

01:30:25.170 --> 01:30:26.170
Thirty percent.

01:30:26.713 --> 01:30:28.749
Though I'm hoping they saw us
at brownvine.

01:30:30.467 --> 01:30:31.707
You're hoping they saw us?

01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:34.155
Yeah, if they know they've been spotted,
maybe they'll abort

01:30:34.179 --> 01:30:35.589
whatever it is they got planned.

01:30:38.016 --> 01:30:39.631
Glad to hear your priorities changed.

01:30:41.895 --> 01:30:43.956
Well, if civilians are at risk,
they're the priority.

01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:46.392
Money or no money,
badge or no badge. You had doubts?

01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:48.689
Microscopic ones, if any, but...

01:30:48.985 --> 01:30:50.566
Good to hear things articulated.

01:30:52.614 --> 01:30:54.730
Trusted bank of north bulwark.

01:30:55.659 --> 01:30:58.366
That isn't ambiguous.
Is that an embrasure?

01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:01.286
- What's an embrasure?
- See that opening?

01:31:01.915 --> 01:31:04.156
The horizontal slit
above the word "security."

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:08.205
A guy's in there.

01:31:12.592 --> 01:31:13.877
So it's a robbery.

01:31:14.344 --> 01:31:15.459
Yup.

01:31:47.085 --> 01:31:48.450
We wait until they drive off?

01:31:49.421 --> 01:31:50.706
Yeah.

01:31:51.297 --> 01:31:54.289
It's a robbery until somebody
turns it into something worse.

01:32:04.519 --> 01:32:05.759
You looking to box them in?

01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:08.223
Pointlessly.

01:32:08.815 --> 01:32:10.646
Financial district on a weekday.

01:32:11.067 --> 01:32:12.432
Shouldn't engage them here.

01:32:14.904 --> 01:32:17.190
You think they'd go back
to the parking garage after this?

01:32:17.782 --> 01:32:18.942
Fifty percent.

01:32:24.831 --> 01:32:28.244
Fifty percent doesn't value anything
in a yes-or-no question.

01:32:32.338 --> 01:32:34.704
Hope this asshole doesn't get too curious.

01:32:38.845 --> 01:32:40.301
[Inaudible]

01:32:41.097 --> 01:32:44.134
"The bank will reopen
in 15 minutes. Come back then."

01:32:44.893 --> 01:32:47.430
Might have said 50, with a "y."

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:49.309
Probably not.

01:32:54.611 --> 01:32:56.317
This guy's like a cigarette commercial.

01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:21.630
They're loading.

01:33:21.971 --> 01:33:23.086
[Van door slams]

01:33:28.895 --> 01:33:30.760
- [Horns honking]
- Christ.

01:33:47.872 --> 01:33:49.863
- [Smacks door]
- Christ.

01:33:54.796 --> 01:33:56.206
We could have stopped this.

01:34:01.719 --> 01:34:04.301
- Are you gonna say anything?
- Focus on that.

01:34:07.517 --> 01:34:09.098
We let those people get killed.

01:34:12.397 --> 01:34:13.637
You're not gonna say anything?

01:34:17.735 --> 01:34:19.942
You don't have anything to say
about our culpability?

01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:22.816
Those Italian emotions are saying plenty.

01:34:22.907 --> 01:34:25.740
- You go to hell, you heartless fuck.
- I never saw that opera.

01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:28.951
Look, by the time we knew
it wasn't a routine drug deal,

01:34:29.038 --> 01:34:31.278
- it was already too late.
- You could have called it in.

01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:34.123
When the Van left the parking garage.

01:34:34.210 --> 01:34:35.871
Put the bulwark pd on alert.

01:34:36.212 --> 01:34:37.212
We didn't.

01:34:37.839 --> 01:34:39.579
The chance of that accomplishing anything

01:34:39.674 --> 01:34:43.542
in the 16-minute interim,
less than 50 percent or even 25.

01:34:44.387 --> 01:34:47.129
You wanna call the bulwark pd,
the state police, the feds,

01:34:47.223 --> 01:34:48.838
let them handle it, go ahead.

01:34:49.434 --> 01:34:51.800
But that Van, and the cutthroats inside,

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:55.728
they'll be vapor
before any enforcement agency can respond.

01:34:58.109 --> 01:34:59.349
We're it.

01:35:22.133 --> 01:35:23.669
You said you weren't gonna kill anyone

01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:26.593
unless it was in self-defense.
You gave us your word.

01:35:29.098 --> 01:35:30.588
Get on the interstate.

01:35:32.644 --> 01:35:34.384
It was excessive what happened back there.

01:35:34.812 --> 01:35:36.222
[Cocks gun]

01:35:36.314 --> 01:35:38.771
Do you wish to expand upon your critique?

01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:41.641
Give us the urban point of view?

01:35:41.736 --> 01:35:43.397
He ain't got nothing more to say.

01:35:43.947 --> 01:35:45.187
Hush that flap, nigga.

01:35:45.823 --> 01:35:48.439
Keep your attention on the road.
We'll get through this.

01:35:52.997 --> 01:35:53.997

01:35:54.874 --> 01:35:55.874
Yeah.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.616
Place your firearms
inside of the glove box.

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:05.206
That wasn't a suggestion.

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:11.883
A'ight.

01:36:27.031 --> 01:36:29.568
Cover that weaponry
with the sport section.

01:36:35.248 --> 01:36:36.408
Close the door.

01:36:39.752 --> 01:36:41.492
Close the door.

01:36:42.797 --> 01:36:43.912
It's closed.

01:36:44.799 --> 01:36:46.289
We didn't hear it click.

01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:48.124
We want to hear it click.

01:36:51.889 --> 01:36:53.049
[Latch clicks]

01:37:00.898 --> 01:37:04.436
Do not open that glove box
unless I have given you my permission.

01:37:06.279 --> 01:37:07.279
A'ight.

01:37:15.538 --> 01:37:16.778
You see something?

01:37:19.625 --> 01:37:20.956
Nah, nothing.

01:37:30.636 --> 01:37:32.547
Crud, the interstate.

01:37:33.765 --> 01:37:34.595
[Sighs]

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:36.092
Any idea where they're gonna land?

01:37:36.184 --> 01:37:39.017
Somewhere rural,
where they're gonna exchange vehicles,

01:37:39.103 --> 01:37:40.103
but where that is...

01:38:29.862 --> 01:38:31.318
Need gas pretty soon.

01:38:31.406 --> 01:38:32.737
Yeah, so do they.

01:38:32.824 --> 01:38:34.655
We'll curb when they pull in somewhere.

01:38:35.701 --> 01:38:37.066
The can's in your trunk?

01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:39.610
Is that a question you just asked me?

01:38:46.963 --> 01:38:48.669
[Whimpers]

01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:52.165
Quiet.

01:38:52.593 --> 01:38:54.629
I need to pee.

01:38:56.097 --> 01:38:57.633

01:38:58.307 --> 01:39:00.047
The other quiet.

01:39:08.234 --> 01:39:11.397
Say another word and you're a pirate.

01:39:18.411 --> 01:39:19.617
Cover that up.

01:40:06.459 --> 01:40:07.459

01:40:07.710 --> 01:40:09.701
Come get rid of this lady piss.

01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:47.325
We'll get through this.

01:40:48.584 --> 01:40:51.576
Just do what you're paid to do
and never mind them back there.

01:41:07.812 --> 01:41:10.098
Remember when your ma brung us
out here for your birthday?

01:41:12.275 --> 01:41:15.563
You, me, at least ten other little'uns.

01:41:20.908 --> 01:41:22.614
Severos was there too,

01:41:23.703 --> 01:41:25.785
even though we didn't
really want him around.

01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:30.623
But there was your sister's friends
and a couple of neighbors, I think.

01:41:37.049 --> 01:41:40.132
You wanted an ice-cream cake
so your ma brung it in a cooler.

01:41:40.803 --> 01:41:42.043
What was it again?

01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:47.465
Tyrannosaurus Rex.

01:41:48.561 --> 01:41:50.051
That's right. That's right.

01:41:51.731 --> 01:41:53.938
I remember now. Nigga was a t-Rex.

01:42:00.531 --> 01:42:03.614
And its fangs was made out of candy corns.

01:42:04.535 --> 01:42:07.993
The ones that was white with red
on the tips that look like blood.

01:42:09.415 --> 01:42:11.076
The meal he just ate...

01:42:11.876 --> 01:42:13.332
Stegosaurus or whoever.

01:42:15.129 --> 01:42:16.960
I was really into dinosaurs back then.

01:42:17.214 --> 01:42:18.249
Yeah, you was.

01:42:18.924 --> 01:42:22.212
And you got all pissed and shit,
'cause your ma gave me the biggest piece.

01:42:23.679 --> 01:42:26.170
Yeah. Yeah.

01:42:26.265 --> 01:42:28.130
The birthday boy gets the biggest piece.

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.221
That's in the moms' handbook.

01:42:31.771 --> 01:42:32.851
Yeah.

01:42:33.606 --> 01:42:36.348
But she probably knew my ma
wasn't taking care of me too good.

01:42:40.571 --> 01:42:41.571
She knew.

01:42:44.241 --> 01:42:45.697
Always had a crush on her.

01:42:49.038 --> 01:42:50.448
She knew that, too.

01:42:58.589 --> 01:42:59.589
Thanks, bro.

01:43:01.717 --> 01:43:03.082

Together.

- Well, there's a...
- No.

Only things behind us are
a green pickup and a gray car

that got on a little while back.

01:43:23.781 --> 01:43:24.861
Be vigilant.

01:43:27.368 --> 01:43:28.448
Always am.

01:43:41.006 --> 01:43:42.746
First estimate is five people dead.

01:43:43.759 --> 01:43:45.124
Two in critical, one missing.

01:43:45.219 --> 01:43:47.756
Crud. That last one's a hostage.

01:43:48.597 --> 01:43:51.384
Looks like a large amount of gold bullion
was delivered two days ago.

01:43:51.475 --> 01:43:52.760
Not a coincidence.

01:43:59.567 --> 01:44:00.807

01:44:02.069 --> 01:44:03.900
Six people got punctuation.

Six human beings died.

01:44:25.217 --> 01:44:26.332
I gotta know.

01:44:27.261 --> 01:44:29.823
In case we don't come back,
I gotta know what she would have said.

01:44:29.847 --> 01:44:31.178
We're coming back.

01:44:32.808 --> 01:44:34.048
One hundred percent?

01:44:37.188 --> 01:44:40.225

01:44:43.652 --> 01:44:46.359
Yeah, plus I'm not Italian.

01:44:52.036 --> 01:44:53.242

Hey, Denise, I...

01:44:59.168 --> 01:45:00.453
I got a favor to ask you.

01:45:00.544 --> 01:45:01.544
Pretty important.

01:45:01.629 --> 01:45:04.211
I'm stuck uptown right now...

01:45:04.465 --> 01:45:06.751
And I need some information
back at my place.

01:45:06.842 --> 01:45:11.552
So if you could swing by and get it,
I would really, really appreciate it.

01:45:12.932 --> 01:45:15.765
It's in the right pocket of my tan blazer,

01:45:16.227 --> 01:45:19.845
the herringbone one that I wore
to your sister's the last time.

01:45:20.856 --> 01:45:26.567
And I know this is inconvenient,
but you would really be helping me out.

01:45:27.822 --> 01:45:29.107
Call me when you get it.

01:45:30.407 --> 01:45:32.739
That's it, I'll talk to you soon.

01:45:33.786 --> 01:45:35.401
Love you, bye.

01:45:36.705 --> 01:45:38.866
Ain't the most romantic way to propose.

01:45:39.458 --> 01:45:40.458
It isn't.

01:45:40.626 --> 01:45:42.787
Denise is smart, she's very clear-minded.

01:45:43.337 --> 01:45:45.106
She's not gonna change her answer
one way or the other

01:45:45.130 --> 01:45:46.336
because of how I asked her.

01:45:46.423 --> 01:45:48.664
- I'd give you about...
- Don't tell me a percentage.

Let's grab takeout
when we're done with this.

for some cellophane noodles.

01:46:47.234 --> 01:46:49.350
- No.
- Please check your mirrors.

Nothing but rust and air.

01:46:56.076 --> 01:46:57.361

Nobody, no one.

01:47:06.253 --> 01:47:07.868

Not "we here."

You understood me, didn't you?

01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:56.626
- Didn't you?
- Please face forward.

01:48:49.273 --> 01:48:50.854
Open the right bay.

01:48:51.108 --> 01:48:53.019
Can I take my gun
out the glove box in case?

You may not.

Shoot him and use the spare key.

The spare is on the ring
that I gave to slim.

Where is the key?

01:52:42.464 --> 01:52:43.544
He swallowed it.

01:52:44.216 --> 01:52:45.877
And slim's still out there.

01:52:54.101 --> 01:52:56.387
Should we drive past them
and come at them from behind?

01:52:56.478 --> 01:52:59.936
No. We need to box them in
right here, right now.

01:53:03.151 --> 01:53:07.144
Conflict couldn't happen in
a better, less populated place than this.

- So Reed's still alive?
- That front door looks armored.

- Seventy-five percent.
- What's the other 25?

I'm not sure. Something weird.

01:53:59.624 --> 01:54:01.080
This is excessive.

01:54:33.158 --> 01:54:34.989
- You got a leak.
- I'm aware.

01:54:38.038 --> 01:54:39.153
Don't get shot.

01:54:39.748 --> 01:54:41.028
They don't have the right angle.

01:54:45.629 --> 01:54:46.994
Unless they get on the ground.

01:54:48.256 --> 01:54:50.588
Since I'm already here,
I'll get off the first shots.

to that other helper?

- [Lurasetti] The skinny black guy?
- [Ridgeman] Him.

01:54:59.559 --> 01:55:00.559
[Lurasetti] No.

01:55:01.561 --> 01:55:03.552
I think he disappeared
during the first barrage.

01:55:04.898 --> 01:55:06.684
[Ridgeman] That's a variable
we didn't need.

into his entrails.

01:55:52.279 --> 01:55:53.359
I will.

01:56:09.838 --> 01:56:11.169
Think they're cops?

01:56:14.926 --> 01:56:18.134
Not unless they're crooked ones,
looking for the gold.

01:56:19.848 --> 01:56:22.009
I suspect these men are slim's associates.

01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:23.340
[Gunshot ricochets]

01:56:24.311 --> 01:56:25.721
Just stay focused on your work.

01:56:26.646 --> 01:56:29.433
This duo isn't properly armed
for an engagement with us.

01:56:34.446 --> 01:56:36.507
It's the pale sac in there,
the one that looks like...

01:56:36.531 --> 01:56:38.317
I know which one it is.

01:56:40.785 --> 01:56:42.275
Careful not to pop his liver.

01:56:42.662 --> 01:56:45.654
That is the worst smell in the world,
black guys, especially.

01:57:31.044 --> 01:57:32.625
Let's dump him and drive.

01:57:40.971 --> 01:57:42.051
Shells.

01:57:53.775 --> 01:57:56.141
[Lurasetti]
Should we call this in, anonymously?

01:57:57.070 --> 01:57:58.435
We're not equipped for it.

01:58:07.497 --> 01:58:08.828
Things are getting weird.

01:58:09.374 --> 01:58:10.374
[Van door slams]

01:58:11.376 --> 01:58:12.991
- [Engine revs]
- Get in.

01:58:29.603 --> 01:58:31.764
- We're crashing?
- A hundred percent.

01:58:31.855 --> 01:58:33.935
- Thanks for letting me know.
- You heard me. Buckle.

01:59:23.907 --> 01:59:25.192
[Groans]

01:59:29.913 --> 01:59:32.074
Is her home address
legible in that picture?

01:59:32.582 --> 01:59:35.915
Completely. And she's younger
than she looks.

01:59:38.088 --> 01:59:39.669
Probably had kids.

01:59:47.722 --> 01:59:50.429
Do you have any loved ones
at this address?

01:59:55.313 --> 01:59:56.393
[Sobbing]

01:59:57.816 --> 02:00:00.353
That photo had some
very unpleasant instructions

02:00:00.443 --> 02:00:02.274
that will go to our associates.

02:00:03.363 --> 02:00:05.820
Unless you do exactly
what we tell you to do.

02:00:16.876 --> 02:00:18.556
[Lurasetti] The drip has become a trickle.

02:00:19.212 --> 02:00:20.748
[Ridgeman] Yeah. I got ears.

02:00:23.174 --> 02:00:24.214
[Lurasetti] I'm concerned.

02:00:38.273 --> 02:00:39.558
Should we make an announcement?

02:00:40.191 --> 02:00:42.102
- Say we're cops?
- No.

02:00:42.986 --> 02:00:46.478
That will increase the likelihood
of a hostage situation by 60 percent.

02:00:48.867 --> 02:00:49.867
Hey!

02:00:50.410 --> 02:00:51.410
Shitheads!

02:00:51.661 --> 02:00:52.776
Listen up!

02:00:53.455 --> 02:00:55.366
This is the only deal you're gonna get.

02:00:56.541 --> 02:00:58.907
We're just here for the gold. That's it.

02:01:00.336 --> 02:01:03.578
Leave the bullion where it is
and come on out.

02:01:03.923 --> 02:01:05.254
We'll let you walk away.

02:01:06.217 --> 02:01:08.799
You stay in the Van,
we'll kill all of you,

02:01:09.345 --> 02:01:15.011
vogelmann, sidekick number one,
sidekick number two, the girl, everybody.

02:01:15.101 --> 02:01:16.101
[Van rattles]

02:01:23.276 --> 02:01:24.436
Get the gas.

02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:26.820
[Lurasetti] Teargas?

02:01:27.864 --> 02:01:29.195
- The gas?
- [Ridgeman] Gasoline.

02:01:44.672 --> 02:01:46.879
Don't hold the meeting for me.
I've been delayed.

02:01:49.093 --> 02:01:52.506
I don't think the budget is realistic
for wheelchair access and metal detectors,

02:01:52.597 --> 02:01:54.007
and we need to provide them both.

02:01:55.308 --> 02:01:56.702
Well, let me just do this thing for Tony,

02:01:56.726 --> 02:01:58.446
and then we can get into it
when I get back.

02:01:59.646 --> 02:02:01.352
Thanks. Bye.

02:02:49.279 --> 02:02:51.736
[Ridgeman] You got 45 seconds to come out.

02:02:57.579 --> 02:02:59.410
[Cell phone beeps]

02:03:05.336 --> 02:03:06.451
[Woman screams]

02:03:09.632 --> 02:03:11.293
You got 15 seconds.

02:03:13.094 --> 02:03:14.459

02:03:19.767 --> 02:03:20.767
[Man groans]

02:03:36.951 --> 02:03:38.816
Looks female but verify.

02:03:41.581 --> 02:03:42.661
She's a she.

02:03:52.425 --> 02:03:53.585
[Lurasetti] Mrs. Reed?

02:04:00.642 --> 02:04:02.928
What happened to vogelmann
and his sidekicks?

02:04:09.609 --> 02:04:11.409
Can you get on the other side
of this vehicle?

02:04:21.955 --> 02:04:23.320
Mrs. Reed, did you hear me?

02:04:25.375 --> 02:04:26.706
I'm coming.

02:04:29.796 --> 02:04:31.627
Keep coming, Mrs. Reed.
You're doing great.

02:04:35.426 --> 02:04:36.541
You're almost here.

02:04:49.857 --> 02:04:50.937
You okay?

02:05:07.417 --> 02:05:08.417
Hey.

02:05:12.422 --> 02:05:13.958
[Groans]

02:05:20.388 --> 02:05:21.252
Stop.

02:05:21.347 --> 02:05:22.907
I don't want to see what's under there.

02:05:23.391 --> 02:05:24.597
Okay.

02:05:26.144 --> 02:05:27.725
[Wheezing]

02:05:31.399 --> 02:05:32.684
That girl was innocent.

02:05:36.279 --> 02:05:37.985
Want me to drive you
to the emergency room?

02:05:38.072 --> 02:05:39.733
No, it hurts too much to move.

02:05:42.076 --> 02:05:43.191
And there's no reason.

02:05:47.874 --> 02:05:50.206
I don't have the right words
for this situation.

02:05:51.794 --> 02:05:54.706
There aren't any.
I really hope that this...

02:05:56.299 --> 02:05:57.299
Mistake...

02:05:58.468 --> 02:05:59.878
Is not what I'm remembered for.

02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:02.630
I'll keep your name out of it.

02:06:04.348 --> 02:06:05.588
- I hope you can.
- I will.

02:06:10.730 --> 02:06:11.890
Want me to get that?

02:06:15.818 --> 02:06:16.853
Well, she called.

02:06:18.738 --> 02:06:19.853
I know.

02:06:20.073 --> 02:06:21.358
Well, I'll type for you.

02:06:47.767 --> 02:06:48.767
I'm sorry.

02:06:49.644 --> 02:06:52.807
It wasn't what I wanted to hear.

02:06:55.566 --> 02:06:57.807
[Chuckles]

02:06:58.569 --> 02:07:00.105
- Want me to break it?
- Uh-huh.

02:07:11.666 --> 02:07:12.746
Damn!

02:07:15.628 --> 02:07:16.628
Damn!

[Henry] Get rid of that gas can, nigga.

02:09:26.008 --> 02:09:28.169
I ain't done all this to see you
burn up no money.

02:09:28.761 --> 02:09:30.467
Gold isn't flammable.

02:09:30.805 --> 02:09:32.011
Yeah, I don't want it melted.

02:09:32.974 --> 02:09:34.180

and take care of vogelmann yourself?

No, nigga. No.

02:09:45.528 --> 02:09:46.528
You the professional.

02:09:47.238 --> 02:09:48.899
Look at all the good work you done here.

02:09:49.824 --> 02:09:51.985

over having a heartbeat.

[Gunshot]

02:10:36.162 --> 02:10:37.762
[Henry] The next bullet ain't a warning.

02:10:43.294 --> 02:10:45.535
That bulletproof vest
you got there's real nice.

02:10:46.005 --> 02:10:47.245
Makes you look svelte.

02:10:48.716 --> 02:10:50.297
Like when a female puts on a girdle.

02:10:53.721 --> 02:10:55.532
It's much more flattering
than that windbreaker

02:10:55.556 --> 02:10:58.047
you wore on the news
when you stomped that Mexican.

02:10:59.435 --> 02:11:00.550
Where did you spot me?

02:11:01.562 --> 02:11:02.893
When you drove by the bank.

02:11:03.898 --> 02:11:06.765
And twice when you was following
on the parkway.

02:11:09.236 --> 02:11:10.271
What do you want?

02:11:10.905 --> 02:11:11.905
Stay right there.

02:11:12.990 --> 02:11:16.699
So I can thank you face-to-face
for wiping out all these cruel-ass thugs.

02:11:18.788 --> 02:11:20.708
That's what most cops do
when they get suspended.

02:11:25.211 --> 02:11:26.326
Why you taking that off?

02:11:27.088 --> 02:11:29.044
I need the strap to stop the bleeding.

02:11:29.715 --> 02:11:31.296
- [Grunts]
- A'ight.

02:11:34.762 --> 02:11:36.082
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

02:11:37.556 --> 02:11:38.796
You tell me some bullshit

02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:40.885
and I send that video I made

02:11:40.976 --> 02:11:42.682
of you killing that white girl
to the news.

02:11:48.401 --> 02:11:50.107
I got a real good angle from up there.

02:11:50.778 --> 02:11:52.418
Even got you when you took off your mask.

02:11:53.739 --> 02:11:56.196
- So ask.
- What do the bulwark pd know...

02:12:12.633 --> 02:12:14.464
- Nigga.
- Likewise.

02:12:19.849 --> 02:12:21.134
Let's talk through this.

02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:23.845
Make some words.

02:12:26.355 --> 02:12:29.017
We should clean up this mess together
and split the gold.

02:12:31.861 --> 02:12:33.271
We can fight each other some more,

02:12:34.655 --> 02:12:38.443
do this until we're crippled or dead,
or we can both be rich.

02:12:39.326 --> 02:12:40.987
I don't see how this is a dilemma.

02:12:42.037 --> 02:12:43.037
Trusting a cop...

02:12:43.998 --> 02:12:46.489
One that's crooked as fuck,
is the dilemma.

02:12:47.710 --> 02:12:49.450
Only thing absolutely certain about you

02:12:49.545 --> 02:12:52.412
is that you don't give a shit
about any oath you swear to.

02:13:01.474 --> 02:13:04.466
My daughter got assaulted
for the fifth time two days ago.

02:13:06.061 --> 02:13:08.552
My wife has multiple sclerosis
and can't even walk

02:13:08.647 --> 02:13:10.183
half the time without a cane.

02:13:12.401 --> 02:13:13.401
I need this.

02:13:19.909 --> 02:13:21.945
- Seventy-thirty.
- Sixty-forty.

02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:25.830
A'ight.

02:13:28.125 --> 02:13:29.535
There's a getaway car in there?

02:13:30.628 --> 02:13:32.209
Detective is astute.

02:13:33.923 --> 02:13:35.709
We need to tow this one to the lake.

02:13:36.675 --> 02:13:37.790
A'ight.

02:13:42.890 --> 02:13:47.759
Let's unload the guns together and slowly
so neither one of us is tempted.

A'ight.

02:13:54.401 --> 02:13:55.857
What we do with our friends?

02:13:57.821 --> 02:13:58.821
Can't leave them here.

02:14:00.199 --> 02:14:02.064
But can't go bringing them
back with us neither

02:14:02.159 --> 02:14:03.899
without exposing ourselves.

02:14:05.162 --> 02:14:06.197
We bury them.

02:14:52.084 --> 02:14:53.804
We didn't know they was
gonna grab no woman.

02:14:55.379 --> 02:14:57.870
Nobody was supposed to get shot
unless they pulled a gun on us.

02:14:58.215 --> 02:14:59.250
That was the deal.

02:14:59.675 --> 02:15:01.586
Did you believe that
or did you just want to?

02:15:05.097 --> 02:15:08.635
[Opens and closes glove compartments]

02:15:08.726 --> 02:15:09.841
Ain't no guns in here.

02:15:14.106 --> 02:15:15.812
A lot of firearms in that Van.

02:15:16.650 --> 02:15:19.312
Our word's good. It'll be 60/40.

02:15:20.613 --> 02:15:22.228
We go in the Van at the same time.

02:15:23.157 --> 02:15:25.364
However you want. It's all cotton candy.

02:15:27.119 --> 02:15:28.734
It's not gonna smell great in there.

02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:39.620
We'll put the gold in here.

02:15:39.715 --> 02:15:41.626
Why? This wreck is dead as an insect.

02:15:41.717 --> 02:15:43.753
Right, but I got to sit in it to steer.

02:15:44.011 --> 02:15:45.280
I don't want you cutting me loose

02:15:45.304 --> 02:15:47.386
and driving off
with everything in your trunk.

02:15:47.473 --> 02:15:50.715
You're so paranoid and suspicious,
you're making me paranoid and suspicious.

02:15:50.809 --> 02:15:52.595
I'm just trying to avoid temptation.

02:15:53.312 --> 02:15:54.768
Detective is a priest.

02:16:14.625 --> 02:16:15.625
We go slow.

02:16:16.210 --> 02:16:17.450
It's all cotton candy.

02:16:29.556 --> 02:16:32.468
Smells like all these dudes
shitted themselves.

02:16:46.656 --> 02:16:48.112
Don't fondle any guns.

02:16:50.411 --> 02:16:51.821
On father's day,

02:16:52.204 --> 02:16:54.445
does your daughter give you
one salute or two?

02:16:54.790 --> 02:16:55.995
She's respectful.

02:16:58.377 --> 02:16:59.662
It's all in these duffels?

02:17:00.421 --> 02:17:01.421
