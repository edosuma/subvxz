WEBVTT

00:14.240 --> 00:16.280
You're not alone in this.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.720
Alyssa with a Y.
She was killed in Croydon
about an hour ago.

00:22.840 --> 00:25.000
On her phone, there's
a picture of a man,
we think her partner,

00:25.040 --> 00:27.240
and a boy aged 10, 11,
called Daniel.

00:27.280 --> 00:28.800
Their surname is Airley.

00:32.680 --> 00:35.240
Husband's on a business trip
in Munich, and they're
tracing the son.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.520
Okay.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.560
What did
the killer say to her?

00:38.600 --> 00:40.920
How did he
force her to step out
in front of a truck?

00:43.320 --> 00:45.400
Are you mad?
What are you doing?

00:45.440 --> 00:47.360
Do you wanna watch
where you're going?

00:49.320 --> 00:52.440
Hiya. Hiya, Rose.
It's Carol.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.280
Excuse me.
Do you wanna
move your car please,

00:54.320 --> 00:55.840
- or get your child out of it?
Yeah, yeah.

00:55.880 --> 00:59.440
Hang on a sec, love.
Where is it? Oh, I'm
all over the shop.

00:59.480 --> 01:02.080
- It's strange being
stood here next to you.
- Put your hazards on, madam.

01:02.120 --> 01:06.040
I know it sounds old fashioned
but I hope someone's
taking care of you, Rose.

01:06.080 --> 01:09.560
You've made so many sacrifices.
That means a lot
to real people.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.080
Ah, here it is.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.240
The Ragdoll Killer, isn't it?

01:14.280 --> 01:16.840
I read about the one
he sent to Andrea Wyld.

01:16.880 --> 01:19.320
- Where'd you get this from?
- Found it on
my doorstep, didn't I?

01:19.360 --> 01:20.280
Along with the little lad.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.960
- It's Alyssa's son, Daniel.
He's fine. He's fine...

01:25.000 --> 01:28.640
Hey, Daniel, are you hurt?
Are you all right?
We're the police.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.960
I know they're using
psychiatrists to silence you.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.960
- That's why you didn't reply
to any of my letters.
- Listen to me, all right?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.840
- I need to... Can you...
- I just want to tell you...

01:34.880 --> 01:36.400
-...give me your car keys?
-...that you can
tell me anything.

01:36.440 --> 01:38.480
Pull this, please. Hey.

01:38.520 --> 01:40.640
- Okay, I'm telling you...
- Lift this up.

01:40.680 --> 01:42.680
- You can trust me. Come on.
- This is ridiculous.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.960
Tell me how it felt to take
the Cremation Killer's skull
between your hands

01:45.000 --> 01:46.360
- and breaking it?
- Unlock the car!

01:46.400 --> 01:49.640
You mean the world to me!

01:54.360 --> 01:57.000
Rose!

01:57.040 --> 01:58.160
Hey.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.640
- Carol...
- Rose!

02:00.640 --> 02:01.720
Rose!

02:05.160 --> 02:07.120
I won't judge you!
I love you!

02:23.680 --> 02:26.560
Sir, Elijah Reed,
Mark Hooper's priest.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.280
Reed's sister thought
he was on a retreat,

02:28.320 --> 02:29.720
then she read about the Ragdoll.

02:29.760 --> 02:32.880
She's just ID'd an old scar
on the Ragdoll's torso.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.440
- So, it's Reed?
- Yes.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.640
The left leg belongs
to Ashley Lochlan,
Hooper's GP.

02:37.680 --> 02:39.600
We're also comparing DNA
on the right leg

02:39.640 --> 02:41.240
with Vincent Lewis,
Hooper's lawyer.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.640
His wife heard Andrea Wyld
on the radio.

02:53.480 --> 02:54.440
Roberto Baggio...

02:55.520 --> 02:56.920
the Divine Ponytail.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.400
When Fiorentina
sold him to Juve,

02:58.440 --> 03:00.200
the city of Florence
rioted for three days.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.200
It's confirmed.
It's Alyssa's son, Daniel.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.680
So, this was all planned?

03:08.720 --> 03:11.720
Nick Hooper didn't
miraculously escape the killer.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.320
The killer deliberately sent him
running back to us.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.200
And he planted
the coke in Nick's flat

03:16.240 --> 03:18.960
knowing that we'd use it
to detain the poor bastard.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.480
He wanted
to kill Nick on our watch.

03:20.520 --> 03:23.000
He blackmailed Alyssa
to do it for him.

03:23.040 --> 03:27.040
Killing herself would've
been part of the deal
to save Daniel's life.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.600
- Does Daniel remember anything?
- Daniel's not talking.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.040
Did he see him? the killer?

03:33.080 --> 03:34.640
The kid's basically catatonic.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.400
Carol, your fan,

03:36.440 --> 03:38.880
found Daniel in
a sports bag on her doorstep.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.760
And why did the killer pick her?

03:40.800 --> 03:43.680
Well, Carol's
the moderator of
a subreddit dedicated to your,

03:43.720 --> 03:46.680
and I quote,
"unapologetic masculinity."

03:48.640 --> 03:50.160
So, he's laughing at me.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.960
Are you all right?

03:57.000 --> 04:00.120
I'm not on a kill list
with two dead men.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.280
- I'm not being
scraped off a recycling truck.
- If something goes wrong,

04:02.320 --> 04:03.760
you can't just
rely on Bilbo Baggins.

04:03.800 --> 04:06.600
I think you're underestimating
the therapeutic value

04:06.640 --> 04:08.840
of Baggio's goal against
Locomotiv Moscow.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.720
- I want you to have protection.
- Ugh.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.520
Come on. They carry
your handbag,

04:14.560 --> 04:15.880
keep an eye on you.

04:17.240 --> 04:18.400
We're overstretched anyway.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.160
You've done this job.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.240
You know what I'm trying to say.

04:25.560 --> 04:26.520
Can you cope?

04:27.920 --> 04:29.080
You're the boss.

04:29.800 --> 04:30.720
You tell me.

04:40.640 --> 04:44.600
<i>♪ Always a fight

04:44.640 --> 04:47.560

04:47.600 --> 04:49.120

05:16.120 --> 05:19.840

05:22.680 --> 05:24.600
The killer sedates
his victims, we think.

05:24.640 --> 05:27.160
We can't yet identify
the sedative in the Ragdoll.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.480
It's rare, it's bespoke.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.360
Surely, he'd use
the same thing on Daniel.

05:31.400 --> 05:35.560
So, no evidence, no witnesses,
two more dead.

05:35.600 --> 05:38.120
Rose, by deliberately
pissing off the WPU,

05:38.160 --> 05:39.600
you played
right into the killer's hands.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.680
We have no way of knowing
Alyssa intended to kill Nick.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.200
She tried
to give you a warning.

05:43.240 --> 05:45.440
She said the killer thinks
the world is a lawless place.

05:45.480 --> 05:48.440
That is so vague.
It didn't sound like she had
direct contact with him.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.720
Delusions go unnoticed
if they're congruent
with reality.

05:51.760 --> 05:54.120
The killer thinks
the justice system is broken.

05:54.160 --> 05:55.840
Him and everyone else.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.080
Right, and right now,
is delusion isn't
being triggered.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.440
It's being validated.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.120
Let's focus on the list.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.000
He's gonna try and kill
the remaining four people
in order

06:04.040 --> 06:08.000
in six days between now
and the anniversary
of Hooper's trial.

06:09.720 --> 06:13.000
Well, next is Eric Turner.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.720
He was the guard who
knocked you out at the trial.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.720
Sadly, the blow
left Turner with back problems.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.280
Said he wished
he let you finish the job.

06:20.320 --> 06:23.000
Rose, you come with me.
We'll interview Daniel Airley.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.600
No, I need you
to secure Turner.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.360
I'll chase the DOJ
for a safehouse.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.520
Daniel's just lost his mother.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.600
You don't think he'd feel
more comfortable talking
to a woman that looks like her?

06:31.640 --> 06:33.160
We don't need
to make this
about that, do we?

06:35.080 --> 06:36.960
Turner's our priority.

06:38.120 --> 06:40.120
Rose and Edmunds,

06:40.160 --> 06:42.320
speak to Danny the minute
he's out of observation.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.240
Work out how and where
he was abducted.

06:44.280 --> 06:45.440
Back here at 1:00.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.920
The coverage from the camera
on Packwell Avenue

06:54.520 --> 06:55.560
ends here.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.800
The coverage from the camera
on Balfield Road

06:59.840 --> 07:01.720
only starts up here.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.840
Did Daniel's parents let him
walk to soccer practice
by himself?

07:09.880 --> 07:11.720
Only from
this corner to the gates.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.760
Daniel wanted to look grown up.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.440
- How would the killer know that?
- The internet.

07:16.480 --> 07:18.160
Daniel was getting
the shit kicked out
of him online.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.480
- Why?
- I don't think kids
need a reason these days.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.520
Pre-social media
was still pretty shitty.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.680
I spent between
the ages of 13 and 16

07:24.720 --> 07:27.520
literally hiding
in a Wawa parking lot.

07:27.560 --> 07:31.120
- Where?
Yeah, Wawa's
are like 7-Elevens.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.520
I would sit there
drinking $1 coffee,

07:33.560 --> 07:35.880
listening to Evanescence,
terrified of my peers.

07:38.360 --> 07:40.000
So...

07:40.040 --> 07:41.600
we've got
a 50-yard black spot...

07:44.320 --> 07:46.440
opposite a road
with no cameras...

07:46.480 --> 07:47.680
leading to a T-junction

07:47.720 --> 07:50.000
where the CCTV was
knocked out 36 hours ago.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.800
Wow, this guy's so good.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.880
He can get to anyone,
anytime he likes.

07:55.920 --> 07:58.120
I should've been alive to it,
the minute he flipped a cop.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.760
- First time he used blackmail,
it felt like a necessity.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.800
Now, we know it's
his weapon of choice.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.080
You can't blame yourself.

08:06.040 --> 08:07.200
Can you?

08:08.040 --> 08:09.560
I wasn't looking.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.480
You're a cancer.

08:11.520 --> 08:14.000
- Oh, cheers.
- Star sign,
you feel everything.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.520
- Ah, Daniel's
out of observation.

08:19.560 --> 08:24.560
<i>♪ You believe in your feelings

08:24.600 --> 08:28.200

08:34.520 --> 08:37.680
That was properly brilliant,
my love!

08:37.720 --> 08:39.880
- Yes, thank you.
- Right, go on,
or you're gonna be late.

08:40.440 --> 08:41.520
Off you go.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.120
Oh, can you pass me those pills?

08:46.720 --> 08:50.280
You can tell Rose
he cream crackered my golf.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.560
I used to play every weekend.

08:52.600 --> 08:56.360
Like I was saying, sir,
I know Hooper's trial
wasn't a happy time.

08:56.400 --> 08:59.880
I just switched off
Dad's life-support machine.
So, yeah, you know.

08:59.920 --> 09:02.360
And you got a kicking
in the press for letting
Rose get at Hooper.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.120
I wouldn't be
very trusting either.

09:04.160 --> 09:05.440
Look at it from my perspective.

09:05.480 --> 09:06.880
You come in here
without a warrant.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.840
You haven't committed a crime.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.760
Yeah, but you're still gonna
take away my civil liberties

09:10.800 --> 09:14.200
on the pretext of
a campaign of disinformation.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.800
The Ragdoll Killer is real.
So, if you go to work today,

09:16.840 --> 09:19.880
I'm still gonna have to
run around like a blue-arsed fly
protecting you anyway.

09:19.920 --> 09:24.280
I'm not saying that
you don't personally
perceive it to be true.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.600
The Deputy Commissioner
shouldn't have withheld

09:26.640 --> 09:28.600
information about
the Mayor's death.

09:28.640 --> 09:31.400
- She misjudged it.
- That's what she
wants us to think.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.200
I don't follow you.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.440
You don't get
that high up a ladder
without joining in.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.680
- They make you do it.
- Sorry.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.960
Eric, I feel like
a broken record, but,

09:40.520 --> 09:41.560
doing what?

09:42.440 --> 09:44.440
Kids. Children.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.160
The politicians are at it.
The royals are at it.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.200
Look who's getting bumped off.
The Mayor.

09:49.240 --> 09:52.360
That lawyer who stepped
in front of a bus this morning.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.280
I bet they
knew about the orgies
and wouldn't keep quiet.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.320
- Eh...
- Dad, I can't find my bag.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.080
- Where'd you leave it?
- By the door.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.280
- Oh, the bus is here.
- We'll find it later.
I love you.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.920
Remember, it's my gold bag.

10:09.080 --> 10:12.040
So do you remember
anything about the person
who abducted you

10:12.080 --> 10:14.440
or where they took you?

10:15.960 --> 10:17.880
And there are
no right or wrong answers.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.360
Let's just start really small.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.240
Are you hungry?

10:25.000 --> 10:26.200
Did they feed you?

10:28.280 --> 10:31.080
Or do you remember
a smell

10:32.200 --> 10:33.760
or a sound?

10:36.840 --> 10:39.800
If you don't wanna say anything,
no one's gonna be angry
or upset.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.720
Do you know what to do
when you get pulled out to sea?

10:54.080 --> 10:56.000
It's not a trick question.

10:56.040 --> 10:57.960
You don't fight the tide.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.240
You'll exhaust yourself.

10:59.280 --> 11:00.840
You'll drown.

11:23.560 --> 11:27.080
<i>You make yourself big,
like a goalie.</i>

11:27.120 --> 11:30.320
<i>You occupy...
as much space as possible.</i>

11:32.200 --> 11:33.400
And you trust.

11:34.680 --> 11:36.640
You trust someone to find you.

11:39.680 --> 11:42.840
And if they don't...

11:42.880 --> 11:47.120
Tell yourself that just as
the sun rises in the East
and sets in the West,

11:47.160 --> 11:49.680
remember, the tide will turn.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.000
<i>Rose...</i>

12:14.760 --> 12:18.680
That's Adam, Teresa's fella,
and his mate, Keith.

12:18.720 --> 12:21.160
This was taken
on the day Teresa died.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.520
They were the last two people
who saw her alive.

12:24.520 --> 12:26.000
I knew one of 'em killed her.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.600
But you lot didn't care.
So, I called Faust.

12:28.640 --> 12:29.800
He cares.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.720
Do you know where Adam is now?

12:32.760 --> 12:34.800
No, I don't.

12:34.840 --> 12:38.920
No one does. That means
that Adam killed my sister.

12:38.960 --> 12:42.560
Because Keith's still alive
and doing his stretch
in Markfield.

12:42.600 --> 12:45.520
Faust never misses.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.240
That's what you pay for.

12:48.960 --> 12:49.920
<i>Rose...</i>

13:03.680 --> 13:05.880
I'm off to the morgue.
I need a nice lie down.

13:15.040 --> 13:15.960
Markfield Moor Prison.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.000
Thanks.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.200
Could we talk in private?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.240
I'm just...

13:22.280 --> 13:24.800
I am super respectful
of his privacy, but...

13:26.400 --> 13:28.560
Rose was seen
on the roof yesterday.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.240
He was on a call
and he was behaving erratically.

13:32.280 --> 13:33.960
Define erratic.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.800
This is why
I'm concerned for him.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.800
He seemed suicidal.

13:39.560 --> 13:40.800
Rose? Who told you that?

13:42.760 --> 13:44.480
The window cleaner.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.440
- What was he doing?
- Cleaning windows.

13:46.480 --> 13:50.080
- Rose.
- Oh, he was on the ledge,
looking down.

13:50.120 --> 13:53.400
He spoke to someone,
he cried out. I...

13:53.440 --> 13:55.800
I just thought maybe
he'd reached out
to you about it.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.240
You did
the right thing, honestly.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.280
But does Rose seem okay to you?

13:59.320 --> 14:00.880
I'll take it from here. Cheers.

14:06.160 --> 14:08.320
- I'm gonna take the stairs.
- Okay.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.560
<i>Yeah, this is DI Rose.</i>

14:10.600 --> 14:13.280
I need some information
about one of the, uh,
inmates at Markfield.

14:14.600 --> 14:15.720
Keith Rakman.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.320
Transferred today?

14:18.360 --> 14:21.800
[Prison officer
speaking indistinctly
over phone]

14:21.840 --> 14:23.880
Well, I really need
a word with him
before he leaves.

14:58.760 --> 15:00.960
Come on. He's not gonna
cut through the bars
with a cheeseburger.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.240
Can I get by?

15:14.920 --> 15:16.880
Can you hear me?

15:16.920 --> 15:19.440
Fellas, I'm gonna
need you to stand back.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.560
I'll roll you over
to your side, okay?

15:43.800 --> 15:45.560
You wouldn't believe
the crap they feed us.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.760
I can't put
any weight on in here.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.520
The doctor thought
I had a tapeworm.

15:49.560 --> 15:52.120
I was like, "Oi, oi,
I'm well up for having
a nice young nurse

15:52.160 --> 15:53.840
- popping her fingers
up me chuffer.

15:53.880 --> 15:57.080
And in walks this great, big,
mopey looking sod,
says he's a nurse.

15:57.120 --> 16:00.280
I was like,
"Nah, I'll keep the worm."

16:00.320 --> 16:03.240
You were friends
with Joel Shepton?

16:03.280 --> 16:06.080
Joel? Mm. I heard he...

16:09.000 --> 16:13.320
Uh, I wanna talk about
the death of his sister,
Teresa Shepton.

16:13.360 --> 16:17.560
Her boyfriend, Adam Malick,
he went AWOL before
we could charge him with it.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.960
- Do you know where he went?
- Wish I did.
Wanker owes me money.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.760
What, he mugged you off?

16:21.800 --> 16:24.000
He got this girl to tell me
some bollocks about

16:24.040 --> 16:26.800
how a bloke turned up
at Adam's the night he vanished.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.840
This man, what,
he attacked Adam?

16:28.880 --> 16:31.640
Killed him, she said.

16:31.680 --> 16:35.800
- Oh, did she see it happen?
- No, but it's
the way she told it.

16:35.840 --> 16:39.520
- It was like a ghost story.
- Ah, you think she was lying?

16:39.560 --> 16:42.120
I just thought she overdid it
with the crying.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.680
No one is
that scary in real life.

16:44.720 --> 16:45.960
Remember her name?

16:47.760 --> 16:49.640
- K, something.
- Eh?

16:49.680 --> 16:51.320
Lived in Camberwell.

16:51.360 --> 16:54.120
She had a K on her wrist.
She said I should get one.

16:54.160 --> 16:57.120
She'd always bring wicked food.
French stuff.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.840
Cassoulet bavette
and all that shit.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.000
- Maybe she worked
at a restaurant.
- Yeah?

17:02.440 --> 17:04.480
Not that she had
much of an appetite.

17:04.520 --> 17:09.200
Kate! That was
her name. Kate.

17:09.240 --> 17:12.440
Did she describe the man
she saw at Adam's place
the night he vanished?

17:12.480 --> 17:15.480
I can just remember
getting lairy with her
because she told the filth too.

17:15.520 --> 17:18.240
But you know,
she was a junkie like Teresa.

17:18.280 --> 17:20.680
So, you lot didn't give a shit.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.480
So, I'll be
following Eric at 3:30,

17:30.520 --> 17:33.080
- leaving the prison.
- Houdini, you're
an hour late.

17:33.120 --> 17:36.960
I told Edmunds.
I went to check the details
of Daniel's disappearance.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.320
Next time,
ask me directly.
- All right.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.560
Anyway, the transfer
is scheduled for 3:30.

17:41.600 --> 17:45.080
I'll follow Eric as he travels
from Markfield Moor
to Mount View Prison.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.920
Wait, what's he doing?

17:46.960 --> 17:48.680
He's driving a meat wagon.
Apparently, it's better
for his back.

17:48.720 --> 17:51.720
So, wait. What,
Eric's driving a prison van?

17:51.760 --> 17:55.040
He's transporting
high-risk prisoners
to Mount View Prison.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.760
What's Eric playing at?
He needs to be in protection.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.800
Right. I don't have time
to start the debriefing
all over again

17:58.840 --> 18:01.000
- if you're not gonna listen.
- Okay. But why's he
going to Markfield?

18:01.040 --> 18:02.640
Why do you care about Markfield?

18:02.680 --> 18:06.080
Do you two lovebirds
wanna finish this off
in your own time?

18:06.120 --> 18:08.880
Edmunds, you're with me.
Rose, Finlay, try Daniel again.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.280
No, disrespect, but,
does Edmunds have
the experience for this?

18:11.320 --> 18:13.240
- What the hell?
- It's not up for debate.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.800
Edmunds.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.280
What other prisoners?
Do you know who else
is in the van?

18:27.320 --> 18:29.240
Yeah, I did
a quick background check.

18:29.280 --> 18:31.560
- No one's connected
to Mark Hooper.
- Right. Talk to Daniel.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.600
- Yeah, just take me with you.
- Don't grab me. Rose, stop!

18:34.640 --> 18:37.120
All right. I know I was late.
But don't cut off your nose
to spite your face.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.320
What makes you think you're
in a position to help anyone?
You weren't at the briefing.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.560
- You don't know anything...
- Let me come.

18:40.600 --> 18:41.440
Why?

18:44.000 --> 18:45.160
I don't want you to get hurt.

18:47.400 --> 18:48.680
I don't need your protection.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.280
And don't apologize.
God forbid.

18:56.240 --> 18:58.520
- It's not personal.
- Rose, you need
to talk to someone.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.520
You really need help.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.840
<i>You want me
in a safe place.</i>

19:07.880 --> 19:10.080
I just wanna get on
with my life.

19:10.120 --> 19:13.160
- Well, this van
is bullet and blast proof.

19:13.200 --> 19:17.120
They can drive
an 18-wheeler up our arse
and we'd hardly feel it.

19:17.160 --> 19:19.840
You'll have to tell my wife
that I do know
how to compromise.

19:19.880 --> 19:21.880
Well, I'll ride
up front with you.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.000
No, it'll be myself
and Tony up front.

19:24.040 --> 19:25.400
- No one else.
It's in the contract.
- Eric.

19:26.840 --> 19:29.640
- Think about your family.
- I am.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.960
I'm trying to protect my job.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.160
They're already
gagging to sack us because
we charge English money.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.080
All right, girl?
See you on the other side.

19:38.800 --> 19:42.960
Sir, are you okay?
You can't travel
if you need medical attention.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.320
I just had a medical
and he gave me the all-clear.

19:45.360 --> 19:48.920
And to be honest, I don't care
if someone chopped me head off.
I'm getting out of here.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.280
Yeah, all right,
Florence Nightingale.

19:53.280 --> 19:54.280
Wierdo.

20:29.960 --> 20:33.120
- Did you get to speak to Rose?
- I couldn't find
the right moment.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.280
Yeah, I get it.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.480
I had a kind of,
I wanna say,

20:38.520 --> 20:41.280
blurry relationship
at a workplace.

20:41.320 --> 20:45.480
Well, at my college.
Well, they were my professor.

20:45.520 --> 20:48.120
And no... I'm not at all saying
that you and Rose are...

20:50.360 --> 20:51.600
Are you?

20:51.640 --> 20:53.920
Should I keep digging?
I'm gonna stop.

20:54.600 --> 20:55.480
Yeah.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.920
I've actually got no idea
what your first name is.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.160
Lake.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.960
Yeah, I'm British.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
I'm not gonna be able
to call a grown woman, Lake.

21:23.840 --> 21:27.360
<i>I have no doubt,
Absolutely no doubt that...</i>

21:38.680 --> 21:40.040
Oh!

21:56.320 --> 21:58.200
Where do you see yourself
in five years?

21:58.240 --> 21:59.920
Like, do you want kids?

21:59.960 --> 22:02.280
Are you having them late?
Have you frozen your eggs?

22:02.320 --> 22:04.240
Are you and my mum on WhatsApp?

22:04.280 --> 22:07.920
Sorry, but talking
about ambition in this country
is like a taboo.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.760
It's like, the class system,

22:09.800 --> 22:12.360
either gives you
whatever you want,
or denies you opportunities.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.120
I'm comfortable with ambition.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.960
Yes! Yes!

22:17.000 --> 22:18.960
- This country needs you.
- Is that right?

22:43.120 --> 22:44.200
Yes!

22:47.760 --> 22:49.160
We basically need women
of color

22:49.200 --> 22:51.120
to take control of everything.

22:51.160 --> 22:53.280
You don't think
it's exhausting enough
doing the jobs we've got,

22:53.320 --> 22:56.360
showing up and dealing
with the bullshit, everyday?

22:56.400 --> 22:58.320
I know I have to believe
in myself, I always have.

22:58.360 --> 23:00.360
So, I don't need
your encouragement.

23:00.400 --> 23:04.520
No...
Yeah, I totally see that.

23:20.240 --> 23:22.760
I'm sorry, I misspoke.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.440
What is that word, misspeak?

23:26.480 --> 23:29.160
I thought Hillary Clinton
invented it when she lied
about getting shot at

23:29.200 --> 23:30.640
by Bosnian snipers.

23:30.680 --> 23:33.080
I don't think she was lying.
Fear is subjective.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.280
She made the mistake
of talking about her feelings.

23:35.320 --> 23:37.560
Women in politics still can't...

24:01.720 --> 24:04.400
- Shit, are you okay?
- It's him.

24:06.440 --> 24:08.520
Hit the blues, get on the radio.

24:16.040 --> 24:17.080
We need backup!

24:19.400 --> 24:21.320
Keys, give me your keys.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.800
Eric, can you tell me
what just happened?

24:23.840 --> 24:25.720
Do you remember
if you blacked out?

24:25.760 --> 24:27.840
- Backup's three minutes out
We can't keep him
in the van.

24:27.880 --> 24:29.920
Lock yourself in the car
with him.

24:29.960 --> 24:31.920
Make sure he doesn't go
to sleep. He's concussed.

24:31.960 --> 24:35.200
If you see anything,
hit the horn. Don't be a hero.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.280
Come on.
Come on, Eric.

24:37.320 --> 24:41.160
Stay in your cars.
Keep your seatbelts on.
Hit the hazards,

24:41.200 --> 24:43.400
and lock the doors.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.440
- Come on.

24:49.720 --> 24:51.760
<i>DC Edmunds,
report your position,</i>

24:51.800 --> 24:53.240
<i>what can you see? Over.</i>

24:53.280 --> 24:55.000
Nothing,
I can't see a damn thing!

24:57.600 --> 25:00.400
Open up the cells
and make sure the prisoners
aren't injured.

25:00.440 --> 25:02.360
But careful, one at a time.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.600
Shut up!
Shut up, calm down.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.400
Help!

25:57.360 --> 25:59.160
Hey! Don't fall asleep!

25:59.200 --> 26:01.640
Officer down,
I need backup right now, over.

26:05.280 --> 26:06.680
Hey!

26:16.480 --> 26:19.240
<i>♪ The rise and fall</i>

26:19.280 --> 26:21.760
<i>♪ Of your God</i>

26:21.800 --> 26:25.760
<i>♪ Will tell me the story

26:27.160 --> 26:31.200

26:53.080 --> 26:58.320

27:01.640 --> 27:02.720
Get him up!

27:39.040 --> 27:39.880
Get him out of there.

27:43.320 --> 27:44.880
He's going into cardiac arrest.

27:52.520 --> 27:53.760
Come on.

28:03.680 --> 28:04.760
Come on!

28:08.560 --> 28:09.600
Come on.

28:11.560 --> 28:13.440
Hey, hey...

28:54.440 --> 28:57.880
Gunpowder in the IED.
Old school.

28:57.920 --> 29:01.920
We found a tracking device
by the exhaust
of the prisoner van.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.320
Turns out
there was a break-in

29:03.360 --> 29:05.120
at the security company's
depot last night.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.480
We also found these...

29:07.520 --> 29:10.880
Which is why Eric
was driving unsteadily
just before the blast.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.760
So, the pills might have been
switched?

29:12.800 --> 29:14.480
That's today's date
on the prescription.

29:14.520 --> 29:17.280
The time given, 4:15.

29:17.320 --> 29:20.760
The killer's guessing
Eric's time of death.
He was out by 87 seconds.

29:24.600 --> 29:27.320
And the snake?

29:27.360 --> 29:30.560
We found
listening devices concealed
in Eric Turner's house.

29:30.600 --> 29:32.080
The killer overheard me
at Eric's.

29:32.120 --> 29:34.000
I said I'd be following the van
this afternoon.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.200
The killer crept in
whilst I was in the house,

29:36.240 --> 29:38.240
stole the bag
and planted it in--

29:40.040 --> 29:41.080
Who's this?

29:42.200 --> 29:43.040
Collateral.

29:45.960 --> 29:47.280
What happened here?

29:47.320 --> 29:48.760
I can't remember what he said.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.480
- You spoke to him?
She did.

29:50.520 --> 29:51.960
What did you talk about?

29:52.000 --> 29:53.760
Nothing. His head.

29:53.800 --> 29:56.320
- Yeah, but what did he say?
- That he had the all-clear
to travel.

29:56.360 --> 29:58.120
I guess he stole the pen
from the medical bay.

30:01.840 --> 30:03.960
Oh, I better handle that.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.640
Oh, ma'am, you got some blood
on your shirt.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.200
Cheers, mate,
I got a spare in the boot.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.160
Rose?

30:14.680 --> 30:16.200
I'm sorry, Bax.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.360
You put me in a lose-lose.
I wanted you with me,

30:18.400 --> 30:20.360
but I couldn't ignore
your behavior.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.440
What were you doing
on the roof, Rose, yesterday?

30:25.480 --> 30:28.840
Someone said
you were erratic, suicidal?

30:31.800 --> 30:32.880
Nate?

30:33.680 --> 30:35.080
Just talking to my therapist.

30:37.280 --> 30:39.000
What happened?
What set you off?

30:41.840 --> 30:43.120
You just told me
about the letter

30:43.160 --> 30:46.400
and that you reported me.

30:46.440 --> 30:47.920
You know, you did
the right thing,

30:47.960 --> 30:49.960
but it, it brought up a lot
of stuff.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.560
I wasn't suicidal.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.080
I can't do anything right.

30:56.520 --> 30:58.120
Hey, you did everything right.

30:58.160 --> 31:01.480
I wasn't straight with you,
I disrespected you...

31:02.360 --> 31:04.000
It's unforgivable.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.400
Please, you're great.

31:08.920 --> 31:10.240
Don't make me cry.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.600
Got to talk to these pricks.

31:15.280 --> 31:16.880
Oh!

31:16.920 --> 31:18.480
Finley, get the gazebo!

31:22.680 --> 31:24.880
The killer's riffing
on old kinds
of capital punishment.

31:24.920 --> 31:28.960
The Mayor was burnt alive,
Nick was hanged, essentially.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.960
This is <i>poena cullei,
an old punishment for parricide.</i>

31:32.000 --> 31:33.960
When a child kills a parent.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.240
Eric turned off
his dad's life support
before the Hooper trial.

31:36.280 --> 31:39.200
Well, there you go.
Usually, the murderer
was drowned in a sack

31:39.240 --> 31:42.120
with a snake, a monkey,
a cockerel and a dog.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.040
- Can I borrow your jacket?
- Yeah

31:44.080 --> 31:45.040
So, no dog.
He must have been sentimental.

31:45.080 --> 31:46.680
Somebody check the glove box.

31:46.720 --> 31:48.560
Fucking hell. Don't even joke.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.280
Hmm, burgundy suits you.

31:51.320 --> 31:54.360
This form of execution was used
in the fall of the Roman Empire,

31:54.400 --> 31:57.600
the Dark Ages
and the English Civil War.

31:57.640 --> 32:00.000
In Saxony,
the <i>poena cullei</i> punishment

32:00.040 --> 32:02.120
was used up until the mid-1700s.

32:02.160 --> 32:05.920
So, let's put it this way,
Bach was already dead
by the time they stopped.

32:05.960 --> 32:09.720
You're listening to Classic FM.

33:20.160 --> 33:21.080
Help!

34:41.560 --> 34:44.600
Okay, well,
if you remember anything.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.320
I do know how you feel, mate.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.240
My mom died
when I was about your age.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.080
It's shit.

34:59.960 --> 35:01.360
And I remember she told me,

35:01.400 --> 35:04.320
she was very inappropriate,
its hereditary,

35:04.360 --> 35:06.280
she said she was three days
in labor with me.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.720
And when they finally
handed me to her,

35:11.880 --> 35:13.080
she didn't...

35:16.000 --> 35:17.240
love me.

35:19.720 --> 35:22.440
Or at least,
it didn't feel like love.

35:24.680 --> 35:29.440
She said she felt like
she was being poured
out like water,

35:30.800 --> 35:32.880
from her into me.

35:32.920 --> 35:36.760
And even if she wanted to,
she couldn't stop it.
It was scary.

35:36.800 --> 35:42.040
She felt something
properly infinite.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.120
I believe that.

35:48.200 --> 35:51.000
It never, ever stopped.

35:52.920 --> 35:54.040
Ever?

36:00.240 --> 36:02.160
Never, ever.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.800
Daniel doesn't remember
being taken,

36:06.840 --> 36:09.440
but, he does remember
suddenly waking up
in the boot of a car.

36:09.480 --> 36:11.360
The driver must have slammed
on the brakes,

36:11.400 --> 36:14.520
Daniel reached out
and touched something cold
and wet in the dark.

36:14.560 --> 36:18.000
The driver got out to check
on him and Daniel remembers,
as the trunk opened,

36:18.040 --> 36:20.040
in the light, he saw
what he had just touched.

36:20.080 --> 36:22.320
He says they were human faces.

36:22.360 --> 36:24.160
Could he ID anyone
in the Ragdoll?

36:24.200 --> 36:26.120
Not from the photos,
but, by the way, he spoke
about it,

36:26.160 --> 36:28.200
sounds like the faces
were not intact.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.560
Oh, and he also remembers
a smell.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.840
He said,
"A smell like Saturday."
- Yeah.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.480
His mom would get her nails
fixed every Saturday.
She would bring him along.

36:35.520 --> 36:38.520
- Well, it's progress. Well done.
- It was all Rose.

36:38.560 --> 36:40.360
He told Daniel
about his mother.

36:41.720 --> 36:45.200
- Alyssa?
No, Rose's--
I'm sorry.

36:45.240 --> 36:48.800
I'm sorry. It's your story
to tell, if you want.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.640
I used a bit
of creative license.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.160
What do you mean?

36:55.000 --> 36:58.160
- I told him
what he needed to hear.
- Well, wait... What is going on?

36:59.680 --> 37:05.320
I told Daniel
that I knew my mother,
which isn't true.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.600
And that she loved me.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.600
Which I hope is true.

37:10.400 --> 37:11.840
God, you're odd.

37:11.880 --> 37:14.680
None of the DNA that was found
on Daniel's clothing

37:14.720 --> 37:16.400
match the Ragdoll victims.

37:16.440 --> 37:18.200
But, we did find traces
of acetone.

37:18.240 --> 37:19.840
Oh, that's nail polish remover.

37:19.880 --> 37:22.000
That's what he remembered
from the salon.

37:22.040 --> 37:26.360
It's also widely used
in superglue, paint thinner
and chemical peels.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.880
So the kid's
not talking bollocks.

37:27.920 --> 37:29.960
Type that up,
get it circulating.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.320
Wait. You don't think
that lying to a child
who just lost their mom,

37:34.360 --> 37:36.480
you don't think
that that's problematic?

37:37.640 --> 37:38.880
Sorry, what's going on?

37:38.920 --> 37:40.720
Hold on, hold on.
Whatever you said to Daniel,

37:40.760 --> 37:43.440
could it be construed
as a threat, as intimidation?

37:43.480 --> 37:45.240
No, I was being empathetic.

37:45.280 --> 37:48.960
- No, dude. You told him a lie.
- Did you coach him
on what to say?

37:49.000 --> 37:51.200
How would he know
what to tell him?
- Mark Hooper was able

37:51.240 --> 37:55.120
to kill again...
How would he know
what to tell him?

38:01.400 --> 38:03.480
Shut up!

38:03.520 --> 38:05.520
Get something into your head.
Drill this in there.

38:05.560 --> 38:07.720
Your feelings do not matter.

38:12.240 --> 38:13.560
Finlay...

38:18.720 --> 38:19.920
Ma'am!

38:21.640 --> 38:23.680
He can't just take the win
and ignore the consequences.

38:23.720 --> 38:25.280
I can't stop him, Edmunds.

38:28.720 --> 38:29.560
All right?

38:36.080 --> 38:37.360
Get some sleep.

38:42.600 --> 38:45.000
<i>I am seriously
concerned about Rose.</i>

38:45.040 --> 38:46.400
You don't think
you are blowing this out
of proportion?

38:46.440 --> 38:48.840
No, I don't think so, Ma'am.
Did you speak to him yet?

38:48.880 --> 38:51.880
He was consoling a child.
Compared to half the stuff
other cops do.

38:51.920 --> 38:54.520
That's my problem.
I don't think you'd make excuses
for other cops.

38:57.440 --> 39:00.560
You've had a rough day.
You've handled yourself.

39:00.600 --> 39:03.480
But, I don't owe you an answer.
I've heard you. Let it go.

39:03.520 --> 39:05.960
After the shit he pulled today?

39:06.000 --> 39:08.880
Would you repeatedly question
my judgment on this,
if I were Simmons?

39:08.920 --> 39:10.960
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Don't lie to me.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.800
You didn't chase him
out the room.
What about Finlay?

39:13.840 --> 39:16.120
So, what makes you think
you can undermine me, Lake?

39:39.480 --> 39:41.240
Door, car, gate.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.840
Door, car, gate.

39:44.920 --> 39:46.400
Door, car, gate.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.600
Door, car--

39:49.880 --> 39:51.480
Oh, jacket.

41:14.520 --> 41:16.800
You know, I waited
for you all morning.

41:16.840 --> 41:19.120
I got so mad,
I wrote 2000 words

41:19.160 --> 41:22.760
on the time I caught you peeing
in the kitchen sink.

41:22.800 --> 41:25.680
My editor says it's not
in the public's interest
to know that,

41:25.720 --> 41:27.440
but, I say the devil's
in the details.

41:35.320 --> 41:36.880
You seriously want to do this?

41:50.800 --> 41:52.800
Could you take
a picture for us?

43:11.360 --> 43:12.720
Oh...

44:12.520 --> 44:13.960
Oi, oi. Chin up.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.280
Shut up, Rose.

44:17.240 --> 44:19.520
Can we have a word,
- please, sir?
- You're joking.

44:19.560 --> 44:21.440
You want me
- to trust that man?
- Yes.

44:21.480 --> 44:23.120
Is he house-trained?

44:23.160 --> 44:24.640
Yesterday I saw you go above and
beyond.
I'm in.

44:24.680 --> 44:26.000
You didn't let me finish.

44:26.040 --> 44:28.440
I mean, you can
keep flattering me.

44:28.480 --> 44:30.400
If you stay in this house,
you will die.

44:30.440 --> 44:33.400
We can get you out of here
until we catch the killer.

44:33.440 --> 44:36.160
- But that could take years.
- Would you prefer to be dead?
