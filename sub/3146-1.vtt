00:31.499 --> 00:34.235
(Groaning)

00:35.936 --> 00:38.372
Great.

00:50.318 --> 00:55.189
("Beauty Killer"
by Jeffree Star)

00:58.359 --> 01:02.330
* So self-obsessed with
my mascara and mistakes

01:02.363 --> 01:06.033
* Vanity's like a funeral
and everyone's at my wake

01:06.066 --> 01:10.171
* Before I run out of air
there's more makeup to apply

01:10.204 --> 01:14.074
* Doll eyes stare into
Valium-colored skies

01:14.108 --> 01:17.611
* I've got a sweet tooth
and strawberry youth

01:17.645 --> 01:22.150
* You wanna be my licorice
and misguided youth

01:22.183 --> 01:27.188
* And right now
I'll show you how

01:28.589 --> 01:33.127
* I'm a beauty killer

01:38.999 --> 01:42.636
* Rhinestone my eyes closed
and please fix my hair

01:42.670 --> 01:46.674
* This concealer can't
hide all my pink nightmares

01:46.707 --> 01:50.444
* Before I run out of air
there's more makeup to apply

01:50.478 --> 01:55.416
* Doll eyes stare into
Valium-colored skies

01:55.449 --> 01:59.086
* I almost died
but it felt great

01:59.119 --> 02:02.956
* Faking perfection
wasn't worth the wait

02:02.990 --> 02:07.161
* I may be easy, easy to hate

02:07.195 --> 02:10.898
* But you're so fucking
easy, easy to break

02:10.931 --> 02:14.902
* I've got a sweet tooth
and strawberry youth

02:14.935 --> 02:19.807
* You wanna be my licorice
and misguided truth

02:19.840 --> 02:24.845
* And right now
I'll show you how

02:25.679 --> 02:29.850
* I'm a beauty killer

02:29.883 --> 02:31.585
* Doll eyes stare into
Valium-colored skies

02:31.819 --> 02:35.323
* Doll eyes stare into
Valium-colored skies

02:35.356 --> 02:39.393
* Doll eyes stare into
Valium-colored skies

02:39.427 --> 02:42.230
* Doll eyes stare into
Valium-colored skies

02:42.263 --> 02:46.099
* I'm a beauty killer

02:46.133 --> 02:48.702
* Gorgeous killer

02:49.770 --> 02:53.207
* Hot pink killer

02:53.941 --> 02:57.478
* Fierce killer

02:58.212 --> 03:02.383
* I'm a beauty killer

03:05.386 --> 03:09.056
* I'll fucking kill you

03:43.090 --> 03:44.758
Hello Novella.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.494
Oh, hey Tracy.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.195
What happened to your agent?

03:48.228 --> 03:49.463
What's that?

03:49.497 --> 03:50.498
Oh, I saw that you're
not with Teller & Davis

03:50.531 --> 03:52.466
On the sign-in sheet.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.767
Oh yeah, I've been
thinking about moving on

03:53.801 --> 03:55.636
For a while now.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.771
Really, hmm.

03:57.805 --> 04:00.274
Olivia Thompson said
they let you go.

04:00.308 --> 04:03.611
No, I moved on.

04:06.747 --> 04:07.615
Did you ever get
a call back for that

04:07.648 --> 04:09.249
Budweiser commercial?

04:09.283 --> 04:10.584
Sure didn't.

04:10.618 --> 04:11.619
Oh really?

04:11.652 --> 04:13.053
Well, I got the part.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.588
We're lensing next week.

04:14.622 --> 04:15.456
Oh.

04:15.489 --> 04:16.390
That's great.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.024
Who's the producer on that?

04:18.058 --> 04:20.260
Kurt Hansen.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.331
I thought he was gay.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.732
What does that matter?

04:24.765 --> 04:26.534
Because he's
obviously hiring you

04:26.567 --> 04:27.801
So you could blow him.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.136
Everyone does.

04:29.169 --> 04:30.804
What would a gay
guy get out of that?

04:30.838 --> 04:32.039
Fuck off.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.206
I mean I guess it
doesn't really matter,

04:33.240 --> 04:34.342
Getting your dick
sucked by a girl

04:34.375 --> 04:36.109
Probably feels
the same as a guy.

04:36.143 --> 04:38.145
Besides, it's not like
he's butt-fucking you,

04:38.178 --> 04:40.180
Although I'm sure you
offered that, too.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.950
You can say whatever
you want to, darling.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.786
But the truth is,
you're terrible.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.555
That's why you
don't get the parts.

04:47.588 --> 04:48.489
Oh yeah?

04:48.522 --> 04:50.290
Yeah, what are you, like 40?

04:50.324 --> 04:53.193
I'm barely 30, idiot.

04:53.761 --> 04:56.497
Okay, let's see here.

04:56.530 --> 04:57.665
Oh, Tracy.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.933
Hey baby, come on in.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.201
Um, ma'am?

05:01.234 --> 05:02.736
We were here first.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.905
Sorry sweetie, but the
producer specifically

05:04.938 --> 05:07.341
Requested her for this one.

05:07.375 --> 05:08.976
I'm sure they did.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.678
Yeah, sorry sweetie.

05:10.711 --> 05:13.347
Eat your heart out.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.985
What a bitch.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.521
I know right?

05:28.161 --> 05:30.864
(Car alarm unlock tweets)

05:54.588 --> 05:58.392
(Shrill static)

06:16.444 --> 06:18.211
Shit.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.616
(Knocking)

06:55.649 --> 06:57.551
Eesha.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.188
Novi!

07:01.221 --> 07:02.389
Hi, Eesha.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.125
How are you, I just
saw you coming in.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.027
I'm good, how is Jethro doing?

07:07.060 --> 07:09.863
Oh, he's doing fine,
he just has started

07:09.897 --> 07:14.001
Picking on his privates so I
had to put the cone back on.

07:14.034 --> 07:17.137
It must be strange to
have your privates cut off

07:17.170 --> 07:19.306
Like that, you know?

07:19.339 --> 07:20.941
Poor little guy.

07:20.974 --> 07:26.013
Yeah, so did you have
any auditions or callbacks?

07:26.046 --> 07:28.315
Yeah, I had some
auditions today.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.083
How did they go?

07:30.117 --> 07:32.586
Good, you know, we'll see.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.589
I just wanted to know
how your month was going,

07:35.623 --> 07:39.092
It's almost the end of
the month, you know?

07:39.126 --> 07:41.929
Mmm-hmm, yeah,
time sure flies by.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.065
It sure does, yeah,
it just seems like

07:45.098 --> 07:47.334
Last month just ended.

07:47.367 --> 07:48.569
Sure does.

07:48.602 --> 07:49.837
Mmm-hmm.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.404
Yeah.

07:51.438 --> 07:54.374
Well um, have a good night.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.876
You too, bye Jethro.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.478
Say bye-bye Jethro,
come on, say bye-bye.

07:58.512 --> 07:59.780
Bye-bye.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.615
Oh, bye-bye, he's
saying bye-bye.

08:01.649 --> 08:02.516
Okay.

08:02.550 --> 08:05.485
Oh, bye-bye, oh bye-bye.

08:07.387 --> 08:10.691
(Phone vibrates)

08:14.361 --> 08:15.563
Hello?

08:15.596 --> 08:18.431
Oh hey, what's up?

08:18.465 --> 08:20.467
Yeah.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.735
Sure.

08:21.769 --> 08:24.004
I'll see you there in 20.

08:28.876 --> 08:32.580
Eh, I'll tell you
about it later.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.749
Okay, yeah, sounds good.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.618
Cool.

08:37.650 --> 08:40.621
See you then, bye.

08:43.490 --> 08:46.259
Whatever.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.697
So then the casting
director comes out,

08:49.730 --> 08:51.599
Doesn't even look at
the sign-in sheet,

08:51.632 --> 08:53.400
And lets Tracy audition.

08:53.433 --> 08:54.802
She didn't even
look at the list.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.436
Is she the bitch that got
the commercial over you?

08:56.469 --> 08:57.838
Not just the
commercial, but like,

08:57.871 --> 09:00.373
The last four or five
roles I've tried out for.

09:00.407 --> 09:01.408
I hate her.

09:01.441 --> 09:02.810
Was she that good?

09:02.843 --> 09:05.212
I don't know, I haven't
seen any of her shit.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.080
Well, is she really
hot or something?

09:07.114 --> 09:08.548
No.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.283
I mean she's cute, but not like

09:10.317 --> 09:12.152
Out-of-this-world beautiful.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.320
Right.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.487
And she's got like
this snaggletooth.

09:14.521 --> 09:15.656
Oh, gross.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.057
She's younger, that's
mostly the reason.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.491
Well how young?

09:18.525 --> 09:20.828
I don't know, early 20s.

09:20.861 --> 09:23.631
Whatever it says on my headshot.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.503
Look Novi, I know that
this has been really tough

09:30.537 --> 09:32.072
For you, okay?

09:32.105 --> 09:33.941
But you're a really good
actress, and I think

09:33.974 --> 09:35.943
That you just need
to tough this out.

09:35.976 --> 09:36.910
Candice, I haven't
gotten a part

09:36.944 --> 09:38.445
In the last three years.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.413
Nothing, not even
a corporate video.

09:40.447 --> 09:43.050
Well you're not trying to
do a corporate video, Novi.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.118
I mean you're trying
to become a movie star

09:45.152 --> 09:47.921
So that you can fuck
Michael Fasbecker.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.556
Candice I can't get anything.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.558
So what, are you
gonna quit, just because

09:51.591 --> 09:53.093
You're going through
a rough patch?

09:53.126 --> 09:55.095
A rough patch is three
weeks or three months,

09:55.128 --> 09:57.097
Not three years.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.199
I think that you should
give it a couple more weeks.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.969
I mean, it's always
darkest right before

10:02.002 --> 10:03.503
The sun comes up.

10:03.536 --> 10:04.772
It's before the dawn.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.273
What?

10:06.306 --> 10:08.441
Nothing.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.411
So, you girls wanna
dance or something?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.280
It's Candice and Novella, right?

10:13.313 --> 10:14.481
Why don't you go
grab me another drink?

10:14.514 --> 10:16.283
Another one?

10:16.316 --> 10:18.618
You haven't said two
words to me all night.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.888
Well, I'm sorry
baby, but you know,

10:20.921 --> 10:22.155
We've just been
talking about some

10:22.189 --> 10:24.091
Really serious shit
over here, you know?

10:24.124 --> 10:26.526
Yeah, sounds like it.

10:26.559 --> 10:27.961
You know what?

10:27.995 --> 10:29.629
If you go get me another
drink I'll make it up to you,

10:29.663 --> 10:32.465
I promise, I'm just
starting to get my buzz on.

10:32.499 --> 10:35.703
Yeah, great.

10:38.672 --> 10:42.042
Look, I have a gun
right here in my purse,

10:42.075 --> 10:43.143
And I'm not afraid to
shoot your dick off

10:43.176 --> 10:45.545
Right now on this couch.

10:45.578 --> 10:46.980
But if you go get
me and my girlfriend

10:47.014 --> 10:48.548
Another drink, I'll be
happy to make it up to you

10:48.581 --> 10:52.452
With a handjob in the bathroom.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.655
So now which one of those
scenarios would you prefer?

10:57.024 --> 11:00.393
Hmm?

11:03.130 --> 11:04.998
Baby girl, do you
want another drink?

11:05.032 --> 11:06.633
Yep.

11:06.666 --> 11:10.537
Hey, Louis CK, yeah, you.

11:10.570 --> 11:13.573
You wanna get my girl
a vodka and soda?

11:13.606 --> 11:14.942
Yes, sir.

11:14.975 --> 11:17.410
Thanks.

11:18.545 --> 11:19.512
Are you ready?

11:19.546 --> 11:21.414
Yeah.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.188
Shit, you know
what, I've gotta pee,

11:28.221 --> 11:29.656
I'll be like two seconds, okay?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.358
Can't you wait,
we're on our way out.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.960
Novi, I've already
like, broken the seal,

11:32.993 --> 11:35.128
I mean that dipshit just
bought me like, four beers.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.363
I'll be right back.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.597
Well hurry up,
I don't feel good.

11:37.630 --> 11:38.799
Okay, I'll be right
back, but just watch out

11:38.832 --> 11:41.034
For Ren and Stimpy, okay?

12:01.521 --> 12:03.723
How's it goin'?

12:08.061 --> 12:10.197
What's your name?

12:10.230 --> 12:12.565
Novella.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.167
Are you an actress?

12:14.201 --> 12:15.368
Why do you ask?

12:15.402 --> 12:17.437
You have a movie star name.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.207
Thanks.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.409
What's your last name?

12:22.442 --> 12:23.777
McClure.

12:23.811 --> 12:25.145
Really?

12:25.178 --> 12:28.381
That's an incredible name.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.616
What do you do?

12:29.649 --> 12:31.384
I'm an actress.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.353
Seriously?

12:33.386 --> 12:36.023
I knew it, you're
beautiful and skinny,

12:36.056 --> 12:38.691
You have an amazing name.

12:38.725 --> 12:39.659
Don't worry I'm not
gonna friend you

12:39.692 --> 12:40.994
On Facebook or anything.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.762
Oh, good.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.932
So uh, what's your
name and occupation?

12:44.965 --> 12:46.066
Me?

12:46.099 --> 12:49.803
Um, my name is
Simon, I am a doctor.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.371
Call me Dr. Simon if you want.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.040
That's what I call myself, so.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.141
Are you really a doctor?

12:54.174 --> 12:55.508
I am.

12:55.542 --> 12:58.178
So, do you save
people's lives and stuff?

12:58.211 --> 13:00.580
I do, if you
consider saving lives

13:00.613 --> 13:04.117
Talking to rich people
about how bored they are.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.552
Mmm, not so much.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.087
Yeah, me neither.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.488
I usually just tell
people I'm a surgeon,

13:08.521 --> 13:11.158
But, I don't know, you
bring out the truth in me.

13:11.191 --> 13:14.127
I have that effect on people.

13:14.161 --> 13:17.464
Maybe you should just
change your name to Polly.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.166
What?

13:19.199 --> 13:21.068
Like a polygraph test?

13:22.769 --> 13:24.237
Okay.

13:24.271 --> 13:27.440
Yeah, it's a lie
detector test, yeah.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.111
I was really going 'til
that last one, huh?

13:31.144 --> 13:34.481
Yeah, it kinda came
out of left field.

13:37.484 --> 13:41.321
Uh, speaking of which,
looks like I'm up to bat, so.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.790
You have a boyfriend
or something?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.658
Hey, let's go.

13:45.692 --> 13:47.160
Come on.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.761
Nice to meet you, Dr. Simon.

13:48.795 --> 13:51.131
You too.

13:53.300 --> 13:56.069
Novella McClure.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.911
(Loud bang)

14:31.004 --> 14:33.340
Ugh.

14:34.841 --> 14:37.978
Oh, my god this is so stupid.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.898
Shit.

15:36.503 --> 15:39.406
Oh, fuck, that's right.

16:00.627 --> 16:01.694
Hi there.

16:01.728 --> 16:02.729
What's your name?

16:02.762 --> 16:04.131
Novella McClure.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.066
Miss McClure, I was
hoping you'd make it out.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.667
Oh, really?

16:07.700 --> 16:09.169
Are you a casting agent?

16:09.202 --> 16:10.903
Oh no, I'm just
helping out today.

16:10.937 --> 16:13.040
Oh, well thanks,
I'm happy to be here.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.575
Ha ha, I'm sorry,
what I meant was,

16:15.608 --> 16:20.047
I've seen you before, and
you have a great look.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.049
Do you do any modeling?

16:22.082 --> 16:24.817
Of course I do modeling,
are you looking for models?

16:24.851 --> 16:26.753
A friend of mine
has a company, and is

16:26.786 --> 16:28.755
Looking for some new faces.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.023
He's really talented.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.958
Oh, well what's the
name of the company?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.293
Oh, well I'm
not sure, but he's

16:33.326 --> 16:35.995
A really great photographer
and film maker.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.464
Where's it based out of?

16:37.497 --> 16:39.599
I think he said San Fernando.

16:39.632 --> 16:42.469
Look sweetie, I'm not stupid.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.437
No thanks.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.406
I'm sorry, did I
say something wrong?

16:47.440 --> 16:49.376
I don't do porn.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.610
What?

16:50.643 --> 16:51.778
This is not my first
audition, I've been

16:51.811 --> 16:53.246
Doing this for a while now.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.681
I don't know what
you're talking about.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.083
Any modeling company
that doesn't tell you

16:56.116 --> 16:58.385
The name of the company
is a porn company.

16:58.418 --> 16:59.786
No it's not.

16:59.819 --> 17:01.020
Then what's the name of it?

17:01.054 --> 17:02.389
Well, I don't remember.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.690
Have you seen his work?

17:03.723 --> 17:05.858
Well, no but I've
been dating the guy

17:05.892 --> 17:07.594
For a few weeks,
and I think that...

17:07.627 --> 17:09.195
Ah, see there you go.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.630
He knows that you're
interning here

17:10.663 --> 17:12.699
And asked you to collect
headshots and shit, right?

17:12.732 --> 17:15.167
Yeah, but it's
not a porn company.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.404
Has he asked you to audition?

17:17.436 --> 17:18.338
Yeah, but that'd...

17:18.371 --> 17:19.472
You see, there you go.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.374
Stop it, he doesn't
do porn, okay?

17:23.643 --> 17:26.279
Besides, you're the
one with the porn name.

17:26.313 --> 17:27.513
What the hell does that mean?

17:27.547 --> 17:29.882
Well maybe the reason
people keep trying

17:29.916 --> 17:32.051
To cast you in their
porn movies is because

17:32.085 --> 17:32.852
Of your stupid name.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.087
It's not stupid.

17:34.121 --> 17:35.722
What, was Laura Lust
taken or something?

17:35.755 --> 17:37.490
A porn name is your
pet's name, and the street

17:37.524 --> 17:38.691
You grew up on.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.361
Do you really think I'd
name my cat Novella?

17:41.394 --> 17:43.062
Oh fuck me, are you serious?

17:43.096 --> 17:44.364
Be sure to grab her
headshot, she'd love to

17:44.397 --> 17:46.233
Fuck your boyfriend on camera.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.534
Excuse me?

17:47.567 --> 17:50.803
Fuck off, Tracy.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.773
Uh!

17:53.806 --> 17:55.842
Hi, I'm Tracy Armstrong.

17:55.875 --> 17:59.446
Did you need me to sign in?

18:39.152 --> 18:41.087
Oh shit!

18:41.954 --> 18:43.656
Fuck!

18:52.199 --> 18:55.001
Dammit.

19:01.608 --> 19:05.044
(Novella breathed raggedly)

19:09.616 --> 19:11.184
(Knocking)

19:11.218 --> 19:13.320
God dammit!

19:16.122 --> 19:17.990
Oh, hi Novi, how are you?

19:18.024 --> 19:19.426
Eesha can you come back
another time, this isn't

19:19.459 --> 19:20.827
Really a good time.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.129
Well, I just don't know
how to tell you this.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.598
What is it?

19:26.132 --> 19:27.434
Oh shit.

19:27.467 --> 19:28.868
Novi, I have been
trying to tell you this

19:28.901 --> 19:31.438
For three months to pay your
rent but you haven't paid.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.573
I know Eesha, it's not
your fault, it's mine.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.709
I'm sorry, look, I'll
get you a check, okay?

19:36.743 --> 19:38.878
I'm up for a big role
and I'm pretty sure

19:38.911 --> 19:40.247
I'm gonna get the part.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.081
Novi, you have been
saying that since February,

19:42.114 --> 19:44.050
And so far you haven't
paid your rent, you know

19:44.083 --> 19:45.952
I hate doing this.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.153
I know it, I just...

19:47.186 --> 19:48.821
Oh Novi, no look,
don't start crying.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.690
What happened?!

19:50.723 --> 19:52.359
I was in a car accident.

19:52.392 --> 19:55.362
And I had to get a,
a car, a rental car

19:55.395 --> 19:58.365
Just to, I had to get a
rental car to come home

19:58.398 --> 20:01.768
And then go to my audition,
and now I'm being evicted

20:01.801 --> 20:03.770
And I don't have any
money, and I just

20:03.803 --> 20:05.905
Don't have any place to stay.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.907
Okay wait, don't,
don't cry, listen,

20:07.940 --> 20:10.377
Don't worry, look,
look, just sit here

20:10.410 --> 20:12.612
And we'll take care
of your hand, okay?

20:12.645 --> 20:15.482
I'll go get some cleaner.

20:19.619 --> 20:24.624
(Ominous background noise)

21:19.546 --> 21:23.115
(Heart monitor beeping)

21:53.212 --> 21:55.482
Good morning, how
are you feeling?

21:55.515 --> 21:57.049
You've been out all night.

21:57.083 --> 22:00.152
The medication should make you
feel pretty groggy right now.

22:01.053 --> 22:02.589
How are you feeling?

22:02.622 --> 22:03.823
Groggy.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.458
Okay.

22:05.492 --> 22:07.326
I'll go grab the doctor
and I'll send her right in.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.695
No, that's not necessary.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.563
I'll just grab my stuff
and go home, I'm okay.

22:10.597 --> 22:12.465
Oh, no no, you've
had quite the night.

22:12.499 --> 22:15.034
No please, I'm not
a fan of doctors.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.869
I don't trust them.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.805
No offense, you're not a
doctor, so you're cool.

22:18.838 --> 22:23.410
Okay, just sit back and
relax, and I'll send her in.

22:25.478 --> 22:26.345
Fuck.

22:26.379 --> 22:29.181
This is gonna be expensive.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.284
(Knocking)

22:36.022 --> 22:38.758
Hello, Novella,
how are you feeling?

22:38.791 --> 22:40.092
Groggy.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.494
That's probably
the medication.

22:41.528 --> 22:42.962
That's what I hear.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.397
My name is Dr. Morgan Walker.

22:44.431 --> 22:46.533
I'm the psychiatrist
here at the hospital.

22:46.566 --> 22:47.967
Excuse me?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.369
I came to talk to
you about your wrist.

22:50.403 --> 22:52.539
Psychiatrist?

22:52.572 --> 22:54.541
Your friend Eesha
brought you in.

22:54.574 --> 22:55.875
She told me you might
be going through

22:55.908 --> 22:58.578
A tough financial situation.

22:58.611 --> 23:01.581
So I have Eesha
to thank for this?

23:01.614 --> 23:02.915
She saved your life.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.083
Right.

23:04.116 --> 23:06.152
Look Dr. Walker,
I'm not suicidal.

23:06.185 --> 23:08.921
In fact, it's a
really weird story.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.122
Really?

23:10.156 --> 23:11.357
Yeah, would you like
me to tell you about it?

23:11.390 --> 23:13.125
Please.

23:13.159 --> 23:15.628
Okay well, yesterday
when Eesha left,

23:15.662 --> 23:17.329
Well I got nervous, and
whenever I get nervous,

23:17.363 --> 23:20.066
I get hungry.

23:20.099 --> 23:21.400
Does this happen often?

23:21.434 --> 23:22.902
Yeah.

23:22.935 --> 23:27.807
So, well, and I got
a can of peaches out.

23:27.840 --> 23:28.908
Peaches?

23:28.941 --> 23:30.843
Yes, peaches, to eat.

23:30.877 --> 23:35.882
Because I was hungry,
and, well, I love peaches.

23:36.949 --> 23:40.987
And when I was opening
up the can of p-peaches,

23:41.020 --> 23:44.457
I s-s-sliced and slipped on...

23:46.192 --> 23:48.495
Yeah.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.572
Okay, Novella.

23:59.606 --> 24:02.274
I'm going to put you on
24-hour suicide watch.

24:02.308 --> 24:04.511
Do you have any friends or
family who can stay with you?

24:04.544 --> 24:06.012
I don't know.

24:06.045 --> 24:10.449
Miss, I mean Dr. Walker, I'm not
suicidal, I just told you, I...

24:10.483 --> 24:15.021
Miss McClure, the wound
on your hand is a bite mark.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.556
The first responders
thought it might be

24:16.589 --> 24:18.958
From an animal, but the
blood caked on your face,

24:18.991 --> 24:23.663
And pieces of flesh in your
teeth, proved otherwise.

24:23.696 --> 24:26.933
You must have a friend or
family member stay with you.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.235
If not, you'll be
required to stay here.

24:29.268 --> 24:31.170
And I also want
to give you this.

24:31.203 --> 24:34.006
It's for the psychiatric
facility up the street.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.908
You must meet with
a psychiatrist there

24:35.942 --> 24:39.211
Two times a week until
further evaluation.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.313
Is this clear?

24:42.248 --> 24:43.816
Novella.

24:43.850 --> 24:46.185
We're trying to help you.

24:46.218 --> 24:48.855
You don't need to lie to us.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.189
Now I'm gonna send the
nurse in and get you

24:50.222 --> 24:52.825
All cleaned up and ready to go.

24:59.799 --> 25:02.334
Fuck!

25:09.008 --> 25:11.310
So then I go and check
out, and it's gonna cost me

25:11.343 --> 25:13.512
2200 dollars for
one night's stay.

25:13.546 --> 25:15.882
Why did she say it
looked like an animal bite?

25:15.915 --> 25:17.349
She's a lying bitch.

25:17.383 --> 25:18.618
All doctors are.

25:18.651 --> 25:20.052
I was opening up a can
and slipped and now

25:20.086 --> 25:21.353
I have to go see
a god damn shrink

25:21.387 --> 25:23.255
In an insane asylum.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.824
Don't worry about
it so much baby girl,

25:24.857 --> 25:26.959
I'll stay the night
at your place tonight.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.460
We'll make the most out of it,

25:28.494 --> 25:30.162
I actually think
it'll be kind of fun.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.831
Candice, I don't have a place.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.566
I'm being evicted.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.001
Are you kidding me?

25:35.034 --> 25:36.435
Just tell your landlady that
you tried to kill yourself

25:36.468 --> 25:38.137
Because of her.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.806
You've got her wrapped
around your finger.

25:39.839 --> 25:41.941
My apartment is
attached to her house.

25:41.974 --> 25:44.243
I don't think she's gonna
let me live there for free.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.312
Well she has been for
the past three months,

25:46.345 --> 25:49.048
I think you should
just trust me on this.

25:49.081 --> 25:51.684
I don't know, I feel bad.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.753
I get off work at seven,
I think you just need

25:53.786 --> 25:55.321
To talk to your
landlady and everything

25:55.354 --> 25:57.189
Will work itself out.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.525
Okay?

25:59.926 --> 26:01.127
Hey!

26:01.160 --> 26:03.262
Suicide watch, come
on it'll be fun!

26:03.295 --> 26:05.497
Buck up!

26:24.917 --> 26:27.553
(Stomach growling)

26:44.003 --> 26:46.605
Dammit.

26:49.475 --> 26:53.579
(Phone dialing tones)

26:54.981 --> 26:57.049

calling Sun City Bank.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.869
(Phone vibrating)

27:24.176 --> 27:25.477
Hello?

27:25.511 --> 27:26.813
Is this Novella?

27:26.846 --> 27:28.014
Yes it is.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.348
Hi, my name's Brad Hatcher.

27:29.381 --> 27:30.549
I'm a film maker
here in Los Angeles

27:30.582 --> 27:31.718
And I was calling
because my girlfriend

27:31.751 --> 27:33.452
Gave me your head shot today.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.554
Oh, cool, who's
your girlfriend?

27:35.587 --> 27:37.724
Uh, the one you
yelled at yesterday.

27:37.757 --> 27:41.260
Oh wow, umm, I'm surprised
she gave it to you,

27:41.293 --> 27:43.129
I was pretty nasty to her.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.431
Me too, actually, but we
all have shitty days, right?

27:45.464 --> 27:47.233
Tell me about it.

27:47.266 --> 27:48.735
Well, my producers and
I are putting together

27:48.768 --> 27:50.602
A small scene and we
all think you have

27:50.636 --> 27:51.804
The perfect look for it.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.239
We'd really like to
talk with you in person,

27:53.272 --> 27:55.875
Um, would you be interested
in coming in to audition?

27:55.908 --> 27:58.177
You know, honestly Brad,
I really appreciate it,

27:58.210 --> 27:59.912
But I've been thinking
about taking some time off

27:59.946 --> 28:01.547
For a while now.

28:01.580 --> 28:04.350
I don't know if she mentioned
this, but it's a paying role.

28:04.383 --> 28:06.018
Oh really, how much?

28:06.052 --> 28:09.521
It's 1500 dollars
for a four-hour scene.

28:09.555 --> 28:12.191
Did you just say 1500 dollars?

28:12.224 --> 28:14.260
I did, will that work for you?

28:14.293 --> 28:17.029
Yeah, uh, when and
where is the audition?

28:17.063 --> 28:19.065
It's at our production
studio in the Valley.

28:19.098 --> 28:20.867
I can text you the
address if you want.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.069
Okay, great,
I'll see you there.

28:23.102 --> 28:24.670
Great, thanks Novella.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.572
Oh, uh, real quick, is this
your current email address

28:26.605 --> 28:28.274
On the back of your headshot?

28:28.307 --> 28:29.708
Uh, yes it is.

28:29.742 --> 28:31.077
Okay cool, I'm gonna send
you some more information

28:31.110 --> 28:33.212
About our films and uh,
any reference materials

28:33.245 --> 28:35.882
You may need, otherwise,
we will see you tomorrow.

28:35.915 --> 28:38.985
Okay, thanks Brad.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.800
Hmm.

28:56.668 --> 29:01.673
(Airy piano music)

30:33.132 --> 30:34.433
(Knocking)

30:34.466 --> 30:37.303
Ow, fuck.

30:44.743 --> 30:47.346
Oh, um, hi Novi.

30:47.379 --> 30:48.380
How are you?

30:48.414 --> 30:49.848
Hey, Eesha, I'm fine.

30:49.882 --> 30:51.350
Sweetie, what happened?

30:51.383 --> 30:53.152
Oh, they let me go from
the hospital this morning,

30:53.185 --> 30:55.221
And I'm just waiting
for my friend Candice.

30:55.254 --> 30:56.155
She should be here soon.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.589
(Jethro barks)

30:57.623 --> 30:59.892
No no no, I mean, why did
you do this to yourself?

30:59.926 --> 31:01.693
(Jethro whining)

31:01.727 --> 31:06.165
I don't know, I, I
just have a lot of things

31:06.198 --> 31:07.699
Going on right now.

31:07.733 --> 31:10.202
You know Novi, don't
worry about your rent.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.738
Oh no, Eesha, I'll
pay you the rent.

31:12.771 --> 31:14.540
You are very special
to me and I don't know

31:14.573 --> 31:17.743
What I will do if
anything happened to you.

31:17.776 --> 31:18.677
Thanks, Eesha.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.179
You are very talented.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.748
And one day you will
be a big movie star.

31:22.781 --> 31:25.317
You don't need this
stress in your life.

31:25.351 --> 31:26.585
(Jethro barks)

31:26.618 --> 31:29.655
What's going on, what
are you wanting there?

31:30.089 --> 31:31.223
Awww!

31:31.257 --> 31:34.326
Oh my god, you are so cute!

31:34.360 --> 31:35.727
Little baby!

31:35.761 --> 31:37.296
Uh, Eesha, this is
my friend Candice.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.131
Candice this is my
landlady, Eesha.

31:39.165 --> 31:39.865
Hi.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.300
Oh, hi.

31:41.333 --> 31:44.203
He likes you, oh
otherwise he turns into

31:44.236 --> 31:46.805
A little ball of barb wire.

31:46.838 --> 31:48.975
Oh he's precious.

31:49.008 --> 31:52.311
Well, you can keep
him if you want to.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.981
Ever since he got his
testicles chopped off,

31:55.014 --> 31:57.916
He's been quite a handful.

31:57.950 --> 32:02.754
Oh, yeah, I don't know,
I think he's pretty sweet.

32:02.788 --> 32:04.991
Oh well I'll leave
you two by yourselves.

32:05.024 --> 32:06.358
Take care, Novi.

32:06.392 --> 32:07.159
Thanks Eesha.

32:07.193 --> 32:08.327
Mmm-hmm.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.228
It was really
nice to meet you.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.030
Oh, nice to meet you too.

32:11.063 --> 32:14.066
And you too, handsome
little man, you say bye-bye?

32:14.100 --> 32:15.501
Say bye.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.636
Oh my god, so precious,
have a good day.

32:17.669 --> 32:18.670
You too.

32:18.704 --> 32:19.705
Bye.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.540
Adorable, oh my god.

32:21.573 --> 32:24.143
So cute.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.749
So what do you
want to do tonight?

32:30.782 --> 32:32.784
Ugh, I need a drink.

32:32.818 --> 32:35.287
Sounds good to me.

32:35.321 --> 32:36.655
Wait a second.

32:36.688 --> 32:37.789
Should we be going
out after you just

32:37.823 --> 32:39.158
Tried to kill
yourself or whatever?

32:39.191 --> 32:40.292
Are you kidding me,
that's exactly why

32:40.326 --> 32:41.727
We should go out.

32:41.760 --> 32:45.097
That's my girl.

32:45.131 --> 32:46.732
I'm gonna go get ready.

32:46.765 --> 32:49.068
Wait, do you have a
dress that I can borrow?

32:50.269 --> 32:55.107
(Club music)

33:22.134 --> 33:23.402
So are we gonna
dance at all tonight?

33:23.435 --> 33:25.537
Baby, I was just dancing.

33:25.571 --> 33:27.239
Yeah, but not with me.

33:27.273 --> 33:29.575
What, you don't like to watch?

33:29.608 --> 33:32.678
I bet you like to
watch, don't you?

33:33.912 --> 33:35.381
You wanna get out of here?

33:35.414 --> 33:38.350
I live really close.

33:38.750 --> 33:41.187
I think that cast
on your arm is hot.

33:41.220 --> 33:43.522
I kinda wanna lick it.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.357
Um, I could use a drink.

33:45.391 --> 33:46.492
Yeah.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.560
I could use another drink, too.

33:48.594 --> 33:51.297
Why don't you boys go get
us another round, okay?

33:51.330 --> 33:52.698
Yeah yeah, but you know
I'm not gonna do this

33:52.731 --> 33:54.666
All night for free,
you know what I mean,

33:54.700 --> 33:56.835
Not for your health, baby.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.737
Yeah, that's really charming.

33:58.770 --> 34:01.473
You know what,
make mine a double.

34:03.309 --> 34:05.211
These guys are
especially douchey.

34:05.244 --> 34:06.378
I think we should
just get another drink

34:06.412 --> 34:08.947
And then we should roll out.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.283
Are you okay?

34:11.317 --> 34:12.851
I have my last
audition tomorrow.

34:12.884 --> 34:13.652
What?

34:13.685 --> 34:14.886
I'm quitting acting.

34:14.920 --> 34:15.987
God, not this again,
I mean can't we just

34:16.021 --> 34:17.389
Get drunk and have some fun?

34:17.422 --> 34:19.225
Candice, I'm serious,
if I get it, I'll get

34:19.257 --> 34:21.059
1500 dollars, and
I'll stick with it.

34:21.092 --> 34:22.161
If not, I'm done.

34:22.194 --> 34:23.228
Really?

34:23.262 --> 34:24.830
What are you gonna do?

34:24.862 --> 34:26.898
I can cut hair with you.

34:26.931 --> 34:27.998
At my shop?

34:28.033 --> 34:29.435
Yeah.

34:29.467 --> 34:31.002
Why would you want to work
there, I hate that place.

34:31.036 --> 34:33.172
Because you make
money and I don't.

34:33.205 --> 34:35.141
I think that you're
doing just fine.

34:35.174 --> 34:37.042
I mean look how nice
your apartment is.

34:37.074 --> 34:38.643
Candice, I got evicted.

34:38.677 --> 34:39.878
No you didn't.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.913
Now you can just keep
doing what you love.

34:41.947 --> 34:43.382
Candice, I don't love it.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.516
I don't love sitting in a
room full of pretty girls,

34:45.551 --> 34:47.119
Girls who would literally
kill me just so they

34:47.152 --> 34:48.420
Could have the part.

34:48.454 --> 34:49.955
You're just paying your dues.

34:49.987 --> 34:51.556
Paying my dues?

34:51.590 --> 34:53.759
It's all dues, it's only dues.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.428
I've been paying my dues
for the last 10 years.

34:56.462 --> 35:00.166
Baby girl, you're
like my blood, okay?

35:00.199 --> 35:02.368
I just don't have
your back on this.

35:02.401 --> 35:04.503
I just can't let you
give up on your dream.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.705
My dream is to be happy.

35:06.738 --> 35:10.142
And I haven't been
happy in a long time.

35:10.176 --> 35:13.078
Especially lately.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.980
You know, I sit in
that shop all day long

35:15.013 --> 35:19.318
Cutting hair while everyone
else is out in the world.

35:19.351 --> 35:20.786
And that's why I've
always loved you

35:20.819 --> 35:22.788
And respected you, Novi.

35:22.821 --> 35:25.056
Because you didn't give
up like I did, I mean,

35:25.090 --> 35:28.560
You fight and you claw
and you struggle every day

35:28.594 --> 35:31.297
So that you can keep
living your dream.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.965
Meanwhile, I sit in
a fucking box all day

35:33.999 --> 35:36.868
Cutting the hair of people
who are total assholes

35:36.902 --> 35:40.306
And making them look pretty.

35:43.074 --> 35:44.610
Here's your double,
you'll like that one.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.513
Oh, thanks.

35:47.546 --> 35:51.183
Uh, gimma peck
on the cheek first.

35:51.217 --> 35:53.719
Are you serious?

35:54.820 --> 35:56.488
Hey what the fuck?!

35:56.522 --> 35:58.490
Get off me!

35:58.524 --> 35:59.391
Cheers!

35:59.425 --> 36:02.160
Okay, sorry.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.935
You know what,
um, I've gotta pee.

36:09.968 --> 36:12.238
Yup, me too.

36:12.271 --> 36:13.739
Excuse me.

36:13.772 --> 36:15.607
Don't be gone too long.

36:15.641 --> 36:18.644
You'll make me sad.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.716
Are um, are you good?

36:24.750 --> 36:26.885
Yeah, I hate that bathroom.

36:26.918 --> 36:29.955
Okay, I'll b-r-b.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.862
Hey.

36:36.895 --> 36:39.030
Oh, hey Dr. Simon.

36:39.064 --> 36:40.332
How are you, Novella?

36:40.366 --> 36:42.100
You remembered my name.

36:42.133 --> 36:43.802
Of course, how could I
forget the one and only

36:43.835 --> 36:46.338
Novella McClure?

36:46.372 --> 36:47.939
By the way, I don't actually
have to go to the bathroom,

36:47.973 --> 36:51.109
I just, I saw you over here.

36:51.142 --> 36:52.344
Alright.

36:52.378 --> 36:53.512
Last time, I had to
go to the bathroom,

36:53.545 --> 36:57.148
But now we're standing
here, how are you?

36:58.016 --> 36:59.618
[Awkward laugh]
I'm okay.

36:59.651 --> 37:00.986
Great.

37:01.019 --> 37:03.522
What happened to your hand?

37:03.555 --> 37:05.824
Oh, car accident.

37:05.857 --> 37:06.958
How bad?

37:06.992 --> 37:08.327
This bad.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.662
Wow, yeah.

37:10.696 --> 37:13.031
Uh, hey so, before your
scary girlfriend comes back,

37:13.064 --> 37:17.135
I wanted to ask you out.

37:17.168 --> 37:20.071
Oh, wow, you just kinda
came out and said it.

37:20.105 --> 37:22.508
Yeah, I sure did, didn't I?

37:22.541 --> 37:24.476
I'm about as shocked as you are.

37:24.510 --> 37:27.713
Um, what do you think?

37:27.746 --> 37:29.981
Go get a cup of coffee,
or eat food together

37:30.015 --> 37:31.417
Or something.

37:31.450 --> 37:33.352
Um, sure, I'm kind
of drunk right now,

37:33.385 --> 37:35.086
So it might not
be the best time.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.254
Oh yeah yeah, of course.

37:36.288 --> 37:37.389
I didn't mean tonight,
I actually have

37:37.423 --> 37:41.092
A new patient in
the morning, so.

37:41.126 --> 37:42.561
I will give you my number.

37:42.594 --> 37:45.364
That way you don't have to
call if you don't want to.

37:45.397 --> 37:47.999
It's a win-win situation
for you, you know?

37:48.033 --> 37:51.069
Well I appreciate the
option, but I will call.

37:51.102 --> 37:53.038
Great.

37:53.071 --> 37:54.673
So what, you're boyfriend's...

37:54.706 --> 37:57.275
Oh god no, they're
just a tab for the night.

37:57.309 --> 37:59.010
Really?

37:59.044 --> 38:01.947
That's probably not the
safest way to get a drink.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.649
It's the cheapest though.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.417
(Laughing)

38:05.451 --> 38:06.952
Just so you know,
if we do go out,

38:06.985 --> 38:09.488
You can have whatever you want.

38:09.521 --> 38:12.424
You don't have to slip out
back afterwards, either.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.660
Sounds like a good plan to me.

38:14.693 --> 38:17.596
Okay, well I'm going to
quit while I'm still ahead.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.765
I will call you
soon, Dr. Simon.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.833
Talk to you then.

38:22.534 --> 38:25.203
Novella McClure.

38:47.292 --> 38:48.494
(Muffled voice from bathroom)

38:48.527 --> 38:50.962
Yeah, and now you can
go, just like I said.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.130
[Bathroom girl] It
took you long enough,

38:52.163 --> 38:53.298
Did you get it all?

38:53.331 --> 38:54.466
You wanna take
it outside, bitch?

38:54.500 --> 38:55.601
[Bathroom girl]
Fuck off, bitch!

38:55.634 --> 38:57.135
That's what I thought.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.570
Fucking bitch.

38:58.604 --> 38:59.905
Everything okay?

38:59.938 --> 39:01.106
Yeah, it's fine,
there's just some hipster

39:01.139 --> 39:02.408
Bitch in the bathroom
starting shit.

39:02.441 --> 39:05.343
Let's just go, come on.

39:06.044 --> 39:09.881
Uh, do you remember what...

39:09.915 --> 39:11.316
I know where the
car is, come here.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.652
It's this way.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.721
Oh.

39:15.754 --> 39:17.689
Those guys were
like stupid douchey.

39:17.723 --> 39:18.857
Well they were assholes.

39:18.890 --> 39:21.660
Dude, I feel pretty
drunk right now.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.294
Are you okay to drive?

39:23.328 --> 39:26.064
Yeah I just, well I
don't know, I feel kind of

39:26.097 --> 39:28.500
Fucked up, but just
give me the key.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.471
Shit.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.305
Me too.

39:34.339 --> 39:37.175
Oh, shit.

39:38.677 --> 39:43.682
(Muffled background noise)

39:46.284 --> 39:50.188
Something's wrong.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.557
There you are!

39:51.590 --> 39:52.791
Ha ha ha ha!

39:52.824 --> 39:54.325
I told you not to run
away from me, Stumpy.

39:54.359 --> 39:56.227
Candice, shit, we
have to get out of here!

39:56.261 --> 39:57.295
We've been buying
you little girls drinks

39:57.328 --> 39:58.497
All night long.

39:58.530 --> 40:00.666
And here you are,
trying to run out on us.

40:01.332 --> 40:03.034
Ron kind of figured
you were gonna do that.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.069
I thought you might
need a little something,

40:04.102 --> 40:06.337
Extra, to get you in the mood.

40:06.371 --> 40:07.906
Extra, extra!

40:07.939 --> 40:09.575
It'll be okay baby girl, okay?

40:09.608 --> 40:12.010
So remember when I said
I wanted to lick you?

40:12.043 --> 40:14.412
Well now you are gonna lick me.

40:14.446 --> 40:17.449
Rub along those teeth like
that, just brushin' 'em...

40:17.483 --> 40:18.850
Do what he says, okay?

40:18.884 --> 40:20.285
What?!

40:20.318 --> 40:21.419
I like this one.

40:21.453 --> 40:22.688
Fuck yeah!

40:22.721 --> 40:25.223
Oh, god I can't
wait to fuck you.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.758
It'll be fun, just
do what he says.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.193
Yeah, come on, just do it.

40:28.226 --> 40:32.898
Listen to your friend, come
on, come on just suck it.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.700
Suck it, slut!

40:34.733 --> 40:36.768
Here, allow me.

40:36.802 --> 40:41.239
Aaaahhhh!

40:42.541 --> 40:44.442
Novi, get in the car.

40:44.476 --> 40:47.045
(Novi screaming)

40:47.078 --> 40:48.313
Why did you do that?!

40:48.346 --> 40:49.548
I don't know, they
were fucking rapists,

40:49.581 --> 40:50.649
What the fuck was
I supposed to do?

40:50.682 --> 40:52.017
Could you at least tell me?

40:52.050 --> 40:53.919
It was kind of a
last-minute decision, Novella!

40:53.952 --> 40:55.687
Candice, we're
gonna get arrested!

40:55.721 --> 40:58.557
We're not gonna get
arrested, we're gonna go home!

40:58.590 --> 41:01.159
(Screaming)

41:01.192 --> 41:03.461
Oh my god!

41:03.795 --> 41:06.898
(Tires squealing)

41:06.932 --> 41:10.368
(Men moaning and screaming)

41:11.803 --> 41:16.608
(Faint police sirens)

41:32.758 --> 41:35.727
I still feel kinda woozy.

41:35.761 --> 41:37.729
Is it okay if I crash
in your bed tonight?

41:37.763 --> 41:39.998
You're supposed to, remember?

41:40.031 --> 41:41.567
Are you okay?

41:41.600 --> 41:43.268
You look kinda sick.

41:43.301 --> 41:45.270
What the fuck was that?

41:45.303 --> 41:48.406
You know that I carry a gun.

41:48.439 --> 41:50.108
Yeah but you never use it.

41:50.141 --> 41:54.613
Well I do when two assholes
are about to rape us!

41:54.880 --> 41:56.648
You know what?

41:56.682 --> 41:58.950
I really don't feel great.

41:58.984 --> 42:01.086
I'm just...

42:01.352 --> 42:03.989
I'm gonna go lay down.

42:04.022 --> 42:05.624
You're welcome?

42:05.657 --> 42:07.092
By the way.

42:07.125 --> 42:09.027
Yeah, thanks.

42:09.060 --> 42:11.162
Oh, ow.

42:12.964 --> 42:14.633
Ow.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.502
Ow.

42:20.038 --> 42:22.240
Candice!

42:22.273 --> 42:24.175
Ow.

42:29.447 --> 42:33.919
Candice, I need your help.

42:33.952 --> 42:35.520
What's wrong?

42:35.553 --> 42:37.723
I feel like I'm starving.

42:37.756 --> 42:40.759
Well go get something to eat.

42:40.792 --> 42:42.694
No, I think it's
worse than that.

42:42.728 --> 42:46.064
I need you to take
me to the hospital.

42:46.097 --> 42:49.234
Ugh, we'll go first
thing in the morning

42:49.267 --> 42:52.804
And we'll get burgers and stuff.

42:52.838 --> 42:55.641
No...

42:55.674 --> 42:58.977
Candice, wake up.

42:59.010 --> 43:00.245
God dammit!

43:00.278 --> 43:02.480
Wake up.

43:04.850 --> 43:09.755
(Novi sobbing and
breathing raggedly)

43:15.060 --> 43:17.729
Ow, ow!

43:18.596 --> 43:20.198
Ow!

43:20.866 --> 43:22.901
Ow!

43:23.702 --> 43:28.707
(Novi moaning and screaming)

43:32.410 --> 43:36.848
(Shrill static)

46:00.258 --> 46:02.894
Novi, be back at seven,
hope you're feeling better,

46:02.928 --> 46:05.396
Good luck at your audition.

46:06.031 --> 46:07.365
Audition?

46:07.398 --> 46:09.634
Fuck!

46:18.709 --> 46:23.614
(Ragged breathing)

46:34.525 --> 46:37.028
Novella?

46:55.246 --> 46:58.216
We, have been looking
forward to meeting you.

46:58.249 --> 47:00.385
Thanks, I've been looking
forward to this as well.

47:00.418 --> 47:02.387
Uh, I hope you don't
mind my asking, but uh,

47:02.420 --> 47:04.189
What happened to your hand?

47:04.222 --> 47:07.392
Oh, I was in a car
accident a few days ago.

47:07.425 --> 47:08.860
Jeez, is everything okay?

47:08.894 --> 47:11.096
Yeah, I just hurt
my arm and my foot.

47:11.129 --> 47:13.764
It's no big deal.

47:13.798 --> 47:15.400
Did it hurt your eyes?

47:15.433 --> 47:18.536
Oh, sorry.

47:19.104 --> 47:20.906
So, I explained a
little bit about this

47:20.939 --> 47:22.540
In the email, but
we're still looking

47:22.573 --> 47:25.243
For our lead actress and we
think you have the perfect look.

47:25.276 --> 47:26.344
Awesome.

47:26.377 --> 47:28.046
You did get the email, right?

47:28.079 --> 47:29.547
Sorry, I haven't read it yet.

47:29.580 --> 47:31.016
Oh, that's okay, it had
a couple sides in there

47:31.049 --> 47:33.151
For you to read, but you have
something prepared, right?

47:33.184 --> 47:35.186
Yeah, I have a
monologue I did for a play

47:35.220 --> 47:36.321
A few years back.

47:36.354 --> 47:39.857
Sounds awesome.

47:41.859 --> 47:44.896
(Novi sighs)

47:50.135 --> 47:53.871
They look at me
as if I'm not there.

47:53.905 --> 47:58.309
They listen to me
as if I don't speak.

47:58.343 --> 48:00.946
As I walk through the
darkness of my life,

48:00.979 --> 48:03.949
All I can hope for
is to find the light.

48:03.982 --> 48:07.418
No one knows who I
am, or what I can be.

48:07.452 --> 48:12.457
What I can become, only I do.

48:12.823 --> 48:14.960
And I fight, and
I climb, and I try

48:14.993 --> 48:17.262
With every ounce of
strength in my body

48:17.295 --> 48:19.931
To break down these walls.

48:19.965 --> 48:22.167
But it's never enough.

48:22.200 --> 48:25.470
My heart hammers at my chest,

48:25.503 --> 48:30.508
Begging to escape,
pounding so hard it hurts.

48:32.010 --> 48:37.015
It hurts unlike any pain
I've ever felt before.

48:37.582 --> 48:41.953
And I have felt a lot.

48:43.154 --> 48:46.457
One day I will show
the world who I am,

48:46.491 --> 48:50.996
Not the person they see,
but the person I am.

48:51.963 --> 48:55.100
I will find the light.

48:56.234 --> 48:59.170
They will see me.

48:59.204 --> 49:01.739
They will hear me.

49:05.376 --> 49:08.479
They will see me.

49:13.284 --> 49:16.988
(Laughing)

49:19.424 --> 49:21.592
That was amazing,
seriously, did Steve

49:21.626 --> 49:22.994
Put you up to this?

49:23.028 --> 49:24.429
Who's Steve?

49:24.462 --> 49:28.266
Oh, Novella honey, you
didn't get the email, did you?

49:28.299 --> 49:29.734
No, why?

49:29.767 --> 49:32.937
We're making Anal Alien 7,
not fucking Hamlet, sweetheart.

49:32.970 --> 49:34.039
I was a little excited
there for a second

49:34.072 --> 49:36.774
I was like, monologue
from a play?

49:36.807 --> 49:39.444
Fuck yeah, I love porno plays!

49:39.477 --> 49:41.246
Yeah, Novella.

49:41.279 --> 49:44.149
Do you do anal?

49:44.715 --> 49:49.654
(Sad music)

52:07.091 --> 52:08.058
Hi Novella.

52:08.092 --> 52:10.094
Hey Simon, what are you...

52:10.127 --> 52:10.895
Oh my god.

52:10.928 --> 52:12.129
It's okay, come on in.

52:12.163 --> 52:14.031
Jesus, I didn't
even think about this.

52:14.064 --> 52:15.900
It'll be alright, I promise.

52:15.933 --> 52:18.769
Step in my office, please.

52:19.136 --> 52:21.206
Fuck.

52:22.540 --> 52:25.343
Dr. Simon.

52:27.578 --> 52:30.047
Oh, shit.

52:30.548 --> 52:32.149
Can I get you
something to drink?

52:32.183 --> 52:33.618
No.

52:33.651 --> 52:35.119
Anything that would make
you feel more comfortable?

52:35.152 --> 52:38.256
I'm pretty sure nothing can
make this more comfortable.

52:38.289 --> 52:41.526
Fair enough.

52:44.262 --> 52:47.832
Okay, um, where to start?

52:47.865 --> 52:50.568
Simon, seriously,
I wasn't too thrilled

52:50.601 --> 52:52.036
About this whole
thing to begin with,

52:52.069 --> 52:55.139
And I know that I'm required
to talk with a shrink,

52:55.172 --> 52:57.808
But this isn't gonna work.

52:57.842 --> 53:00.278
Besides, I've had
the shittiest day...

53:00.311 --> 53:01.111
Okay, I know.

53:01.145 --> 53:03.948
I know.

53:03.981 --> 53:06.351
Look, I take suicide
patients from the hospital

53:06.384 --> 53:09.520
So rarely, but they
offer them to me, okay?

53:09.554 --> 53:11.822
They give me a list of
files, they ask if I want

53:11.856 --> 53:14.325
To take any of them on pro Bono.

53:14.359 --> 53:16.727
And I saw your name on the
list, I thought I could help.

53:16.761 --> 53:19.530
Well this isn't what I had
in mind for a first date.

53:19.564 --> 53:21.632
Me neither.

53:21.666 --> 53:23.568
Look I like you.

53:23.601 --> 53:26.871
I don't even know
you, and I like you.

53:27.538 --> 53:29.474
But when I saw that you
tried to kill yourself...

53:29.507 --> 53:31.909
I didn't try to kill myself.

53:31.942 --> 53:33.611
Right.

53:33.644 --> 53:37.014
Can of peaches try to take
a bite out of your arm?

53:37.047 --> 53:40.251
Novella, you're a
beautiful woman, alright?

53:40.285 --> 53:42.587
And I know we've only
talked a few times,

53:42.620 --> 53:46.657
But you're an incredible person.

53:47.292 --> 53:51.262
I help people, every day,
people who don't deserve it.

53:51.296 --> 53:53.564
You need help, alright
not because you're crazy

53:53.598 --> 53:56.367
Or suicidal, or
anything like that.

53:56.567 --> 53:59.404
I wanted to help you because
you should have never

53:59.437 --> 54:03.073
Felt like you needed
to leave this world.

54:03.974 --> 54:07.011
It's better with you in it.

54:10.515 --> 54:12.917
I rent this room
from the facility,

54:12.950 --> 54:15.085
It's not even
mine, that diploma,

54:15.119 --> 54:17.555
No idea whose that is.

54:18.022 --> 54:20.257
Are you hungry?

54:20.291 --> 54:22.293
Are you serious?

54:22.327 --> 54:23.761
Let's go grab some lunch.

54:23.794 --> 54:25.262
Just don't tell anyone.

54:25.296 --> 54:28.333
You like tacos?

54:28.366 --> 54:30.301
I love tacos.

54:30.335 --> 54:32.403
How much, though?

54:32.737 --> 54:34.872
Go grab some.

54:43.213 --> 54:45.015
So where do you live?

54:45.049 --> 54:47.117
I actually have a place
a few miles from here.

54:47.151 --> 54:49.420
It's an apartment attached
to my landlady's house.

54:49.454 --> 54:50.955
Live alone?

54:50.988 --> 54:53.691
Yeah, but my friend Candice
is staying with me right now.

54:53.724 --> 54:55.726
She's my suicide watch dog.

54:55.760 --> 54:57.428
Yeah, your scary
friend from the club.

54:57.462 --> 54:59.096
She's not scary.

54:59.129 --> 55:02.066
Are you kidding
me, she's terrifying!

55:02.099 --> 55:05.269
She's got bigger arms
than I do, and I work out.

55:05.302 --> 55:07.204
Sometimes.

55:07.237 --> 55:09.407
She's a sweetheart.

55:09.440 --> 55:12.743
Actually, she did shoot
two guys last night.

55:12.777 --> 55:14.879
What?!

55:14.912 --> 55:16.547
So Candice always carries
this gun in her purse,

55:16.581 --> 55:18.082
Just in case.

55:18.115 --> 55:19.650
Do you remember those guys we
were dancing with last night?

55:19.684 --> 55:21.051
Yeah.

55:21.085 --> 55:22.086
Well, they tried to rape
us in the parking lot,

55:22.119 --> 55:24.855
So Candice blew off their dicks.

55:24.889 --> 55:27.592
Oh my god!

55:28.526 --> 55:30.194
Oh, that's awful.

55:30.227 --> 55:31.529
But you can't say
anything, right, that whole

55:31.562 --> 55:32.963
Confidentiality thing?

55:32.997 --> 55:33.998
Oh, totally.

55:34.031 --> 55:36.434
Just eating tacos, anyway.

55:36.467 --> 55:38.503
Seriously, that's
fucked up, are you okay?

55:38.536 --> 55:42.573
Yeah, I mean Candice
always has my back.

55:42.607 --> 55:45.576
In fact buddy, better watch out.

55:45.610 --> 55:47.978
I got it!

55:48.012 --> 55:48.946
I was gonna offer
to talk to her, but

55:48.979 --> 55:50.548
I think I want to avoid her now.

55:50.581 --> 55:53.250
Yeah, that's
probably a good idea.

55:54.785 --> 55:57.021
So, this isn't so bad, right?

55:57.054 --> 55:59.023
Feel like you can talk
to me about things?

55:59.056 --> 56:00.525
It's better than
listening to some douchebag

56:00.558 --> 56:02.827
Talk all night just so I
can score a free drink.

56:02.860 --> 56:05.663
I bet.

56:06.163 --> 56:08.699
Wanna tell me what
happened to your arm?

56:08.733 --> 56:10.635
I've just been going
through a lot lately.

56:10.668 --> 56:12.202
Yeah, like what?

56:12.236 --> 56:14.972
I haven't landed a
role in over three years.

56:15.005 --> 56:16.507
How are you able to
pay for everything?

56:16.541 --> 56:18.743
I've had some
inheritance money saved up,

56:18.776 --> 56:21.946
And that well is
pretty much dry now.

56:21.979 --> 56:24.815
So, oh, and I got
in a car accident.

56:24.849 --> 56:26.016
Oh you really did
get in a car wreck?

56:26.050 --> 56:28.419
Yeah, that's what
happened to my foot.

56:28.453 --> 56:30.087
And when I got home,
my landlady told me

56:30.120 --> 56:32.022
I was gonna be evicted.

56:32.056 --> 56:37.061
So I don't know I just,
I just snapped, you know?

56:37.795 --> 56:40.865
I just bit my wrist
as hard as I could.

56:43.701 --> 56:45.970
You know, when things
start to pile up,

56:46.003 --> 56:50.040
It's good if you have
something you can count on

56:50.074 --> 56:51.509
To make you happy.

56:51.542 --> 56:54.044
A place you can go, a family
member you can talk to,

56:54.078 --> 56:57.882
Even a television show
you like to watch.

56:57.915 --> 56:59.283
Do you have anything like that?

56:59.316 --> 57:00.518
I don't know.

57:00.551 --> 57:01.318
Come on.

57:01.351 --> 57:02.553
How about acting?

57:02.587 --> 57:04.121
You know, a few years
ago I'd have probably

57:04.154 --> 57:06.657
Said yes, but I just...

57:09.093 --> 57:12.129
When I was younger, and
stupid shit would happen

57:12.162 --> 57:15.265
It didn't bother me because
I was young and stupid.

57:15.299 --> 57:18.302
But now that I'm older, it's
just not me anymore you know?

57:18.335 --> 57:19.504
Times change.

57:19.537 --> 57:21.371
Exactly.

57:21.405 --> 57:23.774
It's just not me.

57:23.808 --> 57:27.211
Maybe it's time
you start being you.

57:27.912 --> 57:31.381
I've been thinking that
a lot lately, actually.

57:31.682 --> 57:35.486
Speaking of which, I like you.

57:35.520 --> 57:37.955
Isn't that breaking some
sort of rule or something?

57:37.988 --> 57:38.923
I don't know, probably.

57:38.956 --> 57:40.958
No, definitely.

57:40.991 --> 57:43.494
It's true though, I like you.

57:43.528 --> 57:46.363
I talk to people all
day, I don't like them.

57:46.396 --> 57:48.533
You, I like.

57:48.566 --> 57:51.168
That's very sweet.

57:51.435 --> 57:52.903
What are you doing tonight?

57:52.937 --> 57:53.538
Tonight?

57:53.571 --> 57:55.005
Mmm-hmm.

57:55.039 --> 57:56.340
You gonna go to the club,
castrate a few more guys?

57:56.373 --> 57:58.342
I guess I could always
do that this weekend.

57:58.375 --> 57:59.710
Great!

57:59.744 --> 58:01.278
(Novi laughs)

58:01.311 --> 58:03.313
Have dinner with me, then.

58:05.616 --> 58:09.019
Actually, that sounds great.

58:29.874 --> 58:30.775
Hey there.

58:30.808 --> 58:32.109
Jeez!

58:32.142 --> 58:33.410
You scared me.

58:33.443 --> 58:34.612
Sorry.

58:34.645 --> 58:36.113
You're home early.

58:36.146 --> 58:40.384
Yeah, I just, I wanted to
talk to you about last night.

58:40.417 --> 58:41.886
Are you okay?

58:41.919 --> 58:43.420
Yeah, it was just
intense, I've never seen

58:43.453 --> 58:46.190
Anyone shot before, let alone
right in front of my face.

58:46.223 --> 58:50.060
I was talking about you
being sick last night.

58:50.094 --> 58:51.996
Fuck those guys.

58:52.029 --> 58:54.198
Me being sick?

58:54.231 --> 58:55.365
Last night?

58:55.399 --> 58:57.201
In the bathroom, you were sick?

58:57.234 --> 58:58.535
And then this morning I
tried to open the door

58:58.569 --> 59:00.237
And you locked yourself
in there, I mean

59:00.270 --> 59:01.305
Are you okay?

59:01.338 --> 59:03.007
Yeah it was just the ruffi.

59:03.040 --> 59:04.609
I'm sorry I didn't
take you to the hospital,

59:04.642 --> 59:07.578
I just got so fucked up
that I passed out, you know?

59:07.612 --> 59:08.979
It's cool.

59:09.013 --> 59:11.415
I mean those guys had
it coming, you know?

59:11.448 --> 59:13.784
I mean if anybody tries
to fuck with you or me

59:13.818 --> 59:15.385
Then I'll fuck 'em up.

59:15.419 --> 59:17.588
Clearly.

59:17.622 --> 59:20.090
Well yeah, clearly.

59:20.124 --> 59:22.760
I'm sorry, um, but do
you think that those guys

59:22.793 --> 59:25.229
Are ever going to fuck
with any girl ever again?

59:25.262 --> 59:27.998
Candice, I'm more worried
about being a wanted fugitive.

59:28.032 --> 59:30.367
I would love to hear that.

59:30.400 --> 59:34.304
Um, uh, these girls
tried to rob us, uh,

59:34.338 --> 59:35.973
In an alley, and we
didn't know what to do,

59:36.006 --> 59:39.610
So we just ran away with our
tails between our legs, uh...

59:39.644 --> 59:43.781
Okay, but if we get
busted, you're on your own.

59:44.649 --> 59:48.352
Novi, can we just forget
about this whole gun thing?

59:48.385 --> 59:51.656
It's not that big of a deal!

01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:10.440
Jesus.

01:00:10.474 --> 01:00:11.742
What happened to your foot?

01:00:11.776 --> 01:00:13.410
From the car accident.

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:14.779
You didn't tell me about that.

01:00:14.812 --> 01:00:16.013
I didn't?

01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:17.882
No, you didn't tell
me about your foot.

01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:19.316
Don't you think you
should see a doctor?

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:22.019
Candice, do you not understand
the concept of being broke?

01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:24.121
I have enough medical
bills to pay for.

01:00:24.154 --> 01:00:27.257
I don't know, Novi, your
foot looks kinda gangrene.

01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:29.359
I'll clean it later.

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:30.761
Eww.

01:00:30.795 --> 01:00:33.330
Gross.

01:00:33.363 --> 01:00:34.732
Are you going on a date?

01:00:34.765 --> 01:00:35.532
Yep.

01:00:35.565 --> 01:00:36.433
No shit, with who?

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:37.902
Dr. Simon.

01:00:37.935 --> 01:00:39.770
Who the fuck is Dr. Simon?

01:00:39.804 --> 01:00:41.872
The guy from the
club the other night.

01:00:41.906 --> 01:00:42.773
Hmm.

01:00:42.807 --> 01:00:44.975
I don't remember him.

01:00:45.009 --> 01:00:46.543
And if you're going on
a date, you should not

01:00:46.576 --> 01:00:49.546
Wear that dress, it makes your
sides flip out like a muffin.

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:52.983
Well get this.

01:00:53.017 --> 01:00:55.085
He's actually my doctor.

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:56.687
Your doctor.

01:00:56.721 --> 01:00:58.588
You hate doctors.

01:00:58.622 --> 01:01:01.291
Not my doctor
doctor, my shrink.

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:02.626
Huh.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:03.994
Is that like illegal
or something?

01:01:04.028 --> 01:01:05.963
I don't care.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:08.232
I didn't want to do that
therapy shit anyway.

01:01:08.265 --> 01:01:10.735
And he's sweet, he cares
about me, and I like

01:01:10.768 --> 01:01:13.738
Talking to him.

01:01:13.771 --> 01:01:15.605
I like that dress.

01:01:15.639 --> 01:01:17.341
You look really
hot in that dress.

01:01:17.374 --> 01:01:19.143
It's not weird, really.

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:22.379
And, he thinks I should
quit acting, too.

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:23.613
What?!

01:01:23.647 --> 01:01:24.815
Yeah.

01:01:24.849 --> 01:01:27.217
He agrees with me, it's
just not me anymore.

01:01:27.251 --> 01:01:32.356
So, are you just gonna
do whatever Simon says?

01:01:32.389 --> 01:01:34.191
I'm sorry, that's just
really bold of him to say

01:01:34.224 --> 01:01:36.927
Considering that he
barely even knows you.

01:01:36.961 --> 01:01:41.799
Well, maybe you
don't really know me.

01:01:44.068 --> 01:01:45.702
What the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

01:01:45.736 --> 01:01:46.937
Candice, I've been going
through a lot lately,

01:01:46.971 --> 01:01:50.107
And you don't really
seem to support me.

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.508
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:53.077
No, I'm not!

01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:55.379
Fucking amazing!

01:01:55.412 --> 01:01:57.547
I mean, really!

01:01:57.581 --> 01:01:58.916
You know what?

01:01:58.949 --> 01:02:01.318
Let me compose a list for you.

01:02:01.351 --> 01:02:04.488
When you tried to kill yourself,
who was there for you, me.

01:02:04.521 --> 01:02:06.957
And when you needed
someone to stay with you

01:02:06.991 --> 01:02:09.827
Every night this week,
who was there for you, me.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:12.562
And when two fucking
assholes tried to rape you

01:02:12.596 --> 01:02:15.265
In a back alley, who
was there for you, me!

01:02:15.299 --> 01:02:17.667
I know, Jesus, Candice!

01:02:17.701 --> 01:02:19.369
I've just gone through a
lot lately and I really

01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:22.572
Need you to support
me and you're not!

01:02:22.606 --> 01:02:24.474
I just need some space!

01:02:24.508 --> 01:02:26.076
Gimme some fucking room
to breathe, you're always

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:29.513
Fucking smothering me!

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.349
You know what?

01:02:32.382 --> 01:02:35.185
You can have your fucking space.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:37.822
Unbelievable.

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:42.759
God dammit!

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:52.702
(Ominous background noise)

01:03:59.303 --> 01:04:01.738
I'm sorry, I have
absolutely zero manners.

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:03.307
It's fine, really.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.409
I prefer it to
the salad-pickers.

01:04:05.442 --> 01:04:08.712
Yeah, I've always been an
eater, the more meat the better.

01:04:08.745 --> 01:04:11.648
Mmm, you from Texas?

01:04:11.916 --> 01:04:13.050
Bakersfield.

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:14.384
I am so sorry.

01:04:14.418 --> 01:04:15.319
I know, right?

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:16.653
How could you have ever left?

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:17.587
Tell me about it.

01:04:17.621 --> 01:04:19.123
It wasn't too bad though.

01:04:19.156 --> 01:04:20.157
It was just boring.

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:21.591
So, where's your family?

01:04:21.625 --> 01:04:23.727
Well, my mom left
when I was really young.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:24.962
Mmm-hmm.

01:04:24.995 --> 01:04:26.363
And my dad died a
few years after that.

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:28.298
He was getting a minor
operation and the doctors

01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:30.667
Screwed up and killed him.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.903
I'm sorry.

01:04:32.937 --> 01:04:34.804
Yeah.

01:04:34.838 --> 01:04:36.840
Is that where you
got your inheritance?

01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:39.944
It was a cash
settlement, actually.

01:04:39.977 --> 01:04:42.612
It's lasted me all these
years, but, you know

01:04:42.646 --> 01:04:45.349
I'd give it all away just
so I could have him back.

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:46.583
Absolutely.

01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:49.086
After that, I lived
with my aunt and uncle,

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:50.955
It was pretty awful.

01:04:50.988 --> 01:04:52.056
What?

01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:53.357
You know, the usual stuff.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:54.925
An abusive uncle.

01:04:54.959 --> 01:04:56.660
Something that will give
us plenty to talk about

01:04:56.693 --> 01:04:58.128
In a session someday.

01:04:58.162 --> 01:05:01.098
Good, I'll look
forward to it then.

01:05:01.131 --> 01:05:02.466
So what'd you do today?

01:05:02.499 --> 01:05:05.435
Mmm, I had another
patient for an hour

01:05:05.469 --> 01:05:07.337
And then I went home.

01:05:07.371 --> 01:05:08.772
You?

01:05:08.805 --> 01:05:11.741
I went home, I actually
got in a fight with Candice.

01:05:11.775 --> 01:05:13.243
About what?

01:05:13.277 --> 01:05:16.346
I don't know, she
can kinda be annoying.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.881
How long you two been friends?

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:19.383
Since that creepy uncle.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:21.351
She helped me run away from him.

01:05:21.385 --> 01:05:23.153
Sounds like she's
a real friend.

01:05:23.187 --> 01:05:24.888
Yeah.

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.523
She's pretty badass.

01:05:26.556 --> 01:05:29.293
She always has my back.

01:05:32.296 --> 01:05:35.099
How do you feel about dessert?

01:05:35.132 --> 01:05:39.036
Just, scale of one to 10.

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:40.070
I'd love to.

01:05:40.104 --> 01:05:41.238
Yeah?

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:42.439
It's actually, it's not here.

01:05:42.472 --> 01:05:45.242
I'm sure it's wonderful here.

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:47.144
Do you trust me?

01:05:47.177 --> 01:05:48.245
What is it?

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:49.879
Life-changing is what it is.

01:05:49.913 --> 01:05:52.282
(Novi laughs)

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:54.985
Sure.

01:05:57.554 --> 01:05:58.822
Viola!

01:05:58.855 --> 01:06:00.257
Oh my god.

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:02.326
I told you, they're
worth waiting for.

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:03.893
Will I appreciate
these even though

01:06:03.927 --> 01:06:05.762
I'm kind of drunk?

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:10.800
Novella, darling, the dead
can appreciate these cookies.

01:06:12.136 --> 01:06:13.703
Here.

01:06:13.737 --> 01:06:15.305
Woo!

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:16.540
Still a little hot, careful.

01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:18.775
Thank you.

01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:21.578
Hold on!

01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:27.451
Together.

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:28.952
Mmm!

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.156
Mmm.

01:06:33.957 --> 01:06:36.093
Mmm.

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:50.807
(Wistful music)

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:51.235
Oh my god.

01:07:51.268 --> 01:07:53.370
What?

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:57.207
(Shrill static)

01:08:17.661 --> 01:08:20.729
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:08:22.166 --> 01:08:24.401
You okay?

01:08:25.769 --> 01:08:28.772
Yeah, I just had a bad dream.

01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:32.442
Good.

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:35.312
We can talk about it
in our session today.

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:38.848
You still want me to come in?

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:42.652
Sure, why not?

01:08:45.054 --> 01:08:46.256
I have a few appointments
in the morning,

01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:49.292
But then maybe we can
spend the day together.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:52.996
Okay, sounds great.

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:19.323
Novi, baby, how are you?

01:09:19.356 --> 01:09:21.024
Hey Eesha, how are you?

01:09:21.057 --> 01:09:23.091
Oh, I'm fine.

01:09:23.126 --> 01:09:25.127
Did you have a long night?

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:27.331
I did.

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:28.898
Were you with a boy?

01:09:28.932 --> 01:09:31.067
I was, I was indeed.

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.336
Is he handsome?

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:33.803
Oh, very.

01:09:33.837 --> 01:09:35.439
So, what does he do?

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:36.506
He's a psychiatrist.

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:37.774
A doctor!

01:09:37.807 --> 01:09:41.578
Oh my Novi, I am
so happy for you.

01:09:41.611 --> 01:09:43.179
Thanks, I really like him.

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:45.649
I bet you are, and it's
about time that we had

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:48.252
Some little grandbabies
running around here.

01:09:48.285 --> 01:09:50.420
I think so, too.

01:09:50.453 --> 01:09:52.055
Have you ever
decorated a baby?

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:54.324
It's so much fun.

01:09:54.558 --> 01:09:56.426
What's wrong with
you, you little shit?

01:09:56.460 --> 01:10:01.030
He gets really jealous when
I talk about grandchildren.

01:10:01.064 --> 01:10:02.432
I bet he does.

01:10:02.466 --> 01:10:05.535
Well, I need to go but,
if boyfriend comes over,

01:10:05.569 --> 01:10:07.804
Be sure to introduce him to me.

01:10:07.837 --> 01:10:09.873
I must approve.

01:10:09.906 --> 01:10:11.941
I will.

01:10:11.975 --> 01:10:13.310
Bye, Eesha.

01:10:13.343 --> 01:10:15.279
Bye, Novi.

01:10:17.146 --> 01:10:19.616
Come on, come on.

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:27.424
Well well, look who's
doing the walk of shame.

01:10:27.457 --> 01:10:32.228
Hey, don't hate
the playa baby.

01:10:32.262 --> 01:10:33.663
I came home last
night and you were gone

01:10:33.697 --> 01:10:35.699
And I got kind of worried.

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:36.800
Seriously?

01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:38.234
Yeah.

01:10:38.268 --> 01:10:39.403
You made me realize that
sometimes I can just kind of

01:10:39.436 --> 01:10:41.405
Freak out about stuff, you know?

01:10:41.438 --> 01:10:43.840
Uh, yeah, I know.

01:10:43.873 --> 01:10:46.876
I don't know, I just...

01:10:47.344 --> 01:10:50.246
I don't know, sometimes
I just feel like I...

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.382
You know what, I don't know.

01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:57.921
I know.

01:10:59.188 --> 01:11:02.158
I'll try to lay off.

01:11:02.191 --> 01:11:03.627
Thanks.

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.662
Do you like him?

01:11:05.695 --> 01:11:08.365
He's amazing.

01:11:08.398 --> 01:11:10.233
And he bakes cookies.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:11.801
Really?

01:11:11.835 --> 01:11:13.202
Are they any good?

01:11:13.236 --> 01:11:16.373
Life-changing.

01:11:17.441 --> 01:11:21.745
Well, if you like
him then I like him.

01:11:24.514 --> 01:11:26.282
So I was talking to Sara
at the shop the other day.

01:11:26.316 --> 01:11:28.385
And I told her that
you like to do my hair,

01:11:28.418 --> 01:11:29.686
You know what she said?

01:11:29.719 --> 01:11:31.154
What?

01:11:31.187 --> 01:11:32.322
That you can come by the
shop whenever you want to

01:11:32.356 --> 01:11:33.189
And take a look around.

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:33.990
Are you serious?

01:11:34.023 --> 01:11:35.425
Yeah, totally serious.

01:11:35.459 --> 01:11:37.727
Thank you so much.

01:11:38.362 --> 01:11:39.596
What are you doing home?

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:40.964
I have off work.

01:11:40.997 --> 01:11:43.299
I thought I'd go on
a hike or go shopping

01:11:43.333 --> 01:11:46.035
Or some shit like
that in a little bit.

01:11:46.736 --> 01:11:49.138
Do you wanna go?

01:11:49.172 --> 01:11:53.076
Well I do, but Simon and I
are gonna go grab some lunch.

01:11:53.109 --> 01:11:54.678
Right.

01:11:54.711 --> 01:11:55.845
You guys are totally
still in your

01:11:55.879 --> 01:11:57.414
Honeymoon phase, aren't you?

01:11:57.447 --> 01:11:59.849
Yeah, I guess we are.

01:12:01.217 --> 01:12:03.353
I'm happy for you.

01:12:03.387 --> 01:12:05.955
Thanks, I am happy.

01:12:05.989 --> 01:12:06.990
But seriously, if
he breaks your heart

01:12:07.023 --> 01:12:08.558
I'll fucking kill him.

01:12:08.592 --> 01:12:09.393
(Novi laughs)

01:12:09.426 --> 01:12:10.394
I will!

01:12:10.427 --> 01:12:13.062
I'm serious!

01:12:13.096 --> 01:12:16.265
I know you would.

01:12:32.482 --> 01:12:35.619
Are you following me?

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:39.122
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:12:39.155 --> 01:12:41.124
I'm meeting someone.

01:12:41.157 --> 01:12:42.091
Who?

01:12:42.125 --> 01:12:43.660
Simon?

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:45.028
Yeah.

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:46.530
Like, for an appointment?

01:12:46.563 --> 01:12:47.597
Sort of.

01:12:47.631 --> 01:12:50.700
We're kind of seeing each other.

01:12:51.234 --> 01:12:52.168
(Tracy laughs)

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.703
Why are you laughing?

01:12:53.737 --> 01:12:55.371
You're kidding me, right?

01:12:55.405 --> 01:12:57.273
No, I'm not.

01:12:57.306 --> 01:12:58.842
Then what are you doing here?

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:01.478
I have an appointment
in an hour, and I had

01:13:01.511 --> 01:13:05.014
Nothing else to do so I
thought I'd come here early.

01:13:05.849 --> 01:13:07.951
Did you try to kill yourself?

01:13:07.984 --> 01:13:09.819
No, I didn't.

01:13:09.853 --> 01:13:11.287
Why would you do that?

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:12.121
I didn't!

01:13:12.155 --> 01:13:13.156
Yes, you did.

01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:14.323
Why?

01:13:14.357 --> 01:13:15.525
Tracy, I didn't
try to kill myself,

01:13:15.559 --> 01:13:16.860
Why do you think I
tried to kill myself?

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:18.962
Because I...

01:13:20.764 --> 01:13:23.199
I tried to kill myself.

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:24.801
Last year.

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:27.370
That's when I
started seeing Simon.

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:29.906
Why would you try
to kill yourself?

01:13:29.939 --> 01:13:31.541
I asked you first.

01:13:31.575 --> 01:13:33.409
Because my life sucks.

01:13:33.443 --> 01:13:34.911
So does mine.

01:13:34.944 --> 01:13:36.646
Your life is amazing.

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:39.048
You get all the roles,
and you're beautiful.

01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:41.951
God, I wish I had half as
much success as you do.

01:13:41.985 --> 01:13:44.454
And you're 10 years
younger than me.

01:13:44.488 --> 01:13:48.191
I haven't gotten a
part since I moved here.

01:13:48.224 --> 01:13:49.593
What are you talking about?

01:13:49.626 --> 01:13:51.160
I haven't.

01:13:51.194 --> 01:13:54.397
I just say I do.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:55.965
It makes me feel better.

01:13:55.999 --> 01:13:57.901
So then why do all the
casting directors and producers

01:13:57.934 --> 01:14:02.071
Request you, why do
you have an agent?

01:14:02.105 --> 01:14:04.774
Because.

01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:10.213
I do everything you say I do.

01:14:10.246 --> 01:14:11.515
What?

01:14:11.548 --> 01:14:15.251
I uh, I sleep with them.

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:20.289
And they always say
they'll give me the part,

01:14:20.490 --> 01:14:23.392
And they never do.

01:14:23.426 --> 01:14:25.595
They just use me.

01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:27.831
Ugh, I'm disgusting.

01:14:28.231 --> 01:14:29.465
No you're not, don't say that.

01:14:29.499 --> 01:14:34.103
Yes, I am, I disgust myself.

01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:37.874
And that's probably why I try
to cut you down all the time,

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:41.778
Because you're so much
stronger than I am.

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:43.813
No I'm not, trust me.

01:14:43.847 --> 01:14:46.516
Yes, you are.

01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:49.385
But I never would
have thought you would

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:51.120
Give in to Simon.

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:53.022
What do you mean?

01:14:53.056 --> 01:14:55.592
His game.

01:14:55.625 --> 01:14:57.661
What are you talking about?

01:14:57.694 --> 01:15:00.530
Oh no, oh no.

01:15:00.564 --> 01:15:01.598
- What...
- I'm sorry.

01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:02.465
What are you talking about?

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:03.232
Nothing.

01:15:03.266 --> 01:15:04.167
Tracy, tell me!

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.069
Simon does this all the time.

01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:07.637
Does what?

01:15:07.671 --> 01:15:10.039
Okay, he calls the
hospital, he asks for

01:15:10.073 --> 01:15:11.841
Suicidal girls.

01:15:11.875 --> 01:15:13.777
Then he pretends
he's Prince Charming,

01:15:13.810 --> 01:15:15.745
And he sleeps with them.

01:15:15.779 --> 01:15:18.181
I heard him telling
his friends about it.

01:15:18.214 --> 01:15:20.483
No, that's not true.

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:21.785
Simon and I knew
each other way before

01:15:21.818 --> 01:15:23.486
I ever started coming here.

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:25.454
Then that's probably
why he picked you.

01:15:25.488 --> 01:15:27.624
No Tracy, he didn't pick me.

01:15:27.657 --> 01:15:29.058
This is different!

01:15:29.092 --> 01:15:31.494
Novella, I'm not
trying to be mean.

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:32.696
I'm sorry.

01:15:32.729 --> 01:15:34.163
Then why do you
keep coming here?

01:15:34.197 --> 01:15:37.533
Because, he
makes me feel good.

01:15:37.567 --> 01:15:40.804
All the other guys
don't even talk to me.

01:15:40.837 --> 01:15:43.506
At least he pretends I'm
there when we're having sex.

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:44.808
Oh my god.

01:15:44.841 --> 01:15:45.842
This isn't happening.

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:47.043
Novella, I'm so sorry.

01:15:47.076 --> 01:15:48.978
Shut up, Tracy!

01:15:49.012 --> 01:15:50.179
If it makes you feel...

01:15:50.213 --> 01:15:51.314
Shut the fuck up
you fucking slut!

01:15:51.347 --> 01:15:53.449
You're fucking lying to me!

01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:55.451
Fuck you!

01:15:56.586 --> 01:15:58.655
What the hell is going on?

01:15:58.688 --> 01:16:01.157
Why are you crying?

01:16:01.457 --> 01:16:05.762
(Ominous background music)

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:11.701
(Novella screams and sobs)

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:31.788
(Retching)

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:02.185
What the fuck is
wrong with you?!

01:17:02.218 --> 01:17:05.521
(Indistinct yelling)

01:17:45.494 --> 01:17:47.396
Is this a dream?

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:55.104
This is a dream.

01:18:00.744 --> 01:18:03.246
What the fuck did you do to me?

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:06.315
What the fuck did you do to me?!

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:09.052
What did I do to you?

01:18:09.085 --> 01:18:10.419
Are you kidding me?

01:18:10.453 --> 01:18:11.287
Let me go!

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.621
Let me go now!

01:18:12.655 --> 01:18:15.725
Novi, just stop,
okay, just stop.

01:18:15.759 --> 01:18:16.926
No you just stop!

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:18.127
You're not my fucking
mother, you're not

01:18:18.161 --> 01:18:20.864
My fucking sister,
you're fucking nobody!

01:18:20.897 --> 01:18:22.031
Why don't you just
go cut someone's hair

01:18:22.065 --> 01:18:26.803
Or fucking shoot
someone, you psycho!

01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:30.539
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:18:31.775 --> 01:18:35.211
(Novi sobs)

01:18:35.244 --> 01:18:38.147
Shhh, shhh it's okay.

01:18:38.748 --> 01:18:41.050
It's okay.

01:18:41.084 --> 01:18:42.418
Candice.

01:18:46.022 --> 01:18:48.892
I'm so fucked up.

01:18:52.361 --> 01:18:55.999
Candice, I'm a fucking lunatic.

01:18:56.432 --> 01:19:00.003
I can't live like this
anymore, I just can't.

01:19:00.036 --> 01:19:03.172
Why did you do
this to yourself?

01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:10.313
Dr. Simon.

01:19:10.546 --> 01:19:12.916
What happened?

01:19:13.682 --> 01:19:17.186
He used me, just like
everyone else does.

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:19.255
What do you mean?

01:19:19.288 --> 01:19:20.523
He fucked me because
that's what he does

01:19:20.556 --> 01:19:22.291
With every girl he meets.

01:19:22.325 --> 01:19:24.193
Just like every
director or producer,

01:19:24.227 --> 01:19:28.431
Or any guy with a fucking
dick between his legs!

01:19:29.866 --> 01:19:31.067
Novi?

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:32.635
I'll be right back, okay?

01:19:32.668 --> 01:19:35.404
No, Candice don't leave
me, I'm gonna fucking

01:19:35.438 --> 01:19:37.206
Bleed to death.

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.508
Just, here.

01:19:39.542 --> 01:19:41.911
If you need to call someone
or anything, the phone's

01:19:41.945 --> 01:19:44.948
Right there okay,
I'll be right back.

01:19:44.981 --> 01:19:46.182
Candice!

01:19:46.215 --> 01:19:47.851
No, don't leave me!

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:49.953
Novi, I'm gonna take
care of everything, okay?

01:19:49.986 --> 01:19:51.855
Don't worry,
everything will be...

01:19:51.888 --> 01:19:52.956
It'll be fine.

01:19:52.989 --> 01:19:54.690
Okay?

01:19:54.891 --> 01:19:58.928
Candice, no!

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:09.873
(Phone vibrating)

01:20:17.546 --> 01:20:19.215
Hello?

01:20:19.248 --> 01:20:21.384
Novella?

01:20:22.185 --> 01:20:24.253
Novella?

01:20:24.587 --> 01:20:25.922
Hello?

01:20:25.955 --> 01:20:27.756
Novella?

01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:30.559
Simon, I need your help.

01:20:32.561 --> 01:20:35.131
What happened
today, where were you?

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:39.035
I know everything.

01:20:39.068 --> 01:20:40.937
You're using me.

01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:44.440
What?

01:20:44.473 --> 01:20:46.442
I know you were just
using me to fuck me.

01:20:46.475 --> 01:20:47.843
I know you don't
even care about me,

01:20:47.877 --> 01:20:50.213
You probably don't even like me.

01:20:50.246 --> 01:20:52.848
Tracy told me everything.

01:20:52.882 --> 01:20:55.084
Oh god, Novella, listen.

01:20:55.118 --> 01:20:57.987
Tracy has been a patient
of mine for two years.

01:20:58.021 --> 01:20:59.956
She's a pathological liar.

01:20:59.989 --> 01:21:02.391
No, I'm done with
your bullshit, Simon.

01:21:02.425 --> 01:21:05.394
Novella, just listen!

01:21:05.428 --> 01:21:07.863
She tells her friends that
she's this popular actress,

01:21:07.897 --> 01:21:11.234
She tells people she
tried to kill herself.

01:21:11.267 --> 01:21:14.037
She also tells people that
we've been involved, sexually.

01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:16.205
It's all lies.

01:21:16.239 --> 01:21:18.874
I'll show you my client
list Novella, there's you,

01:21:18.908 --> 01:21:22.811
Tracy, and umm, a
woman in her 50s.

01:21:22.845 --> 01:21:25.982
Other than you three, I
have five male patients.

01:21:26.015 --> 01:21:27.850
Oh shit.

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:29.185
What's wrong?

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:31.887
I'm sorry!

01:21:31.921 --> 01:21:33.622
Simon, I need your
help, I'm in big t...

01:21:33.656 --> 01:21:35.724
Hold on, god dammit,
hang on sweetie, there's

01:21:35.758 --> 01:21:38.827
Some kind of breakdown
at the ward here.

01:21:38.861 --> 01:21:40.696
No Simon, please!

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:42.631
Just two seconds, I'll
call you right back.

01:21:42.665 --> 01:21:44.367
No Simon, please!

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.634
Please, no Simon!

01:21:45.668 --> 01:21:47.670
Don't, oh shit!

01:21:47.703 --> 01:21:49.605
No!

01:21:52.541 --> 01:21:54.377
Fuck!

01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:56.245
Oh, shit!

01:21:57.113 --> 01:21:58.948
Simon...

01:21:58.982 --> 01:22:02.185
(Novi sobs)

01:22:30.813 --> 01:22:33.182
Where did you go?

01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:36.252
What are you doing?

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:37.987
There you go, baby girl.

01:22:38.021 --> 01:22:40.889
I got it all taken
care of for ya.

01:22:40.923 --> 01:22:42.158
Oh don't worry about it.

01:22:42.191 --> 01:22:44.093
Candice, what is that?

01:22:44.127 --> 01:22:46.562
(Candice grunting)

01:22:48.331 --> 01:22:50.799
Now you have
something to eat, huh?

01:22:50.833 --> 01:22:54.437
(Novi screaming)

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:57.273
What the fuck did you do,
Candice, what did you do?!

01:22:57.306 --> 01:22:58.941
You killed him, I loved him!

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:00.409
Well I thought you ate people!

01:23:00.443 --> 01:23:01.677
I'm not a cannibal!

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:03.846
Well then what
the fuck are you?!

01:23:03.879 --> 01:23:05.214
(Knocking)

01:23:05.248 --> 01:23:08.017
Oh, ow!

01:23:21.097 --> 01:23:22.498
Candice, right?

01:23:22.531 --> 01:23:23.066
Yeah.

01:23:23.099 --> 01:23:24.533
Yep.

01:23:24.567 --> 01:23:26.735
Is everything okay here,
I heard a terrible scream.

01:23:26.769 --> 01:23:27.836
You know, everything's fine.

01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:28.504
Thank you.

01:23:28.537 --> 01:23:30.339

01:23:30.373 --> 01:23:33.042
Everything's fine, it's

01:23:33.076 --> 01:23:34.977

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:37.213

01:23:37.246 --> 01:23:39.014

01:23:40.716 --> 01:23:42.318
You're not coming

01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:44.420

to call the police.

01:24:29.798 --> 01:24:33.336

01:24:36.972 --> 01:24:41.344
Why do you do this to me?

01:24:43.446 --> 01:24:46.282
