WEBVTT

00:26.235 --> 00:28.237
[people chattering]

00:28.946 --> 00:30.531
This coastal cleanup...

00:30.822 --> 00:31.990
is just the beginning.

00:32.491 --> 00:37.204
The mayor's environmental initiative
is the biggest campaign of its kind.

00:37.454 --> 00:40.666
Now there are more
than 300,000 public employees in New York,

00:40.749 --> 00:42.751
and we're planning to enlist them all

00:42.960 --> 00:45.087
to create an army
of environmental warriors

00:45.504 --> 00:47.422
because this city is at war.

00:47.506 --> 00:50.133
It's a war against waste and pollution

00:50.259 --> 00:52.553
-and global warming.
-Oh, my God!

00:54.012 --> 00:55.430
I understand how she feels.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.891
It's shocking to see how much trash

00:57.975 --> 01:00.269
and litter you will find
along this shoreline.

01:00.352 --> 01:01.478
Wait, don't touch it!

01:01.645 --> 01:03.313
[people gasp]

01:03.522 --> 01:05.232
Some people are more sensitive
than others.

01:05.315 --> 01:06.483
[woman] Dr. Roundie!

01:13.740 --> 01:14.575
What's that?

01:18.287 --> 01:21.331
Okay people, we've ID'd the body.
Her name was Beth Landau.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.208
The ME just released
the preliminary  report.

01:23.292 --> 01:25.752
[Alvin]
Excuse me. We're not quite finished here.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.881
Lt. Caruso, I presume. Dr. Alvin Roundie,

01:29.965 --> 01:32.342
I'm with the Mayor's
environmental initiative.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.469
-I'm sorry we started without you.
-No, I'm sorry.

01:34.553 --> 01:37.723
We might have to reschedule
because this is a murder investigation.

01:38.390 --> 01:39.224
You were there.

01:40.183 --> 01:43.937
But this is a murder investigation, too.
This is the murder of planet Earth.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.357
I was just reviewing
our new recycling policy.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.900
Now, it couldn't be simpler.

01:49.693 --> 01:52.195
Yellow is paper, not cardboard.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.197
Red is cardboard, not paper.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.907
Green, clear bottles.

01:55.991 --> 01:57.701
Lavender, glass bottles.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.494
Coral is organic waste,

01:59.578 --> 02:01.079
blue is clear glass

02:01.246 --> 02:03.332
and Pacific blue is metal.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.750
If you get confused,

02:04.833 --> 02:07.252
you can always refer to the chart.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.213
-Thank God there's a chart.
-Yes, well, thank you very much.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.798
I'm sure we all want to do our part.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.759
One last item, I'm almost done.

02:13.842 --> 02:17.721
Now, you can goodbye
to your plastic trash bags.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.057
We are replacing them with these:

02:20.182 --> 02:24.436
Triple-ply, biodegradable paper bags.

02:25.270 --> 02:28.357
I'm way ahead of you.
"They're paper bags, won't they leak?"

02:28.482 --> 02:31.318
Okay, there may be some seepage,

02:31.401 --> 02:35.447
but it is a small price to pay
to avoid this:

02:36.031 --> 02:37.741
[factory machinery working]

02:38.492 --> 02:40.327
Say hello to the devil.

02:41.328 --> 02:45.499
This country uses
380 billion plastic trash bags a year.

02:45.582 --> 02:46.625
I love trash talk.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.960
Each bag is part of a single roll

02:49.044 --> 02:50.462
of polyethylene films,

02:50.587 --> 02:52.798
Three millimeters thick, 800 feet--

02:53.131 --> 02:55.300
[TJ] Okay, thank you very much, Doctor.

02:55.384 --> 02:58.011
You've given us a lot to think about,
and we appreciate it.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.221
Any other questions?

03:00.889 --> 03:01.973
No? Okay.

03:02.057 --> 03:05.686
Well, thanks again and here is my card.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.980
Be careful with that. It's tissue paper.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.150
-Which one is paper?
-The yellow one.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.611
[TJ] Okay, as I was saying,
our Jane Doe has a name:

03:14.695 --> 03:17.614
Beth Landau.
Cause of death, blunt force trauma.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.741
[Cora] Sounds impulsive, not premeditated.

03:20.117 --> 03:24.037
Either way, he was smart, methodical.
Took his time, scrubbed the body.

03:24.413 --> 03:27.666
-No prints or fibers anywhere.
-What about the trash bags she was in?

03:27.749 --> 03:30.669
Forty-two gallon contractor bags.
Black plastic, untraceable.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.130
At least we know
Professor Ponytail didn't do it.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.590
He cut her fingernails.
Right hand, not the left.

03:35.674 --> 03:36.675
I noticed that, too.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.428
-Maybe she scratched him.
-Good for her.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.431
She worked for Richie Knight?

03:44.015 --> 03:46.393
-What?
-Yeah. She was his personal assistant

03:46.476 --> 03:48.562
for the past three years.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.022
I love Richie Knight.

03:51.857 --> 03:55.110
<i>Welcome Home</i> got me through middle school.
He was the father I wished I had.

03:55.193 --> 03:58.113
[Ryan] He was everybody's father.
Have you guys seen <i>The Little Dipper?</i>

03:58.196 --> 04:00.782
I love that movie.
I've seen it a dozen times.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.703
-I don't like it. [shouts] I love it!
-I love it!

04:04.786 --> 04:06.121
[both laugh]

04:06.246 --> 04:09.249
-That curly thing on his hair...
-Bopped her in the face...

04:09.374 --> 04:10.876
[all laughing]

04:12.335 --> 04:15.338
Yeah look, maybe you should call him.
I hear he needs a new personal assistant.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.424
[policemen chattering]

04:18.508 --> 04:19.718
Not cool, man.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.097
Alright, well...

04:25.182 --> 04:26.266
as I was saying...

04:28.185 --> 04:29.311
[huffs] blunt force trauma...

04:32.939 --> 04:35.942
-[Cora] And how are you?
-[woman] Still hasn't sunk in, I guess.

04:36.109 --> 04:39.571
-She only lived here for three months.
-Was she seeing anyone?

04:39.905 --> 04:42.991
No, Bethie wasn't a big dater.
She worked 15-hour days.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.284
Richie kept her so busy.

04:44.367 --> 04:45.452
[police siren]

04:45.619 --> 04:46.745
Did you ever meet him?

04:46.828 --> 04:48.789
Twice. Bethie brought me backstage.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.041
He's so funny.
He's even funnier in person.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.627
-Oh, my God. He kills me.
-Have you seen his stand-up?

04:53.710 --> 04:56.338
I know. What is it about funny guys?

04:56.421 --> 04:59.633
[woman] I know! Even a total loser.
If he can make you laugh, right?

04:59.716 --> 05:03.553
-[Cora] It's like--
-What exactly did she do for Mr. Knight?

05:04.304 --> 05:06.014
Research, mostly. For his memoirs.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.474
She really loved her job.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.184
Until about a week ago.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.477
What happened then?

05:10.769 --> 05:13.230
Well, she wouldn't say, but...

05:13.897 --> 05:16.274
she started calling in sick,
which she never did, and...

05:16.358 --> 05:17.943
she seemed really nervous.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.821
No, please don't open that.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.370
-Can I smell that?
-No. You may not.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.789
-Can I see it?
-Nope.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.458
I outrank you. You know that.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.794
-Put that away.
-Thank you. [clears throat]

05:40.090 --> 05:42.425
<i>-How long have you been a musician?</i>
<i>-About a year.</i>

05:42.509 --> 05:43.677
What are we watching?

05:44.135 --> 05:47.264
-Richie Knight? Since when?
<i>-</i>Caught a case this morning.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.723
His assistant was murdered.

05:48.807 --> 05:53.019
Who's assistant? Richie Knight's?
Holy moly. That's huge.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.647
-Do you like him?
-I never really watch him.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.608
No, I mean, do you like him for the case?

05:58.692 --> 06:00.819
-Did he do it?
-I don't know. Maybe.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.988
She was on her way to meet him
when she disappeared.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.073
We're meeting with him tomorrow.
Cora's so excited.

06:05.156 --> 06:07.075
She left work early,
she's getting her hair done.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.118
Do me a favor.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.704
When you see him,
ask him about my audition demo.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.205
Your what?

06:12.289 --> 06:15.208
He does this segment
called "Take Your Best Shot." This is it.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.626
It's on now. Here, take a look.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.794
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

06:17.878 --> 06:20.797
<i>This is the five of diamonds.</i>

06:21.089 --> 06:22.090
You sent him a tape?

06:22.465 --> 06:25.844
I submitted that video of me singing
at Aunt Angie's wedding.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.929
You were there.
They wouldn't let me off the stage.

06:28.013 --> 06:31.266
I'm not gonna ask about a demo tape.
He's a material witness in a homicide.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.311
-Maybe it'll come up organically.
-How is it going to come up?

06:34.644 --> 06:37.647
I don't know.
Maybe he'll say, "Lieutenant,

06:37.731 --> 06:39.566
the only thing I know for sure
about the victim

06:39.649 --> 06:41.985
was she really loved the song
'As Long As I'm Singing'."

06:42.068 --> 06:43.111
And then you might say,

06:43.194 --> 06:45.322
"What a remarkable
coincidence, Mr. Knight.

06:45.447 --> 06:47.949
My father sang that very song
at my aunt's wedding.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.118
Everybody loved it.
They made him sing it twice."

06:50.201 --> 06:53.538
Fine. If his dead assistant's favorite
song was "As Long as I'm Singing",

06:53.622 --> 06:55.582
I will tell him
how at Aunt Angie's wedding,

06:55.707 --> 06:57.876
-you were asked to sing it twice.
-Thank you.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.085
Was that so hard?

07:01.087 --> 07:03.590
<i>Would you like to see me</i>
<i>pull a rabbit out of here?</i>

07:03.715 --> 07:05.592
<i>-Sure.</i>
<i>-So would I.</i>

07:05.675 --> 07:07.677
[audience cheering and applauding]

07:18.980 --> 07:22.192
Where's his other Emmy Award?
His talk show wins almost every year.

07:22.859 --> 07:26.196
[Cora] Look who did his homework.
Maybe he gave it to his mother.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.322
A lot of winners do that.

07:28.281 --> 07:31.451
Or maybe it's the murder weapon,
and he had to get rid of it.

07:31.534 --> 07:34.788
Actually, when I bludgeon people,
I prefer to use my Golden Globe.

07:34.913 --> 07:35.914
It's a little bit heavier.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.334
I'm afraid that the real story

07:39.417 --> 07:41.127
is not half as interesting.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.965
-I gave one of them to charity.
-Mr. Knight, thank you for making time.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.800
I'm Lt. Caruso, All-City Homicide.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.301
-This is Detective Vasquez.
-Hello.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.179
Hi. Hello.

07:51.888 --> 07:55.183
I can't believe I'm shaking the hand
that wrote <i>The Little Dipper.</i>

07:55.475 --> 07:58.144
Don't get too excited.
It's done other things too.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.313
[Cora laughs hysterically]

08:00.981 --> 08:02.148
That's good.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.694
How long had Miss Landau worked for you?

08:05.777 --> 08:07.237
Almost three years.

08:07.612 --> 08:11.366
It's just heartbreaking.
I don't know if I'll ever get over it.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.327
-Would you like to have a seat?
-Thank you.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.329
-We just have a few questions.
-Sure.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.549
So, Tuesday night,
you contacted Miss Landau?

08:27.632 --> 08:30.260
That's right.
She had some notes that I needed.

08:30.343 --> 08:34.139
So, I texted her at 9:30,
and asked her to bring them over,

08:34.222 --> 08:35.181
but she never showed.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.976
-Did you call her?
-I did. Two or three times.

08:38.309 --> 08:41.104
-Yeah, you can check my phone records.
-We intend to.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.482
That's the third degree.
I know what that's all about.

08:44.566 --> 08:48.236
That's like... okay.
I did it, you caught me, bro.

08:48.319 --> 08:51.281
I killed that bitch. She had $12
in her purse. I wanted that money.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.491
Shoot that fix,
that $12 right up this arm.

08:53.575 --> 08:54.951
[Cora chuckles]

08:55.035 --> 08:56.411
Are those scratch marks?

08:58.163 --> 08:59.122
That? Yeah.

08:59.497 --> 09:03.501
My girlfriend has a cat, Muckles.
He assaulted me a week ago.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.212
-Can you arrest him?
-One case at a time.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.298
[laughs and sniffs]

09:11.092 --> 09:14.137
So, Tuesday you needed your notes.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.889
-Were they important?
-They were.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.601
She was doing some research for me,
because I've been writing my memoirs

09:20.226 --> 09:23.146
and I'd just finished my first draft.
It's very good.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.689
Would you like to read it?

09:25.190 --> 09:27.150
-I'd be honored.
-Great!

09:27.233 --> 09:28.693
I'm gonna get it. It's upstairs.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.236
-You stay right there.
-Okay.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.033
-You're not helping.
-What?

09:35.742 --> 09:38.203
-The laughing.
-I can't help it. He's funny.

09:38.953 --> 09:41.790
You know he's got a staff full of writers.
Anybody can be funny

09:41.873 --> 09:43.750
-with a staff full of writers.
-Even you?

09:43.833 --> 09:45.835
Excuse me, would you like something
from the kitchen?

09:45.919 --> 09:47.712
No, ma'am. We're fine.

09:47.837 --> 09:48.755
Thank you, though.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.256
Actually...

09:50.757 --> 09:54.135
-How long have you worked for Mr. Knight?
-I just started. It's my second week.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.303
How's it going?

09:56.012 --> 09:57.263
He spoils me.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.432
My first week here,
he gives me two days off.

09:59.516 --> 10:00.475
Really?

10:00.558 --> 10:02.477
Wednesday and Thursday with pay.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.771
Wednesday and Thursday of last week?

10:04.854 --> 10:07.649
Aha! You know, he does
half the cleaning himself.

10:07.899 --> 10:11.319
When I walked in Friday,
the whole first floor was scrubbed clean.

10:12.487 --> 10:13.947
-No kidding.
-Mm-hmm!

10:19.285 --> 10:20.286
Is this a new rug?

10:20.370 --> 10:22.705
Yes, it is.
He had it put in while I was gone.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.625
Thank you, Mrs. P.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.002
Well, here it is.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.048
-Please love it.
-Okay. I promise.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.342
We just have a few more questions,
Mr. Knight.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.595
-How often was Miss Landau here?
-At the house?

10:38.429 --> 10:40.598
Never.
This would have been her first visit.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.892
And did you leave the house on Tuesday?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.019
No, sir. I was tired of waiting

10:45.186 --> 10:47.438
and I decided just to go to bed.

10:47.856 --> 10:48.690
Alone.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.191
Life in the fast lane.

10:50.942 --> 10:51.901
Excuse me.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.320
Mr. Knight, there's an adjunct detective
to see you.

10:54.946 --> 10:55.947
There's a what?

10:56.239 --> 10:57.073
Oh, no.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.327
Richie Knight, we meet at last.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.830
Tony Caruso. "Big Tony", to my friends.

11:03.913 --> 11:04.873
Caruso?

11:05.373 --> 11:07.876
I know that name.
From <i>The</i><i>Caruso Commission?</i>

11:07.959 --> 11:09.252
You've got a good memory.

11:09.544 --> 11:11.337
Wait, I forgot to wipe my feet.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.929
-Mr. C, can we talk outside?
-No, I'm good here.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.181
Is this your father?

11:22.056 --> 11:23.141
I love this room!

11:23.474 --> 11:25.518
What a ceiling! How's the acoustics?

11:32.358 --> 11:35.195
-I'm confused. Are you together?
-Well, not officially,

11:35.278 --> 11:38.072
but I sometimes help out the kids
in an adjunct capacity.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.157
That's not true.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.909
Nothing he just said is true.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.036
As long as I'm here, here's my audition.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.496
I sent you one last month,
but you must've misplaced it.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.290
-An audition?
-Yeah, for your show.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.666
I'm an entertainer, too.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.668
It's in the blood. You can ask Junior.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.546
At his Aunt Angie's wedding,
200 people.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.131
They wouldn't let me off the stage.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.342
-If I'm lying, I'm dying.
-Okay, we've had enough.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.802
Dad, thank you very much.
Mr. Knight, thank you for your time.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.721
Thank you. Detective. Lieutenant.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.307

-We'll get him.

Mr. C, the party's over.

to talk to me eventually.

12:36.839 --> 12:37.715
Alright.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.677
I'm sorry, I interrupted your thing
with Richie Knight.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.471
It wasn't a thing, Dad.
I was interrogating the man.

12:43.554 --> 12:44.806
He's my primary suspect.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.432
Come on. Are you kidding?

12:46.516 --> 12:48.309
You still like him for this?

12:48.393 --> 12:49.435
He's the guy.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.604
Are you kidding? Richie Knight?

12:51.688 --> 12:53.690
Holy Moses! Was he humping her?

12:54.482 --> 12:57.527
No. We asked around. He's never dated
anybody on his staff.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.737
-Then there's no motive.
-Not yet.

13:00.154 --> 13:03.741
But he had the means and the opportunity.
He's the last person she talked to.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.911
He sent his maid home for two days.
He had scratch marks on his arm.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.121
He bought a new rug.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.581
Dad, you can't just barge in like that,

13:10.665 --> 13:12.709
and audition in the middle
of a murder investigation.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.712
Wait a minute.
Are you upset because I interrupted you

13:15.795 --> 13:19.048
-or because he liked me?
-He didn't like you.

13:19.257 --> 13:20.300
Are you kidding me?

13:20.383 --> 13:21.843
He clapped, he said, "Wow."

13:21.926 --> 13:25.805
He was being polite. It was a pity "wow."
Dad, I love you.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.766
I know you love to sing, you've dreamed
of being famous your whole life.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.603
But, at your age you have to face it.
If you haven't succeeded yet...

I'm holding for Richie Knight.

Never too late for you.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.504
Tomorrow?

13:59.881 --> 14:02.508
[huffs] Yeah, sure. I'll make it work.

14:03.593 --> 14:04.927
Great, great. Yeah.

I am, too. Okay, bye. [laughs]

What were you saying

14:18.107 --> 14:20.151
about not having what it takes?

14:20.860 --> 14:21.944
That's not important.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.696
I'm gonna go inside and rehearse.

By the way...

Well, you know...

Richie, I'm Italian,
so we're born singing.

But I started singing in front of people
in prison.

This is expired.

21:10.686 --> 21:11.520

21:13.481 --> 21:15.232
There's an art to torching a car.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.693
Most people think it's the gas tank,
but it's not.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.070
-It's about the fabric.
-The fabric?

Yeah, the fabric.

Show a little discretion.

Yeah, yeah.

21:37.713 --> 21:38.547
Yeah, see?

21:38.631 --> 21:41.926
You ignite the fabric,

Oh, thanks.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.512
[TJ] Of course he knew!
The car was a Petri dish.

22:26.595 --> 22:28.764
-It was full of evidence.
-Are you sure about that?

22:28.848 --> 22:31.267
-Why else would he burn it?
-Because it was a bit!

22:31.392 --> 22:33.060
He burned his own car!

22:33.143 --> 22:36.188
It's conceptual humor.
We do a lot of that in our show.

22:36.313 --> 22:38.148
Our show? So it's your show now, too?

22:38.232 --> 22:40.317
Yeah. I'm a regular now.
I got a promotion.

22:40.401 --> 22:42.152
He's using you, dad.
Why can't you see that?

22:42.236 --> 22:43.863
-For what?
-To screw with me.

22:43.946 --> 22:46.657
Well, not for nothing, Anthony.
He's doing a pretty good job of it.

-Where are you going?
-I can hear you.

22:48.951 --> 22:51.954
[Tony Sr.] You know,
you're just not being fair to the man.

You're treating him worse than CBS.

-Oh, my God.

There is such a thing as a presumption
of innocence, Anthony.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.968
There's no presumption here.
Richie Knight killed that girl.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.220
He killed her in his house
then dumped her by the river.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.972
Why? Tell me that. What's the motive?

23:10.055 --> 23:12.433
I don't know. I'd know more
if you hadn't burned the evidence.

you gotta ignite the fabric."

at any other suspects?

23:17.479 --> 23:18.564
She had a boyfriend.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.858
Ex-boyfriend, and of course we checked,
he was in LA.

Suicide? Really?

-Did you find a note?
-When do you think she killed herself?

23:27.573 --> 23:29.450
Before or after she climbed
into the garbage bag?

23:30.242 --> 23:31.076
After.

23:32.828 --> 23:33.662
Alright, look.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.789
I see what's going on here.

23:36.206 --> 23:39.460
It's pretty obvious.
You don't want to share me with the world.

23:39.835 --> 23:42.212
No, I get it.
And I love you for it. I do.

23:43.005 --> 23:45.257

Did you just say Greg Kinnear?

24:19.959 --> 24:20.793
The actor?

24:21.585 --> 24:23.837
He's famous, but he's not super famous.

Every day I remember who he is
and say his name.

24:29.009 --> 24:29.843

24:30.970 --> 24:32.930
So I know I don't have Alzheimer's.

There he is.

24:36.600 --> 24:37.434
What's he doing?

24:38.185 --> 24:39.895
It looks like trash day.

There's a dumpster in the back.

-Yeah, he loves them.

25:51.717 --> 25:52.593
It's in his book.

25:52.843 --> 25:54.470
When he was seven, on Halloween,

25:54.553 --> 25:56.597
the house across the street
was giving away Milk Duds.

Look, I like to laugh
as much as the next guy.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.692
Yeah, if the next guy is Kim Jong-Un.

26:09.109 --> 26:10.903
The guy walked two blocks
to drop this off.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.780
There is something
he doesn't want us to find.

was there that night.

26:15.449 --> 26:17.659
Coffee grounds... Peanut brittle.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.244
The guy doesn't recycle.

26:19.453 --> 26:21.663
We should report him
to Professor Ponytail.

That'll teach him.

26:27.711 --> 26:28.962
What are the odds?

33:15.368 --> 33:18.121
She stumbled across some
newspaper article or something...

33:18.330 --> 33:20.332
about my shameful secret past;

33:20.874 --> 33:22.876
the drugs, overdoses...

33:24.711 --> 33:27.255
the two dead kids, losers that they were.

33:28.757 --> 33:30.425
Waste of skin, the both of them.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.679
A story like that is is a career killer.

33:35.305 --> 33:37.265
I mean, I would have lost everything.

33:37.891 --> 33:40.393
And eventually, she would have talked
because she was young,

33:40.477 --> 33:42.646
and that's what young people do.
They talk.

33:45.232 --> 33:46.274
I had no choice.

33:47.442 --> 33:48.360
I had to kill her.

33:51.613 --> 33:53.281
Is that... your theory?

33:54.616 --> 33:55.492
More or less.

33:55.909 --> 33:57.160
Well, you're right.

33:58.870 --> 33:59.996
I did kill her.

34:05.085 --> 34:07.128
Are you peeing in the pool right now?

34:07.796 --> 34:08.630
No!

34:09.381 --> 34:11.383
Are you sure?
Because you're making that face--

34:11.466 --> 34:13.051
I'm not peeing in the pool!

34:13.510 --> 34:14.970
Alright, I believe you.

34:16.137 --> 34:17.305
You're an honest man.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.349
What's that like?

34:20.767 --> 34:23.395
She didn't suffer,
in case you were wondering.

34:24.229 --> 34:25.438
She never saw it coming.

34:26.231 --> 34:27.857
-The Emmy Award.
-Yeah.

34:28.066 --> 34:31.069
In the heat of the moment,
it's the first thing I grabbed for.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.530
But I don't care.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.490
There'll be plenty more awards.

34:38.118 --> 34:40.245
-Why are you--
-Why am I telling you this?

34:40.870 --> 34:41.705
Why not?

34:41.871 --> 34:43.373
It's your word against mine.

34:43.873 --> 34:45.166
And I'm Richie Knight,

34:45.250 --> 34:46.960
the dad from <i>Welcome Home.</i>

34:48.086 --> 34:52.173
And you're a cop whose father I fired
in front of the whole world.

34:52.716 --> 34:56.803
You are a cop with no proof,
and no physical evidence,

34:57.220 --> 34:58.513
and I made sure of that.

34:59.472 --> 35:02.684
There is no way you're gonna be able
to connect me to that body.

35:03.476 --> 35:04.436
Oh, you know what?

35:05.186 --> 35:07.981
I have to go. Robert Downey Jr.
is on the show tonight.

35:08.523 --> 35:11.568
It's going to be a good one.
You might want to dry off.

35:20.994 --> 35:23.038
[Burl]
Just a reminder. I gotta leave at six.

35:23.538 --> 35:24.664
[TJ] You got something to do?

35:25.498 --> 35:26.333
No.

35:26.458 --> 35:27.876
We should search his house.

35:28.209 --> 35:29.919
Sgt. Rudner was there all day.

35:30.211 --> 35:32.213
Came back empty. They got nothing.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.924
-Not a stray hair, a fingerprint.
-[Burl] Have you seen this?

35:35.008 --> 35:38.094
It's part of that environmental initiative
"Let's go paperless".

35:38.678 --> 35:39.846
It's 34 pages long!

35:39.929 --> 35:41.973
I know she was in the house,
I just can't prove it.

35:42.057 --> 35:44.184
They must've printed
10,000 copies of this.

35:44.434 --> 35:47.520
340,000 pages on the benefits
are going paperless.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.357
He bested me. He outsmarted me.
He's going to walk.

35:51.566 --> 35:52.817
[Burl] You want some advice?

35:53.693 --> 35:56.196
There's one thing
every good detective knows.

35:57.614 --> 35:58.531
What's that?

35:59.240 --> 36:01.242
[watch alarm beeps]

36:01.910 --> 36:02.911
It's six o'clock.

36:03.453 --> 36:04.621
I'll tell you tomorrow.

36:04.746 --> 36:06.748
-[policemen chattering]
-[phone ringing]

36:26.768 --> 36:27.686
Burl?

36:30.897 --> 36:32.607
You okay? What are you doing?

36:33.441 --> 36:35.527
I'm just savoring the moment.

36:37.445 --> 36:41.616
[presenter] Live on tape from New York,
it's<i> Knight Time, with Richie Knight!</i>

36:41.700 --> 36:43.201
Tonight, Richie welcomes

36:43.284 --> 36:44.494
Robert Downey Jr.,

36:44.703 --> 36:48.248
with Irv Ferguson,
and the mighty Midtown Quartet.

36:48.581 --> 36:51.209
And now, the last best hope
for mankind,

36:51.292 --> 36:52.419
Richie Knight!

36:52.502 --> 36:54.504
[audience cheering and applauding]

36:57.048 --> 36:58.049
Thank you.

36:59.592 --> 37:00.927
I'm not Richie Knight.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.346
My name is Tony Caruso.

37:04.097 --> 37:07.142
I'm a detective
with All-City Homicide task force.

37:08.518 --> 37:10.895
Mr. Knight can't be here tonight
because he's backstage...

37:10.979 --> 37:12.897
currently being arrested
by other officers...

37:12.981 --> 37:14.983
[audience laugh]

37:15.066 --> 37:17.110
for homicide, and aggravated assault,

37:17.527 --> 37:18.945
and tampering with evidence.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.157
And he threw me in a swimming pool.

37:22.699 --> 37:24.075
[audience laughs]

37:24.159 --> 37:26.453
It was the shallow end,
somebody could have gotten hurt.

37:27.829 --> 37:28.830
This is not a joke.

37:29.372 --> 37:32.292
If it were a joke, it would certainly
be funnier than this.

37:32.459 --> 37:36.296
[audience] Richie! Richie! Richie!

37:37.505 --> 37:39.090
No, I got to say something.

37:39.883 --> 37:42.552
You were really important to me
when I was growing up.

37:43.303 --> 37:44.846
I'm very disappointed in you.

37:45.597 --> 37:46.556
I don't care.

37:46.890 --> 37:48.558
-Well, you should.
-Well, I don't.

37:48.933 --> 37:49.893
Well, you should.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.438
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.857
You just made the biggest mistake
of your life.

37:56.733 --> 38:00.153
But I know what this is all about.
This is about a neurotic,

38:00.320 --> 38:02.989
self-hating Lieutenant, who envies me...

38:03.490 --> 38:04.699
and covets my life.

38:04.783 --> 38:05.784
This isn't about me.

38:06.201 --> 38:08.036
It's about justice for Beth Landau.

38:08.661 --> 38:11.623
You know, it just occurred to me.
I've never heard you say her name.

38:11.873 --> 38:13.958
[TJ] More importantly, this is about
your garbage bag.

38:14.042 --> 38:15.502
The one you threw away
on Thursday.

38:16.085 --> 38:17.629
There's no question it was your bag.

38:18.046 --> 38:20.632
These are your bills, your junk mail.
Fingerprints were all over it.

38:20.715 --> 38:22.258
Wow. You caught me.

38:23.092 --> 38:24.844
I disposed of some garbage.

38:25.595 --> 38:26.429
Tell me.

38:26.638 --> 38:29.015
Was there anything in that bag,
anything at all

38:29.098 --> 38:31.100
that connects me to Beth Landau?

38:31.392 --> 38:32.352
No, sir.

38:32.435 --> 38:34.354
Then what the hell are we doing here?

38:34.813 --> 38:36.898
[Cora] Richie, look at me. Hi.

38:37.232 --> 38:39.943
These are Burly 42-gallon contractor bags.

38:40.026 --> 38:41.736
The same brand your trash was in.

38:42.195 --> 38:44.197
Last night, Sgt. Loomis had an idea.

38:44.572 --> 38:45.406
Hello.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.368
I'm a big fan.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.620
Except for butchering that kid.

38:50.703 --> 38:51.746
[TJ] You know, it's true.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.498
There was nothing incriminating
in the bag.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.458
But it occurred to Sgt. Loomis,

38:55.917 --> 38:58.127
maybe we could connect
the trash bag itself,

38:58.211 --> 38:59.671
the one that was found at your house,

38:59.754 --> 39:02.799
with the other trash bag,
the trash bag that the killer used.

39:02.966 --> 39:04.509
It was the exact same brand.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.135
Burly 42-gallon.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.012
So what?

39:08.096 --> 39:09.973
They must sell a million of those a year.

39:10.306 --> 39:12.809
-Thirty-five million, actually.
-Here's where it gets interesting.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.228
The two bags,
yours and the one the killer used,

39:15.520 --> 39:16.980
they came from the same roll.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.566
-The same roll?
-Sgt. Loomis?

39:19.816 --> 39:21.234
Introduce him to your friend.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.570
[Burl] This is Alvin Roundie.

39:23.778 --> 39:26.364
He's a distinguished professor
of Environmental Studies

39:26.447 --> 39:27.615
at Columbia University.

39:27.699 --> 39:28.658
-Hi.
-Hello.

39:28.741 --> 39:31.369
This is how trash bags are manufactured.

39:31.744 --> 39:33.288
[factory machinery working]

39:34.247 --> 39:36.332
I can't believe I'm watching this again.

39:36.416 --> 39:39.210
And when the oil is added
it creates dozens of rivulets.

39:39.294 --> 39:40.962
So no two sheets are alike.

39:41.045 --> 39:43.214
So two bags from the same roll...

39:43.715 --> 39:44.841
would match up perfectly.

39:44.924 --> 39:46.259
Like a jigsaw puzzle.

39:46.593 --> 39:47.468
Or a fingerprint.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.888
We checked this morning and bingo.

39:50.096 --> 39:50.930
Mr. Knight

39:52.223 --> 39:54.726
can you explain
how the body of Elizabeth Landau

39:55.059 --> 39:57.312
was found in a bag
that came from your house?

40:08.907 --> 40:09.824
Richie...

40:10.825 --> 40:12.368
What should we do with the audience?

40:15.413 --> 40:16.581
Just send them home.

40:19.459 --> 40:21.461
Okay. [speaks on radio]

40:33.765 --> 40:35.558
-[Cora sighs]
-I don't like it.

40:36.935 --> 40:37.769
