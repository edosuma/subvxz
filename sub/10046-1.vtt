00:01.302 --> 00:02.203
(brass music)

00:02.235 --> 00:03.037
(pig grunts briefly)

00:13.481 --> 00:14.315
(pig grunts)

00:14.348 --> 00:18.086
(suspenseful music)

00:34.202 --> 00:37.805
(more electronic
suspenseful music)

00:45.813 --> 00:49.483
(wind blowing)

02:22.243 --> 02:26.614
(lightly chiming,
suspenseful music)

02:36.824 --> 02:38.492
(spoon clinks)

02:40.361 --> 02:43.597
(more ominous music)

02:43.631 --> 02:48.269
(low whooshing sound)

03:01.782 --> 03:04.852
(suspenseful music grows louder)

03:08.556 --> 03:13.294
(faint overlapping,
whispering voices)

03:21.935 --> 03:23.304
(doorbell rings, with knocking)

03:24.372 --> 03:26.974
(insistent doorbell-ringing
and knocking)

03:28.342 --> 03:31.612
(whooshing noise)

03:33.581 --> 03:34.848
(knocking)

03:36.950 --> 03:38.352
(louder knocking)

03:39.820 --> 03:41.389
(knocking)

03:43.357 --> 03:48.296
(persistent knocking)

03:48.829 --> 03:50.464
- Hello.
- You called for a distiller?

03:50.498 --> 03:52.600
- Yes, come in.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.935
I spoke with a
man on the phone--

03:54.968 --> 03:56.437
- Moses.
- Yes, Moses.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.872
He said 9:00. I
assumed he meant p.m.

03:59.607 --> 04:02.743
P.m. is prime time.
I've missed my stories.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.312
- Well, I guess I thought
since they come out

04:04.345 --> 04:05.813
at night, that that would mean--

04:05.846 --> 04:07.915
- No, they come out all the
time, we just notice them

04:07.948 --> 04:10.484
more at night because you don't
have anything better to do.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.921
And your name is?

04:14.355 --> 04:15.789
- My name is Matthew Moon.

04:16.790 --> 04:17.891
Has it been happening
all over the house?

04:17.925 --> 04:19.860
- Mostly in the study, although
we've been hearing them

04:19.892 --> 04:21.428
in other places as well.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.864
- Just hearing? You
haven't seen anything?

04:23.897 --> 04:25.065
- We've had several
items go missing.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.468
We thought someone had
been stealing from us.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.804
- What about
batteries going dead

04:30.838 --> 04:32.039
before they're supposed to?

04:32.072 --> 04:34.642
What about food expiring
before it's supposed to?

04:35.509 --> 04:36.844
- Now that you mention it,

04:36.877 --> 04:38.379
we've been having trouble
keeping milk fresh without--

04:38.412 --> 04:40.814
- Milk! Shit.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.049
You didn't drink
any of it, did you?

04:42.082 --> 04:43.917
- No, should I have?

04:45.919 --> 04:47.821
- It's just that milk
makes them strong,

04:47.855 --> 04:49.490
makes them excitable.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.859
It does more than
just a body good.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.929
Did you get the items
Moses asked you to get?

04:55.963 --> 04:57.898
- Yes. Yes, I picked
them up last night.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.533
Let me go and get them for you.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.338
(distantly) I have been
finding crumbs everywhere.

05:04.372 --> 05:06.006
Could that mean anything?

05:06.039 --> 05:07.341
(hits piano key)

05:15.883 --> 05:18.386
- This is bad place
to put cookies.

05:20.854 --> 05:25.025
(lighthearted horns music)

05:27.561 --> 05:29.930
Hm. This is too
cheap, it won't work.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.533
- Moses just said rum, he
didn't say expensive rum.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.568
- He didn't say
cheap rum either.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.371
Where's your liquor cabinet?

05:37.405 --> 05:38.138
- [Man] It's to the left.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.440
- No. No.

05:39.473 --> 05:40.874
- No, farther left.

05:42.976 --> 05:43.877
- Aha.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.615
- That was a gift!

05:47.648 --> 05:49.617
Are you sure none of these
other bottles will do?

05:49.650 --> 05:51.485
How do they even
know the difference?

05:51.519 --> 05:52.553
- You said the
reading room, right?

05:52.586 --> 05:53.887
- Yes!

05:53.921 --> 05:56.924
(footsteps across
creaking floorboards)

05:57.925 --> 06:01.795
(light, suspenseful music)

06:12.506 --> 06:13.874
(sighs)

06:17.911 --> 06:22.850
(ominous music)

06:37.030 --> 06:41.602
(low whooshing noise)

06:51.011 --> 06:52.613
- They like sweets.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.172
(uncorks bottle)

07:19.807 --> 07:21.174
(sniffs)

07:22.543 --> 07:23.577
Can you hear that?

07:23.611 --> 07:27.581
(overlapping, whispering voices)

07:29.517 --> 07:31.619
They can smell the bourbon.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.593
Ok, now I need your blood.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.829
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:41.862 --> 07:45.032
Why can't we use your blood?

07:45.065 --> 07:47.067
- Well, that'll cost you extra.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.937
A lot extra.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.974
- (sighs)

07:56.977 --> 07:58.612
A Swiss Army knife?

07:58.646 --> 08:00.180
Shouldn't it be a magic knife,

08:00.213 --> 08:02.082
with a dragon skull
carved into it,

08:02.115 --> 08:04.117
or some other iconography?

08:04.985 --> 08:07.087
- This knife has a can
opener, a screwdriver,

08:07.120 --> 08:08.822
and performs ritual
bloodletting.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.090
It also has a toothpick.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.159
That sounds pretty
magical to me.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.994
- I can draw my own blood.

08:16.096 --> 08:19.199
(suspenseful music builds)

08:19.232 --> 08:20.868
(liquid sloshes)

08:21.969 --> 08:23.003
(sighs)

08:24.872 --> 08:27.608
(inhales, grunts)

08:39.219 --> 08:43.557
(blows across bottle)

08:44.091 --> 08:48.662
(wind whooshes)
(blows across bottle)

08:49.663 --> 08:52.265
(wind howls)

08:52.900 --> 08:56.069
(blows across bottle)

08:57.671 --> 09:00.841
(blows across bottle)

09:02.910 --> 09:06.079
(blows across bottle)

09:06.880 --> 09:09.249
(wind whooshes)

09:09.282 --> 09:13.320
(wind grows to a roar)

09:13.353 --> 09:16.857
(blows on bottle)
(roar fades)

09:18.258 --> 09:22.062
(blows on bottle)

09:24.932 --> 09:28.802
(blows on bottle)

09:28.836 --> 09:30.370
(blows on bottle)

09:30.403 --> 09:32.940
(wind whooshes)

09:32.973 --> 09:35.809
(continues to blow on bottle)

09:35.843 --> 09:40.648
(wind roars)

09:46.954 --> 09:47.821
(coughs)

09:47.855 --> 09:49.389
- (coughs)

09:49.422 --> 09:51.892
- (inhales, clears throat)

09:51.925 --> 09:52.860
(bottle sloshes)

09:56.897 --> 09:58.031
(clears throat)

10:02.069 --> 10:03.170
(bottle sloshes)

10:03.203 --> 10:05.305
(coughs, clears throat)

10:05.973 --> 10:08.942
- Here. It dissipates
with time, but trust me--

10:08.976 --> 10:10.944
- (shuddering noise)
- it's in there.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.980
And whatever you do,
don't ever open it.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.682
Unless you want to cause
some trouble again.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.950
And don't ever drink it.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.085
(bottle sloshes)

10:18.118 --> 10:19.953
- You, you're not
taking it with you.

10:19.987 --> 10:22.856
- No, it's yours, for you
to display as you please.

10:22.890 --> 10:23.791
- No. No, no, no, no.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.292
My cleaning woman is
extremely superstitious.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.094
She would never allow
this to be in our home.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.328
She would quit cleaning,
the whole place would--

10:28.361 --> 10:29.863
- If you want me to take it--

10:29.897 --> 10:30.764
- My wife would never allow it.

10:30.798 --> 10:31.965
- It's going to cost you more.

10:31.999 --> 10:32.966
- Fine. Fine. Take it with you.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.968
Whatever it costs, just
get it out of my house.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.236
- Fine.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.109
- What the hell was that anyway?

10:43.010 --> 10:45.946
- Oh, it'll be
itemized on your bill.

10:50.918 --> 10:55.756
(tropical music)
(airplane zooming)

11:08.035 --> 11:10.003
- Hi.
- [Woman over phone] Matt?

11:10.037 --> 11:11.371
- Yeah, I just flew in.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.140
- [Woman] We just got your
package for Blue in the mail.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.908
I'll put her on
after she opens it.

11:14.942 --> 11:18.211
- Yeah, sure. How's
the birthday girl?

11:18.245 --> 11:19.880
- [Woman] She's been
asking about you.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.348
We got your postcard
from Santa Fe.

11:21.381 --> 11:24.151
They thought you said
you saw Santa Claus.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.119
How's the weather?

11:26.153 --> 11:28.455
- [Matt] Oh, the weather's
fine. It's hot as always.

11:28.488 --> 11:29.923
- [Woman] They were
predicting rain

11:29.957 --> 11:31.291
- [Girl] Yay!
- [Woman] for us today,

11:31.324 --> 11:32.425
but it turned out to be
nice for her party later.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.895
- [Matt] Great. That's great.

11:34.928 --> 11:35.896
How's the fish?

11:35.929 --> 11:37.264
- [Woman] It's really big.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.899
It was a nice thought, but

11:38.932 --> 11:42.469
Charlie would rather
watch TV or play games.

11:42.502 --> 11:45.973
I think he's going to be
more of an indoor kid.

11:46.173 --> 11:47.174
- [Girl] Yay!

11:47.207 --> 11:48.275
- [Woman] Blue ...

11:50.010 --> 11:52.045
- [Blue] No!
- [Charlie] (giggles)

11:52.079 --> 11:53.180
(both giggle, chatter)

11:53.213 --> 11:55.215
- [Woman] Blue, Uncle
Matt's on the phone.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.051
- Hi Uncle Matt.
- [Woman] say thank you

11:58.085 --> 12:00.253
for the teddy bear.
- Hi Blue, happy birthday.

12:00.287 --> 12:03.190
Did you get the box of
styrofoam peanuts I sent you?

12:03.223 --> 12:04.892
- [Blue] (giggles)
- [Woman] Say thank you!

12:04.925 --> 12:08.095
- Thank you for the teddy
bear. I really love it.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.932
- Oh, was there one of
those in the box too? Good.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.500
- [Woman] Give me the phone.
- [Blue] Bye!

12:15.235 --> 12:17.037
- Hey Matt.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.373
Charlie! Matt, I gotta go.

12:21.008 --> 12:24.011
Charlie, what are
you doing? (sighs)

12:26.046 --> 12:28.481
(ominous music)

12:28.515 --> 12:30.884
- I mean, we'll probably
have a connecting flight

12:30.918 --> 12:32.085
somewhere in Heathrow.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.987
We should meet up for
dinner or something.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.090
Hi.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.326
- Looks like I'm
late for the party.

12:50.137 --> 12:53.974
Sorry I'm late. Family
business to attend to.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.943
Apparently they're
not taking Visa

12:55.976 --> 12:58.211
in Saudi Arabia these days.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.982
- Another client declined
to keep their souvenir

13:02.015 --> 13:04.017
from the experience, I take it.

13:04.051 --> 13:06.419
- Either we're not charging
enough for its storage

13:06.453 --> 13:09.222
or people just aren't as
sentimental as they used to be.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.358
- Only you would
be morbid enough

13:11.391 --> 13:13.994
to keep these things
as decorations.

13:14.027 --> 13:18.131
Besides, storage is our
most profitable service.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.200
- This one caused
me enough trouble

13:20.233 --> 13:21.969
that I'd like to hang onto it.

13:23.070 --> 13:25.873
(ominous music)

13:25.906 --> 13:27.474
- Have it sent
back with Fussell.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.876
- [Man] Your trophy collection

13:28.909 --> 13:30.277
is more trouble than it's worth.

13:30.310 --> 13:34.915
- Better that they be kept
safe in my disused house

13:34.948 --> 13:37.384
than in some storage
facility where a

13:37.417 --> 13:39.419
hapless maintenance
worker can come along

13:39.452 --> 13:41.121
and have the drink of his life.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.290
- And yet you take your
caretaker to put them away,

13:43.323 --> 13:46.226
despite the fact that you
won't tell him what's inside.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.095
(bottle clanking)

13:49.029 --> 13:51.131
I hate it when they look at me.

13:51.531 --> 13:55.335
- Where's Baynes?
Baynes run into trouble?

13:56.069 --> 13:59.306
- (sighs) No. Trouble ate him.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.441
Most of him, at least.
We found the body.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.443
We're shipping him
back to Akron tomorrow.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.946
- Moses, that'll cost
an arm and a leg.

14:05.979 --> 14:06.813
- You're awful.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.282
- I mean, it's expensive
to ship a body.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.985
Especially if there's so
little of him left to ship.

14:12.019 --> 14:16.924
- And I mean it, you're
an awful, cheap bastard.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.058
(bottle rattling)
You wouldn't want to be sent

14:18.091 --> 14:19.459
back to your family?

14:19.492 --> 14:21.929
- For God's sake Moses, when
I die, go ahead, cremate me.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.031
Send me home in an envelope, ok?

14:24.064 --> 14:26.366
- (scoffs) I suppose we
just tell the postman

14:26.399 --> 14:27.968
it's a package of coffee?

14:29.002 --> 14:30.337
- Pepper. I hate coffee.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.973
(bottle rattles)
- (sighs)

14:33.006 --> 14:34.307
(distant laugh)

14:34.341 --> 14:39.079
(ominous music, distant voices)

14:43.250 --> 14:45.218
We recovered this
with Baines' body.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.120
You'll need it for the ritual.

14:49.556 --> 14:53.426
- (coughs)

14:53.460 --> 14:56.229
- You're not sounding very
good. You feel all right?

14:56.263 --> 14:59.232
- (coughs, laughing)
No worse than you look.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.935
(coughs)

15:01.969 --> 15:05.973
- Yes, but I look a
little worse every year.

15:06.006 --> 15:08.208
- (coughs)

15:08.241 --> 15:10.477
- Maybe you should
take some time,

15:10.510 --> 15:12.379
go visit your girlfriend,
what's her name, Blue?

15:12.412 --> 15:14.547
- Blue's my niece, Moses.

15:16.216 --> 15:19.086
- Spend some money
for once. Take time.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.189
You know better than most
you can't take it with you.

15:23.356 --> 15:26.126
- I'll take time when
the holidays come.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.962
- You don't look like
you'd last another week,

15:28.996 --> 15:31.031
let alone five months.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.434
- The holidays.

15:35.735 --> 15:38.738
Now if you'll excuse me,
your time is my money.

15:38.771 --> 15:42.109
- Don't forget to
wear something warm.

15:42.142 --> 15:47.047
(dramatic music)

15:59.459 --> 16:03.530
(wind blowing)

16:11.771 --> 16:16.243
(crunches across snow)

16:19.212 --> 16:21.248
(fabric rustles)

16:24.184 --> 16:26.786
- (sighs) Well,
there's your problem.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.189
He probably wanted
it back in his cave.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.359
Or wherever you stole it from.

16:32.392 --> 16:37.230
(crunching snow, growling)

16:40.333 --> 16:44.737
- (grunts)
(growls)

16:44.771 --> 16:47.107
- You're no humble Bumble.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.077
(grunts)

16:52.345 --> 16:54.214
(roars)

16:55.582 --> 17:00.587
(grunts) This is for you.
(roars)

17:02.789 --> 17:04.691
- (spits out cork)
(roars)

17:04.723 --> 17:08.728
(blows across bottle)
(wind howls)

17:08.761 --> 17:12.499
(blows across bottle)
(wind continues to blow)

17:12.531 --> 17:14.501
(blows across bottle)

17:16.769 --> 17:18.738
(radio channels quickly switch)

17:18.771 --> 17:20.839
(quirky music)

17:20.873 --> 17:23.143
- Stop touching the radio.
(clicks off)

17:23.810 --> 17:26.179
When you drive, you'll get
to pick what we listen to.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.248
- When I drive, we get to
listen to listen to you

17:28.281 --> 17:29.816
running your mouth,
which pretty much

17:29.849 --> 17:32.085
drowns everything else out.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.720
- I'm sure you'll
really miss hearing

17:33.753 --> 17:35.855
one of the 20 classic rock
songs they play in a loop

17:35.888 --> 17:37.824
because you really
needed to hear "Stairway"

17:37.857 --> 17:39.492
just one more time.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.328
- You know what, if
someone didn't forget

17:41.361 --> 17:43.496
which bag she packed
the iPod in ...

17:43.530 --> 17:45.732
- You know, it's too bad
you feel like tuning me out,

17:45.765 --> 17:47.134
instead of speaking with me.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.301
You won't be seeing
as much of me,

17:48.335 --> 17:50.337
now that's I've
got my own place.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.406
- Would you stop
shoving that in my face?

17:53.440 --> 17:54.807
You know, you'd still
be living at home too,

17:54.841 --> 17:57.410
if Uncle Matt left me the house.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.811
- Jealous?

17:58.845 --> 18:00.680
- Yeah. How could I not be?

18:00.713 --> 18:03.516
Twenty years of wondering
what the hell happened to him,

18:03.550 --> 18:05.752
and the last message
I get is a box

18:05.785 --> 18:08.188
of reruns of "ALF" on VHS?

18:08.221 --> 18:10.823
- (laughs) You loved "ALF."

18:10.857 --> 18:13.260
You loved it so much.

18:13.826 --> 18:17.264
- And you got a house. I
mean, how fair is that?

18:17.297 --> 18:19.432
- You watched those shows
with him when we'd visit.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.234
It's a sentimental gift.

18:22.569 --> 18:25.838
- (sighs) I mean, who
even has a VCR anymore?

18:25.872 --> 18:28.441
The only place we'll be able
to watch them is at your house.

18:28.475 --> 18:29.742
Your house.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.744
Maybe I'll spend the
weekend reminiscing

18:31.778 --> 18:33.480
about my '80s childhood.

18:33.513 --> 18:36.849
And you get to clean up 20
years of disrepair and junk.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.751
- You know, it's so cute
when you get all sulky.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.354
That's how I know
you'll really miss me.

18:41.388 --> 18:44.491
(up-tempo instrumental music)

18:55.535 --> 18:56.803
- What time are we
supposed to meet,

18:56.836 --> 18:58.905
uh, what's-his-face,
the caretaker?

18:58.938 --> 19:01.808
- Mr. Fussell? We're early,
still got, like, half an hour.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.812
(bell tolls)

19:06.746 --> 19:09.416
I can't believe it's been 20
years since he disappeared.

19:09.449 --> 19:12.919
- Yeah, well, he was almost
always away on business anyway.

19:13.453 --> 19:16.489
He hardly ever came home,
except for on holidays.

19:16.523 --> 19:17.790
That's why it took
people so long

19:17.824 --> 19:19.859
to even file a missing
person's report.

19:19.892 --> 19:22.929
He was always just,
out there somewhere.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.264
(bell tolls)

19:24.297 --> 19:26.233
- (chuckles) Missing
episodes of "ALF."

19:26.266 --> 19:28.801
- Yeah, that's why he taped 'em.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.370
- Nowadays, I suppose
he could have just

19:30.403 --> 19:32.839
watched them on his phone,
wherever he was working.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.508
- That's true, and
there'd be no commercials.

19:35.542 --> 19:36.909
- Old commercials are fun!

19:36.943 --> 19:38.778
That's the best
part of old tapes!

19:38.811 --> 19:39.912
(bell tolls)

19:39.946 --> 19:41.448
- There's plenty of
ads on the Internet.

19:41.481 --> 19:44.317
- Sure, and in the future,
when they implant Wi-Fi

19:44.351 --> 19:46.886
in your brain, you won't
need memories anymore either.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.187
- Ha ha.

19:49.422 --> 19:54.261
(mysterious music)

20:43.009 --> 20:47.614
(dog barks)

20:55.422 --> 20:57.457
- Here's a set of keys for you.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.392
You should find most
things in decent order.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.827
- Most things.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.395
(dog barking)

21:02.429 --> 21:02.995
- [Mr. Fussell] It's dusty
and there's mail everywhere.

21:03.029 --> 21:04.564
I ran out of places.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.599
I don't know where to put
everything after 20 years.

21:06.633 --> 21:07.867
(dog barking)
- Well, it'll be nice

21:07.900 --> 21:08.935
to have someone in
the old house again.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.003
And Mr. Fussell won't
have any excuses

21:11.037 --> 21:12.839
to not help out and leave me.

21:13.906 --> 21:17.043
- I was up there yesterday
and turned on the gas.

21:17.076 --> 21:19.446
The wiring is old up there,

21:19.479 --> 21:22.915
and don't be surprised if
the electricity goes out.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.485
You should check the hot
tub before you turn it on.

21:25.518 --> 21:26.886
(dog barking)
- The hot tub!

21:26.919 --> 21:28.888
I totally forgot
he had one. Sweet!

21:28.921 --> 21:29.822
(dog barking)

21:29.856 --> 21:31.023
- [Mr. Fussell] And be careful.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.392
I set up mice traps
down in the basement.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.960
The roof's still
in good condition.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.562
(dog barking)
- So's the television.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.797
Mr. Fussell leaves me alone
often enough to check on that.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.399
- Grace, go see what
Toby's barking about.

21:39.432 --> 21:42.802
(mysterious music)
(Toby barking)

21:42.835 --> 21:45.538
- If you need any help--
- You can call a handyman.

21:45.572 --> 21:46.873
He's done more
than his fair share

21:46.906 --> 21:48.441
of helping out around here.
- Enough.

21:48.475 --> 21:50.810
If Toby hops the fence,
you can go after him.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.078
It's your turn.

21:53.079 --> 21:57.550
(mysterious music)

22:00.420 --> 22:04.557
(birds caw)

22:23.910 --> 22:28.581
(door creaks open)
(noise like wind)

22:39.859 --> 22:43.863
(mysterious music
adds dramatic piano)

22:52.939 --> 22:54.841
- Hey cool, Uncle Matt's hat!

22:54.874 --> 22:55.975
- What?

22:58.010 --> 23:00.046
What are you doing?

23:03.516 --> 23:05.117
Would you give me that!

23:07.019 --> 23:08.888
(coughs)

23:11.157 --> 23:13.926
You have to lean into it ...

23:15.027 --> 23:16.629
like you mean it.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.467
You want to try again?

23:39.185 --> 23:40.920
Whoa.

23:41.187 --> 23:42.889
Guess dear old Mrs. Fussell

23:42.922 --> 23:44.991
wasn't the only thing
being neglected, huh?

23:45.024 --> 23:46.559
- (chuckles wryly)

23:48.995 --> 23:51.898
- Looks like the TV's
pretty well taken care of,

23:52.565 --> 23:54.000
and the snacks.

23:55.067 --> 23:57.036
(sniffs) Let's hope
for that old guy's sake

23:57.069 --> 23:59.205
that, uh, those
aren't 20 years old.

24:01.941 --> 24:02.909
Whoa!

24:02.942 --> 24:03.910
- What?

24:03.943 --> 24:04.911
- Nuthin', just--

24:04.944 --> 24:05.845
- A mouse?

24:05.878 --> 24:06.946
- Nope, not a mouse.

24:06.979 --> 24:07.880
- Mr. Fussell--
- I'll take care of it.

24:07.914 --> 24:09.048
- was talking about a mouse.

24:09.081 --> 24:11.217
(dramatic strings music)
- I'm aware.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.953
(rustling around)

24:16.088 --> 24:17.223
- What?

24:17.256 --> 24:18.858
- There's a mouse
down there. it's dead!

24:18.891 --> 24:19.959
- I'm not touching it.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.594
- I'll take care of it.
- Yeah.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.531
That's what you're here for.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.866
- Great.
- (shakes package)

24:27.967 --> 24:29.201
Lucky me.

24:29.235 --> 24:32.138
(water whooshes)
- Water works.

24:32.171 --> 24:34.874
- Hm. Wonder who's
been paying for it?

24:35.975 --> 24:38.177
Look at these bills.
Second notice.

24:38.210 --> 24:42.081
Third notice.
Second final notice.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.650
Absolutely fin--

24:44.951 --> 24:46.919
I mean, do they even
do that anymore?

24:46.953 --> 24:48.287
- I think it's an old thing.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.657
- Yeah, probably before they
had collections agencies.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.825
Probably pretty
hard to repo water.

24:52.859 --> 24:56.929
(dramatic music)

24:57.997 --> 25:01.300
Ugh. Did you know that
coffee can grow mold?

25:01.333 --> 25:04.170
Who knew? That's terrible.

25:04.203 --> 25:07.273
- Mmm. And you can
clean that too.

25:07.306 --> 25:08.875
- Thanks.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.989
Hope this isn't a support web.

25:25.157 --> 25:29.996
(dramatic music deepens)

25:32.865 --> 25:35.167
(items clatter)

25:37.904 --> 25:42.541
(chair creaks)
Chair still works.

25:53.185 --> 25:55.187
- Blue Bear!

26:02.895 --> 26:05.031
- Aw, look who you found.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.800
- It's like no time
has passed at all,

26:07.834 --> 26:09.602
from when we used to
stay here as kids.

26:09.636 --> 26:10.937
- Yeah, you're right.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.171
I mean, with no one
here to pass the time,

26:12.204 --> 26:14.941
I guess time didn't even pass.

26:15.174 --> 26:16.843
So I guess you can
take the bottom bunk,

26:16.876 --> 26:19.311
and I'm gonna take the
master bedroom upstairs.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.014
That was Uncle Matt's.

26:22.982 --> 26:24.884
I think we should
leave it alone,

26:24.917 --> 26:26.318
at least for the time being.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.955
- (sighs) Ok, fine.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.322
Can I at least take
the room next door?

26:30.356 --> 26:32.091
Is that off-limits?

26:33.960 --> 26:35.027
- It's yours.

26:35.061 --> 26:36.162
- I just think I'm
a little too old

26:36.195 --> 26:38.064
to be sharing a bunk
bed with my sister.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.899
- Fine, it's yours.

26:39.932 --> 26:44.003
(almost military marching music)

27:39.926 --> 27:44.130
(upbeat, whimsical music)

29:52.058 --> 29:53.893
(door creaks)

29:58.931 --> 30:00.967
- Oh, do you remember this?

30:04.236 --> 30:05.872
- Hey, you want to go
down to the pond with me,

30:05.905 --> 30:07.273
see if we can catch anything?

30:07.306 --> 30:08.474
- (sighs) You know that there

30:08.507 --> 30:11.110
are never any fish
in there, right?

30:12.111 --> 30:15.147
Mom and Dad just sent us down
there to, uh, waste some time?

30:15.181 --> 30:16.182
- Ugh.

30:19.518 --> 30:22.955
(ominous music)
(door creaking)

30:24.523 --> 30:25.892
Why wouldn't they have
put a light switch

30:25.925 --> 30:27.927
at the top of the stairs?

30:29.328 --> 30:31.497
This basement always
gave me the creeps.

30:31.530 --> 30:35.367
- Oooooh, Charlie, it's
the furnace talking.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.438
(screams)

30:39.471 --> 30:41.073
- Found it.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.311
You ok?
- (sighs)

30:45.344 --> 30:48.114
- Come on.
- (sighs)

30:48.147 --> 30:49.982
- The pinball machine!
- (sighs)

30:55.087 --> 30:57.023
- Wonder if it still works.

30:58.991 --> 31:02.128
Think it saved my high score?
(machine whirs, clanks)

31:06.032 --> 31:08.467
(powering-down noise)

31:08.500 --> 31:10.970
- (laughs) Amazing
that it saved that

31:11.003 --> 31:12.371
after all these years.

31:20.412 --> 31:23.515
(taps, makes whimsical
shooting sound)

31:28.154 --> 31:31.490
(music grows more ominous)

31:33.960 --> 31:35.061
Hm.

31:35.561 --> 31:36.295
Ugh.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.238
(hums)

31:52.244 --> 31:55.414
(uncorks bottle)
(discordant piano in music)

32:06.425 --> 32:08.961
- Oh man, this is awesome.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.564
You gotta come ...

32:13.399 --> 32:14.700
Hey, what is that?

32:14.733 --> 32:16.935
- I think it's
supposed to be liquor.

32:22.408 --> 32:25.011
- Holy awesome.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.279
Uncle Matt must have been
some kind of bootlegger.

32:27.313 --> 32:29.448
(scoffs, laughing)

32:30.782 --> 32:33.019
(liquid sloshes)
Hey.

32:40.559 --> 32:41.760
Uh, wha--

32:41.793 --> 32:43.295
What?

32:43.529 --> 32:48.067
(stuttering, sighs)
- First one's for Uncle Matt.

32:49.035 --> 32:50.369
There's plenty for
you to get loaded on

32:50.402 --> 32:52.004
at the party tomorrow.

32:52.038 --> 32:53.439
Let's finish up. Come on.

32:53.472 --> 32:57.109
- Damn straight. Whole
basement full of moonshine?

32:57.543 --> 32:59.111
This Fourth of July,
I'm going to celebrate

32:59.145 --> 33:02.014
by becoming independent
from my pants.

33:09.355 --> 33:14.060
(ominous music)

33:27.539 --> 33:31.777
(whimsical music)

33:31.810 --> 33:35.114
(dog barks)

33:35.847 --> 33:38.084
- It was right over there!

33:38.117 --> 33:39.218
It followed me all the way home

33:39.251 --> 33:40.819
and just stood
outside my window,

33:40.852 --> 33:43.489
staring, like it weren't
never gonna stop.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.557
- That was the time
you tried to have sex

33:45.591 --> 33:47.226
in the graveyard, huh?

33:47.259 --> 33:48.760
What happened to the girl?

33:48.794 --> 33:51.097
- Huh. She's all right.

33:51.397 --> 33:54.266
Boy she was pissed!

33:54.300 --> 33:56.368
She heard something but
didn't think it was worth

33:56.402 --> 33:58.804
me jumping up and running away.

33:59.271 --> 34:01.273
- Well, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

34:01.307 --> 34:03.809
but people don't tend to
live long, fruitful lives

34:03.842 --> 34:06.378
once they actually
see a Black Shuck.

34:06.412 --> 34:07.746
- A black--

34:07.779 --> 34:08.847
- [Matt] Shuck.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.549
Matches the description
of what you saw.

34:11.183 --> 34:13.452
In the old days, there
was a superstition,

34:13.485 --> 34:16.788
that the first person
buried in a new cemetery

34:16.822 --> 34:20.426
was given the task of protecting
that cemetery from evil.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.728
But to keep human
souls off guard duty,

34:23.762 --> 34:25.496
churches started a new custom.

34:26.465 --> 34:29.135
In the first grave
of a new cemetery,

34:29.168 --> 34:32.103
they would bury a black dog,

34:32.138 --> 34:34.440
usually a Lab or a Shepherd.

34:34.473 --> 34:37.309
And they would bury
this dog alive.

34:38.277 --> 34:39.745
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's messed up, man.

34:39.777 --> 34:41.480
This thing ain't no dog!

34:41.513 --> 34:44.815
It was big, like a, like a
gator or a coyote or something.

34:44.850 --> 34:47.286
- They get that way after
being dead for a few centuries.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.855
But once you've seen one,
you've only got three days

34:49.888 --> 34:51.123
before you end up buried

34:51.157 --> 34:52.458
in the same cemetery
that it guards.

34:52.491 --> 34:55.261
- Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean, "seen"?

34:55.293 --> 34:58.164
- As in looked at, you
know, with your eyes.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.898
- But I did that!

34:59.931 --> 35:01.200
- And tonight's
your third night,

35:01.233 --> 35:02.801
which is why I'm sure
you'll understand

35:02.834 --> 35:05.737
you need cash up front
if we're to go further.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.843
- [Man] Ohhh, I don't like this.

35:11.877 --> 35:12.778
- [Matt] You don't have to.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.780
- When I hired you,
Moses didn't say nuthin'

35:14.813 --> 35:16.882
about me havin' to play bait.

35:17.549 --> 35:19.418
What are you doing?

35:19.451 --> 35:21.353
- I thought I made that clear.

35:21.387 --> 35:24.790
I can't look in its eyes,
or it'll come after me.

35:25.224 --> 35:26.758
But you've already looked at it,

35:26.792 --> 35:28.494
and you can't die twice.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.397
- What, why can't
you just kill it?

35:33.832 --> 35:35.834
- Because it's already dead.

35:35.867 --> 35:38.370
You did take physics in
high school, didn't you?

35:39.805 --> 35:42.774
Look, just lead it down
the alley, onto the seal,

35:42.808 --> 35:44.910
and I'll take care of the rest.

35:45.944 --> 35:47.179
First--
(bottle sloshes)

35:47.213 --> 35:48.847
you'll need some of this.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.882
- You're damn straight.

35:51.517 --> 35:53.452
- No, actually, not like that.
- Oh.

35:54.386 --> 35:56.255
- He needs to be
able to smell you.

35:58.390 --> 35:59.891
- (groans)

36:01.427 --> 36:04.796
(unearthly howl)
(creepy electronic music)

36:04.830 --> 36:06.865
(whistling)

36:07.333 --> 36:08.800
(whistling)

36:13.505 --> 36:16.208
(whistling)

36:19.311 --> 36:22.548
(whistling)

36:26.885 --> 36:29.288
(whistling)

36:29.821 --> 36:31.790
(whistling)

36:33.359 --> 36:35.427
(whistling)

36:50.476 --> 36:51.410
(ghostly barking)
What?

36:51.443 --> 36:53.479
(barking)

36:58.817 --> 37:00.852
(whistling)

37:02.321 --> 37:06.525
(whistling)
Here boy.

37:06.558 --> 37:09.861
(whistling)
Damn mutt.

37:13.465 --> 37:16.602
Here boy. (whistling)

37:17.603 --> 37:19.838
(car zooms by)
(thumps into woman)

37:19.871 --> 37:21.840
Ugh, nice night for a walk.

37:21.873 --> 37:24.776
- [Woman] Ooh! Least
y'all ain't drivin'!

37:32.884 --> 37:34.586
- Damn mutt.

37:34.620 --> 37:38.857
(ominous music intensifies)

37:52.938 --> 37:55.541
(dog panting)

37:55.574 --> 37:57.443
(roaring)

37:57.476 --> 38:00.312
- Whoa, what's there?
(roaring)

38:00.346 --> 38:03.782
Matt! Matt! Matt!

38:04.883 --> 38:06.352
Matt, do something!

38:06.385 --> 38:08.354
- Tell me when he's on the seal.

38:08.387 --> 38:10.021
- Just, just do it, now!
(roaring)

38:10.055 --> 38:11.823
- Is he drinking the rum?
(roaring)

38:11.857 --> 38:14.993
Tell me when he's
drinking the rum.

38:15.026 --> 38:18.330
- It's tasting me!
- Good.

38:19.531 --> 38:20.766
(inhales, blows across bottle)

38:20.799 --> 38:24.803
(roars, fades away)

38:30.809 --> 38:35.414
(suspenseful music)

38:43.822 --> 38:45.524
(footsteps)

38:45.557 --> 38:47.393
- Work, work, work.

38:47.426 --> 38:50.562
(scoffs) Damn boxes.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.398
Whew!

38:57.636 --> 38:58.970
- Smile!

39:00.406 --> 39:01.873
I need to document this,
otherwise no one back home

39:01.907 --> 39:03.742
will ever believe
you were helpful.

39:03.775 --> 39:05.511
- Ha ha. Now where do
you want me to put this.

39:05.544 --> 39:06.412
This is getting heavy.

39:06.445 --> 39:07.813
- Hold on a minute.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.080
I just want to make sure
you had your eyes open.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.818
(laughs) Looking good Chuck.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.119
- Ok, gimme that.

39:14.152 --> 39:15.821
I don't know, I
think we're going

39:15.854 --> 39:17.155
to have to delete this one.

39:17.188 --> 39:18.824
(guffaws) There's definitely

39:18.857 --> 39:20.426
something wrong.
- (laughs)

39:20.459 --> 39:21.827
Don't delete that!

39:23.061 --> 39:25.831
Hey, there is something there.

39:25.864 --> 39:26.998
What is that?

39:27.032 --> 39:28.434
- I don't know,
probably a lens flare,

39:28.467 --> 39:30.569
or a reflection of the window.

39:30.602 --> 39:32.871
- No, it almost looks
like some kind of animal.

39:32.904 --> 39:34.440
- Yeah, sure it is.

39:34.473 --> 39:35.841
If you want to see
things, I don't know,

39:35.874 --> 39:37.843
maybe look for Elvis or the
Virgin Mary in your soup,

39:37.876 --> 39:40.812
but I am getting hungry,
and it is dinnertime.

39:52.824 --> 39:56.027
(brief ominous music)

40:02.000 --> 40:05.837
- (humming)
(dog panting)

40:07.606 --> 40:09.040
Do you hear that?

40:09.074 --> 40:12.844
- Huh? Oh, that was me, sorry.

40:14.846 --> 40:17.616
- No, not that. It
sounded like a dog.

40:18.850 --> 40:19.785
- That's funny.

40:19.818 --> 40:22.087
Usually I'm the one who
blames it on the dog.

40:57.889 --> 40:59.057
- Could Mr. Fussell's
dog have gotten loose

40:59.090 --> 41:00.592
and come over here?

41:00.626 --> 41:01.860
- How could he get inside

41:01.893 --> 41:02.961
or upstairs without
either of us even know--

41:02.994 --> 41:04.863
- I hear it downstairs now.

41:06.197 --> 41:10.468
(urgent suspenseful music)

41:13.104 --> 41:14.573
- Ugh.

41:22.113 --> 41:23.915
There's nothing
out on the porch.

41:23.949 --> 41:25.183
- There's nothing here either.

41:25.216 --> 41:27.886
It definitely sounded
like a dog though, right?

41:29.220 --> 41:33.825
(crickets chirping)

41:33.859 --> 41:37.128
(various noises from TV)

41:42.267 --> 41:43.869
Looks like you've settled
in for the evening.

41:43.902 --> 41:46.104
- Mm-mm. I got a hot date,

41:46.137 --> 41:48.239
with the pinball machine.

41:48.273 --> 41:50.976
- (chuckles) Sounds like more
exercise than you're used to.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.110
Try not to hurt yourself.

41:52.143 --> 41:53.178
I need you to help
put up decorations

41:53.211 --> 41:54.980
in the morning
before the parade.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.715
- Yeah yeah.

41:57.182 --> 42:00.986
(whistle and explosion on TV)

42:02.854 --> 42:03.855
(door closes)

42:03.889 --> 42:08.059
(TV music, laughter)
- (sighs)

42:09.995 --> 42:11.262
(turns off TV)

42:14.132 --> 42:18.136
(hot tub bubbling)

42:18.169 --> 42:21.973
(pinball machine says "We will
have our revenge," and music)

42:23.875 --> 42:28.880
(clinking and dinging)

42:32.618 --> 42:35.887
(electronic shooting)

42:37.623 --> 42:41.927
(hot tub bubbling,
ominous music)

42:42.160 --> 42:44.062
- (sighs)

43:00.011 --> 43:01.346
(sighs)

43:04.149 --> 43:07.185
(humming)

43:08.019 --> 43:12.924
(dinging and
electronic shooting)

43:24.035 --> 43:25.103
- Son of a--

43:25.136 --> 43:27.906
(electronic whirring down)

43:30.075 --> 43:34.012
(pinball music continues)

43:34.245 --> 43:38.383
(ominous music)
(scraping and a clank)

43:40.118 --> 43:41.653
- Hm.

43:53.965 --> 43:55.200
Hm.

44:03.074 --> 44:04.876
(bottle sloshes)

44:07.278 --> 44:09.347
Guess it can't get any worse.

44:13.351 --> 44:17.188
(hot tub bubbling)

44:32.237 --> 44:34.405
- (humming)

44:36.041 --> 44:40.912
(music grows more ominous)

44:48.954 --> 44:51.022
(hot tub powers down)

44:51.056 --> 44:52.157
(gasps)

44:52.190 --> 44:54.926
Yeah sure it works now
Charlie. What the--

45:02.233 --> 45:06.204
(wind sighing)

45:06.237 --> 45:10.275
(crunching leaves)

45:18.483 --> 45:22.988
(dog panting, leaves crunching)

45:25.891 --> 45:27.358
(water sloshes)

45:35.000 --> 45:39.971
(dog panting, leaves crunching)

45:49.981 --> 45:52.984
(panting more loudly)

46:06.998 --> 46:11.036
(breathes heavily)

46:12.403 --> 46:17.142
(leaves crunching
and dog panting)

46:28.286 --> 46:31.256
(hot tub restarts suddenly)
(gasps)

46:31.289 --> 46:35.026
(hot tub bubbles)

46:39.030 --> 46:42.968
(water sloshes)

46:49.174 --> 46:52.944
(water drips)

46:57.382 --> 46:59.150
Charlie?

47:01.452 --> 47:03.121
Damn.

47:05.323 --> 47:09.060
(pinball music)

47:10.395 --> 47:12.898
(uncorks bottle, spits it out)

47:14.065 --> 47:15.901
(bottle sloshes)

47:15.934 --> 47:18.036
- Whoa. Ugh.

47:18.069 --> 47:22.207
(pinball dings, clanks)

47:23.942 --> 47:26.311
(electronic powering-down noise)

47:26.945 --> 47:29.114
(bottle sloshes)
(moans slightly)

47:33.018 --> 47:34.285
(belch)

47:34.319 --> 47:37.222
(pinball clanks)

47:37.255 --> 47:39.490
(blips, electronic
powering-down noise)

47:40.325 --> 47:41.893
(bottle sloshes)

47:41.927 --> 47:46.031
(ominous music rises)

47:46.531 --> 47:48.133
Whoa.

47:59.244 --> 48:00.979
(thuds to floor)

48:01.012 --> 48:02.948
(ominous music)

48:02.981 --> 48:05.984
(water drips,
bubbling has stopped)

48:20.098 --> 48:23.268
(dog panting)

48:35.981 --> 48:39.017
- (breathes a little heavily)

48:39.050 --> 48:43.021
(dog panting)

48:51.229 --> 48:54.232
(whistles) Toby?

48:54.565 --> 48:56.534
Is that you boy?

48:56.567 --> 48:58.103
Did you sneak out of
Mr. Fussell's yard

48:58.136 --> 49:00.271
to see if we had
any table scraps?

49:00.305 --> 49:03.708
(dog panting, leaves crunching)

49:26.731 --> 49:29.000
(branch cracks loudly)

49:29.034 --> 49:34.005
(dog pants, leaves crunch)

49:57.328 --> 50:01.399
(dog pants)

50:02.433 --> 50:04.535
(whistles)

50:10.175 --> 50:11.542
(gasps)

50:13.111 --> 50:14.245
Damn it, Charlie, not funny.

50:14.279 --> 50:16.214
How long were you out
here waiting for me?

50:16.247 --> 50:19.384
(roars)

50:19.850 --> 50:21.186
That sounds more
like bear than dog.

50:21.219 --> 50:23.788
Come on, we'd better get inside.

50:32.563 --> 50:34.132
(door closes)

50:35.600 --> 50:37.368
Did you drink this whole bottle?

50:37.835 --> 50:38.803
This stuff smells
like you could use it

50:38.836 --> 50:41.806
to de-clog a shower drain.

51:00.258 --> 51:01.426
Everything's locked.

51:01.459 --> 51:04.129
If it is a bear, it won't be
poking its nose around in here.

51:10.535 --> 51:12.403
I really wish you would think
before you drank so much.

51:12.437 --> 51:14.071
You need water.

51:14.439 --> 51:16.841
I don't want you to be
hung over in the morning.

51:16.874 --> 51:18.276
- (bangs against
refrigerator, grunts)

51:18.309 --> 51:19.877
- What the hell's
gotten into you Charlie?

51:19.910 --> 51:21.379
Stop being an asshole.

51:21.412 --> 51:22.480
- (grunting lightly)

51:22.513 --> 51:23.414
- [Blue] They'll
be no more drinking

51:23.448 --> 51:24.349
for you at the party tomorrow.

51:25.416 --> 51:29.120
(music speeds up)

51:31.456 --> 51:32.557
- (grunting) Ohhh.

51:32.590 --> 51:34.792
(sniffs loudly)

51:40.165 --> 51:43.834
- [Blue] (laughs)
Hey! Douchebag!

51:43.868 --> 51:46.804
Enjoy your milk. It'll be the
last time you get so drunk

51:46.837 --> 51:50.275
you forget you're
lactose intolerant.

51:58.483 --> 52:01.886
(gurgling noise)

52:01.919 --> 52:04.255
- Ugh, oh.

52:04.855 --> 52:06.857
Oh, uh.

52:07.492 --> 52:11.462
(shuddering, grunting)

52:11.796 --> 52:13.130
Ugh.

52:13.364 --> 52:17.268
(grunts)

52:23.274 --> 52:27.912
(retches repeatedly)

52:32.317 --> 52:35.420
(dog barking)

52:35.453 --> 52:39.390
(static-y TV background noise)

52:41.992 --> 52:44.362
- Grace, go check on the dog.

52:44.395 --> 52:45.763
(eerie music begins)
- What's a matter with you?

52:45.796 --> 52:46.931
You're sitting right there,
you can't go check on the dog?

52:46.964 --> 52:49.534
- Oh, jeez. Just
go check on him.

52:49.567 --> 52:51.836
- (scoffs) I check
everything myself.

52:51.869 --> 52:54.372
(dog barking)

52:55.473 --> 52:58.343
(dog whining)

53:02.413 --> 53:04.782
Toby. (makes tutting noise)
(dog panting)

53:04.815 --> 53:06.884
Toby. Where are you, boy?

53:06.917 --> 53:08.953
Come here Toby,
come. (tutting noise)

53:08.986 --> 53:13.858
(clicks channel,
static-y sports noises)

53:14.825 --> 53:16.527
- [Mrs. Fussell] Whoa.

53:16.561 --> 53:18.329
- Grace, you ok?

53:25.035 --> 53:27.538
(fast, ominous music)

53:27.572 --> 53:28.273
(dog panting)

53:28.306 --> 53:31.442
(whooshing roar)

53:41.886 --> 53:44.455
- (snoring)
(slow ominous music)

53:47.458 --> 53:49.794
(snoring)

53:49.827 --> 53:53.264
(snorts awake)

53:56.501 --> 53:59.904
(murmurs quietly)

53:59.937 --> 54:04.842
(chiming, mildly ominous music)

54:09.947 --> 54:14.285
(sighing noise)

54:26.431 --> 54:27.965
(Ghostly voice) Blue...

54:31.936 --> 54:33.371
- Charlie?

54:37.875 --> 54:42.480
(eerie music)

54:47.485 --> 54:49.053
DId you call me?

54:52.923 --> 54:54.058
Ugh.

54:57.862 --> 54:58.929
Ugh.

55:02.032 --> 55:03.334
Ugh.

55:03.834 --> 55:05.570
(Charlie thuds to floor)

55:08.138 --> 55:09.306
- Ugh.

55:11.075 --> 55:12.042
- Ugh.

55:18.583 --> 55:22.453
(whooshing)

55:27.425 --> 55:31.829
(static-y noise)

56:05.796 --> 56:07.364
(clicks radio off)

56:08.799 --> 56:11.436
(TV clicks back on)

56:15.906 --> 56:17.842
(clicks TV off)

56:17.875 --> 56:21.812
(screams)
(sudden loud, ominous music)

56:22.547 --> 56:24.915
(thudding down stairs)

56:24.949 --> 56:26.584
(cane clatters)

56:26.617 --> 56:30.154
(urgent music with
"Psycho"-esque strings)

56:38.162 --> 56:40.898
(low whooshing)

56:49.574 --> 56:50.841
(thud)

57:00.184 --> 57:04.822
(train whistles, brakes)

57:04.855 --> 57:09.794
(upbeat music)

57:13.898 --> 57:15.900
- What are all the Xs for?

57:15.933 --> 57:17.868
- Oh, the number
of Xs is relative

57:17.902 --> 57:20.070
to how dangerous
the contents are.

57:20.104 --> 57:21.772
(music becomes more
ominous, low wind noise)

57:21.806 --> 57:22.473
- (chuckles nervously) I
think you should probably

57:22.507 --> 57:23.173
take it with you.

57:23.207 --> 57:24.975
- It'll cost extra.

57:29.547 --> 57:31.782
Well all right, may-maybe we
can work something out, uh--

57:31.816 --> 57:33.050
- You're the best.

57:33.083 --> 57:35.553
Wait, I have something
for you, also.

57:35.586 --> 57:36.654
- Yeah?

57:41.892 --> 57:43.060
- Oh, thank you.

57:43.093 --> 57:45.863
That's exactly what I
expected you to give me.

57:45.896 --> 57:46.931
Great.

57:46.964 --> 57:51.235
(whooshing wind noise)

57:53.571 --> 57:57.875
(clattering,
crashing, low roaring)

57:57.908 --> 57:58.943
- [Matt] (coughing)

57:58.976 --> 58:00.911
(glass breaking, roaring)

58:00.945 --> 58:03.848
(coughing, wind noise)

58:03.881 --> 58:06.617
(coughing)

58:07.985 --> 58:09.253
(coughing)

58:11.321 --> 58:12.857
- What is it?

58:13.858 --> 58:15.225
- Well--
(child laughing)

58:15.259 --> 58:18.829
it has lots of names, actually.

58:19.129 --> 58:21.198
People give lots
of names to hungry,

58:21.231 --> 58:23.868
evil things that
hide in dark corners

58:23.901 --> 58:26.003
and wait for children.

58:26.571 --> 58:31.008
Bloody bones, a Der
Schwarze, a duende.

58:31.041 --> 58:32.977
- What?

58:33.010 --> 58:34.912
- A damn bogeyman.

58:34.945 --> 58:36.914
- Jesus.

58:37.114 --> 58:38.916
- People invoke
all kinds of names

58:38.949 --> 58:41.151
to get their children to behave.

58:42.052 --> 58:46.591
(wheezing cough)

58:46.624 --> 58:48.092
Some of those names are real,

58:48.125 --> 58:50.595
(coughs) and this one certainly
would've eaten your son,

58:50.628 --> 58:52.563
if you hadn't called.

58:54.264 --> 58:56.901
(coughs)
- Why don't you have a seat?

58:56.934 --> 58:59.236
- (coughs and wheezes)

58:59.269 --> 59:02.139
- Are you ok?
- (coughs and wheezes)

59:02.172 --> 59:04.809
- Wait right here, I'll
get you some water.

59:05.042 --> 59:09.279
- (coughs, wheezes,
and hits the floor)

59:16.153 --> 59:21.058
- (inhales, grunts)

59:22.627 --> 59:24.929
(groans) Oh.

59:25.663 --> 59:26.864
What the ...

59:28.899 --> 59:30.100
Where ...

59:31.201 --> 59:34.872
(groans, grunts)

59:37.274 --> 59:38.308
(grunts)

59:41.145 --> 59:43.180
(snorts, grunts)

59:53.290 --> 59:55.693
- Oh, thank goodness.

59:57.427 --> 01:00:02.032
(birds chirping)

01:00:13.678 --> 01:00:17.147
(coffee pouring)

01:00:21.151 --> 01:00:25.656
(birds chirping)

01:00:28.926 --> 01:00:31.896
(yawning) Morning.
Thanks for making coffee.

01:00:31.929 --> 01:00:34.064
- There'd have been none
if I waited for youu.

01:00:37.902 --> 01:00:39.236
- Hey, how did I
end up on the floor

01:00:39.269 --> 01:00:40.971
of your room last night?

01:00:41.005 --> 01:00:42.372
I don't remember a thing.

01:00:42.406 --> 01:00:45.042
- (scoffs) I bet you don't.

01:00:45.075 --> 01:00:48.012
- Yeah, I should probably
lay off that moonshine.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.414
- At least until you
learn some self-control.

01:00:50.447 --> 01:00:51.882
Just because you open a bottle,

01:00:51.916 --> 01:00:53.083
doesn't mean you
have to finish it.

01:00:53.117 --> 01:00:54.251
- I drank a whole bottle!

01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:56.020
- And turned into a total dick.

01:00:56.053 --> 01:00:57.221
- Oh.

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:00.691
Blue, I'm so sorry.

01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:02.927
What did I do?

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:05.329
- I don't know.

01:01:05.362 --> 01:01:07.297
It's like you're a different
person when you drink.

01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:09.266
Just forget about it.

01:01:11.969 --> 01:01:14.004
Finish putting up
the decorations.

01:01:14.038 --> 01:01:16.106
I'm going to shower
before the parade.

01:01:31.956 --> 01:01:34.024
Mr. Fussell? Mrs. Fussell?

01:01:34.058 --> 01:01:35.459
It's Blue. (knocking)
(faint sound of wind)

01:01:35.492 --> 01:01:37.027
Blue Moon, from up the hill.

01:01:37.061 --> 01:01:38.996
(knocking) I think
your dog may have

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:41.098
gotten into our yard last night.

01:01:42.933 --> 01:01:45.736
Just thought
someone should know.

01:02:00.484 --> 01:02:04.088
(louder whooshing noise)

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:11.328
(curtain rustling)

01:02:11.361 --> 01:02:15.900
(bagpipes and drums)

01:02:23.207 --> 01:02:26.977
(sound of crowd, horns honking)

01:02:29.113 --> 01:02:33.183
(percussive upbeat music)

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:46.263
(sirens and honking)

01:02:56.073 --> 01:03:00.010
(honking and bagpipes,
more distantly)

01:03:09.219 --> 01:03:10.955
- Truce?

01:03:13.023 --> 01:03:14.859
It's a holiday.

01:03:14.892 --> 01:03:16.393
Come on, it's fun.
Would you just take it?

01:03:16.426 --> 01:03:17.427
- Ok.

01:03:17.461 --> 01:03:18.262
- It's a pinwheel!
(honking)

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:19.263
It's your favorite.

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:20.430
Thank you.
(honking)

01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:23.200
About last night.
Just, try to let it go.

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:25.002
It was probably
just a power surge

01:03:25.035 --> 01:03:27.404
or a malfunction with the
fuse box or something.

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:28.939
- There was a light!

01:03:28.973 --> 01:03:30.875
- Yes. Televisions have lights?

01:03:30.908 --> 01:03:32.376
You remember, Mr.
Fussell said there was

01:03:32.409 --> 01:03:34.979
something wrong with
the electricity.

01:03:35.012 --> 01:03:37.882
(honking)
- I don't know.

01:03:37.915 --> 01:03:39.984
- You were already
on edge from me,

01:03:40.017 --> 01:03:43.053
and I apologized,
and the dog ...

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:45.322
the bear?

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:46.490
(smacking)

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:47.424
- I want you to look
at it before you leave.

01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:49.159
- Ok, fine, I'll look at it.

01:03:49.193 --> 01:03:50.895
You know I'm no electrician.
(honking)

01:03:50.928 --> 01:03:53.530
Or anything handy. I'll try.

01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:55.365
- Do you think we'll be
able to see the fireworks

01:03:55.399 --> 01:03:57.167
in the bay from
the house tonight?

01:03:57.201 --> 01:03:59.536
- Nah, probably not. But
you know what we could do.

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:01.238
We could all go down to the
beach on our side of the bay.

01:04:01.271 --> 01:04:03.240
At least we'd have
some privacy there.

01:04:03.273 --> 01:04:06.911
(honking, sirens)

01:04:06.944 --> 01:04:10.948
(upbeat electronic music)

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:16.286
(hot tub bubbling)

01:04:17.955 --> 01:04:20.991
- Here, here, here.
Charlie, here.

01:04:26.496 --> 01:04:29.099
(bottles clink)

01:04:29.499 --> 01:04:33.037
- Charlie, what's in these
cases over here by the cooler?

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:34.371
- It's some kind of liquor, man.

01:04:34.404 --> 01:04:36.406
I mean, I think my uncle
was some kind of moonshiner.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.175
- I'd be careful drinking that.

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:39.977
Charlie turned into
a complete asshat

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:41.345
yesterday after drinking some.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:44.048
- (chuckles) It doesn't
take much, does it?

01:04:44.081 --> 01:04:47.952
(dog patters)

01:04:50.287 --> 01:04:51.188
(hot tub bubbles)

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:54.224
(dog barks)

01:04:58.262 --> 01:04:59.529
- Hey, Toby!

01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:02.099
Hey Blue. I told
you Toby got loose.

01:05:02.132 --> 01:05:05.936
(partygoers murmuring)

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:13.944
- And this is the loft.

01:05:13.978 --> 01:05:16.981
Got your haunted TV, a futon.

01:05:17.014 --> 01:05:18.282
- Nice.

01:05:18.315 --> 01:05:19.349
- A pretty chill place.

01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:20.317
- Cool.

01:05:21.018 --> 01:05:22.419
- That was Uncle Matt's bedroom.

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:24.354
I don't know what I'm
going to use it for yet.

01:05:24.388 --> 01:05:25.489
- Cool.

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:30.360
- And that's the tour.

01:05:32.029 --> 01:05:35.966
(partygoers murmuring)

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.268
- Linda. You interested?

01:05:38.302 --> 01:05:40.137
- Sure, what the hell, right?

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:41.571
- Nice!

01:05:44.174 --> 01:05:45.942
(clink cans)

01:05:56.053 --> 01:05:56.987
- Here's two.

01:05:57.021 --> 01:05:58.022
- Sweet.

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:02.759
(uncorks bottle)

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:05.429
(eery music)
- Ugh, that smells disgusting.

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:07.131
Maybe I'll just have a beer.

01:06:07.164 --> 01:06:08.365
- (sniffs) Ugh!

01:06:08.398 --> 01:06:10.400
Smells like my grandfather.

01:06:10.434 --> 01:06:13.037
(pouring liquid)

01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:15.305
So, uh, Charlie was telling me

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:19.743
that he has a pinball
machine, in the basement?

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:25.515
- And you thought that would
entice me downstairs? (laughs)

01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:27.117
- (sighs)

01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:32.322
- Come on, pinball wizard. Let's
see those flipping fingers.

01:06:32.356 --> 01:06:33.257
- Mmm.

01:06:34.258 --> 01:06:38.128
(liquid pouring)

01:06:40.397 --> 01:06:44.568
(wind noise, light growling)

01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:49.039
- (grunting, sniffing)

01:06:49.073 --> 01:06:49.806
(almost meowing
noise, hits the floor)

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:54.244
(chuckling grunting)

01:06:59.116 --> 01:07:00.084
- Burger or dog?

01:07:00.117 --> 01:07:01.251
- Burger.

01:07:01.718 --> 01:07:03.453
- Burger with cheese.

01:07:03.487 --> 01:07:04.354
- Hot dog it is.

01:07:04.388 --> 01:07:05.455
- No I want a burger.

01:07:05.489 --> 01:07:06.390
- Too bad.

01:07:06.423 --> 01:07:08.358
- I want a burger, with cheese.

01:07:08.392 --> 01:07:09.759
- I want to make her a burger,

01:07:09.793 --> 01:07:11.161
and I want to make
you a hot dog.

01:07:11.195 --> 01:07:13.230
- Um, I'm going to
go to the bathroom.

01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:15.299
- I know you know
how to make burgers.

01:07:15.332 --> 01:07:16.700
- Mm, I don't know
how to make burgers.

01:07:16.733 --> 01:07:17.801
I don't even know
what a burger is.

01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:19.236
- Burger, cheese, bun.

01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:20.370
(door closes)

01:07:20.404 --> 01:07:23.473
(continued burger
debate in background)

01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:30.314
(low wind noise)

01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:40.824
(eerie music)

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:46.563
- (grunts, hits floor)

01:07:47.264 --> 01:07:51.501
(grunts, tears fabric)

01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:56.573
(continues grunting)

01:07:59.476 --> 01:08:02.779
Hm. (grunting)

01:08:15.192 --> 01:08:17.294
(squeaking door, breaking glass)

01:08:17.327 --> 01:08:19.863
(grunting, fishing
pole unwinding)

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:47.756
- What an ugly bear.

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:49.859
- Mah!
- (screams)

01:08:49.893 --> 01:08:53.363
- thuds on floor, growls)

01:08:54.198 --> 01:08:56.866
(growls)
- (shrieks)

01:08:56.899 --> 01:09:00.370
- (growls)

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.246
- (shrieks)

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:11.247
- (growls)
(door squeaks)

01:09:11.281 --> 01:09:12.716
(door closes)

01:09:12.749 --> 01:09:15.285
- (screams)
(thumping sound)

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:19.154
- (grumbling and grunting)

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:24.761
- Oh, look at all
this stuff here.

01:09:24.794 --> 01:09:27.231
- Come on. I thought we
were going to play pinball.

01:09:27.264 --> 01:09:29.198
- (grunts)
(glass shatters)

01:09:29.233 --> 01:09:30.367
Damn it! Ugh.

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:31.501
- It's ok--
- (winces)

01:09:31.535 --> 01:09:32.435
- It's not like
it's going to stain

01:09:32.469 --> 01:09:34.438
the basement floor or anything.

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:37.441
- Yeah but. (sighs)

01:09:37.474 --> 01:09:40.777
- Come on.
(glass tinkles)

01:09:51.821 --> 01:09:56.360
- (laughs)
- (both laugh)

01:10:02.899 --> 01:10:06.970
(liquid gurgles, splashes)

01:10:09.439 --> 01:10:10.974
(musical whoosh)

01:10:12.442 --> 01:10:14.278
(music throbs ominously)

01:10:14.311 --> 01:10:16.813
(low growl)

01:10:18.482 --> 01:10:21.518
- (both laugh)

01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:25.289
(whooshes)

01:10:25.322 --> 01:10:29.459
(wet crawling noise)

01:10:34.864 --> 01:10:37.000
(low grunting)

01:10:44.308 --> 01:10:46.476
(wet crawling noise,
dragging bottle)

01:10:46.843 --> 01:10:47.977
- Ah!
- What?

01:10:48.011 --> 01:10:51.381
What, what-what is it? What?
- A mouse.

01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:53.483
- Yeah, but, so what?

01:10:53.517 --> 01:10:55.819
- Get rid of it.
- Where?

01:10:55.852 --> 01:10:58.855
- Someplace where I'm not
fooling around with you.

01:10:58.888 --> 01:11:00.857
Which is going to be
everywhere in a minute.

01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:02.826
- (sighs) Fine ...

01:11:02.859 --> 01:11:06.896
(sighs)
(clicks flashlight on)

01:11:08.365 --> 01:11:11.868
(throbbing music, growling)

01:11:11.901 --> 01:11:13.036
(scoffs)

01:11:13.069 --> 01:11:16.340
(growling, wet noise)

01:11:17.441 --> 01:11:18.475
- Ugh.

01:11:18.508 --> 01:11:20.076
- Nothing here.

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:23.913
(roars)

01:11:26.983 --> 01:11:30.520
(lightly eerie music)
- Who wants overcooked meat?

01:11:30.554 --> 01:11:32.956
- Ugh, gimme that.
- Wait.

01:11:37.594 --> 01:11:38.928
Fair enough.

01:11:38.962 --> 01:11:42.932
(lighthearted music)

01:11:51.941 --> 01:11:52.942
(door closes)

01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:54.978
- (kissing, giggling)

01:12:02.852 --> 01:12:04.788
- Wait, I have to
go to the bathroom.

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:06.390
- (sighs)
- Sorry. I'll be right back.

01:12:06.423 --> 01:12:08.892
- Yeah, hurry up.
- I will.

01:12:09.526 --> 01:12:14.097
(growling)
(chiming music)

01:12:21.971 --> 01:12:23.407
(splashing)

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.810
- So, there's a pinball
machine in the basement.

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:28.011
- I don't think so.

01:12:28.044 --> 01:12:29.946
- But, but I'm a pinball wizard.

01:12:29.979 --> 01:12:31.080
- Uh, no.

01:12:31.114 --> 01:12:34.551
(chiming noise, low whooshing)

01:12:35.485 --> 01:12:36.953
(door opens)

01:12:38.121 --> 01:12:39.856
- Ugh.

01:12:42.592 --> 01:12:44.828
- (grunts) Mmm.

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:48.097
(women murmuring outside)

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:50.867
- (sighs) Now I gotta change.

01:12:51.935 --> 01:12:54.938
(lighthearted music)

01:12:55.539 --> 01:12:58.608
- Your friend Dana? Asleep
in my bed for some reason?

01:12:58.642 --> 01:13:00.977
- She was sitting in the
sun all afternoon drinking.

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:02.912
That could wipe anybody out.

01:13:02.946 --> 01:13:04.448
- It would have been nice
if she asked permission

01:13:04.481 --> 01:13:06.416
before she just
crawled right in.

01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:09.118
- It's my bed! It's my
house, I really don't think

01:13:09.152 --> 01:13:10.987
you need to be getting
possessive over it.

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:12.922
- Right, everything
here is yours.

01:13:12.956 --> 01:13:14.458
- That's right.

01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:15.859
And that bed was where
Mom and Dad slept anyway.

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:17.527
Your bed was the top bunk,

01:13:17.561 --> 01:13:18.862
and the only thing
keeping you from it

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:20.497
is a pile of junk mail.

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:23.166
Feel free to clean it off if
you suddenly need to lie down.

01:13:24.033 --> 01:13:25.401
- Ooh.

01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:39.983
- Oh, what'd you
do, fall asleep?

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:44.621
I'll wake you up.
Tickle, tickle.

01:13:44.654 --> 01:13:46.523
(bed creaks)
(giggles)

01:13:46.556 --> 01:13:48.492
- What are you doing?

01:13:48.525 --> 01:13:51.427
- (screams)
- (both shriek)

01:13:52.161 --> 01:13:54.831
(eery music)

01:13:54.864 --> 01:13:57.867
(footsteps thud down
stairs, door closes)

01:13:57.901 --> 01:13:59.536
- Hey. Hey, where
are you guys going?

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:04.140
(whooshing noises)

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:09.112
(eerie electronic music)

01:14:16.052 --> 01:14:19.656
(whooshes)

01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:27.897
(people chattering)

01:14:29.599 --> 01:14:33.870
(music gets more suspenseful)

01:14:39.843 --> 01:14:44.480
(ominous piano music)
(people laughing, chuckling)

01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:58.061
(water bubbling)

01:14:58.094 --> 01:15:01.064
- Hey Blue. When are the
fireworks gonna start?

01:15:01.097 --> 01:15:02.799
- Uh, it's getting dark now.

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:03.867
We should probably
head down to the beach

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:05.101
if we wanna get there in time.

01:15:05.134 --> 01:15:06.603
You know.

01:15:07.904 --> 01:15:10.073
(sparklers crackle)
- It's gettin' kind of cold

01:15:10.106 --> 01:15:11.841
for Fourth of July.
- Yeah.

01:15:11.875 --> 01:15:13.543
- Maybe I'll get a jacket.

01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:16.846
- Look, please
don't say anything.

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.015
Blue is already freaked
out from last night.

01:15:19.048 --> 01:15:21.184
Just keep this on the
down-low, all right?

01:15:21.217 --> 01:15:23.086
You guys, just relax, trust me?

01:15:23.119 --> 01:15:24.588
(bottles clink)

01:15:24.621 --> 01:15:25.922
Have a little drink,

01:15:25.955 --> 01:15:27.290
it'll be ok.
- Hey, we were going

01:15:27.323 --> 01:15:29.125
to take those down to the--
- Shut up, Blue's friend.

01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:31.561
Just have a drink,
it'll all be fine.

01:15:31.595 --> 01:15:33.597
You didn't even see anything.

01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:34.831
- I know what I saw.

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:36.332
- You said you didn't
even see a thing!

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:39.669
- Blue, can we take the
bottles down to the beach?

01:15:40.303 --> 01:15:42.872
- Yeah sure, knock
yourselves out.

01:15:43.072 --> 01:15:44.874
- You know what? Fine.

01:15:44.908 --> 01:15:48.111
(low horn blows)

01:15:48.645 --> 01:15:51.214
(people murmur in background)

01:15:51.247 --> 01:15:54.217
- [Male] Here we go!
(bell tolls)

01:16:01.858 --> 01:16:05.328
(crickets chirping)
(people murmur in background)

01:16:06.329 --> 01:16:10.233
- [Creature] (grunts)

01:16:10.266 --> 01:16:11.868
(door squeaks)
(upbeat, eerie music)

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:16.606
(insistent muttering growling)

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:27.951
- (strums instrument)
(whooshing wind noise)

01:16:32.956 --> 01:16:34.858
- [Woman] Race you
down to the beach!

01:16:34.891 --> 01:16:36.960
- [Blue] It's getting
kind of chilly.

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:39.996
Maybe we should
bring some jackets.

01:16:40.029 --> 01:16:41.931
(door shuts)

01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:45.134
(door squeaks open)

01:16:45.168 --> 01:16:49.939
- (strums instrument)

01:16:49.973 --> 01:16:51.875
- Hey. We're all headin'
down to the beach. You ready?

01:16:51.908 --> 01:16:53.677
- Nah, you guys go ahead.

01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:55.011
Not really feeling up to it.
(mellow instrumental music)

01:16:55.044 --> 01:16:56.946
- (scoffs) Why you being
such a douche this weekend?

01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:57.881
You can't just come
out on the beach

01:16:57.914 --> 01:16:59.348
and enjoy the fireworks
with the rest of us?

01:16:59.382 --> 01:17:01.084
- You know, they're
your friends, not mine.

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:02.285
- You're my friend too.

01:17:02.318 --> 01:17:03.820
- I'm your brother.

01:17:03.853 --> 01:17:05.154
- Exactly. We can see each other

01:17:05.188 --> 01:17:07.090
only when obligated
to by family stuff

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:09.158
and not be bothered with
the rest of the year?

01:17:09.192 --> 01:17:10.960
But that's not how we
are. We're friends.

01:17:10.994 --> 01:17:13.262
(low whooshing noise)
We do things together.

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:16.933
- Are we? Or am I just here
to help you move your crap?

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:20.103
(music grows more suspenseful)

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:20.870
(thrown object
crinkles against Blue)

01:17:20.904 --> 01:17:22.071
- (scoffs) Ugh.

01:17:22.105 --> 01:17:23.840
I can't believe you!
You can't even accept

01:17:23.873 --> 01:17:25.875
when someone is trying
to be nice to you.

01:17:28.044 --> 01:17:30.680
- (shrieks and plops
onto the floor)

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:35.051
(floor creaks, door thuds shut)

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:38.421
- What the ...

01:17:40.924 --> 01:17:45.929
(bed springs creak)
- (sniffles)

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:03.980
- (knocks)

01:18:07.884 --> 01:18:09.953
- (sniffs) I don't have
anything else to say to you.

01:18:09.986 --> 01:18:11.888
Just leave, go home. (sniffs)

01:18:11.921 --> 01:18:13.289
- [Charlie] Blue--
- (grunts, thuds onto bed)

01:18:13.322 --> 01:18:16.192
- really sorry about the way
I've been acting all weekend.

01:18:16.225 --> 01:18:20.229
- (sniffs) No you're not.

01:18:20.263 --> 01:18:22.298
If you didn't want to come,
you shouldn't have come.

01:18:22.331 --> 01:18:25.001
I thought you'd be
excited for me. (sniffs)

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:26.235
- [Creature] (growls)
(thumping, ominous music)

01:18:26.269 --> 01:18:27.904
- (sighs)

01:18:27.937 --> 01:18:29.906
Look. It's pretty obvious
I'm jealous of you.

01:18:29.939 --> 01:18:32.909
Getting your own place?
- (sniffs)

01:18:32.942 --> 01:18:34.878
- And I get to be one
of those guys, you know?

01:18:34.911 --> 01:18:38.347
Almost 30 and still living
at home with mom and dad.

01:18:40.483 --> 01:18:43.452
- (grunts)

01:18:43.486 --> 01:18:45.321
- And you're absolutely right.

01:18:45.354 --> 01:18:48.324
I mean, we're not just related.

01:18:48.357 --> 01:18:52.195
(thumping music, growling)

01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:55.865
You're my best friend.
- (growls, grunts)

01:18:55.899 --> 01:18:58.334

01:21:55.144 --> 01:21:56.379
Enclosed in this package,

01:21:56.412 --> 01:22:01.250
please find the remains
of one Matthew Moon,

01:22:01.284 --> 01:22:03.987
delivered in accordance
with his final wishes.

01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:06.255
For over a decade, I had
the pleasure of employing

01:22:06.289 --> 01:22:08.191
this peculiar and efficient man

01:22:08.224 --> 01:22:10.326
who claimed to be your uncle.

01:22:10.359 --> 01:22:13.262
Unfortunately, our relationship
rarely went beyond business.

01:22:13.296 --> 01:22:15.999
In fact, all I really knew
about his personal life

01:22:16.032 --> 01:22:18.301
is your name and
his home address,

01:22:18.334 --> 01:22:21.304
where I shipped a great deal
of usual cargo on his behalf.

01:22:21.337 --> 01:22:23.973
- Moses? Bagg?

01:22:24.007 --> 01:22:25.374
- [Voiceover] I feel
compelled to warn you.

01:22:25.408 --> 01:22:27.443
Do not open any liquor
bottles you find

01:22:27.476 --> 01:22:28.978
among Matt's possessions.

01:22:29.012 --> 01:22:30.046
- [Creature] (moans)
- [Voiceover] And never

01:22:30.079 --> 01:22:31.447
let anyone drink from them--

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:32.982
- Oh my God.
- [Voiceover] They're cursed.

01:22:33.016 --> 01:22:33.482
- The bottles!

01:22:33.516 --> 01:22:37.586

Don't! O-open the bottles!

Don't--
