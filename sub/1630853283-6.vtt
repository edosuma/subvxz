WEBVTT

00:21.980 --> 00:23.982
Right there! Right up there.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.651
That's where your brother
wanted to put a hot tub.

00:26.735 --> 00:29.195
I mean, it was his dream.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.989
Shane:
And he gave Berkman 1,700?

00:30.989 --> 00:34.033
Yeah! I mean, it sounded like
a game-changer to me,

00:34.117 --> 00:36.661
but you know Berkman,
he was against it.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.872
What kind of dick...

00:38.872 --> 00:40.415
says no to a hot tub
right there?

00:40.415 --> 00:43.209
I don't know!
What kind of-- what...

00:43.293 --> 00:45.670
Fuckin' crazy! Right?

00:45.754 --> 00:48.631
I mean,
it's absolutely nuts, am I...

00:48.715 --> 00:50.508
Am I right? Anyway, y-you...

00:50.592 --> 00:53.636
you got his address.
You call me when it's done.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.972
I'm gonna be checking out
a friend of mine in LA--

01:04.355 --> 01:05.982
Let's go.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.468
Mae Dunn:
One of the bodies
we pulled out of

01:33.468 --> 01:35.386
the Northridge house explosion

01:35.470 --> 01:37.347
was Fernando Sagredo,

01:37.347 --> 01:38.681
the head of the Bolivians.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.683
So, we must have
gotten to the nursery

01:40.767 --> 01:43.561
in the middle of
them getting payback.

01:43.645 --> 01:44.729
Right, so that means

01:44.813 --> 01:47.565
it was NoHo Hank
who planted that bomb.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.652
NoHo is soft.

01:50.652 --> 01:51.986
I mean, look at
the way he dresses.

01:52.070 --> 01:55.073
He is not the
bomb-planting type. This...

01:55.073 --> 01:57.992
- was the Raven.
- Okay, look.

01:58.076 --> 02:01.621
You think
Rumpelstiltskin over here

02:01.621 --> 02:04.165
could take out a whole monastery
of goons all by himself?

02:04.249 --> 02:07.043
No, I ain't buying it.
I ain't buying it, no.

02:08.670 --> 02:11.381
No, no, no, no.
Our guy is highly trained.

02:11.381 --> 02:14.551
He's probably, like,
ex-military or s...

02:14.551 --> 02:17.053
Well, how do we know
Rumper-stiltskin over here

02:17.137 --> 02:19.931
isn't some kind of badass?
I mean... I mean...

02:19.931 --> 02:23.685
Look at his jacket, right?
It-it's leather, and it's cool.

02:26.187 --> 02:29.149
Albert Nguyen:
Have you heard from Berkman?

02:29.149 --> 02:30.942
- Barry?
- Albert: Yeah.

02:30.942 --> 02:32.610
Uh, we haven't seen him

02:32.694 --> 02:35.446
since he did that
charity drive for Chris.

02:35.530 --> 02:39.325
He said he was taking
acting classes.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.620
- No, no, no.
- Yes!

02:42.704 --> 02:43.913
Barry Berkman,

02:43.997 --> 02:47.208
the human ice machine,
is taking acting classes?

02:47.292 --> 02:49.794
He seems to like it!

02:50.587 --> 02:51.713
Ah...

02:52.630 --> 02:54.090
Is he still out here in LA?

02:54.090 --> 02:56.634
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he is.

02:58.469 --> 02:59.637
We should all get together.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.890
Yeah.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.976
Yeah, no, I-I'd love
to see him. Yeah.

03:06.102 --> 03:08.813
- I'll call him.
- Theo: Mom!

03:08.897 --> 03:12.150
- Can I go shoot some hoops at Victor's?
- Sure, honey.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.157
He's all grown up now.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.287
Sally:
And then this algorithm
killed my show,

03:24.287 --> 03:26.998
and I'm just feeling
really lost, you know?

03:26.998 --> 03:30.126
And now, my agent wants me to go
and take a meeting at BanShe.

03:30.126 --> 03:32.462
- You don't wanna work with those dudes.
- I know!

03:32.462 --> 03:34.839
Yeah, I used to be a baker
at this kickass churro shop

03:34.923 --> 03:36.424
in Eagle Rock.

03:36.424 --> 03:38.593
It was cushy as fuck. Like...

03:38.593 --> 03:40.845
I could've rode
that shit forever,

03:40.929 --> 03:44.724
but I knew I had to
level up to beignets.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.809
Well, all the churro
dudes were like,

03:46.893 --> 03:49.771
"Rein in your ambitions, Mitch,"
but I was like...

03:51.064 --> 03:52.357
nah.

03:53.441 --> 03:57.278
And now, and I say this
in all humility,

03:57.362 --> 03:59.447
my place is the shit.

03:59.447 --> 04:03.076
And that's all because
I believed in my own abilities.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.787
I never really thought
about it that way.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.330
I know.

04:07.330 --> 04:11.209
Oh my god, that's heaven.

04:11.209 --> 04:14.671
- Jesus Christ, get a life.
- Sally: Sorry that took so long.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.506
Oh my god, I dream about these.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.925
We can't just give up
on "Joplin." I mean,

04:18.925 --> 04:21.135
maybe we try another
streaming service?

04:21.219 --> 04:22.512
Let's see what BanShe
has to say.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.514
They have another project
they'd like to work with you on.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.891
But I don't know if I wanna
work with those dudes.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.685
I think you should
at least hear them out.

04:28.685 --> 04:33.439
- Did you get the dipping sauce?
- Maybe we start our own streaming service.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.984
You get the fuck away from me!

04:43.616 --> 04:44.951
Barry: Hello?

04:44.951 --> 04:46.995
- Sharon <i>Barry?</i>
- Barry: Yes.

04:46.995 --> 04:49.747
Sharon:
<i>Hi, it's Sharon, Chris' wife.</i>

04:49.831 --> 04:52.667
Hi. Hi. How are you?
Uh, what's wrong?

04:52.667 --> 04:55.211
Nothing's wrong. How are you?

04:55.211 --> 04:56.921
I'm fine. I'm fine.

04:58.506 --> 05:00.925
- Uh, how are you?
- Sharon: <i>Good.</i>

05:01.009 --> 05:03.761
- I saw that article about you.
- Barry: <i>Oh yeah.</i>

05:03.845 --> 05:05.722
Yeah, that was...
H-how's your son?

05:05.722 --> 05:07.306
- Sharon: <i>He's good.</i>
- Yeah?

05:07.390 --> 05:10.226
Sharon:
<i>Um, look, I-I'm putting
together a dinner</i>

05:10.310 --> 05:12.270
for some of the vets
from my charity,

05:12.270 --> 05:14.022
<i>and I'd love for you to come.</i>

05:15.940 --> 05:19.193
Yeah. No, that'd be great. When?

05:19.277 --> 05:22.113
Um, I'm thinking tonight.
Is that crazy?

05:22.113 --> 05:24.782
That's not crazy at all. Yeah.
No, just send me your address.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.534
That's great.

05:26.534 --> 05:29.078
A-a-absolutely great for me.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.581
- Great.
- Uh, hey, can I bring something?

05:31.581 --> 05:33.332
- No, no.
- Barry: <i>No, no, no.</i>

05:33.416 --> 05:35.251
I know exactly
what I'm gonna bring
and it's gonna be great.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.753
And you're gonna love it
'cause they're delicious.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.839
Okay, well,
I-I'll talk to you soon.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.090
- Barry: <i>Alright.</i>
- Okay.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.925
I'll talk to you later,
or I'll see you tonight.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.219
Yeah, send me your address.
Okay. Love you.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.096
I, uh...

05:47.180 --> 05:49.015
I didn't mean to say I love you.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.600
I don't know why
I just said that, okay?

05:50.600 --> 05:52.268
<i>Sorry. I just went through
a bad breakup.</i>

05:52.268 --> 05:55.772
<i>- I'm in a bad place.</i>
- No, no. It-it's all good. It's all good.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.440
You know what I mean?

05:58.399 --> 06:00.902
Uh...

06:00.902 --> 06:04.238
I thought you were
gonna hang up.
Y-- I'll hang up. Okay. Bye.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.866
This is great.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.926
<i>Sí, sí...</i>

07:28.364 --> 07:30.449
Ow. Oh...

07:38.166 --> 07:40.376
Anita:
Are you feeling better?

07:45.131 --> 07:46.924
Holy smokes.

08:00.188 --> 08:03.649
I'm so fucked!
Everything is so fucked!

08:05.276 --> 08:06.986
So now, you know,

08:06.986 --> 08:09.280
my business is, like,
completely burned down

08:09.280 --> 08:11.032
and cops are on my tail,

08:11.032 --> 08:13.326
and they took my Cristobal.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.203
This dude lied to you,

08:15.203 --> 08:16.704
didn't tell you he was married,

08:16.704 --> 08:18.748
didn't tell you
he was straight.

08:18.748 --> 08:22.084
Now don't get me wrong.
He sounds like a real catch,

08:22.168 --> 08:24.045
but those are massive
red flags, bro.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.296
So,

08:25.296 --> 08:28.716
I go down to Bolivia
and say, like, you know,

08:28.716 --> 08:30.968
like, no more red flags, right?

08:31.052 --> 08:32.762
Mitch:
Hey, dude, look.

08:32.762 --> 08:35.056
I know we just met,

08:35.056 --> 08:36.766
but you seem, like...

08:37.850 --> 08:39.435
kind of rad.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.939
My shit's about to franchise.

08:42.939 --> 08:45.066
We could run this
business together.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.946
Yeah...

08:49.946 --> 08:54.075
You know, I might need
a few days to, you know...

08:54.075 --> 08:56.118
mull that over.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.455
Mitch:
So... Wednesday?

08:59.455 --> 09:01.123
Yeah...

09:01.916 --> 09:04.085
- Okay, bye.
- Late.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.214
I had that talk
with my daughter.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.383
And?

09:17.473 --> 09:19.433
Can you handle
more amazing news?

09:19.517 --> 09:22.436
- How did you get into my house?
- Bob Jacobsen.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.772
You know who that is?
Producer.

09:24.772 --> 09:25.898
He did the "Wonder Man" films.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.275
You can't just
break into my house.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.693
He's moving into
the streaming space,

09:28.693 --> 09:31.028
which is now creeping
into the theater space.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.948
The guy was so moved by
what you did as a teacher,

09:33.948 --> 09:37.243
he wants to give you
your own show.

09:37.243 --> 09:41.414
"The Gene Cousineau
Master Class."

09:41.414 --> 09:43.374
- "Master Class"?
- That's right.

09:43.374 --> 09:45.334
You with the students.
You know, working with them

09:45.418 --> 09:46.836
like you did with that vet,
that Shawn.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.005
- Barry...
- Teaching them everything about acting.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.924
Unlocking all the weird shit
that motivates them.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.134
Saving their lives.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.344
It's going to be streaming
into people's homes,

09:55.428 --> 09:59.307
but he also wants to put it
in movie theaters.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.934
- What's his opening offer?
- 400,000.

10:02.018 --> 10:05.187
But I think
I can talk him way up.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.650
Alright.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.819
I'll do it, under one condition.

10:11.819 --> 10:14.238
Oh, please.
Leave my classroom.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.823
I don't wanna have to
get a restraining order

10:15.823 --> 10:17.074
- against you.
- You're not listening.

10:17.158 --> 10:19.160
You get to direct
all of these stage shows,

10:19.160 --> 10:21.162
and they shoot out
all over the world!

10:21.162 --> 10:22.538
I'm not interested
in helping you

10:22.538 --> 10:24.373
with your little
Master Class.
Now, go.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.959
- And there's the problem. It's not my Master Class.
- Keep your voice down.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.378
It's not my Master Class.
It is a collaboration.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.380
We do it together. I didn't--

10:31.464 --> 10:35.509
I said I wouldn't do this
unless you got a bigger piece.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.970
- Oh, fuck you.
- No!

10:38.054 --> 10:39.972
Alright, 80-20.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.891
I don't need your charity.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.355
Take it all.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.900
- Bullshit.
- Try me.

10:54.945 --> 10:58.532
If I were you,
I would think about it.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.967
Fuches: Mm...

11:19.136 --> 11:20.846
So,

11:20.930 --> 11:24.141
what do you a-and your people
call... water?

11:25.518 --> 11:27.269
Water.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.022
You know you're only
20 miles outside of LA.

11:30.106 --> 11:33.484
There's a Starbucks
right over that hill.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.152
Wow, that's

11:35.236 --> 11:37.071
That's incredible-- Shit.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.531
Uh-- Oh, I'm sorry.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.241
- It's okay.
- Gotta... Yeah.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.701
Jesus fuckin' Christ, what?!

11:42.785 --> 11:44.870
- Jim Moss <i>Is this Ken Goulet?</i>
- Fuches: Yeah.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.414
This is Jim Moss.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.791
My daughter was
Detective Janice Moss.

11:48.791 --> 11:52.628
<i>You called me about
some information
regarding her murder.</i>

11:52.628 --> 11:55.673
I'd like to meet
and discuss this.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.974
You know what?

12:04.974 --> 12:08.018
Never mind. I made a mistake.
I'm sorry I bothered you.

12:17.027 --> 12:20.406
Hey, Sally, exclamation point.

12:20.406 --> 12:23.534
I just wanted to say
I appreciate you

12:23.534 --> 12:25.077
for calling me out

12:25.161 --> 12:26.745
for being a, quote,

12:26.829 --> 12:30.291
"violent asshole," end quote.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.501
I am sorry for all the shit

12:32.585 --> 12:36.630
I put you through over
the past couple of weeks.

12:36.714 --> 12:41.218
Parentheses, yelling at
you at work, comma,

12:41.302 --> 12:44.722
offering to break into
your boss' house,

12:44.722 --> 12:46.015
comma,

12:46.015 --> 12:48.517
take sleeping pictures of her,

12:48.601 --> 12:50.644
et cetera, et cetera,

12:50.728 --> 12:53.814
end parentheses, wincing emoji.

12:55.733 --> 13:00.112
There is no excuses for that.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.198
B. Period.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.658
S. Exclamation point.

13:04.742 --> 13:08.329
Exclamation point.
Exclamation point.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.831
- Oh man.
- "This looks nice, and it's 40% off.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.584
"Anyway, I don't think I'm
going to do acting anymore.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.586
"I found a new community
with my Marine friends.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.963
"I'm trying to move forward
by going into the past

13:18.047 --> 13:19.715
"like Marty McFly. LOL.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.717
"Sir, you're talking too loud.
Shit, I'm sorry.

13:21.717 --> 13:25.095
"Just please be quack ye
shame Jonas Brothers haha fresh.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.848
"Sally, I understand if you do
not want to talk to me again.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.225
"I will five you spaceship

13:29.225 --> 13:32.728
brittle teeth in
the sunshine. Barry."

13:32.728 --> 13:35.898
Jesus Christ.
You dodged a bullet.

13:35.898 --> 13:39.151
Sally Reed!
Morgan Dawn-Cherry.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.571
Okay, so excited
to have you here.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.949
- Massive, massive fan.
- Thanks.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.743
So, what is this new project
you guys have for Sally?

13:47.743 --> 13:51.288
Okay. Okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.540
So, um,

13:52.540 --> 13:55.376
this new project we have,
it's called "The New Medusas,"

13:55.376 --> 13:57.211
and we think it could really use

13:57.211 --> 13:59.171
- the Sally Reed touch.
- Sally: The show that

13:59.255 --> 14:01.257
replaced "Joplin"
on the homepage?

14:01.257 --> 14:03.717
Not the best pickup line,
I know, but hear me out.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.095
So, it's a show
about three women

14:06.095 --> 14:08.097
who run a salon in SoHo,

14:08.097 --> 14:10.391
who are just trying to get by,

14:10.391 --> 14:12.268
and they have snakes for hair,

14:12.268 --> 14:15.020
and they turn dudes into stone.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.066
- Okay...
- So, right now,

14:19.066 --> 14:20.693
the show,

14:20.693 --> 14:23.779
it's a little,
I don't know, "mm?"

14:23.779 --> 14:26.407
And I think that you,
Sally Reed,

14:26.407 --> 14:29.743
could bring to it
more of a, "mm!"

14:29.827 --> 14:30.911
Mm.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.289
I don't know what you mean.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.083
So, right now, the show,
it's more...

14:36.083 --> 14:37.418
"yeah."

14:37.418 --> 14:40.504
And you could bring it
to more of a, "yeah!"

14:40.588 --> 14:42.047
Lindsay:
I-I think I know
what you're saying.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.842
I have a client right now
that's bringing "yeah!"

14:44.842 --> 14:47.011
to a Fox show that
before was just,

14:48.429 --> 14:49.972
So, we're looking for less

14:49.972 --> 14:51.473
and more

14:51.557 --> 14:53.309
Lindsay:
That actually wasn't
in the email.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.311
Sally doesn't do

14:55.311 --> 14:58.188
She does, "yeah!"
She does "no!"

14:58.272 --> 15:00.774
And she'll do like...

15:00.858 --> 15:03.777
Okay. I understand.
So instead of...

15:04.528 --> 15:05.904
It's more...

15:13.662 --> 15:15.873
Lindsay:
I really think
you should do it.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.127
It'll give you
time to audition,

15:20.127 --> 15:22.838
to develop your next
project, it's...

15:23.756 --> 15:25.674
Writer's room?

15:25.758 --> 15:27.926
Isn't that kind of a demotion?

15:28.010 --> 15:30.846
Shouldn't I be trying
to pitch my own show?

15:30.846 --> 15:33.098
Look, it's good money,
and, more importantly,

15:33.182 --> 15:35.893
it preserves your
relationship with BanShe,

15:35.893 --> 15:38.103
which is important.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.358
Alright, I'll do it.

15:43.734 --> 15:46.153
Love it! Yes!

15:46.153 --> 15:48.280
- Sally: What's the money?
- Lindsay: Woo! It's good.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.616
It's good. We'll get it up.
We'll get it up.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.741
Are you tied up in...

16:32.825 --> 16:35.619
- some bad business?
- Fuches: I was.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.123
Trying to put it behind me.

16:44.878 --> 16:46.588
My daughter, Anita...

16:47.339 --> 16:49.633
She likes you.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.553
I think she wants to be
boyfriend and girlfriend.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.310
Told her you seem
like a good man.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.523
I'm working on it, amigo.

17:07.985 --> 17:11.655
Sometimes, you have to abide
by the signs God gives you.

17:14.158 --> 17:16.535
You said something there.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.328
Anita's Father:
I'll be right back.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.623
Anita wants to
make dinner for us.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.671
Hope you like spicy.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.424
Fantastic.

17:50.152 --> 17:53.363
Abide by the signs
God gives you.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.885
Fuches: Mr. Moss.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.512
Kenneth Goulet.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.515
I actually have some
very interesting information

18:19.515 --> 18:21.683
<i>about who
killed your daughter.</i>

18:21.767 --> 18:24.353
<i>Can we meet?</i>

18:24.353 --> 18:26.688
Absolutely.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.774
- Yeah, okay.
- So, one, two...

18:28.774 --> 18:30.651
I was walking down the street,

18:30.651 --> 18:34.446
And, uh, I-I came to my house,

18:34.530 --> 18:35.864
and I w-walked up the stairs.

18:35.948 --> 18:39.034
And then I opened up a door.

18:41.245 --> 18:44.373
A-and then I went to the
bathroom, and I was like...

18:44.373 --> 18:48.001
- Zip...
- W-what's going on here?

18:48.085 --> 18:50.963
- So then I left the bathroom.
- Oh.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.507
And there was... and uh...

18:53.507 --> 18:55.509
and then they were
having a meeting.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.181
And the first person to
speak at that meeting

19:01.265 --> 19:04.226
- was Jesse Jackson.
- Je--

19:04.226 --> 19:06.353
- Jesse. Go ahead, do it.
- J-- Um...

19:06.353 --> 19:07.479
Be Jesse Jackson.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.994
What's "Beg-nets by Mitch"?

19:24.454 --> 19:27.124
You haven't seen
these dudes in five years?

19:27.124 --> 19:29.585
Uh, it's more like 12.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.086
Huh.

19:31.086 --> 19:33.088
Yeah, I'd tread lightly
if I were you.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.590
Why?

19:34.590 --> 19:37.009
Mitch:
People change, man. Like,

19:37.009 --> 19:39.052
this one time, I went
to this 10-year reunion

19:39.136 --> 19:41.972
with these guys
I used to deal drugs with.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.558
And they just, like,
weren't the same dudes.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.226
Like, this one guy was,
like, super MAGA,

19:46.310 --> 19:48.854
trying to get me
on anti-CRT shit.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.856
And the other dude
made me watch videos

19:50.856 --> 19:54.818
of dads rapping.
It was corny as fuck.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.321
Yeah, I don't see these guys
being like that.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.780
You don't know.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.241
Trust me. Like...

20:01.325 --> 20:02.701
I would do like, a Zoom sesh

20:02.701 --> 20:05.120
