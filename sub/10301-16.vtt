01:29.560 --> 01:33.678
So this is where they work the magic
that makes you look 55.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.355
- Just stand still, Al.
- What? What?

01:38.560 --> 01:41.836
I'm trimming your nose hairs.

01:42.040 --> 01:46.113
You know, you have to keep them nice
and even or you'll get split ends.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.068
All right, honey, give me money
and get out of here.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.589
I can't possibly relax
with you around.

01:51.800 --> 01:55.270
Besides, I don't bother you at work.
Don't bother me here.

01:55.520 --> 01:58.239
Oh, that's what you call it now, Peg,
"work"?

01:58.520 --> 02:02.513
Al, my job is to look good
and feel good.

02:02.720 --> 02:05.393
You know how soft I am.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.353
Well, actually, you don't.

02:08.560 --> 02:12.269
But I know how soft I am,
and believe me, I'm a delight.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.309
Oh, excuse me here.
I want to prepay.

02:15.520 --> 02:19.832
How much for
the 100,000-mile overhaul?

02:20.080 --> 02:22.992
While you're working on her,
can I get a loaner?

02:23.840 --> 02:27.071
You got anything in the back
that has that new-hooter smell?

02:28.160 --> 02:30.720
Just pay the man
and baboon away to work.

02:30.920 --> 02:34.230
- That'll be $300, sir.
- Three hundred dollars!

02:34.440 --> 02:37.830
She didn't cost that much
when she was new.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.389
I'm gonna see
what people pay $300 for.

02:43.240 --> 02:46.073
Great Caesar's ghost!

02:46.280 --> 02:48.510
And I mean that, literally.

02:49.960 --> 02:54.033
Well, now, this one's a little more
reasonable. A dollar a chin.

02:54.880 --> 02:57.030
You people ought to be ashamed
of yourself.

02:57.280 --> 03:00.750
Who but a woman would spend time
in a place like this?

03:01.520 --> 03:03.238
Hi, Al.

03:04.840 --> 03:08.549
- Hey, how about those Bulls.
- They'll be all right. They got Jordan.

03:08.800 --> 03:12.236
No, no, not them. I'm talking about
those two under the dryers.

03:16.480 --> 03:19.358
- What are you doing here?
- I'm getting the macho package.

03:19.560 --> 03:23.792
You know, the hair, nails and facial.
We call it the Bogie.

03:25.280 --> 03:28.989
I mean, I'm a topless dancer and the
smoke in the bar can wreak havoc...

03:29.200 --> 03:32.112
...with the pH balance of my hair
and my skin.

03:32.320 --> 03:38.077
Oh, once the hair and the skin goes-
Well, I don't have to tell you.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.238
I've seen about enough.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.032
Peg.

03:43.240 --> 03:45.800
I'm going where a man belongs.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.471
Crouched on his knees in front
of a fat woman, selling her shoes.

03:50.680 --> 03:55.117
Rolling back the flesh of the ankle,
trying to find the foot.

03:55.320 --> 03:58.869
Who cries for my pH balance,
Argentina?

03:59.120 --> 04:01.509
All right. There you go.
Do what you can with her...

04:01.720 --> 04:05.872
...and what you can't fix
just slap a coat of paint on.

04:10.840 --> 04:16.517
Oh, God, I hope he never finds out
that half this money is legally his.

04:16.720 --> 04:19.951
Of course I should get more.
I mean, I gave everything to him...

04:20.160 --> 04:22.594
...including my virginity.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.671
Hello, girls.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.750
There we go.

04:30.920 --> 04:33.115
When did you start drawing?

04:33.320 --> 04:37.472
Oh, about an hour after
my pulsating showerhead broke.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.477
A woman's gotta have something.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.114
Of course, Al has given me
no encouragement.

04:42.320 --> 04:45.073
Not even when I drew him
a picture of his favourite dinner...

04:45.280 --> 04:47.111
...and left it on the table.

04:47.760 --> 04:51.548
He ate it and said,
" Next time, draw it hot. "

04:51.760 --> 04:55.878
I swear, these men just think
that our lives are one big ball.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.911
You know, we are so unappreciated.

04:58.120 --> 04:59.997
<i>Now, take Marcie.
She's always complaining:</i>

05:00.200 --> 05:02.191
"Why isn't my dinner ready
when I come home?"

05:02.400 --> 05:04.914
Hey, because I'm busy, bitch!

05:10.280 --> 05:12.714
Mr. Jeffy. Mr. Jeffy.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.318
Antoine.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.875
<i>Can you fit me in
for a 3:00 massage today?</i>

05:18.080 --> 05:22.119
<i>Well, I do have a 3:00 appointment,
but let her stew.</i>

05:22.320 --> 05:26.677
Yeah, besides,
most women come after me anyway.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.917
I'm really gonna miss Antoine.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.759
I heard he joined the Marines.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.676
Hi, everyone.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.838
<i>I'm Antoine's 3:00.
Is he ready for me?</i>

05:43.040 --> 05:45.554
I'm sorry, but Antoine
is backed up right now.

05:47.520 --> 05:51.957
So I'm shunted aside for some
damn blond hussy, no doubt.

05:52.160 --> 05:55.630
That damn Antoine.
I have had it with his mood swings.

05:55.920 --> 06:00.038
- I'll tell Antoine you're displeased.
- Oh, no, no, no. Please.

06:00.680 --> 06:05.231
I've already had two warnings.
One more complaint and I'm out.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.351
I'll wait like a good girl.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.070
Hi, Peggy.

06:12.360 --> 06:15.432
God, what's that horrible smell?

06:15.640 --> 06:18.154
I have Al's wallet.

06:18.360 --> 06:23.275
Great. Now I can find out whose face
is on the $100,000 bill.

06:24.360 --> 06:28.114
- So, what's new?
- Well, Bertha just lost 35 pounds...

06:28.320 --> 06:31.471
...on that
eat-nothing-bigger-than-your-head diet.

06:35.040 --> 06:38.350
Peggy, that drawing is great.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.278
It's Al.

06:40.480 --> 06:43.358
Look how she's got
the hunch just right.

06:43.560 --> 06:46.791
And those taters growing out
of his ears.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.312
They go so well with the gravy
under his arms.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.791
It is perfect, Peggy.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.390
Look how you made his socks
kill all the flowers.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.194
You know, I just can't get over this.

07:02.400 --> 07:06.439
It's so real, the drawing needs
a shower.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.511
It should be in a magazine.
You know...

07:08.720 --> 07:10.950
...there's a new woman's magazine
just starting...

07:11.160 --> 07:15.119
...that came into my bank for a loan.
I bet I can get them to use this.

07:15.320 --> 07:17.595
What are you gonna call
your new cartoon?

07:17.800 --> 07:21.679
Well, how about
Mr. Can't-Hit-the-Toilet?

07:22.280 --> 07:25.272
That could be any man.
Be more specific.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.875
<i>How about:
Mr. Al-Can't-Hit-the-Toilet?</i>

07:28.680 --> 07:30.989
Eat your cone, Bertha.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.716
Does it need a title?

07:33.920 --> 07:37.629
I mean, just looking at him is enough
to make you laugh.

07:46.240 --> 07:50.438
You know, Peg, you have the look of a
woman who just swallowed a canary.

07:50.640 --> 07:53.313
Bertha, you have the look of a woman
who swallowed a cow...

07:53.520 --> 07:55.351
...who swallowed a canary.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.030
And, Marcie...

07:59.800 --> 08:01.791
...you look like a chicken.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.997
Enough charm.
What happened to my wallet?

08:08.200 --> 08:10.270
- You took it, didn't you?
- Of course I did.

08:10.480 --> 08:14.439
Who else but your wife would go
near the back of your pants?

08:14.680 --> 08:16.352
I thought we had an agreement.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.596
Every since I got deported
to Mexico...

08:18.800 --> 08:21.917
...you promised to at least leave me
with a picture ID.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.391
- Did something happen, Al?
- Well, I-

08:24.600 --> 08:27.797
<i>I don't wanna ruin it for you.
It'll be on TV tonight.</i>

08:28.000 --> 08:31.959
<i>It seems that the TV show Cops
was filming in Chicago.</i>

08:32.159 --> 08:34.720
They have that new
oversized graphite nightstick...

08:34.919 --> 08:37.308
...you know, with the bigger
sweet spot?

08:37.520 --> 08:40.034
They've been waiting
to try it on anybody bold enough...

08:40.240 --> 08:43.515
...to stop in the middle of the street
and cry, " My wallet's missing. "

08:43.760 --> 08:46.354
I'm on right after Todd Bridges.
Nice kid, by the way.

08:47.560 --> 08:50.358
So, Peg, if it's not
too much trouble...

08:50.560 --> 08:52.869
...don't ever leave me
with empty pants again.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.148
That's it.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.635
Al just named my cartoon.

08:58.840 --> 09:01.957
Mr. Empty-Pants.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.713
Hi, Peggy.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.718
<i>Here's the latest edition of
Modern Gal Weekly.</i>

09:10.920 --> 09:12.876
Mr. Empty-Pants is a smash.

09:13.080 --> 09:16.277
- I hope you don't run out of material.
- Oh, not a chance.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.313
The only thing that separates Al
from an actual cartoon...

09:19.520 --> 09:20.999
...is that he has a thumb.

09:23.360 --> 09:26.511
Oh, wonder how he feels
being portrayed as Mr. Empty-Pants.

09:27.320 --> 09:31.279
Gee, you think
I should have told him?

09:31.480 --> 09:34.313
Oh, what for. Al will never find out.

09:34.520 --> 09:37.956
He wouldn't read a magazine
that has "woman" in the title.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.596
Unless, of course, the O had
a little nipple in the centre.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.468
<i>Oh, great. Women are talking.</i>

09:47.680 --> 09:50.240
<i>I guess you folks are wondering
why I don't leave.</i>

09:50.480 --> 09:53.677
<i>Well, my head is stuck
and I can't get out.</i>

10:02.640 --> 10:06.952
Peg, everywhere I go, people
are pointing at me and laughing.

10:08.160 --> 10:11.357
That can't be a recent thing.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.999
Let me finish.

10:13.200 --> 10:16.351
Now they're call me
Mr. Empty-Pants.

10:16.560 --> 10:21.076
Is that some kind of new, hip,
rap term, you know, for "full pants"?

10:21.280 --> 10:24.716
You know, sort of like how bad
means good, and this means that.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.355
That's all, folks.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.149
Hey.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.794
Hey. What you doing, Peg?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.913
Look at that guy
standing in dog doody.

10:40.120 --> 10:41.712
Bird's doinking doody on his head...

10:41.920 --> 10:45.674
...and then the others birds on them
branches coming out of his nose.

10:46.640 --> 10:50.235
Boy, life really kicked the hell
out of him, huh? What a loser.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.916
Who is he?

10:53.680 --> 10:56.194
Hey, now, wait a minute.

10:56.400 --> 11:00.279
Those sweat stains, that beaten look,
that dumb expression...

11:00.480 --> 11:02.277
...that's Bud.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.117
Peg. That's great.

11:06.320 --> 11:09.073
Does the boy know you're
making fun of him? I won't tell him.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.874
- It's just our little secret.
- It's you, Al.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.232
Me?

11:16.440 --> 11:18.670
That ain't funny.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.955
I don't wanna be Mr. Empty-Pants.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.639
Peg, you've ruined me.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.512
Al, you're a shoe salesman.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.473
How can you ruin a shoe salesman?

11:28.760 --> 11:31.320
It's like dropping dirt on dirt.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.557
Besides, it's just a little local
woman's magazine.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.672
So a few people recognize you
on the street and laugh.

11:37.880 --> 11:40.519
If Martha Raye and Joe Piscopo
can live with it...

11:40.720 --> 11:43.029
...then so can you.

11:43.240 --> 11:48.758
<i>Besides, most people don't even know
it's you. Just relax and watch TV.</i>

11:49.880 --> 11:52.155
<i>And on the local scene,
a comic-strip character...</i>

11:52.360 --> 11:54.999
<i>...called Mr. Empty-Pants,
that started out...</i>

11:55.200 --> 11:58.829
<i>...in a small area publication,
is catching on nationwide.</i>

11:59.120 --> 12:01.714
<i>It's about a hapless loser
who just can't get it done.</i>

12:03.360 --> 12:07.433
<i>News Team 56 has found out that
Mr. Empty-Pants is, in fact...</i>

12:07.640 --> 12:11.269
<i>...a local shoe salesman
by the name of Al Bundy.</i>

12:14.840 --> 12:18.071
- Are you happy now?
- Not yet.

12:18.280 --> 12:22.034
<i>The cartoon was drawn by
a local woman, Peggy Bundy.</i>

12:22.240 --> 12:24.470
Now I'm happy!

12:33.560 --> 12:35.630
Look, there's Mr. Empty-Pants!

12:36.280 --> 12:38.555
Hey, Empty, my man.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.073
Al, can't you handle the fame?

12:49.280 --> 12:52.431
I mean, they still call
Carroll O'Connor "Archie. "

12:52.640 --> 12:54.870
They still call that Winky guy
"the Fonz. "

12:55.080 --> 12:58.755
<i>And, you know, they still call
the fat girls on The Facts of Life...</i>

12:58.960 --> 13:01.599
<i>..."the fat girls on The Facts of Life. "</i>

13:02.000 --> 13:03.194
Oh, come on, honey.

13:03.400 --> 13:07.154
How could you not get some joy out
of a busload of Japanese tourists...

13:07.360 --> 13:12.388
...taking pictures and screaming out,
" Me rike Empty Pants"?

13:14.920 --> 13:18.629
Well, they found out my pants weren't
so empty when I mooned them.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.872
That ought to pay them back
for Pearl Harbor.

13:33.520 --> 13:36.193
Daddy, I'm glad you're home.

13:37.320 --> 13:40.073
You're sad because people
are laughing at you, aren't you?

13:40.360 --> 13:42.396
Yes.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.477
Well, that and...

13:44.680 --> 13:49.356
...because I married your mother.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.955
Well, I think that it's the name
that's hurting you.

13:52.160 --> 13:56.756
You're embarrassed because people
are calling you Mr. Dirty-Pants.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.712
No, it's Empty Pants.

13:59.720 --> 14:03.110
That would mean a total absence
of genitalia.

14:04.040 --> 14:07.476
Anyway, I just think that you're taking
the totally wrong attitude on this.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.477
I mean, you're like the pessimist...

14:09.680 --> 14:13.559
...who looks at his pants
and thinks they're half-empty.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.111
You should be more
like the optometrist...

14:17.320 --> 14:21.359
...who looks at his pants
and thinks they're half-full.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.759
Get her out of here, Peg. Right now.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.476
Honey, why don't you go downtown
to the Hall of Records...

14:28.680 --> 14:30.955
...and find out what our address is.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.197
Okey-dokey.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.595
I'm tired of going down there.

14:36.800 --> 14:40.395
This time, I'm gonna write it next to
the numbers on the front of the house.

14:42.280 --> 14:45.431
Anyway, Daddy, if it helps any,
when I'm feeling down...

14:45.640 --> 14:48.791
...I just think of this little poem,
and it always cheers me up.

14:49.880 --> 14:53.714
<i>Once upon a midnight dreary
As I wandered, weak and weary</i>

14:53.920 --> 14:57.117
<i>Quoth the raven "Demi Moore. "</i>

14:59.360 --> 15:01.191
Edgar Bergen Poe.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.398
" Miss Empty-Head" didn't cross
your mind, did it?

15:11.680 --> 15:12.874
Can't you be happy?

15:13.080 --> 15:15.071
For years, you've been
absolutely nothing.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.840
And now, you're the man behind
the woman.

15:18.320 --> 15:21.312
I always stand behind you, Peg.
It's cooler in the summer.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.753
Well, Al, I have a bit of news
that just might cheer you up.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.638
What? Spotted owls swooped down...

15:27.840 --> 15:30.195
...and pecked the eyes out
of some environmentalists?

15:30.440 --> 15:31.634
No.

15:31.840 --> 15:35.037
I have decided it is time
for Mr. Empty-Pants...

15:35.240 --> 15:36.912
...to finally break his silence.

15:37.120 --> 15:40.556
Now, it has to be something special.
Short but memorable.

15:40.760 --> 15:42.318
A signature if you will.

15:42.520 --> 15:43.714
So come on, honey...

15:43.920 --> 15:47.196
...be like Homer Simpson and "d'oh. "

15:48.240 --> 15:51.994
I'm not a cartoon.
I'm almost a human being, damn it.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.677
I want you to stop writing
Mr. Empty-Pants.

15:54.920 --> 15:57.957
As a matter of fact,
I'm putting my foot down.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.435
From this minute on, I'm no longer
Mr. Empty-Pants.

16:00.680 --> 16:04.195
I am not- Not Mr. Empty-Pants.

16:07.440 --> 16:08.873
Hello?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.274
Yes, I am Mr. Empty-Pants.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.517
I'll see you there.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.239
Well, who was that on the phone?

16:18.560 --> 16:21.233
<i>That's Playgirl magazine, Peg.</i>

16:23.880 --> 16:27.236
They're gonna put Mr. Empty-Pants
in the centrefold. That's me, Peg.

16:27.440 --> 16:30.193
They're saying
I'm the sex symbol of the '90s.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.033
Did I miss the news?

16:36.240 --> 16:39.152
Did every other man on earth die?

16:39.360 --> 16:40.509
Where are you going?

16:40.760 --> 16:43.797
Well, the shoot's next week.
I figured I'd shower now. Why wait?

17:12.960 --> 17:14.632
Ladies...

17:15.160 --> 17:16.991
...allow me to introduce myself.

17:17.240 --> 17:21.551
<i>I'm Loren Michaels, producer of
Mr. Empty-Pants, the movie.</i>

17:21.920 --> 17:24.877
Now, we' re casting
a very important part.

17:25.079 --> 17:26.832
Buttocks.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.515
You all qualify.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.349
Now, rehearsals start
in the broom closet in five minutes.

17:37.720 --> 17:41.269
Hey, wait a second. Just a minute ago
you were the body-makeup guy.

17:42.440 --> 17:43.668
Hey, babe.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.598
I'm going places.

17:45.800 --> 17:49.952
Hopefully, this place, this place
and that place.

17:51.880 --> 17:54.553
Make way for Mr. Empty-Pants.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.834
He is empty.

18:13.480 --> 18:17.393
Okay. E.P., these are the girls who'll
be doing the centrefold with you.

18:17.720 --> 18:21.429
After the shoot, I'm going to shake
every one of your hooters.

18:24.200 --> 18:27.237
The bigger the star,
the nicer the guy.

18:27.480 --> 18:33.237
Well, Empty, look. Before we put you
on the bearskin rug with the ladies...

18:33.440 --> 18:37.877
...we'd like a few shots, you know,
so we can capture the inner emptiness.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.355
Meantime I think we need
some powder on the girls.

18:40.560 --> 18:42.039
Makeup!

18:44.680 --> 18:46.830
Those breasts are shiny.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.678
Take off those tops.

18:48.880 --> 18:52.714
And don't worry about me
getting excited. I'm gay.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.309
All right, all right.
The boy's had enough fun.

18:55.520 --> 18:56.794
Now let's go. Let's go.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.036
I gotta get loose. Play my music.

18:59.240 --> 19:00.639
Helps me shake my money-maker.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.319
Okay, let's do the shot on the rug.

19:38.960 --> 19:42.475
Okay. Hold it. Hold it.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.836
Wrap the shoot. We-

19:45.040 --> 19:46.632
We have to find another centrefold.

19:46.840 --> 19:50.196
Mr. Empty-Pants has been killed
in the latest strip.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.159
Okay, girls, let's take a break.

20:00.440 --> 20:01.998
No. No, don't take my breasts away.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.395
- Girls, let's go.
- No. No.

20:06.920 --> 20:08.069
Excuse me, ladies.

20:08.320 --> 20:11.710
Bud Bundy here,
Department of Makeup Safety.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.751
If left on, that stuff can kill.

20:15.120 --> 20:18.590
Yes, it must be licked off immediately.

20:18.800 --> 20:22.190
Believe me, I'll receive no pleasure
from this, other than a job well done.

20:22.400 --> 20:25.278
Now, quickly, de-top and meet me
on the mattresses in the alley.

20:25.480 --> 20:29.029
And hurry. Hurry! Your chests are
ticking time bombs.

20:37.080 --> 20:38.672
Can't believe it.

20:38.880 --> 20:41.348
Just this close to being happy.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.672
Who could have done this to me?

20:44.920 --> 20:46.194
Hi, honey.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.633
Peg, why did you do it?

20:50.120 --> 20:53.317
I had to. I was jealous.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.397
I wasn't getting
any attention anymore.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.636
Suddenly everybody
was just talking to you...

20:57.840 --> 20:59.558
...and nobody cared about me.

20:59.760 --> 21:03.469
I couldn't handle your happiness.
So I killed you.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.557
You're not mad, are you?

21:05.760 --> 21:08.672
I mean, if it's any consolation
you always have me.

21:08.960 --> 21:12.669
Peg, if it's any consolation to you,
it's no consolation to me.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.074
How'd you kill me, Peg?

21:14.760 --> 21:18.389
You were crushed by a meteorite
shaped like a lady's shoe.

21:23.160 --> 21:26.596
- Did I suffer?
- Sure.

21:26.800 --> 21:27.994
What do you say, Al?

21:28.200 --> 21:31.033
How about a portrait of
Mr. and Mrs. Empty-Pants?

21:31.280 --> 21:33.635
Why not? It'll probably be
the last picture of us...

21:33.840 --> 21:35.353
...with your head still on.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.117
You know, Peg, I'm not surprised.
I knew I was gonna lose.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.311
<i>But I'll tell you
who the big losers are:</i>

21:55.520 --> 21:57.078
The women of America.

21:57.280 --> 21:59.475
Because they could have had me
in the centrefold.

21:59.680 --> 22:02.240
Now they're gonna settle for
some cheap imitation.

22:02.440 --> 22:05.955
I mean, who are they going to get
that's as big a loser as me?
