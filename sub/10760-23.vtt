- Hey, Daphne.
- Hello, Roz, Alice.

00:15.857 --> 00:18.347
- What brings you here?
- We're borrowing Frasier's car.

00:18.567 --> 00:21.232
Oh, l see. And you're leaving
Alice here as collateral.

00:21.441 --> 00:23.267
Actually,
he's being very nice about it.

00:23.442 --> 00:25.728
Mine's in the shop,
and l'm taking Alice and her friends

00:25.900 --> 00:27.013
to an ice cream party.

00:27.232 --> 00:29.936
You told me it was your friends
and the Science Centre.

00:30.109 --> 00:32.774
He said, she said,
we'll never know what really happened.

00:32.941 --> 00:36.805
Frasier, don't be so uptight.
l'm not gonna hurt your precious car.

00:36.983 --> 00:39.470
l am not uptight. l've just had
unfortunate experiences before

00:39.648 --> 00:40.894
loaning out my car.

00:41.067 --> 00:45.689
DAPHNE: l left an umbrella in the trunk.
- lt was a wet umbrella.

00:46.275 --> 00:48.229
Can l have the keys?

00:49.191 --> 00:51.858
Yes, yes.

00:52.067 --> 00:55.893
After all, what are fine possessions for
if not to be used and enjoyed?

00:56.440 --> 00:58.231
And who better to enjoy them

00:58.441 --> 01:01.723
than the delightful souls
of small children?

01:01.940 --> 01:04.394
- l'll put a tarp in the back seat.
- Oh, bless you.

01:04.608 --> 01:06.100
- Hey, Roz. Hello, Alice.
ROZ: Hey.

01:06.273 --> 01:08.394
- What brings you here?
- Frasier loaned me his car.

01:08.565 --> 01:10.437
l backed mine into a telephone pole.

01:10.649 --> 01:13.600
- You said you were getting a tune-up.
- lt needs one, trust me.

01:15.399 --> 01:17.437
- ls Daphne ready?
- Uh...

01:17.607 --> 01:19.893
Actually, l think she's in her room.
You two have plans?

01:20.065 --> 01:21.890
Yes, l am taking her
to the botanical gardens.

01:22.065 --> 01:24.305
Can you believe
she's never been before?

01:24.523 --> 01:27.226
Didn't Donny take her
to the botanical gardens last year?

01:27.441 --> 01:30.473
Can you believe
she's never been before?

01:32.858 --> 01:35.475
- Hey, Daphne.
- Hello, Niles.

01:35.648 --> 01:36.927
NlLES:
Ready to go to the gardens?

01:37.106 --> 01:39.430
l'm afraid l'm gonna have to take Eddie
for a walk first.

01:39.607 --> 01:41.396
- Where's Dad?
- l don't know, he's gone.

01:41.564 --> 01:43.057
Here, l'll take him for a quick walk.

01:43.231 --> 01:46.182
DAPHNE: Oh, no, he's gonna need
more than that. He'll go stir crazy.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.347
He's gonna need a full run
at the dog park.

01:48.523 --> 01:50.182
We don't have time
to go to the dog park.

01:50.357 --> 01:53.022
The tour of succulents
starts promptly at 1 2.

01:53.231 --> 01:55.268
- Hey Frasier, can you take him?
- No, l'm sorry.

01:55.439 --> 01:56.519
Roz has my car, you see,

01:56.691 --> 01:59.438
and Lana's coming to pick me up
for a tutoring session with Kirby.

01:59.606 --> 02:00.979
Oh, l'll just get Eddie's toys.

02:01.147 --> 02:02.475
Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.

02:02.648 --> 02:04.803
l need to make
an emergency appointment tomorrow

02:04.980 --> 02:07.516
for a complete cleaning of my BMW.

02:08.149 --> 02:09.639
June 1 0th?

02:09.814 --> 02:13.060
But l have
a Clean Team Privileges Card.

02:13.230 --> 02:15.767
Yes, of course, it's a platinum one.

02:16.480 --> 02:18.021
No.

02:18.188 --> 02:20.973
No, there are no diamonds
on the corner.

02:21.522 --> 02:25.268
Well, yes, l'd like to become a member
of the Diamond Alliance immediately.

02:25.815 --> 02:27.188
Fine.

02:27.356 --> 02:31.848
Put me on the waiting list.
l'll see you in June.

02:34.355 --> 02:37.519
- You're not in the Diamond Alliance?
- Don't do that.

02:42.940 --> 02:44.515
- So this is it.
- Mm-hm.

02:44.689 --> 02:47.093
l'd hardly call this a dog park.

02:47.272 --> 02:51.562
lt's more like a dog orgy.
Whose beagles are those?

02:51.729 --> 02:54.978
Don't stare. lt only encourages them.

02:56.730 --> 02:57.843
All right, hurry up, Eddie.

02:58.021 --> 03:00.558
There's lots of exciting depravity
to explore.

03:01.272 --> 03:03.427
He wants to play a little fetch.

03:03.604 --> 03:06.273
- Oh, here, you throw it.
- With my bare hands?

03:06.439 --> 03:09.519
- Come on, it's fun.
- All right, ready?

03:09.688 --> 03:12.603
Here we go, and fetch.

03:14.855 --> 03:16.679
l didn't give you
enough of a challenge here.

03:16.854 --> 03:19.094
Come here. You ready? Ready?
And...

03:19.271 --> 03:20.894
Go get it.

03:22.354 --> 03:23.978
l'm sorry. l was a bit of a grouch.

03:24.147 --> 03:26.978
This is actually a fine way
to spend the day.

03:27.145 --> 03:30.477
ln fact, it's kind of...

03:33.521 --> 03:34.929
Hello.

03:35.771 --> 03:38.260
Do you suppose the rest of Eddie's
in there?

03:38.895 --> 03:40.637
JlM:
Good boy, good boy.

03:40.812 --> 03:42.187
Sorry about that, Daphne,

03:42.396 --> 03:44.849
but with the organic vitamin paste
l've been feeding Tank,

03:45.020 --> 03:47.474
Eddie can't keep up with him
anymore.

03:47.938 --> 03:49.395
lt's no problem, Jim.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.974
Niles, this is Jim Brady and Tank.
This is Niles, my boyfriend.

03:53.188 --> 03:55.675
- lt's a pleasure.
- Boyfriend? l should have known.

03:55.854 --> 03:57.761
Every time l'm single,
you're in a relationship

03:57.937 --> 04:00.058
and every time you're single,
l'm in a relationship.

04:00.229 --> 04:01.426
Yeah, that's true.

04:01.604 --> 04:03.759
- l guess we just don't have good--
- Timing.

04:03.936 --> 04:05.514
Exactly.

04:05.730 --> 04:10.219
- And l'm a drummer.
- Which makes it even more ironic.

04:13.562 --> 04:16.845
Tank, that's rude. Now, chill.

04:18.810 --> 04:22.391
Wow, you've really got him trained.
That's the problem with Eddie.

04:22.562 --> 04:24.967
He only listens if he thinks
he's gonna get food.

04:25.145 --> 04:27.597
Or one of my socks.

04:29.104 --> 04:31.342
But mostly food.

04:31.769 --> 04:33.226
lt's all in the voice tone, really.

04:33.393 --> 04:36.310
Any dog can learn to respond to it,
even an old wheezer like Eddie.

04:36.478 --> 04:38.432
- You want me to show you?
- l'd love it.

04:38.644 --> 04:39.674
Come on. Come on, buddy.

04:39.852 --> 04:41.843
Yeah, we'd all love it.

04:42.144 --> 04:43.222
[CELL PHONE RlNGlNG]

04:43.394 --> 04:46.595
You guys go ahead.

04:47.145 --> 04:48.721
Yes.

04:48.894 --> 04:51.464
- Hello?
- Hi, Niles, it's me.

04:51.643 --> 04:53.884
l just want to make sure
Daphne took Eddie for a walk.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.051
l completely forgot about him
this morning.

04:56.269 --> 04:57.762
Yeah, yeah,
we're in the dog park now.

04:57.936 --> 05:01.182
- Where are you, anyway?
- l'm at the track.

05:01.352 --> 05:02.809
l had an itch for it when l woke up

05:02.976 --> 05:05.466
and so l just dropped everything
and went.

05:05.852 --> 05:07.677
l'm at the window.

05:08.102 --> 05:10.556
l'll have a trifecta in the eighth.

05:10.728 --> 05:11.758
Gotta run.

05:26.434 --> 05:29.219
Well, l didn't realise l was gonna be
selling houses with you today.

05:29.393 --> 05:31.549
Why didn't you drop me off
and then come on your own?

05:31.725 --> 05:34.642
Stop whining. lt'll only take a minute.

05:34.810 --> 05:37.345
l hope we don't run into the sad sack
who owns this place.

05:37.851 --> 05:39.759
l've been trying to sell this house
for a year,

05:39.935 --> 05:42.505
and he keeps driving away
every potential buyer.

05:42.726 --> 05:46.388
- How does he do that?
- Oh, hi.

05:47.976 --> 05:49.006
l heard a woman's voice.

05:49.184 --> 05:52.550
l thought it might be my wife
coming back to me.

05:53.018 --> 05:57.142
No. She lives in Portland now with
her new husband Lamar, remember?

05:57.935 --> 06:00.766
Oh, excuse me, Frasier Crane,
Phillip Donovan, the current owner.

06:00.934 --> 06:01.966
- Hello.
- Hi.

06:02.144 --> 06:03.884
LANA: l'll see you later, Phillip.
- Anyway,

06:04.059 --> 06:08.219
my wife just left with the kids.
No talking, no explanations,

06:08.435 --> 06:11.716
just ripped my heart out,
threw it to the dogs.

06:11.892 --> 06:14.347
Which she also took.

06:15.351 --> 06:19.213
Well, at least you're getting out
at the top of the market.

06:19.391 --> 06:22.391
Actually, this is a very good time,
Phillip, and l think today is the day.

06:22.558 --> 06:24.181
- Oh, no.
- Oh, God.

06:24.350 --> 06:25.631
What's wrong?

06:25.810 --> 06:27.515
The damn basement
must have flooded again.

06:27.684 --> 06:30.172
Everything in this box is ruined.

06:30.349 --> 06:34.343
Little Susie's cap she wore home
from the hospital. Ruined.

06:34.558 --> 06:37.890
Danny's first soccer uniform. Ruined.

06:38.060 --> 06:40.725
Well, you know,
l have an excellent dry cleaner.

06:40.892 --> 06:42.513
LANA:
No.

06:44.392 --> 06:50.838
Once, actually, l spilled butter
on a pair of white velvet pantaloons.

06:51.558 --> 06:55.635
Well, it's a long story,
but he had it out in under a minute.

06:55.809 --> 06:57.467
- Just give him the address.
FRASlER: Yes.

06:57.641 --> 07:02.429
l have two sons and two daughters.
The perfect American family.

07:02.600 --> 07:07.174
Until that bastard Lamar showed up
to snake our drains.

07:07.808 --> 07:10.758
Now all l have left are weekend visits

07:10.932 --> 07:13.847
and a few treasures
from their childhood.

07:14.016 --> 07:18.141
Like this house little Danny and l
made at day camp.

07:18.308 --> 07:21.305
Oh, thank goodness,
it made it through unscathed.

07:21.515 --> 07:24.515
Just a little water damage
in the basement.

07:24.684 --> 07:27.680
- Just like this house.
- Oh, well...

07:27.849 --> 07:31.843
Yes, well, Phillip,
you are still their father.

07:32.016 --> 07:34.171
l mean,
l know things seem difficult right now,

07:34.348 --> 07:35.891
but believe me, it'll get easier.

07:36.100 --> 07:40.045
Well, it's already easier.
l mean, look at me, l'm dressed.

07:40.265 --> 07:43.181
You know what would cheer you up
is to make a killing on this house.

07:43.599 --> 07:45.553
Now don't you think
you should get back to work?

07:45.723 --> 07:46.753
Yeah, l guess.

07:46.931 --> 07:49.800
That air traffic
isn't gonna control itself.

07:51.848 --> 07:54.005
LANA: Okay, here we go out--
No, not the front door.

07:54.183 --> 07:57.096
Let's go out the side door.
Gosh, good to see you again, Phillip.

07:57.265 --> 07:59.671
l'll call you real soon. Thanks, bye.

08:00.016 --> 08:02.171
Well, that man is obviously in pain.

08:02.348 --> 08:05.051
The least you could be
is a little sympathetic.

08:05.224 --> 08:08.588
l have been sympathetic
for 1 5 months.

08:08.764 --> 08:10.719
l had him over for Thanksgiving.

08:11.349 --> 08:13.753
He got drunk the first half-hour
and cried himself to sleep

08:13.931 --> 08:16.134
in my coat closet.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.340
And l consider that
one of our good days.

08:18.515 --> 08:22.675
Well, so where are these
so-called buyers of yours?

08:22.849 --> 08:25.419
- You told me they'd be here.
- They're obviously running late.

08:25.598 --> 08:28.263
- lt'll give us time to go over the plan.
- What? There's a plan?

08:28.432 --> 08:31.547
Well, sure. When the Smolenski's get
here, you act like you want the house.

08:31.722 --> 08:34.390
You know, a little competition.
Put a little pressure on the deal.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.179
You're asking me to be your shill?

08:36.347 --> 08:38.136
That's the word. Yes, yes.

08:39.179 --> 08:41.467
Now listen, listen.
No, you don't have to say anything.

08:41.640 --> 08:44.126
- Well, l'm sorry, no.
- Well, why the--?

08:44.305 --> 08:47.469
Look, all you have to do is walk around
with an interested look on your face.

08:47.639 --> 08:49.925
- They'll fill in the rest.
- l will do no such thing.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.800
- Why won't you help me?
- Because l refuse to lie for you.

08:53.015 --> 08:55.846
- Fine, then go wait in the car.
- l never wanted to leave the car.

08:56.013 --> 08:57.043
Oh, just get out!

09:10.140 --> 09:12.212
All right, l got some Creamsicles,
and Fudgesicles,

09:12.388 --> 09:15.589
and something they call Bomb Pops.

09:15.764 --> 09:18.382
Well, l called the Smolenskis.
l bought us a little extra time.

09:18.555 --> 09:23.296
Right, good, good, fine. Spread out
some paper and then build us a house.

09:23.472 --> 09:27.004
So, Frasier,
with all your talk about honesty,

09:27.181 --> 09:29.052
how do you justify faking this thing?

09:29.264 --> 09:33.472
Well, we're simply protecting
the feelings of an innocent man.

09:33.639 --> 09:35.878
There's nothing dishonest
about that.

09:36.096 --> 09:37.423
Uh-huh.

09:37.596 --> 09:43.213
So, are you gonna write,
''l love you, Daddy'' or am l?

09:45.222 --> 09:47.046
l'll do it.

09:50.345 --> 09:53.095
Sit. Wave, wave.

09:53.263 --> 09:55.548
All right, hide your eyes.
Hide your eyes.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.588
Hide them, hide them.
Hide your eyes.

09:57.763 --> 09:58.959
- Hide your eyes.
- Hello.

09:59.138 --> 10:01.423
JlM: Come on, hide your eyes.
Hide your eyes.

10:01.595 --> 10:04.167
Hey, Eddie,
don't worry about that other dog.

10:04.346 --> 10:09.086
He may be bigger and flashier
and better looking,

10:09.262 --> 10:12.462
but you have substance.
She knows that.

10:12.679 --> 10:14.587
DAPHNE:
How amazing is Jim?

10:14.763 --> 10:18.257
He's so connected to animals,
it's almost magical.

10:19.053 --> 10:21.803
Daphne, l've been musing
about you and me.

10:21.970 --> 10:23.546
- And l have a thought.
DAPHNE: Yeah?

10:23.720 --> 10:25.176
ln every healthy relationship,

10:25.344 --> 10:27.336
l think there should be room
for an occasional,

10:27.512 --> 10:30.343
very occasional, irrational demand.

10:30.511 --> 10:32.503
What do you mean?

10:32.679 --> 10:36.339
A thing we insist the other do
or not do,

10:36.511 --> 10:40.291
and the other one has to do it
or not do it without question.

10:40.469 --> 10:43.040
- ls that fair?
- lt is.

10:43.221 --> 10:47.545
Because we each get one and
only one for our whole relationship.

10:48.094 --> 10:51.093
- Well, if it's important to you.
- Then it's agreed?

10:51.262 --> 10:53.547
- Agreed.
- Good.

10:54.427 --> 10:56.419
Oh, l've got mine.

10:57.303 --> 10:58.796
- Already?
- Yes.

10:58.969 --> 11:02.750
l want you to promise
never to come to this dog park again.

11:03.220 --> 11:05.837
- What?
- l know it sounds extreme,

11:06.010 --> 11:09.957
it's even unreasonable, but that's
the beauty of the irrational demand.

11:10.636 --> 11:12.258
ls this about Jim?

11:13.095 --> 11:17.881
The demand cannot be scrutinised.
lt's by definition, irrational.

11:18.052 --> 11:21.003
Are you sure this is how
you want to use your only one?

11:22.552 --> 11:25.337
Absolutely.
l've thought this through a lot.

11:25.511 --> 11:27.004
lrrationally, of course.

11:27.677 --> 11:29.134
Okay, if you're sure.

11:29.302 --> 11:32.632
l promise never to come
to this dog park again.

11:32.802 --> 11:36.548
Thank you.
l knew you'd understand.

11:38.678 --> 11:40.418
All right, we're going home.

11:40.593 --> 11:44.338

and l'm late for a deltoid workout.

11:44.510 --> 11:46.216
Well, l guess this is goodbye, Jim.

11:46.385 --> 11:50.249
Yep, by this time next week
l'll be leading my first raft tour in Chile.

11:50.427 --> 11:51.456
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:51.635 --> 11:54.006
- Wow, when do you get back?
- Oh, he's not coming back.

11:54.178 --> 11:55.800
He's moving there.

11:56.552 --> 11:59.301
- Good luck, Jim.
- Yes, you too.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.343
- Take care.
- And stay cool, buddy.

12:01.510 --> 12:03.500
Oh, you know it.

12:10.050 --> 12:12.836
l wonder how l'll use
my irrational demand.

12:15.092 --> 12:19.880
Oh, what's my rush?
l've got years to think it over.

12:37.467 --> 12:41.165
- Hi, Martin.
- Oh, hello, Joanne.

12:41.884 --> 12:45.462
- How have you been?
- Pretty good.

12:45.633 --> 12:48.716
- Oh, please, have a seat.
- Thanks.

12:49.009 --> 12:52.174
l was worried l was going to be late
with all that construction going on.

12:52.343 --> 12:55.174
Yeah, l know. lt's a mess.

12:55.884 --> 12:57.126
How's your hip?

12:57.841 --> 12:59.501
Oh, you learn to live with it.

13:01.508 --> 13:03.415
l think about you a lot, you know.

13:06.092 --> 13:08.580
l've wanted to call, but...

13:09.132 --> 13:10.413
l don't know.

13:10.634 --> 13:13.299
Oh, l understand. lt's okay.

13:15.593 --> 13:22.299
- So, another year has gone by.
- Yeah, time really flies.

13:24.716 --> 13:27.716
l guess it goes a little slower for me.

13:32.008 --> 13:33.715
- How's our roof coming?
- Almost done.

13:33.884 --> 13:35.293
Good.

13:36.841 --> 13:39.509
You know, there was a time
back in high school

13:40.300 --> 13:45.171
when l would have paid a thousand
dollars to watch you eat a Popsicle.

13:51.924 --> 13:54.080
lt was a long time ago.

13:57.133 --> 14:00.046
l think it's kind of funny
that we became friends.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.170
We're friends?

14:02.800 --> 14:06.923
Well, sure we are.
Why wouldn't you think so?

14:07.339 --> 14:11.038
- Oh, dear.
- Nice going, dipstick.

14:11.215 --> 14:13.668
lt's a brand new shirt.

14:15.715 --> 14:17.706
l hear a car. lt's the Smolenskis.

14:17.882 --> 14:19.622
- Okay, keep working.
- Right.

14:19.797 --> 14:22.466
l've got to go to Phillip's room,
spray some air freshener around.

14:22.632 --> 14:27.965
His room reeks of,
l don't know, despair.

14:56.215 --> 15:00.338
lt's even nicer than l remember.

15:00.505 --> 15:01.786
Well, hello there.

15:03.506 --> 15:07.370
Are you having fun
making your little house?

15:10.214 --> 15:14.504
Oh, hi. Oh, there you are.
Hi. Oh, l see you've met Frasier.

15:14.673 --> 15:16.710
You know,
l'm so glad you came today,

15:16.881 --> 15:19.168
because the interest on this place
is really heating up.

15:19.340 --> 15:20.998
Well, we're certainly interested
as well,

15:21.173 --> 15:25.167
but we heard that a lot of homes
in this area have a flooding problem.

15:25.339 --> 15:28.206
Now what do you know
about the basement here?

15:28.880 --> 15:30.374
LANA: Honestly?
SMOLENSKl: Yes.

15:30.548 --> 15:31.791
This house is 60 years old,

15:31.964 --> 15:34.996

flooding once.

[COUGHS]

15:37.964 --> 15:40.120

that the current owner

15:40.297 --> 15:43.497
stores some of his most cherished
keepsakes in that basement.

15:45.963 --> 15:48.251
Are you choking on your lolly?

15:51.963 --> 15:56.834
No. l am choking on something
far more dangerous and destructive

15:57.004 --> 15:59.495
than a simple sugary treat.

16:01.463 --> 16:06.583
lt's a prolific and powerful poison
known as deception.

16:07.255 --> 16:10.038
He's very verbal.

16:14.171 --> 16:17.123
Oh, you know, l just remembered.

16:17.297 --> 16:19.453
Gosh, you know,
the owner did mention something

16:19.630 --> 16:23.541
about a recent
little moisture problem downstairs.

16:23.714 --> 16:26.497
Why don't l give him a call and see
if he'll come down in the price?

16:26.671 --> 16:27.701
Oh, that'd be wonderful.

16:27.878 --> 16:30.747
lf you give us a break in the price,
l'm sure we'll make an offer.

16:30.921 --> 16:33.325

MRS. SMOLENSKl: Thank you, Lana.

Call you tonight.

Bye-bye.

There, now, you see?
You did the right thing.

16:45.545 --> 16:49.326

- l guess not.

16:49.504 --> 16:53.084
Oh, look at our little house.
lt looks great.

16:55.004 --> 16:56.793

we've got a few Popsicle sticks left.

16:56.961 --> 16:59.367
Why don't we add on a half a bath?

17:00.045 --> 17:01.703
Frasier.

17:01.878 --> 17:05.707
You know, Lana, l think the house
should go the other way around,

FRASlER: Doesn't that
feel good to tell the truth?

17:36.294 --> 17:38.331
lt's like breathing a breath
of fresh air after--

what really happened.

in Uncle Frasier's car?

18:05.003 --> 18:10.750
No, you didn't.
