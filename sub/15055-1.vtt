05:15.857 --> 05:17.385
- Si.
- No, no.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.230
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee:

06:11.330 --> 06:13.190
Blessed art thou amongst women,
and blessed is the...

06:22.716 --> 06:24.701
No virgin, me

06:24.801 --> 06:26.411
For I have sinned

06:26.511 --> 06:28.288
I sold my soul

06:28.388 --> 06:30.791
For sex and gin

06:30.891 --> 06:32.709
Go call a priest

06:32.809 --> 06:34.670
All meek and mild

06:34.770 --> 06:36.672
And tell him Mary

06:36.772 --> 06:39.299
Is no more a child

06:42.611 --> 06:44.805
It's raining stones

06:44.905 --> 06:46.974
It's raining bile

06:47.074 --> 06:48.850
From the luxury

06:48.950 --> 06:50.852
Of your denial

06:50.952 --> 06:52.854
I press alarms

06:52.954 --> 06:55.732
Place bets on truth

06:55.832 --> 06:59.403
I'm so up and down

06:59.503 --> 07:04.992
And now I'm growing old disgracefully

07:05.092 --> 07:08.162
Whatever happened to Mary?

07:09.096 --> 07:12.208
Whatever happened to Mary?

07:13.183 --> 07:16.254
Whatever happened to Mary?

07:17.187 --> 07:20.424
Whatever happened to Mary?

07:21.316 --> 07:23.427
Whatever happened to

07:28.281 --> 07:30.350
I'll spit on floors

07:30.450 --> 07:32.352
And do more drugs

07:32.452 --> 07:34.354
Burn every bill

07:34.454 --> 07:36.356
Get drunk on love

07:36.456 --> 07:38.483
Wear next to nothing...

07:38.583 --> 07:41.778
Hey, Frankie, sweetheart! Hey, Frankie!

07:41.878 --> 07:44.114
Let's get out of here.
I got work in the morning. I'm trashed.

07:44.214 --> 07:46.616
Are you too tired to go home with me?

07:46.716 --> 07:48.493
I might be tired, but I'm not dead.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.871
I'll be uncareful

07:50.971 --> 07:52.497
I'll cause such scenes

07:52.597 --> 07:54.583
And I'll never talk

07:54.683 --> 07:56.585
Of used-to-bes

07:56.685 --> 07:58.754
Tattoo my face

07:58.854 --> 08:00.881
I won't go grey

08:00.981 --> 08:02.424
Be a dancing queen

08:02.524 --> 08:05.594
I'm growing old disgracefully

08:05.694 --> 08:08.847
I'm so up and down

08:08.947 --> 08:12.559
And I love what's not allowed

08:12.659 --> 08:14.561
I was lost

08:14.661 --> 08:17.147
Now I see

08:17.247 --> 08:22.903
And now I'm growing old disgracefully.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.423
Oh, hi, Mom.

09:24.523 --> 09:26.800
How do you do that?
How did you know that was me?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.009
Of course it's you.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.220
You have the most persistent
ring I know.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.806
Well, I just wanted to say hi
while I'm near a phone.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.267
- How are you?
- Where are you anyway?

09:35.367 --> 09:36.768
Belo Quinto, near Rio.

09:36.868 --> 09:37.978
- It's beautiful...
- Mom, hold on.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.188
I'm getting another call.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.398
Hello?

09:41.498 --> 09:42.774
It's about time. Where you been, baby?

09:42.874 --> 09:45.610
Ha, ha. I hate it when you just leave.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.112
You could at least say good-bye.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.364
- Why?
- "Why"?

09:49.464 --> 09:50.657
Forget it.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.243
Look, I got my mom on the other line
long distance.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.413
- I'll see you tonight.
- All right, I'll see you later.

09:56.513 --> 10:00.125
Mom? Hi, I'm back.
So how do you like Rio?

10:00.225 --> 10:02.586
It was great. Did you get my package?

10:02.686 --> 10:04.296
Yeah, I got it yesterday.

10:04.396 --> 10:06.006
Well, what did you think?
Did you like it?

10:06.106 --> 10:08.968
- Did you open it yet?
- Hold on, I'm gonna change phones.

10:15.991 --> 10:17.100
Well, what do you think?

10:17.200 --> 10:18.643
Did you get a chance
to look at everything?

10:18.743 --> 10:20.520
- I'm opening it now.
- Uh-huh, and?

10:20.620 --> 10:23.815
- Ooh! Ah, pretty postcards.
- Aren't those pretty?

10:23.915 --> 10:26.193
- Cute brush.
- I saw a lady make that.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.986
- A little hat.
- The ha... isn't that cute?

10:28.086 --> 10:30.405
- It's for a little doll or something.
- A necklace.

10:30.505 --> 10:33.617
Well, no, it's not really a necklace.
It's a rosary.

10:33.717 --> 10:34.826
Where'd you get it?

10:34.926 --> 10:36.453
This little village called Belo Quinto.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.581
- I didn't even know you went there.
- I took a little side trip over here.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.583
So what do you think of the presents?
Do you love 'em?

10:41.683 --> 10:43.668
I'm so glad I got a chance
to talk to you.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.837
I'm going on that cruise.
I'm not gonna talk to you for a month.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.881
- And I have to run.
- Okay, have fun. I love you.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.259
- I love you, too, sweetie, bye-bye.
- I'm glad you called, Mom. Bye.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.280
Can I get two lattes, please? Low-fat.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.533
- Yeah, got it.
- Just one. You know, I'm okay.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.577
Let me get
a bacon and egg sandwich, too.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.246
- To go.
- Coming up.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.789
What's up? You're not eating today?

11:20.889 --> 11:22.874
I threw up this morning
from the smell of tea.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.292
Oh, God.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.544
Late?

11:25.644 --> 11:27.921
- Like, a week.
- A week?

11:28.021 --> 11:30.799
I don't know, a few days.
Kinda feel weird.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.510
You're so dramatic.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.596
I think you're just
psyching yourself out.

11:36.696 --> 11:41.079
I feel like my heart
went to go live in my stomach.

11:41.179 --> 11:43.270
Okay, it's not dramatic.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.355
- What if I'm having a baby?
- With Steven?

11:45.455 --> 11:47.232
What if I'm bringing a person
into this world?

11:47.332 --> 11:49.568
Man, what if? You've got options.

11:49.668 --> 11:50.819
You know what?
I don't want to think about it.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.737
- It's making me cranky.
- Here's your to-go.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.447
You know what,
let's get our tired asses to work...

11:54.547 --> 11:56.408
- Thanks. Hold this.
- ...'cause we are late.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.410
You're always late. There's nothing new.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.514
Father Andrew Kiernan, welcome back.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.891
Cardinal Houseman.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.352
These are interesting. What's the trick?

13:05.452 --> 13:07.896
Well, to be honest, I don't know.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.231
They probably made a fortune out of her.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.817
And, uh, what's... what was this?

13:12.917 --> 13:14.402
Infrared photographs of tears.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.863
The statue is made of stone,
therefore room temperature.

13:16.963 --> 13:19.574
But the tears show up
as white because, um...

13:19.674 --> 13:21.660
because they're warm.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.913
- Warm tears?
- Yes.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.415
My lab report and analysis confirm

13:27.515 --> 13:31.378
that the blood from the statue
is not only warm, but human.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.091
I know what you're thinking.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.885
But with all due respect, Daniel,
this isn't a fake.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.720
It's a freestanding mass of solid stone.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.514
And there is no scientific explanation.

13:42.614 --> 13:45.016
Andrew, it's my understanding
you were sent to Brazil

13:45.116 --> 13:47.602
in order to investigate the appearance
of the Virgin Mary

13:47.702 --> 13:48.895
on the side of a building.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.981
Yes, but while I was in Sao Paulo,
I heard about the statue,

13:52.081 --> 13:53.692
- so I decided to go and investigate.
- And?

13:53.792 --> 13:54.984
And what?

13:55.084 --> 13:56.486
The face of the Virgin Mary
on the building.

13:56.586 --> 14:00.740
It's an oxidation stain
caused by rainwater

14:00.840 --> 14:02.575
running down untreated side walls,

14:02.675 --> 14:05.078
causes an optical illusion
of a veiled woman.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.747
Good.
We'll consider the matter closed, then.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.959
Father Dario has your next assignment.

14:11.059 --> 14:14.671
I was hoping that perhaps
you could send me back to, um...

14:14.771 --> 14:16.297
to Belo Quinto.

14:16.397 --> 14:17.507
Why?

14:17.607 --> 14:20.593
Because I need to do
some more tests on the statue.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.388
You're telling me you left the statue
in Belo Quinto?

14:23.488 --> 14:24.973
Yes.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.641
I was going to take it back, obviously,

14:26.741 --> 14:29.310
but when I saw the effect that it had
on the people... it's amazing.

14:29.410 --> 14:32.939
It's become almost like
a cornerstone of their faith.

14:33.039 --> 14:36.401
Andrew, the cornerstone
of their faith is the Church,

14:36.501 --> 14:38.111
not a crying statue.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.696
When you're in the field,

14:39.796 --> 14:41.823
you're a representative
of the Catholic Church

14:41.923 --> 14:43.992
and the Congregation
of the Causes of the Saints.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.744
Yes, I'm very well aware
of that, Daniel.

14:45.844 --> 14:48.955
I am also a scientist
and I observe the facts.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.667
And the facts are that this statue
has tears of blood.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.795
Well, if that's the case,
you know the policy.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.131
The statue is brought back
to the Vatican.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.924
We conduct expert tests...

15:00.024 --> 15:03.136
geologists, engineers,
medical examiners.

15:03.236 --> 15:07.307
We've examined 50 or 60 crying statues
in the last 12 months.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.808
Not a single one of them
has turned out...

15:08.908 --> 15:11.853
Yes, I'm very well aware of that,
but I just wanted you to know

15:11.953 --> 15:15.774
that in my opinion,
I think that this is different.

15:15.874 --> 15:18.318
I'm not going to allow you
to go back to Brazil.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.112
We'll get a geologist down there,
and if he sees fit,

15:21.212 --> 15:23.531
we'll get the statue sent back
for further tests.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.492
Father Dario, get me
all the information you can

15:25.592 --> 15:27.994
on this church in Belo Quinto,
would you?

15:28.094 --> 15:30.414
Thank you, Andrew.

15:32.015 --> 15:33.625
Thank you.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.303
I have never seen him this way before.

15:45.403 --> 15:48.681
Andrew's problem is he can't decide
if he's a scientist or a priest.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.270
Frankie, come on.

15:54.370 --> 15:57.148
- You are gonna drive yourself crazy.
- No.

15:57.248 --> 15:58.650
If you're worried about being pregnant,

15:58.750 --> 16:01.486
why don't we go to the store
right now and get a test?

16:01.586 --> 16:03.279
Well, let's just give it
a couple of days, okay?

16:03.379 --> 16:04.572
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine.

16:04.672 --> 16:06.115
And stop mothering me. Yes.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.785
All right, girlfriend.
I'll call you later.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.996
Okay, bye. Drive safe.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.607
- Late?
- Like, a week.

16:39.707 --> 16:42.902
You're always late. There's nothing new.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.154
What if I'm bringing
a person into this world?

16:45.254 --> 16:47.324
Frankie, you've got options.

18:54.717 --> 18:57.286
Nurse, somebody needs
to tell me what's going on.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.664
- I don't understand.
- Get out of the way!

18:59.764 --> 19:02.208
Frankie, can you hear me?
I'm right here with you.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.751
Let's go!

19:03.851 --> 19:06.212
I don't understand
why there's so much blood.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.755
- Get me a clamp right now.
- Frankie!

19:07.855 --> 19:10.883
All right, CBC, electrolytes,
UA, tox screen.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.721
Get me a pulse ox, STAT!

19:14.821 --> 19:17.557
- Get me a tox screen and a STAT CT.
- Right away.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.975
Heart rate is irregular.

19:19.075 --> 19:22.186
Blood pressure's off the map.
195 over 120.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.397
- Let's change cuffs.
- Where's the IV?

19:33.047 --> 19:35.658
I'm calling it, code blue!
Get the paddles.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.201
Get some gel. Okay, ready?

19:37.301 --> 19:40.121
- Mark, get the paddle.
- All right, clear!

19:40.221 --> 19:42.623
Temperature and blood pressure
are back to normal.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.252
Who are you?

19:46.352 --> 19:49.422
I'm Dr. Reston.
Do you know what your name is?

19:49.522 --> 19:51.257
What happened? Where am I?

19:51.357 --> 19:52.842
You're in the emergency room.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.011
You were found unconscious
in your apartment.

19:55.111 --> 19:57.263
- Do you remember anything?
- No.

19:57.363 --> 20:00.516
Oh, Jesus.
Can I get some more help over here?

20:00.616 --> 20:03.686
We need some four-by-fours.
We have a very deep laceration here.

20:03.786 --> 20:06.272
Oh, my God, it's gone right through.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.732
Miss, you can't go in there.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.442
- I'm sorry, Doctor, I just need to...
- Please have a seat.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.110
I just need to know
what's going on with her.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.322
She'll be fine.
Please have a seat. Thank you.

20:15.715 --> 20:19.327
These are puncture wounds, Frankie,
caused by the entry of a sharp object.

20:19.427 --> 20:20.953
Are you in any pain?

20:21.053 --> 20:23.873
No. That's weird, isn't it?

20:23.973 --> 20:27.460
Wow, will you look at that?
It only bleeds when I touch it.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.087
Maybe you should not touch it.

20:29.187 --> 20:32.006
Both wounds are identical...
the same size, same shape.

20:32.106 --> 20:35.009
She missed the main artery
by less than a centimeter.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.346
You keep saying "she,"
but I didn't do this.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.432
What's happening in your life, Frankie?

20:41.532 --> 20:43.351
Do you have a lot of stress at work?

20:43.451 --> 20:45.186
I cut hair.

20:45.286 --> 20:48.189
Do you have any trouble
with a significant other?

20:48.289 --> 20:50.608
- Yes.
- And that is?

20:50.708 --> 20:52.652
I'm not very significant.

20:53.878 --> 20:56.072
Look, how long is this gonna take?
I wanna go home.

20:56.172 --> 20:58.741
I think you should stay here
at least 24 hours for observation.

20:58.841 --> 21:01.369
- We need to get a handle on this.
- There's nothing to get a handle on.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.621
Frankie, I'm not gonna kid you...
with wounds like this,

21:03.721 --> 21:06.916
it's pretty obvious
that they were self-inflicted.

21:07.016 --> 21:08.418
You think I did this?

21:09.560 --> 21:12.004
It would never happen.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.800
I love being me. Ask anyone.

21:32.500 --> 21:36.196
Frankie, turn the light off, honey,
and come to bed.

21:44.553 --> 21:47.665
Do you smell flowers
in here or something?

21:48.265 --> 21:50.877
No.

21:50.977 --> 21:54.089
Smells like jasmine
or hyacinth or something.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.592
I don't smell anything.

21:58.985 --> 22:02.471
Mmm. You need anything?

22:02.571 --> 22:04.015
No.

22:05.116 --> 22:08.478
- Good night.
- Good night.

22:32.226 --> 22:34.504
Grazie, signore.

22:37.565 --> 22:38.925
Duty-free.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.596
- Welcome back, Andrew.
- Gianni, come stai?

22:43.696 --> 22:46.724
Sto bene. Ah, God is good.

22:46.824 --> 22:48.726
So how was Belo Quinto?

22:48.826 --> 22:51.646
How do you know about Belo Quinto?
I was sent to Sao Paulo.

22:51.746 --> 22:54.065
God lives here, remember?
We know everything.

22:54.165 --> 22:56.817
- Oh, yes, I forgot.
- So how are you doing?

22:57.617 --> 22:59.528
I don't know.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.739
I don't know.

23:01.839 --> 23:06.535
I travel round the world
investigating miracles.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.120
And then I disprove them.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.581
The real miracle
is anybody believes anything.

23:10.681 --> 23:13.334
I don't know what I'm doing,
to tell you the truth.

23:13.434 --> 23:15.544
None of us know what we are doing.

23:15.644 --> 23:18.172
- So what are you working on?
- I have no idea.

23:18.272 --> 23:21.478
Well, how can you translate something
if you've no idea?

23:21.578 --> 23:23.094
I'm a linguist, Andrew.

23:23.194 --> 23:25.596
I translate words, not their relevance.

23:25.696 --> 23:28.307
But this one is a second century gospel.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.017
How many is that you're up to now?

23:30.117 --> 23:32.895
I've helped translate about 15.

23:32.995 --> 23:35.523
That only leaves 20 still to go.

23:35.623 --> 23:38.985
So there are, what, 35 gospels?

23:39.085 --> 23:41.487
Everyone had a different experience
of Jesus,

23:41.587 --> 23:43.781
so they all wrote different stories.

23:43.881 --> 23:47.118
You see, all the gospels,
they're interpretations.

23:47.218 --> 23:51.330
They're memories, dreams, reflections.

23:51.430 --> 23:55.001
And there's no one gospel
in Jesus' actual words?

23:55.101 --> 23:57.878
We're all blind men in a cave

23:57.978 --> 24:02.174
looking for a candle
that was lit 2,000 years ago.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.968
So what's in this text?

24:04.068 --> 24:07.596
- I was only given every third page.
- Why?

24:07.696 --> 24:12.059
The most sensitive documents are always
divided into threes among us...

24:12.159 --> 24:15.062
one-third to the Dominicans,
one-third to the Franciscans,

24:15.162 --> 24:17.356
and one-third to us Jesuits.

24:17.456 --> 24:22.403
The truth of any document
is only known to a very powerful few.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.906
That's typical of this place, isn't it?

24:26.173 --> 24:29.869
We live in a highly competitive
world, Andrew.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.831
- The Church is no exception.
- Hmm.

24:34.014 --> 24:36.709
Nothing ever gets out of here, does it?

24:36.809 --> 24:39.587
Unless, of course, they want it to.

24:43.107 --> 24:46.761
Both wounds are identical...
same size, same shape.

24:46.861 --> 24:49.263
She missed the main artery
by less than a centimeter.

24:49.363 --> 24:51.098
You think I did this?

24:51.198 --> 24:53.351
What's happening in your life, Frankie?

25:01.167 --> 25:03.110
So, Jen, tell us about your date.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.862
It was with a tax lawyer.

25:04.962 --> 25:07.031
- A tax lawyer?
- Yeah.

25:07.131 --> 25:08.824
But when I first met him,
he seemed really cool.

25:08.924 --> 25:11.494
- Hey.
- Hey, hi, guys.

25:11.594 --> 25:12.787
- Hey, Frankie.
- How you feeling?

25:12.887 --> 25:14.331
Fine.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.460
Really okay or just okay?

25:19.560 --> 25:21.379
I'm fine.

25:21.479 --> 25:22.713
So how's my day looking?

25:22.813 --> 25:25.633
Well, I started your first client,
and you're booked solid until 7:00.

25:25.733 --> 25:27.093
Thanks.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.386
Wanna come over here?

25:28.486 --> 25:30.304
Okay, well, go back to Jen
and dish the dirt.

25:32.990 --> 25:36.102
So, uh, he seemed pretty cool.

25:36.202 --> 25:39.105
Divorced, but no kids.

25:39.205 --> 25:42.566
But he left the table
in the middle of dinner

25:42.666 --> 25:44.777
to call his mother in Oregon.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.238
Major points for the long-distance mom.

25:47.338 --> 25:50.866
Yeah. You know,
I thought I'd give him a shot.

25:50.966 --> 25:53.452
But you won't believe what he did.

25:53.552 --> 25:57.289
Every single time he took
a bite of his steak...

25:57.389 --> 25:58.791
he growled.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.251
He growled!

26:55.030 --> 26:56.307
Shit!

26:56.407 --> 26:58.184
Stop! There's a baby!

26:58.978 --> 27:00.519
Frankie!

27:00.619 --> 27:02.688
- Stop! Wait!
- Hey, lady!

27:02.788 --> 27:06.108
- There's a baby! Stop!
- Crazy bitch!

27:06.208 --> 27:07.610
Frankie, what are you doing?!

27:07.710 --> 27:09.487
- What's your problem?
- You crazy or what?

27:11.672 --> 27:13.991
Where's the baby?

27:14.091 --> 27:15.910
- Frankie!
- Watch it, lady!

27:16.010 --> 27:17.746
- Frankie!
- Where's the lady? Did you see her?

27:19.096 --> 27:20.831
- Frankie.
- She dropped her baby!

27:20.931 --> 27:24.001
- Frankie, there's no baby, honey.
- Jeez.

27:24.101 --> 27:26.170
There's no baby and there's no lady.

27:26.270 --> 27:28.672
- What's happening?
- No, honey, it's...

27:29.579 --> 27:31.425
It's okay, honey.

27:31.913 --> 27:33.844
Take the night off, okay?

27:33.944 --> 27:36.472
There was a lady. I saw her!

27:36.572 --> 27:38.849
- There was not a lady.
- She dropped her baby.

27:38.949 --> 27:41.936
I swear. I swear.

27:42.036 --> 27:44.272
I just wanna get you home, okay?

27:56.050 --> 27:57.660
You all right?

27:59.470 --> 28:01.164
We'll be home in a minute.

28:48.519 --> 28:50.129
- Frankie...
- Hey, you!

28:50.229 --> 28:53.257
- Are you speaking to me?
- Are you Andrew Kiernan?

28:53.357 --> 28:56.511
Andrew Kiernan?
No. My name's Father Durning.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.016
May I help you?

29:02.116 --> 29:05.103
No one can help me now. I'm fucked.

30:31.789 --> 30:34.108
All passengers, please exit the train.

30:34.208 --> 30:36.610
Wait on the platform for assistance.

30:36.710 --> 30:37.946
Somebody help!

30:59.900 --> 31:02.678
- Ah!
- Frankie Paige?

31:02.778 --> 31:07.182
We're gonna schedule some more tests
for this afternoon around 4:00.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.351
Did you run a pregnancy test?

31:09.451 --> 31:11.562
Um... yes.

31:11.662 --> 31:13.314
Am I pregnant?

31:14.414 --> 31:15.774
No.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.736
- Was I?
- I don't know.

31:43.402 --> 31:46.430
Take this, all of you,
and drink from it,

31:46.530 --> 31:48.807
for this is the cup of my blood,

31:48.907 --> 31:52.770
shed for you and for all men
so that sins may be forgiven.

31:52.870 --> 31:55.189
Do this in memory of me.

31:56.957 --> 31:58.568
This is the blood of Christ.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.367
This is the blood of Christ.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.418
This is the blood of Christ.

32:39.082 --> 32:43.119
Well, am I psychotic or dying or both?

32:43.219 --> 32:45.197
Well, none of the above.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.741
Actually, I think that
you're quite rational,

32:47.841 --> 32:52.037
and despite the wounds you suffered,
you're in very good health.

32:52.137 --> 32:55.874
There is another possibility
that is of concern.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.210
Epilepsy.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.170
Epilepsy?

33:00.270 --> 33:02.714
We've run some preliminary tests,

33:02.814 --> 33:06.385
and all things considered,
I think it might explain a lot.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.888
But that seems impossible.

33:09.947 --> 33:12.808
How can you just wake up one day
and have that?

33:12.908 --> 33:16.937
Well, you can't, but, uh, you've
described blunt trauma to the head,

33:17.037 --> 33:18.981
disturbing hallucinations.

33:19.081 --> 33:22.317
You're hearing voices.
These could all indicate epilepsy.

33:22.417 --> 33:23.902
So what do we do now?

33:24.002 --> 33:28.991
We're going to insert some electrodes
into the upper neocortex.

33:29.091 --> 33:30.868
Wait a minute, wait.

33:30.968 --> 33:33.704
You want to put wires inside my head?

33:33.804 --> 33:38.625
Frankie, we're gonna do whatever we can
to find out what's causing this.

33:38.725 --> 33:40.336
You hang in there.

33:56.994 --> 33:59.855
Epilepsy? They don't know
what they're talking about, Frankie.

33:59.955 --> 34:01.565
I think you should get a second opinion.

34:01.665 --> 34:04.401
Miss Paige? I'm Father Durning.

34:04.501 --> 34:06.445
You spoke to me on the train?

34:06.545 --> 34:08.071
Oh. Yeah?

34:08.170 --> 34:10.072
I'd like to talk to you
about what happened.

34:10.172 --> 34:11.283
Why?

34:11.382 --> 34:13.327
Do you know what the stigmata are?

34:13.427 --> 34:16.955
Uh, Father, I gotta
get Frankie home, thanks.

34:17.054 --> 34:21.083
I understand how you feel, but please
call me if you change your mind.

34:21.184 --> 34:22.545
Okay.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.717
Ah, Andrew, come in.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.929
I think we've found
your next assignment.

34:32.029 --> 34:33.931
I was hoping that perhaps
you'd changed your mind

34:34.031 --> 34:35.681
about sending me to Belo Quinto.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.768
We have no record
of a church in Belo Quinto.

34:38.869 --> 34:40.938
What?

34:41.038 --> 34:43.190
That's impossible.
There must be some mistake.

34:43.290 --> 34:46.568
No mistake, Father.
I have checked into it myself.

34:46.668 --> 34:50.072
If there is a church in Belo Quinto,
it is not one of ours.

34:50.172 --> 34:53.324
And no record of a priest
assigned to that village either.

34:53.425 --> 34:56.203
This was sent to us
by a Father Durning in Pittsburgh

34:56.303 --> 34:58.163
from the train's security camera.

34:58.263 --> 35:01.583
What, uh... what are we supposed
to be looking for?

35:01.683 --> 35:03.044
Watch.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.380
Stop.

35:08.648 --> 35:11.093
Obviously it is some sort of attack.

35:11.193 --> 35:13.053
Maybe possession.

35:13.153 --> 35:14.638
The wrists are bandaged.

35:14.738 --> 35:16.306
According to Father Durning,

35:16.406 --> 35:20.727
she was whipped repeatedly
by an unseen force.

35:20.827 --> 35:23.438
How important is this really, Daniel?

35:23.538 --> 35:25.732
We don't know yet.

35:25.832 --> 35:27.317
Then why are you sending me?

35:27.417 --> 35:30.613
Because of this clipping
from the "Pittsburgh Globe."

35:32.422 --> 35:35.450
"20 terrified witnesses,
unexplained wounds,

35:35.550 --> 35:37.285
Catholic priest."

35:37.385 --> 35:38.787
The publicity is unfortunate,

35:38.887 --> 35:41.957
but I'm sure by the time I get there,
it'll be completely blown over.

35:42.057 --> 35:44.168
We're investigating this one.

36:05.372 --> 36:06.690
You know what I heard?

36:06.790 --> 36:09.318
Catholic priest in the paper said
that it was some like...

36:11.378 --> 36:14.072
- Hey, Frankie!
- Hey, Frankie.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.533
- Hey, Frankie.
- Hey, Frankie.

36:16.633 --> 36:19.161
Hey, I feel like I should do
a monologue or something.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.289
Hey, Cheryl.

36:22.389 --> 36:25.208
Come on over here and have a seat.
I'll just be a second.

36:25.308 --> 36:28.838
Um, you know what?
I think I'm just gonna wait for Donna.

36:29.813 --> 36:32.008
Oh. Okay.

36:38.780 --> 36:43.060
- What's going on with her?
- She wants to get a second opinion.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.437
They think she might have epilepsy.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.939
Epilepsy? She doesn't look too good.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.152
Why is she even at work?

36:52.252 --> 36:56.365
Hey, would you guys stop whispering
like this was a goddamn church?

37:02.650 --> 37:04.539
- Hi.
- Hello.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.374
You have an appointment or...?

37:06.474 --> 37:08.418
No, I... I don't.

37:08.518 --> 37:11.588
Well, would you like a haircut,
a manicure,

37:11.688 --> 37:14.216
or maybe you'd like
to have your nipples pierced?

37:16.151 --> 37:18.011
Well, maybe if we just start
with a trim,

37:18.111 --> 37:20.305
we could go from there?

37:21.241 --> 37:22.892
- Thank you.
- Come on. Have a seat.

37:26.328 --> 37:27.437
All right, here we go.

37:27.537 --> 37:30.107
I'm gonna put this cape on
so you don't get a scratchy neck.

37:30.207 --> 37:31.692
Ah, thank you.

37:33.877 --> 37:35.445
So where are you from?

37:35.545 --> 37:37.197
I live in Rome, actually.

37:37.297 --> 37:38.949
Ooh, cool.

37:39.049 --> 37:41.868
- And you?
- I'm from Naples.

37:41.968 --> 37:44.121
- Ah, Naples.
- Mm-hmm.

37:44.221 --> 37:47.207
Naples, la citta piu bella del mondo.

37:47.307 --> 37:49.668
Naples, Florida.

37:49.768 --> 37:53.046
- I moved here to go to school.
- Which school?

37:53.146 --> 37:56.633
Claudia's University of Cosmetology.

37:56.733 --> 38:00.429
- See? I'm accredited.
- Oh. Cool.

38:01.363 --> 38:04.891
Am I going crazy
or is Frankie hitting on a priest?

38:04.991 --> 38:06.143
What do I call you?

38:06.243 --> 38:08.937
I feel kind of weird calling a guy
I could date "Father."

38:11.081 --> 38:13.775
I mean, I couldn't date you,
but... you know.

38:13.875 --> 38:16.469
Oh, no, no, no. You just made my day.

38:16.569 --> 38:19.739
Thank you. You can call me Andrew.

38:19.839 --> 38:22.284
Andrew Kiernan, that's my name.

38:26.923 --> 38:28.940
Donna.

38:34.521 --> 38:38.383
I know this is gonna sound
kinda strange, but...

38:38.483 --> 38:40.302
I've sorta been expecting you.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.311
So you live in Rome?

38:49.411 --> 38:52.063
Yes, but I travel a great deal,
so I'm rarely there.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.607
- Thank you.
- Coffee, honey?

38:53.707 --> 38:56.651
No, thanks.
So what brings you to Pennsylvania?

38:56.751 --> 38:59.446
Well, Father Durning asked us
to come and speak to you, Miss Paige.

38:59.546 --> 39:02.365
Us? Who's us?
I thought you were a priest.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.576
Well, I am a priest,
but I'm also an investigator.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.328
I work for a division in the Vatican

39:06.428 --> 39:10.415
called the Congregation
for the Causes of the Saints.

39:10.515 --> 39:12.500
Do you mind if I switch this on?

39:12.600 --> 39:14.586
- No, go ahead.
- Thank you.

39:14.686 --> 39:17.005
What is... what is your full name?

39:17.105 --> 39:19.424
Frankie Paige.

39:19.524 --> 39:22.010
- And your age?
- 23.

39:22.110 --> 39:24.262
And which church do you attend?

39:24.362 --> 39:26.098
I don't attend church.

39:27.115 --> 39:28.225
But you are Catholic.

39:28.325 --> 39:30.603
No, I don't go to church
because I don't believe in God.

39:35.332 --> 39:38.693
Well, that's... gonna be it for me.

39:38.793 --> 39:41.029
That's all I need to know, Miss Paige.

39:41.129 --> 39:43.865
- That's it?
- Yes.

39:43.965 --> 39:48.036
You see, stigmatics
are deeply religious people.

39:48.136 --> 39:50.872
- And there's no exceptions?
- No.

39:50.972 --> 39:52.791
Well, why do they get stigmata?

39:52.891 --> 39:58.004
When Christ died on the cross, he...
he died with five wounds.

39:58.104 --> 40:00.215
His back was scourged by whips.

40:00.315 --> 40:04.094
There were gashes in his forehead
from a crown of thorns.

40:04.194 --> 40:07.389
There were nails driven
through his hands and feet.

40:09.991 --> 40:13.812
And finally, a spear
driven through his side.

40:15.121 --> 40:19.776
Throughout history,
only deeply devout people

40:19.876 --> 40:22.862
have been afflicted with these wounds.

40:22.962 --> 40:24.572
Well, why?

40:24.672 --> 40:27.367
There really is no satisfactory
scientific explanation.

40:27.467 --> 40:31.621
All stigmatics are haunted
by such intense spiritual pain,

40:31.721 --> 40:33.915
in some ways it affects them physically.

40:34.015 --> 40:36.293
They're assaulted
by their own visions of evil,

40:36.393 --> 40:39.129
and they manifest this battle
in their bodies.

40:39.229 --> 40:42.465
The Church, on the other hand,
regards it as a gift,

40:42.565 --> 40:44.009
a gift from God.

40:44.820 --> 40:47.341
A gift? Can I give it back?

40:51.616 --> 40:53.476
Listen, Father...

40:53.576 --> 40:57.439
ahem, can I show you these,
and you could tell me what you think?

40:57.539 --> 40:59.525
Yes. Yes, of course.

41:30.238 --> 41:31.724
Coffee, honey?

41:34.050 --> 41:35.518
Well, what do you think?

41:35.618 --> 41:38.104
Well, it doesn't really matter
what I think, Miss Paige.

41:38.204 --> 41:39.481
What does that mean?

41:39.581 --> 41:42.359
It means officially,
this is not a case for the Church.

41:42.459 --> 41:47.113
To say that a self-confessed atheist
exhibits the wounds of Christ

41:47.213 --> 41:48.406
is a contradiction in terms.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.701
Look, you know what? Here. Read that.

41:51.801 --> 41:53.787
I found that on my kitchen table
the other morning.

41:53.887 --> 41:57.290
Now, I don't know what that says,
but that handwriting is mine.

41:57.390 --> 41:59.000
It's Italian.

41:59.100 --> 42:03.838
It says, "Split a piece of wood,
and I'm there.

42:03.938 --> 42:06.716
Lift a stone, and you will find me."

42:06.816 --> 42:09.344
It's quite beautiful, actually.

42:09.444 --> 42:12.055
This isn't beautiful. This is a warning!

42:12.155 --> 42:13.807
- It means no matter what I do...
- Miss Paige!

42:13.907 --> 42:16.101
...no matter where I go,
I can't escape this.

42:16.201 --> 42:18.978
Miss Paige,
I would really like to help you...

42:19.078 --> 42:20.939
You know what? You know what?
This is not going anywhere.

42:21.039 --> 42:23.608
You don't know what this is.
You can't give me any kind of answer.

42:23.708 --> 42:25.611
Coffee's on me. Here.

42:56.366 --> 42:59.937
There really is no satisfactory
scientific explanation.

43:04.290 --> 43:06.652
Stigmatics are deeply religious people.

43:08.253 --> 43:11.573
We're gonna do whatever
we can to find out,

43:11.673 --> 43:15.285
but, all things considered,
I think it might explain a lot.

43:15.385 --> 43:19.497
Throughout history, only people
who believe deeply in God

43:19.597 --> 43:21.499
have been afflicted with these wounds.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.501
The nearer they come to God,

43:23.601 --> 43:26.547
the more open they are
to the torment of their demons.

43:27.855 --> 43:31.677
The Church regards it as a gift,
a gift from God.

43:40.702 --> 43:42.729
Whoo-hoo!

43:42.829 --> 43:46.442
- Here's to Friday night!
- Yeah, Friday night, honey.

43:50.503 --> 43:51.739
Frankie!

43:54.340 --> 43:56.117
Don't worry about it.
Just order another drink.

43:56.217 --> 43:58.369
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go check it out.

43:58.469 --> 44:00.163
But you just can't tell

44:00.263 --> 44:03.333
Don't hold your breath, but the pretty
things are going to hell...

44:03.433 --> 44:05.460
- Hey, girlfriend. What's up?
- Hey.

44:05.560 --> 44:07.170
I thought you were staying home
to get some rest.

44:07.270 --> 44:08.463
Have you seen Steven?

44:08.563 --> 44:11.633
Man, forget about Steven.
What's up with that priest?

44:11.733 --> 44:16.304
Believe me, he's all business.
Hey, can we get two doubles each?

44:16.404 --> 44:18.932
Hey, you know what's scarier
than not believing in God?

44:19.032 --> 44:20.433
Believing in Him.

44:20.533 --> 44:23.269
I mean, really believing in Him
is a fucking terrifying thought.

44:23.369 --> 44:24.479
It's Friday night.

44:24.579 --> 44:27.232
I think you're taking things
a little too seriously.

44:27.332 --> 44:29.150
'Cause If there is a God,
then He hates me

44:29.250 --> 44:30.610
'cause He's ruining my life.

44:30.710 --> 44:32.529
Come on, Frankie,
it's gonna be all right, man.

44:32.629 --> 44:34.739
- Relax.
- You don't get it, do you?

44:34.839 --> 44:37.617
I have fucking holes through my wrists!

44:37.717 --> 44:39.619
I have slashes across my back!

44:39.719 --> 44:44.207
If it isn't God that's doing this to me,
then who is?

44:44.307 --> 44:46.543
I think you're losing it, man.

44:49.354 --> 44:51.214
Where you goin'?

44:52.807 --> 44:54.092
Frankie!

45:03.660 --> 45:06.437
Frankie! Oh, God!

45:06.537 --> 45:08.773
Frankie, get up! Get up!

45:09.597 --> 45:10.984
Frankie...

45:11.084 --> 45:13.487
Frankie, it's all right. Frankie!

45:19.801 --> 45:22.912
Don't just fuckin' stand there!
Somebody call an ambulance!

45:23.012 --> 45:24.122
Damn.

45:36.109 --> 45:37.845
Frankie, where are you?

45:51.492 --> 45:52.734
Get outta there!

46:18.860 --> 46:20.053
Miss Paige?

46:25.241 --> 46:26.727
Miss Paige!

46:38.546 --> 46:40.115
Miss Paige?

46:42.508 --> 46:44.452
Miss Paige!

47:31.724 --> 47:33.293
Miss Paige?

47:37.980 --> 47:39.341
Miss Paige!

47:52.787 --> 47:54.439
Miss Paige?

48:21.816 --> 48:23.135
Frankie!

48:37.039 --> 48:39.734
- Let's get you out of here.
- Frankie.

48:39.834 --> 48:42.361
We need to get her to a safe place.

48:42.461 --> 48:45.532
Here, I got you. I got you.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.527
Welcome back.

49:22.627 --> 49:24.195
Where am I?

49:24.295 --> 49:26.448
You're in Father Durning's church.

49:29.050 --> 49:30.785
Hey.

49:30.885 --> 49:32.954
I think she should get some rest.

49:34.597 --> 49:36.708
You all right?

49:39.685 --> 49:42.630
You look like shit.

49:42.730 --> 49:44.883
It smells like...

49:46.108 --> 49:48.135
flowers.

49:48.235 --> 49:50.889
You got stuff all in your hair.

50:14.011 --> 50:15.329
Pronto.

50:15.429 --> 50:18.332
- Gianni, come stai?
- Andrew, how are you?

50:18.432 --> 50:20.960
Gianni, listen, could you help me
with a translation?

50:21.060 --> 50:23.629
- Si. Do you have it there?
- Yes, I have it here.

50:23.729 --> 50:25.674
- Read it to me.
- I'll play it for you now.

50:35.700 --> 50:37.560
Thama...

50:37.660 --> 50:39.937
Well, what is it? Is it gibberish?

50:40.037 --> 50:42.148
No, no, no, it's not gibberish at all.

50:42.248 --> 50:44.234
Andrew, who is speaking these words?

51:54.028 --> 51:56.097
Good morning, Miss Paige.
You're up early.

51:56.197 --> 51:58.182
Hey. I think you made a mistake.

51:58.282 --> 52:00.810
- What do you mean?
- I can't have stigmata.

52:00.910 --> 52:04.230
Jesus was crucified through
the palms of his hands, not his wrists.

52:04.330 --> 52:06.273
And look at my wounds.
They're through the wrists.

52:06.373 --> 52:07.566
So you're wrong.

52:07.666 --> 52:11.362
Actually, scientists have discovered
that in Roman times,

52:11.462 --> 52:15.574
people were crucified
through the wrists, not the palms.

52:15.674 --> 52:18.119
There's no way that the hands
could have supported the weight of body,

52:18.219 --> 52:21.998
so they did crucify them
through the wrists.

52:22.098 --> 52:25.626
No, wait, you're telling me
that every painting,

52:25.726 --> 52:29.171
every statue of Christ,
every single crucifix

52:29.271 --> 52:31.716
in the whole world is wrong?

52:31.816 --> 52:34.468
No, no, just inaccurate.

52:34.568 --> 52:36.595
They're impressions of the truth.

52:36.695 --> 52:39.473
Icons are meant to be inspirational.

52:39.573 --> 52:43.644
Miss Paige, there's something else
you should know.

52:43.744 --> 52:47.398
The words you keep repeating
that, uh, you thought were nonsense...

52:47.498 --> 52:49.734
well, it's not.

52:49.834 --> 52:52.153
It's actually a very specific language.

52:52.253 --> 52:54.280
It's a form of Aramaic.

52:54.380 --> 52:55.781
What?

52:55.881 --> 52:59.118
It's a form of Aramaic
that hasn't been used for 1,900 years.

52:59.218 --> 53:02.664
It's a dialect that was used in Galilee
around the time of Jesus.

53:43.971 --> 53:47.374
"Split a piece of wood and I am there.

53:47.474 --> 53:50.337
Lift a stone and you will find me."

54:45.241 --> 54:47.852
- Did you get through?
- No.

54:47.952 --> 54:49.854
Her machine didn't even pick up.

55:14.822 --> 55:16.943
Miss Paige?

55:17.738 --> 55:19.643
Miss Paige?

55:50.681 --> 55:52.416
Frankie?

55:59.982 --> 56:01.384
Frankie?

56:15.831 --> 56:17.650
Frankie...

56:22.212 --> 56:23.740
Frankie.

56:27.009 --> 56:28.745
Who are you?

58:21.415 --> 58:24.777
I feel like my heart is breaking.

58:27.880 --> 58:30.617
Why am I so sad?

58:37.806 --> 58:40.877
It smells like flowers in here.

58:42.936 --> 58:44.671
Like...

58:44.771 --> 58:46.924
jasmine or...

58:47.941 --> 58:50.636
rose or something.

58:50.736 --> 58:53.640
- Can you smell that?
- Yes, I can.

58:57.242 --> 58:59.812
- Who wrote that?
- You did.

58:59.912 --> 59:03.107
- I wrote that?
- Yes.

59:16.678 --> 59:18.038
Have you heard from Father Andrew?

59:18.138 --> 59:19.248
No, Eminence.

59:19.348 --> 59:21.542
He hasn't filed a report
since he got there.

59:21.642 --> 59:22.751
What are these?

59:22.851 --> 59:25.504
These are newspaper clippings
from our office in New York.

59:25.604 --> 59:28.048
The first one is from Pennsylvania.

59:28.148 --> 59:31.385
The others are from New York
and Washington.

59:31.485 --> 59:35.556
These are even more damaging.
This one mentions the stigmata.

59:35.656 --> 59:38.183
He doesn't seem to be
defusing the situation.

59:38.283 --> 59:39.810
Shall I call him home?

59:39.910 --> 59:42.438
Have him conclude
his investigation immediately,

59:42.538 --> 59:45.065
present his report to me
in New York at the end of next week.

59:49.711 --> 59:53.615
Frankie, can you please come over here
and have a look at this?

59:53.715 --> 59:56.827
I... I just can't believe that
none of this means anything to you.

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:02.500
Frankie?

01:00:06.575 --> 01:00:08.089
Frankie.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.719
Frankie, can you please?

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:17.682
Can you please look at this?

01:00:18.907 --> 01:00:21.935
Sometimes subjects retain
fragments or images

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:24.771
that can be transmitted
subconsciously and...

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:28.775
This subject doesn't retain
fragments of images.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:31.278
You don't get it,
do you, Father Kiernan?

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:33.655
I don't know what the hell that means!

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:37.868
I don't know what the hell this means.
I just want my life back, okay?

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:49.087
I'm sitting amongst yourselves

01:00:49.187 --> 01:00:53.884
Don't think you can see me

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:58.472
I haven't gone anywhere

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:02.143
But out of my body

01:01:03.619 --> 01:01:08.273
Reach out and touch me

01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:13.111
Make effort to speak to me

01:01:13.211 --> 01:01:17.866
Call out and you'll hear me

01:01:17.966 --> 01:01:22.663
Be happy for me...

01:01:22.763 --> 01:01:23.997
Miss Paige?

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:27.417
Miss Paige, I, uh... I'm sorry.

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:30.963
Don't "Miss Paige" me
just because you messed up.

01:01:31.063 --> 01:01:33.048
I'm not gonna let you off the hook.

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:36.593
Okay, but, uh... I am sorry.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:39.805
You know, for a priest,
you're pretty relentless.

01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:44.351
Yeah, I guess I stopped being a priest
and slipped back into being a scientist.

01:01:44.451 --> 01:01:46.562
It, uh... it happens.

01:01:46.662 --> 01:01:49.773
Hey, what kind of a scientist
is a priest, anyway?

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:51.817
You don't want to know.

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:54.611
Oh, yes, I do.

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:56.738
You were an organic chemist?

01:01:56.838 --> 01:01:59.408
Okay, did you walk around
with those glasses

01:01:59.508 --> 01:02:03.328
with Scotch tape around the sides
and pocket protectors?

01:02:04.866 --> 01:02:06.290
I did, actually.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:10.210
Anyway, one day, I just decided
that I was going to become a priest.

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:11.420
Well, why?

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.547
- The holes.
- The holes?

01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:16.341
- Mm, the holes in the theories.
- What theories?

01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:18.969
The world is six billion years old,
right?

01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:21.263
There's been life on this planet
for three billion years,

01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:23.974
but for three billion years before that,
there was nothing.

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:27.436
No life. Just a bunch of elements
swirling around.

01:02:27.536 --> 01:02:30.814
And then one day,
for no apparent reason whatsoever,

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:33.400
all these elements
came together in perfect harmony,

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:36.028
and there was suddenly life,

01:02:36.128 --> 01:02:39.823
living things like lilac and...
and hedgehogs and snails...

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:43.285
- Beer and cheesecake.
- Beer and cheesecake.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:45.287
Did you know that monks
invented alcohol?

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:47.581
- Yeah. Everybody knows that.
- You knew that?

01:02:47.681 --> 01:02:49.207
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

01:02:49.307 --> 01:02:51.501
Well, anyway, to get back
to the big hole.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.086
There really...

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:55.797
There really isn't any explanation.

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:59.968
And I figured that there was
something more than...

01:03:00.068 --> 01:03:02.638
well, more important
than organic chemistry going on,

01:03:02.738 --> 01:03:05.223
and I figured that it was God

01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:08.810
and that God was responsible
for all this life.

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:12.397
- I really can't get a line on you.
- Why not?

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:14.858
First of all, I can't understand
a man who's never, you know.

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:16.610
Never made love to a woman?

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:20.364
Well, ahem, this may come
as a great surprise to you,

01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:24.034
but... I wasn't born a priest.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:27.746
- But you didn't like it?
- Well, what's not to like?

01:03:27.846 --> 01:03:30.457
- But you don't miss it?
- Yes, of course I miss it.

01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:32.834
I mean, I'm human, you know?

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:36.963
I struggle with it,
but I've made a choice.

01:03:37.063 --> 01:03:38.882
Basically, what I've done
is I've exchanged

01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:42.136
one set of complications for another.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.967
Frankie.

01:04:42.444 --> 01:04:43.948
Frankie...

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:56.960
So this is the fourth?

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:59.463
- What do you mean?
- When I first met you,

01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:02.632
didn't you say that
there were five wounds?

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:05.051
Well, this is the fourth.

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:06.929
What's the fifth?

01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:09.849
The spear.

01:05:11.199 --> 01:05:13.059
That's the wound that killed him.

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:15.103
Don't worry, Frankie.

01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:18.774
No stigmatic has ever received
the full five wounds.

01:05:18.874 --> 01:05:22.319
Have you ever met another person
who had stigmata?

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:24.780
I did make a pilgrimage
to a small village

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:27.324
in the mountains of Southern Italy.

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:30.410
There I met a priest called Padre Pio.

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:34.080
He first received the wounds
when he was 23 years of age,

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:36.416
the same age as Saint Francis of Assisi.

01:05:36.516 --> 01:05:38.335
Who's Saint Francis of Assisi?

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:41.713
Saint Francis was the first person
to receive the stigmata,

01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:44.299
in the 13th century.

01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:48.053
He was a wild young man,
but he suddenly changed his ways

01:05:48.153 --> 01:05:51.431
after he'd had a vision
of being crucified alongside Christ.

01:05:51.531 --> 01:05:53.517
When he woke up,

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:56.896
his hands and his feet were...
were bleeding.

01:05:58.079 --> 01:06:00.607
This priest, were his wounds
as bad as mine?

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:02.108
Padre Pio.

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:04.361
Sometimes he lost a pint of blood a day

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:07.072
and he suffered
terrible demonic attacks.

01:06:07.172 --> 01:06:08.281
A priest?

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:12.994
All stigmatics suffer
the most intense spiritual conflict.

01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:14.955
The nearer they come to God,

01:06:15.055 --> 01:06:18.542
the more open they are to temptation,
to evil visions...

01:06:20.018 --> 01:06:22.045
to the torment of their demons.

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:25.674
There was also a smell
which accompanied the wounds,

01:06:25.774 --> 01:06:27.551
the odor of sanctity, the smell of...

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:29.010
Flowers.

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:31.931
Yes, flowers.

01:06:33.865 --> 01:06:36.059
Well, what happened to him?

01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:37.978
How many wounds did he receive?

01:06:38.078 --> 01:06:40.522
He...

01:06:41.057 --> 01:06:43.191
He lived to old age.

01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:45.861
How many wounds did he receive?

01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:51.367
Two.

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:00.042
I'm dying, aren't I?

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:04.922
This thing is killing me.

01:07:28.712 --> 01:07:30.447
Here's a closer shot.

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:32.616
My guess is it's probably Aramaic.

01:07:32.716 --> 01:07:35.494
Aspetta. I'm looking at it.

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:40.123
Is there a...
is there a problem, Gianni?

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:42.459
Yes, don't send me any more
of these pictures.

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:44.961
- How many did you send?
- Six. Why?

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:47.797
- The problem is what it says.
- Well, what does it say?

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:52.344
It says, "The kingdom of God
is inside you

01:07:52.444 --> 01:07:54.095
and all about you."

01:07:54.195 --> 01:07:56.973
Andrew, forget you saw this.
Drop it immediately.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:59.100
- Don't send me any more...
- Gianni, what is the problem?

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.602
Do you remember the Gospels...

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:05.231
Gianni?

01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:07.984
Gianni, are you still there? Gianni?

01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:09.736
Do you remember the Gospels Commission?

01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:13.239
It was closed down suddenly
by your friend Cardinal Houseman.

01:08:13.339 --> 01:08:15.241
Yes, a few years ago, yes.

01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:18.912
We discovered a document that looked
like it was a completely new gospel.

01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:20.997
Well, what's the significance of that?

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:24.042
I was one of the three translators
of this gospel.

01:08:24.142 --> 01:08:26.627
It was written entirely in Aramaic,

01:08:26.728 --> 01:08:30.090
the language of Jesus and his disciples.

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:33.594
It may be Jesus' actual words.
His own...

01:08:34.511 --> 01:08:35.908
Where is it now?

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:40.809
Gianni? What's going on?

01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:43.687
Gianni, are you there? Gianni?

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:49.902
Buona sera.

01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:55.908
What's this?

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:03.622
- Is that a painting?
- No, it's a mirror.

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:04.957
Well, who else was in the room?

01:09:05.058 --> 01:09:06.501
I don't know.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.337
I thought you said it was just you two.

01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:11.423
16-A. Do you have the neg?

01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:14.926
Who is that?

01:09:21.198 --> 01:09:23.102
I'll be back as soon as I can.

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:51.296
- Cardinal Houseman.
- I'm late for a meeting with a courier.

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:54.049
At your discretion,
but I think this might be of interest.

01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:55.384
What is it?

01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:01.765
Where did you get this?

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:04.309
It was emailed to Father Delmonico.

01:10:04.409 --> 01:10:07.146
- By whom?
- Father Kiernan in Pittsburgh.

01:10:08.496 --> 01:10:10.774
- Do you know what it means?
- No.

01:10:10.874 --> 01:10:12.817
Is it important?

01:10:12.917 --> 01:10:15.696
Uh, will you tell the meeting
I'll be with them in a few minutes?

01:10:26.181 --> 01:10:27.457
Who is it?

01:11:09.733 --> 01:11:12.279
Hi, come in. The door's open.

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:22.095
- Frankie?
- I'm in here!

01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:23.888
Raise me to your lips

01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:26.766
Two undernourished egos,
four rotating hips

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:29.102
Hold on to me tightly,
I'm a sliding scale...

01:11:29.202 --> 01:11:32.355
How you doin'? Want a beer?

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:33.816
Sure.

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:41.156
Check these out.
Looks like they're getting better.

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:44.450
- That's great.
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:46.202
Really good.

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:48.372
You'll be able to get
these stitches out soon.

01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:52.292
That's great. Let me see your forehead.

01:11:53.685 --> 01:11:56.171
Mm-hmm. Right.

01:11:56.271 --> 01:11:59.382
- Does this... does this hurt?
- It's good.

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:01.551
Right, you'll...

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:04.470
Between us is our kitchen

01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:07.348
Where she found my irritants itching

01:12:07.448 --> 01:12:10.018
Been here before

01:12:10.118 --> 01:12:12.896
Been here forever

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:17.150
Moving up slowly, inertia keeps

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:19.986
Moving up slowly, inertia creeps

01:12:20.086 --> 01:12:22.906
Moving up slowly, inertia keeps

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:26.910
Moving up slowly,
she comes moving up slowly...

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:28.870
Why did you paint over the wall?

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:32.665
Well, I got bored and I got sick
of looking at that thing.

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:36.336
Inertia creeps, moving up slowly...

01:12:47.113 --> 01:12:50.099
There be no sound in my eiderdown

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:53.019
Awake I lie in the morning's bloom

01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:56.231
Hold me still, my antenna in you

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:01.527
Nylon burns the bedspread with two

01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:04.239
Gravity zero, see me stall

01:13:04.339 --> 01:13:07.200
I bounce off walls,
lose my footing and fall

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:10.828
Can be sweet though incomplete,
though...

01:13:10.928 --> 01:13:13.873
I really wish you weren't
wearing that uniform right now.

01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:16.542
It's got nothing to do
with the uniform, believe me.

01:13:16.642 --> 01:13:17.752
Well, what is it, your vow?

01:13:17.852 --> 01:13:20.339
You took a vow to be dead
from the neck down?

01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:23.800
Come on.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:25.885
I've seen the way you look at me.

01:13:25.985 --> 01:13:28.930
You know the way that I feel about you.

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:31.349
Come on, I'm not blind. It's okay.

01:13:31.449 --> 01:13:32.684
It's okay.

01:13:32.784 --> 01:13:34.519
No.

01:13:34.619 --> 01:13:36.896
Why? Because I...
I painted the wall out?

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:39.399
Is that it?
So now I'm no use to you, right?

01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:40.692
Is that it?

01:13:40.792 --> 01:13:42.611
Answer me!

01:13:44.128 --> 01:13:47.324
You are so proud
of your holy abstinence!

01:13:50.093 --> 01:13:52.704
Like touching a woman would kill you!

01:13:52.804 --> 01:13:56.166
Women are dirty little complications!

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:01.296
That's why you became a priest!

01:14:01.396 --> 01:14:05.259
It has nothing to do
with your convenient little stories!

01:14:11.072 --> 01:14:16.770
Oh, you're so proud of your church,
of virgins and eunuchs!

01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:49.344
How's your faith these days, Father?

01:14:50.611 --> 01:14:52.556
How's your faith these days?

01:14:53.448 --> 01:14:56.518
This is what you fucking call God?

01:14:59.787 --> 01:15:02.190
Blood of Christ!

01:18:17.193 --> 01:18:19.845
I've never seen you pray before.

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:22.516
I haven't prayed for a very long time.

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:26.603
Come here.

01:18:28.371 --> 01:18:30.565
It's okay. Come on.

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:35.839
Go in.

01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:52.480
Daniel.

01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:54.316
We've come to help.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.612
Take her to the archdiocese
straightaway.

01:20:18.522 --> 01:20:20.592
I'll be downstairs
if you need me, Sister.

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:29.600
Where did you get this from, hmm?
What does it mean?

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:32.603
The girl wrote it.
I don't know what it means.

01:20:32.703 --> 01:20:34.939
Neither does she.

01:20:35.039 --> 01:20:39.110
Why was it painted over?
What language is it in?

01:20:39.210 --> 01:20:40.361
It's Aramaic.

01:20:40.461 --> 01:20:41.946
How do you know that?

01:20:42.046 --> 01:20:44.490
That's completely irrelevant.

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:47.702
See, what I don't understand
is why you would send this

01:20:47.802 --> 01:20:49.578
to anyone other than me.

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:50.996
What are you hiding from me, Andrew?

01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:54.583
Look, all I know is that the girl
is fighting for her life.

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:58.170
If she receives another wound,
she's going to die unless we help her.

01:20:58.270 --> 01:21:01.048
Right. I'm taking over this case.
Go back to Father Durning's.

01:21:01.148 --> 01:21:03.134
- Get some rest.
- I'm not leaving her alone.

01:21:03.234 --> 01:21:04.593
You're not leaving her alone.

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:06.262
You're leaving her
in the care of the sisters.

01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:08.764
Look, you sent me here.
I didn't want to come.

01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:11.559
You told me to deal with her!
That's what I'm doing!

01:21:11.659 --> 01:21:13.936
She's in no condition
to take on you or the Church.

01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:17.690
This is not about a girl taking on me
or taking on the Church!

01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:20.067
Why are you so concerned
about those photographs?

01:21:20.167 --> 01:21:22.069
Why is that more important
than a girl bleeding to death?

01:21:22.169 --> 01:21:23.988
Andrew, what's happened to you?
Where's your loyalty?

01:21:24.088 --> 01:21:26.365
Don't you lecture me
about loyalty, Daniel.

01:21:26.465 --> 01:21:29.702
The only reason you've been tolerated
by the congregation for so long

01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:33.205
is because you were a good scientist,
because of your objectivity.

01:21:33.305 --> 01:21:34.874
But you've lost that.

01:21:34.974 --> 01:21:38.335
The last thing I expected to see
when I walked into that girl's apartment

01:21:38.435 --> 01:21:40.337
was the two of you
lying on a bed together.

01:21:40.437 --> 01:21:41.547
Oh, come on.

01:21:41.647 --> 01:21:43.841
Look, I know you think
you're helping her, but you're not.

01:21:43.941 --> 01:21:46.719
If anything, she's getting worse.

01:21:46.819 --> 01:21:49.430
Andrew, you're in no state
to help anyone right now.

01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:50.806
You're exhausted. Look at you.

01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:53.142
Go to Father Durning's. Get some rest.

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:54.769
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

01:21:54.869 --> 01:21:57.938
Why are you so concerned
with these photographs?

01:21:58.038 --> 01:21:59.565
Father Delmonico showed them to us.

01:21:59.665 --> 01:22:01.317
He seemed to think they were important.

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:02.526
What do they mean?

01:22:02.626 --> 01:22:04.695
We've no idea, but we're working on it.

01:22:04.795 --> 01:22:07.323
Does it have anything to do
with the Gospel Commission?

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:09.868
We don't know. Good night, Andrew.

01:22:41.498 --> 01:22:43.193
Andrew Kiernan?

01:22:45.419 --> 01:22:48.155
- I'm Kiernan.
- I want to see Alameida.

01:22:48.255 --> 01:22:50.032
I don't know any Alameida.

01:22:50.132 --> 01:22:54.286
Delmonico faxed me
this copy of his document.

01:22:54.386 --> 01:22:56.747
A girl wrote this.
I saw her do it. What is this?

01:22:56.847 --> 01:23:02.002
It's maybe the most significant
Christian relic ever found.

01:23:02.102 --> 01:23:03.295
Why?

01:23:03.395 --> 01:23:06.465
It's an Aramaic scroll
from the first century

01:23:06.565 --> 01:23:09.385
discovered near the caves
of the Dead Sea Scrolls

01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:11.512
outside Jerusalem.

01:23:11.612 --> 01:23:16.976
Alameida and I concluded
that it is a gospel

01:23:17.076 --> 01:23:22.022
of Jesus Christ
in his own words, Aramaic.

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:24.441
But there are some factions
in the Vatican

01:23:24.541 --> 01:23:27.570
who believe that this document
could destroy

01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:29.780
the authority of the modern Church.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:31.616
How?

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:37.872
It was Jesus' words to his disciples
on the night of his last supper,

01:23:37.972 --> 01:23:39.874
his instructions to them

01:23:39.974 --> 01:23:43.752
on how to continue his church
after his death.

01:23:43.852 --> 01:23:46.714
Why would that be so... so threatening?

01:23:46.814 --> 01:23:50.467
When we gave our initial conclusions
to the Gospel Commission,

01:23:50.567 --> 01:23:53.262
Houseman ordered us
to stop our work immediately.

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:56.432
Alameida refused.
He stole the document and disappeared.

01:23:56.532 --> 01:23:59.727
Houseman excommunicated us
in our absence.

01:23:59.827 --> 01:24:01.645
You have no idea where he is?

01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:06.692
He doesn't want to be caught
until he finishes the translation.

01:24:06.792 --> 01:24:10.571
I'll show you this guy.
That's Delmonico, me, and Alameida.

01:24:10.671 --> 01:24:12.823
We were all translating
the new gospel together.

01:24:12.923 --> 01:24:16.368
I've seen this man.
Three weeks ago in Brazil.

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:19.246
- Yeah?
- He's dead.

01:24:19.346 --> 01:24:20.497
How do you know this?

01:24:20.597 --> 01:24:23.417
Because I saw him in his coffin
in a church in Belo Quinto.

01:24:23.517 --> 01:24:24.960
I'm sorry.

01:24:28.063 --> 01:24:31.634
Then it's all over. It's gone forever.

01:24:31.734 --> 01:24:33.386
Why was your work stopped?

01:24:34.945 --> 01:24:37.181
What was so threatening
about this gospel?

01:24:37.281 --> 01:24:39.433
Look around you, Father.
What do you see?

01:24:39.533 --> 01:24:42.561
- I see a church.
- It's a building.

01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:46.482
The true church of Jesus Christ
is so much more,

01:24:46.582 --> 01:24:49.318
not in buildings made of wood and stone.

01:24:49.418 --> 01:24:51.904
I love Jesus.

01:24:52.004 --> 01:24:54.573
I don't need an institution
between him and me.

01:24:54.673 --> 01:24:57.034
You see? Just God and man.

01:24:57.134 --> 01:24:59.244
No priests, no churches.

01:24:59.344 --> 01:25:02.456
The first words in Jesus' gospel are,

01:25:02.556 --> 01:25:07.336
"The kingdom of God is inside you

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:09.338
and all around you,

01:25:09.438 --> 01:25:12.591
not in buildings of wood and stone.

01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:15.886
'Split a piece of wood, and I'm there.

01:25:15.986 --> 01:25:18.013
Lift a stone and"'...

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:20.015
"'You will find me."'

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:21.351
Yes, Father.

01:25:24.286 --> 01:25:28.148
Why is Father Alameida wearing gloves?

01:25:28.248 --> 01:25:30.567
Alameida was a tormented man.

01:25:30.667 --> 01:25:33.946
Holy man. A very holy man.

01:25:34.046 --> 01:25:37.867
He wore the gloves to cover
the marks of the stigmata.

01:25:43.347 --> 01:25:45.290
She has the stigmata.

01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:47.418
That's why.

01:25:49.812 --> 01:25:52.589
She's just his messenger.

01:25:52.689 --> 01:25:55.385
Houseman will never let
this gospel get out.

01:25:57.444 --> 01:26:00.806
Almighty God, bless Your humble servant.

01:26:00.906 --> 01:26:03.726
Guide me with Your Holy Spirit
and forgive me,

01:26:03.826 --> 01:26:07.480
for I have sinned exceedingly
in thought, word, and deed.

01:26:27.599 --> 01:26:30.085
My sins deserve Your punishments

01:26:30.185 --> 01:26:34.757
because they have crucified
my loving savior, Jesus Christ, amen.

01:27:06.722 --> 01:27:10.584
Lord, do not remember our sins
or those of our forefathers.

01:27:10.684 --> 01:27:13.337
- Where's Andrew?
- And do not punish us for our offences.

01:27:13.437 --> 01:27:16.215
- Lead us not into temptation.
- But deliver us from evil.

01:27:16.315 --> 01:27:18.550
Save this woman, your servant.

01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:21.345
Spirit of lust,
by the power of Jesus Christ,

01:27:21.445 --> 01:27:24.723
I command you, come out of her body
now and for always.

01:27:24.823 --> 01:27:28.143
In the name... in the name
of Jesus Christ, I command you,

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:30.020
come out of her body now and for always.

01:27:31.538 --> 01:27:32.815
In the name of Jesus Christ...

01:27:37.794 --> 01:27:40.239
Be a tower of strength to her, O Lord!

01:27:40.339 --> 01:27:43.283
Why do you persecute me?

01:27:43.383 --> 01:27:45.452
Send her help
from the holy place, O Lord!

01:27:48.639 --> 01:27:49.915
Give her heavenly protection!

01:27:50.015 --> 01:27:53.127
Lord, hear my prayer!
Let the enemy have no victory over...

01:27:53.227 --> 01:27:55.170
Behold!

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:58.466
Your servant, dripping with blood!

01:28:03.487 --> 01:28:06.307
Embrace me, my child. I am the Church!

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:10.644
- I'm the Church.
- Stop! Stop!

01:28:10.744 --> 01:28:13.110
No! Get away from me!

01:28:14.414 --> 01:28:17.734
Get them out of here!
Get out of here! Get out!

01:28:17.834 --> 01:28:19.612
- Eminenza.
- Get out!

01:28:22.256 --> 01:28:24.408
Save this woman from woe, O Lord!

01:28:24.508 --> 01:28:27.085
Save this woman, your servant!

01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:35.252
Send her help
from the holy place, O Lord.

01:28:35.352 --> 01:28:37.713
Give her heavenly protection.

01:28:41.275 --> 01:28:44.846
Save this woman, O Lord!
Let the enemy have no victory over her!

01:28:50.325 --> 01:28:52.394
Send her help
from the holy place, O Lord.

01:28:56.707 --> 01:28:57.816
Frankie!

01:28:57.916 --> 01:29:01.279
You will not destroy my Church.

01:29:09.886 --> 01:29:11.539
Frankie!

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:14.542
You must not interrupt...

01:29:15.434 --> 01:29:18.587
What are you doing? Get away from her!

01:29:18.687 --> 01:29:20.881
- Get away from her!
- No! No!

01:29:20.981 --> 01:29:22.508
Get away!

01:29:24.564 --> 01:29:26.637
It's all right. It's okay.

01:29:26.737 --> 01:29:28.764
- I know what...
- Andrew!

01:29:28.864 --> 01:29:31.141
Get away from her!
You don't know what's going on here!

01:29:31.241 --> 01:29:34.061
You get off me! You lied to me!

01:29:34.161 --> 01:29:38.523
You tried to silence her.
You lied to me, you bastard.

01:29:38.623 --> 01:29:41.151
- Andrew...
- You tried to kill her!

01:29:41.251 --> 01:29:42.444
No!

01:29:42.544 --> 01:29:44.821
Listen! I know everything.

01:29:44.921 --> 01:29:47.199
I know why you closed down
the Gospel Commission.

01:29:47.299 --> 01:29:50.827
I know why you had Petrocelli
and Alameida excommunicated.

01:29:50.927 --> 01:29:53.413
I know all about the lies
you've been telling for years.

01:29:53.513 --> 01:29:55.832
There is no way you'll get away
with what you did to her!

01:29:55.932 --> 01:29:58.169
I will not let you destroy the Church.

01:30:00.187 --> 01:30:03.799
I promise you, you've spent
your last days in the Church.

01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:19.857
Are you Paolo Alameida?

01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:31.827
Give me your wisdom.
Let me be your messenger.

01:30:34.012 --> 01:30:36.206
A messenger believes.

01:30:36.306 --> 01:30:39.377
A messenger has faith.
You have only doubt.

01:31:02.207 --> 01:31:06.653
Jesus said, "The kingdom
of God is inside you

01:31:06.753 --> 01:31:11.450
and all around you,
not in mansions of wood and stone.

01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:14.453
Split a piece of wood, and I am there.

01:31:14.553 --> 01:31:18.416
Lift a stone... and you will find me."

01:31:21.852 --> 01:31:25.797
Brother Alameida,
I call upon you to release this woman.

01:31:25.897 --> 01:31:29.312
Give her grace and let her not come
into the ways of harm.

01:31:29.412 --> 01:31:31.595
Through Jesus Christ,
we have all been saved.

01:31:31.695 --> 01:31:34.014
Let us not fear any ill,

01:31:34.114 --> 01:31:36.850
for Jesus is with us
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,

01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:39.686
world without end, forever and ever.

01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:44.941
God bless your soul, Brother Alameida.

01:31:47.294 --> 01:31:48.820
And go in peace.

01:32:52.984 --> 01:32:55.262
Don't go, Frankie.

01:33:03.787 --> 01:33:05.523
Stay with me.

01:35:04.908 --> 01:35:09.354
Jesus said, "The kingdom
of God is inside you

01:35:09.454 --> 01:35:14.150
and all around you,
not in mansions of wood and stone."

01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:18.071
The kingdom of God is inside you
and all around you,

01:35:18.171 --> 01:35:20.657
not in buildings of wood and stone.

01:35:20.757 --> 01:35:23.076
Split a piece of wood, and I am there."

01:35:23.176 --> 01:35:26.496
These are the hidden sayings
that the living Jesus spoke.

01:35:26.596 --> 01:35:31.710
Whoever discovers the meaning
of these sayings will not taste death.

01:36:29.909 --> 01:36:34.398
Your eyes, they send me

01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:41.280
To eternity

01:36:43.006 --> 01:36:46.951
Your heart may cast me

01:36:47.051 --> 01:36:52.832
Down to hell

01:36:52.932 --> 01:36:56.336
I'm bound

01:36:56.436 --> 01:36:59.005
But lately

01:36:59.105 --> 01:37:02.092
It's your love

01:37:02.192 --> 01:37:08.682
It's condemnation enough

01:37:10.742 --> 01:37:16.856
Identify

01:37:16.956 --> 01:37:22.571
Please identify

01:37:23.463 --> 01:37:26.408
If it's me you want

01:37:26.508 --> 01:37:29.869
Standing by your side

01:37:29.969 --> 01:37:36.251
Identify

01:37:36.351 --> 01:37:42.882
These tears of mine

01:37:42.982 --> 01:37:45.719
Am I lonely

01:37:45.819 --> 01:37:50.057
Or am I just alive?

01:37:55.745 --> 01:38:01.192
I let time decide

01:38:01.292 --> 01:38:06.698
Who and what will stand this test

01:38:06.798 --> 01:38:09.534
Of love

01:38:09.634 --> 01:38:13.788
Your hands were speaking

01:38:13.888 --> 01:38:15.957
No

01:38:16.057 --> 01:38:20.170
I felt the movement

01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:22.589
Go

01:38:22.689 --> 01:38:26.384
The ice was breaking

01:38:26.484 --> 01:38:33.099
So I wonder why

01:38:33.199 --> 01:38:36.603
Did I

01:38:37.662 --> 01:38:43.777
Identify

01:38:43.877 --> 01:38:49.824
With you, my life?

01:38:49.924 --> 01:38:52.994
To leave me empty

01:38:53.094 --> 01:38:59.418
And see if I'd survive?

01:39:33.468 --> 01:39:39.666
For every questioned hour

01:39:39.766 --> 01:39:46.256
For every second devoured

01:39:46.356 --> 01:39:51.594
You let me wander you

01:39:51.694 --> 01:39:56.724
Into a myth

01:39:56.824 --> 01:40:01.271
That I live

01:40:01.371 --> 01:40:07.569
Identify

01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:14.033
Please identify

01:40:14.133 --> 01:40:17.120
If it's me you want

01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:20.540
Standing by your side

01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:26.754
Identify

01:40:26.854 --> 01:40:33.094
These tears of mine

01:40:33.194 --> 01:40:36.431
Am I lonely

01:40:36.531 --> 01:40:42.229
Or am I just alive?

01:40:43.204 --> 01:40:45.857
Am I lonely

01:40:45.957 --> 01:40:51.029
Or am I just alive?

01:40:52.305 --> 01:40:58.616
