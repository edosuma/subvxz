like the piggies at
your station. [imitates
pig squealing]

20:49.465 --> 20:52.338
- Who is this?
[ominous music]

20:57.038 --> 20:58.474
- [Officer] Lanford
Police Department.

20:58.518 --> 21:00.476
- This is Officer Loren
at the old station.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.173
I'm calling because I
received a prank call

21:02.217 --> 21:03.827
that needs to be traced.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.307
- [Officer] I'm
sorry, who's this?

21:05.351 --> 21:06.830
- Officer Loren.

21:06.874 --> 21:09.093
- [Officer] Any
relation to Will Loren?

21:09.137 --> 21:10.921
- Yes, he was my father.

21:10.965 --> 21:12.140
- [Officer] I'm
sorry to hear that.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.663
- Excuse me?

21:13.707 --> 21:14.664
- [Officer] We got a
lot going on over here

21:14.708 --> 21:16.275
and tracing prank calls

21:16.318 --> 21:17.406
is not at the top
of our priorities.

21:18.407 --> 21:19.278
- Hello?

21:37.557 --> 21:39.994
[gun firing]

22:09.458 --> 22:12.156

22:37.138 --> 22:39.793
[ominous music]

22:47.191 --> 22:49.063

you're safe now.

22:49.106 --> 22:50.456
We're here to help, come on,
we'll get you home, girls.

22:50.499 --> 22:53.372
Don't worry.
[siren blaring]

22:57.767 --> 23:00.291
[eerie music]

23:11.651 --> 23:13.740
- [Man] Get down
motherfucker, don't you move.

23:13.783 --> 23:15.176
You are fucking dead!

23:19.833 --> 23:22.270
- [Man] We pray in the
Temple of the Low God.

23:25.055 --> 23:27.188
- Please, if anyone's
got any information,

23:27.231 --> 23:30.844
I just want my daughter
back home safe.

24:06.793 --> 24:09.360
- [Officer] Officer
Loren, more prank calls?

24:09.404 --> 24:11.711
- No, there's a huge
pig tied up outside.

24:11.754 --> 24:14.322
- [Officer] [laughs] Well,
you don't hear that every day.

24:14.365 --> 24:16.019
- Well, what should
I do with it?

24:16.063 --> 24:17.368
- [Officer] Nothing.

24:17.412 --> 24:19.283
- Just leave it there?

24:19.327 --> 24:20.763
- [Officer] It's probably
safer if you stay inside.

24:20.807 --> 24:22.286
- Mm, yeah, why?
'Cause I'm a woman?

24:22.330 --> 24:23.766
- [Officer] No officer,

24:23.810 --> 24:25.551
I don't know if you
noticed on your way in,

24:25.594 --> 24:28.031
but we had some assholes
causing bullshit on our steps,

24:28.075 --> 24:29.685
well, now they're
doing it all over town

24:29.729 --> 24:31.513
and we're spread a little thin.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.297
So, if they left that
future bacon on your lawn

24:33.341 --> 24:36.170
and something were to
happen, I can't send back up.

24:36.213 --> 24:38.520
Whether or not you have tits
got nothing to do with it.

24:38.564 --> 24:39.390
- Fine.

24:41.175 --> 24:43.003
- [Officer] Look, I'm sorry.

24:43.046 --> 24:44.439
There's a lot going on here

24:44.483 --> 24:46.136
and you're the
closest punching bag.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.705
Leave the pig, we'll
get to it later.

24:54.014 --> 24:56.843
[pig snorting]

24:56.886 --> 25:00.542

28:10.514 --> 28:12.386
Sir, get to the ground.

28:24.833 --> 28:25.834
- I don't know...

28:35.365 --> 28:39.761
But I can't remember.
I can't remember.

28:45.898 --> 28:49.684
Where is she?
[taser buzzing]

28:53.601 --> 28:56.517
- Roll over on your stomach.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.563
Roll over.

[man grunting]

29:29.985 --> 29:32.509
[eerie music]

30:03.714 --> 30:04.715
Step inside.

30:05.934 --> 30:07.631
- She's here.
- Move.

30:09.068 --> 30:09.895
- My baby.

30:11.635 --> 30:14.203
- I said move.
- No!

30:16.292 --> 30:17.859
She's here.

30:17.903 --> 30:18.817
She's here.

30:19.905 --> 30:21.820
She's here. She's here!

30:25.388 --> 30:29.566
No, no... [sobs]

30:32.439 --> 30:35.094
She's here. She's here.
- All right, well, let's go.

30:35.137 --> 30:36.356
- Shut up! No, no!

30:38.967 --> 30:40.577
No!
- Fuck. Come on.

30:42.144 --> 30:43.580

No, you tell her.

31:29.975 --> 31:31.672
You tell her.

31:31.715 --> 31:35.197
Daddy didn't do it,
daddy didn't do it.

31:35.241 --> 31:36.372

someone on my first day.

[Jessica shouting]

still here, still here.

33:21.086 --> 33:23.392
[screaming]

33:35.143 --> 33:37.189
- I will maintain courageous
calm in the face of danger,

33:37.232 --> 33:40.322
scorn, or ridicule,
develop self restraint,

33:40.366 --> 33:44.979
and be constantly mindful of
the wellbeing of others...

33:46.241 --> 33:48.069
The welfare of others.

33:49.592 --> 33:52.117
I will be exemplary
in obeying the laws

33:52.160 --> 33:54.032
and the regulations
of my department.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.373
- [Cohen] Hello?

34:32.331 --> 34:33.158
Hello!

34:34.985 --> 34:38.337
- This is Officer Loren,
sorry to call you so late.

34:38.380 --> 34:39.425
- [Cohen] What is it?

34:42.428 --> 34:45.213
Your "um" better be followed
by the building is on fire

34:45.257 --> 34:46.909
or worse to be
calling at this hour.

34:46.954 --> 34:48.737
- When I first arrived
at the station,

34:48.782 --> 34:51.524
you were yelling at something,
I was curious what it was.

34:53.351 --> 34:55.266
- [Cohen] You were curious
and saw fit to wake me up

34:55.310 --> 34:56.790
in the middle of the night?

34:56.833 --> 34:58.661
- Yes, did did
you see something?

34:58.705 --> 35:01.011
- [Cohen] Right now, I see you
can't handle a simple shift.

35:01.055 --> 35:02.883
You're gonna have to be more-

35:02.926 --> 35:04.711
- Did you see something
that wasn't really there?

35:06.191 --> 35:07.888
- [Cohen] Damn it, did
you go into holding?

35:10.369 --> 35:12.153
- Well, I didn't have a choice.

35:12.197 --> 35:14.590
A homeless man broke
into the station, I...

35:14.634 --> 35:16.766
- [Cohen] Holding is covered
in black mold little girl,

35:16.810 --> 35:18.986
the shit is toxic,
makes you hallucinate.

35:20.422 --> 35:22.511
- But I was seeing
things before...

35:22.555 --> 35:23.382
- [Cohen] I told
you stay out of it.

35:23.425 --> 35:24.948
- But sir, I-

35:24.992 --> 35:25.949
- [Cohen] You don't
care to follow orders-

35:25.993 --> 35:27.734
- Yes I do, sir, I do.

35:27.777 --> 35:29.388
- [Cohen] I'll call the station,
have them send over a unit

35:29.431 --> 35:30.954
to pick up that
bum piece of shit.

35:30.998 --> 35:33.131
- No sir, You don't
understand, I was-

35:33.174 --> 35:34.697
- [Cohen] You need
me to come over there

35:34.741 --> 35:36.221
and hold your hand
like a little baby

35:36.264 --> 35:37.831
or you gonna shut the
fuck up and do your job?

35:39.833 --> 35:41.226
- I will do my job.

35:41.269 --> 35:43.184
- [Cohen] And?

35:43.228 --> 35:46.231
- And I will shut the fuck up.

35:47.667 --> 35:49.147
- [Cohen] Good,
don't call me again.

36:09.645 --> 36:12.387
[pig screeching]

36:21.179 --> 36:23.833
[ominous music]

37:22.240 --> 37:25.895
[siren wailing in distance]

37:37.429 --> 37:40.345
[tires screeching]

37:42.390 --> 37:46.699
- Get out of...
[woman screaming]

37:46.742 --> 37:49.963
- Motherfucker, fuck you.
- Hey!

37:50.006 --> 37:53.488
[car engine roaring]
- Fuck you, fucking asshole!

37:53.532 --> 37:54.881
- You all right?

38:07.372 --> 38:08.634
- What?

38:08.677 --> 38:11.289
- This your first day?
- Yeah.

38:11.332 --> 38:13.029
- [chuckles] I figured.

38:13.073 --> 38:15.293
No seasoned cop would
clean me up like this.

38:17.991 --> 38:19.688
My daddy was a cop.
- Really?

38:21.995 --> 38:23.431
Now you?

38:23.475 --> 38:26.826
- I trick to pay the
bills, it's not my job.

38:26.869 --> 38:27.783
- What's your job?

38:29.002 --> 38:31.004
- I work in sanitation.

38:31.047 --> 38:36.009
Some of these fuckers,
they like to go after kids.

38:38.228 --> 38:40.230
Especially at the truck stops.

38:40.274 --> 38:43.016
Happens more than you
think, a lot more.

38:43.059 --> 38:46.846
So when I see it happen,
I take out the trash.

38:53.156 --> 38:55.942
- So, you do what to them?

38:59.032 --> 38:59.859
Hey.

39:02.209 --> 39:04.559
Hey. [snaps fingers] You there?

39:04.603 --> 39:06.344
- Just drifted
there for a moment.

39:07.562 --> 39:09.651
You here alone.
- Why?

39:09.695 --> 39:13.089
- I wouldn't wanna be here
alone, not after what happened.

39:13.133 --> 39:14.656
- With the officers?

39:14.700 --> 39:16.223
- Well, I don't know
nothing about that.

39:16.266 --> 39:18.312
I mean, what happened
with the mountain flock.

39:19.661 --> 39:21.620
I was there that
night in the next cell

39:21.663 --> 39:23.578
and they were bragging
about what they'd done.

39:23.622 --> 39:27.234
Killed that girl, and it
wasn't the first time either.

39:27.277 --> 39:28.148
- What night?

39:29.279 --> 39:30.585
- The night they
hung themselves.

39:32.282 --> 39:34.633
- They died in an officer
involved shooting.

39:34.676 --> 39:36.374
- Did you see it happen?
- No.

39:38.158 --> 39:40.726
- I bet my tits and a pack
of cigarettes it's the truth.

39:40.769 --> 39:42.510
I saw it when they
were moving me,

39:42.554 --> 39:46.688
had pillowcases over their
heads, blood all over the walls,

39:46.732 --> 39:47.907
blood all over the...

39:51.214 --> 39:53.869
[ominous music]

40:01.964 --> 40:02.791
- What is it?

40:06.404 --> 40:07.405
What's wrong?

40:09.581 --> 40:13.672
- Not gonna say...
anything else...

40:13.715 --> 40:18.416
- What are you looking at?
- Say... anything more...

40:19.373 --> 40:20.200
- Hey!

40:22.028 --> 40:25.553
- From the kingdom of our
father, faithful and true,

40:26.989 --> 40:29.775
our flock we will
follow devoted in you,

40:32.647 --> 40:35.433
on this day in his arms...

40:35.476 --> 40:36.651
...my soul, I will
bring. For the king...

40:37.739 --> 40:40.612
He rejoices, when the dead sing!

40:42.701 --> 40:47.662
- Okay, I'm... I'm gonna
call you an ambulance, okay?

40:47.706 --> 40:49.534
Okay?

40:49.577 --> 40:52.450
[woman screaming]

41:08.422 --> 41:11.512
- Sorry, I just drifted
there for a moment.

41:11.556 --> 41:13.471
- I think it's
time for you to go.

41:13.514 --> 41:15.647
- Okay, okay, okay.

41:15.690 --> 41:17.649
I just, shit.

41:19.128 --> 41:20.956
You have a tampon
I could borrow?

41:21.000 --> 41:22.871
Can't earn worth a damn
with my guts spilling out.

41:22.915 --> 41:24.394
- Get out.
- Okay, okay.

41:28.050 --> 41:30.096
[chair clattering]

41:30.139 --> 41:32.533
[phone ringing]

41:32.577 --> 41:34.274
- Lanford Police Department.

41:34.317 --> 41:35.797
- [Woman] Hello, little piggy.

41:38.626 --> 41:41.324
[phone ringing]

41:42.848 --> 41:44.676
- Lanford Police Department.

41:44.719 --> 41:47.156
- [Woman] Hang up again and I
will fucking kill this girl.

41:48.810 --> 41:49.681
You understand?

41:51.291 --> 41:52.118
- What girl?

41:53.249 --> 41:55.121
- [Woman] Oh, I don't know.

41:55.164 --> 41:59.386
It's Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe,
catch a hostage by her toe.

41:59.429 --> 42:02.955
Monica Matthews, do
you know that name?

42:02.998 --> 42:04.783
- What kind of game
are you playing?

42:04.826 --> 42:06.915
- Give it a nibble-
[screeching]

42:06.959 --> 42:07.786
- Stop!

42:08.874 --> 42:10.702
- [Woman] Do you know that name?

42:10.745 --> 42:14.488
- Yes, she was one of the
girls my father rescued.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.185
- [Woman] There you
go, that's right.

42:16.229 --> 42:17.665
- What do you want?

42:17.709 --> 42:19.841
- [Woman] It's
not me, it's John.

42:19.885 --> 42:22.583
Trust in his-

01:00:21.139 --> 01:00:22.531
Don't touch it, okay?

01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:28.799
It stays here.

01:00:30.931 --> 01:00:33.368

01:00:36.328 --> 01:00:38.809
- We devote ourselves to you

01:00:38.852 --> 01:00:40.419
as you shall be to us,

01:00:41.855 --> 01:00:45.511
faithfully, with great
purpose and ritual.

01:00:47.034 --> 01:00:50.342
The Temple Baron will
bring forth the Low God

01:00:51.909 --> 01:00:53.867
and I will be redeemer,

01:00:55.608 --> 01:01:00.004
king of torment and starless
nights, Infinum Malum.

01:01:06.575 --> 01:01:09.013
I baptize thee in my blood,

01:01:11.493 --> 01:01:15.759
bound no more to this
flesh, but to another.

01:01:15.802 --> 01:01:20.807
[child crying]
You are one of us.

01:01:28.032 --> 01:01:30.295
You are one of us, Jessica.

01:01:30.338 --> 01:01:33.124
[child crying]
She is one of us!

01:01:33.167 --> 01:01:36.257
[Jessica gasping]
- She's one of us, let me out!

01:01:36.301 --> 01:01:38.216
Please, she's one of us!

01:01:38.259 --> 01:01:40.174
Let me out! Let me out!

01:01:41.088 --> 01:01:42.568
You have to let me out!

01:01:42.611 --> 01:01:44.526
You have to let me out!

01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:47.660
Can you hear them?

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:50.097
- She must be present on
the night of his arrival.

01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:52.970
She must summon power.

01:01:53.013 --> 01:01:55.581
She must devote herself.

01:01:55.624 --> 01:01:59.759
She must participate for
great purpose and ritual.

01:02:14.121 --> 01:02:16.123
[pig snorting]

01:02:21.128 --> 01:02:26.133
- [Woman] Daddy,
[sobs] I wanna go home.

01:02:27.047 --> 01:02:27.744
I just wanna go home.

01:02:32.661 --> 01:02:33.662
I'm in here.

01:02:36.013 --> 01:02:36.840
- Betty?

01:02:41.018 --> 01:02:43.411
- Help me, I wanna go home.

01:02:43.455 --> 01:02:44.978
[ghostly moaning]

01:02:45.022 --> 01:02:46.501
- [Diane] You've reached Diane,

01:02:46.545 --> 01:02:48.939
if I don't care
about you, fuck off.

01:02:48.982 --> 01:02:50.723
- I'm at the old station
where dad worked,

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:52.333
call me as soon as you get this.

01:02:53.552 --> 01:02:56.033
[baby cooing]

01:02:58.339 --> 01:03:01.038
- Shh. It's okay.

01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:04.781
That's my little Jessica.

01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:09.437
[pig snorting]

01:03:16.053 --> 01:03:17.489
It's gonna be okay.

01:03:17.532 --> 01:03:19.447
Daddy's gonna find us.

01:03:19.491 --> 01:03:21.014
You don't know your daddy yet,

01:03:21.058 --> 01:03:24.061
but he just became
a police officer.

01:03:24.104 --> 01:03:26.150
[pig snorting]

01:03:26.193 --> 01:03:29.457
He's got a glove on
his belt and a gun.

01:03:29.501 --> 01:03:30.894
And when he gets here,

01:03:30.937 --> 01:03:32.939
he'll beat John until
he stops moving.

01:03:34.767 --> 01:03:38.945
He'll wanna kill him, but he
won't because he's a good man.

01:03:40.468 --> 01:03:44.037
But John never forgets,
and he'll find us.

01:03:54.091 --> 01:03:56.180
[creature shrieking]
[Jessica screaming]

01:03:56.223 --> 01:03:58.660

01:05:05.597 --> 01:05:07.686
[ominous music]

01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:15.781
[bell ringing]

01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:29.534
- [banging] Open
the fucking door.

01:05:31.231 --> 01:05:32.711
I thought you were working
at the new station.

01:05:32.754 --> 01:05:34.669
Why would you be here?
- You lied to me.

01:05:34.713 --> 01:05:36.323
- I lied about a lot of shit.

01:05:36.367 --> 01:05:37.585
- You wanna narrow that down?

01:05:37.629 --> 01:05:38.673
You were one of them.

01:05:39.892 --> 01:05:40.849
- How do you know that?
- Oh shit,

01:05:40.893 --> 01:05:41.459
it's true, isn't it?

01:05:45.985 --> 01:05:48.945
- I left your father
after we were pregnant

01:05:48.988 --> 01:05:50.468
because John found me.

01:05:50.511 --> 01:05:53.210
He just came knocking
on the door and he said,

01:05:53.253 --> 01:05:56.300
your baby was gonna be
part of something so big.

01:05:56.343 --> 01:05:57.301
I believed him.

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:01.566
After you were
born, I saw things

01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:04.177
and I needed to get you as far
away from them as possible.

01:06:04.221 --> 01:06:05.744
Your daddy saved us.

01:06:05.787 --> 01:06:07.354
We ran, we left
our lives behind,

01:06:07.398 --> 01:06:09.226
but a year ago, he found us.

01:06:10.575 --> 01:06:12.359
[John laughing]
John hadn't aged a day,

01:06:12.403 --> 01:06:15.449
it was like staring
at a bad memory.

01:06:15.493 --> 01:06:17.364
He wanted us back, baby.

01:06:17.408 --> 01:06:22.413
Will stopped him,
but John had plans.

01:06:23.153 --> 01:06:24.632
He always does.

01:06:24.676 --> 01:06:26.591
- What was I meant
to be part of?

01:06:26.634 --> 01:06:27.461
- [Voice] Diane.

01:06:29.724 --> 01:06:33.859
- Answer me, where
are you going? Diane?

01:06:36.557 --> 01:06:38.472
- [Voice] Diane. Diane.

01:06:42.911 --> 01:06:44.304
- Diane, what are you doing?

01:06:54.184 --> 01:06:55.837
Mom.

01:06:57.622 --> 01:07:00.277
[woman shouting in distance]
Lock the door, stay here.

01:07:01.191 --> 01:07:04.020
[woman screaming]

01:07:09.416 --> 01:07:12.419
This is Officer Loren, I
need fucking backup now.

01:07:19.992 --> 01:07:23.691
- Please, help me.
- Holster, your pistol.

01:07:23.735 --> 01:07:25.258
- Put the gun down.
- Holster,

01:07:25.302 --> 01:07:26.955
your fucking pistol.
- Put the gun down.

01:07:26.999 --> 01:07:28.609
- Do it or I'll kill her.
- Put it down!

01:07:28.653 --> 01:07:31.003
- Holster your pistol now!
- Okay, okay.

01:07:33.005 --> 01:07:34.746
Where are the other girls?

01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:37.662
- It's your night and
that's all you have to ask?

01:07:37.705 --> 01:07:40.447
You're crazy, just
like your mother.

01:07:40.491 --> 01:07:42.362
- Let her go, I already
requested backup.

01:07:42.406 --> 01:07:44.930
- Nobody's coming,
you're on your own.

01:07:44.973 --> 01:07:46.453
- What do you want?

01:07:46.497 --> 01:07:50.675
It's not what I want,
it's what he wants.

01:07:50.718 --> 01:07:52.242
And he wants you.

01:07:52.285 --> 01:07:54.679
- Well, I'm right here
cunt, come and get me.

01:07:54.722 --> 01:07:57.508
- Patience piggy,
your time will come.

01:07:57.551 --> 01:07:59.684
The Low God's been
whispering in John's ear

01:07:59.727 --> 01:08:01.903
ever since you were
in your mama's belly.

01:08:01.947 --> 01:08:04.341
And he knew you would
come back to him.

01:08:04.384 --> 01:08:07.344
You know, I'd hoped I'd
be the one by his side.

01:08:07.387 --> 01:08:12.218
But I know what I'm here for,
I have a message for you.

01:08:12.262 --> 01:08:15.569
You see, you need
power for this ritual

01:08:15.613 --> 01:08:19.703
and there there is
power in spilling blood.

01:08:19.746 --> 01:08:20.879
- Please.

01:08:20.922 --> 01:08:22.054
- An animal will give you some.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:23.533
- Don't you fucking touch her.

01:08:23.577 --> 01:08:24.621
- But a human will
give you more.

01:08:24.665 --> 01:08:27.494
[gunshots firing]

01:08:29.235 --> 01:08:32.890
- I'm gonna get you little
piggy! I'm coming to get you!

01:08:32.934 --> 01:08:35.763
[people shouting]

01:08:43.596 --> 01:08:44.424
- Mom?

01:08:48.994 --> 01:08:49.821
Mom?

01:08:55.348 --> 01:08:56.175
Mom!

01:08:57.523 --> 01:09:00.397
[phone ringing]

01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.834
Hello?
- Good, good, you're okay.

01:09:02.877 --> 01:09:05.358
Listen, we think the
flock is planning a raid

01:09:05.402 --> 01:09:07.143
on the old station.
- They're here.

01:09:07.185 --> 01:09:08.492
- [Officer] Fuck,
fuck, all right,

01:09:08.535 --> 01:09:09.493
we'll get you out of there.

01:09:09.536 --> 01:09:11.103
Is your mother safe?

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:15.412
- I can't find her.
I can't, I can't...

01:09:15.455 --> 01:09:17.153
How do you know
my mother's here?

01:09:18.589 --> 01:09:22.288
- Oh, well, I always
keep tabs on her.

01:09:23.768 --> 01:09:26.249
She was one of my
favorite jewels,

01:09:28.032 --> 01:09:30.340
as devoted as they come.

01:09:31.558 --> 01:09:33.211
Pure fire.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:35.910
- Who is this?

01:09:37.694 --> 01:09:40.131
- [Man On Phone] I told your
daddy that I'd come back

01:09:40.175 --> 01:09:41.219
for all he loved.

01:09:42.874 --> 01:09:45.005
- Where the fuck is my mother?

01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:48.880
- [Man On Phone] A vessel must
be chosen by its passenger.

01:09:50.011 --> 01:09:53.014
I was chosen when I was a boy

01:09:53.058 --> 01:09:56.583
and tonight, the Low
God finally comes.

01:09:58.498 --> 01:10:01.022
