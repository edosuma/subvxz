WEBVTT

00:02.160 --> 00:04.640
You've heard of Votura.

00:04.800 --> 00:06.962
Makes any subject extremely susceptible
to suggestion...

00:07.120 --> 00:09.088
...while retaining no
memory of their actions.

00:09.320 --> 00:12.563
- I will tell Ra's.
- He will still kill her. She fired the arrows.

00:12.720 --> 00:14.768
The bioweapon is comprised
of two components.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.764
The Omega she has is harmless
without its counterpart, Alpha.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.922
I trust my father.
And he explained to me...

00:20.160 --> 00:22.527
...that every name
on that list has a reason to be there.

00:22.760 --> 00:26.128
A few years ago, I found a message
he left me explaining the list.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.327
How is that possible?

00:27.480 --> 00:30.484
- You were on a deserted island.
- I didn't say that I found it on the island.

00:30.640 --> 00:33.211
Chien Na Wei has left Hong Kong.
I've tracked her here.

00:33.920 --> 00:37.527
- Where are we?
- Welcome home, Mr. Queen.

01:02.240 --> 01:05.687
- Did you learn all this in nine months?
- Malcolm's a good teacher.

01:08.480 --> 01:09.686
Did he teach you to cheat?

01:09.920 --> 01:13.527
He said there's no such thing.
There's only survival and death.

01:13.760 --> 01:14.841
He's not wrong.

01:20.600 --> 01:22.489
This is good. What is it?

01:22.720 --> 01:25.644
If I told you what it was,
you probably wouldn't eat it.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.564
Is it weird?
You know, being back here with me?

01:32.760 --> 01:34.922
I've been back here before.

01:35.400 --> 01:39.564
You know, in a lot of ways,
this place reminds me of who I am.

01:39.760 --> 01:42.411
Or I guess who I've become.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.840
It's probably why Malcolm suggested
we train here.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.644
It's kind of cool that we're here.

01:47.840 --> 01:52.004
It's like there's really no more secrets
between us anymore.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.125
Yeah.

01:55.400 --> 01:59.371
When you were here, did you ever think
you were gonna see us again?

01:59.880 --> 02:01.450
Get home again?

02:06.520 --> 02:09.922
Chien Na Wei touched ground
in Starling 24 hours ago.

02:10.520 --> 02:13.205
We're trying to determine
how she made it into the country.

02:13.440 --> 02:17.764
But we believe she's here to auction off
the Omega bioweapon to the highest bidder.

02:17.960 --> 02:20.406
The Omega's inert without its counterpart.

02:20.560 --> 02:23.404
- Who's gonna pay for a useless super virus?
- Rogue nations.

02:23.600 --> 02:27.650
Terrorist groups who believe they can
replicate the Alpha component on their own.

02:27.800 --> 02:31.202
- Why does she have to sell it here?
- There's a corporate executive in town.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.164
A man on the Triad's payroll.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.688
He's committed several acts
of industrial espionage over the years.

02:37.680 --> 02:38.966
His name is Peter Kang.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.571
Yeah, I know him.

02:41.320 --> 02:45.484
He works at my family's company.
That guy came to my house for Christmas.

02:45.720 --> 02:49.406
And that, Mr. Queen, is exactly
why you and Mr. Yamashiro are still alive.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.642
Chien Na Wei chose the one place
on earth...

02:51.840 --> 02:55.162
...where your continued breathing is
still of use to me and my superior.

02:55.440 --> 02:57.010
But have no illusions.

02:57.200 --> 03:01.285
If you threaten to compromise the mission
by contacting anyone in Starling City...

03:01.480 --> 03:04.131
...I will remove you and Mr. Yamashiro
from the equation.

03:04.320 --> 03:08.484
Along with anyone
who discovers Oliver Queen is still alive.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.041
Tracker's in place.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.641
Now what? Follow Kang to Chien Na Wei?

03:30.800 --> 03:33.201
No, she's too smart
to keep the Omega on her person.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.562
She'll keep it secure till the auction.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.206
We need to figure out
where that auction's gonna be.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.645
Kang's on the move.

04:04.120 --> 04:06.282
Laurel, hey.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.721
What you having, sweetheart?
Next round's on me.

04:10.320 --> 04:13.642
Your desk sergeant called
wondering why you weren't on duty.

04:13.840 --> 04:17.925
Yeah. Well, this is Laurel.
You know, the daughter that lived.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.851
Is there a bartender in the city
that doesn't know that?

04:21.040 --> 04:23.884
Well, excuse me
for seeking a sympathetic ear.

04:25.360 --> 04:28.011
Takes more than some fancy
corporate law-firm job...

04:28.240 --> 04:31.210
...for some of us to get over Sara's death.

04:32.240 --> 04:35.562
I love you, so I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say that and drive you home.

04:35.760 --> 04:39.651
Not now, sweetie. Not now, please.
Hit me again, Frank.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.523
Later, Frank.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.964
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.210
Kang's headed inside.

05:09.400 --> 05:12.210
A.R.G.U.S. detected data emanating
from Kang's computer.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.402
But it's protected by SHACAL-4 encryption.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.927
- Okay, pretend like I don't know what that is.
- It means we can't hack into Kang's computer.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.606
You'll need to get
onto the Queen Consolidated network.

05:22.800 --> 05:26.009
Waller was clear what would happen to
people if they found out I'm still alive.

05:26.200 --> 05:30.091
So taking a stroll through my family's
company is probably not the best plan.

05:30.280 --> 05:34.604
You'll go in at night. I don't have time to
familiarize myself with the office floor plans.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.566
Oh, my God.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.361
Who is that?

05:49.080 --> 05:50.923
That's my sister.

05:54.160 --> 05:58.529
Sara. Sara.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.082
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

06:02.280 --> 06:04.362
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, why?

06:04.560 --> 06:06.130
You kept saying Sara's name.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.089
Oh. Um...

06:09.280 --> 06:12.011
Yeah, well, I was... I was dreaming.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.531
Why didn't you tell me?

06:13.760 --> 06:17.003
- What?
- That Sara died.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.328
Laurel told me.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.130
Kind of by accident, but...

06:22.920 --> 06:24.888
Well, I didn't want to upset you.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.048
And Laurel didn't want...

06:27.280 --> 06:29.965
...anyone to know.
Why?

06:30.200 --> 06:33.886
After everything that
happened with Slade...

06:34.120 --> 06:36.248
...Sara went back
to the League of Assassins.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.806
She had her own secrets, Thea.

06:41.040 --> 06:44.487
And, uh...

06:44.640 --> 06:46.881
...those weren't my secrets to share.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.401
Was it the League that killed her?

06:53.160 --> 06:55.845
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna...

06:56.680 --> 06:58.569
...take a walk and clear my head.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.530
Slade.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.407
Told myself I wasn't gonna
come down here.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.649
That I never needed to see you again.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.163
You'll be happy to know I was wrong.

08:02.680 --> 08:05.524
You think I won't get out?

08:06.200 --> 08:08.965
You think I wouldn't
kill those you care for?

08:11.320 --> 08:14.403
I keep my promises, kid.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.924
I keep my promises.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.963
Thea.

08:37.039 --> 08:39.327
Hey, the fire went out.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.841
- Ollie, what is it?
- We need to get off the island.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.162
- We're in danger.
- What are you talking about?

08:44.360 --> 08:46.283
- Slade Wilson's here.
- That is ridiculous.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.448
It's not. Just listen to me.

08:48.640 --> 08:51.041
- Slade was...
- I was keeping him prisoner here.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.930
What do you mean "was"?

08:58.360 --> 09:00.488
- Hello, Oliver.
- You let him out.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.882
You told me you lost your deal with Ra's...

09:03.080 --> 09:05.811
...despite your willingness to kill him
because you hesitated.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.050
For you and Thea and even myself to have
any hope of surviving the next encounter...

09:10.280 --> 09:14.251
...you need to regain that killer instinct
born of a primal need to survive.

09:14.440 --> 09:16.010
You're sick.

09:16.840 --> 09:20.128
Your sat phone is going to stop working
after this call.

09:23.680 --> 09:24.806
Ollie.

09:25.680 --> 09:28.001
Merlyn set Slade loose as an object lesson.

09:28.200 --> 09:32.091
- That's insane.
- He thinks it'll help me regain my killer instinct.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.163
- If he doesn't kill us first.
- Come on.

09:41.720 --> 09:45.122
- Last time I saw her, she was in pigtails.
- Wait here, okay?

09:50.720 --> 09:52.722
Where is she going?

10:00.320 --> 10:01.810
Hi, Ollie, Dad.

10:03.360 --> 10:05.886
I stopped by the office today.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.765
I saw Morn talking to Walter.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.890
Starting to think
that something's happening there.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.050
- But I don't know.
- Queenie.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.929
Sister's boyfriend?

10:17.280 --> 10:19.248
- I don't know.
- You have my delivery?

10:19.440 --> 10:21.169
You have some of that inheritance?

10:24.560 --> 10:26.801
- What the hell is this?
- What are you doing here?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.890
- I was about to ask Jordan the same.
- Just paying my respects.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.445
And so you did.

10:31.640 --> 10:34.325
Now you're gonna stay away
from her permanently.

10:34.520 --> 10:35.681
Whatever.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.963
You should be bringing flowers here.
Not looking to score drugs.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.850
What are you even doing here, Tommy?

10:44.080 --> 10:46.526
I came to thank you for my birthday card.

10:47.320 --> 10:50.290
And to tell you
that my party tonight's 21 and over.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.687
Well, I think we both know that
that's not true.

10:52.920 --> 10:54.922
Oh, it is, as far as you're concerned.

10:55.680 --> 10:59.526
- You shouldn't grow up too fast.
- Yeah, well, you're not my brother.

11:00.200 --> 11:04.250
You're right, no, I'm not,
but I think about him every single day.

11:04.440 --> 11:07.364
For the first time, I'm glad he's gone.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.921
Because seeing you like this
would break his heart.

11:11.080 --> 11:16.211
It's funny how Ollie seems to care more about
me now that he's dead than when he was alive.

11:33.200 --> 11:36.886
Every time I spoke to his grave,
it always felt so empty.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.287
That's because he was here
watching over you.

11:39.480 --> 11:40.970
Why did you bring me here?

11:42.840 --> 11:44.171
He has something we need.

11:44.360 --> 11:49.082
- I thought you were better with a bow.
- I am. It's for you. Just in case.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.564
What is it?

11:58.640 --> 12:00.483
He's been here.

12:06.920 --> 12:09.685
Nice to see you again...

12:09.840 --> 12:11.126
...Miss Queen.

12:23.720 --> 12:26.087
- You okay?
- Yeah.

12:28.160 --> 12:29.207
She's unhurt.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.324
I have no desire to kill either of you.

12:37.600 --> 12:41.286
This time tomorrow, two bodies
will be found in Starling City...

12:41.480 --> 12:43.164
...burned beyond any recognition...

12:43.400 --> 12:44.845
...but ample evidence...

12:45.040 --> 12:49.523
...that Oliver and Thea Queen
have been killed in some horrible accident.

12:49.720 --> 12:52.883
I'm gonna leave you, kid,
the same way you left me.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.366
Alone in purgatory.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.722
You leave me and you let my sister go.

13:01.600 --> 13:04.251
You're lucky I didn't
bury her next to Shado.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.327
Did he tell you about her?

13:09.920 --> 13:11.081
Shado...

13:11.640 --> 13:13.768
...is the reason why this is all happening.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.371
Why I killed your mother.

13:15.600 --> 13:16.647
He doesn't need to.

13:16.840 --> 13:19.969
I figured out you're a sick son of a bitch
all on my own.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.328
Well, of course he didn't tell you.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.049
Your brother likes his secrets.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.161
You always have.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.406
That's who you are.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.410
You know, if you'd told me
what really happened with Shado...

13:35.560 --> 13:37.324
...your mother would still be alive.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.488
- That's enough!
- I agree!

13:49.360 --> 13:51.362
Welcome home, kid.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.684
Slade.

13:54.880 --> 13:55.927
Slade.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.520
Slade!

14:22.040 --> 14:24.042
Are you in position?

14:27.920 --> 14:29.365
- Yeah.
- The company computers...

14:29.560 --> 14:31.642
...are protected by biometric encryption.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.365
Look for a fingerprint reader.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.604
Okay, but why wouldn't they take me out
of the directory?

14:36.800 --> 14:38.643
Why would they? You're dead.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.370
Yeah, I'm in.

14:51.560 --> 14:54.643
The crawler's programmed
to seek out all of Kang's network traffic.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.524
And it's running.

15:02.720 --> 15:05.530
The program should take 90 seconds.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.410
What's that?

15:35.320 --> 15:37.641
- Oliver, you have to go.
- I'm not done.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.203
You have to go. Someone's coming.

16:08.640 --> 16:10.608
You're cute.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.968
It's too bad you're, you know, dead.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.970
Which is obviously a lot worse for you
than it is for me.

16:19.920 --> 16:22.048
I really need to learn...

16:22.240 --> 16:24.846
...to stop talking to myself.

16:27.840 --> 16:32.004
According to the information we took off
Kang's computer, the auction is tonight.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.770
- In four hours.
- Where?

16:33.920 --> 16:35.046
Still working on that.

16:35.240 --> 16:38.483
The crawler program
retrieved 2.7 gigabytes of data.

16:38.720 --> 16:42.247
- It's taking some time to cull through.
- You have less than four hours.

16:43.760 --> 16:44.807
Where's Queen?

16:47.720 --> 16:50.166
Probably went to check on our weapons.

16:50.920 --> 16:55.642
You spin my head right round, right round

16:55.800 --> 16:57.529
Oh.

16:57.680 --> 17:00.411
- Pig.
- A little early.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.767
H00. Uch.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.523
Thanks, bud.

17:06.079 --> 17:08.048
Yeah, no problem...

17:08.480 --> 17:10.050
...bud.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.724
Whoo.

17:14.760 --> 17:17.730
Nothing like a rich kid's party
to remind me what I missed...

17:17.880 --> 17:19.608
...about being shot at in Afghanistan.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.484
When I hooked up my brother
with his first stateside job...

17:22.720 --> 17:25.371
...I somehow expected more gratitude
and less complaining.

17:25.599 --> 17:29.002
- Less complaining. You sound like Lyla.
- You should've never divorced her.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.770
You big dummy.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.170
Thank you, Andy. I appreciate that.

17:37.040 --> 17:40.647
You spin my head right round, right round

17:40.800 --> 17:44.646
When you go down, when you go down, down

17:44.800 --> 17:48.327
You spin my head right round, right round

17:49.360 --> 17:50.486
Do you like sushi?

17:50.680 --> 17:53.251
Have you ever had anyone
eat some off of you?

17:53.440 --> 17:56.125
I promise not to use chopsticks.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.970
Are you still using that line?

18:00.280 --> 18:04.808
- Well, it looks like I scared her off.
- Oh, it's all right. She's vegan anyway. Ha, ha.

18:04.960 --> 18:08.681
What are you doing here? I heard you decided
to go corporate in San Francisco...

18:08.880 --> 18:11.531
...instead of saving the
world in Starling City.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.041
I realized that maybe the world
can't be saved.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.766
- What is it?
- I just don't believe who's here.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.490
Queen.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.843
She's amazin', she's blazin'
Hotter than Cajun

18:25.040 --> 18:26.849
Girl, won't you move a little closer?

18:27.360 --> 18:30.091
I thought I told you this
party is 21 and over.

18:30.280 --> 18:33.204
No worries, I came prepared. Fake ID.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.651
Laurel, how are you?

18:35.880 --> 18:37.291
I'm handling.

18:37.480 --> 18:40.290
- How's school?
- Straight-A student.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.083
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

18:43.280 --> 18:45.726
Nonalcoholic, I swear.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.166
Queenie.

18:49.480 --> 18:53.041
- Isn't this past your bedtime?
- Maybe I need something to keep me awake.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.366
You holding?

19:13.600 --> 19:16.410
- Stay away from Thea Queen.
- Who the hell do you think...?

19:17.600 --> 19:19.364
Holy crap.

19:19.640 --> 19:22.007
You're Oliver Queen.
You're supposed to be dead.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.370
People are gonna lose their minds.

19:25.160 --> 19:27.686
Stay away from my sister.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.210
How'd you like to be dead again?

19:49.400 --> 19:51.448
How many people are in this prison?

19:51.640 --> 19:54.610
You know, maybe there's somebody
we could call for help?

19:54.800 --> 19:57.770
Well, Slade killed the guard.
There's one other inmate.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.206
He's not gonna be helpful.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.721
Then how are we supposed
to get out of here?

20:01.880 --> 20:05.089
This is a Chinese prison retrofitted
by eight A.R.G.U.S. technicians.

20:05.280 --> 20:06.964
There is no getting out of here.

20:07.160 --> 20:10.767
So we're just supposed to sit here
and starve to death? That's your plan?

20:11.760 --> 20:13.285
I am working on a plan.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.409
- What did he mean?
- What?

20:18.600 --> 20:21.683
Wilson, when he said that you were still
hiding something.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.690
- He's insane.
- Yeah, I picked up on that.

20:24.880 --> 20:27.645
I also picked up on how you reacted
when he said...

20:27.840 --> 20:31.083
...that you were keeping secrets from me.

20:32.480 --> 20:33.811
Was he telling the truth?

20:35.360 --> 20:37.522
I don't think that this is the right time.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.802
Actually, I think time is something
that we have a lot of right now.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.847
- Why didn't you tell me about Sara?
- Come on, Thea.

20:46.040 --> 20:50.045
Now that I know about your secret,
everything has become a whole lot clearer.

20:50.760 --> 20:53.331
And I can tell when you're hiding
something from me.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.369
Like you are doing right now.

20:55.600 --> 21:01.084
So, what is it gonna take for you to stop
treating me like this tiny fragile little object?

21:02.760 --> 21:03.886
Tiny?

21:06.040 --> 21:07.201
What?

21:07.400 --> 21:09.880
This prison. These...

21:10.760 --> 21:14.242
...cells, they were made for men.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.844
Fully grown men. Come here.

21:27.800 --> 21:30.724
I can't... Never thought I would wish
for longer arms.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.400
There's a way that we can do it.

21:33.880 --> 21:34.961
But it's gonna hurt.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.127
Just do it.

21:41.600 --> 21:42.726
Okay.

21:42.880 --> 21:45.406
On three. One.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.410
Two. Three.

21:51.720 --> 21:54.087
- You okay?
- I, uh...

21:56.080 --> 21:57.764
All right.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.201
That's good.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.681
Come on.

22:31.080 --> 22:33.526
Malcolm would've told Slade
about the plane we used.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.370
That's how he plans to get back.

22:39.280 --> 22:40.930
No, I didn't...

22:43.640 --> 22:45.130
- Queen?
- What?

22:45.320 --> 22:46.651
Anybody see who Peter Panned him?

22:46.880 --> 22:49.486
Witnesses saw someone head upstairs
before it happened.

22:49.720 --> 22:52.166
Male. White or Hispanic. Twenty to 30s.

22:52.920 --> 22:54.081
That narrows it down.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.927
Maybe it's a vigilante doing some
public service.

22:57.080 --> 22:58.809
Heh. Sure.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.606
- Thea, right?
- Yeah?

23:04.800 --> 23:07.929
- Aren't you young to be at a party like this?
- I invited her.

23:08.720 --> 23:13.567
Oh. Well, you spoiled billionaires sure
know how to throw yourselves a party.

23:14.120 --> 23:17.169
You got underage girls, drug dealers.
You got dead drug dealers.

23:17.360 --> 23:20.284
If I'd known, he never would
have made it past the front gate.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.927
- We had a lot of crashers here tonight.
- Yeah, right. I can see that.

23:24.120 --> 23:25.326
What are you doing here?

23:26.120 --> 23:28.088
They asked us to stay and give statements.

23:28.280 --> 23:31.489
- No. I mean at this douche bag's party.
- Tommy, I'm sorry.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.848
Wow. You really have a thing
for rich bad boys.

23:34.320 --> 23:38.405
You'd think one of them getting your sister
killed would have gotten you cured of that.

23:38.640 --> 23:40.290
Dad.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.051
What about you, sweetheart?

23:42.240 --> 23:46.370
Funny, can't figure out if you're following
in your brother's footsteps or my daughter's.

23:46.520 --> 23:49.046
- That is enough.
- Just observing how one boat trip...

23:49.280 --> 23:52.284
- ...can turn everyone's life to crap.
- No, that is enough.

23:52.440 --> 23:56.240
- We're not doing this.
- We're leaving. Right now.

23:59.560 --> 24:00.846
Well, thank you for that.

24:01.080 --> 24:03.526
- I'm sorry, was I embarrassing you?
- No.

24:03.720 --> 24:06.564
- Yourself.
- At least I know who I am.

24:06.760 --> 24:08.285
I'm not becoming someone I'm not.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.966
Hanging around with billionaire playboys
like some gold digger.

24:11.160 --> 24:13.481
Taking on a sellout job in San Francisco.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.206
Is that what this is about?

24:16.360 --> 24:18.681
When Sara died,
you wanted to go to law school...

24:18.880 --> 24:21.690
...because you wanted
to make the world a better place.

24:22.080 --> 24:25.402
Wethersby Posner is one of the most
prestigious firms in the country.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.886
You wanted to help people.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.888
All you'd be doing is helping fat cats.

24:30.080 --> 24:33.721
This sermon would have a bit more credibility
if you weren't so lit right now.

24:33.920 --> 24:38.005
Well, I don't need to be sober
to see what you're doing with your life.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.527
I just wish you could too.

24:44.320 --> 24:45.446
What were you thinking?

24:45.640 --> 24:48.484
- Anyone at that party could have seen you.
- Yeah, I pulled...

24:48.680 --> 24:50.489
...the hoodie down to cover my face.

24:50.680 --> 24:53.206
That wouldn't work even if you
smeared greasepaint on your face.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.761
So, what, you came to chastise me
at gunpoint?

24:55.960 --> 24:58.088
We got the auction location
from the scraper program.

24:58.280 --> 25:01.363
Kang is using a defunct factory
owned by your family's company.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.771
I don't care. I'm done with the mission.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.604
- Oliver.
- Coming back here, Maseo...

25:06.760 --> 25:09.411
...has shown me all the wreckage
that I have left behind.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.608
If I go with you tonight
and I get killed...

25:11.800 --> 25:15.930
...then I lose any chance I've ever had
of fixing all of the things that I broke.

25:16.120 --> 25:18.691
You don't have that chance.
Waller will kill your...

25:18.880 --> 25:21.611
My family is resourceful.
We have connections in the media.

25:21.800 --> 25:25.202
There has to be a way to shelter us
from whatever Waller does.

25:25.880 --> 25:29.601
Look, Oliver, if you want redemption...

25:29.800 --> 25:32.690
...start with the lives Chien Na Wei's
bio weapon could end.

25:32.920 --> 25:34.331
These people are strangers to me.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.449
These people...

25:37.880 --> 25:39.564
...they're my friends and my family.

25:39.800 --> 25:42.724
And they would be ashamed
of the selfish choice you're making.

25:42.920 --> 25:44.843
They're already ashamed of me.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.650
Good bye, Maseo.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.248
Hey, wait. I think I found a path.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.807
Thea. Stop!

26:11.560 --> 26:12.607
Oh, my God.

26:12.840 --> 26:15.286
- What the hell was that?
- It was a booby trap.

26:15.480 --> 26:17.642
What kind of psycho
would put that thing there?

26:19.120 --> 26:21.202
- Me.
- Oh, God.

26:23.600 --> 26:25.602
Slade's gonna be at the plane.
We need to move.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.882
No, we need to rest.
Just a few minutes, okay?

26:28.080 --> 26:32.130
- Slade gets to...
- He will kill us if you end up passing out.

26:32.360 --> 26:35.204
Okay, okay. Okay, a couple of minutes.

26:40.880 --> 26:42.530
Why didn't you tell me about Sara?

26:43.240 --> 26:44.287
Oh, come on.

26:44.480 --> 26:46.881
Every time I bring her up,
you end up evading it.

26:47.120 --> 26:50.761
Because this isn't the time.
We just need to focus.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.331
Well, I'm not, okay?

26:53.520 --> 26:56.171
Knowing that you're keeping something
from me again...

26:56.960 --> 27:00.567
...it's keeping me everything
but focused right now.

27:01.200 --> 27:03.521
- So tell me.
- Malcolm killed Sara.

27:04.960 --> 27:08.328
No, no. He was in Corto Maltese
with me, okay?

27:08.560 --> 27:10.085
He didn't kill her directly.

27:11.280 --> 27:12.805
He used someone.

27:13.480 --> 27:16.370
He put them under the influence of a drug.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.128
So she wouldn't know what she was doing.

27:21.360 --> 27:22.521
She?

27:24.320 --> 27:25.810
She who?

27:31.600 --> 27:33.090
You killed Sara.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.970
Oh, God. Oh, God.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.883
No, Sara... No, she...

27:47.080 --> 27:48.127
She was my friend.

27:49.200 --> 27:52.283
- How could you not tell me?
- Because you weren't you.

27:53.080 --> 27:54.241
Oh, God.

27:54.480 --> 27:58.201
You had no control over your actions.
You cannot blame yourself.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.522
You were right about Malcolm, okay?

28:00.720 --> 28:03.246
He doesn't love me.

28:03.440 --> 28:04.930
- I'm an idiot.
- No, you're not.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.766
This whole thing with Lian Yu.

28:07.960 --> 28:12.329
This is ridiculous,
and what the hell are we even doing here?

28:14.120 --> 28:17.647
I ask myself the very same question.

28:18.920 --> 28:22.003
Over and over.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.043
Slade.

28:24.520 --> 28:25.931
Don't.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.530
Oh, yeah.

28:31.720 --> 28:33.006
You've come a long way.

29:12.360 --> 29:15.523
I'm here to make good with my promise, kid.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.650
Hello, Oliver.

30:15.840 --> 30:20.164
Well, I told myself I was recording
this message in case I died suddenly but...

30:20.640 --> 30:24.531
I wonder if it isn't just easier to say
what I have to say with a video camera.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.643
I'm not the man you think I am, Oliver.

30:26.880 --> 30:29.167
I didn't save our city. I failed it.

30:29.360 --> 30:33.445
I did something terrible,
and in my efforts to make it right...

30:33.680 --> 30:38.163
...I ignored my conscience
and made alliances with terrible people.

30:38.360 --> 30:40.408
There's a book.

30:40.600 --> 30:43.490
Book with a list of all their names.
And with these people...

30:43.680 --> 30:46.490
I always told myself
that everything I did...

30:47.760 --> 30:49.922
...I did for my family.

30:51.400 --> 30:52.731
That's a lie.

30:52.920 --> 30:55.526
Because what good is a family...

30:55.720 --> 30:57.051
...without a soul?

30:57.240 --> 30:59.561
You can right my wrongs.

31:01.400 --> 31:02.925
You...

31:03.120 --> 31:05.441
...can be better than I was.

31:07.240 --> 31:10.483
You can save this city.

31:12.560 --> 31:13.925
I love you.

31:29.400 --> 31:33.769
Thank you all for coming.
I promise that for one of you...

31:33.960 --> 31:35.530
...it'll be well worth your time.

31:38.600 --> 31:39.931
You've read the briefing.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.283
With the proper resources...

31:42.760 --> 31:44.967
...you can own...

31:45.160 --> 31:47.083
...Armageddon.

31:49.760 --> 31:53.685
The bidding will begin at $50 million.

31:56.520 --> 31:57.601
Fifty-five?

31:58.720 --> 32:00.722
Do I hear 60?

32:20.600 --> 32:23.843
I have $60 million.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.809
Going once.

32:26.040 --> 32:27.929
Going twice.

32:28.120 --> 32:29.246
Ninety million.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.807
Anyone care to make it an even hundred?

32:37.920 --> 32:39.684
Just a moment.

32:40.440 --> 32:41.965
I don't like uninvited guests.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.729
I'm sorry I'm late.

32:54.920 --> 32:57.366
Actually, you arrived right on time.

32:57.800 --> 32:58.926
Let's go.

33:01.680 --> 33:02.841
Make the call.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.445
Find me the Yamashiros.

33:04.640 --> 33:05.971
They die tonight.

33:33.600 --> 33:34.965
You have a choice to make.

33:37.160 --> 33:40.642
- What choice?
- Whether or not you wanna keep your hand.

33:44.160 --> 33:47.687
- Come on, then. You've earned it.
- Thea, don't.

33:47.920 --> 33:51.447
- He killed Morn.
- And he will continue to pay for his crimes.

33:51.640 --> 33:53.802
But not like this.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.200
You're not a killer.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.927
- You tell that to Sara.
- What happened to Sara is not on you.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.009
What happens to him is.

34:01.880 --> 34:03.769
All this is what Malcolm wanted.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.291
He freed Slade...

34:05.520 --> 34:08.000
...to prove that we're killers
because he wants you...

34:08.199 --> 34:09.725
...to be just like him.

34:11.960 --> 34:13.803
You gotta prove to him that you're not.

34:22.880 --> 34:23.927
A flesh wound.

34:24.679 --> 34:28.446
You're clearly not the killer
that your brother is, Thea.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.731
Yeah, I wish that were true.

34:39.280 --> 34:42.045
- She's lost, your sister.
- No, she's not.

34:42.719 --> 34:45.121
You can see it in her eyes.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.243
She's been touched by darkness.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.530
Was it Merlyn?

34:50.719 --> 34:53.451
He's an interesting man to do that
to his own daughter.

34:54.719 --> 34:57.405
So now you've lost your father...

34:57.600 --> 35:01.446
...your mother and now your little sister.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.085
How's the girl with the glasses?

35:06.480 --> 35:09.529
What's her name? Felicity.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.967
How many people can Oliver Queen lose...

35:20.160 --> 35:23.209
...before there is no more Oliver Queen?

35:38.640 --> 35:41.849
Thanks for the trip home.
Have a nice flight back to Hong Kong.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.566
I'm afraid it's not that simple, Mr. Queen.

35:44.760 --> 35:46.683
The hell it's not. You have the Omega.

35:46.880 --> 35:49.565
You have Chien Na Wei. It's over.

35:49.760 --> 35:53.731
I'm sorry to say
that's not up to either one of us.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.130
This him?

36:07.800 --> 36:09.768
General Matthew Shrieve.

36:12.280 --> 36:15.648
You've done your country
quite a service today, Mr. Queen.

36:16.160 --> 36:19.164
That said, I've got some news
you're not gonna wanna hear.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.687
Well, general, I'm used to that by now.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.809
We're gonna need to debrief you.

36:25.160 --> 36:26.491
Back in China.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.407
But once that's accomplished...

36:30.600 --> 36:33.080
...and the Omega secured...

36:33.280 --> 36:36.204
...I'll make sure you go any place
in the world you wanna go.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.326
Sound fair?

36:43.360 --> 36:44.407
Yeah.

36:51.680 --> 36:53.409
Tommy Merlyn.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.051
Are you stalking me?

36:55.240 --> 36:56.924
Just checking on you.

36:57.120 --> 37:00.602
Things with your father seemed, uh...
They seemed tense.

37:02.760 --> 37:06.446
Your roommate told me you were taking
a job here. I said that couldn't be true.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.927
That you were going to work
for a white-shoe firm.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.324
Ah. I Was.

37:11.520 --> 37:14.524
Then someone reminded me
why I became a lawyer in the first place.

37:15.520 --> 37:17.363
You wanna tell me about it over dinner?

37:17.520 --> 37:19.090
Hey-eY'eY-.

37:19.240 --> 37:21.322
It is just dinner.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.844
How many girls have you used
those three little words with?

37:25.040 --> 37:28.089
Those are the only three
little words I say.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.520
Fine. Just dinner.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.644
- Let's go.
- Maybe drinks?

37:36.520 --> 37:38.807
- Maybe.
- Okay.

38:01.360 --> 38:02.441
Dad.

38:04.360 --> 38:08.126
- I didn't know that you were gonna be here.
- Where else would I be?

38:08.440 --> 38:11.808
Gotta figure out a way
to tell your mom about this.

38:13.480 --> 38:14.891
Um...

38:15.960 --> 38:17.450
She already knows.

38:20.040 --> 38:22.202
You weren't worried
about her heart giving out.

38:23.200 --> 38:25.771
If you were gonna drink that,
you would have done it by now.

38:25.960 --> 38:27.962
Really?

38:28.200 --> 38:32.569
What, you gonna go get your mask and your
billy club and take it away from me, huh?

38:32.760 --> 38:34.285
- Black Canary.
- Dad.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.847
When does your shift start?
Shouldn't you be running around?

38:37.080 --> 38:38.127
H9)'-

38:38.320 --> 38:41.403
Do you remember when I was gonna take
that corporate job?

38:41.600 --> 38:42.931
You remember what you said?

38:43.920 --> 38:47.561
You were mad because I wasn't choosing a
life where I was going to help people.

38:48.320 --> 38:49.970
It's like you knew...

38:50.160 --> 38:52.401
...already, even then.

38:52.640 --> 38:55.689
You knew that my life was always headed
towards that mask.

38:55.880 --> 38:58.531
You think that's what
I'm all torn up about?

39:02.800 --> 39:05.326
The reason why I wanna
open up this bottle...

39:05.520 --> 39:08.364
...I wanna crawl inside,
is because of what you did to us.

39:08.720 --> 39:10.609
I love your sister, I love your mom.

39:10.800 --> 39:13.929
So much like each other, you know,
these wild spirits.

39:14.160 --> 39:17.642
But you and I, we had something.
Because we were the ones who were alike.

39:17.840 --> 39:21.845
And we had a trust, we had a bond,
and you broke it.

39:22.080 --> 39:24.128
And, I don't know...

39:24.320 --> 39:26.129
...how you could do that to us.

39:28.320 --> 39:30.800
But I'm gonna survive this.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.650
And what I got is my baby girl.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.729
What you've done...

39:38.280 --> 39:40.328
I don't know how I'm gonna live
through this.

39:40.560 --> 39:44.246
- Daddy, I think we should go to a meeting.
- Yeah.

39:46.080 --> 39:48.731
I'll go to the one on Broxton.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.251
You go to the one on Fourth.

40:15.960 --> 40:17.166
I need a shower.

40:17.360 --> 40:19.761
I need 1O showers.

40:20.680 --> 40:22.842
- Thea.
- I'm fine.

40:23.040 --> 40:26.203
I would be really, really worried
if that were true.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.568
What do you wanna hear?

40:29.280 --> 40:30.930
Nothing.

40:31.720 --> 40:35.850
And I don't want you to tell anyone
about this, especially Laurel.

40:36.360 --> 40:37.407
And why is that?

40:37.600 --> 40:41.730
Because she loves you like a sister,
and it would hurt the both of you too much.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.845
Does she know about Malcolm?

40:48.040 --> 40:49.565
No.

40:50.840 --> 40:53.525
No, that would complicate things...

40:54.000 --> 40:57.891
...and despite everything
that he has done...

40:58.680 --> 40:59.966
...we still need him.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.611
I agree.

41:02.800 --> 41:07.203
I guess A.R.G.U.S. is looking for a few
guards to volunteer for island duty.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.405
You almost got us killed.

41:12.600 --> 41:16.650
I had more faith in you and my daughter
than you obviously have for yourselves.

41:16.840 --> 41:20.561
- How could you do that?
- To challenge you, see if you both could work...

41:20.760 --> 41:22.603
How could you make me kill a friend?

41:23.360 --> 41:25.203
He should not have told you that.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.731
I trusted you.

41:27.680 --> 41:31.207
I let you into my life.

41:33.320 --> 41:35.049
How could you have done this to me?

41:35.240 --> 41:37.686
Because you are my daughter
and I care about you.

41:37.880 --> 41:38.961
God, that's sick.

41:39.160 --> 41:40.924
And not even remotely true.

41:41.120 --> 41:44.602
You do not understand the danger we face
from Ra's al Ghul.

41:44.800 --> 41:48.327
Just stop. Stop using him as an excuse.

41:48.880 --> 41:51.850
The only person that I'm afraid of
right now is you.

41:52.040 --> 41:53.963
- Please do not do this.
- Just stop.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.970
I will work with you to stop Ra's.

41:58.200 --> 42:00.771
Because that's what my brother says
we need to do.

42:00.960 --> 42:03.964
So I will be your student.

42:04.200 --> 42:06.282
I'll be your partner.

42:07.120 --> 42:10.329
Even if I have to, I will be your soldier.

42:11.880 --> 42:14.963
But never again will I be your daughter.
