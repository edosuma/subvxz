WEBVTT

00:03.103 --> 00:06.212
So your visits with Olivia
have been going well?

00:06.298 --> 00:09.817
Um, y-yeah, although,
she seems more interested

00:09.818 --> 00:12.480
in biting her fingernails than
she does in talking to us.

00:12.481 --> 00:15.180
Yeah, she was a little nervous.
Mm. When a child finds out

00:15.181 --> 00:17.901
there's a real possibility
they've found a home,

00:18.158 --> 00:20.372
it can trigger a lot of anxiety.

00:20.373 --> 00:23.733
Olivia has been in the
system for a long time.

00:23.734 --> 00:25.981
It's hard for her to
believe in happy endings.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.345
So she's meeting us here?

00:27.346 --> 00:29.229
Yeah, she's on her way in.
I brought trail mix.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.932
She likes candy better, but,
you know, sugar. Whew. Right.

00:31.933 --> 00:34.517
Look at you guys, already
thinking like parents. Yeah.

00:34.518 --> 00:36.336
Does she know about the
weekend visits yet?

00:36.337 --> 00:40.098
In theory, but I think that
we should choose a date today.

00:40.205 --> 00:42.645
Okay, great. We've had
our niece staying with us

00:42.646 --> 00:43.816
while my sister's out of town,

00:43.817 --> 00:45.948
so she's been helping us
get Olivia's room ready.

00:45.949 --> 00:47.310
How nice. Yeah.

00:48.077 --> 00:49.740
Olivia. Hi, Olivia.

00:49.741 --> 00:51.697
Hi. Would you like
to sit down, Olivia?

00:51.698 --> 00:54.485
No, are you guys gonna ask me
to spend the weekend with you?

00:54.689 --> 00:57.872
'Cause I got stuff to do.
Well, is there any way

00:57.873 --> 01:01.020
that maybe you can do
that stuff at our place?

01:01.062 --> 01:01.756
Do you have a TV?

01:01.757 --> 01:05.426
We do, with cable. And, uh,
thousands of movie channels.

01:06.502 --> 01:07.484
I guess I could do that.

01:07.485 --> 01:08.749
How's next weekend?

01:09.606 --> 01:10.553
Great.

01:10.805 --> 01:11.841
Perfect.

01:13.602 --> 01:14.596
Sure.

01:21.565 --> 01:23.472
Okay, I am off to Wexley.

01:23.473 --> 01:24.694
I'm just gonna stop by my office

01:24.695 --> 01:26.496
and make sure that
I have everything,

01:26.497 --> 01:29.464
and then I'm probably
gonna do a few errands...

01:29.465 --> 01:31.885
And are you sure that you're okay

01:31.886 --> 01:32.912
taking care of Evan?

01:32.913 --> 01:34.839
Because I promise you,
once he wakes up,

01:34.840 --> 01:37.252
you are never gonna
get any reading done.

01:37.253 --> 01:38.540
I'd welcome the interruption.

01:38.541 --> 01:42.013
Melville just spent
way too many pages

01:42.014 --> 01:43.361
describing the
length of the whale.

01:43.362 --> 01:45.473
Oh. How long is it?

01:45.474 --> 01:49.152
It's, um... whew.
It's about 50 pages.

01:49.646 --> 01:50.717
Ba-doomp.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.442
You are very funny.

01:52.443 --> 01:53.389
Uh-huh.

01:55.014 --> 01:56.069
So...

01:58.428 --> 01:59.563
You gonna miss teaching?

02:00.577 --> 02:03.278
Um... yeah, yeah.

02:03.279 --> 02:06.205
It was a good semester.
I-I met a guy.

02:06.206 --> 02:06.741
Mm.

02:06.742 --> 02:08.005
I taught a class,

02:08.006 --> 02:10.469
and... it was great.

02:11.317 --> 02:13.494
Well, just think. You know,
now that the semester's over,

02:13.573 --> 02:16.217
you can spend a lot more
time with that guy you met.

02:17.926 --> 02:19.889
Yeah. Slow around the corner!
Slow, slow, slow.

02:19.896 --> 02:21.095
It's fine. It's fine. Whoa,

02:21.096 --> 02:23.223
whoa, Kevin. Slow down.
It's slipping.

02:23.224 --> 02:25.733
Saul, Saul, don't! You'll throw
your back out. Saul, I got it.

02:25.734 --> 02:27.781
Just get the keys.
Nobody ever lets me do anything!

02:28.185 --> 02:29.848
Why did we have to get this now?

02:30.078 --> 02:33.109
Because I told you, one day,
Olivia will need a desk.

02:33.110 --> 02:34.624
Yeah, but this isn't a desk.

02:34.625 --> 02:36.606
It's a box with pieces
of a desk in it.

02:36.607 --> 02:38.377
And guess who's gonna
have to assemble it. Who?

02:38.378 --> 02:40.777
Me. Okay, I want to meet Olivia.
When am I gonna meet my niece?

02:40.778 --> 02:41.921
It's weekends for a while.

02:41.922 --> 02:43.629
She has to transition
into living with us.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.591
Oh, Saul, I have some things
I wanted to get rid of.

02:45.592 --> 02:47.345
I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to donate them

02:47.346 --> 02:49.634
to the gay and lesbian center.
No problem. I'd be happy to,

02:49.635 --> 02:51.164
except I'm not
volunteering there anymore.

02:51.165 --> 02:53.348
Why not? Did homophobia
end without my knowledge?

02:53.349 --> 02:55.781
No. I found out that
Jonathan works there.

02:55.793 --> 02:56.666
Oh, I thought you guys talked.

02:56.667 --> 02:57.993
We did. I told him
that he probably

02:57.994 --> 03:01.625
gave me H.I.V. in the '80s.
It was a very nice chat. Ow.

03:01.626 --> 03:04.316
Hi, sweetheart. Hi.

03:04.329 --> 03:07.208
Hi. What are you guys doing home?

03:08.079 --> 03:09.848
We live here.
How's your homework coming?

03:09.849 --> 03:13.139
It's good. Um, I'm doing
an essay on Anne Frank.

03:13.140 --> 03:13.824
Ooh.

03:13.825 --> 03:16.033
But I-I could really use a break.

03:16.127 --> 03:18.797
I'd love to take a walk.
Do you guys want to take a walk?

03:19.075 --> 03:20.094
Where?

03:20.269 --> 03:21.308
Outside.

03:21.309 --> 03:23.761
Paige, we live in L.A.
no one's ever willingly

03:23.808 --> 03:24.557
walked around the block

03:24.558 --> 03:26.765
to talk about anything.
I do it all the time.

03:27.116 --> 03:29.006
See? What's going on?
Is everything all right?

03:30.387 --> 03:33.361
Yeah. I've just been a
little cooped up. That's all.

03:34.887 --> 03:36.180
Is someone hiding back there?

03:37.254 --> 03:38.096
Yes.

03:38.097 --> 03:40.179
It's not Anne Frank, is it?

03:42.366 --> 03:44.382
Whoever is in there
can come on out.

03:51.694 --> 03:52.654
Hey.

03:56.158 --> 03:57.991
Hi. How's it going?

03:57.992 --> 03:59.674
Great. Really great.

03:59.813 --> 04:02.468
I'm sorry I'm late.
The 5 was like a parking lot.

04:02.669 --> 04:04.029
So where is she?

04:04.185 --> 04:05.978
Same place she was
when I called you.

04:06.038 --> 04:07.833
She's refusing to pack.

04:08.060 --> 04:11.166
Would you please not talk
about me like I wasn't here?

04:11.253 --> 04:12.260
Hi, Holly.

04:12.750 --> 04:14.593
I don't know what
you're doing here, Nora.

04:14.594 --> 04:15.936
She's here to help.

04:16.793 --> 04:18.958
We're supposed to take
the red-eye out tonight.

04:19.110 --> 04:20.500
We've got a car coming in an hour.

04:20.500 --> 04:21.985
Well, why don't you wait
and go in the morning?

04:21.986 --> 04:23.801
No, I can't.
I have to leave tonight.

04:23.802 --> 04:27.436
I have my first class tomorrow.
I told you, you should just go.

04:27.437 --> 04:29.800
Holly, I am not gonna go
to New York without you.

04:29.801 --> 04:32.284
Okay, then you're gonna
miss your first class.

04:32.285 --> 04:34.613
Holly, I don't understand.
When I talked to you last week,

04:34.614 --> 04:37.836
you were so excited about all of this.
No, I was excited for him

04:37.837 --> 04:39.604
because it's what he wants to do.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.793
He wants to move back
to New York again

04:41.794 --> 04:43.506
and teach cinematography.

04:44.921 --> 04:47.945
But it's all just
happening too fast.

04:48.277 --> 04:49.558
I'm not ready.

04:50.838 --> 04:51.963
How can I help?

04:52.906 --> 04:53.855
Well, you can get her

04:53.856 --> 04:55.456
to move these boxes
into the garage...

04:55.457 --> 04:58.064
No, no. I haven't
gone through them yet.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.229
Holly, we're moving.
We told the tenants

05:00.230 --> 05:02.727
that we would store these
boxes in the garage.

05:02.728 --> 05:05.963
No, you promised them.
I didn't even meet them.

05:06.068 --> 05:10.120
There are 30 years of
my life in these boxes,

05:10.121 --> 05:12.697
25 of which I don't even remember.

05:14.053 --> 05:15.444
I'm sorry,

05:15.621 --> 05:17.842
but you just have to
give me more time.

05:21.968 --> 05:23.842
You know, Nora, I'm worried
that if she doesn't come now,

05:23.843 --> 05:25.252
she's never gonna come.

05:25.601 --> 05:26.905
And Rebecca...

05:27.414 --> 05:29.321
Rebecca's supposed to
pick us up at the airport.

05:29.322 --> 05:30.245
She's excited.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.560
She thinks her family's
gonna be together again.

05:32.561 --> 05:33.124
What am I gonna do?

05:33.125 --> 05:35.797
I'm gonna tell her that
her mom isn't gonna come?

05:36.587 --> 05:37.850
Oh, man.

05:41.116 --> 05:42.908
Yeah, hi. This is David Caplan.

05:42.909 --> 05:45.213
I have a car coming
for me in an hour.

05:45.556 --> 05:47.142
Yeah, I'm... I'm afraid that
I'm gonna have to cancel...

05:47.143 --> 05:48.972
No, wait. Wait. Uh, look.
No, it's fine.

05:48.973 --> 05:52.334
Just come as originally planned.
Okay, great. Thanks.

05:52.701 --> 05:54.041
David, look, go.

05:54.042 --> 05:55.514
All right? Just go to the airport.

05:55.515 --> 05:57.585
I will get the boxes
in the garage,

05:57.586 --> 05:59.465
and I will get Holly to New York.

05:59.466 --> 06:01.864
Just give me a few days.
What are you gonna do?

06:02.797 --> 06:04.978
I don't know. I'll...
I'll think of something.

06:05.454 --> 06:06.508
Trust me.

06:09.089 --> 06:10.037
Just...

06:10.548 --> 06:11.557
Trust me.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:20.330 --> 06:23.589
So here's to finally
making time to have dinner

06:23.696 --> 06:24.772
and the symphony.

06:24.773 --> 06:27.416
I've always wanted a night
on the town in my scrubs.

06:27.417 --> 06:29.097
Well, I've always wanted
to take a beautiful woman

06:29.098 --> 06:30.697
out for hot pockets. 
Mmm.

06:31.369 --> 06:33.455
Uh, you know, with how
hard we've been working,

06:33.456 --> 06:35.329
I just tried to do something.

06:35.540 --> 06:37.622
It's great. Thank you.

06:40.464 --> 06:41.047
Annie?

06:41.048 --> 06:43.017
Just on a-a lunch break.

06:43.018 --> 06:45.236
What's... what's going on,
Dr. Karas?

06:45.237 --> 06:48.081
We're investigating an incident
that occurred last week.

06:48.346 --> 06:50.268
Now you were shadowing
a paramedic unit

06:50.269 --> 06:52.701
that responded to
an injury accident?

06:53.161 --> 06:54.856
Uh, yes. I...

06:54.857 --> 06:57.159
Yeah, that was...
that was actually my rig.

06:57.206 --> 06:58.244
Oh. Is there... is there a problem?

06:58.245 --> 07:00.561
Are you Justin Walker? 
Yeah.

07:00.562 --> 07:02.591
It concerns a procedure
that you performed

07:02.592 --> 07:04.965
that might have been ill-advised

07:05.162 --> 07:06.953
and could lead to a suspension.

07:07.997 --> 07:10.204
Um, no, I'm... I'm sorry.
There's a mistake...

07:10.205 --> 07:12.845
You should make your case in
front of the medical board.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.518
Annie, I came to tell you
that we're gonna need

07:14.519 --> 07:18.159
to interview you as a witness.
Uh, yeah, sure.

07:18.160 --> 07:21.345
I believe that's a
violation of fire code.

07:31.009 --> 07:33.201
Oh, great. This is all I need.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.569
You know, you... you shouldn't
even worry about it.

07:35.821 --> 07:36.776
Once they hear what you did,

07:36.777 --> 07:37.752
I mean, you're gonna
be in the clear.

07:37.753 --> 07:39.517
They'll probably give
you a commendation.

07:39.984 --> 07:41.525
A commenda...
Yeah, I don't think he was here

07:41.526 --> 07:43.620
to give me a gold star, Annie.

07:44.013 --> 07:47.788
You know what?
I actually know a doctor here

07:47.789 --> 07:49.588
that's been through
the exact same thing.

07:49.589 --> 07:52.917
I mean... if you're
interested in talking to him,

07:52.918 --> 07:56.716
I mean, I could... Yeah. Yeah.
I-I mean, a-absolutely.

07:56.717 --> 07:58.110
I need all the help I can get.

08:00.217 --> 08:01.943
My God.

08:01.944 --> 08:03.908
You're still here.

08:03.909 --> 08:06.166
Well, I just... I wanted to
make sure you were all right.

08:06.950 --> 08:08.038
No.

08:08.377 --> 08:12.074
You wanted to Nora Walker
me into going to New York.

08:12.466 --> 08:14.017
I had no idea. I'm a verb?

08:14.018 --> 08:17.085
Nora, you are every
part of speech.

08:17.086 --> 08:19.473
Holly, look, I don't
want to verb or... or noun

08:19.474 --> 08:22.636
or adjective you into doing
anything you don't want to do.

08:22.637 --> 08:24.033
No one has the right to do that.

08:24.034 --> 08:26.660
Well, obviously,
David felt differently.

08:26.661 --> 08:29.701
Well, he loves you. He wants
you in New York with him.

08:29.895 --> 08:32.379
But that's no reason to badger
you into doing something

08:32.380 --> 08:34.398
you're just not ready to do.

08:35.677 --> 08:39.629
W-why do I feel there is
some kind of catch here?

08:39.645 --> 08:43.405
No. No. No,
there... there is no catch.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.095
Maybe an idea.

08:46.662 --> 08:47.943
Do you want to hear it?

08:48.870 --> 08:49.829
Sure.

08:50.981 --> 08:52.839
Holly, I think you should stay.

08:52.954 --> 08:55.076
Oh, right. The renters
would love that...

08:55.077 --> 08:57.412
Having a crazy lady
living in their kitchen.

08:57.413 --> 08:58.695
No, not here.

08:58.897 --> 09:01.875
I mean with me in my house.

09:02.795 --> 09:04.512
Are you serious? Yes.

09:04.513 --> 09:07.009
The two of us living
under one roof?

09:07.010 --> 09:09.906
I've got five empty bedrooms.
You can take your pick.

09:09.907 --> 09:12.232
We can move the boxes
into the garage,

09:12.233 --> 09:14.858
and when you're ready,
and not a moment before,

09:14.870 --> 09:16.196
you can go through them.

09:17.882 --> 09:20.729
Holly, listen,
we have a history together.

09:21.889 --> 09:23.250
We've become friends.

09:24.757 --> 09:27.970
This is just one friend
trying to help another friend.

09:31.708 --> 09:33.240
No, not at all. It's no trouble.

09:33.241 --> 09:34.933
We'll have someone
come by this afternoon

09:34.934 --> 09:36.135
with some more pamphlets.

09:36.768 --> 09:37.747
Yeah.

09:38.898 --> 09:41.260
No, we're... we're...
we're just glad that the students

09:41.261 --> 09:42.957
are... are looking at them, yeah.

09:43.148 --> 09:45.769
Okay. If you need anything else,
why don't you just call?

09:45.850 --> 09:48.556
Okay, yeah. Bye. How's it going?

09:48.557 --> 09:50.057
Great. That was the school nurse.

09:50.058 --> 09:52.557
They need more pamphlets.
Sounds encouraging.

09:52.558 --> 09:54.829
Yeah. But I meant,
how are you doing?

09:55.815 --> 09:59.274
Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.

09:59.275 --> 10:00.260
Incredibly,

10:00.261 --> 10:04.134
I just found out you're volunteering here.
Today's my last day.

10:04.141 --> 10:06.248
My nephew had some things
he wanted to donate,

10:06.249 --> 10:07.656
so I brought them in,

10:07.657 --> 10:09.801
and I figured I'd answer
the phone while I was here.

10:09.853 --> 10:11.293
Oh, I'm sorry you're leaving.

10:12.021 --> 10:14.249
It would've been nice
to see you around.

10:18.417 --> 10:19.506
Saul...

10:20.360 --> 10:22.237
I wish there was
something I could say.

10:22.238 --> 10:23.230
There isn't.

10:25.189 --> 10:26.519
Take care, Jonathan.

10:28.721 --> 10:29.889
Take care, Saul.

10:32.686 --> 10:34.233
And then we grounded her
for the rest of the night.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.388
And I unplugged the wi-fi
so she couldn't get online.

10:36.389 --> 10:37.904
We had dinner, and then we
just worked on Anne Frank.

10:37.905 --> 10:40.640
And that's all. I-I know,
'cause I lost my wallet,

10:40.641 --> 10:42.641
and I was chained to the phone
canceling my credit cards.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.768
I was watching her like a hawk.

10:43.769 --> 10:45.812
I think we're upset because
this happened on our watch.

10:45.813 --> 10:48.483
Yeah, I mean, as guardians, we just...
That's it?

10:48.513 --> 10:50.332
That's why I had to rush
straight here from the airport?

10:50.333 --> 10:52.328
That's why I had to
give a guy 20 bucks

10:52.329 --> 10:53.708
to cut in the taxi line? Well,

10:53.709 --> 10:55.758
we didn't want to
tell you on the phone.

10:56.310 --> 10:57.649
Oh, God. I-I thought

10:57.650 --> 10:59.038
she'd burned the restaurant
down or something.

10:59.039 --> 11:01.043
Oh, well, sorry for overreacting.

11:01.888 --> 11:03.509
No, I-I mean it's...

11:04.162 --> 11:05.165
It's sweet, actually.

11:05.166 --> 11:07.796
Sweet? We found her
hiding a teenage boy

11:07.797 --> 11:09.558
in the guest bedroom, Sarah.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.885
Phillip. Paige has known
him since second grade.

11:12.886 --> 11:16.039
He's always over at our house,
doing homework, hanging out.

11:17.560 --> 11:18.728
I don't think he knows this yet,

11:18.729 --> 11:20.749
but I'm pretty sure
he bats for your team.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.545
Our... Oh. Of course, I will
have a conversation with Paige

11:23.546 --> 11:25.581
about her having somebody
over at your apartment

11:25.582 --> 11:27.380
without your permission. Mm-hmm.

11:27.381 --> 11:29.397
But, um, can I give
you two some...

11:29.845 --> 11:31.104
Parents-to-be advice?

11:31.105 --> 11:33.137
Yeah. Just relax.

11:34.005 --> 11:35.724
Now I am gonna go home
and take a shower.

11:35.725 --> 11:38.212
Uh, S-Sarah,
his name wasn't Phillip.

11:38.213 --> 11:40.217
It was, uh, Sean. S-Sean.

11:40.218 --> 11:42.988
Football player Sean? Maybe.
He was wearing a Jersey.

11:42.989 --> 11:44.917
Yeah, number 17.
You're kidding me.

11:44.918 --> 11:47.276
No. Why didn't you tell
me that on the message?

11:47.277 --> 11:50.188
That's what we've been trying to do.
Oh, I'm gonna kill her.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.545
Or I'm gonna kill him.

11:52.102 --> 11:53.285
I'm gonna kill someone.

12:06.001 --> 12:07.422
Well, I hope you're not thinking

12:07.423 --> 12:09.889
about spending the rest
of the day in here.

12:09.890 --> 12:11.985
No, just resting a little.

12:11.989 --> 12:15.392
Who knew the farmers' market
could be so exhausting?

12:15.393 --> 12:18.119
I know it was early,
but I hate it when the produce

12:18.120 --> 12:19.957
and the flowers get
all picked over.

12:19.958 --> 12:22.556
Oh, no. It was fun,
watching the vendors

12:22.557 --> 12:25.528
set up their carts in the
cold like that... yeah.

12:25.529 --> 12:27.584
Good thing you brought
that flashlight.

12:27.585 --> 12:28.722
Yeah.

12:29.525 --> 12:30.965
Okay, my friend,

12:31.498 --> 12:33.660
mid-morning cocktail.

12:33.661 --> 12:35.967
Oh. Thatta girl.

12:38.903 --> 12:41.356
Mm. Oh, what is in that?

12:41.357 --> 12:42.622
Beets, carrots,

12:42.677 --> 12:44.226
a little freshly grated ginger.

12:44.490 --> 12:47.259
Good for the circulation.
Helps with glaucoma.

12:47.693 --> 12:49.228
I don't have glaucoma.

12:49.229 --> 12:50.333
Not yet.

12:51.143 --> 12:52.241
Oh. Okay.

12:52.510 --> 12:55.968
We've got 30 minutes to do a
little yoga and stretching

12:55.969 --> 12:57.284
before we leave.

12:57.285 --> 12:59.350
Leave? Where are we going?

12:59.351 --> 13:02.260
There is the most
wonderful exhibit

13:02.261 --> 13:04.204
at the county museum.

13:04.205 --> 13:08.172
It's everyday artifacts
of the aztec empire.

13:08.173 --> 13:10.042
It's dishes and bowls

13:10.043 --> 13:11.425
in corals and earth tones.

13:11.426 --> 13:13.233
Doesn't that sound wonderful?

13:13.610 --> 13:14.296
Riveting.

13:14.297 --> 13:17.201
And that gives us enough
time for a nice long hike.

13:17.202 --> 13:18.209
A hike?

13:18.591 --> 13:20.665
Hike, as in up a hill?

13:20.666 --> 13:23.094
Up a hill and over a ravine,

13:23.095 --> 13:24.361
around a reservoir... oh.

13:24.362 --> 13:26.969
But it helps to get a
little stretching in before.

13:26.970 --> 13:30.489
The chances of that happening
are just about zero.

13:30.568 --> 13:31.884
All right. Well, suit yourself.

13:31.885 --> 13:33.748
But we're leaving
here in 30 minutes.

13:33.749 --> 13:36.197
We have to have time
enough to make dinner.

13:36.336 --> 13:36.901
Dinner?

13:36.902 --> 13:39.320
Yes, I'm teaching you
to make a lasagna

13:39.321 --> 13:41.661
with a lemon-basil marinara,

13:41.677 --> 13:43.124
all from scratch.

13:43.125 --> 13:45.944
There will be no store-bought
pasta for us, missy.

13:45.945 --> 13:47.480
Oh, God, no,

13:47.481 --> 13:50.696
because that would be
sensible and convenient.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.744
Oh, don't be such a party pooper.

13:52.745 --> 13:55.178
I am loving this.
I'm having such a good time.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.542
I love having a roomie.

13:57.646 --> 14:00.069
Come on, one little
downward dog with me.

14:00.070 --> 14:03.144
Let's go. Knock yourself out.

14:04.194 --> 14:07.082
I'm away one week, Paige is
tackling the quarterback.

14:07.083 --> 14:09.728
Well, it looks like our
little Paige is growing up.

14:09.729 --> 14:12.338
Not too fast if I've got
anything to do with it.

14:12.625 --> 14:14.548
Oh, by the way, listen to them

14:14.549 --> 14:16.020
when they say get to
the airport early.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.604
The lines are insane.
And wear really nice underpants,

14:18.605 --> 14:21.532
because those scanners,
they're... they're ridiculous.

14:21.533 --> 14:23.182
I mean, you're naked. Sarah,

14:23.285 --> 14:25.165
I think you just have
naked on the brain.

14:25.166 --> 14:29.005
You wait until Evan is older.
Well, then again, he's a boy.

14:29.539 --> 14:31.303
God, I hope he
sleeps on the plane.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.258
Mm. I remember that one.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.876
Kitty, I think it is really sweet

14:35.877 --> 14:38.454
you're taking Evan to
see Robert's kids. Mm.

14:38.455 --> 14:41.493
But, um... two weeks?

14:41.986 --> 14:43.655
Isn't that a little excessive?

14:43.656 --> 14:46.080
No. No, in fact,
it might even be longer.

14:46.081 --> 14:47.495
It's kind of open-ended.

14:48.149 --> 14:50.388
Open-ended? What do you mean,
open-ended?

14:50.867 --> 14:51.568
Well, there are

14:51.569 --> 14:54.273
a lot of things to do
in Washington, Sarah.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.983
Like what, the Smithsonian?

14:57.984 --> 15:01.148
Yeah, like the Smithsonian,
and... and since I'm there,

15:01.149 --> 15:03.236
I've decided that I'm gonna
take a couple of meetings.

15:03.237 --> 15:05.760
Why would you want to go
back into the snake pit?

15:05.761 --> 15:08.363
Excuse me, but that
snake pit was my life.

15:08.364 --> 15:10.894
Exactly. "Was," past tense.

15:12.493 --> 15:14.447
Have you told mom? Yeah,
she knows I'm going.

15:14.448 --> 15:17.696
For two weeks,
not to restart your old life.

15:18.185 --> 15:19.625
Are you taking Seth?

15:19.905 --> 15:22.195
No. No, I'm not taking Seth.

15:22.196 --> 15:24.952
My... I haven't even told
him that I'm going yet.

15:24.953 --> 15:28.377
I'm confused. I mean,
are you in your right mind?

15:28.378 --> 15:29.610
Do you know what you're doing?

15:30.713 --> 15:31.673
Yeah.

15:32.305 --> 15:33.791
Yeah, I totally
know what I'm doing,

15:33.792 --> 15:37.073
and... and I think that you
should just be happy for me.

15:37.750 --> 15:38.661
Okay.

15:39.881 --> 15:40.857
Thank you.

15:42.186 --> 15:43.651
Well, what's this,
part of the door?

15:43.652 --> 15:46.444
Well, if you'd read the instructions...
No, they make no sense.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.704
Here, Kevin, give that to me.
It's a support piece.

15:48.705 --> 15:50.989
No, I have to learn how
to do stuff like this.

15:50.990 --> 15:52.090
Kevin, there are so many things

15:52.091 --> 15:53.158
we're gonna have to
deal with as parents.

15:53.159 --> 15:55.253
Don't obsess over something I can do.

15:56.629 --> 15:57.717
Fine.

16:00.280 --> 16:01.410
I think this whole Paige thing

16:01.411 --> 16:02.961
has been a real wake-up call.

16:03.084 --> 16:05.425
Yeah, I know. Parenting's
not a day at the beach.

16:05.426 --> 16:07.217
No, but that's exactly how
I've been picturing it,

16:07.218 --> 16:09.877
with beach towels and
cheap little sunglasses

16:09.878 --> 16:11.816
and cute flip-flops.
God. You have it bad.

16:11.817 --> 16:14.028
Well, how have you been picturing it?
Well, the same way,

16:14.029 --> 16:16.873
except for with ballet lessons
and shopping for outfits...

16:16.874 --> 16:19.002
Oh, stop. You're
gonna drive me nuts.

16:23.382 --> 16:24.437
Oh, it's Jill.

16:25.210 --> 16:26.218
Hello.

16:27.539 --> 16:29.004
Oh, that's fantastic.

16:29.005 --> 16:31.244
She found my wallet.
I must have left it there. Oh.

16:33.698 --> 16:34.738
Oh.

16:35.466 --> 16:38.384
Wow. Uh, y-yeah, of course.

16:38.385 --> 16:40.141
We'll be there as
soon as possible.

16:40.225 --> 16:41.378
Thank you.

16:41.630 --> 16:42.512
What is it?

16:44.090 --> 16:46.794
I didn't lose my wallet.
Olivia stole it.

16:47.341 --> 16:48.760
Wh... That's nuts.

16:48.761 --> 16:51.897
Yeah. I guess she picked my
pocket when she hugged me.

16:55.077 --> 16:56.504
This is quite special.

16:56.505 --> 16:57.722
Yes, it is.

16:59.494 --> 17:00.741
Hey. Hi.

17:01.544 --> 17:03.196
Justin, this is Rick.

17:03.197 --> 17:04.599
Rick. Hey, Rick appleton.

17:04.601 --> 17:06.231
Justin Walker. Thank you.
Hey, no problem.

17:06.232 --> 17:08.000
Rick is a cardiology resident,

17:08.001 --> 17:11.492
and he's actually been in Africa
for the past year, right? Yeah.

17:11.493 --> 17:12.300
Ooh. And I return to find

17:12.300 --> 17:14.071
the renegade paramedics
are running wild.

17:14.073 --> 17:15.845
Oh, Rick, come on. Seriously.

17:15.846 --> 17:18.298
He's... he's really worried
about this. I'm kidding.

17:18.965 --> 17:21.175
Why don't you, uh, why don't
you just tell me what happened?

17:21.175 --> 17:23.714
The guy's B.P. was dropping,
his lung collapsed.

17:23.715 --> 17:25.958
You could see the
mediastinal shift and...

17:25.959 --> 17:28.079
And we were losing him.
All right, and at this point,

17:28.080 --> 17:29.311
what was your E.T.A.
to the hospital?

17:29.312 --> 17:33.550
Just ball park is fine. Um, I think it was...
What was it?

17:33.949 --> 17:36.489
Three minutes, and, of course,
you know, when you're dealing

17:36.490 --> 17:37.777
with life and death,
that can be an eternity.

17:37.778 --> 17:40.142
Look, Justin, I, uh, I totally get

17:40.143 --> 17:41.360
that you felt you
had to do something,

17:41.361 --> 17:42.741
but the med board,
they're gonna argue

17:42.742 --> 17:44.960
that when you're that close
to the hospital, the decision

17:44.961 --> 17:47.181
to decompress a tension
pneumothorax was premature.

17:47.182 --> 17:48.708
Uh, well, Rick, wait a second.

17:48.709 --> 17:49.897
If Justin hadn't have done it,

17:49.898 --> 17:51.021
I mean, we would've gotten

17:51.022 --> 17:52.393
to the hospital with a...
Annie, Annie, easy.

17:52.394 --> 17:54.426
All right? I'm just...
I'm here to help.

17:55.631 --> 17:56.429
I don't know if you've noticed,

17:56.430 --> 17:58.197
but she's got kind of
a hair-trigger temper.

17:58.198 --> 17:59.813
Only when people set it off.

18:00.974 --> 18:03.253
Okay, fine. I assume
you've heard about

18:03.254 --> 18:05.562
the, uh, dorm window story.

18:05.563 --> 18:07.004
No. No, no, no, he hasn't.
Dorm win...

18:07.005 --> 18:08.073
We're not telling that story.

18:08.074 --> 18:11.329
So no, stop.
Okay, so you haven't, then.

18:12.109 --> 18:13.513
No, I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

18:13.514 --> 18:15.995
Did you guys go to college
together or something?

18:15.996 --> 18:20.218
Yes, Rick was in med school
while I was an undergrad.

18:20.921 --> 18:25.472
Oh. Um, so what's this...
Dorm window story?

18:25.473 --> 18:26.360
Mm. Well...

18:26.361 --> 18:28.506
You tell it, you die. I'm serious.

18:29.756 --> 18:31.356
Fine, okay.

18:31.357 --> 18:33.572
Why don't you make her
tell you sometime?

18:33.573 --> 18:35.397
It was beautiful. I swear. Mm.

18:37.376 --> 18:39.489
Oh, that's me.
I gotta get outta here.

18:39.533 --> 18:41.702
I will call you later. Okay? Yep.

18:42.078 --> 18:42.921
Bye. Bye.

18:42.922 --> 18:46.568
Hey. No college stories.
I mean it. But thank you.

18:48.674 --> 18:50.768
Dr. Barnes, call 3-7-7...

18:53.192 --> 18:55.851
Well, um... Justin.

18:55.877 --> 18:57.790
Yeah. In these kinds of cases,

18:57.791 --> 19:00.310
it can really help if you have
an advocate in your corner.

19:00.374 --> 19:02.028
If you want, I'll do that for you.

19:02.029 --> 19:03.793
I'll just go in
front of the board,

19:03.794 --> 19:05.361
tell them I think you
did the right thing.

19:05.622 --> 19:07.496
Well, thank you.
I appreciate that.

19:07.497 --> 19:08.457
Oh, it's fine.

19:12.225 --> 19:14.258
So should we be, like,
good cop, bad cop?

19:14.795 --> 19:17.475
The trouble is, I feel more
like hurt and confused cop.

19:17.476 --> 19:19.349
Imagine being that
wounded at 9 years old,

19:19.350 --> 19:20.902
you don't trust anyone.

19:22.713 --> 19:26.178
Olivia, Kevin and Scotty
would like to talk to you.

19:26.565 --> 19:27.963
I'll give you a little privacy.

19:28.008 --> 19:28.841
Thank you.

19:36.037 --> 19:37.728
I guess you know why
we want to talk to you.

19:37.729 --> 19:38.757
Because I stole your wallet,

19:38.758 --> 19:40.349
and you don't want
to see me anymore.

19:40.350 --> 19:41.901
No, we do want to see you again,

19:41.902 --> 19:44.029
but we do have to talk
about what you did.

19:47.085 --> 19:48.355
Do you want to tell
us why you took it?

19:48.356 --> 19:50.147
It's fun to do bad things.

19:50.838 --> 19:53.317
Okay, so you know what you
did was bad. Can I go now?

19:53.318 --> 19:55.918
No, you can't.
Olivia, we have to know

19:55.957 --> 19:57.634
that you won't do
anything like this again.

19:57.635 --> 20:01.209
You're not my parents.
No, we're not your parents yet.

20:01.210 --> 20:02.092
But we're going to be.

20:02.093 --> 20:04.344
I don't want you guys
to be my parents.

20:05.606 --> 20:08.642
Ol-Olivia, um...
Why don't you tell us

20:08.643 --> 20:09.992
why it is you're so upset with us?

20:09.993 --> 20:12.297
You don't understand anything
because you're stupid.

20:12.298 --> 20:13.835
Just leave me alone, okay?

20:13.836 --> 20:15.829
I'm telling Jill that I don't
want to be with you guys

20:15.830 --> 20:17.409
for a weekend or ever.

20:17.410 --> 20:19.204
Olivi... Olivia.

20:22.963 --> 20:24.463
So now what do we do?

20:25.647 --> 20:26.671
I don't know.

20:35.000 --> 20:35.529
Hi.

20:35.530 --> 20:36.480
Hi.

20:37.268 --> 20:38.642
How was study group?

20:39.742 --> 20:40.780
It was fine.

20:42.330 --> 20:43.015
How was your trip?

20:43.016 --> 20:43.891
Oh, it was good,

20:44.577 --> 20:45.964
very productive.

20:47.313 --> 20:49.188
And then I got home.

20:51.439 --> 20:52.417
Okay, look,

20:52.558 --> 20:54.521
before you start yelling at me,

20:54.522 --> 20:56.746
will you just... listen?

20:56.747 --> 20:59.172
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

20:59.173 --> 21:01.225
No, that's not how this
is gonna go, Paige.

21:01.226 --> 21:02.832
You're gonna sit down

21:03.174 --> 21:06.448
and you're gonna tell me
all about you and Sean.

21:06.449 --> 21:10.076
And then you and I will decide
on the appropriate punishment.

21:10.077 --> 21:13.160
Why do you automatically assume
I was doing something wrong?

21:13.435 --> 21:16.366
Uh, because you
invited a boy over to

21:16.367 --> 21:18.849
Kevin and Scotty's apartment
without their permission.

21:18.850 --> 21:20.139
You were sneaking around.

21:20.140 --> 21:22.366
You were trying to hide
it from them and from me.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.153
How long has this...

21:27.128 --> 21:28.877
Thing been going on with Sean?

21:32.378 --> 21:33.317
Okay.

21:34.116 --> 21:35.541
Could you tell me

21:35.872 --> 21:39.634
if he has been at the house
when I have not been here?

21:42.172 --> 21:43.195
Oh, great.

21:43.196 --> 21:45.203
You know this is how girls get pregnant...
Mom.

21:45.204 --> 21:47.851
Okay, tell me, please,
what you two have been doing.

21:47.852 --> 21:50.688
You've already decided that I've
done something inappropriate,

21:50.689 --> 21:53.264
so why don't you just
go ahead and punish me?

21:55.178 --> 21:56.389
Cell phone, please.

21:58.835 --> 22:01.360
You are grounded for a week.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.706
Um, this is really unfair.

22:03.707 --> 22:06.528
I would be very
careful if I were you

22:06.529 --> 22:08.059
about making this any worse.

22:31.951 --> 22:32.599
Saul.

22:32.600 --> 22:33.524
Jonathan.

22:35.238 --> 22:37.492
Well, I seem to be seeing
you everywhere these days.

22:37.493 --> 22:39.377
Can I get you a drink? Uh,
listen, sweetheart.

22:39.378 --> 22:41.763
Would... would you just leave
us alone for a second?

22:41.764 --> 22:42.440
Sure.

22:42.441 --> 22:43.150
Thanks.

22:44.584 --> 22:46.758
Look, Jonathan, I don't
know what you want from me.

22:46.759 --> 22:49.567
Whether you want forgiveness
or absolution, I don't know.

22:49.755 --> 22:52.129
Whatever it is,
I can't give it to you.

22:52.130 --> 22:53.055
Do you understand?

22:53.942 --> 22:57.093
Saul, we were friends once.

22:57.127 --> 22:58.836
I just hoped we could be again.

22:58.837 --> 23:01.776
We were friends?
What are you talking about?

23:05.938 --> 23:07.476
Well, I guess

23:08.054 --> 23:10.841
that's not possible under
the circumstances. No.

23:10.842 --> 23:15.191
But you were right.
I-I came here for forgiveness.

23:15.302 --> 23:17.419
But that was all about me.

23:17.744 --> 23:20.456
I pride myself on being a
better person than before,

23:20.457 --> 23:22.793
but... my behavior

23:22.794 --> 23:25.331
has been just as
selfish as it ever was.

23:26.677 --> 23:28.002
I won't bother you again.

23:29.261 --> 23:30.899
Take care, Saul.

23:44.990 --> 23:45.848
Ugh.

23:46.770 --> 23:49.619
Oh, well, I told you not to wear

23:49.620 --> 23:51.631
those cute little shoes hiking.

23:52.096 --> 23:54.838
But think of all the
knitting we got done

23:54.839 --> 23:56.558
while we were waiting
in the emergency room.

23:56.559 --> 24:00.475
No, you were knitting.
I was filling out forms.

24:00.796 --> 24:03.044
Oh... no, no, no, no.

24:03.045 --> 24:05.857
Look, you... you dig
a well in the flour

24:05.858 --> 24:08.107
and then you break
the eggs in the well.

24:08.108 --> 24:10.644
Then you mush it all
together with your fingers,

24:10.645 --> 24:12.081
add just a little bit of water,

24:12.082 --> 24:14.015
otherwise the glutens won't bind.

24:14.016 --> 24:15.205
God, you are a cross

24:15.206 --> 24:17.655
between Martha Stewart
and Joseph Stalin.

24:17.656 --> 24:20.914
Who gives a crap whether
the glutens bind or not?

24:20.915 --> 24:23.141
Ohh, I'll tell you what...

24:23.671 --> 24:25.990
Once you taste that pasta,

24:25.991 --> 24:28.017
you'll be glad you
went the extra mile.

24:28.018 --> 24:29.314
Oh, yeah, that's
just what you said

24:29.315 --> 24:31.024
when we were on the
trail together.

24:31.025 --> 24:33.163
Oh. You know what?

24:34.317 --> 24:37.267
I thought of something fabulous

24:37.268 --> 24:38.391
we can do tomorrow.

24:38.392 --> 24:40.313
Oh, do I want to hear this?

24:40.314 --> 24:42.419
Colonics. 
Colonics?

24:42.420 --> 24:45.637
Yeah, you know, out with the old,
in with the new?

24:45.638 --> 24:47.494
It will make you feel so fresh

24:47.495 --> 24:49.020
and just glad to be alive.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.770
Oh, if I hear any more
positive thinking,

24:51.771 --> 24:54.970
my head is going to explode.
I'm just trying to help you.

24:54.971 --> 24:56.806
Yeah, just like you
help all the people

24:56.807 --> 25:00.114
on your radio show with
your 3-minute sound bites.

25:00.115 --> 25:02.022
I think I really do
help a lot of people.

25:02.023 --> 25:05.692
Yes, until they hang up and
then reality crashes in.

25:05.693 --> 25:08.055
And I am not one of your cases.

25:08.056 --> 25:11.632
Whatever problems I have,
you're not gonna solve them

25:11.633 --> 25:14.542
by teaching me how to make
a zesty marinara sauce

25:14.543 --> 25:17.580
or sticking a garden hose up my...
Holly, Holly, Holly.

25:17.581 --> 25:19.253
Oh, gosh.

25:19.254 --> 25:21.840
I'm not trying to fix you
or solve you. Honestly.

25:21.841 --> 25:23.810
I'm just... I'm
enjoying your company.

25:23.811 --> 25:25.560
And think of how
much fun it would be

25:25.561 --> 25:29.699
if we got to spend every day
together like this. Mm. Okay.

25:29.886 --> 25:32.264
Okay, I-I-I get what
you're doing, Nora.

25:32.265 --> 25:35.153
You're not trying to
help me or cheer me up.

25:35.154 --> 25:37.575
You're trying to drive me crazy

25:37.576 --> 25:39.959
so that I'll go
screaming to New York.

25:39.960 --> 25:42.548
Holly, I don't want
you to do anything

25:42.549 --> 25:44.697
you don't want to do.

25:44.698 --> 25:45.763
I'm outta here.

25:46.619 --> 25:47.454
Where are you going?

25:47.455 --> 25:49.435
Anywhere but here.

25:49.436 --> 25:51.384
Are you gonna be all right? Yes!

25:51.385 --> 25:52.434
Oh.

25:53.789 --> 25:54.552
Oh.

25:58.261 --> 26:00.683
I've never felt so
rejected in my life.

26:00.684 --> 26:01.741
I mean, we talked to Jill,
and technically...

26:01.742 --> 26:04.098
Maybe this is the universe's
way of telling us something.

26:04.099 --> 26:05.159
She can't stop the placement,
but she stole his wallet.

26:05.160 --> 26:07.255
I don't know what to do. We really
have no idea what to do. No.

26:07.256 --> 26:09.536
Are you guys done? No. Are we? No.

26:09.537 --> 26:11.058
I don't know. That's why
we're here, to ask you.

26:11.059 --> 26:12.596
You don't think there
are days like yesterday

26:12.597 --> 26:14.436
where I don't wish I
could give my kids back?

26:14.437 --> 26:15.305
We wouldn't be giving her back,

26:15.306 --> 26:17.127
'cause we don't even have her yet.

26:18.426 --> 26:20.323
Wait, you're seriously
considering...

26:20.324 --> 26:22.809
Yeah, we have to be realistic.
Maybe this isn't the right fit.

26:22.810 --> 26:23.563
I mean, she made it clear,

26:23.564 --> 26:25.824
she did not want to be with us.
Clear schmear.

26:26.675 --> 26:27.830
It's okay to be afraid, you know?

26:27.831 --> 26:29.785
You would be fools if you weren't.

26:29.811 --> 26:33.022
But if you're really not sure
you want Olivia in your lives,

26:33.023 --> 26:34.746
then you should walk away now

26:34.747 --> 26:36.497
before you cause her
any more damage. No,

26:36.498 --> 26:39.104
it's not that we're not sure
that we want her, Sarah.

26:39.105 --> 26:41.286
It's that we don't know
if she wants us. Yeah.

26:41.287 --> 26:42.741
Scotty, she is 9 years old.

26:42.742 --> 26:44.551
She's been let down by
adults her whole life.

26:44.552 --> 26:46.879
She's got no idea what she wants.

26:47.167 --> 26:49.380
Listen, you are gonna
ask her to do things

26:49.381 --> 26:50.037
she doesn't want to do,

26:50.038 --> 26:51.628
you'll say things she
doesn't want to hear,

26:51.629 --> 26:53.887
and you'll make her go places
she doesn't want to go.

26:54.063 --> 26:54.674
And the whole time,

26:54.675 --> 26:57.708
she'll be looking at you with
her eyes full of loathing,

26:57.709 --> 27:00.201
and you'll suck it up
because you will love her.

27:00.664 --> 27:03.148
It's a dance, and I tell you,

27:03.149 --> 27:05.728
it's a dance that you'll be
doing for the next ten years,

27:05.729 --> 27:08.827
but I don't know two other
people who are more willing

27:08.828 --> 27:12.413
and more able to give that
child the home that she needs.

27:14.261 --> 27:16.785
Wow, that was like you
were just channeling Nora.

27:16.786 --> 27:18.936
Well, it's a parent thing.

27:19.625 --> 27:20.500
Hi.

27:21.160 --> 27:21.900
Hi.

27:23.272 --> 27:23.998
Hi.

27:24.873 --> 27:25.911
Paige, do you have something

27:25.912 --> 27:27.638
that you would like
to say to your uncles

27:27.639 --> 27:30.139
before you go upstairs
to finish your homework?

27:33.098 --> 27:36.172
I'm sorry that I had
someone in your apartment

27:36.173 --> 27:37.295
without your permission...

27:38.082 --> 27:40.739
Even though nothing
bad happened. Paige.

27:41.426 --> 27:42.266
I'm sorry.

27:42.495 --> 27:43.978
Thank you, Paige. Thanks.

27:43.979 --> 27:47.095
And just so you guys know,
Sean told me

27:47.096 --> 27:48.013
it was okay to let you know

27:48.014 --> 27:49.930
that he told me in
strict confidence

27:49.931 --> 27:51.714
that he thinks he might be gay,

27:51.715 --> 27:53.961
and he just wanted to
talk to you guys about it.

27:56.860 --> 27:57.747
Sure.

27:57.785 --> 27:58.624
Wait.

27:58.810 --> 28:00.388
Sean thinks he's gay?

28:00.389 --> 28:02.797
I thought Phillip was...

28:03.185 --> 28:04.474
Gay? Yeah.

28:05.273 --> 28:07.289
Uh, no. He has a girlfriend.

28:07.674 --> 28:08.538
He does?

28:09.287 --> 28:10.987
Don't worry. It's not me.

28:12.361 --> 28:13.236
See?

28:13.886 --> 28:15.436
The dance continues.

28:15.923 --> 28:18.305
God, I can't believe
that you're doing this.

28:18.306 --> 28:20.757
I know. I'm... I'm sorry.

28:20.758 --> 28:24.157
I thought you were happy.
I am happy. I am.

28:24.158 --> 28:25.431
But I have to be able to

28:25.432 --> 28:27.363
explore all my options. I...
Your options?

28:27.364 --> 28:29.667
I thought that I w...
I was a part of your options.

28:29.668 --> 28:31.490
Well, you are. You mean, I was.

28:34.305 --> 28:36.767
And what, I can't even...
I can't even visit you?

28:37.043 --> 28:39.691
No, not... I mean,
not at first, anyway.

28:39.692 --> 28:41.128
It... it's what...

28:41.129 --> 28:43.517
W-would you just look at
yourself for a second?

28:43.518 --> 28:45.765
You're... you're... you're charming,
you're handsome.

28:45.766 --> 28:48.257
You... you are so
true to who you are,

28:48.258 --> 28:51.141
and who you are is
an amazing, strong...

28:51.454 --> 28:53.388
And young, right?
That's what you were gonna say.

28:53.389 --> 28:56.140
Young. That's... that's always
been the issue. Just tell me.

28:56.141 --> 28:58.650
You know, you can't go to Washington
with some kid on your arm.

28:58.651 --> 29:00.369
You know what, Seth?
It's a lot more complicated...

29:00.370 --> 29:02.365
Give me the dignity of
being honest, Kitty.

29:03.662 --> 29:06.953
Okay, yeah. Yeah, it is.

29:06.954 --> 29:09.129
It is because you're
too young for me.

29:09.604 --> 29:11.551
I'm sorry. You know what?
You just said it yourself.

29:11.552 --> 29:13.053
It's always been the issue.

29:13.054 --> 29:15.163
Would you please...
please do not leave like this?

29:15.164 --> 29:18.226
Like what? Like what? Upset?

29:19.238 --> 29:21.988
Sorry, that's...
that's not gonna happen.

29:29.829 --> 29:32.379
Nurses' station.
This is Carol... Rick.

29:33.428 --> 29:33.986
Hey.

29:33.987 --> 29:36.700
Hey. I just wanted to say
thanks for offering to help.

29:36.987 --> 29:38.430
But let me ask you a question,
all right?

29:38.431 --> 29:40.906
Are you trying to help me or are
you trying to impress Annie?

29:41.655 --> 29:43.617
I'm not trying to impress anybody.

29:44.130 --> 29:45.492
Listen, that guy...

29:45.929 --> 29:47.981
He's alive because you were
willing to take a risk.

29:48.291 --> 29:49.530
Head of the board agrees with me,

29:49.531 --> 29:51.490
and the inquiry is off.

29:52.062 --> 29:52.760
It's off?

29:52.761 --> 29:53.511
Yeah.

29:54.311 --> 29:56.364
And as far as Annie's concerned,

29:56.573 --> 29:58.812
I haven't seen her this
happy in a very long time.

29:58.813 --> 30:00.325
Gotta think that's 'cause of you.

30:00.775 --> 30:03.051
I just got your message.
It's over?

30:03.052 --> 30:05.601
Yeah. It's like it never happened.

30:05.656 --> 30:07.406
Thank you. Thanks a lot, man.

30:08.033 --> 30:11.406
I'm, uh... I'm glad it
worked out for you guys.

30:12.153 --> 30:13.053
I'm late.

30:13.328 --> 30:14.603
I'll see you later.

30:16.891 --> 30:17.965
Are... are you happy?

30:17.966 --> 30:19.812
Yes, I'm happy and relieved.

30:19.813 --> 30:22.415
Good. I'm so glad.
I gotta get back up to my floor,

30:22.416 --> 30:23.569
but congratulations.

30:23.570 --> 30:24.395
Thank you.

30:35.331 --> 30:37.139
I thought I would find you here.

30:37.140 --> 30:38.914
Did you come to teach me

30:38.915 --> 30:41.916
how to make chutney out
of watermelon rind?

30:43.322 --> 30:44.772
No. Uh...

30:45.509 --> 30:48.847
I-I-I came to apologize for...

30:49.571 --> 30:51.019
For pushing you so hard.

30:51.020 --> 30:53.057
Oh, that's all right.

30:53.670 --> 30:57.144
I know that you did that
because you care about me.

30:57.369 --> 30:59.943
I'm... I'm sorry, too,
for flying off the handle.

30:59.944 --> 31:01.331
Ah, well, that's okay.

31:01.906 --> 31:05.194
Honestly, sometimes I
drive myself crazy.

31:07.256 --> 31:09.949
Actually, you helped a lot.

31:09.950 --> 31:10.892
Really, how?

31:12.242 --> 31:13.694
You woke me up.

31:13.695 --> 31:16.561
You made me realize
that the real problem

31:16.562 --> 31:18.333
isn't that I'm not ready.

31:19.696 --> 31:21.782
It's that I'm terrified.

31:21.783 --> 31:23.183
Well, of course you're terrified.

31:23.184 --> 31:24.862
It's a big step.
Of course you are.

31:24.863 --> 31:27.138
No. I-it's not that.

31:27.875 --> 31:30.860
What if David only
wants me to move there

31:30.861 --> 31:32.685
because he feels responsible?

31:32.686 --> 31:35.996
I can't keep dangling
hope in front of them,

31:35.997 --> 31:37.335
especially Rebecca.

31:38.374 --> 31:39.574
What if...

31:40.461 --> 31:43.173
She never has a mother again?

31:43.174 --> 31:45.505
Oh. Here is her mother,

31:45.506 --> 31:47.484
standing right here
in front of me.

31:47.485 --> 31:49.694
She's not some mystery
from the past.

31:49.695 --> 31:51.813
She's not hiding in
one of these boxes.

31:52.188 --> 31:54.392
This is you. This is who you are...

31:54.393 --> 31:58.298
Holly Harper...
brave and proud and fierce

31:58.299 --> 31:59.546
and crabby...

31:59.921 --> 32:03.408
Loving and beloved
by David and Rebecca,

32:03.409 --> 32:05.995
no matter what you
remember or don't remember.

32:09.335 --> 32:10.478
You... you know, actually,

32:10.479 --> 32:13.860
I-I could send these
boxes to New York

32:13.861 --> 32:15.484
and then look through them later.

32:15.609 --> 32:19.857
Holly... what do you really
want out of all of this?

32:19.858 --> 32:22.120
I mean, here's a box with
tax returns from 1988.

32:22.121 --> 32:25.226
I know, I know, I know,
but it's not all paperwork.

32:25.227 --> 32:28.907
Well, what's this? This is...
this is a box of old playbills.

32:28.908 --> 32:29.843
That's always fun.

32:29.844 --> 32:33.104
Well, I mean, yeah, and
here's a matchbook collection.

32:33.105 --> 32:35.185
Now how can I live
without that? Okay.

32:35.186 --> 32:37.998
There are some things
I want to forget.

32:41.573 --> 32:42.523
What is this?

32:42.617 --> 32:43.454
What?

32:45.267 --> 32:46.467
A picture of me?

32:46.979 --> 32:50.753
Oh. Well, William must
have stored it here.

32:51.104 --> 32:52.429
Do... do you want to keep it?

32:56.113 --> 32:57.027
Holly...

32:58.463 --> 33:02.800
I have an idea what you can
do with all of this stuff.

33:03.476 --> 33:04.926
I'm all ears.

33:09.409 --> 33:11.371
I hope I can do this.

33:14.151 --> 33:16.087
Holly, think of all the people

33:16.088 --> 33:19.159
who would love to start
over with a clean slate.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.953
You can actually do that.

33:20.954 --> 33:23.388
But once it's all gone, it's gone.

33:23.389 --> 33:24.408
Then let it go.

33:25.045 --> 33:26.295
The past...

33:26.311 --> 33:28.971
Sometimes, it's a great big
rock hanging around our necks,

33:28.972 --> 33:30.110
so let it go.

33:30.735 --> 33:32.186
Holly, you can do it.

33:32.923 --> 33:33.785
I can.

33:34.398 --> 33:35.513
I can do it.

33:35.514 --> 33:36.273
Yes.

33:37.008 --> 33:38.270
I can do it.

33:42.465 --> 33:43.378
Whoo!

33:43.379 --> 33:44.363
Ha ha!

33:46.562 --> 33:49.624
You want to give me a hand? No.
It's your past, not mine.

33:56.212 --> 33:58.461
Whoo! Whoo-ho!

34:01.690 --> 34:02.553
Mm.

34:11.797 --> 34:12.885
Jonathan.

34:13.675 --> 34:14.444
Morning.

34:14.445 --> 34:15.378
How's it going?

34:16.791 --> 34:18.550
It's nice here in the mornings,
very quiet. Mm.

34:18.551 --> 34:20.786
People don't start calling
till around 10:00.

34:23.074 --> 34:24.811
I was rude to you yesterday,

34:25.248 --> 34:27.395
very rude, and I...
I want to apologize.

34:27.396 --> 34:29.024
Oh, you don't have to apologize.

34:29.974 --> 34:31.667
You said that you like
to think of yourself

34:31.668 --> 34:34.608
as a different person than the
one that I knew years ago.

34:34.609 --> 34:35.920
I sure hope so.

34:35.920 --> 34:38.998
Well, I am, too.
Yeah. I don't know.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.568
It's such a...
it's such a different world.

34:41.831 --> 34:43.956
I don't really know
exactly when it happened.

34:45.217 --> 34:47.362
Do you know that my
nephew and his husband

34:47.362 --> 34:49.103
are about to become fathers?

34:49.344 --> 34:51.880
I mean, imagine,
when we were in our 30s...

34:51.882 --> 34:52.743
Oh, please.

34:53.143 --> 34:55.690
The only gay fathers I knew
back then were daddies,

34:55.690 --> 34:57.981
and that's not quite the same thing.
No, it's not quite the same.

34:57.982 --> 35:00.262
And... and actually,
I think it took its toll.

35:00.263 --> 35:02.379
I think we paid dearly for it.

35:05.067 --> 35:06.580
I forgive you, Jonathan.

35:07.366 --> 35:10.479
Saul...
No, seriously. Seriously.

35:12.015 --> 35:13.756
You have any idea
how many people died

35:13.757 --> 35:15.878
before they had a chance
to say those words?

35:16.679 --> 35:18.464
Well, some things
are unforgivable.

35:18.465 --> 35:20.423
Yes, that's true. Some things are.

35:20.424 --> 35:22.203
But what you did...

35:23.502 --> 35:25.327
What we did isn't.

35:26.554 --> 35:27.479
Oh, God.

35:29.496 --> 35:32.483
God, how I fantasized about
you for years, Jonathan.

35:32.883 --> 35:35.474
When you were anchoring,
I never missed a broadcast.

35:35.475 --> 35:36.827
Till they kicked me out because

35:36.828 --> 35:38.514
I was...
Because you were a drunk, yes, I know.

35:38.515 --> 35:40.806
And such a cute drunk you were.

35:40.807 --> 35:42.361
But a drunk nonetheless.

35:42.362 --> 35:43.955
Mm. And I ignored it.

35:44.867 --> 35:47.155
Yeah, because I was so
busy flailing around,

35:47.156 --> 35:51.254
trying to connect with someone
because I was so lonely.

35:52.492 --> 35:54.638
The world did not
make it easy for us.

35:54.639 --> 35:58.258
Ah, the world is waking up.
Must be 10:00.

35:59.070 --> 36:00.382
Then I'll leave you to it.

36:02.207 --> 36:03.594
Good morning, Saul.

36:05.082 --> 36:06.332
Good morning, Jonathan.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.981
Outreach. How can I help you?

36:11.019 --> 36:12.644
So this is how it's gonna work.

36:12.645 --> 36:15.942
If there's any more stealing,
there will be consequences.

36:15.943 --> 36:17.980
And if you need money,
talk to us, and we'll decide

36:17.981 --> 36:19.230
whether or not it's appropriate.

36:19.231 --> 36:22.592
Olivia, do you think you could
look at us when we talk to you?

36:23.841 --> 36:25.930
Why do you guys still want me?

36:25.931 --> 36:28.004
Because we're gonna
be your parents,

36:28.005 --> 36:29.800
and there's nothing
you can say or do

36:29.801 --> 36:32.733
that'll change our mind.
But you guys don't know who I am.

36:32.734 --> 36:35.316
Okay. Then tell us. Who are you?

36:35.317 --> 36:37.150
I don't know.
I stole money from you.

36:37.151 --> 36:38.454
You figure it out.

36:39.904 --> 36:41.891
Do you want to know what I think?

36:44.403 --> 36:47.653
I think that you are a beautiful

36:47.800 --> 36:49.610
smart, strong-willed girl

36:49.611 --> 36:52.623
that got scared that things
weren't going to end well.

36:52.966 --> 36:54.591
So you decided to take something,

36:54.592 --> 36:56.956
thinking that's all you could get.

36:57.717 --> 37:00.198
What if you guys decide you
don't like living with me?

37:00.199 --> 37:01.447
That's not an option.

37:01.448 --> 37:04.417
We will learn to get along,
to trust one another.

37:04.418 --> 37:06.559
You know what? I bet we're
gonna love living with you.

37:06.560 --> 37:08.473
And if I don't like
living with you,

37:08.474 --> 37:11.036
I can't change my mind
and come back here?

37:11.386 --> 37:14.186
Well, it would make us very
sad if you weren't happy,

37:14.387 --> 37:16.336
but we're gonna be
a family anyway.

37:16.923 --> 37:19.148
We have a responsibility
to each other now.

37:20.685 --> 37:22.873
I hope we like living
with each other.

37:23.673 --> 37:25.867
I think we're gonna be just fine.

37:28.632 --> 37:30.468
Thanks for the gummi bears.

37:30.894 --> 37:31.880
You're welcome.

37:41.286 --> 37:43.253
Well, you're all set.

37:43.254 --> 37:44.702
The car is packed
up and ready to go.

37:44.703 --> 37:47.495
You are definitely gonna get
hit with an excess luggage fee.

37:47.496 --> 37:51.173
That last suitcase was 100 pounds if
it was an ounce. Well, I'd tip you,

37:51.174 --> 37:54.220
but I think I have to save
my cash for the skycaps.

37:54.248 --> 37:56.388
Well, I've done the
whole idiot check,

37:56.389 --> 37:59.014
and there is not a single
item left in this house.

38:02.226 --> 38:02.976
So...

38:07.220 --> 38:09.458
If you ever want a job,
give me a call.

38:10.146 --> 38:11.807
Careful what you wish for.

38:11.808 --> 38:12.708
I mean it.

38:16.021 --> 38:17.896
Say hi to Rebecca for me,
all right?

38:21.020 --> 38:22.421
I love you, Justin.

38:23.082 --> 38:25.029
Thanks for everything
you've done for me.

38:25.030 --> 38:26.857
Holly! Did I miss her?

38:26.858 --> 38:27.708
Holly!

38:27.871 --> 38:28.696
Ah.

38:29.696 --> 38:32.146
Say your good-byes quickly. We
have to get her to the airport.

38:32.147 --> 38:33.383
I am not saying good-bye.

38:33.384 --> 38:35.865
I go to New York at least twice
a year to gorge on theater,

38:35.866 --> 38:37.765
and I'm gonna take
you wherever I go.

38:38.386 --> 38:41.586
Can't wait. Well...

38:41.999 --> 38:44.249
I don't want to rush you,
but we have to go.

38:45.263 --> 38:47.376
Uh, just give me a second.

38:48.551 --> 38:49.973
Yeah. I'll wait for
you by the car.

38:49.974 --> 38:51.500
Come on, everyone. Let's go.

38:56.512 --> 38:57.412
I'm okay.

38:59.348 --> 39:00.173
Yeah?

39:26.464 --> 39:28.644
So if anybody from my family

39:28.645 --> 39:30.128
should happen to call...

39:30.129 --> 39:31.553
I will tell them that you're out

39:31.554 --> 39:33.401
or that you have a meeting.

39:33.402 --> 39:36.861
Perfect, and then, just,
um, reach me on my cell.

39:37.161 --> 39:37.982
I got it.

39:37.983 --> 39:40.132
Okay, and I'll definitely
call in once a day,

39:40.133 --> 39:44.003
just to say hi and... oh,
who am I kidding?

39:44.004 --> 39:45.602
I'll probably call
ten times a day,

39:45.603 --> 39:47.437
so I apologize in advance.

39:47.438 --> 39:49.683
It's okay. Oh, it broked off

39:49.995 --> 39:51.327
'cause they were unglued.

39:51.328 --> 39:52.716
Well, thank you.

39:54.210 --> 39:56.669
Hey. Hey, come on up here.

39:57.481 --> 39:59.107
I want to tell you
something, okay?

39:59.108 --> 40:00.556
Will you listen to me?

40:01.981 --> 40:04.380
Mama has to go away for a while.

40:04.521 --> 40:07.163
I don't want you to go away.

40:07.164 --> 40:09.842
I know, honey,
but remember what we say?

40:09.843 --> 40:12.304
Mamas always come back.

40:12.305 --> 40:13.530
Yeah.

40:14.492 --> 40:15.742
Yeah, they do.

40:16.110 --> 40:18.535
I love you. Okay.

40:18.536 --> 40:20.409
You want to go play
in the playroom

40:20.410 --> 40:21.880
with Sophie and Jack? Yeah?

40:21.881 --> 40:22.913
Oh, they are so
excited to have you,

40:22.914 --> 40:24.494
Evan. Here. Why don't
you go with Courtney?

40:24.495 --> 40:27.280
They have been waiting all
day for you to arrive.

40:27.281 --> 40:30.470
Yes. Oh, I'm so sorry.
Bye, my darling. I love you.

40:30.471 --> 40:31.533
Say bye to mama?

40:31.534 --> 40:33.611
Bye-bye. I'll see you soon.

40:42.867 --> 40:44.318
How did you find this?

40:44.917 --> 40:47.037
They were in a box
of William's things

40:47.038 --> 40:48.233
in Holly's garage.

40:48.234 --> 40:50.107
She gave 'em to me. So I kept 'em.

40:50.619 --> 40:52.981
Unbelievable.
I thought that I had seen

40:52.982 --> 40:57.218
every frame of Walker family
home movies ever shot.

40:57.927 --> 41:00.335
How many home movies
do you know of

41:00.336 --> 41:02.840
that are shot through
restaurant windows?

41:03.752 --> 41:06.052
So w-what are you saying?

41:07.227 --> 41:08.180
William, my husband...

41:08.181 --> 41:10.494
Well, he wasn't even
my husband yet...

41:10.495 --> 41:12.081
My husband-to-be...

41:13.656 --> 41:15.333
Was having me followed?

41:15.334 --> 41:16.120
Why?

41:16.121 --> 41:17.109
I don't know.

41:17.906 --> 41:23.130
I was dating him
right before William.

41:23.693 --> 41:26.055
His name was Brody.
Do you remember him?

41:26.056 --> 41:28.472
Yeah, I think.
Uh, sort of, vaguely.

41:28.473 --> 41:29.361
There he is.

41:31.534 --> 41:32.446
Ah, well...

41:33.195 --> 41:35.966
That's probably why
William had you followed.

41:38.160 --> 41:39.096
Hmm?

41:39.296 --> 41:49.496
