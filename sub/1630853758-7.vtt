00:09.885 --> 00:11.470
How can anyone navigate this city

00:11.553 --> 00:13.972
when there is a Pret A Manger
on literally every corner?

00:14.473 --> 00:15.891
Can't we ask Scott where it is?

00:15.974 --> 00:17.851
No, he doesn't know I'm coming.

00:17.935 --> 00:18.936
It's a surprise.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.441
How come they're so slow?

00:24.525 --> 00:26.068
Well, they stopped to stroke a cat.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.569
- What? A cat?
- Yes.

00:27.653 --> 00:28.654
God.

00:29.071 --> 00:30.155
Hurry up!

00:32.406 --> 00:34.826
Why are you bringing a muffin basket
to a book launch?

00:34.910 --> 00:35.953
To say "well done."

00:36.745 --> 00:38.664
Freddy keeps sending them to us.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.166
He thinks that's
what being a good person is.

00:43.085 --> 00:44.920
So, what's going on with you and Jason?

00:45.629 --> 00:47.464
- Have you not forgiven him yet?
- Nope.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.384
He lied about us buying the flat,
which we are now losing,

00:50.467 --> 00:53.262
told Bev stuff which she's now using
to try and stop us getting the kids,

00:53.345 --> 00:57.140
and secretly gambled ten grand
of our money, with Scott of all people.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.479
Of all people, he would be
one of the best people to do it with.

01:03.272 --> 01:04.480
- Right.
- But still.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.024
- It's over there.
- Okay.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.860
If you need-- It's over there!

01:07.943 --> 01:11.029
I mean, an economics book though.
Really impressive.

01:11.113 --> 01:12.489
Yeah, I'm made up for him.

01:13.156 --> 01:17.786
I mean, he's really proved Jilly,
Nikki, you, me, his family,

01:17.870 --> 01:22.624
his friends, our friends,
that builder we had round and Karen wrong.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.293
Really chuffed for him.

01:24.376 --> 01:27.546
I mean, we say we don't care what
our daughter's fella does for a living,

01:27.629 --> 01:30.966
as long as he makes her happy,
but we don't really mean it.

01:31.049 --> 01:33.468
I've not been to a literary party before.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.888
Will it be risqué, do you think?
Debauched?

01:36.513 --> 01:37.681
I don't think so, Jill. No.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.978
About bloody time.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.314
How long does it take to stroke a cat?

01:45.397 --> 01:48.192
Well, it was a nice one,
and there was a bit of a queue.

01:50.485 --> 01:51.570
Come on, then.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.127
What the…

02:19.348 --> 02:20.682
What a banker!

02:21.266 --> 02:22.684
Wow. Nice.

02:22.768 --> 02:23.769
Brilliant.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.024
Oh, no.

02:45.415 --> 02:46.834
So glad you could come.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.795
I thought-- Weren't you taking
football practice after school?

02:49.878 --> 02:51.421
No, Amy's covering.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.090
Scott, what is all of this?

02:53.173 --> 02:55.801
No, don't change
your plans for me, Karen. Okay?

02:55.884 --> 02:58.053
If you need to get back,
that's completely okay.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.179
No, it's fine.

02:59.263 --> 03:01.890
What is all of this?
I mean, what are you doing?

03:01.974 --> 03:04.017
He's just the same in real life.

03:05.978 --> 03:06.979
What does she mean?

03:07.062 --> 03:10.774
And why are you pulling
these weird faces in these pictures?

03:14.444 --> 03:15.654
Yeah.

03:15.737 --> 03:16.905
Canapé?

03:20.868 --> 03:22.035
Thank you.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.581
You know you don't have to take one.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.041
Oh, do you not?

03:31.795 --> 03:32.796
Just a second.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.137
- Are those salmon things nice?
- Yeah.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.973
Do you want to take them off me
and give them to Scott?

03:43.056 --> 03:45.601
Maybe in six months, he can give me
three quarters of them back.

03:45.684 --> 03:48.228
Come on. Nikki-- Nik--

03:48.729 --> 03:50.606
If you're coming,
bring more salmon things.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.568
So, they think you're a character?

03:55.068 --> 03:58.280
Yeah, well, I mean,
It's a literary thing, you know?

03:58.363 --> 04:00.657
Like a pen name. Lots of writers do it.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.075
George Eliot did it.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.660
He's very well respected.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.038
Scott, they're laughing at you.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.291
Well, they mocked Jesus to begin with,

04:09.374 --> 04:11.001
and now he's everywhere. Okay?

04:11.084 --> 04:13.504
So if I can get
half the Christmas market share he had--

04:13.587 --> 04:14.505
No!

04:14.588 --> 04:18.132
Scott, got you a groin guard and a helmet.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.637
Miscommunication with the money cannon.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.931
They filled it with coins
instead of notes.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.517
With those on, you won't feel a thing.

04:28.810 --> 04:32.397
No. This is not
the sort of writer you want to be.

04:32.481 --> 04:35.275
Well, I tried. Karen, and I--
This is as far as I've got.

04:36.485 --> 04:38.695
And I don't have the motivation
to try again.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.380
I am sorry that I lied about the flat.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.633
I'm sorry that I gave that money to Scott
to invest without asking you.

04:59.716 --> 05:00.968
- Gamble.
- It wasn't gambling.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.427
Yes, of course it was.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.180
Not everyone can be rich, Jason.

05:05.264 --> 05:08.767
That's just what they tell people like us
so we keep giving them our money.

05:08.851 --> 05:10.894
You didn't even think to ask me!

05:10.978 --> 05:12.896
I wanted to bring you solutions
and not problems.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.607
I'm not one of the kids
you clear a path for.

05:15.691 --> 05:18.527
- I help find solutions.
- There weren't any, babe.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.320
We--

05:21.238 --> 05:22.489
We could've asked my parents.

05:22.573 --> 05:23.991
They haven't got that kind of money.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.660
I mean, they won't even turn on
the big ring on the cooker.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.454
Anyway, I don't want
to take people's savings.

05:29.538 --> 05:32.249
Scott was the best option.
I thought he could short it.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.168
- What does that mean?
- Short it.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.128
That's what those finance guys do
to make money.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.713
They sell short. Short it.

05:37.796 --> 05:39.339
What do you mean, "short it"?

05:39.423 --> 05:40.757
You know, just short it.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.219
- Short it!
- Stop saying "short it"!

05:44.303 --> 05:46.388
It's not like I've swapped them
for magic beans, is it?

05:46.471 --> 05:49.183
I mean, he's an investment banker.
He can't be a complete idiot.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.394
Perfect timing, mate. Thanks very much.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.022
Look, I'm trying to fix it.

05:55.105 --> 05:57.191
That's why I'm doing my taxiing.
I'm making good money.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.610
Yes, another decision
that you took without me.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.404
And on top of everything,

06:02.905 --> 06:05.616
you told Bev all of our problems.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.327
The person standing
in between us and the kids.

06:08.410 --> 06:09.244
I told her that

06:09.328 --> 06:12.206
because I didn't want her to think
that we thought we were better than her,

06:12.289 --> 06:14.833
that we were some perfect family
looking down on her.

06:14.917 --> 06:15.918
But it was stupid.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.461
- Was it?
- Yes!

06:18.795 --> 06:21.256
And we used to make
our stupid decisions together.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.886
And we're not talking like we used to.

06:27.888 --> 06:31.183
- Oh, my God!
- Look, it's surge pricing, all right?

06:32.017 --> 06:33.602
Look, I'm gonna go.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.312
Look, I'm better use to this family

06:35.395 --> 06:37.105
out there than I am
in here right now, okay?

06:37.189 --> 06:39.316
So I'm gonna go, but can we talk later?

06:41.151 --> 06:42.194
Nik?

06:43.820 --> 06:45.697
Okay.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.290
I think I'll just have a boiled egg
when we get home.

06:55.791 --> 06:56.625
Yeah.

06:56.708 --> 06:59.461
Yeah, but I'm sorry. Is this really
the way to sell an economics book?

07:00.045 --> 07:02.840
W-- I wouldn't know.
I don't sell economics books.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.550
I mean, I don't really think anybody does.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.219
- I know, but you are-- You're making him--
- No.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.762
This is a comedy book.

07:08.846 --> 07:12.182
And TBH, the fact that he's being paid
anything at all to write is…

07:12.599 --> 07:13.642
the victory here.

07:14.643 --> 07:15.811
So, when does he get paid?

07:15.894 --> 07:17.229
When he clears the marketing debt,

07:17.312 --> 07:18.730
'cause you know, this ain't cheap.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.983
So, he's paying for all of this?

07:21.066 --> 07:23.443
Yeah, I know, and we really appreciate it.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.737
I'm having a lovely time.

07:26.530 --> 07:30.284
You know, I mean, this company is
massively overleveraged.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.743
All of publishing is on its knees.

07:31.827 --> 07:34.621
Most books don't earn out the advance,
unless you're a chef.

07:34.705 --> 07:36.081
Do you cook at all?

07:38.166 --> 07:39.668
- No.
- Well.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.920
Well, if you know any chefs,
you ever meet a chef,

07:42.004 --> 07:43.672
would you give me a call?

07:44.256 --> 07:45.257
I am sorry, but…

07:45.924 --> 07:49.094
this is just not
the sort of book that he wants it to be.

07:49.178 --> 07:53.432
Look, I'm not the one standing
between Scott and his Booker Prize.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.392
I grew up with people like you, Scott.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.060
Without me, you're not Philip Roth.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.397
You are a San Fran goatee in a turtleneck,

08:00.480 --> 08:04.318
reading poetry and playing bongo drums
to dancing women in black leotards.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.945
You're not a serious man,

08:07.863 --> 08:09.907
and this is the only book
you're ever gonna get.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.201
Excuse us, would you?

08:12.701 --> 08:13.952
Lovely to meet you.

08:14.036 --> 08:15.037
Enjoy.

08:19.208 --> 08:22.294
Well, I think
you have just found your motivation.

08:23.921 --> 08:24.963
Come on.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.174
You're not settling for half a dream.

08:28.425 --> 08:31.303
I am so sorry,
but I think you'll find these are ours.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.679
Enjoying yourselves,
are you, there, girls?

08:33.764 --> 08:35.182
All right, get up. We're going.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.058
Grab as much as you can. Come on.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.894
Yeah, I'll be having those. Thanks.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.813
Moment on the lips and all that.
Right. Come on. Grab the bubbles.

08:41.897 --> 08:43.565
I think you'll find we paid for this.

08:47.110 --> 08:50.280
Come on. Go!

08:50.364 --> 08:51.448
Going!

08:52.658 --> 08:53.992
Our financial adviser there.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.119
Just running down the road
with a plate of goujons.

08:57.246 --> 08:58.247
Come on!

09:17.432 --> 09:20.811
I can't wait for this to be over
so I can go back to hating Freddy.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.521
I'll tell him to stop.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.690
Don't do anything too rash.
These are quality muffins.

09:25.899 --> 09:26.984
All right, what's this?

09:27.359 --> 09:31.280
I got that as a surprise
for Tyler to replace the wrench.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.157
Jase, you can't force love like that.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.493
He's too small anyway.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.454
- He's way too small.
- I think he's cute.

09:39.538 --> 09:42.165
No, I don't like him.
He's too small to hug properly.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.709
What do you want to do with him?

09:43.792 --> 09:47.671
I'm sorry for Tyler, but we'll
have to send him back, get a bigger one.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.339
It's a shame, though, 'cause he is cute.

10:40.098 --> 10:40.933
What's all this?

10:41.725 --> 10:43.810
Jen's coming over later
for a girls' night in.

10:44.186 --> 10:46.146
I wanna make it super calming.

10:48.232 --> 10:49.858
Then I'm gonna fire her.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.487
But Jase, before she gets here,
can we have a chat?

10:53.570 --> 10:55.030
I'm sorry, babe. I'm heading out.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.616
Are you serious?
We still haven't talked yet.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.451
I know, but it's peak time, isn't it?

10:59.535 --> 11:02.246
So two hours now is worth four later.
I'm so-- Can we talk tomorrow?

11:02.329 --> 11:03.539
- Is that okay?
- Jase.

11:03.622 --> 11:04.790
Sorry, Nik. Sorry.

11:10.754 --> 11:11.755
Bye.

11:19.805 --> 11:21.056
This is so nice.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.642
I have this stuff in my gym.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.687
And sometimes my house
after I've been to the gym.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.156
Okay, so…

11:39.032 --> 11:40.826
Jen, there's--

11:40.909 --> 11:41.910
Hi, Jen.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.079
Hi, Princess.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.163
Do you like my tattoo?

11:46.331 --> 11:48.000
That is so cool.

11:48.083 --> 11:51.044
I have six tattoos,
but I can't show you any of them.

11:52.254 --> 11:53.672
I--

11:54.840 --> 11:57.176
Make sure you keep that on
for the recommended time.

11:57.259 --> 11:58.260
Okay.

11:58.343 --> 12:01.388
If she stays looking younger, I can keep
taking her on the buses for free.

12:07.978 --> 12:08.979
Right.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.649
- So, Jen--
- So, quick question from me.

12:14.443 --> 12:15.903
How do you know if you're depressed?

12:16.987 --> 12:18.614
Jen, what's the matter?

12:18.697 --> 12:22.034
I wanna be with Tinkle,
but I don't think she wants to be with me.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.745
Why would you want to be with someone
who doesn't want to be with you?

12:24.828 --> 12:26.330
'Cause they're normally the best ones.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.331
Okay, yeah.

12:27.915 --> 12:28.957
We're seeing other people,

12:29.041 --> 12:31.418
and she's used the word "casual,"
like, 17 times.

12:31.502 --> 12:32.544
Oh, my God.

12:32.628 --> 12:36.507
Every generation thinks
they've cracked no-strings sex.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.634
Jen, no one has cracked it.

12:38.717 --> 12:42.930
We need the strings. The strings are good.
The strings are what hold us together.

12:44.348 --> 12:47.100
I've just spent so much time
focusing on my career.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.562
And now I've achieved all my goals there…

12:51.063 --> 12:53.398
I think it's time
I applied that effort to my love life.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.609
I need someone I can rely on.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.945
I need to stop going
for hot people on MDMA

12:58.028 --> 13:00.656
and find someone nice
on an apprenticeship, you know?

13:02.157 --> 13:04.409
I need to fall in love.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.205
Well, love doesn't just happen to you.

13:09.248 --> 13:10.582
It isn't a spell.

13:11.667 --> 13:12.918
It's a job.

13:14.169 --> 13:15.629
It's hard work.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.466
But if you want it, you'll find it.

13:21.260 --> 13:22.636
You're so kind to me.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.264
You're literally
the kindest person I know.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.184
What was it you wanted to talk about?

13:31.603 --> 13:33.397
- It doesn't matter.
- Okay.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.092
Why are you working in here?

14:02.176 --> 14:05.470
My office was too close to the kitchen,
and I just couldn't concentrate.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.936
- How's it going?
- Yeah, it's good. Yeah.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.730
Just rocketing along.

14:17.858 --> 14:20.485
Remember, need five pages by bedtime.

14:20.569 --> 14:21.820
Sure.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.947
Tonight? Sure.

14:25.407 --> 14:26.950
Can I make the font bigger at all?

14:27.034 --> 14:28.577
No, you cannot.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.538
It's not-- I don't--
It's not really ready for eyes.

14:31.622 --> 14:32.706
Oh, shut up.

14:38.754 --> 14:41.256
It's fine. It's just--

14:41.715 --> 14:43.550
Do you really need all those words?

14:43.634 --> 14:45.344
Words are my children, Karen.

14:45.844 --> 14:47.221
It's very hard to let them go.

14:47.304 --> 14:51.141
Well, what I say to my children is,
"Keep it short, and keep it clear."

14:51.767 --> 14:52.768
Trust me.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.937
When you're looking at 30 lots
of homework every night,

14:55.020 --> 14:56.772
you see the value in direct writing.

14:56.855 --> 14:58.774
Right, come on. Budge up.

14:58.857 --> 14:59.900
All right.

15:00.776 --> 15:01.777
Right.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.195
We don't need that.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.450
- Right. What do you want to happen?
- I want there to--

15:10.369 --> 15:13.789
She goes to see her husband to tell him
it's over, and when she gets there,

15:13.872 --> 15:16.542
she discovers he's been murdered.

15:17.292 --> 15:19.753
Okay.
Well, why don't you just write that then?

15:22.130 --> 15:23.215
There…

15:24.299 --> 15:27.386
was so much blood,

15:28.095 --> 15:32.891
she could taste metal in the air.

15:33.517 --> 15:35.519
She wanted it over,

15:37.062 --> 15:38.105
but not like this.

15:44.736 --> 15:48.282
That's very good, isn't it? Very-- Yeah.

15:49.741 --> 15:50.784
How about that?

15:53.245 --> 15:54.454
It's very Chandleresque.

15:55.664 --> 15:56.665
Really?

15:57.416 --> 15:58.417
Yeah.

16:00.627 --> 16:01.712
You carry on.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.007
Do more.

16:09.344 --> 16:10.345
Okay then.

16:41.502 --> 16:42.503
What are you doing?

16:44.922 --> 16:47.549
We need to talk, and this is
the only way I'm gonna see you.

16:48.217 --> 16:50.511
I'm paying you. You can't not pick me up.

16:50.594 --> 16:51.762
But this is stupid.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.180
We're a rocket, Jason.

16:53.263 --> 16:54.973
This family is a rocket.

16:55.057 --> 16:58.977
And if that rocket is off,
just even by a tiny bit, then you--

16:59.061 --> 17:00.854
Well, you end up not where you wanna be.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.023
Or on fire.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.318
Either way, you have to fix it early.

17:06.401 --> 17:07.903
Can we fix it not in surge time, please?

17:07.986 --> 17:09.863
No, it's always bloody surge time.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.782
And I think that's something
that they might have made up.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.826
Well, I'm not driving about
wasting my petrol.

17:14.910 --> 17:17.412
Fine. That's fine. We can just sit here.

17:19.248 --> 17:20.290
Together.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.086
- And if you don't…
- What?

17:24.169 --> 17:25.671
…I'm gonna give you one star.

17:26.547 --> 17:29.299
What will that do to your rating
so early on, I wonder?

17:29.383 --> 17:30.634
- Don't do that.
- I'm gonna do it.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.011
- I'm gonna do-- I'll do it. I will do it.
- Don't do that.

17:33.095 --> 17:34.263
Okay!

17:35.138 --> 17:36.181
Okay. Fine.

17:38.392 --> 17:40.435
- Hang on. Who's looking after the kids?
- Jen.

17:40.519 --> 17:41.645
What?

17:41.728 --> 17:44.231
It's fine. She's very responsible.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.991
Well, the thing about homework is,

17:54.074 --> 17:55.284
you work really hard in school,

17:55.367 --> 17:58.745
and then you get older and realize
you don't really use any of it day-to-day.

17:58.829 --> 18:02.165
So, honestly, I would just chill out
and live your story, you know?

18:06.003 --> 18:07.629
You're too small for that.

18:09.339 --> 18:10.549
Like these.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.427
- Hey?
- Can I have coffee?

18:13.510 --> 18:15.137
No, Tyler. No.

18:16.597 --> 18:17.806
That's not how you ask.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.516
Please, may I have coffee?

18:19.600 --> 18:21.476
That's better. Yes, you may.

18:23.979 --> 18:25.189
Tyler!

18:26.231 --> 18:27.482
You mustn't waste coffee.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.152
Things are slipping.

19:12.236 --> 19:13.779
What do you mean, "slipping"?
What's slipping?

19:13.862 --> 19:16.323
Us. Stuff.

19:18.033 --> 19:21.495
I don't know. I don't know, Jase.
I can just-- I feel it.

19:24.623 --> 19:25.916
Are we not up to this?

19:25.999 --> 19:27.584
Of course we are up to this.

19:27.668 --> 19:30.546
They told us, didn't they?
They said this was gonna be difficult.

19:30.629 --> 19:33.298
Yes, but obviously I didn't believe them.

19:33.382 --> 19:35.884
Obviously, I thought
that we were the exception.

19:36.468 --> 19:38.679
'Cause everyone's always said
that relationships are hard,

19:38.762 --> 19:40.764
but that's never been the case for us.

19:41.390 --> 19:46.311
Everything else in my life was hard,
but this just never was.

19:48.438 --> 19:54.570
Maybe we just need to get used to
being with each other

19:54.653 --> 19:56.238
in a different way, you know?

19:56.321 --> 19:59.658
Maybe we just have to
get used to-- to trying harder.

20:02.202 --> 20:06.206
Can we just be honest
about how we're feeling?

20:07.040 --> 20:09.001
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

20:12.671 --> 20:14.715
Well, you-- I meant you, mainly.

20:16.592 --> 20:19.344
I find it really difficult that
I'm not able to contribute financially

20:19.428 --> 20:20.429
in the way that you are.

20:20.512 --> 20:23.307
Yeah. No, but that's because
you're doing most of the parenting.

20:25.893 --> 20:27.728
And I feel bad about that.

20:30.606 --> 20:31.607
And I'm…

20:33.233 --> 20:34.818
I'm worried that Bev's right.

20:39.114 --> 20:41.450
What if we're not the best thing
for these kids?

20:41.533 --> 20:42.743
I mean, how would we know?

20:45.120 --> 20:47.873
I mean, how do we know
that they even wanna stay with us?

20:58.550 --> 21:01.136
- Tyler, what are you doing up?
- I can't sleep.

21:01.637 --> 21:03.138
Yeah, it's probably the coffee.

21:03.722 --> 21:05.474
You should maybe consider
switching to decaf.

21:06.350 --> 21:08.477
Jen, when will I be bigger?

21:08.560 --> 21:11.855
Well, the thing is,
you won't really notice it.

21:11.939 --> 21:14.149
One day you'll just wake up,
and you'll be big.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.862
Back to bed. I need to get
your pajamas in the wash.

21:49.017 --> 21:51.186
We haven't spoken like this
in a while, have we?

21:51.270 --> 21:52.354
No.

21:55.732 --> 21:59.152
I think emotional chats are easier
when you're not facing each other.

21:59.945 --> 22:01.196
Yeah?

22:01.780 --> 22:04.074
- It's in all the parenting books.
- Parenting books.

22:04.658 --> 22:07.327
I knew you were just
folding down the pages.

22:07.411 --> 22:10.289
I haven't been folding down the pages.
I've read them all.

22:13.709 --> 22:14.835
Have you got any tissues?

22:14.918 --> 22:16.003
- In the glove box.
- Okay.

22:21.967 --> 22:23.427
Jason.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.512
I just put that there to get more tips.

22:32.686 --> 22:34.104
Will you drive me home, please?

22:35.355 --> 22:36.356
Of course.

22:53.165 --> 22:54.541
Everything's gonna be okay.

22:57.127 --> 22:59.505
Because we have a good love.

23:01.548 --> 23:02.966
One that can survive life.

23:15.145 --> 23:16.146
What?

23:16.897 --> 23:19.900
Well, there's just
a lot of difficult things in there.

23:25.030 --> 23:26.573
Can I have the car for a bit?

23:29.201 --> 23:30.994
So I guess it's back on the apps I go.

23:31.078 --> 23:32.120
Yeah.

23:32.496 --> 23:33.914
I'm just so sick of it.

23:33.997 --> 23:34.998
I mean, look.

23:36.708 --> 23:39.461
Don't put a dog in your profile picture
if it's not yours.

23:39.545 --> 23:40.671
It's misleading.

23:42.506 --> 23:44.174
Jen, I have to tell you something.

23:44.258 --> 23:47.469
So it turns out it's his auntie's,
so he does have access to it.

23:47.553 --> 23:49.763
But this picture heavily implies
it's part of his everyday life,

23:49.847 --> 23:50.973
- and I think he knows that.
- Jen.

23:51.056 --> 23:52.099
Yeah?

23:53.684 --> 23:55.811
No, I need us to both face forward,

23:55.894 --> 23:57.563
'cause I find this very hard.

23:58.564 --> 23:59.606
Driving?

24:00.357 --> 24:02.609
Yeah, you definitely face forward
for driving.

24:07.155 --> 24:08.156
I'm so sorry.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.241
I have to fire you.

24:11.285 --> 24:13.036
- What?
- Keep looking ahead.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.914
Please, Jen. It's the only way,
otherwise I'll start crying.

24:21.170 --> 24:22.963
I just wanted you to hear it from me.

24:24.298 --> 24:25.382
Okay.

24:25.465 --> 24:26.592
I love you.

24:28.260 --> 24:30.387
This is the start for you.

24:30.470 --> 24:31.805
It's not the end.

24:34.016 --> 24:36.185
I believe in you and all you can do.

24:37.686 --> 24:39.938
Start taking yourself seriously.

24:40.022 --> 24:42.024
It's time to stop being passive.

24:43.108 --> 24:44.276
Demand more.

24:45.194 --> 24:48.822
You decide what you want from your life,
and you go for it.

24:49.823 --> 24:51.074
Okay?

24:52.326 --> 24:53.327
Okay.

25:02.252 --> 25:03.504
I know something I want.

26:48.984 --> 26:50.194
Yes!

26:51.737 --> 26:53.322
I'm big!

26:53.906 --> 26:54.907
Okay.

27:17.179 --> 27:18.222
Next week?
